19:06:01 BEFORE WE GET INTO THIS 
EVENING'S
19:06:04  BUSINESS, AS YOU KNOW, 
KATHY
19:06:08  McDONALD LECHED
19:06:12  LEFT THE 
COMMISSION, WE
19:06:15  LEFT A SPOT ON 
THE AGENDA TO
19:06:19  HONOR HER FOR HER 
YEARS OF SERVICE
19:06:22 .
JOEL WILL PRESENT HER WITH
19:06:25  A 
COMMENDATION.
WILL YOU DO THAT
19:06:28  JOEL?
>> Planner Pullen:   YES, WE'VE 
HAD
19:06:32  A LOT OF TURNOVER ON THE 
COMMISSION
19:06:36 .
DAN CARDENAS COULD NOT
19:06:39  BE HERE 
TONIGHT, I PLANNED TO
19:06:42  HONOR HIM 
AS WELL AS COMMISSIONER 
McDONALD BUT WE ARE
19:06:45  GOING TO 
DO THAT IN THE NEXT MEETING IN 
FEBRUARY
19:06:48  WHEN HE'S AVAILABLE.
THE MAYOR AND COUNCIL HAVE
19:06:52  
ALREADY FILLED COMMISSIONER 
McDONALD'S SEAT WITH THE
19:06:55  
NEWEST COMMISSIONER
19:06:58  YONGGANG 
ZHANG.
I WANTED TO TALK A LITTLE BIT 

19:07:01 ABOUT KATHY AND READ SOMETHING.
JUST TO START WITH
19:07:04 , KATHY HAS 
BEEN HERE
19:07:08  SINCE 2017 AND SERVED 
FOR JUST ABOUT FIVE YEARS.
SO
19:07:11  I'M GOING TO READ SOMETHING 
HERE.
IN PERSON WE WOULD ORDINARILY
19:07:15  
COME UP TO THE MICROPHONE AND 
SHARE IT
19:07:18  AND TAKE SOME PICTURES 
AND SIGN IT AFTER THE MEETING
19:07:21 .
BUT I'LL HAVE TO SEND THIS 
AROUND
19:07:24  VIRTUALLY TO SIGN AND 
GIVE IT TO KATHY
19:07:28  FOR A SMALL  
MEMENTO
19:07:32  FOR THE TIME SHE SPENT 
WITH US HERE.

19:07:36 GIVE ME ONE MOMENT.
ALL RIGHT.
SO THIS IS A RESOLUTION
19:07:40  OF 
APPRECIATION AND COMMENDATION 
FOR
19:07:44  KATHY MCDONALD.
WHEREAS THE CITY DID ON
19:07:47  FEBRUARY 
7th, 2017, UPON
19:07:51  THE
19:07:54  
APPOINTMENT OF THE MAYOR, AND 
THE COMMISSION
19:07:58  DID REAPPOINT 
KATHY MCDONALD ON
19:08:02  DECEMBER, 
2020, AND SHE
19:08:05  SERVED IN THE 
2021.
FOR A
19:08:08  FULL LENGTH OF SERVICE OF 
FOUR MONTHS
19:08:13  YEARS AND FIVE MONTHS AND
19:08:16  
21 DAYS.
KATHY
19:08:19  MCDONALD HAS SERVED WITH 
DILIGENCE DURING HER
19:08:22  TENURE, 
REVIEWING DOCUMENTS THOROUGHLY
19:08:26 , 
CONSISTENTLY ADVOCATING FOR
19:08:31  
IMPROVEMENTS IN THE COMMUNITY.
COMMERCIAL, INDUSTRIAL
19:08:34 , 
RESIDENTIAL AND PUBLIC PROJECTS.
WHEREAS KATHY HAS SERVED
19:08:37  THE 
COMMUNITY WITH DISTINCTION IN A 
VARIETY OF CAPACITIES
19:08:40  SUCH AS 
VOLUNTEERING AT THE
19:08:43  TRI-CITIES 
ANIMAL SHERL, PREPARING FOOD
19:08:47  AT 
ABODE SERVICES, BEING A MEMBER
19:08:50  
OF THE STEERING COMMITTEE AND 
SERVING FOOD WITH THE PROGRAM 

19:08:53 THREE TIMES A WEEK, THAT'S A LOT 
OF HARD WORK.
WHEREAS KATHY IS
19:08:56  A LONG TIME 
RESIDENT IN FREMONT,
19:08:59  WHEREAS SHE 
PARTICIPATED IN NUMEROUS
19:09:03  
OPPORTUNITIES INCLUDING
19:09:07  FREMONT 
UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT 
OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE,
19:09:11  AND WHEREAS 
KATHY HAS BEEN INSTRUMENTAL
19:09:14  IN 
ADVOCATING FOR
19:09:18  HOLELESS AND FOR 
THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT.
19:09:21 
NOW THEREFORE BIFT, THE
19:09:25  FREMONT 
PLANNING COMMISSION EXPRESSES 
ITS SINCERE
19:09:28  APPRECIATION TO 
KATHY MCDONALD FOR HER SERVICE
19:09:30  
IN THE COMMISSION.
BEFORE WE GET INTO THE 

19:09:34 COMMISSION'S COMMENTS AND 
ANYTHING SANTA KATHY MIGHT WANT 
TO SAY, I JUST
19:09:37  WANT TO SAY KATHY 
LIKE SOME FOLKS
19:09:40  I KNOW HAS 
REALLY TAKEN HER SERVICE
19:09:43  TO THE 
COMMISSION TO A HIGH LEVEL
19:09:46 .
AND JUST TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF 
THE EXTENT OF HER
19:09:49  SORT OF 
CONNECTION WITH THE COMMUNITY 
AND WITH THE
19:09:53  PROFESSIONAL 
DUTIES, I RECALL NOT TOO LONG 
AGO ON
19:09:56  THE WEEKEND, YOU KNOW, 
GETTING A CALL FROM KATHY, WHILE
19:09:59  
SHE WAS BIKING IN PART OF TOWN 
AND
19:10:02  SAYING, YOU KNOW, CONNECTING 
THAT BIKING TO,
19:10:06  YOU KNOW, 
SOMETHING THAT WAS GOING ON IN 
TOWN SAYING, YOU KNOW, I HAVE
19:10:09  AN 
IDEA.
YOU KNOW, SO KATHY IS THAT
19:10:12  KIND 
OF PERSONAL WHERE SHE CARED, YOU 
KNOW?

19:10:15 YOU COULD SHOW UP AT THE 
COMMISSION AND MAKE A DECISION
19:10:18  
AND GO ON BUT KATHY WAS LIVING 
IT AND CONNECTING HOW
19:10:21  HER 
SERVICE IS ALSO BETTERING HER 
COMMUNITY
19:10:24  AND I APPRECIATE IT.
BACK TO YOU CHAIR.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   YES
19:10:27 , 
THAT'S GREAT JOEL.
I'D LIKE TO SORT OF OPEN
19:10:30  THE 
FLOOR TO THE -- TO MY FELLOW

COMMISSIONERS, ANYONE WHO WOULD 
LIKE TO MAKE A COMMENT REGARDING
19:10:39

19:10:42 -COMMISSIONER 
McDONALD'S SERVICE TO THE CITY 
OF FREMONT
19:10:45  IS MOST WELCOME.
I CAN START.
I
19:10:48  CAN SAY, I MEAN, KATHY RAN
19:10:52  FOR 
CITY COUNCIL, I BELIEVE.
AND ON TOP OF
19:10:55  ALL THAT OTHER 
GOOD STUFF.
I THINK SHE DID IT AS
19:10:58  A FAVOR TO 
A FRIEND.
IT WAS LIKE WOW
19:11:02 !
KATHY, I WILL MISS YOU HERE 
ENTIRELY,
19:11:05  AND I MEAN THAT 
SINCERELY, I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M 
GOING TO
19:11:09  DO.
[ Laughter ]
BUT
19:11:13  I REALLY WISH YOU ALL THE 
BEST IN
19:11:16  YOUR FUTURE ENDEAVORS 
AND I KNOW THEY'RE GOING TO BE
19:11:19  
SUNNY, WARM AND SORT OF SAILING 
AROUND.

19:11:22 YEAH.

19:11:29 
BEN, CHAIR RECOGNIZES BEN YEE
19:11:31 .
>> Commissioner Yee:   THANK YOU 
CHAIR.

19:11:34 YEAH, I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE TO 
BEGIN WITH KATHY
19:11:37 .
I'VE KNOWN HER A LONG TIME AS 
WELL
19:11:41 .
ALWAYS JUST LIKE A FELLOW 
NEIGHBOR JUST DOWN
19:11:44  THE ROAD IN 
THE SAME AREA OF TOWN.
AND I'M
19:11:48  ALSO GOING TO MISS HER 
TOO SHE'S A
19:11:51  FELLOW CYCLIST JUST 
LIKE ME.
SHE GOES ALL OVER
19:11:55  THE CITY 
EXPLORING.
I NEVER GOT A CHANCE TO ACTUALLY
19:11:58  
GO RIDINGS WITH HER.
NOW I'M KIND OF REGRETTING I 

19:12:01 COULD HAVE DONE THAT SOONER.
BUT ONE OF THE
19:12:04  THINGS I MOST 
ADMIRE BY I'LL SAY IT
19:12:08  STILL 
COMMISSIONER McDONALD IS THE 
PRO FORMAISM AND
19:12:11  HER EXPERTISE 
SHE
19:12:15  BRINGS -- THE IS
19:12:17  
PROFESSIONALISM AND HER 
EXPERTISE SHE BRINGS TO THE 

19:12:20 COMMISSION.
THE DETAILS SHE BRINGS TO ALL
19:12:22  
THE FREMONT RESIDENTS THROUGHOUT 
THE CITY.

19:12:25 SO I JUST WANTED TO ECHO 
EVERYBODY
19:12:28  ELSE'S THOUGHTS THAT 
YOU BRING A LOT TO THE CITY AND 
WE'RE
19:12:31  GOING TO MISS YOU.

19:12:48 >> Commissioner Zhang:   THANK

I NEVER MEET YOU IN PERSON BUT
19:12:51  I

THINGS
19:12:54  YOU'VE DONE IN THE SCHOOL 
BOARD.
IT IS AN
19:12:58  HONOR TO BE APPOINTED

BOARD.
19:13:01 
HOPEFULLY I WON'T LET YOU DOWN
19:13:04 .

19:13:32  I'M 
GOING TO MISS HER, I'LL MISS THE 
WALKS WITH HER AND
19:13:35  I'LL ALSO

19:13:52 >> Commissioner Daulton:   
COMMISSIONER LIU.
>> Commissioner Liu:   YES
19:13:55 , I 
HAVE ALWAYS BEEN VERY IMPRESSED 
WITH COMMISSIONER McDONALD
19:13:58 'S 
PROFESSIONALISM AND
19:14:01  HER DETAILED 
QUESTIONING OF ALL THE
19:14:04  PROJECTS 
THAT WERE PRESENTED TO HER, TO 
US.

19:14:07 AND SHE ALWAYS ASKED VERY, VERY 
GOOD QUESTIONS AND
19:14:10  SHE CERTAINLY 
HAD PUSHED FOR THE CAUSES
19:14:14  THAT 
SHE BELIEVES IN, THE BIKE LANES 
AND
19:14:17  THE BIKE PARKING AND ALL 
THESE VARIOUS PROJECTS.
19:14:21 
AND SHE'S DONE A VERY GOOD JOB 
FOR OUR COMMUNITY
19:14:24 .
AND BEST WISHES TO YOU, KATHY.

19:14:29 >> Commissioner Daulton:   
NICELY SAID, ALL.
19:14:33 
THANK YOU FOR THAT.

19:14:38 SO WE'RE GOING TO JOIN OUR 
REGULARLY
19:14:42  SCHEDULED MEETING, 
UNLESS
19:14:45  KATHY, IF YOU WANT TO
19:14:49  SAY 
SOMETHING?
>> Commissioner McDonald:  
19:14:52  YES, 
DON'T I ALWAYS?
>> Commissioner Daulton:   YES
19:14:55 .
>> Commissioner McDonald:   I 
WANT TO SAY THANK YOU EVERYONE.

19:14:58 IT'S TRULY BEEN AN HONOR AND A 
PRIVILEGE TO
19:15:01  SERVE YOU ALL, THE 
COMMISSION AND THE CITY.
19:15:04 
I'VE LIVED A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT 
PLACES AS I'VE MENTIONED
19:15:07  
NUMEROUS TIMES.
AND I'VE NEVER BEEN SO
19:15:11  INVOLVED 
IN A CITY, NEVER FOUND SUCH A 
PROGRESSIVE
19:15:15  PLACE TO LIVE.
AND I DON'T THINK I'VE
19:15:18  EVER 
LEARNED SO MUCH IN
19:15:22  THE SPAN OF 
LIVING IN A PLACE.
LEARNED ABOUT
19:15:25  FREMONT, LEARNED 
ABOUT THE PEOPLE, AND
19:15:28  THE 
SPECIAL UNIQUE PERSPECTIVES THAT 
EACH ONE OF
19:15:31  YOU HAS BROUGHT TO 
THE COMMISSION
19:15:34  AND TO THE 
DEVELOPMENT OF THE CITY.
19:15:41 
SO I FEEL KIND OF -- IT'S
19:15:44  SAD 
FOR ME TO LEAVE BECAUSE I 
FINALLY FEEL YOU
19:15:47  KNOW JUST A 
MODICUM
19:15:51  OF
19:15:55  COMPETENCE OF WHAT 
I'VE BEEN DOING AND I KIND OF 
FEEL
19:15:59  I FOUND MY VOICE AND AN 
ABILITY TO YOU KNOW SPEAK
19:16:02 .
THE THINGS THAT
19:16:06  I AM PASSIONATE 
ABOUT.
SO IT HAS
19:16:09  BEEN WONDERFUL.
I WILL MISS ALL OF YOU.
I
19:16:13  WISH NEW
19:16:20  COMMISSIONER ZHANG 
ALL THE LUCK MOVING FORWARD.
WE'VE HAD SOME
19:16:23  VERY HEATED 
DISCUSSIONS AND IT WAS TRULY A
19:16:26  
LEARNING EXPERIENCE FOR ME AND I 
WISH YOU ALL THE BEST.

19:16:29 IF YOU GUYS ARE IN RENO ANY TIME 
COME ON BY
19:16:32 .
I'LL SERVE YOU A DRINK.
SO GOOD
19:16:35  LUCK, AND THANK YOU VERY 
MUCH FOR THE HONOR OF SERVE
19:16:38 ING 
WITH YOU.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   THANK 

19:16:41 YOU, COMMISSIONER, VERY PROUD TO 
CALL YOU MY FRIEND
19:16:44  AND I'M GOING 
TO TAKE YOU UP ON THAT OFFER IN 
RENO
19:16:47 .
DEFINITELY.
>> Commissioner McDonald:   ANY 

19:16:52 TIME.
SO MAYBE YOU'LL
19:16:55  WANT TO BIKE UP!
19:16:57 
>> Commissioner Daulton:   ALL 
RIGHT, SOUNDS GOOD.

19:17:00 ALL RIGHT.
ON WE GO, THEN.

19:17:08 SO I BELIEVE WE HAVE TWO SETS OF 
MINUTES
19:17:12  IN THE PACKET FOR 
REVIEW.
SO IF I CAN GET
19:17:15  A MOTION FROM 
ONE OF THE COMMISSIONERS TO 
APPROVE MINUTES.

19:17:21 >> Commissioner Steckler:   SO 
MOVE.

19:17:24 >> Commissioner Daulton:   AND 
DO I HAVE A SECOND?
>> Commissioner Yee:  
19:17:27  I'LL 
SECOND.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   OKAY.

19:17:30 JOEL I THINK CAN YOU CALL THE 
VOTE ON THAT PLEASE
19:17:33 .
>> Planner Pullen:   ON A MOTION
19:17:36  
BY COMMISSIONER STECKLER, 
SECONDED BY CONNIE
19:17:40  COMMISSIONER YEE, 
PLEASE VOTE WHEN YOU HEAR
19:17:44  YOUR 
NAME.
CHAIR DAULTON, AYE.
19:17:47 
VICE CHAIR
19:17:50  RAO, AYE.
19:17:53 
COMMISSIONER YEE, AYE.
COMMISSIONER STECKLER
19:17:56 , AYE.
COMMISSIONER LIU,
19:18:00  AYE AND NEW 
COMMISSIONER ZHANG
19:18:03 .
AYE.
THE MINUTES ARE APPROVED.

19:18:06 BACK TO YOU
19:18:11  COMMISSIONER.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   NOW 
WE HAVE
19:18:15  ANY DISCLOSURES 
REGARDING ANY ITEMS ON THE 
AGENDA
19:18:18 .
I HAVE THREE DISCLOSURES.
I VISITED
19:18:21  ALL THREE SITES.
I WALKED
19:18:25  THE SITE
19:18:30  OF THE 
WAREHOUSES AND I SPOKE TO
19:18:33  THE 
NEIGHBORING BUSINESSES REGARDING
19:18:38  
THE KARAOKE BUSINESS.

19:18:44 CRAIG.
>> Commissioner Steckler:   YES, 
I RAISED MY
19:18:48  HAND, FIRST LET ME 
SAY THAT I
19:18:51  DID VISIT ALL THREE 
SITES.
I ALSO WALKED ONE OF
19:18:55  THEM.
BUT I RAISE MY HANT TO SEE
19:18:58  HAND TO SEE IF 
THERE IS A TECHNICAL REASON
19:19:01  THAT 
WE COULD NOT MOVE ITEM 2 TO THE 
CONSENT CALENDAR
19:19:04 .
SO JOEL, CAN YOU ANSWER THAT FOR
19:19:07  
ME?
19:19:11 
>> Planner Pullen:   WE 
ORDINARILY DON'T HAVE
19:19:14  A CONSENT 
CALENDAR ANY LONGER.
THAT'S
19:19:17  NOT SOMETHING THAT WE'VE 
HAD FOR SOME TIME AND
19:19:20  THERE'S 
SOME LEGAL REASONS WHY WE CHOSE 
TO CHANGE THAT.
19:19:24 
WE ARE RECOMMENDING A 
CONTINUANCE.
19:19:27 
BUT BECAUSE THE ITEM'S BEEN 
CALENDARED, THE COMMISSION NEEDS 

19:19:31 TO TAKE A VOTE.
NOW BECAUSE IT'S BEEN CONTINUED
19:19:34  
AND THAT'S THE MESSAGE TO THE 
APPLICANT
19:19:37 , AS WELL AS INTERESTED 
PARTIES WHO
19:19:40  WOULD HAVE SHOWN UP 
IN SUPPORT OR AGAINST
19:19:43  THE 
PROJECT, THAT'S SORT OF A 
ROUTINE
19:19:47  ITEM TO PUSH IT TO THE 
NEXT MEETING.
>> Commissioner Steckler: 
19:19:49   
THANK YOU.
>> Planner Pullen:   SO IT 

19:19:54 DOESN'T MEAN TO BE HANDLED.
>> Commissioner Steckler:   
THAT'S ALL I HAVE
19:19:57  COMMISSIONER.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   ALL 
RIGHT,
19:20:02  THANK YOU COMMISSIONER 
STECKLER.
COMMISSIONER YEE
19:20:05  ANY 
DISCLOSURES?
19:20:08 
>> Commissioner Yee:   I GUESS 
SINCE THE FIRST ONE'S BEING 

19:20:12 TABLED, I ACTUALLY WENT TO ALL 
THREE SITES
19:20:15 , SPOKE TO A NUMBER 
OF THE BUSINESSES AT ALL THREE 
LOCATIONS
19:20:18  AS WELL.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   
COMMISSIONER LIU.
19:20:21 
>> Commissioner Liu:   I VISITED 
ALL THREE SITES ALSO AND
19:20:24  SPOKE 
WITH THE NEIGHBORS
19:20:27  OF -- NEXT TO 
THE ALL THREE SITES.

19:20:34 >> Commissioner Daulton:   
COMMISSIONER ZHANG.
19:20:37 
>> Commissioner Zhang:   I 
DIDN'T VISIT THE SITES BECAUSE I 

19:20:40 GOT THE MESSAGE YESTERDAY BUT I 
MADE A PHONE CALL
19:20:44  TO THE 
RESTAURANT NEXT TO THE KARAOKE 
SITE JUST TO CONFIRM THAT THEY
19:20:48  
ARE ALREADY SELLING BEERS OR 
NOT.
19:20:51 
I DIDN'T EXPOSE MY IDENTITY.
19:20:54 
YES, THAT'S ALL I NEED.
>> Commissioner Daulton:  
19:20:58  AND 
COMMISSIONER RAO.
>> Commissioner Rao:   I JUST 

19:21:02 DROVE BY ALL THESE SITES.
THAT'S IT.
JUST DROVE BY
19:21:03 .
>> Commissioner Daulton:   ALL 
RIGHT.

19:21:08 SINCE WE DO NOT HAVE A CONSENT 
CALENDAR ANYMORE, WE
19:21:12  CAN SKIP 
MERRILY PAST THAT
19:21:15  ONE AND GO ON 
TO THE PUBLIC AND ORAL 
COMMUNICATIONS.
19:21:18 
SO I'D LIKE TO OPEN THAT PORTION 
OF OUR MEETING.

19:21:21 IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK ABOUT 
ANYTHING NOT ON
19:21:24  TONIGHT'S 
AGENDA,
19:21:28  PLEASE VIRTUALLY RAISE 
YOUR HAND NOW.
OR
19:21:31  STAR 9 ON THE PHONE AND EACH 
SPEAKER WILL HAVE TWO
19:21:34  MINUTES 
TONIGHT.
WE'LL PAUSE FOR A MOMENT AND ASK 

19:21:37 THE RECORDING CLERK TRISH
19:21:40  
CORDOVA IF ANYONE HAS RAISED
19:21:43  
THEIR HAND FOR ORAL 
COMMUNICATIONS.

19:21:46 TRISH.
>> CHAIR DAULTON, I
19:21:49  DON'T SEE 
ANY RAISED HANDS, NO ONE ASKING
19:21:51  
TO SPEAK.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   ALL 

19:21:54 RIGHT, IN THAT CASE I'LL OPEN 
THE PUBLIC
19:21:57  HEARING AND MOVE ON 
TO OUR REGULAR AGENDA ITEMS.
WE
19:22:00  STILL I BELIEVE FORMALLY HAVE 
THREE
19:22:03  ITEMS ON THE AGENDA 
TONIGHT, IS THAT RIGHT JOEL
19:22:07 ?
>> Planner Pullen:   THAT'S 
CORRECT, WE DO HAVE THREE ITEMS 

19:22:10 ON THE AGENDA.
THE FIRST ONE OBVIOUSLY I'M 
GOING TO MENTION
19:22:13  HERE BRIEFLY.
WHAT DO YOU CALL IT THAT HAS
19:22:17  
BEEN CONTINUED.
BUT YES, THE THREE ITEMS ON
19:22:20  THE 
AGENDA TO ADDRESS.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   OKAY 

19:22:23 SO IF THAT ONE'S GOING TO BE 
CONTINUED THEN SHOULD WE MOVE
19:22:26  TO 
STAFF PRESENTATION ON THE SECOND 
ITEM
19:22:30 ?
19:22:33 
>> Planner Pullen:   LET ME GO 
AHEAD AND READ THE ITEM AND THEN 

19:22:36 WE'LL MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE 
NO CLARIFICATION
19:22:40 S, IT'S STILL ON 
THE AGENDA SO WE
19:22:43  DO NEED TO 
TREAT IT LIKE A REGULAR ITEM BUT 
I THINK
19:22:47  IT WILL BE FAIRLY 
STRAIGHTFORWARD TO JUST VOTE ON
19:22:49  
IT.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   YES.

19:22:52 >> JOEL YOU SAID IF THERE IS 
SOMEBODY TO SPEAK ON WHETHER IT 
WOULD BE
19:22:55  CONTINUED THAT WOULD BE 
THE ONLY POINT OF ISSUE.
19:22:56 
>> Planner Pullen:   FAIR 
ENOUGH.

19:23:02 SO CHAIR DAULTON I'LL GO AHEAD 
AND READ THE FIRST ITEM, IT IS

THANKS FOR KEEPING
19:25:20  US FILLED IN 
ON THE PROJECT.
I'M A RESIDENT
19:25:24  OF FREMONT FOR 
OVER 60 YEARS, I'M A PRODUCT
19:25:27  OF 
FREMONT UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT, 
I'M A RETIRED CARPENTER WHO 

19:25:30 BOUGHT A HOUSE HERE IN FREMONT 
31 YEARS AGO AS
19:25:33  A THIRD YEAR 
APPRENTICE.
WE USED TO BE
19:25:36  ABLE TO WORK HERE 
REGULARLY ON LOCAL
19:25:40  CONSTRUCTION 
PROJECTS BUT I'M SORRY TO SAY 
THAT CULTURE IS DEAD.
19:25:44 
IT PEOPLES LIKE WE'VE BEEN SOLD 
OUT TO DEVELOPMENT AND
19:25:47  NEED TO 
TURN THE BIGGEST PROFIT POSSIBLE 
BY
19:25:50  UNDERCUTTING WORKERS IN 
FREMONT
19:25:53 .
OUR CITY LEADERS FAILED TO
19:25:55  HOLD 
THEM ACCOUNTABLE.
YOU WOULD HAVE HAD A CHANCE ON 

19:25:59 THE 24th.
IS
19:26:02  THERE (INAUDIBLE) --
>> I'M SORRY TIM
19:26:06  THIS IS TRISH, 
YOUR VOICE IS -- YOUR VOICE
19:26:09  IS 
COMING IN AND OUT TIM, IF YOU 
COULD REPEAT THAT
19:26:13 ?

LETTING ME KNOW THAT
19:26:19 .
I'M AN INDUSTRY ADVISOR
19:26:22  TO THE 
MISSION VALLEY ROP HERE IN 
FREMONT.

19:26:25 THE CARPET
19:26:31  CARPENTERS UNION HAS A RIGHT
19:26:35 
RIGHT, RIGHT TO WORK UPON 
GRADUATION, TO USE
19:26:38  THOSE 
OPPORTUNITIES FOR OUR YOUTH HERE 
IN FREMONT AND HOW DO WE DO
19:26:41  
THAT?
BY PUTTING THOSE REQUIREMENTS 

19:26:45 INTO DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS.
ESPECIALLY
19:26:49  WHEN DEVELOPERS LIKE 
SKINEL
19:26:52 L DEVELOPERS ARE ASKING 
FOR BENEFITS.
NOT JUST TO DEVELOPERS IN
19:26:55  HIGH 
TECH BUSINESSES.
19:26:58 
SKINNEL HAS MADE NO COMMITMENT 
TO HIRING
19:27:02  LOCAL RESIDENTS, 
ENSURING CONTRACTORS PAY THE 
AREA
19:27:05  STANDARD WAGES AND 
PROVIDING HEALTH CARE BENEFITS 
IN
19:27:08  THESE (INAUDIBLE)
19:27:11  HERE IN 
FREMONT.
THIS PROJECT WILL BE A
19:27:15  COMPLETE 
FAILURE FOR THE LOCAL COMMUNITY 
AS WAS THE
19:27:19  OVERTON
19:27:22  MOORE PACIFIC 
COMMONS DEVELOPMENT HERE IN 
FREMONT
19:27:25 .
IT SUPPLIED PLENTY OF LOW PAID
19:27:28  
JOBS FOR WORKERS FROM THE
19:27:32  SOUTH 
BUT NONE FOR THE VALLEY.
THIS PROJECT
19:27:35  SHOULD BE REJECTED 
IF AND WHEN IT COMES UP
19:27:39  OR WHEN 
THE DEVELOPMENT TEAM CAN SIT 
DOWN
19:27:42  WITH THE LOCAL CARPENTERS, 
AND
19:27:45  MAKE REAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR 
LOCAL
19:27:49  APPRENTICES, PAY THE AREA
19:27:53  
STANDARD WAGES AND BENEFITS.
WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO PRODUCE
19:27:55  
THE NEXT GENERATION OF 
CONSTRUCTION WORKERS OR WE'RE 

19:27:58 GOING TO WATCH OR INFRASTRUCTURE 
CRUMBLE
19:28:01  IN THE U.S. DUE TO LACK 
OF TRAINED AND QUALIFIED 
EXPERIENCED
19:28:05  CONSTRUCTION 
WORKERS.
THE CITIZENS OF FREMONT ARE 

19:28:08 ASKING THE COMMISSION TO DO THE 
RIGHT THING ON BEHALF OF

CONSTRUCTION WORKERS IN FREMONT.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH

>> Commissioner Daulton:  
19:33:55  THANK

I BELIEVE WE CAN MOVE ON TO OUR 

19:33:58 NEXT ITEM ON THE AGENDA.
THE PAPE, AM I
19:34:02  SAYING THAT 
CORRECTLY, PAPE MACHINERY PYLON
19:34:05  
SIGNS UP.
>> Planner Pullen:   SO I'LL 

19:34:09 READ THE TITLE CHAIR.
THE PAPE MACHINERY PYLON
19:34:13  SIGN 
C.U.P. IS TO CONSIDER A 
CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT
19:34:16  TO 
INSTALL A
19:34:19 
FREEWAY-ORIENTED PYLON SIGN
ADJACENT TO INTERSTATE 680

19:34:22 LOCATED AT 43510 OSGOOD ROAD IN

19:34:25 THE IRVINGTON COMMUNITY PLAN
AREA, AND TO CONSIDER A FINDING
19:34:29 
OF CATEGORICAL EXEMPTION FROM
THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL
19:34:32 
QUALITY ACT (CEQA) PURSUANT TO
CEQA GUIDELINES SECTIONS 15311
19:34:37 
AND 15183.
AND TONIGHT THE
19:34:40  PROJECT PLANNER 
FOR THIS ITEM IS JAMES WILLIS 
AND HE'S
19:34:43  HERE AND AVAILABLE TO 
ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE 
COMMISSION.

19:34:46 THE APPLICANT IS ALSO HERE
19:34:49  AND 
GETS TEN MINUTES TO GIVE A 
PRESENTATION
19:34:53 .
FOLLOWED BY ORAL COMMUNICATION 
FROM THE PUBLIC, AT A
19:34:57  TIME LIMIT 
SPECIFIED BY THE CHAIR DEPENDING 
ON THE NUMBER
19:35:00  OF SPEAKERS, 
FOLLOWED BY A FIVE MINUTE 
REBUTTAL
19:35:03  FROM THE APPLICANT IF 
NECESSARY.
BACK TO YOU CHAIR.

19:35:10 >> Commissioner Daulton:   SO DO 
WE HAVE A STAFF PRESENTATION ON 
THIS
19:35:13  JOEL?
19:35:17 
>> Planner Pullen:   JAMES IS 
AVAILABLE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS 

19:35:20 AND HE ALSO HAS MATERIALS IF YOU 
WOULD LIKE TO SEE THEM.
>> Commissioner Daulton:  
19:35:23  ALL 
RIGHT, I WOULD ASK THE 
COMMISSIONERS IF THEY HAVE ANY 

19:35:27 QUESTIONS FOR STAFF.

19:35:30 ANYONE?
COMMISSIONER YEE, PLEASE.

19:35:35 >> Commissioner Yee:   YES, 
JAMES.
I'M JUST CURIOUS
19:35:38 , I JUST WANT TO 
DOUBLE CHECK WHO'S ACTUALLY
19:35:41  THE 
OWNER OF THAT LAND, WHERE THIS
19:35:45  
PROPOSED BILLBOARD SIGN IS GOING 
TO BE LOCATED
19:35:48 ?
>> PAPE OWNS THE ENTIRE LOT.
THEIR DEALERSHIP
19:35:52  IS CURRENTLY 
UNDER CONSTRUCTION.
AND THIS IS NOT
19:35:55  A BILLBOARD 
SIGN.
THIS IS A SIGN SPECIFICALLY TO
19:35:58  
ADVERTISE THE PAPE EQUIPMENT 
DEALERSHIP.

19:36:04 >> Commissioner Yee:   ALL 
RIGHT, THANK YOU.
>> Commissioner Daulton:  
19:36:08  
RECOGNIZE COMMISSIONER ZHANG.
>> Commissioner Zhang:   THANK 

19:36:11 YOU CHAIR.
I JUST LOOK AT THE GOOGLE MA'AM.
19:36:15  MAP.

19:36:18 IT SEEMS TO ME FROM THE 
INTERSECTION OF 6
19:36:21 80 TO MILPITAS 
OR SOMEWHERE, NEVER
19:36:24  KIND OF 
ADVERTISING SIGN ALONG THE 680.
IS
19:36:27  THAT THE CASE?
AT LEAST FOR ME, I HAVE
19:36:30  NEVER 
SEEN SUCH
19:36:33  SIGN IN THIS ROAD.

19:36:38 >> I'M NOT AWARE OF ANY OTHER 
PYLON SIGNS WITHIN FREMONT ON 6
19:36:42 
680 HOWEVER SEVERAL OTHER 
BUSINESSES ALONG THERE
19:36:46  HAVE 
LARGE SIGNS.

19:36:49 FOR EXAMPLE, THE FRY'S USED TO
19:36:52  
HAVE A SIGN.
THE REASON THIS IS A PYLON SIGN
19:36:55  
IS THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO PLACE A 
BUILDING VERY CLOSE
19:36:59  TO THE 
FREEWAY.
THERE ARE SEVERAL EASE
19:37:02 MENTS NEAR 
THEIR LOCATION, THIS IS A SMALL 
POCKET
19:37:05  WHERE THEY CAN FIT THIS 
SIGN TO GET SOME FREEWAY 
VISIBILITY
19:37:08  FOR THEIR DEALERSHIP.
19:37:11 
>> Commissioner Zhang:  
19:37:16  THE 
SIGN WILL BE VISIBLE BOTH 
DIRECTIONS
19:37:19 , NORTHBOUND AND 
SOUTHBOUND?
19:37:22 
>> YES, THE SITE IS
19:37:25  LOCATED SO 
IT CAN BE VISIBLE FROM THE 
FREEWAY
19:37:29 , ABOUT 13 FEET ABOVE THE 
GRADE AND THERE IS A
19:37:31  LARGE GROVE 
OF TREES TO THE NORTH OF THE 
SITE.

19:37:34 SO THE CARS WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO -- THE SOUTHBOUND TRAVELING 
CARS
19:37:38  WOULD ONLY BE ABLE TO SEE 
THE SIGN BRIEFLY BEFORE PASSING
19:37:41  
IT.
NORTHBOUND
19:37:44  HAS A HIGHER
19:37:48  CENTER 
DIVIDE IN THIS AREA.
SO THAT WOULD ALSO SERVE
19:37:51  TO 
BLOCK VIEWS OF IT AS WELL AS THE 
OVERPASS
19:37:55  UNTIL THEY GET CLOSER 
TO THE SIGN
19:37:58 .
>> Commissioner Zhang:   FINE, 
THANK YOU.

19:38:03 >> Commissioner Daulton:   ANY 
OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE 
COMMISSION?

19:38:06 ALL RIGHT, I GUESS I HAVE A 
QUESTION
19:38:11 .
LET'S SEE, SO WHAT
19:38:14  YOU'RE 
SAYING, JAMES, IS THAT THE
19:38:17  -- 
THAT THE NEXT CLOSEST SIGN TO 
THIS ONE IS
19:38:21  DOWN IN MILPITAS.
IS THAT RIGHT
19:38:24 ?
>> IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT PYLON 
SIGNS ON
19:38:27  680, I DON'T KNOW WHERE 
THERE'S ANOTHER
19:38:30  ONE WITHIN 
FREMONT ALONG 680.
THERE ARE
19:38:34  TWO LARGE FREEWAY 
ORIENTED PYLON SIGNS
19:38:37  ON 880 FOR 
EXAMPLE, THE PACIFIC COMMONS 
SIGN FOR
19:38:41  BLOCK WHICH IS OVER 115 
FEET TALL
19:38:44 .
AND THE AUTO MALL SIGN
19:38:47  IS OVER 
70 FEET TALL.
SO THIS
19:38:51  SIGN IS A PYLON SIGN ON 
680.
I'M NOT AWARE
19:38:54  OF ANY OTHERS.
HOWEVER OTHER BUSINESSES DID
19:38:57  
HAVE, TO AND DID HAVE BUILDING
19:39:00  
MOUNTED SIGNS THAT WERE ABOUT 
THE SAME SIZE AS THIS ONE.
19:39:03 
AS I SAID THE FRY'S SIGN WAS 
QUITE
19:39:07  LARGE AND APPROXIMATELY 
THE SAME HEIGHT BECAUSE IT WAS
19:39:10  
PLACED RELATIVELY HIGH ON THE 
FRY'S
19:39:13  BUILDING.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   AND 
CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT, JUST
19:39:16  
CLARIFY FOR MYSELF AND THE 
AUDIENCE, WHAT PART
19:39:19  OF THE 
MUNICIPAL CODE PUTS THIS ITEM
19:39:22  IN 
FRONT OF THE PLANNING 
COMMISSION?
19:39:25 
>> SO THE SIGN ORDINANCE HAS A 
SECTION THAT ALLOWS FOR
19:39:28  FREEWAY 
ORIENTED SIGNS
19:39:33  IN THE INDUSTRIAL 
DISTRICTS.
AND IT'S SPECIFIED
19:39:36  AS REQUIRING 
A CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT
19:39:39 .
>> Commissioner Daulton:  
19:39:43  OKAY.
AND ARE THERE ANY ISSUES OF 
THE -- ON THE
19:39:46  VIEW SCAPE FROM 
THE HILLSIDE THAT ARE
19:39:51  PERTINENT 
TO THIS?
WHEN I WAS OVER THERE I NOTICED 

19:39:54 THERE ARE SOME HOMES UP THE HILL 
THAT ARE DEFINITELY GOING TO SEE
19:39:58  
THIS, AND THEY'VE BEEN THERE FOR 
A LONG TIME.
19:40:01 
I REALIZE NOBODY OWNS THE VIEW 
BUT IS THAT ANY
19:40:05  KIND OF 
CONSIDERATION HERE?
>> THE SIGN WOULD BE EDGE
19:40:08 -ON TO 
WHERE MOST OF THOSE HOMES ARE 
LOCATED
19:40:11 .
THEY WOULD BE LOOKING AT THE 
SIDE OF THE SIGN
19:40:15  WHICH ISN'T 
VERY WIDE AT ALL AND THE 
ILLUMINATION IS FACING
19:40:18  THE 
FREEWAY RATHER THAN TOWARDS THE 
HOMES AND
19:40:21  IT IS ACTUALLY A 
RELATIVELY LOW ILLUMINATION.
19:40:25 
IT IS INTERNALLY ILLUMINATED AND
19:40:28  
THERE ARE NO BARE BULBS OR 
ANYTHING,
19:40:32  NOTHING FLASHING AND 
IT IS BASICALLY JUST A LARGE 
SIGN
19:40:35  THAT IS INTERNALLY 
ILLUMINATED LIKE DOZENS OF
19:40:39  OTHER 
SIGNS IN FREMONT, IN THIS CASE 
IT HAPPENS TO BE NEXT TO THE
19:40:41  
FREEWAY.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   I 

19:40:44 UPS.
THANK YOU.
IF THERE ARE NO OTHER QUESTIONS 

19:40:47 FROM THE COMMISSIONERS, I GUESS 
WE
19:40:51  CAN -- WHAT, ENTERTAIN A 
MOTION
19:40:54  AT THIS POINT OR --
19:40:57 
>> Planner Pullen:   AT THIS 
POINT CHAIR, WE'VE HAD THE 

19:41:02 PRESENTATION FROM THE PLANNER.
AND IT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE TO 
GIVE THE
19:41:05  APPLICANT --
>> Commissioner Daulton:   OKAY.
>> Planner Pullen:  
19:41:09  -- TEN 
MINUTES TO SPEAK AND THEN GO TO 
THE PUBLIC
19:41:12  AND BACK TO THE 
APPLICANT
19:41:15 .
THEY GET FIVE MINUTES AT THE 
END.

19:41:18 THEY DON'T NEED TO TAKE THE FIVE 
MINUTES, THEY MAY DEFER
19:41:22  BUT WE 
WANT
19:41:26  EVERYBODY TO HAVE A CHANCE 
TO SPEAK.
19:41:29 
>> Commissioner Daulton:   I 
APOLOGIZE JOEL, I PROMISE
19:41:32  I'LL 
GET THE HANG OF IT.
PRESENTATION
19:41:36  FROM THE APPLICANT, 
ANYTHING, DO WE HAVE A 
PRESENTATION?
19:41:39 
NO?
>> I'M KELLY REED,
19:41:42  I'M WITH 
RANGE
19:41:46  SIGNS.
MIKE AND I INITIATED THIS 
PROCESS WITH
19:41:49  MR. WILLIS IN 2017.
19:41:54 
AND HAVE SINCE THEN
19:41:57  BEEN 
CHECKING THE BOXES
19:42:00  AS WE WENT IN 
FOR EACH
19:42:03  AND EVERYTHING THAT 
WE'VE BEEN ASKED TO PROVIDE
19:42:08 .
AND I -- NOW THAT
19:42:11  MIKE IS, 
MR. PATI IS
19:42:14  UNMUTED I WILL TURN 
THE FLOOR OVER
19:42:17  TO HIM.
HE -- I THINK HE HAS MORE TO
19:42:20  
SAY.
>> FORGIVE ME,
19:42:23  I HOPE MUCH HAS 
SEEN THE
19:42:26  MATERIALS WE'VE TURNED 
IN THROUGH JAMES WILLIS TO
19:42:29  SHOW 
WHAT HE DESCRIBED IN NARRATIVE 
FORMAT.

19:42:32 BUT AS MENTIONED EARLIER OUR 
DEALERSHIP
19:42:35  IS UNDER 
CONSTRUCTION.
AND VERY EARLY ON, WHEN WE
19:42:38  WENT 
THROUGH THIS PROCESS WITH CELY, 
I REMEMBER
19:42:41  MEETING ONSITE WE 
TALKED ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE
19:42:45  OF 
MARKETING OUR BRAND TO THE FREE 
WAY TO
19:42:48  ATTRACT TRAFFIC MAINLY ON 
THE RENTAL SIDE OF OUR BUSINESS.
SO
19:42:51  WE APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY 
FOR -- TO LOOK AT THIS WITH YOU.
IF
19:42:54  THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS WE 
CAN ANSWER WITH RESPECT TO THE 
PACKAGE WE
19:42:58  WOULD BE MORE THAN 
HAPPY TO DO SO
19:43:01  OR WITH RESPECT 
TO THE
19:43:05  DEVELOPMENT IN GENERAL.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   DO I 
HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FROM
19:43:09  THE 
COMMISSIONER -- OR I SEE A HAND 
RAISED OVER THERE
19:43:12 .
IS THIS CHER
19:43:17 I FLETCHER,
19:43:20  ARE YOU 
PART OF THE GROUP?
>> YES, SHE IS
19:43:23 .
>> Commissioner Daulton:   
PLEASE RECOGNIZE CHER
19:43:27 I 
FLETCHER-POWELL.
I THINK YOU'RE MUTE
19:43:30 ED CURRENTLY.

19:43:33 >> THANK YOU.
SORRY, I THOUGHT SOMEBODY ELSE 
WAS GOING TO UN
19:43:36 MUTE ME.
I'M THE APPLICANT.
19:43:39 
ON BASIS OF RECOMMENDATION FOR 
PAPE
19:43:44 .
PRIMARILY I PUT TOGETHER ALL THE 
DOCUMENTS BASED OFTEN
19:43:47  THE 
INFORMATION THAT I WAS PROVIDED.
I THINK
19:43:51  THAT KELLY AND I HAVE 
BEEN TALKING A LITTLE BIT
19:43:54  ABOUT 
TODAY ABOUT THE FRP
19:43:58  PROSPECT OF 
GETTING THIS SIGN.
AND IT SEEMS LIKE
19:44:02  THE PLANNING 
SIDE OF THIS WOULD ALLOW FOR US 
TO HAVE A LARGER
19:44:05  SIGN, MUCH, 
MUCH TALLER
19:44:09  AND MUCH, MUCH 
LARGER
19:44:11  THAN WE'RE ACTUALLY 
PROPOSING.
WE KIND OF COME AGAIN UNDER WHAT 

19:44:14 WOULD BE ALLOWED FOR US TO HAVE 
SOME VISIBILITY
19:44:17  FOR THIS 
DEALERSHIP ALONG
19:44:22  I-680.
THE ONLY
19:44:25  OTHER VISIBILITY WE 
WOULD GET IS FROM OSGOOD
19:44:30  ROAD.
THIS IS A DEALERSHIP THAT TRIES 
TO ATTRACT THIS TYPE
19:44:33  OF PERSON 
DRIVING UP AND DOWN I-6
19:44:37 80.
MAY NOT BE ON OSGOOD IF THEY 
DIDN'T
19:44:40  KNOW THAT THIS DEALERSHIP 
WAS THERE AND THE ONLY WAY 
THEY'RE GOING TO
19:44:43  SEE IT IS IF 
THEY HAVE GOT THIS PYLON
19:44:47  SIGN 
OUT ON THE FREEWAY.
40 FEET
19:44:50  TALL SIGN IS NOT AN 
EXTREMELY LARGE OR
19:44:53  VERY TALL 
SIGN, CONSIDERING THE GRADE
19:44:56  THAT 
THEY'VE GOT AT THIS SITE, VERSUS
19:45:00  
THE GRADE ELEVATION OF I-6
19:45:03 80.
19:45:07 
WE'VE GOT SOME OTHER CHALLENGES 
THERE OBVIOUSLY WITH THE HIGH 

19:45:10 TENSION POWER LINES WHICH WE 
NEED TO AVOID BUT AGAIN
19:45:14 , THIS 
WOULD ALLOW US TO HAVE SOME
19:45:17  
VISIBILITY ON I-680 WHICH WOULD 
BE
19:45:20  VERY IMPORTANT TO THE SUCCESS 
OF THE DEALERSHIP
19:45:23 .
>> Commissioner Daulton:   ALL 
RIGHT.

19:45:26 IS THAT IT FROM THE APPLICANT 
THEN
19:45:30 ?
>> I THINK THAT'S IT FOR ME.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   YOU 

19:45:33 STILL HAVE A COUPLE OF MINUTES 
IF YOU LIKE, OTHERWISE I'M GOING 
TO GO
19:45:36  BACK TO THE COMMISSIONERS 
FOR QUESTIONS TO THE APPLICANTS
19:45:41 .
I GUESS I WILL DO THAT.
DO I HAVE ANY QUESTIONS
19:45:44  FROM THE 
COMMISSIONERS TO THE
19:45:47  APPLICANTS?

19:45:50 COMMISSIONER YEE, YES.
19:45:56 
YOU'RE MUTED B
19:45:59  BEN.
>> Commissioner Yee:   YES, THIS 
IS COMMISSIONER YEE
19:46:02  SO THAT OUR 
SECRETARY WOULD KNOW WHO IS 
SPEAKING
19:46:06 .
BUT I HAVE A QUESTION REGARDS
19:46:09  
TO, YOU KNOW, TO THIS SIGN.
IS IT POSSIBLE TO
19:46:12  PUT SOMETHING 
SIMILAR THAT WE COULD SEE LIKE 
IT
19:46:15  WAS DONE AT FRY'S OR MAYBE 
LIKE AT
19:46:18  METRO CROSSING LIKE A 
LARGE BANNER THAT IS ON
19:46:21  YOUR 
BUILDING TO BE ACTUALLY SEEN 
FROM THE FREEWAY IN LIEU
19:46:24  OF A 40 
FOOT TALL SIGN
19:46:28  THAT'S 
PERPENDICULAR TO THE FREEWAY?

19:46:34 >> FOR US IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT, 
THIS IS
19:46:37  MIKE PATI WITH PAPE.
SORRY ABOUT
19:46:40  THAT.
FIRST THAT WOULD BE DIFFICULT 
FOR A COUPLE OF REASONS
19:46:44 .
FIRST, AS CHERI ALLUDED
19:46:47  TO, THE 
VISIBILITY
19:46:50  FROM THE FREEWAY.
TRAFFIC HAD A MAY BE SERVED BY 
US TO KNOW
19:46:53  WHERE WE ARE.
19:46:56 
AS MENTIONED THE FACILITY, THERE 
IS A GROVE OF TREES TO THE NORTH
19:47:00  
AND THEN APPROACHING TO THE 
SOUTH PAST
19:47:03  THE INTERSECTION FROM 
AUTO MALL.
THE SITE ISN'T
19:47:06  NECESSARILY 
VISIBLE IN ADVANCE UNTIL YOU ARE 
ON TOP OF IT
19:47:09  ON THE FREEWAY AND 
AS YOU'RE DRIVING BY
19:47:12 , PEOPLE ARE 
NOT GOING TO NECESSARILY LOOK 
INTO THE DEPTHS
19:47:16  OF THE PROPERTY, 
THEY ARE MORE FOCUSED ON
19:47:19  A SIGN 
THAT IS FREEWAY FRONTAGE.
THE OTHER ASPECT
19:47:22  IS, THERE ARE 
FUNCTIONALITY BUILT IN
19:47:25  THERE, 
MACHINES COMING OUT OF VARIOUS 
SERVICE BAY
19:47:29 S, SO WORK AROUND 
THAT FUNCTIONALITY, HAVING
19:47:32  THAT 
SIGN POTENTIALLY BLOCKED
19:47:35  BY 
MACHINE TRAFFIC IS A DISABILITY.
19:47:40 
DISADVANTAGEOUS FOR US TO HAVE 
IT LOCATED FAR FROM THE FREEWAY 

19:47:43 AND ON THE BUILDING.
>> Commissioner Yee:   ALL 
RIGHT, THANK YOU
19:47:47 .
>> IF I MAY.
THIS IS
19:47:50  A BUSINESS THAT HAS
19:47:53  200 
LOCATIONS ON
19:47:56  -- UP AND DOWN THE 
85
19:48:00  
I-5 CORRIDOR.
AND WHAT THEY STAND
19:48:03  FOR IS 
19:48:06  IS 
QUALITY AND INTEGRITY.
THEY ARE
19:48:09  VERY SOLID.
THEY KEEP MOVING
19:48:12  FROM BUYING 
PARTS FOR YOUR EQUIPMENT TO 
GETTING BIG
19:48:15  EQUIPMENT.
AND TO REPRESENT THEIR
19:48:18  BRAND 
WITH A BANNER
19:48:22  WOULD NOT ONLY BE 
NOT A LONG TERM SOLUTION
19:48:25  FOR 
SOMEONE WHO'S COMMITTED TO THE 
COMMUNITY
19:48:29 , AND I DON'T MEAN
19:48:32  TO 
COMPARE, I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE
19:48:36  
AVERAGE REVENUE
19:48:39  BUSINESS BRINGS 
BUT THIS IS A BUSINESS THAT FROM 
THE TIME WE MET
19:48:43  IN 2017 THERE 
WAS GREAT INTEREST IN HAVING 
THEM HAVE
19:48:46  A PRESENCE IN FREMONT.
BECAUSE OF THE SALES REVENUE
19:48:49  
THAT THEY WOULD BRING TO THE 
COMMUNITY.
19:48:53 
SO IN REPRESENTING
19:48:57  PAPE, THE 
IMAGE THAT THEY NEED TO MAINTAIN
19:49:00  
IS THE IMAGE THEY'VE GOT FROM 
CANADA TO
19:49:03  MEXICO WHICH IS WE'RE 
HERE TODAY WE'RE GOING TO BE 
HERE
19:49:06  TOMORROW AND NOT A BANNER 
THAT MAY SUGGEST
19:49:09  WE'RE HERE 
UNTIL THE WIND BLOWS THIS
19:49:12  BANNER 
DOWN AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO BE 
SOMEWHERE ELSE.

19:49:21 >> Commissioner Daulton:   
COMPLE DOES THAT ANSWER YOUR 
QUESTION?

19:49:24 >> Commissioner Yee:   YES, IT 
DOES.
NOW I'M GOING TO ASK
19:49:27  ANOTHER 
QUESTION OF THE APPLICANT.
AS YOU WELL KNOW MANY BUSINESS
19:49:31 ES 
UTILIZE SOCIAL MEDIA AS A WAY 
FOR THEIR CUSTOMERS
19:49:34  TO BE ABLE 
TO FIND THEM
19:49:37 .
AND, YOU KNOW, I KNOW LIKE FOR 
MYSELF
19:49:40 , YOU KNOW, EVERYONE ALSO 
A SMARTPHONE, AND
19:49:44  THEY TYPE IN 
THE ADDRESS.
19:49:47 
SO I MYSELF I'M ONLY SPEAKING
19:49:50  
FOR MYSELF, I DON'T KNOW IF A 
SIGN REALLY IS GOING
19:49:53  TO HELP ME 
BECAUSE I'M ACTUALLY LOOKING AT 
MY PHONE
19:49:57 , IT'S GIVING ME TURN BY 
TURN, TELLING ME EXACTLY HOW
19:50:00  TO 
GET TO YOUR PAPE DEALERSHIP.
19:50:03 
YOU KNOW, TALKING TO SOME OF THE 
BUSINESSES THAT ARE IN THE AREA
19:50:06 , 
THEY THOUGHT PROBABLY THE SAME 
WAY
19:50:09  -- NO, THEY THOUGHT THE SAME 
WAY AS WELL.
THAT MOST
19:50:13  PEOPLE WOULD BE USING 
THEIR GPS TRACK
19:50:16 ING IN ORDER TO 
FIND YOUR DEALERSHIP.

19:50:19 AND SO
19:50:25  I DON'T KNOW, YOU KNOW, I 
GUESS I'M KIND OF WONDERING IN 
TERMS OF THE
19:50:29  DATA, IF HAVING A 
SIGN IS GOING TO MAKE THAT MUCH 
OF A DIFFERENCE.

19:50:37 >> SORRY, KELLY REID
19:50:40 , THAT IS A 
BIGGER CONVERSATION THAN I'M
19:50:43  
PREPARED TO HAVE.
I DIDN'T PUT TOGETHER 

19:50:46 INFORMATION ON IMPRESSIONS PER
19:50:49  
AUTOMOBILE, SO THAT I COULD SAY, 
YOU KNOW, ON
19:50:53  THAT, GIVEN THE 
TRAFFIC COUNT
19:50:56 , WHAT THEY COULD 
COUNT ON AS ADVERTISING
19:51:00  THAT 
WOULD NOT ONLY TELL PEOPLE IF 
THEY'RE LOOKING FOR IT,
19:51:03  WHERE 
THEY'RE AT BUT WOULD TELL PEOPLE 
WHEN THEY GO BY
19:51:06 , OH, THAT'S 
RIGHT, I NEED TO GO PICK UP SOME 
PARTS
19:51:09  FOR THE CONSTRUCTION 
COMPANY
19:51:12  TOMORROW, THAT'S WHERE 
THEY'RE AT, GREAT I
19:51:16  CAN BE BACK 
THERE.
SO IT SERVES AS
19:51:19  AN ADVERTISEMENT 
TO NOT ONLY THE PEOPLE WHO ARE 
LOOKING FOR IT
19:51:23 , BUT TO REMIND 
PEOPLE THAT
19:51:26  THEY'RE GOING TO 
BECOME A PART OF THE COMMUNITY
19:51:30 .
19:51:39 
>> Commissioner Daulton:   ALL 
RIGHT, COMMISSIONER ZHANG
19:51:41 .
>> Commissioner Zhang:   I HAVE 
A SIMILAR CONCERN ABOUT THE 

19:51:45 EFFECTIVENESS OF THE SIGN.
BECAUSE ON THE ONE SIDE YOU HAVE 
TREES,
19:51:48  YOUR SIGN WON'T BE TALLER 
19:51:52  
THAN THAT.
ON THE OTHER SIDE YOU HAVE A
19:51:55  
SEVEN POWER TOWER OVER THERE.
THE PASSENGER
19:51:58  PASSED BY THAT 
PART,
19:52:01  PROBABLY ONLY CAN SEE YOUR 
SIGN FOR ONE SECOND, PROBABLY
19:52:06 .
I JUST -- IT'S DIFFICULT TO
19:52:09  ME 
TO JUSTIFY THE VALUE ADDED.
19:52:13 
PLUS YOU WILL BE THE FIRST SIGH 
SETTING
19:52:16  OVER THERE.
IT BECOME AN EYESORE
19:52:20  FOR THE 
LOAD
19:52:23  IF I DROP BY.
THAT'S MY
19:52:25  THOUGHT.
YOU KNOW.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   DO 

19:52:29 YOU HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE 
APPLICANT?
19:52:32 
>> Commissioner Zhang:   NO, I 
JUST FEEL THAT THE
19:52:35  EFFECTIVENESS 
OF THIS SIGN IS KIND OF NOT -- 
IS NOT JUSTIFIED
19:52:39 .
>> Commissioner Daulton:   OKAY, 
WHEN WE COME BACK ON DISCUSSION
19:52:43 , 
COMMISSIONER ZHANG, THANK YOU.
19:52:45 
>> Planner Pullen:   CHAIR.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   YES 

19:52:48 JOEL.
>> Planner Pullen:   IF IT'S 
HELPFUL, A COUPLE OF
19:52:51  THINGS I 
WANT TO OFFER.
ONE, JAMES WILLIS
19:52:55  THE PLANNER 
DOES HAVE SOME GRAPHICS, IF
19:52:58  IT'S 
HELPFUL AT SOME POINT DURING 
YOUR DISCUSSION TO VISUALIZE
19:53:02  THE 
SITE.
IF THAT'S SOMETHING YOU WANT
19:53:05  TO 
DELVE INTO.
AND THEN, ONE OF THE
19:53:08  THINGS I 
WANT TO MAKE SURE DURING THE
19:53:12  
STAFF PRESENTATION WE KIND OF 
HIGHLIGHTED SOME OF THE MOORNL
19:53:15  
P
19:53:19  MAJOR 
POINTS.
ALSO, THE
19:53:22  CODE CONTEMPLATES 
SIGNS OF THIS TYPE IN
19:53:25  THIS TYPE 
OF LOCATION AND IT DOES SEND IT
19:53:28  
TO YOU FOR DISCRETION OVER
19:53:32  
HEIGHT AND LOCATION, ET CETERA.
THE INTENTION OF A SIGN
19:53:36  FOR A 
USE LIKE THIS IS OBVIOUSLY, PAPE 
IS A
19:53:40  MAJOR
19:53:44  KIND OF NEW BUSINESS 
TO FREMONT AND CONTRIBUTE
19:53:47  TO 
FREMONT WITH SALES AND RENTAL OF 
THESE PIECES OF EQUIPMENT
19:53:50 .
I'M SURE THEY DO KNOW THEIR 
BUSINESS IN TERMS
19:53:53  OF HOW TO 
ADVERTISE.
IT'S A FINE LINE WE'RE GET
19:53:56 TING 
INTO SORT OF THE NEED FOR THE 
SIGN AND THE BENEFIT OF THE SIGN
19:53:59  
AND THAT'S ALL THEIR TERRITORY
19:54:03 .
AT SOME POINT IT COMES BACK TO 
THE ZONING
19:54:06  QUESTION OF, IS IT ON 
BALANCE, SOMETHING
19:54:09  THAT WE 
SHOULD ALLOW AND I JUST WANT TO 
KEEP IN MIND
19:54:12  THAT THERE IS AN 
ASSUMPTION
19:54:15  IN THE ZONING CODE 
THAT THERE IS AN ECONOMIC 
BENEFIT TO
19:54:18  THESE SIGNS AND 
THAT'S WHY THEY'RE BEING
19:54:22  ALLOWED 
BOTH FOR THE APPLICANT AND FOR 
THE CITY'S COMMERCE AS A
19:54:25  WHOLE.
SO AGAIN, JAMES IS AVAILABLE 
WITH GRAPHICS
19:54:28  IF YOU NEED.
AND I'LL GO BACK
19:54:31  TO YOU.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   THANK 
YOU, JOEL
19:54:35 .
COMMISSIONER LIU DO YOU HAVE A 
QUESTION FOR THE APPLICANT?
19:54:37 
>> Commissioner Liu:   YES, I 
DO.

19:54:40 WHAT IS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN 
PAPE
19:54:43  AND JOHN DEER
19:54:47 ?
>> COMMISSIONER, THIS IS MIKE 
PATI
19:54:50 .
WE ARE A DEALERSHIP FOR
19:54:54  JOHN 
DEERE.
JOHN DEER IS
19:54:57  THE MANUFACTURER 
AND WE SELL THEIR PRODUCTS IN I
19:55:01  
BELIEVE NINE WESTERN STATES NOW.
>> Commissioner Liu:   OKAY.
19:55:04 
AT SOME POINT I HEARD IT FROM 
THE NEIGHBOR THAT YOU ATTEMPTED 

19:55:07 TO PLACE THE SIGN ON THE 
ADJACENT PROPERTY
19:55:11 .
AT CRIPS I
19:55:14  HEARD.
AND WHY IS THAT?
19:55:17 
OR IS THAT TRUE?
I DON'T KNOW I JUST HEARD IT 

19:55:20 FROM -- BY TALKING TO THE 
NEIGHBORS.
19:55:23 
>> COMMISSIONER LIU THAT'S NOT 
TRUE TO MY MANY.

19:55:26 THAT'S NOT SOMETHING I'VE BEEN 
INVOLVED IN AND LIKE KELLY
19:55:30  SAID 
WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THIS 
PROJECT
19:55:33  WITH THE CITY OF FREMONT 
FOR NEARLY FIVE YEARS.
>> Commissioner Liu:   OKAY, 

19:55:37 MAYBE THE PERSON MISSPOKE AND 
THAT'S WHY I'M ASKING
19:55:40  THE 
CLARIFYING QUESTION.
SO
19:55:43  OKAY, SO THAT'S THE QUESTION 
I HAVE FOR YOU GUYS SO FAR
19:55:46 .
>> THANK YOU
19:55:48 .
>> Commissioner Daulton:   THANK 
YOU, COMMISSIONER LIU.

19:55:51 IF THERE'S NO FURTHER QUESTIONS, 
I'D LIKE TO
19:55:54  BRING THE 
COMMISSIONERS BACK TO STAFF
19:55:57  OR 
DO WE GIVE SOME TIME TO THE 
APPLICANT TO MAKE
19:56:00  A FINAL 
STATEMENT?
>> Planner Pullen:   WE
19:56:04  HAVEN'T 
CHECKED YET IF THERE'S ANYBODY 
FROM THE PUBLIC THAT WANTS TO 

19:56:07 SPEAK.
I DIDN'T SEE HANDS RAISED A 
MOMENT AGO.
19:56:10 
WE SHOULD CHECK.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   TRISH 

19:56:13 DO YOU HAVE ANY SPEAKERS ON THIS 
ITEM?
19:56:17 
>> CHAIR DAULTON I'M LOOKING NOW 
AND I DO NOT SEE ANY RAISED 

19:56:20 HANDS SO WE DO NOT HAVE ANY 
SPEAKERS.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   OKAY,
19:56:23  
SO THEN LET'S BRING QUESTIONS 
BACK TO STAFF ON THIS IF WE
19:56:26  
COULD.
19:56:34 
I'D LIKE TO SEE IF THERE'S 
ANYBODY HAS FURTHER QUESTIONS 

19:56:37 FOR THE STAFF ON THIS.
OR ANY DISCUSSION
19:56:40  ON THIS ITEM 
FROM THE COMMISSION
19:56:44 .
19:56:55 
>> Commissioner Liu:   I WANT TO 
BE RECOGNIZED.
19:56:57 
>> Commissioner Daulton:   GO 
AHEAD.

19:57:00 CA>> Commissioner Liu:   I
19:57:03  HAVE 
QUESTIONS FOR THE STAFF.
FROM WHAT I SAW IN THE PACKAGE 

19:57:07 THE SIGN APPEARS TO BE VERY 
STRIKING, VERY
19:57:10  
ATTENTION-GRABBING.
ARE THERE ANY
19:57:14  STUDIES FROM THE 
SAFETY PERSPECTIVE FOR THOSE 
DRIVERS
19:57:17  WHO ARE KIND OF MAKING A 
TURN FROM HIGHWAY 6
19:57:21 80 GOING 
DRIVING SOUTH
19:57:24 ?
>> FIRST OF ALL, I'D ARGUE THAT
19:57:27  
IT IS ACTUALLY A RELATIVELY 
BLAND SIGN WHEN YOU THINK
19:57:30  ABOUT 
HOW A LOT OF THE MONUMENT SIGNS 
AND OUTER FREEWAY
19:57:35  ORIENTED SIGNS 
EVEN IN FREMONT APPEAR
19:57:38 .
FOR EXAMPLE, THE
19:57:41  AUTO MALL SIGN 
HAS A DIGITAL BILLBOARD ON IT
19:57:44 .
AND THE
19:57:48  PACIFIC COMMONS SIGN.
AND THIS
19:57:51  SIGN IS NOT NO GRAPHICS
19:57:55 
GRAPHICS, NO THINGS MOVING 
AROUND, OR ANYTHING
19:57:58  LIKE THAT AT 
THE TIME BE A STATICAL SIGN.
19:58:01 
THE PROCT KNOWLEDGE WAS SHARED 
WITH CALTRANS AS
19:58:05  PART OF THE 
NORMAL PROCESS OF REVIEW AND 
CALTRANS HAD
19:58:08  NO COMMENT ON THE 
SIGN SO THEY DID
19:58:11  SEEM TO THINK 
THAT IT WAS A SAFETY CONCERN
19:58:15 .
>> THIS IS CLIFF NGUYEN.
19:58:18 
COMMISSIONER LIU AS I COULD ADD 
TO WHAT JAMES JUST MENTION
19:58:21 ED, 
YOU AS THE COMMISSION CAN IF YOU 
DECIDE TO ALLOW
19:58:24  THE APPLICANT TO 
PROCEED AND BUILD THIS SIGN, IS 
TO
19:58:28  ADD CONDITIONS, WHERE THERE 
ARE ADVERSE IMPACTS
19:58:31  SUCH AS THE 
CONCERNS YOU HAVE, COMMISSIONER 
LIU
19:58:35 , GLARE, THE LIGHTING, 
ET CETERA,
19:58:38  ON MOTORISTS THAT ARE 
TRAVELING THROUGH 680
19:58:41 , THOSE 
CONDITIONS COULD BE ADDED.
AND IF IT'S
19:58:44  -- IF WE DO FIND 
THAT IT'S WARRANTED, TO
19:58:48  MAKE 
SOME CHANGES AND ADJUSTMENTS, IF 
THE SIGN
19:58:51  IS APPROVED BY THE 
COMMISSION, THEN WE HAVE
19:58:54  THAT 
AUTHORITY AS APPROVED BY THE 
COMMISSION IF YOU DECIDE TO
19:58:57  
APPROVE THE SIGN.
YOU KNOW, WHAT
19:59:00  WE'VE BEEN HEARD 
FROM PAPE AND PAPE IS A VERY
19:59:04  
LARGE TAX REVENUE GENERATOR THEY 
SELL HEAVY
19:59:07  EQUIPMENT, THEY ARE 
AN AUTHORIZED JOHN DEERE
19:59:11  
SUPPLIER AND SELL THEIR 
TRACTORS.

19:59:14 THIS IS PART OF THEIR BUSINESS 
MODEL AND THIS IS A FLAGSHIP
19:59:17  
BUILDING.
THEY'RE BUILDING IT FROM GROUND 

19:59:20 UP.
AND THIS IS THE ONLY ONE I 
BELIEVE
19:59:23  IN THE BAY AREA.
AND SO THE DESIGN
19:59:26  OF THE 
BUILDING IS VERY
19:59:30  CONTEMPORARY.
19:59:33 
LOOKS VERY GOOD.
OVERALL THE QUALITY, THIS IS
19:59:36  
WHAT STAFF BELIEVES, IT IS OF 
GOOD QUALITY, THEY
19:59:39  HAVE A 
QUALIFIED SIGN CONSULTANT.
YOU SEE RIGHT HERE
19:59:43 .
BUT THOSE ISSUES ARE VALID,
19:59:45  AND 
CAN BE ADDRESSED THROUGH 
CONDITIONS OF APPROVAL.

19:59:52 THANK YOU.
>> Planner Pullen:   TO ADD ON 
TO WHAT CLIFF
19:59:56  SAID JUST REAL 
BRIEFLY, COMMISSIONER LIU ASKED
19:59:59  
ABOUT CALTRANS STANDARDS AND THE 
STANDARDS THAT I'M AWARE OF THAT 

20:00:02 CALTRANS DOES HAVE FOR SIGNS
20:00:04  
RELATES TO DWELL TIME FOR 
CHANGING IMAGES.

20:00:07 SO WHEN YOU GO ON 880 FOR 
EXAMPLE WHEN CALTRANS WOULD
20:00:11  GET 
INVOLVED IN THE QUESTION ABOUT A 
SIGN THERE, THEY WOULDN'T WANT
20:00:14  
THOSE IMAGES TO CHANGE TOO SOON.
SO THAT PEOPLE
20:00:17  ARE, YOU KNOW, 
LOOKING VERY FREQUENTLY AT 
MODIFIED
20:00:21  SIGNS.
IT WOULD REDUCE ROADWAY SAFETY.
20:00:24 
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO STATIC 
SIGNS, ON
20:00:27  THIS FRONTAGE, THERE'S 
NO SUCH -- THERE'S NO CONCERN
20:00:30  
ABOUT A SIGN OF THIS TYPE.
20:00:33 
>> YES, THE SIGN IS INTERNALLY 
LIT,
20:00:37  IT'S NOT LIKE IT'S A 
DIGITAL BOARD OR ANYTHING LIKE 
THAT
20:00:40 .
>> Commissioner Liu:   OKAY, 
THANK YOU.

20:00:44 >> Commissioner Daulton:   ANY 
OTHER QUESTIONS FOR STAFF FROM 
THE COMMISSIONERS?

20:00:49 ALL RIGHT, IN THAT CASE WE CAN 
HAVE SOME DISCUSSION
20:00:52  HERE.
I'D LIKE TO TELL
20:00:55  MY FELLOW 
COMMISSIONERS THAT, YOU KNOW, IF 
WE
20:00:59  HAVE, AS A COMMISSION, 
DISCRETIONARY
20:01:03  ABILITY TO SAY YEA 
OR NAY ON THIS
20:01:06  PROJECT, I DON'T 
THINK WE SHOULD ALLOW THIS
20:01:11  SIGN 
TO BE THE ONLY SIGN IN FREMONT
20:01:14  
ON 680.
THIS IS A PRECEDENT
20:01:17 -SETTING 
THING FOR US HERE.
I
20:01:21  APPRECIATE THE REVENUE STREAM 
THAT THIS COMPANY IS GOING TO 
BRING IN
20:01:25 .
BUT OUR CITY SIGN IS
20:01:28  THE HILLS 
HERE.
AND IF YOU WANT
20:01:31  OUR HILLS TO BE 
VIEWED WITH THIS
20:01:35  -- WITH THIS 
PARTICULAR SIGN AND THEN MAYBE 
MORE SIGNS
20:01:38  TO COME, I DON'T SEE 
IT
20:01:41  THAT WAY.
SO IF WE HAVE A DISCRETION TO 
TURN
20:01:45  THIS, TO DENY THIS 
APPLICATION I WOULD VOTE IN THAT 
REGARD
20:01:50 .
ANY
20:01:52  OTHER COMMENTS FROM THE 
COMMISSION?
>> Commissioner Steckler:   I 

20:01:56 HAVE A QUESTION OR A COMMENT.
THIS IS CRAIG.
20:01:57 
>> Commissioner Daulton:   
COMMISSIONER.

20:02:00 >> Commissioner Steckler:   
ISN'T THERE A LARGE SIGN AT 
McDONALD'S AT
20:02:03  680 AND MISSION?

20:02:08 SEE -- YOU CAN SEE FROM THE 
FREEWAY BOTH DIRECTIONS
20:02:10 ?
>> I BELIEVE SO.
>> Commissioner Steckler:   AND 

20:02:14 I BELIEVE THAT ISN'T THERE A 
LARGE GAS
20:02:17  STATION SIGN AT
20:02:20  AUTO 
MALL AND 680,
20:02:24  AT THE -- IT WOULD 
BE THE SOUTHEAST
20:02:27  CORNER, A LARGE 
SIGN IS
20:02:30  IT AN ARCO STATION 
MAYBE?
20:02:34 
WHAT I'M TRYING TO POINT OUT IS 
THIS IS NOT THE ONLY SIGN ON 6
20:02:37 
680.

20:02:47 >> JOEL DO YOU HAVE --
>> Planner Pullen:   THE 
McDONALD'S SIGN
20:02:50  I RECALL THERE 
IS A BIG TREE THEY PUT UP AND
20:02:53  I 
BELIEVE IT IS IN THE VICINITY OF
20:02:56  
THAT TREE THEY PUT UP EVERY YEAR 
WHERE THERE IS
20:03:00  A SIGN THERE.
BUT IT IS BEHIND A PARK
20:03:03  AND 
RIDE.
BUT IT IS INTENDED TO BE VISIBLE 

20:03:06 FROM 680.
I THINK THE OTHER ONE YOU'RE 
TALKING ABOUT
20:03:09  YOU SAID ON AUTO 
MALL, I THINK THAT'S
20:03:12  A 76 
STATION.
>> Commissioner Steckler:   76.

20:03:15 >> Planner Pullen:   I'M NOT 
SURE THE HEIGHT OF THAT.
20:03:19 
JUST TO RELATE, STAFF'S
20:03:22  
FEEDBACK,
20:03:26  THERE ARE SIGNS 
ALLOWED BY OUR SIGN CODE
20:03:30  ON 
HIGHWAYS.
AND THE COUNCIL
20:03:33  HAS PURVIEW OVER 
THOSE SIGNS.
AND SO YOU CAN
20:03:36  -- YOU HAVE 
DISCRETION TO MAKE DECISIONS 
ABOUT
20:03:40  THEM.
THOSE DECISIONS WILL IMPACT THE 
RESPECT
20:03:43 IVE BUSINESSES AND IN 
THIS
20:03:46  SITUATION, THE PARTICULAR 
CHALLENGE
20:03:50  IS THE EXTENT TO WHICH 
THE PROPERTY DOESN'T
20:03:53  ALLOW A 
BUILDING TO BE PLACED IN THE 
VICINITY
20:03:57 .
AND THERE ARE LOTS OF PLACES 
WHERE YOU'VE GOT
20:04:01  THOSE BUILDINGS 
ON OTHER PORTIONS OF THE 
FREEWAY, NOT SO
20:04:04  MUCH ON OSGOOD 
BECAUSE OF THE POWER LINES IN
20:04:07  
THIS VICINITY WHERE THEY CAN 
COME
20:04:10  OUT CLOSER.
THAT IS THE LIMITATION OF
20:04:14  THIS 
SITUATION.
IF YOU ARE NOT TO ALLOW THE SIGN 

20:04:17 THE OPTIONS WOULD BE LIMITED FOR 
THEM TO GET THAT FREE WAY 
VISIBILITY
20:04:21 .
>> Commissioner Daulton:   THANK 
YOU JOEL.

20:04:24 COMMISSIONERS DO WE HAVE ANY 
OTHER DISCUSSION ON THIS ITEM?
COMMISSIONER LIU,
20:04:27  PLEASE.
>> Commissioner Liu:   I THINK 
COMMISSIONER YEE HAS
20:04:30  HAD HIS 
HAND UP ON --
20:04:32  FIRST.
SO.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   

20:04:35 COMMISSIONER YEE, CHAIR 
RECOGNIZES YOU.
>> Commissioner Yee:   THAT'S 

20:04:38 OKAY.
I'LL LET COMMISSIONER LIU GO 
FIRST.

20:04:41 >> Commissioner Liu:   OKAY, 
THANK YOU.

20:04:51 SO I HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE 
STAFF.
ONCE
20:04:54  THIS SIGN IS ACTUALLY BUILT 
IS THIS POSITION
20:04:57  EVER 
REVERSIBLE, IF WE GET TOO
20:05:01  MANY 
COMPLAINTS IS THERE ANY WAY WE 
CAN HAVE THE COMPANY TAKE IT
20:05:04  
DOWN ONCE IT'S BUILT?
>> Planner Pullen:   ONCE
20:05:07  A SIGN 
WOULD BE APPROVED, A USE
20:05:10  PERMIT 
RUNS WITH THE LAND, AN APPROVAL 
RUNS WITH THE
20:05:14  LAND.
THAT SAID,
20:05:17  REMEMBERING BACK TO 
WHAT JAMES AND CLIFF MENTIONED, 
IN THE CONDITIONS
20:05:20  OF APPROVAL 
THAT WE SHARED THERE ARE QUITE A 
FEW CONTROLS IN THERE
20:05:23  THAT 
RELATE TO THINGS THAT YOU AS THE 
COMMISSION COULD MODIFY
20:05:27 .
YOU HAVEN'T HEARD THE COMMISSION 
TONIGHT GO INTO
20:05:30  ANY OF THAT.
IN TERMS OF IF
20:05:33  THERE WOULD BE A
20:05:37  
PERSPECTIVE AMENDMENT TO THE 
SIZE OR WIDTH OR
20:05:40  HEIGHT, 
ET CETERA.
THOSE ARE THINGS WITHIN THE 

20:05:43 COMMISSION'S PURVIEW.
AND
20:05:46  SO, YOU KNOW, I'M STRUGGLING 
TO THINK OF A
20:05:49  SITUATION IN WHICH 
YOU COULD APPROVE AND THEN 
REVISIT.

20:05:52 IT'S REALLY NOT FEASIBLE BECAUSE 
THESE TYPE OF SIGNS ARE
20:05:56  QUITE 
EXPENSIVE TO BUILD AND IT'S NOT 
SOMETHING YOU COULD
20:05:59  JUST, YOU 
KNOW, MODIFY AFTER THE FACT.
BUT YOU COULD, YOU
20:06:03  COULD DIRECT 
THE DESIGN OF IT AND MAKE SURE
20:06:06  
THAT IT WERE TO BE DESIGNED IN A 
WAY THAT MET
20:06:09  CERTAIN THINGS THAT 
ARE IMPORTANT TO YOU
20:06:13 .
20:06:17 
>> AND JUST TO ADD TO WHAT JOEL 
HAS MENTIONED, THE HEIGHT OF THE
20:06:20  
SIGN THAT IS BEING PROPOSED BY 
PAPE,
20:06:23  YES IT DOES SEEM TO BE
20:06:26  
PARTICULARLY TALL BUT THERE IS 
THAT GRADE DIFFERENTIAL FROM THE 

20:06:30 HIGHWAY BEING ABOVE THERE AT 680 
AND THEN THE GRADE
20:06:33 , THE 
ELEVATION OF WHERE THE PAPE 
BUILDING SITS
20:06:37  AND THIS SIGN IS 
ADJACENT TO THE BUILDING.
IF YOU COMPARE THAT TO THE
20:06:40  SIGNS 
AT THE AUTO MALL AND THE PACIFIC 
COMMONS
20:06:43  SIGN, THE BLOCK SIGN ON 
880, THOSE
20:06:46  ARE SIGNS THAT ARE I
20:06:50  
THINK IT'S -- THE BLOCK SIGN IS 
1
20:06:53 10 FEET IN HEIGHT AND THE AUTO 
MALL SIGN IS 70 FEET
20:06:56  IN HEIGHT.
WHERE THE SIGNS, THOSE SIGNS ARE 
MOUNTED
20:06:59  THE GRADES, THE ADJACENT 
GRADES OF THE FREEWAY
20:07:02  ARE 
SIMILAR.
AND SO ALTHOUGH
20:07:05  YOU SEE ON THE 
PLANS THE SIGN'S AT 40
20:07:09  FEET IN 
HEIGHT, FROM 680 IT'S GOING TO 
BE
20:07:12  MUCH SHORTER.
>> Commissioner Daulton:  
20:07:16  
MR. YEE PLEASE.
>> Commissioner Yee:   YES,
20:07:19  THIS 
IS ACTUALLY TO PIGGYBACK OFF OF
20:07:20  
WHAT COMMISSIONER STECKLER IS 
SAYING.

20:07:23 YOU KNOW DRIVING UP AND DOWN 680 
I
20:07:26  DEFINITELY UNDERSTAND WHERE 
COMMISSIONER STECKLER IS TALKING
20:07:30  
ABOUT SEEING THESE SIGNS ON THE 
PROPERTY OF THE
20:07:33  McDONALD'S.
AND
20:07:36  THAT UNION 76 GAS STAKES 
THERE BECAUSE
20:07:39  OF THE PROXIMITY 
OF WHERE THESE TWO BUSINESSES 
ARE LOCATED.
20:07:42 
BUT THEN THIS SIGN WOULD BE THE 
FIRST BASED ON WHAT I'M SEEING 

20:07:46 ON THE BLUEPRINTS RIGHT UP 
AGAINST THE 680 FREEWAY
20:07:49  WHILE 
THESE OTHERS ARE NOT.
AND SO THAT IS THE
20:07:53  CONCERN THAT 
I HAVE AS WELL THAT SETTING THIS 
AS A PRECEDENT
20:07:56 , THAT IT COULD 
OPEN THE DOOR AND THEN MAKE THIS
20:07:59  
680 EVENTUALLY BECOME WHAT WE
20:08:02  
SEE CURRENTLY ALREADY AT 880.
THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO
20:08:06  SAY.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   YES
20:08:10 .
COMMISSIONER YEE, I AGREE WITH 
YOU ON THAT POINT
20:08:14 .
AND I DON'T
20:08:17  MYSELF SEE A GOOD 
WAY TO REDESIGN THIS
20:08:20  THING ON 
THE FLY HERE IN THE COURSE OF 
THIS MEETING
20:08:25 .
COMMISSIONER ZHANG, GO AHEAD
20:08:29 .
>> Commissioner Zhang:   I JUST 
TAKE A LOOK
20:08:32  AT THE McDONALD'S 
SIGN, IT'S PROBABLY SIX OR EIGHT
20:08:35  
FEET TALL IN FRONT OF THEIR OWN 
BUILDING, IT'S NOT LIKE THE
20:08:39  
SIGN,
20:08:44  POST SIGN, I JUST WANT TO 
POINT OUT,
20:08:47  QUITE DIFFERENT THAN 
WHAT THIS PROPOSED.

20:08:54 >> Commissioner Daulton:   
COMMISSIONER ZHANG YOU'RE 
TALKING WHEN THE SIGN ON
20:08:58  --
>> Commissioner Zhang:   ON 
McDONALD'S.

20:09:01 THAT IS THE BASE ON THEIR OWN 
BUILDING LIKE SIX FEET TALL IF
20:09:03  I 
SEE CORRECTLY.
YES.

20:09:07 INDEED YOU CAN SEE IT FROM THE 
HIGHWAY THOUGH
20:09:10  I GUESS.
IF YOU DRIVE ON THE RIGHT SIDE 
OF THE LANE
20:09:15 .
SORRY.

20:09:18 >> Commissioner Daulton:   OKAY.
ARE THERE
20:09:21  ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS
20:09:24 ?
MR. LIU
20:09:28 .
>> Commissioner Liu:   DO WE 
HAVE ANY RENDITION OF THE 

20:09:32 BUILDING WITH THE SIGNS ATTACHED 
TO THE, EITHER FRONT OR
20:09:35  BACK 
SIDE OF THE BUILDING?
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, I DRIVE
20:09:38  BY 
OSGOOD QUITE OFTEN AND INDEED 
THAT,
20:09:42  YOUR NEW BUILDING LOOKS 
WONDERFUL, I'M
20:09:45  VERY IMPRESSED.
AND IS YOUR SIREN ON
20:09:48  THE FRONT 
GOING TO DO -- GOING TO GIVE YOU 
SIMILAR
20:09:52  KIND OF ADVERTISING 
VALUE, IF YOU PUT
20:09:55  IT UP FRONT?
AND FRANKLY IF YOU LOOK AT
20:09:59  YOUR 
USER BASE, YOUR CUSTOMER BASE,
20:10:02  
MOST OF THEM ARE PROBABLY IN A 
SPECIFIC TRADE.
20:10:06 
NOT THE KIND OF MASS CONSUMER
20:10:10 , 
EVERYDAY, AVERAGE PEOPLE WHO
20:10:13  
WOULD PROBABLY GO TO 
McDONALD'S OR PLACES LIKE 

20:10:16 THERE TO EAT, RIGHT?
MAYBE IT'S AN EASIER IF YOU
20:10:20  DO 
SOME MORE TARGETED MARKETING 
TOWARDS THE TRADES
20:10:23  FOLKS.
>> Planner Pullen:  
20:10:27  SO CHAIR 
DAULTON, THE PUBLIC HEARING IS
20:10:29  
CLOSED.
I'M NOT SURE WHETHER THE --

20:10:33 >> Commissioner Daulton:   WE 
CAN'T READDRESS QUESTIONS TO THE 
APPLICANT AT THIS TIME
20:10:36 .
>> Planner Pullen:   OKAY.
20:10:40 
YOU COULD REOPEN THE PUBLIC 
HEARING BUT THEN YOU
20:10:43  WOULD HAVE 
TO ASK IF THERE ARE ANY MEMBERS 
OF THE PUBLIC WHO WOULD LIKE
20:10:47  TO 
SPEAK AS WELL, THAT IS WITHIN 
YOUR PURVIEW OR YOU
20:10:50  COULD LEAVE 
IT CLOSED OR YOU COULD
20:10:53  ASK ANY 
QUESTIONS RELATED TO STAFF.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   I'D 

20:10:56 LIKE TO ASK JAMES TO BRING UP 
THE RENDERING
20:10:58  OF THE COMPLETED 
BUILDING AGAIN FOR JUST A 
MOMENT.

20:11:11 SO I SEE HERE QUITE A LARGE SIGN 
ON THE FRONT
20:11:14  OF THE BUILDING, 
I'M
20:11:17  NOT SURE WHY A SIGN LIKE 
THAT COULDN'T BE
20:11:20  REPLICATED, AND 
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE 
BUILDING FACING
20:11:23  THE TREE WAY, I 
BELIEVE
20:11:27  FREEWAY, 
THIS MAY
20:11:30  HAVE BEEN WHAT
20:11:33  
COMMISSIONER YEE WAS TALKING 
ABOUT, PAPER BANNER,
20:11:36  SIGNS FOR 
US, SOME LIKE THAT.
I DO
20:11:39  RECOGNIZE THAT THE PAPE 
SIGN IS KNOWN
20:11:42  FROM MEXICO TO 
CANADA AND I'VE SEEN IT MANY, 
MANY TIMES
20:11:47 .
I JUST WONDER
20:11:51  IF SMACK DAB UNDER 
MISSION PEAK
20:11:55  IS THE PLACE WHERE 
I WANT TO SEE ONE
20:11:58 .
>> IF COMMISSIONER COULD GIVE ME
20:12:02  
A MOMENT I COULD BRING UP THE 
ORIGINAL PLANS FOR THE
20:12:04  PAPE 
PROJECT AND SHOW YOU THE 
DISTANCE BETWEEN THE BUILDING 

20:12:08 AND THE FREEWAY AND ALSO THE 
SLAIP OF THE BACK OF THE 
BUILDING SO JUST
20:12:11  GIVE ME ONE 
MOMENT TO DOWNLOAD THOSE PLANS
20:12:15 .
20:12:58 
CAN YOU SEE THAT?
LET ME ENLARGE THAT FOR YOU.

20:13:09 AS YOU CAN SEE HERE, THE 
BUILDING IS OVER 291
20:13:12  FEET FROM 
THE REAR PROPERTY LINE.
THE FREEWAY'S ACTUALLY
20:13:15  A LITTLE 
BIT FARTHER FROM THAT BECAUSE 
THERE IS THE
20:13:19  EMBANKMENT.
THE FREEWAY TRAVEL LANES ARE 
HERE WHICH
20:13:22  WOULD PUT IT OVER 300 
FEET
20:13:25  AWAY FROM THE FREEWAY.
IF YOU GIVE ME A MOMENT TO FIND 
THE
20:13:29  ELEVATIONS, THE REAR 
ELEVATIONS, THE BUILDING ON THE 
BACK
20:13:32  DOESN'T LOOK LIKE THE ONE 
ON THE FRONT.
WHAT YOU'RE SEEING ON THE
20:13:35  FRONT 
IS THE DEALERSHIP.
THE BACK PART
20:13:40  IS THE SERVICE 
BAYS.
20:13:43 
AND THIS IS WHAT THE REAR OF THE
20:13:46  
BUILDING LOOKS LIKE.
SO IT DOESN'T HAVE THE
20:13:50  LARGE 
STRIKING FRONTAGE THAT IT DOES 
FACE
20:13:54 ING OSGOOD.
THIS IS THE BACK PART OF THE 
BUILDING WHICH IS MORE
20:13:55  
INDUSTRIAL IN NATURE.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   CAN 

20:13:59 YOU TELL ME HOW TALL THAT IS AT 
THE PEAK
20:14:02  THERE?
>> YES.
THE BUILDING
20:14:05  TO THE TOP OF THE 
MECHANICAL SCREEN IS 40
20:14:08  FEET 
ABOVE GRADE.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   SO 

20:14:11 YOU'RE TELLING ME IF THEY PUT 
THEIR SIGN RIGHT UNDERNEATH
20:14:15  THAT 
PEAK YOU DON'T THINK IT COULD BE 
SEEN FROM THE FREEWAY?
20:14:19 
>> 300 FEET AWAY FROM THE 
FREEWAY
20:14:23  AND PARALLEL TO THE 
FREEWAY TO CATCH THE EYE OF THE 
TRAVELING
20:14:26  PUBLIC.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   
GRANTED IT WOULD BE BETTER IF 

20:14:29 YOU COULD PAINT IT ON THE 
FREEWAY ITSELF, I
20:14:32  SUPPOSE BUT IT 
COULD STILL BE SEEN RIGHT
20:14:36 ?
>> I WOULD ASK IF YOU WOULD BE 
DRIVING BY
20:14:40  65 MILES AN HOUR YOU 
WOULD HAVE YOUR
20:14:43  HEAD TURNED IN 
THAT DIRECTION, MAYBE IN SOME
20:14:46  
TESLAS, BUT NOT
20:14:49  IN MY VEHICLE 
WOULD I BE TURNING MY HEAD
20:14:53  OVER 
AT FREEWAY SPEEDS.
BUT IT MIGHT
20:14:56  BE BRIEFLY VISIBLE 
TO A PASSENGERS
20:14:59  PASSENGER.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   OKAY.
ANY
20:15:02  OTHER QUESTIONS FROM 
COMMISSIONERS?
ANY
20:15:05  SUGGESTIONS ON ANY WAY WE 
CAN COMPROMISE AND CREATE A
20:15:09  SIGN 
HERE ON THE FLY?

20:15:13 OR LIMIT THE SIZE OF
20:15:17  THIS PYLON 
SIGN IN SOME WAY?

20:15:21 IF NOT, I'D LIKE TO ENTERTAIN A 
MOTION.

20:15:28 >> Commissioner Liu:   YOU KNOW 
I'D LIKE TO MAKE THE BUSINESS 
FEEL
20:15:31  WELCOME IN FREMONT.
BECAUSE
20:15:34  THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT 
FOR OUR EMPLOYMENT
20:15:38 .
AND WOULD
20:15:41  -- LIKE CHAIR DAULTON 
SAID, ARE THERE ANY OTHER WAYS
20:15:46  
TO GIVE THE VISIBILITY FROM THE 
FREEWAY
20:15:50  BY MAYBE PUTTING THE 
SIGNS ON THE REAR OF THE
20:15:53  
BUILDING, MAYBE MAKING THE REAR 
SIDE OF THE BUILDING A
20:15:56  LITTLE 
BIT HIGHER AND MAYBE PUT THE 
SIGN THERE AND JUST
20:15:59  NOT SO 
PRPBTD-SETTING
20:16:03  
PRECEDENT-SETTING
20:16:06  AND YET IN THE 
MEANTIME GIVE
20:16:09  THEM A LOT OF 
VISIBILITY.
THIS IS NOT
20:16:13  THE PLACE TO DESIGN 
THE
20:16:19  SIGNS ON THE FLY BUT THERE 
IS QUITE A BIT OF CONCERN ABOUT 
THE
20:16:22  ENORMITY OF THE SIGN ON THE 
FREEWAY
20:16:26  THAT'S CURRENTLY PRETTY 
NATURAL LOOKING.

20:16:32 >> Planner Pullen:   SO 
COMMISSIONER LIU,
20:16:36  PROMOTED YOU, 
SORRY
20:16:38 .
>> Commissioner Liu:   THANK 
YOU.

20:16:41 >> Planner Pullen:   SORRY, 
CHAIR DAULTON.
SO IF YOU WERE TO PUT
20:16:44  A SIGN ON 
THE BACK OF THE BUILDING, THAT'S 
ALLOWED
20:16:47  BY OUR CODE
20:16:51  THROUGH 
STANDARD RULES.
BUT THE SIZE IS
20:16:54  SOMEWHAT LIMITED 
BECAUSE IT'S
20:16:57  AT A PRIMARY 
FRONTAGE.
AND I DON'T HAVE
20:17:00  THAT FIGURE  OFF 
THE TOP OF MY HEAD
20:17:03 .
JAMES MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO 
RESEARCH.

20:17:06 BUT A SIGN ON THE BACK OF THE 
BUILDING WOULD NOT BE SUBJECT
20:17:10  TO 
COMMISSION REVIEW.
THEY COULD MAXIMIZE THAT AND IT
20:17:13  
MIGHT PROVIDE AS JAMES MENTIONED 
A LITTLE BIT OF VISIBILITY
20:17:16  BUT 
AGAIN THE INTENT OF THE 
APPLICANT IS TO GET A HIGHER 

20:17:20 LEVEL OF VISIBILITY FROM DIRECT 
FREEWAY EXPOSURE
20:17:24 .
I THINK THAT THE -- JAMES, I'M 
GOING
20:17:27  OFF MEMORY FROM THE REPORT 
BUT I THINK
20:17:31  THAT THE ACTUAL
20:17:34  -- 
THE DOWN GRADE FROM THE FREEWAY 
IS
20:17:37  ABOUT 13 FEET.
AND THE DISTANCE
20:17:41 , I DON'T KNOW 
THE NUMBER.
BUT THE FREEWAY HEIGHT
20:17:44  OF 40 
FEET, THAT PLACES THE TOP OF THE
20:17:47  
SIGN AT 27-ISH
20:17:50  AND THEN THE SIGN 
COPY PROBABLY
20:17:54  BETWEEN -- 
DEPENDING HOW TALL THE SIGN IS,
20:17:58  
MAYBE THE SIGN IS ABOUT EIGHT OR 
TEN FEET TALL, SO
20:18:01  MAYBE THE SIGN 
IS ABOUT 19 TO 27 FEET OFF GRADE
20:18:03 
GRADE.
IS THAT ABOUT RIGHT JAMES?

20:18:06 I WANT TO GIVE THE COMMISSION 
THE LAY OF THE LAND FOR BUILDING
20:18:09  
OPTION AND THE FRAIMENT WORK FOR 
THAT AND
20:18:12  FRAMEWORK FOR 
THAT AND WHERE
20:18:15  THE SIGN LAYS IN 
SPACE.
JAMES ANY CLARIFICATION
20:18:18 ?
>> YES, THAT'S APPROXIMATELY 
CORRECT.

20:18:21 >> Planner Pullen:   JAMES DO 
YOU KNOW THE SIGN LIMIT FOR THE 
BUILDING -- THE BUILDING
20:18:24  IS ONLY 
AT 40 FEET.
THE BUILDING COULD BE BY OUR 

20:18:28 STANDARD CODE EXTENDED TO 75 
FEET IN HEIGHT
20:18:32 .
AND SO ASSIGN ON
20:18:35  AA
20:18:41  A
20:18:44  SIGN ON THAT COULD BE 
ALLOWED FOR A STANDARD RULE.
20:18:48 
>> AN INDUSTRIAL BUILDING 
MOUNTED SIGN IS
20:18:51  ALLOWED TO BE 
HALF GAIR
20:18:55  FOOT, ONE HALF TIMES 
THE LENGTH OF THE BUILDING
20:18:58  
FRONTAGE PARALLEL WITH THE 
FREEWAY
20:19:02 , MAXIMUM 200 SQUARE 
FEET.
IN THIS CASE
20:19:06 , LET ME SEE WHAT 
THE BUILDING'S WIDTH WAS IF
20:19:09  I 
CAN FIND THAT
20:19:12 .
I'LL HAVE TO LOOK FOR A MOMENT
20:19:15  
IN THE ORIGINAL PLANS TO FIND 
THE WIDTH OF THE BUILDING.
20:19:18 
OH HERE IT IS.
>> Planner Pullen:   AND THAT 

20:19:21 WOULD BE THE -- ALL RIGHT.
>> SORRY.
THE BUILDING
20:19:24  IS ABOUT 1
20:19:28 40, A 
LITTLE
20:19:32  LESS THAN 140 FEET WIDE.
SO THE SIGN WOULD BE LIMIT
20:19:35 ED TO 
ABOUT
20:19:39  60, 65 SQUARE FEET.
20:19:42 
>> Planner Pullen:   SO IF YOU 
SQUARE THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT 

20:19:45 A SEVEN BY EIGHT OR SO
20:19:50  SQUARE ON 
THE BACK OF THE BUILDING, IS 
THAT RIGHT?

20:19:53 >> YES.
>> Planner Pullen:   BECAUSE 
IT'S SQUARE FEET.
20:19:56 
>> YES.

20:20:03 >> Planner Pullen:   FOR 
PERSPECTIVE.
DOES THAT ANSWER THE
20:20:06  QUESTION,
20:20:10  
COMMISSIONER LIU?
>> Commissioner Liu:   YEAH.

20:20:13 >> Commissioner Daulton:   YES 
CAN I GET A MOTION PLEASE
20:20:16 ?
>> Commissioner Rao:   I HAVE A 
QUESTION.

20:20:19 >> Commissioner Daulton:   YES.
20:20:22 
>> Commissioner Rao:   I WAS 
THINKING THE SIGN PERPENDICULAR
20:20:25  
TO THE BUILDING NOT AS A PYLON 
BUT ATTACHED TO THE
20:20:28  BUILDING.
FACING THIS WAY NOT THIS WAY BUT 
THIS WAY
20:20:32 .
I DON'T KNOW.
I CAN'T
20:20:35  EXPLAIN THAT.
RIGHT ANGLE TO THE BUILDING
20:20:38 .
>> Planner Pullen:   YES, I 
UNDERSTAND THE QUESTION AND 

20:20:41 WHILE IT'S SPECULATIVE BECAUSE 
I'M NOT A SIGN DESIGNER
20:20:44  AND I 
APOLOGIZE TO KELLY REID FROM
20:20:48  
RAMSAY SIGNS BUT I'M GOING TO 
TRY.

20:20:51 IF YOU LAY OUT A SIGN YOU KNOW 
YOU'RE LOOKING AT
20:20:54  THE ANGLE 
SOMEONE'S GOING TO SEE IT FROM.
AND
20:20:58  IF YOU REMEMBER, THE 
BUILDING SITE
20:21:02  IS KIND OF A 
PARALLELOGRAM.
20:21:05 
AND IF YOU ARE COMING TO THE 
BUILDING
20:21:08  WITH THE BUILDING SET 
IN YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE
20:21:12  TO SEE 
THE SIGN THIS WAY VERSUS THIS 
WAY, I DON'T KNOW,
20:21:15  YOU'D HAVE TO 
LOOK AT THE SITE LINES AND THE 
ADJACENT BUILDINGS
20:21:18 .
IT WOULD BE HARD TO SAY WHETHER 
THAT WOULD BE BETTER OFF THE 

20:21:21 CUFF OR NOT.
IF THAT WERE CLOSE DEFINITELY 
THAT
20:21:26  WOULD BE BETTER THAN THE 
SIDE OF THE
20:21:29  BUILDING.
20:21:32 
>> Commissioner Liu:   MAY I 
MAKE A MOTION TO,
20:21:36  CONDITIONALLY 
APPROVE THE SIGN
20:21:40  WHICH 
ADDITIONAL COMMUNITY INPUT TO 
TAKE MORE
20:21:43  SURVEYS FROM THE 
PUBLIC
20:21:47 ?
>> Planner Pullen:   LET ME 
SPEAK TO THAT
20:21:50 .
SO COMMISSIONER LIU, APPROVE
20:21:53 ING 
THE SIGN WOULD NEED TO BE 
SPECIFIC AS TO
20:21:57  WHAT THE SIGN IS 
GOING TO BE.
IF YOU
20:22:00  WANT ADDITIONAL COMMUNITY 
INPUT, WE WOULDN'T
20:22:03  KNOW WHAT 
THAT WOULD BE UNTIL WE GET IT.
AND SO
20:22:06  IT SOUNDS LIKE TO ME 
THAT'S A MOTION FOR A 
CONTINUANCE
20:22:10 .
TO GET MORE INPUT BEFORE 
BRINGING IT BACK
20:22:13  FOR REVIEW.
20:22:16 
AND, YOU KNOW, I THINK A COUPLE 
THINGS
20:22:19  I'D WANT TO RECOMMEND IF 
YOU WERE TO GO DOWN THAT ROAD
20:22:22  AS 
A COMMISSION, ONE WOULD BE FOR 
YOU TO GIVE YOUR
20:22:25  OWN FEEDBACK 
ABOUT THE SIGN
20:22:29  TO THE APPLICANT 
AS DIRECTION.
ONE
20:22:33  WOULD BE TO IDENTIFY TIME 
FRAME
20:22:36  WHERE YOU'D LIKE TO SEE IT 
BACK
20:22:40 .
>> Commissioner Liu:   YES.
>> Planner Pullen:   AND THEN I 

20:22:43 THINK IT WOULD BE PRUDENT TO GET 
THE APPLICANT'S
20:22:46  INPUT ON SUCH A 
MOTION.
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW
20:22:50  WHAT 
THEY'RE OPEN TO.
IT WOULD BE GOOD TO
20:22:53  GET FEEDBACK 
FROM THEM, TO
20:22:56  REOPEN THE PUBLIC 
HEARING, IF THE
20:23:00  COMMISSION WANTS 
TO GO THAT WAY.
>> Commissioner Liu:   SO
20:23:03  I 
MOTION TO CONTINUE THIS SIGN
20:23:06  
DECISION WITH MORE STUDY AND 
MORE PUBLIC INPUT
20:23:10 .

20:23:14 >> Commissioner Steckler:   I 
SECOND.
I SECOND THE MOTION.

20:23:17 >> Commissioner Daulton:   ALL 
RIGHT.
CAN WE HAVE A VOTE ON THAT JOEL
20:23:22 ?
>> Planner Pullen:   SO IT WOULD 
BE GOOD -- SO THERE'S
20:23:24  BEEN SOME 
FEEDBACK FROM THE COMMISSION SO 
FAR.

20:23:27 DOES THE COMMISSION WANT TO GIVE 
ANY MORE DIRECTION ON WHAT
20:23:30  THEY 
CONSIDER WOULD BE SUFFICIENT 
PUBLIC OUTREACH
20:23:34  OR INPUT ON 
THAT?
OR DO YOU WANT
20:23:38  TO GET FEEDBACK 
FROM THE APPLICANT BEFORE MAKING 
THAT MOTION OR DO YOU WANT TO
20:23:42  
JUST VOTE ON IT?
>> Commissioner Daulton:  
20:23:45  
ANYONE?
I SAY
20:23:48  LET'S GO FOR A VOTE.

20:23:55 >> MAYBE WE CAN JUST A 
SUGGESTION, MAYBE WE CAN HELP 
THE
20:23:58  COMMISSION OUT AND IF I 
UNDERSTAND COMMISSIONER LIU IS
20:24:01  
THAT YOU WANT SOME NOR VISUAL 
STUDIES HERE.
20:24:05 
AND THERE WAS A MEDICATION OF 
STORY POLLS
20:24:09  AND MAYBE 
PHOTOSIMULATIONS FROM THE 
FREEWAY TO HELP
20:24:12  YOU WITH A 
DECISION WHETHER OR NOT YOU 
THINK THE SIGN,
20:24:15  THE DESIGN, THE 
HEIGHT AND THE SIZE IS 
APPROPRIATE
20:24:18 .
IS THAT CORRECT?
IS THAT WHAT
20:24:21  --
>> Commissioner Liu:   RIGHT, I 
THINK THAT'S CORRECT.

20:24:24 >> YEAH, AND I THINK IF THAT'S 
THE CASE THEN THAT'S THE 
DIRECTION
20:24:27  THAT CAN BE GIVEN TO 
THE APPLICANT AND THEY
20:24:31  CAN 
PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION,
20:24:34  
PROVIDE ADDITIONAL DIGITAL
20:24:37  
ANALYSIS AND BRING THAT BACK TO 
THE COMMISSION
20:24:41 .
>> Planner Pullen:   AND DO SOME 
COMMUNITY OUTREACH.

20:24:44 I'M GUESSING THAT MEANS FROM 
WHAT I CAN GATHER,
20:24:47  COMMISSIONER 
LIU, MAYBE TALKING TO NEIGHBORS
20:24:51  
AND ADJACENT PEOPLE WHO WOULD BE 
ABLE TO VIEW THE SIGN
20:24:54 ?
AND GETTING FEEDBACK?
>> Commissioner Liu:   YES.
20:24:58 
SOME KIND OF -- I GUESS 
SIMULATION
20:25:04 , SHOWING WHAT THE 
DRIVERS COULD SEE
20:25:07 , GOING 
NORTHBOUND, SOUTHBOUND, 680.

20:25:12 >> Planner Pullen:   THIS IS 
REALLY FOCUSED ON THE
20:25:15  PEOPLE, 
FOCUSED ON THE VISUAL
20:25:19  LIKE RICK 
WAS SAYING, STORY POLES,
20:25:22  
PERSPECTIVE DRAWINGS.
WE GOT IT.

20:25:25 SORRY TO BEG
20:25:29  YOUR FORGIVENESS 
DAULTON.

20:25:32 >> Commissioner Daulton:   OKAY 
WE HAVE A MOTION AND SECOND.
LET'S HAVE A VOTE.

20:25:38 JOEL YOU WANT TO CALL THE ROLL?
20:25:40 
>> Planner Pullen:   SORRY ABOUT 
THAT.

20:25:43 MY DEVICE WITH MY
20:25:47  LIST TIMED 
OUT.
I APOLOGIZE
20:25:50 .
ONE MOMENT.
THERE WE GO
20:25:53 , ALL RIGHT, ON THE 
MOTION TO CONTINUE THE ITEM, TO
20:25:56  
ALLOW THE APPLICANT TO DO
20:26:00  
ADDITIONAL VISUAL SIMULATION AND 
COMMUNITY OUT
20:26:03 REACH.
20:26:07 
BY COMMISSIONER LIU, SECONDED BY 
COMMISSIONER STECKLER I BELIEVE
20:26:10 .
WHEN I CALL YOUR NAME PLEASE 
STATE YOUR VOTE
20:26:13 .
CHAIR DAULTON, NO
20:26:16 .
VICE CHAIR RAO
20:26:19 , AYE.
COMMISSIONER YEE, NO
20:26:23 .
COMMISSIONER STECKLER.
AYE
20:26:26 .
COMMISSIONER LIU.
AYE
20:26:30 .
SO --
20:26:34  AND COMMISSIONER ZHANG.
20:26:36 
>> Commissioner Zhang:   AYE.
JUST WANT TO SEE MORE.

20:26:41 >> Planner Pullen:   ALL RIGHT.
SO TRADITION, DO YOU HAVE
20:26:48  TRISH, DO YOU HAVE A RECORD 
OF THE VOTE?
20:26:51 
I WAS READING, NOT MARKING.
20:26:55 
>> JOEL, IT'S TRISH.
I WASN'T MARKING IT
20:26:58  MYSELF.
I APOLOGIZE.
>> Planner Pullen:  
20:27:01  OKAY SO I 
HAD DAULTON AS -- CHAIR DAULTON
20:27:04  
AS A NO.
VICE CHAIR RAO AS AN
20:27:08  AYE.
I
20:27:11  HAD COMMISSIONER YEE AS A NO.
I
20:27:15  HAD COMMISSIONER STECKLER
20:27:18  AS 
ANNAL AYE.
COMMISSIONER LIU AS
20:27:21  AN AYE.
20:27:26 
COMMISSIONER ZHANG AS AN AYE.
IF THAT WAS
20:27:29  CORRECT IT WOULD BE 
4-TWO.
20:27:32 2
20:27:37 .
>> Commissioner Zhang:   I'M 
SORRY, THIS IS MY FIRST
20:27:40  TIME.
CAN I HAVE A CLARIFICATION 
MOTION,
20:27:43  THAT MEANS THE CITY IS 
GOING TO BRING THAT TOPIC
20:27:47  BACK 
SOMETIME IN THE FUTURE AND 
PRESENT THE VICIALTZED ITEM
20:27:50  AND 
DECIDE GO OR NO GO IS THAT 
CORRECT?

20:27:53 >> Planner Pullen:   NO, NO 
ACTION WILL BE TAKEN UNTIL WE 
COME BACK
20:27:56  TO THE COMMISSION 
BASED ON THE VOTE.
SO 4-2,
20:28:00  THE ACTION TO CONTINUE 
THE ITEM,
20:28:03  HAS BEEN APPROVED.
SO THE PLANNING COMMISSION'S 
ACTION ON
20:28:06  THIS ITEM IS TO PUSH 
THE ITEM
20:28:09  TO AN UPCOMING AGENDA.
WE'LL RENOTICE THE
20:28:13  ITEM AND 
BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMISSION 
FOR REVIEW
20:28:17 .
AND FOR FINAL DECISION
20:28:20 .
SO I APPRECIATE THE COMMISSION'S 
REVIEW
20:28:23  OF THE ITEM AND THAT ITEM 
IS CONCLUDED.
20:28:26 
BACK TO YOU, CHAIR.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   ALL 

20:28:30 RIGHT.
NEXT ITEM ON THE AGENDA IS THE 
EN
20:28:34 CORE PLUS STUDIOS C.U.P.
20:28:37 
DO WE HAVE A PRESENTATION FROM 
STAFF ON THIS ITEM
20:28:41 ?
>> Planner Pullen:   ONCE AGAIN 
CHAIR, THE PROJECT
20:28:44  PLANNER JAMES 
WILLIS IS AVAILABLE
20:28:47  WITH 
GRAPHICS AND INFORMATION.
BUT DOESN'T NEED
20:28:50  TO DO A FORMAL 
PRESENTATION FOR THIS
20:28:53  ITEM.
LET ME START BY READING THE 
ITEM.
20:28:56 
ENCORE PLUS STUDIO CONDITIONAL 
USE PERMIT, IS
20:29:00  A PROJECT AT
20:29:03 
46132 WARM SPRINGS BOULEVARD --

CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT TO ALLOW
BEER AND WINE SALES AT AN

20:29:11 EXISTING KARAOKE STUDIO LOCATED
20:29:14 
AT 46132 WARM SPRINGS BOULEVARD

20:29:28 
PURSUANT TO CEQA GUIDELINES
20:29:33 
SECTION 15301 AND 15183
20:29:37 .
AFTER JAMES IS AVAILABLE FOR 
QUESTIONS IF THE COMMISSION
20:29:40  
WANTS TO ASK HIM ANY QUESTIONS 
THE APPLICANT WOULD BE
20:29:43  GIVEN 
ORDINARILY TEN MINUTES

20:30:01 
GO AHEAD COMMISSIONER.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   

20:30:04 COMMISSIONERS DO YOU HAVE ANY 
QUESTIONS FOR JAMES OF THIS ITEM
20:30:06 
ITEM?
I DON'T SEE DESTINY QUESTIONS.

20:30:12 SO
20:30:20  TRISH DO WE HAVE ANY PUBLIC
20:30:23  
INPUT ON THIS IDEA?
>> Commissioner Yee:   I DO HAVE 

20:30:27 A QUESTION, WE DO HAVE ONE OF 
FREMONT'S FINEST
20:30:30  WITH US, 
CORRECT, FREMONT POLICE?
>> Planner Pullen:   YES,
20:30:34  SORRY 
COMMISSIONER YEE, WE INVITED 
MICHELLE
20:30:37  GRISSE WHO IS OUR
20:30:40  
REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE POLICE 
DEPARTMENT ON MATTERS RELATED TO 

20:30:43 DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS AND SHE'S 
AVAILABLE IF NEEDED FOR 
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE PROJECT
20:30:46 .
THIS IS THE PROJECT WHERE YOU 
CAN SEE FROM
20:30:51  THE REPORT, THAT 
THE POLICE DEPARTMENT
20:30:54  GETS 
INVOLVED IN, YOU KNOW, QUESTIONS 
ABOUT ALCOHOL
20:30:57  SERVICE AND USES

20:31:03  ASK 
QUESTIONS OF STAFF SHE'S ONE OF 
THE STAFF.

20:31:06 >> Commissioner Yee:   OKAY, 
PERFECT BECAUSE YEAH, I SAW ON 
THE STAFF
20:31:09  REPORT THAT THERE 
HASN'T BEEN DMI REPORT
20:31:12 ED 
INCIDENCES FOR THIS PLACE
20:31:15  OF 
BUSINESS SINCE I THINK
20:31:18  IT WAS 
2019, IS THAT CORRECT?
>> IT
20:31:22  WAS 2017.
>> Commissioner Yee:  
20:31:25  OH EVEN 
FURTHER BAKE, 2017
20:31:28 .
BUT THAT'S A REPORTED FOR 
FREMONT POLICE
20:31:31  ACTUALLY HAS ON 
RECORD BECAUSE YOU KNOW, I DID 
HAVE A
20:31:34  CHANCE TO, I DON'T KNOW 
IF YOU KNOW BUT I HAD A CHANCE
20:31:37  
TO SPEAK WITH A NUMBER OF THE 
BUSINESSES IN THE AREA AND THEY 

20:31:40 DID SHARE WITH ME ABOUT A MONTH 
OR SO AK THAT THERE
20:31:44  WAS AN 
INCIDENT AT THAT PLACE OF
20:31:47  
BUSINESS, THERE WAS A GUNSHOT 
THAT WAS ACTUALLY FIRED
20:31:50  AND 
POLICE DID ARRIVE SO CAN YOU 
CLARIFY WITH ME IF THERE WAS
20:31:53  
SOMETHING LIKE THAT ABOUT A 
MONTH OR SO AGO
20:31:57 ?
20:32:05 
>> THERE IS NO REPORT OF THAT 
BUT LET ME DO ONE MORE CHECK
20:32:08  AND  
GET BACK TO YOU.
20:32:11 
>> Commissioner Yee:   I WAS 
TOLD THEY WERE TOLD TO CLOSE.

20:32:14 I HAVE BEEN THERE SEVERAL TIMES 
AND I HAVE NOT SEEN THE PLACE
20:32:17  
OPEN SO I'M TRYING TO GET 
CLARITY IF THIS
20:32:21  ESTABLISHMENT 
ACTUALLY HAD AN INCIDENT THERE 
OR NOT.

20:32:24 YOU KNOW LAST MONTH IT WAS 
PROBABLY
20:32:27  -- SOUNDS LIKE IT WAS 
NOT REPORTED
20:32:29 .
>> Planner Pullen:   IN ADDITION 
TO THE FEEDBACK FROM THE POLICE 

20:32:33 DEPARTMENT, THE APPLICANT HAS A 
CHANCE TO PRESENT, THE
20:32:36  APPLICANT 
MAY BE ABLE TO PROVIDE
20:32:39  MORE 
INFORMATION ON IF THERE WAS 
SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED IN THE
20:32:42  
VICINITY OR AT THE BUSINESS
20:32:45 .
BUT IF MICHELLE FROM POLICE 
DEPARTMENT
20:32:49  IS ABLE TO PROVIDE 
MORE INFORMATION THAT'S GREAT
20:32:52 .
>> Commissioner Yee:   OKAY.
>> Commissioner Daulton:  
20:32:55  SO 
CAN I DIRECT THAT
20:32:58  DIRECT AT THE 
ENCORE PLUS
20:33:01  REPRESENTATIVE?
IS THAT POSSIBLE?
>> Planner Pullen:  
20:33:04  I THINK IT 
WOULD BE APPROPRIATE TO HAVE 
THEM
20:33:08  PRESENT IF THERE ARE NO 
FURTHER INITIAL QUESTIONS OF
20:33:10  
STAFF.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   OKAY.

20:33:13 >> Commissioner Yee:   WAIT, I 
STILL.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   GO 

20:33:16 AHEAD.
>> Commissioner Yee:   STILL 
WAITING FOR POOR MICHELLE.

20:33:19 BECAUSE I KNOW IN THE STAFF 
REPORT THEY TALK ABOUT BEING 
ABLE
20:33:22  TO ONLY PROVIDE TO ALCOHOL 
OVER AT THE FRONT
20:33:25  DESK AND NOT 
INTO THOSE KARAOKE ROOMS.
20:33:28 
THE QUESTION I WANTED TO ASK IS 
HOW TO MAKE SURE
20:33:31  THAT THAT 
ENVIRONMENT DOES HAPPEN LIKE 
THAT.

20:33:34 HOW IS IT BEING MONITORED SO 
THAT
20:33:37  ALCOHOL, BEER AND WINE IS 
ONLY BEING DISTRIBUTED
20:33:40  AT THAT 
FRONT DESK AND FRONT DESK ONLY 
AND
20:33:43  NOT BEING BROUGHT INTO THOSE 
KARAOKE ROOMS
20:33:48 ?
20:33:50 
>> Commissioner Daulton:   IS 
YOUR QUESTION DIRECTED TO 

20:33:53 MICHELLE OR --
>> Commissioner Yee:   YES.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   THE 

20:33:56 APPLICANT?
>> Commissioner Yee:   IT WAS 
ACTUALLY DIRECTED TO MICHELLE 

20:33:59 BECAUSE I WANTED TO DETERMINE 
WHAT IS THE FREMONT POLICE, HOW 
DO THEY
20:34:02  MAKE SURE TO MONITOR 
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
>> Commissioner Daulton: 
20:34:05   I 
SEE, OKAY.
DO WE WANT TO --
20:34:08  OH SHE'S BACK.
OKAY.
>> SORRY I WAS TRYING TO READ
20:34:11  
THE INCIDENT THAT HE'S TALKING 
ABOUT
20:34:15 .
HANG ON A SEC.
LOOKS
20:34:19  LIKE JANUARY 23 AN 
INCIDENT OCCURRED.
20:34:22 
BUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS, IT WAS 
IN THE PARKING LOT SO
20:34:25  IT'S NOT 
DESIGNATED AS HAVING OCCURRED AT 
THAT INCIDENT
20:34:30 .
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
IT
20:34:33  WASN'T AT THAT PARTICULAR 
UNIT.
>> Commissioner Yee:   I 

20:34:36 UNDERSTAND.
>> THEY WERE JUST DISPATCHED TO 
THE PARKING LOT FOR
20:34:39  A SHOOTING.
I DON'T BELIEVE THEY FOUND 
ANYONE OR ANY VICTIM
20:34:44 .
20:34:50 
>> Commissioner Yee:   SO YOUR 
REPORT
20:34:53  DOESN'T CLARIFY IF IT 
EMANATED FROM THIS BUSINESS OR 
NOT
20:34:55 ?
>> I JUST FOUND THE INCIDENT 
DETAIL.

20:34:58 I NEED TO READ THE REPORT NOW
20:35:01 .
WHAT WAS THE QUESTION, I HEARD 
YOU ASK A QUESTION.

20:35:04 >> Commissioner Yee:   THE OTHER 
QUESTIONS I WANTED TO ASK THE 
STAFF
20:35:08  REPORT SAYS THE ALCOHOL IS 
TO BE DISTRIBUTED AT THE
20:35:11  FRONT 
DESK AND THE FRONT DESK ONLY.
HOW DO
20:35:15  WE ASSURE THAT IT'S ONLY 
GOING TO BE AT THE
20:35:18  FRONT DESK?
WHAT DO THE FREMONT POLICE DO, 
DO
20:35:21  THEY DO A SPOT INSPECTION,
20:35:24  
BECAUSE PART OF THE CONDITIONAL 
USE
20:35:27  IS, THAT IT IS AT THE FRONT 
DESK ONLY AND
20:35:31  NOT IN THOSE 
KARAOKE ROOMS.
>> THAT'S CORRECT.
20:35:34 
BUT MY UNDERSTANDING THAT 
WHOEVER PURCHASES THAT ALCOHOL 

20:35:37 CAN BRING IT TO THEIR ROOMS, IS 
THAT CORRECT?
>> Commissioner Yee:  
20:35:40  THAT'S 
RIGHT, YEAH, THEY PURCHASE IT AT 
THE FRONT DESK
20:35:44  AND THEY CAN 
BRING IT INTO THE ROOM.
>> OKAY,
20:35:47  NO WE DON'T TYPICALLY 
DO SPOT CHECKS.
IF
20:35:50  WE RECEIVED A COMPLAINT FROM 
THE LOCATION FOR
20:35:53  THINGS OUTSIDE 
OF COMPLIANCE WITH THEIR OWN 
PERMITTING
20:35:57  AND ABC LINES THEN WE
20:36:00  LICENSE WE 
WOULD
20:36:04  GO THERE AND INSPECT.
20:36:07 
>> Planner Pullen:   I CAN 
PROVIDE FOR THAT.
20:36:10 
WE ARE ABOUT DUE FOR A STENO 
BREAK IN THE
20:36:13  VERY NEAR FUTURE.
BUT I WANT THEM TO SAY THE 
CONDITIONS
20:36:16  REQUIRE THEM TO BE 
SERVED UP FRONT FOR THE PURPOSE 
OF THE
20:36:19  PERSON WHO'S SERVING THE 
ALCOHOL BEING ABLE
20:36:23  TO VIEW THE 
PERSON, SEE IF THEY'RE DRUNK AND
20:36:25  
DECIDE WHETHER TO REFUSE 
SERVICE.

20:36:28 IF THEY'RE IN A ROOM IT'S KIND 
OF HARD TO TELL
20:36:31 , BUNCH OF PEOPLE 
MAYBE, THEY BRING THE ALCOHOL
20:36:34  
AND IT'S NOT A GOOD SITUATION.
IT IS AN
20:36:38  ABC LICENSE IN THE END 
AND OUR CONDITION
20:36:41  OF APPROVAL 
BUT THE APPLICANT IS RESPONSIBLE 
TO ABC TO MAKE SURE
20:36:44  THAT THEY'RE 
DOING A VARIETY OF THINGS AND 
ONE OF THEM IS
20:36:47  NOT OVERSERVING 
PATRONS.
WE DON'T HAVE THE STAFF
20:36:51  AS A 
CITY POLICE DEPARTMENT OR ANY 
OTHER DIVISION TO BE AT
20:36:54  ANYPLACE 
OF BUSINESS THAT HAS AN ALCOHOL 
PERMIT AND THOSE
20:36:57  ARE ALWAYS 
COMPLAINT -- BASED AS IT WOULD 
BE IN THIS
20:37:00  CASE.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   THANK 
YOU,
20:37:03  JOEL, OKAY.
AT THIS TIME I THINK WE DO NEED 
TO TAKE A BREAK
20:37:07  HERE.
TRISH, CAN YOU GIVE US TEN 
MINUTES, IS THAT RIGHT
20:37:11 ?
>> YES, WE'LL GO AHEAD AND GIVE 
TEN MINUTES.
20:37:13 
>> Commissioner Daulton:   AND 
WHEN WE COME BACK WE CAN HEAR 

20:37:16 FROM THE APPLICANT I HOPE.
>> JUST A REMINDER IF
20:37:19  EVERYBODY 
COULD MUTE THEMSELVES AND TURN 
OFF
20:37:22  THEIR VIDEO WHILE WE'RE ON 
BREAK.
THANK YOU.

20:37:25 >> Commissioner Daulton:   THANK 
YOU TRISH.
[ RECESS ]
20:50:07 
>> Commissioner Liu:   CHAIR 
DAULTON,
20:50:10 .
>> Commissioner Daulton:   YES.
>> Commissioner Liu:   I'M SURE 

20:50:14 YOU WOULD APPROVE THE SIGN IF IT 
WAS
20:50:18  100 TIMES LARGER THAN THE 
SABERCAT
20:50:23  PROJECT RIGHT?
>> Commissioner Daulton:  
20:50:26  
COMMISSIONER LIU, I'M SURE I
20:50:29  
WOULD NOT, I WOULD
20:50:33  GET A COMMENT 
FROM HEATHER IF I DID.

20:50:36 >> Planner Pullen:   I THINK WE 
HAVE MOST OF THE COMMISSIONERS 
BACK.

20:50:39 I'M COUNTING.

20:50:44 >> Commissioner Daulton:   OKAY, 
ALL RIGHT.
SO LET'S
20:50:47  RECONVENE THIS MEETING.
AND IF IT'S OKAY, WITH THE 
COMMISSIONER
20:50:50 S, THEN I WOULD LIKE 
TO HEAR THERE THE APPLICANT
20:50:53 , 
MR. SHANKS.
CHAIR RECOGNIZES YOU
20:50:57 .
>> GOOD EVENING, CHAIRMAN
20:51:00 , 
CHAIRPERSON DAULTON.
20:51:03 
>> EXCUSE ME, HOW MANY MINUTES 
DOES HE HAVE?

20:51:06 >> Commissioner Daulton:   
APPLICANT HAS TEN MINUTES.
>> OKAY.

20:51:09 >> I WON'T TAKE TEN MINUTES.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR 
CONSIDERATION
20:51:12  TONIGHT.
I'M REPRESENTING
20:51:16  THE APPLICANT, 
I'M ROGER SHANK
20:51:19 , LAND USE 
CONSULTANT
20:51:22 , WORKING WITH THE 
APPLICANT.
THEY'RE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT 

20:51:26 MAKING THIS APPLICATION RUN 
SMOOTHLY.
THERE WERE PROBLEMS
20:51:29  IN THE PAST 
WITH A PREVIOUS RNL.

20:51:32  OWNER.
WORKING WITHIN
20:51:36  THE CONFINES OF 
THE COMMISSION.
THE
20:51:39  STAFF REPORT IS VERY 
COMPLETE.
SOME CONCERNS I'VE
20:51:43  BEEN HEAR IS 
THAT ON THE ALCOHOL THE SALES 
WOULD BE
20:51:46  OCCURRING AT THE FRONT 
DESK AND THEN THE PATRONS WOULD
20:51:49  
TAKE IT BACK TO THE INDIVIDUAL 
ROOMS.

20:51:52 THEY CANNOT DELIVER THE DRINKS 
BACK TO THOSE ROOMS.
AND
20:51:55  AS YOU SEE IN THE REPORT, 
ALL THE ROOMS HAVE TO
20:51:58  HAVE 
WINDOWS, SO THAT DESTINY 
ACTIVITY GOING ON WITHIN
20:52:02  THE 
KARAOKE ROOMS IS VISIBLE EASILY
20:52:04  
AND READILY FROM ANYBODY IN THE 
HALLWAY.

20:52:07 SO THE STAFF CAN DO THAT.
THERE
20:52:10  WILL ALWAYS BE TWO STAFF 
PERSONS ON
20:52:14  SITE AT EACH -- AT 
ANY ONE TIME.
A
20:52:17  MANAGER PLUS SOMEBODY ELSE.
AND THEY ALL HAVE TO BE OVER
20:52:21  21.
SO THEIR JOB IS TO MONITOR
20:52:25  THE 
OPERATION ITSELF TO MAKE SURE 
THAT IT IS RUN
20:52:28 NING SMOOTHLY.
ON YOUR CONDITION NUMBER A-
20:52:32 4, 
REVOCATION OF PERMIT, HAD
20:52:35  THE 
PROVISION IN THERE THAT IF THEY 
ARE NOT MEETING THE CONDITION
20:52:38  OF 
APPROVABILITY SUCH AS THE 
ALCOHOL DISTRIBUTION, THIS
20:52:41  CAN 
COME BACK FOR REVOCATION.
20:52:44 
 THEY ARE VERY WELL AWARE OF 
THAT
20:52:47  AND VERY INTERESTED IN 
MAKING THIS THING WORK.
THE ALCOHOL IS ADDED
20:52:50  FOR THE 
ENJOYMENT AND EXPANSION
20:52:55  OF THE 
USE FOR MORE PEOPLE TO ENJOY 
THIS KIND OF AN ACTIVITY
20:52:59 .
SO WE WOULD RESPECTFULLY REQUEST 
YOUR APPROVAL OF
20:53:02  THIS USE.
THE ONSITE MANAGER IS
20:53:05  WITH US 
TONIGHT IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO 
HEAR FROM HIM
20:53:10 .
>> Commissioner Daulton:  
20:53:11  YES, 
PLEASE.
GO AHEAD.

20:53:17 >> HI, I'M THE MANAGER
20:53:20  OF THE 
ENCORE.
ANY
20:53:23  QUESTION?
>> Commissioner Daulton:   WE 
COULD COME
20:53:26  BACK TO YOU WITH 
QUESTIONS.
20:53:30 
>> OKAY.
SO
20:53:33  I WANT TO SEND YOU, I
20:53:36  CAN 
COME BACK IF THERE IS ANYTHING I 
COULD TALK.

20:53:39 >> Commissioner Daulton:   OKAY 
SOUND GOOD, ALL RIGHT.
SO
20:53:42  MR. SHANKS IF YOU ARE DONE I 
WILL GO BACK TO THE 
COMMISSIONERS.
20:53:45 
>> KEEP THIS SHORT AND SWEET.
THERE IS NO NEED TO ELABORATE ON
20:53:48  
THAT.
I DON'T WANT TO SPEND TEN 

20:53:51 MINUTES WASTING YOUR TIME.
SO YEAH, I'LL PUT IT BACK TO 
YOU.
20:53:52 
>> Commissioner Daulton:   ALL 
RIGHT.

20:53:55 COMMISSIONERS, DO YOU HAVE 
QUESTIONS FOR THE APPLICANT?

20:53:58 BEN YEE, COMMISSIONER YEE, 
PLEASE.
>> Commissioner Yee:   YOU HEARD
20:54:02  
ME EARLIER ASKING A QUESTION 
ABOUT THIS
20:54:05  INCIDENT, THAT NOW WE 
KNOW WAS
20:54:08  ON JANUARY 24th.
DO YOU KNOW DESTINY DETAILS AS 
TO
20:54:11  WHAT TRANSPIRED ON THAT 
24th THAT ACCORDING TO THE 
OTHER
20:54:14  BUSINESSES HAPPENED IN AND 
AROUND THE VICINITY
20:54:17  OF YOUR 
PLACE OF BUSINESS
20:54:21 ?

20:54:25 >> BEN, CAN YOU ANSWER THAT 
QUESTION?
I DON'T HAVE THE ANNALS ON
20:54:28  THAT 
ONE.
>> YES, SURE
20:54:32 .
UP ON THAT DAY, ONE OF OUR 
CUSTOMER WAS LEAVING
20:54:35  AND IT WAS 
ARGUING IF A
20:54:38  CUSTOMER WAS IN THE 
PARKING LOT.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY FIGHTING 

20:54:41 ABOUT, I HEAR THE GUNSHOT, AND A 
COP JUST COME,
20:54:44  I DON'T HAVE MUCH 
DETAIL FOR THAT ONE.
BUT
20:54:47  GUNSHOT IS ON THE PARKING 
LOT IS NOT ONLY A CUSTOMER
20:54:50  AND 
SOMEONE ELSE FROM ALL THE PEOPLE
20:54:53 
PEOPLE.
>> Commissioner Yee:   OKAY SO 

20:54:57 YOU'RE CORROBORATING WITH WHAT I 
WAS TOLD BY THE BUSINESS OWNERS 
IN THE AREA
20:55:00  THAT IT WAS 
EMANATING FROM ONE OF YOUR 
CUSTOMERS
20:55:03 .
I GUESS
20:55:06  THE OTHER THING IS THAT 
I WAS ALSO TOLD THAT
20:55:09  WHEN THE 
POLICE ARRIVED
20:55:13  AND ASCERTAINED 
THE SITUATION, THE OTHER
20:55:17  
BUSINESS OWNERS TOLD ME THAT 
YOUR PLACE OF BUSINESS WAS TO BE
20:55:19  
TEMPORARILY CLOSED.
IS THAT CURRENTLY THE STATE 

20:55:23 RIGHT NOW, OR ARE YOU BACK UP 
AND IN
20:55:26  OPERATIONS AND OPEN 
AGAIN?
>> 
20:55:29 WE ARE TEMPORARILY CLOSED BUT 
NOT
20:55:32  BECAUSE -- WE HAVE TO UPDATE 
OUR SERVER.
20:55:35 
IT IS NOT BECAUSE WE ARE 
TEMPORARILY CLOSED BY THE POLICE
20:55:37 
POLICE.
>> Commissioner Yee:   OKAY, 

20:55:40 OKAY, THAT WOULD EXPLAIN WHY I 
WENT THERE A COUPLE OF TIMES, AS 
A MATTER OF FACT
20:55:43  I WENT LIKE 
AROUND 10:30 AT NIGHT
20:55:46  THINKING 
THAT YOU WOULD BE OPEN AND OF 
COURSE YOU WERE CLOSED
20:55:49 .
OKAY THANK YOU.
>> YEAH, BECAUSE ONE OF MY 

20:55:52 EMPLOYEE WAS SICK AND IT'S A 
CHINESE NEW YEAR SO
20:55:55  I HAVE TO GO 
TO ANOTHER STATE TO BE WITH MY
20:55:58  
FAMILY SO THAT IS WHY WE ARE 
CLOSING ALSO FOR THE UP
20:56:01 DATE FOR 
SERVER.
>> Commissioner Yee:   OKAY, ALL 

20:56:04 RIGHT, THANK YOU.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   ANY
20:56:06  
OTHER QUESTIONS FROM 
COMMISSIONERS?

20:56:12 I DO SEE THAT MICHELLE HAS HER 
HAND RAISED
20:56:15 .
MICHELLE DID YOU WANT TO 
COMMENT?

20:56:18 DID YOU READ THAT REPORT?
20:56:22 
>> YES, I READ AS MUCH AS I 
COULD.

20:56:25 IT'S A LOT TO READ.
THE INCIDENT OCCURRED ON JANUARY
20:56:28  
23rd, 2022 AT ABOUT 1:00 IN 
THE MORNING
20:56:32 .
INITIAL REPORTS OF A SHOOTING IN 
THE PARKING
20:56:35  LOT.
THE OFFICERS DID RESPOND, AND
20:56:38  
DETERMINED THAT IT WAS 
ASSOCIATED TO THE BUSINESS
20:56:42 .
AND CONDUCTED A SEARCH OF INSIDE 
THE
20:56:45  BUSINESS AND LOCATED 
EVIDENCE THAT THE GUNSHOTS
20:56:49  
OCCURRED BOTH WITHIN AND OUTSIDE 
THE BUSINESS
20:56:52 , AND FOUND EVIDENCE 
OF
20:56:55  DRINKING ALREADY OCCURRING IN
20:56:58  
MULTIPLE ROOMS.
AND
20:57:02  THEN
20:57:08  HAD TO CONTACT AN 
EMPLOYEE ONSITE THAT WAS FOUND
20:57:11  
TO BE UNDER THE INFLUENCE AND 
ARRESTED.
20:57:13 
>> Commissioner Daulton:   ALL 
RIGHT.

20:57:16 COMMISSIONER LIU DID YOU HAVE 
YOUR HAND RAISED?
>> Commissioner Liu:   YES I DID
20:57:19 
DID.
I WAS GOING TO ASK
20:57:23  MR. TAM, DID 
YOU HAVE ANY PREVIOUS
20:57:26  EXPERIENCE 
RUNNING ANOTHER
20:57:30  RESTAURANT OR 
SOME KARAOKE THAT ACTUALLY
20:57:33  
SERVED ALCOHOL?
>> NO.

20:57:36 I HAVE BEEN WORKING AT
20:57:39  
RESTAURANT BEFORE BUT THEY DON'T 
SERVE ALCOHOL.

20:57:42 THIS IS MY FIRST TIME TO RUN A 
KARAOKE
20:57:45 .
>> Commissioner Liu:   OKAY.
SO ARE YOU AWARE OF THE
20:57:49  BEST 
PRACTICES IN YOU KNOW CHECKING 
OUT
20:57:52  ON THE CUSTOMERS TO MAKE 
SURE THEY ARE
20:57:55  NOT DRUNK?
AND
20:57:58  THEN AT WHAT POINT IN TIME 
DO YOU KNOW HOW TO STOP SERVING 
ALCOHOL TO
20:58:02  THEM?
AND WHETHER YOU
20:58:05  HAVE PROCEDURES 
TO
20:58:09  STOP THEM FROM GETTING HARMED
20:58:14  
OR HARMING OTHERS, SUCH AS, YOU 
KNOW, MAYBE TAKING
20:58:17  THEIR KEYS?

20:58:20 IF THEY WANT TO DRINK ANY 
FURTHER?
20:58:23 
>> YES.
NORMALLY, WE HAVE TWO PEOPLE 

20:58:27 WORKING AT ONE SHIFT.
BUT I SAY MY
20:58:30  CO-WORKER WAS SICK 
AND THEY HAVE BEEN GONE
20:58:33  FOR A 
WEEK BY COVID.
THAT'S WHY IT'S ONLY PERSON
20:58:37  
WORKING THAT NIGHT.
AND WE HAVE A WINDOW FOR
20:58:40  EVERY 
OF THE ROOMS SO WE ARE KEEP 
CHECKING
20:58:43  THE HALLWAY AND MAKE 
SURE PEOPLE IS DOING OKAY IN THE
20:58:46  
ROOM.
AND MY PEOPLE BEGIN TO YELLING
20:58:49  
OR FIGHTING, MAYBE ABOUT TO 
FIGHT, WE WILL GO
20:58:53  IN AND STOP 
THEM AND JUST
20:58:56  CUT THEIR ROOM.
WE ALSO PROVIDE
20:59:00  WE WILL CALL 
UBER FOR THEM IF THEY ARE TOO 
DRUNK
20:59:04 .
>> Commissioner Daulton:   ALL 
RIGHT.

20:59:07 COMMISSIONER ZHANG.
QUESTION FOR APPLICANT?
>> Commissioner Zhang:   I JUST
20:59:10  
WANT TO CLARIFY FOR MICHELLE
20:59:14 , IS 
THE INCIDENT HAPPENED AT 1 A.M.
20:59:18 ?
>> THAT'S CORRECT.
20:59:20 
>> Commissioner Zhang:   IS THE 
BUSINESS HOUR OF THE SITE 

20:59:24 SUPPOSED TO BE MIDNIGHT, 12?
20:59:27 
>> THAT'S NOT IN THE REPORT.
I'M NOT SURE.

20:59:30 >> Commissioner Zhang:   CAN 
OWNER CLARIFY THIS?
20:59:33 
>> YES, WE CLOSE AT 12, WE ARE 
CLOSING UP
20:59:37  AT 12:30.
BY THAT TIME ALL PEOPLE WAS
20:59:40  GO, 
ALL PEOPLE WAS NO ONE IN THE
20:59:43  
KARAOKE ALREADY.
EVERYONE WAS IN THE PARKING LOT 

20:59:46 AND SOME OF THEM WAS FIGHTING.
I WAS CLEANING UP
20:59:49  THE ROOM BY 
THAT TIME.
20:59:50 
>> Commissioner Liu:   ALL 
RIGHT, THANK YOU.

20:59:55 >> Commissioner Daulton:   ALL 
RIGHT.
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS?

20:59:58 COMMISSIONER YEE, YES.
>> Commissioner Yee:  
21:00:02  THIS IS 
IN RELATION TO WHAT
21:00:05  THE OFFICER 
SAID?
IS THAT THEY DETERMINED THAT 

21:00:09 SOME OF THESE PATRONS HAD
21:00:12  
ALCOHOL.
AND I GUESS TO MR. TAM, THE 

21:00:16 QUESTION IS FIRST OF ALL, HOW 
DID THEY OBTAIN IT?
AND IF YOU
21:00:19  DON'T HAVE AN ALCOHOL
21:00:22 
ALCOHOL, I MEAN A BEER AND WINE 
LICENSE, THE QUESTION
21:00:25  FOR ME 
WOULD BE WHY ARE YOU LETTING 
THESE CLIENTS
21:00:29  OR I MEAN THESE 
CUSTOMERS IN WITH ACCESSIBILITY 
TO ALCOHOL
21:00:33 ?

21:00:37 >> YES, THAT'S NOT MY FAULT THAT 
NIGHT BECAUSE
21:00:40  IT IS ONLY ONE 
PERSON, WE HAVE A BACK DOOR
21:00:43  OPEN 
AND SOME OF THEM MISTAKE BUT
21:00:46  NOT 
TOO MUCH.
>> Commissioner Yee:  
21:00:48  OKAY.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   ALL 
RIGHT.

21:00:51 IF THE APPLICANT HAS ANYTHING 
ELSE TO SAY, WOULD YOU LIKE TO 
GIVE
21:00:54  US A SUM-UP?

21:00:59 >> YES.
I THINK THE
21:01:02  OPERATION, I THINK 
THEY NEED TO BE WELL AWARE OF 
THE FACT THAT
21:01:05  THEY DO HAVE 
RESTRICTIONS.
ON HOW TO RUN
21:01:09  THIS THING.
AND GOING THROUGH
21:01:12  THIS I THINK 
THEY ARE GOING TO BE FOLLOWING 
THE REGULATIONS
21:01:15 , CLOSING TO THE 
PUBLIC BY MIDNIGHT AND CONTROL 
THE
21:01:18  ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE SERVICE 
AND NOT ALLOWING ALCOHOL TO BE 
BROUGHT
21:01:22  IN FROM THE OUTSIDE.
A
21:01:25  PATRON CANNOT BRING THEIR OWN 
ALCOHOL IN.
IT IS RESTRICT
21:01:28 ED TO SALE ONSITE 
ONLY.
AND I THINK THEY ARE
21:01:31  GOING TO BE 
FOLLOWING THE REGULATION BECAUSE 
THEY KNOW THEY CAN BE
21:01:34  SHUT DOWN 
IF THEY DON'T.
AND THIS IS AN OPERATION THAT 

21:01:38 WILL BE OF BENEFIT TO THE 
COMMUNITY.
21:01:41 
ENHANCING THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR 
ENTERTAINMENT
21:01:45  AND ENJOYMENT FOR 
CITIZENS OF FREMONT.
SO I WOULD
21:01:48  RESPECTFULLY REQUEST 
A VOTE OF APPROVAL
21:01:50  FOR THIS 
PROJECT.
THANK YOU.

21:01:53 >> Commissioner Daulton:   THANK 
YOU, MR. SHANKS
21:01:56 .
NOW THIS IS THE TIME IN WHICH WE 
ASK
21:01:59  FOR HEARING PUBLIC COMMENTS.
TRISH DO WE HAVE ANY PUBLIC 
COMMENTS
21:02:02  ON THIS ITEM?
21:02:06 
>> CHAIR DAULTON, WE DO NOT HAVE 
ANY RAISED HANDS FOR
21:02:08  ANYONE 
ASKING TO SPEAK TONIGHT.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   ALL 

21:02:11 RIGHT, THANK YOU.
SO
21:02:14  I'D LIKE TO CLOSE THE PUBLIC 
MEETING
21:02:18  AT THIS TIME.

NOT BE
21:02:34  RELEVANT BUT
21:02:38  WE DO GIVE 
THE APPLICANT
21:02:41  A CHANCE TO REBUT.
I'M GUESSING THEY DO
21:02:44  NOT.
DO THEY NEED THE FIVE MINUTES?
YOU COULD
21:02:47  ASK.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   I 
BELIEVE I JUST GAVE THEM THE
21:02:51  
CHANCE TO SUM UP.
21:02:53 
MR. SHANKS DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING 
ADDITIONAL TO SAY?

21:02:56 >> NO I DON'T, THANK YOU.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   
COMMISSIONERS, IF
21:03:00  THERE ARE ANY 
COMMENTS ON THIS OR I WOULD ALSO 
LIKE A MOTION.
21:03:03 
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO
21:03:05 ?
COMMISSIONER YEE?
>> Commissioner Yee:   YES, 

21:03:08 WOULD I LIKE TO MAKE A MOTION TO 
DENY THIS
21:03:11  CONDITIONAL USE 
PERMIT.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   CAN
21:03:15  I 
GET A SECOND?
21:03:17 
>> Commissioner Steckler:   I'LL 
SECOND.

21:03:21 >> Commissioner Daulton:   DO WE 
CALL A VOTE?

21:03:26 JOEL
21:03:28  
WILL YOU CALL A VOTE.
>> Planner Pullen:   WILL DO.

21:03:31 ONE MOMENT.
21:03:38 
ALL RIGHT SO WHEN I CALL YOUR 
NAME ON A MOTION
21:03:41  BY COMMISSIONER 
YEE, SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER 
STECKLER.
21:03:45 
TO DENY THE APPLICATION.
PLEASE STATE YOUR VOTE
21:03:48 .
CHAIR DAULTON.
AYE
21:03:52 .
VICE CHAIR RAO, AYE
21:03:55 .
COMMISSIONER YEE.
AYE
21:03:58 .
COMMISSIONER STECKLER.
AYE
21:04:01 .
COMMISSIONER LIU.
AYE
21:04:05 .
AND COMMISSIONER ZHANG.
AYE.

21:04:08 ALL RIGHT SO THE VOTE IS 
UNANIMOUS.
THE PROJECT'S
21:04:12  BEEN DENIED.
THE PLANNING COMMISSION'S ACTION 
ON THIS ITEM
21:04:15  IS FINAL UNLESS 
APPEALED TO THE CITY COUNCIL 
WITHIN TEN CALENDAR DAYS
21:04:18 .
CHAIR, I DO WANT TO JUST NOTE.
I
21:04:22  WAS SURPRISED AT THE 
INFORMATION THAT WAS SHARED 
DURING THE HEARING
21:04:24 .
>> Commissioner Daulton:   AS 
WAS I.

21:04:27 >> Planner Pullen:   THE TIME 
FRAME FOR REVIEW OF A REPORT 
TAKES
21:04:31  US THROUGH INTO JANUARY, 
AND RIGHT
21:04:35  UP TO THE WEEK BEFORE 
THE MEETING
21:04:38 .
AND IT APPEARS THAT THE 
ADDITIONAL
21:04:41  INFORMATION HAPPENED 
RELATIVELY SOON BEFORE THE 
MEETING.

21:04:44 NOW, COMPOUNDING THAT, I JUST 
WANT
21:04:49  TO BE -- TO SAY THIS 
BECAUSE MICHELLE IS NEW TO OUR
21:04:52  
REVIEW.
THE
21:04:55  PREVIOUS REVIEWER FOR POLICE 
DEPARTMENT
21:04:59  WAS TRANSITIONING 
OVER TO MICHELLE AND HAD
21:05:02  
RECENTLY LEFT THE CITY.
AND SO THROUGH A VARIETY OF 

21:05:05 FACTORS, I THINK THAT VERY 
LATE-BREAKING REPORT DIDN'T
21:05:08  MAKE 
ITS WAY TO
21:05:11  OUR AND YOUR HANDS.
SO I'M GLAD WE GOT THE 
INFORMATION,
21:05:15  WAS ABLE TO INFORM 
YOUR
21:05:19  DELIBERATION, AND WE WILL 
ALWAYS TRY TO GET YOU
21:05:22  THE MOST 
21:05:24  
RELEVANT AND QUICK INFORMATION.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   THANK 

21:05:28 YOU TO THE INDEFATIGABLE
21:05:33  
COMMISSIONER YEE FOR FERRETING 
OUT THOSE ITEMS
21:05:37 .
I'D LIKE TO MOVE ON
21:05:40  TO 
MISCELLANEOUS ITEMS.
DO WE HAVE ANYTHING FROM STAFF?

21:05:43 >> Planner Pullen:   THE ONE 
UPDATE I WANT TO GIVE IS YOU'LL 
BE
21:05:46  RECEIVING AN E-MAIL TOMORROW 
ASKING IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO 
ATTEND
21:05:49  THE P PLANNING 
COMMISSIONERS ACADEMY TRAINING
21:05:52  
THAT'S HAPPENING IN SAN
21:05:56  RAMON ON 
MARCH 16th THROUGH 18th AND 
IF SO THEN ALL
21:05:59  YOU HAVE TO DO IS 
LET TRISH KNOW AND WE'LL GO 
AHEAD
21:06:03  AND REGISTER YOU.
IT IS AN IN-PERSON COMMITMENT
21:06:06 .
THOUGH IT'S VERY CLOSE AND SO 
NEAR YOUR
21:06:09  HOME.
AND SO IF YOU'RE COMFORTABLE 
WITH THAT THEN YOU
21:06:12  ARE ABLE TO 
ATTEND THAT.
AND
21:06:15  THE CITY REALLY ENCOURAGES 
YOU TO LEARN THE NEW
21:06:18 EST 
INFORMATION ABOUT STATE LAWS AND
21:06:21  
SORT OF
21:06:24  HOW COMMISSIONS OPERATE 
FOR THE NEW
21:06:28  COMMISSIONER THAT 
WILL BE A REALLY GOOD TIME AND 
GOOD
21:06:32  REFRESHER FOR OTHERS IF 
THEY'RE SO INTERESTED.
21:06:36 
THAT CONCLUDES MY UPSTAIRS.
21:06:39  UPDATES
21:06:42 .
>> Commissioner Daulton:   WHERE 
IS THAT JOEL?

21:06:45 >> Planner Pullen:   SAN A
21:06:48  RAMON
21:06:52 .
>> Commissioner Daulton:   ANY
21:06:56  
DOCUMENTS FROM COMMISSIONERS?
I WOULD LIKE TO CONCLUDE
21:06:59  BY
