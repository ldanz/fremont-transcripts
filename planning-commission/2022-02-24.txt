19:21:40 ED PLANS LIKE THE GLOBE PLAN DISTRICT
19:21:44  AND PACIFIC COMMONS ARE SHOWN IN  RED.
AS CAN YOU SEE THE PROJECT SITE
19:21:47  IS BOUNDED ON THREE SIDES BY INDUSTRIALLY
19:21:51  DESIGNATED LANDS AND IS LOCATED WITHIN ANNAL AREA OF DENSELY
19:21:54  INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT BY
19:21:58  I-880, STEPHENSON BOULEVARD AND AUTO
MALL PARKWAY
19:22:01 .
THIS SLIDE TAKES A FINER VIEW OF THE IMMEDIATE AREA AND SHOWS
19:22:04  A DESIGNATIONS EVER PROPERTIES AROUND THE PROJECT
19:22:07  SITE.
SERVICE AND TECH INDUSTRIAL
19:22:10  DESIGNATED AREAS SURROUND THE SIDE ON THREE SIDES
19:22:14  AND WALMART ACROSS ALBRAE STREET AND
19:22:17  THE DEVELOPED PORTIONS OF THE GLOBE ADJACENT TO THE SITE
19:22:21  ON STEPHENSON BOULEVARD
CARRY
19:22:24  COMMERCIAL DESIGNATIONS.
INDUSTRIAL PROPERTIES ARE DEVELOPED
19:22:27  WITH MANUFACTURING, LIGHT INDUSTRIAL AND WHOLESALE
19:22:31  DISTRIBUTION USES AND THE COMMERCIAL PARCELS ARE DEVELOPED WITH WALMART
19:22:35  AS MENTIONED AND THE DEVELOPED WITH
19:22:38 
PERSONAL SERVICE USES.
HERE
19:22:41  IS THE SITE PLAN FOR PROPOSED PROJECT.
IT CONSISTS
19:22:45  OF THREE BUILDINGS, THE TWO LARGEST OF WHICH ARE LOCAT
19:22:48 ED ON THE SOUTHEAST PORTION OF THE SITE.
A THIRD SMALLER
19:22:51  BUILDING IS LOCATED ON THE  NORTH-NORTHWESTERN
19:22:55  PORTION OF THE SITE.
NO SPECIFIC USES ARE PROPOSED FOR EACH BUILDING
19:22:59  BUT THEY ARE DESIGNED AS FLEXIBLE SPACES THAT COULD ACCOMMODATE
19:23:02  FUTURE ADVANCE MANUFACTURING, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT,
19:23:05  E-COMMISSIONER FULFILLMENT AND
19:23:09 
WAREHOUSE USES AS INDICATED
19:23:13 .
INDUSTRIAL USES IN VICINITY OF THE SITE AND ALSO CONSISTENT
19:23:17  WITH THE IT ZONING DISTRICT WHICH IS HOW
19:23:21  THE DISTRICT IS ZONED AFTER, AND IN EFFECT FOR
19:23:24  SITE SHOULD THE PROJECT BE APPROVED.
THE PROJECT WILL HAVE TWO
19:23:27  ACCESS DRIVES OFF ALBRAE STREET, THE PRIMARY
19:23:30  OF WHICH WILL BE ALIGNED WITH THE DRIVEWAY OF
19:23:33  WALMART AND THIS INTERSECTION WOULD BE SIGNALIZED.
AND
19:23:37  THE PROJECT ALSO FEATURES ACCESS DRIVES
19:23:40  OFF ENCYCLOPEDIA CIRCLE.
TWO OF WHICH ARE
19:23:43  SIZED FOR TRUCK INGRESS EGRESS AND
19:23:47  ONE SMALLER SITE IN THE CENTER OF THE SITE WHICH IS
19:23:50  DESIGNED FOR
19:23:54  PASSENGER TRAFFIC.
DIRECT ACCESS TO STEPHENSON BOULEVARD VIA
19:23:58  AN INTERIOR DRIVE THAT CUTS THROUGH THE PORTIONS OF THE
19:24:02  GLOBE.
19:24:05 
ALL TRAFFIC WOULD HAVE TO USE
19:24:09  ENCYCLOPEDIA CIRCLE ACCESS POINTS.
THEY WOULD BE PROHIBITED
19:24:12  TO USE ALBRAE DRIVE AND CONNECTION
19:24:16  TO STEPHENSON BOULEVARD.
NOW I WILL BRIEFLY GO THROUGH THE ELEVATION
19:24:19 S AND DETAILS OF EACH OF THE THREE PROJECT BUILDINGS
19:24:22 .
BUILDING 1 WOULD BE THE LARGEST OF THE THREE
19:24:26  PROJECT BUILDINGS.
IT WOULD HAVE FRONTAGE ON ALBRAE TREAT
19:24:29  AND ITS TRUCK COURT AREA WOULD BE LOCATED ON
19:24:32  ITS BACK SIDE AND SCREENED FROM ADJACENT PROPERTIES.
19:24:36 
THE PRIMARY ALBRAE STREET ELEVATION IS THE TOP IMAGE.
19:24:39 
THE BUILDING HAS BEEN DESIGNED TO PRESENT AN INTERESTING AND REFINED
19:24:42  FACE WITH CORNER ELEMENTS CREATING A SENSE OF INTEREST AND LANDMARK
19:24:46 ING THE LOCATIONS OF THE BUILDING'S
19:24:49  LIKELY ENTRANCE LOBBY AND
OFFICE AREAS.
19:24:52 
THIS DESIGN THEME IS CARRIED ON THROUGHOUT THE PROJECT AND
19:24:55  STAFF HAS FOUND THE PROJECT AND BUILDING DESIGN TO BE CONSISTENT
19:24:58  WITH THE CITYWIDE DESIGN GUIDELINES FOR INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT
19:25:03 .
BUILDING 2 IS SHAPED
19:25:06  AND  ORIENTED MUCH LIKE BUILDING 1 BUT
19:25:09  WITH ITS FACE TURNED TOWARDS
19:25:13  SCHOAP
19:25:17  ENCYCLOPEDIA CIRCLE AS WELL.
19:25:20 
TRUCK COURTS HIDDEN FROM VIEW.

19:25:24 BUILDING 3 IS MUCH SMALLER THAN THE OTHER TWO
19:25:27  BUILDINGS AND IS TAILORED MORE TO A RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT US
19:25:30 ER.
IT FEATURES A
19:25:34  SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF FENESTRATION ALONG
19:25:37  THE ALBRAE STREET ELEVATION WHICH IS THE POP IMAGE
19:25:41  AND ALSO CARRIES THROUGH WITH THE CONTEMPORARY
19:25:44  LOOK OF THE PROJECT.
HERE ARE A COUPLE OF RENDERING
19:25:48 S OF THE PROJECT.
THE TOP IMAGE IS A VIEW
19:25:51  OF BUILDING 2 AS SEEN FROM ENCYCLOPEDIA
19:25:54  CIRCLE.
AND THE BOTTOM IMAGE IS A VIEW
19:25:58  OF THE PROJECT FROM ALBRAE STREET WITH
19:26:02  BUILDING 1 OFTEN THE LEFT SIDE
19:26:05  AND BUILDING THREE ON THE LEFT SIDE.
19:26:08 
SIDEWALKS WOULD BE EXPANDED AND UPGRADED TO
19:26:12  BE DESIGNED TO CITY STANDARDS INCLUDING THE DEVELOPMENT OF CITY
19:26:15  TREES AND 25 FOOT WIDE FULLY LANDSCAPED
19:26:19  AREAS THAT WOULD FURTHER SERVE TO ENHANCE THE LOOK
19:26:23 
OF PROJECT FRONTAGES AND CONNECT THE SITE
19:26:26  TO ITS ADJACENT NEIGHBORS.
19:26:29 
A GENERAL PLAN AMENDMENT WOULD BE NECESSARY TO PERMIT A REZONING OF THE 
19:26:33 SITE FOR INDUSTRIAL USE.
THE GENERAL PLAN AMENDMENT
19:26:36  PROPOSED WOULD REDESIGNATE THE SITE FOR REGION COMMERCIAL
19:26:40  REGIONAL INDUSTRIAL
19:26:44 , TECH INDUSTRIAL, THAT THE
19:26:47  PROJECT SITE LIES WITHIN.
THE PROJECT'S PUBLIC
19:26:50  IMPROVEMENTS INCLUDE ALL NEW SIDEWALKS AND PARK WAYS LONG THE
19:26:54  STREET FRONTAGES, A WIDENING OF THE
19:26:58  ENCYCLOPEDIA ROADWAY AND
19:27:02  THE ENCYCLOPEDIA CIRCLE STEPHENSON
19:27:06  BOULEVARD
INTERSECTION WHICH WOULD HANDLE THE TRUCK TRAFFIC, AS WELL AS
19:27:09  A DEVELOPER COMMITMENT PLEDGE OF $500,000
19:27:12  THAT COULD BE USED FOR  FURTHERING CITY INITIATIVES AT THE DISCRETION
19:27:15  OF THE CITY COUNCIL.
AN ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
19:27:19  WAS PREPARED BY A LOCAL ECONOMIST, STRATEGIC
19:27:22  ECONOMICS FOR THE PROJECT.
THIS ANALYSIS WAS PROVIDED IN THE
19:27:26  HEARING PACKETS AND SUMMARIZED IN THE STAFF REPORT AND IT CONCLUDED
19:27:30  THAT THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES TO DEVELOPING
19:27:33  NEW RETAIL COMMERCIAL AT THE SITE AND THAT
DEMAND FOR
19:27:37  INDUSTRIAL SPACE IN THE CITY AND IN THE REGION IS EXTREMELY
19:27:40  HIGH, WHICH POINTS TO THE PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT BEING WELL  POSITIONED
19:27:43  TO QUICKLY ATTRACT TENANTS, BRING JOBS
19:27:46  TO A SITE
THAT CURRENTLY PROVIDES NONE AND REVENUES TO THE CITY
19:27:49 .
THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT HAS
19:27:52  REVIEWED AND CONCURRED WITH THE REPORT  FINDINGS AND
19:27:56  THE ANALYSIS AND HAS EXPRESSED SUPPORT FOR THE PROPOSED PROJECT.
19:27:59 
THE AUTHORS OF THE ECONOMIC ANALYSIS ARE HERE THIS EVENING
19:28:02  TO ANSWER QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE ABOUT THAT REPORT
19:28:06 .
IN ORDER TO DEVELOP THE PROJECT, A REZONING IS ALSO
19:28:09  NECESSARY.
THE REQUESTED REZONING WOULD CHANGE
19:28:12  THE ZONING OF THE SITE FROM THE GLOBE'S PLANNED DISTRICT TO A NEW PLANNED
19:28:16  DISTRICT THAT WOULD BE BASED OFF THE LAND USE
19:28:19  AND DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS OF THE I.T. ZONE.
NO
19:28:22  EXCEPTIONS TO I.T. ZONE LAND USE STANDARDS ARE PROPOSED AND FUTURE LAND USE AND
19:28:26  DEVELOPMENT WOULD BE SUBJECT TO I.T. ZONE REGULATIONS PER THE
19:28:29  PROPOSED PLAN DISTRICT GUIDELINES.
THE PLAN
19:28:32  DISTRICT DESIGN IS ONE THAT CONTEXTUAL
19:28:36 LY FITS WITHIN THE SITE AND MIDDLES
19:28:39  THROUGH SITE DESIGN MEASURES AND TRUCK ACCESS TO THE SITE
19:28:44 .
THE SITE WOULD BE SUBDIVIDED
19:28:47  INTO THREE LOTS AS SHOWN WITH THE RED PROPERTY LINES ON THE SCREEN
19:28:51 .
EACH BUILDING WOULD SIT ON THEIR OWN LOT.

19:28:54 PLOTTING IS CONSISTENT
19:28:57  WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE I.T. ZONE AND EASEMENTS FOR CROSS
19:29:01  LOT ACCESS AND CIRCULATION WOULD BE  RECORDED.

19:29:07 IN ADDENDUM TO THE PREVIOUSLY
19:29:10  CERTIFIED EIR AND SUPPLEMENTAL EIR FOR THE GLOBE'S GENERAL PLAN
19:29:14  AMENDMENT AND PLANNED DISTRICT REZONING HAS BEEN PLANNED FOR THE PROJECT
19:29:17 .
AN ADDENDUM WAS FOUND BECAUSE IT WAS FOUND
19:29:20  THAT IMPACTS FROM THE PROPOSED PROJECT
19:29:23  WOULD BE THE SAME OR LESS THAN THE IMPACTS IDENTIFIED
19:29:27  IN THE PREVIOUS CEQA ANALYSIS FOR BUILDOUT OF THE PERFORM
19:29:30  FORMER
PROJECT.

19:29:33 NO NEW SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS WOULD RESULT AND NO
19:29:36  NEW MITIGATION WAS FOUND NECESSARY.
PRIOR MITIGATION
19:29:40  MEASURES APPLICABLE TO THE PROJECT HAVE BEEN CARRIED OVER AND
19:29:43  INCLUDED IN THE PROJECT'S CONDITIONS OF PROGRAM
19:29:48  APPROVAL.
YESTERDAY THE TEAMSTERS
19:29:51  FILED, THE CITY'S
19:29:56  ENVIRONMENTAL CONSULTANT HAS PREPARED A RESPONSE
19:30:00  LETTER, ADDENDUM FOR THE PROJECT AND NO FURTHER
19:30:03  ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW BEING NECESSARY.
THE TEAMSTERS LETTER AND
19:30:06  THE CONSULTANT ANSWER RESPONSE LETTER WERE UPLOADED
19:30:09  TO THE  CITY'S WEBSITE THIS AFTERNOON.
ADDITIONALLY AS
19:30:13  JOEL ALSO MENTIONED A LETTER WAS RECEIVED THIS EVENING ON BEHALF
19:30:16  OF THE SIERRA CLUB.
THE ITEM WAS RECEIVED TOO LATE
19:30:19  FOR PREPARATION OF A SPONGES BUT BASED ON INITIAL REVIEW
19:30:22  IT  ARGUES AGAINST PREPARATION OF A MITIGATED NEGATIVE
19:30:26  DECLARATION AND NOT AN ADDENDUM WHICH
19:30:29  IS APPROACHED
FOR THIS PROJECT AND THUS A STANDARD OF LEGAL REVIEW
19:30:33  IS DIFFERENT THAN WHAT'S APPLICABLE TO THE PROJECT AND THE LETTER ALSO
19:30:36  DOES NOT PRESENT SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE THAT PREPARATION OF
19:30:39  A SUBSEQUENT OR
SUPPLEMENTAL EIR WOULD BE REQUIRED UNDER
19:30:43  CEQA GUIDELINES.
REBECCA IS HERE TONIGHT TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT
19:30:46  THE ADDENDUM AND ARGUMENTS RAISED IN THESE PIECES OF
19:30:50  CORRESPONDENCE.
STAFF SUPPORTS THE
19:30:53  PROJECT FOR REASONS MENTIONED AND EXPANDED UPON IN
19:30:56  THE STAFF REPORT AND RECOMMENDS THAT THE PLANNING COMMISSION RECOMMEND
19:30:59  TO THE CITY COUNCIL ADOPT THE EIR ADDENDUM AND
19:31:03  ITS
MITIGATION MONITORING AND REPORTING PROGRAM, ADOPT
19:31:06  THE GENERAL PLAN AMENDMENT REDESIGNATING THE SITE
19:31:09  FROM REGIONAL COMMERCIAL TO TECH INDUSTRIAL, ADOPT
19:31:12  THE PRELIMINARY AND PRECISE ZONING
19:31:16 , IN THE
INDUSTRIAL GUIDELINES
19:31:20  AND VEST THE
19:31:25  TENTATIVE MAP.
JAICH
19:31:28  COMMERCIAL COFFIN DOUGH OWNERS ASSOCIATION WHICH REPRESENTS
19:31:32  A BUILT OUT PORTION OF THE GLOBE AND THE PROJECT APPLICANT.
THE
19:31:35  ISSUE WAS REGARDING  EASEMENTS FOR EXISTING PARKING
19:31:38  AREAS LOCATED BEHIND THE WESTERN MOST
19:31:41  COMMERCIAL BUILDING, BOAT PARTIES ARE
19:31:44  ON AGREEMENT ON THOSE PRIVATE TERMS.
19:31:47 
RECIPROCAL ACCESS WOULD BE IN PLACE AND EXISTING STALL QUANTITIES
19:31:50  AND ACCESS WOULD BE MAINTAINED THROUGH SITE DESIGN.
THE
19:31:54  CONDO OWNERS ASSOCIATION HAS SINCE WITHDRAWN THEIR OBJECTIONS
19:31:58  TO THE DEVELOPMENT.
THAT CONCLUDES STAFF'S PRESENTATION AND
19:32:01  I'M AVAILABLE FOR ANY QUESTIONS.
THANK YOU
19:32:04 .
>> Commissioner Daulton:   ALL RIGHT THANK YOU MARK
19:32:07 .
QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMUNICATIONS
19:32:15  COMMISSION?
ANYONE
19:32:20 ?
SORRY.

19:32:33 COMMISSIONER ZHANG.

19:32:37 >> Commissioner Zhang:   SO ONE OF THE CONCERNS FROM THE PUBLIC COMMENTS IS
19:32:40  THIS SITE MIGHT BE USED AS A LOCAL
19:32:43  DISTRIBUTION CENTER.
IF WE CHANGE
19:32:46  THE ZONE TO I.T. WOULD THAT KIND OF USE
19:32:49  USAGE BE ALLOWED?
19:32:53 
>> A DISTRIBUTION CENTER AND OTHER WAREHOUSE TYPE USES WOULD BE A 
19:32:56 PERMITTED USE IN THE I.T. ZONING DISTRICT WHICH IS WHAT THE PLANNED DISTRICT
19:33:00  IS BASED OFF.

19:33:06 >> Commissioner Zhang:   ALL RIGHT.
19:33:10 
>> Commissioner Daulton:   COMMISSIONER LIU.

19:33:14 >> Commissioner Liu:   SO WHEN THE SITE WAS USED FOR RETAIL
19:33:17 , I REASON WHEN HOME DEPOT WAS USING
19:33:20  ONE OF THE BUILDINGS AND THEN THERE WERE FURNITURE STORES
19:33:24 .
DO WE HAVE ANY
19:33:28  RETAIL SALES TAXES AND NUMBERS
19:33:31  THAT WE CAN COMPARE
19:33:34  TO WHAT POTENTIAL REVENUES THE CITY WILL BRING
19:33:38  IN AS A RESULT OF CONVERTING THE SITE
19:33:41  INTO LIGHT INDUSTRIAL AND
19:33:44  WHOLESALE DISTRIBUTION?
19:33:51 
>> THE STRATEGIC ECONOMICS ANALYSIS THAT WAS PREPARED DOES
19:33:54  INCLUDE REVENUE ANALYSIS RELATED TO THE PROPOSED INDUSTRIAL USE
19:33:57 .
BUT IT DOES NOT INCLUDE A REVENUE ANALYSIS
19:34:01  OF A THEORETICAL RETAIL USE.

19:34:05 >> Commissioner Liu:   DO WE HAVE ANY NUMBERS THAT WE
19:34:08  ACTUALLY COLLECTED WHEN RETAIL WAS GOING
19:34:11  ON IN
19:34:15  THIS -- IN THIS AREA?
THERE WERE FURNITURE
19:34:18  STORES, A NUMBER OF THEM,
19:34:21  IT SEEMS TO BE A GO-TO PLACE FOR A LOT OF THE PEOPLE WHO
19:34:25  NEEDED TO BUY FURNITURE.
DO WE HAVE
19:34:28  ANY NUMBERS FOR BEFORE?
>> NOT
19:34:30  AVAILABLE.
NO.
SORRY.

19:34:33 >> Planner Pullen:   NO, WE DON'T HAVE THOSE NUMBERS FROM THOSE -- IT WAS
19:34:37  QUITE SOME TIME AGO.
BUT I CAN KIND OF TALK
19:34:40  QUALITATIVELY WHERE WE ARE COMPARED TO WHERE WE USED TO BE
19:34:43 .
SO SINCE THE HOME DEPOT WENT AWAY, AND THAT WAS
19:34:46  QUITE SOME TIME AGO, I DON'T HAVE A PRECISE
19:34:49  YEAR, MARK OSH CLIFF MAY BUT IT
19:34:52  WAS AT LEAST SINCE THAT COSTCO THERE TURNED OVER
19:34:56  TO A WALMART ACROSS THE
STREET BEFORE THAT.
19:34:59 
AND AT THAT TIME WE HAD THE HOME DEPOT, THERE WAS BILLIARD
19:35:03  PLACE THERE WAS SOME FURNITURE PLACES AND OVER TIME SOME
19:35:06  SOME OF THOSE CHANGED HANDS.
BUT THE SITE WAS
19:35:09  PROPOSED FOR THIS COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT BACK IN
19:35:13  2006.
AS MARK MENTION
19:35:16 ED, THAT WAS ALWAYS INDUSTRIAL
19:35:19  LAND FROM THE TIME WHEN WE IDENTIFIED THE INDUSTRIAL AREAS
19:35:23  BACK IN THE
19:35:26   50s AND 60s FROM 2006 AND IT HAD
19:35:30  SORT OF AN OVERLAY THAT LOUD COMMERCIAL AS
19:35:33 
AN OPTION.
WHERE WE ARE NOW IS WE'VE GOT AN
19:35:36  INDUSTRIAL LAND PIECE THAT GOT REDESIGNATED
19:35:39  IN 2006 FOR COMMERCIAL, AND THEN
19:35:43  HAS LAIN VACANT
19:35:47 , EXCEPT FOR THOSE USES SLOWLY LEAVING BETWEEN THEN AND
19:35:50  NOW.
SO I THINK THE GENERAL PATTERN OR THE
19:35:54  GENERAL SORT OF COMMERCIAL
19:35:57  INCOME FROM THE AREA HAS BEEN A DOWNWARD
19:36:00  CURVE TO THE POINT OF REMOVAL OF THOSE BUILDINGS IN
19:36:04  PREPARATION FOR SOME OTHER USE.
19:36:15 
>> Commissioner Liu:   I HAVE A FOLLOW-UP QUESTION CHAIR.

19:36:18 SO HOW WAS THAT HALF A MILLION DOLLAR COMMUNITY
19:36:21  BENEFIT PLEDGE, AT THAT DOLLAR AMOUNT, ARRIVED
19:36:24  AT?
19:36:30 
>> Planner Pullen:   DURING THE PROJECT, WE MESSAGED TO THE
19:36:33  APPLICANT THAT THE GENERAL PLAN AMENDMENT IS A BIG STEP FOR A
19:36:36  CITY TO TAKE.
AND THAT
19:36:40  WHEN WE LOOK AT THE LAND AND WE LOOK
19:36:44  AT THE  PROPOSAL, THAT THEY
19:36:48  SHOULD IDENTIFY THE BENEFITS OF THE COMMUNITY
19:36:51 , CITY COUNCIL PLANNING COMMISSION.
THE APPLICANT
19:36:55  VOLUNTARILY OFFERED TO GIVE THOSE
19:36:58  FUNDS TO THE CITY TO DONATE THAT AMOUNT
19:37:01  AS PART OF A COMMUNITY BENEFIT TO
19:37:04  SORT OF TO SPEAK
19:37:07  TO THE BENEFIT TO THE CITY OF CHANGING THE LAND USE
19:37:11  FROM THAT
PERSPECTIVE.
THERE'S ALSO THE KIND OF
19:37:14  A CORE ANALYSIS THAT'S SEPARATE FROM THAT DOLLAR AMOUNT
19:37:17  THAT WOULD BE THE PART WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TONIGHT WITH THE ZONING AND
19:37:20  THE GENERAL PLAN AND THE CONSISTENCY WITH THE
SURROUND
19:37:24 ING, WHICH STANDS ON ITS OWN.
>> Commissioner Liu:   SO
19:37:27  IS THAT DOLLAR AMOUNT COMPARABLE TO OTHER
19:37:31  SIMILAR PROJECT THAT MAY HAVE BEEN
19:37:34  DEVELOPED AS A RESULT OF THE ZONING CHANGE IN THE PAST
19:37:39  PAST?
19:37:44 
>> Planner Pullen:   THERE IS REALLY NO PRECISE COMPARISON THAT WE COULD 
19:37:48 MAKE.
IN TERMS OF I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE WOULD COMPARE THAT DOLLAR
19:37:51  AMOUNT TO.
WITH RESPECT TO THE PROJECT, YOU
19:37:54  KNOW, SIZE OR THE
19:37:58  CONSIDERATIONS FOR CONVERTING OF THE LAND
19:38:01 , AND THE BENEFIT OFFERED.
IT'S REALLY NOT THAT
19:38:04  KIND OF A QUESTION.
IT'S MORE OF A -- OF
19:38:07  A VOLUNTARY OFFER
19:38:11  FROM THE DEVELOPER.
IF THAT MAKES SENSE.
WE DON'T HAVE
19:38:15  A CHEAT SHEET.
THERE'S NO NUMBER THAT'S
19:38:18  APPROPRIATE OR NOT APPROPRIATE.
IT'S JUST WHAT THEY'RE WILLING
19:38:22  WILLING -- WHAT THEY'VE BEEN OFFERED TO DONATE TO US
19:38:26 .
19:38:29 
>> Commissioner Liu:   SO IS IT CORRECT TO SAY THAT MOST OF THE MONEY 
19:38:32 WOULD BE USED TOWARDS AFFORDABLE HOUSING OR WHAT -- DO WE KNOW HOW
19:38:35  THE MONEY WILL BE USED?
19:38:42 
>> WE DON'T AND WE AWARDED THE CONDITION OF APPROVAL TO
19:38:45  ALLOW CITY COUNCIL ALLOCATION OF THE FUNDS AS THEY SEE FIT BASED
19:38:48  ON WHATEVER INITIATIVES OR POLICIES THEY WANT TO CONTRIBUTE
19:38:52  TOWARDS.
19:38:57 
>> Commissioner Liu:   THANK  YOU.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   ANY OTHER
19:39:00  QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMISSIONERS?

19:39:08 I GUESS I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS.
SO IN SPEAKING TO THE
19:39:12  APPLICANT, IT SEEMS LIKE THEY WERE  NONCOMMITTAL
19:39:15  AS TO EXACTLY WHAT KIND OF A CLIENT WAS
19:39:18  GOING TO BE IN THERE
19:39:21 , ALTHOUGH THERE HAS BEEN TALK IN SOME OF THE PEOPLE I SPOKE TO
THAT IT
19:39:25  WAS RUMORED THAT THIS WAS GOING TO BE AMAZON THAT WOS
19:39:28  WAS
19:39:31  PROJECTED TO TAKE UP THIS SPACE OR SOME OTHER LAST-
19:39:34  LAST-MILE CLIENT.
SO WE DON'T HAVE
19:39:38  ANYTHING FIRM ON THAT, MARK, IT'S JUST -- WE'RE
19:39:41  JUST REVIEWING THIS AS A RAW
19:39:44  SPACE, AND IS IT IN THAT
19:39:48  REGARD
19:39:52  NOT WITH REGARD TO SOME HADN'T
19:39:55  SOME HYPOTHETICAL
19:39:58  CLIENT BUT IN THAT REGARD?
19:40:01 
>> THAT'S CORRECT, CHAIR 
19:40:04  DAULTON.
SHELL BUILDINGS THAT WOULD BE FLEXIBLE ENOUGH TO ACCOMMODATE A
19:40:08  VARIETY OF USERS BASED ON INTEREST AND
19:40:11  DEMAND.
SO THE APPLICANT HAS NOT IDENTIFIED
19:40:14  ANY END USER FOR ANY OF THE BUILDINGS.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   BUT
19:40:17  CERTAINLY ONE OF THE USES WITH THE SHEER NUMBER OF TRUCK
19:40:20  BAYS WOULD SEEM TO BE A HIGH
19:40:24  VOLUME DELIVERY OF SOME SORT
19:40:27 .
DOES THAT MAKE SENSE?
19:40:30 
>> THE APPLICANT MIGHT BE ABLE TO SPEAK BETTER TOWARDS SORT OF THE
19:40:34  MARK DEMANDS FOR BUILDING DESIGN AND WHAT KIND
19:40:37  OF TENANTS THAT CERTAIN BUILDING TYPES WOULD ATTRACT.

19:40:42 BUT YES, THE PRESENCE OF TRUCK BAYS
19:40:46  WOULD SORT OF LEND A NOD TO A POTENTIAL
19:40:49  WAREHOUSE USER OR  E-COMMERCE USER
19:40:52 .
>> Commissioner Daulton:   OKAY.
CAN YOU JUST RUN OVER
19:40:56  THE SOLAR ON THIS BUILDING AND WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THAT?
I
19:40:59  NOTICE THERE'S SOME INDICATIONS OF SOLAR BUT THERE'S
19:41:03  NO ACTUAL COMMITMENT TO USE SOLAR IN THIS
19:41:06  PROJECT.
>> THE PROJECT HAS, THE
19:41:09  APPLICANT CAN EXPAND ON THIS BUT THE PROJECT HAS BEEN DESIGNED WITH
19:41:12  A SOLAR-READY ROOFTOP.
ALL THREE BUILDINGS
19:41:15  WOULD BE SORT OF PREPPED FOR SOLAR BUT PANELS
19:41:18  WOULD NOT BE PART OF THE INITIAL INSTALLATION OR INITIAL
19:41:21  CONSTRUCTION OF THE BUILDINGS.
>> Commissioner Daulton: 
19:41:25 OKAY.
SO COULD YOU TALK A
19:41:28  LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE CONFIGURATION OF THE SURROUNDING
19:41:31  ROADS?
I NOTICE IN SOME OF THE
19:41:34  LITERATURE YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT THE ROADS ARE GOING
19:41:39  TO BE FIXED UP, AT THE
19:41:42  APPLICANT'S EXPENSE.
CAN YOU -- ARE THERE GOING TO BE -- IS
19:41:45  THERE GOING TO BE FOUR LANES ON ALBRAE
19:41:48  OR WHAT'S GOING ON THERE?
I MEAN I'M TRYING TO
19:41:53  GET JUDGED AS TO HOW PREPARED THE CITY'S GOING TO BE FOR THE AMOUNT
19:41:57  OF TRUCK TRAFFIC THAT'S GOING TO BE IN THIS SITUATION.
19:41:59 
>> CERTAINLY.
AND WE HAVE THE SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS 
19:42:03 ON THE CITY SIDE.
OUR TRANSPORTATION DIVISION STAFF HERE TO PERHAPS
19:42:06  EXPAND ON MY ANSWER.
BUT
19:42:09  ON ALBRAE SPECIFICALLY AS YOU MENTIONED IT WOULD BE SIGNALIZE
19:42:13 ED, THAT PRIMARY DRIVEWAY THAT'S ALIGNED
19:42:16  WITH WALMART'S DRIVEWAY.
AND THERE WOULD BE
19:42:20  RE
19:42:25  RESTRIPING TO
19:42:28  CREATE LEFT TURN LANES.
THERE WOULD BE A RESTRIPING OF THE ROADWAY
19:42:31 .
>> Commissioner Daulton:   IS THAT STILL GOING TO BE ONE LANE EACH 
19:42:34 DIRECTION OR TWO LANES?
>> ONE LANE IN EACH DIRECTION
19:42:37 .
>> Commissioner Daulton:   OKAY
19:42:41 .
AND IT LOOKS AS
19:42:44  IF THE ELECTRIC
19:42:47  VEHICLE CHARGING THAT'S BEING PRIDED IN
19:42:51  PROVIDED IN THIS OPERATION
19:42:54  IS FAIRLY MINIMAL.
I
19:42:57  SEE THAT LIKE AMAZON AND SOME OF THESE
19:43:01  OTHER DELIVERY SERVICES ARE TENDING TO MOVE
19:43:04  TOWARDS OR LOOKING TOWARDS MOVING INTO ELECTRIC VEHICLES
19:43:08 .
DOES IT SEEM LIKE WE
19:43:11  HAVE ENOUGH OF THOSE CHARGING STATIONS OR THAT
19:43:15  FACILITY, WHAT DO YOU  THINK?
>> THE PROJECT HAS
19:43:18  BEEN  EVALUATED THROUGH A NUMBER OF ROUNDS OF REVIEW BY OUR BUILDING
19:43:21  STAFF.
AND THEY HAVE VERIFIED AND
19:43:24  CONFIRMED THAT THE PROJECT WOULD BE PROVIDING THE NECESSARY AMOUNT
19:43:28  OF EV CHARGING TO BE CODE AND THAT'S A 10
19:43:31 % QUANTITY OF I DON'T RECALL PARK
19:43:38  OVERRULE PARK
SPACES.
THOSE WOULD ACTUALLY
19:43:41  NOT JUST BE FLUMED BUT ACTUALLY HAVE 
19:43:48  PLUMBED BUT ACTUAL CHARGING UNITS
19:43:50 .
>> Commissioner Daulton:   AND ROUGHLY HOW MANY WOULD THAT BE?

19:43:53 >> I BELIEVE IT'S 71 OR 72.
>> Commissioner Daulton: 
19:43:57   AND THEN SO WITH REGARD TO THE
19:44:00  FUTURE OF THESE KIND OF LAST
19:44:04  MILE DELIVERY PROJECTS, WHICH APPEARS
19:44:07  TO BE POSSIBLY  DRIVERLESS VEHICLES,
19:44:10  IS THERE ANY KIND OF
CONSIDERATION OF THE POSSIBILITY
19:44:14  OF DRIVERLESS DELIVERY VEHICLES IN AND OUT OF THIS
19:44:17  THING AND POSSIBLY ROAD SENSORS OR
19:44:20  ANY KIND OF UPGRADES TO THE SURROUNDING STREETS IN
19:44:23  THAT REGARD?
HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT
19:44:26  THAT AT ALL?
>> THAT WAS NOT CONTEMPLATE
19:44:29 ED AS PART OF PLANNING'S EVALUATION OF THIS PROPOSAL
19:44:33 .
>> Commissioner Daulton:   OKAY.
>> Planner Pullen:   IF I CAN EXPAND
19:44:36 , CHAIR, ON A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT MARK SAID VERY
19:44:39  WELL, YES, THAT'S -- THAT WOULD BE
19:44:43  SPECULATIVE ABOUT WHETHER THOSE SERVICES COULD DO THAT
19:44:46 .
I'VE HEARD OF DRONES, TOO, YOU KNOW, DELIVERING PACKAGES AND THAT WAY
19:44:49 , I'M NOT SURE IF THAT'S IN THE CARDS
19:44:53  OR ANYWHERE IN THE BAY AREA OR FREMONT IN THE NEAR FUTURE.

19:44:56 BUT YOU ASKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT USES AND THERE WAS A DISCUSSION
19:44:59  SORT OF FORMING ABOUT SPECIFICALLY USER FOR
19:45:02  THIS BUILDING.
AND IT MAY WELL BE THAT A LAST
19:45:05  LAST-MIGHT DELIVERY IS ONE OF THE USES THAT COULD GO HERE.
BUT I
19:45:09  JUST WANT TO KIND OF PAINT THE PICTURE OF OUR INDUSTRIAL AREA
19:45:12  IS INTENDED TO, OVER TIME,
19:45:15  MORPH AND, AS THE ECONOMY CHANGES,
19:45:20  AS DEMISE SPACES,
19:45:23  AS DIFFERENT ENTITIES HAVE NEED FOR DIFFERENT SIZE
19:45:26 S
OF SPACES, IF YOU LOOK AT SOME OF OUR OTHER AREAS
19:45:29  THAT HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED IN FREMONT, WITH SIMILAR TYPES
19:45:33  OF BUILDINGS, YOU REALLY HAVE SEEN A
19:45:36  VARIETY FROM ECOSYSTEMS
19:45:39 , INDUSTRIAL ECOSYSTEMS, SUPPORT
19:45:43 
SUPPORTING TESLA AND OTHER LARGE COMPANIES IN TOWN
19:45:46 , MEDICAL YOU KNOW, RELATED
19:45:49  MANUFACTURING,  BIOTECH, YOU HAVE SEEN A
19:45:52  FAIR AMOUNT OF DELIVERY BECAUSE THAT'S SOMETHING THAT 
19:45:55 
INCREASINGLY WITH THE PANDEMIC IT WAS FRONT AND CENTER.

19:45:58 AND THAT'S A COMPONENT OF IT.
BUT EVEN OVER TIME
19:46:01 , SOME OF THESE SPACES HAVE
19:46:04  USE PERMITS FOR KIND OF ALLIED USES WITHIN THE INDUSTRIAL AREA THAT
19:46:07  MAY NOT BE
19:46:10  THE TOP TIER OR THE ONE WE'RE THINKING OF NOW.
SO
19:46:14  WE LOOK AT AN INDUSTRIAL AREA AS A LONG-
19:46:17 TERM FLEXIBLE USE
19:46:20  THAT WON'T BE THE SAME TEN YEARS FROM NOW AS IT IS TODAY.
AND
19:46:23  WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THOSE TRENDS WILL BE.
I DO WANT
19:46:26  TO GET TO THE CIRCULATION ITEM THAT MARK MENTIONED AND
19:46:29  YOU HAD TALKED ABOUT ALBRAE A LITTLE BIT AND ONE OF THE
19:46:33  LETTERS WE RECEIVED ALSO TALKED ABOUT ENCYCLOPEDIA
19:46:36  AND I KNOW IN HIS DISCLOSURES
19:46:40 
 THAT CHIEF STECKLER HAD TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE TRUCKS
19:46:43 .
AND DO I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THE NETWORK OF
19:46:46  THE ROADS FROM BOYCE,
19:46:50  TO 880,
19:46:54  BOTH STEVENSON AND AUTO MALL
19:46:57  ARE TRUCK ROUTES, BUILD TO HANDLE TRUCKED
19:47:00 .
ON ALBRAE THERE WAS CONCERN ABOUT THE EXTENT OF TRUCKS THAT
19:47:03  HAD COME THAT WAY
19:47:08  THAT WE DIDN'T DESIGN THE ROAD
19:47:11  IN THE CONTEXT OF THE
19:47:15  TRUCKS COMMENTING THAT WAY.
NOE
19:47:18  VELOSO CAN TALK A
19:47:22  BIT ABOUT THE IMPACT OF THE TRUCK TRAFFIC BUT THE
19:47:25  BIG PICTURE WITH THE DESIGN OF THE PROJECT IS
19:47:29  TO DIVIDE THE TRUCK TRAFFIC, DISTRIBUTORS
19:47:33  CAPITAL CATERING COMPANIES AND
19:47:36  THOSE
TYPES OF THINGS WHERE YOU'RE FEEDING INTO THAT TRUCK ROUTE
19:47:40  GOING DOWN STEVENSON BOULEVARD.
JUST A LITTLE MORE
19:47:43  TO ADD TO MARK'S BIT THERE.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   OKAY.
19:47:47 
SO THE GLOBE WAS ORIGINALLY GOING TO
19:47:50  BE PRETTY MUCH STRICTLY RETAIL, IT WAS ZONED
19:47:54  FOR RETAIL, IS THAT RIGHT?
THE ORIGINAL
19:47:57  GLOBE DEVELOPMENT.
>> YES, IT WAS
19:48:01  FOR GENERAL COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT BUT PREDOMINANTLY RETAIL
19:48:04  AND RESTAURANT.
THERE WAS A PERSONAL STORAGE FACILITY THAT WAS
19:48:07  APPROVED AS PART OF THAT PLANNED DISTRICT AS WELL THAT WAS
19:48:10  NEVER DEVELOPED.
BUT PREDOMINANTLY IT WAS RETAIL
19:48:13  COMMERCIAL IN NATURE.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   SO
19:48:17  WHAT THEN IS THE DIFFERENCE IN TERMS OF THE
19:48:20  CITY'S TAX INTAKE BETWEEN A RETAIL DEVELOPMENT OF THAT PROPERTY AND
19:48:23  A WOWS DEVELOPMENT OF THAT PROPERTY?
DO WE
19:48:26  GET ANY -- AND A
19:48:30  WAREHOUSE DEVELOPMENT OF THAT PROPERTY?
DO WE GET ANY KIND
19:48:33  OF ONGOING TAXES FOR A WAREHOUSE
19:48:37 ?
>> WHAT I CAN SAY, IT'S HARD TO RESPOND TO
19:48:40  CHAIR DAULTON'S QUESTIONS, IN THE STAFF REPORT
19:48:43  THERE WAS AN ANALYSIS COMPLETED BY
19:48:47  A ECONOMIST, STRATEGIC ECONOMICS AND IT CLEARLY
19:48:50  INDICATES HOW MUCH PROPERTY
TAX BUSINESS TAX
19:48:53  AS WELL AS RETAIL SALES TAX, THAT WOULD BE GENERATED
19:48:56 , IF THE -- THIS PROJECT IS ABLE
19:48:59  TO PROCEED FORWARD.
I'VE
19:49:02  HEARD FROM ALSO COMMISSIONER LIU, HOW DOES
19:49:06  THAT COMPARE TO IF THIS WERE TO REMAIN RETAIL
19:49:10 ?
CLEARLY IN THE STUDIES THAT WE'VE
19:49:13  PREPARED BY STRATEGIC ECONOMICS AS WELL AS ONE
19:49:17  OF THE CITY'S CONSULTANTS,
19:49:20  ALSO LOOKING INTO THE VIABILITY OF THIS SITE AS A
19:49:23  RETAIL, REMAINING AS RETAIL USE
19:49:27 , IT WAS
PRETTY MUCH ZERO.

19:49:30 AND IT'S BASED UPON AS STATED IN THE STAFF REPORT, THE LOCATION
19:49:33 .
IT'S NOT A GREAT LOCATION.
IT'S OFF YOU
19:49:37  KNOW STEVENSON WHICH IS WHERE YOU HAVE THE VISIBILITY
19:49:40  AND CLEARLY IT WASN'T FROM THE HOME
19:49:43  DEPOT, HOME DEPOT LEFT AND
19:49:46  MOVED TO AUTO MALL
19:49:50 , REI AS WELL, AND FURNITURE USES ALSO
19:49:53  HAVE FAILED.
WE WANTED TO TALK ABOUT RETAIL
19:49:56  SALES TAX, WE WERE GENERATING VERY LITTLE
19:49:59 .
AND ALSO, BECAUSE OF THE PROXIMITY OF THIS CENTER
19:50:03  TO PACIFIC COMMONS WHICH WAS SHORTLY THEREAFTER BUILT,
19:50:06  PRETTY MUCH THAT WAS -- THAT IS OUR
19:50:09  MAJOR RETAIL DISTRICT FOR THE CITY OF FREMONT.
AND
19:50:13  ONCE PACIFIC COMMONS OPENED UP,
19:50:16  THIS CENTER PRETTY MUCH  DIED.
AND SO IT'S CLEAR IN THAT
19:50:19  AT LEAST THE ANALYSIS THAT I'VE SEEN AND
19:50:22  THE RECOMMENDATIONS MADE BY THE CONSULTANT HERE, THAT
19:50:27  THESE PROFESSIONALS WHO ARE LOCAL LEADING ECONOMISTS, THAT THIS
19:50:31  SITE PRETTY
MUCH WILL JUST SIT THE WAY IT IS WITH A
19:50:35  RETAIL DESIGNATION.
BECAUSE IT'S NOT GOING TO PEN SILT.

19:50:38   PENCIL.

19:50:41 >> Commissioner Daulton:   OKAY.
SO THEN WITH REGARD
19:50:44  TO THE CONTENTION OF THE SIERRA CLUB REGARDING
19:50:48  THE MITIGATED
19:50:52  NEG DEC, LOOKING OVER THE ADDENDUM
19:50:55  TO THE EIR PAGE 26, WHEN
19:50:58  WE TALK ABOUT THE
19:51:04  VMT IN PARTICULAR AND REDUCE
19:51:07  REDUCED
VEHICLE TRIPS,
19:51:10  I START TO, WHEN I LOOK AT THIS, I SEE
19:51:13  THAT THE REDUC
19:51:16 ED VEHICLE TRIPS WAS IDENTIFIED TO REDUCE  EMISSIONS
19:51:19 , BUT THE REDUCTION WOULD NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO
19:51:22  REDUCE EMISSIONS BELOW
19:51:26 
SIGNIFICANT THRESHOLDS AND THEREFORE THE IMPACT
19:51:29  WAS DETERMINED TO BE SIGNIFICANT AND UNAVOIDABLE.
AND FOLLOWING
19:51:32  THAT THERE'S A SERIES OF MITIGATIONS FOR THAT
19:51:36 , THOSE VEHICLE TRIPS.
THOSE MITIGATIONS,
19:51:39  THOUGH, THEY DON'T SEEM TO
19:51:42  TAKE INTO ACCOUNT ANY KIND
19:51:45  OF MASSIVE TRUCKING OPERATION
19:51:49 .
THEY'RE MORE LIKE
19:51:53  TRANSIT FACILITIES, BICYCLE LANES,
19:51:56  SIDEWALKS,
19:52:00  CONVENIENTLY LOCATED BICYCLE STORAGE.

19:52:03 I DON'T SEE HOW THAT'S GOING TO TAKE CARE OF SOME KIND
19:52:06  OF LARGE UPTICK IN TRUCK
19:52:09  TRAFFIC IN THIS AREA
19:52:13  REGARDING VMT.
CAN YOU EXPLAIN THAT TO
19:52:16  ME?
HOW IS
19:52:20  A BICYCLE STORAGE  CONTAINER MITIGATE
19:52:23  VMT WITH REGARDS TO A DELIVERY SERVICE
19:52:27 ?
>> Planner Pullen:   THAT
19:52:30  QUESTION IS PROBABLY BEST  ANSWERED THROUGH A
19:52:33  COMBINATION OF OUR TRAFFIC FOLKS
19:52:36 , NOE  VELOSO, AND ALSO
19:52:40  OUR CONSULTANT FOR CEQA, REBECCA
19:52:43  AULD WHO WROTE THE ADDENDUM
IN LARGE PART
19:52:47  THAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO.
BIG PICTURE, I JUST WANT TO
19:52:51  KIND OF SETTLE THE STAGE BEFORE WE GET INTO THAT.
WHAT THE
19:52:54  CITY'S ENVIRONMENTAL DOCUMENT SAYS OR THE TYPE OF ENVIRONMENTAL
19:52:58  DOCUMENT WE USED
19:53:01  BECAUSE
19:53:04  ADDENDUMS
19:53:09  ARE DIFFERENT, EXEMPT, YOU CAN SEE THOSE
19:53:12  WHERE IT'S IN USE AN EXISTING
BUILDING, A PROJECT
19:53:16  CAN REQUIRE WHAT'S CALLED A NEK
19:53:19  NEG DEC, BELOW THE LEVEL
19:53:22  OF SIGNIFICANCE THAT WOULD REQUIRE TO YOU PREPARE AN EIR
19:53:26 .
THEY'RE NOT SIGNIFICANT WITH OUR MITIGATIONS.
19:53:29 
OR MITIGATED NEG DEC
19:53:32  IN THAT CASE.
IF YOU CAN'T MITIGATE
19:53:35  THAT -- YOU SHOULD DO AN EIR.
WE DID AN
19:53:38  EIR FOR THIS PROJECT IN 2006 WHEN IT WAS THE
19:53:42  GLOBE.
AND THEN WHEN ANOTHER PROJECT COMES ALONG IN A
19:53:45  SITE WHERE YOU'VE DONE AN EIR IF THERE ARE
19:53:48  CERTAIN TESTS MET, LEGAL TESTS
19:53:51  MET YOU MAY BE REQUIRED TO DO A NEW EIR BUT IF YOU
19:53:54  DON'T MEET THOSE TESTS AND
YOU CAN SHOW THE PROJECT IS
19:53:59  IN SUMMARY, LESS
19:54:02  INTENSE THAN THE PREVIOUSLY APPROVED
19:54:05  PROJECT THEN YOU DO AN ADDENDUM AND THE
19:54:09  ADDENDUM EXPLAINS HOW THIS COMPARES TO THE PREVIOUS PROJECT.
JUST WITH
19:54:13  THAT SETUP I WANT TO DEFER TO OUR
19:54:16  CONSULTANTS ON
19:54:20  THE PROJECT.
>> THIS IS REBECCA AUL
19:54:23 ULD, THE CEQA CONSULTANT.
19:54:27 
THOSE REFERENCES, THOSE ARE MEASURES YOU WOULD
19:54:30  SEE TODAY IN A TDM POLICEMAN, A TRANSPORTATION
19:54:34  DEMAND MANAGEMENT PLAN WHICH IS FOCUSED
19:54:37  ON THE EMPLOYEES AND THEIR TRIPS TO AND FROM WORK.
SO
19:54:40  THAT'S WHAT THOSE MEASURES WERE AND ARE INTENDED TO
19:54:44  ADDRESS MORE THAN THE TRUCK TRIPS FOR DELIVERIES THEMSELVES
19:54:47 .
THE WAY THAT THE VMT MEASURE,
19:54:50  THE THRESHOLDS ARE SET UP IS ACTUALLY BASED ON
19:54:53  THAT HOME TO WORK TRIP OF EMPLOYEES IN THE AREA.
THAT'S
19:54:57  AS RECOMMENDED BY THE STATE AND ADOPTED BY CITY OF FREMONT.

19:55:00 SO WHEN WE REVIEW VMT
19:55:03  FOR PROJECTS, WE ARE IN FACT LOOKING AT
19:55:06  THOSE EMPLOYEE-HOME-TO
19:55:09 -WORK TRIPS EXCLUSIVELY AND NOT
19:55:12  THE DELIVERY TRIP.
SO THAT BEING SAID, THAT IS THE MEASURE THAT
19:55:15  WOULD AFFECT THOSE THINGS, WOULD AFFECT VMT AS
19:55:19  THE ONES TARGETED AT THE EMPLOYEES.
WHEN
19:55:22  IT COMES TO THE TRUCK TRIPS THERE ARE MEASURES THAT
19:55:25  ARE IN PLACE NOW ABOVE AND BEYOND THOSE AT THE TIME
19:55:28  AND IT HAS TO DO WITH REGULATIONS THAT WERE  ADOPTED BY CITY OF FREMONT
19:55:31  AND EVENLY THE
STATE SINCE THE PRIOR EIR HAVING TO DO
19:55:36  WITH EMISSIONS CONTROLS ON TRUCKS
19:55:41  AS WELL AS ENERGY EFFICIENCY, WATER EFFICIENCY,
19:55:44  OF BUILDINGS, MEASURES SUCH AS
19:55:48  THAT, THAT NOW WOULD BE NEEDED TO BE
INCORPORATED INTO THE
19:55:51  PROJECT AS STANDARDS.
>> Commissioner Daulton: 
19:55:54   SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT BECAUSE THE
19:55:58  TRUCKS GET BETTER MILEAGE THAN THEY DID IN 2006
19:56:01 , THEY'RE PROBABLY SIGNIFICANTLY MITIGATED
19:56:05  BETWEEN WHAT WE WOULD HAVE SEEN THEN, AND WHAT
WE WOULD HAVE SEEN
19:56:08  NOW?
YOU SEE WHERE I'M GOING WITH THIS?
WE DON'T HAVE ANY
19:56:12  IDEA HOW MANY TRUCKS ARE GOING TO BE GOING
19:56:15  IN AND OUT OF THERE.
YES, I UNDERSTAND THE VMT IS THE EMPLOYEE
19:56:18  ISSUE.
BUT
19:56:21  WE DON'T REALLY KNOW HOW MUCH TRAFFIC IS GOING
19:56:24  TO BE IN AND OUT OF THERE, WE'RE LOOKING AT
19:56:28  A SITUATION WHERE THERE COULD BE, YOU KNOW --
19:56:31  50, 60, TRIPS AN HOUR IN AND OUT EVER
19:56:34  THERE BY TRUCKS
GOING WITHIN A 15
19:56:37 -MILE RANGE OF THE -- 20 MILE RANGE OF THAT
19:56:40  SITE.
SO I WANT
19:56:44  TO BE SURE THAT WE'RE DOING DUE DILIGENCE TO
19:56:47  SEE THAT THAT IS
19:56:50  MITIGATED SOMEHOW.
AND I JUST KNOW THAT A
19:56:53  BIKE LANE IS NOT GOING TO DO THAT
19:56:56 .
>> SO I CAN ONLY RESPOND FROM A CEQA PERSPECTIVE AND
19:57:00  WE ARE SOMEWHAT CONSTRAINED WHEN IT COMES TO
19:57:03  TRANSPORTATION AND WHAT WE'RE ALLOWED TO CONSIDER AS AN IMPACT ON THE
19:57:06  ENVIRONMENT UNDER CEQA.
THAT BEING SAID, ONE OF THE
19:57:11  ATTACHMENTS TO THE DOCUMENT, ATTACHMENT D IS THE TRANSPORTATION
19:57:14  IMPACT ANALYSIS THAT WAS PREPARED FOR THIS PROJECT.
IT DID ASSESS THE TRIPS
19:57:17  OF THE PROJECT.
AND YES, THE LAND USE THAT IT LOOKED
19:57:20  AT, IT CONSIDERED ALL OF THE POSSIBLE USES
19:57:23  THAT COULD GO INTO THERE AND IT PICKED THE ONE THAT
19:57:26  WOULD HAVE THE HIGHEST TRIPS, HIGHEST TRUCK
19:57:30  TRIPS WHICH WOULD
INCORPORATE THIS LAST-MILE USE
19:57:33  THAT FOLKS HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT AS A POTENTIAL.
THAT IS IN
19:57:36  FACT WHAT WE ANALYZED WHEN IT COMES TO THE TRIPS AND THE
19:57:40  TRANSPORTATION ANALYSIS.
AND THEN PULLED INTO THE  EMISSIONS
19:57:43  ANALYSIS.
SO THERE WAS THAT ASSESSMENT
19:57:46  DONE.
IT IS INCLUDED IN THE  ATTACHMENT.
BUT WE
19:57:50  CAN'T LEGALLY PULL THAT INTO THE CEQA CONSIDERATION
19:57:55 .
THE LOCAL TRANSPORTATION  IMPACTS.
19:57:58 
BUT IT IS INCLUDED IN THE RECORD THERE
19:58:02 .
IS.
>> SO CHAIR DAULTON, LET
19:58:05  ME JUST ADD, WHAT'S BEFORE THE PLANNING COMMISSION IS A
19:58:08  RECOMMENDATION THAT INCLUDES A NUMBER OF ENTITLEMENTS,
19:58:12  INCLUDES A GENERAL PLAN AMENDMENT, REZONING AND OVEST
19:58:16 ING
TENTATIVE MAP AND IT'S TO FACILITATE AND ALLOW THE DEVELOPMENT
19:58:19  OF THESE THREE INDUSTRIAL BUILDINGS.
THE INTEND
19:58:22 ED USE, WELL, WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE INTENDED USE IS AT A
19:58:29  TODAY.
HOWEVER, THE ANALYSIS TAKES INTO ACCOUNT
19:58:32  THE MOST INTENSIFIED USE WITHIN THAT LAND
19:58:35  USE CATEGORY.
IN ADDITION TO THAT THERE WAS A TRAFFIC STUDY AS REBECCA
19:58:39  MENTIONED THAT WAS PERFORMED RECENTLY AND IT IS
19:58:42  A LOCAL TRANSPORTATION ANALYSIS.
WE DO HAVE AND I'D LIKE TO
19:58:46  INTRODUCE OUR ASSISTANT CITY ENGINEER, NO
19:58:49 E VELOSO WHO WOULD BE ABLE TO ANSWER
19:58:52  YOUR  QUESTIONS.
YOU WANT TO GET AN IDEA WHAT THE TRUCK
19:58:55  TRIPS LOOK LIKE, AND SO  NOE
19:58:58  IF YOU CAN ADD TO THAT CONVERSATION THAT WOULD BE GREAT
19:59:01  GREAT.
>> YES, GOOD EVENING, PLANNING COMMISSION
19:59:05 , NOE VELOSO
19:59:08  ASSISTANT ENGINEER WITH THE PUBLIC WORKS DEPARTMENT.
WITH
19:59:11  ME ALSO IS MY COLLEAGUE WHO WAS
19:59:14  THE ENGINEER FOR PROJECT.
BUT TO TRY TO
19:59:19  ANSWER CHAIR DAULTON'S QUESTION I COMPLETELY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT
19:59:22  THERE ARE CERTAIN ASPECTS OF THE --
19:59:26  OF THE PROPOSED PROJECT THAT WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO
19:59:29  MITIGATE BUT SOME OF THE MEASURES
THAT WERE IDENTIFIED, WE CAN'T
19:59:32  TRULY MITIGATE
19:59:35  TRUCK TRIPS AND THEN ALSO SINGLE USE TRUCKS
19:59:38  FROM THEIR DELIVERY OPERATIONS.
THE
19:59:41  MEASURES IDENTIFIED ARE REALLY TO TARGET OTHER TRIPS
19:59:45  THAT MAY BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROJECT SITE.
SO
19:59:50  IF SOMEONE WERE TO RUN
19:59:53  AN ERRAND, IF SOMEONE WERE TO GO TO LUNCH FROM THE SITE AND THEY WERE WORKING
19:59:56  AT THE SITE, NOT NECESSARILY MAKING DELIVERIES ASSOCIATED
20:00:00  OR RUNNING BETWEEN DISTRIBUTION
CENTERS,
20:00:03  WE ARE LOOKING AT OTHER TRIPS THAT WE COULD POTENTIAL
20:00:06 LY ELIMINATE BY PROVIDING OTHER OPTIONS
20:00:10  THAT EMPLOYEES CAN TAKE.
THAT'S THE REASON WE'VE IDENTIFIED THESE
20:00:13  MEASURES THAT MAY NOT REALLY CORRELATE WITH THE OPERATION
20:00:18 S IDENTIFIED FOR THE PROJECT.
BUT MOSTLY TO TRY TO
20:00:21  ELIMINATE TRIPS THAT ARE ON THE FRINGES,
20:00:24  THAT CAN BE TAKEN WITH THE SHORT DISTANCE
20:00:27 S WITH THE MEASURES WE PROVIDED
20:00:30 .
>> Commissioner Daulton:   AND NOE WHILE I HAVE
20:00:33  YOU HERE, CAN YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE NUMBER
20:00:37  OF LANES ON ALBRAE
20:00:40  AND I ASSUME THAT YOU FEEL THAT A TWO LANE ROAD
20:00:44  THERE IS GOING TO BE SUFFICIENT
TO HANDLE THE KIND OF TRAFFIC THAT WE'RE
20:00:47  TALKING  ABOUT, IS THAT RIGHT?
>> YES, SO CURRENTLY
20:00:51 , ALBRAE IS 44 FEET WIDE IN WIDTH
20:00:54  FROM CURB TO CURB.
IT'S
20:00:57  CURRENTLY STRIPED AS A TWO LANE ROADWAY WITH A TWO
20:01:02 -WAY LEFT TURN CENTER LANE.
20:01:05 
THERE REALLY ISN'T AN OPPORTUNITY TO WIDEN IT TO CARRY FOUR LANES.

20:01:08 CURRENTLY, THE ADT OR AVERAGE DAILY TRAFFIC
20:01:11  ON ALBRAE IS CLOSE TO 10,000 VEHICLES.
WE
20:01:15  DON'T EXPECT THAT TO GROW TOO MUCH OVER THE NEXT YOU KNOW
20:01:18  20, 30 YEARS BASED ON OUR GENERAL PLAN PROJECTIONS AND
20:01:22  FORECAST.
THE REASON WE -- AND WE
20:01:25  THINK THE EXISTING CONFIGURATION CAN
20:01:28  DEFINITELY HANDLE ALL OF THE EXPECTED TRAFFIC FROM THE
20:01:32  SITE.
FOR US IT WAS JUST A MATTER OF OVERALL
20:01:36  SAFETY.
WE FEEL AS THOUGH TRUCK TRAFFIC IS BETTER SUIT
20:01:39 ED TO COME OFF OF STEVENSON
20:01:42  AND ENCYCLOPEDIA AS OPPOSED TO MIXING IN WITH
20:01:46  HIGHER SPEED HIGHER VOLUME PASSENGER VEHICLES
20:01:49  ALONG ALBRAE.
YOU KNOW ENCYCLOPEDIA AS
20:01:52  JOEL KIND OF MENTIONED EARLIER IT IS ALREADY
20:01:55  UTILIZED AS AN INDUSTRIAL SITE WITH HEAVY TRUCK TRAFFIC.
THERE'S
20:01:58  ALREADY A HOME DEPOT DISTRIBUTION CENTER WITHIN
20:02:01  THAT AREA.
THERE IS ALREADY THAT EXISTING USE.
20:02:04 
SO WE FELT THAT THERE'S
20:02:07  A CONSISTENCY THERE, IT'S BETTER SUITED FOR
20:02:10  ENCYCLOPEDIA AND THERE'S JUST A LOT MORE CONFLICT THAT WE WOULDN'T WANT
20:02:14  WITH TRUCK TRAFFIC ON ALBRAE.
AND SO
20:02:17  IN TERMS OF THE DESIGN, WE FEEL AS THOUGH
20:02:20  THERE'S IMPROVEMENTS WE CAN MAKE, IN TERMS OF ACCESS FOR THE PROJECT
20:02:23  SITE ON ALBRAE.
BUT ULTIMATELY THE DESIGN
20:02:26  WILL REMAIN AS A TWO LANE ROADWAY WITH A
20:02:30  CENTER LANE TURNING LANE
20:02:33 .
>> Commissioner Daulton:   OKAY.
20:02:39 
I GUESS THAT'S -- OH WAIT.

20:02:42 SO THEN, IS ANY OTHER COMMISSIONER
20:02:45  HAVE A QUESTION FOR NOE?
IF NOT I'M
20:02:48  GOING TO GO BACK TO MARK.
MARK, CAN
20:02:51  WE -- I DO WANT TO DISCUSS A LITTLE
20:02:55  FURTHER THE BENEFITS PLEDGE
20:02:58 .
BECAUSE
20:03:01  MY EXPERIENCE WITH THE ONLY OTHER
20:03:04  BENEFITS PLEDGE I WAS INVOLVED WITH, WHICH WAS THE
20:03:07  NILES GATEWAY PLEDGE OF  $300,000, IS
20:03:12  THAT THAT MONEY SEEMED TO SIMPLY HAVE GONE INTO
20:03:15  A SLUSH FUND,
AS FAR AS CAN I TELL
20:03:19 .
THAT IT WAS SORT OF PITCHED TO US
20:03:23  AS
20:03:27  SAFE PARKING MONEY AND IT WAS PITCHED TO THE PUBLIC AT SAFE PARKING
20:03:31  MONEY BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT HAPPENED TO IT.
THAT MONEY
20:03:34  WAS DIFFUSED INTO CITY OPERATIONS AND THERE'S
20:03:38  NEVER BEEN TO MY KNOWLEDGE A SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING OF HOW MUCH OF
20:03:41  THAT MONEY WENT INTO SAFE PARKING.
SO WHEN
20:03:44  THE APPLICANT TELLS ME THAT AN AMOUNT OF
20:03:47  MONEY IS GOING TO BE EARMARKED FOR A CERTAIN
20:03:51 , YOU KNOW, PROBLEM, WHICH IN THIS
20:03:54  CASE SEEMS TO BE HOMELESSNESS
20:03:59 ,
20:04:03  I CAN ONLY UNDERSTAND
20:04:06  WHY THAT CAN LATCH
ONTO AN ISSUE THAT EVERYBODY WANTS
20:04:10  TO SOLVE, RIGHT BUT I DON'T
20:04:13  SEE ANY SAFEGUARD THAT THAT MONEY IS
20:04:17  GOING TO BE USED IN THAT
20:04:20  FASHION.
MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IT MAY NOT BE.
20:04:23 
THERE'S NOT A QUESTION MARK ON THE END OF THAT COMMENT BUT
20:04:26  LET'S PRETEND THAT THERE WAS.
DO YOU HAVE
20:04:29  ANY COMMENTS ON  THAT?
>> LET ME TRY TO RESPOND TO
20:04:33  CHAIR DAULTON'S QUESTION THERE.
WE HAVE NOT AS MARK HAS
20:04:36   MENTIONED AND E-MAIL RESPONSE TO THE PLANNING COMMISSION HAVE RECEIVED THAT
20:04:39  300,000 FROM THAT UNRELATED NILES
20:04:42  GATEWAY PROJECT.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   YOU HAVE NOT?
20:04:45 
>> TO BE CLEAR WE HAVE NOT.
20:04:48 
BUT IT APPLIED TO THE FINAL MAP AND THE INTENTION IS
20:04:52  TO USE IT ON THE PROGRAMS SUCH AS THE
20:04:55  NAVIGATION CENTER, THE HOUSING NAVIGATION CENTER OR TO HOUSE
20:04:58  THE HOMELESS.
BUT THAT IS TO BE DETERMINED.

20:05:01 BUT DO I WANT TO CLARIFY THAT, THE CITY HAS
20:05:08  I DO WANT TO CLARIFY THAT, THE CITY HAS NOT RECEIVED
20:05:11  THOSE FUNDS.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   I DO UNDERSTAND THAT, YOU UNDERSTAND
20:05:14  MY TREPIDATION TAKEN ON FACE
20:05:17  VALUE, TOWARDS THE PROBLEM THAT
20:05:21  THE CITY HAS PERCEIVED TO BE A POPULAR HOT BUTTON
20:05:24  ISSUE BY THE PUBLIC THAT
WOULD ACTUALLY BRING
20:05:27  PUBLIC SUPPORT, PERHAPS FOR THE PROJECT,
20:05:30  AND THEN WHO KNOWS?
AFTER
20:05:33  THAT IT'S ALL JUST WHATEVER
20:05:37 .
YOU KNOW, I GOT TO SAY I'M NOT PLEASED
20:05:40  WITH WHAT HAPPENED THERE AND I DON'T WANT TO SEE THAT HAPPEN HERE
20:05:42 .
>> Planner Pullen:   CHAIR, I DO WANT TO BE CLEAR.

20:05:46 SO THIS PROJECT, SUBJECT TO YOUR RECOMMENDATION AND
20:05:49  THEN CITY COUNCIL'S THE FINAL  DECISION-MAKING BODY
20:05:52 , CITY COUNCIL DOES RETAIN THE PURVIEW
20:05:55  OF ALLOCATING FUNDS.
AND SO
20:05:58  IF THE CITY COUNCIL CHOSE
20:06:02  TO APPROVE THE PROJECT AND ACCEPT A
20:06:05  MONETARY COMMUNITY BENEFIT, THEY
20:06:08  WOULD HAVE THAT PURVIEW,
20:06:11  TO DECIDE WHAT TO DO WITH IT.
I UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE A --
20:06:14  SOUNDS LIKE YOU HAVE A CONCERN WITH POTENTIAL USE
20:06:18  OF THE MONEY WE HAVEN'T RECEIVED YET
20:06:20 .
BUT --
>> Commissioner Daulton:   MY CONCERN 
20:06:23 IS MORE WITH HOW IT'S BEING SOLD TO US, AS THIS IS
20:06:27  GOING TO BE EARMARKED FOR THE HOMELESS.
AND I WANT
20:06:30 , IN THE PUBLIC MEETING I WANT EVERYONE TO BE
20:06:33  CLEAR THAT THAT MIGHT NOT BE THE CASE
20:06:38 .
THAT'S ALL
20:06:41 .
>> THE
20:06:44  APPLICANT HAS SUGGESTED IN THEIR LITERATURE THAT IT
20:06:48  BE USED FOR POTENTIAL HOMELESS SERVICES.
HOWEVER
20:06:51  THE CONDITION OF APPROVAL HAS BEEN WORDED THAT IT
20:06:54  WOULD BE SUBJECT TO THE DISCRETION OF THE CITY COUNCIL FOR WHATEVER CAUSE THEY WANT TO EARMARK
20:06:57  IT FOR.
SO WE HAVE NOT IDENTIFIED A SPECIFIC CAUSE
20:07:01  THAT THAT MONEY WOULD GO TOWARDS.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   OKAY, THANK
20:07:04  YOU.
COMMISSIONERS ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FOR STAFF
20:07:08 ?
20:07:13 
ALL RIGHT.
IN THAT CASE I BELIEVE WE HAVE
20:07:16  OUR APPLICANTS PRESENT AND THEY HAVE TEN MINUTES TO GIVER A PRESENTATION.

20:07:20 >> HELLO, CAN YOU GUYS HEAR ME?
20:07:23 
THIS IS MAC CARLSEN
20:07:26  FROM STAFF.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   I CAN HEAR YOU.

20:07:29 >> THANKS EVERYONE.
I HAVE A PRESENTATION.
SOME OF
20:07:33  IT IS SIMILAR TO WHAT MARK'S RUN THROUGH
20:07:36  IN HIS PRESENTATION.
SO I'LL TRY TO MAKE IT
20:07:39  QUICK HERE FOR YOU GUYS.
I APPRECIATE STAFF,
20:07:42  I APPRECIATE THE COMMISSION BEING HERE TONIGHT AND THE PUBLIC AS WELL
20:07:46 .
I'M MAC CARLSEN LIKE I
20:07:49  SAID, SCANNE
20:07:52 LL PROPERTIES.
I'VE BEEN WORKING ON
20:07:56  IT ABOUT TWO YEARS NOW, REALLY EXCITED
20:07:59  TO BE WHERE WE ARE AT NOW AND APPRECIATIVE
20:08:02  OF STAFF AND ALL THE HARD WORK THEY'VE PUT IN
20:08:06  AS WELL.

20:08:17 ALL RIGHT YES AS YOU MENTIONED  MA
20:08:21 C CARLSON, TODD BEY
20:08:25  BERRYHIL
20:08:28 L, OUR OFFICE IS IN
20:08:32  THE EAST BAY.
SO JUST WANT TO QUICKLY
20:08:35  TALK ABOUT SCANNELL
20:08:38 , OUR FIRST PROJECT IN FREMONT FIRST OF
20:08:41  HOPEFULLY MANY.
WE ARE REALLY BULLISH ON THE AREA AND ALL
20:08:44  THE STATISTICS AND LIKE I SAID THE STAFF HAS BEEN EXTREMELY PROFESSIONAL
20:08:48  TO WORK WITH.
SCAN
20:08:51 NELL IS ABOUT A 30 YEAR COMPANY.
WE
20:08:54  HAVE OFFICES IN U.S. AND EUROPE
20:08:57 , REGIONALLY.
ALL ASSET
20:09:00  CLASSES AS HAS BEEN MENTIONED
20:09:04  MANY MANUFACTURING WAREHOUSE, COLD STORAGE,
20:09:07  THE GAMBIT OF INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT
20:09:11  DEVELOPMENT.
QUICK LIST OF OUR CLIENTS.
ONE OF
20:09:14  THE THINGS THAT IS IN SCANNELL'S D
20:09:17 NA IS BUILD TO SUIT MENTALITY AND REPEAT
20:09:21  BUSINESS WITH CLIENTS.
WE LIKE TO BE
20:09:24  ABLE TO GO WITH OUR CLIENTS TO DIFFERENT MARKETS AND SERVICE THEIR NEEDS.
20:09:27 
QUICKLY WANT TO TALK ABOUT  SCANNELL
20:09:30  IN THE COMMUNITY.
WE OPERATE A
20:09:34  PHILANTHROPY ARM, ROBERT J. SCAN
20:09:38 NELL IS THE FOUNDER AND PRESIDENT
20:09:41 , MUCH OF THE CHARITABLE WORK FOCUSES ON ISSUES
20:09:44  OF FOOD INSECURITY, TRADITIONAL HOUSING
20:09:49  TRANSITIONAL
20:09:52  HOUSING, WOMEN'S
SECURITY
20:09:55 , CONTRA COSTA FOOD BANK IS ONE OF THE PARTNERS
20:09:59  WE WORK WITH AND MORE LOCALLY IN FREMONT WE'VE BASED
20:10:02  ON FEEDBACK FROM COUNCIL WE WILL BE
20:10:05  SUPPORTING TRICITIES FOOD BANK
20:10:08  ALONG WITH SAVE.

20:10:12 I WANT TO QUICKLY GO THROUGH A
20:10:15  CASE STUDY IN ALAMEDA COUNTY IN LIVERMORE.
WE'VE HAD A
20:10:18  VERY SUCCESSFUL  ONGOING RELATIONSHIP WITH THE CITY OF
20:10:22  LIVERMORE.
THERE'S THREE PROJECTS WE'VE DONE IN THE LAST COUPLE
20:10:25  OF  YEARS.
ALL OF VERY SIMILAR SIZE AND
20:10:28   USES.
OF WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING HERE IN FREMONT
20:10:31 .
YOU CAN SEE GOOD HIGH DESIGN
20:10:35  FINISHES, PUBLIC AREAS
20:10:38 , PUBLIC ART, THINGS LIKE THAT, THAT MAKE THESE MORE THAN
20:10:41  JUST KIND OF BOXES OUT THERE
20:10:45 .
THESE ARE SOME INFORMATION ON EACH OF THOSE
20:10:48  THREE PROJECTS IN LIVERMORE.
ONE WAS WITH F
20:10:51 M INDUSTRIES, THAT WAS A BUILD TO SUIT WE DID
20:10:55  IN LIVERMORE.
THAT IS AN INDUSTRY THAT'S
20:10:59  FAMILIAR TO FREMONT, ANOTHER WAS WITH
20:11:02  SANDHU NUTRITION, A LOCAL
20:11:06  NUTRITION MANUFACTURER, NEEDED SPACE IN LIVERMORE WE WERE ABLE
20:11:09  TO FIND THEM DEVELOP THEM A LONG TERM HOME.

20:11:12 FINAL ONE HAS NOT BEEN SPOKEN FOR YET BUT IT WAS THE
20:11:15  MIDDLE PROJECT ON THE LAST ONE AND THAT COULD BE
20:11:18  EITHER A MANUFACTURING OR DISTRIBUTION TENANT.
NOW TO GET
20:11:21  INTO OUR PROJECT, STAFF
20:11:24  HAS SHOWED THE SITE PLAN SO I DON'T NEED TO GO TOO
20:11:28  MUCH ON TO THIS.
I WILL SAY WE WORKED SUPER
20:11:31  SUPERCOLLABORATIVELY WITH THEM.
I THINK WE HAD EIGHT PLANNING
20:11:34  SUBMITTALS WITH ALL TAKING INTO ACCOUNT ALL THE STAFF
20:11:37 'S RECOMMENDATIONS, REMOVE DRIVEWAYS TO TRY TO
20:11:41  MAKE SURE TRUCKS COME OFF ENCYCLOPEDIA
20:11:44  AND A LOT OF THOSE OTHER ITEMS
THAT MARK HAD
20:11:47  TOUCHED ON.
WE WORKED ON VERY DILIGENTLY
20:11:50  WITH THEM TO PUT THE MOST FLEXIBLE INDUSTRIAL PRODUCT THAT WE
20:11:54  COULD OUT THERE.
MARK HAD TALKED ALSO
20:11:57  ABOUT KIND OF DIVERSITY OF TENANTS.
20:12:01 
WE'RE EXPECTING A DIVERSITY OF TENANTS HERE.
20:12:04 
CITY ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT HAS SOME STATISTICS OF
20:12:07  75% OF
20:12:10  THE INDUSTRIAL LEASES IN FREMONT HAVE BEEN R&D
20:12:13 , ADVANCED MANUFACTURING, TECH, LIFE SCIENCE
20:12:16 S, SO KIND OF THE  NON-DISTRIBUTION USES
AND
20:12:19  THAT'S WHY WE WANT TO BE IN FREMONT.
THERE'S A GREAT TENANT BASE HERE
20:12:22  FOR THAT.
20:12:28 
KEEP GOING BECAUSE I KNOW WE'VE TOUCHED ON SOME OF THIS
20:12:31  STUFF, SOME OF THE SAME PICTURES YOU GUYS HAVE SEEN,
20:12:34  ANOTHER RENDERING THAT MARK HAD SHOWN IN HIS PRESENTATION AND
20:12:37  THIS IS A GOOD PHOTO KIND OF
AS ALL THE COMMISSIONER
20:12:41 S SAW WHEN THEY DROVE BY, KIND OF WHAT THE SITE
20:12:44  CURRENTLY LOOKS LIKE AND WHAT IT'S LOOKED LIKE FOR SOME
20:12:47  TIME VERSUS WHAT IT COULD LOOK LIKE.
WE'RE REALLY EXCITED ABOUT
20:12:50  THAT.
QUICKLY, I'LL
20:12:54  TALK COMMUNITY BENEFITS.
THERE AS MARK MENTIONED
20:12:57  THERE'S AN ECONOMIC ANALYSIS THAT TOUCHES ON THESE AT MUCH
20:13:00  HIGHER DETAIL.
WHAT WE'RE LOOKING
20:13:03  AT 350 TO 400 TEMPORARY
20:13:07  CONSTRUCTION JOBS, I WILL SAY WE ARE WORKING WITH
20:13:10  LOCAL LABOR UNIONS SO THOSE ARE GOING TO BE
20:13:13  PRIMARY UNION JOBS.
300,
20:13:17  TO 600 PERMANENT JOBS DEPENDING ON WHO
20:13:20  THE TENANT IS, IT COULD BE MORE MANUFACTURING WHICH
20:13:23  IS WHAT WE'RE HOPING FOR HERE.
CITY FEES,
20:13:26  $5.5 MILLION GOING TO
20:13:31  THOSE VEHICLES, AFFORDABLE HOUSING, FIRE, SCHOOLS, ET CETERA.
20:13:34 
THOSE TWO NEW TRAFFIC SIGNALS, ONE ON
20:13:37  ENCYCLOPEDIA AND STERCHLZ
20:13:40  AND STEFNEDZ AND
20:13:47  STEVENSON AND ONE ACROSS FROM WALMART.
WE DESIGNED
20:13:50  OUR ROOF FOR FUTURE SOLAR, ABOVE STANDARD
20:13:53  WHAT YOU WOULD DO FOR A TYPICAL TILT-
20:13:56 UP BUILDING.
THE REASON I KNOW THE CHAIR ASKED
20:14:00  WHY ISN'T SOLAR GOING IN YET, UNTIL WE KNOW WHAT THE
20:14:03  TENANT'S POWER NEEDS ARE IT'S MORE DIFFICULT
20:14:06  TO SPECULATE ON HOW MUCH SOLAR
20:14:09  YOU HAVE.
ONCE WE KNOW WHAT OUR POWER NEEDS
20:14:13  AND TENANT NEEDS ARE AND WE CAN
20:14:16  OFFSET THAT'S WHAT WE CAN DO THE SOLAR
20:14:19  DESIGN.
SCAN
20:14:23 NELL SEES US AS FUTURE PARTICIPANTS,
20:14:26  ANOTHER PROJECT IN WARM SPRINGS THAT WE ARE WORKING ON AS WELL
20:14:30 , WE HOPE THIS IS THE FIRST OF A VERY FRUITFUL
20:14:33  RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SCANNELL AND THE CITY OF
FREMONT.
20:14:37 
WE TALKED ABOUT COMMUNITY BENEFITS, VOLUNTARY COMMITMENT AND I
20:14:40  KNOW CHAIR DAULTON HAS
20:14:44  CONCERNS.
WE REALLY HOPE TO BE ABLE TO PUT THAT TO USE
20:14:47  AND WE'RE NOT TRYING TO HOLD IT UNTIL OCCUPANCY.
20:14:50 
ONE THING THAT WE VOLUNTEERED WAS TO SUBMIT
20:14:53  OUR CONTRIBUTION, OUR COMMUNITY BENEFIT, AT BUILDING PERMIT
20:14:57  RATHER THAN TRYING TO HOLD ONTO IT FOR A LONG
20:15:00  TIME, SO IT CAN GET PUT TO USE
20:15:03 .
FINALLY, OUR UNION PARTNERSHIP.
SO OVER THE
20:15:07  LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS WE'VE HAD A LOT OF OUTREACH
20:15:10  AN I'VE
20:15:14  MET WITH LOCAL LABOR  UNIONS, COMMITMENTS
20:15:17  TO USE YOIB I DON'T KNOW LABOR, HIGH
20:15:20  WAGE CONSTRUCTION JOBS, LOCAL
FREMONT JOBS,
20:15:23  THESE TRADES INCLUDE CARPENTRY, M
20:15:27 EPFS AND THE LABOR TRADES.
AS PART OF
20:15:30  THIS AGREEMENT WITH THE CARPENTERS WE'VE COMMITTED TO
20:15:33  A LOCAL APPRENTICE SHIP HIRING PROGRAM
20:15:36  THROUGH MISSION VALLEY ROP, SO I THINK SOME OF
20:15:39  THOSE GROUPS ARE GOING TO BE SPEAKING AS PART OF
THE PUBLIC COMMENT
20:15:42  PERIOD.
THAT IS THE CONCLUSION.
I
20:15:45  AM AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS.
I ALSO HAVE ON THE CALL
20:15:49  OUR CONSULTANTS FROM STRATEGIC ECONOMICS AND
20:15:53  FROM THE TRAFFIC CONSULTANT SO IF THERE ARE QUESTIONS RELATED TO
20:15:56  THAT OR THE OVERALL DESIGN WE HAVE OUR ARCHITECT ON THE CALL
20:16:00  AS
WELL.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   THANK YOU,
20:16:03  MR. CARLSON.
COMMISSIONERS DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FOR
20:16:06  THE APPLICANT?
COMMISSIONER YEE
20:16:09 .
>> Commissioner Yee:   YES, FIRST I WANTED TO APPLAUD THE APPLICANT FOR 
20:16:13 REACHING OUT TO THE LOCAL UNION AND LABOR  PEOPLE, INCLUDING THE
20:16:16   APPRENTICES AT MISSION VALLEY ROP
20:16:19 .
THE OTHER THING I WANTED TO ASK IS, HAVE YOU DONE
20:16:23  ANY OTHER  OUTREACH IN
20:16:26  THE COMMUNITY AS WELT?
20:16:29  WELL?
>> WE HAVE DONE
20:16:32  OUTREACH TO COUNCIL AND TO SOME OF YOU MEMBERS
20:16:35  OF PLANNING COMMISSION.
AND ALSO TO THE NEIGHBORING
20:16:38  RETAILERS, AND
20:16:43  TO NEIGHBORS THAT ARE AFFECTED.
BUT NOT
20:16:46  DIRECTLY -- I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY
20:16:49  THE OTHER OUTREACH YOU'RE REFERRING TO
20:16:52 .
BUT WE'VE BEEN AVAILABLE FOR ANYONE AND WE
20:16:55  WELCOME ANY COLLABORATION WITH THE COMMUNITY.

20:16:59 >> Commissioner Yee:   I GUESS, YOU KNOW, SINCE WE HAD A CHANCE TO
20:17:02  MEET, I THINK ONE THING THAT WAS
20:17:05  UNIQUE TO YOU AS A DEVELOPER WAS TO GO OUT AND TAKE
20:17:08  A LOOK AT SOME OF THE OTHER DEVELOPMENTS THAT WE
HAVE IN THE CITY.

20:17:11 SO I KNOW WHEN I SAW THE INITIAL PICTURES
20:17:16 , ARTIST'S RENDERING
20:17:19 S, I THOUGHT IT WAS INTERESTING
20:17:22 , THE COLOR SCHEME YOU CHOSE IS VERY SIMILAR
20:17:25  TO WHAT WE SEE AT THE WARM SPRINGS
20:17:29  BART STATION RESIDENTIAL
HOUSING.
I WANTED TO SHARE THAT
20:17:32  WITH YOU, AT THE SAME TIME, YOU KNOW, JUST LET THE OTHER COMMISSIONER
20:17:35 S KNOW THAT I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE DONE OUTREACH OUT
20:17:40  THERE.
THE TERM OF WHAT PEOPLE ARE  LOOKING FOR
20:17:44 .
>> THANK YOU.

20:17:48 >> Commissioner Daulton:   ANY OTHER COMMISSIONERS HAVE QUESTIONS FOR THE APPLICANT?

20:17:54 IF NOT, THEN WE CAN MOVE TO
20:17:58  PUBLIC COMMENT. ON THIS ITEM
20:18:01 .
TRISH, CAN YOU TELL ME IF WE HAVE ANY PUBLIC COMMENT ON
20:18:04  THIS ITEM?
>> CHAIR DAULTON, WE HAVE
20:18:07 , I'M GIVING IT A MOMENT.
I DID SEE THREE HANDS
20:18:10  BUT WE HAVE TWO SPEAKERS
20:18:13 .
>> Commissioner Daulton:   ALL RIGHT, WOULD YOU SET THE TIME
20:18:16 ER PLEASE.
>> YES, HOW MANY MINUTES
20:18:19  WOULD YOU LIKE --
>> Commissioner Daulton:   TWO MINUTES.

20:18:22 >> TWO MINUTES, I WILL GO AHEAD AND ADDRESS THE FIRST SPEAKER
20:18:26 .
JASON, YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES.
GO AHEAD AND SPEAK
20:18:31 .
>> ALL RIGHT, GOOD EVENING COMMISSIONERS, CAN YOU HEAR ME
20:18:34 ?
>> YES.
>> THANK YOU.

20:18:37 MY NAME IS JASON LINDSAY.
I'M
20:18:40  HERE TONIGHT REPRESENTING SEVERAL HUNDRED
20:18:43  FREMONT RESIDENTS WHO MAKE THEIR LIVING AS IRONWORK
20:18:47 ERS, SPRINKLER  FITTERS, I'M THE
20:18:50  PRESIDENT OF IRONWORKERS 378 OAKLAND.
I'M
20:18:53  HERE IN SUPPORT OF THIS PROJECT AND ASK YOU TO VOTE FOR
20:18:56  ITS APPROVAL.
THERE HAVE BEEN SOME LOW ROAD
20:19:00  DEVELOPERS THAT HAVE COME TO FREMONT
20:19:03  THAT REFUSE TO COMMIT TO USING UNION WORKFORCE.
THEY
20:19:07  DENY OUR VETERANS WHO ARE NRMD
20:19:10  IN STATE COMMUNICATION
20:19:14 ED PROJECTS, THAT IS NOT WHO
20:19:17   SCAN
20:19:20   SCANNELL IS, THIS DEVELOPER
20:19:24  HAS AGREED TO PAY FAMILY SUPPORTING WAGES AND THEY
20:19:27  WILL HAVE
UNION MEMBERS BUILD
20:19:30  THEIR PROJECT.
THIS IS NOT A SMALL THINGS.

20:19:33 EVERY DEVELOPER WHO COMMITS TO SUCH A
20:19:36  THING, MEANS WE CAN OPEN SLOTS FOR
20:19:39  FREMONT YOUTH AND AT RISK WORKERS.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR
20:19:43  TIME AND APPROVAL OF THIS PROJECT.
>> OKAY, THANK YOU.
I'LL
20:19:46  GO AHEAD AND INTRODUCE THE NEXT SPEAKER.
20:19:50 
SO MARTHA, GO AHEAD AND SPEAK.
THANK YOU
20:19:53 .

20:20:06 MARTHA, I'VE ALLOWED
20:20:09  YOU TO SPEAK.
GO AHEAD.
>> SORRY, I
20:20:12  DIDN'T REALIZE YOU HAVE NOT UNMUTE
20:20:16 ED ME.
MY NAME IS MARTHA
20:20:19 , I LIVE IN FREMONT, THIS IS MY COMMUNITY, I'M SO
20:20:22  EXCITED TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS YOU TONIGHT.
WE'RE A
20:20:26  HUGE SUPPORTER OF UNION WORKERS SO
20:20:29  WE'RE EXCITED THAT YOU
20:20:32  GUYS HAVE A CONTRACT WITH THEM.
A COUPLE OF THINGS I WANT
20:20:36  TO POINT OUT, I'M IN SUPPORT OF COMMISSIONER ZHANG
20:20:40  AND
20:20:43  COMMISSIONER
20:20:47  DAULTON'S
20:20:51   INTERESTS.
IF YOU GO SOUTH OUT
20:20:54  ONTO ENCYCLOPEDIA AND GO A LITTLE BIT NORTH
20:20:57  TOWARDS NEWARK YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT LEVELS OF 93
20:21:01  OUT OF 100 AND 83
20:21:04  OUT OF 100 AND 89 OUT OF 100.

20:21:07 THAT MEANS BABIES ARE
20:21:10  BORN WITH LOW BIRTH RATE AND COVID IS A
20:21:13  BIG DEAL.
I WANTED TO POINT THAT OUT BECAUSE THE GOVERNOR
20:21:16  HAS ASKED US TO GET GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS DOWN TO
20:21:19  ZERO BY 2035.
AND WE HAVEN'T TAKEN THAT INTO ACCOUNT
20:21:22  WITH THIS PROJECT.
SO IF YOU GO AHEAD AND IMPROVE IT,
20:21:26  PLEASE CONSIDER SAYING THE ONLY THING THAT YOU CAN'T DO
20:21:30  HERE IS A LAST-MILE DELIVERY STATION
20:21:33  BECAUSE THOSE TRUCKS WILL GO THROUGHOUT FREMONT.

20:21:36 THEY'LL INCREASE TRAFFIC.
THEY'LL INCREASE COMMUTE TIMES
20:21:39  AND THEY'LL DROP THOSE OFF AND THEY HAVE NO REQUIREMENTS
20:21:42  TO BE ELECTRIC.
THEY CAN BE ANY KIND OF TRUCK AND THEY'LL PUT
20:21:46  THAT INTO OUR HOMES AND INTO OUR  NEIGHBORHOODS.
THIS IS
20:21:50  A PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT SPACE.
A MILE AWAY IS A SCHOOL.
ASSISTED
20:21:53  LIVING.
AND RETIREMENT CENTER.
WHEN YOU COME OUT
20:21:56  ON ENCYCLOPEDIA YOU'RE DIRECTLY ACROSS FROM A
20:22:00  RESIDENTIAL AREA.
AND MY REQUEST FOR ALL OF
20:22:03  US IS THAT WE ARE
20:22:06  REALLY CAREFUL ABOUT THE KINDS OF LEVELS OF VEHICLE  EMISSION
20:22:09 S THAT WE PUT BACK IN THESE COMMUNITIES BECAUSE IT IS
20:22:12  REALLY ADDITIVE.
IT'S NOT A SINGLE PROJECT.
20:22:15 
IT'S NOT JUST EMPLOYEES.
IT'S ADDING IT TO HOW
20:22:18  WE BREATHE AND HOW WE RAISE OUR CHILDREN.
SO I
20:22:22  REALLY, REALLY APPRECIATE IT IF YOU WOULD TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT
20:22:26  AND TRY AND KEEP DOWN THE NO
20:22:29 X FROM DIESEL AND KEEP DOWN THE VEHICLE E
20:22:32 MISSIONS FROM THE CARS AND TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION WHEN WE DO
GO BACK
20:22:35  TO WORK IN THE PANDEMIC WE'LL BE DRIVING
20:22:38  ON THESE STREETS AND IF YOU ADD 50 ABOUT
20:22:42  VEHICLES
20:22:45  EVERY HALF HOUR, AND 76 BAYS
20:22:48  FOR EVERY HALF HOUR FOR TEN HOURS STRAIGHT THEY WILL GO
20:22:52  PAST
OUR SCHOOLS, THEY MAKE IT HARD TO GET
20:22:55  ON TO THE HIGHWAY AND STEVENSON, THEY
20:22:58  MAKE IT HARD TO GET BACK.
WE HAVE A LOT
20:23:02  OF OPTIONS AND I HOPE YOU MAKE ONE THAT IS NOT
20:23:05  SO IMPACTFUL ON HEALTH.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR  LISTENING.
>> 
20:23:08 OKAY, CHAIR DAULTON WE HAVE ANOTHER SPEAKER.
OUR NEXT SPEAKER
20:23:11  IS TIM.
TIM, GO AHEAD AND SPEAK
20:23:14 .
I'VE RELEASED YOU TO SPEAK
20:23:17 .
>> THANK YOU.
GOOD EVENING COMMISSIONERS.

20:23:20 CITY STAFF MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC AND
20:23:23  SCANNELL PROPERTIES.
MY NAME IS
20:23:27  TIM LIP SCOM
20:23:31 .
AND INDUSTRY ADVISORY FOR MISSION VALLEY
20:23:34  ROP WHERE I HELPED PUT TOGETHER AN
20:23:37  AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE CARPENTERS AND MISSION VALLEY
20:23:41  TO PLACE UP TO FIVE SENIORS EACH YEAR AS
20:23:45  FIRST LEVEL APPRENTICES.
BUT THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN IF WE
20:23:48  DO NOT REQUIRE AND GET COMMITMENTS FROM DEVELOPERS TO EMPLOY
20:23:51  CONTRACTORS THAT EMPLOY APPRENTICE
20:23:54 S.
TWO WEEKS AGO WHEN I OPPOSED
20:23:57  THE PROJECT THERE WAS NO SUCH COMMITMENT FROM
20:24:00  SCANNELL PROPERTIES.
I'M PLEASED TONIGHT THAT
20:24:04  THERE IS AN AGREEMENT IN PLACE TO
20:24:07  EMPLOY CARPENTER APRESENCE  TESTS.
WHEN I
20:24:10  MET WITH SCANNELL PROPERTIES,
20:24:14  THEY WERE SUPPORTIVE
20:24:17  OF HIRING LOCALLY SUPPORT APPRENTICE SHIP AND
20:24:20  PROVIDE HEALTH CARE
20:24:23  FOR WORKERS AND THEIR FAMILIES.
I WOULD URGE CITY
20:24:26  LEADERS
20:24:30  TO REQUIRE TO
20:24:33  SUPPORT APRESSURE ADVERTISE SHIP AND PROVIDE HEALTH CARE AND PENSION
20:24:38  FOR  WORKERS.
WE NEED THIS NEXT GENERATION TO REBUILD
20:24:41  OUR CRUMBLING INFRASTRUCTURE.
IF WE DON'T THERE WILL BE
20:24:44  CONTINUED WORKER SHORTAGE OF SKILLED AND TRAINED CONSTRUCTION
20:24:48  WORKERS.
I WOULD URGE THE COMMISSION TONIGHT TO APPROVE
20:24:51  THIS PROJECT AND LET IT MOVE FORWARD.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

20:24:58 >> CHAIR DAULTON, WE DO NOT HAVE ANY MORE SPEAKERS.

20:25:02 >> Commissioner Daulton:   THANK YOU, TRISH.
I BELIEVE
20:25:06  AT THIS TIME WE
20:25:11  ALLOW THE APPLICANT A REBUTTAL PERIOD
20:25:15 .
>> Planner Pullen:   BEFORE WE DO THAT CHAIR, I JUST WANT TO CHECK
20:25:18 .
I DO SEE THERE'S SOMEONE CLASSIFIED
20:25:21  AS AN ATTENDEE, BONNIE
20:25:24  MOSS.
I'M NOT SURE IF SHE'S A SPEAKER OR A
20:25:27  MEMBER OF ONE OF THE TEAMS.
CAN WE CLARIFY, RECORD
20:25:31 ING CLERK?

20:25:35 >> YOU WANT TO HEAR FROM ME?
IS THIS --
20:25:37 
>> Planner Pullen:   I'M NOT SURE IF -- WERE YOU RAISING YOUR HAND TO 
20:25:40 SPEAK?
OR ARE YOU MEMBER OF ONE OF THE PROJECT TEAMS?

20:25:43 >> I'M A MEMBER OF THE SYSTEM.
>> Planner Pullen:   OKAY,  SORRY.

20:25:46 YOU WERE LISTED AS AN ATTENDEE.
20:25:50 
I WANTED TO MAKE SURE IF YOU WEREN'T, IF YOU
20:25:53  WANTED TO.
>> NO PROBLEM
20:25:56 .
>> Commissioner Daulton:   OKAY SO THE APPLICANT HAS FIVE MINUTES TO
20:25:59  REBUT.
ANY PUBLIC COMMENT THERE IF THEY CHOOSE TO.
20:26:02 
>> HI, THIS IS TRISH, I JUST WANTED TO
20:26:05  INTERRUPT REALLY  QUICK.
I KNOW WE USUALLY TAKE A BREAK
20:26:09  ABOUT 8:30.
I KNOW WE'RE CLOSE TO 8:30
20:26:12 .
DO YOU WANT TO DO THAT NOW OR I WASN'T SURE
20:26:15 .
>> Commissioner Daulton:   79 WITH ME, LET'S DO THAT, TEN
20:26:18  MINUTES.
>> OKAY, PLEASE EVERYBODY MAKE SURE YOU TURN OFF
20:26:22  YOUR VIDEO AND MUTE YOURSELF, THANK YOU
20:26:25 .
>> Commissioner Daulton:   SEE YOU IN 10.
20:26:57 
[ RECESS ]
20:28:24 .
20:42:23 >> I THINK ONCE PEOPLE ARE BACK, WE'RE READY
20:42:26  TO GET STARTED
WHEN THEY ARE, CHAIR.

20:42:47 >> Chairman Daulton: TRISH, ARE YOU HERE?
>> I'M HERE.

20:42:50 WE DON'T HAVE ANY MORE SPEAKERS SO WE'RE
20:42:54  READY TO GO.
>> Chairman Daulton: OKAY, SO IF THERE ARE NO MORE
20:43:00  SPEAKERS,
LET'S
20:43:04  SEE, IS EVERYBODY BACK?

20:43:08 SEEMS LIKE IT.
I DON'T THINK WE'RE JUST WAITING FOR CRAIG
20:43:12  NOW.

20:43:15 >> THERE SERVE, WE
20:43:18  HAVE CRAIG BACK IT SAYS THE HOST DISABLED

20:43:21 MAY VIDEO.
>> LET'S
20:43:25  SEE IT SHOULDN'T.

20:43:33 HOW ABOUT NOW?
CAN YOU TURN ON YOUR
20:43:40  VIDEO?
STECKLER LET ME TRY IT AND SEE.
I
20:43:43  GOT IT.
THANK YOU.

20:43:47 >> Chairman Daulton: ALL RIGHT.
IF WE HAVE NO FURTHER SPEAKERS, I
20:43:51  WOULD LIKE TO INVITE THE
APPLICANT BACK
20:43:54  FOR REBUTTAL TO ANYTHING PUBLIC COMMENTS THEY

20:43:57 MAY SEE THE NEED FOR REBUTTING.
>>
20:44:01  SURE.
MAC CARLSEN
20:44:04  AGAIN, SCANNELL PROPERTIES.
I WOULDN'T
20:44:07  CALL IT A REBUTTAL BUT I WOULD
20:44:11  LIKE TO ADDRESS
THE DELIVERY
20:44:14  STATION CONCERNED ADDRESSED THROUGHOUT THIS

20:44:17 MEETING.
HE WOULD CAUTION THE COMMISSION ON A BLANKET OVER ALL

20:44:20 RESTRICTION ON DELIVERY, SIMPLY BECAUSE A LOT
20:44:23  OF THESE
MANUFACTURING TENANTS AND TENANTS THAT ARE
20:44:26  REALLY ATTRACTIVE
FOR THE CITY OF FREMONT,
20:44:29  THEY NEED THE ABILITY TO BRING
TRUCKS IN THEY NEED THE
20:44:33  ABILITY TO MAKE DELIVERIES.
CANDIDLY, THE WAY
20:44:36  THE SITE IS DESIGNED,
20:44:39  WE WORK WITH
ECOMMERCE COMPANIES AND MANUFACTURERS ALL OVER, IT IS NOT
20:44:42  A
SITE THAT IS ATTRACTIVE IN
20:44:45  DESIGN TO AN eCOMMERCE GIANT
LIKE THE ONES YOU
20:44:49  GUYS ARE A LITTLE BIT FEARFUL OF HERE

20:44:53 SIMPLY BECAUSE THERE IS NOT ENOUGH SPACE FOR THEM.
IF
20:44:57  YOU DRIVE BY AMAZON, THEY HAVE A SMALL BUILDING AND BUNCH
OF
20:45:00  PARKING AND I THINK STAFF, ALONG WITH THE APPLICANT, WE
DESIGN
20:45:03  THIS NOT WITH THAT KIND OF USER IN MIND.
IT'S
20:45:06  A LOT HIGHER
20:45:10  COVERAGE, MEANING MORE BUILDING, MORE AREA
FOR SPACE INSIDE THE
20:45:15  BUILDING VERSUS SPACE FOR PARKING
OUTSIDE THE BUILDING, SO THESE
20:45:18  MY ONLY COMMENT I WANTED TO
ADDRESS AND HOPEFULLY CLARIFY A
20:45:22  BIT.
THANK YOU, EVERYONE,
20:45:26  AGAIN.
CAN
20:45:36 S
20:45:42 .
>> CAN WE UNSHARE THE TIMER.

20:45:52 >> COMMISSIONER DAULTON IS
20:45:56  ON MUTE.
>> Chairman Daulton: ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE
20:45:58  COMMISSIONERS
FOR STAFF?
NOBODY?

20:46:06 I WOULD
20:46:11  LIKE TO ASK STAFF, I MEAN, THE
20:46:14  APPLICANT JUST
MENTIONED
20:46:19  -- COMMISSIONER DAULTON, I
20:46:23  THINK COMMISSIONER LIU
HAD HIS
20:46:26  HAND RAISED.
>> Chairman Daulton: I'M SORRY.

20:46:31 GO AHEAD.
>> Commissioner Liu: 
20:46:34 I HAD A
20:46:38  QUESTION FOR THE APPLICANT.
YOU ASKED IF WE HAD
20:46:41  QUESTIONS FOR STAFF.
MY QUESTION IS DIRECTED TO THE APPLICANT.

20:46:44 CAN I ASK THAT?
>> Chairman Daulton: 
20:46:48 YES, I CAN BRING THE APPLICANT BACK.
I'M NOT SURE IF YOU CAN
20:46:51  ASK A QUESTION TO THE UNION REP.
HE'S PART OF
20:46:57  THE PUBLIC COMMENT.

20:46:59 >> Planner Pullen: CHAIR DAULTON, WE DID NOT FORMERLY CLOSE
THE PUBLIC HEARING.

20:47:02 I DON'T REMEMBER YOU SAYING THAT.
SO IF WE WANT TO GO BACK
20:47:06  AND TALK TO THE APPLICANT AFTER THE
REBUTTAL, WE CAN
20:47:09  ASK QUESTIONS.
I DON'T THINK IT WOULD BE
20:47:12  OKAY TO GO BACKS TO THE PUBLIC
UNLESS YOU
20:47:16  INVITED EVERYONE TO SPEAK.
>> Chairman Daulton: THAT'S FINE.

20:47:19 GO AHEAD.
>> Commissioner Liu: IT IS AN OBSERVATION.

20:47:22 IT IS A PLEASANT SURPRISE TO SEE THE OBJECTION FROM THE

20:47:26 UNION REPS FROM THE LAST MEETING
20:47:29  WAS DROPPED AND COMPLETELY
REVERSED.

20:47:32 AND I'M VERY GLAD THAT THE
20:47:36  APPLICANT AND THE UNION FOLKS
20:47:39  CAN
ACTUALLY REACH SOME KIND
20:47:42  OF AGREEMENT.
AND, AS A RESULT, THE
20:47:46  UNION REPS WERE, ARE NOW COMPLETELY

20:47:50 SUPPORTIVE OF THAT PROJECT NOW.

20:47:53 SO, MY QUESTION
20:47:57  IS, WAS THE DIFFERENCE IN THE FIRST ROUND

20:48:01 BEFORE THE LAST
20:48:05  MEETING SO HUGE AND THE BUDDER FROM THE
DEMANDS FROM
20:48:08  THE UNION SO
20:48:11  INSURE MOUNTABLE THAT NO AGREEMENT
COULD BE REACHED TO
20:48:16  THE POINT WHERE THE
20:48:20  UNION HAD TO SPEAK UP
SO LOUDLY AGAINST THAT
20:48:23  PROJECT.
CAN YOU WALK ME THROUGH THE PROCESS?

20:48:27 WHAT WAS THE MAIN -- WHAT WAS THE KEY IN RESOLVING
20:48:30  THAT
DIFFERENCE?
I MEAN, FROM JUDGING FROM WHAT THE
20:48:33  UNION SAID TODAY, IT'S
ONLY
20:48:37  PLACING FIVE APPRENTICES TO
20:48:40  THE BUILDING PROJECT.

20:48:45 RIGHT?
THAT JUST DIDN'T SEEM TO BE A
20:48:48  HUGE BURDEN TO ME, BUT PERHAPS
THEY REDUCED
20:48:51  THEIR DEMANDS FROM THE FIRST ROUND?

20:48:54 WHAT WAS THE KEY DIFFERENCE?
>> SURE.

20:48:57 SO, FIRST OF ALL, WE WEREN'T IN
20:49:00  COLLABORATION WITH THEM
PRIOR TO HEARING FROM
20:49:04  THEM ON THAT FIRST ROUND.
SO AFTER THAT HAPPENED,
20:49:07  I APPROACHED THE DIFFERENCE TRADE
UNIONS AND WE MET AND
20:49:10  WE TALKED ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE ASKING
FOR IT.
IS A
20:49:14  LOT MORE THAN FIVE
20:49:18  APPRENTICESHIP JOBS, THAT'S JUST
APART FROM THE
20:49:22  ROP.
WE WILL HAVE FULL SIGNATORY SUB CON TRACTORS
20:49:25  SO ALL THE WORK
ON THE PROJECT FOR THOSE TRADE WILL BE UNION
20:49:28  JOBS SO IT IS
HUNDREDS OF UNION JOBS, NOT
20:49:32  JUST A
20:49:36  COUPLE.
THEY DID FEEL STRONGLY AND CARE ABOUT I CAN
20:49:39  AND WE DO, TOO,
SUPPORTINGS MISSION OF THE
20:49:42  ROP, BUT THAT'S JUST A PART OF
THE TOTAL PROCESS AND
20:49:45  AGREEMENT.
>> I SEE.
SO IT SEEMS THAT YOU DID
20:49:49  MAKE SOME MAJOR CONCESSIONS THERE
IN
20:49:52  WORKING AND AGREEING TO WORKING, TO
20:49:55  WORK WITH THE UNIONS.
>> YES, I
20:49:58  WOULD SAY VERY MUCH.

20:50:02 >> ANY OTHER
20:50:05  QUESTIONS FROM COMMISSIONERS TO STAFF.
OR
20:50:08  THE APPLICANT.

20:50:11 I GUESS I WOULD ASK THE APPLICANT A
20:50:15  QUESTION.
SO, MR. CARLSEN, IF
20:50:19  YOU DON'T THINK THAT A LAST--MILE

20:50:22 DELIVERY SERVICE ON THE ORDER
20:50:26  OF AMAZON IS LIKELY TO LEASE

20:50:29 THIS PIECE OF PROPERTY, THEN WHY DO YOU CARE
20:50:33  IF WE PUT
RESTRICTION UPON THOSE TYPES OF BUSINESSES
20:50:36  ON THIS PROPERTY?

20:50:39 >> I THINK I ADDRESSED IT A LITTLE
20:50:42  BIT.
IT'S NOT THAT WE'RE --
20:50:46  WE, AND STAFF I THINK, AS WELL, WE
WANT THIS TO BE A
20:50:50  FLEXIBLE I.T.-TYPE PROJECT.
IT'S
20:50:53  NOT, YOU CAN'T DEVELOP PROJECT AND SAY IT HAS TO
20:50:56  BE
THIS EXACT ICE BECAUSE WE'RE BUILDING THESE TO BE
20:51:00  FLEXIBLE
AND WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A
20:51:03  MIXES OF TENANTS.
BUT I THINK I'M
20:51:06  CONFIDENT IT IS NOT GOING TO BE ONE SINGLE

20:51:09 DELIVERY SERVICE COMPANY.
I CAN'T SAY
20:51:12  THAT, YOU KNOW, AND WE DO
20:51:16  STRONGLY FEEL THAT
FLEXIBILITY IS COMPLETELY NECESSARY
20:51:19  TO MEET THE MARKET
DEMANDS AND I THINK
20:51:22  THE DATA SHOWS THE MARKET DEMANDS ARE
MORE FOR
20:51:25  A MANUFACTURING,
20:51:28  LIFE SCIENCE, R&D TYPE TENANT BASE
THAN THEY ARE
20:51:32  FOR LAST-MAIL DELIVERY.
>> BUT IN THAT REGARD,
20:51:35  DENYING A CERTAIN TYPE OF
20:51:38  USE ON
THAT, IN THAT
20:51:41  PROJECT, WOULD NOT LIMIT IT TO A SINGLE KIND
OF USE.

20:51:44 IT WOULD STILL ALLOW FOR A WIDE RANGE OF USES OF
20:51:48  YOUR
PROJECT.

20:51:53 >> IT LIMITS THE FLEXIBILITY.
>>
20:51:56  OKAY.
ALL RIGHT.
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS.

20:52:01 COMMISSIONERS?
ALL RIGHT.
IN THAT
20:52:04  CASE, WE ARE GOING TO CLOSE THE
20:52:08  PUBLIC HEARING.

20:52:13 AND, ENTER THE DELIBERATION PERIOD
20:52:17  AMONG OUR COMMISSION.

20:52:21 DOES ANYONE HAVE A COMMENT?
OR FURTHER
20:52:24  QUESTIONS OF STAFF OR COMMENT
20:52:28  REGARDING THIS
PROJECT?
THIS
20:52:32  APPLICANT?
ANYONE?
YES,
20:52:36  COMMISSIONER ZHANG.
>> Commissioner Zhang: I'M
20:52:39  READING THE CONDITIONAL APPROVAL
DOC
20:52:43  ABOUT THE TRANSPORTATION
20:52:46  CONDITIONS.
ITEM D-4.

20:52:49 IT MENTIONS
20:52:53  THE IMAGINE MAN STREET.

20:52:56 IT IS HARD TO IMAGINE, WHERE THIS
20:53:00  MAN STREET IS
20:53:04 .
>> THANK YOU FOR THE
20:53:07  QUESTION.
MAIN STREET IS THE INTERIOR CONNECTION FROM THE
20:53:10  PROJECT
SIDE.
IT CURRENTLY RUNS BETWEEN TWO 
20:53:13 BUILDINGS THAT MAKE UP THE
DEVELOPED PORTION
20:53:16  OF THE GLOBE.
>> Commissioner Zhang: I SEE.

20:53:20 THE OTHER QUESTION I HAD IS ABOUT THE
20:53:24  SEGREGATION BETWEEN
THE GLOBE AND
20:53:27  THE SITE.
THE CONDITIONAL
20:53:30  APPROVAL MENTIONED THERE WON'T BE ANY CROSS

20:53:33 LINK WALLS?
I WONDER,
20:53:37  WHAT WOULD BE THE -- HOW THE SIDE
20:53:40  AND THE GLOBE
ARE SEGREGATED?
WILL THERE
20:53:43  BE JUST OPEN SPACE OR WHAT DOES
20:53:47  IT LOOK LIKE?
>> THERE WOULD BE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN
20:53:50  THE BUILT-OUT PORTION
OF THE GLOBE AND THE PROJECT SEAT,
20:53:53  BUT THOSE CONNECTIONS
WOULD BE
20:53:57  ESSENTIALLY A CONTINUATION OF A PARKING FIELD SO

20:54:01 THERE'S SUITABLE SEPARATION MEAN THE BUILDINGS OF THE GLOBE
AND
20:54:04  THE PROPOSED BUILDINGS.
BUT THERE
20:54:07  WOULD NOT BE ANY TYPE OF LIKE
20:54:11  PERIMETER WALL OR
OTHER PHYSICAL BOUNDARY THAT WOULD RESTRICT
20:54:14  ACCESS FROM ONE
SITE TO THE OTHER.
THEY WOULD BE
20:54:17  INTERCONNECTED.
>> Commissioner Zhang: I SEE.
THANK YOU.

20:54:29 >> Chairman Daulton: SORRY, COMMISSIONER YEE.
>> Commissioner Yee: THANK
20:54:32  YOU, AT LEAST NOW YOU SAW MY
HAND.

20:54:36 EVERYBODY IS TALKING ABOUT THIS BEING A
20:54:39  LAST--MILE FACILITY,
BY KNOW WHEN I
20:54:43  LOOK AT THIS, AT THESE
20:54:47  BUILDINGS, IT REMINDS
ME WHEN I HAD MY OWN ADVANCED
20:54:50  MANUFACTURING COMPANY AND THE
BUILDING I WAS IN WAS A
20:54:54  SIMILAR SIZE AND DEAL MARKET
INDICATED IN DRUGSES WITH IT WITH
20:54:57  A LOT OF
20:55:00  BASE, AS WELL
20:55:10 .
I STARTED SMALL AND WAS ABLE TO EXPAND AND TAKE
20:55:13  ANOTHER BAY
AND ANOTHER BAY AND ANOTHER BAY.
THEN, WHEN
20:55:16  I TALKED TO THE BUSINESS OWNERS IN THE AREA, YOU
KNOW,
20:55:19  THIS PROJECT WOULD HELP THEM KEEP
20:55:22  THEIR, YOU KNOW,
KEEP THESE RESTAURANTS IN THE
20:55:25  AREA SURVIVING, BECAUSE, YOU
KNOW, I'VE
20:55:28  BEEN OUT THERE SEVERAL TIMES.
I'VE BEEN
20:55:31  A CUSTOMER AT A NUMBER OF THOSE RESTAURANTS, AND
UNFORTUNATELY,
20:55:35  RETAIL AS WE ALL SEE IT, WE START TO SEE MORE
AND MORE OF
20:55:38  THESE RETAIL SITES CLOSING AND THEY HAVE THAT

20:55:41 SAME PROBLEM OVER THERE, AS WELL.
AND THEN,
20:55:44  ONLY A FEW WEEKS AGO, YOU KNOW, 11 OF THE
20:55:47 
BUSINESSES WERE BROKEN INTO BECAUSE OF WHAT'S BEEN
20:55:51  GOING ON
THROUGHOUT THE REGION.
AND, YOU
20:55:54  KNOW, THEY'RE STRUGGLING.
AND I COULD SEE THAT IF
20:55:57  WE BRING IN, YOU KNOW, THIS KIND OF
BUILDING,
20:56:00  THIS KIND OF DESIGN WITH FLEXIBILITY TO HAVE
ADVANCED
20:56:04  MANUFACTURING, BIOTECH AND THE LAKE, THE BUSINESS
OWNERS AS
20:56:07  I SPOKE TO THEM, THEY WELCOMED THE IDEA OF
20:56:10  HAVING
WORKERS RIGHT NEXT DOOR TO THEM, THEY CAN JUST
20:56:13  WALK TO THEIR

20:56:17 BUSINESS.
THAT'S ALL I
20:56:20  NEED SAY RIGHT NOW.
>> Chairman Daulton: ANY OTHER COMMENTS FROM
20:56:24  COMMISSIONERS?
COMMISSIONER YEE IN REGARDS TO YOUR COMMENTS, I WOULD SAY

20:56:28 THAT I DEFINITELY WOULD LOVE TO SEE THOSE
20:56:31  KINDS OF
BUSINESSES MOVE INTO
20:56:35  THIS PROJECT.

20:56:39 I THINK THAT -- I THINK, THOUGH THAT IT WOULD BE
20:56:43  FAR MORE
PROBLEMATIC TO HAVE
20:56:46  THESE KINDS OF LAST--MILE
20:56:49  DELIVERY
BUSINESS IN THIS
20:56:52  SPACE.
PARTLY BECAUSE TRADITIONALLY,
20:56:56  THOSE DRIVERS AREN'T
20:57:00 
EMPLOYEES, AND SO THEY'RE NOT
20:57:03  MAYBE GETTING THEIR LUNCH ON
SITE THERE IN THE
20:57:07  SURROUNDING AREA.
I THINK PART OF THE
20:57:10  PROBLEM WITH THAT GLOBE PROJECT IN THE

20:57:14 FIRST PLACE IS IT'S KIND OF SUB STANDARD.
NO OFFENSE
20:57:17  TO ANYBODY WHO EVER BUILT THAT THING, BUT IT IS
NOT MUCH
20:57:20  TO LOOK AT, FRANKLY, SO MAYBE IT IS LACK OF
20:57:23  QUALITY
IN SOME WAYS HAS CAUSED IT TO
20:57:26  RUN DOWN, WHICH IT IS A BIT
RUN DOWN OVER
20:57:31  THERE.
SO, I WOULD SAY THAT IN A WAY, IF WE
20:57:34  DID PUT A CONDITION ON
THIS PROPERTY, THAT MAYBE
20:57:38  WE COULD ENCOURAGE THE KINDS OF
BUSINESSES THAT
20:57:41  YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT RATHER THAN
20:57:45  THOSE THAT
MAY CAUSE LARGE-SCALE TRAFFIC
20:57:48  ISSUES AND OTHER ISSUES
BROUGHT FORTH BY
20:57:51  THE SIERRA CLUB PEOPLE.

20:58:00 SO, WITH THAT, I'M GOING TO MAKE A NOTION APPROVE THIS

20:58:04 PROJECT ON THE CONDITIONS WE RESTRICT
20:58:07  LAST--MILE DELIVERY
BUSINESSES.
SEE HOW THAT
20:58:11  FLIES.

20:58:21 >> Planner Pullen: CHAIR DAULTON I CAN I DON'T KNOW IF THERE
IS -- I PROBABLY SHOULDN'T
20:58:24  HAVE JUMPED IN BUFFER GOT A
SECOND OR
20:58:27  NOT, BUT I WANT TO CLARIFY.
YOU SAID A MOTION TO
20:58:30  RESTRICT.
>> A MOTION TO APPROVE
20:58:33  THE PROJECT WITH THE CONDITION WE
RESTRICT
20:58:36  LAST--MILE DELIVERY BUSINESSES FROM THIS PROJECT.

20:58:50 >> Planner Pullen: SO NONE OF THEM, NOT A

CLAMORING

THE NEXT ITEM ON THE
21:01:23  AGENDA, ITEM 2, IS THE 2021 HOUSING
ELEMENT
21:01:26  ANNUAL PROGRESS REPORT.

21:01:30  AN ANNUAL REPORT ON
THE STATUS OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE
21:01:33  GENERAL PLAN AND THE

21:01:36 2015-2023 HOUSING ELEMENT, AND TO
21:01:39  CONSIDER AN EXEMPTION FROM
THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE CALIFORNIA
21:01:42  ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY
21:01:46 
ACT, PURSUANT TO CEQA GUIDELINES SECTION
21:01:49  15378.
IN TERMS OF INTRODUCING THE ITEM, WE HAVE
21:01:53  PLANNERS HERE.
IT IS KNOWN AS THE 2021 CALENDAR REPORT,
21:01:56  BECAUSE IT IS THE
LAST CALENDAR YEAR, EVEN THOUGH WE ARE
21:01:59  IN 2022 NOW.
THE PROJECT PLANNERS HERE TO TALK ABOUT THE ITEM
21:02:03  ARE ON YOUR
SCREEN THERE.

21:02:07 SO THEY HAVE A PRESENTATION FOR
21:02:12  YOU.
THIS IS SORT OF MOMENTOUS.
IT'S THE
21:02:15  LAST HOUSING ELEMENT ANNUAL PROGRESS REPORT BEFORE
WE HAVE
21:02:18  A NEW HOUSING ELEMENT.
THE HOUSING ELEMENT WILL BE COMING
21:02:21  TO YOU LATER, BUT WE'RE
HERE TONIGHT
21:02:25  REPORTING ON OUR PROGRESS TODAY.
GO
21:02:28  AHEAD, PLANNERS.

21:02:35 >> GOOD EVENING, PLANNING
21:02:40  COMMISSIONERS.
THE
21:02:44  ITEM BUFFER IS THE HOUSING ELEMENT ANNUAL
21:02:47  PROGRESS
REPORT FOR 2021.
THIS IS HOUSING
21:02:51  DEVELOPMENTS, IMPLEMENTATION OF HOUSING

21:02:55 ELEMENT PROGRAMS.
TONIGHT'S PRESENTATION IS
21:02:58  GOING TOAPHOBES CAN YOU ON THE
CURRENT REGIONAL HOUSING NEED
21:03:02  ALLOCATION, ALSO CALLED
21:03:08  RHNA

21:03:12 TO 2023.
IT INCLUDES AN OVER VIEW OF THE
21:03:15  CITY'S PROGRESS AND STATUS
UPDATE OF THE
21:03:18  GENERAL PLAN LAST YEAR.
SINCE 1980, STATE LAW
21:03:22  REQUIRES LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO
PROVIDE FOR THEIR FAIR SHARE OF
21:03:25  THE REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS.
DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING
21:03:28  AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT,
21:03:33  HCD
DETERMINES HOUSING NEEDS AND THE ASSOCIATION OF AREA
21:03:36 
GOVERNMENTS IS RESPONSIBLE TO
21:03:40  ASSIGNING A RHNA IN
21:03:44  THE AREA.
THEY HAVE SET THE FAIR SHARE OF
21:03:47  NEED AT 5,455 UNITS.
THIS IS
21:03:50  THE SECOND LARGEST NUMBER IN THE
21:03:54  ALAMEDA COUNTY
BEHIND OAKLAND AND REPRESENTING 20% OF
21:03:57  THE RHNA ALLOCATION

21:04:00 WHICH IS CONSIST DON'T WITH THE
21:04:03  COUNTY'S POPULATION.
DIVIDED INTO FOUR SUB CATEGORIES
21:04:08  BASED ON LEVELS, ROUGHLY A
THIRD OF THE
21:04:11  ALLOCATION IS ABOVE THE MODERATE INCOME
21:04:14  LEVELS
AND REMAINING TWO-THIRDSES IS FOR THE VERY
21:04:17  LOW, LOW AND
MODERATE INCOME LEVELS.
IT IS WORTH
21:04:21  TO NOTE THAT THE LAW REQUIRES THAT LOCAL

21:04:24 GOVERNMENTS AS ADEQUATELY PLAN TO MEET THE EXISTING AND

21:04:28 PROJECTED HOUSING NEEDS.
UPON REVIEW AND CERTIFICATION OF
21:04:31  THE HOUSING ELEMENT BY HCD,

21:04:35 LOCAL JURISDICTIONS APPLY FOR STATE AND
21:04:38  FEDERAL HOUSING AID
GRANTS.
THIS SLIDE
21:04:41  SHOWS HOW MANY NEW UNITS HAVE BEEN
21:04:45  ISSUES DURING
THE CURRENT RHNA CYCLE.
AS
21:04:48  OF 2021, THE CITY HAS ISSUED MORE BUILDING
21:04:52  PERMITS THAN
THE ORIGINAL RHNA ALLOCATION.
SO FARR
21:04:55  A TOTAL OF 7,090 UNITS RECEIVED BUILDING
21:04:59  PERMITS
WHICH REPRESENTS APPROXIMATELY 130% OF
21:05:02  THE CITY'S TOTAL RHNA
ALLOCATION.
THE AMOUNT
21:05:05  OF AFFORDABLE HOUSINGS PRODUCED REMAINS
SIGNIFICANTLY
21:05:08  LESS THAN THE CITY'S ALLOCATED RHNA
21:05:12  TARGETS
FOR VERY LOW, LOW AND MODERATE INCOME
21:05:15  UNITS.
IN
21:05:19  2021, A TOTAL OF 861 NEW HOUSING
21:05:22  UNITS RECEIVING ABOUT
PERMITS.
ISSUED BUILDING
21:05:26  PERMITS ACTIVITY AND HOUSING PRODUCTION WERE
MOST STRONGLY
21:05:30  CONCENTRATED IN THE WARM SPRINGS, SOUTH
FREMONT
21:05:33  INNOVATION DISTRICT IN 2021, APPROXIMATELY 56%
21:05:36  OF
THE NEW UNITS THAT RECEIVED BUILDING
21:05:39  PERMIT WERE IN THE WARM
SPRINGS INNOVATION DISTRICT.

21:05:42 THERE HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANT BUILDING PERMIT ACTIVITY IN WARM

21:05:45 SPRINGS OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS.
THE BUILDING PERMIT ACTIVITY
21:05:49  IN WARM SPRINGS SLOWED IN 2020,

21:05:53 PARTIALLY DUE TO
21:05:57  THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC BUT RECOVERED IN 201.
THE
21:06:00  WARM SPRINGS INNOVATION DISTRICT WILL SLOW DOWN IN
UPCOMING YEARS AS
21:06:04  THE MAJORITY OF THE 4,000 RESIDENTIAL
UNITS
21:06:08  ENTITLED IN WARM SPRINGS HAVE ALREADY RECEIVED
BUILDING PERMITS BY
21:06:11  NOW.
I'M GOING TO TURN OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE COURTNEY TO TALK

21:06:14 ABOUT HOUSING PRODUCTIONS UNDER THE CITY'S
21:06:17  CURRENT POLICIES
IN MORE DETAILS.
>>
21:06:21  THANKS, HANG.
GOOD EVENING, COMMISSIONERS.
COMMISSION TO THE
21:06:24  RAW PERMITTING NUMBERS OUR ANNUAL PROGRESS
REPORT
21:06:27  ALSO HIGHLIGHTS THE CITY'S POLICIES RELATED TO

21:06:30 HOUSING.
THESE UPDATES CAN BE FOUND IN
21:06:33  TABLE D IN EXHIBIT B OF YOUR
PACK ACCOUNT
21:06:37  TONIGHT.
A NUMBER OF POLICYINGS PERTAIN TO THE CREATION OF NEW

21:06:40 AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS THIS SLIDE SHOWS AN OVERVIEW
21:06:43  OF
AFFORDABLE HOUSING
21:06:47  PRODUCTION 2021.
THE TABLE AT THE TOP OF THE PAGE SHOWS AFFORDABLE
21:06:50  HOUSING
PROJECTS THAT HAVE APPROVED ENTITLEMENTS THAT ARE
21:06:53  CURRENTLY
UNDER GOING BUILDING PERMIT REVIEW.
YOU CAN
21:06:57  SEE THROUGH PROJECTS WITH A TOTAL OF 292
21:07:00  UNITS
CLIENT BEING REVIEWED BY CITY STAFF.
THE SECOND TABLE
21:07:03  SHOPS AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS THAT HAVE
BEEN PERMITTED OR COMPLETED
21:07:07  IN 2021.
THE GRANITE RIDGE AND
21:07:12  IRVINGTON SENIOR PROJECTS RECEIVES
PERMITS
21:07:15  IN 2021 AND THE CITY
21:07:20  OTHER PROJECTS ALL COMPLETED
CONSTRUCTION IN 2021.
BY
21:07:23  THE END OF 2021,S CITY HAS
21:07:27  PRODUCED APPROXIMATELY 28% OF
ITS BELOW MARKET RATE HOUSING
21:07:31  NEEDSES AND HAS APPROXIMATELY
8% OF IS TOTAL
21:07:34  NEED IN THE PIPELINE.
THAT MEANS THAT 64% OF THE REMAINING
21:07:37  NEED FOR AFFORDABLE
HOUSING IS CURRENTLY UNMET.

21:07:40 IN ORDER TO HELP ADDRESS THAT UNMET NEED
21:07:44  IN 2021, THE CITY
ISSUED A NOTICE OF
21:07:47  FUNDING AVAILABILITY, OR NOFA,
21:07:51  FOR
$45,000 FOR ADDITIONAL HOUSING DEVELOPMENT
21:07:57  CITY COUNCIL
AUTHORIZED THREE
21:08:01  PROJECTS
21:08:05  FOR ADDITIONAL HOUSING PROJECTS
ONCE THOSE ARE
21:08:09  COMPLETE.
ANOTHER KEY HOUSING POLICY AREA IS
21:08:12  THE ACCESSORY DWELLING
UNITS, OR
21:08:15  ADUs.
AFTER A SLIGHT INCREASE IN 2020, THE NUMBER INCREASED
21:08:19  IN
2021 TO A RECORD HIGH
21:08:22  OF 77.
THE CITY CONTINUES TO PROMOTE POLICIES THAT
21:08:25  ENCOURAGE AND
SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF ADUs.

21:08:29 IN 2021, THE CITY LAUNCHED A PREAPPROVED ADU PROGRAM
21:08:33  THAT
ALLOWS DESIGNERS TO HAVE A GENERIC DECEMBER, TACHED
21:08:36  ADU PLAN
APPROVED FOR USE THROUGHOUT THE CITY.
THERE ARE CURRENTLY
21:08:39  TWO ADU PLANS WITH THE PREAPPROVAL
DESIGNATION
21:08:42  AND MORE THAN 12 IN THE PREAPPROVAL PIPELINE.

21:08:46 HOMEOWNERS WHO USE A PREAPPROVED ADU DESIGN GET
21:08:49  ACCESS TO A
SHORTENED REVIEW TIME ANTE CREASED
21:08:52  PERMITTING FEES TO HELP
ENCOURAGE ADU
21:08:57  PRODUCTION.
THE ANNUAL PROGRESS REPORT HAS NUMBER OF OTHER
21:09:01  REPORTING
REQUIREMENTS GENERALLY
21:09:05  CONTAINED IN PAGES E-H IN THE ANNUAL
HOUSING REPORT
21:09:08  TABLES.
THEY CAN BE FOUND AS EXHIBIT B TO YOUR STAFF REPORT THIS

21:09:11 EVENING AND WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTION US
MIGHT HAVE
21:09:14  ON THEM.
ONE FINAL REPORTING
21:09:17  REQUIREMENT I WOULD LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT IN
THE PROSE
21:09:20  ENTATION TONIGHT SPECIFICALLY IS THE GENERAL
21:09:23  PLAN
REPORT FOUND IN EXHIBIT A.
THE
21:09:27  GENERAL PLAN REPORT DETAILS THE DETAILS AND OTHER
ELEMENTS
21:09:30  OF THE GENERAL PLAN, AS WELL AS CHANGES TO THE
GENERAL
21:09:34  PLAN MADE IN THE PAST YEAR.
PER STATE LAW, NO MANDATORY ELEMENT
21:09:37  OF THE GENERAL PLAN MAY
BE AMENDED MORE THAN FOUR
21:09:40  TIMES PER YEAR.
TWO RESOLUTIONS AMENDING THE GENERAL
21:09:44  PLAN WERE APPROVED IN
2021.
THE FIRST WAS A GENERAL
21:09:47  PLAN AMENDMENT TO CHANGE THE HAND
USE DESIGNATION OF
21:09:50  AN APPROXIMATELY SIX ACRE SITE IN
21:09:54  NILES
FROM SERVICE INDUSTRIAL TO LOW MEDIUM RESIDENTIAL
21:09:58  TO
FACILITATE A PROJECT KNOWN AS THE
21:10:01  NILES GATEWAY PROJECT.
THE SECOND WAS A
21:10:05  CITY-INITIATED AMENDMENT THAT MAIN MINOR
AMENDMENTS TO THE LAND
21:10:08  USE MAP TO MORE ACCURATELY REFLECT
CONDITIONS AND USES ON
21:10:11  THOSE SITES.
THAT
21:10:14  CONCLUDES OUR REVIEW OF THE GENERAL PLAN AND
21:10:16  HOUSING
ELEMENT ANNUAL PROGRESS REPORTS.

21:10:20 TONIGHT STAFF RECOMMENDS THE PLANNING COMMISSION RECOMMEND
THE
21:10:23  CITY COUNCIL FIRST FIND THE ANNUAL REPORT
21:10:26  IS NOT SUGGEST
TO CEQA AND
21:10:31  SECOND, ACCEPTS SENTS A AND B WHICH DEPICT
21:10:34  THE
CURRENT STATUS OF THE GENERAL PLAN AND HOUSING ELEMENT, AND

21:10:38 DIRECT STAFF TO SUBMIT THE REQUIRED MATERIALS TO THE
21:10:41  OPR AND
HCD.
STAFF MUST SUBMIT THE
21:10:44  ANNUAL REPORT TO THE STATE BY APRIL 1,

21:10:47 2022, TO BE IN COMPLIANCE WITH HOUSING ELEMENT LAW.
THAT CONCLUDES OUR
21:10:51  PRESENTATION THIS EVENING.
HANG AND I ARE NOW AVAIL
21:10:54  BE FOR ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT.
HAVE IN ADDITION OUR PRINCIPLE
21:10:58  PLANNER LEE IS HERE AND IS
AVAILABLE FOR ANY QUESTIONS.
THANK
21:11:02  YOU.

21:11:09 >> Chairman Daulton: THANK YOU, MISS POWELL.
I'M UNCLEAR, DO
21:11:12  WE GO TO PUBLIC COMMENT AT THIS POINT OR DO
WE INVITE
21:11:15  QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMISSION?
>> Planner Pullen: CHAIR, YOU COULD, IF
21:11:18  YOU WANTED, IF YOU
HAD ANY CLARIFYING QUESTIONS
21:11:22  OF STAFF, JUST KIND OF LIMITED,
IT
21:11:25  WOULD BE APPROPRIATE AT THIS TIME FROM THE COMMISSION.
BUT
21:11:29  IF NOT, TO THE PUBLIC.
>> Chairman Daulton: DO WE HAVE ANY
21:11:32  CLARIFYING QUESTIONS
FROM THE COMMISSION
21:11:36  THEN?
COMMISSIONER YEE.
>> Commissioner Yee: YES, WHEN I WAS 
21:11:40 LOOKING AT THE STAFF
REPORT, I NOTICED THAT THERE WAS A
21:11:43  SECTION FOR CONDO
CONVERSIONS,
21:11:47  ALLOCATION, AND I COULD SEE THAT ALL THE WAY
BACK
21:11:50  TO 2017 WE HAD 100 UNITS, HUNDRED
21:11:54  UNITS, BEHIND
UNITS, IS THERE ANYTHING WE'RE GOING TO DO WITH
21:11:57  THAT
ALLOCATION BECAUSE IT KEEPS SHOWING UP WE HAVE AN
21:12:00  ALLOCATION
BUT WE HAVE NOTHING TO SHOW FOR IT.
IT LOOKS LIKE IT IS GOING
21:12:03  TO EVENTUALLY INCREASE TO 200.

21:12:07 >> I'LL JUST TRY TO ANSWER THAT FIRST.
SO, OUR
21:12:10  ZONING CODE ACTUALLY CAP THE NUMBER OF
21:12:13  CONDOS CAN BE
CONVERTED EVERY YEAR TO A HUNDRED
21:12:17  UNITS, AND ONLY WHEN THE
VACANCY RATE IS
21:12:20  OVER 5%.
WE CAN'T ROLL OVER THE ALLOCATION TO
21:12:23  THE NEXT YEAR.
HOWEVER, IF THE NEXT
21:12:27  YEAR, WHICH IS IN 2020, WE HAVE
21:12:31  OVER 5%
VACANCY RATE, WE ROLL OVER THE ALLOCATION.

21:12:34 AND THIS YEAR, AGAIN, WE HAVE ANOTHER 5%,
21:12:37  OVER 5% VACANCY
RATE THEN A WE CAN ONLY ROLL OVER FROM
21:12:40  THE PREVIOUS YEAR BUT
NOT FROM THE 2019.

21:12:44 SO, EVERY YEAR, WE'RE BASICALLY CAPPED
21:12:47  AT 200.
THERE IS NO WAY TO GO
21:12:50  OVER 200.
I HOPE
21:12:54  THAT'S CLEAR
21:13:00 .
>> IT WAS DURING THE TIME WE HAD THE
21:13:04  RECESSION AND WHEN THE
HOUSING MARKET
21:13:09  TANKED.
APARTMENTS -- ACTUALLY, I'M SORRY.
PRIOR TO THE HOUSING
21:13:12  MARKET TANKING, WITH THE
21:13:15  HOUSING MARKET
RISING, APARTMENT
21:13:18  OWNERS DECIDED TO CONVERT THEIR APARTMENTS

21:13:22 INTO CONDO
21:13:27 .
THAT WENT AWAY BECAUSE THE MARKET
21:13:30  TANKED AND THEN RENTALS
WENT UP, ACTUALLY.
SO I
21:13:33  DON'T SEE, IN THE NEAR FUTURE, AT ALL BECAUSE WE
21:13:36  HAVE A
REALLY STRONG RENTAL MARKET CURRENTLY THAT THE COMMISSION

21:13:39 WILL BE SEEING ANY CONDO
21:13:43  CONVERSION.
BUT THE INTENT IS VERY CLEAR, AS HANG
21:13:46  MENTIONED, TO LIMIT
THE NUMBER OF CONVERSIONS THAT WE WOULD
21:13:49  HAVE BEEN SEEING IF
THE MARKET CONTINUED TO
21:13:53  CLIMB.
SO, BUT IT HASN'T OCCURRED.
>> OKAY SO
21:13:56  IT WAS JUST THERE JUST IN CASE.
>>
21:14:00  RIGHT.
YEAH.
BECAUSE RENTAL HOUSING IS VERY 
21:14:03 IMPORTANT BE FOR THE CITY.
YOU HAVE TO HAVE A BALANCE OF BOTH,
21:14:07  FOR SALE AND
21:14:10  RENT.
>> Commissioner Yee: I NOTICE YOU HAVE A TWO-WEEK WINDOW OF

21:14:13 OPPORTUNITY APPLY FOR THIS SO IT IS ONLY
21:14:16  WITHIN, I THINK IT
IS MARCH 1 TO
21:14:18  MARCH 15.
OKAY.
ALL RIGHT.

21:14:21 THAT ANSWER BEING MY QUESTION AND I GUESS I LOOKED AT YOUR
DATA AND
21:14:25  I GUESS I'M ONE OF THE 30ADUs THAT
21:14:28  COMPLETED
THEIR PERMIT IN 2021.

21:14:32 SO I GUESS I WAS ONE OF THE 30.
I JUST
21:14:35  THOUGHT THAT WAS INTERESTING TO SEE THAT SLIDE.

21:14:39 >> Chairman Daulton: THANK YOU, COMMISSIONER, FOR YOUR
CONTRIBUTION TO
21:14:43  THE ADUs.
DO WE HAVE ANY FURTHER
21:14:47  CLARIFYING QUESTIONS FROM THE

21:14:50 COMMISSIONERS?
IF NOT, THEN I WOULD LIKE TO INVITE
21:14:53  PUBLIC COMMENT ON THIS
ITEM.

21:14:57 TRISH, DO WE HAVE ANY SPEAKERS ON THIS
21:15:00  ITEM?
>> CHAIR DAULTON, WE HAVE ONE SPEAKSER.

21:15:03 I WILL GO AHEAD AND ALLOW THE SPEAKER TO START
21:15:06  SPEAKING.
JOHN, GO AHEAD AND SPEAK.
>> Chairman Daulton: 
21:15:09 SET THE TIMEER TO TWO MINUTES, IF YOU
WOULD.
>> THANK YOU.

21:15:12 >> THANK YOU.
MY QUICK TWO MINUTES.
JOHN
21:15:16  WEED.
AS THIS WILL BE COME BACK NEXT TIME
21:15:19  AS A FORMER REPORT, I
WANT TO MAKE SOME COMMENTS
21:15:22  NOW SO THEY CAN GET, HAVE SOME
THOUGHT IN
21:15:26  THE PROCESS.
I WOULD ENCOURAGE
21:15:29  TUESDAY GO FOR POLICIES WITH ECONOMIC INT
FREIGHT THE HOUSING
21:15:32  VERSES SEGREGATED HOUSING.
WE FIND THE
21:15:35  PROJECTS ARE BEING BUILT AND YOU BUILT A UNIT
THAT
21:15:38  IS ALL 100% AFFORDABLE OR VERY LOW INCOME,
21:15:42  EXTREMELY
LOW INCOME.
IF YOU CAN INTEGRATE THOSE INTO A
21:15:45  COMMUNITY, YOU WILL HAVE A
MUCH BETTER LONG-TERM RESULT IN
21:15:50  YOUR COMMUNITY
21:15:53 .
IT TRULY IS AN ISSUE OF SEGREGATION.

21:15:58 NEXT, I WOULD ASK YOU TO LOOK AT ALLOWING
21:16:01  LIVE-WORK AREAS IN
THE TOWN CENTER
21:16:04  AREAS.
TOWNSEND BE TER PEDESTRIAN AND LIVE WORK, IT IS PART OF THE

21:16:08 VIBRANCY AND MAINTENANCE OF THE TOWN
21:16:11  CHARACTER AND
COMMUNITY.
I WOULD ENCOURAGE TO YOU
21:16:14  DELETE TCP, TOWNSEND BE TER
PEDESTRIAN
21:16:17  FROM YOUR ZONING ORDINANCE AND MAKE IT ALL TOWN
CENTER
21:16:20  T, WHICH IS TRANSITION.
SOME
21:16:23  CALL IT TOWN CENTER THOROUGHFARE, OR I
21:16:26  HAVE IN THE
PAST.
BUT THAT BE
21:16:31  -- A LIVE/WORK WOULD BE HELPFUL.

21:16:34 NEXT LOOK AT THE ELK'S CLUB, THEY HAVE A NUMBER OF
21:16:39  UNITS
WHERE PEOPLE CAN DRIVE UP THEIR R
21:16:42  Vs, PARK FOR AN EXTENDED
PERIOD OF TIME AND STAY THERE THE
21:16:49  SICS ASKED IF THEY COULD
PUT
21:16:53  THOSE ON THEIR PROPERTY FOR THEIR FAMILIES AND IT WAS

21:16:56 DENIED.
IT WILL BE LOW INCOME HOUSING.
FINELY, ON
21:17:00  ADUs, THE DETERMINATION HAS BEEN MADE THAT
21:17:03  ADUs
ARE EXEMPT FROM OUR
21:17:06  REVIEW EVEN ON HISTORIC
21:17:12  AREAS.
I WOULD ENCOURAGE TO YOU REVISIT THAT DETERMINATION
21:17:15  BECAUSE
IT IS NOT TO ALLOW THE PROJECT BUT MAKE SURE IT
21:17:19  IS
ARCHITECTURALLY COME
21:17:22  PASSIBLE.
THANK YOU.
>> Chairman Daulton: THANK YOU, MR. 
21:17:25 WEED.
IF WE HAVE NO FURTHER PUBLIC
21:17:28  COMMENT, I WILL CLOSE THE
PUBLIC
21:17:35  HEARING.
AND IF, I DON'T KNOW, WOULD THE STAFF LIKE TO
21:17:38  REBUT
MR. WEED'S COMMENT SOME WAY?
IF NOT, I'LL
21:17:41  TAKE QUESTIONS FROM THE
21:17:45  COMMISSIONERS ON THIS
ITEM.

21:17:53 NOTHING?
>> Planner Pullen: IF THE COMMISSIONERS HAD ANY QUESTIONS

21:17:57 RELATED TO PUBLIC COMMENTS, AS USUALLIES, WE WOULD
21:17:59  RESPOND
TO THOSE.
>> Chairman Daulton: OKAY.

21:18:03 SO, I AM INTERESTED IN
21:18:06  MR. WEED'S SUGGESTION OF ELIMINATING
TCP IN FAVOR
21:18:10  OF TOWN CENTER
21:18:13  TRANSITIONAL.
WHAT IS YOUR TAKE ON THAT?
WOULD THAT PROVIDE US
21:18:16  WITH SOME FLEXIBILITY IN
21:18:20  HOUSING
SOLUTIONS?

21:18:24 >> Planner Pullen: NO, IT WOULDN'T.
LET ME EXPLAIN THE DIFFERENT
21:18:28  DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO.
TOWN
21:18:31  CENTER PEDESTRIAN AND TURN TO
21:18:34  CENTER TRANSITIONAL ARE
ZONING DISTRICTS
21:18:38  ASSIGNED WHERE OUR FIVE HISTORIC TOWN

21:18:41 CENTERS, SO NERVE FREMONT PRETTY MUCH KNOWS THOSE,
21:18:45 
IRVINGTON, CENTERVILLE, NILES, WARM
21:18:49  SPRINGS, MISSION,
ET CETERA.
SO WITHIN THOSE AREAS, THE CORE OF
21:18:52  THOSE AREAS ALONG THE

21:18:56 MAIN STREET AND CLOSER TO TRANSIT
21:19:00  SERVICES, THE AREAS WHERE
THERE
21:19:03  IS A MAYBE STREET ENVIRONMENT OR WE WANT TO
21:19:06  EXPEND THE
MAIN STREETTH STREET SIEBEL THAT'S CLOSER TO
21:19:09  THE PEDESTRIAN,

21:19:14 TCP PEDESTRIAN WANTED AREA
21:19:19  HAVE MORE
21:19:23  INTENDS RATIOS,

21:19:26 HIGHER INTENSITY IS
21:19:29  ASSUMED LIVE/WORK IS ALLOWED IN MIXED
USE BUT THERE IS A
21:19:34  DISTINCTION THAT LIVE/WORK CAN'T BE THE
ONLY COMMISSION IN A
21:19:37  MIXESES USE PROJECT SO I THINK THAT
MIGHT BE WHAT THE
21:19:40  SPEAKER WAS REFERRING TO, IF YOU ARE TO
PUT
21:19:43  A NEW BUILDING ON A VERY PRIME LOCATION, WE
21:19:47  WOULD ALLOW
LIVE/WORK BUT IT WOULDN'T BE
21:19:50  THE PRIME RETAIL SPACE.
WE WANT
21:19:53  TO HAVE THAT PEDESTRIAN ACTIVITY
21:19:56  ENCOURAGED.
SO, WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT
21:20:00  TRANSITIONAL, I THINK ABOUT
TRANSITIONAL ABOUT MOSTLY THE
21:20:03  AREAS THAT WERE, A LOT OF THEM
ARE
21:20:06  AREAS THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY DEVELOPED MAYBE IN THE 60s

21:20:10 AND 70s WITH A DIFFERENT TYPE OF DESIGN THAN
21:20:13  WAS, THAN
WHAT WE WANT IN THE VERY CORE OF
21:20:16  THOSE PEDESTRIAN-ORIENTED
TOWN CENTERS
21:20:19  SO THERE WOULDN'T BE A REDUCTION OR INCREASE
21:20:22  IN
HOUSING THAT WOULD COME FROM REZONING
21:20:25  TCP AREAS TO TCT, I
THINK WOULD BE QUITE
21:20:28  THE OPPOSITE.
THOUGH, THE TIME OF USES
21:20:32  IN EACH VARY
21:20:35 .
>> Chairman Daulton: OKAY.
AND DO WE
21:20:39  CONSIDER, FOR EXAMPLE, DOWNTOWN
21:20:43  CENTERVILLE TO BE
TOWN CENTER
21:20:46  PEDESTRIAN?
>> Planner Pullen: YES.
>> Chairman Daulton: AND SO, IS IT 
21:20:49 TYPICAL THAT TOWN CENTER
PEDESTRIAN IN THAT WAY WOULD HAVE LIKE
21:20:53  FIVE--FOOT SIDEWALKS
THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO VAN
21:20:56  TWO LANES IN EACH DIRECTION?
IS THAT --
>> Planner Pullen: 
21:20:59 SO WE'RE NOT TALKING
21:21:02  ABOUT, WE HAVEN'T
SET THIS CONVERSATION UP TO TALK
21:21:06  ABOUT STREETS ALONG
21:21:09  WITH
ANY ONE OF THOSE TYPES OF ZONING OR
21:21:12  GENERAL PLAN WITH
SPECIFIC REGARD TO PROJECT DESIGN BY
21:21:15  THE ZONING.
THERE COMES ALONG WITH THAT A
21:21:18  FEEL FOR THE
21:21:23  BUILDINGS, FORM
BASED ZONING FOR THE BUILDING THERE COMES ALONG
21:21:26  WITH THAT A
STREET STYLE.
THERE ARE A LOT OF
21:21:29  PIECES IN WHAT WE CALL THE PLACE TYPE
MANUAL OF
21:21:32  OUR GENERAL PLAN THAT KIND OF GO ALONG WITH THAT.
IN A TOWN
21:21:36  CENTER, YOU WOULD EXPECT CLASSICALLY YOU WOULD
HAVE WITHIN
21:21:40  NILES THOSE BUILDINGS UP TO THE STREET WITH THE
RHYTHM
21:21:43  OF VERY FREQUENT STORE FRONT OPENINGS AND JEAN
21:21:49  GENEROUS
SIDEWALK AND VERTICAL
21:21:52  FACADE OF THE BUILDING, SIMILARLY
21:21:56  IN
CENTERVILLE WITH
21:21:59  PARRISH AND MAYBE THE TRAIN STATION, YOU
HAVE MORE
21:22:03  INTENSITY OF THAT OLD MAIN STREET STYLE THAT WE
WANT TO
21:22:06  ENCOURAGE TO BE
21:22:11  RETAINED.
IT IS THOSE
21:22:14  AREAS WE WANT THAT TO BE A COMMERCIAL UP TO THE
STREET
21:22:17  AND LIVE/WORK CAN PLAY A
21:22:20  SUPPORTING ROLE.
>> Chairman Daulton: JUST A QUESTION FOR ME, HAVE YOU GUYS

21:22:25 LOOKED AT THE BERKELEY AFFORDABLE
21:22:29  HOUSING ZONING OVERLAY
THEY'RE PUTTING INTO
21:22:32  PLACE THERE AS A POSSIBLE WAY TO

21:22:36 INCENTIVIZE AFFORDABLE
21:22:39  HOUSING CONSTRUCTION?
>> Planner Pullen: I'LL
21:22:42  DEFER TO THE TEAM.
>> SO WHAT I'LL
21:22:46  SAY IS, CHAIR DAULTON, YOU ARE KIND OF AHEAD
OF
21:22:49  YOUR TIME.
THE HOUSINGS ELEMENT UPDATE IS THE
21:22:52  PROCESS WE KIND OF
CONSIDER UPDATES TO MAJOR POLICY CHANGES,
21:22:56  LIKE DEVELOPING AN
AFFORDABLE HOUSING
21:23:00  OVERLAY, SIMILAR OR DIFFERENT THAN
BERKELEYS OR CHANGING
21:23:03  DISTRICTS TO FACILITATE THE
CONSTRUCTION OF MORE HOUSING.

21:23:06 THAT PROCESS IS CURRENTLY YOU WOULD WAY AND WILL BE IN FRONT
OF
21:23:09  PLANNING COMMISSION PRO
21:23:13  PROBABLY IN ABOUT A MONTH.
TONIGHT I DON'T THINK WE'RE
21:23:16  PREPARED OR THE APPROPRIATE
FORMAT FOR A DISCUSSION ON THOSE
21:23:19  TOPICS.
>> Chairman Daulton: THAT'S FINE.
>> IT IS COMING YOUR WAY, BUT
21:23:24  NOT HERE YET.
>> Chairman Daulton: 
21:23:27 AWESOME, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE
21:23:30  COMMISSIONERS?
I WILL ENTERTAIN
21:23:34  A MOTION
21:23:39 .
>> Commissioner Yee: MOTION TO ACCEPT STAFF RECOMMENDATION.

21:23:42 I NEED TO DRINK SOME WATER, I'M GETTING
21:23:44  DRY.
>> Chairman Daulton: DO I HAVE A SECOND ON THAT.

21:23:47 >> I'LL SECOND.
>> Chairman Daulton: I'LL GIVE THAT
21:23:51  TO COMMISSIONER RAO.
>> Commissioner Rao: OKAY, THANK
21:23:54  YOU.
>> Planner Pullen: ALL RIGHT, CHAIR.
SO WITH A MOTION
21:23:58  BY COMMISSIONER YEE AND A SECOND BY

21:24:02 COMMISSIONER RAO TO ACCEPT THE REPORT AND TO SEND IT TO
21:24:05  CITY
COUNCIL, AND THERE AFTER, KEEP IN MIND, THIS IS A REPORT SO

21:24:08 IT IS JUST SORT OF SAYING WHAT WE DID THE LAST YEAR
21:24:11  IN
SUPPORT OF OUR HOUSING ELEMENT GOALS.

21:24:14 THAT WILL BE SENT ON THEN COUNCIL AND TO THE HOUSING
21:24:18  AND
COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT AT THE STATE OF
21:24:21  CALIFORNIA
BY THEIR DEADLINE ON APRIL 1.

21:24:54  YOU, JOEL.
THAT CONCLUDES OUR AGENDA ITEMS FOR THIS EVENING.

21:24:57 WE WILL MORE ON TO MISCELLANEOUS ITEMS.

21:25:00 DO WE HAVE ANY OF
21:25:03  THOSE, JOEL?
>> Planner Pullen: I HAVE ONE UPDATE, THAT IS WITH

21:25:07 COMMISSIONER CARDENAS RESIGNATION FROM THE COUNCIL, UPON HIS
MOVING,
21:25:10  WE DO HAVE AN OPEN VACANCY, AND
21:25:13  I KNOW THE CITY
CLERK IS ACCEPTING
21:25:17  APPLICATIONS.
AND, SO
21:25:20  THAT'S HOPEFULLY WILL BE FILLED SOON AND WE WILL
HAVE ANOTHER
21:25:23  FULL COMMISSION.
BUT WE WILL SEE SO UNTIL THEN, WE'LL
21:25:26  BE OPERATING
21:25:29  ONE SHORT.
>> Chairman Daulton: ALL RIGHT.
ANY ANNOUNCEMENTS FROM THE 
21:25:39 COMMISSIONERS?
NO, NOTHING?
>> Commissioner Steckler: I HAVE
21:25:42  ONE.
>> Chairman Daulton: COMMISSIONER STECKLER, PLEASE.

21:25:45 >> Commissioner Steckler: BECAUSE WE HAVE NEW COMMISSIONERS
I CONTACTED THE
21:25:48  CITY CLERK TO FIND OUT WHEN WE DO THE FORM
700 REPORT TO THE
21:25:51  STATE, WHICH IS OUR
21:25:56  ECONOMIC CONDITION
INDIVIDUALLY AND WHETHER THERE IS
21:25:59  ANY CONFLICTS OF INTEREST.
AND THAT WILL BE COMING OUT
21:26:02  NEXT WEEK AND IT IS DUE
21:26:06  BACK TO
THE CITY CLERK
21:26:10  ON APRIL 1 AND THEN IT GETS FILED WITH THE

21:26:13 STATE.
I WOULD SUGGEST THAT YOU KEEP A
21:26:17  COPY OF THE ACKNOWLEDGMENT
OF
21:26:20  SUBMISSION, BECAUSE LAST YEAR,
21:26:23  I DIDN'T AND IT COST
21:26:26  ME
$100 FINE.
BECAUSE THEY SAID THEY DIDN'T
21:26:30  GET IT.
AND I KNOW I PUT IT
21:26:33  IN.
SO I'M
21:26:36  JUST SAYING
21:26:41  WE ALL HAVE TO DO IT AND BE CONSCIENTIOUS
WHEN
21:26:44  IT COMES OUT.
>> Chairman Daulton: SAGE ADVICE FOR COMMISSIONER STECKLER

21:26:46 THERE.
THANK YOU.
ANY OTHER ANNOUNCEMENTS.

21:26:50 >> Planner Pullen: CHAIR, THAT IS A REALLY GOOD
ANNOUNCEMENT, IF I CAN
21:26:52  QUICKLY SAY.
IT CHANGED FROM THE PAST SO IF YOU DID THIS YEARS AGO, IT

21:26:56 WAS A PAPER FORM AND YOU GOT, THE PERSON WOULD,
21:26:59  YOU KNOW,
PESTER YOU TO TURN THAT IN AND WE
21:27:03  COLLECT THEM AND SEND THEM
IN.
IT IS ALL UP TO YOU NOW
21:27:06  ONLINE.
IT IS MORE PERSONALLY REQUIRED TO BE DONE.

21:27:11 WE HAVE CONNECTED WITH THE NEW COMMISSIONER
21:27:14  ZHANG, I BELIEVE
HE'S ON BOARD WITH THAT PROCESS.
I DO WANT
21:27:17  TO SAY, ALSO, THE OTHER REQUIREMENT FOR

21:27:20 COMMISSIONERS FOR EVERYTHING'S BENEFIT IS PERIODIC
21:27:23  ETHICS
TRAINING THAT IS REQUIRED SO THAT IS SOMETHING
21:27:26  WHAT THAT
WHEN YOU SEE THAT FROM OUR CITY CLERK,
