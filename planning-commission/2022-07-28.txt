19:06:20 LET'S DISCUSS ANY DISCLOSURES THAT THE COMMISSIONERS HAVE
19:06:25  ON AGENDA ITEMS IN FRONT OF US TONIGHT.
19:06:27 
I'D LIKE TO BEGIN WITH COMMISSIONER YEE.

19:06:31 >> Commissioner Yee:   I WENT TO ALL THE SITES AND IN PARTICULAR TO THE
19:06:34  MISSION PARADISE PROJECT.
I MET WITH ONE OF THE APPLICANTS AND THEN SPOKE
19:06:38  WITH SEVERAL BUSINESSES IN THE AREA.
AND THEN FOR THE
19:06:41  CHEVRON CUP PROJECT I WENT TO THE SITE,
19:06:44  SPOKE WITH THE MANAGER THERE AND THEN I ALSO WENT TO THEIR
19:06:48  SISTER SITE, 300 MOWRY AND SPOKE WITH THE
19:06:51  MANAGER THERE AS WELL.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   THANK YOU
19:06:54 .
COMMISSIONER LIU.

19:06:58 CHARLES, YOU'RE ON MUTE.

19:07:04 >> Commissioner Liu:   I VISITED THE BROWN ROAD JOB SITE
19:07:08 .
AS WELL I SPOKE WITH THE APPLICANT.
AND
19:07:11  ALSO VISITED THE
19:07:15  270 WASHINGTON JOB SITE.

19:07:18 THAT'S IT.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   OKAY
19:07:22 .
COMMISSIONER ZHANG.

19:07:28 >> Commissioner Zhang:   I WAS AT THE MISSION PARADISE SITE.
19:07:31 
I TALKED WITH
19:07:35  TWO AND ALSO THE
19:07:38  OWNER.
AND THE BROWN SITE.
THAT'S PRETTY MUCH, YEAH
19:07:41 .
>> Commissioner Daulton:   ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU
19:07:44 .
COMMISSIONER RAO.
>> Commissioner Rao:   HI.

19:07:47 I VISITED MOST OF THESE SITES.
19:07:50 
MISSION PARADISE,
19:07:54  12453, AND ALSO
19:07:57  MET WITH THE
19:08:02  PLAZA, THAT'S IT.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   THANK YOU.
19:08:07 
COMMISSIONER STECKLER.
>> Commissioner Steckler:   I
19:08:10  VISITED ALL SIX SITES, DROVE BY ALL
19:08:13 .
>> Commissioner Daulton:   AND COMMISSIONER BASRAI
19:08:17 .
>> Commissioner Basrai:   I VISITED THE MISSION PARADISE SITE
19:08:20 , SPOKE TO A LOCAL BUSINESS OWNER.
I VISITED
19:08:24  THE TRIPLE E SITE AND THE CHEVRON
19:08:26  SITE JUST VISITED.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU.

19:08:29 AND I WALKED EACH OF THE SITES ON OUR LIST TONIGHT
19:08:32 .

19:08:36 SO IT APPEARS THAT WE HAVE NO ITEMS ON CONSENT
19:08:39  CALENDAR TONIGHT.
SO I'D LIKE TO GO STRAIGHT
19:08:42  TO --
>> Commissioner Yee:   OH
19:08:46 , COMMISSIONER
19:08:50  DAULTON.
I WOULD LIKE TO RECOMMEND WE
19:08:53  COULD TAKE TWO OF THE ITEMS AND PUT THEM INTO THE
19:08:59  CONSENT ITEMS.
I'D LIKE THE ANNUAL
19:09:02  REVIEW AND THE PARK
19:09:07  57 INTO THE CALENDAR
19:09:10 .
>> Planner Pullen:   I'LL BEAT TO YOU THE PUNCH
19:09:13 .
WE ARE NOT ABLE TO PUT THOSE
19:09:17  ON CONSENT CALENDAR, BECAUSE THEY ARE
19:09:21  PUBLIC HEARING ITEMS.
EVEN THOUGH THERE IS NO ONE HERE TO
19:09:24  SPEAK TO THOSE ITEMS WE NEED OPUT THEM INTO
19:09:27  THE AGENDA.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   I HEAR YOU LOUD AND CLEAR.

19:09:30 IN THAT CASE, LET'S MOVE INTO
19:09:34  THE PUBLIC COMMUNICATIONS PART OF THE MEETING.
IF YOU WOULD
19:09:37  LIKE TO SPEAK TO ANYTHING THAT IS NOT ON THE
19:09:40  AGENDA, PLEASE VIRTUALLY RAISE YOUR HAND AND
19:09:43  EVERYONE GETS TWO MINUTES TONIGHT.
TRISH DO WE HAVE ANY
19:09:46  SPEAKERS?
>> CHAIR DAULTON, WE
19:09:49  HAVE A SPEAKER, ACTUALLY I SEE TWO SPEAKERS BUT
19:09:52  I'LL START WITH THE FIRST.
KELLY A YOU NOW
19:09:56  HAVE PERMISSION TO SPEAK.
GO AHEAD.

19:10:01 >> THANK YOU.
FIRST OFF, THE HOUSING ELEMENT THAT SOME
19:10:04  OF YOU MIGHT BE FAMILIAR WITH, IF YOU WOULD KIND OF TAKE
19:10:07  A CLOSE LOOK AT THAT.
MISSION SAN JOSE IS SORT OF ABSENT
19:10:10  FROM THAT.
THERE IS A LONG STRIP OF
19:10:13  PROPOSED HIGH DENSITY HOUSING DEVELOPMENT ALL
19:10:16  ALONG FREMONT BOULEVARD AND DOWNTOWN.
19:10:19 
BUT MISSION SAN JOSE, THE TOWN CENTER FROM MISSION SAN JOSE IS OVER
19:10:23 LOOKED OR OMITTED AND THAT IS GOING TO CAUSE THE -- THAT
19:10:26  IS CAUSING THE DEGRADATION,
19:10:31  THE COLLAPSE OF THE COMMERCIAL CENTER
19:10:34  OF MISSION
SAN JOSE.
THOSE OF YOU WHO WALKED AND BIKED
19:10:37  AND TALKED ALL AROUND THAT NEIGHBORHOOD, YOU MIGHT
19:10:41  HAVE NOTICED THERE IS A THING CALLED MISSION BURGER,
19:10:44  IT'S CLOSED, SIGNS ALL OVER SAYING
19:10:47  THEY'RE COMING BACK BUT
IT'S DEAD.
19:10:51 
THERE ARE DON'T CONFORM TO THE CURRENT LAWS AND IF
19:10:54  SOMEONE TRIED TO BUILD NEW ONES THEY WOULD BE ILLEGAL.
IT IS ONE
19:10:58  OF THE VIABLE COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS THERE.
19:11:01 
THE BANK OF AMERICA IT'S A NICE BUILDING
19:11:04  BUT IT'S OF IT'S DEAD, IT'S CLOSED, LOCKED.
19:11:08 
THE STARBUCKS, IT IS CLOSED.
THE SEARCH 11
19:11:11  IT CLOSED, THE McGIVE
19:11:14 R HARDWARE IS CLOSED.
THESE THINGS
19:11:17  ARE CLOSING NOT BECAUSE OF COMMERCIAL INTEREST ON THE PART OF
19:11:20  POLITICIANS AND THE PLANNERS, NO.
WHAT'S KILLING THEM IS A LACK
19:11:24  OF HOUSING DEVELOPMENT.
THIS PLACE IS UNDERDEVELOPED WITH A
19:11:28  HUGE HOUSING DEMAND AND THERE'S VERY LITTLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT
19:11:31  GOING ON.
SO I'D LIKE FOR ALL OF THE PEOPLE
19:11:34  IN FREMONT ESPECIALLY THE PLANNERS AND THE POLITICIANS
19:11:37 , AND THE MEMBERS OF THE PLANNING COMMISSION, EVERYONE
19:11:40  WHO HAS MADE SURE THAT HOUSING DEVELOPMENT DOESN'T HAPPEN
19:11:44 
IN MISSION SAN JOSE, YOU SHOULD TAKE CREDIT FOR
19:11:47  KILLING MISSION SAN JOSE.
AND EVERYONE SHOULD TAKE
19:11:50  A DEEP BOW AND WHEN WE RETURN IT TO THE FARM
19:11:53  FIELDS THAT IT ONCE WAS, YOU
19:11:57  WILL HAVE FULL CREDIT FOR THAT,
19:11:59  THANKS.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU MR. KELLY.

19:12:03 MAY I HAVE THE NEXT SPEAKER PLEASE?
>> YES
19:12:06 , CHAIR DAULTON WE HAVE ANOTHER SPEAKER.
THE NEXT
19:12:09  SPEAKER IS ANNIE.
GO AHEAD AND SPEAK.

19:12:14 >> YES, I'M ANNIE FOR FREMONT FOR EVERYONE AND
19:12:17  BECAUSE YOU HEARD ME LESS THAN 30 MINUTES AGO I
19:12:20  DON'T FEEL THE NEED TO FULLY REINTRODUCE MYSELF AGAIN
19:12:23 .
I'M HERE TO SPEAK A LITTLE BIT MORE ON THE DRAFT
19:12:26  HOUSING ELEMENT BECAUSE FREMONT FOR EVERYONE
19:12:29 'S ANALYSIS LIKE I SPOKE EARLIER QUITE FRANKLY
19:12:32  HAS SO MANY GREAT ITEMS THAT
19:12:35  I'M EXCITED ABOUT I RAN OUT OF
TIME THE LAST TIME.
I
19:12:39  WANT TO RUN OVER POLICY SUGGESTIONS WE HAVE IN OUR
19:12:42  PRELIMINARY REVIEW.
FIRST OUR REVIEW SUGGESTS THAT COMMITTING TO
19:12:45  THE FREMONT SPECIFIC POINT IN
19:12:48  TIME COUNT DATA IS RELEASED THAT WE COULD
19:12:52  ADOPT POLICIES THAT COULD MITIGATE THE CAUSES
19:12:55  OF  HOMELESSNESS IN FREMONT AS
SHOWN IN
19:12:59  THE SURVEY.
HOMELESSNESS
19:13:02  IS PRIMARILY AN ECONOMIC
19:13:06  PROBLEM SO SOLUTIONS ARE GOING TO BE REQUIRED LIKE
19:13:09  OTHER TYPES OF SOLUTIONS LIKE MENTAL HEALTH CARE AND
19:13:12  DRUG ADDICTION CARE.
THE SECOND THING I WOULD LIKE TO SUGGEST
19:13:16  IS DOING AN URBAN 3 ANALYSIS OF FREMONT TO LEARN
19:13:19  WHICH TYPES OF DEVELOPMENT ARE FISCALLY SUSTAINABLE LONG TERM
19:13:22 .
URBAN 3 IS AN ORGANIZATION WHICH AMONG OTHER THINGS
19:13:25  ANALYZES CITY REVENUE PER PARCEL TO LEARN WHICH AREAS
19:13:28  HAVE THE DENSEST AND MOST SUSTAINABLE TAX BASES
19:13:32  AND WHICH AREAS DON'T GENERATE ENOUGH
19:13:35  TAX
REVENUE TO SUSTAIN THEMSELVES AND ARE
19:13:39  EFFECTIVELY SUBSIDIZED.
AND THE LAST THING THAT I'D LIKE TO
19:13:42  SUGGEST IS THAT AS PART OF THE PERMITTING PROCESS, WE
19:13:45  REQUIRE AN ANALYSIS OF WHETHER A DEVELOPMENT INCREASE
19:13:48 S OR DECREASES CAR
19:13:52  DEPENDENCY AND IF IT WOULD INCREASE
CAR DEPENDENCY BY
19:13:54  A SIGNIFICANT FACTOR REQUIRING CHANGES TO PREVENT THAT INCREASED
19:13:58  CAR DEPENDENCY AND INSTEAD WORKING TOWARDS
19:14:01  MIXED USE SPACES OR A WALKABLE AND BIKEABLE SPACE
19:14:04 S THAT ARE VIBRANT FOR
EVERYONE AND GOOD FOR
19:14:07  SMALL BUSINESSES.
THANK YOU.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   THANK YOU
19:14:10  ONCE AGAIN ANNIE.
TRADITION
19:14:13 TRISH IS THAT OUR LAST SPEAKER?
>> WE
19:14:17  HAVE ONE LAST SPEAKER, DAVID BONACCORSI,
19:14:20  GO AHEAD AND SPEAK, PLEASE.

19:14:25 A.
>> GOOD EVENING.
MY NAME IS DAVID BONACCORSI,
19:14:28  THANK YOU, CHAIR DAULTON AND MEMBERS OF THE PLANNING COMMISSION.
I
19:14:31  AM ALSO PART OF THE FREMONT FOR EVERYONE,
19:14:34  I UNFORTUNATELY WAS NOT ABLE TO ATTEND STUDY SESSION.
HOWEVER
19:14:37  I WANT TO COMMEND STAFF AND THE PLANNING COMMISSION FOR REALLY DRILLING
19:14:41  DOWN ON THE ASPECTS OF THE HOUSING ELEMENT.
THIS IS SO
19:14:44  CRITICAL.
I SERVED ON THE PLANNING COMMISSION FROM
19:14:48  2007 UNTIL 2017, AND BECAUSE
19:14:51  OF MY SERVICE THEN, ON THE PLANNING COMMISSION, I'VE GONE
19:14:54  THROUGH ABOUT THREE OR FOUR RHNA
19:14:59  CYCLES AND REALLY MY MAJOR CONCERN AND
MAY
19:15:32  HAVE BEEN STRESSED BY OTHERS WHO HAVE ALREADY
19:15:33  ASSUMPTIONS IN TERMS OF PROJECTING FORWARD.
AND I AGAIN WANT
19:15:36  TO COMMEND STAFF FOR HAVING MORE OUTREACH THAN I EVER
19:15:40  REMEMBER WHEN I WAS ON THE COMMISSION.
AND FOR
19:15:43  THE STUDY SESSION TONIGHT AS WELL AS THE MEETING NEXT WEDNESDAY, WE'LL HAVE
19:15:46  A MORE OR LESS FORMAL
19:15:49  OPPORTUNITY OF HAVING AN EXCHANGE OF IDEAS.
BUT PLEASE TAKE
19:15:52  NOTE OF THE COMMENTS THAT WE SUBMITTED EARLIER TODAY THAT'S A
19:15:55  COLLECTIVE EFFORT, AND WE REALLY WANT TO SEE
19:16:00  THE HOUSING ELEMENT CERTIFIED BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, WE
19:16:02  WANT TO SEE FREMONT
MEET
19:16:06  ITS DESPERATE NEED FOR PROVIDING HOUSING FOR THE UNDER
19:16:09 HOUSED AND UNHOUSED.
SO GOOD WORK, CONTINUE ON AND
19:16:12  I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING
19:16:16  THIS DIALOGUE.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   THANK YOU MR. BONACCORSI
19:16:18 .
TRISH, IS THAT OUR LAST
19:16:21  SPEAKER?
>> ACTUALLY I HAVE ANOTHER SPEAKER.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   ALL
19:16:24  RIGHT.
>> I'LL INTRODUCE THAT SPEAKER.
CHRISTINE YOU ARE NOW
19:16:27  -- HAVE PERMISSION TO SPEAK.
GO AHEAD
19:16:31 .
19:16:44 
>> CAN YOU HEAR ME?
>> YES, WE CAN HEAR
19:16:46  YOU.
GO AHEAD.
>> OKAY GREAT.

19:16:49 MY NAME IS CHRISTINE MUSCLEMAN AND
19:16:53  I'M A LONG TERM RESIDENT OF FREMONT.
I'M ALSO
19:16:57  A MEMBER OF FREMONT FOR EVERYONE.
19:17:01 
I READ THE
19:17:03  HOUSING ELEMENT.
MAINLY I
19:17:06  FOCUS ON THE AFFIRMATIVE
19:17:12  FURTHER FAIR IN HOUSING SECTION, WHAT I
19:17:15  SEEN MAINLY IN HERE IS WHILE THE STAFF DID THE GREAT JOB
19:17:18  IN COMING UP WITH THE HOUSING
19:17:22  ELEMENT, I DON'T SEE IT SIMPLY
19:17:25  HAVING
ENOUGH ACTION PLANS THAT MEET THE NEED
19:17:29  FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEMAND IN TREATMENT
19:17:32 .
AND ALSO, ENOUGH
19:17:38  ACTION TO MAKE AVAILABLE EVERY NOW AND THEN SPECIFICALLY FOR
19:17:41  VERY LOW INCOME RESIDENTS.

19:17:45 WE ALL KNOW THE ISSUES WE'RE HAVING WITH THE UNHOUSED
19:17:49  NEIGHBORS IN FREMONT AND THOSE FALL IN THE NO INCOME
19:17:52  OR VERY, VERY LOW INCOME CATEGORY.
19:17:56 
AND TO BE REALLY AFFORDABLE AND
19:17:59  AVAILABLE FOR FREMONT TO BE AVAILABLE
19:18:04  FOR -- AND FAIR TO ALL
19:18:07  THE RESIDENTS OF ALL TYPE, WE NEED TO ATTEND TO
19:18:12  THAT SECTOR OF THE RESIDENTS
19:18:16  THAT ARE  UNDERSERVED
CURRENTLY
19:18:19 .
GIVEN PRICES OF RENTS AROUND
19:18:23 , EVEN THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING
19:18:27  ASPECT WHERE REDUCED RENTS IS NOT GOING TO COME
19:18:30  CLEAR, CLOSE TO MEETING THE
19:18:33  INCOME LEVEL OF THESE VERY, VERY
19:18:36  LOW INCOME FOLKS.
SO I
19:18:39  APPRECIATE THE EFFORT BUT I THINK WE NEED TO BE
19:18:42  A LITTLE BIT MORE AGGRESSIVE IF
19:18:46  WE WANT TO SEE SOLUTIONS FOR OUR UNHOUSED
19:18:49  NEIGHBORS.
THANK YOU.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   THANK YOU
19:18:52 .
TRISH, DO WE HAVE ANY MORE SPEAKERS?
>> 
19:18:56 WE DO NOT HAVE ANY MORE SPEAKERS.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU.
19:19:00 
SO AT THIS TIME I'D LIKE TO OPEN THE PUBLIC HEARING AND MOVE ON TO
19:19:02  OUR REGULAR AGENDA ITEMS.
WE HAVE SIX AGENDA ITEMS
19:19:05  THIS EVENING.
JOEL IF YOU WOULD, PLEASE READ
19:19:09  THE FIRST ITEM
19:19:12 'S TITLE.

19:19:21 >> Planner Pullen:   HERE WE GO, BUTTON WAS NOT

ALSO TO CONSIDER A FINDING NO FURTHER
19:20:05  ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW IS REQUIRED, PURSUANT TO CEQA
19:20:08  UNDER GUIDELINES FOR INFILL DEVELOPMENT AND ALSO
19:20:11  BECAUSE IT'S CONSISTENT WITH THE GENERAL PLAN FOR AREA IN

SO THE PROJECT PLANNER

19:21:11 >> GOOD EVENING, CHAIR DAULTON AND MEMBERS OF THE PLANNING COMMISSION.
I DO HAVE
19:21:14  A POWERPOINT, LET
19:21:39  ME PULL THAT UP.

19:21:41  DISCRETIONARY DESIGN PERM, VEST
19:21:45  VESTING TENTATIVE TRACT MAP AND STREETS
19:21:49 .
SURPLUS I RIGHT-OF-WAY ALONG
19:21:52  THE SITE'S WASHINGTON BOULEVARD
19:21:55  FRONTAGE.
THE COMMISSION
19:21:58  IS OTHERWISE NOT SUBJECT TO
19:22:02  FURTHER ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW BECAUSE THE PROJECT IS CONSISTENT WITH THE GENERAL  PLAN.

19:22:07 THE PROJECT SITE IS LOCATED AT THE SOUTHWEST CORNER OF
19:22:11  WASHINGTON BOULEVARD AND ELLSWORTH STREET.
AFTER THE
19:22:14  PROPOSED STREET VACATION IT WOULD MEASURE NEARLY 29,000
19:22:17  SQUARE FEET OR ABOUT TWO-THIRDS OF AN ACRE.
IT CARRIES
19:22:21  A GENERAL PLAN
19:22:25  DESIGNATION OF COMMERCIAL TOWN CENTER
19:22:28 , MIXED USE ZONE THAT IMPLEMENTS
19:22:31  THE MAIN STREET VISION OF THE COMMERCIAL TOWN CENTER
19:22:35  DESIGNATION.
THE SITE
19:22:38  IS LOCATED WITHIN THE COURT AREA OF THE MISSION SAN JOSE HISTORIC OVER
19:22:42 LAY DISTRICT AND ALSO LOCATED WITHIN THE HIM SIDE
19:22:45  COMBINING DISTRICT.
DATING BACK TO 1953 THE SITE WAS HOME
19:22:48  TO TWO SINGLE STORY COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS.

19:22:51 SEVERAL YEARS AGO THOSE BUILDINGS WERE VACATED AND THE SITE
19:22:55  SUBSEQUENTLY BECAME A SITE OF BLIGHT
19:22:58  AND, ACTIVITY.
AN EMERGENCY AUTHORIZATION
19:23:02 , WAS GRANTED AND IN APRIL OF THIS YEAR THE TWO STRUCTURES
19:23:05  WERE TAKEN DOWN.
THE SITE
19:23:10  IS BORDERED BY A TWO
19:23:12  STORY DUPLEX TO THE WEST,
19:23:15  A BUILDING TO THE SOUTHWEST AND A TWO STORY RESIDENCE TO THE SOUTH
19:23:18  SOUTH.
NONE OF THE STRUCTURES ON THIS SITE IS
19:23:22  FOUND TO COVER HISTORIC
19:23:26  SIGNIFICANCE, GENERAL DESIGNATION AS THE PROJECT SITE
19:23:28 .
THE FIVE BUILDING PROJECT
19:23:31  IS MIXED USE IN NATURE, WITH 13 DWELLING UNITS
19:23:34  AND APPROXIMATELY 3050
19:23:37  SQUARE FEET OF COMMERCIAL AREA.
THE PROJECT'S COMMERCIAL
19:23:40  COMPONENT WOULD BE LOCATED WITHIN A TWO STORY BUILDING AT THE
19:23:44  CORNER OF WASHINGTON AND ELLSWORTH.
ABOVE THE COMMERCIAL
19:23:47  SPACE WOULD BE A RESIDENTIAL LEVEL THAT CONTAINS TWO FLATS.
THE
19:23:50  OTHER FOUR PROJECT BUILDINGS WOULD CONTAIN REAR LOAD
19:23:53 ED TOWN HOUSE SOMETIME UNITS THAT STAND THREE STORIES
19:23:56  IN HEIGHT.
TWO OF THE RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS WOULD BE BUILT ALONG
19:23:59  THE SITE STREET FRONTAGES WITH
19:24:02  MINIMAL SETBACKS AS REQUIRED AND FEATURE UNITS WITH STREET FACE
19:24:06 ING ENTRIES AND PATIOS THAT CREATE A
19:24:09  PEDESTRIAN
ORIENTED INTERFACE
19:24:13  IN ACCORDANCE WITH ZONING STANDARDS AND TOWN CENTER OBJECTIVES
19:24:16 .
WHO OTHER BUILDINGS WOULD BE LOCATED WHIND
19:24:19  THE SITE'S INTERIOR.
THE PROJECT WOULD
19:24:22  BE ACCESSED WITHIN A SINGLE CURB CUT ALONG
19:24:26  WASHINGTON BOULEVARD THAT LEADS TO
19:24:32  INTERNAL STREETS.
PROJECT DEVELOPMENT WOULD
19:24:35  INCLUDE SIGNIFICANT RIGHT-OF-WAY ENHANCEMENTS INCLUDING EXPANDED
19:24:40  ADA SIDEWALKS AND PROJECTS WITH STREET TREES, IN ADDITION
19:24:44  TO NINE PARKING STALLS THAT WOULD BE COUNTED
TOWARDS
19:24:47  THE COMMERCIAL COMPONENT'S PARKING REQUIREMENT.
FOR THE
19:24:50  MUNICIPAL CODE.
MIXED USE ARE ALLOWED
19:24:55  TO TOWARDS SATISFYING THE PROJECT'S
19:24:57  COMER COMMERCIAL REQUIREMENT.
SUCH PARKING IS A
19:25:00  BY RIGHT ALLOWANCE NOT SUBJECT TO ANY
19:25:03  OTHER DISCRETIONARY TYPE OF
19:25:07  OFFENSE.
AN APPLICABLE DESIGN STANDARDS.

19:25:12 THE SITE'S TOWN CENTER PEDESTRIAN ZONING ALLOWS FOR
19:25:15  RESIDENTIAL USES ONLY IN CONJUNCTION WITH A MIXED USE
19:25:19  PROJECT.
SPECIFICALLY STANDARDS ARE SET IN THE ZONING CODE
19:25:23  TO ESTABLISH A SUBSTANTIAL COMMERCIAL COMPONENT FOR SUCH PROJECTS
19:25:25 .
THIS PROPOSAL INCLUDES A COMMERCIAL COMPONENT THAT
19:25:28  SIZED AND DEMAND TO MEET THE MIX
19:25:31 ED USE COMMERCIAL REQUIREMENTS INCLUDING DEPTH OF AT
19:25:35  LEAST 50 FEET AND MIXED FLOOR
19:25:39  TO CEILING HEIGHT.
ADDITIONALLY, THE PROJECT'S
19:25:42  COMMERCIAL COMPONENT WOULD BE DEVELOPED ALONG THE SIDEWALK EDGE AND
19:25:46  FEATURE LARGE WINDOW OPENINGS TO ENHANCE THE
19:25:52  PUBLIC REALLY.

19:26:10  REALM.
ON THE
19:26:14 .
THE BOTTOM SLIDE IS A VIEW FROM ELLSWORTH
19:26:16  STREET.
THE RIGHT SIDE IS A
19:26:20  MIXED USE BUILDING AND THE LEFT IS A THREE
19:26:23  UNIT BUILDING.
CONNECT
19:26:27 ING IS THERE AN INTERN PASSAGE WAY
19:26:30  FROM THE MIXED USE BUILDING.
COURTYARDS ARE ENCOURAGED
19:26:33  IN MISSION SAN JOSE ESPECIALLY COURTYARDS THAT ARE SITUATED
19:26:36  BETWEEN BUILDINGS AND THIS ONE WOULD BE PUBLICLY ACCESSIBLE
19:26:40  DURING DAYTIME HOURS AND FEATURE A VARIETY OF
19:26:43 
AMENITIES TO CREATE AN INVITING SPACE.

19:26:46 HERE ARE THE INTERIOR NONSTREET ELEVATIONS.
THE
19:26:49  TOP IMAGE SHOWS A VIEW FROM THE WEST AND THE BOTTOM
19:26:52  IMAGE SHOWS THE VIEW FROM THE SOUTH.
THESE MORE UNDERSTATE
19:26:55 ED  ELEVATIONS FEATURE FEWER AND SMALLER
19:26:58  WINDOW OPENINGS TO MAXIMIZE PRIVACY BETWEEN THE SITE
19:27:01  AND ADJACENT DEVELOPMENTS.
PRIVACY WOULD BE FURTHER ENHANCE
19:27:04  ENHANCED BY SCRIEN TREES THAT ARE PROPOSED TO BE PLANT
19:27:07 ED AMONG THE
19:27:11  SITE'S INTERIOR.

19:27:14 THE PROJECT ARCHITECT HAS CHOSEN TO DESIGN THE PROJECT IN
19:27:17  THE MISSION REVIVAL STYLE WHICH IS IDENTIFIED
19:27:20  IN THE MISSION SAN JOSE DESIGN GUIDELINES AS MORE OF THE PREVALENT
19:27:24  ARCHITECTURAL STYLES IN THE
DISTRICT.
PROJECT BUILDINGS HAVE BEEN DESIGNED
19:27:28  TO REFLECT THE  PROJECT'S
19:27:31  SIMPLE
19:27:35  RECTILINEAR FORMS.
BETTER FIT WITHIN
19:27:39  THE CONTEXT OF THE DISTRICT.
PROJECT BUILDINGS HAVE BEEN DESIGNED
19:27:42  WITH WOOD FRAMING FINISHED WITH LARGE FLAT
19:27:45  WHITE STUCCO WALLS THAT FEATURE MINIMAL ADORNMENT
19:27:48 .
BUILDINGS CONTAIN LOW GARNL
19:27:53  ANGLED
19:27:56  EAVES, AND THE COMMERCIAL SPACE ARE
19:27:59  FRAMED BY ARCHED ENTRIES AND ARCHED ELEMENTS ARE
19:28:02  INCORPORATED IN OTHER ELEMENTS OF THE PROJECT.
THE
19:28:05  COMMERCIAL FRONTAGE FEATURES LARGE WOOD
19:28:08  FRAMED WINDOWS AND WOOD ENTRY DOORS AND THE USE OF WOOD
19:28:11  IS CARRIED THROUGHOUT THE PROJECT.
HERE IS THE
19:28:14  PROJECT'S MATERIALS BOARD.
WHICH FURTHER DETAILS THE ELEVATIONS
19:28:17 .
COLORS AND MATERIALS ARE IN KEEPING WITH THE
19:28:21  MISSION REVIVAL STYLE INCLUDING LIGHT BASE COLORS
19:28:24  WITH DARKER TRIMS AND THE BUILDING'S
19:28:27  STUCCO FACADE
19:28:30 S COMPLEMENTED BY A VARIETY OF WOOD DETAILS
19:28:33  INCLUDING
DOORS WINDOWS, PAVILIONINGS AND
19:28:36  CORE
19:28:39  AND CORE
19:28:42  AND  COACIALS.

19:28:48 WASHINGTON BOULEVARD FRONTAGE FOR INCORPORATION INTO THE PROJECT.
19:28:54 
THE RIGHT-OF-WAY VACATION WOULD BRING THE CURB LINE OR THE
19:28:57  BLOCKS EAST AND WEST OF THE SITES.
THE RED LINE OF THIS
19:29:00  IMAGE IDENTIFIES THE CURB LINE ON THOSE TWO
19:29:04  ADJOINING BLOCKS.
THE AREA THAT WOULD BE VACATED IS
19:29:07  NOT CURRENTLY USED OR DESIGNED FOR VEHICLE PARKING
19:29:10  OR TRAVEL AND IS VIEWED FOR REMNANT LAND
19:29:13  SUITABLE FOR ASSEMBLAGE INTO THE PROJECT SITE
19:29:18 .
EXPANDED ACCESSIBLE SIDEWALK AND A SIZABLE
19:29:21  PARKWAY THAT WOULD IMPROVE FED WALKABILITY
19:29:27  AND COMFORT AND WOULD FACILITATE CREATION OF A RAISED BULB
19:29:30 
INTERSECTION REDUCING THE CROSSING DISTANCE AT ELLSWORTH STREET
19:29:34  AND THEREBY INCREASING PLAIFORT
19:29:37  INCREASING PUBLIC SAFETY.
AS A NEW
19:29:40  DEVELOPMENT WITHIN THE COURTYARD AREA OF THE
19:29:44  MISSION SAN JOSE HISTORIC DISTRICT HARBOR VIEW WAS
19:29:47  REQUIRED.
VOTED
19:29:50  2-2 TO RECOMMEND THAT THE PLANNING COMMISSION APPROVE
19:29:53  THE VOTE.
THE PROJECT VIEW WAS
19:29:56  WITH THE MISSION SAN JOSE DESIGN GUIDELINES.
THE TIE VOTE EQUATES TO
19:29:59  A FAILURE TO RECOMMEND PROJECT APPROVAL.
THOSE
19:30:03  WHO VOTED GENETICS THE PROJECT CITED THE SIZE MUCH
19:30:06  PROJECT BUILDINGS AND ARCHITECTURAL IN
19:30:09 COMPATIBILITY WITH THE EXISTING CHARACTER OF THE DISTRICT.

19:30:16 AS INCLUDED IN YOUR
19:30:22  PACKETS THIS EVENING, A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF
19:30:23  PUBLIC CORRESPONDENCE HAS BEEN RECEIVED.
MUCH HAS
19:30:27 ED AGAINST TREMG PROJECT.
FOR REASONS THAT ARE DESCRIBED IN
19:30:28  THIS PRESENTATION AND  EXPANDED UPON IN THE STAFF REPORT, STAFF RECOMMENDS
19:30:32  THAT THE PLANNING COMMISSION APPROVE THIS DISCRETIONARY DESIGN
19:30:35  REVIEW PERMIT, VESTING
TENTATIVE TRACT
19:30:38  MAP, PRIVATE STREET AND TREE REMOVAL REQUEST
19:30:41 , FIND THE VACATION IN
19:30:44  CONFORMANCE WITH THE GENERAL PLAN AND FIND THAT
19:30:47  THE PROJECT IS EXEMPT
19:30:50  OF THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT, IN
19:30:54 
ACCORDANCE TO 17 THREE 32, AND THAT
19:30:57  NO FURTHER ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW IS REQUIRED PURSUANT TO
19:31:00  CEQA SECTION 15183 AS THE
19:31:03  PROJECT IS CONSISTENT WITH THE DENSITY ESTABLISHED IN THE GENERAL PLAN.
THAT
19:31:07  CONCLUDES STAFF'S PRESENTATION.
I'LL BE AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY
19:31:10  QUESTIONS AND AS JOEL MENTIONED THE APPLICANT DOES HAVE A PRESENTATION
19:31:14  OF THEIR OWN.
THANK YOU.

19:31:18 >> Commissioner Daulton:   OKAY SO THANK YOU MARK.

19:31:22 CLARIFYING QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME FROM STAFF?
JOEL
19:31:25 ?
>> Planner Pullen:   YES, BEFORE WE GO ON CHAIR, SORRY I WAS
19:31:28  REMISS IN NOT MENTIONING THERE IS A NOTES AND CORRECTION
19:31:31  SHEET ON THIS ITEM.
AND SPECIFICALLY
19:31:34 , THERE WERE -- THE MINUTES FOR
19:31:38  THE HARB MEETING WERE IN DRAFT BECAUSE THEY HAD NOT HAD
19:31:41  ANOTHER MEETING TO ACCEPT THOSE.
SO WE GOT SOME FEEDBACK
19:31:44  FROM ONE OF THE HARB MEMBERS WITH SOME CLARIFICATIONS
19:31:47  ON THEIR CONTRIBUTION TO THE MINUTES.
JUST TO BE CLEAR THERE WAS
19:31:50  NO STAFF RECOMMENDATION OR THERE WAS NO HARB RECOMMENDATION
19:31:53 , THEY FAILED TO TAKE ACTION AND THE FAILURE TO TAKE ACTION
19:31:57  IS WHAT WE TRANSMIT
19:32:00  WITH THEIR DESCRIPTION TO YOU FOR
YOUR CONSIDERATION
19:32:03 .
>> Commissioner Daulton:   THANK YOU.
SO AT THIS TIME I'D LIKE
19:32:07  TO GET CLARIFYING QUESTIONS
19:32:10  FROM THE COMMISSION.
IF WE HAVE ANY
19:32:13 .
FOR STAFF.

19:32:16 THANK YOU, COMMISSIONER YEE.

19:32:21 >> Commissioner Yee:   YES.
19:32:25 
AS WE KNOW, THERE IS A BIKE LANE THAT GOES RIGHT THROUGH THERE
19:32:28 .
WILL THAT BE AFFECTED IN ANY WAY INCLUDING THOSE BOLLARD
19:32:32 S THAT ARE THERE?
>> THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION.
NO, THE
19:32:37  BIKE LANE WOULD NOT BE AFFECTED.
SO CURRENTLY THE WASHINGTON
19:32:38  BOULEVARD ROADWAY IS
19:32:41  STRIPED TO MEET AN APPROVED
19:32:45  WASHINGTON BOULEVARD STREET SECTS AND THAT INCLUDES SINGLE TRAVEL LANES
19:32:48  IN EAST AND WEST DIRECTIONS WITH A SHARED LEFT TURN
19:32:51 
LANE IN THE CENTER AND BIKE LANES BUFFERING THE
19:32:55  TWO TRAFFIC LANES.
THE EXISTING STRIPING WOULD NOT
19:32:58  HAVE TO BE -- WOULD NOT BE IMPACTED BY
19:33:01  THE PROPOSED STREET VACATION OR THE STREET IMPROVEMENTS.

19:33:05 >> Commissioner Yee:   OKAY, THANK YOU.

19:33:07 >> Commissioner Daulton:   YES, CARE RECOGNIZES COMMISSIONER STECKLER
19:33:11 .
>> Commissioner Steckler:   YES.
FOLLOWING THAT RED LINE THAT
19:33:14  WAS ON THE DIAGRAM ON WASHINGTON BOULEVARD,
19:33:17  IS THE APPLICANT PUTTING IN NEW
19:33:20  SIDEWALKS ALL THE WAY UP TO
19:33:25  MISSION BOULEVARD ON WASHINGTON?
>> THEY WOULD NOT
19:33:29 .
SO THE SCOPE OF THE IMPROVEMENTS WOULD BE JUST ALONG
19:33:32  THE WASHINGTON
19:33:36  BOULEVARD FRONTAGE OF THE PROJECT SITE WITH A PORTION
19:33:39  OF THE ELLSWORTH FRONTAGE AS WELL IN ORDER TO CREATE
19:33:42  THE HARD
SCAPE IMPROVEMENTS FOR BULBOUT
19:33:46  THAT WOULD ESSENTIALLY REMOVE THE
19:33:52  EXISTING DELINEATORS THAT WOULD CREATE THAT FACE FOR REDUCED
19:33:53  SIDEWALK CROSSING.
THIS PROJECT WOULD JUST MAKE
19:33:56  THAT INTO HARD SCAPE AND MORE FORMALIZE IT
19:34:00 .
BUT THE IMPROVEMENTS WOULD NOT EXTEND BEYOND THE
19:34:01  PROJECT SITE.
>> Commissioner Steckler:   THANK YOU.

19:34:04 MY SECOND QUESTION IS, THE COMMON AREA BETWEEN THE
19:34:07  TWO BUILDINGS, IF YOU ARE LOOKING AT IT FROM
19:34:11  ELLSWORTH, IS THAT ADA
19:34:14  ACCESSIBLE?
>> THE COMMON AREA WOULD BE ADA
19:34:17  ACCESSIBLE.
19:34:20 
THE THEY WOULD NOT BE -- SOMEONE WITH
19:34:23  A DISABILITY WOULD NOT NECESSARILY BE ABLE TO TAKE THE ELLSWORTH
19:34:26  STREET ROUTE OFF THE SIDEWALK TO THE COURTYARD BUT THERE
19:34:29  IS AN ENTRANCE VIA AN ELEVATOR THAT
19:34:33 
COULD BE TAKEN FROM THE WEST
19:34:36  SIDE OF THE MIXED USE BUILDING.
THERE
19:34:39  IS A PEDESTRIAN DOOR THAT LEADS TO AN ELEVATOR THAT
19:34:42  WOULD PROVIDE ACCESS.
>> Commissioner Steckler:   THANK YOU.

19:34:48 >> Commissioner Daulton:   I HAVE A QUESTION.
MARK
19:34:51 , DOES THIS
19:34:57  ZONING REQUIRE 50% OF THE
19:35:00  COMMERCIAL -- OF THE BUILDING'S STREET FACING
19:35:03  SURFACE ADD TO BE COMMERCIAL IN THIS CASE, IS THAT RIGHT
19:35:09  FACING FACADE TO BE COMMERCIAL AT THIS
19:35:13  POINT IS THAT
RIGHT?
>> A GIVEN PORTION
19:35:16  OF THE FRONTAGE WOULD HAVE TO HAVE A COMMERCIAL FLOOR AREA FOR
19:35:19  THE FIRST 50 FEET OF PROPERTY DEPTH ALONG THAT FRONTAGE
19:35:23 .
>> Commissioner Daulton:   I  SEE, OKAY, THIS DOES MEET THOSE 
19:35:27 REQUIREMENTS?
>> IT DOES, YES.
THIS IS A CORNER SITE SO WE
19:35:30  CALCULATED BOTH FRONTAGES INDEPENDENTLY AND THE
19:35:33  PROPOSED COMMERCIAL AREA MEETS THAT 50%
19:35:36  THRESHOLD ALONG BOTH FRONTAGES
19:35:40 .
>> Commissioner Daulton:   AND I NOTICED THAT YOU MENTIONED THAT THE
19:35:43  SECOND FLOOR PATIO IS GOING TO BE PUBLICLY
19:35:46  ACCESSIBLE DURING THE DAY.
DOES THAT MEAN THERE'S
19:35:50  SECURITY REQUIRED IN THE EVENING, HOW IS THAT
19:35:53  GOING TO WORK?
>> YES, SO THE MISSION SAN JOSE
19:35:56  DESIGN GUIDELINES DO CALL FOR COURTYARDS.
AND THEY
19:35:59  CALL FOR THOSE COURTYARDS TO BE PUBLICLY ACCESSIBLE
19:36:03 .
AND ACCESSIBLE DURING DAYTIME HOURS OR BUSINESS
19:36:07  HOURS.
AND SO WE HAVE A CONDITION OF
19:36:11  APPROVAL STIPULATING THAT THAT IS A
19:36:15  REQUIREMENT.
IT WOULD BE UP TO THE DEVELOPER IF THEY WANTED TO INSTALL
19:36:18  ANY TYPE OF ACCESS CONTROL TO PROHIBIT AFTER
19:36:21 -HOURS USE.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   OH DOES THAT MEAN THAT IT CAN
19:36:24  BE OPEN TO THE PUBLIC, AFTER DARK?
19:36:27 
>> IT CAN BE.
YES.

19:36:30 >> Commissioner Daulton:   AND JUST TAKING NOTE THAT THE
19:36:34  ENTRANCE TO THIS DEVELOPMENT IS ON THE
19:36:38  BUSIER OF THE TWO STREETS ON THAT CORNER, IS
19:36:41  THAT GENERALLY
19:36:48  BEST PRACTICE?
>> WE HAD DISCUSSION
19:36:51  WITH THE ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT, FOR THE SUIT
19:36:54 ABLE LOCATION INTO THE PROJECT AND WASHINGTON BOULEVARD WAS
19:36:58  IDENTIFIED AS THE SORT OF THE
19:37:01  OPTIMAL LOCATION FOR THAT.
THERE
19:37:04  WASN'T ANY PUSH BACK OR DESIRE TO REQUIRE
19:37:07  IT TO BE OFF ELLSWORTH.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   OKAY.
ALL RIGHT
19:37:10  THANK YOU.
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMISSION?

19:37:13 IF NOT, I WOULD LIKE TO WELCOME THE
19:37:17  APPLICANT TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK.
DO WE HAVE AN
19:37:20  APPLICANT WHO IS GOING TO TALK ON THIS ITEM?
>> 
19:37:23 YES, HI, MY NAME IS RYAN, I HAVE LIKE
19:37:26  A SMALL LITTLE PRESENTATION AS WELL.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   THANK YOU RYAN
19:37:29 .
>> I'M GOING TO SHARE MY SCREEN RIGHT HERE.

19:37:43 ONE SECOND.

19:38:07 I'D HAVE TO REJOIN ZOOM IN ORDER TO SHARE
19:38:10  MY SCREEN.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   YOU WANT TO TRY THAT
19:38:14 ?
IS THERE ANYONE ELSE HERE WHO CAN SPEAK
19:38:17 ?
>> YES
19:38:20 , ACTUALLY OUR DESIGN TEAM IS HERE.
WE HAVE
19:38:23  MOHAMMED AS WELL THE CIVIL ENGINEER AND THE ARCHITECT AND I'LL TRY TO
19:38:27  REJOIN.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   OKAY.

19:38:35 TRISH, CAN YOU KEEP AN EYE OUT FOR HIM?
>> YES
19:38:39 , WILL DO, I'LL KEEP AN EYE OUT.
19:38:42 
>> SHALL I ALLOW THE TEN MINUTES FOR SPEAKER, COMMISSIONER
19:38:45 ?
>> Commissioner Daulton:   HERE WE GO.

19:38:48 YES PLEASE.
I THINK HE'S SHARING HIS SCREEN NOW HERE
19:38:52 .
>> ACTUALLY MY NAME IS MOHAMMED G
19:38:55 ENIDY WITH
19:38:59  THE ENGINEERS, PART OF THE DESIGN TEAM FOR THE PROJECT.
19:39:02 
AND WOULD I JUST LIKE TO
19:39:05  SHARE FEW OF THE DESIGN ELEMENTS FOR THE PROJECT
19:39:09  WITH THE AUDIENCE TONIGHT.
SO AS
19:39:13  MARK MENTIONED, THE
19:39:16  PROJECT BE
19:39:29  OBJECTIVELY MEETS IN TERMS OF THE BUILDING
19:39:30  FEET HEIGHT LIMIT WHICH IS IMPOSED BY THE
19:39:34  MISSION HISTORIC
GUIDELINES.
WHEREAS TOWN
19:39:37  CENTER ZONING FOR THE MIXED USE ALLOW UP TO 40
19:39:47  FEET.
SO THIS IS IN TERMS OF THE
19:39:49  WE TRIED ON THE DESIGN TO BREAK DOWN THE PROJECT
19:39:52  TO SMALLER BUILDINGS, TO KEEP
19:39:56  IT IN TERMS OF MASSING,
19:39:59  PROPORTIONAL TO THE SURROUNDINGS.
THEN IN TERMS OF
19:41:25 
THE 13 UNIT NUMBER OF UNITS
19:41:28 , ARE SUBDIVIDED BY THE TWO-THIRDS OF AN ACRE
19:41:32 , GENERIC DENSITY IS ABOUT 19 AND A HALF
19:41:35  UNITS PER ACRE.
SO THE PROJECT IS NOT PUSHING THE ENVELOPE
19:41:40  IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER OF UNITS
19:41:41 .
BIG DESIGN ELEMENT FOR PROJECT
19:41:45  WAS SUBSTANTIAL RETAIL COMPONENT
19:41:48  WHICH IS 50% OF THE BUILDING AREA WAS
19:41:51  IN 50 FEET SET BACK FROM THE PROPERTY LINE.
AND
19:41:55  THIS BASICALLY RESTRICTED OF WHAT ELSE
19:41:58  IT CAN BE BUILT FOR THOSE INITIAL UNITS
19:42:02 .
WE GOT SOME OF THE FEEDBACK FROM THE COMMUNITY AND THE NEIGHBOR
19:42:05 , AND THERE WAS OBJECTION
19:42:08  TO RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT FOR MISSION SAN JOSE
19:42:11 .
WE UNDERSTAND THAT
19:42:15  EVERYBODY NOW ENJOYING HIS HOUSE DOESN'T LIKE
19:42:18  NECESSARILY MORE UNITS OR MORE TRAFFIC
19:42:22  OR WHATEVER COMES WITH THE
19:42:25  NEW DEVELOPMENT.
BUT IT'S A BALANCE OF
19:42:28  NEED, MORE RESIDENTS NEED MORE HOUSING
19:42:32  UNITS IN FREMONT.
AND ONE WAY TO MEET THE AFFORDABILITY IS
19:42:35  TO MAKE MORE AVAILABLE.

19:42:39 SUPPLY AND DEMAND.
SO THIS
19:42:43  PARTICULAR LOCATION IS UNDERDEVELOPED.
19:42:46 
IT WAS A HOST FOR HOMELESS AND CRIMINAL
19:42:49  ACTIVITIES.
AND THE
19:42:52  OWNERS WERE GETTING COMPLAINT, A LOT,
19:42:55  FROM THE POLICE DEPARTMENT REGULAR BASIS.
19:42:59 
SO THIS VISION FOR THE
19:43:03  DEVELOPMENT WE BELIEVE IT ADDS VALUE IN TERMS OF GENERAT
19:43:06 ING MORE HOUSING UNITS FOR RESIDENTS OF FREMONT
19:43:10 .
IMPROVING THE SITE INSTEAD OF BEING
19:43:13  AN EYESORE FOR THE COMMUNITY.
THE
19:43:18  PROJECT UPDATES A SHARE
19:43:21  FAIR OF THE FEES AND ALSO IT MAKE USE OF THE
19:43:25  UNDERUSED SURPLUS LAND AT THE
19:43:28  FRONTAGE OF THE PROJECT.

19:43:32 THE PROJECT WENT THROUGH SEVERAL DESIGN ITERATION
19:43:36 S INCLUDING MULTIPLE ACCESS POINTS.
I HEARD A QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER
19:43:39  THE CURRENT LOCATION IS THE BEST ACCESS TO THE SITE
19:43:42 .
WE ACTUALLY WORKED WITH THE PUBLIC WORKS EXPLORING
19:43:46  DIFFERENT OPTIONS, AND THIS PARTICULAR LOCATION
19:43:50  WE PROPOSE RIGHT NOW IT ENTERS THE SIDE AND THE MIDDLE OF THE HEIGHT
19:43:54  OF THE PROJECT.
SO IT CREATE EASY ACCESS TO
19:43:56  THE PARKING, TO THE COURTYARD
19:43:59  THROUGH THE ELEVATOR, AND
19:44:03  ENABLE OVERALL HANDICAP ACCESS THROUGH ALL THE SITE.

19:44:12 RYAN, DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO ADD?
>> YES, I CAN --
19:44:15  I CAN SEE IF I CAN PULL UP MY SCREEN HERE.

19:44:18 AND MAYBE GO THROUGH MY PRESENTATION A LITTLE BIT.

19:44:23 I THINK I NEED YOU TO STOP
19:44:26  SHARING SCREEN FIRST.
>> YES.

19:44:32 >> Commissioner Daulton:   YES, MR. GENIDY
19:44:35  YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO -- THERE YOU GO, THANK YOU.
19:44:39 
>> YES, SO THIS IS MY SCREEN
19:44:42 .
I HAVE A SHORT PRESENTATION.
FIRST OFF I JUST WANT
19:44:46 ED TO SAY THANKS TO MOHAMMED AND
19:44:49  THANKS MARK STORE THEIR PRESENTATIONS.
THANKS FOR THE PLANNING
19:44:52  COMMISSION OBVIOUSLY FOR COMING OUT TO HEAR OUR PROJECT.
19:44:55 
AS MARK MENTIONED THIS IS GOING TO BE THE MISSION PARADISE
19:44:58  PROJECT ON 270 WASHINGTON BOULEVARD WHERE WE'RE
19:45:01  PROPOSING THE 13 RESIDENTIAL UNITS AND ONE COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT
19:45:07 .
I'M ACTUALLY HERE WITH MY  FAMILY.
THIS PROJECT ACTUALLY IS
19:45:09  A LITTLE SPECIAL TO US.
WE GREW UP IN FREMONT
19:45:12 .
I WEBSITE TO CHADBOURNE
19:45:15  AND HOPKINS AND MISSION SAN JOSE HIGH SCHOOL.

19:45:19 SO I THINK FOR ME ESPECIALLY IT IS
19:45:21  SOMEWHAT BITTERSWEET TO SEE CHANGE
19:45:52  IN THE CITY YOU GREW UP IN BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT
19:45:57  ELLSWORTH POINT OF VIEW.
JUST PULLED
19:45:58  FROM GOOGLE MAPS.
PINPOINTED IN
19:46:02  ITS PROXIMITY TO OTHER FREMONT ICON
19:46:05 IC BUILDINGS LIKE OWEN COLLEGES, THE
19:47:08  I BELIEVE MOHAMMED WENT OVER THIS A LITTLE BIT WHEN I WAS TRYING TO
19:47:11  FIX MY ZOOM.
SO THIS IS JUST GOING TO BE
19:47:14  THE DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS FOR THE TOWN CENTER
19:47:17  PEDESTRIAN ZONING DISTRICT.
WE OBVIOUSLY HERE AS YOU CAN
19:47:20  SEE WE HAVE COMPLIED WITH ALL THE STANDARDS.
19:47:24 
A BIG THING THAT WAS A VERY IMPORTANT ASPECT
19:47:27  FOR OUR PROJECT WAS THE RETAIL THAT WAS PREVIOUSLY
19:47:30  TOUCHED UPON.
WE NEEDED TO HAVE 50%
19:47:33  OF THE BUILDING WITHIN 50 FEET OF THE STREET
19:47:36 'S FRONTAGE TO BE RETAIL.
AS YOU CAN SEE HERE ON
19:47:40  THE SECOND RARELY WE DO HAVE THAT MET ON BOTH SIDES
19:47:43 .
ANOTHER BIG THING THAT WAS OF CONTENTION I
19:47:46  GUESS WAS THE BUILDING HEIGHT.
THE HARB ACTUALLY DOES
19:47:49  ALLOW FOR A 50 FOOT HIGH LIMIT IF IT'S LIKE
19:47:52  -- IF IT ISN'T --
>> RYAN I
19:47:56  JUST WANT TO WARN YOU THAT YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES LEFT.
>> 
19:47:59 OKAY NO PROBLEM, I'M STILL TRY TO SPEED THINGS UP
19:48:02 .
YES, I UNDERSTAND THERE IS A 30 FOOT OF HEIGHT
19:48:05  LIMIT FOR BUILDINGS SO OBVIOUSLY WE JUST WANTED TO COMPLY WITH THAT AS
19:48:08  WELL AND MAKE SURE THAT WE DO IMPLY WITH ALL THE ZONING STARTS
19:48:11  AND THAT WE DO
COMPLY WITH THE STATE LAW.
SO
19:48:14  HERE IS THE SITE PLAN.
I BELIEVE MOHAMMED
19:48:17  ALSO WENT OVER THIS A LITTLE BIT.
AS CAN YOU SEE HERE WE DO
19:48:21  HAVE FIVE BUILDINGS, FIVE RECTILINEAR BUILDINGS
19:48:24  JUTS TO MATCH WITH THE REVIVAL MISSION
19:48:27  HISTORIC ARCHITECTURAL STANDARDS.
ON THE LEFT HERE YOU CAN SEE THE PARK
19:48:30 ING TABLES THAT WE HAVE, AS MOHAMMED MENTIONED IT IS
19:48:34  25 REQUIRED RESIDENTIAL PARKING AND WE HAVE 30 HERE ON
19:48:37  OUR PROJECT.
WE ALSO DO MEET THE
19:48:40  REQUIRED COMMERCIAL PARKING AS WELL AS THE ADA PARKING.

19:48:43 WE ALSO DO HAVE BICYCLE PARKING SLOTS,
19:48:46  AS CAN YOU SEE THERE ON THE BOTTOM OF THE SITE PLAN, AS WELL
19:48:49  AS TWO SLOTS IN THE COURTYARD.
SO THESE ARE GOING TO BE
19:48:52  THE ELEVATIONS AS MARK PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED
19:48:55 .
AS CAN YOU SEE HERE WE DO HAVE THE
19:48:59  ENTRANCE TO THE RETAIL,
19:49:02  SO IT IS MORE INVITING FOR THE PEDESTRIANS AS
19:49:06  IT IS SUGGESTED IN THE DESIGN GUIDELINES FOR
19:49:09  MISSION SAN JOSE DISTRICT.
ON THE LEFT, CAN YOU SEE THE
19:49:12  ENTRANCE TO THE COURTYARD -- YOU CAN SEE
19:49:16  THE ENTRANCE TO THE COURTYARD MORE DIRECT
19:49:19  ENTRANCE TO THE COURTYARD WITH THE TRAIL SYSTEM.
TO
19:49:22  MAKE IT MORE ACCESSIBLE TO THE PUBLIC AND MORE INVITING FOR
19:49:25  THE PEDESTRIANS IN THE AREA.
HERE IN THE BOTTOM YOU SEE THE LINE
19:49:28  HEIGHT LIMIT OF 30 FEET.
AS CAN YOU SEE OUR BUILDING DOES
19:49:32  MEET THAT -- AS YOU CAN SEE OUR
19:49:35  BUILDING DOES MEET THAT -- HERE
19:49:38  IS AGAIN GOING TO BE THE ELEVATION FROM THE WASHINGTON BOULEVARD
19:49:41  SITE.
ONCE AGAIN MEETING THAT 30 FOOT HEIGHT
19:49:44  LIMIT, AS WELL AS I WANT TO SHOW OFF THE ARTICULATION
19:49:48  OF THE BUILDING SHOWING IT'S NOT ONE TOO
19:49:51  BIG MASSING AND NOT TOO BORING TO LOOK AT AND
19:49:54  ONE UNIQUE DESIGN.
HERE IS ONCE AGAIN ELEVATIONS JUST ONCE
19:49:57  AGAIN SHOWING OFF WHAT KIND OF A PROJECT WE'RE PUTTING ON
19:50:01  AND THE FACT THAT IT DOES SOMEWHAT FIT IN WITH
19:50:04  THE CHARACTER OF THE DISTRICT AND THE STYLE OF THE
NEIGHBORHOOD
19:50:09 .
19:50:14 
AKD ARE AND HERE'S --
>> RYAN
19:50:17  YOUR TIME IS UP.
HOW MUCH MORE TIME?
>> THIS IS ACTUALLY ONE
19:50:21  LAST SLIDE.
I WANTED TO TOUCH ON THE MATERIALS.

19:50:25 MARK TOUCHED ON IT A LITTLE BIT.
WE ARE GOING TO DO THE CONCRETE
19:50:28  TILES AND STUCCO BODIES WITH LIGHT COLORS.
19:50:31 
THIS PROJECT HAS BEEN ON PROCESS AND
19:50:34  WE WORKED REALLY HARD ON IT AND WE WANT TO MAKE
19:50:37  SURE WE IMPROVE THE COMMUNITY AND THE NEIGHBORHOOD WITH THIS
19:50:41  PROJECT.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   THANK YOU
19:50:44  RYAN.
19:50:59 
DO WE HAVE ANY SPEAKERS?
>> I HAVE ONE
19:51:02  SPEAKER, KELLY A YOU ARE NOW ALLOWED TO SPEAK,
19:51:05  GO AHEAD.
>> YEAH, SO WHAT WE'RE SEEING
19:51:08  HERE IS A CASE STUDY IN EXACTLY
19:51:11  HOW THE CITY'S DESIGN GUIDELINES AND
19:51:15  ARCHITECTURAL REQUIREMENTS AND TOWN
19:51:18  CENTER ZONING PLANS, WHATEVER, HOW THEY
19:51:22  DRIVE UP THE COST OF
HOUSING
19:51:25  TO STRATOSPHERIC LEVELS.
AND HOW THEY HAVE
19:51:28  KILLED THE URBAN CENTERS OF FREMONT
19:51:32 .
STEP 1 IS, YOU GOT A 30 FOOT HEIGHT LIMIT
19:51:37 .
STEP 2, YOU'VE GOT
19:51:40  27 SPACES,  2.3 SPACES
19:51:43  PER UNIT.
BUT IF YOU ADD IN THOSE 11
19:51:47  COMMERCIAL SPACES THAT NOBODY'S GOING TO BE USING AT MIDNIGHT
19:51:50  THEN WHAT HAVE YOU GOT, THREE SPACES PER UNIT
19:51:53 .
ENORMOUS AMOUNTS OF PARKING.
ENORMOUS.

19:51:56 AND THAT REALLY -- YOU KNOW, THAT COSTS MONEY
19:52:00  BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, THOSE CARS TAKE UP LAND.
AND THEN YOU HAVE
19:52:03  THIS HUGE COMMERCIAL SPACE.
THE AMOUNT OF
19:52:06  COMMERCIAL SPACE HERE EXCEEDS THE LEVEL OF --
19:52:09  THE COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT INTENSITY OF A TYPICAL BLOCK
19:52:13  IN DOWNTOWN PARIS, FRANCE
19:52:17  AND PARIS, FRANCE I REGRET TO INFORM YOU,
19:52:20  HAS A LOT MORE
URBAN DENSITY IN TERMS OF POPULATION
19:52:23  DENSITY THAN FREMONT DOES AND YOU'RE BUILDING MORE
19:52:26  COMMERCIAL SPACE THAT IF YOU LOOK AROUND IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD IS UNNEEDED
19:52:29  BECAUSE ALL THOSE COMMERCIAL SPACES
DOWN THE ROAD
19:52:33  ARE EMPTY OR CLOSED.
AND BECAUSE
19:52:36  YOU HAVEN'T BUILT ENOUGH HOUSING IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.
19:52:39 
THIS IS 20 UNITS AN ACRE, WHICH FREMONT SOME
19:52:43  PEOPLE WILL TELL YOU IT'S A HIGH DENSITY.
THIS IS LOW
19:52:46  DENSITY.
I LOOKED AT A LIST OF
19:52:49  HIGH DENSITY TYPES OF HOUSING, THE BOTTOM OF THEIR LIST
19:52:52  WAS 20 UNITS AN ACRE AND THIS IS
19:52:55  SLIGHTLY UNDER THAT SO IT IS BELOW THE RANGE FOR ANY KIND OF HIGH
19:52:58  DENSITY.
SO JUST ADD IT ALL UP AND
19:53:01  YOU SEE VERY HIGH COST AND 1700
19:53:04  SQUARE FEET PER UNIT.
19:53:08 
PER UNIT.
THAT'S A HUGE UNIT
19:53:11 .
THAT'S KIND OF NICE AND KIND OF EXPENSIVE.

19:53:14 THAT'S WHY THINGS COST SO MUCH.
THANK YOU
19:53:18 .
>> Commissioner Daulton:   THANK YOU, KELLY.

19:53:21 ALL RIGHT.
19:53:28 
I THINK --
>> CHAIR DAULTON,
19:53:31  THIS IS TRISH.
WE DID HAVE A HAND BUT THEN IT
19:53:34  WENT AWAY.
DO WE HAVE ANY MORE SPEAKERS THAT WOULD LIKE TO
19:53:37  SPEAK  TONIGHT?
DO YOU WANT TO RAISE YOUR HAND?
I
19:53:41  DID SEE TWO HANDS THAT WENT  UP.
I'LL
19:53:44  INTRODUCE THE NEXT SPEAKER.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   THANK YOU.
19:53:48 
>> ANDRES, GO AHEAD AND SPEAK, YOU
19:53:51  HAVE PERMISSION TO SPEAK  NOW.
>> GOOD EVENING
19:53:54 , ANN DURESS  PEDAVAN
19:53:58 IC, BIKE FREMONT.
19:54:01 
WITH REGARDS TO THE BIKE  PARKING, THERE IS A SET OF A COUPLE
19:54:04  OF BIKE RACKS, I THINK IT'S IN THE RIGHT ON
19:54:07  THE FLOOR PLAN, THERE'S TWO OF THEM CLOSE TOGETHER.
BOTH
19:54:11  OF THOSE ARE WITHIN TWO FEET OF A
19:54:14  WALL.
WHICH IS LESS THAN
19:54:17  THE PRESCRIBED MINIMUM DISTANCE IN THE
19:54:21  BIKE MASTER PLAN WHICH CALLS FOR AT LEAST THREE FEET OF CLEARANCE,
19:54:24  IF YOU'RE NEXT TO A WALL.
SO THAT WOULD NEED
19:54:28  TO BE ADDRESSED IN MY VIEW, THANK YOU.

19:54:33 >> Commissioner Daulton:   THANK YOU, SIR.
>> CHAIR
19:54:36  DAULTON I DO SEE ANOTHER HAND, I'LL INTRODUCE THE
19:54:39  NEXT SPEAKER JUST A MOMENT.
A PHONE NUMBER ENDING
19:54:42  IN 1365.
GO AHEAD AND SPEAK.

19:54:52 >> THIS IS ALICE CAV
19:54:55 ETTE.
HOW MANY MINUTES DO WE HAVE
19:54:57 ?
>> Commissioner Daulton:   TWO MINUTES.

19:55:00 >> AND CHRIS WILL BE TAKING A TURN AFTER ME.
I DO NOT
19:55:03  AGREE WITH STAFF'S ANALYSIS THAT MISSION PARADISE MEETS
19:55:06  THE MISSION SAN JOSE HISTORIC DESIGN GUIDELINES OR ALL
19:55:09  OBJECTIVE STANDARDS.
HARB'S SPLIT VOTE
19:55:12  LEGALLY SAYS THAT THE PROJECT DOES NOT MEET THE
19:55:15  MISSION SAN JOSE DESIGN GUIDELINES.
THE BUILDING
19:55:19  MASSING AND ARCHITECTURAL CHARACTER DOES NOT MEET
19:55:23  THE GUIDELINES REQUIREMENT TO COMPLEMENT THE NEIGHBORHOOD
19:55:26 .
ELLSWORTH HOMES BETWEEN WASHINGTON AND A
19:55:29 NZA ARE ALL SMALL WITH CLAPBOARD
19:55:33  SIDINGS, NOT FOUR
19:55:36  BEDROOM STUCCO TOWN HOUSES RIGHT BY
19:55:39  THE SIDEWALK.
COMPARE MISSION PARADISE
19:55:44  WITH THE HORIZON SCHOOL AND ACROSS WASHINGTON,
19:55:47  THE GUIDELINES SAY THAT THE GABLE
19:55:50  ROOFERS AND BROAD OVERHANGS, STAFF SAYS
19:55:54  THE BUILDINGS CONDITION TAKEN LONG
19:55:58  OVERHANGING EAVES
BUT
19:56:02  SHEET 2.5 SHOWS FLAT EAVES
19:56:05  BOTTLED ON TO THE EDGES.
I CANNOT FIGURE OUT
19:56:08  HOW STAFF SAYS THE WASHINGTON AND ELLSWORTH
19:56:12  MINIMUM COMMERCIAL COMPONENTS ARE AT LEAST
19:56:15  50%.
THE PLAN SHOWS WIDTHS
19:56:19  OF 55 FEET TWO INCHES AND 50 FEET NOT THE
19:56:22  58 FEET AND 53 FEET CLAIMED BY THE DEVELOPER
19:56:25 .
WHAT ARE THEY ADDING?
HOW EXACTLY DID
19:56:28  STAFF CALCULATE THE 60 FOOT
19:56:32  WIDE ELLSWORTH RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS
19:56:35 , 50 FOOT FRONTAGE SQUARE FOOTAGE
19:56:39 ?
THE UNIT DENSITY DOESN'T HAVE TO BE
19:56:42  LOWER TO HAVE ARCHITECTURE
19:56:46  THAT COMPLEMENTS THE NEIGHBORS OR FOR UNITS TO HAVE SMALLER
19:56:49  FOOTPRINTS THAN THESE 2,000 SQUARE FOOT TOWN HOMES
19:56:52 , INCREASE IT WITH FLATS
AND SHARED PARKING
19:56:56  PARKING.
DISAPPROVE THIS PROJECT OUTRIGHT OR TABLE IT
19:57:00  UNTIL YOU'VE HAD TIME TO ASK STAFF FOR
19:57:03  DETAILED JUSTIFICATION OF WHY IT MEETS THESE STANDARDS
19:57:05 .
THANK YOU.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   THANK YOU, 
19:57:09 ALICE.
>> HERE IS CHRIS.

19:57:14 >> GOOD EVENING, MY NAME IS CHRIS
19:57:17  CAVETTE.
THE
19:57:20  APPLICANT CLAIMS THIS FROAM COMPLIES WITH ALL THE OBJECTIVE
19:57:23  STANDARDS.
I DON'T DISAGREE.
SPECIFICALLY I THINK FOOTNOTE
19:57:27  THAT SPECIFICALLY GRANTS A RIGHT
19:57:30  TO PUBLIC PARKING SPACES ON PUBLIC STREET AS
19:57:33  PART OF THE  OFFSTREET COMMERCIAL COMPONENT IS
19:57:36  NEVER AN OBJECTIVE STANDARD AND NEVER WAS.
AT THE TIME THE FOOTNOTE
19:57:40  WAS WRITTEN IT IS SIMPLY ADVISED THERE WAS A POSSIBILITY
19:57:44  THIS COULD BE DONE ON A CAIS SCAIS BASIS.
THAT IS WHY
19:57:46  THE WORDING, MAY BE COUNTED WAS USED
19:57:49  INSTEAD OF SHALL BE ALLOWED TO BE COUNTED AND WHY THE EXAMPLE
19:57:57  ESPECIALLY ON RETAIL FRONTAGE WAS INCLUDED FOR GENERAL
19:57:59  SEEMS CLEAR TO ME THAT THIS FOOTNOTE HAS ALWAYS BEEN A
19:58:02  SUBJECTIVE STANDARD.
UNDER THE CURRENT STATE LAW, CITIES
19:58:06  CANNOT CONSIDER SUBJECTIVE STANDARDS TO
19:58:09  EVALUATE A PROPOSAL AND THEREFORE I BELIEVE THIS FOOTNOTE
19:58:12  IS  INVALID, AND DOES NOT GRANT ANY RIGHTS TO
19:58:15  THE APPLICANT.
THE ONLY OBJECTIVE
19:58:18  PARKING STANDARD THAT REMAINS IS THE ONE
19:58:21  THAT REQUIRES ALL MIXED USE DEVELOPMENTS TO PROVIDE A CERTAIN MINIMUM
19:58:25  NUMBER OF  PARKING SPACES, OFF THE STREET,
19:58:28  FOR BOTH
RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL OCCUPANCIES
19:58:32 .
I'VE LOOKED LONG AND HARD AT THIS PROPOSAL
19:58:35 , AND IT STILL DOESN'T WORK, AS FAR AS I CAN SEE.
19:58:38 
I ASK YOU TO DISAPPROVE THIS
19:58:40  PROPOSAL.
THANK YOU.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   THANK YOU 
19:58:44 CHRIS.
TRISH IS THAT OUR
19:58:47  LAST SPEAKER?
>> THAT IS OUR LAST SPEAKER, THANK YOU.
19:58:49 
>> Commissioner Daulton:   OKAY, AT THIS TIME I'D LIKE TO INVITE THE 
19:58:53 APPLICANT TO RETURN FOR REBUTTAL TO THOSE COMMENTS, IF THEY WOULD
19:58:56  LIKE, OR FURTHER COMMENTS AND I'LL GIVE THEM FIVE
19:58:59  MINUTES.
ANY TAK
19:59:02 ERS?
>> YES, HI.
19:59:05 
I'LL SPEAK ON THAT
19:59:07 .
>> Commissioner Daulton:   THANK YOU.
>> NO PROBLEM.

19:59:10 I JUST WANT TO TOUCH ON THE ZONING STANDARDS I GUESS WERE A
19:59:14  LITTLE IN QUESTION THERE.
I ACTUALLY DO BELIEVE THAT
19:59:17  OUR PROJECT DOES MEET THE
19:59:20  MISSION HISTORICAL ARCHITECTURAL
19:59:24  DESIGN GUIDELINE THAT WAS PUT IN QUESTION BY THE CALLER
19:59:27 .
I BELIEVE THAT'S, I BELIEVE
19:59:30  THAT WAS PART OF THE PROCESS THAT WE TOOK.
WE DID
19:59:34  HAVE MULTIPLE MEETINGS WITH OUR CONSULTANTS AND OUR DESIGNS TEAM IN ORDER
19:59:38  TO PROVIDE A PROJECT THAT DOES MEET THOSE STANDARDS AND THEY
19:59:41  ARE VERY EXPERIENCED IN THE FIELD.
THEY DID LOOK
19:59:45  AT THE DESIGN GUIDELINES VERY WELL.
AND ALSO IN TERMS OF
19:59:48  THE ZONING GUIDELINES, I BELIEVE THAT IT'S
19:59:51  NOT SUBJECTIVE, WE DID HAVE THE TABLE THERE AND WE
19:59:55  DID MEET ALL THE ZONING GUIDELINES THAT
19:59:58  WERE IN PLACE FOR OUR PROJECT.
I DON'T KNOW
20:00:01  IF ANYONE ON THE DESIGN TEAM WANTS TO TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT
20:00:04  THAT.

20:00:11 MAYBE MOASMED OR FAYED.
>> THIS IS MOHAMMED
20:00:14 .
WOULD I LIKE TO COMMENT ABOUT THE WAY
20:00:18  TO CALCULATE
20:00:21  RETAIL REQUIREMENTS.
IT'S 50% OF THE
20:00:25  AREA WITHIN 50 FEET FROM THE
20:00:28  PROPERTY LINE, THIS NEED TO BE RETAINED, MINIMUM
20:00:31  50% OF THAT AREA.
20:00:34 
SO WHAT COUNTS TOWARDS
20:00:37  AN INNER FRONTAGE, WE TAKE, A LINE 50
20:00:40  FEET AWAY FROM THE PROPERTY LINE AND THEN MEASURE THE RESIDENTIAL AREA
20:00:43  WITHIN THAT 50 FEET AND THEN MEASURE THE RETAIL
20:00:46  AREA WITHIN THAT 50
FEET.
AND BASICALLY,
20:00:50  THE RETAIL NEED TO BE 50% OR MORE.
SO
20:00:53  THE RESIDENTIAL CAN BE 60 FEET DEEP
20:00:57  BUT ONLY WITHIN 50 FEET THIS IS WHAT COUNTS.
SO THIS
20:01:01  MAY EXPLAIN THE MATH HOW TO MEET BASICALLY
20:01:04  THE DEFINITION IN THE ORDINANCE.
AND I
20:01:08  WILL LEAVE THE STAFF TO CONFIRM
20:01:11  THIS, AND THIS WENT
20:01:14  THROUGH SEVERAL CALCULATION AND CONFIRMATION BETWEEN
20:01:18  THE DESIGN TEAM AND
20:01:20  THE STAFF.
THANK YOU.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   THANK YOU.

20:01:24 THAT'S ALL FROM THE APPLICANT.
THEN I
20:01:27  WILL BE CLOSE
20:01:30 ING THE PUBLIC HEARING.

20:01:35 AND COMING BACK TO THE COMMISSION FOR
20:01:38  ANY FURTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS
20:01:42 .
ALTHOUGH MARK I WOULD APPRECIATE IT IF YOU
20:01:46  WOULD COMPLETELY CLARIFY
20:01:49  THIS, THE RETAIL FRONTAGE ISSUE.
IS IT
20:01:53  FROM THE CORNER OF WASHINGTON AND ELLSWORTH
20:01:56  THAT WE MEASURE 50 FEET, AND THEN LOOK AT THE
20:02:00  AMOUNT OF RETAIL FRONTAGE IN THAT 50 FEET
20:02:03 ?
>> THAT'S CORRECT, YES.
SO OFF OF EACH
20:02:06  FRONTAGE YOU WOULD MEASURE 50 FEET INTO THE PROPERTY
20:02:09 .
AND THEN WITHIN THAT 50 FOOT AREA,
20:02:13  THE RETAIL OR THE TREAT COMMERCIAL COMPONENT WOULD NEED TO
20:02:16  ENCOMPASS AT LEAST 50% OF THE FLOOR AREA
20:02:20 .
AND AS SHOWN IN THE CALCULATIONS WITHIN THE
20:02:23  PLANS, IT DOES MEET THOSE STANDARDS.

20:02:26 STAFF DID DO OUR OWN ROUGH CALCULATIONS TO
20:02:30  VERIFY, THAT THE DIMENSIONS AND
20:02:33  NUMBERS THAT ARE PROVIDED BY THE APPLICANT IN
20:02:37  THEIR PLANS ARE CORRECT.
I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT MAY
20:02:40  THROW PEOPLE OFF IS THAT THE RESIDENTIAL PORTIONS, THE
20:02:43  RESIDENTIAL UNITS THEMSELVES, THEY ARE SET
20:02:46  BACK IN ALL CASES AT LEAST FIVE FEET.
20:02:49 
AND FOR HALF OF THEIR FRONTAGE, TEN TEET, TO
20:02:56  FEET TO PROVIDE PATIOS, FOR COMMERCIAL SPACE
20:02:59 S BUILT ESSENTIALLY TO THE PROPERTY  LINE.
20:03:03 
WHEN YOU MEASURE BACK 50 FEET, TEN FEET
20:03:06  ON AVERAGE FOR THE RESIDENTIAL UNITS IS NOT GOING TO COUNT.
20:03:10 
OR OR THE
20:03:13  FOR THE RESIDENTIAL PORTIONS BECAUSE THAT IS
20:03:16  ACTUALLY OUTDOOR OPEN SPACE AREAS, WHEREAS
20:03:20  THE COMMISSIONER CALCULATION ACTUALLY STARTS AT PROPERTY LINE
20:03:23  LINE.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   OKAY, SO QUESTIONS FROM COMMISSIONERS OR
20:03:26  COMMENTS, PLEASE?
20:03:32 
KN
20:03:35 NOBODY.
ANYBODY?
COMMISSIONER ZHANG
20:03:40 .
>> Commissioner Zhang:  
20:03:43  CAN YOU COMMENT ON THE OTHER ELEMENT LIKE THE FLATTER ROOF
20:03:46 , IS THERE ACTUALLY SUCH REQUIREMENT
20:03:50 ?
>> SO THE MISSION SAN JOSE DESIGN GUIDELINES, THEY ARE
20:03:54  NOT A PRESCRIPTIVE DOCUMENT, LIKE YOU SEE
20:03:57  A LOT OF THE MORE RECENT DESIGN GUIDELINE DOCUMENTS
20:04:02 .
WE'RE IN AN AGE THESE DAYS OF OBJECTIVE STANDARDS.

20:04:05 AND SO DESIGN GUIDELINE DOCUMENTS HAVE HARD AND
20:04:09  FAST PRESCRIPTIVE DESIGN RULES THAT WOULD HAVE TO BE MET BY A
20:04:12  PROJECT.
BUT THAT'S NOT THE CASE WITH THE MISSION SAN JOSE DESIGN
20:04:16  GUIDELINES, WHICH IT'S -- JOEL
20:04:20  CAN CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG BUT I BELIEVE IT'S ABOUT A 20
20:04:23  20-YEAR-OLD DOCUMENT.
IT HAS A LOT OF SHOULDS,
20:04:26  BUT  NO -- YOU KNOW VERY LITTLE
20:04:29  WHEN IT COMES TO SHALLS SO MANDATORY MEASURES.
AND
20:04:33  THE DESIGN GUIDELINES GO ON FURTHER
20:04:36  TO BASICALLY POINT OUT THE DIVERSE ARRAY OF BUILDING
20:04:40  TYPES AND ARCHITECTURAL STYLES AND ROOF
20:04:43  FORMS WITHIN THE DISTRICT.
IT SPECIFICALLY, YOU KNOW,
20:04:46  WHEN IT COMES TO ROOF FORMS MENTIONS WITHIN THE
20:04:49  GUIDELINES ON SECTION 6.0 ON
20:04:52  PAGE 19, THAT A VARIETY OF ROOF FORMS
20:04:55  IS PERMITTED AND THAT FLAT ROOFS ARE AMONG
20:04:59  THOSE STYLES
CONTEMPLATED FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS.
AND THAT
20:05:02  FOR FLAT ROOF BUILDINGS, THE GUIDELINES ENCOURAGE
20:05:05  A DISTINCTIVE ROOF LINE ELEMENT WHICH THE
20:05:09  PROJECT PROVIDES WITH THE LONG S TILED
20:05:12  EAVES THAT ARE IN THE MISSION REVIVAL STYLE.

20:05:22 >> Commissioner Daulton:   DOES THAT ANSWER YOUR QUESTION, COMMISSIONER
20:05:24 ?
>> Commissioner Zhang:   YES, THANK YOU.

20:05:27 I HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE DEVELOPER.
FOR THE RETAIL
20:05:30  PLACE DO YOU HAVE ANY LIKE A SORT OF BUSINESS IN MIND
20:05:33  LIKE A RESTAURANT, COMMUNITY STORE,
20:05:37  OR ANY --
>> Commissioner Daulton:   CAN I AT THIS TIME CALL THE
20:05:40  APPLICANT BACK FOR A MOMENT
20:05:44 ?
>> Planner Pullen:   YES, SO
20:05:47  CHAIR BECAUSE THIS IS A PRETTY COMPLEX MEETING WITH A LOT
20:05:50  OF FOLKS, I'VE ASKED THE
20:05:53   CO-SECRETARIES TO DEMOTE FOLKS WHEN THEY OPEN
20:05:56  MARTIN LUTHER KING HEARING IS OVER.
SO WE'LL NEED TO PROMOTE THEM
20:06:00   DEN TO HEAR FROM THEM.
SORRY ABOUT THAT.
YLT
20:06:03 
>> Commissioner Daulton:   I  SEE.
>> OKAY, JOEL
20:06:06  AND CHAIR YOU WOULD LIKE ME TO --
>> Commissioner Daulton:   IF YOU
20:06:09  COULD BRING RYAN BACK MAYBE FOR A MOMENT.
20:06:12 
>> JUST FOR A MOMENT, I'LL MOVE THEM, GIVE ME
20:06:15  A MOMENT, THANK YOU.
RYAN IS BACK AS A PANEL
20:06:19 IST.
20:06:21 
>> Commissioner Daulton:   RYAN DID YOU HEAR THE QUESTION?

20:06:24 >> YES I GOT IT.
AS OF RIGHT NOW WE DON'T HAVE
20:06:27  ANY REALLY PLAN AS TO WHAT KIND OF BUSINESS WOULD BE THERE.
I
20:06:30  THINK POSSIBILITIES OF ANY BUSINESS THAT COULD BE THERE IS QUITE END
20:06:34 LESS AND, YOU KNOW, THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENT BUSINESSES THAT
20:06:37  PROBABLY ARE FITTING FOR THAT SPOT.
SO BUT WE
20:06:40  DON'T HAVE ONE IN  MIND, YEAH.

20:06:46 I HOPE THAT ANSWER HE YOUR QUESTION.
>> Commissioner Zhang: 
20:06:49   THANK YOU.
>> Commissioner Daulton:  
20:06:52   MR. LIU.
20:06:56 
>> Commissioner Liu:   I HAVE A QUESTION FOR APPLICANT.

20:06:59 RYAN WHEN YOU DESIGNED THE BUILDING DID YOU TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE
20:07:02  COST OF THE BUILDING BEING PROBABLY THE  LOWEST, WAS
20:07:05  THAT THE CONSIDERATION THAT WENT INTO IT?
IN LIGHT
20:07:10  OF THE SKYROCKETING BUILDING COST I REALIZE
20:07:13  THAT SOME OF THE PROJECTS THAT WE
20:07:16  PREVIOUSLY FROOIVED NEVER TERMED
20:07:19  APPROVED NEVER MATERIALIZE
20:07:22 ED BECAUSE THE BUILDING COST HAS GONE UP SO MUCH.
20:07:25 
SO WE'RE NOT REALLY SEEING THE HOUSING THAT WE
20:07:30  NEED TO BE ACTUALLY BUILT.
SO
20:07:33  TELL ME ABOUT
20:07:36  THE CONSIDERATION THAT WENT INTO IT.
FIRST OF ALL
20:07:39 , DO YOU INTEND TO DEVELOP IT AND BUILD IT
20:07:43  URSA OR DO YOU PLANNED TO ENTITLE IT AND JUST MAYBE SELL
20:07:46  IT LATER ON?
>> YES,
20:07:49  SO RIGHT NOW, OBVIOUSLY,
20:07:52  FROM THIS POINT I GUESS AND TO WHEN WE GET
20:07:55  THE BUILDING PERMIT WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO EXACTLY KNOW HOW
20:07:59  THE BUILDING COSTS WOULD CHANGE IN TERMS OF I GUESS THE LABOR
20:08:02 
COSTS AND MATERIAL COSTS.
SO IT'S I GUESS FOR
20:08:05  US IT'S PROBABLY HARD TO TELL RIGHT NOW.
BUT WE WERE
20:08:09  JUST FOLLOWING THE BUILDING MATERIALS THAT WERE SET FORTH IN THE
20:08:12  DESIGN GUIDELINE AND MATCHING, MAKING SURE THAT WE DO
20:08:15  FOLLOW THE MATERIAL AND, YOU KNOW, THE STRUCTURAL OF WHAT THE
20:08:18  DESIGN
TEAM PUT FORWARD IN OUR PROJECT PLANS
20:08:23 .
>> Commissioner Liu:   SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT
20:08:26  THE -- ANY PROJECTS THAT WE
20:08:30  ACTUALLY PROPOSE, IF THEY'RE
20:08:33  ACTUALLY VIABLE, BECAUSE SO MANY PROJECTS
20:08:36  IN THE PAST, THEY ARE STILL SITTING OUT
20:08:39  THERE
DOING NOTHING.
SO WE NEED
20:08:42  HOUSING FAST.
20:08:49 
SO YOU HAVEN'T SPOKEN WITH ANY BANKS ON THE COST
20:08:52  AND DO YOU HAVE YOUR OWN FINANCING OR WHAT IS
20:08:56  YOUR CONSIDERATION?

20:09:00 >> I ACTUALLY ON OUR SIDE WE DO HAVE LIKE PRODUCE OUR
20:09:03  OWN FINANCING TO WHERE WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO FINISH THE
20:09:06  PROJECT.
>> Commissioner Liu:   SO YOU'RE GOING TO BUILD
20:09:10  IT YOURSELF, NOT TO SELL
20:09:13  THE ENTITLED PROJECT RIGHT?
>> WE DO HAVE A GENERAL
20:09:16  CONTRACTOR COMPANY THAT WE DO WORK WITH.

20:09:19 YES, THAT THEY HAVE A LOT OF EXPERIENCE
20:09:23 .
THEY'VE BUILT A FEW
20:09:26  PROJECTS IN SAN CARLOS SO WE DO HAVE A
20:09:33  GENERAL CONTRACTOR THAT WE DO WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH.
>> Commissioner Liu:   YOU
20:09:36  DO HAVE TEN MORE FEET OF BUILDING HEIGHTS I THINK TO PLAY WITH
20:09:39 .
HAVE YOU CONSIDERED LIKE A HIP ROOF,
20:09:44  OR THAT CAN BE ON THE DESIGN?
>> SO
20:09:47  THE ISSUE WITH THE BUILDING HEIGHT WAS THAT THE EXTRA HEIGHT WOULD HAVE
20:09:50  BEEN REQUIRED OR APPROVED BY THE HARB COMMITTEE
20:09:54 .
SO WE JUST STUCK WITH THE 30-
20:09:57  30-FOOT HEIGHT ON IT.
THAT WAS JUST SET FORTH IN THE
20:10:01  ZONING STANDARDS.
>> Commissioner Liu:   OKAY
20:10:04 , THANK YOU.
>> NO PROBLEM, THANK YOU.

20:10:08 >> Commissioner Daulton:   ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMISSIONERS
20:10:12 ?
20:10:18 
NO?
I HAVE TO SAY I'M STARTING TO 
20:10:23 UNDERSTAND A LITTLE BIT MORE CLEARLY WHY THIS PROJECT WAS TURNED DOWN
20:10:27  BY HARB.
IT DOES HAVE SOME ISSUES REGARDING THE
20:10:30  HISTORICAL FEELING OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD.
20:10:35 
I DO WISH
20:10:38  THAT, IF THEY WERE
20:10:41  GOING TO CREATE A BUILDING THAT IS THIS BIG
20:10:45 , THIS IMPORTANT OF A SPACE, THAT IT HAD A LITTLE MORE
20:10:48  DENSITY, SO THAT WE COULD GET SOME MORE UNITS OUT
20:10:51  OF THIS MUCH LAND.
IT SEEMS
20:10:54  LIKE FAIRLY EXTRAVAGANT PIECE OF BUILDING
20:10:58  FOR THE MIDDLE OF
20:11:02  WHAT IS
20:11:06  -- WHAT WE'VE ALL JUST LISTENED TO FOR AN HOUR
20:11:10  THE CRISIS IN HOUSING IN FREMONT.

20:11:13 WELL, IF THERE ARE NO MORE COMMENTS,
20:11:17  THEN, I WOULD LOOK FOR A MOTION ON
20:11:20  THIS PROJECT.
20:11:25 
CAN I GET A MOTION FROM THE COMMISSION?
20:11:28 
>> SORRY, IF I COULD JUST --
>> Commissioner Daulton:   YES,
20:11:31  RYAN?
>> SO THE ISSUE WITH THE DENSITY WAS AT FIRST WE WERE TRYING
20:11:35  TO GET OBVIOUSLY MORE UNITS FOR THE PROJECT.
BUT
20:11:38  WE DID RUN INTO
20:11:41  A PROBLEM WITH MEETING THE PARKING STANDARDS THAT WERE SET FORTH SO
20:11:44  THAT'S WHERE WE WERE AT ON THAT JUST TO PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT
20:11:47  OF CLARITY.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   THANK YOU.
I WILL MAKE
20:11:50  A COMMENT ON THAT AND I WILL SAY THAT IF
20:11:54  YOU WOULD LIKE A PEDESTRIAN ORIENT
20:11:57 ED ENVIRONMENT THEN YOU'RE GOING TO -- IN MISSION SAN JOSE
20:12:00 , THEN YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DO WHAT WE DO IN NILES,
20:12:04 
WHICH IS HAVE A PUBLIC DEDICATED PARKING
20:12:07  LOT SO THAT PEOPLE CAN DRIVE IN AND WALK AROUND
20:12:11 .
IT'S NOT IDEAL, BUT THIS IS
20:12:15  A COMMUNITY THAT'S WITHIN A BASEBALL THROW OF A
20:12:18  FREEWAY ENTRANCE AND PEOPLE DO DRIVE
20:12:21  THERE.
SO AGAIN, MY FEELING
20:12:24  IS THAT THIS IS SOMEWHAT OF A WEAK PROJECT FOR THIS
20:12:27  SITE.
IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN DENSER.
BECAUSE THE
20:12:30  IMPORTANT PART ABOUT BUILDING ON THIS SITE IS GET
20:12:33 TING FEET ON THE GROUND TO THE RETAIL BUSINESSES IN
20:12:36  THIS AREA.
AND THIS IS QUITE A LARGE LOT.
20:12:40 
AND WE GET 13 UNITS OUT OF IT
20:12:43 .
THAT'S NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE.
WE'RE
20:12:46  NOT GOING TO OPEN NEW BUSINESSES WITH
20:12:50 , YOU KNOW, 25, 28 PEOPLE
20:12:53 .
WE'RE GOING TO OPEN NEW  BUSINESSES WITH CONSIDERABLY
20:12:57  LARGER AMOUNTS OF PEDESTRIAN TRAFFIC THAN THAT.
20:13:00 
AND IF YOU WANT PEOPLE TO COME VISIT
20:13:05  HISTORIC MISSION SAN JOSE, THEN YOU NEED A PLACE FOR THEM TO PARK.
AND
20:13:09  YOU SHOULD PROBABLY CREATE A PARKING DISTRICT SOMEWHERE OR THE THOSE
20:13:12  CARS TO WIND UP SO THAT WE DON'T
20:13:15  WIND UP, YOU KNOW,
20:13:18  WITH FURTHER STRIP MALLS
20:13:22 , AND THE DEVELOPMENT CAN PROCEED ON THE BASIS
20:13:25  OF
THIS BEING A
20:13:28  HISTORY DESTINATION OR A COMMUNITY DESTINATION
20:13:33 .
AS FAR AS THE BUILDING DESIGN GOES
20:13:36 , I MEAN, IT'S OKAY.
YOU KNOW,
20:13:39  I DON'T REALLY HAVE A BIG ROB WITH THE FLAT ROOF
20:13:42  HERE.
I'M MUCH MORE INTERESTED IN
20:13:45  OPTIMIZING, YOU KNOW, THE PRAGMATIC ASPECTS OF
20:13:49  TRYING TO SAVE RETAIL IN THIS AREA
20:13:52 .
AND THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN WITH 26
20:13:55  PEOPLE IN 2000 SQUARE
20:13:58  FOOT LUXURY HOMES ON ELLSWORTH.
20:14:01 
I JUST LOOK AT WHAT'S THE
20:14:04  EXISTING HOMES THERE, AND CONTEXTUAL
20:14:08 LY, IT'S A LITTLE CRAZY.
BUT AS FAR
20:14:11  AS I'M CONCERNED, THAT'S THE REAL ISSUE.

20:14:15 ALL RIGHT.
SO IF THERE ARE NO MORE COMMENTS
20:14:18  COMMENTS, AH,
20:14:21  COMMISSIONER ZHANG YOU HAVE A COMMENT
20:14:25 .
>> Commissioner Zhang:   YES, I KIND OF LIKE THE DESIGN,
20:14:28  ALTHOUGH I HAVE AN ISSUE WITH THE FLAT ROOF.
IT
20:14:31  WOULD BE BETTER IF IT  DOESN'T.
BUT I UNDERSTAND
20:14:34  IT HAS TO MEET THE
20:14:38  HEIGHT, THE HEIGHT REQUIREMENT.
20:14:43 
BUT THE SURROUNDING
20:14:47  BUILDINGS
20:14:51  ISN'T PRETTY AS WELL
20:14:54 .
SO GET BETTER THAN -- SO I
20:14:58  WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A MOTION TO  APPROVE.
>> Commissioner Daulton:  
20:15:01  WE HAVE A MOTION TO APPROVE.
CAN
20:15:04  I GET A SECOND?
>> Commissioner Yee:   I'LL SECOND
20:15:07 .
>> Commissioner Daulton:   JOEL WE HAVE A MOTION AND SECOND
20:15:11  FROM ZHANG
20:15:15  AND YEE.
CAN I GET A ROLL CALL ON THIS ITEM
20:15:18 ?
>> Planner Pullen:   YES CHAIR ON MOTION TO APPROVE STAFF RECOMMENDATION
20:15:22  WHEN I CALL YOUR NAME PLEASE STATE YOUR VOTE.
CHAIRPERSON
20:15:25  DAULTON, YES.
VICE
20:15:28  CHAIR RAO, YES.

20:15:32 COMMISSIONER YEE, YES.
20:15:35 
COMMISSIONER STECKLER.
NO.

20:15:42 NO?
>> Commissioner Steckler:   NO.
20:15:45 
>> Planner Pullen:   SORRY, HARD TO HEAR.

20:15:48 COMMISSIONER LIU.
>> Commissioner Liu:   YES
20:15:51 .
>> Planner Pullen:   COMMISSIONER ZHANG
20:15:55 .
>> Commissioner Zhang:   YES.
>> Planner Pullen:  
20:15:58  AND COMMISSIONER BASRAI.
>> Commissioner Basrai:   YES.
>> Planner Pullen: 
20:16:01   OKAY.
SO I'VE RECORDED THE VOTE AS 6
20:16:04  TO 1 IN FAVOR OF THAT MOTION.
20:16:08 
COMMISSIONER STECKLER  DISSENTING.
THIS PROJECT HAS BEEN
20:16:11  APPROVED, THE PLANNING COMMISSION ACTION ON THIS ITEM IS FINAL.
20:16:14 
UNLESS APPEALED TO THE CITY COUNCIL WITHIN TEN CALENDAR DAYS
20:16:18  DAYS.
CHAIR, BACK TO YOU.
BUT I WOULD WANT TO MAKE
20:16:21  A COMMENT BEFORE WE GO TO -- WE'RE ABOUT DUE
20:16:24  FOR A BREAK.
MIGHT BE GOOD TO HAVE THAT BREAK
20:16:28  BEFORE WE START THE NEXT ITEM.
HOWEVER
20:16:32 , I DO WANT TO SUGGEST THAT WE
20:16:35  POTENTIALLY TAKE THE  DA'S OUT OF
20:16:38  ORDER, TO GET THEM TAKEN CARE OF.
SINCE THE
20:16:41  MAJORITY OF PEOPLE ARE ON THOSE DA'S IF THEY
20:16:44  ARE, REMEMBER WE WEREN'T ABLE TO ADD THOSE TO CONSENT
20:16:47 .
SO IF THERE AREN'T A LOT OF COMMENTS ON THEM THAT MIGHT BE
20:16:51  THE BEST USE OF:00 FOR THE MOST PEOPLE ON THE CALL.
20:16:54 
YOUR CALL, CHAIR.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   OKAY.

20:16:57 WELL, IN THAT CASE I THINK WE CAN JUST MOVE TO THE NEXT ITEM
20:17:00  ON THE AGENDA AND SEE HOW QUICKLY IT GOES.

20:17:03 SO IF YOU WILL JOEL INTRODUCE THE NEXT
20:17:06  ITEM.
PARC 55.

20:17:13 >> Planner Pullen:   WILL DO.
LET ME AND A HALF GATE TO THAT
20:17:16  DOCUMENT.

20:17:22 ALL RIGHT.
SO THE NEXT ITEM ON THE AGENDA IS
20:17:25  THE PARC 55 DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT ANNUAL REVIEW
20:17:28 .
THIS IS AT 47003
20:17:32 -TREF-320 MISSION
20:17:44  FALLS COURT, DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT FOR THE MISSION FALLS FORMER
20:17:48 LY DESCRIBED AS PARC 55 SENIOR

20:17:58  DWELLING UNITS
AND A NEW PUBLIC SENIOR COMMUNITY CENTER ON 23.5 ACRES IN THE WARM 
20:18:04 SPRINGS COMMUNITY PLANNING AREA.
AND THERE ARE FINDINGS FOR REVIEW
20:18:09  CEQA 15378 NOT A PROJECT,
20:18:13  AND PREVIOUSLY ADOPTED MIFGHT
20:18:22  MITIGATED NEGATIVE PRESENTATION.
THIS PROJECT DOES NOT HAVE
20:18:25  A PRESENTATION FROM STAFF HOWEVER JAMES WILLIS
20:18:28  IS AVAILABLE FROM STAFF TO SPEAK TO ANY QUESTIONS THAT MAY ARISE
20:18:30 .
>> Commissioner Daulton:   THANK YOU JOEL.

20:18:33 COMMISSIONERS DO WE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FOR JAMES
20:18:38  AT THIS TIME
20:18:45  REGARDINGS THIS DA?
I DON'T SEE ANY?
ANY QUESTIONS
20:18:48  OF STAFF?
IF THERE ARE NONE
20:18:51  I'LL TAKE A MOTION.
>> Commissioner Yee:   I MAKE A MOTION TO
20:18:55  ACCEPT STAFF RECOMMENDATION ON THIS.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   JOEL
20:18:58  WE HAVE TO ASK FOR PUBLIC COMMENT ON THIS ITEM.
>> Commissioner Yee: 
20:19:02   THAT'S RIGHT, WE'RE JUMPING THE GUN.
20:19:05 
>> CHAIR DAULTON, I DON'T SEE ANY HANDS BUT I'LL
20:19:09  REPEAT THAT.
IF THERE IS ANYBODY THAT WOULD LIKE TO
20:19:12  SPEAK, PLEASE RAISE YOUR HAND AND WE'LL GIVE YOU PERMISSION
20:19:16 .
I'M NOT SEEING ANY RAISED HANDS, SO I
20:19:20  FEEL CONFIDENT THAT WE CAN MOVE FORWARD.
I DON'T
20:19:23  SEE ANY --
>> Commissioner Daulton:   ALL RIGHT ON THAT CASE I DO HAVE A
20:19:26  MOTION BY COMMISSIONER YEE.
DO I HAVE A SECOND
20:19:29 ?
>> Commissioner Rao:   I SECOND THAT.
20:19:33 
>> Commissioner Daulton:   SECOND
20:19:36 .
JOEL WOULD YOU ROLL CALL.
>> Planner Pullen:   WHEN I CALL YOUR 
20:19:39 NAME PLEASE STATE YOUR VOTE IN SUPPORT OF STAFF
20:19:43  RECOMMENDATION ON THE PROJECT.
CHAIR DAULTON TO START.

THE VOTE IS 7-0 AND APPROVAL OF
20:20:11  STAFF RECOMMENDATION, THAT ITEM IS APPROVED.
BACK TO YOU CHAIR.
20:20:14 
AND THIS WOULD BE THE TIME
20:20:17  WHERE WE WOULD EITHER GO TO TRIPLE E
20:20:20  PLAZA OR PERHAPS TO THE OTHER  DAs AT
20:20:23  YOUR OPTION.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   LET'S TAKE ITEM NUMBER
20:20:26  6, PACIFIC COMMONS, CAN YOU DO THAT ONE
20:20:31 ?
20:20:41 
>> Planner Pullen:   SURE CAN.
FOR BENEFITS OF THE PEOPLE ON THE
20:20:44  CALL WE'RE TAKING ITEM 6 OUT OF ORDER AND WOULD COME BACK
20:20:48  TO TRIPLE E PLAZA AND CHEVRON
20:20:52  ANNUAL REVIEW.
IF YOU ARE ON THOSE ITEMS PLEASE DON'T LEAVE.
20:20:55 
WE'LL STILL BE HEARING THOSE ITEMS.
SO WITH THAT,
20:20:58  PACIFIC COMMONS SOUTHEAST AND WEST PARCELS
20:21:02  DA ANNUAL REVIEWS, LOCATED
20:21:05  AT 5780 BUNCH
20:21:09 E DRIVE.
CONSISTING OF
20:21:12  TWO AND A HALF MILLION SQUARE FEET OF INDUSTRIAL BUILDINGS AND 100
20:21:15 ,000 SQUARE FOOT OF AUTO MALL BUILDINGS ON 153
20:21:19  ACRES LOCATED ON BOTH SIDES OF
20:21:22  CUSHING PARKWAY SOUTH OF
20:21:25  NOBLE AND BUNCHE
DRIVE
20:21:28  IN THE COMMUNITY PLAN AREA, AND TO CONSIDER A FINDING
20:21:31  THAT'S NO FURTHER ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW IS REQUIRED PURSUANT THE
20:21:35  CEQA GUIDELINES 17378 NOT A PROJECT
20:21:38  AND ADDITIONALLY BECAUSE IT'S
CONSISTENTLY WITH THE EIR THAT WAS
20:21:41  DONE WITH THE PREVIOUS PROJECT AS LISTED
20:21:45  IN THE AGENDA ITEM.
BACK TO YOU CHAIR.

20:21:54 THERE IS NO
20:21:58  PRESENTATION ON THIS AS WELL.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   VERY WELL, I WOULD
20:22:01  ASK COMMISSIONERS IF THEY HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ON
20:22:05  THAT?
DO WE HAVE ANY PUBLIC COMMENTS
20:22:08 ?
>> YES WE DO WE HAVE TWO HANDS.
I'LL
20:22:11  START WITH THE FIRST SPEAKER, INTRODUCE THAT PERSON
20:22:14 .
STEVE SCALA GO AHEAD AND SPEAK PLEASE,
20:22:17  YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES.

20:22:20 >> THANK YOU.
STEVE SCALA.
I'D
20:22:24  LIKE TO DRAW YOUR ATTENTION
20:22:27  TO INFORMATIONAL ITEM 5 WHICH IS
20:22:30  THE ILLUSTRATIVE
20:22:33  SIDE MAP.
THE SITE MAP IS SHOWING
20:22:36  THE PUBLIC FACILITIES THAT ARE PART OF THIS AGREEMENT.
YOU
20:22:40  HAVE THE BAY TRAIL MULTI
20:22:43 USE TRAIL, POCKET PARKS AND
20:22:46  LINEAR PARKS.
ONE THING YOU DID NOT SHOW ON
20:22:49  THIS TRAIL IS ANY PUBLIC PARKING
20:22:52  PARKING.
THAT'S BECAUSE THE ONLY PUBLIC PARKING IS
20:22:55  THE LITTLE BIT AT THE VERY END OF CHRISTY STREET
20:22:58 .
NOW ALL THESE PUBLIC FACILITIES, THE NEAR
20:23:02 EST RESIDENCE IS 1.5 MILE WALK ACROSS 8
20:23:05 80.
THERE IS VERY NICE BICYCLE ACCESS SO YOU DO HAVE
20:23:08  THAT.
BUT NOT EVERYBODY CAN BICYCLE
20:23:12  TO THIS AREA, AND YOU ESPECIALLY DON'T HAVE
20:23:16  ANY ADA PARKING.
I THINK THIS WAS A MAJOR
20:23:19  OVERSIGHT,
20:23:24  WHEN THIS PLAN WAS APPROVED.
THERE IS PARKING AVAILABLE OFF
20:23:27  OF CUSHING BY PACIFIC COMMONS BOULEVARD BY BUILDING
20:23:30  10 AND BUILDING 1.
BUILDING 10 IS ACTUALLY
20:23:33  RIGHT BY THE PRIMARY ENTRANCE GATEWAY.
IT IS
20:23:37  CURRENTLY PRIVATE, NOBODY CAN PARK THERE, NO PUBLIC PERSON
20:23:40  CAN PARK THERE.
WHAT I REALLY WOULD ASK THE COMMISSIONERS TO
20:23:44  DO, I KNOW IT'S OBVIOUSLY PAST
20:23:47  THIS AGREEMENT BUT IT'S NEVER TOO LATE TO
20:23:50  ASK, IF THE CITY COULD OBTAIN SOME RIGHTS OR
20:23:54  LEASE AGREEMENTS TO SOME PARKING OFF
OF CUSHING
20:23:57 .
ESPECIALLY FOR ADA.
SO I WOULD
20:24:01  ASK THE COMMISSIONERS TO KINDLY DO
20:24:04  THAT, AND PLEASE LOOK SERIOUSLY, ESPECIALLY
20:24:07  AT THE LACK OF ADA PARKING FOR
20:24:10  THESE PUBLIC FACILITIES.
THANK YOU.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   THANK YOU
20:24:14 , MR. SCALA.
TRISH DO WE HAVE
20:24:17  ANOTHER  SPEAKER?
>> YES WE DO.
THE NEXT
20:24:20  SPEAKER IS KELLY A.
KELLY CAN YOU NOW SPEAK AND
20:24:23  YOU'LL HAVE TWO MINUTES.
THANK YOU.
20:24:26 
>> YEAH, I WANT TO KNOW WHAT
20:24:29  MR. SCALA IS DOING.
HE STOLE MY TOPIC
20:24:33  BUT I'LL GO INTO IT JUST LIKE HE DID.
YEAH
20:24:36  THERE'S NO PARKING.
DRIVE AROUND THIS NEIGHBORHOOD,
20:24:39  WALK AROUND.
YOU'LL SEE NO PARKING SIGNS EVERYWHERE.

20:24:43 YOU SEE STREETS THAT ARE 45 FEET WIDE, ON
20:24:46  BUNCHE DRIVE THAT ARE OVER 70 FEET WIDE ON CUSHING
20:24:49  PARKWAY, YOU HAVE
20:24:52  GIANT PARKING LOTS EVERYWHERE, THAT ARE PRIVATELY OWNED
20:24:56 .
AND NO --
20:25:00  NO CONCEPT OF  PUBLIC-PRIVATE SHARING YOU KNOW
20:25:03 .
THIS IDEA WE DON'T NEED TO BUILD PARKING
20:25:06  EVERYWHERE, WE DON'T NEED TO PAVE EVERYTHING, WE CAN ALL SHARE
20:25:09  AND SHARE ALIKE AND PLAY TOGETHER AND SHARE OUR 
20:25:12  TOYS, NO.
FREMONT, IT'S ALL THIS
20:25:16  IDEA OF PRIVATE PARKING
20:25:19  LOTS.
SO THERE'S A PACIFIC COMMONS LINEAR
20:25:22  PARK.
IT'S A NICE LITTLE TRAIL THAT ACTUALLY
20:25:25  I THINK A PRIVATE DEVELOPER BUILT IT.
BUT VERY
20:25:29  NICE AND SUPPOSED TO GO OUT TO LOOK AT
20:25:32  SOME BIRDS OUT THERE IN LIKE
20:25:35  A NATURE SANCTUARY NEARBY AND YOU
20:25:38  CAN'T GET TO THAT BECAUSE NOBODY CAN PARK ANYWHERE
20:25:42  ANYWHERE.
THIS IS THE KIND OF INDUSTRIAL WASTE LAND
20:25:45  THAT'S BUILT INTO A WASTE LAND BY DESIGN
20:25:48 .
BY DESIGN WHERE WE STERILIZE THE PRIVATE PARK
20:25:52 ING LOTS, WE HAVE THESE GIANT BIG BOX
20:25:55  STRUCTURES, AND WE MAKE IT SO THAT NOBODY CAN
20:25:58  WALK ON THOSE SIDEWALKS.
NONE OF THE
20:26:01  OUTSIDERS.
MAYBE THE EMPLOYEES CAN, THE ONES WHO ARE
20:26:04  PARKED IN THOSE PRIVATE PARKING LOTS.
BUT OTHER PEOPLE
20:26:08  WHO ARE NOT LEGALLY SUPPOSED TO BE ABLE TO WALK DOWN
20:26:11  THOSE STREETS BECAUSE THEY WON'T FIND ANY PARKING
20:26:14  ON THIS SIDE OF THE ROAD.
AND YOU GENERATING PARKING ON
20:26:17  THE SIDE OF THE ROAD OVER THERE AT MISSION SAN JOSE FOR THAT PRIVATE
20:26:20  DEVELOPMENT JUST NOW.
SO YEAH, THERE IS A LOT OF
20:26:23  OPPORTUNITY HERE, THANKS.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   THANK YOU KELLY
20:26:27 .
TRISH IS THAT IT ON PUBLIC SPEAKERS?
>> THAT IS IT.
20:26:30 
NO MORE HANDS RAISED SO WE'RE GOOD, THANKS
20:26:33 .
>> Commissioner Daulton:   OKAY COMMISSIONERS DO YOU HAVE ANY OTHER 
20:26:37 QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FOR STAFF?
I WOULD ASK
20:26:40  THE STAFF PLANNER ON THIS
20:26:44  TO TAKE A CRACK AT MR. SCA
20:26:47  MR. SCALA'S POINT.
REGARDING PARKING AT THE
20:26:50  LINEAR PARK.
>> SURE, SO THE DEVELOPMENT
20:26:53  AGREEMENT DOES NOT COVER PARKING AT THE SITE.
AND
20:26:56  SO IT'S A LITTLE BIT OUTSIDE THE SCOPE OF THE REVIEW
20:26:59  TONIGHT.
THIS WAS
20:27:02  SECRETARY PULLEN'S PROJECT SO MAYBE HE COULD SPEAK TO THE ORIGINAL
20:27:06  DESIGN INTENT BEHIND SOME OF THE PARKING FACILITIES THERE.
20:27:09 
>> Planner Pullen:   THANK YOU FOR THAT, FOR TOSSING THAT
20:27:12  QUESTION OVER.
YES, ACTUALLY I'VE USED THE TRAIL WITH
20:27:15  MY FAMILY BEFORE SINCE DEVELOPMENT OF THE
20:27:19   PROJECT.
THERE ARE PARKING FACILITIES.
THEY'RE
20:27:22  NOT PLENTIFUL I'LL SAY.
20:27:25 
THE PLAN WAS TO PROVIDE PARKING FOR
20:27:28  THE PEOPLE WHO WORKED THERE,
20:27:31  AND WHO FREQUENT THE SITES, WHO MAY ALSO
20:27:34  PERHAPS ON THE LUNCH BREAK GO DOWN TO THE
20:27:38  POCKET  PARK, CIRCULATE THROUGH
20:27:41  PACIFIC COMMONS.
I'VE SEEN PEOPLE FREQUENTLY WALKING
20:27:44  AROUND THE TARGET ON THAT WIDE SIDEWALK.
SOME
20:27:47  PEOPLE SEEM TO PARK AT THE COMMERCIAL FACILITIES.
I DON'T KNOW IF THEY
20:27:51  POLICE THAT HEAVILY.
THE BEST PARK
20:27:54 ING IS AROUND  BUNCHE, THERE IS STRIPE PARK
20:27:57 ING ALONG THE BACK OF THE THEATER AND ALONG THE ENTIRE ROADWAY
20:28:01  FROM ROUGHLY THE BLOCK THROUGH THE AUTO MALL.
THERE IS
20:28:04  ALSO SOME PARKING ON BRANDON COURT THAT IS
20:28:07  PRETTY NEAR THE OTHER
20:28:10  END OF THE -- I GUESS THE EAST END I SHOULD SAY AND THEN
20:28:13  AT THE END OF CHRISTY THERE ARE A FEW SPACE
20:28:16 S DOWN THERE THAT MR. SCALA
 REFERRED
20:28:20   TO.
BUT I THINK IT'S A GOOD COMMENT.
I THINK
20:28:23  TO THE EXTENT THAT WIRE ABLE TO WORK WITH OUR PUBLIC WORKS
20:28:26  COLLEAGUES AND SEE IF THERE CAN BE SOME ADDITIONAL SPACES BUILT INTO
20:28:29  THE STREETSCAPE LONG TERM I THINK THAT'S A GOOD ADD.

20:28:32 SO I'LL REACH OUT TO TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING AND SEE
20:28:35  IF THAT'S SOMETHING THEY CAN CONSIDER.
AGAIN NOT
20:28:38  WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS PROJECT
20:28:42  BUT A WELCOME COMMENT.

20:48:31  DEVELOPMENT CONSISTING OF 3500 SQUARE
20:48:34  FEET, PRESCHOOL BUILDING AS WELL AS
20:48:37  EIGHT RESIDENTIAL TO BE HOME UNITS

20:48:44 TONIGHT'S PRESENTATION WILL BEGIN WITH AN OVERVIEW OF THE
20:48:48  REQUIRED PERMITS AND SOME BACKGROUND ON THE
20:48:51  PROJECT SITE.
HE WILL THEN PROVIDE AN OVER VIEW OF THE
20:48:54  PROPOSED PROJECT AND ANALYSIS OF THE ZONING PERFORMANCE.

20:48:58 FINALLY, MAY PRESENTATION WILL CONCLUDE WITH STAFF'S
20:49:01  RECOMMENDATION.
THE PROJECT BEFORE YOU TONIGHT REQUIRES APPROVAL OF
20:49:05  THREE PERMITS.
FIRST A CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT IS
20:49:08  REQUIRED TO ALLOW MIXED USE DEVELOPMENT ON THE SITE,
20:49:11  WHICH IS ZONED COMMERCIAL
20:49:15  OFFICE.
IT IS ALSO REQUIRED TO ALLOW THE DAYCARE
20:49:18  USE IN THE COMMERCIAL OFFICE ZONE.
ADDITIONALLY,
20:49:21  A DISCRETIONARY DESIGN REVIEW PERMIT
20:49:24  IS REQUIRED TO REVIEW THE PERFORMANCE OF THE
20:49:27  PROJECT DESIGN WITH THE APPLICABLE CITY
20:49:30  DESIGN GUIDELINES.
PROBABLY, THE PROJECT REQUIRE
20:49:33  AS TENTATIVE PROJECT MAP FOR PURPOSES
20:49:37  TO' HOW THE COMMERCIAL AND RESIDENTIAL UNIT TO BE SOLD
20:49:40  SEPARATELY FROM ONE ANOTHER.
THE PROJECT SEAT CONSISTS OF TWO
20:49:44  PARCELS TOTALING APPROXIMATELY 1.47 GROSS
20:49:48  ACRES.
IT HAS A GENERAL PLAN DISI CAN NATION
20:49:52  OF GENERAL COMMERCIAL AND A CORRESPONDING ZONING
20:49:56  DESIGNATION OF COMMERCIAL OFFICE.
THE GENERAL COMMERCIAL
20:49:59  DESIGNATION APPLIES TO
20:50:02  LOWER SCALE COMMERCIAL USES AND OFFICE USES TYPICALLY LOCATED AROUND THE
20:50:05  CITY'S ARTERIAL AND COLLECTOR STREETS.
MIXED USE
20:50:08  PROJECTS IN TECH ARE PERMITTED WITHIN THE
20:50:12  RETAIL AND OFFICE-ORIENTED GENERAL COMMERCIAL ZONING
20:50:16  DISTRICTS INCLUDING OFFICE COMMERCIAL WHICH IS WHAT THIS
20:50:19  SITE IS
20:50:24   ZONED.
THE SUBJECT SITE WAS DEVELOPED WITH A RESIDENTS AND
20:50:27  STRUCTURES IN AND AROUND 1959, HOWEVER THOSE
20:50:31  BUILDINGS WERE DEMOLISHED DOWN TO THEIR
20:50:35  FOUNDATIONS IN 1993 AND STAINS TIME THE SEAT HAS REMAINED
20:50:38  LARGELY VACANT.
THE BROWN ROAD AREA CONTAINS A
20:50:43  MIXES OF RESIDENTIAL, COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL USES
20:50:47  SURROUNDING THE PROJECT
20:50:51  SEAT.
IN 2020, A NEW HOTEL WAS COULD BE INSTRUCTED
20:50:54  IMMEDIATELY ACROSS THE ROAD FROM THE PROJECT SITE.
OTHER
20:50:58  SEATS ARE TYPICALLY INDUSTRIAL IN NATURE THERE ALSO
20:51:01  COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS LOCATED TO THE SOUTH AND TO THE
20:51:04  EAST OF THE PROJECT
20:51:07  SITE.

20:51:11 A MAJOR CONSIDERATION OF THE SITE IS THE CREEK THIS RUNS
20:51:14  ALONG THE PROJECT
20:51:17  SEAT'S SOUTHERN PROP
20:51:22  LINE
20:51:25  YOU CAN SEE THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT PORTION ON THE BANKS
20:51:29  ARE THE CREEK.
CITY DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS
20:51:32  AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS PREVENT DEVELOPMENT WITHIN 20
20:51:35  FEET IN THE TOP OF BANK.
WHEN THIS CREEK SET BACK IS TAKEN INTO
20:51:39  CONSIDERATION, THE USEABLE ACREAGE OF THE SITE DECREASES
20:51:42  TO ONLY .81 NET ACRES.
OBVIOUSLY
20:51:45  THE LOCATION OF THE CREEK AND THE REDUCTION
20:51:48  IN USEABLE AREA GREATLY INFORMED THE SEAT PLANNING FOR
20:51:52  THE PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT
20:51:58  THE APPLICANT PROPOSES TO CONSTRUCT
20:52:02  TWORETION DENY SHALL TOWN HOME BUILDINGS AND ONE PRESCHOOL SITE
20:52:05  AS PART OF A HORIZONTAL MIXED USE PROJECT.
THE
20:52:08  PROJECT WOULD BE ACCESSED FROM BROWN ROAD,
20:52:12  VIA THREE SEPARATE DRIVEWAYS.
TWO WOULD BE CONNECT BADE
20:52:15  ROADWAY THAT ENCIRCLES THE TWO RESIDENTIAL
20:52:19  BUILDINGS.
THAT ROADWAY WOULD PROVIDE ACCESS TO EIGHT
20:52:22  PRIVATE TWO-CAR
20:52:25  GARAGES, SEVEN GUEST
20:52:30  PARKING SPACES AND FOUR PARKING SPACES FOR THE PRESCHOOL BUILDING.
THE THIRD DRIVEWAY WOULD EXCLUSIVELY 
20:52:34 ACCESS AN EIGHT-SPACE PARKING LOT THAT WOULD BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE
20:52:38  PRESCHOOL BUILDING
20:52:42 .
THE RESIDENTIAL COMPONENT OF THE
20:52:45  PROJECT WOULD CONSIST OF TWO FOUR UNIT, THREE
20:52:48  STORY TOWN HOME BUILDINGS.
EACH RESIDENTIAL
20:52:51  UNIT WOULD HAVE THREE BEDROOMS AND
20:52:55  APPROXIMATELY 1900 SQUARE FEET IN TOTAL AREA, INCLUDING
20:52:59  A 470 SQUARE FOOT PRIVATE TWO CAR GARAGE
20:53:02  LOCATED ON THE GROUND FLOOR.

20:53:06 PEDESTRIAN ENTRANCES TO EACH UNIT WOULD BE PROVIDED FROM THE
20:53:09  BROWN ROAD FRONTAGE.
ADDITIONALLY, EACH
20:53:12  UNIT WOULD CONTAIN THREE BALCONIES
20:53:15  BETWEEN 58 AND 75 SQUARE FEET
20:53:19  IN AREA.
THE COMMERCIAL PORTION OF THE PROJECT WOULD CONSIST
20:53:22  OF A ONE STORY CHILDCARE
20:53:25  BUILDING WITH A 1550 SQUARE FOOT OUTDOOR PLAY
20:53:29  AREA.
THE FACILITY WOULD OFFER
20:53:33  DAYCARE SERVICES FOR CHILDREN UP TO 12 YEARS
20:53:36  OF AGE.
THE MAXIMUM CAPACITY OF THE
20:53:39  FACILITY WOULD BE 96
20:53:44  CHILDREN.
THE HOURS OF OPERATION OF 7:00
20:53:48  A.M. TO 7:00 P.M., IT WOULD OFFER FULL DAY AND HALF
20:53:52  DAY PROGRAMS.
THEY WOULD HAVE STAGGERED START AND
20:53:55  END TEAMS TO REDUCE THE TRAFFIC AT THEY GIVEN TIME THAT IS
20:53:58  ASSOCIATED WITH PICK UP AND
20:54:01  DROP OFF.
AS A WHOLE, THE
20:54:05  PROPOSE PROJECT WOULD BE CONSISTENT WITH ALL THE APPLICABLE
20:54:08  ZONING STANDARDS SUCH AS BUILDING HEIGHT, BUILDING
20:54:11  FRONTAGE, SET BACKS AND FAR.
AS
20:54:14  SHOWN ON THISLY ISD AND DESCRIBED IN FURTHER DETAIL
20:54:17  IN YOUR STAFF REPORT TONIGHT.
THE
20:54:22  MUNICIPAL CODE ALSO REQUIRES MIXED USE PROJECTS
20:54:27  CONTAIN A SUBSTANTIAL COMPONENT
20:54:30  WITH ADEQUATE DEPTHS
20:54:33  TO SUPPORT VARIOUS TENDENCIES.
IT IS WITHIN
20:54:37  REQUIREMENTS FOR MIXED USE DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS.
WHILE PURPOSE
20:54:40  BUILD AS A PRESCHOOL, THE COMMERCIAL
20:54:44  COMPONENT WOULD HAVE SUFFICIENT CEILING HEIGHTS
20:54:47  AND DEPTHS TO CON STREET ANOTHER USE IN THE FUTURE.

20:54:50 THE MULTI FAMILY RESIDENTIAL PORTION OF A MIXESED
20:54:53  USE DEVELOPMENT IS ADDITIONALLY GOVERNED BY THE MULTI
20:54:57  FAMILY RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT STANDARDS MOST
20:55:01  SIMILAR IN NATURE AND FUNCTION OF THE RESIDENTIAL PORTION OF THE
20:55:04  MIXED USE DEVELOPMENT IN THIS CASE, THE PROJECT IS
20:55:07  MOST SIMILAR IN NATURE TO THE R311 DISTRICT.

20:55:10 THE RESIDENTIAL PORTION OF THE PROJECT WOULD BE CONSISTENT WITH ALL
20:55:14  OF THE' PLICCABLE ZONING STANDARDS REGARDING BUILDING
20:55:18  SPACING, COMMON OPEN SPACE, PRIVATE OPEN SPACE
20:55:21  AND STORAGE.
FINALLY, THE
20:55:26  PROPOSE PROJECT WOULD ALSO BE CONSISTENT WITH ALL
20:55:29  APPLICABLE PARKING REGULATIONS.
THE PROJECT
20:55:32  PROVIDES MORE THAN THE MINIMAL AMOUNT OF REQUIRED AUTOMOBILE
20:55:35  PARKING FOR BOTH THE RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL
20:55:39  COMPONENTS IT.
ALSO PROVIDES
20:55:42  BOAST LONG AND SHORT-TERM BICYCLE PARKING FACILITIES
20:55:45  CONSISTENT WITH THE REQUIREMENTS
20:55:49  OF THE MUNICIPAL CODE.
THE PROJECT IS ALSO
20:55:52  CONSISTENT WITH CITY DESIGN GUIDELINES RELATED TO
20:55:55  SEAT PLANNING AND ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN.
AS PREVIOUS
20:55:59  REMIXED, THE SITE IS CONSTRAINED BY THE CREEK AND THE SEAT PLAN
20:56:02  RESPONDS TO THE REQUIRED CREEK SET BACK BY
20:56:05  PLACING THE BUILDINGS WITH A STRONG STREET
20:56:09  PRESENCE ALONG BROWN ROAD.
THIS PLACEMENT MIRRORS THE PLACEMENT
20:56:12  OF THE HOTEL BUILDING DIRECTLY ACROSS THE STREET AND ALSO
20:56:16  THE COMMERCIAL BUILDING IMMEDIATELY TO THE EAST OF THE
20:56:19  SUBJECT SITE.
THE MAIN ENTRANCES TO ALL THE RESIDENTIAL
20:56:22  UNITS AND TO THE PRESCHOOL BUILDING WOULD FACE THE
20:56:25  PUBLIC SIDEWALK AND THE STREET WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH A MULTI
20:56:29  FAMILY AND CITY WIDE DESIGN GUIDELINES.

20:56:37 ALL THE ALLINAS WITHIN THE PROJECT WOULD HAVE A MODERN ARCHITECTURAL STYLE WITH COLORS,
20:56:40  FORMS AND MATERIALS.
TWO RESIDENTIAL
20:56:43  BUILDINGS WOULD BE CONSTRUCT WAD HIGH SENSITIVE TIME OUT
20:56:46  MASS AND BULK.
THE BALANCE CON FEES AND
20:56:50  OTHER THINGS WOULD BREAK IT INTO SMALLER,
20:56:53  READABLE FORMS TO REDUCE THE APPEARANCE OF BULLING FROM THE
20:56:56  STREET.
THE RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS HAS
20:57:00  MULTIPLE COLOR AND MATERIAL APPLICATIONS IN A
20:57:04  CONSISTENT MANNER.
THE COMMERCIAL BUILDING IS
20:57:07  PLAYING OFF THE DETAILS OF THE RESIDENTIAL
20:57:11  BUILDINGS, NOTION LARGE AND TRANSPARENT ALUMINUM WINDOWS ON
20:57:14  THE STREET-FACE FASHION SAD.
ON THIS
20:57:17  BUILDING, PAINTED WOOD
20:57:23  CLADDING WOULD ANCHOR THE BUILDING ENTRANCE ON THE EAST SEED OF THE BUILDING, WHICH WOULD BE CONSISTENT 
20:57:27 WITH THE CITY WIDE DESIGN GUIDELINES.

20:57:30 ADDITIONALLY, THE LANDSCAPE AND OPEN SPACE DESIGN OF THE PROJECT
20:57:34  IS CONSISTENT WITH OBJECTIVE DESIGN RULES
20:57:37  CONTAINED WITHIN THE MULTI FAMILY AND CITY WIDE DESIGN
20:57:40  GUIDELINES.
THE PROJECT WOULD NOT REMOVE OR
20:57:44  DISTURB ANY TREES.
INSTEAD IT WOULD
20:57:48  ADD 34 NEW TREES THAT WOULD MOSTLY BE PLANTED IN
20:57:51  THE REAR OF THE SITE TONIGHT HANDS
20:57:54  THE OPEN SPACE FRAME.
INDEED, THE PROJECT TAKES FULL ADVANTAGE
20:57:57  OF THE OPEN SPACE SET BACK BY INCORPORATING A
20:58:01  SHARED PATIO AREA AND ME ANDERRING
20:58:08  NATURE ACTUALLY IN THIS AREA AS A UNIQUE AND CONTEXT SENSITIVE AMENITY OF FUTURE RESIDENTS OF THE 
20:58:12 DEVELOPMENT.
EACH OF THE RESIDENTIAL UNITS HAS TWO
20:58:15  REAR FACING BALCONIES THAT OVERLOOK THE CREEK.

20:58:18 THE ORIENTATION OF THESE BALCONIES ENHANDSES
20:58:21  THE QUALITY OF THE PRIVATE OPEN SPACE
20:58:24  PROVIDED AND
20:58:29  CREATES NATURAL SURVEILLANCE OF THE YEAR YEAR AND THE NATURE TRAIL TO DISCOURAGE TRESPASSING.

20:58:32 ON THE COMMERCIAL SIDE OF THE DEVELOPMENT,
20:58:35  THE PRESCHOOL PLAY AREA WOULD HAVE AGE
20:58:39  APPROPRIATE PLAY EQUIPMENT ON SYNTHETIC TURF
20:58:42  AND MULCH.
BENCHES AND A WATER FOUND
20:58:45  TOWN WOULD PROVIDE ADDITIONAL
20:58:49  AMEND AMENITY IN THIS AREA THAT CONCLUDES STAFF'S
20:58:53  REVIEW OF THE PROPOSED PROJECT.
THE PROJECT IS
20:58:56  SUBJECT TO THE HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY ACT WHICH
20:58:59  STATES THE CITY CANNOT REDUCE THE
20:59:02  PROJECT THAT COMPLIED WITH ALL GENERAL
20:59:06  PLANNING AND ZONING STANDARDS AND CRITERIA UNLESS FINDINGS
20:59:09  CAN
20:59:14  BE MADE IT WOULD HAVE AN UNAVOIDABLE IMPACT ON PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY THAT CAN'T BE MITIGATED IN ANY OTHER 
20:59:17 WAY THAN REJECTING THE PROJECT AND REDUCING ITS
20:59:20  SIZE.
AS DISCUSSED IT I PEERS IT
20:59:24  COMPLIES WITH ALL THE APPLICABLE STANDARDS
20:59:28  AND POLICIES AND STAFF DON'T HAVE
20:59:31  ANY PROOF IT
20:59:35  WOULD NECESSITATE DISAPPROVAL.
THE STAFF'S RECOMMENDATION IS TO FIND THE
20:59:38  PROJECT IS EXEMPT FROM THE STANDARDS OF THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL
20:59:42  QUALITY ACT, FURNITURE CEQUA

THAT CONCLUDES
21:00:11  STAFF'S PRESENTATION THIS EVENING, AND I'M NOW
21:00:14  AVAILABLE FOR ANY CLARIFYING QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE.
THANK YOU.

21:00:17 >> THANK YOU, COURTNEY.
COMMISSIONERS, ANY QUESTIONS FOR STAFF
21:00:21  ON THIS
21:00:25  EAT
21:00:29 .
BEN YEE, I RECOGNIZE YOU.

21:00:33 >> Commissioner Yee: LET ME UNMUTE
21:00:37  THIS TEAM
21:00:43 .

21:00:47 IS THIS WAN
21:00:50  HALF MILE?
>> IT IS
21:00:53  SLIGHT OUT.
>> WE TALK ABOUT DENSITY AND THESE ARE FAIRLY LARGE UNITS
21:00:56  AND IT WOULD BE NICE TO INCREASE THE
21:01:00  DENSITY, IT IS LIKE WHAT CHAIR DAULTON WAS SAYING WITH ONE OF THE OTHER
21:01:03  AGENDA ITEMS, HOW
21:01:07  TO MITIGATE SOME OF THOSE HOUSEDOG IMAGINED AND NEEDS SO
21:01:10  IT IS OUT THE TOD.
>> IT IS OUTSIDE THE
21:01:13  TOD.
WHAT I WOULD ADD IS THE APPLICANT THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS HAS LOOKED
21:01:16  AT A NUMBER OF CONFIGURATIONS FOR THE
21:01:19  UNITS INCLUDING A MUCH DENSER PROJECT AT THE
21:01:23  ORIGINAL PROPOSAL BUT THE
21:01:27  ENVIRONMENTAL CON
21:01:34 , THAT'S CONSTRAINED FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PURPOSES.
>> THANK
21:01:37  YOU.
>> THEY OTHER COMMISSIONERS HAVE QUESTIONS ON
21:01:41  THIS ITEM?

21:01:45 COURTNEY, I WOULD ASK
21:01:50  WHAT, ARE THERE
21:01:54  DEEDED CONSTRAINT THAN CORRIDOR?
CAN YOU TELL ME A LITTLE BIT
21:01:57  ABOUT THAT.
>> YEAH, SO RECURRING QUARTER ITSELF IS
21:02:00  PROTECTED AS PART OF A WATER COURSE
21:02:04  EASEMENT OF THE.
>> Commissioner Zhang: 
21:02:08  OF
21:02:11  ALAMEDA COUNTY FLOOD CROAT DISTRICT.
IN ADDITION TO THAT, THERE IS ALSO
21:02:15  THE 20-FOOT CREEK SET BACK WHICH IS NOT A DEED REDSTREAKS AND IS
21:02:18  NOT PROPOSED TO BECOME A DEEDED RESTRICTION BUT WHICH WOULD BE
21:02:21  AN ADDITIONAL DEVELOPMENT CONSTRAINT
21:02:24  ESSENTIALLY IMPOSED ON THE PROJECT.
THE
21:02:27  MUNICIPAL CODE TO LIMIT THE POTENTIAL IMPACTS ON
21:02:31  DEVELOPMENT ON THE
21:02:34  CREEK.
>> Chairman Daulton: IS
21:02:38  THERE SECURITY FENCING BETWEEN THE PEDESTRIAN
21:02:41  WALKWAY BEHIND THE HOUSING AND THE SET BACK?
>>
21:02:45  NO, THERE NO PROPOSED FENCING.
IN
21:02:52  FACT,
21:02:59  ANIMALS MIGHT USE THAT AREA AS THE PEDESTRIAN
21:03:03  CORRIDOR THEMSELVES SO FENCING WAS NOT ALLOWED IN THAT AREA
21:03:06  FOR THAT REASON.
>> OKAY.
ANY OTHER CLARIFYING QUESTIONS?

21:03:11 WE DO HAVE -- OH, CHARLES,
21:03:14  PLEASE.
COMMISSIONER LIU.
>> Commissioner Liu: I HAVE A QUESTION 
21:03:17 FOR THE PLANNER, COURTNEY.
I NOTICED THERE IS A COUPLE OF
21:03:21  HOUSES TO THE WEST OF THE PROPOSED
21:03:24  JOB SITE AND
21:03:28  SO
21:03:31  AND YOU ALSO SAID THIS IS COMMERCIAL ZONING.
WHAT WAS IT BEFORE
21:03:34  AND IF IT IS COMMERCIAL RIGHT NOW
21:03:37  AND WE'RE CHANGING INTO A
21:03:42  MIXESED COMMERCIAL -- WE'RE CHANGING INTO A
21:03:45  MIXED ZONING
21:03:48  WITH RESIDENTIAL UNITS
21:03:51  HERE.
SO, I THINK
21:03:55  IT WAS COMMERCIAL ONLY, NOW WE'RE CHANGING INTO MIXED,
21:03:58  RIGHT?
THAT'S THE PROPOSAL HERE.
>> JUST TO BE
21:04:01  CLEAR THERE'S NO ZONING CHECK PROPOSALS
21:04:04  UNDER CONSIDERATION TONIGHT.
THE ZONING OF THE SEAT IS CURRENTLY
21:04:07  COMMERCIAL OFFICE, AND IT WILL REMAIN COMMERCIAL OFFICE
21:04:10  AFTER THE PROPOSED PROJECT UNDER THE
21:04:13  PROPOSED PROJECT.
THE COMMERCIAL
21:04:17  OFFICE ZONE ALLOWS MIXED USE WITH A CONDITIONAL USE
21:04:21  PERMIT SO THE ITEM UNDER CONSIDERATION WOULD BE THAT CONDITIONAL USE
21:04:24  PERMIT TO AUTHORIZE MIXED USE.
THE CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT
21:04:28  ESSENTIALLY REQUIRES CERTAIN FINDINGS THE
21:04:31  COMMISSION MUST MAKE REGARDING THE SUITABILITY OF A
21:04:34  MIXED USE PROJECT IN THIS AREA.
WHILE I MENTIONED
21:04:37  THE AREA DOES HAVE SOME
21:04:43  MIXED USE NEIGHBORHOOD THERE IS THE HOTEL ACROSS THE STREET TWO BUILDINGS DOWN
21:04:46  THERE IS THE SUNRISE VILLAGE SHELTER, THAT
21:04:49  IS RESIDENTIAL IN NATURE THERE ARE A NUMBER
21:04:54  OF OTHER DAY CARE USE IN THE VICINITY SO IT IS A NEIGHBORHOOD SEES
21:04:57  AN APPROPRIATE MENTION OF USES IN STAFF
21:05:01  USES SO THAT'S WHY STAFF IS RECOMMENDING THAT COMMISSION MAKE
21:05:04  THE FINDINGS REQUIRED TO APPROVE THE CONDITIONAL USE
21:05:07  PERMIT.
BUT THERE IS NO CHANGE ZONE CONSIDERED
21:05:10  TONIGHT.
>> OKAY.
THANK YOU.

21:05:13 >> I WANT TO CLARIFY ONE THING OR ADD TO ONE THING THAT COURTNEY
21:05:16  SAID AND THAT IS THE
21:05:19  PERMIT FOR YOU IS A CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT.

21:05:22 CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT IS AN OLDER
21:05:27  REQUIREMENT FOR A COMMERCIAL MIXED USE PROJECT OF THIS
21:05:31  TYPE.
BACK WHEN THERE WAS AN
21:05:34  OBJECTIVE COMPLIANCE BY RATE FOR PROJECTS LIKE THIS, WE
21:05:38  HADIYA PENDLETONED TO USE A USE PERMIT FOR
21:05:41  SEATS UNDER TWO ACRES AND PLANNED FOR SITES OVER TWO
21:05:45  ACRES.
NOW UNDER OUR CODE AND UNDER STATE LAW, A
21:05:48  RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT, MORE THAN TWO-THIRDS
21:05:52  RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT SUCH AS THIS IS REQUIRED TO BE ALLOWED
21:05:55  IF IT MEETS OBJECTIVE STANDARDS
21:06:00  IN OUR CODE.
WHEEL THE TOOL IS A USE PERMIT, THE COMPLIANCE OF THAT USE PERMIT NEEDS TO 
21:06:04 BE BASED ON OBJECTIVE STANDARDS IS IS AN OPPORTUNITY
21:06:07  FOR THE COMMISSION TO DECIDE THAT MIXED USE WOULD NOT BE
21:06:11  APPROPRIATE FOR ANY GIVEN LOCATION.
>>
21:06:16  OKAY.
THANK YOU.

21:06:19 COMMISSIONER YEE.
>> Commissioner Yee: YES, I HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION FOR COURTNEY.

21:06:23 FOR THAT AERIAL PHOTOGRAPHER GRAPH I
21:06:26  NOTICED ON THE TWO ON THE SLIDES IS ALL OF THOSE CARS
21:06:29  PARKED ALONG THAT, THE FRONTAGE OF THAT PROPERTY.
I
21:06:32  KNOW WHERE MANY OF THOSE CARS ARE COMING FROM.
I GUESS
21:06:36  MY CONCERN IS, THIS PICK UP AND
21:06:39  DROP OFF FOR THAT PRESCHOOL, WILL
21:06:42  THAT FRONTAGE ROAD, WILL THAT BE STILL PUBLIC OR IS
21:06:45  THAT GOING TO BE PRIVATE FOR THE USE OF THE
21:06:48  PRESCHOOL?
BECAUSE, AS YOU CAN SEE IN THAT PICTURE THERE'S QUITE A FEW
21:06:52  CARS THAT GO ALL THE WAY UP AND DOWN THAT WHOLE PROPERTY
21:06:55  AND EVEN FURTHER.
>> SO THERE'S
21:06:58  NO PROPOSED CHANGES NECESSARILY TO STREET
21:07:02  PARKING ALONG BROWN ROAD.
STREET PARKING ALONG BROWN ROAD
21:07:05  RIGHT NOW IS NOT STRIPED IT WILL CONTINUE TO BE
21:07:09  UNSTRIPED STREET FRONTAGE PARKING AFTER THE PROPOSED
21:07:13  DEVELOPMENT PROJECT.
THAT PARKING WOULD BE OPEN TO THE
21:07:16  PUBLIC AS IT IS RIGHT NOW WITH THE OBVIOUS
21:07:19  CONCESSION THERE WOULD HOW TO AND FEW DRIVEWAYS
21:07:22  THERE TO SLIGHTLY REDUCE STREET PARK BUG ALL PICK UP AND DROP OFF
21:07:26  OPERATIONS FOR THE PRESCHOOL WOULD BE REQUIRED FOR
21:07:29  CONDITIONS OF APPROVAL WITHIN THE PRIVATE PARKING
21:07:32  LOT.
IT COULD NOT INTERFERE WITH THE PUBLIC RIGHT OF WAY AT ALL.

21:07:35 SO THERE WOULD NOT BE ANY ANTICIPATED IMPACTS
21:07:38  OF PICK UP AND DROP OF ON THE AVAILABILITY OF THE STRAIGHT
21:07:40  PARKING SPACES.
>> OKAY.
THANK YOU.

21:07:51 >> Chairman Daulton: ANY OTHER CLARIFYING QUESTIONS
21:07:55  FOR STAFF?
LET'S SEE COME TO WE
21:07:59  HAVE THE APPLICANT HERE?
>> YES.

21:08:02 I'M HERE.
>> ALL RIGHT, I WOULD GIVE YOU 10 MINUTES TO GIVE
21:08:05  YOUR PRESENTATION
21:08:14 .
>> I WOULD LIKE TO START WITH A THANK YOU,
21:08:17  MEMBERS OF THE COMMISSION, FOR HAVING THIS PROJECT
21:08:20  ON TODAY'S AGENDA TOMORROW START, WITH
21:08:23  I WANT TO THANK COURTNEY POWELL, THE
21:08:26  PLANNER ON THE PROJECT, FOR
21:08:30  DILIGENTLY WORKING WITH THE ARCHITECT, CIVIL
21:08:33  ENGINEER, FOR THE LAST TWO AND A HALF
21:08:37  YEARS.
AND THERE WAS A LOT OF DISCUSSIONS,
21:08:40  A LOT OF GOING BACK AND
21:08:43  FORTH.
A LOT OF PATIENCE AND,
21:08:48  YOU KNOW, SHE GOT US
21:08:51  HERE TO THIS POINT.
IT IS VERY
21:08:54  MUCH APPRECIATED, AND THE
21:08:57  WHOLE PLANNING DEPARTMENT WORKED
21:09:01  DILIGENTLY WITH OUR ARCHITECT'S
21:09:04  TEAM.
WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE
21:09:07  THEIR WORK ON THIS.

21:09:12 I WANT TO REEMPHASIZE WHAT COURTNEY
21:09:16  HAD JUST MENTIONED
21:09:23 .
IT RUNS EAST TO WEST ON
21:09:26  THE SOUTHERN BORDER OF THE SITE MADE IT VERY CHALLENGING
21:09:29  FOR ANY DESIGN,
21:09:33  AND THE WAY
21:09:42  WE DESIGNED THE COMMERCIAL UNITS AND PRESCHOOL.
THE SET
21:09:46  BACKS, WE KNEW THERE WOULD BE SOME SET BACKS BUT WHAT WE
21:09:49  WEREN'T AWARE
21:09:53  BEFORE
21:09:56  THIS SET BACK IS DIFFERENT FROM OTHER SET BACK WHICH IS IS
21:10:00  TYPICALLY REQUIRED IN ALL THE PROJECTS IN OTHER
21:10:04  PROJECTS WE CAN PUT UP PARKING
21:10:08  STALLS, WE CAN PUT STORM WATER
21:10:12  TREATMENT, WE CAN CONSIDER THE SET BACKS AS A
21:10:15  LANDSCAPE AREA AND ALL
21:10:19  THAT.
THIS SET BACK FOR
21:10:22  THIS CREEK WILL NOT COUNT TOWARDS
21:10:26  ANY OF THOSE.

21:10:29 SO THAT MAKES IT VERY HARD TO DESIGN
21:10:32  THE REST OF THE THINGS
21:10:37  AND THEN STILL, YOU
21:10:41  KNOW, BENEFICIAL TO EVERYBODY
21:10:45   INVOLVED.

21:10:48 SO, THAT WAS OUR BIGGEST CHALLENGE THAT WE
21:10:52  FACED DURING THE WHOLE DESIGN.
WE
21:10:55  DID, AS COURTNEY MENTIONED, WE DID SEVERAL
21:10:59  LAYOUTS TO TRY IT
21:11:02  OUT TO SEE, TO
21:11:07  HAVE MOD UNITS TO ACCOMMODATE
21:11:10  MOD UNITS IN AFFORDABLE UNITS BY
21:11:13  DESIGN.
IT WASN'T WORKING OUT.
AND
21:11:17  IT WAS COUNTER PRODUCTIVE TO PROVIDE
21:11:20  MOD UNITS, THEN WE HAD TO PROVIDE MORE
21:11:24  PARKING, MORE COMMON AREA, IN
21:11:27  TERMS OF PROVIDING ADDITIONAL
21:11:33  SPACES FOR
21:11:36 , COMMON USES FOR THE UNGETS,
21:11:39  ADA REQUARTERMENTS.
SO WE
21:11:44  DETERMINED THAT
21:11:49  PAYING THE FEE FOR AFFORDABLE UNITS IS THE BEST
21:11:53  POSSIBLE SCENARIO TO MAKE THIS PROJECT
21:11:57  VIABLE.

21:12:05 THE CITY CAN INVEST THAT MONEY ELSEWHERE, WHERE AFFORDABLE
21:12:08  UNITS CAN BE ACCOMMODAT
21:12:11 ED WITHOUT THIS
21:12:14  MUCH CHALLENGE
21:12:25 .
WE HAVE 5300 SQUARE FOOT OF COMMERCIAL BUILDING,
21:12:28  WHICH IS PRESCHOOL FOR NOW BUT IN THE FUTURE IT MIGHT BE
21:12:32  CONVERTED TO OTHER USERS.

21:12:40 THIS IS OPERATIONAL AND THE WHOLE DEVELOPMENT
21:12:43  WILL CREATE ANOTHER
21:12:47  CONSTRUCTION JOBS, 40 TO 50 DIRECT
21:12:50  AND INDIRECT JOBS.

21:12:55 I BELIEVE THIS DEVELOPMENT WITH A CONTRIBUTE TO CITY'S
21:12:58  GOAL OF BECOMING MORE
21:13:02  STATISTICALLY OPEN, AND IT WILL DEFINITELY ADD VALUE TO
21:13:05  THE INNOVATION DIRECT, WHICH IS -- WHICH
21:13:10  BORDERS THIS
21:13:14  DEVELOPMENT.
SO, WITH
21:13:18  THAT, I WOULD -- THAT'S ALL I HAVE.

21:13:22 >> ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU FOR THAT
21:13:25  PRESENTATION.
AT
21:13:28  THIS POINT, I WOULD LIKE TO GO TO
21:13:32  PUBLIC COMMENT ON THIS EAT.
TRISH, IF WE
21:13:35  HAVE ANY.
>> YES, CHAIR DAULTON, WE DO HAVE
21:13:38  TWO HANDS RAISED SO I'LL INTRODUCE THE
21:13:42  SPEAKERS.
KELLY A, GO AHEAD AND SPEAK.
YOU NOW HAVE
21:13:46  PERMISSION.
>> THANK YOU.
YEAH, YOU NOTICE HOW ON THIS
21:13:50  STREET, UNLIKE THOSE BRAND NEW STREETS THAT YOU JUST NOW
21:13:53  WIDENED AND BELT OVER THERE AT PACIFIC COMMONS THERE'S
21:13:57  CURB PARKING EVERYWHERE UP AND DOWN THE ROAD.

21:14:00 WHAT WAS THE FIRST REACTIONS OF THE CITY
21:14:03  OFFICIALS AND COMMISSIONERS?
OH, WHAT CAN WE
21:14:07  DO TO ELIMINATE THAT WHY IS THAT.
WELL, MAYBE
21:14:10  IT IS NEEDED.
I DON'T KNOW.
AND, I THINK
21:14:13  THAT WE NEED TO, FIRST OF
21:14:16  ALL, NOTICE YOU'RE BUILDING LIKE A PRESCHOOL OR
21:14:20  AN EDUCATIONAL CENTER FOR YOUNG CHILDREN HERE AND THIS
21:14:23  CITY HAS A HABIT OF DENIGRATING AND
21:14:32  AND DEPRICATING THAT
21:14:35  USAGE GOOD MORNING TO GOOGLE AND
21:14:38  LOOK AROUND.
A COMPASS
21:14:43  ACADEMY AND GENIUS KIDS.
THEN ANOTHER
21:14:46  GENIUS KIDS.
600 FEET EAST ON
21:14:49  THE SAME SEED OF THE CREEK, A
21:14:53  KENANGO AND 1500 FEET EAST A
21:14:57  GOLDEN ACADEMY OF EDUCATION OR SOMETHING.
THIS NEIGHBORHOOD IS A
21:15:00  CENTER OF EDUCATIONAL EXCELLENCE AND I THINK WE NEED TO LEAN
21:15:03  INTO IT AND NOT TRY TO OUTLAW THESE USES.
YOU
21:15:06  KNOW, IT'S A GOOD THING.
NOW, RIGHT BEHIND HERE IS
21:15:10  AN
21:15:13  AGUA CALEENTE CREEK.
YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE IT IS FAMOUS
21:15:16  FOR?
IT RUN THROUGH MISSION PEAK.
AT MISSION
21:15:19  PEAK FORECAST ANYBODY WAS GOING TO BE PUTTING UP A PARKING LOT
21:15:22  OR ANYTHING WITHIN HUNDREDS OF FEET OF THIS CREEK, PEOPLE WOULD BE
21:15:26  SCREAMING ABOUT THE LAND SLIDES AND EVERYTHING ELSE.
HERE YOU ARE
21:15:30  BUILDING RIGHT UP TO WITHIN 20 FEET OF THE BANK AND THERE'S
21:15:34  NO PROBLEM HERE.
SEAMING CREEK, BY THE WAY.

21:15:37 THESE THINGS ARE
21:15:42  HUGE
21:15:47 .
THIS IS MORE VERY EXPENSIVE
21:15:50  HOUSING, TYPICAL FREMONT CONSTRUCTION, HUGE EXPENSE.

21:15:57 >> Chairman Daulton: THANK YOU, KELLY.
TRISH, DO WE
21:16:00  HAVE ANOTHER SPEAKER.
>> YES, WE HAVE TWO MORE HANDS
21:16:04  RAISED.
LET MOO INTRODUCE THE NEXT SPEAKER.

21:16:07 GO AHEAD AND SPEAK.
>> GOOD EVENING,
21:16:13  ANDREAS, FREMONT.
I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE APPLICANT
21:16:16  FOR UP GRADING THE BIKE RACK SPACING TO THE
21:16:19  RECOMMENDED GUIDELINES.
I GUESS I WOULD APPRECIATE SOME CLARIFY
21:16:23  EDUCATION FROM THIS COMMISSION OR FROM
21:16:26  STAFF.
MY INTERPRETATION OF THE LANGUAGE IS IF A MASTER PLAN
21:16:29  HAS BOTH A RECOMMENDED AND A
21:16:32  MINIMAL GUIDANCE, YOU RECOMMENDED IS
21:16:36  THE DEFAULT AND THE MINIMUM IS TO BE
21:16:39  USED WHEN THERE IS A GOOD REASON NOT TO USE INDICT
21:16:42  FAULT SOME IN MY VIEW THE FOUR FEET
21:16:45  SPACING SHOULD HAVE BEEN DEFAULT.
IF THIS
21:16:52  BODY FEELS THAT IT'S THE OTHER WAY AROUND, AND I TYPICALLY SEE A LOT OF CASES, THE BEAK PARKING IS DESIGNED TO
21:16:55  THE MINIMAL STANDARDS, I WOULD LIKE TO -- I
21:16:58  WOULD LIKE FOR YOU TO COME OUT AND ACTUALLY SAY
21:17:01  THAT'S HOW YOU INTERPRET THE LANGUAGE IN THE BIKE MASTER PLAN
21:17:04  OR ANY MASTER PLAN FOR THAT MATTER OF
21:17:08  FACT.
I WILL ALSO FOLLOW UP YOU EARLIER
21:17:13  APPROVED THE MISSION GUIDES BELOW
21:17:16  THE MINIMUM GUISES AND SO I GUESS I HAVE TO
21:17:19  FINAL OUT HOW TO FILE A CODE COMPLAINT WHEN THAT ACTUALLY
21:17:23  GETS BUILT.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
>> Chairman Daulton: THANK
21:17:26  YOU, ANDRAES IS THAT IT,
21:17:30  TRESH?
>> WE HAVE ONE MORE SPEAKER.
KATHERINE,
21:17:33  GO AHEAD AND SPEAK NOW.

21:17:39 >>
21:17:41  HI, CAN YOU HEAR ME?
>> YES.
>> THANK YOU.

21:17:43 THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR EVERYTHING YOU GUYS ARE DOING.
I APPRECIATE IT.

21:17:47 BUT, I DO
21:17:50  HAVE SOME CONFUSION
21:17:53  OVER THE PARK
21:18:04 ING.
IT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE THERE IS A LOT OF ASSIGNED PARKING, IT IS
21:18:07  KIND OF JUST OPEN SO I'M KIND
21:18:10  OF CONCERNED ABOUT,
21:18:13  IS THERE ACTUAL, THEY ACCESS TO PUBLIC
21:18:17  TRANSPORTATION.
IS THERE ANY ACCESS TO ACTUAL
21:18:21  PARKING?
AND BY THE WAY I CAN APPRECIATE OUR TREND
21:18:24  TOWARDS MOVE WALK FROM EXCESS PARKING AND MOVING INTO
21:18:28  BICYCLES, BUT THE REALITY IS, AS MIGRANT OF US STILL
21:18:31  DEPEND ON CARS, SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IS STILL
21:18:36  AVAILABLE.
THANK YOU.
>>
21:18:39  THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
IF THAT IS
21:18:42  THE LAST --
>> ACTUALLY, I'M SORRY, THIS IS
21:18:46  TRISH, YOU DO HAVE ANOTHER SPEAKER.
I'LL GO
21:18:49  AHEAD AND INTRODUCE THE SPEAK SNARY THANK YOU.
>>
21:18:53  ALISA DANCE GO AHEAD AND SPEAK.
>> THANKS.
SORRY
21:18:56  FOR THE LAST-MEN COMMENT.
I WANTED TO
21:18:59  SHARE I FOUND IT RATHER HEART BREAKING TO HEAR THE APPLICANT SAY HE WAS
21:19:03  CONSIDER DOING AFFORDABLE BY DESIGN AND DECIDED AGAINST
21:19:06  IT BECAUSE IT WOULD HAVE REQUIRED INSTALLING SO MUCH MORE
21:19:09  PARKING AND SO MUCH MORE SHARED COMMON SPACE.
SO ME
21:19:12  THIS IS A VERY CLEAR CASE STUDY OF WHY WE
21:19:16  NEED PARK REGULAR FORM IF IT IS LITERALLY BLOCKING FROM
21:19:19  GETTING AFFORDABLE BY DESIGN HOUSING.
THAT DOESN'T SAY ABOUT THIS
21:19:22  PARTICULAR PROJECT BUT SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT POLICY WISE
21:19:26  LONGER TERM.
THANK YOU.

21:19:32 >> Chairman Daulton: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
>> WE DO NOT HAVE ANY MOTHER 
21:19:35 SPEAKERS.
>> THEN I WILL INVITE THE APPLICANT BACK
21:19:38  FOR REBUTTAL, IF HE HAS ANY COMMENTS
21:19:41  OR HIS CLOSING STATEMENT.
>>
21:19:45  I WOULD LIKE TO THANK SOME OF THE
21:19:52  SPEAKERS.
THEY RAISE THE SEAM CONCERNS THAT WE HAD THAT CAME UP
21:19:55  DURING THE DESIGN.

21:19:59 THE PARKING
21:20:03 .
THE PARKING IS -- THE
21:20:06  PARKING AND OTHER DENSITY
21:20:10  AFFORDABLE BY DESIGN UNITS, ALL THESE
21:20:13  QUESTIONS WE, YOU KNOW, DURING THE DESIGN
21:20:17  PHASE, THE LAST TWO AND A HALF
21:20:20  YEARS, WE DID BRAINSTORM A LOT, BUT, YOU KNOW, THESE ARE
21:20:24  ALL THE CONCERNS
21:20:27  DEFINITELY WHICH FREMONT NEED
21:20:30  TO ADDRESS IT IN THE FUTURE.

21:20:36 >> Chairman Daulton: ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU,
21:20:39  SIR.
SO, I WOULD, AT THIS POINT IS FOR FURTHER
21:20:42  QUESTIONS FROM THE COUNCIL.
OR
21:20:45  STAFF.
OR THE APPLICANT, IF NEED
21:20:49  BE.
DO I HAVE ANY?

21:20:54 COMMISSIONER
21:20:58  ZHANG, YES
21:21:07 .
MY SON IS CURRENTLY IN AFTER
21:21:10  AFTER AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAM IN THAT PLAZA AND LITERALLY
21:21:13  WALKS FROM THE PLAZA TO BART STATION, VERY
21:21:17  DOING, PROBABLY 10 MINUTES AND UNFORTUNATELY WE
21:21:21  CANNOT BUILD MORE HOUSES OVER
21:21:25  THERE BECAUSE OF JUST A LITTLE
21:21:28  BIT OF DIFFERENT IN THE DISSTANDS.

21:21:31 YEAH.
THANK YOU.
>> ALL RIGHT, THANK
21:21:34  YOU.
THEY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE
21:21:38  COMMISSION?
OR STAFF OR THE
21:21:41  APPLICANT?
IF THERE
21:21:44  AREN'T ANY, THEN I WOULD ASK THE
21:21:48  PLANNER TO PLEASE ADDRESS SOME OF THE PUBLIC
21:21:53  COMMENTS, ESPECIALLY THE QUESTION REGARDING
21:21:58  IMPLEMENTATION OF THE MASTER PLAN.
YOU COULD
21:22:01  ADDRESS THAT?
>> SURE.
SO
21:22:05  STAFF'S INTER TAKES OF THE BICYCLE PARKING
21:22:08  REQUIREMENTS ARE THAT UNDER STATE LAW WE ARE
21:22:11  PROHIBITED FROM ESSENTIALLY REQUIRING APPLICANTS TO GO
21:22:15  ABOVE AND BEYOND OBJECTIVE MINIMUM STANDARDS
21:22:18  THAT ARE SET IN THE MUNICIPAL CODE SO WE
21:22:21  DO, YOU KNOW, FOR A PROJECT TO BE CONSIDERED
21:22:25  OBJECTIVELY COMPLIANT TO THE GUIDELINES, WE ARE HOLDING THEM TO THE
21:22:28  MINIMUMS SET WITHIN THE BEAK PARKING GUIDANCE AND
21:22:32  APPROVED IN THE BICYCLE PARKING MASTER PLAN.
OBVIOUSLY WHERE THERE
21:22:35  IS ROOM AND IT IS APPROPRIATE, WE ENCOURAGE
21:22:38  APPLICANTS TO GO ABOVE AND BEYOND MEET THE FOUR--FOOT
21:22:41  RECOMMENDED SPACING WHICH THIS APPLICANT HAS AGREED TO DO,
21:22:44  BUT IN, YOU KNOW, THESE CERTAIN SITUATIONS,
21:22:47  OUR ABILITY TO IMPOSE STANDARDS GREATER
21:22:51  THAN MINIMUM ARE HINDERED.
TO RESPOND TO
21:22:54  THE OTHER COMMENT REGARDING THE PARKING, EACH UNIT
21:22:57  DOES HAVE AN ASSIGNED TWO CAR PRIVATE
21:23:00  GARAGE, SO THERE IS ASSIGNED PARKING FOR
21:23:03  EACH UNIT.
THERE IS ALSO UNASSIGNED
21:23:07  GUEST PARKING THAT IS SHARED BETWEEN THE DEVELOPMENT.
THERE
21:23:10  IS MORE GUEST PARKING PROVIDED, SEVEN
21:23:13  SPACES, AS OPPOSED TO WHAT IS REQUIRED, THE
21:23:16  MINIMUM UNDER THE CODE WHICH IS FOUR SPACES.
AND THEN PARKING
21:23:19  FOR THE PRESCHOOL IS, YOU KNOW, AS MOST COMMERCIAL
21:23:22  PARKING IS, LIKE FIRST COME, FIRST SERVED BUT IT WILL BE
21:23:27  DESIGNATED AND' ANSWER ISED FOR THE PRESCHOOL SPECIFICALLY SO THERE IS
21:23:30  NO POTENTIAL CONFLICT WITH THE RESIDENTIAL USE.
I THINK THAT
21:23:33  COVERS ALL OF THE PROJECT-SPECIFIC COMMENTS THAT
21:23:37  WE HEARD TONIGHT.
>> WHAT ABOUT THE AFFORDABLE
21:23:40  BY DESIGN ISSUE?
IS THAT --
21:23:43  THAT CAME DOWN TO LACK OF PARKING?

21:23:50 >> SO THERE WERE A NUMBER OF ISSUES WITH INITIAL SITE
21:23:53  PLAN PROPOSALLED BY THE DEVELOPER.
AS
21:23:56  THE DEVELOPER ALLUDED TO, THE CREEK SET BACK IS
21:23:59  SIGNIFICANT NOT ONLY BECAUSE IT IS A LARGE SET BACK BECAUSE YOU
21:24:03  CANNOT PUT ANY DEEP OF FACILITY WITHIN THAT BOUNDARY.

21:24:07 SO IN INITIAL PROPOSALS
21:24:11  THERE WAS INITIAL ADDITIONAL
21:24:14  DENSITY, AND THEY WERE SMALLER UNITS.
THE ISSUINGS WERE
21:24:18  MOSTLY SPACE CONSTRAINTS RELATIONED TO
21:24:21  CIRCULATION FACILITIES AND PROVISION OF
21:24:24  PARKING FACILITIES FOR A DIFFERENT BUILDING TYPE.

21:24:28 SO HE WOULD DESCRIBE IT PERHAPS ON THIS SEAT AT LEAST AS MORE OF
21:24:31  A RAW NUMBERS GAME IN TERMS OF JUST THE
21:24:35  AMOUNT OF LINEAL FOOTAGE AVAILABLE, BUT CERTAINLY WELL HEARD FROM THE
21:24:38  COMMISSION AND THE PUBLIC, I THINK
21:24:41  IT IS GOOD FEEDBACK ABOUT HOW WE'RE THINKING ABOUT PARKING
21:24:45  IN THESE YEARS THAT ARE APPROXIMATE MEAT TO THE TRANSIT
21:24:48  STATIONS BUT NOT WITHIN THE TOD YEARS SO
21:24:52  CERTAINLY SOMETHING, A BIGGER PICTURE TO CONSIDER.
>> ALL RIGHT, THANK
21:24:55  YOU.
IF THERE ARE NO FURTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE
21:24:58  COMMISSIONERS, LOOKING FOR A MOTION.
>> I
21:25:01  CAN MAKE A MOTION TO APPROVE.
>> Chairman Daulton: WE
21:25:05  HAVE A MOTION TO APPROVE.
CAN I HAVE
21:25:08  A SECOND?
>> I CAN SECOND.
>> I'LL SECOND.

21:25:11 >> THAT'S FINE.

21:26:07 >> THANK YOU, JOEL.
AND SO WE HAVE ONE MORE ITEM ON
21:26:10  THE AGENDA HERE.
AND THAT IS
21:26:14  A CHEVRON CUP.
JOEL, WILL YOU READ THAT
21:26:20  INTRODUCTION?
>> YES, I WILL.
THIS
21:26:23  IS CHEVRON CONDITIONAL USE AMENDMENT AT 2020
21:26:27  DRISCOLL ROAD.
THIS IS AMENDMENT OF CONDITIONAL
21:26:30  USE PERMIT U9734 WITH

21:27:07  AND THEN PUBLIC SPEAKERS AND FIVE MENS IF THEY
21:27:10  NEED A REBUTTAL WITH THAT, I'LL PASS IT TO MARK.
>>
21:27:13  THANK YOU, JOEL.
GOOD EVENING ONCE AGAIN
21:27:16  CHAIR DAULTON AND MEMBERS OF THE PLANNING COMMISSION.
LET ME
21:27:19  PULL UP A PRESENTATION.

21:27:34 OKAY SO THIS IS A REQUEST FOR A CONDITIONAL
21:27:37  USE PERMIT, AS JOEL MENTIONED, RELATED TO
21:27:40  AN ABC LICENSE TYPE UPGRADE AT AN
21:27:44  EXISTING SERVICE STATION CONVENIENT STORE LOCATED
21:27:48  AT 2020 DRISCOLL ROAD.
DURING THIS BRIEF
21:27:51  PRESENTATION, I WILL GO OVER THE BACKGROUND OF THE
21:27:55  SITE, THE DETAILS OF THE PROJECT, PRESENT THE RECOMMENDATION AND
21:27:58  MAKE MYSELF AVAILABLE FOR ANY
21:28:01  RECOMMENDATIONS.
THE PROJECT SITE
21:28:04  IS LOCATED AT THE EASTERN CORNER
21:28:07  OF DRISCOLL
21:28:11  ROAD IT MEASURED A LITTLE OVER A HALF ACHIER IN SIZE AND HAS
21:28:14  OPINION USED AS A SERVICE STATION BASED
21:28:17  BACK TO
21:28:25  1960.
IN 1965, THEY WERE APPROVED TO
21:28:28  ADD TO THE SEAT AND THE FOLLOWING YEAR
21:28:36  U-97-4, A REQUEST FOR THE CONVENIENCE FOR TO SELL BEER AND WINE FOR OFF-SEAT
21:28:39  CONSUMPTION.
THE PROPOSAL BEFORE YOU THIS EVENING IS A REQUEST TO
21:28:42  AMEND THAT 1996 USE PERMIT TO ALLOW FOR THE
21:28:45  ADDITIONAL SALES OF DISSTILLED SPIRITS FROM THE STORE COVERED
21:28:49  UNDER A TYPE 21ABC LICENSE.
PER PLANS
21:28:52  AND THE STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS FILED WITH THE APPLICATION,
21:28:55  DISTILLED SPIRITS WOULD BE LIBERTIED TO BEHIND THE
21:28:58  COUNTER CABINET THAT MEASURED 80 SQUARE FEET
21:29:02  IN SIZE THAT CABINET WOULD
21:29:05  LOCKED AND ACCESSIBLE ONLY BY STORE
21:29:09  EMPLOYEES.
THES PROPOSED HOURS OF DISSTILLED
21:29:12  SPIRIT SALES WOULD BE THE SAME AS BEER AND WINE, 6:00 A.M.
21:29:15  TO 2:00 A.M.DALELY AND THE REQUEST HAS BEEN VETTED BY THE POLICE
21:29:18  DEPARTMENT AND THEY HAVE RAISE NOD OBJECTIONS TO THE PROPOSED
21:29:21  LICENSE UPGRADE THAT THE LOCATION.
THEY HAVE SHEARED
21:29:24  THAT FOUR SERVICE STATIONS IN FREMONT CLIENT HAVE THE REQUESTED
21:29:28  TYPE 21ABC LICENSE, THEY MENTIONED THAT
21:29:31  TWO OF THOSE LOCATIONS HAVE NO RECENT CALLS
21:29:35  FOR SERVICE HISTORY AND WHALE THE OTHER SEATS
21:29:39  DO HAVE A CALL VOLUME, THE POLICE DEPARTMENT SAYS THE NATURE
21:29:42  OF THE CALLS IS LIKELY UNRELATED TO THE
21:29:45  ALCOHOL SALES.
AS SUCH, THEY ARE COMFORTABLE WITH THIS REQUEST
21:29:48  AS CONDITIONED.
STAFF
21:29:52  RECOMMENDS AN EXISTING FACILITY
21:29:56  CEQA EXEMPTION FOR THE REQUEST SINCE THIS IS AN
21:29:59  INVENTORY CHANGE, AND PROPOSED CONDITIONAL
21:30:02  USE AMENDMENT.
CONDITIONS OF APPROVAL INCLUDE
21:30:07  ADHERENCE TO SECURE MEASURES IDENTIFIED IN STATEMENT OF
21:30:10  OPERATIONS AND IDENTIFIED BY ABC,
21:30:14  INCLUDING EMPLOYEE TRAINING.
THAT CONCLUDES STAFF'S PRESENTATION AND
21:30:17  I'M AVAILABLE FOR ANY QUESTIONS.
ALSO, AS WE WILL HAVE
21:30:20  MENTIONED, THE APPLICANT IS HERE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS, AS
21:30:23  WELL.
>> THANK YOU, MARK.

21:30:27 COMMISSIONERS, TO HAVE YOU ANY QUESTIONS FOR STAFF ON THIS EAT?
BEN
21:30:30  YEE, I SEE YOUR HAND.

21:30:33 >> Commissioner Yee: THERE WE.
IF YEAH, I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE WHEN YOU,
21:30:37  MARK, WHEN YOU SPOKE WITH OUR FREMONT
21:30:40  PD, THAT IS THE MOST LATEST AND UP-TO-DATE IN
21:30:43  TERMS OF INFORMATION THAT THEY HAVE IN REGARDS TO ANY ISSUES THAT
21:30:46  ME HAVE OCCURRED WITH WHETHER IT IS AT
21:30:50  THIS GAS STATION OR THEY OTHER LOCATION, THAT'S A SERVICE
21:30:53  STATION WITH A TYPE 21 LECKER LICENSE.
>> THAT IS
21:30:56  CORRECT SO EARLIER THIS WEEK, WE REACHED OUT TO
21:31:00  CAPTAIN NELSON TO GET UPDATED INFORMATION
21:31:03  AND WE WERE PROVIDED WITH THE STATISTICS THAT
21:31:06  I INCLUDED IN MY
21:31:09  PRESENTATION
21:31:12 .
>> Commissioner Yee: ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU.

21:31:15 >> Chairman Daulton: ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS FOR STAFF?
AT THIS
21:31:18  TIME, I GUESS WE CAN TAKE A PRESENTATION BY THE
21:31:21  APPLICANT, IF THEY HAVE ONE.

21:31:25 IS THAT --
>> GOOD EVENING.
I'M STEVE
21:31:30  RAWLINGS, HERE ON BEHALF OF CHEVRON.
I DID WANT TO COME FORWARD
21:31:33  AND FOR THE RECORD SAY THAT WE DO AGREE TO ALL OF THE DRAFT
21:31:36  CONDITIONS OF APPROVAL THIS EVENING.

21:31:39 ALSO, WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW THAT JOINING ME HERE
21:31:42  THIS EVENING ARE SIX REPRESENTATIVES FROM CHEVRON CORPORATION THAT ARE
21:31:46  INVOLVED IN OPERATIONS AND MERCHANDISING, AND IF
21:31:49  ANYBODY HAS THEY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS, I THINK THAT WE COULD
21:31:52  PROBABLY PROVIDE YOU ANSWERS TO THAT SO WITH
21:31:55  THAT, THAT CONCLUDE MICE COMMENTS.

21:32:00 SMALL ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU VERY
21:32:03  MUCH, SIR.
COMMISSIONERS, ANY QUESTIONS FOR
21:32:06  THE
21:32:09  APPLICANT?
COMMISSIONER
21:32:13  YEAH.
>> YES,
21:32:16  I WANT TO DOUBLY CHECK, STEVE, YOU HEARD ME
21:32:19  PROBABLY EARLIER I SAID SISTER SITE.
YOU HAVE ANOTHER
21:32:22  CHEVRON THAT I THINK IS OWN BID SAME GROUP
21:32:26  OF PEOPLE AT 5300MOWRY.
>> YES,
21:32:30  SIR, COMMISSIONER YEE.
BOTH STORES ON MOWRY AND
21:32:34  DRISCOLL ARE ACTUALLY CORPORATE OWNED STORES SO THEY ARE OWNED BY
21:32:37  CHEVRON STATIONS INC. THEM CURRENTLY OWN
21:32:40  297, MAYBE 300 STORES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT THEY
21:32:45  OPERATE.
>> Commissioner Yee: OKAY, THAT'S WHAT I WANTED TO
21:32:49  VERIFY.
THAT'S WHAT I WAS TOLD AND I WANTED TO
21:32:52  MAKE SURE FROM THE CORPORATE STAND POINT, EVERYTHING
21:32:55  JIBES.
THEY OWN THAT, THE
21:32:58  350MOWRY LOCATIONS HAS THE TYPE 21
21:33:02  LIQUOR LICENSE I THINK SINCE 2018?
>> NO, I THINK IT WAS
21:33:05  MUCH MORE RECENT THAN THAT.
I BELIEVE WAS SOME TIME STARTED
21:33:10  IN 2021.
>> Commissioner Yee: OKAY, SO 2021.

21:33:14 OKAY.
AT LEAST WHAT I SAW WAS IT WAS IN GOOD STANDING WHICH IS GOOD
21:33:17  TO SEE.
WHEN HE LOOKED AT THE
21:33:21  ABC DATABASE.
OKAY.
THEN
21:33:24  THERE HASN'T BEEN ANY REPORTED INCIDENTS WHAT SO
21:33:27  EVER THAT'S WHAT I WAS TOLD BY THE
21:33:30  STORE MANAGER THERE.
AND THEN, I GUESS THE NEXT
21:33:34  QUESTION, I'M JUST WONDERING, THEY COULDN'T ANSWER FOR ME IS
21:33:37  LIKE, DO YOU ROUGHLY HAVE AN IDEA WHAT THE PERCENTAGE OF
21:33:40  YOUR TOTAL SALES WOULD BE RELATED TO THE SPIRITS?

21:33:45 >> YOU KNOW, THE ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES,
21:33:48  BEER AND WINE, BEER IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE
21:33:51  PREDOMINANTLY OUR LEADING SALES, AND IT IS GOING TO
21:33:54  REPRESENT SOME PLACE BETWEEN 3-5% I BELIEVE OF YOUR
21:33:57  SALES.
THE DISTILLED SPIRITS WILL ADD AN
21:34:01  ADDITIONAL PERCENTAGE POINT OF TWO TO
21:34:04  THOSE TECH SALES AND THAT'S NOT BECAUSE OF VOLUME, IT IS BECAUSE
21:34:07  THOSE PRODUCTS ARE MORE EXPENSIVE
21:34:11  THAN THE BEER PRODUCTS.
>> OKAY.

21:34:14 GREAT.
THAT PRETTY MUCH
21:34:17  SUBSTANTIATE WHAT IS HEARD AS WELL WHEN I WAS OUT THERE TALKING TO
21:34:21  THE TWO DIFFERENT STORE MANAGERS, FOR TWO CORPORATE
21:34:24  LOCATIONS.
THANK YOU.
>> CERTAINLY.

21:34:32 
>> Chairman Daulton: ALL RIGHT, THEY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMISSION?

21:34:35 IF NOT, I WOULD ASK FOR -- DO WE HAVE ANY
21:34:38  PUBLIC COMMENT, TRISH.
>> YES, WE
21:34:42  DO HAVE ONE RAISED HAND, I'LL INTRODUCE THE
21:34:45  SPEAKER RIGHT NOW.
>> THANK YOU.
>> KELLY GOING
21:34:48  AHEAD AND SPEAK.

21:35:04 >> I HAVE FOR OBJECTION TO SELLING BEER OUT OF THIS LOCATION.
THE CRIME RATE
21:35:07  IS PRETTY LOW, NO MATTER HOW YOU SLICE IT.
I
21:35:10  WANT TO POINT OUT, IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT
21:35:14  THE SEAM BLOCKING ON THE SAME BLOCK, 3 HUNKER 400
21:35:17  FEET, SOMETIMES 200 FEET, THERE IS A
21:35:21  SCHOOL, THERE IS A GREEN FOREST ART SCHOOL, A
21:35:24  STEMLAND, MELODY ACADEMY OF
21:35:27  MUSIC, GIRAFFE MUSIC CENTER AND EASTERN CHINESE
21:35:30  SCHOOL AND ALL OF THESE ARE THE KIND OF USES THAT
21:35:34  THIS CITY FROWNS UPON, BUT
21:35:38  THEY'RE EVERYWHERE BUT THEY'RE IN HIGH DEMAND
21:35:41  AND VERY MUCH UNITED.
AND THERE IS THIS EMPTY
21:35:44  SHELL OF A BUILDING AS
21:35:47  RECENTLY AS 2008 WAS A TACO BELL.
TACO BELL
21:35:51  PROVIDES FOOD TO PEOPLE.
SELLS FAST FOOD BUT IT
21:35:54  IS SOME KIND OF FOOD, AND 2,000 FEET AWAY THERE
21:35:57  IS A HOPKINS JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL FULL OF HUNGRY TEENAGERS
21:36:00  THAT USED TO BE ABLE TO WALK TO TACO BELL
21:36:04  AND GET THEIR CHALUPAS OR WHATEVER THEY EAT
21:36:07  AT THE TACO BELLS, OR TACOS,
21:36:10  I GUESS WATCH CAN WE DO?
WHAT IS THE CITY DOING?
THERE
21:36:13  IS THESE ABANDONED COMMERCIAL THINGS EVERYWHERE IN
21:36:16  FREMONT, LIKE THIS ABANDONED TACO BELL.
MAYBE WE CAN PUT
21:36:20  IN A LEARNING CENTER THERE OR FINAL ANOTHER FAST FOOD OR
21:36:23  SOMETHING TO GET THESE CHILDREN EITHER FED OR
21:36:26  MAYBE EDUCATED.
AND NOT HAVE
21:36:30  THESE UGLY COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS EVERYWHERE AND BUILD
21:36:33  MORE COMMERCIAL SPACE EVERYWHERE THAT'S UNNEEDED
21:36:36  UNLESS YOU PUT IN MORE OF THESE LEARNING
21:36:39  CENTERS, WHICH OBVIOUSLY ARE IN GREAT DEMAND BECAUSE THEY'RE
21:36:42  EVERYWHERE AND THEY'RE VERY MUCH NEEDED.
YEAH, WHAT'S GOING ON
21:36:45  WITH THAT TACO BELL?
THANK YOU.

21:36:49 >> THANK YOU, KELLY.

21:36:54 NOW, IF THE APPLICANT WOULD LIKE TO REBUT THE
21:36:58  PUBLIC COMMENT OR MAKE FINAL CLOSING COMMENTS, THIS IS THE
21:37:01  TIME.
NO COMMENTS?
ALL
21:37:05  RIGHT.

21:37:08  COMMISSION, AND I WOULD ASK
21:37:11  FOR EITHER FURTHER DISCUSSION OR I WILL
21:37:14  DEFINITELY ENTERTAIN A MOTION HERE.
>> I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A
21:37:18  MOTION TO ACCEPT STAFF RECOMMENDATION.

21:37:21 I GUESS BOTH OF US.
>> I'M GOING TO
21:37:24  CALL THAT FOR CRAIG, MADE THE MOTION AND GIVE BEN THE
21:37:27  SECOND THERE SO WE WILL HAVE, CAN I HAVE A ROLL CALL VODE ON THIS?

21:37:34 >> YES, WHEN I CALL YOUR NAME, PLEASE VOTE ON THE MOTION

21:39:02  AFTER WHICH WE WILL BE SENDING THAT TO THE

21:39:08  RESPONDING TO THE COMMENTS WE GET FROM THE PUBLIC.
IF YOU HAVE A

WE HAVE AN OPEN HOUSE NEXT
21:39:15  WEDNESDAY THAT CAN PROVIDE MORE FEEDBACK.
SECONDARILY, THERE
21:39:19  IS A PLANNING COMMISSIONER TRAINING COMING

IF YOU'RE INTERESTED
21:39:29  IN THAT, YOU CAN SIGN UP, PUBLIC IS
21:39:32  FREE OF CHARGE THROUGH ILG AND IT IS A GOOD REFRESHER
21:39:35  OR ADDITIONAL WAY TO BLEND HOW TO BE A COMMISSIONER AND THE
21:39:38  KIND OF THINGS YOU COME ACROSS IN YOUR DAILY
21:39:40  WORK.
THANK YOU.
>> THANK YOU, JOEL.

21:39:43 ANY ANNOUNCEMENTS BY THE COMMISSIONERS?
I HAVE
21:39:46  AN ANNOUNCEMENT OR SOMETHING HE WOULD LIKE TO
21:39:50  ANNOUNCE.
THERE'S SEVERAL, AT LEAST TWO COMMISSIONERS HERE
21:39:54  TONIGHT THAT HAVEN'T BEEN ON THE COMMISSION FOR
21:39:57  LONG, AND SO I WANTED TO REMIND THE
21:40:00  OLD COMMISSIONERS AND TELL THE NEW COMMISSIONERS THAT WE HAVE
21:40:03  ON THE PLANNING COMMISSION A
21:40:07  REFERRAL PROCESS.
AND THAT REFERRAL PROCESS
21:40:10  IS OUTLINED IN THE JULY
21:40:14  25, 2019 MINUTES OF THE PLANNING COMMISSION
21:40:18  MEETING FOR THAT DAY.
SO, IF YOU'RE INTERESTED
21:40:21  IN BRINGING UP
21:40:24  ITEMS TO STAFF TO BE CONSIDERED
21:40:28  FOR VOTING PLAN TO MOVE TO CITY COUNCIL,
21:40:31  TAKE A LOOK AT THAT ITEM.

21:40:38  AGO WE INSTITUTED THAT FACILITY FOR THE
21:40:42  COMMISSIONERS.
IF THERE ANYTHING ELSE, THEN I THINK WE
21:40:46  CAN ADJOURN THIS MEETING.
ANYTHING ELSE?

21:40:49 NO?
THAT'S IT?
ALL RIGHT, I'M CALLING
21:40:52  IT.
THANK YOU ALL.
