19:11:40 , DID SIT IN MY CAR AND LOOK AND
19:11:43  GOT A SENSE OF
THE WIDTH OF THAT.
THAT'S IT.

19:11:48 >> Commissioner Daulton:   COMMISSIONER ZHANG.
19:11:51 
>> Commissioner Zhang:   I WALKED BY THE DECOTO PROPERTY,
19:11:54  VISITED THE OWNER ON THE GAS STATION AND THE RESTAURANT.

19:12:47  ITEM IS CHASE BANK.
JOEL
19:12:50 , SECRETARY PULLEN IF YOU WOULD, READ THE ITEM
19:12:54  AND INTRODUCE STAFF ON THIS.

19:13:00 >> Planner Pullen:   THANK YOU.
THIS IS CHASE BANK
19:13:03 , FIRST ITEM.

19:13:09  46645 Mission Boulevard -AT THE CORNER
19:13:13  OF MISSION BOULEVARD AND WARM SPRINGS.
TO CONSIDER A
19:13:16  Discretionary Design Review Permit and Conditional Use Permit for the development of a new approximately 
19:13:20 4,020 square foot bank branch with a stand
19:13:24  ALONE DRIVE-THROUGH AT
19:13:29 M IN THE WARM
SPRINGS COMMUNITY PLANNING AREA AND
19:13:34  to consider a categorical exemption from the requirements
19:13:37  of the California Environmental QUALITY ACT
19:13:40 , CEQA,
19:13:45  AND FURTHER ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW PURSUANT
19:13:49  TO CEQA
GUIDELINES.
THERE IS A PRESENTATION
19:13:52 , THAT FOLLOWED BY PUBLIC SPEAKERS WITH
19:13:55  TIME GIVEN AT THE CHAIR'S DISCRETION AND THEN
19:13:59  A FIVE MINUTE REBUTTAL TIME FROM THE APPLICANT.
SO
19:14:02  WITHOUT FURTHER ADO, JAMES WILLIS
19:14:05  HAS THE PRESENTATION.

19:14:20 >> GOOD EVENING, COMMISSIONERS.

19:14:26 PROJECT BEFORE THE COMMISSION TONIGHT IS THE CHASE BANK
19:14:29  PROJECT.
THIS SLIDE GIVES A BRIEF INTRODUCTION TO THE TOPICS
19:14:33  THAT WILL BE DISCUSSED IN TONIGHT'S PRESENTATION.
19:14:37 
THE CHASE BANK PROJECT WOULD REQUIRE A DISCRETIONARY
19:14:40  DESIGN REVIEW BECAUSE IT IS A NEW COMMERCIAL BUILDING AND
19:14:43  A CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT, BECAUSE IT INCLUDES A DRIVE-
19:14:46 THROUGH ATM.

19:14:55 PROJECT SITE IS LOCATED AT THE CORNLER
19:14:58  CORNER OF WARM
19:15:01  SPRINGS BOULEVARD AND MISSION BOULEVARD.
THE SITE
19:15:05  IS DESIGNED TOWN
19:15:08  CENTER TRANSITIONAL.
THE SITE IS PART OF THE
19:15:13  WARM SPRINGS SHOPPING CENTER.
A SEPARATE LEGAL LOT
19:15:16  FROM THE REST OF THE SHOPPING CENTER BUT IS OWNED AND MANAGED BY
19:15:20  THE OWNERS OF THE REST OF THE SHOPPING CENTER.
19:15:23 
ACCESS IS SHARED
19:15:26  BY PRIVATE  EASE
19:15:30  EASEMENTS AND AGREEMENTS.
THE SITE IS A
19:15:33  DENNY'S  RESTAURANT.
THE PROJECT WOULD DMOL
19:15:36  DEMOLISH THE EXISTING BUILDING AND REPLACE
19:15:39  IT WITH A NEW 4020
19:15:42  SQUARE FOOT BANK AND A DRIVE THROUGH
19:15:45  IN THE  PASHING LOT.
AS PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED
19:15:49 , THE NEW PROJECT WOULD INCLUDE A FORMULATE
19:15:52  20 SQUARE FOOT BUILDING WHICH WOULD HAVE A F.A.R.
19:15:55  MUCH 0 0
19:15:59  OF 0
19:16:03 .20
19:16:07 .
EXCEEDS THE MINIMUM AMOUNT OF PLANTINGS
19:16:10  REQUIRED, FOR A  DRIVE-THROUGH INTRMS ON THIS SIZE OF
19:16:20  ENTERPRISE ON THIS SIDE OF THE LOT.
FIVE CARS TO STACK
19:16:24  WITHOUT INTERFERING WITH THE PARKING LOT CIRCULATION.
THE
19:16:27  PROPOSED PROJECT WOULD REVAMP THE EXISTING LANDSCAPE BY REPLACING
19:16:31  THE PARKING LOT TREES WITH NEW TREES
19:16:34 .
DURING THE COURSE OF REVIEW, STAFF DETERMINED THAT
19:16:37  TWO EXISTING REDWOOD TREES IDENTIFIED BY RED
19:16:40  ARROWS ON THE PLAN HERE
19:16:43 , COULD BE SAVED THROUGH A MINOR
19:16:47  REDESIGN OF THE PARKING LOT.

19:16:50 THE PROPOSED CONDITION OF APPROVAL WOULD REQUIRE THE APPLICANT
19:16:53  TO WORK WITH STAFF TO SAVE THESE TWO TREES.

19:16:56 THE APPLICANT HAS INDICATED THEIR WILLINGNESS TO WORK WITH
19:17:00  STAFF TO SAVE THESE TREES AND HAS PROVIDED A
19:17:04  PRELIMINARY SKETCH WHICH WOULD RESULT IN A SLIGHT REDUCTION IN THE
19:17:07  NUMBER OF PARKING SPACES.
AROUND THE
19:17:10  PERIMETER OF THE SITE WOULD BE NEW PLANTERS
19:17:13  CONTAINING SHRUBS AND
19:17:16  GROUND COVER.
THE SLOPED AREA AT THE CORNER OF THE
19:17:19  SITE WOULD HAVE ITS TURF REPLACED WITH MORE
19:17:23  WATER SMART GROUND COVER.
AROUND THE WALLS OF
19:17:26  THE BUILDINGS, AROUND THE ENTRANCES
19:17:29  WOULD BE PLANTERS WHICH WOULD HELP TO FURTHER DEFINE
19:17:33  THE ENTRANCES TO THE BUILDING.
THE PROPOSED PROJECT WOULD PROVIDE
19:17:36  NOR PARKING THAN THE MINIMUM REQUIRED.
THE TOTAL NUMBER OF PARKING SPACE
19:17:39 S PROVIDED MAY BE SLIGHTLY REDUC
19:17:42 ED DUE TO THE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED
19:17:45  EFFORT TO SAVE THE TWO REDWOOD TREES.
19:17:48 
BIKE PARKING WOULD CONSIST OF SIX SHORT
19:17:52  TERM BIKE RACKS, TWO LONG TERM
19:17:55  LOCKERS WOULD BE PROVIDED ON THE MISSION SIDE OF
19:17:58  THE BUILDING NEAR THE OTHER BUILDING ENTRANCE
19:18:02  BECAUSE DRIVE THROUGH ENTERPRISE
CANNOT
19:18:05  BE UTILIZED, CITY STAFF ANALYZE
19:18:09 ED OR THE POTENTIAL VMT IMPACTS
19:18:12 .
THE USE BETWEEN THE DENNY'S
19:18:15  RESTAURANT AND THE PROPOSED CHASE BANK
19:18:18 , A COMBINATION OF SHORTER TRIPS AND
19:18:22  TRIP LENGTH WOULD BE REDUCED BY VM
19:18:25 T CURRENT USE.
THE PROPOSED BANK BUILDING WOULD
19:18:28  FEATURE MODERN ARCHITECTURE
19:18:32 , BREAKING UP THE MASSING AND PROVIDING
19:18:35  VISUAL INTEREST.
THE EXTERIOR
19:18:38  MATERIALS WOULD CONSIST OF CHISEL
19:18:42 ED LIMESTONE AND STORE FRONT GLASS.
THE
19:18:46  BUILDING WOULD BE PEDESTRIAN ORIENTED
19:18:49 , IN ADDITION TO THE ENTRANCE FACING THE PARKING LOT.

19:18:53 STAFF RECOMMENDS THE PLANNING COMMISSION FIND THE PROJECT EXEMPT
19:18:57  FROM THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT PER THE CEQA GUIDELINES SPECIFIED IN
19:19:00  THE STAFF REPORT.
FIND THAT THE PROJECT IS
19:19:04  IN CONFORMANCE WITH THE GENERAL PLAN AND
19:19:07  ZONING FOR THE REASONS ENUMERATED IN THE STAFF REPORT
19:19:10  AND APPROVE THE DISCRETIONARY DESIGN REVIEW FOR
19:19:14  A NEW COMMERCIAL BUILDING AND
THE CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT FOR THE NEW DRIVE-
19:19:18 THROUGH ATM.
STAFF IS AVAILABLE TO ANSWER
19:19:21  QUESTIONS REGARDING THIS PROJECT AS IS
19:19:24  THE PROJECT APPLICANT'S DESIGN TEAM.
THANK
19:19:27  YOU.

19:19:36 >> Commissioner Daulton:   THANK YOU.
DO WE HAVE ANY
19:19:40  CLARIFYING QUESTIONS TRT COMMISSION FOR STAFF?

19:19:47  QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMISSION FOR STAFF?
NOBODY?

19:19:50 I HAVE ONE QUESTION IF I COULD, THE FIVE-
19:19:53 CAR STACKING ON THE ATM HOW WAS THAT
19:19:56  DECISION MADE AS TO HOW MANY CARS YOU CAN REASON
19:19:59 ABLY STACK IN THAT ATM
19:20:02  LINE WITHOUT INTERFERING WITH THE CIRCULATION OF
THE PARKING LOT?
19:20:06 
>> ARE YOU ASKING ABOUT HOW WE DETERMINED HOW MANY CARS WOULD BE 
19:20:09 NECESSARY, OR HOW MANY CARS COULD ACTUALLY FIT IN THE SPACE
19:20:12 ?
>> Commissioner Daulton:   HOW MANY SHOULD BE NECESSARY?

19:20:15 >> IT WAS BASED ON INFORMATION PROVIDED BY THE APPLICANT ON THE
19:20:18  AVERAGE USE OF THESE ATM
19:20:21 'S AT ANY ONE TIME.
OUR CITY TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING
19:20:24  STAFF WORKED WITH THEM TO DETERMINE WHAT WAS AN APPROPRIATE NUMBER OF
19:20:28   CAR-STACKING BASED ON HOW MANY CARS
19:20:31  USE THE ATM AT THE PEAK
19:20:34  TIMES AND HOW LONG IT
TAKES TO USE THE ATM
19:20:35 .
>> Commissioner Daulton:   OKAY, THANK YOU.

19:20:39 ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMISSION FOR STAFF
19:20:43 ?
SEEING NONE I WILL GO ON AND ASK IF
19:20:47  THE APPLICANT IS PRESENT, IF THEY'D LIKE TO GIVE A PRESENTATION,
19:20:50  THEY HAVE TEN MINUTES.

19:20:57 I SEE PATRICK O'NEIL RAISING
19:21:00  HIS HAND.
CAN YOU UNMUTE HIM TRISH
19:21:04 ?
>> HI
19:21:08 .
>> Commissioner Daulton:   PLEASE.
>> SHOULD I
19:21:11  GO ON VIDEO?
>> Commissioner Daulton:   PLEASE
19:21:15 .
>> I THANK YOU AND I WANT TO
19:21:18  SAY THANKS TO JAMES AND THE ENTIRE STAFF FOR PUTTING THIS TOGETHER
19:21:21  TONIGHT AND WE'RE JUST HERE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS.
SO
19:21:24  WE'RE EXCITED ABOUT THIS LOCATION AND EXCITED TO BE HERE.
WE HAVE
19:21:28  DAVE AND
19:21:38  ARIANE SANDERS, WE ALSO HAVE RORN CHESTER WHO
19:21:42  IS THE MARKET DIRECTOR OF REAL ESTATE FOR CHASE
19:21:45  BANK AND WE'RE ALL HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS BUT OTHERWISE EXCITE
19:21:50 ED AND WANT TO
SAY THANK YOU.

19:21:54 >> Commissioner Daulton:   COMMISSIONERS DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FOR THE
19:21:57  APPLICANT?
COMMISSIONER ZHANG PLEASE
19:22:02 .
>> Commissioner Zhang:   HOW LONG WILL BE THE CONSTRUCTION TIME
19:22:05  IF APPROVED?
>> APPROXIMATELY SEVEN MONTHS
19:22:09 .
>> Commissioner Zhang:   DO YOU HAVE A PLAN TO LIKE ENSURE THE SURROUND
19:22:12 ING BUSINESS NOT  AFFECTED TOO MUCH?
>> YEAH,
19:22:16  WE WILL REQUIRE A LOGISTICS PLAN
19:22:20  THAT WILL GET RUN THROUGH THE LANDLORD
19:22:23 'S AGENCY AND THEY HAVE A LOCAL OR LIKE A REGIONAL CONTACT
19:22:26  THAT'S OUT HERE THAT REPRESENTS THE PROPERTY OWNERS.
SO
19:22:29  THAT LOGISTICS PLAN WILL GET VETTED
19:22:33  THROUGH THEM AND BY VIRTUE OF THAT IT'S A
19:22:36  TENANT COORDINATION EFFORT.
19:22:40 
>> Commissioner Zhang:   WILL THERE BE LIKE ANY
19:22:43  ENTRANCE TO THE -- WILL BE BLOCKED DURING
19:22:46  THE CONSTRUCTION?
>> NOT THAT I'M AWARE OF, NO.
19:22:49 
BECAUSE AND THE ONLY-I MEAN TEMPORARILY WE'LL HAVE
19:22:52  TO BLOCK THE RIDE IN-RIDE OUT
19:22:56  FROM WARM SPRINGS.
BUT THAT'S ON A VERY LIMIT
19:22:59 ED BASIS AND I'M FAMILIAR WITH THIS SITE, HAVE BEEN FOR
19:23:03  YEARS JUST PASSING THROUGH OBVIOUSLY
19:23:06  MISSION.
AND THERE'S JUST NO WAY THAT'S GOING TO BE SHUT DOWN
19:23:09  FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME.
IT'S TOO WELL UTILIZED
19:23:12 .

19:23:16 >> Commissioner Zhang:   ALL RIGHT THANK YOU.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   CHAIR
19:23:20  RECOGNIZES COMMISSIONER YEE.
>> Commissioner Yee:   YES, LET ME TAKE THAT, OKAY.

19:23:23 AS YOU WELL KNOW THAT THE CURRENT DENNY'S PARKING
19:23:26  LOT IS EVEN THOUGH IT'S SUPPOSED
19:23:29  TO BE EXCLUSIVE USE FOR DENNY'S
19:23:32  IT'S BEING SHARED BY THE BUSINESSES OVER BY STARBUCKS
19:23:36  AND PAIRS  BEGET.
WHEN THIS BANK IS
19:23:39  BUILT WILL THE PARKING LOT BE ONLY EXCLUSIVE USE FOR THE BANK
19:23:43 ING CUSTOMERS OR WILL IT STILL BE SHARED AS
19:23:46  IT IS RIGHT NOW?
19:23:53 
>> I BELIEVE WE HAVE A JOINT ACCESS PARKING AGREEMENT,
19:23:56  AND IT'S ESCAPING ME THE
19:23:59  EXACT TERMS OF THAT RIGHT NOW BUT I WOULD ASK
19:24:03  IF ARIANE HAS
19:24:06  THAT -- ARIANE SANDERS IS ON
19:24:10  MY TEAM AND IF SHE HAS THAT
19:24:13 
INFORMATION AS WELL.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   TRISH COULD 
19:24:16 YOU UNMUTE ARIANE SANDERS PLEASE
19:24:20 .
>> ARIANE GO AHEAD AND SPEAK
19:24:23 .
>> GOOD EVENING THIS IS ARIANE SANDERS AND
19:24:26  I WAS WORKING ON THIS PROJECT.
WITH REGARDS TO THE
19:24:30  SHARED  PARKING, IT IS IN THE AGREEMENT WITH THE
19:24:33  TENANTS ALL AROUND THAT IT IS SOMEWHAT
19:24:36  SHARED.
SO I WOULD ASSUME THAT THERE WILL
19:24:41  BE OPPORTUNITIES THAT STARBUCKS CAN
19:24:44  PARK ON IT OR
19:24:48  WILL SOON BE PARKING ON IT FOR  LIMITED
19:24:51  TIMES.

19:24:54 >> Commissioner Yee:   OKAY, I
19:24:58  GUESS WE CAN MAKE SURE THERE IS SOMETHING THAT TALKS
19:25:01  ABOUT SHARED PARKING AGREEMENT?

19:25:06 >> Commissioner Daulton:   TRADITION COULD YOU UNMUTE
19:25:10  DAVID LUNDY PLEASE?
>> 
19:25:13 YES, ONE MOMENT.
DAVID GO AHEAD AND SPEAK.
19:25:17 
>> GOOD EVENING, THIS IS DAVE LUNDY
19:25:20  ON PATRICK AND ARIANE
19:25:23 'S GROUP AS WELL.
I BELIEVE THERE IS A PARKING AGREEMENT FOR
19:25:27  THE ENTIRE ASSEMBLY.
THERE WAS
19:25:30  A QUESTION WHETHER WE WERE GOING TO HAVE TO PARK OUR SITE
19:25:33  INDIVIDUALLY OR PARK FOR THE ENTIRE CENTER.
AND THERE IS AN
19:25:37  AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE OWNERS BUT IT IS NOT APPROVED BY THE CITY
19:25:39 .
>> Commissioner Yee:   OKAY, THANK YOU.

19:25:42 AND THEN I HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION TOO AS WELL
19:25:45 .
AND I WONDERED IF YOU CAN
19:25:49  GIVE ME CLARITY ON THIS TOO.
BECAUSE I SAW ON YOUR PLANS
19:25:52  THAT THERE'S FOUR PARKING SPACES THAT ARE FACING THE
19:25:55  STARBUCKS SIDE THAT WILL BE ELIMINATED.
AND THEN THERE'S 14
19:25:58  MORE PARKING SPACES THAT FACE
19:26:02  THE CARL
19:26:05 'S JR. SIDE.
FROM WHAT I WAS TOLD BY
19:26:08  THE  DENLY'S OWNER THOSE FOUR PARK
19:26:11 ING SPACES ACTUALLY BELONG TO THE CENTER.
AND AS I
19:26:14  WAS TALKING TO THE MANAGER
19:26:18  FOR CARL'S JR,
19:26:21  THEY ARE ACTUALLY ON THE CARL
19:26:25 'S JR. SIDE THAT IS ON THE NORTH SIDE OF THAT LIGHT
19:26:28  POLE AND THEN GOING TO THE SOUTH SIDE IS THE DEN
19:26:32  DENNY'S SIDE.
CAN YOU GIVE ME SOME CLARITY
19:26:35  ON THAT?
IT LOOKS LIKE ON THOSE PLANS YOU ARE TAKING OUT THE
19:26:39  14 BY CARL'S JUNIOR AND
19:26:42  THE FOUR BY  STARBUCKS.
I'M NOT SURE IF YOU
19:26:45  HAVE THE RIGHTS TO DO THAT.
CAN YOU CLARIFY THAT FOR ME PLEASE
19:26:48 ?

19:26:55 >> IS THERE A WAY THAT WE CAN IDENTIFY THE SPACES IN QUESTION ON
19:26:58  THE ZOOM?

19:27:03 >> Planner Pullen:   JAMES CAN SHARE THE SITE PLAN AND GIVE
19:27:06  HIM A MOMENT.
I'M NOT SURE IF HE HAS THAT PARTICULAR
19:27:10  ONE IN HIS PRESENTATION OR IF YOU HAVE TO PUT IT UP
19:27:13  SEPARATELY.
>> I APPRECIATE IT.
AND
19:27:16  I'M CERTAINLY NOT AWARE OF ANY -- OF ANY PART OF OUR
19:27:19  SITE PLAN THAT CROSSES OVER THE PARCEL LINES
19:27:22  FOR THIS PARCEL.

19:27:25 , 
19:27:29 AS I UNDERSTAND I
19:27:37 AS I UNDERSTAND IT.

19:27:41 >> JAMES, THESE WERE APPROVED BY THE PARCEL AS WELL
19:27:44 .
>> Commissioner Yee:   AS YOU CAN SEE WE ZOOM IN THAT 24
19:27:47  FOOT WIDE SECTION WRIT NOW BECOMES
19:27:50  A TWO LANE ROAD CURRENTLY IT IS A ONE WAY IN
19:27:54  TO THE DRIVE THROUGH AND THERE IS 14 PARKING SPACES RIGHT THERE
TO
19:27:57  THE LEFT OF WHERE THAT 24-FOOT NUMBER IS.

19:28:06 >> I DON'T KNOW IF RON IS ON WITH CHASE BUT THIS IS ONE OF
19:28:09  THE DISCUSSIONS WE HAD EARLY IN THE PROJECT.
THERE IS A LOT
19:28:12  OF NEGOTIATION WITH THE LAND OWNER AND CARL
19:28:16 'S JR. AS WELL, EVERYONE IN THE CENTER IS AWARE OF THE DEVELOPMENT
19:28:20  AND AWARE OF THE CHANGES TO THE PARKING.

19:28:25 >> Commissioner Yee:   WELL, IF THAT'S THE CASE, THAT'S WHY I SAID
19:28:28 , WHEN I SPOKE, YOU KNOW, TO THE REGIONAL MANAGER
19:28:32  FOR CARL'S JR. HE HAD NO IDEA.
HE WAS TELLING
19:28:35  ME CLEARLY THAT THE TRAIN SPACES THAT ARE  COLORED IN
19:28:38  YELLOW ARE UNDER  CARL'S JUNIOR
19:28:42  CARL'S JR. PROPERTY SIDEN THE ONES THAT ARE
19:28:45  COLORED WHITE IS ON THE
19:28:48  DENNY'S SIDE.
THE WHITE IS THE
19:28:52  DEMARKATION BETWEEN THE TWO.
19:28:56 
>> AGREEMENT AT THE TIME -- SORRY IS
19:28:59  THAT RON, IS THAT YOU?
>> Planner Pullen:   THIS IS JOEL
19:29:02  THE COMMISSION SECRETARY.
SO WE DID REVIEW THE PLANS AS WELL
19:29:05  FROM THE CITY STANDPOINT.
AND SO WE'RE GET
19:29:09 TING PRETTY FAR INTO
19:29:12  TECHNICAL QUESTIONS ABOUT THE PROPERTY LINE
19:29:17  AND TENANT NEGOTIATIONS, THAT'S FINE.
JAMES
19:29:20  CAN ALSO PROVIDE SOME CLARITY LATER ON WITH STAFF AS WELL IN TERMS
19:29:23  OF WHAT
19:29:26  SUBJECT TO CITY AND WHAT IS A PRIVATE NEGOTIATION.
BUT I'LL SAVE THAT FOR LATER.

19:29:30 >> Commissioner Yee:   THE REASON WHY I'M ASKING IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS
19:29:34  DONE PROPERLY.
BECAUSE IF
19:29:37  THERE WERE PROPER DISCUSSIONS THEN THE WAY THAT THIS IS DESIGNED RIGHT
19:29:41  NOW MAY ENCROACH ON SOME OF THE OTHER PROPERTIES.
AND I
19:29:44  WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE ALSO PROTECTED, AS WELL
19:29:47 .

19:29:52 >> PATRICK.
TO GIVE A LITTLE MORE
19:29:55  INFORMATION, THERE WAS DISCUSSION WITH THE LANDLORD
19:29:59  QUITE EXTENSIVELY FROM THE BEGINNING.
MAYBE THAT AGREEMENT THAT YOU'RE
19:30:02  TALKING ABOUT BETWEEN DENLY'S AND CARL
19:30:05 'S WAS SOME SORT OF A HANDSHAKE
19:30:09  AGREEMENT, YOU PARK HERE, WE PARK THERE.
BUT
19:30:12  WE'RE FACING OUR PARKING OFF OF THE
19:30:15  PARCEL ITSELF.
>> YEAH AND WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE
19:30:18  OVERALL SHOPPING CENTER OWNERSHIP.
AND I
19:30:22  APPRECIATE THAT SOMEBODY PULLING UP THE EXISTING PLAN HERE
19:30:25 , THANK YOU.
I'M NOT ABLE TO LOCATE THAT
19:30:28  INFORMATION RIGHT NOW, QUICK ENOUGH.
BUT I'LL
19:30:31  GO BACK THROUGH AND LOOK AT WHEN WE BROUGHT UP THE CROSS
19:30:35 -PARKING AGREEMENT, WHAT RESULTED FROM THAT,
19:30:38  WHETHER OR NOT IT WAS A LEASE AGREEMENT TO OUR NEW LEASE
19:30:41  OR SOME OTHER TYPE OF YOU KNOW
WRITTEN EXCHANGE.

19:30:51 >> Commissioner Yee:   SO I GUESS FOR ME I'D LIKE TO HAVE CLARITY BEFORE
19:30:54  WE CAN MOVE FORWARD TO SOMETHING LIKE THIS.
BECAUSE RIGHT
19:30:58  NOW IT SOUNDS LIKE IT'S NOT CERTAIN
19:31:01 .
I WANT TO BE SURE WHAT IS THE PARCEL LINES AND HOW THE
19:31:04  PLANS IMPACT THAT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DO THIS RIGHT
19:31:09 .
>> WITH ALL DUE RESPECT
19:31:12  THE PARCEL LINES ON THE PLANS ARE SHOWN CORRECTLY.
19:31:15 
THE PARKING, YOU KNOW, WHETHER THEY HAD
19:31:18  SOME TYPE OF AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE TWO INTARLS THAT IS UP
19:31:21  PARCELS IT IS UP FOR
19:31:25  DISCUSSION.
BUT ALL THE PARK
19:31:28 ING SPACES ARE ON OUR SITE.
IT IS GOING TO BE A CHANGE FOR THE
19:31:31  CARL'S SITE BUT I KNOW THAT RON HAS HAD
19:31:34  LENGTHY DISCUSSIONS WITH THEM.

19:31:40 >> AND DAVE, I WAS REFERRED BACK TO THE DECLARATION OF
19:31:43  RESTRICTIONS AND GRANT  EASEMENTS.
AND THIS IS
19:31:47  FROM, LOOKS LIKE THE '80s.
BUT THAT WAS
19:31:50  A DOCUMENT THAT WAS CIRCLED BACK TO US WHEN
19:31:53  WE ASKED ABOUT THE SHARED PARKING AND THE JOINT ACCESS
19:31:58 .
AND THAT'S THE DISAGREEMENT THAT STILL
19:32:01  GOVERNS WHERE THIS PARCEL IS AND THEN HOW THE PARKING
19:32:05  GOES FOR THE OVERALL CENTER
19:32:08 .
19:32:11 
SO THAT WAS THE LANDLORD'S JUSTIFICATION FOR
19:32:14  THIS PIECE.

19:32:18 >> Commissioner Yee:   I GUESS I STILL HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT
19:32:21  --
>> SORRY SORRY.
>> Commissioner Yee:   I WAS GOING TO 
19:32:24 SAY I STILL HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THAT BECAUSE I ALSO CONTACTED THE
19:32:28  OWNER AT DENNY'S TO VERIFY IF
19:32:31  THOSE FOUR SPOTS THAT WERE BY STARBUCKS AND THESE
19:32:34  14, DOES IT
BELONG TO  THEM,
19:32:37  THEY TOLD ME NO.
19:32:46 
>> SO WE DO HAVE WRITTEN AND WE FORWARDED IT AS
19:32:49  WELL, WRITTEN APPROVALS FOR THE WAY THIS IS LAID OUT
19:32:52  FROM THE LANDLORD AND SHOPPING
19:32:55  CENTER OWNER.
>> Planner Pullen:   SO
19:32:58  IT'S PROBABLY APPROPRIATE THEN CHAIR FOR ME TO STEP IN HERE
19:33:02  BECAUSE THIS IS GOING FOR A WHILE
19:33:05 .
>> Commissioner Daulton:   PLEASE DO.
>> Planner Pullen:   IF YOU DON'T MIND 
19:33:08 I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY A BIT.
THE CITY
19:33:12  REVIEWS OVERALL PARKING SUFFICIENCY AND THE SHOPPING CENTER AS A
19:33:15  WHOLE.
IT IS A SHOPPING CENTER.
THERE ARE VAST FIELDS OF
19:33:18  PARKING THAT ARE AVAILABLE.
THERE ARE
19:33:21  AREAS THAT ARE MORE BUSY THAN OTHERS,
19:33:24  HIGHER LEVEL OF SERVICE, LESS DWELL TIME,
19:33:28  FOR VEHICLES SUCH AS ADJACENT TO
19:33:31  THE STARBUCKS AND THE CARL
19:33:34 'S JR. BUT THERE ARE PLENTY OF SPACES WITHIN THE
19:33:37 
ENTIRE SHOPPING CENTER.
WHAT IS UNIQUE TO THE SHOPPING
19:33:40  CENTER AND JAMES CAN CLARIFY WHEN WE GO BACK
19:33:44  TO STAFF QUESTIONS, THOUGH THIS IS A PROPERTY LINE AND
19:33:47  THE PERSON THAT'S AT THE HEARING TONIGHT IS
19:33:50  IN A TRACTION WITH THE
LANDLORD
19:33:53  TRANSACTION WITH THE
19:33:56  LANDLORD THAT OWNS THE ENTIRE SHOPPING CENTER NOTWITHSTANDING THE
19:33:59  PROPERTY LINES WITHIN THE LANDLORD'S CONTROL THAT THAT LANDLORD
19:34:03  CAN MAKE A DEAL WITH ANY ONE TENANT
AND MODIFY DEALS WITH
19:34:06  OTHER TENANTS.
AND THAT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT'S HAPPENED
19:34:09 .
SO THERE MAY BE CIVIL AMENDMENTS
19:34:12  OF LEASES THAT ARE EITHER
19:34:15  APPROVED OR PENDING APPROVAL, BASED
19:34:19  ON OTHER CHANGES WITHIN THE SHOPPING CENTER.
THAT'S
19:34:22  NORMAL DURING THE COURSE OF BUSINESS OF A SHOPPING  CENTER.
WE
19:34:25  ORDINARILY WOULDN'T GET INTO THOSE.
WE WOULD
19:34:29  JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT
19:34:32  THEY COMPLY WITH CITY REQUIREMENTS FOR
19:34:35  BOTH BUSINESS WE'RE LOOKING AT AND FOR THE
19:34:38  OVERALL SHOPPING CENTER.
THAT'S OUR PURVIEW.

19:34:50 >> I WANTED TO ADD IN ALL OF THE PARKING IS COMMON
19:34:53  PARKING THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE CENTER.
THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO
19:34:56   CROSS -- IT'S CROSS-ACCESS TO PARK BUT YEAH.

19:35:06 >> Commissioner Daulton:   COMMISSIONER YEE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS?
>> Commissioner Yee:  
19:35:10  NO, I THINK I'M DONE FOR THE TIME BEING.
19:35:11 
>> Commissioner Daulton:   THANK YOU.
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE 
19:35:15 COMMISSION?
SEEING NO HANDS, TRISH I WOULD LIKE
19:35:19  TO HAVE IT PUBLIC COMMENT.
19:35:22  INVITE PUBLIC COMMENT.
19:35:25 
DO WE HAVE ANY PUBLIC SPEAKERS ON THIS
19:35:28  ITEM?
>> CHAIR DAULTON WE HAVE ONE SPEAKER
19:35:31 .
LEASTIE
19:35:35 LISA
19:35:38  DANS GO AHEAD AND SPEAK.
19:35:42 
>> SOUNDS LIKE THIS IS ALREADY SET IN STONE BUT SOUNDS
19:35:45  LIKE SO TRUE.
DEFINITELY SAVE THE
19:35:49  TREES BECAUSE SICK TREES
19:35:53  DEFINITELY WORK TOWARDS OUR GOALS AND
19:35:56  PARK WORKS AGAINST IT.
THANK YOU.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   THANK YOU 
19:35:59 FOR THAT AND NO FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT SO I WOULD LIKE TO
19:36:03  CLOSE THE PUBLIC HEARING AT THIS TIME.
>> ACTUALLY I'M
19:36:06  SORRY CHAIRPERSON DAULTON I DID SEE ANOTHER HAND RAISED
19:36:09 .
>> Commissioner Daulton:   OH PLEASE.
>> LET'S GO AHEAD WITH
19:36:12  THAT.
THE NEXT SPEAKER IS MOW NEEN NEEK
19:36:16 .
MONIQUE I'VE JUST GIVEN YOU
19:36:19  PERMISSION, GO AHEAD AND SPEAK.
>> OKAY, THANK YOU VERY MUCH
19:36:22 .
I WAS WONDERING HOW MANY HANDICAP
19:36:25  SPOTS ARE AVAILABLE WITHIN THE AREAS THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT FOR THE BANK
19:36:30 ?
19:36:35 
>> Commissioner Daulton:   ALL RIGHT, WE DON'T ACTUALLY ANSWER DIRECT 
19:36:38 QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME MONIQUE BUT WE'LL SEE IF WE CAN GET
19:36:42  THE APPLICANT TO ADDRESS THAT WHEN WE GET BACK TO THEM
19:36:45 .
>> OKAY, THANK YOU.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   UH-HUH
19:36:48 , ALL RIGHT, THEN IF THAT IS THE LAST COMMENT WE'LL CLOSE THE
19:36:51  PUBLIC HEARING AND WE CAN GO BACK TO
19:36:55  THE APPLICANT ASKING FOR ANY
19:36:58  FURTHER COMMENTS ON THIS.
PERHAPS YOU COULD ADDRESS
19:37:01  THE QUESTION FROM THE PUBLIC.
>> SURE.
THERE ARE
19:37:04  TWO SPACES THAT ARE ADA DESIGNATED DIRECTLY
19:37:08  IN FRONT OF THE BANK, AS WELL AS TWO THAT ARE
19:37:11  EV CHARGER STATIONS
19:37:14 .
>> Commissioner Daulton:   OKAY.
AND
19:37:17  THIS IS YOUR TIME TO SAY ANYTHING ELSE THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO ABOUT
19:37:21  THIS PROJECT.
YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO TAKE IT.
19:37:24 
>> NO, THANK YOU, JUST APPRECIATE EVERYONE'S TIME
19:37:26 .
>> Commissioner Daulton:   OKAY, THANK YOU.

19:37:29 ALL RIGHT SO THEN LET'S COME BACK TO THE COMMISSION
19:37:32  AND, ARE THERE ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS BY THE COMMISSIONER
19:37:36 S REGARDING
19:37:39  THIS AGENDA ITEM?

19:37:42 ALL RIGHT.
I DON'T SEE ANY HANDS.

19:37:48 SO I WOULD, IN THAT CASE,
19:37:51  LOOK FOR A MOTION BY A COMMISSIONER.

19:37:56 >> Commissioner Steckler:   I MOVE STAFF RECOMMENDATION.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   MOTION.
19:37:59 
CAN I GET A SECOND
19:38:02 ?
>> Commissioner Zhang:   SECOND
19:38:05 .
>> Commissioner Daulton:   MOTION AND SECOND BY COMMISSIONER STECKLER, 
19:38:09 SECOND BY COMMISSIONER ZHANG.
JOEL COULD YOU READ THE VOTE.
>> Planner Pullen:   YES
19:38:12  CHAIR ON A MOTION BY COMMISSIONER STECKLER, SECOND
19:38:16  BY COMMISSIONER ZHANG TO APPROVE STAFF RECOMMENDATION ON
19:38:20  THE PROJECT.

19:38:38 
COMMISSIONER LIU.
19:38:41 
COMMISSIONER LIU IS PRESENT BUT WASN'T HERE FOR

COMMISSIONER ZHANG, AYE.

19:38:54 .
>> Commissioner Basrai:   ABSTAIN.

19:38:56 >> Planner Pullen:   OKAY, ALL RIGHT.
THE VOTE IS LET ME
19:39:00  JUST  TABULATE, FOUR IN FAVOR
19:39:04 , ONE OPPOSED, AND TWO
19:39:07  ABSTENTIONS.

19:39:13 .
PLANNING COMMISSION'S ACTION IN THIS ITEM WILL BE FINAL UNLESS
19:39:17  APPEALED TO CITY COUNCIL WITHIN TEN CALENDAR DAYS FROM TODAY.
19:39:19 
CHAIR, BACK TO YOU.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   ALL RIGHT, 
19:39:22 THANK YOU JOEL.
I BELIEVE OUR SECOND
19:39:26  ITEM IS
19:39:29  THE LUX DEVELOPMENT ON DECOTO SO JOEL IF YOU
19:39:32  WOULD INTRODUCE THE ITEM.
19:39:39 
AND STAFF PRESENTATION ON THIS AGENDA PIECE
19:39:42 .
>> Planner Pullen:   THANKS CHAIR.
THIS IS
19:39:45  SAKOON LUX HOMES, 40
19:39:48 92 DECOTO ROAD.
THIS IS TO CONSIDER A
19:39:54  Discretionary Design Review for Planning Commission, Private Street, and Tentative Tract Map
19:39:58  8580 to propose a new 4-Story building consisting of eight residential units over a parking
19:40:02  
garage, one community center
19:40:06  building, one commercial building, and a trash enclosure;
19:40:10  THIS IS ALL LOCATED IN THE NEVER
19:40:17  CENTERVILLE COMMUNITY PLAN AREA, AND IT'S ALSO TO
19:40:20  CONSIDER
AN
19:40:23  EXEMPTION FROM CEQA
19:40:27  AND THE PROJECT
19:40:31  PLANNER IS MARC CLEVELAND,
19:40:34  JUST SO EVERYBODY'S AWARENESS THE
19:40:39  APPLICATION GROUP OF TEN MINUTES TOTAL AND PUBLIC SPEAKERS AND A ADVERTISE MINUTE REBUTTAL

19:40:42 BY THE APPLICANT.
WITH THAT CHAIR WE'RE READY FOR
19:40:46  THE PRESENTATION WHEN YOU ARE.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   THANK YOU
19:40:49 , JOEL.
PROCEED.
>> I WANT TO JUST DOUBLE
19:40:52  CHECK YOU GUYS CAN SEE THAT.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   NOT YET
19:40:55 .

19:41:03 >> HOW ABOUT NOW?
>> Commissioner Daulton:   YES.
>> PERFECT, GOOD
19:41:06  EVENING COMMISSIONERS.
SO TONIGHT WE'LL BE GOING OVER THE
19:41:10  SAKOON LUX HOMES PROJECT.
THIS MAY LOOK FAMILIAR
19:41:14  TO SOME OF YOU AS THIS PROJECT CAME PREVIOUSLY OR
19:41:17  THIS GROUP PREVIOUSLY PROPOSED A PROJECT SIMILAR TO THIS ONE
19:41:20  AT THIS  SITE.
TONIGHT'S PRESENTATION WE'LL BE GOING OVER THE
19:41:23  ENTITLEMENTS AND PERMITS, THE BACKGROUND, THE SITE PLAN,
19:41:27  THE ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN, SOME ANALYSIS, AND
19:41:30  THEN THE RECOMMENDATIONS AND THEN FINALLY QUESTIONS
TO STAFF
19:41:33  AND THE DESIGN TEAM
19:41:36 .
THE REQUIRED ENTITLEMENTS AND PERMITS FOR
19:41:40  THIS PERMIT ARE THE
19:41:44  TENTATIVE TRACT MAP AND THE DISCRETIONARY REVIEW AND
19:41:49  THE STREET RUFNG DOWN
19:41:52  THE MIDDLE OF THIS PROJECT.
40
19:41:55 92 DECOTO.
SO IT'S BEEN A VACANT SITE.
PREVIOUSLY
19:41:58  THERE WAS A HOME ON IT BUT IT WAS
19:42:01  DEMOLISHED.
THEY ARE PROPOSING TO DO
19:42:04  ONE COMMERCIAL BUILDING OF ABOUT 960 SQUARE FEET
19:42:08 .
EIGHT MARKET RATE CONDOS
19:42:11  OVER A PARKING GARAGE AND THEN A COMMUNITY CENTER AS WELL LOCAT
19:42:14 ED IN THE CENTER.
THE COMMUNITY CENTER IN THE BACK WOULD ALSO
19:42:17  HAVE BIKE STORAGE AND YOUR ELECTRICAL ROOM.
DURING
19:42:21  THE PROCESS WE'VE HAD -- THERE'S
19:42:24  SEVERAL EVOLUTIONS OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE PLAN
19:42:27 .
SPECIFICALLY, HOW TO GET THE TRASH ENCLOSURE TO
19:42:30  WORK WITHIN PUBLIC SERVICES TRUCK FIRE DEPARTMENT
19:42:34  ACCESS AS FAR AS  LADDER PADS, ADJUSTING THE COMMERCIAL
19:42:37  SPACE AND SIZE TO FIT ON THE LOT, THE HOUSE
19:42:40 
DEMOLITION AS I PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED, THE PARKING
19:42:44  HAS GONE OVER A NEW ITERATION THAT INCLUDES
19:42:47  LIFTS.
AND THEN THE ADJUSTED
19:42:50  BIKE STORAGE PER THE SUGGESTIONS OF SOME RESIDENTS
19:42:54  AND ADVOCACY GROUP.
SO
19:42:57  THE SITE PLAN INCLUDES THE EIGHT CONDO UNITS LOCATE
19:43:00 ED TOWARDS THE BACK OVER THE  GARAGE, THE TWO SINGLE
19:43:03  STORY BUILDINGS, THE ONE COMMERCIAL AND THE
19:43:07  ONE COMMUNITY CENTER LOCATED IN THE FRONT.
AND THEN THE
19:43:11  NEW PRIVATE STREET DOWN THE CENTER
19:43:14  THAT LEADS INTO THE PARKING GARAGE.
THE
19:43:17  ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN IS AS MODERN LOOK, IT WOULD
19:43:21  HAVE VARIOUS DIFFERENT, SORRY, VARIOUS
19:43:24  DIFFERENT MATERIALS AND ARCHITECTURALLY MAKE IT A LITTLE
19:43:27  MORE INTERESTING.
THESE WOULD BE THE FRONT
19:43:30  AND THIS IS WHAT YOU WOULD SEE FROM DECOTO AND THIS IS THE BUILDING IN THE
19:43:33  BACK.
THE PARK
19:43:38 ING, WE WOULD HAVE,
19:43:41  WOULD MEET OUR STANDARDS.
IT HAS FOR
19:43:44  PLANNING PURPOSES, 27 SPACES
19:43:47 .
AS PART OF TONIGHT'S OR AS PART OF
19:43:50  THIS PROJECT WE DID SEND IN A GOLD SHEET THAT WAS IN
19:43:53  REGARDS TO THE PARKING THAT WAS BASED ON
19:43:57  SOME SUGGESTIONS FROM THE PUBLIC COMMENT ABOUT ACCESSIBLE SPACE
19:44:01 S.
AS A RESULT WE STARTED TALKING
19:44:04  WITH OUR BUILDING DEPARTMENT.
AND TO IMPROVE THE
19:44:07  ACCESSIBILITY WE DID ADD ONE MORE ADA SPACE.

19:44:13 AS FAR AS THE GENERAL PLAN IT FITS SEVERAL
19:44:16  DIFFERENT SPOT GOALS ABOUT INFILL, INFILLING
19:44:19  LOTS THAT ARE UNDERUTILIZED, AND
19:44:23  EMPHASIS ON MIXED USE IN THE AREA, AND WE WERE ABLE
19:44:26  TO FIND THAT IT WAS
OBJECTIVELY COMPLIANT WITH
19:44:29  ALL OF OUR STANDARDS AS FAR AS ZONING AND DESIGN.
SO
19:44:32  TONIGHT WE RECOMMEND THAT WE FIND THE PROJECT EXEMPT FROM
19:44:35  CEQA AND APPROVE BASED ON
19:44:39  THE FINDINGS AND CONDITIONS.
DO WE HAVE
19:44:42  ANY -- QUESTIONS PORTIONS OF THE EVENING WE WOULD BE
19:44:45  AVAILABLE FOR THAT.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   WE HAVE CLARIFYING QUESTIONS FROM THE
19:44:48  COMMISSION FOR STAFF AT THIS TIME.

19:44:56 SEEING NO HANDS AT THE PRESENT I WILL PROCEED TO THE
19:44:59  APPLICANT PRESENTATION.
IF YOU ARE AVAILABLE AND READY TO
19:45:03  GIVE YOUR PRESENTATION,
19:45:06  PLEASE, MR. HERALD.

19:45:11 >> THERE WE GO.
OKAY DOES EVERYBODY HEAR ME
19:45:14 ?
>> Commissioner Daulton:   YES.
>> MY NAME IS KURT HERALD
19:45:18  WITH HERALD ARCHITECTS
19:45:22 .
WE HAD A PLANNING COMMISSION MEETING BACK IN OCTOBER AND PRETTY
19:45:25  MUCH IT WAS DENIED BASED ON MY TAKE AWAY WAS
19:45:28  THE PARKING.
AND A LITTLE BIT
19:45:31  OF THE BIKE STORAGE THAT CAME UP AT THE LAST
19:45:35  MINUTE BEFORE THE PLANNING COMMISSION MEETING.
SO WE MET WITH
19:45:38  STAFF A BUNCH OF TIMES AND WENT BACK OVER THESE
19:45:41  CONCERNS.
AND OUR OFFICE WENT BACK THROUGH
19:45:45  AND BASICALLY REDESIGNED THE WHOLE FRONT PART OF THE PROJECT
19:45:48 , WE CREATED A REAL NICE LITTLE BICYCLE
19:45:52  LOCKER ROOM THAT ALLOWS
19:45:57  FOR -- FOR THE
19:46:00  LONG TERM BICYCLE PARKING
AND IT WORKS
19:46:03  OUT ACTUALLY PRETTY GOOD TO BE HONEST WITH YOU.
BEFORE WE HAD THE
19:46:06  LONG TERM  PARKING KIND OF SPREAD OUT AROUND THE PROPERTY
19:46:09 .
AND NOW IT'S ALL CONSOLIDATED,
19:46:12  WELL-LIT AND SHOULD WORK OUT PRETTY
19:46:15  NICE.
THE PARKING
19:46:20  THAT -- FROM THE OCTOBER MEETING, WE
19:46:23  WERE ACTUALLY WENT INTO THE MEETING WITH A SHARED
19:46:27  PARKING APPROACH.
19:46:30 
AND THERE WAS OBVIOUS QUESTIONS WITH ABOUT
19:46:33  IF THAT WOULD WORK ON SUCH A TIGHT KIND
19:46:37  OF  HIGH-DENSITY URBAN KIND
19:46:40  OF FEELING OF A PROJECT.
SO WHAT WE DID WAS
19:46:43  WE WENT BACK THROUGH AND ACTUALLY DOWNSIZED
19:46:46  THE COMMERCIAL PROPERTY A LITTLE BIT, THE COMMERCIALITY BUILDING
19:46:49  WHICH IS BUILDING NUMBER 1, REDUCED THE PARKING DEMAND
19:46:52  ON THAT BUILDING,
 WENT INSIDE THE PARKING GARAGE,
19:46:55  INTRODUCED EIGHT PARKING LIFTS, AND
19:46:58  SO I DID A -- DID RESEARCH ON PARKING
19:47:02  LIFTS TO BASICALLY PICK
19:47:05  OUT, ACTUALLY ONE MANUFACTURER BUT I'M LOOKING TO SEE
19:47:09  IF THERE'S
OTHER MANUFACTURERS.
BUT THESE PARK
19:47:12 ING LOTS ARE REALLY INTERESTING.
THEY HAVE A SINGLE ARM
19:47:15  AND THEY'RE OFF TO THE SIDE.
A LOT
19:47:19  OF THE -- THESE PARKING LIFTS HAVE FOUR POST
19:47:22 S IN ALL 74 CORNERS.

19:47:25  IT MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT TO NAVIGATE YOUR VEHICLE IN AND
19:47:28  OUT OF THE PARKING SPACE.
SO I KIND OF FOUND THIS REALLY
19:47:31  COOL LIFT THAT HAS THIS ARM ON THE SIDE WHICH KIND OF
19:47:35  TAKES ALL OF THAT OUT OF THE PICTURE AND ALLOWS FOR PEOPLE
19:47:38  TO GET IN AND OUT OF THEIR CARS AND BACK THEIR CARS
19:47:41  IN
AND OUT FEDERATE EASILY
19:47:44  PRETTY EASILY
19:47:47 .
FROM THE PROJECT WE SHOWS YOU PREVIOUSLY
19:47:51  WE WERE DEFICIENT, IF MY MEMORY
19:47:54  IS RIGHT, SIX OR SEVEN SPACES.

19:47:57 ON THIS PROJECT WE ARE IN THE POSITIVE OF FOUR OR FIVE SPACES
19:48:00  AND I THINK OVERALL ESPECIALLY WITH A COUPLE OF
19:48:03  CHANGES WE JUST MADE IN THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS BASED ON SOME
19:48:06  BUILDING DEPARTMENT ITEMS WE
NOW HAVE THESE TWO ADA PARK
19:48:10 ING STALLS BOTH ARE -- ONE
19:48:14  HAS EV CHARGERS AND THE OTHER ONE'S MORE OF
19:48:17  A CONVENTIONAL ADA SPACE.
NOW
19:48:20  EVERYTHING KIND OF WORKS MUCH, MUCH BETTER.
SO I'M
19:48:24  UP FOR SOME QUESTIONS IF ANYBODY HAS THEM.
I DO WANT
19:48:27  TO SAY WE SPENT A FAIR AMOUNT OF TIME WITH STAFF
19:48:30 , AND LOOKED AT MANY, MANY OPTIONS, AND WE FEEL
19:48:33  PRETTY GOOD ABOUT NOW HAVING THE PARKING RATIO IN OUR
19:48:36  FAVOR, AND PROVIDING
19:48:39  AMPLE BICYCLE PARKING
 FOR THE  FACILITY.

19:48:44 >> Commissioner Daulton:   THANK YOU SIR.
COMMISSIONERS, DO
19:48:47  WE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FOR THE APPLICANT?
I
19:48:52  SEE COMMISSIONER ZHANG HAS SOME QUESTIONS.
CHAIR RECOGNIZES
19:48:55  YOU SIR.
>> Commissioner Zhang:  
19:48:59  THANK YOU SIR.
MY QUESTION FIRST IS TO THE CITY STAFF
19:49:02 .
IT IS KIND OF A CAR LIFT, KIND OF ENTHUSE TO
19:49:05  ME.
IS IT
19:49:08  COUNT TOWARDS PARKING SPACE AT ALL?
IS THERE ANYTHING LIKE A
19:49:13  CODE EXAM FROM THAT?
19:49:18 
>> Commissioner Daulton:   IS THIS STAFF QUESTION
19:49:21 ?
>> Commissioner Zhang:   YES.

19:49:24 >> Commissioner Daulton:   MAYBE MARC CAN YOU HANDLE THAT
19:49:27  ONE FM.
>> Commissioner Zhang:  
19:49:31  I'M SAYING THIS CAR LIFT STACKED TOGETHER COUNT
19:49:34  AS TWO.
AT LEAST I'VE NEVER SEEN THAT IN FREMONT.

19:49:37 DOES IT REALLY COUNT TOWARDS TWO OR IS
19:49:40  THERE ANY CODE THAT CAN SPECIFY
19:49:43  THAT IT'S NOT OTHERWISE OR
19:49:47  --
>> IT DOES COUNT AS A PARKING SPOT.
WE'VE UTILIZED
19:49:50  THEM IN THE WARM SPRINGS
19:49:53  INNOVATION DISTRICT.
SPECIFICALLY IN THE
19:49:56  AFFORDABLE HOUSING SECTION.
WE HAVE WORKED
19:49:59  WITH CAR STACKERS AND THEY'RE BECOMING MORE OF A
19:50:03  THING.
THERE'S BEEN A COUPLE OF PROPOSALS
19:50:06  FOR THEM WITHIN THE CITY.
THEY DO PARK
19:50:09  COUNT.
IN
19:50:13  OUR FACILITY IT DOES
19:50:16  RECOGNIZE MOTORIZED LIFTSDZ,  YES, THEY DO
19:50:20  COUNT.
19:50:23 
>> Planner Pullen:   COMMISSIONER ZHANG ONE OTHER THING, ONE OF THE
19:50:27  THINGS WE REQUIRE IN
19:50:30  THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT, THEY HAVE TO BE INDEPENDENTLY ACCESSIBLE AND
19:50:33  THAT'S WHAT'S LED TO SOME OF THE REDESIGN
EFFORTS IS THAT THE
19:50:37  SAME OWNER WILL BE USING THE BOTTOM AND THE TOP
19:50:40  LIFT, RIGHT?
SO THEY HAVE CONTROL OVER BOTH
19:50:43  OF THOSE SPACES AND WITHIN THEIR HOUSEHOLD CAN DECIDE HOW
19:50:46  TO STORE AND WHO TO COME FIRST AND ALL THAT SORT OF
19:50:49  THING.
THAT IS A REQUIREMENT OF US THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO AND
19:50:53  ASK SOMEBODY ELSE TO MOVE THEIR CAR TO MOVE YOUR CAR.
19:50:56 
SO THAT'S IN THE ZONING.
YGZ SO
19:51:02 
>> Commissioner Zhang:   SO IF I UNDERSTAND CORRECT
19:51:05 LY, CAR LIFT, LET'S
19:51:09  GO TO THE 8th UNIT, EACH UNIT
19:51:12  GOT ONE.
OKAY,
19:51:15  THEN WHAT THE ALLOCATION OF THE REST
19:51:18  OF THE PARKING  SPACES, ARE THEY
19:51:22  JUST SHARED WITH THE COMMERCIAL BUILDING?
19:51:25 
>> SO IT'S REQUIRED WHEN -- SO YOU HAVE THE
19:51:28  -- FOR PARKING THIS IT WOULD TECHNICALLY BE EIGHT SPOTS ARE
19:51:31  REQUIRED FOR EIGHT UNITS SO IT'S ONE PER UNIT
19:51:34  PLUS HALF A COVERED SPOT.
IN THIS CASE WE'RE DOING TWO
19:51:38  SPOTS PER UNIT AND THEN THERE IS A REQUIREMENT TO HAVE,
19:51:41  IT'S HALF A SPOT PER UNIT FOR GUEST 
19:51:44  PARKING.
SO FOUR OF THEM WOULD BE ALLOCATED TO GUEST PARK
19:51:47 ING.
AND THEN WE'D HAVE TO HAVE
19:51:50  A MINIMUM OF THREE COMMERCIAL.
WE END
19:51:53  UP HAVING FIVE BECAUSE OF THE WAY OUR PARKING COUNT WORKS
19:51:58 .
>> Commissioner Zhang:   SO 23
19:52:02 , 22, 17, AND
19:52:05  THE 12 C ARE
19:52:08  GUEST PARKING?
>> I DON'T KNOW THAT THEY ARE DESIGNATE
19:52:14 ING THEM THAT WAY BUT THEY WOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR GUESTS
19:52:17 .
I DON'T KNOW THAT
19:52:22 .
>> Commissioner Zhang:   YOU'RE MUTED.
19:52:26 
>> Commissioner Daulton:   MARC WE'RE HAVING TROUBLE HEARING  YOU.

19:52:29 >> I'M SORRY I WAS MUTED.
THEORETICALLY,
19:52:32  YES, I DON'T KNOW IF THEY
19:52:35  ARE DESIGNATING, THIS IS THE REQUIRED PARKING WE NEED
19:52:38  BUT YEAH YOU COULD SAY THAT.

19:52:42 >> Commissioner Zhang:   YES, ALL RIGHT THANK YOU.
>> Commissioner Daulton:  
19:52:45  CHAIR RECOGNIZES COMMISSIONER YEE.
>> Commissioner Yee:   THANK  YOU.
I
19:52:48  GUESS I'M GOING TO GO IN A LITTLE BIT MORE
19:52:51  IN DETAIL ABOUT THIS STACKED PARKING.
SO I GUESS
19:52:55  MAYBE MARC YOU CAN ANSWER THIS TOO.
BECAUSE WITH THE GUEST
19:52:58  PARKING I'M ASSUMING NONE OF THAT GUEST PARK
19:53:01 ING IS GOING TO HAVE A  STACKER ON TOP OF IT SO
19:53:04  THEY DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT IF SOMEBODY
19:53:08  IS IN THEIR WAY SO TO SPEAK.
>> CORRECT
19:53:12 .
THAT'S WHY WE ENDED UP DURING THE DESIGN
19:53:15  PROCESS WE CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THERE WOULD BE EIGHT, FOR THE
19:53:18  UNITS AND THAT WOULD BE SEPARATE FOR THE GUEST PARK
19:53:21 ING.
SO NO ONE LIKE JOEL SAID
19:53:25  HAD TO MOVE IT UP OR DOWN, IT'S FOR THE OWNERS TO
19:53:28  USE THE STACKERS.
>> Commissioner Yee:   OKAY, I
19:53:31  GUESS THE OTHER QUESTION I WANTED TO ASK YOU WAS REGARDING THIS
19:53:34  COMMUNITY CENTER, THAT SAFERS THE
19:53:37  NEED FOR THAT I GUESS COMMUNITY OPEN
19:53:40  SPACE, YOU KNOW, SHARED SPACE.
DOES IT HAVE
19:53:43  TO BE AN ENCLOSED BUILDING OR KIT BE JUST AN
19:53:47  OPEN AREA THAT THEY CAN SHARE, THE RESIDENTS CAN SHARE
19:53:52 ?
>> Planner Pullen: 
19:53:55   SO I CAN STEP IN THERE.
I THINK WHAT YOU'RE ASKING
19:53:58  IS BY CODE, DO WE REQUIRE OPEN SPACE IN
19:54:01  ANY GIVEN CONFIGURATION.
WE REQUIRE AN
19:54:04  OPEN SPACE AT A CERTAIN CALCULATION
19:54:08  OF SQUARE FOOTAGE.
WE LIFE THAT TO THE APPLICANT
19:54:11 'S OPTION, WHETHER THAT IS
19:54:15  INTERIOR SQUARE FOOTAGE OR EXTERIOR SQUARE FOOTAGE
19:54:18 .
TOT LOT, ET CETERA.
ANY MUCH THOSE ARE WAYS
19:54:21  TO COMPLY WITH OUR CODE.
>> Commissioner Yee:   SO IT COULD BE AN OPEN AREA AND
19:54:24  NOT JUST HAVE TO BE IN A CLOSED
19:54:27  BUILDING?
>> Planner Pullen:   AT THE APPLICANT'S OPTION.
19:54:30 
>> Commissioner Yee:   THAT'S APPLICANT'S OPTION.

19:54:33 I GUESS MARC I WAS TRYING TO SEE HOW MANY
19:54:37  PEOPLE DID THE APPLICANT
19:54:40  SAY THAT THIS COMMUNITY CENTER CAN ACTUALLY HANDLE?
I THINK
19:54:44  IT WAS 40-SOMETHING RIGHT?

19:54:48 >> ASK ME WHAT THE FIRE OCCUPY LOAD IS I'M
19:54:51  NOT 100% SURE AND THAT WOULD BE PART OF THE
19:54:54  ASSEMBLY PERMIT THEY WOULD HAVE TO GET AS PART OF THIS  SUBMITTAL.
19:54:58 
BUT LET ME SEE IF I CAN TAKE A
19:55:01  LOOK REAL QUICK.
19:55:04 
>> IT'S UNDER TBHI.
>> Commissioner Yee:   48 OR SOMETHING 
19:55:08 LIKE THAT.
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT IT WAS 48.
NOW I
19:55:11  GUESS I'M GOING TO GO BACK TO THE APPLICANT IN TERMS OF QUESTION
19:55:14 .
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, IF IT'S MADE OR DESIGNED
19:55:17  TO HANDLE 48 AND THEN
19:55:20  THERE'S, YOU KNOW, THERE'S ONLY LIKE 20, WHAT IS IT
19:55:25  27 SPACES, AND DECEMBER DECOTO
19:55:29  ROAD IS NO PARKING.
THE CONCERN I HAVE IS
19:55:32  THAT IT'S GOING TO ATTRACT MORE
19:55:36  PEOPLE THAN WHAT THE PARKING CAN HANDLE
19:55:39  HANDLE.
YOU KNOW, BECAUSE I KNOW I SAW IN THE STAFF REPORT
19:55:42 , THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE DESIGNED JUST FOR RESIDENTS.
BUT IT
19:55:45  ALMOST LOOKS LIKE IT'S GOING TO BE DESIGNED FOR A COMMUNITY.
19:55:49 
ESPECIALLY WHEN I HEAR THE  WORDS,
19:55:52  "COMMUNITY CENTER."
SO I WANT TO MAKE SURE
19:55:55  THAT THIS IS REALLY DESIGNED JUST FOR THE RESIDENTS AND IT'S
19:55:58  NOT LIKE SOMETHING THAT IS GOING
19:56:01  TO BE A FACILITY THAT'S GOING TO BE
19:56:05  UTILIZED FOR LIKE A GENERAL PUBLIC
19:56:08  USE.
>> YES
19:56:11 , BETWEEN THE PROPERTY OWNERS AND I WE HAVE NEVER TALKED ABOUT
19:56:14  THAT.
IT'S ALL BEEN FOR -- THERE IS EIGHT
19:56:17  UNITS, YOU KNOW, EIGHT UNITS
19:56:21  SO IT'S FOR EIGHT FAMILIES TO
19:56:24  UTILIZE FOR GATHERINGS OR
19:56:27  MEETINGS OR THAT.
BUT IT'S NOT OPEN TO THE PUBLIC.
19:56:30 
BY ANY MEANS.
>> Commissioner Yee:   YEAH, THAT'S 
19:56:33 THE ONE CONCERN I HAVE BECAUSE IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT, TOO
19:56:37 , TWO, TWO BEDROOM CONDOS
19:56:40 , EIGHT TIMES THAT THAT'S ABOUT 16 PEOPLE
19:56:43  MAYBE KIDS OR TWO, YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT
20 TO 25
19:56:46  PEOPLE, THIS COMMUNITY CENTER CAN HANDLE ALMOST
19:56:49  DOUBLE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT ARE ACTUALLY GOING TO BE RESIDING THERE
19:56:53 .
>> YOU KNOW COMMISSIONER I
19:56:56  BELIEVE, I KNOW IT'S IN THE FORM OF A QUESTION BUT IF THAT'S A
19:57:00  CONCERN I THINK IT WILL PROBABLY
19:57:03  SELF POLICE ITSELF ANYWAY BECAUSE THEY WOULDN'T
19:57:06  BE ABLE TO GET 50 PEOPLE FROM
OFF THE
19:57:09  ROAD TO ONTO THE PROPERTY TO UTILIZE THE SPACE SO IT
19:57:12  NEVER WOULD BE UTILIZED THAT WAY.
I THINK IT WILL ACTUALLY SELF
19:57:16  POLICE ITSELF TO BEING WHAT THE INTENDED USE
19:57:19  IS WHICH IS FOR THE PROPERTY OWNERS FOR THE EIGHT
19:57:22  UNITS THAT ARE THERE.
>> Commissioner Yee:   SO I GUESS THE QUESTION IS DO YOU
19:57:25  REALLY NEED TO HAVE IT AS AN ENCLOSED BUILDING, COULD
19:57:29  YOU HAVE IT JUST AS AN OPEN AREA  INSTEAD
19:57:32 ?
>> WELL, THROUGH THE DESIGN PROCESS, AND GIVEN
19:57:36  THE OPTION TO DO AN OUTDOOR SPACE OR DO AN 
19:57:39  INDOOR SPACE, THESE EIGHT OWNERS WANT
19:57:42 ED AN INDOOR SPACE BECAUSE THEY COULD SEE THAT
19:57:45  USING USED A LOT MORE
THAN AN OUTDOOR SPACE
19:57:48 .
SO IT WAS A -- IT WAS
19:57:52  A PROPERTY OWNER DISCUSSION
19:57:57  AND DECISION.
>> Commissioner Yee:   SO YOU ALREADY HAVE, WHAT YOU
19:58:00  JUST  SAID, ABOUT EIGHT OWNERS ALREADY ARE COMMITTED TO
19:58:03  PURCHASE THESE PROPERTIES?
>> YES
19:58:06 , THEY'RE -- I DON'T KNOW HOW -- I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S ALL
19:58:09  BEEN LEGALLY PUT TOGETHER BUT THAT'S THE IDEA, THERE WILL
19:58:13  BE EIGHT OWNERS OF EACH OF THOSE UNITS, AND
19:58:16  THEN -- OR THERE WILL BE AN OWNER
FOR EACH OF THOSE UNITS
19:58:20  AND THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO UTILIZE THIS
19:58:23  LITTLE COMMUNITY ROOM
19:58:26  FOR THEIR, LIKE I SAID FOR FAMILIES OR GATHER
19:58:29 INGS OR, YOU KNOW, CHRISTMAS,
19:58:33  OR HANUKKAH OR WHATEVER THEY HAVE, YOU
KNOW, GOING
19:58:36  ON.

19:58:41 >> Commissioner Yee:   BEAR WITH ME, MY OTHER PHONE IS GOING OFF RIGHT NOW
19:58:44 .
BUT I GUESS MY
19:58:48  CONCERN IS THIS IS
19:58:53  A SIZE OF A COMMUNITY CENTER THAT WOULD
19:58:56  BE MORE THAN ADEQUATE FOR ALL THE PEOPLE THAT ARE THERE
19:59:00 .
AND I'M TRYING NOT TO SEE
19:59:03  IT ENCOURAGE MORE PEOPLE THAN IT SHOULD
19:59:07 , TO COME TO THAT PROPERTY
19:59:10  PROPERTY.
BECAUSE AS WE KNOW, DECOTO
19:59:14  ROAD THERE IS NO PLACE TO PARK BECAUSE THERE IS NO PARKING.
SO
19:59:17  THEY LITERALLY WOULD HAVE TO BE SHUTTLED IN, IF IT
19:59:20  EXCEEDS THE
19:59:24  AMOUNT OF PEOPLE THAT CURRENTLY RESIDE THERE.
LIKE
19:59:27  YOU SAY THE EIGHT OWNERS.
SO WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE TO REDUCE
19:59:31  THE SIZE BECAUSE YOU DON'T NEED TO HAVE IT QUITE THAT LARGE?
SO
19:59:34  THAT IT CAN HANDLE THE EIGHT OWNERS
19:59:37 , THEIR PARTICULAR NEEDS?

19:59:46 BECAUSE I KNOW THE MIM AN CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG YOU HAVE
19:59:50  TO HAVE 650 SQUARE FEET.
MAYBE WE KEEP IT
19:59:53  AT 650 RATHER THAN GOING TO 871
19:59:56 .
>> WELL, I MEAN IF YOU LOOK AT THE FLOOR PLAN, I HAVE
19:59:59  A LITTLE TV AREA A LITTLE KITCHEN AREA
20:00:03  WITH AN ISLAND.
I'VE GOT A NICE LITTLE DINING AREA
20:00:06 .
SO I MEAN IF YOU LOOK AT IT OR THE THE SPACE IT'S
20:00:09  NOT AN ASSEMBLY AREA WHERE IT'S
20:00:12  A BANQUET HALL OR
20:00:15  A LECTURE PLACE, YOU KNOW, A LECTURE HALL
20:00:19  WHERE IT'S NOTHING BUT FOLDING SEATS.
THIS IS GOING
20:00:22  TO BE KIND OF LIKE A MINI LITTLE LIKE LIVING
20:00:25  ROOM WHERE IF THE -- IF A
20:00:30  SUPER BOWL SUNDAY IS UP THEY COULD GATHER IN THIS ROOM
20:00:33  AND WATCH THE GAME TOGETHER.
THAT WAS TRULY
20:00:37  THE IDEA.
AND FOR ME I DON'T
20:00:40  SEE THE SIZE BEING
20:00:43  -- BEING A -- I
20:00:46  GUESS A DESIGN VARIABLE.

20:00:50 >> COULD I MAKE A POINT OF CLARIFICATION REAL QUICK?
THE OPEN
20:00:53  SPACE ROOM ITSELF COMMISSIONER IS JUST
20:00:56  706 SQUARE FEET.
THE ADDITIONAL SQUARE FOOTAGE COMES FROM
20:00:59  THE BIKE LOCKER AND THE ELECTRICAL ROOM.
SO YOU WOULD
20:01:02  BE LOOKING ABOUT REDUCING IT ABOUT 55
20:01:05  SQUARE  FEET, 56 SQUARE FEET.
20:01:09 
>> Commissioner Yee:   SO YOU'RE TELLING ME THE 706
20:01:12  SQUARE FEET CAN STILL ACCOMMODATE 48 PEOPLE
20:01:17 ?
>> I'M SORRY COULD YOU SAY THAT AGAIN?

20:01:20 I'M SORRY.
>> Commissioner Yee:   I SAID WHAT MARC
20:01:23  WAS JUST SAYING, THE  706 SQUARE FEET IS DOING
20:01:26  THE CALCULATIONS TO ACCOMMODATE ABOUT 48 PEOPLE?
>> YES
20:01:29 , IT'S JUST A BUILDING CODE, JUST A BUILDING CODE GO TO
20:01:32  THE TABLE I THINK IT'S 15 SQUARE FEET PER PERSON SO YOU TAKE
20:01:36  THE NUMBER DIVIDE BY 15 AND THAT'S THE
20:01:40  MAXIMUM OCCUPANCY
20:01:43  FOR
THAT ROOM.
>> Planner Pullen:   I FEEL
20:01:46  THE NEED TO STEP IN A LITTLE BIT.
WE HAVE A COMMON OPEN
20:01:49  SPACE STANDARD.
THE COMMON OPEN SPACE COULD BE PROVIDED AGAIN LIKE
20:01:52  A LAWN OR A BARBECUE AREA.

20:01:55 YOU COULD HAVE A SIZABLE GREUM GROUP IN AN
20:01:58  OPEN SPACE AREA.
IT'S PROBABLY BEEN MORE COMMON DURING
20:02:02  COVID TO HAVE THAT.
BUT WE ALLOWED BY RIGHT
20:02:05  IN AN
20:02:09  OBJECTIVELY COMPLIANT WAY, YOU
20:02:12  TO PROVIDE A COMMON OPEN SPACE FACILITY IN THE
20:02:15  INTERIOR OF A BUILDING.
AND SO WE'RE SEEING A LOT WITH
20:02:18  NEW PROJECTS, A COMBINATION OF SEVERAL THINGS.
20:02:21 
ONE IS, WORK SPACE.
WHERE
20:02:24  EXISTING RESIDENTS CAN GO IN AND SOMETIMES THEY'LL
20:02:27  CORDON OFF FROM THE COMMON OPEN SPACE A LITTLE AREA FOR
20:02:31  SOMEONE TO HAVE AN ONLINE MEETING.
IT MIGHT BE AN
20:02:34  HOA MEETING ROOM.
IT MIGHT BE SORT
20:02:37  OF A KITCHEN OF SOME SORT.
YOU MIGHT HAVE
20:02:42  LIKE THE APPLICANT SAID, SOME OTHER ELEMENT
20:02:45  TO THAT.
20:02:50 
BUT IF YOU DO THE MATH, I DON'T THINK IT'S OUT
20:02:54  OF CHARACTER FOR THE SIZE.
THE AVERAGE UNIT HAS
20:02:57  ABOUT THREE RESIDENTS, ABOUT 24,
20:03:01  IF THEY HAD FOUR PEOPLE IN THE
20:03:04  VISITOR PARKING THAT WOULD BE 12 MORE
20:03:08 .
THERE'S SOME BIKE SPACES.
YOU GET TO 40 OR
20:03:11  SO PRETTY  EAS
20:03:15  EASILY FOR AN ALL HANDS
20:03:18  RECREATION ROOM, EXERCISE BIKES,
20:03:21  THOSE KINDS OF THINGS.
THOSE WOULD ALL BE
20:03:24  NORMAL AND I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR WE CAN ASK THE
20:03:31  APPLICANT IF THEY CONSIDERED OTHER TYPES EVER OPEN SPACE BUT THE
20:03:34  TYPE OF OPEN SPACE IS ALLOWED BY RIGHT
20:03:38  AND OBJECTIVE ON
THE CODE.
I
20:03:41  DO HEAR THE COMMISSIONERS SAYING WHEN IT COMES
20:03:45  TO -- WHEN IT COMES TO NOT WANTING TO HAVE A SORT OF
20:03:48  A FULL COMMUNITY CENTER, PEOPLE FROM OUTSIDE THE
20:03:51  DEVELOPMENT THAT WOULD TOTALLY USE UP
20:03:54  ALL ONSITE
AND, YOU KNOW, MUCK UP
20:03:59  THE STREET IN THE VICINITY.
THAT WOULD BE AN ISSUE
20:04:02 .
BUT THAT WOULD BE AN ISSUE IN
20:04:06  ANY RESIDENTIAL ENVIRONMENT WHERE, YOU KNOW, THINGS LIKE
20:04:09  A BIRTHDAY PARTY OR SOMETHING ELSE COULD HAPPEN.
20:04:12 
I THINK THAT'S FOR HOA TO MANAGE AND FOR THE
20:04:15  CITY TO REACT TO ON
20:04:18  A NUISANCE BASIS IF IT WERE TO OCCUR.

20:04:29 >> Commissioner Daulton:   COMMISSIONER YEE ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS?
>> Commissioner Yee:   NO, I THINK 
20:04:32 THAT'S IT FOR THE TIME BEING.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   THANK YOU
20:04:36 .
COMMISSIONER ZHANG DID I SEE YOUR HAND UP
20:04:40 ?
>> Commissioner Zhang:   YES, JUST GENERAL COMMENTS
20:04:43 .
WHEN I SPOKE TO THE BUSINESS OWNER NEXT
20:04:46 , IT'S VERY POSSIBLE THE HOMEOWNERS THROW A PARTY
20:04:50 , A BIRTHDAY PARTY, THAT THE PARKING MAY OVER
20:04:53 FLOW TO OTHER BUSINESS AREAS LIKE THE GAS STATION OR THE
20:04:56 
McDONALD'S, THAT THIS CONNECTS WITH.
THEY
20:04:59  HAVE A MIXED FEELING THAT ON THE ONE SIDE
20:05:03  THEY OCCUPY A PARKING SPACE, THE OTHER SIDE THEY PROBABLY BRING
20:05:06  SOME BUSINESS LIKE ADDING GAS OR BUYING SOME
20:05:09  FOOD.
SO IT'S GOING
20:05:13  TO THIS CONFIGURATION
20:05:17 .
THE COMMUNITY VOICE THAT IS SAYING FOR THE BUILDING
20:05:20  ON TOP OF THE COMMERCIAL BUILDING, MAKING IT A
20:05:23  TWO-STORY WAS POSSIBLE.
20:05:27 
BUT I'M JUST THROWING OUT IDEAS
20:05:30 .
LIKE JOEL SAID, THIS IS THE OTHER THAN
20:05:33  OWNER
20:05:36 'S CHOICE HE GUESS.
THANK YOU.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   MARC I DO
20:05:40  HAVE A QUESTION.
I'VE NEVER CROWNED
20:05:43  ENCOUNTERED IN THE REAL WORD A STACKER IN
20:05:47  A SITUATION LIKE THIS.
SO HYPOTHETICALLY IF
20:05:50  I WAS GOING TO PARK MY CAR AS A PATE ROB OF THE
20:05:53  COMMERCIAL PART OF THE DEVELOPMENT THERE, AND I
20:05:57  WENT, DROVE THROUGH THE PROOUCHT STREET AND
20:06:03  BRIEFT STREET AND
INTO THE PARK
20:06:06 ING GARAGE, IS THERE A MECHANISM THAT
20:06:10  PREVENTS ME FROM PARKING IN THE
20:06:13  EMPTY STACKER SPOT?
>> I'M NOT 100
20:06:16 % SURE.
I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE EXACT MODEL THEY ARE GOING TO
20:06:20  END UP GETTING BY THE TIME THE BUILDING PERMIT COMES
20:06:23  AROUND BUT IT WAS LOWERED I GUESS THEY COULD DRIVE ON THAT
20:06:26  THEORETICALLY BUT
THEY'RE FOR RESIDENT USE ONLY AND WOULD
20:06:29  BE MARKED AS SUCH.
20:06:32 
>> Planner Pullen:   AND THE ORDINARY WAY IN A PARKING GARAGE TO MANAGE THAT
20:06:36  WOULD BE THROUGH SIGNAGE.
RESERVED, RESIDENT ONLY
20:06:42 , PAVEMENT BRANDED PARTICULARLY IN THE FRONT
20:06:45  OF THE SPACE IS  COMMON,
20:06:48  SOMETHING COLORED.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   OKAY AND TO THE APPLICANT
20:06:51  IS THAT IN THE WORKS?
TO BE
20:06:54  VISIBLY RESTRICTED FOR THOSE STACKERS?

20:06:58 BECAUSE MAN I WOULD HAVE HEADED STRAIGHT FOR ONE OF THOSE IF I COULDN'T
20:07:01  FIND A SPACE.
20:07:04 
>> (LAUGHING) WELL, WE HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT ALL THE SIGNAGE
20:07:08 .
WE'VE BEEN FOCUSING IN ON TRYING TO GET THE NUMBER
20:07:11  OF PARKING SPACES IN THERE.
THERE
20:07:14  THEORETICALLY WOULD BE THREE OPEN SPACES FOR COMMERCIAL AND FOUR
20:07:17  OPEN SPACES FOR RESIDENTIAL GUEST PARKING.
SO DURING
20:07:20  THE DAY IF THERE ARE NO RESIDENTIAL GUESTS,
20:07:24  THERE WILL BE CONCEIVABLY SEVEN OPEN PARKING
20:07:27  SPACES
20:07:31  AVAILABILITY FOR THE COMMERCIAL.
AND REMEMBER THIS COMMERCIAL IS ONLY
20:07:34  960 SQUARE FEET.
AND
20:07:38  SO MY OFFICE IS 1800 SQUARE FEET
20:07:41  AND WE HAVE FOUR OR 75 PEOPLE.
20:07:44 
SO IT'S ABOUT HALF.
SO I'M GUESSING
20:07:47  IT WOULD PROBABLY BE TWO OR THREE, GOSH
20:07:50  MAYBE FOUR PEOPLE AT THE MAX IN THAT COMMERCIAL
20:07:54  SPACE.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   I'M THINKING MORE ALONG THE
20:07:57  LINES OF THE BIRTHDAY PARTY SITUATION
20:08:00 , WHERE YOU TAKE WHATEVER SPACE IS
20:08:04  AVAILABLE.
AND IF ONE OF THOSE STACK
20:08:07 ER SLOTS IS AVAILABLE I MIGHT SLIDE IN THERE.
I DON'T KNOW
20:08:10 .
COULD CAUSE PROBLEMS.
I JUST THINK IT'S A CONSIDERATION
20:08:13  YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO LOOK AT.
OKAY.
ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE
20:08:17  COMMISSION?
20:08:22 
>> Planner Pullen:   ON THE STACKER QUESTION CHAIR, WE DO HAVE
20:08:25  MANY HOAS IN FREMONT THAT OR THE YEARS HAVE OPERATED
20:08:29  THEIR GUEST PARKING ON
20:08:32  A RESERVATION BASIS.
AND SO
20:08:35  IT'S COMMON TO HAVE
20:08:39  AN ONLINE SIGNUP OR YOU CONNECT WITH THE RESIDENT AND
20:08:42  THEY SIGN YOU UP AND THEN YOU ARE GIVEN A SPACE FOR
20:08:45  A CERTAIN NIGHT.
I KNOW SEVERAL
20:08:48  EXISTING LARGE AND SMALL
20:08:52  RESIDENTS OR PROJECTS DO THAT.
THAT COULD BE AN OPTION TO REDUCE
20:08:56  THE PROBABILITY OF THAT HAPPENING, ALTHOUGH IT WOULD
20:08:59  NOT BE A
20:09:03  REQUIREMENT BY THE CITY.
IT WOULD JUST BE A MITIGATION FOR
20:09:06  THEIR OWN SANITY.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   THANK YOU
20:09:09  JOEL.
CHAIR RECOGNIZES COMMISSIONER YEE.
20:09:12 
>> Commissioner Yee:   THANK YOU.
I JUST WANT SOME CARAT
20:09:15  CLARITY ON THAT
20:09:19  FIRE LADDER FOR THESE CONDOS.
IT
20:09:22  LOOKS LIKE IT COULD BE UP TO A FOUR STORY HIGH STRAIGHT LAD
20:09:25  LADDER.
COULD YOU GIVE ME A
20:09:28  LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL ABOUT THAT FIRE  LADDER?

20:09:31 ON ONE SIDE IS THE STAIRWELL AND THE ELEVATOR TO GET OUT IF
20:09:35  THERE WAS A FIRE.
THE OTHER SIDE IT LOOKS LIKE THEY ARE
20:09:38  JUST THIS LADDER.
>> THERE ARE LADDER BAD
20:09:41  PADS THERE, NO
20:09:45  PHYSICAL LADDER.
BASED ON FIRE
20:09:48  CODES, THIS IS TALKED ABOUT A GREAT DEAL
20:09:51  BY ONE OF OUR PLAN CHECKERS AND
20:09:55  KURT WENT BACK AND FORTH WITH THE EXACT LOCATION.
THEY WORK
20:09:58  WITH THE LADDERS, AT THE RIGHT ANGLE FOR
20:10:02  ENOUGH CLEARANCE FOR SOMEONE TO GET UP THERE AND COME BACK
20:10:05  DOWN WITH SOMEONE.
IT IS ONE OFMENT FIRE
20:10:08  PROTECTION CODES THAT WE HAVE SO THEY CAN GET LADDERS UP THERE.
IN
20:10:11  THE CASE OF WELL WE CAN'T GET THE PERSON
20:10:14  DOWN IN THE STAIRWELL OR THE ELEVATOR, THEY
20:10:17  HAVE  LADDER PADS AND MANY OTHER WAYS
20:10:21  TO GET OUT.
KURT WOULD LIKE
20:10:25  TO ADD TO THAT.
>> IF I MAY ADD, THE
20:10:28  BUILDING REQUIREMENT ONLY REQUIRES ACCESS SECOND OR THIRD FLOORS.
20:10:31 
THEY DON'T REQUIRE THEM TO GO UP ANY HIGHER.

20:10:34 AND WHAT MAKES THIS PROJECT
20:10:37  AND MANY OF THE MIXED USE PROJECTS
20:10:40  CHALLENGING, THE SECOND FLOOR IS REQUIRED TO BE LIKE
20:10:44  IN THIS CASE 16 FEET UP IN THE AIR.
SO
20:10:47  THAT SECOND FLOOR IS NOT A TYPICAL, IF THIS WAS
20:10:50  JUST AN APARTMENT BUILDING, THE SECOND FLOOR MAY
20:10:53  BE TEN FEET IN THE  AIR.
SO THIS ADDS ANOTHER SIX FEET.
SO
20:10:56  IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF A STRETCH FOR THE LADDERS,
20:11:00  BUT WHAT YOU SEE ON THE DRAWINGS IS A
20:11:04  DIAGRAM IT'S BECAUSE ABOUT IT'S -- IT IS A
20:11:07  DIAGRAM OF HOUSE THE LADDER AT THE PROPER REQUIRED
20:11:10  LADDER ANGLE IS
-- HOW
20:11:13  IT CAN BE PLACED AND HOW IT CAN REACH THE SILL
20:11:16  OF THAT THIRD FLOOR WINDOW.
AND I
20:11:20  WENT ROUND AND ROUND WITH HOWARD HANCOCK, AND
20:11:23  ACTUALLY REDESIGNED A COUPLE OF THE WINDOWS AND
20:11:26  MOVED WINDOWS  AROUND.
AND -- TO BE ABLE
20:11:30  TO MAKE SURE THAT THE FIRE DEPARTMENT HAS A
20:11:35  PROPER, CLEAR SPACE TO PUT THE LADDER AND THE ACCESS UP
20:11:38  TO THOSE WINDOWS.

20:11:41 >> Commissioner Daulton:   OKAY.
>> Commissioner Yee:   OKAY
20:11:44 , THANK YOU.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   CHAIR
20:11:47  RECOGNIZES COMMISSIONER ZHANG AGAIN.
>> Commissioner Zhang:   THANK YOU CHAIR.

20:11:50 I NOTICE THERE IS A NO PARKING MARKER AT THE END
20:11:54  OF THE DESIGN.
BUT NEXT TO IT,
20:11:58  THERE'S AN EV CHARGER STATION.
20:12:01 
WHY DOES EV CHARGER STATION HAVE
20:12:04  TO BE PLACED THERE?
>> THERE IS ONE EV --
20:12:07  THERE IS ONE ADA ACCESSIBLE PARKING
20:12:10  SPACE THAT HAS AN
20:12:14  EV CHARGER TO IT.
20:12:17 
AND WE
20:12:21  MAY LOOK AT MARC'S WHAT
20:12:24  DO YOU CALL IT GOLD LEAF --
>> AN OLD
20:12:27 ER MODEL THAT DID HAVE THE NO PARK
20:12:30 ING SPACE AT THE END.
IF YOU DON'T MIND I'LL SHOW YOU
20:12:33  WHAT THE ADJUSTED GOLD SHEET LOOKED LIKE.
I
20:12:37  HAVE THAT UP RIGHT NOW.
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WHAT WAS
20:12:40  DOWN IN HERE.
IT'S BEEN SINCE SHIFTED UP TO --
20:12:43  THEY SWAPPED THESE TWO SPOTS ESSENTIALLY.
SO NOW
20:12:46  YOU DO HAVE THIS ADA SPOT WITH THE NO PARKING
20:12:49  AND THEN YOU HAVE DOWN HERE THE TWO PARKING
20:12:53  SPOTS.
>> Commissioner Zhang:  
20:12:56  OKAY, I GUESS HEN THE PARKING
20:12:59  SPACE 12 ON OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE -- IS
20:13:03  REALLY HARD TO GET OUT, IF I SEE
20:13:06  CORRECTLY.
EVEN GET IN
20:13:10 .
20:13:15 
GENTLEMEN THE VERY LAST, 12C AND 13
20:13:19 C.
>> WELL, THERE IS AN APPROPRIATE AMOUNT
20:13:22  OF CLEARANCE.
THEY MAINTAIN THE 24 INCH
20:13:25  DRIVE AISLE.

20:13:31 >> Planner Pullen:   24 FOOT.
>> 24 FOOT, SORRY
20:13:34 , NICE TWO-FOOT
20:13:37  TWO-FOOT.
>> AND FOR SPACES 12 AND 13, THERE'S ACTUALLY
20:13:41  FOUR FEET OF SPACE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE PAGE
20:13:44  FOR THEM TO KIND OF BACK OUT AND TURN.
20:13:47 
AND THEN HEAD OUT.

20:13:53 >> Commissioner Zhang:   OKAY.

20:13:58 >> AND FOR THE BENEFIT, I MEAN 12 IS A COMPACT
20:14:02  SPACE.
THAT JUST MIGHT HELP HIM GET OUT A
20:14:05  LITTLE BIT EASIER.
>> Commissioner Zhang:  
20:14:09  I GUESS BOTH THE LIFTED SPACE AND THE GROUND SPACE
20:14:12  ARE BOTH COMPACT SIZE
20:14:15 ?
OR
20:14:18  --
>> YES, ONLY BECAUSE OF THE LENGTH
20:14:22 .
SO THAT'S A GOOD POINT
20:14:26 .
SO LIFT 9 AND THE LIFT
20:14:29  11 WOULD BE COMPACTS.
BUT ALL THE OTHER
20:14:32  LIFTS WOULD BE REGULAR STANDARD SIZE.

20:14:37 >> Commissioner Zhang:   OKAY.

20:14:43 I HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION.
SO IF I READ THE
20:14:47  LAST MEETING MINUTES CORRECTLY, THERE ARE CONCERNS
20:14:50  ABOUT THE THE EXIT BECAUSE IT IS FACING THE
20:14:53  PRETTY HEAVY TRAFFIC OF DECOTO'S.

20:14:56 ANY CHANGE SINCE LAST DESIGN AND THIS
20:15:00  ONE?
>> YES, I'M NOT
20:15:03  FAMILIAR WITH WHAT SPECIFICALLY THAT'S ALL ABOUT.
DECOTO
20:15:06  IS A VERY OBVIOUSLY EVERYBODY KNOWS IS A VERY
20:15:09  FAST STREET.
IN THIS CASE WE DO HAVE AN
20:15:12  ACCREDIT-
20:15:16   EXTRA-WIDE
20:15:19  26 FOOT WIDE DRIVEWAY WHICH WOULD HELP
20:15:22  PEOPLE COMING OFF OF DECOTO AND ENTERING ONTO THE
20:15:26  PROPERTY WHERE 20 FEET
20:15:29  WOULD BE NORMAL.
SO
20:15:32  THAT WOULD HELP PEOPLE  GETTING OFF OF DECOTO ONTO THE
20:15:35  PROPERTY.
>> Commissioner Zhang:   CURRENT THE
20:15:39  SIDEWALK STOP AT YOUR NEXT PROPERTY RIGHT?
AND YOU'RE GOING
20:15:42  TO EXTEND THAT IN THE SAME ACROSS YOUR  PROPERTY, RIGHT?
20:15:45 
>> YEAH, WE'VE COORDINATE
20:15:48 ED WITH THE ENGINEERING AND TRANSPORTATION
20:15:52  DEPARTMENT IN FREMONT.
THEY HAVE A
20:15:56  SIDEWALK DESIGN ALREADY LAID OUT FOR THAT PART
20:16:00  OF DECOTO WHICH WE'VE
20:16:03  INCORPORATED INTO OUR PLAN.

20:16:13 IT'S NOT -- THEY HAVE ACCESS TO DESIGN
20:16:17  INSIDE THEIR PROPERTY LINE, THEY HAVE THEIR OWN
20:16:20  SIDEWALK AND CURB AND GUTTER CONFIGURATION.

20:16:24 >> Commissioner Zhang:   OKAY.
THANK YOU.

20:16:27 >> YOU'RE WELCOME.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   ALL RIGHT, ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS FOR
20:16:31  APPLICANT OR STAFF?
FROM COMMISSION?
IF
20:16:34  NOT, I BELIEVER WE CAN INVITE PUBLIC
20:16:37  COMMENT AT THIS TIME, TRISH DO WE HAVE ANY SPEAKERS?
20:16:41 
>> CHAIRPERSON DAULTON I'M  LOOKING NOW AND I DON'T -- OH
20:16:44 , YES WE DO.
OKAY WE HAVE ONE SPEAKER.
LET
20:16:47  ME INTRODUCE THE SPEAKER
20:16:50 .
20:16:53 
GRACE CADAVANICH,
20:16:57  GO AHEAD AND SPEAK.
>> GOOD EVENING,
20:17:00  ANDREAS  KADAVANICH
20:17:03  WITH BIKE FREMONT.
WE SUBMITTED SOME WRITTEN
20:17:06  COMMENTS.
I'D LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THAT THE BIKE PARKING ON
20:17:09  THIS DESIGN ACTUALLY LOOKS REALLY GOOD.
IT IS
20:17:12  ORDINARY OF
20:17:15  ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE BETTER THAN
20:17:19  WHAT WAS SUBMITTED LAST YEAR.
SOME OF OUR
20:17:22  COMMENTS ARE BASICALLY ADDRESSING HOW DO YOU
20:17:25  MAKE IT EVEN BETTER AND GO BEYOND THE
20:17:29  MINIMUM REQUIRED BIKE CODE BUT REALLY I'D LIKE TO SEE
20:17:32  ALL DEVELOPMENTS PUT THIS MUCH THOUGHT INTO
COMPLYING WITH THE
20:17:35  BIKE PARKING REQUIREMENTS IN FREMONT CODE.

20:17:39 AND REALLY MAKE A DEVELOPMENT THAT IS
20:17:43  TRULY BIKE-FRIENDLY.
AND I WILL POINT OUT
20:17:46  ALSO THAT ONE OF THE NICE THINGS ABOUT THIS PLACE IS,
20:17:50  IT IS IN FACT LOCATION-WISE
20:17:53  VERY ACCESSIBLE, BOTH FOR PEDESTRIANS AND
20:17:57  BICYCLISTS.
YOU CAN WALK TO
20:18:00  BROOKVALE SHOPPING CENTER, THERE IS A
20:18:03  7-ELEVEN JUST AROUND THE CORNER, THERE IS A DRUGSTORE
20:18:06  JUST ACROSS THE CORNER.
FOR ACTIVITIES OF JUST
20:18:10  NORMAL DAILY LIVING, THIS IS A GREAT LOCATION.
WHERE
20:18:13  YOU DON'T NEED A LOT OF VEHICLE PARKING IN MY
20:18:16  VIEW.
AND THERE'S ACTUALLY
20:18:20  NOW EXCELLENT BIKE ACCESS ALSO ON FREMONT BOULEVARD AND
20:18:23  THERE'S EVEN BETTER BIKE ACCESS COMING ON
20:18:27  DECOTO
20:18:30  ROAD WITHIN A COUPLE OF YEARS.
WE HOPE THIS GETS
20:18:33  APPROVED BECAUSE WE REALLY NEED MORE RESIDENCES LIKE THIS THAT
20:18:36  DO ACCOMMODATE ALTERNATIVE MODES
20:18:39  OF TRANSPORTATION.
THANK YOU.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   THANK YOU 
20:18:42 SIR.
IF THERE IS NO FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT TRISH?
20:18:46 
>> LET ME TAKE A LOOK.
I'M JUST WAITING FOR THE CLOCK
20:18:49  TO BE LOWERED.
I'M DOUBLE CHECKING
20:18:52  AND WE DO NOT HAVE ANY MORE SPEAKERS.
THANK YOU
20:18:55 .
>> Commissioner Daulton:   ALL RIGHT THEN IN THAT CASE, I WOULD
20:18:58  LIKE TO OFFER THE APPLICANT FIVE MINUTES TO SPEAK
20:19:03 .
20:19:07 
>> HI, CAN I SPEAK FOR TWO MINUTES?
20:19:10 
>> Commissioner Daulton:   YES,
20:19:14  MR. 
20:19:21  MAST
20:19:24 AN YES.
>> THE BEAUTY
20:19:27  OF FREMONT, WE HAVE ALL LIVED HERE FOR ABOUT 30
20:19:30  YEARS.
WE ARE MOSTLY IN OUR SENIOR YEARS AND
20:19:34  THE REASON WE ARE MAKING THIS
20:19:38  HOUSING PROJECT IS THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO LIVE TOGETHER.

20:19:43 LIVING TOGETHER REDUCE
20:19:46 S EVERYBODY GOING TO THE GROCERY STORE AFTER
20:19:49  SOME OF US ARE 60, 65, 70, 75
20:19:54 , SO WE WILL NOT BE HAVING MULTIPLE
20:19:57  CARS.
BECAUSE THERE ARE TWO ISSUES THAT ARE COMING UP AGAIN
20:20:00  AND AGAIN.
AND THE QUESTIONS THAT NEEDED TO BE
20:20:03  ASKED HAVE NOT BEEN ASKED, WHICH I AM GOING
20:20:07  TO ASK AS A RESTAURANT
20:20:10  OF FREMONT NORTH AS AN OWNER ALONE.
THE
20:20:13  PARKING IS FOR
20:20:16  US.
THERE'S MORE THAN ADEQUATE BECAUSE SOME OF
20:20:19  US EVEN WILL NOT HAVE ANY CARS ON IT
20:20:23 .
THE THINGS LIKE THIS
20:20:26  COMMUNITY CENTER, PEOPLE WHO
20:20:30  PLAY BRIDGE WILL
20:20:33  BE -- JUST LIKE A KITCHEN WITH A TV WITH A
20:20:36  SOFA WITH SITTING SPACE.
TABLES AND CHAIRS
20:20:40  TO PLAY  BRIDGE, OR WHATEVER.

20:20:43 AROUND THE OLDER YOU GET THE LESS TIME YOU
20:20:46  HAVE TO GO OUT AND SIT IN
20:20:49  SOME PLACE.
SO HERE YOU GO DOWN THE
20:20:52  STAIRS OR THE ELEVATOR AND YOU HAVE LIKE A SMALL PLAY
20:20:56  ROOM WHERE YOU CAN SPEND YOUR TIME THERE
20:20:59  WITH PEOPLE YOUR AGE.
NOW, THE QUESTIONS ACTUALLY
20:21:03  HAVE BEEN ASKED BY THE COMMISSIONERS IS, IS THIS
20:21:06  BUILDING ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY?
DOES IT HAVE SOLAR?
DOES
20:21:10  IT HAVE WATER RECYCLING?
DOES
20:21:13  IT HAVE THINGS WHERE
20:21:16 , IF GOD FORBID THERE IS
20:21:19  AN EARTHQUAKE, IS THERE A SAFETY
20:21:22  SITUATION THAT PEOPLE CAN
20:21:26  IMMEDIATELY BE HELPED?
20:21:29 
AND THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT ARE MORE
20:21:32  IMPORTANT.
WILL ALL OF THEM HAVE OUT
20:21:36 LETS FOR EV CARS?
CAN THEY BE
20:21:39  ADDED DOWN THE ROAD?
20:21:46 
S THIS ARE THE QUESTIONS THAT WILL BE IMPORTANT AS TIME GOES
20:21:49  BY AND THE BICYCLE, THE BICYCLE
20:21:52  WE'VE SPENT A LOT OF TIME FOR THIS BICYCLE, THE
20:21:55  ALTERNATIVE METHOD OF TRANSPORTATION, DOES IF
20:21:58  COMBUST STOP
COME -- DOES THE BUS COME THERE
20:22:02 ?
THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT ARE IMPORTANT THAT SHOULD BE ASKED
20:22:05  IF THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO GO JOGGING.
IS
20:22:08  THERE A TRAIL THERE?
20:22:12 
THERE IS THE REGAN NURSERY
20:22:16  RIGHT NEXT TO IT.
THESE ARE THINGS THAT WILL
20:22:20  BECOME RELEVANT AND 90% OF THE CONVERSATION
20:22:23  TODAY WAS, IS THERE ADEQUATE PARK
20:22:26 ING OR ALL ABOUT THE LIFTS
20:22:29 .
FRANCE, BERKELEY, ALL OVER THE WORLD, ALL THE CITIES
20:22:32  ARE UTILIZING THESE LIFTS.
20:22:36 
BECAUSE SPACE IS AN ISSUE IN ALL MAJOR
20:22:39  METROPOLITAN AREAS.
SO YOU GUYS ARE DOING A GOOD
20:22:42   JOB.
APPRECIATE IT.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
20:22:45 .
I'VE SAID WHAT I HAD TO SAY.

20:22:50 >> Commissioner Daulton:   ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU SIR.
IS THAT THEN
20:22:54  THE END OF THE APPLICANT REBUTTAL?
20:22:57 
NOTHING FURTHER THEN
20:23:00 ?
20:23:07 
IF SO I WILL CLOSE THE MILK HEARING AND
20:23:10  ASK THE COMMISSIONERS IF THEY HAVE ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS
20:23:13  OR COMMENTS ON THIS AGENDA ITEM?
SEEING NO
20:23:16  HANDS, I'LL ASK FOR A MOTION.
20:23:20 
20:23:24 .
ANYONE, CAN I GET A MOTION
20:23:29 ?
ALL RIGHT
20:23:32 , COMMISSIONER ZHANG.

20:23:36 >> Commissioner Zhang:   MOTION TO APPROVE PROSPECT.
>> Commissioner Rao:   I SECOND THAT
20:23:40 .
>> Commissioner Daulton:   WE HAVE A MOTION BY COMMISSIONER ZHANG TO
20:23:43  APPROVE AND A SECOND BY VICE CHAIR
20:23:46  RAO.
JOEL WILL YOU CALL THE VOTE
20:23:51 ?
>> Planner Pullen:   YES, BEFORE I DO
20:23:54 , I DO WAND TO REMIND THE COMMISSION OF
20:23:58  YOUR -- OF THE POSITION THIS PROJECT IS IN,
20:24:01  THIS PROJECT IS AN OBJECTIVELY
20:24:05  COMPLIANT PROJECT SO BY STATE LAW PROJECTS THAT
20:24:09 
ARE  SUBJECTIVELY COMPLIANT WITH THE CITY
20:24:13  CODE MUST BE COMPLIANT UNLESS THE COMMISSION SIGNS A
20:24:16  PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE THAT CANNOT BE RESOLVED THROUGH
20:24:20  A MODIFICATION OF THE PROJECT WHICH DOESN'T
EXIST IN THIS
20:24:23  SITUATION.
AND SO I WOULD ENCOURAGE THAT
20:24:26  IF ANYBODY -- I WOULD WANT TO MAKE CLEAR TO THE COMMISSION THAT
20:24:29  IF THE PROJECT WERE NOT TO BE APPROVED, AND THAT WERE
20:24:34  NOT TO BE ARTICULATED
20:24:37 , THAT WOULD PUT THE CITY IN A
DIFFICULT LEGAL POSITION
20:24:41 .
THAT'S THE FACT OF THE SITUATION WE'RE IN
20:24:44 .
SO I'LL CALL THE VOTE ON THE
20:24:47  RECOMMENDATION TO APPROVE.
CHAIRPERSON

20:25:26  IS FINAL UNLESS FEALD TO THE CITY COUNCIL WITHIN
20:25:29  TEN CALENDAR DAYS FROM TONIGHT.
CHAIR
20:25:33  THAT CONCLUDES THIS ITEM.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   ALL RIGHT
20:25:36 , WE ARE GETTING VERY CLOSE TO OUR 8:30 BREAK
20:25:40  TIME BUT MAYBE WE CAN MAKE IT THROUGH THE MEETING IN
20:25:43  TIME FOR US TO SIMPLY
20:25:47  CLOSE OUT.
DOES ANYONE HAVE ANY
20:25:51  DISCUSSION ITEMS FOR THE COMMISSION
20:25:54 ?
JOEL OR ANY OF THE COMMISSIONERS
20:25:57  COMMISSIONERS?
>> Planner Pullen:   I DO HAVE ONE ANNOUNCEMENT.

20:26:01 I JUST WANTED TO NOTE TO THE COMMISSION THAT SOMETHING YOU HEARD
20:26:04  RECENTLY ON A PREVIOUS AGENDA WENT TO COUNCIL
20:26:07  AND THAT'S THE OUTDOOR PATIO
20:26:11 ,  OUTDOOR COMMERCIAL PATIO ORDINANCE.
THAT WAS HEARD
20:26:14  BY COUNCIL ON TUESDAY AND UNANIMOUSLY  APPROVED.
AND SO
20:26:17  WE'LL HAVE A BUNCH OF FOLKS WHO HAVE
20:26:21  THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE THEIR PATIOS MORE
20:26:24  PERMANENT THROUGH END OF THE YEAR USING SOME
20:26:27  REIMBURSEMENT FUNDS FROM THE CITY'S ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
20:26:30  GROUP.
AND THAT WAS A PRETTY POSITIVE
20:26:33  ITEM HEARD BY ALL ON TUESDAY NIGHT.
AND
20:26:37  PROVIDES SOME FLEXIBILITY FOR
20:26:40  IMROWT DOOR USE FOR COMMERCIAL AND RESTAURANT AND OTHER USE
20:26:43 S THAT SHOULD MAKE OUR COMMERCIAL AREAS EVEN
20:26:46  MORE LIKELY.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   ALL RIGHT.
20:26:49 
THANK YOU SECRETARY PULLEN.
SO IF I
20:26:52  HAVE NO OTHER COMMENTS OR DISCUSSIONS FROM THE COMMISSIONER
20:26:55 S OR STAFF, I WOULD LIKE TO ADJOURN
20:26:59  THIS MEETING AT 8:26
20:27:02 .
THANK YOU FOR YOUR  PARTICIPATION.

20:27:10 >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR CHAIRING IT.
>> Commissioner Daulton:
