19:00:49 SO I'D LIKE TO ASK COMMISSIONER MCDONALD IF YOU COULD LEAD US WITH THE 
19:00:56 PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE.

19:01:08 THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND TO THE REPUBLIC FOR WHICH IT STANDS ONE 
19:01:20 NATION UNDER GOD, INDIVISIBLE, WITH LIBERTY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL.

19:01:21 >> Chair Yee: THANK YOU, COMMISSIONER MCDONALD.

19:04:39 SO THIS IS PART OF THE AGENDA WHERE WE DISCUSS ANY DISCLOSURE COMMISSIONERS 
19:04:42 MAY HAVE REGARDING ITEMS ON THE AGENDA.

19:04:45 I'LL START FIRST.
SO FOR THE FIRST AGENDA ITEM, I TOURED 
19:04:49 THE CHAPEL WAY SITE AND I SPOKE TO SEVERAL RESIDENTS IN THE AREA THAT 
19:04:53 WERE PICKING UP THEIR CHILDREN AT THE LOCAL SCHOOL, AND I SPOKE WITH THE 
19:04:57 MANAGER OF THE BRIARWOOD APARTMENTS THAT'S RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET.

19:05:02 THEN FOR THE SECOND AGENDA ITEM, I SPOKE WITH THREE DEVELOPERS TO KIND OF 
19:05:05 GET AN IDEA ABOUT AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND THEIR NEEDS IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO 
19:05:11 DO THAT.
SO I GUESS WE GO RIGHT DOWN THE LINE, 
19:05:16 SINCE VICE CHAIR RAO IS NOT HERE.
COMMISSIONER MCDONALD, ANY 
19:05:18 DISCLOSURES?
>> Chair McDonald: SURE, I ATTENDED

19:06:07 >> Chair Yee: ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU, EVERYBODY.

19:06:11 SO I'M LOOKING -- THERE'S NOTHING ON THE CONSENT CALENDAR, SO WE'RE GOING 
19:06:16 TO GO TO PUBLIC ORAL COMMUNICATIONS.
WE'RE GOING TO OPEN THE PUBLIC ORAL 
19:06:19 COMMUNICATIONS ORGANIZATION OF OUR MEETING.

19:06:23 IF YOU'D LIKE TO SPEAK ABOUT ANYTHING NOT, AND I REPEAT, NOT ON TONIGHT'S 
19:06:27 SCHEDULED ITEMS, PLEASE VIRTUALLY RAISE YOUR HAND NOW, USING THE RAISE HAND 
19:06:30 FEATURE IN ZOOM OR USE STAR NINE IF ON THE PHONE.

19:06:34 AND EACH SPEAKER WILL HAVE -- WELL, IT DEPENDS ON HOW MANY PEOPLE WE'LL 
19:06:39 HAVE.
WE'LL PAUSE FOR A MOMENT AND ASK THE 
19:06:45 RECORDING CLERK, TRISH CORDOVA, IF WE HAVE ANYONE RAISE THEIR HAND FOR ORAL 
19:06:47 COMMUNICATION.
THESE ARE, AGAIN, FOR ANY TOPICS NOT 
19:06:50 ON TONIGHT'S AGENDA.
SO TRISH, DO WE HAVE ANY  SPEAKERS?

19:07:02 >> Ms. Cordova: I HAVE -- WE DON'T HAVE ANY SPEAKERS.

19:07:08 >> Chair Yee: OKAY.
SO THEN WITH THAT, I'LL MOVE ON TO 
19:07:12 OPENING THE PUBLIC HEARING AND MOVE ON TO OUR REGULAR AGENDA ITEMS.

19:07:17 SO WE HAVE TWO AGENDA ITEMS TONIGHT.
SO JOEL, COULD YOU PLEASE READ THE 
19:07:25 FIRST ITEM'S TITLE?
>> Planner Pullen: YES, CHAIR.

19:07:27 GETTING SITUATED HERE.
ALL RIGHT.

19:07:32 SO CHAIR, THE FIRST ITEM ON TONIGHT'S AGENDA, ITEM 1, IS THE CHAPEL WAY 
19:07:34 SCHOOL GENERAL PLAN AMENDMENT SCREENING REQUEST.

19:07:39 THIS ITEM IS TO CONSIDER A GENERAL PLAN AMENDMENT SCREENING REQUEST TO 
19:07:42 AUTHORIZE FORMAL PROCESSING OF A GENERAL PLAN AMENDMENT APPLICATION TO 
19:07:48 CONVERT THE GENERAL PLAN LAND USE DESIGNATION OF A PROPERTY ON CHAPEL 
19:07:52 WAY FROM PUBLIC FACILITY TO URBAN RESIDENTIAL TO FACILITATE THE 
19:07:57 DEVELOPMENT OF TWO PRIVATE SCHOOLS AND TO ALLOW FUTURE HOUSING FOR TEACHERS, 
19:08:00 SENIORS AND OTHER COMMUNITY GROUPS, AND TO CONSIDER A FINDING THAT THE REQUEST 
19:08:04 IS NOT SUBJECT TO THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT PURSUANT TO 
19:08:09 CEQA GUIDELINES 15378 AND THAT IT DOESN'T MEET THE DEFINITION OF A 
19:08:11 PROJECT.
THE RECOMMENDED ACTION TONIGHT IS TO 
19:08:16 EVALUATE THE PROPOSAL AND MAKE A RECOMMENDATION ON WHETHER THE GENERAL 
19:08:18 PLAN AMENDMENT SCREENING SHOULD BE CONSIDERED.

19:08:20 OR A GENERAL PLAN AMENDMENT ITSELF SHOULD BE CONSIDERED.

19:08:26 PROJECT PLANNER IS HERE TONIGHT, HANG ZHOU HAS A PRESENTATION FOR YOU, AFTER 
19:08:29 WHICH THE APPLICANT WILL BE GIVEN 10 MINUTES AS A TEAM TO GIVE A 
19:08:33 PRESENTATION, AND THEN PUBLIC COMMENT AND THEN A REBUTTAL FROM THE APPLICANT 
19:08:43 FOR 3 MINUTES AT THE END.
SO I'LL GIVE THE FLOOR TO HANG TO GIVE 
19:08:51 THE PRESENTATION.
>> GOOD EVENING, COMMISSIONERS.

19:08:56 THE ITEM BEFORE YOU TONIGHT IS A GENERAL PLAN SCREENING REQUEST FOR 
19:09:00 CHAPEL WAY SCHOOL.
BACK IN 2016, THE CITY COUNCIL ADOPTED 
19:09:06 A GENERAL PLAN AMENDMENT SCREENING POLICY WHICH CREATED A PREAPPLICATION 
19:09:11 SCREENING PROCESS FOR GENERAL PLAN THAT RESULTED IN LAND USE CHANGES TO ALLOW 
19:09:15 ADDITIONAL MARKET RATE HOUSING.
THE INTENT OF THE POLICY IS TO PROVIDE 
19:09:19 AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE PLANNING COMMISSION AND THE CITY COUNCIL TO 
19:09:24 SCREEN POTENTIAL GENERAL PLAN AMENDMENT APPLICATIONS AND IDENTIFY THE PROJECTS 
19:09:28 THAT THEY'RE WILLING TO CONSIDER FOR FORMAL REVIEW OR THE ONES THAT HAVE NO 
19:09:33 INTEREST IN PURSUING FURTHER.
THE POLICY MAKES IT VERY CLEAR THAT 
19:09:38 THE GRANT OF AUTHORIZATION BY THE CITY COUNCIL IN NO WAY IMPLIES PROJECT 
19:09:41 APPROVAL.
IT ONLY AUTHORIZES FORMAL PROCESSING 
19:09:44 OF APPLICATIONS WORTHY OF FURTHER CONSIDERATION.

19:09:50 IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE POLICY, STAFF PERFORMED NO ANALYSIS ON THE SCREENING 
19:09:54 REQUEST APPLICATION.
THEREFORE, STAFF IS NOT MAKING ANY 
19:09:57 RECOMMENDATIONS.
THE PLANNING COMMISSION WILL RECOMMEND 
19:10:02 THE CITY COUNCIL TO AUTHORIZE OR NOT TO AUTHORIZE THE FORMAL PROCESSING OF THE 
19:10:07 GENERAL PLAN AMENDMENT APPLICATION.
REQUESTS SHOULD BE EVALUATED BASED ON 
19:10:10 THE POTENTIAL COMMUNITY BENEFITS THAT A PROJECT CAN PROVIDE.

19:10:18 EXAMPLES INCLUDE ADDITIONAL AFFORDABLE HOUSING BEYOND WHAT IS REQUIRED, THE 
19:10:22 DESIECIALITY OF LAND USE CHANGES, SMALLER UNIT SIZES, PROVISION OF 
19:10:26  SUSTAINABILITY MEASURES OR OTHER AMENITIES SERVING THE BROADER 
19:10:33 COMMUNITY.
THE SITE OF CHAPEL WAY SCHOOL IS A 
19:10:35 2-ACRE LOT NEXT TO THE IRVINGTON TOWN CENTER.

19:10:39 THE ONLY ACCESS TO THE SITE IS FROM THE CHAPEL WAY ON THE LEFT.

19:10:43 THE LOT IS SURROUNDED BY A CEMETERY, A CHURCH, A POSTAL OFFICE AND COMMERCIAL 
19:10:46 AND SOME SINGLE-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL USES.

19:10:51 IT FEATURES A FORMAL EDUCATIONAL FACILITY THAT CONSISTS OF 14,000 
19:11:01 SQUARE FOOT BUILDING, 25 SURFACE PARKING SPACES AND OUTDOOR PLAY 
19:11:07 COURTS.
IN OCTOBER 2018, THE ALAMEDA COUNTY 
19:11:12 OFFICE OF EDUCATION'S BOARD CONFIRMED THE SURPLUS STATUS OF THE SUBJECT SITE 
19:11:14 AND AUTHORIZED THE SALES OF THE PROPERTY.

19:11:22 THE SUBJECT SITE IS CURRENTLY DESIGNATED AS PUBLIC FACILITY, WHICH 
19:11:27 GENERALLY APPLIES TO  NON-OPEN SPACE PARCELS OWNED BY PUBLIC AGENCIES TO 
19:11:31 ALLOW THE DEVELOPMENT OF PUBLIC SCHOOLS OR OTHER PUBLIC FACILITIES OR 
19:11:34 UTILITIES.
THE PUBLIC FACILITY LAND USE 
19:11:38 DESIGNATION WAS CREATED IN THE 2011 GENERAL PLAN FOR THE PURPOSE OF 
19:11:43 HIGHLIGHTING PUBLIC FACILITIES AS VITAL PARTS OF THE NEIGHBORHOODS AND 
19:11:46 COMMUNITIES THEY ADJOIN AND ACKNOWLEDGING THEIR PRESENCE AS PART 
19:11:51 OF THE CITY FABRIC.
PRIOR TO THE 2011 GENERAL PLAN, PUBLIC 
19:11:56 FACILITIES WERE ASSIGNED VARIOUS LAND USE DESIGNATIONS TYPICALLY IN 
19:11:58 ALIGNMENT WITH THE CHARACTER OF SURROUNDING LAND USES.

19:12:04 THE 2011 GENERAL PLAN DID NOT ANTICIPATE A PUBLIC FACILITY 
19:12:07 DESIGNATED PROPERTY BEING PRIVATELY OWNED, WHICH IS THE SITUATION THAT HAS 
19:12:13 BEEN CREATED THROUGH THE ALAMEDA COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION SALE OF THE 
19:12:17 SUBJECT PROPERTY.
PRIVATE USE IS ONLY ALLOWED IN PUBLIC 
19:12:23 FACILITY DISTRICT THROUGH JOINT PUBLIC-PRIVATE  PARTNERSHIP, PROVIDED 
19:12:28 SUCH DEVELOPMENT IS CONSISTENT WITH THE GENERAL PLAN POLICIES.

19:12:32 AS THE SCHOOL DISTRICT INTENDS TO SELL THE PROPERTY TO PRIVATE OWNERS, 
19:12:35 REDESIGNATION OF THE SUBJECT SITE WOULD BE REQUIRED FOR ANY FUTURE PRIVATE 
19:12:41  DEVELOPMENT.
THE APPLICANT IS PROPOSING TO CHANGE 
19:12:46 THE LAND USE DESIGNATION OF THIS SITE FROM PUBLIC FACILITY TO URBAN 
19:12:51 RESIDENTIAL, 30 TO 70 UNITS PER ACRE.
THE PROPOSED URBAN RESIDENTIAL 
19:12:56 DESIGNATION WOULD ALLOW THE APPLICANT TO USE THE EXISTING FACILITY FOR TWO 
19:13:00 PRIVATE SCHOOLS SUBJECT TO THE APPROVAL OF A CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT, AND TO 
19:13:04 FACILITATE THE FUTURE  DEVELOPMENT OF A PORTION OF THE SITE WITH TEACHER 
19:13:08 HOUSING AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR SENIORS, AND OTHER COMMUNITY GROUPS 
19:13:13 SUBJECT TO FUTURE ENTITLEMENTS.
IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT A PRIVATE 
19:13:17 SCHOOL USE COULD BE ALLOWED ON THE SITE AS A JOINT PUBLIC-PRIVATE DEVELOPMENT 
19:13:20 UNDER THE SITE'S CURRENT GENERAL PLAN DESIGNATION.

19:13:24 PROVIDED THAT THE SITE IS OWNED BY A PUBLIC AGENCY AND SUBJECT TO THE 
19:13:30 APPROVAL OF A CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT.
AND LAST, STAFF WANTS TO NOTE THAT 
19:13:34 THERE IS NO SPECIFIC PLAN FOR HOUSING DEVELOPMENT OR A CONDITIONAL USE 
19:13:40 PERMIT FOR PRIVATE SCHOOLS UNDER -- THE ITEM BEFORE YOU IS A SCREENING REQUEST 
19:13:44 FOR GENERAL PLAN AMENDMENT, WHICH WOULD AUTHORIZE OR NOT TO AUTHORIZE THE 
19:13:48 APPLICANT TO PROCEED WITH A FORMAL APPLICATION TO CHANGE THE LAND USE 
19:13:51 DESIGNATION FROM PUBLIC FACILITY TO URBAN RESIDENTIAL.

19:13:55 THAT CONCLUDES STAFF'S PRESENTATION, AND STAFF IS READY FOR QUESTIONS.

19:14:05 THANK YOU.
>> Chair Yee: THANK YOU, HANG.

19:14:11 SORRY, I WAS MUTED.
DO WE HAVE ANY CLARIFYING QUESTIONS 
19:14:14 FROM THE COMMISSION THAT WANTED TO ASK HANG ABOUT HER PRESENTATION?

19:14:26 TRISH, IS THERE ANY WAY YOU CAN GET THIS SCREEN BACK TO THE -- WITH ALL 
19:14:29 THE TILES FOR ME TO SEE WHO MAY HAVE RAISED THEIR HAND FROM THE 
19:14:36 COMMISSION?
OH, GOOD.

19:14:40 I SEE A HAND RAISED NOW.
COMMISSIONER MCDONALD, YOU HAVE A 
19:14:43 CLARIFYING QUESTION BASED ON THE INFORMATION THAT WAS JUST PRESENTED?

19:14:53 YOU'RE MUTED.
>> Chair McDonald: SORRY ABOUT THAT.

19:14:56 I'M TRYING TO STAY QUIET.
OKAY.

19:15:01 I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS A PRIVATE SCHOOL CURRENTLY ON SITE AND IT IS A 
19:15:05 JOINT VENTURE AND THAT IS WHY THEY'RE ALLOWED TO EXIST.

19:15:07 IS THAT TRUE?
OKAY.

19:15:11 SO MY QUESTION IS, I GUESS IT'S IN TWO PARTS.

19:15:20 ONE, IS THERE NO GRANDFATHER CLAUSE OR ANY CPU WHICH CAN GIVE THE SCHOOL IN 
19:15:22 ORDER TO LET THEM CONTINUE TO OPERATE AS THEY ARE?

19:15:30 THE FACT THAT THEY ARE ALREADY ON SITE?

19:15:35 >> NO, WHAT IT IS, THE SITE IS CURRENTLY OWNED BY ALAMEDA COUNTY 
19:15:39 OFFICE OF EDUCATION, WHICH IS A PUBLIC ENTITY, AND THE SITE IS -- THEREFORE, 
19:15:44 THE SITE IS DESIGNATED AS PUBLIC FACILITIES, BUT SINCE THE SCHOOL 
19:15:52 INTENDS TO SELL THE PROPERTY TO PRIVATE OWNERS, PUBLIC FACILITY IS NOT AN 
19:15:55 APPROPRIATE DESIGNATION ANYMORE, IT HAS TO BE CHANGED TO ANOTHER DESIGNATION 
19:15:57 TO BE CONSISTENT WITH PRIVATE OWNERSHIP.

19:16:01 SO IN TERMS OF GRANDFATHERING IN, I GUESS THE ANSWER IS NO, THERE'S NO WAY 
19:16:07 THAT WE ALLOW IT WITH OTHER GRANDFATHER IN CLAUSE IN THE ZONING CODE OR THE 
19:16:12 GENERAL PLAN.
>> Chair McDonald: AND THERE'S NO 
19:16:15 CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT WE CAN GIVE THEM TO TEMPORARILY ALLOW THIS TO OCCUR ON 
19:16:20 SITE?
>> SO THE ONLY WAY TO ALLOW THEM TO 
19:16:26 OPERATE, TO KEEP OPERATING LIKE THAT IS TO FORM A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THEM AND 
19:16:29 THE SCHOOL DISTRICT AS A  PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP AND WE 
19:16:33 WOULD GRANT THEM SUCH A USE UNDER CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT, BUT THAT WOULD 
19:16:37 BE A DECISION BASED FOR THE SCHOOL DISTRICT TO DECIDE IF THEY WANT TO 
19:16:43 KEEP THE OWNERSHIP OF THE SITE AND WANT TO FORM A PARTNERSHIP WITH THE 
19:16:48 APPLICANT.
>> Chair McDonald: I'M SORRY, I'M A 
19:16:52 LITTLE CONFUSED.
SO THE SITE IS ACTUALLY OWNED BY 
19:16:56 ALAMEDA COUNTY OR FUSD?
I'M NOT SURE WHO OWNS THE SITE.

19:16:58 >> Planner Pullen: CAN I JUMP IN HERE, HANG?

19:17:04 I JUST WANT TO BE -- I WANT TO STEP BACK A LITTLE BIT AND EXPLAIN WHERE 
19:17:06 WE'RE COMING FROM.
TO ANSWER YOUR FOLLOW-UP QUESTION, 
19:17:10 IT'S OWNED BY THE ALAMEDA COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION AS OPPOSED TO FREMONT 
19:17:14 UNIFIED.
ALAMEDA COUNTY IS SORT OF THE UMBRELLA 
19:17:16 SCHOOL ORGANIZATION FOR ALAMEDA COUNTY.

19:17:21 THEY HAVE A SUPERINTENDENT AND BOARD, BUT THEY'RE SEPARATE FROM FUSD.

19:17:28 BUT I'LL TAKE YOU BACK FOR THE 2011 GENERAL PLAN, LIKE HANG WAS 
19:17:31 MENTIONING, YOU KNOW, THESE SITES -- IN HER PRESENTATION.

19:17:36 THESE SITES, FOR FREMONT  UNIFIED, FOR AC OFFICE OF EDUCATION, FOR OTHER 
19:17:42 PUBLIC ENTITIES OFTEN HAD A LAND USE DESIGNATION THAT HAD BEEN THERE FOR 
19:17:47 SOME TIME, BUT DIDN'T NECESSARILY REFLECT THE VISION THE CITY HAD FOR 
19:17:51 THE AREA WHICH WAS EVOLVING AS WE BECAME MORE SORT OF STRATEGICALLY 
19:17:57 URBAN.
SO WE PURPOSELY TOOK THOSE SITES AND 
19:18:00 PUT THE PUBLIC FACILITY DESIGNATION SO THE CITY WOULD HAVE THE PURVIEW TO 
19:18:03 DETERMINE WHAT THE FUTURE USE OF THAT SITE WOULD BE, SHOULD IT EVER STOP 
19:18:10 BEING A PUBLICLY OWNED SITE.
SO THAT WAS AN INTENTIONAL DECISION WE 
19:18:13 MADE SO THAT WE WOULD HAVE THE LAND USE CONTROL OF THE SITE AFTER THAT, SO 
19:18:18 THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF THAT HAPPENING WHERE THE SCHOOL OFFICE OF EDUCATION, 
19:18:21 ALAMEDA COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT, IS SELLING THE SITE AND SO SINCE IT'S 
19:18:26 GOING FROM PUBLIC OWNERSHIP TO PRIVATE OWNERSHIP, THAT CREATES THE NEED TO 
19:18:29 MAKE A DECISION ABOUT WHAT THE USE OF THE SITE WOULD BE.

19:18:37 NOW, OUR POLICY, THE SCREENING POLICY SORT OF OVERLAYS THAT AND SAYS, WELL, 
19:18:41 IF IT'S GOING TO GO TO ANYTHING THAT WOULD ALLOW RESIDENTIAL USES WITH SOME 
19:18:46 SMALL EXCEPTIONS, THEN WE HAVE TO DO THE SCREENING POLICY IN ADDITION TO A 
19:18:53 GENERAL PLAN AMENDMENT NORMAL PROCESS.
SO WHEN WE SET UP THE GENERAL PLAN 
19:18:58 DESIGNATION OF PUBLIC FACILITY, WE ALSO REALIZED THAT PUBLIC ENTITIES MAY WANT 
19:19:04 TO HAVE A SITE THAT HAD -- THAT WAS INITIALLY BUILT MAYBE FOR A SCHOOL OR 
19:19:09 MAYBE INITIALLY BUILT FOR A PUBLIC FACILITY OF SOME KIND BE USED WHILE IT 
19:19:14 WASN'T NECESSARY FOR THEIR AGENCY'S PURPOSE BY ANOTHER ENTITY, SUCH AS A 
19:19:19 GOOD EXAMPLE IS FREMONT UNIFIED LEASING ONE OF THEIR SCHOOL SITE TO A PRIVATE 
19:19:22 SCHOOL.
IF THEY DO THAT, THEN THAT REQUIRES A 
19:19:28 USE PERMIT, WHICH WE DID IN THE CASE OF THE PREVIOUS SCHOOL, THE SENECA CENTER 
19:19:32 WHEN THEY CAME THROUGH AND PROPOSED THAT PRIVATE USE, AND SO LONG AS THE 
19:19:39 PUBLIC ENTITY OWNS IT, THE CITY IS FINE WITH AND HAS A PROCESS FOR REVIEWING A 
19:19:44 LEASED PRIVATE FACILITY IN THAT LOCATION, AND THEN THE PUBLIC FACILITY 
19:19:49 MAY CHOOSE TO UNWIND THAT APPROVAL AND GO BACK TO USING IT FOR SOME PUBLIC 
19:19:51  PURPOSE.
AND THAT'S OKAY TOO, THAT'S PART OF 
19:19:56 THEIR MISSION.
BUT THE PUBLIC FACILITY DESIGNATION AT 
19:20:00 ITS FACE IS MEANT FOR A PUBLIC ENTITY, AND IF THAT PUBLIC ENTITY CEASES TO 
19:20:05 OWN IT AND NEEDS TO GO TO SOMETHING THAT WE PLANNED FOR IN THE LONG TERM 
19:20:07 WHICH IS A DIFFERENT GENERAL PLAN DESIGNATION.

19:20:13 I HOPE THAT HELPS A LITTLE BIT FOR BACKGROUND.

19:20:15 >> Chair McDonald: I HOPE SO.
IT ALSO RAISES ONE MORE QUESTION FOR 
19:20:17 ME.
SO SAY THEY DON'T GET THE GENERAL PLAN 
19:20:26 AMENDMENT CHANGE AND WE DON'T APPROVE THE -- IF THE ZONING DOESN'T CHANGE, 
19:20:29 WHAT HAPPENS?
DOES THAT MEAN THAT THE CITY -- OR THE 
19:20:33 COUNTY CAN'T SELL THE PROPERTY TO A PRIVATE OWNER OR WHAT HAPPENS?

19:20:37 WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
>> Planner Pullen: WELL, I THINK THAT 
19:20:40 THERE ARE A VARIETY OF POSSIBLE DESIGNATIONS.

19:20:44 SOME OF THEM INCLUDE HOUSING, SOME OF THEM INCLUDE OTHER DESIGNATIONS AND I 
19:20:53 THINK THAT WE HAVEN'T HAD A PUBLIC FACILITY BE SOLD, I DON'T THINK, AND 
19:20:59 GONE THROUGH THIS PROCESS, THIS SCREENING PROCESS, SO THIS IS THE 
19:21:04 FIRST CASE FOR THAT.
BUT I THINK THAT, YOU KNOW, THERE ARE 
19:21:07 SOME DESIGNATIONS THAT WOULD BE FEASIBLE TO SUBMIT THE GENERAL PLAN 
19:21:11 AMENDMENT PROCESS JUST OUTRIGHT IF THEY DIDN'T INCLUDE HOUSING.

19:21:17 THE HOUSING WOULDN'T REQUIRE THIS FIRST PROCESS.

19:21:20 >> Chair McDonald: I GUESS MY QUESTION HERE IS THAT IN PREVIOUS SESSIONS 
19:21:26 WE'VE HAD, YOU'VE SHOWN SERIOUS CONCERN ABOUT ZONING ONE LOT OFF AT A TIME, OR 
19:21:28 MAKING GENERAL PLAN AMENDMENTS LOT BY LOT.

19:21:36 I REMEMBER SPECIFICALLY WHEN WE LOOKED AT THE LOT ON FREMONT BOULEVARD WHERE 
19:21:44 THE CONDOMINIUM COMPLEX -- I THINK IT WAS 13 UNITS, WAS LOOKING THAT IT HAD 
19:21:47 TO BE A PARTICULAR WAY AND I REMEMBER AT THAT POINT THE COUNCIL ACTUALLY OR 
19:21:54 THE COMMISSION WANTED TO INCREASE THE DENSITY BECAUSE IT WAS IN THE TOD 
19:21:58 OVERLAY OR SOMETHING AND WE WERE LOOKING FOR A LITTLE BIT HIGHER 
19:22:03 DENSITY AND WE DIDN'T WANT TO CHANGE THE ZONING ON THAT ONE LOT.

19:22:09 AND I REMEMBER ALSO THIS HAPPENING ONE OTHER TIME AND I'M SORRY, I CAN'T 
19:22:13 REMEMBER THE NAME OF THE PROPERTY, BUT I KNOW THAT CHANGING THE ZONING ON A 
19:22:19 SINGLE LOT HAS COME UP MULTIPLE TIMES AND THEN DISCOURAGED.

19:22:26 SO THIS ONE TIME, I'M WONDERING WHY WE ARE LOOKING TO -- ESPECIALLY ADD URBAN 
19:22:33 DENSITY TO THIS LOT THAT'S NEVER HAD HOUSING ON IT BEFORE.

19:22:37 >> Planner Pullen: SO THE GENERAL PLAN AMENDMENT PROCESS EXISTS AFTER YOU DO 
19:22:42 THE COMPREHENSIVE UPDATE THAT WE DID IN 2011, OR A HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATE.

19:22:49 THE GENERAL PLAN PROCESS ALLOWS AMENDMENTS ON A ONE-OFF BASIS, AND 
19:22:53 THERE ARE REASONS SOMETIMES TO DO A PARTICULAR SITE AS OPPOSED TO A 
19:22:57 BROADER SITE.
THE DETAILS OF ANY ONE GENERAL PLAN 
19:23:04 AMENDMENT IS GOING TO BE -- ARE GOING TO BE FLESHED OUT WITH THAT 
19:23:07 APPLICATION, SUCH AS THE APPROPRIATENESS TO YOUR POINT OF ITS 
19:23:11 SURROUNDINGS AND THE DESIGNATION BEING CHOSEN.

19:23:16 THE TASK BEFORE THE COMMISSION TONIGHT IS REALLY TO LOOK AT THAT SCREENING 
19:23:24 PROCESS WHICH HAS SIX BULLETS AND OTHER -- AND THESE ARE AMONG THE THINGS YOU 
19:23:32 CAN CONSIDER, THAT GIVEN THOSE POINTS, FOR YOU TO DECIDE WHETHER YOU THINK 
19:23:37 YOU'D BE INTERESTED IN A GENERAL PLAN AMENDMENT PROCESS OR WHETHER YOU DON'T 
19:23:45 THINK IT SHOULD GO  FORWARD.
AND YOU CAN MAKE THAT DECISION BASED 
19:23:52 ON THE MERITS -- THERE IS A LOT OF STUFF WE COULD DELVE INTO, THE 
19:23:53 APPROPRIATENESS OF A SCHOOL, FUTURE USE PERMIT.

19:23:57 THAT'S ALL FOR LATER.
THE ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW, TECHNICAL 
19:23:59 REVIEW.
IT'S A GUT CHECK AT THIS LEVEL.

19:24:04 DO WE WANT THEM TO PROCEED OR DO WE WANT TO SAY NO, WE'RE NOT INTERESTED.

19:24:08 YOU AND THE COUNCIL AFTER YOU.
>> Chair McDonald: OKAY.

19:24:17 AND JUST TO CONFIRM, SO BEHIND THEM IS THE POST OFFICE, AND TO THEIR DUE -- 
19:24:20 IS IT WEST, IS THE CHURCH PROPERTY, I'M NOT SURE.

19:24:24 AND THEN THE CEMETERY.
SO PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING AROUND THEM 
19:24:32 IS ONE STORY AT THIS POINT IN TIME.
AND THOSE --

19:24:35 >> Planner Pullen: YEAH,  SORRY --
>> Chair McDonald: THE POST OFFICE IS 
19:24:39 ANOTHER PUBLIC PROPERTY OR PUBLIC FACILITY, AND THE OTHER ZONES I SEE 
19:24:42 AROUND THERE, I'M NOT SURE -- I DON'T THINK THE CEMETERY HAS THAT KIND OF 
19:24:47 ZONING, BUT THE CHURCH NEXT DOOR IS MEDIUM DENSITY AND PRETTY MUCH 
19:24:50 EVERYTHING I SEE AROUND THE CHURCH IS MEDIUM DENSITY RESIDENTIAL, RIGHT?

19:24:56 >> Planner Pullen: SO THERE WAS A SLIDE IN HANG'S PRESENTATION BUT OPEN SPACE 
19:25:01 IS THE CEMETERY, THE CHURCH IS MEDIUM DENSITY RESIDENTIAL, THIS IS PROPOSED 
19:25:06 FOR URBAN AND THEN IT COMMERCIAL WITH A PLANNED DISTRICT ALONG THE BAY STREET 
19:25:09 FRONTAGE.
I'D CALL THE CHURCH PROBABLY FREMONT 
19:25:16 SOUTH, MAYBE SOUTHEAST.
SO YEAH, THERE'S SOME VARIOUS 
19:25:21 DENSITIES BUT AGAIN, WE WOULD GET INTO ALL THOSE ADJACENCIES AND RELATIVE 
19:25:25 INTENSITIES ALONG WITH THE GENERAL PLAN AMENDMENT PROCESS, SHOULD YOU BE 
19:25:30  INTERESTED AT A GUT LEVEL IN PROCEEDING.

19:25:33 HANG, IS THERE ANY MORE YOU WANT TO SAY ABOUT THE SETTING?

19:25:39 >> NO, I DO WANT TO MENTION THAT YOU'RE RIGHT THAT THE MAJORITY OF THE 
19:25:44 SURROUNDING USES ARE MEDIUM DENSITY RESIDENTIAL, EXCEPT THERE IS ONE SITE 
19:25:48 TO THE SOUTH THAT IS URBAN RESIDENTIAL.

19:25:53 I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THE HISTORY OF THAT, BUT THAT IS FURTHER DOWN TO THE 
19:25:58 SOUTH.
SO THAT'S THE ONLY SPOT IN THIS AREA 
19:26:00 THAT HAD AN URBAN RESIDENTIAL DESIGNATION.

19:26:04 >> Chair McDonald: AND THE CHURCH SITE, I MEAN, GRANTED IT IS DESIGNATED 
19:26:09 MEDIUM DENSITY RESIDENTIAL, BUT THE CHURCH HAS NO INTENTIONS OF SELLING 
19:26:15 AND TURNING IT INTO OTHER THAN CHURCH.
IT BEEN CHURCH FOR OVER A HUNDRED 
19:26:19 YEARS ACTUALLY, THAT SITE.
AND AS FAR AS I KNOW FROM MY 
19:26:23 INTERACTIONS WITH THE CHURCH, THEY HAVE NO PROVISIONS OF SELLING THAT 
19:26:25 PROPERTY.
SO IT'S GOING TO BE ONE STORY CHURCH 
19:26:35 ON A VERY SPARSELY POPULATED LOT.
I'M JUST WONDERING, WHO CAME UP WITH 
19:26:43 OR WHY ARE WE GOING WITH 3070 URBAN DENSITY AS OPPOSED TO GOING MEDIUM 
19:26:49 DENSITY?
>> Chair Yee: COMMISSIONER MCDONALD, 
19:26:52 MAYBE WHEN WE GET TO THE APPLICANT, BECAUSE MAYBE THAT QUESTION IS BETTER 
19:26:57 FOR THE APPLICANT TO ANSWER BECAUSE I THINK THEY'RE THE ONES WHO PROBABLY 
19:26:59 DECIDED WHAT THEY WANTED TO GO -- WHAT ROUTE.

19:27:06 >> Chair McDonald: SO IT'S THE APPLICANT THAT CHOSE THE  DENSITY?

19:27:10 >> Chair Yee: I'M JUST  WONDERING, IS THAT TRUE, JOEL?

19:27:14 >> YES.


19:27:16 >> Chair Yee: THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.
SO MAYBE WHAT WE SHOULD DO IS GO TO 
19:27:20 THE APPLICANT, BECAUSE THEY GET -- THEY HAVE UP TO 10 MINUTES TO BE ABLE TO 
19:27:23 PRESENT THEIR INFORMATION SO WE HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THEIR THOUGHT 
19:27:30 PROCESS OF HOW THEY CAME UP WITH THEIR PLAN TO PRESENT TO US TONIGHT.

19:27:35 SO I KNOW I SEE A NUMBER OF PEOPLE FOR THIS APPLICANT, SO WHO IS GOING TO BE 
19:27:41 THE SPEAKER, AND YOU GET 10 MINUTES.
>> Commissioner Daulton: CHAIR, I HAVE 
19:27:43 SOME QUESTIONS.
I HAVE QUESTIONS FOR STAFF.

19:27:45 MY HAND IS UP HERE.
DO YOU SEE THAT?

19:27:50 CAN YOU SEE MY RAISED HAND HERE?
>> Chair Yee: OH, YOU KNOW, THERE'S SO 
19:27:53 MANY SCREENS GOING ON HERE.
YOU'RE ON THE OTHER SCREEN.

19:27:55 SORRY.
THAT'S WHY I DIDN'T SEE YOU.

19:27:59 >> Commissioner Daulton: OKAY.
>> Chair Yee: LET ME GET YOUR QUESTION 
19:28:01 IN THERE BEFORE WE MOVE ON.
>> Commissioner Daulton: THANK YOU, 
19:28:06 CHAIR.
THIS IS FOR HANG ZHOU.

19:28:12 SO THIS IS SORT OF IN LINE WITH WHAT KATHY WAS ASKING.

19:28:19 SO ARE THERE OTHER ZONINGS BESIDES PUBLIC FACILITY OR URBAN RESIDENTIAL 
19:28:29 THAT WOULD ALLOW THE SCHOOLS TO STILL GO ON OR TO BE DEVELOPED WITH A CUP?

19:28:35 >> ANSWER IS YES.
SO BY BRIEF RESEARCH, I KNOW THAT 
19:28:40 SCHOOLS ARE ALLOWED UNDER A CUP IN THE COMMERCIAL OFFICE, COMMERCIAL 
19:28:43 NEIGHBORHOOD, COMMERCIAL GENERAL, AND TOWN CENTER TRANSIT AREAS.

19:28:52 AND THOSE ARE ALL ALLOWING PRIVATE SCHOOLS, SECONDARY SCHOOLS UNDER A 
19:28:52 CUP.
>> Commissioner Daulton: I SEE.

19:28:57 SO THEY COULD HAVE SELECTED ANY ONE OF HALF A DOZEN DIFFERENT DESIGNATIONS?

19:29:02 >> RIGHT.
BUT THOSE USES WOULD NOT ALLOW 
19:29:08 RESIDENTIAL USES BY RIGHT AS WHAT THEY'RE PROPOSING RIGHT NOW.

19:29:12 SO IF THEY CHOOSE ANY OF THESE COMMERCIAL USES, RESIDENTIAL USES 
19:29:15 COULD ONLY BE ALLOWED AS PART OF A MIXED USE PROJECT.

19:29:21 WITH CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT MOSTLY.


19:29:24 >> Commissioner Daulton: SO A MEDIUM DENSITY ZONING WOULD NOT HAVE DONE 
19:29:26 THAT?
>> ACTUALLY MEDIUM DENSITY RESIDENTIAL 
19:29:28 WOULD DO THE SAME AS URBAN RESIDENTIAL.

19:29:33 I'M TALKING ABOUT THE -- IF THEY CHOOSE ANY OF THE COMMERCIAL USES, COMMERCIAL 
19:29:34 DESIGNATIONS.
>> Commissioner Daulton: I SEE.

19:29:38 BUT THERE ARE OTHER RESIDENTIAL LEVELS THAT THEY COULD HAVE CHOSEN?

19:29:41 >> YES, YES.
>> Commissioner Daulton: OKAY.

19:29:48 AND DOES STAFF HAVE ANY KIND OF POLICY DIRECTING THE ZONING OF SITES WHICH 
19:29:58 ARE SEEMINGLY  BISECTED BY THE TOD LIKE THIS ONE IS?

19:30:01 >> NO, WE DON'T AT THIS POINT.
>> Commissioner Daulton: OKAY.

19:30:03 THAT'S ALL.
THANK YOU.

19:30:09 >> I SHOULD ADD IT IS WITHIN THE TOD AREA FOR IRVINGTON.

19:30:12 I APOLOGIZE FOR THE MASK, I'M IN THE OFFICE, IT'S OUR POLICY.

19:30:16 BUT IT IS WITHIN THE IRVINGTON BART TOD, SO IF THEY WENT WITH URBAN 
19:30:21 RESIDENTIAL, THAT BRINGS IT UP FROM 30 UNITS PER ACRE TO 50 IS THE MINIMUM.

19:30:26 >> Commissioner Daulton: BUT IT'S MY IMPRESSION THAT THAT SITE IS SORT OF 
19:30:29 HALF IN AND HALF OUT.
IS THAT THE CASE?

19:30:33 >> MR. ROTH:  YEAH, I THINK A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN HALF, BUT IT IS WITHIN 
19:30:36 THE URBAN -- OR SORRY -- WITHIN THE TOD AREA.

19:30:39 >> Commissioner Daulton: THAT'S WHY I WAS ASKING, IS THERE A POLICY 
19:30:44 REGARDING A SITE THAT IS BISECTED BY THE TOD AREA?

19:30:50 >> MR. ROTH:  I DON'T KNOW THAT WE'VE GOT A WRITTEN POLICY, BUT I THINK THE 
19:30:54 MAJORITY OF IT IS WITHIN THE TOD AND I THINK IF IT FITS WITHIN THE CHARACTER 
19:30:56 OF  TOD, THEN YOU'D PUT IT WITHIN THAT.

19:31:01 IT'S NOT ONE OF THOSE SITUATIONS WHERE, YOU KNOW, IN TERMS OF WALKING 
19:31:04 DISTANCE, IT WOULD BE OUT OF CHARACTER TO CONSIDER IT WITHIN THE TOD.

19:31:08 IT'S RIGHT THERE NEAR BAY  STREET, WHICH IS CERTAINLY AN AREA THAT WE'D 
19:31:11 CONSIDER TO BE WITHIN THE TOD.
>> Commissioner Daulton: OKAY.

19:31:13 THANK YOU.
>> Chair Yee: ALL RIGHT.

19:31:20 >> Planner Pullen: COMMISSIONER DAULTON, SORRY ABOUT THAT, CHAIR YEE.

19:31:24 I WAS TRYING TO APPEND TO HANG'S ANSWER A LITTLE EARLIER AND I DIDN'T REALIZE 
19:31:28 I WAS ON MUTE ON ONE OF MY SCREENS HERE.

19:31:34 SO JUST TO CLARIFY AGAIN, THIS IS -- THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE A PROCESS WHERE 
19:31:38 WE DON'T DO ANALYSIS, BUT WE TREAD THE LINE A LITTLE BIT WHEN IT COMES TO, 
19:31:43 FOR EXAMPLE, THE APPLICANT STATING, YOU KNOW, WHAT THEIR DESIRE IS.

19:31:49 I THINK THAT THE WAY THEY  ARRIVED AT THE URBAN RESIDENTIAL INCLUDED SOME 
19:31:54 DISCUSSION EARLY ON ABOUT SOME LAND USE CATEGORIES THAT WERE INCOMPATIBLE.

19:32:01 YOU KNOW, SO FOR EXAMPLE, WITHIN THE RING OF THE TOD, THERE ARE SOME TYPES 
19:32:05 OF COMMERCIAL THAT WOULDN'T BE APPROPRIATE BASED ON OTHER LAND USE 
19:32:11 POLICIES AND SO WHILE WE WANT TO PACKAGE THE INFORMATION FOR YOU AND 
19:32:16 GIVE TO YOU, WE HAVE TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT OF KIND OF, YOU KNOW, 
19:32:19 INFORMATION ON THE EDGES JUST TO SORT OF GUIDE WHERE THE CONVERSATION COULD 
19:32:24 POSSIBLY GO.
IF THEY WANTED TO MAKE THIS REGIONAL 
19:32:28 COMMERCIAL, FOR  EXAMPLE, THERE WOULD BE NO WAY TO DO THAT IN A TOWN CENTER, 
19:32:30 RIGHT?
IT DOESN'T MEET THE STANDARD.

19:32:35 SO JUST TO BE CLEAR, THERE WAS A DISCUSSION BEFOREHAND AND THE DESIRE 
19:32:39 WAS TO ALLOW RESIDENTIAL AND TO ALLOW THE SCHOOLS AND THAT'S WHERE WE GOT.

19:32:45 >> Commissioner Daulton: THANK YOU, JOEL.

19:32:47 >> Chair Yee: ALL RIGHT.
SO I'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THE 
19:32:50 APPLICANT TO BE ABLE TO DO THEIR PRESENTATION.

19:32:54 FOR 10 MINUTES.
THEN WE'LL BE ABLE TO ASK THEM 
19:33:01 QUESTIONS.
SO WHO IS THE APPLICANT THAT'S GOING 
19:33:20 TO DO THE SPEAKING?
>> Planner Pullen: CHAIR, I BELIEVE 
19:33:35 THAT SALIM AND AMIN ARE HERE FROM THE APPLICANT TEAM.

19:33:37 >> Chair Yee: YOU'VE GOT 10 MINUTES TO DO YOUR PRESENTATION.

19:33:43 >> CHAIR YEE, THIS IS AMIN, THE CONSULTANT.

19:33:47 ACTUALLY AKBER IS GOING TO PRESENT.
HE WAS ACTUALLY TALKING BUT I COULDN'T 
19:33:50 HEAR HIM.
SO AKBER, COULD YOU TRY TO ADJUST YOUR 
19:33:58 MIC, SEE IF YOU CAN CONNECT?
>> HE HAS THE PRESENTATION ON THE 
19:34:03 SCREEN.
>> RIGHT, RIGHT, BUT AKBAR WAS GOING 
19:34:06 TO SPEAK TO IT, AND I'M NOT HEARING HIS VOICE.

19:34:13 I KNOW HE'S ON.
>> Chair Yee: MARIA, TRISH, ARE WE 
19:34:22 ABLE TO GET THE PERSON CONNECTED?
>> THE PERSON'S NAME?

19:34:29 >> AKBER, A, K, B, E, R.
>> HE THAT'S NOT MUTED.

19:34:35 >> I'M LOOKING AT IT ALSO, CHAIR YEE.
HE'S NOT MUTED, HE HAS THE ABILITY TO 
19:34:36 SPEAK.
>> OKAY.

19:34:38 WHILE YOU'RE CONNECTING HIM, I WILL TAKE THE MIC.

19:34:41 THIS IS SALIM.
HI, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.

19:34:44 HOW ARE YOU?
CAN YOU HEAR ME?

19:34:45 >> Chair Yee: YES.
>> OKAY.

19:34:51 WONDERFUL.
I'VE BEEN LIVING IN FREMONT FOR 43 
19:34:57 YEARS, AND WE HAVE ABOUT 500 MEMBERS OF MY FAMILY LIVING HERE AND ABOUT -- 
19:35:05 I'VE BEEN INVOLVED WITH TWO SCHOOLS, ONE ON ELBRAY AND ONE ON LOWRY.

19:35:09 WE HAVE ABOUT 500 KIDS GOING FROM KINDERGARTEN TO 8 AND THEN WE HAVE A 
19:35:17 HIGH SCHOOL WHICH LOST ITS LEASE AND ARE NOW TAKING TEMPORARY FACILITY IN 
19:35:20 OHLONE COLLEGE.
WHEN THIS PROPERTY CAME UP ON THE 
19:35:27 MARKET, WE WANTED TO GET IT AND AS A MATTER OF FACT, WE WILL BE REQUESTING 
19:35:32 THE CITY COUNCIL TO GIVE US AN EMERGENCY CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT SO 
19:35:37 THAT WE CAN START OUR HIGH SCHOOL, WHICH IS RIGHT NOW IN OHLONE COLLEGE 
19:35:41 ON A TEMPORARY BASIS TO START THE SCHOOL.

19:35:49 WE HAVE THE TWO SCHOOLS WITH 500 KIDS FROM KINDERGARTEN THROUGH 8 NEED A 
19:35:51 HIGH SCHOOL.
THERE ARE TWO SCHOOLS ON CHAPEL WAY.

19:36:00 ONE IS HORNER AND ONE IS HIRSCH, AND THIS IS THE SAME ROAD THAT THE SCHOOL 
19:36:03 IS.
THIS BUILDING WAS A SCHOOL BUILDING, 
19:36:11 IT IS A READY TO USE SCHOOL BUILDING.
I DON'T KNOW WHY HOUSING AND ALL OF 
19:36:16 THAT IS BECOMING THE TECHNICAL ISSUE FOR THIS.

19:36:22 PEOPLE ARE MOVING OUT OF FREMONT, GOING TO PLEASANTON, DUBLIN AND ALL OF THAT 
19:36:26 BECAUSE THERE'S A SHORTAGE OF SCHOOL.S IN FREMONT.

19:36:30 THERE IS A SHORTAGE OF QUALITY SCHOOLS IN FREMONT.

19:36:37 OUR KIDS IN OUR COMMUNITY, WE HAVE NEARLY 800 KIDS GOING THROUGH OUR 
19:36:44 SCHOOL SYSTEMS.
THIS PROPERTY CAN BE -- THE COUNTY HAS 
19:36:49 THE SURPLUS, THEY WANT TO SELL.
WE WANT TO BUY, WE ARE PROPOSING TO 
19:37:00 PUT UP A SCHOOL STARTING FIRST WEEK OF SEPTEMBER, WE TESTED WITH THE AIE 
19:37:01 CONSULTING ENGINEERS, ALONG WITH THE SCHOOLS.

19:37:08 WE NEED THE PLACE SO THAT WE CAN TAKE CARE OF THE HOMELESS PEOPLE OF 
19:37:11 FREMONT.
THERE'S 606 PEOPLE WE HAVE BEEN 
19:37:15 SUPPLYING OUR FOOD TO THEM EVERY DAY, THE CHURCH NEXT TO US, WE HAVE BEEN 
19:37:22 TENANTS, WE HAVE ISLAMIC CENTER ON IRVINGTON, AND WE HAVE BEEN TENANTS OF 
19:37:30 THE CHURCH FOR 23 YEARS.
ALL OF THESE THINGS, PLUS TEACHERS 
19:37:38 THAT ARE GOING OUT TO TRACY, STOCKTON, AWAY BECAUSE OF THE HIGH COST OF 
19:37:43 HOUSING, SO WE WANT TO DO THREE SCHOOLS HERE, WE WANT TO HAVE A KITCHEN AND A 
19:37:48 PLACE WHERE WE CAN -- RIGHT NOW WITH THE FOOD THAT WE ARE  BUYING, IT COSTS 
19:37:53 US A LOT OF MONEY.
WE ARE SUPPLYING FOOD TO THE ISLANDER 
19:37:58 MOTEL, THEN THE MOTEL ON MISSION BOULEVARD, AND A LOT OF HOMELESS 
19:38:00 PEOPLE OUT THERE.
WE DON'T TAKE MONEY FROM THE COUNTY, 
19:38:13 THE CITY OR ANYBODY.
SO WE HAVE ALL PEOPLE, WE HAVE PEOPLE 
19:38:17 WITH LESS INCOMES, SO THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT WE ARE PLANNING TO DO 
19:38:23 HERE.
AND THIS -- DISTRICT OR THIS 
19:38:28 DEVELOPMENT, ALL OF THAT IS IMPORTANT.
IT IS VERY IMPORTANT BUT THE STEP ONE 
19:38:35 IS TO GET A GENERAL PLAN A AMENDMENT.
THIS PROPERTY WAS OWNED BY ALAMEDA 
19:38:36 COUNTY.
THEY WANTED TO SELL IT AND WE WANT TO 
19:38:40 BUY IT.
AND THESE ARE THE REASONS, OLD PEOPLE 
19:38:47 HOME, RETIRED, THREE SCHOOLS, FEEDING THE HOMELESS, WORKING WITH THE CHURCH 
19:38:51 NEXT DOOR.
WE HAVE BEEN PARKING IN THE CHURCH FOR 
19:38:56 23 YEARS.
WE HAVE A SMALL MOSQUE RIGHT ACROSS 
19:39:02 JACK-IN-THE-BOX NEXT TO STARBUCKS.
SO WITH ALL OF THESE THINGS GOING ON, 
19:39:09 WE WANT YOU PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND THAT WHAT IS IMPORTANT FOR THE COMMUNITY IS 
19:39:17 MORE SCHOOLS, PEOPLE WHO HAVE A RECORD OF DOING THINGS FOR THE COMMUNITY, 
19:39:25 PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN INVOLVED, I MEAN, I'M JUST GOING TO GO OF OFF -- ON THE 
19:39:30 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF FREMONT, I WAS DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE TO RAISE THE 
19:39:37 MONEY FOR THAT EVENT WITH BOB WASSERMAN AND SUE CHAN, EVERYBODY.

19:39:41 SO IF IT WOULD NOT BE THIS IMPORTANT FOR OUR COMMUNITY, AND I DON'T MEAN 
19:39:47 JUST MY COMMUNITY, THE WHOLE OF FREMONT COMMUNITY, WE NEED TO HAVE MORE 
19:39:55 SCHOOLS, LOW INCOME HOUSING, WE NEED TO HAVE PEOPLE WHO WILL TAKE CARE OF OUR 
19:40:00 606 HOMELESS PEOPLE THAT ARE THERE.
I MEAN, IF YOU GO ON YOUTUBE OR 
19:40:03 FACEBOOK, TYPE MY NAME, YOU WILL SEE WHAT PEOPLE ARE GOING THROUGH.

19:40:10 THIS IS THE REASON WE CAME UP WITH THIS PLAN TO HAVE THIS PLACE WHERE WE CAN 
19:40:19 DO ALL OF THESE THINGS.
IF AKBER IS HERE, HE CAN TELL YOU 
19:40:21 ABOUT OUR BACKGROUND -- I GUESS HE'S NOT THERE.

19:40:28 SO ALL THE CITY PLANNING DEPARTMENT, THE CITY COUNCIL, THE FIRE DEPARTMENT, 
19:40:32 POLICE DEPARTMENT, EVEN WITH THE PARADISE FIRE, WE HAVE BEEN WORKING 
19:40:41 WITH THEM FOR OVER THE YEARS.
SO IT IS NOT JUST SOME DEPARTMENT OR 
19:40:46 THIS, IT IS OUR WHOLE COMMUNITY THAT IS INVOLVED IN THIS PROJECT, AND THAT IS 
19:40:54 WHAT WE WANT TO MAKE IT, THAT ANYBODY WHO NEEDS A HOUSE OR NEEDS FOOD, A HOT 
19:40:58 PLATE, OR THE KIDS NEED TO GO TO SCHOOL, WE HAVE NOT TAKEN 1 DOLLAR 
19:41:04 FROM ANY GOVERNMENT AGENCY FOR THE LAST 45 YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN HERE.

19:41:11 SO IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, PLEASE GO AHEAD AND YOU CAN ASK, IF ANYBODY ELSE 
19:41:14 WANTS TO SPEAK, I WILL JUST KEEP QUIET NOW.

19:41:22 >> I WAS WONDERING IF HE COULD SPEAK --

19:41:26 >> Chair Yee: YOU STILL HAVE SOME TIME, YES, ABOUT 3 MINUTES 15 SECONDS.

19:41:36 >> THANK YOU, COMMISSIONER.
>> GO AHEAD.

19:41:40 TELL THEM ABOUT THE SCHOOLS AND THE KIDS AND THE BOOKS THAT WE ARE 
19:41:41 PUBLISHING THAT GOES TO ALL THE LIBRARIES.

19:41:43 GO AHEAD IF YOU'RE NOT ON THEN I WILL CONTINUE.

19:41:53 AND IF THE SCHOOL KIDS, OUR SCHOOL -- ONE OF OUR SCHOOL KIDS BECAME THE CITY 
19:41:58 COUNCILMEMBER AT THE AGE OF 23 FOR SUNNYVALE CITY COUNCIL.

19:42:03 SO THIS IS -- AND THE KIDS THAT HAVE GRADUATED ARE GOING TO BERKELEY AND TO 
19:42:13 MIT, TO UCLA, ALL THE TOP UNIVERSITIES OF OUR COUNTRY, AND THESE ARE PEOPLE 
19:42:17 -- THESE ARE KIDS OF FREMONT.
YOU SHOULD BE GLAD TO KNOW THIS, THAT 
19:42:22 THE FREMONT SCHOOL PRODUCED A KID THAT BECAME A CITY COUNCILMEMBER AT THE AGE 
19:42:29 OF 23, HIS NAME IS ALI.
>> SALIM, I COULD MAYBE GIVE A LITTLE 
19:42:36 BIT BRIEF INTERACTION TO SABA.
SO SABA, COMMISSIONERS, SABA 
19:42:42 ASSOCIATION, SHIA ASSOCIATION OF BAY AREA, SABA, HAS BEEN AROUND SINCE THE 
19:42:47 70s, AND THEY'RE IN THE BAY AREA.
THEY HAVE -- ALL RIGHT HAVE A LOCATION 
19:42:50 IN SAN JOSÉ WHERE THEIR MAIN FACILITY IS.

19:42:54 AND THEY HAVE A LOT OF COMMUNITY MEMBERS WHO LIVE IN FREMONT.

19:42:59 AND THEY ARE ALREADY OPERATING A COUPLE OF SCHOOLS.

19:43:03 ONE OF THE SCHOOLS IS WHAT THEY WANT TO BRANCH OUT IN THIS AREA.

19:43:14 AND AGAIN, UNDER THEIR UMBRELLA, THEY DO HAVE NOT ONLY SCHOOLS BUT THE 
19:43:17 COMMUNITY AND RELIGIOUS FACILITY AS WELL.

19:43:28 SO JUST A HIGH LEVEL ON THAT.
AND I WOULD LIKE TO -- TRISH, THERE 
19:43:32 WAS ANOTHER PRESENTATION THAT SAYS JUSTIFICATION, I COULD PROBABLY 
19:43:35 QUICKLY GO OVER THAT AS WELL, IF WE HAVE A COUPLE OF MINUTES?

19:43:40 >> THERE'S NOT ENOUGH TIME NOW.
YOUR TIME IS OVER.

19:43:44 >> OKAY.
>> CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW?

19:43:47 >> YEAH, AKBER, WE CAN HEAR YOU.
>> OKAY.

19:43:50 I'M SORRY.
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES.

19:43:59 CAN WE START THE CLOCK? AGAIN?
SHOULD I START?

19:44:03 >> MARIA, HIS TIME IS UP, CORRECT?
>> YES.

19:44:06 >> Chair Yee: YEAH.
SORRY ABOUT THAT.

19:44:15 LET'S SEE.
SO I GUESS FOR THE  COMMISSIONERS, DO 
19:44:17 YOU HAVE ANY CLARIFYING QUESTIONS OF THE APPLICANT?

19:44:30 THERE'S SO MANY PEOPLE ON HERE, I CAN'T TELL -- IT MAY BE EASIER IF ANY OF THE 
19:44:34 COMMISSIONER, THEY HAVE A QUESTION, JUST TO SAY YOUR NAME AND LET ME 
19:44:37 KNOW.
>> Commissioner Liu: YES, I DO.

19:44:40 >> Chair Yee: COMMISSIONER LIU?
>> Commissioner Liu: I HAVE A QUESTION 
19:44:44 FOR THE APPLICANT.
SO GOING FORWARD IN THE FUTURE, IF YOU 
19:44:52 ARE GOING TO KEEP OPERATING THE SCHOOL AND BUILD THE HIGH-DENSITY HOUSING, 
19:44:56 AND CAN YOU GIVE US SOME IDEA OR PAINT A PICTURE AS TO HOW YOU'RE GOING TO 
19:45:05 FIT IN 70 OR 140 UNITS ALONG WITH SCHOOLS ON THIS 2-ACRE SITE?

19:45:11 DOES IT MEAN THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE FIVE OR SIX STORY BUILDINGS THERE FOR 
19:45:15 HOUSING?
>> I WOULD LIKE TO ANSWER THIS 
19:45:22 QUESTION, COMMISSIONER.
THE ABODE IS AN ORGANIZATION THAT 
19:45:25 MAKES LOW COST HOUSING, THEY ARE MAKING FOUR COMPLEXES IN FREMONT.

19:45:28 ONE OF THEM IS ON IRVINGTON AND FREMONT BOULEVARD.

19:45:34 THEY HAVE FOUR STORIES AND THE ONE BEHIND JACK-IN-THE-BOX, THEY ARE 
19:45:43 MAKING 94 UNITS ON 1.1-ACRE OF LAND.
THEY ARE ALL IN THE  HIGH-DENSITY, ALL 
19:45:49 OF THESE ARE FUNDED BY THE GOVERNMENT TO MAKE THESE HOUSING.

19:45:55 SO ALL OF THESE HOUSINGS ARE ALREADY BEING BUILT AS WE SPEAK OR HAVE 
19:45:58 ALREADY BEEN BUILT.
SO WE HAVE A 2-ACRE LOT.

19:46:04 WE WANT TO DO THE HOUSING FOR THE COMMUNITY PEOPLE SO THAT THEY BENEFIT 
19:46:10 OUR SCHOOL SYSTEMS.
SO IF YOU TAKE ONE ACRE OF LAND FOR 
19:46:14 THE HOUSING AND ONE ACRE FOR THE SCHOOL, DEPENDING ON HOW BIG A SCHOOL 
19:46:21 WE WANT, HOW MANY KIDS, THE EXAMPLE IS THERE IN FRONT OF YOU OF ABODE, WHICH 
19:46:25 HAS BUILT FOUR COMPLEXES IN THE LAST THREE OR FOUR YEARS.

19:46:34 >> Commissioner Liu: SO IS YOUR PLAN TO HAVE BOTH THE SCHOOL AND HIGH-DENSITY 
19:46:35 HOUSING AT THE SAME TIME IN THE FUTURE?

19:46:42 >> IT DEPENDS ON OUR GROWTH AND OUR REQUIREMENT IF THERE ARE MORE KIDS AND 
19:46:47 MORE JOIN, AND WE CAN HANDLE A BIGGER CAMPUS.

19:46:54 IT WILL ALL DEPEND ON HOW WE GO FORWARD, BUT THE LAND IS  2 ACRES, SO 
19:47:01 EVEN IF WE SPLIT IT, 1-ACRE TO 1-ACRE, RIGHT NOW WE HAVE 14,500 SQUARE FEET 
19:47:07 ON IRVINGTON IN OUR MOSQUE.
SO THIS IS LIKE ABOUT -- IF WE TAKE 
19:47:09 ONE THAT IS FOUR TIMES BIGGER THAN WHAT WE HAVE.

19:47:15 >> Commissioner Liu: OKAY.
SO DOES IT MEAN THAT IN THE FUTURE -- 
19:47:19 I'M ALL IN FAVOR OF BUILDING MORE SCHOOLS AND MAKING SURE THE KIDS HAVE 
19:47:27 PLACES TO GO TO GET EDUCATED.
DO YOU FORESEE A TIME IN THE FUTURE 
19:47:33 WHEN THIS LOT WILL BE KIND OF RESIDENTIAL ONLY OR WILL SCHOOL ALWAYS 
19:47:34 BE THERE?
>> NO, NO.

19:47:42 FOR ME AND OUR COMMUNITY, CHILDREN, KIDS, EDUCATION IS MORE IMPORTANT.

19:47:50 I OPPOSED THE SALE OF THE SCHOOL PROPERTY ABOUT 15, 20 YEARS AGO THAT 
19:47:54 WE SHOULD NOT SELL THE SCHOOL PROPERTIES THAT FREMONT HAD.

19:47:56 BUT AT THAT TIME, NOBODY LISTENED TO ME.

19:48:01 >> Commissioner Liu: OKAY, THANK YOU.
THAT'S ALL THE QUESTIONS I HAVE FOR 
19:48:03 NOW.
>> Commissioner Cardenas: I HAVE A 
19:48:10 QUICK QUESTION, COMMISSIONER CARDENAS.
MR. SALIM, FIRST OF ALL THANKS FOR 
19:48:12 YOUR PRESENTATION.
I APPRECIATE ALL THE WONDERFUL WORK 
19:48:16 THAT YOU DO FOR OUR COMMUNITY.
I REALLY APPRECIATE --

19:48:19 >> NOT FOR ANY PERSONAL GAIN.
THANK GOD.

19:48:21 >> Commissioner Cardenas: REALLY APPRECIATE THAT, AND THAT MAKES A 
19:48:23 POSITIVE DIFFERENCE.
SO THANKS FOR THAT.

19:48:28 YOU KNOW, THE ONE QUESTION I HAVE IS, IT SEEMS LIKE THERE'S SO MANY 
19:48:29 DIFFERENT USES FOR THIS PROPERTY, RIGHT?

19:48:32 YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A SCHOOL, YOU'RE ALSO TALKING ABOUT LIKE FEEDING THE 
19:48:35 HOMELESS.
LOGISTICALLY HOW DOES THAT ALL WORK?

19:48:40 BECAUSE I THINK, YOU KNOW, EVEN WHEN WE WERE DOING THE NAVIGATION CENTER IN 
19:48:45 FREMONT, IT WAS JUST FACED WITH A LOT OF DIFFERENT OPINIONS, RIGHT?

19:48:52 HOW DO YOU HAVE A SCHOOL AND THE HOMELESS COMPONENT EXISTING ALL IN ONE 
19:48:54 AREA?
>> COMMISSIONER, WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

19:48:57 ?
>> Commissioner Cardenas:CARDEN AS.

19:49:01 DANIEL.
>> I OPPOSED THAT CENTER FOR $4.2 
19:49:06 MILLION, 42 BEDS, IT'S NOT THE WAY I WOULD DO IT.

19:49:10 WE ARE FEEDING PEOPLE EVERY DAY, HOT MEALS.

19:49:14 WE COLLECT THE MONEY FROM 543 VOLUNTEERS.

19:49:19 WE GIVE BUSINESSES TO THE LOCAL RESTAURANTS.

19:49:23 $5 A MEAL, WE GET THE MEALS, WE HAVE PEOPLE.

19:49:28 SO RIGHT NOW, SEE, $5 A MEAL, $100, THAT IS 20 MEALS.

19:49:32 IF WE HAVE -- WE HAVE A KITCHEN AND WE HAVE A STOREROOM.

19:49:37 I MEAN, THERE'S ALREADY A PLACE IN THIS PROPERTY THAT THE PREVIOUS SCHOOL 
19:49:41 HAD.
IT IS LIKE A WOODEN, YOU KNOW, WOODEN 
19:49:45 OFFICES, SO WE NEED A PLACE TO STORE -- A LOT OF PEOPLE WANT TO GIVE FOOD.

19:49:49 THEY WANT TO GIVE CANS, THEY WANT TO GIVE VEGETABLES, THEY WANT TO GIVE 
19:49:51 MEAT.
WE HAVE NO PLACE.

19:49:57 WE NEED A PLACE TO PUT THE STUFF THERE, WE NEED A KITCHEN.

19:50:02 SO LIKE THE PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH SELLS BREAKFAST THREE TIMES A WEEK.

19:50:05 OKAY?
THEY COOK THERE, THEY HAVE THE PLACE, 
19:50:10 THEY STORE THE FOOD, AND THEY GIVE IT.
BUT THEY GIVE TO THOSE PEOPLE WHO COME 
19:50:15 TO THE CHURCH.
HOMELESS PEOPLE UNDER WASHINGTON 
19:50:26 BOULEVARD, OR OPPOSITE SEAGATE, YOU KNOW, THE ROAD --  WHATEVER -- OR THE 
19:50:33 ONE ON  ELBERRY WHERE THE JUNK IS COLLECTED.

19:50:40 YOU GO AND YOU GIVE A HOT MEAL TO A HOMELESS PERSON, OKAY, TODAY WE GOT 
19:50:43 THE MEAL FROM A RESTAURANT IN SAN JOSÉ.

19:50:46 THE TRAFFIC BECOMES TERRIBLE.
PEOPLE GO AWAY.

19:50:50 SO HERE WE ARE, 606 HOMELESS PEOPLE ARE LIVING IN FREMONT TODAY.

19:50:57 THEY NEED A PLACE WHERE WE CAN COOK, WHERE WE CAN STORE, THAT EVEN YOU CAN 
19:51:03 COME AND SAY, OKAY, ON SATURDAYS IF YOU COME TO THE ISLANDER MOTEL, WE MAKE 
19:51:10  OMELETTE, BREAD, AND WE SERVE THE PEOPLE, THERE AT ISLANDER MOTEL, 
19:51:13 THERE'S THE OTHER MOTEL, MISSION BOULEVARD, ACROSS OHLONE COLLEGE WHERE 
19:51:19 THERE ARE HOMELESS PEOPLE.
SO YOU DON'T NEED A VERY BIG KITCHEN 
19:51:22 OR A STORAGE ROOM.
WE CAN USE -- IF YOU GO ON GOOGLE MAP 
19:51:28 AND YOU SEE THIS WOODEN OFFICES ON THE LEFT SIDE, THAT THE PREVIOUS SCHOOL 
19:51:32 WAS  USING, WE CAN USE THAT TO STORE THE FOOD, AND WE CAN MAKE A KITCHEN 
19:51:37 WHERE WE CAN COOK.
I'M SORRY, I GOT EMOTIONAL,  OKAY?

19:51:42 PLEASE EXCUSE ME.
>> Chair Yee: NO, I UNDERSTAND.

19:51:46 SO COMMISSIONER CARDENAS, DID HE ANSWER YOUR QUESTION?

19:51:49 >> Commissioner Cardenas: YEAH, THANK YOU, CHAIR.

19:51:52 WE'RE GOOD.
>> Chair Yee: OKAY.

19:51:57 IF THERE AREN'T ANY OTHER QUESTION, I'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO INVITE THE PUBLIC 
19:52:02 TO SPEAK ON THIS AGENDA.
BECAUSE WE STILL HAVE TIME TO STILL 
19:52:04 ASK FURTHER CLARIFYING QUESTIONS LATER.

19:52:09 SO IF THERE ISN'T ANY -- OH.
YEAH, IF THERE ISN'T ANY OTHER 
19:52:14 QUESTIONS, THEN I'M GOING TO -- NOW IS THE TIME FOR -- WE'RE GOING TO TAKE 
19:52:17 PUBLIC COMMENTS.
TRISH, I NEED TO FIND OUT HOW MANY 
19:52:21 PEOPLE HAVE RAISED HANDS THAT WANT TO SPEAK?

19:52:31 >> Ms. Cordova: I HAVE FIVE PEOPLE THAT HAVE RAISED TO  SPEAK.

19:52:36 >> Chair Yee: MARIA, COULD YOU GIVE THEM 2 MINUTES EACH ON THE TIMER?

19:52:41 >> I'LL DO THAT, AND THE FIRST SPEAKER HAS THE EXTENSION OF 1365.

19:52:58 >> HI, THIS IS ALICE CAVETTE.
>> Chair Yee: WE CAN HEAR YOU.

19:53:02 >> I HAVE TWO THINGS TO SAY.
ONE, THE LIVESTREAM OF THE VIDEO IS 
19:53:05 NOT PLAYING SO THIS IS NOT A PUBLIC MEETING.

19:53:19 WE CAN'T SEE IT ON THE VIDEO.
AND TWO, WE WOULD LIKE TO --

19:53:26 >> Planner Pullen: CHAIR, THERE'S A PERSON THAT HAS THEIR MIC ON AND IT'S 
19:53:28 DISRUPTING THE COMMENT.
THANK YOU.

19:53:32 >> Chair Yee: I NEED EVERYBODY TO TURN THEIR MICS OFF, PLEASE.

19:53:36 EXCEPT FOR MS. CAVETTE.
>> CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW?

19:53:38 >> Chair Yee: YES.
OKAY.

19:53:46 LET'S RESET THE CLOCK, MARIA, TO GIVE MS. CAVETTE THE FULL TWO MINUTES.

19:53:52 >> OKAY, I'LL DO THAT.
>> ONE, THE LIVESTREAM VIDEO IS NOT 
19:53:53 PLAYING.
IT HASN'T BEEN ON.

19:54:00 AND SO THIS IS NOT A PUBLIC MEETING.
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH 
19:54:06 GETTING A ZOOM COPY OUT.
BUT TWO, MORE IMPORTANTLY, WE WOULD 
19:54:12 LIKE THE COMMISSION TO CONSIDER AND ASK MORE QUESTIONS AS TO WHY IT'S URBAN 
19:54:17 AND NOT MEDIUM DENSITY.
THEY COULD HAVE HOUSING FOR MEDIUM 
19:54:22 DENSITY ON THE 1-ACRE PART AND STILL CONTINUE TO HAVE THE SCHOOL.

19:54:29 SO WE DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THEY CHOSE URBAN, AND I THINK CHAIRMAN YEE SAID 
19:54:34 WE WOULD BE ASKING THE APPLICANT, BUT THEY DIDN'T ANSWER WHY URBAN.

19:54:36 THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SAY.
THANK YOU.

19:54:41 >> Chair Yee: ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU.
NEXT SPEAKER.

19:54:53 >> Ms. Cordova: I'LL ANNOUNCE THAT THE NEXT SPEAKER IS JARRAR RAZVI.

19:54:57 WE'LL GO AHEAD AND ALLOW YOU TO SPEAK.
GO AHEAD.

19:54:59 >> HI.
THIS IS JARRAR.

19:55:06 GOOD EVENING, EVERYONE.
ONE OF THE MEMBERS, THE APPLICANT FOR 
19:55:10 THIS PROPERTY.
I JUST WAS HEARING AND WAS AMAZED WITH 
19:55:14 THE INFORMATION BEING SHARED.
I WANTED TO BRING TO ATTENTION WHAT 
19:55:20 MR. JOEL MENTIONED, THAT THE ZONING WHEN IT WAS DONE BY THE CITY AT THAT 
19:55:26 POINT IN TIME IN THE PAST, WHAT WE DECIDED  WAS -- I THINK THERE WAS 
19:55:33 INFORMATION THAT WAS EVOLVING SO THAT BY DEFAULT, THEY DESIGNATED THE ZONING 
19:55:37 AS PUBLIC.
SO I THINK WITH THAT, KEEPING THAT IN 
19:55:44 MIND, MY ONLY COMMENT WAS SINCE THIS CONVERSATION TODAY IS MORE LIKE A GUT 
19:55:49 CHECK, AND ALL THE DUE DILIGENCES WILL BE DONE AS WE GO FURTHER ALONG IN THE 
19:56:00 PROCESS, SO I THINK FOR THIS DISCUSSION, I THINK MY COMMENT WAS 
19:56:05 MAYBE THIS IS THE DECISION THAT WAS DONE IN THE PAST, WHICH WAS ON 
19:56:11 INSUFFICIENT DATA, THEN TRYING TO SEE IF WE'RE GOING TO KEEP THAT ZONING 
19:56:18 STILL INTACT FOR PRIVATE -- SORRY -- PUBLIC MAY NOT MAKE AS MUCH SENSE 
19:56:23 UNTIL WE DO FURTHER ASSESSMENT OF IT.
SO THAT WAS MY COMMENT BECAUSE THE 
19:56:28 ZONING SEEMS TO GO EITHER WAY, BASED ON HOW THE CITY HAD APPROACHED IN THE 
19:56:33 PAST.
>> Chair Yee: ALL RIGHT.

19:56:35 THANK YOU.
NEXT SPEAKER?

19:56:42 >> Ms. Cordova: OKAY.
IF YOU CAN LEAR ME, I'M HEARING 
19:56:48  HEAR ME, I'M HEARING THERE'S SOME TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES ON MY END.

19:56:52 >> Chair Yee: YOU SOUND MUFFLED.
>> Ms. Cordova: SORRY ABOUT  THAT.

19:57:00 DO YOU HAVE ANOTHER SPEAKER?
>> Chair McDonald: I'M SORRY, TRISH, I 
19:57:02 COULDN'T UNDERSTAND ANYTHING THAT WAS SAID BY THE LAST SPEAKER.

19:57:06 IS THERE A WAY WE COULD REPLAY THE CLOSED CAPTION OR SOMETHING TO BE ABLE 
19:57:14 TO READ WHAT THE LAST SPEAKER SAID?
>> Ms. Cordova: I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN 
19:57:20 DO THAT AT THIS MOMENT.
>> Chair McDonald: YOU'RE ALSO VERY 
19:57:26 DIFFICULT TO HEAR AS WELL.
>> Ms. Cordova: MARIA, CAN YOU SPEAK?

19:57:29 THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG WITH MY MIC.
I'M TRYING TO FIX IT.

19:57:35 >> YES.
THE NEXT SPEAKER IS  
19:57:37 BERGE-PAPPAS-SMITH CHAPEL.
I'M GOING TO ALLOW YOU TO SPEAK.

19:57:47 YOU'RE UNMUTED SO YOU CAN SPEAK NOW.
>> HI THIS, IS KEVIN SMITH.

19:57:54 I'M WITH BERGE-PAPPAS-SMITH CHAPEL OF THE ANGELS AND CEMETERY.

19:57:58 I'M THE OLDER OF TWO OF THE FIVE OLDEST BUSINESSES IN FREMONT THAT ARE 
19:58:02 NON-RELIGIOUS.
MY MORTUARY GOES BACK TO 1881 AND MY 
19:58:10 CEMETERY HAD ITS FIRST BURIAL IN 1845.
WE HAVE OWNED IT OURSELVES ALMOST 50 
19:58:14 YEARS.
WE HAVE BEEN PRESENT TO SEE BUILDING 
19:58:18 TAKE PLACE ALL AROUND US.
SOME OF IT GOOD, SOME OF IT NOT SO 
19:58:22 GOOD.
OUR BIGGEST CONCERN IS THAT WHEN THE 
19:58:26 SENECA CENTER WENT IN, WE WERE ASSURED THAT IT WOULD BE A SINGLE LEVEL 
19:58:33 BUILDING, IT WOULD HAVE A VERY SMALL USAGE, THE STUDENTS WOULD NOT NUMBER 
19:58:36 VERY MANY AND THE TEACHERS WOULD NOT NUMBER VERY MANY.

19:58:41 WE CURRENTLY OPERATE IRVINGTON MEMORIAL CREMATORY ON THE SITE.

19:58:46 WE DO APPROXIMATELY 6,000 CREMATIONS A YEAR.

19:58:51 OUR STACKS ARE DIRECTLY ACROSS THE STREET FROM THIS FACILITY.

19:58:56 THEY ARE 32 FEET HIGH.
ANYTHING THAT GOES ABOVE ONE STORY 
19:59:00 WILL BE SUBJECT TO OUR STACKS AND WHAT THEY PUT OUT.

19:59:09 IF THIS GOES THROUGH, AND OUR BUSINESS IS AFFECTED, WE WILL HAVE 30 PEOPLE 
19:59:12 THAT HAVE THE POSSIBILITY OF LOSING THEIR JOB AND THERE WILL BE TWO 
19:59:18 BUSINESSES THAT HAVE SERVED THE COMMUNITY FROM NORTH TO SOUTH, EAST TO 
19:59:24 WEST, WILL END UP PROBABLY GOING AWAY.
WHATEVER THE PLANNING COMMISSION 
19:59:30 DECIDES TO PUT IN THIS SPACE, OR ALLOW IN THIS SPACE, YOU NEED TO TAKE INTO 
19:59:34 ACCOUNT THAT WE'VE BEEN THERE A LONG TIME, THAT THERE IS A CREMATORY NOT 
19:59:41 JUST OPEN SPACE CEMETERY.
WE HAVE SERVICES PULLING IN TO THE 
19:59:44 CEMETERY DAILY, TWO, THREE TIMES A DAY.

19:59:49 ANY HIGH-DENSITY WILL AFFECT PARKING, THERE'S NOT ENOUGH PARKING AS IT IS ON 
19:59:53 THE STREET.
WE HAVE PARKING ON OUR CEMETERY SITE.

20:00:01 SO OUR CONCERNS ARE, WHATEVER YOU FOLKS LOOK AT, WHATEVER IS DECIDED, NEEDS TO 
20:00:08 HAVE A THOROUGH LOOK.
WHEN PEOPLE HAVE HAD THE CHANCE TO 
20:00:09 LOOK AT IT, THEY'VE NOT NOTICED OUR STACKS.

20:00:14 SO THERE'S FIVE OF THEM THERE.
I'D JUST ASK THAT WHATEVER IS DECIDED, 
20:00:18 WHOEVER GETS IT NEEDS TO UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S A SINGLE STORY AND MY HOPE 
20:00:25 IS THE COUNCIL WILL -- AND THE PLANNING COMMISSION WILL UNDERSTAND SOMEBODY 
20:00:28 HAS BEEN THERE FOREVER.
WE WERE THERE BEFORE THERE WERE ANY 
20:00:30 HOUSES.
THERE WAS THE GRIFFIN HOUSE, THE 
20:00:33 BRYANT HOUSE AND THE HIRSCH HOUSE.
THAT'S ALL THAT WAS AROUND US.

20:00:39 WE'VE BEEN BUILDING ALL AROUND, PEOPLE ARE COMING IN, THERE'S OTHER USES THAT 
20:00:45 CAN BE USED ON THAT FACILITY AND THAT SITE THAT'S A LOW DENSITY TO MAKE A 
20:00:48 DIFFERENCE FOR THE COMMUNITY AND ALLOW US TO DO WHAT WE DO.

20:00:53 I THINK THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO  SAY.
>> Chair Yee: ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU.

20:00:57 >> OKAY.
I DID SOMETHING TO MY  MICROPHONE.

20:01:02 CAN YOU GUYS HEAR ME BETTER, MARIA?
>> YOU'RE STILL A LITTLE  MUFFLED, 
20:01:07 TRISH.
I'LL GO AHEAD AND ANNOUNCE IT.

20:01:14 MR. MIR, YOU'VE BEEN UNMUTED, YOU CAN SPEAK NOW.

20:01:18 >> HI THERE.
I HOPE YOU ALL CAN HEAR ME.

20:01:26 MY NAME IS MIR AMANATH.
I'M A MEMBER OF THE SABA COMMUNITY.

20:01:29 I JUST WANT TO SUPPORT THIS PURCHASE FOR SABA.

20:01:35 THEY'VE BEEN INSTRUMENTAL IN ESTABLISHING SOME OF THE SERVICES FOR 
20:01:39 OUR COMMUNITY WHICH WERE NEVER THERE FOR THE PAST 25 YEARS.

20:01:47 THEY'VE BUILT A SCHOOL, QUALITY SCHOOL WITH KIDS GOING TO BEST OF THE 
20:01:55 UNIVERSITIES.
THEY'VE SHOWN THAT THE COMMUNITY NEEDS 
20:01:58 -- ALL THE NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITIES WERE MET.

20:02:02 THEY HAVE SERVICES, THEY PROVIDE FOOD ON A DAILY BASIS.

20:02:08 THE ENTIRE VOLUNTEER ABODE AND THE COMMUNITY OVER AT SABA HAS DONE A 
20:02:14 FABULOUS JOB IN GETTING THE COMMUNITY TOGETHER AND PROVIDING THEM WITH CIVIL 
20:02:18 SERVICES AS WELL AS ALL OF THE SERVICES THAT WE NEED AS A COMMUNITY TO CALL IT 
20:02:23 HOME.
SO WE LOOK -- WE HIGHLY RESPECT 
20:02:29 EVERYTHING THAT SABA DOES FOR OUR COMMUNITY, AND WE WOULD LOVE TO SEE 
20:02:37 THEM GET THIS PROPERTY AND BUILD A SCHOOL THAT WILL SERVE OUR COMMUNITY 
20:02:42 IN THE EAST BAY, BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE A FACILITY ON THE EAST BAY HERE IN 
20:02:48 FREMONT, AND WE SEVERELY LACK THAT OPPORTUNITY FOR THE RESIDENTS IN 
20:02:54 FREMONT AND THE NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE WE CAN SEND OUR KIDS THERE.

20:02:57 SO FROM A LOCATION STANDPOINT AND FROM A MEMBER DISTRIBUTION STANDPOINT IN 
20:03:04 THE BAY AREA, IT'S A STRATEGIC LOCATION FOR ALL OUR KIDS TO GO TO, SO I WOULD 
20:03:10 REALLY APPRECIATE THE SUPPORT FROM THE NEIGHBORS, MEMBERS, COMMUNITY AND ALL 
20:03:12 OF YOU COMMISSIONERS, AS WELL AS THE CITY PERSONNEL.

20:03:13 THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SAY.
THANK YOU.

20:03:20 >> Chair Yee: THANK YOU.
MARIA, DO WE HAVE ANY MORE SPEAKERS?

20:03:27 >> YES, WE DO.
THE NEXT SPEAKER IS MR. HAMZA.

20:03:32 YOU CAN SPEAK NOW.
>> HI.

20:03:35 GOOD EVENING, EVERYONE.
PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF YOU CAN HEAR 
20:03:36 ME.
>> WE CAN HEAR YOU.

20:03:39 >> Chair Yee: WE CAN HEAR YOU.
>> ALL RIGHT.

20:03:46 I WANT TO PRESENT MY POINT OF VIEWS AS A DIRECT BENEFICIARY AS A MEMBER WHO 
20:03:50 UTILIZES SABA'S FACILITY AT VARIOUS LOCATIONS.

20:03:54 SO I WANTED TO PRESENT MY INPUT IN FRONT OF THE CITY PERSONNEL.

20:03:57 THANK YOU FOR PUTTING THIS MEETING TOGETHER.

20:04:05 I MOVED HERE FROM HOUSTON, TEXAS A LITTLE OVER TWO YEARS AGO, AS PART OF 
20:04:07 A JOB WHICH IS AN ESSENTIAL BUSINESS AS IT CAN BE.

20:04:18 AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT SABA AS AN ORGANIZATION HAS A VERY POSITIVE 
20:04:22 PRESENCE IN THE COMMUNITY.
NOT JUST WITHIN THE MUSLIM COMMUNITY, 
20:04:26 BUT OUTSIDE AS WELL.
THE FOOTPRINT THEY HAVE IN SAN JOSÉ 
20:04:33 AND THE SURROUNDING AREAS WITHIN THE BAY AREA IS BASICALLY KNOWN TO 
20:04:38 MAJORITIES.
THEIR COMMUNITY OUTREACH WITHIN THE 
20:04:42 MUSLIM COMMUNITY AND INTERFAITH SESSIONS THAT THEY CARRY AT THEIR 
20:04:46 VARIOUS FACILITIES, THE SCHOOLING SYSTEM THAT THEY HAVE CURRENTLY FOR 
20:04:54 THE KIDS, THE COMMUNITY OUTREACH AND VARIOUS SERVICES THAT THEY  OFFER, 
20:05:01 THEY HAVE BASICALLY PRESENTED SUCH A POSITIVE PICTURE OF THE COMMUNITY IN 
20:05:03 THE BAY AREA THAT IT IS SECOND TO NONE.

20:05:12 AND THAT BEING SAID, I TRULY HOPE THAT CITY OFFICIALS DO VOTE IN THE FAVOR OF 
20:05:23 THIS PURCHASE, AND BASICALLY PROVIDE US AN OPPORTUNITY TO COME ON AND GAIN 
20:05:26 APPROVAL OURSELVES THAT WHAT WE'VE DONE OVER AND OVER AGAIN, WE CAN DO IT AT 
20:05:28 THIS FACILITY AS WELL.
BECAUSE THE FOOTPRINT IS ALREADY 
20:05:30 THERE.
THE COMMUNITY IS ESTABLISHED.

20:05:39 WE HAVE GREAT EXAMPLES IN THE PAST THAT WE HAVE BASICALLY EXECUTED THE PLANS 
20:05:44 -- SO --
>> MR. HAMZA, YOUR TIME IS UP.

20:05:53 >> THANK YOU.
>> Ms. Cordova: MARIA, CAN YOU HEAR ME 
20:05:55 NOW?
>> YES, I CAN HEAR YOU NOW, TRISH.

20:05:57 >> Ms. Cordova: OKAY, GOOD.
I JUST WANTED TO TEST IT.

20:06:03 I'M TRYING DIFFERENT THINGS.
WE HAVE TWO MORE SPEAKERS, CHAIR YEE, 
20:06:08 AND THE NEXT ONE IS MARCIE.
GO AHEAD AND SPEAK.

20:06:12 >> GOOD EVENING.
MY NAME IS MARCIE.

20:06:19 I AM A 47-YEAR-OLD RESIDENT OF CALIFORNIA, THIS AREA.

20:06:26 SO I ACTUALLY GREW UP HERE.
I AM A WORKING MEMBER FOR 25 YEARS AS 
20:06:30 A PHARMACIST.
SO TONIGHT I'M HERE TO TALK ABOUT -- 
20:06:37 I'M ALSO A MEMBER OF THE SABA, AND ALSO I'M HERE TO SPEAK AS A PARENT MOSTLY.

20:06:43 I HAVE TWO KIDS THAT ATTEND WRIGHT ACADEMY.

20:06:50 MY HOUSE IS LOCATED IN CALIFORNIA AND FOR THE LAST 11 YEARS, I'VE BEEN 
20:06:56 DRIVING MY KIDS TO RISE ACADEMY, WHICH IS LOCATED IN SAN JOSÉ AREA.

20:07:02 , EVERY DAY.
I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY 
20:07:06 TO HAVE THEM GO TO A SCHOOL WHICH IS CLOSER TO MY HOUSE IN FREMONT.

20:07:13 SO THIS IS A HUGE OPPORTUNITY FOR ME TO ATTEND -- FOR MY KIDS TO ATTEND THEIR 
20:07:18 SCHOOL AND ALSO TO BE A MEMBER OF THE SABA IN FREMONT.

20:07:27 THE OPPORTUNITIES THEY HAVE AT RISE ACADEMY IS THEY'RE ALWAYS GIVING A 
20:07:35 HELPING HAND TO THE POPULATION OF THE COMMUNITY, AND THEY GO AS FAR AS CITY 
20:07:40 OF -- I MEAN, VERY FAR, AS FAR AS FREMONT, OR PLEASANTON.

20:07:46 WE HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO COMMUTE FROM THE PLEASANTON  AREA, LIVERMORE 
20:07:51 AREA, WALNUT CREEK AREA, PLEASANT HILL AREA TO RISE ACADEMY.

20:07:58 SO THERE'S JUST A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT WANT THEIR KIDS TO GET A GOOD 
20:08:04 EDUCATION WITH GOOD -- IN A GOOD ENVIRONMENT SO THAT THEY CAN HAVE GOOD 
20:08:09 MANNERS AND BECOME A VERY HELPFUL MEMBER OF THE SOCIETY.

20:08:10 THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SAY.
THANK YOU.

20:08:17 SO I HOPE THIS GOES THROUGH, AND I HOPE THAT THIS REALLY GOES THROUGH.

20:08:20 I APPRECIATE YOUR LISTENING TO MY WORDS.

20:08:23 THANK YOU.
>> Chair Yee: ALL RIGHT.

20:08:26 THANK YOU, MARCIE.
TRISH?

20:08:29 >> Ms. Cordova: CHAIR YEE, WE HAVE TWO MORE SPEAKERS.

20:08:33 I WILL GO AHEAD AND ANNOUNCE THE NEXT SPEAKER.

20:08:44 ZEHRA AHSAN.
PLEASE GO AHEAD AND SPEAK.

20:08:45 >> HI THERE.
HOPE YOU CAN HEAR ME.

20:08:48 I'VE LIVED IN THE BAY AREA FOR ABOUT 20 YEARS.

20:08:52 I'M A CURRENT RESIDENT OF FREMONT, KIMBER GOMES AREA.

20:08:56 MY SON ATTENDS HOPKINS JUNIOR HIGH.
WHEN I FIRST MOVED HERE, I STARTED 
20:09:01 WORKING FOR THE CITY OF FREMONT AS A YOUTH SERVICES COORDINATOR, SO I HAVE 
20:09:05 A LOT OF CONNECTIONS TO FREMONT FOR A VERY LONG TIME.

20:09:11 IN GENERAL, I FEEL LIKE THIS IS A REALLY GOOD VENTURE FOR THE CITY OF 
20:09:21 FREMONT TO SPEARHEAD.
THIS SCHOOL AND RESIDENTIAL SERVICES, 
20:09:27 HOMELESS SERVICES, THEY PROVIDE A VARIOUS NUMBER OF SERVICES THAT I 
20:09:29 THINK WOULD BE VERY BENEFICIAL TO FREMONT IN GENERAL.

20:09:36 NOT JUST THE SABA COMMUNITY BUT THE WHOLE OF FREMONT AND THE EAST BAY.

20:09:41 THE SCHOOL IS DESIGNED TO SUPPLEMENT THE ALREADY STELLAR SCHOOL SYSTEM OF 
20:09:49 FREMONT UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT.
AND THE SHELTER AND THE RESIDENTIAL 
20:09:52 SERVICES I THINK ARE REALLY WONDERFUL ADDS TO THE PROPOSAL.

20:10:01 THE SABA COMMUNITY PURCHASE IS DESIGNED TO, I GUESS, YOU KNOW, STEP IN THE 
20:10:10 SAME -- IN THE SAME WAY AS THE OSHER FAMILY COMMUNITY CENTER, JCC IN PALO 
20:10:15 ALTO, PROVIDING SENIOR HOUSING, ADULT HOUSING, SCHOOLS, EDUCATION, HOMELESS 
20:10:21 PROGRAMS, ET CETERA.
SO THIS VENTURE IS NOT EXACTLY 
20:10:23 DIFFERENT THAN OTHER VENTURES IN THE BAY AREA.

20:10:33 I WILL ALSO ADD THAT THE BAY AREA IN GENERAL HAS AN EXTREMELY HIGH 
20:10:39 SINGLE-FAMILY HOUSING RATE.
THERE IS VERY LITTLE HIGH-DENSITY 
20:10:45 HOUSING IN THE BAY AREA.
AND AS WE KNOW, THERE IS VERY LITTLE 
20:10:50 HIGH-DENSITY HOUSING IN GENERAL AND VERY LITTLE LOW INCOME HOUSING.

20:10:54 THIS IS A PROBLEM THAT WE ARE EXACERBATING BY OUR ZONING PLANS 
20:10:56 CURRENTLY, AND IT'S GOING TO BE A PROBLEM FOR OUR FUTURE YEN RANGE OF 
20:10:59 MOTIONS.
IT'S GOING TO BE A PROBLEM FOR MY 12, 
20:11:03 13-YEAR-OLD SON. WHEN HE GETS TO BE 34 YEARS OLD.

20:11:06 SO THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT WE WANT TO EXACERBATE NOW.

20:11:13 WE WANT TO NIP THIS PROBLEM IN THE BUD NOW, 20, 30 YEARS BEFORE OUR NEXT 
20:11:19 GENERATION HAS TO DEAL WITH IT.
SO I WHOLEHEARTEDLY SUPPORT THIS 
20:11:24 VENTURE, AND I HOPE ALSO THAT THE FREMONT PLANNING COMMISSION WILL 
20:11:29 SUPPORT THIS VENTURE AS WELL.
>> Chair Yee: ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU.

20:11:32 TRISH?
>> Ms. Cordova: YES.

20:11:37 WE HAVE FOUR SPEAKERS.
>> Chair Yee: WE HAVE FOUR MORE?

20:11:40 >> Ms. Cordova: I HAVE FOUR  MORE.
>> Chair Yee: LET'S MAKE SURE THAT THE 
20:11:42 TIMER IS ON.
>> Ms. Cordova: OKAY.

20:11:45 MARIA, DO YOU WANT TO SET THE TIMEER?
>> IT'S ON.

20:11:48 I'M MONITORING IT.
THAT NOISE YOU HERE, THAT MEANS IT'S 
20:11:53 THE END OF THEIR TIME.
>> Ms. Cordova: OKAY.

20:12:02 I'LL ANNOUNCE THE NEXT SPEAKER.
ZOHAAD MERCHANT, GO AHEAD AND SPEAK.

20:12:03 >> THANK YOU SO MUCH.
APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY.

20:12:05 MY WIFE AND I ARE RESIDENTS IN IRVINGTON.

20:12:09 WE ACTUALLY LIVE ABOUT TWO MINUTES WALKING DISTANCE AWAY FROM THE 
20:12:14 PROPERTY THAT'S BEING DISCUSSED.
AND WE WOULD GLADLY WELCOME THE SABA 
20:12:16 COMMUNITY TO OUR BACKYARD.
WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THE CHALLENGES 
20:12:21 WE'VE HAD NOW THAT WE'VE BEEN IN THE BAY AREA FOR THE LAST SIX YEARS OR SO, 
20:12:26 THE THREE THINGS THAT STAND OUT, ONE ARE THE OPTIONS ON HOUSING, NUMBER TWO 
20:12:31 WOULD BE THE RESOURCES FOR THE HOMELESS POPULATION, AND NUMBER THREE WOULD BE 
20:12:34 THE SCHOOL OPTIONS FOR OUR STUDENTS, FOR OUR CHILDREN.

20:12:40 AND SO THE FACT THAT THIS PROJECT ADDRESSES ALL THREE OF THOSE AND IS IN 
20:12:44 AN AREA THAT I THINK BADLY NEEDS IT, WE WOULD GLADLY SUPPORT THE EFFORTS HERE 
20:12:50 TO PURCHASE THE PROPERTY AND SUPPORT THE PLAN THAT'S BEEN  OUTLAID BY THE 
20:12:51 APPLICANT.
THANK YOU.

20:12:58 >> Chair Yee: ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU.
>> Ms. Cordova: CHAIR YEE, I HAVE 
20:13:00 THREE MORE SPEAKERS.
I'LL GO AHEAD AND ANNOUNCE THE NEXT 
20:13:16 ONE.
THE NEXT SPEAKER IS ZAHED -- I DON'T 
20:13:22 SEE THE NAME.
LET ME SEE.

20:13:28 OKAY.
I'LL GO AHEAD AND -- MARIA, DID YOU 
20:13:30 PROMOTE THEM?
I DON'T SEE THEM.

20:13:37 >> I DON'T SEE A ZAHED.
I SEE -- HOW ABOUT AKBER?

20:13:41 >> Ms. Cordova: OKAY, AKBER KAZMI, GO AHEAD AND SPEAK.

20:13:57 >> CAN YOU HEAR ME?
>> Ms. Cordova: YES, WE CAN HEAR YOU.

20:14:03 GO AHEAD.
>> SORRY, I WAS HAVING PROBLEMS WITH 
20:14:06 MY AUDIO.
SABA RUNS THREE COMMUNITY  CENTERS OF 
20:14:13 SUNDAY SCHOOL, FULL TIME SCHOOL AS RISE ACADEMY, AND WE PUBLISHED A BOOK, WE 
20:14:18 HAVE PUBLISHING OPERATIONS, AND WE DO ADULT EDUCATION.

20:14:26 SO IN THIS PARTICULAR LOCATION, WE ARE PLANNING TO DO SIX  THINGS:  STARTING 
20:14:30 A SCHOOL IN FREMONT THAT CATERS TO THE COMMUNITY THAT YOU JUST HEARD FROM.

20:14:36 A SENIOR CENTER AND A COMMUNITY CENTER TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO COME IN, 
20:14:41 CONGREGATE, ESPECIALLY SENIORS, AND ALSO THE PROGRAMS THAT SABA OFFERS IN 
20:14:44 OTHER LOCATIONS, WE'D DUPLICATE THOSE HERE.

20:14:50 WE WILL CREATE ADULT EDUCATION, WE WILL CREATE SYSTEMS WHERE THE LOCAL YOUTH 
20:14:57 ARE COMING IN TO OUR FACILITY IN NON-SCHOOL HOURS AND DOING SPORTS, 
20:15:01 DOING SOCIALIZING, LEARNING THINGS THAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO LEARN TO BECOME 
20:15:09 PRODUCTIVE CITIZEN OF FREMONT.
WE WILL ALSO, AS DISCUSSED EARLIER, 
20:15:19 CREATE HOUSING FOR OUR SENIORS, FOR OUR TEACHERS, FOR OUR LOW INCOME MEMBERS 
20:15:22 OF THE COMMUNITY, AS YOU'VE HEARD FROM MULTIPLE PEOPLE THAT AFFORDING HOUSING 
20:15:27 IS VERY DIFFICULT.
ATTRACTING TEACHERS, EDUCATORS IS VERY 
20:15:31 DIFFICULT IN FREMONT BECAUSE THEY CAN'T LIVE CLOSE BY AND THEY HAVE TO DRIVE 
20:15:35 TWO HOURS TO COME HERE.
SO WE WILL DO ALL THESE THINGS, 
20:15:41 WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH OUR NEIGHBORS, WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH 
20:15:46 CITY, WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH THE COUNTY TO MAKE SURE THAT THE COUNTY 
20:15:53 AND CITY PLANS GET IMPLEMENTED AND OUR LOCAL COMMUNITY GETS BENEFIT OUT OF  
20:15:55 IT.
AND ALL THIS ACTIVITY WILL CREATE 
20:15:57 JOBS.
WE WILL HAVE TEACHERS, WE WILL HAVE 
20:16:01 KITCHEN WORKERS AS BROTHER SALIM MENTIONED, WE'LL BE COOKING FOODS FOR 
20:16:07 HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE, WE WILL CREATE JOBS AS WELL AND BRING A LOT OF EDUCATION 
20:16:09 AND COMMUNITY SERVICES TO CENTRAL FREMONT.

20:16:12 FOR THIS PROJECT.
THANK YOU.

20:16:14 >> Chair Yee: ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU.
YOUR TIME IS UP.

20:16:18 ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU.
>> Ms. Cordova: OKAY,  CHAIRPERSON 
20:16:22 YEE, I HAVE TWO MORE SPEAKERS.
I'LL GO AHEAD AND ANNOUNCE THE NEXT 
20:16:27 ONE.
THE NEXT SPEAKER IS ZAHED  KHURASANI.

20:16:33 GO AHEAD AND SPEAK.
>> HELLO, GOOD EVENING,  EVERYONE.

20:16:36 MY NAME IS ZAHED.
CAN YOU HEAR ME?

20:16:39 >> Ms. Cordova: YES, WE CAN HEAR YOU.
>> OKAY, THANK YOU, TRISH.

20:16:44 SO WE MOVED TO THE BAY AREA THREE YEARS BACK, AND I HAVE A 3 1/2-YEAR-OLD 
20:16:46 DAUGHTER, AND SHE GOES TO RISE ACADEMY.

20:16:54 AND THE AMOUNT OF POSITIVE IMPACT THAT SHE HAS HAD ONCE SHE STARTED GOING TO 
20:17:00 SCHOOL HAS BEEN TREMENDOUS, AND I ATTRIBUTE THIS SUCCESS TO THE SABA 
20:17:05 LEADERSHIP, SO THAT'S THE MOST CORE ELEMENT FOR ME WHENEVER I LOOK AT AN 
20:17:11 ORGANIZATION, AND THEY HAVE BEEN DOING A TREMENDOUS JOB NOT ONLY IN TERMS OF 
20:17:15 HAVING THE SCHOOLS BUT ALSO ON A COMMUNITY LEVEL AS WELL, GETTING THE 
20:17:22 WHOLE COMMUNITY TOGETHER, DOING COMMUNITY OUTREACH PROGRAMS, AND ALSO 
20:17:26 HELPING THE COMMUNITY IN ANY WAY POSSIBLE THEY CAN.

20:17:30 SO I WANT TO THANK THE SABA LEADERSHIP FOR ALWAYS STEPPING UP, AND I ALSO 
20:17:35 WANT TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO THE CITY PLANNING COMMISSION COMMITTEE FOR 
20:17:41 HAVING THIS ZOOM CALL AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO SEE A SABA SCHOOL IN 
20:17:41 FREMONT.
THANK YOU.

20:17:46 >> Chair Yee: THANK YOU.
>> Ms. Cordova: OKAY, CHAIR YEE, I 
20:17:49 HAVE ONE MORE SPEAKER, I'LL GO AHEAD AND ANNOUNCE THAT PERSON.

20:17:58 MARYAM ADLPARVAR.
PLEASE GO AHEAD AND SPEAK.

20:18:12 MARYAM ADLPARVAR.
>> CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW?

20:18:15 >> Ms. Cordova: YES.
>> HELLO, EVERYONE.

20:18:18 THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR GIVING THIS OPPORTUNITY FOR ME TO  SPEAK.

20:18:21 THANK YOU FOR PUTTING THIS ALL TOGETHER.

20:18:24 IT'S REALLY APPRECIATING TO SEE THAT WE CAN MAKE CHANGES.

20:18:33 SO I JOINED SABA IN 2002, AND IT WAS ONLY A SMALL MOSQUE.

20:18:40 THE ONLY REASON I JOINED, IT WAS BECAUSE WHEN I SMOKE TO THE LEADERSHIP 
20:18:44 AND THEY TOLD ME THAT THEY WERE GOING TO HAVE A SCHOOL, WE EXPECT TO HAVE A 
20:18:51 SCHOOL SOON, AND THEY STOOD ON THEIR WORDS AND THEY REALLY  WORKED HARD AND 
20:18:59 BY 2000 THE SCHOOL STARTED.
IT WAS VERY HARD TO START THE SCHOOL, 
20:19:03 BUT WITH THE PURE INTENTION OF THE LEADERSHIP AND THE BOARD MEMBERS, 
20:19:09 PEOPLE WHO ARE ACTUALLY INVOLVED, THE SCHOOL REALLY FLOURISHED, AND THANK 
20:19:13 GOD WE HAVE SO MANY KIDS FROM ALL DIFFERENT CITIES COMING AROUND.

20:19:20 AND THAT'S A VERY BLESSING.
SO I REALLY BELIEVE IN SABA, I RESPECT 
20:19:24 THEIR VALUES.
THEIR VALUES FOR ALL DIFFERENT RACES, 
20:19:27 ALL DIFFERENT KINDS OF PEOPLE WHO WANT TO JOIN.

20:19:35 AND I'M SURE BECAUSE OF WHAT I HAVE SEEN, WE CAN SEE GREAT ALSO 
20:19:38 OPPORTUNITIES IN FREMONT, BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE COMING FROM 
20:19:45 HAYWARD, ALL AROUND, THAT THAT CAN MAKE -- THAT HELP WITH THE TRAFFIC, COMING 
20:19:51 ALL THE WAY TO SABA ACADEMY, AND ALSO WITH THE COMMUNITY, FOR THE COMMUNITY 
20:19:56 AROUND THAT AREA, SO I'M REALLY FOR IT BECAUSE THEY ARE VERY CARING 
20:20:03 LEADERSHIP AND THE BOARD MEMBERS AND THE WHOLE COMMUNITY UNDER THEIR 
20:20:06 LEADERSHIP.
I REALLY APPRECIATE IT, AND I 
20:20:10 APPRECIATE IF YOU ALSO GET INTO ACCOUNT IN YOUR DECISIONS.

20:20:17 THANK YOU SO MUCH.
>> Ms. Cordova: CHAIR YEE, WE DO NOT 
20:20:20 HAVE ANY MORE SPEAKERS.
>> Chair Yee: OKAY.

20:20:26 SO THIS IS THE PART OF THE CLOSING OF THE PUBLIC HEARING, BUT THEN WOULD THE 
20:20:27 APPLICANT LIKE TO SAY ANYTHING IN CLOSING?

20:20:31 I THINK IN THE NOTES HERE, YOU'VE GOT UP TO 3 MINUTES.

20:20:41 >> CHAIRMAN YEE, WE DO HAVE A PANELIST, MR. MASTAN, WHO HAS HIS HAND RAISED.

20:20:46 >> Chair Yee: OKAY.
I GUESS UNMUTE HIM.

20:21:01 >> CHAIRMAN YEE, I WOULD LIKE TO ASK OUR ARCHITECT TO TAKE THIS TIME TO 
20:21:05 GIVE THE CLOSING STATEMENT.
>> THANK YOU, SALIM.

20:21:08 SO I WANTED TO --
>> Planner Pullen: EXCUSE ME, CHAIR?

20:21:16 I JUST WANT TO -- POINT OF  ORDER.
THERE ARE A COUPLE PANELISTS WITH THE 
20:21:19 NAME SALIM.
IT APPEARS THAT A PANELIST LINK WAS 
20:21:23 FORWARDED, AND SO THE GENTLEMAN WHO ACTUALLY HAD HIS NAME UP TO SPEAK WAS 
20:21:26 NOT THE ACTUAL SALIM BUT THE GENTLEMAN WITH THE PAPER UP.

20:21:30 SO I THINK HE WOULD SPEAK AND THEN WE'D GO BACK TO THE APPLICANT REBUTTAL.

20:21:40 >> THANK YOU, EVERYBODY.
CAN YOU ALL HEAR ME?

20:21:41 OKAY.
GREAT.

20:21:46 I'M SORRY, I WAS USING ANOTHER NUMBER I THOUGHT IT WAS THE PUBLIC'S NUMBER, 
20:21:49 THIS SEEMS TO BE SALIM'S NAME POPPED UP ON MY SCREEN.

20:21:53 I'M A RESIDENT OF FREMONT FOR THE LAST 25 YEARS AND I'M A REAL ESTATE 
20:21:54 BROKER.
I'VE BEEN DOING A LOT OF TRANSACTIONS 
20:21:59 IN FREMONT FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS NOW.
I HAVE BEEN HELPING SABA WITH THIS 
20:22:04 TRANSACTION SO THAT'S A DISCLAIMER, I AM A BUYER ON BEHALF OF SABA.

20:22:08 I WANT PO SPEAK ABOUT A COUPLE OF THINGS, NUMBER ONE ABOUT THE HOMELESS 
20:22:10 IN FREMONT.
I'VE LIVED IN FREMONT FOR OVER 25 
20:22:17 YEARS, I'VE SERVED IN THE MOBILITY AND TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE IN THE CITY 
20:22:21 OF  FREMONT.
THERE IS A BIG PROBLEM IN FREMONT WITH 
20:22:26 HOMELESS PEOPLE.
THE FACT THAT THERE IS NOT ENOUGH DONE 
20:22:31 FOR THEM, SO SABA OUT OF THE BLUE, TO MY SURPRISE FRANKLY SPEAKING, HAS 
20:22:33 OFFERED TO DO A SERVICE FOR THE COMMUNITY IN FREMONT.

20:22:38 SO FOR ME AS AN INDIVIDUAL, I'M NOT TALKING AS A REAL ESTATE BROKER BUT AS 
20:22:42 AN INDIVIDUAL, IT'S A BIG PLUS.
I'VE GONE AROUND TO ALL THESE AREAS 
20:22:48 THAT SALIM HAS TALKED ABOUT, WHERE THERE'S SO MANY PEOPLE THAT ARE 
20:22:53 HOMELESS, YOU GO RIGHT NOW TO LAKE ELIZABETH AND YOU SEE PEOPLE IN 
20:22:55 TENTS.
I FEEL VERY EMBARRASSED WHEN I SEE 
20:22:59 THAT.
I FEEL LIKE BECOMING A CITY COUNCILER 
20:23:01 AND CHANGING THE WHOLE FACE OF THIS NEIGHBORHOOD.

20:23:05 HOUSING IN FREMONT ARE $1.2 MILLION YET PEOPLE ARE SLEEPING IN TENTS.

20:23:08 AND I FEEL SHAMED THAT WHEN I SEE SUCH THINGS IN OUR NEIGHBORHOODS.

20:23:13 SO WHAT SABA IS DOING IS ADDRESSING ONE AREA OF THIS HOMELESSNESS, IS 
20:23:18 PROVIDING FOOD.
HAVING A KITCHEN IS A BIG PLUS FOR 
20:23:24 SABA, HAVING A FACILITY FOR THEM TO CATER FOR THAT NEEDY COMMUNITY IS AN 
20:23:30 EXCELLENT PLUS FOR OUR SOCIETY.
I UNDERSTAND THE NEIGHBOR WHO SPOKE 
20:23:33 REGARDING THE MORTUARY, OF COURSE SABA, WHAT I SEE FROM THE MANAGEMENT 
20:23:37 PERSPECTIVE AND THE WAIT THEY MANAGE THE ORGANIZATION AND THE SCHOOLS AND 
20:23:41 THE TEACHERS AND THE BOARD, FANTASTIC, ONE OF THE BEST PEOPLE I'VE DEALT WITH 
20:23:47 IN THE PAST.
OF COURSE AS A FINANCIAL TRANSACTION 
20:23:50 BUT AS MANAGEMENT STRUCTURE, VERY, VERY WELL ORGANIZED.

20:23:53 I'VE BEEN DEALING WITH THEM FOR ALMOST TWO, THREE MONTHS NOW, THEY ARE THE 
20:23:57 RIGHT PEOPLE TO MANAGE THIS LOT THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT, THE TWO-ACRE LOT 
20:24:01 TO BUILD IT AS A SCHOOL, AS WELL AS DOING COMMUNITY SERVICE.

20:24:06 I MYSELF AS A COMMUNITY MEMBER, NOT AS A REAL ESTATE BROKER, WHOLEHEARTEDLY 
20:24:10 SUPPORT THE ORGANIZATION, AND I THINK IT'S A FANTASTIC PROPOSAL TO HAVE IT 
20:24:14 AS A SCHOOL -- AS A -- SCHOOL.
>> Chair Yee: THANK YOU, YOUR TIME IS 
20:24:15 UP.
THANK YOU FOR SHARING.

20:24:23 OKAY.
SO I GUESS NOW WE GO BACK TO THE 
20:24:28 APPLICANT, WHO HAS THREE MINUTES TO SAY ANYTHING FOR THEIR CLOSE.

20:24:32 YES?
>> THANK YOU, COMMISSIONER YEE.

20:24:40 MY NAME IS AMIN ADIL QAZI, I'M AN ARCHITECT CONSULTANT FOR  SABA.

20:24:49 TRISH, IS IT POSSIBLE TO PULL  UP -- I HAVE A PDF, I THINK THAT WILL HELP 
20:24:56 ANSWER SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED FOR WHY WE ARE CHOOSING 
20:25:01 THE URBAN RESIDENTIAL FOR THIS AMENDMENT.

20:25:07 >> Ms. Cordova: OKAY, IS THIS THE ONE THAT HANG SENT TO ME EARLIER?

20:25:09 >> YES.
>> Ms. Cordova: I THINK I HAVE THAT.

20:25:11 LET ME GO AHEAD AND TRY.
JUST GIVE ME A MOMENT.

20:25:13 THANK YOU.
>> OKAY.

20:25:17 ALL RIGHT.
SO WHILE TRISH IS PULLING IT UP, I 
20:25:29 JUST WANTED TO POINT OUT  THAT -- JUST GOING BY, BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THE 
20:25:36 CHANGE HAS TO HAPPEN, THE EXISTING AMENDMENT, THE EXISTING CANNOT STAY 
20:25:42 THE WAY IT IS, SO WHAT WE ARE LOOKING TO DO IS WE LOOKED AT THE VISION PLAN 
20:25:47 FOR THE CITY OF FREMONT, WE ALSO LOOKED AT THE GENERAL PLAN FOR THE CITY OF 
20:25:53 FREMONT, AND ALL OF THOSE INDICATIONS ARE THAT THERE ARE PRIORITY AREAS FOR 
20:25:56 THE CITY DEVELOPMENT.
TRISH ACTUALLY I CAN SHARE MY SCREEN 
20:25:57 IF YOU ALLOW ME TO.
IS THAT POSSIBLE?

20:25:59 >> Ms. Cordova: YES, THAT WOULD BE BETTER.

20:26:01 GO AHEAD.
>> OKAY, GREAT.

20:26:05 I'LL DO THAT.
OKAY.

20:26:11 CAN YOU ALL SEE MY SCREEN?
>> Ms. Cordova: OKAY, YES, I CAN SEE 
20:26:13 IT.
>> OKAY, GREAT, GREAT.

20:26:21 SO I'LL JUST PULL OUT A FEW REASONS FOR WHY WE SELECTED WHAT WE SELECTED.

20:26:28 FIRST OF ALL, IN GENERAL, SINCE THE COUNTY IS SELLING, THERE WAS AN 
20:26:32 EXISTING SCHOOL THAT ACTUALLY HAS -- THERE WAS A QUESTION EARLIER, THE 
20:26:45 SCHOOL IS ACTUALLY NOT THERE ANYMORE, BUT CHANGING HANDS TO SABA FOR THIS 
20:26:51 PROPERTY WILL CONTINUE THE ORIGINAL INTENTION OF THIS AREA, OF THIS 
20:26:55 PROPERTY, WHICH SHOULD BE TO CARRY ON THE EDUCATION FORWARD.

20:27:03 THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING HAS BEEN AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN WHAT SABA HAS BEEN 
20:27:10 LOOKING FOR, AND IF WE GO FOR MEDIUM DENSITY, THERE ARE A FEW THINGS THAT 
20:27:14 IT DOESN'T ALLOW.
WHAT IT DOESN'T ALLOW IS, BECAUSE THE 
20:27:24 MEDIUM DENSITY DEVELOPMENT REGULATIONS REQUIRE THE HOUSING TO BE SPREAD OUT, 
20:27:32 SO THAT IT TAKES MORE SPACE AND LESS HOUSING THAT DIMINISHES THE 
20:27:34 POSSIBILITY OF PROVIDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING.

20:27:40 SO THAT'S ONE.
AND THEN THE OTHER THING I NOTED WAS 
20:27:45 --
>> Chair Yee: SORRY, UNFORTUNATELY 
20:27:47 YOUR TIME IS UP.
>> OKAY.

20:27:54 I THINK SOME OF IT WAS -- IF I COULD LIKE HAVE ONE MINUTE MORE, I COULD 
20:27:57 COMPLETE THIS.
>> Chair Yee: OKAY, MARIA, COULD YOU 
20:28:00 -- OR TRISH, COULD YOU ADD ANOTHER MINUTE FOR HIM TO  FINISH?

20:28:03 >> DONE.
YES.

20:28:07 >> OKAY.
THANK YOU, APPRECIATE IT.

20:28:13 SO JUST WANTED TO POINT OUT THAT THIS DEVELOPMENT IS IN SYNC WITH THE CITY 
20:28:16 OF FREMONT'S GOALS FOR THE GROWTH IN THIS AREA.

20:28:24 JUST WANTED TO GIVE YOU A PICTURE OF WHAT THE GENERAL PLAN SHOWS, THAT THIS 
20:28:31 IS THE AREA, THIS GRAY IS OUR SITE, AND YOU CAN SEE THE FUTURE GROWTH IS THE 
20:28:41 TOWN CENTER AT HIGH-DENSITY IS THE PLAN, BEING THE BART AREA ON THE 
20:28:46 RIGHT-HAND SIDE IS MOSTLY SINGLE-FAMILY, SO THE MORE DENSITY IS 
20:28:53  INTENDED TO BE GOING THIS WAY SO IT SORT OF JIVES WITH THE FUTURE 
20:28:56 INTENTIONS.
AGAIN, I TOOK A PAGE OUT OF THE VISION 
20:29:02 2030.
THERE ARE THESE TRANSIT AREAS, 
20:29:09 TRANSIT-ORIENTED AREAS THAT ARE SLATED TO BE PRIORITY  DEVELOPMENT AREAS, AND 
20:29:14 SO THAT'S WHAT I WANTED TO LEAVE YOU AT, IS THAT THIS HIGH-DENSITY URBAN IS 
20:29:17 IN LINE WITH THE CITY OF FREMONT.
>> Chair Yee: ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU.

20:29:26 NORMALLY WE WOULD HAVE  CLARIFYING QUESTIONS FOR THE APPLICANT RIGHT NOW, 
20:29:30 BUT BECAUSE I'M SEEING THAT WE'RE ALMOST AT 8:30, WE NEED TO GIVE OUR 
20:29:36 STENOCAPTIONER A BREAK.
SO LET'S KEEP OUR QUESTIONS IN OUR 
20:29:42 MIND, LET'S TAKE OUR  10-MINUTE BREAK, SO LET'S GET BACK AT I GUESS IT LOOKS 
20:29:46 LIKE AT 8:39?
>> SOUNDS GOOD.

20:29:49 >> Chair Yee: ALL RIGHT.
SEE YOU ALL IN ABOUT 10 MINUTES.

20:30:03 >> Planner Pullen: DURING THE BREAK, PLEASE TURN OFF YOUR VIDEO AND 
20:30:13 MICROPHONES.
>>

20:39:26 [ RECESS ]
[ RECESS ]

20:39:31 >> CHAIRMAN YEE, THERE'S GOING TO BE A SOMETIME NOW THAT WHEN THEY CAN SPEAK 
20:39:34 OR HOW DOES  THAT -- DO WE PUT A TIMER ON?

20:39:39 >> Commissioner Yee:   NO NO NO.
WE'RE DONE, NOW IT'S GOING TO BE 
20:39:40 CLARIFYING QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMISSIONERS.

20:39:42 >> OKAY.
ALL RIGHT.

20:40:30 >> Commissioner Yee:   YES, UH-HUH.
>> CHAIR YE, JUST A HEADS UP.

20:40:37 MY VIDEO IS GETTING A HEADS UP THAT WE CANNOT START BECAUSE THE CHAIR HAS 
20:40:41 STOPPED IT.
>> Commissioner Yee:    TRADITION.

20:40:55 >> I CAN TAKE CARE OF THAT.
>> Commissioner Yee:   THANKS KHANH.

20:40:59 COMMISSIONER CARDENAS YOU'RE BACK.
>> Commissioner Cardenas:   IT'S 
20:41:13 TOUGH!
>> Commissioner Steckler:   TRISH YOU 
20:41:17 NEED TO START MY VIDEO ALSO PNL THIS IS CRAIG.

20:41:23 >> HI CRAIG I WHAT'S GOING ON?
I DIDN'T HEAR THAT.

20:41:25 >> Commissioner Yee:   KHANH --
>> WE GOT IT.

20:41:53 >> OKLAHOMA.
THIS IS CRAIG.

20:41:55 >> Commissioner Yee:   LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE ALMOST EVERYBODY BACK.

20:42:13 I GUESS I WANT TO MAKE SURE I WAIT FOR THE FLICT SO IF THERE IS ANY 
20:42:26 CLARIFYING QUESTIONS OF THE APPLICANT.
IF THE APPLICANT HERE?

20:42:33 >> AKBER KAZMI IS HERE.
CAN YOU HEAR ME?

20:42:35 >> Commissioner Yee:   YES.
>> THANK GOODNESS.

20:42:38 >> AND THE ARCHITECT IS HERE  TOO.
>> Commissioner Yee:   OKAY GREAT.

20:42:43 I THINK WE CAN RESUME THE MEETING AND JOEL I THINK YOU SAID YOU WANTED TO 
20:42:46 ANNOUNCE SOMETHING.
>> Planner Pullen:   YES, JUST REALLY 
20:42:49 BRIEFLY CHAIR.
I JUST WANTED TO NOTE THAT WE DID HEAR 
20:42:53 THE CONCERNS ABOUT THE LIVE STREAM FROM THE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC AND WE ARE 
20:42:59 HAVING THAT I.T. ISSUE LOOKED INTO.
IN THE MEANTIME WE DO HAVE THE ABILITY 
20:43:03 FOR PEOPLE TO FULLY PARTICIPATE BY VIDEO AND TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE MEETING 
20:43:07 HERE ON ZOOM AND THERE WILL BE A ZOOM RECORDING AVAILABLE AFTER THE 
20:43:10 MEETING.
AS WITH EVERYTHING DURING THE PANDEMIC 
20:43:13 WE LEARN TO DEAL WITH TECHNOLOGY THE AND IT IS ONE LITTLE MORE CHALLENGE 
20:43:18 TONIGHT BUT WE TRY TO GET THROUGH IT AND I THINK EVERYBODY'S -- IMPORTANT 
20:43:21 THING,
EVERYBODY IS ABLE TO PARTICIPATE.

20:43:25 SO WITH APOLOGIES, BACK TO YOU.
>> Commissioner Yee:   OKAY, THANK 
20:43:27 YOU.
SO WITH THAT ARE THERE ANY CLARIFYING 
20:43:38 QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMISSION TO THE APPLICANT?

20:43:43 I DON'T SEE ANY RAISED HANDS.
OKAY.

20:43:47 SO WITH THAT, THEN I'LL GO AHEAD AND CLOSE THE PUBLIC HEARING FOR THIS 
20:43:49 ITEM.
AND THEN GO TO LET'S BRING IT IMPACT 
20:43:53 TO THE COMMISSION TO ASK ANY QUESTIONS OF STAFF.

20:43:57 ANY QUESTIONS YOU WANT TO ASK OF STAFF?

20:44:02 OKAY COMMISSIONER DAULTON, I SEE YOUR HAND RAISED.

20:44:03 >> Commissioner Daulton:   THANK YOU CHAIR.

20:44:08 SO A COUPLE OF ISSUES WITH THIS PROJECT.

20:44:20 I MEAN, MY ORIGINAL THOUGHTS ABOUT THE URBAN DENSITY WAS THAT IT SEEMED LIKE 
20:44:27 A LOT FOR A SITE WHICH -- WELL, AT LEAST IN THE CASE OF LIKE THE FREMONT 
20:44:31 HABITAT PROJECT, WE CONSIDERED THAT THERE SHOULD

20:44:38 BE AN ELEMENT OF WHAT I BELIEVE JOEL CALLED FEATHERING INTO THE LOWER 
20:44:44 COMMUNITY IN THE SURROUNDING AREA. FROM THE HIGH DENSITY.

20:44:54 AND SO WHEN THIS -- THIS APPLICANT ASKED FOR THE MAXIMUM, IT SEEMED LIKE 
20:45:06 I WAS WORRIED BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW EXACTLY WHO I WAS TALKING TO AT THE 
20:45:10 BEGINNING.
I WAS WORRIED THIS WAS A COMPLAIIVE 
20:45:19  SPECK LA TIFF SITUATION, OR INCENTIVIZING THE NEW OWNERS.

20:45:23 NOW I SEE THESE GENTLEMEN WHO I KNOW QUITE WELL THROUGH THE COMMUNITY, I NO 
20:45:28 LONGER HAVE THAT ISSUE.
BUT HEARING THE CONCERNS OF THE 
20:45:32 MORTUARY ACROSS THE STREET, I THINK THAT'S A VERY REAL ISSUE.

20:45:40 I MEAN, I KNOW IF I WAS ON THE FIFTH FLOOR OF AN APARTMENT, SENIOR CENTER 
20:45:45 OR WHATEVER, I WOULDN'T WANT TO LOOK DOWN THE CHIMNEY OF THE MORTUARY 
20:45:48 ACROSS THE STREET DOING SIX CREMATIONS A

20:45:53 DAY.
SO MY QUESTION IS:  IS THERE A WAY WE 
20:46:00 CAN, IN THE FURTHER PROCESS OF THIS, MAKE SURE THAT PERHAPS THE SCHOOL IS 
20:46:06 IN THE FRONT OF THE LOT, AND ANY HIGHER BUILDING IS IN THE BACK?

20:46:09 I REALIZE THAT IS A DESIGN CONSIDERATION THAT MAYBE IS GOING TO 
20:46:17 HAVE TO BE HANDLED BY STAFF.
AND ALSO, GIVEN THAT THIS APPLICATION 
20:46:22 SORT OF HINGES ON THE DESIRE FOR WHAT STAFF CALLS FUTURE HOUSING FOR 
20:46:28 TEACHERS, SENIORS AND OTHER COMMUNITY GROUPS INCLUDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS 
20:46:30 THERE
GOING TO BE A WAY WE CAN RESTRICT THEM 
20:46:41 TO THOSE USES?
SO I GUESS THAT WAS TWO QUESTIONS.

20:46:43 >> Planner Pullen:   SO I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY.

20:46:46 IS THIS A QUESTION OF STAFF OR IS THIS A CLARIFYING QUESTION TO THE 
20:46:51 APPLICANT?
I WASN'T SURE WHAT WAS LED UP TO 
20:46:52 THAT.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   TO STAFF.

20:46:56 >> Commissioner Yee:   WE ARE ASKING QUESTIONS OF STAFF.

20:46:58 P.E. SEEMED LIKE --
>> Commissioner Daulton:   I CAN 
20:47:01 CONDENSE IT.
>> Planner Pullen:   NO, NO, I GOT THE 
20:47:05 POINT AND LEGALITY THE PLANNER TAKE A STAB AT IT TOO BUT LET ME ANSWER THE 
20:47:09 SECOND ONE FIRST.
ONCE YOU -- TONIGHT JUST TO CLARIFY 
20:47:12 AND I KNOW YOU'RE AWARE.
THIS IS JUST AUTHORIZING THE FILING OF 
20:47:17 A GENERAL PLAN NUTRITION.
YOU'D BE MAKING THE RECOMMENDATION AND 
20:47:21 ULTIMATELY THE COUNCIL DECIDING WHETHER TO LET THEM FILE THE GENERAL 
20:47:24 APPLICATION FOR URBAN RESIDENTIAL.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   YES.

20:47:33 >> Planner Pullen:   IN CONJUNCTION WITH THAT FORMAL APPLICATION, THERE 
20:47:37 WOULD BE IMPACTS ON THE ENVIRONMENT AND ALSO TECHNICAL REVIEW OF  COMATIBILTY 
20:47:43  COMPATIBILITY OF A
PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT WITH EXISTING 
20:47:49 GENERATORS AROUND THE PROJECT AND ISSUES, EXISTING TRAFFIC, EXISTING 
20:47:52 HAZARDOUS MATERIALS ALL THAT THING WOULD BE RESERVED FOR THAT POINT AND 
20:47:58 WE CAN'T TONIGHT
SPECULATE ON WHAT THAT MIGHT BE.

20:48:04 IT MIGHT BE THAT SOME ONSITE RELATED ADJUSTMENT COULD  PARTIALLY OR TOTALLY 
20:48:08 MITIGATE SOME SORT OF OFFSITE IMPACTS.
WE DON'T KNOW THAT BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T 
20:48:11 DONE STUDIES AND WE DON'T KNOW THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE GROWTH PLANS OF 
20:48:22 THE CREMATORY OR NOT AND AIM ALL THOSE FACTORS, WHETHER THINGS DONE ON THE

20:48:26 CREMATORY TO REDUCE THOSE ISSUES ISSUES, THERE ARE A LOT OF FACTORS WE 
20:48:29 WOULD HAVE TO LOOK AT.
BUT COMING BACK TO YOUR POINT.

20:48:35 NO, IF THE SITE IS REDESIGNATED ULTIMATE REPLY TO URBAN RESIDENTIAL 
20:48:43  ULTIMATELY TO URBAN RESIDENTIAL THERE WOULDN'T BE A WAY NOR THE CITY TO 
20:48:49 CONTROL WHAT KIND OF PROJECT, AS LONG AS THAT PROJECT

20:48:55 FIT WITHIN THE DESIGNATION  RULES.
THIS APPLICANT GAVE A LIST OF THINGS 
20:49:01 THEY WANTED TO DO WITH THE SITE, BUT IF THE SITE WERE TO BE CONVERTED OVER TO 
20:49:05 -- LET'S SAY THE GENERAL PLAN AMENDED WERE TO BE PROPOSED AND THAT WERE TO 
20:49:07 BE
APPROVED AT SOME LATER DATE THEN 
20:49:12 RESIDENTIAL USES WOULD BE GENERALLY AVAILABLE AT THE FULL RANGE OF WHAT'S 
20:49:15 AVAILABLE IN THE GENERAL PLAN DESIGNATION.

20:49:22 I THINK THAT ANSWERED THE FIRST PART, DID I ANSWER THE SECOND PART TOO?

20:49:24 OR IS THERE --
>> Commissioner Daulton:   I THINK YOU 
20:49:27 DID.
I'M LOOKING FOR A SITUATION WHICH, 
20:49:31 WITHIN A DESIGN REVIEW OF A PROJECT LIKE THIS THE STAFF COULD MAKE SURE 
20:49:40 THAT THERE'S A CERTAIN LOGIC TO THE PLACEMENT OF THE LOWER BUILDINGS IN 
20:49:44 THE FRONT AND HIGHER
BUILDINGS IN THE BACK SO WE DON'T HAVE 
20:49:48 THE ISSUE SO MUCH WITH THE CREMATORIUM BUT I THINK YOU ANSWERED THAT AND WHAT 
20:49:51 YOU'RE TELLING ME IS NO YOU CAN'T REALLY DO THAT BECAUSE ANY RESIDENTIAL 
20:49:54 USE WOULD
THEN BE PERMITTED ON THE SITE, AS LONG 
20:49:57 AS IT CONFORMS TO THE ZONING.
>> Planner Pullen:   YES.

20:50:03 THE SHORT ANSWER IS, WE DON'T KNOW THE EXTENT OWHICH AN EXISTING OFFSITE USE 
20:50:07 WOULD CREATE CONSTRAINTS FOR A  PROJECT.

20:50:10 BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE DID ENVIRONMENTAL FOR THE GENERAL PLAN AMENDMENT DONE 
20:50:14 YET AND WE DON'T HAVE THE PROJECT IN FRONT OF US AND WE DON'T KNOW THE 
20:50:21 TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF THE CREMATORY IT CIVIL SO.

20:50:24 >> Commissioner Daulton:   OKAY, THANK YOU.

20:50:30 >> Commissioner Yee:   COMMISSIONER CARDENAS I SEE YOUR HAND WAS UP NEXT.

20:50:33 >> Commissioner Cardenas:   YOU KNOW WHAT JOEL I THINK I WAS A LITTLE BIT 
20:50:38 HUNG UP ON WHAT COMMISSIONER DAULTON BROUGHT UP AND THAT WS THE CREMATORY 
20:50:41 PIECE FOR ME IT SPARKED A COUPLE OF QUICK CONCERNS,

20:50:42 RIGHT?
I LOVE THE DIRECTION OF THIS PROJECT.

20:50:47 I LOVE ALL THE DOING WELL AND DOING GOOD THAT THIS PROJECT DOES FOR THE 
20:50:54 CITY OF FREMONT.
BUT THE -- I'M NOT AN EXPERT IN THE 
20:50:57 ENVIRONMENTAL SIDE OF  THINGS.
BUT I DO -- YOU KNOW, I KNOW THAT 
20:51:02 THERE'S MAYBE IT'S SPECULATION, THAT, YOU KNOW, IF YOU PUT SOMEONE ON A 
20:51:06 FIFTH FLOOR AND THEY'RE GETTING ANY OF THAT SMOKE COMING FROM THE CREMATORY 
20:51:11 COULD THAT BE AN
ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUE, COULD THAT, YOU 
20:51:15 KNOW, CREATE MAYBE AEVEN SOME TYPE OF HEALTH ISSUES.

20:51:18 SO I MEAN THAT WAS THE PART THAT I WAS A LITTLE BIT CONCERNED ABOUT WHEN I 
20:51:22 WAS HEARING THAT.
AND I STARTED TO DO A LITTLE BIT OF 
20:51:27 RESEARCH JUST A QUICK, YOU KNOW, IS THERE AIR POLLUTANTS OR WHATEVER, THAT 
20:51:30 -- MAYBE I'M  OVERTHINKING THAT PIECE OF IT.

20:51:37 I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WHAT WE'RE APPROVING IS GOING TO BE 
20:51:41 SOMETHING SAFE FOR FUTURE RESIDENTS.
>> Planner Pullen:   LET ME ANSWER 
20:51:45 YOUR QUESTION, SETTING THE STAGE FOR WHAT KIND OF ANALYSIS WOULD BE DONE.

20:51:49 AGAIN THIS IS -- THE BETTER QUESTION HERE TONIGHT IS I THINK REALLY DO YOU 
20:51:53 SEE MERIT IN THE APPLICATION FOR THE GENERAL PLAN AMENDMENT SCREENING 
20:51:57 PROCESS FOR THE BULLETS ON THAT POLICY, AND ARE YOU

20:52:01 INTERESTED IN THEN MOVING FORWARD TO DO THE ANALYSIS THAT WOULD LEAD TO A 
20:52:04 GENERAL PLAN AMENDMENT?
BUT JUST TO DIG INTO THE ENVIRONMENTAL 
20:52:10 A LITTLE BIT, THE ISSUE, THE MAIN ISSUE WITH THE CREMATORY AS I UNDERSTAND IT 
20:52:19 IS, THERE IS AN INCREASED CANCER RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE BURNERS THAT 
20:52:23 COULD
EITHER BE ABOVE A STANDARD OR BELOW A 
20:52:27 STANDARD DEPENDING ON THE DISTANCE FROM IT AND THE TYPE OF USE AND ET CETERA.

20:52:31 AND AS A TECHNICAL REPORT THAT HAS TO BE RUN, THE CITY WOULD BE INVOLVED 
20:52:37 WITH THAT AS IT RELATES TO LAND USES IN OUR  JURISDICTION, THE BAY AREA AIR 
20:52:39 QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT IS INVOLVED

20:52:43 MORE BROADLY WITH PERMITTING AND I'M SURE THE OWNER OF THAT COULD YOU KNOW, 
20:52:46 COULD TALK AT LENGTH ABOUT THEIR EXPERIENCE OVER THE YEARS WITH THOSE 
20:52:50 PROCESSES.
BUT JUST TO BREAK IT DOWN AGAIN FOR 
20:52:53 OUR PURPOSE.
WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION 
20:52:58 TONIGHT AND WE CAN'T SPECULATE ON WHAT KIND OF IMPACTS WOULD BE ABLE TO BE 
20:53:01 MITIGATED OR NOT MITIGATED.
THAT'S ALL SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE 
20:53:10 LOOKED AT WITH A FORMAL APPLICATION.
>> Commissioner Yee:   ALL  RIGHT, 
20:53:12 COMMISSIONER McDONALD YOU HAVE YOUR HAND RAISED.

20:53:21 >> Commissioner McDonald:   THANK YOU.
JOEL, I DON'T WANT TO PILE ON.

20:53:37 BUT I HAVE A COUPLE OF ISSUES GOING BACK TO THE SAME -- THE THE ISSUE.

20:53:45 ON OSGOOD BETWEEN THAT ROCK AND SAND -- I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY CALL IT, ROCK 
20:53:50 YARD OR STONE  YARD, WHATEVER IT IS.
>> Commissioner Yee:   TRICITY ROCK.

20:53:54 >> Commissioner McDonald:   AND THE GAS PLACE NEXT DOOR AND I'VE HEARD A LOT 
20:54:02 OF COMPLAINTS ABOUT NOISE AND THE POLLUTION COMING FROM THE ROCK TRICITY 
20:54:05 ROCK AND I MEAN THAT ROCK PLACE WAS THERE YEARS

20:54:10 BEFORE THE SCHOOL WAS BUILT AND I'M SURE A STUDY WAS DONE THERE AND THE 
20:54:14 PARENTS ARE STILL COMPLAINING.
SO I MEAN, I KNOW STUDIES ARE BEING 
20:54:20 DONE TO MITIGATE THESE ISSUES, BUT IN THE END, YOU KNOW, THESE THINGS 
20:54:31 HAPPEN.
RIGHT?

20:54:40 SO HOW DO WE MINIMIZE IMOALT KINDS OF IMPACT, ONCE WE APPROVE THIS THEN IT'S 
20:54:44 AN ENTITLEMENT AND WE CAN'T RESTRICT FURTHER.

20:54:48 THAT'S REALLY MY BIGGEST  CONCERN.
I MEAN I THINK THIS APPLICANT IS DOING 
20:54:52 AN AMAZING JOB, OFFERING ALL KINDS OF BENEFITS TO THE COMMUNITY.

20:54:55 I THINK THEY'RE VERY SINCERE IN THEIR, YOU KNOW, INTENT.

20:55:04 AND I HAVE NO QUALMS ABOUT TRYING TO WORK WITH THEM TO TRY TO PROVIDE THE 
20:55:07 BEST FOR THAT  LOT.
I'M JUST WONDERING ESPECIALLY IN THE 
20:55:12 SHORT TERM WHERE THEY -- I MEAN I WOULD ASSUME THAT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BREAK 
20:55:16 GROUND OR TRY TO BREAK GROUND IMMEDIATELY ON HOUSING, THAT THIS IS A 
20:55:19 FINANCIALLY,
YOU KNOW, HIGH HURDLE, I WOULD THINK 
20:55:24 THAT THEY ARE GOING TO USE THE EXISTING FACILITIES TO THE BEST OF THEIR 
20:55:41 ABILITY AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AND I NOID WHEN MR. SUMMER LYNN FIRST SPOKE, 
20:55:47 HE MENTIONED
THEY ARE DID APPLYING FOR AN EMERGENCY 
20:55:49 C.U.P.
I'M SORRY THAT KIND OF CONFUSED ME.

20:55:53 CAN THEY DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT TO MOVE FORWARD IMMEDIATELY?

20:55:57 >> Planner Pullen:   THERE'S A LOT TO UNPACK FROM YOUR QUESTION SO I'LL TRY 
20:56:00 ONE MORE TIME WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL QUESTION BECAUSE I THINK IT'S 
20:56:03 SOMETHING THAT I CAN SEE PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO GET THEIR

20:56:05 MIND AROUND.
AND AGAIN, THE MAIN POINT I WANT TO 
20:56:08 MAKE IS THAT THAT ALL WOULD BE DONE WITH THE FORMAL APPLICATION.

20:56:19 IF YOU WERE INTERESTED IN  BROADLY -- IN THE PROJECT SIDE OR IN THE LAND USE 
20:56:23 OF THE PROPERTY GOING IN A PUBLIC FACILITY TO AN URBAN RESIDENTIAL 
20:56:26 DESIGNATION, AND THEN YOU MAKING YOUR DECISION

20:56:28 TONIGHT WOULD JUST BE SAYING EXPLORE IT.

20:56:32 YOU KNOW SUBMIT AN APPLICATION AND SO IT CAN BE CONSIDERED.

20:56:37 TO BE CLEAR, A SCHOOL ON AN URBAN RESIDENTIAL SITE REQUIRES A C.U.P.

20:56:44 A C.U.P. REQUIRES ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW, REQUIRES BOTH THE ANALYSIS OF THE 
20:56:50 IMPACT OF THE PROJECT ON THE SURROUNDINGS AND ALSO ANALYSIS OF THE 
20:56:53 PROJECTS'S CONFORMANCE WITH THE GENERAL PLAN, GENERAL PLAN

20:56:58 CONTAINS STANDARDS FOR HEALTH SUCH AS MAXIMUM RISK ON THE USE, ET CETERA.

20:57:03 AND THAT'S THE VENUE WHERE WE WOULD GET INTO THESE TECHNICAL ASPECTS AND IT 
20:57:08 MAY BE THAT ULTIMATELY PLANNING COMMISSION COULD CHOOSE TO DENY A 
20:57:12 CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT JUST LIKE YOU DO FOR OTHER USES,

20:57:15 SCHOOLS ARE SUBJECT TO YOUR DISCRETION.

20:57:22 THERE IS NO SUCH THING IN OUR PLANNING RULES AS AN EMERGENCY CONDITIONAL USE 
20:57:27 PERMIT FOR A FACILITY LIKE A SCHOOL TO BE ESTABLISHED.

20:57:31 TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION.
AND CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS ARE 
20:57:36 SUBJECT TO PLANNING COMMISSION REVIEW AND NOT CITY COUNCIL REVIEW, EXCEPT ON 
20:57:40 APPEAL.
AND THEN, THE OTHER PIECE TO YOUR 
20:57:46 QUESTION, YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SORT OF, IT'S ALSO TALKING ABOUT THIS SECOND -- 
20:57:51 THIS SECOND ANALYSIS.
AND I JUST WANT TO COME BACK TO THE 
20:57:57 ANALYSIS TONIGHT IS BY ORDER OF THE GENERAL PLAN SCREENING POLICY, ADOPTED 
20:58:00 BY CITY COUNCIL, IS THAT WE DON'T DO ANALYSIS.

20:58:06 WE ASK YOU IF YOU'RE INTERESTED AND THEN, MOVING FORWARD, TOWNSHIP THEY 
20:58:10  AT WHICH POINT THEY WOULD DO THE ANALYSIS.

20:58:14 I WANTED TO PAINT A LITTLE PICTURE WHAT THAT WOULD LOOK LIKE SO YOU COULD KIND 
20:58:19 OF SEE WHAT WOULD BE THAT NEXT STAGE.
BUT THAT'S THE ANSWER AS RELATES TO 
20:58:23 SCHOOL.
AS RELATES TO HOUSING, SAME THING, 
20:58:27 HOUSING HAS TO BE CONFORMING THE GENERAL PLAN, IT ALSO HAS TO GO 
20:58:30 THROUGH ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW.
IT DIFFERS ON THE TYPE OF HOUSING WHAT 
20:58:33 KIND OF ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW AND PROCESS AND OWNERSHIP ET CETERA BUT 
20:58:38 THAT'S ALL FOR A LATER CONVERSATION.
RIGHT NOW YOU'RE BEING ASKED TO GIVE 
20:58:41 AN UP OR DOWN RECOMMENDATION ON WHETHER YOU THINK THAT THE APPLICANT SHOULD BE 
20:58:47 ALLOWED TO PROCEED WITH THE GENERAL PLAN AMENDMENT APPLICATION TO URBAN 
20:58:47 
RESIDENTIAL.

20:58:53 >> Commissioner McDonald:    OKAY.
WELL THEN JOEL, I'M CONVINCED THAT I 
20:58:58 THINK THE MERITS OF THIS PROJECT WARRANT FURTHER INVESTIGATION.

20:59:05 AND I WOULD LIKE TO MOVE STAFF'S RECOMMENDATION TO EXPLORE THIS 
20:59:07 PROJECT.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   SECONDED.

20:59:16 >> Commissioner Yee:   OKAY.
SO I'VE GOT A -- WE'RE RIGHT INTO THE 
20:59:19 DELIBERATION SO I GUESS JOEL I HAVE A MOTION AND SECOND.

20:59:24 >> Planner Pullen:   OKAY.
SO THE MOTION ON THE FLOOR BY 
20:59:30 COMMISSIONER McDONALD AND THE SECOND BY COMMISSIONER DAULTON, IS TO MOVE THAT 
20:59:34 THE CITY COUNCIL OR RECOMMEND THE CITY COUNCIL ALLOW THE GENERAL PLAN 
20:59:38 AMENDMENT TO PROCEED.
WHEN I CALL YOUR NAME, FLEECE STATE 
20:59:41 YOUR VOTE.
CHAIR YEE,.

20:59:43 >> Planner Pullen: 
>> Commissioner Daulton:   I'M SORRY.

20:59:46 ARE WE GOING TO HAVE A LITTLE DISCUSSION ABOUT THE MOTION OR DOES 
20:59:48 ANYONE NEED ANY DISCUSSION ABOUT THE MOTION?

20:59:57 I JUST WANTED TO ADD THAT YOU KNOW, WHEN I LOOKED DOWN THE LIST OF THE 
21:00:03 SCREENING POLICY THAT THIS DEFINITELY QUALIFIES IN TERMS OF THE LOCATION.

21:00:10 DID LOCATION PRIORITY DEVELOPMENT PART OF THE SCREENING POLICY AND I THINK 
21:00:19 MYSELF, MY MAIN INTEREST IN THIS PROJECT IS TO SEE SOME HOUSING IN THE 
21:00:22 TOD BEHIND THIS SCHOOL OR SOMEWHERE ASSOCIATED WITH

21:00:25 THIS SCHOOL.
THAT'S WHY I'M INTERESTED IN THIS 
21:00:30 PROJECT.
I MEAN THE SABA PEOPLE ARE GREAT 
21:00:33 PEOPLE AND OBVIOUSLY ARE DOING GREAT WORK WHICH IS ANOTHER CONSIDERATION.

21:00:40 BUT OUR GENERAL PLAN FOR THE THE THE IRVINGTON TOD IS LOOKING FOR HOUSING 
21:00:44 ON THIS LOT ESSENTIALLY AND THE THAT'S WHY I SECONDED THE MOTION.

21:01:01 >> Commissioner Yee:   OKAY, JOEL, ARE YOU THERE?

21:01:03 >> Planner Pullen:   WE'RE GOING TO DO THE VOTE, CHAIR.

21:01:06 ANY OTHER COMMENTS?
>> Commissioner Yee:   I GUESS BEFORE 
21:01:10 WE DO THAT I'M GUESSING THAT YOU CLARIFIED THAT EVEN IF WE DECIDE TO GO 
21:01:15 FORWARD WITH THIS, THAT THERE WILL BE OTHER CHECKS TO TAKE A LOOK TO SEE 
21:01:18 THAT FROM AN
ENVIRONMENTAL STANDPOINT, IF THINGS 
21:01:35 NEED TO BE CHANGED IN ORDER TO CONFORM.

21:01:37 >> THAT WOULD BE THE SCOPE OF THE VOTE.

21:01:41 I'LL CONTINUE WITH THE VOTE.
WHEN I CALL YOUR NAME PLEASE STATE 
21:01:46 YOUR VOTE, BEGINNING WITH CHAIR YEE.
>> Commissioner Yee:   YES.

21:01:49 >> Planner Pullen:   VICE CHAIR RAO IS ABSENT.

21:01:55 THIS IS A VOTE RECOMMENDING THE GENERAL PLAN AMENDMENT BE ACCEPTED AND ABLE TO 
21:01:58 PROCEED.
VICE CHAIR RAO IS ABSENT.

21:02:03 COMMISSIONER McDONALD.
>> Commissioner McDonald:   AYE.

21:02:05 >> Planner Pullen:   COMMISSIONER STECKLER.

21:02:08 de AYE.
>> Planner Pullen:   COMMISSIONER 
21:02:11 CARDENAS.
>> Commissioner Cardenas:   YES LET'S 
21:02:15 EXPLORE IT.
>> Planner Pullen:   COMMISSIONER 
21:02:17 DAULTON.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   AYE.

21:02:24 >> Planner Pullen:   AND COMMISSIONER LIU.

21:02:29 >> Commissioner Liu:   AYE.
>> Planner Pullen:   THE COUNCIL WOULD 
21:02:35 HEAR THIS ITEM TENTATIVELY SCHEDULED FOR THIS HEARING IN SEPTEMBER.

21:02:38 AND THEN THEY WOULD MAKE THE FINAL DECISION.

21:02:40 BACK TO YOU CHAIR.
>> Commissioner Yee:   ALL RIGHT, 
21:02:42 THANK YOU.
SO LET'S I GUESS WITH THAT LET'S MOVE 
21:02:49 ON TO THE NEXT ITEM ON OUR AGENDA.
WOULD YOU PLEASE READ THAT AGENDA 
21:02:51 ITEM?
THE SECOND ONE, JOEL?

21:02:55 >> Planner Pullen:   YES CHAIR.
SO ITEM 2 TONIGHT IS THE AFFORDABLE 
21:03:00 HOUSING ORDINANCE UPDATE.
THIS IS A CITYWIDE PROJECT UPDATE OUR 
21:03:04 ORDINANCE.
IT IS TO CONSIDER AN UPDATE OF THE 
21:03:09 AFFORDABLE HOUSING ORDINANCE WHICH IS IN FREMONT MUNICIPAL CODE CHAPTER 18.1 
21:03:14 GIEF AND TO CONSIDER EXEMPTIONS FROM THE REQUIREMENTS OF CEQA, BASED ON 
21:03:20 CEQA GUIDELINE
SECTION 15.162 AND 15.183 AND ALSO 
21:03:29 SCWAZ GUIDELINES SECTION 15.061B 3 THE GENERAL RECOMMENDED ACTION.

21:03:35 THE RECOMMENDATION SO RECOMMEND ZONING ACTION TO THE CITY COUNCIL.

21:03:42 HERE TO GIVE PRESENTATIONS IS PLANNER HUGHES YAH HUGHES AND THE DIRECTOR OF 
21:03:51 COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT DAN S SCHOENHOLZ.

21:04:00 >> Dan Schoenholz:   I'LL TAKE THAT AS A QUEUE TO GET STARTED.

21:04:09 AS WAS MENTIONED, I'M IS DANNY SCHOENHOLZ.

21:04:23  KEYSER-MARSTON IS ALSO WITH US TONIGHT.

21:04:28 I'LL GO OVER BACKGROUND AND HISTORY RELATED TO THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING 
21:04:32 ORDINANCE AND DESCRIBE THE DIRECTION THAT STAFF RECEIVED FROM CITY COUNCIL 
21:04:36 AT WORK SESSION EARLIER THIS YEAR AND THEN LUCIA WILL

21:04:40 GO THROUGH THE REVISIONS BEING PROPOSED AND THE NEXT STEPS AND THEN WE'LL LOOK 
21:04:42 FORWARD TO YOUR QUESTIONS AND YOUR FEEDBACK.

21:04:54 NEXT SLIDE PLEASE.
WE WANTED TO PROVIDE A HISTORY OF 
21:04:57 FREMONT'S AFFORDABLE HOUSING ORDINANCE JUST TO SET SOME CONTEXT.

21:05:02 PRIOR TO 2002, THE CITY DIDN'T REQUIRE NEW MARKET RATE PROJECTS TO PROVIDE 
21:05:05 ANY AFFORDABLE UNITS OR AFFORDABLE HOUSING FEES.

21:05:12 UNTIL THAT TIME, AFFORDABLE HOUSING WAS FUNDED IN FREMONT THROUGH SUBSIDIES 
21:05:15 FROM THE REDEVELOPMENT AGENCY AND THROUGH VARIOUS STATE AND FEDERAL  
21:05:21 FUNDING PROGRAMS.
THEN IN 2002, THE CITY'S FIRST 
21:05:25 INCLUSIONARY HOUSING ORDINANCE WAS ADOPTED AND IT REQUIRED RESIDENTIAL 
21:05:30 PROJECTS WITH SEVEN OR MORE UNITS TO RESERVE 15% OF THE UNITS AS 
21:05:36 A AFFORDABLE.
AND UNDER THAT ORDINANCE BETWEEN 2002 
21:05:42 AND 2010, 343 MODERATE INCOME OWNERSHIP HOUSING UNITS WERE PRODUCED UNDER THE 
21:05:47 ORDINANCE.
THEN, IN 2010, THE CITY COUNCIL 
21:05:51 ADOPTED A REVISED ORDINANCE, IT WAS RENAMED THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING 
21:05:58 ORDINANCE, AND THIS REVISED ORDINANCE ALLOWED FOR PAYMENT OF FEES IN LIEU OF 
21:06:00 PROVIDING ONSITE
UNITS.

21:06:05 AND THE GOAL WAS TO PROVIDE MORE FLEXIBILITY TO DEVELOPERS AND ALSO TO 
21:06:10 MAKE POSSIBLE GENERATING FUNDING FOR LOWER INCOME PROJECTS RATHER THAN 
21:06:17 CREATING MODERATE INCOME UNITS ONLY.
THIS ORDINANCE WAS ADOPTED KIND OF 
21:06:22 RIGHT IN THE THICK OF THE GREAT RECESSION AND SO THERE WASN'T A LOT OF 
21:06:26 CONSTRUCTION GOING AN DURING THE LIFE OF THE ORDINANCE BUT THIS VERSION OF 
21:06:30 THE ORDINANCE DID
RESULTS IN A FEW ONSITE UNITS BEING 
21:06:36 PRODUCED AS WELL AS GENERATING SEVERAL MILLION DOLLARS THAT HELPED FUND 75 
21:06:41 OFFSITE AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS.
THEN IN 2012, THE STATE ELIMINATED 
21:06:45 REDEVELOPMENT.
WHICH TOOK AWAY WHAT, AT THE TIME, WAS 
21:06:51 THE MAIN FUNDING SOURCE FOR SUBSIDIZING LARGE MULTIFAMILY AFFORDABLE 
21:06:56 PROJECTS.
NEXT SLIDE PLEASE.

21:07:03 IN 2015, THE ORDINANCE WAS UPDATED ONCE AGAIN AND ONE OF THE MOTIVATIONS WAS 
21:07:08 TO INCREASE FEES AS MUCH AS WAS LEGALLY JUSTIFIABLE, TO HELP US MEET OUR 
21:07:11 AFFORDABLE HOUSING NEEDS, AND THIS WAS ESPECIALLY

21:07:16 IMPORTANT SINCE WE NO LONGER HAD REDEVELOPMENT, TO FUND THE DEVELOPMENT 
21:07:20 OF LOWER INCOME UNITS.
ANOTHER GOAL, WHEN IT WAS  ADOPTED, 
21:07:26 WAS TO TRY AND DESIGN THE ORDINANCE TO NOT ONLY GENERATED REVENUES BUT IT 
21:07:33 ALSO ENCOURAGED SOME DEVELOPMENT OF MODERATE INCOME UNITS, A HYBRID 
21:07:35 OPTION
WHERE THEY COULD PRODUCE MODERATE 
21:07:41 INCOME UNITS AND PAY A LOWER FEE RATHER THAN PAYING FEES ONLY OR BUILDING 
21:07:46 INCLUSIONARY UNITS ONLY.
WE ALSO STRUCTURED THE 2015 ORDINANCE 
21:07:54 IN RECOGNITION OF A COUPLE OF COURT CASES AT THAT TIME THAT HAD THROWN 
21:08:00 INTO QUESTION THE CITY'S ABILITY TO INCLUDE INCLUSIONARY UNITS AT ALL.

21:08:04 THIS LED TO BE VERY COMPLEX AS WE TRIED TO WORK AROUND THE RESTRICTIONS IN 
21:08:09 THESE VARIOUS LEGAL ACTIONS.
FORTUNATELY SINCE 2015 THE LEGAL 
21:08:14 LANDSCAPE HAS BEEN CLARIFIED AS COURTS AND THE STATE LEGISLATURE HAVE FIRMLY 
21:08:18 ESTABLISHED THE ABILITY OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO REQUIRE INCLUSIONARY 
21:08:23 UNITS.
SO THE CITY NOW HAS MORE DISCRETION IN 
21:08:27 OUR CURRENT UPDATE TO SIMPLIFY THE ORDINANCE AND DETERMINE WHAT OPTIONS 
21:08:32 WE WANT TO INCLUDE.
I WOULD NOTE THAT THE CURRENT VERSION 
21:08:43 OF THE ORDINANCE MASS RESULTED IN THE CREATION OF 846 AFFORDABLE UNITS 
21:08:48 BETWEEN 2018 AND 2020, WITH HUNDREDS MORE IN THE PIPELINE, SO IT'S BEEN 
21:08:52 QUITE SUCCESSFUL
RELATIVE TO OTHER VERSIONS EVIDENT 
21:08:54 ORDINANCE.
MOST OF THE ARE UNITS HAVE BEEN 
21:09:03 TARGETED TO LOW EXTREMELY LOW AND VERY LOW RESIDENTS AND MANY FEW MODERATE 
21:09:06 INCOME UNITS HAVE BEEN PRODUCED.
THAT'S A BIT OF BACKGROUND.

21:09:09 WHEN COUNCIL GAVE US DIRECTION TO INITIATE THE CURRENT UPDATE OF THE 
21:09:11 PLAN, WE ESTABLISHED A FEW BASIC GOALS.

21:09:16 ONE WAS TO INCREASE RESOURCES FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING, ANOTHER WAS TO 
21:09:21 REFLECT THE UPDATED LEGAL FRAMEWORK AND THE THIRD WAS TO CLARIFY AND SIMPLIFY 
21:09:25 THE ORDINANCE WHERE WE COULD.
NEXT SLIDE, PLEASE.

21:09:32 SO AS A FIRST STEP IN THE UPDATE PROCESS WE COMMISSIONED A NEXUS STUDY 
21:09:38 AND A FINANCIAL FEASIBILITY STUDY TO GET A SENSE OF WHAT LEVEL OF 
21:09:41 AFFORDABLE HOUSING REQUIREMENTS ARE RELATED TO NEW DEVELOPMENT

21:09:47 AND CAN FEASIBLY BE CHARGED.
THEN WE HELD A STAKEHOLDER MEETING 
21:09:50 LAST OCTOBER AND WORK SESSIONS WITH PLANNING COMMISSION AND THEN WITH THE 
21:09:58 CITY COUNCIL TO PRESENT THESE STUDIES.
NEXT SLIDE PLEASE.

21:10:01 AT THE CITY COUNCIL WORK SESSION IN FEBRUARY WE GOT CLEAR DIRECTION THAT 
21:10:07 COUNCIL WANTED TO RETAIN THE ABILITY FOR DEVELOPERS TO PAY FEES IN LIEU OF 
21:10:14 PRODUCTION OF ONSITE UNITS.
SINCE FEES OF SUBSIDIZED PRODUCTION OF 
21:10:19 LOWER INCOME RENTAL UNITS AND ANOTHER IMPORTANT POINT IS THAT  FEE-SUPPORTED 
21:10:23 PROJECTS, THESE LARGER MULTIFAMILY RENTAL PROJECTS ALSO TYPICALLY 
21:10:27 LEVERAGE IN
LARGE AMOUNTS OF COUNTY, STATE AND 
21:10:29 FEDERAL DOLLARS INTO THE COMMUNITY AND HELP COVER THE COST OF THE AFFORDABLE 
21:10:33 HOUSING.
WHEREAS INCLUSIONARY OWNERSHIP UNITS 
21:10:38 DO NOT.
COUNCIL ALSO SUPPORTED  INCREASING FEE 
21:10:43 LEVELS TO THE EXTENT FEASIBLE, TO INCREASE THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE FOR 
21:10:47 AFFORDABLE HOUSING PRODUCTION.
THEY SUPPORTED A PHASE-IN OF THE NEW 
21:10:51 REQUIREMENTS THE GIVE THE MARKET TIME TO ADJUST, THEY ALSO WANTED US TO 
21:10:57 RETAIN THE MANY OPTIONS THAT EXIST IN THE CURRENTS ORDINANCE, FOR EXAMPLE, 
21:11:00 LAND DONATION AS
A WAY TO MEET THE ORDINANCE 
21:11:03 REQUIREMENTS.
THEY WANTED TO CONTINUE TO INCENTIVIZE 
21:11:09 SMALLER MARKET-RATE RENTAL UNITS BY DISCOUNTING FEES ON THOSE UNITS.

21:11:13 AND FINALLY, THEY DIRECTED US TO SIMPLIFY AND CLARIFY THE ORDINANCE 
21:11:15 WHERE POSSIBLE.
SO THAT'S THE DIRECTION THAT WE 
21:11:22 RECEIVED AND NOW, WE'LL WALK YOU THROUGH THE ORDINANCE CONSISTENT WITH 
21:11:27 THAT DIRECTION.
I'LL TURN IT OVER TO LUCIA.

21:11:29 >> THANK YOU DAN.
I'M GOING TO WALK YOU THROUGH REST OF 
21:11:34 THE PRESENTATION.
USING COUNCIL DIRECTION, AS OUR DPRAIM 
21:11:40 WORK, WE CAME UP WITH THE FOLLOWING PROPOSED REVISIONS.

21:11:45 THESE REVISIONS WERE PRESENTED TO OPUBLIC STAKEHOLDERS ON JULY 21st.

21:11:52 I WILL SHARE STAKEHOLDERS  FEEDBACK LATER ON IN THE PRESENTATION.

21:11:55 THERE ARE THE TWO MAIN OPTIONS UNDER THE ORDINANCE.

21:12:00 PAY THE IN-LIEU FEES OR BUILD INCLUSIONARY UNITS.

21:12:05 COUNCIL'S DIRECTION IS TO GENERATE RESOURCES FOR THE PRODUCTION OF 
21:12:09 AFFORDABLE RENTAL UNITS FOR LOWER INCOME HOUSEHOLDS SO WE ARE PROPOSING 
21:12:14 TO KEEP THE THE FULL IN LIEU FEES OPTION, BUT INCREASE THE IN

21:12:19 LIEU FEES FOR FOR-SALE PROJECTS EXCEPT STACKED FLATS.

21:12:24 COUNCIL ALSO DIRECTED STAFF TO INCREASE THE FEES IN PHASES .

21:12:30 AS YOU CAN SEE, ON THE SLIDE, OUR CURRENT FEE FOR SINGLE FAMILY IS $20 
21:12:50  $26 PER UNITS, FOR STACKED FLATS THE FEE IS $27 PER STACKED FLAT.

21:12:55 THE PROPOSED IS 35, THROUGH ADOPTION OF THIS ORDINANCE THROUGH DECEMBER 2022.

21:13:01 FEE WOULD INCREASE TO $44 PER SQUARE FOOT STARTING IN JANUARY 2023, THROUGH 
21:13:07 THE DURATION OF THE ORDINANCE.
THE PROPOSED FEES ARE BASED ON THE 
21:13:14 FEASIBILITY STUDY WHICH SHOW THAT MOST OWNERSHIP UNITS CAN ABSORB FEES OF $44 
21:13:19 TO $50 PER SQUARE FOOT DEPENDING ON PRODUCT TYPE.

21:13:23 WE ARE PROPOSING THAT FOR ALL FOR SALE HOMES OTHER THAN STACKED FLATS, BE 
21:13:30 CHARGED THE SAME RATE AT $44 PER SQUARE FOOT AFTER (INAUDIBLE) FOR THE EASE OF 
21:13:32 ADMINISTRATION AND TO KEEP THE MAXIMUM FEE

21:13:35 CLOSER TO THE MAXIMUM FEE IN COMPARABLE JURISDICTIONS.

21:13:43 FOR STACKED FLATS THE FEE WOULD REMAIN THE SAME AT THE CURRENT RATE OF 27 PER 
21:13:46 SQUARE FOOT THROUGH THE DURATION OF THE ORDINANCE.

21:13:51 THE FEASIBILITY STUDY FINDS THAT STACKED FLATS PROJECTS CANNOT ABSORB 
21:13:58 HIGHER FEES.
CONTINUING WITH THE PAYMENT OF IN LIEU 
21:14:04 FEE OPTION, WE ARE PROPOSING A FEE -- WE ARE NOT PROPOSING A FEE INCREASE 
21:14:09 FOR RENTAL PROJECTS.
THEREFORE, THE FEE FOR RENTAL PROJECTS 
21:14:14 WITHOUT SUBDIVISION MAP WOULD REMAIN THE SAME FOR THE ENTIRE DURATION OF 
21:14:20 THE  ORDINANCE.
AT THE CURRENT RATE OF $17.50 PER 
21:14:23 SQUARE FOOT CONSISTENT WITH THE FEASIBILITY STUDY WHICH DETERMINED 
21:14:27 THAT HIGHER FEE FOR RENTAL PROJECTS IS INFEASIBLE.

21:14:32 WE ARE ALSO INCENTIVIZING THE PRODUCTION OF SMALLER UNITS IN 
21:14:38 ACCORDANCE WITH COUNCIL'S DIRECTION.
SO THE FEE FOR UNITS LESS THAN 700 
21:14:42 SQUARE FEET REMAINS AT  $EIGHT.75 PER SQUARE FOOT.

21:14:54  $8.75 PER SQUARE FOOT.
FEES WILL HAVE A FEE OF $27 PER SQUARE 
21:15:00 FOOT FOR THE ENTIRE TIME, AS THEY ARE CONSIDERED.

21:15:06 IN SUMMARY, WEE ARE NOT PROPOSING TO RAISE FEES ON RENTAL PROJECTS OR 
21:15:12 STACKED FLAT PROJECTS.
OUR OTHER MAIN OPTIONS UNDER THE 
21:15:15 ORDINANCE IS THE PRODUCTION OF INCLUSIONARY UNITS.

21:15:23 OUR CURRENT ORDINANCE ALLOWS DEVELOPERS TO PROVIDE HOME OWNERSHIP UNITS FOR 
21:15:30 LOWER INCOME HOUSEHOLDS, THE TOTAL PERCENTAGE OF INCLUSIONARY 
21:15:37 E-INCLUSIONARY UNITS CAN RANGE FROM 26 PER  DEATTACHED UNITS,

21:15:40  HOWEVER THIS OPTION HAS NEVER BEEN USED.

21:15:44 BASED ON ARE DEVELOPERS FEED IMPACT THE COST IS TOO HIGH DUE TO BOTH THE 
21:15:50 PERCENTAGE REQUIRED AND THE REQUIREMENT THAT INCLUSIONARY UNITS BE AFFORDABLE 
21:15:54 TO EXTREMELY LOW AND VERY LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS.

21:16:02 WE ARE PROPOSING A 15% ONSITE REQUIREMENT FOR FOR-SALE PROJECTS, 5% 
21:16:10 AT MODERATE UP TO  120% AREA MEDIAN INCOME AND 10% AT LOW INCOME UP TO 80% 
21:16:14 AREA MEDIAN INCOME.
AS YOU CAN SEE, WE TOOK AWAY THE 
21:16:18 DISTINCTION BETWEEN ATTACHED AND DETACHED UNITS.

21:16:23 WE BELIEVE THIS PROPOSED INCLUSIONARY REQUIREMENT IS SIMPLER AND MORE 
21:16:29  STRAIGHTFORWARD, AND THE 15% INCLUSIONARY REQUIREMENT IS 
21:16:36 REASONABLE, IS DEEMED REASONABLE BY THE STATE AND

21:16:38 GENERALLY CONSISTENT WITH OTHER BAY AREA CITIES.

21:16:43 WHITE THE FEASIBILITY STUDY DID NOT CONSIDER THE FEASIBILITY OF PROVIDING 
21:16:49 A MIX OF MODERATE AND LOW INCOME UNITS, IT DID DETERMINE THAT FOR SALE TOWN 
21:16:53 HOMES AND SINGLE FAMILY PROJECTS COULD ABSORB A

21:17:04 MODERATE INCOME, A MODERATE INCOME UNIT OF UP TO 20%.

21:17:08 FOR RENTAL PROJECTS, THE CURRENT BASIC YOU REQUIREMENT IS TO PAY THE 
21:17:12 AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN LIEU FEE.
THE LEGAL LANDSCAPE HAS CHANGED SINCE 
21:17:18 THE ADOPTION OF THE CURRENT ORDINANCE, WHICH ALLOWS CITIES TO REQUIRE 
21:17:24 INCLUSIONARY RENTAL UNITS, THEREFORE WE ARE PROPOSING A 10% ONSITE REQUIREMENT 
21:17:28 FOR LOW
INCOME  UNITS.

21:17:32 IN KEEPING WITH THE CURRENT ORDINANCE, VARIATIONS OF LOWER INCOME UNITS THAT 
21:17:37 PROVIDE DEEPER AFFORDABILITY OR HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF AFFORDABLE UNITS WOULD 
21:17:40 BE CONSIDERED.
ALTHOUGH THE FEASIBILITY STUDY 
21:17:46 INDICATES ONLY A 5% LOW INCOME INCLUSIONARY REQUIREMENT IS FEASIBLE, 
21:17:51 FOR RENTAL PROJECTS, STAFF BELIEVES THAT RENTAL DEVELOPER WOULD CHOOSE TO 
21:17:55 PAY THE IN LIEU FEE AT A
FEE LEVEL THAT IS FEASIBLE AND IS THE 
21:17:59 SAME AS WE'VE HAD FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS.

21:18:04 MOREOVER, IF MARKET RATE CONDITIONS CHANGE AND INCLUSIONARY UNITS BECOME A 
21:18:09 REALISTIC OPTION FOR RENTAL DEVELOPERS, HAVING A 10% REQUIREMENT IN PLACE 
21:18:12 WOULD RESULT IN A MORE SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF LOW

21:18:17 INCOME UNITS.
LASTLY:  I LIKE TO NOTE THAT ANY 
21:18:22 INCLUSIONARY REQUIREMENTS FOR RENTAL PROJECTS IN EXCESS OF 15% IS SUBJECT 
21:18:28 TO POTENTIAL REVIEW BY THE STATE TO ENSURE THAT IT WOULD NOT SUPPRESS 
21:18:29 DEVELOPMENT OF MARKET
RATE HOUSING.

21:18:35 SO THE PROPOSED 10% REQUIREMENT WOULD NOT TRIGGER REVIEW BY THE STATE.

21:18:42 THE FULL IN-LIEU FEE AND THE OPTION ARE THE TWO MAIN OPTIONS IN THE 
21:18:45 ORDINANCE.
NOW LET'S MOVE ON TO REVISIONS TO 
21:18:53 OTHER ALTERNATIVES.
REVISIONS TO THE HYPE UH HYBRID 
21:18:56 OPTION.
THE HYBRID OPTION ALLOWS FOR FOR SALE 
21:19:03 PROJECTS TO PROVIDE ON SITE MODERATE UNITS AND PAY IN LIEU FEES FOR LOW 
21:19:07 INCOME UNITS.
THE SECOND COLUMN DEPICTS THE CURRENT 
21:19:10 COMBINATION IN SITE AND IN LIEU FEE REQUIREMENTS.

21:19:15 UNDER THE PROPOSED OPTION, DEVELOPERS WOULD BE ALLOWED TO PROVIDE 5% 
21:19:20 MODERATE ONSITE AND PAY IN LIEU FEES FOR THE LOW INCOME UNITS AS FOLLOWS.

21:19:25 $20 PER SQUARE FOOT FOR SINGLE FAMILY AND TOWN HOMES FROM ADOPTION OF THE 
21:19:31 ORDINANCE TO DECEMBER, 2022.
THE FEE WOULD GO UP TO $29 PER SQUARE 
21:19:35 FOOT FROM JANUARY 2023 THROUGH THE DURATION OF THE ORDINANCE.

21:19:43 FOR STACKED FLATS WE ARE PROPOSING AN IN LIEU FEE OF $12 PER SQUARE FOOT 
21:19:47 DURING THE LIFE OF THE ORDINANCE.
THE FEASIBILITY STUDY HAS CONCLUDED 
21:19:50 THAT HIGHER FEE FOR STACKED FLATS IS INFEASIBLE.

21:19:57 THE FEE SAVINGS REALIZED BY THOSE EXERCISING THE HYBRID OPTION IS $15 
21:20:03 PER SQUARE FOOT BASED ON ESTIMATES BY THE CITY'S ECONOMIC CONSULTANTS THAT A 
21:20:10  THAT A $15 PER SQUARE FEE IS APPROXIMATELY

21:20:14 EQUIVALENT TO THE COST OF PROVIDING THE FIVE PER MODERATE INCOME UNITS.

21:20:24  5% MODERATE INCOMES.
WEE ARE ALSO PROPOSING, THE VOLUNTARY 
21:20:30 REVISION OF RENTAL UNITS.
THE CURRENT PROJECT, BOTH FOR SALE AND 
21:20:33 RENTAL UNITS TO FULT FILL THEIR OBLIGATION OPPORTUNITY ORDINANCE BY 
21:20:39 PROVIDING AFFORDABLE RENTAL UNITS.
FOR EXAMPLE, SEVERAL LARGE DEVELOPMENT 
21:20:44 -- RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS IN WARM SPRINGS, THE CURRENTS REQUIREMENT 
21:20:49 IS 13.4%.
WHICH IS MADE UP OF EXTREMELY LOW, 
21:20:54 VERY LOW AND MODERATE INCOME UNITS.
WE ARE PROPOSING THAT THESE PROJECTS 
21:20:58 CAN FULFILL THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING ORDINANCE REQUIREMENTS BY RENTAL, BY 
21:21:06 PROVIDING RENTAL UNITS AT 7.5% LOW INCOME AND 7.5% AT VERY LOW INCOME FOR 
21:21:11 A TOTAL OF 15%
SET  ASIDE RENTAL UNITS TO ALIGN WITH 
21:21:15 THE PROPOSED 15% FOR SALE PROJECTS AND FOR THE EASE OF ADMINISTRATION.

21:21:24 NOW I WANT TO TOUCH ON SOME CLARIFICATIONS AND MINOR CHANGES 
21:21:30 PROPOSED BY STAFF AS A RESULT OF CHALLENGES AND LESSONS LEARNED FROM 
21:21:32 THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE CURRENT ORDINANCE.

21:21:37 TIMING AND PERFORMANCE.
FOR PROJECTS THAT INCLUDE ONSITE 
21:21:42 MARKET RATE AND AFFORDABLE  UNITS, STAFF WANTS TO CLARIFY THAT THE 
21:21:49 CONSTRUCTION TIMING AND OCCUPANCY OF THE AFFORDABLE UNITS SHOULD BE 
21:21:53 
PROPORTIONAL OF THE MARKET UNITS.

21:21:58 THE APPROVAL BODY MAY MOVIE THE TIMING REQUIREMENTS IF IT DETERMINES THAT 
21:22:01 GREATER PUBLIC BENEFITS WOULD RESULT FROM THE MODIFICATION.

21:22:09 IN THIS CASE, THE CITY MAY REQUIRE THAT THE COMPLETION OF OF AFFORDABLE UNITS 
21:22:14 BE FURTHER SECURED BY THE APPLICANT AGREEMENT TO PAY THE IN LIEU FEES.

21:22:22 THIS WOULD ALLOW THE PROJECTS -- WILL PAY THE IN LIEU FEES OWED TO THE CITY 
21:22:24 IN THE THEEFNT THERE ARE CHANGES OR PROBLEMS WITH THE DEVELOPMENT.

21:22:27 THE CITY'S AFFORDABLE HOUSING INTEREST WOULD BE PROTECTED.

21:22:37 ANOTHER CHANGE THAT STAFF WANTS TO MAKE IS TO FURTHER CLARIFY THE REQUIREMENTS 
21:22:42 IF AN APPLICANT DESIRES TO MODIFY THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING PLAN AFTER PROJECT 
21:22:47 APPROVAL.
AND APPLICANT FOR THE FIRST APPROVAL 
21:22:51 OF THE RESIDENTIAL PROJECTS INCLUDES AN AFFORDABLE HOUSING PLAN DESCRIBING HOW 
21:22:54 THE PROJECT WILL COMPLY WITH THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING ORDINANCE.

21:23:02 BECAUSE THE ORIGINAL AFFORDABLE HOUSING PLAN MAY HAVE INFLUENCED THE APPROVAL 
21:23:06 BODY'S DECISION ON APPROVING THE PROJECT STAFF IS PROPOSING THAT 
21:23:09 MODIFICATIONS TO THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING PLAN, AFTER

21:23:12 PROJECTS APPROVAL, WOULD NEED TO BE REVIEWED BY THE APPROVAL BODY.

21:23:19 ANY PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING PLAN MUST BE 
21:23:23 APPROVED BY THE APPROVAL BODY PRIOR TO BUILDING PERMIT ISSUANCE.

21:23:31 THIS CONCLUDES THE PROPOSED REVISION SECTION OF THE PRESENTATION.

21:23:36 WE BELIEVE THESE PROPOSED REVISIONS WOULD HELP THE CITY ACHIEVE THE GOAL 
21:23:42 OF PROMOTING HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL ECONOMIC SEGMENTS OF OUR COMMUNITY 
21:23:44 WITHOUT SUPPRESSING THE CONSTRUCTION OF MARKET

21:23:48 RATE HOUSING.
A MORE DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ALL OF 
21:23:53 THE PROPOSED CHANGES TO THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING ORDINANCE IS INCLUDED AS 
21:24:03 ATTACHMENT B OF YOUR AGENDA PACKET.
DURING THIS ORDINANCE REVISION PROCESS 
21:24:09 STAFF HAS HELD TWO PUBLIC MEETINGS, I SHOULD SAY TWO PUBLIC STAKEHOLDER 
21:24:12 MEETINGS IN ADDITION TO PRESENTATIONS TO PLANNING COMMISSION AND CITY 
21:24:17 COUNCIL.
STAKEHOLDERS INPUT IS SUMMARIZED ON 
21:24:21 THE SLIDE.
IN A NUTSHELL, MARKET RATE DEVELOPERS 
21:24:27 WANT THE CITY TO RETAIN THE FEE OPTION, KEEP ALL OF THE ALTERNATIVES, MINIMIZE 
21:24:33 FEE LEVELS, PHASE IN OF FEE INCREASES AND LOWER THE INCLUSIONARY 
21:24:37 REQUIREMENTS.
AFFORDABLE HOUSING ADVOCATES WANT THE 
21:24:42 CITY TO INCREASE THE FEES TO THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT FEASIBLE.

21:24:47 ONE COMMUNITY MEMBER WANTS INCLUSIONARY REQUIREMENTS FOR FOR SALE MODERATE 
21:24:52 INCOME UNITS.
FINALLY, I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE WITH 
21:24:57 YOU THE NEXT STEPS NET AFFORDABLE HOUSING ORDINANCE PROCESS.

21:25:03 COUNCIL HEARING IS SCHEDULED FOR EARLY OCTOBER, AND COUNCIL ADOPTION WILL 
21:25:07 HAPPEN AROUND NOVEMBER.
AT WHICH TIME THE ORDINANCE WILL BE 
21:25:15 EFFECTIVE.
THIS CONCLUDES OUR PRESENTATION.

21:25:17 WITH THAT WE'LL OPEN IT UP FOR QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS.

21:25:23 THANK YOU.
>> Commissioner Yee:   THANK  YOU.

21:25:32 WITH THAT, ANY CLARIFYING QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMISSION ON WHAT WAS JUST 
21:25:34 PRESENTED?
OKAY.

21:25:38 IT LOOKS LIKE NOBODY'S RAISED THEIR HAND.

21:25:49 OKAY SO -- OH, TAKE THAT BACK.
COMMISSIONER McDONALD.

21:25:52 >> Commissioner McDonald:    OKAY, LOTS OF QUESTIONS.

21:25:58 OKAY, I'M REALLY, FIRST OF ALL, THANK YOU TO THE STAFF FOR DOING THIS 
21:26:03 TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF WORK.
IT SEEMS IT'S BEEN WHAT, TWO YEARS CAN 
21:26:07 OF STUDYING THIS  ISSUE.
AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT YOU'VE 
21:26:13 TAKEN ANY PUT FROM SO MANY DIFFERENT BODIES TO COME UP WITH SOME KIND OF 
21:26:16 SOLUTION.
I THINK EVERYTHING THAT WE'RE DOING IN 
21:26:26 FREMONT TO PROVIDE MORE HOUSING IS IS KIND OF   REMARKABLE, ESPECIALLY IN 
21:26:28 LIGHT OF THIS LAST APPLICANT WHO IS WILLING TO GO

21:26:37 ON THEIR OWN TO PROVIDE HOUSING FOR THEIR COMMUNITY.

21:26:42 COUPLE OF QUESTIONS I HAD.
ONE IS THAT THERE WAS A REFERENCE TO 
21:26:47 THE $50 MAXIMUM  FEE.
AND I WAS WONDERING WHO OR WHAT TYPE 
21:26:54 OF HOUSING COULD ABSORB THAT FEE AND WHY WE DID NOT GO FOR THE MAXIMUM FEE 
21:27:01 ON THAT END?
BECAUSE I'M THINKING THAT WE'RE 
21:27:04 PROBABLY NOT GOING TO GO THROUGH THIS TREMENDOUS PROCESS AGAIN IN THE NEAR 
21:27:11 FUTURE AND I'D LIKE TO AVOID THAT BRACKET OF TIME WHERE WE MIGHT ANY THE 
21:27:17 
INADVERTENTLY BE DISCOUNTINGS THE FEE, 
21:27:23 BUT THERE'S SOME WINDOW WHERE THEY COULD AFFORD MORE AND WE ARE NOT 
21:27:30 BUDGING IT.
THAT WOULD BE MY FIRST QUESTION.

21:27:34 >> Dan Schoenholz:   I'LL TAKE THAT FIRST QUESTION COMMISSIONER McDONALD.

21:27:39 IT'S KIND OF SLICE ISED AND  DICED INTO SMALL SEGMENTS AND THERE ARE A LOT OF 
21:27:43 SORT OF DIFFERENT DEFINITIONS THAT KIND OF IN REAL LIFE THEY SORT OF BLEED 
21:27:45 INTO EACH OTHER AND THAT'S I THINK WHAT OUR

21:27:50 CONCERN WAS AROUND THE TOWN HOME DEFINITION AND THE SINGLE FAMILY HOME 
21:27:54 DEFINITION.
THERE'S SORT OF A CONTINUUM OF PRODUCT 
21:27:57 TYPES.
AND SOMETIMES IT'S HARD TO DEFINE 
21:28:06 EXACTLY WHAT A HOME IS, WHETHER IT'S A TOWN HOME OR SINGLE FAMILY HOME.

21:28:12 WE JUST THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A LOT EASIER TO IMPLEMENT IF WE HAD ONLY ONE 
21:28:16 CATEGORY AND IN THAT CASE WE WANTED TO BE CONSERVATIVE AND JUST AIM THE FEE 
21:28:21 LEVEL AT THE FEASIBLE LEVEL FOR YOU KNOW THE LOWEST

21:28:26  NUMBER OUT OF THE TWO THE CATEGORIES.
SO THAT WE WEREN'T IN ADVERTENTLY 
21:28:32 SUPPRESSING MARKET RATE DEVELOPMENT IN SOME OF THESE UNIT TYPES .

21:28:40 >> Commissioner McDonald:   SO IS DAN, CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG BUT I THOUGHT 
21:28:43 WE WERE TRYING TO PUSH FOR HIGHER DENSITY DEVELOPMENT.

21:28:48 AND IF THAT IS THE CASE THEN IT WOULD SEEM TO ME THAT THOSE ON THE NEXUS 
21:28:54 REPORT IT BROKE IT OUT TO LARGE LOT SMALL LOT TOWN HOME CONDO AND RENTAL 
21:28:59 RIGHT?
SO I'M WONDERING YOU KNOW IF WE JUST 
21:29:02 RESTRICTED IDENTITY LET'S SAY THE LARGE LOT WHICH IS SOMETHING WE ARE 
21:29:07 SERIOUSLY TRYING TO DISCOURAGE.
COULD THAT POTENTIALLY NET US A FEW 
21:29:12 EXTRA DOLLARS IN FEES ASSUMING THAT THOSE ARE THE ONES THAT CAN REALLY 
21:29:20 AFFORD A LITTLE -- TO PAY A LITTLE BIT MORE?

21:29:23 >> Dan Schoenholz:   SO JUST TO MAKE SLUR IS I UNDERSTAND YOUR QUESTION, 
21:29:30 YOU'RE BASICALLY SAYING DID WE KEPT A $50 FEE FOR SINGLE SYSTEM HOMES WOULD 
21:29:33 WE POTENTIALLY PUSH SOME OF THOSE DEVELOPERS INTO

21:29:35 DOING TOWN HOMES INSTEAD, IS THAT THE QUESTION?

21:29:37 >> Commissioner McDonald:   NO, ONLY THE LARGE LOTS.

21:29:41 JUST THE LARGE-LOT HOMES.
YOU KNOW, WE DON'T -- WE'RE NOT GOING 
21:29:47 TO BE DOING A WHOLE LOT OF THEM BUT THOSE UNITS I WOULD THINK ARE THE ONES 
21:29:49 THAT COULD AFFORD TO PAY $50 A SQUARE FOOT.

21:29:57 SO MY THOUGHT IS THAT I MEAN JUST TO MAXIMIZE OUR POTENTIAL FOR GETTING 
21:30:05 THAT ADDITIONAL FEE.
THOSE UNITS WOULD BE MOST LIKELY TO BE 
21:30:08 ABLE TO PAY THAT, RIGHT?
>> Dan Schoenholz:   YES, SO I'M GOING 
21:30:14 TO ASK DAVID FROM KEYSER-MARSTON, TO MAYBE CHIME IN REGARDING THE 
21:30:18 FEASIBILITY STUDY AND HOW IT DIFFERENTIATED BETWEEN SINGLE FAMILY 
21:30:22 HOMES AND TOWN HOMES AND LOT
SIZES AND HOW THAT MIGHT PLAY OUT.

21:30:33 >> YES, SO WE -- SO I THINK WHAT WE DID WAS, WE RAN THE NEXUS STUDY ON SINGLE 
21:30:38 SYSTEM LARGE LOT AND SMALL LOT TOWN HOMES AND THAT $50 A SQUARE FOOT 
21:30:42 FIGURE THAT YOU'RE REFERENCING, THAT
WAS THE FIGURE FOR THE TOWN HOMES AND 
21:30:46 IT WAS THE 44 THAT WAS FOR THE SINGLE FAMILY.

21:30:53 >> Commissioner McDonald:   OH.
>> SO IT SOUNDS LIKE --

21:30:56 >> Commissioner McDonald:   EVEN ON LARGE LOTS.

21:31:01 
>> YES, DO FIND OUT IF THAT MAXIMUM 
21:31:06 WAS FEASIBLE AND WHAT WE FOUND IN THE CASE OF THAT SINGLE FAMILY THAT $44 
21:31:17 WAS FEASIBLE AND IN THE THE THE TERMS OF TOWN HOME THAT $50 WAS FEELING.

21:31:24 IF YOU WERE TO GO BEYOND THAT NEXUS FINDINGS ABOVE THAT $44 MAXIMUM WE 
21:31:28 DIDN'T SPECIFICALLY TEST THAT BUT WE DID TEST ONSITE INCLUSIONARY UNITS 
21:31:31 THAT WOULD HAVE COST THE PROJECT SOMEWHAT MORE THAN THAT

21:31:35 $44.
SO YOU COULD POTENTIALLY GO ABOVE FROM 
21:31:42 THE FEASIBILITY PERSPECTIVE, ABOVE THAT $44 WITH THE SINGLE FAMILY.

21:31:47 BUT IT WOULD GO BEYOND WHAT WE TESTED IN THE NEXT -- WHAT THE NEXUS MAXIMUM 
21:31:50 SUPPORTED.
>> Commissioner McDonald:   THANK 
21:32:00 YOU.
OKAY I MEAN SO WHY NOT JUST AT LEAST 
21:32:07 APPLIED TO THE TOWN HOMES THEN, CONSIDERING THAT PERHAPS, I MEAN TOWN 
21:32:13 HOMES ARE THE THINGS THAT ARE, YOU KNOW, DILUTING OUR HIGHER DENSITY 
21:32:17 DEVELOPMENT THAT WE'RE
TRYING TO ENCOURAGE.

21:32:20 >> Dan Schoenholz:   YES, AGAIN COMMISSIONER McDONALD, I THINK OUR 
21:32:25 INTENT WAS TO TRY TO SIMPLIFY THE ADMINISTRATION AND AVOID ARGUMENTS 
21:32:29 OVER WHAT THE DEFINITION WAS, DIFFERENT KINDS OF PRODUCT TYPES.

21:32:33 YOU COULD CERTAINLY DO THAT.
YOU COULD YOU KNOW WE HAVE I THINK THE 
21:32:38 -- WE HAVE BACKUP TO SAY THAT TOWN HOMES CAN AFFORD THE $50 FEE.

21:32:42 AND THEN IT WOULD BE, YOU KNOW, WE WOULD ANTICIPATE THAT WE'LL HAVE 
21:32:48 INSTANCES WHERE, YOU KNOW, THERE WILL BE A LOT OF DISCUSSION AND 
21:32:52 INTERPRETATION ABOUT EXACTLY WHICH CATEGORY A PARTICULAR

21:32:58 DEVELOPMENT FALLS INTO.
>> AND I ALSO WANT TO ADD THAT ANOTHER 
21:33:03 REASON WHY WE DON'T HAVE A SEPARATE FEE FOR $50, WE'RE KEEPING IT AT $44 IS 
21:33:08 BECAUSE IT'S MORE COMPARABLE TO WHAT OTHER BAY AREA CITIES ARE  CHARGING.

21:33:13 IF WE'RE CHARGING $50 IT'S MUCH HIGHER THAN WHAT OTHER CITIES ARE CHARGING.

21:33:21 ME
>> Commissioner McDonald:    OKAY, 
21:33:26 THEN THE OTHER THING I WANTED TO ASK WAS, THERE WAS A LINE WHERE IT SAID 
21:33:33 THAT -- I THINK IT WAS YOUR SECOND POINT THAT YOU WERE SAYING THAT

21:33:42 THE HYBRID OPTION 4 IS SUPPOSED TO BE PER SQUARE FOOT BASED ON THE ESTIMATED 
21:33:50 ECONOMIC CONSULTANTS THE $15 PER SQUARE FEET IS APPROXIMATE TO PROVIDING THE 
21:33:53 5%.
ARE WE TRYING TO PUSH THE PEOPLE 
21:33:56 TOWARDS THE INCLUSIONARY OR TOWARDS THE IN LIEU FEES?

21:34:00 BECAUSE SEEMS TO ME IF WE  WERE -- WE REALLY WANT TO ENCOURAGE ONE THING OR 
21:34:05 THE OTHER WE WOULD MAKE THE COST A LITTLE BIT MORE FAVORABLE ON THAT 
21:34:11 SIDE.
WHY DO WE WANT IT TO BE COMPARABLE?

21:34:21 DO WE HAVE AN OUTCOME THAT WE PREFER?


21:34:24 >> Dan Schoenholz:   YES, I THINK WE HEARD THERE IS SOME INTEREST IN 
21:34:27 GENERATING MODERATE INCOME UNITS THROUGH THE ORDINANCE.

21:34:40 I THINK THERE'S A STRONG INTEREST IN GENERATING REVENUES TO SUBSIDIZE 
21:34:42 MULTISYSTEM AFFORDABLE PROJECTS THAT ARE RENTAL.

21:34:47 BUT WE DID HEAR SOME SUPPORT FOR STRUCTURING THE ORDINANCE SO THAT 
21:34:50 THERE MIGHT BE SOME MODERATE INCOME PRODUCTION.

21:34:55 SO WE'RE SORT OF TRYING TO WALK THE LINE WHERE WE THINK WE'LL GET FEES THE 
21:35:01 PRIMARILY BUT IN SOME CASES WE MAY SEE SOME MODERATE INCOME PRODUCTION.

21:35:06 >> Commissioner McDonald:   SO WE DON'T -- WE'RE NOTE PREFER ONE OVER THE 
21:35:10 OTHER OR  ENCOURAGING ONE OVER THE OTHER?

21:35:20 THERE'S NO -- SO ON THE CITY SIDE, WE DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE ONE WE PREFER?

21:35:23 >> Dan Schoenholz:   YEAH, I THINK, YOU KNOW, THE DIRECTION THAT WE GOT FROM 
21:35:27 THE COUNCIL WAS REALLY WE WANT TO RETAIN THE FEE OPTION, WE WANT TO 
21:35:33 CONTINUE TO OFFER MULTIPLE OPTIONS THAT DEVELOPERS CAN

21:35:37 PICK FROM.
AND, YOU KNOW, THERE IS SOME INTEREST 
21:35:41 IN SEEING SOME MODERATE INCOME OWNERSHIP PRODUCTION.

21:35:51 I MEAN, THE DIFFICULTY IS THAT THE MARKET IS CONSTANTLY CHANGING AND WE 
21:35:54 CAN'T CHANGE THE ORDINANCE TO KEEP UP WITH THE CHANGES IN THE MARKETPLACE.

21:35:59 SO WE'RE SORT OF TRYING TO YOU KNOW KIND OF ADDRESS DID VARIOUS INTERESTS 
21:36:07 THAT WE HEARD FROM THE COUNCIL, AND WE WOULD ANTICIPATE THAT MOST DEVELOPERS 
21:36:09 WOULD CONTINUE TO PAY FEES BUT THERE MAY BE

21:36:14 CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE IT MAKES SENSE FOR THEM TO DO THE HYBRID OPTION AND 
21:36:19 PRODUCE, YOU KNOW, SOME MODERATE INCOME OWNERSHIP UNITS.

21:36:23 >> Commissioner McDonald:   AND THEN WITH SOME MONEY THAT WE TAKE IN IN 
21:36:31 LIEU FEES, BECAUSE OWNERSHIP IS SO EXPENSIVE, AND IT IS SO OVARIABLE, AND 
21:36:37  VARIABLE, AND SO FEW PEOPLE ACTUALLY BENEFIT FROM

21:36:41 THAT OPTION, IS THERE ANY WAY WE CAN TAKE ALL THAT MONEY THAT IS GOING INTO 
21:36:45 IN LIEU AND PAY PARTIAL RENT FOR PEOPLE OF THAT INCOME LEVEL YOU KNOW HELP 
21:36:48 THEM WITH RENT SO THAT THEY CAN PERHAPS SAVE

21:36:51 TOWARDS DOWN PAYMENT WHICH SEEMS TO BE THE LARGEST FACTOR KEEPING THEM FROM 
21:36:56 GETTING INTO THESE, YOU KNOW, MODERATE RATE UNITS.

21:37:03 I KNOW RIGHT NOW, DURING COVID WE WERE PAYING RENT, OR  HAVING -- WE HAD -- 
21:37:07 WE WERE ADMINISTERING A RENTAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM.

21:37:11 COULD WE CONTINUE SOMETHING LIKE THAT WITH THE MODERATE INCOME PEOPLE SO 
21:37:19 THAT MORE PEOPLE ARE BENEFITING FROM THE MONEY AND WE'RE IMMEDIATELY 
21:37:22 PROVIDING HOUSING, HELPING TO PROVIDE HOUSING FOR THE

21:37:29 MODERATE INCOME LEVEL RATE PEOPLE?
>> SO UNFORTUNATELY, THE IN LIEU FEES 
21:37:39 THAT WE COLLECTED IS FOR MORE SO 60% A MIMPLET AND SOMETIMES THEY CAN GO UP 
21:37:41 TO 80.
THE REASON IS BECAUSE ALL OF THESE 
21:37:44 RENTAL PROJECTS ARE USING HOUSING FUNDING TO SUPPORT.

21:37:50 THEY ALL NEED TAX CREDIT FUNDING IN ORDER TO COMPETE WELL, ACTUALLY TO 
21:37:56 QUALIFY FOR TAX CREDITS, THEY CANNOT GO BEYOND 80% AMI.

21:38:00 ACTUALLY THEY HAVE TO CONCENTRATE ON SERVING LOWER INCOME HOUSEHOLDS SUCH 
21:38:04 AS 60% AND BELOW.
SO WE CANNOT USE THAT FUNDING SOURCE 
21:38:09 THAT WE COLLECT TO HELP MODERATE INCOME HOUSEHOLDS.

21:38:14 
>> Commissioner McDonald:   EVEN IF WE 
21:38:22 ALLOWED MODERATE RATE IN LIEU FEES?


21:38:28 >> Dan Schoenholz:   JUST TO CLARIFY, CAN IF WE USE THE FEES TO SUBSIDIZE 
21:38:36 THE TAX CREDIT PROJECT WE'RE LIMITED IN WHAT INCOME LEVELS CAN USE IN THAT TAX 
21:38:40 CREDIT PROJECT.
THE THE THE FEES ONLY HAVE TO GO TO 
21:38:43 SUPPORT AFFORDABLE HOUSING.
SO THE COUNCIL COULD SAY WE WANT TO 
21:38:49 TAKE ALL THOSE FEES AND USE IT TO SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF MODERATE 
21:38:52 INCOME OWNERSHIP UNITS.
THEY HAVE NOT DONE THAT IN THE PAST, 
21:38:56 THEY HAVE NOT WANTED TO DO THAT.
THEY REALLY SVELTE THAT THE MOST BANK 
21:39:02 FOR THE BUCK WAS USING THE MONEY FOR MULTIFAMILY RENTAL PROJECTS THAT 
21:39:05 LEVERAGE OUTSIDE DOLLARS IN AND THOSE FAMILIES ARE THE ONES THAT ARE THE 
21:39:10 MOST AT RISK OF
DISPLACEMENT AND EVEN HOMELESSNESS IF 
21:39:12 THEY DON'T HAVE AFFORDABLE PLACES TO LIVE.

21:39:18 SO THAT'S WHERE THE COUNCIL HAS FOCUSED THE USE OF THE FUNDS.

21:39:22 >> Commissioner McDonald:   ALL OF THE FUNDS AND SO ALL OF THESE IN LIEU 
21:39:26 FEES, SO WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS ALL OF THE IN LIEU FEES ARE EARMARKED FOR 
21:39:38 VERY LOW AND LOW INCOME BUT THAT THE
MODERATE RATE HOUSING FOR RIGHT NOW IS 
21:39:47 ONLY THE THE  INCLUSIONARY?
THAT DEVELOPERS CANNOT PAY IN LIEU FOR 
21:39:51 THE MODERATE RATE UNITS IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO TELL ME?

21:39:54 >> Dan Schoenholz:   THAT'S PRIMARILY MODERATE INCOME HOUSING IS THROUGH 
21:40:05 INCLUSIONARY UNITS, YOU KNOW, OCCASIONALLY NOT IN THE BAY AREA 
21:40:09 ANYMORE BUT IN OTHER CASES OCCASIONALLY THE MARKET RATE CAN

21:40:12 PRODUCE IT.
ACCESSORY DWELLING UNITS ARE MORE 
21:40:16 AFFORDABLE AND THERE'S ACTUALLY A STUDY GOING ON AT THE STATE LEVEL THAT WE 
21:40:23 MIGHT BE ABLE TO USE TO JUSTIFY COUNTING SOME PERCENTAGE OF ACCESSORY 
21:40:26 DWELLING UNITS THAT
ARE BUILT IN FREMONT AS MODERATE 
21:40:29 INCOME  UNITS.
SO THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE'RE 
21:40:36 LOOKING AT.
WE DID HAVE ONE PROJECT, HABITAT FOR 
21:40:43 HUMANITY PROJECT, CENTRAL COMMONS, WHERE 19, I BELIEVE IT WAS 19 MODERATE 
21:40:52 INCOME UNITS WERE PRODUCED.
AND THAT WAS USING IN LIEU FEES PAID 
21:40:57 BY A MARKET RATE DEVELOPER AND THEN ALSO SOME STATE GRANT MONEY THAT WAS 
21:41:02 AVAILABLE FOR OWNERSHIP.
THERE AREN'T OFTEN STATE GRANT DOLLARS 
21:41:05 FOR OWNERSHIP PROJECTS.
BUT THERE WAS ONE OPPORTUNITY A FEW 
21:41:09 YEARS AGO AND THAT HELPED FUND CENTRAL COMMONS.

21:41:15 SO SORT OF DIFFERENT POSSIBILITIES, BUT GENERALLY, THE INCLUSIONARY UNITS ARE 
21:41:20 THE MAIN WAY TO GET MODERATE INCOME PRODUCTION.

21:41:26 >> SO THERE WERE ACTUALLY 30  DAN.
DID 19 IS PHASE 2, IF WE COMBINE DPAIZ 
21:41:32 1 AND 2 THERE ARE ACTUALLY 30 MODERATE INCOME UNITS PRODUCED BY HABITAT.

21:41:36 
>> Commissioner McDonald:   THEY'RE 
21:41:39 ALL COMPLETED ALL 30?
>> CORRECT.

21:41:43 >> Commissioner McDonald:   I GUESS TO BOIL IT DOWN THE EXTRA PIECE I'M 
21:41:48 THROWING IN THERE IS, IN CASES WHERE, YOU KNOW, WE'RE NOT GETTING THOSE 
21:41:53 INCLUSIONARY UNITS, RIGHT, AND I'M JUST  LOOKING AT

21:42:00 THE NUMBER OF FAMILIES WE HAVE THAT ARE IN THE MODERATE RATE BRACKET.

21:42:05 AND HOW MANY FAMILIES WE ACTUALLY HELP WITH THOSE INCLUSIONARY RATE UNITS.

21:42:12 EVEN WITH THE COMPLETED  PROJECTS, WE HAVE 30 INCLUDED MODERATE RATE HOMES 
21:42:17 WHERE WE'VE HELPED 30 FAMILIES.
MY SUGGESTION AND MY HOPE IS THAT IF 
21:42:23 WE OFFERED RENTAL ASSISTANCE WITH THAT MONEY RATHER THAN, YOU KNOW, HOUSING, 
21:42:28 MODERATE RATE ACTUAL HOMES TO PURCHASE, THAT WE COULD HELP MORE PEOPLE, MORE

21:42:35 IMMEDIATELY, THAN SAVING UP OR WAITING FOR THESE, YOU KNOW, MODERATELY -- 
21:42:41 HOMES TO BE BUILT AND SOLD.
AND TO HAVE BUYERS WHO COULD SAVE 
21:42:43 ENOUGH DOWN PAYMENT TO ACTUALLY GET INTO THOSE UNITS.

21:42:48 SO I MEAN IT JUST SEEMS LIKE THAT WE HAVE SO MANY PEOPLE HAVING TROUBLE 
21:42:52 PAYING THEIR  RENT.
YOU KNOW, OR GETTING KICKED OUT OF 
21:42:58 THEIR HOMES BECAUSE THEY CAN'T AFFORD THE THE INCREASES IN RENT, OR CAN'T 
21:43:02 SAVE FOR THEIR DOWN PAYMENT BECAUSE THEY'RE PAYING ALL THEIR INCOME IN 
21:43:08 RENT.
AND WE COULD HELP THEM BEFORE  OR, YOU 
21:43:16 KNOW, BEFORE IT BECOMES A PROBLEM.
>> Dan Schoenholz:   IT'S A 
21:43:17 CHALLENGE.
THERE AREN'T -- THERE'S NOT ENOUGH 
21:43:21 RESOURCES TO GO AROUND TO HELP EVERYBODY WHO COULD USE HELP WITH 
21:43:26 THEIR HOUSING COST FOR SURE.
SO IT'S KIND OF A QUESTION OF WHERE DO 
21:43:30 YOU DEVOTE THE LIMITED RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE.

21:43:34 >> Commissioner McDonald:   YES.
>> Commissioner Yee:   COMMISSIONER 
21:43:39 McDONALD, THIS IS CHAIR YEE.
I THINK WE'RE GETTING TO THE POINT 
21:43:41 WHERE IT'S ALMOST LIKE COMMISSION DELIBERATION.

21:43:47 I WANT TO MAKE SURE WE FOLLOW, ITS CLARIFYING QUESTIONS AND I SEIZE THAT 
21:43:51 COMMISSIONER DAULTON HAS HIS HAND UP AS WELL AND WE STILL HAVE TO GO TO PUBLIC 
21:43:56 COMMENTS.
SO IF I COULD ASK YOU TO MAYBE HOLD 
21:44:00 OFF WITH THE ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS, WHEN WE GET TO THE DELIBERATION, I WANT TO 
21:44:03 BE ABLE TO GIVE OTHER PEOPLE OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO HAVE 
21:44:12 CLARIFYING QUESTIONS.
I THINK COMMISSIONER McDONALD AT LEAST 
21:44:17 ON MY SCREEN YOU'RE FROZEN, I SEE YOU'RE ALREADY MUTED.

21:44:21 COMMISSIONER DAULTON, CAN YOU ASK YOUR CLARIFYING QUESTIONS IS SINCE YOU HAVE 
21:44:24 YOUR HANDS  RAISED?
>> Commissioner Daulton:   OKAY, THANK 
21:44:31 YOU CHAIR.
SO WHAT IS THE -- WHAT IS THE RANGE OF 
21:44:39 HOME COST WE CONSIDER MODERATE IN FREMONT?

21:44:42 >> SO YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE PRICES?
>> Commissioner Daulton:    PRICES.

21:44:45 >> HOW MUCH IT SOLD FOR MODERATE INCOME?

21:44:51 >> Commissioner Daulton:   YES, WHEN WE TELL A DEVELOPER, INCLUDE 5% MODERATE 
21:44:55 INCOME, WHAT DOES HE SELL THOSE FOR AS A RANGE?

21:45:02 >> YEAH, AS A RANGE ABOUT AVERAGE IS ABOUT $500,000, RESTRICTED PRICE.

21:45:14 IT DEPENDS ON BEDROOM SIZE OF COURSE.
SO A TWO BEDROOM IS JUST UNDER 500 AND 
21:45:19 A THREE BEDROOM IS JUST OVER 500.
I WOULD SAY 500,000.

21:45:25 >> Commissioner Daulton:   SO THE INCOME RANGE ON THAT IS UP DO 120% OF 
21:45:27 AMI IS THAT RIGHT?
>> CORRECT.

21:45:31 >> Commissioner Daulton:   AND THE BOTTOM RANGE IS ABOVE 80% OF AMI IS 
21:45:35 THAT RIGHT?
>> 80 TO 120 THAT'S CORRECT.

21:45:42 >> Commissioner Daulton:   80 TO 120.
SO WHAT IS THE -- WHAT IS THE MONTHLY 
21:45:45 MORTGAGE PAYMENT GOING TO BE ON A $500,000 HOME?

21:45:53 >> IT REALLY IT DEPENDS ON WHAT INCOME LEVEL THE HOUSEHOLD IN, SO SOMETIMES 
21:45:58 THE HOW HOLD AT 80% MAY QUALIFY BECAUSE THAT HOUSEHOLD HAS A LARGE DOWN 
21:46:01 PAYMENT OR SOMETHING.
SO IT REALLY DEPENDS ON SEVERAL 
21:46:05 FACTORS.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   WAIT, IF 
21:46:09 WE'RE DOING SUBSIDIZED HOUSING DO YOU EXPECT PEOPLE DO HAVE A LARGE DOWN 
21:46:13 PAYMENT?
>> NO, ABOUT 3 TO 3.5%.

21:46:15 >> Commissioner Daulton:   RIGHT.
>> I THINK I CAN ANSWER YOUR 
21:46:17 QUESTION.
WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE 
21:46:24 HOUSEHOLD WILL NOT PAY MORE THAN 35% OF THEIR INCOME TOWARDS HOUSING COST.

21:46:37 >> Commissioner Daulton:   YES, AND SO.

21:46:43 >> I CAN DROP IN HERE.
3500 A MONTH FOR MORTGAGE PAYMENT.

21:46:47 >> Commissioner Daulton:   TO 500,000 HOUSE $2300?

21:46:52 >> A ROUGH NUMBER WE SEE IN RESALES.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   OKAY AND SO 
21:47:10 HOW MANY OF THESE  $500,000 HOUSES HAVE WE BUILT SINCE 2015?

21:47:17 >> ROUGH NUMBER.
FROM HAB HAT FOR HUMANITY, AFFORDABLE, 
21:47:20 ABOUT 23, 23 THAT WE BUILT.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   SO DO YOU 
21:47:25 HONESTLY THINK THAT THIS, THE CHANGE WE'RE LOOKING AT TODAY IS GOING TO 
21:47:28 CHANGE THAT?
ARE WE GOING TO GET MORE MODERATE 
21:47:36 UNITS OUT OF THIS CHANGE?
>> IT REALLY DEPENDS ON THE MARKET 
21:47:39 CONDITIONS.
I THINK DAN WANTS TO JUMP IN, GO 
21:47:40 AHEAD.
>> Dan Schoenholz:   I WAS GOING TO 
21:47:46 CHIME IN THE DEVELOPER'S CONDITION IS WHAT IS GOING TO BE CHEAPER FOR ME TO 
21:47:49 FULFILL RIGHT?
WE ARE RAISING THE FEES CONSIDERABLY 
21:47:57 WHICH PUSHES THEM TOWARDS, YOU KNOW, INCLUSIONARY UNITS BECAUSE IT'S 
21:47:59 BECOMING MORE EXPENSIVE TO PAY THE FEES.

21:48:03 BUT AT THE SAME TIME, THE SPREAD BETWEEN WHAT THEY CAN SELL A UNIT FOR 
21:48:07 ON THE MARKET, OPEN MARKET VERSUS MODERATE INCOME UNIT THAT'S ALSO 
21:48:15 GROWING AND IT CHANGES ALL THE TIME.
SO IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR US TO SAY 
21:48:21 WITH ANY KIND OF CONFIDENCE THAT WE'LL GET, YOU KNOW, X NUMBER OF, YOU KNOW, 
21:48:24 INCLUSIONARY UNITS.
WE'RE TAKING OUR BEST SHOT AT TRYING 
21:48:32 TO CREATE A STRUCTURE THAT WILL PRODUCE FEES AND HOPEFULLY PRODUCE SOME 
21:48:34 UNITS.
AND, YOU KNOW, WE WOULD EXPECT THE 
21:48:38 DECISIONS THAT DEVELOPERS TO MAKE THE CHANGE AS THE MARKET CONDITIONS 
21:48:39 CHANGE.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   AND WHAT'S 
21:48:45 THE DOWN SIDE TO A  STRICTLY INCLUSIONARY REQUIREMENT ON MODERATE 
21:48:50 INCOME HOUSING?
>> YEAH, I MEAN THAT'S WHAT WE HAD 
21:48:54 STARTING IN 2002 RIGHT?
WHAT WE GOT IS WE GOT A LOT OF 
21:49:01 MODERATE INCOME OWNERSHIP UNITS AND SO THAT FILLED THAT NEED BETTER THAN 
21:49:05 WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO SINCE THEN.
BECAUSE THE DECISION REALLY STARTING 
21:49:11 IN 2010 WAS WE REALLY NEED TO TRY TO GENERATED MORE RESOURCES TO AIM AT 
21:49:16 PEOPLE WHO ARE BELOW MODERATE INCOME WHO ARE HAVING DIFFICULTIES AFFORDING 
21:49:17 HOUSING.
SO THAT'S REALLY BEEN THE DIRECTION 
21:49:25 THAT THE CITY COUNCIL HAS BEEN GOING IN THE LAST TEN YEARS OR SO.

21:49:33 IN 2015 AS I THINK I MENTIONED, WE TRIED TO SETTLE UP THE ORDINANCE SO 
21:49:37 THERE WOULD BE MODERATE HOUSING PRODUCTION.

21:49:42 HOUSES WERE GOING UP SO QUICKLY THAT DEVELOPERS QUICKLY REALIZED IT COST US 
21:49:48 MORE TO PRODUCE A A MODERATE INCOME UNIT BECAUSE THE GAP WHAT WE CAN SELL 
21:49:51 AFFORDABLE LEVEL TO MARKET LEVEL IS VERY BIG, IT'S

21:49:55 GROWING AND WE'LL PAY THE FEE, THAT'S PREFERABLE TO  US, THAT'S PERSISTED.

21:50:00 BUT WITH THE INCREASE IN FEES THAT SORT OF BALANCES THE SCALES AGAIN FOR NOW.

21:50:06 BUT YOU KNOW, IT WILL CONTINUE TO EVOLVE AND CAN'T PREDICT EXACTLY HOW 
21:50:08 IT WILL PLAY OUT.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   AND SO THE 
21:50:13 INCREASE IN THESE MODERATE FEES FUNNELS MONEY TOWARDS LOWER INCOME HOUSING IS 
21:50:21 THAT CORRECT?
WE'RE USING THOSE FEES TO BUILD 
21:50:28 MODERATE INCOME, WE'RE USING THOSE FEES TO PRODUCE LOW INCOME HOUSING.

21:50:31 >> WE'RE INCREASING FEES ON MARKET RATE HOUSING.

21:50:35 THIS IS HOUSING THAT IS NOT CAN LOW TO MODERATE INCOME.

21:50:40 IN THE BAY AREA IT IS PEOPLE THAT ARE PROBABLY 150 TO 175% INCOME.

21:51:00 AND SO THE FEES ARE ON THOSE HOMES.
AND WE USE THOSE TO SUBSIDIZE RENTAL, 
21:51:06 THE ONES I MENTIONED IN EARLIER IN THE PRESENTATION, WE CREATED 850 UNITS AND 
21:51:11 SO ON IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS AND THAT WAS USING THE FEES PRIMARILY YOU 
21:51:13 CHARGED TO
MARKET RATE DEVELOPMENT.

21:51:17 >> Commissioner Daulton:   WE'RE NOT GETTING ANY REAL MOTION ON MARKET RATE 
21:51:22 HOUSING AT ALL?
>> VERY LITTLE RIGHT NOW YEAH.

21:51:25 >> Commissioner Daulton:   AS FAR AS WHAT I CAN TELL WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING 
21:51:29 RIGHT HERE ISN'T REALLY GOING DO CHANGE THAT, IS IT?

21:51:35 SHELZ AGAIN, WHAT WE'RE FROAPG IS INCREASING THE FEES, THE IN LIEU FEES 
21:51:43 SIGNIFICANTLY SO  THAT -- THAT TENDS TO CUT TO, YOU KNOW, PUSHING DEVELOPERS 
21:51:50 TO MORE FOOKS.
BUT WHETHER THEY WILL OR NOT WILL 
21:51:54 REALLY DEPEND ON A COST CALCULATION GOING THROUGH.

21:51:59 VLT THAT GOING TO PUSH THEM TO MORE PROD MODERATE HOUSING, THEY WANT TO 
21:52:03 BUILD A $500,000 HOUSE ON A $500,000 PIECE OF LAND, RIGHT?

21:52:09 I MEAN, IT SAID IN THE REPORT THAT THE AVERAGE COST OF A SINGLE FAMILY 
21:52:14 RESIDENTIAL WAS  $450,000 PIECE OF LAND.

21:52:18 >> Dan Schoenholz:   YES, BUT I MEAN IF YOU CRUNCH THE NUMBERS, IF YOU LOOK AT 
21:52:26 SOMEBODY BUILDING TEN HOMES, LET'S SAY THEY'RE  2500 SQUARE FEET, THAT'S 
21:52:29 25,000 SQUARE FEET, THEY HAVE TO PAY WHATEVER,

21:52:32 WE'RE SAYING $44.
WE HAVE TO PAY A $44 ON EVERY SINGLE 
21:52:35 SQUARE FOOT THAT'S A BIG NUMBER.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   YES.

21:52:41 
>> Dan Schoenholz:   THE QUESTION IS, 
21:52:46 IS THAT A LARGER FEE OR LESSER FEE ON A MODERATE UNIT?

21:52:51 BACK OF THE ENVELOPE I WAS  LOOKING AT THIS THE OTHER DAY GIVEN MY LIMITED 
21:52:55 KNOWLEDGE IT SEEMED LIKE IT WOULD BE PRETTY COMPARABLE RIGHT NOW.

21:52:58 >> Commissioner Daulton:   YES.
>> Dan Schoenholz:   BUT YOU KNOW, IT 
21:53:05 CHANGES ALL THE TIME.
AND I THINK, YOU KNOW --

21:53:09 >> Commissioner Daulton:   IF HOUSING PRICES CONTINUE TO GO UP THAT'S NOT 
21:53:15 GOING TO WORK IN OUR FAVOR IN THIS REGARD, IS IT?

21:53:17 >> Dan Schoenholz:   YES.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   THANK YOU.

21:53:19 >> Commissioner Yee:   THANK  YOU, JOEL YOU THERE?

21:53:34 >> Planner Pullen:   I AM.
>> Commissioner Yee:   WE'RE ALMOST 
21:53:37 APPROACHING 10, RIGHT?
>> Planner Pullen:   10 WOULD BE 
21:53:39 GREAT.
>> Commissioner Yee:   ACTUALLY WOULD 
21:53:42 I LIKE TO GO A LITTLE BIT EARLIER, IF POSSIBLE.

21:53:48 LET'S COME IMPACT AGAIN IN ABOUT TEN MINUTES, THAT WOULD MAKE IT 10:03, IF 
21:53:51 THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMISSION WE'LL TRY GO OTHE PUBLIC 
21:53:58  COMMENT.
I GUESS IT WILL BE 10:04.

22:05:47 LET'S COME BACK AT 10:04.
[ RECESS ]

22:05:53 >> JUST SO EVERYBODY KNOWS, SOME OF US HERE AT THE CITY OFFICES ARE HAVING 
22:05:58 PROBLEMS WITH I.T. CONNECTION.
IT'S BEEN KICKING US OUT.

22:06:03 AND SO MINE JUST GOT BACK IN.
CAN.

22:06:09 
>> CAN YOU HEAR ME?

22:06:13 >> YES, I CAN HEAR YOU LUCIA.
>> I JUST CALLED BACK IN.

22:06:18 >> Commissioner Yee:   I THINK WE'RE STILL WAITING FOR COMMISSIONER 
22:06:21 CARDENAS.
>> Commissioner Cardenas:   NO I'M 
22:06:24 BACK.
I KNOW BETTER, I KNOW BETTER, CHAIR.

22:06:27 >> Commissioner Yee:   THANKS, OKAY.
SO WE HAVE EVERYBODY BACK, RIGHT?

22:06:33 >> YES, TRISH IS HAVING  PROBLEMS.
SO -- YEAH SO WE'RE WAITING FOR 
22:06:36 TRISH?
>> NO, NO, WE CAN GO AHEAD, I CAN 
22:06:37 MONITOR THE MEETING.
CAN I HELP.

22:06:44 YEAH OKAY, WELL THANK YOU FOR EVERYBODY INDULGING ON A BREAK FOR ME.

22:06:47 SO I GUESS WE'RE GOING TO PICK UP WHERE WE LEFT OFF.

22:06:52 IF ANY OTHER COMMISSIONERS MAY HAVE ANY OTHER CLARIFYING QUESTIONS OF THE 
22:06:55 PRESENTATION THAT WAS JUST PRESENTED TO US?

22:06:58 IF NOT THEN I'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO GO TO PUBLIC COMMENTS.

22:07:01 AND THE PEOPLE THAT ARE WAITING.
IF THERE ARE PEOPLE WAITING.

22:07:11 >> Commissioner McDonald:   COULD I HAVE A QUESTION PLEASE BEFORE WE?

22:07:12 >> Commissioner Yee:   COMMISSIONER McDONALD.

22:07:15 >> Commissioner McDonald:   IT'S SO VERY BASIC I FEEL LIKE I'M THE ONLY 
22:07:17 PERSON WHO DOESN'T QUITE UNDERSTAND IT.

22:07:25 SO WHEN WE SAY THAT IT IS INCLUSIONARY, THEY ACTUALLY BUILD 15%, RIGHT?

22:07:29 I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY.
THAT WHEN -- SO WHAT WE'RE ASKING THEM 
22:07:45 TO DO IS EITHER BUILD 15% INCLUSIONARY, OR  PAY -- IT'S THAT 5% PLUS THE $20 
22:07:52 THAT I DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND.
DAN CAN YOU CLARIFY THAT FOR ME?

22:07:56 >> Dan Schoenholz:   SO THE OPTIONS --
>> Commissioner McDonald:   THE HYBRID 
22:07:57 MODELS.
>> Dan Schoenholz:   THERE ARE MANY 
22:08:01 OPTIONS IN THE ORDINANCE.
ONE OF THEM IS TO PAY AN IN LIEU FEE 
22:08:05 WHICH WOULD BE SET AT, YOU KNOW, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT $44 THAT'S THE STAFF 
22:08:12 RECOMMENDATION FOR OWNERSHIP.
THEY COULD ALSO PROVIDE 15% 
22:08:19 INCLUSIONARY.
5% OF THAT WOULD BE MODERATE INCOME 
22:08:23 AND 10% LOW INCOME.
SO THAT'S ANOTHER OPTION.

22:08:29 THERE'S ALSO THAT WHAT WE CALLED THE HYBRID OPTION, WHERE THEY COULD 
22:08:35 PROVIDE 5% MODERATE INCOME INCLUSIONARY, AND PAY A REDUCED FEE.

22:08:41 AND THE FEE WOULD BE $17 LESS THAN THE $44 WE'RE RECOMMENDING OR $29.

22:08:44 SO THOSE ARE THREE OF THE  OPTIONS IN THE ORDINANCE.

22:08:51 AND THOSE ARE THE ONES THAT INVOLVE THAT IN LIEU FEE PAYMENT OR 100% 
22:08:55 INCLUSIONARY.
>> Commissioner McDonald:   SO IN THIS 
22:09:02 CURRENT MODEL WE ACTUALLY HAVE PEOPLE WHO CAN STILL PAY THE IN LIEU FEE FOR 
22:09:09 MODERATE HOUSING WITHOUT ACTUALLY BUILDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING?

22:09:16 >> Dan Schoenholz:   CORRECT?, YES, THEY CAN PAY AN IN LIEU FEE TO MEET 
22:09:19 THEIR ENTIRE OBLIGATION UNDER THE ORDINANCE, CORRECT.

22:09:23 >> Commissioner Yee:   ALL RIGHT.
WITH THAT, IF THERE AREN'T ANY OTHER 
22:09:27 CAN CLARIFYING QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMISSION I'D LIKE TO OPEN IT UP TO 
22:09:30 PUBLIC COMMENTS.
SO WE'RE GOING TO TAKE PUBLIC 
22:09:32 COMMENTS.
SO TRISH ARE THERE ANY RAISED HANDS 
22:09:38 FOR THIS AGENDA ITEM FROM THE PUBLIC?
>> I -- CHAIR YEE I'M TAKING A LOOK 
22:09:43 NOW AND I DO NOT SEE ANY RAISED HANDS.
SO WE DO NOT HAVE ANY SPEAKERS.

22:09:50 >> Commissioner Yee:   OKAY.
SO WITH THAT, THEN, I WILL THEN CLOSE 
22:09:55 THE PUBLIC HEARING FOR THIS ITEM AND THEN GO BACK TO OUR Q&A FOR THE 
22:09:57 COMMISSION.
AND SEE IF THE COMMISSION HAS ANY 
22:10:04 OTHER QUESTIONS FOR STAFF.
OKAY.

22:10:07 ANY COMMISSIONERS?
GOING ONCE, GOING TWICE.

22:10:12 THIRD TIME.
I GUESS IT WOULD BE ME.

22:10:16 I GUESS DAN, MY QUESTION IS TO YOU, IS THAT WITH THIS CHANGES TO THE 
22:10:25 ORDINANCE, DOES THIS HELP SIMPLIFY THE PROCESS FOR DEVELOPERS?

22:10:29 >> Dan Schoenholz:   YEAH, IT DOES.
I THINK, YOU KNOW, HAVING FEWER 
22:10:37 CATEGORIES IS MUCH CLEANER.
I THINK THE INCLUSIONARY PART WHERE 
22:10:42 THEY HAD BEFORE THEY HAD TO PROVIDE INCLUSIONARY UNITS AT FOUR DIFFERENT 
22:10:45 INCOME LEVELS AND THEY WERE IN FRACTIONAL PERCENTAGES AND THAT SORT 
22:10:48 OF THING.
WE DID THAT AT THE TIME BECAUSE WE 
22:10:53 WERE GOING DIRECTLY FROM THE NEXUS STUDY AND WE WERE TRYING TO AVOID 
22:10:58 LEGAL LIABILITY.
SO WE DID EXACTLY WHAT THE NEXUS STUDY 
22:11:00 SAID.
NOW WE HAVE A LITTLE MORE FREEDOM TO 
22:11:08 JUST BE -- TO JUST ROUND NUMBERS, AND, YOU KNOW, KIND OF ALIGN OUR 
22:11:10 PERCENTAGES WITH WHAT OTHER COMMUNITIES ARE DOING.

22:11:16 SO I DO THINK THAT THIS VERSION THAT WE'RE -- YOU KNOW THE REVISIONS THAT 
22:11:22 WE'RE PROPOSING DEFINITELY WILL MAKE IT EASIER TO UNDERSTAND AND, YOU KNOW, 
22:11:24 JUST SORT OF COMPARABLE TO OTHER JURISDICTIONS.

22:11:30 >> Commissioner Yee:   OKAY AND I GUESS THE OTHER THING TOO, DOES THIS HELP 
22:11:34 PROVIDE THEM MORE FLEXIBILITY TO BE ABLE TO MEET ALL THESE DIFFERENT -- 
22:11:38 YOU KNOW BASICALLY IT'S THE TWO CATEGORIES.

22:11:43 SO WOULD THIS BE SOMETHING  EASIER FOR THEM IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO 
22:11:49 ACTUALLY DO VERSUS WHAT WE CURRENT HAVE BEFORE THESE PROPOSED CHANGES?

22:11:50 >> Dan Schoenholz:   WELL YOU KNOW IT'S INTERESTING.

22:11:55 BECAUSE I THINK WHEN STAFF BROUGHT THIS TO THE COUNCIL IN THE STUDY SESSION WE 
22:11:58 WERE INTERESTED IN REDUCING THE FLEXIBILITY.

22:12:04 BECAUSE IT MAKES IT ALL THE DIFFERENT OPTIONS DO MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO 
22:12:07 OADMINISTER, THERE ARE SO MANY DIFFERENT POSSIBILITIES FOR 
22:12:09 DEVELOPERS.
THE COUNCIL WAS PRETTY CLEAR THAT THEY 
22:12:13 WANTED TO RETAIN THE FLEXIBILITY THAT IS IN THE CURRENT ORDINANCE.

22:12:18 SO I DON'T THINK WE'RE EXPANDING IT.
BUT I THINK IT'S JUST AS FLEXIBLE AS 
22:12:21 THE CURRENT ORDINANCE.
WE BASICALLY ARE WORKING WITH ALL THE 
22:12:24 SAME OPTIONS.
WE'RE JUST TRYING TO MAKE THEM A 
22:12:27 LITTLE EASIER TO ADMINISTER AND A LITTLE EASIER TO UNDERSTAND.

22:12:31 >> Commissioner Yee:   OKAY THANKS DAN, THOSE ARE BASICALLY MY TWO QUESTIONS.

22:12:36 ANYBODY ELSE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS?
COMMISSIONER DAULTON.

22:12:41 I SEE YOUR HAND RAISED.
THERE YOU GO.

22:12:44 >> Commissioner Daulton:   I DON'T HAVE A QUESTION BUT IF NO ONE ELSE DOES I'D 
22:12:49 LIKE TO MAKE A MOTION.
I'D LIKE TO MOVE THAT WE RECOMMEND 
22:12:54 CITY COUNCIL INTRODUCE THIS ORDINANCE.
APPROVING THIS TEXT AMENDMENT.

22:13:01 WITH THE ADDITION THAT WE ASKED COUNCIL TO CONSIDER PUSHING THE FOR-SALE FEES 
22:13:11 UP TO THE FULL  $50.
>> Commissioner Yee:   DO I HEAR A 
22:13:18 SECOND?
>> Commissioner Cardenas:   I SECOND.

22:13:24 >> Commissioner Yee:   I GOT A SECOND FROM $COMMISSIONER CARDENAS.

22:13:29 SO JOEL.
>> Planner Pullen:   I DID WANT TO 
22:13:37 CLARIFY I DID HEAR THE QUESTION ABOUT COMMISSIONER McDONALD ABOUT $50 WITH 
22:13:41 TOIRN HOUSES AND WITH RESPECT TO SINGLE FAMILY.

22:13:49 ARE YOU SAYING THE NEXUS STUDY, I SHOULD ASK THE MAKER OF THE MOTION, SO 
22:13:53 DAULTON ARE YOU SAYING UP TO $50 FOR THE TOWN HOUSE AS THE RECOMMENDATION 
22:13:58 ONLY OR ONLY THE SINGLE FAMILY HOME?
>> Commissioner Daulton:   NO I'M 
22:14:04 LOOKING FOR ALL FOR SALE UNITS EXCEPT STACKED FLATS.

22:14:07 >> Planner Pullen:   SO YOUR RECOMMENDATION IS 50 EXCEPT FOR 
22:14:11 STACKED FLATS.
I'M READY TO CAPTURE THE VOTE IF THERE

22:16:06 COMMISSIONER CARDENAS YOU SAID YOU WANTED TO SHARE SOMETHING?

22:16:08 >> Commissioner Cardenas:   YES I DID REALLY QUICKLY.

22:16:12 JUST A LITTLE DOING WELL BY DOING GOOD OUT HERE WITH FIVE DAYS TO SEPTEMBER 
22:16:16 AND SINCE WE'RE NOT MEETING AT THE BEGINNING OF SEPTEMBER, I JUST WANTED 
22:16:20 TO SHARE A WONDERFUL ORGANIZATION THAT'S GOING TO

22:16:25 BE LAUNCHING HERE IN SEPTEMBER.
IT'S THE LOCAL YOUNG BOY FOUR YEARS 
22:16:30 OLD, JAMMER STRONG FOUNDATION, PEDIATRIC CANCER AWARENESS.

22:16:34 AND I JUST WANTED TO READ A LITTLE PIECE ON HIS BEHALF SO GIVE ME 30 
22:16:37 SECONDS AND I PROMISE I'LL GET THROUGH THIS REALLY QUICK.

22:16:43 AT THE START OF THE GLOBAL COVID-19 PANDEMIC IN 2020, THE EVERYSON FAMILY 
22:16:52 FACED EVERY PARENT'S WORST NIGHTMARE, THE YOUNGEST WAS DIAGNOSED WITH A VERY 
22:17:01 RARE FORM OF CANCER.
JAMISON WAS DIAGNOSED WITH DLG AND T 
22:17:08 ON APRIL 22nd, 2020.
JAMISON AK JAMMERS HAS BEEN BATTLING 
22:17:14 THIS RARE FORM OF CANCER WITH MINIMAL RESEARCH FOR KIDS DIAGNOSED WITH DLG 
22:17:21 AND T.
THIS WILL REQUIRE MORE MONEY TO DRIVE 
22:17:26 REAL KIDS FIGHTING CANCER.
THEY ARE MOTIVATED AND PASSIONATE TO 
22:17:34 CONTINUE THE FIGHTING FOR PEDIATRIC CANCER RESEARCH.

22:17:38 TO CREATE AWARENESS, EDUCATE AND FIGHT FOR A CURE FOR EVERY CHILD WITH 
22:17:40 CANCER.
I THOUGHT THAT WAS A WONDERFUL WAY TO 
22:17:45 KICK OFF PEDIATRIC CANCER AWARENESS MONTH IN SEPTEMBER AND IT'S JUST A 
22:17:49 REAL POSITIVE MESSAGE FROM A REALLY WONDERFUL FAMILY THAT'S DEALING WITH 
22:17:53 SOME REALLY -- A
REALLY TERRIBLE DISEASE AND THEY'RE 
22:17:58 DOING THEIR BEST TO HELP OTHERS BY SHARING THEIR STORIES.
