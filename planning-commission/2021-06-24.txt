19:53:21 , THEY HAVE A LYFT
19:53:21  PROGRAM SO THAT EMPLOYEES THAT DO TAKE
19:53:22  THEIR BICYCLES OR WHATEVER LATE AT NIGHT ON A SHIFT
19:53:25 ,
THEY ACTUALLY PAY FOR THEM TO TAKE THE LYFT
19:53:28  HOME.
HOWEVER, THEY
19:53:32  ALSO PROVIDE TO
19:53:35  THEIR ASSOCIATES, WITHOUT THE TRANSPORTATION
19:53:39  MANAGEMENT PLAN, OR THE $
19:53:42 20, THEY TAKE FOR BUS FARES
19:53:46  PAY FOR BUS FARE
19:53:49 S, SUBWAYS, OFFICERIES AND
19:53:52  FERRIES
19:53:56 , CARPOOL FEES,
 MONTHLY PARKING LOT FEES, WHEN YOU
19:53:59  ARE IN THE ACTUAL SAN FRANCISCO OR
19:54:03 , YOU KNOW, SEATTLE, YOU KNOW, YOU GOT TO PAY FOR PARKING
19:54:06 .
THEY ACTUALLY PROVIDE THAT FOR THEM.

19:54:10 THEY ALSO HAVE INCENTIVES
19:54:13 , OTHER INCENTIVES YOU KNOW WHAT THEY DON'T PAY
19:54:16  FOR TAXIS, BRIDGE
19:54:19  TOLLS, AND OTHER COST
19:54:24 , AND ASSOCIATED
19:54:28  WITH PROBABLY MORE OF A TAXABLE ITEM
19:54:32 .
REGARDING
19:54:37  THE VMT, OBVIOUSLY WE WENT THROUGH PROCESS AND
19:54:40  THOSE NUMBERS CAME UP, ONE THING THAT I'LL
19:54:43  JUST LEAVE YOU WITH, BECAUSE
19:54:47  I HAVEN'T TOUCHED THE SUBJECT IN PROBABLY CLOSE
19:54:50  TO 18 MONTHS OR MORE
19:54:54 ,
HOWEVER,
19:55:02  REGARDING A DRIVE THROUGH AND GREENHOUSE GASES
19:55:05  AS COMMISSIONER McDONALD WAS TALKING ABOUT, A DRIVE-
19:55:09 THROUGH PRODUCES LESS
19:55:12  EMISSIONS THAN SOMEBODY COMING, TURNING THEIR
19:55:15  CAR OFF, GOING
IN AND GETTING COFFEE,
19:55:18  AND THEN COMING BACK OUT AND STARTING THEIR CAR
19:55:23 .
AND HOW THAT, HOW COULD THAT
19:55:26  BE?
WELL, IT'S RELATED TO THE CATALYTIC
19:55:30  CONVERTER.
IF IT
19:55:34  COOLS
19:55:37  DOWN THAT MUCH, JUST THE RESTART OF THE CAR PRODUCES MORE
19:55:40  EMISSIONS THAN GOING THROUGH A DRIVE THROUGH WHEN THE
19:55:43  HEAT IS STILL FUNCTIONING.
IT'S KIND OF LIKE
19:55:47  A DIESEL YOU KNOW LIKE NOW THEY
19:55:51  USE DIF
19:55:54 F FOR DIESEL BUT ANOTHER WAY
19:55:57  TO TAKE  EMISSIONS AWAY FROM DIESEL IS
19:56:00  TO HEAT THE EXHAUST.
IN CASES OF
19:56:03  LARGE GENERATORS WITH THE AIR QUALITY DISTRICT YOU CAN'T GO
19:56:07  OUT THERE AND PUT  DIFF IN IT AND MANAGE
19:56:10  IT.
THERE ARE ACTUALLY HEATERS THAT ACTUALLY TAKE E
19:56:13 MISSIONS AWAY.
SO CORRELATING BACK TO
19:56:16  CATALYTIC CONVERTER.
SO AGAIN JUST FOOD FOR THOUGHT
19:56:20 , YOU KNOW, THINKING IN THE FUTURE
19:56:23  FUTURE, OUR FIRM ALSO DOES
19:56:27  THE HYDROGEN FUEL CELLS THROUGHOUT
19:56:30  THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.
GAS STATIONS, THAT IS
19:56:33 .
YOU KNOW, ALONG
19:56:37  WITH THE GRANT FROM THE FEDS AND THE EPA,
19:56:40  AND YOU KNOW, WE HAVE HUNDREDS OF THEM.
AND SO THINGS
19:56:43  ARE CHANGING.
YOU KNOW, WITH ELECTRIC
19:56:46  CARS AND HYDROGEN.
SO YOU KNOW, THE DAY
19:56:50  IS COMING, AND IT'S A STEP BY STEP TO
19:56:53  GET THERE.
AND NOT
19:56:56  A SHOCK AND AWE OF HAPPENING ONE
19:57:01  DAY.
SO STARBUCKS IS YOU KNOW THE LEADING EDGE WHEN
19:57:04  IT COMES TO THESE CONCERNS, YOU KNOW, THEY ALREADY
19:57:08  HAD THEIR TPM PLAN
19:57:11  IN PLACE, THAT THEY USE AS A CORPORATION
19:57:15 .
WE DO HAVE THE
19:57:18  CROSS-ACCESS AND THERE WAS A LOT OF
19:57:22  BACK AND FORTH, THE PLAN THAT'S BEFORE YOU TONIGHT,
19:57:25  CHANGED OVER THE COURSE OF
19:57:28  TIME TO BRING FORWARD THIS PLAN WITH
19:57:32  THE DRIVE-THROUGH STACKING THAT
19:57:35 
IS SUPERIOR ON THIS SITE.
WITH THAT, IF
19:57:38  THERE'S ANY QUESTIONS I'LL BE HAPPY TO ANSWER THEM
19:57:42 .
>> Commissioner Daulton:   BEFORE WE DO THAT I WOULD LIKE TO ASK
19:57:45  TRISH IF SHE HAS ANY PUBLIC SPEAKERS ON THIS ITEM
19:57:49 .
>> CHAIRPERSON, WE DO NOT HAVE ANY
19:57:52  SPEAKERS.
THANK YOU.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   OKAY, THANK 
19:57:55 YOU.
IN THAT CASE, YES, WE COULD OPEN
19:57:59  QUESTIONS FOR THE APPLICANT FROM THE COMMISSION.
DO WE HAVE
19:58:02  ANY QUESTIONS FOR APPLICANT
19:58:05 ?
19:58:10 
NOTHING, ALL RIGHT.
WOULD YOU LIKE TO GIVE US ANY CLOSE
19:58:14 ING REMARKS SIR?
>> NO, I -- WELL
19:58:17  IN CLOSING, THE HARD WORK WITH THE STAFF
19:58:20  HAS BEEN EXCEPTIONAL.
AND WE GREATLY APPRECIATE
19:58:25  THEIR SUPPORT.
MARC WAS ALWAYS THERE
19:58:29 .
IT'S VERY -- IT'S NOT VERY OFTEN THAT YOU COULD E-MAIL
19:58:32  A PLANNER AND GET AN ANSWER BACK
19:58:35  WITHIN THE SAME DAY, IF NOT THE NEXT MORNING
19:58:39 .
SO KUDOS TO YOU MARC.
19:58:42 
>> Commissioner Daulton:   OKAY, KATHY DID I SEE YOUR HAND UP?
19:58:45 
>> Commissioner McDonald:   SORRY COMMISSIONER DAULTON.

19:58:48 IT'S TAKING ME A WHILE.
MY SCREEN IS BLOCKING OUT MY
19:58:51  RAISED HAND SO I'M TRYING TO DO IT MANUALLY
19:58:54 .
I'M SORRY.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   GO AHEAD
19:58:57 .
>> Commissioner McDonald:    MR. MOMMER THANK YOU.
19:59:01 
I UNDERSTAND STARBUCKS HAS ALWAYS BEEN A LEADING EDGE
19:59:04  COMPANY FOR ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY
19:59:08  ACTIVITIES AND  SUPPORTING PROGRESSIVE
19:59:11  PROJECTS.
SO WITH THAT IN MIND, AND
19:59:15  KNOWING HOW MUCH MONEY AND TIME AND
19:59:18  INFRASTRUCTURE FREMONT HAS INVESTED INTO OUR
19:59:22  BIKE TRAILS AND OUR BIKE ROUTES AND
19:59:26  OUR ALTERNATE MODES OF TRANSPORTATION
19:59:30 , AND KNOWING
19:59:33  THAT
19:59:37 
YES THERE IS ANNAL IMPACT FOR THESE TD
19:59:41 M MEASURES IF THERE ARE DOLLARS, DO
19:59:44  YOU KNOW THAT WE HAVE A HOPPER PROGRAM IN THE CITY OF FREMONT?
19:59:47 
>> NO.
>> Commissioner McDonald:   WE HAVE A 
19:59:50 BIKE SHARE PROGRAM THAT YOU CAN ENROLL IN FOR $60 A  YEAR.
AND
19:59:53  I THINK THAT'S A DOLLAR A MINUTE AFTERWARDS.
SO IT'S
19:59:56  A PRETTY AFFORDABLE PROGRAM AND IT PROVIDES
20:00:00  ALTERNATE TRANSPORTATION  OPTIONS.
SO IF YOU
20:00:03  COULD ENROLL YOUR EMPLOYEES IN A PROGRAM LIKE  THAT, WHICH
20:00:06  ONLY COSTS $60 A YEAR PER EMPLOYEE
20:00:54 
>> Commissioner McDonald:   I'M SORRY, DID I JUST KICK THAT OFF
20:00:57 ?
>> THERE WE GO.
>> Planner Pullen:   I DID TOO.

20:01:00 IT MUST HAVE BEEN A SYSTEM THING.
I THINK WE'RE ALL COMING
20:01:03  BACK.
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.
THIS IS TRISH.
20:01:06 
THAT WAS REALLY STRANGE.
MY CONNECTION IS PERFECT
20:01:10  SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.
>> I
20:01:13  THINK IT HAD TO DO WITH THE BICYCLES BUT I DON'T KNOW.
>> Planner Pullen:  
20:01:16  EVERYONE IS HERE EXCEPT DANIEL.
DID YOU HEAR THE QUESTION
20:01:19   MR. MOMMER?
>> I DID, AND I COULD
20:01:23  NOT ANSWER THAT.
THAT'S A
20:01:26  CORPORATE DECISION THAT GOES
20:01:30  INTO DIFFERENT -- YOU KNOW, YOU'RE TALK
20:01:34 ING BOOK WORK AND WHATNOT FOR
20:01:37  A CORPORATION FOR AN ISOLATED STORE.
SO I KNOW I
20:01:40  COULD NOT ANSWER THAT
20:01:43  TONIGHT.
YOU KNOW AS I LOOK AT THEIR PROGRAM, YOU KNOW, IT'S
20:01:47  NOT THERE, OF PROVIDING FUNDING
20:01:50  FOR BICYCLE PER EMPLOYEE.
IF IT
20:01:54  WAS THERE I COULD SAY YES.
>> Commissioner McDonald:   IT'S A BIKE SHARE
20:01:57  PROGRAM.
>> BIKE SHARE.
>> Commissioner McDonald:   IT
20:02:01  WOULD BE ENROLLMENT INTO A BIKE SHARE PROGRAM.
YOU GET TO
20:02:04  PICK UP A BICYCLE ANYWHERE IN THEIR
20:02:07  STATION,  UNLOCK IT USING
20:02:11  THEIR MEMBERSHIP AND YOU CAN RIDE THE BIKE TO
20:02:14  WORK AND HOME AND IT GETS
20:02:17  PICKED UP.
IT ALLOWS THEM TO GO THAT LAST
20:02:20  MILE.
I'M LOOKING FOR WAYS TO MAKE
20:02:23  THIS TDM SOMEWHAT
20:02:26  MORE ATTRACTIVE THAN A $20 NERVE
20:02:29  THAT MIGHT NOT GET THEM TO WORK MORE THAN TWO OR THREE DAYS
20:02:32  A WEEK.
>> BUT MAYBE YOU MISSED IT.
AS A
20:02:36  CORPORATION, THEY'RE ALREADY GOING
20:02:39  ABOVE THE $20 AND
20:02:43   THEY'LL PLAY THE
20:02:46  EMPLOYEES  SUBWAY, BART, TRAIN
20:02:49 .
>> Commissioner McDonald:   SO THEY SUBSIDIZE ALL PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION
20:02:52  IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO SAY ALREADY?
>> YES, IT
20:02:56  SAYS BUS TRAIN SUBWAY
20:02:59  FERRY, TRANSIT VEHICLES AND
20:03:02  STREETCAR FARES.

20:03:06 >> Commissioner McDonald:    OKAY.
I DID NOT SEE THAT
20:03:09  IN THE PACKAGE.
SO IT'S
20:03:14  -- IF THAT'S ACTUALLY THE CASE
20:03:17 , WHERE THE EMPLOYER PAYS TRANSPORTATION COST
20:03:20 , PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION COST
20:03:24 , THEN I MEAN
20:03:27  I'M OKAY WITH THE TDM.

20:03:35 >> Commissioner Daulton:   ALL RIGHT, ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FOR APPLICANT?
IF NOT I'D
20:03:39  LIKE TO CLOSE THE PUBLIC PART OF THIS HEARING AND BRING IT
20:03:42  BACK TO QUESTIONS FOR STAFF.

20:03:46 ANY, COMMISSIONERS, HAVE A QUESTION FOR STAFF
20:03:50 ?
I KNOW SOMEBODY MUST.
>> Commissioner McDonald:  
20:03:53  DO  I.
THANK YOU.
GOING
20:03:56  BACK TO MARC.
I DID NOT
20:04:00  SEE THAT THE
20:04:04  EMPLOYER
20:04:08  PAYS PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION COST FOR THEIR EMPLOYEES
20:04:12  IN THE PACKET.
CAN WE MAKE THAT A CONDITION?
>> I
20:04:15  MEAN THAT'S A CORPORATE POLICY.
I WOULD DEFER TO HEATHER
20:04:19  WHETHER WE COULD PUT THAT AS A CONDITION BUT THAT'S SEPARATE FOR
20:04:22  US.
THEY ALSO HAVE A PROGRAM FOR  PRETAX
20:04:25  DOLLARS BEING SET ASIDE FOR
20:04:28  TRANSPORTATIONING AS WELL, THAT'S AT A
20:04:32  CORPORATE LEVEL.
I'M NOT SURE WE CAN PUT THAT
20:04:35  AS A CONDITION OF APPROVAL.
>> I THINK YOU WOULD
20:04:39  MIGHT WAK WANT TO ASK THE APPLICANT IF THAT IS SOMETHING THEY WOULD AGREE
20:04:42  TO.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   SHE DID.
20:04:45 
>> SO WHAT COSH
20:04:49  COULD BE AGREED TO IS STARBUCKS WOULD
20:04:52  PROVIDE TRANSPORTATION FUNDING IN ACCORDANCE TO
20:04:56  THEIR -- THEIR, WHAT DO THEY CALL IT
20:05:00 , COMMUTER BENEFIT
20:05:03  PROGRAM, THEIR CORPORATE COMMUTER
20:05:06 
 BENEFIT PROGRAM.
>> Commissioner McDonald:    MR. MOM
20:05:09 MER MARC JUST SAID THAT THEY PROVIDE A
20:05:13  PRE-TAX DOLLAR ACCOUNT FOR TRANSPORTATION.

20:05:18 SO IT'S THE EMPLOYEE'S DOLLARS.
IS THAT CORRECT
20:05:22 ?
>> IT --
20:05:25  I DON'T KNOW ABOUT  THAT.
WHAT I SET HERE,
20:05:28  IT SAYS HERE
20:05:32 , WHAT ITEMS, WHAT EXPENSES ARE ELIGIBLE AND IT
20:05:35  SAYS IRS REGULATIONS ALLOW THE FOLLOWING WORK RELATE
20:05:39 ED TRANSPORTATION EXPENSES TO BE COVERED.

20:05:43 AND THEN IT LISTS OUT --
>> Commissioner McDonald:   BUT
20:05:46  ELIGIBLE FOR WHAT IS THE QUESTION AND ACCORDING TO MARC
20:05:49  IT WAS A PRE-TAX ACCOUNT
20:05:52 .
>> Commissioner Daulton:   COMMISSIONER, CAN I STOP YOU
20:05:55  FOR A MOMENT?
WE HAVE CLOSED THE PUBLIC HEARING
20:05:59  SO MR. MOMMER IS NO  LONGER AVAILABLE
20:06:02 .
DIRECT YOUR QUESTIONS TO MARC OR JOEL SEE
20:06:05  HOW WE DO.
>> Commissioner McDonald:   GOING BACK TO MARC, MARC YOU
20:06:09  SAID THE EMPLOYER PROVIDES A  PRETAX SPENDING
20:06:12  ACCOUNT FOR TRANSPORTATION.
>> AND THIS IS SOMETHING I'VE
20:06:15  JUST GOT FROM JOEL THAT LOOKS LIKE WE GOOGLED
20:06:18  REAL QUICK SO I DON'T WANT TO SPEAK WITH 100% AUTHORITY LIKE
20:06:21  I KNOW WHAT WE'RE DOING.
AGAIN A LOT OF THIS IS CORPORATE
20:06:25  POLICY OF STARBUCKS THAT YOU'RE ASKING ME ABOUT SO LET ME
20:06:28  READ EXACTLY WHAT IT SAYS BEFORE I ANSWER.

20:06:36 
>> Planner Pullen:   AND I WANT TO REITERATE BACK
20:06:39  TO WHERE WE WERE WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS.
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT
20:06:42  A VERY SMALL AMOUNT OF DIFFERENCE GIVEN THE
20:06:46  OVERALL THRESHOLD AMOUNT.
SO I THINK
20:06:49  THE NUMBERS YOU SAW BEFORE WERE 15.7 AND 16
20:06:52 .6 AND  15.4.
THESE ARE IF YOU LOOK AT
20:06:56  A  50,000 SQUARE FOOT RETAIL BUILDING THE NUMBERS
20:06:59  WOULD BE MUCH LARGER AND THAT WOULD FALL UNDERNEATH
20:07:02  THE THRESHOLD.
WHAT WE DID WITH TRANSPORTATION WAS TO MAKE
20:07:06  SURE THAT IT WAS
20:07:09  A LESSER NUMBER, THAT WAS
20:07:13  NOT SOMETHING THAT WAS GOING TO CAUSE A PROBLEM WITH RESPECT
20:07:17  TO THE COMPARISON OF THE
20:07:20  THRESHOLD AND VERSUS
20:07:23  A NON,
YOU KNOW,
20:07:26  ANOTHER TYPE OF BUILDING THAT WOULD CLEARLY FALL WITHIN THE
20:07:30  THRESHOLD.
AND THE REASON IT'S VOLUNTARY IS BECAUSE IT'S SUCH
20:07:33  A SMALL NUMBER AND IN THE OPINION OF THE
20:07:36  TRANSPORTATION FOLKS,
20:07:42  WHO DO THIS ON A REGULAR BASIS, MEETS
20:07:45  THE STANDARD.
REQUIRING SOMETHING ELSE, YOU KNOW IT IS TRUE
20:07:48 , AS HEATHER 
20:07:51  SAID, SOME CONDITION IF YOU WERE TO
20:07:54  WANT TO PROPOSE IT, IT WOULD NEED TO BE ACCEPTED BY THE APPLICANT IN
20:07:57  ORDER TO MAKE IT VIABLE, AND I
20:08:01 
THINK YOU'VE HEARD FROM THE APPLICANT THAT THEY DEVELOPED THE SITE
20:08:04  AND THEN THERE'S AN OWNER WHO THEN LEASES IT
20:08:24  TO STARBUCKS.
SO WE'RE KIND EVER GOING -- THERE IS
20:08:27  A THIRD FATHER WHO IS NOT AT THE TABLE THAT WOULD
20:08:30  BE THE BENEFICIARY OF WHATEVER REQUIREMENT
20:08:33  YOU WOULD PUT ON THIS WE DON'T KNOW IF ULTIMATELY THEY COULD
20:08:36  COMPLY
WITH IT.
STAFF WOULD STRONGLY RECOMMEND THE 
20:08:39 STAFF PROPOSAL, RECOMMENDATION.

20:08:50 >> Commissioner Daulton:   KATHY ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS FOR STAFF?
>> Commissioner McDonald:   THE REASON 
20:08:53 I'M GOING DOWN THIS LINE IS WE HAVE NOT HAD MUCH OPPORTUNITY TO
20:08:56  REALLY LOOK AT, YOU KNOW, THE NEW TD
20:09:00 M.
AND ALL THESE CHANGES THAT ARE COMING DOWN THE PIKE
20:09:03 .
AND I THINK THAT YOU KNOW,
20:09:06  THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO
20:09:10  ADDRESS HOW WE'RE GOING TO BE LOOKING AT THIS TD
20:09:13 M THING MOVING FORWARD.
AND I'M JUST
20:09:16  CONCERNED THAT WHEN WE -- YOU KNOW, AS MINOR AS IT IS
20:09:21 , LEAVING EVERYTHING UP TO THE
20:09:25  WILL OF WHICHEVER
20:09:28  EMPLOYEES MIGHT BE COME DOWN THE PIKE.
AND
20:09:31  COMING DOWN THE PIKE
20:09:34  AND HOWEVER THEY MIGHT BE
20:09:39  INCENTIVIZED BY THIS $20 INCENTIVE.
20:09:42 
I DON'T THINK IT'S AN EFFECTIVE INCENTIVE TO GET PEOPLE OUT OF THEIR 
20:09:45 CARS.
AND I GUESS
20:09:48  WHAT I'M SAYING IS, AS WE MOVE FORWARD, THESE TD
20:09:52 Ms HAVE TO BECOME MORE OF
20:09:55  AN ACTUAL INCENTIVE, TO CREATE
20:09:59  THE OUTCOME THAT WE WANT.

20:10:02 AND NOT JUST SOMETHING
20:10:05  THAT  TICKS A BOX.

20:10:17 AND THAT'S WHERE I'LL STAND FOR TODAY.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   ANY
20:10:20  OTHER QUESTIONS FROM COMMISSIONERS?
I HAVE A QUESTION.
YES
20:10:24 , COMMISSIONER DAULTON.
YOU'VE SAID SEVERAL TIMES NOW
20:10:27  THAT THESE TWO PERCENTAGE POINTS OR
20:10:31  TWO 10th OF A PERCENT THAT WE'RE LOOKING
20:10:34  AT HERE FROM 15 MUCH 7
20:10:37  TO 15.4 IS A VERY
20:10:40  MINOR NUMBER.
LIKE IF YOU COULD
20:10:43  GET ONE OF YOUR EMPLOYEES TO RIDE A BIKE
20:10:48  TO THE JOB, TEN MILES,
20:10:51  ONCE EVERY TWO WEEKS, YOU'D PROBABLY BE UNDER THE LIMIT
20:10:54 .
SOMETHING LIKE THAT, RIGHT?
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A AFFIRM
20:11:01  FAIRLY SMALL OPERATION HERE.
SO THE LARGER QUESTION -- I DON'T
20:11:04  REALLY HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE IDEA THAT SIMPLY HAVING THE TRANSPORTATION
20:11:08  MANAGER INVOLVED IS MITIGATION.
OKAY
20:11:11 ?
I UNDERSTAND THAT IDEA, ALTHOUGH I -- IT IS A
20:11:14  LITTLE BIT FUZZY.

20:11:19 THE REAM QUESTION THOUGH IS, IF WE'RE NOT GOING TO FULLY
20:11:22  LOOK FOR ENFORCEMENT OF THAT SMALL AMOUNT, THEN ARE WE CHASE
20:11:25 ING PROBLEMS LATER ON?
ARE WE GOING TO
20:11:29  CAUSE OURSELVES PROBLEMS LATER ON WHEN SOMEBODY COULD SAY WELL
20:11:32 , YOU KNOW, YOU LET THAT 3
20:11:35 /10 OF A PERCENT GO OVER HERE AND YOU
20:11:39  LET 4/10 OF
20:11:42  A PERCENT GO
20:11:45  HERE, IT LOOSENS UP
20:11:48 
OUR ORDINANCE.
IS THAT WHAT WE WANT TO DO?

20:11:59 >> Planner Pullen:   I STARTED TALKING ON NOOUT.
TO THE
20:12:03  EXTENT WE HAVE MANDATORY VERSUS VOLUNTARY,
20:12:06  WE USE VOLUNTARY MEASURES, ARE WE  CHECKING BACK IN, ARE
20:12:10  WE SEEING HOW THEY'RE WORKING, ARE WE REALLY GETTING AN UNDERSTAND
20:12:13 ING?
I THINK THERE IS A WAY TO
20:12:17  DO THAT AND I THINK IT MIGHT BE
20:12:20  A GOOD METHOD OF ACHIEVING THAT
20:12:23 .
AND, YOU KNOW, I HAVEN'T RAISED THIS
20:12:26  TO THE APPLICANT.
IN THE PAST WE USED TO DO
20:12:29  USE PERMIT REVIEWS AND THINGS LIKE THAT.
I DON'T WANT TO SEND
20:12:32  THIS BACK TO THE COMMISSION BUT I THINK WE COULD REQUEST THE
20:12:36  APPLICANT TO PROVIDE AFTER THE FIRST YEAR THEY'RE IN OPERATION OR
20:12:39  SOMETHING LIKE THAT, A SUMMARY OF
20:12:42  THE OUTCOME OF
THOSE VOLUNTARY COMMUTER
20:12:45  MEASURES.
AND THAT WOULD
20:12:48  INCLUDE, YOU KNOW, HOW PEOPLE ARE GETTING TO WORK ON A
20:12:51  REGULAR BASIS, IT MIGHT INCLUDE WHAT KIND OF BENEFITS THEY PROVIDED
20:12:55 .
AND IT WOULDN'T BE A -- IT WOULDN'T BE A
20:12:58  CHECK BOX IN THE SENSE THAT MAYBE THEY HAD A T
20:13:01 DM PERSON ON STAFF AND MAYBE THEY DID
20:13:04  A GOOD JOB OR MAYBE THEY DIDN'T.
IT WOULD BE MORE
20:13:07  OF A HERE IS HOW THIS WORKED YOU KNOW CITY
20:13:11  AND WE COULD TRANSMIT THAT TO YOU AND LET YOU KNOW AND
20:13:14  THAT COULD BE SOMETHING YOU COULD KEEP IN MIND FOR FUTURE SUCH APPLICATIONS
20:13:17 .
>> Commissioner Daulton:   THAT WAS MY NEXT QUESTION WAS HOW IS THIS ENFORCE
20:13:20 ED DOWN THE ROAD.
BUT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS, WE
20:13:23  COULD ASK FOR FEEDBACK AFTER A YEAR
20:13:27  AROUND THEN IF THAT
20:13:31  VMT WERE STILL NOT BEING MET THEN WHERE DO WE GO
20:13:35 ?
>> Planner Pullen:   I RECOMMEND IT BE
20:13:38  SELF-POLICING.
IN YOUR
20:13:41  USE PERMIT, YOU HAVE A CONDITION OF
20:13:45  APPROVAL, MARC MAY BE ABLE TO PULL IT UP AND READ IT,
20:13:48  THAT SAYS THE APPLICANT SHALL COMPLY WITH ALL  CONDITIONS, ON
20:13:52  AN ONGOING BASIS, ET CETERA.

20:13:55 IT WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT TO REACH INTO A VOLUNTARY PROGRAM LIKE
20:13:58  THAT AND RISE TO A LEVEL OF A REVOCATION OF A
20:14:01  USE PERMIT.
BUT I THINK IT COULD BE SELF POLICING IN THE SENSE
20:14:04  THAT IF THEY KNOW THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO PROVIDE
20:14:07  THAT INFORMATION, THEY'RE GOING TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE THE
20:14:10  TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THOSE COMMUTER BENEFITS
MORE.

20:14:14 THEY'RE GOING TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO NOTE WHEN THEY HAVE
20:14:17  AND THAT MIGHT IN ITSELF CREATE MORE COMPLIANCE
20:14:20 .
JUST A THOUGHT.
I DON'T THINK I WANT TO BRING THIS 
20:14:23 INTO -- BACK TO THE COMMISSION BECAUSE WE'VE GOT A LOT OF
20:14:26  BUSINESS COMING IN.
LOT OF PEOPLE DOING THESE  THINGS.
AND
20:14:30  IT'S FORTUNATE BUT THIS IN ITSELF IS NOT GOING TO BE
20:14:34  A -- AN ITEM WE WANT TO BRING BACK TO A
20:14:38  COMMISSION OVER AND OVER AND OVER FOR BUSINESSES.
WE JUST DON'T HAVE
20:14:41  THE CAPACITY TO DO THAT.
20:14:45 
>> Commissioner Daulton:   KATHY DO YOU HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION?

20:14:48 COMMISSIONER McDONALD.
>> Commissioner McDonald:   YES, SORRY
20:14:51 .
SO JOEL.
I GUESS
20:14:54  MY ISSUE HERE IS THAT IT IS ALL SELF-
20:14:57 POLICED, SELF
20:15:05  -- THEY'RE ENCOURAGED BUT THERE IS NO CONSEQUENCE.
20:15:08 
THERE IS
20:15:11  ABSOLUTELY NO CONSEQUENCE IN THIS TDM FOR NON
20:15:14  NONPERFORMANCE.
AND WE HAVE NO RECOURSE TO
20:15:17  DO ANYTHING ONCE WE MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS.
IS THERE
20:15:21  A WAY THAT THEY CAN BE
20:15:24  REVIEWED BY THE CITY?
THAT
20:15:28  A RECORD IS FILED AND IF THEY
20:15:31  DON'T MEET SOME MINIMUM GUIDELINE
20:15:36 , THAT THERE IS SOME CONSEQUENCE
20:15:40 ?
>> Planner Pullen:   AND I'M HEARING THIS DISCUSSION IN
20:15:43  THE FRAME OF, A STARBUCKS.
BUT I
20:15:46  THINK YOU MAY BE THINKING OF IT AS A LARGER
20:15:49 , WELL, WHAT IF THIS WERE, YOU KNOW, A
20:15:53  NEW MANUFACTURER OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT, HOW WOULD WE ADDRESS IT
20:15:57 ?
AND I CAN RESPECT THAT KIND OF LINE OF
20:16:00  THINKING AND I UNDERSTAND THAT LINE OF  THINKING.
I DON'T THINK THIS IS THE
20:16:03  USE TO TRY THAT ON IN TERMS OF
20:16:07  TAKING THE VOLUNTARY MEASURE THAT TRANSPORTATION
20:16:10  THINKS IS SUFFICIENT.
AND TO HAVE THIS
20:16:13  BE THE ONE WHERE WE ARE GOING TO TURN IT INTO
20:16:16  A KIND OF A CODE ENFORCEMENT OF
20:16:20  THEIR TRANSPORTATION MEASURES.
WE DON'T HAVE THE CAPACITY
20:16:23  TO DO THAT.
WE PUT THE MEASURES IN
20:16:26  PLACE.
THEY DO THEM ON A VOLUNTARY BASIS
20:16:30 .
BUSINESSES DIFFER.
SOME THINGS MAY BE
20:16:33  SUCCESSFUL WITH CERTAIN WORKFORCES THAN OTHERS, AND I
20:16:36  THINK THAT'S BEST LEFT TO THE PLIBT
20:16:39  APPLICANT.
THEY CAN COME BACK TO OUR
20:16:42  TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERS AND PROPOSE DIFFERENT THINGS
20:16:45  OR BOUNCE IDEAS OFF.
WE DON'T HAVE SOMEONE WHO'S CHECKING UP
20:16:49  ON THESE THINGS AND I DON'T THINK WE HAVE THE FRAMEWORK OR THE STAFFING TO
20:16:52  HAVE SOMEONE WHO IS CHECKING UP ON ALL THESE PROGRAMS.
IT'S
20:16:55  SOMETHING THAT WE WANT THEM TO DO.
AND I THINK
20:16:59  THAT A REPORT WOULD DO THAT IN A WAY THAT'S
20:17:02  NOT INTENSIVE FOR CITY FROM A
20:17:05  STAFFING STANDPOINT.

20:17:09 >> Commissioner McDonald:    OKAY, I'M JUST, YOU KNOW, I'M LOOKING AT
20:17:13  THIS DRIVE-THROUGH AND, GRANTED, WHAT IS IT
20:17:16 , ONE IN SEVEN OR ONE IN 13
20:17:19  CARS ARE ELECTRIC, AND
20:17:23  THAT POTENTIALLY,
20:17:26  THERE -- I
THOUGHT IDLING CARS AS FAR AS I
20:17:29  REMEMBER HEARING FROM BEFORE EMIT HIGHER
20:17:32   EMISSIONS THAN STOPPING AND STARTING.
BUT YOU
20:17:35  KNOW WHATEVER THE APPLICANT
20:17:38  SUGGESTS.
WE STILL HAVE A LOT OF CARS COMING IN TO
20:17:42  GET COFFEES.
AND I THINK
20:17:45  THAT, YOU KNOW, AS MUCH AS WE WANT TO BELIEVE
20:17:49  THAT ALL OUR CARS ARE GOING TO
20:17:52  GO ELECTRIC IN THE NEAR FUTURE, I THINK
20:17:55  THERE IS, IF WE LISTEN TO OUR SUSTAIN
20:18:00 ABILITY COMMISSION,
20:18:03  AS MUCH AS
WE WANT TO GET THESE HIGH GH
20:18:07 G VEHICLES OFF THE ROAD THERE IS GOING TO BE A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE THAT
20:18:10  WE DON'T GET OFF THE ROAD.
20:18:13 
AND, YOU KNOW, A DRIVE-
20:18:17 THROUGH DRAWS THOSE
20:18:21  EXTRA VEHICLES TO STOP AND TO SWING
20:18:24  THROUGH THIS AREA.
WHICH IS ALREADY
20:18:27  AS WE DISCUSSED HIGH
20:18:30 LY
20:18:33  CONGESTED.
I JUST WANT TO PUT SOMETHING
20:18:37  INTO PLACE THAT IS MORE OF A GUARANTEE THAN THIS
20:18:40  HIGHLY VOLUNTARY PROGRAM.
SO THAT'S, YOU
20:18:43  KNOW, ALL I'LL SAY ON THAT SUBJECT.
THANK YOU.

20:18:47 >> Commissioner Daulton:   ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FOR STAFF ON THIS?

20:18:52 CAN I GET A MOTION?

20:18:58 >> Commissioner Liu:   I MOVE TO ACCEPT THE STAFF'S RECOMMENDATION
20:19:02  AS-IS.
>> Commissioner Steckler:   I SECOND
20:19:05 .
>> Commissioner Daulton:   I WOULD, IF I COULD I WOULD OFFER A FRIENDLY
20:19:08  AMENDMENT FOR A REPORT FROM THE APPLICANT
20:19:12  REGARDING THEIR MITIGATION EFFORTS FOR
20:19:16  THE VMT IN A YEAR, BACK TO THE
20:19:19  COMMISSION.
IS THAT ACCEPTABLE?

20:19:23 CHARLES?

20:19:26 >> Commissioner Liu:   WELL, I THINK ON THE SMALL -- I MEAN
20:19:30  THIS IS CERTAINLY A RELATIVELY
20:19:33  SMALL OPERATION.
I HAVE, IN THIS LOCATION I
20:19:37  FEEL THAT MANY OTHER SIMILAR OPERATIONS
20:19:41  WOULD BE FOR THOSE SMALL BUSINESSES, AND I
20:19:44  CERTAINLY THINK THAT SMALL BUSINESSES
20:19:47 , OUR LIVES ARE ALREADY HARD ENOUGH AND WE
20:19:51  SHOULD
MAKE IT EASY FOR THEM TO SET
20:19:55  UP SHOP IN FREMONT.
AND SMALL BUSINESSES SHOULD BE EXEMPT FROM
20:19:58  BEING REQUIRED TO SUBSIDIZE FOR THEIR EMPLOYEES
20:20:01  TO TAKE TRANSIT.
I THINK FOR
20:20:04  BIG PLAYERS LIKE TESLAS OF THE WORLD
20:20:07  IT MAKES ALL THE SENSE BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE MEANS TO DO
20:20:11  SO.
AND WE JUST NEED TO MAKE IT FRIENDLY
20:20:14  FOR SMALL BUSINESSES
20:20:18  AN UPSHOT.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   I DO TEND TO AGREE WITH THAT
20:20:21 .
I OFFER THE AMENDMENT JUST IN CASE WE GOOD
20:20:24  GET AT SOME POINT LARGER ISSUES LIKE THIS
20:20:27  COME BACK TO  US.
I WORRY THAT WE WON'T BE ALLOWED TO DO
20:20:30  IT LATER IF WE LET IT GO HERE.

20:20:34 BUT I DO UNDERSTAND YOUR RETICENCE TO
20:20:37  PUT THAT ON THIS APPLICANT.
SO WE HAVE A MOTION AND
20:20:40  SECOND.
JOEL
20:20:43 .
>> Planner Pullen:  
20:20:46  WHEN I CALL YOUR NAME ON THE MOTION TO APPROVE
20:20:49  STAFF RECOMMENDATION, PLEASE STATE YOUR VOTE.

20:20:52 CHAIR YEE AND VICE CHAIR RAO AS NOTED ARE
20:20:56  ABSENT.
STARTING WITH CHAIR DAULTON
20:20:59 .
>> Commissioner McDonald:   BEFORE WE VOTE CAN WE JUST HAVE A
20:21:03  CLARIFICATION ON THE MOTION?
WAS THE AMENDMENT REJECTED?
20:21:04 
>> Commissioner Daulton:   YES, IT WAS.

20:21:08 >> Commissioner McDonald:   IT WAS REJECTED
20:21:10 .
>> Commissioner Daulton:   YES.
>> Commissioner McDonald:   WE'RE 
20:21:14 GOING STRAIGHT STAFF RECOMMENDATION.
>> Planner Pullen:   YES JUST TO
20:21:17  CLARIFY, STAFF RECOMMENDATION AS IN THE REPORT.
SO
20:21:20  CHAIR YEE AND VICE CHAIR RAO ABSENT.
STARTING
20:21:23  WITH CHAIR DAULTON.

20:21:29 NAY.
COMMISSIONER McDONALD
20:21:33 , NAY.

20:21:36 COMMISSIONER STECKLER.
AYE
20:21:40 .
COMMISSIONER CARDENAS, AYE.

20:21:43 AND COMMISSIONER LIU.
AYE.
SO THE VOTE
20:21:46  IS THREE IN FAVOR TWO OPPOSED
20:21:49  WITH TWO ABSENT.
THE PROJECTS
20:21:52  HAS BEEN APPROVED.
PLANNING COMMISSION ACTION
20:21:56  IS FINAL UNLESS APPEALED TO CITY COUNCIL WITHIN TEN CALENDAR DAYS
20:21:59  DAYS.
CHAIR BACK TO YOU.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   OKAY.

20:22:02 SINCE THAT IS OUR LAST AGENDA ITEM WE ARE GOING TO MOVE ON
20:22:06  TO MISCELLANEOUS ITEMS.
STAFF
20:22:09  UPDATES.
JOEL.
>> Planner Pullen:   ONLY STAFF UPDATE 
20:22:13 I WOULD HAVE IS THAT THE CITY COUNCIL HEARD
20:22:16  THE SAFE  PARKING ORDINANCE THAT YOU HAD SEEN
20:22:19  BEFORE, AND RECOMMENDED
20:22:23  OR APPROVED THAT SAFE PARKING ORDINANCE,
ALLOWING THE
20:22:26  USE OF RELIGIOUS FACILITIES
20:22:29  AND OTHER USES FOR SAFE PARKING FOR THE HOMELESS
20:22:32  AND THEY WILL BE BRINGING BACK IN THE NEAR
20:22:37  FUTURE A -- MORE INFORMATION TO THE COUNCIL ABOUT THE OPERATION
20:22:40  OF
THOSE FACILITIES.
JUST WANTED TO UPDATE YOU
20:22:43  SINCE YOU HAD ALREADY SEEN THAT ORDINANCE.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   I
20:22:46  HAVE A --
>> Commissioner McDonald:   JOEL --
20:22:49 
>> Commissioner Daulton:   SORRY GO AHEAD.

20:22:52 >> Commissioner McDonald:   I'M SORRY MAY I BE RECOGNIZED?
20:22:55 
THANK YOU.
>> Commissioner Daulton:  
20:22:59  COMMISSIONER McDONALD.
>> Commissioner McDonald:   JOEL CAN YOU TELL US HOW THEY
20:23:02  DECIDED ON ALL THE RECOMMENDS WE MADE
20:23:06  FOR ALTERING THAT TO INCLUDE PRIVATE PROPERTIES AND
20:23:09  SUCH?
>> Planner Pullen:   SO WHILE I DON'T
20:23:12  WANT TO, YOU KNOW, SPOIL
20:23:15  THE SOPHISTICATION OF THE MINUTES FOR THE COUNCIL BUT
20:23:19  I'LL SAY GENERALLY THERE WAS A LOT OF CONVERSATION ABOUT
20:23:22  BARRIERS TO ENTRY WITH
RESPECT TO WHAT KIND OF PROGRAM
20:23:25 MATIC DETAILS OF THE PROGRAM, THE KIND
20:23:30  OF  DISQUALIFYING FACTORS LET'S SAY OF EITHER VEHICLES
20:23:33  OR PEOPLE, THAT IT WOULD BE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE PROGRAM
20:23:36 .
THEY DID HAVE A DISCUSSION ABOUT THAT AT LENGTH.

20:23:39 AND THAT WAS
20:23:43  KIND OF INCLUDED IN THE DECISION MAKING AND
20:23:46  THE  VOTE.
BUT ULTIMATELY THEY DECIDED TO GO WITH THE
20:23:49  STAFF  RECOMMENDATION.
AND THERE WAS
20:23:52  -- THERE IS MORE TO IT THAN THAT BUT I DON'T WANT TO
20:23:55  GO INTO ALL THE BACK-AND-
20:23:58  BACK-AND-FORTH.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   YEAH.
I'LL SAY.

20:24:05 SO MY QUESTION JOEL IS WHEN ARE WE GOING TO HAVE IN-
20:24:08 PERSON MEETINGS AGAIN?
>> Planner Pullen:   WE'VE NOT DECIDED
20:24:11  THAT YET.
THIS IS A GOOD OPPORTUNITY ACTUALLY.
I DID GET
20:24:15  SOME INTEREST FROM THE COMMISSION AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY ON WHAT
20:24:18  THE CITY'S PLANS WERE WITH REGARD TO OPENING THE
20:24:21  CITY UP.
WE PUT SOME NEWS OUT ON
20:24:25  THE DEVELOPMENT DIGEST OR THE FREMONT
20:24:28  CONNECTION RECENTLY SO YOU MAY HAVE SEEN THAT.
BUT IN A NUTSHELL
20:24:32  STAFF IS GOING TO BE GOING BACK TO THE OFFICE
20:24:35 , AND DIFFERENT JOBS GO DIFFERENT NUMBERS OF DAYS.
WE
20:24:38  ARE BEING ALLOWED TO WORK FROM HOME SOME DAYS
20:24:42 .
BUT WE'RE OPENING THE COUNTER FOR TWO
20:24:45  DAYS A WEEK TO START FOR PEOPLE DROPPING IN, AND TAKING
20:24:48  CARE OF PERMITTING QUESTIONS, IN
20:24:51  THE COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT.
EACH DIVISION
20:24:54  OF THE DEPARTMENT IN THE CITY IN OTHER PLACE VES DIFFERENT WAYS OF DOING
20:24:58  THINGS.
BUILDING INSPECTORS NEED TO BE THERE
20:25:01  EVERY DAY
20:25:04  DOING THEIR INSPECTIONS BUT PEOPLE DOING DESIGN REVIEW
20:25:08 , LIKE MARC MAY BE DOING HE CAN DO IT
20:25:11  AT HOME, BUT IT REALLY VARIES.
FOR THE
20:25:15  PUBLIC'S BENEFIT WE'RE OPEN TWO DAYS A WEEK FOR THEIR
20:25:18  QUESTIONS AND THEN WE'RE OPEN AN ADDITIONAL TWO DAYS A
20:25:21  WEEK FOR ISSUING PERMITS SO A TOTAL OF
20:25:24  FOUR DAYS A WEEK, FRIDAYS  CLOSED.
20:25:27 
I WAS ALSO GOING TO SAY, I JUST LOST IT
20:25:30  THAT -- OH, WE ALSO SURVEYED SOME OTHER LOCAL
20:25:33  CITIES AND WE FOUND OUT THAT WE'RE KIND OF ON
20:25:36  THE FOREFRONT OF REOPENING RELATIVE TO OTHER CITIES
20:25:40 .
ABOUT 40% OF CITIES ARE REOPENING
20:25:44  FOR COUNTER BUSINESS RIGHT NOW.
JUST FOR A COMPARISON.
SO
20:25:47  WE'RE DOING IT IN A MEASURED WAY.
WE'LL SEE
20:25:51  AT THE START OF THE NEW FISCAL YEAR ON JULY 6th WHETHER
20:25:54  PEOPLE ARE BEATING DOWN OUR DOORS OR WHETHER THEY
20:25:57  COME IN TRICKLING AND WILL HAVE TO SEE WHAT
20:26:00  THAT LOOKS LIKE OVER TIME TO SEE HOW
WE
20:26:03  RAMP UP OR DOWN STAFFING AND HOW PEOPLE ARE FEELING
20:26:08 .
>> Commissioner McDonald:   HOW DOES STAFF FEEL ABOUT THAT?

20:26:11 >> Commissioner Daulton:   I DO LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING YOU ALL
20:26:15  IN PERSON SOME DAY, FOR GOSH SAKES.
>> Planner Pullen: 
20:26:18   I DON'T HAVE ANY FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THAT, THAT'S A
20:26:21  COUPLE OF MONTHS OUT BEFORE WE KNOW.
>> Commissioner Daulton:  
20:26:24  OKAY, ARE THERE ANY OTHER -- IS THERE ANY
20:26:27  OTHER INFORMATION COMMISSIONERS WOULD LIKE TO SHARE WITH US HERE
20:26:30 ?
DANIEL?
I KNOW YOU ALWAYS HAVE SOMETHING
20:26:34  SOMETHING.
NO?
NOTHING
20:26:38 ?
>> Commissioner Cardenas:   NOTHING TONIGHT,
20:26:41  NOTHING  TONIGHT.
THANK YOU THOUGH.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   IF THERE IS
20:26:44  NO FURTHER INFORMATION FROM THE COMMISSION I WILL
