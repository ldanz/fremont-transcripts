19:06:42 (DOWNTOWN DISTRICT) TO ALLOW FOUR CURB-CUTS ON THE NORTHWEST SIDE OF

19:07:31 >> Commissioner Daulton:   FAIR ENOUGH.
19:07:34 
DO WOO
19:07:37  WE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS BY THE COMMISSIONERS FOR
19:07:41  STAFF?

19:07:54  SLIDES ARE WE TALKING ABOUT?

19:07:58 >> Planner Pullen:   COURTNEY.
19:08:01 
>> I BELIEVE ABOUT SIX SLIDES OR SO.
>> Commissioner Yee:  
19:08:05  SIX SLIDES?
WOULD THE REST OF THE COMMISSION LIKE
19:08:08  TO TAKE A LOOK AT THOSE SIX SLIDES
19:08:12 ?
>> Commissioner Liu:   I DO.

19:08:14 FTC.
>> Commissioner Yee:   I WOULD LIKE TO LOOK AT THEM.

19:08:17 >> Commissioner Daulton:   OKAY JOEL DO YOU THINK THAT WOULD BE ALL RIGHT IF WE SEE

OKAY, HERE WE GO
19:08:24 .

19:08:29 >> ALL RIGHT, GOOD EVENING COMMISSIONERS.
SO THE ITEM BEFORE YOU TONIGHT
19:08:33  IS SOME AMENDMENTS TO THE DOWNTOWN COMMUNITY PLAN AND ZONING
19:08:36  AS WELL AS THE GENERAL PLAN CONFORMITY FINDING
19:08:39 .
SO TONIGHT'S PRESENTATION VERY BRIEF
19:08:43  WILL BEGIN WITH SOME BACKGROUND ON THE
19:08:46  SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WHICH IS THE CAUSE OF THE ITEMS BEFORE YOU.
I
19:08:49  WILL THEN PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS AND THE
19:08:52  DOWNTOWN COMMUNITY PLAN AND DOING TEXT
19:08:55  AS WELL AS A BRIEF INTRODUCTION TO THE GENERAL PLAN
19:08:58  CONFORMITY FINDING AND
19:09:02  OUR
CONCLUSION WILL BE STAFF
19:09:06 'S RECOMMENDATION.
IN OCTOBER 2012,
19:09:10  THE CITY COUNCIL ADOPTED THE DOWNTOWN COMMUNITY PLAN LAND DESIGN GUIDELINES
19:09:13  WHICH SETS FORTH A VISION TO CREATE A MIXED USE SUSTAIN
19:09:16 ABLE VIBRANT AND PEDESTRIAN-ORIENTED
19:09:20  DOWNTOWN.
THE REDEVELOPMENT OF THE DOWNTOWN IS GOVERNED BY
19:09:23  THE DOWNTOWN COMMUNITY PLAN AND THE CORRESPONDING DOWNTOWN ZONING
19:09:26  DISTRICT.
THE MOST SIGNIFICANT STREET IN DOWNTOWN IS ITS
19:09:29  MAIN STREET WHICH IS CAPITOL AVENUE AND
19:09:33  IN 2014 AND 15 AFTER
19:09:36  2015 AFTER REQUISITION OF
19:09:41  THE CITIBANK PARCEL
19:09:45 , THE CITY EXTEND
19:09:49 ED FREMONT BOULEVARD, YOU CAN
SEE THE THAT ON
19:09:52  THE RED SQUARE ON THE SLIDE IN FRONT OF YOU.

19:09:55 AS THIS PROJECT, THE CITY CLOSED ACCESS POINT
19:10:00 , SUNHILL ENTERPRISE BE LLG
19:10:03  CLAIMS TO HAVE  HISTORICALLY
19:10:06  USED AS EGRESS FROM THEIR FORMATTER
19:10:09  CITIBANK PARCEL.
SUN
19:10:13 HILT FILED A LAWSUIT AGAINST THE CITY.
19:10:16 
IN JANUARY 2022 THE CITY COUNCIL AUTHORIZED
19:10:20  A SETTLEMENT WITH  SUNHILL.
IN
19:10:23  PART, FOUR ACCESS POINTS ALONG CAPITOL AVENUE
19:10:26  AND THAT THE CITY TRANSFERS
19:10:29  TWO SLIVERS OF ACCESS RIGHT-OF-WAY
19:10:32  LONG CAPITOL AVENUE TO SUN HILL.
THE ITEMS BEFORE YOU
19:10:36  TONIGHT PERTAIN TO THE EXECUTION OF THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT, AS IT
19:10:39  RELATES TO AMENDMENTS IN THE COMMUNITY PLAN AND THE CORRESPOND
19:10:43 ING ZONING TEXT AS WELL AS THE
19:10:47  GENERAL PLAN
CONFORMITY FINDING FOR THE DISPOSAL OF THE
19:10:50  ACTION SAYS WRIERVE FROM SUN HILL
19:10:53 .
THIS WOULD ALLOW FOR FOUR CUB CUTS
19:10:57  IN SPIFTD LOCATION HES ON THE NORTH SIDE OF
19:11:00  CAPITOL AVENUE BETWEEN STATE STREET AND FREMONT BOULEVARD.
THE
19:11:03  NEW CURB CUTS WOULD BE LIMITED TO TWO ACCESS POINTS THAT
19:11:06  SUNHILL WOULD BE ALLOWED TO INSTALL AS PART
19:11:10  OF THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT.
THE NORTHERN MOST OF THESE
19:11:13  CURB CUTS WOULD BE REOPENED ONLY TEMPORARILY IN THE
19:11:17  THE REOPENING OF AN ADJACENT BUILDING,
19:11:20  THAT CURB CUT IS MARKET IN RED ON
19:11:23  THE PRESENTATION AS WELL AS THE ADJACENT
BUILDING IDENTIFIED.

19:11:26 THE AMENDMENTS WOULD ALSO RECOGNIZE TWO
19:11:29  EXISTING CURB CUTS ON SUNHILL'S PROPERTY AT THE
19:11:32  STREET INTERSECTIONS OF MEMORIAL STREET AND DECLARATION STREET ALONG
19:11:36  CAPITOL AVENUE THAT WERE ACTUALLY INSTALLED
BY
19:11:39  THE CITY AS PART OF CAPITOL
19:11:43  AVENUE REQUISITION.
NEW CURB CUTS WOULD
19:11:47  REMAIN PROHIBITED ON THIS STRETCH OF ALCOHOL AVENUE.

19:11:50 EXHIBITS A AND B IN YOUR PACKET
19:11:53  TONIGHT CONTAIN THE RESOLUTION AND THE ORDINANCE THAT WOULD ALLOW
19:11:56  THE ADDITIONAL CURB CUTS THROUGH THE
19:12:00  DOWNTOWN COMMUNITY PLAN AND ZONING TEXT.
THE
19:12:03  SECOND PART OF THIS ITEM
19:12:06  IS GENERAL PLAN CONFORMITY FINDING WHICH IS REQUIRED UNDER
19:12:09  STATE LAW FOR THE DISPOSITION OF ANY CITY OWNED LAND
19:12:12 .
UNDER THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT REACHED BY THE TWO PARTIES
19:12:16  THE TWO MINOR SLIVERS OF LAND YOU SEE DIAGRAM
19:12:19 MED ON YOUR SCREEN WHICH ARE UNUSED
19:12:22  EXCESS RIGHT-OF-WAY, FROM THE
19:12:26  CAPITOL AVENUE EXTENSION
PROJECT WOULD BE EXTENDED TO THE
19:12:29  CITY.
CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT CODE REQUIRES
19:12:32  THAT A FINDING
19:12:35  OF GENERAL CONFORMITY PRIOR TO DISPOSITION BY
19:12:39  THE CITY.
A CONDITION,
19:12:42  REQUIRES THAT  SUNHILL CONVEY TO THE
19:12:45  PROPERTY AFTER THEY ARE TRANSFERRED.
FUTURE
19:12:48  REDEVELOPMENT OF THE ZONING DISPARL,
19:12:52  WOULD COMPLY TO THE POLICIES OF THE GENERAL PLAN AND THE
19:12:55  STANDARDS OF THE DOWNTOWN ZONING DISTRICT.

19:12:59 AFTER THE MILK HEARING TONIGHT
19:13:02  STAFF'S RECOMMENDATION IS TO FIND THE PROPOSED PROJECT EXEMPT
19:13:06  FROM THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT BECAUSE OF THE FINAL
19:13:10  ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT WAS
19:13:14 
PREVIOUSLY CERTIFIED, AND NO FURTHER ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW IS REQUIRED
19:13:17  BECAUSE THERE ARE NO SUBSTANTIAL CHANGES TO THE PROJECT OR
19:13:21  ITS CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WOULD WARRANT ADDITIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW.

19:13:24 ADDITIONALLY STAFF RECOMMENDS THAT THE PLANNING COMMISSION RECOMMEND THE CITY COUNCIL
19:13:27  FIND THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS CONSISTENT WITH THE GENERAL  PLAN, AND
19:13:30  FURTHER THE PUBLIC INTEREST AND ADOPT THE
19:13:33 
RESOLUTION AND ORDINANCE THAT MAKE THE REQUISITE AMENDMENTS
19:13:37  TO ALLOW THE CURB CUTS ON CAPITOL AVENUE.
ADDITIONALLY AND FINAL
19:13:40 LY STAFF RECOMMEND THAT PLANNING COMMISSION FIND THE
19:13:44  PROPOSED DISPOSITION OF THE TWO
19:13:49  SLIVERS EVER LAND TO
19:13:52  SUNHILL CONFORMS TO THE GENERAL PLAN.
THAT
19:13:55  CONCLUDES OUR PRESENTATION AND WE ARE AVAILABLE FOR ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE
19:13:58  ON THIS ITEM.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   THANK
19:14:01  YOU COURTNEY.
COMMISSIONERS, DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FOR STAFF
19:14:05 ?
COMMISSIONER LIU PLEASE.
>> Commissioner Liu:   YES.

19:14:09 WHEN THE LAND, TWO STRIPS
19:14:12  OF LAND WERE GIVEN
19:14:15  TO THE  DEVELOPER, DID THE CITY GET ANY
19:14:19  COMPENSATION FOR THAT?
19:14:22 
>> THANKS FOR QUESTION, COMMISSIONER LIU.

19:14:25 I'M CLIFF NGUYEN, ASSISTANT PLANNING MANAGER IF YOU DON'T KNOW
19:14:29  ME.
THE ANSWER TO YOUR
19:14:32  QUESTION IS, THIS IS PART OF THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT,
19:14:35  THESE SLIVERS OF LAND WHICH ARE UNUSED
19:14:38  ACCESS RIGHT-OF-WAY WOULD BE DISPOSEAND GIVEN
19:14:45  DISPOSED AND GIVEN TO THE
DEVELOPER AS PART OF THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT
19:14:48  AGREEMENT.
WE'RE NOT GETTING MONEY IN LIEU OF TRANSFERRING THE
19:14:51  LAND TO  THEM.

19:14:55 >> Commissioner Liu:   SO THE AMOUNT OF LAND IF I DID
19:14:58  ROUGH CALCULATION IS CLOSE TO AT LEAST ON ONE SLIVER,
19:15:02  ONE PART, IS
19:15:06  AROUND 7800 SQUARE FEET, THAT'S KIND
19:15:10  OF SIGNIFICANT.
>> YOU KNOW,
19:15:13  THERE IS PLATS AND LEGAL ATTACHED AS INFORMATION
19:15:16  1, COMBINED, BOTH SLIVERS,
19:15:19  ONE SLIVER IS APPROXIMATELY 5500 SQUARE FEET AND THE
19:15:22  OTHER ONE IS ROUGHLY 500 SQUARE FEET SO
19:15:26  IN TOTAL IT IS
ABOUT 6,000 SQUARE FEET.
THOSE TWO
19:15:29  SLIVERS ARE LAND ARE UNBUILDABLE AS THEY STAND
19:15:32 , AS THEY EXIST TODAY, THEY'RE ONLY ABOUT 20 FEET DEEP.
19:15:35 
AND SO IDEALLY, THAT LAND
19:15:38  WOULD BE TRANSFERRED TO THE ADJOINING OWNER WHICH
19:15:42  HAPPENS TO BE  SUNHILT
19:15:45  SUN
19:15:48  SUNHILL.
AS PART OF THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT THEY ARE GOING TO BE COMBINING THAT
19:15:51  LAND TO THEIR OWN PARCELS FOR FUTURE REDEVELOPMENT
19:15:55  WITH BUILDINGS ALONG CAPITOL AVENUE.
SO THAT IS THE PLAN AND THAT
19:15:58  WOULD BE CONSISTENT WITH THE DOWNTOWN COMMUNITY PLAN WHICH WE HAVE
19:16:01  NEW BUILDINGS LINING OUR NEW MAIN STREET, CAPITOL AVENUE.

19:16:06 >> Commissioner Liu:   OKAY, THANK YOU.
>> Commissioner Daulton:  
19:16:09  CHAIR RECOGNIZES COMMISSIONER YEE.

19:16:13 >> Commissioner Yee:   THANK YOU CHAIR.
YES,
19:16:16  I LIKE COURTNEY SAID I NOTICED THAT THERE IS ALREADY
19:16:19  TWO CUTOUTS THERE ALREADY.
ONE OF THEM THAT'S ACTUALLY
19:16:22  USABLE AND THE OTHER ONE IT LOOKS LIKE YOU HAVE TO TAKE
19:16:25  A IMPAIRIER OUT IN ORDER FOR A CAR TO GO IN
19:16:28  AND OUT.
I'M GUESSING THE ADDITIONAL CUTOUT
19:16:32 S ARE NECESSARY FOR INGRESS AND EGRESS FOR
19:16:35  FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF THAT PROPERTY.

19:16:40 >> THE
19:16:44  FEATURE, AND THIS IS PART OF THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT.
19:16:49 
THE ISSUE WAS, IT
19:16:52  REDUCED THE AMOUNT OF ACCESS TO THE SUNHILL PROPERTY
19:16:55 .
PREVIOUSLY, THERE WAS THE FORMER
19:16:59  CITIBANK PROPERTY WHICH HAD  PARKING AS WELL AS ANOTHER
19:17:02  PARCEL THAT WAS DEVELOPED AS
19:17:06  THE LOCALE PROJECT THE MIXED
19:17:09  USE PROJECT THE CITY OWNED, THERE WAS
SHARED PARKING SURFACE 
19:17:12  PARKING AREAS AS WELL AS DRIVE AISLES.
SO WHEN
19:17:15  WE EXTENDED CAPITOL AVENUE THAT WENT AWAY.
AND SO THEY WOULD
19:17:19  LIKE TO GET GREATER ACCESS TO THEIR SITE BACK.
AND SO AS
19:17:22  PART OF THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT THERE IS TWO ACCESS POINTS THAT ARE
19:17:25  BEFORE YOU.
AND THESE AMENDMENTS ARE NEEDED
19:17:28  TO EFFECTUATE
19:17:32  THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT THAT WAS AUTHORIZED BY THE CITY COUNCIL
19:17:35 .
>> Commissioner Yee:   I GUESS THAT LEADS ME TO MY SECOND QUESTION THAT IF
19:17:39  THE COMMISSION DECIDED NOT TO GO AND RECOMMEND THIS THEN
19:17:42  THE CITY WOULD HAVE TO GO INTO, I GUESS IT
19:17:45  WOULD BE  SUNHILL
WOULD BE LOOKING TO SUE THE CITY AGAIN
19:17:49 ?
>> WELL, IF THE PLANNING COMMISSION DECIDE NOT TO RECOMMEND
19:17:52  THE AMENDMENT,
19:17:56  LIKELY IT WOULD FORCE
19:18:00  STAFF TO APPEAL TO THE CITY COUNCIL.
CITY COUNCIL
19:18:03  WOULD CONSIDER THAT APPEAL.
THIS IS A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT THAT HAS BEEN
19:18:06  AUTHORIZED BY THE CITY COUNCIL.
19:18:09 
IT WOULD BE DETRIMENTAL TO THE
19:18:13  CITY IF WE'RE --
>> Commissioner Yee:   THAT'S WHAT I MEANT
19:18:16 .
DETRIMENTAL TO THE CITY.
OKAY, ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU
19:18:19 .
>> Commissioner Daulton:   CHAIR
19:18:22  RECOGNIZES COMMISSIONER ZHANG.
>> Commissioner Zhang:   THANK YOU CHAIR.

19:18:25 ACTUALLY I WAS ASKING THE SAME QUESTION.
WHAT IF WE
19:18:29  DENY THIS APPROVAL.
THANKS FOR ANSWER.
I
19:18:32  ALSO HAVE DIFFICULTY TO UNDERSTAND
19:18:35  THIS TWO PARCEL, BECAUSE I DON'T UNDERSTAND
19:18:38  THIS COORDINATE, IS THIS ALONG WITH THE WALL
19:18:42  OR ON THAT CURB OR --
>> IT IS BEHIND THE WALL
19:18:46 , COMMISSIONER ZHANG.
SO IT'S AN AREA THAT IF YOU'VE BEEN TO THE
19:18:49  SITE, WE'VE SINCE ADDED A CYCLONE
19:18:52  FENCE.
BECAUSE WE HAD LITTERING ISSUES
19:18:56  AND LOITERING.
AND SO IT'S FENCED
19:18:59  OFF, SO THAT IS THE AREA THAT WOULD BE TRANSFERRED
19:19:03  TO THE SUNHILL PROPERTY OWNERS AND IT IS IN OUR
19:19:06  BEST INTEREST TO TRANSFER IT.
LIKE I MENTIONED IT IS
19:19:09   UNBUILDABLE AS IT STANDS.
IT IS
19:19:13  EXCESS RIGHT-OF-WAY THAT WAS LEFT OVER FROM THE CAPITOL
19:19:16  AVENUE EXTENSION PROJECT THAT HAS NOW BEEN COMPLETED.

19:19:23 >> Commissioner Zhang:   I SEE.
SO WHEN THEY STARTED THIS CURB
19:19:26  CUT, WHAT HAPPENED TO THIS  PARKING
19:19:30  SPACE?
>> THERE IS GOING TO BE A FEW
19:19:33  PARKING SOMEPLACES THAT WILL BE DISPLAC
19:19:36  PARKING PLACES THAT
19:19:39  WOULD BE DISPLACED BUT THE PARKING WOULD BE INSTALLED BY
19:19:42  SUNHILT AND WE NEEDED TO GO THROUGH
19:19:45  SUNHILL
19:19:48  AND
WE NEEDED TO GO THROUGH THIS AMENDMENT PROCESS TO
19:19:52  FACILITATE.
>> Commissioner Zhang:  
19:19:55  THEY'RE GOING TO PAY FOR THIS.
THANK
19:19:57  YOU.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM COMMISSIONERS?

19:20:00 I GUESS I COULD ASK A QUESTION.
COULD YOU
19:20:03  CLIFF TELL THE PUBLIC WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO THE DECORATIVE
19:20:07  FENCE?
>> YES, THE DECORATIVE FENCE
19:20:10  ACTUALLY WAS JUST A TEMPORARY FENCE.
IT WAS ERECT
19:20:14 ED BY THE CITY AS PART OF THE CAPITOL
19:20:17  AVENUE EXTENSION PROJECT
19:20:20 .
IN ORDER TO MAKE OUR NEW MAIN STREET
19:20:23  WELCOMING, INVITING, AND ALSO SCREEN THE PARKING LOT WHICH
19:20:27  IS ACTUALLY REQUIRED BY OUR CODE.
WHEN WE EXTEND
19:20:30 ED CAPITOL AVENUE IT RESULTED IN A NEW MAIN STREET
19:20:33  BACKING UP TO THE REAR PARKING LOT OF
19:20:36  FREMONT PLAZA.
AND SO OVER TIME
19:20:40 , EXCEPT FOR THE PORTIONS THAT WE AGREED TO OPEN UP
19:20:43  SOONER, TO ALLOW FOR TWO NEW DRIVEWAY
19:20:48  INGRESS-EGRESS POINTS, WHEN SUNHILL DECIDES TO
19:20:51  DEVELOP THEIR PROPERTY, IN ACCORDANCE WITH OUR
19:20:55 
DOWNTOWN COMMUNITY  PLAN, THOSE WALL SECTIONS WOULD BE REMOVED.

19:20:59 >> Commissioner Daulton:   OKAY.
AND LAST QUESTION,
19:21:02  IN YOUR OPINION, WILL THIS
19:21:07  CHANGE, DEGRADE OR INTERFERE IN ANY WAY
19:21:10  WITH THE PLANNED PEDESTRIAN ENVIRONMENT
19:21:14  THAT'S ON CAPITOL AVENUE SET OUT BY THE DOWNTOWN
19:21:17  COMMUNITY PLAN?
>> I DON'T BELIEVE SO
19:21:20 .
THERE IS TWO DRIVEWAYS THAT WILL BE ADDED.

19:21:23 BUT ONE DRIVEWAY IS CONDITIONED UPON IF THEY DO
19:21:26  REDEVELOP THEIR SITE THEY HAVE TO CLOSE IT.
AND SO THE ONLY
19:21:29  DRIVEWAY THAT WOULD REMAIN IS A DRIVEWAY CLOSER TO
19:21:33  THE -- ACROSS FROM FREMONT BANK CLOSE
19:21:36 ER TO THE FREMONT BOULEVARD
19:21:40 -CAPITOL INTERSECTION.
AND SO IT STILL MAINTAINS THAT
19:21:43  PEDESTRIAN-FRIENDLY ENVIRONMENT.
WE'RE ONLY TALKING ABOUT ONE DRIVEWAY
19:21:47  AND SO WE'VE LOOKED AT THAT.
AND SO IT'S
19:21:50  GOING TO BE DESIGNED BY STAFF TO
19:21:54  ENSURE SAFETY OF PEDESTRIANS.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   OKAY.
ANY
19:21:57  OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMISSIONERS?
IN THAT CASE I WOULD LIKE
19:22:00  TO AT THIS TIME INVITE PUBLIC COMMENT ON THIS AGENDA ITEM IF WE HAVE
19:22:03  ANY.
TRISH DO WE HAVE ANY SPEAKERS?
19:22:07 
>> CHAIRPERSON DAULTON WE DO NOT HAVE ANY SPEAKERS
19:22:09 .
>> Commissioner Daulton:   WELL, THAT IS CONVENIENT.

19:22:12 SO I WILL CLOSE THE PUBLIC HEARING THEN
19:22:15 .
AND AT THIS POINT, BARRING ANY
19:22:20  FURTHER COMMENT, FROM THE COMMISSIONERS OR
19:22:23  QUESTIONS OF THE STAFF, I THINK WE CAN ASK FOR A
19:22:26  MOTION.
DO I HAVE ANY MORE COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS
19:22:30 ?
SO COMMISSIONER ZHANG
19:22:34 .
>> Commissioner Zhang:   JUST WANTED TO
19:22:37  HAVE GENERAL COMMENTS.
IT WOULD BE REALLY HELPFUL IF THE
19:22:41  STAFF PRESENTATION INCLUDED IN
19:22:44  THIS PROPOSAL, I HAVE
19:22:47  DIFFICULTY TO UNDERSTAND WHERE THE CURB CUT IS GOING TO BE
19:22:51 .
AND ESPECIALLY VISUALIZE WHERE, THERE IS
19:22:54  A DIAGRAM IN THE PRESENTATION IT WOULD BE REALLY HELPFUL
19:22:58  TO HELP ME UNDERSTAND THAT.
AND IT WOULD BE NICE
19:23:01  THAT IF IT WAS INCLUDED BEFORE.

19:23:04 THANK YOU.

19:23:07 >> Commissioner Daulton:   COMMISSIONER YEE.
>> Commissioner Yee:   I WAS JUST 
19:23:11 GOING TO MAKE A MOTION TO ACCEPT STAFF RECOMMENDATION.

19:23:15 >> Commissioner Daulton:   DO I HAVE A SECOND
19:23:18 ?
>> Commissioner Liu:   I SECOND.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   WE HAVE A 
19:23:22 MOTION AND SECOND.
JOEL WILL YOU CALL THE VOTE ON THIS
19:23:25  ITEM WP.
>> Planner Pullen:   YES CHAIR.
SO WHEN I CALL YOUR NAME ON A
19:23:28  MOTION BY AND CAN YOU STATE WHO MADE THE MOTION AND SECONDED AGAIN
19:23:31 ?
>> Commissioner Daulton:   YES, THAT WAS A MOTION BY COMMISSIONER YEE,

>> Planner Pullen:  
19:23:38  ALL RIGHT, ON MOTION BY COMMISSIONER YEE, SECONDED BY

19:24:17  MAY 3rd, COURTNEY?
THANK YOU.
>> THAT'S CORRECT.

19:24:22 >> Commissioner Daulton:   ALL RIGHT.
WELL, THAT WAS OUR ONLY AGENDA ITEM
19:24:26  SO LET'S MOVE ON TO MISCELLANEOUS ITEMS
19:24:29 .
>> Planner Pullen:   ACTUALLY, CHAIR, THERE IS AN ITEM THAT'S
19:24:32  UNDER 5-1, DISCUSSION ITEMS, BECAUSE OF THE
19:24:36  WAY IT WAS  FORMATTED IT SHOWED UP A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY
19:24:39  ON YOUR AGENDA.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   I  SEE, OKAY.

19:24:42 >> Planner Pullen:   I CAN GO AHEAD AND INTRODUCE THAT IF YOU LIKE.
19:24:45 
>> Commissioner Daulton:   PLEASE.
>> Planner Pullen:   SO THIS ITEM IS
19:24:48  A DISCUSSION ITEM.
THERE IS NO ACTION RECOMMENDED
19:24:51  BY YOU TONIGHT.
IT'S TO HAVE A PRESENTATION ON
19:24:55  THE 2023 THROUGH 2031 HOUSING
19:24:58  ELEMENT UPDATE.
THIS PRESENTATION IS
19:25:02  BY PRINCIPAL PLANNER AND LONG RANGE
19:25:05  LEAD WAYLAND LI AND ASSOCIATE PLANNER
19:25:09  COURTNEY PAL.

19:25:21 >> THANKS JOEL.
THE ITEM BEFORE YOU IS A PRESENTATION ON
19:25:24  THE CITY'S  2023-20
19:25:28 31 HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATE WHICH IS A PLAN TO MEET
19:25:31  THE HOUSING NEEDS OF EVERYONE IN THE FREMONT COMMUNITY OVER THE
19:25:34  NEXT EIGHT YEARS.

19:25:38 HOW WE PLAN FOR HOUSING IN FREMONT IS A BROAD TOPIC
19:25:43  INVOLVING ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, AND EQUITY
19:25:47  ISSUES THAT'S BIGGER THAN CITY OF FREMONT, MEANING THAT IT'S
19:25:50  NOT JUST A LOCAL ISSUE, BUT IT'S ALSO A REGIONAL
19:25:53 
ISSUE AND IT'S A STATEWIDE ISSUE.
IT'S AN ISSUE FOR ALL.

19:25:58 AS YOU MAY KNOW, WE, AS
19:26:01  A CITY, LAST UPDATED OUR GENERAL PLAN
19:26:05  IN 2011, WITH A VISION
19:26:08  OF BEING SUSTAINABLE, STRATEGICALLY  URBAN, INCLUSIVE
19:26:11 , DIVERSE, ECONOMICALLY SUCCESSFUL,
19:26:15   VIBRANT, IN
A WELL DESIGNED
19:26:18   CITY.
A MODEL OF HOW AN
19:26:22  AUTOORIENTED SUBURB CAN EVOLVE TO A  SUSTAINABLE
19:26:26  STRATEGICALLY URBAN AND MODERN CITY.
AND
19:26:29  HOUSING IS A FOUNDATIONAL PIECE 
19:26:32 THAT UNDERPINS ALL OF THOSE THINGS.
AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HERE TO
19:26:35  TALK ABOUT TONIGHT.
HOUSE DO WE PUT A POLICY FRAMEWORK
19:26:38  IN PLACE THAT
19:26:42  ENSURES EVERYONE IN THE COMMUNITY HAS ACCESS TO SAFE AND AFFORDABLE
19:26:45  HOUSING.
THAT SUPPORTS ALL OF THOSE VARIOUS
19:26:48  GOALS IN THE CITY'S GENERAL PLAN.

19:26:52 THIS SPRING WE'VE BEEN GETTING OUT TO STAKEHOLDERS TO EXPLAIN
19:26:55  THE HOUSING ELEMENT PROCESS AND TO ENGAGE
19:26:58  OUR PEOPLE.
WE VISITED A NUMBER OF OTHER
19:27:02  BOARDS AND COMMITTEES SO FAR, INCLUDING THE
19:27:05  HUMAN RELATIONS COMMISSION AND THE CV
19:27:08 BG ADVISORY COMMITTEE.
WE'VE ALSO PRESENTED
19:27:12  TO THE CITY COUNCIL AND TO THE SCHOOL BOARD, AND COMING UP WE'LL
19:27:15  BE TALKING WITH THE SENIOR ADVISORY AND THE
19:27:19  YOUTH ADVISORY COMMISSIONS.

19:27:24 EVERY COMMISSION THAT WE'VE TALKED WITH HAS HAD ITS
19:27:27  OWN FOCUS OR ITS OWN MANDATE.
AND
19:27:30  WE TRIED TO MAKE THAT CONNECTION BRIMMING THEIR
19:27:33  WORK WITH THE HOUSING UPDATE EFFORT.
BUT FOR
19:27:36  YOU AS A PLANNING COMMISSION THERE'S A MORE CLEAR AND OBVIOUS
19:27:39  CONNECTION.
JUST RECENTLY, YOU CONSIDERED A
19:27:42  MIXED USE DEVELOPMENT PROMOTE IN DECOTO
19:27:46 , YOU CONSIDERED A DRAFT AFFORDABLE
19:27:49  HOUSING ORDINANCE UPDATE, YOU CONSIDERED A
19:27:52  SCREENING REQUEST TO AMEND THE LAND USE
19:27:57 
DESIGNATION TO ONE THAT WOULD POTENTIALLY ALLOW HOUSING.

19:28:00 YOU MAKE A LOT OF DECISIONS THAT INVOLVE HOUSING.

19:28:03 AND NOW, AS WE ENDEAVOR
19:28:07  TO UPDATE OUR HOUSING ELEMENT, YOU WILL HAVE AN
19:28:10  OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE A STEP BACK AND
19:28:13  LOOK FOR BROADLY AT THE POLICY
19:28:16  FRAMEWORK THAT IS LARGELY THE BASIS OF HOW YOU
19:28:19  DO YOUR WORK
AS A PLANNING COMMISSION.
19:28:23 ER.
SO OUR PRESENTATION
19:28:26  THIS EVENING WILL COVER A FEW THINGS.
INCLUDING
19:28:30  THE BASICS ABOUT HOUSING ELEMENT, INCLUDING THE
19:28:35  RELEVANT LEGAL FRAMEWORK, WE'LL DISCUSS THE ON
19:28:38 GOING HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATE AND THE WORK
19:28:41  IN FRONT OF US.
WE'LL FOCUS ON THE
19:28:44  SITES INVENTORY, FAIR HOUSING AND THE
19:28:47  POLICY FRAMEWORK OF THE HOUSING ELEMENT.
AND THIN AT THE CONCLUSION OF
19:28:50  THE PRESENTATION WE'LL WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU WITH
19:28:53  ANY QUESTIONS OR THOUGHTS THAT YOU MAY
19:28:57  HAVE ON THE TOPIC.
OUR GOAL TONIGHT IS TO GIVE YOU A
19:29:00  BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE HOUSING ELEMENT PROCESS, ANSWER
19:29:03  QUESTIONS, RECEIVE INPUT, TO
19:29:07  HELP SET THE STAGE FOR A DISCUSSION ABOUT HOUSING NEEDS AND CONSTRAINTS
19:29:10 , AND
THE APPROPRIATE POLICY RESPONSES LATER ON.

19:29:22 NOW UNDER STATE LAW CITIES AND COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA REQUIRE TO PLAN
19:29:25  FOR THE HOUSING NEEDS OF EVERYONE IN THE COMMUNITY BY INCLUDING
19:29:28  A HOUSING ELEMENT AS ONE OF THE SEARCH MANDATORY
19:29:31  ELEMENTS OF A
GENERAL PLAN.
I'D LIKE TO CALL THE
19:29:34  CITY'S GENERAL PLAN THE CITY'S CONSTITUTION
19:29:38  FOR GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT.
19:29:41 
IT SERVES AS THE POLICY FOUNDATION UPON WHICH DEVELOPMENT AND LAND
19:29:44  USE DECISIONS SHOULD BE BASED.

19:29:48 THIS HOUSING ELEMENT IS A CHAPTER OF THE GENERAL PLAN
19:29:52 , THAT SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSES A COMMUNITY'S HOUSING NEEDS
19:29:55 .

19:29:58 IT'S DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHER ELEMENTS OF THE GENERAL PLAN IN THAT IT'S
19:30:01  REQUIRED TO BE UPDATED EVERY EIGHT YEARS.
AND
19:30:04  IT'S SUBJECT TO REVIEW AND APPROVAL BY THE STATE'S HOUSING
19:30:08  AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT.
THE STATE
19:30:11  HAS DETERMINED THAT THE CREATION OF HOUSING IS A MATTER OF
19:30:15  STATEWIDE IMPORTANCE.
AND THE NEED
19:30:18  FOR SAFE AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING CROSSES
19:30:21  BOTH LOCAL AROUND REGIONAL JURISDICTION
19:30:24 AL LINES.

19:30:28  AND
19:30:31  REGIONAL LINES.
AT ALL
19:30:35  INCOME LEVELS TO MEET THE COMMUNITY'S NEEDS.
THE HOUSING ELEMENT
19:30:38  IS ALSO REQUIRED TO DEMONSTRATE TO HCD
19:30:41  THAT THE JURISDICTION HAS CAPACITY
19:30:44  TO ACCOMMODATE A SHARE OF THE
19:30:47  REGIONAL'S HOUSING NEEDS WHICH IS KNOWN AS THE REGIONAL
19:30:51  HOUSING NEEDS
ALLOCATION
19:30:54  OR  RHNA.
19:30:57 
IF COST NOT ADDRESS ITS HOUSING NEED, THE
19:31:03  CONSEQUENCES CAN BE SEVERE, INCLUDING LOSS OF
19:31:06  CONTROL AND POTENTIAL FINANCIAL PENALTIES.

19:31:14 THE CITY'S CURRENT HOUSING ELEMENT COVERS THE
19:31:17  PERIOD BETWEEN 2015 AND 2023 AND DURING THIS
19:31:20  PERIOD THE CITY WAS ASSIGNED
19:31:23  A RHNA OF
19:31:26  5445 TOTAL DWELLING UNITS.
THE RHNA IS
19:31:29  BROKEN DOWN FURTHER BY INCOME LEVEL.
AS YOU CAN SEE MORE
19:31:32  THAN HALF OF OUR CURRENT ALLOCATION IS
19:31:36  FOR LOWER INCOME HOUSING.
THIS TYPE OF HOUSING
19:31:39  IS TYPICALLY DEVELOPED BY NON
19:31:43 PROFIT AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS, USING FUNDING FROM THE STATE
19:31:46  OR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS, OR BY
19:31:49  PRIVATE DEVELOPERS WHO INCLUDE AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS
19:31:53 
WITHIN A MARKET RATE PROJECT TO SATISFY THE CITY'S AFFORDABLE HOUSING
19:31:56  ORDINANCE.

19:32:00 THE
19:32:03  CITY'S RHNA DICTATES THE AMOUNT OF HOUSING THAT WE MUST HAVE TO ACCOMMODATE
19:32:07 .
OFTENTIMES DUE TO MARKET FORCES THAT MAY BE
19:32:10  OUTSIDE THE CITY'S CONTROL, THE AMOUNT
19:32:14  AND AFFORDABILITY OF HOUSING, OF HOUSING THAT'S ACTUALLY
19:32:17  PRODUCED DURING A PLANNING CYCLE, CAN BE
19:32:20  VERY DIFFERENT FROM
A RHNA ALLOCATION.
19:32:23 
SO TAKING A LOOK AT THE SLIDE AS CAN YOU SEE ON THE RIGHT
19:32:30  YOU CAN SEE TON RIGHT WHILE THE CITY HAS PRODUCED MORE THAN
19:32:34  ITS RHNA ALLOCATION DURING THE CURRENT PLANNING PERIOD,
19:32:37  THE AFFORDABILITY
OF THOSE UNITS IS NOT APPORTION
19:32:40  AT TO THOSE CATEGORIES.
MORE ABOVE MODERATE
19:32:44  THAN WAS PRODUCED IN THE MODERATE AND VERY
19:32:48  LOW MODERATE INCOME CATEGORIES.
NOW THAT
19:32:51  WE'VE REVIEWED OUR CURRENT RHNA, I'D LIKE TO MOVE
19:32:54  ON TO DISCUSS OUR RHNA IN THE
19:32:57   UPCOMING HOUSING ELEMENT CYCLE.
STATE LAW REQUIRES
19:33:00  THAT EACH JURISDICTION PLAN FOR ITS
19:33:03  FAIR SHARE OF REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS.
THE
19:33:06  PROCESS OF DETERMINING FAIR
19:33:10  SHARE ALLOCATIONS BEGINS WITH THE STATE
19:33:13  WHO ISSUES A REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS DETERMINATION
19:33:16  TO THE REGIONAL COUNCIL OF GOVERNMENTS WHICH FOR THE
19:33:20  SAN FRANCISCO
BAY AREA IS THE ASSOCIATION OF BAY AREA GOVERNMENTS
19:33:23  OR ABAG.
FOR THE 2023 TO 20
19:33:26 31 CYCLE,  ABAG'S REGIONAL HOUSING
19:33:30  DETERMINATIONS FOR 4
19:33:33 41,176  UNITS.

19:33:38 AFTER RECEIVING THIS DETERMINATION FROM THE STATE
19:33:41 , ABAG THEN DETERMINES THE ALLOCATIONS
19:33:45  FOR SPECIFIC LOCAL JURISDICTIONS WITHIN THEIR REGION.

19:33:49 ABAG DETERMINED THEIR  ALLOCATIONS
19:33:52  THROUGH A RHNA METHODOLOGY
19:33:56  WHICH INCLUDED THREE UNITS, BASIC
19:33:59  ELABORATION FACTORS AND EQUITY ADJUSTMENT.
AND THROUGH
19:34:02  THAT METHODOLOGY THAT RESULTED IN A RHNA ALLOCATION
19:34:06  OF 12,897 UNITS FOR
19:34:09  THE CITY OF FREMONT FOR THE  2023-2031
19:34:12  HOUSING ELEMENT CYCLE.
THIS IS FREMONT'S HOUSING
19:34:15  NEED DURING THIS PERIOD.
AND WE MUST NOW
19:34:20  HAVE ZONING AND THE POLICIES IN PLACE TO ALLOW
19:34:23  FOR THIS LEVEL OF PRODUCTION WITHIN OUR HOUSING
19:34:26  ELEMENT UPDATE DURING THIS PERIOD.

19:34:29 NOW WE'RE NOT PHYSICALLY BUILDING THOSE UNITS
19:34:33  BUT OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE THE
19:34:36  ZONING IN PLACE.
AND THAT WE HAVE --
19:34:39  WE HAVE TAKEN AWAY THE CONSTRAINTS TO ALLOW THAT
19:34:42  HOUSING TO BE BUILT.
19:34:50 
THIS SLIDE SHOWS A COMPARISON OF BOTH THE REGIONAL
19:34:53  AND LOCAL HOUSING NEEDS FROM THE PAST 20
19:34:56 15 TO 2023 HOUSING ELEMENT CYCLE AND THE
19:34:59  UPCOMING 2023 TO 2031 HOUSING
19:35:02  ELEMENT CYCLE.
AS YOU CAN SEE, BOTH
19:35:06  THE REGIONAL AND THE LOCAL ALLOCATIONS INCREASE
19:35:10 ED SUBSTANTIALLY FROM THE LAST CYCLE AND
19:35:13  THIS REFLECTS THE  ONGOING REGIONAL
19:35:16  HOUSING SHORTAGE AND PARTICULARLY THE SHORTAGE OF
HOUSING AT
19:35:19  AFFORDABLE RENTS AND PRICE FOR THOSE WITH THE LOWER INCOMES
19:35:22 .
CITIES AROUND THE REGION HAVE
19:35:26  ALMOST UNIVERSALLY SEEN SIMILAR
19:35:29  LARGE INCREASES IN THEIR ALLOCATIONS.
THIS
19:35:32  SLIDE SHOWS THE BREAKDOWN OF THE CITY'S
19:35:35  UPCOMING RHNA BY INCOME LEVEL.
YOU'LL NOTICE
19:35:39  THAT THE RELATIVELY SHARED HOUSING AT
19:35:42  EACH INCOME LEVEL HAS REMAINED RELATIVELY CONSISTENT WITH
19:35:46  THE LAST CYCLE.
EVEN THOUGH
19:35:49  OUR ALLOCATION OVERALL HAS INCREASED.

19:35:54 NOW, WITH THAT I'LL HAND THE PRESENTATION OFF TO
19:35:57  COURTNEY PAL WHO WILL DISCUSS THE COMPONENTS OF THE 20
19:36:00 23 TO 2031 HOUSING ELEMENTS.

19:36:04 >> THANKS WAYLAND.
THE HOUSING
19:36:07  ELEMENT MUST DEMONSTRATE THE CITY'S ABILITY TO MEET OUR ASSIGNED
19:36:12  RHNA THROUGH BOTH THE IDENTIFICATION OF SITES WITH ADEQUATE ZONING TO
19:36:15  ACCOMMODATE PRODUCTION, AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF
POLICIES
19:36:18  THAT REMOVE BARRIERS TO HOUSING AS WAYLAND
19:36:22  PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED.
AND THIS SLIDE SHOWS YOU THE
19:36:25  PRIMARY COMPONENTS OF OUR HOUSING ELEMENT
19:36:28  THAT THAT HOUSING ELEMENT
19:36:32  MUST STATUTORILY CONTAIN.
19:36:35 
THE FIRST ROW SHOWS DIFFERENT TYPES OF ANALYSIS THAT
19:36:38  WE MUST PERFORM.
THE FIRST COMPONENT IS AN
19:36:41  EVALUATION OF THE PREVIOUS HOUSING ELEMENT WHICH WILL
19:36:44  COMPARE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT WAS PROJECTED, OR
19:36:47  PLANNED, AND THE
19:36:51  PREVIOUSLY HOUSING ELEMENT CYCLES AND WHAT WAS
19:36:54 
ACTUALLY ACHIEVED.
THE SECOND COMPONENT IS AN
19:36:57  ANALYSIS OF COMMUNITY HOUSING NEEDS.
THIS SECTION WILL LOOK AT
19:37:00  A DEMOGRAPHIC PROFILE OF THE COMMUNITY AS WELL AS A PROFILE OF
19:37:03  OUR CURRENT HOUSING STOCK.
IT WILL ALSO ANALYZE
19:37:07  THE HOUSING NEEDS OF SPECIAL POPULATIONS WITH
19:37:10  UNIQUE HOUSING NEEDS IN OUR COMMUNITY
19:37:13  INCLUDING PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES, SENIORS, AND  UNHOUSED PEOPLE
19:37:16 .
THE THIRD COMPONENT IS
19:37:19  AN ANALYSIS OF POTENTIAL CONSTRAINTS TO HOUSING PRODUCTION
19:37:23 .
THE CITY IS STATUTORILY REQUIRED
19:37:27  TO REVIEW THE IMPACT OF POLICIES ON CONSTRAINING
19:37:30  HOUSING PRODUCTION INCLUDING THINGS LIKE ZONING STANDARDS, PROCESS
19:37:33 ING PROCEDURES, FEES AND
19:37:37  EXACTIONS.
THE BOTTOM ROW ON THIS
19:37:40  SLIDE SHOWS THE DIFFERENT ACTIONABLE COMPONENTS OF
19:37:44  OUR HOUSING ELEMENT.
THESE ARE THE AREAS IN WHICH
19:37:47  THE CITY IS GOING TO NEED TO COMMIT TO
19:37:50  TAKE CERTAIN ACTION AT THE END OF THE DAY WHEN OUR HOUSING ELEMENT
19:37:53  IS CERTIFIED.
THE FOURTH COMPONENT
19:37:56  IS THE SITES INVENTORY.
AND THIS IS THE COMPONENT THAT
19:37:59  WILL PROVIDE A LIST OF SITES THAT CAN ACCOMMODATE OUR
19:38:03  REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS ALLOCATION AT DIFFERENT INCOME LEVELS.

19:38:08 THE FIFTH COMPONENT IS A LIST OF GOALS, POLICIES,
19:38:12  AND IMPLEMENTATION PROGRAMS THAT WILL CREATE A GAME PLAN FOR THE
19:38:15  HOUSING ELEMENT PLANNING PERIOD.
THE
19:38:19  FINAL COMPONENT IS
19:38:23  AFFIRMATIVELY FAIR
19:38:26  HOUSING, THIS SECTION REQUIRES
19:38:29  THE CITY TO PATTERNS
19:38:32  OF SEGREGATION AND FOSTER INCLUSIVE
19:38:35  COMMUNITIES THAT ARE FREE FROM BARRIERS THAT RESTRICT ACCESS TO
19:38:37 
OPPORTUNITY BASED ON PROTECTED CHARACTERISTICS.

19:38:43 TONIGHT, I WANT TO CONCENTRATE ON THIS BOTTOM ROW OF
19:38:47  THESE ACTIONABLE ITEMS.
TO PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL CONTEXT
19:38:50  AS TO WHAT WILL BE REQUIRED FROM THE CITY IN THE
19:38:53  HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATE.
WE WON'T BE APPROACHING OR DISCUSS
19:38:56  PROPOSING OR  DISCUSSING
19:38:59  ANY SPECIFIC POLICIES AT TONIGHT'S MEETING HOWEVER WE
19:39:03  AFTER OUR PRESENTATION WE WOULD LIKE TO HEAR FROM THE PLANNING COMMISSION
19:39:06 ERS
ABOUT ANY INITIAL THOUGHTS ABOUT HOW YOU FEEL THE
19:39:09  HOUSING ELEMENT SHOULD ADDRESS THESE COMPONENTS.
THE FIRST COMPONENT THAT I
19:39:12  WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS IS OUR SITES INVENTORY
19:39:15 .
AND DESPITE THE SIGNIFICANT INCREASE
19:39:18  IN OUR ALLOCATION, FREMONT IS IN A GOOD POSITION TO ACCOMMODATE
19:39:22  OUR RHNA ALLOCATION WITHOUT THE REZONING OF INDIVIDUAL
19:39:25  SITES FOR THE NEXT CYCLE.
AS
19:39:29  WAYLAND MENTIONED AT THE VERY BEGINNING OF
19:39:32  THE PRESENTATION THE CITY'S 2011 GENERAL PLAN WAS REALLY
19:39:35  FORWARD-THINKING AND PLANNED FOR STRATEGIC TRANSIT
19:39:39  ORIENTED DEVELOPMENTS WITHIN TOWN CENTERS,
CITY CENTERS,
19:39:42  AND DOWNTOWN, IN WAYS THAT STRATEGIC
19:39:46  STRATEGICALLY URBANIZED THE COMMUNITY AND ALLOWED FOR DENSE
19:39:49  HOUSING TO BE BUILT IN AREAS WHERE IT MADE SENSE.
THE
19:39:52  MAP SHOWN ON THIS SLIDE INDICATES OUR PRIORITY
19:39:56  DEVELOPMENT AREAS OR PDA'S WHICH ARE THE AREAS THAT ARE
19:39:59  NEAR MAJOR TRANSIT CORRIDORS THAT HAVE SIGNIFICANT CAPACITY
19:40:02  FOR HOUSING GROWTH.
STAFF BELIEVE THAT THE
19:40:05  EXISTING JIM AND ZONING LARGELY WITHIN
19:40:08  GENERAL PLAN AND ZONING LARGE
19:40:12 LY SHOWN WITHIN BLUE ON THE MAP WILL PROVIDE CAPACITY
19:40:15  TO ACCOMMODATE OUR RHNA IN OUR NEXT HOUSING
19:40:18  DEVELOPMENT
CYCLE.
IT IS IMPORTANT THAT MOST DEVELOPMENT 
19:40:22 WILL OCCUR IN  THESEFORDA AREAS RATHER THAN
19:40:25  THESE PDA
19:40:28  AREAS, BECAUSE THIS WILL HELP US MEET OUR CLIMATE
19:40:31  AND SUSTAINABILITY
19:40:34  GOALS IN
ADDITION TO OUR HOUSING GOALS.
THE SECTION COMPONENT I'D LIKE TO 
19:40:38 MENTION IS OUR GOALS, POLICIES AND PROGRAMS
19:40:41 .
WHICH SET POLICY
19:40:44  DIRECTION FOR THE CITY'S HOUSING POLICY.
19:40:47 
THE CITY'S PAST HOUSING
19:40:50  ELEMENT THAT IS EIGHT GENOMES 29 POLICIES AND
19:40:53  69 PROGRAMS.
POLICIES AND THE PROGRAMS ARE INTENDED TO IMPLEMENT
19:40:56  THE INTENTIONS
19:41:00  BEHIND EACH OF THE GOALS.
THESE ARE OBVIOUSLY A LOT OF
19:41:04  GOALS POLICIES AND PROGRAMS.
I WANTED TO BREAK IT DOWN IN
19:41:07  A WAY THAT WAS MORE DIGESTIBLE IN
19:41:10  KIND OF SHORT AND BRIEF SEGMENTS.
THE
19:41:13  MAIN INTENTIONS BEHIND EACH OF THE GOALS ARE SUMMARIZED
19:41:17  ON EACH SLIDE.
THE GOAL IS TO PRESERVE
19:41:22  EXISTING
19:41:26  HOUSING IN OUR COMMUNITY.
HABITABILITY REQUIREMENTS,
19:41:29  MONITORING AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS THAT ARE AT RISK
19:41:32  TO CONVERSION BACK TO MARKET RATE HOUSING UNITS AND CONTINUING TO
19:41:36  ENFORCE POLICIES LIKE THE CITY'S MOBILE HOME
19:41:39  RENT
STABILIZATION ORDINANCE.
GOALS 2, 3, 5 AND
19:41:42  7 CALL FOR FACILITATION OF NEW HIGH QUALITY HOUSING
19:41:45 .
WITH A PARTICULAR EMPHASIS ON
19:41:49  DEVELOPING AFFORDABLE HOUSING.
PROGRAMS THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH
19:41:52  THESE GOALS INCLUDE  PROMOTING THE DEVELOPMENT
19:41:55  OF ACCESSORY DWELLING UNITS, PROVIDING FUNDING
19:41:58  FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS THROUGH THE CITY'S
19:42:01  NOFA PROCESS
AND ADVOCATING FOR THE EXPANSION
19:42:04  OF STATE FINANCIAL RESOURCES FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING.

19:42:08 FINALLY, GOALS 4 AND 6 ARE INTENDED TO
19:42:11  PROTECT OUR MOST VULNERABLE RESIDENTS FROM DISCRIMINATION
19:42:15  AND DISPLACEMENT.
RELATED PROGRAMS ENCOURAGE THE DEVELOPMENT
19:42:19  OF SUPPORTIVE SERVICES, FOR MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY THAT ARE DISABLED
19:42:22 ,  UNHOUSED, LOW INCOME, ELDERLY OR
19:42:25  FACE OTHER CHALLENGES THAT MAKE THEM MORE
VULNERABLE.

19:42:31 FINALLY GOAL 8 WHICH IS NOT SHOWN ON THIS SLIDE CALLS FOR
19:42:34  THE MAINTENANCE OF A CERTIFIED HOUSING
19:42:37  ELEMENT AND PREPARATION OF AFTERNOON ANNUAL REPORT.
STAFF ANTICIPATE
19:42:40  THAT WHILE THE POLICIES PROGRAMS AND SPECIFIC VERBIAGE
19:42:44  WITHIN THESE PROGRAMS MAY BE UPDATED THE
19:42:47  OVERALL INTENTION AND HIGH LEVEL HOUSING GOALS WILL REMAIN THE SAME
19:42:51  IN THE CURRENT
HOUSING ELEMENT CYCLE.

19:42:54 OUR FINAL AREA OF ACTION IS OUR
19:42:59  AFFIRMATIVELY AFFIRMING FAIR HOUSING REQUIREMENTS.
AROUNDS AS
19:43:02  PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED  THIS WAS A NEW REQUIREMENT FOR THIS
19:43:06  HOUSING ELEMENT CYCLES.
IT HASN'T BEEN INCLUDED IN
19:43:09  OUR PREVIOUS HOUSING ELEMENTS AT LEAST DIRECTLY ALTHOUGH WE DO
19:43:12  HAVE POLICIES THAT SUPPORT ALL OF THESE POLICIES, WE NEED TO
19:43:15  GET MORE DIRECT ABOUT THEM AND A LOT MORE MEASURABLE
 ABOUT THEM.
19:43:18 
THIS SECTION REQUIRES US TO LOOK AT PATTERNS
19:43:22  OF SEGREGATION ON A REGIONAL AND LOCAL LEVEL
19:43:25  AND COMMIT TO SPECIFIC ACTIONS TO
19:43:28  AFFIRMATIVELY ADDRESS SEGREGATION.
WITHIN OUR
19:43:31  REGIONAL CONTEXT FREMONT CAN BE CATEGORIZE
19:43:34 ED AS AN AREA OF HIGH OPPORTUNITY.
WITHIN FREMONT ONE
19:43:37  OF THE KEY PATTERNS WITHIN THE CITY RELATES TO
19:43:40  THE DISTRIBUTION OF LOW AND MODERATE INCOME HOUSEHOLDS
19:43:43  WHICH IS SHOWN ON THIS MAP.
LOW AND MODERATE
19:43:46  INCOME HOUSEHOLDS ARE GENERALLY MORE PREVALENT WITHIN
19:43:50  THE CENTRAL AND NORTHERN AREAS OF THE CITIES AND THE
19:43:53  AREAS WEST OF MISSION BOULEVARD.YOU CAN SEE AREAS OF
19:43:57  A HIGH PERCENTAGE OF
LOW MODERATE INCOME
19:44:00  HOUSEHOLDS ARE LARGELY LOCATED AROUND
19:44:03  FREMONT  BOULEVARD.
THESE ARE ALSO DISPROPORTIONATE
19:44:06  DISPROPORTIONATELY LOCATED NEAR THE BART STATIONS
19:44:10  DOWNTOWN, THE PROPOSED BART STATION AND THE AREA
19:44:13  IN CENTERVILLE.
YOU MAY BE NOTICING THAT THIS PATTERN LOOKS LIKE
19:44:16  ANOTHER SLIDE THAT I ALREADY SHOWED TONIGHT AND THIS IS WHY THIS PATTERN
19:44:20  IS IMPORTANT TO US.
IF YOU RECALL
19:44:23  THE SLIDE THAT DISCUSSES OUR PLANNED INVENTORY,
19:44:26  MOST OF OUR PLANNED GROWTH WITHIN THE
19:44:29  NEXT CYCLE IS PLANNED WITHIN THESE SAME AREAS.
IN ORDER
19:44:32  TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF AFFIRMATIVELY FURTHERING
19:44:36  FAIR HOUSING, OUR HOUSING ELEMENT WILL ALSO NEED TO
19:44:39  TAKE SPECIFIC POLICY ACTIONS TO ENCOURAGE AFFORDABLE
19:44:43  HOUSING DEVELOPMENT WITHIN THE
WEALTHY AREAS OF THE CITY.

19:44:48 THAT CONCLUDES OUR REVIEW.
19:44:52  REVIEW OF THE THREE ACTION
19:44:56 ABLE ELEMENTS, GOING FORWARD THERE ARE GOING TO BE A
19:44:59  NUMBER OF OPPORTUNITIES OF PUBLIC PARTICIPATION IN THE PROCESS.
I
19:45:02  WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT ANY OPPORTUNITIES FOR ANY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC
19:45:05  WHO HAVE JOINED US TONIGHT.
WE'RE ENCOURAGE
19:45:08 ING THOSE WHO ARE INTERESTED IN THE PROCESS TO GO TO THE WEBSITE
19:45:12 ,  FREMONT.GOV/HOUSING ELEMENT
19:45:15  WHERE THEY CAN SIGN UP TO BE NOTIFIED OF FUTURE MEETINGS AND
19:45:19  OTHER IMPORTANT
HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATES.
IN ORDER
19:45:22  TO RECEIVE FEEDBACK FROM THE COMMUNITY WE'RE
19:45:25  ALSO OFFERING MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO SCHEDULE OFFICE HOURS WITH
19:45:29  OUR PROJECT TEAM.
RESIDENTS CAN ALSO SIGN UP FOR
19:45:32  THESE OFFICE HOURS ONLINE ON THE PROJECT
19:45:35  WEBSITE AND FIND SOME TIME TO TALK TO THE PROJECT TEAM
19:45:38  ON A ONE ON ONE BASIS ABOUT
19:45:41  YOUR IDEAS ON THE HOUSING UPDATE PROCESS.
THE WEBSITE
19:45:45  IS ALSO GOING TO BE UPDATED WITH INFORMATION REGARDING
19:45:48  UPCOMING PRESENTATIONS AS WELL AS UPDATED
19:45:51  COMMUNITY MEETINGS WHEN THOSE OCCUR.
FOR THE PLANNING COMMISSIONERS
19:45:54  I WANTED TO GIVE YOU A BIT OF AN UPDATE ABOUT OUR
19:45:57  UPCOMING SCHEDULE FOR MEETINGS AND WHEN WE'LL BE BACK IN FRONT
19:46:00  OF YOU AGAIN WITH ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITIES TO
19:46:04  COMMENT ON
THIS HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATE.
FIRST WE'LL
19:46:07  BE PRESENTING BEFORE CITY COUNCIL IN APRIL OF 2022
19:46:10  ON SOME OF THE MAJOR ISSUES WE PRESENTED
19:46:14  YOU TONIGHT.
WE ANTICIPATE HAVING A DRAFT HOUSING
19:46:17  ELEMENT FOR THE PUBLIC'S REVIEW IN JUNE OF 2022.
19:46:20 
SO ONCE THAT DRAFT IS AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC WE'LL BE RETURNING
19:46:23  TO THE PLANNING COMMISSION WITH THE DRAFT FOR ADDITIONAL
19:46:26  INPUT AND AT THAT MEETING WE'LL BE DISCUSSING SPECIFIC
19:46:30  PROGRAMS AND POLICIES
THAT WE MIGHT CONSIDER ADOPTING FOR THE UP
19:46:33 COMING SIGNING.
NOTABLY AND THIS IS THE BIG DATE
19:46:36  DATE, OUR FINAL 2023 THROUGH 20
19:46:39  2031 HOUSING ELEMENT MUST BE ADOPTED BY
19:46:43  JANUARY 31st, 2023, IN ORDER TO ALLOW SUFFICIENT TIME
19:46:47  FOR HCD CERTIFICATION BEFORE THE
STATUTORY
19:46:50  DEADLINE.
SO THAT CONCLUDES OUR
19:46:54  PRESENTATION THIS EVENING.
WE'RE NOW AVAILABLE FOR ANY QUESTIONS
19:46:57  OR COMMENTS YOU MAY HAVE, AS WAY
19:47:00 LAND MENTIONED AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PRESENTATION WE'RE REALLY YOU
19:47:03  KNOW THIS IS YOUR OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE WITH US YOUR THOUGHTS
AND
19:47:06  FEEDBACK OFF WHERE WE SHOULD BE COMBING THIS
19:47:09  SCOPING THIS FUTURE
19:47:13  HOUSING UPDATE SO WE CAN UNDERSTAND YOUR INTEREST AND HOW YOU
19:47:16  WOULD APPROACH SOFERLG THESE HOUSING
19:47:19  ISSUES THAT YOU VERY OFTEN
CONSIDER HERE ON THE PLANNING COMMISSION SO WITH
19:47:22  THAT WE'LL WRAP IT UP AND TURN IT
19:47:26  BACK TO YOU CHAIR DAULTON.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   THANK YOU, COURTNEY
19:47:29 .
COMMISSIONERS, DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS
19:47:34 ?
19:47:35 
ANYONE?
COMMISSIONER YEE.

19:47:40 >> Commissioner Yee:   I WANT TO FIRST THANK COURTNEY FOR
19:47:43  SUCH A COMPLETE PRESENTATION.
THAT MADE IT MUCH CLEARER I
19:47:46  THINK NOT ONLY FOR ME, BUT ALSO FOR THE GENERAL PUBLIC.
19:47:49 
BECAUSE I THINK ONE OF THE QUESTIONS IS, WHERE IS
19:47:52  ALL OF THIS GOING TO BE.
19:47:56 
YOU KNOW, AND IT DOES MAKE SENSE TO HAVE IT, YOU KNOW,
19:47:59  ALONG THIS TRANSIT CORRIDOR.
I GUESS ONE OF THE THINGS
19:48:02  I'M JUST WONDERING ABOUT TOO, IT'S KIND
19:48:06  OF -- I GUESS PART OF THE PLAN IS PROBABLY REPURPOSING SOME OF
19:48:10  THESE SITES, KIND OF LIKE WHAT'S GOING ON RIGHT NOW
19:48:14  WITH THE
DISCUSSION FOR THE FUNDING FOR THE MOTEL
19:48:17  6 PROJECT THAT'S OVER THERE TO TRY TO REPURPOSE IT
19:48:21  INTO SOMETHING THAT CAN ACTUALLY REACH OUR VERY LOW AND
19:48:24  LOW INCOME HOUSING RHNA NUMBERS.
19:48:27 
AND BASED ON THE NUMBERS THAT I SEE, IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S
19:48:31  ABOUT  2.4 TIMES MORE THAN
19:48:35  THE PREVIOUS CYCLE.
SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE
19:48:38  PUBLIC HEARS THAT.
BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THERE'S
19:48:41  BEEN DISCUSSION FROM THE PUBLIC
19:48:45 , QUESTIONING ABOUT ALL THIS HOUSING THAT'S BEING BUILT AND THEY
19:48:49  COULD SEE THAT THIS NEXT CYCLE BEGINNING IN 2023
19:48:52  IS GOING TO BE A
19:48:55  ALMOST 2.3
TO 2.4 INCREASE IN
19:48:58  TERMS OF THAT RHNA NUMBER.
AND HOW DO WE DO THIS
19:49:01  PROPERLY SO THAT WHETHER IT'S REPURPOSING TO AD
19:49:04 U'S, TO I GUESS NOW YOU KNOW
19:49:07  WE JUST CAME BACK
19:49:11  WITH A -- A NUMBER OF US
19:49:14  CAME BACK WITH IMPLEMENTATION OF
19:49:19  SB 9
[ DISTORT
19:49:22 ED ] HOW DOES THIS ALL I DO KNOW AFTER SPEAKING
19:49:25  WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE KIND OF SHOCKED BY THIS
19:49:29  ALMOST 13,000 NUMBER.
I KNOW
19:49:32  THAT ORIGINALLY, THE CITY WAS BEING ASKED
19:49:35  TO BE GOING IN EXCESS OF 16,000.
SO
19:49:38  SHE WAS ABLE TO FIGHT TO BRING THE NUMBER DOWN TO SOMETHING, I
19:49:42  GUESS, A LITTLE BIT MORE MANAGEABLE
19:49:45 .
IS KIND OF HOW I'LL SAY IT.

19:49:55 SO THAT'S MORE OF A COMMENT.
>> WE'LL TAKE THAT AS A
19:49:58  COMMENT.
>> Planner Pullen:   IT WAS A WIDE RANGING COMMENT AND
19:50:02  YOUR SOURCE IS A LITTLE BIT CUTTING OUT.
>> Commissioner Yee:   I'M  SORRY,
19:50:05  YES.
>> Commissioner Daulton:  
19:50:08  COMMISSIONER ZHANG.

19:50:12 >> Commissioner Zhang:   SIMILAR QUESTION.
WE JUST
19:50:15  LEARNED THAT SB
19:50:19  9 FOR ASSIMILATING
19:50:22  THEIR LOTS AND SB 35 AND 330 TO STREAMLINE
19:50:26  THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPMENT
19:50:29 .
SOMETIMES EXEMPT CEQA.
19:50:33 
DOES FREMONT ADOPT THOSE PLAN, LIKE
19:50:36  DO WE HAVE A PLAN FOR  ADOPTING SB
19:50:39  9 AND THOSE STREAM
19:50:44  LINED PARCELS?
>> WELL, I'LL PEEK TO SB
19:50:47  9  FIRST.
THE STATE ADOPTED SB
19:50:50  9 LAST  FALL.
AND BECAME EFFECTIVE
19:50:54  JANUARY 1 OF THIS YEAR .
SO THE
19:50:57  LAW IS IN EFFECT.
IF SOMEONE WANTED
19:51:01  TO -- SOMEONE WANTED TO APPLY UNDER
19:51:04  SB 9, THEY WOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO SO.
IF
19:51:07  THEY QUALIFY.
GENERALLY SB 9
19:51:10  APPLIES TO SINGLE FAMILY ZONED PROPERTIES THROUGHOUT THE
19:51:14  STATE, ALTHOUGH THERE ARE SOME DISQUALIF
19:51:17 IERS SUCH AS BEING AN HISTORIC RESOURCE OR
19:51:21  BEING -- OR
19:51:24  BEING PRIMARY
19:51:27  AGRICULTURAL LAND.
SO VARIOUS REASONS COULD EXCLUDE THEM.
19:51:30 
BUT THE LAW IS IN EFFECT AND
19:51:34  SOMEONE COULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF SB 9 IF
19:51:37  THEY MET ALL THE CRITERIA.
THE CITY WILL BE ADOPTING A
19:51:40  LOCAL ORDINANCE WHICH IMPLEMENTS THE STATE LAW AND
19:51:43  ALSO PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE CITY TO
19:51:47  ADOPT SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE STANDARDS
19:51:50  RELATED TO AN SB 9 DEVELOPMENT, IF
19:51:53  THAT'S
WHAT THE CITY WOULD LIKE TO DO
19:51:57 .
REGARDING SB 35, WHICH
19:52:00  IS THE --
19:52:03  WHICH IS A BILL THAT PROVIDE
19:52:08 S FOR STREAMLINING AND BY RATE PROCESSING
19:52:11  OF CERTAIN PROJECTS, CERTAIN HOUSING PROJECTS HAD A
19:52:14  INCLUDE A LEVEL OF 
AFFORDABILITY, THAT'S
19:52:18  BEEN IN EFFECT FOR SEVERAL YEARS NOW
19:52:21 .
AND SOME AFFORDABLE
19:52:25  PROJECTS HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF SB
19:52:28  35 TO STREAMLINE THEIR APPROVAL PROCESS.
19:52:31 
SO THAT'S IN PLACE LOCALLY.
NOW THE
19:52:36  CITY -- SB 35 APPLIES TO JURISDICTION
19:52:39 S THAT HAVE NOT MET THEIR REGIONAL
19:52:42  HOUSING NEEDS ALLOCATIONS TARGETS.
19:52:47 
SO JURISDICTIONS THAT
19:52:51  HAVE MET ALL
19:52:55  THEIR RHNA TARGETS AT ALL INCOME LEVELS INCLUDING THE DEEP
19:52:58  DEEPER LEVELS OF AFFORDABILITY, THEY
19:53:02  AREN'T SUBJECT TO SB 35.
THE CITY OF FREMONT IS ONE
19:53:06  OF I WOULD SAY THE MAJORITY OF THE CITIES IN THE STATE THAT
19:53:09  FALL INTO THIS CATEGORY OF, WE'VE MET
19:53:14  OUR -- WE'VE MET OUR RHNA TARGET AT THE
19:53:17  ABOVE-MODERATE AND MODERATE -- AT
THE ABOVE
19:53:20  ABOVE-MODERATE LEVELS BUT NOT AT THE LOWER INCOME CATEGORIES
19:53:23 .
SO BASED ON THAT, THE
19:53:28  CITY WOULD -- BASED ON THAT PROJECTS THAT PROPOSE AT
19:53:31  LEAST 50% OF THE UNITS AS BEING AFFORDABLE
19:53:35  TO POTENTIALLY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF SB 35.

19:53:38 JURISDICTIONS THAT
19:53:44  HAVE NOT MET THEIR AFFORDABLE TARGETS OR THEIR
19:53:47  ABOVE MODERATE TARGETS ARE SUBJECT TO A DIFFERENT
19:53:50  TIER OF REVIEW WHERE
19:53:54  THEY ASK -- WHERE SB
19:53:57  35 COULD BE TRIGGERED BY AS LOW AS
19:54:00  10% OF
AFFORDABLE UNDER BEING PROVIDED
19:54:03  AS PART OF THAT PROJECT.
NOW, AS THE -- WE MOVE INTO
19:54:07  THE NEXT HOUSING ELEMENT CYCLE
19:54:10 , THE CITY
19:54:14  COULD IN THEORY MOVE INTO A DIFFERENT
19:54:17  TIER DEPENDING ON WHETHER WE ARE MEETING ALL OF
19:54:20  OUR TARGETS.
BECAUSE WE SAID
19:54:24  THAT THE TARGETS SUPER-
19:54:27 HIGH, RIGHT, MORE THAN TWICE THE
19:54:30  PREVIOUS CYCLE THERE IS A STRONG POSSIBILITY
19:54:33  THAT UNLESS WE ARE PRODUCING AT LEVELS
19:54:36  DURING LIKE THE PEAK YEARS
19:54:41  OF 2016, 2017,
2018,
19:54:44  THAT WE COULD BE IN THAT 10% TIER
19:54:47  MOVING FORWARD BUT THAT IS TO BE DETERMINED
19:54:50 .
>> Planner Pullen:   WAYLAND I WANT TO ADD ON TOP OF THAT
19:54:53 .
SO COMMISSIONER ZHANG, I BELIEVE YOU ALSO
19:54:56  MENTIONED 330, SB 3
19:55:00 30 AND WAYLAND, VERY
19:55:03  ACCURATELY DESCRIBED SB 35 WHICH IS
19:55:06  ACTUALLY PROBABLY MORE MEANINGFUL IN TERMS OF THE
19:55:11  CITY'S REVIEW OF PROJECTS, AND
OUR ABILITY
19:55:14  TO LOCAL CONTROLLED PROJECTS.
19:55:18 
SB 330, YOU THE SORT OF WANT TO KNOW
19:55:21  THE BIG PICTURE RESPONSE TO THAT FOR US IS WE ARE COMPLIANT
19:55:24  WITH THOSE TIME LINES AND THOSE OBJECTIVE REQUIREMENTS
19:55:27 .
AND WE HAVE THE PREAPPLICATION PROCESS THAT'S CALLED
19:55:30  FOR IN THAT FULLY IMPLEMENTED
19:55:34 , WE HAVE HAD SEVERAL PROJECTS GO THROUGH THAT
19:55:37  PROCESS.
SO ON THAT WHICH APPLIES TO EVERYBODY IN THE STATE
19:55:40  AGAIN WE'RE GOOD.
19:55:47 
>> Commissioner Zhang:   THANK YOU.
FROM ONE OF YOUR SLIDES IT SEEMS
19:55:50  LIKE WE'RE KIND OF SHORT
19:55:53  ON THOSE VERY
19:55:57  SHORT RHNA APPLICATIONS,
19:56:01  IN 2023, WILL FREMONT
19:56:04  GET PENLTZED FOR NOT MEETING THOSE NUMBERS, HOW
19:56:09 ?
19:56:12 
>> A CITY'S RESPONSIBILITY WITH REGARD TO THE
19:56:16  RHNA ALLOCATION IS TO HAVE SQUAT REZONED SITES IN
19:56:19  PLACE TO ACCOMMODATE THAT PRODUCTION AND ALSO, TO HAVE POLICIES
19:56:22  AND PROGRAMS TO REMOVE THE
19:56:25  BARRIERS AND
CONSTRAINTS TO BE ABLE TO
19:56:28  ACHIEVE THAT PRODUCTION.
CITIES
19:56:32  DON'T TYPICALLY CONSTRUCT HOUSING.
AND
19:56:35  THAT'S GENERALLY BEEN A FUNCTION OF THE PRIVATE SECTOR.
19:56:38 
BUT BECAUSE OF THAT FRAMEWORK
19:56:42 , THERE
19:56:47  TRADITIONAL
19:56:51 LY NOT BEEN TARGETS, SB 35, IF
19:56:54  YOU'RE NOT MEETING YOUR TARGETS YOU COULD BE SUBJECT
19:56:58  TO MINISTERIAL STREAMLINED
19:57:01  REVIEW FOR
CERTAIN TYPES OF PROJECTS THAT PROVIDE
19:57:04  CERTAIN AFFORDABILITY LEVELS.
BUT OUTSIDE MUCH THAT,
19:57:07  OF THERE
19:57:10 , THE CITY DOESN'T FACE PENALTIES FOR NOT MEETING
19:57:14  THOSE TARGETS, AT LEAST FOR TIME BEING.
AS YOU KNOW THE
19:57:17  LANDSCAPE OF STATE HOUSING LEGISLATION IS
19:57:24  CONSTANTLY EVOLVING.
SO WHILE THERE ARE BESIDES
19:57:28  SB 35 THERE AREN'T BIG IMPLICATIONS IN TERMS OF PENALTIES
19:57:31  FOR NOT MEETING OUR TARGETS
19:57:34 , ARE THERE GOING TO BE
19:57:37  OTHER IMPLICATIONS MOVING
19:57:41  FORWARD?
YOU KNOW WE DON'T KNOW, BUT IT'S A POSSIBILITY.

19:57:51 >> Commissioner Zhang:   THANK YOU.
>> Commissioner Daulton:    MR. LIU
19:57:54 .
>> Commissioner Liu:   YES, THIS IS A QUESTION FOR WAYLAND
19:57:58  AND COURTNEY.
SO IN ONE OF THE SLIDES REGARDING
19:58:01  FREMONT RHNA PRODUCTION, IT SHOWED
19:58:05  THAT THERE ARE FOR VERY LOW INCOME UNITS
19:58:08 , THERE ARE 493, ALL
19:58:12  THESE THREE CATEGORIES, LOW INCOME AND MODERATE
19:58:15  INCOME UNITS ARE
COMBINED TO BE AROUND JUST UNDER A
19:58:18  THOUSAND UNITS.
ARE MOST OF
19:58:22  THEM FOR RENT, OR FOR PURCHASE?
AND CAN YOU GIVE
19:58:25  ME A ROUGH BREAKDOWN
19:58:28  OF THESE BELOW
19:58:32  MARKET RATE HOUSING?

19:58:37 >> GOOD EVENING, PLANNING COMMISSIONERS, MY NAME IS
19:58:41  DAN SCHOENHOLZ AND I'M
19:58:45  THE COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT DIRECTOR AND
19:58:49  I'M HERE TONIGHT BECAUSE OUR HOUSING MANAGER LUCIA HUGHES
19:58:52  WAS UNAVAILABLE SO I'M
STEPPING IN.

19:58:55 SO IN TERMS OF YOUR QUESTION, COMMISSIONER
19:59:00 , BASICALLY, THE VAST, VAST
19:59:03  MAJORITY OF THOSE ARE RENTAL UNITS.

19:59:06 WE DO HAVE A
19:59:09  FEW INCLUSIONARY UNITS, I DON'T HAVE THE
19:59:13  NUMBER OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD.
BUT BASICALLY,
19:59:17  THE BULK OF OUR
19:59:20  AFFORDABLE HOUSING PRODUCTION IS IN
19:59:24  RENTAL UNITS.
AND THAT'S A SPECIFIC POLICY
19:59:28  CHOICE THAT THE
19:59:31  CITY COUNCIL HAS MADE OVER THE YEARS.
WE USED
19:59:34  TO -- 20 YEARS AGO, OUR AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROGRAMS WERE
19:59:38  ESSENTIALLY REQUIRING  INCLUSIONARY UNITS
19:59:41  IN OWNERSHIP PROJECTS.
AND SO WE GOT THESE
19:59:44  BELOW MARKET RATE FOR-SALE HOMES AND
19:59:48  THEY WERE
19:59:51  GENERALLY FOR SALE TO MODERATE
19:59:54  INCOME FAMILIES, AND THAT WAS OUR AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROGRAM.

19:59:57 AND THEN OVER THE YEARS THERE WAS A RECOGNITION THAT WE NEEDED
20:00:01  TO DEVOTE MORE RESOURCES TO HOUSING FOR
20:00:04  FOLKS AT THE LOWER END OF THE INCOME SCALE.
20:00:08 
AND THAT SORT OF PUSHED THE
20:00:12  POLICIES TOWARDS R
20:00:15  RENTAL UNITS.
SO THAT'S WHERE WE SEE MOST OF THE PRODUCTION
20:00:18  NOWADAYS.
WE GET OCCASIONALLY A DEVELOPER
20:00:22  WHO WANTS TO DO MODERATE INCOME FOR-
20:00:25 SALE INCLUSIONARY UNIT AS PART OF THEIR PROJECT BUT IN TERMS
20:00:29  OF NUMBERS IT'S A VERY SMALL PERCENTAGE
20:00:33 .
>> Commissioner Liu:   SO IS IT ACCURATE TO SAY THERE IS ONLY WHEN
20:00:37  A DEVELOPER DECIDES TO
20:00:41  BUILD BELOW MARKET RATE HOUSING ON THEIR
20:00:44  SPECIFIC DEVELOPMENT SITES, WILL YOU GET BELOW MARKET RATE
20:00:47  HOUSING,
BUT ANY OTHER PROJECTS WILL
20:00:50  BE FOR RENT ONLY?
20:00:54 
>> YES, IF THEY'RE BUILDING OWNERSHIP
20:00:57  AND THEY -- OWNERSHIP UNITS AND THEY DECIDE TO
20:01:00  DO INCLUSIONARY ONSITE THEN WE
20:01:03  GET OWNERSHIP UNITS.
BUT WE HAVE -- OUR
20:01:06  ORDINANCE HAS LOTS OF DIFFERENT POSSIBLE WAYS
20:01:10  FOR DEVELOPERS TO COMPLY.
THE MOST COMMON
20:01:13  ONE IS THAT THEY WILL PAY A FEE TO THE
20:01:16  CITY, AND THE CITY USES THAT MONEY TO
20:01:20  SUBSIDIZE AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS THAT ARE PRODUCED BUY
20:01:23   NONPROFIT HOUSING DEVELOPER.
BUT ANOTHER WAY
20:01:26  THAT DEVELOPERS CAN MEET THAT OBLIGATION IS
20:01:30  BY BUILDING ONSITE RENTAL UNITS AS
20:01:33  WELL OR AS PART OF THEIR  PROJECT.
AND IN WARM SPRINGS
20:01:36  WE'VE GOT OVER 500 UNITS FROM DEVELOPERS
20:01:40  WHO ARE BUILDING OWNERSHIP UNITS FOR SALE
20:01:43 .
AND THEN THEY
20:01:46  ALSO WORKED WITH NONPROFIT DEVELOPERS, OR
20:01:49  IN ONE CASE A FOR PROFIT DEVELOPER,
20:01:53  TO BUILD ONSITE RENTAL AFFORDABLE HOUSING.
20:01:56 
AND THAT'S PERMISSIBLE UNDER OUR ORDINANCE
20:01:59  AND WAS REALLY SORT OF PART OF THE PLAN FOR
20:02:02  THE WHOLE WARM SPRINGS DEVELOPMENT.
>> Commissioner Liu: 
20:02:05   OKAY, ANOTHER FULL-UP QUESTION, FOR THOSE
20:02:09  FOR RENTAL UNIT, FOR THOSE VERY
20:02:12  LOW INCOME FOLKS
20:02:15 , 493  UNITS, WHAT IS A TYPICAL
20:02:19  MONTHLY RENT THAT THE RENTERS HAVE TO PAY
20:02:24 ?
>> YEAH -- I DON'T
20:02:27  HAVE -- I DON'T HAVE -- WE CAN
20:02:30  PROVIDE THE CHART.
THERE IS SORT OF A TABLE.
IT
20:02:33  DEPENDS ON THE HOUSEHOLD SIZE AND THE INCOME LEVELS
20:02:36 .
BUT VERY LOW INCOME IS 50
20:02:39 % OR BELOW
20:02:43  OF THE AREA MEDIAN INCOME FOR A
20:02:47  PARTICULAR FAMILY SIZE.
AND THERE'S
20:02:51  ESSENTIALLY THE HOUSING AND URBAN
20:02:54  DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT PUTS OUT EVERY YEAR SORT OF A SPREADSHEET
20:02:57  THAT SHOWS WHAT THE ALLOWABLE RENTS ARE.
IT CHANGES EVERY YEAR.

20:03:00 WE COULD CERTAINLY PROVIDE YOU WITH THAT CHART, SO YOU
20:03:03  CAN SEE WHAT THE RENTS ARE.
BUT I DON'T HAVE IT COMMITTED
20:03:06  TO MEMORY.
>> Commissioner Liu:   OKAY, THANK YOU
20:03:09 .
>> Commissioner Daulton:   ALL RIGHT.
MY TURN
20:03:14 .
I THINK
20:03:18 .
>> Commissioner Yee:   WAIT, I HAD MY HAND UP CHAIR.
20:03:21 
>> Commissioner Daulton:   OH, OKAY.
>> Commissioner Yee:   SORRY.

20:03:24 >> Commissioner Daulton:   OKAY CHAIR RECOGNIZES COMMISSIONER YEE.
>> Commissioner Yee:   THANK YOU
20:03:27  YOU.
I PROMISE I HAVE ONE QUESTION.
IT'S RELATED TO
20:03:30  SB 9.
I'M JUST WONDERING SINCE JANUARY
20:03:33  1st HOW MANY APPLICATIONS HAVE WE SEEN
20:03:37  RELATED TO SB 9 FROM THIS CITY
20:03:41 ?
>> WE HAVE NOT SEEN ANY APPLICATIONS UNDER SB
20:03:44  9.
ALTHOUGH WE HAVE FIELD
20:03:47 ED QUITE A FEW QUESTIONS ABOUT IT.
BUT WE HAVEN'T HAD
20:03:51  ANYBODY TO A LEVEL OF ACTUALLY HAVING AN APPLICATION SUBMITTED YET.
20:03:54 
WHICH IS NOT -- WHICH IS
20:03:58  NOT  ATYPICAL FOR THE REGION IN THE
20:04:01  STATE, AS BOTH
20:04:06  DEVELOPERS OR FOLKS FROM THE
20:04:09  DEVELOPMENT SIDE AND CITIES KIND OF WRESTLE WITH
20:04:12  HOW TO DEAL WITH THE NUANCES OF THE LAW.
BUT WE
20:04:15  HAVE -- TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION WE HAVE NOT PROCESS
20:04:18 ED ANY SB 9 APPLICATION
20:04:22 S YET.
>> Commissioner Yee:   THANK  YOU.
20:04:25 
>> Commissioner Daulton:   COMMISSIONER ZHANG.

20:04:28 >> Commissioner Zhang:   JUST A COMMENT WHAT I HEARD FROM A RECENT SEMINAR
20:04:31  IS SB 9 WON'T BE VERY EFFECTIVE IN TERM
20:04:35  OF SOLVING THIS HOUSING ISSUE.
BECAUSE I THINK THE PROJECTION IS
20:04:38  PROBABLY 5%
20:04:42  OF THE RHNA MAY BE CONTRIBUTED MANY
20:04:45  I'M NOT FOR AN EXACT NUMBER BUT SB 9
20:04:49  WON'T HELP VERY MUCH ON THESE HOUSING ISSUES.
>> Commissioner Yee:  
20:04:53  IT IS  5.84%.

20:04:56 >> SOME ANALYSIS HAS BEEN DONE ABOUT SB 9 INDICATES
20:05:00  THAT LIKE A RELATIVELY LOW PERCENTAGE
20:05:04  OF
20:05:07  SINGLE
20:05:11  FAMILY ZONED PARCELS IT WILL MAKE SENSE FOR THEM TO DEVELOP
20:05:14  WITH AN SB 9 PROJECT
20:05:17 .
AND, YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE
20:05:21  TO BE SEEING HOW MANY
20:05:24  UNITS WILL BE DEVELOPED
20:05:28  UNDER SB 9 OR THE --
20:05:32  THIS RHNA PERIOD, RIGHT NOW IT'S VERY SPECULATIVE BECAUSE
20:05:36  IT IS BRAND-NEW AND WE DON'T HAVE ANY DATA
20:05:39  TO
SUPPORT HOW MANY UNITS MIGHT ACTUALLY
20:05:43  BE -- MIGHT ACTUALLY
20:05:47  BE --
20:05:52 
>> Commissioner Zhang:   THE CITY HAS TO APPROVE TO
20:05:55  ACCEPT SB 9 BEFORE ACCEPTING ANY SB
20:05:59  9 APPLICATIONS RIGHT?
>> THE CITY DOES NOT HAVE TO
20:06:02  ADOPT A LOCAL ORDINANCE
20:06:06  BEFORE ACCEPTING
20:06:09  AN SB 9 APPLICATION.
>> Planner Pullen:  
20:06:12  I WANT TO MENTION IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR QUESTION ABOUT SB 9 IS
20:06:15  WE ALREADY HAVE A TOOL THAT'S DOING PART OF WHAT SB 9
20:06:18  IS INTENDING.
SB 9 IS INTENDING TO MAKE
20:06:22  A ONE UNIT SITE, FOUR UNITS
20:06:25 .
BUT TRUE STANDARD A
20:06:28 DU LAWS ALREADY ON THE BOOKS,
20:06:31  A SITE CAN HAVE THREE UNITS ALREADY.
NOW THE SIZES
20:06:34  ARE A LITTLE DIFFERENT UNDER SB 9.
THE FEES ARE
20:06:37  WAIVED FOR THESE KIND OF UNITS WHERE THEY'RE NOT FOR
20:06:40  SB 9.
AND SO THROUGHOUT THE CITY WE
20:06:44  HAVE SEEN A HUGE INCREASE IN THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE TAKING ADVANTAGE
20:06:47  OF THE ABILITY TO PUT
20:06:51  AN ADU ON THEIR PROPERTY, TO
20:06:54  CONVERT A SPACE NEW SPACE ET CETERA.
AND THAT FORMS SOME
20:06:58  OF THE POTENTIAL ADDITIONAL AFFORDABLE BY
20:07:01  DESIGN UNITS THAT WILL BE SPRINKLED THROUGHOUT THE COMMUNITY.

20:07:04 YOU KNOW MORE WIDELY THAN LET'S SAY
20:07:07  THE SITES INVENTORY WILL BE SHOWN.

20:07:13 >> Commissioner Daulton:   OKAY.
I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS
20:07:17 .
20:07:21 
SO JUST A CLARIFYING QUESTION.
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LIKE
20:07:24  THE ZONING FOR THE ALLOCATION,
20:07:27  AND THEN THE ACTUAL NUMBER OF PERMITS THAT
20:07:30  WE GET FOR THE ALLOCATION
20:07:33 ?
I SAW ON YOUR CHART IT
20:07:36  MENTIONED PRODUCTION, VERSUS GOAL.
IS
20:07:40  THAT HOW THAT IS?
AND FURTHER,
20:07:44  DOES SACRAMENTO LOOK AT BUILDING
20:07:47  PERMITS IN TERMS OF THEIR ASSESSMENT
20:07:50  OF HOW WE'VE DONE OR DO THEY SIMPLY LOOK AT
20:07:53  ZONING?
20:07:58 
>> Planner Pullen:   THIS IS A VARIATION OF YOUR EARLIER QUESTION I 
20:08:01 THINK WHICH IS WHAT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY AND
20:08:04  WHAT'S BEING GRADED.
BEEN
20:08:08 WELL, OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS
20:08:11  TO ZONE TO SITES AND MAYBE ONE WAY TO SAY THIS, TO SORT
20:08:14  OF SET THE TABLE WITH OUR AVAILABLE SITES, WITH OUR POLICIES,
20:08:17  WITH PROGRAMS, TO GET THE
20:08:21  PRODUCTION TO HAPPEN.
BUT WE CAN'T CONTROL
20:08:24  THE  ECONOMY.
THE PACE OF
20:08:27  PRODUCTION BY THE PRIVATE MARKET, KEEP IN
20:08:31  MIND, YOU KNOW, I THINK I WAS HERE IN THE
20:08:34  GREAT RECESSION, END OF 2008 ON,
20:08:37  WE DIDN'T PRODUCE VERY MUCH HOUSING FOR YEARS.
AND I'M
20:08:41  NOT -- I DON'T KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN THE NEXT EIGHT
20:08:44  YEARS.
THERE COULD BE AN UPSWING, COULD BE A DOWN
20:08:47 SWING AND THE REALITIES OF THE MARKET
20:08:50  WILL DICTATE HOW MUCH HOUSING GETS
20:08:54  BUILT.
WHAT OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO MAKE IT ABLE TO BE BUILT
20:08:57  AND THE STATE WILL EVALUATE US ON WHETHER
20:09:00  OUR HOUSING ELEMENT SETS THAT
20:09:04  TABLE, SO THEY WILL BE BUILT.
WE MAY
20:09:07  ALSO GET BEHIND.
THAT'S WHERE SB 35 COMES
20:09:10  IN.
OUTSIDE OF OUR CONTROL THERE COULD BE
20:09:13  A DEFICIT OF HOUSING BUILT, WE CAN LOOK AT
20:09:17  THAT AND SEE IF THERE ARE WAYS TO ADDRESS IT BUT ULTIMATELY IF
20:09:20  IT'S DRIVEN BY A ECONOMIC OR SOCIAL ISSUE THAT'S
20:09:23  OUTSIDE
MUCH OUR C
20:09:26  OF OUR CONTROL.
>> Commissioner Daulton:  
20:09:30  OKAY SO IN TERMS OF GETTING 13,000 UNITS
20:09:33  ZONED IN FREMONT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WE NEED TO
20:09:36  REALLY ADDRESS DENSITY ALONG THAT CORRIDOR
20:09:39 .
IF THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN AT ALL.

20:09:42 AND SO I SORT OF AM LOOKING
20:09:46  FOR AT LEAST DISCUSSION OF
20:09:49  SOME MORE RADICAL IDEAS AROUND THAT.
FOR EXAMPLE
20:09:54 , ZEROING OUT PARKING MINIMUMS
20:09:57  AND TOD'S, HAVE YOU GUYS CONSIDERED THAT
20:10:00  AT ALL?
20:10:07 
>> ANALYZING PARKING AS A CONSTRAINT TO HOUSING IS
20:10:11  A MANDATORY COMPONENT OF THE HOUSING ELEMENT PROCESS
20:10:16 .
SO WHEN WE REPORT TO THE STATE
20:10:19 , WE'LL NEED TO PROVIDE ANALYSIS OF WHAT THE EFFECT
20:10:22  OF PARKING IS
20:10:25  ON HOUSING DEVELOPMENT
20:10:28 .
AND IS IT A CONSTRAINT THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED TO
20:10:31  ADDRESS OUR
20:10:35  HOUSING NEEDS.
>> Commissioner Daulton:  
20:10:38  WELL, DON'T YOU THINK THAT ELIMINATING PARK
20:10:41 ING MINIMUMS AROUND TRANSIT HUBS IS A POSSIBLE WAY
20:10:45  TO SKYROCKET DENSITY, OR AT LEAST
20:10:48  INCENTIVIZE DENSITY IN THOSE AREAS?
>> YES,
20:10:52  IN CONCEPT, REDUCING PARKING DOES FACILITATE HOUSING
20:10:56  PRODUCTION, HIGHER DENSITIES.
>> Commissioner Daulton: 
20:10:59   SO ARE YOU GUYS LOOKING INTO THAT IN TERMS OF THE NEW ZONING
20:11:02  THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE DOING?
>> WELL, THAT'S A
20:11:06  POLICY OPTION THAT WILL
20:11:09  BE -- THAT WILL BE UP FOR
20:11:13  DISCUSSION AND DECISION MAKING BY YOU AS THE PLANNING COMMISSION AS WELL AS
20:11:17  THE CITY COUNCIL.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   OKAY.
>> Planner Pullen:  
20:11:20  THERE ARE PLACES IN TOWN, CHAIR DAULTON, WHERE WE HAVE ELIMINATED PARKING
20:11:23  PARKING.
WE HAVE PARKING MAXIMUM ACTUALLY IN
20:11:26  WARM SPRINGS.
AND THE
20:11:29  MARKET'S CHOSEN TO BUILD VARYING AMOUNTS OF
20:11:32  HOUSING WITHIN THAT PARKING
20:11:36  ALLOWANCE.
ABOVE THE MINIMUM, YOU KNOW, BUT NOT UP TO
20:11:39  THE MAXIMUM.
AND IT'S BURIED
20:11:42  A LITTLE BIT AMONG THOSE DEVELOPMENTS.
THERE ARE A LOT OF CATEGORIES
20:11:45  OF DEVELOPMENT ALREADY, WHETHER IT BE WITHIN TOD
20:11:49 'S, WHETHER IT BE AFFORDABLE HOUSING, DENSITY BONUS
20:11:53 ES SOMETIMES CAN LEAD TO PARKING BEING REDUCED TO VERY LOW
20:11:56  NUMBERS.
AND SO THAT'S ALREADY IN THE POLICY
20:11:59  FRAMEWORK.
WE'VE ALSO SEEN SOME OTHER
20:12:03  CITIES TRUE REDUCING OR ELIMINATING PARKING REQUIREMENTS BUT
20:12:06  ALSO THE STATE CONSIDERING LEGISLATIVE ACTION TO DO THE
20:12:09  SAME.
SO THAT'S DEFINITELY THE DIRECTION.
WE HAVE TO THINK
20:12:12  ABOUT CONTEXT OF THE DEVELOPMENTS, AND THE
20:12:16  SAME STANDARDS MAY NOT WORK IN EVERY SITUATION
20:12:20  GIVEN RELATIVE DENSITY SURROUNDING
20:12:24  THOSE LOCATIONS.
SO IT'S SOMETHING WE CAN DEFINITELY TAKE THE COMMENT
20:12:28  AND THINK ABOUT.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   SURE.
IN THAT
20:12:31  SAME REGARD IN REGARDS TO THE AFFORDABLE OR
20:12:34  LOW INCOME HOUSING, AGAIN I'M GOING TO BRING UP
20:12:37  THE AFFORDABLE ZONING OVERLAY THAT THEY HAVE INSTITUTED
20:12:40  IN BERKELEY.
20:12:44 
IN WHICH THE AFFORDABLE DEVELOPERS GET FIRST
20:12:47  CRACK, AND STREAMLINE
20:12:51 ED APPLICATION PROCESS, TOWARDS THEIR DEVELOPMENTS
20:12:55  OVER MARKET RATE DEVELOPERS.
IS THAT GOING TO BE
20:12:58  A COMPONENT THAT WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT HERE TOO
20:13:03 ?
20:13:06 
>> I MEAN, I CAN START ON THAT.
WE ACTUALLY DO HAVE
20:13:10  ACCELERATED TIME LINES FOR REVIEWS OF
20:13:13  AFFORDABLE PROJECTS.
THAT'S IN OUR BUILDING PERMIT PROCESS
20:13:17 .
IN TERMS OF ENTITLEMENT REVIEWS
20:13:22 , NOTHING FORL.
BUT
20:13:25  FORMAL.
BUT
20:13:28  THE AFFORDABLE PROJECTS
20:13:31   ARE'S ON TIGHT TIME LINES AND THEY
20:13:35  HAVE TO HAVE THEIR PERMITS ISSUED WITHIN
20:13:38  SIX MONTHS.
AND
20:13:41  SO TYPICALLY, WE'RE TURNING
20:13:44  THOSE AROUND FASTER THAN WE ARE
20:13:47  MARKET RATE PROJECTS
20:13:51 .
WE DON'T HAVE AN AFFORDABLE HOUSING OVER
20:13:54 LAY ZONE, ANYTHING
20:13:58  FORMAL BUT WE'VE BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL IN MEETING THE
20:14:01  TIME LINES THAT AFFORDABLE HOUSING
20:14:04  DEVELOPERS NEED.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   BUT WE HAVEN'T BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN MEETING
20:14:09  THE RHNA ALLOCATION NUMBER IN TERMS OF UNITS.

20:14:12 IN A VERY BROAD SENSE THE BERKELEY ORDINANCE
20:14:17  ALLOWS AFFORDABLE DEVELOPERS FIRST CRACK AT CITY PROPERTIES THAT ARE GOING TO BE DEVELOPED
20:14:22 .
20:14:29 
AND IN THAT WAY, THEY CAN GET IN FRONT OF THE LINE THERE
20:14:32  AND NOT JUST VIA A STREAMLINED APPLICATION
20:14:36  PROCESS BUT VIA A FRONT OF THE LINE SITUATION
20:14:39  FOR ACQUIRING PROPERTY RIGHTS AND
20:14:43  POTENTIAL PROPERTY
TO BUILD ON.
20:14:46 
>> ACTUALLY, WHAT --
>> Commissioner Daulton:   AND 
20:14:49 BERKELEY IS CITYWIDE RATHER THAN SPECIFICALLY ZONED.
20:14:52 
>> YEAH, I MEAN WE CAN DEFINITELY TAKE A LOOK AT
20:14:56  THAT BUT ACTUALLY UNDER STATE LAW WE ARE ALREADY REQUIRED TO
20:14:59  GIVE AFFORDABLE DEVELOPERS FIRST CRACK AT ANY
20:15:03  SURPLUS CITY PROPERTY.
THERE IS A LOCK ON THE SURPLUS LANDS ACT
20:15:06  THAT REQUIRES THAT WE FIRST OFFER UP
20:15:09  PROPERTIES FOR EITHER AFFORDABLE HOUSING
20:15:12  OR FOR PARK USES
20:15:16 , AND, YOU KNOW, THEN,
20:15:19  IF THERE ARE NO AFFORDABLE DEVELOPERS THAT
20:15:22 
ARE INTERESTED OR CAN KIND OF PUT A PACKAGE TOGETHER,
20:15:26  THEN IT CAN BE MARKETED MORE BROADLY
20:15:29 .
SO I WOULD HAVE TO LOOK AT THE BERKELEY
20:15:33  PROGRAM AND KIND OF SEE HOW IT'S DIFFERENT FROM STATE LAW.
20:15:36 
WE CAN CERTAINLY DO THAT.
AND I DON'T KNOW IF JOEL OR
20:15:39   WAYLAND MAYBE YOU KNOW MORE ABOUT THAT
20:15:43  PARTICULAR BERKELEY POLICY
20:15:47 ?
>> I'LL ADD THAT A COUPLE OF
20:15:50  YEARS AGO, THE STATE ADOPTED A PIECE OF
20:15:53  LEGISLATION, AB 1397,
20:15:56  WHICH REQUIRES THAT WHEN A CITY USE
20:16:01 S A SITE FOR ITS HOUSING
20:16:04  ELEMENT FOR MORE THAN ONE CYCLE
20:16:07 , IT COULD BE ONE
OR TWO CYCLES, DEPENDING
20:16:10  ON WHETHER IT'S VACANT PROPERTY OR NOT, IT
20:16:14  REQUIRES THAT CITIES PROVIDE
20:16:17  FOR BY-RIGHT PROCESSING
20:16:21  OF HOUSING
20:16:24  PROPOSALS ON THOSE LOCATIONS WHEN THEY PROVIDE CERTAIN LEVEL
20:16:28  OF
AFFORDABLE HOUSING WHICH IS 20%.
THE MECHANISM WHICH
20:16:31  MOST CITIES AROUND THE STATE ARE EMPLOYING TO
20:16:34  MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF AB 1397 IS TO
20:16:37  ADOPT AN AFFORDABLE HOUSING OVERLAY ZONE
20:16:40 , WHERE IT OVERLAYS
20:16:44  SPECIFIC
20:16:49  STANDARDS AND
20:16:53  PROCESSING
REQUIREMENTS, FOR THOSE TYPES OF PROPERTIES THAT ARE
20:16:56  PROVIDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING TO ENCOURAGE
20:16:59  THAT PRODUCTION.
SO THAT'S -- I THINK BERKELEY
20:17:03 'S MODEL IS DOING A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN THAT.
20:17:06 
BUT CITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE ARE LOOKING AT
20:17:11  SIMILAR ZONING TOOLS TO
20:17:14  STAFF AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THAT WAY AND, YOU KNOW, I THINK
20:17:19  LIKELY WILL FREMONT.
BECAUSE OUR NUMBER IS SO HIGH IT'S
20:17:22  UNAVOIDABLE
20:17:25  THAT WE'LL BE REUSING
20:17:28  SITES.
IT IS PART THAT
20:17:31  WILL REQUIRE CONVICTION.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   AND THE OTHER PART THAT I WOULD ALSO
20:17:35  BE INTERESTED IN SEEING IS EVEN FURTHER
20:17:41  95
20:17:44  INCENTIVIZE
20:17:47 ATION, CLEARLY WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET THERE WITH
20:17:51 
TOWN HOUSES AND WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET THERE WITH 2500
20:17:54  SQUARE FOOT APARTMENTS EITHER OR CONDOMINIUMS, WHICH
20:17:57  IS A BIG PART OF WHAT WE SEEM TO BE  GETTING THESE DAYS
20:18:02 .
SO I KNOW WE DO HAVE SOME
20:18:05  INCENTIVES IN PLACE NOR THAT BUT I THINK CLEARLY, IF YOU ARE GOING
20:18:08  TO MEET 13,000 UNITS, IN THE LIMITED SPACE
20:18:12  THAT WE HAVE, IN A WAY THAT IS
20:18:16  TRULY  STRATEGICALLY
URBANIZED YOU'RE GOING TO
20:18:19  HAVE TO LOOK FOR SOME SMALLER UNITS AND THEY'RE GOING
20:18:22  TO HAVE TO BE DENSELY PACKED.
ONE
20:18:25  THING I, IN LOOKING AT OUR NUMBERS FROM THE LAST
20:18:28   ALLOCATION, WE EXCEEDED OUR
20:18:32  RHNA NUMBERS OVER THAT PERIOD BY
20:18:35  NEARLY A THIRD, RIGHT?
THIRD AGAIN.
20:18:39 
SO WE ASKED FOR 5,000, WE
20:18:42  GOT  7,000.
SO I THINK WHEN THE
20:18:45  PUBLIC SEES HOW
20:18:48  MANY -- HOW MUCH BUILDING IS GOING ON WE ALL KNOW IT'S
20:18:52  NOT POPULAR.
RIGHT?
WE
20:18:55  GET -- I HEAR IT ALL DAY  LONG,
20:18:58  YOU KNOW.
OH THEY'RE JUST BUILDING AND BUILDING AND WHAT
20:19:01  ABOUT THE SCHOOLS AND WHAT ABOUT THE ROADS AND WHAT ABOUT THE
20:19:04  TRANSIT, YOU KNOW.
IT'S LEGITIMATE.
I REALIZE THERE'S
20:19:07  A WHOLE SEGMENT OF OLD SCHOOL FREMONT THAT
20:19:11  JUST WANTS THEIR FARMS BACK AND THAT'S NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN
20:19:14  HAPPEN.
BUT THEIR QUESTION IS NOT WRONG,
20:19:17  IN THAT IF WE'RE GOING TO
20:19:21  PUSH FOR THIS NUMBER OF UNITS, AND IN FACT
20:19:24 , ACCORDING TO RECENT HISTORY, FAR
20:19:28  EXCEED THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE STATE, IN TERMS
20:19:32  OF BUILDING IN
FREMONT, RIGHT
20:19:36 ?
LITERALLY BY A FULL THIRD OF WHAT THEY ASKED US TO
20:19:39 , WE  EXCEEDED IT.
SO
20:19:42  IF THAT HISTORY CONTINUES ITSELF, THEN I
20:19:46  CAN'T READ THE TEA LEAVES OFTEN THAT.
20:19:49  ON THAT
20:19:52  BUTTER WE'RE TALKING ABOUT 20,000 UNITS IN THE NEXT
20:19:57  RHNA ALLOCATION, RATHER THAN 13
20:20:00 .
THEY ASKED FOR 5, WE GAVE THEM 7.
IF YOU
20:20:04  KEEP DOING THOSE NUMBERS WE'RE GOING TO
20:20:07  EXCEED THAT.
FREMONT IS A VERY POPULAR PLACE TO BUILD AND A VERY POPULAR
20:20:10  PLACE TO LIVE.
LET'S FACE IT.
SO I
20:20:14  THINK ONE OF THE QUESTIONS I HAVE OR ONE OF THE THOUGHTS
20:20:17  I CONSTANTLY HAVE IS THAT YES, WE ALL WANT
20:20:21  STRATEGIC URBANISM HERE IN THE TRANSIT
20:20:24  CORRIDOR.
HOW DO YOU SELL THAT TO THE PUBLIC IN SUCH A WAY
20:20:28  THAT THEY FEEL LIKE THEY'RE STILL RETAINING THE
20:20:31  FREMONT THAT WE CAME HERE TO LIVE IN,
20:20:35  AND NOT ONLY THAT, BUT BUILDING IN SUCH A
20:20:38  WAY SO THAT THEIR
LIFESTYLES ARE STILL EFFICIENT.
NOW
20:20:41 , I KNOW THAT WE'RE TRYING TO PUSH PEOPLE ONTO
20:20:44  TRANSIT AND I'M BEHIND THAT ALL THE WAY.
BECAUSE I THINK
20:20:47  THAT THAT'S, LET'S FACE IT, I THINK THAT'S THE
20:20:51  ONLY WAY WE CAN TACKLE THE GREENHOUSE
20:20:54  EMERGENCY, IT'S THE ONLY WAY WE CAN TACKLES
20:20:58  THE CONGESTION ON OUR STREETS.

20:21:03 BUT, YOU KNOW, THE PUBLIC IS GOING TO
20:21:06  SEE LIKE -- I MEAN SUCH A LITTLE THING AS
20:21:09 , TO ME, A SMALL THING IS BIKE LANES.
LOOK
20:21:13  AT THE UPROAR THAT BIKE LANES HAVE
20:21:16  CAUSED IN FREMONT OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS, RIGHT?
20:21:19 
PEOPLE ARE CRAZY ANGRY ABOUT THIS.
20:21:22 
SO I FEEL LIKE WE'VE GOT TO
20:21:25  APPROACH THIS IN SUCH A WAY THAT IT'S NOT
20:21:29  ONLY MEETING THE RHNA
20:21:33  NUMBERS REQUIRED BY THE STATE BUT MEETING THEM IN
20:21:36  A WAY THAT'S CONVENIENT AND EFFICIENT FOR THE PEOPLE WHO
LIVE HERE.
20:21:39 
AND IF WE CAN'T DO THAT, THEN WE'RE ADDING PROBLEMS
20:21:43  TO AN ALREADY DIFFICULT SITUATION FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE
20:21:47 .
20:21:50 
AND FURTHER, I REALLY AM LOOKING FOR, MYSELF
20:21:53 , SOME FAIRLY RADICAL IDEAS
20:21:56  REGARDING HOW WE'RE GOING TO GET MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING
20:22:00  AROUND HERE.
AND I KNOW THAT IT'S A STATEWIDE
20:22:03  PROBLEM.
IT'S JUST EXPENSIVE IN CALIFORNIA
20:22:07 .
IT'S JUST BECOME THAT WAY.
BUT
20:22:10  THAT MAY BE THE CASE, BUT WE'RE NOT GOING TO
20:22:13  SOLVE IT BY CONTINUING TO DO WHAT WE HAVE DONE
20:22:17 .
THAT'S JUST NOT GOING TO WORK, OBVIOUSLY.
20:22:20 
BECAUSE WE'RE JUST -- NOBODY IS FIXING IT
20:22:23  THAT WAY.
20:22:27 
SO I'M TRYING TO
20:22:30  THROW OUT THESE THINGS THAT I KNOW, I DON'T  KNOW,
20:22:34  SORT OF HAVE ALREADY BEEN ADDRESSED BY STATE LAW
20:22:37  OR SORT OF HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED BY CITY ORDINANCE
20:22:40  OR SORT OF BEEN ADDRESSED BY
INCENTIVE
20:22:44  THE STUFF WE'VE DONE ALREADY AND IT'S NOT BEEN QUITE
20:22:47  ENOUGH, RIGHT?
BECAUSE EVERYBODY WANTS TO BUILD
20:22:50  A $1.7 MILLION TOWN HOUSE IN FREMONT
20:22:53  BUT NOBODY WANTS TO GIVE THE JANITOR A JOB WHERE
20:22:56  HE CAN
20:23:00  LIVE HERE OR A TEACHER WHERE THEY CAN LIVE HERE.
SO I
20:23:03  THINK AT SOME POINT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO LOOK AT THAT WITH A
20:23:06  VERY HARD EYE AND PASS LEGISLATION
20:23:09  OR PASS AN ORDINANCE HERE THAT CAN MAYBE
20:23:13  MAKE SOME OF THAT HAPPEN A LITTLE BETTER THAN WE HAVE
ALREADY
20:23:16 .
THAT'S ALL.
>> Planner Pullen:   I PICKED A
20:23:19  FEW THINGS OUT OF WHAT YOU SAID AND I WANT TO RESPOND TO THEM BECAUSE
20:23:22  I THINK THEY'RE GOOD POINTS AND WE NEED TO
20:23:25  THINK CREATIVELY ABOUT HOW TO DO THIS.
I WILL
20:23:29  SAY WHEN I STARTED WITH THE CITY, WHAT YOU'RE
20:23:32  DESCRIBING WITH RESPECT TO THE TOWN HOUSES WAS
20:23:36  VERY COMMONLY WHAT WAS BEING BUILT.
BUT THERE HAS BEEN A
20:23:39  CHANGE, YOU KNOW.
IF I LOOK DOWNTOWN AND IN OUR
20:23:42  CITY CENTER THERE IS DEVELOPMENT GOING UP THAT'S MUCH
20:23:45  DIFFERENT THAN THAT, MOST
20:23:48  RECENTLY, ALONG WALNUT, THERE
20:23:51  ARE OTHER PROPOSALS, COMING IN FROM
20:23:54  RELATIVELY LARGER
PROPERTIES
20:23:58 , YOU KNOW, CORPORATELY OWNED PROPERTIES, LOOKING TO
20:24:01  CREATE A
20:24:04 N APARTMENT DEVELOPMENT THAT REALLY WOULD HAVE BEEN ODD
20:24:08 , COMING IN FIVE OR TEN YEARS AGO,
20:24:11  FROM WHAT WE HAD SEEN AT THE TIME.
IT'S BECOMING
20:24:14  MORE NORMAL FOR THOSE TO BE LOCATED IN AN AREA FRANKLY
20:24:17  FRANKLY NEAR OUR BART STATIONS,
20:24:20  NEAR TRANSIT, AND THAT'S A GOOD SIGN FOR THE VISION
20:24:23  OF  STRATEGICALLY URBAN.
AND THAT GOES TO THE
20:24:27  OTHER POINTS YOU MADE WHICH IS, YOU KNOW, HOW DO WE
20:24:30  DO THIS WHILE KIND OF DOING RIGHT BY THE
20:24:33  COMMUNITY IN TERMS OF NOT 
20:24:36  SHAKING UP SORT OF THE LIVING ENVIRONMENT PEOPLE ARE
USED
20:24:39  TO.
THE STRATEGICALLY URBAN IS THE VISION
20:24:42  TO DO THAT.
ALONG OUR --
20:24:45  THOSE AREAS THAT COURTNEY SHOWED YOU ON THE MAP NEAR
20:24:48  THE BART STATION, AID STATION
20:24:51  ALONG FREMONT BOULEVARD, THE INTENSITY HAS
20:24:55  BEEN SORT OF AUGMENTED, TO ALLOW A VARIETY
20:24:58  OF TYPES OF
PROJECTS AND WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF DEVELOPMENT
20:25:01  PROJECTS COME IN ON THOSE SITES
20:25:04 .
AND
20:25:08  IF YOU DO A LARGER DEVELOPMENT NEAR A BART STATION
20:25:12 , IF YOU LOOK AT THE EQUIVALENT
20:25:16  NUMBER OF UNITS FOR A
20:25:19  SINGLE FAMILY NEIGHBORHOOD ON THE EDGE OF THE CITY, THAT'S A WIN IN TERMS
20:25:22  OF MAKING THOSE
UNITS MORE SUSTAINABLABLE,
20:25:25  MAKING THOSE HAVE BETTER ACCESS TO TRANSIT FOR
20:25:28  THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE THERE, AND ALSO SORT OF FOCUSING
20:25:33  THE INTENSITY IN AN AREA THAT YOU CAN BUILD
20:25:37  THE INFRASTRUCTURE  FOR.
THE OTHER THING YOU MENTIONED
20:25:40 , SMALLER UNITS.
WE DO IN VARIOUS WAYS
20:25:43 , INCENTIVIZE SMALLER UNITS.
WE'VE
20:25:46  SEEN A LOT OF THEM UNDER 700
20:25:49  SQUARE FOOT, WHICH YOU MAY KNOW BECAUSE OF
20:25:52  THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING ORDINANCE, THAT GIVES A DISCOUNT OR A CUT IN THE
20:25:56  RATE.
IT'S HALF THE PRICE FOR THE
20:26:00  AFFORDABLE HOUSING FEE WHEN YOU BUILD A SMALL UNIT
20:26:03  THAT'S AFFORDABLE BY DESIGN UNDER 700 SQUARE
20:26:06  FEET AND THAT'S PART OF THE OBJECTIVE REQUIRING THAT.
I'M SURE
20:26:09  THERE ARE OTHER THINGS WE COULD LOOK INTO TO THINK ABOUT
20:26:13  HOW SMALLER UNITS FIT IN AND
20:26:16  CAN BE INCENTIVIZED.
BUT, YOU KNOW,
20:26:19  THERE IS ALSO A GOAL TO PROVIDE HOUSING FOR ALL TYPES OF
20:26:22  HOUSEHOLDS THROUGHOUT THE CITY.
AND SO I'LL
20:26:26  HAVE TO THANK YOU FOR THE COMMENTS.
>> Commissioner Daulton:  
20:26:29  I THINK THAT WHAT I'M
20:26:32  ENVISIONING IS THAT THERE'S GOING TO HAVE
20:26:35  TO BE ALMOST A SEA CHANGE IN TERMS OF
20:26:39  THE PUBLIC PERCEPTION OF
20:26:42  WHETHER WHAT WE'RE DOING
20:26:46  BY APPROACHING A
STRATEGICALLY URBAN
20:26:49  CITY IS RIGHT
20:26:53 .
AND I THINK A RECENTLY, IN THE
20:26:57  DISCUSSION AND PARTICULARLY THE PUBLIC DISCUSSION,
20:27:01  OF THE CENTERVILLE STREET PLAN, YOU SAW WHAT HAPPENED.
WE HAD
20:27:05  A -- WE HAD A TRIAL PLAN THAT
20:27:08  WAS STRATEGICALLY URBAN, THAT PROMOTED A CERTAIN KIND
20:27:13  OF VISION FOR
20:27:16  DOWNTOWN CENTERVILLE THAT WHEREAS RIGHT IN LINE WITH WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE.
20:27:19 
AND WHAT HAPPENED TO IT?
IT WAS LARGELY SCRAPPED
20:27:23 .
BECAUSE PUBLIC OUT
20:27:26 CRY TURNED THE VOTES IN CITY COUNCIL
20:27:28 .
I MEAN ESSENTIALLY THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED.

20:27:31 SO I THINK ALONG
20:27:35  WITH WHAT IS BEING DONE HERE
20:27:38 , THERE'S GOT TO BE SOME KIND OF REAL MARKETING OF
20:27:41  THIS THING, OR WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THE SAME
20:27:44  PROBLEM.
BECAUSE THE BOTTOM LINE IS,
20:27:47  THE VOTERS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO
20:27:51  CONSISTENTLY TELL MEMBERS OF
20:27:54  CITY COUNCIL WHAT THEY WILL AND WILL NOT ACCEPT.

20:27:58 AND WHAT -- AND SO FAR, THEY'RE NOT
20:28:02  ACCEPTING WHAT THE PLAN IS THAT WELL
20:28:07 .
YOU KNOW?
SO I
20:28:10  -- BECAUSE PUBLIC RELATIONS ISSUE HERE THAT IS VITAL
20:28:14 .
>> Planner Pullen:   I UNDERSTAND YOUR COMMENTS
20:28:17 .
IT'S 8:28, CHAIR.
I WANTED
20:28:20  TO JUST AS A TIME CHECK WE'RE ALMOST DUE FOR
20:28:23  A STENO BREAK.
AND ALSO, THIS IS A
20:28:27  LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN OUR NORMAL ITEMS, THERE'S
20:28:30  NO APPLICANT.
SO WE SORT OF SLID INTO CONVERSATION BEFORE
20:28:33  GETTING THE PUBLIC INFURTHER.
SO WE SHOULD PROBABLY
20:28:36  GIVE THE PUBLIC THE CHANCE TO SPEAK AND MAYBE
20:28:39  DO A BREAK BEFORE THAT OR AFTER THAT.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   OKAY
20:28:43 , TRISH DO YOU WANT TO SET US A TEN MINUTE CLOCK FOR
20:28:46  THE BREAK?
>> YES, WE
20:28:49  WILL DO THAT.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   LET'S DO THAT AND COME
20:28:52  BACK TO PUBLIC COMMENT.
I SAW THAT COMMISSIONER ZHANG
20:28:56  HAD A COMMENT AFTER THAT.
>> Commissioner Zhang:  
20:28:59  WE'LL SKIP THAT.
>> I JUST WANTED TO
20:29:02  REQUIREMENT EVERYBODY APPLIES TURN OFF YOUR VIDEO AND UN
20:29:06 MUTE YOURSELF AND WE'LL SEE YOU IN TEN MINUTES
20:29:09 .
[ RECESS ]
20:41:38 
>> Planner Pullen:   LOOKS LIKE WE'RE ABOUT READY TO GET  STARTED,
20:41:41  WHEN YOU'RE READY, CHAIR
20:41:44 .
>> Commissioner Daulton:   ALL RIGHT THEN, CALLING THIS MEETING BACK TO 
20:41:48 ORDER.
TRISH.
DO WE HAVE ANY PUBLIC SPEAKERS ON THIS 
20:41:52 DISCUSSION ITEM?
>> CHAIRPERSON DAULTON, YES, WE HAVE
20:41:55  ACTUALLY THREE SPEAKERS.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   SO TWO MINUTES, THREE
20:41:58  MINUTES.
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?
THREE MINUTES IS FINE.

20:42:03 >> DID YOU SAY THREE MINUTES?
>> Planner Pullen:   THREE MINUTES IS PINE.

20:42:06 >> THREE MINUTES, OKAY, ALL RIGHT, I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND
20:42:09  INTRODUCE THE FIRST SPEAKER.
KELLY, PLEASE GO AHEAD AND SPEAK
20:42:12  SPEAK.
I'VE ALLOWED YOU TO TALK.

20:42:16 >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
SO PARKING IS A BIG
20:42:19  ISSUE.
BUT STREET PARKING IS OFTEN IGNORED
20:42:23 .
AND STREET PARKING IS UNDER ATTACK BY MOBS OF
20:42:26  NIMBYS ALL OVER THE CITY.
I WOULD POINT YOU
20:42:31  TO TONICA ROAD NEAR SABERCAT TRAIL
20:42:35 , NEAR MISSION SAN JOSE.
THEY HAVE PUT UP VIGILANTE
20:42:39  SIGNS SAYING NO PARKING ON THAT  STREET, THAT'S THE LOCAL
20:42:42  RESIDENTS BECAUSE THEY DON'T LIKE PARK
20:42:45  VISITORS.
RANCHO ARROYO PARKWAY
20:42:48 , THE CITY PUT IN PARKING BECAUSE YOU KNOW THEY HAD SPACE SO
20:42:51  THEY GAVE PEOPLE, THE PEOPLE THAT LIVE IN
20:42:54  THOSE LOW END APARTMENTS, THEY GAVE THEM PARKING.
AND THEN
20:42:57  ALL THE NEIGHBORS GOT MAD BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T WANT ANYBODY PARKING
20:43:01  ON THE STREET.
AND THEY DIDN'T THINK THOSE PEOPLE DESERVED
20:43:04  PARKING.
AND THEN OF COURSE THERE'S THE WY
20:43:07 BEL DRIVE NEAR MISSION PEAK.
THAT IS AMAZINGS.
20:43:10 
THERE ARE NO PEOPLE WHO LIVE ON THAT STREET, NO MAILBOXES
20:43:13 , NO DRIVEWAYS BUT ANGRY MOBS OF
20:43:17  NIMBYS BLOCKED PARKING ON THE ENTIRE
20:43:20  STREET.
SO IT IS ALSO FOR THE CITY
20:43:23  TO -- FOR THE CITY PLANNING DEPARTMENT
20:43:26  SO DISINGENUOUS TO POINT THIS FINGER AT
20:43:30  PRIVATE DEVELOPERS.
I'LL GIVE YOU ONE EXAMPLE
20:43:33 .
NILES GATEWAY.
YOU HAD 100 BIG UNITS
20:43:36  OF FAIRLY BIG DEVELOPMENT OVER THERE AND THAT GOT SLASHED DOWN
20:43:39  TO 75 UNITS OF SMALLER UNITS.
AND YOU
20:43:44  HAD POLITICIANS SAYING THEY WANTED
20:43:47  IT SMALLER THAN 75 UNITS, 60
20:43:50  UNITS, AND THERE WAS A SPLIT ON CITY COUNCIL BECAUSE MANY
20:43:53  POLITICIAN HE THOUGHT THAT NILES GATEWAY WAS TOO BIG.

20:43:56 THE DEVELOPER SAID AND WAS QUOTED IN THE NEWSPAPER AS
20:44:00  SAYING I CAN HONESTLY SAY I'VE NEVER WORKED ON A PROJECT
20:44:03  WHERE I'VE REDUCED THE SIZE AND SCALE OF A PROJECT
20:44:06  MORE.
THAT'S THE TYPICAL FREMONT WAY.
20:44:09 
IT DOESN'T JUST HAPPEN ON SINGLE FAMILY LOTS.

20:44:12 IT HAPPENS EVERYWHERE WHERE THESE DEVELOPERS GET BEAT DOWN AND WE
20:44:16  END UP WITH FEWER UNITS.
THAT'S THE WHOLE
20:44:19  POINT.
THEY TALK ABOUT MASSING, THEY TALK
20:44:22  ABOUT, YOU KNOW, ARTICULATION, THEY TALK ABOUT GOD KNOWS WHAT
20:44:25  AND IT'S ALL DESIGNED TO REDUCE THE SIZE OF
20:44:28  EVERY PROJECT.
I'D ALSO POINT YOU TO
20:44:32 , YOU KNOW, WE'RE SO PROUD OF THE DOWNTOWN.
WE GOT
20:44:35  ONE AND A HALF ACRES AT THE CORNER OF
20:44:38  STEVENSON AND CIVIC CENTER DRIVE.
NEXT
20:44:41  DOOR TO A LIBRARY,
20:44:44  AND A KAISER HOSPITAL, WHY DOES THAT ONE AND A HALF
20:44:48  ACRE LOT HAVE 25 SHIP CONTAIN
20:44:51 ERS ON IT?
IS THAT ZONED FOR SHIPPING CONTAINERS IN
20:44:54  THE MIDDLE OF DOWNTOWN?
ALSO STAFF IS SUGAR
20:44:58  COATING THE SITUATION BY SAYING HALF OF THE
20:45:02  UNITS DON'T MEET RHNA  ALLOCATIONS,
20:45:05  THE TRUTH IS, THAT 3
20:45:08 % MET ALL THE RHNA
20:45:12  TARGETS, OKAY, HARD
20:45:16 LY ANYBODY MEETS THE
RHNA TARGETS.
20:45:19 
HALF ARE BELOW
20:45:22  IN ALL FOUR CATEGORIES.
SO RHNA, FREMONT'S
20:45:25  ACTUALLY DOING NOT BAD WHEN IT COMES TO RHNA WE'LL
20:45:28  SEE IF WE CAN, YOU KNOW, KEEP IT UP.
I'M NOT GOING TO
20:45:32  THROW TOO MANY STONES AT FREMONT FOR NOT MEETING
20:45:36  RHNA BECAUSE WE DID.
THANKS.

20:45:46 >> Commissioner Daulton: TRISH,
20:45:49  YOU WANT TO QUEUE UP ANOTHER SPEAKER?
>> YES
20:45:53 , ONE MOMENT, I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND DO THAT THOUSAND.

20:45:56 I'M ACTUALLY, MARIA, WITH THE TIMER UP, I CAN'T GET
20:46:00  TO THE ATTENDEES TO GIVE
20:46:03  THEM PERMS.
GIVE ME JUST ONE MOMENT AND I'LL DO THAT
20:46:06  NOW.
I JUST NEED TO DO ONE OTHER THING HERE.

20:46:10 OKAY.
SO ONE MOMENT.
THE NEXT SPEAKER IS
20:46:13  LISA.
LISA, GO AHEAD AND SPEAK.
20:46:16 
>> HI, THANK YOU.
I HEARD A LOT
20:46:19  OF TALK IN THIS DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW THE ACTUAL BUILDING IS OUTSIDE
20:46:22  OF YOUR CONTROL.
AND YES, IT IS TRUE THAT THERE ARE FORCE
20:46:25 S OUTSIDE OF YOUR CROALT BUT YOU DO
20:46:28  CONTROL BUT YOU HAVE
20:46:32  BROAD SCOPE TO MAKE IT MORE
20:46:35  FEACIAL AFFORDABLE HOUSING.
SO LET'S DO MORE THAN THE STATUTORY MINIMUM
20:46:38 .
I THINK WE ARE ALL FRUSTRATED HOW FAR WE ARE ON
20:46:42  OUR 2015 TO  2023 NUMBERS
20:46:45  ON THE ALL BUT MEDIAN INCOME
20:46:48 .
I KNOW WE WILL BE PROUD IF WE MEET ALL OUR
20:46:51  NUMBERS IN OUR NEXT CYCLE AND ASK OURSELVES WHAT CAN WE DO
20:46:55  TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN.
TO
20:46:58 TO THAT END, I
20:47:01  APPRECIATE COMMISSIONER DAULTON'S COMMENTS
20:47:05 , IN ORDER TO INCREASE THE PROBABILITY OF MIGHTING OUR NUMBERS.
I
20:47:08  HOPE YOU CONSIDER THESE AND OTHER BOWLED
20:47:12  OTHER BOLD
20:47:15  MOVES, AS WE CAN BE PROUD OF
20:47:19  FREMONT AS A CITY THAT BUILDS FOR ALL
20:47:24  INCOMES.
THANK YOU.
>> OKAY
20:47:27  LISA THANK YOU.
I'LL GO AHEAD AND INTRODUCE
20:47:30  THE NEXT SPEAKER.
THE NEXT SPEAKER IS KATHERINE.

20:47:34 KATHERINE GO AHEAD AND SPEAK.
>> HI, I
20:47:37  JUST WANTED TO MAKE THREE
20:47:40  QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS.
FIRST, I WANT TO
20:47:43  KNOW, IF HABITAT FOR HUMANITY IS
20:47:47  BEING TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION
20:47:50  FOR THE PLANNING ON ALL OF THIS, HOW
20:47:54  IT FITS INTO ALL OF THIS.
NUMBER 2 IS, MY MOST
20:47:57  IMPORTANT QUESTION, AND THAT IS,
20:48:00  THE LOW INCOME OR AFFORDABLE HOUSING CONTRACTORS DO
20:48:03  NOT SEEM TO HAVE OVERSIGHT.
20:48:06 
AND WHEN PROBLEMS ARISE
20:48:11  FOR APPLICANTS FOR
20:48:14  THOSE PARTICULAR
20:48:17  HOMES, THERE DOES NOT SEEM TO BE AN
20:48:20  ENTITY IN WHICH SOMEBODY CAN SEEK REDRESS OR
20:48:23  EVEN AN AUDIT
20:48:27  TO
20:48:30  SEE IF THESE CONTRACTORS ARE WITHIN
COMPLIANCE
20:48:33  OF STATE LAW OR TO
20:48:36  FIND IF THERE ARE ANY
20:48:41  CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH LOW INCOME PEOPLE ARE BEING TAKEN ADVANTAGE
20:48:45  OF WHILE KIND OF
20:48:50  SKIRTING THE LAW.
AND I JUST KIND OF WANT TO MAKE
20:48:53  SURE THAT THIS IS A PROBLEM THAT
20:48:56  NEEDS TO BE MADE AWARE OF
20:48:59  AND ADDRESSED.
AND MY THIRD
20:49:02  AND FINAL COMMENT WAS, THERE WAS A CONCERN RAISED ABOUT
20:49:05  BIKING LANES.
FROM MY
20:49:08  PERSPECTIVE, I THINK BIKING LANES ARE A GREAT IDEA
20:49:12 .
HOWEVER, WHAT HAPPENED IN THE BIKE
20:49:17 ING LANE CHANGES WAS THAT THERE DID NOT SEEM TO BE
20:49:20  ANY SIGNAGE THAT WARNED DRIVERS
20:49:23  OF THOSE UPCOMING PROJECTS
20:49:26 .
AND THE CHANGES WERE CONFUSING BECAUSE
20:49:30  THE LANES WERE THE
20:49:33  WHERE THE RIGHT TURNS USED TO BE
20:49:36  WERE STILL WIDE ENOUGH FOR A CAR TO FIT INTO IN THE REACHING
20:49:40  THE CORNER WHICH MAY HAVE CREATED SOME
TRAFFIC
20:49:43  ISSUES, IF NOT ACCIDENTS.
SO THOSE
20:49:47  KINDS OF THINGS ALSO YOU NEED TO BE AWARE OF TOO
20:49:50 .
I THINK THAT THOSE KINDS OF
20:49:53  THINGS DO CREATE SOME OF THOSE SITUATIONS FOR
20:49:56  WHERE PEOPLE ARE  UNHAPPY WITH THOSE
20:50:00  PROBLEMS OR SITUATIONS.
SO I
20:50:04  CLOSE AND HOPE THAT THESE KINDS OF QUESTIONS WILL
20:50:08  BE ADDRESSED.
THANK YOU.

20:50:13 >> Commissioner Daulton:   IS THAT OUR LAST SPEAKER TRISH?
20:50:17 
>> THAT IS LAST SPEAKER, YES.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   THEN IN 
20:50:20 THAT CASE I'D LIKE TO BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMISSION AND SEE
20:50:23  IF THERE ARE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FOR STAFF
20:50:28 .
DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT.

20:50:32 I WOULD JUST SAY, IN TEMPS OF KATHERINE
20:50:35 'S LAST QUESTION, I THINK,
20:50:38  SOMEHOW, MAYBE THERE COULD HAVE
20:50:42  BEEN A BETTER MARKETING OF THE BIKE LANES.
I DON'T KNOW
20:50:45 .
SOMETHING WENT, SEEMS TO HAVE GONE
20:50:49  WRONG BECAUSE WE SEEM TO HAVE LIKE A VERY
20:50:52  BOISTEROUS OPPOSITION TO BIKE LANES IN FREMONT.
AND I
20:50:55  TELL YOU AS A CYCLIST IT IS UNNERVING
20:50:58  TO HEAR HOW PISSED
20:51:02  OFF PEOPLE ARE ABOUT BIKE LANES.
I
20:51:05  THINK, I SAW TODAY WHEN I WAS DRIVING HOME
20:51:08  FROM PICKING UP MY DAUGHTER, I SAW SEVERAL PEOPLE WHO
20:51:12  WERE OBVIOUSLY COMMUTING ON THEIR BICYCLE, HEADED
20:51:15  FOR BART, AND THE MORE
20:51:19  OF THOSE PEOPLE WE CAN GET,
SPANDEX OR NO, THE MORE PEOPLE
20:51:23  ARE GOING TO GET USED TO IT AND THE BETTER IT IS GOING
20:51:26  TO BE FOR THE CYCLING COMMUNITY HERE AND FOR THE WHOLE
20:51:29  CITY, SO I DON'T KNOW --
>> Planner Pullen:   WE'LL ADD THAT ON TO
20:51:32  OUR COLLEAGUES IN PUBLIC WORKS, THE COMMENTS WE'VE HEARD
20:51:36 .
>> Commissioner Daulton:   THANK YOU.
ANYBODY ELSE
20:51:39 ?
IN THAT CASE, I GUESS I'LL JUST END
20:51:42  THIS ITEM, THERE'S NO VOTE ON THIS RIGHT JOEL
20:51:45 ?
OR --
>> Planner Pullen:   NO
20:51:49 .
THE RECOMMENDATION TONIGHT IS DO EXACTLY WHAT
20:51:52  DID YOU WHICH IS TO PROVIDE US FEEDBACK AND WE GOT
20:51:56  QUITE A FEW OF YOUR COMMENTS AND WE'LL TAKE THOSE INTO
20:51:59  ACCOUNT, THE HOUSING ELEMENT TEAM IS ASSEMBLING
20:52:02 
THOSE AND CONSIDERING ALL OF IT AS THEY
20:52:05  CRACK THIS  NUT.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   ALL RIGHT, IN THIS CASE WE'LL MOVE
20:52:08  ON TO MISCELLANEOUS ITEMS.
20:52:11 
STAFF UPDATES OF ANY SORT JOEL?
>> Planner Pullen:   I WANTED TO
20:52:14  GIVE AN UPDATE TO THE COMMISSION TO ITEMS THAT WENT
20:52:19  TO THE COUNCIL THAT YOU SAW.
THE HOUSING ELEMENT
20:52:22  ANNUAL PROGRESS REPORT CONNECTED TO THE LAST HOUSING ELEMENT
20:52:25  DID GET REVIEWED AND ACCEPTED BY COUNCIL AND THAT GOT SENT
20:52:28  OFF TO THE STATE HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT
20:52:32  AND
OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH.
AND SO WE ARE COMPLIANT
20:52:35  FOR THIS YEAR'S ANNUAL REPORTING AFTER YOU SAW
20:52:38  THAT IN FEBRUARY.
AND THEN ALSO,
20:52:41  THE SCANNELL PROJECT THAT YOU SAW IN FEBRUARY WAS REVIEWED
20:52:45  AND THE GENERAL PLAN AMENDMENT WAS APPROVED AND
20:52:50  THE ORDINANCE WAS INTRODUCED BY COUNCIL
20:52:53  AS OF THE 15th OF MARCH AS WELL.
THAT CONCLUDES
20:52:56  THOSE UPDATES.
I UNDERSTAND THAT SOME OF THE COMMISSIONERS ALSO ATTEND
20:52:59 ED THE
20:53:03  LEAGUE OF CITIES PLANNING COMMISSION
20:53:08 ERS ACADEMY AND GAVE ME
20:53:11  SOME FEEDBACK AND MIGHT ALSO HAVE A REPORT OUT ON THAT
20:53:14 .
>> Commissioner Daulton:   OKAY SO DO WE HAVE ANY INFORMATION OR
20:53:17  ANYTHING TO SHARE FROM OUR COMMISSIONERS TONIGHT WITH THE REST OF THE COMMISSION
20:53:20  AND  STAFF?
ANYONE?

20:53:26 OH, COMMISSIONER YEE.
>> Commissioner Yee:   YES,
20:53:29  I WAS ONE OF THE THREE COMMISSIONERS, COMMISSIONER LIU
20:53:34 , COMMISSIONER ZHANG AND MYSELF ATTENDED THE
20:53:37  PLANNING  COMMISSIONERS ACADEMY LAST WEEK, THREE DAY
20:53:40  EVENT UP
THERE IN SAN RAMON SO IT WAS OUR TURN
20:53:44  IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA TO BE THE HOST, NEXT YEAR IT WILL BE
20:53:48  IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.
AS YOU PROBABLY HEARD THEY HAD
20:53:51  QUITE A BIT OF DISCUSSION ABOUT SB 9.
WE HAD ABOUT I
20:53:54  BELIEVE 330 PLANNING COMMISSIONERS FROM AROUND THE STATE
20:53:58  ACTUALLY ATTEND THIS PARTICULAR ACADEMY.
SO IT WAS KIND OF I GUESS IT
20:54:01  WAS PLEASANT, AND AT THE SAME TIME, NERVE WRACKING AT THE SAME TIME
20:54:05 .
BECAUSE TO SEE SO MANY PEOPLE,
20:54:08  MASK OR NO MASK, MASK OR NO  MASK, YOU KNOW WITH
20:54:11  THAT MANY PEOPLE IN ONE LARGE ROOM.
BUT ONE
20:54:14  THING I DO WANT TO SHARE IS, ONE
20:54:18  OF THE -- THERE'S A SENATE BILL,
20:54:21  THAT'S BEING  DRAFTED AND
20:54:25  BEING SENT BY STATE SENATOR
20:54:28  BOB WIECKOWSKI, AND  LOOKING AT INCREASING THE HEIGHT
20:54:31  OF THE
ADUS FROM THE CURRENT HEIGHT OF 16 FEET TO
20:54:35  25 FEET.
SO THAT HE'S LOOKING
20:54:38  TO PROVIDE A BILL SO THAT ADUS
20:54:41  CAN BE TWO STORIES IN HEIGHT.
SO I JUST WANTED TO SHARE THAT
20:54:46  WITH THE REST OF THE COMMISSION.
>> Commissioner Daulton:  
20:54:49  WOW.

20:54:58  MEETING AND THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR PARTICIPATION
