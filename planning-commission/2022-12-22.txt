GOOD EVENING

[Captioner] 19:12:11
GOOD EVENING, PLANNING COMMISSION, TONIGHT

[Captioner] 19:12:14
 STAFF HAS PRODUCED A DRAF ON THE HOUSING

[Captioner] 19:12:18
 ELEMENT UPDATE WHICH GIVEN IS AN EIGHT YEAR PLAN TO MOVE THE HOUSING

[Captioner] 19:12:21
 NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY.
THIS ADOPTION

[Captioner] 19:12:24
 DRAFT BEFORE YOU THIS EVENING IS THE CLUDGES

[Captioner] 19:12:28
 CULMINATION OF

[Captioner] 19:12:31
 MANY MONTHS OF TECHNICAL ANALYSIS

[Captioner] 19:12:34
 AND COLLABORATION OF REGIONAL AND STATE

[Captioner] 19:12:38
 PARTNERS, HC

[Captioner] 19:12:41
B TO

[Captioner] 19:12:46
 HOUSING ELEMENT LAW.

[Captioner] 19:12:49

THE PLANNING DEPARTMENT HAS COME

[Captioner] 19:12:52
 BEFORE THE PLANNING COMMISSIONS IN JULY 2021 AND

[Captioner] 19:12:56
 AGAIN ON TWRI 22 TO SEEK DEVELOPMENT

[Captioner] 19:12:59
 OF THE HOUSING ELEMENT.
KNIT

[Captioner] 19:13:03
'S PRESENTATION DIFFERS IN THAT WE ARE REQUESTING THAT THE PLANNING COMMISSION

[Captioner] 19:13:06
 MAKE A FORMAL RECOMMENDATION ON ADOPTION OF

[Captioner] 19:13:09
 THE DRAFT HOUSING ELEMENT TO THE CITY COUNCIL TONIGHT.


[Captioner] 19:13:18
THIS SLIDE HAS A QUICK OVERVIEW OF

[Captioner] 19:13:21
 OUR PLENGTS.
HOUSING UPDATE PROCESS

[Captioner] 19:13:25
 INCLUDING HOW WE GET TO THIS POINT AND WHAT LIES

[Captioner] 19:13:28
 AHEAD.
WE WILL ALSO REVIEW SOME

[Captioner] 19:13:31
 HIGHLIGHTS AND FINALLY DISCUSS THE CHANGES

[Captioner] 19:13:34
 THAT THE HOUSING DEPARTMENT HAS MADE

[Captioner] 19:13:37
 TO THE ELEMENT IN ORDER TO

[Captioner] 19:13:42
 GET COMMENTS FROM THE PUBLIC

[Captioner] 19:13:45
 AND HCD.
UNDER STATE LAW

[Captioner] 19:13:48
, CITIES AND COUNTIES OF CALIFORNIA ARE REQUIRED

[Captioner] 19:13:52
 TO PLAN FOR THE COMMUNITY

[Captioner] 19:13:55
, AS SEARCH MANDATORY

[Captioner] 19:13:58
 ELEMENTS OF THE JEOPARDY.
IT IS DIFFERENT IN

[Captioner] 19:14:02
 OTHER ELEMENTS IN THAT IT'S REQUIRED TO BE UPDATE

[Captioner] 19:14:05
ED EVERY EIGHT YEARS AND SUBJECT TO APPROVAL BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

[Captioner] 19:14:08
 TO ENSURE THAT IT IS IN ALIGNMENT WITH THE STATE'S HOUSING
GOALS.

[Captioner] 19:14:11

NOW RECEIVING THE CERTIFICATION FROM THE STATE IS SOMETHING THAT HAS

[Captioner] 19:14:14
 BECOME INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT SINCE THE LAST TIME WE

[Captioner] 19:14:17
 ADOPTED A HOUSING ELEMENT BACK IN 2015

[Captioner] 19:14:21
.
IF WE TAKE A LOOK BACK IN TIME AT THESE

[Captioner] 19:14:24
 LAST EIGHT YEARS WHAT WE SAW WAS THE STATE'S HOUSING

[Captioner] 19:14:27
 CRISIS BECOME MORE PRONOUNCED.
HOUSING

[Captioner] 19:14:30
 BECOME MORE  UNAFFORDABLE.
RATES OF HOME

[Captioner] 19:14:34
LESSNESS INCREASE AND WE SAW DISPARITIES IN ACCESS TO HOUSING

[Captioner] 19:14:37
 IN OUR COMMUNITIES BECOME MORE CURRENT

[Captioner] 19:14:40
.
NOW STATE LEGISLATURE RESPONDS TO THIS CRISIS

[Captioner] 19:14:43
 IN A VARIETY OF WAYS AND THEN INCLUDED THE APPROVAL

[Captioner] 19:14:47
 OF LEGISLATION PLACING MORE REQUIREMENTS ON THE HOUSING

[Captioner] 19:14:50
 ELEMENTS.
THESE CHANGES INCLUDE

[Captioner] 19:14:53
 ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS TO AFFIRMATIVELY

[Captioner] 19:14:56
 FURTHER AND FAIR HOUSING AND ALSO MORE RULES AND MORE EXPECTATION

[Captioner] 19:14:59
S, WITH REGARDS TO DEMONSTRATING IT

[Captioner] 19:15:03
 HAS ADEQUATE CAPACITY TO MEET ITS
HOUSING

[Captioner] 19:15:07
 NEEDS.
MANY JURISDICTIONS IN THE STATE HAVE FOUND

[Captioner] 19:15:10
 IT DIFFICULT TO MEET THESE NEW REQUIREMENTS.
IF WE

[Captioner] 19:15:13
 LOOK AT THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA REGION THEIR

[Captioner] 19:15:17
 HOUSING ELEMENTS WERE DUE MORE THAN A YEAR AGO AND YET A

[Captioner] 19:15:20
 HUGE NUMBER OF THOSE CITIES STILL DON'T HAVE

[Captioner] 19:15:24
 A CERTIFIED HOUSING ELEMENT A YEAR LATER.
AND ONE

[Captioner] 19:15:27
 OF THE CRITICAL AREAS WHERE JURISDICTIONS

[Captioner] 19:15:30
 HAVE STRUGGLED IS TO IDENTIFY LAND TO MEET FUTURE HOUSING

[Captioner] 19:15:34
 NEEDS IN THE JURISDICTION, IN A

[Captioner] 19:15:37
 PROCESS NEEDS KNOWN

[Captioner] 19:15:40
 AS RHNA

[Captioner] 19:15:43
.
BASED ON HOW HOUSING NEEDS ARE NOW CALCULATED

[Captioner] 19:15:46
 REGIONS NOW FACE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGH

[Captioner] 19:15:50
ER RHNA TARGETS THAN IN PREVIOUS

[Captioner] 19:15:53
 CYCLES.
IN FACT

[Captioner] 19:15:56
 THE CALCULATED NEED FOR THE BAY AREA IS MORE THAN

[Captioner] 19:15:59
 TWICE WHAT IT WAS IN THE PREVIOUS CYCLE

[Captioner] 19:16:02
.
FREMONT'S NEED IS 12,

[Captioner] 19:16:06
897 NEW HOUSING HITS, WHEREAS IT WAS

[Captioner] 19:16:09
 ONLY 8

[Captioner] 19:16:13
,455 IN THE

[Captioner] 19:16:16
 PREVIOUS  CYCLE.
IT IS BROKEN DOWN

[Captioner] 19:16:20
 INTO VARIOUS DESIGNATIONS

[Captioner] 19:16:24
, INCLUDING LOW INCOME.


[Captioner] 19:16:34
2011 GENERAL PLAN HOUSING PROCESS HAS FOCUSED MORE ON

[Captioner] 19:16:38
 THE VERY CRITICAL QUESTION

[Captioner] 19:16:41
 OF HOW DO WE PROMOTE HOUSING PRODUCTION

[Captioner] 19:16:45
 PARTICULARLY AFFORDABLE HOUSING PRODUCTION THROUGH
OUR ACTION

[Captioner] 19:16:48
 ACTIONABLE POLICIES AND  PROGRAMS.


[Captioner] 19:17:04
HOUSING IS A FEDERATE

[Captioner] 19:17:08
 MUCH CRITICAL ITEM FOR EVERYONE IN THE COMMUNITY AND CREATING OPPORTUNITIES

[Captioner] 19:17:11
 FOR EVERYONE IN THE COMMUNITY TO BE HEARD AND TO BE RESPONDED TO.


[Captioner] 19:17:14
AND THAT CAME WITH AN EXIST GOING

[Captioner] 19:17:17
 ON WITH THE COMMUNITY TO REACH PEOPLE

[Captioner] 19:17:21
 IN THE GREATEST NEEDS FOR HOUSING, LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS, THOSE

[Captioner] 19:17:24
 WITH SPECIAL HOUSING NEEDS AND ALSO THE  UNHOUSED.


[Captioner] 19:17:28
OUR HOUSING ELEMENT ENGAGEMENT PROCESS IT REALLY KICKED

[Captioner] 19:17:31
 INTO HIGH GEAR AT THE VERY BEGINNING OF THIS

[Captioner] 19:17:34
 YEAR WHEN STAFF WENTEN A TOUR OF THE

[Captioner] 19:17:37

 AND TO COLLECT FEEDBACK FROM

[Captioner] 19:17:47
 THEIR UNIQUE PERSPECTIVES AND THE MISSIONS OF

[Captioner] 19:17:50
 EACH BOARD.
WE UNDERTOOK A

[Captioner] 19:17:54
 MULTIPRONGED EFFORT WHICH INCLUDED OFFICE

[Captioner] 19:17:57
 HOURS WHERE PEOPLE COULD CONVENIENTLY SCHEDULE TIME TO

[Captioner] 19:18:00
 TALK WITH HOUSING ELEMENT TEAM AND WE ATTENDED COMMUNITY

[Captioner] 19:18:04
  EVENTS, HELD FOCUS
GROUPS WITH DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS AND

 AROUND SENT FEEDBACK TO THE CITY'S

[Captioner] 19:18:19
 REGULAR COMMUNICATION CHANNELS AND THROUGH THIS VARIOUS FEEDBACK

[Captioner] 19:18:23
 WE IDENTIFIED CHIEF
THEMES, MAPPED OUT POTENTIAL ACTION

[Captioner] 19:18:26
ABLE ITEMS AND WE CONNECTED THOSE BACK TO

[Captioner] 19:18:29
 THOSE THEMES OF COMMUNICATION AND THIS ALL CLIMENTED

SO FIRST OF ALL IN THE GOALS

[Captioner] 19:23:33
 POLICIES AND PROGRAMS CHAPTER STAFF HAVE MADE

[Captioner] 19:23:37
 EDITS THAT STRENGTHENED PROPOSED PROGRAMS TO

[Captioner] 19:23:40

[Captioner] 19:23:43
 TO ADDITIONAL ACTIONS.
STAFF ADDED LOCALITY CONTEXT

[Captioner] 19:23:46
 REGARDING THE GEOGRAPHIC IMPACTS OF CERTAIN FAIR

[Captioner] 19:23:49
 HOUSING  POLICIES.
FOR EXAMPLE, STAFF

[Captioner] 19:23:52
 CLARIFIED THAT A POLICY TO ALLOW RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT IN

[Captioner] 19:23:57
 CERTAIN COMMERCIAL DISTRICTS CONSISTENT WITH THE STATE LAW

[Captioner] 19:24:00
 SB 478 WOULD LARGELY HAVE THE INCREASE

[Captioner] 19:24:04
 OF AFFECTING
RESIDENTIAL DENSITY WITHIN

[Captioner] 19:24:07
 EXISTING ISLANDS OF COMMERCIAL ZONING WITHIN ESTABLISHED

[Captioner] 19:24:10
 SINGLE FAMILY RESIDENTIAL  NEIGHBORHOODS.
AREAS WITH THE HIGHEST

[Captioner] 19:24:13
 AMOUNT OF OPPORTUNITY.

[Captioner] 19:24:16

STAFF ADDITIONALLY MODIFIED CERTAIN PROGRAMS TO DEVELOP

[Captioner] 19:24:19
 CONCRETE TIME LINES, OBJECTIVES AND COMMITMENTS

[Captioner] 19:24:22
.
FOR EXAMPLE, PROGRAM 33 WAS

[Captioner] 19:24:38
 SIMILARLY MODIFIED IN RESPONSE TO COMMENTS FROM HCD IN

[Captioner] 19:24:41

[Captioner] 19:24:44
ED TO APPLYING FOR STATE FINANCING RESOURCES FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING

[Captioner] 19:24:47

FINALLY,

[Captioner] 19:24:51
 STAFF STRENGTHENED THE CITY'S COMMITMENTS ON A NUMBER OF KEY PROGRAMS

[Captioner] 19:24:54
.
PROGRAM 63 WHICH IS REGARDING THE

[Captioner] 19:24:57
 DEVELOPMENT OF HOUSING ON PUBLIC LANDS INCLUDING THE FREMONT

[Captioner] 19:25:00

[Captioner] 19:25:03
 SPECIFIC PLAN OF ACTION IN ORDER TO FACILITATE

[Captioner] 19:25:06
 DEVELOPMENT AT
THAT SITE.
PROGRAM

[Captioner] 19:25:10
 69 WHICH AIMS TO EXPAND HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES

[Captioner] 19:25:13
 FOR DISABLED PEOPLE, NOW PROPOSES

[Captioner] 19:25:16
 MULTIPLE INCREMENTAL ZONING CLEANUP ITEMS THAT

[Captioner] 19:25:19
 WILL REMOVE BEAR USERS TO ACCESSIBLE HOUSING AND

[Captioner] 19:25:23
 REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION

[Captioner] 19:25:26
S CONSISTENT WITH THE FAIR HOUSING ACT.
THE ADOPTION

[Captioner] 19:25:29
 ACT ALSO CONTAINS ADDITIONAL DETAILS WITHIN THE

[Captioner] 19:25:32
 CONDESCRAINT ANALYSIS CHAPTER.

[Captioner] 19:25:35

 THE HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY ACT.
IN RESPONSE

[Captioner] 19:25:46
 TO PUBLIC FEEDBACK AND COMMENTS FROM HCD STAFF

[Captioner] 19:25:49
 ALSO EXPANDED OUR ANALYSIS OF POTENTIAL INFRASTRUCTURE

[Captioner] 19:25:52
 CONSTRAINTS.
SO FOR EXAMPLE, IF STAFF ADDED

[Captioner] 19:25:55
 ANNAL ANALYSIS OF THE POTENTIAL COST THAT DEVELOPERS

[Captioner] 19:25:58
 MUST  UNDERTAKE IN ORDER TO

[Captioner] 19:26:02
 CONSTRUCT STREET IMPROVEMENTS SUCH AS STREETS GUTTERS

[Captioner] 19:26:05
 AND SIDEWALKS ALONG A
DEVELOPMENT PROJECT.
ADDITIONAL DETAIL WAS ALSO

[Captioner] 19:26:09
 ADDED REGARDING THE CITY'S GENERAL PLAN

[Captioner] 19:26:12
 ANNUAL PROGRESS REPORTING WHICH IS USED TO MAINTAIN

[Captioner] 19:26:15
 GENERAL PLAN CONSISTENCY THROUGHOUT THE PLANNING PERIOD.


[Captioner] 19:26:19
LASTLY, ADDITIONAL COMMENTS WERE ADDED TO THE

[Captioner] 19:26:22
 CITY'S FAIR HOUSING ANALYSIS CHAPTER IN ORDER TO

[Captioner] 19:26:25
 COMPLY WITH STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS.

[Captioner] 19:26:28

A MATRIX NOTING STAFF'S RESPONSES

[Captioner] 19:26:54
 TO HCD'S PARTICULAR COMMENTS HAS BEEN INCLUDED IN THE

[Captioner] 19:26:58
 STAFF REPORT BEFORE YOU TONIGHT AND RESULTANTLY

[Captioner] 19:27:01
 STAFF BELIEVE THAT THE ADOPTION DRAFT IS

[Captioner] 19:27:04
 IN SUBSTANTIAL
CONFORMANCE WITH

[Captioner] 19:27:08
 STATE

[Captioner] 19:27:11
 HOUSING ELEMENT LAW.
THEREFORE, STAFF

[Captioner] 19:27:14
'S RECOMMENDATION FOR TONIGHT IS TO HOLD A PUBLIC HEARING, FIND

[Captioner] 19:27:17
 THAT THE 2023 THROUGH

[Captioner] 19:27:21
 20

[Captioner] 19:27:26
32, ADOPT THE 2023 THROUGH 20

[Captioner] 19:27:29
31 HOUSING ELEMENT ADOPTION DRAFT .


[Captioner] 19:27:33
STAFF'S RECOMMENDATION IS THAT THE PLANNING COMMISSION ADDITIONALLY

[Captioner] 19:27:37
 FINDS THE HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATE IS EXEMPT

[Captioner] 19:27:40
 FROM ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW PURSUANT TO THE

[Captioner] 19:27:43
 CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT, A
CHECKLIST DEMONSTRATING THE

[Captioner] 19:27:46
 PROJECT'S ELIGIBILITY FOR A 151

[Captioner] 19:27:50
83 EXEMPTION IS INCLUDED AS EXHIBIT B IN YOUR PACKET TONIGHT.


[Captioner] 19:27:55
THAT CONCLUDES OUR PRESENTATION THIS EVENING AND WE'RE NOW AVAILABLE FOR

[Captioner] 19:27:58
 ANY QUESTIONS THAT COMMISSIONERS HAVE AT THIS TIME.


[Captioner] 19:28:02
>> Commissioner Daulton:   THANK YOU, COURTNEY

[Captioner] 19:28:06
 AND WAYLAND.
>> CHAIRPERSON I

[Captioner] 19:28:10
 MIGHT BRIEFLY ADD THAT BEFORE

[Captioner] 19:28:13
 THE MEETING WE PROVIDED THE PLANNING COMMISSION WITH

[Captioner] 19:28:16
 NOTES AND CORRECTIONS AND RESPONDED TO TWO ADDITIONAL LETTERS

[Captioner] 19:28:19
 THAT WE RECEIVED FROM THE PUBLIC, THAT
WAS PROVIDED

[Captioner] 19:28:22
 TO THE COMMISSION BEFORE THE MEETING.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   OKAY, THANK YOU WAYLAND.


[Captioner] 19:28:27
SO COMMISSIONERS.
DO YOU HAVE CLARIFYING QUESTIONS FOR

[Captioner] 19:28:30
 STAFF ON THIS ITEM?

[Captioner] 19:28:36

I SEE COMMISSIONER YEE,

[Captioner] 19:28:40
 PLEASE.
>> Commissioner Yee:   YES, THANK YOU CHAIR

[Captioner] 19:28:43
.
I HAD A CHANCE TO THOROUGHLY GO

[Captioner] 19:28:46
 THROUGH THIS NOW IT'S A 540 PAGE DOCUMENT

[Captioner] 19:28:50
, ORIGINALLY IT WAS 541.


[Captioner] 19:28:53
I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHERE WAS THE ONE PAGE MISSING

[Captioner] 19:28:56
?
I DON'T WANT TO READ THE WHOLE THING OVER AGAIN TRYING

[Captioner] 19:28:59
 TO FIGURE THAT ONE OUT.
BUT ALSO, I KNOW THAT, YOU KNOW,

[Captioner] 19:29:02
 ONE OF THE FEW CITIES THAT'S IN ALAMEDA COUNTY,

[Captioner] 19:29:06
 THAT ACTUALLY HAS THEIR HOUSING

[Captioner] 19:29:09
 ELEMENT REPORT ALREADY PASSED BY HCD

[Captioner] 19:29:12
 AS ALAMEDA, SO MY QUESTION TO STAFF

[Captioner] 19:29:16
 STAFF, HOW
MUCH CONTACT HAS OUR STAFF

[Captioner] 19:29:19
 SPOKEN TO ALAMEDA'S STAFFS SINCE

[Captioner] 19:29:22
 THEIRS WAS THE FIRST AND ONLY ONE THAT'S ALREADY PASSED?


[Captioner] 19:29:29

>> Planner Pullen:   LET ME START WITH THAT AND I'M

[Captioner] 19:29:32
 SURE THE TEAM CAN ADD ON TO IT.
BUT I KNOW

[Captioner] 19:29:35
 AND WENT TO SCHOOL WITH THE -- ONE OF THE KEY PEOPLE

[Captioner] 19:29:38
 IN ALAMEDA THERE AND

[Captioner] 19:29:41
 MEET WITH THEM MONTHLY AS PART OF A REGIONAL

[Captioner] 19:29:45
 SORT OF GROUP OF PLANNING MANAGERS.

[Captioner] 19:29:48

AND I'M AWARE OF THEIR EARLY PASSAGE

[Captioner] 19:29:51
 OF THE HOUSING ELEMENT, THAT'S BEEN A REALLY GOOD STORY

[Captioner] 19:29:55
 FOR THEIR COMMUNITY.
THERE ARE CERTAIN FACTORS THAT LED TO

[Captioner] 19:29:58
 THAT, THAT ARE MORE NUMEROUS FOR US TO COVER OVER A

[Captioner] 19:30:01
 MEETING LIKE THIS.
BUT YET THEY'VE DONE A VERY GOOD

[Captioner] 19:30:04
 JOB.
AND THERE ARE A LOT OF JURISDICTIONS THAT ARE

[Captioner] 19:30:07
 BEHIND THEM AROUND HERE FOR VARIOUS REASONS

[Captioner] 19:30:10
.
SO WE HAVE -- WE KEEP IN TOUCH WITH

[Captioner] 19:30:15
 OUR REGIONAL COUNTERPARTS AND UNDERSTAND WHAT'S

[Captioner] 19:30:18
 GOING ON IN GENERAL.
>> Commissioner Yee:   OKAY THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 19:30:21

>> I'LL ALSO ADD THAT --
>> Commissioner Yee: 

[Captioner] 19:30:24
  GO AHEAD.
>> ALSO ADD THAT WE FORMED WHAT WE CALL

[Captioner] 19:30:28
 THE HOUSING ELEMENT COLLABORATIVE WITH OTHER CITIES IN ALAMEDA COUNTY

[Captioner] 19:30:31
.
AND

[Captioner] 19:30:35
 THROUGH THAT PROCESS WE SHARE A LOT OF EXPERIENCES NOTES AND

[Captioner] 19:30:38
 LESSONS LEARNED WITH EACH OTHER, WHICH HELPS GUIDE US

[Captioner] 19:30:41
 THROUGH PROCESS.
ALSO, IT IS

[Captioner] 19:30:45
 QUITE IMPRESSIVE THAT ALAMEDA

[Captioner] 19:30:48
 WAS ABLE TO GET THAT RECOGNITION EARLY ON IN THE PROCESS

[Captioner] 19:30:51
.
IT'S A CREDIT TO THEM.
>> Commissioner Yee:   RIGHT, YEAH

[Captioner] 19:30:54
, BECAUSE I HAD A

[Captioner] 19:30:57
 CHANCE TO ALSO READ THEIR REPORT, YOU KNOW, OURS

[Captioner] 19:31:00
 IS 540 PAGES.
THEIRS IS -- IN

[Captioner] 19:31:04
 TWO SECTIONS,  338 PAGES.
MY QUESTION

[Captioner] 19:31:07
 IS, I NOTICED THAT, YOU KNOW,

[Captioner] 19:31:10
 WAYLAND, YOU HAD MADE MENTIONED THAT HC

[Captioner] 19:31:13
D REALLY LIKED THE FEEDBACK

[Captioner] 19:31:16
 OF ALL THE INFORMATION THAT WAS SUBMITTED TO THEM

[Captioner] 19:31:20
 FROM THE PUBLIC.
BUT MY QUESTION IS THAT, IS IT

[Captioner] 19:31:23
 REALLY NECESSARY TO HAVE EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THE

[Captioner] 19:31:27
 SLIDES PRESENTED FROM ALL THE DIFFERENT COMMISSIONS AND COMMITTEES INCLUDING

[Captioner] 19:31:30
 THE CITY COUNCIL, BECAUSE SO MANY OF THE
SLIDES ARE VERY SIMILAR

[Captioner] 19:31:33
.
I'M JUST WONDERING IS THERE A WAY TO KIND OF STREAMLINE

[Captioner] 19:31:36
 THAT A LITTLE BIT?
BECAUSE THAT'S LIKE 40 PAGES.


[Captioner] 19:31:39
YOU KNOW?
AND I UNDERSTAND THAT WE NEED TO SHOW THAT.


[Captioner] 19:31:42
BUT I'M NOT SURE IF WE NEED TO SHOW EVERY SINGLE

[Captioner] 19:31:45
 SLIDE.
IT'S ALMOST LIKE OVER AND OVER AGAIN

[Captioner] 19:31:50
.
>> I WOULD AGREE WITH THAT

[Captioner] 19:31:53
, THAT IT IS A LOT OF INFORMATION TO HAVE IN A

[Captioner] 19:31:56
 LARGE POLICY DOCUMENT SUCH AS THIS.
I DO

[Captioner] 19:32:00
 THINK THE EXERCISE

[Captioner] 19:32:03
 OF THIS

[Captioner] 19:32:06
 HOUSING ELEMENT APPROVAL

[Captioner] 19:32:09
 PROCESS HINGES A LOT ON SHOWING YOUR WORK.


[Captioner] 19:32:12
BECAUSE IT DOES REQUIRE THE STATE'S APPROVAL

[Captioner] 19:32:16
.
SO INCLUDING ALL INFORMATION DOES

[Captioner] 19:32:19
 HELP SUPPORT OUR DOCUMENT FOR THAT REVIEW PROCESS

[Captioner] 19:32:22
.
AND WE DID FOLLOW THE LEAD OF OTHER CITIES THAT

[Captioner] 19:32:26
 HAVE DONE A SIMILAR THING.
BUT I THINK

[Captioner] 19:32:29
 ABSENT THAT I'D PROBABLY BE IN FAVOR OF EXCLUDE

[Captioner] 19:32:32
 EXCLUDING AS WELL.
>> Commissioner Yee:   OKAY.
I JUST WANT TO MAKE

[Captioner] 19:32:35
 SURE WE HAVE OUR BEST FOOT FORWARD.

[Captioner] 19:32:38

BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, LOOKING AT THE ONE IN ALAMEDA AND A COUPLE

[Captioner] 19:32:41
 OF THE OTHER ONES DOWN

[Captioner] 19:32:44
 IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA, WHERE THEY TOO PAST

[Captioner] 19:32:47
 PASSED, THERE ARE A LOT OF SIMILARITIES.

[Captioner] 19:32:51

I WANT THE COMMISSION TO KNOW.
I'M SURE THE

[Captioner] 19:32:54
 STAFF KIND OF TRIED TO MIRROR WHAT WORKED, WE DON'T HAVE

[Captioner] 19:32:57
 TO REINVENT THE WHEEL.
THERE ARE DEFINITELY

[Captioner] 19:33:02
 SOME

[Captioner] 19:33:06
 SIMILARITIES.
BUT OTHER THAN THAT I

[Captioner] 19:33:09
 SEE THE QUESTIONS TO ALL THE QUESTIONS THAT HCD

[Captioner] 19:33:12
 IS ASKING OF US FOR OUR HOUSING ELEMENT REPORT.


[Captioner] 19:33:15
AND IT MIRRORS EXACTLY WHAT I SEE,

[Captioner] 19:33:18
 HOW ALAMEDA DID, IN ORDER TO GET THEIRS THROUGH.

[Captioner] 19:33:21

AND IT'S SECTIONED JUST -- AND I

[Captioner] 19:33:24
 COULD SEE THAT YOU GUYS DID A VERY GOOD JOB MIRRORING IT

[Captioner] 19:33:28
 AS WELL.
SO THE -- I

[Captioner] 19:33:31
 GUESS THE ONLY OTHER THING IS I'M STILL TRYING

[Captioner] 19:33:34
 TO FIGURE OUT WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT ONE PAGE.
IT WENT DOWN

[Captioner] 19:33:37
 FROM 541 DOWN TO  540.
>> WE

[Captioner] 19:33:41
 DID ADJUST FORMATTING A LITTLE BIT AND I THINK

[Captioner] 19:33:44
 THAT CHANGED THE PAGINATION.
WE TRIED OUR BEST

[Captioner] 19:33:47
 TO NOTE ALL AREAS IN CHANGE WE WENT THROUGH

[Captioner] 19:33:50
 RED UNDERLINE OR PURPLE  UNDERLINE THROUGHOUT THE

[Captioner] 19:33:53
 DOCUMENT.
>> Commissioner Yee:   OKAY, GREAT.
AND

[Captioner] 19:33:56
 THEN I GUESS THE OTHER THING TOO, I JUST WONDERED

[Captioner] 19:33:59
, ONCE THIS IS FINALIZED AND HOPEFULLY HC

[Captioner] 19:34:02
D APPROVES IT, IT WILL BE IN MULTIPLE LANGUAGES

[Captioner] 19:34:06
 FOR PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO READ.


[Captioner] 19:34:13
>> I DON'T THINK WE'VE -- I DON'T THINK THAT WAS PART OF THE PLAN TO TRANSLATE THE DOCUMENT

[Captioner] 19:34:17
.
THAT'S GOOD FEEDBACK.
WE'LL ANALYZE

[Captioner] 19:34:20
 THE POTENTIAL TO DO THAT.
>> Commissioner Yee:   OKAY.
ALL RIGHT,

[Captioner] 19:34:23
 JUST THOUGHT.
AND THEN I ALSO WANT TO THANK YOU FOR

[Captioner] 19:34:26
 TAKING CARE OF THAT TABLE 4.3 ERROR.
BECAUSE I

[Captioner] 19:34:29
 NEVER KNEW THAT FREMONT IN 19

[Captioner] 19:34:32
90 ONLY HAD 17,399 PEOPLE BUT

[Captioner] 19:34:35
 I SEE THAT THE DIGIT WAS NOW -- WE'RE AT 1

[Captioner] 19:34:38
73,399 SO THANK YOU FOR CORRECTING THAT.
SO THOSE

[Captioner] 19:34:41
 ARE MY QUESTIONS.
RIGHT?
I KNOW EVERYBODY'S LAUGHING.


[Captioner] 19:34:48
>> Commissioner Daulton:   THANK YOU, COMMISSIONER YEE FOR PROOF

[Captioner] 19:34:51
 PROOFREADING THE DOCUMENT LIKE THAT.
THAT ONE PAGE I SIMPLY

[Captioner] 19:34:54
 ASSUMED THEY WERE TRYING TO CONDENSE.
YOU KNOW,

[Captioner] 19:34:57
 THIS VERY LONG DOCUMENT.
ARE THERE ANY OTHER

[Captioner] 19:35:01
 QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMISSION

[Captioner] 19:35:05
?
COMMISSIONER ZHANG, PLEASE

[Captioner] 19:35:09
.
>> Commissioner Zhang:   THANK YOU, CHAIR.


[Captioner] 19:35:12
I JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY THE

[Captioner] 19:35:16
 TIME LINE, IS IT JANUARY 31st THE

[Captioner] 19:35:20
 APPROVAL BY THE CITY?
>> WE ARE REQUIRED TO

[Captioner] 19:35:24
 ADOPT HOUSING ELEMENT BY THAT DATE.
ALTHOUGH

[Captioner] 19:35:28
 WE HAVE TENTATIVELY

[Captioner] 19:35:32
 SCHEDULED THE CITY COUNCIL MEETING FOR JANUARY 10th

[Captioner] 19:35:36
, IN ADVANCE, HOPING THAT THE PLANNING COMMISSION WILL MOVE THIS

[Captioner] 19:35:39
 FORWARD AND THAT WILL GIVE US A LITTLE BIT OF A
BUFFER

[Captioner] 19:35:42
 BEFORE THE TIME IS UP.

[Captioner] 19:35:45

>> Commissioner Zhang:   ALL RIGHT THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:35:48
I ALSO WANTED TO COMMENT THAT COMMISSIONER YEE MENTION

[Captioner] 19:35:52
ED TRANSLATION TO ANOTHER LANGUAGE.
THAT FRANKLY SPEAKING THAT'S

[Captioner] 19:35:56
 A TREMENDOUS EFFORT TO TRANSLATE SUCH A

[Captioner] 19:35:59
 LONG DOCUMENT TO A DIFFERENT LANGUAGE

[Captioner] 19:36:02
.
I BELIEVE THERE ARE A COUPLE OF THOSE

[Captioner] 19:36:05
 SLIDES IN CHINESE THAT I

[Captioner] 19:36:08
 LIKE THE MAJOR ELEMENT I WOULD SAY

[Captioner] 19:36:12
 THAT PROBABLY IS ENOUGH

[Captioner] 19:36:15
.

[Captioner] 19:36:19

I WOULDN'T -- COMPLYING

[Captioner] 19:36:22
 WITH JUST KEEPING IT IN ENGLISH.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:36:26
>> Planner Pullen:   I DO WANT TO SAY ON THE SUBJECT OF TRANSLATION THAT

[Captioner] 19:36:29
 OUR WEBSITE AFFORDS SOME ABILITY TO VIEW IN

[Captioner] 19:36:32
 MULTIPLE LANGUAGES.
AND SO SOME OF THAT KEY INFORMATION IS ALREADY AVAILABLE

[Captioner] 19:36:35
 TO PEOPLE WHO WANT TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THE PROCESS IN

[Captioner] 19:36:38
 GENERAL.
GOOD POINTS ALL.


[Captioner] 19:36:43
>> Commissioner Daulton:   ALL RIGHT.
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM COMMISSIONER

[Captioner] 19:36:46
S?
NO?
I GUESS I HAVE A COUPLE OF

[Captioner] 19:36:49
 QUESTIONS.
WAYLAND, THERE

[Captioner] 19:36:53
 WAS SOME BACK AND

[Captioner] 19:36:56
 FORTH REGARDING THE NONVACANT SITES ISSUE.
COULD YOU JUST

[Captioner] 19:36:59
 MAYBE ENCAPSULATE THAT AND CLARIFY IT FOR ME

[Captioner] 19:37:04
.
>> ARE YOU REFERRING TO ONE OF THE LETTERS THAT

[Captioner] 19:37:07
 WAS RECEIVED BEFORE THE MEETING?
>> Commissioner Daulton:   AS WELL AS

[Captioner] 19:37:10
 THE COMMENTS FROM THE STATE.


[Captioner] 19:37:14
>> SO I THINK THE

[Captioner] 19:37:18
 -- THE LETTER POINTED

[Captioner] 19:37:21
 TO THE CITY'S USE OF NON

[Captioner] 19:37:24
 NONVACANT SITES IN THE  INVENTORY, PARTICULARLY

[Captioner] 19:37:28
 SITES WITHIN COMMERCIAL CENTERS

[Captioner] 19:37:32
.
SHOPPING CENTERS AND OTHER

[Captioner] 19:37:35
 COMMERCIAL USERS.
AND ONE OF THE REQUIREMENTS OF UTILIZING A

[Captioner] 19:37:38
 NONVACANT SITE IS TO DEMONSTRATE

[Captioner] 19:37:42
 -- IS PROVIDE EVIDENCE THAT

[Captioner] 19:37:45
 THE -- THIS SITE HAS A STRONG LIKELIHOOD

[Captioner] 19:37:49
 OF TURNING OVER DURING THE UPCOMING PLANNING PERIOD AND

[Captioner] 19:37:52

BEING REDEVELOPED.
I

[Captioner] 19:37:56
 THINK SEVERAL THOSE SITES ARE, THEY ARE

[Captioner] 19:37:59
 SOME OF THE STRONGEST SITES OF THE CITY

[Captioner] 19:38:02
 AND DIFFERENT FACTORS INCLUDING TRENDS OF REDEVELOPMENT

[Captioner] 19:38:05
, A PROVEN TRACK RECORD OF THE

[Captioner] 19:38:09
 CITY REDEVELOPING THOSE

[Captioner] 19:38:12
 SITES
AND ASPECTS OF THOSE

[Captioner] 19:38:15
 SITES PROVIDE EVIDENCE OF THE LIKELIHOOD OF DEVELOPMENT

[Captioner] 19:38:18
.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   SO THE VARIETY OF WAYS THAT YOU MAKE THOSE

[Captioner] 19:38:22
 ASSESSMENTS ON THE LIKELIHOOD OF THOSE SITES

[Captioner] 19:38:27
 BEING AVAILABLE

[Captioner] 19:38:30
 FOR RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT, DOES THAT BOIL DOWN TO STATISTICAL

[Captioner] 19:38:34
 OUTPUT
 THAT YOU CAN QUANTIFY AS A POTENTIAL REAL

[Captioner] 19:38:37
 NUMBER OF UNITS?

[Captioner] 19:38:41

>> THOSE CHARACTERISTICS ARE KEY TO SITES THAT WERE

[Captioner] 19:38:44
 REDEVELOPED DURING THE PREVIOUS PLANNING

[Captioner] 19:38:47
 PERIOD, WHAT SITES WERE DEVELOPED,

[Captioner] 19:38:50
 WHAT CHARACTERISTICS THOSE SITES HAVE AND HOW THEY COMPARE TO SITES

[Captioner] 19:38:53
 ON
OUR SITES INVENTORY,

[Captioner] 19:38:56
 LOOKING INTO SOME OF THE THINGS

[Captioner] 19:38:59
 THAT LED TO REDEVELOPMENT OF THOSE SITES AND

[Captioner] 19:39:04
 HOW DO THEY AND DO THE SITES THAT

[Captioner] 19:39:08
 WE'RE PROPOSING MATCH THOSE CHARACTERISTICS.


[Captioner] 19:39:12
>> Commissioner Daulton:   OKAY.
ANOTHER QUESTION WAS

[Captioner] 19:39:16
 ON PROGRAM 36.
THE MIXED USE

[Captioner] 19:39:20
 ELEMENT.
YOU

[Captioner] 19:39:23
 SPEAK IN THAT ELEMENT ABOUT

[Captioner] 19:39:27
 THE

[Captioner] 19:39:30
 DEVELOPER'S SORT OF COMPLAINTS OR COMMENTS ABOUT DIFFICULTY

[Captioner] 19:39:34
 OF RETAIL AND SUBSIDIES REQUIRED FOR THAT KIND

[Captioner] 19:39:37
 OF DEVELOPMENT.
AND THEN GO ON

[Captioner] 19:39:40
 TO STATE THAT YOU'RE GOING TO PROMOTE THRIVING

[Captioner] 19:39:43
 RETAIL CARE DORS.

[Captioner] 19:39:47
 CORRIDORS BUT THERE'S NO MENTION HOW

[Captioner] 19:39:50
 THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.
CAN YOU EXPAND ON THAT A LITTLE BIT?

[Captioner] 19:39:53

>> SURE.
I HAVE AN UPDATE

[Captioner] 19:39:57
 OF THE MIXED USE ORDINANCE IN GENERAL IS

[Captioner] 19:40:00
 A MECHANISM WHERE WE'RE GOING TO LOOK

[Captioner] 19:40:04
 INTO WHAT DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS AND WHAT

[Captioner] 19:40:08
 RULES CAN WE PUT IN PLACE TO MEET THE

[Captioner] 19:40:11
 CITY'S GOALS OF
PROCESSING HOUSING

[Captioner] 19:40:14
.
BUT AT THE SAME TIME MEETING OUR OTHER GOALS

[Captioner] 19:40:17
 WITH REGARDS TO REVITALIZATION OF OUR TOWN CENTERS

[Captioner] 19:40:20
 AND HAVING SERVICES AVAILABLE TO OUR COMMUNITY.
SO THAT'S

[Captioner] 19:40:23
 THE EFFORT.
AND I POINT TO, YOU KNOW, THERE ARE

[Captioner] 19:40:26
 NUMEROUS PROGRAMS WITHIN THE HOUSING

[Captioner] 19:40:30
 ELEMENT WHICH SUPPORT THAT, WHICH

[Captioner] 19:40:34
 SUPPORT REDEVELOPMENT IN VARIOUS WAYS

[Captioner] 19:40:37
, INCLUDING PROVIDING MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR BY

[Captioner] 19:40:40
-RIGHT
DEVELOPMENTS

[Captioner] 19:40:43
, CHANGES IN  PARKING, CHANGES IN PARKING

[Captioner] 19:40:46
 STANDARDS,

[Captioner] 19:40:49
 UPGRADING OR INCREASE

[Captioner] 19:40:53
 INCREASING FOUR YEAR RATIO LIMITS AND OTHERS

[Captioner] 19:40:56
.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   I ASK BECAUSE I KNOW THAT

[Captioner] 19:40:59
 A VERY COMMON COMMENT THAT

[Captioner] 19:41:02
 I RECEIVE

[Captioner] 19:41:05
 ON ACTIONS BY

[Captioner] 19:41:09
 DEVELOPMENT IN FREMONT IS THAT WE LOSE

[Captioner] 19:41:13
 RETAIL.
I MEAN, YOU KNOW, I

[Captioner] 19:41:16
 KNOW YOU REMEMBER THIS SORT OF OUT

[Captioner] 19:41:19
POURING OF GRIEF WHEN CONNOLLY

[Captioner] 19:41:23
'S DISAPPEARED, AND IT APPEARS THAT THERE'S GOING TO

[Captioner] 19:41:26
 BE FURTHER EMPHASIS ON RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT

[Captioner] 19:41:30
 OF FORMER RETAIL
SITES

[Captioner] 19:41:33
.
WHICH IS SORT OF WHY I BROUGHT UP THE NONVACANT SITE ISSUE

[Captioner] 19:41:36
.
SO I KNOW THAT

[Captioner] 19:41:39
 WE'RE GOING TO HEAR ABOUT THAT DOWN THE

[Captioner] 19:41:44
 LINE  AS, YOU KNOW, RETAIL IS TURNED

[Captioner] 19:41:47
 INTO RESIDENTIAL.
I MEAN IT HAPPENS EVERY

[Captioner] 19:41:50
 TIME.


[Captioner] 19:41:55
SO THEN REGARDING PROGRAM 56,

[Captioner] 19:41:59
 HELPING AFFORDABLE DEVELOPERS FIND LAND

[Captioner] 19:42:03
, COULD YOU JUST GIVE ME A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF

[Captioner] 19:42:05
 HOW THAT'S GOING TO WORK?
LIKE

[Captioner] 19:42:09
 ARE AFFORDABLE DEVELOPERS GOING TO BE GIVEN PRIORITY

[Captioner] 19:42:12
 ON CITY-OWNED PROPERTIES OR IS THERE SOME

[Captioner] 19:42:15
 OTHER PRIORITIZATION OF AFFORDABLE

[Captioner] 19:42:20
 DEVELOPERS REGARDS TO FIRST DIBS ON GETTING THEIR

[Captioner] 19:42:23
 HANDS ON NEW
PROPERTIES OR AVAILABLE VACANT SITES?


[Captioner] 19:42:35
>> GIVE ME A MOMENT TO REORIENT

[Captioner] 19:42:39
 WHAT PROGRAM THAT IS.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   I THINK

[Captioner] 19:42:42
 IT'S 56 REGARDING AFFORDABLE

[Captioner] 19:42:45
 DEVELOPERS FIND LAND.


[Captioner] 19:42:58
>> SORRY, I'M THERE.
COULD YOU REPHRASE THE QUESTION?

[Captioner] 19:43:02

>> Commissioner Daulton:   YES.
SO

[Captioner] 19:43:05
 WHEN I -- WHAT PROGRAM 56 LOOKS

[Captioner] 19:43:08
 LIKE IT'S AN

[Captioner] 19:43:11
 ATTEMPT TO HELP

[Captioner] 19:43:15
 AFFORDABLE DEVELOPERS ACCESS

[Captioner] 19:43:18
 SITES, ESSENTIALLY, AND I'M

[Captioner] 19:43:22
 JUST WONDERING ABOUT THE MECHANICS OF THAT.
DOES

[Captioner] 19:43:25
 THAT MEAN YOU'RE GOING TO GIVE A CERTAIN AMOUNT

[Captioner] 19:43:29
 OF PRIORITY TO AFFORDABLE

[Captioner] 19:43:32
 DEVELOPERS WITH REGARD TO  RECENTLY

[Captioner] 19:43:35
 VACANT SITES OR CITY SITES, HOW IS

[Captioner] 19:43:38
 THAT?
>> THERE ARE REQUIREMENTS UNDER SURPLUS

[Captioner] 19:43:41
 LANDS ACT TO MAKE INITIAL OFFER TO

[Captioner] 19:43:44
 AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS BEFORE PROCEEDING WITH

[Captioner] 19:43:48
 A -- DISPOSING THE PROPERTY THROUGH

[Captioner] 19:43:51
 OTHER  USERS.
SO THAT'S A PUBLIC PROPERTY SIDE OF IT.


[Captioner] 19:43:54
I THINK THE PROGRAM IN GENERAL SPEAKS TO THE CITY'S COMMITMENT

[Captioner] 19:43:57
 TO WORKING WITH THE

[Captioner] 19:44:02
 AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS TO

[Captioner] 19:44:06
 IDENTIFY SITES AND INCLUDING

[Captioner] 19:44:09
 THOSE ON THE SITES INVENTORY AND ASSIST THEM IN
NAVIGATE

[Captioner] 19:44:12
ING THE PROCESS.
>> Commissioner Daulton:  

[Captioner] 19:44:15
 OKAY.
I GUESS

[Captioner] 19:44:18
 THAT'S ALL FROM ME.
ANY COMMISSIONERS HAVE ANY FURTHER COMMENTS

[Captioner] 19:44:22
?
COMMISSIONER YEE.
>> Commissioner Yee:   YES,

[Captioner] 19:44:26
 ANOTHER MAYBE COUPLE MORE QUESTIONS.
PROGRAM 33

[Captioner] 19:44:29
, PAGE 29, IT SAYS THAT WE HAVE AN ORDINANCE

[Captioner] 19:44:32
 THAT ALLOWS UP TO

[Captioner] 19:44:36
 2 ADUS AND ONE J ADUS

[Captioner] 19:44:40
 ON ONE SINGLE LOT.

[Captioner] 19:44:44

I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WAS CORRECT

[Captioner] 19:44:47
.
I

[Captioner] 19:44:51
 THOUGHT THAT WAS ONE ADU

[Captioner] 19:44:54
 AND ONEJ ADU.
>> A

[Captioner] 19:44:57
 SINGLE LOT IS ABLE TO

[Captioner] 19:45:01
 HAVE TWO ADUS AND ONE JUNIOR ADU.


[Captioner] 19:45:06
SINGLE FAMILY NEIGHBORHOODS NEAR TRANSIT BY ALLOWING FOR

[Captioner] 19:45:09
 ADDITIONAL ADU DEVELOPMENT ON TOP.
>> Commissioner Yee:   OKAY,

[Captioner] 19:45:12
 OKAY, ALL RIGHT.
THEN I GUESS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT LETTERS, I

[Captioner] 19:45:15
 NOTICE THAT VICE CHAIR RAO, YOU RECEIVED

[Captioner] 19:45:18
 A LETTER FROM AN ORGANIZATION AND I'M JUST WANTING TO

[Captioner] 19:45:22
 KNOW, IF YOU HAD ANY COMMENTS WITH THAT, OR IF THE

[Captioner] 19:45:25
 STAFF HAD
ANY COMMENTS ABOUT THAT LETTER

[Captioner] 19:45:28
?
>> I THINK I ADDRESSED

[Captioner] 19:45:32
 THAT PARTICULAR LETTER A LITTLE BIT THROUGH

[Captioner] 19:45:35
 CHAIRPERSON DAULTON'S COMMENTS.
THAT

[Captioner] 19:45:38
 DID COME THROUGH THE -- THAT DID COME THROUGH

[Captioner] 19:45:41
 MAIL AS

[Captioner] 19:45:48
 ENVELOPES DELIVERED TO THE DIFFERENT PLANNING  COMMISSIONERS.
SO

[Captioner] 19:45:51
 WE HAPPENED TO SCAN COMMISSIONER RAO'S

[Captioner] 19:45:55
 BUT THEY'RE ADDRESSED TO EACH INDIVIDUAL COMMISSIONER AND WE PACKAGED UP

[Captioner] 19:45:58
 AND PUT AS PART OF THIS PACKAGE FOR

[Captioner] 19:46:01
 THE COMMISSION TO REVIEW.
SO IT'S NOT -- IT

[Captioner] 19:46:04
 WASN'T SIMPLY DIRECTED TOWARDS THE VICE CHAIRPERSON

[Captioner] 19:46:08
 BUT IT WAS  DIRECTED --
>> Commissioner Yee:   THAT'S KIND OF WHAT IT

[Captioner] 19:46:11
 LOOKED LIKE BECAUSE I DON'T REMEMBER RECEIVING ANYTHING.
SO I KIND

[Captioner] 19:46:14
 OF WENT OH, WHY -- I WAS JUST

[Captioner] 19:46:17
 THINKING VICE CHAIR RAO GOT THIS ONE SPECIFIC LETTER AND USUALLY IT IS

[Captioner] 19:46:20
 THE WHOLE COMMISSION.
>> APOLOGIES FOR NOT MAKING

[Captioner] 19:46:24
 THAT CLEAR.
IT WAS A QUICK TURN AROUND

[Captioner] 19:46:27
.
>> Commissioner Yee:   OKAY, ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 19:46:30

>> Commissioner Daulton:   COMMISSIONER LIU, PLEASE.


[Captioner] 19:46:33
>> Commissioner Liu:   OKAY, I JUST HAVE A GENERAL COMMENT TO MAKE

[Captioner] 19:46:36
.
THIS HOUSING ELEMENT PLAN FROM 20

[Captioner] 19:46:39
23 TO 2031, IT'S AN EIGHT-YEAR

[Captioner] 19:46:43
 PROGRAM.
AND THIS HAPPENS TO OVERLAP

[Captioner] 19:46:46
 SO COINCIDES WITH THE

[Captioner] 19:46:50
 CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT PLAN TO

[Captioner] 19:46:55
 PHASE OUT THE GAS CARS.
THAT

[Captioner] 19:46:59
 MEANS THE ELECTRIC CARS WILL BECOME

[Captioner] 19:47:02
 MORE AND MORE PERVASIVE

[Captioner] 19:47:05
, AND ESPECIALLY THE

[Captioner] 19:47:08
 CHEAPER ELECTRIC CARS FROM

[Captioner] 19:47:12
 OTHER TRADITIONAL CAR COMPANIES

[Captioner] 19:47:16
.
WITH THAT ADOPTION OF ELECTRIC CARS IS GOING TO CREATE

[Captioner] 19:47:19
 AN ENORMOUS STRAIN ON OUR INFRASTRUCTURE,

[Captioner] 19:47:23
 OUR ELECTRICAL GRID.
AND WITH THE

[Captioner] 19:47:26
 ANTICIPATED MUCH HIGHER DENSITY CALLED

[Captioner] 19:47:29
 FOR IN THIS HOUSING ELEMENT

[Captioner] 19:47:34
, ARE WE -- DO WE HAVE A PLAN TO

[Captioner] 19:47:37
 WORK WITH THE PG&E

[Captioner] 19:47:41
 AND THE OTHER POTENTIAL POWER

[Captioner] 19:47:45
 SUPPLIERS IN THIS MORE AND

[Captioner] 19:47:48
 MORE POPULAR
AND

[Captioner] 19:47:53
 BATTERY STORAGE OF POWER

[Captioner] 19:47:57
, ALL THESE POWER SUPPLIERS WILL MOST

[Captioner] 19:48:02
 LIKELY CREATE ISSUES

[Captioner] 19:48:05
 ON LAND USE AS WELL, BECAUSE I CAN

[Captioner] 19:48:10
 FORESEE PG&E NOT BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE ENOUGH POWER FOR A

[Captioner] 19:48:13
 LOT OF BUILDING
SITES THAT REQUIRE A LOT MORE

[Captioner] 19:48:17
 ELECTRIC CHARGING STATIONS.

[Captioner] 19:48:20

THEY MAY REQUIRE CONTAINER SIZ

[Captioner] 19:48:23
ED BATTERY PACKS, AND ALL

[Captioner] 19:48:26
 OF THAT

[Captioner] 19:48:32
 WILL BECOME ISSUES THAT I THINK WE NEED TO LOOK AT.
SO I JUST

[Captioner] 19:48:36
 WANT TO MAKE SURE THE HOUSING ELEMENT WILL

[Captioner] 19:48:40
 CAPTURE THE INFRASTRUCTURE

[Captioner] 19:48:45
 DEMANDS BY THIS NEW

[Captioner] 19:48:48
 ADOPTION OF ELECTRIC CARS.


[Captioner] 19:48:52
SO THAT'S MY COMMENT.


[Captioner] 19:49:01
>> Planner Pullen:   SO I CAN SPEAK TO THAT VERY BRIEFLY, COMMISSIONER LIU

[Captioner] 19:49:04
, AND THAT IS, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU SAW BUT THE STATE

[Captioner] 19:49:07
'S BEEN WORKING ON THIS LAST WEEK

[Captioner] 19:49:11
, CARB RELEASED, IT'S

[Captioner] 19:49:15
 A SCOPING
PLAN THAT LOOKS

[Captioner] 19:49:18
 TOWARDS I THINK IT'S 2045 CARBON

[Captioner] 19:49:21
 NEUTRALITY, THAT IS A REALLY BIG SUBJECT, THAT

[Captioner] 19:49:24
 INVOLVES MULTIPLE SECTORS OF THE ECONOMY.
HOUSING IS ONE OF THOSE

[Captioner] 19:49:27
 BUT, YOU KNOW, BUSINESS AND A LOT OF OTHER COMPONENTS GO INTO THAT

[Captioner] 19:49:31
.
WE HAVE OUR OWN CLIMATE ACTION PLAN THAT WILL

[Captioner] 19:49:34
 BE COMING TO THE CITY COUNCIL FOR

[Captioner] 19:49:38
 APPROVAL IN THE NEAR FUTURE THAT

[Captioner] 19:49:41
 ALSO QUANTITY NICE WHAT THAT MEANS

[Captioner] 19:49:48
 QUANTIFY

[Captioner] 19:49:51
IES FOR FREMONT.
AS YOU KNOW THE STATE HAS

[Captioner] 19:49:55
 BEEN SLOWLY ERODING THE ABILITY FOR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO

[Captioner] 19:49:58
 REQUIRE PARKING AND MANY LOCAL JURISDICTIONS HAVE ELIMINATED

[Captioner] 19:50:01
 PARKING IN CERTAIN  CIRCUMSTANCES,

[Captioner] 19:50:04
 OR
WHOLLY WITHIN THEIR CITIES.

[Captioner] 19:50:07

SAN JOSE HIT THE NEWS RECENTLY FOR

[Captioner] 19:50:12
 THAT -- A CONTINUATION OF THAT TREND.
AND

[Captioner] 19:50:16
 SO, YOU KNOW, VEHICLE USE ITSELF MAY TAPER

[Captioner] 19:50:19
 OFF, THE IDEA THAT I'VE HEARD IS

[Captioner] 19:50:22
 THAT IT'S NOT

[Captioner] 19:50:26
 ENOUGH FOR LONG TERM CLIMATE GOALS TO

[Captioner] 19:50:29
 ELIMINATE GAS CARS.
BUT ALSO, TO

[Captioner] 19:50:32
 REDUCE DRIVING IN GENERAL VEHICLE MILES

[Captioner] 19:50:36
 TRAVELED EVEN WITH ELECTRIC.
BECAUSE THERE ARE STILL

[Captioner] 19:50:39
 IMPACTS AND THAT GOES TO THE CLEANLINESS OF THE GRID

[Captioner] 19:50:42
, ET CETERA.
SO THAT'S A PRETTY BIG SUBJECT.
ALL CITIES

[Captioner] 19:50:45
 IN CALIFORNIA AND THE WORLD, ARE GOING TO HAVE TO DEAL

[Captioner] 19:50:48
 WITH THIS SUBJECT.
AND IT'S A LITTLE BEYOND THE SCOPE

[Captioner] 19:50:51
 OF THIS EXERCISE TONIGHT BUT I

[Captioner] 19:50:54
 THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT ONE TO THINK ABOUT

[Captioner] 19:50:58
.
>> Commissioner Liu:   THANK  YOU, JOEL.

[Captioner] 19:51:01

>> Commissioner Daulton:   COMMISSIONER ZHANG DID YOU HAVE A 

[Captioner] 19:51:06
QUESTION?
>> Commissioner Zhang:   THANK YOU CHAIR.

[Captioner] 19:51:09

QUESTION ABOUT QUESTION 9, SHORT

[Captioner] 19:51:13
 TERM RENTAL, IN THE TIME FRAME INDICATING WE NEED

[Captioner] 19:51:16
 TO ADOPT A RENTAL, SHORT TERM

[Captioner] 19:51:20
 RENTAL ORDINANCE WITHIN 12 MONTHS OF THIS ADOPTION.


[Captioner] 19:51:23
I BELIEVE THERE IS ALREADY A

[Captioner] 19:51:26
 SHORT TERM RENTAL

[Captioner] 19:51:29
 ORDINANCE

[Captioner] 19:51:32
 CIRCLING AROUND.
WILL THAT COME TO THE PLANNING COMMISSION FIRST

[Captioner] 19:51:35
 OR GO TO THE CITY COUNCIL DIRECTLY

[Captioner] 19:51:39
?
>> Planner Pullen:   TO THE EXTENT THAT

[Captioner] 19:51:42
 THE SHORT TERM RENTAL ORDINANCE THAT WE

[Captioner] 19:51:45
 ARE ALONG THE WAY WE HAVE BEEN PREPARING, AND

[Captioner] 19:51:48
 YOU MAY HAVE SEEN THAT BECAUSE WE HAD A PUBLIC MEETING

[Captioner] 19:51:51
, NOT TOO LONG AGO.
IF

[Captioner] 19:51:55
 THAT -- TO THE EXTENT THAT THAT MODIFIES PORTION

[Captioner] 19:51:58
S OF THE PLANNING AND ZONING CODE THAT WOULD BE SUBJECT TO

[Captioner] 19:52:01
 YOUR REVIEW.
AND SO LOOK FOR THAT TO BE NOTICED, IF THAT'S

[Captioner] 19:52:04
 THE CASE.
THE SHORT TERM

[Captioner] 19:52:08
 RENTAL ORDINANCES CAN EASILY

[Captioner] 19:52:11
 BE COMPLETED WITHIN 12 MONTHS OF THE ADOPTION OF THIS.
THAT'S

[Captioner] 19:52:14
 SORT OF A WINDOW THAT'S GENERALLY, YOU KNOW, KIND

[Captioner] 19:52:17
 OF A GOOD NUMBER, EVEN THOUGH

[Captioner] 19:52:20
 SOME THINGS MIGHT HAPPEN SOONER THAN THAT.


[Captioner] 19:52:27
>> Commissioner Zhang:   THANK YOU.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   ANY FURTHER CLARIFICATION

[Captioner] 19:52:30
 QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMISSION?
SEEING NONE TRISH I WOULD ASK IF

[Captioner] 19:52:33
 THERE ARE ANY PUBLIC COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS?
>> Trish Cordova:  

[Captioner] 19:52:36
 CHAIR DAULTON I DO HAVE TWO SPEAKERS.
HOW MANY MINUTES DO

[Captioner] 19:52:38
 THEY HAVE?
>> Commissioner Daulton:   THREE MINUTES.


[Captioner] 19:52:41
THREE MINUTES.
>> Trish Cordova:   OKAY, ALL RIGHT, I'LL GO AHEAD AND

[Captioner] 19:52:44
 INTRODUCE OUR FIRST SPEAKER.

[Captioner] 19:52:48

KELLY A, PLEASE GO AHEAD AND SPEAK, YOU HAVE BEEN

[Captioner] 19:52:51
 GIVEN PERMISSION.
>> THANK YOU.
SO ON PAGE 5-

[Captioner] 19:52:54
35 IT SAYS SOMETHING ABOUT EVALUATE BUILDING FEES AS

[Captioner] 19:52:57
 A CONSTRAINT.

[Captioner] 19:53:01

AND, YOU KNOW, ON ONE OF THE JUSTIFICATION

[Captioner] 19:53:05
S OFFERED OR  EXCUSES OR

[Captioner] 19:53:09
 RATIONALIZATIONS, QUOTE DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEES ARE A

[Captioner] 19:53:12
 REFLECTION OF COMMUNITY VALUES.
WELL RECEIPT LIED

[Captioner] 19:53:15
ING  SEGREGATION, THAT REFLECTION

[Captioner] 19:53:18
 FLECTS COMMUNITY

[Captioner] 19:53:22
 VALUES AS WELL, THAT

[Captioner] 19:53:25
 FLECTS COMMUNITY VALUES, RESISTANCE TO

[Captioner] 19:53:29
 COMMUNITY CONSTRUCTION, THAT REFLECTS

[Captioner] 19:53:32
 COMMUNITY VALUES.
THAT DOESN'T PUT FEES

[Captioner] 19:53:36
 IN CONTEXT TO OTHER CITIES.
THE FREMONT, THERE IS DATA OUT

[Captioner] 19:53:39
 THERE THOUGH, THAT FREMONT WAS CALLED OUT IN TWO STUDIES BY

[Captioner] 19:53:42
 U.C. BERKELEY TURNER CENTER FOR HOUSING

[Captioner] 19:53:45
 INNOVATION AS HAVING SOME OF THE HIGHEST BUILDING FEES IN THE

[Captioner] 19:53:48
 STATE,
ESPECIALLY FOR SINGLE FAMILY HOMES, I'M

[Captioner] 19:53:51
 QUOTING FROM THE NEWSPAPER, I'M SURE YOU READ THE SAME PAPER.
THEY

[Captioner] 19:53:54
 REPORTED THAT WHEN THE FULL COMPLEMENT OF FEES ARE INCLUDED

[Captioner] 19:53:57
 A SINGLE FAMILY HOME IN FREMONT COULD WIND UP

[Captioner] 19:54:00
 PAYING ROUGHLY  $150,000, I THINK IT'S UP TO $

[Captioner] 19:54:04
 $160,000 NOW IN THIS REPORT.
THE CITY HAS

[Captioner] 19:54:07
 NOW BEGUN TO ADJUST FEES ANNUALLY TO THE

[Captioner] 19:54:11
 BUILDING COST INDEX,

[Captioner] 19:54:14
 AS ISSUED BY THE McGRAW WEEKLY

[Captioner] 19:54:18
.
IT ROSE 14% IN THE MOST

[Captioner] 19:54:21
 RECENT YEAR.
SO THAT IS A VERY IMPORTANT

[Captioner] 19:54:25
 VERIFIED INDEX TO BE SELECTED RIGHT?
THIS CITY APPEARS TO BE

[Captioner] 19:54:28
 AN INFLATING SENSE OF MUNICIPAL ENTITLEMENT

[Captioner] 19:54:31
.
YOU KNOW, AND IF WE ARE GOING TO BE GOING DOWN THIS ROAD

[Captioner] 19:54:34
 OF SPECIALIZED DEMS FOR FEES, BUILDING

[Captioner] 19:54:38
 FEES, WHY NOT TAKE THE HIGHER EDUCATION

[Captioner] 19:54:41
 PRICE INDEX, USE THIS FOR PRIEFG

[Captioner] 19:54:44
 EDUCATION, TUTORING CENTERS,
AS

[Captioner] 19:54:47
 A MEASURE OF THE HIGHER EDUCATION

[Captioner] 19:54:51
, HOW ABOUT THE INDEX OF

[Captioner] 19:54:54
 MEDICAL OFFICES, HOW

[Captioner] 19:54:58
 ABOUT RESTAURANT PRICE INDEX FOR

[Captioner] 19:55:01
 FAST FOOD OPERATIONS, YOU KNOW.
DRILL DOWN INTO

[Captioner] 19:55:04
 EACH INDIVIDUAL MARKET THAT YOU'RE SERVING AND CHARGE THEM

[Captioner] 19:55:07
 THE FEES, THE FEE INDEX THAT THEY DESERVE.


[Captioner] 19:55:10
HOW ABOUT THE FOOD INDEX AND THE CONSUMER PRICE

[Captioner] 19:55:13
 INDEX FOR  SUPERMARKETS?
HOW ABOUT THE ENERGY

[Captioner] 19:55:17
 INDEX AND THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX FOR GAS STATION

[Captioner] 19:55:20
S AND ELECTRICAL INFRASTRUCTURE?
YOU KNOW THIS CITY

[Captioner] 19:55:23
 RANKED UP THERE AT THE TOP OF THE LIST ALONG WITH

[Captioner] 19:55:26
 IRVINE, CALIFORNIA AS HAVING THE HIGHEST FEES

[Captioner] 19:55:30
 FOR DEVELOPMENT.
AND WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT AFFORDABILITY

[Captioner] 19:55:33
 AND STUFF, THIS KIND OF SLIPPERY

[Captioner] 19:55:36
 EVASIVENESS WHERE YOU SAY WELL, YOU KNOW, HERE

[Captioner] 19:55:39
 ARE OUR FEES, YOU KNOW, HERE'S EVER SINGLE

[Captioner] 19:55:42
 ONE, NOBODY CAN TELL THAT YOU'RE CHARGE

[Captioner] 19:55:45
ING
 AMONG THE HIGHEST.
IT JUST LOOKS LIKE A

[Captioner] 19:55:49
 BUNCH OF NUMBERS.
NOBODY CAN TELL THAT YOU ARE INDEXING IT TO

[Captioner] 19:55:52
 AN INDEX THAT ROSE 14% LAST YEAR.
THIS CITY

[Captioner] 19:55:55
 NEEDS TO TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AND ASK ITSELF WHY DON'T

[Captioner] 19:55:58
 WE CHARGE FEES THAT ARE IN LINE WITH THE AVERAGE OF THE OTHER CITIES IN

[Captioner] 19:56:01
 CALIFORNIA?

 LEARNED A LOT FROM YOU IN HOW TO LOOK AT PROJECTS IN A

[Captioner] 20:05:04
 VERY OPEN WAY.
I APPRECIATE THAT.
I DON'T THINK IT

[Captioner] 20:05:07
 IS ADVERSARIAL, IT IS TO OPEN OUR EYES AND

[Captioner] 20:05:10
 THAT'S WHAT A GOOD PLANNING COMMISSION DOES SO MUCH

[Captioner] 20:05:15

[Captioner] 20:05:58
 TO SECOND WHAT EVERYBODY ELSE HAS SAID.
I DON'T WANT

[Captioner] 20:06:02

I FEEL BAD THAT YOU DIDN'T MAKE

[Captioner] 20:06:09
 THE LAST ELECTION THAT YOU WENT

[Captioner] 20:06:12
 TO.
I THINK YOU WOULD HAVE BROUGHT

[Captioner] 20:06:15
 A REALLY DYNAMIC

[Captioner] 20:06:18
 ELEMENT TO THE CITY COUNCIL.
SO

[Captioner] 20:06:21

[Captioner] 20:06:56

JOEL GOING AHEAD.
>> FOR MY PART, YOU KNOW, I

[Captioner] 20:07:03
 DO WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR SR. TO THE

[Captioner] 20:07:07
 PUBLIC.
I WAS GOING TO SAY SOMETHING, I WILL SAY I DON'T REMEMBER

[Captioner] 20:07:11
 A PLANNING COMMISSION WE ARE A BETTER MUSTACHE SO I

[Captioner] 20:07:14
 THINK YOU HAVE THAT

[Captioner] 20:07:18
 TITLE.
THAT WILL BE AN

[Captioner] 20:07:21
 EARMARK.
>> YEAH.
RIGHT THERE.


[Captioner] 20:07:26
>> AS STAFF, WE FACILITATE THE REVIEW, IT IS

[Captioner] 20:07:29
 A LOT OF WORK THAT HAPPENS BEFORE THESE

[Captioner] 20:07:32
 PROJECTS GET TO YOU AND WE'RE MAKING SURE THEY'RE DOTTING THE

[Captioner] 20:07:36
 Is AND CROSSING THE Ts.
OUR WORK IN THE

[Captioner] 20:07:39
 END RELIES AND CITIZEN BOARD OR COMMISSION,

[Captioner] 20:07:42
 SO YOU BRING YOUR OWN UNIQUE

[Captioner] 20:07:45
 LIFE EXPERIENCES, BRING YOUR OWN LOCAL KNOWLEDGE AND

[Captioner] 20:07:48
 THE IDEA IS YOU ADD VALUE BECAUSE OF THAT, AS

[Captioner] 20:07:51
 BOARD.
SO I KNOW YOU HAD THAT LOCAL

[Captioner] 20:07:55
 KNOWLEDGE AND UNIQUE EXPERIENCES IN SPADES AND

[Captioner] 20:07:58
 I APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING THAT TO EVERY MEETING.
>>

[Captioner] 20:08:01
 THANK YOU.
>> THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:08:04
I DO HAVE SOME OTHER ANNOUNCEMENTS AND I WILL

[Captioner] 20:08:07
 LAUNCH INTO THEM HERE BEFORE WE CLOSE.
I DID WANT TO

[Captioner] 20:08:11
 SAY, AS WAS MENTIONED DURING THE AGENDA ITEM THE

[Captioner] 20:08:14
 COUNCIL IS SCHEDULED TO REVIEW THE PLANNING

[Captioner] 20:08:17
 COMMISSION'S RECOMMENDATION ON THE

[Captioner] 20:08:21
 HOUSING ELEMENT -- SOUNDS LIKE SOMEONE HAS AN OPEN

[Captioner] 20:08:25
 MIC.
THANK YOU.
SO, THEY WILL REVIEW IT ON THE

[Captioner] 20:08:28
 10TH, AND THEN IN ADDITION TO THE ACTUAL HOUSING

[Captioner] 20:08:31
 ELEMENT, REMEMBER THAT WE TALKED ABOUT A COUPLE OF THE ACTION

[Captioner] 20:08:35
 ITEMS, MANY OF THESE PROGRAMS

[Captioner] 20:08:39
 HAVE 12 MONTH, MONTH, 36 MONTH TIME FRAMES SO YOU WILL

[Captioner] 20:08:42
 SEE ACTION ITEMS.
HOUSING IS NOT

[Captioner] 20:08:45
 AN OPEN AND SHUT BOOK, IT IS A ROAD MAP TO DO THINGS

[Captioner] 20:08:48
 TO MOVE HOUSING FORWARD FOR MORE PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY.


[Captioner] 20:08:51
SO YOU WILL SEE THOSE ACTIONS CONTINUING

[Captioner] 20:08:55
 LONG AFTER THE COUNCIL MAKES

[Captioner] 20:08:58
 THEIR ADOPTION IN JANUARY.
SO LOOK FOR

[Captioner] 20:09:01
 MORE EVIDENCE OF THIS WORK CONTINUING.
THE SECOND THING

[Captioner] 20:09:04
 I WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT IS THE SIGN YOU REVIEWED

[Captioner] 20:09:07
 IN APRIL, WE DID RECEIVE AN APPEAL TO THE COUNCIL FOR

[Captioner] 20:09:11
 THAT ITEM SO THIS IS GOING TO BE TAKEN TO THE COUNCIL IN THE

[Captioner] 20:09:14
 NEW YEAR, LIKELY LATE JANUARY, EARLY FEBRUARY, FOR

[Captioner] 20:09:17
