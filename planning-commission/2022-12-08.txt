[Captioner] 19:04:41
 TO ATTEND TO SEE SO I DID HEAR THE CONVERSATIONS LAST TIME.
I

[Captioner] 19:04:44
 DROVE BY THE THORNTON SITE AND THEN HI A QUESTION, I DRIVE

[Captioner] 19:04:47
 BY THE

[Captioner] 19:04:51
 SILICON SAGE SITE VERY OFTEN BECAUSE MY BUSINESS IS

[Captioner] 19:04:55
 VERY CLOSE TO IT.
AND I WANTED TO UNDERSTAND, YOU KNOW, IF

[Captioner] 19:04:58
 I NEED TO BE RECUSED OR NOT.
I DO NOT OWN THE PROPERTY

[Captioner] 19:05:02
 THAT IS CLOSE TO THERE.
THAT'S OWNED BY MY

[Captioner] 19:05:05
 PARENTS.
BUT MY BUSINESS IS RIGHT KITTY

[Captioner] 19:05:08
 CORNER IN THAT SITE.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   JOEL COULD YOU

[Captioner] 19:05:12
 SPEAK TO THAT?

 INTEREST WITHIN 500 FEET OF THE SITE OR

[Captioner] 19:05:24
 UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS, A LITTLE FURTHER

[Captioner] 19:05:27
,

[Captioner] 19:05:31
 IT MIGHT BE PRUDENT TO RECUSE YOURSELF FROM THAT ITEM

[Captioner] 19:05:34
.
OUR SENIOR DEPUTY CITY ATTORNEY IS HERE

[Captioner] 19:05:37
 AS WELL.
IF YOU HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT IT OR YOU FEEL YOU COULDN'T

[Captioner] 19:05:41
 JUDGE FAIRLY IN ANY CASE REGARDLESS OF THE

[Captioner] 19:05:44
 SPECIFIC DISTANCE YOU COULD ALSO JUST CHOOSE NOT TO PARTICIPATE OUT

[Captioner] 19:05:47
 OF CAUTION.
HEATHER.
>> YEAH, I WOULD

[Captioner] 19:05:50
 SAY WITHOUT KNOWING ALL THE DETAILS OF YOUR FINANCIAL INTEREST I

[Captioner] 19:05:53
 MEAN THERE IS A POSSIBILITY OF A FINANCIAL INTEREST THAT IS AFFECTED BY

[Captioner] 19:05:57
 THE OUTCOME THEN IT WOULD BE PRUDENT TO RECUSE
YOURSELF

[Captioner] 19:06:00
.
IF WE KNOW MORE, MAYBE AHEAD OF TIME

[Captioner] 19:06:03
 WE COULD LOOK AT IT MORE CLOSELY BUT I THINK THAT IS PROBABLY THE

[Captioner] 19:06:07
 MORE PRUDENT  COURSE.

[Captioner] 19:06:10

>> Commissioner Basrai:   OKAY THEN I'LL CHOOSE TO RECUSE

[Captioner] 19:06:13
 MYSELF.
COULD I

[Captioner] 19:06:16
 LISTEN IN OR RECUSE MYSELF FROM THE VOTE?

 CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT DEALERSHIP AND WOULD BE LIMITED TO ADVERTISING

[Captioner] 19:09:34
 FOR DEALERSHIP ITSELF.
NO CHANGE

[Captioner] 19:09:37
ABLE COPY OR OFFSITE PROPERTY IS PROPOSED

[Captioner] 19:09:41
 AND CONDITIONS OF APPROVAL WOULD PROHIBIT THAT TYPES OF

[Captioner] 19:09:44
 SIGNS.
THE DEALERSHIP WAS APPROVED BY THE

[Captioner] 19:09:47
 ZONING ADMINISTRATOR ON JUNE 30th, 2020.
THE

[Captioner] 19:09:51
 APPLICANT PREEIVELT PROPOSED A LARGER SIGN AT THE SITE

[Captioner] 19:09:54
 WHICH WAS PRESENTED AT THE

[Captioner] 19:09:57
 FEBRUARY 10  2022 PLANNING COMMISSION

[Captioner] 19:10:00
  HEARING.
THE ITEM

[Captioner] 19:10:04
 WAS

[Captioner] 19:10:07
 OUTREACH TO NEIGHBORS AND TO PREPARE A VISUAL ANALYSIS OF THE

[Captioner] 19:10:10
 PROPOSED SIGN.
THE APPLICANT HAS USED THAT TIME TO

[Captioner] 19:10:13
 MODIFY THE PROMOTE

[Captioner] 19:10:17
 PROPOSAL, TO MODIFY THE

[Captioner] 19:10:20
 SIGN TO IN ORDER TO

[Captioner] 19:10:24
 ADDRESS CONCERNS RAISED BY THE COMMISSION DURING THE FEBRUARY

[Captioner] 19:10:27
 HEARING THE APPLICANT HAS 
REVISED THE PROPOSAL TO REDUCE THE HEIGHT

[Captioner] 19:10:30
 OF THE SIGN FROM 45 FEET TO 35

[Captioner] 19:10:33
 FEET A 12.5% REDUCTION

[Captioner] 19:10:36
 IN HEIGHT.
THE SIGN HAS BEEN REDUCED IN AREA FROM 1

[Captioner] 19:10:40
52 SQUARE FEET TO 120 SQUARE FEET.


[Captioner] 19:10:43
A REDUCTION OF 21% IN SIGN AREA.


[Captioner] 19:10:50
THE PAPE MACHINERY SITE IS ZONED SERVICE INDUSTRIAL

[Captioner] 19:10:53
, WITH INDUSTRIAL USES BOUNDING THE SITE ON

[Captioner] 19:10:56
 TWO SIDES.
THE

[Captioner] 19:11:00
 JEHOVAH'S WITNESSES HALL

[Captioner] 19:11:03
 AT THE NORTH IS

[Captioner] 19:11:08
 DIVIDED BY TREES.
THE

[Captioner] 19:11:12
 KILOEST, BEHIND A SOUND WALL WHICH

[Captioner] 19:11:15
 WOULD BLOCK VIEWS OF THE PROPOSED SIGN.


[Captioner] 19:11:18
THE APPLICANT HAS REACHED OUT TO NEIGHBORING PROPERTY

[Captioner] 19:11:21
 OWNERS AND NO CONCERNS ABOUT THE PROPOSED SIGN HAVE

[Captioner] 19:11:24
 BEEN RECEIVED.
ADDITIONALLY, THE SITE IS CROSS

[Captioner] 19:11:27
 CROSSED BY MULTIPLE HIGH VOLTAGE POWER LINES AND

[Captioner] 19:11:31
 THE SEVEN EXISTING LATTICE TOWERS

[Captioner] 19:11:34
 GREATLY IMPACT THE EXISTING VIEW OF THE SITE

[Captioner] 19:11:37
 FROM THE INTERSTATE 680 FREEWAY.
IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE

[Captioner] 19:11:40
 THAT THIS TYPE OF SIGN WOULD ONLY BE ALLOWED ON

[Captioner] 19:11:43
 A FEW PARCELS ALONG THE INTERSTATE

[Captioner] 19:11:47
 680 CORRIDOR IN FREMONT.
FREMONT PYLON

[Captioner] 19:11:50
 SIGNS ARE ONLY ALLOWED ON INDUSTRIAL SIGNS DIRECTLY ABUT

[Captioner] 19:11:53
TING THE FREEWAY.
LESS THAN TEN PARCELS

[Captioner] 19:11:56
 ALONG INTERSTATE 680 WOULD MEET

[Captioner] 19:12:00
 THIS REQUIREMENT.
INDUSTRIAL PARCELS NORTH OF THE

[Captioner] 19:12:03
 SITE ARE BLOCKED FROM THE FREEWAY BY A HILL SO

[Captioner] 19:12:06
 FREEWAY SIGNAGE IS UNLIKELY

[Captioner] 19:12:09
 TO BE FEASIBLE ON THOSE PARCELS.
THE

[Captioner] 19:12:12
 APPLICANT HAS INSTALLED A TOWER AT THE SITE WITH

[Captioner] 19:12:16
 COLORED MESH TO MARK

[Captioner] 19:12:19
 HEIGHTS AT THE TOP OF THE GRADE.
THE TOP OF THE GREEN MESH IS

[Captioner] 19:12:22
 AT THE 30 FOOT LEVEL.
THE PROPOSED

[Captioner] 19:12:25
 SIGN IS 35 FEET TALL.
SO IT WOULD BE IN THE

[Captioner] 19:12:28
 MIDDLE OF THE RED MESH PANEL.


[Captioner] 19:12:34
CITY STAFF VISITED THE SITE AFTER THE TOWER WAS INSTALLED

[Captioner] 19:12:37
, AND TOOK THE PHOTOS SHOWN HERE.


[Captioner] 19:12:40
AS YOU CAN SEE, THE SIGN WOULD BE RELATIVELY LOW

[Captioner] 19:12:43
 IN COMPARISON TO THE FREEWAY, AND THE UTILITY

[Captioner] 19:12:46
 LATTICE TOWERS CLUTTERED THE EXISTING VIEWS OF THE SITE

[Captioner] 19:12:49
.
AS CURRENTLY

[Captioner] 19:12:52
 DESIGNED THE PROPOSED SIGN WOULD BE LOCATED APPROXIMATELY SEVEN FEET

[Captioner] 19:12:56
 ABOVE THE GRADE OF THE FREEWAY.
IF THE SIGN WAS SHORTER,

[Captioner] 19:12:59
 IT COULD BE BLOCKED BY THE FREEWAY BARRIERS.


[Captioner] 19:13:03
DONOVAN LOZARO WILL NOW

[Captioner] 19:13:07
 SPEAK ABOUT THE ECONOMIC  CONSIDERATIONS OF THE PROJECT.


[Captioner] 19:13:10

[Captioner] 19:13:36
 LABOR OF LOVE FOR THE PAST FIVE YEARS, ULTIMATELY TAKING

[Captioner] 19:13:39
 A SITE THAT WAS HIGHLY BLIGHTED

[Captioner] 19:13:42
 AND CONSIDERED UNDEVELOPABLE DUE TO THE UTILITIES

[Captioner] 19:13:46
 TRAVERSING THIS SITE AND TURNING IT TO A
MAJOR

[Captioner] 19:13:49
 TAX REVENUE GENERATE TO SUPPORT CITY SERVICES

[Captioner] 19:13:52
 AND SUPPLYING CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE TO OUR REGION.


[Captioner] 19:13:55
THIS PROJECT IS THE MOST EXPENSIVE IN THE

[Captioner] 19:13:58
 COMPANY'S HISTORY, CONSOLIDATING

[Captioner] 19:14:01
 MULTIPLE LOCATIONS IN FREMONT,

[Captioner] 19:14:05
 INTO A CORPORATION YARD.
THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE

[Captioner] 19:14:08
 RECOGNIZED PAPE'S INVESTMENT, AND THE CRITICAL ROLE OF

[Captioner] 19:14:11
 ITS SERVICES TO THE STATE'S DEVELOPMENT AND PROVIDED TAX DEVELOPMENTS

[Captioner] 19:14:14
 TO HELP OFFSET THE COMPANY

[Captioner] 19:14:19

INVESTMENT.

PAPE IS A LONG STANDING FREMONT BUSINESS

 HAVING OPERATED HERE SINCE 1984

[Captioner] 19:14:28
.
THEIR CUSTOMERS INCLUDE MOST

[Captioner] 19:14:33
 OF THE PUBLIC AGENCIES.
IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT PAPE

[Captioner] 19:14:36
 IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT TAX

[Captioner] 19:14:39
 GENERATORS IN THE CITY.
ANOTHER IT IS ONLY A

[Captioner] 19:14:42
TOP 25 TAX GENERATOR THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS

[Captioner] 19:14:46

ALTHOUGH IT

[Captioner] 19:14:49
 MAY NOT PROVIDE A WAY FINDING

[Captioner] 19:14:53
 SIGN IN THE ERA OF GMS,

[Captioner] 19:14:56
 WE FLO IT WILL SUPPORT GREATER AWARENESS AND SALES AT

[Captioner] 19:14:59
 THAT POINT OF SALE OVER TIME.
IN STAFF'S VIEW THE SIGN IS

[Captioner] 19:15:02
 APPROPRIATELY SIZED AND LOCATED AND WE RECOMMEND

[Captioner] 19:17:28
 152 SQUARE FEET AND WE ENDED THE MEETING WITH AN AGREEMENT

[Captioner] 19:17:32
 TO REVISIT THE
DISCUSS IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THIS

[Captioner] 19:17:35
 COMMISSION'S CONCERNS.
BUT FIRSTLY

[Captioner] 19:17:38
 A LITTLE BIT OF SIGNAGE.
THE OBJECTIVE FOR SIGNAGE FOR

[Captioner] 19:17:41
  US, IT'S OBVIOUSLY DESIGNED TO ATTRACT BUSINESS

[Captioner] 19:17:44
 BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE WANT TO BE RESPECTFUL OF THE ENVIRONMENT WHERE IT'S

[Captioner] 19:17:48
 MEANT TO WORK AND THAT MEANS IN PROPORTION
TO

[Captioner] 19:17:51
 ITS SURROUNDINGS SUBDUE

[Captioner] 19:17:55
ED LIGHTING, OPAQUE BACKGROUND AND LIMIT

[Captioner] 19:17:58
ED SQUARE FOOTAGE.
THE IMPORTANCE FOR US FOR THIS

[Captioner] 19:18:01
 SIGN IS OBVIOUSLY INTERSTATE 6

[Captioner] 19:18:04
80 AND THE TRAFFIC COUNTS IT PRESENTS AS HIGHLIGHTED ON THE

[Captioner] 19:18:08
 SCREEN HERE.
OVER 150,000 VEHICLES PER

[Captioner] 19:18:11
 DAY PASS BY THIS PLACE WHICH GIVES YOU

[Captioner] 19:18:14
 A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO ATTRACT BUSINESS FROM A POPULATION THAT DRIVES

[Captioner] 19:18:17
 BY.


[Captioner] 19:18:21
IMPACT OF SIGNAGE ON OUR BUSINESS

[Captioner] 19:18:24
.
WE'VE DONE EXTENSIVE BRAND RESEARCH ON WHAT THE SIGNAGE

[Captioner] 19:18:28
 MEANS TO US AND THE STUDIES THAT WE USE INDICATE THAT CONSUMERS

[Captioner] 19:18:31
 DO MAKE DETERMINATIONS ABOUT THE QUALITY OF THE BUSINESS BASED ON

[Captioner] 19:18:34
 ITS SIGNS.
FOR EXAMPLE, EACH ADDITIONAL SIGN

[Captioner] 19:18:37
 INSTALLED AT A SITE OUR STUDIES SHOW

[Captioner] 19:18:40
 THAT ARE EXPECTED TO INCREASE SALES BY NEARLY 5% WHICH

[Captioner] 19:18:43
 IS A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER.
IF YOU LOOK

[Captioner] 19:18:47
 AT A SAMPLE

[Captioner] 19:18:51
 STORE, THAT IS $24,000 INCREASE PER ADDITIONAL SIGN

[Captioner] 19:18:54
 IN BUSINESS GENERATION.
THE KEY FACTOR FOR

[Captioner] 19:18:57
 CONSUMERS IS THAT SIGNS THAT ARE TOO SMALL OR

[Captioner] 19:19:04
 ILLEGIBLE CAN MEAN A MISS

[Captioner] 19:19:07
ED OPPORTUNITY AS CUSTOMERS DRIVER PAST WITHOUT LOCAT

[Captioner] 19:19:10
ING THE BUSINESS.
STATISTICS ON THE PROJECT,

[Captioner] 19:19:13
 SIGN QUALITY REALLY IMPACTS OUR ABILITY TO DRAW IN CUSTOMERS.
IN

[Captioner] 19:19:17
 OUR STUDY MORE THAN HALF OF

[Captioner] 19:19:20
 CONSUMERS SAY THEY HAVE DRIVEN BY AND FAIL TO FIND A BUSINESS BECAUSE

[Captioner] 19:19:23
 THE SIGN WAS TOO SMALL OR UNCLEAR.
A THIRD

[Captioner] 19:19:26
 OF THE CUSTOMERS SAY THEY HAVE BEEN DRAWN INTO UN

[Captioner] 19:19:30
 UNFAMILIAR STORES BASED ON QUALITY OF SIGNS

[Captioner] 19:19:34
 AND OTHERS SAY THEY

[Captioner] 19:19:37
 HAVE DIFFERENCE OF QUALITY OF BUSINESS.
WHAT CONSTITUTES THE SIGNAGE

[Captioner] 19:19:41
 THAT THE CONSUMERS LIKE?
WHY THE PAPE SIGN WORKS

[Captioner] 19:19:44
 IS THE LETTERS ARE LARGE AND EASILY

[Captioner] 19:19:48
 SPACED AND READABLE AND THERE IS A

[Captioner] 19:19:51
 HIGH CONTRAST, AND THERE ARE A NUMBER OF

[Captioner] 19:19:55
 CRITERIA, MAY BE HARD TO SEE ON

[Captioner] 19:19:59
 A ZOOM SCREEN BUT 83% SAY WHEN
LETTERS ARE TOO

[Captioner] 19:20:02
 SMALL IT MAKES A SIGN DIFFICULT TO READ

[Captioner] 19:20:05
, 72% SAY CORE PLACEMENT IS

[Captioner] 19:20:09
 A PROBLEM AND 64% SAY NOT SUFFICIENTLY LIT

[Captioner] 19:20:12
 AT NIGHT AND OUR ISSUE

[Captioner] 19:20:16
 IS DESIGNED TO ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS.

[Captioner] 19:20:19

SWITCHING TO THE SPECIFIC CONCERNS FROM THE LAST MEETING, THE FIRST 

[Captioner] 19:20:22
CONCERN THAT WAS EXPRESSED WAS SIGN HEIGHT AND SIZE AND WE APPRECIATE

[Captioner] 19:20:26
 THE FEEDBACK AND WE'VE LISTENED AND WE

[Captioner] 19:20:29
 HAVE CHANGED OUR
PROPOSAL AS JAMES AND DONOVAN

[Captioner] 19:20:33
 MENTIONED FROM 152 SQUARE FEET AT

[Captioner] 19:20:36
 44 FOOT OVERALL

[Captioner] 19:20:40
 HEIGHT, TO 44 FOOT OVERALL HEIGHT.
IF ALLOWED

[Captioner] 19:20:43
 AT A 35 FOOT

[Captioner] 19:20:46
 OVERALL HEIGHT, THE SIGN WOULD BE 17 FEET AT

[Captioner] 19:20:49
 ITS TOP IN VISIBILITY OF 680

[Captioner] 19:20:53
 OVER THE BARRIERS AT THE FREEWAY.
THE RENDERING

[Captioner] 19:20:56
 OF THE RIGHT SHOWS THE FORMER PROPOSAL AND IN THE

[Captioner] 19:20:59
 FOREGROUND THE SIGN WITH THE REVISE

[Captioner] 19:21:02
ED HEIGHT AND SIZE.
THE NEXT CONCERN THAT

[Captioner] 19:21:05
 WAS EXPRESSED WAS SETTING A PRECEDENCE AND WE

[Captioner] 19:21:08
 CERTAINLY RESPECT THAT.
AS MENTIONED, THERE IS A ONE MILE

[Captioner] 19:21:12
 CORRIDOR ALONG I 680

[Captioner] 19:21:15
 THAT IS ZONED INDUSTRIAL THAT COULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR SUCH SIGNS.
AND

[Captioner] 19:21:18
 CURRENTLY, ALL BUT ONE SITE IS DEVELOPED OUT PROPERTY

[Captioner] 19:21:21
.
THE ONE REMAINING UNDEVELOPED PROPERTY IN

[Captioner] 19:21:25
 THIS SECTOR IS HIGHLIGHTED IN GREEN, AND THAT'S

[Captioner] 19:21:28
 OUR PROPERTY FOR PAPE MACHINERY.


[Captioner] 19:21:34
WITH RESPECT TO ANOTHER CONCERN THAT WAS LIGHT POLLUTION I'D LIKE

[Captioner] 19:21:37
 TO FIRST START AT THE RIGHT-HAND SIDE OF THE SLIDE.
AS

[Captioner] 19:21:40
 JAMES MENTIONED IN OUR LAST COMMISSION MEETING THE SIGNAGE IS

[Captioner] 19:21:43
 ORIENTED TO FACE THE TRAFFIC THAT IS HEADED NORTH

[Captioner] 19:21:47
 AND SOUTHBOUND ON I 680 AND FACES

[Captioner] 19:21:50
 EDGE-ON TO THE FIRM DIRECTLY ACROSS THE FREEWAY.

[Captioner] 19:21:53

THE RIGHT-HAND PHOTO IS A PHOTO OF A SIMILAR SIGN AT

[Captioner] 19:21:56
 ANOTHER PAPE FACILITY THAT IS

[Captioner] 19:21:59
 SIMILARLY SITUATED AND YOU CAN SEE THE NARROW EDGE PROFILE

[Captioner] 19:22:02
 HERE THAT WOULD FACE FROM ACROSS THE FREEWAY.


[Captioner] 19:22:06
OUR PHOTO SURVEY BUILDING ON

[Captioner] 19:22:09
 WHAT JAMES HAD TO SAY, OUR PHOTO SURVEY THAT SHOWS THAT NONE

[Captioner] 19:22:13
 OF THE HOMES ON THE HILL ACROSS FROM 680 HAVE A

[Captioner] 19:22:16
 MEANINGFUL VIEW OF THE PROPERTY.
LIKE JAMES MENTION

[Captioner] 19:22:19
ED THAT IS EITHER DUE TO TALL CONCRETE NOISE

[Captioner] 19:22:22
 BARRIERS OR ALSO DUE TO HILLS TREES AND DISTANCE.

[Captioner] 19:22:25

ALSO I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT OF THE 120 SQUARE FOOT

[Captioner] 19:22:29
 IN SIGN FACE, ONLY 65 SQUARE FEET

[Captioner] 19:22:32
 OF THAT FACE IS ILLUMINATED.
THE REST

[Captioner] 19:22:35
 BEING AN OPAQUE AND BLACK BACKGROUND.
SO THE LIGHT

[Captioner] 19:22:39
ED PORTION IS RESTRICTED AS YOU SEE HERE TO THE LOGO

[Captioner] 19:22:42
 AND THE LETTERS BELOW.


[Captioner] 19:22:46
IMPACT ON NEIGHBORS WAS ALREADY COVERED.
WE HAVE REACHED OUT

[Captioner] 19:22:50
 AND RECEIVE NO OBJECTION FROM OUR NEIGHBORS TO THE SOUTH

[Captioner] 19:22:54
.
CIPs COMPANY AND THE NEIGHBORS TO THE

[Captioner] 19:22:58
 NORTH, THE ASSEMBLY HALL

[Captioner] 19:23:01
 OF JEHOVAH'S WITNESSES.

[Captioner] 19:23:05

I'LL SWITCH TO A VIDEO, IT MAY TAKE

[Captioner] 19:23:08
 TEN SECONDS FOR THE VIDEO TO LOAD, IF IT

[Captioner] 19:23:11
 DOES NOT WORK I WILL SWITCH TO STILLS.


[Captioner] 19:23:16
AND IF SOMEBODY CAN PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF THEY SEE THAT

[Captioner] 19:23:19
  PLAYING.


[Captioner] 19:23:33
>> Commissioner Daulton:   IT'S WORKING.
>> THANK YOU

[Captioner] 19:23:36

[Captioner] 19:25:14
 THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE, CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND CRITICAL

[Captioner] 19:25:18
 FACILITIES ACROSS THE REGION.
WE'RE GRATEFUL FOR

[Captioner] 19:25:21
 THE SUPPORT LIKE DONOVAN SAID, A

[Captioner] 19:25:24
 LABOR OF LOVE OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS, GRATEFUL FOR THE SUPPORT

[Captioner] 19:25:27
 OF CITY STAFF AND IT'S BEEN A CLOSE COLLABORATION

[Captioner] 19:25:30
 OVER THOSE YEARS WITH FREMONT
PLANNING AND

[Captioner] 19:25:34
 BUILDING DEPARTMENTS AND ECONOMIC REDEVELOPMENT AND WE'RE HAPPY TO SEE IT NEARLY

[Captioner] 19:25:37
 COME TO FRUITION.
AS WAS ALSO MENTIONED THIS LOCATION IS

[Captioner] 19:25:40
 THE FLAGSHIP DEALERSHIP FOR PAPE.
WE HAVE

[Captioner] 19:25:43
 FOOTPRINT IN NINE STATES PREDOMINANTLY CALIFORNIA AND

[Captioner] 19:25:46
 OREGON AND WASHINGTON AND THIS BY FAR IS THE SIGNATURE FACILITY FOR

[Captioner] 19:25:49
 OUR ENTIRE NETWORK AND WE'RE VERY PROUD TO HAVE

[Captioner] 19:25:52
 THAT IN FREMONT.
IN TERMS

[Captioner] 19:25:55
 OF GENERAL COMPLIANT COMPATIBILITY, OUR APPLICATION

[Captioner] 19:25:59
 SUPPORTS THE FOLLOWING FINDINGS REQUIRED FOR

[Captioner] 19:26:02

THE SITE

[Captioner] 19:26:15
 IS PHYSICALLY SUITABLE FOR THE TYPE AND DENSITY OF THE SIGN

[Captioner] 19:26:18
, IT'S SITUATED FACING THE FREEWAY NOT FACING

[Captioner] 19:26:23
 THE HILLS OR NEIGHBORHOODS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE FREEWAY.


[Captioner] 19:26:26
THE PORTION OF I 680 THAT IT'S ON IS NOT

[Captioner] 19:26:29
 DESIGNATED AS SCENIC HIGHWAY IN

[Captioner] 19:26:32
 THE GENERAL PLAN AND AS MENTIONED THE SITE ESTHETICS OF THE

[Captioner] 19:26:36
 PROPERTY ARE HIGHLY IMPACTED BY HIGH VOLTAGE POWER

[Captioner] 19:26:39
 LINES WITH
LARGE LAT ADVERTISE T

[Captioner] 19:26:42
 LATTICE TOWERS.
ALSO THE DESIGN LOCATION

[Captioner] 19:26:45
 AND SIZE OF THE PROPOSED USE ARE COMPATIBLE

[Captioner] 19:26:48
 WITH DEVELOPMENT IN THE VICINITY.
WITH RESPECT TO THE SIGN A 35

[Captioner] 19:26:52

[Captioner] 19:27:17
 PROPOSED SIGN HAS BEEN APPROVED BY CALTRANS

[Captioner] 19:27:21

[Captioner] 19:27:24
 RESOLUTION IS NOT

[Captioner] 19:27:28
 TO CREATE TO THE

[Captioner] 19:27:31
 SURROUNDING PROPERTIES.
IF PEOPLE WOULD LIKE TO

[Captioner] 19:27:34
 SEE MORE DRAWINGS OF HOW THE SIGN WILL APPEAR BUT OTHER THAN THAT

[Captioner] 19:27:38
 WE'LL OPEN UP TO QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 19:27:41

COMMISSIONERS ANY QUESTIONS FOR THE APPLICANT AT THIS TIME?


[Captioner] 19:27:48
SEEING NO HANDS FROM THE COMMISSION, TRISH

[Captioner] 19:27:51
 DO WE HAVE ANY PUBLIC COMMENT?
>> Trish Cordova:  

[Captioner] 19:27:55
 CHAIR DAULTON WE DO HAVE RAISED HANDS.
I HAVE ONE

[Captioner] 19:27:58
 SPEAKER.
HOW MANY MINUTES MAY

[Captioner] 19:28:01
 THE SPEAKER HAVE?
>> Commissioner Daulton:   THREE MINUTES.


[Captioner] 19:28:04
>> Trish Cordova:   THREE MINUTES SO

[Captioner] 19:28:07
 LEGALITY ME GO AHEAD AND INTRODUCE THE FIRST SPEAKER.

[Captioner] 19:28:11

KELLY A, I'M GOING TO ALLOW YOU TO SPEAK

[Captioner] 19:28:14
.
GO AHEAD KELLY YOU CAN SPEAK  NOW.


[Captioner] 19:28:22
KELLY?
GO AHEAD AND SPEAK.

[Captioner] 19:28:25

>> GO AHEAD, ALL RIGHT.
THIS MORNING

[Captioner] 19:28:29
, ALAMEDA COUNTY DID THE EXACT SAME THING AS WHAT YOU

[Captioner] 19:28:32
 WERE DOING EXCEPT THEY SPENT OVER AN HOUR ON IT AND THEY

[Captioner] 19:28:35
 HAD LAWYERS, THEY HAD COMMUNITY PEOPLE, AND PEOPLE

[Captioner] 19:28:38
 WERE -- IT WAS -- IT'S AN
INCREDIBLE --

[Captioner] 19:28:42
 WHAT I LEARNED FROM THIS, IT IS INCREDIBLY --

[Captioner] 19:28:45
 THIS IS HAPPENING IN ASHLAND

[Captioner] 19:28:48
, CHERRYLAND HAYWARD THERE RIGHT NEXT TO A FREEWAY

[Captioner] 19:28:52
.
THIS PROJECT RIGHT NEXT OA FREEWAY.


[Captioner] 19:28:55
BUT THIS PROJECT IF YOU LOOK AT THE LAWS AND WHAT I LEARNED THIS MORNING

[Captioner] 19:28:58
 IS THESE LAWS ARE VERY COMPLICATED, THEY ARE VERY

[Captioner] 19:29:01
 -- AND IF YOU REALLY LOOK AT THIS PROJECT AND SEE HOW

[Captioner] 19:29:04
 IT ALIGNS WITH THE LAWS
IT'S ACTUALLY NOT BAD.


[Captioner] 19:29:08
IT KIND OF ALIGNS.
AND

[Captioner] 19:29:11
 THEN IF YOU LISTEN TO THIS GENTLEMAN WHO'S JUST SPEAKING

[Captioner] 19:29:16
, THE -- WHAT

[Captioner] 19:29:19
 SEEMS LIKE A  RESPECTABLE PERSON AS POAPPED TO

[Captioner] 19:29:22
 THE LAWYERS WHO WERE DEFENDING

[Captioner] 19:29:25
 THE ELECTRIC SIGNS IN CHERRYLAND

[Captioner] 19:29:28
 OR
WHENEVER.
THE OTHER PEOPLE IN THE COUNTY ARE 

[Captioner] 19:29:32
CERTAINLY LESS TRUSS WORTHY THAN THE PEOPLE SPEAKING HERE.
AND

[Captioner] 19:29:36
 THEN BUT THERE IS ONE AND I DO HAVE

[Captioner] 19:29:40
 A KNIT TO PICK ABOUT THIS.
THE

[Captioner] 19:29:43
 SIMULATION ABOUT DRIVING DOWN THE TREE WAY SO I

[Captioner] 19:29:47
 LOOKED AT PICTURES OF GOOGLE DRIVING DOWN THE

[Captioner] 19:29:50
 FREEWAY A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO.
IT IS NOT WHAT YOU SEE

[Captioner] 19:29:53
 AT THE LEFT NEAR THE SIGN WHICH SEEMS TO BE LEGALLY

[Captioner] 19:29:56
 PERMITTED BY THE WAY.
ON THE RIGHT-HAND SIDE YOU

[Captioner] 19:29:59
 SEE SOMETHING THAT IS A DIGITAL SIMULATION OF AN APARTMENT

[Captioner] 19:30:02
 BUILDING ON AN OFFICE BUILDING

[Captioner] 19:30:05
 OR WHATEVER OVER BY DURHAM AND  680.
THAT

[Captioner] 19:30:09
 THING DOES NOT EXIST.
THAT IS A PURE -- IT IS AN

[Captioner] 19:30:12
 MAN NEAR THING.
IT IS AN UGLY CONCRETE MONSTROSITY

[Captioner] 19:30:15
.
AND THE PLANNING STAFF IN THIS ROOM NEED TO TAKE

[Captioner] 19:30:19
 RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT THE DIFFERENCE -- FOR WHAT YOU SEE

[Captioner] 19:30:22
 ON THE GROUND  THERE, ON GOOGLE, AND

[Captioner] 19:30:26
 WHAT THE NICE PRETTY SIMULATION AND THIS THING HAS
BEEN

[Captioner] 19:30:29
 GOING ON THIS BUILDING PROJECT FOR FIVE YEARS.
AND IT'S

[Captioner] 19:30:32
 NOW STUCK.
AND FREMONT NEEDS TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR

[Captioner] 19:30:35
 THAT.
I SUPPORT THIS PROJECT.
FREMONT NEEDS TO

[Captioner] 19:30:39
 CLEAN UP THE OTHER SIDE OF THE FREEWAY.
THIS SIGN THAT YOU'RE PUTTING

[Captioner] 19:30:42
 UP SEEMS TO BE LEGAL AND, YOU KNOW,

[Captioner] 19:30:45
 AND I DUG DEEP.
VERY DEEP INTO

[Captioner] 19:30:49
 THE SIGN LAWS.
JUST BY THE WAY, YOU KNOW

[Captioner] 19:30:52
 WHO IS THE KEY FIGURE IN FREEWAY LAWS OF SIGNS

[Captioner] 19:30:55
 IN AMERICA?
THE KEY FIGURE IS

[Captioner] 19:30:58
 LADY BIRD JOHNSON IN 1967.
SHE

[Captioner] 19:31:02
 IS LEGENDARY.
SHE IS THE ONE WHO SAVED AMERICAN FREEWAYS

[Captioner] 19:31:06
 FROM HAVING SIGNS EVERYWHERE.
THANK YOU

[Captioner] 19:31:09
.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   THANK YOU, KELLY.


[Captioner] 19:31:14
SO I GUESS I COULD ASK THE APPLICANT IF THEY HAVE

[Captioner] 19:31:17
 ANYTHING TO SAY IN CLOSING, OR

[Captioner] 19:31:20
 IF THE COMMISSIONERS HAVE ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS FOR THE APPLICANT

[Captioner] 19:31:24
?
NO

[Captioner] 19:31:27
?
OKAY.
ANY DISCUSSION ON THIS ITEM

[Captioner] 19:31:30
  BY -- I'M GOING TO CLOSE THE PUBLIC HEARING

[Captioner] 19:31:33
 THEN AND ASK FOR DISCUSSION BY THE COMMISSION ON THIS ITEM.


[Captioner] 19:31:38
ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMISSIONER

[Captioner] 19:31:41
S?
PLEASE.


[Captioner] 19:31:44
COMMISSIONER YEE, YES.


[Captioner] 19:31:47
>> Commissioner Yee:   IT IS COMMISSIONER LIU.


[Captioner] 19:31:52
NO THIS TIME IT'S COMMISSIONER YEE

[Captioner] 19:31:55
.
YOU'RE NEXT.
YOU'LL BE NEXT .

[Captioner] 19:31:58

>> Commissioner Daulton:   COME BACK TO YOU CHARLES.


[Captioner] 19:32:01
>> Commissioner Yee:   SO I HAD A CHANCE TO ACTUALLY DRIVE THIS 6

[Captioner] 19:32:04
80 STRETCH TO TAKE A LOOK AT YOUR RENDERING.
AND I

[Captioner] 19:32:07
 APPRECIATE ALL THE THOUGHTFULNESS THAT YOU PUT WITH

[Captioner] 19:32:11
 THE VIDEO, THE PICTURES AND ALL OF THAT.

[Captioner] 19:32:14

BUT ONE THING I DID NOTICE IN YOUR RENDERING THROUGH THE

[Captioner] 19:32:17
 VIDEO IS THAT THE PAPE SIGN THAT'S ON THE BACK SIDE OF

[Captioner] 19:32:21
 THE BUILDING THAT'S FACING 680 I COULD CLEARLY SEE IT

[Captioner] 19:32:24
 AS I'M DRIVING  BY.

[Captioner] 19:32:27

SO I'M JUST WONDERING AT LEAST FOR ME, TO HAVE

[Captioner] 19:32:31
 THIS ADDITIONAL BILLBOARD WHERE I COULD

[Captioner] 19:32:34
 ALSO SEE THAT THERE'S A PAPE SIGN ALREADY ON YOUR

[Captioner] 19:32:37
 BUILDING AS I'M DRIVING SOUTHBOUND AND

[Captioner] 19:32:40
 ESPECIALLY WHEN I GO
NORTHBOUND I COULD SEE THAT PAPE SIGN VERY CLEARLY

[Captioner] 19:32:44
.
SO I JUST WANTED TO BE ABLE TO SHAISH

[Captioner] 19:32:47
 SHARE THAT WITH THE REST OF THE COMMISSION

[Captioner] 19:32:51
 THAT DIDN'T HAVE A CHANCE TO GO UP AND DOWN THAT  680 STRETCH

[Captioner] 19:32:54
 TO TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT THE BACK SIDE OF THAT

[Captioner] 19:32:58

BUILDING IS FACING

[Captioner] 19:33:02
 THE FREEWAY.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   I I WELL SAY WE

[Captioner] 19:33:05
 HAVE CLOSED THE PUBLIC HEARING, THIS IS A

[Captioner] 19:33:09
 DISCUSSION AMONG THE COMMISSIONERS AND NO LONGER A QUESTION FOR THE APPLICANT

[Captioner] 19:33:12
.
>> Commissioner Yee:   RIGHT, I'M JUST SHARING WITH THE REST

[Captioner] 19:33:15
 OF THE COMMISSION THAT THAT'S WHAT I SAW AS I'M DRIVING

[Captioner] 19:33:18
 UP AND DOWN 680, I HAD TO DO IT FOUR

[Captioner] 19:33:21
 TIMES TO VERIFY I COULD SEE THE SIGN AND WHAT
RENDERINGS

[Captioner] 19:33:25
 DID THEY HAVE OVER THERE TO ENSURE WHAT WAS BEING

[Captioner] 19:33:28
 PRESENTED TO US TONIGHT.


[Captioner] 19:33:31
>> Commissioner Daulton:   OKAY, THANK YOU COMMISSIONER YEE.
COMMISSIONER LIU

[Captioner] 19:33:34
, PLEASE.
>> Commissioner Liu:   YES SO I THINK THE

[Captioner] 19:33:37
 ONLY OTHER SIGNS

[Captioner] 19:33:41
 OF A COMPARABLE SIZE WAS

[Captioner] 19:33:45
 THE FRY'S

[Captioner] 19:33:48
 ELECTRONICS SIGN WHEN IT WAS STILL IN BUSINESS.
AND I WONDER IF IT

[Captioner] 19:33:51
 WAS EVER DESIGNED, THE FRY

[Captioner] 19:33:55
'S SIGNS WERE EVER ILLUMINATED?
DO WE

[Captioner] 19:33:58
 -- I DON'T QUITE REMEMBER.
CAN THE STAFF OR

[Captioner] 19:34:01
 SOMEONE TELL  ME?
>> Commissioner Yee:   YES, THEY WERE

[Captioner] 19:34:05
 ILLUMINATED.
>> Commissioner Liu:   OKAY

[Captioner] 19:34:08
.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   BUT THE FRIDAY'S SIGNS WERE NOT DIRECTLY ON 

[Captioner] 19:34:12
THE FREEWAY, I DON'T THINK

[Captioner] 19:34:15
.
>> Commissioner Yee:   THAT'S CORRECT, THEY'RE ON THE  BUILDING.


[Captioner] 19:34:18
>> Commissioner Daulton:   ANY OTHER QUESTIONS?
I'M LOOK

[Captioner] 19:34:21
ING AT THIS PROJECT, AND I'M STILL SEEING IT AS

[Captioner] 19:34:24
 A PRECEDENT, TO WHAT STAFF MENTIONED THAT

[Captioner] 19:34:27
 THERE ARE TEN POTENTIAL SITES THAT COULD HAVE THIS TYPE

[Captioner] 19:34:31
 OF SIGNAGE AGAINST THE FREEWAY.


[Captioner] 19:34:34
I DON'T KNOW, I HONESTLY, TO

[Captioner] 19:34:37
 ME WE HAVE A SOMEWHAT

[Captioner] 19:34:41
 UNENCUMBERED STRETCH OF FREEWAY HERE, I

[Captioner] 19:34:44
 THINK TO A CERTAIN EXTENT WE SHOULD YOU

[Captioner] 19:34:47
 KNOW PROTECT THAT.

[Captioner] 19:34:50

THERE ARE TOWNS ALL OVER THE PENINSULA

[Captioner] 19:34:54
 THAT DISALLOW THIS KIND OF SIGNAGE NEXT TO THE FREEWAY

[Captioner] 19:34:58
 BECAUSE THE SURROUNDING LANDSCAPE

[Captioner] 19:35:02
 IS PICTURESQUE AND WHETHER OR NOT THERE

[Captioner] 19:35:05
 IS AN ACTUAL SCENE

[Captioner] 19:35:08
IC
DESIGNATION TO THE HIGHWAY, I

[Captioner] 19:35:11
 DON'T THINK ANYONE WOULD DISAGREE THIS IS A

[Captioner] 19:35:14
 LOVELY STRETCH OF ROAD.
YES COMMISSIONER YEE PLEASE.
>> Commissioner Yee:  

[Captioner] 19:35:18
 I ONLY WANT TO REINFORCE WHAT YOU ARE SAYING BECAUSE I BELIEVE

[Captioner] 19:35:21
 THE SAME THING TOO, THAT THIS WOULD SET

[Captioner] 19:35:24
 A PRECEDENCE BECAUSE IF THIS SIGN GOES IN THERE

[Captioner] 19:35:27
 WOULD BE OTHERS THAT
PEOPLE WOULD BE APPLYING FOR AS WELL.
AS I

[Captioner] 19:35:30
 SAID EARLIER THEY ALREADY HAVE A SIGN THAT IS ON THE BACK SIDE OF THAT

[Captioner] 19:35:34
 BUILDING THAT IS ALREADY FACING 680.
AND I WOULD THINK

[Captioner] 19:35:37
 THAT MOST PEOPLE, YOU KNOW, WOULD BE USING THEIR

[Captioner] 19:35:40
 GPS ANY

[Captioner] 19:35:44
HOW TO FIND THE LOCATION OF THIS FACILITY WHICH I WILL REINFORCE

[Captioner] 19:35:48
 ABSOLUTELY LOOKS YOU BEAUTIFUL AND IT WAS DONE
VERY NICE

[Captioner] 19:35:51
LY.
BUT AS YOU COME DOWN OSGOOD

[Captioner] 19:35:55
 YOU CAN'T MISS IT.
AND EVEN WHEN I WAS ON 6

[Captioner] 19:35:58
80 GOING NORTH AND SOUTHBOUND YOU CAN'T MISS IT.
YOU

[Captioner] 19:36:01
 CAN SEE THE EQUIPMENT WHAT'S BACK THERE, YOU HAVE AN

[Captioner] 19:36:04
 IDEA WHAT IT IS AND ESPECIALLY WITH THAT PAPE SIGN THAT IS ALREADY

[Captioner] 19:36:07
 IN THE BACK YOU COULD SEE IT EITHER NORTH

[Captioner] 19:36:10
 OR SOUTHBOUND ALREADY.


[Captioner] 19:36:13
>> Planner Pullen:   CHAIR I'D LIKE TO CLARIFY SOMETHING THAT YOU

[Captioner] 19:36:16
 SAID DURING THE COMMENTS.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   GO AHEAD JOEL.

[Captioner] 19:36:20

>> Planner Pullen:   ONE OF THE SIGNS THAT COMMISSIONER YEE USED

[Captioner] 19:36:23
 WAS BILLBOARD.
I DO WANT TO DRAW A DISTINCTION BETWEEN THIS SIGN

[Captioner] 19:36:26
 AND THE B

[Captioner] 19:36:29
 BILLBOARD.
THE CITY DOESN'T HAVE ANY BILLBOARDS THAT HAVE BEEN

[Captioner] 19:36:33
 APPROVED IN THE LAST LONG LONG LONG TIME, YEARS.
A

[Captioner] 19:36:36
 BILLBOARD IS SOMETHING THAT PROVIDES OFFSITE ADVERTISING, IT IS

[Captioner] 19:36:39
 A DISTINCTIVE SEPARATE USE OF

[Captioner] 19:36:42
 PROPERTY THAT'S INTENDED FOR, YOU KNOW,

[Captioner] 19:36:46
 GENERAL MESSAGES LIKE YOU SEE IN NEWARK ON 880

[Captioner] 19:36:49
 AND
ON 84, ET CETERA.
THEY HAD A DEAL WITH THE

[Captioner] 19:36:52
 BILLBOARD COMPANY IN THAT RESPECT.
THIS SIGN WOULD BE RESTRICTED

[Captioner] 19:36:55
 TO ONSITE ADVERTISING AND ISN'T CONSIDERED A BILLBOARD

[Captioner] 19:36:59
 AS OUR SIGN CODE DESCRIBES IT.
IT'S NOT CHANGEABILITY

[Captioner] 19:37:02
 IN THAT SENSE WHERE IT CYCLES

[Captioner] 19:37:06
 CYCLES MESSAGES THAT CAN VARY.
AND

[Captioner] 19:37:09
 SO I DON'T KNOW IF THE COMMISSION CAN

[Captioner] 19:37:12
 CONSIDER THAT THIS ISN'T -- ISN'T AS

[Captioner] 19:37:15
 INTRUSIVE AS THAT TYPE OF SIGN.
THE OTHER THING I

[Captioner] 19:37:19
 DID WANT TO MENTION IS,

[Captioner] 19:37:22
 AND DONOVAN AND THE APPLICANT AND JAMES ALL SORT OF

[Captioner] 19:37:26
 MENTIONED THIS.
THE LAST TIME WE HAD A PRETTY ROBUST

[Captioner] 19:37:29
 DISCUSSION ABOUT 680 UP AND DOWN

[Captioner] 19:37:33
 THE RIGHT-OF-WAY IN FREMONT ALL THE WAY DOWN

[Captioner] 19:37:37
 TO MISSION MCDONALD AND THE

[Captioner] 19:37:41
 CREEK AND THINKING OF WHERE THIS SIGN MIGHT GO

[Captioner] 19:37:44
.
I DO NOTE THAT THOSE ZONING DISTRICTS DON'T

[Captioner] 19:37:47
 ALLOW SIGNS.
THE ONLY ZONING DISTRICT THAT IS UP AGAINST THE

[Captioner] 19:37:50
 FREEWAY STRETCHES FROM THE STORAGE PLACE AT THE CURVE

[Captioner] 19:37:53
 OF 680 JUST NORTH OF THE PAPE SIGN TO

[Captioner] 19:37:56
 WESTERN DIGITAL.
AND THE POINT OF THE APPLICATION

[Captioner] 19:37:59
 WAS THAT IN TERMS OF SETTING PRECEDENT, THOSE

[Captioner] 19:38:03
 OTHER SITES, AGAIN NOT

[Captioner] 19:38:07
 INCLUDING FRY'S WHICH IS COMMERCIAL, THOSE OTHER

[Captioner] 19:38:10
 SITES AREN'T SITUATED SUCH THAT A SIGN IS

[Captioner] 19:38:13

APPROPRIATE AND DON'T HAVE THE CONSTRAINTS THAT THIS

[Captioner] 19:38:16
 SIGN, THIS SITE HAS.
SO THAT'S MY

[Captioner] 19:38:19
 SORT OF WRAP-UP ON THE CASE FOR

[Captioner] 19:38:23
 THE RECOMMENDATION.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   THANK YOU JOEL

[Captioner] 19:38:26
.
COMMISSIONER BASRAI.
>> Commissioner Basrai:   AND JUST 

[Captioner] 19:38:29
SPEAKING IN TERMS OF PRECEDENT, MY CONCERN IS, YOU KNOW,

[Captioner] 19:38:32
 WE ARE TRYING TO MAKE

[Captioner] 19:38:36
 ACCOMMODATION OF A CITY THAT IS BUSINESS FRIENDLY AND FAMILY

[Captioner] 19:38:39
 FRIENDLY.
AND IF WE'RE GOODS TO SET PRECEDENTS THAT

[Captioner] 19:38:42
 YOU CAN'T ADVERTISE YOUR OWN BUSINESS ON YOUR OWN

[Captioner] 19:38:45
 LAND IS MY CONCERN ABOUT THIS.
I THINK THE APPLICANT HAS DONE A

[Captioner] 19:38:48
 REALLY GOOD JOB IN ADDRESSING THEIR

[Captioner] 19:38:52
 CONCERNS THAT WE HAD.
I MEAN WE ALSO HAVE

[Captioner] 19:38:56
 LIKE ELECTRICAL LINES THERE, THAT'S NOT VERY PRETTY EITHER.
SO PUTTING

[Captioner] 19:38:59
 UP A SIGN IS, TO

[Captioner] 19:39:02
 ME JUST PART OF DOING BUSINESS.


[Captioner] 19:39:06
AND, YOU KNOW, WE LET

[Captioner] 19:39:10
 THE ELECTRICAL LINES GO UP THERE.
SO I DON'T UNDERSTAND --

[Captioner] 19:39:13
 MY CONCERN IS THAT OTHER BUSINESSES THAT MAY MOVE IN WHEN

[Captioner] 19:39:16
 LET'S SAY ONE OF THE OTHER NEIGHBORS MOVES OUR, WILL WE

[Captioner] 19:39:20
 BE SET BEING A PRECEDENT THAT

[Captioner] 19:39:23
 WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE GETTING

[Captioner] 19:39:26

SOMEBODY WHO COMES IN THAT WILL BE PROVIDING THE SAME KIND OF

[Captioner] 19:39:30
 ECONOMIC SUPPORT FOR FREMONT WHICH ONE OF THESE BUSINESSES IS

[Captioner] 19:39:33
, BECAUSE THEY'RE SCARED THEY CAN'T PUT UP A SIGN THAT

[Captioner] 19:39:36
 THEY'RE HERE.
SO THAT'S MY CONCERN, IS SAYING

[Captioner] 19:39:39
, WE'RE SETTING A PRECEDENT THAT WE CAN

[Captioner] 19:39:42
 -- LIKE JOEL SAID IT'S NOT A BILLBOARD.

[Captioner] 19:39:45

IT IS ADVERTISING YOUR BUSINESS ON YOUR LAND WHERE YOU

[Captioner] 19:39:49
 HAVE ABSOLUTE -- YOU HAVE AUTHORITY OVER JUST BECAUSE IT

[Captioner] 19:39:52
 OVERLOOKS A FREEWAY, IS MY CONCERN

[Captioner] 19:39:56
 THAT SOMEBODY ELSE WOULD BE

[Captioner] 19:39:59
 REMISS TO WANT TO TAKE
THE PROPERTY MOVING FORWARD.
THAT'S

[Captioner] 19:40:02
 ONE OF MY CONCERNS BY SAYING, YOU KNOW, THIS IS A FREEWAY

[Captioner] 19:40:07
 PRECEDENT.
THIS IS MORE OF A PRPBILITY THAT WE'RE SETTING

[Captioner] 19:40:10
 FOR BUSINESSES, YOU CAN'T ADVERTISE ON YOUR OWN PIECE OF PROPERTY

[Captioner] 19:40:13
.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   THANK YOU

[Captioner] 19:40:17
.
MR. 

[Captioner] 19:40:22
ZHANG PLEASE.

[Captioner] 19:40:30

>> Commissioner Zhang:   MY CONCERN IS, I PERSONALLY DON'T HAVE

[Captioner] 19:40:33
 PROBLEMS PUTTING THE SIGN ON OSGOOD SIDE WHICH IS

[Captioner] 19:40:38
 LESS TRAFFIC OF COURSE.
BUT THE PROBLEM HERE

[Captioner] 19:40:41
 FOR ME IS THAT

[Captioner] 19:40:45
 IN IT KIND OF AS

[Captioner] 19:40:48
 A PER SIGN PROPERTY, I ALSO VISITED THE

[Captioner] 19:40:51
 MCDONALD SIGN AS WELL.
I DON'T THINK ANY -- WE

[Captioner] 19:40:55
 CAN SEE THE MCDONALD SIGN FROM 680 AT ALL

[Captioner] 19:40:58
.
THIS IS -- IF THIS SIGN SET UP IT

[Captioner] 19:41:02
 WOULD BE DEFINITELY THE FIRST ONE THAT I

[Captioner] 19:41:05
 -- I HAVE PASSED BY THAT SITE MANY TIMES AFTER

[Captioner] 19:41:08
 THIS FEBRUARY MEETING.
THIS GOING

[Captioner] 19:41:11
 TO HAVE SOME

[Captioner] 19:41:15
 LIKE I REALLY WANT TO PRESERVE THIS KIND

[Captioner] 19:41:19
 OF A SIGNAGE

[Captioner] 19:41:22
 FACTOR OF 680, NEVER BEEN

[Captioner] 19:41:25
, FIRST ONE I HAVE HAD

[Captioner] 19:41:28
 A CERTAINLY FOR.
THANK YOU.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   THANK YOU

[Captioner] 19:41:31
.
COMMISSIONER STECKLER PLEASE.
>> Commissioner Steckler:   THANK 

[Captioner] 19:41:34
YOU.
I AGREE WITH COMMISSIONER  BASRAI.

[Captioner] 19:41:37

HER COMMENTS.
AND I WOULD SAY THAT WHEN THIS FIRST 

[Captioner] 19:41:40
CAME TO US IN FEBRUARY,

[Captioner] 19:41:44
 WE VOICED OUR CONCERNS AND OBJECTION

[Captioner] 19:41:47
S.
AND I THINK THAT

[Captioner] 19:41:51
 THIS, THE LAND OWNER OR BUSINESS OWNER AND THE

[Captioner] 19:41:54
 STAFF WENT BACK AND DID A COMMENDABLE

[Captioner] 19:41:57
 JOB IN ADDRESSING THE CONCERNS THAT WE BROUGHT FORWARD

[Captioner] 19:42:01
.
A GUESS THE BEAUTY

[Captioner] 19:42:05
 IS IN THE EYE OF THE BEHOLDER BUT THAT STRETCH OF

[Captioner] 19:42:08
 680 IS NOT WHAT I WOULD CALL BEAUTIFUL.


[Captioner] 19:42:11
IT'S A FREEWAY.
WITH

[Captioner] 19:42:14
 155,000 CARS A DAY GOING DOWN IT

[Captioner] 19:42:18
.
AT ABOUT 70 OR 75 MILES AN

[Captioner] 19:42:21
 HOUR.
AND I DON'T THINK

[Captioner] 19:42:24
 THEY'RE LOOKING AT TREES AND BUSHES.
I THINK THEY'RE

[Captioner] 19:42:27
 LOOKING AHEAD.
SO

[Captioner] 19:42:31
 ALTHOUGH CERTAINLY HAS TREES AND PLANTS AND SO ON,

[Captioner] 19:42:34
 SO FORTH, BUT I

[Captioner] 19:42:37
 THINK THE APPLICANT DID A COMMENDABLE

[Captioner] 19:42:40
 JOB.
I THINK THAT THE

[Captioner] 19:42:44
 APPLICANT EXPLAINED THE

[Captioner] 19:42:48
 IMPORTANCE TO THEIR

[Captioner] 19:42:52
 BUSINESS THAT THAT SIGN WILL PROVIDE.

[Captioner] 19:42:56

AND OUR OWN STAFF AND

[Captioner] 19:42:59
 ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT

[Captioner] 19:43:02
 BROUGHT FORWARD SOME GOOD INFORMATION ABOUT THE ECONOMIC IMPACTS

[Captioner] 19:43:05
 OF THIS.
SO, YOU KNOW, AT THIS POINT

[Captioner] 19:43:09
 I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THE INSTALLATION OF THE SIGN

[Captioner] 19:43:13
.
SO BUT THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK.

[Captioner] 19:43:14

>> Commissioner Daulton:   THANK YOU COMMISSIONER.


[Captioner] 19:43:19
ANY OTHER COMMENTS BY THE COMMISSION, PLEASE

[Captioner] 19:43:22
?
COMMISSIONER LIU PLEASE.
GO AHEAD.


[Captioner] 19:43:25
>> Commissioner Liu:   OKAY.
I LEARNED SOMETHING NEW TODAY ABOUT EACH

[Captioner] 19:43:28
 ADDITIONAL SIGN THAT THE BUSINESS PUT UP

[Captioner] 19:43:32
 WOULD GENERATE 4.75%

[Captioner] 19:43:35
 MORE BUSINESS, THAT'S WONDERFUL.
I THINK AS

[Captioner] 19:43:38
 A GOOD TAXPAYER AND REVENUE GENERATOR FOR

[Captioner] 19:43:42
 CITY OF FREMONT, THAT SEEMS TO BE A

[Captioner] 19:43:45
 GOOD THING FOR THEM TO DO.


[Captioner] 19:43:48
HOWEVER, I DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS

[Captioner] 19:43:52
 ABOUT ILLUMINATED

[Captioner] 19:43:55
 SIGNS MAKING THIS PART OF 680

[Captioner] 19:43:58
 TOO  COMMERCIAL-LOOKING.
I JUST LIKE TO MAINTAIN

[Captioner] 19:44:03
 THE EXISTING

[Captioner] 19:44:08
 MORE QUOTE UNQUOTE  RULE, UNDEVELOPED, QUOTE

[Captioner] 19:44:11
  UNQUOTE, UNDEVELOPABLE PART OF THE

[Captioner] 19:44:14
 FREEWAY AT LEAST AT KNIGHT.


[Captioner] 19:44:17
 NIGHT.
SO IF WE CAN FIND A

[Captioner] 19:44:20
 MIDDLE GROUND BY MAKING AN AMENDMENT TO GET RID

[Captioner] 19:44:23
 OF THE ILLUMINATION I WOULD SUPPORT IT.


[Captioner] 19:44:28
>> Commissioner Daulton:   ANY OTHER COMMENTS?
THANK YOU SIR.


[Captioner] 19:44:33
IF THERE ARE NO OTHER COMMENTS, I'M GOING TO ASK

[Captioner] 19:44:36
 FOR A ROLL CALL VOTE.
IF I CAN GET A

[Captioner] 19:44:40
 MOTION.
CAN I GET A MOTION?


[Captioner] 19:44:46
>> Commissioner Liu:   WELL, I WOULD MOVE TO

[Captioner] 19:44:51
 AMEND THE STAFF

[Captioner] 19:44:54
'S RECOMMENDATION TO ELIMINATE THE

[Captioner] 19:44:57
 ILLUMINATION.
OKAY, JOEL

[Captioner] 19:45:00
?
>> Planner Pullen:   YES, CHAIR, IF -- I WOULD RECOMMEND THAT

[Captioner] 19:45:03
 IF WE DO

[Captioner] 19:45:07
 ASK THE APPLICANT TO DO SOMETHING, I THINK WE SHOULD CHECK

[Captioner] 19:45:10
 IN WITH THE APPLICANT TO SEE IF THEY WOULD BE WILLING TO ACCEPT

[Captioner] 19:45:13
 THAT
OR NOT.
WHICH COULD INFORM

[Captioner] 19:45:17
 YOUR OPTIONS NIGHT.
IF YOU MAKE

[Captioner] 19:45:21
 A RECOMMENDATION OF SOMETHING

[Captioner] 19:45:24
 THEY'RE UNWILLING TO DO, WELL, CAN YOU DO THAT.
IT'S UP

[Captioner] 19:45:27
 TO YOU.

[Captioner] 19:45:30

AND WE'LL SEE WHERE THE VOTE GOES, I GUESS.


[Captioner] 19:45:37
>> Commissioner Liu:   SO DOES IT MEAN WE CAN BRING THE APPLICANT BACK

[Captioner] 19:45:40
?
>> Commissioner Daulton:   WE HAVE A MOTION --

[Captioner] 19:45:43

>> Planner Pullen:   GO AHEAD.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   WE DO HAVE 

[Captioner] 19:45:46

 ILLUMINATED ASPECT OF THIS SIGN

[Captioner] 19:45:59
.
IS THERE A SECOND?

[Captioner] 19:46:06
>> Commissioner Daulton:   SECONDED BY COMMISSIONER BASRAI.

[Captioner] 19:46:09

JOEL WHY DON'T YOU GIVE US A ROLL CALL VOTE ON THIS.


[Captioner] 19:46:13
>> Planner Pullen:   WHEN YOU HEAR YOUR NAME ON THE MOTION TO APPROVE

[Captioner] 19:46:16
 THE RECOMMENDATION,

[Captioner] 19:46:20
 WITH THE PROVISO THAT THE SIGN NOT

[Captioner] 19:46:23
 BE ILLUMINATED AT NIGHT, IS IT AT NIGHT OR AT ALL

[Captioner] 19:46:26
?
>> Commissioner Liu:   THAT MEANS NO ILLUMINATION.


[Captioner] 19:46:29
DURING THE DAY I DON'T SEE A REASON TO ILLUMINATE

[Captioner] 19:46:32
 IT.
>> Planner Pullen:   OKAY.

 CAN WORK OUT A NONILLUMINATE

[Captioner] 19:49:12
ED SIGN.
AND IF THERE'S ANY CHANCE TO

[Captioner] 19:49:15
 MAYBE REDUCE IT ANY FURTHER THAN THEY HAVE SO FAR, AND

 THE APPLICANT TO ASSESS THE

[Captioner] 19:50:03
 FEASIBILITY OF AN UNLIT SIGN.
AND WE HAVE A

[Captioner] 19:50:07
 SECOND FROM COMMISSIONER LIU I DO BELIEVE

[Captioner] 19:50:11
.
>> Commissioner Yee:   I THINK JOEL HAD HIS HAND UP.


[Captioner] 19:50:14
>> Planner Pullen:   CHAIR.
I WANT TO STATE, THE APPLICANT

[Captioner] 19:50:17
 HAS STATED TO US THAT THEY WOULD LIKE A DECISION BY

[Captioner] 19:50:20
 THE COMMISSION TONIGHT.
YOU'RE IN YOUR

[Captioner] 19:50:23
 PURVIEW TO TAKE A VARIETY OF ACTIONS.
JUST NOTE

[Captioner] 19:50:26
 THAT WE SENT THE APPLICANT TO DO WORK IN FEBRUARY I

[Captioner] 19:50:30
 BELIEVE AND IT'S BEEN ABOUT TEN MONTHS.
I THINK

[Captioner] 19:50:33
 IT'S -- IT WOULD BE

[Captioner] 19:50:37
 REASONABLE TO ASK THE APPLICANT IF THEY ARE OPEN

[Captioner] 19:50:40
 TO A FELON ILLUMINATED SIGN

[Captioner] 19:50:47
  NONILLUMINATE

[Captioner] 19:50:50
ED SIGN, THEY DO HAVE SOME DESIRE

[Captioner] 19:50:53
 TO MOVE FORWARD ONE WAY OR THE OTHER.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   LET ME

[Captioner] 19:50:57
 UNDERSTAND, YOU WANT US TO BRING THE

[Captioner] 19:51:01
 PUBLIC MEETING BACK AND SPEAK TO THE APPLICANT AT THIS POINT

[Captioner] 19:51:03
?
>> Planner Pullen:   I THINK IT'S PRUDENT.


[Captioner] 19:51:06
>> Commissioner Daulton:   I'M GOING TO REOPEN THE PUBLIC MEETING FOR THE MOMENT SO

[Captioner] 19:51:10
 WE CAN ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF THE LIT SIGN

[Captioner] 19:51:13
 TO THE APPLICANT PLEASE, SOMEONE FROM PAPE TO SPEAK

[Captioner] 19:51:16
 TO US ON THAT.
>> YES, THANK YOU COMMISSIONER.
WE WOULD

[Captioner] 19:51:19
 NOT BE COMFORTABLE WITH A NONILLUMINATED SIGN

[Captioner] 19:51:22
.
VM

[Captioner] 19:51:26
>> Commissioner Daulton:   OKAY ACCOUNTABLE THANK YOU.
AGAIN I'M GOING

[Captioner] 19:51:29
 TO CLOSE THE MEETING.
I BELIEVE WE HAVE HAD A MOTION AND A

[Captioner] 19:51:32
 ROLL CALL VOTE ON THIS ITEM.
DO WE NEED TO GO ANY FURTHER

[Captioner] 19:51:36
 HERE?
I DON'T THINK SO.

[Captioner] 19:51:39

>> Planner Pullen:   YES.
SO I THINK THE -- WE

[Captioner] 19:51:43
 NEED TO MAKE A DETERMINATION TONIGHT OF SOME

[Captioner] 19:51:46
 KIND.

[Captioner] 19:51:50

AND WHATEVER WE DO --
>> Commissioner Daulton:   I THINK WE 

[Captioner] 19:51:53
DID DENY STAFF RECOMMENDATION WHICH IS A DETERMINATION, IS THAT RIGHT

[Captioner] 19:51:56
?
>> Planner Pullen:   YOU HAVEN'T TAKEN A VOTE ON THAT.


[Captioner] 19:51:59
YOU HAD TWO FAILED VOTES TO APPROVE TWO ITERATION

[Captioner] 19:52:02
S OF THE SIGN, WITH AND

[Captioner] 19:52:05
 WITHOUT ILLUMINATION.
AND SO IF YOU -- I THINK

[Captioner] 19:52:08
 --
>> Commissioner Daulton:   WAIT, CRAIG'S MOTION WAS TO

[Captioner] 19:52:11
 APPROVE STAFF RECOMMENDATION.
>> Commissioner Yee:   RECOMMENDATION EXACTLY.

[Captioner] 19:52:13

>> Commissioner Daulton:   AND IT WAS VOTED DOWN.


[Captioner] 19:52:19
>> Planner Pullen:   CITY ATTORNEY, IF I COULD GET YOUR HELP HERE, WE DON'T HAVE

[Captioner] 19:52:23
 -- WE HAVEN'T ARTICULATED FINDINGS THAT

[Captioner] 19:52:26
 WOULD BE USEFUL FOR THE APPLICANT

[Captioner] 19:52:30
 TO CONSIDER IN THE DENIAL.
CAN YOU WEIGH

[Captioner] 19:52:33
 IN ON WHERE WE'RE AT?
>> YES, I THINK

[Captioner] 19:52:36
 IT WOULD BE PRUDENT, I THINK YOU HAVE TWO FAILED MOTION

[Captioner] 19:52:39
, YOU HAVEN'T TAKEN AFFIRMATIVE ACTION RECOMMENDING

[Captioner] 19:52:42
 DENIAL SO I THINK IF THAT IS THE PLEASURE OF THE COMMISSION IT

[Captioner] 19:52:45
 WOULD BE
APPROPRIATE TO ENTERTAIN THAT MOTION AND ARTICULATE

[Captioner] 19:52:49
 THE BASIS FOR THAT MOTION.
>> Commissioner Daulton: 

[Captioner] 19:52:52
  THANK YOU.
I MOVE TO DENY STAFF

[Captioner] 19:52:55
 RECOMMENDING.
CAN I GET A SECOND?
>> Commissioner Liu:   SECOND

[Captioner] 19:52:59
.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   JOEL CAN YOU GIVE US A ROLL CALL VOTE

[Captioner] 19:53:02
 VOTE?
>> Planner Pullen:   YES, BEFORE WE DO

[Captioner] 19:53:05
 THAT I DO WANT TO RETURN TO THE

[Captioner] 19:53:08
 REPORT BECAUSE I DO WANT TO RESTATE SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN

[Captioner] 19:53:12
 MADE HERE FOR THE PURPOSE OF IDENTIFYING

[Captioner] 19:53:15
 THE COMMISSION'S
OPINIONS AS DRIVING

[Captioner] 19:53:18
 THE MOTION.
SO THERE ARE, IF YOU LOOK AT THE STAFF REPORT

[Captioner] 19:53:22
 THERE ARE FOUR FINDINGS FOR A CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT

[Captioner] 19:53:26
 THAT ARE STATED IN THE STAFF REPORT, WITH STAFF

[Captioner] 19:53:29
'S COMMENTS.
ONE OF THEM IS APPROPRIATENESS

[Captioner] 19:53:32
 WITH THE GENERAL PLAN, ZONING AND

[Captioner] 19:53:36
 ADOPTED DESIGN RULES, ONE IS PHYSICAL SUITABILITY

[Captioner] 19:53:39
 OF THE SITE FOR THE TYPE OF USE.
ONE OF THEM IS THE DESIGN

[Captioner] 19:53:42
 OF THE

[Captioner] 19:53:46
 IMPROVEMENTS, IN THIS CASE THE SIGN.
AND THE LAST ONE IS

[Captioner] 19:53:49
 NOT BEING DETRIMENTAL TO PUBLIC HEALTH, SAFETY OR WELFARE

[Captioner] 19:53:52
.
WHAT I'VE HEARD FROM THE COMMISSION WAS THAT

[Captioner] 19:53:55
, AND I WILL READ THE NOTES I TOOK.
AND YOU CAN TELL

[Captioner] 19:53:59
 ME, THE MAKER OF THE MOTION AND SECONDER, WHETHER

[Captioner] 19:54:02
 THESE ARE WHAT YOU'RE BASING ON OR SOMETHING ELSE.
BUT

[Captioner] 19:54:06
 I HEARD THAT THERE'S ALREADY SUFFICIENT SIGNAGE IN THE FORM

[Captioner] 19:54:09
 OF THE SIGNAGE ON THE BUILDING.
THERE WAS CONCERN ABOUT THIS SETTING

[Captioner] 19:54:12
 A PRECEDENT ALONG THE CORRIDOR.
AND THERE WAS A CONCERN ABOUT

[Captioner] 19:54:24
 THE SPECIFIC LOCATION OF THE SIGN AND ITS SITE NEAR THE FREE BAY.
>> Planner Pullen:  .


[Captioner] 19:54:27
IS THAT ACCURATE?
>> Commissioner Daulton:  

[Captioner] 19:54:30
 I'M GOING TO ADD THAT SPECIFICALLY, THE DESIGN OF THE SIGN

[Captioner] 19:54:33
 AS AN ILLUMINATED SIGN WAS CONSIDERED TO BE IN

[Captioner] 19:54:37
APPROPRIATE.
>> Planner Pullen:   OKAY SO I HAVE THOSE FOUR THINGS AND

[Captioner] 19:54:41
 THOSE DO FIT IN TO THE FINDINGS FOR A CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT

[Captioner] 19:54:45
.
WITH I THINK THE MAKER OF THE MOTION WAS

[Captioner] 19:54:48
 CHAIR DAULTON AND THEN THE SECONDER DOES SECONDER AGREE WITH

[Captioner] 19:54:51
 THOSE FINDINGS?
>> Commissioner Daulton:   WAS

[Captioner] 19:54:55

>> Commissioner Liu:   I SECONDED.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   YOU

[Captioner] 19:54:58
 SECONDED, YES ARE THOSE FINDINGS OKAY WITH

[Captioner] 19:55:02
 YOU COMMISSIONER ZHANG

[Captioner] 19:55:06
 ZHANG?
>> Commissioner Zhang:   YES.
>> Planner Pullen:   THANK YOU FOR 

[Captioner] 19:55:10
BEARING WITH ME WHILE I MAKE SURE OUR RECORD IS CORRECT

[Captioner] 19:55:13
.

>> Commissioner Basrai:   NO.
>> Planner Pullen:   THE VOTE ON THAT 

[Captioner] 19:55:42
ITEM IS 4-3.
THE MOTION PASSES.
THE

[Captioner] 19:55:46
 COMMISSION'S ACTION ON THIS ACTION IS FINAL

[Captioner] 19:55:49
 AS REVIEWED BY THE PLANNING COMMISSION UNLESS IT IS APPEALED TO THE

[Captioner] 19:55:52
 CITY COUNCIL WITHIN TEN DAYS.
BACK TO YOU CHAIR

[Captioner] 19:55:55
.

.
YOU HAVE SOME PRESENTATION.
>> THANK YOU

[Captioner] 19:57:10
 JOEL.
GOOD EVENING AGAIN  COMMISSIONERS.


[Captioner] 19:57:14
THE PROJECT BEFORE IF COMMISSION THIS EVENING IS THE AT&T

[Captioner] 19:57:18
 WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS POLE THORNTON PROJECT.
LOCAT

[Captioner] 19:57:21
ED AT 4771

[Captioner] 19:57:24
 THORNTON AVENUE IN THE CENTERVILLE COMMUNITY PLAN AREA

[Captioner] 19:57:28
.
THE PROPOSED PROJECT

[Captioner] 19:57:31
 WOULD REQUIRE APPROVAL OF A CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT, AND

[Captioner] 19:57:35
 A DISCRETIONARY DESIGN REVIEW.


[Captioner] 19:57:41
THE THE PROJECT SITE IS AN EXISTING

[Captioner] 19:57:44
 SELF STORAGE FACILITY ON THORNTON AFTERNOON

[Captioner] 19:57:47
.
THE PROPERTY IS CONSIDERED GENERAL

[Captioner] 19:57:50
 COMMERCIAL IN THE GENERAL PLAN AND THE PLAN IS

[Captioner] 19:57:54
 GENERAL COMMERCIAL.
A WIRELESS POLE IS LOWFERRED IN THE

[Captioner] 19:57:57
 CD ZONING DISTRICT SUBJECT TO A CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT.
THE PLANNING COMMISSION

[Captioner] 19:58:00
'S CONSIDERATION OF THE PROJECT IS GOVERNED BY BOTH

[Captioner] 19:58:04
 THE CITY GOANG REGULATIONS AND THE FEDERAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS ACT.


[Captioner] 19:58:08
UNDER THE CITY'S REGULATION

[Captioner] 19:58:12
S THE PLAN MUST

[Captioner] 19:58:15
 BE CONSISTENT WITH THE GENERAL PLAN FOR SITE AND COMPLY FOR

[Captioner] 19:58:18
 THE STANDARDS SET FORTH IN FREMONT MIPT

[Captioner] 19:58:22
 CHAPTER 18.187 AND CHAPTER 4

[Captioner] 19:58:25
 OF THE CITYWIDE DESIGN
GUIDELINES.


[Captioner] 19:58:29
THE FEDERAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS ACT LIMITS THE COMMISSION'S CONSIDERATION

[Captioner] 19:58:32
 OF THE PROJECT UNDERTHESE LOCAL STANDARDS

[Captioner] 19:58:35
, AND PROHIBITS THE CITY FROM EITHER CONDITIONING OR

[Captioner] 19:58:39
 DENYING THE PROJECT BASED ON
CONCERNS STEMMING FROM THE

[Captioner] 19:58:42
 ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS OF RADIO FREQUENCY  EMISSIONS IF THE

[Captioner] 19:58:46
 PROPOSED FACILITY COMPLIES WITH FEDERAL STANDARDS.
FURTHERMORE

[Captioner] 19:58:49
, FEDERAL LAW PROHIBITS THE CITY FROM DENYING THE

[Captioner] 19:58:52
 PROJECT, IF THE FACILITY IS NECESSARY TO FILL A

[Captioner] 19:58:56
 SIGNIFICANT SERVICE GAP IN THE APPLICANT'S WIRELESS NETWORK

[Captioner] 19:58:59
, AND THE FACILITY IS THE LEAST

[Captioner] 19:59:02

INTRUSIVE MEANS OF FILLING THE SERVICE GAP

[Captioner] 19:59:06
 GAP.
THE APPLICANT HAS PROVIDED COVERAGE MAPS

[Captioner] 19:59:09
 SHOWING THERE TO BE A

[Captioner] 19:59:13
 GAP IN THIS COVERAGE IN THIS AREA AND THE

[Captioner] 19:59:17
 STEALTH DESIGN IS

[Captioner] 19:59:21
 THE LEAST INTRUSIVE

[Captioner] 19:59:24
 DESIGN CONSIDERING THE FACILITIES IN THE
AREA.

[Captioner] 19:59:27

THE SITE SKITS OF 1.

[Captioner] 19:59:31
83 ACRES OR 73

[Captioner] 19:59:35
,,000 FEET IN THE

[Captioner] 19:59:38
 AREA.
MAIN SELF STORAGE

[Captioner] 19:59:41
 BUILDING AS REQUIRED BY THE FREMONT WIRELESS ORDINANCE THE

[Captioner] 19:59:44
 PROPOSED WIRELESS FACILITY WOULD BE LOCATED AT LEAST 100

[Captioner] 19:59:47
 FEET FROM THE NEAREST RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY LINE.


[Captioner] 19:59:52
 .
THE

[Captioner] 19:59:55
 APPLICANT SELECTED A MONOPINE

[Captioner] 19:59:59
 STEALTH WIRELESS DESIGN DUE TO THE EXISTING PINE TREES ON

[Captioner] 20:00:02
 THE PROJECT SITE AND ACROSS THE STREET.
THESE EXISTING TREES

[Captioner] 20:00:05
 WOULD HELP THE MONOPINE POLE

[Captioner] 20:00:08
 BLEND INTO THE SURROUNDING AREA.
THE PROPOSED POLE WOULD BE

[Captioner] 20:00:11
 70 FEET TALL TO ALLOW THE ANTENNAS

[Captioner] 20:00:15
 TO FILL IN THE COVERAGE GAP WHILE STILL PROVIDING

[Captioner] 20:00:18
 A REALISTIC TREE DESIGN.
WITH BRANCHES EXTEND

[Captioner] 20:00:22
ING ABOVE THE TOPS OF THE ANTENNA

[Captioner] 20:00:25
S, THE HEIGHT OF THE MONOPOLE IS SIMILAR

[Captioner] 20:00:28
 TO THE HEIGHT OF SIMILAR POLES IN FREMONT.
THE

[Captioner] 20:00:31
 GROUND MOUNTED EQUIPMENT WOULD BE LOCATED

[Captioner] 20:00:34
 WITHIN AN  EXISTING SELF STORAGE UNDER AND A THREE

[Captioner] 20:00:38
 FOOT TALL FENCE WOULD SURROUND THE POLE

[Captioner] 20:00:41
 TO CONCEAL THE AIR CONDITIONING CONDENSER

[Captioner] 20:00:44
.
STAFF RECOMMENDS THAT THE PLANNING COMMISSION FIND THE

[Captioner] 20:00:48
 PLAN EXEMPT FROM CEQA FOR THE

[Captioner] 20:00:51
 REASONS ENUMERATED IN THE  REPORT, AND

[Captioner] 20:00:54
 SUBJECT TO CONDITIONS OF APPROVAL CONTAINED IN EXHIBIT B

[Captioner] 20:00:58
.
THANK YOU.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   THANK YOU

[Captioner] 20:01:01
 JAMES.
COMMISSIONERS DO WE HAVE ANY CLARIFYING QUESTIONS FOR

[Captioner] 20:01:04
 STAFF AT THIS TIME?

[Captioner] 20:01:14

COMMISSIONER YEE.
>> Commissioner Yee:   JAMES I

[Captioner] 20:01:17
 SAW THE COVERAGE PAP AND WHERE ARE THE NEAR

[Captioner] 20:01:20
EST AT&T TOWERS FROM THIS PROPOSED SITE

[Captioner] 20:01:24
 DO YOU HAPPEN TO KNOW?
>> THAT WOULD BE A BETTER QUESTION

[Captioner] 20:01:28
 OF THE APPLICANT.
I KNOW OF OTHER FACILITIES

[Captioner] 20:01:31
 AT THE SITE --
>> Commissioner Yee:   I KNOW THERE ARE A FEW

[Captioner] 20:01:34
 TOWERS ACROSS FROM THE CHURCH.
I'M WONDERING IF

[Captioner] 20:01:38
 THAT'S PART OF THE AT&T SYSTEM AS WELL.
>> I DO NOT KNOW WHO

[Captioner] 20:01:41
 THE CARRIERS ARE FOR THOSE

[Captioner] 20:01:44
.
>> Commissioner Yee:   IF THE APPLICANT IS HERE I WILL ASK.

[Captioner] 20:01:48

>> THERE ARE NO OTHER MONOPOLES IN THE AREA BUT I DO

[Captioner] 20:01:51
 NOT KNOW WHO THE CARRIERS ARE ACROSS THE STREET BUT THEY DID

[Captioner] 20:01:54
 PROVIDE MAPS SHOWING THERE TO BE A HOLE IN COVERAGE.
>> Commissioner Yee:   I

[Captioner] 20:01:57
 SAW THAT.
THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 20:02:01

>> Commissioner Daulton:   COMMISSIONER ZHANG

[Captioner] 20:02:04
.
>> Commissioner Zhang:   THANK YOU CHAIR.

[Captioner] 20:02:07

THERE ARE ALREADY TWO PINE TREES ON THE SITE OR VERY CLOSE.


[Captioner] 20:02:10
CAN YOU GIVE ME AN IDEA HOW TALL THOSE TREES ARE

[Captioner] 20:02:14
?

[Captioner] 20:02:19

OR DO YOU KNOW?
>> THE VISUAL SIMULATION THAT THE

[Captioner] 20:02:22
 APPLICANT PROVIDED MADE IT APPEAR THAT THEY ARE APPROXIMATELY THE SAME

[Captioner] 20:02:26
 HEIGHT AS THIS TREE, AS THIS POLE.
BUT I DON'T HAVE THE

[Captioner] 20:02:29
 EXACT HEIGHT OF THE TREES UNFORTUNATELY.


[Captioner] 20:02:35
>> Commissioner Zhang:   OKAY.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   I TAKE

[Captioner] 20:02:39
 IT WE DO HAVE AN APPLICANT TO SPEAK TO THIS ITEM

[Captioner] 20:02:42
?
IS THAT RIGHT?
>> GOOD EVENING, THIS IS TOM JOHNSON.


[Captioner] 20:02:45
CAN YOU ALL HEAR ME?
>> Commissioner Daulton:   YES YOU CAN

[Captioner] 20:02:48
 HEAR YOU.
>> THANK YOU JAMES FOR YOUR PRESENTATION THIS EVENING

[Captioner] 20:02:51
.
YOU LEFT LITTLE FOR ME TO CHAT ABOUT BECAUSE YOU DID A VERY

[Captioner] 20:02:54
 GOOD JOB.
COMMISSIONERS, THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME

[Captioner] 20:02:58
.
THIS IS, AS YOU NOTE, AN AT&T

[Captioner] 20:03:01
 WIRELESS FACILITY THAT WE ARE TRYING TO INSTALL HERE IN THE

[Captioner] 20:03:04
 CITY OF FREMONT.


[Captioner] 20:03:08
THE QUESTION ABOUT EXISTING

[Captioner] 20:03:11
 TOWERS WITHIN THE NEIGHBORING AREA.
WE DO

[Captioner] 20:03:14
, AT&T DOES HAVE

[Captioner] 20:03:17
 SOME -- WE'LL JUST CALL IT

[Captioner] 20:03:20
 UP AND DOWN THORNTON IS PROBABLY THE BEST SCENARIO, AND

[Captioner] 20:03:23
 IT LOOKS TO BE ROUGHLY A MILE AWAY

[Captioner] 20:03:26
 IN EACH DIRECTION. WOULD BE

[Captioner] 20:03:30
 MY GUESS.
BUT I WOULD NEED TO GET EXACT ADDRESS

[Captioner] 20:03:34
ES AND PLOT THEM TO UNDERSTAND THE

[Captioner] 20:03:37
 EXACT DISTANCES FROM THIS LOCATION.

[Captioner] 20:03:40

IN REGARDS TO THE EXISTING CHURCH WHERE THOSE OTHER

[Captioner] 20:03:44
 WIRELESS FACILITIES ARE WHICH IS ACROSS THE STREET FROM THIS FACILITY.


[Captioner] 20:03:48
AT&T IS OBVIOUSLY WE DO NOT HAVE

[Captioner] 20:03:52
 ANY USE AT THAT PROPERTY

[Captioner] 20:03:55
.
THERE IS VERIZON, T-MOBILE AND SPRINT ARE

[Captioner] 20:03:58
 CURRENTLY AT THAT LOCATION.
AT&T IS NOT.


[Captioner] 20:04:03
OTHER THAN THAT, I WOULD --

[Captioner] 20:04:07
 I'M OPEN TO SOME FURTHER QUESTIONS.


[Captioner] 20:04:10
>> Commissioner Daulton:   ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU.
COMMISSIONERS, DO YOU HAVE

[Captioner] 20:04:13
 ANY QUESTIONS FOR THE APPLICANT DIRECTLY?


[Captioner] 20:04:23
SEEING TO HANDS -- I DO HAVE A HAND,

[Captioner] 20:04:26
 COMMISSIONER YEE MIDDLE EAST.
>> Commissioner Yee:   I WANTED TO REITERATE ONE OF THE

[Captioner] 20:04:29
 QUESTIONS THAT COMMISSIONER ZHANG SAID.
THIS IS A

[Captioner] 20:04:33
 70 FOOT TOWER.
TOM HOW DOES THAT

[Captioner] 20:04:36
 COMPARE TO THE PINE TREES THAT ARE EXISTING THERE NOW?
>> YOU KNOW

[Captioner] 20:04:39
, I DON'T HAVE THE SURVEY DATA ON WHAT

[Captioner] 20:04:42
 THOSE EXISTING PINE TREES ARE.
I WOULD HAVE TO GO

[Captioner] 20:04:46
 BACK AND GET AN ASSESSMENT ON WHAT THEY

[Captioner] 20:04:49
 ARE CURRENTLY AT.
MY GUESS IS THEY'RE PROBABLY IN THAT

[Captioner] 20:04:52
 50 TO 60-FOOT RANGE.
BUT I'M NOT POSITIVE

[Captioner] 20:04:56
.
>> Commissioner Yee:   OKAY, THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:05:01
>> Commissioner Daulton:   THANK YOU, COMMISSIONER.
IF THERE'S NO MORE QUESTIONS FOR THE

[Captioner] 20:05:05
 APPLICANT, I'D LIKE TO INVITE PUBLIC COMMENT AT THIS TIME.
TRISH

[Captioner] 20:05:08
 DO WE HAVE ANY SPEAKERS?
>> Trish Cordova:   CHAIR

[Captioner] 20:05:11
 DAULTON LET ME TAKE A QUICK LOOK HERE.
I DO NOT SEE ANY

[Captioner] 20:05:14
 HANDS OF SO WE DO NOT HAVE ANY SPEAKERS.
THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 20:05:17

>> Commissioner Daulton:   ALL RIGHT, AND THEN IF THE APPLICANT HAS NOTHING 

[Captioner] 20:05:20
FURTHER TO ADD, DO YOU, MR. JOHNSON

[Captioner] 20:05:24
?
>> I HAVE NOTHING FURTHER

[Captioner] 20:05:27
 TO ADD UNLESS THERE IS ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMISSION.
>> Commissioner Daulton: 

[Captioner] 20:05:30
  I DON'T SEE ANY HANDS SO THANK YOU FOR THAT.
I'M GOING TO

[Captioner] 20:05:33
 CLOSE THE PUBLIC HEARING NOW AND SEE IF THERE'S

[Captioner] 20:05:37
 ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FOR STAFF FROM

[Captioner] 20:05:40
 THE COMMISSION.
IF NOT I WILL ENTERTAIN A MOTION AS

[Captioner] 20:05:43
 WELL, PLEASE.


[Captioner] 20:05:47
COMMISSIONER YEE, YES.
>> Commissioner Yee:   YES, I JUST WANT TO MAKE A MOTION

[Captioner] 20:08:19
IS REQUIRED PURSUANT
TO CEQA, GUIDELINES PER

[Captioner] 20:08:25
 WITHOUT LIMITATION, 15162 AND/OR 15183, AS THE PROPOSED APPROVAL EXTENSION IS CONSISTENT WITH THE

[Captioner] 20:08:34
 PREVIOUSLY PREPARED GUIDELINES

[Captioner] 20:08:37
, AND TONIGHT JAMES WILLIS

[Captioner] 20:08:40
 AGAIN PLANNER FOR
THIS ITEM, DOESN'T HAVE A PREPARED PRESENTATION BUT

[Captioner] 20:08:43
 IS HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE.
>> Commissioner Daulton:  

[Captioner] 20:08:46
 ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU JOEL.
COMMISSIONERS?
ANY

[Captioner] 20:08:51
 QUESTIONS FOR MR. WILLIS?


[Captioner] 20:08:54
MR. YEE, COMMISSIONER YEE  PLEASE.
>> Commissioner Yee: 

[Captioner] 20:08:57
  THANK  YOU.
YES.
I

[Captioner] 20:09:00
 WAS TRYING TO LOOK FOR THE  EIR, YOU KNOW FOR THIS

[Captioner] 20:09:03
 PARTICULAR PROJECT, WAS DATED FROM FEBRUARY 14th

[Captioner] 20:09:06
 OF 2019.
SO I LOOKED ON OUR SITE, JUST SO YOU

[Captioner] 20:09:10
 KNOW.
FOR SOME REASON IT'S MISSING.
SO

[Captioner] 20:09:13
 MY QUESTION THEN IS, I'M TRYING TO REMEMBER.
HOW MANY OF THE UNITS

[Captioner] 20:09:16
 DID NOT SATISFY THE NOISE REQUIREMENT

[Captioner] 20:09:19
?
I THOUGHT IT WAS LIKE 75, MAYBE SIX OF THEM.


[Captioner] 20:09:32
JAMES YOU'RE ON MUTE

[Captioner] 20:09:35
.
>> Planner Pullen:   JAMES DO YOU KNOW THAT INFORMATION?

[Captioner] 20:09:38

>> NOT OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD.
BUT I COULD CHECK THE

[Captioner] 20:09:41
 MEMO FROM THE PREVIOUS HEARING.
>> Planner Pullen:  

[Captioner] 20:09:44
 YES, COMMISSIONER YEE THERE WAS A MEMO PROVIDED

[Captioner] 20:09:51
 TO ADDRESS THAT SPECIFIC ITEM AND GIVEN THAT I WAS THE

[Captioner] 20:09:54
 ORIGINAL PLANNER OF THE PROJECT IN 2019, WHEN

[Captioner] 20:09:59
 THIS -- LATE IN THE PROJECT
REVIEW WHEN THIS CAME TO COMMISSION

[Captioner] 20:10:02
, THAT MEMO WOULD HAVE THE ANSWER.
IT'S NOT

[Captioner] 20:10:07
 REALLY GERMANE TO THE ACTION BEFORE YOU

[Captioner] 20:10:11
 TONIGHT BECAUSE THERE IS NO PURVIEW THAT THE COMMISSION HAS OVER THE

[Captioner] 20:10:15
 PREVIOUS ENVIRONMENTAL DOCUMENT, PREVIOUS

[Captioner] 20:10:18
 ENVIRONMENTAL DOCUMENT REMAINS
ADOPTED BY CITY COUNCIL

[Captioner] 20:10:22
 AND COULDN'T BE UNDONE OR MODIFIED OR WHATEVER AS

[Captioner] 20:10:26
 PART OF THIS ACTION.
IT'S BEEN CERTIFIED BY

[Captioner] 20:10:29
 THE CITY COUNCIL.
IN TERMS OF JUST PROVIDING THE DATA, WHAT THE

[Captioner] 20:10:32
 SITUATION THERE WAS, WAS THE TRAIN

[Captioner] 20:10:36
 TRACKS THAT ARE IMMEDIATELY NORTH OF THE PROPERTY, THEY

[Captioner] 20:10:39
 HAVE THE VIBRATION FROM THE TRAINS AND THEY HAVE

[Captioner] 20:10:43
 THE
INSTANTANEOUS SOUND OF

[Captioner] 20:10:46
 THEM BLOWING THE HORN.
BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO BLOW

[Captioner] 20:10:49
 THEIR HORN AT THAT INTELLECTS, THAT

[Captioner] 20:10:53
 SOUND OCCURS UP AND DOWN THE ROADWAY, AND

[Captioner] 20:10:56
 THE HOUSES HAVE MUCH POORER SOUND

[Captioner] 20:11:00
 INSULATION THAN THIS DEVELOPMENT WOULD HAVE HAD.
CAN'T

[Captioner] 20:11:03
 FEASIBLY MITIGATE THAT TRAIN-HORN NOISE.
YOU

[Captioner] 20:11:06
 CAN'T MAKE IT GO AWAY FOR THE INSTANTANEOUS

[Captioner] 20:11:09
 SOUND.
HOWEVER, OVER A 24 HOUR PERIOD THE

[Captioner] 20:11:12
 PROJECT COMPLIED FOR OUR NOISE STANDARDS.
THAT IS ONE

[Captioner] 20:11:16
 OF THE REASONS WE DID THE ENVIRONMENT AND HAD THAT RULE

[Captioner] 20:11:19
 JUST TO BRING EVERYBODY UP TO SPEED ON THAT ISSUE.

[Captioner] 20:11:21

>> Commissioner Yee:   YES, I MEAN I DO REMEMBER ALL OF THAT.


[Captioner] 20:11:25
I WAS JUST TRYING TO REMEMBER HOW MANY OF THE UNITS

[Captioner] 20:11:28
 DIDN'T QUITE MEET IT.
BECAUSE WHEN THAT TRAIN WHISTLE OR

[Captioner] 20:11:31
 HORN WOULD SOUND IT WOULD EXCEED THAT NOISE REQUIREMENT

[Captioner] 20:11:35
.
I GUESS, YOU KNOW, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

[Captioner] 20:11:38
, YOU KNOW, EXTENDING THIS PERMIT.
AND YOU

[Captioner] 20:11:41
 KIND OF ALMOST ALLUDED TO, BUT

[Captioner] 20:11:45
 I GUESS ONE THING THAT I WAS LOOKING AT TO MAYBE MAKE IT

[Captioner] 20:11:48
 A LITTLE BIT EASIER FOR DEVELOPER BECAUSE I KNOW THAT IN EXHIBIT

[Captioner] 20:11:51
 A, IN

[Captioner] 20:11:54
 SECTION B-3 UNDER D, IT TALKS
ABOUT

[Captioner] 20:11:58
 WORK WITH TRADE UNIONS AND HIRE LOCALLY FOR

[Captioner] 20:12:01
 CONSTRUCTION OF THE PROJECT.
I'M JUST WONDERING TO MAKE

[Captioner] 20:12:05
 IT MAYBE A LITTLE BIT EASIER FOR THE DEVELOPER TO BE

[Captioner] 20:12:09
 ABLE TO PREFERENCE TO HIRE FROM THE LOCAL FREMONT BUSINESSES

[Captioner] 20:12:12
, AND IF THEY WANT TO WORK WITH THE

[Captioner] 20:12:15
 TRADE UNIONS, THAT THE
TRADE UNIONS HAVE TO SHOW THAT THEY HAVE AT

[Captioner] 20:12:19
 LEAST 50% PLUS ONE ARE

[Captioner] 20:12:22
 FREMONT RESIDENTS WORKING ON THIS PROJECT.
WOULD IT

[Captioner] 20:12:25
 BE POSSIBLE TO MAKE A CHANGE TO THAT ONE LINE ITEM THAT IS

[Captioner] 20:12:28
 IN THERE IN EXHIBIT A THAT WAS ORIGINALLY PASSED

[Captioner] 20:12:33
?
>> Planner Pullen:   THE CITY ATTORNEY MAY

[Captioner] 20:12:36
 BE ABLE TO PROVIDE MORE BACKGROUND ON THIS

[Captioner] 20:12:40
.
BUT THAT CONDITION --
>> Commissioner Yee:   THE REASON I'M 

[Captioner] 20:12:43
JUST ASKING IS BECAUSE WITH THE WAY THE HOUSING ENVIRONMENT IS RIGHT NOW

[Captioner] 20:12:46
 I'M TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR

[Captioner] 20:12:49
 THE DEVELOPER TO BE ABLE TO BUILD THE
AFFORDABLE PIECE

[Captioner] 20:12:53
 THAT WE NEED FOR THIS PROJECT.

[Captioner] 20:12:54

>> Planner Pullen:   I HEAR YOU COMMISSIONER.


[Captioner] 20:12:59
SO THAT CONDITION SPECIFICALLY WAS ADDED AT

[Captioner] 20:13:02
 THE COUNCIL  MEETING, BASED ON SOME PEOPLE WHO SHOWED

[Captioner] 20:13:05
 UP BACK IN MARCH, 2019.
AND IT WAS

[Captioner] 20:13:09
 TO WORK WITH THEM TO SEE IF THEY

[Captioner] 20:13:12
 CAN COME TO AN ARRANGEMENT ON THE USE

[Captioner] 20:13:15
 OF LABOR.
THAT CAN'T

[Captioner] 20:13:18
 BE ENFORCED IN A DIFFERENT WAY, OR

[Captioner] 20:13:22
 IN ANY SPECIFIC WAY BY

[Captioner] 20:13:25
 THE PLANNING COMMISSION TONIGHT BECAUSE THAT TOPIC IS NOT UP

[Captioner] 20:13:28
 FOR YOUR REVIEW AS A SEPARATE

[Captioner] 20:13:32
 ITEM.
SO HEATHER, CAN YOU CLARIFY IF THAT'S

[Captioner] 20:13:34
 CORRECT OR IF I'M  MITTSING SOMETHING?
>> 

[Captioner] 20:13:38
NO, I THINK THAT'S CORRECT.
THAT ITEM'S

[Captioner] 20:13:41
 NOT PART OF THE NOTICED ACTION.
SO IF THAT'S SOMETHING THAT

[Captioner] 20:13:44
 WOULD WANT -- YOU KNOW THE APPLICANT WOULD SEEK TO HAVE CONSIDERED

[Captioner] 20:13:48
 DOWN THE ROAD I THINK THAT COULD BE BROUGHT BACK BUT IT'S NOT

[Captioner] 20:13:50
 -- AMENDING THAT CONDITION IS NOT BEFORE
THE COMMISSION TONIGHT.


[Captioner] 20:13:59
>> Commissioner Yee:   OKAY, I'M JUST TRYING TO MAKE SURE TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR

[Captioner] 20:14:02
 THE DEVELOPER TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN.
BECAUSE AS YOU'VE SEEN

[Captioner] 20:14:05
 IN THE PAST WITH, YOU KNOW, AND JUST LIKE RIGHT NOW THIS IS

[Captioner] 20:14:09
 A FORMER

[Captioner] 20:14:12
 SILICON SAGE PROJECT AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE OUR

[Captioner] 20:14:15
 PROJECTS GO THROUGH.
WE'VE SEEN -- WE'VE GIVEN THE

[Captioner] 20:14:18
 GREEN LIGHT TO SOME OF THESE PROJECTS AND THEY DON'T COME THROUGH

[Captioner] 20:14:21
 TO FRUITION.
SO I'M TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

[Captioner] 20:14:24
 GET IT TO THE TROOUTION.


[Captioner] 20:14:33
 TO FRUITION.
>> Planner Pullen:  

[Captioner] 20:14:37
 JUST THIS PROJECT IS VERY UNIQUE

[Captioner] 20:14:41
 TO THE SILICON SAGE ENTITY.

[Captioner] 20:14:45

THERE WERE SOME CHARGES BROUGHT BY GOVERNMENT AGENCIES

[Captioner] 20:14:48
 RELATED TO THE ENTITIES THAT BROUGHT THIS FORWARD THE FIRST TIME

[Captioner] 20:14:51
 AND THIS IN ADDITION TO ANOTHER PROPERTY IN TREATMENT WERE TIED UP

[Captioner] 20:14:55
 BY RECEIVERSHIP
 AND SO THE APPLICANT THAT'S BEFORE YOU

[Captioner] 20:14:58
 TONIGHT VERY RECENTLY

[Captioner] 20:15:01
 FORECLOSED ON THE PROPERTY JUST IN TIME TO GET

[Captioner] 20:15:04
 THIS EXTENSION IN, IN ORDER TO

[Captioner] 20:15:08
 PRESERVE THEIR RIGHTS TO PURSUE WITH

[Captioner] 20:15:11
 THE PROJECT IF THEY'RE
ABLE TO.
AND

[Captioner] 20:15:14
 SO, YOU KNOW, THAT'S -- IT'S NOT EVERY DAY

[Captioner] 20:15:18
 THIS HAPPENS, IT'S NOT JUST A MATTER OF THE PROJECT SITTING

[Captioner] 20:15:21
 AND THE APPLICANT NOT MOVING FORWARD ON IT.
IT'S A RECEIVER

[Captioner] 20:15:24
 WHO DOESN'T HAVE THE POWER TO DO ANYTHING

[Captioner] 20:15:28
 OUTSIDE OF WHAT THE COURT ALLOWS AND THAT'S WHAT WE'VE

[Captioner] 20:15:31
 BEEN DEALING WITH FOR THE LAST TWO AND A  HALF, THREE YEARS.


[Captioner] 20:15:34
SO NOW WE'VE GOT AN OWNER WHO STATES THEY HAVE

[Captioner] 20:15:37
 THE WHEREWITHAL TO BRING THIS FORWARD OR TO

[Captioner] 20:15:41
 DO SOMETHING ELSE IN THE FUTURE AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE'RE

[Captioner] 20:15:44
 TRYING TO PRESERVE.
IN THE MEANTIME IT'S

[Captioner] 20:15:47
 A CHALLENGE FOR THE CITY.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   I

[Captioner] 20:15:50
 SEE MR. 

[Captioner] 20:15:53
KEVLIN HAS HIS HAND UP HERE.
IS

[Captioner] 20:15:56
 HE ASSOCIATED WITH THE APPLICANT

[Captioner] 20:16:00
?
>> Planner Pullen:   YES.
IT MIGHT BE APPROPRIATE TO GO TO

[Captioner] 20:16:03
 THE APPLICANT PRESENTATION.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   OKAY, LET'S HEAR FROM THE

[Captioner] 20:16:07
 APPLICANT THEN.
YES, MR. KEVLIN.

[Captioner] 20:16:10

>> THANK YOU CHAIRPERSON  DAULTON.
AND GOOD EVENING COMMISSIONERS

[Captioner] 20:16:13
, I'M JOHN KEVLIN, WITH THE

[Captioner] 20:16:16
 LAW FIRM OF RUBIN J

[Captioner] 20:16:19
UNIS AND ROSE.
I'M

[Captioner] 20:16:23
 HERE FOR THE PROJECT

[Captioner] 20:16:26
, CENTERVILLE MIXED USE  ENTITLEMENTS WHICH

[Captioner] 20:16:29
 WERE GRANTED BY THE CITY IN 2019 AND

[Captioner] 20:16:33
 AUTHORIZED ON THIS FOUR PLUS ACRE

[Captioner] 20:16:36
 SITE.
ASSOCIATES HAVE BEEN WORKING

[Captioner] 20:16:40
 DILIGENTLY TO MOVE IT FORWARD SINCE THE PROJECT

[Captioner] 20:16:44
 SPONSOR WENT INTO BANKRUPTCY.

[Captioner] 20:16:47

THE ENTITLEMENTS

[Captioner] 20:16:50
 WENT IN 2022,

[Captioner] 20:16:53
 DESPITE THESE EFFORTS THEY ONLY WERE ABLE TO

[Captioner] 20:16:56
 OBTAIN TITLE TO THE PROPERTY IN

[Captioner] 20:16:59
 2022.
NOT MUCH TIME PASSED BETWEEN THEN AND WHEN THE

[Captioner] 20:17:03
 ENTITLEMENTS EXPIRED.
SINCE THEN THEY HIRED A

[Captioner] 20:17:06
 PROMINENT

[Captioner] 20:17:09
 CONSTRUCTION FIRM BDE, AS WELL AS MYSELF, LAND USE ATTORNEY

[Captioner] 20:17:13
 AND WE'RE ALL WORKING DILIGENTLY TOWARDS LOOK

[Captioner] 20:17:16
ING TO THESE CURRENT ENTITLEMENTS AND

[Captioner] 20:17:19
 WORKING TOWARDS THE
DEVELOPMENT OF THE SITE.
OBVIOUSLY THIS

[Captioner] 20:17:22
 FALL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS DETERIORATED

[Captioner] 20:17:25
 ESPECIALLY IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS, AND THE ABILITY TO

[Captioner] 20:17:29
 FINANCE A DEVELOPMENT IS MORE CHALLENGING, SO

[Captioner] 20:17:32
 WE'RE HERE TONIGHT LOOKING FOR THE TWO YEAR
EXTENSION ALLOWING US

[Captioner] 20:17:35
 TO WORK ON THE ENTITLEMENT AND THE DEVELOPMENT AND POSITION THE DEVELOPMENT TO BE

[Captioner] 20:17:38
 ABLE TO BREAK GROUND IN THE YEARS TO COME.


[Captioner] 20:17:42
SAHIL GANDHI IS

[Captioner] 20:17:45
 HERE I'M HERE AS WELL AS OUR PLANNING CONSULTANT IN CASE YOU HAVE

[Captioner] 20:17:49
 QUESTIONS.
COMMISSIONER YEE I APPRECIATE YOUR ATTENTIVE

[Captioner] 20:17:52
NESS TOWARDS MAKING THIS

[Captioner] 20:17:55
 PROJECT WORK, OUR TEAM IS FOCUSING OFTEN PRETTY

[Captioner] 20:17:58
 CLOSELY AT THE MOMENT AND WE PLAN TO

[Captioner] 20:18:02
 HAVE DISCUSSIONS WITH CITY STAFF HERE IN THE

[Captioner] 20:18:05

NEAR FUTURE BUT TO KEEP THIS PROJECT GOING NEED

[Captioner] 20:18:08
 THAT ENTITLEMENT EXTENSION SO WE STILL HAVE THE PROJECT

[Captioner] 20:18:11
 TO BE WORKING WITH.
LIKE I SAID I'M HERE WITH ANY QUESTIONS.


[Captioner] 20:18:14
WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THAT YOU ALL SUPPORT THE EXTENSION.


[Captioner] 20:18:18
>> Commissioner Daulton:   THANK YOU SIR.
COMMISSIONERS, DO YOU HAVE ANY

[Captioner] 20:18:21
 QUESTIONS FOR THE APPLICANT?
COMMISSIONER YEE

[Captioner] 20:18:26
.
>> Commissioner Yee:   YES.
SO MR. KE

[Captioner] 20:18:29
VLIN IF WE GRANTth YOU THIS

[Captioner] 20:18:32
 EXTENSION, WHEN DO YOU PLAN OR WHEN DO YOU FORESEE

[Captioner] 20:18:35
 YOU ACTUALLY COULD BREAK GROUND TO

[Captioner] 20:18:38
 START THE PROJECT ?
S

[Captioner] 20:18:41
AHIL DO YOU WANT TO TAKE THAT ONE

[Captioner] 20:18:51

>> SAHIL DO YOU WANT TO STAY THAT ONE?


[Captioner] 20:18:54
BEFORE SAHIL TAKES THAT,

[Captioner] 20:18:57
 THE WORLD HAS CHANGED QUITE A BIT, LAND

[Captioner] 20:19:01
 USE POLICY HAS CHANGED QUITE A

[Captioner] 20:19:04
BIT.
WE ARE LOOKING AND MAKING SURE THIS

[Captioner] 20:19:07
 IS THE TYPE OF PROJECT TO COME OUT OF THE GROUND AS

[Captioner] 20:19:10
 UPON.
THAT IS THE POSITION FROM

[Captioner] 20:19:13
 A ZONING PERSPECTIVE AND SAHIL YOU

[Captioner] 20:19:17
 MAY BE ABLE TO SPEAK A LITTLE BIT BETTER TO FINANCING AND

[Captioner] 20:19:20
 THOSE SORTS OF THINGS FOR COMMISSIONER YEE.
>> EXACTLY

[Captioner] 20:19:23
.
I DON'T HAVE ANT EXACT ANSWER I CAN

[Captioner] 20:19:26
 PROVIDE BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF

[Captioner] 20:19:29
 DIFFERENT MOVING PARTS, LIKE JOHN HAS MENTION

[Captioner] 20:19:33
ED, THERE'S FINANCING

[Captioner] 20:19:37
, CERTAINLY BE ONE OF THEM.
BUT THE GOAL WOULD BE

[Captioner] 20:19:41
 TO, YOU KNOW, TO

[Captioner] 20:19:45
 MOVE IT AS

[Captioner] 20:19:48
 QUICK A PACE AS POSSIBLE.
>> AND COMMISSIONER, THE

[Captioner] 20:19:51
 FACT THAT WE'VE GOT THIS TEAM INVOLVED WE ARE READY TO

[Captioner] 20:19:55
 COME IN AND START WORKING WITH STAFF AGAIN, YOU KNOW, PRETTY

[Captioner] 20:19:58
 SHORTLY AFTER WE MOVE THROUGH THIS EXTENSION PROCESS

[Captioner] 20:20:01
.
SO WE ARE -- WE HAVE A TEAM

[Captioner] 20:20:04
 INVOLVED MOVING THIS FORWARD AS QUICKLY AND AS PRODUCTIVELY

[Captioner] 20:20:08
 AS WE CAN.
>> Commissioner Yee:   I APPRECIATE THAT BUT IT WOULD BE

[Captioner] 20:20:11
 NICE TO KNOW ROUGHLY KIND OF A TIME LINE.

[Captioner] 20:20:14

BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, WE ALREADY GOT BURNED ONCE

[Captioner] 20:20:17
.
YOU KNOW, WITH THE PREVIOUS.


[Captioner] 20:20:20
AND I DON'T WANT TO MENTION THE NAME BECAUSE IT'S ALREADY BEEN MENTION

[Captioner] 20:20:24
ED SEVERAL TIMES.
BUT, YOU KNOW, I JUST WANT TO

[Captioner] 20:20:27
 MAKE SURE TO PROTECT OUR CITY SO THAT WHEN WE DO GIVE THE

[Captioner] 20:20:30
 GREEN LIGHT TO BUILD, THAT IT

[Captioner] 20:20:33
 ACTUALLY COMES TO FRUITION AND TRY TO FIND WAYS TO

[Captioner] 20:20:37
 MAKE SURE THAT IT DOES HAPPEN.
ESPECIALLY, THIS IS

[Captioner] 20:20:40
 AN IMPORTANT PROJECT, TO ENSURE THE LIVELIHOOD AND REINVIGORATE

[Captioner] 20:20:44
 THAT CENTERVILLE DISTRICT AND ESPECIALLY WITH ALL THE

[Captioner] 20:20:47
 AFFORDABLE HOUSING PIECES THAT ARE INCLUDED INTO THIS PROJECT

[Captioner] 20:20:50
.
WHICH IS SO MUCH IN DEMAND RIGHT NOW FOR US AS A

[Captioner] 20:20:53
 CITY.
AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT

[Captioner] 20:20:57
 ACTUALLY HAPPENS.
BUT THAT'S WHY I WAS JUST TRYING

[Captioner] 20:21:00
 TO FIGURE OUT ROUGHLY KIND OF A TIME LINE.
BECAUSE YOU

[Captioner] 20:21:03
 WANTED A TWO YEAR EXTENSION AND MY CONCERN IS I GIVE YOU

[Captioner] 20:21:06
 A TWO YEAR EXTENSION, TWO YEARS DOWN THE ROAD FROM

[Captioner] 20:21:09
  NOW, ALSO CAN WE HAVE A TWO YEAR EXTENSION?
I'D

[Captioner] 20:21:12
 LIKE TO SEE THIS GET DONE, NOT JUST SITTING THERE

[Captioner] 20:21:15
 AND WE'VE GOT AN OVER FOUR ACRE PIECE OF DIRT

[Captioner] 20:21:19
 JUST COLLECTING RAIN RIGHT NOW.

[Captioner] 20:21:22

>> AND COMMISSIONER I CAN'T SPEAK TO THE PREVIOUS DEVELOPER, I

[Captioner] 20:21:25
 DON'T KNOW THEM, OBVIOUSLY I'VE HEARD

[Captioner] 20:21:28
 THE HISTORY, BUT  BELOU

[Captioner] 20:21:31
R ASSOCIATES, THEY ARE A VERY PROMINENT DEVELOPER

[Captioner] 20:21:35
 IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.
THIS THE NO, SIR A MERE PAPER INVESTMENT.


[Captioner] 20:21:38
THEY HAVE A LOT OF EXPERIENCE OF GETTING HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS OUT

[Captioner] 20:21:41
 OF THE GROUND AND CERTAINLY THE KIND OF WORK WE ARE DOING RIGHT NOW IS

[Captioner] 20:21:44
 VERY FOCUSED ON THAT EXACT ISSUE.

[Captioner] 20:21:48

YOU KNOW, TINKERING WITH THIS DEVELOPMENT

[Captioner] 20:21:51
 THE WAY WE NEED TO, TO MAKE IT WORK TO MOVE

[Captioner] 20:21:55
 IT TOWARDS CONSTRUCTION AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.

[Captioner] 20:21:59

WE'VE EXPERIENCED DILIGENCE SINCE WE PURCHASED

[Captioner] 20:22:02
 THE PROPERTY IN JULY AND YOU'LL SEE THAT CONTINUE.
>> Commissioner Yee:   ALL  RIGHT, 

[Captioner] 20:22:05
THANK YOU.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   COMMISSIONER ZHANG,

[Captioner] 20:22:09
 PLEASE.

[Captioner] 20:22:10

>> Commissioner Zhang:   THANK YOU CHAIR.


[Captioner] 20:22:13
THE CHAIR HAS BEEN DOWN FOR ALMOST TWO YEARS

[Captioner] 20:22:16
, I PASS THAT SITE OFTEN AND CURRENTLY THERE ARE FANS

[Captioner] 20:22:19
S WITH CROSS LINK EBS FENCES

[Captioner] 20:22:23
 WITH KIND OF VISIBILITY TO EVERYWHERE OF THIS SITE.
WONDER WHETHER YOU

[Captioner] 20:22:27
 CAN HELP LIKE CREATE A MORE

[Captioner] 20:22:32
 PERMANENT FENCE ESPECIALLY ALONG THE FREMONT BOULEVARD TO MAKE IT

[Captioner] 20:22:35
 A LITTLE BIT LESS VISIBLE?
BECAUSE

[Captioner] 20:22:40
 THE

[Captioner] 20:22:45
 OVER GROUND EXPOSED TO WHENEVER I DRIVE

[Captioner] 20:22:48
 BY.
>> CERTAINLY, WE CAN TAKE THAT

[Captioner] 20:22:51
 COMMENT INTO CONSIDERATION AND  SAHIL

[Captioner] 20:22:54
, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO FOLLOW ARE UP ON THAT JUST BEING CLOSER

[Captioner] 20:22:57
 TO WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THE SITE AT THE MOMENT.

[Captioner] 20:23:01

>> 

[Captioner] 20:23:04

>> Commissioner Zhang:   I WONDER IF WE CAN MAKE THAT A CONDITION IF WE

[Captioner] 20:23:07
 APPROVE THIS?
>> Commissioner Daulton:   I SUSPECT WE DON'T HAVE TO MAKE THAT A

[Captioner] 20:23:10
 CONDITION BUT WE CAN DEFINITELY REQUEST THAT OF

[Captioner] 20:23:14
 THE LAND OWNER.
I THINK I WOULD AGREE THAT WE

[Captioner] 20:23:17
 NEED TO RESOLVE

[Captioner] 20:23:20
 THE BLIGHTED LOOK OF THE PROPERTY AS IT

[Captioner] 20:23:23
 STANDS RIGHT NOW.
IT'S -- EVEN

[Captioner] 20:23:26
 THE -- EVEN THE LINK FENCE IS

[Captioner] 20:23:29
 IN A STATE OF  DISREPAIR

[Captioner] 20:23:32
 ESPECIALLY ON PARISH ROAD, I THINK

[Captioner] 20:23:37
.
>> Commissioner Zhang:   AGREE.
>> Commissioner Daulton:  

[Captioner] 20:23:40
 ANY OTHER QUESTIONS?
I HAVE A QUESTION FOR STAFF, BECAUSE

[Captioner] 20:23:43
 I KNOW THAT

[Captioner] 20:23:46
, WELL,  LOOKING AT THE PROJECT SIGNALS ON

[Captioner] 20:23:49
 PAGE 3 OF THE STAFF REPORT, I

[Captioner] 20:23:53
 SEE I NEED SOME KIND OF UNDERSTANDING

[Captioner] 20:23:57
 OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE

[Captioner] 20:24:00
 NOISE
ISSUE ON THIS SITE AND STATE LAW FOR

[Captioner] 20:24:03
 BUILDING CODES.

[Captioner] 20:24:07

INTERIOR NOISE.
BECAUSE IF WE ARE MAKING

[Captioner] 20:24:11
 A DETERMINATION

[Captioner] 20:24:14
 THAT WE ARE GOING TO SUPERSEDE

[Captioner] 20:24:17
 CALIFORNIA LAW HERE THEN IT LOOKS LIKE WE'VE

[Captioner] 20:24:20
 SATISFIED BOTH OF THOSE REASONS

[Captioner] 20:24:24
 TO DENY THIS EXTENSION.
AS FAR AS I KNOW CALIFORNIA

[Captioner] 20:24:27
 LAW SAYS INTERIOR NOISE LEVELS CAN'T

[Captioner] 20:24:30
 EXCEED 45 DECIBELS.
SO THAT'S THE

[Captioner] 20:24:34
 CALIFORNIA BUILDING CODE I'M LOOKING AT RIGHT NOW.
AND THIS

[Captioner] 20:24:37
 PROJECT MINIMUM COMES IN AT 50 DECIBELS BY THE

[Captioner] 20:24:40
 TRAIN TRACK, ISN'T THAT CORRECT?


[Captioner] 20:24:43
AND AS FAR AS I RECALL, IF I RECALL CORRECTLY,

[Captioner] 20:24:46
 BECAUSE I WAS AT ALL THE MEETINGS FOR THIS PROJECT

[Captioner] 20:24:49
 AT CITY COUNCIL WHEN IT WAS A LIVE MEETING,

[Captioner] 20:24:53
 CITY COUNCIL APPROVED AN EVEN HIGHER DECIBEL

[Captioner] 20:24:56
 USE RANGE FOR
THIS PROJECT AT THE TRAIN TRACK

[Captioner] 20:25:01
 UNITS UP TO 65 DISBELLS, I THINK

[Captioner] 20:25:04
 DECIBELS, I THINK

[Captioner] 20:25:07
.
SO I JUST WANT TO RECONCILE, YOU KNOW, MY VOTE HERE

[Captioner] 20:25:10
 WITH CALIFORNIA LAW

[Captioner] 20:25:13
 AND THE CONDITIONS OF APPROVAL OR DENIAL OF THIS

[Captioner] 20:25:16
 PROJECT.

[Captioner] 20:25:20

>> SO THE ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW IS NOT WHAT'S BEFORE THE COMMISSION

[Captioner] 20:25:23
 RIGHT NOW.
THE ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW WAS ALREADY DONE

[Captioner] 20:25:26
 THROUGH THE CEQA PROCESS FOR ORIGINAL ENTITLEMENT AND

[Captioner] 20:25:30
 THAT WAS THE RESULT OF -- RESULTED

[Captioner] 20:25:33
 IN THE EIR.
FOR THE ACTUAL CONSTRUCTION OF THE UNITS

[Captioner] 20:25:36
, THEY WILL NEED TO CONFORM TO BUILDING

[Captioner] 20:25:39
 CODE STANDARDS AND TO WHATEVER

[Captioner] 20:25:43
 STANDARDS WERE CONTAINED IN THE EIR,

[Captioner] 20:25:46
 WHICH THOSE NOISE STUDIES WILL BE DONE DURING

[Captioner] 20:25:49
 THE
CONSTRUCTION DOCUMENT PHASE

[Captioner] 20:25:52
 TO HIGHLIGHT THAT WINDOWS AND

[Captioner] 20:25:56
 INSULATION WILL BE CERTIFIED TO MEET THOSE

[Captioner] 20:25:59
 NOISE STANDARDS THROUGH STC RATINGS,

[Captioner] 20:26:03
 SOUND TRANSITION CO-OFFICIANT

[Captioner] 20:26:11
 COEFFICIENT RATINGS, HAS

[Captioner] 20:26:14

TO MEET ALL THOSE STANDARDS, VOTE ONE WAY OR THE OTHER

[Captioner] 20:26:15
.
SORRY?
>> Commissioner Daulton:   MY 

[Captioner] 20:26:18
UNDERSTANDING IS CITY COUNCIL HAD MADE AN ALLOWANCE FOR

[Captioner] 20:26:22
 THIS PROJECT TO EXCEED THE GENERAL PLAN LIMITATION ON

[Captioner] 20:26:25
 NIGHT TIME DECIBELS BECAUSE OF THE TRAIN

[Captioner] 20:26:28
 HORNS.
AND THAT SEEMS TO BE IN THE DOCUMENTATION

[Captioner] 20:26:31
 THAT YOU PROVIDED US.
AND

[Captioner] 20:26:35
 SO AM I --

[Captioner] 20:26:39
 AM I INTERFERING WITH STATE LAW BY APPROVING

[Captioner] 20:26:42
 THIS PROJECT?
WHAT I WANT TO HEAR IS THAT NO

[Captioner] 20:26:46
, COMMISSIONER DAULTON, YOU'RE

[Captioner] 20:26:50
  NOT, IS THAT RIGHT?
>> Planner Pullen:   NO

[Captioner] 20:26:54
, COMMISSIONER DAULTON, YOU'RE  NOT.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   THAT'S WHAT I WANTED

[Captioner] 20:26:57
 TO HEAR.
>> Planner Pullen:   BUT LET ME TRY TO GIVE AN ANSWER

[Captioner] 20:27:00
 WITHOUT BEING TOO OPAQUE

[Captioner] 20:27:03
.
IT'S -- SO THERE IS A GENERAL PLAN CONSISTENT

[Captioner] 20:27:07
CY DETERMINATION HERE, THAT WAS MADE BY COUNCIL WHEN

[Captioner] 20:27:11
 THEY APPROVED THE PROJECT THAT REMAINS A DECISION THAT THEY MADE AND

[Captioner] 20:27:14
 WE CAN'T CHANGE THAT.

[Captioner] 20:27:24

THERE WAS A DETERMINATION THAT THE

[Captioner] 20:27:29
 INSTANTANEOUS NOISE CAN'T BE RESOLVED

[Captioner] 20:27:32
.
HOWEVER AMBIENT NOISE IS MET FOR THE

[Captioner] 20:27:36
 OUTSIDE ENVIRONMENT,

[Captioner] 20:27:40
 SOUND COEFFICIENT FINDINGS

[Captioner] 20:27:44
, THEY HAVE TO SHOW THAT THEY HAVE DON'T THAT EFFICIENTLY

[Captioner] 20:27:47
.
THEY HAVEN'T DESIGNED A BUILDING YET, WE WILL GET

[Captioner] 20:27:51
 TO PLAN OF THE BUILDING AND WE'LL GET TO MAKE SURE

[Captioner] 20:27:54
 THEY MEET THAT STANDARD.
BUT THEY CAN'T AND THEY DON'T HAVE

[Captioner] 20:27:57
 TO MEET THE STANDARD THAT YOU CAN'T HEAR A

[Captioner] 20:28:01
 TRAIN INSTANTANEOUS

[Captioner] 20:28:04
LY THROUGH THE TRAIN, THAT'S NOT THE TEST.
>> Commissioner Daulton: 

[Captioner] 20:28:07
  I DO UNDERSTAND THAT, I JUST KNOW THE EXPERIENCE OF THE

[Captioner] 20:28:10
 PEOPLE WHO LIVE NEAR ME WHO HAVE

[Captioner] 20:28:15
 SPENT

[Captioner] 20:28:23
 YOU KNOW, MY EXPERIENCE WITH

[Captioner] 20:28:26
 THESE KINDS OF ISSUES THAT HAPPEN IS

[Captioner] 20:28:30
 THAT

[Captioner] 20:28:35
 THE
PEOPLE WHO HAVE PROBLEM WITH THE PROJECT GO BACK AND LOOK AT

[Captioner] 20:28:39
 WHO APPROVED THE PROJECT TO BLAME.
AND SO IF THERE IS

[Captioner] 20:28:42
 GOING TO BE A SUPERSEDING

[Captioner] 20:28:45
 STATE LAW ON THE DECIBEL LEVEL MANY THEN

[Captioner] 20:28:48
 I JUST WANT TO KNOW THAT I'M

[Captioner] 20:28:52
 NOT

[Captioner] 20:28:55
 -- THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO DO THAT,

[Captioner] 20:28:58
 LET'S PUT IT THAT WAY.
>> Planner Pullen:   THAT DECISION

[Captioner] 20:29:02
 WAS PREVIOUSLY MADE.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   OKAY, ALL RIGHT

[Captioner] 20:29:06
.
ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS, COMMISSIONERS

[Captioner] 20:29:09
?
ALL RIGHT, THEN MAY I HAVE A MOTION

[Captioner] 20:29:14
?
>> Planner Pullen:   WE HAVEN'T

[Captioner] 20:29:17
 HEARD NOW -- I'M GOING TO STEP IN

[Captioner] 20:29:20
, PUBLIC COMMENT, MAKE SURE WE HEAR FROM THE PUBLIC

[Captioner] 20:29:23
 AND THEN THE APPLICANT HAS A CHANCE TO REBUT.

[Captioner] 20:29:27

>> Commissioner Daulton:   TRISH DO WE HAVE PUBLIC COMMENT?


[Captioner] 20:29:30
>> Trish Cordova:   YES WE DO, WE HAVE ONE SPEAKER,

[Captioner] 20:29:33
 I'LL GO AHEAD AND INTRODUCE THE SPEAKER.
KELLY

[Captioner] 20:29:38
 I'M ALLOWING YOU TO SPEAK ONE MOMENT.
LET'S SEE HERE.


[Captioner] 20:29:44
>> ALL RIGHT.
>> Trish Cordova:   I DID AND IT'S NOT

[Captioner] 20:29:47
 -- YES, KELLY.

[Captioner] 20:29:50

HE'S HERE NOW.
>> I THINK I'M ALREADY

[Captioner] 20:29:53
 --
>> Trish Cordova:   THANK YOU.
>> YEAH, WE NEVER HAVE TO

[Captioner] 20:29:56
 THANK THE CITY STAFF, THE CITY COUNCIL AND THE

[Captioner] 20:30:00
 CITY PLANNING  COMMISSION, FOR ALL THAT THEY'VE DONE

[Captioner] 20:30:04
 HERE TO REALLY ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD

[Captioner] 20:30:07
.
YOU KNOW, THIS -- IT'S KIND OF

[Captioner] 20:30:10
 LIKE YOU KNOW YOU HAVE DEAD STORES IN A MALL

[Captioner] 20:30:13
 AND WHAT DO YOU DO YOU PUT UP WINDOW DRESSINGS

[Captioner] 20:30:17
 AND COVERINGS AND PRETTY UP THE GLASS AND MAKE IT LOOK LIKE

[Captioner] 20:30:20
 IT'S ACTIVE AND
ARTISTIC.
EEN THOUGH MALL IS ALL

[Captioner] 20:30:24
 IF YOU OF DEAD STORES.
SO THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT TO DO HERE

[Captioner] 20:30:27
, THAT IS VERY MALL-ISTIC OR ARTISTIC

[Captioner] 20:30:30
 TO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO.
OR YOU

[Captioner] 20:30:33
 HAVE THIS CONCERN WITH ABOUT THE CHOU CHOU

[Captioner] 20:30:40
 CH

[Captioner] 20:30:45
 CHOOOO TRAINS

[Captioner] 20:30:49
 THAT HAVE LIVING IN THE FINEST

[Captioner] 20:30:52
 MODERN TECHNOLOGY TO TRY TO INTRODUCE THAT NOISE AND

[Captioner] 20:30:57
 I GUARANTEE NOBODY ELSE
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD HAS ANY ABILITY TO REDUCE

[Captioner] 20:31:00
 THAT NOISE.
WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN

[Captioner] 20:31:04
 DOING HERE?
THIS WHOLE DISCUSSION HAS BEEN IN AN

[Captioner] 20:31:07
 ETHEREAL PLANE OF THEORY AND

[Captioner] 20:31:10
 FANTASY AND TALKING ABOUT THE FUTURE.
IF YOU REALLY WANT TO FAST THIS

[Captioner] 20:31:14
 THING JUST GIVE THEM 18 MONTHS, NOT TWO YEARS, TELL THEM

[Captioner] 20:31:17
 TO START DIGGING THE DIRT AND DOING

[Captioner] 20:31:20
 SOMETHING REAL WITHIN 18 MONTHS OR

[Captioner] 20:31:24
 THEIR ENTITLEMENT FAILS OR WHATEVER IT
IS.

[Captioner] 20:31:27

WHATEVER YOU'VE DONE FOR THE TRAIN NOISE YOU HAVE DONE THE

[Captioner] 20:31:30
 MOST HUMANLY POSSIBLE, YOU LET SOMEBODY COME IN

[Captioner] 20:31:33
 TAKE AN EXISTING NEIGHBORHOOD OF OLD BUILDINGS AND DESTROY THEM ALL

[Captioner] 20:31:36
 SO THERE'S NOBODY THERE
ANYMORE AND THE WHOLE

[Captioner] 20:31:39
 THING IS A FOUR ACRE EMPTY

[Captioner] 20:31:43
 LOT AND THIS CITY HAS TURNED INTO AN EMPTY LIKE

[Captioner] 20:31:46
 A DOUGHNUT WITH AN

[Captioner] 20:31:49
 EMPTY CORE, COMPLETELY VACANT,

[Captioner] 20:31:52
 COMPLETELY -- THIS IS A DISASTER AND YOU'RE SITTING
HERE ARGUE ABOUT

[Captioner] 20:31:55
 NOISE LEVELS.
YOU'VE ALREADY ELIMINATED ALL THE NOISE.


[Captioner] 20:31:58
THERE'S NOBODY THERE TO LISTEN TO THEM.
WE NEED TO GET THIS THING

[Captioner] 20:32:01
 GOING AND HOW CAN YOU LET PEOPLE START DEMOLISHING

[Captioner] 20:32:05
 BUILDINGS WITHOUT ANY INSURANCE THAT BUILDINGS ARE ACTUALLY

[Captioner] 20:32:08
 ANY

[Captioner] 20:32:11
 ASSURANCE THAT BUILDINGS ARE ACTUALLY GOING TO GET

[Captioner] 20:32:15
 BUILT.
YOU THAT IS A SHAME.
YOU

[Captioner] 20:32:18
 ARE DEMOLISHING BUILDINGS

[Captioner] 20:32:22
 WITHOUT WITHOUT SHURG ANYTHING BETTER.

[Captioner] 20:32:24

>> Commissioner Daulton:   THANK YOU KELLY.


[Captioner] 20:32:28
AT THIS TIME WE'LL HAVE THE APPLICANT SPEAK TO ANY OF THE

[Captioner] 20:32:31
 COMMENTS THAT HE'S HEARD

[Captioner] 20:32:39
 We are he here if you have any questions.

[Captioner] 20:32:42
 Okay, thank you.
Commissioners, any further questions

[Captioner] 20:32:45

Seeing none, I

[Captioner] 20:32:48

[Captioner] 20:32:51
 motion.
>> I make motion to accept staff

[Captioner] 20:32:55

 letter to approve staff

[Captioner] 20:33:18

The vote is 6 in favor, none

[Captioner] 20:33:51
 opposed with one abstention approve the staff

[Captioner] 20:33:56
 recommendation.
Planning commission action on this is final, unless

[Captioner] 20:33:59
 it appeals once again.
>> That is a recusal,

[Captioner] 20:34:02
 not an abstention.
>>

[Captioner] 20:34:05
 Yes, story that.
>> That's what

[Captioner] 20:34:10
 I said.
>> All right so that's

[Captioner] 20:34:13
 the end of our agenda items.
See nothing discussion

[Captioner] 20:34:17
 items, do we have any special information from staff or the

[Captioner] 20:34:20
 commission at this time?
Any

[Captioner] 20:34:26
 announcements?
>> I

[Captioner] 20:34:30
 have one announcement, which is I am

[Captioner] 20:34:33
 laser focused on the city's housing

[Captioner] 20:34:36
 announcement it will come to you before

[Captioner] 20:34:39

That's before the break starts for the city.


[Captioner] 20:34:42
Friday is a holiday.
Get your hot cocoa and whatever

[Captioner] 20:34:46
 snacks and come to our meeting.
We've got

[Captioner] 20:34:49
 the housing element document on our website already it

[Captioner] 20:34:52
 has been there since August, I believe, when we gave it

[Captioner] 20:34:56
 to, in the draft form, when we gave it to the

[Captioner] 20:35:01
 state.
Speed hd provided comments on

[Captioner] 20:35:04
 that housing development and before

[Captioner] 20:35:07
 Thanksgiving and the comment letters are on the website

[Captioner] 20:35:10
 about four or five pages long, and our job now is

[Captioner] 20:35:14
 to respond to those comments from the state and bring it to

[Captioner] 20:35:17
 you.
Please do come, we need everybody at our

[Captioner] 20:35:21
 regularly-scheduled December 22 meeting so you can make a recommendation on

[Captioner] 20:35:24

And you

[Captioner] 20:35:27
 don't have to wait until the Friday before the meeting in

[Captioner] 20:35:31

[Captioner] 20:35:35
 to familiarize yourself with it early, we're going to

[Captioner] 20:35:38
 release the document early in the previous week and it is

[Captioner] 20:35:42
 already on the website, as mentioned.
Thank you.
>> Thank

[Captioner] 20:35:45

We're all root forget staff, I'm sure, on the

[Captioner] 20:35:48
 success of that document.
Any

[Captioner] 20:35:52

[Captioner] 20:35:55

>> I do.
Yeah, let me put the raised hand

[Captioner] 20:36:04

>> Okay.
Just, real quick,

[Captioner] 20:36:08
 I just came back from the league of California cities

[Captioner] 20:36:11
 meeting.
I attended with more than 100 city leaders throughout

[Captioner] 20:36:15
 California and I just wanted to share there's four items

[Captioner] 20:36:18
 that we developed

[Captioner] 20:36:21
 as an advocacy priors for 2023 so

[Captioner] 20:36:24
 I want to share real quick what they are.
That they're

[Captioner] 20:36:27
 trying to ensure for us at the state level so

[Captioner] 20:36:30
 first one is to protect and expand

[Captioner] 20:36:34
 investments to prevent and reduce homelessless.


[Captioner] 20:36:37
That's the first one.
Second is town address the

[Captioner] 20:36:40
 supply and affordability of housing while retaining

[Captioner] 20:36:43
 local decision making.
The third one is improve public safety

[Captioner] 20:36:47
 in California communities and the last one is

[Captioner] 20:36:50
 is to safeguard essential local revenues and

[Captioner] 20:36:53
 support fiscal sustainability family any of you want more

[Captioner] 20:36:57
 details, you can always reach out to me and I would be more than happy to

[Captioner] 20:37:00

[Captioner] 20:37:03
 things.
These are the four.
I can send to staff

[Captioner] 20:37:07

[Captioner] 20:37:10

>> All right.
Thank you,

[Captioner] 20:37:13

Admirable goals for any city.
