I CURRENTLY HAVE

[Captioner] 19:06:52
 NO FINANCIAL

[Captioner] 19:06:55
 RESIDENCE FOR 
ABOUT EIGHT YEARS.


[Captioner] 19:06:58

[Captioner] 19:07:06
 TO THE DEVELOPER OF

[Captioner] 19:07:09
 THE 
CAPITOL 101 PROJECT, AS WELL AS

BEHIND THE PROJECT.
ALL RIGHT

.
TRISH, WE'RE GOING TO GO TO

[Captioner] 19:07:51

KELLY A PLEASE GO AHEAD AND 
SPEAK, YOU HAVE

[Captioner] 19:07:53
 BEEN GIVEN 
PERMISSION.
>> THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:07:56
SO NICE TO HAVE THREE MINUTES TO 
SPEAK, A

[Captioner] 19:08:00
 LUXURIOUS AMOUNT OF 
TIME.
UNLIKE THE FREMONT CITY COUNCIL

[Captioner] 19:08:04
 
WHICH OFFERS 1 MINUTE AS OF TWO

[Captioner] 19:08:07
 
DAYS AGO.


[Captioner] 19:08:10
A LUDICROUS AMOUNT OF TIME.


[Captioner] 19:08:14
THE MISSION -- YOU KNOW, THERE'S 
VARIOUS NEIGHBORHOODS IN FREMONT

[Captioner] 19:08:17
 
AND NONE OF THEM IS GOING 
DOWNHILL AS FAST AS

[Captioner] 19:08:20
 THE MISSION 
SAN JOSE DOWNTOWN AREA WHICH IS 
DEAD.


[Captioner] 19:08:24
IT LOOKS LIKE A DOWNTOWN BUT WE 
DON'T HAVE THE BUSINESSES

[Captioner] 19:08:27
.
AND WE HAVE SO MANY PEOPLE THAT 
ARE COMING TO TREATMENT FROM ALL 


[Captioner] 19:08:30
OVER THE BAY AREA, THAT END UP

[Captioner] 19:08:33
 
AT MISSION PEAK.
AND THAT'S MORE OR LESS

[Captioner] 19:08:37
 A QUOTE 
FROM THE LOCALITY CITY COUNCIL 
AREA

[Captioner] 19:08:40
 REPRESENTING THAT AREA 
SPEAKING TWO DAYS AGO.
SO THE QUESTION

[Captioner] 19:08:44
 IS:  WHY HAVE 
WE, YOU KNOW, REMOVED

[Captioner] 19:08:47
 30% OF 
THOSE VISTAORS IN THE LAST FEW 
YEARS AND

[Captioner] 19:08:50
 WHAT HAS THAT DONE TO 
THE BUSINESSES

[Captioner] 19:08:53
 AT MISSION SAN 
JOSE?
WELL, THEY HAVE BEEN DESTROYED 

[Captioner] 19:08:56
.
EVEN THE BANK OF AMERICA, THERE 
WAS SOME KIND

[Captioner] 19:09:00
 OF A CRIME AND A 
CAR CRASH INTO

[Captioner] 19:09:03
 THE IMOIF AND 
WHEN I HEARD ABOUT THAT, I SAID 
THAT'S

[Captioner] 19:09:06
 NOT BANK OF AMERICA, THAT 
BUILDING'S CLOSED.
IF THE

[Captioner] 19:09:09
 CAR HAD BEEN CLOSED INTO 
STARBUCKS

[Captioner] 19:09:12
 IT WOULD HAVE BEEN 
CLOSED, IF

[Captioner] 19:09:17
 IT CRASHED INTO 
7-ELEVEN

[Captioner] 19:09:20
 THAT'S CLOSED TOO.
THERE'S QUITE A LIST

[Captioner] 19:09:22
 OF 
BUSINESSES THERE.
MISSION SAN JOSE IS CLOSED 


[Captioner] 19:09:25
BECAUSE OF YOUR PLANNING 
DEFICIENCIES, YOUR PLANNING, 
YOUR PLAN TO

[Captioner] 19:09:29
 NOT BUILD ENOUGH 
RESIDENTIAL SPACES

[Captioner] 19:09:32
 THERE AND 
THEN YOU EXPECT BUSINESSES TO 
SHOW UP

[Captioner] 19:09:35
 AND BUSINESSES DON'T 
SHOW UP

[Captioner] 19:09:38
.
BECAUSE THERE IS NO RESIDENCES 
THERE.


[Captioner] 19:09:41
AND THEN ALSO:  AT SABERCAT

[Captioner] 19:09:45
 ROAD 
WHICH IS THE NORTHEAST CORNER

[Captioner] 19:09:48
 OF 
DURHAM AND 680 THERE IS THIS

[Captioner] 19:09:51
 
ENORMOUS CONCRETE MONSTROSITY 
RIGHT THERE, THAT IS PART

[Captioner] 19:09:54
 OF THE 
MISSION SAN JOSE PLANNING 
DISTRICT ISN'T IT?


[Captioner] 19:09:57
THIS CONCRETE MONSTROSITY IS THE 
BEGINNINGS OF

[Captioner] 19:10:01
 AN APARTMENT 
BUILDING AND IT IS JUST SITTING 
THERE FOR FIVE YEARS.


[Captioner] 19:10:04
I THINK PART OF THE FIVE YEARS 
THEY WERE TRYING TO BUILD

[Captioner] 19:10:07
 IT.
BUT THEN A COUPLE OF YEARS IN IT 
WAS ABANDONED.

[Captioner] 19:10:11

SO, YOU KNOW, WHAT DOES THE CITY 
DO WHEN

[Captioner] 19:10:14
 YOU APPROVE THESE 
PROJECTS?
WHEN THEY

[Captioner] 19:10:17
 DON'T GET THESE 
PROJECTS DONE WHY CAN'T YOU -- 
YOU

[Captioner] 19:10:20
 KNOW WE SEND OUT POLICE TO 
TOW CARS,

[Captioner] 19:10:23
 MAYBE THE POLICE DON'T 
DO IT, MAYBE THE TOW

[Captioner] 19:10:26
 TRUCKS DO 
IT, BUT WHY DON'T THE

[Captioner] 19:10:30
 CODE 
ENFORCEMENT TO CLEAN UP GARBAGE,

[Captioner] 19:10:33
 
WHY DON'T WE SEND OUT THE 
DEMOLITION

[Captioner] 19:10:37
 CREWS TO BLOW UP THAT 
GARBAGE.
THIS HAS

[Captioner] 19:10:40
 TO GET CLEANED UP.
WE CAN'T HAVE THESE MONSTROSITY

[Captioner] 19:10:44

MONSTROSITIES, THEE FAILED 
PLANNING PROJECTS,

[Captioner] 19:10:47
 FAILED 
DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS ALL OVER 
THE CITY AND ESPECIALLY

[Captioner] 19:10:55
 AT 
MISSION SAN JOSE NORTHEAST 
CORNER OF

[Captioner] 19:10:58
 DURHAM RODE AND 680.
WHAT'S GOING

[Captioner] 19:11:01
 ON AT MISSION SAN 
JOSE IS A MESS.
THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 19:11:04

>> Commissioner Daulton:   THANK

SCHOOLS AND GOVERNMENT.
FREMONT NEEDS MORE TRAINED 


[Captioner] 19:31:07
CONSTRUCTION WORKERS TO MEET THE 
DEMAND FOR THE NEW HOUSING

[Captioner] 19:31:10
 AND 
MAJOR PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE 
PROJECTS THAT ARE

[Captioner] 19:31:13
 IN THE 
PIPELINE.
THESE DEVELOPERS WILL NEVER DO

[Captioner] 19:31:16
 
THE RIGHT THING AND PAY STANDARD

[Captioner] 19:31:19
 
WAGES ON THEIR OWN.
WITH YOUR LEADERSHIP WE COULD 


[Captioner] 19:31:22
SEND A MESSAGE TO ALL DEVELOPERS 
OF THE FREMONT AREA, WE WILL

[Captioner] 19:31:25
 NOT 
STAND FOR THE EXPORTATION

[Captioner] 19:31:28
 OF 
SKILLED CARPENTERS AND TRADE

[Captioner] 19:31:32
 
MEN'S AND SKILL WORKERS SO THEY 
CAN

[Captioner] 19:31:35
 INCREASE THEIR PROFITS.
WE WOULD VERY, VERY LOVE TO HAVE 
A

[Captioner] 19:31:39
 REAL VALUABLE MEETING WITH 
EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU TO

[Captioner] 19:31:43
 
ANSWER QUESTIONS YOU HAVE ABOUT 
WHAT

[Captioner] 19:31:46
 LABOR STANDARDS ARE AND 
WHAT LABOR STANDARDS

[Captioner] 19:31:49
 SHOULD LOOK 
LIKE.
LET ME LEAVE YOU WITH ONE

[Captioner] 19:31:52
 
QUESTION, HOW CAN YOU BETTER 
SUPPORT THE WORKING

[Captioner] 19:31:56
 CLASSMEN AND 
WOMEN OF OUR BEAUTIFUL AND 
DIVERSE CITY OF

[Captioner] 19:31:59
 CITY OF FREMONT, 
LET US KNOW HOW WE CAN HELP.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND

[Captioner] 19:32:04
 THE 
OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   THANK 


[Captioner] 19:32:07
YOU, MR. DOE.
MUCH APPRECIATED.
TRISH DO WE HAVE

[Captioner] 19:32:09
 ANOTHER 
SPEAKER?
>> Trish Cordova:   YES, WE HAVE 


[Captioner] 19:32:12
ANOTHER SPEAKER.
I'LL GO AHEAD AND INTRODUCE THE 
NEXT SPEAKER

[Captioner] 19:32:16
, KELLY A.
GO AHEAD AND SPEAK NOW.
YOU

[Captioner] 19:32:19
 HAVE PERMISSION.
>> THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 19:32:23

SO FIRST OFF, THIS DEVELOPMENT

[Captioner] 19:32:26
 
HAS 70 UNITS PER ACRE, WHICH IS

[Captioner] 19:32:29
 
FAR MORE THAN WHAT THEY HAVE 
OVER THERE TOWARDS

[Captioner] 19:32:32
 THE WARM 
SPRINGS

[Captioner] 19:32:35
 INNOVATION DISTRICT, IT 
IS ONE OF THE HIGHEST DENSITIES

[Captioner] 19:32:38
 
AROUND, SO THAT MAKES THAT MEANS 
THAT I'M --

[Captioner] 19:32:42
 I GENERALLY SUPPORT 
THIS PROJECT.
THERE ARE FOUR

[Captioner] 19:32:45
 SUPERMARKETS 
WITHIN 2,000 FEET,

[Captioner] 19:32:48
 IN EVERY 
DIRECTION.
THERE ARE -- THERE'S

[Captioner] 19:32:51
 A BART 
STATION WITHIN WALKING DISTANCE

[Captioner] 19:32:55
.
SO IN MANY WAYS, THIS IS A GREAT

[Captioner] 19:32:58
 
PLACE TO PUT A LOT OF HOUSING.
HOWEVER:

[Captioner] 19:33:01
  THIS EXCEPTIONAL 
DESIGN BUILDING IS NOT --

[Captioner] 19:33:04
 IS 
EXCEPTIONAL FROM THE POINT OF 
VIEW OF THE BAY AREA BUT NOT

[Captioner] 19:33:08
 -- 
BUT TRULY FOLLOWS THE

[Captioner] 19:33:11
 FREMONT

[Captioner] 19:33:15
 
DEGRADED OR OLD FASHIONED OR

[Captioner] 19:33:18
 
STUPID DESIGN PLANNING, WHICH 
IS, WE HAVE

[Captioner] 19:33:22
 TWO PARKING SPACES 
FOR EVERY UNIT.
THAT MEANS THAT FOR

[Captioner] 19:33:25
 EVERY ONE 
SQUARE FOOT OF RESIDENTIAL 
SPACE, YOU

[Captioner] 19:33:28
 HAVE ZERO.55 SQUARE

[Captioner] 19:33:31
 
FEET OF PARKING BUILT INTO THIS 
THING.

[Captioner] 19:33:35

IF YOU LOOK AT OTHER KIND OF 
HIGH DENSITY RESIDENTIAL

[Captioner] 19:33:38
 HOUSING 
UNITS, THAT ARE STRATEGICALLY 
URBAN

[Captioner] 19:33:41
, REALLY STRATEGICALLY 
URBAN ALL ACROSS THE BAY AREA

[Captioner] 19:33:44
 OR 
ACROSS AMERICA, YOU'LL FIND THAT 
TWO PARKING SPACES

[Captioner] 19:33:47
 PER UNIT IN A 
DENSE DOWNTOWN IS LUDICROUS

[Captioner] 19:33:51
LY 
HIGH.
AND THEN THIS IDEA OF THE

[Captioner] 19:33:54
 
QUESTIONS THAT CAME UP TODAY.
EVENTS MAY

[Captioner] 19:33:57
 -- THAT THIS BUILDING 
MAY CONFLICT WITH

[Captioner] 19:34:00
 EVENTS.
WELL ONCE YOU PUT 90 UNITS

[Captioner] 19:34:03
 IN 
THERE, THOSE RESIDENTS HAVE THE 
RIGHT TO THE PEACE

[Captioner] 19:34:07
FUL ENJOYMENT 
OF HEALTH AND WELL-BEING OF ALL

[Captioner] 19:34:10
 
THE INHABITANTS AND

[Captioner] 19:34:14
 IF YOUR 
EVENTS ARE INTERFERING WITH 
THEIR RESIDENCES

[Captioner] 19:34:17
 THEN YOUR 
EVENTS HAVE GOT TO GO, YOU KNOW.
AND THEN

[Captioner] 19:34:20
 ALSO THIS IDEA OF WE'RE 
GOING TO HAVE OPPOSITION FROM 
THE

[Captioner] 19:34:23
 NEIGHBORS TO BUILDING THE 
RESIDENCES HERE.
WELL YOU KNOW IT'S

[Captioner] 19:34:26
 ALMOST LIKE 
YOU BUILT A NICE RESIDENCES NEXT 
TO

[Captioner] 19:34:30
 A RED LIGHT DISTRICT OR NEXT 
TO A NEIGHBORING

[Captioner] 19:34:33
 BAR OWNER IS 
COMPLAINING OR THE PURVEYOR OF 
TOXIC AND

[Captioner] 19:34:36
 ADDICTIVE SUBSTANCES 
STARTS TO COMPLAIN ABOUT THE 
NEIGHBORS

[Captioner] 19:34:39
.
WELL, YOU KNOW, IN THE END OF 
COURSE THEY CAN

[Captioner] 19:34:42
 SEE WHAT'S 
COMING.
THEY CAN SEE THAT THOSE 


[Captioner] 19:34:45
NEIGHBORS MIGHT NOT LIKE HAVING 
A BAR OR A TOXIC AND

[Captioner] 19:34:48
 ADDICTIVE 
SUBSTANCES BEING PURVEYED THIS 
THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD

[Captioner] 19:34:52
, MIGHT NOT 
LIKE THAT KIND OF STUFF AND 
MIGHT

[Captioner] 19:34:55
 PUSH BACK THE OTHER WAY.
SO YEAH, THIS IS GOING TO BE

[Captioner] 19:34:58
 
GREAT FOR FREMONT.
IT'S GOT WAY TOO MUCH PARKING.

[Captioner] 19:35:01

TWO PARKING SPACES PER UNIT IS

[Captioner] 19:35:04
 
OBSCENE, OBSCENELY HIGH.
AND WE NEED TO CLEAN UP

[Captioner] 19:35:07
 THE 
DOWNTOWN SO WE DON'T HAVE SO 
MANY TOXIC AND

[Captioner] 19:35:11
 DICTIVE 
SUBSTANCES BEING PEDALED AROUND 
AND

[Captioner] 19:35:14
 I'M SURE ONCE WE PUT IN 90 
UNITS

[Captioner] 19:35:17
 IN THERE, THOSE PEOPLE 
WILL HELP TO GET THIS CITY

[Captioner] 19:35:20
 
CLEANED UP, THANKS.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   THANK 


[Captioner] 19:35:23
YOU AGAIN KELLY.
TRISH, IS THAT IT FOR OUR

[Captioner] 19:35:26
 PUBLIC 
COMMENT?
>> Trish Cordova:   CHAIR 


[Captioner] 19:35:29
DAULTON WE DO HAVE TWO MORE 
RAISED HANDS.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   OH

[Captioner] 19:35:31

[Captioner] 19:35:34
TO CONTINUE WITH TWO MINUTES PER 
SPEAKER?
>> Commissioner Daulton:   IS

[Captioner] 19:35:37
 
THAT WHAT WE -- I THOUGHT WE 
WERE GOING THREE.


[Captioner] 19:35:40
>> Trish Cordova:   I WASN'T 
SURE.
WE'LL DO THE THREE THEN, SORRY 


[Captioner] 19:35:43
ABOUT THAT.
I'M INTRODUCE THE FIRST SPEAKER,

[Captioner] 19:35:46
 
NIKUN SHARMA.


[Captioner] 19:35:49
GO AHEAD AND SPEAK.
YOU HAVE THREE MINUTES.

[Captioner] 19:35:52

>> CAN YOU ALL HEAR ME?
>> Trish Cordova:   YES.


[Captioner] 19:35:55
>> I HAVE BEEN LIVING IN FREMONT 
FOR LAST TEN YEARS AND WHEN

[Captioner] 19:35:59
 I 
VISIT OTHER PLACES I GO TO 
DOWNTOWN AND I REALLY

[Captioner] 19:36:02
 ENJOY IT.

[Captioner] 19:36:05

HAVING DOWNTOWN THIS HIGH

[Captioner] 19:36:08
 CLASS 
ESTABLISHMENT, SOMETIMES UPSET 
ME BECAUSE

[Captioner] 19:36:11
 I JUST DON'T FEEL, 
YOU KNOW, THAT LATE

[Captioner] 19:36:15
EST 
ARCHITECTURE AND SPENDING TIME 
WITH MY FAMILY IN DOWNTOWN 


[Captioner] 19:36:18
EATING AND HAVING FUN THERE, AND 
AT TIMES I HAVE TO GO OTHER

[Captioner] 19:36:20
 
PLACES BECAUSE I DO NOT HAVE 
THOSE THINGS.


[Captioner] 19:36:24
SO I KIND OF FAVOR THIS 
PARTICULAR PROJECT,

[Captioner] 19:36:27
 AFTER 
HEARING THE DESCRIPTION THAT IS 
GOING

[Captioner] 19:36:31
 TO BE LATER IN CLASS 
ISSUED

[Captioner] 19:36:34
 LAWN BUILDINGS AND 
BUSINESS AND LOUNGES

[Captioner] 19:36:37
.
I'M ALSO A BUSINESSMAN WHERE I 
AM LOOKING FOR A PLACE

[Captioner] 19:36:41
 WHERE, 
YOU KNOW, I CAN SET A BIG

[Captioner] 19:36:44
 
BUSINESS WHICH WILL BE CLOSE TO 
THE COMMUNITIES AND WHERE THE

[Captioner] 19:36:46
 
ACCESS TO THE LOT OF THE 
BUSINESS BUT ALSO THE 


[Captioner] 19:36:50
COMMUNITIES CAN GET ACCESS TO 
THOSE SERVICES.
AND WE HAVE

[Captioner] 19:36:53
 PLACES IN FREMONT, 
BUT

[Captioner] 19:36:56
 NOT THE HIGH CLASS LUXURY 
PLACE WHERE WE CAN HAVE

[Captioner] 19:36:59
 A HIGH 
LUXURY BUSINESS AND ALSO PEOPLE 
WHO CAN AFFORD

[Captioner] 19:37:02
 AND WANT TO 
ASSUME THOSE BUSINESSES COMING 
TOGETHER.


[Captioner] 19:37:06
SO FROM MY SIDE, I AM IN FULL 
SUPPORT OF

[Captioner] 19:37:09
 THIS PROJECT.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   THANK 
YOU

[Captioner] 19:37:12
 MR. SHARMA.
TRISH DO WE HAVE ANOTHER SPEAKER

[Captioner] 19:37:14

>> Trish Cordova:   HI, I'M 


[Captioner] 19:37:17

[Captioner] 19:37:20
 MOMENT.
OKAY HERE WE GO.
YES I DO SEE WE HAVE

[Captioner] 19:37:22
 ANOTHER 
SPEAKER.
I'LL GO AHEAD AND INTRODUCE THE 


[Captioner] 19:37:26
SPEAKER.
ADITA PRASA

[Captioner] 19:37:29
D.
GO AHEAD AND SPEAK YOU HAVE 
PERMISSION.


[Captioner] 19:37:32
YOU HAVE THREE MINUTES.
>> HI, CAN YOU HEAR ME OKAY

[Captioner] 19:37:36
?
>> Trish Cordova:   YES.
>> THANK YOU EVERYONE FOR 


[Captioner] 19:37:39
REVIEWING THIS PARTICULAR 
PROJECT.
MY NAME IS ADIT

[Captioner] 19:37:42
IA, I'M A LONG 
TIME RESIDENT OF FREMONT.

[Captioner] 19:37:46

I WORK TO SOUTH BAY.
I

[Captioner] 19:37:50
 COMMUTE TO SOUTH BAY TO WORK.
BUT I ALSO BELIEVE

[Captioner] 19:37:53
 THAT WE ARE 
LACKING A NEW

[Captioner] 19:37:57
ER DOWNTOWN, FEEL 
THAT PLACES

[Captioner] 19:38:00
 LIKE MOUNTAIN VIEW 
PALO ALTO OR

[Captioner] 19:38:04
 EVEN SUNNYVALE 
HAVE.
SO THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT I

[Captioner] 19:38:07
 
BELIEVE WILL HELP US IMMENSELY, 
IN

[Captioner] 19:38:10
 HAVING MORE RESIDENTS LIVING 
CLOSE

[Captioner] 19:38:13
 TO RESTAURANTS AND OTHER 
BUSINESSES.


[Captioner] 19:38:16
SO I ALSO WANT TO SHOW MY 
SUPPORT FOR

[Captioner] 19:38:19
 THIS PARTICULAR 
PROJECT, AND I HOPE

[Captioner] 19:38:22
 THAT THE 
PLANNING TEAM HERE WILL APPROVE 
IT

[Captioner] 19:38:25
.
THAT'S ALL I WANTED TO SAY.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME

[Captioner] 19:38:28
.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   THANK 
YOU, MR. 


[Captioner] 19:38:32
PRASAD

[Captioner] 19:38:37
.
TRISH IF THAT IS ALL THE 
SPEAKERS --

[Captioner] 19:38:39

>> Trish Cordova:   CHAIR 
DAULTON WE DO HAVE ANOTHER 


[Captioner] 19:38:42
RAISED HAND.
I'LL GO AHEAD AND INTRODUCE THE 
NEXT

[Captioner] 19:38:46
 SPEAKER.
LISA DARCHES

[Captioner] 19:38:49
 DANCE, GO AHEAD AND YOU 
HAVE THREE MINUTES.

[Captioner] 19:38:52

>> THANK YOU, SORRY FOR THE LAST 
MINUTE I'LL KEEP

[Captioner] 19:38:56
 THIS QUICK.
I WANT TO AGREE WITH THE OTHER 
SPEAKERS

[Captioner] 19:38:59
, YES I'M IN AGREEMENT 
WITH THIS PROJECT

[Captioner] 19:39:02
, YES MORE 
DENSE HOUSING DOWNTOWN.
I

[Captioner] 19:39:05
 WANT TO ECHO KELLY

[Captioner] 19:39:08
'S COMMENTS, 
TOO MUCH PARKING

[Captioner] 19:39:12
 DOWNTOWN.
I THINK WE NEED

[Captioner] 19:39:15
 MORE HOUSING, 
LESS PARKING, ESPECIALLY IN HIGH 
TRANSIT

[Captioner] 19:39:19
 ZONES.
SO I DON'T THINK

[Captioner] 19:39:22
 THAT SHOULD 
NECESSARILY CHANGE HOW YOU 
ADDRESS THIS

[Captioner] 19:39:25
 ONE BUT I WOULD 
LOVE TO SEE THAT GOING FORWARD 
FAVORING

[Captioner] 19:39:28
 LESS PARKING.
THANK YOU.
>> Commissioner Daulton:  

[Captioner] 19:39:32
 THANK 
YOU LISA, TRISH IS

[Captioner] 19:39:35
 THAT IT?
>> Trish Cordova:   THANK YOU, I 
NEED TO REMOVE

[Captioner] 19:39:40
 THE TIMER.
THAT IS IT NO MORE SPEAKERS.
THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 19:39:41

>> Commissioner Daulton:   THANK 
YOU TRISH.


[Captioner] 19:39:44
IN THAT CASE I WOULD LIKE TO 
INVITE THE APPLICANT BACK IF 
THEY HAVE ANYTHING FURTHER

[Captioner] 19:39:48
 TO 
SAY THIS IS THE TIME.


[Captioner] 19:39:51
>> I THINK WE HAVE LEARNED

[Captioner] 19:39:54
 
EVERYTHING ABOUT THE PROJECT ON 
THIS, WE HAVE DESIGNED THE 


[Captioner] 19:39:57
PARKING BECAUSE THE NEIGHBORS 
WERE COMPLAINING THAT

[Captioner] 19:40:00
 IT'S NOT 
ENOUGH PARKING.
AND SPILLOVER CAN COME

[Captioner] 19:40:03
 TO THEIR 
PARKING LOT.
SO THAT'S

[Captioner] 19:40:07
 THE REASON WE PUT MORE 
PARKING SPACE

[Captioner] 19:40:10
.
THE PARKING ON THE SECOND FLOORS 
ARE

[Captioner] 19:40:13
 MECHANICAL LIFT-PARKING.
WE WILL ONLY PLACE THOSE IF

[Captioner] 19:40:17
 IT'S 
NEEDED BY THE RESIDENTS.

[Captioner] 19:40:20

SO EVEN THOUGH

[Captioner] 19:40:23
 IF TIMED OUT, WE 
CAN ALWAYS REDUCE

[Captioner] 19:40:27
 IT IF IT'S NOT 
NEEDED BY THE

[Captioner] 19:40:28
 RESIDENTS IN THE 
BUILDING.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   


[Captioner] 19:40:32
INTERESTING, THANK YOU MR. KHANN

[Captioner] 19:40:35

MR. KHANNA.
I'M GOING TO CLOSE THE PUBLIC 


[Captioner] 19:40:38
HEARING THEN AND ASK 
COMMISSIONERS IF THEY HAVE ANY 
FURTHER

[Captioner] 19:40:41
 QUESTIONS OF STAFF, OR 
GENERAL DISCUSSION ON THIS

[Captioner] 19:40:44
 ITEM.


[Captioner] 19:40:50
ANYBODY, QUESTIONS, COMMENTS

[Captioner] 19:40:54
?
NOTHING?
OKAY

[Captioner] 19:40:57
.
OH.


[Captioner] 19:41:00
COMMISSIONER YEE.
THANK YOU.
>> Commissioner Yee:   YES,

[Captioner] 19:41:03
 IT'S 
JUST MORE A COMMENT.
YOU KNOW, BASED ON TALKING TO

[Captioner] 19:41:06
 
ALL THE BUSINESSES IN THE AREA, 
I KNOW THAT

[Captioner] 19:41:10
 THIS DEVELOPER WAS 
VERY COGNIZANT ABOUT MAKING

[Captioner] 19:41:13
 SURE 
THAT THERE IS AN ISSUE WITH OVER

[Captioner] 19:41:16

OVERFILL -- OVERSPILL PARKING.
BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THERE'S

[Captioner] 19:41:19
 A 
SUPERMARKET THERE, THAT'S

[Captioner] 19:41:22
 
LITERALLY RIGHT NEXT DOOR.
SPOKE WITH THE OWNER-MANAGER

[Captioner] 19:41:25
 
THERE.
AND I'M JUST GLAD TO HEAR THAT

[Captioner] 19:41:29
, 
YOU KNOW, THIS DEVELOPER IS 
ACTUALLY REACHING OUT TO THE

[Captioner] 19:41:32
 
COMMUNITY TO HEAR WHAT THEIR 
CONCERNS ARE

[Captioner] 19:41:35
.
THE OTHER THING, TOO, I KNOW 
THAT SPEAKING WITH MANY OF THE

[Captioner] 19:41:38
 
BUSINESS OWNERS IN THE AREA, 
THEY FEEL LIKE THIS PROJECT

[Captioner] 19:41:43
 WILL 
REACTIVATE THAT AREA.
BECAUSE IT DOESN'T LOOK

[Captioner] 19:41:46
 TOO GOOD 
TO HAVE A ONE AND A

[Captioner] 19:41:49
 QUARTER ACRE 
SITE THAT'S JUST SITTING THERE 
THAT'S JUST A DIRT

[Captioner] 19:41:53
 LOT.
SO AT LEAST I JUST WANTED TO 
SHARE WITH THE COMMISSION WHAT

[Captioner] 19:41:56
 I 
HAD FOUND OUT WHEN I WAS 
SPEAKING WITH PEOPLE,

[Captioner] 19:41:59
 BUSINESS 
OWNERS AND EVEN RESIDENTS IN THE 
AREA ALIKE AS TO WHAT

[Captioner] 19:42:00
 THEIR 
THOUGHTS WERE ABOUT THIS 
PROJECT.


[Captioner] 19:42:05
>> Commissioner Daulton:   THANK 
YOU COMMISSIONER YEE.
ANYONE ELSE

[Captioner] 19:42:09
?
I WOULD -- I GUESS I'LL SAY THAT

[Captioner] 19:42:12
 
I ALSO SPOKE WITH SOME OF THE 
BUSINESS

[Captioner] 19:42:15
ES AROUND HERE, AND THEY 
TOLD ME THE SAME THING YOU

[Captioner] 19:42:19
 DID.
THAT THEY WERE

[Captioner] 19:42:22
 WORRIED THAT 
PARKING WAS GOING TO SPILL OVER 
INTO THEIR PRIVATE

[Captioner] 19:42:26
 LOT, WHICH 
THERE ARE -- THERE'S 
CONSIDERABLE SPACE

[Captioner] 19:42:29
S AROUND 
THERE.
BUT I DO HAVE TO SAY

[Captioner] 19:42:32
 THAT I KIND 
OF AGREE WITH SOME OF OUR

[Captioner] 19:42:35
 
COMMENTS TONIGHT, THAT IT IS --

[Captioner] 19:42:38
 
DOES SEEM TO BE

[Captioner] 19:42:41
 OVERPARKED, IN A 
WAY.
I MEAN, IT DOES

[Captioner] 19:42:45
 HAVE A ROBUST 
TRANSIT ACCESS TO THIS

[Captioner] 19:42:48
 PROJECT.

[Captioner] 19:42:52

I THINK IT'S SOMEWHAT OF A 
MISSED OPPORTUNITY.


[Captioner] 19:42:55
WE GOT ONE LETTER TONIGHT WHICH 
STATED THAT THOSE PARKING

[Captioner] 19:42:58
 SPACES 
COST $30,000 EACH AND I THINK WE 
ALL

[Captioner] 19:43:02
 KNOW THAT'S PROBABLY A 
LOW-BALL ON

[Captioner] 19:43:05
 THAT FIGURE IN TERMS 
OF WHAT THAT TRANSLATES TO THE 
PRICE OF EACH

[Captioner] 19:43:08
 OF THESE UNITS.

[Captioner] 19:43:14

I REALIZE IT IS A CONVENIENCE TO 
THE BUSINESSES AROUND THERE.

[Captioner] 19:43:19

BUT AGAIN, THIS STRIKES ME AS A 
MISSED OPPORTUNITY TO BRING IN A 


[Captioner] 19:43:22
LOWER PRICE ON THESE.
AS WELL

[Captioner] 19:43:26
,

[Captioner] 19:43:33
 THERE IS ONE 560 SQUARE 
FOOT UNIT

[Captioner] 19:43:36
 IN THIS DEVELOPMENT, 
THAT STRIKES ME AS

[Captioner] 19:43:39
 ANOTHER 
MISSED OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE MORE 
OF THOSE SMALLER

[Captioner] 19:43:42
 UNITS INTO THIS 
PROJECT TO ALLOW A SOMEWHAT 
LOWER

[Captioner] 19:43:46
-INCOME PERSON,

[Captioner] 19:43:49
 ALTHOUGH 
STILL OBVIOUSLY IT'S NOT GOING 
TO BE DIRT

[Captioner] 19:43:52
 CHEAP OR ANYTHING OR 
AFFORDABLE OR

[Captioner] 19:43:55
 ANYTHING LIKE THAT 
BUT A SMALLER UNIT WOULD HAVE 
ALLOWED

[Captioner] 19:43:58
 FOR MAYBE A GREATER 
RANGE OF PERSONS LIVING THERE

[Captioner] 19:44:02
.
AND IT SOUNDS AS IF, HEARING

[Captioner] 19:44:05
 THE 
APPLICANT SPEAK TONIGHT, THAT 
THE PLANS FOR THIS PROJECT ARE

[Captioner] 19:44:08
 
STILL SOMEWHAT MALLEABLE.
IF THAT'S THE CASE, I

[Captioner] 19:44:12
 WOULD 
ENCOURAGE YOU TO LOOK AT

[Captioner] 19:44:15
 
INCLUDING MORE SMALLER UNITS IN 
THE 5

[Captioner] 19:44:18
50 SQUARE FOOT RANGE.
BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO

[Captioner] 19:44:21
 FIND A 
GREAT MARKET FOR THAT, AS IF 
THERE'S

[Captioner] 19:44:24
 NOT A GREAT MARKET FOR 
ANY KIND OF HOUSING AROUND HERE.


[Captioner] 19:44:33
I WOULD ALSO ASK OF THE STAFF 
WHAT ABOUT THE

[Captioner] 19:44:36
 ISSUE RAISED BY 
THE LABOR CALL HERE?
DO WE

[Captioner] 19:44:39
 HAVE -- DO WE HAVE ANY 
GUIDANCE ON THAT

[Captioner] 19:44:44
 THAT YOU CAN 
OFFER?

[Captioner] 19:44:49


>> Planner Pullen:   I'M NOT

[Captioner] 19:44:52
 
CERTAIN CHAIR DAULTON WHAT ISSUE 
SPECIFICALLY FROM THE NEIGHBORS,

[Captioner] 19:44:55
 
THE PARKING ISSUE OR --
>> Commissioner Daulton:   NO, 


[Captioner] 19:44:59
FROM THE MAN WITH THE CARPENTERS 
UNION I BELIEVE.


[Captioner] 19:45:02
>> Planner Pullen:   SORRY, I 
THOUGHT YOU SAID NEIGHBOR.
I APOLOGIZE

[Captioner] 19:45:07
.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   
MR. HAROLD.

[Captioner] 19:45:10

IS THE

[Captioner] 19:48:46
 RADIOARON TOWN HOMES IN 
THE

[Captioner] 19:48:53
 APPROVAL OF A 
DISCRETIONARY DESIGN REVIEW A 
TERVE

[Captioner] 19:48:57
 TRACT MAP AND A PRIVATE

THE GENERAL PLAN.

[Captioner] 19:49:16

THE ZONING IS MULTIFAMILY

[Captioner] 19:49:52
TO REVISE THE DESIGN TO BETTER 
CONFORM

[Captioner] 19:49:55
 TO THE APPLICABLE DESIGN 
STANDARDS.
FOR EXAMPLE THE ORIGINAL 


[Captioner] 19:49:58
PROPOSAL WOULD HAVE HAD THE TOWN 
HOME BUILDINGS VERY CLOSE TO THE 
PROPERTY

[Captioner] 19:50:02
 LINE.
THIS WAS CHANGED TO THE CURRENT 
PROPOSAL

[Captioner] 19:50:05
 WHICH SET THE BUILDINGS 
BACK FROM THE STREET PROPERTY 
LINE

[Captioner] 19:50:09
 IN CONFORMANCE

[Captioner] 19:50:11
 WITH THE 
PROJECT SET BACK.
THE PROJECT WOULD HAVE PLACED 


[Captioner] 19:50:15
THE PARKING CLOSE TO THE 
PROPERTY LINES WHEREAS THE 
CURRENT PROPOSAL HAS

[Captioner] 19:50:18
 THEM SET 
BACK IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE 
DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS WHICH

[Captioner] 19:50:21
 
ALLOWS FOR ADDITIONAL LANDSCAPE 
AND

[Captioner] 19:50:24
 
AROUND THE PERIMETER OF THE 
SITE.


[Captioner] 19:50:27
THE ORIGINAL PROPOSAL WAS FOR 3-

[Captioner] 19:50:30

3-STORY TOWN HOMES UTILIZING A

[Captioner] 19:50:33
 
MODERN ARCHITECTURAL STYLE.
THE BLOCKY DISOIN HAD

[Captioner] 19:50:37
 DESIGN HAD

[Captioner] 19:50:40
 FLAT ROOFS 
AND LIMITED TIRL CHANGES.

[Captioner] 19:50:43

THE PLAN HAS EVOLVED TO A 
SPANISH

[Captioner] 19:50:47
 STYLE, MULTIUNIT

[Captioner] 19:50:49
 
DEVELOPMENT ALONG CENTRAL 
AFTERNOON.


[Captioner] 19:50:52
THE PROPOSED PROJECT CONTAINS 
TEN

[Captioner] 19:50:55
 ATTACHED TOWN HOMES IN THREE 
SEPARATE BUILDINGS, A CENTRAL

[Captioner] 19:50:59
 
STREET ALLOWS ACCESS TO THE 
PRIVATE GARAGES AS WELL AS THE 


[Captioner] 19:51:02
FIVE GUEST PARKING SPACES.
THE PERIMETER OF THE

[Captioner] 19:51:05
 SITE 
FEATURES LANDSCAPE INCLUDING 
TREES AND

[Captioner] 19:51:08
 SHRUBS ORIENTED TO

[Captioner] 19:51:12
 
PROVIDE PRIVACY SCREENING FOR 
THE

[Captioner] 19:51:15
 NEIGHBORING RESIDENCES.
IN ACCORDANCE TO THE

[Captioner] 19:51:19
 MULTIDESIGN 
GUIDELINES, THE BUILDINGS

[Captioner] 19:51:22
 HAVE 
PITCH AND ARTICULATION

[Captioner] 19:51:25

[Captioner] 19:51:35
 
CLADDING, SOME FEATURE SHUTTERS

[Captioner] 19:51:38
 
TO ENHANCE THE ARCHITECTURE.
THE ARCHITECTURE WOULD CONFORM

[Captioner] 19:51:42
 
TO THE STANDARDS CREATED IN THE 
R-3 ZONING AND

[Captioner] 19:51:45
 THE MULTIFAMILY 
DESIGN GUIDELINES.
STAFF RECOMMENDS THAT THE

[Captioner] 19:51:48
 
PLANNING COMMISSION FIND THE 
PROJECT EXEMPT FROM CEQA FOR THE

YOU,

[Captioner] 19:52:06
 JAMES.
COMMISSION, DO WE HAVE ANY

[Captioner] 19:52:09
 
QUESTIONS FOR STAFF ON THIS?
COMMISSIONER YEE PLEASE

[Captioner] 19:52:13
.
>> Commissioner Yee:   YES.
JAMES, YOU KNOW,

[Captioner] 19:52:16
 THERE'S THE -- 
I THINK THE THREE STORY 
BUILDINGS THAT ARE

[Captioner] 19:52:19
 NEARBY, DO 
YOU KNOW ROUGHLY HOW TALL THOSE 
ARE

[Captioner] 19:52:23
?

[Captioner] 19:52:27

>> SORRY, I DON'T HAVE THEIR 
HEIGHT READILY AVAILABLE BUT

[Captioner] 19:52:31
 
THESE BUILDINGS WILL BE A LITTLE 
BIT SHORTER THAN THEM I BELIEVE

[Captioner] 19:52:33
.
ABOUT THE SAME.
>> Commissioner Yee:   I WAS 


[Captioner] 19:52:36
JUST THINKING, I KNOW I WAS THE

[Captioner] 19:52:39
 
ONE ASKING ABOUT THESE THINGS 
BEING 28 FEET.


[Captioner] 19:52:42
I WAS TRYING TO

[Captioner] 19:52:46
 VISUALIZE A 
THREE STORY BUILDING, TRYING

[Captioner] 19:52:49
 TO 
ACCOMMODATE THAT HEIGHT AND THE 
OTHER THREE

[Captioner] 19:52:52
 STORY BUILDINGS 
NEARBY THEY LOOK MORE CLOSER TO

[Captioner] 19:52:56
 
LIKE 33 I GUESS IS KIND OF WHAT 
I'M THINKING.


[Captioner] 19:52:59
>> THEY MAY BE A LITTLE BIT 
TALLER.
I DON'T HAVE THEIR HEIGHT

[Captioner] 19:53:02
 
READILY AVAILABLE BUT --
>> Commissioner Yee:   SIMILAR 


[Captioner] 19:53:05
IS WHAT YOU'RE SAYING?
>> YES.

[Captioner] 19:53:06

>> Commissioner Yee:   OKAY 
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:53:09
>> Commissioner Daulton:   ANY 
OTHER COMMISSIONERS?
COMMISSIONER BASRAI.


[Captioner] 19:53:12
>> Commissioner Basrai:   SO 
THIS MAY BE A QUESTION, YOU 
KNOW, FOR WHAT'S AROUND

[Captioner] 19:53:16
 THERE 
AND LIKE I SAID, I DISCLOSE THAT 
I LIVED THERE FOR A

[Captioner] 19:53:19
 LITTLE 
WHILE.
ARE ANY OF THESE

[Captioner] 19:53:22
 UNITS GOING TO 
BE CONSIDERED FOR LOW INCOME?
ARE THERE UNITS

[Captioner] 19:53:25
 AROUND IT THAT 
ARE LOW INCOME?
JUST KNOWING WHAT THE 


[Captioner] 19:53:28
NEIGHBORHOOD IS LIKE,

[Captioner] 19:53:34
 IS THERE 
ANY PLAN FOR HAVING SOME

[Captioner] 19:53:37
 (U) 
DESIGNATED FOR THAT?
MAYBE I NEED TO WAIT FOR THE

[Captioner] 19:53:41
 
APPLICANT TO ASK BUT SEEING IT 
GROW UP OVER THE

[Captioner] 19:53:44
 LAST TEN YEARS 
AND SEEING THE APARTMENTS AND 
OTHER

[Captioner] 19:53:47
 UNITS AROUND THERE, THAT 
HAVE

[Captioner] 19:53:50
, YOU KNOW, THIS -- JUST 
WONDERING IF THERE IS

[Captioner] 19:53:53
 ANY PLAN 
FOR THAT OR SHOULD I ASK THE 
APPLICANT?


[Captioner] 19:53:56
>> I CAN'T SPEAK FOR OTHER 
PROJECTS.
WITH THIS ONE MY

[Captioner] 19:53:59
 UNDERSTANDING 
IS THE APPLICANT IS PLANNING ON 
PAYING THE

[Captioner] 19:54:03
 IN LIEU FEE FOR 
AFFORDABLE HOUSING.

[Captioner] 19:54:06

>> Commissioner Basrai:   OKAY.

[Captioner] 19:54:09

>> Commissioner Daulton:   
ANYONE ELSE?


[Captioner] 19:54:12
IN THAT CASE JAMES COULD YOU 
TELL US A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT 
THE

[Captioner] 19:54:17
 PRIVACY CONCERNS OF THE 
NEARBY RESIDENTS ON WHAT IS THAT

[Captioner] 19:54:20

THAT, IS THAT THE WEST SIDE OF 
THE BUILDING THERE

[Captioner] 19:54:23
?
>> THE HOMES ALONG ARGYLE

[Captioner] 19:54:27
?
>> Commissioner Daulton:   NO, 
THE NEIGHBORS ON --


[Captioner] 19:54:30
>> THE LARGER BUILDING BEHIND?
>> Commissioner Daulton:   YES.

[Captioner] 19:54:33

>> SO THE BUILDINGS, THEY WORKED 
WITH STAFF

[Captioner] 19:54:37
 TO PROVIDE SOME 
ANALYSIS OF HOW THE WINDOWS 
WOULD ALIGN WITH THE

[Captioner] 19:54:40
 OTHER 
BUILDING.
THEY ADJUSTED THE WINDOWS SO 


[Captioner] 19:54:43
THAT THEY WERE NOT DIRECTLY 
LOOKING ONTO THEM IN MOST CASES

[Captioner] 19:54:46
.
THEY DID PROVIDE TREES

[Captioner] 19:54:49
 AND 
SHRUBS ALL ALONG THE PROXIMITY 

[Captioner] 19:54:52
 PERIMETER 
WHICH WILL PROVIDE A

[Captioner] 19:54:55
 GREEN 
SCREEN.
THE WAY THE WINDOWS ARE ORIENTED

[Captioner] 19:54:58

ORIENTED, WITH THE WINDOWS 
FACING OUT

[Captioner] 19:55:02
 TOWARDS THOSE 
BUILDINGS ARE OFTEN

[Captioner] 19:55:05
 A STAIRCASE, 
NOT SOMETHING THAT SOMEONE IS 
GOING TO BE LOOK

[Captioner] 19:55:08
ING OUT FROM.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   ON 
THE ADJACENT

[Captioner] 19:55:11
 ARGYLE PROPERTY 
SEEMS LIKE THEY ARE SET BACK 
THERE.

[Captioner] 19:55:14

>> THAT'S CORRECT.
THEY DO HAVE TREES ALONG THAT 


[Captioner] 19:55:18
PERIMETER TO HELP SET IT BACK OR 
HELP SCREEN IT BUT THERE IS A

[Captioner] 19:55:20
 
PRETTY LARGE SET BACK BETWEEN 
THE BUILDINGS.


[Captioner] 19:55:23
>> Commissioner Daulton:   AND 
HOW FAR IS THIS PROJECT FROM THE 
TRAIN

[Captioner] 19:55:26
 STATION?
>> IT'S TWO BLOCKS.

[Captioner] 19:55:30

IT'S ONE BLOCK TO -- UP CENTRAL

[Captioner] 19:55:35
 
TO THE -- TO FREMONT BOULEVARD 
AND THEN ALONG

[Captioner] 19:55:38
 FREMONT BOULEVARD 
PAST THE SILICON

[Captioner] 19:55:41
 SAGE SITE TO 
THE TRAIN STATION

[Captioner] 19:55:44
.
SO IT'S I BELIEVE ABOUT AN 
EIGHT-MINUTE WALK

[Captioner] 19:55:47
.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   OKAY.

[Captioner] 19:55:50

OKAY, ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS, 
COMMISSIONERS

[Captioner] 19:55:54
?
IN THAT CASE, DO WE HAVE AN 
APPLICANT TO GIVE A PRESENTATION

[Captioner] 19:55:57
 
ON THIS?


[Captioner] 19:56:07
>> GOOD EVENING, COMMISSIONERS,

 TOWN 
HOME PROJECTS AND THERE ARE UP

[Captioner] 20:02:31

UPCOMING MULTIFAMILY PROJECTS 
ALSO

[Captioner] 20:02:35
 IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.
THAT DEFINITELY DRAWS 
INSPIRATION

[Captioner] 20:02:38
 OF DESIGN OF THIS 
PROJECT USING

[Captioner] 20:02:42
 THE SIGNIFICANTLY 
SEEN MATERIALS AND DESIGN STYLES 
IN THE

[Captioner] 20:02:46
 NEIGHBORHOOD AS YOU CAN 
SEE FOR 41

 AVENUE RIGHT IN THE 
NEIGHBORHOOD OF THE PROPOSED 
PROJECT.


[Captioner] 20:03:02
TALKING ABOUT THE PROJECT 
FEATURES, THE PROJECT HAS

[Captioner] 20:03:05
 A 
CENTRALIZED BICYCLE PARKING 
PROPOSED RIGHT HERE

[Captioner] 20:03:08
, WHICH 
BECOMES A BIKER'S

[Captioner] 20:03:11
 HEAVEN TO BE 
ABLE TO ACCESS IT EASILY THROUGH 
BOTH

[Captioner] 20:03:15
 THE SIDES,

[Captioner] 20:03:18
 

[Captioner] 20:03:22
, EV

[Captioner] 20:03:26
 EV CHARGING, 
100% ELECTRIC AND ALSO WE ARE 
BUILDING

[Captioner] 20:03:29
 THIS PROJECT WITH 
STEEL, THIS WILL ADD MORE TO 
THIS POINT

[Captioner] 20:03:32
 OF SUSTAINABILITY AND 
FOSTER CONSTRUCTION IN THE TIME 
TO COME.


[Captioner] 20:03:38
TALKING MORE ABOUT THE PROJECT 
FEATURES,

[Captioner] 20:03:42
 THIS HOUSES A TUSCAN 
ARCHITECTURE, THE

[Captioner] 20:03:46
 LEVEL 2 AND 3 
ARE ALL

[Captioner] 20:03:49
 OFFSETTED FROM LEVEL 1, 
TO GIVE

[Captioner] 20:03:52
 A BEAUTIFUL LOOKING LOOK 
AS WELL AS THIS REDUCES

[Captioner] 20:03:55
 THE BULK 
AND MASS.
THE VARIATION IN THE

[Captioner] 20:03:59
 MATERIALS 
GIVES A SENSE OF A BEAUTIFUL 
STREETSCAPE ON THE

[Captioner] 20:04:01
 CENTRAL 
AVENUE SITE.
WE HAVE USED MORE THAN ONE 


[Captioner] 20:04:05
MATERIAL HERE IN THE FACADE THAT 
IS STUCCO

[Captioner] 20:04:08
 AND STONE COMBINATION 
AND ALSO THE UNITS HAVE STREET 
FACE

[Captioner] 20:04:11
ING ENTRANCES GIVING IT A 
MORE VIBRANT LOOK.


[Captioner] 20:04:17
THE BUILDINGS HAVE 
DIFFERENTIATED THE

[Captioner] 20:04:21
 DIFFERENT 
COLORS, AS CAN YOU SEE MORE

[Captioner] 20:04:24
 
COLOR VARIATION ADDED, THIS IS 
THE GREAT POINT OF THIS 


[Captioner] 20:04:28
ARCHITECTURE OF ADDING NEW 
STREET TREES ALONG

[Captioner] 20:04:31
 THE ARGYLE 
ROAD, 22 FEET BY DRIVING

[Captioner] 20:04:34
.
WE HAVE COVERED ENTRANCE

[Captioner] 20:04:37
 HERE AS 
FOR REQUIREMENTS, WE HAVE 
PROVIDED MORE THAN

[Captioner] 20:04:40
 WAS REQUIRED 
FOR EACH OF THESE UNITS.
ALSO THE PRIVATE OPEN SPACE 


[Captioner] 20:04:43
WHICH IS A 60 FEET, 60 SQUARE

[Captioner] 20:04:46
 
FEET REQUIREMENT, WE HAVE 
EXCEEDED THE REQUIREMENT FOR 


[Captioner] 20:04:50
EVERY UNIT HERE, AS YOU CAN SEE 
IT IS DISCOVERED AND THE 
RESIDENTS

[Captioner] 20:04:53
 CAN ENJOY THE AT ALL 
PRIVATE TIME.


[Captioner] 20:04:57
THE PROJECTS ALSO FEATURES 
SPACIOUS TWO CAR

[Captioner] 20:05:00
 GARAGES, IT 
ALSO HAS BICYCLE STORAGE INSIDE 
IT

[Captioner] 20:05:03
.
THIS IS A TYPICAL PLAN OF THE 
GARAGE,

[Captioner] 20:05:06
 THE EV CHARGING POINT IS 
ALSO PROVIDED

[Captioner] 20:05:10
 HENCE THE PROJECT 
IS ALSO FUTURE-READY WITH 100

[Captioner] 20:05:14
 
CUBE ICT FEET OF STORAGE, 
BICYCLE STORAGE

[Captioner] 20:05:17
 AND STORAGE 
SPACE FOR LARGE TRASH BINS

[Captioner] 20:05:20
.
THIS IS THE MATERIAL SCHEDULE 
AND WE

[Captioner] 20:05:24
 HAVE USED BEST QUALITY 
HIGH QUALITY MATERIALS TO BE 
PROVIDED

[Captioner] 20:05:27
 IN THIS PROJECT.
TALKING ABOUT

[Captioner] 20:05:30
 THE PRIVACY 
DIAGRAM, AS YOU CAN SEE,

[Captioner] 20:05:34
 AS 
JAMES ALSO ALREADY MENTIONED

[Captioner] 20:05:37
, 18 
FEET OF DISTANCE

[Captioner] 20:05:40
 FROM THE 
NEIGHBORS OF THE PROJECT AND 
OVER 45 FEET DISTANCE

[Captioner] 20:05:43
 FROM THE 
NEIGHBORING SINGLE FAMILY 
RESIDENCES AND

[Captioner] 20:05:47
 WE HAVE PLACED IT 
SUCH A WAY

[Captioner] 20:05:50
 THAT PLACED TOWARDS 
IT AND THE WINDOWS ARE STAGGERED

[Captioner] 20:05:53
 
FROM THE WINDOWS OF THE 
NEIGHBORING HOUSES.


[Captioner] 20:05:56
IN ADDITION TO WHICH WE HAVE 
PROVIDED PRIVACY SCREENING 
TREES,

[Captioner] 20:05:59
 THESE TREES ARE ACTUALLY

[Captioner] 20:06:02
 

[Captioner] 20:06:06
 
EVERGREEN TREES, CAN GROW UP TO 
25 TO

[Captioner] 20:06:09
 30 FEET IN HEIGHT.

[Captioner] 20:06:13

>> Trish Cordova:   EXCUSE ME, 
YOU HAVE ONE MINUTE LEFT.

[Captioner] 20:06:15

>> SURE.
I'LL GO THROUGH LAST POINTS.


[Captioner] 20:06:18
THIS IS ANOTHER REPRESENTATION 
OF THE

[Captioner] 20:06:21
 PRIVACY ASPECT BECAUSE OF 
THE TREES, THERE IS NO 
SIGNIFICANT INTRUSION

[Captioner] 20:06:25
 OF PRIVACY 
HERE.
AND THIS WILL

[Captioner] 20:06:29
 ALSO BLOCK ANY 
KIND OF CONCERNS WITH RESPECT TO 
NEIGHBORS

[Captioner] 20:06:32
.
THIS IS THE LANDSCAPING DIAGRAM 
AND WE HAVE INTRODUCED A

[Captioner] 20:06:35
 LOT OF 
EFFICIENT LANDSCAPING PATTERNS

[Captioner] 20:06:38
 
IN THE PROJECT.


[Captioner] 20:06:41
WE ALSO DID NEIGHBORHOOD 
OUTREACH STARTING SEPTEMBER 
1st WHEN

[Captioner] 20:06:45
 THE LETTERS WERE 
SENT, ON

[Captioner] 20:06:48
 SEPTEMBER 9th WE HAD 
A COMMUNITY MEETING ON THE SITE

[Captioner] 20:06:51
 
AND MET SEVERAL

[Captioner] 20:06:54
 NEIGHBORS.
ON NOVEMBER 4th THE LETTERS

[Captioner] 20:06:58
 
WERE SENT TO 226 NEIGHBORS ONCE 
AGAIN SEEKING

[Captioner] 20:07:01
 THEIR SUPPORT.
ON NOVEMBER 11th WE HAD A

[Captioner] 20:07:03
 ROAD 
SHOW MEETING TO DISCUSS ANY 
INCIDENTS.


[Captioner] 20:07:06
WE WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE 
NEIGHBORS FOR SUPPORT AND SOME

[Captioner] 20:07:10
 
OF THE IMAGES ARE HERE, 
COMMUNICATIONS ARE ALREADY WITH 


[Captioner] 20:07:13
YOU.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
I REQUEST THE HONORABLE

[Captioner] 20:07:17
 
COMMISSION TO APPROVE THE

[Captioner] 20:07:20
 
PROJECT AS RECOMMENDED BY STAFF.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   THANK 


[Captioner] 20:07:24
YOU.
COMMISSIONERS DO YOU HAVE ANY 
QUESTIONS FOR THE APPLICANT?

[Captioner] 20:07:27

MR.

[Captioner] 20:07:30
 YEE, PLEASE.
>> Commissioner Yee:   THANK YOU 
CHAIR DAULTON.


[Captioner] 20:07:33
I HAD A CHANCE TO SPEAK WITH THE 
NEIGHBOR THAT'S RIGHT NEXT TO

[Captioner] 20:07:36
 
THIS PROJECT ON ARGYLE ROAD AND

[Captioner] 20:07:40
 
IT LOOKS LIKE BASED ON THE 
ARTISTS RENDITION

[Captioner] 20:07:43
S YOU'RE GOING 
TO BE REMOVING WHAT LOOKS LIKE

[Captioner] 20:07:46
 A 
LARGE OLEANDER BUSH AND WHAT 
LOOKS LIKE

[Captioner] 20:07:49
 A PALM TREE VARIATION 
THAT, YOU KNOW, ABUTS

[Captioner] 20:07:53
 AGAINST 
THIS NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOR'S 
PROPERTY.


[Captioner] 20:07:56
SO I JUST WANTED TO DOUBLY CHECK 
AND MAKE SURE,

[Captioner] 20:07:59
 ARE THOSE TWO 
LARGE PLANTS GOING TO BE REMOVED 
AND THEN

[Captioner] 20:08:02
 REPLACED WITH SOMETHING 
ELSE?
THE REASON WHY I ASKED IS

[Captioner] 20:08:05
 THAT 
THE RESIDENT ON ARGYLE HAS BEEN 
I

[Captioner] 20:08:09
 GUESS AT ODDS ABOUT TRYING TO 
MAINTAIN THOSE TWO

[Captioner] 20:08:13
 LARGE PLANTS 
ON HER OWN.
AND I'M JUST WANTING TO

[Captioner] 20:08:16
 MAKE 
SURE THAT IF THEY ARE BEING 
REMOVED

[Captioner] 20:08:19
 THAT, YOU KNOW, WHAT IS 
PUT BACK INTO PLACE BECOMES

[Captioner] 20:08:22
 A 
LOT MORE MAINTENANCE-FREE FOR

[Captioner] 20:08:25
 
THIS RESIDENCE.
>> OF COURSE, WE ARE

[Captioner] 20:08:29
 SAVING THE 
STREET TREES AND THE PROTECTED 
TREE

[Captioner] 20:08:32
 THAT'S ON ARGYLE ROAD.
OTHER TREES WHICH ARE

[Captioner] 20:08:37
 
RECOMMENDED REMOVAL BY THE 
ARBORIST ARE REMOVED.

[Captioner] 20:08:40

WE HAVE ALREADY REPLACEMENT OF 
TREES TO THE CITY

[Captioner] 20:08:44
, HENCE ALL THE 
REPLACEMENT THE 24

[Captioner] 20:08:47
 INCH BOX 
TREES HAVE BEEN ALREADY TAKEN 
CARE OF AS

[Captioner] 20:08:50
 CAN YOU SEE THE 
LANDSCAPING DIAGRAM.
THAT WILL

[Captioner] 20:08:54
 BE BRIEFLY FOR THE 
NEIGHBOR.
>> Commissioner Yee:   OKAY, I

[Captioner] 20:08:57
 
ALSO HAVE ONE MORE QUESTION WITH 
RELATIONSHIP TO THAT ONE

[Captioner] 20:09:00
 
RESIDENT.
IT LOOKS LIKE ON YOUR ARTIST

[Captioner] 20:09:03
 
RENDITIONS AGAIN, THERE IS 
CURRENTLY RIGHT NOW WHAT

[Captioner] 20:09:06
 LOOKS 
LIKE AN IRON FENCE THAT IS 
DIVIDING THE TWO

[Captioner] 20:09:10
 PROPERTIES, 
RIGHT NOW, THAT GOES ALL THE WAY 
TO THE SIDEWALK

[Captioner] 20:09:13
.
THAT LOOKS LIKE, AND YOUR ARTIST 
RENDITION

[Captioner] 20:09:16
 AND CORRECT ME IF I'M 
WRONG IT'S GOING TO BE REPLACED 
WITH WHAT LOOKS LIKE

[Captioner] 20:09:19
 A WOODEN 
FENCE THAT GOES ALL THE WAY TO 
THE SIDEWALK

[Captioner] 20:09:22
 AGO WELL?
>> THE FENCING HERE WILL ONLY BE 
ON THE

[Captioner] 20:09:26
 TWO SIDES.
THAT IS THE REAR AND THE SIDE OF 
THE

[Captioner] 20:09:29
 SINGLE FAMILY HOMES, REST WE 
HAVE

[Captioner] 20:09:32
 NOT PROVIDED ANY FENCING

[Captioner] 20:09:35
 
TOWARDS THE STREET SIDE.
IT IS OPEN MORE VISUAL

[Captioner] 20:09:39
LY 
INTEGRATING INTO THE STREET.


[Captioner] 20:09:44
SO AND THE HIGH INTENSITY WOULD 
BE GONE

[Captioner] 20:09:47
.
>> Commissioner Yee:   OKAY, 
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:09:49
>> THANK YOU.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   ANY 
OTHER QUESTIONS FROM 


[Captioner] 20:09:52
COMMISSIONERS TO THE APPLICANT?
YES,

[Captioner] 20:09:55
 CHARLES LIU PLEASE.


[Captioner] 20:10:00
>> Commissioner Liu:   LOOKS 
LIKE THE CONDITION OF THE JOB 
SITE

[Captioner] 20:10:03
 HAS DETERIORATED 
SIGNIFICANTLY FROM ABOUT A YEAR 
AND A HALF AGO

[Captioner] 20:10:06
 WHEN I HAPPENED 
TO STOP BY THE AREA

[Captioner] 20:10:09
.
WHAT -- ONE OF THE HOUSES 
APPEARED

[Captioner] 20:10:13
 TO BE SEVERELY BURNED 
FROM THE NIGHT

[Captioner] 20:10:16
 INSIDE.
AND WHAT

[Captioner] 20:10:20
 ADDITIONAL MEASURES DID 
YOU MAKE OTHER THAN PUTTING UP 
THE FENCES

[Captioner] 20:10:23
 TO PREVENT IT FROM 
DETERIORATING EVEN

[Captioner] 20:10:26
 FURTHER?

[Captioner] 20:10:30

>> THANK YOU NOR THE QUESTION 
COMMISSIONER.


[Captioner] 20:10:33
THE PROJECT AS YOU

[Captioner] 20:10:36
 INDICATED, 
ONE AND A HALF YEARS AGO,

[Captioner] 20:10:39
 ONCE 
IT WAS VACATED WE PLACED THE 
FENCES AFTER WHICH

[Captioner] 20:10:42
 WE ALSO 
PLACED A CCTV CAMERAS

[Captioner] 20:10:45
.
HOWEVER THERE WAS FREQUENT BREAK 
INS.


[Captioner] 20:10:48
WE ALSO HAD SECURITY PERSON 
FREQUENTLY VISIT

[Captioner] 20:10:51
ING THE SITE TO 
MAINTAIN THERE WAS

[Captioner] 20:10:54
 NO 
TRESPASSING.
HOWEVER THAT PROGRESSED BY

[Captioner] 20:10:58
 THEIR 
CUTTING THE FENCE AND THEY WERE 
YOU KNOW FOUND

[Captioner] 20:11:01
 TO DO SOME 
ACTIVITIES NOT PERMITTED OF 
COURSE AND HENCE WE

[Captioner] 20:11:04
 HAD CALLED 
IN THE CHIEF OF POLICE

[Captioner] 20:11:08
 OF THE 
CITY OF FREMONT AND THE PEOPLE 
WERE VACATED FROM THE PROPERTY

[Captioner] 20:11:11
 
TIME AND AGAIN, THE TIME FROM 
LAST YEAR SEPTEMBER

[Captioner] 20:11:14
 2021.
SINCE THEN THERE WAS NOT MUCH OF

[Captioner] 20:11:17
 
AN ACTIVITY UNTIL THE MONTH

[Captioner] 20:11:21
 OF 
AUGUST, YEAR AGAIN THIS YEAR 
WHEN

[Captioner] 20:11:25
 A FEW MISCREANT

[Captioner] 20:11:29
S WENT INTO 
THE PROPERTY AND SET FIRE

[Captioner] 20:11:32
 OF THE 
BROOM AND A REPORT WAS MADE OF 
THAT INCIDENT

[Captioner] 20:11:35
 WHICH TRIGGERED 
FIRE ON THE PROPERTY AT NIGHT.
IT WAS IN THE

[Captioner] 20:11:39
 MIDNIGHT AND SOON 
THE FIRE TENDERS

[Captioner] 20:11:42
 RUSHED TO DOUSE 
IT.


[Captioner] 20:11:46
WE ONCE AGAIN TIGHTENED SECURITY 
AROUND ALL THE FENCE

[Captioner] 20:11:49
S, WE 
STARTED ALL THE CCT

[Captioner] 20:11:52
V CAMERAS, 
ENSURED TREK VISITS TO MAKE SURE

[Captioner] 20:11:55
 
THERE WAS NO TRESPASSING.
THE

[Captioner] 20:11:59
 CENTRAL CORE WE UNDERSTAND 
ONCE

[Captioner] 20:12:02
 AGAIN A PERSON HAS BARGED 
INTO THE PROPERTY.
WE GOT THE

[Captioner] 20:12:05
 PERSON OUT AND GOT 
THE INFORMATION FROM THE

[Captioner] 20:12:08
 CITY 
POLICE REPRESENTATIVE THAT YES, 
THAT TEAM

[Captioner] 20:12:11
 HAS REACHING THE SPOT 
TO GET THE

[Captioner] 20:12:14
 HOMELESS PERSON OUT 
OF THE PROPERTY.
SO THAT HAS BEEN

[Captioner] 20:12:17
 TREK BECAUSE WE 
KNOW FREMONT CITY HAS

[Captioner] 20:12:20
 ONE OF THE 
HIGHEST NUMBER OF HOMELESS AND 
WE ARE CONSTANTLY TRYING

[Captioner] 20:12:23
 TO 
SECURE THE PROPERTY.


[Captioner] 20:12:27
>> Commissioner Liu:   THANK 
YOU.
>> THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 20:12:30

>> Commissioner Daulton:   
COMMISSIONER BASRAI.


[Captioner] 20:12:33
>> Commissioner Basrai:   COUPLE 
OF THINGS I'D LIKE TO ADD TO 
COMMISSIONER LIU

[Captioner] 20:12:36
'S STATEMENT.
THERE ARE A TON OF CARS PARKED

[Captioner] 20:12:40
 
THERE ILLEGALLY.
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING TO

[Captioner] 20:12:43
 MAKE 
SURE, BECAUSE IT BASICALLY LOOKS 
LIKE A PARK

[Captioner] 20:12:46
ING LOT WITH BOTH OF 
THE GARAGES -- AND YOU KNOW LIKE

[Captioner] 20:12:49
 
I SAID I DISCLOSE THIS, I LIVED 
THERE,

[Captioner] 20:12:52
 I LIVED ON THAT HOUSE AT

[Captioner] 20:12:56
  
4158 CENTRAL

[Captioner] 20:13:01
.
THEY HAVE DONE A LOT OF 
CONSTRUCTION I KNOW

[Captioner] 20:13:04
 WHY THEY ARE 
THERE.
THERE ARE A LOT OF CARS, THEY 


[Captioner] 20:13:07
KEEP BREAKING INTO THE THE 
FENCE.
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS GOING TO DO TO

[Captioner] 20:13:11
 
EITHER DEMOLISH THE STRUCTURE SO 
THIS DOESN'T KEEP

[Captioner] 20:13:14
 HAPPENING?
BECAUSE THERE ARE -- IT LOOKS 
LIKE AN ABANDONED

[Captioner] 20:13:18
 CAR LOT.
AND THEN THE ONLY OTHER LAST 
THING IS I WOULD LIKE

[Captioner] 20:13:21
 TO -- SO 
THERE'S TWO QUESTIONS -- IS JUST 
KNOWING

[Captioner] 20:13:24
 THAT NEIGHBORHOOD AND 
LIVING IN THAT NEIGHBORHOOD FOR 
SO MANY YEARS, YOU KNOW,

[Captioner] 20:13:27
 WHY 
THERE WASN'T ANY SORT OF 
DISCUSSION ON SOME SORT

[Captioner] 20:13:31
 OF 
LOW-INCOME -- I KNOW THE DESIGN 
MAYBE

[Captioner] 20:13:34
 NOT ACCEPTED FOR IT, BUT 
ANY SORT OF, YOU KNOW, LOOK

[Captioner] 20:13:38
ING 
OR MORE THAN JUST TAKING

[Captioner] 20:13:41
 THE 
EXEMPTION, LOOKING AT, YOU KNOW, 
THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND LOOK

[Captioner] 20:13:44
ING AT 
ALL THOSE APARTMENT COMPLEXES 
AND THE SINGLE

[Captioner] 20:13:47
 FAMILY HOMES AND 
THE TOWN HOUSES THERE,

[Captioner] 20:13:50
 WHY THAT 
THIS COULDN'T BE AN

[Captioner] 20:13:54
 EXAMPLE OF 
WHERE WE COULD HAVE BOTH.
BECAUSE I

[Captioner] 20:13:57
 THINK THAT -- THAT 
NEIGHBORHOOD, ESPECIALLY

[Captioner] 20:14:00
 THE 
KIDS THAT WALKED FROM 
CENTERVILLE AND COME

[Captioner] 20:14:04
 FROM 
SCHOOL, AND THEY LIVE AND THEIR 
PARENTS WORK

[Captioner] 20:14:07
 THERE, THAT WE CAN 
KIND OF TRY TO MAKE

[Captioner] 20:14:10
 THAT AN 
EXAMPLE.
THOSE ARE MY TWO POINTS

[Captioner] 20:14:13
, WHAT 
ARE WE GOING TO DO ABOUT THE 
CARS AND MAKE SURE

[Captioner] 20:14:16
 THE FENCING 
STAYS UP AND IS THERE

[Captioner] 20:14:20
 ANYTHING 
WE CAN DO ON THE WALL IN COMING 
SIDE

[Captioner] 20:14:23
?
>> I APPRECIATE YOUR STATING

[Captioner] 20:14:26
 
THAT YOU HAVE BEEN A FORMER 
RESIDENT ON THE PROPERTY.


[Captioner] 20:14:29
WE HAVE OF COURSE THE PLANNER 
CAN SECOND THAT, WE HAVE

[Captioner] 20:14:32
 A DEMO 
PERMIT OF THE CITY.

[Captioner] 20:14:36

WE BELIEVE DEMOING THESE 
PROPERTIES CAN CLEAR

[Captioner] 20:14:39
 UP THESE 
INCIDENTS THAT MAY POTENTIALLY 
COME UP.


[Captioner] 20:14:42
THAT APPLICATION IS ALREADY 
THERE AND IT IS IN THE PROCESS 
AND

[Captioner] 20:14:46
 WE DEFINITELY INTEND TO GET 
IT.
THE FIRE

[Captioner] 20:14:49
 WAS BACK AND FORTH WITH 
THE INSURANCE COMPANY ON THE

[Captioner] 20:14:53
 ROT 
CONDITION FOR WHICH THIS

[Captioner] 20:14:56
 WAS 
ANSWERING, BUT WE ARE COMPLETELY 
FOCUSED

[Captioner] 20:14:59
 ABOUT GETTING RID OF 
THIS DILAPIDATED STRUCTURE

[Captioner] 20:15:02
 AND 
ENSURING A SAFE NEIGHBORHOOD AND 
BASICALLY TRYING TO

[Captioner] 20:15:05
 PROVIDE AS 
YOU SAID, REMOVE ALL THESE

[Captioner] 20:15:09
 CARS 
AND GETTING A TOWING

[Captioner] 20:15:11
 PERMIT AND 
GET THEM REMOVED FROM THE 
PROPERTY.


[Captioner] 20:15:14
SO THAT IS I GUESS

[Captioner] 20:15:17
 A BIT OF 
RESPECT TO THE DEMOLITION PERMIT 
AND TO ENSURE

[Captioner] 20:15:21
 THAT THE SITE IS 
CLEAN

[Captioner] 20:15:24
.
THIS BMR AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNIT

[Captioner] 20:15:27

UNIT, WE DID HAVE A DISCUSSION 
WITH THE PLANNERS ON IF THERE'S

[Captioner] 20:15:29
 
ANY QUIERNLT.
WE ARE NOT SEEKING ANY 


[Captioner] 20:15:33
EXEMPTIONS OR VARIATIONS IN THIS 
PROJECT AT ALL.

[Captioner] 20:15:36

AND AS FOR THE CALCULATIONS FOR 
BMR UNIT

[Captioner] 20:15:39
 WE CAN ONLY PAY IN LIEU 
FEES AND THAT'S

[Captioner] 20:15:43
 NOT REQUIRED TO 
PROVIDE A UNIT ALTOGETHER AND

[Captioner] 20:15:46
 
HENCE WE'RE HAPPY TO PAY THAT 
FOR

[Captioner] 20:15:50
 THE

[Captioner] 20:15:54
 IN LIEU FEES.
>> Commissioner Basrai:   THANK 
YOU

[Captioner] 20:15:56

>> Commissioner Daulton:   IF 


[Captioner] 20:16:02
THERE ARE NO OTHER QUESTIONS FOR 
THE APPLICANT FROM THE 
COMMISSIONERS I WOULD LIKE

[Captioner] 20:16:47
 THAT 
APPLICANT TALKED ABOUT AND ALSO 
THE QUESTION

[Captioner] 20:16:51
 THAT MR. LI

[Captioner] 20:16:54
 LIU ASKED, 
THE

[Captioner] 20:16:58
 PROPERTY IS IN BAD SHAPE AND 
AS WE SPEAK,

[Captioner] 20:17:01
 THERE IS SOMEBODY 
LIVING THE NOW.
OTHER HOMELESS PEOPLE

[Captioner] 20:17:04
 WITH THEM, 
AND THEY ARE A NUISANCE, THAT'S

[Captioner] 20:17:06
 
ONE.
AND THE SECOND IS, WE WOULD 


[Captioner] 20:17:10
REALLY APPRECIATE IF YOU JUST 
KEEP IT CLEAN.
IF YOU JUST KEEP

[Captioner] 20:17:14
 THE PRIME 
PORTION OF IT CLEAN.
BECAUSE IT LOOKS SO

[Captioner] 20:17:17
 DIRTY, EVERY 
TIME WE GET GUESTS THEY TALK 
ABOUT THAT PROPERTY

[Captioner] 20:17:20
.
SO LIKE WE WOULD WANT TO HAVE 
YOU GUYS DEVELOPING

[Captioner] 20:17:23
 THAT AND WE 
WOULD WANT YOU TO WELCOME TO 
THIS

[Captioner] 20:17:26
 COMMUNITY.
BUT WHAT HAS HAPPENED SO FAR IS

[Captioner] 20:17:30
, 
THEY'RE JUST LIKE A REALLY BAD 
TATE IN

[Captioner] 20:17:33
 OUR OWN MOUTH.
SO PLEASE,

[Captioner] 20:17:37
 YOU SHOWED THE ROAD 
MAP HOW YOU GOT HERE SO FAR

[Captioner] 20:17:40
 BUT 
WHAT I DID NOT SEE IS WHAT ARE 
YOU GOING TO

[Captioner] 20:17:43
 DO NEXT.
SO PLEASE START WORKING ON IT

[Captioner] 20:17:46
 AS 
SOON AS POSSIBLE AND DEMOLISH 
THAT PROPERTY, IF YOU ARE GOING

[Captioner] 20:17:49
 
TO TAKE SOME TIME OREBUILD IT, 
IT'S IN REALLY BAD

[Captioner] 20:17:52
 SHAPE AND 
BRINGING A LOT OF REALLY BAD 
PEOPLE HERE.


[Captioner] 20:17:54
THANK YOU.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   THANK 
YOU SIR.


[Captioner] 20:17:57
TRISH DO WE HAVE MORE SPEAKERS?
>> Trish Cordova:   YES, LET

[Captioner] 20:18:01
 ME 
INTRODUCE THE NEXT SPEAKER, 
DONNA

[Captioner] 20:18:05
 ALVAREZ, GO AHEAD AND 
SPEAK, YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES.


[Captioner] 20:18:11
DONNA, GO AHEAD AND SPEAKS.
YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES.

[Captioner] 20:18:14

>> YES.
I HAVE THREE QUESTIONS.

[Captioner] 20:18:17

THE FIRST ONE IS, I BRIEFLY 
HEARD THAT YOU SAID

[Captioner] 20:18:21
 YOU WERE 
GOING TO TAKE THE

[Captioner] 20:18:25
 EXISTING 
SHRUBBERY OUT.
SO

[Captioner] 20:18:29
 THAT IT WOULD NOT OVERFLOW ON 
MY PROPERTY

[Captioner] 20:18:32
.
BECAUSE I'VE HAD A GARDENER TO 
KEEP THAT

[Captioner] 20:18:35
 BACK.
BECAUSE THE CITY, I

[Captioner] 20:18:39
 SPOKE TO THE 
CITY, THEY SAID THAT WAS

[Captioner] 20:18:42
 MY 
PROBLEM.
AND SECOND QUESTION

[Captioner] 20:18:46
 IS,

[Captioner] 20:18:49
 THE 
PERSON THAT LIVED THERE FOR, I 
DON'T KNOW

[Captioner] 20:18:52
, TEN YEARS OR MORE, 
THAT HAD THE PROPERTY

[Captioner] 20:18:56
, THERE IS 
A LOT OF TRAFFIC THERE.

[Captioner] 20:19:00

AND WOULD THE PARKING SPACES 
THAT YOU'RE ALLOWING FOR

[Captioner] 20:19:04
 AND 
THEN FIVE EXTRA SPACES, I DON'T 
KNOW THAT

[Captioner] 20:19:07
 THAT'S ENOUGH FOR THAT 
AREA.
WE GET AN

[Captioner] 20:19:10
 OVERFLOW OF TRAFFIC 
ALL THE TIME

[Captioner] 20:19:13
.
CONSTANTLY.

[Captioner] 20:19:18

AND MY THIRD QUESTION IS

[Captioner] 20:19:21
:  THE 
PROPERTY HAS BEEN THAT WAY

[Captioner] 20:19:24
 FOR 
SEVERAL YEARS NOW.
AND AS YOU KNOW

[Captioner] 20:19:28
, I'M RIGHT NEXT 
DOOR TO THAT

[Captioner] 20:19:31
 PROPERTY, AND I 
HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYONE COME

[Captioner] 20:19:34
 OUT 
THERE TO HANDLE THE

[Captioner] 20:19:37
 SITUATION.
I DID SEE THE FENCE.
AND THEN

[Captioner] 20:19:41
 I SAW NOTHING AFTER 
THAT.
NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES I 


[Captioner] 20:19:45
CONTACTED THE CITY.

[Captioner] 20:19:48

AND WE HAD A PROBLEM WITH RATS 
AND ROACHES.


[Captioner] 20:19:55
SO I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING 
TO BE DONE ABOUT THAT.

[Captioner] 20:19:58

THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 20:20:01

>> Commissioner Daulton:   THANK 
YOU, MS. 

[Captioner] 20:20:05
ALVAREZ.
TRISH I SEE WE HAVE

[Captioner] 20:20:07
 ANOTHER 
SPEAKER.
>> Trish Cordova:   I'LL GO 


[Captioner] 20:20:10
AHEAD OKAY YES.
SO THE NEXT SPEAKER IS KELLY A

[Captioner] 20:20:13
.
KELLY, GO AHEAD AND SPEAK.
YOU HAVE PERMISSION.


[Captioner] 20:20:16
YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES.
>> YES, FIRST PROBLEM WAS THE

[Captioner] 20:20:19
 
OVERFLOW PARKING NOW AND IT WAS 
CONSTANTLY.


[Captioner] 20:20:22
SO I BELIEVE THESE PEOPLE, SO 
THAT'S PROBABLY LIKE

[Captioner] 20:20:25
 AT 
MIDNIGHT, 3 A.M., 3 P.M,

[Captioner] 20:20:28
 ALL 
AROUND THE CLOCK.
THERE'S WAY TOO MANY CARS IN 


[Captioner] 20:20:31
THIS NEIGHBORHOOD.
NOW IF THIS WERE, YOU KNOW,

[Captioner] 20:20:35
 A 
MORE PRIVILEGED NEIGHBORHOOD

[Captioner] 20:20:38
 
LIKE MISSION PEAK STANFORD

[Captioner] 20:20:41
 
AFTERNOON MISSION SAN JOSE WE 
WOULD GET IN WHAT, THOSE PARKING

[Captioner] 20:20:44
 
PERMITS AND THE POLICE WOULD BE 
OUT THERE HIRING

[Captioner] 20:20:47
 EXTRA HEAD 
COUNTS AND HANDING OUT

[Captioner] 20:20:51
 
RESIDENTIAL TICKETS, THESE 
PEOPLE HAVE A REAL PROBLEM AND 


[Captioner] 20:20:54
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO GET ANY 
HELP FROM THE CITY SO I PROMISE 
YOU, YOUR

[Captioner] 20:20:58
 LIFE IS GOING TO BE 
HELL.
YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO GET THOSE

[Captioner] 20:21:01
 
PARKING PERMITS.
ALL BUT RESOURCE

[Captioner] 20:21:04
S GOES TO 
MISSION SAN JOSE.
200 FEET NORTHWEST OF THIS 


[Captioner] 20:21:07
THERE'S A GIANT

[Captioner] 20:21:10
 EMPTY LOT.
IF THIS WAS MISSION SAN JOSE 
PEOPLE WOULD NOTICE

[Captioner] 20:21:13
 THAT THERE 
ARE HUNDREDS OF TRUCKLOADS OF 
DIRT, DOZENS

[Captioner] 20:21:18
 OF TRUCKLOADS OF 
DIRT GETTING DUMPED

[Captioner] 20:21:21
 ON TO THIS 
EMPTY LOT.


[Captioner] 20:21:24
WHY DO YOU LET PEOPLE DUMP

[Captioner] 20:21:27
 DIRT 
ON THIS LOT?
THAT'S A PROFITABLE THING

[Captioner] 20:21:30
 YOU 
KNOW, YOU DON'T KNOW THE 
TOXICITY OF THAT DIRT

[Captioner] 20:21:33
.
SOMEBODY SHOULD BE FIGURING THIS 
OUT BUT I'M SURE THE

[Captioner] 20:21:36
 CITY IS NOT 
REALLY LOOKING AT THAT EMPTY 
LOT.


[Captioner] 20:21:39
THEN ANOTHER POINT OF DIFFERENCE 
WITH MISSION SAN JOSE.
THERE IS A

[Captioner] 20:21:42
 7-ELEVEN ACROSS THE 
STREET.
IT IS ACTUALLY A

[Captioner] 20:21:46
LIVE AND 
WORKING, THE ONE IN MISSION SAN 
JOSE IT DIED

[Captioner] 20:21:49
, I TOLD YOU ALL THE 
BUSINESSES IN MISSION SAN JOSE 
IS DYING AND

[Captioner] 20:21:52
 THE 7-ELEVEN IS ONE 
OF THEM.
ANOTHER DIFFERENCE

[Captioner] 20:21:55
 WITH MISSION 
SAN JOSE.
THIS HOUSE HAS A PUBLIC

[Captioner] 20:21:59
 PARK, 
COMMUNITY PARK UNDER 
CONSTRUCTION, 0.

[Captioner] 20:22:02
3 MILES AWAY.
THIS NEIGHBORHOOD HAS BEEN HERE 
FOR 20 OR

[Captioner] 20:22:05
 30 OR 40 YEARS, THEY 
NEVER HAD A PARK

[Captioner] 20:22:08
.
MISSION SAN JOSE HAS LOTS OF 
PARKS.


[Captioner] 20:22:11
THIS NEIGHBORHOOD IS JUST NOW 
GETTING A PARK,

[Captioner] 20:22:14
 A COMMUNITY 
PARK, FROM THE CITY OF FREMONT

[Captioner] 20:22:17
.
WHAT A MAGNIFICENT THING AND 
IT'S

[Captioner] 20:22:20
 ONLY TAKEN WHAT?
40 YEARS?
THANK YOU

[Captioner] 20:22:22
.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   THANK 
YOU, KELLY.


[Captioner] 20:22:28
IF THAT'S ALL THE

[Captioner] 20:22:31
 SPEAKERS, I'D 
LIKE TO GIVE THE

[Captioner] 20:22:35
 APPLICANT A FEW 
MINUTES TO EITHER SUM UP,

[Captioner] 20:22:38
 OR 
REBUT SOME OF THOSE ISSUES,

[Captioner] 20:22:41
 
PLEASE.
>> SURE, THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:22:44
THANK YOU EVERYONE FOR COMING 
AND SPEAKING UP FOR ROJT

[Captioner] 20:22:47
.
SUMMARIZING THE POINTS AND 
RESPONDING TO EACH OF THEM.


[Captioner] 20:22:50
FOR THE FIRST SPEAKER,

[Captioner] 20:22:54
 WITH 
RESPECT TO DEMOLITION, THE

[Captioner] 20:22:58
 
APPLICATION IS ALREADY WITH THE 
CITY AND WE HAVE

[Captioner] 20:23:02
 COMPLETELY 
COMMITTED TO AVOID

[Captioner] 20:23:05
ING ANY SUCH 
NUISANCE.
THE

[Captioner] 20:23:10
 APPLICATION HAS BEEN OVER

[Captioner] 20:23:13
 NEARLY 
FOUR YEARS TO REACH

[Captioner] 20:23:17
 THIS LAST 
THREE AND A HALF TO FOUR YEARS 
WE HAVE SPENT AND

[Captioner] 20:23:20
 WE CONTINUE 
TO, YOU KNOW, WE DEFINITELY WANT 
TO HAVE THIS OUT

[Captioner] 20:23:24
 AND ONLY 
SOLUTION HERE I BELIEVE IS

[Captioner] 20:23:27
 FOR 
US TO APPROVAL AND GET THE 
CONSTRUCTION STARTED.


[Captioner] 20:23:30
WE ALSO HAVE CLEANING DONE, AS 
YOU SEE WE REGULARLY CLEAN

[Captioner] 20:23:33
 THE 
SIDEWALKS, WE HAVE MANY NOTICES

[Captioner] 20:23:36
 
ALSO FROM THE CITY FROM TIME TO 
TIME AND WE HAVE BEEN RESPONDING 


[Captioner] 20:23:40
TO THEM AND GETTING THIS SITE

[Captioner] 20:23:43
 
THE GRASS TRIMMED, THE SIDEWALKS 
CLEARED,

[Captioner] 20:23:46
 AND ALSO WE HAVE DONE 
IT, WITH RESPECT TO

[Captioner] 20:23:49
 THE TRAFFIC, 
OF COURSE, THIS

[Captioner] 20:23:53
 MULTIFAMILY 
PROJECT DOES HOUSE TWO CAR 
GARAGES FOR

[Captioner] 20:23:56
 EVERY UNIT, 
SUFFICIENT FOR ALL THE 
RESIDENCES,

[Captioner] 20:24:00
 AS WELL AS VISITOR 
PARKING IS PROVIDED IN THE SITE 
ITSELF

[Captioner] 20:24:03
 WHICH IS SUFFICIENT AS 
FOR ALL

[Captioner] 20:24:06
 THEN CONFORMING TO THE 
REGULATIONS AND GUIDELINES 
ITSELF, HENCE WE

[Captioner] 20:24:09
 ARE PROVIDING 
AND WE'RE NOT SEEKING ANY 
EXCEPTIONS

[Captioner] 20:24:12
 OR VARIATIONS 
PROVIDING LESS

[Captioner] 20:24:16
ER PARKINGS AT 
ALL.
ALL THE TREES

[Captioner] 20:24:20
, LANDSCAPING AGAIN 
PROVIDING ARE

[Captioner] 20:24:24
 GREEN TREES HENCE 
LESSER CONCERN ON THE

[Captioner] 20:24:27
 
LANDSCAPING FOR YOU.
FOR YOU AND THE LAST APPLICANT I 


[Captioner] 20:24:30
GUESS THE CONCERN IN RESPECT TO 
THIS IS THAT WE MOVE THE PROJECT

[Captioner] 20:24:33
 
FAST ENOUGH, GET THE PROJECT 
STARTED AND THAT IS WHEN WE

[Captioner] 20:24:37
 CAN 
ENSURE BETTER AND BEAUTIFUL 
STREETSCAPE

[Captioner] 20:24:41
.
>> Commissioner Daulton:  

[Captioner] 20:24:44
 THANK 
YOU MR. DATTA

[Captioner] 20:24:47
.
IF THERE ARE NO MORE QUESTIONS 
I'M GOING TO CLOSE THE

[Captioner] 20:24:50
 PUBLIC 
HEARING AT THIS TIME.
AND BRING IT BACK TO THE 


[Captioner] 20:24:53
COMMISSIONERS.ANY QUESTIONS OR

[Captioner] 20:24:56
 
COMMENTS FROM THE

[Captioner] 20:24:59
 COMMISSION AT 
THIS POINT PLEASE

[Captioner] 20:25:03
?

[Captioner] 20:25:06

NOBODY, OKAY.
I JUST WANT TO SAY AGAIN

[Captioner] 20:25:09
 I'M 
GOING TO ITERATE, ANY TIME YOU

[Captioner] 20:25:12
 
BRING ME A DEVELOPMENT OF TOWN 
HOUSES

[Captioner] 20:25:18
 WITHIN AN EIGHT-MINUTE 
WALK

[Captioner] 20:25:23
 TO A TRANSIT HUB, I GOT TO

[Captioner] 20:25:26
 
SAY, YOU'VE LOST THE PLOT.

[Captioner] 20:25:30

BECAUSE I REALIZE THAT THIS IS 
WHAT DEVELOPERS BRING

[Captioner] 20:25:34
 YOU AND 
PRESENT TO YOU, BECAUSE, YOU 
KNOW, OF COURSE THEY

[Captioner] 20:25:37
 WANT TO 
SELL A 2500

[Captioner] 20:25:40
 SQUARE FOOT TOWN 
HOUSE.
AND I CAN'T SAY THAT I BLAME

[Captioner] 20:25:44
 
THEM.
BUT OUR IDEA

[Captioner] 20:25:48
 OF TOD'S IS THAT

[Captioner] 20:25:52
 WE 
ALLOW PEOPLE TO ACCESS

[Captioner] 20:25:56
 THE 
TRANSIT THERE BY OFFERING DENSER 
HOUSING

[Captioner] 20:26:01
, SMALLER UNITS, LESS 
PARKING,

[Captioner] 20:26:04
 ALL THE THINGS THAT ARE 
SORT OF MISSING FROM THIS.
IN ADDITION

[Captioner] 20:26:07
, I DON'T KNOW IF 
COMMISSIONER BASRAI

[Captioner] 20:26:11
 WAS 
INTIMATING THIS OR NOT.
BUTTER THIS IS A WORKING

[Captioner] 20:26:14
 CLASS 
NEIGHBORHOOD AND HAS ALWAYS BEEN 
A WORKING CLASS NEIGHBORHOOD

[Captioner] 20:26:18
.
AND SO THE FIT HERE IS OBVIOUSLY

[Captioner] 20:26:21
 
AWKWARD OF THIS PROJECT.
AND

[Captioner] 20:26:25
 IT'S NOT GOING TO BE -- IT'S 
GOING TO BE NOTICE

[Captioner] 20:26:29
ABLE.
AGAIN, I REALIZE

[Captioner] 20:26:32
 THAT THE 
BUILDER CAN BUILD WHATEVER HE 
WANTS THERE

[Captioner] 20:26:35
 TO A CERTAIN EXTENT.

[Captioner] 20:26:39

BUT THIS IS GOING TO BE A BIT OF 
A

[Captioner] 20:26:42
 SORE THUMB.
AND I WOULD HOPE WHEN WE

[Captioner] 20:26:45
 GET A 
SORE THUMB LIKE THIS IN A 
NEIGHBORHOOD LIKE

[Captioner] 20:26:48
 THIS, IT 
OFFERS SOME OF THE

[Captioner] 20:26:51
 ASPECTS THAT 
WE'RE TRYING TO PROVIDE WITHIN 
THE T

[Captioner] 20:26:55
OD OF

[Captioner] 20:26:58
 SOME AFFORDABILITY,

[Captioner] 20:27:01
 
SOME LIMITATION ON PARKING.
I THINK CLEARLY BOTH THESE 


[Captioner] 20:27:05
PROJECTS RAISE THE ISSUE THAT WE 
NEED TO HAVE PARKING

[Captioner] 20:27:08
 MAXIMUMS IN 
THE TOD.
AND I UNDERSTAND THAT'S

[Captioner] 20:27:11
 NOT MY 
PURVIEW OR THE PURVIEW OF THIS 
ITEM RIGHT NOW

[Captioner] 20:27:14
.
BUT, YOU KNOW, IT'S AS GOOD A 
TIME AS ANY TO BRING IT

[Captioner] 20:27:18
 UP.
YES, COMMISSIONER BASRAI.

[Captioner] 20:27:22

>> Commissioner Basrai:   AND I 
THINK COMMISSIONER DAULTON, I

[Captioner] 20:27:25
 
JUST WANT TO REITERATE THAT 
MOVING FORWARD,

[Captioner] 20:27:28
 LIKE WHEN YOU 
WALK THROUGH THESE 
NEIGHBORHOODS, HAVING LIVED 


[Captioner] 20:27:32
THROUGH SOME OF THIS 
CONSTRUCTION, FROM WHAT WAS ON

[Captioner] 20:27:35
 
FREMONT BOULEVARD, AND WHAT WAS 
NEXT DOOR TO ME, JUST

[Captioner] 20:27:38
 DIDN'T 
FIT, WAS HOPING THAT WE WOULD 
SEE

[Captioner] 20:27:42
 A LITTLE BIT MORE, WHEN YOU 
SEE

[Captioner] 20:27:45
 THE KIDS WALKING DOWN THE 
STREET ON CENTRAL AVENUE

[Captioner] 20:27:48
 FROM 
CENTERVILLE ELEMENTARY, GOING 
HOME, TO

[Captioner] 20:27:52
 THEIR APARTMENT 
COMPLEXES DOWN THE STREET, IT 
WOULD BE NICE IF SOME

[Captioner] 20:27:55
 OF THEM 
COULD WALK TO THEIR HOUSES.
AND THAT JUST DOESN'T

[Captioner] 20:27:58
 FEEL LIKE 
THAT.
AND THAT -- LIKE YOU SAID,

[Captioner] 20:28:01
 I 
CAN'T -- THAT'S NOT IN OUR 
PURVIEW.


[Captioner] 20:28:04
YOU KNOW, I HAVE TO VOTE WITH 
HOW THE ZONING AND WHAT PLANNING 
SAYS

[Captioner] 20:28:08
.
BUT I REALLY DO HOPE THAT WE 
REALLY DO TAKE THAT

[Captioner] 20:28:11
 INTO 
CONSIDERATION MOVING FORWARD.
>> Commissioner Daulton: 

[Captioner] 20:28:14
  THANK 
YOU COMMISSIONER.
IF THERE ARE NO

[Captioner] 20:28:17
 OTHER COMMENTS, 
I WILL TAKE A MOTION ON THIS 
ITEM

[Captioner] 20:28:22
.
>> Planner Pullen:   I'D LIKE TO 
JUMP IN

[Captioner] 20:28:25
 HERE COMMISSIONER AND 
JUST SPEAK TO THIS.
BECAUSE IT HAS

[Captioner] 20:28:29
 COME UP.
I THINK IT CAME UP ON THE ITEM 
WE

[Captioner] 20:28:32
 HAD ON ROBERTS

[Captioner] 20:28:35
 LAST AGENDA 
AND IT CAME UP HERE.
WE HAVE A

[Captioner] 20:28:38
 LOT OF AREAS IN THE 
CITY THAT ARE WITHIN

[Captioner] 20:28:41
 A 
RELATIVELY SHORT DISTANCE OF 
TRANSIT

[Captioner] 20:28:44
 OR PLANNED TRANSIT OR 
GOOD BUS

[Captioner] 20:28:48
 SERVICE ET CETERA.
THERE HAS BEEN A BALANCE STRUCK

[Captioner] 20:28:52
 
IN OUR GENERAL PLAN AND ZONING 
BETWEEN INTENSITY AND

[Captioner] 20:28:55
 THE 
ADJACENT INTENSITY.
SO WE WANT

[Captioner] 20:28:59
 TO OBVIOUSLY PROVIDE 
AS MUCH INTENSITY AS WE CAN

[Captioner] 20:29:02
 IN 
PROXIMITY TO TRANSIT.
HOWEVER AS WE'VE TALKED ON

[Captioner] 20:29:05
 THIS 
MEETING, THIS PROJECT IS A 
LITTLE LESS

[Captioner] 20:29:09
 INTENSE THAN THE 
PROJECT TO ITS IMMEDIATE SIDE ON

[Captioner] 20:29:11
 
CENTRAL.
BUT A LITTLE MORE DENSE TAN THE 


[Captioner] 20:29:15
PROJECT TO ITS IMMEDIATE REAR ON 
ARGYLE

[Captioner] 20:29:18
, WHERE THERE IS THE 
TWO-FAMILY HOMES BACK THERE.


[Captioner] 20:29:21
AND SO THIS IS A BLENDING OF 
DENSITY IN THAT RESPECT.


[Captioner] 20:29:26
THE DEVELOPER IS HITTING THE MAX 
DENSITY

[Captioner] 20:29:29
 IN THIS PROJECT THAT'S 
ALLOWED IN OUR ZONING SO IF THEY

[Captioner] 20:29:32
 
WERE TO PROPOSE SOMETHING THAT 
WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE DENSE, THE 


[Captioner] 20:29:36
STAFF WOULD NOT HAVE ALLOWED 
THAT TO PROCEED TO YOU BASED ON

[Captioner] 20:29:39
 
OUR EXISTING RULE.
LIKEWISE THE DEVELOPER

[Captioner] 20:29:43
 DOES FALL 
WITHIN THE PARKING FOR SITE AND 
AFFORDABLE,

[Captioner] 20:29:46
 THE CITY ZONING 
ALLOWS FOR AFFORDABLE

[Captioner] 20:29:49
 BOTH BY 
RIGHT IN LIEU FEES OR PROVISION 
ONSITE

[Captioner] 20:29:52
.
AND SO WE DON'T LOOK AT THE

[Captioner] 20:29:55
 
PROVISION OF AFFORDABLE UNITS 
ONSITE

[Captioner] 20:29:59
 OR PROVISION OF FEES IN 
LIEU OF UNITS

[Captioner] 20:30:03
 AS AN EXCEPTION 
BUT AS ONE OF THE BY RIGHT 
OPTIONS

[Captioner] 20:30:06
, THAT IS THE LAND USE 
THAT EXISTS AND THAT IS

[Captioner] 20:30:09
 WHAT 
STAFF REVIEWS TO.
I'LL TAKE YOUR POINTS TO

[Captioner] 20:30:11
 
ACCOUNT.
I THINK WE CAN ALWAYS CONSIDER 


[Captioner] 20:30:15
WHAT THE NEIGHBORHOOD LOOKS LIKE 
IN THE LONG TERM

[Captioner] 20:30:19
 AND PRIORITIZE 
THE RIGHT MIX OF DENSITY

[Captioner] 20:30:22
.
BUT FOR THIS PROJECT

[Captioner] 20:30:25
 IT IS 
OBJECTIVELY COMPLIANT

[Captioner] 20:30:29
.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   AGAIN 
JOAM I REALIZE YOU ARE PRESENTED

[Captioner] 20:30:32
 
WITH PROJECTS AND TO A CERTAIN 
EXTENT THAT IS WHAT YOU HAVE

[Captioner] 20:30:35
 TO 
WORK WITH.
SO I DO UNDERSTAND THE 


[Captioner] 20:30:38
DIFFICULTY THERE AND THIS 
PROJECT IS WITHIN ZONING AND 
IT'S

[Captioner] 20:30:42
 NOT DENSITY OF IT THAT I 
HAVE A PROBLEM WITH

[Captioner] 20:30:45
.
OKAY.
SO I WILL TAKE A MOTION ON

[Captioner] 20:30:48
 THIS 
ITEM.


[Captioner] 20:30:58
>> Commissioner Yee:   I MAKE A 
MOTION TO ACCEPT STAFF 
RECOMMENDATION

[Captioner] 20:31:02
.
>> Commissioner Liu:   I SECOND.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   WE 


[Captioner] 20:31:05
HAVE A MOTION BY COMMISSIONER 
YEE TO ACCEPT AND

[Captioner] 20:31:09
 A SECOND BY 
COMMISSIONER LIU.
JOEL WILL I

[Captioner] 20:31:12
 ROLL CALL THIS?
>> Planner Pullen:   YES CHAIR 
ON

[Captioner] 20:31:15
 THE COMMISSION NOTED, WHEN I 
CALL YOUR NAME PLEASE STATE

[Captioner] 20:31:18
 YOUR

>>

[Captioner] 20:48:22
 THANK YOU, JOEL.
GOOD EVENING

[Captioner] 20:48:25
 CHAIR, VICE CHEER AND MEMBERS OF THE PLANNING COMMISSION.
THE

[Captioner] 20:48:28
 ITEM BEFORE YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION THE

[Captioner] 20:48:32
 PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO THE AFFORDABLE

[Captioner] 20:48:35
 HOUSING
ORDINANCE TO INTEGRATE

[Captioner] 20:48:39
 LIVE-WORK PREFERENCE POLICY REQUIREMENTS.
WHAT DOES

[Captioner] 20:48:42
 LIVE-WORK PREFERENCE POLICY EXACTLY MEAN IN THIS

[Captioner] 20:48:46
 CONTEXT?
IT MEANS THAT PRIORITY PLACEMENT FOR AFFORDABLE

[Captioner] 20:48:49
 HOUSING UNITS BE GIVEN TO THOSE WHO

[Captioner] 20:48:52
 LIVE OR WORK IN
THE CITY TO THE

[Captioner] 20:48:56
 GREATEST EXTENT ALLOWABLE BEFAIR HOUSING

[Captioner] 20:49:03
 LAWS.
THE PROPOSED POLICY IS TO

[Captioner] 20:49:06
 MITIGATE THE DISPLACEMENT THAT MAY RESULT IN THE

[Captioner] 20:49:10
 DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES
AND INCREASING JOB OPPORTUNITIES.
IT

[Captioner] 20:49:13
 IS DESIGNED TO INCREASE THE PROBABILITY

[Captioner] 20:49:16
 THAT CURRENT RETS DENTS CAN REMAIN IN THE COMMUNITY IN
THE FACE

[Captioner] 20:49:20
 OF INCREASING MARKET RATE RENT AND HOUSING

[Captioner] 20:49:24
 PRICES.
IT IS ALSO DESIGNED TO MAX MAZE THE

[Captioner] 20:49:27
 EFFECTS OF AN IMPROVED JOBS TO

[Captioner] 20:49:30
 HOUSING RATIO BY INCREASING

[Captioner] 20:49:33

HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES FOR LOCAL

[Captioner] 20:49:36
 EMPLOYEES.
I LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT IT HAS BEEN A

[Captioner] 20:49:40
 LONG-STANDING PRACTICE OF THE CITY TO REQUIRE THAT
AFFORDABLE

[Captioner] 20:49:44
 HOUSING PROJECTS RECEIVING

[Captioner] 20:49:47
 CITY FUNDING

[Captioner] 20:49:51
 AND/OR DEVELOPED PURSUANT TO THE CITY'S
AFFORDABLE HOUSING ORDINANCE

[Captioner] 20:49:54
 PROVIDE A LOCAL PRIORITY TO THOSE WHO

[Captioner] 20:49:58
 LIVE OR WORK IN FREMONT.
THIS

[Captioner] 20:50:01
 LOCAL PRACTICE IS BASED ON CITY

[Captioner] 20:50:04
 COUNCIL DOERR TO ENSURE THAT AFFORDABLE

[Captioner] 20:50:08
 DEVELOPMENTS SERVE
THOSE LIVING OR WORKING IN

[Captioner] 20:50:11
 FREMONT TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT ALLOWED BY FAIR

[Captioner] 20:50:16
 HOUSING LAW.


[Captioner] 20:50:20
INTEGRATING THE LOCAL LIVE-WORK PREFERENCE POLICY INTO

[Captioner] 20:50:23
 THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING ORDINANCE WOULD
STRENGTHEN

[Captioner] 20:50:26
 THE REQUIREMENT AND TO ENSURE THAT IT IS

[Captioner] 20:50:29
 TRANSPARENT TO ALL STAKEHOLDERS.
STAFF

[Captioner] 20:50:32
 IS RECOMMENDING THAT THE PLANNING COMMISSION RECOMMEND

[Captioner] 20:50:35
 APPROVAL OF THE PROPOSED REVISIONS TO
THE

[Captioner] 20:50:38
 AFFORDABLE HOUSING ORDINANCE.
I AM NOW OPEN TO

[Captioner] 20:50:42
 ANSWER QUESTIONS.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:50:46
>> THANK YOU, MISS HUGHES.


[Captioner] 20:50:50
COMMISSIONERS, DO WE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FOR STAFF ON

[Captioner] 20:50:55
 THIS ITEM?
CHARLES LIU,

[Captioner] 20:50:59
 PLEASE.
I'M SORRY

[Captioner] 20:51:02
.
COMMISSIONER ZHANG, PLEASE.
>> THANK YOU,

[Captioner] 20:51:05
 CHAIR.
I JUST WANT TO KNOW WHETHER THIS IS APPLIES

[Captioner] 20:51:09
 TO STATE-FUNDED PROJECT

[Captioner] 20:51:12
 LIKE HOME KEY.
>> SO, THANK

[Captioner] 20:51:15
 YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION, COMMISSIONER.
SO, FOR

[Captioner] 20:51:19
 HOME KEY, THE PEOPLE THAT WILL LIVE IN THE

[Captioner] 20:51:22
 PROJECT WILL LIKELY COME FROM

[Captioner] 20:51:26
 THE COUNTY
CENTRALIZED --

[Captioner] 20:51:30
 HE SHOULD SAY COORDINATED ENTRY SYSTEM.
IT IS THE

[Captioner] 20:51:34
 COUNTY THATTED A MINISTERED THE COORDINATED

[Captioner] 20:51:38
 ENTRY SYSTEM TO

[Captioner] 20:51:42
 PRIORITIZE PEOPLE THAT ARE ON
THE LIST FOR THE HOME KEY

[Captioner] 20:51:45
 PROJECT UNIT.


[Captioner] 20:51:49
>> SO ONLY APPLIED TO LIKE

[Captioner] 20:51:52
 A SHELTER AND

[Captioner] 20:51:55
 WINTER SHELTER?
>> SO,

[Captioner] 20:51:59
 FOR THIS PROPOSED POLICY, IT WOULD

[Captioner] 20:52:02
 APPLY TO ANY AFFORDABLE PROJECTS THAT

[Captioner] 20:52:06
 RECEIVE FUNDING
FROM THE CITY OR PROJECTS THAT ARE DEVELOPED

[Captioner] 20:52:09
 PURSUANT TO THE' FORDABLE HOUSING ORDINANCE.
>>

[Captioner] 20:52:13
 OKAY.
AND DO YOU

[Captioner] 20:52:16
 HAVE LIKE THE RESIDENCE YES

[Captioner] 20:52:20
Y

[Captioner] 20:52:23
 CRITERIA?
IS THAT GOING TO BE A CRITERIA YOU

[Captioner] 20:52:31
 YOU CAN PRIORITIZE THE APPLICANT.
>> PEOPLE WHO LIVE

[Captioner] 20:52:34
 AND WORK IN FREMONT HAVE PRIORITIES.
>>

[Captioner] 20:52:38
 THE RESIDENCE

[Captioner] 20:52:41
Y, LIKE LIVING, SITTING FOR A MONTH

[Captioner] 20:52:44
 OR YEAR.
>> FOR MONTH.
OUR POLICY IS FOR 30

[Captioner] 20:52:47
 DAYS.
>> OKAY, THANK YOU.
>> YOU'RE

[Captioner] 20:52:51
 WELCOME.
>> ANYONE ELSE?


[Captioner] 20:52:56
COMMISSIONER YEE.
>> THANK YOU, CHAIR.


[Captioner] 20:53:00
LUCIA, I GUESS IF WE

[Captioner] 20:53:03
 ADOPT THIS, WILL THIS POTENTIALLY INCREASE THE

[Captioner] 20:53:06
 AMOUNT OF PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO

[Captioner] 20:53:09

APPLY?
BECAUSE I'M WONDERING, WHAT IS THE 

[Captioner] 20:53:12
CURRENT PERCENTAGE RIGHT NOW, BEFORE THE CHANGE, IF WE ACCEPT
THIS

[Captioner] 20:53:15
 ORDINANCE CHANGE, OR THIS POLICY CHANGE.
>> IT WILL

[Captioner] 20:53:19
 NOT INCREASE OR DECREASE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT WILL APPLY

[Captioner] 20:53:22
 TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING
PROJECT.
HOWEVER,

[Captioner] 20:53:26
 IT WILL INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD THAT

[Captioner] 20:53:28
 PEOPLE THAT LIVE OR WORK IN FREMONT WILL GET

[Captioner] 20:53:32
 AN
AFFORDABLE

[Captioner] 20:53:35
 UNIT.


[Captioner] 20:53:40
>> OKAY.
>> SO, FOR

[Captioner] 20:53:43
 EXAMPLE, I JUST WANT TO GIVE YOU AN

[Captioner] 20:53:47
 EXAMPLE.
WE HAVE AT LEAST, NOT TOO LONG

[Captioner] 20:53:50
 AGO, 57 UNITS

[Captioner] 20:53:53
 AVAILABLE.
AND WE HAD 4,000-SOMETHING PEOPLE

[Captioner] 20:53:57
 APPLY.
>> I HEARD ABOUT THIS, YES.
>> OKAY

[Captioner] 20:54:01
 SO 4,000-SOMETHING PEOPLE APPLY

[Captioner] 20:54:04
 AND ABOUT 150 OF THOSE QUALIFY FOR LIVE OR

[Captioner] 20:54:08
 WORK IN FREMONT
SO

[Captioner] 20:54:11
 THOSE 150 PEOPLE WILL BE

[Captioner] 20:54:15
 CONSIDERED FIRST.
FOR THOSE 57

[Captioner] 20:54:18
 UNITS, BEFORE EVERYBODY ELSE.
>>

[Captioner] 20:54:21
 OKAY.
NOW I UNDERSTAND.
IT'S

[Captioner] 20:54:24
 VERY CLEAR.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:54:31
>> Chairman Daulton: ANY OTHER QUESTIONS, COMMISSIONERS.
I WAS

[Captioner] 20:54:35
 WONDERING, LUCIA, HOW

[Captioner] 20:54:39
 THIS PROPOSAL, HOW DOES IT SORT

[Captioner] 20:54:42
 OF INTERSECT WITH THE IDENTIFICATION OF

[Captioner] 20:54:46

AT-RISK RENTERS WITHIN FREMONT

[Captioner] 20:54:52
 POPULATION?
IS THERE A PROCESS FOR

[Captioner] 20:54:55
 THAT?
>> SO, THIS DOES NOT

[Captioner] 20:54:58
 IDENTIFY WHO IS MORE AT -- ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT AT

[Captioner] 20:55:01
 RISK OF HOMELESSNESS?
>> Chairman Daulton: YES.
>>

[Captioner] 20:55:05
 THIS, WE DO NOT IDENTIFY PEOPLE THAT ARE MORE

[Captioner] 20:55:08
 AT RISK IN ORDER TO, YOU KNOW, TO BE

[Captioner] 20:55:12
 FURTHER
PRIORITIZ

[Captioner] 20:55:15
ED, BUT HOWEVER, ALL OF OUR AFFORDABLE HOUSING

[Captioner] 20:55:19
 DEVELOPMENTS, THEY HAVE AN INCOME
REQUIREMENT.
THERE WILL BE

[Captioner] 20:55:22
 SOME UNITS FOR PEOPLE WHO MAKE LESS THAN 30%

[Captioner] 20:55:26
 OF AREA MEDIAN INCOME.
SOME UNITS

[Captioner] 20:55:29
 WILL BE FOUR PEOPLE.
HOUSEHOLDS THAT MAKE LESS THAN 50%

[Captioner] 20:55:32
 OF AREA MEDIAN INCOME.


[Captioner] 20:55:36
SO, PEOPLE MUST MEET THE INCOME REQUIREMENTS IN ORDER

[Captioner] 20:55:39
 TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR A UNIT, SO

[Captioner] 20:55:43
 THAT'S THE
BASIC REQUIREMENT, THRESHOLD

[Captioner] 20:55:46
 REQUIREMENT IS THE INCOME.
AND THEN, WE WILL

[Captioner] 20:55:50
 LOOK INTO WHETHER OR NOT THEY LIVE OR WORK IN FREMONT.
IF

[Captioner] 20:55:54
 THEY DO, THEY HAVE PRIORITY OVER THOSE THAT DON'T.
>> Chairman Daulton: 

[Captioner] 20:55:57
AND WHAT'S THE MECHANISM BY

[Captioner] 20:56:01
 WHICH THIS NEW PROGRAM WILL BE

[Captioner] 20:56:04
 ADVERTISED IN THE
COMMUNITY?
>> SO,

[Captioner] 20:56:07
 IT WILL BE ADVERTISED THE SAME WAY AS WE'VE BEEN

[Captioner] 20:56:11
 ADVERTISING FOR MANY YEARS.
SO WE HAVE AN'

[Captioner] 20:56:15
 AN AFFORDABLE HOUSING INTEREST LIST THE

[Captioner] 20:56:18
 CITY KEEPS.
ANYBODY, IT DOESN'T MATTER IF THEY LIVE

[Captioner] 20:56:21
 OR WORK IN FREMONT, ANYBODY CAN SIGN UP ON THIS

[Captioner] 20:56:25
 AFFORDABLE
HOUSING INTEREST LIST.


[Captioner] 20:56:28
AND WHENEVER WE HAVE AN AFFORDABLE HOUSING

[Captioner] 20:56:31
 OPPORTUNITY, MEANING THAT IF DEVELOPERS ARE ACCEPTING

[Captioner] 20:56:36

APPLICATIONS, AND THE CITY WILL NOTIFY PEOPLE THAT SEEN UP

[Captioner] 20:56:39
 ON THE LIST TO LET THEM KNOW THIS
OPPORTUNITY

[Captioner] 20:56:43
 IS COMING UP.
THIS IS WHEN APPLICATIONS ARE DUE.


[Captioner] 20:56:46
AND, IF YOU'RE INTERESTED, PLEASE APPLY BY THE

[Captioner] 20:56:49
 DEADLINE DATE.
SO THE PROCESS IS STILL THE SAME.
THE MARKETING

[Captioner] 20:56:52
 IS STILL GOING TO BE

[Captioner] 20:56:55
 THE SAME

[Captioner] 20:56:58
.
>> Chairman Daulton: COMMISSIONE R BASRAI.


[Captioner] 20:57:01
>> SO MAYBE I HAVEN'T -- I TRIED

[Captioner] 20:57:04
 TO READ THROUGH IT, BUT GIVEN THE HEAR NUMBER OF

[Captioner] 20:57:07
 LAYOFFS LATELY,
WHAT IS THE SORT OF PLAN

[Captioner] 20:57:10
 IF SOMEBODY WHO

[Captioner] 20:57:16
 QUALIFIED FOR THE

[Captioner] 20:57:19
 INCOME AND IS SUDDENLY LAID OFF,
ACTIVELY JOB

[Captioner] 20:57:22
 SEARCHING BUT LIVES IN FREMONT, WHAT HAPPENS THEN?
I THINK

[Captioner] 20:57:25
 WE'RE ALL KIND OF SEEING THAT RIGHT NOW.
>>

[Captioner] 20:57:29
 SO, AS LONG AS THEY'RE INCOME ELIGIBLE AT

[Captioner] 20:57:33
 THE TIME OF

[Captioner] 20:57:36
 APPLICATION, THEY MAY BE CONSIDERED FOR A
UNIT.


[Captioner] 20:57:39
SO, IF THEY'RE LAYED OFF AND THEN

[Captioner] 20:57:42
 THEY CAN'T SUBMIT ALL OF THEIR INCOME DOCUMENTATION TO THE

[Captioner] 20:57:46

DEVELOPER, THE DEVELOPER WILL LOOK AT IT AND SEE

[Captioner] 20:57:49
 IF THIS HOUSEHOLD STILL QUALIFIES FOR A 30%

[Captioner] 20:57:52
 UNIT
OR 50% UNIT OR 60 PRESIDENTS UNIT.
>> BUT IT

[Captioner] 20:57:56
 IS UP TO THE DEVELOPER?
>> YES, AND THEY HAVE

[Captioner] 20:57:59
 REGULATIONS THAT THEY NEED TO FOLLOW TO INCOME QUALIFY

[Captioner] 20:58:06
 HOUSEHOLDS.
>> OKAY.
I THINK WE NEED TO

[Captioner] 20:58:09
 MAKE THAT CLEAR AS PART OF IT.
WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF TOUGH

[Captioner] 20:58:13
 TIMES LATELY

[Captioner] 20:58:18
.
>> Chairman Daulton: COMMISSIONE R

[Captioner] 20:58:22
 ZHANG, PLEASE.
>> THANK YOU, CHAIR.


[Captioner] 20:58:25
THIS ONLY APPLIES TO FREMONT RESIDENTS,

[Captioner] 20:58:29
 WE OFTEN TALK ABOUT THE TRI-CITY

[Captioner] 20:58:32
 AND WE WORK

[Captioner] 20:58:36
 TOGETHER, BUT
THIS ONLY APPLIES TO FREMONT ONLY,

[Captioner] 20:58:39
 RIGHT?
>> YES, BECAUSE IT'S IN OUR CITY, AND

[Captioner] 20:58:42
 ALSO A LOT OF THESE PROJECTS ARE FUNDED BY THE

[Captioner] 20:58:45
 CITY
AFFORDABLE HOUSING FUND, SO THE CITY

[Captioner] 20:58:49
 COUNCIL WAS VERY CLEAR THAT, YOU KNOW, THE COUNCIL

[Captioner] 20:58:52
 WOULD LIKE
TO PRIORITIZE PEOPLE THAT LIVE

[Captioner] 20:58:55
 OR WORK IN FREMONT.
>> OKAY, THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:59:01
>> Chairman Daulton: ANY OTHER QUESTIONS?


[Captioner] 20:59:05
ALL RIGHT.
I THINK THIS IS A GREAT THING.
I THINK

[Captioner] 20:59:09
 WE SHOULD APPRECIATE ADVERTISE PEOPLE WHO LIVE AND WORK IN

[Captioner] 20:59:12
 FREMONT FOR THESE PROGRAMS.
AND,

[Captioner] 20:59:15
 VIRTUALLY NO ONE I'VE SPOKEN TO

[Captioner] 20:59:18
 REGARDING THESE KINDS OF PROGRAMS HAS ANY OTHER OPINION ON

[Captioner] 20:59:22
 IT
THAN WE SHOULD, YOU KNOW, APPRECIATE ADVERTISE

[Captioner] 20:59:27
 FAMILIES, VETERAN -- PRIORITIZE FAMILIES,

[Captioner] 20:59:30
 VETERANS,
PEOPLE WHO WORK HERE.
SO I'M REALLY GLAD

[Captioner] 20:59:33
 TO SEE THAT.
I BELIEVE THAT THE POINT I COULD ASK FOR A

[Captioner] 20:59:37
 MOTION FROM THE COMMISSION.
>> BEFORE

[Captioner] 20:59:40
 WE DO THAT, WE SHOULD CHECK AND SEE IF

[Captioner] 20:59:44
 ANYBODY FROM THE PUBLIC WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK.
>> IS THERE PUBLIC COMMENT ON

[Captioner] 20:59:47
 THIS, TRISH.
>> I WAS GOING TO SAY

[Captioner] 20:59:50
 THE SAME THING.
I SEE TWO ATTENDEES, IF YOU WOULD

[Captioner] 20:59:53
 LIKE TO SPEAK, NOW IS

[Captioner] 20:59:57
 THE TIME TO RAISE YOUR HAND.
I

[Captioner] 21:00:01
 DON'T SEE ANYONE FROM THE PUBLIC RAISING THEIR HAND, SO NO

[Captioner] 21:00:04
 SPEAKERS FROM THE PUBLIC TONIGHT.
>> I READ THEIR MIND CAN WE GET

[Captioner] 21:00:07
 A MOTION ON THIS.
>> I MAKE A MOTION TO ACCEPT STAFF

[Captioner] 21:00:10
 RECOMMENDATION ON THIS.
>> SECOND.
>> I HAVE A

[Captioner] 21:00:16
 MOTION FROM COMMISSIONER YEE, A SECOND

[Captioner] 21:00:19
 FROM COMMISSIONER ZHANG AMOUNT ROLL CALL

[Captioner] 21:00:23

>> YES, ON A MOTION TO

[Captioner] 21:00:26

[Captioner] 21:00:29
 RECOMMENDATION THE CITY
COUNCIL HAS AS A CODE UPDATE SO YOUR

[Captioner] 21:00:32

[Captioner] 21:00:36

[Captioner] 21:00:39
.
PLEASE VOTE ON THEIR RECOMMENDATION TO APPROVE.


[Captioner] 21:00:44
[ROLL CALL]


[Captioner] 21:01:09
>> ALL RIGHT, A UNANIMOUS VOTE OF THE

[Captioner] 21:01:12
 PLANNING COMMISSION, THE PROJECT HAS BEEN RECOMMENDED TO CITY

[Captioner] 21:01:15

COUNCIL FOR APPROVAL.
THIS ITEM WILL BE BROUGHT TO AN

[Captioner] 21:01:19
 UPCOMING CITY COUNCIL MEETING AGENDA.
AND THAT

[Captioner] 21:01:22
 CONCLUDES ALL OF OUR THREE

[Captioner] 21:01:26
 ITEMS FOR TONIGHT.
>> THAT'S IT.
SO LET'S MOVE ON TO

[Captioner] 21:01:35
TO MISCELLANEOUS ITEMS.
STAFF

[Captioner] 21:01:39
 UPDATE.
>> OUR DECEMBER MEETINGS.
FIRST OF ALL,

[Captioner] 21:01:42
 FOR THE HOUSING ELEMENT, AS YOU KNOW, WE'VE

[Captioner] 21:01:45
 GIVEN UPDATES I BELIEVE LAST IN

[Captioner] 21:01:48
 OCTOBER,
ABOUT THE TRAJECTORY

[Captioner] 21:01:51
 TO BE PROVIDED TO THE STATE IN AUGUST.
THEY MET WITH

[Captioner] 21:01:55
 US IN THE SUMMER AND EARLY FALL, AND HAVE

[Captioner] 21:02:00
 PROVIDED SOME INTERIM COMMENTS AND WILL
PROVIDE

[Captioner] 21:02:03
 FORMAL COMMENTS BY THE DAY BEFORE THE THANKSGIVING BREAK NEXT

[Captioner] 21:02:06
 WEEK.
SO WE WILL BE TURNING THOSE BACK OVER TO YOU AT THE

[Captioner] 21:02:09
 END OF DECEMBER AND THEN THE CITY COUNCIL

[Captioner] 21:02:12
 EARLY
NEXT YEAR.
SO THERE WILL BE SOME

[Captioner] 21:02:15
 HOUSING ELEMENT CONTENT COMING UP.
AND THAT BRINGS ME

[Captioner] 21:02:19
 TO MY NEXT POINT WHICH IS IN THE MONTH OF DECEMBER,

[Captioner] 21:02:22
 WHILE WE'VE BEEN HAVING
RELATIVELY FEW PLANNING

[Captioner] 21:02:25
 COMMISSION MEETINGS THIS MONTH, USUALLY ONE PER MONTH, WE

[Captioner] 21:02:28
 HAVE TWO MEETINGS
IN DECEMBER.
OUR REGULARLY-SCHEDULED

[Captioner] 21:02:32
 MEETING ON DECEMBER 8 AND ON DECEMBER 22 WITH

[Captioner] 21:02:35
 AN ACTION PACKED NIGHT OF
EVENTS BOTH
