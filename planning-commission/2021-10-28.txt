MY COMMENT
19:09:17  IS ON A PREVIOUS 
DEVELOPMENT
19:09:20 ,
19:09:24  PACIFIC COMMONS.
PACIFIC COMMONS IS NOW OPEN
19:09:28  WITH 
THE LOGISTIC CENTERS.
AS PART OF THAT
19:09:31  DEVELOPMENT WE 
INCLUDED PUBLIC TRAILS FOR THE 
BAY TRAIL WHICH
19:09:34  ARE VERY NICE 
AND WERE PUT IN FOR THE 
DEVELOPER.

19:09:37 HOWEVER, WE SEE NOW THAT THERE 
IS NO PUBLIC PARKING FOR
19:09:39  THOSE 
TRAILS.
WELL, THERE IS SOME PUBLIC 

19:09:42 PARKING.
THE WORKS DEPARTMENT HAS ALLOWED 
PARKING
19:09:46  
PARK
19:09:50 ING ON THE CUL-DE-SACS TWO 
MILES AWAY
19:09:53 , THAT IS KIND OF 
HIDDEN
19:09:56 .
WE HAVE THIS VERY LARGE 
DEVELOPMENT, 150
19:10:00  ACRES WITH 
PUBLIC AMENITIES, THE IMAI
19:10:03  BAY TRAIL 
WHICH
19:10:06  ARE VERY NICE BUT NEVER 
DID WE PLAN TO HAVE ALLOWED THE 
PUBLIC
19:10:09  TO GET TO IT AND PARK 
THERE.
AND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING
19:10:12  
THAT SHOULD BE LOOKED AT.
AND REVIEWED.
19:10:15 
HOW WE COULD CORRECT THAT NEXT 
TIME
19:10:18  WE HAVE A MAJOR DEVELOPMENT 
LIKE THAT
19:10:23 .
AND I'LL POINT
19:10:26  OUT THAT THE  
CUL-DE-SACS
19:10:29  ALTHOUGH SOMETHING 
FROM THE WORKS DEPARTMENT
19:10:33  ARE 
NOT VERY ADEQUATE FOR
19:10:37  
HANDICAPPED PEOPLE.
WE HAVE THESE VERY
19:10:40  NICE TRAILS 
WITH VERY LITTLE ABILITY FOR
19:10:43  
HANDY ACADEMY PEOPLE TO
19:10:46  
HANDICAPPED PEOPLE TO GET TO 
THEM AND
19:10:50  USE THEM.
THAT IS SOMETHING FOR THE 
PLANNING DEPARTMENT
19:10:53  TO THINK 
ABOUT IN THE FUTURE.
>> Commissioner Yee:   THANK 

19:10:55 YOU.
TRISH YOU SAID HE WAS OUR ONLY 
SPEAKER?

19:10:59 >> CORRECT.
WE DO NOT HAVE ANY MORE 
SPEAKERS, THANK YOU.
19:11:02 
>> Commissioner Yee:   OKAY SO 
THEN I'LL MOVE ON TO PUBLIC 

19:11:05 HEARING.
I'D LIKE TO OPEN THE PUBLIC 
HEARING TO MOVE ON TO OUR
19:11:08  
REGULAR AGENDA ITEM.
WE HAVE JUST ONE AGENDA ITEM
19:11:11  
TONIGHT.
SO JOEL COULD YOU PLEASE READ 

19:11:14 THAT AGENDA ITEM.

19:11:20 >> Planner Pullen:   YES CHAIR.
ITEM 1 ON THE PUBLIC HEARING
19:11:23  
AGENDA AND THE ONLY ITEM ON THE 
AGENDA TONIGHT
19:11:28  IS
19:11:32 
SAKOON LUX HOMES - 4092 DECOTO
ROAD.

19:11:35 THIS IS TO CONSIDER A
19:11:38  
DISCRETIONARY DESIGN
19:11:43 
REVIEW, PRIVATE STREET, AND
TENTATIVE TRACT MAP 8580 FOR A

19:11:45 NEW FOUR-STORY BUILDING
CONSISTING OF EIGHT
RESIDENTIAL CONDOMINIUM UNITS

19:11:47 AND PARKING GARAGE, AND TWO
COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS TOTALING
2,250 SQUARE-FEET; LOCATED IN

19:11:50 THE CENTERVILLE COMMUNITY PLAN
AREA; AND TO CONSIDER A
CATEGORICAL EXEMPTION FROM THE

19:11:53 CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY
ACT
19:11:56  OR CEQA, PER THE GUIDELINES 
SECTION
19:11:59  15332 AS AN IN-FILL
19:12:04  
DEVELOPMENT AND ALSO
19:12:07  CONSISTENCY 
WITH THE GENERAL PLAN AND ZONING
19:12:11 
ZONING.
TONIGHT WE HAVE DID PLANNER
19:12:15  HERE 
MARC CLEVELAND, WHO HAS A
19:12:18  
PRESENTATION AND AFTER THE 
PRESENTATION
19:12:24  THE APPLICANT HAS A 
CHANCE TO PRESENT.
>> Commissioner Yee:   SO I 

19:12:27 GUESS WE'RE GOING TO HAVE STAFF 
PREPGHT.
>> GOOD EVENING,
19:12:30  FOR PEOPLE ON 
THE PHONE THIS IS
19:12:34  MARC 
CLEVELAND, STAFF PLANNER.
I'M GOING
19:12:37  TO GO AHEAD AND SHARE 
MY SCREEN.

19:12:48 ALL RIGHT, CAN YOU ALL SEE IT?
>> Commissioner Yee:   YES
19:12:51 .
>> OKAY, PERFECT.
AS
19:12:55  JOAM STATED, THIS IS
19:12:58  IS S
19:13:01 
SAKOON LUX HOMES
19:13:04 .
WE'LL GO THROUGH THE DESIGN, THE 
ANALYSIS AND
19:13:08  STAFF 
RECOMMENDATION AND THEN IF YOU 
GUYS HAVE ANY QUESTIONS
19:13:12 .
THE TENTATIVE TRACT MAP
19:13:16 , DESIGN 
REVIEW AND PRIVATE STREET, 
LOCATED
19:13:20  AT 4092 WHICH IS THE 
GENERAL PLAN ZONE OF THE
19:13:23  
COMMERCIAL MIXED USE.
ITS ZONING IS MIXED USE AND IT 

19:13:26 IS SURROUNDED TO THE -- WELL, BY
19:13:29  
IT WOULD BE THE ADDITIONAL MIXED 
USE ACROSS THE STREET YOU
19:13:33  HAVE 
RESIDENTIAL WHICH REPRESENTS 
DOWN HOMES
19:13:41  DUETS, AND SOME 
RESIDENTIAL
19:13:44  TOWARDS THE BACK.
IT'S ALSO
19:13:47  ADJACENT TO SOME 
VACANT LOTS.

19:13:52 SO AS STATED IT WAS A VACANT 
SITE, WE ARE
19:13:56  PROPOSING 2200 
SQUARE FEET OF COMMERCIAL 
BUILDINGS,
19:13:59  TWO DIFFERENT 
BUILDINGS EACH AROUND 1100 PLUS 
OR MINUS A
19:14:02  FEW SQUARE FEET AND 
THERE WILL ALSO BE EIGHT MARKET
19:14:06  
RATE RESIDENTIAL CONDOS OVER A 
PARKING GARAGE LOCATED TOWARDS
19:14:09  
THE BACK OF THE PROPERTY.
19:14:13 
DURING THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE 
PLAN WE HAD A COUPLE DIFFERENT 

19:14:17 ISSUES THAT WE HAD TO WORK ON 
THAT DO THE LIMITATIONS
19:14:20  OF THE 
SITE WHICH IS ABOUT .32 ACRES.
IN ORDER TO
19:14:23  GET THE GARBAGE 
TRUCKS WE HAD TO CREATE 
DIFFERENT
19:14:26  TURN ABOUT SITUATION, 
WHICH
19:14:29  WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE 
PROJECT PLANS SOME OF THE 
TURNING RADIUS THAT
19:14:32  THEY HAVE AS 
WELL AS FIRE DEPARTMENT ACCESS 
ON SUCH
19:14:35  A LIMITED SITE WHERE 
THEY GET LADDERS.
THE
19:14:45  COMMERCIAL SPACE SIZE WAS 
HARD TO NAIL DOWN TO GET IT
19:14:45  IN 
CONFORMANCE WITH THE GENERAL 
PLAN, SO THAT IS SOMETHING
19:14:45  WHERE 
WE HAVE THESE UNIQUE-SHAPED 
BUILDINGS
19:14:48 .
ALSO IN OUR ZONING STANDARDS AND 
DESIGN REVIEW WE'RE NOT
19:14:51  SUPPOSED 
TO HAVE A BLANK WALL
19:14:55  THAT ISN'T 
AN ENTRANCE FACING A STREET 
SPACE.

19:14:58 SO ONE OF THE SOLUTIONS WE CAME 
UP WITH IS A MURAL ON
19:15:00  ONE 
BUILDING THAT DOESN'T HAVE THE 
ENTRANCE ON IT.

19:15:03 AND THOSE ARE KIND OF THE 
DIFFERENT THINGS THAT WE
19:15:05  WORKED 
THROUGH AS STAFF DURING THIS 
TIME.

19:15:08 SO AS STATED THIS IS SITE PLAN.
YOU HAVE THE CONDO OS IN THE
19:15:12  
BACK WITH THE PARKING GARAGE AND 
19:15:15 
THE TWO COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS
19:15:18  ON 
THE STREET, THERE WILL BE A NEW 
COMMERCIAL
19:15:22  STREET WIDE ENOUGH 
FOR FIRE AS WELL AS FOR
19:15:25  PUBLIC 
SERVICES TO GET THROUGH DOWN THE 
MIDDLE AND THEN THEY
19:15:28  ARE ALSO 
DOING SEVEN
19:15:32  FEET OF SIDEWALK
19:15:37  
DESIGNATION ON THE FRONT.
THE DESIGN
19:15:41  IS CONTEMPORARY 
DESIGN WITH
19:15:44  PRIMARY STUCCO AND
19:15:47  
BRICK AND ON THE BACK IT IS THE 
SAME CONTEMPORARY STUCCO
19:15:50  
COMMERCIAL WITH WOOD SIDING AS 
WELL.

19:16:02 AS NOR THE PARKING THEY ARE 
REQUIRED TO HAVE
19:16:05  23 SPACES, THEY 
ARE PROVIDING
19:16:08  16 PACE SPACES, 
CODE WOULD
19:16:11  ALLOW JOINT USE 
SHARING FOR MIXED USE
19:16:16  PROJECTS, 
AS LONG AS THEY MEET
19:16:19  CERTAIN 
CRITERIA.
THE PARKING WILL FUNCTION AS 

19:16:22 KIND OF AN UNBUNDLED UNASSIGNED 
PARKING
19:16:26  FOR ALL THE SPACES WHICH 
IS BASED ON THE PARKING 
STATEMENT PROVIDED
19:16:29  BY THE 
APPLICANT.
19:16:33 
AND IT WAS ATTACHED TO THE STAFF 
REPORT.

19:16:36 KIND OF THE IDEA IS THE SMALL 
NATURE OF THE COMMERCIAL 
BUILDINGS
19:16:39  ARE GOING TO LEND 
THEMSELVES OUT TO SMALLER 
SERVICE
19:16:42  AND OFFICE USES THAT 
WILL
19:16:45  HELP
19:16:49  ALLEVIATE SOME OF
19:16:53  
THAT.
FINDING THAT WOULD BE
19:16:56  THE NORMAL 
HOURS OF OPERATION WILL BE 
DIFFERENT
19:16:59  DEMAND PEAK HOURS.
MOST DRENTSD WILL BE GOING OFF
19:17:06  RESIDENTS WILL BE GOING OFF 
TO WORK AND WHEN
19:17:10  THE BUSINESSES 
ARE
19:17:14  CLOSED RESIDENTS WILL BE 
COMING BACK.
TRANSIT AREA, I'LL
19:17:17  BE GOING OVER 
IN JEBLGHT, IT
19:17:20  
IN JUST A SECOND.
RESIDENTIAL
19:17:24 , COMMERCIAL PARKING 
DEMANDS DURING
19:17:27  DIFFERENT PARTS 
OF THE DAY SO YOU HAVE NORMAL 
BUSINESS HOURS.
19:17:30 
SO LOOKING AT THE TRANSIT 
ALTERNATIVES THERE IS A BUS STOP 

19:17:33 THAT IS ABOUT .2 MILES AWAY, 
QUICK LITTLE WALK
19:17:37 , IT'S AC 200 
WHICH GOES
19:17:40  TO BOTH THE UNION 
CITY AND THE
19:17:43  FREMONT BART 
STATION AND HAS VARIOUS STOPS 
ALONG THE
19:17:46  WAY THAT INCLUDE 
NEWPARK MALL, SHOPPING CENTER
19:17:50  IN 
NEWARK AS WELL AS THE PARK AND 
RIDE OVER BY
19:17:53  ARDENWOOD ACROSS 
DUMBARTON BRIDGE
19:17:57  WHICH ALSO 
SERVICES THE DUMBARTON EXPRESS 
WHICH YOU
19:18:00  CAN GET ON 4092, OR
19:18:03  BY 
THAT SAME BUS STOP WHICH GETS 
YOU ALL THE WAY
19:18:07  TO THE STANFORD 
SHOPPING CENTER AROUND STANFORD 
IN
19:18:10  PALO ALTO.
KIND OF AN AREA YOU CAN HAVE 
COMMUTING
19:18:13  BETWEEN THE JOBS 
ACROSS THE BAY, AS WELL.
LOOKING
19:18:16  AT THEIR -- SORRY -- 
LOOKING AT
19:18:19  THEIR SCHEDULES, THE 
AC TRANSIT LINE
19:18:22  HAS A STOP ABOUT 
EVERY 20 MINUTES AND THE
19:18:26  
DUMBARTON EXPRESS IS ABOUT EVERY 
30 MINUTES.
19:18:30 
SO AS FAR AS THE GENERAL PLAN 
AND ZONING QUOMPLEZ
19:18:33  CONFORMANCE, THIS 
PROJECT HELPS CONTINUE
19:18:36  OUR 
INFULL EMPHASIS AND INFILL 
DEVELOPMENT BY
19:18:39  TAKING A VACANT 
LOT THAT IS -- DOESN'T HAVE
19:18:43  
ANYTHING ON IT IN A SMALLER AREA 
AS WELL AS PUTS A MIXED USE
19:18:46  
WHICH WE ARE STILL TRYING TO 
EMPHASIZE IN THIS AREA BASED ON 

19:18:49 THE GENERAL PLAN AND DECOTO IS 
MENTIONED IN THE GENERAL PLAN IS
19:18:52  
BEING KIND OF AN AREA OF 
INTEREST BASS
19:18:56  IT IS AN ENTRANCE 
TO FREMONT SO THEY WOULD LIKE TO 
SEE
19:18:59  MORE PROJECTS OVER HERE 
WHICH THIS WOULD BE CONSISTENT 
WITH.

19:19:02 AS FAR AS THE ZONING CONFORMANCE 
THE PROJECT USES THE MX
19:19:06  AND 
WHERE RESIDENTIAL REQUIREMENTS 
RND COVERED BY THE
19:19:09  M EXMPT, THEY 
ARE COVERED CLOSELY BY THE R-
19:19:12 335 
WHICH IS DETERMINED BY THE 
AMOUNT OF
19:19:16  THE UNIT, SORRY, PER-
19:19:18 
PER-ACRE MEASUREMENT.
AND THE COMMERCIAL REQUIREMENTS

THAT WAS IT FOR
19:20:36  MY PRESENTATION.
>> Commissioner Yee:   ALL 
RIGHT, THANK YOU MARC.

19:20:40 ANY COMMISSIONERS HERE HAVE ANY, 
YOU KNOW,
19:20:43  QUESTIONS ON WHAT WAS 
JUST PRESENTED ON THE SLIDE SET
19:20:47 ?
>> Commissioner Steckler:   I 
DO.
19:20:48 
>> Commissioner Yee:   
COMMISSIONER STECKLER.

19:20:52 >> Commissioner Steckler:   
YEAH, I'M JUST CONCERNED WITH 
THIS WHOLE PARKING THING
19:20:55 .
AND ABSENT STAFF OR
19:20:58  JOEL, IS 
THERE ANY OTHER.
>>> PROTHAT WE'VE
19:21:02  PROJECTS THAT
19:21:05  
WE'VE APPROVED THAT HAVE SUCH 
BROAD ASSUMPTIONS THAT
19:21:09  CARS ARE 
GOING TO BE THERE CERTAIN HOURS
19:21:12  
AND CARS ARE NOT GOING TO BE
19:21:15  AT 
HOME.
I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING ABOUT A 

19:21:18 MARRIED COUPLE WITH TWO CARS BUT 
ONLY ONE WAGE-EARNER
19:21:21  SO YOU'RE 
GOING TO HAVE A SECOND CAR.
I'M JUST WONDERING HAVE
19:21:25  WE DONE 
THIS HISTORICALLY?
YOU KNOW STEPPED
19:21:28  ASIDE OF THE 
PARKING REQUIREMENTS?

19:21:39 >> Planner Pullen:   SO I CAN 
JUMP IN HERE.
SO WE HAVE THE
19:21:42  SHARED PARKING 
SPECIFICALLY FOR MIXED USE, IT'S 
BEEN IN THE
19:21:45  CODE SINCE THE FIRST 
MIXED USE ORDINANCE WAS PASSED
19:21:48  
BACK IN THE
19:21:51  LATE OUG
19:21:59  OUGHT
19:22:04  DECADE 
ABOUT
19:22:07  A DECADE AGO.
IT'S BEEN
19:22:13  IN THE STANDING YEARS, 
VARIOUS FINDINGS THAT HAVE TO BE
19:22:16  
MADE AND YOU'RE RIGHT, THERE ARE 
SITUATIONS IN WHICH IT WOULD 

19:22:19 WORK AND SITUATIONS IN WHICH IT 
WOULDN'T WORK.
AND
19:22:22  SO PART OF MARC
19:22:26 'S 
PRESENTATION WAS, I THINK HE 
USED
19:22:29  THE TERM MOST PEOPLE GOING 
TO WORK.
WE DON'T KNOW
19:22:32  WHAT THAT NUMBER 
WILL BE.
WE ARE NOT BUILDING SORT OF
19:22:35  FOR 
THE PANDEMIC.
WE'RE BUILDING FOR THE FUTURE
19:22:38 .
YOU KNOW IN SIX MONTHS OR A YEAR 
WILL IT
19:22:41  BE THE SAME AS IT IS IN 
TWO
19:22:45  OR THREE OR FOUR YEARS, 
THERE IS A BIT
19:22:48  OF AMBIGUITY IN 
THAT QUESTION.
ALSO, TO THE EXTENT THAT
19:22:51  PEOPLE, 
YOU KNOW, DON'T WORK FROM HOME
19:22:54 , 
BARRING THAT, THE
19:22:58  ACTUAL SUITES 
THEMSELVES WOULD VARY AND
19:23:01  THE 
PROPERTY, BECAUSE IT
19:23:05  HAS KIND OF 
RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL ON 
THE SAME
19:23:08  PROPERTY, THERE IS SOME 
CONTROL THERE IN THE
19:23:11  PROPERTY 
OWNER ASSOCIATION, AS TO THE 
TYPE OF
19:23:14  UNITS OR THE TYPE OF 
USES THAT CAN GO IN.
19:23:18 
BECAUSE THERE WILL BE A JOINT 
BENEFIT OR A JOINT SORT
19:23:22  OF 
OBLIGATION TO PLAN FOR THEIR
19:23:26  OWN 
SUFFICIENT USE OF PARKING.
SO I THINK THEY HAVE
19:23:29  IT WITHIN 
THEIR OWN POWER AS PROPERTY 
OWNER ASSOCIATION TO
19:23:33  SET IT UP 
IN A BENEFICIAL WAY.
YOU WOULDN'T
19:23:36  WANT, FOR EXAMPLE, 
A -- YOU KNOW A
19:23:39  DAYTIME, YOU 
KNOW, HEAVY OR
19:23:42  LET'S SAY MAYBE A 
GUEST PARKING HEAVY USE
19:23:45 , LET'S 
SAY, THERE.
AND YOU CAN
19:23:48  ADJUST THAT.
ON THE EXAMPLE THAT WAS SHOWN
19:23:52  ON 
MARC'S SLIGHT I THINK IT SAYS 
ARCHITECTS
19:23:55  AND INSURANCE.
SO UNDER THAT SCENARIO, THINKING 
ABOUT THE
19:23:58  VARIOUS OPERATIONS IN 
TOWN, YOU MIGHT HAVE
19:24:01 , YOU KNOW, 
TWO OR THREE, THREE OR FOUR 
PEOPLE
19:24:04 , YOU KNOW, OPERATING AND 
PEOPLE OCCASIONAL VISITING
19:24:07  AND 
THOSE SHUT DOWN AT A CERTAIN 
TIME.

19:24:10 SO I THINK IT'S DEFINITELY 
SOMETHING THAT THE PLANNING 
COMMISSION
19:24:14  CAN WRESTLE WITH AND 
TALK ABOUT AND SEE IF THERE ARE 
CONTROLS THAT
19:24:17  SHOULD BE PLACED 
OR IF YOU ARE ON
19:24:20  BOARD WITH THE
19:24:25  
MIXED USE JOINT USE PARKING AS 
PROPOSED
19:24:27 .
>> Commissioner Steckler:   
THANK YOU.

19:24:30 >> Commissioner Yee:   
COMMISSIONER McDONALD.
I SEE YOUR HAND RAISED.

19:24:36 >> Commissioner McDonald:   I'M 
GOING TO BE GOING BACK TO
19:24:40  THIS 
PARKING ISSUE ONE MORE TIME.
JOEL I WAS CONFUSED BECAUSE
19:24:43  IT 
SAID THE MINIMUM PARKING 
REQUIRED WAS 23 SPACES.

19:24:46 AND IN THE DOCUMENT
19:24:59  IT SAYS 16 
SPACES.
HOW MANY CAR PARKING SPACES
19:25:02  ARE 
WE REFERRING TO HERE?
>> I SORT OF
19:25:05  FLEW BY THAT.
THEY HAVE 15 ACTUAL SPACE AND
19:25:08  
THEY GET CREDIT FOR THE AMOUNT 
OF BIKE PARK
19:25:12 ING THEY CURRENTLY 
HAVE, ONE SPACE
19:25:13 .
>> Commissioner McDonald:   THIS 
IS MY QUESTION.

19:25:16 WE HAVE EIGHT UNITS WITH TWO 
BEDROOMS EACH AND
19:25:19  WE REQUIRE 16 
SPACES TOTAL FOR THOSE EIGHT 
UNITS.

19:25:24  RESIDENTIAL.
IF
19:25:28  WE ACTUALLY HAVE 16 SPACES 
WHICH WE ACTUALLY DON'T, WE
19:25:31  ONLY 
HAVE 15, THEN THAT WOULD MEAN 
THAT WE HAD
19:25:34  THE MINIMUM-MAXIMUM
19:25:37  
RIDE FOR THOSE EIGHT APARTMENTS 
OR CONDOS.
19:25:40 
NOW, HAVE WE EVER
19:25:45  ALLOWED MIXED 
USE COMMERCIAL TO SHARE SPACE 
WITH ZERO
19:25:48  ADDITIONAL UNITS 
COMING
19:25:51  FROM THE COMMERCIAL SIDE?

19:26:02 >> Planner Pullen:   I WOULD SAY 
SO LET ME STEP IN
19:26:05  HERE MARC.
IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THE 
SPACES ARE
19:26:08  NOT ASSIGNED SO THERE 
IS NOT A ZERO NUMBER FOR
19:26:10  THE 
COMMERCIAL UNITS.
IS.

19:26:18 >> CORRECT, UNBUNDLED
19:26:21 ED UNASSIGNED 
SPACES.
>> Commissioner McDonald:   I'M 

19:26:24 ALWAYS FOR MINIMIZE THE PARKING.
HOWEVER YOU HAVE EIGHT UNITS OF 
HOUSING AND
19:26:27  IT'S VERY LIKELY, 
YOU KNOW WE'RE IN CALIFORNIA
19:26:30 , 
THERE'S GOING TO BE A MINIMUM OF 
16 CARS.

19:26:36 SO WHAT HAPPENS IF THOSE
19:26:41  
PEOPLE -- AND I'M GOING TO PLAY 
DEVIL'S ADVOCATE HERE
19:26:44  BUT YOU 
JUST SHOWED ME ALL THAT PUBLIC 
TRANSIT THAT YOU
19:26:47  THINK IS GOING 
TO EXIST.
WHAT IN THEY ALL LEAVE
19:26:50  THEIR 
CARS AT HOME AND TAKE THE BUS
19:26:53 ?

19:27:00 WHAT HAPPENS TO THE COMMERCIAL 
PEOPLE WHO ARRIVE IN THE MORNING 
AND
19:27:03  HAVE ZERO SPACES?

19:27:12 THAT WOULD BE LIKE THE BEST-CASE 
SCENARIO OF WHAT WE'RE
19:27:15  LOOKING 
FOR, WE'RE REDUCING THE AMOUNT 
OF PARKING BECAUSE WE BELIEVE
19:27:18  
THAT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE 
USING THE MASS TRANSIT
19:27:23 .
19:27:31 
I DIDN'T SEE IN 32 AREA ANYPLACE 
WHERE YOU COULD PARK
19:27:34  YOUR CAR 
AND WALK IT INTO THAT LOT.
ESPECIALLY
19:27:38  BECAUSE THERE WEREN'T 
SIDEWALKS GOING SOUTH OR
19:27:41  GOING 
TOWARDS THE HIGHWAY.

19:28:05 >> Commissioner Yee:   GO AHEAD 
JOEL.
 , LOST YOU.
19:28:07 
>> Planner Pullen:   IS IT BAD 
QUALITY?

19:28:10 >> Commissioner McDonald:   NO 
WE CAN HEAR YOU NOW
19:28:13 .
>> Planner Pullen:   SO THE 
QUESTION IS, WHAT IF PEOPLE
19:28:16  HAVE 
CARS THAT THEY DECIDE TO LEAVE 
AT THE SITE?

19:28:19 AND THE PROPERTY OWNER CAN 
MANAGE PARKING.
19:28:22 
AND AS AN HOA I WOULD EXPECT 
THAT THEY WOULD.

19:28:28 TO PREVENT MORE CARS THAN CAN BE 
HANDLED
19:28:31 .
YOU'RE RIGHT, THAT IN A LOT OF 
PARTS OF
19:28:34  FREMONT THE SUBURBAN, 
YOU KNOW,
19:28:37  TYPICAL MODEL IS THAT, 
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE WHO
19:28:41  LIVE IN 
FREMONT MAY HAVE TWO CARS
19:28:44  VERY 
COMMONLY.
WE'RE GETTING INTO A
19:28:48  NEWER 
DEVELOPMENT,
19:28:55  RHNA WHERE PARKING 
HAS TO BE REDUCED
19:28:58 .
IF YOU BUILD PARKING PEOPLE WILL 
PUSH
19:29:01  PARKING TO THE
19:29:04  MAXIMUM.
AS WE GO FORWARD THE
19:29:07  TREND TO 
REDUCE PARKING AND TO
19:29:11  THEREBY 
INCREASE TRANSIT USE SO WE HAVE 
CHOICES RELATED TO GIVING
19:29:14  THESE 
PEOPLE CHOICES TO PICK ONE OR 
THE OTHER.

19:29:17 >> Commissioner McDonald:   SO 
JOEL, THE OTHER ISSUE THAT I SAW 
HERE IS
19:29:20  THAT WE MAKE NO 
PROVISION FOR THESE ARE
19:29:23  UNITS 
THAT ARE THREE RECEIPT CLI FOR 
19:29:26  THEY RECEIPT
19:29:33  THEORETICALLY FOR
19:29:36  
FAMILIES.
THESE SCHOOLS ARE
19:29:39  TOO FAR TO 
WALK TO, WHICH
19:29:43  MEANS THE CARS 
ARE GOING TO BE DRIVEN, IN AND
19:29:45  
OUT MIDDAY AND MULTIPLE TIMES A 
DAY.

19:29:52 >> Planner Pullen:   SOUNDS LIKE 
YOU HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE 
AMOUNT OF PARKING
19:29:55 .
>> Commissioner McDonald:   YES.

19:30:00 >> Commissioner Yee:   LET'S 
LEAVE IT AT THAT.
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO ALSO
19:30:03  GET 
INTO A WHOLE DELIBERATION HERE.
I WANTED TO TRY TO KEEP
19:30:06  THIS TO 
ANY QUESTIONS THAT ARE ASKED, 
YOU KNOW,
19:30:09  FROM THE INFORMATION 
THAT WAS PROVIDED BY MARC.
19:30:12 
LET'S HOLD OFF FOR THE 
DELIBERATIONS BECAUSE WE'RE 

19:30:16 GOING TO HAVE PLENTY OF TIME FOR 
THAT.
SO LET'S, IF
19:30:19  EVERYONE'S ALL 
RIGHT, I WANT TO HAVE THE 
APPLICANT TO BE ABLE
19:30:22  TO PRESENT 
THEIR INFORMATION.
AND THEY HAVE TEN
19:30:26  MINUTES TO 
PRESENT THEIR INFORMATION ABOUT
19:30:29  
THIS PROJECT.
SO I NEED TO HAVE THE TIMER UP.
19:30:32 
IF NOT, THEN MY BACKUP TIMER IS 
GOING TO BE ON.

19:30:38 OKAY.
SO THE APPLICANT IS HERE.
I KNOW YOU'RE HERE.

19:30:41 SO I GUESS YOU COULD START 
SPEAKING
19:30:44 .
>> GOOD EVENING, MY NAME
19:30:47  IS KURT 
HERALD, I'M
19:30:50  WITH HERALD 
ARCHITECTS.
WE'VE BEEN PRACTICE
19:30:53  PRACTICING IN THE 
CITY OF FREMONT ABOUT 36 YEARS 
NOW
19:30:57 .
IN FACT OUR OFFICE OPENED IN 
FREMONT, WE WERE
19:31:00  AT MISSION AND 
STEVENSON FOR 16 YEARS.
19:31:03 
WE KNOW FREMONT PRETTY WELL AND 
ENJOY THE TOWN
19:31:06  IMMENSELY.
I THINK MARC DID A PRETTY GOOD 
EXPLANATION OF THE
19:31:10  PROJECT.
WE HAVE A TWO PROFESSIONAL
19:31:13  
OFFICE BUILDINGS OUT IN THE 
FRONT
19:31:16  PART OF THE PROSTITUTE 
WITH A RESIDENTIAL UNIT ELEMENT
19:31:19  
IN THE BACK WITH PARKING BELOW.

19:31:22 WE WORKED FOR MANY YEARS WITH 
THE STAFF AND FIRE AND TRASH
19:31:25  TO 
GET -- TO TAKE ALL THESE PUZZLE 
PIECES AND ALL
19:31:28  THE CIRCULATION, 
I GUESS,
19:31:32  ISSUES AND DIMENSIONS 
AND TRY TO GET THEM ALL TO WORK.

19:31:36 AND SO WE DO HAVE A VERY GOOD
19:31:39  
SOLUTION FOR A PIECE OF PROPERTY 
LIKE THIS.
19:31:42 
I THINK I WANT -- I THINK IT'S 
IMPORTANT FOR ME TO
19:31:45  CORRECT 
MARC, MARC HELP ME OUT HERE,
19:31:48  WE 
HAVE -- WE'RE
19:31:52  REQUIRED 19 
PARKING SPACES FOR
19:31:56  THIS -- FOR 
THIS PROPERTY.
AND WE PROVIDE 15.
19:31:59 
SO WE'RE REALLY ONLY DEFICIENT 
FOUR
19:32:02  SPACES.
SO THOSE ARE THE SPACES THAT 
WE'RE TRYING TO SHARE.

19:32:05 I THINK IN MARC'S LITTLE 
EQUITIES
19:32:08  PRESENTATION HE
19:32:11  
PRESENTATION HE HAD 23 PARK
19:32:14 ING 
SPACES REQUIRED.
BUT ON THE PROJECT DATA SHEET ON
19:32:17  
SHEET A-1 IT CALCULATES IT ALL 
OUT.

19:32:20 EACH UNIT, EACH TWO-
19:32:23 BEDROOM UNIT 
IS REQUIRED TO HAVE 1.5 SPACE
19:32:26 S 
PER UNIT.
SO EIGHT SPACES IS 12 UNITS.

19:32:29 AND THEN WE HAVE THREE 
ADDITIONAL SPACES
19:32:34 .
AND I'M OFTEN FOR
19:32:37  OPEN FOR ANY OTHER 
QUESTIONS.
19:32:40 
I THINK MARC DESCRIBED THE 
PROJECT VERY WELL.

19:32:43 IF THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS I'LL 
BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY 
QUESTIONS
19:32:46 .
YEAH.
>> Commissioner Yee:   WELL, 

19:32:49 THANK YOU.
ANY CLARIFYING QUESTIONS
19:32:52  FROM 
THE COMMISSION?
FORTUNATELY,
19:32:55  I'M NOT GOING TO BE 
ABLE TO SEE THE WHOLE SCREEN 
HERE
19:32:58  IF ANYBODY PUTS MAYOR HANDS 
UP
19:33:01  THEIR HANDS 
UP
19:33:03 .
NOBODY?
ALL RIGHT.

19:33:06 I WANT TO INVITE THE PUBLIC.
NOW IS THE TIME FOR --
19:33:09  WE'RE 
GOING TO TAKE PUBLIC COMMENTS ON 
THIS AGENDA ITEM.
19:33:13 
SO TRISH ARE THERE ANY RAISED 
HANDS FOR THIS ITEM
19:33:16  FROM THE 
PUBLIC?
>> I --
19:33:19  CHAIR YEE, YES, WE DO 
HAVE A HAND RAISED
19:33:22  FROM THE 
PUBLIC.
SO I WILL GO AHEAD AND
19:33:26  INTRODUCE 
THE FIRST PERSON.
AND WE DO
19:33:29  HAVE TWO HANDS.
OKAY
19:33:33 ?
ACTUALLY WE HAVE THREE
19:33:34  HANDS 
NOW.
>> Commissioner Yee:   TWO 

19:33:37 MINUTES WILL BE FINE.
>> TWO MINUTES.
OKAY I'LL
19:33:40  START WITH THE FIRST 
PERSON.
SO ANDRE
19:33:44 AS CADA
19:33:47 NAVICH PLEASE GO 
AHEAD AND SPEAK.

19:33:52 >> Commissioner Yee:   OH, THERE 
YOU GO.
>> SORRY, THERE WAS A
19:33:55  SLIGHT 
DELAY WHEN I TRIED TO UNMUTE 
MYSELF,
19:33:58  HI, ANDREA C
19:34:01 ADANAVICH
19:34:04  
WITH BIKE FREMONT.
I HAD SOME CONCERNS WITH THE
19:34:08  
PLAN, IN PARTICULAR THE SECURITY 
OF THE LONG
19:34:11  TERM BIKE PARKING 
SPACES.
DOES
19:34:14  NOT SEEM TO MEET THE 
REQUIREMENTS FOR RESIDENTIAL 
LONG TERM BIKE
19:34:17  PARKING.
I'M GOING TO QUOTE
19:34:21  FROM THE AP 
BP BICYCLE PARK
19:34:24 ING GUIDELINES.
LONG TERM BIKE PARKING SECURITY
19:34:27 , 
SECURED OR ACTIVE SURVEILLANCE.
19:34:30 
IF IN AN UNSUPERVISED LOCATION
19:34:34 , 
EXAMPLES ARE INDIVIDUALS SECURE,
19:34:37  
BICYCLE LOCKERS OR SHARED 
SECURE, SUCH AS BICYCLE
19:34:41  ROOM OR 
CAGE?
IF I WANT TO PUT THIS IN LAYMEN
19:34:44 
LAYMEN'S TERMS BASICALLY IT 
MEANS YOU WANT TO HAVE
19:34:47  YOUR BIKE 
BEHIND A LOCKED DOOR.
IF YOU ARE GOING TO LEAVE
19:34:50  YOUR 
BIKE OVERNIGHT EVERY DAY OF THE 
YEAR JUST LIKE A $
19:34:54 40 BIKE LOCK 
SECURED TO A RACK IS NOT GOING 
TO CUT IT.
19:34:57 
AND IT LOOKED FROM THE PLANS 
LIKE THE PARKING AREA
19:35:00  IS NOT 
PHYSICALLY SECURED FROM ACCESS.
SO ANYBODY COULD WALK IN
19:35:03  AT 2 
A.M., WITH A BOLT
19:35:06  CUTTER, CUT 
19:35:10  
THROUGH THE BIKE RACK, TAKE YOUR 
BIKE
19:35:14 .
THAT DOES NOT REALLY MEET THE 
REQUIREMENTS
19:36:12 LISA YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND SPEAK.
>> THANK YOU.
SORRY
19:36:15  MY COMPUTER IS SLOW.
YEAH, I'M IN FAVOR OF
19:36:18  HAVING 
LESS PARKING.
I'VE HEARD THE
19:36:21  CONCERNS FROM THE 
COMMISSION ABOUT
19:36:29  NOT HAVING 
ENOUGH PARKING BUT IF WE WANT TO 
CLIMATE HE FRND
19:36:32 LY FUTURE 
ACKNOWLEDGE WE KNOW THAT WHEN 
PARK
19:36:36 ING IS MORE AVAILABLE PEOPLE 
OWN MORE CARS AND DRIVE MORE
19:36:39 .
SO I WOULD BE IN FAVOR OF
19:36:41  
KEEPING A LOWER AMOUNT OF 
PARKING.

19:36:44 THANK YOU.
>> Commissioner Yee:   GREAT, 
THANK YOU
19:36:47 .
TRISH, THE NEXT SPEAKER.
>> YES, OKAY.

19:36:50 WE HAVE ANOTHER SPEAKER AND THIS 
SPEAKER'S CALLING IN
19:36:54 .
SO PHONE NUMBER 6
19:36:57 56-1365.
I DID RECEIVE
19:37:00  AN E-MAIL AND I 
BELIEVE THIS IS
19:37:04  ALICE CAVETTE, 
SO WE'RE NOW GOING TO PROMOTE 
YOU TO SPEAK
19:37:08 .
GO AHEAD AND SPEAK PLEASE.
>> THANK YOU,
19:37:11  THIS IS ALICE 
CAVETTE.

19:37:14 CHRIS CAVETTE
19:37:17  WILL BE CALLING 
FROM THE SAME NUMBER.
>> THANK YOU.

19:37:20 >> ALL THE PROBLEMS FROM THIS 
PROJECT ARISE FROM IT BEING
19:37:23  A 
TINY ONE-THIRD ACRE LOT.
IT'S IN THE MIDDLE
19:37:26  OF 
APPROXIMATELY 15 ACRES ON THE 
CORNER OF DECOTO
19:37:29  AND FREMONT 
THAT IS DESIGNATED FOR MIXED USE 
DEVELOPMENT
19:37:32  IN THE GENERAL PLAN.
BUILDING THIS
19:37:36  SMALL PROJECT 
WOULD NEGATE
19:37:39  THE POSSIBILITY OF 
A PLAN WELL
19:37:42  ORGANIZED COMPLEX ON 
THIS CORNER.
THE TWO SMALL ONE-
19:37:45 STORY 
COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS ON DECOTO 
WOULD MOST LIKELY
19:37:48  SHARPLY 
CONTRAST WITH ANY
19:37:51  FUTURE LARGER 
MIXED USE COMPLEXITY OF FOUR
19:37:54  OR 
FIVE STORIES SURROUNDING IT.
EIGHT UNITS IS JUST TOO FEW
19:37:58  TO 
EASILY PROVIDE ANY AFFORDABLE 
HOUSING
19:38:01 .
THE PLAN IS TO PAY IN-LIEU FEES
19:38:05 .
FIRE ACCESS IS TIGHT.
COMMON OPEN SPACE IS LIMITED
19:38:09  TO 
INSIDE THE FOURTH FLOOR.

19:38:12 FREMONT SHARED PARKING RULES ARE 
MEANT FOR MUCH LARGER PROJECTS
19:38:16  
LIKE BAY ROCK WITH MANY 
RESIDENTIAL UNITS TO
19:38:19  BETTER 
SHARE AVAILABLE SPACES
19:38:22 .
A LOT MORE BUT I THOUGHT I
19:38:25  WAS 
HAVING THREE MINUTES.
THE APPLICANT DOES NOT,
19:38:28  AS THE 
RULE SAYS, SHOW THAT
19:38:32  THERE IS NO 
SUBSTANTIAL CONFLICT DURING THE
19:38:35  
PRINCIPAL OPERATING HOURS TO 
JUSTIFY JOINT USE PARKING
19:38:40 .
PLEASE SAY NO TO THE SHARED 
PARKING
19:38:44  AND DISAPPROVE THIS 
APPLICATION.

19:38:50 >> Commissioner Yee:   ALL 
RIGHT, THANK YOU ALICE.
AND I KNOW CHRIS
19:38:53  --
>> I STILL HAVE A MINUTE.
I CUT THIS PART
19:38:57  OUT BECAUSE I 
DIDN'T THINK I HAD ENOUGH TIME.
THE
19:39:00  EIGHT, 1600 SQUARE FOOT 
CONDOS ARE NOT
19:39:03  SMALL APARTMENTS 
WHERE FEW DRIVERS MIGHT RESIDE.

19:39:06 ALL 16 SPACES IN THE GARAGE WILL 
BE NEEDED AND WANTED BY THE
19:39:09  
RESIDENTS WHO PAY MARKET RATE 
PRICES.

19:39:12 THEY'LL PROBABLY WANT 16 
ASSIGNED SPACES.
THE
19:39:15  TWO COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS ARE 
GOING TO REQUIRE AT LEAST
19:39:19  FOUR 
FULL TIME SPACES FOR EMPLOYEES 
AND TWO OTHERS
19:39:22  FOR CLIENTS.
15 SPACES IS
19:39:25  JUST TOO FEW, 
SHARED OR NOT
19:39:28 .
>> Commissioner Yee:   ALL 
RIGHT, ALICE YOUR TIME IS UP.

19:39:31 I KNOW THE TIMER THAT'S UP HERE 
IS INCORRECT.
19:39:35 
>> OKAY, HERE IS CHRIS
19:39:38 .
>> GOOD EVENING.
MY NAME ASK
19:39:42  CHRIS CAVETTE AND I 
LIVE IN FREMONT.
ALL MIXED
19:39:45  USE DEVELOPMENTS ARE 
REQUIRED TO PROVIDE ALL PARKING
19:39:48  
ONSITE IN A DESIGNATED SPACE OR 
AREA UNLESS
19:39:51  IT CAN BE SHOWN THAT 
EITHER STREET PARKING OR
19:39:55  SHARED 
PARKING ARE FEASIBLE.
IN THIS CASE THERE IS
19:39:58  NO STREET 
PARKING OR ANY OTHER PUBLIC 
PARKING ANYWHERE IN THE AREA
19:40:01  SO 
THAT'S NOT AN OPTION.
AS FOR THE SHARED PARK
19:40:04 ING PLAN 
BEING PROPOSED, THE APPLICANT IS 
OFFERING
19:40:08  THE JUSTIFICATION THAT 
THE RESIDENTS WILL BE AT WORK 
DURING THE DAY,
19:40:11  SO THE 
COMMERCIAL EMPLOYEES AND 
CUSTOMERS CAN PARK IN
19:40:15  SOME OF 
THE RESIDENTIAL SPACES AND THE 
OTHER WAY AROUND AT NIGHT.
19:40:18 
BUT BASED ON THE GROWING NEED 
FOR MANY PEOPLE TO WORK AT HOME, 

19:40:21 AND ON THE MANY VARIATIONS IN 
WORKING HOURS, I DO
19:40:24  NOT BELIEVE 
THAT JUSTIFICATION IS TRUE 
ANYMORE.

19:40:27 WORK HOURS AND WORK LOCATIONS 
HAVE CHANGED.
AND I
19:40:31  BELIEVE THEY WILL STAY 
THAT WAY FOR MANY YEARS INTO THE
19:40:34  
FUTURE, AS COMPANIES FIND 
THERE'S A MORE
19:40:37  EFFICIENT WAY TO 
DO BUSINESS.

19:40:41 THE MINIMUM OVERALL PARKING 
REQUIREMENT FOR
19:40:44  THIS DEVELOPMENT 
WOULD BE 23 SPACES BUT THE 
APPLICANT IS PROPOSING
19:40:48  TO 
PROVIDE ONLY 16.
THAT'S SEVEN SPACES BELOW THE
19:40:51  
MINIMUM, WITH NO ALTERNATIVE 
PARK
19:40:54 ING ANYWHERE.
NO AMOUNT OF PROPERTY OWNER 
ACTION WOULD
19:40:57  SOLVE THAT PROBLEM.
THERE SIMPLY ISN'T ANY OTHER
19:41:00  
PLACE TO PARK.
I FEEL THIS SITE IS TOO SMALL
19:41:04  TO 
ACCOMMODATE THAT AMOUNT OF 
SHARED PARKING
19:41:07  AND ALLOWING IT 
WOULD SET A BAD PRECEDENT FOR
19:41:09  
OTHER SMALL MIXED USE 
DEVELOPMENTS.

19:41:13 I ASK YOU TO PLEASE DISAPPROVE 
THIS PROPOSAL.
THANK YOU
19:41:17 .
>> Commissioner Yee:   THANK YOU 
CHRIS.

19:41:20 TRISH DO WE HAVE ANY MORE PUBLIC 
SPEAKERS
19:41:23 ?
>> CHAIRPERSON YEE, LET ME TAKE 
A LOOK.
19:41:25 
WE DO NOT HAVE ANY MORE 
SPEAKERS.

19:41:30 >> Commissioner Yee:   OKAY.
SO THEN WOULD THE
19:41:33  APPLICANT LIKE 
TO SAY ANYTHING IN CLOSING?
YOU'VE GOT UP
19:41:36  TO FIVE MINUTES.

19:41:39  TO 
SAY BASED ON WHAT WAS SHARED BY
19:41:42  
THE PUBLIC.

19:41:48 SO TRISH, I THINK -- IT'S 
EITHER,
19:41:51  OKAY, SO THERE YOU GO, 
THERE
19:41:54  YOU GO.
>> SO AM I ALLOWED TO SPEAK?
19:41:57 
>> Commissioner Yee:   YES, 
YOU'VE GOT FIVE MINUTES.

19:42:00 >> OH THANK YOU.
MR. CHAIR, COMMISSIONERS
19:42:03  AND 
STAFF MY NAME IS MOINA
19:42:06  SHAIK.
I
19:42:09  HAVE LIVED ALMOST 40 YEARS IN 
FREMONT,
19:42:14  I SERVED ON TWO 
COMMISSIONS, HARB AND HRC
19:42:17 .
FIRST I'D LIKE TO ASK A QUESTION 
OF YOU COMMISSIONER
19:42:21 S.
WHY DID THE CITY OF FREMONT 
SPEND TENSE OF THOUSANDS
19:42:24  TENS OF THOUSANDS
19:42:27  OF 
DOLLARS AND MAKE BIKE LANES AND 
CHANGE ALL
19:42:32  THE LANE STRUCTURE SO 
PEOPLE ARE
19:42:35  ENCOURAGED NOT TO 
RIDE CARS?
WHY DID YOU SPEND SO MUCH
19:42:37  MONEY 
WHEN YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT ALL 
THIS?

19:42:40 CAN I GET AN ANSWER?
OR I JUST
19:42:43  SPEAK?
>> Commissioner Yee:   YOU HAVE 
FIVE MINUTES.

19:42:54  CITY 
HAS SPENT SO MUCH MONEY AND
19:42:56  NOW, 
I MEAN WHAT JOEL WAS SAYING 
EARLIER, I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH
19:42:59  
HIM, THAT WE HAVE TO PUSH THE 
ENVELOPE.

19:43:02 IF WE CONTINUE TO PROVIDE 
PARKING SPACE
19:43:06 S FOR, LIKE, WHAT 
YOU GUYS ARE SAYING FOR
19:43:09  EACH 
UNIT, TWO SPACES, WE'RE NOT 
ENCOURAGE
19:43:12 ING PEOPLE TO STOP 
RIDING IN THEIR CARS.
WE ARE TELLING
19:43:15  THEM, HEY, BRING 
MORE CARS INTO THE CITY AND WE
19:43:18  
HAVE PLENTY OF PARKING FOR YOU.
SO I'M NOT
19:43:21  SURE.
THIS IS A MIXED MESSAGE THAT THE 
CITY OF FREMONT
19:43:25  IS SENDING TO 
THE COMMUNITY.
AND I THINK YOU
19:43:27  NEED TO GET IT 
STRAIGHT.
THANK YOU.

19:43:30 THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SAY.
>> Commissioner Yee:  
19:43:33  OKAY.
19:43:37 
>> THIS IS SALEE
19:43:40 ALIM MAS
19:43:44 TAN.
WE ARE BUILDING THIS
19:43:47  PROJECT FOR 
OURSELVES.
19:43:50 
THERE ARE ONLY TWO ABOVE 50.
WE ARE NOT SENIORS
19:43:53  AND DON'T 
NEED A LOT OF CARS.
A LOT OF
19:43:57  US CAN'T DRIVE, I'M 74.
SO MANY OF US ARE
19:44:00  JUST TOO OLD 
TO DRIVE.
YOU MAKE
19:44:03  BUILDING THIS COMPLEX 
SO ALL OF US CAN LIVE
19:44:07  TOGETHER 
INSTEAD OF GOING AND LIVING IN
19:44:10  
AN ASSISTED OR DAYCARE OR WHAT 
HAVE YOU.

19:44:13 WE ARE RETIRED BUSINESS PEOPLE.
ALL OF US HAVE LIVED
19:44:16  IN FREMONT 
NEARLY 40 TO 45 YEARS
19:44:20 .
SO WE ARE NOT TRYING TO HAVE 
LIKE A
19:44:24  YOUNG COLLEGE CAMPUS 
THERE.
WE
19:44:27  ARE OLD PEOPLE.
WE WANT THESE HOMES, THESE
19:44:30  
APARTMENTS FOR OURSELVES.
AND THOSE
19:44:33  TWO OFFICE BUILDINGS, 
OFFICE, SMALL OFFICE
19:44:37  BUILDINGS, 
WE WOULD LIKE TO USE THEM FOR
19:44:40  
OUR OWN SELVES, WE ARE 
CONSULTANTS, WE
19:44:43  ARE ENGINEERS, 
WE HAVE WORKED PRACTICALLY
19:44:47  
EVERYBODY KNOWS US ON A 
ONE-TO-ONE
19:44:50  BASIS.
SO WE HAVE
19:44:53  SPENT FOUR YEARS ON 
THIS PROJECT SO THAT WE CAN 
RETIRE IN
19:44:56  FREMONT, IN HOMES THAT 
COOKS CAN COME AND
19:44:59  COOK OUR 
FOOD, CLEAN OUR PLACES AND ALL 
OF THIS
19:45:03 .
IT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT WE WANT 
TO MAKE AND SELL IT OUT FOR
19:45:06  
PROFIT OR SOMETHING.
IT IS FOR OUR OWN PERSONAL USE
19:45:10 .
AND WE HAVE HIRED THE BEST
19:45:13  
ARCHITECT OF FREMONT,
19:45:16  MR. KURT, 
TO HANDLE OUR CASE.
AND THIS IS
19:45:19  WHAT IT IS ALL 
ABOUT.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
19:45:23  WHY YOU FEEL 
AT OUR AGE WOULD
19:45:26  NEED TWO CARS 
OR ONE CAR, WHERE, AFTER
19:45:30  YOU 
CROSS 72, 73, 74, YOU CAN'T
19:45:32  EVEN 
DRIVE.
SO PLEASE UNDERSTAND WHAT WE ARE 

19:45:35 TRYING TO DO.
AND
19:45:38  REGARDING THE REAGAN LIBRARY
19:45:41  
I MEAN THE REAGAN NURSERY, THERE 
IS A CREEK BETWEEN
19:45:45  THIS PROPERTY 
AND THE REAGAN.
SO THEN
19:45:48  YOU CANNOT ANYTHING 
THERE, BECAUSE
19:45:51  IT IS AN ALAMEDA 
COUNTY CREEK, WHATEVER IT IS 
CALLED, AND
19:45:54  NOTHING CAN BE DONE 
BETWEEN REAGAN AND OUR
19:45:58  LOT.
AND THEN THERE ARE THREE 
COMMERCIAL
19:46:01  BUILDINGS WITH A GAS 
STATION ON THE END OF FREMONT
19:46:04  
BOULEVARD AND DECOTO.
SO THERE ARE THREE OF THOSE
19:46:07  
BUILDINGS.
SO IF THE NOTION THAT COMES THAT
19:46:10  
SAYS THAT REAGAN NURSERY HAS TO 
EXPAND, ALL
19:46:13  OF THESE BUILDINGS 
WILL HAVE TO BE TORN DOWN TO 
MAKE
19:46:17  IT INTO BIGGER LOT AND THE 
PEOPLE WHO TRIED THE MAKE
19:46:20  THAT 
REAGAN
19:46:24  NURSERY INTO
19:46:28  A COMPLEX --
>> Commissioner Yee:   20 
SECONDS LEFT
19:46:31 .
>> INTO A COMPLEX, THEY HAVE 
BEEN APPROACHING
19:46:34  THE CITY 
MULTIPLE TIMES TO MAKE THAT 
COMPLEX
19:46:37 .
AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND ANYTHING 
MORE ABOUT THEM
19:46:40  BUT THIS IS ONLY
19:46:43  
FOR RESIDENTS OF FREMONT WHO 
HAVE LIVED IN FREMONT AND MADE
19:46:46  
FREMONT THE HAPPIEST PLACE ON 
EARTH.

19:46:48 THANK YOU.
>> Commissioner Yee:   ALL 
RIGHT, THANK YOU.

19:47:07 >> HI, THIS IS KURT HERALD, I 
JUST HAVE
19:47:10  ONE COMMENT --
>> Commissioner Yee:   YOU 
ALREADY HAD YOUR FIVE MINUTES.

19:47:13 SO RIGHT NOW, I'M GOING TO -- 
WITH ALL OF
19:47:16  THAT I'M THEN GOING 
TO GO AHEAD AND CLOSE THE
19:47:20  PUBLIC 
HEARING FOR THIS --
>> Commissioner Daulton: 
19:47:23   COULD 
I ASK ONE QUESTION OF THE 
APPLICANT?
19:47:26 
>> Commissioner Yee:   YEAH, 
WE'RE GOING TO GO FOR THE Q&A 

19:47:29 FOR THE COMMISSION TO ASK 
CLARIFYING QUESTIONS.
SO LET ME BRING
19:47:32  IT BACK AND THEN 
ASK ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY
19:47:35  HAVE 
OF STAFF AND IN THIS CASE YOU
19:47:38  
WANT TO ASK THE APPLICANT.
SO COMMISSIONER DAULTON.
19:47:40 
>> Commissioner Daulton:   THANK 
YOU, CHAIRMAN YEE.

19:47:43 SO THE APPLICANT WAS TALKING
19:47:47  
ABOUT THIS PROJECT AS IF
19:47:51  IT WAS 
GOING TO BE FOR OLDER RESIDENTS.
I WOULD LIKE
19:47:54  TO HEAR A 
COMMITMENT FROM THE APPLICANT
19:47:57  
NOW THAT HE WILL DEED-RESTRICT 
ALL
19:48:00  THESE UNITS TO SENIOR 
CITIZENS
19:48:04 .
IN PERPETUITY.

19:48:11 WOULD YOU DO THAT?
WOULD YOU DEED-RESTRICT
19:48:15  THIS 
PROPERTY TO SENIORS
19:48:18 ?
19:48:28 
I'M ASKING IF YOU WILL 
DEED-RESTRICT THIS
19:48:31  PROPERTY TO 
SENIORS.
DO YOU UNDERSTAND
19:48:35  NEW QUESTION 
SIR?
>> YOU'RE MUTE
19:48:38 ED.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   I'M 
MUTE
19:48:41 ED?
CAN YOU HEAR --
>> NO, THE APPLICANT IS
19:48:44  MUTED.
CAN YOU UNMUTE YOUR
19:48:48  DEVICE?
>> THERE WE GO
19:48:51 .
>> Commissioner Daulton:   DO 
YOU UNDERSTAND MY QUESTION
19:48:53 ?
SIR?
I'M TALKING TO THE APPLICANTS 

19:48:56 NOW.
DO YOU UNDERSTAND MY QUESTION?

19:49:00 CAN YOU GUYS HEAR ME?
19:49:05 
>> THIS IS KURT HERALD
19:49:08  AGAIN.
I DON'T THINK IT'S REASONABLE
19:49:11  TO 
PUT DEED RESTRICTIONS ON THE 
PIECE OF PROPERTY.

19:49:14 THAT'S NOT REALLY WHAT WE'RE 
TALKING ABOUT.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   OKAY
19:49:17 .
>> IN MY LITTLE WORLD HERE BASED 
ON WHAT
19:49:20  WE'VE HEARD IS THAT 
WE'VE GOT 19 SPACES REQUIRED.
PARK
19:49:24 ING SPACES REQUIRED.
WE HAVE 15 SPACES PROVIDED
19:49:27 .
>> Commissioner Daulton:   I'M 
NOT TALKING ABOUT THAT RIGHT 

19:49:30 NOW.
I WAS COMMENTING ON YOUR
19:49:34  
COLLEAGUE'S ASSERTION THAT THIS 
WAS GOING TO BE A PROJECT
19:49:37  FOR 
ELDERLY PEOPLE.
AND IF IT IS, I
19:49:40  ADVISE YOU TO 
DEED-RESTRICT IT AND
19:49:43  WE WILL 
TREAT IT AS SUCH.
IF IT'S NOT THEN IT'S NOT
19:49:47 .
THAT'S ALL.
>> IT'S NOT.
19:49:48 
>> Commissioner Daulton:   THANK 
YOU.

19:49:51 >> Commissioner Yee:   AND 
COMMISSIONER STECKLER I SEE
19:49:53  YOUR 
HAND UP.
>> Commissioner Steckler:   YES, 

19:49:56 I HAD ANOTHER QUESTION FOR THE 
APPLICANT.
YOU KNOW HE'S
19:50:00  ASKING FOR A 
SIGNIFICANT WAVER, IN MY
19:50:03  VIEW, 
AROUND THE PARKING AND MAKING 
SUM ASSUMPTION
19:50:06 S THAT I'M NOT 
SURE ARE GOING TO HOLD WATER IN 
THE FUTURE
19:50:10 .
BUT WE DID GET, I THINK THE
19:50:13  
ENTIRE COMMISSION GOT THE E-MAIL
19:50:17  
FROM BIKE FREMONT THAT
19:50:20  I THOUGHT 
WAS WELL RESEARCHED AND WELL 
WRITTEN
19:50:23 .
AND I WANT TO KNOW IF THE
19:50:26  
APPLICANT WOULD BE WILLING TO 
MEET WITH THIS GROUP
19:50:29 , OR READ 
THIS DOCUMENT AND MAKE THE
19:50:33  
ADJUSTMENTS FOR THE BICYCLES.

19:50:41 >> YES, SO COMMISSIONER,
19:50:44  LAST 
NIGHT OR YESTERDAY AFTERNOON WE 
GOT THAT E-MAIL ALSO.
19:50:47 
GOT FORWARDED TO ME.
AND SO I ACTUALLY KIND OF DUG
19:50:50  
INTO IT FIRST THING THIS
19:50:53  MORNING 
AND HAD A CONVERSATION WITH THE 
STAFF PLANNER
19:50:56  MR. MARC 
CLEVELAND.
AND HE
19:50:59 , FIRST OF ALL THE PROJECT 
IS CONDITIONED
19:51:04  SO -- CURRENTLY 
CONDITIONED THAT WE WOULD
19:51:07  SUPPLY 
WITH THE BIKE ORDINANCES AND THE 
MASTER
19:51:10  PLANS ANYWAY.
IS A REGARDLESS
19:51:13 SO REGARDLESS WE ARE ALREADY IN
19:51:16  
AGREEMENT THAT IF THE PROJECT IS 
APPROVED THAT IT WILL BE 

19:51:19 CONDITIONED THAT WE WOULD MEET 
THOSE REQUIREMENTS.
AND SO
19:51:23  MY CONVERSATION WITH MARC 
CLEVELAND IS
19:51:26 , WE HAD -- THERE IS 
A HANDFUL OF SOLUTIONS THAT WE
19:51:30  
CAN WORK OUT WITH THE STAFF TO
19:51:33  
19:51:36  
MAKE EVERYTHING GOOD.
JUST A LITTLE HISTORY.

19:51:39 WE'VE HAD A MINIMUM OF FIVE PRP
19:51:42  
SUBMITTALS, COMMENTS AND REVIEWS 
AND WE'VE HAD
19:51:45  TWO DESIGN REVIEW 
SUBMITTALS WITH COMMENTS AND 
REVIEWS
19:51:49 , AND NEVER, NOT ONCE, 
NEVER, NOT ONCE,
19:51:52  EVEN IN 
DISCUSSION OR IN WRITING, DID
19:51:55  
THESE COMMENTS OR THE COMMENTS 
OF CREATING
19:51:59  A LOCKED-UP ROOM OR 
LOCKERS FOR THESE
19:52:02  LONG-TERM 
BICYCLE SPACES, DID IT
19:52:05  EVER COME 
UP.
AND SO I JUST -- SO I JUST WANT 

19:52:08 TO MAKE VERY, VERY CLEAR THAT WE 
DID NOT COME INTO THIS
19:52:13  PROJECT 
THINKING OR KNOWING THAT WE WERE
19:52:16  
NOT COMPLYING WITH THE 
ORDINANCE.

19:52:20 >> Commissioner Steckler:   
WELL, I UNDERSTAND.
ABOUT I HEAR WHAT
19:52:23 I HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING
19:52:26 .
BUT IT MAY BE A VALUABLE LESSON 
THAT
19:52:29  WE BOTH LEARN THAT IN THE 
FUTURE YOU REACH OUT TO THIS
19:52:32  
GROUP WHILE YOU'RE DOING YOUR 
PLANNING
19:52:35  SO THEIR INTERESTS CAN 
POSSIBLY BE MET,
19:52:38  THAT'S ALL I'M 
SAYING.
>> AND I AGREE WITH YOU.

19:52:41 WITH THAT WOULD BE NICE, IT 
WOULD BE NICE FOR PLANNING
19:52:44  STAFF 
ALTHOUGH WE WORKED VERY CLOSELY 
WITH THEM AND VERY HARD AND
19:52:47  THEY 
WORKED VERY HARD.
IT WOULD BE NICE IF THEY COULD 

19:52:50 HAVE LET US KNOW THAT THIS GROUP 
WAS AROUND, I WOULD HAVE
19:52:54  LOVED 
TO HAVE MET WITH THEM AND 
BROUGHT OUR PRELIMINARY PLANS 

19:52:57 AND SAT DOWN AND DISCUSSED, NOT 
ONLY JUST THE
19:53:00  RULES, THE 
REGULATIONS BUT SOME OF THE 
THINGS THAT THEY'VE EXPERIENCED
19:53:03  
IN OTHER CITIES IN THE PAST.
>> Commissioner Steckler:   

19:53:06 OKAY.
>> SO WE ARE -- I JUST WANT 
AGAIN I WANT TO SAY WE'RE NOT 

19:53:10 GOING INTO THIS PROJECTS
19:53:17  PROJECT WITH THE 
INTENT OF NOT COMPLYING.
19:53:19 
>> Commissioner Steckler:   
THANK YOU, MR. CHAIR.

19:53:22 >> Commissioner Yee:   
COMMISSIONER McDONALD I SEE 
YOUR HAND RAISED.

19:53:25 >> Commissioner McDonald:   YES, 
I WANTED TO GO BACK TO -- THERE 
SEEMS TO BE AGAIN
19:53:30  THIS 
MISCOMMUNICATION ISSUE
19:53:34  WITH THE 
NUMBERS.
STAFF
19:53:37  ACCORDING TO THE
19:53:41  BREAKDOWN 
SAID THAT EACH UNIT WAS REQUIRED
19:53:46  
ONE COVERED PARK SPACE, ONE
19:53:49  HALF 
UNCOVERED PARKING SPACE AND ONE 
GUEST PARK
19:53:52 ING SPACE AND THAT'S 
HOW THEY GET
19:53:55  TO 23 WITH SEARCH 
UJTS I BELIEVE COMMERCIAL AND
19:54:02  SEVEN 
UNITS COMMERCIAL AND
19:54:05  -- SORRY 
I'VE GOT THAT WRONG.

19:54:11 BUT ANYWAY, OKAY.
BUT THE REQUIREMENT FOR THE 
RESIDENTIAL
19:54:15  IS 16 UNITS.

19:54:18 I'M NOT SURE WHERE -- HOW THE 
APPLICANT IS COMING UP
19:54:22  WITH 19 
AND MAYBE THAT MISCOMMUNICATION
19:54:25  
IS THE BASIS FOR SOME OF THIS 
CONFUSION.

19:54:28 BECAUSE THE APPLICANT IS UNDER 
THE IMPRESSION THAT
19:54:32  THEY ARE 
ONLY SHORT FOUR SPACES WHEN 
ACCORDING TO THE
19:54:35  CITY, THEY'RE 
SHORT EIGHT OR
19:54:38  SEVEN DEPENDING 
ON WHETHER OR NOT THE BIKE 
CREDIT IS APPLIED.

19:54:44 >> SO AS THE APPLICANT I'D LIKE 
TO ASK
19:54:47  MARC CLEVELAND, IF HE 
COULD KIND OF GO BACK
19:54:50  OVER THE 
PARKING REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MX 
ZONE AND THE
19:54:53  OVERLAYS IN THIS 
AREA.
>> RIGHT.

19:54:56 SO LOOKING AT THE MUNICIPAL CODE 
RIGHT NOW AS I'VE
19:54:59  GOT IT OPEN, 
IT IS FOUR.
19:55:02 
IT WOULD BE EIGHT COVERED, FOUR 
UNCOVERED
19:55:05  AND FOUR GUEST SPOTS, 
BECAUSE IT IS THE ONE
19:55:08  PER UNIT 
AND THEN .5,
19:55:11  .5.
I'M LOOKING AT YOUR PLANS AND DO 
I SEE THAT YOU
19:55:14  ARE MISSING THE 
.5 GUEST SPACE PER UNIT IN
19:55:17  YOUR 
CALCULATION.
SO THAT IS WHERE THE 

19:55:20 MISCOMMUNICATION IS COMING FROM.
>> AND JUST FOR THE RECORD, 
WE'VE ALWAYS
19:55:23  HAD THAT ON OUR 
PLANS
19:55:27 .
>> Commissioner Yee:   THE 
APPLICANT, I'M HERE TO RUN THIS
19:55:30 .
SO MARC, YOU KNOW, I WANTED TO 
ASK THE
19:55:33  SAME EXACT QUESTION.
BUT THE APPLICANT IS PRETTY MUCH
19:55:37  
DONE ASKS ANY QUESTIONS, FROM 
OUR STAFF
19:55:40 , AND THIS IS A YES 
19:55:43  
QUESTION THAT IS DIRECTED FROM 
COMMISSIONER McDONALD
19:55:46  TO MARC 
CLEVELAND.
SO THAT MARC I'M GLAD TO SEE
19:55:50  
THAT YOU'RE CLARIFYING
19:55:53  THE 
CONFUSION FOR THIS CALCULATION.
IS THERE ANYTHING YOU WOULD LIKE
19:55:56  
TO SHARE WITH US
19:56:00  AS FAR AS
19:56:05  THIS 
CALCULATION CONFUSION
19:56:09 .
MARC, YOU ARE MUTED.
>> OKAY THERE WE GO.
19:56:13 
I'D FIGURE I WOULD JOIN IN WITH 
THE REST OF
19:56:16  US IN SOLIDARITY 
NOW.
LET ME GO
19:56:19  TO MY SLIDE AND KIND 
OF SHARE IT AGAIN.
19:56:20 
>> Commissioner Yee:   THAT 
WOULD HELP.

19:56:31 I APOLOGIZE, IF YOU COULD HEAR 
MY DOG
19:56:34  IN THE BACKGROUND.

19:56:56 SO THERE, YOU CAN TAKE A LOOK.

19:57:14 >> Commissioner Yee:   
COMMISSIONER McDONALD DOES 
THAT HELP YOU?
19:57:17 
>> Commissioner McDonald:   I 
CAN SEE IF I WERE THE APPLICANT 

19:57:20 EXPECTING TO COME IN HERE BEING 
SHORT ONLY TWO SPACE AND TO FIND 
OUT
19:57:23  THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY 
SHORT -- YOU
19:57:27  KNOW, 16, 23, SEVEN 
SPACES.

19:57:42 >> Commissioner Yee:   OKAY, SO 
WITH THAT, ANY OTHER 
COMMISSIONERS HAVE ANY
19:57:46  OTHER 
QUESTIONS WITH THE APPLICANT?
IF NOT, I WILL THEN,
19:57:49  AGAIN, 
CLOSE THE PUBLIC HEARING AND 
THEN BRING IT
19:57:53  BACK TO US, AND
19:57:56  
ASK IF ANYONE HAS QUESTIONS OF 
STAFF, WHICH
19:58:00  IT LOOKS LIKE WE 
ALREADY HAVE.
19:58:04 
AND HAVE A DISCUSSION
19:58:07  ABOUT THIS 
PARTICULAR AGENDA ITEM.
COMMISSIONER LIU
19:58:10  I SEE YOUR HAND 
RAISED.
>> Commissioner Liu:   I HAVE A 

19:58:14 MEETING FOR -- I HAVE A QUESTION 
FOR THE STAFF.
COULD YOU PLEASE TELL
19:58:17  ME THE 
REASON WHY THERE ARE NO 
DEDICATED BIKE
19:58:21  LANES ON DECOTO 
ON THE SIDE OF
19:58:24  THE PROJECT SITE?

19:58:32 >> THAT'S SOMETHING I WOULD HAVE 
TO TALK ABOUT WITH TRAFFIC 
ENGINEERING.

19:58:35 I'M NOT SURE.

19:58:38 >> Commissioner Yee:   I 
GUESS --

19:58:42 
>> Planner Pullen:   SO WE DON'T 
HAVE PUBLIC WORKS TONIGHT.
19:58:45 
PUBLIC WORKS HAS A PROGRAM 
CITYWIDE TO PUT BIKE LANES WHERE
19:58:48  
THEY MOST SENSE, I UNDERSTAND 
THAT
19:58:52  THROUGH PRIMARY EXISTING
19:58:55  
RIGHTS OF WAY, THE PAINT AND 
PLARVEG WHERE YOU HAVE
19:58:58  AVAILABLE 
SPACE.
IT MAY HAVE TO DO WITH THE LACK
19:59:01  
OF IMPROVEMENTS ALONG THIS 
DPRONTD AN AND
19:59:05  
FRONTAGE AND OVER TIME AS THE
19:59:08  
STREET GETS BUILT OUT THOSE BIKE 
LANES WOULD BE IMPROVED.

19:59:11 WE WOULD HAVE TO GO TO THE BIKE 
MASTER PLAN
19:59:14  TO GET MORE 
SPECIFIC.
>> Commissioner Liu:   I GUESS
19:59:18  
MY FULL-UP QUESTION WOULD BE, 
HOW REALISTIC DO YOU
19:59:22  THINK IT IS 
TO EXPECT PEOPLE TO EITHER TAKE 
BIKES OR TO
19:59:25  EVEN WALK TO TRANSIT 
POINTS FROM THIS
19:59:28  SITE?
BECAUSE WHEN I VISITED THE SITE, 
I FOUND
19:59:31  NO PARKING.
AND THEN I DECIDED TO
19:59:34  PARK AT A 
GAS STATION AND ON MY WAY, 
WALKING
19:59:38  TOWARDS THE JOB SITE, I 
WAS THINKING, I PROBABLY HAVE
19:59:41  A 
50-50 CHANCE OF, YOU KNOW, 
MAKING IT BACK
19:59:44  TO MY HOME AND 
ATTEND THIS MEETING TONIGHT
19:59:48 .
THE TRAFFIC WAS REALLY SCARY TO 
ME.

19:59:53 SO I'M JUST THINKING, INDEED, 
THIS IS PROBABLY NOT
19:59:56  A VERY BIKE
19:59:59 
BIKE-FRIENDLY OR PEDESTRIAN-
20:00:02 
PEDESTRIAN-FRIENDLY S SITE
20:00:05  FOR 
PEOPLE TO NOT DRIVE.
THAT'S MY OBSERVATION.

20:00:11 >> Commissioner Yee:   ALL 
RIGHT, THANK YOU COMMISSIONER 
LIU.

20:00:14 COMMISSIONER DAULTON I SAW YOUR 
HAND RAISED AND THEN IT
20:00:16  WOULD BE 
COMMISSIONER STECKLER.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   THANK 

20:00:19 YOU, CHAIR.
CHARLES, COMMISSIONER LIU, I
20:00:23  WAS 
THERE, IF YOU LOOK AT GOOGLE 
MAPS RIGHT
20:00:26  NOW ON THE STREET 
VIEW THERE'S A DEDICATED BIKE 
LANE
20:00:29  OUT IN FRONT OF THESE 
PROPERTIES.
IT'S NOT WELL MAINTAINED
20:00:33 .
IT'S DIFFICULT TO SEE.
BUT THERE ARE BICYCLE
20:00:36  MARKINGS 
IN FRONT OF THIS PROPERTY ON 
THAT PART OF DECOTO
20:00:39 .
THAT BEING SAID, YES, IT'S A 
VERY DANGEROUS PLACE TO
20:00:42  RIDE A 
BIKE.
I'VE RIDDEN IT A FEW TIMES.
20:00:45 
I WAS COMPLETELY SINCERE 
REGARDING THE DEED RESTRICTION 

20:00:48 OF THIS PROPERTY.
I MEAN IF THE APPLICANT IS 
WILLING TO
20:00:51  EDIT-RE
20:00:55  DEED-RESTRICT EVEN A 
FEW
20:00:58  OF THESE UNITS TO SENIORS,
20:01:02  
I'D BE WILLING TO OVERLOOK THE 
PARKING ISSUE HERE TO
20:01:05  A CERTAIN 
EXTENT.
IT SOUNDS LIKE THAT'S YOUR PLAN 

20:01:08 IS TO BRING SENIORS INTO THIS 
RESIDENCE.
20:01:12 
AND I TELL YOU WE NEED THAT HERE 
IN FREMONT.
20:01:15 
WE NEED STUFF LIKE THAT.
SO, YOU KNOW, I'M HEARING A LOT 

20:01:18 OF THE COMMISSIONERS HAVING A 
BIG PROBLEM WITH THE PARKING AND 
STUFF
20:01:21  HERE.
I THINK THAT'S A BARGAINING 
POINT FOR YOU GUYS THAT YOU
20:01:24  
SHOULD CONSIDER.
20:01:28 
OTHER THAN THAT, I JUST WORRY, 
ALSO
20:01:32  LIKE COMMISSIONER 
McDONALD, REGARDING THE 
CONFUSION
20:01:36  ON THE OTHER 
HALF-SPACE REQUIREMENT HERE.

20:01:45 AND UNLESS WE GET SOME KIND
20:01:48  OF 
SATISFACTORY RESOLUTION 
REGARDING THAT, IN TERMS OF
20:01:51  
EITHER, I DON'T KNOW, LESS 
UNITS, SO THAT THEY
20:01:54  CAN PUT MORE 
PARKING THERE?
I MEAN THAT
20:01:58  WOULD BE A SOLUTION 
ALSO.
20:02:01 
OR SOME OTHER TYPE OF PARKING 
INFORMATION
20:02:05  THERE.
I CAN'T SEE ANYONE, AT THIS 
POINT IN HISTORY
20:02:09 , DEPENDING ON 
BUS TRANSIT FROM
20:02:12  THAT PLACE, 
CERTAINLY
20:02:15  NOT TO GET TO, YOU 
KNOW, STANFORD MALL
20:02:19 .
STANFORD SHOPPING CENTER.
I PRETTY MUCH GUARANTEE
20:02:22  YOU, IT 
WOULD TAKE YOU TWO HOURS TO GET 
THERE FROM POINT TO POINT
20:02:27 .
SO I'M NOT SEEING THE BUS ROUTE 
ACROSS THE BRIDGE
20:02:30  AS REALLY A 
GREAT OPPORTUNITY.
20:02:33 
MAYBE AT SOME POINT WHEN THE 
EAST
20:02:36 -WEST CONNECTOR HAPPENS, AND 
DECOTO
20:02:39  BECOMES A LITTLE MORE 
DEVELOPED, OPPORTUNITIES
20:02:43  FOR 
TRANSIT WILL PRESENT THEMSELVES.
I
20:02:46  MEAN I KNOW THAT THEY WANT TO 
PUT MAYBE SOME KIND
20:02:48  OF RAIL 
THERE.
THEY WANT TO HAVE DISCUSSION IS 

20:02:55 S 
FOR ALL SORTS OF
20:03:00  TRANSIT BUT AS 
IT
20:03:04  STANDS NOW, THIS IS A PERFECT 
PLACE TO BUY A
20:03:07  CONDOMINIUM AND 
HOP ON THE FREEWAY EVERY 
MORNING, THAT'S WHERE
20:03:10  IT'S AT, 
THAT'S WHERE IT'S GOOD FOR.
IT'S A
20:03:13  TERRIBLE PLACE TO TAKE A 
BUS ANYWHERE.
THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO
20:03:16  SAY.
>> Commissioner Yee:   THANK YOU 
COMMISSIONER DAULTON
20:03:20 .
BEFORE -- I JUST WANT TO MAKE 
SURE THAT THE APPLICANT WHO
20:03:23  HAS 
HIS HAND RAISED REALIZES THAT 
HIS TIME IS ALREADY DONE
20:03:26 .
SO YOU DO NOT HAVE AN 
OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK FURTHER.

20:03:29 IT'S RIGHT NOW JUST FOR THE 
COMMISSION.
OKAY?
20:03:32 
SO COMMISSIONER STECKLER WAS 
NEXT.

20:03:35 SO COMMISSIONER STECKLER.
>> Commissioner Steckler:   
THANK YOU CHAIR.

20:03:38 I DO HAVE A QUESTION FOR MAYBE 
IT'S JOEL.
20:03:42 
THE PROPERTY JUST EAST OF THE
20:03:45  
PROJECT SITE IS A TWO-STORY 
COMMERCIAL
20:03:48 .
USED TO BE A DENTAL OFFICE.
DO WE KNOW
20:03:51  WHAT THE PLAN IS FOR 
THAT PROPERTY THERE
20:03:56 ?
20:03:59 
IT'S FENCED OFF, IT'S UP FOR 
SALE IT LOOKS LIKE.
20:04:01 
>> Planner Pullen:   YEAH, WE'VE 
HAD AN APPLICATION ON THAT 

20:04:04 PROPERTY.
I BELIEVE THEY'RE INSTALLING AN 
ELEVATOR OR
20:04:08  MODIFYING AN 
ELEVATOR, FOR MAINTAINING AN 
OFFICE USE
20:04:12 .
IT'S RECENTLY TURNED
20:04:15  OVER, SOME 
SUITES, IS MY UNDERSTANDING BUT
20:04:18  
IT'S NOT PROPOSED TO BE REMOVED.
IT WOULD REMAIN WITH
20:04:21  SOME 
UPGRADES.
>> Commissioner Steckler:   ALL 

20:04:24 RIGHT.
THANK YOU.
>> Commissioner Yee:   ALL RIGHT
20:04:28 
RIGHT, COMMISSIONER CARDENAS.
I SEE YOUR HAND RAISED
20:04:30 .
>> Commissioner Cardenas:   YES, 
YOU KNOW I THINK TO ME ANY TIME 

20:04:34 I SIT IN ON THESE MEETINGS, YOU 
KNOW,
20:04:37  THE THEME OF TRANSPARENCY 
IS VERY IMPORTANT, RIGHT?
20:04:40 
AND WE WANT TO MAKE THE BEST 
DECISIONS BASED ON THE 

20:04:43 INFORMATION THAT YOU GUYS ARE 
PROVIDING US FOR APPLICANT.
AND I WOULD AGREE
20:04:47  WITH 
COMMISSIONER DAULTON, THAT, YOU 
KNOW, TRANSPARENCY IS VERY 

20:04:50 IMPORTANT.
SO I MEAN IF YOU ARE GOING TO 
COME OUT HERE AND SAY HEY
20:04:53 , THIS 
IS GOING TO BE DEDICATED 
EARMARKED FOR SENIORS AND
20:04:56  SENIOR 
LIVING, THEN I CAN UNDERSTAND 
WHERE THAT SPARKS
20:04:59 , LIKE, THE 
DEED
20:05:03  RESTRICTION, YOU KNOW, 
COMMITMENT TO THIS PROJECT.
SO I
20:05:06  THINK, YOU KNOW, I DON'T 
WANT TO SAY YOU
20:05:09  OPEN PANDORA'S 
BOX WHEN YOU COME OUT AND
20:05:12  YOU 
PURELY ARE SAYING THIS IS THE 
DEDICATED SPOT FOR THIS.
20:05:16 
BUT I'M WITH COMMISSIONER 
DAULTON ON THIS ONE.

20:05:19 IF YOU GUYS ARE WILLING TO 
COMMIT TO THAT
20:05:22 , THEN I'D BE MORE 
INCLINED TO VOTE FAVORABLY
20:05:26  FOR 
THIS PROJECT.
>> Commissioner Yee: 
20:05:27   ALL 
RIGHT.
THANK YOU.

20:05:30 COMMISSIONER McDONALD.
I SEE YOUR HAND RAISED AS WELL.

20:05:34 >> Commissioner McDonald:   YES.
SO I'M GOING TO GO BACK TO
20:05:38  MY 
ORIGINAL POINTS, THAT
20:05:41  THERE 
IS -- THERE WAS CONFUSION IN 
THAT THE
20:05:44  APPLICANT SEEMS TO BE 
THINKING THAT THEY'RE ONLY
20:05:47  
SHORTING US TWO SPACES.
WHEN IN REALITY, IT'S
20:05:50  MORE LIKE 
SEVEN SPACES.
AND
20:05:54  THAT -- WE HAVE NOT IN ALL 
THE YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN
20:05:57  ON THIS 
COMMISSION, EVER APPROVED
20:06:02  A 
PROJECT THAT DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH
20:06:05  
YOU SPACE FOR JUST THE 
RESIDENTIAL,
20:06:08  AND THEN
20:06:12  INTENDS TO 
SHARE THE LESS
20:06:15 -THAN-FULL AMOUNT 
WITH
20:06:18  COMMERCIAL AS WELL.
AND WITH TWO, 11
20:06:21 00 SQUARE FOOT 
COMMERCIAL UNITS
20:06:24 , ASSUMING EVEN 
IF YOU HAVE TWO OR THREE PEOPLE 
WORKING THERE
20:06:27  AT ANY GIVEN TIME 
THAT'S SIX SPACES ALL DAY
20:06:32 .
AND THAT DOESN'T ACCOUNT FOR ANY 
CUSTOMERS
20:06:35 .
SO -- AND THIS, WE HAVE ALREADY 
AGREED
20:06:38 , IS NOT A SPOT THAT'S 
WALKABLE OR REALLY BIKEABLE
20:06:42  AT 
THIS POINT.
AND CERTAINLY
20:06:45 , YOU KNOW, THE 
BUSES ARE NOT REALISTIC
20:06:47  
INTERNALLY IN FREMONT AT THIS 
POINT.

20:06:51 AND THERE'S NO PLACE TO PARK THE
20:06:55  
CAR IF YOU WANT TO PARK IT 
OFFSITE
20:06:58 .
THAT'S, I MEAN YOU WOULD HAVE TO 
WALK HALF A
20:07:01  MILE AND CROSS 
DECOTO
20:07:04  ROAD
20:07:08  AND WALK ON DEC COE 
ROAD WITH NO SIDEWALKS
20:07:11  TO GET TO 
A PLACE YOU COULD LEAVE A CAR.
I JUST
20:07:14  DON'T SEE HOW THIS NUMBER 
OF PARKING SPACES
20:07:18  CAN POSSIBLY 
ACCOMMODATE A THRIVE
20:07:20 ING 
COMMERCIAL OR RESIDENTIAL 
COMMUNITY.

20:07:23 I MEAN IF YOU HAD TO TAKE YOUR 
KID TO SCHOOL AND COME BACK
20:07:28  AND 
THEN -- I DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU 
GO IF
20:07:31  YOUR PARKING SPACES ARE 
ALL GONE
20:07:34 , FOR OTHE MULTIPLE 
TIMES THAT AS YOUNG FAMILIES
20:07:37 , 
ASSUMING WE'RE NOT 
DEED-RESTRICTED.

20:07:40 AGAIN, I AM WITH COMMISSIONER 
DAULTON.
IF WE GET
20:07:43  THIS THING DEED 
RESTRICTED THEN I COULD SEE WHAT 
POTENTIALLY
20:07:46  WE DON'T NEED THAT 
MANY PARKING SPACES.
BUT OTHERWISE,
20:07:51  IF THERE ARE EVER 
GOING TO BE REGULAR FAMILIES 
LIVING
20:07:54  IN THE 1600 SQUARE FOOT 
CONDOMINIUMS
20:07:58 , THIS IS COMPLETELY 
UNREALISTIC.

20:08:04 SO I'M GOING TO LEAVE IT
20:08:08  AT AT 
THAT.
>> Commissioner Yee:   ALL 

20:08:11 RIGHT, VICE CHAIR RAO, I SEE 
YOUR HAND RACE
20:08:15  HAND RAISED.
20:08:18 
YES, I'M IN AGREEMENT WITH KATHY
20:08:21 RRS YES,
20:08:25 >> Commissioner Rao:   YES, I'M
20:08:28  
IN AGREEMENT WITH KATHY, 
COMMISSIONER McDONALD.

20:08:31 THIS PLACE LOOKS REALLY SHABBY 
HERE, I WAS
20:08:35  ALSO WONDERING, 
COMMISSIONER DAULTON TALKED 
ABOUT SENIORS
20:08:38 .
BUT ISN'T THAT PLACE A LITTLE 
DANGEROUS FOR THE SENIORS,
20:08:42  TOO?
THAT PLACE IS SO BUSY.
20:08:45 
AND IF THE SENIORS WANT TO TAKE 
A WALK OR COME
20:08:48  OUT EVEN THAT'S 
KIND OF SCARY OUT THERE.
SO
20:08:51  SOMEHOW, I DON'T
20:08:56  SEE IF THE 
PARKING, THERE'S NO CUSHION, 
THEN
20:09:01  THERE'S I MEAN SOME 
RESIDENTS MAY NEED
20:09:04  TO WORK AT -- 
I MEAN NOWADAYS THEY WORK FROM 
HOME
20:09:07 .
SO AS EVERYONE HAS SAID, SO
20:09:11  O
20:09:14  I 
DON'T, FROM MY SIDE I KIND OF
20:09:20  OF 
CAN'T AGREE TO THIS PROPOSAL.
>> Commissioner Yee:   OKAY
20:09:23 , AS 
THE CHAIR I GUESS I'LL PUT IN MY 
TWO
20:09:27  CENTS WORTH AS WELL.
COMMISSIONER DAULTON MAKES A 
GOOD
20:09:30  POINT IF THIS WAS DEED 
RESTRICTED FOR A SENIOR,
20:09:34  THEN 
YOU WOULD HAVE A CHANCE FOR THE 
PARKING THAT'S SHARED.

20:09:37 AND AS AN AVID CYCLIST MYSELF I 
TRY
20:09:40  TO AVOID DEC COE ROAD AT ALL
20:09:43  DECOTO ROAD
20:09:46  BECAUSE 
OF ALL THE SENIORS BARRELING 
THROUGH THERE IT WOULD BE
20:09:49  
DIFFICULT.
IF PEOPLE DID PARK ON THAT 

20:09:53 STREET, TALKING TO THE PEOPLE AT 
REAGAN NURSERY
20:09:56 , TELLING ME ABOUT 
THE ACCIDENTS THAT HAVE HAPPENED 
OVER THERE
20:09:59  WITH CARS PARKED EVEN 
ON THEIR LOT, PEOPLE WOULD
20:10:03  VEER 
OFF THE MAIN ROAD AND GO RIGHT 
INTO THEIR PARKING LOT
20:10:05 .
SO I HAVE DEFINITELY ISSUES WITH 
SAFETY.

20:10:08 YOU KNOW WITH THAT SITE, 
ESPECIALLY WITH TRYING TO HAVE
20:10:11  
THIS SHARED PARKING, AND NOT 
REALLY HAVING A
20:10:14  SAFE PLACE, EVEN 
FOR SENIORS TO BE
20:10:17  ABLE TO, FOR 
INGRESS AND EGRESS.
20:10:21 
SO THOSE ARE MY TWO CENTS WORTH 
ABOUT THAT
20:10:24 .
ANY OTHER COMMISSIONERS?

20:10:28 OKAY.
COMMISSIONER DAULTON.
20:10:31 
>> Commissioner Daulton:   I 
GUESS I WAS WONDERING, FROM
20:10:34  
STAFF, IF THERE IS ANY PROJECT
20:10:37 ED 
TIME LINE FOR ADDING
20:10:40  PEDESTRIAN 
AMENITIES TO THAT PART OF 
DECOTO?

20:10:43 I MEAN, WILL --
20:10:46  WILL, AT SOME 
POINT IN THE NEAR FUTURE,
20:10:49  
SIDEWALKS BE DISCOVERED THERE
20:10:53 ?
>> Planner Pullen:   MY
20:10:56  BEST 
GUESS WOULD BE THAT THAT WOULD 
BE DEVELOPED ALONG
20:10:59  WITH THE 
CITY'S LARGER PROJECTS THAT KIND
20:11:03  
OF SURROUND THIS AREA.
IF THAT WERE TO DEVELOP SOMETIME 

20:11:06 IN THE FUTURE.
THAT THERE WAS PREVIOUSLY A
20:11:09  
PROPOSAL THAT DIDN'T GO
20:11:12  FORWARD.
THE CITY COULD TAKE IT ON
20:11:16  ITSELF 
BUT THAT WOULD BE A COST
20:11:19 LY 
PROJECT TO DO ALL
20:11:22  THE FRONTAGE 
THERE.
SO I DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER FOR
20:11:25  
YOU BEYOND THAT.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   OKAY, 

20:11:28 THANK YOU.
>> Commissioner Yee:   OKAY, ANY 
OTHER
20:11:31  QUESTIONS FROM ANY OF THE 
COMMISSIONERS?
OKAY
20:11:34 , SEEING NONE, I
20:11:37  GUESS 
THAT'S THE END OF OUR 
DELIBERATION.
20:11:41 
SO OOPS, I SEE ONE HAND.
COMMISSIONER McDONALD.

20:11:44 >> Commissioner McDonald:   I'LL 
MAKE A MOTION.
>> Commissioner Yee:   OKAY,
20:11:47  SO 
YES, YOU ALREADY BEAT ME TO THE 
PUNCH ABOUT.
20:11:50 
ANYBODY WANT TO MAKE A MOTION 
AND COMMISSIONER McDONALD, 

20:11:53 YOUR MOTION?
>> Commissioner McDonald:   I'LL 
MOVE TO DECLINE
20:11:57  THIS PROJECT 
BASED ON
20:12:02  INSUFFICIENT PARKING 
SPACES FOR THAT COMMUNITY
20:12:04 .
>> Commissioner Rao:   I SECOND 
THAT.

20:12:07 >> Commissioner Yee:   I SEE A 
SECOND FROM VICE CHAIR RAO
20:12:10 .
SO JOEL CAN YOU PLEASE CALL FOR 
THE VOTE.
20:12:15 
>> Planner Pullen:   OOPS,
20:12:22 .
 CAN'T HEAR
20:12:25  YOU JOEL.
>> Planner Pullen:   LET ME GET 
TO ANOTHER SCREEN HERE.
20:12:28 
ON A VOTE TO DENY THE PROJECT 
FOR IN
20:12:31 SUFFICIENT PARKING BECAUSE 
THE COMMISSION CAN'T MAKE 
FINDINGS FOR
20:12:35  THE SHARED PARKING 
AGREEMENT,
20:12:38  STARTING WITH IS
20:12:41  
COMMISSIONER -- CHAIRPERSON
20:12:44  YEE.
>> Commissioner Yee:   CAN YOU 
GO OVER -- SO
20:12:48  --
>> Planner Pullen:   THE MOTION.
SORRY.

20:12:50 >> Commissioner Yee:   REPEAT 
THE MOTION ONE MORE TIME.
>> Planner Pullen:   I 

20:12:54 APOLOGIZE.
THE MOTION BY COMMISSIONER 
McDONALD, SECONDED BY VICE
20:12:56  
CHAIR RAO IS TO DENY THE 
PROJECT.

20:12:59 AND I'M PARAPHRASING THE 
COMMENTARY THAT LED TO YOUR
20:13:02  
MOTION.
BASED ON ABILITY TO MAKE
20:13:05  THE 
FINDINGS FOR THE SHARED PARKING 
AGREEMENT BECAUSE
20:13:08  THERE'S 
INSUFFICIENT PARKING.
20:13:11 
AND IS THAT CORRECT, 
COMMISSIONER McDONALD?

20:13:17 >> Commissioner Yee:   OOP, 
YOU'RE MUTED.

20:13:21 >> Commissioner McDonald:   
SORRY.
TO TIE THAT THAT
20:13:28  TO THE SAFETY 
ARGUMENT, I THINK THAT'S NOT
20:13:30  
SAFE.
THE SHARED PARKING, THE GIVEN 

20:13:33 PARKING IS LAID OUT BECAUSE IT'S 
SO TIGHT, YOU WOULDN'T
20:13:36  EVEN KNOW 
YOU DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH PARKING 
TO PARK THERE UNTIL YOU ARE
20:13:39  
ALREADY IN AND IT'S PRETTY TIGHT 
IN THERE.
20:13:42 
FOR TURN AROUNDS AN EVERYTHING.
IT'S JUST THE
20:13:45  PARKING IS 
INSUFFICIENT.

20:13:50 >> Planner Pullen:   THANKS.
CHAIR, SO I WOULD APPEND
20:13:52  THE 
SAFETY COMMENT TO MY PREVIOUS 
STATEMENT ON THE MOTION.

20:13:56 SO THE MOTION IS TO DENY THE 
PROJECT ON
20:13:59  THOSE TWO FACTORS.
PLEASE VOTE.
SO A
20:14:02  VOTE AYE WOULD BE TO DENY, 
A NO VOTE WOULD BE NOT
20:14:06  TO DENY 
THE PROJECT
20:14:09 .
CHAIR YEE.
>> Commissioner Yee:   AYE
20:14:12 .
>> Planner Pullen:   VICE CHAIR 
RAO.

20:14:15 >> Commissioner Rao:   AYE.
>> Planner Pullen:   
COMMISSIONER McDONALD.

20:14:18 >> Commissioner McDonald:   AYE.
>> Planner Pullen:  
20:14:21  COMCTS.
>> Commissioner Steckler:   AYE.
20:14:26 
>> Planner Pullen:   
COMMISSIONER CARDENAS
20:14:30 ,.
>> Commissioner Cardenas:   AYE.
20:14:35 
>> Planner Pullen:   
COMMISSIONER DAULTON,.

20:14:38 >> Commissioner Daulton:   AYE.
FTC
20:14:45 >> Planner Pullen:   
COMMISSIONER LIU.
>> Commissioner Liu:   AYE.

20:14:50 >> Planner Pullen:   SO THAT
20:14:54  IS 
DENIED.

20:15:01 IS
20:15:04 
THE PLANNING COMMISSION'S ACTION
RECOMMENDATION TO COUNCIL/FINAL

20:15:06 UNLESS APPEALED TO THE CITY
COUNCIL WITHIN 10 CALENDAR DAYS.
CHAIR, BACK TO YOU.

20:15:09 >> Commissioner Yee:   IS SO 
THAT CONCLUDES OUR
20:15:13  AGENDA ITEMS 
FOR THIS EVENING.
WE'LL MOVE ON
20:15:16  TO
20:15:19  MISCELLANEOUS 
ITEMS.
>> Planner Pullen:   THE 

20:15:22 AFFORDABLE HOUSING ORDINANCE YOU 
WILL RECALL CAME TO YOU AND YOU 
MADE A
20:15:25  MOTION, COUNCIL 
THEREAFTER APPROVED THE
20:15:28  
AFFORDABLE HOUSING ORDINANCE.
AND I KNOW SOME OF YOU WERE 

20:15:31 THERE SO YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH 
THE ACTION THEY TOOK.
20:15:34 
AND SO THAT HAPPENED.
THE
20:15:37  OTHER ITEM WAS THE CHAPEL 
WAY HOMES PROJECT WHICH
20:15:40  WENT TO 
COUNCIL, AND THIS WAS THE 
GENERAL PLAN
20:15:44  AMENDMENT SCREENING 
PROJECT.
THAT ITEM WENT TO COUNCIL,
20:15:47  AND 
COUNCIL AUTHORIZED THE FILING OF 
A GENERAL PLAN AMENDMENT FOR THE 

20:15:51 PURPOSE OF DEVELOPING THAT 
PROPERTY.
THAT GENERAL PLAN AMENDMENT
20:15:54  
APPLICATION IS NOT YET BEEN 
SUBMITTED TO THE CITY
20:15:57  BUT WE 
EXPECT THAT IT WILL COME IN THE 
NEAR FUTURE
20:16:00 .
THOSE ARE MY UPDATES, CHAIR.
>> Commissioner Yee:  
20:16:03  OKAY, 
WOULD ANY COMMISSIONERS LIKE TO 
SHARE ANY INFORMATION WITH THE 

20:16:06 REST OF THE COMMISSION?
COMMISSIONER DAULTON.

20:16:10 >> Commissioner Daulton:   THANK 
YOU CHAIR.
I'D LIKE TO MAKE A REFERRAL
20:16:14  AT 
THIS TIME OR PROPOSE A REFERRAL.
20:16:18 
MY REFERRAL WOULD BE TO INITIATE
20:16:21  
PROCEEDINGS, TO ADD THE
20:16:24  EUGENE 
GRAU HOUSE AT 4
20:16:28 70 SCHOOL STREET 
TO THE FREMONT REGISTER OF 
HISTORICAL RESOURCES
20:16:31 .

20:16:35 >> Commissioner Yee:   JOEL, GOT 
THAT?

20:16:42 OH, OH, CAN'T HEAR YOU JOEL.
20:16:45 
>> Planner Pullen:   I HAVE A 
MUTE PROBLEM.

20:16:48 SO THE WAY WE OPERATE REFERRALS 
IS, THE PERSON
20:16:51  MAKES THE 
REFERRAL AND THEN WE AGENDIZE 
THAT
20:16:54  ITEM FOR A FUTURE -- FOR A
20:16:57  
FUTURE MEETING WITH THE ASSENT
20:16:59  
OF THE MAJORITY OF THE 
COMMISSION HERE TONIGHT.

20:17:02 AND THEN WHEN WE HOLD THAT,
20:17:05  THEN 
STAFF WILL PROVIDE SOME 
INFORMATION
20:17:09 , AND PROVIDE THAT 
BACK TO YOU.
UNDERSTANDING
20:17:14  THAT COUNCIL 
DRIVES THE WORK OF THE
20:17:17  STAFF, 
THAT'S SOMETHING YOU CAN 
DISCUSS, AND MAKE 

20:17:21 RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT, AND WE'LL 
TAKE THOSE INTO ACCOUNT
20:17:25 .
YEAH ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU JOEL.

20:17:31 >> Commissioner Yee:   ALL RIGHT 
THANK YOU JOEL.
ANY
20:17:34  OTHER COMMISSIONERS HAVE ANY 
UPDATES
20:17:36 ?
COMMISSIONER McDONALD.
>> Commissioner McDonald:   I 

20:17:39 DON'T HAVE AN UPDATE BUT I HAVE 
AN ADD ON BECAUSE OF THAT.
20:17:42 
CAN COMMISSIONER DAULTON 
ELABORATE AS TO WHY THAT 

20:17:45 SPECIFIC REFERRAL IS COMING 
FORWARD?
AND WHAT THE CONDITIONS ARE
20:17:48  
THAT'S LEADING HIM TO PROPOSE 
THAT REFERRAL
20:17:52 ?
I THINK MAYBE WE COULD, YOU KNOW 
HAVE A
20:17:55  BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF 
IN SITUATION.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   I 

20:17:58 THINK WE DO THAT IN THE NEXT 
MEETING ACTUALLY, RIGHT,
20:18:01  JOEL?
>> Commissioner McDonald:   IS 
THAT HOW IT WORKS, JOEL
20:18:04 ?
BECAUSE I THOUGHT JOEL JUST SAID 
THAT WE NEED
20:18:07  TO AGREE ON THE 
REFERRAL.
RIGHT?

20:18:10 >> Planner Pullen:   I 
APOLOGIZE.
WITH THE ASSENT AT THE NEXT 

20:18:14 MEETING.
>> Commissioner McDonald:   AT 
THE NEXT MEETING, OH, OKAY, 

20:18:16 THANK YOU.
>> Planner Pullen:   I 
APOLOGIZE.

20:18:19 I JUST WANT TO VERIFY.
YOU SAID GRAU WHICH
20:18:22  I UNDERSTAND 
IS SPELLING G-R-A
20:18:25 -U.
I PROBABLY KNOW THE HOUSE BUT 
JUST TO
20:18:28  REFRESH MY MEMORY YOU 
SAID 460 SCHOOL?
20:18:30 
CAN.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   FOUR 

20:18:33 70 SCHOOL STREET.
>> Planner Pullen:  
20:18:36  470 SCHOOL.
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER WITH IT'S 
ON THE REGISTER OR
20:18:39  NOT.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   IT IS 
NOT ON THE REGISTER THAT'S
20:18:42  
CURRENTLY PUBLISHED UNDER THE 
GENERAL PLAN.

20:18:45 >> Planner Pullen:   THERE IS A 
PROCESS THAT INCLUDES PROPERTY
20:18:48  
OWNER PARTICIPATION IN SOME 
INSTANCES.

20:18:51 AND SO WE CAN CLARIFY THAT FOR 
YOU
20:18:55 .
>> Commissioner Daulton:   THIS 
PROPERTY IS OWNED BY THE CITY.

20:18:58 >> Planner Pullen:   GOT IT.
THE OTHER ANGLE IS THAT
20:19:01  PLACING 
PROPERTIES ON REGISTER IS ALSO 
REVIEWED BY HARB
20:19:04 .
SO I NEED TO CONSULT WITH OUR 
ATTORNEYS ABOUT THE
20:19:07  PROPRIETY OF 
COMING BACK DIRECTLY TO YOU.
20:19:10 
BUT IF IT'S POSSIBLE I'LL DO SO.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   OKAY,
20:19:13
