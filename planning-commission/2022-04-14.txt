>> THANK YOU JOEL
19:10:50  AND GOOD 
EVENING, COMMISSIONERS.
THE PROJECT
19:10:54  THAT'S BEFORE YOU IN 
THIS ITEM TONIGHT IS
19:10:57  THE MAHMUSH 
CONDOMINIUMS PROJECT WHICH IS
19:11:00  A 
PROPOSAL FOR A NEW SIX
19:11:04  UNIT 
19:11:08  
RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT ON BAY 
STREET IN IRVINGTON.
19:11:11 
TONIGHT'S PRESENTATION IS GOING 
TO BEGIN WITH AN OVERVIEW OF THE
19:11:13  
PERMITS AND BACKGROUND ON THE 
PROJECT SITE.

19:11:16 I'LL THEN PROVIDE AN OVERIS VIEW
19:11:19  
OF THE PROPOSED PROJECT AND AN 
ANALYSIS OF ITS
19:11:23  ZONING CONFORMS 
AND FINALLY MY PRESENTATION WILL
19:11:25  
CONCLUDE WITH STAFF'S 
RECOMMENDATION.

19:11:28 SO THE PROJECT REQUIRES APPROVAL 
OF TWO PERMITS
19:11:31 .
DISCRETIONARY DESIGN REVIEW 
PERMIT WHICH IS GENERALLY
19:11:35  
REQUIRED FOR MULTIFAMILY 
DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS.
19:11:38 
AND A
19:11:41  TENTATIVE TRACT MAP WHICH 
IS FOR CONDOMINIUM PURPOSES.
19:11:44 
THE TRACT MAP ALLOWS FOR EACH OF
19:11:48  
THE SIX UNITS TO BE SOLD 
SEPARATELY FROM ONE ANOTHER
19:11:51  AS 
CONDOMINIUMS.
THE PROPOSED PROJECT IS LOCATED 

19:11:55 ON A 5,000 SQUARE FOOT LOT ON 
BAY STREET
19:11:58  WITHIN THE IRVINGTON 
COMMUNITY PLAN AREA.
THE
19:12:02  GENERAL PLAN DESIGNATION FOR 
THE PROJECT SITE IS COMMERCIAL
19:12:05  
TOWN CENTER AND THE ZONING 
DESIGNATION IS P
19:12:09 -2007-
19:12:12 229I WHICH 
IS DESIGNATION OF THE
19:12:16  CITY 
INITIATED BAY STREET PLANNED 
DISTRICT.

19:12:19 THIS PLANNED DISTRICT WAS 
APPROVED BY CITY COUNCIL IN
19:12:22  2004 
IN ORDER TO
19:12:25  COORDINATE WITH THE 
REDEVELOPMENT AGENCY'S PLANNED 
INVESTMENTS IN THE BAY
19:12:28  STREET 
NEIGHBORHOOD.
AND IN PARTICULAR THE 

19:12:31 DEVELOPMENT OF A PUBLICLY OWNED 
PARKING LOT WHICH IS
19:12:34  TO BE 
SHARED AMONG THE BUSINESSES AND 
RESIDENTS.

19:12:37 THE GOAL OF THE BAY STREET 
PLANNED DISTRICT WAS TO
19:12:40  DEVELOP 
REGULATIONS THAT CREATED A 
PEDESTRIAN ORIENTED
19:12:44  STREETSCAPE 
AND COMMON OAN STREET AND
19:12:47  
OFFSTREET PARKING FACILITIES FOR 
THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

19:12:50 NOTABLY, THE BAY STREET PLANNED 
DISTRICT INCLUDES
19:12:53  SOME UNUSUAL 
REGULATIONS THAT YOU DON'T 
REALLY SEE IN MANY OTHER PLACES
19:12:56  
IN THE CITY AND THIS IS DUE TO 
THE UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCE OF THE 

19:13:00 CITY OWNED PUBLIC PARKING LOT 
AND THE CITY CONSTRUCTED
19:13:03  STREET 
IMPROVEMENTS TO WHICH PROPERTY 
OWNERS RECEIVE ACCESS.
19:13:06 
IN PARTICULAR, THE PLANNED 
DISTRICT ESTABLISHED A 

19:13:10 PROHIBITION ON CURB CUTS AND 
ONSITE AUTOMOBILE PARK
19:13:13 ING ON 
QUALIFYING LOTS, INCLUDING THE 
LOT THAT IS THE
19:13:16  SUBJECT OF THIS 
DEVELOPMENT PROPOSAL.

19:13:21 SURROUNDING PROPERTIES ON BAY 
STREET CONTAIN A
19:13:24  MIX OF 
COMMERCIAL AND RESIDENTIAL USES.

19:13:27 THE BUILDING TO THE NORTH ACROSS 
BAY STREET
19:13:31  IS THE ROTARY BRIDGE 
WAY APARTMENTS WHICH IS AN
19:13:34  18 
UNIT AFFORDABLE HOUSING 
DEVELOPMENT AND STRUCTURES TO 

19:13:37 THE EAST AND WEST OF THE PROJECT 
SITE WHICH WERE ORIGINALLY 
CONSTRUCT
19:13:40 ED AS SINGLE FAMILY 
HOMES HAVE MOSTLY BEEN CONVERTED
19:13:43  
INTO COMMERCIAL USES.
SOUTH OF THE PROJECTS
19:13:47  SITE IS 
THE SITE OF THE FORMER SA
19:13:50 NOFI 
SCHOOL WHICH IS THE SUBJECT OF A
19:13:53  
SEPARATE DEVELOPMENT APPLICATION 
WHICH PROPOSES A MIX
19:13:55  OF 
INSTITUTIONAL AND RESIDENTIAL 
USES.

19:13:59 THE APPROACHED PROJECT WOULD BE 
THE FIRST TO
19:14:02  REDEVELOP ONE OF 
THESE EXISTING LEGAL
19:14:05  
NONCONFORMING SINGLE FAMILY 
HOMES ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF BAY
19:14:09  
STREET WITH THE HIGHER DENSITY 
USE
19:14:12 S THAT THE DISTRICT INTENDS 
FOR THIS AREA.
THE
19:14:15  PROPOSED PROJECT WOULD 
DEMOLISH THE EXISTING SINGLE
19:14:18  
FAMILY HOME ON THIS PROPERTY, TO 
CONSTRUCT A THREE
19:14:21  STORY, SIX 
UNIT RESIDENTIAL BUILDING.
THE
19:14:25  PROJECT WOULD CONTAIN SIX, 
TWO
19:14:28  BEDROOM, TWO BATH 
RESIDENTIAL UNITS THAT RANGE IN
19:14:31  
SIDE FROM 1,000 SQUARE FEET
19:14:34  TO 
1150 SQUARE FEET.
CONSISTENT WITH THE BAY
19:14:37  STREET 
PLANNED DISTRICT, THE PROJECT 
WOULD NOT PROVIDE
19:14:40  ANY ONSITE CAR 
PARKING.
FIVE
19:14:44  LONG TERM BICYCLE LOCKERS 
AND FIVE SHORT
19:14:47  TERM BICYCLE 
RACKS WOULD BE PROVIDED NEAR THE
19:14:50  
BUILDING ENTRANCE.
PART OF THE MEETING
19:14:54  I UNDERSTAND 
THAT COMMISSIONERS RECEIVED
19:14:57  
CORRESPONDENCE INQUIRING ABOUT 
THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE SINGLE
19:15:00  
DOOR THAT IS SHOWN ON THE LONG 
TERM BICYCLE LOCKERS ON THE
19:15:02  
PLANS.
SO I'D LIKE TO CLARIFY THAT 

19:15:05 THERE WILL IN IN FACT BE THREE 
LONG TERM BICYCLE
19:15:09  LOCKERS TWO 
SOME TWO BIKE LOCKERS
19:15:12  AND ONE, 
ONE BIKE LOCKER AND EACH WILL
19:15:15  
HAVE ITS OWN DOOR TO FACILITATE
19:15:18  
ACCESS TO THE BICYCLES INSIDE.
SHORT
19:15:21  TERM BICYCLE RACKS WILL BE 
PLACED
19:15:27  IMMEDIATELY ALONGSIDE THE 
AREAS ON THE SIDE.
THE
19:15:30  DOORS ON THE LOCKERS THE 
SHORT
19:15:33  TERM RACKS THEMSELVES ARE 
NOT SHOWN
19:15:36  ON THE DRAWING IT SELF 
BUT WON'T BE
19:15:39  BECAUSE THEY WON'T 
BE PROVIDED.
THE PROPOSED PROJECT WOULD BE 

19:15:42 CONSISTENT WITH ALL OF THE 
APPLICABLE ZONING STANDARDS
19:15:45  FOR 
BUILDING INTENSITY, MASSING, SET 
BACK, AND
19:15:49  OPEN SPACE, AS
19:15:52  SHOWN 
ABBREVIATED ON THIS SLIDE AND IN 
MORE
19:15:55  DETAIL WITHIN THE TABLE IN 
YOUR STAFF
19:15:58  REPORT TONIGHT.
THE
19:16:01  PROPOSED PROJECT WOULD ALSO 
BE CONSISTENT WITH ALL OF THE
19:16:05  
APPLICABLE PARKING REGULATIONS.
AS CONSISTENT WITH
19:16:08  THE 
REQUIREMENTS OF THE BAY STREET 
DISTRICT, NO
19:16:11  CURB CUTS OR 
ONSTREET PARKING WOULD BE 
PROVIDED.

19:16:16 THE PROPOSED RECREATIONAL
19:16:23  ARCHITECTURAL STYLE 
IS MODERN BUILDING
19:16:26  ELEMENTS.
I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT IN MY 
PRESENTATION TONIGHT
19:16:29  THREE KEY 
FEATURES OF THE BUILDING.
THE STRONG
19:16:32  ARCHITECTURAL 
PRESENCE ORIENTED TOWARDS BAY 
STREET, THE
19:16:36  MASSING AND 
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF DETAIL ON 
ALL FOUR ELEVATION
19:16:39 S.
FIRST, THE MAIN BUILDING 
ENTRANCE AND
19:16:42  AN ENTRANCE TO THE 
TRONT-FACING RESIDENTIAL UNIT 
WOULD
19:16:46  ORIENT TOWARDS BAY STREET.
THE MAIN ENTRANCE WOULD BE 
RECESS
19:16:49 ED UNDER A COVERAGE 
PASSAGEWAY
19:16:53  WHICH WOULD 
ARCHITECTURALLY
19:16:56  ACCENTUATE THAT 
THOSE ELEMENTS.
REGARDING THE MASSING
19:17:00  THE 
PROPOSED BUILDING WOULD BE THREE 
STORIES TALL
19:17:03  WHICH IS GENERALLY 
CONSISTENT WITH OTHER BUILDINGS 
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.
19:17:06 
THE THIRD STORY OF THE BUILDING 
HAS A GREATER
19:17:09  SET BACK THAN THE 
LOWER TWO STORIES OF THE 
BUILDING IN ORDER TO REDUCE
19:17:14  THE 
APPARENT MASSING FROM THE 
STREET.

19:17:17 REFORMS ARE ALSO BROKEN UP INTO 
DRET
19:17:23  
DISCRETE ELEMENTS USING BUILDING 
FORMS, WHICH
19:17:26  FURTHER REDUCES THE 
APPARENT BUILDING BULK
19:17:30 .
FINALISTLY THE
19:17:34  BUILDING UTILIZES
19:17:37  
TO PROVIDE METAL DETAIL.
19:17:40 
METAL RAILINGS, A SINGLE SEAM 
METAL
19:17:44  ROOFING AND A HE METAL 
CANOPY WOULD
19:17:47  ADD A CONSISTENT 
THEME TO THE ROOF OF THE 
BUILDING
19:17:50 .
MODERN FLAT AND
19:17:53  HIP ROOF FORMS 
AND COMPLEMENTS THE ADJACENT
19:17:56  
BUILDINGS WHICH LARGELY UTILIZE 
A TRADITIONAL HIP ROOF
19:17:59 .
OVERALL, THE ARCHITECTURAL 
DESIGN
19:18:03  OF THE BUILDING COMPLIES 
WITH ALL RELEVANT DESIGN RULES.

19:18:10 WITH REGARD TO THE LANDSCAPE AND 
OPEN SPACE DESIGN OF THE
19:18:13  PROJECT 
THREE OUT OF FOUR EXISTING TREES 
ON THE SITE WOULD BE
19:18:16  RETAINED 
AND ONE EXISTING TREE WOULD BE 
REMOVED.

19:18:21 DUE TO SPACE CONSTRAINTS ON THE 
SITE THE APPLICANT
19:18:24  IS CURRENTLY 
PROPOSING TO PAY A TREE 
MITIGATION FEE
19:18:28  RATHER THAN PLANT 
A REPLACEMENT TREE BUT LANDSCAPE 
PLANT
19:18:31  
PLANTERS ALONG THE EAST, WEST 
AND SOUTH PROPERTY LINES
19:18:35  WOULD 
BE PLANTED WITH LOW
19:18:43  SHRUBS
19:18:47  AND 
GROUND COVERS.
ADDING GREEN
19:18:50  TO THE STREET 
FRONTAGE.
THAT CONCLUDES THE
19:18:54  STAFF'S 
REVIEW OF THE PROPOSED SUBJECT 
AND I WANTED
19:18:57  TO NOTE THAT THE
19:19:00  
MATTER IS SUBJECT TO THE HOUSING 
ACCOUNT
19:19:04 ABILITY ACT, REDUCE 
DENSITY OF HOUSING
19:19:07  PROPERTY MAPS 
THAT COMPLY
19:19:11  WITH THE SUBDIVISION 
STANDARDS AND CRITERIA UNLESS
19:19:14  
FINDINGS CAN BE MADE THAT THE 
PROJECT WOULD HAVE AN
19:19:17  
UNAVOIDABLE IMPACT ON HEALTH OR 
SAFETY THAT
19:19:20  CANNOT BE MITIGATED 
IN ANY OTHER
19:19:23  WAY OTHER THAN 
REDUCING ITS SIZE.
AS DISCUSSED IN
19:19:27  THIS 
PRESENTATION IT APPEARS THAT THE 
PROJECT COMPLIES WITH ALL 

19:19:29 APPLICABLE STANDARDS AND 
POLICIES.
AND STAFF DO NOT HAVE ANY 

19:19:32 EVIDENCE OF THE PROJECT WOULD 
RESULT IN UNAVOID
19:19:35 ABLE IMPACTS TO 
PUBLIC HEALTH OR SAFETY THAT
19:19:39  
WOULD
19:19:45  NECESSITATE ITS 
DISAPPROVAL
19:19:48 .
FINDS
19:19:51  IT'S CEQA
19:19:54  GUIDELINES 
SECTION 15183 AND THAT THE 
PROJECT IS
19:19:57  CONSISTENT WITH THE 
GENERAL PLAN AND ZONING.
19:20:00 
STAFF'S RECOMMENDATION IS TO 
ADDITIONALLY FIND THAT THE 

19:20:03 PROJECT IS IN CONFORMS
19:20:08  WITH THE 
PROJECT AND GENERAL PLAN AND TO 
APPROVE
19:20:11  THE DISCRETIONARY DESIGN 
PERMIT AND
19:20:14  TREE REMOVAL SUBJECT 
TO THE CONDITIONS OF APPROVAL 
WHICH ARE FOUND
19:20:18  IN EXHIBIT C IN 
YOUR PACKET TONIGHT.
THAT CONCLUDES STAFF
19:20:21 'S 
PRESENTATION THIS EVENING AND 
I'M NOT AVAILABLE FOR ANY
19:20:23  
QUESTIONS FROM COMMISSIONERS IF 
YOU HAVE THEM.

19:20:26 THANK YOU.

19:20:44 CHAIR DAULTON, YOU ARE ON MUTE 
IF YOU ARE SPEAKING
19:20:47 .
>> Commissioner Daulton:   CHAIR 
RECOGNIZES COMMISSIONER YEE FOR 

19:20:50 QUESTIONS OF STAFF.

19:20:57 BEN YOU'RE ON MUTE AS WELL.
>> Commissioner Yee:   YES
19:21:01 , 
SORRY, MY TIME
19:21:04  TO ACCIDENTALLY 
BE ON MUTE.
JUST FOLLOWING THE CHAIR'S LEAD.
19:21:07 
BUT ANYHOW
19:21:11  THANK YOU AGAIN 
COURTNEY FOR THE DETAILED 
PRESENTATION FOR THIS
19:21:13  PARTICULAR 
PROJECT.
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT MAYBE YOU 

19:21:16 CAN CLARIFY FOR ME BECAUSE I SAW 
IN THE PACKET
19:21:19 , IT TALKS ABOUT 
THE DENSITY.
YOU KNOW 30 TO
19:21:23  50 DWELLING UNITS 
PER ACRE YET IT SHOWS
19:21:26  IT'S 54.5.
SO TO ME THAT
19:21:29  EXCEEDS THE 
RECOMMENDATION RANGE
19:21:33 .
SO CAN YOU CLARIFY WHY IT SAYS 
IT WAS ROUNDED
19:21:35  UP?
THAT SOUNDS LIKE IT'S ROUNDED 
DOWN.

19:21:44 >> YES, SO IN THE MIPT FOR
19:21:50  MUNICIPAL CODE 
FOR PLANNED DISTRICTS THERE ARE 
PROVISIONS THAT
19:21:53  SAY THAT IF YOU 
DIVIDE THE UNIT DENSITY OR
19:21:57  THE 
NUMBER OF UNITS YOU GET FOR A 
SITE AND YOU COME UP WITH A 

19:22:00 FRACTION, IF THAT FRACTION IS 
ONE HALF OR GREATER, THEN
19:22:02  YOU 
ROUND UP.
AND IF THAT FRACTION IS LESS 

19:22:06 THAN ONE HALF YOU WOULD ROUND 
DOWN.
SO IF YOU SUBDIVIDE
19:22:09  THE .11 ACRE 
PROJECT SITE BY
19:22:13  A MAXIMUM 
DENSITY OF 50 DWELLING UNITS PER
19:22:16  
ACRE YOU WOULD GET A TOTAL OF 5.
19:22:19 
5.5 UNITS THAT ARE ALLOWED ON 
THE SITE AND THAT 5.
19:22:22 5 WOULD THEN 
BE RUNDED UP TO 6 WHICH IS WHAT
19:22:26  
THE PROJECT IS PROVIDING PER 
THAT STANDARD IN THE MUNICIPAL 

19:22:29 CODE.
SO THE PROJECT WOULD BE 
CONSIDERED TO BE
19:22:32  IN C
19:22:36  C
19:22:40  CONFORMANCE 
WITH THE MUNICIPAL CODE ON THAT 
ROUNDING RULE
19:22:44 .
>> Commissioner Yee:   I 
UNDERSTAND THAT, I'M LOOKING AT
19:22:47  
A STANDARD THAT SAYS 30 TO 50, 
THIS
19:22:50  STILL SAYS 55.50.
IF WE
19:22:54  I WERE TO LOOK AT THIS RANGE 
FROM A DETAILED AND
19:22:57  STRUCTURED 
PERSPECTIVE THIS TO ME LOOKS 
LIKE
19:23:01  IT'S EXCEEDING THIS 50 
NUMBER
19:23:04  EVEN THOUGH I UNDERSTAND 
WHERE YOU'RE COMING FROM WITH 
THIS
19:23:07 .
ALTHOUGH THIS IS ROUNDING UP OR 
ROUNDING DOWN TO A POINT
19:23:10  WHERE 
IT TRIES TO CONFORM INTO THIS 50
19:23:13  
BUT IN REALITY IT'S ACTUALLY 
STILL AT 54
19:23:17 .5.
>> SO WHEN WE'RE LOOKING
19:23:20  AT 
CONFORMANCE TO DENSITY WE'RE 
LOOKING AT CONFORMANCE TO
19:23:23  THE 
WAY THAT DENSITY IS CALCULATED 
PURSUANT
19:23:27  TO THE PLANNED DISTRICT 
REGULATIONS AND PURSUANT
19:23:31  TO THE 
MUNICIPAL CODE.
SO WHITE THE SHORT HANDLED
19:23:34  OF 
54.5 IS, YOU KNOW, ADMIT
19:23:38 LY OVER 
THE 50 MAXIMUM IN THE DENSITY 
RANGE THAT IS
19:23:41  A PERMITTED 
INCREASE IN DENSITY PURSUANT TO 
THE CODE
19:23:44  BECAUSE IT FALLS WITHIN 
THE PROVISION IN THE CODE THAT 
ALLOWS
19:23:47  THE APPLICANT TO ROUND UP 
FOR
19:23:51  HALF UNITS.
SO IT WOULD BE CONSIDERED 
CONSISTENT WITH THE REQUIREMENTS
19:23:53  
OF THE MUNICIPAL CODE.
>> Commissioner Yee:   ALL 

19:23:57 RIGHT.

19:24:00 >> Commissioner Daulton:   
ANYTHING ELSE, COMMISSIONER YEE?
19:24:01 
>> Commissioner Yee:   NO.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   ANY 

19:24:04 OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE OTHER 
COMMISSIONERS, FOR STAFF
19:24:09 ?
COURTNEY,
19:24:12  CAN YOU TELL ME HOW 
MANY SPACES ARE IN THE PUBLIC 
LOT
19:24:16  ON BAY STREET?
19:24:20 
>> I AM NOT FAMILIAR WITH THAT 
NUMBER
19:24:24  OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD.
SECRETARY PULLEN DID YOU KNOW
19:24:26 ?
>> Planner Pullen:   YES, CHAIR, 
THE PUBLIC
19:24:30  LOT ON BAY STREET I 
VISITED THERE
19:24:33  LAST WEEK IS ABOUT 
40 SPACES, I COULD BE OFF
19:24:35 , 
BECAUSE I WAS LOOKING IN AND 
COUNTING.

19:24:38 AND THE STREET FRONTAGE IS
19:24:42  
AROUND 800 AND CHANGE.
850
19:24:45  FEET ALONG THAT AREA.
SO IT'S ABOUT 35, 40
19:24:48 , DEPENDING 
ON HOW LONG THE CARS ARE,
19:24:52  PUBLIC 
CURB PARKING SPACES OVER THAT 
STRETCH OF 12 HOUSES
19:24:56  ON BAY 
STREET.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   OKAY.
19:24:59 
AND IS THERE ANY FEE TO THE 
PROPERTY OWNERS OR
19:25:02  THE BUSINESS 
OWNERS FOR THAT PUBLIC PARKING 
LOT
19:25:07 ?
>> NO, THERE IS NO FEE THAT 
BUSINESS
19:25:10  OWNERS MUST PAY TO 
ACCESS THE PUBLIC PARKING LOT.
19:25:14 
>> Commissioner Daulton:   AND 
WHAT'S -- JUST GUESSING
19:25:17 , HOW FAR 
OF A WALK IS IT TO THE PROPOSED
19:25:21  
BART STATION?
19:25:25 
>> THE PROJECT IS APPROXIMATELY 
A HALF MILE FROM THE BART 

19:25:29 STATION.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   SO 
WHAT DO WE CALL THAT, SEVEN
19:25:32  
MINUTES WALK MAYBE?
YEAH, OKAY.

19:25:36 >> APPROXIMATELY.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   ALL 
RIGHT, ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM 

19:25:39 THE COMMISSIONERS?
ALL RIGHT IN THAT CASE, I
19:25:43  
BELIEVE WE ARE GOING TO TURN TO 
THE APPLICANT
19:25:47  FOR THEIR 
PRESENTATION.

19:25:51 I'M NOT SURE WHO I'M RECOGNIZING 
HERE BUT DO WE HAVE THE
19:25:55  
APPLICANT HERE TO GIVE A 
PRESENTATION
19:25:58  ON THIS PROJECT?
19:26:04 
ANYONE?
>> YES, WE ARE HERE.

19:26:07 >> Commissioner Daulton:   OKAY.
IT'S YOUR TURN.
YOU HAVE
19:26:10  TEN MINUTES.
>> OKAY
19:26:13 .
IT'S MY WIFE AND MY NAME
19:26:17  IS MUSH 
AH
19:26:20 MED AND WE WANT TO SAY 
SOMETHING ABOUT THIS PROJECT.
SO SHE IS
19:26:24  JUST GOING TO GIVE 
FIVE MINUTE TALK ABOUT IT.
>> HELLO
19:26:27  EVERYONE.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME 
THIS EVENING
19:26:30 .
I WANTED TO FIRST JUST QUICKLY 
INTRODUCE US
19:26:34 .
WE'VE BEEN LONG TIME RESIDENTS 
OF FREMONT,
19:26:37  MY GRANDPARENTS, I 
BASICALLY GREW UP
19:26:40  IN MY 
GRANDPARENTS
19:26:44  ITALIAN RESTAURANT, 
LUCIA
19:26:49 'S TARNL RESTAURANT FOR 
MANY YEARS.
THAT GAVE
19:26:52  ME MY INSPIRATION TO 
OPEN MY CURRENT BUSINESS IN
19:26:55  
FREMONT WHICH IS NOW 18 YEARS 
OLD AND WE HAVE A SECOND
19:26:59  
LOCATION WITHIN FREMONT FOR MEAT 
AND DELI SO WE
19:27:02  ARE VERY MUCH A 
PART OF THE FREMONT COMMUNITY.
WE TAKE
19:27:05  PART IN ALL TYPES OF 
SUPPORT, FUND RAISERS
19:27:08  AND 
EVERYTHING WE CAN DO TO HELP 
SUPPORT THE COMMUNITY.

19:27:11 SO JUST TO GET A BRIEF 
UNDERSTANDING OF
19:27:14  OUR PERSONAL
19:27:18  -- 
OUR -- WHAT WE ARE LOOKING TO DO 
FOR THIS
19:27:21  PARTICULAR PROJECT, 
BECAUSE OF OWNING THESE 
BUSINESSES WE'VE BEEN
19:27:24  HAVING A 
REALLY HARD TIMEKEEPING OUR 
STAFF
19:27:28  LIVING.
>> FR
19:27:31  IN FREMONT.
ONE OF OUR IDEAS
19:27:34 , WE HAVE FAMILY 
THAT WORKS FOR US AND LONG TERM 
STAFF
19:27:38  THAT ARE OUR FAMILY, HAVE 
BECOME FAMILY FOR US
19:27:41 .
WE WANT TO CREATE A SPACE
19:27:44  FOR 
THEM TO BE ABLE TO RENT AND US 
SUPPORTING THEM TO BE
19:27:47  ABLE TO 
HAVE AFFORDABLE RENT AND HAVE 
THE WALKING
19:27:50  KIND OF POSITION FOR 
THEIR RESIDENTS BECAUSE OUR 
RESTAURANT
19:27:54  IS LITERALLY ACROSS 
THE STREET FROM BAY STREET ON
19:27:57  
FREMONT BOULEVARD.
IT'S 40
19:28:00 900 FREMONT BOULEVARD AND 
BOTH OF OUR LOCATION
19:28:03 S ARE 
LOCATED IN THE SAME STRIP.
SO FOR US IT'S
19:28:07  A COMBINATION OF 
TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR 
EMPLOYEES ARE LIVING
19:28:10  A QUALITY 
LIFE AND SECONDLY,
19:28:13  THAT THEY'RE 
ABLE TO RETAIN -- WE ARE ABLE TO
19:28:16  
RETAIN THEM.
WE HAVE LOST SOME OF OUR PEOPLE 

19:28:19 TO MOVING OUT OF STATE BECAUSE 
THEY JUST CAN'T AFFORD IT, TO
19:28:22  
LIVE IN THE BAY AREA ANYMORE.
AND WE ARE
19:28:25  BEING SEVERELY 
IMPACTED BY THE LABOR SHORTAGE.
WE ARE CURRENTLY
19:28:28  HIRING AND 
UNFORTUNATELY HAVE NOT BEEN 
SUCCESSFUL IN FIND
19:28:32 ING ANY 
CANDIDATES.
SO THESE ARE EXTREMELY
19:28:35  VIABLE 
EMPLOYEES FOR US.
AND BASICALLY, IF THEY HAD
19:28:38  TO 
MOVE FAR ENOUGH AWAY FROM 
FREMONT WHERE THEY
19:28:41  COULDN'T 
COMMUTE THEN WE PRETTY MUCH 
WOULD PROBABLY LOSE
19:28:45  OUR BUSINESS 
AT THIS
19:28:48  POINT.
SO WE JUST WANTED TO GIVE YOU 
THAT PERSPECTIVE.
19:28:51 
THAT IS OUR MAIN -- OUR MAIN 
GOAL.

19:28:54 WE ARE NOT TRYING TO BASICALLY 
BUILD
19:28:57  A PROJECT FOR PROFIT.
IT'S MORE OF A COMMUNITY
19:29:00  BASED 
ENDEAVOR FOR OUR BUSINESS BUT 
ALSO IN GENERAL,
19:29:05  WE HAVE BEEN IN 
FREMONT FOR SO LONG THAT FREMONT 
IS VERY SPECIAL
19:29:08  TO US SO WE 
WANTED TO ADD VALUE.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
19:29:12  YOUR TIME.

19:29:15 >> Commissioner Daulton:   THANK 
YOU.
DO -- IS THERE ANYONE
19:29:18  ELSE FROM 
YOUR TEAM WHO HAS ANYTHING ELSE 
TO
19:29:22  SAY?
OKAY.
ALL RIGHT.
19:29:26 
THEN AT THIS POINT TRISH CAN WE
19:29:28  
INVITE PUBLIC COMMENT ON THIS 
ITEM PLEASE?

19:29:31 >> YES.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   HOW 
MANY SPEAKERS HAVE WE
19:29:34  GOT?
>> GIVE ME A MOMENT, I'M GOING 
TO REMOVE
19:29:38  THE TIMER AND I'LL 
TAKE A LOOK AT THE SPEAKERS WE 
HAVE
19:29:41 , JUST ONE MOMENT.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   GREAT
19:29:44 
GREAT, THANK YOU.
>> IF ANYBODY WANTS TO SPEAK
19:29:47 , 
OKAY I DO SEE A HAND AND WE HAVE 
ONE
19:29:50  SPEAKER AND DID YOU SAY TWO 
MINUTES?
>> Commissioner Daulton:   ONE 

19:29:53 SPEAKER GIVE THEM THREE MINUTES 
PLEASE.
>> THREE MINUTES.

19:29:56 SO LET ME SEE THE SPEAKER IS
19:29:59  S 
KHALSA.
GO AHEAD AND SPEAK.

19:30:08 >> OKAY THANK YOU, CAN YOU HEAR 
ME OKAY?
19:30:10 
>> YES.
>> WONDERFUL, THANK YOU SO MUCH.

19:30:13 AS I SAID BEFORE MY MISTAKE 
SORRY I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT
19:30:16  THAT 
WASN'T THE RIGHT TIME TO BE 
TALKING.

19:30:19 I OWN THE PROPERTY ON THE EAST 
SIDE MUCH
19:30:23  OF THE PROJECT SITE.
I'M AT
19:30:26  4152 BAY STREET.
AND MY BUSINESS
19:30:29  THERE AS A 
HEALTH CARE
19:30:32  CLINIC.
AND I'M A CHIROPRACTIC
19:30:36  CHIROPRACTOR AND MY 
CUSTOMERS ARE PATIENTS
19:30:39 .
AND THESE PEOPLE, YOU KNOW, COME 
TO MY OFFICE BECAUSE THEY
19:30:42  NEED 
MY SERVICES.
MOST OF THESE PEOPLE ARE
19:30:46  IN PAIN 
AND THEY'RE SUFFERING
19:30:49  PHYSICAL 
DIFFICULTIES WHICH MAKES IT HARD 
FOR THEM TO WALK VERY FAR
19:30:54 .
SO PRESENTLY THAT'S THE CASE.
AS IT IS PARK
19:30:57 ING CAN BE VERY 
DIFFICULT AT TIMES.
SO
19:31:00  MY CONCERN IS, HOW WILL ADD
19:31:03 
ADDING THE CARS THAT WILL COME 
FROM AN ADDITIONAL
19:31:06  SIX UNITS 
IMPACT THE PARKING ON
19:31:10  BAY 
STREET?
NOW, I
19:31:13  KNOW, I'M FAMILIAR WITH 
THAT CENTRAL PARKING
19:31:17  LOT THAT 
WAS DONE WHEN THE BAY STREET 
PROJECT WAS DONE
19:31:20 .
AND THE CITY DID A GREAT JOB 
WITH THAT.

19:31:23 I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT.
HOWEVER
19:31:26 , PRESENTLY,
19:31:29  WHO PARKS IN 
THAT PARKING LOT AND WHO LIVES 
IN THAT PARK
19:31:33 ING LOT ARE HOMELESS 
PEOPLE IN CASE YOU DIDN'T KNOW 
THIS.
19:31:36 
YOU CAN DRIVE BY AND LOOK THERE.
YOU'LL SEE
19:31:39  RVS PARKED AND TENTS 
AND SOMETIMES A BIG
19:31:42  MESS IN 
THERE.
THEY'VE TAKEN OVER THAT PARKING 

19:31:45 LOT TO A CERTAIN EXTENT.
WHAT THAT -- WHAT
19:31:48  THAT CAUSES 
IS, IT'S DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE TO 
PARK
19:31:51  THERE AND FEEL THAT THEIR 
CARS ARE GOING TO BE SAFE
19:31:55 .
I'VE HAD MY PATIENTS COME TO MY 
OFFICE AND TELL
19:31:58  ME WHEN THEY 
CAN'T FIND STREET PARKING, AND 
THEY
19:32:01  HAVE TO GO TO THAT PARKING 
LOT, THEY'RE AFRAID
19:32:05  FOR THEIR 
CARS TO BE PARKED THERE.
SO THAT'S AN ON
19:32:08 GOING ISSUE.
19:32:11 
SO I JUST SEE
19:32:16  THAT, WITH THE 
ADDITIONAL CARS THAT WOULD BE 
ADDED FROM SIX MORE
19:32:19  UNITS AND 
THAT COULD BE AS MANY AS 12 CARS 
IF IT'S TWO
19:32:22  PER UNIT, IT'S GOING 
TO BE A
19:32:26  DISASTER FOR PARKING ON 
BAY
19:32:29  STREET.
I SPOKE
19:32:33  TO MUSH SOMETIME AGO,
19:32:36  
WE'RE NEIGHBORS AND WE'VE'S 
GOTTEN ALONG AND HE SAID
19:32:39  HE 
WANTED TO PROVIDE OFFSTREET 
PARKING FOR
19:32:42  HIS PROJECT BUT THE 
CITY WOULDN'T ALLOW IT BECAUSE 
OF THE GENERAL PLAN
19:32:46 .
THAT'S UNDERSTOOD.
BUT I THINK THIS IS A
19:32:49  SHORT 
SIGHTED MISTAKE SO I SUPPORT 
MUSH
19:32:53 'S RIGHT TO BUILD ON HIS 
PROPERTY BUT I CAN'T
19:32:56  APPROVE IT 
UNLESS THE PROJECT INCLUDES OFF
19:32:59 
OFF-STREET PARKING.
SO THAT, TO
19:33:02  ME, IS THE BIG 
ISSUE.
AND
19:33:06  BECAUSE OF THE GENERAL PLAN 
I THINK THE GENERAL PLAN NEEDS 
TO BE
19:33:09  MODIFIED TO ALLOW 
OFF-STREET PARKING SO
19:33:12  THAT THAT 
PARKING SITUATION DOESN'T
19:33:15  
BALLOON INTO SOMETHING EVEN 
WORSE.

19:33:18 >> Commissioner Daulton:   THANK 
YOU SIR.
>> ALSO CAN
19:33:21  I SAY --
>> Commissioner Daulton:   TIME 
IS UP SIR
19:33:24  HANG ON.
>> OKAY FINE.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   I 

19:33:27 APPRECIATE IT.
SO I'D LIKE TO
19:33:31  GIVE COUPLE 
MINUTES TO THE APPLICANT, IF 
THEY
19:33:34  HAVE ANY REBUTTAL ON THIS 
PUBLIC COMMENT.

19:33:39 IF THEY CARE TO TAKE IT.

19:33:44 >> Planner Pullen:   THE TIME IS 
FIVE MINUTES TRISH, JUST FOR 
CONSISTENT
19:33:47 CY.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   FIVE 
MINUTES, YES
19:33:51 .
>> NO, WE DON'T HAVE
19:33:54  THEY 
REBUTTAL TO HIS COMMENTS.
I MEAN ONE THING
19:33:57  EXACTLY WHAT HE 
IS SAYING IS RIGHT ABOUT THE 
PARKING LOT
19:34:00 .
THAT IT'S EMPTY MOST OF THE 
TIME.

19:34:03 BUT LOT OF PEOPLE ARE HESITANT 
TO PARK THERE.
19:34:07 
THE WHOLE PARKING LOT WHICH HAVE 
OVER 40
19:34:10 , 42 PARKINGS ARE 
MAJORITY OF
19:34:13  TIME EMPTY.
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW IF BECAUSE
19:34:16  
PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO PARK THERE, 
BECAUSE WHAT HE JUST SAID
19:34:20 , OR 
WHAT, IF THERE'S ANY OTHER 
REASON
19:34:23  BUT MOSTLY, I MEAN IF 
THAT PARKING LOT IS AVAILABLE
19:34:28 , 
IF IT IS AVAILABLE AND
19:34:31  PEOPLE 
START PARKING THERE I DON'T SEE 
ANY PROBLEM FOR THE PARKING IN
19:34:34  
THAT AREA.

19:34:38 >> Commissioner Daulton:   OKAY, 
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
DO WE
19:34:41  HAVE ANY FURTHER 
CLARIFYING QUESTIONS FROM THE 
COMMISSION
19:34:45 ?
IF NOT, I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD 
AND
19:34:48  CLOSE THE PUBLIC HEARING
19:34:52  FOR 
THIS ITEM.

19:34:56 AND ASK THE COMMISSIONERS IF 
THEY HAVE
19:34:59  ANY COMMENTS OR 
DELIBERATIONS.

19:35:05 ANYONE?
COMMISSIONER YEE
19:35:09 .
>> Commissioner Yee:   OKAY, 
THIS TIME I'M UN
19:35:12 MUTED SO NOW I'M 
SURE THAT YOU CAN HEAR ME.
YEAH,
19:35:15  I -- AS YOU HAIRED ME 
EARLIER DURING DISCLOSURE
19:35:19 S I 
WENT OUT THERE SEVERAL TIMES.
AT DIFFERENT HOURS
19:35:22  OF THE 
MORNING AND INTO THE AFTERNOON, 
TO
19:35:25  SEE, YOU KNOW, THE SITUATION 
FOR THE PARKING.
BECAUSE
19:35:28  CERTAINLY PARKING THERE
19:35:31  
IS DEFINITELY ONE OF THE BIGGEST 
PROBLEMS.

19:35:34 I SPOKE WITH THE BUSINESS OWNERS 
THAT WOULD BE DIRECT
19:35:38 LY AFFECTED, 
THREE OF THE BUSINESS OWNERS AND
19:35:41 
AND, YOU KNOW, AND ALSO SPOKE 
WITH THE PUBLIC
19:35:44  SPEAKER, YOU 
KNOW, IT'S DEFINITELY A CONCERN 
FOR HIS PATIENTS
19:35:47  THAT HAVE TO 
WALK.
AND SO IT WAS JUST INTERESTING 

19:35:50 THAT I ENDED UP SPEAKING WITH 
THE
19:35:54  BEAUTY SALON OWNER THAT IS 
ADJACENT TO
19:35:57  THIS PROPERTY AND 
JUST HAPPENED THAT ONE OF HER 
CLIENTS
19:36:00  WAS IN THERE AND I ASKED 
THE QUESTION, WELL,
19:36:03  HOW FAR AWAY 
DID YOU HAVE TO PARK?
AND THE ANSWER
19:36:07  WAS ABOUT, MORE 
THAN TWO BLOCKS AWAY.
SO I
19:36:10  GUESS ONE OF THE CONCERNS I 
HAVE IS THAT, WITH
19:36:13  A PROJECT 
LIKE THIS, WITH ADDITIONAL 
VEHICLES
19:36:16 , THAT ARE GOING TO BE 
PARKED INTO THE AREA, HOW
19:36:19 'S THAT 
GOING TO IMPACT THE BUSINESSES 
THAT ARE IN THE
19:36:22  AREA?
BECAUSE IT'S ALREADY IMPACTED 
PARKING
19:36:25  SITUATION THAT'S THERE 
NOW.
AND THEN THE OTHER THING TOO FOR
19:36:29  
ME, AS I WAS TRYING TO WALK 
ACROSS THE
19:36:32  STREET I WANTED TO 
MAKE SURE TO GET THERE TO SEE 
WHAT IT WAS
19:36:35  LIKE DURING PICKUP.
19:36:38 
I BELIEVE THERE WAS A DAYCARE 
THAT'S DOWN THE STREET.

19:36:41 AND I KIND OF HAD TO KIND OF 
LIKE DODGE
19:36:44  CARS IN ORDER TO TRY 
TO GET ACROSS THE
19:36:47  STREET WITHOUT 
GETTING RUN OVER.
BECAUSE THOSE PARENTS
19:36:50 , JUST LIKE 
PARENTS IN OTHER SCHOOLS, HAVE A 
TENDENCY
19:36:54  TO DRIVE FASTER THAN 
THEY SHOULD.
SO I HAVE SOME
19:36:57  CONCERNS ABOUT 
HAVING ADDITIONAL VEHICLES THAT 
ARE GOING TO BE
19:37:01  PARKED ALONG AND 
AROUND THAT AREA WITH
19:37:04  THESE 
VEHICLES THAT ARE COMING THROUGH
19:37:07  
DAILY FOR PICKUP FOR THE 
CHILDREN, BUT AT THE SAME TIME
19:37:11 , 
I'M ALSO CONCERNED FOR THE 
BUSINESSES IN THE AREA THAT ARE
19:37:14  
GOING TO BE DIRECTLY IMPACTED 
THAT THEIR PATIENTS OR
19:37:17  THEIR 
CLIENTS WILL HAVE TO PARK EVEN 
FURTHER.

19:37:20 BECAUSE I KNOW THERE WAS A 
DISCUSSION ABOUT THAT PARKING 
LOT.
19:37:23 
BUT I'M SURE THAT IF YOU WENT 
OUT THERE YOU WOULD SEE THAT
19:37:27  THE 
RVS ARE THERE, THE HOMELESS 
ENCAMPMENT
19:37:30  IS THERE, I CAN 
UNDERSTAND PEOPLE WON'T PARK 
THERE
19:37:33  BECAUSE CONCERN FOR THEIR 
OWN SAFETY AS WELL AS THEIR OWN 
VEHICLE SAFETY
19:37:36  AS WELL.
BECAUSE IT'S PARKED, IF THEY HAD 
TO PARK
19:37:39  THEIR CARS OVER THERE 
THEN THEY WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO 
SEE IF SOMETHING DID HAPPEN
19:37:42  TO 
THE CARS.
SO I JUST -- THAT'S WHAT I 

19:37:45 WANTED TO JUST SAY.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   OKAY,
19:37:48  
THANK YOU.
COMMISSIONER LIU YOUR COMMENTS
19:37:49 .
>> Commissioner Liu:   THANK 
YOU.

19:37:52 SO I HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE 
STAFF.
19:37:56 
SO ASSUMING
19:38:01  THE STAFF CAN SOLVE 
THE
19:38:04  SAFETY OF THE POTENTIAL 
PARKING AT THE 40
19:38:07 -SLOT PARKINGS 
SITE,
19:38:11  AT WHAT POINT IF THERE ARE 
OTHER HOMEOWNERS WHO ALSO
19:38:14  WANT 
TO CONVERT THEIR HOME SITES INTO 
HIGH
19:38:17  DENSITY HOUSING, AND DO WE 
STOP APPROVING
19:38:21  THOSE 
APPLICATIONS, IF WE REACH
19:38:24  OUR 
CAPACITY OF
19:38:28  40 AND REQUIRE 
FUTURE PROJECTS TO HAVE
19:38:31  SOME 
KIND OF PARKING SOLUTION
19:38:34 ?
19:38:40 
AND WHEN DO WE STOP?
>> SO THE INTENTION OF THE
19:38:43  BAY 
STREET PARKING DISTRICT WHEN IT 
WAS ESTABLISHED IN 2004
19:38:46  WAS TO 
ALLOW FOR DENSITIES
19:38:50  AND TYPES 
THAT FLEKSD THE PARKING THAT
19:38:53  WAS 
DEVELOPED UNDER THAT PLAN.
SO THE PLAN FORE
19:38:56 SAW THE CREATION 
OF THE.
40 SPACES IN THE
19:38:59  PUBLIC BAY 
STREET PARKING LOT AND IT ALSO 
FORESAW
19:39:03  THE CREATION OF STREET 
PARKING CREATED BY THE LACK
19:39:07  OF 
CURB CUTS THAT WOULD BE ALONG 
BAY STREET
19:39:10  WHEN THESE PROJECTS 
WERE APPROVED WITHOUT
19:39:13  ANY ONSITE 
PARKING.
AND SO NOT ALL LOTS
19:39:16  IN THE BAY 
STREET PLANNED DISTRICT HAVE
19:39:20  A 
PROHIBITION OF ONSITE PARK.
IT'S MOST
19:39:23 LY LIMITED TO THESE 
LOTS ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF BAY 
STREET
19:39:26  THAT ARE SMALLER SINGLE 
FAMILY RESIDENTIAL LOTS WHERE
19:39:29  IT 
WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT TO 
REDEVELOP THEM WITH PARK
19:39:33 ING 
FACILITIES.
AND SO THE PLANNED
19:39:36  DISTRICT 
INTENDED THAT AT ITS FULL 
BUILDOUT WITH ALL
19:39:39  EVER THESE 
LOTS CONVERTED THERE
19:39:42  WOULD BE 
SUFFICIENT PARKING PROVIDED 
WITHIN THE PLANNED DISTRICT 

19:39:46 AREA.
JUST GIVEN THE BALANCE OF USES 
AND THE ADDITION OF THE PUBLIC
19:39:49  
PARKING LOT AND THE ONSTREET 
PARKING
19:39:54 .
>> Commissioner Liu:   OKAY, 
THANK YOU
19:39:58 .
>> Planner Pullen:   I CAN WEIGH 
IN ON THE PARKING A LITTLE MORE.
19:40:01 
YOU KNOW, THERE IS SOMETIMES A 
TENDENCY TO COUNT ALL OF
19:40:04  THEM AT 
MAX CAPACITY.
AND YOU KNOW
19:40:07 , IN ADDITION TO 
WHAT COURTNEY SAID ABOUT YOU
19:40:10  
KNOW THESE PROPERTIES THEY'RE 
NARROW, YOU COULDN'T FIT A PARK
19:40:14 
PARKING MODULE VERY WELL ON THEM 
IF THEY WERE TO
19:40:17  DEVELOP 
INDIVIDUALLY LIKE IT'S VERY 
COMMON FOR THEM TO GO UP
19:40:21 .
THERE IS SORT OF
19:40:25  A PHILOSOPHICAL 
OKTOBERFEST
19:40:31  
OBJECTIVE HERE OF PROVIDING MORE 
PARK AVAILABLE AND AVAILABLE
19:40:35  TO 
EVERYBODY PARKING.
SO WHEN I LEAVE MY GARAGE
19:40:38  IN THE 
MORNING I REMOVE MY CAR AND THAT 
PLACE
19:40:41  STAYS EMPTY ALL DAY UNTIL 
I COME HOME IF I'M GONE
19:40:45  FROM MY 
HOUSE.
BUT IF I TRADE THAT SPACE FOR A
19:40:48  
STREET SPACE THEN I LEAVE AND 
SOMEONE ELSE COMES AND PROVIDES
19:40:51  
A SERVICE OR COMES TO ANOTHER 
BUSINESS AND THAT PARK
19:40:54 ING 
CHANGES OVER TIME.
19:40:58 

19:41:01 AND PARKING SPACES ARE GENERALLY 
MORE THOROUGHLY
19:41:04  OR CONSISTENTLY 
USED WHEN THEY ARE SHARED IN 
THAT WAY SO
19:41:07  THERE IS A 
MULTIPLIER WHEN THEY'RE SHARED
19:41:11  
LIKE THAT, THAT IS INTENDED OF 
THIS PLANNED DISTRICT FOR A
19:41:13  
VARIETY OF REASONS.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   THANK 

19:41:16 YOU JOEL.
COMMISSIONER YEE, ANOTHER 
QUESTION,
19:41:19  COMMENT?
19:41:28 
YOU'RE STILL MUTED.
>> Commissioner Yee:   WE ALSO 

19:41:31 HAVE TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION 
YOU KNOW WHEN WE LOOK
19:41:34  AT THE 
MAXIMUM SPACES AVAILABLE, WE 
ALSO, LET'S NOT
19:41:37  FORGET, YOU 
KNOW, THERE'S THE IRVINGTON 
FARMERS MARKET
19:41:40 .
YOU KNOW, AND WHEN THAT HAPPENS, 
YOU KNOW, SPACES ARE
19:41:44  ALL TAKEN 
AS WELL.
AND I'M JUST
19:41:47  -- I HAVE A CONCERN 
ABOUT HAVING THESE
19:41:51  SIX CONDOS 
WITH ADDITIONAL
19:41:54  VEHICLES THAT 
ARE GOING TO BE NEED
19:41:57 ED TO FIND 
PARKING ESPECIALLY IF
19:42:00  ON THE 
WEEKENDS AS WELL, BECAUSE OF THE 
IRVINGTON
19:42:04  MARKET, LET ALONE JUST 
EVEN WHAT I
19:42:07  SAW DURING THE WEEK, 
WHERE THESE BUSINESSES ARE 
TRYING TO
19:42:11  HAVE THEIR CLIENTS 
COME IN AND IT WAS REALLY 
DIFFICULT FOR
19:42:14  ME TO FIND 
PARKING.
I HAD TO PARK A
19:42:17  BLOCK OR TWO 
AWAY IN ORDER TO
19:42:20  GET IN, TO TALK 
TO THE BUSINESS OWNERS.

19:42:25 >> Commissioner Daulton:   OKAY.
THANK YOU, COMMISSIONER YEE.
19:42:28 
I HAVE A FEW COMMENTS ON THIS 
PROJECT.

19:42:31 AGAIN I'D LIKE TO THANK COURTNEY 
FOR HER PRESENTATION
19:42:35 .
THIS DEVELOPMENT DOES
19:42:39  FALL 
WITHIN THE TOD OF THE
19:42:43  PLANNED 
BART STATION.
AS YOU GUYS NOTED
19:42:47 , IT'S 
EMINENTLY WALKABLE
19:42:50  TO THE BART 
STATION.
YOU CAN WALK TO THE SAFEWAY, 

19:42:53 IT'S LIKE FIVE MINUTES FROM 
THERE.
THERE'S ALL KINDS OF BUSINESSES
19:42:56  
IN THAT NEIGHBORHOOD.
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A T
19:42:59 OD WHICH 
HOPEFULLY SOME DAY WILL
19:43:04  BE 
PEDESTRIAN-FRIENDLY ENVIRONMENT,
19:43:08  
WITH THE POSSIBILITY THAT
19:43:11  
SOMEONE MIGHT LIVE IN A PLACE 
LIKE THIS
19:43:14  CONDOMINIUMS, WITHOUT 
EVEN OWNING A CAR OR
19:43:17  MAYBE WITH 
ONE CAR INSTEAD OF TWO.
THIS IS
19:43:21  THE STRATEGIC 
URBANIZATION
19:43:24  THAT WE, I THOUGHT, 
HAD ALL SIGNED ON HERE
19:43:28 .
SO I
19:43:31  UNDERSTAND THAT PEOPLE ARE 
AFRAID
19:43:34  OF THE HOMELESS.
I'M SORRY, FEAR OF THE HOMELESS
19:43:37  
CANNOT STOP DEVELOPMENT OF
19:43:41  A 
PROPER TOD HERE AND THE 
ALLOWANCE
19:43:45  FOR RESIDENTS IN 
FREMONT TO HAVE THE OPTION TO
19:43:48  
NOT HAVE A CAR, AND TO LIVE AND
19:43:52  
WORK WITH A ROBUST TRANSIT 
SYSTEM
19:43:58  AVAILABLE TO THEM WITHIN 
THE TOD.
I APPLAUD
19:44:02  THIS PROJECT.
I APPLAUD THE BAY STREET PLANNED 
DISTRICT.
19:44:05 
I THINK IT'S A GREAT
19:44:08  ELEMENT OF 
THE IRVINGTON PLAN
19:44:12 .
AND I HOPE THAT MY
19:44:15  FELLOW 
COMMISSIONERS WILL GIVE THIS A 
SHOT.

19:44:18 I MEAN, I'D LIKE TO
19:44:21  LIMIT 
PARKING THROUGHOUT THE TOD 
MYSELF BECAUSE
19:44:24  I DON'T SEE ANY 
OTHER WAY TO GET THE DENSITY 
THAT WE
19:44:28  NEED IN FREMONT,
19:44:32  WITHOUT 
STARTING TO BUILD
19:44:35 , YOU KNOW, IN 
THE HILLS OR PLACES WHERE WE 
DON'T WANT TO BUILD
19:44:39 .
I THINK THAT
19:44:42  SEVERAL, I MEAN AT 
LEAST TWO OF THE OTHER 
COMMISSIONERS WERE ON
19:44:46  THE 
COMMISSION WHEN WE APPROVED
19:44:49  THE 
IRVINGTON SITE PLAN OF WHICH BAY 
STREET
19:44:53  PLANNED DISTRICT WAS A 
PART.
SO YOUR VOTES AT THAT TIME
19:44:56  WERE 
FAVORABLE TO THIS PROJECT
19:45:00 .
SO I WOULD REQUEST
19:45:04  OR PLEAD WITH 
MY FELLOW COMMISSIONERS
19:45:08  TO VOTE 
YES ON THIS PROJECT.
19:45:11 
AND ALLOW FOR A ROBUST PID
19:45:14  
PEDESTRIAN
19:45:17  ENVIRONMENT TO SPRING 
FORTH IN IRVINGTON.
ANY OTHER COMMISSIONER
19:45:21 S, 
COMMISSIONER STECKLER YOU HAVE 
COMMENTS
19:45:25 ?
>> Commissioner Steckler:   
THANK YOU, CHAIR
19:45:28 .
I THINK THE PROJECT'S A GOOD 
PROJECT.

19:45:31 I'LL VOTE FOR IT.
BUT THE TRAFFIC ISSUE
19:45:34  IS REAL.
AND WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN, I 
MEAN
19:45:38  THE DYNAMICS THAT GO ON 
BECAUSE WE HAD TO DEAL WITH
19:45:42  IT 
FOR 36 YEARS I WAS HERE
19:45:46 .
THE PEOPLE THAT LIVE IN THOSE
19:45:50  
UNITS ARE GOING TO PARK AS CLOSE
19:45:53  
TO THEIR UNIT AS THEY CAN.
THAT MIGHT
19:45:57  BE RIGHT OUT FRONT IF 
THERE'S SPACE AVAILABLE OR 
HOWEVER FAR
19:46:00 .
BUT THEY'RE GOING TO PARK AS 
CLOSE AS THEY CAN
19:46:03  TO THAT.
SO WE'RE GOING TO ADD SIX TO 12 
MORE CARS
19:46:06  EVERY DAY.
AND
19:46:10  AS COMMISSIONER YEE POINTED 
OUT
19:46:13 , WE HAVE THE FARMERS MARKET
19:46:16  
ON SUNDAYS.
WE ALSO HAVE THE IRVINGTON 

19:46:19 MOSQUE WHERE EVERY FRIDAY THE 
PARKING IS JAMMED THROUGHOUT 
THAT WHOLE AREA
19:46:22  FOR THE 
AFTERNOON.
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, THE PEOPLE 

19:46:25 ARE GOING IN FOR THEIR PRAYERS.
SO THAT'S
19:46:29  TWO DAYS A WEEK THAT 
PARKING IS GOING TO BE AT A
19:46:32  
PREMIUM.
19:46:37 
SO I KNOW THE DYNAMICS OF 
PARKING.

19:46:40 THEY'RE GOING TO PARK AS CLOSE 
AS THEY CAN.
19:46:43 
IF THERE'S AN OPEN PLACE ON THE
19:46:46  
STREET BOOM THAT'S WHERE THEY'RE 
GOING TO PARK
19:46:49  THEIR CAR.
SO SOMEBODY IS GOING
19:46:52  TO GET 
DISPLACED, THE PEOPLE WHO
19:46:56  BOUGHT 
THESE CONDOS OR THE BUSINESSES 
IN THE AREA ARE
19:46:59  GOING TO GET 
DISPLACED, THAT IS
19:47:02  GOING TO BE 
THE PROBLEM.
WE ARE GOING
19:47:05  TO GET THE PROBLEM 
I SAY WE, THE POLICE DEPARTMENT 
IS GOING
19:47:08  TO GET THE PROBLEM, AND 
WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO DO THEY
19:47:12  
ARE GOING TO REQUEST PERMIT 
PARKING AND RESTRICT
19:47:14 ED PARKING.
ALL THAT STUFF.
I DON'T HAVE TO DEAL WITH IT.
19:47:18 
I DEALT WITH IT BEFORE.
THAT IS NOW SEAN'S PROBLEM BUT
19:47:20  
IN MY VIEW THAT'S GOING TO BE AN 
ISSUE.

19:47:23 I THINK THE PROJECT'S GOOD.
I THINK THE INTENT
19:47:26  OF THE 
DEVELOPER IS
19:47:29  MARVELOUS.
YOU KNOW, WE DID SOMETHING
19:47:32  
SIMILAR FOR CENTERVILLE
19:47:36  
PRESBYTERIAN WHEN WE APPROVED 
SOME HOUSING OVER
19:47:39  ON -- BY THE 
CEMETERY
19:47:43  IN CENTERVILLE, IT WAS 
RESTRICTED OR SET ASIDE FOR
19:47:45  
PEOPLE THAT WORKED AT THE 
CHURCH.

19:47:48 SO I THINK IT'S A MARVELOUS 
PROJECT,
19:47:51  JUT CONCERNED ABOUT THE 
PARKING.
THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO 

19:47:54 SPEAK.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   THANK 
YOU, COMMISSIONER STECKLER
19:47:58 .
BEN I SEE YOU HAVE YOUR HAND UP 
AGAIN.
19:48:00 
GO AHEAD.
>> Commissioner Yee:   THIS IS 

19:48:03 ACTUALLY A QUESTION MORE FOR 
STAFF.
I KNOW THAT THERE'S
19:48:06  THE 
AFFORDABLE APARTMENTS
19:48:09  ACROSS THE 
STREET.
I KNOW THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO HAVE 

19:48:12 THEIR OWN PARKING LOT.
I WAS TOLD THAT THEY SHOULD BE 
ABLE TO UTILIZE THE PARK
19:48:16 ING 
SPACES THAT THEY HAVE ONSITE 
THERE
19:48:20  BUT UNFORTUNATELY IT 
SOUNDS LIKE MANY OF THE PEOPLE 
THAT
19:48:23  LIVE NEAR BAY STREET PARK 
ALONG BAY
19:48:26  STREET RATHER THAN 
PARKING IN THEIR PARKING LOT.
COULD YOU --
19:48:29  ANY OF YOU FROM 
STAFF ELABORATE ON THAT
19:48:34 ?

19:48:37 >> I THINK
19:48:41  JOEL IS ON MUTE.
>> Planner Pullen:   SOMEBODY 
MUTE
19:48:44 ED ME ON SCREEN.
I USED MY PHONE TO MUTE
19:48:47  AND I 
THINK SOMEBODY WAS TRYING TO DO 
ME A FAVOR.

19:48:50 SO I CAN'T -- I DON'T KNOW THE 
SPECIFICS OF THE
19:48:53  FOLKS IN THE 
ADJACENT RESIDENTIAL.
THERE ARE SEVERAL
19:48:56  DEVELOPMENTS 
FURTHER DOWN BAY STREET AND 
THERE'S
19:49:00  ONE THAT'S KIND OF AT AN 
ANGLE ON BAY STREET THERE
19:49:03 .
I DON'T KNOW THE SPECIFICS OF 
THAT BUT YOU KNOW THE POINT
19:49:06  CAME 
UP EARLIER COMMISSIONER STECKLER 
MADE, PEOPLE
19:49:10  WILL PARK WHERE 
IT'S MOST CONVENIENT FOR THEM TO 
PARK AND
19:49:13  THAT'S TRUE OF ALL 
USERS, RIGHT?
YOU KNOW, IF YOU CAN PARK
19:49:16  IN 
FRONT OF YOUR HOUSE, YOU WILL 
AND IF YOU CAN PARK IN
19:49:19  FRONT OF 
THE BUSINESS YOU'RE GOING TO, 
YOU WILL.
19:49:22 
AND THAT RESULTS IN
19:49:25  CHOICES MADE 
THAT LONG TERM
19:49:30  SUPPORT MODE 
OPTIONS ARE ESSENTIAL TO A
19:49:33  
THRIVING URBAN AREA.
SO IF THAT BASED
19:49:36  ON THE STREET 
MOVES UP, THE PEOPLE PARKING ON 
THE
19:49:39  STREET THERE WILL MAKE IT 
LESS CONVENIENT AND
19:49:42  MAKE SET OF 
THEIR ONSITE SPACES THAT ARE SET
19:49:45  
ASIDE FOR THEIR USE AND IT'S A 
DANCE.

19:49:48 WE TRY TO -- IF WE BUILD THE 
MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF PARK
19:49:51 ING FOR 
EVERYBODY, EVERYBODY WILL MAKE
19:49:54  
IT MORE CONVENIENT TO USE
19:49:57  CARS  
MORE OF THE TIME.
TRYING
19:50:00  TO PUSH THAT ENVELOPE 
TAKE US TO THAT STRATEGICALLY 
URBAN
19:50:04  MODEL, AND IT'S A GOAL FOR
19:50:07  
THE CITY TO ACCOMPLISH THAT
19:50:11 .
19:50:13 
>> Commissioner Yee:   THANK 
YOU.

19:50:16 >> Commissioner Daulton:   I 
WOULD ADD ALSO THAT IF WE
19:50:19  EVER 
EXPECT PEOPLE TO
19:50:23  CONSIDER 
ALTERNATIVES
19:50:26  TO THE AUTO
19:50:30  CENTRIC 
CULTURE THAT IS MESSING
19:50:33  UP OUR 
TOWN AND MESSING UP THE WORLD
19:50:36 , 
WE HAVE TO GIVE THEM 
OPPORTUNITIES TO DO THAT.

19:50:39 THIS IS TINIEST SLICE OF 
OPPORTUNITY, SIX
19:50:42  CONDOMINIUMS.
I THINK
19:50:45  IT'S DEFINITELY WORTH 
TAKING THIS CHANCE HERE
19:50:48 .
YOU MAY HAVE TO WALK TWO BLOCKS 
TO THE HAIRSTYLE
19:50:52 IST, I KNOW.
YOU MAY HAVE TO TAKE AN
19:50:54  UBER TO 
THE CHIROPRACTOR.
I UNDERSTAND.

19:50:57 THIS IS THE NATURE OF
19:51:01  AN URBAN 
SETTING, WHICH THERE'S JUST NO 
QUESTION
19:51:04 , IRVINGTON, AT FIVE 
CORNERS, IS
19:51:07  GOING TO BECOME AN 
URBAN SETTING.
SO I HOPE
19:51:10  THE COMMISSION WILL 
JOIN ME IN APPROVING THIS 
PROJECT
19:51:13 .
SO WITH THAT BEING SAID, AND IF 
THERE ARE NO
19:51:18  FURTHER COMMENTS, 
I'D LIKE TO CALL FOR A MOTION 
FROM THE COMMISSIONER
19:51:21 S.

19:51:25 >> Commissioner Steckler:   I'LL 
MAKE A MOTION TO ACCEPT STAFF
19:51:27  
RECOMMENDATION.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   CAN I 

19:51:30 GET A SECOND?
I WILL
19:51:33  SECOND THAT MOTION.

19:51:40 SO WE HAVE A MOTION AND SECOND.

PROBABLY HAS MORE INFORMATION 
FOR YOU
19:55:03 .
>> Commissioner Daulton:   OKAY 
THANK YOU JOEL.

19:55:10 >> GOOD EVENING, COMMISSIONERS.
THE PROJECT TONIGHT IS
19:55:13  TO ADD 
HYDROGEN FUELING DISPENSE
19:55:16 ERS AT 
AN EXISTING GAS STATION AT THE 
CORNL
19:55:19 ER OF WARM SPRINGS 
BOULEVARD
19:55:23  AND GABLE DRIVE IN THE
19:55:24  
WARM SPRINGS DISTRICT OF 
FREMONT.

19:55:27 WHAT'S ON THE SCREEN NOW IS A 
SITE PLAN OF THE SITE.
19:55:31 
THE HYDROGEN
19:55:35  WOULD BE STORED IN 
TANKS IN AN ENCLOSURE LOCATED
19:55:36  AT 
THE SOUTHERN END OF THE 
PROPERTY.

19:55:39 AND THE HYDROGEN DISPENSARIES
19:55:44  HIDE
19:55:48  YEN DISPENSERS 
WOULD BE LOCATED IN THE AREA
19:55:52  
EVER DISPENSERS, THE PROJECT
19:55:55  
WOULD
19:55:58  RELOCATE AND ADD WALLS AND 
LANDSCAPING TO HELP SCREEN
19:56:01  THE 
EQUIPMENT FROM WARM SPRINGS 
BOULEVARD
19:56:04 .
ALSO PART OF THE PROJECT THE 
APPLICANT WOULD BE RESTORING
19:56:07  ALL 
LANDSCAPING AT THE SITE 
INCLUDING AREAS THAT ARE 

19:56:11 SUPPOSED TO BE LANDSCAPED BUT 
THE LANDSCAPING
19:56:14  HAS NOT BEEN 
MAINTAINED PROPERLY.

19:56:19 SO IF THE COMMISSIONERS HAVE ANY 
QUESTIONS I'M AVAILABLE TO 
ANSWER
19:56:22  THEM, AS IS OUR CITY FIRE 
MARSHAL
19:56:28  JAY
19:56:31  SWARDENSKI AND THE 
APPLICANT HAS A
19:56:34  PRESENTATION TO 
MAKE.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   DO WE 

19:56:37 HAVE ANY CLARIFYING QUESTIONS 
FROM THE COMMISSIONERS OR STAFF?
I
19:56:42  GUESS COMMISSIONER YEE PLEASE.

19:56:46 >> Commissioner Yee:   YEAH, YOU 
KNOW,
19:56:49  I'VE ACTUALLY SEEN THIS 
GAS STATION WHEN IT WAS
19:56:52  FIRST 
BUILT ALL THOSE YEARS AGO.
I'VE BEEN HERE A LONG
19:56:55  TIME.
BUT I'M JUST WONDERING IN TERMS
19:56:58  
OF THE HYDROGEN TANK, THE AMOUNT 
OF
19:57:02  HYDROGEN BEING STORED, IF 
THEY WERE TO
19:57:06  SOMEHOW, WEREN'T 
CONTAINED, THE
19:57:09  EXPLOSIVE FORCE, 
HOW WOULD THAT COMPARE TO THE 
GAS TANKS THAT ARE
19:57:12  THERE 
CURRENTLY RIGHT NOW?
19:57:15 
>> I DON'T BELIEVE THERE'S BEEN 
ANY ANALYSIS OF THE SAFETY OF 

19:57:19 THE EXISTING GASOLINE TANKS 
WHICH ARE UNDERGROUND.
WITH IT
19:57:23  HYDROGEN SYSTEM THERE 
ARE SIGNIFICANT SAFEGUARDS
19:57:27  TO 
PREVENT ANY KIND OF AN EXPLOSION
19:57:31 
EXPLOSION.
AN OFFSITE CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS 

19:57:34 WAS PREPARED FOR THIS PROJECT 
AND REVIEWED BY
19:57:37  OUR FIRE MAR 
19:57:41  
SHALL AND THE FREMONT FIRE 
DEPARTMENT
19:57:45  AND IT WAS FOUNDER 
THAT ANY POSSIBILITY OF 
EXPLOSION AT THE
19:57:48  CITE WAS 
EXTREMELY REMOTE IN THE I 
BELIEVE
19:57:51  MILLIONS TO ONE AS I 
RECALL.
BUT I'D HAVE TO LOOK AT THE 

19:57:54 REPORT AGAIN TO SEE EXACTLY WHAT 
IT WAS.
BUT IT
19:57:57  WAS EXTREMELY REMOTE FOR 
ANYTHING THAT COULD HAPPEN AT 
THE SITE THAT WOULD
19:58:00  HAVE OFFSITE 
CONSEQUENCES DUE TO THE BUILT-IN
19:58:03  
SAFETY FEATURES WHICH ARE ALL 
REQUIRED BY
19:58:07  CODE UNDER THE STATE 
FIRE AND BUILDING
19:58:10  CODES.
>> Commissioner Yee:  
19:58:13  YES, I 
SAW THAT.
I'M JUST TRYING TO DETERMINE YOU
19:58:16  
KNOW THE EXPLOSIVE FORCE
19:58:19  
POTENTIAL OF THESE HYDROGEN 
TANKS RELATIVE
19:58:23  TO THE GAS TANKS 
THAT ARE THERE.
I'M JUST GOING TO GUESS THAT THE
19:58:26  
GAS TANKS HAVE A MUCH MORE 
EXPLOSIVE POTENTIAL
19:58:29  THAN THESE 
HYDROGEN TANKS
19:58:33 .
JUST BY THE SHEER QUANTITY OF 
GASOLINE VERSUS THE
19:58:36  HYDROGEN 
TANKS
19:58:39 .
>> Commissioner Daulton:   ALL 
RIGHT
19:58:43 .
19:58:47 
CHAIR WOULD LIKE TO RECOGNIZE 
COMMISSIONER ZHANG
19:58:50 .
>> Commissioner Zhang:   I JUST 
WANT TO KNOW, ANY CODE
19:58:55  OR 
REGULATION ABOUT
19:58:58  HOW FAR THIS 
TANK SHOULD BE
19:59:01  AWAY FROM 
RESIDENCE?
>> THERE ARE CODE REQUIREMENTS
19:59:04  
FOR DISTANCE BETWEEN BUILDINGS.
AND
19:59:07  VENTILATION OPENINGS.
THE TANKS, AS
19:59:10  DESIGNED, ARE FAR 
ENOUGH AWAY FROM THE
19:59:14  BUILDINGS 
ONSITE AND OFFSITE TO MEET CODE.
THE NEAR
19:59:17 EST RESIDENCES ARE 
ACROSS GABLE DRIVE WHICH
19:59:20  MAKES 
THEM MUCH FURTHER AWAY THAN EVEN 
THE BUILDINGS ON THE
19:59:23  ADJACENT 
LOT AND THE EXISTING CONVENIENCE 
STORE
19:59:27  OF THE GAS STATION.

19:59:33 >> Commissioner Zhang:   BUT 
NEXT TO THE SITE IS A DAYCARE
19:59:36  IF 
I RECALL CORRECTLY, AND NOT TOO 
FAR AWAY THERE IS
19:59:39  ALSO A CALL 
CALLER
19:59:42  WHICH IS AN EDUCATION 
SITE.
19:59:46 
THERE ARE ALWAYS KIDS AROUND.
IS THAT A CONCERN?
19:59:49 
>> BASED ON THE OFFSITE 
CONSEQUENCE ANALYSIS IT WAS
19:59:53  NOT 
A SIGNIFICANT CONCERN.
THERE ARE ENOUGH SAFEGUARDS 

19:59:57 BUILT INTO THIS SYSTEM THAT 
WOULD PREVENT ANY OFF
20:00:00 SITE 
INCIDENTS.
MOST OF THE POTENTIAL
20:00:03  ACCIDENTS 
RESULTING IN THIS WERE SIMILAR 
TO WHAT YOU WOULD
20:00:06  FIND AT A GAS 
STATION.
SOMEONE DRIVING OFF WITH THE 

20:00:09 NOZZLE STILL IN THEIR CAR, 
DAMAGING THE PUMP ITSELF
20:00:12 , THEY 
ALL HAVE SAFEGUARDS THAT WOULD 
PREVENT
20:00:15  THE LEAK FROM CONTINUING 
AS SOON AS
20:00:19  IT DETECT
20:00:22 ED THE 
PRESSURE LOSS.
BUT
20:00:25  THERE IS NOTHING THAT IS 
LIKELY TO BE THAT WOULD CAUSE 
ANY
20:00:28  SIGNIFICANT FIRES OR 
RELEASES DUE TO THE BUILT-IN
20:00:31  
SAFEGUARDS AND OUR FIRE MARSHAL 
COULD
20:00:34  PROBABLY SPEAK BETTER TO 
THAT THAN I COULD.
20:00:38 
>> COMMISSIONERS, THIS IS JAY 
SWARDENSKI
20:00:41 .
WE DID GET A CHANCE TO REVIEW 
AND TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS
20:00:44  
THERE ARE SET BACK REQUIREMENTS 
FOR HYDROGEN
20:00:47  SYSTEMS.
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IS ALWAYS 
A CHALLENGE
20:00:50  IS THOSE SETBACKS 
WHICH YOU'LL SEE
20:00:54  THE ENCLOSURE 
FOR THE TANK ITSELF AS WELL AS
20:00:57  A 
MASONRY WALL FROM THE PROPERTY 
LINE IT CUTS
20:01:02  THE
20:01:06  DISTANCE THAT 
WOULD BE IN THE ADJACENT 
BUSINESS.

20:01:09 WE TOOK A PRETTY DEEP DIVE INTO 
THE CODE COMPLIANCE ON THE
20:01:13  WHOLE 
SYSTEM.
EVEN AS PART OF THE ENTITLEMENT
20:01:16  
HERE THAT WE'RE REVIEWING.
AND FOUND THAT THERE'S A
20:01:19  VERY 
HIGH DEGREE OF CONFIDENCE THAT 
IT'S
20:01:22  GOING TO BE 100% COMPLIANT 
INSTALLATION.
WE
20:01:25  STILL GOT ANOTHER SHOT AT IT 
WITH THE TENANT GROUP AND
20:01:28  THE 
BUILDING PERMITS, WHICH WE WOULD 
ANTICIPATE
20:01:31  COMING FOLLOWING ON 
THE HEELS OF TONIGHT'S 
PRESENTATION.

20:01:37 >> AND THE --
>> I'M SORRY.
20:01:40 
>> GO AHEAD.
THE MASONRY
20:01:43  WALL THAT FIRE 
MARSHAL
20:01:48  SWARDENSKI IS REFERRING 
TO IS THE HEAVY BLACK LINE 
BEHIND
20:01:51  THE ENCLOSURE, THIS IS 
NEAREST BUILDING TO THE 
ENCLOSURE
20:01:54  WHICH IS ON THE 
ADJACENT LOT.
THIS IS ON THE BACK SIDE OF THE
20:01:58  
COMMERCIAL BUILDING.
20:02:01 
>> Commissioner Zhang:   I'M 
LESS CONCERNED ABOUT EXPLOSIVE, 

20:02:05 MORE LIKE A GAS LEAKING.
LIKE IF IT'S
20:02:08  SO CLOSE THAT IT'S 
A SLOW
20:02:11  LEAK MIKE CAUSE SOME 
ISSUES?
20:02:14 
>> THE APPLICANT WOULD BE ABLE 
TO DESCRIBE THE NATURE
20:02:17  OF 
HYDROGEN BETTER THAN I COULD BUT 
HYDROGEN
20:02:21  IS LESS DENSE THAN 
NORMAL ATMOSPHERE.
20:02:24 
ANY LEAK, SLOW LEAK OR ANYTHING 
WOULD BE DETECT
20:02:27 ED BY THE SAFETY 
SYSTEMS.
BUT EVEN IF IT WERE TO
20:02:30  CONTINUE, 
IT WOULD BASICALLY BE GOING 
STRAIGHT UP AT A
20:02:34  HIGH RATE OF 
SPEED AND LEAVE THE ATMOSPHERE.
IT
20:02:37  DOESN'T LINGER OR COLLECT ON 
THE GROUND BECAUSE OF
20:02:40  ITS 
DENSITY.
IT'S MORE BUOYANT THAN AIR
20:02:43  SO IT 
GOES UP.
I DOESN'T HANG AROUND
20:02:47  AT THE 
GROUND LEVEL.
20:02:49 
>> Commissioner Zhang:   THANK 
YOU.

20:02:52 >> Planner Pullen:   I'D LIKE TO 
ADD IN ON WHAT SCWHRAIMS
20:02:55  JAMES OR JAY SAID
20:02:58 
SAID, THIS IS SOMETHING WE 
EXPECT TO SEE MORE AN MORE 

20:03:02 AROUND THE CITY OF FREMONT AND 
WE'RE SEEING AROUND THE WORLD.
GAS STATIONS HAVE
20:03:05  BEEN 
TRADITIONAL ON
20:03:09  STREET CORNERS 
ACROSS FROM COMMERCIAL
20:03:12 , 
RESIDENTIAL USES ALL AROUND THE 
CITY OF FREMONT
20:03:15 .
WE'VE SEEN IN PARTS OF THE 
COUNTRY AND OVERSEAS
20:03:19  WEIR SEEING 
ELECTRICAL CHARGING 
INFRASTRUCTURE,
20:03:23  REPLACING GAS 
STATIONS OR BEING ADDED TO GAS 
STATIONS.
20:03:25 
WE HAVE A PROPOSAL FOR THAT IN 
TOWN.

20:03:29 WE HAVE AN EXISTING
20:03:32  HYDROGEN 
PORTION OF
20:03:35  A
20:03:38  PROGRAM AT GRIMMER 
ACROSS FROM IRVINGTON HIGH 
SCHOOL AND NEXT TO
20:03:42  A CHILDCARE 
FACILITY.
SO THIS IS AN ESTABLISHED
20:03:45  
TECHNOLOGY AND IS PART OF A 
RANGE OF ENERGY OPTIONS
20:03:48  THAT WE 
EXPECT TO BE VERY COMMON
20:03:52  TO THE 
BEING
20:03:58  BE 
ADDED TO AND DISPLACED
20:04:01  BY 
GASOLINE
20:04:06  FACILITIES.
>> Commissioner Daulton:  
20:04:09  OKAY 
CHAIR RECOGNIZES COMMISSIONER 
LIU.
20:04:12 
>> Commissioner Liu:   OKAY SO 
THE PROPANE GAS
20:04:15  TANK ON 
FORKLIFTS, THEY ALL HAVE A
20:04:17  SHELF 
LIFE.
AFTER A CERTAIN NUMBER OF YEARS 

20:04:21 THE PROPANE GAS STATION WOULD 
NOT REFUEL
20:04:25  THOSE PROPANE GAS 
TANKS
20:04:28 .
AND DO WE HAVE A SIMILAR TYPE OF
20:04:33  
LIFE EXPECTANCY
20:04:36 ,
20:04:39  FOR HYDROGEN 
TANKS LIKE THESE?
AND
20:04:42  HOW LONG ARE THEY GOOD FOR?
>> THAT WOULD BE A
20:04:45  QUESTION MORE 
FOR APPLICANT, WOULD BE MORE 
FAMILIAR
20:04:49  WITH MATERIALS IN 
CONSTRUCTION.
BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE
20:04:52  THAT 
EVEN THE UNDERGROUND GASOLINE 
TANKS HAVE TO BE REPLACED
20:04:55  
OCCASIONALLY.
YOU'LL SOMETIMES SEE A GAS 

20:04:58 STATION CLOSED FOR WEEKS WHILE 
THEY DIG UP THE TANKS AND 
REPLACE
20:05:01  THEM.
SO ONGOING MAINTENANCE IS 
ACTUALLY PROBABLY
20:05:05  A LITTLE 
BITTEST
20:05:08  LITTLE BIT 
EASIER BECAUSE IT IS
20:05:11  AN ABOVE 
GROUND
20:05:17  FACILITY BUT I DO NOT 
KNOW.
THAT
20:05:20  WOULD PROBABLY BE THE 
QUESTION FOR THE APPLICANT
20:05:24 .
>> Commissioner Liu:   THANK 
YOU.

20:05:27 >> Commissioner Daulton:   CAN 
WE GET THE APPLICANT TO
20:05:29  GIVE A 
PRESENTATION?
YOU HAVE TEN MINUTES TO DO SO.

20:05:35 >> HI, CAN YOU HEAR ME OKAY?
>> Commissioner Daulton:   YES.
20:05:39 
>> PERFECT, GREAT.
MY NAME IS STEVE
20:05:42  ELLIS, I'M THE 
MERK OF OUTREACH AND 
COMMUNICATION
20:05:45  WITH FIRST ELEMENT 
FUEL AND WE JUST HAVE A BRIEF 
OVER
20:05:48 VIEW OF THE STATION THEN I 
WILL -- AND OUR COMPANY AND I 
WILL
20:05:51  PASS THIS ON TO
20:05:58  LOGAN 
DILTS, CERTAINLY
20:06:01  WE HAVE OTHERS 
HERE TONIGHT THAT CAN ANSWER
20:06:05  
QUESTIONS THAT MAY COME UP OR 
MAY HAVE ALREADY COME UP.

20:06:08 SO LET'S JUST START WITH THE 
NEXT SLIDE.

20:06:14 SO FIRST ELEMENT FUEL IS A 
CALIFORNIA BASED COMPANY,
20:06:17  WE 
WERE FIRST ESTABLISHED IN
20:06:21  2013 
WITH A GOAL OF BRINGING ZERO 
EMISSION
20:06:24  ENERGY TO HYDROGEN FUEL 
CELL VEHICLES.
20:06:27 
WE OPERATE STATIONS WITH THE 
CUSTOMER FIRST AND
20:06:31  FOREMOST ON 
OUR MIND.
WE ARE ALSO
20:06:34  THE LARGEST COMPANY 
IN THE WORLD DEDICATED TO
20:06:37  
SELLING RETAIL HYDROGEN.
WE'VE BEEN
20:06:40  AWARDED WELL OVER $
20:06:43 60 
MILLION IN CALIFORNIA STATE
20:06:47  
GRANTS BY NATURE OF THE 
POTENTIAL
20:06:51  FOR AN INCREASED
20:06:55  
BUSINESS IN THE SPACE.
OTHER PRIVATE FINANCING HAS
20:06:58  COME 
FROM TOYOTA, HONDA, MI
20:07:01 TSUI,
20:07:05  AIR 
LIQUID AND OTHER INVESTORS.
WE HAVE
20:07:08  BUILT AS OF TODAY AND 
OPERATE TODAY 36 RETAIL
20:07:11  HYDROGEN 
STATIONS AND WE ARE ADDING IN 
THE NEAR
20:07:14  TERM, 17 ADDITIONAL AND 
OF COURSE LOOK FORWARD
20:07:18  TO FAR 
MORE BEYOND THAT
20:07:21 .
AND THIS AGAIN IS MORE THAN ANY 
OTHER SINGLE COMPANY IN THE
20:07:25  
WORLD.
OUR STATIONS RANGE THROUGHOUT 

20:07:30 CALIFORNIA FROM LOS ANGELES AND 
SAN FRANCISCO AND EVEN LAKE
20:07:33  
TAHOE SO REALLY PROVIDING GREAT 
UTILITY FOR THE
20:07:36  DRIVERS OF FUEL 
CELL ELECTRIC CARS.
WE
20:07:39  LAUNCHED THE TRUE ZERO BRAND, 
THAT'S OUR BRANDING
20:07:42  AT THE 
STATION LOCATIONS, AND NOW THAT 
IS
20:07:45  SYNONYMOUS WITH A GREAT 
SUPERIOR CUSTOMER
20:07:49  EXPERIENCE.
THIS NETWORK REALLY LAID THE
20:07:52  
GROUNDWORK FOR AUTO MAKERS TO BE 
ABLE
20:07:56  TO SELL FUEL CELL CARS IN 
THE CALIFORNIA MARKET
20:07:59  AND TODAY 
THERE IS OVER 13,000 ON
20:08:02  THE 
ROAD.
WE'RE ALSO WORKING VERY 

20:08:06 DILIGENTLY AT BRINGING HEAVY 
DUTY
20:08:10  VEHICLE STATIONS INTO THE 
CALIFORNIA MARKET FOR
20:08:13  TRUCK 
20:08:16  
TRANSPORT.
THAT'S A GROWING INTEREST BY 

20:08:20 PEOPLE IN STATE GOVERNMENT 
AMOUNT OF COURSE THE TRUCKING 
INDUSTRY
20:08:23 .
NEXT SLIDE.
THIS IS JUST AN
20:08:26  IMAGE AND I 
WANTED TO TALK TO THIS ONE 
BECAUSE IT'S AN
20:08:29  IMAGE OF ONE OF 
OUR NEWER LOCATIONS THAT WAS 
BUILT IN
20:08:33  ORANGE COUNTY.
THIS ONE HAS DIFFERENT CANOPIES 
AND
20:08:36  DESIGN ELEMENTS BUT THE 
POINT HERE IS THAT WE
20:08:40  REALLY DID 
DESIGN THESE STATIONS
20:08:43  WITH THE 
CUSTOMER IN MIND FOR CONVENIENCE 
AND
20:08:47  FOR MEETING THEIR UTILITY IN 
THE NEEDS OF ADOPT
20:08:52 ING ZERO 
EMISSION VEHICLES IN THIS
20:08:55  CASE 
FIELD STOCK CARS.
BUT WHAT WE DID IS SHIFTED FROM
20:08:59  
EARLY STATIONS WHICH WAS THE 
SINGLE DISPENSER
20:09:02 , MAYBE A SINGLE 
HOSE TO THESE FOUR
20:09:05  FUELING 
POSITIONS, FOUR DISPENSERS, 
SIDES
20:09:08 , ALLOWING FOUR VEHICLES
20:09:12  TO 
SIMULTANEOUSLY REFILL IN JUST 
THREE TO FIVE MINUTES.
20:09:15 
AND THAT MIMICS THE GASOLINE 
VEHICLE EXPERIENCE
20:09:18 .
SO WE'RE ADVANCING THE 
TECHNOLOGY AS WE GO HERE
20:09:23 .
20:09:27 
NEXT?
TODAY WE STILL GET QUESTIONS
20:09:30  
ABOUT HYDROGEN FUEL VEHICLES, I 
DON'T KNOW IF ANY OF YOU
20:09:33  DRIVE 
THEM YOURSELF.
20:09:36 
BUT THEY ARE ELECTRIC
20:09:39  CARS, THEY 
ARE QUIET AND EFFICIENT,
20:09:43  
COMPARED TO INTERNAL COMBUSTION.
THEY
20:09:47  ARE CERTIFIED AS ZERO 
EMISSION VEHICLES AND THE
20:09:50  FIRST 
CARS REALLY WENT ON SALE IN THIS 
LATEST ROUND OF
20:09:53  ADVANCING THE 
GRET
20:09:56  
GROWTH IN 2015 AFTER TEN YEARS
20:09:59  
OF REAL WORLD TEST EXPERIENCE ON 
THE ROADS.

20:10:02 AND AS I NOTED THE PERFORMANCE 3 
TO 5 MINUTES
20:10:05  TO REFILL ONE, 3 TO 
400 MILES OF
20:10:09  DRIVING RANGE AND 
THE EQUIVALENT TO OF WHAT'S 
REFERRED TO AS 60
20:10:12  TO 70 MILES 
PER GALLON.
AND
20:10:15  THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF SOME 
OF THE VEHICLES TON ROAD.
20:10:20 
NEXT
20:10:26  I'M NOT GOING TO GET INTO 
DETAILS HERE BUT CALIFORNIA HAS 
A
20:10:30  VISION FOR ZERO EMISSION 
VEHICLES, I
20:10:33  ASSUME YOU ALL KNOW 
THAT.
THERE ARE VARIOUS POLICIES SHA 

20:10:36 SUPPORT THAT, FROM AN EXECUTIVE 
ORDER FROM A
20:10:39  PREVIOUS 
ADMINISTRATION, CALLING FOR 5 
MILLION BY
20:10:43  2030.
THE PROGRAMS PROVIDING FUNDING 
FOR STATION
20:10:46 S, $20 MILLION PER 
YEAR TO BUILD ABOUT AND AS
20:10:49  WE 
SPEAK THERE'S NEW LEGISLATION 
BEING ADOPTED
20:10:53  TO ADVANCE THE 
FUNDING FOR STATIONS
20:10:56 .
REGULATIONS, REQUIRING AUTO 
MAKERS TO BRING
20:10:59  ZERO EMISSION 
VEHICLES TO MARKET AND FUNDING
20:11:02  
MADE AVAILABLE THROUGH WHAT'S 
CALLED THE LOW CARBON
20:11:05  FUEL 
STANDARD.
NEXT.
20:11:10 
SO WHAT WE'RE DOING AS YOU'RE 
SEEING WITH
20:11:13  THIS PROJECT IS 
ADDING HYDROGEN
20:11:16  DISPENSING TO 
EXISTING GASOLINE STATIONS
20:11:19 .
THIS REALLY PROVIDES A EVENTUAL 
FUELING EXPERIENCE, SOMETHING
20:11:22  
PEOPLE ARE ALREADY USED TO.
AND EXISTING
20:11:25  INFRASTRUCTURE 
PROVIDES GOOD LIGHTING, 
CONVENIENCE STORE
20:11:28 , AND RESTROOM 
OPERATIONS.
REALLY A TURNKEY
20:11:31  OPERATION.
AND WE HAVE A DEDICATED FIELD 
SERVICE TEAM
20:11:35  THAT WILL HANDLE 
ALL MAINTENANCE AND REPAIRS AT 
THE STATIONS
20:11:38 .

20:11:45 THIS IS AN IMAGE OF THE 
ENCLOSURE THAT WAS REFERENCED 
EARLIER
20:11:49 .
IT HAS THE STORAGE FOR
20:11:52  THE 
HYDROGEN, IT ALSO
20:11:55  STORES, 
COMPRESSES THE HYDROGEN, AND HAS 
CONTROL
20:11:59  SYSTEMS, AS WAS 
MENTIONED EARLIER, THAT IS
20:12:02  
SAFETY BY DESIGN.
AND WE HAVE PEOPLE
20:12:05  THAT CAN GET 
INTO THE DETAILS OF ANY 
QUESTIONS YOU MAY
20:12:08  HAVE THERE.
BUT AN EXAMPLE OF THAT
20:12:12  IS THE 
VALVES THAT PROVIDE FOR OR ALLOW 
THE FLOW OF
20:12:15  HYDROGEN IN ITS 
VARIOUS STATES
20:12:18  ARE NORMALLY 
CLOSED VALVES THAT ARE ONLY OPEN 
WHEN ALL THE CONTROL SYSTEMS
20:12:21  SAY 
THAT EVERYTHING IS OKAY.
SO SIMPLY PUT IF
20:12:24  SOMETHING IS 
DETECTED AS A PROBLEM, ALL
20:12:27  OF 
THESE VALVES BEING NORMALLY
20:12:31  
CLOSED VALVES ARE CLOSED SO 
THERE CAN'T BE ANY FLOW
20:12:33  OR 
LEAKAGE.
NEXT SLIDE.

20:12:36 AND I'LL PASS THIS ON TO LOGAN 
TO TALK MORE
20:12:39  ABOUT THE PROJECT 
AND THEN WE CAN WRAP UP THERE 
THERE, THANK YOU
20:12:44 .
>> THANK YOU STEVE AND THANK YOU 
JAMES FOR THE
20:12:48  INITIAL 
PRESENTATION.
I JUST WANTED TO TOUCH ON A 

20:12:51 COUPLE OF THINGS HERE THAT MIGHT 
NOT HAVE BEEN MENTIONED EARLIER.
20:12:54 
NUMBER 1 IS THE ACTUAL FUEL 
CANOPY IS GOING TO BE
20:12:58  REPLACED 
AS PART OF THIS PROJECT SO WE 
GET A
20:13:01  NICE FRESH CANOPY FOR THE 
SITE THERE.
AND HERE ARE THE
20:13:04  TWO DOUBLE 
SIDED DISPENSERS.
AND I WOULD NOTE THAT
20:13:07  YOU 
CAN'T -- THERE AREN'T THREE 
SEPARATE FUELING POSITIONS
20:13:10  HERE.
THERE'S ONLY TWO.
SO SOMEONE COULD FILL UP
20:13:14  WITH 
GAS OR HYDROGEN.
THEY COULDN'T DO BOTH
20:13:17 .
SO JUST SOMETHING TO NOTE
20:13:21 .
20:13:27 
THE OTHERS THING IS AS PART OF 
THIS PROJECT WE DO
20:13:30  NEED 
ADDITIONAL POWER.
WE HAVE THESE HEDGES THAT WILL
20:13:33  
KIND OF PROTECT, SCREEN THAT 
FROM VIEW FROM THE
20:13:36  STREET AND 
THEN JAMES MENTIONED THE WALL 
HERE THAT SEPARATES
20:13:40  THE 
TRANSFORMER FROM THE PROPANE 
THEN WE'VE GOT A
20:13:43  CUSTOM PARKING 
SPOTS AND THEN HERE IS THE MAIN 
HYDROGEN
20:13:46  EQUIPMENT AND ENCLOSURE 
AND THAT CMU WALL FOR
20:13:50  JUST SOME 
ADDED SAFETY PROTECTION FOR
20:13:53  
THESE BUSINESSES OVER HERE.
20:14:11

CHAIR.
ONE MOMENT.

20:30:01 ALL RIGHT SO TONIGHT'S ITEM, 
THIRD ITEM IS OUR
20:30:05  OUTDOOR 
COMMERCIAL PATIO ORDINANCE,
20:30:08  THIS 
IS A CITYWIDE ITEM,
20:30:12  IT IS 
APPLICABLE THROUGHOUT THE CITY 
OF FREMONT, TO CONSIDER AN
20:30:17 
ORDINANCE AMENDING TITLE 12,
CHAPTER 12.05 (ENCROACHMENTS TO
20:30:20 
STREETS AND SIDEWALKS) AND TITLE
18, CHAPTERS 18.25 (DEFINITIONS)

20:30:23 AND 18.190 (SPECIAL PROVISIONS
APPLYING TO MISCELLANEOUS USES),
TO ALLOW OUTDOOR COMMERCIAL

20:30:26 PATIOS ON CITY-OWNED AND PRIVATE
PROPERTY, AND A FINDING THAT THE
AMENDMENTS ARE EXEMPT FROM THE
20:30:33 
CEQA, THE GENERAL PROVISION OF 
CEQA THAT THERE IS NO 

20:30:36 POSSIBILITY OF CAUSING A 
SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON THE 
ENVIRONMENT
20:30:40  AND ALSO CONSISTENT 
WITH THE GENERAL PLAN.

20:30:45 SO TONIGHT WE HAVE AGAIN 
COURTNEY PAL ASSOCIATE
20:30:48  PLANNER 
ON THE FIRST PRESENTATION IS
20:30:52  
BACK FOR THIS PRESENTATION.
I'LL DEFER TO HER, THERE IS
20:30:55  NO 
APPLICANT OTHER THAN THE CITY 
TONIGHT, THIS IS A CITY
20:30:58 
CITY-SPONSORED ITEM.

20:31:07 >> GREAT, GOOD EVENING ONCE 
AGAIN COMMISSIONERS.
GOT
20:31:11  THE PRESENTATION UP, 
WONDERFUL.
AS YOU KNOW MY NAME
20:31:14  IS COURTNEY 
PAL AND I'M THE MANAGER WHO HAS
20:31:24  STAFF MEMBER 
WHO'S BEEN MANAGING
20:31:27  THE POP 
PROGRAM AS WE AFFECTIONATE
20:31:29 LY 
CALL IT.
TO ALLOW BUSINESSES TO DEVELOP 

20:31:33 AND TO OPERATE TEMPORARY OUTDOOR  
PATIO AREAS
20:31:36  IN CONFORMANCE WITH 
COUNTY REGULATIONS TO LIMIT THE 
SPRID
20:31:39  THE
20:31:43  
SPREAD OF COVID-19.
TONIGHT THE CITY
20:31:47  IS CONSIDERING 
AN OUTDOOR COMMERCIAL ORDINANCE 
THAT
20:31:50  WOULD ALLOW THESE PAD YOAS 
AND OTHERS TO OPERATE LONG TERM.
20:31:53 
SO MY PRESENTATION TONIGHT IS 
GOING TO BEGIN WITH SOME
20:31:57  
BACKGROUND ON THE POP PROGRAM
20:32:00 .
I'LL DISCUSS OUR PROGRAM WITH 
BUSINESSES TO HELP INFORM
20:32:04  THE 
DEVELOPMENT OF LONG TERM 
REGULATIONS, I'LL HIGHLIGHT
20:32:07  SOME 
KEY AREAS OF THE ORDINANCE WHERE 
WE'RE MAKING CHANGES BASED ON
20:32:10  
WHAT WE'VE LEARNED FROM THE 
TEMPORARY POP PROGRAM
20:32:14 .
SO LETS GET STARTED
20:32:18 .
AS YOU MAY
20:32:21  BE FAMILIAR, THE POP 
UP PATIO
20:32:24  PROGRAM WAS INSTITUTED 
REALLY AS A RAPID RESPONSE
20:32:28  TO 
STATE AND COUNTY WIDE 
REGULATIONS THAT
20:32:31  LIMIT INDOOR 
ACTIVITIES TO HELP PREVENT
20:32:34  THE 
SPREAD OF COVID-19 AND THE
20:32:38  
PROGRAM ALLOWED BUSINESSES TO 
CREATE AREAS FOR OUTDOOR
20:32:41  
OPERATIONS THROUGH CITY'S 
EXISTING SPECIAL EVENTS
20:32:44  PERMIT 
PROCESS.
SO THESE WERE PERMITS THAT WERE 

20:32:47 RELATIVELY FAST TO ISSUE AND 
REALLY FAST TO RESPOND TO
20:32:50  
BUSINESSES NEEDS TO REOPEN TO 
START HAVING CUSTOMERS COME
20:32:52  IN 
AGAIN.
THROUGH THESE PERMITS OUTDOOR 

20:32:56 AREAS COULD BE CREATED EITHER 
WITHIN PRIVATE PROPERTY, OR
20:32:59  ON 
CITY OWNED PROPERTY, LIKE ON 
SIDEWALKS OR
20:33:02  OR ONSTREET PARKING 
STALLS.
AND OUT
20:33:05 DOOR AREAS COULD REALLY 
BEGIN OPERATION AS SOON AS THEY
20:33:08  
RECEIVED AN INSPECTION.
THE PROGRAM HAS NOW
20:33:11  BEEN 
OPERATING FOR A LITTLE BIT MORE 
THAN 22 MONTHS AND DURING
20:33:14  THAT 
TIME,
20:33:18  WE'VE HAD MORE THAN 70 
BUSINESSES RECEIVE
20:33:21  PERMITS FOR A 
POP UP PATIO.
THAT INCLUDED
20:33:24  NOT ONLY 
RESTAURANTS WHICH IS YOUR 
TYPICAL
20:33:27  OUTDOOR DINING USE BUT 
PERSONAL SERVICES
20:33:31  USE HAIR 
DRESSERS AND NAIL
20:33:34  SALONS WERE 
ALLOWED TO OPERATE OUTSIDE, AS 
WELL AS FIT
20:33:37 NESS BUSINESSES 
CHILDCARE CENTERS AND OTHER 
EDUCATIONAL
20:33:41  PROVIDERS WHO 
DECIDED TO TAKE THEIR USES
20:33:43  
OUTSIDE TO LIMIT THE SPREAD OF 
COVID.

20:33:46 ONE THING THAT'S UNIQUE ABOUT 
FREMONT'S POP UP PATIO
20:33:49  PROGRAM 
COMPARED TO OTHER CITIES IN THE 
BAY AREA IS ABOUT HOW MANY 

20:33:53 PATIOS WERE CONSTRUCTED ON 
PRIVATE PROPERTY.
THAT'S
20:33:56  OVER 96% OF OUR PERMIT 
APPLICANTS
20:34:00 .
AND SO IN OTHER CITIES YOU WILL
20:34:03  
HEAR ABOUT FAT YOAS THAT ARE 
MORE COMMON ON STREETS WITH ON
20:34:06  
STREET PARKING SPACES AND 
SIDEWALKS AND WHILE WE WANT
20:34:09  TO 
ENCOURAGE THOSE PATIOS TOO AND 
THERE ARE
20:34:13  GREAT EXAMPLES IN 
FREMONT JUST A VAST MAJORITY 
WERE
20:34:16  TAKING PLACE ON PRIVATE 
PROPERTY IN OUR CITY WHICH
20:34:20  
PROVIDES IMPORTANT CONTEXT
20:34:23  FOR 
THE PROGRAM.
SO THE POP UP PATIO PROGRAM WAS
20:34:26  
CONSISTENT AT THE START OF THE 
PANDEMIC PROVIDING
20:34:30  FOR VARIETY 
OF BUSINESSES.
HOWEVER WE
20:34:33  ARE ALMOST TWO YEARS 
INTO THE PANDEMIC AND IT IS 
CLEAR
20:34:37  THAT THE BUSINESS HAS 
CHANGED
20:34:41 .
BASED ON A SURVEY THAT I'LL TALK 
ABOUT MORE LATER
20:34:44  ON WE THINK 
ABOUT 50% OF FERMENTED POP
20:34:47  UP 
PATIOS ARE STILL OPERATING AND 
THAT NUMBER MAY
20:34:50  BE EVEN LOWER, 
DURING THE
20:34:53  COLD WINTER WEATHER 
THAT WE ARE HAVING TODAY.
MANY
20:34:56  BUSINESSES THAT HAD POP UP 
PAD YOAS WERE BUSINESS
20:34:59  TYPES 
THAT WANTED TO HAVE OUT
20:35:03 DOOR 
BUSINESS LONG TERM, LIKE HAIR 
SALON
20:35:06 S AND NAIL SALONS AND WE 
KIND OF EXPECTED
20:35:10  THAT AS SOON AS 
INDOOR OPERATIONS WERE ONCE 
AGAIN PERMITTED
20:35:13  THOSE BUSINESSES 
WOULD OBVIOUSLY CHOOSE TO NO
20:35:17  
LONGER OPERATE THEIR PATIO.
HOWEVER THERE ARE BUSINESSES
20:35:20  
THAT ARE STILL OPERATING THEIR 
PATIOS TO THIS DAY AND
20:35:23  OUR 
SURVEY FOUND THAT AMONG THOSE 
BUSINESSES
20:35:26  THE VAST MAJORITY OF 
THEM OVER 90% WANT
20:35:29  TO KEEP THEIR 
PATIOS OPEN OR THE ANOTHER YEAR 
OR
20:35:32  LONGER.
20:35:36 
AND SO THIS REALLY INDICATED TO 
US THAT THERE WAS A NEED
20:35:39  TO 
PROVIDE GREATER LONG TERM 
CERTAINTY ABOUT WHAT REGULATION
20:35:42 S 
FOR PATIOS WOULD BE MOVING 
FORWARD FROM THE
20:35:45  PANDEMIC.
20:35:50 
I THINK WE'VE FOUND FROM THIS 
PROGRAM THAT
20:35:53  POP UP PATIOS ARE A 
GREAT ADDITION FOR THE COMMUNITY
20:35:56 
COMMUNITY, THEY NOT ONLY PROVIDE 
MORE BUSINESS
20:35:59  PACE
20:36:03  SPACE FOR BUSINESSES.
WE THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT
20:36:06  TO 
ENCOURAGE MORE AS WE CONTINUE 
THE RECOVERY
20:36:10  FROM COVID-19.
OUR EFFORTS TO THEN TRANSITION 
THE PROGRAM
20:36:13  TO ALLOW FOR THIS 
LONG TERM CERTAINTY AND LONG 
TERM
20:36:17  VIBRANCY HAVE REALLY 
FOCUSED ON
20:36:20  TWO GUIDING 
PRINCIPLES.
MOST IMPORTANTLY, WE WANT TO
20:36:23  
RETAIN THE KEY PROGRAM BENEFITS
20:36:26  
THAT ALLOWED THE PROGRAM TO 
REALLY BE OF ASSISTANCE TO 

20:36:29 BUSINESSES.
WE WANT TO BE
20:36:34  FACILITATIVE OF 
BUSINESSES AND SUCCESSFUL
20:36:38  TO 
CREATE PATIOS WITHOUT A TON OF 
BURDENSOME RED
20:36:41  TAPE.
WE REALLY NEED TO CONTINUE TO 
HELP OUR BUSINESSES
20:36:44  ON WHAT IS 
REALLY A LONG ROAD TO RECOVERY 
AFTER THE ECONOMIC
20:36:47  ISSUES THAT 
WERE CAUSED BY THE CODONE 
PANDEMIC AND FOR
20:36:50  MANY BUSINESSES 
THAT ARE STILL ONGOING
20:36:54 .
AT THE SAME TIME, IN ORDER TO 
STRENGTHEN THE PROGRAM AND
20:36:58  
PREPARE FOR LONG TERM 
OPERATIONS, WE
20:37:01  ALSO NEED TO 
RESOLVE ISSUES WITH
20:37:04  TEMPORARY 
CONSTRUCTION THAT MAY AFFECT THE 
SAFETY OF THESE
20:37:07  PATIOS LONG 
TERM.
20:37:13 
ARMED WITH THESE GUIDING 
PRINCIPLES BEE DECIDE
20:37:16  DECIDED TO GET 
STARTED
20:37:20  ON REGULATIONS THAT 
WOULD ALLOW FOR LONG TERM PATIOS
20:37:22 
PATIOS.
BECAUSE WE WANTED TO HELP THE 

20:37:26 COMMUNITY THE FIRST STEP WE TOOK 
WAS GO BACK TO BUSINESS HE
20:37:28  AND 
GET THEIR INPUT ON POTENTIAL 
REGULATIONS.

20:37:31 SO WE DISTRIBUTED A SURVEY TO 
BUSINESSES THAT HAD OBTAINED
20:37:35  POP 
UP PATIO PERMITS.
THE SURVEY WAS DISTRIBUTED IN
20:37:38  
NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER OF 2021 
AND
20:37:41  WE RECEIVED 21 RESPONSES.
AMONG THE MOST IMPORTANT 
QUESTIONS THAT
20:37:44  WE ASKED ARE THE 
FIVE THAT ARE SHOWN ON THIS 
SLIDE
20:37:48 .
WHERE WE LISTED A PROPOSED 
REGULATION, AND THEN
20:37:51  ASKED 
RESPONDENTS TO QUANTIFY WHAT 
TYPE OF IMPACT THE
20:37:54  REGULATION 
WOULD HAVE ON THEIR BUSINESSES.
SO YOU
20:37:57  CAN SEE THE RESULTS OF 
THE SURVEY ON THIS SLIDE
20:38:01 , THEY 
ARE LISTED IN THE ORDER OF LEAST
20:38:04  
SUBSTANTIAL IMPACTS, WHICH ARE 
SHOWN ON THE LEFT, TO
20:38:07  THE 
REGULATIONS THAT WOULD HAVE THE 
MOST
20:38:11  SUBSTANTIAL IMPACTS, SHOWN 
ON THE RIGHT-HAND SIDE OF THE 
SLIDE
20:38:14 .

20:38:20 WITH THAT SURVEY DATA IN HAND WE 
GOT TOGETHER TO
20:38:23  PUT TOGETHER 
SOME INITIAL CHANGES TO 
REGULATIONS AND WE HELD
20:38:27  TWO 
SEPARATE WEBINAR EVENTS IN EARLY 
FEBRUARY
20:38:30  IN ORDER TO PRESENT 
THOSE INITIAL IDEAS TO 
BUSINESSES.

20:38:33 THE WEBINARS WERE ADVERTISED TO 
THE EXISTING
20:38:36  POP UP PATIO 
BUSINESSES THROUGH AN E-MAIL 
LIST AND ALSO
20:38:39  TO THE BROADER 
BUSINESS COMMUNITY THROUGH THE 
CITY'S
20:38:42  SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNTS.
WE ALSO HAD STAFF FROM OUR 
ECONOMIC
20:38:46  DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT 
CALL INDIVIDUAL BUSINESSES THAT 
WE THOUGHT MAY
20:38:50  BE PARTICULARLY 
IMPACTED BY THE POTENTIAL 
REGULATIONS IN ORDER TO ENSURE
20:38:53  
THAT THEY HEARD ABOUT THE 
WEBINARS FIRSTHAND
20:38:57 .
SO A TOTAL OF TEN ATTENDEES
20:39:00  
JOINED THE WEBINAR AND
20:39:03  P PRESENTED
20:39:07  
LARGELY POSITIVE RESULTS
20:39:10 , THE
20:39:13  
INFORMATION HERE IS CONSISTENT 
GENERALLY WITH AWAY
20:39:16  WE DISCUSSED 
IN THE WEBINARS.
SO THAT BRINGS
20:39:19  US TO A 
DISCUSSION OF THE PROPOSED 
ORDINANCE.

20:39:22 THE ORDINANCE REFLECTS THE INPUT 
WE GOT FROM BUSINESSES 
THROUGHOUT
20:39:26  THIS PROCESS AS WELL 
AS OUR EXPERIENCE AS
20:39:29  STAFF 
RUNNING THE PROGRAM AND SEEING 
THE IMPACTS THAT
20:39:32  THESE PATIOS 
ARE HAVING ON THE COMMUNITY.
THE FULL TEXT
20:39:39  OF THE ORDINANCE 
IS FOUND.IN EXHIBIT A BUT I 
WANTED TO
20:39:42  FOCUS ON A FEW 
SIGNIFICANT REGULATIONS IN THE 
ORDINANCE
20:39:46  WHICH ARE IMPORTANT 
FOR COMMISSIONER HE TO LOOK AT 
AND UNDERSTAND
20:39:49 .
THIS SLIDE PROVIDES AN OVERVIEW
20:39:52  
OF THESE THREE AREAS AND THEE 
ARE REALLY THE LARGE
20:39:55 EST PROPOSED 
CHANGES TO THE CURRENT POP UP 
PATIO REGULATIONS
20:39:58 .
WE FEEL THAT THESE
20:40:01  REGULATIONS 
ENHANCE PATIO SAFETY AND 
ESTHETICS
20:40:05  WHILE NOT DRASTICALLY 
EXPANDING THE LIST OF 
REQUIREMENTS
20:40:08  FOR BUSINESSES.
20:40:13 
A FULL COMPARISON OF THE 
PROPOSED ORDINANCE AND THE 

20:40:16 CURRENT POP UP PATIO PROGRAM IS 
CRUD IN YOUR PACKET
20:40:19  TONIGHT AS 
INFORMATIONAL ITEM 1.
YOU'LL SEE THESE
20:40:22  ITEMS CALLED 
OUT IN RED AS THE BIG 
DIFFERENCES THAT
20:40:25  BUSINESSES CAN 
EXPECT UNDER THE PROPOSED 
ORDINANCE.

20:40:28 AND I'LL TAKE ANOTHER FEW 
MINUTES TO GO THROUGH EACH
20:40:31  
PROPOSED CHANGE INDIVIDUALLY.
20:40:39 
FIRST REWE RETAIN THE QUICK AND
20:40:41  
SIMPLE PROCESS FROM THE POP UP 
PATIO PROGRAM.

20:40:44 SO THE OUTDOOR COMMERCIAL PATIO 
ORDINANCE
20:40:47  WOULD ESTABLISH A 
STRAIGHTFORWARD MINISTERIAL 
PROCESS
20:40:50  FOR ANY
20:40:55  BUSINESS THAT IS 
CONSIDERED BY RIGHT IN THEIR 
DISTRICT.
20:40:58 
THAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED MOST OF 
THEIR BUSINESSES THAT HAVE 

20:41:02 RETAINED THEIR BUSINESSES IN POP 
UP PATIO PROGRAM
20:41:05 , RESTAURANTS, 
CAFES, THESE BUSINESS
20:41:08 ES WOULD BE 
REQUIRED
20:41:13  TO PROVIDE A 
APPLICATION,
20:41:16  REVIEWED AND 
QUICKLY APPROVED BY CITY STAFF
20:41:20 .
20:41:23 
HOWEVER FOR BUSINESSES THAT 
TYPICALLY
20:41:27  REQUIRE A LITTLE MORE 
OVERSIGHT
20:41:30 , BUSINESSES LIKE BARS 
OR DAY CARES THAT
20:41:33  MIGHT HAVE 
OFFSITE
20:41:36  NOISE IMPACTS, THESE 
BUSINESSES ARE TYPICALLY 
PERMITTED WITH
20:41:39  A USE PERMIT AND 
UNDER THE PROPOSED ORDINANCE, 
ADDING AND
20:41:42  OUTDOOR PATIO TO 
THESE BUSINESSES WOULD REQUIRE A
20:41:45  
USE PERMIT AMENDMENT.
THIS WOULD MAKE SURE THAT THE
20:41:48  
CITY HAD MORE OVERSIGHT OVER 
THINGS LIKE HOURS OF
20:41:52  OPERATION, 
NOISE, AND DESIGN
20:41:55 , FOR THESE 
MORE SENSITIVE USES AND WOULD 
ALSO ALLOW US
20:41:58  TO ENSURE THAT 
BUSINESSES ARE FOLLOWING CORRECT 
LICENSE
20:42:01 ING REQUIREMENTS FOR PATIO 
OUTDOOR AREAS THROUGH
20:42:05  STATE 
AGENCIES AND OTHER
20:42:09  NONCITY 
ENTITIES.
SECOND
20:42:12 , POP UP PATIOS ARE 
CONSIDERED TEMPORARY USE
20:42:15 S THAT 
ARE CURRENTLY EXEMPT FROM MANY 
BUILDING
20:42:19  AND FIRE
20:42:22  COI
20:42:25  CODE 
REQUIREMENTS.
I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THE 

20:42:29 CITY DOESN'T HAVE ANY 
FLEXIBILITY, THE BUILDING AND 
TIRE
20:42:32  CODES MUST BE IMPLEMENTED 
UNDER ANY PROGRAM THAT MAKES 
THESE
20:42:35  USES PERMANENT.
BECAUSE PATIOS WOULD BE
20:42:38  
PERMITTED ON THE SITE LONG TERM 
WE HAVE TO FOLLOW THEN THE 

20:42:41 REGULATIONS FOR PERMANENT PATIOS 
WITHIN THE BUILDING AND
20:42:45  FIRE 
CODES AND THIS WOULD REALLY HAVE 
THREE MAIN AREAS OF IMPACT
20:42:49 .
FIRST THE PATIOS WOULD BE 
REQUIRED
20:42:52  TO PROVIDE AN 
ACCESSIBLE PATHWAY ENTRANCE SUCH 
AS
20:42:55  A CURB RAMP OR A FLUSH CURB
20:42:58  
IN ORDER TO ENSURE THE 
ACCESSIBILITY OF THE PATIO.

20:43:02 SECOND, IN ORDER TO AVOID
20:43:06  THE 
COMPLEX REQUIREMENTS THAT COME 
WITH BEING
20:43:09  CONSIDERED AN 
ASSEMBLY OCCUPANCY, PATIOS WOULD 
NEED
20:43:13  TO BE UNDER 750 SQUARE FEET 
IN AREA
20:43:16 .
THIRD, PATIOS WOULD NEED TO 
UPGRADE
20:43:19  AND SECURE TENTS, 
ELECTRICAL SENTENCES
20:43:22  EXTENSION
20:43:26 S AND IN 
ORDER TO COMPLY WITH BUILDING 
CODE
20:43:29  REQUIREMENTS FOR THOSE 
TYPES OF BUILDING STRUCTURES AND 
USES.
20:43:32 
FINALLY, THE THIRD PROPOSED 
CHANGE FOR THE
20:43:35  POP UP PATIO 
PROGRAM IS TO DEVELOP A LIST
20:43:39  OF 
APPROVED BARRIERS THAT IS 
MISSILE
20:43:42  
ADMINISTRATIVELY APPROVED
20:43:46  BY THE 
PUBLIC WORKS DEPARTMENT.
UNDER
20:43:49  THE CURRENT PROGRAM STAFF 
ALLOWS
20:43:52  SUBSTANTIAL FLEXIBILITY 
IN THE TYPE AND APPEARANCE OF 
BARRIERS.

20:43:55 BUSINESSES CAN USE TEMPORARY 
MATERIALS THAT WOULD
20:43:58  NOT 
TYPICALLY BE PERMITTED BY THE 
CITYWIDE DESIGN GUIDELINES
20:44:02 , 
INCLUDING THINGS LIKE CHAIN
20:44:05  
LINKS FENCING, ORANGE MOLDED 
PLASTIC
20:44:09  RAILS, CONCRETE POST
20:44:13 S 
STUCK INTO THEM AND LONG TERM 
THESE TYPES OF
20:44:16  MATERIALS JUST 
AREN'T DURABLE AND JUST AREN'T 
SAFE
20:44:19 .
SO STAFF ARE PROPOSING THAT THE 
PERMITTED BARRIERS
20:44:22  HAVE A HIGHER 
QUALITY APPEARANCE AND MORE 
DURABILITY
20:44:26  SO.
EXAMPLES WOULD BE THINGS LIKE 
METAL FENCING
20:44:30 , DECORATIVE 
PLANTERS, DECORATIVE
20:44:33  K RAILS 
WOODEN PALLETS AND THESE 
BARRIERS
20:44:36  WOULD BE MORE PREPARED 
FOR THE TYPES OF PERMANENT 
OPERATIONS
20:44:39  THAT WOULD BE 
PERMITTED THROUGH OUTDOOR 
COMMERCIAL PATIO ORDINANCE
20:44:42  AND 
THEREFORE THEY WOULD HELP 
IMPROVE BOTH THE SAFETY AND
20:44:45  THE 
ESTHETICS OF THESE PATIOS LONGER 
TERM.

20:44:56 SO THAT WRAPS UP MISOVERVIEW, 
AND WHILE
20:44:59  THIS IS OUTSIDE THE 
SCOPE OF PLANNING COMMISSION'S 
REVIEW TONIGHT I
20:45:02  WANTED TO SPEND 
A MINUTE DISCUSSING IT HERE 
BECAUSE
20:45:06  IT DOES TIE INTO HOW WE 
ARE PROPOSING TO
20:45:09  SUPPORT 
BUSINESSES DURING THIS PROCESS.
WHEN THIS MATTER GOES
20:45:12  TO CITY 
COUNCIL THEY WILL CONSIDER 
ADOPTING A
20:45:15  ONE TIME $500 FEE FOR
20:45:19  
NO RENEWAL FOR THE OUTDOOR
20:45:22  
PERMIT PATIO APPLICATIONS.
THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH OUR 

20:45:25 CURRENT SIDEWALK DINING 
ORDINANCE FEE WHICH THIS 
ORDINANCE WOULD BE REPLACING.
20:45:28 
HOWEVER, IN ORDER TO ASSIST 
BUSINESSES AND FACILITATE
20:45:33  THE 
CONTINUATION OF THE EXISTING 
PATIOS AND
20:45:37  THE POP UP PATIO 
PROGRAM STAFF ARE PROPOSING
20:45:41  TO 
REIMBURSE THE BAT YOA FEES FOR 
THOSE BUSINESSES
20:45:46  THAT APPLY 
PRIOR TO DECEMBER
20:45:49  31st, 2022.
SO POP UPPER PATIO BUSINESSES 
WOULD HAVE
20:45:52  FROM THE CITY COUNCIL 
ADOPTION DATE WHICH WE'RE 
EXPECTING WOULD
20:45:55  HAPPEN MOST 
LIKELY IN MAY WITH THE ORDINANCE 
BECOMING
20:45:58  EFFECTIVE IN JUNE TO 
THEN APPLY FOR A
20:46:02  LONG TERM 
APPROVAL UNDER THAT ORDINANCE
20:46:05  
BEFORE DECEMBER 31st, 2022
20:46:08 , 
BEFORE PATIOS WOULD NEED TO 
CEASE OPERATIONS
20:46:13 .
20:46:22 
THIS INCLUDES MY PRESENTATION.
I'M NOT AVAILABLE FOR ANY
20:46:25  
QUESTIONS THAT THE PLANNING 
COMMISSION MIGHT HAVE FOR STAFF 

20:46:28 ON THIS ITEM.
THANK YOU.
20:46:51 


20:46:57 
>> Commissioner Daulton:   
COMMISSIONER STECKLER.
20:47:00 
>> Commissioner Steckler:   
THANK YOU CHAIR.

20:47:03 FOR ANY BUSINESS THAT WOULD 
FACILITATE GETTING
20:47:06  A POP, I'M 
TRYING
20:47:10  TO UNDERSTAND WHY MISSION 
PIZZA HAS A
20:47:13  BAN, IF THEY WENT 
OUTSIDE FOR THE BAN,
20:47:16  WOULD THAT 
BE PERMITTED OR IS THAT A WHOLE 
SEPARATE ISSUE
20:47:19 ?
>> THAT IS A GREAT QUESTION.
THE CITY HAS
20:47:22  PREEXISTING NOISE 
ORDINANCES, WE HAVE ONE SECTION 
OR CODE ABOUT
20:47:25  THE RIGHT TO URBAN 
CORE OPERATIONS, WHICH
20:47:28  GOVERNS 
YOU KNOW THOSE TYPES OF 
SOMETIMES NOISY
20:47:32  OPERATIONS 
WITHIN OUR MORE URBAN AREAS OF 
THE CITY,
20:47:35  AND WE HAVE SEPARATELY 
NOISE REGULATIONS THAT GOVERN IT 
IN
20:47:38  OTHER AREAS OF THE CITY THAT 
MIGHT BE COMMERCIAL
20:47:41  SHOPPING 
CENTERS, MORE DISTRIBUTED AND AS
20:47:44  
PART OF THE ACTUAL CHANGES 
OPPORTUNITY POP UP PATIO PROGRAM
20:47:47  
TO THIS NEW ORDINANCE BUSINESSES 
WOULD JUST BE SUBJECT
20:47:51  TO THOSE 
PREEXISTING NOISE REGULATIONS.
SO
20:47:54  WE WOULDN'T BE CHANGING ANY 
NOISE REGULATIONS AT ALL UNDER 
THIS
20:47:58  PROGRAM.
AND UNDER THOSE
20:48:01  CURRENT 
REGULATIONS THERE ARE DECIBEL
20:48:04  
LEVELS THAT BUSINESSES NEED TO
20:48:07  
DEPLOY DURING THE HOUR OF THE 
DAY.
20:48:11 
GENERALITIES, WOULD NOT BE 
TYPICALLY PERMITTED
20:48:14  BECAUSE THE 
NOISE MIGHT BE TOO LOUD BUT 
SOMETHING THAT IS
20:48:17  EITHER 
ACOUSTIC OR A LOWER DECIBEL
20:48:20  
LEVEL MAY BE PERMITTED.
IT WOULD BE JUST
20:48:23  SUBJECT 
ESSENTIALLY TO THE CURRENT CITY 
STANDARDS FOR THOSE TYPES OF
20:48:26  
USES THAT WE HAVE ALREADY SET IN 
PLACE.

20:48:29 >> Commissioner Steckler:   
OKAY.
SECOND QUESTION I HAVE
20:48:33 , THE 
STAFF IS GOING TO APPROVE
20:48:36  THE 
TYPE OF BARRIERS THAT ARE PUT UP
20:48:39 
UP?
MY CONCERN WOULD BE, THAT 

20:48:42 SOMEBODY PUTS UP A MORE 
PERMANENT TYPE OF BARRIER
20:48:45  YOU 
KNOW LIKE CEMENT IT TO THE CURB
20:48:48  
LINE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
AND THEN, YOU KNOW, BRICK
20:48:51  AND 
WE'D HAVE TO TEAR IT DOWN OR 
WHATEVER.

20:48:54 SO STAFF WILL APPROVE ALL THE
20:48:57  
OUTDOOR CONFIGURATION
20:49:01  AND SPECS 
OF WHAT'S GOING TO GO IN THERE?
20:49:03 
>> THAT IS CORRECT.
SO THERE ARE KIND OF TWO STEPS 

20:49:06 IN THE PERMITTING PROCESS.
THE FIRST STEP WILL BE WHEN 
STAFF LOOK
20:49:09  AT EVERYTHING ON 
PAPER.
AND APPROVE
20:49:13  A CERTAIN 
CONSTRUCTION DESIGN.
AND AS PART OF THAT REVIEW
20:49:16  
PROCESS STAFF WILL NOT PERMIT 
ANYTHING THAT IS PERMANENTLY
20:49:19  
ATTACHED OR AFFIXED TO A PUBLIC 
RIGHT-OF-WAY
20:49:22  LIKE A CITY 
SIDEWALK, OR A YOU
20:49:25  KNOW CITY 
STREET.
THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT WE'RE 

20:49:28 ALLOWING UNDER THIS ORDINANCE.
IT IS SPECIFICALLY PROHIBIT
20:49:31 ED 
ACTUALLY IN THE TEXT OF THE 
ORDINANCE.

20:49:35 ON PRIVATE PROPERTY WE ARE MORE 
FLEXIBLE, BECAUSE IT IS THEIR
20:49:38  
PRIVATE PROPERTY SO WE DO HAVE 
THE POSSIBILITY TO
20:49:41  APPROVE 
PATIOS THAT DO HAVE PERMANENT 
ATTACHMENTS ON
20:49:45  PRIVATE AREAS OF 
THE CITY BUT THEY WOULD 
OBVIOUSLY HAVE TO
20:49:48  REMEDIATE THAT 
AFTER THE PATIOS WERE TAKEN OUT.
WITH
20:49:51  REGARDS TO THE NEXT STEP IN 
THE PROCESS THAT WOULD BE THE 
ACTUAL
20:49:54  CITY INSPECTION, RIGHT?
SO AFTER THE BUSINESS HAS A
20:49:58  
STAMPED APPROVAL FOR THE PATIO, 
ONE OF OUR
20:50:01  BUILDING INSPECTORS 
WOULD GO OUT TO MAKE SURE THAT 
IT IS CONSTRUCTED
20:50:04  IN THE WAY 
THAT IT IS SPECIFIED IN THE 
CONSTRUCTION DOCUMENTS.

20:50:07 AND SO THAT WOULD BE
20:50:10  OUR -- 
ESSENTIALLY OUR FIRST CHECK TO 
BE
20:50:13  SURE THAT IT'S CONSTRUCTED 
PER THE REQUIREMENTS TO NOT 
PERMANENT
20:50:17 LY AFFIX ANYTHING.
BUSINESS
20:50:20 ES NEED TO SIGN A 
SEPARATE
20:50:23 , I'M NOT SAYING IT'S A 
LAUNDRY LIST BUT A
20:50:27  LONG SET OF 
ITEMS,
20:50:30  LIABILITY CONSIDERATION 
FOR THE CITY AND SO THAT 
DOCUMENT DOES STATE THAT THEY
20:50:33  
CAN'T CHANGE THE BARRIER 
CONFIGURATION FROM WHAT IS 

20:50:37 APPROVED.
>> Commissioner Steckler:   AND 
MY LAST QUESTION, I KNOW I'M 

20:50:40 BEING KIND OF
20:50:43  PISSED HERE BUT IF 
THEY PUT IT UP IN THE STREET
20:50:46 , 
THE
20:50:50  AFGHAN RESTAURANT IN 9/11
20:50:54  IN 
CENTERVILLE
20:50:57 , TWO LANES 
NORTHBOUND, TWO LANES SOUTHBOUND
20:51:01 
SOUTHBOUND, ARE WE GOING TO BE 
SURE THAT THE
20:51:05  BICYCLISTS AND 
PEDESTRIANS WILL BE ABLE
20:51:08  TO 
TRAVERSE THOSE AREAS SAFELY?
20:51:12 
>> AS PART OF A
20:51:16  PUBLIC WORKS 
SPONSORED PROGRAM
20:51:19 , LARGER CITY 
STRATEGY AROUND
20:51:22  TRAFFIC MODES 
AROUND FREMONT BOULEVARD.
SO
20:51:25  TYPICAL PATIOS WITH IT NOT BE 
ABLE TO CHANGE
20:51:29  STREET GEE TRIES, 
THAT IS A VERY UNIQUE CASE.
WHAT
20:51:32  WE WILL BE DOING IS
20:51:35  
ENSURING THAT THE PATIO IS
20:51:38  
LOCATED OUTSIDE THE PEDESTRIAN
20:51:42  
OR BICYCLE AREA.
WE WILL
20:51:45  ENSURE THAT BICYCLE 
TRAVEL CAR TRAVEL BUS
20:51:48  TRAVEL CAN 
CONTINUE UNINHIBITED
20:51:53 .
20:51:56 
>> Planner Pullen:   COURTNEY, 
TO COMMISSIONER STECKLER'S FIRST 

20:51:59 QUESTION, CAN YOU COMMENT ON THE 
PORTION OF THE ORDINANCE THAT 
TALKS ABOUT
20:52:03  IN ADDITION TO THE 
NOISE ISSUE YOU MENTIONED THERE 
IS ALSO YOU KNOW
20:52:06  SOME BUSINESSES 
THAT HAVE USE PERMITS AND HOW 
THE ORDINANCE DEALS WITH
20:52:09  THAT 
FOR EXISTING BUSINESSES
20:52:12 ?
20:52:18 
>> I'M NOT SURE I UNDERSTAND THE 
SPECIFIC QUESTION.
20:52:21 
CERTAIN BUSINESSES DO REGULATE 
NOISE AND HOURS
20:52:24  OF OPERATION.
WE SEE THIS WITH BARS AND OTHER 
LATE
20:52:28  NIGHT USES THAT MAY BE
20:52:31  
JAIFT RESIDENCES, AS PART OF THE 
USE WE'D LOOK
20:52:34  AT THEIR HOURS OF 
OPERATION, THEIR INTENDED TYPES
20:52:38  
OF OPERATION OUTDOORS,
20:52:41  
RESTRICTING MUSIC TO CERTAIN 
HOURS MORE
20:52:45  NOISE IMPACTS, JOEL 
I'M NOT SURE IF THAT'S WHAT 
YOU'RE
20:52:48  GETTING AT.
>> Planner Pullen:   YES JUST TO 
SAY --

20:52:51 >> SOME OF OUR MORE NOISY USES
20:52:54  
ARE CERTAINLY COVERED UNDER THE 
USE PERMIT.

20:52:57 >> Planner Pullen:   AND THOSE 
BUSINESSES THAT HAVE THOSE USE 
PERMITS TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY
20:53:01  
HAVE PATIOS, YOU KNOW, THE TYPE 
OF THINGS
20:53:04  THAT REQUIRE THE USE 
PERMITS, THE PATIO WOULD ALSO BE 
SUBJECT
20:53:07  TO THOSE USE PERMIT 
CONDITIONS IF THEY EXIST
20:53:11 .
>> THAT IS CORRECT, YES.
20:53:14 
>> Commissioner Daulton:   THANK 
YOU.

20:53:18 CHAIR RECOGNIZES COMMISSIONER 
ZHANG.

20:53:21 >> Commissioner Zhang:   THANK 
YOU CHAIR.
I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS.

20:53:24 NUMBER 1,
20:53:28  THE AUDIENCE ALLOWS
20:53:33  
YOUTH PUBLIC PARKING SPOT AS 
THEIR PATIO
20:53:36 .
CURRENTLY WHICH PERMITS, WHICH
20:53:40  
BUSINESS UTILIZING THIS
20:53:44  -- 
THIS-THEIR PARKING LOT
20:53:48 , AS
20:53:52  
THEIR, THE ONE COMMENT IN MY 
MIND IS THE NILES BUT
20:53:55  I NEVER 
SEE ANYONE USE THEIR FRONT PARK
20:53:58 
PARKING LOT.
>> YES,
20:54:01  SO REGARDING PATIOS THAT 
ARE IN ON-STREET PARK
20:54:04 ING SPACES.
THERE ARE THREE PERMITTED ONES 
AND
20:54:07  ONLY TWO OPERATING ONES OR 
ONES THAT WERE AT
20:54:10  LEAST 
OPERATING ONES, TO MY
20:54:13  POINT OF 
KNOWLEDGE.
THERE IS ONE NEAR JOE
20:54:16 'S CORNER 
IN NILES AND ONE THE CITY 
CONSTRUCTED
20:54:19  ON FREMONT 
BOULEVARD.
THE OR THE ONE IS
20:54:23  ONE THAT'S 
PROPOSED ON CAPITOL AVENUE AS
20:54:26  
PART OF RAW SF, THEY RECEIVED
20:54:29  A 
PERMIT FOR THEIR PATIO, THEY ARE 
A
20:54:33  RELATIVELY NEW BUSINESS AND 
HAVE NOT CONSTRUCTED IT
20:54:36  YET.
IN A CITY OF FREMONT, WHERE WE 
HAVE
20:54:39  CONSIDERABLY HIGH STREET 
SPEEDS WE HAVEN'T SEEN A LOT OF 
THESE
20:54:42  PATIOS CURRENTLY BUT OUR 
HOPE
20:54:45  OF PASSING THE ORDINANCE, 
WE SET UP A STREET
20:54:48  FRAMEWORK 
WHERE WE TRANSITION TO MORE 
URBANIZE
20:54:52 ED AREAS OF THE CITY WE 
HAVE A FRAMEWORK TO
20:54:55  ALLOW THESE 
USES AND DO SO TO ENCOURAGE THEM
20:54:59  
WITHIN AREAS IN WHICH THEY ARE 
MORE SUIT ANNAL AND
20:55:02  APPROPRIATE 
WHERE PEOPLE WANT TO BE OUTDOORS 
DINING ON A STREET
20:55:07 .
20:55:11 
>> Commissioner Zhang:   IF I 
READ CORRECTLY, THE ITEM DOESN'T
20:55:16  
SAY ANYTHING ABOUT ACCESSIBILITY 
PARKING SPACE, THAT MAY BE
20:55:19  OUT 
OF REGULATIONS --
>> THAT IS A GREAT QUESTION AND 

20:55:22 A GREAT POINT OF CLARIFICATION.
SO ACCESSIBILITY IS GOVERNED
20:55:25  BY 
CHAPTER 11B OF THE BUILDING CODE 
WHICH
20:55:28  YOU WILL SEE CALLED OUT IN 
THE ORDINANCE.
AND BECAUSE THE BUILDING
20:55:32  CODE 
CHANGES EVERY THREE YEARS, WE 
FELT IT WAS IMPORTANT TO
20:55:35  NOT 
ACTUALLY PUT THE TEXT
20:55:39  OF THE 
CURRENTLY BUILDING CODE IN THE 
CURRENT
20:55:42  ORDINANCE, BECAUSE THE 
WE MIGHT HAVE TO UPDATE IT IF 
THE
20:55:45  REGULATIONS CHANGED.
THERE IS REFERENCE TO THE
20:55:48  
ACCESSIBILITY PROVISIONS IN THE 
CURRENT BUILDING CODE WHICH WILL 

20:55:52 BE THE GOVERNING REGULATIONS FOR 
THE PAT GROSS.
AND
20:55:55  THIS ENSURES THAT WHEN THE 
BUILDING CODE CHANGES AND
20:55:59  
ACCESSIBILITY STANDARDS CHANGE 
WE WILL NOT NEED TO UPDATE THE
20:56:01  
ORDINANCE BUT IT IS CERTAINLY 
SOMETHING THAT PATIOS ARE 

20:56:04 SUBJECT TO.
>> Commissioner Zhang:   THANK 
YOU.

20:56:07 IF THESE PERMITS ARE ISSUED, 
THEY WILL BE
20:56:11  LIKE A PERMANENT 
PERMIT, AS LONG AS
20:56:14  THE -- UNTIL 
THE BUSINESS CEASE, CORRECT?
20:56:18 
>> CORRECT.
SO THE PERMIT DOES NOT HAVE
20:56:21  A 
PERIOD OF EXPIRATION.
HOWEVER,
20:56:24  THERE ARE IF YOU READ 
TOWARDS THE BOTTOM OF THE 
ORDINANCE,
20:56:28  PROCEDURES THROUGH 
WHICH THE CITY COULD MODIFY OR 
REVOKE THE
20:56:31  PERMIT IF THERE WERE 
ONGOING ISSUES WITH THE PATIO.
20:56:34 
BUT OTHERWISE IT WOULD BE A ONE 
TIME APPROVAL
20:56:37 .
>> Commissioner Zhang:   IS IT 
TRANSFERABLE IF
20:56:40  THE O
20:56:44  OWNER 
CHANGE?
>> NO,
20:56:47  IT IS NOT TRANSFERABLE.
BECAUSE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE
20:56:50  
THAT THE OWNER FOLLOW THOSE 
CONDITIONS OF APPROVAL,
20:56:53  WE WILL 
REQUEST THAT THE
20:56:57  NEW TENANT 
RECEIVE A NEW PERMIT FOR PATIO.
20:57:00 
>> Commissioner Zhang:   I'M NOT 
SAYING NEW BUSY
20:57:03 IES BUT A LOT OF 
CASES WHERE THEY BUY THEIR 
BUSINESS
20:57:06 .
>> IF THE OWNERSHIP OF THE 
BUSINESS CHANGES WE
20:57:09  WILL NOT 
NECESSITATE A CHANGE IN THE 
PATIO
20:57:13  PERMIT BUT WHAT MATTERS IS 
A CHANGE IN THE USE
20:57:16 , RESTAURANT.
SO LIKE IF YOU SELL TRANSFER
20:57:19  OF 
ONE BUSINESS SAME NAME SAME 
OPERATIONS THEN THAT WILL
20:57:22  NOT 
TRIGGER THE CHANGE.
BUTTER IF YOU CHANGE FROM LIKE 

20:57:25 ONE RESTAURANT TO ANOTHER THEN 
WE WILL TRIGGER THE CHANGE
20:57:30 .
>> Commissioner Zhang:   I SEE 
THAT
20:57:33 , THIS LADY HAS THIS RENEWAL 
COURSES
20:57:37  LIKE ONCE A YEAR.
ON WHAT BASIS DO
20:57:40  WE DON'T DO 
THAT?
>> SO OTHER CITIES
20:57:43  AND THEIR 
ORDINANCES DO ESTABLISH A 
RENEWAL PROCESS
20:57:46  BY WHICH 
BUSINESSES WOULD NEED TO 
ESSENTIALLY REAPPLY EVERY
20:57:50  YEAR 
IN ORDER TO, YOU KNOW, KIND OF 
CONTINUE PATIO
20:57:53  OPERATIONS.
WE DECIDED NOT
20:57:56  TO INCORPORATE 
THAT REQUIREMENT FOR A FEW 
REASONS.
20:57:59 
THE FIRST IS THAT AFTER OUR KIND 
OF TEST RUN WITH THE POP
20:58:03  UPPER 
PATIO PROGRAM WE DIDN'T FEEL 
THAT IN
20:58:06  WAS ANY KIND OF NEW OR 
CHANGED INFORMATION THAT CAME 
OUT
20:58:09  AFTER THAT PERIOD OF TIME 
THAT WE WOULDN'T HAVE NOTICED AT 
THE
20:58:12  FIRST APPROVAL OF THE PATIO 
THAT WOULD
20:58:15  NECESSITATE THAT 
REREVIEW.
AND IT JUST CREATED
20:58:18  ANOTHER LURD 
L FOR BOTH BUSINESSES AND STAFF
20:58:21  
TO TRACK AND REUP THAT ONE YEAR 
OR TWO YEAR
20:58:24  APPROVAL DATE.
MOST OF THE CITIES THAT I'VE 
SEEN
20:58:28  WITH THE REAPPROVAL PROCESS 
ARE CITIES THAT HAVE A LOT
20:58:31  OF 
PATIOS ON PUBLIC PROPERTY.
AND
20:58:34  IF I HAD TO GUESS, THEY'RE 
GOING
20:58:38  TO BE EVALUATING THEIR 
SHARE OF PUBLIC PARKING THAT 
THOSE BUSINESSES
20:58:41  ARE TAKING UP 
AND POTENTIALLY RECONSIDERING
20:58:44  
HOW MUCH OF THAT PARKING IS 
BEING UTILIZED IN
20:58:47  AREAS THAT ARE 
TOWN CENTERS WHEN THOSE 
BUSINESSES REAPPLY.
20:58:50 
AND THAT'S SIMPLY NOT AN ISSUE 
WE HAVE IN FREMONT
20:58:54  BECAUSE AS I 
MENTIONED WE ONLY HAVE
20:58:57  TWO 
REALLY OPERATING ONES THAT WERE 
OPERATING IN THE
20:59:00  PUBLIC 
RIGHT-OF-WAY SO WE DON'T 
ANTICIPATE HAVING
20:59:03  THOSE PUBLIC 
PATIOS HAVING REALLY ANY IMPACT
20:59:07  
ON PUBLIC PARKING.
20:59:10 
>> Commissioner Zhang:   THIS IS 
THE FIRST TIME WE ISSUE TO THE
20:59:13  
AUDIENCE, COULD WE BE MORE 
CAUTIOUS, IF
20:59:17  BETTER TO DO MORE 
RESTRICTIVE IN THE
20:59:20  BEGINNING 
RELAX LATER, RATHER THAN
20:59:24  RELAX 
IT FIRST AND SIGH PROBLEMS YEARS 
LATER
20:59:27 , IT'S HARD TO FIX, I GUESS
20:59:30 
GUESS.
SOME OF THOSE GRANDFATHERED 

20:59:34 PERMITS WOULD JUST HANG THERE, 
HARD TO FIX, IS THAT CORRECT?
20:59:37 
HAS IT HAPPENED BEFORE?
>> I DEFINITELY UNDERSTAND
20:59:40  THE 
CONCERN RIGHT?
WE DON'T WANT TO CREATE A 

20:59:43 SITUATION WHERE WE'RE TRYING TO 
PEEL BACK REGULATIONS.
20:59:46 
I THINK AT THE END OF THE DAY, 
OUR ORDINANCE WAS
20:59:49  WRITTEN WITH 
THE IDEA OF REALLY ENCOURAGING
20:59:52  
THESE USES AS A TYPE OF VIBRANT 
USE THAT
20:59:56  WOULD BE TRANSFORMATIVE 
FOR A SHOPPING CENTER OR
20:59:59  A 
DOWNTOWN AREA AND, YOU KNOW, WE 
RECOGNIZE THAT BUSINESSES ARE
21:00:02  
STILL RECOVERING STRT CODONE 
PANDEMIC AND WE WANT
21:00:05  TO TRY AND 
HELP THEM OUT BY
21:00:08  CONTINUING TO 
FACILITATE THESE SPEAS IS
21:00:12 .
REDUCING THAT RED TAPE THAT 
WOULD BE ASSOCIATED WITH
21:00:15  A 
YEARLY CHECK IN OR OTHER 
RESTRICTIONS CREATING THOSE
21:00:18  
ONSTREET SPACES WE ARE REALLY 
TRYING TO FACILITATE
21:00:21  THEM 
UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE STILL 
ARE REALLY
21:00:24  SIGNIFICANT BARRIERS 
TO THEIR CREATION WITHOUT
21:00:28  US 
IMPOSING ADDITIONAL ONES AS WE 
HAVE SEEN THROUGH THE LACK
21:00:31  OF 
THEM IN THE CITY.
SO THAT WAS REALLY OUR INTENTION
21:00:34  
WITH THE ORDINANCE AND WHY WE 
CHOSE NOT TO IMPOSE
21:00:38  THOSE TYPES 
OF RESTRICTIONS ON ONSTREET
21:00:41  
PATIOS.

21:00:44 >> Commissioner Zhang:   ALL 
RIGHT.
21:00:50 
>> THIS IS CLIFFORD NGUYEN,
21:00:54  
ASSOCIATE PLANNING MANAGER.
IF I UNDERSTAND
21:00:57  COMMISSIONER 
ZHANG'S QUESTION CORRECTLY, IF 
IT'S
21:01:00  IN THE PUBLIC RIGHT-OF-WAY 
OR PUBLIC SPACE WE DO ISSUE
21:01:04  A 
PERMIT.
THE CITY LAST THE DISCRETION TO
21:01:08  
REVOKE OR ISSUE THAT PERMIT.
AS COURTNEY HAS MENTIONED
21:01:11  WITH 
OTHER CITIES THEY'RE TRYING TO 
BALANCE THE NEED OF
21:01:14  ONSTREET 
PARKING VERSUS ALLOWING FOR
21:01:17  SOME 
FLEXIBILITY FOR RESTAURANTS IN
21:01:21  
VERY URBANIZED AREAS IN CITIES
21:01:24  
LIKE SAN FRANCISCO, FOR EXAMPLE.
TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO HAVE AN 

21:01:27 OUTDOOR DINING SPACE.
BUT AT THE SAME TIME, THOSE 
CITIES
21:01:30  DO HAVE A RENEWAL FEE.
AND ACTUALLY, THERE IS
21:01:33  A MONTHLY 
FEE TO USE THE PUBLIC SPACE
21:01:36 .
SO IT'S NOT FOR FREE.
HERE,
21:01:39  WE ARE TRYING TO HELP OUR 
BUSINESSES OUT
21:01:43  IN THE BEST WAY 
WE CAN.
IT'S BEEN A LONG ROAD
21:01:46  TO 
RECOVERY.
WE'RE NOT DONE YET.
21:01:49 
AND AS COURTNEY HAS MENTIONED 
THERE'S
21:01:52  ONLY THREE ACTUALLY 
BUSINESSES TAKING ADVANTAGE OF 
USING THE
21:01:56  PUBLIC RIGHT-OF-WAY.
AND WHERE WE WILL SEE THAT WILL 
PROBABLY
21:01:59  BE IN NILES, WHERE WE 
HAVE
21:02:03  DIAL NAG PARKING, 
POTENTIALLY ON PACIFIC COMMONS,
21:02:06  
IF IT DOES BECOME A NEED, AND 
THEN ALONG
21:02:09  -- WITHIN OUR 
DOWNTOWN, CAPITOL AVENUE, AND 
THOSE
21:02:12  ARE THE AREAS WHERE I 
THINK THIS COULD OCCUR
21:02:15  WHERE 
THEY'RE CALLED PARK LETS
21:02:18  IN THE 
PUBLIC RIGHT-OF-WAY.
>> Commissioner Zhang:   I
21:02:21  HAVE 
QUITE A CONCERN HERE BECAUSE IF 
WE
21:02:25  ALLOW THIS BUSINESS USE OF 
THE PUBLIC SPACES
21:02:28  EVERYWHERE IN 
THE CITY THERE MIGHT BE 
SOMEWHERE THAT WE
21:02:33  UNFORESEEN 
THAT
21:02:36  WE DON'T USE SAFE STREET OR 
I MEAN
21:02:39  IN LIKE CENTRAL FREMONT 
SOMEWHERE.
21:02:43 
I -- BECAUSE YOU MENTION COUPLE 
OF
21:02:46  HOT SPOTS THAT YOU ANTICIPATE 
HAVE THE
21:02:50  PERMIT ALLOW PARKING, 
IS THERE A WAY WE CAN
21:02:53  LIMIT THAT 
THIS PUBLIC PARKING
21:02:57  SPACE, THIS 
PARKING LOT CAN BE ONLY ON
21:03:00  THAT 
STREET OR IN
21:03:03  CERTAINLY BLOCKS 
THAT ALLOW
21:03:08 ?
I MEAN --
>> YES,
21:03:11  THERE IS ALREADY SOME 
LIMITATIONS.
MAYBE COURTNEY
21:03:14  YOU CAN POINT OUT 
THE LIMITATIONS, THE
21:03:18  SIZE 
LIMITATIONS ET CETERA.
>> YES SO
21:03:23  --
>> Commissioner Zhang:   NOT 
REALLY SIZE BUT
21:03:26  LIKE PACIFIC 
COMMONS, CENTRAL FREMONT THAT
21:03:29  
AREA, LIMITED THOSE BUSINESSES 
CAN USE BASED
21:03:32  ON SOME RESEARCH, 
AND THEN ANY ADDITIONAL
21:03:36  STREET 
IS EITHER DISALLOWED OR
21:03:39  WE CAN 
MAKE
21:03:42  AMENDMENT TO OUR AUDIENCE 
IN THE FUTURE.

21:03:45 >> YES, SO JUST TO BE CLEAR I 
MEAN THE ONSTREET PATIOS
21:03:49  ARE 
ONLY SPECIFICALLY ALLOWED IN
21:03:52  
ONSTREET PARKING AREAS WHICH 
GENERALLY ARE LIMITED TO
21:03:56  OUR 
TOWN CENTER AREAS AND OUR 
DOWNTOWN AREA ALREADY JUST BY
21:03:59  
THE NATURE OF THE STREET FORM IN 
THOSE
21:04:02  COMMERCIAL AREAS.
SO
21:04:05  THERE WASN'T, DIDN'T SEEM TO 
BE
21:04:08  REALLY A NEED TO LIMIT THAT 
BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT THE 
CONDITIONS THAT
21:04:12  THOSE PATIOS 
COULD BE CREATED WERE ALREADY 
RESTRICTED
21:04:15  GEOGRAPHICALLY BASED 
ON THE AVAILABILITY OF ONSTREET 
PARKING
21:04:18  WITHIN BUSINESS 
DISTRICTS WHICH IS, YOU KNOW, 
GENERALLY LIMITED TO THAT
21:04:21  AREA.
WHAT I'D ALSO ADD IS
21:04:25  THAT, FOR, 
YOU KNOW,
21:04:28  THE KIND OF GENERAL 
RESTRICTIONS BY DISTRICT, ONE OF 
THE
21:04:31  THINGS THAT, YOU KNOW, IS 
DEFINITELY CENTRAL TO MIND IS 
LIKE
21:04:34  THE SPEED OF THE ROADWAY, 
RIGHT, AND MAKING SURE THAT
21:04:37  
WE'RE ONLY ALLOWING THESE ON 
ROADWAYS WHERE
21:04:41  THERE IS, YOU 
KNOW, A SUFFICIENT SPEED LIMIT 
AND BARRIER TYPE TO
21:04:43  PROTECT 
THEM.
AND RIGHT NOW OUR PUBLIC WORKS 

21:04:47 DEPARTMENT HAS ONLY IDENTIFIED 
AREAS THAT ARE SAFE UP TO
21:04:51  40 
MILES PER HOUR.
AND SO THAT DOES PROVIDE
21:04:55  WHILE 
IT'S NOT
21:04:58  COMPLICITLY LIMITED, 
BARRIERS THAT COULD
21:05:01  ALLOW THEM 
FASTER IN THE FUTURE, IT COULD 
BE A POSSIBILITY,
21:05:04  FOR NOW WE'RE 
RESTRICTING IT TO ESSENTIALLY
21:05:06  
THAT SPEED LIMIT BASED ON SAFETY 
FACTORS.

21:05:09 SO I WOULD THINK THAT THE 
COMBINATION OF BOTH THE
21:05:13  SPEED 
LIMIT, LIMITATIONS
21:05:16  OF THE BEAR 
IMRERS IN THE ORDINANCE AND THE 
ADMINISTRATIVE LIST
21:05:19  AND THE 
AVAILABILITY OF ONSTREET PARKING
21:05:22  
SUFFICIENTLY LIMITS THE AREAS IN 
WHICH THESE CAN BE CREATED
21:05:25  TO 
ESSENTIALLY THE AREAS WE'RE 
ALREADY TALKING ABOUT.

21:05:28 BUT THAT'S, YOU KNOW, A 
HYPOTHESES
21:05:32  
HYPOTHESIS AND NOT
21:05:35  SOMETHING 
I'VE KNOCKED OUT YET.
21:05:40 
>> COMMISSIONER ZHANG, IN AREAS 
LIKE NILES WHERE THE CITY
21:05:44  HAS 
AMPLE PARKING, THE CITY OWNS TWO 
LARGE PARK
21:05:47 ING LOTS IN NILES, 
THERE IS
21:05:51  NO PARKING ISSUE THAT 
WE KNOW MUCH, AND THE
21:05:54  URBAN 
DISTRICT THE THOUGHT IS TO GET 
PEOPLE OUT
21:05:57  OF THEIR CARS TO MAKE 
THE DOWNTOWN AREA MUCH MORE
21:06:00  
WALKABLE AND THERE ARE NO 
PARKING ISSUES IN DOWNTOWN.

21:06:03 WE UNDERSTAND YOUR CONCERN AND 
WE THINK THAT SOME BUSINESSES 
MAY
21:06:07  TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS.
CERTAINLY, IF
21:06:10  WE GO INTO ANOTHER 
SORT OF SHELTER
21:06:13  IN PLACE AND 
THEY CLOSEth DOOR DIKE
21:06:17  DINING WE 
MAY GET MORE OF THIS BUT
21:06:20  THIS IS 
SOMETHING THAT, FOR MOST 
BUSINESSES NOW THAT
21:06:23  INDOOR 
DINING IS ALLOWED IT IS AN 
OPTION FOR
21:06:26  THEM TO HAVE AN 
OUTDOOR DINING SPACE AS WELL.
21:06:29 
SO --
21:06:33 
>> Commissioner Zhang:   IT 
SEEMS LIKE YOU HAVE GOOD 

21:06:36 CANDIDATES AND ALSO MANY RULES 
THERE.
WHY DON'T WE JUST MAKE
21:06:39  IT CLEAR 
IN THE ORDINANCE
21:06:43  OR, SAY, 
OTHERWISE,
21:06:48  THOSE ABILITIES MAY 
CAUSE
21:06:52  PROBLEM FOR THE AUDIENCE
21:06:55 , 
RIGHT?
>> Planner Pullen:   I HEAR YOUR 

21:06:58 ISSUES, COMMISSIONER, WHEN I 
LOOK BACK TO SEE WE HAVE ONE
21:07:02  
OPERATING I THINK WE HAD THREE 
APPROVED AND ONE
21:07:05  WAS CURRENTLY 
OPERATING IN THE CITY OF THIS
21:07:08  
SIZE, THAT I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE 
THAT PROBLEM
21:07:11  WHERE THEY WERE -- 
WE WERE BUSTING AT THE SEAMS
21:07:16  
AND, YOU KNOW, TRYING TO
21:07:19  PEEL 
BACK.
BUT THE TONE HERE YOU CAN TELL 

21:07:22 FROM THE ORDINANCE AND THE WORK 
THAT COURTNEY ANSWER DONE IS
21:07:25  TO 
BE WELCOMING OF THE CONTINUING 
OF
21:07:29  THIS TREND.
AND SO I HESITATE TO
21:07:32  PUT 
BARRIERS.
BUT I UNDERSTAND MAYBE IT'S 

21:07:35 SOMETHING WE WOULD NEED TO 
REVISIT OVER TIME
21:07:39 .
21:07:51 
I SIGH THOSE WIND BLOCKERS 
PRETTY ORDER
21:07:54 LY FROM THIS 
AUDIENCE, IS THAT ALLOWED OR
21:07:57  --
>> YES, SO UNDER THE POP UP 
PATIO PROGRAM
21:08:02  TENTS WERE 
DEFINITELY ONE OF THE STRUCTURES 
THAT WERE YOU KNOW
21:08:05  KIND OF -- WE 
WERE ALLOWING OUT
21:08:10  OF NECESSITY 
BECAUSE WE UNDERSTOOD
21:08:13  THAT IN 
THE WINTER NO ONE WANTS TO EAT 
OUTSIDE ON A
21:08:16  RAINY DAY WITHOUT A 
CANOPY OVER THEIR HEAD SO WE
21:08:20  
WERE VERY FLEXIBLE IN TERMS OF 
THE TYPES OF TENTS WE
21:08:23  WERE 
PERMITTING.
UNDER THE ORDINANCE HOWEVER 

21:08:26 TENTS ALSO BECOME FURTHER 
RESTRICTED.
SO THERE ARE ADDITIONAL 

21:08:31 STANDARDS THAT TENTS UNDER THE 
ORDINANCE NEEDS TO MEET IN TERMS
21:08:34  
OF THEIR, YOU KNOW, KIND OF 
STRUCTURAL STABILITY AND DESIGN
21:08:37  
AS WELL AS THEIR FIRE 
CERTIFICATION AND
21:08:40  OTHER 
REQUIREMENTS
21:08:45  RELATED TO FIRE 
SAFETY.
AT THE END OF THE DAY WE
21:08:48  DECIDED 
TO NOT PUT ANY EXPLICIT 
REGULATIONS IN THE
21:08:51  ORDINANCE 
REGARDING THE DESIGN OF TENTS.
BECAUSE WE FELT THAT IT COULD
21:08:55  
VARY ACROSS DISTRICTS.
21:08:58 
BUT THE SHORT ANSWER TO YOUR 
QUESTION IS WITH THE REGULATION
21:09:01 S 
CONTAINED IN THE ORDINANCE THE 
TYPES OF TEMPORARY TENTS THAT 

21:09:05 PEOPLE HAVE NOW WILL JUST NOT BE 
PERMITTED UNDER THE
21:09:08  BUILDING AND 
FIRE REGULATIONS THAT WE HAVE SO 
THOSE TENTS WILL
21:09:11  NEED TO BE 
UPGRADED TO ANOTHER LONG
21:09:14  TERM 
PRODUCT IF THE ORDINANCE GOES 
INTO EFFECT AND PEOPLE CHOOSE
21:09:17  TO 
KEEP THEM OUTDOORS.

21:09:28 YORS IF
21:09:31 >> Commissioner Zhang:   IF I 
READ CORRECTLY
21:09:35  THOSE TENTS HAVE 
TO REMOVED AFTER BUSINESS HOURS?
21:09:38 
>> OUR BUSINESS REGULATIONS 
SPECIFY THAT FURNITURE OR OTHER
21:09:41  
YOU KNOW LIKE UMBRELLAS, OVER 
MOVABLE
21:09:45  TEMPORARY FURNISHINGS 
NEED TO BE REMOVED REALLY FOR 
THE BENEFIT
21:09:48  OF THE BUSINESSES TO 
ESSENTIALLY PREVENT PEOPLE FROM
21:09:51  
COMING IN AND STEALING THOSE 
ITEMS OR FROM CREATE
21:09:54 ING KIND OF 
SHELTER IN THOSE ITEMS.
THE BUSINESSES
21:09:58  HOWEVER CAN
21:10:01  LEAVE 
ANYTHING THAT'S TOO BIG TO BE 
MOVED.

21:10:04 SO THAT WOULD INCLUDE BARRIERS.
THAT WOULD INCLUDE STRUCTURES 
LIKE
21:10:07  TENTS AND ANYTHING THAT 
WOULD YOU KNOW CAUSE HARM TO
21:10:10  AN 
EMPLOYEE.
TO KIND OF MOVE
21:10:14  ON A DAILY 
BASIS.
>> Commissioner Zhang:  
21:10:17  I SEE.
HOPEFULLY, UNDERSTAND MY CONCERN
21:10:20  
IS, IF
21:10:23  BUSINESS -- IT'S NICE TO 
HAVE OTHER DINE
21:10:28 ING, BUT IF THE 
BUSINESS JUST BE
21:10:31  THOSE TENTS 
WITH THOSE WIND BLOCKERS ALMOST
21:10:35  
PERMANENT STRUCTURE LIKE WE SEE
21:10:38  
IN THE PANDEMIC THAT THERE IS, 
IT IS NOT GOING TO MAKE OUR CITY
21:10:41  
ANY BETTER, ANY MORE BEAUTIFUL
21:10:45 , 
ANY BETTER, THAT IS MY CONCERN.
YEAH,
21:10:49  THAT'S ALSO, FOR ME.
21:10:51 
THANK YOU.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   ANY 

21:10:54 OTHER QUESTIONS FROM 
COMMISSIONERS?

21:10:58 IN NOT, I WOULD LIKE TO GET A

21:11:01  AGENDA ITEM

GOES ON TO DISCUSSION ITEMS?
DO WE
21:12:53  HAVE ANY MISCELLANEOUS OR 
DISCUSSION ITEMS, JOEL
21:12:56 ?
>> Planner Pullen:   YES, SO I

SCANNELL PROJECT

BROUGHT THAT TO CITY COUNCIL AND
21:13:32  
GOT SOME GOOD FEEDBACK FROM THE
