Any questions, seeing none, I would I would ask Mark if you could address the wheelchair issue that was brought in the correspondence by the bicycle by Andreas

ANY QUESTIONS?

SEEING NONE, I WOULD -- I WOULD

 ASK MARK, IF YOU COULD ADDRESS THE WHEELCHAIR

[Captioner] 19:15:15
 ISSUE THAT WAS BROUGHT

[Captioner] 19:15:19
 IN THE CORRESPONDENCE BY THE BICYCLE

[Mark Hungerford (Senior Planner)] 19:15:19
Sure. So the the piece of correspondence provided to the city by bike Fremont, in addition to calling out a preferred bicycle design for the short short term racks in the common open space they did seek to have raised crosswalks across private street segments within the

[Captioner] 19:15:22
 BY ANDREAS.

[Captioner] 19:15:25

>> SURE.
THE PIECE OF CORRESPONDENCE PROVIDED

[Captioner] 19:15:29
 TO THE CITY BY BIKE FREMONT IN ADDITION TO CALLING

[Captioner] 19:15:32
 OUT A PREFERRED DESIGN FOR SHORT TERM RACKS AND THE COMMON OPEN

[Captioner] 19:15:35
 SPACE THEY DID SEEK TO HAVE RAISED CROSSWALKS

[Mark Hungerford (Senior Planner)] 19:15:37
development that would be in line with sidewalk elevations.

[Captioner] 19:15:39

ACROSS PRIVATE STREET SEGMENTS WITHIN THE DEVELOPMENT THAT

[Mark Hungerford (Senior Planner)] 19:15:41
I spoke to the engineering reviewer on the project, as well as the the building Nonstructural Reviewer on the project, to understand if what was designed was what met accessibility, design requirements, and they said that What was provided does meet the the accessibility requirements so not having a raise not

[Captioner] 19:15:42
 WOULD BE IN LINE WITH SIDEWALK ELEVATIONS.
I SPOKE

[Captioner] 19:15:45
 TO THE ENGINEERING REVIEWER ON THE PROJECT AS WELL AS

[Captioner] 19:15:50
 THE BUILDING NONSTRUCTURAL REVIEWER

[Captioner] 19:15:53
 ON THE PROJECT TO UNDERSTAND IF WHAT WAS DESIGNED

[Captioner] 19:15:57
 WAS -- WHAT MET ACCESSIBILITY DESIGN REQUIREMENTS
AND THEY SAID

[Captioner] 19:16:00
 THAT WHAT WAS PROVIDED DOES MEET

[Captioner] 19:16:03
 THE ACCESSIBILITY REQUIREMENTS.
SO

[Mark Hungerford (Senior Planner)] 19:16:04
having a raise crosswalk across these private 3 segments, and and also concerns, were raised potentially about emergency vehicle access, and whether or not the fire department and also Republic services.

[Captioner] 19:16:07
 NOT HAVING A RAISED CROSSWALK ACROSS THESE

[Captioner] 19:16:10
 PRIVATE STREET SEGMENTS.
AND ALSO,

[Captioner] 19:16:14
 CONCERNS WERE RAISED POTENTIALLY ABOUT

[Captioner] 19:16:18
 EMERGENCY VEHICLE ACCESS AND WHETHER OR NOT THE FIRE DEPARTMENT AND

[Mark Hungerford (Senior Planner)] 19:16:21
So the the waste collection vehicles, would be able to, or would sign off on a raised crosswalk at those locations because it could hinder or slow down access to, you know, to perform their services, so what was designed is is consistent with code and the idea

[Captioner] 19:16:23
 ALSO REPUBLIC SERVICES, SO THE WASTE COLLECTION VEHICLES, WOULD

[Captioner] 19:16:26
 BE ABLE TO OR WOULD
SIGN OFF ON A RAISED

[Captioner] 19:16:29
 CROSSWALK AT THOSE LOCATIONS BECAUSE IT COULD HINDER OR

[Captioner] 19:16:32
 SLOW DOWN ACCESS TO, YOU KNOW,

[Captioner] 19:16:36
 FOR THEM TO PERFORM THEIR SERVICES.
SO WHAT WAS DESIGNED IS

[Captioner] 19:16:39
 CONSISTENT WITH CODE.
AND THE

[Mark Hungerford (Senior Planner)] 19:16:39
of having a raise crosswalk at those locations may not be compliant with city regulations.

[Captioner] 19:16:42
 IDEA OF HAVING A RAISED CROSSWALK AT THOSE LOCATIONS

[Captioner] 19:16:45
 MAY NOT BE COMPLIANT WITH CITY

[Robert Daulton (PC Chairperson)] 19:16:47
Alright. Thank you. If there are no other questions from the Commissioners on this item any No.

[Andreas Kadavanich] 19:21:50
Thanks for letting me speak. Just a couple of comments.

[Captioner] 19:21:53
  KAVADAVNY WITH

[Andreas Kadavanich] 19:21:54
I appreciate the clarification on the bike parking.

[Andreas Kadavanich] 19:21:57
I do want to point out that we have objective standards for bike parking.

[Captioner] 19:21:57
 WEEK FREMONT, JUST A CUSTOM OF

[Captioner] 19:21:59
 COMMENTS.
I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS ON THE BIKE PARKING.


[Captioner] 19:22:02
I DO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT WE HAVE OBJECTIVE STANDARDS FOR

[Andreas Kadavanich] 19:22:03
there, well hidden in the bike. Master plan. Serve the Fremont municipal code, but they do exist, and the only way you can tell from an application whether you're meeting those requirements, is if they are properly indicated on the plans because the requirements basically boil down to having

[Captioner] 19:22:06
 BIKE PARKING, THEY ARE WELL

[Captioner] 19:22:09
 HIDDEN IN THE BIKE

[Captioner] 19:22:12
 MASTER PLAN INSTEAD OF THE FREMONT MUNICIPAL CODE BUT THEY

[Captioner] 19:22:16
 DO EXIST.
AND THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN TELL BY AN

[Captioner] 19:22:19
 APPLICATION WHETHER YOU'RE MEETING THOSE REQUIREMENTS IS IF THEY ARE PROPERLY

[Captioner] 19:22:22
 INDICATED ON THE PLANS.
BECAUSE THE REQUIREMENTS BASICALLY BOIL DOWN

[Andreas Kadavanich] 19:22:23
sufficient access space around each parking space and I've yet to see a plan set that actually calls out those dimensions.

[Captioner] 19:22:25
 TO HAVING SUFFICIENT ACCESS SPACE AROUND EACH PARK

[Captioner] 19:22:28
ING SPACE.
AND I HAVE YET TO SEE

[Captioner] 19:22:32
 A PLAN SET THAT ACTUALLY CALLS OUT

[Andreas Kadavanich] 19:22:33
I have to go in every time and measure it myself, to find out if a proposal is, in fact, compliant with the guidelines in our plans.

[Captioner] 19:22:35
 THOSE DIMENSIONS.
I HAVE TO GO IN EVERY TIME AND MEASURE

[Captioner] 19:22:39
 IT MYSELF TO FIND OUT IF A PROPOSAL

[Captioner] 19:22:42
 IS IN FACT COMPLIANT WITH THE

[Andreas Kadavanich] 19:22:42
So I'd I'd like to request that, you know, we update our instructions to applicants to make sure that those dimensional callouts are provided for all bike parking spaces, to make life easier for staff than people like myself that.

[Captioner] 19:22:45
 GUIDELINES IN OUR  PLANS.
SO I'D LIKE TO REQUEST

[Captioner] 19:22:48
 THAT, YOU KNOW, WE UPDATE OUR INSTRUCTIONS TO

[Captioner] 19:22:51
 APPLICANTS TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE DIMENSIONAL CALL-

[Captioner] 19:22:54
OUTS ARE PROVIDED FOR ALL BIKE PARKING SPACES TO MAKE

[Andreas Kadavanich] 19:22:57
Have a vested interest, in making sure these applications are done right with regard to the wheelchair raised crossing, and I understand that the current design needs all applicable codes I just wanted to point out.

[Captioner] 19:22:58
 LIFE EASIER FOR STAFF
AND PEOPLE LIKE MYSELF THAT HAVE

[Captioner] 19:23:01
 A VESTED INTEREST IN MAKING SURE THESE APPLICATIONS ARE DONE

[Captioner] 19:23:04
 RIGHT.
WITH REGARD TO THE

[Captioner] 19:23:07
 WHEELCHAIR RAISED CROSSING, AND I UNDERSTAND

[Captioner] 19:23:10
 THAT THE CURRENT DESIGN MEETS

[Captioner] 19:23:14
 ALL APPLICABLE CODES.
I JUST WANTED TO POINT OUT THAT

[Andreas Kadavanich] 19:23:15
That this is supposedly a pedestrian friendly development in a tod.

[Captioner] 19:23:19
 THIS IS SUPPOSED

[Andreas Kadavanich] 19:23:19
And yes, there are a lot of really nice pedestrian, friendly features in here.

[Captioner] 19:23:22
LY A PEDESTRIAN FRIENDLY DEVELOPMENT IN A TOD

[Andreas Kadavanich] 19:23:24
But at this particular location we default it to giving priority to cars.

[Captioner] 19:23:25
 AND YES THERE ARE A LOT

[Captioner] 19:23:28
 OF PEDESTRIAN FRIENDLY FEATURES IN HERE BUT IN THIS PARTICULAR

[Andreas Kadavanich] 19:23:29
We made it a street design that says, cars go straight and go flat.

[Captioner] 19:23:32
 LOCATION WE
DEFAULTED TO GIVING PRIORITY TO CARS.


[Captioner] 19:23:35
WE MADE IT A STREET DESIGN THAT SAYS CARS GO STRAIGHT

[Andreas Kadavanich] 19:23:36
Not no inconvenience. Wheelchair uses take a detour, Wheelchair users have to make a turn.

[Captioner] 19:23:38
, GO FLAT, NOT -- NO IN

[Captioner] 19:23:41
CONVENIENCE, WHEELCHAIR USERS TAKE A DETOUR

[Andreas Kadavanich] 19:23:42
They have to change elevation. They have to control across those bumpy, you know, top cones.

[Captioner] 19:23:45
.
WHEELCHAIR USERS HAVE TO MAKE A

[Captioner] 19:23:48
 TUSH, THEY HAVE TO CHANGE -- TURN

[Andreas Kadavanich] 19:23:51
So yeah, we're we're it's it's the default for most developments in Fremont.

[Captioner] 19:23:51
, THEY HAVE TO MAKE A CHANGE IN VACATION,

[Captioner] 19:23:55
 THEY HAVE TO CHANGE OVER THOSE BUMPY

[Captioner] 19:23:58
 CONES.
YES IT IS THE DEFAULT FOR MOST DEVELOPMENTS

[Captioner] 19:24:01
 IN FREMONT.
AND I JUST HOPE THAT WE CAN RAISE THE

[Captioner] 19:24:04
 BAR AND IF THERE ARE CONCERNS ABOUT EMERGENCY VEHICLE ACCESS AND

[Captioner] 19:24:07
 SERVICE VEHICLE ACCESS, LET'S CLEAR THOSE UP.

.
>> Commissioner Zhang:   I JUST WANT TO KNOW IS

[Captioner] 19:25:57
 THERE SOLAR PANEL REQUIRED LATER

[Captioner] 19:26:01
 THAN 2022, IF I RECALL CORRECTLY.
I'M

[Mark Hungerford (Senior Planner)] 19:26:03
yeah, So under the present building code rooftop solar upon build out is not required unless the title 24 energy Report.

[Captioner] 19:26:04
 NOT SEEING ANY  SPECIFICATIONS OF SOLAR 

[Captioner] 19:26:07
 CONNECTORS.
>> YES, SO UNDER IF PRESENT

[Captioner] 19:26:10
 BUILDING CODE ROOFTOP SOLAR UPON BUILD

[Captioner] 19:26:13
OUT IS NOT REQUIRED UNLESS THE TITLE 24 ENERGY

[Mark Hungerford (Senior Planner)] 19:26:13
That's performed at the building plan check level identifies that as necessary for energy needs The rooftop would have to be solar ready from a structural standpoint that may change, though with the new code cycle that goes into effect.

[Captioner] 19:26:16
 REPORT THAT'S PERFORMED AT THE BUILDING PLAN CHECK

[Captioner] 19:26:19
 LEVEL IDENTIFIES THAT AS NECESSARY
FOR ENERGY NEEDS.

[Captioner] 19:26:22

THE ROOFTOP WOULD HAVE TO BE SOLAR-READY FROM A

[Captioner] 19:26:26
 STRUCTURAL STANDPOINT.
THAT MAY CHANGE, THOUGH, WITH THE NEW

[Captioner] 19:26:29
 CODE CYCLE THAT GOES INTO EFFECT THE FIRST OF THE YEAR

[Captioner] 19:26:32
.


[Captioner] 19:26:36
>> Commissioner Zhang:   ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   YES,

[Robert Daulton (PC Chairperson)] 19:26:37
yeah, so, mark So on. On page 4 of the staff report.

[Captioner] 19:26:40
 SO MARK, SO ON PAGE 4

[Robert Daulton (PC Chairperson)] 19:26:40
You're talking about. General plan, conformance there, and you cite land use policy to point 1.7, 2, 1.7.

[Captioner] 19:26:43
 OF THE STAFF REPORT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT GENERAL

[Captioner] 19:26:47
 PLAN CONFORMS

[Robert Daulton (PC Chairperson)] 19:26:49
regarding the transit oriented city. Can Can you tell me what's the time that it takes to walk from this development to the bar station?

[Captioner] 19:26:50
 CONFORMANCE THERE, YOU SITE 2

[Captioner] 19:26:53
.1.7 REGARDING THE TRANSIT ORIENTED

[Captioner] 19:26:57
 CITY.
CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT'S THE TIME THAT

[Mark Hungerford (Senior Planner)] 19:27:00
So the that policy was put in for projects. General plan compliance, because it's it's close to the planned and funded future Irvington Bard Station.

[Captioner] 19:27:00
 IT TAKES TO WALK FROM THIS DEVELOPMENT TO THE BART STATION

[Captioner] 19:27:03
.
>> SO THAT POLICY WAS PUT IN

[Captioner] 19:27:07
 FOR PROJECTS GENERAL PLAN COMPLIANCE BECAUSE IT'S

[Captioner] 19:27:10
 CLOSE TO THE PLANNED AND FUNDED FUTURE

[Mark Hungerford (Senior Planner)] 19:27:11
It is a roughly about a 1,000 foot walk along city sidewalks to to the proposed station location. And so that's why that that policy was added as as a project conformance feature

[Captioner] 19:27:14
 IRVINGTON BART STATION.
IT IS A

[Captioner] 19:27:17
 ROUGHLY ABOUT A THOUSAND

[Captioner] 19:27:20
 FOOT WALK ALONG CITY SIDEWALKS TO THE PROPOSED STATION LOCATION

[Captioner] 19:27:24
 LOCATION.
AND SO THAT'S WHY THAT POLICY WAS ADD

[Robert Daulton (PC Chairperson)] 19:27:26
Okay, So can you tell me how double parking these townhouses that close to the their most robust transit options we have in the city of free month in any way reduces dependence on single passenger automobiles

[Captioner] 19:27:27
ED, AS A PROJECT CONFORMANCE FEATURE

[Captioner] 19:27:32
.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   OKAY SO CAN YOU TELL ME HOW DOUBLE PARKING

[Captioner] 19:27:35
 THESE TOWN HOUSES THAT CLOSE TO THE -- THEIR MOST

[Captioner] 19:27:39
 ROBUST TRANSIT OPTIONS WE HAVE IN THE CITY OF FREMONT IN

[Captioner] 19:27:42
 ANY WAY REDUCES
DEPENDENCE ON

[Mark Hungerford (Senior Planner)] 19:27:44
So this particular site, it is not subject to twod requirements, or the twod overlay zone requirements, because it is not designated as urban, residential

[Captioner] 19:27:46
 SINGLE PASSENGERS AUTOMOBILES?
>> SO THIS

[Captioner] 19:27:49
 PARTICULAR SITE IT IS NOT SUBJECT TO TOD REQUIREMENTS OR

[Captioner] 19:27:52
 THE TOD OVERLAY REQUIREMENTS BECAUSE IT IS NOT DESIGNATE

[Robert Daulton (PC Chairperson)] 19:27:54
It doesn't answer my question.

[Captioner] 19:27:55
ED AS URBAN RESIDENTIAL.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   THAT

[Mark Hungerford (Senior Planner)] 19:27:56
Yeah. Can you repeat your question again

[Robert Daulton (PC Chairperson)] 19:27:59
How it is double parking. These These townhouses reduced dependence on single passenger automobiles, as cited in land, use policy 207, that you used to justify the general and conformance so this development

[Captioner] 19:27:59
 DOESN'T ANSWER ANY QUESTION.
>> CAN YOU REPEAT

[Captioner] 19:28:02
 YOUR QUESTION AGAIN?
>> Commissioner Daulton:   HOW DOES DOUBLE PARKING

[Captioner] 19:28:06
 THESE TOWN HOUSES REDUCE

[Captioner] 19:28:09
 DEPENDENCE ON SINGLE PASSENGERS AUTOMOBILES

[Captioner] 19:28:13
 AS CITED IN LAND USE POLICY 217

[Mark Hungerford (Senior Planner)] 19:28:15
I I think that's more location based. So there, this site is within proximity of multimodal transit options, and though 2 car garages are being proposed, they there, are other options for mobility that may not be afforded in other areas and so that's why that that policy was

[Captioner] 19:28:16
 THAT YOU USE TO GENERAL PLAN CONFORMANCE OF

[Captioner] 19:28:19
 THIS
DEVELOPMENT?
>> I THINK THAT'S MORE LOCATION BASED

[Captioner] 19:28:22
.
SO THIS SITE IS

[Captioner] 19:28:26
 WITHIN PROXIMITY OF MULTIMODAL TRANSIT OPTION

[Captioner] 19:28:29
S AND

[Captioner] 19:28:32
 TWO OPTIONS ARE PROPOSED, THERE ARE

[Robert Daulton (PC Chairperson)] 19:28:33
Okay, All right, let's see. So is anyone else.

[Captioner] 19:28:36
 OTHER POLICIES, THAT'S WHY THAT POLICY WAS ADD

[Captioner] 19:28:38
ED.
>> Commissioner Daulton:   OKAY, ALL RIGHT.


[Captioner] 19:28:41
LET'S SEE, SO DOES ANYONE ELSE

[Robert Daulton (PC Chairperson)] 19:28:41
Have questions of staff on this item. I take it not so.

[Captioner] 19:28:44
 HAVE QUESTIONS OF STAFF ON THIS ITEM?
I TAKE

[Captioner] 19:41:51
>> Commissioner Yee:   WELL, YOU HAVE ALREADY ANNALSED THAT QUESTION

[Ben Yee (Commissioner)] 19:41:51
I was wondering if it was a tandem or not.

[Ben Yee (Commissioner)] 19:41:52
But Yeah, it looks like it's a just what made for one car

[Captioner] 19:41:55
 MY QUESTION ABOUT THAT SINGLE CAR GARAGE

[Ben Yee (Commissioner)] 19:41:57
Yeah, and then I also was one of the I had one of the questions earlier related to.

[Captioner] 19:41:58
.
LOOKS LIKE A TANDEM BUT LOOKS

[Captioner] 19:42:01
 LIKE IT'S MADE FOR ONE CAR.
>> THAT IS CORRECT.
>> Commissioner Yee:   AND

[Ben Yee (Commissioner)] 19:42:03
You know the the issue with looking at that grass fire that was out there when I was, you know, walking around that property, and saw that that happened back in August.

[Captioner] 19:42:04
 THEN I WAS ALSO -- I HAD ONE OF THE QUESTIONS EARLIER RELATED TO

[Captioner] 19:42:07
 THE ISSUE WITH LOOKING AT THAT GRASS FIRE

[Captioner] 19:42:10
 THAT WAS OUT THERE WHEN I WAS WALKING

[Captioner] 19:42:13
 AROUND THAT 
PROPERTY.
AND SAW THAT THAT HAPPENED BACK

[Ben Yee (Commissioner)] 19:42:14
30. First, Has there been any other fires on that site previous to the one on August 30?

[Captioner] 19:42:17
 IN AUGUST 31st, HAS THERE BEEN ANY OTHER

[Captioner] 19:42:20
 FIRES ON THAT SITE PREVIOUS TO THE ONE ON AUGUST

[] 19:42:24
the fire department only fire that they may

[Captioner] 19:42:24
 31st?
>> I -- WHEN YOU ASK THAT

[Captioner] 19:42:27
 QUESTION I CHECKED WITH THE FIRE DEPARTMENT.
THAT WAS

[Captioner] 19:42:30
 THE ONLY FIRE THAT THEY MENTIONED TO ME.

[] 19:42:32
The turned over to keep, so there isn't much in the way of fuel

[Captioner] 19:42:33

IT'S REGULARLY DISKED, THE SOIL IS

[Captioner] 19:42:36
 TURNED OVER TO KEEP THE GRASS LOW.
SO THERE

[Captioner] 19:42:39
 ISN'T MUCH IN THE WAY OF FUELS ON THE SITE TO BURN.
SO IF

[Captioner] 19:42:42
 THERE WERE OTHER PREVIOUS FIRES, THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN

[Ben Yee (Commissioner)] 19:42:43
First.

[Robert Daulton (PC Chairperson)] 19:42:45

>> Commissioner Zhang:   WHEN I WALKED ON THE SITE,

[Captioner] 19:44:12
 THE FIRST PROPERTY BELONGS

[Yonggang Zhang (Commissioner)] 19:44:15
I see there's a construction that's I think, the base of Yes, yes, happening right now, under the the bank, over the construction is just right along the property line.

[Captioner] 19:44:16
 TO YUA

[Captioner] 19:44:19

THERE IS CONSTRUCTION THE BASE IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW AND THE

[Captioner] 19:44:29
 BACK OF THE CONSTRUCTION IS JUST RIGHT ALONG THE PROPERTY LINE

[Yonggang Zhang (Commissioner)] 19:44:29
Yes, almost no space to build them offense. I. Is this.

[Captioner] 19:44:32
.
IT'S ALMOST NO SPACE

[Captioner] 19:44:35
 TO BUILD A FENCE.

[Yonggang Zhang (Commissioner)] 19:44:37
Something should be worried about like

[Captioner] 19:44:38

IS THIS SOMETHING TO BE WORRIED ABOUT

[] 19:44:40
There, referring to from harp for a

[Captioner] 19:44:41
, LIKE --

[Captioner] 19:44:45

>> THERE -- SO THE PROPERTY YOU'RE REFERRING TO RECEIVED

[Captioner] 19:44:48
 APPROVAL FROM HARB FOR A

[] 19:44:50
It's part of the

[Captioner] 19:44:51
 SECOND HOME TO BE BUILT ON

[] 19:44:53
Homes, on yeah.

[Captioner] 19:44:54
 THE  PROPERTY, THE BRYANT STREET NEIGHBORHOOD

[Captioner] 19:44:57
 CONSERVATION DISTRICT WHICH DOES
ALLOW TWO HOMES ON SOME OF THE

[Captioner] 19:45:01
 LOTS.
THAT HAS RECEIVED ENTITLEMENTS BUT

[] 19:45:01
Other

[Captioner] 19:45:04
 IT HASN'T RECEIVED BUILDING PERMITS.
THEY MAY BE

[] 19:45:04
Do know that there's building permit at home, but I don't

[Captioner] 19:45:07
 DOING OTHER CONSTRUCTION THAT I HAVEN'T SEEN BUT I DO KNOW THEY ARE STILL

[Captioner] 19:45:10
 WORKING THROUGH THEIR BUILDING PERMITS FOR THE SECOND HOME.
BUT

[Captioner] 19:45:14
 I DON'T KNOW OF ANYTHING THEY -- THEY COULD BE DOING

[] 19:45:14
Utility work. I know it's a and your old home, doing some trenching or work going on there but affect anything, because it would be the same as if your neighbor

[Captioner] 19:45:17
 SOME UTILITY WORK.
I KNOW IT'S A 1

[Captioner] 19:45:20
10-YEAR-OLD HOME.
SO THEY MIGHT BE DOING SOME

[Captioner] 19:45:23
 TRENCHING OR SOMETHING.
I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH ANY WORK GOING ON THERE.


[Captioner] 19:45:26
BUT IT WON'T AFFECT ANYTHING BECAUSE THEY WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO CROSS

[Captioner] 19:45:29
 THE PROPERTY LINE.
IT WOULD BE THE SAME IF YOUR NEIGHBOR

[Captioner] 19:45:33
 WAS DOING CONSTRUCTION ON THEIR HOUSE, THEY OBVIOUSLY

[] 19:45:34
But yeah.

[Captioner] 19:45:37
 CAN'T CROSS PROPERTY LINES, THE

[] 19:45:38
The the new home and the seen home on

[Captioner] 19:45:41
 FENCE CAN BE BUILT ON THE PROPERTY LINES.
SO THERE WILL BE A

[Captioner] 19:45:44
 PRETTY DECENT GAP BETWEEN THE NEW HOME AND THE

[Captioner] 19:45:47
 EXISTING HOME ON THE ADJACENT PROPERTY AND THIS, THIS

[Yonggang Zhang (Commissioner)] 19:45:49
okay, I'm pretty sure the the the basis, foundation is ready.

[Captioner] 19:45:51
  PROPERTY.


[Captioner] 19:45:54
>> Commissioner Zhang:   OKAY, I'M PRETTY SURE THE BASE FOUNDATION

[Captioner] 19:45:57
 IS ALREADY THERE.
I'M -- BUT ANY

[] 19:45:58
I would have to check

[Robert Daulton (PC Chairperson)] 19:45:58
Hello!

[Captioner] 19:46:00
HOW.
>> I WOULD HAVE TO CHECK

[Captioner] 19:46:03
 THE PERMIT RECORDS TO SEE.
>> Commissioner Daulton:  

[Captioner] 19:46:06
 ALL RIGHT, COMMISSIONER BASRAI.
DO YOU HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION

[Jasmine Basrai (Commissioner)] 19:46:07
I I kind of wanna echo Commissioner Zang's point.

[Captioner] 19:46:11
?
>> Commissioner Basrai:   I KIND OF WANT TO

[Jasmine Basrai (Commissioner)] 19:46:12
I drove by today yesterday and there's like a foundation being built like a building foundation being built there.

[Captioner] 19:46:14
 ECHO COMMISSIONER ZHANG'S POINT.
I DROVE BY IT YESTERDAY.


[Captioner] 19:46:17
AND THERE'S LIKE A FOUNDATION BEING BUILT, LIKE

[Captioner] 19:46:21
 A BUILDING FOUNDATION BEING BUILT THERE.
AND THAT

[Jasmine Basrai (Commissioner)] 19:46:21
And that was my biggest concern. It looks like another property is going up separate to the house, and the unit that's there.

[Captioner] 19:46:24
 WAS MY BIGGEST CONCERN.
IT LOOKS LIKE ANOTHER PROPERTY IS

[Captioner] 19:46:27
 GOING UP.
SEPARATE TO THE

[Jasmine Basrai (Commissioner)] 19:46:28
It looks very much like a foundation that's going on.

[Captioner] 19:46:30
 HOUSE, THE UNIT THAT'S THERE.
IT LOOKS VERY

[Captioner] 19:46:33
 MUCH LIKE A FOUNDATION THAT'S GOING UP

[Jasmine Basrai (Commissioner)] 19:46:34
So just

[Jasmine Basrai (Commissioner)] 19:46:37
It's it's completely at the rear of the lot, but it's next to the existing property.

[Captioner] 19:46:37
.
SO --
>> SO AT THE REAR OF

[Captioner] 19:46:40
 THE LOT OF THE ADJACENT NEIGHBOR?

[Captioner] 19:46:43

>> Commissioner Basrai:   IT'S COMPLETELY AT THE REAR OF THE LOT BUT 

[Jasmine Basrai (Commissioner)] 19:46:44
So if you go there, you've got the empty lot, and there's no clear designation of where the lot ends.

[Captioner] 19:46:47
IT'S NEXT TO THE EXISTING PROPERTY.
SO IF YOU GO THERE, YOU'VE GOT

[Captioner] 19:46:50
 THE EMPTY LOT AND THERE'S NO CLEAR DESIGNATION OF

[Jasmine Basrai (Commissioner)] 19:46:51
But you see, like Commissioner Zhang said, a foundation going up like it doesn't look like and that, and you know an edu or an adjacent piece of property.

[Captioner] 19:46:53
 WHERE THE LOT ENDS.
BUT YOU SEE

[Captioner] 19:46:57
 LIKE COMMISSIONER ZHANG SAID, A FOUNDATION GOING UP.
LIKE IT DOESN'T LOOK

[Captioner] 19:47:02
 LIKE AN ADU

[Jasmine Basrai (Commissioner)] 19:47:04
It looks like a brand new unit going next to that. So that's kind of my concern right now.

[Captioner] 19:47:06
 OR AN ADJACENT PIECE OF  PROPERTY.
IT LOOKS LIKE A BRAND-NEW

[Captioner] 19:47:10
 UNIT GOING NEXT TO THAT.
SO THAT'S KIND OF

[] 19:47:12
There.

[Captioner] 19:47:13
 MY CONCERN RIGHT NOW.
IT'S LIKE WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S

[Captioner] 19:47:16
 GOING ON.
>> THERE IS -- SORRY.


[] 19:47:18
on that problem.

[Captioner] 19:47:20
THERE WILL BE A NEW HOME ON THAT PROPERTY.
IT'S AT THE

[] 19:47:22
Story home It's not

[Captioner] 19:47:23
 REAR OF THE SITE.
IT IS A NEW TWO-STORY HOME.


[Captioner] 19:47:26
IT'S NOT AN ADU.
THIS IS A NEIGHBORHOOD --

[Captioner] 19:47:29
 THE ADJACENT HOME IS FARTHER OF A NEIGHBORHOOD THAT DOES ALLOW

[] 19:47:30
Homes plans for that front of me right now that I

[Captioner] 19:47:33
 TWO SINGLE FAMILY HOMES.
UNFORTUNATELY

[Captioner] 19:47:36
, I DON'T HAVE THE PLANS FOR THAT IN FRONT OF ME RIGHT

[Captioner] 19:47:39
 NOW BUT I COULD CHECK, IF YOU GIVE ME --

[] 19:47:41
But to my knowledge they are still

[Captioner] 19:47:42
 I COULD CHECK AND COME BACK TO YOU WITH THE PERMIT RECORDS TO SEE

[Captioner] 19:47:45
 IF THEY RECEIVED ANY
APPROVALS FOR CONSTRUCTION.
TO

[Captioner] 19:47:49
 MY KNOWLEDGE BECAUSE IT IS ONE OF MY PROJECTS AS WELL, THEY ARE STILL

[] 19:47:49
Yeah.

[Captioner] 19:47:52
 WORKING THROUGH THEIR BUILDING PERMITS.
SO IF THEY

[Captioner] 19:47:55
 ARE DOING CONSTRUCTION AND IF THEY DO HAVE A PERMIT THAT COULD BE

[Captioner] 19:47:58
  TROUBLESOME BUT IT DOES NOT AFFECT THIS PROJECT THAT'S

[Captioner] 19:48:01
 BEFORE US TONIGHT IN ANY WAY.
IT IS A SEPARATE LEGAL LOT

[Captioner] 19:48:04
 AND IT WILL BE SEPARATE.
THEY CANNOT CROSS PROPERTY

[Captioner] 19:48:07
  LINES.
AND ANY FENCE THAT'S BEING BUILT WILL

[Captioner] 19:48:10
 BE BUILT ON THE PROPERTY LINE.
SO THERE

[Joel Pullen (Planning Commission Secretary)] 19:48:12
if I can just add to that if you don't mind that house, there is a portion of that a lot that extends toward this property, and a lot of times these vacant lots it's a little unclear over the years you know where that, line might be might not be well delineated but

[Captioner] 19:48:14
 SHOULD NOT BE A CONFLICT

[Captioner] 19:48:17
.
>> Planner Pullen:   IF I CAN JUST ADD TO THAT,

[Captioner] 19:48:20
 IF YOU DON'T MIND.
THAT HOUSE, THERE IS A PORTION OF THAT LOT

[Captioner] 19:48:23
 THAT EXTENDS TOWARDS THIS PROPERTY.
AND A LOT OF

[Captioner] 19:48:26
 TIMES THESE VACANT LOTS IT'S A LITTLE UN

[Joel Pullen (Planning Commission Secretary)] 19:48:29
I would say it, it would be extremely unlikely that there would be any kind of a bust in their property line that would lead to a conflict between these 2 owners.

[Captioner] 19:48:30
CLEAR OVER THE YEARS WHERE THAT LINE MIGHT BE, MIGHT NOT BE

[Captioner] 19:48:34
 WELL  DELINEATED.
BUT I WOULD SAY IT WOULD BE

[Captioner] 19:48:37
 EXTREMELY UNLIKELY THAT THERE WOULD BE ANY KIND OF

[Captioner] 19:48:40
 A BUST IN THEIR PROPERTY LINE THAT WOULD LEAD TO A CONFLICT

[Joel Pullen (Planning Commission Secretary)] 19:48:40
This this property, as well well surveyed in preparation for this to development and that would be known to both parties.

[Captioner] 19:48:44
 BETWEEN THESE TWO PROPERTY OWNERS.
THIS PROPERTY IS

[Captioner] 19:48:47
 WELL SURVEYED IN PREPARATION FOR THIS DEVELOPMENT AND

[Joel Pullen (Planning Commission Secretary)] 19:48:48
so it's likely that say, you know a standard, you know, 4 foot or something like that that's allowed, or 5 foot.

[Captioner] 19:48:50
 THAT WOULD BE KNOWN TO BOTH PARTIES.
SO IT'S LIKELY THAT'S

[Captioner] 19:48:53
 A, YOU KNOW, STANDARD, YOU KNOW, FOUR FOOT OR

[Captioner] 19:48:56
 SOMETHING LIKE THAT THAT'S ALLOWED.
OR A FIVE FOOT SOMETIMES

[Captioner] 19:48:59
 SEPARATION ON THAT BACK SIDE.


[Jasmine Basrai (Commissioner)] 19:49:00
thank you. Clarification.

[Robert Daulton (PC Chairperson)] 19:49:03

[Robert Daulton (PC Chairperson)] 19:49:15
I I had the exact same thought when I saw what appeared to be a concrete foundation, poured behind the house.

[Captioner] 19:49:16
 AS WELL.
I HAD THE EXACT SAME THOUGHT WHEN I

 SAW WHAT APPEARED TO BE A CONCRETE
