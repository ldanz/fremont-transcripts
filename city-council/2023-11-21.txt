[Captioner] 19:03:21
MAYOR.

[Captioner] 19:03:23
I WAS JUST GOING TO MAKE A 

[Captioner] 19:03:23

I WOULD LIKE TO MOVE THAT WE

THE FOLLOWING COUNCILMEMBERS OUT 

[Captioner] 19:03:57

[Captioner] 19:03:57

AND THOSE ARE ITEMS THAT ARE NOT 

[Captioner] 19:04:01

[Captioner] 19:04:05
AND SO COMMUNICATIONS AGAIN WILL 

[Captioner] 19:04:09

YOU'RE SPEAKING AND ARE LOOKING 

[Captioner] 19:04:33
FOR A COMMENT, THE COUNCIL 

[Captioner] 19:04:34
CANNOT TAKE ACTION NOR RESPOND 

[Captioner] 19:04:36
TO ITEMS BROUGHT UP UNDER ORAL 

[Captioner] 19:04:37
COMMUNICATIONS COMMENT PERIOD.

[Captioner] 19:04:38
HOWEVER, THE ITEM COULD BE 

[Captioner] 19:04:41
AGENDIZED FOR A FUTURE MEETING 

[Captioner] 19:04:42
AND IF THE COUNCIL MAKES A 

[Captioner] 19:04:43

[Captioner] 19:05:19
>> THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR AND 

[Captioner] 19:05:19
CITY COUNCIL.

[Captioner] 19:05:21
SO FOR THE PAST TWO MONTHS, 

[Captioner] 19:05:25
MAYOR MEI HAS BEEN DUTIFULLY 

[Captioner] 19:05:27
ASKING CONSTITUENTS TO PROVIDE 

[Captioner] 19:05:29
INPUTS FOR THE ACTIVE 

[Captioner] 19:05:32
TRANSPORTATION PLAN, AND THE 

[Captioner] 19:05:33
PUBLIC PERIOD -- INPUT PERIOD 

[Captioner] 19:05:34
HAS RECENTLY CLOSED.

[Captioner] 19:05:37
I'M HAPPY TO SAY THAT THERE ARE 

[Captioner] 19:05:39
HUNDREDS OF INPUTS FROM ALL OF 

[Captioner] 19:05:43
YOUR CONSTITUENTS ON THAT PLAN.

[Captioner] 19:05:45
I'LL SAY STAFF DID A WONDERFUL 

[Captioner] 19:05:47
JOB OF ENABLING THAT TOOL, 

[Captioner] 19:05:50
REACHING OUT TO THE PUBLIC, AND 

[Captioner] 19:05:52
ALLOWING THOSE INPUTS TO BE 

[Captioner] 19:05:53
ENTERED, SO I'M GOING TO TURN 

[Captioner] 19:05:57
THE REQUEST AROUND AND SAY CITY 

[Captioner] 19:05:58
COUNCIL, MADAME MAYOR, PLEASE 

[Captioner] 19:06:01
OPEN THE ATP MAP AND TAKE A LOOK 

[Captioner] 19:06:02
WITHIN YOUR DISTRICT AT THE 

[Captioner] 19:06:04
DOZENS OF COMMENTS THAT YOU WILL 

[Captioner] 19:06:06
FIND WITHIN YOUR DISTRICT.

[Captioner] 19:06:08
THERE ARE MANY COMMENTS.

[Captioner] 19:06:10
I'VE LOOKED THROUGH -- BROWSED 

[Captioner] 19:06:10
THROUGH MANY OF THEM.

[Captioner] 19:06:12
THEY ARE QUITE GOOD.

[Captioner] 19:06:18
THESE ARE ALL OF OUR CITY 

[Captioner] 19:06:20
MEMBERS WHO ARE REVIEWING WITHIN 

[Captioner] 19:06:22
YOUR DISTRICT AREAS THAT CAN USE 

[Captioner] 19:06:24
IMPROVEMENT FOR A WIDE RANGE, 

[Captioner] 19:06:25
SOME FACILITIES THAT NEED 

[Captioner] 19:06:26
IMPROVEMENT, PEOPLE TRYING TO 

[Captioner] 19:06:27
GET TO SCHOOL.

[Captioner] 19:06:29
REMEMBER, SAFE ROUTES TO SCHOOL 

[Captioner] 19:06:31
ONLY LOOKED AROUND HALF A MILE 

[Captioner] 19:06:32
AROUND SCHOOL.

[Captioner] 19:06:35
SO THERE ARE MANY, MANY PARENTS 

[Captioner] 19:06:38
WHO ARE POINTING OUT AREAS THAT 

[Captioner] 19:06:41
COULD STILL USE IMPROVEMENTS, A 

[Captioner] 19:06:43
LOT OF AREAS OF LAND USE, ACCESS 

[Captioner] 19:06:44
TO PUBLIC SPACES, IT'S ALL 

[Captioner] 19:06:45
THERE.

[Captioner] 19:06:47
IT COVERS A HUGE RANGE, AND VERY 

[Captioner] 19:06:48
POSITIVE COMMENTS, REALLY 

[Captioner] 19:06:51
ENCOURAGE YOU TO TAKE AN HOUR OR 

[Captioner] 19:06:52
TWO AND BROWSE THROUGH THE MAPS 

[Captioner] 19:06:55
IN YOUR DISTRICT AND YOU'LL, I 

[Captioner] 19:06:57
THINK, BE PLEASANTLY SURPRISED 

[Captioner] 19:06:59
BY WHAT YOU'LL SEE AND THEN CAN 

[Captioner] 19:07:00
TRY TO MAKE SOME CONSTRUCTIVE 

[Captioner] 19:07:01
ACTIONS.

[Captioner] 19:07:01
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

[Captioner] 19:07:06
>> Ms. Gauthier: THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 19:07:08
THE NEXT SPEAKER IS SARABI 

[Captioner] 19:07:11
FOLLOWED BY DANIEL.

[Captioner] 19:07:14
>> HI.

[Captioner] 19:07:17
I'M SARABI, A SENIOR FROM 

[Captioner] 19:07:18
AMERICAN HIGH SCHOOL, AND MY 

[Captioner] 19:07:20
COMMENT IS ABOUT THE CROSSWALK 

[Captioner] 19:07:27
ON THE INTERSECTION OF SURI AND 

[Captioner] 19:07:27
PASEO PADRE BEHIND BROOKVALE.

[Captioner] 19:07:29
IT'S PRETTY DANGEROUS FOR 

[Captioner] 19:07:30
STUDENTS TO CROSS BECAUSE 

[Captioner] 19:07:31
ALTHOUGH THERE'S A SIGN AND 

[Captioner] 19:07:32
BLINKING LIGHTS, THERE'S A CURVE 

[Captioner] 19:07:34
AROUND THAT AREA AND IT'S 40 

[Captioner] 19:07:36
MILES PER HOUR SPEED LIMIT, SO 

[Captioner] 19:07:36
IT'S PRETTY DANGEROUS FOR 

[Captioner] 19:07:38
STUDENTS TO WALK THERE.

[Captioner] 19:07:40
AND THERE HAVE BEEN MANY CASES 

[Captioner] 19:07:41
IN THE PAST WHERE CARS HAVE 

[Captioner] 19:07:43
STOPPED TO WAIT BUT THEY HAVE 

[Captioner] 19:07:44
BEEN REAR-ENDED BY PEOPLE WHO 

[Captioner] 19:07:45
COULD NOT SEE THE BLINKING 

[Captioner] 19:07:46
LIGHTS FROM FAR AWAY.

[Captioner] 19:07:48
SO CAN YOU PLEASE CONSIDER 

[Captioner] 19:07:50
LOOKING INTO INSTALLING A 

[Captioner] 19:07:51
TRAFFIC SIGNAL AT THE 

[Captioner] 19:07:51
INTERSECTION?

[Captioner] 19:07:51
THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 19:07:58
>> Ms. Gauthier: THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 19:08:00
THE NEXT SPEAKER IS DANIEL 

[Captioner] 19:08:01
FOLLOWED BY KELLY.

[Captioner] 19:08:07
>> GOOD EVENING, COUNCILMEMBERS 

[Captioner] 19:08:07
AND MAYOR.

[Captioner] 19:08:11
I WANTED TO KIND OF ECHO WHAT 

[Captioner] 19:08:11
STEVE SAID.

[Captioner] 19:08:14
THERE ARE OVER 900 SUBMISSIONS 

[Captioner] 19:08:19
TO THE ATP PHASE TWO MAP.

[Captioner] 19:08:23
IN MY OPINION, MOST OF THOSE ARE 

[Captioner] 19:08:24
REALLY GREAT SUBMISSIONS.

[Captioner] 19:08:28
VERY, YOU KNOW -- THERE'S MANY 

[Captioner] 19:08:31
PEOPLE IN THE CITY WHO HAVE A 

[Captioner] 19:08:35
LOT OF EXPERIENCE RIDING BIKES, 

[Captioner] 19:08:37
WALKING, YOU KNOW, AND THEY'RE 

[Captioner] 19:08:39
EXPERTS IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD OR 

[Captioner] 19:08:41
ON THEIR COMMUTE OR, YOU KNOW, 

[Captioner] 19:08:41
WHEREVER THEY'RE GOING.

[Captioner] 19:08:46
MUCH MORE SO THAN ANY ONE PERSON 

[Captioner] 19:08:50
OR ANY ONE TEAM CAN REALLY DO.

[Captioner] 19:08:52
SO I WOULD REALLY ECHO WHAT 

[Captioner] 19:08:53
STEVE WAS SAYING.

[Captioner] 19:08:56
GO LOOK AT YOUR DISTRICT, GO 

[Captioner] 19:09:00
LOOK AT YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD, GO 

[Captioner] 19:09:02
LOOK AT SOME OF THE PLACES THAT 

[Captioner] 19:09:04
HAVE HAD PROJECTS COMPLETED 

[Captioner] 19:09:05
RECENTLY FOR SAFETY 

[Captioner] 19:09:07
IMPROVEMENTS, FOR BIKE LANES, 

[Captioner] 19:09:10
FOR SAFER CROSSWALKS, SEE WHAT 

[Captioner] 19:09:11
THE COMMENTS ARE THERE.

[Captioner] 19:09:13
GO LOOK AT PLACES THAT HAVE NOT 

[Captioner] 19:09:21
BEEN TOUCHED IN THE LAST DECADE, 

[Captioner] 19:09:24
MOWRY, PERALTA, GO LOOK AT THE 

[Captioner] 19:09:25
PLACES -- OH, THIS IS A GREAT 

[Captioner] 19:09:27
SAFE PLACE, SEE WHAT PEOPLE ARE 

[Captioner] 19:09:27
SAYING.

[Captioner] 19:09:29
I MEAN, YOU PROBABLY KNOW WHAT 

[Captioner] 19:09:32
PLACES ARE DANGEROUS AND THE 

[Captioner] 19:09:32
STAFF KNOW AS WELL.

[Captioner] 19:09:37
JUST AS AN EXAMPLE, ON MY RIDE 

[Captioner] 19:09:41
HERE TODAY, COMING FROM DISTRICT 

[Captioner] 19:09:44
2, BROOKVALE, I HAVE TO GO 

[Captioner] 19:09:46
AROUND FOUR CARS PARKED IN THE 

[Captioner] 19:09:46
BIKE LANE.

[Captioner] 19:09:51
THAT'S ACTUALLY LOW FOR THIS 

[Captioner] 19:09:53
RIDE FROM FREMONT BOULEVARD.

[Captioner] 19:09:57
AVERAGE IS AROUND FIVE.

[Captioner] 19:10:03
I HAD TO -- I GOT PAST TWICE AT 

[Captioner] 19:10:05
AN UNSAFE DISTANCE AND UNSAFE 

[Captioner] 19:10:05
SPEED.

[Captioner] 19:10:08
HI TO MAKE A THREE-LANE MERGE TO 

[Captioner] 19:10:10
GET INTO THE LEFT TURN LANE TO 

[Captioner] 19:10:12
GET TO FREMONT'S DOWNTOWN, AND 

[Captioner] 19:10:14
THEN I SPENT ABOUT SIX OR SEVEN 

[Captioner] 19:10:16
MINUTES WAITING AT THE LEFT TURN 

[Captioner] 19:10:18
BECAUSE THAT LEFT TURN DOESN'T 

[Captioner] 19:10:19
DETECT BIKES YET, SO I HAD TO 

[Captioner] 19:10:24
WAIT FOR A SAVIOR OR A CAR TO 

[Captioner] 19:10:25
COME BY BEHIND ME AND TRIP THAT 

[Captioner] 19:10:26
LIGHT FOR ME.

[Captioner] 19:10:30
SO WE HAVE DONE A LOT, WE'VE 

[Captioner] 19:10:32
COME A LONG WAY.

[Captioner] 19:10:34
BUT WE STILL HAVE A LONG WAY TO 

[Captioner] 19:10:34
GO.

[Captioner] 19:10:38
SO DON'T LET UP, DON'T SLOW 

[Captioner] 19:10:38
DOWN.

[Captioner] 19:10:40
WE HAVE A LOT MORE WORK TO DO.

[Captioner] 19:10:45
HOPEFULLY THE MAP, THE ATP MAP 

[Captioner] 19:10:46
SHOWS YOU WHERE YOU NEED TO GO.

[Captioner] 19:10:46
THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 19:11:02
>> A LOT OF THIS COUNCIL 

[Captioner] 19:11:06
SOMETIMES SUFFERS FROM A SHORT 

[Captioner] 19:11:07
MEMORY, AMNESIA.

[Captioner] 19:11:09
WHEN A MILLION PEOPLE CAME IN 

[Captioner] 19:11:11
HERE AND ASKED ABOUT PARKING 

[Captioner] 19:11:12
ENFORCEMENT AS WE JUST HEARD ONE 

[Captioner] 19:11:14
MINUTE AGO, PARKING ENFORCEMENT, 

[Captioner] 19:11:20
 AND THE ANSWER IS, WELL, WE 

[Captioner] 19:11:22
DON'T HAVE PARKING ENFORCEMENT 

[Captioner] 19:11:22
RESOURCES, WHATEVER.

[Captioner] 19:11:24
YOU PASSED -- A YEAR OR TWO AGO, 

[Captioner] 19:11:27
YOU APPROVED THE HIRING OF THREE 

[Captioner] 19:11:27
PARKING COMPLIANCE OFFICERS.

[Captioner] 19:11:29
REMEMBER THAT?

[Captioner] 19:11:31
THEY COST $360,000 A YEAR.

[Captioner] 19:11:33
WE LOOKED UP THE NUMBERS.

[Captioner] 19:11:36
THE TOTAL COMPENSATION OF THESE 

[Captioner] 19:11:36
THREE INDIVIDUALS.

[Captioner] 19:11:38
AND THEY'RE OUT THERE SUPPOSEDLY 

[Captioner] 19:11:40
DOING PARKING COMPLIANCE.

[Captioner] 19:11:44
SO YOU KNOW, LET'S NOT KID EACH 

[Captioner] 19:11:44
OTHER.

[Captioner] 19:11:46
WE'VE BEEN PUMPING IN THE 

[Captioner] 19:11:46
RESOURCES, RIGHT?

[Captioner] 19:11:50
AND RESOURCES ARE OUT THERE, AND 

[Captioner] 19:11:52
IT'S SELECTIVE ENFORCEMENT, 

[Captioner] 19:11:53
RIGHT, BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE A 

[Captioner] 19:11:56
LOT OF IT'S BEEN -- THIS COUNCIL 

[Captioner] 19:11:57
SPENT HOURS TALKING ABOUT THE 

[Captioner] 19:11:59
NEED TO GO ENFORCE PARKING AT 

[Captioner] 19:12:00
MISSION PEAK, RIGHT?

[Captioner] 19:12:01
MISSION PEAK.

[Captioner] 19:12:03
THAT WAS WHERE WE WERE GOING TO 

[Captioner] 19:12:04
BE -- BUT IT TURNS OUT THERE 

[Captioner] 19:12:06
MIGHT BE PARKING ENFORCEMENT 

[Captioner] 19:12:07
NEEDS ELSEWHERE.

[Captioner] 19:12:09
AND THEN LET'S TALK ABOUT THE 

[Captioner] 19:12:10
BUDGET RESERVES.

[Captioner] 19:12:13
THE UNCERTAINTY RESERVE IS NOT 

[Captioner] 19:12:16
INTENDED TO COVER OR HIDE OR 

[Captioner] 19:12:18
SWEEP UNDER THE RUG ACCOUNTING 

[Captioner] 19:12:18
MISTAKES.

[Captioner] 19:12:20
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU HAVE 

[Captioner] 19:12:23
ACCOUNTING BOONDOGGLES IN THE 

[Captioner] 19:12:25
FRONT PAGE OF THE NEWSPAPER, 

[Captioner] 19:12:27
YOUR ACCOUNTING MISTAKES IS NOT 

[Captioner] 19:12:28
JUST, OH, LOOK, WE HAVE MONEY IN 

[Captioner] 19:12:30
THE BANK, WE CAN JUST USE THAT 

[Captioner] 19:12:30
TO PAY.

[Captioner] 19:12:30
RIGHT?

[Captioner] 19:12:34
BUT THAT'S NOT HOW IT SHOULD 

[Captioner] 19:12:34
BE.

[Captioner] 19:12:36
IN FACT, WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN IS 

[Captioner] 19:12:38
YOU SHOULD BRING BACK THAT SALES 

[Captioner] 19:12:42
TAX REVENUE CONSULTANT AND HAVE 

[Captioner] 19:12:43
THEM -- THIS IS THEIR SPECIALTY.

[Captioner] 19:12:44
THIS IS THEIR JOB.

[Captioner] 19:12:46
LET THEM GO AND FIGURE OUT 

[Captioner] 19:12:46
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE.

[Captioner] 19:12:47
DON'T RELY ON THE STATE.

[Captioner] 19:12:50
YOU HAD ONE, A SALES TAX REVENUE 

[Captioner] 19:12:50
CONSULTANT.

[Captioner] 19:12:52
ALSO, YOU HAVE SOMETHING CALLED 

[Captioner] 19:12:52
INDEPENDENT AUDITORS.

[Captioner] 19:12:56
YOUR INDEPENDENT AUDITORS SHOULD 

[Captioner] 19:12:59
REPORT DIRECTLY TO THIS COUNCIL 

[Captioner] 19:13:02
AND THEY SHOULD TELL YOU -- LOOK 

[Captioner] 19:13:03
INTO THIS PROBLEM AND FIGURE OUT 

[Captioner] 19:13:04
WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT.

[Captioner] 19:13:06
IN FACT, THEY SHOULD RESTATE THE 

[Captioner] 19:13:08
INCORRECT FINANCIAL REPORTS FOR 

[Captioner] 19:13:09
THE LAST MORE THAN A YEAR, IT'S 

[Captioner] 19:13:11
NOT JUST ONE YEAR, IT'S PROBABLY 

[Captioner] 19:13:12
SEVERAL YEARS OF INCORRECT 

[Captioner] 19:13:15
FINANCIAL REPORTS BASED ON, YOU 

[Captioner] 19:13:17
KNOW, OVERESTIMATES OF SALES TAX 

[Captioner] 19:13:17
REVENUES.

[Captioner] 19:13:21
AND MAYBE REVISE THE FUTURE 

[Captioner] 19:13:23
REVENUE FORECAST WHICH YOU'VE 

[Captioner] 19:13:25
ALREADY REVISED UPWARDS BY 30% 

[Captioner] 19:13:28
AS OF LAST MARCH, WELL, THAT 

[Captioner] 19:13:29
REVISION WAS PERHAPS INCORRECT.

[Captioner] 19:13:32
AND NEEDS TO BE RE-REVISED.

[Captioner] 19:13:35
AND PERHAPS SET UP A BOARD 

[Captioner] 19:13:38
FINANCE SUBCOMMITTEE OF THE MOST 

[Captioner] 19:13:41
DEDICATED AND, YOU KNOW, THE 

[Captioner] 19:13:45
MOST -- THE PEOPLE WITH THE 

[Captioner] 19:13:46
GREEN ON SHADES ON THIS BOARD, 

[Captioner] 19:13:48
ON THIS CITY COUNCIL, WHO CAN 

[Captioner] 19:13:50
LOOK AT THE BUDGET AND, YOU 

[Captioner] 19:13:51
KNOW, MONITOR EVERYTHING FROM 

[Captioner] 19:13:52
HERE ON OUT.

[Captioner] 19:13:52
THANKS.

[Captioner] 19:13:58
>> Ms. Gauthier: THAT WAS THE 

[Captioner] 19:14:00
LAST SPEAKER FOR ORAL 

[Captioner] 19:14:00
COMMUNICATIONS.

[Captioner] 19:14:02
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 19:14:04
AND THEN I THINK WE HAVE TO 

[Captioner] 19:14:05
RETURN TO THE CONSENT CALENDAR?

[Captioner] 19:14:07
>> Ms. Gauthier: CORRECT, 2D.

[Captioner] 19:14:11
THE SPEAKER IS MALIA.

[Captioner] 19:14:22
>> HELLO, MY NAME IS MALAI CRUZ 

[Captioner] 19:14:23
AND I COME FROM AMERICAN HIGH 

[Captioner] 19:14:23
SCHOOL.

[Captioner] 19:14:29
I WAS LOOKING INTO THE 2D 

[Captioner] 19:14:30
ACTIVITY, AND I UNDERSTAND THAT 

[Captioner] 19:14:33
THE CITY OF FREMONT IS TRYING TO 

[Captioner] 19:14:35
CONVERT THE CITY'S FLEET 

[Captioner] 19:14:36
VEHICLES TO ELECTRONIC VEHICLES 

[Captioner] 19:14:39
AND I THINK THAT'S A REALLY GOOD 

[Captioner] 19:14:41
STEP FORWARD TO PROMOTING 

[Captioner] 19:14:42
ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY IN 

[Captioner] 19:14:42
OUR CITY.

[Captioner] 19:14:43
THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 19:14:51
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 19:14:53
ARE THERE ANY COMMENTS OR 

[Captioner] 19:14:54
QUESTIONS FROM THE -- I'LL JUST 

[Captioner] 19:14:56
MAKE A GENERAL ONE FIRST AND 

[Captioner] 19:14:57
THANK YOU FOR THE PUBLIC SPEAKER 

[Captioner] 19:14:57
ON THAT.

[Captioner] 19:15:00
I KNOW THAT OUR CITY HAS 

[Captioner] 19:15:02
RECENTLY UPDATED OUR CLIMATE 

[Captioner] 19:15:04
ACTION PLAN AND THE GOALS OF US 

[Captioner] 19:15:05
TRYING TO ELECTRIFY OUR FLEET 

[Captioner] 19:15:06
ARE CONSISTENT WITH SOME OF 

[Captioner] 19:15:07
THOSE OBJECTIVES.

[Captioner] 19:15:09
AND WE APPRECIATE THE FEEDBACK 

[Captioner] 19:15:11
AND I THINK A LOT OF IT IS THE 

[Captioner] 19:15:12
THOUGHTFULNESS IN OUR 

[Captioner] 19:15:15
PROCUREMENT AND ALSO HOW WE MOVE 

[Captioner] 19:15:17
FORWARD IN TERMS OF BOTH LONG 

[Captioner] 19:15:18
TERM REPLACEMENT FLEET COSTS AS 

[Captioner] 19:15:20
WELL AS THE MAINTENANCE COSTS, 

[Captioner] 19:15:21
SO THAT'S SOME OF THE THINGS 

[Captioner] 19:15:22
THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT.

[Captioner] 19:15:23
SO THANK YOU FOR THE COMMENT.

[Captioner] 19:15:26

HOWEVER, FOR THESE PARTICULAR 

[Captioner] 19:15:59
VEHICLES THAT IS BEING 

[Captioner] 19:16:01
RECOMMENDED FOR US, THEY DO NOT 

[Captioner] 19:16:03
COME -- THESE MODELS DO NOT COME 

[Captioner] 19:16:06
WITH ZERO EMISSIONS TECHNOLOGY 

[Captioner] 19:16:07
UNFORTUNATELY.

[Captioner] 19:16:08
NOT FOR THESE PARTICULAR ONES.

[Captioner] 19:16:11
BUT FOR OUR POLICE VEHICLES AND 

[Captioner] 19:16:13
SOME OTHER VEHICLES, THAT IS THE 

[Captioner] 19:16:14
GOAL FOR THE CITY.

[Captioner] 19:16:16
SO JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY THAT 

[Captioner] 19:16:17
SO YOU KNEW.

[Captioner] 19:16:17
THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 19:16:21

NOTE THAT COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN 

[Captioner] 19:16:26
HAS JOINED US TOO.

[Captioner] 19:16:27

[Captioner] 19:16:27
WAS NOTED.

[Captioner] 19:16:28
PLEASE VOTE.

[Captioner] 19:16:37
THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 19:16:39

[Captioner] 19:16:40
UNANIMOUSLY WITH COUNCILMEMBER 

[Captioner] 19:16:42

[Captioner] 19:16:44
THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 19:16:48
NEXT IS AC TRANSIT, WHO IS GOING 

[Captioner] 19:16:50
TO BE PRESENTING A REALIGNMENT 

[Captioner] 19:16:50
PRESENTATION.

[Captioner] 19:16:55
AND I APPRECIATE THEM COMING.

[Captioner] 19:16:59
I KNOW MANY OF THE STUDENTS IN 

[Captioner] 19:17:00
THE PAST IN THIS LAST COUPLE 

[Captioner] 19:17:02
WEEKS DURING THE MANAGEMENT PLAN 

[Captioner] 19:17:04
AS WELL AS JUST COMMUNITY 

[Captioner] 19:17:05
MEMBERS, BECAUSE WE AS A CITY 

[Captioner] 19:17:08
HAVE JOINT MEETINGS WITH OUR 

[Captioner] 19:17:09
SCHOOL DISTRICT, HAVE HAD 

[Captioner] 19:17:10
PARENTS AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS 

[Captioner] 19:17:13
ASK US ABOUT AC TRANSIT SERVICES 

[Captioner] 19:17:15
AS IT PERTAINS TO THE SCHOOL 

[Captioner] 19:17:17
SITES AS WELL AS IN GENERAL.

[Captioner] 19:17:20
SO I WAS VERY EXCITED TO BE ABLE 

[Captioner] 19:17:21
TO HAVE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO 

[Captioner] 19:17:23
CONNECT WITH AC TRANSIT AND HAVE 

[Captioner] 19:17:25
A PRESENTATION TO BETTER EXPLAIN 

[Captioner] 19:17:27
SOME OF THE PROCESSES BY WHICH 

[Captioner] 19:17:29
YOU ARE DETERMINING YOUR 

[Captioner] 19:17:29
REALIGNMENT OF YOUR SERVICES.

[Captioner] 19:17:32
SO WELCOME, AND TONIGHT THIS IS 

[Captioner] 19:17:34
MICHAEL ESHELMAN WHO IS THE 

[Captioner] 19:17:35
SERVICE PLANNING MANAGER.

[Captioner] 19:17:35
THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 19:17:36
WELCOME.

[Captioner] 19:17:40
>> THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 19:17:42
GOOD EVENING, MAYOR MEI, 

[Captioner] 19:17:43
COUNCILMEMBERS, CITY MANAGER 

[Captioner] 19:17:44
SHACKELFORD, STAFF AND THE 

[Captioner] 19:17:44
PUBLIC.

[Captioner] 19:17:50
MY NAME IS MICHAEL ESHELMAN.

[Captioner] 19:17:51
I NEED TO TURN ON THE MIC.

[Captioner] 19:17:52
THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 19:17:58
SO IF WE CAN BRING UP THE SLIDE 

[Captioner] 19:18:00
-- PERFECT.

[Captioner] 19:18:01
I'M GOING TO GO A LITTLE FAST 

[Captioner] 19:18:02
THROUGH SOME OF THE SLIDES AND 

[Captioner] 19:18:03
SPEND A LITTLE MORE TIME ON SOME 

[Captioner] 19:18:05
OF THE OTHER SLIDES, JUST TO 

[Captioner] 19:18:06
MAKE SURE THAT WE MAKE THE MOST 

[Captioner] 19:18:09
OF OUR TIME.

[Captioner] 19:18:11
SO ONE OF THE THINGS WE'RE 

[Captioner] 19:18:13
REALLY PROUD OF IS AC TRANSIT IS 

[Captioner] 19:18:15
THE LARGEST BUS-ONLY AGENCY IN 

[Captioner] 19:18:15
CALIFORNIA.

[Captioner] 19:18:18
ONE OF THE LARGEST IN THE UNITED 

[Captioner] 19:18:18
STATES.

[Captioner] 19:18:20
WE OPERATE BUS SERVICE ON THE 

[Captioner] 19:18:22
WESTERN SIDE OF THE HILLS IN 

[Captioner] 19:18:24
ALAMEDA AND CONTRACOSTA COUNTY, 

[Captioner] 19:18:28
SO WE'RE TALKING FROM FREMONT -- 

[Captioner] 19:18:30
FROM RICHMOND DOWN TO FREMONT.

[Captioner] 19:18:33
ONE KEY FACT I WANT TO PULL OFF 

[Captioner] 19:18:35
THE SLIDE IS THAT 43% OF OUR 

[Captioner] 19:18:37
RIDERS ARE TRANSIT-DEPENDENT, 

[Captioner] 19:18:38
MEANING THEY DON'T HAVE ACCESS 

[Captioner] 19:18:39
TO A CAR IN THEIR HOUSEHOLD.

[Captioner] 19:18:46
SO THIS MAP AND TABLE SHOW OUR 

[Captioner] 19:18:46
NETWORK AND LINES THAT OPERATE 

[Captioner] 19:18:48
IN THE FREMONT AREA.

[Captioner] 19:18:50
THE LINES IN RED ARE MOST 

[Captioner] 19:18:51
FREQUENT SERVICE RUNNING 20 

[Captioner] 19:18:54
MINUTES OR BETTER ALONG FREMONT 

[Captioner] 19:18:56
BOULEVARD, DECOTO, MOWRY.

[Captioner] 19:18:59
FINALLY ROUTES SHOWN IN GRAY ARE 

[Captioner] 19:19:00
THOSE THAT VARY IN FREQUENCY.

[Captioner] 19:19:03
THESE ARE TRANS BAY LINES, EARLY 

[Captioner] 19:19:03
BIRD SERVICE OR OVERNIGHT 

[Captioner] 19:19:03
SERVICE.

[Captioner] 19:19:05
I DO WANT TO KNOW WHERE THERE 

[Captioner] 19:19:07
ARE OVERLAPPING LINES, WE MAY 

[Captioner] 19:19:09
HAVE BETTER FREQUENCY THAN THE 

[Captioner] 19:19:10
COLOR OF THE LINE MIGHT 

[Captioner] 19:19:10
INDICATE.

[Captioner] 19:19:14
SO WHAT IS REALIGN?

[Captioner] 19:19:16
WE'RE LOOKING AT UPDATING OUR 

[Captioner] 19:19:18
ENTIRE SERVICE NETWORK, SO WHERE 

[Captioner] 19:19:20
DO PEOPLE GO, WHERE ARE THEY 

[Captioner] 19:19:22
COMING FROM AND HOW CAN WE 

[Captioner] 19:19:23
REALIGN OUR NETWORK SO THAT 

[Captioner] 19:19:24
WE'RE BETTER MEETING MOBILITY 

[Captioner] 19:19:26
NEEDS PARTICULARLY COMING OUT OF 

[Captioner] 19:19:28
THE PANDEMIC, PEOPLE ARE MOVING 

[Captioner] 19:19:28
A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY AND WHICH 

[Captioner] 19:19:31
WANT TO MAKE SURE OUR SERVICE 

[Captioner] 19:19:32
NETWORK IS RESPONSIVE TO HOW 

[Captioner] 19:19:35
PEOPLE ARE MOVING AROUND THE 

[Captioner] 19:19:35
SERVICE AREA.

[Captioner] 19:19:37
SO OUR RIDERSHIP IS ACTUALLY 

[Captioner] 19:19:40
BACK UP TO 75% OF PREPANDEMIC.

[Captioner] 19:19:43
THIS IS PRETTY GOOD RIDERSHIP 

[Captioner] 19:19:45
RECOVERY AMONG OTHER TRANSIT 

[Captioner] 19:19:46
AGENCIES THROUGHOUT THE NATION 

[Captioner] 19:19:48
AND THAT RECOVERY HAS HAPPENED 

[Captioner] 19:19:49
REALLY ON MAJOR ROUTES, AND 

[Captioner] 19:19:51
OUTSIDE OF TRADITIONAL WORK 

[Captioner] 19:19:52
HOURS, SO WE'RE TALKING 

[Captioner] 19:19:54
WEEKENDS, MIDDAY, NIGHTTIME, ET 

[Captioner] 19:19:54
CETERA.

[Captioner] 19:19:56
WE'RE DOING THE WORK NOW BECAUSE 

[Captioner] 19:20:01
OF THE WAY PEOPLE MOVE HAS 

[Captioner] 19:20:01
SHIFTED.

[Captioner] 19:20:03
HIRING AND RETENTION IS REALLY 

[Captioner] 19:20:04
HARD AND CHALLENGES WITH FUNDING 

[Captioner] 19:20:06
AND REVENUE TO SUPPORT 

[Captioner] 19:20:07
SUSTAINABLE SERVICE.

[Captioner] 19:20:10
WE CAN ACTUALLY SKIP THIS ONE 

[Captioner] 19:20:11
AND MOVE INTO THE PHASE BECAUSE 

[Captioner] 19:20:13
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE 

[Captioner] 19:20:13
TALK ABOUT THE TIMELINE.

[Captioner] 19:20:15
SO WE'RE IN PHASE THREE RIGHT NOW.

[Captioner] 19:20:18
YOU SEE HIGHLIGHTED IN GREEN.

[Captioner] 19:20:21
TO DATE WE'VE SOLICIT AND HEARD 

[Captioner] 19:20:22
COMMUNITY UPDATE ON TRANSIT 

[Captioner] 19:20:24
NEEDS AND PRIORITIES FOLLOWING 

[Captioner] 19:20:26
THE FIRST TWO PHASES OF PUBLIC 

[Captioner] 19:20:26
ENGAGEMENT.

[Captioner] 19:20:28
THE INPUT WAS KEY TO THE 

[Captioner] 19:20:30
DEVELOPMENT OF DRAFT SERVICE 

[Captioner] 19:20:31
PLAN PROPOSALS AND WE'RE GOING 

[Captioner] 19:20:32
TO USE THAT INPUT GATHERED TODAY 

[Captioner] 19:20:34
AND THROUGHOUT THIS PHASE TO 

[Captioner] 19:20:36
REFINE THE DRAFT SERVICE PLAN, 

[Captioner] 19:20:38
SCENARIOS INTO ONE SINGLE 

[Captioner] 19:20:38
PREFERRED PLAN.

[Captioner] 19:20:40
WE'LL RETURN IN JANUARY FOR 

[Captioner] 19:20:41
ANOTHER ROUND OF PUBLIC INPUT.

[Captioner] 19:20:44
HOWEVER, NOW IS THE TIME TO HAVE 

[Captioner] 19:20:46
A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF IMPACT 

[Captioner] 19:20:47
ON WHAT THOSE PROPOSALS WILL 

[Captioner] 19:20:48
LOOK LIKE.

[Captioner] 19:20:50
WE'RE AIMING FOR BOARD ADOPTION 

[Captioner] 19:20:52
OF THE FINAL PLAN IN SPRING 

[Captioner] 19:20:54
2024, AND WE'RE SHOOTING FOR 

[Captioner] 19:20:55
IMPLEMENTATION OF A NEW NETWORK 

[Captioner] 19:20:55
IN AUGUST 2024.

[Captioner] 19:21:01
SO THE BOARD APPROVED THREE 

[Captioner] 19:21:01
GUIDING PRINCIPLES IN SEPTEMBER 

[Captioner] 19:21:03
THAT WERE REFINED BASED ON WHAT 

[Captioner] 19:21:04
WE HEARD FROM THE COMMUNITY AND 

[Captioner] 19:21:06
ARE SUMMARIZED ON THIS SLIDE AND 

[Captioner] 19:21:08
THOSE ARE EQUITY, RELIABILITY, 

[Captioner] 19:21:10
SO MAKING SURE THE BUS SHOWS UP 

[Captioner] 19:21:11
WHEN WE SAY IT'S GOING TO SHOW 

[Captioner] 19:21:12
UP AND MAKING SURE WE HAVE THE 

[Captioner] 19:21:13
RIGHT NUMBER OF OPERATORS TO 

[Captioner] 19:21:14
ACTUALLY OPERATE THE SERVICE 

[Captioner] 19:21:16
THAT WE PUT OUT ON A SCHEDULE, 

[Captioner] 19:21:16
AND THEN FREQUENCY.

[Captioner] 19:21:18
SO WE FOUND THAT THE PLACES 

[Captioner] 19:21:20
WHERE PEOPLE ARE RECOVERING THE 

[Captioner] 19:21:22
FASTEST, WHERE RIDERSHIP IS 

[Captioner] 19:21:23
RECOVERING FASTEST IS WHERE WE 

[Captioner] 19:21:25
RUN THE MOST -- THE BUSES COME 

[Captioner] 19:21:25
MOST OFTEN.

[Captioner] 19:21:32
SO WE HAVE THESE SERVICE 

[Captioner] 19:21:32
SCENARIOS.

[Captioner] 19:21:34
RIGHT NOW WE HAVE THREE, TWO OF 

[Captioner] 19:21:36
WHICH ARE COST-NEUTRAL AND ONE 

[Captioner] 19:21:37
OF WHICH IS COST CON TRAINED.

[Captioner] 19:21:39
THE TWO COST NEUTRAL ONES ARE 

[Captioner] 19:21:41
THE ONES WE'RE GOING TO FOCUS ON 

[Captioner] 19:21:43
TODAY AND I'LL TALK A LITTLE 

[Captioner] 19:21:45
ABOUT THE NOT COST NEUTRAL, THE 

[Captioner] 19:21:46
UNCONSTRAINED A LITTLE LATER.

[Captioner] 19:21:48
THESE TWO SCENARIOS ARE 

[Captioner] 19:21:49
DIFFERENT IN TERMS OF THE WAY 

[Captioner] 19:21:52
THAT THEY APPROACH ALLOCATING 

[Captioner] 19:21:53
THE LIMITED RESOURCES THAT WE 

[Captioner] 19:21:53
HAVE.

[Captioner] 19:21:55
BUT ACTUALLY FOR FREMONT, BOTH 

[Captioner] 19:21:57
SCENARIOS ARE THE SAME.

[Captioner] 19:21:58
SO THIS IS GOING TO MAKE THE 

[Captioner] 19:21:59
PRESENTATION A LITTLE BIT 

[Captioner] 19:22:00
SIMPLER AND MAKE IT A LITTLE BIT 

[Captioner] 19:22:01
EASIER TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WE'RE 

[Captioner] 19:22:02
PROPOSING IN FREMONT.

[Captioner] 19:22:08
AND BECAUSE THEY'RE BOTH THE 

[Captioner] 19:22:09
SAME, I'M GOING TO KIND OF GIVE 

[Captioner] 19:22:10
THIS SLIDE AND THEN WE CAN MOVE 

[Captioner] 19:22:12
INTO SOME OF THE ACTUAL PROPOSED 

[Captioner] 19:22:12
LINES ON A MAP.

[Captioner] 19:22:15
SO THE SCENARIO THAT WE'RE 

[Captioner] 19:22:19
 PROPOSING IN FREMONT IS 

[Captioner] 19:22:20
BALANCING COVERAGE, MAKING SURE 

[Captioner] 19:22:21
WE HAVE SERVICE SPREAD AS MUCH 

[Captioner] 19:22:22
AS POSSIBLE AND FREQUENCY, WHICH 

[Captioner] 19:22:23
IS MAKING SURE THAT THE LINES 

[Captioner] 19:22:25
ARE COMING AS FREQUENTLY AS 

[Captioner] 19:22:25
POSSIBLE.

[Captioner] 19:22:28
WE WANT TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO 

[Captioner] 19:22:30
MANY DESTINATIONS AND WE WANT TO 

[Captioner] 19:22:32
PROVIDE COVERAGE AND NEW 

[Captioner] 19:22:34
MOBILITY OPTIONS IN PLACES WHERE 

[Captioner] 19:22:35
WE HAVE TRANSIT DEMAND.

[Captioner] 19:22:36
WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE THE ROUTES 

[Captioner] 19:22:38
A LITTLE SIMPLER TO UNDERSTAND.

[Captioner] 19:22:39
SO THAT YOU KIND OF HAVE AN IDEA 

[Captioner] 19:22:41
WHERE THE BUS IS GOING WHEN YOU 

[Captioner] 19:22:41
GET ON IT.

[Captioner] 19:22:43
AND WE REALLY WANT TO MATCH THE 

[Captioner] 19:22:45
RIGHT SERVICE LEVELS TO THE 

[Captioner] 19:22:47
RIGHT COMMUNITIES.

[Captioner] 19:22:52
AND WE CAN ACTUALLY SKIP THIS 

[Captioner] 19:22:52
ONE.

[Captioner] 19:22:56
SO TALKING ABOUT THIS 

[Captioner] 19:22:56
UNCONSTRAINED VISION.

[Captioner] 19:22:57
SO THIS SCENARIO IS A LITTLE 

[Captioner] 19:23:00
DIFFERENT IN THAT IT DOES AIM TO 

[Captioner] 19:23:00
STAY WITHIN OUR MEANS.

[Captioner] 19:23:02
THE GENERAL SUMMARY OF THIS 

[Captioner] 19:23:03
SCENARIO IS MORE OF EVERYTHING 

[Captioner] 19:23:03
EVERYWHERE.

[Captioner] 19:23:05
IT RESTORES NEARLY ALL THE 

[Captioner] 19:23:06
SERVICE SUSPENDED DURING THE 

[Captioner] 19:23:06
PANDEMIC.

[Captioner] 19:23:08
AND MAKES SIGNIFICANT INCREASES 

[Captioner] 19:23:11
IN FREQUENCY ACROSS THE BOARD ON 

[Captioner] 19:23:11
EXISTING LINES.

[Captioner] 19:23:14
IT ALSO PROPOSES NEW LINES AND 

[Captioner] 19:23:15
SERVICE TO COMMUNITIES THAT 

[Captioner] 19:23:16
LACKED IT, EVEN BEFORE THE 

[Captioner] 19:23:16
PANDEMIC.

[Captioner] 19:23:19
IT ALSO INCLUDES THREE FLEXIBLE 

[Captioner] 19:23:19
SERVICE ZONES.

[Captioner] 19:23:22
WHILE AC TRANSIT DOESN'T HAVE 

[Captioner] 19:23:24
THE RESOURCES IN TERMS OF BUSES, 

[Captioner] 19:23:25
OPERATORS OR FUNDING TO ACHIEVE 

[Captioner] 19:23:26
THIS VISION TODAY, IT CAN BE 

[Captioner] 19:23:28
USED TO ADVOCATE FOR MORE 

[Captioner] 19:23:29
RESOURCES AND REPRESENTS OUR 

[Captioner] 19:23:33
VISION OF WHAT'S POSSIBLE FOR 

[Captioner] 19:23:35
FUNDING IF -- FUNDING FOR PUBLIC 

[Captioner] 19:23:38
TRANSIT IS A PRIORITY.

[Captioner] 19:23:41
SO I'M GOING TO GO OVER SOME OF 

[Captioner] 19:23:42
THE KEY LINES THAT SERVE FREMONT 

[Captioner] 19:23:43
IN THIS SECTION, BUT NOTE 

[Captioner] 19:23:45
THERE'S MUCH MORE DETAIL ON THE 

[Captioner] 19:23:48
WEBSITE AT 

[Captioner] 19:23:50
ACTRANSIT.ORG/REALIGN, INCLUDING 

[Captioner] 19:23:52
PROFILES OF EACH LINE, MAPS, AS 

[Captioner] 19:23:54
WELL AS AN INTERACTIVE TOOL THAT 

[Captioner] 19:23:56
ALLOWS YOU TO MAKE COMMENTS ON 

[Captioner] 19:23:56
SPECIFIC LINES.

[Captioner] 19:23:59
SO LINE 200 IS ONE OF THE MAJOR 

[Captioner] 19:24:00
LINES SERVING FREMONT.

[Captioner] 19:24:03
WE'RE PROPOSING TO ACTUALLY 

[Captioner] 19:24:06
EXTEND IT IN NEWARK, OTHERWISE 

[Captioner] 19:24:07
IT'S UNCHANGED IN FREMONT BUT 

[Captioner] 19:24:09
THERE'S NEW DEVELOPMENT CLOSER 

[Captioner] 19:24:12
TO THE BAY IN NEWARK ALONG 

[Captioner] 19:24:14
CENTRAL AND ENTERPRISE, WHERE WE 

[Captioner] 19:24:16
DON'T HAVE SERVICE TODAY AND 

[Captioner] 19:24:18
WE'RE PROPOSING TO EXTEND THE 

[Captioner] 19:24:19
SERVICE TO SERVE THAT.

[Captioner] 19:24:22
SO THIS LOOKS A LITTLE BIT LIKE 

[Captioner] 19:24:24
SOME SPAGHETTI, BUT ALL THESE 

[Captioner] 19:24:25
LINES ARE KIND OF INTERRELATED 

[Captioner] 19:24:27
AND ALL THE CHANGES KIND OF 

[Captioner] 19:24:27
AFFECT ONE ANOTHER.

[Captioner] 19:24:28
MANY OF THE CHANGES IN FREMONT 

[Captioner] 19:24:30
ARE FOCUSED ON CREATING A 

[Captioner] 19:24:31
SIMPLER NETWORK THAT WORKS 

[Captioner] 19:24:32
BETTER FOR CUSTOMERS AND BUS 

[Captioner] 19:24:32
DRIVERS.

[Captioner] 19:24:34
ALL LINES WILL COME EVERY 30 

[Captioner] 19:24:35
MINUTES IN FREMONT SO RIGHT NOW 

[Captioner] 19:24:37
WE HAVE A NUMBER OF LINES THAT 

[Captioner] 19:24:39
ONLY OPERATE EVERY HOUR, NO LINE 

[Captioner] 19:24:41
WILL COME LESS THAN EVERY 30 

[Captioner] 19:24:43
MINUTES IN FREMONT UNDER EET 

[Captioner] 19:24:44
PROPOSAL THAT'S COST NEUTRAL.

[Captioner] 19:24:47
HOWEVER, ONE OF THE TRADEOFFS IS 

[Captioner] 19:24:50
THAT WE'RE PROPOSING TO 

[Captioner] 19:24:51
ELIMINATE LINE 215 WHICH WILL BE 

[Captioner] 19:24:54
COVERED IN PART BY CHANGES TO 

[Captioner] 19:24:55
LINES 212, 217 AND 239 AS WELL 

[Captioner] 19:24:57
AS A NEW ON DEMAND TRANSIT ZONE 

[Captioner] 19:24:58
IN THE WARM SPRINGS AREA.

[Captioner] 19:25:01
AS YOU CAN SEE WITH THAT BLUE 

[Captioner] 19:25:01
AREA ON THE MAP.

[Captioner] 19:25:05
HOWEVER, IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT 

[Captioner] 19:25:07
TO NOTE THAT WITH THE LOSS OF 

[Captioner] 19:25:08
215, THE PART THAT IS NOT 

[Captioner] 19:25:10
COVERED BY OTHER LINES 

[Captioner] 19:25:12
EXTENSIONS IS THE AREA OF OSGOOD 

[Captioner] 19:25:14
BETWEEN WASHINGTON AND AUTOMALL 

[Captioner] 19:25:14
PARKWAY.

[Captioner] 19:25:21
SO THIS SLIDE SHOWS LINES 216 

[Captioner] 19:25:21
AND 232.

[Captioner] 19:25:23
LINE 232 IS PROPOSED TO BE 

[Captioner] 19:25:26
SHORTENED AT UNION CITY BART AND 

[Captioner] 19:25:27
LINE 216 WILL BE SHIFTED TO 

[Captioner] 19:25:28
COVER MISSION BOULEVARD PORTION 

[Captioner] 19:25:31
OF THE 232, LEAVING NILES 

[Captioner] 19:25:33
WITHOUT AC TRANSIT SERVICE 

[Captioner] 19:25:33
BETWEEN UNION CITY BART AND 

[Captioner] 19:25:34
NURSERY AVENUE.

[Captioner] 19:25:41
LINE 251 WILL KEEP THE SAME 

[Captioner] 19:25:43
ROUTING AS IT HAS TODAY BUT WILL 

[Captioner] 19:25:45
COME TWICE AS OFTEN AND ALSO 

[Captioner] 19:25:46
INCLUDE WEEKEND SERVICE AS WELL 

[Captioner] 19:25:47
AS RUN LATER IN THE DAY.

[Captioner] 19:25:51
ONE OF THE BIG CHANGES IS WHERE 

[Captioner] 19:25:54
IN FREMONT, WE'RE MAKING -- 

[Captioner] 19:25:57
WE'RE ELIMINATING LINE 99 AND 

[Captioner] 19:25:58
REPLACING IT WITH 299.

[Captioner] 19:26:00
LINE 10 WILL BE EXTENDED INTO 

[Captioner] 19:26:02
UNION CITY AND WILL CONNECT WITH 

[Captioner] 19:26:03
LINE 299 AT UNION CITY.

[Captioner] 19:26:06
SO IT'S JUST A CHANGE IN THE 

[Captioner] 19:26:08
NUMBER OF THE LINE, IT WILL STAY 

[Captioner] 19:26:09
THE SAME IN OTHER RESPECTS.

[Captioner] 19:26:14
SO JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT 

[Captioner] 19:26:15
I'M CLEAR ABOUT SOME OF THE 

[Captioner] 19:26:16
TRADEOFFS THAT ARE PROPOSED HERE 

[Captioner] 19:26:18
SO THAT WE CAN GET GOOD FEEDBACK 

[Captioner] 19:26:19
AND MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE MAKING 

[Captioner] 19:26:21
THE RIGHT DECISIONS WHEN WE 

[Captioner] 19:26:22
ULTIMATELY PUT A PLAN BEFORE OUR 

[Captioner] 19:26:24
BOARD, BUT REALIGN IS PROPOSING 

[Captioner] 19:26:25
TO INCREASE ALL LINES SERVING 

[Captioner] 19:26:27
FREMONT TO EVERY 30 MINUTES OR 

[Captioner] 19:26:30
BETTER ON WEEKDAYS AND ADD A 

[Captioner] 19:26:31
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF WEEKEND 

[Captioner] 19:26:32
SERVICE.

[Captioner] 19:26:33
IN ORDER TO FREE UP RESOURCES TO 

[Captioner] 19:26:36
DO THIS, SERVICE IS LOST IN SOME 

[Captioner] 19:26:37
PLACES SUCH AS OSGOOD AND 

[Captioner] 19:26:37
NILES.

[Captioner] 19:26:39
FINALLY, A NEW ON DEMAND ZONE IS 

[Captioner] 19:26:41
PROPOSED IN WARM SPRINGS TO TRY 

[Captioner] 19:26:42
OUT A NEW WAY TO PROVIDE 

[Captioner] 19:26:42
MOBILITY.

[Captioner] 19:26:46
SO HERE'S WHAT THOSE SCENARIOS 

[Captioner] 19:26:48
LOOK LIKE IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER 

[Captioner] 19:26:49
OF LINES IN EACH FREQUENCY 

[Captioner] 19:26:49
CATEGORY.

[Captioner] 19:26:51
SO ALONG THE LEFT WE HAVE NUMBER 

[Captioner] 19:26:53
OF LINES RUNNING 10 MINUTES OR 

[Captioner] 19:26:55
BETTER, NEXT ONE, 10 TO 15, 15 

[Captioner] 19:26:56
TO 30, ET CETERA.

[Captioner] 19:26:58
IN THE FREQUENT SCENARIO, THERE 

[Captioner] 19:26:59
ARE MORE LINES OPERATING EVERY 

[Captioner] 19:27:01
10 MINUTES AND NO LINES COMING 

[Captioner] 19:27:02
LESS OFTEN THAN EVERY 30 MINUTES 

[Captioner] 19:27:05
AND THIS IS SYSTEM-WIDE.

[Captioner] 19:27:09
THE BALANCED COVERAGE SCENARIO 

[Captioner] 19:27:12
EVERY 15 TO 30 MINUTES, THAN THE 

[Captioner] 19:27:12
CURRENT NETWORK.

[Captioner] 19:27:14
THERE'S A DROP IN LINES AS A 

[Captioner] 19:27:16
PRODUCT OF CONSOLIDATING SOME 

[Captioner] 19:27:18
LINES LIKE THE 215 AND EXTENDING 

[Captioner] 19:27:18
OTHERS.

[Captioner] 19:27:20
THESE NUMBERS ALSO ONLY REFLECT 

[Captioner] 19:27:22
INDIVIDUAL LINE HEADWAYS AND 

[Captioner] 19:27:23
FREQUENCIES AND NOT SITUATIONS 

[Captioner] 19:27:25
WHERE MULTIPLE LINES COMBINE FOR 

[Captioner] 19:27:29
A GREATER FREQUENCY.

[Captioner] 19:27:31
SO LET'S BRIEFLY FINISH WITH OUR 

[Captioner] 19:27:32
ENGAGEMENT ACTIVITIES.

[Captioner] 19:27:35
WE'RE IN PHASE THREE, PUBLIC 

[Captioner] 19:27:36
ENGAGEMENT, TO SUPPORT THE 

[Captioner] 19:27:38
REVIEW AND UPDATE OF OUR SERVICE 

[Captioner] 19:27:40
NETWORK, WHICH CONCLUDES ON 

[Captioner] 19:27:40
DECEMBER 13TH.

[Captioner] 19:27:42
WE'RE INTRODUCING BUS SERVICE 

[Captioner] 19:27:44
PROPOSALS AND ASKING PE PEOPLE 

[Captioner] 19:27:46
TO LEARN, REVIEW AND COMMENT ON 

[Captioner] 19:27:47

[Captioner] 19:27:48
THEIR VOICES CAN BE HEARD IN THE 

[Captioner] 19:27:48

[Captioner] 19:27:52

AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I'M 

[Captioner] 19:29:30
AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS.

[Captioner] 19:29:38
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU VERY 

[Captioner] 19:29:39
MUCH FOR THE PRESENTATION AND 

[Captioner] 19:29:40
FOR THE DETAILS.

[Captioner] 19:29:42
ALSO CONGRATULATIONS ON MANY OF 

[Captioner] 19:29:44
THE AWARDS THAT HAVE BEEN 

[Captioner] 19:29:46
BESTOWED UPON AC TRANSIT AND THE 

[Captioner] 19:29:46
EFFORTS.

[Captioner] 19:29:49
I KNOW ONE OF THE STUDENTS SPOKE 

[Captioner] 19:29:50
ABOUT ELECTRIFICATION, I KNOW 

[Captioner] 19:29:52
YOU'VE ALSO BEEN AWARDED SOME OF 

[Captioner] 19:29:53
THOSE GRANTS SPECIFICALLY AT THE 

[Captioner] 19:29:54
FEDERAL LEVEL, SO THAT'S 

[Captioner] 19:29:55
ADMIRABLE THAT WE'RE FOCUSING ON 

[Captioner] 19:29:55
THAT.

[Captioner] 19:29:58
WITH THAT, I WAS GOING TO SAY, 

[Captioner] 19:29:59
THIS TIME WE'LL ASK FOR 

[Captioner] 19:30:02
CLARIFYING QUESTIONS FROM -- OR 

[Captioner] 19:30:02
COMMENTS FROM COUNCIL.

[Captioner] 19:30:04
I SEE COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL.

[Captioner] 19:30:06
ALSO ARE THERE SPEAKER CARDS FOR 

[Captioner] 19:30:07
THIS, I THINK, TWO?

[Captioner] 19:30:08
>> Ms. Gauthier: FOUR AT THE 

[Captioner] 19:30:08
MOMENT.

[Captioner] 19:30:09
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY.

[Captioner] 19:30:10
COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL, 

[Captioner] 19:30:10
CLARIFYING QUESTIONS?

[Captioner] 19:30:12
THEN WE'LL GO TO THE SPEAKER 

[Captioner] 19:30:12
CARDS AND THEN COME BACK.

[Captioner] 19:30:14
>> Councilmember Campbell: OKAY, 

[Captioner] 19:30:14
THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 19:30:16
JUST ONE QUICK QUESTION -- WELL, 

[Captioner] 19:30:16
I'VE GOT TWO.

[Captioner] 19:30:20
CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHAT ON-DEMAND 

[Captioner] 19:30:22
RIDE MEANS?

[Captioner] 19:30:23
>> ABSOLUTELY.

[Captioner] 19:30:27
BEFORE THE PANDEMIC, WE HAD AC 

[Captioner] 19:30:29
TRANSIT FLEX, ONE IN NEWARK, ONE 

[Captioner] 19:30:29
IN CASTRO VALLEY.

[Captioner] 19:30:33
IT WAS SET UP AS A STOP-TO-STOP 

[Captioner] 19:30:34
SERVICE THAT HAD A SCHEDULED 

[Captioner] 19:30:37
TIME POINT AT A BART STATION.

[Captioner] 19:30:40
PEOPLE COULD RESERVE RIDES AND 

[Captioner] 19:30:41
INSTEAD OF FOLLOWING A ROUTE TO 

[Captioner] 19:30:42
GET A PRESCRIBED PUBLISHED ROUTE 

[Captioner] 19:30:44
TO GET TO THEM, WOULD GO THE 

[Captioner] 19:30:45
FASTEST WAY POSSIBLE TO GET TO 

[Captioner] 19:30:46
THOSE FOLKS AND THEN TAKE THEM 

[Captioner] 19:30:48
THE FASTEST WAY POSSIBLE TO GET 

[Captioner] 19:30:50
TO WHERE THEY WANTED TO BE 

[Captioner] 19:30:51
DROPPED OFF AND THEY COULD BE 

[Captioner] 19:30:52
DROPPED OFF AND PICKED UP AT ANY 

[Captioner] 19:30:54
BUS STOP IN THAT ZONE.

[Captioner] 19:30:55
THAT'S KIND OF ONE OF THE WAYS 

[Captioner] 19:30:57
THAT WE MIGHT PROVIDE SERVICE IN 

[Captioner] 19:31:01
THIS ZONE, AND THERE'S A 

[Captioner] 19:31:02
SPECTRUM FROM THAT ALL THE WAY 

[Captioner] 19:31:04
TO MAYBE IT'S JUST A SUBSIDY FOR 

[Captioner] 19:31:05
FOLKS TO USE SOME SORT OF 

[Captioner] 19:31:06
PRIVATE SERVICE.

[Captioner] 19:31:08
SO WE'RE STILL WORKING OUT 

[Captioner] 19:31:09
DETAILS ON EXACTLY WHAT THAT'S 

[Captioner] 19:31:09
GOING TO LOOK LIKE.

[Captioner] 19:31:10
>> Councilmember Campbell: BUT 

[Captioner] 19:31:12
WOULD IT HAVE TO BE RESERVED?

[Captioner] 19:31:14
THAT'S ONE OF THE KEY COMPONENTS 

[Captioner] 19:31:15
TO THE ON DEMAND SERVICE, IS IT 

[Captioner] 19:31:18
HAS TO BE RESERVED, OR IS IT A 

[Captioner] 19:31:19
SCHEDULED TIME?

[Captioner] 19:31:23
>> I'M USING RESERVED IN KIND OF 

[Captioner] 19:31:23
A LIGHT WAY.

[Captioner] 19:31:26
YOU HAVE TO GO ONLINE OR MAKE A 

[Captioner] 19:31:27
PHONE CALL AND YOU COULD RESERVE 

[Captioner] 19:31:28
IT UP TO 30 MINUTES IN ADVANCE.

[Captioner] 19:31:30
IT'S NOT LIKE DAYS BEFORE OR 

[Captioner] 19:31:30
ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

[Captioner] 19:31:32
OTHERWISE THE BUS WOULDN'T KNOW 

[Captioner] 19:31:33
THAT YOU'RE THERE, WOULDN'T KNOW 

[Captioner] 19:31:34
TO COME GET YOU.

[Captioner] 19:31:38
KIND OF LIKE AN UBER OR LYFT.

[Captioner] 19:31:39
>> Councilmember Campbell: 

[Captioner] 19:31:39
OKAY.

[Captioner] 19:31:44
AND ON SLIDE 16, YOU MENTIONED 

[Captioner] 19:31:49
LINE 216 WOULD BE MOVED UP TO 

[Captioner] 19:31:50
MISSION BOULEVARD.

[Captioner] 19:31:53
HOW FAR UP -- BECAUSE IT'S TAKEN 

[Captioner] 19:31:55
AWAY FROM ANY COVERAGE IN THE 

[Captioner] 19:31:55
NILES AREA?

[Captioner] 19:31:57
IS THAT WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE?

[Captioner] 19:31:57
>> YES.

[Captioner] 19:32:01
SO THE COVERAGE ON NILES THAT 

[Captioner] 19:32:02
THE 216 CURRENTLY PROVIDES, WE 

[Captioner] 19:32:04
FOUND THAT THE RIDERSHIP WAS 

[Captioner] 19:32:07
HIGHER WHERE THE 232 OPERATES ON 

[Captioner] 19:32:08
MISSION IN ORDER TO PROVIDE THIS 

[Captioner] 19:32:10
30 MINUTE NETWORK, WE COULDN'T 

[Captioner] 19:32:11
SERVE BOTH STREETS SO WE PICKED 

[Captioner] 19:32:11
THAT ONE.

[Captioner] 19:32:12
BUT THIS IS SOMETHING WE'RE 

[Captioner] 19:32:13
TRYING TO GET INPUT ON.

[Captioner] 19:32:15
SO IF THE THOUGHT IS THAT'S TOO 

[Captioner] 19:32:16
MUCH OF A TRADEOFF, WE CAN 

[Captioner] 19:32:17
FIGURE OUT A DIFFERENT 

[Captioner] 19:32:17
SOLUTION.

[Captioner] 19:32:19
>> Councilmember Campbell: WELL, 

[Captioner] 19:32:21
I GUESS IT WOULD CONCERN ME THAT 

[Captioner] 19:32:22
THEY WOULDN'T HAVE ANY BUS 

[Captioner] 19:32:23
SERVICE IN THAT AREA, AND THAT 

[Captioner] 19:32:27
MAY BE A LITTLE BIT CONCERNING 

[Captioner] 19:32:31
TO TRAVELERS WHO NEED THE TRANSIT.

[Captioner] 19:32:34
WHAT WOULD BE A TRADEOFF FOR 

[Captioner] 19:32:36
THAT THEN?

[Captioner] 19:32:38
>> THE TRADEOFF WOULD BE THAT 

[Captioner] 19:32:41
THE LINE OPERATING NEAR THEM, 

[Captioner] 19:32:42
THEY WOULD HAVE TO WALK FURTHER 

[Captioner] 19:32:44
BUT THE BUS WOULD BE COMING 

[Captioner] 19:32:45
TWICE AS OFTEN.

[Captioner] 19:32:46
IF THAT MAKES SENSE.

[Captioner] 19:32:50
>> Councilmember Campbell: SO IT 

[Captioner] 19:32:53
WOULD JUST BE A LONGER DISTANCE 

[Captioner] 19:32:54
TO GET TO THE STOP, BUT THERE 

[Captioner] 19:32:54
WOULD BE A STOP THERE?

[Captioner] 19:32:56
>> IT WOULD BE ON MISSION.

[Captioner] 19:32:58
>> Councilmember Campbell: ON 

[Captioner] 19:32:58
MISSION?

[Captioner] 19:32:58
>> YEAH.

[Captioner] 19:32:59
>> Councilmember Campbell: OH, 

[Captioner] 19:33:00
OKAY.

[Captioner] 19:33:01
THAT MIGHT BE PROBLEMATIC TOO.

[Captioner] 19:33:03
I'LL REACH OUT TO THE COMMUNITY 

[Captioner] 19:33:05
AND SEE HOW THEY FEEL ABOUT 

[Captioner] 19:33:05
THAT.

[Captioner] 19:33:06
>> AND WE'VE ALSO TALKED TO OUR 

[Captioner] 19:33:08
BUS OPERATORS ABOUT THAT ONE, 

[Captioner] 19:33:10
AND THEY SAID THAT TURN ON 

[Captioner] 19:33:11
NURSERY MIGHT BE A LITTLE 

[Captioner] 19:33:11
CHALLENGING WITH THE BUS.

[Captioner] 19:33:14
SO THERE MIGHT ALSO BE LIKE HARD 

[Captioner] 19:33:16
CONCERNS ABOUT LIKE MAKING A BUS 

[Captioner] 19:33:17
MOVE THROUGH AN AREA THAT WE 

[Captioner] 19:33:19
NEED TO TEST OUT, AND WE'RE 

[Captioner] 19:33:20
GOING TO BE DOING THAT.

[Captioner] 19:33:21
>> Councilmember Campbell: THANK 

[Captioner] 19:33:21
YOU.

[Captioner] 19:34:02
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.CLARIFYING QUESTIONS?COUNCILMEMBER COX.

[Captioner] 19:34:02
>> Vice Mayor Cox: I THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO HAVE THE PUBLIC SPEAK FIRST.

[Captioner] 19:34:02
I WAS GOING TO WAIT UNTIL AFTER THE PUBLIC SPOKE.>> Mayor Mei: SURE.

[Captioner] 19:34:02
I HAVE A COUPLE QUICK CLARIFYING QUESTIONS TOO.I WANTED TO ASK QUICKLY, WE HAVE 

[Captioner] 19:34:02
A COUPLE UNIQUE FACILITIES THAT ARE IN FREMONT AND I KNOW THAT YOU'VE PARTNERED WITH THEM IN 

[Captioner] 19:34:02
THE PAST, SUCH AS THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL FOR THE BLIND AND THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL FOR THE DEAF.

[Captioner] 19:34:02
AND ALSO FRIENDS OF CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL NEEDS ON THAT CORRIDOR.

[Captioner] 19:34:02
I'M A LITTLE CONCERNED BECAUSE IN LOOKING AT THE MAP, YOU'RE SAYING YOU'RE NOT GOOD TO HAVE 

[Captioner] 19:34:03
SERVICE ON 215 BETWEEN OSGOOD 

[Captioner] 19:34:04
AND WASHINGTON BOULEVARD, THAT 

[Captioner] 19:34:06
AREA, AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHERE 

[Captioner] 19:34:07
THEIR NEW CENTER IS GOING TO BE 

[Captioner] 19:34:09
TOO, SO I WAS JUST WONDERING, IS 

[Captioner] 19:34:10
THAT GOING TO BE A CONCERN?

[Captioner] 19:34:11
HAVE WE LOOKED INTO HOW WE'RE 

[Captioner] 19:34:12
GOING TO PROVIDE ACCESS?

[Captioner] 19:34:15
ESPECIALLY FOR US THAT'S A 

[Captioner] 19:34:16
TRANSIT-ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT 

[Captioner] 19:34:17
AREA FOR OSGOOD, SO WE'RE 

[Captioner] 19:34:19
PUTTING IN A LOT OF NEW HOUSING 

[Captioner] 19:34:21
UNITS, IF YOU GO DOWN THAT 

[Captioner] 19:34:22
STREET YOU'LL SEE QUITE A FEW.

[Captioner] 19:34:24
THAT WAS PART TO ADDRESS AT THAT 

[Captioner] 19:34:27
TIME THE IRVINGTON BART STATION 

[Captioner] 19:34:28
AND THAT HAS SINCE BEEN DELAYED 

[Captioner] 19:34:31
SO IT WOULD BE REALLY BAD IF WE 

[Captioner] 19:34:33
HAD TRANSIT-ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT 

[Captioner] 19:34:35
WITHOUT BART AND AC TRANSIT ON 

[Captioner] 19:34:37
THAT -- NO TRANSIT ON THE 

[Captioner] 19:34:38
TRANSIT-ORIENTED DEVELOP M.

[Captioner] 19:34:39
THAT'S WHY I JUST WANTED TO 

[Captioner] 19:34:40
POINT THAT OUT.

[Captioner] 19:34:44
>> WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THOSE 

[Captioner] 19:34:44
ORGANIZATIONS.

[Captioner] 19:34:46
I'LL DOUBLE-CHECK AND WE'LL MAKE 

[Captioner] 19:34:47
SURE WE GET BACK TO YOU TO MAKE 

[Captioner] 19:34:48
SURE THAT THEY'RE COVERED.

[Captioner] 19:34:49
MY UNDERSTANDING WAS THE PLAN 

[Captioner] 19:34:51
WOULDN'T WORK IF WE DIDN'T 

[Captioner] 19:34:51
PROVIDE THEM WITH ACCESS.

[Captioner] 19:34:54
SO THAT WAS A KEY THING WE 

[Captioner] 19:34:55
WANTED TO MAKE SURE WE 

[Captioner] 19:34:55
ACCOMPLISHED.

[Captioner] 19:34:56
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY.

[Captioner] 19:34:59
AND IF YOU CAN LOOK INTO THE 

[Captioner] 19:34:59
OSGOOD CORRIDOR.

[Captioner] 19:35:01
ALSO WHILE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT 

[Captioner] 19:35:03
EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS, ONE OF 

[Captioner] 19:35:05
THE OTHER REASONS I KNOW WHY 215 

[Captioner] 19:35:06
WAS REALLY POPULAR BEFORE IS 

[Captioner] 19:35:08
ALSO AT ONE POINT, I THINK THERE 

[Captioner] 19:35:09
WAS QUITE A FEW STUDENTS COMING 

[Captioner] 19:35:10
FROM BART TO THE OHLONE COLLEGE, 

[Captioner] 19:35:13
AND SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT 

[Captioner] 19:35:14
WE'VE ALSO TALKED TO THEM ABOUT 

[Captioner] 19:35:15
THEIR RIDERSHIP TO ENSURE THAT 

[Captioner] 19:35:18
WE ARE PROVIDING ACCESS.

[Captioner] 19:35:21
WE'RE TRYING TO BUILD A 

[Captioner] 19:35:22
HEALTHIER NEXT GENERATION AND IF 

[Captioner] 19:35:25
WE CAN DO MASS TRANSIT, THAT 

[Captioner] 19:35:26
WOULD BE REALLY POPULAR.

[Captioner] 19:35:28
YOU'VE DONE AN ADMIRABLE JOB IN 

[Captioner] 19:35:30
TERMS OF GETTING PEOPLE 

[Captioner] 19:35:31
RETURNING FROM COVID BUT WE CAN 

[Captioner] 19:35:32
ALWAYS DO MORE.

[Captioner] 19:35:34
FINALLY ALONG THAT SAME CORRIDOR 

[Captioner] 19:35:35
IS ALSO A LOT OF MANUFACTURERS.

[Captioner] 19:35:37
SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE 

[Captioner] 19:35:38
PEOPLE ULTIMATELY -- I HEAR SO 

[Captioner] 19:35:40
OFTEN ABOUT -- JUST A GOOD 

[Captioner] 19:35:41
EXAMPLE IS UNFORTUNATELY TESLA'S 

[Captioner] 19:35:43
PARKING LOT IS SO FULL, ALONG 

[Captioner] 19:35:44
WITH SO MANY OF THE OTHER 

[Captioner] 19:35:45
MANUFACTURERS ON THAT CORRIDOR, 

[Captioner] 19:35:47
AND IF THEY CAN COME OFF OF 

[Captioner] 19:35:48
BART, THEY WOULD LOVE TO, SO AS 

[Captioner] 19:35:50
LONG AS THERE'S OPPORTUNITY -- I 

[Captioner] 19:35:52
SAW IT WAS REROUTED A LITTLE BIT 

[Captioner] 19:35:53
AROUND KATO, BUT IF THERE'S 

[Captioner] 19:35:55
ANYTHING ELSE WE CAN DO IN THAT 

[Captioner] 19:35:56
AREA, I GUESS I WOULD LOVE TO 

[Captioner] 19:35:58
HEAR FROM THE PUBLIC TOO, BUT I 

[Captioner] 19:35:59
APPRECIATE THE THOUGHT PROCESS 

[Captioner] 19:36:01
AND ALSO THE FACT THAT YOU'RE 

[Captioner] 19:36:05
EXTENDING FLEX TO THAT MORE 

[Captioner] 19:36:06
DENSE INNOVATION DISTRICT, WARM 

[Captioner] 19:36:06
SPRINGS AREA.

[Captioner] 19:36:08
SO IF YOU COULD CALL THE 

[Captioner] 19:36:09
SPEAKERS, MS. GAUTHIER, AND THEN 

[Captioner] 19:36:11
WE'LL COME BACK TO THE COUNCIL 

[Captioner] 19:36:11
FOR OTHER COMMENTS.

[Captioner] 19:36:18
>> Ms. Gauthier: LISA DANZ 

[Captioner] 19:36:18
FOLLOWED BY DANIEL.

[Captioner] 19:36:21
>> GOOD EVENING.

[Captioner] 19:36:22
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

[Captioner] 19:36:23
MY NAME IS LISA DANZ AND I'M ONE 

[Captioner] 19:36:25
OF THE VOLUNTEER LEADERS WITH 

[Captioner] 19:36:26
FREMONT FOR EVERYONE AND I JUST 

[Captioner] 19:36:28
WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW THAT WE 

[Captioner] 19:36:29
FREMONT FOR EVERYONE SIGNED ON 

[Captioner] 19:36:31
TO A LETTER THAT WAS DISTRIBUTED 

[Captioner] 19:36:35
TO SEVERAL DIFFERENT GROUPS THAT 

[Captioner] 19:36:37
I DID MANAGE TO SUBMIT IN 

[Captioner] 19:36:39
WRITING BUT I'LL READ SOME 

[Captioner] 19:36:40
HIGHLIGHTS SO YOU'RE AWARE OF 

[Captioner] 19:36:41
THE POSITION THAT ONE OF YOUR 

[Captioner] 19:36:42
LOCAL GROUPS HAS TAKEN, 

[Captioner] 19:36:44
SPECIFICALLY WE FEEL THAT 

[Captioner] 19:36:45
REALIGN MUST IMPROVE WORKING 

[Captioner] 19:36:46
CONDITIONS AND INCREASE OPERATOR 

[Captioner] 19:36:48
HIRING AND AVAILABILITY, WHICH 

[Captioner] 19:36:50
CAN IMPROVE CONDITIONS BOTH FOR 

[Captioner] 19:36:51
PASSENGERS AS WELL AS WORKING 

[Captioner] 19:36:54
CONDITIONS FOR OPERATORS.

[Captioner] 19:36:56
BECAUSE SUFFICIENT RECOVERY TIME 

[Captioner] 19:36:57
MUST BE BUILT INTO THE SCHEDULES 

[Captioner] 19:36:58
TO ENSURE THE OPERATORS GET 

[Captioner] 19:36:59
THEIR BREAKS, WHICH WOULD ALSO 

[Captioner] 19:37:01
MAKE THE SCHEDULES MORE 

[Captioner] 19:37:01
RELIABLE.

[Captioner] 19:37:03
I CAN TELL YOU FROM MY OWN 

[Captioner] 19:37:05
PERSONAL EXPERIENCE THAT ONE OF 

[Captioner] 19:37:07
THE REASONS WHY I OFTEN DON'T 

[Captioner] 19:37:08
TAKE THE BUS IS BECAUSE I CAN'T 

[Captioner] 19:37:09
COUNT ON THE SCHEDULE, AND I 

[Captioner] 19:37:11
HAVE TO BUILD IN LIKE A HALF AN 

[Captioner] 19:37:13
HOUR OF BUFFER, WHICH I MIGHT AS 

[Captioner] 19:37:15
WELL RIDE MY BICYCLE AT THAT POINT.

[Captioner] 19:37:21
SECOND, THE VISIONARY NETWORK -- 

[Captioner] 19:37:21
HIGHER SERVICE LEVELS AND 

[Captioner] 19:37:23
WORKING CONDITIONS AND 

[Captioner] 19:37:25
RELIABILITY, SO AGAIN FOCUSED ON 

[Captioner] 19:37:25
WORKING CONDITIONS.

[Captioner] 19:37:27
AND THIRD, THE SERVICE PROPOSALS 

[Captioner] 19:37:30
MUST HAVE CLEAR METRICS TO ALLOW 

[Captioner] 19:37:31
RIDERS, WORKERS AND THE BOARD TO 

[Captioner] 19:37:32
COMPARE THEM.

[Captioner] 19:37:34
AND BECAUSE YOU KNOW, WITHOUT 

[Captioner] 19:37:36
THE DATA, WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE 

[Captioner] 19:37:37
ABLE TO MAKE THE DECISIONS.

[Captioner] 19:37:40
SO I THINK I WON'T TRY TO READ 

[Captioner] 19:37:41
THE WHOLE THING BUT I JUST 

[Captioner] 19:37:43
WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU 

[Captioner] 19:37:44
KNEW THAT THERE'S THAT POSITION 

[Captioner] 19:37:45
LETTER OUT THERE AND THAT WE'RE 

[Captioner] 19:37:45
ON IT.

[Captioner] 19:37:46
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

[Captioner] 19:37:48
>> Ms. Gauthier: THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 19:37:54
DANIEL, FOLLOWED BY GERSARA.

[Captioner] 19:38:00
>> HELLO AGAIN.

[Captioner] 19:38:04
SO I'M NOT A FREQUENT BUS USER.

[Captioner] 19:38:07
MOST OF THE TIME BECAUSE IT'S 

[Captioner] 19:38:08
FASTER TO RIDE A BIKE.

[Captioner] 19:38:13
EVEN IF THE BUS IS ON TIME, 

[Captioner] 19:38:14
BEING QUITE HONEST, AND THAT'S 

[Captioner] 19:38:17
JUST A SYMPTOM OF OUR 

[Captioner] 19:38:21
INFRASTRUCTURE, A SYMPTOM OF HOW 

[Captioner] 19:38:25
CAR-DEPENDENT OUR CITY IS, AND 

[Captioner] 19:38:31
JUST HOW OUR ROADS ARE BUILT AND 

[Captioner] 19:38:31
DESIGNED.

[Captioner] 19:38:34
SO I JUST WANTED TO ASK FOR THE 

[Captioner] 19:38:37
CITY COUNCIL TO THINK ABOUT WHAT 

[Captioner] 19:38:39
KIND OF NETWORK DO YOU WANT?

[Captioner] 19:38:41
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT SPECIFIC 

[Captioner] 19:38:43
LINES, SPECIFIC ROUTES, ANYTHING 

[Captioner] 19:38:47
LIKE THAT, BUT JUST ON A BROAD 

[Captioner] 19:38:50
SCALE, IS THIS WHAT YOUR VISION 

[Captioner] 19:38:51
IS?

[Captioner] 19:38:54
HOPEFULLY WE CAN DREAM A LITTLE 

[Captioner] 19:38:55
BIGGER, RIGHT?

[Captioner] 19:38:59
WE CAN LOOK AT WHAT UNION CITY 

[Captioner] 19:38:59
HAS DONE.

[Captioner] 19:39:01
THEY HAVE THEIR OWN, THEY 

[Captioner] 19:39:02
CONTROL IT, THEY DECIDE THOSE 

[Captioner] 19:39:05
ROUTES, THEY DECIDE THOSE 

[Captioner] 19:39:07
FREQUENCIES, AND YES, THAT TAKES 

[Captioner] 19:39:11
MONEY, RIGHT, BUT IF WE WANT TO 

[Captioner] 19:39:13
HAVE MORE PEOPLE RIDING THE BUS, 

[Captioner] 19:39:16
30 MINUTE FREQUENCIES IS ONLY 

[Captioner] 19:39:18
GOING TO ATTRACT THOSE WHO HAVE 

[Captioner] 19:39:22
NO BETTER CHOICE.

[Captioner] 19:39:27
JUST TO SHARE A QUOTE, A 

[Captioner] 19:39:28
DEVELOPED COUNTRY ISN'T ONE 

[Captioner] 19:39:31
WHERE THE POOR HAVE CARS, IT'S 

[Captioner] 19:39:33
WHERE THE RICH TAKE PUBLIC 

[Captioner] 19:39:33
TRANSPORTATION.

[Captioner] 19:39:36
WHEN WE FOCUS ON, YOU KNOW, X 

[Captioner] 19:39:38
HIGH PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE WHO 

[Captioner] 19:39:42
TAKE THE BUS ARE 

[Captioner] 19:39:43
TRANSIT-DEPENDENT, THAT'S NOT A 

[Captioner] 19:39:43
GOOD THING.

[Captioner] 19:39:45
IF WE SAY, OKAY, THIS SERVICE IS 

[Captioner] 19:39:47
SO BAD THAT YOU WOULD LITERALLY 

[Captioner] 19:39:48
TAKE ANYTHING ELSE EXCEPT TAKE 

[Captioner] 19:39:51
THE BUS, WELL, THEN YEAH, YOU'RE 

[Captioner] 19:39:52
GOING TO HAVE A HIGH PERCENTAGE 

[Captioner] 19:39:53
OF PEOPLE WHO TAKE THE BUS 

[Captioner] 19:39:55
BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO OTHER 

[Captioner] 19:39:55
CHOICE.

[Captioner] 19:39:59
BUT I THINK WE CAN AIM HIGHER, 

[Captioner] 19:40:04
WE CAN AIM FOR A NETWORK, FOR A 

[Captioner] 19:40:06
SERVICE THAT IS ACTUALLY 

[Captioner] 19:40:06
ATTRACTIVE.

[Captioner] 19:40:08
WHEN I GET OFF AT THE BART 

[Captioner] 19:40:10
STATION, SAY I GO TO THE CITY, 

[Captioner] 19:40:13
COME BACK, I WANT TO GET FROM 

[Captioner] 19:40:15
THE BART STATION TO MY HOUSE.

[Captioner] 19:40:19
I COULD TAKE THE BUS, BUT THAT'S 

[Captioner] 19:40:22
GOING TO ADD AT LEAST 10, 15 

[Captioner] 19:40:25
MINUTES TO A 10 OR 15-MINUTE 

[Captioner] 19:40:26
JOURNEY WHEN I CAN RIDE A BIKE 

[Captioner] 19:40:28
OR I CAN DRIVE TO THE BART 

[Captioner] 19:40:28
STATION.

[Captioner] 19:40:30
SO IF WE WANT TO INCREASE 

[Captioner] 19:40:31
RIDERSHIP, WHICH WOULD INCREASE 

[Captioner] 19:40:33
-- WHICH WOULD TAKE CARS OFF THE 

[Captioner] 19:40:34
ROAD, WHICH WOULD INCREASE 

[Captioner] 19:40:37
SAFETY, WHICH WOULD DECREASE OUR 

[Captioner] 19:40:39
MISSIONS, ALL OF WHICH ALIGNS 

[Captioner] 19:40:40
WITH THE CITY'S GOALS, WE REALLY 

[Captioner] 19:40:44
NEED TO THINK ABOUT A NETWORK 

[Captioner] 19:40:45
THAT ACTUALLY ATTRACTS PEOPLE 

[Captioner] 19:40:46
WHO DO HAVE ANOTHER CHOICE.

[Captioner] 19:40:51
AND SERVE EVERYONE, NOT JUST 

[Captioner] 19:40:52
FOCUSING ON THE PEOPLE WHO NEED 

[Captioner] 19:40:54
IT, WE CAN FOCUS ON EVERYONE, OR 

[Captioner] 19:40:55
AT LEAST WE SHOULD STRIVE TO.

[Captioner] 19:40:55
THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 19:41:04
>> Ms. Gauthier: GERSERAT.

[Captioner] 19:41:09
FOLLOWED BY PROBLINE.

[Captioner] 19:41:11
>> HI.

[Captioner] 19:41:13
I'M A SENIOR AT AMERICAN HIGH 

[Captioner] 19:41:14
SCHOOL, AND I WOULD JUST LIKE TO 

[Captioner] 19:41:16
GIVE A COMMENT ON THE AC TRANSIT 

[Captioner] 19:41:16
ITEM.

[Captioner] 19:41:19
THE SLIDE SHOW CLAIMED THAT 

[Captioner] 19:41:20
THERE ARE 30,000 STUDENT TRIPS 

[Captioner] 19:41:23
TO AND FROM EVERY SCHOOL DAY AND 

[Captioner] 19:41:25
I THINK THAT IS SOMETHING TO 

[Captioner] 19:41:25
COMMEND.

[Captioner] 19:41:27
I PERSONALLY DON'T USE THE AC 

[Captioner] 19:41:30
TRANSIT, BUT I SEE A LOT OF MY 

[Captioner] 19:41:32
PEERS USE IT AND I THINK IT HAS 

[Captioner] 19:41:33
MADE AFTER-SCHOOL TRANSPORTATION 

[Captioner] 19:41:34
REALLY CONVENIENT FOR THEM.

[Captioner] 19:41:36
AND I WOULD ASK YOU TO CONTINUE 

[Captioner] 19:41:38
YOUR EFFORTS IN MAKING THIS 

[Captioner] 19:41:39
POSSIBLE AND EVEN MORE 

[Captioner] 19:41:39
CONVENIENT.

[Captioner] 19:41:40
THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 19:41:44
>> Ms. Gauthier: THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 19:41:46
THE LAST SPEAKER IS PROBLINE.

[Captioner] 19:41:53
>> HI.

[Captioner] 19:41:55
I'M ALSO A SENIOR AT AMERICAN 

[Captioner] 19:41:56
HIGH SCHOOL.

[Captioner] 19:42:00
AND I'VE OBSERVED SOME 

[Captioner] 19:42:02
CLEANLINESS ISSUES ON CERTAIN AC 

[Captioner] 19:42:03
TRANSIT BUSES THAT I'VE USED.

[Captioner] 19:42:06
CLEANLINESS IS CRUCIAL FOR THE 

[Captioner] 19:42:07
COMFORT AND WELL-BEING OF 

[Captioner] 19:42:08
PASSENGERS AND A CLEANER 

[Captioner] 19:42:09
ENVIRONMENT WOULD FOR SURE 

[Captioner] 19:42:11
ENHANCE THE OVERALL EXPERIENCE 

[Captioner] 19:42:13
FOR RIDERS SO I JUST WANTED TO 

[Captioner] 19:42:13
SUGGEST THAT.

[Captioner] 19:42:13
THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 19:42:20
>> Mayor Mei: THAT WAS THE LAST 

[Captioner] 19:42:21
OF OUR SPEAKERS?

[Captioner] 19:42:22
THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 19:42:23
COUNCILMEMBER COX.

[Captioner] 19:42:27
>> Vice Mayor Cox: THANK YOU, 

[Captioner] 19:42:28
MADAME MAYOR.

[Captioner] 19:42:29
I HAD A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS.

[Captioner] 19:42:33
I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR 

[Captioner] 19:42:33
PRESENTATION.

[Captioner] 19:42:36
I WANTED TO ASK YOU, WITH THE 

[Captioner] 19:42:40
30,000 STUDENTS, WHICH IS OUR 

[Captioner] 19:42:42
PRECIOUS FUTURE, IS THERE -- ARE 

[Captioner] 19:42:43
YOU SAYING 30,000 JUST IN 

[Captioner] 19:42:46
GENERAL OF YOUR WHOLE SERVICE 

[Captioner] 19:42:47
AREA?

[Captioner] 19:42:52
ALAMEDA COUNTY OR SANTA CLARA 

[Captioner] 19:42:52
COUNTY?

[Captioner] 19:42:54
I JUST NEEDED TO HAVE A LITTLE 

[Captioner] 19:42:54
CLARIFICATION ON THAT.

[Captioner] 19:42:56
>> IT'S THE WHOLE COUNTY AND 

[Captioner] 19:42:58
IT'S ANY AC TRANSIT BUS THAT 

[Captioner] 19:42:58
OPERATES IN THE COUNTY.

[Captioner] 19:43:01
SOME OF THEM GO INTO MILIPITAS.

[Captioner] 19:43:03
>> Vice Mayor Cox: AND IS 

[Captioner] 19:43:05
MILIPITAS THE MOST SOUTHERN PART 

[Captioner] 19:43:07
OF WHERE YOUR SERVICE AREA IS, 

[Captioner] 19:43:10
AND THEN THAT'S WHERE VTA WOULD 

[Captioner] 19:43:13
KICK IN AT THE EXCHANGE OF THE 

[Captioner] 19:43:15
MILIPITAS BART STATION; IS THAT 

[Captioner] 19:43:15
CORRECT?

[Captioner] 19:43:16
>> THAT'S CORRECT, YEAH.

[Captioner] 19:43:17
>> Vice Mayor Cox: OKAY, 

[Captioner] 19:43:17
GOTCHA.

[Captioner] 19:43:22
I WANTED TO FIND OUT ALSO WITH 

[Captioner] 19:43:23
THE -- GOING ALONG THE LIEPS OF 

[Captioner] 19:43:25
GRIMMER AND AUTOMALL INTO OUR 

[Captioner] 19:43:27
IRVINGTON AREA, LOOKING STRAIGHT 

[Captioner] 19:43:30
OUT, ARE THERE ANY MAJOR CHANGES 

[Captioner] 19:43:34
WITH THE ROUTES THERE ON THAT 

[Captioner] 19:43:34
PART?

[Captioner] 19:43:38
>> THERE'S A LITTLE BIT -- THAT 

[Captioner] 19:43:39
INTERSECTION WILL STILL HAVE THE 

[Captioner] 19:43:41
SERVICE IT HAS TODAY AND IT WILL 

[Captioner] 19:43:41
COME FOR FREQUENTLY.

[Captioner] 19:43:43
THE MAIN ISSUE THAT WE WERE 

[Captioner] 19:43:45
TALKING ABOUT EARLIER IS, I 

[Captioner] 19:43:47
GUESS NORTHWEST OF AUTOMALL 

[Captioner] 19:43:48
BETWEEN -- ON OSGOOD BETWEEN 

[Captioner] 19:43:50
WASHINGTON AND AUTOMALL.

[Captioner] 19:43:52
BUT THERE STILL WILL BE SERVICE 

[Captioner] 19:43:54
IN THE AREA WHERE YOU'RE TALKING 

[Captioner] 19:43:55
ABOUT, JUST NOT ON THE OSGOOD 

[Captioner] 19:43:55
PART OF IT.

[Captioner] 19:43:57
>> Vice Mayor Cox: ABSOLUTELY.

[Captioner] 19:43:58
AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THE 

[Captioner] 19:44:00
SPEAKERS AS WELL IN PROVIDING 

[Captioner] 19:44:00
THEIR INPUT.

[Captioner] 19:44:02
ONE OF THE THINGS I WANTED TO 

[Captioner] 19:44:07
ASK WAS IN TERMS OF BESIDES 

[Captioner] 19:44:09
ELECTRIFICATION OF THE BUSES, 

[Captioner] 19:44:11
CAN YOU EXPLAIN A LITTLE BIT 

[Captioner] 19:44:13
MORE ABOUT THE AIR FILTER AND 

[Captioner] 19:44:17
THE BREATHING THAT FILTERS -- IS 

[Captioner] 19:44:18
THERE ANYTHING YOU COULD SHARE 

[Captioner] 19:44:21
ON THAT ASPECT OF IT?

[Captioner] 19:44:24
>> AT A VERY --

[Captioner] 19:44:25
>> Vice Mayor Cox: 

[Captioner] 19:44:26
FILTERRIZATION, AIR FILTERS.

[Captioner] 19:44:28
>> AT A VERY HIGH LEVEL, AT THE 

[Captioner] 19:44:30
BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC, WE 

[Captioner] 19:44:31
UPGRADED OUR AIR FILTERS IN OUR 

[Captioner] 19:44:33
VEHICLES AND WE ALSO PERFORMED 

[Captioner] 19:44:38
TESTS TO SEE HOWL PARTICLES 

[Captioner] 19:44:43
WOULD FLOW THROUGH THE BUS AND 

[Captioner] 19:44:45
MADE DECISIONS ABOUT WINDOWS 

[Captioner] 19:44:46
DOWN, WINDOWS UP, HOW THE AIR 

[Captioner] 19:44:50
FILTERS ARE WORKING, HOW THEY'RE 

[Captioner] 19:44:50
OPERATING.

[Captioner] 19:44:54
I CAN PUT THE QUESTION TO OUR 

[Captioner] 19:44:55
MAINTENANCE TEAM AND HAVE THEM 

[Captioner] 19:44:57
GO AHEAD AND PROVIDE A RESPONSE 

[Captioner] 19:44:58
BACK TO THE COUNCIL.

[Captioner] 19:44:59
>> Vice Mayor Cox: IT WOULD BE 

[Captioner] 19:45:02
GREAT, AND ALSO IF THEY COULD 

[Captioner] 19:45:03
SPELL OUT IF THERE WAS ANY TYPE 

[Captioner] 19:45:06
OF, I GUESS, THE TYPE OF 

[Captioner] 19:45:09
FILTERRIZATION AND WHAT THE 

[Captioner] 19:45:11
PERCENTAGE, WHETHER IT'S 80 OR 

[Captioner] 19:45:16
90, 95% OF REMOVING THE 

[Captioner] 19:45:17
CONTAMINANTS IN THE AIR, THAT 

[Captioner] 19:45:18
WOULD BE GREAT TO UNDERSTAND 

[Captioner] 19:45:20
THAT PIECE.

[Captioner] 19:45:24
ESPECIALLY AS YOU'RE EXPLAINING 

[Captioner] 19:45:25
TO OUR YOUTH AND FAMILY 

[Captioner] 19:45:26
MEMBERS.

[Captioner] 19:45:32
ANOTHER PART I WAS GOING TO AS 

[Captioner] 19:45:35
WAS, IN TERMS OF -- WE'VE SEEN A 

[Captioner] 19:45:39
LOT WITH OUR AREAS OF THE UAW 

[Captioner] 19:45:42
AND OUR AUTOMOBILE WORKERS GOING 

[Captioner] 19:45:44
ON STRIKE.

[Captioner] 19:45:48
WITH THE BUS SHORTAGES, BUS 

[Captioner] 19:45:54
DRIVER SHORTAGES, IS THERE -- 

[Captioner] 19:45:55
HOW ARE YOU ADDRESSING MAKING 

[Captioner] 19:45:56
SURE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE MORE 

[Captioner] 19:45:58
STEADY FLOW OF THOSE EMPLOYED, 

[Captioner] 19:46:00
BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE IN THAT 

[Captioner] 19:46:05
INDUSTRY OF TRUCKING AND IN THE 

[Captioner] 19:46:06
TRANSPORTATION ARENA, THERE 

[Captioner] 19:46:10
SEEMS TO BE A LITTLE UNSTABLE 

[Captioner] 19:46:12
LINES OF EMPLOYMENT FOR THOSE 

[Captioner] 19:46:13
THAT CARRY THE MOST PRECIOUS OF 

[Captioner] 19:46:15
ALL OF OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS.

[Captioner] 19:46:19
>> YEAH, THE HIRING AND 

[Captioner] 19:46:20
RETENTION HAS BEEN A CHALLENGE.

[Captioner] 19:46:23
DRIVING A BUS IS A DIFFICULT 

[Captioner] 19:46:23
JOB.

[Captioner] 19:46:25
WE DO HAVE A NUMBER OF THINGS IN 

[Captioner] 19:46:25
OUR FAVOR.

[Captioner] 19:46:27
FOR ONE, WE HAVE A PENSION.

[Captioner] 19:46:28
IT'S OUTSTANDING.

[Captioner] 19:46:31
I THINK A LOT OF FOLKS HAVE -- 

[Captioner] 19:46:33
IT'S DIFFICULT TO EXPLAIN A 

[Captioner] 19:46:35
PENSION TO A WORLD THAT DOESN'T 

[Captioner] 19:46:37
HAVE A LOT OF PENSIONS AROUND 

[Captioner] 19:46:38
ANYMORE, SO THE SHEER VALUE OF A 

[Captioner] 19:46:39
PENSION IS A LITTLE BIT 

[Captioner] 19:46:40
DIFFICULT TO COMMUNICATE.

[Captioner] 19:46:46
WE ALSO HAVE HIRING BONUSES, 

[Captioner] 19:46:46
RETENTION BONUSES.

[Captioner] 19:46:48
WE'VE BEEN WORKING ACTIVELY IN 

[Captioner] 19:46:50
THE COMMUNITY TO TRY TO IDENTIFY 

[Captioner] 19:46:52
MARKETS WHERE WE CAN HIRE MORE 

[Captioner] 19:46:56
EFFECTIVELY AND WE'VE ALSO 

[Captioner] 19:46:57
ENGAGED THE ENTIRE ORGANIZATION 

[Captioner] 19:46:59
IN A SERVICE RELIABILITY TASK 

[Captioner] 19:47:01
FORCE WHERE WE'RE WORKING TO 

[Captioner] 19:47:02
IDENTIFY SOME OF THE WEAK SPOTS, 

[Captioner] 19:47:03
THINGS THAT ARE LEADING TO A 

[Captioner] 19:47:05
LACK OF RETENTION OR TO A HIGHER 

[Captioner] 19:47:07
TURNOVER AMONG OUR FRONT-LINE 

[Captioner] 19:47:10
OPERATORS AND TAKING STEPS, SOME 

[Captioner] 19:47:11
AS SIMPLE AS MAKING SURE WE HAVE 

[Captioner] 19:47:12
HIGH QUALITY RESTROOMS AT THE 

[Captioner] 19:47:14
END OF THE LINE, ALL THE WAY UP 

[Captioner] 19:47:16
TO OTHER WORKING CONDITIONS AT 

[Captioner] 19:47:17
THE DIVISION, UPGRADING OUR 

[Captioner] 19:47:19
DIVISION AND MAKING SURE THAT 

[Captioner] 19:47:22
FROM HARD THINGS LIKE THOSE AS 

[Captioner] 19:47:24
IN LITERAL TANGIBLE THINGS LIKE 

[Captioner] 19:47:25
THOSE TO OTHER THINGS THAT ARE 

[Captioner] 19:47:27
LIKE WORKPLACE CULTURE AND 

[Captioner] 19:47:28
FEELING VALUED AND ALL THOSE 

[Captioner] 19:47:29
THINGS THAT REALLY MAKE YOU WANT 

[Captioner] 19:47:31
TO COME TO WORK EVERY DAY, THOSE 

[Captioner] 19:47:33
ARE ALL THINGS WE'RE WORKING 

[Captioner] 19:47:34
HOLISTICALLY AS AN ORGANIZATION 

[Captioner] 19:47:35
TO TRY TO MAKE SURE WE'RE 

[Captioner] 19:47:36
IMPROVING RETENTION.

[Captioner] 19:47:37
AS FAR AS MARKET CONDITIONS THAT 

[Captioner] 19:47:39
WOULD LEAD TO MORE OPERATOR 

[Captioner] 19:47:41
EMPLOYMENT, WHAT WE FOUND 

[Captioner] 19:47:42
HISTORICALLY IS THAT IN A 

[Captioner] 19:47:45
REALLY, REALLY TIGHT LABOR 

[Captioner] 19:47:48
MARKET, IT CAN BE CHALLENGING TO 

[Captioner] 19:47:49
HIRE BUS OPERATORS.

[Captioner] 19:47:53
AND THAT IF THE JOB MARKET 

[Captioner] 19:47:54
SOFTENS A LITTLE BIT, THEN IT 

[Captioner] 19:47:56
BECOMES A LITTLE EASIER TO HIRE 

[Captioner] 19:47:57
BUS OPERATORS AND ONCE THEY'RE 

[Captioner] 19:47:58
IN THE DOOR FOR MORE THAN A 

[Captioner] 19:48:00
YEAR, THE RETENTION RATES 

[Captioner] 19:48:01
INCREASE DRAMATICALLY.

[Captioner] 19:48:03
>> Vice Mayor Cox: THAT'S GOOD 

[Captioner] 19:48:04
TO KNOW.

[Captioner] 19:48:06
I HAD ANOTHER QUESTION IN TERMS 

[Captioner] 19:48:09
OF HOW EARLY DOES YOUR SERVICE 

[Captioner] 19:48:11
START AND HOW LATE, JUST ON 

[Captioner] 19:48:13
AVERAGE, OF ALL THE ROUTES THAT 

[Captioner] 19:48:14
YOU'RE REALIGNING JUST TO KIND 

[Captioner] 19:48:18
OF GET A RANGE OF YOUR SERVICE 

[Captioner] 19:48:18
TIMES.

[Captioner] 19:48:21
>> SO WE'RE A 24-HOUR SERVICE ON 

[Captioner] 19:48:22
A HANDFUL OF LINES.

[Captioner] 19:48:23
I WOULD SAY IN GENERAL, THE 

[Captioner] 19:48:26
AVERAGE IS ABOUT SIX TO 6:30 FOR 

[Captioner] 19:48:27
WHEN OUR LINES TURN ON IN THE 

[Captioner] 19:48:29
MORNING IN MOST PLACES.

[Captioner] 19:48:32
IN 2016, WE STRIVE TO MAKE SURE 

[Captioner] 19:48:34
THAT AS MANY LINES AS POSSIBLE 

[Captioner] 19:48:36
ON WEEKDAYS, WE'RE OPERATING 

[Captioner] 19:48:39
FROM 5:00 OR 6:00 A.M. UNTIL AT 

[Captioner] 19:48:39
LEAST 10:00 P.M.

[Captioner] 19:48:40
IN FREMONT, I WOULD SAY THE 

[Captioner] 19:48:42
SERVICE SPAN IS A LITTLE BIT 

[Captioner] 19:48:44
CLOSER TO 6:30 OR 7:00 A.M. IN 

[Captioner] 19:48:47
THE MORNING TO ABOUT 8:00 OR 

[Captioner] 19:48:47
9:00 P.M. AT NIGHT.

[Captioner] 19:48:48
IT'S A LITTLE BIT -- THE SPAN IS 

[Captioner] 19:48:50
A LITTLE BIT SHORTER IN FREMONT 

[Captioner] 19:48:52
THAN IT IS IN PARTS OF THE REST 

[Captioner] 19:48:53
OF THE NETWORK.

[Captioner] 19:48:53
>> Vice Mayor Cox: OKAY.

[Captioner] 19:48:55
THAT'S GOOD TO KNOW.

[Captioner] 19:48:59
AND ADDITIONALLY, I KNOW IT'S 

[Captioner] 19:49:01
BEEN TALKED, BUT I USED TO SERVE 

[Captioner] 19:49:03
ON THE OHLONE COLLEGE BOARD, AND 

[Captioner] 19:49:07
THEY HAVE A VERY ACTIVE PONY 

[Captioner] 19:49:08
SHUTTLE THAT GOES BETWEEN OUR 

[Captioner] 19:49:10
TWO CAMPUSES OF NEWARK AND 

[Captioner] 19:49:10
FREMONT.

[Captioner] 19:49:14
AND PROBABLY BEING ABLE TO SIT 

[Captioner] 19:49:17
DOWN AND TALK WITH -- TO ANY ONE 

[Captioner] 19:49:19
OF THE BOARD MEETINGS BUT ALSO 

[Captioner] 19:49:23
THEY HAVE THE STUDENT SENATE 

[Captioner] 19:49:25
MEETINGS, AND GETTING THEIR 

[Captioner] 19:49:29
INPUT IN TERMS OF NOT TO 

[Captioner] 19:49:30
DUPLICATE SOME OF THE PONY 

[Captioner] 19:49:31
SHUTTLING SERVICES BETWEEN THE 

[Captioner] 19:49:35
TWO CAMPUSES, WHICH IS AN 

[Captioner] 19:49:36
ELECTRIFIED VEHICLE AS WELL, BUT 

[Captioner] 19:49:37
ALSO KIND OF UNDERSTANDING WHERE 

[Captioner] 19:49:40
THERE CAN BE THE GAPS AS YOU'RE 

[Captioner] 19:49:43
REALIGNING IT, AND ALSO PLEASE 

[Captioner] 19:49:46
ALSO WORK WITH OUR PARTNER, 

[Captioner] 19:49:48
COMMUNITY PARTNER, THE FREMONT 

[Captioner] 19:49:50
UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT AS WELL 

[Captioner] 19:49:55
TO GET THEIR INPUT IN TERMS OF 

[Captioner] 19:49:55
THESE PLANS AS WELL.

[Captioner] 19:49:56
I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU COMING 

[Captioner] 19:49:59
OUT TO REACH OUT TO ALL OF US TO 

[Captioner] 19:50:01
MAKE SURE THAT OUR VOICES ARE 

[Captioner] 19:50:01
BEING HEARD.

[Captioner] 19:50:04
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

[Captioner] 19:50:06
>> THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 19:50:12
>> Mayor Mei: NEXT, CLARIFYING 

[Captioner] 19:50:14
QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS, VICE 

[Captioner] 19:50:14
MAYOR SHAO.

[Captioner] 19:50:16
>> Councilmember Shao: THANK 

[Captioner] 19:50:16
YOU, MADAME MAYOR.

[Captioner] 19:50:17
THIS IS JUST A COMMENT.

[Captioner] 19:50:24
I LEARNED FROM YOUR RECENT TOWN 

[Captioner] 19:50:25
MEETING OF FREMONT RESIDENTS 

[Captioner] 19:50:29
THAT YOU HAVE DONE A SOLID STUDY 

[Captioner] 19:50:29
WITH STANFORD UNIVERSITY AND 

[Captioner] 19:50:32
LEARNED THAT INSTEAD OF USING 

[Captioner] 19:50:34
ELECTRICITY, YOU ARE GOING TO 

[Captioner] 19:50:38
USE HYDROGEN AS THE NEW CLEAN 

[Captioner] 19:50:42
ENERGY, WHICH OF COURSE HAS NO 

[Captioner] 19:50:45
CARBON EMISSION, JUST GENERATE 

[Captioner] 19:50:49
WATER FROM MY BACKGROUND OF 

[Captioner] 19:50:52
CHEMISTRY, SO I REALLY COMMEND 

[Captioner] 19:50:55
YOU ON THAT SOLID WORK.

[Captioner] 19:50:59
BECAUSE IT'S NOT ABOUT POLITICAL 

[Captioner] 19:51:03
CORRECTNESS OR JUST TREND, 

[Captioner] 19:51:06
RATHER YOU BUILD A SOLID 

[Captioner] 19:51:07
FOUNDATION ON SCIENTIFIC DATA 

[Captioner] 19:51:11
AND THEN TRY TO REALLY FIND OUT 

[Captioner] 19:51:14
IN TERMS OF CAUSE EFFECTIVENESS 

[Captioner] 19:51:15
USING HYDROGEN ACTUALLY PROVES 

[Captioner] 19:51:19
TO BE MUCH, MUCH BETTER THAN 

[Captioner] 19:51:19
ELECTRICITY.

[Captioner] 19:51:23
I LOOK FORWARD TO MORE DATA FROM 

[Captioner] 19:51:24
YOUR CURRENT OPERATION AND ALSO 

[Captioner] 19:51:27
I WONDER IF YOU CAN SOMEHOW 

[Captioner] 19:51:31
PUBLISH OR SHARE YOUR FINDINGS 

[Captioner] 19:51:36
WITH AT LEAST NEIGHBORING 

[Captioner] 19:51:37
ORGANIZATIONS IN THE BAY AREA OR 

[Captioner] 19:51:38
EVEN IN CALIFORNIA SINCE YOU'RE 

[Captioner] 19:51:46
THE BIGGEST ORGANIZATION OF SUCH 

[Captioner] 19:51:50
SO THAT NOT ONLY YOUR DATA, YOUR 

[Captioner] 19:51:54
STUDIES CAN BENEFIT CALIFORNIA 

[Captioner] 19:51:56
OR EVEN OTHER STATES OR OTHER 

[Captioner] 19:51:56
COUNTRIES.

[Captioner] 19:51:59
>> WE PUBLISHED MOST OF 

[Captioner] 19:52:02
EVERYTHING THAT'S FINAL, SO ON 

[Captioner] 19:52:04
OUR WEBSITE WE HAVE A ZERO 

[Captioner] 19:52:06
EMISSION BUS PROGRAM SECTION AND 

[Captioner] 19:52:08
EVERY SIX MONTHS, WE PUBLISH 

[Captioner] 19:52:11
UPDATED STATISTICS ON HOW ALL OF 

[Captioner] 19:52:12
OUR ZERO EMISSION BUSES ARE 

[Captioner] 19:52:13
OPERATING AND HOW THEY COMPARE 

[Captioner] 19:52:13
TO EACH OTHER.

[Captioner] 19:52:17
SO WE HAVE DIESELS, HYBRIDS, OLD 

[Captioner] 19:52:20
FUEL CELLS, NEW FUEL CELLS AND 

[Captioner] 19:52:21
ELECTRIC BUSES, AND JUST ONE OF 

[Captioner] 19:52:22
THE THINGS WE FOUND AND THE 

[Captioner] 19:52:24
REASON FOR MORE OF AN EMPHASIS 

[Captioner] 19:52:26
ON THE FUEL CELLS IS THAT THEY 

[Captioner] 19:52:27
MEET OUR RANGE REQUIREMENTS.

[Captioner] 19:52:29
THE ZERO EMISSION ELECTRIC BUSES 

[Captioner] 19:52:30
THAT WE HAVE IN THE FLEET TODAY 

[Captioner] 19:52:34
ARE HAVING TROUBLE MEETING OUR 

[Captioner] 19:52:35
DAILY MILEAGE REQUIREMENTS THAT 

[Captioner] 19:52:36
THE HYDROGEN BUSES CAN EASILY 

[Captioner] 19:52:36
MEET.

[Captioner] 19:52:45
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 19:52:48
AT THIS TIME, CLARIFYING 

[Captioner] 19:52:49
QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS, 

[Captioner] 19:52:50
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN.

[Captioner] 19:52:51
>> Councilmember Salwan: THANK 

[Captioner] 19:52:55
YOU, MADAME MAYOR AND THANK YOU, 

[Captioner] 19:52:56
MR. ESHLEMAN FOR YOUR 

[Captioner] 19:52:56
PRESENTATION.

[Captioner] 19:52:58
NET PERCENTAGE REDUCTION, WHAT 

[Captioner] 19:52:59
WOULD YOU ESTIMATE IN FREMONT?

[Captioner] 19:53:01
>> SO FREMONT IS ACTUALLY RETURN 

[Captioner] 19:53:01
TO SOURCE.

[Captioner] 19:53:03
SO THE SAME NUMBER OF SERVICE 

[Captioner] 19:53:05
HOURS THAT WE'RE PROVIDING IN 

[Captioner] 19:53:06
FREMONT TODAY WILL BE PROVIDING 

[Captioner] 19:53:08
UNDER THIS NEW PLAN, IT'S JUST 

[Captioner] 19:53:09
ALLOCATING THEM DIFFERENTLY 

[Captioner] 19:53:11
WITHIN THE CONFINES OF WHAT WE 

[Captioner] 19:53:13
CALL SPECIAL DISTRICT 2, WHICH 

[Captioner] 19:53:14
IS A SUBSET OF OUR OVERALL 

[Captioner] 19:53:14
DISTRICT.

[Captioner] 19:53:18
>> Councilmember Salwan: SO HIGH 

[Captioner] 19:53:20
LEVEL, YOU'RE INCREASING 

[Captioner] 19:53:21
RIDERSHIP IN AREAS THAT ARE MORE 

[Captioner] 19:53:23
FREQUENTLY VISITED AND CUTTING 

[Captioner] 19:53:25
DOWN AREAS THAT ARE NOT -- 

[Captioner] 19:53:27
PEOPLE DON'T USE THE RIDERSHIP?

[Captioner] 19:53:27
>> THAT'S THE GOAL.

[Captioner] 19:53:29
WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT 

[Captioner] 19:53:31
WE'RE CREATING A NETWORK WHERE 

[Captioner] 19:53:33
PEOPLE HAVE EVERY LINE COMES AT 

[Captioner] 19:53:34
LEAST EVERY 30 MINUTES AND WHERE 

[Captioner] 19:53:36
THEY OVERLAP, YOU HAVE A BUS 

[Captioner] 19:53:36
EVERY 15.

[Captioner] 19:53:39
AND THEY MIGHT SPLIT OFF AT SOME 

[Captioner] 19:53:41
POINT, ONE GOES TO OHLONE, ONE 

[Captioner] 19:53:42
GOES TO BART, ET CETERA, ET 

[Captioner] 19:53:42
CETERA.

[Captioner] 19:53:43
>> Councilmember Salwan: GREAT.

[Captioner] 19:53:45
THANKS FOR COMING HERE AND GOING 

[Captioner] 19:53:45
OVER THIS.

[Captioner] 19:53:47
TRANSIT IS ONE OF THOSE THINGS, 

[Captioner] 19:53:49
IT LIKE THE CHICKEN OR THE EGG, 

[Captioner] 19:53:50
YOU KNOW, WE WANT EVERYBODY TO 

[Captioner] 19:53:52
USE TRANSIT, THEN TRANSIT HAS 

[Captioner] 19:53:54
GOT TO BE AVAILABLE FREQUENTLY, 

[Captioner] 19:53:56
IT'S GOT TO BE EASILY ACCESSIBLE 

[Captioner] 19:53:58
AND RELATIVELY LOW FRICTION.

[Captioner] 19:54:02
SO I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF 

[Captioner] 19:54:04
CHALLENGES IN TRANSIT IN 

[Captioner] 19:54:05
GENERAL, ESPECIALLY RIGHT NOW, 

[Captioner] 19:54:06
BUT I THINK THE BIGGEST 

[Captioner] 19:54:07
CHALLENGE IS JUST FOR ALL THE 

[Captioner] 19:54:07
SYSTEMS.

[Captioner] 19:54:10
IT WOULD BE NICE JUST TO HAVE 

[Captioner] 19:54:10
ONE SYSTEM WHERE YOU HAVE ONE 

[Captioner] 19:54:12
PASS AND YOU CAN JUST GO 

[Captioner] 19:54:13
ANYWHERE AND ALL THE SYSTEMS 

[Captioner] 19:54:17
CONNECT, WHETHER IT'S VTA, BART, 

[Captioner] 19:54:19
AC TRANSIT, ALL OF THEM.

[Captioner] 19:54:22
SO THAT'S ONE.

[Captioner] 19:54:24
SECOND, HOPEFULLY WE CAN 

[Captioner] 19:54:25
CONTINUE TO INCREASE THE 

[Captioner] 19:54:26
FREQUENCY OF SERVICE, ESPECIALLY 

[Captioner] 19:54:29
ON OUR MAIN AREAS, ESPECIALLY 

[Captioner] 19:54:32
OUR FOUR TODs, WE'VE INVESTED A 

[Captioner] 19:54:34
LOT OF TIME, MONEY, RESOURCES, 

[Captioner] 19:54:36
SO IF WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO 

[Captioner] 19:54:37
HAVE THOSE TOD CENTERS, WE'VE 

[Captioner] 19:54:39
GOT TO HAVE THE TRANSIT, CAN'T 

[Captioner] 19:54:41
MAKE THAT HAPPEN WITHOUT THE 

[Captioner] 19:54:42
TRANSIT, THE VISION THAT WAS 

[Captioner] 19:54:42
PROMISED.

[Captioner] 19:54:46
SO WHATEVER WE CAN DO TO TRY TO 

[Captioner] 19:54:48
INCREASE FREQUENCY IN THOSE FOUR 

[Captioner] 19:54:49
AREAS, THAT WOULD GEORGE BUSH A 

[Captioner] 19:54:49
LONG WAYS.

[Captioner] 19:54:55
 THAT WOULD GO A LONG WAYS.

[Captioner] 19:54:57
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 19:55:00
A COUPLE QUICK COMMENTS TOO, IF 

[Captioner] 19:55:02
IT'S OKAY, THAT HAVE BEEN 

[Captioner] 19:55:03
TRIGGERED DURING THE 

[Captioner] 19:55:04
CONVERSATIONS AND LISTENING TO 

[Captioner] 19:55:04
THE STUDENTS TALK.

[Captioner] 19:55:06
I WANTED TO THANK YOU FIRST FOR 

[Captioner] 19:55:07
STEPPING UP.

[Captioner] 19:55:08
I KNOW A FEW YEARS AGO, WHEN I 

[Captioner] 19:55:10
WAS ON THE SCHOOL BOARD, THE 

[Captioner] 19:55:12
SCHOOL DISTRICT DID CUT SOME OF 

[Captioner] 19:55:13
THE BUSING ROUTES BECAUSE OF 

[Captioner] 19:55:14
UNFORTUNATELY THE FUNDING THAT 

[Captioner] 19:55:15
CHANGED FROM THE STATE, AND I 

[Captioner] 19:55:16
KNOW THAT THAT WAS IMPORTANT 

[Captioner] 19:55:18
THEN FOR US TO HAVE THAT 

[Captioner] 19:55:19
PARTNERSHIP AND I KNOW THAT ZIPS 

[Captioner] 19:55:20
THEN, YOU'VE BEEN WORKING 

[Captioner] 19:55:21
CLOSELY WITH THE DISTRICT, BUT 

[Captioner] 19:55:23
AT THE SAME TIME, I ALSO OFTEN 

[Captioner] 19:55:24
GET STOPPED IN PUBLIC BECAUSE 

[Captioner] 19:55:26
THEY DON'T REALIZE WHO MANAGES 

[Captioner] 19:55:28
WHICH PIECE, BUT IN PARTICULAR, 

[Captioner] 19:55:30
HOPEFULLY ON EARLY DISMISSAL 

[Captioner] 19:55:31
DAYS, I KNOW THAT'S BEEN A 

[Captioner] 19:55:32
CONCERN SOMETIMES.

[Captioner] 19:55:34
IN THE PAST, I KNOW IN THE 

[Captioner] 19:55:35
PARTNERSHIP YOU'VE ALSO DONE 

[Captioner] 19:55:37
DOUBLE BUSES TO ENSURE THAT, AND 

[Captioner] 19:55:39
IF YOU COULD LOOK AT THAT, 

[Captioner] 19:55:40
BECAUSE I KNOW THAT'S ONE OF THE 

[Captioner] 19:55:41
QUESTIONS SOME OF THE STUDENTS 

[Captioner] 19:55:43
HAVE SAID TO ME, I'VE BEEN LEFT 

[Captioner] 19:55:44
MIND, BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T HAVE 

[Captioner] 19:55:46
ENOUGH SPACE FOR ME, AND SO 

[Captioner] 19:55:47
THEY'VE MADE SOME OF THOSE 

[Captioner] 19:55:47
GENERAL COMMENTS.

[Captioner] 19:55:50
I ALSO WANTED TO CIRCLE BACK 

[Captioner] 19:55:51
JUST TO AGAIN EMPHASIZE, I KNOW 

[Captioner] 19:55:52
WE TALKED ABOUT THE IRVINGTON 

[Captioner] 19:55:54
DISTRICT AND WHATNOT, BUT SINCE 

[Captioner] 19:55:56
WE'RE BUILDING SO MUCH HOUSING 

[Captioner] 19:55:57
AND TRANSIT-ORIENTED 

[Captioner] 19:55:58
DEVELOPMENT, IF THE BART STATION 

[Captioner] 19:56:00
IS NOT COMING AND THE AC TRANSIT 

[Captioner] 19:56:02
IS NOT THERE EITHER, THEN THAT 

[Captioner] 19:56:04
WOULD BE VERY BAD TO HAVE ALL 

[Captioner] 19:56:05
THIS TRANSIT-ORIENTED 

[Captioner] 19:56:06
DEVELOPMENT WITHOUT ANY 

[Captioner] 19:56:06
TRANSIT.

[Captioner] 19:56:10
AND THEN TO FOLLOW ON TO VICE 

[Captioner] 19:56:12
MAYOR SHAO'S COMMENTS, I 

[Captioner] 19:56:13
DEFINITELY APPRECIATE THE FACT 

[Captioner] 19:56:16
THAT YOU'VE BEEN FOCUSING ON THE 

[Captioner] 19:56:19
HYDROGEN FUEL BASED CELLS, IN 

[Captioner] 19:56:20
FACT I KNOW YOU WERE RECOGNIZED 

[Captioner] 19:56:22
AND HAD COVETED IN TERMS OF SOME 

[Captioner] 19:56:25
OF THE LOW EMISSION, NO EMISSION 

[Captioner] 19:56:26
GRANTS, AND I KNOW MOST RECENTLY 

[Captioner] 19:56:28
ALSO EVEN GOVERNOR NEWSOM HAD 

[Captioner] 19:56:30
TALKED ABOUT SOME OF THE 

[Captioner] 19:56:32
SPECIFIC EFFORTS FOR THAT IN 

[Captioner] 19:56:37
TERMS OF WORKING WITH GO BIZ AND 

[Captioner] 19:56:38
DEEDEE MYERS IN PARTICULAR IN 

[Captioner] 19:56:39
HELPING US TO GO CARBON 

[Captioner] 19:56:39
NEUTRAL.

[Captioner] 19:56:41
I ALSO WANTED THE PUBLIC TO KNOW 

[Captioner] 19:56:43
WHEN IT COMES TO THIS ARCHES 

[Captioner] 19:56:45
PROGRAM AND HAVING CALIFORNIA 

[Captioner] 19:56:47
DESIGNATED AS A HUB IS NOT JUST 

[Captioner] 19:56:49
FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY BUT 

[Captioner] 19:56:50
ALSO THE FACT THAT IT HAS 

[Captioner] 19:56:52
POTENTIAL, WHEN I LOOK OUT AT 

[Captioner] 19:56:53
OUR STUDENTS AND OTHERS FOR THE 

[Captioner] 19:56:54
FUTURE OF JOBS THAT OUT THERE, 

[Captioner] 19:56:55
SO THE NEW TYPES OF JOBS THAT 

[Captioner] 19:56:57
ARE BEING CREATED AND ALSO THE 

[Captioner] 19:56:58
FACT THAT THIS GOES TO SOME OF 

[Captioner] 19:56:59
THE QUESTIONS THAT WE'VE 

[Captioner] 19:57:02
COMMENTED ABOUT AT HEALTH EQUITY 

[Captioner] 19:57:03
AND ACCESS FOR CERTAIN 

[Captioner] 19:57:04
COMMUNITIES, BECAUSE OF THE 

[Captioner] 19:57:05
COSTS AND IMPACTS OVER THE YEARS 

[Captioner] 19:57:06
OF THE EMISSIONS.

[Captioner] 19:57:08
AND THE HOSPITALIZATIONS.

[Captioner] 19:57:10
SO THIS IS HOPEFULLY GOING TO 

[Captioner] 19:57:11
HELP WITH SOME OF THE 

[Captioner] 19:57:13
RESPIRATORY ISSUES AND 

[Captioner] 19:57:15
CHALLENGES AND ALSO TO BENEFIT 

[Captioner] 19:57:16
SPECIFICALLY I BELIEVE SOME OF 

[Captioner] 19:57:19
THE FOCUS OR ARCHES HAS BEEN 

[Captioner] 19:57:20
FOCUSED ON DISADVANTAGED 

[Captioner] 19:57:22
COMMUNITIES, LIKE 40% OF THAT IS 

[Captioner] 19:57:23
FOCUSED ON DISADVANTAGED 

[Captioner] 19:57:23
COMMUNITIES.

[Captioner] 19:57:24
SO I JUST WANTED TO COMMEND ALL 

[Captioner] 19:57:26
OF YOU FOR THAT PARTNERSHIP AND 

[Captioner] 19:57:27
LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING.

[Captioner] 19:57:29
I ALSO WANTED TO ENCOURAGE 

[Captioner] 19:57:31
STUDENTS, PARENTS, OR THOSE WHO 

[Captioner] 19:57:32
ARE ON DIFFERENT COMMISSIONS, I 

[Captioner] 19:57:36
KNOW HERE IN OUR CITY, WE HAVE 

[Captioner] 19:57:37
PARTNERSHIP WITH YOU IN THE PAST 

[Captioner] 19:57:38
WITH THE SENIORS COMMISSIONS, 

[Captioner] 19:57:41
WITH OUR YOUTH, I APPRECIATE -- 

[Captioner] 19:57:43
YOU'VE WORKED WITH ACTC, AND I 

[Captioner] 19:57:44
KNOW COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN WORKS 

[Captioner] 19:57:46
ON THERE WITH ME FOR THE FREE 

[Captioner] 19:57:47
AND REDUCED BUS PASS RIDES, 

[Captioner] 19:57:51
WHICH I THINK IS IMPORTANT FOR 

[Captioner] 19:57:52
THOSE WHOSE STUDENTS TO HAVE 

[Captioner] 19:57:54
TBREE AND REDUCED LUNCH TO GET 

[Captioner] 19:57:55
THOSE FREE PASSES BECAUSE IT'S 

[Captioner] 19:57:57
NOT JUST ABOUT GETTING TO AND 

[Captioner] 19:57:58
FROM SCHOOL, IT'S TO SPORTS 

[Captioner] 19:57:59
EVENTS, THEIR JOBS AND OTHER 

[Captioner] 19:57:59
ACTIVITIES.

[Captioner] 19:58:01
AND THEN IF THERE'S ANYTHING 

[Captioner] 19:58:03
THAT YOU HAVE IN TERMS OF 

[Captioner] 19:58:03
HANDOUT, I KNOW YOU MENTIONED 

[Captioner] 19:58:06
THE HARD COPIES THAT ARE IN 

[Captioner] 19:58:07
LANGUAGE TRANSLATIONS BUT IF 

[Captioner] 19:58:09
THERE'S ANY OTHER ACCESS TO 

[Captioner] 19:58:10
MATERIALS, I KNOW OUR FREMONT 

[Captioner] 19:58:13
FAMILY RESOURCE CENTER WHICH HAS 

[Captioner] 19:58:14
HIT OUR 26TH YEAR -- 25TH YEAR 

[Captioner] 19:58:16
IS THAT WE'RE ABLE TO THEN 

[Captioner] 19:58:17
PERHAPS ALSO HAVE THAT AVAILABLE 

[Captioner] 19:58:21
FOR PEOPLE TO HAVE DISTRIBUTED, 

[Captioner] 19:58:24
I THINK YOU MENTIONED ENGLISH, 

[Captioner] 19:58:24
SPANISH AND CHINESE.

[Captioner] 19:58:28
WE ALSO HAVE THREE SPANISH 

[Captioner] 19:58:32
IMMERSION PROGRAMS, MANDARIN 

[Captioner] 19:58:34
IMMERSION -- WE DON'T HAVE TO 

[Captioner] 19:58:35
PHYSICALLY HAVE ACCESS, I THINK 

[Captioner] 19:58:37
THE LINKS WOULD BE VERY 

[Captioner] 19:58:37
HELPFUL.

[Captioner] 19:58:38
AND THEN ALSO FINALLY AS I 

[Captioner] 19:58:40
MENTIONED BEFORE, THE SCHOOL FOR 

[Captioner] 19:58:41
THE DEAF AND THE SCHOOL FOR THE 

[Captioner] 19:58:44
BLIND, I KNOW THAT WHEN 

[Captioner] 19:58:44
COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL AND I 

[Captioner] 19:58:47
WERE THERE, THEY HAD SOME REALLY 

[Captioner] 19:58:49
DETAILED MAPS THAT THEY CREATED 

[Captioner] 19:58:51
TOO, JUST TO LET YOU KNOW, IN 3D 

[Captioner] 19:58:54
TO LOOK AT -- IN PARTICULAR FOR 

[Captioner] 19:58:55
WHITE CANE DAY, AND ONE OF THOSE 

[Captioner] 19:58:56
SKILLS THAT THEY WERE TEACHING 

[Captioner] 19:58:58
THE STUDENTS WERE LIFE SKILLS, 

[Captioner] 19:59:00
IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO GET TO 

[Captioner] 19:59:01
AND FROM THE BUSES AND SO ANY 

[Captioner] 19:59:03
SORT OF EFFORTS THAT YOU CAN DO 

[Captioner] 19:59:06
TO ENSURE THAT THEIR 

[Captioner] 19:59:08
COLLABORATION, IT WOULD BE VERY 

[Captioner] 19:59:08
BLESSED.

[Captioner] 19:59:12
WE ARE VERY BLESSED THAT THE 

[Captioner] 19:59:13
SCHOOL FOR THE DEAFERL IN 

[Captioner] 19:59:14
CALIFORNIA HAVING TWO LOCATIONS, 

[Captioner] 19:59:15
WE'RE ONE OF THEM, AND THE 

[Captioner] 19:59:17
SCHOOL FOR THE BLIND, IT'S THE 

[Captioner] 19:59:18
ONLY ONE IN CALIFORNIA FOR 

[Captioner] 19:59:19
PUBLIC SCHOOL, SO IF WE COULD 

[Captioner] 19:59:20
MAKE SURE THAT WE INCLUDE THAT, 

[Captioner] 19:59:21
WE WOULD APPRECIATE THAT BECAUSE 

[Captioner] 19:59:23
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN 

[Captioner] 19:59:25
WE PLAN THESE TRANSPORTATION 

[Captioner] 19:59:25
PLAN, IT'S SOMETHING FOR ALL.

[Captioner] 19:59:29
SO I THINK THAT'S MY ONLY OTHER 

[Captioner] 19:59:30
COMMENTS.

[Captioner] 19:59:31
ARE THERE ANY OTHER COMMENTS 

[Captioner] 19:59:33
