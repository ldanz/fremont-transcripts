19:23:51 SO GOOD EVENING TO YOU, TO THE COUNCILMEMBERS AND STAFF, AND TO THE RESIDENTS OF FREMONT.

19:23:58 FOR ALMOST 10 YEARS, I HAVE REQUESTED AND THE CITY COUNCIL HAS ALWAYS GRACIOUSLY ISSUED A PROCLAMATION 
19:24:02 RECOGNIZING JUNE AS ELDER ABUSE AWARENESS MONTH IN FREMONT.

19:24:12 MANY THANKS FOR, AGAIN, SHINING A MUCH-NEEDED SPOTLIGHT ON THE ISSUE OF ELDER ABUSE NEGLECT AND FINANCIAL 
19:24:12 EXPLOITATION.

19:24:20 THE AGE-OLD QUESTION IS, HOW DO WE END ELDER ABUSE IN FREMONT AND IN EVERY COMMUNITY?

19:24:22 SUCH A GOOD QUESTION.

19:24:26 UNFORTUNATELY, I DON'T HAVE THE MAGIC ANSWER TO THAT.

19:24:31 HOWEVER, THERE ARE AT LEAST TWO BASICS THAT WE CAN CONTINUE WORKING ON.

19:24:33 THE FIRST IS COLLABORATION.

19:24:41 COLLABORATION AMONGST AGENCIES SUCH AS LAW ENFORCEMENT, THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE, ADULT PROTECTIVE 
19:24:54 SERVICES, THE OMBUDSMAN, NON-PROFITS SUCH  AS -- SENIORS AND THE ENTIRE FREMONT COMMUNITY, ESPECIALLY SENIORS.

19:25:05 AND SECONDLY, EDUCATION OF SENIORS, ALL PROFESSIONALS AT EVERY LEVEL AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY TO RECOGNIZE 
19:25:13 THE SIGNS OF ELDER ABUSE, NEGLECT AND FINANCIAL EXPLOITATION, AND HOW AND TO WHOM TO REPORT SUSPECTED MISTREATMENT 
19:25:15 AND EXPLOITATION.

19:25:25 ALL THE PLANNING THAT HAS GONE INTO AN AGE-FRIENDLY FREMONT IS CONSISTENT WITH WHAT THIS PROCLAMATION IS TRYING 
19:25:31 TO ACHIEVE, WHICH IS AN  AGE-FRIENDLY AND SAFER COMMUNITY FOR FREMONT ELDERS.

19:25:32 THANK YOU.

19:25:39 AND NOW I THINK THE NEXT SPEAKER IS GOING TO BE MARIETTA ARROYO, WHO'S A SUPERVISOR WITH ADULT PROTECTIVE

19:30:06 I DON'T SEE OUR NEXT --

19:30:09 >> Ms. Gauthier: I DON'T SEE THE RECIPIENT FOR ITEM 3C.

19:30:20 SO IF WE CAN JUST GO AHEAD AND SKIP THAT AND MAYBE SEE IF THEY JOIN AFTER YOU GO ON WITH THE SRO PROGRAM 
19:30:20 RECOGNITION?

19:30:21 ?

19:30:22 >> Mayor Mei: YES, THANK YOU SO MUCH.

19:30:26 WE'LL BEGIN WITH THE NEXT ITEM, WHICH IS A RESOLUTION FOR SCHOOL RESOURCE OFFICER PROGRAM.

19:30:37 AND I WANTED TO NOTE THAT ACCEPTING THIS EVENING WILL BE SERGEANT CALVIN TANG, OUR SCHOOL RESOURCE OFFICER UNIT 
19:30:47 SUPERVISOR ALONG WITH SRO TEAM OFFICER REGGIE CANDLER, OFFICER MARRKEL SMITH, OFFICER RODOLFO PENA, OFFICER MICHAEL 
19:30:50 GILFOY AND OFFICER WILLIAM MALCOMSON.

19:31:02 I ALSO WAS GOING TO ASK A FAVOR, I DON'T KNOW IF HE HAS A COPY IN FRONT OF HIM, IF HE'D LIKE TO, WE HAVE A 
19:31:08 UNIQUE SITUATION TOO, WHERE THIS IS A RECOGNITION THAT WILL BE PRESENTED TO OUR SROs FOR AN HONOR, AND IT'S A 
19:31:14 UNIQUE SITUATION THAT I'M PROUD TO HAVE WORKED WITH THEM IN THE PAST IN THAT CAPACITY, WHICH IS OUR COUNCILMEMBER 
19:31:16 RICK JONES ALSO IS A RETIRED SRO OFFICER.

19:31:21 AND SO I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'D LIKE TO READ THAT THIS EVENING.

19:31:22 >> Councilmember Jones: I WOULD BE HAPPY TO.

19:31:23 THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR.

19:31:27 SO THIS ONE WILL NOT INCLUDE ALL THE WHEREASES AND WHEREFORES.

19:31:35 THE SCHOOL RESOURCE OFFICER PROGRAM BEGAN IN FLINT, MICHIGAN IN THE LATE 1950s AND BECAME WIDESPREAD IN THE 
19:31:42 LATE 1990’S. IT IS ESTIMATED THAT THERE ARE CURRENTLY 17,000 TO 20,000 SROS ACROSS THE NATION.TODAY.

19:31:50 THE FREMONT POLICE DEPARTMENT, UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF FORMER POLICE CHIEF CRAIG STECKLER, IMPLEMENTED THE SCHOOL 
19:31:56 RESOURCE OFFICER PROGRAM IN 1995 IN COLLABORATION WITH THE FREMONT UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT TO ENSURE A SAFE 
19:32:00 LEARNING ENVIRONMENT FOR STUDENTS, TEACHERS, AND SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS.

19:32:08 THE MISSION OF THE SCHOOL RESOURCE OFFICER UNIT IS TO SERVE AS A RESOURCE FOR  STUDENTS, PARENTS, AND FACULTY, 
19:32:16 BY INFORMALLY PROVIDING  GUIDANCE, SERVING AS A MENTOR AND A POSITIVE ROLE MODEL FOR STUDENTS, AND BY 
19:32:20 ENFORCING LAWS ON OR AROUND SCHOOL CAMPUSES.

19:32:26 SCHOOL RESOURCE OFFICERS STRIVE TO FOSTER POSITIVE RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR SCHOOLS AND OUR YOUTH.

19:32:31 THEY ATTEND SPORTING EVENTS, DANCES AND OTHER SCHOOL ACTIVITIES.

19:32:36 STUDENTS HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET TO KNOW THE OFFICERS AS MORE THAN JUST A UNIFORM.

19:32:45 FORMER SCHOOL RESOURCE OFFICERS ARE OFTEN STILL IN TOUCH WITH THEIR STUDENTS FROM A LONG -- I'M SORRY -- 
19:32:46 WITH STUDENTS LONG AFTER LEAVING THE POSITION.

19:32:49 IN SOME CASES, 20 YEARS OR MORE.

19:32:54 THE SCHOOL RESOURCE OFFICER IS A SPECIALIZED POSITION WITHIN THE FREMONT POLICE DEPARTMENT.

19:33:05 OFFICERS WHO APPLY FOR THE UNIT GO THROUGH AN IN-DEPTH INTERVIEW AND THEY ARE QUESTIONED BY GENERALLY SOMEONE 
19:33:09 FROM THE POLICE DEPARTMENT AS WELL AS THE SCHOOL DISTRICT TO DETERMINE THEIR SUITABILITY FOR THE POSITION.

19:33:16 OFFICERS WHO ARE SELECTED ARE SENT TO SPECIALIZED TRAINING, PROVIDED BY THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SCHOOL 
19:33:18 RESOURCE OFFICERS, OR NASRO.

19:33:24 THEY ATTEND ANNUAL NASRO TRAINING AS WELL AS OTHER SPECIALIZED TRAINING PROVIDED BY THE FREMONT POLICE 
19:33:27 DEPARTMENT AND OTHER ORGANIZATIONS  THROUGHOUT THE YEAR.

19:33:33 WE'RE EXTREMELY PROUD THAT THE FREMONT POLICE DEPARTMENT SCHOOL RESOURCE OFFICER UNIT IS  RECEIVING A MODEL 
19:33:39 AGENCY AWARD FROM THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SCHOOL RESOURCE OFFICERS AT THIS YEAR'S ANNUAL 
19:33:40 CONFERENCE.

19:33:45 THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF FREMONT HEREBY CONGRATULATES OUR SCHOOL RESOURCE OFFICERS AND COMMENDS THEM 
19:33:52 FOR THEIR DEDICATION TO PROVIDING A VALUABLE RESOURCE TO STUDENTS, PARENTS, FACULTY, AND THE COMMUNITY AS 
19:33:53 A WHOLE.

19:34:01 AND MADAME MAYOR, AS YOU MENTIONED, THIS IS DURING MY  29-YEAR TENURE AS A POLICE OFFICER, MY LAST NINE YEARS 
19:34:06 WERE SPENT AS A SCHOOL RESOURCE OFFICER AT WASHINGTON HIGH SCHOOL, AND I WILL SAY IT WAS THE MOST REWARDING 
19:34:07 ASSIGNMENT OF MY CAREER.

19:34:13 THERE IS NOTHING MORE IMPORTANT THAN WORKING WITH OUR YOUTH AND BUILDING THOSE RELATIONSHIPS AND MAKING SURE 
19:34:19 THAT EVERYBODY IS COMFORTABLE ENOUGH TO APPROACH A POLICE OFFICER WHEN THERE'S AN ISSUE.

19:34:20 SO THANK YOU.

19:34:25 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE AND FOR ALL THE SROs AND FOR THIS NOTABLE -- THIS IS OUR FIRST TIME 
19:34:31 BEING RECOGNIZED AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL, AND I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH MANY OF THE OFFICERS INCLUDING 
19:34:35 YOURSELF DURING THOSE TIME PERIODS IN MY SCHOOL BOARD TENURE AND AS A PARENT IN THE COMMUNITY.

19:34:45 SO ACCEPTING THE PROCLAMATION THIS EVENING WILL BE SERGEANT CALVIN TANG ALONG WITH THE FELLOW SCHOOL RESOURCE 
19:34:46 OFFICER.

19:34:50 SERGEANT TANG IS THE SCHOOL RESOURCE OFFICER UNIT  SUPERVISOR.

19:34:51 WELCOME.

19:34:52 >> THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR.

19:34:55 I APPRECIATE THE TIME AND THE EFFORTS THAT WERE MADE.

19:34:58 I WANT TO FIRST THANK COUNCILMEMBER JONES.

19:35:03 I HAVE KNOWN COUNCILMEMBER JONES FOR CLOSE TO 15 YEARS.

19:35:11 AND BEFORE BECOMING A POLICE OFFICER, I WAS A PROBATION OFFICER AND I LEARNED WHAT  SROs WERE THROUGH COUNCILMEMBER 
19:35:12 JONES.

19:35:22 AND HE REPRESENTED THE MODEL OF WHAT AN SRO SHOULD BE AND THAT'S WHAT I TRIED TO EMULATE WHEN I BECAME AN SRO WITH 
19:35:22 THE CITY OF FREMONT.

19:35:31 I WANT TO THANK COUNCILMEMBER JONES AND THE CITY OF FREMONT FOR TAKING THE MOMENT TO RECOGNIZE US AS A TEAM.

19:35:38 WE HAVE RECEIVED A LOT OF SUPPORT NOT ONLY FROM THE CITY BUT FROM OUR POLICE COMMAND STAFF FROM CHIEF WASHINGTON TO 
19:35:44 OUR THREE CAPTAINS, CAPTAIN NELSON, CAPTAIN TANG AND CAPTAIN HARNETT.

19:35:51 HOWEVER, THE WORK WE'VE DONE IN THE PAST YEAR COULD NOT HAVE BEEN DONE WITHOUT THE SIX PEOPLE WHO PRETTY MUCH 
19:36:00 HOLD IT ALL TOGETHER EVERY DAY, AND THAT'S OFFICERS REGGIE CANDLER, OFFICER MARRKEL SMITH, OFFICER JASON 
19:36:09  TREBZINSKI, OFFICER BILL MALCOMSON, OFFICER RUDY PENA, OFFICER MICHAEL GILFOY AND OUR NEWLY RETIRED OFFICER, 
19:36:12 WHICH IS OFFICER DEREK BURNS.

19:36:20 SO I JUST WANTED TO SAY THANK YOU TO THE SEVEN MEN WHO PRETTY MUCH HOLD THE UNIT TOGETHER, AND PRETTY MUCH RUN IT 
19:36:22 EVERY DAY.

19:36:29 WE'LL CONTINUE, WE RECOGNIZE THE CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE IN 2020, AND WE HEARD THE COMMUNITY AND WE HEARD 
19:36:35 THE CITY OF FREMONT, AND THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE HERE AND THE PEOPLE WHO MIGHT NECESSARILY BE CRITICS OF US.

19:36:42 WE'LL CONTINUE TO COLLABORATE, WE'LL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH OUR COMMUNITY, AND ONCE AGAIN, I JUST WANTED TO THANK 
19:36:52 THE MAYOR, THE COUNCIL, OUR POLICE COMMAND STAFF, BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY, THE OFFICERS WHO DO IT EVERY DAY, AND 
19:36:53 THE KIDS.

19:36:56 WE HAVE AMAZING STUDENTS AT FREMONT UNIFIED.

19:37:06 AND THE CHALLENGES THAT THEY MAKE IN TERMS OF JUST ASKING QUESTIONS AND THE INTERACTIONS WITH OUR OFFICERS IS WHY 
19:37:07 OUR TEAM DOES IT EVERY DAY.

19:37:15 SO I JUST WANTED TO THANK YOU GUYS AND ONCE AGAIN, I'M VERY, VERY HUMBLED FOR THE OFFER.

19:37:16 SO THANK YOU.

19:37:23 >> Mayor Mei: OUR APPRECIATION AND THANKS AND WE'RE GLAD THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE RECOGNIZED FOR THE 
19:37:28 SERVICES THAT YOU PROVIDE OUR COMMUNITY AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL, AND CONGRATULATIONS AGAIN FOR THIS HONOR 
19:37:33 AND RECOGNITION UNTIL PROVIDING WITH QUALITY SERVICE WE NEED FOR OUR COMMUNITY.

19:37:41 SO NEXT I WAS GOING TO GO BACK, IF I SAW -- DID THE OTHER RECIPIENT -- WERE THEY ABLE TO JOIN US?

19:37:44 >> Ms. Gauthier: I HAVEN'T SEEN THEM LOG IN.

19:37:45 >> Mayor Mei: OKAY.

19:37:46 THANK YOU.

19:37:49 SO I GUESS WE WILL PASS ON THAT ITEM AT THIS TIME.

19:37:54 AND WE'LL TURN TO PUBLIC COMMUNICATIONS.

19:37:58 ORAL COMMUNICATIONS ARE FOR ITEMS THAT ARE NOT AGENDIZED THIS EVENING.

19:38:04 THEY WILL BE ABLE TO BE ADDRESSED UNDER PUBLIC COMMUNICATIONS.

19:38:08 COMMUNICATIONS RECEIVED VIA EMAIL WILL BE PLACED ON FILE AND CONSIDERED PART OF THE PUBLIC RECORD.

19:38:18 MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WISHING TO SPEAK MAY DO SO BY CLICKING ON THE RAISE HAND ICON OR BY DIALING IN STAR NINE.

19:38:25 IF NOTED ON THE ZOOM SCREEN -- IF NOT NOTED ON THE ZOOM SCREEN, PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME, IF YOU'RE SPEAKING ON 
19:38:29 BEHALF OF AN ORGANIZATION, PLEASE STATE THE NAME OF THE ORGANIZATION YOU ARE REPRESENTING.

19:38:35 CITY CLERK, IF WE COULD LOOK AT THAT TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY PUBLIC SPEAKERS THIS EVENING?

19:38:37 >> Ms. Gauthier: JOHN HINDS.

19:38:38 >> Mayor Mei: WONDERFUL.

19:38:39 WE'LL GIVE 2 MINUTES.

19:38:40 THANK YOU.

19:38:41 >> HELLO, EVERYONE.

19:38:45 THIS IS A NARROW TECHNICAL ISSUE BUT AN IMPORTANT ONE.

19:38:54 ON THE AGENDA -- SORRY -- ON THE STAFF REPORT FOR TONIGHT'S MAIN AGENDA ITEM, THE BUDGET, IF YOU LOOK ON PAGE 2 OF 
19:38:59 THE STAFF REPORT, YOU SEE A LINK YOU CAN CLICK ON THAT SAYS "PROPOSED BUDGET."

19:39:04 IF YOU DO CLICK ON THAT LINK, YOU GET "PAGE NOT FOUND."

19:39:09 THIS HAS BEEN HAPPENING A LOT FOR THE LAST THREE WEEKS OR SO, AND I GATHER THAT THERE'S A BIG MIGRATION GOING ON 
19:39:16 WITH ALL THE CITY'S FILES BEING MOVED FROM ONE SET OF FOLDERS AND SERVERS TO ANOTHER AND STUFF LIKE THIS HAPPENS.

19:39:22 I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PROJECT PLAN FOR THAT EFFORT DOES INCLUDE A STEP AT THE END WHERE 
19:39:26 THEY'RE GOING TO ADD A REDISTRICT LINK FOR EVERY FILE MOVED.

19:39:35 BECAUSE WITHOUT COMPREHENSIVE REDIRECTS LIKE THAT, A WHOLE BUNCH OF HISTORY GETS LOST, THE ABILITY TO TRACE ANY 
19:39:37 DOCUMENT BACK TO SUPPORTING DOCUMENTS GETS BROKEN.

19:39:46 AS EXEMPLIFIED BY ANYBODY TRYING TO FOLLOW ALONG WITH TONIGHT'S MAIN AGENDA ITEM, HITTING A DEAD END ON 
19:39:46 THEIR FIRST CLICK.

19:39:50 SO PLEASE MAKE SURE EVERYTHING IS REDIRECTED SO NONE OF THE STUFF THERE IS LOST.

19:39:51 THANK YOU.

19:39:55 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:40:04 I JUST WANTED TO NOTE REAL QUICKLY THAT SOME OF YOU, IF YOU'VE HAD A CHANCE TO SEE OUR WEBSITE, WE DID RECENTLY JUST, 
19:40:10 THE LAST WEEK AND A HALF, LAUNCH A NEW WEBSITE, SO PERHAPS THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE WILL BE WORKING ON ADDRESSING 
19:40:13 WHEN WE JUST TRANSFERRED BUT DULY NOTED AND THANK YOU.

19:40:19 WE ARE TRYING TO MIGRATE OUR WEBSITE AND TO PROVIDE EASIER ACCESS BUT CERTAINLY IF WE CAN'T SEE THAT, THAT 
19:40:25 WOULD NOT BE TO THE BENEFIT OF THE PUBLIC SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU CAN JOIN US THIS EVENING OR FOLLOW ALONG, 
19:40:26 AND WE'LL MAKE SURE TO CORRECT THE LINK.

19:40:30 I DON'T SEE ANY OTHER SPEAKERS.

19:40:33 >> Ms. Gauthier: THERE ARE NO ADDITIONAL SPEAKERS.

19:40:35 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:40:37 >> Ms. Gauthier: WHOOPS.

19:40:41 UNLESS KELLY ABREU JUST RAISED HIS HAND TO SPEAK UNDER ORAL COMMUNICATION.

19:40:48 >> Mayor Mei: KELLY, DID YOU RAISE YOUR HAND FOR THIS ITEM?

19:40:52 >> NO, I RAISED MY HAND FOR THE AUDIT REPORTS.

19:40:54 >> Mayor Mei: OKAY, I APOLOGIZE.

19:40:54 THANK YOU.

19:40:58 SO NEXT -- I APOLOGIZE, WE PASSED THAT BY ACCIDENT, SIR.

19:41:05 LET'S GO BACK TO THE ITEM THAT WAS PULLED FROM THE CONSENT CALENDAR, WHICH IS ITEM 2I AS IN ICE CREAM, 
19:41:09 WHICH IS THE FISCAL YEAR 2021 FINANCIAL AUDIT.

19:41:12 AND YOU HAVE A COMMENT ON THAT?

19:41:13 WELCOME, KELLY.

19:41:15 >> I DO.

19:41:25 IF YOU LOOK AT THIS FINANCIAL REPORT FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2021, YOU SEE OPERATING INDICATORS BY 
19:41:35 FUNCTION FOR A COMPREHENSIVE ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT, LAST 10 CALENDAR YEARS, AND ON PAGE 200 OF THE REPORT, 
19:41:44 YEAH, 200, THEY TALK ABOUT SOME INDICATORS, LIKE ARRESTS AND MOVING VIOLATIONS.

19:41:47 BOTH OF THOSE ARE WRONG BY THE ADMISSION OF YOUR STAFF.

19:41:57 NOW, YOU KNOW, JUST BECAUSE THESE ARE UNAUDITED DOESN'T MEAN THEY ARE ALLOWED TO BE INACCURATE OR INCORRECT 
19:41:59 OR  KNOWINGLY WRONG.

19:42:05 THE CITY KNOWS THIS, THAT THEY ARE WRONG, AND THE CITY IS NOT MAKING ANY MOVES TO GO BACK AND CORRECT THIS 
19:42:06 REPORT.

19:42:08 FOR EXAMPLE, PHYSICAL ARRESTS.

19:42:14 HALFWAY THROUGH THIS 10-YEAR PERIOD, THE DEFINITION OF AN ARREST GOT CHANGED SHOWL.

19:42:24 SO THAT YOU WOULD EXPECT ANY NORMAL RATIONAL FINANCIAL ANALYST OR ACCOUNTANT OR REPORTER TO GIVE YOU AN 
19:42:31 ADJUSTED NUMBERS, EITHER GOING BACKWARDS OR FORWARDS OR SOMEHOW ADJUSTING FOR THE CHANGE IN DEFINITION.

19:42:32 THAT'S NOT HAPPENING.

19:42:38 SO YOU'RE GETTING ONE SET OF NUMBERS DEFINED ONE WAY, ANOTHER SET OF NUMBERS DEFINED ANOTHER WAY.

19:42:40 IT'S VERY, VERY WRONG AND IT NEEDS TO BE FIXED.

19:42:41 THEN MOVING VIOLATIONS.

19:42:45 THAT'S WHEN YOU HAND OUT A SPEEDING TICKET OR WHATEVER.

19:42:54 LAST YEAR, IT WAS 13,000  TICKETS, BUT -- AND PARKING TICKETS INCLUDED, BUT ACTUALLY YOU HAD ANOTHER 13 THOWL 
19:42:55 HANDED OUT AT COSTCO.

19:43:01 YOU VIRTUALLY DOUBLED THE NUMBER OF MOVING VIOLATIONS.

19:43:07 AGAIN, THEY AREN'T INCLUDED THIS YEAR, LAST YEAR, ANY YEAR, AND A MOVING VIOLATION ADDS A POINT TO YOUR RECORD 
19:43:09 AND COSTS A LOT OF MONEY.

19:43:14 EVERYONE KNOWS WHAT IT IS, AND IT INCLUDES A RED LIGHT CAMERA TICKET.

19:43:24 THOSE NUMBERS NEED TO BE DEFINED AS INCLUDING RED LIGHT CAMERA TICKETS AND NEED TO BE --

19:43:31 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU VERY MUCH, AND I WAS GOING TO JUST ASK THAT IF THERE ARE A LONGER LIST, PLEASE FEEL FREE TO 
19:43:33 SEND US AN EMAIL ALSO FOR OUR  RECORDS.

19:43:44 SO FOR ITEM 2I, DO I HAVE ANY MOTION OR QUESTION?

19:43:46 >> Councilmember Cox: I MOVE.

19:43:48 >> Mayor Mei: MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER COX.

19:43:49 SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER JONES.

19:43:55 MAY I ASK FOR A ROLL CALL VOTE ON THAT ITEM, 2I AS IN ICE  CREAM?

19:43:59 >> Ms. Gauthier: COUNCILMEMBER COX, AYE.

19:44:02 COUNCILMEMBER SHAO, AYE.

19:44:04 COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, AYE.

19:44:06 COUNCILMEMBER JONES, AYE.

19:44:10 COUNCILMEMBER KENG, AYE.

19:44:11 VICE MAYOR SALWAN, AYE.

19:44:14 MAYOR MEI, AYE.

19:44:16 THANK YOU.

19:44:18 THE MOTION PASSES UNANIMOUSLY.

19:44:26 THE NEXT ON OUR COUNCIL, I JUST WANT TO CHECK TO SEE IF THE RECIPIENT CAME AND I DON'T SEE THEM.

19:44:32 SO WE'LL GO ON TO OUR REGULARLY SCHEDULED PUBLIC ITEMS.

19:44:43 WHICH INCLUDE 5A, WHICH IS THE SECOND PUBLIC HEARING AND ADOPTION AS THE FISCAL YEAR 2022/23 OPERATING BUDGET 
19:44:45 AND APPROPRIATIONS LIMIT.

19:44:50 AND THERE'S NO PRESENTATION AS WE RECEIVED THAT PREVIOUSLY.

19:44:55 BUT I KNOW THAT FINANCE DIRECTOR DAVID PERSSELIN IS AVAILABLE TO COMMENT ON QUESTIONS.

19:44:59 AND WE'LL BEGIN WITH ANY  CLARIFYING QUESTIONS FROM THE COUNCILMEMBERS.

19:45:10 SEEING NONE AT THIS TIME, I'LL TURN IT OVER TO OUR ATTENDEES.

19:45:13 ARE THERE ANY -- I'M GOING TO OPEN THE PUBLIC HEARING.

19:45:21 AND ANY MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC WISHING TO ADDRESS OR SPEAK ON THIS ITEM MAY DO SO BY PRESSING THE RAISE HAND ICON OR 
19:45:22 BY PRESSING STAR NINE.

19:45:27 I SEE KELLY ABREU.

19:45:27 WELCOME.

19:45:36 >> I'D JUST LIKE TO EXPRESS MY DISAPPOINTMENT, BOTH LAST WEEK AND THIS WEEK, THIS IS THE FIRST READING 
19:45:37 AND THE SECOND READING.

19:45:41 THERE'S NO INTEREST, THE LACK OF INTEREST, THE DISINTEREST, THE DISREGARD OF FINANCIAL REPORTING BY 
19:45:48 THE CITY COUNCIL AND BY STAFF THAT DON'T GO THROUGH THE  DARN -- GOING BACK AND GIVING US A LITTLE REFRESHER 
19:45:55 IN THE FORM OF SLIDES OR COMMENTS, IT'S VERY DISHEARTENING THAT THIS CITY COUNCIL DOESN'T REALLY CARE ABOUT 
19:45:58 FINANCIAL REPORTS AND BUDGET FORECASTS AND THINGS.

19:46:00 BECAUSE IT'S ACTUALLY KIND OF IMPORTANT.

19:46:08 YOU KNOW, IF YOU ACTUALLY LOOK AT THIS THING, IT SAYS SOMETHING IN THERE ABOUT HOW ALL THESE -- THE BASICS, 
19:46:13 BASIC ASSUMPTION, THE UNDERLYING ASSUMPTION HERE IS THAT THE U.S. ECONOMY IS GOING TO HAVE MODERATE 
19:46:14 GROWTH IN THE FUTURE.

19:46:25 MODERATE GROWTH IN THE U.S. ECONOMY, WHICH MEANS WE'RE  NOT -- THERE'S NO RECESSION OR NO STAGNATION IN THIS 
19:46:26 FORECAST.

19:46:33 AND THAT IS ACTUALLY A HIGHLY QUESTIONABLE ASSUMPTION, IT NEEDS TO BE DISCUSSED AND  DEBATED AND THERE'S 
19:46:41 PROBABLY OTHER ISSUES IN THIS MASSIVE FINANCIAL BUDGET THAT NEED TO BE DISCUSSED AND CONSIDERED BY THE CITY 
19:46:48 COUNCIL, BUT THE CITY COUNCIL HAS NO INTEREST IN LOOKING THROUGH ALL THIS AND HEARING FROM MR. PERSSELIN ABOUT 
19:46:50 ALL THESE, YOU KNOW, BORING FINANCIAL NUMBERS.

19:46:57 YOU KNOW, I REALLY THINK THAT THIS NEEDS TO CHANGE, AND WE NEED TO PERHAPS EVEN BRING IT BACK.

19:47:04 YOU KNOW, PUT ANOTHER BUDGET ITEM HERE OR AGENDA ITEM IN THE FUTURE.

19:47:12 NOW WE CAN RECEIVE MORE EDUCATION AND UPDATES ON THE BUDGET, ON THE PROGRESS, AND ON WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE 
19:47:18 FROM THE FINANCE DEPARTMENT SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE THIS STATE OF TOTAL DISREGARD AND TOTAL APATHY IN THE 
19:47:20 FUTURE AS WE GO ALONG.

19:47:20 THANKS.

19:47:26 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:47:31 I'D LIKE TO BRING IT BACK TO THE COUNCIL FOR ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME.

19:47:40 >> Mayor Mei: I WILL MAKE A QUICK COMMENT.

19:47:47 WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE BUDGET, WE USUALLY HAVE INITIAL BUDGET ASSUMPTIONS AS WELL AS A REPORT OUT ON 
19:47:55 THE STATE'S FISCAL STATUS AND THEN WE DO HAVE MULTIPLE MEETINGS WHERE WE HAVE BUDGET HEARINGS.

19:48:01 AND I DON'T KNOW IF -- I SEE ALSO COUNCILMEMBER SHAO HAS SOME COMMENTS, BUT IF OUR FINANCE DIRECTOR PERSSELIN 
19:48:05 WOULD LIKE TO PROVIDE ANY INSIGHT ON THAT.

19:48:14 AND I ALSO WANTED TO NOTE THAT AS WE ARE FORMING OUR BUDGET AND APPROVING IT, WE DO DO INTERIM MID YEAR BUDGET 
19:48:18 ADOPTION UPDATES AND ALSO REVIEW THE BUDGET AT THE CLOSE TO SEE WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN THAT AREA.

19:48:25 AND CERTAINLY THESE LAST COUPLE YEARS HAVE BEEN VERY FISCALLY CHALLENGING, BUT WE'RE REALLY APPRECIATIVE OF 
19:48:31 DIFFERENT FUNDING SOURCES AND WE'RE WORKING HARD ON THOSE AREAS, WHETHER IT'S THE ARPA FUNDING OR OTHER AREAS 
19:48:39 TO SECURE OPPORTUNITIES TO HELP DISCUSS THIS, AND WE'D BE HAPPY TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH ANY MEMBERS OF THE 
19:48:42 PUBLIC IF THEY'D LIKE TO HAVE ANY AFTERWARDS.

19:48:44 SO COUNCILMEMBER SHAO, YOU HAD YOUR HAND RAISED.

19:48:46 >> Councilmember Shao: THANK  YOU, MADAME MAYOR.

19:48:54 I WAS JUST GOING TO MAKE THE SAME COMMENT AS YOU DID, SO I WAS JUST GOING TO MENTION THAT THE BUDGET IS 
19:49:06 NOT SET IN STONE AND SHOULD THERE BE ANY CHANGE OF THE ECONOMIC STATUS FOR EITHER THIS COUNTRY, THE STATE, COUNTY 
19:49:12 AND THE CITY, THEN THERE WILL BE NOT ONLY INTERIM REPORTS BUT ADJUSTMENTS.

19:49:20 SO IN THAT CASE, OF COURSE ANY MAJOR ADJUSTMENTS WOULD NEED THE APPROVAL OF THE CITY COUNCIL.

19:49:25 I JUST WANTED TO MAKE THAT CLARIFICATION.

19:49:25 THANK YOU.

19:49:30 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:49:33 DIRECTOR PERSSELIN, WOULD YOU HAVE ANY -- WE ALSO HAVE COUNCILMEMBER COX.

19:49:35 I SEE YOUR HAND RAISED.

19:49:44 >> Councilmember Cox: I JUST WANTED TO POINT OUT, WITH THE BUDGET OVERVIEW, THAT IT REALLY SPELLS OUT A LOT OF OUR 
19:49:54 OUTLOOK IN 2022 TO 2023, AND WE ARE TAKING IN CONSIDERATION OF THE PANDEMIC-RELATED RECESSION, BUT ALSO 
19:50:08 THE HIGH INFLATION THAT'S OCCURRING, EVEN WITH THE RUSSIAN INNOVATION OF UKRAINE AND ANY PUBLIC HEALTH -- ARE 
19:50:13 BUILT INTO THE BUDGET AT THE TIME WE ARE REVIEWING THIS THAT WE'VE TAKEN ALL ECONOMIC INDICATORS, BUT ALSO 
19:50:21 KNOWING WHERE OUR SOURCES OF MONEY HAVE COME FROM, WHICH WE KNOW IT'S COMING FROM PROPERTY TAXES WHICH WE THINK THE 
19:50:28  THANK THE PROPERTY OWNERS, THE RESIDENTS HERE IN FREMONT, BUT ALSO LOOKING FORWARD INTO WHAT THE GROWTH 
19:50:31 WOULD BE.

19:50:40 THOSE ARE BEING CONSIDERED RIGHT NOW, THAT THE GROWTH IS 3% FOR 2022, BUT SLOWING IN THE MID PART OF 2023.

19:50:51 SO WE ARE LOOKING AND ACCOUNTING FOR THE THINGS THAT ARE NORMALLY GOOD GOVERNMENT FINANCIAL PRACTICES THAT 
19:51:00 ARE TO BE ADOPTED AND I APPRECIATE HAVE BEEN A FIRST HEARING AND NOW A SECOND HEARING, AND ALSO THAT I APPRECIATE 
19:51:09 OUR STAFF THAT HAS PREPARED THIS LENGTHY DOCUMENT, AND IT'S REALLY DETAILING OUT, BY DEPARTMENT, BY WHAT 
19:51:17  WHAT THE CITY AND TRANSPARENCY OF WHAT WE'RE PLANNING TO DO, THE ACCOUNTABILITY OF WHERE THE MONEY IS 
19:51:17 BEING SPENT.

19:51:26 AND I REALLY APPRECIATE ALL THE EFFORTS OF DAVE AND HIS WHOLE TEAM, EVERYONE THAT HAS REVIEWED AND LOOKED AT 
19:51:34 VERIFIED ALL THIS INFORMATION, THAT THIS IS VERY CONSISTENT IN OUR GOVERNMENT FINANCIAL PRACTICES, 
19:51:44 ESPECIALLY OF THE GASB, AND REALLY JOIN WHERE OUR GROWTH IS AND ACCOUNTING FOR SOME OF THE NEW THINGS, AND MAYBE DAVE 
19:51:52 CAN HIGHLIGHT A COUPLE OF THINGS IN THE BUDGET AS WE GO FORWARD, ESPECIALLY IN THE INTEREST OF PUBLIC SAFETY THAT WE 
19:51:59 JUST  HONORED OUR SCHOOL RESOURCE OFFICERS, BUT ALSO OUR FIRE AND POLICE AND SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE 
19:52:02 WORKING TOWARDS TO HELP BUILD IN THAT AREA AS WELL.

19:52:11 >> Mr. Persselin: SURE, I'LL GO AHEAD AND RESPOND IF THAT'S  OKAY.

19:52:12 >> Mayor Mei: SURE.

19:52:22 I ALSO SEE COUNCILMEMBER RICK JONES AND SALWAN BUT WE'LL ASK THEM AFTERWARDS.

19:52:27 >> Mr. Persselin: SORT OF FOLLOWING UP ON THE COLLECTION OF COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE, YOU KNOW, AS JUST A SORT OF 
19:52:36 BRIEF SUMMARY, STAFF MET WITH CITY COUNCIL AT THE CITY COUNCIL RETREAT BACK IN FEBRUARY TO GET GUIDANCE FROM 
19:52:38 THE COUNCIL ON COUNCIL PRIORITIES.

19:52:44 AS COUNCILMEMBER COX ALLUDED TO, ONE OF THE HIGHEST PRIORITIES WAS PUBLIC SAFETY.

19:52:48 ANOTHER FOUNDATIONAL PRIORITY WAS FISCAL STABILITY.

19:52:57 AND SO AS STAFF PUT TOGETHER THE PROPOSED OPERATING BUDGET FOR NEXT YEAR, THOSE WERE THINGS THAT WERE TOP 
19:53:00 OF MIND.

19:53:08 AS A RESULT, YOU SEE IN THE PROPOSED BUDGET THAT WE ARE ACTIVATING A NEW FIRE TRUCK COMPANY, SO THAT'S NINE 
19:53:12 FIRE STAFF, A NEW COMPANY FOR THE CITY.

19:53:23 WE ALSO HAVE ADDED TWO NEW POLICE OFFICER POSITIONS, SO DEFINITELY ADDING STAFF AND CAPABILITY AND PUBLIC 
19:53:28 SAFETY, WE'RE ADDING 26 POSITIONS OVERALL CITYWIDE.

19:53:38 SOME OF THOSE RESPOND TO INCREASING DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY WITHIN THE CITY, OTHERS RESPOND TO HOMELESS NEEDSMENT 
19:53:46 SO WE HAVE DEFINITELY FOCUSED ON ADDRESSING WHAT THE CITY COUNCIL TOLD US AND WHAT WE'VE HEARD FROM THE 
19:53:49 COMMUNITY THAT THEY RANK AS THEIR HIGHEST PRIORITIES.

19:54:00 WE PRESENTED THE BUDGET AT THE INITIAL MEETING IN MAY, AND THEN WE HAD THE FIRST PUBLIC HEARING LAST WEEK AND 
19:54:02 THIS IS THE SECOND PUBLIC HEARING.

19:54:11 GOING FORWARD, ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I WANTED TO NOTE OR A COUPLE THINGS I WANTED TO NOTE IS THAT AS 
19:54:18 COUNCILMEMBER COX ALLUDED TO, WE HAVE INCORPORATED OUR BEST ESTIMATES OF BOTH REVENUES AND EXPENDITURES IN THE 
19:54:20 PROPOSED BUDGET.

19:54:30 KNOWING THAT WE'RE FACING INFLATION, A NUMBER OF THE EXPENDITURE ESTIMATES INCORPORATE RELATIVELY HIGH INFLATION 
19:54:33 ESTIMATES FOR THIS NEXT YEAR.

19:54:42 AND THEN SECONDLY, GOING BACK TO AN ACTION THAT COUNCIL TOOK LAST FALL, THE CITY COUNCIL NOT ONLY RESTORED OUR 
19:54:49 GENERAL FUND BUDGET UNCERTAINTY RESERVE TO THE LEVEL IT WAS PRE-COVID, BUT THEN INCREASED TO $10 MILLION.

19:54:59 SO ONE OF THE REAL THINGS THAT WE HAVE IN OUR HIP POCKET IN CASE INFLATION DOES REALLY SPIKE OR THE ECONOMY 
19:55:07 REALLY DOES SLOW DOWN TO A LEVEL OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT YEAR, THAT THE CITY IS REALLY EXPERIENCING SOME SORT 
19:55:11 OF EITHER LOW REVENUES OR REALLY HIGH EXPENSES.

19:55:20 WE HAVE THE BUDGET UNCERTAINTY RESERVE TO DRAW ON WHILE WE REALLY FIGURE OUT WHAT WE NEED TO DO NEXT IN ORDER TO 
19:55:21 RESPOND TO WHATEVER'S HAPPENING.

19:55:26 AND I WOULD JUST CIRCLE RIGHT BACK TO WHAT HAPPENED IN 2020 WITH COVID.

19:55:33 THE COUNCIL HAD ESTABLISHED THE BUDGET UNCERTAINTY RESERVE, WHICH GAVE US A LITTLE BIT OF TIME AND OPPORTUNITY TO 
19:55:40 RESPOND IN THAT FISCAL YEAR, WE WENT BACK TO COUNCIL, WE IMPOSED A HIRING FREEZE TO REDUCE EXPENDITURES IN THAT 
19:55:49 YEAR, AND THEN WE TOOK A NUMBER OF ACTIONS TO REDUCE EXPENDITURES IN THE NEXT-YEAR BUDGET, ULTIMATELY REDUCING 
19:55:56 THAT NEXT-YEAR BUDGET BY $18 MILLION TO RESPOND LARGELY TO WHAT WE WERE EXPECTING TO BE REDUCED  REVENUES.

19:56:04 SO THAT'S ESSENTIALLY WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF THE ECONOMY DOES GO INTO A RECESSION THAT HAS A SIGNIFICANT 
19:56:11 IMPACT ON EITHER THE CITY'S REVENUES OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR, OR EXPENDITURES OVER THE NEXT 
19:56:12 YEAR.

19:56:15 SO WE OUGHT TO BE WELL SITUATED.

19:56:19 NOBODY KNOWS WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT.

19:56:27 THE FED IS MEETING RIGHT NOW, THEY'RE GOING TO ISSUE A REPORT OR HAVE A PRESS RELEASE TOMORROW ALONG WITH 
19:56:36 PROJECTIONS OF WHAT THEY THINK IS GOING TO HAPPEN OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT  YEAR, BUT IF YOU'RE A FED  WATCHER 
19:56:41 LIKE I AM, YOU WILL KNOW THAT THEY CHANGE THOSE PROJECTIONS EVERY TIME THEY  MEET, AND SO TRYING TO PREDICT 
19:56:44 THE FUTURE IS VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE.

19:56:53 SO THE BEST WE CAN DO IS TO PLAN FOR WHAT SEEMS TO BE THE MOST LIKELY SCENARIO AND THEN TRY TO BUILD SAFETY 
19:57:01 MECHANISMS LIKE OUR BUDGET UNCERTAINTY RESERVE TO HELP US WEATHER ANY ADVERSE DEVIATIONS FROM THAT.

19:57:05 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:57:11 AND I KNOW THAT WE ALSO HAVE RAISED HANDS FROM COUNCILMEMBER JONES AND VICE MAYOR SALWAN.

19:57:13 COUNCILMEMBER JONES?

19:57:14 >> Councilmember Jones: THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR.

19:57:17 AND THANK YOU, DIRECTOR PERSSELIN AND YOUR TEAM.

19:57:20 VERY COMPREHENSIVE BUDGET, AS USUAL.

19:57:27 YOU KNOW, ALL OF US RECEIVED A HARD COPY OF IT, AND IT WAS A VERY INFORMATIVE READ FROM COVER TO COVER.

19:57:29 YOU KNOW, YOU CAN'T PLAN FOR THE FUTURE.

19:57:31 YOU ALWAYS PLAN FOR THE WORST AND HOPE FOR THE BEST.

19:57:38 BUT THIS IS A FLUID DOCUMENT, AND WE CAN MAKE ADJUSTMENTS AS NECESSARY GOING FORWARD, AND I AM READY TO MAKE 
19:57:42 A MOTION TO APPROVE AS SOON AS VICE MAYOR SALWAN MAKES HIS COMMENTS.

19:57:42 THANK YOU.

19:57:43 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:57:44 VICE MAYOR SALWAN.

19:57:48 >> Vice Mayor Salwan: THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR.

19:57:53 WELL, I REALLY APPRECIATE MR. PERSSELIN'S COMMENTS BECAUSE I WAS GOING TO DISCUSS THE TIMELINE.

19:58:01 I FEEL LIKE WE HAVE SPENT SO MUCH TIME TALKING ABOUT THE BUDGET, ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF THE CURRENT PANDEMIC, AND 
19:58:07 YOU KNOW, BIG PICTURE, WE'RE DOING BETTER THAN MOST CITIES AND I THINK WE MADE SOME TOUGH DECISIONS AND WE PUT 
19:58:11 SOME MONEY SET ASIDE FOR PAYING DOWN PENSIONS.

19:58:19 WE COMMITTED TO PUBLIC SAFETY, ROAD REPAIR, AND WE ARE A FULL SERVICE CITY AND I THINK THE FUTURE IS OVERALBRIGHT 
19:58:24 FOR FREMONT, ALTHOUGH WE DO NEED TO ANTICIPATE RECESSION COMING.

19:58:29 NOBODY KNOWS WHAT THE FED IS GOING TO DO AND NOBODY KNOWS WHAT THE ECONOMY IS GOING TO DO, SO WE JUST HAVE TO 
19:58:36 KEEP PLUGGING ALONG, AND I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS THAT MR. PERSSELIN IS THINKING AHEAD AND WE ARE A 
19:58:41 FISCAL-CONSERVATIVE CITY THAT'S TRYING TO PAY DOWN ITS DEBT AND MAKE SURE THAT WE HOLD THE LINE ON COSTS.

19:58:43 SO THANK YOU, AND I'M HAPPY TO SECOND COUNCILMEMBER JONES' MOTION.

19:58:46 >> Mayor Mei: WONDERFUL.

19:58:48 SO WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND.

19:58:53 MAY I ASK FOR -- LET ME SEE IF THERE'S ANY OTHER COMMENTS.

19:59:20 AND I APPRECIATE EVERYONE FOR JOINING US ON THIS CONVERSATION.

19:59:30 NEXT ON OUR AGENDA THIS EVENING IS ANY REPORT OUTS FROM -- ORAL REPORTS FROM MEETINGS.

19:59:38 I WANTED TO SHARE THAT I DON'T KNOW IF OUR ONE LAST SPEAKER WAS ABLE TO JOIN US.

19:59:39 I WANTED TO CHECK ONE MORE TIME.

19:59:42 I DIDN'T SEE HIM ABLE TO JOIN  US.

19:59:53 BUT JUST TO LET PEOPLE KNOW THAT WE WILL BE CLOSING THIS EVENING IN HONOR OF OUR FORMER COUNCILMEMBER JOHN 
20:00:00 DUTRA, WHO WILL BE HAVING A MEMORIAL SERVICE THIS WEEK, ON FRIDAY, SO I WANTED TO SHARE THAT INFORMATION, AND 
20:00:07 I HAD ORIGINALLY HAD A PROCLAMATION TO SHARE, WHICH WE WILL PRESENT TO THE FAMILY, BUT I WAS HOPING TO BE ABLE TO 
20:00:16 PRESENT IT AND OUR HEARTS GO OUT TO THE FAMILY AT THIS TIME, AND SO THERE IS A MEMORIAL SERVICE AT HARBOR LIGHT 
20:00:18 CHURCH ON -- I BELIEVE IT'S THIS FRIDAY.

20:00:24 SO I WANTED TO SHARE THAT, AND IF THOSE WHO ARE INTERESTED WILL MAKE SURE IT'S AVAILABLE FOR ALL TO BE ABLE TO JOIN 
20:00:26 US AT HARBOR LIGHT CHURCH.

20:00:32 SO I ALSO SEE I HAVE RAISED HANDS FOR REPORT OUTS AND I HAVE SOME OTHER THINGS TO REPORT BUT I'LL SEE IF 
20:00:41 COUNCILMEMBER COX AND COUNCILMEMBER YANG SHAO, AND PLEASE DON'T DROP OFF, WE'RE GOING TO CLOSE IN MEMORY OF OUR 
20:00:43 FORMER COUNCILMEMBER JOHN DUTRA.

20:00:43 >> Councilmember Cox: THANK YOU.

20:00:52 ON A HAPPIER NOTE, I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE, AND THIS MAY BE THAT SOME OF MY OTHER FELLOW COLLEAGUES, MAYOR AND 
20:00:56 CITY COUNCIL MIGHT HAVE RECEIVED A CALL TODAY.

20:01:04 AS YOU MAY RECALL, BACK IN  APRIL, THERE WAS A RESOLUTION THAT WAS PASSED BY OUR CITY COUNCIL IN SUPPORT OF 
20:01:15 WASHINGTON HOSPITAL TO BECOME A EMERGENCY TRAUMA CENTER, LEVEL 2, AND WE JUST RECEIVED WORD TODAY THAT THEY 
20:01:25 GOT APPROVED BY ALAMEDA COUNCIL TEAL EMERGENCY MEDICAL AGENCY, AND I JUST HAD WANTED TO PASS ON TO ALL OF OUR 
20:01:33 COMMUNITY AS WELL AS OUR CITY COUNCILMEMBERS AND CITY STAFF AND ALL OF THOSE THAT ARE  LISTENING TONIGHT 
20:01:43 THAT IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE'RE VERY  EXCITED AND WASHINGTON HOSPITAL, AGNES COCHRAN FROM THE OFFICE OF THE 
20:01:51 PRESIDENT OF WASHINGTON HOSPITAL HAD CONTACTED ME TO LET ME KNOW THAT THIS HAD PASSED AND THAT THEY ARE WORKING 
20:02:00 TOWARDS MAKING THIS IMPLEMENTED AND HAPPEN RIGHT HERE IN FREMONT, SO I THINK THIS WOULD BE SAVING A LOT OF 
20:02:08 LIVES FOR OUR FREMONT RESIDENTS, BUT THOSE THAT MAY PASS THROUGH AND BE IN OUR CORRIDOR TO SEEK MEDICAL 
20:02:20 ASSISTANCE, THAT THIS WOULD BE A BIG WIN-WIN FOR EVERYONE TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE TOPNOTCH MEDICAL SERVICES AND 
20:02:24 REALLY HELP THE COMMUNITY AND OUR WELLNESS.

20:02:34 SO I'M REALLY EXCITED TO REPORT THAT, AND THAT THIS IS A VERY POSITIVE LIGHT FOR THE CITY OF FREMONT AND THE 
20:02:36 PARTNERSHIP WITH WASHINGTON HOSPITAL.

20:02:37 THANK YOU.

20:02:40 >> Mayor Mei: ABSOLUTELY.

20:02:47 I'M VERY EXCITED THAT ANGUS REACHED OUT AND I'M GLAD WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON IT FOR SO MANY YEARS.

20:02:53 THIS IS SOMETHING I'VE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH BOTH OUR PREVIOUS CEO NANCY HARPER AS WELL AS 
20:03:01 OUR CURRENT CEO, KIMBERLY, AND IN FACT I'M GLAD TO BE ABLE TO REPRESENT THE CITY OF FREMONT ON THAT CONVERSATION 
20:03:10  AS WELL AS THE DISCUSSION AND REVEUL FROM THE CONSULTANTS FOR THE PRESENTATION.

20:03:16 THIS IS SOMETHING THE CITY OF FREMONT HAS BEEN LOOKING AT FOR WELL OVER 20 YEARS AND THIS IS A MOVE IN THE RIGHT 
20:03:22 DIRECTION, AND THEY'VE BEEN A GREAT AND EXCELLENT PARTNER NOT JUST FOR OUR CITY BUT THE CITY OF UNION CITY, CITY 
20:03:28 OF NEWARK AND  HAYWARD, IN LIGHT OF THE NEEDS WE'VE SEEN RIGHT NOW IN THIS PANDEMIC PERIOD, THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO 
20:03:36 COME FORTH WITH THE MORRIS HEIN MAN CENTER, FOR THE CRITICAL CARE UNIT, FOR ALSO THE ADDITIONAL SERVICES THAT 
20:03:46 I THINK ARE CRITICAL IN TERMS OF THE FUTURE, THE JOINT MEDICAL CENTER FOR UCSF, WASHINGTON HOSPITAL DOWN IN WARM 
20:03:53 SPRINGS, AND THIS IS A TRULY AN ITEM THAT WILL HELP US TO PROVIDE BETTER SERVICES IN LIGHT OF SOME OF THE 
20:03:58 CHALLENGES, THE TRAFFIC, TRYING TO GET PEOPLE TO CRITICAL SERVICES THAT ARE NEEDED, SO IN LOOKING AT THIS STUDY, 
20:04:04 WE WERE COMPETEING WITH SOME OTHER OPPORTUNITIES AND I'M SURE THOSE WILL ALSO BE FULFILLED, BUT LOOKING AT THE 
20:04:11 ANALYSIS AND STUDY, I'VE SEEN FURTHER GROWTH IN NORTH COUNTY AND FOR THE SOUTH COUNTY, WE JUST HAVEN'T HAD THAT 
20:04:17 TYPE OF SERVICE LEVEL THAT WE'VE REALLY NEEDED, SO IT'S DEFINITELY A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION, AND WE'RE EXCITED 
20:04:29 THAT OUR COUNCIL, IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THEIR  LEADERSHIP TEAM AND THEIR BOARD, REALLY EXCITED, I SAW THE PRESS 
20:04:35 RELEASE, ALAMEDA COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH HAD ALSO PRESENTED THIS SO I WAS REALLY HAPPY TO SEE IT MOVE FORWARD 
20:04:38 FROM THE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AND TO GET THEIR SUPPORT.

20:04:40 SO THIS IS HOPEFULLY A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

20:04:43 COUNCILMEMBER SHAO, I THINK YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO PRESENT.

20:04:47 I HAVE ONE MORE THING AFTER THIS BESIDES CLOSING.

20:04:49 >> Councilmember Shao: THANK  YOU, MADAME MAYOR.

20:04:55 BEFORE WE'RE MAKING PROGRESS IN HEALTHCARE, I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO REPORT WE HAD THE MONTHLY MEETING AT 
20:05:05 THE ALAMEDA COUNTY HOUSING AUTHORITY, AND I WAS SITTING ON THE COMMISSION AS THE VICE CHAIR, AND WE PASSED THE 
20:05:09 ANNUAL BUDGET JUST LIKE WHAT THE CITY JUST DID.

20:05:19 IN ADDITION, WE'RE ALSO IN THE PROGRESS OF REVIEWING THE PERFORMANCE OF EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR CURT WEISS AS PART 
20:05:23 OF OUR COMMISSION'S ROUTINE.

20:05:30 I NEED TO JUST POINT OUT THAT ALAMEDA COUNTY HOUSING AUTHORITY HAS BEEN DOING GREAT EFFORT TO FIGHT AGAINST 
20:05:39 HOMELESSNESS IN ALAMEDA COUNTY, INCLUDING FREMONT, AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT WITH THE HELP OF 
20:05:42 THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FUNDING.

20:05:43 THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

20:05:44 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

20:05:47 I'M VERY EXCITED TO SEE THAT.

20:05:55 I ALSO WANTED TO SHARE THAT EARLIER THIS WEEK, WE ALSO HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO WELCOME REPURPOSE OF SOME OF OUR 
20:06:04 CITY SPACE AND WE HAD LINK LOGISTICS COME, AND THEY WERE ABLE TO REPURPOSE A SIGHT AND WE'RE EXCITED TO SEE THEM 
20:06:10 DELIVER ADDITIONAL SPACE, AND I WAS  JOINED BY COUNCILMEMBER KENG AT THAT OPPORTUNITY.

20:06:16 SO FOR MORE INFORMATION, WE TALKED ABOUT TRYING TO ENGAGE THE PUBLIC, AND I WANTED TO LET PEOPLE KNOW THAT NEXT 
20:06:23 WEEK, THERE WILL BE THE FIRST TIME IN A WHILE THE STATE OF THE CITY MEETING, WHICH WILL BE HELD IN CONJUNCTION WITH 
20:06:35 THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE, AND I'D LIKE TO INVITE ALL OF YOU, IT WILL BE AT THE DOWNTOWN EVENT CENTER FROM 8:00 TO 
20:06:36 10:00 A.M. ON THURSDAY, JUNE 23RD.

20:06:41 SO I JUST WANTED TO SHARE THAT WE WILL BE PRESENTING SOME OF THAT INFORMATION.

20:06:46 IT WILL ALSO BE AN OPPORTUNITY TO ASK QUESTIONS AND TO BE ABLE TO SEE ONE ANOTHER.

20:06:53 BUT MUCH OF WHAT'S BEEN DONE HAS BEEN THINGS THAT WE WORK IN CONCERT WITH ONE ANOTHER AS COUNCILMEMBERS, AND 
20:07:01 ALSO IN PARTNERSHIP WITH SO MANY WHO HAVE COME BEFORE US, WHETHER ON COUNCIL OR MAYORS, PAST LEADERSHIP.

20:07:05 ALSO ESPECIALLY I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE ALL OF OUR CITY STAFF.

20:07:15 THAT BEING SAID, I WANTED TO CLOSE THIS EVENING WITH THE MOMENT OF SILENCE IN LIGHT OF OUR RECENT LOSS OF OUR FORMER 
20:07:20 COUNCILMEMBER AND ASSEMBLYMEMBER JOHN DUTRA, JOHN DUTRA, SENIOR.

20:07:23 I'D LIKE TO ASK EVERYONE TO PAUSE FOR A MOMENT OF SILENCE, PLEASE.

20:07:24 THANK YOU.

20:07:47 THANK YOU.

20:07:56 SO AGAIN, I JUST WANTED TO MENTION THAT THERE WILL BE A SERVICE, AND IT'S AT HARBOR LIGHT CHURCH FOR OUR FORMER 
20:07:59 COUNCILMEMBER AND  ASSEMBLYMEMBER.

20:08:05 IT WILL BE FRIDAY, IF I'M CORRECT, APOLOGIZE --

20:08:07 >> Councilmember Cox: AT 2:30.

20:08:14 >> Mayor Mei: 2:30 TO 4:00 P.M. AT HARBOR LIGHT CHURCH ON THORNTON AVENUE.

20:08:15 JUST WANTED TO NOTE THAT.

20:08:21 AND THANK ALL OF YOU, TO BE WELL, TO BE SAFE AND TO BE HEALTHY.

20:08:31 I ALSO WANTED TO NOTE THAT ON BEHALF OF THE CITY, WE HAD SIGNED A LETTER AND AWARENESS FOR GUN VIOLENCE AND IN 
20:08:38 PARTICULAR EVERY TOWN IN AMERICA AS WELL AS MAYORS AGAINST ILLEGAL GUNS, AND WE WANTED YOU TO KNOW THAT 
20:08:42 HOPEFULLY WE'LL SEE ADDITIONAL ACTION BEING TAKEN.

20:08:48 WITH THAT, I'D LIKE TO CLOSE THE MEETING, AGAIN, AND BE WELL, BE SAFE, AND TO BE HEALTHY, AND LOOKING FORWARD 
20:08:50 TO WORKING WITH ALL OF YOU AS WE MOVE FORWARD.
