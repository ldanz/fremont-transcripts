19:08:55 AND I'D LIKE TO SHARE THE  FOLLOWING.

19:09:06 AND I BELIEVE ACCEPTING THIS EVENING WILL BE KHLOE HALE, AND SHE'S AGE 9, ALONG WITH HER MOTHER TIFFANY.

19:09:09 SO I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND BEGIN WITH THIS.

19:09:19  WHEREAS, THE HEALTH AND WELL-BEING OF ALL CHILDREN THROUGHOUT OUR CITY ARE OF PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE TO FREMONT’S 
19:09:25 FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES; AND WHEREAS, THOUSANDS OF CHILDREN ARE BORN WITH BIRTH DEFECTS EVERY YEAR,  INCLUDING 
19:09:32 APPROXIMATELY 40,000 CHILDREN (1 IN 110) IN THE UNITED STATES WHO BEGIN LIFE WITH ONE OF MORE THAN 35 
19:09:40 IDENTIFIED FORMS OF CONGENITAL HEART DEFECTS; AND WHEREAS, CONGENITAL HEART DEFECTS ARE AMONG OUR CITY’S MOST 
19:09:45 COMMON BIRTH DEFECTS AND THEY CAN BE FATAL DUE TO THEIR SERIOUSNESS, INSUFFICIENT EFFECTIVE MEDICAL 
19:09:53 INTERVENTION OPTIONS AND THE LIMITED AVAILABILITY OF INFANT DONOR HEARTS; AND WHEREAS, THE ORIGINS AND SYMPTOMS 
19:10:02 OF CONGENITAL HEART DEFECTS ARE BECOMING MORE READILY IDENTIFIABLE AND THE RANGE OF SURGICAL OPTIONS ARE 
19:10:08 EXPANDING CONTINUOUSLY, THANKS TO DOCTORS’ AND SCIENTISTS’ DILIGENT RESEARCH EFFORTS AND FIELD EXPERIENCES 
19:10:18 THAT EXTEND OUR BODY OF KNOWLEDGE EVERY DAY; AND WHEREAS, THERE IS MUCH TO LEARN ABOUT THE CAUSES OF AND 
19:10:24 EFFECTIVE TREATMENTS FOR CONGENITAL HEART DEFECTS AND IT IS IMPORTANT FOR PARENTS, FAMILY MEMBERS PEDIATRICIANS 
19:10:32 AND NURSES TO RECOGNIZE THE WARNING SIGNS ASSOCIATED WITH CONGENITAL HEART DEFECTS AMONG NEWBORNS SO THEY MAY 
19:10:40 PROVIDE PROPER TREATMENT AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE; AND WHEREAS, MANY OF OUR CITY’S FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES ARE 
19:10:49 DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY AFFECTED BY INFANT ILLNESS AND DEATH CAUSED BY CONGENITAL HEART DEFECTS, AND I 
19:10:53 APPLAUD THE EFFORTS OF DOCTORS AND SCIENTISTS EVERYWHERE WHO WORK DILIGENTLY TO SOLVE LIFE’S MEDICAL 
19:11:00 MYSTERIES AND TO IMPROVE

19:11:01 THE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR ALL.

19:11:06  NOW, THEREFORE, THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF FREMONT, RECOGNIZE FEBRUARY 7-14, 2022 AS CONGENITAL 
19:11:17 HEART DEFECT AWARENESS WEEK IN THE CITY OF FREMONT, AND CALL THIS OBSERVANCE TO THE ATTENTION OF ALL OUR CITIZENS.

19:11:23 AND I'D LIKE TO WELCOME BACK KHLOE HALE, AS WELL AS -- ALONG WITH HER MOTHER, TIFFANY, WHO I THINK THEY HAVE

19:11:31 >> HI.

19:11:49 CHD HEART AWARENESS WEEK BY KHLOE.

19:11:50 CHD AWARENESS WEEK.

19:11:53 CHD STANDS FOR CONGENITAL HEART DEFECT.

19:11:58 FEBRUARY 7TH TO THE 14TH IS AWARENESS WEEK.

19:12:12 FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS, I HAVE BEEN INVITED TO CITY COUNCIL MEETINGS, AND MAYOR MEI HAS PRESENTED ME WITH A 
19:12:17 PROCLAMATION OF CHD AWARENESS WEEK.

19:12:32 GREAT IMPORTANCE.

19:12:34 THIS ALSO HELPS SHARE AWARENESS.

19:12:42 1 IN 110 PEOPLE ARE BORN WITH A CHD.

19:12:47 LOOK AT THE PICTURE TO SEE HOW MANY HEARTS THAT REALLY IS.

19:12:51 NEWBORN HEART.

19:12:57 WHEN A BABY IS BORN, THEIR HEART IS THE SIZE OF A WALNUT.

19:13:02 THAT MEANS HEART SURGEONS HAVE PRETTY COOL SKILLS.

19:13:06 I WAS ONLY 10 DAYS OLD WHEN THEY FIXED MY HEART.

19:13:10 HEART WARRIOR.

19:13:14 I WANTED TO SHARE THIS SPECIAL WEEK WITH YOU.

19:14:49  WHEREAS, EACH YEAR, AMERICANS ACROSS OUR COUNTRY OBSERVE BLACK HISTORY MONTH BY CELEBRATING THE ACHIEVEMENTS 
19:14:55 OF AFRICAN AMERICANS AND RECOGNIZE THEIR CENTRAL ROLE IN THE UNITED STATES HISTORY; AND WHEREAS, BLACK

19:17:57 YOU SHARING THIS ON BEHALF OF OUR HUMAN RELATIONS COMMISSION, WHO WE WORK SO CLOSELY WITH, AND THANK YOU FOR

19:19:04 GOD SPEED TO YOU ALL.

19:19:05 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:19:16 AND IN FACT ALSO, EVEN HERE LOCALLY, WITH OUR EDUCATION LEADERS, WE'RE FORTUNATE AND I KNOW HE'S A FREQUENT 
19:19:22 OBSERVER OF OUR COUNCIL MEETINGS, I DON'T KNOW IF HE'S ON TONIGHT, BUT HERE AT OHLONE COLLEGE, WE ALSO WERE 
19:19:29 FORTUNATE TO WELCOME OUR FIRST BLACK PRESIDENT FOR THE COLLEGE, DR. ERIK BISHOP, AND I THANK HIM FOR HIS 
19:19:30 PARTNERSHIP.

19:19:34 BUT IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE SUCH HISTORIC MOMENTS.

19:19:43 WE ALSO HAVE HAD IN THE PAST THE OPPORTUNITY TO RECOGNIZE OUR FIRST FEMALE POLICE OFFICER, SHIRLEY WRIGHT, 
19:19:51 WHO WAS ALSO WITH US FOR MANY YEARS, AND SO I JUST WANTED TO THANK THIS OPPORTUNITY, WE HAVE SO MANY 
19:19:58 EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS AND PARTNERSHIPS, WHETHER IT'S CAL STATE EAST BAY, CAL STATE HAYWARD, AND I 
19:20:07 KNOW THAT NEXT COMING UP WILL BE OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE MONTH SO BE WILL I VERY EXCITED TO RECOGNIZE AND THAT NOR 
19:20:14  HONOR SOME OF THOSE DURING THAT TIME PERIOD.

19:20:18 IT'S NOT JUST A PIECE OF BLACK HISTORY, IT'S A PIECE OF AMERICAN HISTORY.

19:20:23 THAT'S WHAT WE REALLY WANT TO UPLIFT AND THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF ALL TO OUR COMMUNITY.

19:20:28 SO THANK YOU FOR RAISING THIS VOICE, AND FOR GIVING US THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE WITH YOU, THOUGH IN THE PAST 
19:20:33 WE'VE DONE IT MORE OFTEN IN PERSON, WE'RE GLAD TO HAVE YOU JOIN US VIRTUALLY THIS EVENING.

19:20:34 THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH.

19:20:36 >> THANK YOU.

19:20:43 >> Mayor Mei: I THINK I HAVE A HAND RAISED.

19:20:45 COUNCILMEMBER COX.

19:20:47 >> YES.

19:20:55 I WOULD LIKE TO FIRST THANK DYESHA FOR REPRESENTING THE HUMAN RELATIONS COMMISSION, WHICH IS A VERY IMPORTANT 
19:21:03 COMMISSION TO REPRESENT ALL THE MEMBERS OF FREMONT TO EMBRACE DIVERSITY, EQUITY AND INCLUSION.

19:21:08 SO THANK YOU SO MUCH, DYESHA AND YOUR WHOLE ENTIRE COMMISSION.

19:21:18 AS HAS BEEN STATED BEFORE THAT I'M VERY PROUD OF THE HISTORY OF FREMONT, THAT WE HAVE FIVE AFRO-AMERICANS THAT ARE 
19:21:28 LEADING AS PART OF THE CITY LEADERSHIP, AND IT SO IMPORTANT THAT WE UNDERSTAND FROM THE AFRO-AMERICAN STANDPOINT OF 
19:21:35 WHAT IT'S LIKE IF WE'RE NOT AT THE TABLE, BUT WE KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE WHEN YOU'RE NOT AT THE TABLE, AND THAT 
19:21:39 SPECIAL LENS LENDS ITSELF TO MAKING IT AN EVEN BETTER PLACE HERE IN FREMONT.

19:21:48 AND I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE IT'S CLEAR THAT THERE WERE TWO PROCLAMATIONS FOR BLACK HISTORY MONTH SUBMITTED TO 
19:21:48 FREMONT  MAYOR.

19:21:57 ONE WAS SUBMITTED BY THE HUMAN RELATIONS COMMISSION, AND THE SECOND ONE WAS SUBMITTED BY MYSELF THAT WAS 
19:22:08 CUSTOMIZED TO RECOGNIZE THAT WE HAVE THE BLACK HISTORY MONTH PROCLAMATION FOCUSED ON EDUCATIONAL EXCELLENCE THAT 
19:22:15 IS TIED IN WITH OHLONE COLLEGE, TIED IN WITH HISTORICALLY BLACK COMMUNITY -- HISTORICALLY BLACK COMMUNITY COLLEGES 
19:22:20 AND UNIVERSITIES, AND ALSO THAT IS TIED IN WITH THE DIVINE 9.

19:22:27 AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT YOU REALIZE THAT I SUBMITTED THIS ON JANUARY THE 31ST --

19:22:31 >> Councilmember Shao: EXCUSE ME, MAYOR, POINT OF ORDER?

19:22:38 >> Councilmember Cox: NO, I HAVE THE FLOOR AS THE CITY COUNCILMEMBER, AND I NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE 
19:22:47 UNDERSTANDS THAT THIS -- THERE WAS A SECOND PROCLAMATION THAT WAS -- I WAS NOTIFIED ON FEBRUARY 2ND THAT WAS 
19:22:52 REJECTED AND WAS NOT APPROVED BY FREMONT MAYOR LILY MEI.

19:22:59 AND I SENT AN EMAIL BACK TO FREMONT MAYOR LILY MEI TO REQUEST A COPY --

19:23:00 >> Councilmember Shao: ONCE AGAIN, MAYOR?

19:23:01 POINT OF ORDER?

19:23:09 >> Councilmember Cox: I AM SPEAKING -- ON TERMS OF THE TOPIC, IT'S TALKING ABOUT BLACK HISTORY MONTH PROCLAMATION.

19:23:17 AND I ASKED TO SHARE WITH ME ANY OF THE PROCLAMATION THAT WAS SUBMITTED AND BE ABLE TO DISCUSS WITH ME AND SO THAT 
19:23:26 THERE'S A CUSTOMIZED PROCLAMATION THAT I HAD SUBMITTED THAT WAS STILL REJECTED AND HAS NOT BEEN RESPONDED BY 
19:23:26 FREMONT MAYOR LILY MEI.

19:23:35 AND TO THIS DAY, THIS IS DISRESPECTING ME AS AN ELECTED FREMONT CITY COUNCILMEMBER SINCE FEBRUARY 2ND, YOU 
19:23:40 HAVE NOT WRITTEN TO ME, YOU HAVE NOT CALLED ME, BUT YOU KNOW HOW TO CALL AND ASK ABOUT AN ENDORSEMENT, BUT YOU 
19:23:48 DON'T KNOW HOW TO CALL ME TO TALK ABOUT -- TO TALK ABOUT THE BLACK PROCLAMATION --

19:23:52 >> Ms. Margolis: COUNCILMEMBER COX, I THINK WE'RE GOING BEYOND THE PURPOSE OF THIS ITEM WHICH IS --

19:23:54 >> Councilmember Cox: NO, I'M SORRY.

19:23:57 >> Ms. Margolis: COUNCILMEMBER COX, THERE ARE OTHER OPPORTUNITIES FOR YOU TO HAVE THIS DISCUSSION.

19:24:05 >> Councilmember Cox: FOR THE AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY, YOU CANNOT JUST REPLY TO MY EMAIL THAT I ASKED WHAT IS 
19:24:06 THE --

19:24:09 >> Councilmember Jones: MAYOR MEI, I'D LIKE TO MOVE FOR A RECESS, PLEASE.

19:24:12 >> Councilmember Cox: I AM NOT GOING TO --

19:24:15 >> Ms. Margolis: YOU DON'T -- THIS ISN'T THE APPROPRIATE TIME TO HAVE THIS DISCUSSION.

19:24:22 >> Councilmember Cox: I'M SORRY, I AM THE CITY COUNCILMEMBER AND I HAVE -- THERE IS NO TIME LIMIT OF ME NOT 
19:24:23 SPEAKING ON THIS AGENDA ITEM.

19:24:29 AND IT'S DISRESPECTING ME --

19:24:34 >> Ms. Margolis: THERE IS A BROWN ACT REQUIREMENT THAT YOU TALK ABOUT ITEMS ON THE AGENDA, AND THIS ITEM THAT 
19:24:39 YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT AND THE DISCUSSION YOU'RE HAVING AND THE DISPUTE THAT YOU'RE HAVING WITH MAYOR MEI IS NOT ON 
19:24:42 THE AGENDA RIGHT NOW SO I HAVE TO ASK YOU TO PLEASE NOT DISCUSS THAT AT THIS MOMENT.

19:24:45 >> Councilmember Cox: WELL, NO, BECAUSE I NEVER GOT AN ANSWER.

19:24:49 REGARDING THIS.

19:24:56 BUT IT'S A BLACK HISTORY MONTH AND IT TIES WITH OHLONE COLLEGE THAT YOU JUST MENTIONED WITH DR. ERIK BISHOP.

19:25:01 OHLONE COLLEGE IS A COLLEGE THAT'S PART OF THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES.

19:25:10 IT IS TIED IN SO THAT EVERYONE THAT GRADUATES FROM OHLONE COLLEGE CAN GO TO A HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGE SO 
19:25:12 THEY CAN TRANSFER THEIR CREDITS.

19:25:19 THE HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGE IS TIED IN WITH THE DIVINE 9 SUPPORTED BY THE NINE BLACK FRATERNITIES AND SORORITIES.

19:25:26 THESE ACTIONS ARE NOT IN CONSISTENCY WITH WHAT WE HAVE IN REPRESENTING THE CITY OF  FREMONT.

19:25:30 AGAIN, I AM NOT BEING HEARD.

19:25:36 >> Ms. Margolis: I THINK YOU MADE YOUR POINT THAT THOSE OTHER INSTITUTIONS ARE ALSO INSTITUTIONS THAT SHOULD AND 
19:25:41 COULD BE RECOGNIZED FOR BLACK HISTORY MONTH, AND I THINK WE SHOULD LEAVE IT THERE AND MOVE ON.

19:25:44 >> Councilmember Cox: I ALSO THINK THAT I DESERVE TO HAVE AN ANSWER.

19:25:49 IT'S VERY RUDE TO NOT BE RESPONDED TO AFTER ALL THIS  TIME.

19:25:50 THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE.

19:25:58 >> Mayor Mei: THERE WAS AN ANSWER THAT IT WAS -- AND THERE WAS AN ANSWER IN TERMS OF I KNOW THAT THERE WAS --

19:26:00 >> Councilmember Cox: THERE WAS NO ANSWER, LILY MEI.

19:26:03 >> Ms. Margolis: AGAIN, THIS IS NOT THE APPROPRIATE TIME TO HAVE THAT ARGUMENT.

19:26:04 WE CAN DISCUSS THIS AT ANOTHER TIME.

19:26:13 SO I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO NOT TALK ABOUT THE DISPUTE ANY LONGER AND TO GET ON WITH RECOGNIZING BLACK HISTORY 
19:26:15 MONTH AND MOVING ON WITH OUR AGENDA.

19:26:17 >> Councilmember Cox: IT IS AMERICAN HISTORY.

19:26:25 BLACK HISTORY IS AMERICAN HISTORY, AND ALSO THAT WE ADOPTED CORETTA SCOTT KING, WHO WENT TO A HISTORICALLY BLACK 
19:26:31 COLLEGE, WHOSE NAME IS BEARING ON OUR BUILDING FOR THE FREMONT DOWNTOWN EVENT CENTER.

19:26:41 AND WITH THAT, SHE IS A MEMBER OF ALPHA KA TA ALPHA SORORITY AND OF THE DIVINE 9, WHERE SHE WENT TO HISTORICALLY 
19:26:42 BLACK COLLEGE CALLED SPELLMAN.

19:26:48 IT IS THE FULL CIRCLE OF US EMBRACING DIVERSITY, AND EQUITY, BUT WE HAVE SO MUCH MORE TO GO THROUGH TO MAKE THIS A 
19:26:49 BETTER PLACE FOR EVERYONE.

19:27:00 >> Ms. Margolis: MAYOR MEI, I SUGGEST YOU MOVE ON TO THE NEXT ITEM.

19:27:00 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:27:05 SO THE NEXT ITEM IS ACTUALLY OUR PUBLIC COMMUNICATIONS.

19:27:11 AND I'D LIKE TO INVITE THE PUBLIC TO SPEAK AND THEY CAN RAISE THEIR HANDS.

19:27:14 AND WE CAN CALL ON THE SPEAKERS.

19:27:18 AND SUSAN, IF YOU COULD HELP ME WITH THAT?

19:27:25 >> YES, MAYOR MEI.

19:27:33 WE HAVE A LOT OF OPEN MICS AS PANELISTS HERE, WHICH I THINK IS CAUSING SOME BANDWIDTH ISSUES, SO IF EVERYONE CAN 
19:27:35 PLEASE MUTE, I'D APPRECIATE THAT.

19:27:35 THANK YOU.

19:27:37 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:27:44 >> Ms. Gauthier: AND WE ARE AT 1 MINUTE PER SPEAKER, IS THAT CORRECT, MADAME MAYOR?

19:27:45 >> Mayor Mei: THAT IS CORRECT.

19:27:46 >> Ms. Gauthier: THANK YOU.

19:27:49 ALANDA JOHNSON?

19:27:52 I HOPE I'M NOT MISPRONOUNCING THAT.

19:27:55 ALANDA JOHNSON?

19:27:57 >> THANK YOU SO MUCH.

19:28:08 MY NAME IS ALANDA JOHNSON, AND I AM FROM THE HAYWARD SOUTH ALAMEDA COUNTY NAACP, AND I JUST WANTED TO COME BACK 
19:28:17 ON AND THANK MADAME MAYOR AND COUNCILMEMBER COX AND THE REST OF THE COUNCIL FOR RECOGNIZING US LAST MONTH.

19:28:20 I MEAN THE LAST MEETING FOR BLACK HISTORY MONTH.

19:28:29 I APPRECIATE EVERYTHING THAT YOU ALL DO, IN PARTICULAR, MADAME MAYOR, IN PARTNERING WITH US AND WITH THE 
19:28:34 COMMUNITY, WE DEFINITELY SEE YOUR SUPPORT FOR THE BLACK COMMUNITY AND IT'S VERY MUCH APPRECIATED.

19:28:43 YOU CANNOT WRITE ENOUGH PROCLAMATIONS TO RECOGNIZE EVERYTHING THAT'S GONE ON IN BLACK HISTORY AND EVERY 
19:28:48 ORGANIZATION THAT'S WORKING TOGETHER, BUT WE CAN LOCK ARMS AND CONTINUE TO WORK TOGETHER, AND I THANK YOU SO MUCH 
19:28:56 FOR RECOGNIZING US ON BEHALF OF OUR PRESIDENT, FREDDIE DAVIS THAT COULDN'T JOIN, I JUST WANT TO SHOW MY 
19:28:57 APPRECIATION TO ALL OF YOU.

19:28:58 SO THANK YOU.

19:29:01 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING THIS EVENING.

19:29:05 NEXT SPEAKER, PLEASE?

19:29:10 SELINA MCMANUS.

19:29:15 >> HI.

19:29:16 CAN YOU HEAR ME?

19:29:18 >> Ms. Gauthier: YES.

19:29:18 >> HI.

19:29:22 I WAS JUST CALLING IN SUPPORT OF COUNCILMEMBER TERESA COX.

19:29:33 I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR CITY COUNCILS TO ALLOW THE FIRST BLACK COUNCILMEMBER IN 65 YEARS IN THE CITY 
19:29:35 OF FREMONT TO READ THE PROCLAMATION.

19:29:42 I SUPPORT HER IN CALLING OUT THE MAYOR AND THE CITY, AND ENOUGH WITH THE PERFORMATIVE ACT.

19:29:46 IF YOUR ONLY BLACK COUNCILMEMBER SAYS, HEY, THERE'S AN ISSUE, THEN YOU NEED TO HONOR THAT.

19:29:51 AND IT WAS PRETTY DISGUSTING TO SEE THOSE OF YOU SILENCING HER ON THIS ISSUE.

19:29:53 AND THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SAY.

19:29:53 THANK YOU.

19:30:09 >> Mayor Mei: NEXT SPEAKER IS NUMBER ENDING 748.

19:30:20 >> Ms. Gauthier: THE LAST DIGITS OF THE PHONE NUMBER 748, IF YOU'LL PLEASE UNMUTE.

19:30:21 >> THANK YOU.

19:30:22 MY NAME IS CAROLYN FOWLER.

19:30:30 I AM CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA DEMOCRATIC PARTY WOMEN'S CAUCUS AND ALSO A MEMBER OF ALPHA KAPPA ALPHA SORORITY, HOWEVER 
19:30:31 I'M SPEAKING PERSONALLY.

19:30:38 I HAVE TO TELL YOU HOW DISHEARTENED I AM TO HAVE HEARD THE CONVERSATION THAT YOU SAY THE FIRST BLACK AND SAY IT 
19:30:41 PROUDLY, YET DISRESPECT HER BY NOT ALLOWING.

19:30:43 THAT CAN BE MORE THAN ONE PROCLAMATION.

19:30:44 I'VE NEVER HEARD OF SUCH.

19:30:50 YOU WANT TO BE A CIVIL SERVANT, DIVERSITY IS THE KEY, THE KEY FOR CALIFORNIA.

19:30:51 THAT'S WHAT MAKES US STRONG.

19:30:56 I WORKED VERY HARD ON THE ASIAN ANTI-HATE PROJECT.

19:30:58 SO DID MANY OF THESE DIVINE 9 MEMBERS.

19:31:04 WHEN WE DON'T -- YOU INVITE PEOPLE TO THE DANCE BUT YOU DON'T LET THEM GET ON THE FLOOR.

19:31:05 THAT IS DISGUSTING.

19:31:38 AND FOR SOMEONE THAT IS SEEKING HIGHER OFFICE, YOU REALLY NEED TO -- I'M ASKING YOU TO RE-THINK THAT, AND YOU 
19:31:39 SHOULD.

19:31:41 SHE SHOULD HAVE BEEN ALLOWED TO SAY THAT.

19:31:44 SHE SHOULD HAVE BEEN ALLOWED TO SPEAK.

19:31:52 AND THE FACT THAT YOU ARE NOT SUPPORTING HER SAYS EVERYTHING I NEED TO KNOW ABOUT DIVERSITY IN YOUR CITY.

19:31:54 IT'S DISGRACEFUL.

19:31:54 THANK YOU.

19:32:05 >> Mayor Mei: TO CLARIFY, THERE'S SOME CONFUSION.

19:32:11 THE PROCLAMATIONS ARE USUALLY READ BY THE MAYOR, SO THIS IS NOT A DIFFERENCE THAN OTHER TIMES.

19:32:14 SO I'M A LITTLE CONFUSED BY  THAT, JUST TO CLARIFY.

19:32:21 >> Ms. Gauthier: THE NEXT SPEAKER IS BEATRICE.

19:32:22 >> Mayor Mei: BEATRICE?

19:32:27 >> YES.

19:32:36 I'M COMING ON BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN A GREAT SUPPORTER OF  MRS. COX AND LOOKING AT HER RECORD AND THE WORK 
19:32:47 THAT SHE'S DONE OVER THE DECADES IN  FREMONT, AND THE POSITION THAT SHE'S IN AS A LEADER IN THE COMMUNITY.

19:32:53 I FEEL THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE BEEN GIVEN THE RIGHT TO SAY -- HAVE THAT SAY.

19:32:56 AND I SEE YOU'RE PUTTING A TIMER ON ME.

19:33:04 AND I FEEL SHE SHOULD HAVE COME FORWARD AND GIVEN THE VOICE THAT SHE NEEDED TO DO THE WORK IN THE COMMUNITY AND TO 
19:33:06 PUT DIVERSITY IN FREMONT.

19:33:13 FREMONT HAS CHANGED A LOT, AND WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THE CHANGE THAT IS GOING ON, NOT ONLY IN FREMONT, BUT IN 
19:33:14 AMERICA AT THIS TIME.

19:33:23 SO I REALLY FEEL AS ONE LADY SAID, IT'S DISGUSTING THAT YOU DID NOT ANSWER AND RESPOND TO HER.

19:33:24 YOU IGNORED HER.

19:33:27 AND TO IGNORE SOMEONE SAYS A  LOT.

19:33:34 WE NEED TO COME TOGETHER BECAUSE AMERICA IS CHANGING, WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT.

19:33:38 THINGS ARE HAPPENING, AND PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO GO BACK TO WHERE WE USED TO BE.

19:33:43 WE CAN ONLY MOVE FORWARD AS A NATION.

19:33:47 AS KING SAID, IF WE DON'T COME TOGETHER, WE WILL PERISH AS FOOLS.

19:33:55 AND YOU SEE WHAT'S GOING ON NOW IN THE COUNTRY AND IN THE WORLD WITH PANDEMIC, CLIMATE CHANGE, PRAICIAL 
19:33:58  RACIAL INJUSTICE.

19:34:00 IT CAN ONLY GET WORSE IF WE DON'T COME TOGETHER.

19:34:04 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:34:08 NEXT SPEAKER IS MARIE HUGHES.

19:34:12 >> THANK YOU.

19:34:17 MY NAME IS MARIE HUGHES, AND I'M A LONG TIME RESIDENT OF FREMONT, CURRENTLY LIVING IN NILES.

19:34:20 I'M ALSO ON A LEADERSHIP TEAM OF FREMONT FOR EVERYONE.

19:34:25 OUR GROUP BELIEVES IN KEEPING FREMONT AN INCLUSIVE CITY WHERE WE LOOK OUT FOR OUR NEIGHBORS.

19:34:32 THAT'S WHY WE SUPPORT THE PROJECT HOMEKEY APPLICATION AS WELL AS THE SAFE PARKING  PROGRAM.

19:34:36 AND WE URGE ANYONE LISTENING TO THIS CALL WHO IS INTERESTED IN HELPING WITH THESE PROJECTS TO JOIN US AT OUR 
19:34:39 WEBSITE,  FREMONTFOREVERYONE.COM.

19:34:44 IN THE MEANTIME, I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT EVERY TIME THE CITY OF FREMONT TAKES STEPS TO ADDRESS OUR 
19:34:47 HOMELESSNESS  PROBLEM, PEOPLE PREDICT DIRE CONSEQUENCES.

19:34:50 THEN THE PROJECT HAPPENS AND THE CONSEQUENCES DON'T APPEAR.

19:34:54 THIS IS HAPPENING AGAIN WITH PROJECT HOMEKEY.

19:34:59 HOWEVER, GIVEN THE EXCELLENT TRACK RECORD OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE EXECUTING THE PROJECT, IT DOESN'T TAKE A CRYSTAL 
19:35:03 BALL TO SEE THAT THESE PREDICTED CONSEQUENCES WILL ALSO NOT HAPPEN.

19:35:10 I APPLAUD THE COUNCIL FOR APPROVING THIS PROJECT, AND YOUR UNANIMOUS DECISION TO APPLY FOR THE FUNDS HAS 
19:35:11 MADE ME PROUD TO BE A FREMONT RESIDENT.

19:35:12 THANK YOU.

19:35:14 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:35:18 THE NEXT SPEAKER IS RONNIE FORBES.

19:35:19 WELCOME, RONNIE.

19:35:25 >> HELLO.

19:35:27 CAN EVERYONE HEAR ME?

19:35:28 >> Mayor Mei: YES, WE CAN.

19:35:29 >> HI.

19:35:30 MY NAME IS RONNIE FORBES.

19:35:33 I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF ONE NATION DREAMMAKERS.

19:35:42 I'M A VETERAN FROM FOREIGN WARS AND HAVE BEEN RECENTLY APPOINTED AS A COMMISSIONER FOR THE ALAMEDA COUNTY 
19:35:42 VETERANS.

19:35:47 I AM A WAR VETERAN.

19:35:50 AND RIGHT NOW, WE'RE IN A WAR.

19:35:58 SO AFTER LISTENING TO THIS CONVERSATION TONIGHT OF WHICH I DON'T KNOW ALL THE DETAILS, I DO KNOW ONE THING, AND THAT 
19:36:06 IS THAT MAYOR LILY HAS HELPED ONE NATION DREAMMAKERS FULFILL THEIR MISSION WITH THE FOOD  INSECURITIES OF 
19:36:14 SO MANY PEOPLE IN THE ALAMEDA COUNTY AND THE FREMONT AREA, AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO BRANCHING OUT AND WORNGING 
19:36:20 WITH MORE EDEN  HOUSINGS, WE HAVE CONTRACTS WITH EDEN HOUSINGS, SO I WANT TO APPLAUD MAYOR LILY FOR THE 
19:36:23 WORK THAT SHE'S DONE TO ASSIST ONE NATION DREAMMAKERS.

19:36:23 THANK YOU, MAYOR.

19:36:26 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:36:32 THE NEXT SPEAKER IS DINA  DESHPANDE.

19:36:33 WELCOME.

19:36:42 >> HELLO.

19:36:45 IS THIS TIME FOR SPEAKING FOR HOMEKEY OR IS THAT SEPARATE?

19:36:48 >> Ms. Gauthier: YES, WE'RE UNDER ORAL COMMUNICATIONS AT THIS TIME.

19:36:56 >> SO JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT THE HOMEKEY PROJECT, WHILE INTENTIONS ARE GOOD BUT IT IS IN A NEIGHBORHOOD WITH 
19:37:04 A LOT OF CHILDREN AROUND AND THERE ARE DEFINITELY SAFETY CONCERNS AROUND THAT, AND I WOULD ASK THE COUNCIL TO 
19:37:07 RECONSIDER CONSIDERING THAT.

19:37:14 IT'S NOT LIKE RESIDENTS DO NOT WANT TO BE SUPPORTIVE OF THE HOMELESS POPULATION, BUT AT THE SAME TIME, 
19:37:20 THERE ARE CERTAIN CRITERIA THAT NEED TO BE  APPLIED, YOU CANNOT JUST PUT IT IN THE MIDDLE OF FAMILIES, ESPECIALLY 
19:37:29 THERE IS A TRACK RECORD AND I'M NOT GOING TO PRE-JUDGE NOBODY HERE, BUT THERE IS A TRACK RECORD HERE OF 
19:37:32 VIOLENCE BEING ACCOMPANIED WITH HOMELESS POPULATIONS AROUND  CITIES.

19:37:38 SO JUST SOMETHING FOR THE COUNCILMEN AND WOMEN TO  CONSIDER.

19:37:39 THANK YOU.

19:37:42 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:37:46 >> Ms. Gauthier: PEGGY RAHMAN?

19:37:49 >> THAT'S ME.

19:37:50 YES, THANK YOU.

19:37:52 HELLO.

19:37:54 THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR HAVING THIS TIME TO SPEAK.

19:37:57 MY NAME IS PEGGY RAHMAN.

19:38:05 AND I AM THE PRESIDENT OF AN ORGANIZATION CALLED THE NATIONAL ALLIANCE ON MENTAL ILLNESS, THE 
19:38:07 ALAMEDA COUNTY AFFILIATE.

19:38:15 I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR WORKING TOWARDS THIS HOMEKEY PROJECT WITH THE HOMELESS PEOPLE IN ALAMEDA COUNTY AND 
19:38:20 PARTICULARLY IN FREMONT, BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE I LIVE, REALLY NEED THIS  PROGRAM.

19:38:25 I KNOW SO MANY PEOPLE THAT HAVE MENTAL ILLNESS THAT ARE NOT A DANGER TO ANYBODY.

19:38:31 BUT I KNOW THAT FREQUENTLY THE COMMUNITY IS DANGEROUS TO THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE MENTAL ILLNESS AND THE 
19:38:32 PEOPLE THAT ARE  HOMELESS.

19:38:40 SO ONCE AGAIN, I REALLY APPLAUD YOU, MAYOR, AND THE ENTIRE CITY COUNCIL, AND I HOPE YOU KEEP GOING WITH THE 
19:38:41 HOMEKEY PROJECT.

19:38:41 THANK YOU.

19:38:43 >> Ms. Gauthier: THANK YOU.

19:38:47 NEXT SPEAKER IS LISA DANZ.

19:38:51 >> HI.

19:38:51 THANK YOU.

19:38:54 MY NAME IS LISA DANs.

19:38:58 I LIVE IN THE SUNDALE NEIGHBORHOOD AND I'M SHARING THIS STATEMENT ON BEHALF OF THE FREMONT FOR EVERYONE LEADERSHIP 
19:38:58 TEAM.

19:39:07 WE ARE STRONGLY IN FAVOR OF THE PROJECT HOMEKEY AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT AT MOTEL 6 OR WHEREVER YOU CHOOSE TO 
19:39:07 PLACE IT.

19:39:15 YOU MADE THE RIGHT DECISION TO VOTE UNANIMOUSLY IN FAVOR OF FUNDING AT THE CITY COUNCIL MEETING AND WE THANK YOU 
19:39:19 FOR YOUR VOTE TO BRING IN CRITICAL RESOURCES TO ADDRESS OUR  HOMELESSNESS CRISIS.

19:39:26 A RECENT STUDY FROM UCLA FOUND THAT PARTICIPATING IN HOUSING PROGRAMS REDUCES THE PROBABILITY OF COMMITTING 
19:39:33 A CRIME BY 80%, REDUCES THE NUMBER OF EMERGENCY ROOM VISITS BY 80%, AND INCREASES THE PROBABILITY OF 
19:39:35 EMPLOYMENT BY 24 PERCENTAGE POINTS.

19:39:38 THIS SAVES MONEY AND MAKES OUR COMMUNITY SAFER.

19:39:42 THE HOUSING FIRST MODEL IS THE BEST PRACTICE FOR A REASON.

19:39:46 FREMONT IS IN DIRE NEED OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING STOCK.

19:39:52 THIS WILL ADDRESS A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE NEED AS AN EXCELLENT STEP THAT WILL HELP ALL IN THE COMMUNITY.

19:39:53 >> Ms. Gauthier: THANK YOU.

19:39:57 THE NEXT SPEAKER IS MIS.

19:40:15 >> Mayor Mei: COULD YOU PLEASE UNMUTE YOUR MIC, MIS?

19:40:25 >> Ms. Gauthier: WE'LL MOVE ON TO LEI.

19:40:32 >> HELLO, DEAR COUNCILMEMBERS.

19:40:35 I AM A WARM SPRINGS RESIDENT.

19:40:41 I'M CALLING TO EXPRESS MY STRONG OPPONENT TO THIS HOMEKEY PROJECT.

19:40:46 IT'S NOT BECAUSE THAT I AM SELFISH, LIKE MANY PEOPLE MIGHT THINK.

19:40:53 I THINK THIS IS NOT THE RIGHT SOLUTION TO THE PROJECT, TO THE PROBLEM THAT WE ARE FACING.

19:41:02 AND WE HAVE A LOT OF SUPPORTERS, BUT PLEASE GO AND CHECK THE SPOT AND LISTEN TO THE WARM SPRINGS RESIDENTS 
19:41:10 AND CHECK THEIR SURROUNDING NEIGHBORHOOD FOR THAT PROJECT SITE AND YOU WILL KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

19:41:20 ANOTHER QUESTION IS THANKS FOR THE Q & A APPEARED UNDER CITY WEBSITE AFTER THE PROJECT HAS BEEN -- I'M WONDERING 
19:41:23 HOW PEOPLE CAN KNOW THAT IF WE ARE NOT HERE IN THE MEETING TODAY.

19:41:24 THANK YOU.

19:41:31 PLEASE, I URGE YOU TO STOP THAT PROJECT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE UNTIL FURTHER COMMUNITY INPUT.

19:41:31 THANK YOU.

19:41:34 >> Ms. Gauthier: THANK YOU.

19:41:35 WE'LL GO BACK TO MIS.

19:41:39 YOU NEED TO UNMUTE YOUR MICROPHONE, PLEASE.

19:41:44 >> HI.

19:41:48 >> Mayor Mei: HI.

19:41:49 >> WELL, GREAT.

19:41:49 HI.

19:42:03 HOMEKEY -- [INAUDIBLE]

19:42:04 >> Mayor Mei: DO YOU WANT TO TRANSLATE?

19:42:23 [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]

19:42:52 >> Ms. Gauthier: WE CAN ACCEPT THE TRANSLATION.

19:42:54 >> Councilmember Shao: MAYOR, THIS IS THE TRANSLATION.

19:43:04 YES, LAST WEEK I WAS IN THE FREMONT PARENT WE CHAT GROUP AND I LEARNED THAT ON JANUARY 18TH, THE FREMONT CITY 
19:43:14 COUNCIL MADE THE DECISION TO APPLY FOR $40 MILLION OF FUNDS TO CONVERT MOTEL 6 INTO PERMANENT AFFORDABLE HOUSING 
19:43:23 RESIDENCE FOR 156 HOMELESS PEOPLE, AMONG WHICH 10% SUFFERED MENTAL ILLNESS.

19:43:24 I WAS VERY SURPRISED.

19:43:29 I WAS VERY SURPRISED THAT SUCH A BIG DECISION WAS MADE WITHOUT INFORMING US.

19:43:31 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:43:39 >> Ms. Gauthier: LAVERE FOSTER.

19:43:42 >> HI, I REPRESENT AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY SERVICE AGENCY.

19:43:50 AS WE HONOR BLACK HISTORY MONTH, WE NEED TO ACKNOWLEDGE OHLONE COLLEGE, OUR HBCUs, THE DIVINE 9 BECAUSE OF 
19:43:51 THEIR IMPACT ON OUR COMMUNITIES.

19:43:57 THEY PLAY A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN UNITING OUR PEOPLE AND FIGHTING AGAINST THE INJUSTICE WE FACE EVERY DAY.

19:44:01 WE SUPPORT TERESA COX, HER PROCLAMATION AND HER CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE COMMUNITY.

19:44:06 I'M ALSO VERY DISGUSTED BY THE COUNCIL FOR TRYING TO SILENCE COUNCILMEMBER COX.

19:44:07 DO BETTER.

19:44:07 THANK YOU.

19:44:10 >> Ms. Gauthier: THANK YOU.

19:44:14 MY APOLOGIES, MR. FOSTER, FOR MESSING UP YOUR NAME.

19:44:20 REBEKAH MELESSE.

19:44:24 >> CAN YOU HEAR ME?

19:44:26 >> Ms. Gauthier: YES.

19:44:27 >> HI.

19:44:30 I AM A LONG-TIME FREMONT RESIDENT.

19:44:35 I WAS BORN IN WASHINGTON HOSPITAL, I WENT TO ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, HIGH SCHOOL AND COLLEGE IN FREMONT.

19:44:39 I AM ALSO AFRICAN AMERICAN.

19:44:49 I REMEMBER IN 2020, WHEN WE WERE DOING -- WHEN THERE WERE  PROTESTS, LILY MEI REFUSED TO TAKE A KNEE.

19:44:53 AND I DEFENDED HER BECAUSE I BELIEVED WHAT HER REASONING WAS TRUE.

19:45:02 SHE SAID THAT SHE -- HER FAITH WOULDN'T ALLOW HER TO TAKE A KNEE, BUT I THOUGHT THAT SHE WOULD DO BETTER, AND 
19:45:06 PROCLAIM BLACK HISTORY MONTH IN FEBRUARY.

19:45:07 THIS IS SOMETHING VERY BASIC.

19:45:10 WE'RE NOT EVEN ASKING FOR MONEY AT THIS POINT.

19:45:18 SO I THINK THAT TERESA COX IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT, AND I'M VERY SADDENED THAT PEOPLE TRIED TO SHAME 
19:45:19 HER AND TO SILENCE HER AT THIS TIME.

19:45:23 PLEASE RECONSIDER AND PROCLAIM FEBRUARY AS BLACK HISTORY MONTH.

19:45:24 THANK YOU.

19:45:28 >> Ms. Gauthier: THANK YOU.

19:45:31 THE NEXT SPEAKER IS ZINA SLAUGHTER.

19:45:41 ZINA, PLEASE UNMUTE.

19:45:43 >> GOOD EVENING, GOOD EVENING.

19:45:50 I AM THE PRESIDENT OF THE RHO DELTA OWE MAY KA ALPHA SORORITY INCORPORATED.

19:45:58 THE MEMBERS OF OUR CHAPTER AND OUR FOUNDATION STAND IN SUPPORT OF OUR SORORITY SISTER, COUNCILMEMBER TERESA 
19:46:02 COX, AND THE 3.1% BLACK RESIDENTS OF THE CITY OF FREMONT.

19:46:09 AND ASK THAT YOU RECOGNIZE THE PROCLAMATION SUBMITTED BY COUNCILMEMBER TERESA COX THAT NOT ONLY 
19:46:16 RECOGNIZES BLACK HISTORY MONTH, BUT ALSO OHLONE COLLEGE, THE HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES, AND 
19:46:20 THE DIVINE 9'S CONTRIBUTION TO THIS AND AMERICAN HISTORY.

19:46:27 THANK YOU, AND CITY OF FREMONT, PLEASE DO BETTER IN RESPECTING YOUR COUNCILMEMBERS AND RESPECTING YOUR 
19:46:28 RESIDENTS.

19:46:29 THANK YOU.

19:46:33 >> Ms. Gauthier: THANK YOU.

19:46:37 THE NEXT SPEAKER, FIVE DIGITS ARE 16502.

19:46:43 PLEASE UNMUTE.

19:46:47 16502.

19:47:02 >> HELLO.

19:47:03 >> Ms. Gauthier: YES.

19:47:04 YOUR TIME IS STARTING.

19:47:05 >> OKAY, HELLO.

19:47:17 THIS IS A PROUD U.S. ARMY HONORABLE MILITARY VETERAN, PAST MEMBER BOARD OF DIRECTORS FOR THE CHAMBER ALAMEDA 
19:47:18 COUNTY AND THE CIVIL RIGHTS ORGANIZATION.

19:47:30 I SUPPORT, YOU KNOW, ALL LEADERSHIP HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND AMERICA, USA, AND I SUPPORT CITY COUNCIL TERESA COX, 
19:47:38 AND THIS ISSUE ABOUT THE BLACK HISTORY PROCLAMATION, YOU KNOW, I REALLY BELIEVE THAT EACH OF THE CITY COUNCIL 
19:47:43 SHOULD SUPPORT HER, YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT A SPECIAL INTEREST FOR HER.

19:47:45 IT'S FOR THE COMMUNITY.

19:47:54 BUT PLEASE, I WOULD RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THAT EVERYONE ON THE CITY COUNCIL WILL SUPPORT TERESA COX, JUST 
19:47:59 LIKE PRESIDENT OBAMA, PAST PRESIDENT OBAMA SAY, DIVERSITY IS THE KEY TO HAVING SUCCESS IN ANYTHING IN LIFE.

19:48:00 THANK YOU.

19:48:03 >> Ms. Gauthier: THANK YOU.

19:48:08 THE NEXT SPEAKER IS LUCY ZHANG.

19:48:16 >> HELLO.

19:48:17 >> Ms. Gauthier: YES, YOUR TIMER IS STARTING.

19:48:18 >> HI.

19:48:29 DEAR COUNCILMEMBERS, FIRST I WANT TO REMIND THE CITY COUNCIL THAT THE STATE HOMEKEY FUNDING PROJECT, -- YOU CAN -- 
19:48:36 YOU HAVE MANY OPTION, YOU CAN BUILD NEW, YOU CAN CONVERT RESIDENTIAL  NON-RESIDENTIAL TO RESIDENTIAL, CAN 
19:48:40 YOU -- IT'S NOT THE ONLY OPTION TO BUY MOTEL 6.

19:48:46 SECOND, I WANT TO CLARIFY OUR OPPOSITION FOR HOMELESS -- UNDERSTANDING.

19:48:49 THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF HOMELESS PEOPLE.

19:48:53 THE SOLUTION FOR HOMELESS CANNOT BE ONE SIZE FITS ALL.

19:49:06 SO I THINK THE MENTAL ILL HOMELESS PERSON, THEY NEED SPECIAL CARE, AND SUBSTANCE ADDICTION, THEY SHOULD -- 
19:49:12 SPECIALIZED -- NOT A MOTEL SIX, MOST VULNERABLE POPULATION.

19:49:18 THEY SHOULD BE TREATING IT DIFFERENTLY AND THEY SHOULDN'T BE DUMPED TOGETHER.

19:49:18 THAT'S MY OPINION.

19:49:26 >> GULU GULU IS NEXT.

19:49:40 YOUR TIMER IS STARTING.

19:49:41 >> OKAY.

19:49:49 I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT ARE THE POSSIBLE ALTERNATIVE APPROACH TO THE HOMELESS ISSUES.

19:49:59 WE SHOULD INVEST MORE IN RESOURCES INTO OUR FOSTER CARE SYSTEM SO THE KIDS ARE LESS  LIKELY HOMELESS.

19:50:07 WE SHOULD BUILD A SUPPORT NETWORK AND TREAT SUBSTANCE ABUSE PATIENT IN A FACILITY WITH PROPER CARE AND 
19:50:08 GUIDANCE, NOT HOTELS.

19:50:12 WE SHOULD PREVENT THE WORKING POOR FROM BEING HOMELESS.

19:50:15 NOBODY WHO IS WILLING TO WORK SHOULD BE HOMELESS.

19:50:18 FREMONT HAS A HUGE LABOR SHORTAGE.

19:50:20 OPPORTUNITY OUT THERE FOR  EVERYONE.

19:50:24 WE SHOULD DISCOURAGE PEOPLE WITH THE ABILITY TO WORK.

19:50:31 FROM TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE SYSTEM, THIS APPROACH IS NOT EASY BY ANY MEANS, BUT WE BELIEVE THIS IS THE 
19:50:33 RIGHT DIRECTION WE WANT TO SEE ALTERNATIVE.

19:50:39 >> Ms. Gauthier: THANK YOU.

19:50:42 THE NEXT SPEAKER IS WENDY LI.

19:50:45 >> HEY, Y'ALL.

19:50:47 I'M A RESIDENT OF WARM SPRINGS.

19:50:51 I WOULD LIKE TO LET THE CITY KNOW THAT WE'RE STRONGLY AGAINST THE HOMEKEY PROJECT.

19:50:54 BECAUSE IT'S NOT SAFE FOR THE RESIDENTS, ESPECIALLY THE CHILDREN.

19:51:03 THIS NEIGHBORHOOD IS ALREADY GOING THROUGH STRESS AND  ANXIETY, SO THIS NEIGHBORHOOD HAS BREAK INS, ROBBERIES, 
19:51:08 PROBLEMS ALMOST EVERY SINGLE  DAY.

19:51:14 SOME WOULD SAY IT'S NOT CAUSED BY HOMELESS BUT AN UNSTABLE SITUATION EXISTS, AND IT'S INCREASING EVERY 
19:51:25 SINGLE DAY, ANTDZ WE HAVE TO ADMIT MANY TRAGEDIES ARE DIRECTLY RELATED TO HOMELESS ISSUE.

19:51:32 IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE THE TRAUMA AND PAIN THOSE FAMILIES WENT THROUGH, SO BEFORE INTRODUCING MORE UNSTABLE 
19:51:36 FACTORS -- WHO IS SPEAKING RESPONSIBLE FOR THOSE VICTIMS?

19:51:43 I GUESS THOSE PEOPLE ARE ASSUMING THERE'S NO CONSEQUENCE, SO WE ACCEPT NO ASSUMPTION ABOUT SAFETY FOR 
19:51:45 CHILDREN, SO WE FEEL FOR THE VICTIMS.

19:51:50 >> Ms. Gauthier: THE NEXT SPEAKER IS FAYE.

19:52:00 >> THE RESIDENTS NOT ONLY DISAGREE WITH THE PROJECT LOCATION BUT ALSO STRONGLY AGREE WITH THE APPROACH.

19:52:03 WE BELIEVE ALL HOMELESS PEOPLE NEED TO BE HELPED AND CARED FOR BUT NOT THIS WAY.

19:52:10 WE ASK THAT THE GOVERNMENT SEEKS AN ALTERNATIVE TRAUMA-INFORMED CARE LONG-TERM APPROACH, WHICH DOES NOT 
19:52:12 CORRAL ALL HOMELESS PEOPLE INTO THE SAME FACILITY.

19:52:18 TO DUMP THE WORKING POOR AND THE MENTALLY ILL INTO ONE FACILITY NEAR KIDS AND SENIORS IS NOT THE SOLUTION.

19:52:24 WE THINK THERE ARE OTHER BETTER LONG-TERM ALTERNATIVES, AND WE UNDERSTAND THE FINAL GOAL COULD NOT BE 
19:52:28 ACCOMPLISHED WITHIN ANY ELECTED OFFICIAL'S LIMITED  TERMS.

19:52:35 WE UNDERSTAND THAT HOUSING THE HOMELESS FIRST IS THE EASIEST SHORT TERM FIRST STEP, HOWEVER, WE ALL BELIEVE THESE 
19:52:43 TYPES OF HOMELESS HOTELS WILL BECOME THE PERMANENT SOLUTION THAT BOUND TO FAIL, AND MOST ELECTED OFFICIALS ARE 
19:52:46 NOT IN THE OFFICE TO BE ACCOUNTABLE FOR THOSE CONSEQUENCES.

19:52:47 WHO ENDS UP FOOTING THE BILL?

19:52:48 IT'S THE RESIDENTS.

19:52:53 WE CALL FOR A COMMITTEE THAT IS SET UP TO ADDRESS THIS LONG TERM HOMELESS ISSUE, AND KEEPS THE ELECTED OFFICIALS 
19:52:55 ON THE RIGHT PATH.

19:52:57 >> Ms. Gauthier: THANK YOU.

19:52:59 THE NEXT SPEAKER IS ANNIE CHANG.

19:53:07 >> HELLO, CAN YOU HEAR ME?

19:53:08 >> YES.

19:53:13 >> DEAR COUNCILMEMBERS, THIS IS ANNIE, A SIX-YEAR RESIDENT IN THE WARM SPRINGS AREA WITH TWO YOUNG KIDS GOING 
19:53:15 TO THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS.

19:53:25 THE FACILITY IS ONLY .6 MILES AWAY FROM THE SCHOOLS OUR CHILDREN GO, BUT SINCE THIS SELECTION CRITERIA DOES NOT 
19:53:32 INCLUDE PEOPLE WITH MENTAL ILLNESS, WHICH MAY CAUSE A GREAT A STRESS TO PARENTS AND FAMILIES WITH YOUNG KIDS, 
19:53:38 FOR EXAMPLE, THE SERVICE SHELTER PROJECT SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED THE CRIME RATE IN THAT AREA AND THE 911 
19:53:39 CALLS.

19:53:43 S TO THE CITY HAVE A CONCRETE PLAN ON HOW YOU WILL HANDLE THESE RISKS?

19:53:47 IF SO, WHEN WILL YOU INFORM THE COMMUNITY THAT RIM PACTED?

19:53:54 SO I'M STRONGLY AGAINST THIS PROJECT WITHOUT ANY EVIDENCE SHOWING THE PROJECT WON'T BRING ANY MENTAL ILLNESS 
19:53:56 PEOPLE OR EVEN DRUG USERS TO OUR COMMUNITY.

19:53:58 WE NEED TO PROTECT THE SAFETY FOR OUR KIDS.

19:53:59 THANK YOU.

19:54:00 >> Ms. Gauthier: THANK YOU.

19:54:07 THE NEXT SPEAKER IS SARA PRADA.

19:54:09 >> HELLO, CAN YOU HEAR ME?

19:54:10 ?

19:54:12 >> Ms. Gauthier: YES, YOUR TIMER IS STARTING.

19:54:12 >>LY.

19:54:24 MY NAME IS TRUSTEE PRADA FROM HAYWARD UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT BUT TONIGHT I AM CALLING IN AS  A -- SISTER FOR 
19:54:25 COUNCILWOMAN  COX.

19:54:35 WHAT I WITNESSED THIS EVENING WAS COMPLETE DISRESPECT, AND I JUST WANT TO SAY, IT'S SHAMEFUL TO SEE THE CITY 
19:54:42 -- THE FREMONT CITY COUNCIL ACT LIKE THIS TOWARDS YOUR ONLY BLACK  COUNCILWOMAN, AND I UNDERSTAND HOW 
19:54:47 THAT FEELS AS A BLACK WOMAN IN POLITICS, AND YOU NEED TO DO BETTER.

19:54:59 AND I REALLY HOPE THAT THE MAYOR CAN REALLY TO SOME DEEP THOUGHT AND RECONCILIATION, ESPECIALLY IF SOMEONE 
19:55:00 WANTS TO GO FOR HIGHER OFFICE.

19:55:03 YOU NEED TO RESPECT A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE BLACK COMMUNITY ON YOUR COUNCIL.

19:55:04 IT'S VERY IMPORTANT.

19:55:08 AND I HOPE THAT YOU REALLY, REALLY ALL THINK ABOUT THAT.

19:55:10 SAW SUE THANK YOU.

19:55:12 THE NEXT SPEAKER IS CHUNG.

19:55:24 CHUNG, YOUR TIMER IS STARTING.

19:55:26 >> CAN YOU HEAR ME?

19:55:26 YES?

19:55:27 ?

19:55:28 >> Ms. Gauthier: YES, GO AHEAD.

19:55:28 >> GOOD.

19:55:35 SO IN THE U.S. DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE, IT SAYS WE HOLD THESE TRUTHS TO BE SELF-EVIDENT.

19:55:38 NOT ALL MEN ARE CREATED EQUAL.

19:55:42 THEY'RE ENDOWED BY THE CREATOR WITH CERTAIN INALIENABLE RIGHTS.

19:55:45 AMONG THESE ARE LIFE, LIBERTY, AND THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS.

19:55:59 THAT -- GOVERNMENT ARE INSTITUTED AMONG MEN, DERIVING THE JUST POWER FROM THE CONSENT OF THE GOVERNMENT.

19:56:04 ONCE AGAIN, DERIVING CONSENT OF THE GOVERNMENT.

19:56:07 YOU SHOULD GET CONSENT FROM THE PEOPLE.

19:56:12 DID YOU LEARN ANYTHING FROM THE HRC SAGA?

19:56:16 PLEASE STOP THE PROJECT TO WORK WITH THE COMMUNITY ON A BETTER SOLUTION.

19:56:17 THANK YOU.

19:56:18 >> Ms. Gauthier: THANK YOU.

19:56:29 THE NEXT SPEAKER IS MILAN  BALINTON.

19:56:30 >> THANK YOU.

19:56:34 I REPRESENT THE AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY SERVICE AGENCY.

19:56:39 AS WE HONOR BLACK HISTORY MONTH, WE NEED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WHEN YOU HEAR A BLACK WOMAN SPEAKING, YOU MUST LISTEN.

19:56:48 APPARENTLY, COUNCILMEMBER COX BROUGHT FORWARD TO THE ATTENTION OF THE PUBLIC THAT SHE SENT AN EMAIL AND DIDN'T GET 
19:56:51 A RESPONSE TO WORK ON A PROCLAMATION FOR BLACK HISTORY.

19:56:55 WHICH MEANS THAT SHE WAS  IGNORED, WHICH MEANS THAT BLACK PEOPLE WERE IGNORED.

19:56:59 AND AS YOU HEARD ANOTHER BLACK WOMAN SAY, SHE HAS BEEN IGNORED.

19:57:06 IT IS IMPORTANT FOR US AS THE PUBLIC TO SEE HER HEARD, AND HOW SOMETHING WAS WRITTEN ON OUR COMMUNITY'S BEHALF.

19:57:11 SO IT IS BEST THAT THE MAYOR AND THE OTHER COUNCILMEMBER THAT WAS TRYING TO CUT HER OFF GET WITH HER AFTER THIS 
19:57:12 MEETING.

19:57:17 IF YOU TRULY KNOW THE NAMES OF ALL THE BLACK PEOPLE THAT YOU'VE HIRED, YOU REALLY NEED TO HEAR FROM THE BLACK 
19:57:23 WOMAN THAT IS AN ELECTED OFFICIAL THAT HAS EARNED HER RIGHT TO BE HEARD, RESPONDED TO, AND ACKNOWLEDGED.

19:57:30 >> Ms. Gauthier: THANK YOU.

19:57:33 THE NEXT SPEAKER IS STEVE CHIU.

19:57:38 >> HI.

19:57:40 CAN YOU HEAR ME?

19:57:40 >> Ms. Gauthier: YES.

19:57:41 YOUR TIME IS STARTING.

19:57:41 >> YES.

19:57:42 OKAY.

19:57:46 SO I'M ALSO A RESIDENT IN THE WARM SPRINGS DISTRICT.

19:57:51 I'M HERE TO STRONGLY OPPOSE THE HOMEKEY HOMELESS CENTER PROJECT.

19:57:58 SO MY QUESTION FOR THE CITY IS THAT I WANT TO KNOW IF THE CITY HAS DONE ANY RESEARCH ON THE IMPACT TO LOCAL 
19:58:08 RESIDENTS AFTER INJECTING SUCH A LARGE SCALE FROM THIS CENTER IN THE MIDDLE OF -- MIDDLE CLASS RESIDENTS AREA, IS 
19:58:10 IT GOING TO HAVE NEGATIVE IMPACT?

19:58:15 IS IT GOING TO ADDRESS THE  UNDERLYING ISSUES LEADING TO HOMELESS PROBLEMS?

19:58:19 IF YOU HAVE DONE IT, I THINK THE PUBLIC HAS THE RIGHT TO SEE THE CASE STUDIES.

19:58:23 AND THE DATA THAT CAN SUPPORT YOUR DECISION.

19:58:34 IF NOT, ARE YOU PLANNING TO DO SUCH STUDIES BEFORE SPENDING $40 BILLION TAXPAYERS' MONEY ON THIS BIG PROJECT?

19:58:44 ALSO, I THINK NONE OF THE SUPPORTERS THAT SUPPORTS HOMEKEY PROJECTS TODAY, [INAUDIBLE]

19:58:44 >> Ms. Gauthier: TIME IS UP.

19:58:44 THANK YOU.

19:58:53 THE NEXT SPEAKER IS ERIKA  ALBURY.

19:58:55 >> THANK YOU FOR RECOGNIZING ME.

19:59:03 I AM A RESIDENT OF FREMONT AND I AM PROUD MEMBER OF ALPHA KAPPA ALPHA SORORITY INCORPORATED.

19:59:09 I AM IN FULL SUPPORT OF MY SORORITY SISTER COUNCILMEMBER TERESA COX.

19:59:11 AS WELL AS HER PROCLAMATION.

19:59:18 I AM ABSOLUTELY DISAPPOINTED IN THE LACK OF RESPONSE TO HER PROGRESS LAMATION SUBMISSION.

19:59:23  PROCLAMATION AND SUBMISSION.

19:59:29 I AM MORE THAN DISGUSTED AND ANGERED BY THE REACTIONS BY OTHER COUNCILMEMBERS AS SHE WAS TRYING TO SPEAK.

19:59:36 I DON'T KNOW IF I'M DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE THESE ARE ELECTED OFFICIALS OR THAT SHE WAS ATTACKED BY A MALE 
19:59:36 COLLEAGUE ON A PUBLIC FORUM.

19:59:45 AS A RESIDENT OF FREMONT, I  EX-EXPECT BETTER OF THESE ELECTED OFFICIALS.

19:59:46 THANK YOU.

19:59:49 >> Ms. Gauthier: THANK YOU, MAYOR.

19:59:51 THAT IS THE END OF OUR 30 MINUTES FOR PUBLIC COMMENT.

19:59:53 PUBLIC COMMUNICATIONS.

19:59:57 SO WE'LL GO ON TO THE NEXT ITEM ON THE AGENDA.

19:59:59 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

20:00:06 AND AT THIS TIME, WE'RE GOING TO GO BACK TO THE AGENDA ITEMS, AND RESUME PUBLIC COMMENT AFTER.

20:00:14 AND THAT BEGINS WITH --

20:00:17 >> Ms. Gauthier: MR. LARSEN HAS A PRESENTATION.

20:00:21 >> Mayor Mei: IF YOU COULD BRING UP THE PRESENTATION, THAT WOULD BE GREAT.

20:00:27 AND WE MIGHT HAVE TO TAKE A BREAK AFTER THE PRESENTATION.

20:00:29 THANK YOU.

20:00:34 >> Mr. Larsen: GOOD EVENING, MAYOR MEI.

20:00:39 HANS LARSEN, PUBLIC WORKS DIRECTOR, AND JUST WANTED TO CHECK THAT YOU CAN SEE MY SCREEN OKAY?

20:00:41 GREAT.

20:00:43 SO --

20:00:43 >> Vice Mayor Salwan: EXCUSE ME.

20:00:46 MR. LARSEN, SORRY.

20:00:51 I'M GOING TO RECUSE ON THIS ITEM SINCE THIS IS RIGHT ACROSS FROM WHERE MY OFFICE IS.

20:00:51 THANK YOU.

20:00:53 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

20:00:54 >> Ms. Gauthier: SO NOTED.

20:00:55 THANK YOU.

20:01:00 >> Mayor Mei: PLEASE CONTINUE, MR. LARSEN.

20:01:00 >> Mr. Larsen: THANK YOU.

20:01:08 SO MAYOR MEI AND MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL, FOR THIS AGENDA ITEM, WE ARE SEEKING COUNCIL'S CONCURRENCE ON THE 
20:01:13 GENERAL STREET DESIGN DIRECTION FOR THE CENTERVILLE COMPLETE STREETS PROJECT.

20:01:21 SPECIFICALLY, WE ARE FOCUSED ON THE SEGMENT OF FREMONT BOULEVARD FROM THORNTON TO PARISH, ILLUSTRATED ON THE 
20:01:21 SLIDE.

20:01:29 THIS IS THE MAIN STREET AREA OF CENTERVILLE, AND IN THE VICINITY OF THE CENTERVILLE TRAIN DEPOT.

20:01:39 AFTER CONSIDERABLE STUDY AND COMMUNITY OUTREACH, STAFF IS RECOMMENDING TO RETAIN FOUR LANES ON FREMONT BOULEVARD.

20:01:41 THAT'S TWO LANES IN EACH DIRECTION.

20:01:47 I HAVE A BRIEF PRESENTATION FOR YOU TO DESCRIBE THE BACKGROUND OF THE PROJECT, AND THE BASIS FOR THE 
20:01:48 RECOMMENDED DIRECTION.

20:01:59 SO IN WAY OF BACKGROUND, THE OPPORTUNITY TO EVEN CONSIDER THIS PROJECT IS ENABLED BY A RECENT 
20:02:07 RELINQUISHMENT OF STATE ROUTE 84 FROM THE STATE AND CALTRANS TO THE CITY OF FREMONT, WHICH HAS ENABLED THE CITY TO 
20:02:10 HAVE LOCAL CONTROL OVER THE DESIGN OF THE STREET.

20:02:19 WE WERE FORTUNATE TO HAVE RECEIVED A $7.7 MILLION COMPLETE STREETS GRANT OF FEDERAL FUNDS THROUGH THE ALAMEDA 
20:02:26 COUNTY TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION, AND THIS WAS GRANTED TO US PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF THE LOCATION OF THE 
20:02:35 CENTERVILLE TRAIN STATION, OUR COMMITMENT TO SUPPORT TRANSIT ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT IN THE  AREA, AND TO 
20:02:37 FACILITATE IMPROVEMENTS IN THE CENTERVILLE TOWN CENTER.

20:02:46 IT'S NOTED THAT WE DO HAVE A DEADLINE ON THIS GRANT THAT REQUIRES THE PROJECT TO BE READY FOR CONSTRUCTION 
20:02:53 BY JANUARY OF 2023, SO A LITTLE LESS THAN A YEAR FROM NOW, AND SO IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE ESTABLISH A 
20:02:58 DIRECTION FOR THE PROJECT SO THAT WE CAN GET IT READY AND MEET THE GRANT DEADLINES.

20:03:07 I JUST WANT TO NOTE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE COMPLETE STREETS AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT COMPLETE STREETS ARE NOW A POLICY 
20:03:09 AT ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT.

20:03:18 THE COUNCIL HAS APPROVED A COMPLETE STREETS POLICY, AS HAS OUR REGION, STATE, AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, AND 
20:03:27 COMPLETE STREETS POLICIES ARE DESIGNED TO REALLY TRANSFORM STREETS FROM WHAT HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN A FOCUS ON 
20:03:40 MOVING CARS EFFICIENTLY AND UNDER COMPLETE STREETS, THE DIRECTION IS TO ACCOMMODATE ALL USERS IN THE STREET 
20:03:46 SYSTEM, SO PEOPLE WHO WALK, BIKE, TAKE TRANSIT, AND PEOPLE WHO DRIVE, TO PROMOTE SAFETY, COMFORT AND 
20:03:50 CONVENIENCE FOR ALL MODES, FOR ALL AGES AND ABILITIES.

20:03:56 WHEN YOU MAKE A TRANSFORMATION OF A STREET TO A MORE COMPLETE STREET, IT'S RECOGNIZED THAT THIS IS DOAFL A 
20:04:04  DEFINITELY A BALANCING ACT, AND THERE'S TRADEOFFS TO BE MADE IN TERMS OF SORT OF VEHICLE CAPACITY AND SPEED, 
20:04:12 PARKING, ENHANCING SAFETY COMFORT FOR ALL TRAVEL MODES, SO IT'S SOMETHING IN WHICH YOU CONSIDER ALL DIFFERENT 
20:04:18 VARIABLES, AND THEN WORK TOWARDS PROVIDING A SYSTEM THAT SERVES ALL USERS.

20:04:29 SO FREMONT HAS ADOPTED A LOT OF POLICIES SUPPORTING COMPLETE STREETS, AND PLANS SPECIFICALLY IN THE 
20:04:30 CENTERVILLE AREA.

20:04:32 THEY'RE LISTED HERE ON THE  SLIDE.

20:04:39 BUT THERE'S A COMMON THEME THAT RUNS THROUGH THOSE, AND GENERALLY IT'S SUPPORTIVE OF COMPLETE STREETS, 
20:04:47 ENHANCING SAFETY, MAKING FREMONT BOULEVARD MORE PEDESTRIAN-FRIENDLY, DEVELOPING A MAIN STREET, AND CREATING 
20:04:52 THE TOWN CENTER OF CENTERVILLE AS A VIBRANT AND IDENTIFIABLE DISTRICT.

20:05:04 WITH THE BENEFIT OF OUR CONSULTANT, PLACEWORKS, WE ENGAGED THE COMMUNITY INTO AN EXTENSIVE PROCESS THAT SPANNED 
20:05:15 OVER TWO YEARS, THAT INCLUDED FOUR COMMUNITY MEETINGS TO SURVEYS, FOCUS GROUPS, AND THEN WE ACTUALLY PUT IN 
20:05:25 PLACE AN ADMINISTRATION PROJECT TO ACTUALLY TEST THE OPERATIONS OF ONE OF THE STREET DESIGN SCENARIOS.

20:05:33 THROUGH THIS EFFORT, WE'RE MOSTLY FOCUSED ON THREE DIFFERENT TYPES OF SCENARIOS FOR THE STREET.

20:05:42 SO ONE IS TO RETAIN IT AS A FOUR-LANE STREET, AND THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS SUPPORTED BY MANY FREMONT 
20:05:51 RESIDENTS, WHO FELT FREMONT BOULEVARD IS A VERY IMPORTANT THOROUGHFARE AND NEEDS TO RETAIN THAT FUNCTION TO 
20:05:57 ACCOMMODATE SO THE IMPORTANT MOVEMENT OF TRAVEL AND ACCESS TO VARIOUS USES IN THE AREA, INCLUDING SCHOOLS.

20:06:08 WE HEARD ADVOCACY FROM THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY THAT WANTED TO REALLY REDUCE THE SIZE OF FREMONT BOULEVARD IN THE 
20:06:16 MAIN STREET AREA, AND TRIED TO TRANSFORM TO SOMETHING LIKE WHAT LIVERMORE HAS DONE IN THEIR MAIN 
20:06:21 STREET AREA, AND THERE ARE OTHER EXAMPLES AROUND THE BAY AREA.

20:06:30 MOUNTAIN VIEW, AND OTHERS THAT HAVE REFOCUSED THEIR STREETS, TAKEN AWAY LANES AND CREATED A VERY VIBRANT 
20:06:36 ENVIRONMENT THAT SUPPORTS OUTDOOR RESTAURANT  DIEING AND COMMUNITY GATHERING.

20:06:45 SO THERE'S BEEN AN INTEREST IN DOING THAT, ADDING DIAGONAL PARKING, BUT CONSIDERING SORT OF THE USE OF THE 
20:06:52 STREET FOR VEHICLE TRAVEL, WE RECOGNIZED THERE WOULD BE CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH DOING THAT.

20:07:02 SO WHAT WE DID WAS FORMULATE AN IDEA TO TEST OUT KIND OF A MIDDLE SCENARIO OF THREE LANES, WHERE WE REMOVED ONE LANE 
20:07:12 IN THE NORTHBOUND DIRECTION, AND THAT WAS SELECTED BECAUSE IT HAS SORT OF LESS USE FOR ACCESS TO  SCHOOLS, 
20:07:19 PRIMARILY BECAUSE SCHOOL ACCESS IS DONL NANTLY IN THE SOUTHBOUND DIRECTION WITH THE PEAK COMMUNITY, AND THEN IN 
20:07:27 THE EVENING AND AFTERNOON, THE SCHOOL AND COMMUTE TRAFFIC IS SPLIT OVER A LARGER TIME PERIOD IN THE NORTHBOUND.

20:07:33 SO IF WE'RE GOING TO REDUCE A LANE, IT WAS FELT THAT REDUCING A LANE IN THE NORTHBOUND DIRECTION WOULD BE MOST 
20:07:34 VIABLE.

20:07:42 THERE WAS ALSO LOTS OF TALK ABOUT DIFFERENT OPTIONS FOR PARKING, OUTDOOR GATHERING, PEDESTRIAN BIKE FACILITIES, 
20:07:47 TRANSIT AMENITIES, AND OVERALL ESTHETIC IMPROVEMENTS.

20:07:54 SO AS I MENTIONED, WE DID DO A DEMONSTRATION PROJECT, AND THAT WAS TO TEST THE EFFECTS OF THE 3-LANE OPTION.

20:08:04 AND WHAT THIS ALLOWED US TO DO WAS ACTUALLY RECLAIM SOME OF THE STREET SPACE AND PUT IN STREET SIDE DINING, 
20:08:15 WHICH WE CALL IN FREMONT POP-UP PATIOS, AND ONE WAS INSTALLED IN FRONT OF   ARTISTS' WALK, AND ANOTHER IN FRONT OF 
20:08:17 THE D.F. GANNON RESTAURANT.

20:08:23 WE THEN PREPARED AN ONLINE SURVEY TO HEAR FEEDBACK FROM THE COMMUNITY, AND THEN WE PUBLISHED THE RESULTS ON OUR 
20:08:23 WEBSITE.

20:08:39 AT THE SAME TIME, WE ALSO ANALYZED IT IN TERMS OF TRAFFIC VOLUMES AND COUNTS IN TERMS OF BICYCLE COUNTS AND 
20:08:44 ACTIVITY AND WE DISCUSSED RESULTS AT OUR COMMUNITY MEETING NUMBER HAD 4 WHICH WAS HELD JUST LAST MONTH.

20:08:49 SO WHAT DO WE HEAR FROM THE SURVEY AND SEE IN THE ANALYSIS?

20:08:56 WE GOT I THINK AN EXTRAORDINARY LEVEL OF RESPONSE, OVER 400 PEOPLE PARTICIPATED IN A SURVEY.

20:09:06 THE OVERWHELMING CONCLUSION, THOUGH, WAS THAT 90% OF THE RESPONSE WAS OPPOSED TO THE LANE REDUCTION, AND 
20:09:10 FOLKS PREFERRED TO RESTORE FREMONT BOULEVARD BACK TO FOUR LANES.

20:09:17 IT'S SIGNIFICANT, A NUMBER OF PEOPLE REPORTED THAT INCREASED TRAFFIC CONGESTION.

20:09:23 THERE WAS ALSO A SIGNIFICANT ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE SLOWERRING, NARROWING OF THE STREET DID HAVE 
20:09:32 BENEFITS FOR PEDESTRIAN SAFETY, BUT INTERESTINGLY, THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY THAT WAS THE BIGGEST ADVOCATE FOR 
20:09:42 REDUCING LANES, MANY OF THEM REPORTED GREATER DIFFICULTY FOR CUSTOMER ACCESS TO THEIR BUSINESSES, AND THEN WE FOUND 
20:09:44 THERE WAS VERY LITTLE USE OF THE POP-UP PATIOS.

20:09:53 IN OUR TRAFFIC ANALYSIS,  ADMITTEDLY THIS WAS QUITE CHALLENGING BECAUSE WE WERE DOING THIS IN THE MIDDLE OF 
20:10:08 COVID, AND SO THERE WAS, DUE TO COVID, AN OVERALL 30% REDUCTION IN TRAFFIC VOLUMES, MAKING BEFORE AND AFTER 
20:10:09 COMPARISONS DIFFICULT.

20:10:16 BUT I THINK FOR STAFF, WHAT WE FOUND WAS REALLY PROBABLY A ROOT CAUSE OF A LOT OF THE CONCERNS AND ACTUALLY AN 
20:10:25 OBSERVED ISSUE IN THE CORRIDOR WAS ASSOCIATED WITH THE FREQUENT AMOUNT OF TRAIN TRAFFIC THAT CROSSES FREMONT 
20:10:26 BOULEVARD.

20:10:37 AND SO THERE ARE ON THE ORDER OF 15 TO 20 TRAINS THAT CROSS THE CORRIDOR, AND WHEN THAT OCCURS, TRAFFIC DOES BACK UP 
20:10:38 SIGNIFICANTLY ON FREMONT BOULEVARD.

20:10:41 IT DID THAT BEFORE.

20:10:51 WE DID THE LANE REDUCTION, BUT WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT THE TRAFFIC QUEUES EXTENDED A SIGNIFICANTLY LONGER 
20:10:57 DISTANCE, BACKED UP TRAFFIC, CREATED ACCESS RESTRICTIONS, AND  BECAUSE -- AND THEN AFTER THE TRAIN PASSED, WITH 
20:11:07 ONLY ONE LANE IN THE NORTHBOUND DIRECTION, THE RECOVERY PERIOD AFTER A TRAIN EVENT WAS SIGNIFICANTLY LONGER 
20:11:15 AND CREATED SITUATIONS WHERE THERE IS SORT OF FREQUENT CONGESTION WITHIN THE CORRIDOR.

20:11:28 IT'S TOUGH TO MEASURE THAT IN TERMS OF VOLUME LEVELS OF SERVICE, BUT THROUGH  OBSERVATIONS LOOKING HOW LONG OF A 
20:11:32 BACKUP, WE FELT THAT WAS A SIGNIFICANT ISSUE AND CONSTRAINT ON THE CORRIDOR.

20:11:41 SO WHAT WE ARE RECOMMENDING IS TO GO BACK TO FOUR LANES WITHIN THE CORRIDOR, PRIMARILY FOR OPERATIONAL 
20:11:42 PURPOSES.

20:11:53 HOWEVER, WE FEEL WE CAN INTRODUCE INTO THE PROJECT AREA SOME VERY GREAT COMPLETE STREET IMPROVEMENTS THAT MAKE 
20:11:57 THE CORRIDOR BETTER FOR PEDESTRIANS, FOR PEOPLE BIKING AND USING TRANSIT.

20:12:05 SO ONE OF THE ISSUES IN TERMS OF PEDESTRIAN ACCESSIBILITY IS TO HAVE MORE SAFE PLACES WHERE PEOPLE CAN 
20:12:15 CROSS THE STREET, AND SO WE HAVE A PLANNED NEW PEDESTRIAN CROSSINGS OR BEACONS AT BONDE AND AT THE ARTIST 
20:12:17 WALK DRIVEWAY.

20:12:28 WE WERE GOING TO BE NARROWING THE WIDE INTERSECTIONS ON FREMONT BOULEVARD AT THORNTON AND AT PERALTA.

20:12:33 FOR BIKE INFRASTRUCTURE, THE PLAN IS TO ACTUALLY BRING UP THE SIDE LANES TO THE SIDEWALK LEVEL AND BE SEPARATED 
20:12:42 FROM THE SIDEWALKS THAT CREATES A SAFER AND MORE ATTRACTIVE PLACE FOR BICYCLING THAT'S OUT OF THE STREET, 
20:12:48 AND THEN WE HAVE  AMENITIES PLANNED FOR IMPROVING A TRANSIT SERVICE.

20:12:57 ALL OF THIS WILL ALSO INCLUDE SOME MAJOR REHABILITATION OF THE CORRIDOR, INCLUDING THE PAVEMENT CONDITIONS AND 
20:12:57 SIDEWALK CONDITIONS.

20:13:05 AND WHEN WE INHERITED THIS FROM STATE OF CALIFORNIA, IT WASN'T IN VERY GOOD SHAPE AND WE FEEL WE CAN TAKE BETTER 
20:13:14 CARE OF IT AND SO THE WHOLE AREA WILL GET A REHABILITATED STREET FROM A PAVEMENT PERSPECTIVE.

20:13:22 I MIGHT NOTE SORT OF AT THE TOP OF THE SLIDE IS THAT WE ARE RECOMMENDING TO DO THESE IMPROVEMENTS NOW, UNDER THE 
20:13:31 GRANT, IN THE AREA OF FREMONT BOULEVARD FROM THORNTON TO PERALTA AND THE AREA SOUTH OF PERALTA, WE'RE PROPOSING TO 
20:13:38 DEFER UNTIL SUCH TIME IT CAN BE INTEGRATED WITH A NEW PLAN DEVELOPMENT.

20:13:39 I'LL TOUCH ON THAT HERE IN A MOMENT.

20:13:43 SO HERE'S AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT A SEPARATED RAISED BIKEWAY LOOKS LIKE.

20:13:50 SO IT'S SEPARATE, IT'S OUT OF THE STREET, BUT IT HAS A SEPARATION FROM THE SIDEWALK AREA.

20:13:59 HERE'S AN EXAMPLE OF AN IMPROVED TRANSIT STOP, WHERE OFTENTIMES THE BUS SHELTERS ARE LOCATED WITHIN THE 
20:14:06 SIDEWALK AREA AND IT CREATES A BLOCKAGE POINT, SO HERE THE TRANSIT SHELTER WOULD ACTUALLY GO INTO THE AREA WHERE 
20:14:07 THERE'S ON-STREET PARKING.

20:14:17 THE BUSES WOULD ACTUALLY STOP IN THE LANE, CONVENIENTLY PICK UP OR DROP OFF PASSENGERS AND CONTINUE, AND SO THIS 
20:14:25 CREATES A BETTER OPERATIONAL SITUATION FOR TRANSIT AND THEN AVOIDS HAVING TRANSIT USERS BLOCKING THE SPACE WHERE 
20:14:27 PEOPLE ARE WALKING AND BIKING.

20:14:37 SO THE AREA SOUTH OF PERALTA HAS A SPECIAL CHALLENGE, AND WE WERE ANTICIPATING INTEGRATING THE COMPLETE 
20:14:42 STREET PROJECT WITH A NEW PLAN DEVELOPMENT IN THE AREA SOUTH OF PERALTA.

20:14:53 A NEW DEVELOPMENT AND OWNERSHIP TEAM IS TAKING OVER THAT  PROJECT, AND WE THINK IT'S BEST TO INTEGRATE 
20:14:56 IMPROVEMENTS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF FREMONT BOULEVARD TOGETHER WITH THAT.

20:15:05 NOW THAT PROJECT WILL COME IN, THE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT IS A CONDITION TO WIDEN SIDEWALKS, RE-DO THE STREETSCAPE 
20:15:13 INCLUDING TREES, AND SO WE'LL REALLY CLEAN UP THAT SIDE OF THE STREET, AND WE THINK THAT THAT'S A GOOD TIME TO 
20:15:20 ALSO THEN ADDRESS THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STREET SO THAT THERE'S COMPATIBILITY, CONSISTENCY, AND SORT OF THIS PART OF 
20:15:31 THE STREET ALSO ALLOWS FOR BUILDING ANOTHER NEW PEDESTRIAN CROSSING BEACON IN THIS SECTION, AND THEN FOR THE 
20:15:41 BUSINESSES IN THE AREA, THEN THERE WON'T BE TWO PHASES OF CONSTRUCTION THAT WOULD OCCUR, DISRUPTING BUSINESS 
20:15:43 ACTIVITY TWICE, SO BETTER TO DO IT ALL AT ONCE.

20:15:47 SO WE HAVE CREATED A CONCEPT PLAN OF WHAT THAT COULD LOOK LIKE.

20:15:53 AND SO WE'RE PREPARED TO WORK WITH A FUTURE DEVELOPER TO ADDRESS THAT PART OF THE STREET.

20:15:59 I MIGHT ADD, THERE'S A LOT OF OTHER GREAT THINGS THAT ARE PLANNED FOR THE CENTERVILLE  AREA.

20:16:08 THE COMPLETE STREET PROJECT FUNDED BY THE GRANT ALSO  INCLUDES THORNTON AVENUE FROM FREMONT BOULEVARD BACK TO 
20:16:15  880, SO WE'RE IMPLEMENTING IMPROVEMENTS AS PART OF THE SAFE ROUTES TO SCHOOL PLAN, AND THERE WILL 
20:16:17 BE A NEW TRAFFIC SIGNAL INSTALLED IN THAT AREA.

20:16:26 WE HAVE A SIGNAL MO TERNIZATION PROJECT THAT'S IN CONSTRUCTION NOW, UNDERGROUND UTILITY WORK ON BOTH 
20:16:33 PERALTA AND FREMONT BOULEVARD, AND WE ARE ADVANCING PLANNING TO CREATE A QUIET ZONE IN THE ENTIRE CENTERVILLE 
20:16:39 CORRIDOR, WHICH WILL IMPROVE THE ENVIRONMENT IN TERMS OF ELIMINATING HORN BLASTS.

20:16:47 SO JUST TO CLOSE, WHAT WE'RE RECOMMENDING IS THE COUNCIL ACTION IS TO IMPROVE A STREET DESIGN DIRECTION 
20:16:57 FOR FREMONT BOULEVARD THAT RETAINS FOUR LANES, TWO IN EACH DIRECTION, AND THEN WE WILL FOLLOW UP AND PREPARE FINAL 
20:17:01 DESIGN PLANS CONSISTENT WITH GRANT REQUIREMENTS AND DEADLINES.

20:17:08 WE'LL PROVIDE THE COMMUNITY WITH REPORTS ON PROGRESS IN TERMS OF THE DESIGN DETAILS ON OUR PROJECT WEBPAGE, 
20:17:17 AND THEN WE'LL LOOK FORWARD TO DOING A PHASE 2 PROJECT TOGETHER WITH PRIVATE DEVELOPMENT IN THE AREA SOUTH OF 
20:17:17 PERALTA.

20:17:19 THAT CONCLUDES OUR PRESENTATION.

20:17:23 I HAVE OTHER MEMBERS OF OUR STAFF AVAILABLE TO ADDRESS ANY QUESTIONS.

20:17:24 THANK YOU.

20:17:52 >> Councilmember Jones: MADAME MAYOR, YOU ARE MUTED.

20:17:55 >> Ms. Gauthier: HANS, CAN YOU STOP SHARING YOUR SCREEN,  PLEASE?

20:17:58 >> Mayor Mei: IF YOU COULD ASK FOR CLARIFYING QUESTIONS, I SEE COUNCILMEMBER JONES.

20:18:05 >> Councilmember Jones: THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR, AND THANK  YOU, HANS, FOR THE PRESENTATION.

20:18:08 I JUST HAD A QUICK QUESTION REGARDING THE OVERALL DIAGRAM.

20:18:15 YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT LANES IN TWO DIRECTION BUT THE DIAGRAM SHOWED NOT FOUR LANES BUT FIVE.

20:18:20 ARE YOU REINSTATING THE LANE DOWN THE CENTER OF THE STREET?

20:18:23 >> Mr. Larsen: SO I THINK WERE YOU REFERRING TO THE CROSS-SECTION ON THE RECOMMENDED SCOPE.

20:18:33 SO THAT DID INCLUDE -- SO THIS IS THE AREA NORTH OF BONDE, SO THERE'S ACTUALLY ON-STREET PARKING LANE THAT'S 
20:18:34 RETAINED IN THERE.

20:18:38 AND SO THERE'S ONLY TWO LANES IN EACH DIRECTION.

20:18:42 SO THERE IS NOT A TWO-WAY LEFT TURN LANE IN THAT AREA.

20:18:45 >> Councilmember Jones: OKAY.

20:18:47 WHICH SIDE IS THE ON-STREET PARKING LANE?

20:18:50 I JUST KEPT SEEING VEHICLE LANE BUT IT DIDN'T REALLY SPECIFY.

20:18:58 >> Mr. Larsen: SO I MAY -- JUST TO MAKE SURE WE GET IT RIGHT, SO THERE IS VARIATIONS IN THE CROSS-SECTION ON 
20:19:09 FREMONT BOULEVARD, AND LET ME LET NOE EXPLAIN A LITTLE MORE DETAIL IN TERMS OF WHERE THEY'LL BE  PARKING IN THAT 
20:19:09 CORRIDOR.

20:19:09 NOE?

20:19:14 >> GOOD EVENING, COUNCILMEMBERS.

20:19:23 COUNCILMEMBER JONES, YES, WE DO PLAN TO PROVIDE PARKING ON THE EAST SIDE OF THE ROADWAY NORTH OF PERALTA, IN FRONT 
20:19:26 OF THE ARTISTS' WALK DEVELOPMENT.

20:19:34 AND THEN ONE OF THE EXHIBITS THAT WAS SHARED TONIGHT DID FEATURE A FIFTH LANE, BUT THAT WOULD BE RETURNING A 
20:19:38 LEFT TURN POCKET IN THE AREA APPROACHING THE PERALTA INTERSECTION.

20:19:40 SO IT WAS PREVIOUSLY THERE.

20:19:45 WE'RE JUST PUTTING IN A LEFT TURN POCKET WHICH WOULD EFFECTIVELY ADD A FIFTH LANE AT THE INTERSECTION.

20:19:48 >> Councilmember Cox: CAN YOU SHOW A PICTURE OF THAT?

20:19:50 IS THERE A PICTURE TO SHOW US?

20:20:17 >> Mr. Larsen: SO THIS IS THE ONE THAT HAS THE FOUR LANES PLUS PARKING ON ONE SIDE.

20:20:28 SO THIS WOULD BE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE AREA NEAR ARTISTS' WALK WITH PARKING IN FRONT OF  ARTISTS' WALK.

20:20:31 AND I'M NOT RECALLING ANOTHER ONE THAT WE --

20:20:32 >> Councilmember Jones: THAT WAS THE ONE I WAS REFERRING TO.

20:20:36 I GUESS I JUST DIDN'T GET CLOSE ENOUGH TO READ THE TINY WRITING.

20:20:48 SO THIS WOULD BE FOUR LANES OF TRAVEL PLUS TWO RAISED BIKE LANES PLUS WIDER SIDEWALKS THAN ARE THERE CURRENTLY?

20:20:55 >> Mr. Larsen: I THINK IN THE CROSS-SECTION, AGAIN, THE WIDTH -- THE CROSS-SECTION  VARIES IN EACH AREA, SO 
20:20:59 THIS DOES ILLUSTRATE THE RAISED SIDEWALK CONCEPT.

20:21:09 THIS IS REPRESENTATIVE OF ONE OF THE NARROWER AREAS OF THE CORRIDOR, WHERE ARTISTS' WALK IS AND WHERE WE'VE HAD 
20:21:17 AN OPPORTUNITY FOR NEW DEVELOPMENT, THEY HAVE WIDENED THE SIDEWALK TO CREATE MORE SPACE WHEN THERE HAVE BEEN 
20:21:17 NEW PROJECTS.

20:21:28 SO SORT OF THE CURB TO BACK A BUILDING SPACE ON ARTIST WALK IS AT A 14-FOOT LEVEL.

20:21:28 >> Councilmember Jones: OKAY.

20:21:29 GREAT.

20:21:29 THANK YOU.

20:21:31 THOSE ARE ALL MY QUESTIONS FOR NOW.

20:21:31 >> Mayor Mei: OKAY.

20:21:33 AT THIS POINT, CLARIFYING QUESTIONS ONLY.

20:21:35 COUNCILMEMBER SHAO.

20:21:38 >> Councilmember Shao: THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR.

20:21:42 ACTUALLY MY FIRST QUESTION WAS ASKED BY COUNCILMEMBER JONES AND THANK YOU FOR THE RESPONSE.

20:21:57 A FOLLOW-UP QUESTION WOULD BE THAT BY DOING THAT, HOW MANY PARKING SPACES OR STORE SPACES WOULD BE GENERATED?

20:22:02 IF YOU DON'T HAVE IT RIGHT HERE, YOU KNOW, THAT'S OKAY, YOU CAN SEND ME AN EMAIL AFTERWARDS.

20:22:11 MY SECOND QUESTION WOULD BE THAT YOU MENTIONED ABOUT THIS SIGNAL MODERNIZATION PROJECT COVERING THE 
20:22:16 NINE MILES AND THIS IS  COVERED BY THE COMPLETE STREET FUND.

20:22:24 I WONDER WHETHER THE COMPLETE STREET FUND COULD ALSO COVER THE SIGNAL MODERNIZATION IN THE REST OF FREMONT 
20:22:27 OR THEY HAVE COME FROM SEPARATE FUNDING SOURCE?

20:22:38 >> Mr. Larsen: THE SIGNAL MODERNIZATION PROJECT IS NOT PART OF THE COMPLETE STREETS PROJECT, SO THAT SLIDE I WAS 
20:22:45 SHOWING WAS ESSENTIALLY OTHER PROJECTS THAT ARE PLANNED AND THAT HAVE BENEFIT IN THE CENTERVILLE AREA.

20:22:49 SO THAT'S A SEPARATE GRANT.

20:22:59 BUT AS COUNCIL MAY KNOW, SIGNAL MODERNIZATION IS A PRIORITY FOR US, AND WE'RE WORKING TO ADVANCE PROJECTS 
20:23:03 AND GET FUNDING TO ULTIMATELY BRING SIGNAL MODERNIZATION EVERYWHERE IN FREMONT.

20:23:07 >> Councilmember Shao: THANK  YOU.

20:23:10 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

20:23:12 CLARIFYING QUESTIONS, COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN.

20:23:22 >> Councilmember Kassan: I WANTED TO GET MORE CLARIFICATION ON THIS SURVEY THAT WAS DONE.

20:23:30 FROM WHAT I'M HEARING, THAT WAS THE MAJOR REASON FOR THE DECISION TO GO BACK TO FOUR LANES, WAS THE OUTCOME OF 
20:23:30 THIS SURVEY.

20:23:40 BUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THIS SURVEY WAS ABSOLUTELY NOT DONE IN ANY KIND OF SCIENTIFIC WAY, IT WAS NOT A 
20:23:45 REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLE OF PEOPLE WHO WOULD USE THE STREETS.

20:23:52 WE HAVE NO WAY OF KNOWING IF YOUNG CHILDREN PARTICIPATED IN THE SURVEY, IF PEOPLE WITHOUT HOMES PARTICIPATED 
20:24:04 IN THE  SURVEY, IF BUSINESS OWNERS, WE HAVE NO WAY OF KNOWING IF IT WAS REPRESENTATIVE.

20:24:13 SO I'M JUST CONCERNED WE'RE MAKING SUCH A MAJOR DECISION BASED ON SUCH AN UNSCIENTIFIC WAY OF GATHERING PEOPLE'S 
20:24:13 INPUT.

20:24:17 >> Mr. Larsen: LET ME TRY TO ADDRESS THAT.

20:24:26 SO I THINK WITH KIND OF THE TWO YEARS OF OUTREACH WE DID, WE USED A LOT OF DIFFERENT WAYS TO GET INPUT FROM THE 
20:24:35 COMMUNITY, AND SO FOCUS GROUPS WITH THE BUSINESS COMMUNITIES, WE HAD WORKSHOPS, WITH GROUPS THAT REALLY 
20:24:43 REPRESENTED ALL DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES, ADVOCATES FOR WALKING AND BIKING AND TRANSIT, BUSINESS, PEOPLE THAT LIVED 
20:24:56 IN THE COMMUNITY AND WE LOOKED AT IT FROM OUR PROFESSIONAL JUDGMENT OF HOW IS IT WORKING AND OPERATING.

20:24:57 SO A VARIETY OF SOURCES.

20:25:07 THE LAST SURVEY THAT WAS DONE THAT WAS LOOKING TO GAUGE THE KIND OF OPINIONS OF FOLKS AFTER WE DID THE 
20:25:13 DEMONSTRATION  PROJECT.

20:25:18 IT WAS GENERALLY OPEN TO WHOEVER WANTED TO PARTICIPATE IN IT, BUT WE DO HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING -- WE DID ASK 
20:25:25 QUESTIONS OF DO YOU LIVE IN THE CENTERVILLE AREA, HOW DO YOU USE THE STREET, PEOPLE THAT ARE WALKING AND 
20:25:42 BIKING AND TRAVELING, SO WE THINK IT GOT A -- ON VARIOUS INPUTS, BUT I THINK THE CONCLUSION WAS VERY STRONG 
20:25:44 WITH CONCERNS ABOUT THE WAY IT OPERATED.

20:25:51 AND I THINK GETTING THOSE RESULTS, AND THEN I THINK THE OTHER THING IS THAT THERE WAS DEFINITELY A MAJOR 
20:26:00 STAKEHOLDER WAS SUPPORTING THE BUSINESS DISTRICT, AND THAT IS A PRIORITY OF THE CITY COUNCIL TO HELP OUR BUSINESS 
20:26:08 DISTRICTS AND BRING MORE VITALITY TO THEM, SO THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY WAS A STAKEHOLDER THAT WORKED, I THINK 
20:26:23 PARTICULARLY CLOSELY WITH, AND SO I THINK WE SAW TOO THAT THE ENTHUSIASM FOR REDUCING THE ROAD DIET AND LANE 
20:26:30 REDUCTION IN THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY RESULTED IN A LOT OF BUSINESSES FEELING THAT THIS JUST WAS NOT IN THE 
20:26:31 LONG TERM BEST INTEREST OF THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY.

20:26:33 SO WE SAW A LESSENING OF THAT.

20:26:40 AND I KNOW -- I BELIEVE THERE'S SOME FOLKS FROM THE COMMUNITY WHO REPRESENT THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY AND IT WOULD BE 
20:26:43 GOOD TO HEAR THEIR INPUT DIRECTLY ON THE TOPIC.

20:26:55 WE LOOKED ALMOST FROM AN OBSERVATIONAL PERSPECTIVE AND SAW REALLY THE VERY SIGNIFICANT IMPACT THAT A TRAIN 
20:27:07 CROSSING DISRUPTION CREATES IN THE CORRIDOR, AND THE LONG TERM RECOVERY PARTICULARLY WHEN YOU ONLY HAVE ONE 
20:27:13 LANE TO PROCESS TRAFFIC, THAT CREATES A VERY LONG QUEUE AND A LOT OF BLOCKAGE AND DISRUPTION IN THE CORRIDOR, AND I 
20:27:25 THINK UNFORTUNATELY, THAT'S JUST A CONDITION THAT'S SORT OF HARD TO WORK WITH, AND DO A LANE REDUCTION IN THE 
20:27:31 AREA AND HAVE FREMONT BOULEVARD FUNCTION IN A REASONABLE WAY.

20:27:38 AND THEN WE'RE ALSO DEALING WITH REDUCED TRAFFIC VOLUMES DURING COVID THAT ARE DOWN 30% OF WHAT THEY WOULD 
20:27:47 MAYBE NORMALLY BE, SO THAT JUST WOULD BE AGGRAVATED FURTHER.

20:28:01 I THINK STAFF'S PROFESSIONAL VIEW, BOTH BALANCING INPUT AND HOW IT OPERATES, AND WE DO FEEL WE CAN MAKE A LOT OF 
20:28:04 IMPROVEMENTS IN THE AREA OF COMPLETE STREETS AND STILL HAVE A VERY GOOD CORRIDOR THERE.

20:28:13 SO I THINK THIS WAS SORT OF A POPULIST VIEW, LOOK AT THE SURVEY, THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO, BUT FOR US, OUR 
20:28:20 RECOMMENDATION TO YOU BASED ON A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT INPUTS.

20:28:23 >> Councilmember Kassan: I'M REALLY CONFUSED ABOUT SOME THINGS THAT YOU'RE SAYING.

20:28:35 SO FIRST OF ALL, IN TERMS OF DELAYS CAUSED BY TRAINS, YOU SAID THAT CONDITION EXISTED FROM THE VERY 
20:28:36 BEGINNING, THAT THAT HASN'T CHANGED.

20:28:43 SO I'M CURIOUS WHY WE WOULD HAVE EVEN GONE TO THE TROUBLE OF  DOING ALL THIS COMMUNITY  OUTREACH ABOUT NARROWING -- 
20:28:50 ABOUT REDUCING LANES IF FROM THE VERY BEGINNING YOU KNEW THAT THE TRAINS WOULD MAYBE MAKE IT SOMETHING THAT YOU 
20:28:51 WOULDN'T END UP RECOMMENDING.

20:28:59 IT SEEMS LIKE WE JUST SPENT A HECK OF A LOT OF MONEY AND TIME LOOKING AT A POTENTIAL CHANGE TO THE STREET THAT 
20:29:02 YOU'RE SAYING WAS NEVER VIABLE BECAUSE OF THE TRAINS.

20:29:17 >> Mr. Larsen: THESE TYPES OF STREET CHANGES, IT'S OFTENTIMES YOU WANT TO TEST IT OUT AND SEE HOW IT WORKS.

20:29:31 IN OTHER EXAMPLES, YOU KNOW, IN OTHER COMMUNITIES, YOU DO THE ROAD RESTRICTION, YOU GO OTHER PLACES, FIND 
20:29:33 OTHER CORRIDOR, IT REALLY DOESN'T HAVE MUCH OF AN IMPACT.

20:29:41 WE DIDN'T REALLY FIND THAT THERE'S DIVERSION, OTHER CORRIDORS, PLACES FOR PEOPLE TO GO.

20:29:46 GENERALLY PEOPLE THAT ARE ON FREMONT BOULEVARD HAVE SORT OF BUSINESS OR PLACES TO GO WITHIN THE CORRIDOR, 
20:29:54 CHURCH, SCHOOL, THEIR BUSINESSES THAT THEY'RE GOING TO.

20:30:00 SO IT'S SORT OF HARD TO MODEL OR PREDICT EXACTLY WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN, SO PUTTING DOWN SOME PAINT AND 
20:30:14 TESTING IT OUT, PARTICULARLY WHEN YOU HAVE VERY STRONG OPINIONS FROM THE COMMUNITY ON BOTH SIDES OF THE ISSUE 
20:30:14 IS A GOOD WAY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WOULD HAPPEN.

20:30:20 SO I THINK WE REALIZED THERE WOULD PROBABLY BE SOME CHALLENGES WITH THIS, BUT WITH A STRONG INTEREST TO GIVE IT 
20:30:30 A  TRY, CERTAINLY AN ORIENTATION THAT WE HAVE IN TERMS OF PLANS AND POLICIES TO REALLY PURSUE COMPLETE STREETS AND 
20:30:33 MULTIMODAL TRANSPORTATION IN A BOLD WAY.

20:30:41 WE THOUGHT IT WAS WORTH GIVING A TRY AND SEE HOW IT WOULD WORK AND THEN BASE THE DECISION ON WHAT THE RESULTS ARE.

20:30:44 >> Councilmember Kassan: OKAY.

20:30:51 ANOTHER THING I'M CONFUSED ABOUT IS, IT SOUNDS LIKE THE FEEDBACK YOU GOT FROM BUSINESSES WAS A LITTLE BIT MIXED, YOU 
20:30:59 KNOW, YOU HEARD AT ONE POINT THAT THE BUSINESSES LIKED THE IDEA OF REDUCING THE LANES, BUT THEN LATER YOU HEARD 
20:31:01 THAT MANY DIDN'T LIKE IT.

20:31:12 I WISH WE HAD -- INSTEAD OF THIS KIND OF ANECDOTAL DISCUSSION, I WISH THERE WAS A LITTLE BIT MORE CONCRETE DATA ON 
20:31:20 WHAT THE BUSINESSES THINK ABOUT IT, AND I'M ALSO INCREDIBLY CONCERNED ABOUT BUSINESS OWNERS NOT HAVING PARKING IN 
20:31:22 FRONT OF THEIR  STOREFRONT.

20:31:28 AND I'M WONDERING HOW MUCH FEEDBACK WAS OBTAINED FROM THE BUSINESS OWNERS ON THE EFFECT THAT THEY FELT THAT THAT 
20:31:31 WOULD HAVE ON THEM TO HAVE NO PARKING IN FRONT OF THEIR STOREFRONT.

20:31:44 >> Mr. Larsen: I DON'T KNOW, I MEAN, IN THE SURVEY, WE DID ASK WHETHER YOU'RE A RESIDENT OR BUSINESS IN THE AREA, SO 
20:31:53 WE WERE ABLE TO IDENTIFY FEEDBACK FROM BUSINESSES IN THERE AND WE INCLUDED IN THE STAFF REPORT AND THE PRESENTATION 
20:32:03 THAT 26 BUSINESSES THAT RESPONDED TO THE SURVEY GENERALLY HAD KIND OF A NEGATIVE VIEW OF THE DEMONSTRATION PROJECT.

20:32:12 AND FELT THAT IT CREATED MORE CHALLENGES FOR SERVING THEIR CUSTOMERS THAN NOT.

20:32:15 >> Councilmember Kassan: OKAY.

20:32:20 SO WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THEIR THOUGHTS ARE ON NOT HAVING ANY PARKING.

20:32:31 AND THEN IN TERMS OF THE SURVEY, I'M STILL CONFUSED ABOUT HOW WE CAN USE IT AS SUCH -- AS AN INDICATOR OF WHAT 
20:32:38 PEOPLE WANT WHEN I THINK THERE'S A PRETTY HIGH LIKELIHOOD THAT IT'S NOT A REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLE OF THE USERS OF 
20:32:39 THE STREET.

20:32:45 I MEAN, THE PEOPLE WHO TEND TO ANSWER THESE KINDS OF SURVEYS ARE GENERALLY NOT GOING TO BE THE LOWER INCOME 
20:32:50 PEOPLE, THE PEOPLE WHO MAYBE HAVE THREE  JOBS, THE CHILDREN THAT ARE WALKING TO SCHOOL.

20:32:56 SO IS THERE ANY DATA AT ALL -- AND BY THE WAY, YOU KNOW, LOW INCOME PEOPLE AND PEOPLE OF COLOR ARE FAR MORE 
20:33:05 LIKELY TO BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY TRAFFIC COLLISIONS, SO I'M JUST WONDERING, IS THERE ANY DATA AT ALL ON 
20:33:14 HOW REPRESENTATIVE THE SAMPLE WAS IN TERMS OF INCOME LEVELS, RACE, AGE, GENDER, COUNTRY OF ORIGIN, LANGUAGE 
20:33:15 SPOKEN AT HOME, ANYTHING LIKE THAT?

20:33:22 >> Mr. Larsen: THE SURVEY WE DID DIDN'T ASK THOSE KINDS OF QUESTIONS.

20:33:25 >> Councilmember Kassan: ALL RIGHT.

20:33:26 THOSE ARE ALL MY QUESTIONS.

20:33:27 THANK YOU.

20:33:34 >> Mayor Mei: I JUST WANTED TO CHECK THE TIME BECAUSE RIGHT NOW WE'RE RUNNING OVER AND I'M LOOKING FOR MS. 
20:33:34 GAUTHIER.

20:33:39 ARE WE DUE FOR A BREAK FIRST BEFORE WE RETURN?

20:33:43 I'M SORRY, MISS GAUTHIER, YOU'RE ON MUTE.

20:33:44 >> Ms. Gauthier: SORRY ABOUT THAT.

20:33:51 YEAH, WE'RE ABOUT DUE, IF -- I'M NOT SURE HOW MANY MORE COUNCILMEMBERS HAVE QUESTIONS, IF YOU WANT TO GET THROUGH 
20:33:55 THOSE AND THEN TAKE OUR BREAK BEFORE ORAL -- PUBLIC COMMENT.

20:33:57 >> Mayor Mei: I WAS JUST CHECKING THE TIME.

20:33:58 >> Ms. Gauthier: YEP.

20:34:01 >> Mayor Mei: SO CLARIFYING QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME, COUNCILMEMBER KENG.

20:34:04 >> Councilmember Keng: THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR.

20:34:17 I DID ALSO HAVE QUESTIONS REGARDING THE COMMUNITY OUTREACH PROCESS, AND IF WE ARE STILL LOOKING TO DO MORE OUTREACH 
20:34:22 OR IF THAT WAS ALL THE OUTREACH THAT WE WERE PLANNING TO DO.

20:34:28 >> Mr. Larsen: I THINK SORT OF THE TWO-YEAR PROCESS WITH A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT OUTREACH AND INPUTS IS WHAT 
20:34:43 WE'RE  PLANNING TO DO AND I THINK  WE'RE -- A LOT OF THINGS IN ADVANCING THIS PROJECT AS WE'VE WANTED TO.

20:34:53 WE DID THE DEMONSTRATION PROJECT ACTUALLY ABOUT A YEAR AGO, AND THERE WAS -- THEN WE WERE FACED WITH THE 
20:35:01 SCHOOLS WEREN'T OPEN, AND SO THERE WERE A LOT OF CONCERNS ABOUT NOT GETTING A GOOD ANALYSIS BECAUSE WE DIDN'T HAVE 
20:35:08 SCHOOL TRAFFIC IN THE MIX, SO WE DECIDED TO POSTPONE THE STUDIES AND THE SURVEYS UNTIL THE FALL, UNTIL WE 
20:35:13 HAD THAT LAYERED INTO IT.

20:35:15 NOW OMICRON HIT.

20:35:20 WE'RE SORT OF HOPING WE COULD GET PAST COVID AND GET TO A POINT OF MORE NORMALIZATION.

20:35:28 THE CHALLENGE WE FACE, REALLY, AND THIS IS JUST SORT OF THE HAND WE'VE BEEN DEALT, IS THE GRANT THAT WE HAVE TO DO 
20:35:34 ANY COMPLETE STREET WORK IN THE  AREA.

20:35:37 THERE IS A DEADLINE ON IT, IT IS A STRICT DEADLINE.

20:35:44 THIS IS OLD FEDERAL MONEY THAT WE'RE USING, AND WE EITHER NEED TO KIND OF DECIDE THAT WE'VE GOT A PROJECT WE 
20:35:52 WANT TO GO FORWARD AND DELIVER, AND WE REALLY NEED TO MAKE A DECISION NOW IN TERMS OF DIRECTION WE'RE GOING.

20:36:00 THE CONSEQUENCE OF NOT  DELIVERING FEDERAL GRANT ON TIME WOULD HAVE IMPLICATIONS ON THE CITY OF FREMONT 
20:36:02 FOR FUTURE FEDERAL MONEYS.

20:36:11 SO WE'RE GOING TO REALLY, AT THIS WILL FORTUNATE CRITICAL POINT WHERE WE NEED TO PICK A DIRECTION THAT WE'RE GOING 
20:36:15 TO GO REGARDING THE USE OF THIS COMPLETE STREETS GRANT.

20:36:32 WHERE I WAS GOING WITH THAT IS, WE REALLY DON'T HAVE SORT OF THE ABILITY TO DO A LOT MORE SORT OF STUDY AND 
20:36:34 SURVEY ON THIS TO FIGURE OUT WHAT DIRECTION WE WANT TO GO.

20:36:45  WE WANT TO HAVE THE PROJECT READY FOR CONSTRUCTION IN ABOUT 11 MONTHS.

20:36:51 SO THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE TO DESIGN ALL THE SORT OF COMPLETE STREET ELEMENTS THAT WE'RE RECOMMENDING AS 
20:36:52 PART OF THE PROJECT.

20:36:54 >> Councilmember Keng: I SEE.

20:36:54 ALL RIGHT.

20:36:54 THANK YOU.

20:36:58 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

20:37:03 CLARIFYING QUESTIONS, DID I ALREADY ASK COUNCILMEMBER JONES OR IS YOUR HAND STILL UP FROM BEFORE?

20:37:04 >> Councilmember Cox: I HAD MY HAND UP.

20:37:06 I HAVEN'T BEEN ACKNOWLEDGED.

20:37:09 >> Mayor Mei: I'M JUST CHEBBING BECAUSE WE'RE GOING IN ORDER OF WHAT I'M SEEING.

20:37:10 >> Councilmember Jones: THAT'S UP FROM PREVIOUSLY.

20:37:11 THANK YOU, MAYOR.

20:37:12 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

20:37:17 I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE, BECAUSE I SEE THEM IN ORDER OF PEOPLE THAT CLICK THE HANDS RAISED.

20:37:18 NEXT IS COUNCILMEMBER COX.

20:37:21 >> Councilmember Cox: YES.

20:37:27 I WOULD LIKE TO FIND OUT -- THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR PROVIDING THIS PRESENTATION.

20:37:39 I WOULD LIKE TO FIND OUT ABOUT THE TIMELINE, THERE ARE SOME STRICT GUIDELINES I SEE YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE 
20:37:44 READY TO GO AND RELEASED, IS THAT MY  UNDERSTANDING, BY JANUARY 21ST, 2023?

20:37:49 I NEED TO UNDERSTAND YOUR WHOLE TIMELINE THERE, BECAUSE SOME OF THESE GRANTS HAVE SPECIAL CONDITIONS AND 
20:37:57 TERMS, AND I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE SURE BEFORE I PLACE MY VOTE, AS WELL AS MY OTHER FELLOW CITY  COUNCILMEMBERS, 
20:38:04 THAT WE UNDERSTAND WHAT ARE SOME OF THE RISK AND SOME OF THE GAPS OR THINGS THAT WE NEED TO BE AWARE OF, BECAUSE 
20:38:07 THERE ARE SPECIAL TERMS WITH THAT $7.7 MILLION.

20:38:18 >> Mr. Larsen: SO THE KEY ONE IS TIMELY DELIVERY OF THE GRANT AND SO THE DEADLINE THAT WE'RE FACING IS 
20:38:26 ESSENTIALLY HAVING THE PROJECT READY TO GO TO BID FOR CONSTRUCTION AT THAT POINT, WE GET A CERTIFICATION FROM 
20:38:35 CALTRANS THAT THE PROJECT IS READY FOR CONSTRUCTION, AND THAT'S THE DEADLINE THAT WE'RE FACING, AND THEN WE HAVE 
20:38:38 ADDITIONAL TIME TO ACTUALLY BUILD THE PROJECT.

20:38:48 SO IT'S THE DESIGN PHASE THAT WE NEED TO COMPLETE BY JANUARY OF 2023.

20:38:53 >> Councilmember Cox: THE DESIGN PHASE.

20:38:54 OKAY.

20:39:07 IN TERMS OF LOOKING OUT ON ONE OF THE CHARTS, THERE WAS ONE THAT SHOWED THE FOUR LANES, AND IT WAS A HORIZONTAL 
20:39:07 PICTURE.

20:39:09 I'M TRYING TO FIND OUT ON WHAT PAGE THAT IS.

20:39:17 WAS THERE AN ISLAND IN THE MIDDLE AS YOU HAD THE FOUR  LANES, AND I THINK IT WAS WHERE YOU HAD THE FUTURE 
20:39:27 DEVELOPMENT SOMETHING, HERE IT IS ON  PAGE 14, SOUTH PERALTA.

20:39:32 AND THAT -- IS THAT JUST LISTING THE STREET NAME?

20:39:48 >> Mr. Larsen: JUST A SMALL PAINTED ISLAND THERE, SO  THAT'S -- I THINK MAYBE THE OTHER QUESTION, THAT 
20:39:58 BASICALLY CREATES A KIND OF A REDIRECTION OF TRAFFIC SO THAT SUPPORTS A LEFT TURN POCKET AS YOU 
20:39:59 APPROACH PERALTA.

20:40:04 >> City Mgr. Shackelford: HANS, WHY DON'T YOU PULL IT UP SO EVERYONE CAN SEE IT.

20:40:07 >> Mr. Larsen: LET ME SHARE MY SCREEN AGAIN.

20:40:09 >> City Mgr. Shackelford: THANKS .

20:40:26 >> Mr. Larsen: I BELIEVE THIS IS THE SLIDE YOU'RE REFERRING TO, COUNCILMEMBER COX.

20:40:28 I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN SEE MY POINTER HERE.

20:40:38 SO THIS IS KIND OF A CENTER STRIPE AND THE INTENT IS TO MOVE TRAFFIC TO THE SIDE SO THAT IT CLEARS A SPACE FOR A 
20:40:42 LEFT TURN POCKET, WHICH WOULD BE AT THE INTERSECTION OF PERALTA.

20:40:48 >> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.

20:40:54 WOULD THIS LAYOUT -- I ONLY SEE ONE CROSSWALK.

20:40:55 HOW IS IT SPACED?

20:41:01  BETWEEN THE SPACE OF THIS -- I MEAN, I FORGOT HOW MANY MILES THIS IS.

20:41:13 >> Mr. Larsen: SO THIS IS ACTUALLY A BRAND NEW CROSSING POINT THAT'S ADDED JUST SOUTH OF PERALTA TO CREATE -- AND 
20:41:22 SO WITHIN KIND OF THE WHOLE PLAN PROJECT, IF YOU LOOK FROM THORNTON TO PERALTA TO PARISH, WE'RE INTRODUCING 
20:41:27 IN THE CORRIDOR THREE NEW PEDESTRIAN CROSSING LOCATIONS.

20:41:34 SO THIS IS ONE OF THE -- I THINK THE GREAT THINGS THAT WE CAN DO IN THE AREA TO FACILITATE SAFE PEDESTRIAN 
20:41:34 MOVEMENT.

20:41:44 SO TWO OF THEM WILL BE FLASHING BEACON CROSSWALKS, AND THAT'S WHAT THIS WOULD BE, SO THIS IS AT THE DRIVEWAY 
20:41:52 APPROACH TO THE PROPOSED NEW DEVELOPMENT SOUTH OF PERALTA, SOMETHING SIMILAR WOULD BE PLACED AT 
20:42:01 THE MAIN DRIVEWAYALITY ARTIST WALK, AND THEN AT BONDE, NEAR THE ACE TRAIN STATION, AND THE AC TRANSIT BUS STOP, 
20:42:09 THERE ACTUALLY WOULD BE A PEDESTRIAN TRAFFIC SIGNAL THAT WOULD ACTUALLY FULLY STOP TRAFFIC AT THAT LOCATION.

20:42:17 SO WE'RE INTRODUCING FOO THE CORRIDOR BETWEEN THE EXISTING SIGNALS THREE NEW SAFE PEDESTRIAN CROSSINGS.

20:42:26 KOCH COX AND ARE THESE SAFE PEDESTRIAN WITH THE BEACONS, ARE THEY LIKE THE ONES THAT ARE MOTIONLESS SO YOU DON'T 
20:42:27 HAVE TO TOUCH THEM?

20:42:34 >> Mr. Larsen: YES, SO THESE ARE PEDESTRIAN-ACTIVATED BEACONS.

20:42:44 WE ARE, AS YOU MAY HAVE SEEN, USING, WE'RE TRYING OUT SOME NEW TECHNOLOGY WHERE YOU DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE TO 
20:42:46 PHYSICALLY PRESS THE BUTTON BUT YOU CAN WAVE YOUR HAND.

20:42:56 AND SO WE ARE DOING SOME TRIALS ON THAT TECHNOLOGY TO SEE IF THAT'S SOMETHING WE WANT TO GO WITH, SO THAT COULD BE 
20:42:58 SOMETHING THAT WE PUT IN HERE.

20:43:06 BUT GENERALLY IT'S WHEN THE PEDESTRIAN WANTS TO CROSS, THEY ACTIVATE THE BEACON, AND THIS HAS BEEN ONE OF OUR 
20:43:14 SORT OF BEST SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS, AND WE'VE BUILT PROBABLY CLOSE TO 20 OF THESE IN THE RECENT PAST IN FREMONT TO 
20:43:19 REALLY IMPROVE SAFETY FOR PEDESTRIANS CROSSING BUSY STREETS.

20:43:20 >> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.

20:43:27 NOW, IS THERE ANYBODY THAT IS ON THE CALL FROM THE MOBILITY COMMISSION?

20:43:29 I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THEIR  WEIGH-IN ON THIS.

20:43:41 >> Mr. Larsen: I KNOW THE MOBILITY COMMISSION IS AWARE OF THIS MEETING, AND MANY COMMISSIONERS HAVE BEEN IN 
20:43:45 ATTENDANCE AT THE PAST COMMUNITY MEETINGS.

20:43:53 JUST A QUICK SCAN, I SEE AT LEAST ONE.

20:44:01 >> Councilmember Cox: I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR THEIR OPINION BECAUSE I DON'T SEE A REPORT ATTACHED WITH THEIR COMMENTS 
20:44:04 ON WHETHER THEY'RE RECOMMENDING OR NOT RECOMMENDING THIS PROJECT.

20:44:13 >> Mr. Larsen: SO I SEE ONE MEMBER OF THE MOBILITY COMMISSION.

20:44:20 >> Mayor Mei: THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING AFTER FOR THE DISCUSSION, I THINK IF THEY HAVE A REPORT, WE CAN SEE IF THEY 
20:44:23 CAN COLLATE OR SEE IF THEY HAD ANYTHING FROM THE COMMISSION.

20:44:31 THEY WERE AT THE DIFFERENT COMMUNITY MEETINGS.

20:44:35 I THINK IN TOTAL, HANS, DID WE HAVE FOUR COMMUNITY MEETINGS?

20:44:36 >> Mr. Larsen: YES.

20:44:42 >> Mayor Mei: BECAUSE I KNOW I EITHER ATTENDED IN PERSON OR DIALED IN, AND I THINK RICK WAS AT SOME OF THOSE, 
20:44:47 COUNCILMEMBER JONES, BECAUSE WE HAD SEVERAL OF THOSE MEETINGS.

20:44:49 AND I KNOW SEVERAL OF THE MOBILITY COMMISSION MEMBERS WERE THERE.

20:44:55 BUT I DON'T KNOW IF THEY HAD PREPARED A REPORT FOR THIS EVENING OR ANYTHING ELSE.

20:45:01 >> Mr. Larsen: WE GENERALLY -- I THINK KIND OF THE ROLE OF THE MOBILITY COMMISSION IS IT'S MORE OF A -- KIND 
20:45:08 OF A SOUNDING  BOARD, ADVISOR ON SORT OF TOPICS THAT WE SHOULD CONSIDER.

20:45:17 PART OF THEIR MISSION IS NOT TO BE A POLICY-MAKING BODY, NOT LIKE THE PLANNING COMMISSION WHERE THEY GET 
20:45:20 INTO A LOT OF DETAIL --

20:45:21 >> Councilmember Cox: I UNDERSTAND THAT, YES.

20:45:22 I UNDERSTAND THAT.

20:45:31 >> Mr. Larsen: THEY MEET QUARTERLY, AND THERE'S A CERTAIN WORK PLAN THAT THEY HAVE, AND IT'S GENERALLY NOT TO 
20:45:32 RECOMMEND POLICY TO THE CITY COUNCIL.

20:45:34 >> Councilmember Cox: NO, I UNDERSTAND THAT.

20:45:36 THAT'S THE ROLE OF CITY COUNCIL.

20:45:43 I JUST THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO GET A WELL-ROUNDED FEEDBACK BECAUSE THEY DO REPRESENT THE PEOPLE THAT WALK, 
20:45:52 RIDE, BIKE, PARTICIPATE WITH OUR WALK AND ROLL TO SCHOOL PROGRAM AND OTHER THINGS THAT WE ALL WORK TOGETHER IN 
20:45:59 THE COMMUNITY, AND I THINK IT'S INVALUABLE INPUT THAT WE SHOULD HAVE HAD SOMEONE ON THIS CALL TONIGHT TO 
20:46:08 VOICE THAT, TO GIVE US ANOTHER PERSPECTIVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE MEETING THE NEEDS OF OUR MOBILITY 
20:46:08 COMMUNITY.

20:46:17 DID WE EVEN CHECK IN WITH OUR SENIOR CITIZENS COMMISSION TO EVEN SEE HOW THIS MAY BE ADOPTABLE OR OUR HUMAN 
20:46:20 RELATIONS COMMISSION, DID THEY WEIGH IN ON ANY OF THIS EITHER?

20:46:25 >> Mr. Larsen: NO, THIS IS NOT AN ITEM FOR THE SENIOR CITIZENS COMMISSION.

20:46:35 >> Mayor Mei: I JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY THAT ALL OF OUR AGENDA ITEMS ARE PUBLISHED ON THE THURSDAY BEFOREHAND, 
20:46:36 AND WE  DO --

20:46:38 >> Councilmember Cox: WE UNDERSTAND THAT, LILY.

20:46:38 THANK YOU.

20:46:47 IT'S JUST THE POINT OF JUST HAVING A WELL-ROUNDED APPROACH NA I'M ASKING TO SEE WHO ELSE HAD WEIGHED IN BESIDES 
20:46:54 THIS INDIVIDUAL REPORT AND GETTING SOME OF OUR CITIZENS THAT SIT ON OUR COMMISSION THAT, YES, IT IS PUBLISHED, 
20:47:03 YES, THEY ARE WELCOME TO ATTEND AT ANY TIME AND TO VOICE THEIR OPINION, BUT I JUST THOUGHT IT WOULD BE RIGHT ON TIME 
20:47:13 JUST TO SEE WHO ELSE HAD CHECKED IN ON THIS PROJECT SO THAT TO BE ADVISED BY OUR CITY COUNCIL TO BE ABLE TO HELP US 
20:47:14 JUST GET SOME INPUT.

20:47:19 I'M NOT LOOKING FOR A FORMAL REPORT, JUST SAYING, HEY, THESE ARE SOME GOOD THINGS, THESE ARE THINGS TO WATCH OUT 
20:47:23 FOR, JUST BASE BEING, AND GUIDANCE ON THAT ASPECT OF IT.

20:47:32 I ALSO WANTED -- I AM A LITTLE BIT CONCERNED ABOUT THE TIMING AND THE COST OF THE MATERIAL THAT IT'S GOING 
20:47:43 TO TAKE ONCE YOU GET THE DESIGN, THE LEAD TIME ON GETTING THESE MATERIALS IN ON TIME.

20:47:50 AS WE ALL KNOW, FROM THE BEACON LIGHTS THAT WE HAVE THE CHIPS ARE WELL BEHIND IN THE  DELIVERIES.

20:47:58 AND EVERYTHING IS SKYROCKETING 30 TO 50% ON THE PRICE AND THE DELIVERIES ARE THREE TO FOUR MONTHS BEHIND.

20:48:08 AND WITH THIS GRANT MONEY, I JUST WANTED TO HAVE SOME ASSURANCES, HANS, AND YOUR TEAM IN TERMS OF HOW WE'RE 
20:48:14 GOING TO BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE MEETING THESE TIME LINES THAT ARE CALLED OUT IN THESE GRANTS.

20:48:22 AND WE KNOW THAT IT'S A TIGHT DELIVERY IN GETTING THIS ALL IN AND MAKING THIS HAPPEN, AND IS THERE ANY PENALTIES OR 
20:48:32 ANYTHING THAT COULD OCCUR IN THE PROCESS OF ADDRESSING ALL OF THE SUPPLY CHAIN CHALLENGES THAT ARE GOING 
20:48:41 ON RIGHT NOW AND THE COST OF THE MATERIAL, BECAUSE THAT COULD TAKE THE 7.7 INTO A MUCH MORE HIGHER, YOU KNOW, 
20:48:49 PRICE FOR THIS PROJECT, OVERALL TOTAL COST, BUT AT THE SAME TIME, HOW MUCH HAVE WE BUILT IN, I GUESS, A SLACK OR 
20:48:55 SOME SORT OF COVERAGE IN THIS TYPE OF ARENA AS THE PRICES ARE BEING MARKED UP RIGHT NOW.

20:48:58 WE'RE BUYING AT THE MOST EXPENSIVE TIME.

20:49:02 >> Mr. Larsen: YEAH, AND I CONCUR.

20:49:09 THERE ARE DELAYS IN GETTING MATERIALS TO BUILDED PROJECT, IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT'S A TIME RISK FOR US, ESSENTIALLY 
20:49:14 THE TIME RISK IS WE HAVE TO HAVE THE PROJECT READY TO BID FOR CONSTRUCTION.

20:49:30 SO WE CAN MEET THAT DEADLINE IF WE HAVE A DIRECTION FOR THIS PROJECT, LITERALLY NOW OR VERY SOON.

20:49:36 I THINK IN TERMS OF THE COST, THERE'S SOME FLEXIBILITY THAT WE HAVE IN THE DESIGN PROCESS TO SCOPE THE PROJECT IN 
20:49:41 A WAY THAT WORKS WITHIN THE AVAILABLE GRANT MONEYS THAT WE HAVE.

20:49:53 THERE IS MATCHING FUNDS THAT WE DO PROVIDE FOR THE PROJECT, AND WE HAVE CONTINGENCIES TO DEAL WITH, 
20:50:04 UNANTICIPATED EXPENSES, BUT I THINK THE MESSAGE HERE IS, WE CAN DELIVER A VERY GOOD PROJECT WITHIN THE TIMELINE AND 
20:50:06 THE BUDGET THAT WE HAVE FROM THE GRANT.

20:50:14 IT A $7.7 MILLION GRANT, AND SO THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT THAT WE'RE MAKING IN THE CORRIDOR, AND THAT DOES 
20:50:17 INCLUDE FREMONT BOULEVARD AND THORNTON.

20:50:21 SO THERE'S NOT REALLY ANY CONTROVERSY IN THE THORNTON  AREA.

20:50:26 A LOT OF GOOD IMPROVEMENTS THERE THAT MAKE IT SAFER FOR SCHOOL ACCESS.

20:50:37 BUT I KNOW -- WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAPTURE THESE FUNDS AND GET IMPROVEMENTS FOR THIS PART OF THE 
20:50:38 FREMONT COMMUNITY.

20:50:43 >> Councilmember Cox: WA IS THE TIMELINE IN LETTING THEM KNOW THAT WE'RE INTERESTED OR -- YOU ALREADY 
20:50:46 APPLIED FOR IT AND NOW THE MONEY IS AVAILABLE TO UTILIZE IT?

20:50:49 IS THAT -- I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND.

20:50:52 >> Mr. Larsen:  -- COMMITTED TO US --

20:50:54 >> Councilmember Cox: LETTER OF INTENT RECEIVED, OKAY.

20:51:01 >> Mr. Larsen: SO WE HAVE THE COMMITMENT AND IT HAS FUNDED THE COMMUNITY OUTREACH EFFORTS THAT WE'VE 
20:51:11 BEEN ENGAGED IN, THE PLANNING WORK, AND SO YEAH, THIS IS GRANT MONEYS GUARANTEED TO US, IF WE CAN DELIVER ON 
20:51:12 TIME.

20:51:13 >> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.

20:51:14 THANK YOU.

20:51:21 >> Councilmember Kassan: I HAVE A REALLY QUICK QUESTION AND THAT IS, IF WE DID VOTE TONIGHT TO GO FOR THE 
20:51:26 THREE LANE PLAN, WOULD THAT DELAY BE ABLE TO MEET THE TIMELINE?

20:51:28 >> Mr. Larsen: NO.

20:51:37 I MEAN, THAT WOULD -- YOU KNOW, THAT'S -- I THINK THAT'S SORT OF THE BIG DIRECTION OF WHAT CAN WE DO WITH THIS.

20:51:47 TWO LANES, THREE LANES, FOUR LANES, I THINK JUST FROM A PERSPECTIVE TO KIND OF OVERCOME WHAT WE'VE HEARD AS VERY 
20:51:54 SIGNIFICANT OPPOSITION, I THINK CREATES SOME RISK OF CONTROVERSY OVER THE PROJECT.

20:51:59 I MAY BE WRONG, MAYBE THERE'S CONTROVERSY OVER KEEPING IT FOUR LANES.

20:52:05 SO THAT'S WHY WE'RE BRINGING IT FORWARD AND LOOKING FOR DIRECTION FROM COUNCIL.

20:52:16 BUT I THINK OUR RECOMMENDATION IS BASED ON WHAT WE FEEL IS I THINK A REALLY SIGNIFICANT CONCERN WITH HOW THE 
20:52:27 CORRIDOR OPERATES WITH REDUCING A LANE AND THE SORT OF DISRUPTION EFFECT DUE TO THE MANY RAILROAD CROSSINGS, AND 
20:52:36 THE FACT THAT WE'VE GENERATED THIS LEVEL OF CONCERN IN A CONDITION WHERE TRAFFIC VOLUMES ARE 30% LOWER THAN 
20:52:47 WHAT THEY MIGHT NORMALLY BE CONCERNS US THAT IF WE DID DO THE LANE REDUCTION, WE WOULD BE HEARING VERY SIGNIFICANT 
20:52:55 OUTCRY FROM THE COMMUNITY OVER THE TYPES OF TRAFFIC IMPACTS THAT ARE THERE, AND WE DON'T FEEL LIKE THIS IS 
20:53:00 SOMETHING THAT THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY FEELS IS A DIRECTION WE WANT TO GO.

20:53:07 SO I THINK IF THERE'S ANYTHING WE'VE BEEN ORIENTED TOWARDS MAKING THIS BETTER FOR THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY, AND 
20:53:17 SO WITHOUT SORT OF THEIR STRONG SUPPORT OR INTEREST IN A PARTICULAR DIRECTION, WE DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S -- THE 
20:53:20  THREE-LANE OPTION IS REALLY A WORKABLE SOLUTION.

20:53:28 >> Mayor Mei: SO I HAVEN'T ASKED MY QUESTIONS YET, SO I WANTED TO CLARIFY THAT I KNOW THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT THE 
20:53:36 TIME FRAME FOR THIS BEING -- TO BE IMPLEMENTED TIME FRAME FOR MEETING THE FUNDING.

20:53:44 I THINK THAT FROM -- HAVE WE DONE STUDIES OR AS PART OF OUR ORIGINAL SAFE ROUTES TO SCHOOL FOR THORNTON, DO 
20:53:48 THOSE INCORPORATE THOSE INTO THE CONCERN OF THE DESIGN?

20:53:49 >> Mr. Larsen: YES, THEY DO.

20:54:00 AND I THINK ONE OF THE KEY FEATURES OF THE PROJECT IS BUILDING A NEW TRAFFIC SIGNAL AT THORNTON AND OAK, WHICH IS 
20:54:04 RIGHT AT THE FRONT OF THE THORNTON MIDDLE SCHOOL.

20:54:13 WHICH IS TRANSITIONING FROM A TWO-GRADE JUNIOR HIGH TO A THREE-GRADE MIDDLE SCHOOL AND SO BEING ABLE TO BETTER 
20:54:20 SORT OF MANAGE TRAFFIC AND SAFETY AND PEDESTRIAN CROSSINGS THERE IS SOMETHING THAT WE THINK IS VERY 
20:54:24  IMPORTANT, A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF THE PROJECT.

20:54:24 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

20:54:35 ALSO TO CLARIFY, I BELIEVE  THAT -- DID WE USE FUNDING FOR ONE TIME, I BELIEVE SECURED THROUGH ACTC THROUGH OUR  
20:54:41 ONE-TIME IMPROVEMENTS TO RESPOND TO COVID RESPONSIVENESS TO USE THE TEMPORARY RESTRUCTURING IN TERMS OF 
20:54:47 PAINT AND SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS, SOME OF THE  OUTPUTS, IF I REMEMBER  CORRECTLY, DID WE USE FUNDING FROM THE 
20:54:51 ONE-TIME SOURCE TO HELP ADDRESS THIS FOR A PILOT PROJECT TO DEMONSTRATE THIS?

20:54:55 

20:55:00 >> Mr. Larsen: YES, WE'RE ACTUALLY FORTUNATE THAT SORT OF AT THE TIME, WE WERE DEBATING TWO, THREE, FOUR LANES 
20:55:11 AND LET'S TRY OUT THE THREE, ACTC RELEASED A GRANT PROGRAM TO DO SORT OF POP-UP PATIOS AND THINGS THAT COULD 
20:55:13 HELP COMMUNITIES RESPOND FROM COVID.

20:55:25 AND SO THAT ALLOWS USES TO HAVE SOME RESOURCES TO DO THE TWO POP-UP PATIOS THAT WE DID INSTALL, ONE AT ARTIST 
20:55:40 WALK AND ONE IN FRONT OF THE DAFGANHAN RESTAURANT TO MAKE THE PROJECT EVEN BETTER.

20:55:46 >> Mayor Mei: DID WE DO OUTREACH ALSO TO THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS, SUCH AS CENTERVILLE 
20:55:53 BUSINESS DISTRICT ASSOCIATION, AS WELL AS I THINK WE REACHED OUT TO SEVERAL OF THE BUSINESSES THEMSELVES, 
20:55:59 CERTAINLY ALONG THE CORRIDOR FROM ARTIST WALK AND SOME OF THOSE OTHER ONES, WHICH INCLUDES OUR VICE MAYOR 
20:56:04 WHO HAD TO RECUSE HIMSELF AS WELL AS OTHERS ALONG THAT CORRIDOR.

20:56:11 BECAUSE IT'S BEEN A LONGSTANDING QUESTION IN TERMS OF FEEDBACK, AND I'D ALSO CHECK, DID WE REACH OUT TO THE 
20:56:17 SCHOOLS ALONG THAT CORRIDOR IS CENTERVILLE, AND ALSO THE PARENTS, AGAIN, GOING TO THORNTON AS WELL AS 
20:56:19 THOSE GOING TO AMERICAN ON A DAILY BASIS.

20:56:27 AND SO THAT WAS REASONS -- I THINK THAT WAS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY YOU SITED EARLIER, IF I'M CORRECT.

20:56:30 >> YEAH, SO JUST KIND OF TWO ANSWERS.

20:56:39 SO WITH THE BUSINESS GROUPS, AND WE DID HAVE TWO SEPARATE BUSINESS FOCUS GROUPS THAT WERE JUST FOR THE 
20:56:47 BUSINESSES TO GET THEIR INPUT AND DESIRES TO UNDERSTAND THAT BECAUSE THAT WAS AN IMPORTANT STAKEHOLDER 
20:56:54 GROUP IN ADDITION TO THE GENERAL MEETINGS, AND THEN AS PART OF THE COMMUNITY MEETINGS, THE EARLIER ONES 
20:57:04 WERE A BIT MORE IN A WORKSHOP FORMAT, AND WE DID INCLUDE, INVITE AND HAVE PARTICIPATION FROM THE FREMONT SCHOOLS 
20:57:05 IN THE AREA.

20:57:07 >> Mayor Mei: RIGHT.

20:57:07 THANK YOU.

20:57:10 I THINK AT THIS TIME --

20:57:14 >> Mr. Larsen: IF I COULD MAYBE, MAYOR, JUST BEFORE WE GO TO BREAK, JUST SORT OF RECAP SORT OF WHAT THE 
20:57:16 RECOMMENDATION IS.

20:57:16 >> Mayor Mei: SURE.

20:57:25 >> Mr. Larsen: SO IT'S REALLY ON THE QUESTION OF THE NUMBER OF LANES WE SHOULD HAVE ON FREMONT, AND THAT'S -- 
20:57:26 OUR RECOMMENDATION IS TO RETAIN FOUR LANES.

20:57:31 IT'S CURRENTLY IN A THREE-LANE CONFIGURATION AS PART OF THE DEMONSTRATION, WE'RE RECOMMENDING 
20:57:41 GOING BACK TO FOUR AND THEN BUILDING THE COMPLETE STREET PROJECT USING THE GRANT BASED ON A FOUR-LANE STREET AS 
20:57:41 OPPOSED TO SOMETHING DIFFERENT.

20:57:51 SO THAT'S REALLY KIND OF THE SIMPLE ACTION BEFORE US TODAY, IS IF WE'RE COMFORTABLE CHOOSING A DESIGN 
20:57:55 DIRECTION ON THE NUMBER OF LANES, BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE NEED IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO MOVE ON WITH THE DESIGN 
20:57:56 PROCESS.

20:58:05 >> Mayor Mei: AND IF I COULD  ADD, I THINK WHEN I LOOKED AT THE MAPS AND THE DIAGRAMS IS THAT WHILE WE'RE 
20:58:10 MOVING TO FOUR LANES, WE ARE MAKING STREET IMPROVEMENTS SPECIFICALLY ON CROSSWALKS IN AREAS THAT WOULD THEN 
20:58:18 ALLOW FOR SAFER PEDESTRIAN OPTIONS AND ALSO IN TERMS OF THE ACCESSIBILITY, WHICH I THINK IS IMPORTANT TO SLOW THE 
20:58:23 TRAFFIC IN THAT AREA IN SOME WAYS, BUT NOT THE SAME WAY IN TERMS OF LOSS OF LANE AND TRAVEL.

20:58:28 SO WITH THAT, WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A 10-MINUTE BREAK, AND WE'LL RETURN AT 9:10.

20:58:30 THANK YOU.

20:58:37 PLEASE TURN OFF YOUR VIDEO AND YOUR -- SILENCE YOUR MIC.

20:58:38 THANK YOU.

20:58:41 [RECESS]

20:58:44 






20:58:48 



21:10:24 [ RECESS ]

21:10:25 >> Mayor Mei:   WELCOME BACK.

21:10:49 AND AT THIS POINT I'D LIKE TO 

21:10:51 TURN TO CLARIFYING QUESTIONS 

21:10:52 FROM THE AUDIENCE FOR THIS 

21:10:53 AGENDA ITEM.

21:10:55 SO I KNOW THAT'S GOING TO BE A 

21:10:56 LITTLE BIT TRICKY BUT THIS IS

21:11:02 STREETS, WHICH IS THE 

21:11:04 CENTERVILLE COMPLETE STREETS 

21:11:04 PROJECT.

21:11:07 SO I'M NOT SURE HOW WE CAN BEST 

21:11:10 WORK THIS MS. GAUTHIER, BUT 

21:11:11 GOING TO BE LOOKING FOR PEOPLE 

21:11:13 SPEAKING ON THIS TOPIC BECAUSE 

21:11:15 IT'S AN AGENDIZED ITEM BEFORE WE

21:12:18  VICE MAYOR SALWAN 

21:12:21 WHO HAS RECUSED.

21:12:22 >> THE FIRST PUBLIC SPEAKER FOR

21:12:27 >> Mayor Mei:   AND JUST TO 

21:12:29 CLARIFY IT IS FOR CENTERVILLE 

21:12:31 COMPLETE STREETS.

21:12:31 >> CORRECT.

21:12:33 >> OKAY CAN YOU HEAR ME?

21:12:35 >> YOU ARE SPEAKING ON THE 

21:12:35 CENTERVILLE ITEM.

21:12:38 >> HELLO, HI, HELLO ALL THE 

21:12:39 COUNCILMEMBERS, I'M A RESIDENT 

21:12:42 OF WARM SPRINGS, AND ACTUALLY 

21:12:44 THERE WAS NOT ENOUGH TIME FOR US 

21:12:47 TO DISCUSS THE HOMEKEY PROJECT 

21:12:49 JUST NOW SO I'M STILL ON THE WAY 

21:12:52 TO A BIG CONCERN ON THIS.

21:12:53 AS WELL AS THE COMMUNICATION ON 

21:12:56 THAT COMMUNITY OF WARM SPRINGS.

21:12:59 >> SIR WE'RE NOT ON THAT ITEM.

21:13:02 >> PLEASE LISTEN TO OUR OPINION.

21:13:04 >> IS HE MUTED?

21:13:06 >> SORRY I'VE DONE SO.

21:13:08 SIR WE WILL COME BACK TO PUBLIC 

21:13:09 COMMENT FOR ORAL COMMUNICATIONS 

21:13:11 AFTER WE HEAR THIS PARTICULAR 

21:13:11 ITEM.

21:13:14 WE ARE ON CENTERVILLE COMPLETE 

21:13:15 STREETS PROJECT.

21:13:16 UNDER PUBLIC COMMENT.

21:13:17 FOR THAT ITEM ONLY.

21:13:24 VALERIE KELLY, ARE YOU SPEAKING 

21:13:25 ON THE CENTERVILLE STREET 

21:13:27 COMPLETE STREETS?

21:13:32 >> NO.

21:13:33 >> ALL RIGHT, PLEASE LOWER YOUR 

21:13:35 HAND WE'LL COME BACK TO YOU.

21:13:53 AGU, AGU ARE YOU SPEAKING ON 

21:13:55 CENTERVILLE COMPLETE STREETS?

21:13:57 >> NO, WE ARE ALSO ON THE 

21:13:59 HOMEKEY --

21:14:00 >> PLEASE LET ALL OFS TO THAT 

21:14:02 CURRENTLY HAVE THEIR HANDS 

21:14:04 RAISED THAT WANT TO SPEAK ON THE 

21:14:06 HOMEKEY ITEM OR ANYTHING ELSE 

21:14:07 OTHER THAN CENTERVILLE COMPLETE 

21:14:09 STREETS, PLEASE LOWER YOUR HAND.

21:14:11 WE'RE NOT TAKING COMMENT ON THAT 

21:14:11 ITEM AT THIS TIME.

21:14:34 VENETA VERMA.

21:14:35 >> THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO 

21:14:35 SPEAK.

21:14:37 AS YOU KNOW I LIVE VERY CLOSE TO 

21:14:39 CENTERVILLE AND I HAVE TO SAY 

21:14:40 THAT I AGREE WITH STAFF 

21:14:46 RECOMMENDATION OF FOUR LANES.

21:14:47 BECAUSE LOCAL BUSINESSES HAVE 

21:14:49 LOST MY BUSINESS BECAUSE I DO 

21:14:51 NOT WANT TO USE FREMONT 

21:14:51 BOULEVARD AT ALL.

21:14:55 IT HAS BEEN A NIGHTMARE TO USE 

21:14:56 FREMONT BOULEVARD.

21:14:58 UPCOMING HOUSING PROJECTS AND 

21:15:02 DENSITY OF HOUSING WILL NEED 

21:15:07 MORE ROIDZ NOT LESS.

21:15:11 MY OTHER POINT IS AC BUSES ARE 

21:15:13 NEEDED FOR COMMUNITY AND FOR 

21:15:16 FUTURE HOUSING PROJECTS AND FOR 

21:15:17 THE STUDENTS TOO.

21:15:19 IT TAKES LONGER TO REACH FROM 

21:15:21 ONE LOCATION TO ANOTHER.

21:15:25 AND WE NEED BETTER AC TRANSIT 

21:15:27 BUSES ON FREMONT BOULEVARD.

21:15:27 THANK YOU.

21:15:29 >> THANK YOU.

21:15:45 KATHY KIMBERLIN.

21:15:46 >> I'D LIKE TO START WITH 

21:15:47  

21:15:49 APPLAUDING HANS AND HIS TRACK 

21:15:51 RECORD ON TIME LINES AND 

21:15:51 OUTREACH.

21:15:53 IT'S BEEN INCREDIBLE.

21:15:55 THE BIG CHAL AS HANS WILL BACK 

21:15:57 UP IS THE RESPONSE.

21:16:00 THE RESPONSE IS MINIMAL.

21:16:07 AND USUALLY LATELY THE RESPONSE 

21:16:10 HAVE BEEN NEGATIVE.

21:16:11 IT'S HARD TO WELCOME IN A 

21:16:11 COMMUNITY.

21:16:16 THE BUSINESSES LIKE BON APPETITE 

21:16:20 AND HELLERS HAVE WATCHED THE 

21:16:21 ACCIDENTS HAPPENING, THAT'S WHY 

21:16:23 SOME OF US WERE HOPING TO SLOW 

21:16:26 DOWN THE TRAFFIC WITH DROASING 

21:16:26 THE LANES.

21:16:28 HOWEVER THE GENERAL PUBLIC WANTS 

21:16:30 TO GET THROUGH AND GET THROUGH 

21:16:30 FAST.

21:16:33 DECREASING THE LANES IS NOT 

21:16:35 GOING TO BE ACCEPTED.

21:16:37 I'M GOING TO RUN OUT OF TIME BUT 

21:16:38 THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK ON THIS.

21:16:49 >> THANK YOU.

21:16:50 >> NEXT SPEAKER IS ANNIE, ARE 

21:16:52 YOU SPEAKING ON COMPLETE 

21:16:52 STREETS?

21:16:53 >> YES.

21:16:54 I'M A FREMONT RESIDENT, I 

21:16:57 SUPPORT THE THREE LANE PLAN.

21:17:00 REDUCED DEMAND IS GOING TO OCCUR 

21:17:06 WHEN EXTRA WHEN LANES ARE 

21:17:10 DECREASED, CAPACITY ACTUALLY 

21:17:13 INCREASES WITH THE ACTUAL AMOUNT 

21:17:14 OF TRAFFIC IMPROVED.

21:17:17 I DIDN'T SEE ANY EMPIRICAL DATA, 

21:17:20 IT WAS AN UNREPRESENTED SURVEY.

21:17:21 WHEN WE'RE MAKING DECISIONS 

21:17:24 ABOUT ROADS IT'S IMPORTANT TO 

21:17:26 USE FACTS ABOUT TRAFFIC VOLUME 

21:17:27 NOT FEELINGS.

21:17:30 WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO GET PAST 

21:17:35 THE STREETS ARE FOR CARS ONLY, 

21:17:38 INHERENTLY, CARS CAN GO SO FAST.

21:17:41 IT IS NOT A BAD THING IF CARS GO 

21:17:43 SLOWER THROUGH A DENLSER MORE 

21:17:45 INCLUSIVE AREA.

21:17:48 REDUCED DEMANDS, LACK OFISM PEER 

21:17:51 CAL DATA AND THREE LACK OF 

21:17:52 INCLUSIVITY.

21:17:52 THANK YOU.

21:18:01 >> THANK YOU, NEXT SPEAKER IS 

21:18:02 CHUN.

21:18:04 >> WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, TAKING 

21:18:06 OUT A LANE IN A MAJOR STREET IN 

21:18:09 FREMONT, WAS AN UTTERLY STUPID 

21:18:10 IDEA.

21:18:11 SORRY TO SAY.

21:18:14 ALL RIGHT, IT IS AN UTTERLY 

21:18:14 STUPID IDEA.

21:18:16 SO PLEASE FIX IT.

21:18:17 RESTORE IT BACK TO FOUR LANES.

21:18:21 AND IF YOU DO NOT -- IF YOU 

21:18:23 THINK YOU DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH 

21:18:25 FEEDBACK FROM US TELLING YOU 

21:18:28 THAT IS IS A STUPID IDEA WE WILL 

21:18:29 GET YOU MORE FEEDBACK.

21:18:30 WE WILL.

21:18:41 THANK YOU.

21:18:43 >> ANDREAS.

21:18:49 >> GOOD EVENING, ANDREAS 

21:18:50 CADAVADY BIKE FREMONT.

21:18:55 THERE IS ACTUALLY INFORMATION, 

21:18:56 CITY OF FREMONT EQUITY CLED 

21:19:00 QUITE A FEW DATA FEEDBACK, THEY 

21:19:02 ALL SHOW THAT REDUCING LANES HAD 

21:19:05 NO EFFECT ON FEEDBACK.

21:19:08 YOU SEE A LOT OF THEM REFER TO 

21:19:10 CONDITIONS BEFORE THE ROAD DIET.

21:19:13 YOU ALSO SEE THAT PEOPLE 

21:19:15 BASICALLY ADJUSTED AND IF YOU GO 

21:19:17 THROUGH NOW ANY TIME YOU SEE IT 

21:19:19 ACTUALLY WORKS EVEN WHEN THE 

21:19:20 TRAINS ARE THERE.

21:19:21 PEOPLE HAVE ADAPTED.

21:19:23 PEOPLE ARE TAKING ALTERNATE 

21:19:24 ROUTES.

21:19:28 THE PROPOSAL IS FINE I THINK.

21:19:29 BUT FEWER LANES WOULD ACTUALLY 

21:19:31 BE A MUCH BETTER COMPLETE STREET 

21:19:33 AND THE DATA ACTUALLY SHOWS THAT 

21:19:34 IT WILL WORK.

21:19:35 THANK YOU.

21:19:38 >> THANK YOU.

21:19:41 THE NEXT SPEAKER IS FLAVIO.

21:19:45 >> YES, HELLO, MY NAME IS 

21:19:46 FLAVIO, I'M ALSO ONE OF TWO 

21:19:48 PEDESTRIAN REPRESENTATIVES ON 

21:19:49 THE MOBILITY COMMISSION AND I 

21:19:51 WANTED TO PROVIDE SOME COMMENTS 

21:19:53 ESPECIALLY FROM THE PEDESTRIAN 

21:19:54 SAFETY POINT OF VIEW.

21:19:56 SO FOR LANES ARE ALWAYS VERY 

21:19:58 PROBLEMATIC FOR PEDESTRIANS.

21:20:01 IF YOU CROSS THE CAR IN THE 

21:20:03 RIGHT LANE MIGHT STOP, THE CAR 

21:20:04 IN THE LEFT LANE DOESN'T.

21:20:06 IF IT'S REALLY BAD, THE PERSON 

21:20:08 WHO STOPPED FOR YOU GETS PASSED 

21:20:10 ON THE LEFT LANE SO IT'S ALWAYS 

21:20:13 DANGEROUS FOR PEDESTRIANS.

21:20:15 AND MIDSECTION CROSSINGS ARE 

21:20:16 GOING TO BE DIFFICULT.

21:20:20 I PREFER THE HAWK TRAFFIC LIGHTS 

21:20:22 MUCH MORE THAN JUST THE BY THE 

21:20:26  BEACONS.

21:20:29 I LIVE ONE MILE AWAY FROM 

21:20:31 CENTERVILLE AND THE REASON THE 

21:20:35 POP UP FAILED IS IT'S VERY LOUD 

21:20:36 AND TRAFFIC MOVES VERY, VERY 

21:20:37 FAST IN THAT AREA.

21:20:39 I THINK SIDEWALKS BEING SO 

21:20:40 NARROW THEY WON'T ENABLE THIS 

21:20:43 AREA TO BECOME VIBRANT, IF A 

21:20:44 FAMILY GOES THERE THEY WILL HAVE 

21:20:46 TO WALK BEHIND EACH OTHER.

21:20:55 THEY CANNOT WALK --

21:20:57 >> NEXT SPEAKER IS KELLY, KELLY 

21:20:58 A.

21:21:00 >> THANK YOU.

21:21:02 I'M VERY CONFUSED ABOUT HOW 

21:21:04 THESE REPORTS ARE WRITTEN, YOU 

21:21:05 KNOW, IF THERE'S ANY 

21:21:07 UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT IS THE 

21:21:08 CORRECT ENGLISH DEFINITION OF 

21:21:10 THE WORD RETAIN.

21:21:11 BECAUSE I WAS JUST DRIVING DOWN 

21:21:14 THE STREET THERE, TWO DAYS AGO, 

21:21:15 AND I SAW THREE LANES.

21:21:17 BUT SO HOW CAN YOU RETAIN FOUR 

21:21:18 LANES WHEN THERE'S THREE LANES 

21:21:21  

21:21:22 THERE RIGHT NOW.

21:21:24 VERY CONFUSING.

21:21:26 THE MAJOR DECISIONS NEED TO BE 

21:21:27 DATA BASED.

21:21:28 THE CITY DOESN'T HAVE ANY 

21:21:29 TRAFFIC COUNTS THOUGH.

21:21:32 THE WEBSITE SAYS THE TRAFFIC 

21:21:33 COUNTS ARE COLLECTED EVERY TWO 

21:21:35 TO THREE YEARS BUT TRAFFIC FLOW 

21:21:43 MAPS ARE DATED 2013, 15 AND 

21:21:46 27th, EVEN THOUGH WE'RE 

21:21:50 SUPPOSED TO BE DOING THIS EVERY 

21:21:51 THREE YEARS.

21:21:54 AND THE TRAIN EVENTS, RESPOND 

21:21:55 AND COORDINATE WITH THESE TRAIN 

21:21:57 EVENTS TO ADDRESS THE TRAIN 

21:21:58 EVENTS THROUGH TRAFFIC SIGNAL 

21:22:00 IMPROVEMENTS NOT JUST ADDING 

21:22:01 LANES AND DESTROYING 

21:22:01 PEDESTRIANS.

21:22:02 THANK YOU.

21:22:04 >> THANK YOU.

21:22:06 MR. UREGI.

21:22:09 >> YES, COUNCILMEMBERS, THANK 

21:22:10 YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO 

21:22:11 SPEAK OUT.

21:22:14 WE'RE SUPPORTIVE OF VISION ZERO 

21:22:16 WHICH IS A SAFETY MANDATE TO 

21:22:19 REDUCE PEDESTRIAN AND CYCLIST 

21:22:20 DEATHS ACROSS THE CITY.

21:22:22 THE WAY TO DO THAT IS TO REDUCE 

21:22:23 THE SPEED OF TRAFFIC MOVING 

21:22:25 THROUGH CITY AND THIS IS 

21:22:26 SOMETHING STAFF HAS BEEN WORKING 

21:22:28 ON FOR QUITE A PERIOD OF TIME.

21:22:31 WE'D LIKE TO SEE THE EXISTING 

21:22:34 THREE LANES MAINTAINED.

21:22:36 THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE.

21:22:38 IT IS A SLIGHT RESTRICTION IN 

21:22:41 THE FLOW OF TRAFFIC ON FREMONT 

21:22:42  

21:22:43 BOULEVARD.

21:22:45 WE WOULD LOVE TO SEE MORE 

21:22:48 EMPIRICAL DATA SHOWING THAT THE 

21:22:49 CONGESTION HAS OCCURRED AND 

21:22:50 CONTINUES TO OCCUR.

21:22:52 WE'D FINALLY LIKE TO SEE THE 

21:22:54 TRAFFIC LIGHTS AND THE SYSTEM 

21:22:56 MAINTAINING THE FLOW OF TRAFFIC 

21:22:57 ACTUALLY UPDATED ACROSS THE 

21:22:57 CITY.

21:22:59 THIS WOULD BE A GREAT TEST CASE 

21:23:01 FOR THIS PARTICULAR AREA.

21:23:02 THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

21:23:02 >> THANK YOU.

21:23:03 LAURA WINTER.

21:23:10 >> YES, GOOD EVENING.

21:23:13 I WOULD LIKE TO THANK STAFF FOR 

21:23:15 LISTENING TO US AND FOR 

21:23:17 RECOMMENDING RETURNING TO FOUR 

21:23:18 LANES.

21:23:21 I LIVE A QUARTER MILE FROM THE 

21:23:23 INTERSECTION OF PERALTA AND 

21:23:25 FREMONT BOULEVARD.

21:23:27 I WOULD LOVE TO BE ABLE TO GET 

21:23:29 TO AND FROM THE GROCERY STORE 

21:23:30 WHICH I NEED TO DO.

21:23:32 I TRAVEL THIS ROUTE EVERY DAY.

21:23:35 SINCE WORKING AT HOME WITH THE 

21:23:36 PANDEMIC I HAVE WALKED IT MUCH 

21:23:37 MORE.

21:23:39 IT'S A GREAT 45 MINUTE WALK TO 

21:23:45 THE POST OFFICE, EASY WALK TO 

21:23:46 DALE HARDWARE, DO IT ALL THE 

21:23:47 TIME.

21:23:49 I PARTICIPATED IN THIS VERY 

21:23:50 SCIENTIFIC SURVEY.

21:23:52 MY NEIGHBORS DID AS WELL, THIS 

21:23:54 SURVEY WAS AS SCIENTIFIC AND AS 

21:23:56 ACCURATE AS ANY OF THE OTHER 

21:23:58 SURVEYS THAT THE CITY HAS HAD.

21:24:00 SO I'D LIKE TO THANK STAFF FOR 

21:24:01 LISTENING TO US AND REQUEST THE 

21:24:03 CITY COUNCIL TO AGREE WITH STAFF 

21:24:05 RECOMMENDATION.

21:24:08 THANK YOU.

21:24:09 >> THANK YOU.

21:24:10 STEVE SCALA.

21:24:13 >> THANK YOU.

21:24:16 I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THE 

21:24:19 SIDEWALK WIDTHS UNDER THE PLAN 

21:24:21 ARE VERY MUCH ON THE LOW SIDE.

21:24:23 WHEN COMPARED TO THE PEDESTRIAN 

21:24:24 MASTER PLAN.

21:24:26 AND THE APPENDIX FOR A 

21:24:26 COMMERCIAL AREA.

21:24:28 I'M NOT SURE IF THAT'S GOING TO 

21:24:32 LEAD TO THE VIBRANT MAIN STREET 

21:24:33 THAT'S THE DRIVING FACTOR HERE.

21:24:35 ALSO, THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF 

21:24:38 DISCUSSION ON PARKING ON FREMONT 

21:24:40 BOULEVARD BUT ALL OF THE MAIN 

21:24:43 STREETS IN SAY MOUNTAIN VIEW OR 

21:24:48 SUNNYVALE THEY ALL HAVE AMPLE 

21:24:49 OFFSTREET PARKING AND HASN'T 

21:24:51 BEEN MENTIONED AS PART OF THE 

21:24:52 OVERALL PLAN.

21:24:53 SO I'M CONCERNED THAT WE'RE 

21:24:56 GOING TO GET A BIG STREET 

21:24:57 WITHOUT THE PARKING WE NEED 

21:24:59 BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T REALLY 

21:25:02 ANALYZED IT OFFSTREET AND WE 

21:25:03 PROBABLY WON'T GET THE SIDEWALKS 

21:25:05 THAT WE REALLY WANT FOR A 

21:25:06 VIBRANT MAIN STREET WITH THE 

21:25:08 FOUR LANES THAT ARE PROPOSED.

21:25:11 THANK YOU.

21:25:15 >> THANK YOU.

21:25:16 REVEREND WANDA JOHNSON.

21:25:24 REVEREND JOHNSON ARE YOU ON TO 

21:25:26 SPEAK ABOUT CENTERVILLE COMPLETE 

21:25:27 STREETS?

21:25:59 ARE YOU SPEAKING ON CENTERVILLE 

21:26:01 COMPLETE STREETS?

21:26:09 COMMITTEE, THANK YOU MAYOR MEI 

21:26:10 AND COUNCILMEMBERS FOR 

21:26:10 LISTENING.

21:26:15 I WAS VERY DISHEARTENED FROM 

21:26:17 HEARING THAT THERE IS TO NEED 

21:26:20 FOR INPUT FROM THE SENIOR 

21:26:20 COUNCIL.

21:26:22 THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE WHO HAVE 

21:26:25 ISSUES ON MOBILITY, BEING ABLE 

21:26:26 TO NAVIGATE THE STREETS.

21:26:28 I WOULD LIKE TO INVITE YOU TO 

21:26:33 CONNECT WITH US, AND SPEAK WITH 

21:26:35 THE SENIORS AND THOSE WITH 

21:26:38 MOBILITY ISSUES, AS WE HAVE VERY 

21:26:39 SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT NOT ONLY 

21:26:42 THIS AREA BUT OTHER AREAS OF THE 

21:26:43 FREMONT WHERE SENIORS CAN 

21:26:44 NAVIGATE SAFELY.

21:26:46 WE DO HAVE A TRANSPORTATION 

21:26:47 SUBCOMMITTEE.

21:26:48 IF YOU REACH OUT TO ME, I WILL 

21:26:50 MAKE THE APPROPRIATE 

21:26:50 CONNECTIONS.

21:26:51 THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

21:26:54 >> THANK YOU.

21:26:56 >> Mayor Mei:   I JUST WANTED TO 

21:26:58 NOTE BEFORE PEOPLE LEAVE, 

21:27:00 REVEREND JOHNSON, THAT WE DO 

21:27:01 HAVE AN OPENING ON OUR 

21:27:04 COMMISSION IF YOU KNOW PEOPLE

21:27:07 REPRESENTATIVE WHO IS FAIRT AND 

21:27:10 OTHER AREAS OR 

21:27:14 MOBILITY-CHALLENGED.

21:27:16 >> WE'LL COME BACK IF REVEREND 

21:27:19 WANDA JOHNSON IS UNMUTING TO 

21:27:21 SPEAK ON CENTERVILLE COMPLETE 

21:27:21 STREETS ITEM.

21:27:35 BRUCE BREWBAKER.

21:27:36 BRUCE ARE YOU SPEAKING ON 

21:27:39 CENTERVILLE COMPLETE STREETS?

21:27:41 WE'LL NEED YOU TO UNMUTE, 
PLEASE.

21:27:58 BRUCE.

21:28:00 MAYOR, NEITHER OF THESE PERSONS 

21:28:01 ARE UNMUTING.

21:28:04 WE JUST HAD SOMEBODY RAISE THEIR 

21:28:06 HAND -- 16 --

21:28:07 >> HELLO?

21:28:10 >> MS. JOHNSON, REVEREND 

21:28:11 JOHNSON.

21:28:13 >> YES, CAN YOU HEAR ME?

21:28:15 >> ARE YOU HERE TO SPEAK ON 

21:28:16 CENTERVILLE COMPLETE STREETS?

21:28:18 >> NO, I WANTED TO SPEAK ON THE 

21:28:19 OTHER ITEM.

21:28:20 >> WE'LL HAVE TO COME BACK TO 

21:28:21 THAT.

21:28:23 >> OKAY, THANK YOU.

21:28:24 >> BRUCE ONE LAST TIME TO ASK 

21:28:26 YOU TO UNMUTE FOR CENTERVILLE 

21:28:26 COMPLETE STREETS.

21:28:33 OKAY.

21:28:35 AND THE NUMBER 16502.

21:28:38 ARE YOU SPEAKING ON CENTERVILLE 

21:28:41 COMPLETE STREETS?

21:28:43 >> YES, MA'AM, THIS IS ONCE 

21:28:48 AGAIN, (SAYING NAMES) I'M ONLY 

21:28:49 GOING TO ASK ONE QUESTION.

21:28:52 ON THIS PUBLIC WORKS PROJECT IS 

21:28:54 THE CITY GOING TO PROVIDE 

21:28:57 OPPORTUNITY TO MINORITY 

21:28:59 CONSTRUCTION, TO WORK ON THIS 

21:29:01 PROJECT ONCE IT -- IF IT'S 

21:29:01 APPROVED?

21:29:02 THAT'S MY QUESTION.

21:29:08 THANK YOU SO MUCH.

21:29:09 >> ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU.

21:29:18 ALL RIGHT MAYOR YOU CAN CLOSE 

21:29:19 THE PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD.

21:29:20 >> Mayor Mei:   I'D LIKE TO 

21:29:22 CLOSE IT NOW SINCE THERE ARE NO 

21:29:23 OTHER PUBLIC COMMENTS.

21:29:25 AND I'LL TURN IT BACK TO 

21:29:28 COMMENTS FROM COMMISSIONER 

21:29:31  COUNCILMEMBER 

21:29:34 JONES WHO HAS HIS HAND RAISED 

21:29:35 FIRST.

21:29:35 >> Councilmember Jones:   THANK 

21:29:37 YOU, MADAM MAYOR.

21:29:39 I WOULD LIKE TO THANK HANS AND 

21:29:41 HIS TEAM FOR ALL THE WORK ON 

21:29:41 THIS PROJECT.

21:29:44 I KNOW THERE WAS DIFFICULTY 

21:29:45 MOVING FORWARD, ALTHOUGH IT WAS 

21:29:47 INITIALLY PROPOSED AS A PILOT 

21:29:48 PROGRAM.

21:29:49 IT LASTED A LITTLE BIT LONGER 

21:29:51 THAN WE EXPECTED BUT WE'RE IN 

21:29:52 COVID AND THINGS TAKE A LITTLE 

21:29:54 BIT LONGER THESE DAYS.

21:29:57 I DID HAVE ONE CLARIFYING 

21:29:58 QUESTIONS REGARDING THE WIDTH OF 

21:29:59 THE SIDEWALKS AND THE COMMENTS 

21:30:00 ABOUT THE STREET PARKING.

21:30:02 WE COULD ACTUALLY GET WIDER 

21:30:04 SIDEWALKS IF WE ELIMINATED 

21:30:06 STREET PARKING AND MADE IT ALL 

21:30:07 OFF-STREET.

21:30:10 AND IF I'M REMEMBERING CORRECTLY 

21:30:12 ALL OF THE BUSINESSES THAT FACE 

21:30:14 FREMONT BOULEVARD THAT WOULD 

21:30:16 BENEFIT FROM A WIDER SIDEWALK DO 

21:30:17 HAVE AVAILABLE OFF-STREET 

21:30:23 PARKING, IS THAT CORRECT?

21:30:25 >> Hans Larsen:   YES, ONE OF 

21:30:26 THE KIND OF THE GOALS FROM THE 

21:30:27 BUSINESS COMMUNITY WAS TO TRY 

21:30:30 OBRING IN MORE ON-STREET PARKING 

21:30:32 IN THE AREA.

21:30:35 AND SO ACTUALLY -- I MEAN WITH 

21:30:38 THE THREE LANE CONFIGURATION 

21:30:40 WE'RE ACTUALLY ABLE TO BRING IN 

21:30:41 MORE ON-STREET PARKING IN THE 

21:30:43 AREA OR USE SOME OF THAT AREA 

21:30:46 FOR POP-UP PATIOS.

21:30:48 AND SO PROBABLY THE MOST 

21:30:49 SIGNIFICANT KIND OF TRADEOFF 

21:30:52 BETWEEN THE THREE AND THE FOUR 

21:30:54 IS LANES IS MORE PARKING AND 

21:30:59 POP-UP PATIO OPPORTUNITIES.

21:31:01 THERE ARE -- WE DID SURVEYS OF 

21:31:02 AVAILABILITY OF PARKING IN THE 

21:31:03 GENERAL AREA.

21:31:06 AND THERE IS A LOT OF PARKING 

21:31:07 FOR THE DISTRICT.

21:31:09 IT'S JUST -- IT'S TUCKED BEHIND 

21:31:11 THE DIFFERENT BUILDINGS, AND AT 

21:31:15 THE TRAIN STATION, AND IT'S NOT, 

21:31:16 YOU KNOW, PROBABLY A PROJECT FOR 

21:31:18 THE FUTURE IS TO TRY ORGANIZE 

21:31:20 THE PARKING RESOURCES AND GUIDE 

21:31:23 PEOPLE TO WHERE IT IS, I DON'T 

21:31:25 THINK THE AREA HAS A PARKING 

21:31:25 PROBLEM.

21:31:28 IT'S MORE OF JUST MANAGING THE 

21:31:33 PARKING RESOURCES.

21:31:36 SO I'M SORRY THERE -- I'M NOT 

21:31:38 SURE I'M ANSWERING THE QUESTION.

21:31:40 WE DID TAKE A LOOK AT THAT AND, 

21:31:42 YOU KNOW, THE AMOUNT OF PARKING 

21:31:46 DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT YOU GET 

21:31:48 IN TERMS OF ADDED PARKING BY 

21:31:52 TAKING AWAY A LANE IS FAIRLY 

21:31:53 MINOR AND PART OF WHAT WE'RE 

21:31:56 LOOKING AT IS ARE YOU REALLY 

21:31:59 MOVING THE NEEDLE ON PARKING 

21:32:00 COMPARED TO THE KINDS OF ISSUES 

21:32:03 THAT YOU'RE INTRODUCING BY 

21:32:04 TAKING AWAY A LANE?

21:32:07 AND SO WE DIDN'T THINK SORT OF 

21:32:11 THE TRADEOFFS MET THAT, NOR 

21:32:12 REALLY, THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY 

21:32:14 FEEL LIKE IT WAS A GOOD 

21:32:15 TRADEOFF.

21:32:17 I MIGHT ADD DURING THE BREAK I 

21:32:18 DID TALK WITH STAFF ABOUT 

21:32:19 ADDITIONAL OUTREACH WITH THE 

21:32:20 BUSINESSES.

21:32:22 SO DURING THE ONE YEAR PERIOD OF 

21:32:25 THE DEMONSTRATION PROJECT, THERE 

21:32:27 WERE TWO MEETINGS WITH THE 

21:32:30 BUSINESS COMMUNITY INCLUDING THE 

21:32:31 CENTERVILLE COMMUNITY AND 

21:32:34 BUSINESS ASSOCIATION, AND SORT 

21:32:35 OF THE DIRECT FEEDBACK WE WERE 

21:32:37 HEARING FROM THEM WAS GENERALLY 

21:32:41 MOSTLY NEGATIVE ABOUT HOW THE 

21:32:41 DEMONSTRATION PROJECT WAS 

21:32:42 WORKING.

21:32:45 AND SO I THINK WE WERE TRYING TO 

21:32:47 DO SOMETHING THAT BENEFITED THE 

21:32:48 BUSINESS COMMUNITY.

21:32:49 WE'RE NOT REALLY SEEING THAT 

21:32:51 THEY SAW THE CHANGE WAS 

21:32:51 VALUABLE.

21:32:55 AND SO THAT WAS, YOU KNOW, A 

21:32:56 DRIVER TOWARDS OUR 

21:32:57 RECOMMENDATION.

21:32:59 I THINK IF I COULD MAKE ONE 

21:33:00 OTHER ADDED POINT.

21:33:03 THIS IS AN IMPORTANT AC TRANSIT 

21:33:03 BUS CORRIDOR.

21:33:06 WE DO HAVE A PROJECT TO TRY 

21:33:08 OIMPROVE TRANSIT SERVICE.

21:33:11 AND JUST THE LEVEL OF CONGESTION 

21:33:15 AND RECOVERY FROM THE TRAIN 

21:33:18 CROSSINGS REALLY DOES CREATE A 

21:33:19 SIGNIFICANT DISRUPTION TO THE 

21:33:22 OPERATIONS OF AC TRANSIT.

21:33:24 AND SO IF YOU'RE STUCK IN ONE 

21:33:26 LANE AND THE TRAFFIC'S BACKED 

21:33:28 UP, THAT BUS IS NOT GOING TO 

21:33:29 MOVE VERY FAST.

21:33:30 WE WILL DO EVERYTHING THAT WE 

21:33:34 CAN UNDER ANY SCENARIO TO WORK 

21:33:36 SIGNAL TIMING AND MODERNIZATION.

21:33:39 BUT AGAIN I THINK JUST THERE'S A 

21:33:42 BIG ISSUE WITH THE TRAIN 

21:33:42 CROSSINGS.

21:33:44 IT'S A TOUGH CHALLENGE IN THIS 

21:33:47 PARTICULAR LOCATION.

21:33:48 >> Councilmember Jones:   TO 

21:33:50 JUST TO CLARIFY, THE BUSINESSES 

21:33:51 SAID THEY WERE NOT REALLY 

21:33:53 BENEFITING FROM THE NARROWING OF 

21:33:55 THE LANES.

21:33:57 WOULD THEY ACTUALLY BENEFIT FROM 

21:33:59 ON-STREET PARKING OR WOULD IT BE 

21:34:02 A BETTER BENEFIT TO INCREASE THE 

21:34:04 WIDTH OF THE SIDEWALK?

21:34:07 I'M ALWAYS A LITTLE BIT LEERY OF 

21:34:09 CURB PARKING ON A CITY STREET 

21:34:11 LIKE THAT, BECAUSE PEOPLE TEND 

21:34:13 OOPEN THEIR DOORS INTO TRAFFIC.

21:34:15 I'VE LIVED AND WORKED HERE FOR 

21:34:17 OVER 40 YEARS AND I'M IN THAT 

21:34:21 AREA QUITE EXTENSIVELY AND I 

21:34:22 PARK FREQUENTLY ON PERALTA JUST 

21:34:24 OFF OF FREMONT TO GO INTO SOME 

21:34:25 OF THE BUSINESSES THERE.

21:34:27 AND I'M ALWAYS VERY LEERY ABOUT 

21:34:29 OPENING MY DOOR INTO TRAFFIC.

21:34:31 BUT, YOU KNOW, I KNOW THERE'S 

21:34:33 PLENTY OF OFFSTREET PARKING BUT 

21:34:35 THERE IS THAT TEMPTATION, I'M 

21:34:38 GOING TO PULL IN RUN IN AND COME 

21:34:39 OUT.

21:34:41 YOU HAVE TO BE EXTREMELY 

21:34:42 CAREFUL.

21:34:45 YOU MIGHT ACTUALLY BENEFIT FROM 

21:34:47 WIDENING THE SIDEWALKS, 

21:34:48 POTENTIALLY THAT SEARCH FEET 

21:34:50 WOULD ALLOW US TO WIDEN THE 

21:34:52 SIDEWALKS, WIDEN THE BIKE LANE 

21:34:54 ITSELF A LITTLE BIT IF NEED BE 

21:34:57 AND KEEP THE PARKED VEHICLES OFF 

21:35:00 OF FREMONT BOULEVARD.

21:35:01 BUT I THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT 

21:35:04 PART OF THIS DISCUSSION IS, 

21:35:05 WE'RE SUPPORTING OUR SMALL 

21:35:07 BUSINESSES AND OUR SMALL 

21:35:08 BUSINESSES APPARENTLY HAVE MADE 

21:35:10 IT VERY CLEAR THAT THEY ARE NOT 

21:35:13 IN FAVOR OF THE PILOT PROJECT, 

21:35:14 AND THEY WOULD LIKE IT RETURNED 

21:35:16 TO FOUR LANES.

21:35:17 I UNDERSTAND THE REASON THAT WE 

21:35:21 DID THIS WAS TO ALLOW FOR SOME 

21:35:24 POP-UP PATIO ACTIVITY WHICH 

21:35:26 APPARENTLY NEVER CAME TO PASS.

21:35:29 AND ALSO, TO ALLOW FOR MORE 

21:35:31 WALKABILITY.

21:35:33 AGAIN I TRAVEL THROUGH THAT AREA 

21:35:35 QUITE EXTENSIVELY AND I HONESTLY 

21:35:36 HAVE NOT SEEN A LOT OF 

21:35:37 PEDESTRIANS.

21:35:40 EVEN DURING THE SCHOOL HOURS.

21:35:43 AND WITH NO BUSINESSES 

21:35:46 BENEFITING FROM THE POP-UP PATIO 

21:35:47 AND THE ISSUES THAT YOU WERE 

21:35:48 TALKING ABOUT WITH THE 

21:35:53 CONGESTION FROM THE TRAIN AND IT 

21:35:54 NOT ONLY DELAYS THE DRIVERS BUT 

21:35:57 THE AC TRANSIT SERVICE, WOULD WE 

21:36:00 NOT BE -- WOULD IT NOT BE MORE 

21:36:02 BENEFICIAL TO KEEP IT A FOUR 

21:36:04 LANE ROADWAY AND MAYBE JUST 

21:36:05 TWEAK THOSE MEASUREMENTS A 

21:36:07 LITTLE BIT, YOU KNOW, THE OTHER 

21:36:09 THING I NOTICE IS WE HAVE 

21:36:12 BETWEEN THE BIKE LAIN AND THE 

21:36:13 SIDEWALK THERE IS ACTUALLY A 

21:36:15 FIVE FOOT SECTION FOR TREES I'M 

21:36:17 ASSUMING TO BE PLANTED.

21:36:19 IT'S LIMITED OR LAWBLED CURB 

21:36:20  

21:36:22  LAIBILITYD CURB 

21:36:24 PARKING OR CURB LANE.

21:36:27 I'M LOOKING AT THAT LIKE IT'S A 

21:36:29 LANDSCAPE AREA IS THAT CORRECT, 

21:36:31 THAT'S IN THE CROSS VIEW?

21:36:32 >> Hans Larsen:   YES, I THINK 

21:36:34 THE THING ABOUT THE WIDENING THE 

21:36:42 SIDEWALKS IS TO GENERALLY IN THE 

21:36:45 AREAS THAT EXIST YOU HAVE A 

21:36:47 SIDEWALK AND ADMITLY SOME OF THE 

21:36:48 AREAS ARE NARROW AND THEN YOU 

21:36:56 HAVE TREE PLANTINGS.

21:36:58 AND WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING IS YOU 

21:36:59 WOULD HAVE THE CURB LANE AND THE 

21:37:00 BIKE LANE.

21:37:02 THE PROPOSAL IS TO HE RATHER 

21:37:04 THAN HAVE THE BIKE LANE IN THE 

21:37:06 STREET RAISE THE BIKE LANE AND 

21:37:08 SORT OF EFFECTIVELY CREATES SORT 

21:37:10 OF A WIDER SIDEWALK AREA, WE 

21:37:14 WANTED TO -- TO WIDEN THE 

21:37:16 ACTUALITY SIDEWALK SPACE, THE 

21:37:18 TREES ARE IN THE WAY OF BEING 

21:37:19 ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY DO THAT.

21:37:21 SO GENERALLY I MEAN OUR PRACTICE 

21:37:23 AND STANDARD FOR THE CORRIDOR IN 

21:37:27 ORDER TO GET A WIDER AFFECTED 

21:37:32 SIDEWALK SPACE IS WHEN THERE'S 

21:37:33 AN OPPORTUNITY FOR A NEW 

21:37:35 DEVELOPMENT LIKE ARTIST WALK, 

21:37:38 LIKE THE FORMER SILICON SAGE 

21:37:41 DEVELOPMENT, THEIR BUILDING SET 

21:37:49 BACK IS MOVING BACK TO CREATE A 

21:37:51 WIDER SIDEWALK.

21:37:54 THAT'S HOW WE'RE GETTING WIDER 

21:37:55 SIDEWALKS AS DEVELOPMENT ALLOWS.

21:37:58 FOR THIS PROJECT TO COME IN AND 

21:38:00 WIDEN THE SIDEWALK THEN MEANS 

21:38:02 SORT OF THE -- HAVING TO MOVE 

21:38:07 THE TREES AND THAT CREATES A LOT 

21:38:09 MORE COMPLICATIONS.

21:38:11 SO WE'RE NOT NECESSARILY LOOKING 

21:38:13 AT SEEING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF 

21:38:17 JUST WIDENING THE SIDEWALK.

21:38:19 BUT, YOU KNOW, BRINGING MORE -- 

21:38:22 BRINGING THE BIKE LANES UP WHICH 

21:38:24 CREATES FURTHER SEPARATION OR A 

21:38:28  

21:38:30 BIGGER PEOPLE SPACE FROM WHERE 

21:38:32 THE PARKING IS.

21:38:33 THAT IS KIND OF THE THINKING 

21:38:37 BEHIND THE DESIGN CONCEPT.

21:38:37 >> Councilmember Jones:   TO ALL 

21:38:39 OF THE MEASURES IN THE CONCEPT 

21:38:41 ARE PRETTY MUCH IN LINE OF WHAT 

21:38:44 WE WANTED TO DO WITH REGARD TO 

21:38:45 COMPLETE STREETS PROJECT AND 

21:38:48 ALSO IN TERMS OF VISION ZERO?

21:38:49 >> Hans Larsen:   YES, I THINK 

21:38:52 BIGGEST PEDESTRIAN BENEFITS, 

21:38:55 FROM A SAFETY PERSPECTIVE, AND 

21:38:56 FOR A BUSINESS DISTRICT IS TO BE 

21:38:59 ABLE TO HAVE FREQUENT SAFE 

21:39:00 CROSSING POINTS.

21:39:03 SO YOU PARK SOMEWHERE, YOU GO TO 

21:39:05 ONE SHOP, AND THEN YOU WANT TO 

21:39:07 GET ACROSS THE STREET, PROBLEM 

21:39:09 THE CORRIDOR HAS IS THE BIG 

21:39:10 SEPARATION BETWEEN THE TRAFFIC 

21:39:11 SIGNALS.

21:39:13 SO TO MAKE IT MORE 

21:39:14 PEDESTRIAN-FRIENDLY, THE 

21:39:17 FEATURES THAT ARE IN THE 

21:39:20 PROJECTS ARE TO SORT OF BREAK UP 

21:39:22 THE LONG BLOCKS AND INTRODUCE 

21:39:24 MORE SAFE CROSSING LOCATION HE.

21:39:26 SO THAT'S SORT OF THE BIG 

21:39:28 BENEFIT FOR THE PEDESTRIANS.

21:39:31 FOR THE BIKES, IT'S TO DEAL WITH 

21:39:33 SEPARATED BIKEWAY THAT'S 

21:39:35 ELEVATED AND THEN FOR TRANSIT IS 

21:39:37 TO HAVE BETTER BUS SHELTERS AND 

21:39:40 HAVE THE LOADING WITHIN THE 

21:39:40 LANE.

21:39:43 I MEAN THAT WILL ACTUALLY STOP 

21:39:45 TRAFFIC FOR SMALL PERIOD OF TIME 

21:39:47 YOU'RE DOING A BUS LOADING.

21:39:49 BUT NOW THE BUS DOESN'T HAVE TO 

21:39:56 SORT OF WEAVE IN AND OUT OF 

21:39:57 TRAFFIC.

21:40:02 IT FULTS BASICALLY THE BUS 

21:40:04 SHELTER AND WAITING AREA IN A 

21:40:06 WIDENED SIDEWALK AREA OR IN 

21:40:08 AREAS WHERE THERE IS ONSTREET 

21:40:10 PARKING, THERE WOULD BE A BUS 

21:40:11 LOADING ZONE AREA.

21:40:14 SO THAT'S THE -- I THINK THE 

21:40:17 COMPLETE STREET, TRANSIT GETS 

21:40:19 BETTER, WALKING IS SAFER 

21:40:20 PARTICULARLY FOR CROSSINGS AND 

21:40:22 THEN THE BIKE NETWORK IS BETTER.

21:40:24 SO THOSE ARE THE THREE ELEMENTS 

21:40:26 THAT MAKE UP WHAT WE SEE AS 

21:40:31 MOVING IT TOWARDS A STRONGER 

21:40:32 COMPLETE STREET.

21:40:33 >> Councilmember Jones:   OKAY.

21:40:35 AND FROM WHAT I SEE OF THIS PLAN 

21:40:36 IT MEETS ALL OF THOSE ELEMENTS, 

21:40:38 ALL OF THAT CRITERIA.

21:40:39 AGAIN, HAVING DRIVEN AND WALKED 

21:40:41 THIS AREA QUITE FREQUENTLY, I 

21:40:43 FOR ONE AM VERY APPRECIATIVE OF 

21:40:46 THE ENHANCEMENT OF THE CROSSWALK 

21:40:51 AREAS, PARTICULARLY AT BONDE AND 

21:40:52 FREMONT.

21:40:53 VERY DIFFICULT TO GET ACROSS.

21:40:57 IF A TRAIN IS THERE IT KIND OF 

21:40:58 DETRACTS.

21:41:00 IT'S KIND OF DIFFICULT.

21:41:01 I THINK THE TELLING FACTOR IN 

21:41:03 THIS IS THIS WAS DONE IN PART TO 

21:41:08 BENEFIT OUR BUSINESSES AND OUR 

21:41:10 BUSINESSES HAVE SAID THIS IS NOT 

21:41:13 REALLY GIVING A BENEFIT AND IT'S 

21:41:14 ACTUALLY CAUSING AN ISSUE.

21:41:17 AND THE ONLY ONE THAT HAS TAKEN 

21:41:20 ADVANTAGE OF THE POP UP PATIO IS 

21:41:22 THE AFGHAN RESTAURANT.

21:41:25 THEY WOULDN'T TAKE BENEFIT OF 

21:41:28 RETURNING TO FOUR LANES, WE 

21:41:30 HAVEN'T TOUCHED ANYTHING SOUTH 

21:41:32 OF PERALTA YET.

21:41:34 I'M VERY MUCH IN FAVOR OF TAKING 

21:41:35 IT BACK FOR THE BUSINESSES, 

21:41:37 THEY'RE THERE EVERY DAY, THEY 

21:41:40 SEE THE TRAFFIC BICYCLE 

21:41:42 PEDESTRIANS CARS WHAT HAVE YOU, 

21:41:45 A LOT OF THE ISSUES WITH THE 

21:41:45 BACKUPS PARTICULARLY THOUSAND 

21:41:47 THAT THINGS ARE STARTING TO 

21:41:50  OPEN 

21:41:51 UP AND GETTING KIDS BACK INTO 

21:41:53 SCHOOL AND THE TRANSITION TO 

21:41:55 THORNTON TO GO TO A MIDDLE 

21:41:57 SCHOOL LEVEL IS GOING TO CREATE 

21:41:58 MORE TRAFFIC.

21:42:01 CHOKING THAT NORTHBOUND 

21:42:03 DIRECTION TO ONE LANE IS GOING 

21:42:06 TO CAUSE SOME ISSUES, DELAY 

21:42:07 DRIVERS BUT ALSO THE BUS SERVICE 

21:42:08 AS WELL.

21:42:10 SO I WOULD BE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF 

21:42:12 TAKING THIS BACK TO FOUR LANES.

21:42:13 AND I KNOW THAT WE'RE.

21:42:21  IN A TIME 

21:42:26 CRUNCH DUE TO FUNDING 

21:42:28 CONSTRAINTS.

21:42:29 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

21:42:30 COUNCILMEMBER COX FOR YOUR 

21:42:31 COMMENTS.

21:42:31 >> Councilmember Cox:   YES, 

21:42:33 THERE WAS A GOOD QUESTION THAT 

21:42:34 WAS BROUGHT UP.

21:42:36 HOW ARE WE SOLICITING AND 

21:42:40  

21:42:42 ENCOURAGING THE SMALL BUSINESSES 

21:42:44 MINORITY OWNED BUSINESSES TO BE 

21:42:46 ABLE TO BID ON THIS TYPE OF 

21:42:47 WORK, HOW ARE WE OUTREACHING TO 

21:42:49 THEM?

21:42:50 >> Hans Larsen:   SO THIS 

21:42:52 PROJECT IS FUNDED WITH FEDERAL 

21:42:53 FUNDS.

21:42:55 SO WE WOULD FOLLOW THE POLICIES 

21:42:56 THAT THEY HAVE IN TERMS OF 

21:42:59 BIDDING.

21:43:04 I'M NOT -- I DON'T KNOW OFFHAND 

21:43:06 WHAT THE PARTICULAR OUTREACH IS.

21:43:11 I DON'T KNOW IF -- IF NOE IS ON, 

21:43:13 IF HE'S AWARE OF IT OR IF OUR 

21:43:15 CITY ATTORNEY IF SHE HAS SOME 

21:43:17 PARTICULAR EXPERIENCE OF WHAT WE 

21:43:18 DO OR WHAT THE FEDERAL 

21:43:20 REQUIREMENTS ARE IN TERMS OF 

21:43:24 BIDDING AND OUTREACH.

21:43:26 AND MAYBE WE'D JUST HAVE TO GET 

21:43:27 BACK TO YOU ON IT.

21:43:29 SO CERTAINLY NOT QUITE AT THAT 

21:43:30 POINT.

21:43:32 BUT WE'LL BASICALLY HAVE TO 

21:43:34 COMPLY WITH WHAT THE FEDERAL 

21:43:36 REQUIREMENTS ARE FOR FEDERALLY 

21:43:38 FUNDED PROJECTS.

21:43:39 >> Councilmember Cox:   BUT YOU 

21:43:40 SHOULD HAVE A LIST OF 

21:43:41 ORGANIZATIONS THAT YOU OUTREACH 

21:43:43 TO BE ABLE TO, YOU KNOW, NOTIFY 

21:43:45 THEM THAT THERE'S BIDDING AND 

21:43:46 CONTRACTING OPPORTUNITIES, 

21:43:46 RIGHT?

21:43:48 I MEAN YOU'RE GOING TO SEND IT 

21:43:49 OUT TO THE FREMONT CHAMBER, 

21:43:50 RIGHT?

21:43:53 I MEAN HISPANIC CHAMBER?

21:43:55 >> Hans Larsen:   I MEAN WE HAVE 

21:43:56 A BIDDERS INTEREST LIST.

21:43:59 SO FOR ALL THE PROJECTS THAT WE 

21:44:00 BIT OUT, ANYONE THAT'S 

21:44:02 INTERESTED IN BIDDING ON 

21:44:02 PROJECTS WITH THE CITY OF 

21:44:06 FREMONT, THEY SIGN UP TO GET 

21:44:09 NOTIFICATIONS WHEN WE HAVE WORK 

21:44:10 TO BE BID.

21:44:12 AND WE'LL SEND IT TO EVERYBODY 

21:44:15 THAT HAS AN INTEREST.

21:44:17 >> Councilmember Cox:   ARE YOU 

21:44:23 ON PERISCOPE RIGHT?

21:44:26 >> Hans Larsen:   I THINK 

21:44:30 BIDSYNC IS THE SYSTEM WE USED.

21:44:32 >> IT IS BIDSYNC YES.

21:44:34 >> Councilmember Cox:   IT USED 

21:44:35 TO BE PERISCOPE THAT CHANGED.

21:44:39 >> Mayor Mei:   OKAY.

21:44:43 NEXT FOR CLARIFYING COMMENTS, 

21:44:45 YANG SHAO, COUNCILMEMBER YANG 

21:44:48 SHAO.

21:44:48 >> Councilmember Shao:   THANK 

21:44:49 YOU, MADAM MAYOR.

21:44:51 FIRST OF ALL I WOULD LIKE TO 

21:44:54 JUST COMMEND THE STAFF FOR 

21:44:57 MAKING SUCH A GOOD EFFORTS, IN 

21:44:58 REACHING OUT TO THE COMMUNITIES.

21:45:02 I'VE SEEN YOUR SLIDES THAT YOU 

21:45:05 HAVE FOR THE COMMITTEE MEETINGS 

21:45:06 AS WELL AS THE SURVEYS.

21:45:09 NOT ONLY THAT YOU ALSO WENT OUT 

21:45:11 AND TRIED THE THREE-LANE MODEL 

21:45:14 AND TRIED OREALLY TAKE FEEDBACKS 

21:45:15 FROM EVERYONE INCLUDING THE 

21:45:17 SMALL BUSINESSES IN THE AREA.

21:45:20 SO CONSIDERING THAT WE'RE STILL 

21:45:22 ON THE PANDEMIC AND OUR 

21:45:23 RESOURCES ARE LIMITED, YOUR 

21:45:26 EFFORTS ARE CERTAINLY GREATLY 

21:45:28 APPRECIATED.

21:45:31 MORE IMPORTANTLY, THE FOUR LANE 

21:45:33 DESIGN IS COMPLETELY IN SYNC 

21:45:36 WITH OUR VISION ZERO MODEL.

21:45:41 AND ENCOURAGES MULTIMODAL TRAVEL 

21:45:43 INCLUDING BICYCLISTS AND 

21:45:43 PEDESTRIANS.

21:45:47 SO THAT CERTAINLY IS THE MERIT 

21:45:48 OF THE PROPOSAL.

21:45:54 THERE'S SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE 

21:45:57 QUALITY OF DATA IN THE SURVEY.

21:46:00 I WONDER LIKE IF YOU TRY TO 

21:46:02 INCLUDE ALL THE QUESTIONS 

21:46:10 INCLUDING THE SURVEY ANSWER 

21:46:14 PROVIDERS LIKE BACKGROUND, SEX, 

21:46:16 RACE, EDUCATION LEVEL, SO ON, 

21:46:18 IT'S GOING TO BE A LONG SURVEY 

21:46:24 MORE LIKE A CENSUS 

21:46:24 QUESTIONNAIRE.

21:46:26 AND TYPICALLY IT WOULD CERTAINLY 

21:46:28 PREVENT PEOPLE FROM ACTIVELY 

21:46:30 PARTICIPATING BECAUSE OF THE 

21:46:31 LONG QUESTIONNAIRE.

21:46:34 TALKING ABOUT THE LACK OF 

21:46:36 TRAFFIC DATA, I UNDERSTAND THAT 

21:46:39 ON ONE HAND, WE DEFINITELY NEED 

21:46:42 TO MAKE DECISIONS BASED ON DATA.

21:46:44 BUT THEN CONSIDERING THAT WE 

21:46:47 HAVE BEEN UNDER PANDEMIC FOR TWO 

21:46:50 YEARS, THE CURRENT DATA, 

21:46:54 WHENEVER WE COLLECT RECENTLY, IS 

21:46:57 NOT GOING TO BE CLOSE TO REALITY 

21:47:01 AFTER THE PANDEMIC IS OVER.

21:47:03 SO IN THAT CASE, WE HAVE TO 

21:47:06 UNDERSTAND THAT AT THIS MOMENT, 

21:47:08 WHATEVER DATA THAT WE CAN 

21:47:13 COLLECT, IS NOT CLOSE TO WHAT'S 

21:47:15 GOING TO BE IN THE FUTURE.

21:47:16 AND OF COURSE, ON THE OTHER 

21:47:19 HAND, WE CANNOT RELY OPEN OLD 

21:47:20 DATA WHICH CERTAINLY WOULD NOT 

21:47:23 REFLECT WHAT THAT AREA HAS BEEN 

21:47:24 CHANGING OVER THE YEARS.

21:47:28 SO IN THAT CASE, I THINK I FEEL 

21:47:30 COMFORTABLE SUPPORTING THE 

21:47:33 STAFF'S RECOMMENDATION FOR THE 

21:47:38 FOUR-LANE PROPOSAL, ESPECIALLY 

21:47:39 CONSIDERING THAT THAT PROPOSAL 

21:47:41 WINS THE SUPPORT OF THE LOCAL 

21:47:41 SMALL BUSINESS.

21:47:51 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU, NEXT 

21:47:54 FOR THE COMMENTS AT THIS POINT 

21:47:57 IS COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN.

21:47:58 >> Councilmember Kassan:   I 

21:47:59 THINK WE NEED TO ACKNOWLEDGE 

21:48:01 THAT WE HAVE NO DATA, NO 

21:48:02 REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLE OF PEOPLE 

21:48:04 WHO USE THE STREET.

21:48:06 THE LEAP FROM WHAT WE WERE TOLD 

21:48:09 ABOUT THE BUSINESSES TO SAYING, 

21:48:10 THE BUSINESSES DO NOT SUPPORT 

21:48:13 THREE LANES, ISN'T A LEAP THAT I 

21:48:14 DON'T SEE ANY JUSTIFICATION FOR 

21:48:14 MAKING.

21:48:16 WE WERE TOLD SOME BUSINESSES 

21:48:18 SUPPORTED IT, SOME BUSINESSES 

21:48:19 DIDN'T.

21:48:23 WHEN MS. KIMBERLIN CAME ON IF 

21:48:25 YOU LISTEN CAREFULLY TO WHAT SHE 

21:48:27 SAID, SHE SAID BUSINESSES 

21:48:28 SUPPORTED THIS BUT BECAUSE THE 

21:48:29 COMMUNITY IS AGAINST THE THREE 

21:48:31 LANES I GUESS WE NEED TO GO WITH 

21:48:32 FOUR.

21:48:34 SO COMING -- SAYING THAT OH WE 

21:48:35 HEARD FROM THE BUSINESSES THAT 

21:48:37 THEY DON'T WANT THIS, THAT IS 

21:48:38 NOT TRUE.

21:48:40 WE ALSO DIDN'T HEAR FROM A LOT 

21:48:41 OF OTHER MEMBERS OF THE 

21:48:43 COMMUNITY WHO HAPPENED TO NOT 

21:48:44 RESPOND TO THIS SURVEY.

21:48:45 LET'S JUST ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE 

21:48:47 HAVE NO DATA, WE HAVE NO TRAFFIC 

21:48:50 DATA THAT IS RELEVANT EXCEPT 

21:48:52 TRAFFIC DATA THAT SHOWS THAT 

21:48:55 GOING DOWN TO THREE LANES DIDN'T 

21:48:57 HAVE ANY NEGATIVE IMPACT AT ALL, 

21:48:58 THAT'S THE DATA AND WE HAVE NO 

21:49:00 CONCRETE DATA ON WHAT THE PEOPLE 

21:49:02 IN THE COMMUNITY ACTUALLY WANT.

21:49:04 AND WE HAVE TO RUSH.

21:49:08 WE CAN'T QUARTER THAT DATA 

21:49:10 BECAUSE WE ARE IN A RUSH NOW.

21:49:12 WE HAVE TO MAKE THIS DECISION 

21:49:14 BASED ON PRINCIPLES, RATHER THAN 

21:49:15 DATA, OTHER THAN THE FACT THAT 

21:49:18 THE THREE LANES DIDN'T HAVE ANY 

21:49:19 NEGATIVE EFFECT ON TRAFFIC.

21:49:21 WE HAVE TO BASE IT ON 

21:49:21 PRINCIPLES.

21:49:23 SO WHAT PRINCIPLES DO WE CLAIM 

21:49:25 TO SUPPORT AS A CITY COUNCIL?

21:49:27 WE CLAIM TO CARE ABOUT OUR SMALL 

21:49:27 BUSINESS DISTRICTS.

21:49:29 I HAVE A MASTER'S DEGREE IN CITY 

21:49:30 PLANNING.

21:49:31 I WORKED AS A MAIN STREET 

21:49:33 MANAGER IN A SMALL BUSINESS 

21:49:34 DISTRICT FOR MANY YEARS.

21:49:36 THERE'S SOME VERY BASIC 

21:49:37 PRINCIPLES.

21:49:39 IF YOU GO TO THE MAIN STREET 

21:49:41 PUBLICATIONS YOU'LL FIND THERE 

21:49:43 IS SOME BASIC PRINCIPLES OF WHAT 

21:49:47 MAKES A MAIN STREET SUCCESSFUL.

21:49:51 ONE LANE IN EACH DIRECTION, 

21:49:53 SIDEWALKS AT LEAST EIGHT FEET.

21:49:55 WE HAVE HISTORIC BUILDINGS 

21:49:55 THERE.

21:49:57 YES SOME NEW DEVELOPMENTS WILL 

21:49:58 COME IN BUT THE MAJORITY OF 

21:49:59 SIDEWALKS ARE GOING TO BE FIVE 

21:50:00 FEET.

21:50:02 THAT'S NOT ENOUGH FOR PEOPLE TO 

21:50:04 WALK NEXT TO EACH OTHER OR TO 

21:50:05 PASS EACH OTHER.

21:50:07 THAT IS NOT AN ACCEPTABLE 

21:50:09 SIDEWALK WIDTH FOR A STREET THAT 

21:50:11 WE WANT TO BE A HEALTHY 

21:50:12 PEDESTRIAN WALKABLE VIBRANT 

21:50:13 DISTRICT.

21:50:16 AND THEN FINALLY IT IS 

21:50:16 ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL THIS THERE 

21:50:18 BE PARKING IN FRONT OF ALL THE 

21:50:19 BUILDINGS, IN FRONT.

21:50:21 BECAUSE THERE'S BEEN MANY -- 

21:50:22 THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF DATA THAT 

21:50:24 SHOW THAT IF PEOPLE AREN'T USED 

21:50:26 TO COMING TO A SHOPPING STREET 

21:50:27 AND THEY'RE JUST STARTING TO GET 

21:50:29 COMFORTABLE WITH IT, THE THING 

21:50:30 THAT'S GOING TO MAKE THEM 

21:50:33 COMFORTABLE IS BEING ABLE TO 

21:50:34 PULL OVER AND PARK IN FRONT OF 

21:50:35 THE BUSINESS.

21:50:37 WE'RE GOING TO BE KILLING -- 

21:50:39 THAT STREET IS NOT DOING VERY 

21:50:40 WELL RIGHT NOW BUT WE HAVE THE 

21:50:42 OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE IT A MORE 

21:50:43 SUCCESSFUL STREET.

21:50:44 THERE'S NOTHING TO DO IN 

21:50:44 FREMONT.

21:50:46 THERE'S NO PLACE TO WALK AROUND 

21:50:48 UNLESS YOU LIKE WALKING AROUND A 

21:50:48 SHOPPING MALL.

21:50:51 THIS IS OUR CHANCE TO HAVE A 

21:50:52 HISTORIC COMMERCIAL DISTRICT 

21:50:54 THAT'S PEDESTRIAN FRIENDLY, 

21:50:56 WALKABLE, AND COULD ACTUALLY 

21:50:58 HAVE VIBRANT BUSINESSES.

21:51:00 WE HAVE TO BASE OUR DECISION ON 

21:51:01 THE PRINCIPLES OF WHAT MAKES A 

21:51:02 GOOD MAIN STREET.

21:51:05 AND THAT DOESN'T EVEN ADDRESS 

21:51:07 THE ISSUE OF CLIMATE CHANGE, THE 

21:51:10 ISSUE OF PEDESTRIAN SAFETY, IT'S 

21:51:12 AN ABSOLUTE FACT THAT FOUR LANES 

21:51:14 IS GOING TO RESULT IN MORE 

21:51:16 SERIOUS INJURIES AND FATALITIES.

21:51:18 FATALITIES HAVE BEEN GOING UP IN 

21:51:20 FREMONT FOR PEDESTRIANS, WE HAD 

21:51:22 OUR WORST YEAR LAST YEAR FOR 

21:51:24 PEDESTRIAN FATALITIES THAN WE'VE 

21:51:25 HAD IN MANY, MANY YEARS.

21:51:27 WE HAVE TO GET SERIOUS ABOUT 

21:51:27 THIS.

21:51:30 AND YES, THERE WILL BE OUTCRIES.

21:51:32 WE'VE MADE SOME MAJOR CHANGES ON 

21:51:34 OUR STREETS ALREADY LIKE WALNUT.

21:51:36 PEOPLE ARE VERY ANGRY ABOUT IT.

21:51:38 BUT GUESS WHAT?

21:51:40 THEY'RE SURVIVING.

21:51:41 THEY MIGHT BE DELAYED A FEW 

21:51:43 MINUTES IN DRIVING BUT WE'RE 

21:51:45 SAVING LIVES AND WE'RE DOING 

21:51:47 SOMETHING TO SAVE THE PLANET.

21:51:49 I MEAN WE NEED TO BE 

21:51:51 TRANSITIONING AWAY FROM EVERYONE 

21:51:52 THINKING THEY CAN JUMP IN THEIR 

21:51:54 CAR AND NOT HAVE ANY DELAYS AS 

21:51:56 THEY'RE GETTING TO THEIR 

21:51:57 LOCATION.

21:51:58 WE HAVE TO BASE THIS DECISION 

21:52:01 THOUGHT ON, YOU KNOW, OH WE KIND 

21:52:03 OF OF HEARD THAT MAYBE SOME 

21:52:05 BUSINESS OWNERS DON'T LIKE THIS 

21:52:07 OR OH 90% OF PEOPLE WHO HAPPEN 

21:52:09 TO RESPOND TO THIS SURVEY DIDN'T 

21:52:10 LIKE THIS.

21:52:12 WE HAVE TO BASE THE DECISION ON 

21:52:13 THE PRINCIPLES THAT WE CLAIM TO 

21:52:15 CARE ABOUT AND WE CLAIM TO CARE 

21:52:16 ABOUT SMALL BUSINESS.

21:52:18 WE CLAIM TO CARE ABOUT HAVING 

21:52:20 VIBRANT, WALKABLE COMMERCIAL 

21:52:22 DISTRICTS, HAVING STUFF TO DO, 

21:52:23 PLACES TO WALK AROUND, 

21:52:24 ENTERTAINMENT WHICH WE REALLY 

21:52:27 DON'T HAVE NOW ANYWHERE IN OUR 

21:52:29 CITY, WE CLAIM TO CARE ABOUT 

21:52:31 CLIMATE CHANGE, WE CLAIM TO CARE 

21:52:32 ABOUT PEDESTRIAN SAFETY AND IF 

21:52:34 THOSE ARE THE THINGS WE REALITY 

21:52:36 CARE ABOUT WE MUST GO TO THREE 

21:52:37 LANES.

21:52:38 THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO EVIDENCE 

21:52:40 THAT THIS HAS ANY NEGATIVE 

21:52:41 EFFECT ON TRAFFIC.

21:52:42 YES THERE MIGHT BE SOME DELAYS 

21:52:45  

21:52:46 FROM TIME TO TIME BUT THE DATA 

21:52:48 DO NOT SHOW ANY NEGATIVE EFFECT.

21:52:50 I'M BEGGING YOU PLEASE THIS IS A 

21:52:52 DECISION THAT WILL AFFECT OUR 

21:52:53 CITY FOR DECADES TO COME.

21:52:56 IF WE WANT TO HAVE A CHANCE, 

21:52:58 BEHIND ME IS A PICTURE OF 

21:53:00 DOWNTOWN MOUNTAIN VIEW, CASTRO 

21:53:02 STREET, ANY STREET THAT YOU -- 

21:53:03 WHAT STREETS DO YOU DRIVE TO?

21:53:05 LIKE YOU DRIVE 15 MINUTES, HALF 

21:53:08 AN HOUR TO GO THERE WALK AROUND.

21:53:09 NAME ME ONE OF THOSE STREETS 

21:53:12 THAT HAS TWO LANES IN EACH 

21:53:13 DIRECTION.

21:53:15 EVERY WALKABLE STREET, IF YOU GO 

21:53:17 TO EUROPE THEY ALL HAVE ONE LANE 

21:53:18 IN EACH DIRECTION.

21:53:21 WE HAVE TO NOT BE SO CONCERNED 

21:53:23 ABOUT DRIVERS COMPLAINING ABOUT 

21:53:25 BEING DELAYED FOR A FEW MINUTES.

21:53:27 THERE ARE MULTIPLE ALTERNATIVE 

21:53:29 WAYS FOR PEOPLE TO GET FROM 

21:53:31 POINT A TO POINT B.

21:53:32 IF THEY'RE DELAYED FOR A FEW 

21:53:33 MINUTES THAT'S NOT THE END OF 

21:53:34 THE WORLD.

21:53:36 THAT IS THE TRADEOFF THAT WE 

21:53:38 WANT TO ACCEPT IF WE WANT TO 

21:53:40 LIVE IN A PLANET THAT'S GOING TO 

21:53:43 SURVIVE AND WE HAVE PEDESTRIANS 

21:53:45 AND BUYS SCHITS THAT ARE GOING 

21:53:47 TO SURVIVE.

21:53:49 PLEASE FLEECE VOTE BASED ON 

21:53:52 FRINS AND NOT BASED ON ANECDOTES 

21:53:54 AND OH I HAVEN'T SEEN ANY 

21:53:56 PEDESTRIANS THERE.

21:53:58 THAT IS NOT A REASON TO MAKE A 

21:53:59 DECISION THAT'S GOING TO AFFECT 

21:54:01 US FOR DECADES TO COME.

21:54:09 THANK YOU.

21:54:10 >> Mayor Mei:   NEXT IS 

21:54:11 COUNCILMEMBER KENG.

21:54:13 WELCOME.

21:54:14 >> Councilmember Keng:   THANK 

21:54:15 YOU, MADAM MAYOR.

21:54:17 I APPRECIATE ALL THE WORK STAFF 

21:54:18 HAS DONE FOR LOCAL COMMUNITIES 

21:54:19 AND THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

21:54:21 I ALSO APPRECIATE COUNCILMEMBER 

21:54:23 JONES AND CENTERVILLE BUSINESS 

21:54:25 ASSOCIATION'S OUTREACH TO THE 

21:54:27 LOCAL BUSINESS OWNERS THERE.

21:54:30 AS A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER 

21:54:32 MYSELF, AND A PARENT OF A 

21:54:34 THORNTON JUNIOR HIGH STUDENT 

21:54:35 TRAVELING FROM NORTH FREMONT, I 

21:54:39 DO SUPPORT THIS FOUR LANE CHANGE 

21:54:41 DESIGN.

21:54:43 THIS SECTION OF FREMONT 

21:54:44 BOULEVARD IS NOT DESIGNED WITH 

21:54:45 THE SURROUNDING STREETS BEING 

21:54:48 ABLE TO TAKE THE TRAFFIC, TRYING 

21:54:49 TO GO AROUND IT.

21:54:52 SO IF WE REDUCE, WHEN WE REDUCE 

21:54:53 IT TO THREE LANE, ESPECIALLY 

21:54:55 WHEN PEOPLE ARE GETTING BACK TO 

21:54:57 WORK, GETTING BACK TO SCHOOL 

21:55:00 IT'S GOING TO CREATE HUGE 

21:55:02 TRAFFIC JAMS GOING BOTH WAYS.

21:55:05 SO I DO SUPPORT THE NEW 

21:55:09 FOUR-LANE DESIGN AS PROPOSED BY 

21:55:09 STAFF.

21:55:10 THANK YOU.

21:55:11 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

21:55:13 I SEE TWO OTHER HANDS STILL 

21:55:14 RAISED BUT I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S 

21:55:16 BEFORE, I JUST WANTED TO 

21:55:16 CLARIFY.

21:55:20 I SEE BOTH COUNCILMEMBER COX AND 

21:55:21 JONES STILL HANDS ARE UP.

21:55:26 OKAY.

21:55:27 >> Councilmember Jones:   I'M 

21:55:29 READY TO MAKE A MOTION WHEN 

21:55:30 YOU'RE THROUGH WITH YOUR 

21:55:30 COMMENTS.

21:55:31 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

21:55:33 SO I WANTED TO SHARE THAT I 

21:55:34 ABSOLUTELY BELIEVED IN TRYING TO 

21:55:36 LOOK AT SOME OF THE OPTIONS WITH 

21:55:38 THE ROAD DIET AND SINCE I 

21:55:40 ACTUALLY WAS SUPPORTING THE 

21:55:42 GRANT FOR THAT.

21:55:49 BUT I WILL TELL YOU THAT SINCE 

21:55:53 I'M A FREQUENT VISIT OR TO THAT 

21:55:55 STRIP AREA, LOOKING FOR PLACES 

21:56:01 TO EAT, PLACES TO SHOP PLACES TO 

21:56:03 WALK, PEOPLE HOPE IT'S STILL 

21:56:05 FOUR LANES INSTEAD OF THREE AND 

21:56:06 REDUCED LANES.

21:56:11 PEOPLE ARE DRIVING 

21:56:16  UNFORTUNATELY 

21:56:17 ERRATICALLY.

21:56:20 I KNOW THAT I'M ABSOLUTELY 

21:56:22 EXCITED AND HOPEFUL WITH FUTURE 

21:56:25 PROJECTS BECAUSE WE HAVE SO MANY 

21:56:25 BOTH DEVELOPMENTS AS WELL AS 

21:56:27 WITH TRANSPORTATION, THAT'S ONE 

21:56:28 OF THE THINGS THAT I HAD 

21:56:30 PROPOSED IS HAVING ONCE A YEAR 

21:56:31 MEETING WITH SOME OF OUR 

21:56:33 COMMISSIONS TO TALK ABOUT WHAT 

21:56:34 ARE SOME OF THE FOCUSES.

21:56:36 BUT CERTAINLY WE ENCOURAGE OUR 

21:56:37 COMMISSIONS CONSTANTLY TO HAVE 

21:56:39 THAT RELATIONSHIP ON THESE 

21:56:39 PROJECTS.

21:56:43 AND SINCE WE HAD THOSE 

21:56:45 NEIGHBORHOOD MEETINGS OR THOSE 

21:56:46 FOUR COMMUNITY MEETINGS, WE 

21:56:48 DEFINITELY WERE ENCOURAGING 

21:56:49 REPRESENTATION FROM ALL THOSE 

21:56:51 AREAS.

21:56:53 ONE OF THE THINGS I ALSO NOTE 

21:56:54 HAVING WALKED THAT AREA 

21:56:56 FREQUENTLY IS AC TRANSIT.

21:56:57 AND THAT IS ONE OF THE ROUTES 

21:57:00 THAT WE HAVE THEM GOING THROUGH.

21:57:01 IN TERMS OF ACCESS.

21:57:04 AND WHEN WE THINK ABOUT COMPLETE 

21:57:07 STREETS, WE THINK ABOUT THE 

21:57:08 CARS, WE THINK ABOUT 

21:57:09 PEDESTRIANS, WE THINK ABOUT 

21:57:10 BIKES.

21:57:12 BUT WE ALSO NEED TO THINK ABOUT 

21:57:13 PUBLIC TRANSIT AND THAT IS ONE 

21:57:14 OF THE STRUGGLES RIGHT NOW IN 

21:57:16 TERMS OF WHEN I SEE THAT GOING 

21:57:17 THROUGH THE CORRIDOR, THERE 

21:57:19 SEEMS TO BE SOME CHALLENGES AS 

21:57:21 TO PLACES FOR IT TO BE ABLE TO 

21:57:22 DROP OFF AND PICK UP.

21:57:25 AND THAT IS A STRUGGLE THAT 

21:57:27 WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO ADDRESS IN 

21:57:29 TERMS OF THE AREAS WHERE WE CAN 

21:57:31 TURN AROUND AND LOOK AT WHERE 

21:57:33 THEY CAN SAFELY PULL OFF.

21:57:36 I AM SUPPORTIVE OF THE STAFF 

21:57:37 RECOMMENDATION.

21:57:43 AND SO I WOULD SAY IT'S 

21:57:46 SOMETHING THAT WHEN WE LOOK AT 

21:57:47 IT WE HAVE TO EVALUATE ALL OF 

21:57:48 THE PIECES.

21:57:49 FOR THIS MOMENT WE NEED TO 

21:57:51 RETURN TO THE FOUR BUT I BELIEVE 

21:57:53 IN THE COMPLETE STREETS UPDATES 

21:57:54 THAT ARE ALSO HAPPENING.

21:57:56 I ALSO THINK JUST TO COMMENT I 

21:57:58 KNOW SOME QUESTIONS HAD COME UP 

21:57:59 ABOUT MINORITY BUSINESSES AND 

21:58:01 THE OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE TO 

21:58:02 BID.

21:58:04 THE ALAMEDA COUNTY OFFICE DOES 

21:58:06 HOLD ESPECIALLY THE ACTC 

21:58:08 TRANSPORTATION AND DOES DO 

21:58:09 OUTREACH SPECIFICALLY FOR ASKING 

21:58:12 PEOPLE TO JOIN FOR BIDDER 

21:58:13 AWARENESS PROJECTS.

21:58:16 AND ALSO TRYING TO SOLICIT MORE 

21:58:18 PARTICIPATION FROM MINORITIES 

21:58:20 AND WOMEN-OWNED BUSINESSES.

21:58:22 I'VE ATTENDED SOME OF THEM IN 

21:58:24 THE PAST AND THAT'S SOMETHING 

21:58:25 THAT I'M HAPPY TO SHARE AGAIN 

21:58:27 BUT I KNOW THAT OUR STAFF WORKS 

21:58:30 IN CONCERT WITH THE COUNTY, AND 

21:58:31 THE COUNTY TRANSPORTATION, AND 

21:58:34 THAT IS A QUESTION THAT DOES 

21:58:35 FREQUENTLY COME UP IN THE 

21:58:38 DISCUSSIONS WITH OUR BOARD OF 

21:58:42 SUPERVISORS ON THE COMMITTEE AS 

21:58:44 WELL AS ON THE -- FROM THE 

21:58:47 COMMUNITY FELLOW ELECTS, 

21:58:55  ELECTEDS, THAT 

21:58:59 BEING SAID, RICK, YOU HAD RAISED 

21:59:01 YOUR HAND TO MAKE A MOTION.

21:59:01 >> Councilmember Jones:   THANK 

21:59:02 YOU MAYOR.

21:59:04 SO I MOVE THAT WE APPROVE THE 

21:59:05 STAFF RECOMMENDATION IN 

21:59:06 RETURNING THE STREET TO FOUR 

21:59:08 LANES AND DOING THE IMPROVEMENTS 

21:59:10 THAT MR. LARSON HAS OUTLINED.

21:59:12 I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE A GREAT 

21:59:13 BENEFIT TO THAT PARTICULAR 

21:59:15 SECTION OF STREET AND TO OUR 

21:59:17 LOCAL BUSINESSES IN PARTICULAR.

21:59:22 THANK YOU.

21:59:23 >> Councilmember Kassan:   I WAS 

21:59:24 GOING TO COMMENT THAT WHEN 

21:59:26 PEDESTRIANS DIE AS THEY HAVE IN 

21:59:27 OUR CITY I HOPE YOU ALL REMEMBER 

21:59:29 THIS VOTE AND THE VOTE ON 

21:59:30 FAPPED.

21:59:30 THANK YOU.

21:59:32  PASEO 

21:59:33 PADRE.

21:59:34 THANK YOU.

21:59:35 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

21:59:37 >> Councilmember Shao:   I

21:59:40 >> Mayor Mei:   OKAY MOTION BY 

21:59:43 COUNCILMEMBER JONES AND SECONDED 

21:59:46 BY COUNCILMEMBER YANG SHAO.

21:59:50 >> The Clerk:   COUNCILMEMBER

21:59:57 >> The Clerk:   COUNCILMEMBER 

22:00:00 SHAO.

22:00:03 >> Councilmember Shao:   AYE.

22:00:04 >> The Clerk:   COUNCILMEMBER

22:00:20 >> Mayor Mei:   AYE.

22:00:23 THE MOTION PASSES WITH TWO NAYS, 

22:00:26 COUNCILMEMBER COX AND 

22:00:27 COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN AND VICE 

22:00:29 MAYOR SALWAN IS RECUSED.

22:00:30 SO THANK YOU.

22:00:38 NEXT WE WILL RETURN BACK TO 

22:00:39 PUBLIC COMMENTS AND I THINK WE 

22:00:40 HAVE SOME THAT HAVE NOT HAD A 

22:00:42 CHANCE TO SPEAK AND WE'LL RETURN 

22:00:44 TO THOSE.

22:00:46 COUNCILMEMBER HAND IS RAISED, IS 

22:00:55 THAT FROM BEFORE?

22:00:55 >> Councilmember Jones:   THERE 

22:00:56 YOU GO.

22:00:58 >> Mayor Mei:   OKAY, THANK YOU.

22:00:59 WE'LL RETURN TO PUBLIC COMMENTS 

22:01:01 FOR THOSE WHO HAVE NOT SPOKEN.

22:01:03 AGAIN WE'RE GOING BACK TO A 

22:01:03 MINUTE.

22:01:05 SO WE HAVE AGU.

22:01:15 >> HI, DEAR COUNCILMEMBERS, SO 

22:01:17 THIS IS ABOUT THE HOMEKEY 

22:01:17 PROJECT.

22:01:19 SO WHEN YOU MADE UP DECISIONS ON 

22:01:22 THE HOMEKEY PROJECT NONE OF YOU 

22:01:23 ACTUALLY LIVE IN THE WARM 

22:01:25 SPRINGS COMMUNITY.

22:01:28 YET AS WARM SPRINGS RESIDENT IT 

22:01:29 SIMPLY CANNOT SUPPORT THIS 

22:01:29 PROJECT.

22:01:32 IF OUR CONCERNS ARE NOT 

22:01:33 ADEQUATELY ADDRESSED.

22:01:34 ESPECIALLY THE SAFETY CONCERNS 

22:01:37 FOR OUR KIDS AND SENIORS.

22:01:40 SO IF YOU HAVE TO IMPLEMENT THIS 

22:01:42 PROJECT, WE WOULD DEFINITELY 

22:01:44 REQUIRE AT LEAST MORE POLICE 

22:01:45 FORCE IN OUR COMMUNITY.

22:01:48 AND THE POLICE HAVE TO BE ABLE 

22:01:50 TO IMMEDIATELY RESPOND TO PEOPLE 

22:01:51 CALLS.

22:01:53 IF YOU PROMISE THIS, IF YOU CAN, 

22:01:55 THEN PLEASE SHOW US SOME 

22:01:57 EVIDENCE ON HOW YOU WILL KEEP 

22:01:58 YOUR PROMISE.

22:02:01 FOR EXAMPLE, HOW WILL YOU 

22:02:03 ALLOCATE THE BUDGET FOR THESE 

22:02:03 NEEDS.

22:02:04 THANK YOU.

22:02:11 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

22:02:13 NEXT SPEAKER IS NS.

22:02:23 WELCOME.

22:02:25 >> HI, GOOD EVENING, CITY 

22:02:25 COUNCIL.

22:02:27 I'M A RESIDENT OF THE WARM 

22:02:28 SPRINGS AREA AND I JUST WANTED 

22:02:30 TO SAY THAT I AM STRONGLY IN 

22:02:32 SUPPORT OF PROJECT HOMEKEY.

22:02:33 FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO THANK THE 

22:02:35 CITY COUNCIL FOR MAKING THIS 

22:02:36 PROJECT HAPPEN.

22:02:38 WE CLEARLY HAVE AN ISSUE WITH 

22:02:40 UNHOUSED FOLKS IN THE BAY AREA 

22:02:44 AND USING STATE GRANTED FUNDS TO 

22:02:47 HOUSEHOLDS IS A NO BRAINER AND 

22:02:49 THE BEAR MINIMUM WE SHOULD BE 

22:02:51 DOING, FAR BELOW THE MINIMUM IN 

22:02:52 MY OPINION.

22:02:54 FOR SOMEONE WHO DEEMS WITH 

22:02:57 MENTAL ILLNESS MYSELF I OBJECT 

22:03:03 TO THE CHARACTERIZATION OF 

22:03:04 PEOPLE WITH MENTAL IMNESS ARE 

22:03:06 DANGEROUS.

22:03:07 I WANT US TO SAY THIS IS THE 

22:03:10 BEAR MINIMUM WE SHOULD BE DOING.

22:03:12 I'M AWARE THAT THERE ARE OTHER 

22:03:13 INITIATIVES THE CITY HAS BEEN 

22:03:15 RUNNING AND I THANK YOU FOR THAT 

22:03:17 BUT I WOULD ENCOURAGE US TO DO 

22:03:19 MORE IF WE CAN, THANK YOU.

22:03:20 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

22:03:26 NEXT IS FAY.

22:03:34 INTERIN YOUR FAQ FOR THE HOMEKEY 

22:03:36 PROJECT YOU MENTIONED THE 

22:03:37 HOMEKEY PROJECT IS SUCCESSFUL, 

22:03:39 YOU BUILT 6,000 UNITS IN 

22:03:40 CALIFORNIA.

22:03:41 HOW IS THAT MEASUREMENT FOR 

22:03:42 SUCCESS.

22:03:44 FOR RESIDENTS, SUCCESS MEANS 

22:03:46 THAT NO MORE HOMELESS FOLKS ARE 

22:03:48 CREATED BY THE BROKEN SYSTEM AND 

22:03:51 WE SEE CLEANER STREETS AND SAFER 

22:03:51 STREETS.

22:03:52 WILL YOU MAKE SURE THAT THIS 

22:03:55 PROJECT WILL BE SUCCESSFUL PER 

22:03:56 THE RESIDENTS DEFINITION?

22:03:57 BECAUSE THE GOAL IS FOR THESE 

22:03:59 PEOPLE TO HAVE THEIR OWN HOMES 

22:04:02 RATHER THAN LIVING IN MOTELS.

22:04:04 SUCCESS TO ME IS THAT THE 

22:04:06 ABLE-BODIED FOLKS CAN BE 

22:04:08 INDEPENDENT, THE DISABLED AND 

22:04:10 MENTALLY ILL CAN BE TAKEN CARE 

22:04:11 OF AT BETTER FACILITIES.

22:04:13 WE DON'T THINK THE PROGRAM IS 

22:04:16 SUCCESSFUL, IF WE END UP BEING 

22:04:18 LIKE SF, NEW YORK CITY.

22:04:20 PLEASE LOOK UP THE SURVEIL YOURS 

22:04:23 OF THOSE CITIES AND LEARN FROM 

22:04:25 THEIR MISTAKES AND NOT REPEAT 

22:04:25 IT.

22:04:27 AND AT THE END I JUST WANTED TO 

22:04:29 SAY WHOEVER PROVIDES SAFETY WILL 

22:04:32 GET OUR VOTES.

22:04:43 THANK YOU.

22:04:43 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

22:04:54 NEXT IS JAMES LEE.

22:04:55 >> JAMES, YOUD IN TO UNMUTE, 

22:05:02  YOU NEED TO UNMUTE, 

22:05:03 PLEASE.

22:05:05 >> Mayor Mei:   JAMESNESS.

22:05:08 JAMES.

22:05:10 >> HELLO, CAN YOU HEAR ME?

22:05:10 I'M BACK.

22:05:13 OKAY.

22:05:15 SO THANKS MAYOR AND ALSO THE 

22:05:17 COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR GIVING ME 

22:05:18 A CHANCE TO SPEAK FOR WARM 

22:05:19 SPRINGS RESIDENTS.

22:05:21 SO I THINK OUR BIG CONCERN ON 

22:05:24 THIS PROJECTS IS THAT BEFORE 

22:05:25 THIS PROJECT IS MOVING ON, 

22:05:27 THERE'S NO CLEAR COMMUNICATION 

22:05:29 TO ALL THE RESIDENTS OF THE WARM 

22:05:30 SPRINGS AREA.

22:05:34 AND THERE IS NO SURVEY, NO 

22:05:37 NOTIFICATION, AND EVEN NO 

22:05:39 CONCERN OF ANY OPINION OF US.

22:05:46 SO I DO APPRECIATE MANY OF YOU, 

22:05:49 WORKED IDEAS THE STREETS 

22:05:51 PROJECT, THINK ABOUT ALL THE 

22:05:51 COMMUNITY COMMERCIALS.

22:05:55 BUT IN TEMPS OF THIS HOMEKEY 

22:05:56 PROJECT NONE OF US WERE ASKED OF 

22:05:58 OUR OPINIONS.

22:06:01 AND NO CONCERN ON THE SAFETY OF 

22:06:03 ALL THE THOUSANDS OR TEN 

22:06:05 THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE IN OUR AREA.

22:06:07 SO THAT'S OUR BIGGEST CONCERN ON 

22:06:08 THIS PROJECT.

22:06:10 OKAY.

22:06:12 >> MADAM MAYOR WE STILL HAVE TWO 

22:06:13 PEOPLE AT THE TOP OF THE QUEUE 

22:06:16 THAT WERE -- HAD RAISED THEIR 

22:06:19 HANDS EARLIER REVEREND WANDA 

22:06:21 JOHNSON AND VALERIE KELLY.

22:06:23 THEIR HANDS ARE NOT CURRENTLY 

22:06:24 RAISED BUT WE HAD RECOGNIZED 

22:06:26 THEM THAT WE WOULD COME BACK TO 

22:06:27 THEM.

22:06:29 >> Mayor Mei:   OKAY, THANK YOU.

22:06:30 REVEREND WANDA JOHNSON, WELCOME.

22:06:35 >> THANK YOU SO MUCH.

22:06:41 I AM REALLY DISTURBED THAT MAYOR 

22:06:45   

22:06:47 LILY WOULD NOT LISTEN AND 

22:06:49 REJECTED THE BLACK HISTORY 

22:06:49 PROCLAMATION.

22:06:51 WHEN WE LOOK AT AMERICA WE MUST 

22:06:53 UNDERSTAND THAT ALL PEOPLE HAVE 

22:06:55 A RIGHT, AND SHOULD BE TREATED 

22:06:56 EQUALLY.

22:06:59 I'M THE MOTHER OF OS GRANT THAT 

22:07:00 WAS KILLED JANUARY 1st, 2009 

22:07:10 AT THE FRUITVALE BART STATION.

22:07:18 AND IT STILL CONCERNS ME WOULD 

22:07:24 NOT EVEN RESPOND TO 

22:07:25 COUNCILMEMBER COX, THIS IS 

22:07:26 UNACCEPTABLE.

22:07:29 AND IT SHOULD BE REVISITED AND 

22:07:30 IT SHOULD BE APPROVED.

22:07:31 THANK YOU.

22:07:42 >> Mayor Mei:   VALERIE KELLY.

22:07:51 VALERIE KELLY, PLEASE UNMUTE IF 

22:07:54 YOU ARE STILL WANTING TO SPEAK 

22:07:54 UNDER ORAL COMMUNICATIONS.

22:08:11 >> OKAY, WE'LL MOVE ON TO ROLAND 

22:08:11 LAM.

22:08:15 >> I THANK YOU.

22:08:18 GOOD EVENING COUNCILMEMBERS.

22:08:20 I'M RESIDENCE IN WARM SPRINGS 

22:08:21 FOR MORE THAN TEN YEARS.

22:08:23 I HAD A LOT OF QUESTIONS, 

22:08:27 COMMENTS ON THIS HOMEKEY MOTEL 

22:08:30 PROJECT, BAD JOB IN TERMS OF 

22:08:33 OUTREACHING THE COMMUNITY.

22:08:35 TO BE HONEST, PRETTY BAD, SORRY 

22:08:38 IF I OFFEND YOU GUYS.

22:08:42 COMPARED TO THE AGENDA OF 

22:08:45 TALKING ABOUT CENTERVILLE 

22:08:46 COMPLETE STREET, YOU GUYS DO A 

22:08:50 GOOD JOB, GETTING INPUT FROM THE 

22:08:50 COMMUNITY.

22:08:52 BY LOOKING AT THIS PROJECT, YOU 

22:08:54 KNOW, YOU HAVE MORE THAN SIX 

22:08:58 MONTHS TO INFORM PEOPLE, IMPOSE 

22:09:00 SOMETHING ON THE NOTIFICATION ON 

22:09:02 THE NEXT DOOR.

22:09:03 A FEW DAYS AGO BEFORE THE 

22:09:05 COUNCIL MEETING.

22:09:08 SO I DON'T THINK IT'S AN IDEA, 

22:09:09 BETTER THAN THAT.

22:09:12 SO WE PEOPLE HAVE A RIGHT TO 

22:09:16 INFORM FOR THE PROJECT.

22:09:19 BUT THEN YOU ARE THE PEOPLE 

22:09:23  

22:09:24 INNOCENT PEOPLE --

22:09:29 >> THANK YOU.

22:09:34 IS VALERIE ON YET, VALERIE 

22:09:34 KELLY?

22:09:36 OKAY WE'LL MOVE ON TO JERRY.

22:09:43 >> HI, YES, COUNCIL, I'M 

22:09:46 RESIDENT IN THE AREA, I OPPOSE 

22:09:50 THESE HOMEKEY PROJECT POSED IN 

22:09:54 THE AREA, OUTCOME OF THE 

22:09:55 PROJECT, IF IT WAS DONE, YOU 

22:09:57 SHOULD KNOW THAT THE MOTEL 

22:10:02 CONVERSION PROGRAM FAILED 

22:10:04 MISERABLY IN SAN FRANCISCO AND 

22:10:05 NEW YORK CITY.

22:10:07 IN NEW YORK CITY THE PROJECT HAS 

22:10:10 CAUSED MORE CRIME DRASTIC 

22:10:18 INCREASE IN 911 CALLS, SEX ACT 

22:10:20 ON THE STREET.

22:10:22 DECIDE TO END THIS PROGRAM.

22:10:25 IF THE CITY CONFIDENT THAT SUCH 

22:10:27 PAYOFF AND CRIMES WILL NOT 

22:10:28 HAPPEN AFTER THIS PROJECT IS 

22:10:29 IMPLEMENTED?

22:10:32 IS THE CITY GOING TO HAVE ENOUGH 

22:10:34 RESOURCE TO HANDLE ALL THESE 

22:10:36 ISSUES AND GUARANTEE THIS 

22:10:38 PROJECT WILL DO NO HARM TO THE 

22:10:39 RESIDENTS AND BUSINESS IN THE 

22:10:40 CITY?

22:10:42 FLEECE LET US KNOW IF YOU HAVE 

22:10:45 PLANS TO HANDLE ALL THIS IN THE 

22:10:46 CITY.

22:10:46 >> THANK YOU.

22:10:48 NEXT SPEAKER IS CLAIRE.

22:10:55 >> HELLO, SO THIS IS ALSO A WARM 

22:10:56 SPRINGS RESIDENT.

22:11:00 I'D LIKE TO EXPRESS MY STRONGLY 

22:11:01 OPPOSED TO THIS PROJECT.

22:11:03 THE HOMEKEY PROJECTS.

22:11:05 THERE ARE THREE REASONS, FIRST 

22:11:10 BEFORE THIS DECISION IS MADE, 

22:11:14 NOW OUR VOICE IS THOUGHT HEARD 

22:11:15 AND ONLINE WE HAVE A PETITION 

22:11:18 THAT THERE ARE OVER 2,000 PEOPLE 

22:11:20 ARE AGAINST THIS HOMEKEY 

22:11:22 PROJECT, AND THERE ARE MORE 

22:11:24 PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT KNOW ABOUT 

22:11:27 THIS PROJECT.

22:11:32 SO AND ALSO, CITIES LIKE THIS 

22:11:33 HOTEL BECAUSE OF THE CONVENIENCE 

22:11:35 FOR HOMELESS PEOPLE BUT ALSO 

22:11:36 THINK ABOUT THE KEYS.

22:11:39 THERE ARE A LOT OF ELEMENTARY 

22:11:41 DAY CARES AROUND THIS AREA.

22:11:44 MAYBE THE CITY LOCATION THEY 

22:11:46 CHOOSE IS THE LOCATION IS TOO 

22:11:48 CLOSE TO SCHOOLS AND DAYCARE SO 

22:11:52 FOR THE SAFETY OF THE SENIORITY 

22:11:54 AND THE KIDS.

22:11:55 >> THANK YOU.

22:11:57 MIN.

22:12:03 >> THANK YOU FOR OPPORTUNITY.

22:12:04 I HAVE THREE THINGS I WANT TO 

22:12:05 SHARE.

22:12:07 FIRST THING IS I LIVE IN THE 

22:12:10 DISTRICT 6 WHICH IS UNDER TERESA 

22:12:10 COX.

22:12:12 I REALLY APPRECIATE FOR YOUR 

22:12:14 WORK BUT I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT 

22:12:16 I HOPE YOU KEEP YOUR 

22:12:17 PROFESSIONAL AND RESPECTFUL FOR 

22:12:18 MEETING AGENDA.

22:12:22 AND ALSO, RESPECT YOUR COLLEAGUE 

22:12:24 FOR THIS EARLY INCIDENT.

22:12:29 AND SECONDLY, IS I REALLY WANT 

22:12:31 TO HONOR LILY MEI, YOU ARE 

22:12:36 WORKING SO HARD TO REPRESENT 

22:12:38 FREMONT, WE REALLY APPRECIATE 

22:12:40 FOR YOUR HARDWORKING.

22:12:42 AND THIRD THING IS WE ARE REALLY 

22:12:44 AGAINST THE HOMELESS PROJECT 

22:12:47 BECAUSE THE ENTIRE CALIFORNIA IS 

22:12:49 FAILING FOR THE HOMELESS PROJECT 

22:12:52 SO FAR HAVE NOT SEEN A GOOD 

22:12:53 HOMELESS PROJECT SUCCESSFUL IN 

22:12:54 CALIFORNIA.

22:12:56 SO WE DEFINITELY, WE DON'T WANT 

22:12:57 THIS IN FREMONT.

22:12:58 THANK YOU.

22:13:10 >> NEXT SPEAKER IS SAMEEN MURZA.

22:13:10 >> HELLO COUNCILMEMBERS.

22:13:12 I ALONG WITH ALL OF MY NEIGHBORS 

22:13:16 ARE STRONGLY OPPOSED TO THE 

22:13:18 HOMEKEY PROMPT.

22:13:20 WE RECOGNIZE THERE NEEDS TO BE A 

22:13:21 SET OF SOLUTIONS, AT THE SAME 

22:13:24 TIME WE EXPECT DUE DILIGENCE AND 

22:13:25 MORE OPTIONS TO ADDRESS THE 

22:13:26 ISSUE.

22:13:28 WHAT OFFENSE HE ARE IN THE LONG 

22:13:29 TERM?

22:13:31 NONE OF THIS IS SHARED WITH THE 

22:13:35 FAMILIES, THIS DECISION WILL 

22:13:36 IMPACT MOST GREATLY.

22:13:38 ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF HOW FREMONT 

22:13:40 BECOMES LESS AND LESS 

22:13:41 REPRESENTATIVE OF THE 

22:13:44 HARDWORKING CITIZENS THE CITY 

22:13:48 COUNCIL IS SUPPOSED TO SERVE.

22:13:50 RESPECTFUL OF ITS CONSTITUENTS 

22:13:52 IN FREMONT WE SEE INCREASE IN 

22:13:54 DRUG RELATED CRAIM, VANDALISM 

22:13:57 AND NORTHWEST WORSE IN OUR 

22:13:58 NEIGHBORHOOD.

22:14:00 STOP THIS HOMEKEY PROJECT NOW 

22:14:02 UNTIL YOU HAVE HEARD OUR VOICES.

22:14:03 THANK YOU.

22:14:10 >> KATHERINE MARUBY.

22:14:10 DWR HI.

22:14:14 >> HI.

22:14:17 I WANTED TO START OUT BY SAYING 

22:14:19 THIS MATTER WAS ALREADY 

22:14:22 ADDRESSED AND VOTED ON, I'M 

22:14:23 SORRY THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO 

22:14:25 ARE NOT STAYING ON TOP OF CITY 

22:14:27 COUNCIL AGENDA ITEMS BUT THIS 

22:14:28 SHOULD NOT BE A REASON TO 

22:14:31 REVISIT THIS TOPIC UNLESS NEW 

22:14:34 ASPECTS OF THIS PROJECT BECOME 

22:14:36  

22:14:37 APPARENT.

22:14:39 I'M CONCERNED THESE OBJECTORS 

22:14:41 USED AT LEAST PARTIAL 

22:14:43 MISINFORMATION TO GENERATE A 

22:14:45 PETITION BASED ON MYTHS AND 

22:14:47 STEREOTYPES TO UNFAIRLY SWAY 

22:14:49 PUBLIC OPINION AGAINST MANY 

22:14:51 ALREADY MALIGNED INDIVIDUALS WHO 

22:14:54 ARE UNHOUSED AND WHO COULD 

22:14:56 GREATLY BENEFIT FROM THIS 

22:14:56 PROJECT.

22:14:59 IN ADDITION THE ENTIRE CITIZENRY 

22:15:02 OF FREMONT STANDS TO BENEFIT 

22:15:07 FROM THIS PROJECT SO THESE MYTHS 

22:15:08 MAKE NO SENSE.

22:15:10 THESE FEARS AROUND THE HOMELESS 

22:15:12 ARE NOT NECESSARILY BASED IN 

22:15:14 FACT.

22:15:14 >> THANK YOU.

22:15:21 SYMON.

22:15:26 >> YES, THANKS, MAYOR AND 

22:15:28 COUNCILMEMBERS FOR THE HOMEKEY 

22:15:28 PROJECT.

22:15:31 I AGREE, WE SHOULD DO MORE AND 

22:15:33 DO IT RIGHT, IN HELPING HOMELESS 

22:15:34 PEOPLE.

22:15:38 AND AT THE SAME TIME, HOPEFUL 

22:15:41 CITY COUNCIL HEAR MORE ABOUT THE 

22:15:46 WARM SPRINGS AREA, RESIDENTS, 

22:15:47 THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF WARM 

22:15:50 SPRINGS RESIDENTS WHO INCLUDE 

22:15:55 ME, I DISAGREE, WITH CONVERTED 

22:15:57 MOTEL 6 IN WARM SPRINGS TO BE A 

22:15:59 HOMELESS HOUSING FACILITY.

22:16:05 WE THINK WE CITY COUNCIL SHOULD 

22:16:07 HEAR US MORE AND FIND A BETTER 

22:16:11 WAY TO AVOID THIS TYPE OF SIMPLE 

22:16:14 SOLUTION, JUST SIMPLY CONVERT TO 

22:16:17 MOTEL TO BE A HOMELESS FACILITY.

22:16:19 THAT WILL NOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM.

22:16:23 ALSO, WE --

22:16:26 >> THANK YOU.

22:16:31 HAI SHARE.

22:16:33 >> GOOD EVENING, MEMBERS OF CITY 

22:16:34 COUNCIL.

22:16:38 I'M HAYES SHARE, I'M SPEAKING TO 

22:16:40 CONVERT THE MOTEL 6 IN WARM 

22:16:41 SPRINGS.

22:16:43 I'M ALSO A MEMBER OF FREMONT FOR 

22:16:44 EVERYONE, A LOCAL GROUP 

22:16:46 ADVOCATING FOR EQUITABLE HOUSING 

22:16:48 ON BEHALF OF THE UNDERSERVED.

22:16:50 IT IS OUR BELIEF THAT THE ONLY 

22:16:52 SOLUTION TO HOMELESSNESS IS TO 

22:16:54 PROVIDE MORE PERMANENT HOUSING.

22:16:55 WE BELIEVE IN HOUSING FIRST, YOU 

22:16:59 HAVE TO HOUSE SOMEONE AS A 

22:17:04 PREREQUISITE, HOMEKEY PROPOSAL 

22:17:06 ACCOMPLISHMENTS THIS CRITICAL 

22:17:08 STEP AND ALLOWS HOMELESS FOLKS 

22:17:10 AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO GET OFF THE 

22:17:10 STREETS.

22:17:12 AS A HOMEOWNER AND A FATHER I 

22:17:14 BELIEVE PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE 

22:17:16 HOUSING WILL SAVE ON OUR PUBLIC 

22:17:18 HEALTH COSTS AND INCREASE OUR 

22:17:19 COLLECTIVE PROPERTY VALUES.

22:17:21 WE LOOK FORWARD TO PARTICIPATING 

22:17:24 IN THE OUTREACH, DISCUSSION AND 

22:17:24 EDUCATION OF THE PUBLIC IN THE 

22:17:25 WEEKS TO COME, THANK YOU FOR 

22:17:26 JURY SERVICE.

22:17:32 THANK YOU, CLEMENT.

22:17:39 >> HI, THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME 

22:17:41 TO SPEAK, MADAM MAYOR AND 

22:17:43 EVERYONE IN THE COUNCIL.

22:17:45 I'M NOT COMPLETELY OPPOSING THE 

22:17:47 HOMEKEY PROJECT.

22:17:48 I ACTUALLY WANTED TO HELP THE 

22:17:50 HOMELESS BUT I NEED A LONG TERM 

22:17:51 SOLUTION.

22:17:53 THERE WERE THREE MANAGERS 

22:17:57 SUPPOSED TO BE ONSITE ON THE 

22:17:59 HOTEL 6 TO MONITOR THE WHOLE 

22:18:00 SITUATION AND PROVIDE A SERVICE.

22:18:02 I WANT MORE DETAILS ON THOSE, 

22:18:04 OKAY?

22:18:07 AND I'M MORE CONCERNED ABOUT THE 

22:18:08 SAFETY OF THE ENVIRONMENT.

22:18:10 FOR EXAMPLE, INCREASE THE BART 

22:18:13 SUBSTATION AT THE -- SORRY, THE 

22:18:15 POLICE SUBSTATION AT THE WARM 

22:18:17 SPRINGS BART STATION TO MITIGATE 

22:18:19 ADDITIONAL CRIME.

22:18:19 OKAY?

22:18:21 AND THEN PROVIDE LONG TERM 

22:18:24 SOLUTIONS SUCH AS REHAB FOR DRUG 

22:18:27  

22:18:29 ADDICTS AND THEN PROVIDE MENTAL 

22:18:30 HEALTH SERVICES FOR THOSE WHO 

22:18:31 ARE NEEDED.

22:18:34 AND I DON'T LIKE THE IDEA OF 

22:18:35 MIXING EVERYONE TOGETHER IN ONE 

22:18:36 COMPLEX.

22:18:42 IT JUST DOESN'T REALLY WORK AND 

22:18:44 PROVEN WITH OTHER --

22:18:45 >> THANK YOU, ANNIE.

22:18:48 >> YES, I SUPPORT PROJECT AND I 

22:18:50 THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO 

22:18:52 NOTE THAT IT IS NOT A SHELTER.

22:18:53 IT IS PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE 

22:18:55 HOUSING THAT GETS PEOPLE OFF THE 

22:18:56 STREETS PERMANENTLY.

22:18:57 I QUITE FRANKARY DON'T WANT TO 

22:19:00 SEE UNHOUSED PEOPLE IN MY 

22:19:02 NEIGHBORHOOD EITHER BUT I 

22:19:03 RECOGNIZE THE SOLUTION THERE IS 

22:19:04 HOUSING.

22:19:06 I WAS INCREDIBLY HAPPY THAT 

22:19:13 COUNCIL VOTED UNANIMOUSLY TO 

22:19:19 PROJECT FUNDING FOR THIS 

22:19:20 PROJECT.

22:19:21 ISN'T BASED IN FACT, IN THE 

22:19:23 SPIRIT OF FACTS MATTERING I ALSO 

22:19:24 WANTED TO SHARE INFORMATION THAT 

22:19:26 I E-MAILED TO ALL THE 

22:19:27 COUNCILMEMBERS AND THE CITY 

22:19:28 CLERK.

22:19:31 FIRST, A STUDY IN THE LANCET IN 

22:19:35 2020 PROVES THAT PERMANENT 

22:19:38 SUPPORTIVE HOUSING IS EFFECTIVE 

22:19:39 IN KEEPING PEOPLE HOUSED AND A 

22:19:42 STUDY IN 2021 SHOWS THAT 

22:19:43 PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING 

22:19:46 REDUCES CRIME, PERSON COMMITS A 

22:19:50 CRIME BY 80% AND REDUCES THE 

22:19:53 DAYS THAT PEOPLE SPEND IN JAIL 

22:19:55 BY 130%.

22:19:59 >> THANK YOU, VENETA VERMA.

22:20:00 >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

22:20:02 LET ME SAY I SYMPATHIZE WITH 

22:20:05 PEOPLE WHO OPPOSE PROJECT 

22:20:07 HOMEKEY HOWEVER YOU CANNOT 

22:20:10 COMPARE FREMONT WITH NEW YORK.

22:20:13 FREMONT'S POPULATION IS 2900 PER 

22:20:15 SQUARE MILE.

22:20:17 BUT NEW YORK'S POPULATION IS 

22:20:19 27,000 PER SQUARE MILE BUT DOES 

22:20:23 NOT MAKE THOSE TWO CITIES 

22:20:25 EQUIVALENT.

22:20:26 MY QUESTION FOR THEM IS WHAT IS 

22:20:28 GOOD SOLUTION ACCORDING TO YOU?

22:20:30 PEOPLE SAY THAT HOMELESS DO NOT 

22:20:32 BELONG IN YOUR COMMUNITY.

22:20:35 WHERE ARE THEY SUPPOSED TO GO?

22:20:37 WHERE IN THE BAY AREA OR IN 

22:20:39 FREMONT DO YOU SEE WHERE PEOPLE 

22:20:40 ARE NOT THERE?

22:20:42 WHERE THEY CAN -- THE HOMELESS 

22:20:47 CAN BE HOUSED?

22:20:49 HOMELESS ARE NOT ALIENS AND THEY 

22:20:53 DO NOT HAVE THREE OR FOUR HEADS.

22:20:55 I HAVE HOMELESS SHELTER 500 

22:20:57 YARDS FROM MY HOUSE AND THEY 

22:20:59 HAVE NEVER BEEN A MESS FOR US.

22:21:00 IF YOU REALLY CARE ABOUT OUR 

22:21:03 NEIGHBORHOOD NEIGHBORS WE ARE 

22:21:06 WILLING TO PREACH, PLEASE SHARE.

22:21:08 >> THANK YOU.

22:21:09 SHAMSA.

22:21:14 >> I'D LIKE TO THANK MAYOR LILY 

22:21:17 MEI FOR THE PROCLAMATION FOR THE 

22:21:18 BLACK HISTORY MONTH.

22:21:18 THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH.

22:21:31 THANK YOU SO MUCH.

22:21:40 >> NEXT SPEAKER'S JESS.

22:21:47 >> HI, I STRONGLY OPPOSE, LIVING 

22:21:48 IN WARM SPRINGS AREA FOR 20 

22:21:50 YEARS, I ALSO HAVE TWO YOUNG 

22:21:52 KIDS AND I HAVE A HIGH TECH JOB 

22:21:58 AND I PAY MONEY EVERY YEAR HUGE 

22:21:59 BIG.

22:22:00 YOU HAVE HEARD A LOT OF 

22:22:02 RESIDENTS CALLING IN FROM WARM 

22:22:03 SPRINGS AREA AND I THINK OUR 

22:22:06 VOICES SHOULD BE HEARD AND OUR 

22:22:07 FEELINGS SHOULD BE VALUED 

22:22:09 BECAUSE WE ARE AFFECTED BY THIS 

22:22:10 PROJECT THE MOST.

22:22:12 IT IS A SHAME TO IGNORE THE 

22:22:14 VOICE FROM THE MAJORITY OF THE 

22:22:15 RESIDENTS ACTUALLY LIVING HERE 

22:22:17 FOR THE PEOPLE THAT CLAIM FOR 

22:22:19 BENEFIT OF GREATER POPULATION OR 

22:22:22 WHATSOEVER, OKAY, IS THERE 

22:22:23 EVIDENCE THAT THEY ACTUALLY LIVE 

22:22:24 IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD?

22:22:28 AND I WONDER HOW LONG, HOW THIS 

22:22:30 SURVEY WAS CONDUCTED AND IT'S 

22:22:31 SLOWLY BEFORE THE DECISION 

22:22:32 MAKING.

22:22:36 SO I APPRECIATE THE MAYOR AND 

22:22:38 ALSO COUNCIL TO EVALUATE THIS 

22:22:40 PROJECT ONCE AGAIN, THANK YOU.

22:22:41 >> THANK YOU.

22:22:46 NEXT SPEAKER IS PING.

22:22:48 >> HOLE, EVERYONE MY NAME IS 

22:22:50 PING, LONG TIME FREMONT RESIDENT 

22:22:52 AND A VERY BUSY MOM WITH TWO 

22:22:53 KIDS.

22:22:55 I'M HERE TONIGHT TO EXPRESS MY 

22:22:58 CONCERNS ON THE HOMEKEY PROJECT.

22:23:00 AS WE KNOW THERE ARE SO MANY 

22:23:02 SCHOOLS RESIDENCES AROUND THE 

22:23:04 HOMEKEY PROJECT AREA.

22:23:06 THERE ARE A LOT OF SENIORS THERE 

22:23:07 TOO.

22:23:09 WE ARE ALREADY SURE THE POLICE 

22:23:11 FOR FOR OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.

22:23:13 I'M JUST WONDERING HOW MUCH 

22:23:16 STUDY HAS THE FREMONT COUNTY 

22:23:18 DONE, THE PROJECTS IN NEW YORK 

22:23:19 AND SAN FRANCISCO DIDN'T GO WELL 

22:23:20 WHICH CAUSED THE CRIME RATE TO 

22:23:22 INCREASE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

22:23:24 HOW ACCOUNT CITY OF FREMONT 

22:23:26 JUSTIFY THE FEASIBILITY OF THE 

22:23:27 HOMEKEY PROJECTS HERE?

22:23:29 SINCE WE ALL WANT FREMONT TO BE 

22:23:31 A BETTER PLACE TO LIVE.

22:23:34 THIS IS NOT A CLAIM, RIGHT?

22:23:36 WE NEED PRACTICAL PLANS FROM THE 

22:23:37 CITY OF FREMONT BECAUSE THIS 

22:23:39 PROJECT WILL IMPACT EVERYBODY IN 

22:23:39 FREMONT.

22:23:41 AGAIN SAFETY IS A BIG ISSUE.

22:23:42 PLEASE VOTE AGAINST IT, THANK 

22:23:43 YOU.

22:23:44 >> THANK YOU.

22:23:46 NEXT SPEAKER IS ALI.

22:23:53 >> HELLO, YES, FIRST OF ALL I 

22:23:56 WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT 

22:23:57 COUNCILMEMBER COX SHOULD BE MORE 

22:23:59 RESPECTFUL FOR THE MEETING 

22:24:01 AGENDA AND EVERYONE THAT'S IN 

22:24:04 THE MEETING AS CLEARLY THE ISSUE 

22:24:06 THAT SHE'S DISCUSSED NEEDS TO BE 

22:24:07 TAKEN OFF LINE BETWEEN THE MAYOR 

22:24:08 AND THE COUNCILMEMBERS.

22:24:10 AND SECONDLY, I LIKE TO TALK 

22:24:14 ABOUT THE HOMEKEY PROJECT AND 

22:24:17 I'M AGAINST IT PERSONALLY, AND 

22:24:20 APPARENTLY, IF THERE'S 2,000 

22:24:21 SIGNATURES IN THE PETITION, AND 

22:24:24 AFTER IT'S BEEN APPROVED, THERE 

22:24:27 SHOULD BE A REVISIT TO THE 

22:24:27 ISSUE.

22:24:28 INSTEAD OF SAYING THAT OKAY YEAH 

22:24:30 WE DISCUSSED IT, SORRY, YOU GUYS 

22:24:32 DON'T KNOW ABOUT IT, WHOOPS, 

22:24:33 THAT'S IT.

22:24:37 SO THEREFORE I REALLY THINK THIS 

22:24:39 NEEDS TO BE -- THIS NEEDS TO BE 

22:24:42 REVISITED AND THERE SHOULD BE 

22:24:43 ANOTHER AGENDA ON WITH THE 

22:24:45 MEETING AND THE FUTURE MEETING 

22:24:47 AND THAT INCLUDES ALL 

22:24:49 INFORMATION SHARED TO ALL THE 

22:24:50 RESIDENTS.

22:24:56 THANK YOU.

22:24:58 >> MAYOR, THAT'S YOUR LAST 

22:24:58 SPEAKER.

22:25:00 YOU CAN CLOSE THE PUBLIC 

22:25:02 COMMUNICATION SECTION.

22:25:02 >> Mayor Mei:   AT THIS TIME I'M 

22:25:05 GOING TO KILO THE PUBLIC 

22:25:08 COMMUNICATIONS, I WANTED THE 

22:25:11 PUBLIC TO KNOW, THAT IF AN ITEM 

22:25:13 IS NOT AGENDIZED LIKE HOMEKEY, 

22:25:15 WE CAN TAKE IN YOUR COMMENTS BUT 

22:25:17 NOT SOMETHING WE CAN ADDRESS 

22:25:18 DIRECTLY IN RESPONSE TO YOU.

22:25:21 BUT WE HAVE ADDRESSED THOSE WITH 

22:25:22 FAQS.

22:25:25 I WOULD LIKE TO CLARIFY, IF YOU 

22:25:27 LOOK AT THE FAQS THIS IS FOR THE 

22:25:28 SUBMISSION FOR THE FUNDING.

22:25:30 AND IF THE FUNDING IS APPROVED 

22:25:32 IN MARCH WE WILL DEFINITELY 

22:25:33 PROCEED WITH DISCUSSIONS ON THE 

22:25:34 PROJECT.

22:25:36 BUT RIGHT NOW THIS IS FOR THE 

22:25:37 APPLICATION FOR THE FUNDING.

22:25:39 AND IF THERE IS NO FUNDING 

22:25:42 AWARDED TO US, THEN WE WOULD NOT 

22:25:43 HAVE BEEN PROCEEDING WITH THE 

22:25:44 PROJECT.

22:25:46 I ALSO WANTED TO NOTE JUST FOR 

22:25:49 FUTURE REFERENCE FOR AGENDA 

22:25:50 ITEMS PLEASE DO FOLLOW OUR CITY 

22:25:52 COUNCIL WEBSITE AS THERE ARE 

22:25:53 ALWAYS UPCOMING AGENDA ITEMS

22:27:41 CLARIFY.

22:27:42 >> Karena Shackelford:   THE 

22:27:44 VOTE THAT WAS TAKEN PREVIOUSLY 

22:27:47 ALLOWS THE PROJECT TO MOVE

22:27:54 THE COMMUNITY OUTREACH.

22:28:32 AND RIGHT NOW WITH SOME OF THE 

22:28:33 CHANGES THAT WERE IMPLEMENTED 

22:28:36 THIS PAST YEAR, FOR LAND USE, A 

22:28:41 LOT OF THOSE LAWS 

22:28:43 IMPLEMENTATIONS ARE GOING TO 

22:28:44 BE --

22:28:44 >> Councilmember Cox:   WE 

22:28:46 SHOULDN'T BE TALKING ABOUT THIS.

22:28:48 THIS IS NOT ON THE AGENDA.

22:28:50 >> Mayor Mei:   I WANTED THE 

22:28:51 COMMUNITY TO KNOW.

22:28:51 >> Councilmember Cox:   THIS IS 

22:28:52 NOT OFTEN THE AGENDA.

22:28:55 RULES.

22:28:56 >> Mayor Mei:   WELL I CAN 

22:28:58 COMMENT ON THE FACT THAT I WAS 

22:29:01 INVOLVED THEN WITH -- WE DO OUR 

22:29:02 NEXT AGENDA ITEM WHICH IS ABOUT 

22:29:03 UPDATES ON COMMISSIONS THAT YOU 

22:29:04 SERVE ON.

22:29:07 AND SO I WILL GIVE AN UPDATE ON 

22:29:09 SOME OF THE COMMISSIONS THAT I 

22:29:10 SERVE ON WHICH INCLUDE HOUSING 

22:29:13 AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT.

22:29:15 AND AS WELL AS ONES THAT ARE 

22:29:16 REPRESENTING THE CITY.

22:29:19 AND ONE EVER THOSE WOULD ALSO 

22:29:22 BE, I SIT ON U.S. CONFERENCE OF 

22:29:23 MAYORS, HOUSING DISCUSSION AND 

22:29:24 SO THAT IS ONE OF THE THINGS 

22:29:26 THAT WE DID UPDATE ON AS WELL AS 

22:29:27 LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES 

22:29:29 WHERE I SIT ON HOUSING, ECONOMIC 

22:29:30 DEVELOPMENT.

22:29:32 AND SO DURING THESE DISCUSSIONS, 

22:29:34 WE HAVE COVERED THE CHANGES THAT 

22:29:36 ARE BEING MADE CURRENTLY ON 

22:29:38 STATE LAWS THAT IMPLEMENT 

22:29:40 HOUSING DEVELOPMENT.

22:29:42 THE OTHER THING I ALSO WOULD 

22:29:43 UPDATE AND SHARE WITH THE 

22:29:47 COMMUNITY IS THAT I SIT ON SAN 

22:29:49 JOAQUIN REGIONAL RAIL COMMISSION 

22:29:52 WHICH FOCUSED ON RECENTLY 

22:29:54 UPDATING ACCESS FOR TRANSIT.

22:29:56 AND WE TALK ABOUT ADOPTION OF 

22:29:58 PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION AND THAT 

22:29:59 INCLUDES ADOPTION OF WiFi 

22:30:00 FOR ALL THE CARS AND 

22:30:02 ACCESSIBILITY WITH THAT.

22:30:04 AS WELL AS OUTREACH IN DIFFERENT 

22:30:06 LANGUAGES.

22:30:07 IN PARTICULAR WHEN THEY'RE 

22:30:08 TALKING ABOUT WHAT THE FUTURE IS 

22:30:10 OF TRANSIT IN THE WORKFORCE, 

22:30:13 WHETHER IT'S THROUGH THE CHANGES 

22:30:14 THAT THEY'RE IMPLEMENTING WITH 

22:30:16 THE TICKETING, FROM BEING PAPER 

22:30:19 TICKETS TO TRANSIT WITH A PASS, 

22:30:22 IN TERMS OF THE APPS ITSELF AND 

22:30:23 ALSO TRYING TO PUT IN 

22:30:25 CONSIDERATIONS FOR THOSE WHO HAD 

22:30:27 PURCHASED TICKETS AND MAY NOT 

22:30:29 HAVE BEEN ABLE TO TRAVEL DURING 

22:30:29 COVID.

22:30:31 I KNOW THERE WAS A QUESTION 

22:30:32 ABOUT SAFETY AND I ALSO WANTED 

22:30:35 TO HIGHLIGHT THAT WAS AN 

22:30:37 APPROVAL OF AN AGENDA ITEM AT 

22:30:40 THE TRANSPORTATION DISCUSSION TO 

22:30:41 TALK ABOUT SAFETY AND THAT IS 

22:30:42 SOMETHING TO BE NOTED FOR SOME 

22:30:45 OF THE RAIL STATIONS IN 

22:30:46 IMPROVING SECURITY IN TERMS OF 

22:30:47 THE CAMERA SYSTEMS THAT ARE 

22:30:48 BEING UTILIZED.

22:30:49 SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE 

22:30:51 COMMISSIONS THAT I SIT ON IN 

22:30:53 ADDITION TO ENERGY AND OTHERS.

22:30:54 BUT I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR FROM 

22:30:55 ANY OF THE COUNCILMEMBERS IF 

22:30:57 THEY WANTED TO REPORT-OUT ON ANY 

22:30:58 OF THEIR COMMISSIONS AND THAT IS 

22:31:00 ON THE AGENDA ITEM.

22:31:05 FEEL FREE TO RAISE YOUR HAND.

22:31:07 COUNCILMEMBER COX.

22:31:07 >> Councilmember Cox:   YES, I

22:31:18 KITS.
