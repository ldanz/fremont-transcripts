[Captioner] 19:18:09
 SPEAKERS?
>> Mr. Quintanilla: WE HAVE THREE 

[Captioner] 19:18:13
SPEAKER CARDS.
>> Mayor Mei: THESE ARE ITEMS NOT

[Captioner] 19:18:16
 SCHEDULED TONIGHT JUST TO CLARIFY FOR PEOPLE.


[Captioner] 19:18:20
>> Mr. Quintanilla:

[Captioner] 19:18:24
 KEN STEADMAN FOLLOWED BY JOHN HINDS.
>>

[Captioner] 19:18:25
 WELCOME, KEN.
>> GOOD EVENING.


[Captioner] 19:18:29
MY NAME IS KEN STEADMAN.
TODAY AS I

[Captioner] 19:18:31
 WAS WORKING FROM HOME I NOTICED A BAD SOAPY TASTE IN MY MOUTH.


[Captioner] 19:18:34
I WENT AND ASKED MY WIFE ABOUT IT AND SHE TASTED IT TOO.


[Captioner] 19:18:38
THEN I NOTICED A TRUCK DRIVING BY WITH A BIG TANK ON THE BACK SPRAYING

[Captioner] 19:18:41
 A GREENISH BLUE LIQUID ON TO THE STREET IN FRONT OF MY HOUSE.


[Captioner] 19:18:45
THERE WAS A LARGE VOLUME OF LIQUID BEING SPRAYED OUT OF BOTH THE DRIVER 

[Captioner] 19:18:49
AND PASSENGER SIDES OF THE TRUCK AT VERY HIGH PRESSURES, AND A

[Captioner] 19:18:52
 GREENISH MIST WAS VISIBLY WAFTING THROUGH THE AIR FROM THE

[Captioner] 19:18:55
 STREAM TOWARD MY HOUSE.
I IMMEDIATELY SET TO SHUTTING THE 

[Captioner] 19:18:58
WINDOWS IN MY HOME.
I WALKED OVER TO WHERE THE WORKERS HAD

[Captioner] 19:19:00
 PARKED AND ASKED THEM WHAT THEY WERE SPRAYING.


[Captioner] 19:19:04
THEY TOLD ME THEY WERE SPRAYING

[Captioner] 19:19:08
 ROUNDUP ON THE STREET FOR PREPARATION OF RESURSING.


[Captioner] 19:19:11
THE ACTIVE INGREDIENT IS GLIE FOE SAY THE

[Captioner] 19:19:14
 KNOWN TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO CAUSE

[Captioner] 19:19:18
 CANCER OR REPRODUCTIVE HARM AND LISTED UNDER THE SAFE

[Captioner] 19:19:21
 DRINKING WATER AND TOXIC ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 1986.


[Captioner] 19:19:25
THE NATIONAL AGENCY FOR RESEARCH ON CANCER AND

[Captioner] 19:19:29
 THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION REPORT GLIE FOE SAY THE AS

[Captioner] 19:19:33
 LIKELY CAR SINOGENIC.
SEVERAL COUNTRIES HAVE BANNED THE USE

[Captioner] 19:19:36
 OF GLIE FOE SAY THE.
IT'S

[Captioner] 19:19:39
 AN SYNTHESIZED FROM THAT COMPOUND USING FORMALDEHYDE.


[Captioner] 19:19:43
FORMALDEHYDE IS A KNOWN CON

[Captioner] 19:19:47
 CONTAMINANT OF

[Captioner] 19:19:52
 SURFACTANTS AND OTHER ADDITIVES AND ADJUVANTS IN PROPRIETARY BLENDS

[Captioner] 19:19:55
 ARE ALSO KNOWN TO INCREASE TOXICITY.
ACCORDING TO RESEARCH

[Captioner] 19:19:58
 AT MIT, IT OFTEN REPLACES GLYCINE

[Captioner] 19:20:02
 IN PROTEIN BIOSYNTHESIS IN PROPORTION TO ITS AVAILABILITY,

[Captioner] 19:20:05
 CAUSING MALFORMATIONS WHICH ALTER THE FUNCTION OF PROTEINS.


[Captioner] 19:20:08
IT ALSO DISRUPTS TRANSPORT OF ELEMENTS, MINERALS AND COMPOUNDS THROUGHOUT

[Captioner] 19:20:12
 THE BODY, DEGENERATES NEUROTRANSMITTERS, KILLS

[Captioner] 19:20:15
 HEALTHY GUT FLORA AND HAS BEEN CORRELATED WITH AN INCREASED RISK

[Captioner] 19:20:19
 IN NON-HODGKIN'S LYMPHOMA, CELIAC DISEASE AND

[Captioner] 19:20:21
 DOZENS OF OTHER SERIOUS IMMUNE ENDOCRINE AND OTHER DISORDERS.


[Captioner] 19:20:27
CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE DIVISION 20 CHAPTER

[Captioner] 19:20:30
 CHAPTER 6.6 SECTION 2524 SAYS NO

[Captioner] 19:20:33
 PERSON IN THE COURSE OF DOING BUSINESS SHALL KNOWINGLY AND INTENTIONALLY

[Captioner] 19:20:36
 EXPOSE ANY INDIVIDUAL TO A CHEMICAL KNOWN TO THE STATE OF

[Captioner] 19:20:39
 CALIFORNIA TO CAUSE CANCER OR REPRODUCTIVE TOXICITY

[Captioner] 19:20:42
 WITHOUT FIRST GIVING CLEAR AND REASONABLE WARNING TO SUCH AN 

[Captioner] 19:20:45
INDIVIDUAL.
WE DID NOT RECEIVE A WARNING THAT A 

[Captioner] 19:20:48
CHEMICAL KNOWN TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO CAUSE CANCER OR

[Captioner] 19:20:51
 REPRODUCTIVE HARM WOULD BE SPRAYED AT OUR HOUSE.


[Captioner] 19:20:54
ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL PESTICIDE INFORMATION CENTER, PRODUCTS

[Captioner] 19:20:59
 CONTAINING GLYPHOSATE MAY CAUSE EYE OR

[Captioner] 19:21:02
 SKIN  IRRITATION.
PEOPLE WHO BREATHE IT -- I'LL

[Captioner] 19:21:04
 SKIP THIS.
I EXPERIENCED IRRITATION IN MY NOSE 

[Captioner] 19:21:08
AND THROAT AND WAS MILDLY NAUSEOUS.
MY WIFE BECAME VERY

[Captioner] 19:21:11
 NAUSEOUS AND VOMITED.
THIS INDICATES THE AMOUNT OF

[Captioner] 19:21:16
 GLYPHOSATE BEING SPRAYED WAS

[Captioner] 19:21:20
 ABOVE ACCEPTABLE LEVELS.
I'M

[Captioner] 19:21:24
 ALARMED THAT STIFF FREMONT IGNORES STATE LAWS AND UNNECESSARILY

[Captioner] 19:21:28
 SPRAYS COCKTAILS IN A MANNER THAT CAUSES

[Captioner] 19:21:30
 CITIZENS TO BECOME ILL.
>> Mayor Mei: I WAS GOING TO ASK IF 

[Captioner] 19:21:33
YOU WANTED TO TURN IN YOUR COMMENTS, YOU CAN TURN THEM IN TO OUR CLERK AND

[Captioner] 19:21:35
 WE --
>> I'LL EMAIL IT.


[Captioner] 19:21:37
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY.
>> Mr. Quintanilla: OUR NEXT SPEAKER 

[Captioner] 19:21:40
IS JOHN HINDS FOLLOWED BY

[Captioner] 19:21:43
 SALEM MASTON.
>> HELLO, EVERYONE.


[Captioner] 19:21:47
BUCKLE UP NOW.
YOU KNOW, I HAVE REALLY

[Captioner] 19:21:50
 GOOD TASTE IN MUSIC.
AND LISTENING TO IT IS SO BENEFICIAL

[Captioner] 19:21:53
 TO ME THAT I JUST KNOW IT BENEFITS OTHER PEOPLE TOO.


[Captioner] 19:21:56
THAT'S WHY I DRIVE AROUND WITH MY WINDOWS OPEN AND THE

[Captioner] 19:21:59
 STEREO GOING, AND WHENEVER I SEE SOMEBODY, I JUST CRANK IT UP

[Captioner] 19:22:02
 LOUDER UNTIL I SEE A REACTION FROM THEM AND THAT'S WHEN I

[Captioner] 19:22:05
 KNOW I'M MAKING THEIR LIVES BETTER.
NOW,

[Captioner] 19:22:08
 LAST MONTH THERE WAS A STAFF PRESENTATION AND ONE SLIDE

[Captioner] 19:22:11
 MENTIONED THAT WE WANT TO MAKE FREMONT INTO

[Captioner] 19:22:15
 A MODERN 15-MINUTE CITY,

[Captioner] 19:22:18
 EMPHASIZING TRANSIT AND BICYCLES AND PEDESTRIANS.


[Captioner] 19:22:21
SEEING THAT WORD MODERN MADE ME SMILE

[Captioner] 19:22:25
 BECAUSE DENSE 15-MINUTE CITIES BUILT ON TRANSIT AND

[Captioner] 19:22:28
 BICYCLES AND PEDESTRIANS WERE FEATURES OF THE 19TH

[Captioner] 19:22:32
 CORRECT RE.
IN THE 20TH, PEOPLE FLED THOSE PLACES

[Captioner] 19:22:35
 IN LARGE NUMBERS AS SOON AS THEY COULD AFFORD TO BUT

[Captioner] 19:22:38
 LARGE NUMBERS ISN'T EVERYONE.
SOME PEOPLE

[Captioner] 19:22:41
 ACTUALLY LIKE LIVING IN PLACES LIKE SAN FRANCISCO, BLESS THEIR HEARTS, OR 

[Captioner] 19:22:44
NEW YORK.
BUT THAT WORD "MODERN" IS SIGNIFICANT 

[Captioner] 19:22:48
AND TELLING, BECAUSE IT SHOWS THAT PEOPLE WHO SUBSCRIBE TO

[Captioner] 19:22:51
 THE SO CALLED NEW URBANISM SEE

[Captioner] 19:22:54
 THIS NOT AS A MATTER OF TASTE, LIKE THEY DON'T GET MY

[Captioner] 19:22:58
 AWESOME MUSIC MAN, THEY SEE IT INSTEAD AS A MATTER OF

[Captioner] 19:23:01
 IMPORTANT PROGRESS.
THE CORRECT DIRECTION THAT PEOPLE

[Captioner] 19:23:04
 SHOULD DEVELOP IN, WHETHER THEY WANT THAT OR NOT.


[Captioner] 19:23:07
WHICH TAKES US BACK TO SOME EVENT FROM THE 1970s,

[Captioner] 19:23:10
 WHEN CAMBODIA WAS TAKEN OVER BY THE KA MERE ROUGE.


[Captioner] 19:23:15
NOW, THE K.R. WERE NOT NEW URBANISTS, THEY WERE MORE

[Captioner] 19:23:18
 NEW RURALISTS, THEY THOUGHT EVERYBODY SHOULD LEAVE THE CITY AND MOVE OUT TO 

[Captioner] 19:23:20
THE COUNTRY RIGHT NOW.
AND ONCE THEY HAD EMPTIED THEIR CITIES 

[Captioner] 19:23:24
OF PEOPLE, THEY TOOK ANOTHER LOOK AND DECIDED, WELL, IT SEEMS THAT ABOUT

[Captioner] 19:23:27
 A THIRD OF OUR POPULATION IS NOW SURPLUS, SO THEY

[Captioner] 19:23:29
 DID THE LOGICAL THING AND MURDERED THEM.


[Captioner] 19:23:33
AND IF WE LOOK BACK NOW AND ASK WHERE DID THE K.R.

[Captioner] 19:23:36
 GO WRONG, IF YOUR ANSWER IS JUST THAT THEY WENT TOO

[Captioner] 19:23:39
 FAR, YOU WORRY ME.
IF YOU THINK THAT THE

[Captioner] 19:23:43
 BIG PROBLEM IS THEY PREFERRED COUNTRY LIVING OVER CITY

[Captioner] 19:23:46
 LIVING, YOU'VE MISSED THE PLOT.
THE CORE ERROR WAS THEIR CONVICTION 

[Captioner] 19:23:49
THAT THEIR VISION OF PROGRESS WAS SO CORRECT AND

[Captioner] 19:23:52
 SO IMPORTANT, THAT IT SHOULD BE IMPOSED ON EVERYONE ELSE WHETHER THEY

[Captioner] 19:23:55
 WANTED IT OR NOT, BECAUSE

[Captioner] 19:23:59
 ONCE YOU'VE CONVINCED YOURSELF OF THAT MUCH, YOU CAN RATIONALIZE

[Captioner] 19:24:01
 ANYTHING.
IN SHORT, THEY LACKED HUMILITY.


[Captioner] 19:24:06
SPEAKING OF WHICH, YOU WONDER HOW OFTEN NEW URBANISTS ASK

[Captioner] 19:24:09
 THEMSELVES, WELL, YOU KNOW, THERE'S 200,000 REALLY SHARP

[Captioner] 19:24:11
 PEOPLE WHO HAVE CHOSEN TO LIVE IN FREMONT.


[Captioner] 19:24:14
MIGHT THERE BE SOME VALUABLE INFORMATION IN THAT FACT?


[Captioner] 19:24:17
COULD IT BE THAT THOSE PEOPLE ACTUALLY KNOW SOMETHING WE DON'T?


[Captioner] 19:24:23
NAH, OF COURSE NOT.
BY THE WAY, IF YOU ASK, I WILL ROLL 

[Captioner] 19:24:26
DOWN MY WINDOWS AND LET YOU HEAR MY AWESOME

[Captioner] 19:24:29
 MUSIC, AND, SINCE TASTE IS SOMETHING BEST LEFT TO

[Captioner] 19:24:33
 INDIVIDUAL, I WILL LET YOU DECIDE WHEN IT TIME FOR ME TO ROLL THEM BACK UP.


[Captioner] 19:24:36
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:24:38
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
NEXT SPEAKER.


[Captioner] 19:24:42
WELCOME, SALE

[Captioner] 19:24:47
EM.
>>

[Captioner] 19:24:51
 GOOD EVENING, MAYOR, COUNCILMEMBERS,

[Captioner] 19:24:54
 THE STAFF, AND THE PUBLIC OF FREMONT

[Captioner] 19:24:57
.
I HAVE COME

[Captioner] 19:25:01
 HERE TODAY TO REVIVE A

[Captioner] 19:25:04
 2008 ISSUE THAT WAS BURIED BECAUSE OF LACK

[Captioner] 19:25:09
 OF MONEY AND KEPT

[Captioner] 19:25:12
 THE CITY, SOME AREAS, LIKE GHETTO.


[Captioner] 19:25:16
I'M SPECIFICALLY TALKING ABOUT THE CORNER OF FREMONT

[Captioner] 19:25:20
 BOULEVARD AND IRVINGTON, WHERE THERE'S A MARKET AND THE STARBUCKS AND

[Captioner] 19:25:23
 THE CAR WASH, AND THAT

[Captioner] 19:25:26
 AREA IS PURE GHETTO.
WE CAN TURN THAT AREA INTO

[Captioner] 19:25:30
 SOMETHING LIKE SANTANA ROW, AND ALL IT WILL TAKE

[Captioner] 19:25:34
 IS ONE THING THAT THE CITY BRINGS

[Captioner] 19:25:38
 IT BACK UNDER EMINENT DOMAIN, AND THEN I HAVE THE

[Captioner] 19:25:42
 FUNDING, I HAVE THE PEOPLE, I HAVE THE BANK

[Captioner] 19:25:46
S, I HAVE THE RESOURCES TO CONVERT THAT INTO A

[Captioner] 19:25:49
 VERY MODERN SANTANA

[Captioner] 19:25:52
 TYPE ROAD -- AREA.
I'LL CALL IT

[Captioner] 19:25:54
 MASANA ROW BUT FOR THE TIME BEING, I WON'T.


[Captioner] 19:25:58
SO THIS AREA, THE FIVE CORNERS

[Captioner] 19:26:01
 OF FREMONT BOULEVARD, WASHINGTON BOULEVARD, BAY

[Captioner] 19:26:04
 STREET, FREMONT BOULEVARD AND THE UNION STREET, IT IS

[Captioner] 19:26:07
 A CLASSIC EXAMPLE WHERE WE CAN CONVERT

[Captioner] 19:26:11
 FREMONT INTO SOMETHING

[Captioner] 19:26:14
 LIKE SQUARE IN ENGLAND WHERE ALL THE ROADS COME TOGETHER AND

[Captioner] 19:26:18
 IT'S A VERY MODERN SHOPPING AREA WHERE PEOPLE CAN WALK,

[Captioner] 19:26:22
 SHOP, EVERYTHING.
ALL IT NEEDS

[Captioner] 19:26:25
 IS THE CITY'S COOPERATION AND BRINGING IT

[Captioner] 19:26:28
 UNDER EMINENT DOMAIN

[Captioner] 19:26:33
 SO A FAIR MARKET PRICE IS PAID TO -- THERE ARE TWO

[Captioner] 19:26:36
 OWNERS THERE.
ONE OF THEM IS ON BOARD, THE

[Captioner] 19:26:39
 OTHER ONE HAS NOT BEEN WILLING TO

[Captioner] 19:26:44
 SELL THAT PART OF THE PROPERTY, SO WE NEED TO MAKE THIS WHOLE PLACE

[Captioner] 19:26:47
 INTO SOMETHING WHICH WILL NOT

[Captioner] 19:26:50
 ONLY -- BECAUSE 680, WASHINGTON

[Captioner] 19:26:54
 BOULEVARD, IT COMES RIGHT THERE.
WE HAD A PASS-THROUGH

[Captioner] 19:26:55
 SOCIETY.
A PASS-THROUGH CITY.


[Captioner] 19:26:59
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO -- ALL

[Captioner] 19:27:02
 THOSE AREAS, THEY USE MISSION BOULEVARD WHICH BECOMES A MESS.


[Captioner] 19:27:06
WHY NOT CONVERT THAT INTO AN ECONOMIC ZONE WHICH BENEFITS THE CITY, WHICH

[Captioner] 19:27:10
 BENEFITS US, WHICH BENEFITS THE IMAGE OF FREMONT DOWN

[Captioner] 19:27:13
 THE ROAD?
SO I'M REQUESTING THE

[Captioner] 19:27:17
 COUNCIL TO SERIOUSLY CONSIDER TO

[Captioner] 19:27:20
 BRINGING OUR GHETTO AREAS OUT OF THE

[Captioner] 19:27:24
 GHETTO NO

[Captioner] 19:27:27
 SOMETHING, I'VE BEEN HERE 45 YEARS AND SEEN THE CHANGES AND EVERYTHING, WE 

[Captioner] 19:27:30
SHOULD BE NOW MODERN AND PROGRESSIVE.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:27:33
SO MY REQUEST IS AN EMINENT DOMAIN

[Captioner] 19:27:37
 FOR THAT AREA, WHICH IS

[Captioner] 19:27:40
 CALLED THE MONUMENT PLAZA WHERE 600 HOMES CAN BE

[Captioner] 19:27:43
 BUILT.
IT IS A

[Captioner] 19:27:46
 6.5-ACRE LOT WHICH IS CLOSE TO THE BART STATION.


[Captioner] 19:27:49
IT'S -- THE TRANSIT DISTRICT.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.


[Captioner] 19:27:52
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:27:56
>> Mr. Quintanilla: WE HAVE NO ADDITIONAL SPEAKER CARDS.


[Captioner] 19:28:00
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
NEXT ON OUR

[Captioner] 19:28:03
 AGENDA ITEM THIS EVENING ARE THE ITEMS THAT WERE PULLED FROM THE CONSENT 

[Captioner] 19:28:06
CALENDAR.
AND THOSE ARE ITEM

[Captioner] 19:28:10
S -- I BELIEVE 2D AND E.


[Captioner] 19:28:13
>> Mr. Quintanilla: 2E.
>> Mayor Mei: 2E AND

[Captioner] 19:28:15
 2F AND ALSO N AND O.
SO WE'LL BEGIN WITH THOSE.


[Captioner] 19:28:18
>> Mr. Quintanilla: WE HAVE ONE SPEAKER FOR ITEM 2E, KELLY ABREU.


[Captioner] 19:28:27
>> Mayor Mei: WELCOME.


[Captioner] 19:28:30
>> SO THIS ITEM IS ABOUT BUYING FORD

[Captioner] 19:28:34
 VEHICLES AND TRAFFIC SAFETY.


[Captioner] 19:28:38
SO I'M A LITTLE BIT CONCERNED ABOUT HOW YOU

[Captioner] 19:28:41
 OPERATE, HOW THE ELECTED OFFICIALS AN THE EMPLOYEES

[Captioner] 19:28:45
 OF FREMONT OPERATE THOSE FORD VEHICLES

[Captioner] 19:28:48
.
I'M CONCERNED WHETHER THEY'RE BEING 

[Captioner] 19:28:51
OPERATED IN A LAW-ABIDING MANNER, WHETHER THEY'RE BEING OPERATED

[Captioner] 19:28:54
 WITH EQUITY AND

[Captioner] 19:28:58
 JUSTICE, OR WHETHER, ON THE OTHER HAND, THEY'RE BEING OPERATED WITH A 

[Captioner] 19:29:01
SENSE OF ENTITLEMENT AND THE EXPECTATION OF

[Captioner] 19:29:05
 FAVORITISM FROM THE LAW ENFORCEMENT

[Captioner] 19:29:09
 AND THE COMMUNITY SERVICE OFFICERS WHO ARE OUT THERE HANDING OUT PARKING 

[Captioner] 19:29:11
TICKETS.
SO WHY WOULD I SAY THIS?


[Captioner] 19:29:15
WELL, IF YOU LOOK AROUND AT -- WHEN YOU OPENED THAT

[Captioner] 19:29:18
 NEW PARK LAST FRIDAY, IN

[Captioner] 19:29:22
 CENTERVILLE, NEXT TO THE DMV OVER THERE, THE

[Captioner] 19:29:24
 STREETS WERE FULL.
AND AT MISSION PEAK, WHEN THE STREET 

[Captioner] 19:29:28
ARE FULL, PEOPLE WILL SOMETIMES PARK IN A CERTAIN DRIVEWAY NEXT TO AN EMPTY

[Captioner] 19:29:31
 DIRT LOT.
AND THOSE PEOPLE GET PARKING TICKETS.


[Captioner] 19:29:34
THEY PAY THOSE PARKING TICKETS.
A LOT OF

[Captioner] 19:29:38
 PEOPLE HAVE GOTTEN THAT PARKING TICKET FOR BLOCKING THAT DRIVEWAY THAT LEADS

[Captioner] 19:29:41
 TO AN EMPTY LOT, IT'S NEVER BEEN

[Captioner] 19:29:44
 USED, THAT DRIVEWAY, BUT NONETHELESS, THE LAW IS ENFORCED.


[Captioner] 19:29:48
BUT HERE,

[Captioner] 19:29:52
 RIGHT NEXT TO THAT PARK, ACROSS THE STREET, ONE OF YOUR FORD VEHICLES

[Captioner] 19:29:55
 THAT YOU ALREADY OWN WAS PARKED,

[Captioner] 19:29:59
 BLOCKING THE DRIVEWAY TO A USED CAR DEALERSHIP THAT WOULD NEVER

[Captioner] 19:30:02
 BE OPERATED, IT WAS CLOSED AT THAT TIME, BUT IT WAS PLOKING THE

[Captioner] 19:30:05
 BLOCKING THE DRIVEWAY, AND YOUR ELECTED

[Captioner] 19:30:08
 OFFICIAL, ONE OF THE ONLY SEVEN ELECTED OFFICIALS IN THE CITY, HAD 

[Captioner] 19:30:11
THEIR BUSINESS CARD ON THE DASHBOARD, FACE

[Captioner] 19:30:15
 UP, FOR THE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS TO READ FOR THE

[Captioner] 19:30:18
 COMMUNITY SERVICE OFFICERS TO READ, SO THAT THEY COULD SEE CITY

[Captioner] 19:30:21
 OF FREMONT, THE NAME OF THE OFFICIAL, FIRST NAME, LAST

[Captioner] 19:30:24
 NAME, COMMA, AND THE POSITION OF THE

[Captioner] 19:30:28
 OFFICIAL.
THEY EXPECT THAT

[Captioner] 19:30:31
 NOT -- NOT ONLY DO THEY EXPECT TO BE ENTITLED TO

[Captioner] 19:30:34
 FREE, PING EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE NOT AN EMERGENCY VEHICLE,

[Captioner] 19:30:38
 THEY EXPECT THAT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE READING THAT CARD AND

[Captioner] 19:30:41
 HOLDING THE TICKET BOOK, THEY EXPECT THOSE

[Captioner] 19:30:44
 PEOPLE TO EXERCISE FAVORITISM

[Captioner] 19:30:48
, FAVORITISM.
THEY EXPECT IT PROBABLY WORKS,

[Captioner] 19:30:51
 IT PROBABLY WORKS WHEN YOU WHIP OUT YOUR BUSINESS CARDS

[Captioner] 19:30:54
 AND SHOW PEOPLE WHO YOU ARE, EVEN THOUGH YOUR

[Captioner] 19:30:57
 VEHICLE DOESN'T SAY -- HAVE FLASHING RED LIGHTS ON TOP OF IT.


[Captioner] 19:31:02
THIS KIND OF FAVORITISM, ESPECIALLY WHEN COMPARED TO YOUR TREATMENT OF THE

[Captioner] 19:31:06
 VISITORS AT MISSION

[Captioner] 19:31:07
 PEAK, NEEDS TO STOP.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:31:15
>> Mayor Mei: NEXT ITEM?
2F.


[Captioner] 19:31:19
>> Mr. Quintanilla: THAT WAS OUR --
>> Mayor

[Captioner] 19:31:22
 Mei: WAS IT ALSO 2F?
>> Mr. Quintanilla:

[Captioner] 19:31:23
 ALSO 2F.
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY.


[Captioner] 19:31:26
2F.
I THINK WE ALSO HAVE A COUNCILMEMBER.


[Captioner] 19:31:29
THAT'S WHAT I WAS GOING TO ASK.


[Captioner] 19:31:36
>> Councilmember Campbell: DO WE HAVE ANY SPEAKERS ON THIS ONE?


[Captioner] 19:31:39
>> Mr. Quintanilla: WE ALSO HAVE KELLY ABREU FOR 2F.


[Captioner] 19:31:40
>> Councilmember Campbell: YOU WANT ME TO GO FIRST?


[Captioner] 19:31:43
>> Mayor Mei: YES, PLEASE.
HE SAID HE DOESN'T WANT TO SPEAK ON 

[Captioner] 19:31:43
THAT.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:31:47
>> Councilmember Campbell: OKAY.
SO I WOULD LIKE TO --

[Captioner] 19:31:50
 ACTUALLY I THINK THIS IS A WONDERFUL OPPORTUNITY

[Captioner] 19:31:53
 TO PARTNER WITH THE FREMONT UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT FOR THE

[Captioner] 19:31:55
 SAFETY OF OUR STUDENTS, AND THEIR FAMILIES.


[Captioner] 19:31:59
I JUST HAD ONE QUICK QUESTION.
ARE THE PARENTS GOING

[Captioner] 19:32:01
 TO BE PART OF THE TRAINING OF THIS AS WELL?


[Captioner] 19:32:05
I DON'T KNOW, I DIDN'T ASK THAT QUESTION EARLIER.


[Captioner] 19:32:09
>> Mayor Mei: SURE.
>> Councilmember Campbell: BUT I WOULD 

[Captioner] 19:32:11
HAVE --
>> Mayor Mei: HANS IS HERE.


[Captioner] 19:32:15
 HERE TO ANSWER IF WE'RE INCLUDING THE TRAINING

[Captioner] 19:32:17
 FOR THAT?
>> Councilmember Campbell: I APOLOGIZE 

[Captioner] 19:32:20
FOR NOT ASKING THAT EARLIER.
I JUST THOUGHT ABOUT IT

[Captioner] 19:32:22
.
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: MAYOR, AS WE 

[Captioner] 19:32:25
SET UP HERE, WE HAVE TO GO BACK TO VOTE ON THE PRIOR ITEM WHEN YOU GET A 

[Captioner] 19:32:26
CHANCE.
>> Mayor Mei: YES, THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:32:29
I WASN'T SURE BECAUSE I THOUGHT THE SPEAKER WAS SPEAKING ON BOTH.


[Captioner] 19:32:32
THAT'S WHY.


[Captioner] 19:32:34
>> Mr. Larsen: HI.
HANS LARSEN, PUBLIC WORKS DIRECTOR.


[Captioner] 19:32:41
PRIMARILY THESE SERVICES ARE FOR ASSEMBLIES WITHIN THE SCHOOL AND

[Captioner] 19:32:44
 FOR STUDENTS, SO THERE'S A VARIETY OF

[Captioner] 19:32:49
 DIFFERENT THINGS THAT'S TEACHING

[Captioner] 19:32:52
 SAFETY FOR KID TO WALK AND BIKE TO SCHOOL, SO MANY OF THEM

[Captioner] 19:32:53
 ARE DONE WITHIN THE ASSEMBLY ENVIRONMENT.


[Captioner] 19:32:57
THERE'S SOME PROGRAMS THAT ARE

[Captioner] 19:33:01
 BASED ON THE PHYSICAL EDUCATION CURRICULUM

[Captioner] 19:33:04
 SO THAT THERE'S SUPPORT SERVICES FOR P.E.

[Captioner] 19:33:08
 TEACHERS TO DO WALKING OR

[Captioner] 19:33:11
 BIKING RODEOS, YOU KNOW, WITHIN THE SCHOOL

[Captioner] 19:33:15
 CAMPUS, AND THEN THERE'S ALSO SOME SERVICES THAT TEACH

[Captioner] 19:33:18
 CHILDREN HOW TO FIX AND REPAIR BIKES.


[Captioner] 19:33:20
SO MIDDLE SCHOOL AND HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS.


[Captioner] 19:33:24
SO AS FAR AS I KNOW, THEY'RE NOT ORIENTED

[Captioner] 19:33:28
 TOWARDS SORT OF PARENTS OR FAMILIES, BUT THERE ARE SOME

[Captioner] 19:33:32
 PROGRAMS AVAILABLE THROUGH BIKE EAST

[Captioner] 19:33:35
 BAY FOR FAMILIES TO DO RODEOS IN

[Captioner] 19:33:39
 ADDITION TO THE SCHOOL-BASED PROGRAM

[Captioner] 19:33:42
 AND THERE'S ALSO A LOT OF

[Captioner] 19:33:45
 OPPORTUNITIES, BIKE FREMONT ALSO HOSTS TRAINING

[Captioner] 19:33:47
 OPPORTUNITIES TO FIX AND REPAIR BICYCLES.


[Captioner] 19:33:51
SO AND THIS IS A COMPLEMENT TO

[Captioner] 19:33:55
 A PROGRAM THAT ALAMEDA COUNTY ALSO RUNS, SO

[Captioner] 19:33:58
 THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE, AND I THINK

[Captioner] 19:34:01
 OUR INTENT IS TO HAVE SOMETHING MORE

[Captioner] 19:34:04
 THAN THE OTHER ONES OUT THERE TO BEST MEET THE NEEDS OF

[Captioner] 19:34:08
 THE SCHOOL.
I THINK IT'S A GOOD

[Captioner] 19:34:12
 QUESTION THAT WE CAN ASK OUR PARTNERS AT FREMONT UNIFIED SCHOOL

[Captioner] 19:34:15
 DISTRICT IF THERE ARE SOME PARTICULAR NEEDS FOR FAMILIES THAT

[Captioner] 19:34:18
 COULD BE DONE THROUGH THE

[Captioner] 19:34:20
 SCHOOLS.
AS THE COUNCIL KNOWS, WE'RE ENGAGING 

[Captioner] 19:34:23
IN A NEW ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION PLAN, WE WANT TO ENCOURAGE MORE

[Captioner] 19:34:27
 WALKING AND BIKING IN THE COMMUNITY, AND THROUGH

[Captioner] 19:34:30
 THIS PLANNING PROCESS, IF THERE'S INPUT THAT

[Captioner] 19:34:33
 WE HEAR FROM THE COMMUNITY ON SUPPLEMENTAL

[Captioner] 19:34:35
 SERVICES, WE CAN INTEGRATE THAT INTO OUR PLANNING PROCESS.


[Captioner] 19:34:39
>> Councilmember Campbell: THAT'S WONDERFUL.


[Captioner] 19:34:42
I THINK THAT MY MAJOR CONCERN, AND I THINK WE TALKED ABOUT

[Captioner] 19:34:46
 THIS IN OUR LIAISON COMMITTEE MEETINGS A NUMBER OF TIMES WHEN WE TALK ABOUT

[Captioner] 19:34:49
 THE SAFE ROUTES TO SCHOOL AND THE ROCKING AND THE

[Captioner] 19:34:53
 ROLLING, IS BECAUSE WE HAVE HAD SOME

[Captioner] 19:34:56
 INCIDENCES THAT CHILDREN WERE NOT -- DIDN'T KNOW HOW

[Captioner] 19:35:00
 TO RIDE THEIR BIKES IN THE BEST

[Captioner] 19:35:03
 SAFETY POSSIBLE.
AND PARTICULARLY, I SEE IT ALL THE

[Captioner] 19:35:06
 TIME TOO, TO GET OFF YOUR BIKE, WALK IT ACROSS

[Captioner] 19:35:09
 THE STREET, YOU KNOW, WE HAVE SOME MAJOR

[Captioner] 19:35:13
 INTERSECTIONS THAT CHILDREN GO OVER IN THEIR BIKES, FREMONT

[Captioner] 19:35:17
 BOULEVARD, PASEO PADRE, MOWRY, SOME OF THOSE OTHER

[Captioner] 19:35:20
 STREETS THAT I SEE CHILDREN RIDING THEIR BIKES ON THAT THEY HAVEN'T

[Captioner] 19:35:23
 BEEN PROPERLY TRAINED THAT THEY NEED TO GET OFF THE BIKE AND

[Captioner] 19:35:27
 WALK IT OVER AS OPPOSED TO RIDING

[Captioner] 19:35:30
 IT OVER.


[Captioner] 19:35:33
SO -- AND I THINK THAT SHOULD ALSO BE A PART OF SOME OF THE LESSONS THAT

[Captioner] 19:35:36
 WE HELP THEIR PARENTS UNDERSTAND SO THAT THEIR PARENTS

[Captioner] 19:35:39
 CAN REINFORCE WHAT THE SCHOOL IS ALREADY DOING IN TERMS OF SAFETY.


[Captioner] 19:35:43
SO THAT'S WHY I THINK THAT THIS IS A

[Captioner] 19:35:46
 WONDERFUL OPPORTUNITY, BUT I REALLY WANT US TO REALLY FOCUS ON HOW WE 

[Captioner] 19:35:49
COULD TREAT THE WHOLE FAMILY AND

[Captioner] 19:35:53
 HELPING THEIR CHILDREN BE SAFE ON THE BICYCLES AND

[Captioner] 19:35:56
 SKATING AND OTHER ROCKING AND ROLLING THINGS THAT KIDS MAY

[Captioner] 19:35:59
 DO, SKATEBOARDING, I THINK IT'S VERY

[Captioner] 19:36:02
 IMPORTANT THAT THEY HAVE SOME MORE SAFETY

[Captioner] 19:36:05
 LESSONS.
>> Mr. Larsen: APPRECIATE THAT 

[Captioner] 19:36:08
COMMENT, AND I THINK THE CONTRACT HAS SORT OF A LEVEL OF

[Captioner] 19:36:11
 FLEXIBILITY TO IT, AND SO IF WE

[Captioner] 19:36:15
 CAN DESIGN SOME PROGRAMS FOR FAMILIES, WE'D

[Captioner] 19:36:18
 BE HAPPY TO DO THAT.
IT'S VERY CONSISTENT WITH

[Captioner] 19:36:21
 OUR OVERALL ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM THAT

[Captioner] 19:36:24
 WE HAVE HERE IN FREMONT.
>> Councilmember Campbell: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:36:28
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS, COUNCILMEMBER.


[Captioner] 19:36:32
I KNOW THAT THIS IS SOMETHING WE HAVE WORKED ON MANY

[Captioner] 19:36:35
 YEARS AGO WITH THE SCHOOL BOARD AND THE PTAs, AS WELL

[Captioner] 19:36:38
 AS THE CITY AT THAT TIME, AND I THINK IT'S A GOOD TIME SINCE

[Captioner] 19:36:41
 THERE'S SO MANY CHANGES THAT HAVE HAPPENED FOR US TO EVALUATE SOME

[Captioner] 19:36:44
 OF THOSE UPDATES ON THOSE ROUTES.
SO I APPRECIATE THAT AT THE SAME

[Captioner] 19:36:47
 TIME.


[Captioner] 19:36:51
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN.
>> Councilmember Kassan: SORRY, I 

[Captioner] 19:36:53
DON'T KNOW IF YOU SAW THAT I PRESSED MY BUTTON.


[Captioner] 19:36:56
I JUST FELT LIKE I REALLY NEEDED TO MAKE

[Captioner] 19:36:59
 A COMMENT.
WE HAVE MANY IMMIGRANTS IN

[Captioner] 19:37:03
 THIS CITY, AS WELL AS CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN OF

[Captioner] 19:37:06
 IMMIGRANTS, AND SADLY, SOME OF THE COUNTRIES THAT SOME OF

[Captioner] 19:37:09
 THESE FOLKS HAVE COME FROM HAVE

[Captioner] 19:37:12
 HAD HORRIBLE GENOCIDES, AND

[Captioner] 19:37:16
 IT'S A VERY TRAUMATIC THING, AND I THINK

[Captioner] 19:37:20
 TO COMPARE EFFORTS TO MAKE OUR STREET SAFER FOR

[Captioner] 19:37:23
 PEDESTRIANS TO A GENOCIDE IS REALLY

[Captioner] 19:37:26
 OFFENSIVE AND COULD CAUSE A LOT OF TRAUMA FOR THOSE WHO HAVE ACTUALLY

[Captioner] 19:37:29
 COME FROM PLACES WHERE GENOCIDE HAS HAPPENED.


[Captioner] 19:37:32
SO I JUST REALLY WANT TO ASK THE PUBLIC, YOU KNOW, IN

[Captioner] 19:37:36
 YOUR -- OBVIOUSLY WE WELCOME FREE SPEECH IN

[Captioner] 19:37:39
 OUR COMMUNITY, BUT I JUST REALLY WANT TO ASK THE PUBLIC TO

[Captioner] 19:37:42
 BE SENSITIVE WHEN MAKING COMMENTS AND BE

[Captioner] 19:37:46
 AWARE OF THE DIVERSITY OF OUR COMMUNITY AND THE BACKGROUNDS THAT 

[Captioner] 19:37:49
PEOPLE COME FROM AND TRAUMA THAT THEY MAY HAVE FACED.


[Captioner] 19:37:51
THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU, COUNCILMEMBER 

[Captioner] 19:37:53
KASSAN.
I ALSO SEE COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN.


[Captioner] 19:37:58
>> Councilmember Salwan: I'D LIKE TO MOVE THIS ITEM FORWARD

[Captioner] 19:38:00
.
>> Mayor Mei: WE'RE GOING TO FIRST 

[Captioner] 19:38:03
MOVE ITEM 2E, RIGHT?
YES, 2E.


[Captioner] 19:38:07
MOTION BY COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN AND SECONDED BY VICE MAYOR COX.


[Captioner] 19:38:10
THIS IS FOR ITEM 2E, WHICH WAS AGAIN TO

[Captioner] 19:38:12
 CLARIFY, WAS THE PURCHASE OF FLEET VEHICLES.


[Captioner] 19:38:15
PLEASE VOTE.


[Captioner] 19:38:23
THANK YOU.
THE MOTION PASSES UNANIMOUSLY.


[Captioner] 19:38:27

[Captioner] 19:38:30
AND THEN WAS THERE ANYONE -- 2F, MOTION BY COUNCILMEMBER

[Captioner] 19:38:34
 SALWAN, SECONDED BY VICE MAYOR COX.


[Captioner] 19:38:40
PLEASE VOTE.


[Captioner] 19:38:48
AND THE MOTION PASSES EXCEPT FOR -- WELL,

[Captioner] 19:38:51
 ACTUALLY IT PASSES WITH THE MAJORITY, BUT COUNCILMEMBER COX VOTING NO.


[Captioner] 19:38:55
>> Vice Mayor Cox: THAT SHOULD BE YES.
I HIT THE WRONG BUTTON.


[Captioner] 19:38:58
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY.
COULD WE PLEASE CORRECT THAT

[Captioner] 19:39:01
?
OR JUST TAKE A RE-VOTE.


[Captioner] 19:39:03

I THINK THEY'RE ON ZOOM?

[Captioner] 19:39:32

[Captioner] 19:39:37
>> GOOD EVENING.
THIS IS SHARON VENTURA

[Captioner] 19:39:41
.
I WAS HOP

[Captioner] 19:39:44
ING ITEM N WAS A BELATED

[Captioner] 19:39:47
 APRIL FOOL'S DAY JOKE.
IN OUR CURRENT SOCIAL AND FISCAL TIME,

[Captioner] 19:39:51
 LAYOFFS ABOUND, DEVELOPMENT ESCALATING IN SPITE OF

[Captioner] 19:39:54
 OUR NATURAL RESOURCE SHORTAGES, OUR STREETS

[Captioner] 19:39:57
 AND PARKS AND NEIGHBORHOODS ARE BECOMING A DISGRACE.


[Captioner] 19:39:59
AND I'M NOT SURE -- DO WE STILL HAVE A POLICE DEPARTMENT?


[Captioner] 19:40:07
THE HOMELESS ENCAM MMENTS

[Captioner] 19:40:10
 ARE GROWING IN LEAPS AND BOUNDS AND TRASH AND HEALTH HAZARDS

[Captioner] 19:40:13
 AND CRIME AND ENDANGERMENT IN OUR NEIGHBORHOODS AND

[Captioner] 19:40:16
 PARKS, AND YOU'RE PLANNING ON GIVING THE CITY ATTORNEY A

[Captioner] 19:40:19
 5% RAISE ON A

[Captioner] 19:40:24
 $326,000 SALARY FOR WHAT?


[Captioner] 19:40:27
BATTLING THE LAST CRIMINAL CITY MANAGER HIRE OF MARK DANAJ

[Captioner] 19:40:31
 BY OUR COUNCIL, WHO LUCKILY HAS AMPLE FUNDS FROM

[Captioner] 19:40:34
 OUR POCKETS TO WASTE MORE OF OUR TIME AND RESOURCES.


[Captioner] 19:40:38
OBVIOUSLY, THIS MUST BE A TYPO.
HOW ABOUT

[Captioner] 19:40:41
 WITHDRAWING THIS ITEM AND GETTING TO WORK?


[Captioner] 19:40:44
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:40:46
>> Mayor Mei: ARE THERE ANY OTHER SPEAKERS ON THIS?


[Captioner] 19:40:50
>> Mr. Quintanilla: NO ADDITIONAL SPEAKERS.


[Captioner] 19:40:53
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
I'LL BRING

[Captioner] 19:40:56
 THE AGENDA ITEM BACK TO THE COUNCIL.
>> Vice Mayor Cox: SO MOVE.


[Captioner] 19:40:59
>> Mayor Mei: MOVED BY VICE MAYOR COX AND SECONDED

[Captioner] 19:41:02
 BY COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN.
THESE ARE ITEMS 2N AND

[Captioner] 19:41:04
 2O, IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:41:08
PLEASE VOTE.
OR DO WE NEED

[Captioner] 19:41:10
 TO TAKE THEM SEPARATELY?
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: WE NEED TO 

[Captioner] 19:41:12
TAKE EACH SEPARATELY SINCE THEY WERE YOU  D.


[Captioner] 19:41:15
I DIDN'T CATCH THE SECOND.
>> DO WE NEED A REPORT

[Captioner] 19:41:17
 OUT FROM THE HR DIRECTOR?
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: CORRECT.


[Captioner] 19:41:19
THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: YES, 2N FIRST, PLEASE.


[Captioner] 19:41:24
>> GOOD EVENING, MADAME MAYOR AND COUNCILMEMBERS.


[Captioner] 19:41:27
AS REQUIRED BY GOVERNMENT CODE SECTION

[Captioner] 19:41:31
 54953, I'LL PROVIDE A REPORT SUMMARIZING THE

[Captioner] 19:41:34
 RECOMMENDATION FOR A THIRD AMENDMENT TO THE CITY ATTORNEY'S EMPLOYMENT

[Captioner] 19:41:37
 AGREEMENT THAT IS ITEM 2N, AND A THIRD AMENDMENT TO THE

[Captioner] 19:41:41
 CITY MANAGER'S EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT, WHICH IS ITEM 2O.


[Captioner] 19:41:46
SO FIRST FOR ADOPTION IS A RESOLUTION THAT AMENDS THE CITY ATTORNEY'S 

[Captioner] 19:41:50
EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT TO PROVIDE A 5% SALARY INCREASE

[Captioner] 19:41:53
 WHICH IS EQUAL TO THE PERCENTAGE THAT IS BEING PROVIDED TO

[Captioner] 19:41:56
 THE CITY'S MISCELLANEOUS REPRESENTED EMPLOYEES.


[Captioner] 19:42:00
THIS WOULD INCREASE THE CITY ATTORNEY'S BASE SALARY

[Captioner] 19:42:03
 BY $16,261 ANNUALLY FOR A

[Captioner] 19:42:06
 TOTAL ANNUAL SALARY OF

[Captioner] 19:42:10
 $341,499.
ON ITEM 2O, AGAIN AS REQUIRED

[Captioner] 19:42:13
 BY GOVERNMENT CODE SECTION

[Captioner] 19:42:17
 54953, TONIGHT FOR COUNCIL'S CONSIDERATION IS ALSO THE ADOPTION OF

[Captioner] 19:42:20
 A RESOLUTION THAT AMENDS THE CITY MANAGER'S EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT

[Captioner] 19:42:24
 TO ALSO PROVIDE A 5% SALARY INCREASE, WHICH IS EQUAL

[Captioner] 19:42:27
 TO THE PERCENTAGE THAT'S BEING INCREASED

[Captioner] 19:42:29
 FOR CITY'S MISCELLANEOUS REPRESENTED EMPLOYEES.


[Captioner] 19:42:33
THIS WOULD INCREASE THE CITY MANAGER'S BASE SALARY

[Captioner] 19:42:37
 BY $19,379 ANNUALLY, FOR A

[Captioner] 19:42:40
 TOTAL ANNUAL SALARY OF

[Captioner] 19:42:44
 $406,963.
AND WITH THAT, I WILL TURN IT OVER TO

[Captioner] 19:42:45
 YOU, MAYOR MEI.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:42:48
WE HAD A MOTION FOR THE FIRST ITEM, WHICH

[Captioner] 19:42:51
 IS 2N BY VICE MAYOR COX AND SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN.


[Captioner] 19:42:55
>> Vice Mayor Cox: AND I MOVE ON

[Captioner] 19:42:57
 2O.
>> Mayor Mei: THE FIRST ONE FIRST.


[Captioner] 19:43:02
2N, I THINK.


[Captioner] 19:43:06
WE NEED TO TAKE THIS ITEM SEPARATELY.
PLEASE VOTE.


[Captioner] 19:43:19
SO THE MOTION PASSES UNANIMOUSLY FOR ITEM 2N.


[Captioner] 19:43:22
IS THERE A MOTION FOR 2O?
MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN,

[Captioner] 19:43:25
 SECONDED BY VICE MAYOR COX.
PLEASE

[Captioner] 19:43:29
 VOTE.


[Captioner] 19:43:36
AND THE MOTION PASSES UNANIMOUSLY.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:43:41
AND NOW WE'LL RETURN TO OUR REGULARLY SCHEDULED ITEMS THIS

[Captioner] 19:43:45
 EVENING.
THE FIRST

[Captioner] 19:43:49
 BEING ITEM 5A, WHICH IS

[Captioner] 19:43:52
 WASHINGTON BOULEVARD, AND IT'S A STREET VACATION THERE.


[Captioner] 19:43:55
AND OUR PUBLIC WORKS DIRECTOR, HANS LARSEN, IS AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS.


[Captioner] 19:43:59
THERE'S NO PRESENTATION ON THIS.
ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS

[Captioner] 19:44:03
 AT THIS TIME FROM THE COUNCILMEMBERS ON THIS ITEM BEFORE I OPEN THE

[Captioner] 19:44:06
 PUBLIC HEARING ON THIS?


[Captioner] 19:44:13
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN?
>> Councilmember Salwan: THANK YOU, 

[Captioner] 19:44:16
MADAME MAYOR.
JUST TO CLARIFY WHAT IS OUR PURVIEW 

[Captioner] 19:44:19
AND WHAT HAS BEEN APPROVED ALREADY IN THIS DECISION

[Captioner] 19:44:22
 TONIGHT?
IS THAT MR. LARSEN

[Captioner] 19:44:26
 OR SOMEONE ELSE?


[Captioner] 19:44:30
MR. LARSEN?
>> Mayor Mei: HE'S COMING, YES.


[Captioner] 19:44:44
>> Mr. Larsen: MAYOR MEI, MEMBERS OF THE

[Captioner] 19:44:48
 COUNCIL, I'M HANS LARSEN AND JOINED BY OUR

[Captioner] 19:44:49
 DEVELOPMENT SERVICES MANAGER IN PUBLIC WORKS.


[Captioner] 19:44:54
SO THE ITEM BEFORE YOU FOR

[Captioner] 19:44:57
 APPROVAL IS THE

[Captioner] 19:45:00
 VACATION OF A SMALL SECTION OF

[Captioner] 19:45:04
 WASHINGTON BOULEVARD

[Captioner] 19:45:08
 THAT'S ADJOINING A APPROVED DEVELOPMENT PROJECT THAT WAS

[Captioner] 19:45:12
 APPROVED KIND OF THROUGH THE REGULAR CITY PLANNING

[Captioner] 19:45:15
 PROCESS, IT WAS APPROVED BY THE PLANNING COMMISSION IN JULY

[Captioner] 19:45:19
 OF 2022.
AS A CONDITION OF APPROVAL OF THAT

[Captioner] 19:45:23
 DEVELOPMENT, IT WAS RECOGNIZED THAT THE

[Captioner] 19:45:26
 RIGHT-OF-WAY WIDTH OF WASHINGTON BOULEVARD VARIES

[Captioner] 19:45:30
 KIND OF WITHIN THE CORRIDOR, AND THE PURPOSE OF

[Captioner] 19:45:33
 THIS ACTION IS TO

[Captioner] 19:45:36
 BRING THE CURB LINE, THE

[Captioner] 19:45:39
 SIDEWALK LINE WITHIN THE PUBLIC STREET RIGHT-OF-WAY INTO

[Captioner] 19:45:43
 A CONSISTENT WIDTH.
AND SO

[Captioner] 19:45:46
 THERE'S 7 FEET BY 200 FEET OF ROADWAY THERE THAT'S

[Captioner] 19:45:49
 NO LONGER NEEDED.
AND SO THERE'S

[Captioner] 19:45:52
 A PROCESS IN ORDER TO VACATE IT.
SO THIS IS NOT ABOUT

[Captioner] 19:45:55
 APPROVING THE DEVELOPMENT OR ADDRESSING THAT.


[Captioner] 19:45:58
THAT'S ALREADY BEEN DONE.
THE CONDITION OF

[Captioner] 19:46:01
 APPROVAL OF THE DEVELOPMENT IS TO CLEAN UP THE RIGHT-OF-WAY HERE, AND 

[Captioner] 19:46:05
THAT'S THE ACTION THAT'S BEFORE COUNCIL HERE TODAY

[Captioner] 19:46:08
.
>> Councilmember Salwan: THANK YOU FOR 

[Captioner] 19:46:10
THAT CLARIFICATION.
HOW WILL THIS HELP WITH HEALTH OR 

[Captioner] 19:46:14
SAFETY AS FAR AS PEDESTRIAN OR CARS OR HOW WILL

[Captioner] 19:46:17
 THIS IMPROVE THAT AREA?
>> Mr. Larsen: SO THIS

[Captioner] 19:46:20
 WILL PROVIDE JUST IMPROVED

[Captioner] 19:46:23
 ALIGNMENT OF THE ROADWAY SO THERE'S A CONSISTENT WIDTH, AND THAT WILL MAKE 

[Captioner] 19:46:26
IT EASIER FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE DRIVING, WALKING AND BIKING IN THE

[Captioner] 19:46:31
 CORRIDOR, THAT THERE'S NOT AN OFFSET

[Captioner] 19:46:34
 OR A JOG IN THE ROADWAY, SO WE'LL HAVE A UNIFORM STREET ALIGNMENT.


[Captioner] 19:46:37
THIS IS CONSISTENT

[Captioner] 19:46:41
 WITH THE WIDTHS THAT HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED ON EITHER SIDE OF THE

[Captioner] 19:46:42
 PROPOSED -- OR THE APPROVED DEVELOPMENT.


[Captioner] 19:46:47
>> Councilmember Salwan: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:46:53
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
ARE THERE ANY SPEAKER CARDS ON THIS 

[Captioner] 19:46:55
ITEM?
>> Mr. Quintanilla: WE HAVE ONE HAND 

[Captioner] 19:46:57
RAISED IN ZOOM.
SHARON VENTURA.


[Captioner] 19:47:00
>> Mayor Mei: WELCOME.
>> HI.


[Captioner] 19:47:03
I'M NOT SPEAKING ABOUT THIS UNBELIEVABLY, BUT I

[Captioner] 19:47:06
 HAD ASKED FOR 2N TO BE PULLED AND I GUESS YOU VOTED

[Captioner] 19:47:09
 ON IT BEFORE COMMENTS.


[Captioner] 19:47:15
CAN YOU RESPOND TO THAT?
>> Mayor Mei: I THOUGHT WE HAD

[Captioner] 19:47:18
 ASKED, I APOLOGIZE.
I THOUGHT YOU SPOKE ON BOTH OF THEM.


[Captioner] 19:47:19
>> NO.
>> Mayor Mei: MY APOLOGIES.


[Captioner] 19:47:23
>> OKAY.
GREAT.


[Captioner] 19:47:26
NOT SURPRISING.
>> Mayor Mei: WE CAN GO BACK AND 

[Captioner] 19:47:27
REVOTE ON THAT.
YOU CAN SPEAK FIRST.


[Captioner] 19:47:32
 -- GOING TO UPSET ME.
>> THAT WOULD BE GREAT.


[Captioner] 19:47:35
>> Mayor Mei: GO AHEAD.
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: THROUGH THE 

[Captioner] 19:47:38
MAYOR, THERE'S NO NEED TO RE-VOTE BUT YOU CAN CERTAINLY ACCEPT PUBLIC 

[Captioner] 19:47:38
COMMENT.
>> Mayor Mei: SURE.


[Captioner] 19:47:41
GO AHEAD.
>> OKAY.


[Captioner] 19:47:46
WELL, CRIME AND ACCIDENTS ARE ESCALATING

[Captioner] 19:47:49
, POLICE PRESENCE IS UNDETECTABLE AND

[Captioner] 19:47:52
 INEFFECTIVE, WHICH I DON'T BELIEVE IS NECESSARILY THE DEPARTMENT'S DOING.


[Captioner] 19:47:56
HOMELESSNESS ENCAMPMENTS IN OUR ONCE MAINTAINED NEIGHBORHOODS AND PUBLIC 

[Captioner] 19:47:59
PARKS ARE OVERFLOWING WITH TRASH, HEALTH HAZARDS, AND

[Captioner] 19:48:03
 PRESENT EXTREME DANGER TO THE ENTIRE ENVIRONMENT.


[Captioner] 19:48:06
DID YOU KNOW THAT THERE WAS A --

[Captioner] 19:48:09
 SET UP IN THE MIDDLE OF VALLEJO MILLS, GATEWAY

[Captioner] 19:48:12
 TO FREMONT, IN A DRIED OUT, STRASH-STREWN FIELD?


[Captioner] 19:48:15
YET YOU HAVE THE AUDACITY TO INFORM YOUR EMPLOYERS, THAT'S

[Captioner] 19:48:19
 US, THE CITIZENS, THAT YOU INTEND TO GIVE A 5% RAISE

[Captioner] 19:48:22
 TO A POSITION

[Captioner] 19:48:27
 IN TITLE ONLY THAT CURRENTLY

[Captioner] 19:48:29
 PAYS $388,000 A YEAR.
SO IN ORDER TO HELP THE CITY OUT, I 

[Captioner] 19:48:32
HAVE A PROPOSAL.
I WILL GLADLY DO

[Captioner] 19:48:35
 THE JOB, NO EXPERIENCE OR KNOWLEDGE OF THE LAW

[Captioner] 19:48:38
 OR RESPONSIBILITIES OF OFFICE ARE

[Captioner] 19:48:42
 NEEDED, AND IT WOULD BE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO DO ANY WORSE

[Captioner] 19:48:44
 THAN WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS.


[Captioner] 19:48:47
AND I'LL DO IT FOR A MERE $200,000.


[Captioner] 19:48:52
A $200,000 SAVINGS TO THE CITY OF

[Captioner] 19:48:55
 FREMONT, WHICH YOU COULD SPEND ON FURTHER

[Captioner] 19:48:59
 OVERDEVELOPMENT IN A SHRINKING

[Captioner] 19:49:02
 ECONOMY, PUT TOWARDS GREEN PAINT, PLASTIC AND METAL,

[Captioner] 19:49:04
 OR MAKE MORE PARKING TO BRING IN MORE CARS.


[Captioner] 19:49:08
OF COURSE I WILL NEED A COMMUTE

[Captioner] 19:49:11
 COMPENSATION FROM NILES TO CITY HALL, DUE TO THE NIGHTMARE COMMUTE

[Captioner] 19:49:15
 YOUR DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC WORKS HAS CREATED, WHOSE

[Captioner] 19:49:18
 SALARY IS CLOSE TO $400,000, IF

[Captioner] 19:49:21
 MEMORY SERVES ME CORRECTLY.
I DON'T WANT

[Captioner] 19:49:25
 MY FLIPPANCY TO UNDERMINE MY

[Captioner] 19:49:29
 GRAVE CONCERNS, BUT FRANKLY, I CAN'T ADDRESS THIS IN ANY OTHER WAY

[Captioner] 19:49:29
 WITHOUT STROKING OUT.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:49:34
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:49:37
DO WE NEED

[Captioner] 19:49:40
 TO REVOTE ON THAT?
UNLESS ANYONE WOULD LIKE TO CHANGE?


[Captioner] 19:49:42
OKAY.
CAN WE CONTINUE WITH OUR NEXT AGENDA 

[Captioner] 19:49:44
ITEM?
I THINK WE HAVE -- COUNCILMEMBER COX, 

[Captioner] 19:49:46
DID YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO ADD?
>> Vice Mayor Cox: I HAVE A QUESTION.


[Captioner] 19:49:52
AND MY QUESTION WAS ON

[Captioner] 19:49:55
 5A.
AND I KNOW THAT THERE'S BEEN A

[Captioner] 19:49:59
 LOT OF REROUTING AND

[Captioner] 19:50:01
 JUST WANTED TO DOUBLE-CHECK IN TERMS OF THE BEST ROUTE, BECAUSE WE KNOW 

[Captioner] 19:50:05
THAT SOME OF THE STUDENTS NEAR OHLONE COLLEGE WOULD

[Captioner] 19:50:09
 ALSO -- THE WHOLE COMMUNITY THERE

[Captioner] 19:50:11
 WOULD ALSO BE IMPACTED WITH THAT CHANGE.


[Captioner] 19:50:14
IS THERE ANY BUS REROUTING ON THAT STREET?


[Captioner] 19:50:20
>> Mr. Larsen: THERE'S NOTHING AS PART OF THIS AGENDA ITEM THAT

[Captioner] 19:50:23
 WOULD CHANGE OR HAVE ANY IMPACT ON BUS SERVICE

[Captioner] 19:50:27
 OR STOP LOCATIONS OR ROUTING.


[Captioner] 19:50:31
JUST AS A SEPARATE MATTER, AC TRANSIT

[Captioner] 19:50:36
 IS IN THE MIDDLE OF A STUDY AND COMMUNITY OUTREACH

[Captioner] 19:50:40
 PROCESS TO MODERNIZE AND ADDRESS BUS

[Captioner] 19:50:43
 TRANSIT SERVICE IN THE FREMONT AREA.
AND

[Captioner] 19:50:48
 SO THROUGH THAT STUDY EFFORT WILL BE KIND OF

[Captioner] 19:50:51
 THE MECHANISM TO ADDRESS ANY CHANGES

[Captioner] 19:50:54
 IN BUS SERVICE.
SO NOTHING RELATED TO

[Captioner] 19:50:57
 BUS SERVICE IS PART OF THIS AGENDA ITEM.


[Captioner] 19:51:00

>> Vice Mayor Cox: OKAY.


[Captioner] 19:51:03
WAS OHLONE COLLEGE NOTIFIED OF THESE CHANGES THAT

[Captioner] 19:51:06
 WOULD IMPACT THE COMMUNITY SINCE IT'S WITHIN A MILE OF THE CAMPUS?


[Captioner] 19:51:09
>> Mr. Larsen: FOR THE -- KOCH COX WITH THIS

[Captioner] 19:51:13
 AGENDA ITEM.
>> Mr. Larsen: THIS DOESN'T HAVE ANY 

[Captioner] 19:51:15
IMPACT TO BUS SERVICE OR OHLONE COLLEGE.


[Captioner] 19:51:19
>> Vice Mayor Cox: OKAY.
I JUST WANTED -- JUST MAKING SURE 

[Captioner] 19:51:22
WE'RE GETTING COMMUNITY INPUT

[Captioner] 19:51:25
 SINCE IT'S WITHIN A MILE OF THE CAMPUS THERE

[Captioner] 19:51:29
.


[Captioner] 19:51:35
>> Mr. Larsen: YEAH, THE MAIN PART OF THIS ITEM

[Captioner] 19:51:38
 IS REALLY A PRIOR APPROVED DEVELOPMENT, SO THE ACTION HERE IS

[Captioner] 19:51:42
 TO IMPLEMENT CONDITIONS OF APPROVAL AS PART OF THAT DEVELOPMENT PROCESS.


[Captioner] 19:51:48
>> Vice Mayor Cox: OKAY.


[Captioner] 19:51:52
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN, I STILL NEED TO 

[Captioner] 19:51:54
OPEN THE PUBLIC HEARING BUT IS THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME?


[Captioner] 19:51:59
>> Councilmember Salwan: YEAH, QUICK QUESTION.


[Captioner] 19:52:02
I MEAN, I KNOW IT'S NOT DIRECTLY RELATED, BUT WE HAD THE

[Captioner] 19:52:05
 MISSION SAN JOSÉ STUDY, AND WE WERE IDENTIFYING ELLSWORTH AS

[Captioner] 19:52:09
 A REIMAGINING ELLSWORTH AND HOW THIS

[Captioner] 19:52:11
 COULD BE KIND OF A GATEWAY TO THAT AREA.


[Captioner] 19:52:14
DOES THIS FIT IN WITH THAT VISION THAT WE'RE TRYING TO CREATE THERE?


[Captioner] 19:52:20
>> Mr. Larsen: IF DAN IS HERE OR SOMEBODY FROM COMMUNITY

[Captioner] 19:52:23
 DEVELOPMENT.
BUT I THINK, YOU KNOW,

[Captioner] 19:52:27
 THAT -- KIND OF THE QUESTION ABOUT HOW THIS DEVELOPMENT

[Captioner] 19:52:30
 FIT INTO THAT AREA WOULD BE PART OF THE

[Captioner] 19:52:33
 PLANNING PROCESS AND THE PRIOR APPROVAL FOR THE

[Captioner] 19:52:37
 DEVELOPMENT, AND MY UNDERSTANDING IS, YOU

[Captioner] 19:52:40
 KNOW, THIS PROJECT IS CONSISTENT WITH THE CITY'S

[Captioner] 19:52:44
 GENERAL PLAN AND VISION FOR THE

[Captioner] 19:52:46
 AREA.
>> COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN, I CAN ADD ON 

[Captioner] 19:52:49
TO THAT IF YOU'D LIKE.
JUST -- THE

[Captioner] 19:52:52
 DEVELOPMENT PROJECT PROPOSED AT THAT SITE WAS ALREADY

[Captioner] 19:52:55
 CONTEMPLATED AT THE TIME THAT STUDY WAS COMPLETED, AND SO IT WAS SORT

[Captioner] 19:52:59
 OF INCORPORATED INTO THE STRATEGY

[Captioner] 19:53:02
 ABOUT WASHINGTON AND ELLSWORTH.
>> Councilmember Salwan:

[Captioner] 19:53:05
 OKAY.
>> I'D LIKE TO

[Captioner] 19:53:08
 ALSO ADD BASED ON THE STUDY, ELLSWORTH WAS IDENTIFIED AS A

[Captioner] 19:53:12
 PEDESTRIAN PARKING-ORIENTED STREET, PARALLEL

[Captioner] 19:53:14
 TO MISSION BOULEVARD, BECAUSE OF TRAFFIC CONCERNS.


[Captioner] 19:53:18
SO ON THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT, THERE WAS NO VACATION

[Captioner] 19:53:22
  ENVISIONED, OR GIVEN OR PROVIDED TO THE

[Captioner] 19:53:24
 APPLICANT OR THROUGH THE VACATION PROCESS.


[Captioner] 19:53:28
SO ENTIRE CORRIDOR OF ELLSWORTH HAS

[Captioner] 19:53:31
 BEEN PROTECTED, EVEN THOUGH IT'S ALMOST 80

[Captioner] 19:53:35
 TO 82 FEET WIDE, WE HAVEN'T VACATED ANYTHING ON

[Captioner] 19:53:38
 ELLSWORTH ON MULTIPLE PROJECTS.
>> Councilmember Salwan:

[Captioner] 19:53:39
 OKAY, GOT IT.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:53:42
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
COUNCILMEMBER KENG, DO YOU HAVE

[Captioner] 19:53:45
 A CLARIFYING QUESTION?
>> Councilmember Keng:

[Captioner] 19:53:48
 I DO, YES.
THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR, AND THANK YOU 

[Captioner] 19:53:51
FOR THIS ITEM.


[Captioner] 19:53:58
THE -- HERE DOESN'T SHOW ANY SIDEWALK.
IS THERE ANY SIDEWALK PLANNED

[Captioner] 19:54:01
 FOR THE --
>> YES, THE

[Captioner] 19:54:06
 STANDARD 11-FOOT WIDE PARKWAY WITH THE 5-FOOT SIDEWALK

[Captioner] 19:54:09
 AND PLANTER AREA IS ALSO PLANNED AFTER THE

[Captioner] 19:54:13
 VACATION.
IN ADDITION TO THE PARKING BAY ALONG 

[Captioner] 19:54:15
THE STREET.
>> Councilmember Keng: ON BOTH SIDES 

[Captioner] 19:54:17
OF THE CORNER?
>> YES.


[Captioner] 19:54:19
>> Councilmember Keng: ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:54:25
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
AND AT THIS TIME, I'D LIKE TO OPEN THE

[Captioner] 19:54:28
 PUBLIC HEARING.


[Captioner] 19:54:32
>> Mr. Quintanilla: WE HAVE NO SPEAKER CARDS TURNED IN OR HANDS RAISED ON

[Captioner] 19:54:34
 ZOOM.
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY.


[Captioner] 19:54:36
THANK YOU.
AT THIS TIME THEN, I'LL CLOSE THE 

[Captioner] 19:54:39
PUBLIC HEARING.
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN?


[Captioner] 19:54:41
>> Councilmember Salwan: MOVE APPROVAL.


[Captioner] 19:54:44
>> Vice Mayor Cox: SECOND.
>> Mayor Mei: MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER 

[Captioner] 19:54:47
SALWAN AND SECONDED BY VICE MAYOR COX.


[Captioner] 19:54:49
FOR ITEM 5A.
PLEASE VOTE.


[Captioner] 19:55:01
THE MOTION PASSES UNANIMOUSLY.

[Captioner] 19:55:04

WE'RE BRINGING

[Captioner] 19:55:58

[Captioner] 19:56:06
 CEREMONIAL FLAG DISPLAYS, AS WELL AS A

[Captioner] 19:56:09
 PROCESS OR WAY TO SELECT THESE ITEMS, SO A

[Captioner] 19:56:12
 SELECTION CRITERIA THAT IS IN YOUR REPORT, AS WELL AS

[Captioner] 19:56:16
 A POTENTIAL PROCEDURE OR MECHANISM MODEL FOR A

[Captioner] 19:56:18
 ROTATION OF THESE FIVE ITEMS PER YEAR.


[Captioner] 19:56:26
SO JUST SOME BACKGROUND.
AS YOU MAY RECALL,

[Captioner] 19:56:29
 WE'VE COME BEFORE YOU A FEW TIMES REGARDING THIS

[Captioner] 19:56:32
 ITEM.
WITH TONIGHT'S ITEM JUST RESTATING 

[Captioner] 19:56:35
THAT WE ARE DISCUSSING THE DIRECTION PROVIDED AT THE FEBRUARY 21ST

[Captioner] 19:56:38
 COUNCIL MEETING.
WHICH YOU HAD

[Captioner] 19:56:42
 DIRECTED STAFF TO

[Captioner] 19:56:45
 BRING AN ITEM BACK FOR THE ADOPTION OF FIVE SAIR

[Captioner] 19:56:49
 CEREMONIAL FLAG

[Captioner] 19:56:52
 OBSERVANCES, A SELECTION CRITERIA, AS WELL AS

[Captioner] 19:56:56
 A MODEL TO ROTATE THESE ITEMS.


[Captioner] 19:56:59
SO BASED ON OUR RESEARCH, OUR STAFF'S

[Captioner] 19:57:02
 RESEARCH, IN YOUR REPORT AS WELL, THIS SLIDE

[Captioner] 19:57:06
 DISPLAYS A POTENTIAL SELECTION CRITERIA

[Captioner] 19:57:09
 FOR CEREMONIAL FLAG OBSERVANCES, AND I'LL JUST READ SOME OF THOSE

[Captioner] 19:57:10
 OUT.
I'LL READ THOSE OUT.


[Captioner] 19:57:14
SO THE OBSERVANCE

[Captioner] 19:57:17
 OR HERITAGE MONTH IS A STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND/OR FEDERALLY

[Captioner] 19:57:21
 RECOGNIZED MONTH.
THE OBSERVANCE IS NOT EXPLICITLY 

[Captioner] 19:57:24
RELATED TO A RELIGIOUS HOLIDAY OR SPECIFIC INDIVIDUAL.


[Captioner] 19:57:27
THE OBSERVANCE IS ASSOCIATED WITH A FLAG THAT CAN BE

[Captioner] 19:57:30
 ACQUIRED BY THE CITY TO BE DISPLAYED ON THE CITY'S STANDARD

[Captioner] 19:57:34
 FLAGPOLE.
THE

[Captioner] 19:57:37
 OBSERVANCE

[Captioner] 19:57:40
'S CEREMONIAL FLAG CAN BE DISPLAYED FOR NO LESS

[Captioner] 19:57:42
 THAN FIVE DAYS AND NO MORE THAN 31 DAYS.


[Captioner] 19:57:45
THE OBSERVANCE IS ALIGN WITH THE CITY OF FREMONT'S

[Captioner] 19:57:49
 DESIGNATION AS A COMPASSIONATE CITY AND IS SUPPORTIVE OF THE

[Captioner] 19:57:52
 GOALS OF DIVERSITY, EQUITY AND INCLUSION, AND THE

[Captioner] 19:57:59
 OBSERVANCE PERIOD WILL NOT OVERLAP WITH CONFLICTING OBSERVANCES

[Captioner] 19:58:02
 IN A SINGLE CALENDAR YEAR.
IF THERE IS AN

[Captioner] 19:58:05
 OVERLAP IN OBSERVANCE PERIODS, THE COUNCIL OR CITY MANAGER WILL ORGANIZE

[Captioner] 19:58:08
 THE CALENDAR TO ALTERNATE OBSERVANCES IN

[Captioner] 19:58:11
 EACH RESPECTIVE YEAR.
IT ALSO IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT FLAG

[Captioner] 19:58:14
 DIRECTIONS FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OR LOCAL STATE GOVERNMENT

[Captioner] 19:58:17
 WILL ALWAYS TAKE PRECEDENT OVER CEREMONIAL FLAG DISPLAYS.


[Captioner] 19:58:25
SO AS PRESENTED IN YOUR REPORT, WE ARE PRESENTING TWO

[Captioner] 19:58:28
 SCHEDULING OPTION MODELS FOR YOUR REVIEW

[Captioner] 19:58:31
 IN REGARDS TO FLAG

[Captioner] 19:58:34
 DISPLAY ROTATION FOR THESE FIVE OBSERVANCES.


[Captioner] 19:58:38
FL THIS SLIDE DISPLAYS OPTION NUMB

[Captioner] 19:58:42
ER ONE, A ROTATION.
WITH THIS MODEL, THIS IS

[Captioner] 19:58:45
 TO ROTATE FIVE DIFFERENT FLAG OBSERVANCES

[Captioner] 19:58:48
 PER YEAR.


[Captioner] 19:58:54
AND THEN THE SECOND OPTION AS PRESENTED IN YOUR REPORT IS A

[Captioner] 19:58:58
 PARTIAL ROTATION.
BASED ON DIRECTION PROVIDED THIS

[Captioner] 19:59:03
 YEAR, AND PAST CITY PRACTICES WITH CEREMONIAL

[Captioner] 19:59:06
 FLAG DISPLAYS OF BLACK HISTORY MONTH AND LGBTQ

[Captioner] 19:59:09
 PRIDE MONTH, THIS OPTION PRESENTS

[Captioner] 19:59:12
 TO HAVE THOSE TWO MONTHS BE

[Captioner] 19:59:16
 OBSERVED EVERY YEAR AND THEN THE ROTATION OF THE THREE

[Captioner] 19:59:20
 ADDITIONAL CEREMONIAL FLAG DISPLAY.
SO

[Captioner] 19:59:23
 CONTINUING WITH THE FIVE OBSERVANCES PER YEAR,

[Captioner] 19:59:26
 BUT STANDARDIZING TWO OF THEM TO OCCUR

[Captioner] 19:59:29
 ANNUALLY.


[Captioner] 19:59:34
SO JUST A REITERATION OF THE RECOMMENDATION BEFORE YOU TODAY.


[Captioner] 19:59:38
WE ARE PRESENTING RECOMMENDATIONS FOR YOU

[Captioner] 19:59:42
 TO ADOPT A WAY TO HAVE THE FIVE

[Captioner] 19:59:45
 CEREMONIAL FLAG DISPLAYS PER YEAR AS WELL AS A

[Captioner] 19:59:48
 SELECTION CRITERIA, AND ASKING YOU TO

[Captioner] 19:59:51
 GIVE DIRECTION ON WHAT IS THE PROCESS

[Captioner] 19:59:55
 OR MODEL BASED ON THESE TWO SCHEDULING OPTIONS, WHICH WOULD BE

[Captioner] 19:59:59
 TO ROTATE FIVE DIFFERENT -- IN

[Captioner] 20:00:02
 OPTION ONE, FIVE DIFFERENT CEREMONIAL FLAG DISPLAYS PER

[Captioner] 20:00:05
 YEAR, OR WITH OPTION TWO, TO HAVE

[Captioner] 20:00:09
 THE TWO STANDARDIZED LGBTQ PRIDE MONTH AND

[Captioner] 20:00:12
 BLACK HISTORY MONTH WITH THE ROTATING THE THREE

[Captioner] 20:00:15
 OTHER OBSERVANCES.
OF COURSE OPEN TO YOUR

[Captioner] 20:00:19
 DIRECTION IF DIFFERENT MODELS ARE

[Captioner] 20:00:22
 PRESENTED.
SO WITH THAT, I'LL TURN

[Captioner] 20:00:25
 TO ALLEN.
>> BEFORE WE DIVE INTO YOUR QUESTIONS, 

[Captioner] 20:00:29
COUNCIL, STAFF'S INTENT IN

[Captioner] 20:00:35
 ASSEMBLING THIS SELECTION CRITERIA

[Captioner] 20:00:37
 AND SCHEDULING ROTATIONS IS

[Captioner] 20:00:41
 TO NARROW THE WORLD OF

[Captioner] 20:00:46
 POTENTIAL CEREMONIAL FLAG CONSIDERATIONS FOR

[Captioner] 20:00:49
 YOU, AND THAT'S

[Captioner] 20:00:52
 IN RESPONSE TO YOUR DIRECTION TO DEVELOP THAT CRITERIA, AND

[Captioner] 20:00:56
 IT ALSO A FUNCTION OF JUST HOW MANY

[Captioner] 20:00:59
 POTENTIAL CEREMONIAL RECOGNITIONS THERE COULD BE THAT EXIST IN

[Captioner] 20:01:03
 THE WORLD.
WE WILL, OF COURSE, TAKE YOUR 

[Captioner] 20:01:06
DIRECTION WITH REGARD TO ALL OF THIS

[Captioner] 20:01:09
 PRESENTATION, BUT STAFF'S INTENT WAS TO

[Captioner] 20:01:13
 PROVIDE DIGESTIBLE DECISIONS FOR THE KOWB

[Captioner] 20:01:16
 COUNCIL TO MAKE WITH RESPECT TO, ONE, HOW

[Captioner] 20:01:19
 MANY HOLIDAYS OR CEREMONIAL OBSERVANCES YOU

[Captioner] 20:01:21
 CONSIDERED, AND THEN TWO, HOW TO IMPLEMENT THEM.


[Captioner] 20:01:23
SO WITH THAT, WE'D BE HAPPY TO TAKE YOUR QUESTIONS.


[Captioner] 20:01:30
>> Mayor Mei: WE'LL BEGIN WITH COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN.


[Captioner] 20:01:34
YOU HAVE CLARIFYING QUESTIONS?
>> Councilmember Salwan: THAT WAS FROM

[Captioner] 20:01:37
 BEFORE, BUT I CAN, I GUESS, JUMP RIGHT

[Captioner] 20:01:40
 IN.
SO HOW DOES STAFF ARRIVE AT

[Captioner] 20:01:44
 THESE PARTICULAR, I GUESS, FLAG

[Captioner] 20:01:48
 DAYS, HOLIDAYS OR

[Captioner] 20:01:52
 COMMEMORATIVE EVENTS?


[Captioner] 20:01:56
>> Mr. DeMers: WE CONDUCTED RESEARCH INTO HOW OTHER

[Captioner] 20:02:00
 CITIES SELECT CEREMONIAL FLAGS

[Captioner] 20:02:05
 TO DISPLAY, BUT EFFECTIVELY, WE LEANED VERY

[Captioner] 20:02:08
 HEAVILY ON THE FEDERAL AND STATE OF

[Captioner] 20:02:12
 CALIFORNIA DESIGNATIONS OF CEREMONIAL

[Captioner] 20:02:16
 OR HERITAGE MONTHS.
THAT'S WHAT WE SAW SOME OTHER CITIES 

[Captioner] 20:02:21
DO AS WELL.
AND WHEN YOU APPLY THAT CRITERIA THAT

[Captioner] 20:02:24
 AMANDA TALKED THROUGH ON -- I THINK IT WAS SLIDE 2 OF

[Captioner] 20:02:27
 THE PRESENTATION, THOSE ARE

[Captioner] 20:02:31
 THE POTENTIAL OBSERVANCES THAT THE

[Captioner] 20:02:34
 CRITERIA ALLIANCE WITH.


[Captioner] 20:02:37
>> Councilmember Salwan: OKAY.
SO PART OF THE EMAILS I WAS READING 

[Captioner] 20:02:40
AND SOME OF THE FEEDBACK I'VE KIND OF GOTTEN

[Captioner] 20:02:45
 INFORMALLY HAS BEEN THAT SOME OF THE EVENTS DON'T ALIGN WITH

[Captioner] 20:02:49
 THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF THE COMMUNITY.
SO I WAS

[Captioner] 20:02:52
 WONDERING IF THERE'S A WAY TO CAPTURE SOME OF THE COMMUNITY MEMBERS, THE

[Captioner] 20:02:55
 COMMUNITIES THAT ARE REPRESENTED HERE IN FREMONT, SO

[Captioner] 20:02:58
 THAT WAY WE CAN GET MORE PEOPLE INVOLVED THAT MATCH

[Captioner] 20:03:01
 THE DIVERSITY OF FREMONT.
IS THAT SOMETHING THAT WE CAN LOOK AT,

[Captioner] 20:03:04
 FACTOR INTO HOW WE CAN GET MORE GROUPS

[Captioner] 20:03:08
 INVOLVED?
ESPECIALLY THE

[Captioner] 20:03:11
 ONES IN HIGHER PERCENTAGE HERE IN

[Captioner] 20:03:12
 FREMONT?
>> Mr. DeMers: STAFF, OF COURSE, 

[Captioner] 20:03:16
STANDS READY TO IMPLEMENT THE DIRECTION THAT YOU PROVIDE

[Captioner] 20:03:25
 COUNCIL.
THE INTENT OF OUR SELECTION CRITERIA 

[Captioner] 20:03:29
WAS TO NARROW -- AND I KNOW -- I WOULD

[Captioner] 20:03:32
 IMAGINE WE'LL HAVE SOME SPEAKERS TONIGHT ON THIS TOPIC,

[Captioner] 20:03:35
 AND CERTAINLY WELCOME THAT INPUT AS

[Captioner] 20:03:38
 WELL, BUT YOU KNOW, SOME OF THE

[Captioner] 20:03:41
 HOLIDAYS THAT I SAW PRESENTED FOR

[Captioner] 20:03:45
 CONSIDERATION WERE, YOU KNOW,

[Captioner] 20:03:49
 JUST -- THEY WEREN'T PART OF THE STATE OR FEDERALLY

[Captioner] 20:03:51
 RECOGNIZED LIST THAT WE USE TO INITIALLY NARROW DOWN WHAT WE WOULD 

[Captioner] 20:03:54
PRESENT TO YOU.
SO WE DID NOT INCLUDE THOSE FOR 

[Captioner] 20:03:57
CONSIDERATION THIS EVENING.
>> Councilmember Salwan: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:03:59
I'LL WAIT FOR PUBLIC TESTIMONY AND WE CAN CIRCLE BACK.


[Captioner] 20:04:01
THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:04:03
NEXT IS VICE MAYOR COX.
CLARIFYING QUESTIONS.


[Captioner] 20:04:09
>> Vice Mayor Cox: YES.
I WOULD FIRST LIKE

[Captioner] 20:04:12
 TO -- I WOULD LIKE

[Captioner] 20:04:16
 TO FIRST HEAR FROM THE PUBLIC COMMENTS AND THEN MAKE MY COMMENTS

[Captioner] 20:04:19
 AND CLARIFICATIONS.
>> Mayor

[Captioner] 20:04:22
 Mei: OKAY.
AT THIS TIME,

[Captioner] 20:04:25
 I'LL OPEN THE PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD.
AND SO MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC

[Captioner] 20:04:28
 WISHING TO ADDRESS THIS ITEM, WHICH IS THE CEREMONIAL

[Captioner] 20:04:32
 FLAG DISPLAY, MAY DO SO BY CLICKING ON THE RAISE

[Captioner] 20:04:35
 HAND ICON IF YOU'RE ON ZOOM OR IF DIALING IN, BY

[Captioner] 20:04:40
 DIALING STAR NINE, AND IF THERE ARE SPEAKERS HERE, IF WE COULD CALL

[Captioner] 20:04:43
 THOSE SPEAKERS.
>> Mr. Quintanilla: YES, WE HAVE EIGHT 

[Captioner] 20:04:44
SPEAKER CARDS, CURRENTLY ONE HAND RAISED ON ZOOM.


[Captioner] 20:04:48
OUR FIRST SPEAKER IS ALEX WU.
THAT WILL BE

[Captioner] 20:04:52
 FOLLOWED BY DR. RAMESH

[Captioner] 20:04:52
 JOPRA.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:05:06
>> GOOD EVENING, MAYOR MEI,

[Captioner] 20:05:12
 COUNCIL, STAFF, AND FREMONT PUBLIC.
THIS IS ABOUT THE

[Captioner] 20:05:16
 FLAG DISPLAY.
WHEN I

[Captioner] 20:05:19
 READ THAT

[Captioner] 20:05:25
 ROTATION, I WAS SURPRISED THAT

[Captioner] 20:05:28
 DIWALI AND LUNAR NEW YEAR WERE NOT ON THE LIST TO BE

[Captioner] 20:05:32
 CONSIDERED.


[Captioner] 20:05:36
SO JUST LIKE COUNCILMEMBER

[Captioner] 20:05:39
 SALWAN MENTIONED, CITY

[Captioner] 20:05:42
 OF FREMONT HAD OVER

[Captioner] 20:05:46
 70% POPULATION OF ASIAN.
AND THIS SHOULD

[Captioner] 20:05:49
 NOT BE NEGLECTED.
ON THE OTHER

[Captioner] 20:05:53
 HAND,

[Captioner] 20:05:57
 BOTH THE DIWALI AND LUNAR NEW

[Captioner] 20:06:00
 YEAR ARE WIDE

[Captioner] 20:06:04
LY CELEBRATED WITHIN THE CITY.
JUST AS YOU HAVE MENTIONED ABOUT

[Captioner] 20:06:08
 CONSIDERING

[Captioner] 20:06:11
 SOME OF THE

[Captioner] 20:06:14
 HOLIDAY THAT STATE AND FEDERAL ARE

[Captioner] 20:06:17
 USING, I GUESS YOU

[Captioner] 20:06:21
 RECOGNIZE GOVERNOR NEWSOM

[Captioner] 20:06:25
 HAD ANNOUNCED

[Captioner] 20:06:28
 LUNAR NEW YEAR AS A HOLIDAY FOR CALIFORNIA.


[Captioner] 20:06:32
FOR WHAT REASON?
MAINLY HE HAD STATED TO ACKNOWLEDGE

[Captioner] 20:06:36
 THE DIVERSITY AND

[Captioner] 20:06:39
 THE CULTURAL SIGNIFICANCE

[Captioner] 20:06:42
 THAT THE ASIAN AMERICANS HAVE BROUGHT TO CALIFORNIA.


[Captioner] 20:06:47
SO PLEASE CONSIDER

[Captioner] 20:06:51
 THIS AS MAYOR -- I MEAN

[Captioner] 20:06:54
 GOVERNOR NEWSOM HAVE MENTIONED.


[Captioner] 20:06:57
BY THE WAY, LUNAR NEW YEAR

[Captioner] 20:07:01
 IS CELEBRATED BY A HANDFUL

[Captioner] 20:07:05
 OF ASIAN COUNTRIES.
IF WE

[Captioner] 20:07:08
 ULTIMATELY ELECT TO CELEBRATE LUNAR NEW YEAR, IT SHOULD

[Captioner] 20:07:12
 NOT BE A FLAG OF CERTAIN COUNTRY.
IT

[Captioner] 20:07:15
 SHOULD BE

[Captioner] 20:07:19
 OF MULTIPLE COUNTRIES.
THAT'S

[Captioner] 20:07:23
 MY SUGGESTION.

[Captioner] 20:07:26
 -- THAT'S MY LONE SUGGESTION.
THANK YOU, EVERYONE.


[Captioner] 20:07:29
[APPLAUSE]
>> Mr. Quintanilla: OUR NEXT SPEAKER 

[Captioner] 20:07:33
IS DR. RAMESH JOPRA FOLLOWED BY

[Captioner] 20:07:37
 RAJESH.
>> GOOD EVENING, MAYOR,

[Captioner] 20:07:42
 COUNCILMEMBERS, STAFF AND CITIZENS OF

[Captioner] 20:07:45
 FREMONT.
MY NAME IS RAMESH

[Captioner] 20:07:49
 JAPRA.
AND I STAND HERE IN

[Captioner] 20:07:52
 FRONT OF YOU ALL TO HAVE

[Captioner] 20:07:55
 MY OBJECTION TO WHAT HAS BEEN PROPOSED

[Captioner] 20:08:00
 HERE, LIKE ALEX MENTIONED EARLIER, IT'S BEEN A TOTAL

[Captioner] 20:08:03
 SURPRISE TO MANY OF US AFTER SEEING

[Captioner] 20:08:06
 THIS LIST, AND THE SELECTION CRITERIA

[Captioner] 20:08:10
, WHICH HAS BEEN

[Captioner] 20:08:14
 PROPOSED, IT SHOULD BE FOR THE RESIDENTS OF CITY OF

[Captioner] 20:08:17
 FREMONT, AND

[Captioner] 20:08:21
 DEMOGRAPHICS LIKE OUR COUNCILMEMBER DR. RAJ

[Captioner] 20:08:24
 SALWAN MENTIONED SHOULD BE CONSIDERED

[Captioner] 20:08:27
 HEAVILY

[Captioner] 20:08:31
 WHILE RESEARCHING VIRTUALLY AND TRYING TO BRING SOME OF THE NAMES WHICH DO

[Captioner] 20:08:34
 NOT REPRESENT THE CITY OF

[Captioner] 20:08:37
 FREMONT AS HINDU AMERICAN HERITAGE MONTH HAS

[Captioner] 20:08:40
 BEEN CELEBRATED, HAS BEEN

[Captioner] 20:08:44
 COMMEMORATED SINCE 2013 AT THE STATE

[Captioner] 20:08:47
 LEVEL, ANNUALLY, AND EVEN IN THE CITY OF

[Captioner] 20:08:50
 FREMONT, HINDU HERITAGE MONTH HAS BEEN

[Captioner] 20:08:54
 COMMEMORATED MANY, MANY

[Captioner] 20:08:57
 TIMES.
THE MAYOR HAS GIVEN

[Captioner] 20:09:00
 PROCLAMATIONS ON THIS, AND THE

[Captioner] 20:09:04
 CITY, EVEN AS OUR DIWALI

[Captioner] 20:09:07
, GANDHI'S BIRTHDAY, OTHER

[Captioner] 20:09:10
 HOLIDAYS, MANY, MANY OTHER HOLIDAY THE FALL IN THE MONTH OF

[Captioner] 20:09:14
 OCTOBER AND HAS BEEN CELEBRATING THIS MONTH OF

[Captioner] 20:09:17
 OCTOBER

[Captioner] 20:09:22
.
IT'S BEEN CELEBRATED AT A

[Captioner] 20:09:25
 STATE LEVEL EVERY YEAR, EVEN THOUGH IT'S NOT A RELIGION, IF YOU WANT

[Captioner] 20:09:29
 TO CONSIDER THAT AS AN ETHNIC COMMUNITY OR AS A RACE

[Captioner] 20:09:32
 OR AS A COMMUNITY AT LARGE, WHEN THE JEWISH AMERICAN

[Captioner] 20:09:35
 HERITAGE MONTH CAN BE CELEBRATED, OR

[Captioner] 20:09:37
 ARAB-AMERICAN, NOTHING AGAINST ANY ONE OF THOSE.


[Captioner] 20:09:40
WHAT I'M SAYING IS, THEY COULD FALL INTO THE SAME

[Captioner] 20:09:43
 CATEGORIES AS THE HINDU AMERICAN HERITAGE.


[Captioner] 20:09:46
SO WE ARE VERY, VERY PROUD OF OUR HERITAGE, WE

[Captioner] 20:09:49
 HAVE CONTRIBUTED A LOT TO THE CITY OF FREMONT, TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA, 

[Captioner] 20:09:53
AND TO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.
AND WE

[Captioner] 20:09:56
 WOULD CONTINUE DOING THAT.
OUR VALUES

[Captioner] 20:09:59
 ARE ALIGNED WITH THE

[Captioner] 20:10:03
 CONSTITUTION OF AMERICA, AS WELL AS

[Captioner] 20:10:06
 SOME OF THE THINGS MENTIONED HERE, DIVERSITY, EQUITY AND

[Captioner] 20:10:10
 INCLUSION, AND WE'LL CONTINUE DOING THAT, SO WE WOULD

[Captioner] 20:10:13
 RECOMMEND THAT OUR COMMUNITY SHOULD BE REPRESENTED AND

[Captioner] 20:10:16
 HINDU HERITAGE, HINDU AMERICAN HERITAGE MONTH SHOULD BE INCLUDED

[Captioner] 20:10:19
 IN THIS LIST OVER HERE.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:10:24
[APPLAUSE]
>> Mr. Quintanilla: OUR NEXT SPEAKER 

[Captioner] 20:10:28
IS RAJES

[Captioner] 20:10:31
H VERMA.
>> GOOD EVENING, HONORABLE

[Captioner] 20:10:34
 MAYOR, PERSONS, CITY STAFF AND ALL THE PUBLIC OVER HERE FROM THE CITY OF

[Captioner] 20:10:38
 FREMONT.
JUST

[Captioner] 20:10:41
 LIKE ALEX AND DR. JOB RAH SAID

[Captioner] 20:10:44
 AND ALSO -- SAID THAT I'M ALSO

[Captioner] 20:10:48
 TALKING ABOUT THE HINDU HERITAGE MONTH, AS WELL AS THE

[Captioner] 20:10:51
 DIWALI, AS WELL AS THE LUNAR, YOU KNOW, NEW YEAR

[Captioner] 20:10:55
 CELEBRATION, WHICH INCLUDES ALL THE INDIANS,

[Captioner] 20:10:58
 THE CHINESE AND AS ONE OF THE SPEAKERS

[Captioner] 20:11:01
 SAID, THERE'S 70% OF THE POPULATION IN FREMONT IS

[Captioner] 20:11:04
 FAR EAST ASIAN, YOU KNOW, SO THE CRITERIA

[Captioner] 20:11:07
 THAT THE STAFF USED BY

[Captioner] 20:11:11
 SAYING THAT STATE AND FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED

[Captioner] 20:11:14
 FLAGS AND MONTHS WILL BE USED IS NOT

[Captioner] 20:11:18
 REALLY APPLICABLE

[Captioner] 20:11:21
 CORRECTLY FOR

[Captioner] 20:11:24
 THIS SELECTION

[Captioner] 20:11:28
 IN FREMONT.
SO BESIDES THE MAYOR AND

[Captioner] 20:11:31
 ALL YOU COUNCILPERSONS YOU HAVE BEEN

[Captioner] 20:11:34
 WITH US THROUGH FESTIVAL OF LIGHT,

[Captioner] 20:11:37
 COMING TO OUR TEMPLES AND ALL THE EVENTS, AND YOU HAVE

[Captioner] 20:11:40
 SEEN THAT WE ENCOMPASS NOT ONLY ALL

[Captioner] 20:11:43
 THE HINDUS BUT WE INCLUDE

[Captioner] 20:11:47
 EVERYBODY, THE WHOLE WORLD IS ONE FAMILY AND

[Captioner] 20:11:50
 ALL PRAYERS, WE WISH TO THE

[Captioner] 20:11:54
 WHOLE OF WORLD IS HAPPY.
SO I WOULD

[Captioner] 20:11:57
 ALSO REQUEST THAT

[Captioner] 20:12:00
 STAFF HAS GUIDANCE FROM ALL OF YOU HONORABLE MAYOR

[Captioner] 20:12:03
 AND COUNCILPERSONS TO THE STAFF, THAT THEY SHOULD GO BACK AND

[Captioner] 20:12:07
 INCLUDE THESE AS WELL AS ANYTHING ELSE THAT THEY HAVE ADDED,

[Captioner] 20:12:11
 I'M NOT OBJECTING TO THAT, BUT I WANT THAT

[Captioner] 20:12:15
 SOMEHOW SHOULD BE CONSIDERED BECAUSE THIS REPRESENTS A LARGE COMMUNITY

[Captioner] 20:12:18
 AND THIS WILL BE A GOOD THING FOR

[Captioner] 20:12:22
 OUR -- TO SHOW TOO.
OTHERWISE IT LOOKS SO BAD

[Captioner] 20:12:26
 WHEN THE KIDS -- POPULATION HERE AND

[Captioner] 20:12:29
 HOW COME WE DON'T -- WE TELL THEM

[Captioner] 20:12:32

[Captioner] 20:12:36
 THE VICTORY OF

[Captioner] 20:12:40
 -- GOOD OVER

[Captioner] 20:12:44
 EVIL AND VALUES, SO I THINK IT WOULD BE

[Captioner] 20:12:47
 VERY PRUDENT IF CITY STAFF COMES BACK WITH YOUR GUIDANCE TO INCLUDE

[Captioner] 20:12:50
 THESE ALSO IN THIS

[Captioner] 20:12:51

I'M A RESIDENT OF ARDENWOOD OUT HERE IN FREMONT.


[Captioner] 20:13:15
WHEN I CAME HERE TODAY, I HEARD ABOUT THIS

[Captioner] 20:13:19
 AGENDA ITEM, I WAS REMINDED OF EARLY

[Captioner] 20:13:22
 FEBRUARY, WHEN COMMUNITY IN LARGE NUMBERS CAME HERE

[Captioner] 20:13:26
 TO REPRESENT TO REQUEST THIS, AND I'M GLAD THAT COUNCIL

[Captioner] 20:13:28
 ACTUALLY TAKES ACTION AND WORKS ON THAT.


[Captioner] 20:13:31
BUT WHEN I WENT -- I WAS

[Captioner] 20:13:35
 REALLY PUZZLED AND DISAPPOINTED.
THIS IS NOT

[Captioner] 20:13:38
 SOMETHING THAT REPRESENTS FREMONT.
THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT ANYBODY

[Captioner] 20:13:41
 WHO KNOWS FREMONT WOULD BE OKAY WITH.


[Captioner] 20:13:44
SO FOR EXAMPLE, WE DON'T

[Captioner] 20:13:48
 HAVE -- SOME EARLIER SPEAKERS HAVE SAID LIKE 60, 70%

[Captioner] 20:13:51
 OF OUR FREMONT COMMUNITY IS ASIAN COMMUNITY,

[Captioner] 20:13:55
 AND WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING IN THE LIST REPRESENTING

[Captioner] 20:13:58
 THAT, WHICH IS NOT ACCEPTABLE.
LAST YEAR ACTUALLY

[Captioner] 20:14:02
 FREMONT CITY COUNCIL DECLARED OCTOBER

[Captioner] 20:14:07
 AS HINDU -- WE ARE GOING

[Captioner] 20:14:11
 BACK, WE ALREADY CELEBRATED

[Captioner] 20:14:14
 -- NOW WE ARE SAYING BECAUSE FEDERAL OR STATE DOESN'T SAY

[Captioner] 20:14:17
 SOMETHING, WE'LL NOT DO IT.
SO WE COULD HAVE COME UP WITH THIS 

[Captioner] 20:14:20
KIND OF CRITERIA AND

[Captioner] 20:14:23
 THE LIST IN TWO MINUTES.
WE DIDN'T NEED TO HAVE SIX MONTHS TO 

[Captioner] 20:14:25
GO THROUGH THAT.
SO THAT'S SOMETHING WHICH IS NOT 

[Captioner] 20:14:29
REALLY NICE.
AND CRITERIA SELECTION DOES NOT TAKE 

[Captioner] 20:14:32
INTO ACCOUNT OUR UNIQUE CULTURE, HERITAGE,

[Captioner] 20:14:36
 DEMOGRAPHICS.
ONE OF THOSE

[Captioner] 20:14:39
 ITEMS, QUICKLY

[Captioner] 20:14:42
 INCLUSION IS THERE.
BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE LOCAL LEVEL, 

[Captioner] 20:14:45
NONE OF THAT IS INCLUDED IN THE LIST

[Captioner] 20:14:49
 THAT HAS BEEN MADE UP, THE

[Captioner] 20:14:52
 CRITERIA LISTED OUT THERE.
IF 60,

[Captioner] 20:14:56
 70% OF THE COMMUNITY IS INDIAN ASIAN AND YOU DO NOT INCLUDE THEM,

[Captioner] 20:14:58
 THEN THAT'S NOT REALLY A CEREMONIAL CELEBRATION OF ANYTHING.


[Captioner] 20:15:02
SO WE DEFINITELY NEED TO THAT AND

[Captioner] 20:15:05
 AS COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN SAID, WE SHOULD HAVE

[Captioner] 20:15:08
 INPUT FROM COMMUNITY, WE SHOULD

[Captioner] 20:15:13
 HELP US SAY AS TO WHAT WE CELEBRATE.
THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT'S

[Captioner] 20:15:15
 KIND OF ON THE FRINGE OR SOMETHING VERY UNIQUE.


[Captioner] 20:15:19
 UNIQUE WE ARE REQUESTING, SO

[Captioner] 20:15:23
 I WOULD

[Captioner] 20:15:26
  EVERYBODY -- INCLUDE

[Captioner] 20:15:28
 DIWALI AS WELL AS LUNAR DAYS.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:15:32
[APPLAUSE]
>> Mr. Quintanilla: OUR NEXT SPEAKER 

[Captioner] 20:15:37
IS SHONDRU FOLLOWED BY GOVIN.


[Captioner] 20:15:43
>> GOOD EVENING, MERRILL OF FREMONT

[Captioner] 20:15:46
 AND COUNCILMEMBERS FOR FREMONT AND PUBLIC OF FREMONT

[Captioner] 20:15:49
 PRESENT HERE.


[Captioner] 20:15:53
I WAS JUST LISTENING TO

[Captioner] 20:15:57
 THOSE SYSTEM OF HOW THEY

[Captioner] 20:16:00
 HAVE DECIDED THE LIST, AND I WAS REALLY

[Captioner] 20:16:04
 SURPRISED THAT WHEN --

[Captioner] 20:16:08
 WITH 70% -- MORE THAN

[Captioner] 20:16:11
 70% POPULATION OF FAR EAST

[Captioner] 20:16:14
 ASIANS AND INDIANS, YOU CANNOT

[Captioner] 20:16:17
 FIND THAT LIST, THAT

[Captioner] 20:16:21
 NAME IN THE LIST?
I WOULD LIKE TO

[Captioner] 20:16:24
 REQUEST THE PEOPLE WHO MADE LIST TO

[Captioner] 20:16:27
 PUBLICIZE THE METHOD IN WHICH THEY CALCULATED AND DECIDED

[Captioner] 20:16:30
 THIS LIST.
THIS LIST SHOULD BE MATTER OF

[Captioner] 20:16:32
 PREPARING THE LIST SHOULD BE PUBLICIZE PUBLICLY.


[Captioner] 20:16:36
THIS IS

[Captioner] 20:16:39
 NOT OFFENSIVE TO US AT ALL.
SO YOU HAVE TO GIVE SOME

[Captioner] 20:16:42
 REASONING AND SOME CONSIDERATION TO THE

[Captioner] 20:16:45
 POPULATION ALSO.
WE HAVE BEEN CELEBRATING

[Captioner] 20:16:48
 THESE FESTIVALS FOR SO MANY YEARS IN

[Captioner] 20:16:52
 LARGE NUMBERS.
SO PLEASE, ALL THE

[Captioner] 20:16:55
 COUNCILMEMBERS, MAYOR, THEY

[Captioner] 20:16:59
 SHOULD REVISE THIS LIST AND ASK THESE PEOPLE WHO

[Captioner] 20:17:02
 HAVE PREPARED THE LIST TO GIVE US ALL THE REASONS

[Captioner] 20:17:05
 AND LOGIC BEHIND THE LIST.
THIS DOESN'T SEEM

[Captioner] 20:17:06
 LOGICAL.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:17:10
[APPLAUSE]


[Captioner] 20:17:13
>> Mr. Quintanilla: OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS

[Captioner] 20:17:17
 COVIN FOLLOWED BY MARTY.
>>

[Captioner] 20:17:21
 GOOD EVENING, HONORABLE MAYOR, COUNCILMEMBERS AND THE PUBLIC OF CITY

[Captioner] 20:17:24
 OF FREMONT.
HINDU

[Captioner] 20:17:27
 AMERICANS, THE DENSITY OF POPULATION OF HINDU AMERICANS IS

[Captioner] 20:17:30
 THE MAXIMUM IN THE CITY OF FREMONT COMPARED TO

[Captioner] 20:17:33
 THE ENTIRE UNITED STATES.


[Captioner] 20:17:37
SO IT IS SAD THAT THIS COMMUNITY IS NOT BEING

[Captioner] 20:17:40
 REPRESENTED IN

[Captioner] 20:17:43
  THIS --

[Captioner] 20:17:46
 EVEN -- SO HINDU AMERICANS COME FROM

[Captioner] 20:17:50
 CENTURIES-OLD TRADITIONS.
SO THEY'RE BRING

[Captioner] 20:17:54
ING AN ENRICHED CULTURE AND TRADITION TO THE

[Captioner] 20:17:58
 MAIN GLOBAL COMMUNITY, WHICH

[Captioner] 20:18:01
 PREACHES UNIVERSAL PEACE AND INTEGRATION.


[Captioner] 20:18:04
SO THE EVENT SUCH AS DIWALI,

[Captioner] 20:18:08
 THEY REPRESENT

[Captioner] 20:18:13
 VICTORY, GOOD OVER EVIL, AND DISPELLING

[Captioner] 20:18:15
 DARKNESS FROM EVERYONE'S LIVES AND GIVING BACK TO THE COMMUNITY.


[Captioner] 20:18:19
SO IT ONLY PREACHES

[Captioner] 20:18:23
 INCLUSIVENESS AND EXTENSION OF THE SPIRITUAL WEALTH OF

[Captioner] 20:18:26
 THE ANCIENT CIVILIZATION THAT EXISTS ON THIS PLANET

[Captioner] 20:18:29
 EARTH.
AND SO IT IS ONLY APPROPRIATE

[Captioner] 20:18:33
 THAT THIS COMMUNITY IS INCLUDED IN THIS EVENING, AND IT

[Captioner] 20:18:36
 VERY WELL FALLS INTO THE CRITERIA THAT

[Captioner] 20:18:39
 STAFF MEMBERS HAVE COME UP WITH.
IT'S NOT JUST A RELIGIOUS

[Captioner] 20:18:40
 HOLIDAY.
IT IS BEYOND RELIGION.


[Captioner] 20:18:44
SO

[Captioner] 20:18:48
 THEY PROMOTE FOR UNIVERSAL GOOD.
PREACH HOW ONE CAN

[Captioner] 20:18:51
 BE A GOOD CITIZEN, AND HOPE

[Captioner] 20:18:55
 THE COMMUNITY CAN COME TOGETHER, SO THERE'S VERY

[Captioner] 20:18:58
 MUCH A NEED, PEOPLE DO NOT KNOW WHO THEIR NEIGHBORS ARE,

[Captioner] 20:19:01
 SO THAT'S A BAD SITUATION WHICH WE ALL LIVE IN THIS COUNTRY

[Captioner] 20:19:04
 IN PARTICULAR.
SO EVENTS LIKE

[Captioner] 20:19:07
 DIWALI AND OTHER ACTIVITIES OR

[Captioner] 20:19:10
 FESTIVITIES THAT THIS HINDU AMERICAN COMMUNITY WILL BRING FORTH TO THE

[Captioner] 20:19:13
 MAIN PLATFORM WILL BE VERY INCLUSIVE OF THE ENTIRE

[Captioner] 20:19:17
 COMMUNITY, WHERE WE EXCHANGE GIFTS

[Captioner] 20:19:21
 WITH THE ENTIRE -- YOU KNOW, YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD,

[Captioner] 20:19:24
 AND YOU GO BEYOND THESE COMMUNITIES TO GO OUT AND

[Captioner] 20:19:27
 HELP THE UNDER PRIVILEGED

[Captioner] 20:19:30
 PEOPLE DURING THESE TIMES, WHERE THE RELIGION

[Captioner] 20:19:33
 ASPECT OF IT IS TO

[Captioner] 20:19:37
 ENCOURAGE THE -- TO GIVE BACK TO THE LESS

[Captioner] 20:19:39
 PRIVILEGED.
SO THAT IS THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS 

[Captioner] 20:19:43
EVENING, AND TO DISPEL PEOPLE AND

[Captioner] 20:19:46
 TO UNITE

[Captioner] 20:19:48
 -- TO BRING DIVERSE COMMUNITIES TOGETHER.


[Captioner] 20:19:52
IT SHOULD BE A BOTTOM APPROACH, NOT A

[Captioner] 20:19:55
 TOP-DOWN COMING FROM THE

[Captioner] 20:19:58
 FEDERAL -- IF YOU START ON THE CITY LEVEL AND GO

[Captioner] 20:20:02
 UPWARDS

[Captioner] 20:20:06
 -- SO HINDU AMERICAN COMMUNITY BEING A SUBSTANTIAL

[Captioner] 20:20:10
 POPULATION OF CITY OF FREMONT, I REQUEST YOU TO

[Captioner] 20:20:12
 PLEASE CONSIDER HINDU HERITAGE MONTH AS WELL AS DIWALI.


[Captioner] 20:20:13
THANK YOU.
[APPLAUSE]


[Captioner] 20:20:20
>> Mr. Quintanilla: OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS MARTY

[Captioner] 20:20:23
 FOLLOWED BY BEN YEE.


[Captioner] 20:20:29
>> GOOD EVENING, MADAME MAYOR, MADAM VICE MAYOR,

[Captioner] 20:20:33
 COUNCILMEMBERS CAMPBELL, KASSAN, KENG AND COX -- EXCUSE

[Captioner] 20:20:36
 ME -- AND SALWAN.
MY NAME

[Captioner] 20:20:39
 IS MARTY, I'M A RESIDENT OF NILES, A GRADUATE OF

[Captioner] 20:20:44
 IRVINGTON HIGH SCHOOL, GO VIKINGS,

[Captioner] 20:20:45
 AND I'M ALSO THE CURRENT CHAIR OF THIS CITY'S HUMAN RELATIONS COMMISSION.


[Captioner] 20:20:48
I'M HERE TO MAKE A REQUEST OF THIS COUNCIL.


[Captioner] 20:20:52
PLEASE REFER THIS ITEM TO THE HUMAN RELATIONS COMMISSION AND ALLOW

[Captioner] 20:20:55
 THE HRC TO DO WHAT YOU HAVE APPOINTED US TO

[Captioner] 20:20:58
 DO.
THIS WERE ITEM MORE THAN MANY OTHERS 

[Captioner] 20:21:01
THAT HAVE RECENTLY BEEN SEEN ON A COUNCIL AGENDA

[Captioner] 20:21:04
 PLACE PERFECTLY INTO OUR ROLE WITHIN THE CITY'S

[Captioner] 20:21:08
 GOVERNMENT.
MY ARGUMENT IS

[Captioner] 20:21:11
 EASILY SUMMARIZED THROUGH THE COMMISSION'S

[Captioner] 20:21:15
 COMMISSION STRIVES TO PREVENT DISCRIMINATION AND ENSURE THAT

[Captioner] 20:21:19
 THE RIGHTS OF ALL INDIVIDUALS AND GROUPS IN FREMONT ARE PROTECTED

[Captioner] 20:21:22
 UNDER THE LAW.
THE HRC PROMOTES,

[Captioner] 20:21:25
 SUPPORTS, AND HELPS CREATE A COMPASSIONATE COMMUNITY

[Captioner] 20:21:28
 ENVIRONMENT.
WHERE DIVERSITY IS HONORED AND 

[Captioner] 20:21:32
RESPECTED, NEIGHBORS REACH OUT AND SUPPORT EACH OTHER, AND THE MOST

[Captioner] 20:21:35
 VULNERABLE RECEIVE SERVICES, TO ALLOW ALL A

[Captioner] 20:21:39
 HIGH QUALITY OF LIFE IN A COMMUNITY WHERE WE LIVE,

[Captioner] 20:21:40
 LEARN, WORK AND PLAY IN PEACE AND HARMONY.


[Captioner] 20:21:44
SO I THINK I'VE MADE MY STATEMENT HERE.


[Captioner] 20:21:47
I THINK THAT YOU'VE GIVEN US A JOB TO DO.


[Captioner] 20:21:50
WE CAN PROVIDE YOU WITH SLEPT

[Captioner] 20:21:54
 EXCELLENT SUPPORT ON THIS ITEM, SO THAT IS

[Captioner] 20:21:57
 MY ASK OF YOU.
I HAVE ONE FINAL THING I'D LIKE TO ADD 

[Captioner] 20:22:00
ON TO MY COMMENT HERE.
THE STATE OF LIVING ON HOUSED

[Captioner] 20:22:04
 COMMONLY BUT ENACT RATTILY REFERRED TO AS HOMELESS IS NOT A CRIME, LIVING

[Captioner] 20:22:07
 IN POVERTY IS NOT A CRIME.
AND IT IS MY HOPE THAT ANYONE

[Captioner] 20:22:10
 WHO ENGAGES IN JUST COURSE ON THESE TOPICS PROVIDES

[Captioner] 20:22:13
 DIGNITY TO THOSE YEARNING FOR SURVIVAL RATHER THAN SHAMING THEM

[Captioner] 20:22:15
 THROUGH THEIR UNKIND CHOICE OF LANGUAGE.


[Captioner] 20:22:19
BE KIND AND PLEASE TREAT YOUR NEIGHBORS,

[Captioner] 20:22:23
 BOTH NEAR AND FAR FROM YOU, WITH COMPASSION.


[Captioner] 20:22:26
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
>> Mr. Quintanilla: OUR NEXT SPEAKER

[Captioner] 20:22:29
 IS BEN YEE FOLLOWED BY JOHN HINDS.


[Captioner] 20:22:36
>> GOOD EVENING, MAYOR AND MEMBERS OF THE CITY COUNCIL AND STAFF AS WELL.


[Captioner] 20:22:39
I THINK YOU ALL KNOW WHO I AM, BEN

[Captioner] 20:22:42
 YEE.
I'M HERE AS YOU KNOW, I'M ONE OF

[Captioner] 20:22:46
 YOUR PLANNING COMMISSIONERS AND ALSO STATE-LEVEL REPRESENTATIVE FOR ALL

[Captioner] 20:22:50
 THE PLANNING COMMISSIONERS IN NORTHERN CAL, BUT I COME HERE AS A

[Captioner] 20:22:53
 PRIVATE CITIZEN.
I WAS ASKED BY THE COMMUNITY

[Captioner] 20:22:56
 TO COME HERE AND SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF HAVING

[Captioner] 20:22:59
 BOTH DIWALI AND LUNAR NEW YEAR INCLUDED ON

[Captioner] 20:23:03
 TO THAT LIST.
AS WE ALL KNOW,

[Captioner] 20:23:07
 LUNAR NEW YEAR ALREADY HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED BY THE STATE,

[Captioner] 20:23:10
 AND WE ALREADY KNOW HERE IN CITY COUNCIL THAT THE MEMBERS OF

[Captioner] 20:23:13
 THE INDIAN COMMUNITY HAVE COME HERE NUMEROUS TIMES

[Captioner] 20:23:16
 TO INCLUDE DIWALI.
YOU'VE HEARD

[Captioner] 20:23:19
 THAT WORD SEVERAL TIMES, IF NOT MANY TIMES.


[Captioner] 20:23:22
SO I WOULD LIKE TO RECOMMEND THAT YOU ALSO

[Captioner] 20:23:25
 INCLUDE THOSE TWO DATE AS WELL.
THE ONE THING

[Captioner] 20:23:28
 THAT I DO

[Captioner] 20:23:32
 KNOW, BEING AN APPOINTED PERSON

[Captioner] 20:23:35
 AND WORKING WITH ALL OF YOU AS THE ELECTED

[Captioner] 20:23:37
 OFFICIALS, IS LOOKING AT A STAFF REPORT.


[Captioner] 20:23:41
THAT'S WHERE YOU BEGIN.
AND WE REACH

[Captioner] 20:23:44
 OUT TO THE COMMUNITY TO FIND OUT

[Captioner] 20:23:47
 EXACTLY WHAT ALL OF THEM NEED, SO THAT'S WHAT I

[Captioner] 20:23:51
 DO, IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE WE DO THE RIGHT THING

[Captioner] 20:23:53
 AND MAKE RIGHT DECISIONS FOR THE COMMUNITY.


[Captioner] 20:23:56
BECAUSE THE THING I'M REALLY MOST SURPRISED TO SEE IS THE LACK OF

[Captioner] 20:23:59
 THESE TWO ITEMS, BECAUSE ONE OF THE THINGS I KNOW WHEN I WAS SPEAKING WITH 

[Captioner] 20:24:02
ONE OF THE OTHER COUNCILMEMBERS IS THE LACK OF ASIAN REPRESENTATION

[Captioner] 20:24:06
 IN OUR 17 DEPARTMENTS, AND ALL OF OUR CITY

[Captioner] 20:24:10
 HERE, IF YOU TAKE A LOOK, WE DON'T HAVE

[Captioner] 20:24:13
 ANY ASIAN REPRESENTATION IN OUR SENIOR MANAGEMENT, EVEN THE

[Captioner] 20:24:17
 FIRST TWO LEVELS, AND I JUST DON'T WANT

[Captioner] 20:24:20
 TO SEE THAT THESE TWO ITEMS THAT ARE NOT ON THIS LIST

[Captioner] 20:24:24
 BECOMES SOMETHING THAT

[Captioner] 20:24:27
'S -- WHAT I'M BEING TOLD BY THE COMMUNITY IS, IT'S ANTI-ASIAN.


[Captioner] 20:24:31
SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU REALIZE, WE NEED TO HAVE

[Captioner] 20:24:34
 THOSE TWO ITEMS ON THERE, BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO

[Captioner] 20:24:37
 PERPETUATE THIS PERCEPTION OF BEING ANTI-ASIAN.


[Captioner] 20:24:38
THANK YOU.
[APPLAUSE]


[Captioner] 20:24:44
>> Mr. Quintanilla: JOHN HINDS.


[Captioner] 20:24:51
>> HELLO, EVERYONE.
A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO, THERE

[Captioner] 20:24:55
 WERE PROPOSALS TO RECOGNIZE DIWALI AND

[Captioner] 20:24:58
 LUNAR NEW YEAR WITH FULL

[Captioner] 20:25:01
 PAID HOLIDAYS FOR CITY STAFF.
AND I SPOKE

[Captioner] 20:25:04
 AGAINST THOSE TWO SUGGESTIONS FOR TWO REASONS.


[Captioner] 20:25:08
THE FIRST WAS COST.
THERE ARE ONLY

[Captioner] 20:25:11
 ABOUT 250 WORK DAYS IN A YEAR, AND WHEN YOU TAKE ONE OF THOSE

[Captioner] 20:25:15
 AWAY, YOU'VE GOT 249, 248,

[Captioner] 20:25:17
 AND PRETTY SOON YOU HAVE TO HIRE MORE STAFF TO GET THINGS DONE.


[Captioner] 20:25:23
THE SECOND REGION WAS THAT WHEN YOU

[Captioner] 20:25:26
 RECOGNIZED ONE COMMUNITY, YOU SAY YES TO THEM, IT BECOMES MUCH

[Captioner] 20:25:28
 MORE AWKWARD TO SAY NO TO ANOTHER COMMUNITY.


[Captioner] 20:25:32
BUT THAT WAS IN THE CONTEXT OF PAID DAYS OFF FOR CITY

[Captioner] 20:25:35
 STAFF.
WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

[Captioner] 20:25:38
 TONIGHT IS BUYING SOME FLAGS WHICH

[Captioner] 20:25:42
 LAST FOR YEARS ONCE YOU BUY THEM,

[Captioner] 20:25:45
 TO RECOGNIZE SOME COMMUNITIES.
IT A MUCH LOWER

[Captioner] 20:25:49
 COST, MUCH EASIER THING TO DO, AND

[Captioner] 20:25:52
 AS FOR DIWALI AND LUNAR NEW YEAR

[Captioner] 20:25:55
, THOSE DO AFFECT A WHOLE LOT MORE PEOPLE THAN

[Captioner] 20:25:56
 SOME OF THE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE ALREADY ON THE LIST.


[Captioner] 20:26:00
SO I DON'T SEE THOSE AS REASONS TO LEAVE OUT

[Captioner] 20:26:02
 LUNAR NEW YEAR OR DIWALI.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:26:07
>> Mr. Quintanilla: WE HAVE ONE HAND RAISED IN ZOOM.


[Captioner] 20:26:11
YONGGANG.


[Captioner] 20:26:15
>> THANK YOU, COUNCIL.
GOOD EVENING.


[Captioner] 20:26:18
SO I THINK THE PROPOSALS FROM THE CITY STAFF

[Captioner] 20:26:22
 SHOULD HAVE AN OPTION TO DON'T

[Captioner] 20:26:26
 DO IT AT ALL.
MAINLY BECAUSE FIRST OF

[Captioner] 20:26:29
 ALL, A ROTATING

[Captioner] 20:26:33
 -- IT WILL BE

[Captioner] 20:26:37
 ADDED WORKLOAD FOR THE STAFF.
SECOND, THIS IS HARD

[Captioner] 20:26:40
 TO GET A

[Captioner] 20:26:44
 CONSENSUS FROM ALL THE COMMUNITIES.
THE LEAST OF HOLIDAYS OR

[Captioner] 20:26:47
 GOING TO BE LONGER AND LONGER

[Captioner] 20:26:52
, I THINK THE CITY SHOULD FOCUS MORE ON A

[Captioner] 20:26:56
 COMMUNITY-BASED CELEBRATION, LIKE A DIWALI OR NEW

[Captioner] 20:27:01
 YEAR'S, WE CELEBRATED EVERYWHERE IN THE CITY, AND

[Captioner] 20:27:04
 THE COUNCILMEMBER GO

[Captioner] 20:27:08
 -- ALL THE TIME RAISING A

[Captioner] 20:27:11
 FLAG.
IT REALLY DOESN'T ADD MUCH

[Captioner] 20:27:14
 VALUE, THE CITY ALLOCATED RESOURCES TO THE VENUES LIKE THE

[Captioner] 20:27:18
 CITY STAFF MEMBERS TO HELP COMMUNITY

[Captioner] 20:27:22
 TO BUILD -- TO CELEBRATE THEIR

[Captioner] 20:27:27
 EVENT IN A COMMUNITY-BASED MANNER.
YEAH, THANK

[Captioner] 20:27:30
 YOU.
>> Mr. Quintanilla: THAT WAS OUR

[Captioner] 20:27:35
 LAST SPEAKER.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK

[Captioner] 20:27:35
 YOU.
AND NOW I'LL RETURN TO THE COUNCIL FOR 

[Captioner] 20:27:38
COMMENTS.
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN, IS THIS FROM 

[Captioner] 20:27:40
BEFORE OR THIS IS NOW?
OKAY.


[Captioner] 20:27:43
GO AHEAD.
>> Councilmember Salwan: THANK

[Captioner] 20:27:46
 YOU, MADAME MAYOR, THANK YOU, CITY STAFF.


[Captioner] 20:27:49
CAN YOU HEAR ME?
AND OF COURSE ALL

[Captioner] 20:27:53
 THE FOLKS THAT CAME OUT.
THIS FLAG POLICY

[Captioner] 20:27:56
 IS NOT EASY, BECAUSE IT'S HARD TO

[Captioner] 20:27:59
 GET EVERYBODY INCLUDED, BUT IT

[Captioner] 20:28:02
 SOUNDS LIKE SOME OF THE TESTIMONY WE RECEIVED, ONE WAS TO INCORPORATE

[Captioner] 20:28:06
 LUNAR NEW YEAR.
AND

[Captioner] 20:28:11
 SECOND WAS EITHER DIWALI OR

[Captioner] 20:28:14
 HINDU HERITAGE

[Captioner] 20:28:17
 MONTH.
SO I WAS WONDERING IF STAFF WANTS TO 

[Captioner] 20:28:20
CIRCLE BACK WITH THE COMMUNITY AND SEE IF THEY CAN INCORPORATE THOSE

[Captioner] 20:28:22
 OR IS THAT SOMETHING WE SHOULD TRY AND FINALIZE TONIGHT?


[Captioner] 20:28:29
>> City Mgr. Shackelford: LET ME SEE.
WHERE DO I WANT TO START HERE?


[Captioner] 20:28:33
SO THE LIST THAT YOU HAVE BEFORE YOU IN THE

[Captioner] 20:28:37
 STAFF REPORT IS REFLECTIVE

[Captioner] 20:28:42
 OF ALL OF THE HERITAGE MONTHS THAT ARE OBSERVED AT

[Captioner] 20:28:45
 THE FEDERAL AND STATE LEVEL.


[Captioner] 20:28:51
AS STAFF REPORT SAYS BACK IN DECEMBER, WE HAD A

[Captioner] 20:28:54
 REFERRAL TO RAISE THE FLAG FOR BLACK HISTORY MONTH, FOLLOWED

[Captioner] 20:28:57
 BY THAT IN JANUARY, THERE WAS A

[Captioner] 20:29:00
 REFERRAL TO DO FLAG RAISINGS

[Captioner] 20:29:04
 FOR A MULTITUDE OF EVENT, AND THE DIRECTION YOU ALL GAVE US THEN WAS

[Captioner] 20:29:07
 TO COME BACK WITH

[Captioner] 20:29:11
 SELECTION CRITERIA

[Captioner] 20:29:13
 TO DETERMINE WHICH FLAGS TO RAISE AND WHEN.


[Captioner] 20:29:17
AND THAT'S WHAT YOU HAVE BEFORE YOU IN THE STAFF REPORT.


[Captioner] 20:29:21
THE LIST THAT'S THERE WAS IN NO WAY INTENDED TO

[Captioner] 20:29:25
 OFFEND ANYONE IN THE COMMUNITY.
BUT,

[Captioner] 20:29:28
 AGAIN, IT IS WHAT'S DONE AT THE STATE AND FEDERAL

[Captioner] 20:29:30
 LEVEL, WHICH GAVE US A STARTING POINT.


[Captioner] 20:29:33
THERE'S NOTHING IN THE SELECTION CRITERIA

[Captioner] 20:29:37
 TO PRECLUDE YOU ALL FROM ADDING A MONTH OR

[Captioner] 20:29:41
 TAKING SOMETHING OUT OR

[Captioner] 20:29:44
 ASKING, YOU KNOW, MODIFYING THE

[Captioner] 20:29:47
 SELECTION CRITERIA.
ANY WAY YOU SEE

[Captioner] 20:29:50
 FIT.
SO YOU KNOW, I THINK THAT'S

[Captioner] 20:29:53
 KIND OF THE STARTING POINT, IS JUST TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE

[Captioner] 20:29:57
 CRITERIA DOES NOT PRECLUDE ANYTHING FROM BEING ADDED

[Captioner] 20:30:00
 TO THE LIST OR SUBTRACTED FROM THE LIST.


[Captioner] 20:30:06
>> Councilmember Salwan: THANK YOU, SO IN THAT CASE, I THINK WE CAN ADD THOSE 

[Captioner] 20:30:09
TWO EVENTS, OR THOSE TWO FLAGS.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:30:14
I SEE NEXT ON THE -- IT'S ACTUALLY COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN

[Captioner] 20:30:18
.
COX KOCH BUT ACTUALLY I

[Captioner] 20:30:20
 HAVE REQUESTED TO SPEAK AFTER THE PUBLIC COMMENTS.


[Captioner] 20:30:23
THAT'S WHAT MY FIRST -- WHEN YOU HAD CALLED UPON ME FIRST.


[Captioner] 20:30:26
>> Mayor Mei: WE HAD ALREADY GONE BACK AND I'M TRYING TO FOLLOW

[Captioner] 20:30:29
 THE ORDER OF THE PEOPLE, COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, BUT WE'LL ASK YOU NEXT.


[Captioner] 20:30:33
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN.
>> Councilmember Kassan: I THINK IT'S 

[Captioner] 20:30:36
VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE DON'T INCLUDE ANYTHING THAT IS TIED TO

[Captioner] 20:30:38
 ANY RELIGION.
RELIGION IS A VERY PERSONAL THING.


[Captioner] 20:30:42
AND THERE ARE MANY, MANY RELIGIONS IN OUR CITY.


[Captioner] 20:30:45
I DO NOTE THAT JEWISH AMERICAN HERITAGE

[Captioner] 20:30:48
 IS INCLUD

[Captioner] 20:30:52
ED,

[Captioner] 20:30:55
 JUDDAISM IS DEFINITELY A RELIGION, SO I WOULD NOT AT ALL AGREE WITH

[Captioner] 20:30:57
 ADDING ANYTHING THAT HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH RELIGION.


[Captioner] 20:31:01
I DON'T THINK THAT'S RIGHT.
THAT'S NOT OUR ROLE AS A

[Captioner] 20:31:04
 GOVERNMENT, TO TRY TO UPHOLD ANY PARTICULAR RELIGION.


[Captioner] 20:31:08
THERE'S MULTIPLE RELIGIONS IN OUR CITY, AND WE DON'T

[Captioner] 20:31:10
 HAVE ENOUGH DAYS IN THE YEAR TO RECOGNIZE ALL OF THEM.


[Captioner] 20:31:13
THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:31:17
NEXT, VICE MAYOR COX.


[Captioner] 20:31:21
>> Vice Mayor Cox: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:31:24
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I WANT TO MAKE SURE IT'S IMPORTANT AS WE'RE LOOKING 

[Captioner] 20:31:28
AT THIS LIST, WE'RE ALSO NOT SHOWING WHAT

[Captioner] 20:31:31
 ALL THE PROCLAMATIONS THAT WE DO

[Captioner] 20:31:36
 TO REFLECT ALSO IN THE 
COMMUNITY.


[Captioner] 20:31:39
AND THAT'S ONE PIECE THAT I

[Captioner] 20:31:42
 
THINK WE

[Captioner] 20:31:46
 SHOULD HAVE AN 
UNDERSTANDING REGULAR FER THAT 


[Captioner] 20:31:49
WE DO HAVE PROCLAMATIONS FOR ALL 
OF THE ITEMS THAT

[Captioner] 20:31:52
 WE DO ON A 
MONTHLY

[Captioner] 20:31:56
 BASIS, STATE OF 
CALIFORNIA AS WELL AS THE COUNTY

[Captioner] 20:31:58
 
HAS THE SAME AND ALSO AS THE 


[Captioner] 20:32:01
CITY.
I THINK THAT'S ANOTHER

[Captioner] 20:32:05
 PART THAT 
ADDINGS INTO THE PICTURE OF

[Captioner] 20:32:09
 
DOING CEREMONIAL ITEMS.

[Captioner] 20:32:13

THIS IS THE FLAG, WE HAVE THE 


[Captioner] 20:32:15
PROCLAMATION.
THE OTHER PART IS THAT I WOULD 


[Captioner] 20:32:18
NOT WANT TO EXCLUDE GROUPS THAT 
HAVE BEEN

[Captioner] 20:32:22
 DOING CELEBRATIONS 
ALREADY, SUCH AS

[Captioner] 20:32:25
 CELEBRATING 
DWALI AND LUNAR

[Captioner] 20:32:28
 NEW YEAR THAT WE 
JUST RECENTLY DID

[Captioner] 20:32:30
 THIS PAST 
YEAR.


[Captioner] 20:32:33
I DON'T THINK THERE WOULD BE 
ANYTHING WRONG IN ADDING THOSE 


[Captioner] 20:32:35
TO THE LIST TO SUPPORT THAT 
EFFORT TO BE INCLUSIVE BECAUSE 


[Captioner] 20:32:38
SOME OF THESE GROUPS HAVE BEEN 
DOING I.T. A LONG TIME.


[Captioner] 20:32:41
I ALSO WANTED TO MAKE SURE

[Captioner] 20:32:45
 WE 
UNDERSTAND THE PICTURE WHETHER

[Captioner] 20:32:50
 
IT'S 9, 12 THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT 


[Captioner] 20:32:53
HERE, HOW MANY PEOPLE DOES IT 
TAKE TO DO FLAG RAISING

[Captioner] 20:32:56
?
AND WHAT IS THE COST FOR 


[Captioner] 20:33:00
ESTIMATED WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO 
FIGURE OUT HERE

[Captioner] 20:33:03
?
AND DOING EACH ONE OF THESE FLAG 


[Captioner] 20:33:05
RAISINGS?
SO WHAT WOULD BE A COST FOR 


[Captioner] 20:33:08
DOING EACH FLAG RAISING?

[Captioner] 20:33:13

>> IN OUR PRIOR PRESENTATION TO 


[Captioner] 20:33:16
COUNCIL WE ESTIMATED WITH NO 
ATTACHED CEREMONIAL ACTIVITIES 


[Captioner] 20:33:20
THAT EACH FLAG RAISING WOULD 
COST AROUND

[Captioner] 20:33:24
 $700.
>> Vice Mayor Cox:   IS THAT

[Captioner] 20:33:26
 
INCLUDING FLAG REQUISITION?


[Captioner] 20:33:28
>> THAT'S CORRECT.
>> Vice Mayor Cox:   AND THEN 


[Captioner] 20:33:32
THE RESOURCE OF THE LABOR 
ATTACHED TO THAT?


[Captioner] 20:33:32
>> THAT'S CORRECT.
>> Vice Mayor Cox:   THAT'S THE 


[Captioner] 20:33:36
WHOLE THING, $700 PER FLAG?

[Captioner] 20:33:37

>> PER DAY.


[Captioner] 20:33:40
>> Vice Mayor Cox:   PER DAY FOR 
DOING ONE FLAG RAISING FOR THAT

[Captioner] 20:33:41
 
DAY?


[Captioner] 20:33:44
>> CORRECT, YES.


[Captioner] 20:33:48
>> Vice Mayor Cox:   AND THAT IS 
COMING OUT OF OUR GENERAL 


[Captioner] 20:33:50
OPERATING BUDGET?
>> YES.


[Captioner] 20:33:54
>> Vice Mayor Cox:   OKAY.


[Captioner] 20:34:00
>> Mayor Mei:   SO DO YOU HAVE 
ANY

[Captioner] 20:34:03
 OTHER CLARIFYING QUESTIONS?
>> Vice Mayor Cox:   I WAS GOING 


[Captioner] 20:34:06
TO FINISH, GIVE ME A SECOND.
SO ROUGHLY IF WE'RE LOOK

[Captioner] 20:34:10
ING AT 
TEN TO 12, WE'RE ONLY TALKING 


[Captioner] 20:34:13
ABOUT $7,000 AND LOOKING IN 
TERMS OF MAKING

[Captioner] 20:34:16
 SURE WE'RE NOT 
OFFENDING ANY OF OUR GROUPS THAT 


[Captioner] 20:34:19
HAVE BEEN LONG STANDING IN OUR 
COMMUNITY.


[Captioner] 20:34:22
SO WE'RE TALKING LESS THAN 
$15,000, $

[Captioner] 20:34:25
12,000, GIVE OR TAKE 
DEPENDING ON THE NUMBER OF

[Captioner] 20:34:27
 
FLAG-RAISING.


[Captioner] 20:34:30
I THINK THAT AS WE KEEP

[Captioner] 20:34:31
 
PRACTICING AND SAYING THAT WE 


[Captioner] 20:34:35
ARE ABOUT DIVERSITY, EQUITY,

[Captioner] 20:34:37
 
INCLUSION I THINK IT'S REALLY 


[Captioner] 20:34:40
IMPORTANT THAT WE DEMONSTRATE BY 
THE ACTIONS AND INCLUDING TWO 


[Captioner] 20:34:43
ADDITIONAL ITEMS, THAT HAVE

[Captioner] 20:34:46
 BEEN 
EXPRESSED BY ABOUT 15 OR 20 


[Captioner] 20:34:50
DIFFERENT PUBLIC COMMENTS 
WRITTEN TO THE CITY,

[Captioner] 20:34:52
 BUT ALSO 
THOSE THAT I'VE RECEIVED 


[Captioner] 20:34:55
COMMUNICATIONS FROM AS WELL.
AND THAT WOULD MEAN THAT WE'RE 


[Captioner] 20:35:00
CELEBRATING BLACK

[Captioner] 20:35:03
 HISTORY MONTH 
WHICH WAS ALREADY APPROVED BACK 


[Captioner] 20:35:06
IN DECEMBER BY THE COUNCIL 
ANNUAL

[Captioner] 20:35:10
LY GOING FORWARD, WOMEN'S 
HISTORY MONTH

[Captioner] 20:35:14
, ARAB AMERICAN 
HERITAGE MONTH, I'M NOT SURE 


[Captioner] 20:35:16
WHEN WE HAD DONE A LOT OF THOSE 
CELEBRATIONS ON THAT ONE BUT THE 


[Captioner] 20:35:20
REST OF THEM WE HAVE WITH AAPI, 
JEWISH

[Captioner] 20:35:23
 AMERICAN, LGBTQ

[Captioner] 20:35:27
, 
HISPANIC, NATIVE AMERICAN

[Captioner] 20:35:28
 
HERITAGE MONTH.


[Captioner] 20:35:31
I THINK WITH THIS COMPREHENSIVE 
LIST

[Captioner] 20:35:35
 WITH THE ADDITION OF ADDING 
DIWALI AND

[Captioner] 20:35:38
 ADDING THE LUNAR

[Captioner] 20:35:41
 NEW 
YEAR I DON'T REALLY THINK WE'RE 


[Captioner] 20:35:44
TALKING A LOT OF REALLY SMALL 
DOLLAR AMOUNT TO BE ABLE

[Captioner] 20:35:47
 TO WORK 
AND BOND AND WORK WITH OUR 


[Captioner] 20:35:49
COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN DOING 
SOME OF THESE ACTIVITIES FOR 


[Captioner] 20:35:53
OVER 20, 30 YEARS.
AND SO I REALLY THINK

[Captioner] 20:35:56
 WE SHOULD 
REALLY RETHINK THAT AND SINCE WE

[Captioner] 20:36:00
 
ARE COUNCIL, WE DO SET POLICIES,

[Captioner] 20:36:01
 
AND WHAT MAY HAPPEN AT THE STATE 


[Captioner] 20:36:05
OR THE FEDERAL LEVEL, WE COULD 
ALSO HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY

[Captioner] 20:36:08
 OF 
MAKING DECISIONS RIGHT HERE WITH

[Captioner] 20:36:11
 
OTHER CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS

[Captioner] 20:36:13
' 
INPUT.


[Captioner] 20:36:16
BUT I ALSO HAVE TO ASK THE 
QUESTION:  HOW COME WE HAVE

[Captioner] 20:36:18
 NOT 
UTILIZED AND I TALKED ABOUT THIS 


[Captioner] 20:36:21
IN FEBRUARY WHEN THE 
PRESENTATION WAS MADE THEN, HOW 


[Captioner] 20:36:24
HAVE WE NOT IN ECHOING OUR HRC

[Captioner] 20:36:28
 
CHAIR MARTY CALUJA,

[Captioner] 20:36:31
 HOW COULD WE 
HAVE NEVER UTILIZED OUR HUMAN 


[Captioner] 20:36:34
RESOURCE COMMISSION FOR THESE 
TYPE OF DISCUSSIONS?


[Captioner] 20:36:37
BECAUSE THIS IS NOT THE FIRST 
TIME THAT I BROUGHT IT UP.

[Captioner] 20:36:40

AND I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND 


[Captioner] 20:36:43
WHERE HAVE WE NOT BEEN ABLE TO 
CONNECT WITH THEM?


[Captioner] 20:36:46
BECAUSE AFTER ALL THEY ARE 
REPRESENTING OUR CITY ON THESE 


[Captioner] 20:36:50
COMMISSIONS.


[Captioner] 20:36:53
>> THE COMMISSIONS WORK AT THE 
PLEASURE OF THE MAYOR AND THE 


[Captioner] 20:36:56
COUNCIL.
AND YOU ALL ARE -- CAN YOU KNOW

[Captioner] 20:36:59
 
SET THEIR WORK PLANS AND DIRECT 


[Captioner] 20:37:02
THESE TYPES OF ITEMS TO THEM.

[Captioner] 20:37:05

SO IT'S NOT A STAFF-

[Captioner] 20:37:06
DRIVEN 
PROCESS.


[Captioner] 20:37:08
IT'S AT THE DIRECTION OF THE 
MAYOR AND THE COUNCIL.


[Captioner] 20:37:12
>> Vice Mayor Cox:   OKAY.
BUT I KNOW I'VE SAID IT SEVERAL 


[Captioner] 20:37:15
TIMES, AND IN PUBLIC MEETINGS, 
THAT WE NEED TO INCLUDE THEM AND 


[Captioner] 20:37:19
WEIGH IN ON THIS PART OF THE 
PROCESS BEFORE WE HAVE MADE SOME 


[Captioner] 20:37:22
DECISIONS HERE.

[Captioner] 20:37:25

AND I KNOW ANOTHER PART IS THAT 


[Captioner] 20:37:28
HAVING THIS TYPE OF DISCUSSION

[Captioner] 20:37:31
, 
ALTHOUGH IT'S VERY IMPORTANT BUT 


[Captioner] 20:37:34
IT IS SOMETHING THAT IS TAKING 
US AWAY FROM OUR TOP THREE 


[Captioner] 20:37:37
PRIORITIES THAT WE HAVE VOTED AS 
THE TOP PRIORITIES OR THE THE

[Captioner] 20:37:38
 
COUNCIL ON PUBLIC SAFETY, 


[Captioner] 20:37:42
HOMELESSNESS, AND THE COMMERCIAL 
CORRIDORS

[Captioner] 20:37:46
.
BUT I JUST WANT TO LEAVE WITH 


[Captioner] 20:37:49
THE THOUGHT THAT HOW BEST CAN WE 
SERVE OUR COMMUNITY?

[Captioner] 20:37:51

AND WITH THE DOWNTOWN CENTER 


[Captioner] 20:37:54
HAVING THE BUILDING NAME PLATE 
WITH CORET

[Captioner] 20:37:58
 RVETIONA SCOTT CIJ'S 
QUOTE

[Captioner] 20:38:01
, IT IS ALWAYS STATED THAT 
THE SEGREGATE

[Captioner] 20:38:04
 GREATNESS OF THE COMMUNITY 
IS IS

[Captioner] 20:38:07
 ALWAYS MEASURED WITH THE 
COMPASSION OF ITS MEMBERS TO 


[Captioner] 20:38:10
SERVE WITH LOVE AND GRACE.
I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING WE 


[Captioner] 20:38:13
REALLY SHOULD THINK ABOUT 
TONIGHT AS WE'RE MAKING 


[Captioner] 20:38:16
DECISIONS ON THAT AND HOW WE CAN 
BE MORE OF AN

[Captioner] 20:38:19
 INCLUSIVE 
COMMUNITY AND BOND MORE WITH

[Captioner] 20:38:22
 OUR 
COMMUNITY.


[Captioner] 20:38:24
BECAUSE AFTER ALL, WE ARE 
ELECTED BY THE COMMUNITY BUT WE 


[Captioner] 20:38:27
WORK FOR THE COMMUNITY.
THANK YOU

[Captioner] 20:38:30
.
>> Mayor Mei:   NEXT IS

[Captioner] 20:38:32
 
COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL.


[Captioner] 20:38:35
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:38:37
>> Councilmember Campbell:   
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:38:40
I WANTED TO CLARIFY, 
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN, WERE YOU

[Captioner] 20:38:41
 
SAYING YOU WERE IN AGREEMENT 


[Captioner] 20:38:45
WITH LUNAR NEW YEAR AND DIWALI

[Captioner] 20:38:46
?
>> Councilmember Salwan:   THAT 


[Captioner] 20:38:48
IS CORRECT, MA'AM.
>> Councilmember Campbell:   


[Captioner] 20:38:50
OKAY.
AND THEN COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, 


[Captioner] 20:38:53
DID YOU SAY THAT YOU WOULD BE 
OWNED TO

[Captioner] 20:38:57
 JEWISH AMERICAN 
HERITAGE MONTH

[Captioner] 20:39:01
?

[Captioner] 20:39:02

>> Councilmember Kassan:   I 


[Captioner] 20:39:05
WOULD BE OPPOSED TO ANYTHING 
THAT IS RELIGIOUS AND THAT DOES

[Captioner] 20:39:08
 
INCLUDE DIWALI.


[Captioner] 20:39:11
>> Councilmember Campbell:   AND 
IS DIWALI

[Captioner] 20:39:14
 CONSIDERED A RELIGIOUS 
HOLIDAY, DID IT

[Captioner] 20:39:17
 HAVE A RELIGIOUS 
CONNOTATION?


[Captioner] 20:39:20
I DIDN'T SEE THAT WHEN I WAS 
DOING MY RESEARCH

[Captioner] 20:39:21
.
NO.


[Captioner] 20:39:23
OKAY.
AND THEN THE OTHER THING I THINK 


[Captioner] 20:39:27
ONE OF THE CRITERIA THAT WE 
TALKED ABOUT AT

[Captioner] 20:39:30
 LENGTH WAS THE 
FACT IF WE COULD FIND A FLAG.


[Captioner] 20:39:33
I MEAN WE CAN'T RAISE A FLAG IF 
THERE'S NO FLAG.

[Captioner] 20:39:36

SO IS THERE A FLAG THAT

[Captioner] 20:39:39
 
REPRESENTS DIWALI AND LUNAR NEW 


[Captioner] 20:39:42
YEAR OR DO WE HAVE TO MAKE UP 
ONE?

[Captioner] 20:39:44

>> Vice Mayor Cox:   THEY'RE 


[Captioner] 20:39:46
BOTH EXIST.
>> Councilmember Campbell:   I'M 


[Captioner] 20:39:48
SORRY?
>> WE HAVE IT.


[Captioner] 20:39:50
>> Councilmember Campbell:   
THEY HAVE A FLAG THAT REPRESENTS 


[Captioner] 20:39:53
DIWALI AND LUNAR NEW YEAR?
BECAUSE THAT

[Captioner] 20:39:56
 WAS ONE -- I SEE 
SMILES.


[Captioner] 20:39:59
NOBODY'S GIVING ME AN ANSWER.
I HEAR A

[Captioner] 20:40:02
 COUPLE BUT I WANT TO -- 
I DON'T NEED THEM TO SPEAK FOR 


[Captioner] 20:40:05
YOU.
I NEED YOU TO SPEAK FOR YOURSELF 


[Captioner] 20:40:08
IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO FIND IT 
OR TO BE ABLE TO DO IT

[Captioner] 20:40:11
.



[Captioner] 20:40:14
>> Mayor Mei:   I THINK MUCH 
LIKE THE BLACK HISTORY FLAG

[Captioner] 20:40:16
 AND 
JUNETEENTH WE'VE HAD THEM 


[Captioner] 20:40:19
DONATED BY DIFFERENT GROUPS AND 
IT SEEMS LIKE FROM THE COMMUNITY 


[Captioner] 20:40:21
HERE AND THAT PERHAPS IS 
SOMETHING WHEN WE TALK ABOUT 


[Captioner] 20:40:24
WITH THE HUMAN RELATIONS 
COMMISSION IF WE NEED TO WE CAN 


[Captioner] 20:40:27
GO TO THE PUBLIC TO FINALIZE 
DOWN TO WHICHEVER ONE THEY FEEL

[Captioner] 20:40:31
 
IS BEST, THERE ARE MULTIPLE

[Captioner] 20:40:33
 ONES 
EVEN FOR JUNETEENTH.


[Captioner] 20:40:37
THERE ARE MULTIPLE FLAGS.
I'M SURE THAT IS ONE THAT THE

[Captioner] 20:40:39
 
COMMUNITY IS WILLING TO WORK ON.


[Captioner] 20:40:42
THE COST, THE OTHER THING THAT'S 
ADDRESSED IN THE

[Captioner] 20:40:45
 PAST IS IF WE 
HAVE THE COMMUNITY DONATE

[Captioner] 20:40:47
 THE 
FLAG AND THERE'S MORE THAN 


[Captioner] 20:40:50
SUFFICIENT INTEREST IN DONATING 
THE FLAGS.


[Captioner] 20:40:52
>> Councilmember Campbell:   
RIGHT BUT WE SAID WE DIDN'T WANT 


[Captioner] 20:40:54
TO DO THAT.
AND IN THE STAFF REPORT IT ALSO 


[Captioner] 20:40:57
SAYS THE SAME THING.
>> Mayor Mei:   WE'VE HAD THOSE 


[Captioner] 20:40:59
DONATED PREVIOUSLY.
>> Councilmember Campbell:   NO, 


[Captioner] 20:41:01
I'M JUST SPEAK GOING WHAT I 
READ.


[Captioner] 20:41:03
>> Mayor Mei:   OKAY.
>> Councilmember Campbell:   AND 


[Captioner] 20:41:06
IT SAID THE STAFF WOULD BE 
RESPONSIBLE FOR PROSE CURING IT

[Captioner] 20:41:09
 
AND STORING IT AND RAISING IT 


[Captioner] 20:41:12
AND ALL THOSE KINDS OF THINGS IN 
TEMPS OF PROCESS.


[Captioner] 20:41:15
BECAUSE YOU WANTED TO MAKE IT 
STANDARD SO EVERY FLAG WOULD BE

[Captioner] 20:41:17
 
THE SAME SIZE, IT WOULD FIT ON 


[Captioner] 20:41:20
OUR POLE, WE DIDN'T WANT THEM 
DONATED FROM THE COMMUNITY

[Captioner] 20:41:22
.
>> Mayor Mei:   THE OTHER ONES 


[Captioner] 20:41:25
WERE DONATED THOUGH, SOME OF 
THEM SO THAT'S WHY I WANTED TO 


[Captioner] 20:41:27
MAKE SURE WE'RE CONSISTENT.
>> Councilmember Campbell:   


[Captioner] 20:41:30
OKAY.
>> COUNCIL'S PRIOR ACTION DID 


[Captioner] 20:41:33
DICTATE THAT STAFF WILL ACQUIRE 
THE FLAG FOR CONSISTENCY SAKE

[Captioner] 20:41:36
 ON 
AN ONGOING BASIS.


[Captioner] 20:41:38
>> Councilmember Campbell:   
YES, THAT'S WHAT MY 


[Captioner] 20:41:40
UNDERSTANDING.
>> BUT THAT DOESN'T PRECLUDE 


[Captioner] 20:41:43
STAFF FROM CONSULTING WITH THE 
HUMAN RELATIONS COMMISSION OR 


[Captioner] 20:41:46
THE COMMUNITY TO MAKE A 
DETERMINATION ABOUT WHICH FLAG 


[Captioner] 20:41:47
TO ACQUIRE.
>> Councilmember Campbell:   


[Captioner] 20:41:49
CORRECT, CORRECT.
AND THEN THE OTHER QUESTION THAT 


[Captioner] 20:41:53
I HAD WAS THE

[Captioner] 20:41:56
 FISCAL IMPACT.
I HEARD

[Captioner] 20:41:59
 COUNCILMEMBER COX SAY IT 
WAS $17,000.


[Captioner] 20:42:02
THIS REPORT SAYS IT WAS $35

[Captioner] 20:42:04
00 
PER STAFF AND MATERIAL EXPENSE.


[Captioner] 20:42:07
IS THAT PER

[Captioner] 20:42:11
 FLAG-RAISING OR 
WHAT'S THE 3500?

[Captioner] 20:42:13

LET ME JUST ASK THE QUESTION.


[Captioner] 20:42:16
>> 700 TIME 5, THE FIVE EVENTS

[Captioner] 20:42:18
 
THAT COUNCIL HAD PREVIOUSLY 


[Captioner] 20:42:19
AUTHORIZED.
>> Councilmember Campbell:   I 


[Captioner] 20:42:21
SEE.
BUT THAT WOULDN'T BE YEAR OVER 


[Captioner] 20:42:24
YEAR BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO 
KEEP THE FLAG SO THE COST WOULD 


[Captioner] 20:42:27
DECREASE SECOND YEAR BECAUSE YOU 
WOULDN'T HAVE TO BUY A FLAG.


[Captioner] 20:42:30
TECHNICALLY.
>> IT WOULD, A MAJORITY OF

[Captioner] 20:42:32
 THAT 
COST IS IN LABOR.


[Captioner] 20:42:33
>> Councilmember Campbell:   OH, 
OKAY.


[Captioner] 20:42:35
OKAY.
AND SO OKAY.


[Captioner] 20:42:38
SO GIVEN THAT, AND HEARING WHAT

[Captioner] 20:42:41
 
I HEARD, I WOULD

[Captioner] 20:42:44
 NOT BE OPPOSED 
TO THE DIWAL

[Captioner] 20:42:48
I OR THE LUNAR NEW 
YEAR BUT I WOULD CAUTION US

[Captioner] 20:42:51
, AND 
I -- I KNOW

[Captioner] 20:42:54
 I'VE SAID THIS 
BEFORE, THAT WE --

[Captioner] 20:42:57
 WE'RE NOT 
LIKE CONTINUOUSLY

[Captioner] 20:43:00
 DOING -- 
RECOGNIZING THE SAME THINGS OVER 


[Captioner] 20:43:03
AND OVER AGAIN, RIGHT?
WE RAISE THE FLAG.


[Captioner] 20:43:06
WE DO

[Captioner] 20:43:11
 A PROCLAMATION.
WE DO A CELEBRATION.


[Captioner] 20:43:14
WE HAVE PEOPLE COME IN.
I JUST DON'T KNOW WHERE WE STOP

[Captioner] 20:43:17
.
WHERE WE SAY, YOU KNOW, ENOUGH 


[Captioner] 20:43:20
IS ENOUGH.
WE'RE GOING TO DO THIS, AND 


[Captioner] 20:43:23
WE'RE NOT GOING TO DO 
PROCLAMATIONS, WE'RE NOT GOING 


[Captioner] 20:43:27
TO DO FLAG RAISINGS, WE'RE NOT 
GOING TO DO CELEBRATION

[Captioner] 20:43:29
S.
WHAT ARE WE -- WE TALKED ABOUT 


[Captioner] 20:43:32
DOING A MULTICULTURAL KIND OF 
EVENT.


[Captioner] 20:43:35
WE HAD THE HUMAN SERVICES 
DEPARTMENT LOOK AT

[Captioner] 20:43:39
 HOW WE COULD 
CREATE THIS MULTICULTURAL 


[Captioner] 20:43:43
CELEBRATION EVERY YEAR.
SO I JUST DON'T KNOW

[Captioner] 20:43:44
 WHEN IT'S 
GOING TO STOP SO WE CAN GET ON 


[Captioner] 20:43:47
WITH THE OTHER BUSINESS AND ONE 
OF THE OTHER PRIORITIES WAS THE 


[Captioner] 20:43:50
UNSHELTERED POPULATION.
THAT

[Captioner] 20:43:52
 COUNCILMEMBER COX DENT 
MEMBERS.


[Captioner] 20:43:54
BUT WE HAVE THOSE OTHER 
PRIORITIES.


[Captioner] 20:43:57
SO I JUST WOULD LIKE TO SEE 
WHERE -- WHAT THE PROCESS

[Captioner] 20:44:00
 WILL 
LOOK LIKE, HOW MANY 


[Captioner] 20:44:03
CELEBRATIONS, WHO WE'RE 
CELEBRATING, WHETHER

[Captioner] 20:44:06
 THERE'S 
FLAG RAISING, WHETHER THERE'S 


[Captioner] 20:44:09
PROCLAMATIONS, WHETHER THERE'S 
PROCLAMATIONS AND FLAG RAISINGS

[Captioner] 20:44:12
 
AND CELEBRATIONS.


[Captioner] 20:44:14
IT GETS TO BE A LOT OF STAFF 
TIME WHEN YOU PUT IT ALL 


[Captioner] 20:44:17
TOGETHER.
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:44:20
NEXT IS COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN.
DID YOU WANT TO

[Captioner] 20:44:23
 ADD SOMETHING?
>> Councilmember Kassan:   YEAH

[Captioner] 20:44:27
.
I'M NOT -- I'M

[Captioner] 20:44:28
 NOT A RELIGIOUS 
PERSON.


[Captioner] 20:44:31
BUT I THINK I DON'T THINK IT'S 
RIGHT TO SAY

[Captioner] 20:44:35
 THAT DIWALI IS NOT

[Captioner] 20:44:36
 
A RELIGIOUS HOLIDAY.


[Captioner] 20:44:39
IF WE WOULD SAY THAT WE WOULD 
NEED TO TALK TO OTHER PEOPLE IN 


[Captioner] 20:44:43
THE COMMUNITY SUCH AS MUSLIMS 
AND

[Captioner] 20:44:46
 ASK THEIR OPINION.
SO I JUST -- THIS JUST TAKES US

[Captioner] 20:44:48
 
DOWN SUCH A SLIBBARY SLOPE.


[Captioner] 20:44:52
I MEAN -- SLIPPERY SLOPE.

[Captioner] 20:44:54

THERE ARE SO MANY RELIGIOUS IN

[Captioner] 20:44:58
 
RELIGIONS IN OUR COMMUNITY AND I

[Captioner] 20:45:00
 
THINK WE NEED TO LEAVE RELIGION 


[Captioner] 20:45:03
OUT OF THIS BECAUSE IT WILL 
OFFEND PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITY 


[Captioner] 20:45:06
WHO DON'T EXPWREAT DIWALI.
EVEN THOUGH

[Captioner] 20:45:10
 A BUNCH OF PEOPLE 
SHOUT THEY'D IT'S NOT

[Captioner] 20:45:13
 A 
RELIGIOUS HOLIDAY, SOME PEOPLE 


[Captioner] 20:45:16
SEE IT AS A RELIGIOUS HOLIDAY 
AND WOULD NOT FEEL

[Captioner] 20:45:19
 COMFORTABLE 
WHEN WE CELEBRATED ONE

[Captioner] 20:45:23
 RELIGIOUS 
HOLIDAY WITH A FLAG RAISING AND 


[Captioner] 20:45:24
NOT OTHERS.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:45:27
>> Mayor Mei:   DID I SKIP YOU?
I'M TRYING TO PUSH

[Captioner] 20:45:30
 THROUGH 
BUTTONS AND SCROLL THROUGH LIST

[Captioner] 20:45:33
.
>> I'LL GO NEXT.


[Captioner] 20:45:36
>> Mayor Mei:   I APOLOGIZE AND 
THEN I'LL GO AFTER YOU.


[Captioner] 20:45:41
GO AHEAD.
>> Councilmember Keng:   I 


[Captioner] 20:45:44
REALLY APPRECIATE ALL THE 
COMMUNITY MEMBERS GIVING

[Captioner] 20:45:47
 US 
INPUT ON THIS.


[Captioner] 20:45:50
IN HINDSIGHT WE SHOULD

[Captioner] 20:45:52
 HAVE GONE 
WITH RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE 


[Captioner] 20:45:53
HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION AND THE 
MEMBERS.


[Captioner] 20:45:56
BUT I DO AGREE THAT WE --

[Captioner] 20:45:59
 HAVING 
FAMILY FROM, YOU KNOW, BOTH THE 


[Captioner] 20:46:03
CHINESE AND ASIAN COMMUNITY AND 
FROM INDIAN,

[Captioner] 20:46:06
 INDIA I DO

[Captioner] 20:46:09
 GRAY CONSIDERING 
THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF FREMONT AND 


[Captioner] 20:46:12
HEARING IN THE LAST I THINK MORE 
THAN HALF A YEAR OF THE 


[Captioner] 20:46:15
COMMUNITY FEEDBACK THAT WE HAVE 
HEARD BOTH HERE

[Captioner] 20:46:18
 AND IN 
COMMUNICATIONS, I DO DISAGREE 


[Captioner] 20:46:21
THAT WE SHOULD ADD -- I DO AGREE 
THAT WE

[Captioner] 20:46:24
 SHOULD ADD DI 
WFERTIONALI

[Captioner] 20:46:27
 AND LUNAR NEW YEAR 
CELEBRATION AS THE TWO

[Captioner] 20:46:31
 
ADDITIONAL ADDITIONAL 


[Captioner] 20:46:34
CONSIDERATIONS.
 I THINK WE

[Captioner] 20:46:37
 CAN IF WE WANT TO 
DISCUSS MORE IF WE WANTED

[Captioner] 20:46:40
 -- IF 
THIS IS TOO MANY EVENTS FOR THE 


[Captioner] 20:46:43
STAFF TO HOST EVERY YEAR, I 
THINK

[Captioner] 20:46:47
 IT'S PROBABLY IMPOSSIBLE 
TO

[Captioner] 20:46:50
 RECOGNIZE EVERY GROUP AND

[Captioner] 20:46:53
 
EVERY CULTURAL AND ETHNIC GROUP 


[Captioner] 20:46:56
CELEBRATION.
BUT WE ALSO BESIDES THESE FLAG 


[Captioner] 20:46:59
RAISING WE ALSO GIVE 
PROCLAMATIONS EACH MONTH

[Captioner] 20:47:03
 OR, YOU 
KNOW, AT DIFFERENT WEEKS OF THE

[Captioner] 20:47:05
 
COUNCIL MEETINGS, WHERE WE 


[Captioner] 20:47:08
RECOGNIZE DIFFERENT GROUPS OR 
DIFFERENT CAUSES

[Captioner] 20:47:12
 AND EVEN BRING 
THE GROUP TO THE CITY COUNCIL, 


[Captioner] 20:47:15
GIVE THEM CERTIFICATIONS AND 
THINGS LIKE THAT TO RECOGNIZE 


[Captioner] 20:47:19
THEM.
SO JUST AS YOU KNOW OTHER CITIES

[Captioner] 20:47:21
 
CAN POSSIBLY RECOGNIZE EVERY 


[Captioner] 20:47:25
GROUP AS A FLAG RAISING.
AND IF

[Captioner] 20:47:28
 WE -- I DON'T KNOW IF WE 
WANT TO INCLUDE ADDING THE

[Captioner] 20:47:31
 TWO, 
AND I THINK THAT MAKES TEN 


[Captioner] 20:47:35
EVENTS.
AND I THINK DOING LIKE, YOU 


[Captioner] 20:47:38
KNOW, ROTATING YEARS AND THINGS 
LIKE

[Captioner] 20:47:41
 THAT WOULD BE CONFUSING.
SO EITHER WE HAVE

[Captioner] 20:47:44
 THE CAPACITY 
AND, YOU KNOW,

[Captioner] 20:47:49
 PHYSICALLY WITH 
STAFF RESOURCES TO

[Captioner] 20:47:52
 HOST THESE 
RECOMMENDED EVENTS OR WE HAVE TO 


[Captioner] 20:47:56
PICK FEWER ITEMS THAT REFLECT 
THE COMMUNITY OF FREMONT

[Captioner] 20:47:58
.
THAT'S MY FEEDBACK.


[Captioner] 20:47:59
THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:48:01
SO I'D LIKE TO SHARE SOME OF MY 
THOUGHTS.


[Captioner] 20:48:04
AND I WANTED TO THANK EVERYONE 
WHO TOOK THE TIME TO COME

[Captioner] 20:48:07
 AND 
SPEAK ON THIS TOPICAL AS WELL AS 


[Captioner] 20:48:09
THOSE WHO HAVE WRITTEN.
I KNOW THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S 


[Captioner] 20:48:11
VERY IMPORTANT TO MANY MEMBERS 
OF THE COMMUNITY.


[Captioner] 20:48:14
I FEEL VERY BLESSED TO HAVE BEEN 
ABILITY TO SHARE IN MANY OF

[Captioner] 20:48:16
 
THESE GOING TO THE DIFFERENT 


[Captioner] 20:48:21
PLACES, WHETHER IT'S COMMUNITY 
CENTERS, OR SURROUND

[Captioner] 20:48:22
ING 
NEIGHBORING CITIES.


[Captioner] 20:48:25
AND THAT'S WHY ORIGINALLY WHEN 
THIS CAME UP I HAD MENTION THEY 


[Captioner] 20:48:28
HAD BECAUSE I'D SEEN IN OTHER 
CITIES LIKE

[Captioner] 20:48:32
 FOR EXAMPLE 
CUPERTINO, THEY ONLY HAVE TWO 


[Captioner] 20:48:39
 
DAYS TWO DAYS PRIDE DAY AND

[Captioner] 20:48:42
 THEY 
ONLY RAISE FLAGS IN CUPERTINO.

[Captioner] 20:48:44

BY THE FACT THEY ARE WORRIED 


[Captioner] 20:48:47
ABOUT THIS IS A SLIPPERY SLOPE 
AND ONCE YOU START YOU HAVE

[Captioner] 20:48:49
 TO 
BRING EVERYONE ELSE.


[Captioner] 20:48:52
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT MINORITIES 
AND REPRESENTATIVES, I HAD

[Captioner] 20:48:54
 
DISABILITY EMPLOYMENT AWARENESS 


[Captioner] 20:48:56
MONTH BECAUSE WE ARE HOME FOR 
THE SCHOOL FOR THE DEAF AROUND 


[Captioner] 20:48:59
THE SCHOOL FOR THE BLIND.
AND SO I THINK THAT PERSONALLY 


[Captioner] 20:49:02
WAS SOMETHING I FELT WAS VERY 
IMPORTANTLY AS WELL AS THE FACT 


[Captioner] 20:49:05
THAT I KNOW ONE OF MY PREVIOUSLY 
COUNCILMEMBERS WHO IS NOT HERE

[Captioner] 20:49:07
 
THIS EVENING HAD TALKED ABOUT 


[Captioner] 20:49:10
HOW WE ARE VERY FORTUNATE TO 
STAND

[Captioner] 20:49:13
 ON NATIVE AMERICAN LAND, 
TO RECOGNIZE THOSE WHO

[Captioner] 20:49:15
 CAME 
BEFORE US.


[Captioner] 20:49:18
AND TO HAVE THAT RECOGNITION OF 
THAT

[Captioner] 20:49:20
.
I KNOW THAT THIS IS A VERY 


[Captioner] 20:49:24
TOUCHY SUBJECT, BECAUSE I 
IRONICALLY

[Captioner] 20:49:28
 SAT THERE ALMOST 13 
YEARS AGO NOW AND WE

[Captioner] 20:49:30
 HAD THIS 
DISCUSSION ABOUT OTHER HOLIDAYS 


[Captioner] 20:49:33
AND AT THAT TIME, I'D ASKED 
ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT WE HAD 


[Captioner] 20:49:37
CELEBRATED ASIAN HERITAGE DAY, 
NOT

[Captioner] 20:49:40
 BECAUSE I'M PERSONALLY ASIAN 
BUT BY CHANCE WE ARE

[Captioner] 20:49:42
 THE SIXTH 
LARGEST ASIAN CITY IN THE UNITED 


[Captioner] 20:49:45
STATES AND ARE BLESSED TO HAVE 
SUCH A DIVERSITY.


[Captioner] 20:49:48
AND I THINK GROWING UP IT WAS 
VERY IMPORTANT TO HAVE

[Captioner] 20:49:49
 THAT 
REPRESENTATION BECAUSE I'VE SEEN 


[Captioner] 20:49:53
IN THIS MOMENT AT TIMES THE 
VIRUS THAT I'M MOST

[Captioner] 20:49:55
 CONCERNED 
ABOUT AND I'VE EXPRESSED IS NOT 


[Captioner] 20:49:58
THE VIRUS OF COVID, IT'S THE 
VIRUS OF HATE

[Captioner] 20:50:00
.
AND RIGHT NOW THERE ARE A LOT OF 


[Captioner] 20:50:02
MOMENTS WHERE PEOPLE ARE 
DIVIDED.


[Captioner] 20:50:05
AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR 
US TO UNITE THE COMMUNITY.


[Captioner] 20:50:08
I'M SO GRATEFUL AND GLAD WHEN 
I'M

[Captioner] 20:50:11
 GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY AND I 
SEE TODAY IN OUR AUDIENCE ALSO 


[Captioner] 20:50:14
MANY OF OUR SCOUTS WHO ARE HERE 
BECAUSE THEY HAVE

[Captioner] 20:50:17
 BEEN INVOLVED.
AND I PERSONALLY AM A LIFETIME

[Captioner] 20:50:20
 
GIRL SCOUT AND WAS A BOY SCOUT 


[Captioner] 20:50:23
TOO, IN EXPLORER.
SO IT'S GREAT THAT WE HAVE THAT 


[Captioner] 20:50:26
RESOURCE IF WE CAN TO UTILIZE 
SOME OF THAT AND MANY YEARS AGO 


[Captioner] 20:50:29
WE HAVE HAD FLAG RAISINGS AND 
OTHER OPPORTUNITIES USING OUR 


[Captioner] 20:50:32
YOUTH.
BUT I DEFINITELY DO APPRECIATE 


[Captioner] 20:50:35
THE COMMENTS.
I KNOW THAT WE'VE INCLUDED THE 


[Captioner] 20:50:37
HRC IN THE PAST.
I THINK THAT PERHAPS THAT IS 


[Captioner] 20:50:41
SOMETHING THAT CAN HELP 
FACILITATE WITH US ON --

[Captioner] 20:50:42
 WE'VE 
TALKED ABOUT IN THE PAST WITH 


[Captioner] 20:50:45
THE FACT THAT WE HAVE SO MANY 
COMMISSIONS AND THAT IT WOULD BE 


[Captioner] 20:50:48
GREAT SOMETIMES IF THE COUNCIL 
MEETS WITH THE COMMISSIONS ON 


[Captioner] 20:50:51
ROTATING BASIS SO WE CAN 
DRIVE -- BECAUSE I KNOW THAT 


[Captioner] 20:50:55
WHEN I KNOW

[Captioner] 20:50:58
 COUNCILMEMBER 
CAMPBELL AND I WERE ON SCHOOL 


[Captioner] 20:51:01
BOARD, IT WAS USUALLY IN THE 
PAST WHEN THE SITUATION THE

[Captioner] 20:51:03
 
GOVERNING BODY MEETS WITH THEM 


[Captioner] 20:51:06
TO GIVE AN AGENDA OF ITEMS THAT 
WE'D LIKE TO FOCUS ON FOR THE 


[Captioner] 20:51:09
YEAR.
SO IT'S NOT THAT WITH WITH THE

[Captioner] 20:51:11
 
COMMISSION DRIVING IT ALONE IT'S 


[Captioner] 20:51:14
ACTUALLY THE GOVERNING COUNCIL 
WHICH HAS FORMED THE COMMISSION 


[Captioner] 20:51:16
THAT IS ASKING US TO FIGURE OUT 
SOME OF THE GUIDANCE OF WHAT WE 


[Captioner] 20:51:20
THINK WOULD BE THE BEST TOPICS 
THAT WE CAN SERVE AND WORK ON.

[Captioner] 20:51:22

BUT I AM SUPPORTIVE OF THIS.


[Captioner] 20:51:25
I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT

[Captioner] 20:51:27
 
I KNOW LUNAR NEW YEAR IS 


[Captioner] 20:51:30
SOMETHING THAT WAS ADDED THIS 
YEAR AS A STATE HOLIDAY.

[Captioner] 20:51:31

IT CAME AFTER THIS CONVERSATION 


[Captioner] 20:51:35
AND THERE WAS SOME DISCUSSION.
AS FOR THE

[Captioner] 20:51:38
 FLAG, IT'S NOT JUST 
ONE THAT'S CELEBRATED BY

[Captioner] 20:51:39
 ONE 
ETHNIC GROUP.


[Captioner] 20:51:42
IT'S MULTIPLE ETHNIC GROUPS IN 
MANY PARTS OF ASIA

[Captioner] 20:51:45
.
AND THEN ALSO, FOR DIWA

[Captioner] 20:51:49
LI, I 
KNOW THAT SOME PEOPLE PERCEIVE 


[Captioner] 20:51:52
IT AND RECOGNIZE AND MY 
COUNCILMEMBERS' COMMENTS AS 


[Captioner] 20:51:55
RELIGIOUS.
BUT FOR ME I FEEL LIKE THE FOCUS 


[Captioner] 20:51:58
JUST LIKE MANY YEARS AGO WHEN WE 
TALKED ABOUT ADDING

[Captioner] 20:52:01
 LANGUAGE 
IMMERSION PROGRAMS AT THAT TIME, 


[Captioner] 20:52:04
MANY PEOPLE PUSHED BACK AND SAID 
PAINFUL AND HORRIBLE THINGS

[Captioner] 20:52:07
, 
THINGS RAISING FROM WHEN WE HAVE

[Captioner] 20:52:10
 
THREE SPANISH IMMERSION PROGRAMS

[Captioner] 20:52:14
 
AND MANDARIN, WHY DON'T PEOPLE 


[Captioner] 20:52:18
LEARN BEFORE THEY GET HERE?
TO RECOGNIZE WORLDWIDE

[Captioner] 20:52:20
 WITH THE 
OPPORTUNITY TO OVENS AND EMBRACE 


[Captioner] 20:52:24
THOSE DIFFERENT CULTURES.
I AM SUPPORTIVE OF HAVING BOTH

[Captioner] 20:52:26
 
THE CELEBRATION OF THE LUNAR NEW 


[Captioner] 20:52:29
YEAR AND ALSO DIWALI.
IF IT COMES DOWN TO COST

[Captioner] 20:52:31
 I WILL 
STEP FORWARD AND I THINK OUR 


[Captioner] 20:52:35
COUNCIL WOULD BE HAPPY TO JOIN 
ME IF WE NEEDED TO,

[Captioner] 20:52:37
 I DON'T 
THINK IT IS THAT GREAT A COST 


[Captioner] 20:52:40
AND I'D BE HAPPY TO PLEDGE TO 
FUND-RAISE FOR IT

[Captioner] 20:52:42
 AND I THINK 
FROM THE COMMUNITY WE WOULD HAVE 


[Captioner] 20:52:46
THE SUPPORT IF THAT WAS NEEDED.
BUT AT THIS POINT I'M SURE

[Captioner] 20:52:48
 THOSE 
COSTS DO NOT LOOK LIKE THEY'RE 


[Captioner] 20:52:50
FROIBTIVE.
OTHER THAN --


[Captioner] 20:52:53
>> STAFF ISN'T CONCERNED ABOUT 
THE COST.


[Captioner] 20:52:55
>> Mayor Mei:   OKAY, THAT'S WHY 
I WANTED TO CLARIFY.

[Captioner] 20:52:57

>> UNLESS OF COURSE WE CONTINUE 


[Captioner] 20:52:59
TO ADD TO THE LIST.
>> Mayor Mei:   NO.


[Captioner] 20:53:02
I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE 
NEEDED TO HAVE SOME BOUNDARIES

[Captioner] 20:53:03
 
AND UNDERSTAND TOO.


[Captioner] 20:53:07
BECAUSE IT IS A BALANCE.
WHEN YOU OPEN UP

[Captioner] 20:53:10
 AN OPPORTUNITY, 
IT'S ALMOST LIKE A LITTLE BIT OF

[Captioner] 20:53:13
 -- AND NOT THIS TYPE OF EVIL

[Captioner] 20:53:17
 
BUT PANDORA'S BOX, IT IS A GOOD

[Captioner] 20:53:20
 
THING BUT I DO ECHO JUST TO LET

[Captioner] 20:53:21
 
YOU KNOW COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL, 


[Captioner] 20:53:25
I DO LIKE THE IDEA OF DOING 
SOMETHING IN A LARGER SCALE

[Captioner] 20:53:26
 WITH 
DIFFERENT GROUPS ACROSS OUR 


[Captioner] 20:53:29
COMMUNITY AND I ENCOURAGE PEOPLE 
WHETHER IT IS THE FIRST OF ALL

[Captioner] 20:53:33
 FESTIVAL OF 
INDIA, IT

[Captioner] 20:53:36
 SHOULDN'T BE SOMETHING 
THAT IS JUST A CELEBRATION, WE 


[Captioner] 20:53:39
WILL HAVE THE FESTIVAL OF

[Captioner] 20:53:41
 INDIA 
COMING UP SOON.


[Captioner] 20:53:44
ONE OF OUR COUNCILMEMBERS TALKED 
ABOUT IT, WE ALL FLY UNDER ONE

[Captioner] 20:53:45
 
FLAG WHICH IS THE UNITED STATES 


[Captioner] 20:53:49
OF AMERICA.
AND WHY WE DO REPRESENT AND ARE 


[Captioner] 20:53:53
PROUD OF OUR OWN HERITAGE

[Captioner] 20:53:54
S WE 
ARE PROUD OF OUR OWN COUNTRY 


[Captioner] 20:53:57
ITSELF AND HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY 
TO BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER.

[Captioner] 20:53:59

LET YOU KNOW I'M SUPPORTIVE OF 


[Captioner] 20:54:03
THAT.
VICE MAYOR COX DO YOU

[Captioner] 20:54:04
 HAVE 
SOMETHING TO ADD?


[Captioner] 20:54:08
>> Vice Mayor Cox:   YES DO I.
BACK ON MARCH 21st OF THIS

[Captioner] 20:54:11
 
YEAR WE HAD A PROPOSAL FOR 


[Captioner] 20:54:14
MULTICULTURAL CELEBRATION THAT 
WAS NOT VOTED AND SUPPORTED BY 


[Captioner] 20:54:17
THE COUNTY SO THERE WAS SOME 
ACTIONS BROUGHT FORTH IN

[Captioner] 20:54:19
 GREAT 
DETAIL TO BRING OUR COMMUNITY 


[Captioner] 20:54:21
TOQUE UNDER ONE DAY OF 
CELEBRATION.


[Captioner] 20:54:24
SO I JUST WANT FOR A MATTER OF 
RECORD THAT THAT WAS

[Captioner] 20:54:26
 WRITTEN 
INTO OUR MEETING MINUTES.


[Captioner] 20:54:29
AND VOTED UPON.
AND WHEN YOU

[Captioner] 20:54:32
 TALK ABOUT 
MULTICULTURALLY, IT WAS

[Captioner] 20:54:36
 ALREADY 
RENTED AND THE COUNCIL TURNED

[Captioner] 20:54:39
 
THAT DOWN AS A MATTER OF RECORD.


[Captioner] 20:54:42
THE OTHER PART THAT I DO WANT TO 
MENTION IS THAT BY

[Captioner] 20:54:44
 DOING ALL 
MUCH THESE, YOU'RE TALKING A 


[Captioner] 20:54:47
TOTAL OF MAYBE 11 IN TOTAL WITH 
THE ADDITION

[Captioner] 20:54:51
 OF DIWAL IFG AND 
ADDITION OF

[Captioner] 20:54:54
 LUNAR NEW YEAR, 
THAT'S A TOTAL OF 11.

[Captioner] 20:54:57

EVEN WITH $700 IT'S GOING TO BE 


[Captioner] 20:55:00
LESS OVER TIME AFTER WE ACQUIRE 
AND THESE DIFFERENT GROUPS WOULD 


[Captioner] 20:55:03
BE WILLING TO STEP UP I'M SURE 
AND PARTNER WITH THE CITY

[Captioner] 20:55:04
 TO 
PROVIDE THE FLAGS.


[Captioner] 20:55:07
BUT I ALSO FEEL

[Captioner] 20:55:11
 AT THIS POINT 
THAT BY HAVING

[Captioner] 20:55:13
 I.T. ANNUALLY 
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A TOTAL OF 


[Captioner] 20:55:17
11 WHICH IS LESS THAN A YEAR OF 
THIS TYPE

[Captioner] 20:55:20
 OF OBSERVANCES, BUT 
IT'S

[Captioner] 20:55:24
 IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THAT 
EVERYONE FEELS THAT

[Captioner] 20:55:25
 THEY'RE 
BEING INCLUSIVE.


[Captioner] 20:55:28
I KNOW THERE'S GOING TO BE SOME 
THAT WE MAY NOT BE ABLE

[Captioner] 20:55:31
 TO 
ACCOMMODATE BECAUSE WE HAVE THIS 


[Captioner] 20:55:33
LIST.
BUT ALSO, FOR DISABILITY 


[Captioner] 20:55:36
EMPLOYMENT, IT SHOULD BE 
DISABILITY AWARENESS MONTH.


[Captioner] 20:55:39
THAT'S THE POLITICALLY CORRECT 
TERM, NOT

[Captioner] 20:55:43
 DISABILITY EMPLOYMENT 
FOR

[Captioner] 20:55:46
 THAT MATTER.
AND FOR THE MONTH OF MARCH IT 


[Captioner] 20:55:49
SHOULD BE OUT TO MARCH 31st, 
JUST TO MAKE

[Captioner] 20:55:51
 SOME LITTLE SLIGHT 
CORRECTIONS THERE.


[Captioner] 20:55:55
AND MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE THE 
CORRECT DATES

[Captioner] 20:55:58
 LINED UP THERE.
BUT I'M WILLING TO MAKE A

[Captioner] 20:56:01
 MOTION 
THAT WE CAN SUPPORT ALL OF THEM 


[Captioner] 20:56:06
THAT ARE PROPOSED, IN ADDITION 
TO DIWALI AND

[Captioner] 20:56:09
 LUNAR NEW YEAR TO 
BE ADDED TO THE LIST,

[Captioner] 20:56:12
 AS BEING 
ABLE TO CARRY THAT OUT ON AN

[Captioner] 20:56:14
 
ANNUAL BASIS.


[Captioner] 20:56:17
>> AS A MOTION IT'S CONSTRUCTED, 
CAN I JUST

[Captioner] 20:56:20
 POINT OUT, SO MY 
COUNT

[Captioner] 20:56:24
 IS, YOU'RE CONSIDERING 12 
EVENTS

[Captioner] 20:56:26
.
SEVERAL OF WHICH CONFLICT IN 


[Captioner] 20:56:30
THEIR DATES.
SO WOULD YOU INTEND

[Captioner] 20:56:33
 TO AUTHORIZE 
THE CITY MANAGER TO ROTATE THOSE 


[Captioner] 20:56:36
MONTHS ON A YEAR TO YEAR BASIS 
OR WOULD YOU

[Captioner] 20:56:40
 INTEND -- WELL, I

[Captioner] 20:56:41
 
GUESS THAT'S MY QUESTION.


[Captioner] 20:56:44
AS YOU THINK ABOUT THE MOTION.


[Captioner] 20:56:48
>> Vice Mayor Cox:   HOW MANY 
FLAG POLES DO WE HAVE?


[Captioner] 20:56:51
>> JUST THE ONE.
SO FOR EXAMPLE LUNAR

[Captioner] 20:56:53
 NEW YEAR 
OCCURS IN THE MONTH OF FEBRUARY 


[Captioner] 20:56:56
SO YOU'VE GOT A CONFLICT WITH 
BLACK HISTORY MONTH THERE.


[Captioner] 20:57:01
DIWALI I BELIEVE

[Captioner] 20:57:04
 IS OCCURRING IN

[Captioner] 20:57:05
 
NOVEMBER.


[Captioner] 20:57:08
OCTOBER.
>> Mayor Mei:   OCTOBER, MID 


[Captioner] 20:57:11
OCTOBER TO MID NOVEMBER USUALLY, 
THIS YEAR IT'S

[Captioner] 20:57:14
 LATE BECAUSE OF 
SOLAR

[Captioner] 20:57:17
 IT FALLS ON LUNAR NEW 
YEAR.

[Captioner] 20:57:21

>> YOU'RE GOING BETWEEN 


[Captioner] 20:57:24
DISABILITY AND NATIVE AMERICAN 
HERITAGE.


[Captioner] 20:57:27
>> AND THE CALENDARING WAS ONE 
OF THE COMPLICATIONS

[Captioner] 20:57:31
 THAT DROVE, 
I BELIEVE THAT DROVE THE

[Captioner] 20:57:35
 COUNCIL 
TO DIRECTING STAFF TO TRY AND

[Captioner] 20:57:38
 
DEVELOP CRITERIA FOR FIVE

[Captioner] 20:57:41
 EVENTS 
RATHER THAN MULTIPLE EVENTS.

[Captioner] 20:57:42

MORE THAN ADVERTISE I GUESS I 


[Captioner] 20:57:45
SHOULD SAY.
SO IF YOU WANT

[Captioner] 20:57:49
 TO ADD TO THE 
LIST WHICH

[Captioner] 20:57:52
 WE WOULDN'T BE OWNED 
TO, IT'S --

[Captioner] 20:57:54
 WHATEVER YOU GUYS 
WOULD LIKE TO DO, WHATEVER 


[Captioner] 20:57:58
POLICY YOU'D LIKE TO ESTABLISH 
PROVIDING IN YOUR MOTION SOME

[Captioner] 20:58:01
 
DIRECTION ON ADDRESSING THE

[Captioner] 20:58:03
 
OVERLAPS, WOULD BE HELPFUL AS WE 


[Captioner] 20:58:06
MOVE FORWARD.


[Captioner] 20:58:09
>> Vice Mayor Cox:   AND WHAT 
WAS THE STAFF'S SUGGESTION ON 


[Captioner] 20:58:11
THAT PART?
BECAUSE I DON'T SEE IT ON THIS 


[Captioner] 20:58:14
PART HERE.
WHAT WAS IT PREVIOUSLY?

[Captioner] 20:58:18

>> WHEN WE RECOMMENDED 


[Captioner] 20:58:21
SCHEDULING OPTIONS WITH EVENTS 
THAT CONFLICTED, WE

[Captioner] 20:58:24
 RECOMMENDED 
ALTERNATING YEARS OF OBSERVANCE.


[Captioner] 20:58:29
>> Mayor Mei:   SO THEY 
RECOMMENDED ODD AND EVEN.


[Captioner] 20:58:32
IF YOU LOOK AT OPTION NUMBER 1.
>> Vice Mayor Cox:   YES, I SEE

[Captioner] 20:58:33
 
THAT.


[Captioner] 20:58:35
>> Mayor Mei:   THAT'S WHY THEY 
HAD THAT.


[Captioner] 20:58:42
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN DID YOU 
HAVE SOMETHING TO ADD TO THAT 


[Captioner] 20:58:43
QUESTION?
>> Councilmember Salwan:   OH 


[Captioner] 20:58:47
YES, COULD YOU DO MAYBE 15 DAYS 
ONE, 15

[Captioner] 20:58:49
 DAYS ANOTHER, IS THAT 
POSSIBLE?


[Captioner] 20:58:52
>> Mayor Mei:   THAT'S WHAT I 
WAS THINKING THE WORST CASE.


[Captioner] 20:58:56
BUT HONORING -- THE QUESTION IS 
INCONSISTENCY.


[Captioner] 20:58:59
>> Councilmember Salwan:   SO 
BIG PICTURE, I THINK I SEE SIX 


[Captioner] 20:59:01
FOLKS THAT SUPPORT ADDING THOSE 
TWO EVENTS.


[Captioner] 20:59:04
THE QUESTION RIGHT NOW IS -- 
FIVE

[Captioner] 20:59:07
, I'M SORRY, YES.


[Captioner] 20:59:09
COUNCILMEMBER SHAO IS OUT.
SO FIVE.


[Captioner] 20:59:12
THE ONLY QUESTION IS, HOW MANY, 
ARE WE

[Captioner] 20:59:16
 DOING ALTERNATE, ARE WE 
DOING IT THE TWO ANNUAL EVENTS

[Captioner] 20:59:19
 
AND THE REST BIANNUAL OR ARE WE 


[Captioner] 20:59:21
DOING ALL OF THE EVENTS?
>> Councilmember Kassan:   I'M 


[Captioner] 20:59:24
SORRY I DO WANT TO ADD ONE MORE 
THING INTO THE MIX.

[Captioner] 20:59:27

IF YOU DO INSIST ON ADDING A 


[Captioner] 20:59:30
HOLIDAY THAT IS ARGUABLY 
RELIGIOUS I WOULD REALLY URGE 


[Captioner] 20:59:34
YOU TO CONSIDER ADDING RAMADAN 
AS

[Captioner] 20:59:37
 WELL.
IT FEELS REALLY UNCOMFORTABLE TO 


[Captioner] 20:59:40
ME TO NOT INCLUDES MUSLIMS IN 
THIS.


[Captioner] 20:59:43
I KNOW YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT 
SCHEDULING AND I JUST WANTED TO

[Captioner] 20:59:45
 
THROW THAT IN FOR SOMETHING FOR 


[Captioner] 20:59:48
YOUR CONSIDERATION.
>> Mayor Mei:   I THINK IDEA IS 


[Captioner] 20:59:51
STILL TO KEEP THE ARAB HERITAGE

[Captioner] 20:59:52
 
MONTH.


[Captioner] 20:59:55
SO I'M NOT SURE IF THAT IS 
SOMETHING IN LIEU OF, IS THAT

[Captioner] 20:59:58
 

[Captioner] 21:00:01
 
YOUR PROPOSAL?


[Captioner] 21:00:04
>> Councilmember Kassan:   IT 
COULD BE IN LIEU OF BUT I

[Captioner] 21:00:06
 THINK 
IF YOU ARE GOING TO CELEBRATE 


[Captioner] 21:00:09
ONE RELIGIOUS HOLIDAY YOU NEED 
TO CONSIDER

[Captioner] 21:00:13
 ONE RELIGION THAT 
HAS A BIG PRESENCE

[Captioner] 21:00:16
 HERE IN 
FREMONT BECAUSE YOU COULD

[Captioner] 21:00:18
 OFFEND 
A LOT OF PEOPLE HERE IN FREMONT 


[Captioner] 21:00:21
IF YOU DON'T.

[Captioner] 21:00:24

IF YOU WANT TO ADD A RELIGIOUS 


[Captioner] 21:00:28
HOLIDAY I'M SUGGEST YOU SHOULD 
BE

[Captioner] 21:00:30
 A LITTLE BIT INCLUSIVE.
>> Councilmember Salwan:   AND 


[Captioner] 21:00:32
YOU WOULD VOTE FOR THIS?
>> Councilmember Kassan:   I'M 


[Captioner] 21:00:36
NOT GOING TO VOTE FOR THIS NO.
>> Mayor Mei:   I CONSIDER IT A

[Captioner] 21:00:37
 
MORE CULTURAL HOLIDAY FOR ME 


[Captioner] 21:00:40
THAN RELIGIOUS BUT EVERYONE HAS 
THEIR OWN OPINION.


[Captioner] 21:00:43
AND SO COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL

[Captioner] 21:00:46
.
>> Councilmember Campbell:   


[Captioner] 21:00:49
OKAY.
I JUST WANT TO GO THROUGH A 


[Captioner] 21:00:52
PROCESS QUESTION AGAIN.
BECAUSE WE'RE LIKE ALL OVER THE

[Captioner] 21:00:53
 
MAP.


[Captioner] 21:00:55
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT WE'RE DOING, 
WHAT WE'RE SAYING.


[Captioner] 21:00:59
I DON'T THINK THAT WE'RE 
FOLLOWING THE

[Captioner] 21:01:00
 STAFF 
RECOMMENDATION THAT THEY GAVE US 


[Captioner] 21:01:03
HERE.
THEY GAVE US TWO OPTIONS ON WHAT 


[Captioner] 21:01:05
TO ROTATE.
I'M HEARING THAT WE WANT TO ADD 


[Captioner] 21:01:08
TWO MORE.
AND THEN I HEARD THAT WE WERE 


[Captioner] 21:01:12
HAVING 11 EVENTS.
BUT THE RECOMMENDATION WAS FIVE

[Captioner] 21:01:15
.
WELL NOW IF WE ADD THESE TWO IT 


[Captioner] 21:01:18
WILL BE 12.
>> Mayor Mei:   WELL ACTUALLY 


[Captioner] 21:01:22
ONE OF THE ONES I'M NOT SURE, 
I'D HAVE TO ASK CLARIFICATION

[Captioner] 21:01:25
.
YOU HAVE

[Captioner] 21:01:27
 CARIBBEAN AMERICAN 
HERITAGE MONTH.


[Captioner] 21:01:29
DO YOU KNOW WHERE THAT'S 
CELEBRATED?


[Captioner] 21:01:32
>> Councilmember Campbell:   
THAT IS NOT ON THIS LIST HERE

[Captioner] 21:01:36
.

[Captioner] 21:01:38

>> Karena Shackelford:   AGAIN, 


[Captioner] 21:01:41
THE LIST BEFORE YOU ARE MONTHS

[Captioner] 21:01:44
 
THAT ARE CELEBRATED ON THE 


[Captioner] 21:01:46
FEDERAL LEVEL.
>> Mayor Mei:   I'M NOT AWARE OF 


[Captioner] 21:01:50
US CELEBRATING HERE IN FREMONT 
NORMALLY, IF

[Captioner] 21:01:53
 WE ALREADY HAVE 
BLACK HISTORY MONTH, I'M NOT 


[Captioner] 21:01:53
SURE.
>> Councilmember Campbell:   


[Captioner] 21:01:57
THAT WOULD BRING IT DOWN TO 11.
IF EVERYBODY WOULD

[Captioner] 21:02:00
 DISAGREE TO 
TAKE OUT THE CARIBBEAN AMERICAN 


[Captioner] 21:02:04
HERITAGE MONTH.

[Captioner] 21:02:05
.
>> Vice Mayor Cox:   THAT'S 


[Captioner] 21:02:08
OPTION 1 VERSUS OPTION 2.
>> Councilmember Campbell:   


[Captioner] 21:02:10
THERE WOULD BE 11 PERIOD.
>> Vice Mayor Cox:   THEY ARE 


[Captioner] 21:02:14
NOT SAME ON THE SECOND PAGE.
>> Councilmember Campbell: 

[Captioner] 21:02:16
  
OPTION OF 1 HAS CARIBBEAN.


[Captioner] 21:02:20
THE ONE ON OPTION 2 DOES NOT 
HAVE CARIBBEAN.


[Captioner] 21:02:23
IT REPLACED IT

[Captioner] 21:02:26
 WITH --
>> Mayor Mei:   IT DIDN'T

[Captioner] 21:02:27
 
REPLACE IT.


[Captioner] 21:02:29
>> Councilmember Campbell:   I 
THINK IT -- JUST TOOK IT OUT.


[Captioner] 21:02:32
JUST TOOK IT OUT ALTOGETHER.
IT DIDN'T APPEAR

[Captioner] 21:02:35
 ON OPTION 2.
>> UNDERSTOOD.


[Captioner] 21:02:37
APOLOGIES FOR THE ERROR, 
COUNCILMEMBER.


[Captioner] 21:02:40
SO WE'LL REMOVE CARIBBEAN 
AMERICAN

[Captioner] 21:02:44
 HERITAGE MONTH AS 
YOU'RE PROPOSING IT.

[Captioner] 21:02:44

>> Councilmember Campbell:   


[Captioner] 21:02:47
THEN THAT WOULD GET US DOWN TO 
11

[Captioner] 21:02:48
 IS THAT CORRECT?
>> UH-HUH.


[Captioner] 21:02:49
>> Councilmember Campbell:   
OKAY.


[Captioner] 21:02:52
AND THEN FROM THE 11 THAT WE 
THINK THAT WE'RE OKAY WITH

[Captioner] 21:02:55
, THEN 
WE NEED TO DECIDE

[Captioner] 21:02:58
 WHETHER 
THEY'RE GOING TO BE ON A 


[Captioner] 21:03:02
ROTATION BASED ON OPTION 2, OR A 
ROTATION

[Captioner] 21:03:05
 BASED ON OPTION 1.
CORRECT

[Captioner] 21:03:09
?
>> WELL, UNFORTUNATELY,

[Captioner] 21:03:11
 THE 
OPTION 2 ROTATION NO LONGER 


[Captioner] 21:03:14
WORKS BECAUSE IF YOU ARE ADDING 
IN A LUNAR YEAR RECOGNITION YOU 


[Captioner] 21:03:17
NEED OALTERNATE WITH BLACK 
HISTORY MONTH.


[Captioner] 21:03:18
>> Councilmember Campbell:   I 
SEE.


[Captioner] 21:03:21
>> Mayor Mei:   IT VARIES 
DEPENDING ON EACH YEAR BECAUSE 


[Captioner] 21:03:24
OF THE TIMING BECAUSE IT'S 
LUNAR.


[Captioner] 21:03:26
>> SOME IN JANUARY --
>> Councilmember Campbell:   SO 


[Captioner] 21:03:29
THAT'S WHY I KIND OF I'M LEANING 
TOWARDS OPTION

[Captioner] 21:03:32
 1 BECAUSE IT DOES 
DO A YEARLY ROTATION.


[Captioner] 21:03:35
WHICH IS MORE INCLUSIVE.
SO THAT YOU GET

[Captioner] 21:03:39
 MORE FLAG 
RAISING.


[Captioner] 21:03:42
BECAUSE YOU CAN DO IT, YOU DON'T 
HAVE TO DO

[Captioner] 21:03:43
 IT WITHIN THE SAME 
MONTH.


[Captioner] 21:03:49
IF YOU DO IT, IF FOR EXAMPLE YOU 
WERE TO

[Captioner] 21:03:52
 DO BLACK HISTORY IN YEAR 
1, THEN YOU

[Captioner] 21:03:55
 DO LUNAR NEW YEAR IN 
YEAR 2.

[Captioner] 21:03:58

AND THEN 3 AND 4, ET CETERA, 


[Captioner] 21:03:59
ET CETERA.
CORRECT?


[Captioner] 21:04:02
WAS THAT YOUR -- THAT WAS YOUR 
THINKING?

[Captioner] 21:04:04

>> CORRECT.


[Captioner] 21:04:07
AND PERHAPS IT WOULD BE EASY

[Captioner] 21:04:10
IEST 
TO, IF IT'S COUNTY'S WILL TO

[Captioner] 21:04:15
 ADD 
DIWALI AND LUNAR

[Captioner] 21:04:17
 NEW YEAR AND TO 
MAINTAIN THE REST OF THE LIST 


[Captioner] 21:04:21
WITH THE EXCEPTION OF CARIBBEAN 
AMERICAN HERITAGE IF

[Captioner] 21:04:25
 COUNCIL 
SOUGHT TO

[Captioner] 21:04:28
 AUTHORIZE CITY MANAGER 
AND STAFF TO ROTATE THOSE EVENTS

[Captioner] 21:04:30
 
TO THE EXTENT THEY CONFLICT AND 


[Captioner] 21:04:33
IF THEY DON'T CONFLICT, TO 
CONDUCT THEM

[Captioner] 21:04:36
 EACH YEAR AND WE 
COULD WORK THEM OUT BEHIND THE 


[Captioner] 21:04:39
SCENES.
>> Councilmember Campbell:   I 


[Captioner] 21:04:41
WOULD BE AGREEABLE TO THAT.
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 21:04:44
COUNCILMEMBER KENG YOU HAD AND 
THEN KA

[Captioner] 21:04:47
SSAN AFTER YOU.
>> Councilmember Keng: 

[Captioner] 21:04:49
  I WAS 
GOING TO SECOND THE MOTION.


[Captioner] 21:04:52
MOTION HAD BEEN PLACED ANYWAY.
>> Councilmember Campbell:   


[Captioner] 21:04:55
WELL CAN I JUST GO AHEAD AND 
MAKE A FRINDLY AMENDMENT OR

[Captioner] 21:04:57
 
RESTATE WHAT I JUST SAID?


[Captioner] 21:04:59
>> Mayor Mei:   YES RESTATE.
>> Councilmember Campbell:   SO 


[Captioner] 21:05:02
I WOULD MAKE A MOTION TO APPROVE 
STAFF

[Captioner] 21:05:05
 RECOMMENDATION OF THE 
PROPOSED CEREMONIAL FLAG RAISING

[Captioner] 21:05:08
 
WITH THE EXCEPTION OF CARIBBEAN 


[Captioner] 21:05:11
AMERICAN HERITAGE MONTH.
IN ADDITION

[Captioner] 21:05:14
 TO ADDING DIWAL

[Captioner] 21:05:17
I AND 
LUNAR NEW YEAR WITH THE 


[Captioner] 21:05:20
DISCRETION OF ALLOWING STAFF TO 
CHOOSE

[Captioner] 21:05:22
 WHEN THESE FLAGS WOULD BE 
RAISED.


[Captioner] 21:05:26
>> Mayor Mei:   OKAY.
I HAVE A MOTION.


[Captioner] 21:05:29
DO I HAVE A SECOND?
SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER KENG

[Captioner] 21:05:30
.
OKAY.


[Captioner] 21:05:34
SO WE HAVE A MOTION AND OSECOND.


[Captioner] 21:05:36
 A 
SECOND.


[Captioner] 21:05:39
AND SO I'D LIKE TO

[Captioner] 21:05:42
 --
>> Karena Shackelford:   MAY I?


[Captioner] 21:05:45
ALLOWING STAFF THE DISCRETION TO 
DETERMINE

[Captioner] 21:05:49
 WHICH FLAGS TO RAISE 
IN THE EVENT THAT THERE'S

[Captioner] 21:05:50
 A 
DISCREPANCIES OR A CONFLICT.


[Captioner] 21:05:56
>> Mayor Mei:   I WAS GOING TO 
NOTE IN SCHEDULE 1,

[Captioner] 21:05:59
 WHICH I 
THINK MAKES SENSE IT HAS EVEN 


[Captioner] 21:06:03
YEAR AND ODD YEAR.
SO FOR EXAMPLE ASIAN AMERICAN 


[Captioner] 21:06:05
HERITAGE MONTH, RIGHT NOW IT 
SAYS EVEN.


[Captioner] 21:06:08
IS THAT SOMETHING YOU WOULD 
SPLIT BETWEEN EVEN AND ODD

[Captioner] 21:06:10
 YEAR?
BECAUSE SOME HAVE ALREADY BEEN 


[Captioner] 21:06:13
HONORED OR SOME HAVE NEVER BEEN 
HONORED OR HOW

[Captioner] 21:06:15
 WOULD YOU SPLIT 
THAT?


[Captioner] 21:06:18
WOULD YOU PROPOSE --
>> The Clerk:   I THINK

[Captioner] 21:06:21

>> Karena Shackelford:   I THINK 


[Captioner] 21:06:23
WE'RE LOOKING AT FURTHER 
DIRECTION ON THIS.


[Captioner] 21:06:26
I'M NOT SURE IF COUNCILMEMBER 
CAMPBELL

[Captioner] 21:06:29
 IS FINISHED WITH 
STATING THE MOTION BUT I THINK 


[Captioner] 21:06:32
WE'RE LOOKING FOR CLARIFICATION 
OF THE FREQUENCY OF RAISING THE

[Captioner] 21:06:33
 
FLAGS.


[Captioner] 21:06:35
>> Councilmember Campbell:   
WOULD THAT BE ON -- SO THE 


[Captioner] 21:06:39
QUESTION IS THEN WHETHER OR NOT 
OPTION 1 OR OPTION OF

[Captioner] 21:06:43
 2 IS THE 
WILL OF THE COUNCIL.


[Captioner] 21:06:46
AND ONCE WE DETERMINE THAT, 
WHETHER WE'RE GOING TO DO IT

[Captioner] 21:06:49
 ON 
ANNAL ODD AND EVEN YEAR

[Captioner] 21:06:53
 -- ON AN 
ODD AND EVEN YEAR BASIS OR

[Captioner] 21:06:55
 ARE 
WE DOING ON IT THE TWO BEING 


[Captioner] 21:06:59
ANNUAL AND EVERYTHING ELSE BEING 
BIANNUAL IS

[Captioner] 21:07:03
 THE QUESTION.
>> I THINK I HEARD ALLEN

[Captioner] 21:07:05
 SAY 
WITH THE ADDITION OF THE TWO 


[Captioner] 21:07:08
THAT YOU'VE ADDED OPTION NUMBER 
2 NO LONGER IS FEASIBLE

[Captioner] 21:07:11
.
>> THAT'S CORRECT.


[Captioner] 21:07:14
WE'RE ONLY LOOKING AT HOW TO 
RESOLVE THE CONFLICTS IN

[Captioner] 21:07:17
 THAT 
LIST THAT COUNCIL HAS NOW 


[Captioner] 21:07:18
ESTABLISHED.
>> Councilmember Campbell:   AND 


[Captioner] 21:07:21
THAT'S WHEN YOU SAID OR AT LEAST 
I HEARD YOU SAY TO ALLOW

[Captioner] 21:07:24
 THE 
STAFF TO DETERMINE THE BEST

[Captioner] 21:07:27
 WAY 
IN ORDER TO DO -- TO RESOLVE 


[Captioner] 21:07:30
THAT CONFLICT.
>> Mayor Mei:   ACTUALLY I HAVE 


[Captioner] 21:07:34
A PROMOTE ON THAT.
BECAUSE WHEN WE START

[Captioner] 21:07:37
ED SOME OF 
THESE FLAG RAISINGS, I WANT

[Captioner] 21:07:39
ED 
PEOPLE TO KNOW, WE DIDN'T RAISE 


[Captioner] 21:07:42
IT ON THE FLAG POLE BUT BEHIND 
ME ON THE

[Captioner] 21:07:45
 DAIS.
WHAT WE WOULD DO WOULD BE TO 


[Captioner] 21:07:48
SHARE.
I HATE TO SAY THAT IT DOESN'T 


[Captioner] 21:07:51
HAPPEN EVERY TIME BUT WHEN IT 
DOES HAPPEN, WE COULD RAISE ONE

[Captioner] 21:07:53
 
FOR 15 DAYS AND LEAVE THE OTHER 


[Captioner] 21:07:56
ONE HERE BEHIND THE DAIS AND 
THEREFORE WE DON'T HAVE TO HAVE 


[Captioner] 21:08:00
THIS FIGHT ABOUT THIS.
IT'S SOMETHING WE'VE DONE IN THE

[Captioner] 21:08:02
 
PAST AND THAT'S HOW WEAVER 


[Captioner] 21:08:04
HONORED OTHER PROCLAMATION 
DATES.


[Captioner] 21:08:07
THAT WOULD BE A COMPROMISE 
THAT'S EASY

[Captioner] 21:08:08
.
>> Vice Mayor Cox:   I HAVE 


[Captioner] 21:08:11
ANOTHER SUGGESTION.
I WOULD LIKE TO ADD THAT WE 


[Captioner] 21:08:14
SHOULD JUST BUY AN ADDITIONAL 
FLAG POLE.


[Captioner] 21:08:17
SO WHEN THERE IS CONFLICT YOU 
HAVE EVERYONE STILL CONCEPTUAL 


[Captioner] 21:08:20
REPRESENTED FOR THAT MONTH.
SO THAT WAY NOBODY IS CUT SHORT 


[Captioner] 21:08:23
ON THE TIME TO BE ABLE

[Captioner] 21:08:27
 TO SHARE 
IN THE

[Captioner] 21:08:30
 CELEBRATION AND 
OBSERVANCE

[Captioner] 21:08:31
 OF THE SPECIAL 
HOLIDAY.


[Captioner] 21:08:34
I THINK WE COULD BUY ONE PUT 
ANOTHER ONE UP THERE SO IF

[Captioner] 21:08:37
 WE 
HAVE CONFLICT YOU HAVE BOTH OF 


[Captioner] 21:08:40
THEM FOR THE SAME DAY FOR THE 
WHOLE MONTH AND NOT SPLIT THE 


[Captioner] 21:08:42
TIME.
BECAUSE I WOULD PEOPLE THAT IN 


[Captioner] 21:08:45
SOME CARTS IF YOU DID HALF AND 
HALF AND

[Captioner] 21:08:49
 OTHERS YOU DID

[Captioner] 21:08:55
 YOU 
WOULDN'T BE TREATING

[Captioner] 21:08:56
 EVERYONE 
ACTUALLY.


[Captioner] 21:08:59
THAT WOULD BE PART OF THE $700 
AND THEN YOU ADD ON

[Captioner] 21:09:01
 THE 
REQUISITION FOR THE FLAG POLE.


[Captioner] 21:09:04
>> Mayor Mei:   I WOULD HAVE TO 
DEFER TO THE STAFF ON THAT

[Captioner] 21:09:07
.
IF WE START THAT, I'LL FOREWARN 


[Captioner] 21:09:10
YOU, WE'VE HAD THEM IN OTHER 
CITIES WHERE THEY

[Captioner] 21:09:14
 HAD MULTIPLE 
ADDED FLAGS.

[Captioner] 21:09:15

I WANT TO GIVE YOU A CAUTION ON 


[Captioner] 21:09:17
THAT.
>> Karena Shackelford:   THAT IS 


[Captioner] 21:09:21
NOT SOMETHING I HAVE READILY 
AVAILABLE SO I COULDN'T RESPOND 


[Captioner] 21:09:24
FOR COST

[Captioner] 21:09:26
.
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado:   AND 


[Captioner] 21:09:29
FOR THE MAYOR, THERE IS A MOTION 
ON THE

[Captioner] 21:09:33
 FLOOR.
THE MOVING PARTY WOULD HAVE TO

[Captioner] 21:09:35
 
ACCEPT THAT OTHERWISE THE MOTION 


[Captioner] 21:09:39
WOULD BE AS BY THE STATED PARTY

[Captioner] 21:09:40
.
>> Vice Mayor Cox:   I WOULD 


[Captioner] 21:09:44
LIKE TO MAKE A ARE FRIENDLY 
SUBSTITUTE MOTION.

[Captioner] 21:09:45

AND THAT IS TO --


[Captioner] 21:09:47
>> Mayor Mei:   WE ALREADY HAVE 
A MOTION AND SECOND.


[Captioner] 21:09:49
>> Vice Mayor Cox:   WE DIDN'T 
ADDRESS THE PART OF HOW TO 


[Captioner] 21:09:52
HANDLE IF THERE IS MORE THAN ONE 
FLAG RAISING.


[Captioner] 21:09:55
AND YOU SAID YOU WANT TO GIVE IT 
TOUT STAFF

[Captioner] 21:09:56
.
WE'RE THE POLICY MAKERS.


[Captioner] 21:09:59
WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO SET THE 
POLICY AND PUT THAT IN THE 


[Captioner] 21:10:01
MOTION.
>> Mayor Mei:   THAT'S TRUE BUT 


[Captioner] 21:10:04
WE'RE NOT MICROMANAGING, THAT IS 
WHY WE ALREADY HAVE

[Captioner] 21:10:07
 A MOTION AND 
SECOND.


[Captioner] 21:10:09
>> Vice Mayor Cox:   BUT IT 
DOESN'T ADDRESS HOW THE STAFF IS 


[Captioner] 21:10:11
GOING TO MAKE THE DECISION WHEN 
THERE IS TWO FLAGS.


[Captioner] 21:10:15
I WOULD LIKE IT TO MAKE IT MORE 
EQUITABLE AND WOULD I LIKE TO 


[Captioner] 21:10:18
MAKE A MOTION TO BE ABLE TO 
PROPOSE THAT WE VAULT

[Captioner] 21:10:20
 THAT ARE 
LISTED IN SCHEDULE 1 BE ABLE TO 


[Captioner] 21:10:23
CELEBRATE ALL OF THEM PLUS THE 
ADDITION

[Captioner] 21:10:26
 OF DIWALI PLUS THE 
ADDITION OF

[Captioner] 21:10:29
 LUNAR NEW YEAR AND 
ALSO DIRECT THE STAFF TO BE ABLE

[Captioner] 21:10:31
 
TO PURCHASE AN ADDITIONAL FLAG 


[Captioner] 21:10:35
POLE THAT COULD BE REPRESENTED 
SO THAT EVERYONE HAS EQUAL

[Captioner] 21:10:37
 
REPRESENTATION FOR EACH MONTH.


[Captioner] 21:10:40
>> Mayor Mei:   I WOULD LIKE TO 
THEN MAKE SURE THAT THE 


[Captioner] 21:10:43
COUNCILMEMBER WHO MADE THAT 
WHETHER OR NOT SHE ACCEPTANCE

[Captioner] 21:10:46
 ACCEPTS

[Captioner] 21:10:49
 IT OR 
HAS ANY QUESTIONS ON IT

[Captioner] 21:10:50
.
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado:   WE 


[Captioner] 21:10:53
NEED TO CLARIFY THE MOTION.
ONE SECOND.


[Captioner] 21:10:56
WE HAVE A MOTION ON THE FLOOR 
AND I HEARD

[Captioner] 21:10:59
 VICE MAYOR COX USE 
THE PHRASE A FRIENDLY SUBSTITUTE 


[Captioner] 21:11:01
MOTION.
I BELIEVE AND CORRECT ME IF I'M 


[Captioner] 21:11:05
WRONG, VICE MAYOR, THAT YOU 
INTENDED TO SAY A SUBSTITUTE 


[Captioner] 21:11:08
MOTION.
IF THAT'S THE CASE,

[Captioner] 21:11:11
 THE 
SUBSTITUTED MOTION TAKES 


[Captioner] 21:11:15
PRECEDENT OVER THE ORIGINAL, 
SHOULD YOU GET A SECOND

[Captioner] 21:11:17
.
IF YOU DO NOT GET A SECOND IT 


[Captioner] 21:11:20
DIES AND WE GO BACK TO THE 
ORIGINAL MOTION ON THE FLOOR

[Captioner] 21:11:23
 PUT 
FORT BY COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL.


[Captioner] 21:11:26
FIRST WE SHOULD CLARIFY WHETHER 
YOU INTENDED TO PUT

[Captioner] 21:11:29
 FORTH A 
SUBSTITUTE MOTION OR A FRIEND

[Captioner] 21:11:31
LY 
AMENDMENT.


[Captioner] 21:11:34
>> Vice Mayor Cox:   YES, I 
INTENDED TO PUT A SUBSTITUTE 


[Captioner] 21:11:37
MOTION.


[Captioner] 21:11:40

>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado:   MAYOR 


[Captioner] 21:11:44
YOU CAN ASK IF THERE'S A SECOND.
>> Mayor Mei:   IS THERE A 


[Captioner] 21:11:46
SECOND?
>> Councilmember Salwan:   I 


[Captioner] 21:11:49
FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE MOVING THIS 
FORWARD, WHETHER THERE IS A COST 


[Captioner] 21:11:52
TO THAT.

[Captioner] 21:11:53

>> Karena Shackelford:   THAT'S 


[Captioner] 21:11:56
CORRECT, WHEN I HEART YOU 
TALKING ABOUT AN ADDITIONAL FLAG

[Captioner] 21:11:58
 
POLE, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A FLAG 


[Captioner] 21:11:59
POLE IN THE TRONT OF THE 
BUILDING.


[Captioner] 21:12:02
SO THERE ARE OBVIOUSLY SOME 
CONSTRUCTION COSTS AND ALL OF 


[Captioner] 21:12:05
THAT ASSOCIATED WITH IT.
AND I'M SORRY THAT I DON'T HAVE 


[Captioner] 21:12:08
THAT INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO ME 
AT THIS TIME.

[Captioner] 21:12:10

>> Mayor Mei:   I ALSO THINK 


[Captioner] 21:12:14
THAT IF THE MAKER OF THE MOTION, 
I MEAN WE ARE POLICY

[Captioner] 21:12:17
 MAKERS.
AND WE

[Captioner] 21:12:20
 HAVE TASKED YOU IN TERMS 
OF THE STAFF IN TERMS

[Captioner] 21:12:22
 OF THE 
OPERATIONAL AND I THINK YOU CAN 


[Captioner] 21:12:26
COME BACK, WE WILL HAVE AN 
UPDATE ON THIS AND WE CAN ASK

[Captioner] 21:12:28
 
FOR ONE AS PART OF THIS AND THAT 


[Captioner] 21:12:31
WILL ALLOW US THE TIME.
BUT IF THERE IS NOT A SECOND AT 


[Captioner] 21:12:33
THIS TIME, WE'LL RETURN TO THE 
ORM MOTION.


[Captioner] 21:12:35
WHICH IS THAT MADE BY 
COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL.


[Captioner] 21:12:42
SO WE HAVE A MOTION BY 
COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL THAT

[Captioner] 21:12:44
 
STANDS AND A SECOND BY 


[Captioner] 21:12:45
COUNCILMEMBER KENG.
COULD YOU PLEASE VOTE.


[Captioner] 21:13:00

[Captioner] 21:13:14
 VOTES -- WELL, 
THE MAJORITY OF THE COUNCIL

COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN

[Captioner] 21:13:21

[Captioner] 21:13:24

AND COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN

[Captioner] 21:13:26
 IS 
ABSENT.


[Captioner] 21:13:27
THANK YOU FOR THIS SUPPORT AND 
EFFORT.


[Captioner] 21:13:31
AND IN LIGHT OF SOME OF THE 
CONVERSATIONS WE

[Captioner] 21:13:34
 HAVE I'M SURE 
THAT STAPH CAN

[Captioner] 21:13:38
 GIVE US SOME 
FEEDBACK IN TERMS OF THE COST.


[Captioner] 21:13:41
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 21:13:47
-- I'M SURE THAT STAFF CAN GIVE 
US SOME FEEDBACK IN

[Captioner] 21:13:49
 TERMS OF THE 
COST.


[Captioner] 21:13:52
 SO AT THIS TIME I'D LIKE TO 
MOVE ON TO THE LAST ITEM WHICH

[Captioner] 21:13:55
 
IS COMMITTEE REPORTS, REPORTS

[Captioner] 21:13:57
 ON 
COMMITTEE ASSIGNMENTS.


[Captioner] 21:14:00
IF THERE'S ANY REPORTS OUT FROM 
ANY OF THE COUNCILMEMBERS FOR 


[Captioner] 21:14:03
THEIR COMMITTEE ASSIGNMENTS.


[Captioner] 21:14:10
I'LL DO A QUICK ONE WHICH IS

[Captioner] 21:14:13
 THE 
SAN JOAQUIN REGIONAL RAIL

[Captioner] 21:14:16
, WE'RE 
TALKING ABOUT CONTINUED UPDATE 


[Captioner] 21:14:19
AND OUTREACH IN TERMS OF 
ACCESSIBILITY FOR

[Captioner] 21:14:22
 BOTH DIFFERENT 
COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND OUTREACH 


[Captioner] 21:14:25
ON THE PASSES.
AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT EQUITY IN 


[Captioner] 21:14:28
ACCESS WE WANT TO MAKE SURE SOME 
OF THE THINGS WE LOOKED AT

[Captioner] 21:14:30
 WAS 
SOME OF THE MULTIPASS RIDERS AND 


[Captioner] 21:14:33
THE OPTIONS FOR THAT AND TRYING 
TO PROMOTE SOME OF THE LOCAL 


[Captioner] 21:14:36
EVENTS.
I THINK WE'VE MENTIONED EARLIER 


[Captioner] 21:14:39
TONIGHT THAT WE HAVE SOME EVENTS 
HERE LIKE OUR

[Captioner] 21:14:42
 FESTIVAL FOR ART 
AND WINE AS WELL AS OTHER ONES 


[Captioner] 21:14:45
WHERE WE WANT TO ENCOURAGE 
PEOPLE IF POSSIBLE TO TAKE 


[Captioner] 21:14:47
PUBLIC TRANSIT.
BECAUSE THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES 


[Captioner] 21:14:51
FOR THAT.
I ALSO HAD A MEETING

[Captioner] 21:14:54
 REALTY 
QUICKLY ON THE DLILT DIVIDE AND 


[Captioner] 21:14:57
TOURING THROUGH SOME OF THE 
WIRELESS

[Captioner] 21:14:59
 
WIRELESS INITIATIVES AND 


[Captioner] 21:15:02
OPPORTUNITIES WITH OTHER FELLOW 
MUNICIPALITIES SUCH

[Captioner] 21:15:06
 AS 
CUPERTINO, SANTA CLARA, SAN JOSE
