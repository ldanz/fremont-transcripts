19:10:49 STAFF IN THE CITY, WE CAN ACCOMPLISH MORE TREES PLANTED AND CARED FOR WITH

19:11:29 WELCOME, STEL LA AND ALEXA.

19:11:31 >> I LIKE TREES BECAUSE THEY MAKE OXYGEN.

19:11:36 THEY TAKE IN CARBON DIOXIDE AND PUT OUT OXYGEN.

19:11:59 COMMENTS THIS EVENING.

19:12:03 THANK YOU, AGAIN, LEONARD, FOR JOINING US.

19:12:07 >> IT HAS BEEN UPLIFTING TO WORK WITH THE YOUNG PEOPLE OF FREMONT UNDER THE 
19:12:11 LEADERSHIP OF LYNN MILLER, TRI-CITY URBAN FOREST ALLIANCE.

19:12:17 TREES GIVE US THE AIR WE BREATHE BY CHANGING THE CARBON DIOXIDE WE EXHALE 
19:12:19 FOR THE OXYGEN WE  NEED.

19:12:24 TREES IN OUR CITY PROVIDE SHADE AND COOL OUR HOT STREETS AND WALKS.

19:12:27 THEY EVEN ADD MOISTURE TO DRY AIR.

19:12:33 TREES ROOT CONVERT TOXIC MATERIALS IN THE SOIL TO ESSENTIAL MINERALS FOR ALL 
19:12:34 FORMS OF LIFE.

19:12:39 WE HAVE CUT DOWN SO MANY TREES ALL OVER THE WORLD THAT OUR OCEANS HAVE TURNED 
19:12:45 ACIDIC FROM EXCESSIVE CAR DONE BIOXIDE.

19:12:50 ARBOR DAY IS NOW PART OF THE ONE TWILL YON TREES INITIATIVE TO SAVE OUR EARTH 
19:12:52 AND THE CITY OF FREMONT SHOULD BE A PART OF THAT AS WELL.

19:12:52 THANK YOU.

19:12:59 >> Ms. Wolf: THANK YOU AGAIN FOR HAVING US ALL THIS EVENING.

19:13:02 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:13:07 AND IT'S ALWAYS LOVELY TO HEAR FROM MULTI-GENERATIONS AND ESPECIALLY 
19:13:11 INSPIRING TO HEAR FOR EARTH MONTH AND FOR ARBOR DAY FROM OUR YOUTH.

19:13:16 AND WE HOPE TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE THIS EFFORT FOR MANY YEARS TO COME, AND 
19:13:22 THANK ALL OF YOU FOR YOUR TIME, YOUR DEDICATION, AND FOR MAKING A LIVING 
19:13:25 CONTRIBUTION THAT WILL REALLY HELP US FOR GENERATIONS TO COME.

19:13:30 NEXT ON OUR AGENDA THIS EVENING IS PUBLIC COMMUNICATIONS.

19:13:36 AND THAT'S FOR ANY PERSON DESIRING TO SPEAK ON AN ITEM THAT IS NOT SCHEDULED 
19:13:38 FOR THE AGENDA THIS EVENING.

19:13:46 I SEE WITH HAVE SEVERAL  SPEAKERS.

19:14:15 AND WE'LL BEGIN -- WE'LL DO UP TO 2 MINUTES FOR EACH SPEAKER.

19:14:18 AND SO WE'LL GO AHEAD AND START WITH EACH SPEAKER.

19:14:20 WE'LL START WITH MS. DANZ.

19:14:21 WELCOME, LISA.

19:14:23 >> HI, THANK YOU.

19:14:25 THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TONIGHT.

19:14:27 I'M SPEAKING IN FAVOR OF THE SAFE PARKING PROGRAM.

19:14:31 I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO VOLUNTEER FOR THE PROGRAM SHORTLY AFTER IT KICKED 
19:14:36 OFF, AND I'M HELPING OUT WITH CHECK IN AND CHECKOUT AND I GOT TO MEET THE 
19:14:39 PARTICIPANTS AS WELL AS SEVERAL MEMBERS OF THE HOSTING CHURCH AND THEY WERE 
19:14:40 ALL WONDERFUL PEOPLE.

19:14:44 ONE THING THAT REALLY STUCK OUT AT ME WAS HOW MUCH THE PARTICIPANTS TOOK 
19:14:45 RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE SUCCESS OF THE PROGRAM.

19:14:49 FOR EXAMPLE, THEY WERE IN CHARGE OF MAKING SURE THAT THEIR PORT-A-POTTY 
19:14:52 WAS LOCKED WHEN NOT IN USE AND THEY REALLY TOOK THAT SERIOUSLY.

19:14:58 THEY PRO ACTIVELY RAISED CONCERNS IF THEY SAW OTHER PEOPLE USING IT.

19:15:02 THE CHECKOUT PRESURE MADE IT EASY FOR THE VOLUNTEERS DOING THEIR JOB.

19:15:08 IT SHOWED THEY WERE TAKING OWNERSHIP TO MAKE IT AS SUCCESSFUL AS POSSIBLE.

19:15:10 THIS IS JUST THE FIRST STEP.

19:15:16 I URGE THE CITY COUNCIL TO KEEP GOING AND ENTER THE SECOND PRONG OF THREE 
19:15:18 PRONGS PRESENTED BY STAFF IN FEBRUARY 2021.

19:15:23 AS A REMINDER, THOSE TWO  REMAINING PRONGS ARE THE SANCTIONED PARKING 
19:15:27 PROGRAM TO MEET PEOPLE WHERE THEY ARE AND PROVIDE RESTROOMS AND DUMPSTERS AS 
19:15:31 WELL AS THE SPHI OPERATED SITE WITH COMPREHENSIVE WRAP AROUND VUFS.

19:15:35 THOS REMAINING PRONGS WOULD HELP COMMUNITY MEMBERS CURRENTLY LEFT OUT 
19:15:39 OF THE PROGRAM WHO INCLUDES PEOPLE THAT WORK NIGHT SHIFT THAT NEED A SAFE 
19:15:46 PLACE TO PARK DURING THE DAY, THOSE WITH  RVs, CHILDREN AND SO FORTH.

19:15:48 PLEASE EXPAND SAFE PARKING IN FREMONT.

19:15:48 THANK YOU.

19:15:49 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:15:52 THE NEXT SPEAKER IS MARIE H, MARIE HUGHES.

19:15:53 WELCOME.

19:16:00 >> MY NAME IS MARIE HUGHES, AND I SPEAK TODAY AS A MEMBER OF THE FREMONT FOR 
19:16:04 EVERYONE LEADERSHIP TEAM, BUT ALSO AS SOMEONE WHO LIVES WITHIN A 1-MILE 
19:16:08 RADIUS OF THE NILES SAFE PARKING SITE, AND I USED TO LIVE ACROSS THE STREET 
19:16:13 FROM CHRIST THE KING LUTHERAN CHURCH, WHICH IS THIS MONTH'S SITE.

19:16:17 I AM IN SUPPORT OF THE CURRENT SAFE PARKING PROGRAM AND THE PROPOSED 
19:16:17 CITYWIDE PROGRAM.

19:16:22 WHEN THE SAFE PARKING PROGRAM WAS IN NILES, IT DID NOT DISRUPT LIFE IN 
19:16:22 NILES IN ANY WAY.

19:16:26 THERE ARE MANY HOMELESS PEOPLE LIVING IN NILES INCLUDING THOSE WHO LIVE IN 
19:16:27 THE ROUGH.

19:16:31 THEY DID NOT DESCEND ON THE CHURCH AND PITCH THEIR TENTS IN THE NEARBY FIELD.

19:16:34 THE PEOPLE IN THE PROGRAM DIDN'T WANDER THROUGH THE NEIGHBORHOODS EVERY 
19:16:35 MORNING AT 7:00 A.M.

19:16:39 THEY DIDN'T CAUSE TRAFFIC SNARLS WHEN THEY WERE COMING AND GOING.

19:16:41 NOTHING BAD THAT WAS PREDICTED HAPPENED.

19:16:45 SOMEONE DID GET OUT OF THE PROGRAM AND INTO PERMANENT HOUSING, THOUGH.

19:16:47 THAT IS BECAUSE SAFE PARKING IS SAFE.

19:16:50 THE HOMELESS POPULATION IS VARIED.

19:16:54 MANY ARE WORKING POOR, SENIORS ON A FIXED INCOME, STUDENTS, FAMILIES.

19:17:03 ALL OF WHOM HAVE BEEN PRICED OUT OF THEIR LIVING SITUATION BUT WHO HAVE A 
19:17:03 CAR.

19:17:05 FREMONT'S PARKING PROGRAM IS PERFECT FOR THEM.

19:17:09 IT GIVES THEM A PLACE TO WASH UP AT NIGHT SO THEY DON'T GO TO WORK OR 
19:17:13 SCHOOL SMELLY, FOR THE KIDS TO DO THEIR HOMEWORK SO THEY DON'T FALL BEHIND AT 
19:17:16 SCHOOL AND TO SLEEP WITHOUT FEAR OF BEING A VICTIM OF CRIME.

19:17:20 FOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T PAY ATTENTION, MAYBE THEY THINK SAFE PARKING IS GOING 
19:17:23 TO BRING AN INFLUX OF HOMELESS PEOPLE TO THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS.

19:17:26 WHAT THEY DON'T REALIZE IS THAT PEOPLE ARE ALREADY IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS, 
19:17:27 LIVING IN THEIR CARS.

19:17:31 THE REASON THEY DON'T REALIZE THIS IS BECAUSE THESE PEOPLE AREN'T BOTHERING 
19:17:31 ANYONE.

19:17:33 BUT THEY AREN'T SAFE OUT THERE.

19:17:36 THEY AREN'T IN A STABLE ENVIRONMENT, AND THEY CAN'T CONCENTRATE ON FINDING 
19:17:37 PERMANENT HOUSING.

19:17:40 THESE ARE REAL PEOPLE.

19:17:42 THESE ARE OUR NEIGHBORS, AND THEY NEED THIS PROGRAM.

19:17:46 PLEASE KEEP IT GOING, AND PLEASE START THE PROCESS OF PICKING A SITE FOR A 
19:17:49 LARGER PERMANENT  CITY-SPONSORED PROGRAM.

19:17:49 THANK YOU.

19:17:53 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:18:06 THE NEXT SPEAKER IS  GOPALAKRISHNAN PADMA.

19:18:09 >> I'M HERE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AS WELL AS THE 
19:18:12 CITY'S LACK OF ALIGNMENT WITH THE PRIORITIES OF THE RESIDENTS.

19:18:18 SO THERE IS A LACK OF COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT WE RARELY HEAR ABOUT THINGS 
19:18:23 COMING UP, PARTICULARLY REALLY BIG ITEMS SUCH AS HOMEKEY OR WITH THE 
19:18:24 VISION ZERO, WHAT THE ACTUAL DETAILS ARE.

19:18:31 THE COMMUNICATION WE GET IS VERY GENERAL WITH SOUNDS ALL ROSIE AND 
19:18:32 THERE IS A LACK OF DETAIL BEHIND IT.

19:18:37 PLEASE REMEMBER THERE HAS BEEN NO CITY OF FREMONT SERVICE SINCE 2018 AND I 
19:18:38 FAIL TO UNDERSTAND WHY THAT IS THE CASE.

19:18:41 WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR TO CONDUCT A SURVEY?

19:18:45 THIRD, WHEN THERE IS NO SURVEY, HOW DID THE CITY THIS YEAR CHANGE ITS TOP 
19:18:45 PRIORITIES?

19:18:49 WHAT KIND OF INPUT DID IT TAKE FROM THE RESIDENTS?

19:18:53 WAS THERE JUST, YOU KNOW, THROWING A DART AT THE WALL TO PICK WHAT THE TOP 
19:18:53 PRIORITIES WERE?

19:18:58 AND HOW IS IT THAT THEY ARE  MISALIGNED WITH ALL OF THE PREVIOUS SERVICE THAT 
19:19:00 HAS BEEN DONE WITH THE RESIDENTS?

19:19:07 NEXT, THESE BULBOUTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE ON THE ROAD, EXTREMELY UNPOPULAR 
19:19:12 AMONG A WIDE SECTION OF PEOPLE AND IT IS NOT SOLVING ANY MAJOR PROBLEMS BUT 
19:19:18 IS CREATING TRAFFIC CONGESTION, IT IS CREATING POLLUTION, AND IT IS SLOWING 
19:19:21 DOWN PEOPLE AND EVEN WHO ARE WELL WITHIN THE SPEED LIMIT.

19:19:27 SO PLEASE STOP ANY MORE BULBOUTS IN FREMONT, AND WE NEED TO KNOW WHERE THE 
19:19:31 NEXT BULB-OUTS ARE SO THAT WE CAN SPEAK UP BECAUSE THESE ARE REALLY HURTING 
19:19:31 US.

19:19:39 THE BART IRVINGTON IS NOT COMING OUT UNTIL 2031.

19:19:43 WHY THE BULBOUTS AT WASHINGTON INTERSECTION CREATING HAVOC FOR THOSE 
19:19:45 OF US WHO NEED TO EARN A LIVING AND SUPPORT OUR FAMILY?

19:19:50 NEXT, THE $40 MILLION BRIDGE FROM THIS IRVINGTON BART THAT WE DON'T EVEN 
19:19:53 NEED, WE HAVE A BART STATION AT WARM SPRINGS, WE REALLY DON'T WANT ONE IN 
19:19:54 IRVINGTON.

19:19:57 WE ARE GOING TO GET A BART STATION WHETHER OR NOT WE WANT IT, WE ARE 
19:20:01 GOING TO SPEND $40 MILLION ON A WALK BRIDGE.

19:20:05 I'D LIKE TO KNOW IF THERE WILL BE EVEN 40 OHLONE COLLEGE STUDENTS WHO WILL 
19:20:07 USE THE BART AND THIS WALK BRIDGE TO GET TO OHLONE.

19:20:10 DID WE EVERY COLLECT --

19:20:11 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:20:14 THE NEXT SPEAKER IS IRIS ANY  KOLSON.

19:20:17   NICHOLSON.

19:20:21 IRIS, PLEASE UNMUTE YOURSELF.

19:20:26 >> GOOD EVENING, MAYOR, COUNCILMEMBERS AND CITY STAFF.

19:20:30 I AM SPEAKING IN SUPPORT OF THE SAFE PARKING PROGRAM.

19:20:35 I VOLUNTEERED FOR THE SAFE PARKING PROGRAM AT THE CHURCH WHERE I AM A 
19:20:35 MEMBER.

19:20:39 WE HAVE A SMALL GROUP OF PEOPLE SLEEPING IN THEIR CARS OVERNIGHT IN 
19:20:41 THE CHURCH PARKING LOT FOR THE MONTH OF MARCH.

19:20:45 THE PROGRAM ACCOMMODATED JUST A FEW CARS.

19:20:48 CHURCH MEMBERS CHECKED ON GUEST PARKERS EACH EVENING AND MORNING.

19:20:53 TWO MORNINGS A WEEK, I WAS ON SITE, CHECKED ON GUESTS, DISTRIBUTED THE BAG 
19:20:58 BREAKFAST THAT THE CHURCH PROVIDED, AND BAG LUNCHES FROM TRI-CITY VOLUNTEERS.

19:20:59 MY EXPERIENCE?

19:21:01 THE PROGRAM IS WELL ORGANIZED.

19:21:05 ALL THE PARKING GUESTS ARE ENROLLED IN HOUSING ASSISTANCE PROGRAM, AND EACH 
19:21:06 HAS A CASE MANAGER.

19:21:11 THE CITY OF FREMONT PROVIDED PORTABLE TOILETS AND EXTRA GARBAGE SERVICES.

19:21:18 WE, GUESTS AND HOSTS ALIKE, ALL HAD EMERGENCY NUMBERS, SO WE COULD SECURE 
19:21:19 ASSISTANCE WHENEVER IT WAS NEEDED.

19:21:25 EACH PERSON HAD A UNIQUE REASON THAT MADE THE SAFE PARKING OPTION USEFUL 
19:21:25 FOR THEM.

19:21:29 ONE PERSON PARKED WITH US ON THE DAYS SHE COULD NOT STAY WITH FAMILY.

19:21:34 ANOTHER PERSON WAS WAITING FOR APPROVAL ON AN APARTMENT IN THE TRI-CITIES.

19:21:39 STILL ANOTHER COUPLE WORKED SWING SHIFT AND THEY WERE SLEEPING IN THEIR CAR TO 
19:21:39 SAVE MONEY.

19:21:46 SAFE PARKING IN A CHURCH PARKING LOT PROVIDES A TEMPORARY ANSWER FOR PEOPLE 
19:21:49 WHO DON'T HAVE A  HOME, BUT DO HAVE A CAR TO SLEEP IN.

19:21:51 IT'S MUCH SAFER.

19:21:56 IN CLOSING, I WANT TO THANK THE COUNCIL FOR MAKING HOUSING ASSISTANCE A 
19:21:56 PRIORITY.

19:22:00 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:22:05 THE NEXT SPEAKER IS JOHN HINDS.

19:22:05 WELCOME.

19:22:12 >> HELLO, EVERYONE.

19:22:15 SPEAKING UP AGAIN HERE ON THE SUBJECT OF LOCAL CONTROL.

19:22:20 WHEN YOU RUN FOR OFFICE IN A LOCAL GOVERNMENT, YOU SORT OF PRESUME THAT 
19:22:25 YOU HAVE THE WISDOM TO EXERCISE THE POWERS OF THAT JOB WELL AND 
19:22:26 RESPONSIBLY.

19:22:31 IF SOMEONE WERE TO CAMPAIGN FOR THAT OFFICE AND THEN SUGGEST THAT THE STATE 
19:22:35 SHOULD TAKE AWAY THOSE POWERS BECAUSE WE CAN'T REALLY HANDLE THEM AFTER ALL, 
19:22:37 THAT WOULD BE A STRANGE THING TO DO.

19:22:46 IT WOULD BE LIKE GOING FROM THESE JOBS ARE IMPORTANT TO THEY SHOULD BE 
19:22:53 TOOPLESS AND IT WOULD NOT BE AN EASY STORY TO EXPLAIN TO LOCAL VOTERS WHEN 
19:22:54 YOU WANT THEIR LOCAL VOTES.

19:22:58 BY THE WAY, TWO MEMBERS OF OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENT ARE CURRENTLY RUNNING FOR 
19:22:59 STATE GOVERNMENT.

19:23:04 WHEN THEY GET THERE, I REALLY HOPE THEY REMEMBER THE IMPORTANCE OF LOCAL 
19:23:05 CONTROL.

19:23:06 THANK YOU.

19:23:12 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU,  MR. HINDS.

19:23:15 THE NEXT SPEAKER IS MARILYN ZINGER.

19:23:19   SINGER.

19:23:22 MARILYN, COULD YOU PLEASE UNMUTE YOURSELF?

19:23:41 WE'LL SKIP MS. SINGER FOR NOW AND WE'LL GO TO BLAIR BEEKMAN.

19:23:42 WE'LL COME BACK.

19:23:43 WELCOME, MR. BEEKMAN.

19:23:45 >> BLAIR BEEKMAN HERE.

19:23:47 THANKS FOR THE MEETING TONIGHT.

19:23:53 I'M SORRY IF LAST WEEK MY ZOOM LINK WAS A BIT SHAKY.

19:23:57 IT MIGHT BE TONIGHT AS WELL, NOT AS SHAKY BUT SHAKY STILL.

19:23:58 SORRY ABOUT THAT.

19:24:03 I HAD A FEW QUESTIONS.

19:24:09 I'M HOPING THAT THE ITEM ON THE FUTURE OF MILITARY USE HARDWARE FOR THE 
19:24:13 POLICE DEPARTMENT, IT WILL STILL BE A REGULAR AGENDA ITEM AND HAS NOT BEEN 
19:24:15 MOVED TO CONSENT?

19:24:20 IS THERE A WAY I CAN ASK AND THAT I CAN GET A QUICK RESPONSE ON THAT QUESTION 
19:24:20 RIGHT NOW?

19:24:24 >> Mayor Mei: YOU SHOULD WAIT TO SPEAK ON THAT AS AN AGENDIZED ITEM THIS 
19:24:25 EVENING.

19:24:25 >> GREAT.

19:24:25 THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

19:24:26 OKAY.

19:24:27 GOOD TO KNOW.

19:24:30 SO I JUST -- TO CONCLUDE REALLY QUICKLY, I JUST WANTED TO TAKE THIS 
19:24:37 TIME TO REMIND OF THE IMPORTANCE OF SURVEILLANCE AND TECHNOLOGY ORDINANCE 
19:24:39 IDEAS, AND I'LL BRING THIS UP AT THE ITEM.

19:24:47 YEAH, I WILL CHANGE GEARS AND TRY TO JUST OFFER THE SIMPLE REMINDERS OF THE 
19:24:51 IMPORTANCE  OF -- BECAUSE OF THE AIR OF COVID THAT WE'RE IN RIGHT NOW, WE'RE 
19:24:59 IN A NEW REALM OF SUBSIDY USE AT THE STATE LEVEL.

19:25:03 THEY'VE DEVELOPED SOME REALLY IMPORTANT NEW FUNDING PATTERNS AND WE'LL BE 
19:25:10 GETTING IMPORTANT MONEY IN OUR FUTURE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL THAT CAN WORK VERY 
19:25:14 WELL FOR THE FUTURE OF SUBSIDY PROGRAMS THEMSELVES FOR HOUSING, LOW INCOME 
19:25:14 HOUSING.

19:25:15 WE ALREADY HAVE GOOD PRACTICES.

19:25:21 WHAT I SAID LAST WEEK, WHAT I TRIED TO SAY, WE CAN REALLY EMPLOY THOSE GOOD 
19:25:24 SUBSIDY THINGS AT THE STATE LEVEL, AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AT THIS TIME.

19:25:28 AND IT TAKES PRACTICE TO LEARN HOW TO TALK THAT WAY TO EACH OTHER.

19:25:32 GOOD LUCK IN THOSE EFFORTS, HOW WE CAN DO THAT WITH EACH OTHER AS A 
19:25:33 COMMUNITY.

19:25:39 AND A QUICK REMINDER THAT -- YEAH, I GUESS THAT SHOULD BE ABOUT ALL FOR NOW.

19:25:39 THANK YOU.

19:25:41 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:25:46 THE NEXT SPEAKER, WE'LL RETURN TO MARILYN SINGER, IF SHE'S AVAILABLE TO 
19:25:46 UNMUTE.

19:25:51 >>  HELLO.

19:25:53 THIS IS MARILYN SINGER.

19:25:56 I'M A MEMBER OF THE NILES DISCOVERY CHURCH WHERE THE SAFE PARKING WAS 
19:25:57 HOUSED FOR THE MONTH OF MARCH.

19:26:01 WE HAD ABSOLUTELY NO PROBLEMS WITH THE PROGRAM.

19:26:06 I PERSONALLY DELIVERED BREAKFAST TO THE PARTICIPANTS EVERY FRIDAY MORNING AND 
19:26:10 ALSO GAVE THEM A PREPARED LUNCH BAG OF NUTRITIOUS NON-PERISHABLE ITEMS.

19:26:15 THIS TASK WAS DONE BY A MEMBER OF NILES DISCOVERY EVERY DAY OF THE WEEK, AND 
19:26:20 WE HAD NOTHING BUT GRATEFUL PEOPLE AND FRIENDLY FACES WHEN WE ARRIVED THERE 
19:26:20 AT 8:00 IN THE MORNING.

19:26:25 OUR PARKING LOT WAS ALWAYS QUIET AND ORDERLY.

19:26:29 NAVIGATORS WERE WORKING WITH SOME OF THE PARTICIPANTS, WORKING WITH THEM TO 
19:26:31 FIND MORE PERMANENT HOUSING SOLUTIONS.

19:26:36 THEY WATCHED OVER OUR PARKING LOT, THEY KEPT THE VANDALS, WHICH OCCASIONALLY 
19:26:41 COME TO  NILES, AWAY FROM OUR LOT.

19:26:45 THEY MADE US SECURE AND NILES DISCOVERY LOOKS FORWARD TO TAKING OUR PLACE 
19:26:46 AGAIN IN THE SAFE PARKING ROTATION.

19:26:47 THANK YOU.

19:26:48 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:26:50 FOR SHARING.

19:26:53 NEXT SPEAKER IS STEVE SKALA.

19:26:55 WELCOME, STEVE.

19:27:00 >> THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR, CITY COUNCIL.

19:27:12 FREQUENTLY IN THIS AGENDA ITEM, WE HEAR COMMENTS THAT ARE NEGATIVE TOWARDS 
19:27:18 VISION ZERO, TO TAKE ACTION AGAINST RIGHT TURNS, BULBOUTS.

19:27:22 THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF THOSE PROTECTED INTERSECTIONS WAS CALLED FOR IN THE 
19:27:27 PEDESTRIAN MASTER PLAN OVER FIVE YEARS AGO IN RESPONSE TO RISING COLLISION 
19:27:29 RATES.

19:27:32 WE CAN LOOK TO OUR SOUTH IN SAN JOSÉ WHERE YOU CAN BARELY GO A WEEK OF 
19:27:36 READING THE MERCURY NEWS WITHOUT READING OF ANOTHER TRAFFIC FATALITY OR 
19:27:41 PEDESTRIAN FATALITY AND THEY'RE ON TRACK TO SMASH THEIR RECORDS FOR 
19:27:43 TRAFFIC FATALITIES.

19:27:48 IF WE HAD THE SAME RATES OF COLLISION AND FATALITIES IN FREMONT, WE WOULD 
19:27:53 HAVE ABOUT HALF A DOZEN TRAFFIC FATALITIES, THREE OR FOUR PEDESTRIAN 
19:27:54 FATALITIES.

19:27:56 TO DATE, WE HAVE NONE.

19:27:58 THAT IS VISION ZERO.

19:28:01 THAT'S WHY THE PLAN WAS IMPLEMENTED.

19:28:02 YEARS AGO, THAT WASN'T THE CASE.

19:28:04 WE DID HAVE FATALITIES.

19:28:10 WE USED TO RECEIVE MANY COMMENTS IN CITY COUNCIL MEETING ASKING COUNCIL TO 
19:28:14 DO SOMETHING TO HELP PREVENT FURTHER TRAGEDIES LIKE WE'VE HAD IN THE PAST.

19:28:22 SO I HOPE WE KEEP THAT IN MIND, AND CONSIDER THE TIMES OF COMMENTS THAT 
19:28:26 WE'D RATHER RECEIVE OR NOT RECEIVE DURING THIS PERIOD OF THE AGENDA ITEM.

19:28:26 THANK YOU.

19:28:30 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU, STEVE.

19:28:34 THE NEXT SPEAKER IS SALONI  PATEL.

19:28:37 WELCOME.

19:28:41 >> GOOD EVENING, EVERYONE.

19:28:43 I GO TO IRVINGTON HIGH SCHOOL.

19:28:49 TODAY I'M HERE TO TALK ABOUT THE BAPS CHARITIES COVID RELIEF EFFORTS.

19:28:53 IT'S A GLOBAL CHARITY ACTIVE IN NINE COUNTRIES ACROSS FIVE CONTINENTS 
19:28:57 COMMITTED TO COMMUNITY SERVICE, EDUCATION SERVICE, HEALTH AND 
19:29:00 WELLNESS, ENVIRONMENTAL INITIATIVES AND HUMANITARIAN RELIEF.

19:29:05 VOLUNTEERS DRIVE OUR EFFORTS, INCLUDING THE ANNUAL WALKATHON DEDICATING A 
19:29:10 PORTION OF THEIR LIVES TO SOUTHWEST SERVICE OF OTHERS IN BOTH LOCAL 
19:29:11 NEIGHBORHOODS AS WELL AS GLOBALLY.

19:29:18 THE BAPS CHARITIES WALKATHON IS A NATIONAL EVENT THAT TAKES PLACE WITH 
19:29:21 OVER 23,000 PARTICIPANTS WITH BENEFICIARIES THAT HAVE INCLUDED THE 
19:29:24 AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION AND IN KEEPING WITH ITS ENVIRONMENTAL 
19:29:31 INITIATIVES AND NATURE CONSERVANCY, THE BAPS CHARITIES WALKATHON HAS HELPED A 
19:29:34 NATURE CONSERVANCY PLANT TREES.

19:29:39 IN THE BAY AREA, THE MILL PEE TAS CHAPTER OF BAPS CHARITIES HAS BEEN 
19:29:43 ORGANIZING FOR OVER 18 YEARS TO SUPPORT THE LOCAL SCHOOLS, LAW ENFORCEMENT 
19:29:48 CIVIC ACTIVITIES, HOSPITALS, HEALTH ORGANIZATIONS AND CONSERVATION GROUPS, 
19:29:53 AS WELL AS BENEFICIARIES SUCH AS THE SOUTH ASIAN HEART CENTER, MILIPITAS 
19:29:55 UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT AND THE SILICON VALLEY EDUCATION FOUNDATION.

19:30:01 DURING THE ONGOING PANDEMIC, THEY RECOGNIZE MANY CAUSES NEED FUNDS TO 
19:30:02 KEEP GOING.

19:30:07 AND THIS YEAR'S BENEFICIARY IS THE SUSAN G. KOMEN FOUNDATION, THE WORLD'S 
19:30:10 LARGEST NON-PROFIT SOURCE FOR FUNDING AGAINST THE FIGHT AGAINST BREAST 
19:30:10 CANCER.

19:30:14 THIS YEAR'S WALKATHON WILL BE HOSTED AT LAKE ELIZABETH PARK IN FREMONT ON 
19:30:15 SATURDAY, APRIL 30TH.

19:30:21 THIS EVENT IS OPEN TO EVERYONE AND HENCE I WOULD LIKE TO INVITE EVERYONE 
19:30:21 FROM THE CITY TO JOIN US.

19:30:27 TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT THIS  WALKATHON, PLEASE VISIT  WWW.BAPSCHARITIES.ORG.

19:30:30 IN CONCLUSION, I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE OFFICES OF THE FREMONT CITY FOR 
19:30:37 ALLOWING ME TO SHARE THIS INFORMATION WITH YOU ABOUT THE BAPS WALKATHON.

19:30:37 THANK YOU.

19:30:38 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU FOR  THAT.

19:30:45 AND I KNOW LAST YEAR IT WAS A MILLION STEPS SO EVERY YEAR THEY HAVE A 
19:30:45 DIFFERENT THEME.

19:30:46 THAT'S WONDERFUL.

19:30:55 NEXT SPEAKER WILL BE PURUSHOTHAM PEDDIREDDY.

19:30:56 MY APOLOGIES.

19:30:57 >> NO PROBLEM.

19:31:02 GOOD EVENING, CITY MAYOR AND COUNCIL MEMO WE ARES.

19:31:06  COUNCILMEMBERS.

19:31:13 IN OCTOBER WE SUBMITTED A PETITION IN RESPONSE TO THE CITY'S IMPLEMENTATION 
19:31:20 OF A BIKE LANE ON THE PASEO PADRE PARKWAY BETWEEN WASHINGTON AND --.

19:31:27 THE PETITION WAS HOW UNSAFE IT WAS AND HOW IT MADE EVEN  UNSAFER.

19:31:30 AND --

19:31:32 >> Councilmember Kassan: I'M SORRY, THIS ITEM IS ON THE AGENDA.

19:31:34 >> Mayor Mei: YES, I WAS ACTUALLY GOING TO SPEAK UP.

19:31:38 SO IF IT'S AN AGENDIZED ITEM, YOU WOULD SPEAK UNDER THAT AGENDA, SIR.

19:31:47 SO I'LL BE HAPPY TO BRING YOU BACK -- SO I'D BE HAPPY TO BRING YOU BACK AT 
19:31:47 THAT SAID TIME.

19:31:54 SO JUST TO CLARIFY, IF AN ITEM IS NOT AGENDIZED, IT'S ADDRESSED UNDER THE 
19:31:59 PUBLIC COMMENT, AND FOR THOSE WHO ARE SPEAKING ON AN AGENDIZED ITEM THIS 
19:32:03 EVENING, THEY WILL BE COVERED UNDER -- AT THAT TIME FOR PUBLIC COMMENT.

19:32:16 MANJUNATH SHANKAR, ARE YOU SPEAKING ON AN AGENDIZED ITEM THIS EVENING?

19:32:17 >> NO, MISS MAYOR.

19:32:20 GOOD EVENING, HONORABLE MAYOR AND CITY COUNCILMEMBERS.

19:32:25 AS A RESIDENT LIVING IN FREMONT FOR THE LAST 10 YEARS, I WOULD LIKE TO BRING 
19:32:31 TO ATTENTION THE LACK OF DATA POST CHANGES DONE IN FREMONT WITH RESPECT 
19:32:36 TO VISION ZERO SUCH AS LANE REDUCTIONS, STRIPING AND FURTHERMORE THE LATEST 
19:32:37 ONE, THE BULBOUTS.

19:32:42 THE CITY COUNCIL AND THE RESIDENTS WERE VERY WELCOMING OF THIS VISION AND 
19:32:44 APPROVED THE CHANGES VERY POSITIVELY.

19:32:50 IT IS TRULY A PROGRESSIVE CITY COUNCIL AND I COMMEND YOUR EFFORTS FOR THIS.

19:32:56 HOWEVER, THIS SEEMS TO HAVE INTRODUCED MORE ISSUES FOR THE RESIDENTS AND HAVE 
19:33:00 BEEN VERY POORLY RECEIVED ACROSS THE BOARD TO MANY RESIDENTS THAT I'VE 
19:33:01 SPOKEN TO.

19:33:06 GIVEN THESE CHANGES WERE MADE AFTER PRESENTING DATA FOR THE LAST FIVE 
19:33:10 YEARS WHEN THEY WERE DONE, WE HAVE HAD FIVE YEARS TO ANALYZE THESE CHANGES 
19:33:13 AND TO GET DATA ON THOSE.

19:33:19  BEFORE MORE OF THESE ARE APPROVE AND MORE CHANGES ARE MADE TO THE STREETS 
19:33:20 OF THE CITY OF FREMONT.

19:33:27 THEY SHOULD NOT BE DONE SOLELY BY SURVEYS AND OPINIONS, BUT -- BECAUSE 
19:33:31 THEY'RE GOING TO PROVIDE A VERY SMALL SAMPLE SET AND CAN BE EXTREMELY 
19:33:34 MISLEADING, THE NUMBERS CAN ALSO BE PORTRAYED IN A VARIETY OF WAYS THAT 
19:33:38 CAN BE MISLEADING TO THE CITY COUNCIL AS WELL AND I'VE SUBMITTED SOME OF MY 
19:33:39 FLAINTS TOWARDS THOSE AS WELL.

19:33:46 SO PLEASE DO CONSIDER GATHERING MORE DATA WHICH SHOWCASE THE PREMISE WITH 
19:33:50 WHICH THESE CHANGES WERE DONE BEFORE WE GO AHEAD AND START MAKING MORE CHANGES 
19:33:52 TO THE STREETS OF FREMONT.

19:33:54 THANK YOU.

19:33:56 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:33:58 THAT WAS THE LAST OF THE PUBLIC COMMENTS.

19:34:02 I WILL CLOSE THE PUBLIC COMMENT AND WE WILL RETURN FOR OUR REGULARLY 
19:34:04 SCHEDULED AGENDIZED ITEMS THIS EVENING.

19:34:10 AND THE FIRST ONE IS THE MILITARY EQUIPMENT USE POLICY.

19:34:14 AND I BELIEVE WE HAVE A PRESENTATION AVAILABLE.

19:34:21 AND I'D LIKE TO WELCOME POLICE CHIEF SEAN WASHINGTON AND POLICE CAPTAIN 
19:34:24 MATTHEW NELSON, WHO ARE JOINING US THIS EVENING AND ARE AVAILABLE TO ANSWER 
19:34:24 QUESTIONS.

19:34:31 WELCOME, CHIEF.

19:34:32 HOW ARE YOU THIS EVENING?

19:34:40 >> THANK YOU, MAYOR, COUNCILMEMBERS, AND MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC AND I WILL 
19:34:41 ATTEMPT TO SHARE MY SCREEN FOR THE PRESENTATION.

19:35:00 IS THAT COMING ACROSS?

19:35:05 >> Mayor Mei: IT IS COMING ACROSS BUT IT IS SHOWING AT THE BOTTOM OF YOUR 
19:35:08 PRESENTATION, SO IF YOU SCROLL TO THE TOP OF THE SLIDE DECK AND PRESS THE 
19:35:15 SLIDE SHOW OPTION UNDER -- THERE, I BELIEVE.

19:35:15 THANK YOU.

19:35:21 PERFECT.

19:35:22 >> ALL RIGHT.

19:35:28 WELL, THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL 481, WHICH HAS 
19:35:34 TO DO WITH IDENTIFYING LAW ENFORCEMENT MILITARY EQUIPMENT AS DEFINED BY THE 
19:35:34 LAW.

19:35:41 SO I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE THIS INFORMATION WITH ALL OF YOU 
19:35:41 TONIGHT AS WELL AS OUR COMMUNITY.

19:35:50 I TRULY BELIEVE THAT THIS TYPE OF TRANSPARENCY IS A GOOD THING FOR LAW 
19:35:53 ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES THROUGHOUT OUR STATE, AND I'LL GET INTO THAT A LITTLE 
19:35:55 BIT MORE IN JUST A BIT.

19:36:05 SO I WANT TO START BY TALKING ABOUT ASSEMBLY BILL AB  481 SIGNED INTO LAW 
19:36:07 ON SEPTEMBER 30TH, 2021.

19:36:13 IT WAS CODIFIED IN GOVERNMENT CODE SECTION 7070 THROUGH 7075, AND IT 
19:36:17 REQUIRES LAW ENFORCEMENT TO OBTAIN APPROVAL TO USE, ACQUIRE OR FUND 
19:36:20 EQUIPMENT  DEFINED AS MILITARY EQUIPMENT.

19:36:27 AND THAT APPROVAL HAS TO BE RECEIVED BY OUR GOVERNING BODY OR CITY COUNCIL.

19:36:33 SO IT ALSO REQUIRES US TO DEVELOP AN ORDINANCE OR POLICY WHICH WE HAVE 
19:36:39 DRAFTED IN RESPONSE TO THIS LAW.

19:36:43 SO AB 481, THE WHY BEHIND IT.

19:36:48 SO THERE IS AN ONGOING DESIRE FROM MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC FOR LAW 
19:36:52 ENFORCEMENT TO BE MORE TRANSPARENT AND BE MORE ACCOUNTABLE WITH THE TYPE OF 
19:36:56 EQUIPMENT THAT'S UTILIZED TO SERVE OUR COMMUNITY.

19:37:01 IT'S ALSO CONFIRMATION OF POLICE LEGITIMACY, SO THE MORE TRANSPARENT 
19:37:05 AND ACCOUNTABLE POLICE AGENCIES ARE, THE COMMUNITY IS GOING TO VIEW THE 
19:37:10 POLICE DEPARTMENT AS LEGITIMATE AND HAVING LEGITIMATE PURPOSE OF UTILIZING 
19:37:15 THE EQUIPMENT THAT I'M GOING TO DESCRIBE A LITTLE BIT LATER.

19:37:18 SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT EACH JURISDICTION AND COMMUNITY HAVE 
19:37:22 UNIQUE PUBLIC SAFETY NEEDS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT EXPECTATIONS.

19:37:28 SPECIALIZED EQUIPMENT IS  ACQUIRED AND DEPLOYED BASED ON WHAT IS NEEDED TO 
19:37:29 KEEP OUR COMMUNITY SAFE.

19:37:38 FREMONT PD DOES NOT PARTICIPATE IN THE GOVERNMENT 10-33 PROGRAM, WHICH IS 
19:37:40 SURPLUS MILITARY EQUIPMENT.

19:37:47 SO ALTHOUGH THE LAW DEFINES SOME OF THE EQUIPMENT THAT I'M GOING TO EXPLAIN AS 
19:37:51 MILITARY  EQUIPMENT, WE DON'T PARTICIPATE IN GETTING EXCESS OR 
19:37:57 SURPLUS MILITARY EQUIPMENT FROM OUR  ARMED SERVICES.

19:38:01 SO I'LL EXPLAIN HOW THAT PLAY NOOSE THIS PRESENTATION A LITTLE BIT LATER, 
19:38:09 BUT IT'S IMPORTANT THAT I DIFFERENTIATE WHAT WE HAVE AND SPECIALIZED EQUIPMENT 
19:38:14 VERSUS SURPLUS EQUIPMENT LIKE M RACKS AND OTHER UNUSED MILITARY EQUIPMENT 
19:38:18 THAT SOME LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES OBTAIN FOR POLICE SERVICES.

19:38:24 WE DO HAVE SPECIALIZED EQUIPMENT AND IT'S BUILT SPECIFICALLY FOW LAW 
19:38:25 ENFORCEMENT USE.

19:38:29 VEHICLES, DEVICES, WEAPONS OR TECHNOLOGY, AGAIN, THAT HAVE A 
19:38:32 LEGITIMATE PURPOSE FOR PUBLIC SAFETY.

19:38:39 THE OBJECTIVE THERE IS TO ENHANCE OUR ABILITY TO ACHIEVE OPERATIONAL GOALS 
19:38:42 DESIGNED TO PROTECT OUR COMMUNITY FROM HARM.

19:38:45 EVERY PIECE OF EQUIPMENT IS DESIGNED TO SUPPORT THAT.

19:38:51 SO HERE IS THE LIST OF THE ITEMS THAT WE DO HAVE AND WE DO  DEPLOY.

19:38:53 PUBLIC SAFETY EQUIPMENT.

19:39:02 AERIAL VEHICLES, THOSE ARE UAV OR A COMMON NAME IS ROAN, SO THIS IS LISTED 
19:39:06 AS MILITARY TYPE EQUIPMENT ALTHOUGH THE TYPE OF DRONES THAT WE FLY, YOU CAN GO 
19:39:11 DOWN TO THE LOCAL DEPARTMENT STORE AND BUY THE EXACT SAME PIECE OF EQUIPMENT.

19:39:17 THE DIFFERENCE IS, BECAUSE WE'RE UTILIZING IT AS A LAW ENFORCEMENT 
19:39:20 AGENCY, IT IS INCLUDED IN THE LAW AS MILITARY EQUIPMENT.

19:39:25 THE SAME THING WITH GROUND VEHICLES, REMOTELY CONTROLLED GROUND VEHICLES 
19:39:25 OROBOTS.

19:39:30 THEY'RE NOT WEAPONIZED, ALL THEY ARE CAMERAS ON WHEELS, AND THEY ALLOW US 
19:39:36 TO GO INTO SITUATIONS THAT ARE UNSTABLE OR UNSAFE AND GET A VISUAL OF WHAT 
19:39:39 WE'RE DEALING WITH, WHETHER IT'S A SUSPECT, A SUSPICIOUS DEVICE ORTHOS 
19:39:41 TYPE OF THINGS.

19:39:47 WE ALSO HAVE TWO ARMORED  VEHICLE, WE HAVE A BEARCAT  ARMORED VEHICLE AS 
19:39:52 WELL AS A  MEDCAT RESCUE VEHICLE WHICH ARE ESSENTIALLY THE SAME BUT THE  
19:39:55 MEDCAT HAS LIFE SAVING EQUIPMENT EMBEDDED INSIDE SO IF THERE'S AN 
19:39:59 UNSTABLE OR DANGEROUS SITUATION IN WHICH WE NEED TO GO IN AND PROVIDE 
19:40:01 MEDICAL ASSISTANCE, WE CAN DO THAT SAFELY.

19:40:05 OUR MOBILE COMMAND VEHICLE THAT WE SHARE WITH OUR FIRE DEPARTMENT IS ALSO 
19:40:09 ON THE LIST OF ITEMS THAT WE NEED TO DECLARE.

19:40:14 THAT IS A SHARED VEHICLE AND IT HAS COMMUNICATIONS CAPABILITIES AND ALSO 
19:40:16 OPERATES AS A COMMAND POST.

19:40:22 OUR HOSTAGE NEGOTIATIONS TEAM VAN, SIMILAR, THAT VAN IS  OUTFITTED WITH 
19:40:27 SPECIAL EQUIPMENT TO COMMUNICATE WITH BARRICADED SUBJECTS AND THE INTENT 
19:40:34 THERE IS TO ACHIEVE A PEACEFUL SURRENDER TO OUR AUTHORITY.

19:40:42 WE DO HAVE BREACHING SHOTGUNS DESIGNED TO DEFEAT BARRICADES OR LOCKING 
19:40:46 MECHANISMS IN AN EMERGENCY SITUATION IN WHICH WE NEED TO GET INTO A LOCATION 
19:40:48 IN ORDER TO SAVE LIVES.

19:40:53 WE HAVE SPECIALIZED FIREARMS AS WELL FOR SOME OF OUR SPECIALTY UNITS LIKE 
19:40:57 OUR SPECIAL WEAPONS AND TACTICS TEAM, AS WELL AS SOME OF OUR TASK FORCE, WE 
19:41:02 DO HAVE SPECIALTY FIREARMS DESIGNED FOR THOSE GROUPS.

19:41:10 DIVERSIONARY DEVICES COMMONLY KNOWN AS FLASH-BANGS, WE DO DEPLOY THOSE VERY 
19:41:14 RARELY BUT WE DO HAVE THOSE IN OUR INVENTORY OF EQUIPMENT, AND THOSE ARE 
19:41:20 DESIGNED TO, AGAIN, ENSURE THAT WE ARE ABLE TO ENTER FACILITIES THAT ARE 
19:41:25 DANGEROUS BY USING DISTRACTIONS AND THOSE TYPE OF THINGS.

19:41:27 WE DO DEPLOY GAS AND SMOKE.

19:41:33 AGAIN, VERY RARELY DO WE DO THAT BUT WE HAVE THAT AND ON OCCASION WE DEPLOY 
19:41:35 THOSE DEVICES AS WELL.

19:41:42 WE HAVE PEPPER-BALL PIECES OF EQUIPMENT WHICH ARE ALTERNATIVE FORCE OPTIONS.

19:41:46 THESE DEVICES ARE DESIGNED TO MAKE IT UNCOMFORTABLE FOR FOLKS WHO ARE 
19:41:49 RESISTING ARREST OR POSE A DANGER TO THE COMMUNITY OR THEMSELVES.

19:41:55 AND LASTLY, WE HAVE 40-MILLIMETER PROJECTILE  LAUNCHER, WHICH ARE 
19:42:04 ANOTHER ALTERNATIVE FORCE OPTION,  DESIGNED TO BE AN OPTION OTHER THAN 
19:42:05 LETHAL FORCE.

19:42:11 SO OUR POLICY MUST INCLUDE EQUIPMENT DESCRIPTION, QUANTITY, CAPABILITIES 
19:42:16 AND EXPECTED LIFESPAN OF EACH PIECE OF EQUIPMENT THAT WE UTILIZE.

19:42:21 THE PROPOSED USE, THE FISCAL IMPACT, INITIAL COST AND ESTIMATED ANNUAL COST 
19:42:23 HAS TO BE EMBEDDED IN OUR POLICIES AS  WELL.

19:42:28 THE LEGAL OR PROCEDURAL RULES THAT GOVERN EACH AUTHORIZED USE.

19:42:33 TRAINING STANDARDS AND REQUIREMENTS, DESIGNATED ENTITY TASKED TO REVIEW THE 
19:42:37 POLICY, AND FOR ME, I THINK THAT'S A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR MY COMMUNITY 
19:42:42 ADVISORY GROUP ON AN ANNUAL BASIS TO REVIEW OUR DEPLOYMENTS AND HOW WE 
19:42:46 DEPLOY AND THEY GIVE ME FEEDBACK ON THAT, AS WELL AS THE COMMUNITY AS A 
19:42:46 WHOLE.

19:42:50 AND THEN WE HAVE TO HAVE HOW TO REGISTER COMPLAINTS FROM OUR COMMUNITY 
19:42:53 EMBEDDED IN OUR  POLICY.

19:42:58 ACCOUNTABILITY, TRANSPARENCY AND THE LAW, AND HOW THIS IS ALL RELATED.

19:43:03 SO AGAIN, I'M HAPPY TO PRESENT THIS INFORMATION TO THE COMMUNITY, TO ALL 
19:43:10 OF YOU BECAUSE FREMONT FOR A LONG TIME HAVE DONE A LOT OF WHAT THE LAW 
19:43:15 REQUIRES AS FAR AS SHOWING THIS EQUIPMENT TO OUR COMMUNITY, BEING VERY 
19:43:19 TRANSPARENT ON HOW WE UTILIZE IT, AND TRACKING WHEN WE DEPLOY THESE 
19:43:21 PARTICULAR PIECES OF EQUIPMENT.

19:43:30 SO ACCOUNTABILITY, THE ANNUAL INTERNAL REVIEW OF FPD EQUIPMENT LIST, SO THAT 
19:43:34 WILL BE FROM ME AND MY STAFF TO REVIEWER OUR EQUIPMENT LIST ON AN 
19:43:37 ANNUAL BASIS TO ENSURE WE HAVE EVERYTHING.

19:43:40 IF WE'RE TRYING TO OBTAIN NEW EQUIPMENT, OBVIOUSLY THAT WOULD HAVE 
19:43:42 TO GO BEFORE THE COUNCIL TO GET APPROVAL.

19:43:47 THE ANNUAL REVIEW OF THE DOCK SEUMENTS BY OUR CITY COUNCIL, I THINK IS A GOOD 
19:43:47 THING.

19:43:52 AGAIN, REPRESENTING THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE IS IMPORTANT THAT THE COUNCIL 
19:43:56 UNDERSTANDS HOW, WHY, AND THE TYPE OF EQUIPMENT THAT WE'RE DEPLOYING.

19:44:02 THE INFORMATION BEING AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC, THERE IS A REQUIREMENT IN THE 
19:44:09 LAW THAT AFTER THE ANNUAL REPORT IS PRODUCED, WE HAVE TO PROVIDE A 
19:44:14 COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT SESSION 30 DAYS AFTER SUBMITTING THAT ANNUAL REPORT.

19:44:16 AGAIN, I WELCOME THAT TYPE OF ENGAGEMENT.

19:44:22 THE COMMUNITY ADVISORY GROUP, ONCE AGAIN, LIKE I TALKED ABOUT, IS GOING 
19:44:27 TO BE A KEY COMPONENT TO ENSURING ANOTHER LEVEL OF ACCOUNTABILITY, 
19:44:30 TRANSPARENCY, AND OPENNESS TO HOW WE DEPLOY THIS EQUIPMENT.

19:44:37 AND THEN TRANSPARENCY ITSELF, THE MILITARY EQUIPMENT POLICY WHICH WILL 
19:44:42 BE AVAILABLE ON OUR WEBSITE, THE DRAFT VERSION IS AVAILABLE ON OUR WEBSITE 
19:44:42 RIGHT NOW.

19:44:45 THAT WAS A REQUIREMENT 30 DAYS PRIOR TO THIS CITY COUNCIL MEETING.

19:44:49 THE ANNUAL REPORT WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR THE COMMUNITY TO REVIEW AS WELL.

19:44:56 IT WILL SHOW HOW -- HAVE A SUMMARY OF HOW EQUIPMENT WAS  USED, ANY AUDITS OR 
19:45:00 COMPLAINTS WILL BE EMBEDDED IN THERE AND OTHER ACCOUNTING REQUIREMENTS AS 
19:45:01 OUTLINED IN THE GOVERNMENT CODE.

19:45:06 SO POLICE LEGITIMACY, THAT'S HOW IT ALL TIES IN.

19:45:14 AB 481, THE IMPACT TO FREMONT PD, LIKE I SAID, WE HAVE BEEN VERY OPEN AND 
19:45:18 TRANSPARENT AND THIS WILL FORMALIZE THAT PROCESS IN A LOT OF WAY, SO HE 
19:45:25 ALTHOUGH WE DIDN'T DOCUMENT ALL OF THE DEPLOYMENTS AND THOSE THINGS IN THE 
19:45:29 PAST, WE HAVE HAD INTERNAL LOGS TO KEEP TRACK OF SOME OF THAT EQUIPMENT.

19:45:34 SO THIS WILL FORMALIZE IT A LITTLE BIT MORE FOR US BUT THERE'S NOT A BIG LEAP 
19:45:35 FOR US TO ADJUST TO THIS LAW.

19:45:39 WE'VE HAD A LONG HISTORY OF COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT, TRANSPARENCY AND 
19:45:41 ACCOUNTABILITY, AND WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE  THAT.

19:45:47 THE EQUIPMENT IS DEPLOYED ONLY IF THERE IS A TRUE BELIEF THE USE WILL ASSIST 
19:45:48 OR ENHANCE PUBLIC SAFETY.

19:45:53 I BELIEVE IN THE USE OF THIS EQUIPMENT, I THINK IT DOES SUPPORT AND ENHANCE 
19:45:59 PUBLIC SAFETY, ESPECIALLY IN THOSE HIGH LEVEL DANGEROUS SITUATIONS.

19:46:10 WE DO NOT DEPLOY OR USE ALL THE EQUIPMENT LISTED BECAUSE WE'VE MADE 
19:46:15 THE ASSESSMENT BECAUSE IT'S EITHER INAPPROPRIATE OR UNNECESSARY FOR OUR 
19:46:15 COMMUNITY.

19:46:20 SO THERE'S EQUIPMENT THAT -- M WRAP VEHICLES THAT ARE MINE RESISTANT THAT 
19:46:24 SOME AGENCIES UTILIZE AND IT WORKS FOR THEIR PARTICULAR JURISDICTION, BUT FOR 
19:46:27 US, WE'VE MADE THE ASSESSMENT THAT WE REALLY DON'T NEED THAT TYPE OF 
19:46:30 EQUIPMENT HERE TO SERVE OUR COMMUNITY EFFECTIVELY.

19:46:38 AND THEN WE CONDUCT THE NEEDS ASSESSMENT ON AN ONGOING BASIS AND WE 
19:46:40 EVALUATE THE EQUIPMENT AS WE GO.

19:46:45 SO IF THERE'S EVER A NEED OR COMMUNITY EXPECTATIONS EVOLVE OR WE FEEL LIKE WE 
19:46:49 DON'T NEED A PIECE OF EQUIPMENT OR IF WE FEEL LIKE WE NEED TO TRY TO ACQUIRE 
19:46:55 ANOTHER PIECE OF EQUIPMENT, WE'LL DO THAT AND THEN COME BEFORE OUR COUNCIL 
19:46:59 TO EXPLAIN WHY WE BELIEVE THAT IT'S IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE COMMUNITY FOR 
19:47:00 US TO HAVE IT.

19:47:07 SO PREPARING FOR THE LAW, WE CREATED THE POLICY AND A  DETAILED EQUIPMENT 
19:47:07 LIST.

19:47:11 WE RESEARCHED BEST PRACTICES, SO I REACHED OUT TO OTHER AGENCIES 
19:47:14 THROUGHOUT THE REGION AND THROUGHOUT THE STATE TO GET A BETTER 
19:47:18 UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THEY ARE GOING ABOUT MAKING THESE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE 
19:47:18 LAW.

19:47:24 WE DEVELOPED AN ORDINANCE WORKING WITH THE CITY ATTORNEY'S OFFICE WHICH WE 
19:47:25 VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE ASSISTANCE THERE.

19:47:31 WE INFORMED OUR CITY LEADERS, WE REVIEWED THE LAW AND CONDUCTED AN 
19:47:38 EQUIPMENT FAMILIARIZATION SESSION IF THEY WANTED TO TAKE PART IN THAT, AND 
19:47:42 THEN WE HAD ONGOING DISCUSSIONS WITH COMMUNITY REPRESENTATIVES.

19:47:46 I KNOW I HAVE DISCUSSED THIS TOPIC WITH VARIOUS COMMUNITY GROUPS OVER THE PAST 
19:47:51 COUPLE OF MONTHS TO GET FEEDBACK AND PERSPECTIVE, AND ALSO AT MY MONTHLY 
19:47:56 COMMUNITY ADVISORY GROUP MEETINGS, I ALSO REVIEWED THIS WITH THEM AS WELL.

19:48:02 SO WITH THAT, I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT WHY I THINK 
19:48:07 THIS EQUIPMENT SHOULD CONTINUE TO BE USED IN THIS COMMUNITY.

19:48:12 I FEEL LIKE OUR DEPARTMENT HAS HAD A TRACK RECORD OF UTILIZING THIS 
19:48:18 EQUIPMENT ONLY WHEN NECESSARY, AND ONLY TO SUPPORT AND SERVE OUR COMMUNITY TO 
19:48:21 ENSURE WE CAN DO ALL WE CAN TO KEEP THE COMMUNITY SAFE.

19:48:27 AND WITH THAT, I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE.

19:48:32 >> Mayor Mei: WONDERFUL.

19:48:37 WE'LL FIRST TURN TO THE COUNCILMEMBERS FOR ANY  CLARIFYING QUESTIONS.

19:48:41 COUNCILMEMBER -- OR VICE MAYOR SALWAN.

19:48:46 SAL THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR.

19:48:52 THANK YOU, CHIEF, FOR YOUR EFFORTS TO IMPROVE AND ENHANCE TRANSPARENCY.

19:48:56 JUST FOR THE PUBLIC THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE AWARE, WE ARE NOT ADDING ANY NEW 
19:48:56 EQUIPMENT TODAY.

19:49:03 WE ARE JUST TRYING TO COMPLY WITH THIS NEW AB -- WHATEVER LAW IT WAS, IS THAT 
19:49:03 CORRECT?

19:49:04 >> THAT IS CORRECT.

19:49:09 WE ARE NOT REQUESTING ADDING ANY EQUIPMENT.

19:49:11 WE'RE JUST REQUESTING APPROVAL TO CONTINUE TO USE THE EQUIPMENT THAT 
19:49:14 WE'VE USED FOR SEVERAL YEARS AND DECADES.

19:49:19 >> Vice Mayor Salwan: AND IF ANY NEW EQUIPMENT THAT IS IN THIS CATEGORY 
19:49:23 THAT WE ADD, YOU WILL COME BACK AND PRESENT IT AND WE'LL HAVE A DISCUSSION 
19:49:25 ON IT, IS THAT CORRECT?

19:49:28 >> THAT IS CORRECT, YES.

19:49:29 >> Vice Mayor Salwan: OKAY.

19:49:29 THANK YOU, CHIEF.

19:49:32 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:49:34 COUNCILMEMBER COX, CLARIFYING QUESTION?

19:49:37 >> Councilmember Cox: THANK YOU.

19:49:44 THANK YOU SO MUCH TO OUR FREMONT POLICE CHIEF SEAN WASHINGTON AND HIS STAFF 
19:49:49 FOR PUTTING THIS PRESENTATION AND WORK AND ALL OF THOSE INVOLVED.

19:49:54 THE PUBLIC MAY NOT KNOW THIS, BUT WE -- AT LEAST I CAN SPEAK FOR MYSELF THAT I 
19:50:01 DID TAKE A TOUR AND LOOK AT THE ACTUAL EQUIPMENT THAT IS GOING ON THE 
19:50:07 INVENTORY LIST, AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THE PUBLIC KNOWS THAT IT'S 
19:50:08 SOMETHING THAT WE LOOKED  AT.

19:50:17 I REALLY DID A LOT OF  QUESTIONING WITH THE FELLOW FREMONT POLICE OFFICERS, 
19:50:23 MAKING SURE THAT I UNDERSTOOD WHAT EACH ONE OF THESE ITEMS MEANS AND KEEPING 
19:50:31 THE EQUIPMENT, SO THIS WAS AN INVENTORY OF THE CURRENT LIST OF EQUIPMENT.

19:50:38 AND THEY'RE NOT DESIGNED FOR MILITARY USE, CORRECT, AND NOR DO WE BUY AT ALL 
19:50:40 FROM ANY OF THE SURPLUS.

19:50:46 ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I THINK WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO CLARIFY IS THAT WITH THE 
19:50:52 LIST OF EQUIPMENT, ARE THERE OTHER AGENCIES THAT WOULD SHARE IN USING 
19:50:59 THIS EQUIPMENT, AND I KNOW THAT YOU DID HAVE YOUR PUBLIC SAFETY EQUIPMENT LIST 
19:51:03 AS PART OF YOUR PRESENTATION, WHICH I APPRECIATE TO KIND OF GIVE US A HIGH 
19:51:08 LEVEL, BUT IS THERE SOME IDENTIFIED -- I THINK YOU SAID ONE WAS THE MOBILE 
19:51:13 COMMAND VEHICLE THAT'S SHARED WITH THE FIRE, BUT IS THERE ANY OTHER AGENCIES 
19:51:20 OUTSIDE OF FREMONT THAT WOULD BE USING THIS EQUIPMENT AND JUST TO MAKE SURE I 
19:51:23 UNDERSTAND THAT PART AND MAYBE OTHERS THAT MAY NOT BE CLEAR?

19:51:30 >> YES, AND THANK YOU, COUNCILMEMBER, FOR THAT  QUESTION.

19:51:31 THERE'S TWO THINGS HERE.

19:51:36 ONE IS, THE MEDCAT THAT I TALKED ABOUT, THAT'S THE ARMORED VEHICLE THAT HAS 
19:51:44 MEDICAL EQUIPMENT INSIDE, YEARS AGO, WE HAD A JOINT GRANT WITH SAN LEANDRO PD 
19:51:46 THAT WE SHARE OR  CO-OWN THAT VEHICLE.

19:51:52 SO SAN LEANDRO, IT'S STAGED UP IN SAN LEANDRO, AND WHENEVER WE HAVE A 
19:51:55 CRITICAL INCIDENT, WE REQUEST THAT VEHICLE COME DOWN TO FREMONT AND THEY 
19:51:57 PROVIDE A DRIVER AND THEY BRING IT DOWN.

19:52:05 SO WE DO CO-OWN THAT VEHICLE WITH SAN LEANDRO PD, OR THE CITY OF SAN 
19:52:09 LEANDRO, AND SO THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE TO GO BEFORE THEIR COUNCIL LIKE I AM 
19:52:12 TO SEEK APPROVAL TO CONTINUE TO USE THAT EQUIPMENT AS WELL.

19:52:16 SO WE DO CO-OWN THAT MEDCAT.

19:52:21 AND THEN IF THERE'S A CALL FOR LIKE MUTUAL AID OR GOING TO ANOTHER 
19:52:26 JURISDICTION TO UTILIZE THIS EQUIPMENT, AGAIN, ALL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES 
19:52:32 ARE GOING BEFORE THEIR COUNCIL TO GET APPROVAL TO HAVE MUTUAL AID COME IN 
19:52:35 AND PROVIDE ACCESS TO THIS EQUIPMENT.

19:52:39 SO THERE IS A POSSIBILITY THAT IF WE ARE SUMMONED DOWN TO IF THERE'S A 
19:52:43 SHOOTING OR A MASS SHOOTING OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND MUTUAL AID IS 
19:52:47 REQUESTED, WE COULD THEN TAKE OUR EQUIPMENT UP TO ANOTHER JURISDICTION, 
19:52:54 , AS LONG AS IT'S APPROVED BY THEIR GOVERNING BODY AND ASSIST THOSE 
19:52:54 JURISDICTIONS AS WELL.

19:53:00 >> Councilmember Cox: OKAY, AND THAT'S JUST REALLY FOR THE MEDCAT, THAT'S THE 
19:53:02 ONLY ONE OR WHICH OTHER ONES ON THE LIST?

19:53:06 >> SO THE MEDCAT IS THE ONLY PIECE OF EQUIPMENT THAT WE  CO-OWN WITH ANY 
19:53:07 OTHER OUTSIDE JURISDICTION.

19:53:12 THE MOBILE COMMAND VEHICLE IS CITY OWNED BUT WE JUST SHARE IT WITH OUR 
19:53:13 WONDERFUL PARTNERS OVER THERE AT THE FIRE DEPARTMENT.

19:53:16 >> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.

19:53:17 FANTASTIC.

19:53:24 AND HAS THERE BEEN ANY -- LET ME ASK THIS.

19:53:30 AS YOU LOOK AT NEW EQUIPMENT, THEN HOW ARE YOU TYING THAT WITH THE 
19:53:35 PROCUREMENT DEPARTMENT IN TERMS OF THE IDENTIFYING NEW EQUIPMENT SO THAT IT 
19:53:40 GETS  TRACKED AND I GUESS REGISTERED AND PUT ON TO THE POLICY LIST, IF YOU 
19:53:42 COULD SHARE A LITTLE BIT OF INFORMATION ABOUT THAT, THAT WOULD BE GREAT.

19:53:48 >> SO IF WE IDENTIFIED A PIECE OF EQUIPMENT THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO 
19:53:54 PURCHASE AND WE FEEL IT'S SUPPORTIVE OF PUBLIC SAFETY OBJECTIVES, WE WOULD 
19:54:00 FIRST HAVE A CONVERSATION, AGAIN, WITH THE GOVERNING BODY, THE COUNCIL, TO 
19:54:07 EXPLAIN THE WHY FIRST, BEFORE WE WOULD GO OUT AND START ACTIVELY MAKING -- 
19:54:10 REQUEST A PURCHASE AND SECURING FUNDING AND ALL THOSE OTHER SORTS OF THINGS.

19:54:15 WE WOULD FIRST COME TO CITY COUNCIL TO SEEK APPROVAL BEFORE MOVING FORWARD.

19:54:21 SO WE WOULD HAVE TO TAKE THAT STEP FIRST PER THE LAW BEFORE WE WOULD ADD 
19:54:27 ANY EQUIPMENT TO OUR CURRENT INVENTORY OF WHAT IS CONSIDERED MILITARY 
19:54:28 EQUIPMENT.

19:54:31 >> Councilmember Cox: THANK YOU.

19:54:33 THANK YOU FOR CLARIFYING THOSE QUESTIONS.

19:54:33 >> NO PROBLEM.

19:54:35 THANK YOU.

19:54:40 >> Mayor Mei: CLARIFYING QUESTIONS, COUNCILMEMBER SHAO.

19:54:46 >> Councilmember Shao: THANK  YOU VERY MUCH, MADAME MAYOR, AND THANK YOU, 
19:54:51 CHIEF WASHINGTON, FOR LETTING US TO REVIEW THE EQUIPMENT AS WELL AS GOING 
19:54:52 THROUGH THE DOCUMENT.

19:54:59 THAT WAS A VERY PLEASANT EXPERIENCE, A WONDERFUL SATURDAY MORNING, AND I 
19:55:02 NOTICED AT THE TIME YOU WERE ACTUALLY OFF DUTY AND YOU WERE STILL THERE.

19:55:03 THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

19:55:07 MY QUESTION ACTUALLY IS FROM A COMMUNITY MEMBER.

19:55:21 HE REMEMBERED THAT WE USED  SNAPPING RIFLES FOR THE AUGUST ART FESTIVAL 
19:55:30 EVENT IN THE TOWER, AND IN YOUR PRESENTATION,  SNAPPING RIFLE IS NOT 
19:55:31 LISTED THERE.

19:55:36 THE QUESTION IS, IS THAT BECAUSE IT'S A STANDARD ISSUE POLICE WEAPON, 
19:55:44 THEREFORE, IT'S NOT COUNTED AS A MILITARY EQUIPMENT EVEN THOUGH WE SEE 
19:55:50 SNAPPING  RIFLE USED A LOT IN WARS, YOU KNOW, USED BY THE MILITARY?

19:55:58 >> SO TO ME, IT FALLS UNDER THE GENERAL CATEGORY OF SPECIALIZED FIREARMS FOR A 
19:56:04 LOT OF THIS, AND IT IS A STANDARD EQUIPMENT MEANING THERE'S NOT ANY 
19:56:05 MODIFICATIONS OR ANYTHING.

19:56:10 IT'S A SNIPER RIFLE FOR SPECIFIC USE.

19:56:16 HOWEVER, IT'S NOT A WEAPON THAT IS DEPLOYED IN PATROL.

19:56:22 SO IT'S GOING TO FALL UNDER THE GENERAL CATEGORY OF SPECIALIZED FIREARMS, I 
19:56:26 THINK THAT'S HOW I -- HOW IT'S CATEGORIZED IN THE REPORT.

19:56:31 >> Councilmember Shao: THANK  YOU.

19:56:32 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:56:37 THAT'S FOR CLARIFYING QUESTIONS RIGHT NOW, I'LL TURN TO THE -- AT THIS TIME 
19:56:40 I'LL OPEN UP FOR PUBLIC HEARING.

19:56:44 AND I SEE THERE ARE TWO SPEAKERS AT LEAST RIGHT NOW.

19:56:45 THE FIRST SPEAKER IS CHRIS.

19:56:47 WELCOME, CHRIS.

19:57:00 >> SO I'D LIKE TO URGE THE CITY COUNCIL TO APPROVE THE MAYOR BUT I'D ALSO LIKE 
19:57:04 THE CITY COUNCIL TO MAKE AN AMENDMENT WHERE THEY ARE ACTUALLY MAKING THE 
19:57:10 POLICE DEPARTMENT COME FORWARD AND PRESENT TO THE PUBLIC IN CITY COUNCIL 
19:57:15 MEETINGS WITHIN ONE MONTH OF WHEN THIS EQUIPMENT IS USED, SO THE PUBLIC CAN 
19:57:19 UNDERSTAND WHETHER THIS EQUIPMENT IS NEEDED OR NOT, AND HOW OFTEN IT'S 
19:57:33 USED, AND, THEREFORE, AS US, THE PEOPLE THAT DRIVE THE GOVERNMENT IN FREMONT, 
19:57:35 WE CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT THE USE IS.

19:57:38 CURRENTLY AS EVERYONE IS DOING IT, THEY'RE SAYING, OH, WE'VE DONE IT 
19:57:47 BEFORE, WE HAVE IT,  AND -- BUT I DON'T HEAR THAT WE'VE TRACKED IT, I DON'T 
19:57:52 HEAR THAT WE'VE DISCLOSED TO THE PUBLIC, AND SO I'D LIKE THE CITY 
19:58:02 COUNCIL TO TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT AND CONSIDER, AS THEY APPROVE THIS, THAT 
19:58:05 THEY WILL ACTUALLY REPORT TO THE PUBLIC WHEN IT'S USED AND ASK THE POLICE 
19:58:11 DEPARTMENT TO COME FORWARD AND GIVE THAT INFORMATION TO CITY COUNCIL 
19:58:13 MEETINGS WITHIN A MONTH OF THE ACTUAL USE.

19:58:18 I'LL RESERVE MY TIME IF SOMEONE WANTS TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS.

19:58:30 >> NEXT SPEAKER IS BLAIR  BEEKMAN.

19:58:30 >> HI.

19:58:32 BLAIR BEEKMAN.

19:58:33 GOING SECOND.

19:58:33 THANK YOU.

19:58:41 FOR THIS ITEM, I GUESS, YOU  KNOW, I WONDER IF WE ARE IN A DIFFERENT SPACE 
19:58:42 COMPARED TO A FEW YEARS AGO.

19:58:46 I MEAN, PEOPLE WOULD BE TEARING DOWN THE WALLS RIGHT NOW AFTER THE GEORGE 
19:58:49 FLOYD THING, BUT WE MAY BE AT A DIFFERENT PLACE RIGHT NOW.

19:58:51 AND WE'RE FINDING OUR BALANCE.

19:58:54 GOOD LUCK HOW WE CAN DO THAT.

19:59:01 I STILL THINK WE HAVE TO BE REALLY FOCUSING ON HOW WE DEMILITARIZE OUR 
19:59:06 FUTURE, AND THAT WE HAVE GUIDELINES AND PROCEDURES AND PRACTICES THAT CAN 
19:59:11 REALLY DO THAT, AND IT'S CONVERSATION, IT'S THE PUBLIC MEETING PROCESS.

19:59:13 IT'S NOT INVITING MORE SROs TO THE PROCESS.

19:59:19 IT'S THE COMMUNITY TALKING AMONGST THEMSELVES AND LEARNING HOW TO MAKE 
19:59:22 DEMANDS OF EACH OTHER, AND IT'S NOT THROUGH MORE ARMED CONFLICT.

19:59:23 THAT'S MY FEELING.

19:59:25 AND I THINK WE CAN DO IT.

19:59:27 I REALLY THINK WE CAN DO IT.

19:59:32 I THINK EVERYONE CAN LEARN LESSONS HOW THERE CAN BE LESS GUN USE, HOW WE CAN 
19:59:35 USELESS VIOLENCE SIMPLY THROUGH CONVERSATION AND DIALOGUE.

19:59:40 AND OFFERING IDEAS LIKE WHAT WE DO WITH THE SURVEILLANCE AND TECHNOLOGY STUFF 
19:59:44 THAT CREATES A WAY THAT THE COMMUNITY ITSELF CAN HAVE A MUCH MORE IMPORTANT 
19:59:47 ROLE IN THE FUTURE OF HOW WE PRACTICE AS A COMMUNITY.

19:59:50 IT REALLY INTERESTING WORK.

19:59:55 THERE IS A DEDICATION THAT WE ARE WORKING TOWARDS PEACE AT THIS TIME.

19:59:56 RUSSIA DIDN'T GET THAT.

20:00:02 THE U.S. REALLY CAN BE BUILDING A REALLY IMPORTANT SUSTAINABLE FUTURE 
20:00:06 IDEAS RIGHT NOW THROUGH REIMAGINE, THROUGH EQUITY, AND WE HAVE TO REALLY 
20:00:10 APPLY THOSE THINGS AND WHEN WE DO, WE MOVE TOWARDS A MORE PEACEFUL FUTURE.

20:00:18 THERE IS, YOU KNOW, ARMED ASSAULT RIFLES ON THE BACK OF FREMONT MOTOR 
20:00:23  MOTORCYCLES THAT HAVE BEEN THERE SINCE 9/11.

20:00:25 HOW DO WE END THAT, HOW DO WE ASK ABOUT THAT?

20:00:28 THOSE ARE THE SORT OF THINGS WE NEED TO GROW UP ABOUT.

20:00:31 GOOD LUCK HOW WE CAN ALL MAKE THOSE STEPS.

20:00:32 THANK YOU.

20:00:34 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

20:00:36 THE NEXT SPEAKER IS KELLY ABREU.

20:00:38 WELCOME, KELLY.

20:00:39 >> GOOD EVENING.

20:00:45 THERE IS A HIDDEN COST TO ACQUIRING AND USING THIS EQUIPMENT THAT PEOPLE KIND 
20:00:46 OF FORGET ABOUT.

20:00:51 BECAUSE IT TAKES TRAINING TO DRIVE A CAR OR TO DRIVE A TANK, OR TO SHOOT A 
20:00:56 PROJECTILE WEAPON OR TO FLY A DRONE, AND TRAINING COSTS MONEY, AND MORE 
20:00:58 EQUIPMENT COSTS MONEY.

20:01:05 SO YOU KNOW, WE CAN'T JUST ACQUIRE ALL MOUNTAINS OF EQUIPMENT AND THINK THAT, 
20:01:07 YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST EQUIPMENT.

20:01:08 IT COSTS MORE THAN EQUIPMENT.

20:01:13 AND OF COURSE THE USE OF THE EQUIPMENT IS NOT JUST OUR POLICY AND WHAT THE 
20:01:13 CITY DOES IN THE FUTURE.

20:01:16 IT WOULD BE NICE TO KNOW WHAT THE CITY HAS BEEN DOING WITH ALL THIS EQUIPMENT 
20:01:20 IN THE PAST, AND WE ALL KNOW THAT IT BEEN USED IN THE PAST.

20:01:26 NOW, WHEN IT COMES TO THE POLITICS OF THIS ITEM OR HOW THIS ITEM IS BEING 
20:01:32 TREATED, THERE'S A MASSIVE GAP, A HUGE CHASM BETWEEN HOW THE BOARD OF 
20:01:38 SUPERVISORS OF ALAMEDA COUNTY TREATS THIS POLICY DISCUSSION AND HOW THIS 
20:01:41 CITY COUNCIL IS TREATING THE DISCUSSION.

20:01:43 THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS MET THIS AFTERNOON.

20:01:45 THEY HAD THIS ITEM ON THEIR AGENDA.

20:01:49 THEY HAD SEVERAL PEOPLE LINED UP TO COMMENT ON THE PROPOSED POLICY, BUT 
20:01:52 THEIR BOARD TOOK IT OFF THE AGENDA.

20:01:58 THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS IS LOOKING MORE AND MORE LIKE A PROGRESSIVE 
20:02:04 LIBERAL LEFT WING PACIFIST, YOU KNOW, YELLOW BELLIED ORGANIZATION COMPARED 
20:02:08 TO THE CITY OF FREMONT, BECAUSE THEY TOOK IT OFF THEIR AGENDA, SEEMS LIKE 
20:02:11 THEY WANT TO DISCUSS IT MORE OR SOMETHING.

20:02:14 AND IT'S THE SHERIFF.

20:02:19 THE SHERIFF DOES A LOT OF THE JAILS, THEY DO A LOT OF THE RECRUIT TRAINING 
20:02:19 ACADEMY  CLASSES.

20:02:24 SO THIS CITY MAYBE SHOULD THINK ABOUT LOOKING AT THE COUNTY POLICY WHENEVER 
20:02:28 THEY DO COME UP WITH IT, MAYBE SHARE OR CO-OWNED SOME OF THESE POLICIES WITH 
20:02:35 OTHER LOCAL AGENCIES, SHARE THE BEST PRACTICES AND POLICIES FOR USING 
20:02:35 MILITARY EQUIPMENT.

20:02:40 WE'RE JUST JUMPING RIGHT IN HERE INTO WATERS WHERE THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS 
20:02:41 FEARS TO TREAD.

20:02:49 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

20:02:51 THE NEXT SPEAKER IS MARIE H.

20:02:53 WELCOME.

20:02:55 >> THIS IS MARIE HUGHES, RESIDENT OF FREMONT.

20:03:01 I AM ALL FOR THE INCREASED TRANSPARENCY AT ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT, BUT I AM 
20:03:08 AGAINST THE MILITARIZATION OF POLICE.

20:03:13 IN PARTICULAR, GIVEN THAT WE KNOW THAT THIS PROGRAM HAS POOR RECORD-KEEPING 
20:03:18 AND SOME POLICE DEPARTMENTS HAVE EVEN LOST TRACK OF SOME OF THIS EQUIPMENT, 
20:03:19 WHICH IS SOMEWHAT HORRIFYING TO THINK ABOUT.

20:03:23 WHY AM I AGAINST THE MILITARIZATION OF THE POLICE?

20:03:28 IT HAS BEEN SHOWN THAT USING MILITARY GRADE EQUIPMENT INCREASES THE 
20:03:32 INTENSITY OF THE VIOLENCE THAT POLICE HAVE AVAILABLE IN PURSUING SUBJECTS.

20:03:39 WE ALREADY HAVE SEEN SOME INSTANCES IN FREMONT WHERE PURSUIT OF SUSPECT HAS 
20:03:41 LED TO SOME REALLY POOR OUTCOMES.

20:03:43 I WOULD NOT LIKE TO INTENSIFY THAT.

20:03:47 AND WE ALL KNOW THAT WHEN YOU HAVE EQUIPMENT, THERE IS A PRESSURE TO USE 
20:03:47 IT.

20:03:55 AS AN EXAMPLE, I PERSONALLY EXPERIENCED BEING AT A PROTEST AND SEEING A SNIPER 
20:03:58 POSTED ON A BUILDING OVERLOOKING OUR EXTREMELY PEACEFUL PROTEST.

20:04:00 THIS DEFINITELY DID NOT MAKE ME FEEL SAFER.

20:04:06 IN ADDITION TO THAT, MILITARIZATION HAS A CULTURE IMPACT.

20:04:10 IT COMMUNICATES THAT SOME MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, ESPECIALLY MINORITIES, 
20:04:14 ARE THREATS TO SOCIETY JUST LIKE MILITARY ENEMIES.

20:04:19 AND IT IMPLIES THE ROLE OF THE POLICE AND THE ROLE OF MILITARY ARE THE SAME, 
20:04:23 WHICH THEY ARE FLOT, AND BLURS THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT 
20:04:25 AND NATIONAL SECURITY OPERATIONS.

20:04:29 FREMONT PD ADVERTISES IN ENGAGING IN COMMUNITY POLICING.

20:04:34 IN MY OPINION, COMMUNITY POLICING IS INCOMPATIBLE WITH MILITARIZATION AND I 
20:04:42 DO APPRECIATE THE FREMONT PD HAS FINISHED -- AND I URGE THEM TO 
20:04:46  -- WHENEVER POSSIBLE.

20:04:47 THANK YOU.

20:04:48 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

20:04:49 NEXT SPEAKER IS JOHN HINDS.

20:04:54 >> HELLO, EVERYONE.

20:04:58 OFFERING A COUNTER POINT TO SOME OF THE OTHER VERY THOUGHTFUL SPEAKERS WE JUST 
20:05:03 HEARD, WE POSSESS THESE ITEMS AND AS KELLY POINTS OUT, WE SPEND MONEY AND 
20:05:09 TIME TO MAINTAIN THEM AND TRAIN WITH THEM, BUT WE FERVENTLY HOPE THAT WE 
20:05:10 WON'T ACTUALLY USE THEM.

20:05:28 AND WHEN WE DO TAKE THEM OUT, IT NEEDS TO BE WITH GREAT  CIRCUMSPECTION AS 
20:05:29 MARIE WAS GETTING TO.

20:05:33 IT'S A GOOD THING WE HAVE THIS LIST AND THIS FORMAL REVIEW PROCESS SO WE CAN 
20:05:37 MAKE SURE WE'RE COMFORTABLE WITH THE LIST AND TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR US TO 
20:05:38 REMEMBER THAT WE'RE ON THE SAME SIDE.

20:05:42 WE'RE NOT ENEMIES LIKE IN AN ACTUAL MILITARY SITUATION.

20:05:43 THANK YOU.

20:05:50 >> THANK YOU.

20:05:54 KATHERINE?

20:05:54 >> HI.

20:06:02 I WAS KIND OF CONCERNED ABOUT THE PRESENTATION GIVEN TONIGHT BY THE 
20:06:03 CAPTAIN.

20:06:09 OVERALL, HE WAS MAKING IT SOUND LIKE FREMONT CITIZENS WERE GOING TO TAKE UP 
20:06:15 ARMS AND USE ARMOR PIERCING VESSELS TO ATTACK SOMEBODY OR THE POLICE, AND 
20:06:20 THEN HE WOULD BACK PEDAL AND SAY, WELL, WE WOULD ONLY USE IF WE ABSOLUTELY HAD 
20:06:20 TO.

20:06:26 UM, THAT'S VERY CONFUSING TO ME, AND I AGREE WITH ALL THE OTHER SPEAKERS 
20:06:32 AHEAD OF ME SAYING WE REALLY, REALLY, REALLY NEED TO BE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT 
20:06:37 WHAT WE'RE ACQUIRING, WHAT WE'RE  MAINTAINING, AND HOW WE'RE USING IT.

20:06:43 AND WHEN WE'RE USING IT, UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES COULD WE POSSIBLY NEED 
20:06:46 IN FREEMS FOR THIS KIND OF EQUIPMENT?

20:06:50 I JUST -- THIS IS VERY  CONCERNING TO ME TO THINK THAT THIS KIND OF 
20:06:52 EQUIPMENT WOULD BE NEEDED HERE.

20:07:00 I JUST -- I DON'T KNOW OF ANY SITUATIONS WHERE IT WAS NEEDED OR 
20:07:09 USED, AND SO I AM ALL FOR TRANSPARENCY AND US BEING TOLD WHEN IT WAS USED AND 
20:07:10 JUSTIFYING WHY IT WAS USED.

20:07:20 I AM VERY GLAD THAT COUNCILMEMBER COX BROUGHT UP THE FACT THAT THIS WAS NOT 
20:07:24 ABOUT ACQUIRING NEW EQUIPMENT BUT MAINTAINING THE OLD EQUIPMENT.

20:07:28 AND IN TERMS OF COST, IT STILL COSTS MONEY TO MAINTAIN THE EQUIPMENT THAT 
20:07:28 WE HAVE.

20:07:36 SO I WOULD LIKE FREMONT TO BE VERY CAUTIOUS ABOUT WHAT WE'RE ACQUIRING IN 
20:07:43 THE FUTURE AND WHAT WE'RE CHOOSING TO MAINTAIN CURRENTLY AND HOW WE'RE USING 
20:07:43  IF.

20:07:45   IT.

20:07:46 I YIELD THE REST OF MY TIME.

20:07:59 >> Mayor Mei: CHUNG IS THE NEXT SPEAKER.

20:08:08 CHUNG?

20:08:16 YOU'RE UNMUTED ALREADY.

20:08:18 CAN YOU PLEASE -- CHUNG?

20:08:25 HELLO?

20:08:34 I'M NOT SURE IF THE SPEAKER IS NOT --

20:08:37 >> Ms. Gauthier: IT'S UNMUTED AT OUR END, MADAME MAYOR.

20:08:37 >> Mayor Mei: OKAY.

20:08:41 WELL, MY APOLOGIES, IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE WE CAN HEAR THE INDIVIDUAL.

20:08:51 IF YOUR MIC IS NOT WORKING, I GUESS YOU COULD PUT IT -- I DON'T KNOW -- IS 
20:08:53 THERE A CHAT OPTION OR SOMETHING?

20:08:58 BECAUSE OTHERWISE WE TRIED  PULLING THE INDIVIDUAL --

20:09:00 >> Ms. Gauthier: WE DON'T USE CHAT.

20:09:04 >> Mayor Mei: SO AT THIS TIME, I'M GOING TO CLOSE THE PUBLIC COMMENT.

20:09:08 AND I'LL TURN IT BACK TO OUR COUNCIL FOR DISCUSSION.

20:09:18 I'LL BE HAPPY TO MAKE SOME COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS.

20:09:18 COUNCILMEMBER JONES.

20:09:22 >> Councilmember Jones: THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR, AND THANK  YOU, CHIEF 
20:09:22 WASHINGTON, FOR THE PRESENTATION.

20:09:29 YOU KNOW, I KNOW THAT OUR COMMUNITY AND OUR DEPARTMENT IS FOCUSED ON 
20:09:32 TRANSPARENCY AND  KNOWING WHAT EQUIPMENT IT IS THAT THE POLICE 
20:09:34 DEPARTMENT HAS AND HOW IT'S USED.

20:09:36 I THINK YOU COVERED THAT VERY WELL.

20:09:42 YOU KNOW, I THINK THERE IS SOME DISTINCTION BETWEEN WHAT SOME WOULD 
20:09:46 REFER TO AS MILITARY EQUIPMENT AND LAW ENFORCEMENT EQUIPMENT.

20:09:51 FOR INSTANCE, THE BEARCAT AND THE MEDCAT, WHILE THEY MAY LOOK LIKE 
20:09:58 MILITARY EQUIPMENT, THEY ARE STRICT LITTLE A -- BASICALLY A DEFENSIVE 
20:09:59 VEHICLE.

20:10:05 THOSE ARE USED IN EXTREME CIRCUMSTANCES AS YOU MENTIONED, THE MEDCAT IS 
20:10:09 EQUIPPED WITH MEDICAL SUPPLY AND A STRETCHER, GOES INTO SITUATIONS TO 
20:10:12 RESCUE EITHER CIVILIANS OR PUBLIC SAFETY PERSONNEL WHO HAVE BEEN INJURED 
20:10:16 IN AN ENVIRONMENT THAT IS NOT SAFE UNLESS THEY HAVE THAT TYPE OF 
20:10:16 PROTECTION.

20:10:23 JUST FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE AS A NEGOTIATOR WITH THE SWAT TEAM FOR A 
20:10:26 NUMBER OF YEARS, I APPRECIATED BEING ABLE TO GO INTO SITUATIONS AND KNOW 
20:10:31 THAT I WAS SAFE FROM A SUBJECT THAT I WAS NEGOTIATING WITH WHO WAS ARMED 
20:10:36 WITH A FIREARM, NOT A VERY COMFORTABLE FEELING TO BE HIDING BEHIND A CAR THAT 
20:10:42 A ROUND CAN GO THROUGH, BUT TO HAVE AN ARMORED VEHICLE TO BE ABLE TO GET 
20:10:49 CLOSE TO THAT SUBJECT AND ENGAGE IN A NEGOTIATION AND TO BRING TO A PEACEFUL 
20:10:51 RESOLUTION, THAT'S WHAT THIS EQUIPMENT IS ABOUT.

20:10:55 SO THOSE TWO ITEMS, I THINK IN PARTICULAR, ARE THE ONES THAT PROBABLY 
20:10:56 DRAWL THE MOST  SCRUTINY.

20:11:02 I KNOW THAT YOUR DEPARTMENT IS EXTREMELY WELL TRAINED AND PROBABLY 
20:11:05 HAS THE REPUTATION OF BEING ONE OF THE BETTER DEPARTMENTS IN CALIFORNIA IF 
20:11:07 NOT THE ENTIRE WEST COAST.

20:11:12 SO THANK YOU FOR ALL THAT YOU DO AND KEEPING OUR COMMUNITY ENGAGED.

20:11:16 >> THANK YOU, COUNCILMAN.

20:11:17 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

20:11:17 COUNCILMEMBER KENG.

20:11:21 >> Councilmember Keng: THANK  YOU, MADAME MAYOR, AND THANK YOU TO OUR 
20:11:23 POLICE CHIEF WASHINGTON FOR YOUR PRESENTATION.

20:11:29 AND I DO APPRECIATE ALL THE COMMUNITY MEMBERS THAT HAVE EXPRESSED YOUR 
20:11:37 CONCERNS AND ALSO THE TRANSPARENCIES THAT ARE NEEDED IN THE USAGE OF THESE 
20:11:37 ITEMS.

20:11:44 AND I DO AGREE THAT IT WAS GOOD THAT IT WAS CLARIFIED THAT THE LIST THAT WAS 
20:11:50 GIVEN TONIGHT ARE NOT NEW ITEMS THAT WE'RE  ACQUIRING BUT JUST AN INVENTORY 
20:11:58 OF CURRENT ITEMS THAT WE DO CARRY THAT ARE LISTED AS PART OF MILITARY 
20:12:05 EQUIPMENT, MILITARY GRADE, BUT SOME OF THESE ITEMS ARE -- THAT YOU COULD EVEN 
20:12:14 BUY ONLINE, LIKE THE DRONE OR -- AND THEN -- I DID ATTEND THE KIND OF TOUR 
20:12:22 AT THE POLICE DEPARTMENT THAT SHOWED US IN DETAIL EACH OF THESE ITEMS, MOST OF 
20:12:26 THESE  ITEMS, WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE, WHAT THEY'RE USED FOR, UNDER WHAT 
20:12:33 CIRCUMSTANCES, AND I HAD AN UNDERSTANDING WHERE SOME OF THESE 
20:12:40 ITEMS, INCLUDING ITEMS THAT ARE USED SO THAT THEY CAN BE SENT AHEAD OF OUR 
20:12:46 OFFICERS  TO, FOR EXAMPLE, BREAK A LOCK, BREAK A DOOR, SO THAT OUR 
20:12:54 OFFICERS CAN COMPLETE THE MISSION IN THE SAFEST MANNER AND ALSO BE ABLE TO 
20:13:04 COMPLETE THE WORK AND BRING HOSTAGES OR BE ABLE TO CONSTANTLY -- THE LEAST 
20:13:11 HARM TO ALL PEOPLE THAT ARE INVOLVED, SO I APPRECIATE THAT DETAILED 
20:13:15 PRESENTATION THAT WAS GIVEN AT THE POLICE DEPARTMENT, AND SO MY HUSBAND 
20:13:25 SERVED IN THE U.S. MARINE, AND WE SEE THAT IN OTHER CITIES, WE HAVE SEEN 
20:13:33 SOME DOMESTIC TERRORISM WHERE VERY DANGEROUS SITUATIONS BE WERE POSED AND 
20:13:41  HOPEFULLY WE DON'T NEED TO USE MOST OF THESE ITEMS AT ALL, BUT IN CASE OF 
20:13:47 DANGEROUS SITUATIONS AND I CAN THINK OF -- I CAN SHARE WITH YOU ALL THAT, FOR 
20:13:53 EXAMPLE, IN THE LAST COUPLE YEARS, WE HAD IN PARTS OF FREMONT IN ARDENWOOD, 
20:14:01 FOR EXAMPLE, THERE WERE THESE SIDE SHOWS WHERE HUNDREDS OF CARS HAD 
20:14:08 GATHERED IN A FEW BLOCKS,  BLOCKED ALL THE STREET AND THERE WERE RESIDENTS 
20:14:14 WHO WILL TRY TO FILM THE EVENT AND SEND VIDEOS TO OUR POLICE DEPARTMENT AND 
20:14:22 THERE WERE PEOPLE WHO WERE DRIVING AND PEOPLE WERE -- HAD WEAPONS AND TRY TO 
20:14:28 TAKE THOSE -- TAKE THE PHONES, SO THERE WERE SITUATIONS LIKE THIS THAT COULD 
20:14:35 QUICKLY TURN DANGEROUS, AND SO WE -- IN THESE SITUATIONS, OF COURSE, WE 
20:14:41 MONITOR THEM AND THEN HOPEFULLY, YOU KNOW, WE CAN MAKE THE BEST DECISION TO 
20:14:42 KEEP OUR COMMUNITY SAFE.

20:14:48 SO I DO APPRECIATE OUR POLICE CHIEF MAKING THIS PRESENTATION, MAKING THE 
20:15:00 DETAILED LIST OF THE ITEMS THAT ARE BEING USED, AND I DO ALSO WANT TO HAVE 
20:15:09 MORE TRANSPARENCY AS THESE ITEMS ARE BEING USED, HOW CAN WE HAVE A REPORT 
20:15:11 ON A TIMELY MANNER WHEN THESE ITEMS ARE USED.

20:15:11 THANK YOU.

20:15:15 >> THANK YOU, COUNCILMEMBER.

20:15:18 >> Mayor Mei: COUNCILMEMBER  SHAO.

20:15:20 >> Councilmember Shao: THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR.

20:15:24 THANK YOU, VERY MUCH, CHIEF WASHINGTON, FOR GIVING THIS PRESENTATION.

20:15:31 YOUR DEPARTMENT SETS A VERY GOOD EXAMPLE FOR EVERYONE IN FREMONT JUST 
20:15:36 TO SHOW HOW YOU WOULD BE  DOING YOUR BEST TO FOLLOW THE LAW, EVEN THOUGH 
20:15:44 THIS LAW, TO  ME, NEEDS A LOT OF IMPROVEMENT.

20:15:48 IT'S VERY FAR REACHING, OVERREACHING.

20:15:57 THIS, I TREAT AS A GOOD OPPORTUNITY FOR PUBLIC KNOWLEDGE THAT OUR POLICE 
20:16:06 DEPARTMENT IS NOT MILITARIZED, EVEN THOAL SOME OF THE EQUIPMENT YOU USE IS 
20:16:10 ARGUABLY CHARACTERIZED AS MILITARY EQUIPMENT.

20:16:17 FOR EXAMPLE, THE UAVs THAT ARE READILY AVAILABLE ONLINE FROM AMAZON FOR 
20:16:25 EVERYONE, BUT AS LONG AS IT'S IN YOUR CUSTODY, SUDDENLY IT BECOMES MILITARY 
20:16:26 EQUIPMENT.

20:16:32 HOPEFULLY THE TESLA THAT I  DRIVE, THE SAME TESLA CAR WOULD NEVER BECOME 
20:16:37 MILITARY EQUIPMENT SINCE WE DO HAVE TESLA PATROL CARS IN YOUR DEPARTMENT.

20:16:45 SO I APPRECIATE THIS  OPPORTUNITY, AND I ALSO APPRECIATE THE CLOSE 
20:16:52 RELATIONSHIP AND THE SUPPORT FROM THE COMMUNITY TO THE POLICE DEPARTMENT.

20:17:02 YOUR TRACK RECORD ALREADY SHOWED THAT YOU HAVE PERFECT JUDGMENT IN NOT ONLY 
20:17:09 MAINTAINING THOSE EQUIPMENT BUT ALSO USING SUCH EQUIPMENT WISELY IN YOUR 
20:17:15 ROUTINE PRACTICE TO KEEP OUR PUBLIC SAFETY.

20:17:16 SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY.

20:17:23 >> THANK YOU, SIR.

20:17:27 >> Mayor Mei: NEXT IS COUNCILMEMBER COX, AND THEN I DON'T KNOW IF 
20:17:30 COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN HAS COMMENTS, BUT I'LL CLOSE IF THERE ARE NONE.

20:17:32 >> Councilmember Cox: THANK YOU.

20:17:38 I DID WANT TO ASK A QUESTION TO OUR POLICE CHIEF WASHINGTON.

20:17:52 ONCE THIS GETS FINALIZED, THIS LIST, WITH THE ORDINANCE, I  WANTED TO 
20:17:58 UNDERSTAND IF YOU REPORT OUT FOR NEXT YEAR, FOR NEXT YEAR'S ANNUAL REPORT, 
20:18:04 WILL THERE BE A NOTATION NEXT TO THE EQUIPMENT TO DISTINGUISH WHICH IS A 
20:18:09 NEW ADDITIONAL EQUIPMENT THAT WAS NOT ON THE LIST FOR THIS YEAR THAT APPEARS 
20:18:17 ON THE LIST, AND WHENEVER IT WAS DOCUMENTED THAT IT WAS APPROVED AT 
20:18:26 CITY COUNCIL, AND THEN THE OTHER PART WOULD BE IF YOU DECOMMISSION THE 
20:18:29 POLICE EQUIPMENT, IT WOULD THEN BE NOTED ON THAT AS WELL THAT IT'S BEEN 
20:18:30 REMOVED.

20:18:36 ORTHOS ARE THINGS THAT I KNOW YOU'RE ADOPTING THIS POLICY, BUT I JUST WANT 
20:18:45 TO MAKE SURE IT'S CLEAR WITH THE PUBLIC AND MAKING SURE THAT WE KNOW WHAT 
20:18:50 STAYED ON, WHAT CHANGE FROM THIS YEAR TO THE PREVIOUS YEAR, AND THEN TAKING, 
20:18:55 I GUESS KEEPING A REVISION HISTORY OR SOMETHING OF WHAT HAS HAPPENED SO WE 
20:18:56 ALWAYS HAVE SOMETHING TO GO BACK TO.

20:19:02 SO JUST TRYING TO ARCHIVE AND JUST MAKE SURE I UNDERSTAND THAT PART OF THE 
20:19:02 PROCESS.

20:19:08 >> YES, AND THEUP FOR THAT COMMENT AND QUESTION.

20:19:10 ABSOLUTELY, THAT'S GOING TO BE PART OF THE REPORT.

20:19:15 ANYTHING THAT WE HAVE THAT'S NEW, IT WILL BE VERY CLEAR THAT THIS IS WHERE 
20:19:20 WE STARTED AND THIS IS WHERE WE'D LIKE TO GO AND THIS IS WHERE WE ARE RIGHT 
20:19:20 NOW.

20:19:25 SO THAT ITEM OR PIECE OF EQUIPMENT WILL STAND OUT AND BE CLEARLY IDENTIFIED AS 
20:19:29 A NEW PIECE OF EQUIPMENT FOR, LET'S JUST CALL IT 2023, RIGHT, OR WHATEVER 
20:19:37 WE ACQUIRE THAT PIECE OF EQUIPMENT, AND THEN TO YOUR POINT, IF WE NO LONGER 
20:19:40 NEEDED A PIECE OF EQUIPMENT OR WE FELT LIKE THERE WAS A BETTER PIECE OF 
20:19:45 EQUIPMENT OR IT NO LONGER DID THE JOB, THEN WE WOULD MAKE THAT VERY CLEAR IN 
20:19:49 THE REPORT AS WELL, THAT WE NO LONGER USE THAT EQUIPMENT AND THE STATUS OF 
20:19:55 IT, RIGHT, WHAT DID WE DO WITH IT, DID WE JUST HAVE IT AND NOT EMPLOY IT OR 
20:20:02 DID WE GET RID OF IT OR DESTROY IT OR WHATEVER THE OUTCOME WAS, WE NEED TO 
20:20:03 MAKE THAT VERY CLEAR.

20:20:04 >> OKAY.

20:20:16 AND ALSO JUST ADDING IN, IN THE CASE OF A CLASSIFICATION TO NOW BEING 
20:20:22 CATEGORIZED UNDER THE  AB -- THAT IT CHANGED IT NOT BECAUSE YOU ACQUIRED 
20:20:26 IT, IT WAS ALREADY THERE, OR -- SOME CLASSIFICATION CHANGE BUT JUST KIND OF 
20:20:27 MAKING THAT CLEAR AS WELL.

20:20:31 AS THINGS DO CHANGE WITH POLICIES AS WE ALL KNOW.

20:20:32 >> SURE.

20:20:33 ABSOLUTELY.

20:20:35 WE WILL ADJUST ACCORDINGLY.

20:20:41 IF ANY OF THOSE CATEGORIES CHANGE MOVING FORWARD, WE'LL MAKE THAT 
20:20:42 ADJUSTMENT.

20:20:43 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

20:20:44 THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

20:20:49 >> THANK YOU, COUNCILMEMBER.

20:20:50 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

20:20:52 THEUM FOR THIS REPORT.

20:20:58 I DO APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT EACH OF THE COUNCILMEMBERS WAS OFFERED, AND I 
20:21:00 KNOW THAT WE HAVE NOT HAD THE OPPORTUNITY AS IN THE PAST SOMETIMES 
20:21:09 WITH THE PUBLIC SAFETY FAIR AND WE ALSO HAVE THE POLICE VOLUNTEER TRAINING, I 
20:21:14 KNOW THAT WE'VE HAD THAT IN THE PAST FOR CITIZENS TO BE GIVEN THAT 
20:21:18 OPPORTUNITY TO BE TRAINED IF THEY'D LIKE TO HELP SUPPORT, WE HAVEN'T HAD 
20:21:21 THAT -- CITIZENS ACADEMY IN THE PAST.

20:21:28 BUT I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT AND IT'S GLAD THAT WE ARE DOCUMENTING IT AND 
20:21:30 CLARIFYING AS TO WHAT IS DEFINED.

20:21:34 I APPRECIATE THE CLARIFICATION, BUT NOTE THAT WE ALREADY HAD THIS 
20:21:40 EQUIPMENT AND IT'S  MAINTAINING, OF COURSE, I  ALSO -- IN PARTICULAR I 
20:21:47 AGREE WITH COUNCILMEMBER JONES ABOUT SOME OF THE VEHICLES AND IN 
20:21:52 PARTICULAR, THE BEARCAT AND THE MEDCAT, THE THINK THE BEAR KS CAT MOSTLY HAS 
20:21:54 BEEN IN OTHER FUNCTIONS IN THE COMMUNITY TOO.

20:21:58 IT IS AN EMPTY ARMORED VEHICLE THAT ALLOWS US TO GET CLOSE, BUT WE HAVE 
20:22:04 HAD IT OUT IN THE PUBLIC FOR DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS TOO SO PEOPLE CAN SEE AND 
20:22:05 TOUR INSIDE THE VEHICLE.

20:22:08 I WOULD SUPPORT THE IDEA THAT AS AMENDMENTS ARE MADE TO THIS 
20:22:14 LEGISLATION, IF THERE ARE ANY THAT REFLECT THAT ON OUR UPDATES IN TERMS 
20:22:24 OF ANY CHANGES OR ANY EQUIPMENT THAT IS EITHER DECOMMISSIONED OR NOTED, I'D 
20:22:32 ALSO AGREE IN TERMS OF -- I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE ARBITRARY ONE MONTH OR 
20:22:35 WHATEVER TIME FRAME BECAUSE I WOULD THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WOULD BE 
20:22:38 CON TINGE JET WOULD BE COMPLETION OF AN ACTIVE INVESTIGATION.

20:22:43 IDEALLY WE WANT TO REPORT TO OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS SOONER RATHER THAN 
20:22:49 LATER, AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE -- SO I WOULD BE -- 
20:22:55 HAVING SOME SORT OF A MOTOR, WHETHER AT MINIMUM IF POSSIBLE AND OIL DEFER THAT 
20:22:58 TO STAFF, OUR CITY MANAGER AND YOURSELF, BUT AT MINIMUM QUARTERLY IF 
20:23:03 THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS UTILIZED OR AS PART OF OUR REPORT OUT OF A 
20:23:07 COMPLETE POLICE INVESTIGATION, THAT IT WOULD NOTE SO.

20:23:12 AND I THINK THAT WOULD COVER -- AND ALSO ENSURE THAT THE PUBLIC HAS FAITH 
20:23:13 AND AWARENESS OF THAT.

20:23:19 BUT I WILL DEFER THAT TO ALL OF YOU IN TERMS OF OUR ONLY DWECT REPORTS AS A 
20:23:23 COUNCIL ARE THE CITY MANAGER AND THE CITY ATTORNEY, BUT WE CERTAINLY HAVE 
20:23:27 GUIDANCE AND WE KNOW WE HAVE THE SUPPORT AND PARTNERSHIP WITH THE 
20:23:28 POLICE AS WELL AS FIRE.

20:23:29 SO APPRECIATE THIS.

20:23:32 AND WITH THAT, I WAS GOING TO SAY, WE ACCEPT THE REPORT.

20:23:36 WE ALSO HAVE SEVERAL AGENDA  ITEMS YET, BUT --

20:23:40 >> Ms. Gauthier: WE HAVE TO VOTE ON THIS, I BELIEVE, MAYOR.

20:23:44 >> MY APOLOGIES --

20:23:46 >> Mayor Mei: THERE'S AN ORDINANCE TOO.

20:23:49 >> IT'S AN ORDINANCE SO I WILL READ THE TITLE INTO THE RECORD WHEN YOU'RE 
20:23:49 READY.

20:23:53 >> Councilmember Jones: MADAME MAYOR, I MOVE TO APPROVE THE RECOMMENDED 
20:23:54 ORDINANCE.

20:23:55 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU, COUNCILMEMBER JONES.

20:23:58 SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER SHAO.

20:24:00 >> Councilmember Shao: I SECOND.

20:24:05 >> Mayor Mei: AND RAFAEL, OUR CITY ATTORNEY, IF YOU COULD BE SO KIND AS 
20:24:06 TO READ THE ORDINANCE NOW.

20:24:08 >> I WILL READ THE TITLE INTO THE RECORD.

20:24:13 ONE CLARIFYING QUESTION FOR COUNCILMEMBER JONES, TO CLARIFY, 
20:24:16 COUNCILMEMBER JONES, IS YOUR MOTION TO ACCEPT THE FULL RECOMMENDATION MEANING 
20:24:18 THE THREE SUBPARTS?

20:24:19 >> Councilmember Jones: CORRECT.

20:24:20 >> THANK YOU.

20:24:26 I'LL READ THE TITLE INTO THE RECORD, AN ORDINANCE OF THE CITY OF FREMONT 
20:24:33 ADDING FREMONT MUNICIPAL CODE TITLE 8 HEALTH AND SAFETY CHAPTER 8.80 
20:24:34 MILITARY EQUIPMENT USE POLICY.

20:24:36 THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR -- MAYOR.

20:24:38 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

20:24:40 WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND.

20:24:42 MOTION BY COUNCILMEMBER JONES AND SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER SHAO.

20:25:06 >> Mayor Mei: THE MOTION PASSES UNANIMOUSLY.

20:25:13 NEXT ON OUR AGENDA ITEM WILL BE ITEM 7A, BUT I AM CERTAIN THAT THIS ITEM 
20:25:16 WILL TAKE MORE THAN THE NEXT FIVE MINUTE TO HAVE THE CONVERSATION AND TO 
20:25:20 ENSURE THAT WE HAVE THE PUBLIC FEEDBACK, SO I'M GOING TO CALL A BREAK 
20:25:24 FOR 10 MINUTES TO GIVE OUR STENOCAPTIONER THE TIME AND THEN WE'LL 
20:25:30 RETURN IN 10 MINUTES TO ITEM 7A, PAP PARKWAY STREET DESIGN.

20:25:35 I'D LIKE TO ASK IF YOU'RE ON THIS BREAK TO PLEASE TURN OFF YOUR MICS AND YOUR 
20:25:37 VIDEO DURING THIS BREAK AND WE'LL RETURN IN 10 MINUTES.

20:25:38 THANK YOU SO MUCH.

20:25:43 



20:25:43 



20:35:43 [ RECESS ]

20:35:44 >> Mayor Mei:   WELCOME BACK.

20:36:39 BUT -- WELCOME BACK THE NEXT 

20:36:40 AGENDA ITEM THAT WE'LL BE

20:36:51 COVERING WILL BE ITEM 7A WHICH 

20:36:53 IS PASEO PADRE PARKWAY STREET 

20:36:56 DESIGN.

20:37:00 AND I THINK THIS IS PUBLIC WORKS

20:37:03 PRESENTING A PRESENTATION, 

20:37:04 SHARING A PRESENTATION, THANK 

20:37:05 YOU.

20:37:08 >> Hans Larsen:   GREAT, GOOD 

20:37:10 EVENING, MAYOR MEI AND MEMBERS 

20:37:11 OF THE COUNCIL.

20:37:12 THE PURPOSE OF THIS AGENDA ITEM 

20:37:14 IS TO RECEIVE YOUR DIRECTION 

20:37:16 HERE TONIGHT ON STREET DESIGN 

20:37:19 ELEMENTS FOR PASEO PADRE PARKWAY 

20:37:22 IN THE AREA BETWEEN DRISCOLL 

20:37:23 ROAD AND WASHINGTON BOULEVARD.

20:37:25 AS YOU RECALL, THIS IS AN ITEM 

20:37:27 THAT WAS LAST DISCUSSED BY THE 

20:37:31 COUNCIL IN SEPTEMBER OF 2021, 

20:37:32 APPROXIMATELY SIX MONTHS AGO.

20:37:35 AND AT THAT TIME, YOU APPROVED 

20:37:37 SOME INTERIM DIRECTION ON THIS 

20:37:39 TOPIC AND ASKED STAFF TO RETURN 

20:37:41 IN SIX MONTHS WITH FURTHER 

20:37:43 ANALYSIS AND COMMUNITY INPUT.

20:37:47 THIS ITEM HAS GENERATED QUITE A 

20:37:49 SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF COMMUNITY 

20:37:50 INPUT.

20:37:53 WE SURVEYED THE COMMUNITY FOR 

20:37:55 THEIR IDEAS AND LISTENED TO 

20:37:58 THEIR CONCERNS ABOUT STREET 

20:37:59 DESIGN ISSUES IN THIS AREA.

20:38:02 WE HELD A COMMUNITY MEETING ON 

20:38:03 APRIL 7th.

20:38:05 AND I UNDERSTAND THERE'S ABOUT 

20:38:07 80 E-MAIL MESSAGES THAT HAVE 

20:38:08 BEEN RECEIVED BY THE COUNCIL 

20:38:09 THAT ARE PART OF THE PUBLIC 

20:38:12 RECORD HERE TONIGHT.

20:38:13 AND I EXPECT THERE'S MANY 

20:38:14 SPEAKERS THAT WANT TO SHARE 

20:38:16 THEIR THOUGHTS WITH YOU HERE AS 

20:38:18 WELL.

20:38:19 I'D CERTAINLY APPRECIATE 

20:38:21 EVERYONE WHO HAS PARTICIPATED IN 

20:38:24 THIS TOPIC, IT IS SOMEWHAT 

20:38:25 CONTROVERSIAL, LOT OF STRONG 

20:38:27 OPINIONS, ON WHAT'S THE RIGHT 

20:38:29 THING TO DO HERE.

20:38:33 AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO COUNCIL'S 

20:38:35 REVIEW AND THE DISCUSSION AND TO 

20:38:37 PROVIDE US WITH POLICY DIRECTION 

20:38:39 AS PART OF THIS AGENDA ITEM.

20:38:42 LET ME START BY JUST KIND OF 

20:38:44 PROVIDING SOME BACKGROUND, IN 

20:38:47 TERMS OF TRANSPORTATION GOALS 

20:38:49 THAT WE'VE ADOPTED AS A CITY.

20:38:51 AND THESE ARE ALL CONTAINED IN 

20:38:53 THE MOBILITY ACTION PLAN THAT 

20:38:56 WAS APPROVED IN 2019.

20:38:58 AND OF THE ELEMENTS OF THE 

20:38:59 MOBILITY ACTION PLAN THAT ARE 

20:39:01 RELEVANT TO THIS TOPIC HERE 

20:39:04 TONIGHT ARE THESE INCLUDED ON 

20:39:05 THE SLIDES.

20:39:07 SO FIRST OFF WE WANT TO IMPROVE 

20:39:09 TRAFFIC SAFETY IN OUR COMMUNITY 

20:39:11 WHICH IS PART OF OUR VISION ZERO 

20:39:12 POLICY.

20:39:15 AND THE GOAL IS TO REDUCE FATAL 

20:39:17 AND SEVERE INJURY TRAFFIC 

20:39:17 CRASHES.

20:39:22 ALSO, WE HAVE A COMPLETE STREETS 

20:39:26 POLICY WHICH IT IS IN ESSENCE AN 

20:39:28 EQUITY AND MOBILITY POLICY AND 

20:39:30 THE GOAL HERE IS TO DESIGN OUR 

20:39:31 STREETS THAT SERVE ALL TRAVEL 

20:39:34 MODES BY ALL AGES AND ABILITIES.

20:39:36 AND PARTICULARLY TO IMPROVE 

20:39:38 FACILITIES FOR PEOPLE WALKING, 

20:39:40 BIKING AND TRANSIT, AND THEN WE 

20:39:43 ALSO HAVE A POLICY TO ENCOURAGE 

20:39:45 MORE PEOPLE TO TRAVEL BY 

20:39:47 WALKING, BIKING AND TRANSIT AND 

20:39:52 REDUCE THE RELIANCE ON DRIVING 

20:39:53 IN VEHICLES.

20:39:54 RELATED TO THIS WE HAVE A 

20:39:56 FOCUSED POLICY RELATED TO SAFE 

20:39:58 ROUTES TO SCHOOL, AND THAT IS 

20:40:00 DESIGNED TO FACILITATE MORE 

20:40:02 PEOPLE WALKING AND BIKING TO 

20:40:03 SCHOOL.

20:40:05 AND THEN THE FOURTH ITEM OF 

20:40:07 SIGNIFICANCE IS OUR MOBILITY 

20:40:10 ACTION PLAN IS A BALANCED PLAN, 

20:40:12 IS THAT WE WANT TO SERVE 

20:40:13 EVERYONE THAT'S MOVING AROUND 

20:40:15 FREMONT INCLUDING PEOPLE THAT 

20:40:17 DRIVE, AND WE RECOGNIZE THAT WE 

20:40:19 HAVE AN OLD TRAFFIC SIGNAL 

20:40:21 SYSTEM AND WE CAN IMPROVE 

20:40:23 TRAFFIC FLOW AND EFFICIENCY BY 

20:40:25 UPGRADING THE SYSTEM WITH NEW 

20:40:27 MODERN TECHNOLOGY, AND AS PART 

20:40:29 OF THAT WE CAN ALSO GIVE 

20:40:31 PRIORITY TO EMERGENCY VEHICLES 

20:40:33 THROUGH OUR TRAFFIC SIGNAL 

20:40:34 SYSTEM.

20:40:35 SO THESE ARE ALL THE THINGS THAT 

20:40:39 WE'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH WITH 

20:40:41 THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT OR AT 

20:40:43 LEAST CONSIDER, AS WELL AS 

20:40:45 THINGS THAT WE ARE STRIVING TO 

20:40:47 IMPROVE ACROSS THE CITY OF 

20:40:47 FREMONT.

20:40:50 THE AREA OF PASEO PADRE PARKWAY 

20:40:52 BETWEEN DRISCOLL AND WASHINGTON 

20:40:55 HAS BEEN FLAGGED AS AN AREA OF 

20:40:56 CONCERN REGARDING TRAFFIC 

20:40:56 SAFETY.

20:41:07 WE HAVE A RELATIVELY HIGH NUMBER 

20:41:08 OF CRASHES THAT HAVE BEEN 

20:41:09 REPORTED AROUND HERE AND THAT'S 

20:41:11 WHY IT COMES UP AS A HOT SPOT 

20:41:12 FOR ATTENTION.

20:41:13 AND ONE OF THE UNIQUE 

20:41:15 CONSIDERATIONS IN HERE IS THE 

20:41:17 ALIGNMENT OF THE ROADWAY, IT HAS 

20:41:23 SEVERAL CURVES THE IT, IT HAS A 

20:41:25 DOWNHILL GRADE, IT ALSO HAS A 

20:41:27 RESIDENTIAL CHARACTER WITH LOTS 

20:41:29 OF DRIVEWAYS AND ACCESS POINTS 

20:41:30 WHICH IS SOMEWHAT UNIQUE FOR A 

20:41:32 ROADWAY IN FREMONT THAT IS FOUR 

20:41:33 LANES WIDE.

20:41:36 SO THIS HAS BEEN A PROBLEM AREA, 

20:41:38 28 CRASHES OVER THE LAST FIVE 

20:41:44 YEARS, FORTUNATELY, THERE HAVE 

20:41:46 NOT BEEN ANY FATAL CRASHES BUT 

20:41:48 OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS THERE 

20:41:51 HAVE BEEN HIGH PRO FIGHT CRASHES 

20:41:53 WHICH ARE ILLUSTRATED IN THE 

20:41:53 PICTURES TO THE RIGHT.

20:41:55 THE BIG ISSUE WE HEAR IN THIS 

20:41:56 CORRIDOR IS PEOPLE ARE DRIVING 

20:41:58 WAY TOO FAST AND THE DATA THAT 

20:42:01 WE HAVE DONE JUST THIS LAST 

20:42:03 MONTH HAS PROVEN OUT THAT TOO 

20:42:05 MANY PEOPLE ARE DRIVING 

20:42:06 SIGNIFICANTLY OVER THE SPEED 

20:42:07 LIMIT.

20:42:13 16% OF THE PEOPLE ARE TRAVELING 

20:42:17 AT LEAST TEN MILES AN HOUR OVER 

20:42:21 THE SPEED LIMIT, WITH MANY 

20:42:23 PEOPLE GOING 20 MILES AN HOUR 

20:42:25 OVER THE SPEED LIMIT, INCREDIBLY 

20:42:28 WE HAVE SOME PEOPLE GOING 30 

20:42:29 MILES AN HOUR OVER THE SPEED 

20:42:30 LIMIT.

20:42:32 JUST WANT TO STEP BACK A LITTLE 

20:42:34 BIT AND RECAP THE PAST HISTORY.

20:42:36 THIS CORRIDOR IS IDENTIFIED FOR 

20:42:38 IMPROVEMENT PRIMARILY THROUGH A 

20:42:39 ROAD DIET WHERE WE WOULD REDUCE 

20:42:41 THE NUMBER OF LANES FROM FOUR TO 

20:42:41 TWO.

20:42:43 AND WE CONSIDERED DOING THIS 

20:42:45 WHEN WE HAVE MAJOR PAVEMENT 

20:42:47 MAINTENANCE WORK ON A PARTICULAR 

20:42:48 ROADWAY.

20:42:50 AND IN ESSENCE THIS IS AN 

20:42:53 OPPORTUNITY TO ESSENTIALLY NO 

20:42:55 COST, WHEN WE'RE RESURFACING A 

20:42:57 STREET WE CAN PUT IN NEW STRIPES 

20:43:00 IN A DIFFERENT CONFIGURATION 

20:43:02 THAT PROMOTES OUR OTHER GOALS 

20:43:04 PARTICULARLY AROUND SAFETY AND 

20:43:04 COMPLETE STREETS.

20:43:06 AT THE TIME THE STREET WAS DUE 

20:43:07 FOR PAVEMENT MAINTENANCE IT WAS 

20:43:09 ALSO A TIME WHERE THERE WAS A 

20:43:11 LOT OF TRAFFIC CONGESTION IN THE 

20:43:14 CORRIDOR DUE TO REGIONAL 

20:43:15 CUT-THROUGH TRAFFIC AND AS A 

20:43:16 RESULT OF THAT CONCERN THE 

20:43:18 DIRECTION WAS TO DEFER ACTION ON 

20:43:21 CHANGING THE STREET UNTIL 680 

20:43:24 WAS WIDENED IN THE SUNOL GRADE 

20:43:27 AREA WHICH WOULD RELIEVE TRAFFIC 

20:43:28 CONGESTION PARTICULARLY AT THE 

20:43:31 680-WASHINGTON INTERCHANGE.

20:43:33 THAT PROJECT WAS COMPLETED IN 

20:43:34 2020.

20:43:35 WE BROUGHT THIS PROJECT BACK 

20:43:39 AGAIN TO COUNCIL IN 2021.

20:43:42 THERE WAS CONTINUED CONCERNS 

20:43:44 ABOUT WHETHER WE WERE READY TO 

20:43:45 MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS.

20:43:46 AND IT WAS ACKNOWLEDGED THAT 

20:43:48 WE'RE IN A SITUATION WHERE 

20:43:51 TRAFFIC VOLUMES WERE VERY 

20:43:53 UNSTABLE, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE 

20:43:55 EFFECTS OF THE COVID PANDEMIC.

20:44:00 AND SO COUNCIL DIRECTED AN 

20:44:02 INTERIM IMPROVEMENT IN WHICH WE 

20:44:04 WOULD NARROW THE LANES AND THEN 

20:44:06 ADD A BASIC BIKE LANE TO THE 

20:44:08 CORRIDOR WHICH WAS MISSING AND 

20:44:09 THEN PROVIDED DIRECTION TO COME 

20:44:11 BACK IN SIX MONTHS TO REEVALUATE 

20:44:13 IT, WHICH IS WHAT BRINGS US HERE 

20:44:13 TONIGHT.

20:44:20 SO THIS IS A VISUAL OF HOW THE 

20:44:22 CORRIDOR HAS LOOKED PRIOR TO THE 

20:44:23 RECENT MODIFICATION.

20:44:25 SO THIS IS A FOUR LANE STREET, 

20:44:27 TWO LANES IN EACH DIRECTION, NO 

20:44:29 BIKE FACILITIES, ONSTREET 

20:44:31 PARKING AND YOU CAN SEE THIS IS 

20:44:33 AN AREA WITH VERY MUCH A 

20:44:34 NEIGHBORHOOD CHARACTER WITH 

20:44:38 FREQUENTLY SPACED DRIVE WAYS FOR 

20:44:40 ACCESS TO THE COMMUNITY THAT 

20:44:41 LIVES ALONG THE CORRIDOR.

20:44:45 AND SO EARLY THIS YEAR, WE 

20:44:47 MODIFIED IT BASED ON THE 

20:44:48 PREVIOUS COUNCIL DIRECTION, 

20:44:50 NARROWED THE TRAVEL LANES, ADDED 

20:44:54 A BASIC BIKE LANE, AND SO THAT 

20:44:55 IS WHAT'S IN PLACE TODAY.

20:45:01 AND THEN UNDER CONSIDERATION IS 

20:45:02 WHETHER WE WANT TO CONTINUE WITH 

20:45:04 IT OR MODIFY IT IN SOME WAY.

20:45:06 IN OUR EVALUATION, WE ARE 

20:45:09 PROPOSING, AGAIN, TO CONSIDER 

20:45:11 THE ROAD DIET WHICH WOULD TAKE 

20:45:14 IT DOWN TO ONE LANE IN EACH 

20:45:14 DIRECTION.

20:45:16 WHAT THIS WOULD PROVIDE IS 

20:45:19 BENEFITS IN TERMS OF LOWERING 

20:45:19 SPEED.

20:45:20 SO FOLKS THAT ARE DRIVING THE 

20:45:23 SPEED LIMIT WOULD ESSENTIALLY 

20:45:25 CONTROL THE FLOW OF TRAFFIC 

20:45:26 THROUGH THE CORRIDOR AND NOT 

20:45:28 HAVE AN ADDITIONAL LANE WHERE 

20:45:30 PEOPLE CAN USE IT FOR SPEEDING 

20:45:31 AND PASSING.

20:45:33 TWO LANES IS EASIER FOR 

20:45:35 PEDESTRIANS TO CROSS.

20:45:35 PARTICULARLY FOLKS THAT ARE 

20:45:37 TRYING TO GET TO THE LOCAL 

20:45:38 SCHOOLS.

20:45:40 OBVIOUSLY THERE IS A MUCH BETTER 

20:45:42 BIKE LANE THAT'S PROVIDED.

20:45:43 IT'S WIDER.

20:45:44 IT HAS BUFFERS.

20:45:47 AND THEN IT ALSO PROVIDES SAFER 

20:45:50 AND EASIER ACCESS FOR FOLKS THAT 

20:45:51 LIVE WITHIN THE COMMUNITY TO 

20:45:52 HAVE THE ABILITY TO GET IN AND 

20:45:54 OUT OF THEIR DRIVEWAYS WITH MORE 

20:45:55 SPACE AND ROOM AND FOR THOSE 

20:45:57 THAT ARE PARKED ON THE STREET 

20:45:59 THEY ALSO HAVE MORE SPACE TO 

20:46:00 ACCESS THEIR VEHICLES.

20:46:08 JUST WANTED TO ADD A LIMB 

20:46:09 CONTEXT ABOUT ROAD DIETS.

20:46:11 THIS IS CONSIDERED A NATIONAL 

20:46:14 BEST PRACTICES AND THIS SLIDE 

20:46:16 HERE ISSUES A PAGE OUT OF THE 

20:46:18 SAFETY PLAY BOOK OUT OF THE 

20:46:20 FEDERAL HIGHWAY ADMINISTRATION 

20:46:23 ON TRAFFIC SAFETY AND 

20:46:24 IMPROVEMENT COUNTERMEASURES.

20:46:25 THIS IS SOMETHING THEY DO 

20:46:26 ENCOURAGE AND BENEFITS ARE THAT 

20:46:29 IT ALLOWS FOR BUILDING COMPLETE 

20:46:32 STREETS WITHIN THE COMMUNITY, 

20:46:34 THAT SERVES ALL ROAD USERS, 

20:46:36 FEWER LANES FOR PEOPLE TO CROSS 

20:46:38 BOTH DRIVING AND WALKING.

20:46:40 IT DOES PROVIDE A TRAFFIC 

20:46:43 CALMING EFFECT AND IF IT'S DONE 

20:46:44 TOGETHER WITH PAVEMENT 

20:46:46 MAINTENANCE WORK IT CAN BE DONE 

20:46:49 AT A LOW COST.

20:46:51 AND THEY'RE SUGGESTING THAT THIS 

20:46:52 CAN BE CONSIDERED ON STREETS 

20:46:54 THAT CARRY CURRENTLY OR 

20:46:56 PROJECTED TO CARRY LESS THAN 

20:46:57 25,000 VEHICLES.

20:47:02 SO I THINK KIND OF THE KEY 

20:47:04 QUESTION IS, WELL, HOW DOES THIS 

20:47:05 FIT WITHIN FREMONT?

20:47:08 WHAT'S THE PROJECTED AMOUNT OF 

20:47:11 TRAFFIC THAT PASEO PADRE PARKWAY 

20:47:12 CARRIES NOW?

20:47:13 OR INTO THE FUTURE?

20:47:16 OR HAS CARRIED AT ITS PEAK LEVEL 

20:47:18 AND IT'S CERTAINLY WELL WITHIN 

20:47:20 THE NATIONAL GUIDANCE FOR 

20:47:21 CONSIDERING A ROAD FOR ONE LANE 

20:47:23 IN EACH DIRECTION.

20:47:25 THIS SLIDE HERE SHOWS OTHER 

20:47:27 STREETS WHERE WE HAVE 

20:47:29 IMPLEMENTED ROAD DIETS, AND WE 

20:47:31 BELIEVE THAT THEY'VE BEEN 

20:47:32 SUCCESSFUL.

20:47:33 IT HAS STREETS THAT WERE PLANNED 

20:47:36 TO BE FOUR LANE WIDE BUT THAT WE 

20:47:39 HAVE KEPT AT TWO LANES FOR 

20:47:42 SAFETY AND MULTIMODAL BENEFITS.

20:47:45 BUT WE ALSO DO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT 

20:47:47 SOME STREETS HAVE SOME UNIQUE 

20:47:48 SITUATIONS.

20:47:49 AND I THINK THIS IS ONE THAT 

20:47:52 DOES HAVE A UNIQUE SITUATION IN 

20:47:54 BEING CLOSE TO A FLEE WAY 

20:47:57  FREEWAY 

20:47:58 INTERCHANGE AND THAT HAS BEEN 

20:48:00 THE SOURCE OF CONCERN IN THE 

20:48:02 PAST ABOUT THIS AS SOMEWHAT OF A 

20:48:04 GATEWAY STREET CORRIDOR.

20:48:06 WE DO THOUGH FEEL THAT THE 

20:48:08 TRAFFIC VOLUMES NOW AND INTO THE 

20:48:09 FUTURE ARE KIND OF WELL WITHIN 

20:48:11 WHAT WE CAN MANAGE AND THEN 

20:48:14 NOTABLY WE ARE NOT PROPOSING TO 

20:48:16 CHANGE ANY OF THE CAPACITY OF 

20:48:18 THE MAJOR SIGNALIZED 

20:48:20 INTERSECTIONS WHICH ESSENTIALLY 

20:48:22 CONTROL THE CAPACITY OF TRAFFIC 

20:48:22 FLOW.

20:48:24 I MIGHT NOTE JUST THE STREET AT 

20:48:26 THE BOTTOM IS A ROAD DIET THAT 

20:48:29 THE CITY COUNCIL AND STAFF DID 

20:48:32 CONSIDER FAIRLY RECENTLY.

20:48:34 IT'S KIND OF AT THE HIGHER END 

20:48:36 OF THE STREETS WITH 24,000 AND 

20:48:38 ONE OF THE KEY SPECIAL 

20:48:41 CONDITIONS THERE WAS THE VERY 

20:48:44 FREQUENT RICK TRAIN CROSSINGINGS 

20:48:45 OF THE CORRIDOR REALLY CREATED 

20:48:47 IMPACTS FOR TRAFFIC FLOW 

20:48:49 PARTICULARLY OPERATING LESS THAN 

20:48:52 FOUR LANE CONDITION.

20:48:55 AND SO WE -- STAFF RECOMMENDED 

20:48:56 AND COUNCIL APPROVED KEEPING 

20:48:59 THAT ROADWAY AT FOUR LANES.

20:49:03 SO IT'S NOT, YOU KNOW, ONE SIZE 

20:49:04 FITS ALL.

20:49:05 THERE'S SORT OF A LOT OF 

20:49:06 DIFFERENT FACTORS THAT GO INTO 

20:49:07 THIS.

20:49:09 I THINK WHAT IS KIND OF UNIQUE 

20:49:11 ABOUT THIS OUTREACH PROCESS THAT 

20:49:13 WE'RE DOING NOW, PREVIOUSLY WE 

20:49:16 HAD CONSIDERED THIS AS JUST A 

20:49:17 ROAD DIET PROJECT.

20:49:19 AND THEN WE WOULD SEPARATELY 

20:49:21 CONSIDER OTHER TRAFFIC SAFETY 

20:49:24 MEASURES LIKE TRAFFIC SIGNAL, 

20:49:31 FLASHING BEACONS, SPEED FEEDBACK 

20:49:33 SIGNS THAT WE HAVE DEPLOYED IN 

20:49:34 OTHER PARTS OF THE CITY.

20:49:35 WE ARE THOUSAND CONSIDERING THIS 

20:49:37 AS PART OF A COMPLETE, COMPLETE 

20:49:38 STREET PROJECT WHERE WE'RE 

20:49:40 LOOKING AT PACKAGING TOGETHER A 

20:49:42 VARIETY OF DIFFERENT SAFETY 

20:49:43 IMPROVEMENTS.

20:49:44 AND WE HAVE SURVEYED THE 

20:49:46 COMMUNITY IN TERMS OF KIND OF 

20:49:49 THEIR INTEREST OR CONCERNS ABOUT 

20:49:51 THESE VARIOUS MEASURES.

20:49:54 SO WE'RE NOT CONSIDERING A ROAD 

20:49:54 DIET AT THIS TIME.

20:49:58 SO AS COUNCIL KNOWS, WE DID A 

20:50:00 COMMUNITY OUTREACH SURVEY ON 

20:50:03 THIS TO GET PEOPLE'S INPUT IN 

20:50:06 TERMS OF IDEAS AND ISSUES 

20:50:08 REGARDING STREET DESIGN.

20:50:16 WE HAVE AGO REGATED THIS FOR 

20:50:17 FEEDBACK FROM PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN 

20:50:19 THE CORRIDOR, LIVE IN THE 

20:50:20 NEIGHBORHOOD OR THOSE WHO ARE 

20:50:21 JUST PASSING THROUGH.

20:50:22 SO YOU CAN SEE THE NUMBERS 

20:50:22 THERE.

20:50:23 MOST OF THE PEOPLE THAT 

20:50:25 RESPONDED ARE GENERALLY FOLKS 

20:50:26 THAT ARE DRIVING AND PASSING 

20:50:29 THROUGH CORRIDOR.

20:50:31 THE MAIN THING THAT WE'VE HEARD 

20:50:35 IS THAT MOST OF THE FOLKS ARE 

20:50:36 CONCERNED ABOUT TRAFFIC 

20:50:38 CONGESTION.

20:50:39 PARTICULARLY WITH THE 

20:50:42 CONSIDERATION THE ROAD DIET.

20:50:43 LOCAL RESIDENTS ARE PARTICULARLY 

20:50:45 CONCERNED WITH THE LEVEL OF 

20:50:45 SPEEDING THAT'S OCCURRING HERE.

20:50:50 WHEN WE SURVEYED FOLKS IN TERMS 

20:50:52 OF THE TYPES OF TRAFFIC 

20:50:53 IMPROVEMENTS THAT THEY SUPPORT 

20:50:55 WE GOT A HIGH DEGREE OF SUPPORT 

20:50:59 FOR COORDINATING TRAFFIC SIGNALS 

20:51:01 INSTALLING MORE FLASHING 

20:51:03 BEACONS, USING SPEED FEEDBACK 

20:51:05 DESIGNS AND EVEN ADDING A NEW 

20:51:07 TRAFFIC SIGNAL TO THE CORRIDOR.

20:51:08 THE ONE ELEMENT THAT CONTINUES 

20:51:12 TO HAVE CONTROVERSY AND A MIXED 

20:51:14 VIEW IS A CONSIDERATION OF 

20:51:15 REDUCING IT FROM FOUR LANES TO 

20:51:17 TWO, THE ROAD DIET.

20:51:18 SO EVEN FOR FOLKS THAT 

20:51:20 PARTICIPATED IN THE SURVEY THAT 

20:51:22 LIVE IN THE CORRIDOR, THEIR VIEW 

20:51:25 IS LIKE 50-50 OVER THE ROAD 

20:51:25 DIET.

20:51:27 BUT CLEARLY, EVERYONE ELSE WHO 

20:51:30 RESPONDED TO IT, THERE WAS A 

20:51:31 VERY STRONG LEVEL OF CONCERN 

20:51:36 ABOUT THE ROAD DIET, PRIMARILY 

20:51:38 ASSOCIATED WITH CONCERNS ABOUT 

20:51:39 TRAFFIC CONGESTION THAT THAT 

20:51:42 MIGHT CREATE.

20:51:44 SO AS WE'VE LOOKED TO PROCESS 

20:51:47 THIS, AND AS WE PROVIDE THE 

20:51:48 COUNCIL WITH OUR RECOMMENDATION, 

20:51:51 WE LOOK AT IT THROUGH THE LENS 

20:51:53 OF ALIGNING WITH THE CITY'S 

20:51:54 TRANSPORTATION GOALS AND 

20:51:55 PRIORITIES.

20:51:59 WE LOOK AT IT IN TERMS OF FROM A 

20:52:02 DATA PERSPECTIVE, WE DEFINITELY 

20:52:03 CONSIDER THE INPUT AND IDEAS 

20:52:05 FROM THE COMMUNITY, AND WE MIX 

20:52:06 ALL THOSE TOGETHER TO PROVIDE 

20:52:09 YOU WITH WHAT WE THINK IS OUR 

20:52:10 BEST PROFESSIONAL JUDGMENT ON 

20:52:11 THE TOPIC.

20:52:14 AND SO WHAT WE ARE RECOMMENDING 

20:52:16 INCLUDES, I'LL START WITH THE 

20:52:19 GREEN ITEMS, THESE ARE ADDING A 

20:52:22 NEW TRAFFIC SIGNAL AT COVINGTON, 

20:52:25 AND FLASHING BEACONS AT A COUPLE 

20:52:26 OF OTHER LOCATIONS AT THE 

20:52:30 CORRIDOR AT DORN PLACE AND AT 

20:52:33 EITHER MENTO OR OLIVE.

20:52:35 AND THE REASON WE'RE CHOOSING 

20:52:38 THE TRAFFIC SNAM AT COVINGTON IS 

20:52:39 THAT IS THE AREA WITH THE 

20:52:41 HIGHEST CONCENTRATION OF TRAFFIC 

20:52:41 CRASHES.

20:52:42 IT IS AT THE CURVE.

20:52:45 IT'S WHERE MOST OF THE MAJOR 

20:52:47 CRASHES HAVE HAPPENED.

20:52:50 AND WE FEEL BY ADDING A TRAFFIC 

20:52:52 SIGNAL THERE WILL HELP BREAK UP 

20:52:54 THE FLOW OF TRAFFIC AND 

20:52:56 CERTAINLY SERVE TO SLOW DOWN 

20:52:57 PEOPLE AND CREATE A SAFER 

20:52:59 CROSSING LOCATION AT THAT 

20:53:01 IMPORTANT LOCATION.

20:53:03 WE'RE ALSO RECOMMENDING SHOWN IN 

20:53:05 THE YELLOW-ORANGE COLOR, 

20:53:08 MODERNIZING THE TRAFFIC SIGNALS 

20:53:09 AT THE KEY MAJOR INTERSECTIONS 

20:53:12 OF THE AREA, AT DRISCOLL AND 

20:53:15 PASEO PADRE PARKWAY TO THE UPPER 

20:53:17 LEFT, WASHINGTON BOULEVARD AND 

20:53:19 PASEO PADRE TO THE BOTTOM RIGHT, 

20:53:23 AGAIN, WE WOULD NOT CHANGE ANY 

20:53:26 OF THE LAIN CONFIGURATIONS AT 

20:53:26 THOSE INTERSECTIONS.

20:53:28 WE WOULD UPGRADE THE TECHNOLOGY 

20:53:29 FOR IMPROVED TRAFFIC FLOW.

20:53:31 AND THEN THE LAST RECOMMENDATION 

20:53:34 WHICH IS REALLY THE 

20:53:35 CONTROVERSIAL PIECE IS THE ROAD 

20:53:36 DIET.

20:53:38 WE STILL BELIEVE THAT THIS IS IN 

20:53:40 THE BEST INTEREST OF COMPLETE 

20:53:42 STREETS AND TRAFFIC FLOW, AND WE 

20:53:44 CAN MAKE THIS WORK WITH THE 

20:53:46 VOLUMES.

20:53:48 SO WE ARE IN THAT AREA AND IT 

20:53:50 DOESN'T GO RIGHT UP TO THE 

20:53:51 INTERSECTIONS, IT FALLS SHORT OF 

20:53:52 THAT.

20:53:54 SO IT'S ESSENTIALLY THE AREA IN 

20:53:57 BETWEEN PASEO PADRE PARKWAY WE 

20:53:58 WOULD REDUCE THE FOUR LANES DOWN 

20:54:00 TO TWO AND THAT WOULD NEABILITY 

20:54:03  ENABLE US 

20:54:05 TO ADD BUFFERED BIKE LANES TO 

20:54:06 THE CORRIDOR.

20:54:08 AND SO THIS IS MY LAST SLIDE AND 

20:54:10 I JUST WANTED TO KIND OF SORT OF 

20:54:12 HIGHLIGHT FOR COUNCIL, WE THINK, 

20:54:14 THAT YOU KNOW THERE ARE TWO 

20:54:17 OPTIONS THAT WE'D LIKE TO SORT 

20:54:19 OF OFFER TO FACILITATE THE 

20:54:21 POLICY DIRECTION ON THIS.

20:54:23 SO OPTION OF 1 IS WHAT I'VE 

20:54:25 DESCRIBED AS OUR STAFF 

20:54:27 RECOMMENDATION, IN A WAY IT'S, 

20:54:29 IN ALL OF THE ABOVE.

20:54:33 NEW SIGNAL, FLASHING BEACONS.

20:54:35 MODERNIZE THE TRAFFIC SIGNAL AND 

20:54:36 THE ROAD DIET.

20:54:38 AND SO THOSE ARE THE FOURS 

20:54:39 ELEMENTS.

20:54:43 OPTION 2 IS BASICALLY MOST OF 

20:54:44 THE PACKAGE.

20:54:45 SO IT'S -- AND THESE ARE ITEMS 

20:54:49 THAT OUR COMMUNITY FEEDBACK 

20:54:51 SURVEY HAD INDICATED THAT THERE 

20:54:52 IS COMMUNITY SUPPORT FOR.

20:54:55 AND THAT INCLUDES THE SIGNAL, 

20:54:57 FLASHING BEACONS AND MODERNIZING 

20:54:58 THE TRAFFIC SIGNALS.

20:55:00 AND THEN THE OPTION UNDER THIS 

20:55:02 WOULD BE TO NOT CONSIDER THE 

20:55:04 ROAD DIET DUE TO THE CONCERNS 

20:55:06 THAT HAVE BEEN EXPRESSED BY THE 

20:55:10 COMMUNITY.

20:55:12 I THINK IN CONCLUSION, I THINK 

20:55:13 WHATEVER WE DO BETWEEN THESE TWO 

20:55:15 OPTIONS WE WILL BE SIGNIFICANTLY 

20:55:17 ADVANCING TRAFFIC SAFETY IN THIS 

20:55:22 CORRIDOR AND SO I THINK 

20:55:23 COLLECTIVELY AS AN ORGANIZATION, 

20:55:26 WE CAN ALL FEEL PROUD OF REALLY 

20:55:27 THIS SUBSTANTIAL SAFETY 

20:55:29 IMPROVEMENTS THAT WE'VE DONE 

20:55:31 SINCE WE'VE ADOPTED A VISION 

20:55:32 ZERO POLICY.

20:55:34 AND THAT ANY DIRECTION WE TAKE 

20:55:36 BETWEEN THESE TWO OPTIONS WOULD 

20:55:37 CONTINUE OUR POSITIVE DIRECTION 

20:55:40 IN MAKING FREMONT A SAFER PLACE 

20:55:42 TO TRAVEL FOR EVERYONE.

20:55:45 SO THAT CONCLUDES MY REMARKS.

20:55:47 AND I'D BE HAPPY TO ADDRESS ANY 

20:55:49 QUESTIONS THAT COUNCIL HAS AND 

20:55:50 SO THANK YOU.

20:55:56 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

20:55:57 WE'LL BEGIN WITH CLARIFYING 

20:55:59 QUESTIONS FROM THE COUNCIL.

20:56:02 CLARIFYING QUESTIONS FROM 

20:56:03 COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN.

20:56:04 >> Councilmember Kassan:   I 

20:56:08 JUST WANTED TO CONFIRM.

20:56:10 I'LL TELL YOU THAT BELIEVE IT OR 

20:56:14 NOT, MY FATHER IS THE OLDEST 

20:56:16 PRACTICING TRAFFIC ENGINEER IN 

20:56:19 THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

20:56:19 [ Laughter ]

20:56:22 AND I SHOWED THEM TO HIM, YEAH, 

20:56:24 AND I SHOWED THIS TO HIM AND HE 

20:56:27 ASKED ME, ARE THERE LEFT TURN 

20:56:30 POCKETS IN THE CENTER MEDIAN?

20:56:31 BECAUSE THAT WOULD OBVIOUSLY 

20:56:34 HELP QUITE A BIT IN PREVENTING 

20:56:35 BACKUP.

20:56:39 SO CAN YOU SPEAK TO WHETHER 

20:56:40 THERE ARE LEFT TURN POCKETS AT 

20:56:43 THE INTERSECTIONS?

20:56:44 >> Hans Larsen:   YES, YES, 

20:56:46 THERE ARE LEFT TURN POCKETS AT 

20:56:48 THE INTERSECTIONS.

20:56:56 AND FOR EXAMPLE, AT PAST YOA AND 

20:57:01  PASEO AND 

20:57:01 WASHINGTON.

20:57:04 A LONG LEFT TURN POCKET THAT 

20:57:06 LEADS TO THE INTERCHANGE AT 680 

20:57:07 AND WASHINGTON.

20:57:08 THOSE WOULDN'T BE ENACTED.

20:57:11 ALONG THE LONG CORRIDOR PASEO 

20:57:14 PADRE PARKWAY HAS A RAISED 

20:57:14 MEDIAN ISLAND.

20:57:17 SO THERE ARE OPENINGS FOR LEFT 

20:57:18 TURN ACCESS FROM SOME OF THE 

20:57:19 MAJOR SIDE STREETS.

20:57:21 NONE OF THOSE WOULD BE AFFECTED 

20:57:23 WITH THE PROPOSAL TO DO A ROAD 

20:57:25 DIET.

20:57:25 >> Councilmember Kassan:   OKAY.

20:57:27 AND THE RIGHT TURNS I KNOW SOME 

20:57:28 PEOPLE GET FRUSTRATED SOMETIMES 

20:57:31 WHEN THEY CAN'T MAKE A RIGHT 

20:57:31 TURN.

20:57:33 BUT IN THIS CASE, THEY WOULD BE 

20:57:36 ABLE TO DRIVE INTO THE -- DRIVE 

20:57:39 ACROSS THE BIKE LANE AND MAKE A 

20:57:40 RIGHT TURN WITHOUT HAVING TO 

20:57:44 WAIT FOR THE LIGHT TO CHANGE OR 

20:57:46 THE TRAFFIC TO MOVE ON?

20:57:47 >> Hans Larsen:   YES, THAT'S 

20:57:47 CORRECT.

20:57:50 AGAIN THE INTERSECTIONS OF BOTH 

20:57:51 DRISCOLL AND AT WASHINGTON 

20:57:53 WOULDN'T BE CHANGED FROM THE WAY 

20:57:55 THEY ARE TODAY.

20:57:59 >> Councilmember Kassan:   OKAY 

20:58:01 THANK YOU.

20:58:02 >> Mayor Mei:   COUNCILMEMBER 

20:58:04 SHAO CLARIFYING QUESTIONS.

20:58:05 >> Councilmember Shao:   THANK 

20:58:06 YOU, MADAM MAYOR.

20:58:08 TODAY SEEMS TO FOCUS ON THE 

20:58:08 SPEED.

20:58:11 SO IN RECENT YEARS, HAS THE 

20:58:15 SPEED LIMIT ON THIS PART OF 

20:58:18 PASEO PADRE CORRIDOR BEEN 

20:58:22 CHANGED FROM LET'S SAY 40 TO 35 

20:58:29 AS THE CURRENT SPEED LIMIT?

20:58:30 >> Hans Larsen:   I DON'T 

20:58:31 BELIEVE SO, THAT THERE'S BEEN 

20:58:34 ANY CHANGES SINCE 2015.

20:58:38 I THINK I RECALL HEARING FROM 

20:58:39 COUNCILMEMBER JONES THAT THERE 

20:58:41 MAY HAVE BEEN SOME TIME PRIOR TO 

20:58:42 THAT WHERE IT WAS ACTUALLY 

20:58:45 INCREASED FROM 30 TO 35.

20:58:47 THE WAY THAT SPEED LIMITS ARE 

20:58:50 SET IN CALIFORNIA ARE -- 

20:58:51 ACTUALLY THERE'S BEEN 

20:58:53 LEGISLATION THAT PROVIDES SOME 

20:58:55 MORE FLEXIBILITY, IS THAT SPEED 

20:58:57 LIMITS ARE GENERALLY SET BASED 

20:58:59 ON THE PREVAILING SPEED OF 

20:59:00 TRAFFIC.

20:59:02 AND IF WE WERE UNDER THE OLD 

20:59:05 RULES WE WOULD ESSENTIALLY NEED 

20:59:07 TO RAISE THE SPEED LIMIT TO 45 

20:59:09 MILES AN HOUR, GIVEN THAT THAT'S 

20:59:10 THE PREVAILING SPEED OF THE 

20:59:14 CORRIDOR.

20:59:16 SO BUT NO, IN THE RECENT PAST 

20:59:17 THERE'S NOT BEEN ANY CHANGES TO 

20:59:18 THE SPEED LIMIT.

20:59:21 >> Councilmember Shao:   THANK 

20:59:21 YOU.

20:59:23 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

20:59:24 CLARIFYING QUESTIONS?

20:59:29 VICE MAYOR SALWAN.

20:59:30 >> Councilmember Salwan:   THANK 

20:59:31 YOU, MADAM MAYOR AND THANK YOU 

20:59:32 MR. LARSON.

20:59:36 SO THIS PART OF PASEO IS VERY -- 

20:59:37 I DON'T KNOW WHO CREATED THIS 

20:59:40 STREET BUT IT'S VERY TERRIBLY 

20:59:42 DESIGNED AS FAR AS IT'S LIKE A 

20:59:44 SNAKE CURVING THROUGH DIFFERENT 

20:59:44 PARTS OF THE CITY.

20:59:47 AND THE OTHER THING THAT IS KIND 

20:59:52 OF ATYPICAL FOR PASEO IS THE 

20:59:54 PARKING.

20:59:57 IS THIS PART OF PA SAI OWE 

20:59:59 HAVING SPOTS WHILE THE REST OF 

21:00:01 IT HAS NOT?

21:00:03 >> Hans Larsen:   WHY THIS PIECE 

21:00:04 HAS ONSTREET PARKING?

21:00:14 I THINK IT'S PRIMARILY, ONSTREET 

21:00:16 PARKING IS TYPICALLY PROVIDED.

21:00:19 A LOT OF THE ARTERIAL STREETS IN 

21:00:20 FREMONT DON'T HAVE PARKING ON 

21:00:22 THEM BUT GENERALLY THE 

21:00:25 DEVELOPMENT IS EITHER HAS LIKE A 

21:00:28 FRONTAGE ROAD SUCH AS AN EXAMPLE 

21:00:30 ON STEVENSON OR PARTS OF MOWRY 

21:00:34 OR THAT THERE IS -- THERE ARE 

21:00:36 COMMERCIAL DISTRICTS OR THAT THE 

21:00:37 RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT BACKS UP 

21:00:38 TO THE CORRIDOR AND SO THERE'S 

21:00:40 NOT A NEED FOR THE FRONT-ON 

21:00:41 ACCESS.

21:00:44 SO THERE IS A KIND OF A UNIQUE 

21:00:46 ELEMENT TO YEAH, THE DESIGN OF 

21:00:48 THIS BOTH FROM A LAND USE AND 

21:00:51 THE LAYOUT OF THE ROAD WHICH 

21:00:53 DOES ENCOURAGE THE HIGH 

21:00:53 SPEEDING.

21:00:58 >> Councilmember Salwan:   OKAY.

21:01:00 IT SOUNDED LIKE MOST OF THE 

21:01:01 RESIDENTS DID NOT WANT TO CHANGE 

21:01:02 THE PARKING.

21:01:04 HAS THAT BEEN PART OF THE SURVEY 

21:01:06 OR HAVE WE SPECIFICALLY ASKED 

21:01:07 THE FOLKS ON EACH OF THE 

21:01:16 DIFFERENT HOUSES ON PASEO?

21:01:17 >> Hans Larsen:   YES, THAT WAS 

21:01:19 ONE OF THE QUESTIONS ON THE 

21:01:20 WRITTEN STAFF REPORT, WE 

21:01:21 REFLECTED THAT FOR THE RESIDENTS 

21:01:24 THAT LIVE ON PASEO PADRE PARKWAY 

21:01:26 THE OPTION TO REMOVE ONSTREET 

21:01:29 PARKING WAS VERY UNPOPULAR AND 

21:01:31 WE GOT A 75% OPPOSITION TO 

21:01:32 CONSIDERING THAT.

21:01:34 >> Councilmember Salwan:   AND 

21:01:36 THEN THE LAST QUESTION WAS, I 

21:01:37 DON'T RECALL, ARE THERE ANY 

21:01:39 RADAR SPEED SIGNS ON THIS 

21:01:44 CORRIDOR?

21:01:45 >> Hans Larsen:   YES, WE DO 

21:01:46 HAVE, WE PLACED THIS IN THIS 

21:01:49 CORRIDOR A WHILE BACK SO YES, 

21:01:50 THERE ARE SOME THERE NOW.

21:01:51 >> Councilmember Salwan:   OKAY.

21:01:56 THANK YOU, THAT'S IT FOR NOW.

21:01:57 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU, 

21:01:58 CLARIFYING QUESTIONS.

21:02:00 COUNCILMEMBER JONES.

21:02:00 >> Councilmember Jones:   THANK 

21:02:03 YOU, MADAM MAYOR AND THANK YOU, 

21:02:03 MR. LARSON.

21:02:05 JUST A COUPLE OF QUICK 

21:02:05 QUESTIONS.

21:02:07 NUMBER 1 TO ADDRESS THE COMMENT 

21:02:09 YOU MADE EARLIER YES, THE SPEED 

21:02:10 LIMIT WAS 30 MILES PER HOUR.

21:02:12 AND I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHEN IT 

21:02:14 WAS RAISED TO 35.

21:02:17 BUT WOULD YOU SAY WITH ALL OF 

21:02:19 THE -- AND COMMENTS COMING FROM 

21:02:21 EVERYWHERE, REGARDING THE COVID 

21:02:23 SPEEDERS FOR LACK OF A BETTER 

21:02:24 TERM, IT'S HAPPENING ON OUR 

21:02:26 FREEWAYS, IT'S HAPPENING ON OUR 

21:02:28 CITY STREETS, IT'S HAPPENING 

21:02:29 PRETTY MUCH EVERYWHERE.

21:02:32 IF WE STILL HAD TO FOLLOW THE 

21:02:34 85TH PERCENTILE RULE WE WOULD 

21:02:36 PROBABLY BE RAISING SPEED LIMITS 

21:02:37 ON A NUMBER OF THE STREETS IN 

21:02:39 OUR CITY IS THAT CORRECT?

21:02:39 >> Hans Larsen:   THAT IS 

21:02:40 CORRECT.

21:02:41 AND CERTAINLY THAT WOULD BE THE 

21:02:44 CASE HERE.

21:02:48 THERE WAS STATE LEGISLATIVE 

21:02:50 CHANGE LAST YEAR THAT PROVIDES 

21:02:52 CITIES MORE FLEXIBILITY ON 

21:02:57 SETTING SPEED LIMITS.

21:02:59 WE HAVE AS PART OF OUR VISION 

21:03:00 ZERO PROGRAM AS COUNCIL MAY BE 

21:03:02 AWARE THAT WITH THE CHANGES THAT 

21:03:04 WE'VE MADE TO OUR STREETS, 

21:03:07 PARTICULARLY FEEDBACK SIGNS, 

21:03:10 NARROWING LANES, THAT WE'VE BEEN 

21:03:12 ABLE TO ACTUALLY REDUCE SPEED 

21:03:15 LIMITS BECAUSE WE'VE CHANGED THE 

21:03:16 OPERATING CHARACTERISTIC OF THE 

21:03:17 ROADWAY.

21:03:19 AND SO THERE'S ACTUALLY BEEN 50 

21:03:21 LOCATIONS OVER THE LAST SEVERAL 

21:03:24 YEARS WHERE WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO 

21:03:27 LOWER SPEED LIMITS BY FIVE MILES 

21:03:29 AN HOUR PARTLY DUE TO THE 

21:03:31 CHANGES IN THE ROADWAY DESIGN 

21:03:33 WHICH HAS ENCOURAGED PEOPLE TO 

21:03:36 NATURALLY TRAVEL SLOWER.

21:03:38 THE RECENT DYNAMIC LITERALLY IN 

21:03:40 THE LAST ONE OR TWO YEARS SORT 

21:03:43 OF THE COVID-CRAZY SPEEDING 

21:03:46 PHENOMENON THAT IS OCCURRED, YOU 

21:03:49 KNOW THAT HAS BEEN -- THAT HAS 

21:03:52 BEEN A PROBLEM IN FREMONT AS 

21:03:53 WELL AS ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

21:03:57 I MEAN, THE FATALITY RATES LAST 

21:03:59 YEAR WERE THE HIGHEST THAT 

21:04:01 THEY'VE BEEN FOR OVER A DECADE.

21:04:03 AND A LOT OF IT IS ASSOCIATED 

21:04:06 WITH REALLY RECKLESS EXCESSIVE 

21:04:07 SPEEDING.

21:04:08 >> Councilmember Jones:   OKAY.

21:04:12 SO GIVEN THE LEGISLATION THAT WE 

21:04:13 HAVE MORE FLEXIBILITY TO REDUCE 

21:04:16 SPEED LIMITS IN THE EVENT THAT 

21:04:17 SOME CHANGES, WOULD THE ADDITION 

21:04:20 OF THE BICYCLE LANE THAT IS 

21:04:22 THERE CURRENTLY JUSTIFY A 

21:04:23 REDUCTION IN THE SPEED ON THAT 

21:04:28 STREET?

21:04:29 >> Hans Larsen:   SO WHAT WE DID 

21:04:32 AS PART OF OUR DATA COLLECTION, 

21:04:34 SINCE WE PUT IN PLACE THE SNARE 

21:04:36 OWER TRAVEL LANES AND ADDING THE 

21:04:39 BIKE LANE, SO THAT THE DATA THAT 

21:04:41 IS REPORTED IN OUR STAFF REPORT, 

21:04:44 AND I INCLUDED ON A SLIDE, WHERE 

21:04:46 16% OF THE PEOPLE ARE GOING 45 

21:04:49 MILES AN HOUR OR HIGHER, THAT IS 

21:04:51 IN THE CONDITION THAT'S THERE 

21:04:53 TODAY WITH THE BIKE LANE AND THE 

21:04:54 NARROWER LANES.

21:04:56 AND SO I THINK OUR CONCLUSION IS 

21:05:00 THAT THE ADJUSTMENTS THAT WE 

21:05:04 MADE CERTAINLY HAVEN'T AFFECTED 

21:05:05 THE LEVEL OF SPEEDING IN THE 

21:05:07 CORRIDOR THAT CERTAINLY WE HAD 

21:05:08 HOPED OR WOULD LIKE TO SEE.

21:05:11 AND SO WE THINK THAT PROMPTS OUR 

21:05:13 RECOMMENDATION TO NEED TO TAKE 

21:05:16 SOME MORE SIGNIFICANT ACTION TO 

21:05:18 MANAGE SPEEDING AND JUST MANAGE 

21:05:21 THE OVERALL SAFETY WITHIN THE 

21:05:22 CORRIDOR.

21:05:23 >> Councilmember Jones:   OKAY.

21:05:26 AND THEN REGARDING THE 

21:05:28 CONGESTION, AS IT RELATES TO 

21:05:31 THIS SUNOL GRADE WIDENING 

21:05:33 PROJECT, HOW LONG WAS THAT 

21:05:35 PROJECTS AVAILABLE OR HOW LONG 

21:05:36 WAS THAT EXPRESS LANE AVAILABLE 

21:05:39 IF YOU WILL, PRIOR TO THE COVID 

21:05:40 SHUTDOWN?

21:05:45 >> Hans Larsen:   SO THE 

21:05:46 PROJECTS OPENED UP DURING COVID.

21:05:49 SO I BELIEVE IT WAS OCTOBER 2020 

21:05:50 WHEN THE SUNOL GRADE LANE WAS 

21:05:51 OPENED.

21:05:54 AND SO WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEE 

21:05:57 BOTH -- THERE'S BEEN A 

21:05:58 SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN OVERALL 

21:06:01 TRAFFIC ON PASEO PADRE PARKWAY 

21:06:04 DUE TO BOTH TRAFFIC CHANGES DUE 

21:06:06 TO THE PANDEMIC, BUT ALSO 

21:06:08 ASSOCIATED WITH THE BENEFITS OF 

21:06:11 THE ADDITIONAL LANE ON 680.

21:06:12 KIND OF THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE 

21:06:17 ADDED LANE IS THAT BECAUSE OF 

21:06:20 THE BOTTLENECK IN THE CONGESTION 

21:06:23 ON 680 AND WHERE IT WAS LOCATED 

21:06:25 IN FREMONT WAS ESSENTIALLY 

21:06:28 ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO TAKE LOCAL 

21:06:32 ROADS SUCH AS MISSION BOULEVARD, 

21:06:34 PASEO PADRE.

21:06:44  PARKWAY TO BYPASS 

21:06:46 THE CONSTRUCTION ON THE STREETS.

21:06:47 SOMETHING THAT WE CAN EXPECT TO 

21:06:50 HAVE SOME PERMANENT BENEFITS FOR 

21:06:52 OUR COMMUNITY WHICH WE'RE VERY 

21:06:53 HAPPY FOR.

21:06:54 >> Councilmember Jones:   OKAY 

21:06:55 BUT WE'RE NOT REALLY GOING TO 

21:06:57 KNOW THE FULL EFFECT OF THE 

21:07:00 WIDENING OF SUNOL GRADE UNTIL 

21:07:03 EVERYTHING RECOVERS FROM THE 

21:07:05 PANDEMIC IS THAT CORRECT?

21:07:05 >> Hans Larsen:   THAT'S 

21:07:05 CORRECT.

21:07:07 AND I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE 

21:07:08 CHALLENGES OF THIS PARTICULAR 

21:07:09 ISSUE.

21:07:11 THAT WE ARE IN AN AREA OF 

21:07:12 FLUCTUATING TRAFFIC VOLUMES AND 

21:07:15 WE'RE NOT EXACTLY SURE WHAT THE 

21:07:18 FUTURE IS GOING TO BRING.

21:07:20 BUT I THINK THE NUMBERS THAT WE 

21:07:22 DID -- THAT WE'VE BEEN REPORTING 

21:07:24 IN TERMS OF THE RANGE, ROUGHLY, 

21:07:29 FROM I THINK IT WAS 8900 TO 

21:07:32 13,500, REPRESENTS THE CURRENT 

21:07:32 VOLUMES.

21:07:36 AND THEN THE PEAK VOLUME THAT 

21:07:40 WAS IN THIS CORRIDOR PRE-COVID, 

21:07:42 PRE-680 WIDENING.

21:07:43 SO WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE 

21:07:45 NUMBERS ARE GOING TO GO, REACH 

21:07:47 THAT POINT OR GO SIGNIFICANTLY 

21:07:49 HIGHER TO THE POINT WHERE, YOU 

21:07:50 KNOW, WE WOULD BE FACING 

21:07:56 CHALLENGES OF PACHED PARKWAY AS 

21:08:01 A TWO-LANE HIGHWAY COULD HAVE 

21:08:02 EXPECTED HIGHER TRAFFIC VOLUMES 

21:08:04 AND STILL WELL WITHIN THE RANGE 

21:08:06 OF WHAT A TWO LANE STREET CAN 

21:08:07 CARRY.

21:08:08 >> Councilmember Jones:   OKAY.

21:08:10 TURNING TO THE SURVEY REAL 

21:08:14 QUICK, THERE WERE 800 RESPONSES, 

21:08:17 AND IF I RECALL, 50% OF THE 

21:08:19 RESPONDENTS LIVING ON PASEO 

21:08:23 PADRE SUPPORT A REDUCTION WHILE 

21:08:26 75% ARE OPPOSED?

21:08:27 IS THAT CORRECT?

21:08:28 >> Hans Larsen:   SO YEAH, I 

21:08:30 THINK FOR FOLKS THAT RESPONDED 

21:08:32 TO THE SURVEY, THEY WERE ON 

21:08:35 PASEO PADRE PARKWAY THEY WERE 

21:08:38 50-50 ON THE ROAD DIET.

21:08:40 WHICH, YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT WAS A 

21:08:41 LITTLE BIT SURPRISING.

21:08:42 I WOULD THINK THAT, YOU KNOW, 

21:08:44 THERE WOULD BE MORE SUPPORT FROM 

21:08:47 FOLKS THAT ARE ON THE CORRIDOR 

21:08:48 DIRECTLY.

21:08:53 BUT THEN FOLKS THAT ARE BEYOND 

21:08:55 EVERYBODY ELSE OUTSIDE THE FOLKS 

21:08:59 LIVING IN THE CORRIDOR, THE 

21:09:01 OPPOSITION TO THE ROAD DIET WAS 

21:09:01 75%.

21:09:07 SO -- AND THAT WAS MOST OF THE 

21:09:08 PEOPLE THAT RESPONDED TO THE 

21:09:10 SURVEY AND THAT'S A VERY 

21:09:11 SIGNIFICANT LEVEL OF CONCERN 

21:09:13 THAT WE HEARD.

21:09:13 >> Councilmember Jones:   KIND 

21:09:14 OF THE DISAPPOINTING THING ABOUT 

21:09:19 THE RESPONSE, YOU SAID ONLY 7% 

21:09:20 OF THE PEOPLE WHO RESPONDED 

21:09:23 ACTUALLY LIVE ON THAT STRETCH OF 

21:09:26 PASEO PADRE, AND IF ONLY 50% OF 

21:09:27 THOSE ARE IN AGREEMENT WITH THE 

21:09:29 ROAD DIET THAT IS ONLY THREE AND 

21:09:32 A HALF% OF THE OVERALL RESPONSE, 

21:09:33 IS THAT CORRECT?

21:09:34 >> Hans Larsen:   I MEAN OF THE 

21:09:36 PEOPLE THAT -- WELL, I THINK, 

21:09:39 YOU KNOW, THERE ARE FOLKS THAT 

21:09:41 DON'T LIVE IN THE -- YOU KNOW 

21:09:46 THERE ARE FOLKS THAT ARE 

21:09:47 SUPPORTING THE ROAD DIET, THERE 

21:09:49 ARE FOLKS THAT ARE OUTSIDE THE 

21:09:51 NEIGHBORHOOD THAT SUPPORT THE 

21:09:53 ROAD DIET BUT THOSE ARE LIKE 25% 

21:09:54 OF THE TOTALS.

21:09:57 SO THAT'S THE RESULTS THAT WE 

21:09:58 GOT FROM THE SURVEY.

21:09:59 >> Councilmember Jones:   OKAY.

21:10:01 AND THEN GOING BACK TO YOU 

21:10:05 HIGHLIGHTED FOUR CATEGORIES FOR 

21:10:09 VISION ZERO SAFE STREETS AND 

21:10:11 REDUCING THE NUMBER OF INJURY 

21:10:12 AND FATAL COLLISIONS AND THOSE 

21:10:14 KINDS OF THINGS.

21:10:15 BUT ONE OF THE THINGS WITH SAFE 

21:10:21 ROUTES TO SCHOOLS AND 

21:10:22 PROVIDING -- SO IS THE INTENT OF 

21:10:29 THIS TO PROVIDE BUYS CYCLISTS A 

21:10:31 METHOD TO RIDE TO SCHOOL ON 

21:10:32 PASEO PADRE ITSELF?

21:10:33 >> Hans Larsen:   I THINK FROM 

21:10:34 THE SCHOOL PERSPECTIVE THERE ARE 

21:10:36 SORT OF TWO ELEMENTS OF IT.

21:10:39 AND WHAT WE HEARD AS A CONCERN 

21:10:42 WHEN WE WERE JUST CONSIDERING 

21:10:43 THE ROAD DIET IS PEOPLE SAID, 

21:10:45 HEY THERE ARE OTHER SAFETY 

21:10:47 ISSUES IN THIS CORRIDOR THAT THE 

21:10:51 ROAD DIET PROPOSAL DOESN'T 

21:10:52 ADDRESS.

21:10:54 AND FOLKS ARE INTERESTED IN SAFE 

21:10:56 CROSSING OF THE CORRIDOR.

21:10:58 AND WHETHER IT'S ACCESS TO 

21:11:00 SCHOOL OR OTHER FOLKS IN THEIR 

21:11:02 NEIGHBORHOOD, THE ROAD DIET 

21:11:06 SHORTENS THE CROSSING DISTANCE.

21:11:10 BUT IT -- THERE WAS STILL 

21:11:11 CONCERNS ABOUT CROSSING.

21:11:13 AND SO THAT'S WHY WE'VE BROUGHT 

21:11:15 INTO THIS PROCESS TRAFFIC 

21:11:17 SIGNALS AND FLASHING BEACONS AS 

21:11:19 A WAY TO CROSS THE CORRIDOR.

21:11:21 AND THOSE ARE PARTICULARLY 

21:11:23 EFFECTIVE FOR FOLKS THAT ARE 

21:11:24 TRAVELING TO THE SCHOOLS THAT 

21:11:26 NEED TO CROSS THE CORRIDOR.

21:11:28 THE OTHER PIECE THOUGH IS, I 

21:11:29 MEAN SOME PEOPLE WOULD USE THE 

21:11:33 CORRIDOR TO GO ALONG PASEO PADRE 

21:11:34 PARKWAY TO GET TO THE STREET 

21:11:36 THAT'S CLOSE TO THEIR SCHOOL 

21:11:36 COO.

21:11:39 .

21:11:40 SO WE FEEL THAT FOR CHILDREN AND 

21:11:41 FAMILIES THAT LIVE IN THE 

21:11:42 NEIGHBORHOOD THAT WOULD LIKE TO 

21:11:45 WALK OR BIKE TO SCHOOL, HAVING 

21:11:48 BOTH A WIDER BUFFERED LANE ON 

21:11:52 PASEO PADRE PARKWAY IS HELPFUL 

21:11:54 AS WELL AS SAFER PLACES TO BE 

21:11:56 ABLE TO CROSS THE STREET.

21:11:58 BOTH OF THOSE THINGS SUPPORT THE 

21:12:00 SAFE ROUTES TO SCHOOL OBJECTIVE.

21:12:01 >> Councilmember Jones:   OKAY.

21:12:03 DO WE STILL HAVE AN ORDINANCE IN 

21:12:06 PLACE THAT, I MEAN AS A GENERAL 

21:12:08 RULE YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO RIDE 

21:12:10 YOUR BICYCLE ON THE SIDEWALK.

21:12:12 HOWEVER FOR YEARS WE'VE HAD AN 

21:12:14 ORDINANCE IN PLACE THAT ALLOWS 

21:12:16 RESIDENTS UP TO 16 YEARS OF AGE 

21:12:18 TO RIDE THEIR BICYCLES ON THE 

21:12:18 SIDEWALK.

21:12:20 IS THAT STILL IN EFFECT?

21:12:20 >> Hans Larsen:   THAT IS MY 

21:12:22 UNDERSTANDING, YES, THAT'S STILL 

21:12:23 IN EFFECT.

21:12:24 >> Councilmember Jones:   AND I 

21:12:26 THINK THE IDEA BEHIND THAT WAS 

21:12:29 THEY COULD RIDE UNTIL THEY WERE 

21:12:31 16 AT WHICH POINT THEY WOULD 

21:12:33 PROBABLY GET A DRIVER'S LICENSE 

21:12:35 AND BE DRIVING TO SCHOOL?

21:12:36 >> Hans Larsen:   I'M NOT SURE 

21:12:37 OF THE HISTORY HOW THAT WAS 

21:12:39 ESTABLISHED THOSE NUMBERS BUT 

21:12:45 THAT SEEMS LOGICAL.

21:12:45 >> Councilmember Jones:   ALL 

21:12:47 RIGHT THOSE ARE ALL MY QUESTIONS 

21:12:49 FOR NOW.

21:12:49 >> Mayor Mei:   CLARIFYING 

21:12:51 QUESTIONS, COUNCILMEMBER KENG.

21:12:52 >> Councilmember Keng:   THANK 

21:12:53 YOU MADAM MAYOR AND THANK YOU 

21:12:55 MR. LARSON FOR YOUR 

21:12:55 PRESENTATION.

21:12:57 I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS.

21:13:01 ONE IS ALSO WHETHER WE CAN 

21:13:03 REDUCE THE SPEED LIMIT FOR THIS 

21:13:06 SECTION OF THE PASEO PADRE, AND 

21:13:12 SECOND, DO YOU KNOW HOW WE 

21:13:14 APPROACH THE IMMEDIATE NEIGHBORS 

21:13:17 THAT LIVE ON PASEO PADRE ABOUT 

21:13:20 THE SURVEY AND HOW MANY 

21:13:23 HOUSEHOLDS ARE THE NEAR 

21:13:24 NEIGHBORS AND HOW MANY OF THEM 

21:13:27 RESPONDED TO THE SURVEY?

21:13:28 >> Hans Larsen:   LET'S SEE ON 

21:13:31 THE LAST PART I DON'T HAVE THE 

21:13:35 NUMBERS IMMEDIATELY HANDY.

21:13:36 I MIGHT BE ABLE TO GET THE 

21:13:38 ANSWER FROM MY STAFF AND GET 

21:13:40 BACK TO YOU MOMENTARILY.

21:13:43 REGARDING THE ABILITY TO REDUCE 

21:13:49 THE SPEED LIMIT, THERE -- 

21:13:51 THERE'S STILL IS IN PLACE UNDER 

21:13:53 STATE LAW A KIND OF REQUIREMENT 

21:13:56 TO CONSIDER THE PREVAILING 

21:13:57 SPEED.

21:13:58 THERE'S MORE FLEXIBILITY TO 

21:14:01 LOWER SPEED LIMITS IN 

21:14:03 NEIGHBORHOOD OR COMMERCIAL 

21:14:07 DISTRICT ENVIRONMENTS.

21:14:09 BUT UNDER THE CURRENT LAWS I 

21:14:10 DON'T THINK WE COULD MAKE A CASE 

21:14:13 TO LOWER IT BELOW 35 MILES AN 

21:14:14 HOUR AT THIS POINT WITH THE 

21:14:16 PREVAILING SPEEDS BEING WHAT 

21:14:17 THEY'RE AT.

21:14:19 WE WOULD NEED TO DO SOMETHING 

21:14:21 WITH THE ROADWAY THAT KIND OF 

21:14:24 SORT OF FORCED OR ENCOURAGED 

21:14:25 SOME CHANGES TO BE ABLE TO 

21:14:27 CONSIDER THAT.

21:14:31 BUT LOOKING AT JUST FROM AN 

21:14:34 OVERALL PERSPECTIVE, THERE KIND 

21:14:37 OF IS A BEST PRACTICES FOR KIND 

21:14:39 OF URBAN STREET DESIGN AND 

21:14:42 OPERATIONS, IS TO IF YOU CAN GET 

21:14:44 YOUR STREETS OPERATING AT 35 

21:14:46 MILES AN HOUR, YOUR MAJOR 

21:14:48 STREETS THAT'S DOING QUITE GOOD.

21:14:50 IT'S WHERE THE BIGs PROBLEMS 

21:14:51 OCCUR FROM THE SAFETY 

21:14:54 PERSPECTIVE IS WHEN YOUR SPEED 

21:14:55 LIMITS OR YOUR OPERATING SPEEDS 

21:14:58 ARE OVER 35 MILES AN HOUR.

21:15:00 SO PLACES WHERE YOUR LIMITS ARE 

21:15:02 40, 45 MILES AN HOUR, WHERE 

21:15:03 PEOPLE ARE DRIVING THAT FAST, 

21:15:06 THOSE ARE CONDITIONS WHERE YOU 

21:15:09 ARE GOING TO GET A HIGHER NUMBER 

21:15:12 OF FATAL OR SEVERE INJURY 

21:15:12 CRASHES.

21:15:14 FROM MY PERSPECTIVE IF WE COULD 

21:15:16 GET FOLKS TRAVELING 35 MILES AN 

21:15:18 HOUR, THAT WOULD BE A BIG STEP 

21:15:24 IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

21:15:24 >> Councilmember Keng:   ALL 

21:15:25 RIGHT, THANK YOU.

21:15:27 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

21:15:30 CLARIFYING QUESTIONS.

21:15:31 COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN.

21:15:32 >> Councilmember Kassan:   YES, 

21:15:33 A COUPLE OF THINGS.

21:15:36 NUMBER 1, JOHN HINES, A 

21:15:37 COMMUNITY RESIDENT WAS NICE 

21:15:39 ENOUGH TO SHARE WITH THE 

21:15:41 COUNCILMEMBERS A BREAKDOWN OF 

21:15:43 ALL THE DATA FROM THE SURVEY.

21:15:45 AND ACCORDING TO HIS ANALYSIS IF 

21:15:49 YOU COMBINE PEOPLE WHO LIVE ON 

21:15:51 PASEO PADRE, PEOPLE WHO DON'T, 

21:15:54 IT WAS 70% OF THE TOTAL THAT 

21:15:56 WERE OPPOSED.

21:15:59 I JUST WANTED TO ASK, IS THAT 

21:16:01 CONSISTENT WITH -- I KNOW YOU 

21:16:02 MAYBE DON'T HAVE IT RIGHT IN 

21:16:04 FRONT OF YOU BUT DOES THAT SOUND 

21:16:05 ABOUT CONSISTENT WITH WHAT YOU 

21:16:06 SAW?

21:16:07 INSTEAD OF SEPARATING OUT THOSE 

21:16:10 WHO DID LIVE ON PASEO AND THOSE 

21:16:12  

21:16:14 WHO DON'T, IT LOOKS LIKE OVERALL 

21:16:17 IT WAS 70% OPPOSED.

21:16:18 >> Hans Larsen:   THAT SOUNDS 

21:16:19 GENERALLY ACCURATE, YES.

21:16:21 AND WE HAVE POSTED ALL OF THE 

21:16:25 KIND OF THE RAW SURVEY DATA ON 

21:16:26 OUR WEBSITE.

21:16:26 >> Councilmember Kassan:   

21:16:28 THAT'S WHERE HE GOT IT SO HE WAS 

21:16:30 NICE ENOUGH TO SHARE THAT 

21:16:32 ANALYSIS WITH US IN AN E-MAIL.

21:16:33 MY OTHER QUESTION IS THAT I DO 

21:16:35 HAVE A CONCERN, I DON'T KNOW HOW 

21:16:36 THE VOTE'S GOING TO GO TONIGHT 

21:16:38 BUT IF A MAJORITY OF THE COUNCIL 

21:16:40 DOES VOTE TO CHOOSE THE OPTION 

21:16:42 THAT DOES NOT INCLUDE THE ROAD 

21:16:45 DIET, ARGUABLY THE CURRENT 

21:16:47 CONDITION IS ACTUALLY LESS SAFE 

21:16:49 THAN THE INITIAL CONDITION 

21:16:56 WITHOUT THE SUB-PAR BIKE LANE.

21:16:59 SO IT MIGHT BE PREMATURE TO ASK 

21:17:00 THIS BUT I'M JUST WONDERING IF 

21:17:02 THERE SHOULDN'T BE MAYBE A THIRD 

21:17:04 OPTION WHICH WOULD BE JUST TO GO 

21:17:05 BACK.

21:17:07 DO ALL OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS 

21:17:08 OTHER THAN THE ROAD DIET AND TO 

21:17:11 REMOVE THE SUBSTANDARD BIKE 

21:17:12 LANE, BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, THERE 

21:17:14 IS SOME REASONABLE ARGUMENTS 

21:17:16 THAT HAVING THAT BIKE LANE IS 

21:17:18 ACTUALLY CREATING A LESS SAFE 

21:17:19 CONDITION THAN THE ORIGINAL 

21:17:22 CONDITION.

21:17:23 >> Hans Larsen:   YEAH, A COUPLE 

21:17:24 OF THINGS ON THAT.

21:17:26 SO WE'VE HEARD THE CONCERN 

21:17:28 ABOUT, YOU KNOW, THE 74 FOOT 

21:17:31  FOUR FOOT 

21:17:32 BIKE LANE IS WHAT WE PUT IN 

21:17:35 THERE AS PART OF THE INTERIM 

21:17:37 CONDITION WHICH IS THE STANDARD 

21:17:39 IS KIND OF THE MINIMUM STANDARD 

21:17:41 IS FIVE FEET.

21:17:44 BUT YOU CAN ADJUST FROM THAT 

21:17:46 GIVEN SORT OF THE CONDITIONS IN 

21:17:46 THE AREA.

21:17:49 AND SO WHEN WE WENT WITH THE 

21:17:52 FOUR FOOT BIKE LANE, PART OF IT 

21:17:55 WAS WE FEEL THAT WITH AN 

21:17:56 ESTABLISHED EDGE LINE AT THE 

21:17:59 BIKE LANE THAT VEHICLES TEND TO 

21:18:02 TRAVEL MORE SLOWLY OR IN A 

21:18:04 CONSTRAINED AREA THAN IF THEY 

21:18:07 HAD 15 FEET TO GO IN AND THEN 

21:18:14 THERE WOULD BE A SHAREOW OR 

21:18:15 SOMETHING LIKE THAT, KIND OF A 

21:18:17 SHARED SPACE .

21:18:18 OUR CONCERN IS WITH THE HIGH 

21:18:20 SPEEDS THAT ARE THERE, NO ONE 

21:18:22 WOULD BE COMFORTABLE BICYCLING 

21:18:24 IN THAT SHARED SPACE.

21:18:25 THE ALTERNATIVE THAT WE'RE 

21:18:26 THINKING OF AND THIS IS, YOU 

21:18:29 KNOW, KIND OF A FINE POINT THAT 

21:18:31 WE DIDN'T REALLY ADDRESS IN THE 

21:18:34 RECOMMENDATION, IS THAT AS WE 

21:18:36 LOOK AT, IF THE DIRECTION IS SAY 

21:18:39 TO NOT GO WITH THE ROAD DIET, WE 

21:18:42 WOULD WANT TO TAKE A LOOK AT 

21:18:44 WHETHER WE WANT TO KEEP A FOUR 

21:18:46 FOOT BIKE LANE OR INCREASE IT TO 

21:18:51  

21:18:53 FIVE FEET AND THEN TAKE A HALF 

21:18:55 FOOT OUT OF EACH OF THE TWO 

21:18:55 LANES.

21:18:57 WE DO HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF SPACE 

21:18:59 NEXT TO THE MEDIAN ISLAND THAT 

21:19:02 WE COULD ALSO SQUEEZE DOWN AS 

21:19:04 WELL.

21:19:05 OUR SENSE HEARING THE COMMUNITY 

21:19:07 FEEDBACK AND CONCERNS OVER THE 

21:19:09 BICYCLING COMMUNITY AND FOLKS 

21:19:10 THAT HAVE ACTUALLY RIDDEN THEIR 

21:19:12 BIKE IN THE CORRIDOR I THINK 

21:19:14 WE'D OPT TO MAKES SOME TWEAKS TO 

21:19:16 THE DESIGN TO GET IT UP TO AT 

21:19:22 LEAST A MORE COMMONPLACE MINIMUM 

21:19:23 STANDARD AND WOULD PROVIDE A 

21:19:24 LITTLE BIT MORE ROOMENT FOR THE 

21:19:29  ROOM FOR THE 

21:19:30 BIKES IN THE CORRIDOR.

21:19:31 THAT'S HOW WE'RE THINKING ABOUT 

21:19:33 THAT ISSUE.

21:19:33 >> Councilmember Kassan:   OKAY 

21:19:34 THANK YOU.

21:19:36 >> Mayor Mei:   NEXT IS 

21:19:38 COUNCILMEMBER COX, CLARIFYING 

21:19:38 QUESTIONS.

21:19:50 >> Councilmember Cox:   I TOO 

21:19:52 WAS THINKING OF -- I APPRECIATE 

21:19:54 FIRST LARSON YOUR WORK IN DOING 

21:19:56 THIS TOGETHER AND I KNOW YOU'RE 

21:19:57 DOING A LOT OF WORK AND WORKING 

21:19:59 WITH THE COMMUNITY YOU AND YOUR 

21:20:00 TEAM SO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR 

21:20:04 THAT.

21:20:06 I DID WANT TO MAKE SURE I WAS 

21:20:07 THINKING ABOUT THAT.

21:20:08 BUT WHEN YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT 

21:20:10 REDUCING THE LANES AND I MEAN 

21:20:12 KEEPING THE TWO LANES BUT 

21:20:14 REDUCING IT YOU'RE SAYING BY A 

21:20:15 FOOT IS THAT WHAT I'M HEARING 

21:20:18 YOU COULD KIND OF HAVE A LITTLE 

21:20:20 WIGGLE ROOM THERE TO THEN 

21:20:22 INCREASE THE BIKE LANE TO FIVE 

21:20:23 FEET?

21:20:24 >> Hans Larsen:   YES, SO THERE 

21:20:27 IS RIGHT NOW A ONE 72nd OFFSET 

21:20:32  FOOT MEDIAN 

21:20:35 ACCESS NEXT TO THE MEDIAN LANE.

21:20:37 IT IS OUR TYPICAL PROCESS NOT TO 

21:20:39 PUT A TEN FOOT LANE RIGHT NEXT 

21:20:41 TO THE RAISED MEDIAN ISLAND.

21:20:45 BUT SO THERE'S ROOM TO SHORTEN 

21:20:46 THAT UP.

21:20:47 AND YOU CAN DESIGN THIS TO A 

21:20:49 HALF A FOOT DIMENSION.

21:20:55 OR YOU COULD TAKE THE TWO 

21:20:57 TEN-FOOT LANES AND MAKE THEM 

21:20:59 EACH NINE AND A HALF FEET AND 

21:21:01 THAT WOULD FREE UP AN EXTRA FOOT 

21:21:02 FOR THE BIKE LANE.

21:21:04 SO THERE'S SOME ADJUSTMENTS WE 

21:21:05 COULD DO.

21:21:07 GENERALLY WE ARE KIND OF A NEW 

21:21:10 STANDARD FOR LANES IS TEN FEET.

21:21:13 BUT IT IN SOME CASES YOU CAN 

21:21:15 SQUEEZE IT DOWN TO NINE FEET.

21:21:17 AND I THINK I'VE HEARD MAYOR MEI 

21:21:20 TALK TO HER GROWING UP IN 

21:21:22 PHILADELPHIA, AND ANYONE WHO'S 

21:21:24 TRAVELED IN EUROPE OR EASTERN 

21:21:31 PART OF THE U.S., LANE WIDTHS 

21:21:34 ARE A LOT TIGHTER THAN WHAT 

21:21:36 WE'VE BECOME ACCUSTOMED TO IN 

21:21:37 CALIFORNIA OR WESTERN PART OF 

21:21:38 THE U.S.

21:21:39 THERE IS PROBABLY MORE ROOM TO 

21:21:42 SQUEEZE DOWN THE AUTO LANES AND 

21:21:43 THEN SAVE MORE SPACE FOR THE 

21:21:45 MORE VULNERABLE USER, THAT BEING 

21:21:48 THE BICYCLIST IN THE CORRIDOR.

21:21:49 >> Councilmember Cox:   IF THAT 

21:21:51 IS THE CASE WHY WAS THAT ANOTHER 

21:21:53 OPTION THAT WE COULD HAVE HAD ON 

21:21:55 THE RECOMMENDATION SHEET?

21:21:56 >> Hans Larsen:   I THINK WE 

21:21:59 WERE DISCUSSING THIS AMONGST 

21:22:01 STAFF, YOU KNOW AFTER WE PUT OUR 

21:22:02 REPORT OUT.

21:22:06 I THINK THAT'S A -- AND SO WE 

21:22:08 WERE KIND OF PREPARED FOR THAT 

21:22:09 POTENTIAL QUESTION.

21:22:11 I THINK THE MAIN THING REALLY 

21:22:13 COMES DOWN IS, THE NUMBER OF 

21:22:14 LANES THAT WE RUN IN THE 

21:22:15 CORRIDOR.

21:22:17 IS IT ONE LANE OR TWO LANES?

21:22:19 AND THEN, YOU KNOW, WE WILL DO 

21:22:23 THE BEST WE CAN TO MAKE IT AS 

21:22:27 SAFE AS POSSIBLE AND MANAGE ANY 

21:22:29 LIABILITY FOR THE CITY IN TERMS 

21:22:30 OF KIND OF WHAT THE OPTIMAL 

21:22:31 DESIGN IS.

21:22:33 SO I THINK FOR THE COUNCIL 

21:22:34 TONIGHT REALLY THE KEY QUESTION 

21:22:38 IS, THE PACKAGE OF SAFETY 

21:22:45 IMPROVEMENTS AND THEN THE ROAD 

21:22:48 DIET, WHETHER WE DO ONE OR TWO.

21:22:50 I'D BE HAPPY TO KIND OF PUT THE 

21:22:51 SLIDE BACK UP FOR COUNCIL IN 

21:22:53 TERMS OF THE DEFINITION OF 

21:22:56 OPTION 1 AND 2 IF YOU'D LIKE.

21:22:57 >> Mayor Mei:   THAT WOULD BE --

21:22:58 >> Councilmember Cox:   WE HAVE 

21:22:59 ONLY TWO OPTIONS TO LOOK AT 

21:23:00 TONIGHT.

21:23:02 AND IF WE WANTED TO CONSIDER THE 

21:23:04 THIRD OPTION, WE WOULD STILL 

21:23:07 MAKE IT A TWO-LANE AND JUST 

21:23:10 WIDEN THE BIKE LANE, BUT THEN 

21:23:13 MAKING THE AUTO LANE JUST A 

21:23:14 LITTLE BIT SMALLER.

21:23:18 THERE IS NO OPTION FOR THAT AT 

21:23:18 THIS TIME?

21:23:25 >> COUNCILMEMBER COX --

21:23:26 >> Hans Larsen:   COUNCILMEMBER 

21:23:28 WHAT I WOULD SAY IF THE COUNCIL, 

21:23:30 BETWEEN OPTION 1 AND 2 WHICH IS 

21:23:31 REALLY THE QUESTION ABOUT THE 

21:23:33 ROAD DIET, IF THE PREFERENCE 

21:23:36 FROM COUNCIL WAS OPTION 2, I 

21:23:39 THINK THEN WE WOULD, YOU KNOW, 

21:23:41 BE HAPPY TO RECEIVE DIRECTION TO 

21:23:43 KIND OF LOOK AT A REFINED 

21:23:47 CONFIGURATION, FOR TWO LANES IN 

21:23:49 EACH DIRECTION ADDRESS BEING 

21:23:50 CONCERNS ABOUT THE WIDTH OF THE 

21:23:51 BIKE LANE.

21:23:54 AND THEN WE WOULD PROBABLY JUST 

21:23:55 COME BACK TO YOU WITH AN 

21:23:58 INFORMATIONAL ITEM ON THAT IN 

21:24:00 REVIEW WITH OUR ATTORNEY'S 

21:24:01 OFFICE ON WHAT WE THINK IS THE 

21:24:06 OPTIMAL WAY TO CONFIGURE AN 

21:24:10 OPTION 2 RECOMMENDATION.

21:24:11 >> COUNCILMEMBER COX WITH THIS 

21:24:12 RECOMMENDATION BEFORE YOU TODAY 

21:24:14 AS WITH ANY OTHER 

21:24:15 RECOMMENDATIONS, THE COUNCIL IS 

21:24:17 FREE TO MAKE WHATEVER AMENDMENTS 

21:24:19 OR REVISIONS AS YOU MAKE A 

21:24:21 MOTION ON THE RECOMMENDATION.

21:24:22 SO IF YOU WANTED TO CONSIDER 

21:24:26 OTHER OPTIONS, YOU'RE PERFECTLY 

21:24:28 WELCOME TO DO THAT.

21:24:30 YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU MAKE A MOTION 

21:24:32 OR IF SOMEONE ELSE MAKES A 

21:24:34 MOTION YOU CAN OFFER A FRIENDLY 

21:24:36 AMENDMENT TO THAT MOTION.

21:24:38 >> Councilmember Cox:   OKAY.

21:24:38 >> Karena Shackelford:   BUT 

21:24:39 TODAY THE TWO RECOMMENDATIONS 

21:24:41 YOU HAVE BEFORE YOU TODAY ARE 

21:24:43 THE STAFF RECOMMENDATIONS THAT 

21:24:47 WE FEEL MOST ALIGN WITH THE 

21:24:50 VISION ZERO POLICY AND THE 

21:24:52 MOBILITY ACTION PLAN.

21:24:52 >> Councilmember Cox:   OKAY, 

21:24:54 THANK YOU FOR CLARIFYING THAT.

21:24:59 I APPRECIATE THAT.

21:25:00 WHAT WAS MY OTHER QUESTION?

21:25:05 I WAS GOING TO ASK, THERE WAS 

21:25:07 A -- I GUESS WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING 

21:25:09 AT THE PEDESTRIAN FLASHING 

21:25:12 BEACONS ON LINE 2, IF YOU COULD 

21:25:14 JUST SHOW THAT ONE MORE TIME, I 

21:25:16 THINK THERE WAS A -- EITHER YOU 

21:25:25 WERE LOOKING AT DORN PLACE AND 

21:25:27 AT MENTO OR OLIVE, WHICH ONE 

21:25:31 WOULD BE THE BETTER CHOICE?

21:25:34 SO THERE'S ACTUALLY TWO BEACONS 

21:25:37 THAT WE WOULD HAVE, RIGHT?

21:25:39 >> Hans Larsen:   YEAH AND LET 

21:25:40 ME JUST GO BACK --

21:25:41 >> Councilmember Cox:   WHICH 

21:25:43 ONE WOULD BE THE BETTER ONE AT 

21:25:46 MENTO I THINK THAT'S WHERE THE 

21:25:50 BETH ISRAEL TORAH TEMPLE IS 

21:25:54 LOCATED THERE ATMEN TO.

21:26:04  AT MENTO.

21:26:05 >> Hans Larsen:   THE FLASHING 

21:26:07 BEACONS ARE ORIENTED TO WHERE WE 

21:26:12 HAVE A CRASHING CONVENTION, AT 

21:26:14 PASEO PADRE PARKWAY CORRIDOR, 

21:26:15 THOSE HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED TO 

21:26:18 THE SAFE WEIGH TO SCHOOLS 

21:26:20 PROGRAM.

21:26:22 THE MENTO IS THE LOCATION WHERE 

21:26:24 THE SCHOOL CROSSING, THERE IS A 

21:26:26 STRIPED CROSSWALK THERE NOW SO 

21:26:31 THAT BECOMES THE LOGICAL PLACE 

21:26:33 TO LOCATE IT.

21:26:35 ON THE DEEPER ANALYSIS OF THE 

21:26:37 TOPIC THERE ARE A HIGHER NUMBER 

21:26:39 OF CRASHES AT OLIVE.

21:26:40 OLIVE BECAUSE OF THE CURVATURE 

21:26:42 AND THE SITE DISTANCE, A 

21:26:44 CROSSWALK HAS NOT BEEN LOCATED 

21:26:45 THERE.

21:26:47 BECAUSE IT'S HARDER TO SEE IT.

21:26:52 AND THAT'S WHY MENTO WAS 

21:26:54 SELECTED.

21:26:59 MENTO WAS ALSO ADJACENT TO THE 

21:27:03  

21:27:05 SYNAGOGUE AND SCHOOL THERE.

21:27:07 SO THERE'S KIND OF A LOGIC TO 

21:27:09 THAT LOCATION AS WELL.

21:27:11 SO I DON'T THINK WE HAVE DONE A 

21:27:12 DEEP ENOUGH ANALYSIS IN TERMS OF 

21:27:13 OKAY WHAT IS OPTIMAL.

21:27:16 AND IT KIND OF DEPENDS, YOU 

21:27:18 KNOW, WITH ROAD DIET OR NOT.

21:27:19 IF YOU ONLY HAD TWO LANES TO 

21:27:24 CROSS THEN IT MAY AFFECT THE 

21:27:27 SITE DISTANCE AND THE SPEEDS.

21:27:29 AND SO THERE MAY BE A DIFFERENT 

21:27:30 CHOICE.

21:27:32 AND SO I THINK WE'RE GENERALLY 

21:27:35 LOOKING FOR YOUR GUIDANCE 

21:27:37 TONIGHT ON SORT OF THE PACKAGE, 

21:27:39 GENERALLY SHOULD WE PUT MORE 

21:27:41 FLASHING BEACONS IN THE 

21:27:41 CORRIDOR?

21:27:43 AND THEN WE'LL DO THE TECHNICAL 

21:27:46 ANALYSIS TO BASICALLY DETERMINE 

21:27:47 REALLY WHERE'S THE BEST PLACE 

21:27:50 FOR IT TO GO.

21:27:50 >> Councilmember Cox:   YOU 

21:27:53 WOULD JUST KIND OF DO A PILOT 

21:27:54 FIRST AND THEN BEFORE YOU 

21:27:55 INSTALLED IT PERMANENTLY IS THAT 

21:27:57 WHAT YOU 19?

21:27:58 >> Hans Larsen:   WELL, I THINK 

21:28:00 WE WOULD COLLECT MORE DATA, 

21:28:01 PARTICULARLY WHEN SCHOOL IS IN 

21:28:06 SESSION, AND OBSERVE HOW IT -- 

21:28:10 YOU KNOW WHAT WERE THE HOW 

21:28:12 PEOPLE ARE USING IT AND 

21:28:13 DETERMINING WHAT MAKES MORE 

21:28:14 SENSE.

21:28:16 SO MENTO IS WHERE THE CROSSING 

21:28:19 IS NOW AND IT'S PRIMARILY DRIVEN 

21:28:22 BY THAT'S A SAFER PLACE FOR A 

21:28:23 CROSSWALK THAN OLIVE BECAUSE OF 

21:28:27 THE LIMITED SITE DISTANCE.

21:28:34 BUT, YOU KNOW, THE OLIVE KIND OF 

21:28:35 SERVES THE FOLKS THAT ARE TRYING 

21:28:38 TO GET BACK TO MISSION SAN JOSE 

21:28:40 HIGH SCHOOL SO THERE'S SOME PROS 

21:28:41 AND CONS WITH EACH OF THE 

21:28:43 LOCATIONS AND WE'D WANT TO STUDY 

21:28:45 IT FIRST BUT I THINK THE KEY 

21:28:48 POLICY CHOICE IS, DO WE WANT TO 

21:28:50 INVEST IN MORE SAFE CROSSINGS 

21:28:53 USING SIGNALS AND FLASHING 

21:28:55 BEACONS AND THAT I THINK IS THE 

21:28:57 MAIN THING WE'RE ASKING YOUR 

21:28:58 FEEDBACK ON.

21:29:00 AND FROM WHAT WE'VE HEARD FROM 

21:29:01 ALL THE POLLING IN THE 

21:29:04 COMMUNITY, THE ANSWERS ARE A 

21:29:06 PRETTY STRONG YES THAT MORE 

21:29:08 FLASHING BEACONS ARE GOOD.

21:29:09 >> Councilmember Cox:   RIGHT.

21:29:11 NOW WOULD YOUR BUDGET ALLOW FOR 

21:29:14 BOTH OF THEM?

21:29:15 YOU KNOW, THAT YOU COULD HAVE IT 

21:29:17 AT THREE STREETS INSTEAD OF TWO?

21:29:19 >> Hans Larsen:   THAT IS -- 

21:29:22 THAT IS CERTAINLY A POSSIBILITY.

21:29:25 YES, I MEAN WE'D BE OPEN TO 

21:29:26 ENTERTAINING THAT.

21:29:27 I THINK WE'D WANT TO JUST LOOK 

21:29:29 AT IT FURTHER.

21:29:31 WE WOULD USE IT AND IS THERE 

21:29:34 ENOUGH BENEFIT, ON ONE OF THE 

21:29:36 TWO LOCATIONS OR POSSIBLY EVEN A 

21:29:37 THIRD.

21:29:39 YEAH I WOULDN'T -- WOULDN'T 

21:29:40 DISMISS THE ABILITY TO DO 

21:29:41 ANOTHER ONE.

21:29:44 I MEAN FLASHING BEACONS ARE A 

21:29:46 RELATIVELY INEXPENSIVE 

21:29:47 INVESTMENT GIVEN THE SAFETY 

21:29:49 BENEFIT THAT THEY PROVIDE.

21:29:49 >> Councilmember Cox:   

21:29:50 ABSOLUTELY.

21:29:51 I FULLY AGREE.

21:29:54 AND SAFETY FIRST AND ALSO, YOU 

21:29:56 GET THE VOLUME DISCOUNT IF YOU 

21:30:01 BUY MORE THAN ONE, TOO.

21:30:04 THAT HELPS ME IN MAKING -- 

21:30:06 UNDERSTANDING THAT PART OF YOUR 

21:30:06 RECOMMENDATION.

21:30:08 SO THANK YOU FOR CLARIFYING 

21:30:09 THAT.

21:30:10 COULD YOU JUST PUT THAT UP ONE 

21:30:11 MORE TIME?

21:30:13 I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE I 

21:30:15 COVERED ALL MISOTHER QUESTIONS.

21:30:16 >> Hans Larsen:   ON THE 

21:30:17 RECOMMENDATION?

21:30:17 >> Councilmember Cox:   YES.

21:30:20 OKAY, COVINGTON.

21:30:25 OKAY.

21:30:25 GOT IT.

21:30:27 I THINK IT GOT MOST OF MY 

21:30:31 QUESTIONS ANSWERED.

21:30:37 AND HOLD ON JUST LOOKING.

21:30:38 I THINK I GOT MY QUESTIONS 

21:30:39 ANSWERED.

21:30:40 THANK YOU VERY MUCH, I 

21:30:40 APPRECIATE IT.

21:30:43 >> Mayor Mei:   SIGNIFICANT 

21:30:45 NUMBER OF SPEAKERS AND I WANTED 

21:30:47 TO BE RESPECTFUL OF THE TIME AND 

21:30:49 PEOPLE HAVE BEEN WAITING TO HEAR 

21:30:50 THIS ITEM THIS EVENING.

21:30:53 BUT I'M ALSO COGNIZANT OF THE 

21:30:54 TIME THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE DUE 

21:30:55 FOR ANOTHER BREAK.

21:30:57 SO I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT 

21:30:59 I'M GOING TO GO WITH A MINUTE 

21:31:00 AND A HALF EACH AND I'M THINKING 

21:31:02 THERE WILL BE MORE SPEAKERS WHO 

21:31:05 WILL RAISE THEIR HAND.

21:31:08 BUT PLEASE NOTE THAT WHEN I'M 

21:31:09 GIVING YOU A MINUTE AND A HALF 

21:31:11 IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO USE ALL 

21:31:12 THE TIME.

21:31:14 AND IF SPEAKERS BEFORE REFLECT 

21:31:16 YOUR COMMENT PLEASE LET US KNOW 

21:31:17 THAT YOU'RE IN AGREEMENT WITH 

21:31:20 THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER.

21:31:22 AND THAT THIS WILL ALLOW US TO 

21:31:24 HAVE MORE TIME TO HAVE THE 

21:31:25 DISCUSSION AND FOR YOU TO HAVE 

21:31:27 OUR COMMENTS AND 

21:31:28 DECISION-MAKING.

21:31:29 SO I'LL BEGIN WITH THE FIRST 

21:31:32 SPEAKER, RAY STORMS, WELCOME.

21:31:36 >> YES, HELLO, GOOD AFTERNOON, 

21:31:38 GOOD EVENING.

21:31:40 I'VE LIVED IN FREMONT FOR 54 

21:31:41 YEARS.

21:31:42 I LIVE UP IN THE MISSION SAN 

21:31:44 JOSE AREA FOR THE LAST 35.

21:31:47 AND I'VE SEEN THE CHANGES.

21:31:51 DRISCOLL, THE BOLLARDS HAVE BEEN 

21:31:51 HIT.

21:31:54 I DON'T WANT THE DIET.

21:31:55 ALL THE OTHER THINGS I THINK ARE 

21:31:56 GREAT.

21:32:00 BUT I TRAVELED PASEO PADRE TO 

21:32:02 680, IT WAS TAKING ME AT ONE 

21:32:04 TIME 40 MINUTES TO GET ON THE 

21:32:05 FREEWAY.

21:32:07 WHEN I WAS ONLY DRIVING 20 

21:32:09 MINUTES DOWN THE FREEWAY TO 

21:32:11 PLEASANTON WHICH WAS RIDICULED 

21:32:16  RIDICULOUS, 

21:32:18 BECAUSE TRAFFIC WAS BACKED UP 

21:32:19 DOWN WASHINGTON.

21:32:21 IF YOU DO THE ROAD DIET IT'S 

21:32:23 GOING TO BE SAME THING, THERE 

21:32:25 YOU GO, WE'RE SUPPOSED TO KEEP 

21:32:26 TRAFFIC MOVING.

21:32:27 I AGREE YOU NEED TO LESSEN THE 

21:32:28 SPEEDS.

21:32:30 I THINK THOSE LIGHTS, I THINK 

21:32:32 THE FLASHING SIGNS WILL HELP, I 

21:32:34 THINK WE SHOULD TAKE IT ONE STEP 

21:32:36 AT A TIME AND SEE HOW IT WORKS.

21:32:39 BE CAREFUL ABOUT NARROWING THE 

21:32:40 LANES.

21:32:43 THESE DAYS, SO MANY DRIVERS ARE 

21:32:44 DISTRACTED BY THEIR PHONES.

21:32:47 THAT HALF A LANE, MAYBE IT WOULD 

21:32:49 BE, I APPRECIATE THAT.

21:32:51 I'M FOR OPTION NUMBER 2.

21:32:52 THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.

21:32:54 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU RAY.

21:32:57 THE NEXT SPEAKER WILL BE 

21:32:59 MANHUGHES.

21:32:59 WELCOME NORM.

21:33:07  BE NORMAN 

21:33:08 HUGHES.

21:33:12 PLEASE UNMUTE YOURSELF NORM.

21:33:13 OKAY.

21:33:15 NORM YOU'RE STILL MUTED.

21:33:19 I WILL GO TO THE NEXT SPEAKER 

21:33:23 AND COME BACK TO NORMAN.

21:33:32 BOPAL PADMA KRISHNAN.

21:33:33 >> GOOD EVENING COUNCIL, I LIVE 

21:33:36 ON PASEO PADRE, I KNOW IT'S ON 

21:33:40 THE MAIN DOOR, I BOUGHT MY HOUSE 

21:33:43 KNOWING IT WAS ON THE MAYBE 

21:33:43 DOOR.

21:33:45 UNLIKE PASEO PADRE NORTH AND 

21:33:47 SOUTH OF HERE I FULLY SUPPORT 

21:33:49 SMART SIGNALS TO HELP EXIT 

21:33:51 SAFELY FROM MY OWN DRIVEWAY.

21:33:52 I SUPPORT A NEW TRAFFIC LIGHT.

21:33:54 BUT I WOULD LIKE TO SUGGEST IT 

21:33:56 BE PUT AT OLIVE TO SLOW DOWN THE 

21:33:58 SPEEDING FROM 680 OVERPASS AND I 

21:34:03 ALSO SUGGEST LOOKING AT HOCKS 

21:34:07 INSTEAD OF BEACONS TO CROSS 

21:34:11 PASEO PADRE SAFELY ON FOOT OR 

21:34:12 BICYCLES.

21:34:13 THE DRIVERS COULD MISS IT.

21:34:15 I DO NOT SUPPORT THE ROAD DIET 

21:34:17 AS IT IS NOT IN THE INTEREST OF 

21:34:18 OUR COMMUNITY AND IT IS NOT 

21:34:20 SUPPORTED WITH A MAJORITY OF THE 

21:34:21 RESIDENTS OF FREMONT.

21:34:24 THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

21:34:25 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

21:34:28 THE NEXT SPEAKER IS NORMAN 

21:34:29 HUGHES.

21:34:34 >> HELLO.

21:34:37 SORRY, I HAD MY TALK OVER THE 

21:34:39 SCREEN THAT POPPED UP MUTE SO I 

21:34:42 DIDN'T KNOW THAT IT SAID THAT.

21:34:43 IT'S BEEN SIX YEARS SINCE I 

21:34:45 SPOKE TO CITY COUNCIL AS PUBLIC 

21:34:46 WORKS DIRECTOR.

21:34:49 AFTER PASSING THE TORCH I'VE 

21:34:51 REFRAINED FROM PUBLIC COMMENTS.

21:34:53 HOWEVER, THE OPPORTUNITY FOR 

21:34:56 INCREASED PUBLIC SAFETY IS SO 

21:35:00 IMPORTANT HAS SUGGESTED I SHOULD 

21:35:02 SPEAK ON OPTION 1.

21:35:04 NEEDED SAFETY IMPROVEMENT IMPACT 

21:35:06 FOR A MAJORITY OF THE CORRIDOR.

21:35:08 ESPECIALLY THE MOST DANGEROUS 

21:35:11 SPEEDING AREAS BETWEEN OLIVE AND 

21:35:13 WASHINGTON.

21:35:15 CONGESTION CONCERNS ARE OF THE 

21:35:18 PUBLIC ARE UNDERSTANDABLE AND 

21:35:21 ENDANGERING THIS CRITICAL SAFETY 

21:35:21 INITIATIVE.

21:35:23 STAFF HAS CLEARLY ADDRESSED THIS 

21:35:25 CONCERN IN THE STAFF REPORT AND 

21:35:26 HANS HAS DONE A GOOD JOB DOING 

21:35:28 IT AGAIN TONIGHT CONFIRMING THAT 

21:35:30 THE CONGESTION WAS NOT EXPECTED 

21:35:32 FROM THIS ROAD DIET BECAUSE THE 

21:35:35 680 CORRIDOR HAS BEEN IMPROVED 

21:35:37 BY AN ADDITIONAL LANE.

21:35:43 THE LANE REDUCTION WILL SLOW 

21:35:45 TRAFFIC AND WILL REDUCE 

21:35:48 ACCIDENTS BY MOVING CARS AWAY 

21:35:51 FROM THE PARKED LANE SO THERE'S 

21:35:56 MORE VISIBILITY ON THE DISTANCE 

21:35:58 CURVES THAT HANS TALKED ABOUT.

21:35:59 IT WILL SHORTEN THE CROSSING 

21:36:01 DISTANCES AS HANS SAID.

21:36:07 THE ROAD DIET WILL GREATLY 

21:36:08 IMPROVE THE SITUATION FOR 

21:36:10 BICYCLES BECAUSE THEY WILL HAVE 

21:36:17 ROOM TO MANEUVER AND NOT --

21:36:18 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU, NORM.

21:36:20 NEXT SPEAKER I'M GOING TO CALL 

21:36:21 UP IS ACTUALLY SOMEONE WHO 

21:36:24 RAISED HIS HAND ON I THINK IT 

21:36:28 WAS ON THE PUBLIC COMMENTS BUT I 

21:36:30 APOLOGIZE, IT WAS AT THE WRONG 

21:36:36 TIME, WHICH WAS PORASHOTHAM 

21:36:37 PEDIREDI.

21:36:44 THOUGHT I JUST SAW HIM.

21:36:44 >> OKAY.

21:36:46 CAN YOU HEAR ME?

21:36:47 >> Mayor Mei:   YES.

21:36:49 >> HI, GOOD EVENING, MAYOR MEI 

21:36:52 AND CITY COUNCIL, ON OCTOBER 12, 

21:36:57 2021, WE PASEO PADRE PARKWAY 

21:36:59 RESIDENTS AS WELL AS RESIDENTS, 

21:37:06 SUBMITTED A IMPLEMENT THEN MADE 

21:37:10 THE SAFETY WORSER, AND THANK YOU 

21:37:14 FOR THE CITY STAFF FOR 

21:37:15 CANCELLING OUR PETITION AND 

21:37:18 COMING UP WITH THIS PROPOSAL.

21:37:19 DISTRICT NOTE, BEFORE WE LEAVE 

21:37:22 THE HOUSE WE LOCK IT TO KEEP IT 

21:37:22 SAFE.

21:37:24 BEFORE WE LEAVE THE CAR WE LOCK 

21:37:26 IT TO KEEP IT SAFE.

21:37:28 AFTER WE ARE DONE WORKING ON OUR 

21:37:29 COMPUTERS WE LOCK IT TO KEEP IT 

21:37:30 SAFE.

21:37:33 BUT WHY IS THERE SO MUCH 

21:37:34 INTEREST IN KEEPING THE LIFE 

21:37:35 SAFE.

21:37:37 I GUESS ONE DOESN'T NEED TO BE 

21:37:38 INVOLVED IN AN ACCIDENT OR 

21:37:41 IMPACTED BY A FATAL ACCIDENT TO 

21:37:43 REALIZE THE VALUE OF THE LIFE.

21:37:46 I REQUEST CITY COUNCIL TO NOT 

21:37:48 TAKE SAFETY LIGHTLY AND HELP 

21:37:52 ROADS BECOME MUCH SAFER.

21:37:57 I HOPE CITY COUNCIL'S OPTION 1 

21:37:59 BECAUSE THAT IS A MORE SAFER 

21:38:02 OPTION, AND GOES WITH THAT 

21:38:03 OPTION.

21:38:07 IF OPTION PLEASE CONSULTATION I 

21:38:08 THINK CITY COUNCIL SHOULD 

21:38:11 CONSIDER TAKING BIKE LANE 

21:38:14 COMPLETELY AND HAVING STOP SIGNS 

21:38:18 OR SIGNALS AT MENTO AND OLIVE, 

21:38:20 OTHERWISE IT WON'T MAKE IT ANY 

21:38:20 SAFER.

21:38:21 THANK YOU.

21:38:21 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

21:38:28 THE NEXT SPEAKER IS ALA KRISHNA 

21:38:32 ALAPADYA.

21:38:33 >> HELLO GOOD EVENING EVERYBODY.

21:38:35 SO I LIVE OR DRISCOLL RODE.

21:38:40  ROAD, I 

21:38:42 AGREE WITH THE PAST TWO SPEAKERS 

21:38:43 THAT SPOKE.

21:38:45 WE PROMOTE OPTION 2 WITHOUT THE 

21:38:46 ROAD DIET.

21:38:49 AND WE SAW SOME BULBOUTS WHICH 

21:38:51 HAVE BEEN DONE ON DRISCOLL AND 

21:38:52 WASHINGTON.

21:38:55 I LIVE ON TIMBER CREEK ON 

21:38:57 DRISCOLL AND IT HAS CREATED 

21:38:58 THREE MAJOR ISSUES FOR US.

21:39:01 ONE IS WE ARE NOT ABLE TO TURN 

21:39:02 LEFT FROM OUR COMMUNITY SAFELY 

21:39:04 AND TRAFFIC IS BACKED UP.

21:39:06 NUMBER 2 WE ARE NOT ABLE TO GO 

21:39:08 TO WORK INCLUDING MY WIFE WORKS 

21:39:10 AS A PARAEDUCATOR AND SHE IS NOT 

21:39:12 ABLE TO GET TO SCHOOL ON TIME 

21:39:13 BECAUSE OF THE TRAFFIC 

21:39:15 CONGESTION AND NUMBER 3 IF PASEO 

21:39:17 PADRE BECOMES A SINGLE LANE AS 

21:39:19 COUPLE OF THE SPEAKERS SAID 

21:39:20 THERE ARE FIVE SCHOOLS THERE, IT 

21:39:22 IS GOING TO BE A TREMENDOUS RUSH 

21:39:24 IN THE MORNING.

21:39:25 AND I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO 

21:39:27 BE ANY SAFER BECAUSE THAT RUSH 

21:39:29 IS GOING TO KEEP FRUSTRATING THE 

21:39:31 DRIVERS.

21:39:33 SO WE RECOMMEND OPTION 2 WITHOUT 

21:39:36 THE ROAD DIET AND WE LIKE THE 

21:39:37 SAFETY MEASURES WHAT IS BEING 

21:39:39 PROPOSED IN OPTION 2.

21:39:39 THANK YOU SO MUCH.

21:39:42 HAVE A GREAT DAY.

21:39:43 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

21:39:49 THE NEXT SPEAKER IS AYUSH 

21:39:49 SHREDAR.

21:39:52 >> HELLO, I'M A SOPHOMORE IN 

21:39:53 MISSION SAN JOSE HIGH SCHOOL AND 

21:39:54 I'VE TRIED TO BIKE TO SCHOOL AND 

21:39:57 THERE IS NO WAY TO SAFELY CROSS 

21:40:02 AT -- ON PASEO AT OLIVE MENTO 

21:40:03 AND COVINGTON.

21:40:05 SPECIFICALLY OLIVE, THAT IS 

21:40:06 WHERE A LOT OF STUDENTS GO TO 

21:40:09 SCHOOL, NOT MENTO BECAUSE IT 

21:40:11 DOESN'T SAFELY CORRECT.

21:40:14 WE VOFN TO WAIT TWO OR THREE 

21:40:16 MINUTES FOR SOMEONE TO TAKE PITY 

21:40:18 ON ME AND SLOW DOWN.

21:40:20 THE BIKE LANE ON PASEO IS NOT 

21:40:22 CRITICAL FOR US.

21:40:25 THERE ARE ALSO SEEDS IN MANY 

21:40:27 LOCATIONS THAT CAUSE FLAT TIRES, 

21:40:29 SOMETHING THAT I'VE EXPERIENCED 

21:40:31 SEVERAL TIMES SO I SUPPORT THE 

21:40:33 BEACONS AND I SUPPORT OPTION 2 

21:40:34 AND I DON'T THINK MAKING ONE 

21:40:36 LANE WILL REALLY HELP US.

21:40:39 THANK YOU.

21:40:40 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

21:40:49 NEXT SPEAKER IS WAY FUN ZANG.

21:40:50 >> COULD YOU HEAR ME?

21:40:51 >> Mayor Mei:   YES, PLEASE GO 

21:40:53 AHEAD.

21:40:55 >> THANK YOU FOR THIS MEETING.

21:40:58 ACTUALLY, SO THE TRAFFIC WILL BE 

21:41:00 GETTING WORSE.

21:41:03 THE THING IS, I THINK WE ALL 

21:41:05 KNOW THE HOPKINS JUNIOR HIGH 

21:41:06 WILL BECOME THE MIDDLE SCHOOL, 

21:41:07 RIGHT?

21:41:09 SO THEN WE HAVE ONE MORE YEAR OF 

21:41:11 ALL THE KIDS WILL GO TO THE 

21:41:12 JUNIOR HIGH.

21:41:14 SO THAT MEANS THAT TRAFFIC WILL 

21:41:17 BE GETTING WORSE.

21:41:18 ALSO OVERALL POPULATION IS 

21:41:19 GETTING MORE.

21:41:22 PRESENTLY I LIKE EARLIER SO MANY 

21:41:24 PEOPLE SUGGEST OPTION 2.

21:41:26 I THINK OPTION 2 DEFINITELY IS 

21:41:28 BETTER, AND MORE PRACTICAL 

21:41:29 APPROACH.

21:41:31 REDUCE YOING THE LANE WILL MAKE 

21:41:33 THE SITUATION WORSE.

21:41:37 SO PLEASE, YOU KNOW, 70% OF 

21:41:40 PEOPLE PREFER OPTION TWOA AND 

21:41:42 THERE ARE ALL SMART PEOPLE SO 

21:41:47 PLEASE GO FOR OPTION 2, THANKS.

21:41:51 >> Mayor Mei:   NEXT SPEAKER IS 

21:41:56 DARCY OR NOLAN HUGHES.

21:41:59 >> MY NAME IS NOLAN HUGHES, I'VE 

21:42:01 BEEN A RESIDENT ON PASEO PADRE 

21:42:03 WITH FRONTAGE FOR 50 YEARS.

21:42:04 STAFF HAS REPORTED FIVE 

21:42:06 ACCIDENTS ON AVERAGE PER YEAR IN 

21:42:08 THIS SEGMENT, IN MY TIME MORE 

21:42:10 THAN FIVE CARS HAVE CRASHED 

21:42:11 THROUGH MY FENCE.

21:42:14 THE LAST CAUSED BY A 45 

21:42:15 MILE-AN-HOUR SPEEDER THAT SHOT A 

21:42:19 CAR INTO MY YARD AT MORE THAN 30 

21:42:20 MILES PER HOUR.

21:42:21 HAD I BEEN WORKING THERE AS I 

21:42:23 OFTEN DID I WOULD NOT BE 

21:42:24 SPEAKING TO YOU TODAY.

21:42:27 A BUS THAT DEPOSITS KIDS FROM 

21:42:31 HOPKINS AND MISSION AT THIS VERY 

21:42:33 LOCATION, AMONGST STAFF 

21:42:35 PROPOSALS THE ROAD DIET IS THE 

21:42:36 MOST IMPORTANT TO REDUCE 

21:42:38 SPEEDING AND VISIBILITY.

21:42:41 I KNOW MANY FELLOW CITIZENS 

21:42:43 OPPOSE IT BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT 

21:42:45 INFORMED ABOUT THE FACTS.

21:42:47 FORTUNATELY STAFF HAS CLEARLY 

21:42:48 SHOWED THAT ROAD CONGESTION WILL 

21:42:50 NOT OCCUR AND THAT THESE 

21:42:52 CONCERNS ARE UNWARRANTED.

21:42:54 I TRUST THAT THESE FOLKS REALLY 

21:42:57 UNDERSTOOD THAT THEY'RE CHOOSING 

21:43:00 THEIR CONVENIENCE, THAT ISN'T 

21:43:03 EVEN A CONVENIENCE BECAUSE IT IS 

21:43:07 NOT FACTUAL, OVER SAFETY OR THEY 

21:43:09 WOULD CHANGE THEIR MIND.

21:43:11 REJECT IT BASED ON A PERCEIVED 

21:43:13 BUT FALSE EXPECTATION OF 

21:43:15 INCREASED CONGESTION.

21:43:17 THIS IS AN EASY CHOICE.

21:43:18 WE HAVE TO PROTECT PUBLIC 

21:43:19 SAFETY.

21:43:21 THE WELL MEANING BUT MISPLACED 

21:43:25 FEAR OF CONGESTION MUST BE 

21:43:26 OBJECTED.

21:43:28 LIFE MATTERS TOO MUCH.

21:43:29 APPROVE OPTION 1.

21:43:30 THANK YOU.

21:43:31 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

21:43:34 THE NEXT SPEAKER IS SHREDAR.

21:43:39 >> GOOD EVENING EVERYBODY.

21:43:40 I LIVE ON PASEO PADRE.

21:43:43 I BELIEVE THAT REDUCING FROM TWO 

21:43:46 LANES TO ONE LANE IS A MISGUIDED 

21:43:47 SOLUTION TO ADDRESSING THE 

21:43:48 SPEEDING ISSUE.

21:43:50 I THINK IT SOUNDS LIKE MORE LIKE 

21:43:53 COMPLETING THE MASTER BIKE PLAN 

21:43:54 THAT'S DISGUISED AS A SAFETY 

21:43:55 MEASURE.

21:43:57 I THINK THAT'S PRETTY LOW 

21:43:59 UTILIZATION PARKING LANE AND A 

21:44:01 STANDARD BIKE LANE FOR THE 

21:44:05 HANDFUL OF BIKERS WHO USE THAT.

21:44:07 AND REMOVING A VEHICLE LANE IS 

21:44:08 UNNECESSARY.

21:44:10 PLEASE FOLLOW THE 

21:44:12 RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE SURVEY 

21:44:13 RESULTS.

21:44:14 OPTION 2 IS THE WAY TO GO.

21:44:21 THANK YOU.

21:44:24 >> Mayor Mei:   NEXT SPEAKER IS 

21:44:25 SHARON VENTURA.

21:44:28 SHARON PLEASE --

21:44:30 >> HI CAN YOU HEAR ME?

21:44:31 >> Mayor Mei:   YES.

21:44:32 >> OKAY SORRY ABOUT THAT.

21:44:34 THE PROBLEM I HAVE IS AN ISSUE 

21:44:36 WITH THE ACCURACY OF THE 

21:44:37 GUIDANCE THAT YOU'RE BEING 

21:44:40 PRESENTED WITH.

21:44:43 YOU ARE NOT TARGETING ONLY 

21:44:45 AT-RISK AREAS AND NOW YOU ARE 

21:44:47 LUMPING DRASTIC CHANGES UNDER 

21:44:48 PAVEMENT MAINTENANCE.

21:44:50 SO HOW ACCOUNT CLAIMS BE MADE 

21:44:51 THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY SAFER BY 

21:44:53 THESE CHANGES?

21:44:55 IT'S VERY CLEAR YOU WILL SQUEEZE 

21:44:57 OUT AUTOS, WHEREVER AND WHENEVER 

21:44:58 YOU WANT.

21:45:00 AND THE MORE DIFFICULT IT GETS 

21:45:02 FOR PEOPLE TO COME IN OR GO 

21:45:05 ACROSS TOWN, PEOPLE AREN'T GOING 

21:45:08 TO SHOP OR EAT OR VISIT FREMONT.

21:45:10 WE'RE BRINGING MORE PEOPLE IN, 

21:45:11 MORE CARS.

21:45:12 IT WILL BE A MESS.

21:45:15 HOUSE ABOUT SPEED LIMITS, HIGHER 

21:45:19 POLICE PRESENCE, BRIGHTER NEWER 

21:45:21 STRIPES AND SIGNS, SAFER 

21:45:22 CROSSING AND BETTER LIGHTING?

21:45:24 I THINK THAT WOULD BE A MORE 

21:45:28 REASONABLE AND MORE EFFECTIVE 

21:45:31 SAFE OR THE ALL OF US, THANK 

21:45:33 YOU.

21:45:35 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

21:45:44 NEXT SPEAKER IS SUSHIL SHAKOLA.

21:45:48 >> HI, I SUPPORT OPTION 2 AND 

21:45:49 SAFETY PUNCH FOR THAT.

21:45:51 I'M A BIKER MYSELF, I LIKE TO DO 

21:45:53 THE BIKING.

21:45:55 WHEN I DO THE FUN BIKING I DO IT 

21:45:57 ON THE BIKE TRAILS WHICH IS LOT 

21:46:00 MORE 71 AND WHEN I GO POINT A TO 

21:46:03 POINT B I PREFER TO GO ON THE 

21:46:04 SIDE STREETS NOT THE MAIN 

21:46:04 STREETS.

21:46:06 THAT IS A MUCH SAFER PLACE TO 

21:46:06 BIKE.

21:46:09 AND ONE POINT THAT WAS MENTIONED 

21:46:11 IS ABOUT THE SPEEDING ON THAT TO 

21:46:13 REDUCE THE SPEEDING FOR THAT.

21:46:17 THE BETTER WAY TO DO IS TO 

21:46:18 EITHER THE CAMERA OR THE COPS 

21:46:20 THEY GIVE PEOPLE THE TICKET TO 

21:46:22 FINISH THEM SO THAT PEOPLE DO 

21:46:24 NOT VIOLATE THE SPEED LIMITS AND 

21:46:26 ALSO MAYBE TO PUT THE SPEED 

21:46:28 BUMPS THERE TO REDUCE THEIR 

21:46:28 SPEED.

21:46:31 WE ARE -- I SUPPORT THE OPTION 

21:46:31 2.

21:46:33 THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SAY, THANK 

21:46:35 YOU.

21:46:36 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

21:46:38 NEXT SPEAKER IS JOHN HINES.

21:46:38 WELCOME.

21:46:46 >> HELLO EVERYONE.

21:46:48 IN SEPTEMBER THE COUNCIL ROTED 

21:46:51 NOT TO REMOVE ANY CAR LANES FROM 

21:46:51 THIS STRETCH.

21:46:53 SINCE THEN WE HAVE EXACTLY ONE 

21:46:54 NEW FACT.

21:46:55 A SURVEYS WITH A BIG RESPONSE 

21:46:57 SHOWING A PREFERENCE NOT TO 

21:46:58 REMOVE CAR LANES.

21:46:59 THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH THE LAST 

21:47:00 COUNCIL VOTE.

21:47:02 THERE IS AN INTERESTING ITEM ON 

21:47:04 THE CITY'S WEB PAGE FOR THIS 

21:47:06 PROJECT IN THE Q&A SECTION.

21:47:09 THE QUESTION WAS WHY CYCLISTS 

21:47:10 CAN'T JUST TRAVEL ON 

21:47:12 NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS INSTEAD OF 

21:47:14 ARTERIALS LIKE PASEO.

21:47:16 AND THE ANSWER GIVEN WAS THAT 

21:47:18 THERE AREN'T ANY GOOD ALTERNATE 

21:47:19 ROUTES IN THAT PART OF UP TO.

21:47:22 WELL THAT APPLIES TO CARS, TOO.

21:47:24 NOW LOOK AHEAD TO ALL THE NEW 

21:47:25 RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT THAT'S 

21:47:27 PLANNED FOR IRVINGTON AND WARM 

21:47:28 SPRINGS.

21:47:30 THAT'S GOING TO PUT MORE STRAIN 

21:47:32 ON OUR ROAD CAPACITY NOT LESS.

21:47:34 THIS IS NOT A GOOD TIME TO BE 

21:47:37 REDUCING CRITICAL TRANSPORTATION 

21:47:39 INFRASTRUCTURE AND REPURPOSING 

21:47:40 IT TO RECREATIONAL USE.

21:47:41 THANK YOU.

21:47:46 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

21:47:50 THE NEXT SPEAKER IS FRANK 

21:47:51 PONCIANO.

21:47:52 WELCOME FRANK.

21:47:55 >> THANK YOU MAYOR.

21:48:01 I AM (INAUDIBLE).

21:48:03 >> Mayor Mei:   MY APOLOGIES 

21:48:04 FRANK, I'M HAVING SOME TROUBLE 

21:48:06 HEARING YOU.

21:48:07 >> OH ARE YOU ABLE TO HEAR ME 

21:48:08 NOW?

21:48:09 >> Mayor Mei:   YES.

21:48:10 >> OKAY.

21:48:11 THANK YOU MAYOR.

21:48:14 I JUST MOVED INTO THE -- TO 

21:48:14 FREMONT.

21:48:16 A MONTH AGO.

21:48:18 AND WE'RE COMING THERE SAN JOSE, 

21:48:20 MY WIFE AND I, AND WE CONSIDERED 

21:48:22 ALL KINDS OF PLACES ALL OVER THE 

21:48:23 BAY AREA INCLUDING SAN FRANCISCO 

21:48:25 AND OAKLAND.

21:48:28 AND THERE JUST SIMPLY ISN'T A 

21:48:30 TOWN ALL OVER THE BAY AREA THAT 

21:48:35 HAS MORE OF A WORLD CLASS BIKE 

21:48:36 AND PEDESTRIAN INFRASTRUCTURE 

21:48:39 THAN DOES FREMONT IN THE 

21:48:41 DOWNTOWN AREA.

21:48:42 AND SO I WANT TO CONGRATULATE 

21:48:43 ALL OF YOU FOR THAT.

21:48:47 THAT IS A HUGE DEAL AND IT IS, 

21:48:48 IT REMINDS ME OF EUROPEAN 

21:48:49 INFRASTRUCTURE.

21:48:51 WE NEED MORE OF THAT.

21:48:52 SINCE I'VE MOVED HERE AND I DO 

21:48:55 HAVE A VEHICLE, I USED TO DRIVE 

21:48:56 FOR TWO HOURS AT LEAST EVERY DAY 

21:48:58 WHEN I LIVED IN SAN JOSE.

21:48:59 I HAVEN'T TOUCHED THAT THING IN 

21:49:01 WEEKS AND I AM SO HAPPY.

21:49:03 AND I WANT THAT FOR EVERYBODY 

21:49:04 HERE.

21:49:07 TO BE HONEST.

21:49:09 YOU KNOW, IT SEEMS THAT IT IS 

21:49:10 GOING TO BE A PROBLEM IN THE 

21:49:14 SHORT TERM BUT REALLY, WE WANT 

21:49:15 TO THINK TOWARDS THE FUTURE 

21:49:17 BECAUSE WE NEED LESS VEHICLES ON 

21:49:18 THE ROAD.

21:49:20 AIR POLLUTION IS A HUGE PROBLEM.

21:49:23 SAFETY IS A HOOUNL PROBLEM.

21:49:25 CLIMATE CHANGE IS A HUGE 

21:49:25 PROBLEM.

21:49:28 AND A LITTLE TRAFFIC SEEMS TO ME 

21:49:30 VERY LITTLE COST IN ORDER FOR US 

21:49:32 TO MOVE FORWARD ON ALL OF THOSE 

21:49:34 ISSUES.

21:49:35 THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

21:49:37 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

21:49:40 NEXT SPEAKER IS DAVE CAMPBELL.

21:49:42 WELCOME DAVE.

21:49:43 >> GOOD EVENING, MAYOR AND 

21:49:46 COUNCILMEMBERS, DAVE CAMPBELL.

21:49:50 ICE DIRECTOR BIKE EAST BAY.

21:49:51 I WANT TO GIVE YOU MY 

21:49:52 PERSPECTIVE HERE.

21:49:54 I DON'T LIVE IN FREMONT BUT I'M 

21:49:56 THE ADVOCACY DIRECTOR WITH 33 

21:49:59 CITIES FOR BIKE EAST BAY, 

21:49:59 INCLUDING FREMONT.

21:50:01 I DO AGREE WITH THE PREVIOUS 

21:50:02 SPEAKER THAT FREMONT IS A 

21:50:05 LEADING CITY IN MANY WAYS LET'S 

21:50:07 KEEP IT THIS WAY BUT THIS 

21:50:09 PROJECT IS A SAFETY PROJECT NOT 

21:50:10 A BIKE LANE PROJECT.

21:50:13 HOW DO WE SQUEEZE THE BIKE LANES 

21:50:15 IN, HOW CAN WE MAKE EVERYBODY 

21:50:17 HAPPY, CAN WE NARROW THE LANES 

21:50:18 HERE AND THERE CAN WE DO THIS 

21:50:20 CAN WE DO THAT.

21:50:23 OPTIONS 2 AND 3 TO DO THAT IS 

21:50:25 ONLY A GOOD THING TO BRING THIS 

21:50:27 BACK TO COUNCIL IN FOUR TO SIX 

21:50:29 MONTHS AND HAVE TO ADDRESS THIS 

21:50:32 ISSUE YET AGAIN IF YOU SOLVE THE 

21:50:33 PROBLEM WITH JUST PAINT.

21:50:35 THAT'S WHY OPTION 1 IS THE 

21:50:36 SAFETY OPTION AND IF YOU DO THAT 

21:50:38 YOU MIGHT NOT HAVE TO BRING THIS 

21:50:39 BACK TO COUNCIL AGAIN.

21:50:41 STAFF CAN TAKE THAT ROAD DIET 

21:50:42 AND THE OTHER OPTIONS AND MAKE 

21:50:44 THIS A SAFE STREET.

21:50:47 I KNOW THE MAYOR HAS BEEN AT THE 

21:50:51 ALAMEDA COUNTY CTC MEETINGS, 

21:50:53 WHERE SAFETY HAS BEEN GOING 

21:50:54 DOWN, WE HEARD THIS BEFORE THE 

21:50:56 PANDEMIC, YOU HEARD IT DURING 

21:50:57 THE PANDEMIC, THE DIRECTOR JUST 

21:50:59 GAVE YOU THE UPDATE AND YOU'RE 

21:51:02 PROVIDING LEADERSHIP AT THE 

21:51:03 COUNTY LEVEL TO BRING SAFETY 

21:51:05 THROUGHOUT THE COUNTY AND NOW 

21:51:07 YOU'RE BACK AT FREMONT CITY 

21:51:09 COUNCIL, THAT LEADERSHIP NEEDS 

21:51:12 TO CONTINUE AND OPTION 1 IS THE 

21:51:14 ONLY SAFE OPTION.

21:51:15 HERE IT CAN HAPPEN BECAUSE IT'S 

21:51:17 NOT GOING TO CAUSE CONGESTION 

21:51:18 EITHER.

21:51:19 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

21:51:20 I JUST WANTED TO NOTE PEOPLE 

21:51:22 THAT IF YOU'VE ALREADY SPOKEN 

21:51:24 YOU CAN'T SPEAK TWICE.

21:51:25 I DON'T KNOW I'M JUST CHECKING 

21:51:27 TO MAKE SURE THAT THE HANDS ARE 

21:51:29 ALL NEW SPEAKERS FOR THIS ITEM.

21:51:35 SO NEXT SPEAKER IS A. J. IRE.

21:51:41 WELCOME A.J.

21:51:45 >> OKAY, CAN YOU HEAR ME WELL?

21:51:46 >> Mayor Mei:   YES.

21:51:49 >> SO I STRONGLY OPPOSE ROAD 

21:51:50 DIET.

21:51:52 I DON'T THINK IT'S SERVING ANY 

21:51:54 PURPOSE OTHER THAN CAUSING MORE 

21:51:56 STRESS ON DRIVERS AND IN FACT 

21:51:58 CAUSING UNSAFE CONDITIONS ON 

21:52:01 FREMONT AND OTHER STREETS WHERE 

21:52:03 THEY REDUCE THE LANE SIZE.

21:52:05 I'M ALSO AGAINST REDUCING THE 

21:52:07 LANES IN PASEO PADRE TO ONE 

21:52:08 LANE.

21:52:10 IT IS ABSOLUTELY UTTER CHAOS 

21:52:12 SITUATION WILL PREVAIL.

21:52:13 FIVE SCHOOLS IN THE AREA, THE 

21:52:15 TRAFFIC CONDITIONS WOULD BECOME 

21:52:16 MUCH WORSE.

21:52:17 ALREADY THE CONGESTION THAT HAS 

21:52:21 BEEN CREATED ON DRISCOLL AND 

21:52:23 WASHINGTON DUE TO THE REMOVAL OF 

21:52:25 RIGHT HAND LANES HAVE BEEN 

21:52:28 CAUSING HAVOC ON THE AREA EVERY 

21:52:31 MORNING AND EVERY EVENING.

21:52:32 I WANT TO MAKE SURE THE CITY 

21:52:38 COUNCIL IS NOTING.

21:52:40 THESE CHANGES MAY OR MAY NOT 

21:52:43 MAKE IT SAFE IN THE LONG TERM.

21:52:46 YOU MIGHT HAVE I WOULD SAY 

21:52:48 OPTION 3 ADD A SNAM NO BIKES 

21:52:52 LANE, NO ROAD DIET AND THE 

21:52:53 CONCREATES ON DRISCOLL AND 

21:52:54 WASHINGTON THANK YOU.

21:52:58 >> Mayor Mei:   NEXT SPEAKER IS 

21:52:59 JASON.

21:53:05 >> HELLO HI.

21:53:07 GOOD EVENING, EVERYONE.

21:53:09 I'M A LOCAL RESIDENT.

21:53:14 I USE PASEO PADRE PARKWAY EVERY 

21:53:15 DAY.

21:53:20 I LIKE FREMONT BUT I DO CONSTANT 

21:53:23 FREMONT TRAFFIC AND NOW 

21:53:25 BASICALLY I'M AGAINST THE SINGLE 

21:53:28 ONE, THAT'S THE WORST IDEA.

21:53:30 THE GENTLEMAN'S SIDE HE'S A 

21:53:32 SURPRISED LOCAL RESIDENTS EVEN 

21:53:33 ON PASEO PADRE, DO NOT SUPPORT 

21:53:36 HIS IDEA TO USE SINGLE LANE.

21:53:39 YOU KNOW WHY THE PEOPLE HERE ARE 

21:53:41 SMARTER FOR SURE.

21:53:45 THE SINGLE LANE IS, OUR 

21:53:46 SITUATION COULD BE WORSE, IT'S 

21:53:48 JAMMED, IF THERE IS TRAFFIC 

21:53:53 PROBLEMS, SO NO FIREFIGHTERS ON 

21:53:56 PASEO PADRE COULD GET AROUND, TO 

21:53:56 WALK AROUND.

21:53:58 ALSO THE GITION WOULD BE 

21:54:01 SUPPLIED TO THE LOCAL ZONE IS IF 

21:54:02 IT'S JAMMED.

21:54:05 I DEFINITELY THAT WILL BE BE THE 

21:54:06 WORST IDEA.

21:54:08 I DON'T KNOW IF WE HAVE OTHER 

21:54:08 OPTIONS.

21:54:10 IF WE DO NOT HAVE OPTION 2 WOULD 

21:54:11 BE BETTER.

21:54:13 WE DON'T HAVE PERFECT SOLUTION.

21:54:15 SOMETIMES WE HAVE TO TAKE THE 

21:54:17 TRADEOFF BETWEEN SAFETY AND THE 

21:54:20 COMING YEARS, SOLUTION 2 SO FAR 

21:54:21 IS THE BEST CHOICE TO US.

21:54:23 THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THIS 

21:54:24 TOPIC.

21:54:24 BYE.

21:54:27 >> Mayor Mei:   NEXT SPEAKER IT 

21:54:28 WILL BE KEITH.

21:54:37 >> SO I'M HERE TO SPEAK AGAINST 

21:54:39 THE ELIMINATION OF LANES ON 

21:54:41 PASEO PADRE, SOMETHING THE 

21:54:42 OVERWHELMING NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN 

21:54:44 FREMONT WHETHER ON YOUR SURVEY 

21:54:46 ON THE ONLINE FORM SUCH AS NEXT 

21:54:49 DOOR OR PATCH REALLY ANYWHERE 

21:54:50 ELSE YOU LOOK DO NOT WANT.

21:54:52 THE SOLUTION TO SPEEDING IS NOT 

21:54:58 TO RECONFIGURE OUR ROADS, CITY 

21:55:00 OF FREMONT HAS TRIED REMOVING 

21:55:03 LANES IN OTHER PLACES AND SEEN 

21:55:05 PREDICTABILITY RESULTS, 

21:55:06 ESSENTIALLY MAKING THE ROADS 

21:55:07 UNUSABLE.

21:55:09 IT DIDN'T WORK BEFORE, WILDLY 

21:55:11 UNPOPULAR AND HAD TO BE UNDONE.

21:55:12 NOW WE'RE CONSIDERING DOING THE 

21:55:14 SAME THING AGAIN AND EXPECTING 

21:55:16 THE SAME OUTCOME.

21:55:21 I'M SURE YOU REMEMBER THE OLD 

21:55:22 SAYING, THAT BEING THE 

21:55:24 DEFINITION OF INSANITY.

21:55:25 THIS IS INSANE.

21:55:26 THIS IS SOMETHING THE PEOPLE OF 

21:55:27 FREMONT DO NOT WANT.

21:55:29 THE RESULTS OF YOUR SURVEY ARE 

21:55:31 CLEAR, THE PEOPLE DO NOT WANT 

21:55:33 THIS SO I HAVE TO WONDER WHY ARE 

21:55:35 WE REALLY EVEN DISCUSSING THIS?

21:55:37 IS IT MEANT TO ENHANCE SAFETY?

21:55:39 HANS SPOKE ABOUT HISTORICAL 

21:55:41 ACCIDENTS BUT SINCE THE CHANGES 

21:55:43 WERE MADE WHICH ALREADY INCLUDED 

21:55:45 THE NARROWING OF LANES AND THE 

21:55:46 ADDITION OF EQUITY PFERGHTLY 

21:55:48 SAFE AND EFFECTIVE BIKE LANE, 

21:55:51 THE KIND OF BIKE LANE I SAFELY 

21:55:53 ROAD IN IT FOR YEARS, WHEN I 

21:55:56 COMMUTED TO WORK WITH MY BIKE.

21:55:58 THERE SHOULD BE ZERO ACCIDENTS, 

21:56:01 ZERO, SO I HAVE TO ASK HOW FAR 

21:56:02 BELOW ZERO DO YOU WANT THE 

21:56:03 NUMBER TO GO?

21:56:06 THE CLEAR VICTORY AND LET'S MOVE 

21:56:07 ON WITHOUT WASTING MORE 

21:56:09 RESOURCES.

21:56:11 >> Mayor Mei:   NEXT SPEAKER IS 

21:56:12 BLAIR BEEKMAN.

21:56:15 >> HI, THANK YOU.

21:56:17 THANKS FOR ALLOWING PUBLIC 

21:56:19 COMMENT ON THIS ITEM.

21:56:25 I'M MORE IN THE CAMP OF HOW THE 

21:56:28 FUTURE OF ROAD LANES CAN HAVE A 

21:56:30 FEW SIMPLE LANES FOR EASY ACCESS 

21:56:32 TO FREEWAYS AND THE REMAINDER 

21:56:34 SHOULD BE AVAILABLE FOR BICYCLES 

21:56:36 AND PEOPLE AND PEDESTRIANS.

21:56:37 GOOD LUCK IN THAT EFFORT.

21:56:40 YOU KNOW I TEND TO TRY TO WORK 

21:56:41 TOWARDS MORE OF THE TECHNOLOGY 

21:56:43 AND THE VISION ZERO PRACTICES 

21:56:45 THAT WILL BE INVOLVED IN THE 

21:56:47 FUTURE OF ROAD BUILDING.

21:56:49 AND, YOU KNOW, FROM THE PREVIOUS 

21:56:51 ITEM THE IDEAS OF OPENNESS AND 

21:56:53 ACCOUNTABILITY, MINIMAL 

21:56:56 PRACTICES WITH TECHNOLOGY USE, 

21:56:58 AND A REAL FOCUS ON THE IDEAS OF 

21:57:02 CIVIL PROTECTIONS AS HOW TO HELP 

21:57:03 REALLY GUIDE THE QUESTIONS WE 

21:57:05 ASK ABOUT THE FUTURE OF VISION 

21:57:10 ZERO, AND THESE SORT OF ROAD 

21:57:11 PROJECTS, IT'S IMPORTANT FOR 

21:57:12 MYSELF.

21:57:13 AND THAT'S WHERE I COME FROM AND 

21:57:16 IT'S PART OF THE PROCESS OF 

21:57:18 CONSIDERING HOW TO END WAR, 

21:57:20 BASICALLY, AND I'M BETTER 

21:57:21 UNDERSTANDING WHAT YOU ARE 

21:57:23 TRYING TO GO FOR IN THE PREVIOUS 

21:57:25 ITEM, YOU KNOW, TO LABEL THINGS 

21:57:27 AS MILITARY, THAT'S A BIG STEP 

21:57:28 FORWARD.

21:57:30 WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO DO THAT.

21:57:32 IT TAKES PRACTICE TO LEARN HOW 

21:57:33 TO DO THAT.

21:57:35 IT TAKES FRACTS TO LEARN THESE 

21:57:37 SORT OF GLIEPS THAT OPENNESS AND 

21:57:38 ACCOUNTABILITY CAN OFFER AND 

21:57:39 HELP WITH.

21:57:42 IT TAKES PRACTICE FOR ALL OF US 

21:57:44 TO LEARN HOW TO DO THAT.

21:57:46 GOOD LUCK WITH THE COMMUNITY 

21:57:47 PROCESS.

21:57:48 THANK YOU.

21:57:50 >> Mayor Mei:   HENRY, WELCOME.

21:57:56 >> GOOD EVENING, MADAM MAYOR, MY 

21:58:01 NAME IS HENRY LEUNG.

21:58:03 MR. LARSON'S PRESENTATION, I 

21:58:04 THINK THERE IS A MAJOR FLAW 

21:58:04 HERE.

21:58:09 THE PRESENTATION RELY ON THE 

21:58:14 AVERAGE DAILY.

21:58:16 THE AVERAGE WAS BILL GATES THE 

21:58:19 NUMBER IS PRETTY IMPRESSIVE.

21:58:20 PROBABLY 60 BILLION.

21:58:22 SO THE AVERAGE DIDN'T TELL THE 

21:58:24 WHOLE PICTURE, BASIC, PEAK 

21:58:24 TRAFFIC.

21:58:28 WE OUGHT TO BE KEEPING IN MIND 

21:58:31 BASICALLY PEOPLE'S 

21:58:31 PSYCHOLOGICAL.

21:58:36 IF HE DRIES 680 IT'S OBVIOUSLY A 

21:58:37 LESSON.

21:58:38 WHEN YOU HAVE A TRIAL IN THE 

21:58:41 PEAK HOUR, PASEO PADRE, WHAT ARE 

21:58:44 WE TO DO, YOU KNOW, THE PEOPLE 

21:58:46 NOW THREE SECOND JUST LIKE THEY 

21:58:48 DON'T FOLLOW THREE SECOND RULE.

21:58:50 OVERFLOW TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

21:58:52 MAKE OUR NEIGHBORHOOD EVEN 

21:58:52 WORSE.

21:58:55 AND I THINK THE OPTION 2 IS 

21:58:58 ACTUALLY AS GOOD AN OPTION, 

21:58:59 ACTUALLY CONSIDER BOTH AS SAFETY 

21:59:02 AND ALSO THE TRAFFIC.

21:59:06 GIVE ME 9,000 VEHICLE PER DAY IS 

21:59:09 NOT A SMALL NUMBER.

21:59:13 WE'RE IN THE INDUSTRY, IN THE 

21:59:15  

21:59:17 PANDEMIC, HOPKINS MIDDLE SCHOOL 

21:59:20 IS NOT EVEN OPEN YET.

21:59:21 THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.

21:59:23 >> Mayor Mei:   NEXT SPEAKER IS 

21:59:23 PAT.

21:59:32 >> HI, MY NAME IS PAT WILSON, A 

21:59:34 FREMONT RESIDENT.

21:59:36 HOWEVER VOTE AGAINST ROAD DIET 

21:59:36 ON PASEO PADRE.

21:59:39 IF YOU ARE THINKING THE EXTRA 

21:59:42 LANES ON 680 ELIMINATES TRAFFIC 

21:59:43 JAM THINK AGAIN.

21:59:46 I USE 680 AND DAILY BASIS THERE 

21:59:47 ARE ALREADY TWO TIMES SINCE 

21:59:50 APRIL 1st, GOOGLE MAPS 

21:59:52 DIRECTED ME TO GET OFF OF 680 

21:59:53 AND USE LOCAL ROAD.

21:59:55 THIS WORK FOR HOME IS STILL IN 

21:59:57 EFFECT FOR LOTS OF PEOPLE.

21:59:59 THE TRAFFIC ON 680 WILL BE BACK 

22:00:02 SOON WITH ALL THE HIGH DENSITY 

22:00:04 IN FREMONT AND OTHER PLACES.

22:00:06 ROAD DIET ON PASEO PADRE WILL 

22:00:07 MAKE THE TRANSPORTATION A 

22:00:09 NIGHTMARE FOR LOCAL RESIDENTS.

22:00:11 PLEASE DON'T LET THIS HAPPEN.

22:00:13 YOU AS ELECTED OFFICIALS SHOULD 

22:00:15 LIN TO THE VOTERS AND ACT TO 

22:00:18 SERVE THEIR NEEDS NOT TO FORCE 

22:00:22 YOUR IDEOLOGY ON RESIDENTS.

22:00:24 PLEASE USE THE FEEDBACK YOU GOT 

22:00:25 FROM THE SURVEY.

22:00:26 THE SAFETY ISSUE PEOPLE 

22:00:28 CONCERNED ABOUT ARE CAUSED BY 

22:00:29 PEOPLE WHO BREAK THE LAW.

22:00:31 WHY SHOULD WE PENALIZE THOSE, 

22:00:34 BECAUSE OF THOSE OUTLAWS?

22:00:36 TO BEST HELP AND IMPROVE SAFETY, 

22:00:38 THE BEST SOLUTION IS TO IMPROVE 

22:00:39 YOUR LAW ENFORCEMENT ON SPEED 

22:00:42 LIMIT NOT TO HIN DIR PEOPLE'S 

22:00:43 TRANSPORTATION RIGHT.

22:00:44 THANK YOU.

22:00:46 >> Mayor Mei:   NEXT SPEAKER IS 

22:00:50 MANJANT SANCAR.

22:00:51 >> GOOD EVENING, RESPECTED 

22:00:52 MEMBERS.

22:00:54 AS A RESIDENT LIVING ON PASEO 

22:00:57 PADRE PARKWAY I SPEAK IN 

22:00:58 DISAPPROVAL OF THE PROPOSED LAIN 

22:00:59 DIET.

22:01:05 FIRSTLY MY CITY HAS A HOPE TO 

22:01:09 KEEP EVERYONE SAFE ON THE ROAD.

22:01:10 THESE ISSUES CAN ARE DISCUSSED 

22:01:13 DEBATED, I'M COMPLETELY ALINED 

22:01:14 WITH THE INVIGORATES AND THE 

22:01:16 STATED PROBLEMS AND SOLUTIONS 

22:01:18 BUT RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE WITH 

22:01:19 THE LANE CHANGES.

22:01:22 SECONDLY, THE SURVEY RESULTS 

22:01:25 INDICATE 28 PEOPLE LIVING ON 

22:01:30 PASEO PADRE, PREFER LANE 

22:01:30 CHANGES.

22:01:33 THERE HAVE BEEN APPEARS LARGER 

22:01:34 THAN REALITY AND HIDES THE FACT 

22:01:35 THAT THESE CHANGES CAUSE MORE 

22:01:36 HARM.

22:01:39 LASTLY NOT ONLY ARE THESE BIKE 

22:01:41 LANES UNDERUTILIZED THEY HAVE 

22:01:42 BEEN HERE LONGER ELSEWHERE IN 

22:01:44 FREMONT TO VIOLATE THE SAFETY 

22:01:47 THAT WE SEEK TO ACHIEVE.

22:01:49 DATA FROM OTHER CITIES AND 

22:01:54 MOVING GOAL POSTS ARBITRARY AND 

22:01:55 IMPACT ON THE COMMUNITY.

22:01:56 THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY.

22:01:58 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

22:01:59 NEXT SPEAKER IS RK.

22:02:10 >> HI, MY NAME IS RAMESH.

22:02:13 WE LIVE FIVE BLOCKS AWAY FROM 

22:02:15 THE PROPOSED STRETCH OF PASEO 

22:02:16 PADRE AT DRISCOLL.

22:02:17 WE USE THAT ROADWAY SEVERAL 

22:02:19 TIMES A DAY DROPPING KIDS TO 

22:02:22 SCHOOL OR AT THEIR OTHER 

22:02:24 ATHLETIC, OTHER ACTIVITIES OR 

22:02:26 COMMUTING VIA 680.

22:02:28 SAFETY IS UTMOST IMPORTANT TO 

22:02:30 ALL OF US, AND WE HAVE LIVED 

22:02:33 HERE 18 YEARS.

22:02:35 2013 IS THE ONLY YEAR I RECALL 

22:02:37 ON THIS STRETCH THERE WAS A 

22:02:38 FATAL ACCIDENT.

22:02:41 THIS STRETCH IS REASONABLY SAFE.

22:02:44 PASEO PADRE IS 12 TO 18 MILES 

22:02:44 LONG.

22:02:47 I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR FROM THE 

22:02:48 PUBLIC WORKS DEPARTMENT WHAT IS 

22:02:51 THE AVERAGE OVER SPEED LIMIT 

22:02:53 TRAVEL ON PASEO PADRE ON THE 

22:02:57 ENTIRE 12 OR 15-MILE STRETCH.

22:03:00 ROAD DIET IN THIS STRETCH DOES 

22:03:01 NOT SUPPORT THE COMMUNITY, DOES 

22:03:03 NOT SUPPORT THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

22:03:05 SO LET'S NOT FORCE IT DOWN THE 

22:03:07 THROAT.

22:03:08 SURVEY HAS SPOKEN.

22:03:10 COMMUNITY HAS SPOKEN.

22:03:15 I'M ALSO SURPRISED THAT THE 

22:03:17 50-50 SPLIT BETWEEN THE PASEO 

22:03:20 PADRE RESIDENTS IS -- COULD BE 

22:03:21 MISLEAD BEING.

22:03:23 IT WOULD BE GREAT TO KNOW IS IT 

22:03:27 49-51 OR 45-50?

22:03:34 MY SENSE IS IT'S 50 OPPOSED, 50 

22:03:36 SUPPORT, 45 UNDECIDED.

22:03:37 THANK YOU.

22:03:38 >> Mayor Mei:   NEXT SPEAKER IS 

22:03:41 DILET MODI.

22:03:43 I'M GOING TO WARN YOU WE ARE 

22:03:45 ALMOST HEADED TO ANOTHER BREAK 

22:03:45 AGAIN.

22:03:47 >> HI, CAN YOU HEAR ME?

22:03:48 >> Mayor Mei:   YES.

22:03:51 >> YES SO I'VE BEEN LIVING IN 

22:03:54 FREMONT FOR 35 PLUS YEARS AND 

22:03:55 ANYONE WHO DOESN'T WORRY ABOUT 

22:03:58 THE BIKE SAFETY MOST PROBABLY 

22:04:01 HAS NOT BIKED ON PASEO PADRE 

22:04:06 WITH THE CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION, 

22:04:06 INTERIM IMPLEMENTATION.

22:04:09 I DO BIKE AND I FEEL EXTREMELY 

22:04:12 UNSAFE WITH THE SCARS ZOOMING 

22:04:16  CARS ZOOMING BY 

22:04:18 WITH THAT NARROW LANE.

22:04:21 FIRST OF ALL I DO WANT TO THANK 

22:04:23 HANS LARSEN FOR DETAILED 

22:04:25 ANALYSIS AND DATA AND I THINK 

22:04:28 LIKE PREVIOUS SPEAKER SAID, IT'S 

22:04:30 PEOPLE'S OWN PERCEPTION.

22:04:33 BUT THE DATA THAT HANS LARSEN 

22:04:34 HAS PRESENTED IS COMPREHENSIVE, 

22:04:37 GIVES THE LOGIC AND THEREFORE I 

22:04:40 STRONGLY SUPPORT DIET.

22:04:41 IT'S SAFETY COMES FIRST.

22:04:44 IF PEOPLE FEEL INCONVENIENCED, 

22:04:46 IF THEY ARE LATE BY 30 SECONDS 

22:04:47 WHICH IS THE PERCEPTION I DON'T 

22:04:50 THINK THAT OUTWEIGHS THE LIFE 

22:04:51 AND SAFETY OF SOMEONE ON A BIKE 

22:04:53 GETTING HURT.

22:04:55 AT 35 MILES AN HOUR A BIKE 

22:04:56 GETTING HIT BY A CAR THERE'S NO 

22:04:58 CHANCE FOR THAT PERSON.

22:05:00 THANK YOU.

22:05:01 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

22:05:08 NEXT SPEAKER IS STEVE SCALA.

22:05:19 >> HI, THANK YOU MADAM MAYOR, 

22:05:19 CITY COUNCIL.

22:05:20 COUPLE OF POINTS.

22:05:23 ONE THIS IS NOT A BICYCLE ISSUE, 

22:05:24 IT IS A SAFETY ISSUE.

22:05:26 IF YOU LOOK AT THE DATA FROM 

22:05:27 STAFF MOST OF THE CRASH DATA IS 

22:05:28 CAR ON CAR.

22:05:30 IF YOU LOOK AT THEIR SPEED DATA 

22:05:33 THEY TOOK 12 MEASUREMENTS IN 

22:05:36 MARCH, SEPARATED BY HOUR.

22:05:38 IF YOU LOOK AT THE 8 A.M. SCHOOL 

22:05:40 DROPOFF TIMES, TEN OF THOSE 12 

22:05:42 TIMES THEY RECORDED SPEEDS IN 

22:05:45 EXCESS OF 55 MILES AN HOUR.

22:05:48 THE MAIN SAFETY ISSUE IS GOING 

22:05:49 TO BE SOMEBODY GOING TO SCHOOL 

22:05:51 AND A THIRD GRADER IN THE BACK 

22:05:55 SEAT OF A CAR GETTING T BONED 

22:05:57 GOING 55 MPH.

22:05:59 THOSE SPEEDS ARE NOT GOING TO 

22:06:00 REDUCE SIGNIFICANTLY WITHOUT THE 

22:06:01 ROAD DIET.

22:06:03 THE TRAFFIC PROFESSIONALS PAST 

22:06:05 AND PRESENT HAVE SAID THAT.

22:06:08 AS FAR AS CONGESTION, AGAIN, THE 

22:06:09 TRAFFIC PROFESSIONALS ARE 

22:06:11 SAYING, CONGESTION IS NOT AN 

22:06:12 ISSUE.

22:06:13 THAT'S BECAUSE CONGESTION IS AT 

22:06:15 THE BACKUPS.

22:06:17 THE INTERSECTION OF DRISCOLL AND 

22:06:17 WASHINGTON.

22:06:19 THOSE DON'T CHANGE.

22:06:21 THE ONLY THING THAT CHANGES THE 

22:06:23 VERY MIDDLE SECTION, EVERYTHING 

22:06:28 REMAINS FOUR LANES, WHERE THE 

22:06:29 BACKUP POINTS ARE.

22:06:32 IT'S MUCH LIKE PASEO PADRE SOUTH 

22:06:35 OF WASHINGTON, OR SPIN ONE LANE 

22:06:37 AND THERE'S NO CONGESTION THERE.

22:06:38 SO CONGESTION REALLY ISN'T A 

22:06:39 CONCERN.

22:06:41 I HOPE THAT YOU CHOOSE OPTION 1 

22:06:43 AND CHOOSE SAFETY OVER THE 

22:06:45 PERCEPTIONS OF CONGESTIONS, 

22:06:46 WHICH DON'T EXIST.

22:06:55 THANK YOU.

22:06:57 >> Mayor Mei:   NEXT SPEAKER IS 

22:07:04 MANGELA PEDIREDI.

22:07:06 >> HI CAN YOU HEAR ME?

22:07:08 >> Mayor Mei:   YES.

22:07:09 >> GOOD EVENING COUNCILMEMBERS.

22:07:11 I'M HERE TO SPEAK TO SUPPORT A 

22:07:12 ROAD DIET.

22:07:15 I'M A FAPPED RESIDENT I LIVE 

22:07:17 VERY CLOSE TO WASHINGTON AND 

22:07:18 PASEO PADRE INTERSECTION AND 

22:07:20 WE'VE BEEN HERE PAST TWO YEARS 

22:07:21 AND I'VE NEVER SEEN ANY 

22:07:23 CONDITION ON THIS ROAD BUT EVERY 

22:07:26 DAY I SEE HUNDREDS OF CARS 

22:07:27 SPEEDING ON THIS AND THEN ME 

22:07:30 BEING ON THE STRETCH OF THIS 

22:07:31 ROAD BACKING THE CAR FROM OUR 

22:07:33 DRIVEWAY IS A NIGHTMARE.

22:07:35 USUALLY I HOLD MY HEART IN MY 

22:07:37 HAND AND THEN I CAN BACK OUT AND 

22:07:39 I RECENTLY ALSO MET WITH AN 

22:07:40 ACCIDENT, EEN THOUGH WE ARE 

22:07:42 TRYING TO GO SLOWLY BUT BECAUSE 

22:07:44 OF THE ROAD STRUCTURE THE 

22:07:45 VISIBILITY IS SO POOR AND 

22:07:48 BACKING SO HARD.

22:07:50 SO AS MANY SPEAKERS ARE ALSO 

22:07:53 MENTION, THIS IS NOT REALLY 

22:07:53 RECREATIONAL THING.

22:07:55 I MEAN YOU KNOW IT IS BASICALLY 

22:07:57 A SAFETY CONCERN AND I THINK 

22:07:58 SAFETY SHOULD BE THE FIRST, AND 

22:08:00 IT SHOULD NOT CREATE ANY 

22:08:02 FRUSTRATED DRIVERS.

22:08:04 JUST PRIORITIZING AND THEN MAYBE 

22:08:06 STARTING FIVE MINUTES IERL FROM 

22:08:07 THE HOME TO REACH THE 

22:08:09 DESTINATION WOULD SOLVE THIS 

22:08:11 PROBLEM RATHER THAN BEING 

22:08:12 FRUSTRATED DRIVERS ON THE ROAD 

22:08:13 BECAUSE OF THE ROAD CONDITION.

22:08:16 BECAUSE OF MOVING TO SINGLE 

22:08:18 LANE, I DON'T THINK SO, THAT IS 

22:08:21 REALLY ANY CONCERN, BUT SAFETY 

22:08:23 SHOULD BE CONCERN FIRST PRIORITY 

22:08:28 AND THEN COUNCILMEMBERS SHOULD 

22:08:31 CONSIDER THEIR OPTION 1 FOR A 

22:08:32 ROAD DIET.

22:08:36 I THINK THAT THIS IS A BIT HIGH 

22:08:38 THING NOW CONCERNING NOW.

22:08:39 >> Mayor Mei:   NEXT SPEAKER IS 

22:08:45 ANDREAS CARVANOVICH.

22:08:47 WELCOME.

22:08:51 >> GOOD EVENING, ANDREAS 

22:08:55 CARVANOVICH WITH BIKE FREMONT.

22:08:57 IN THE SYSTEM WE HAVE KILLED 

22:09:00 35,000 A YEAR, IN FREMONT IT IS 

22:09:03 PRETTY CONSISTENTLY FOUR TO FIVE 

22:09:03 PEOPLE A YEAR.

22:09:05 SO THE CITY DECIDED BECAUSE 

22:09:06 WE'RE A COMPASSIONATE CITY WE'RE 

22:09:08 NOT GOING TO DO THAT ANYMORE.

22:09:09 WE'RE GOING TO GO FORWARD, WE'RE 

22:09:11 GOING TO FIX THIS, WE ARE GOING 

22:09:14 TO FIX THIS SYSTEMICALLY, WE ARE 

22:09:16 GOING TO FIX IT ANYWHERE WE HAVE 

22:09:18 A CHANCE, ANYWHERE WE GET A 

22:09:18 CHANCE.

22:09:21 THE CHANCE HERE IS TO DO THE 

22:09:22 ROAD DIET AS THE DATA SHOWS IT 

22:09:24 WILL HAVE NO IMPACT ON 

22:09:24 CONGESTION.

22:09:26 THERE IS A LOT OF CONJECTURE AND 

22:09:28 OPINION THE DATA HAS BEEN VERY 

22:09:30 CLEAR FOR LAST THREE YEARS AND 

22:09:31 ALL THE PROFESSIONALS AGREE ON 

22:09:31 THIS.

22:09:33 THERE IS NO CONGESTION PENALTY 

22:09:35 HERE IF YOU DO THE ROAD DIET.

22:09:37 THERE IS A VERY CLEAR SAFETY 

22:09:39 BENEFIT IN GOING FORWARD WITH 

22:09:41 THESE SYSTEMIC CHANGES.

22:09:44 PLEASE GO FORWARD WITH THE ROAD 

22:09:46 DIET HERE.

22:09:48 AND IT'S NOT LIKE YOU COULDN'T 

22:09:49 GO BACK.

22:09:50 IT'S STILL JUST PAINT.

22:09:53 IF FIVE, TEN YEARS FROM NOW YOU 

22:09:54 ACTUALLY DO FIND THERE'S 

22:09:57 CONGESTION FROM 680 THE NEXT 

22:09:58 RESTRIPING PROJECT COULD BE 

22:09:59 GETTING BACK TO TWO LANES.

22:10:02 THANK YOU.

22:10:03 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

22:10:09 THE NEXT SPEAKER IS KELLY ABREU.

22:10:11 WELCOME KELLY.

22:10:12 >> I AGREE WITH MR. HUGHES THE 

22:10:14 ROAD HAS A LOT OF SPEEDING, IT'S 

22:10:17 UNSAFE FOR BIKING AND RESIDENTS.

22:10:19 CUTTING DOWN FROM FOUR LANES TO 

22:10:21 TWO LANES ISN'T GOING TO HURT 

22:10:23 THE TRAFFIC FLOW, IT WILL HELP 

22:10:24 THE SAFETY.

22:10:27 THAT DOWN GRADE AT COVINGTON HAS 

22:10:28 LIMITED SITE DISTANCE BECAUSE OF 

22:10:29 THE TIGHT CURVE.

22:10:35 IT DOESN'T MEET THE STATE 

22:10:36 TRANSPORTATION DEPARTMENT 

22:10:41 REGULATIONS, IT MIGHT BE TO 

22:10:45 THROTTLE THE TRAFFIC, THAT'S 

22:10:48 DONE AS OSGOOD AND WASHINGTON, 

22:10:50 THAT MEDIAN IS VERY WIDE, CHOP 

22:10:53 IT DOWN TO HOW NARROW IT NEEDS 

22:10:54 TO BE.

22:10:56 GIVE YOURSELF MORE ROOM.

22:10:57 THE TRAFFIC IMPACTS ARE NOT 

22:10:59 POSTED ON THE WEBSITE FOR 2019 

22:11:00 AND 2021.

22:11:01 SO WE'RE NOT EXACTLY WHAT THE 

22:11:02 TRAFFIC COUNTS ARE.

22:11:05 I'M NOT A PRACTICING TRAFFIC 

22:11:05 ENGINEER.

22:11:08 BUT SINCE THE CITY LIKES TO USE 

22:11:10 POLLING DATA AND OPINION SURVEYS 

22:11:12 TO MAKE SAFETY DECISIONS, I'D 

22:11:15 ASK, WHY DON'T WE REPLACE ALL 

22:11:17 THESE TRAFFIC ENGINEERS WITH 

22:11:20 POLLSTERS, PETITIONS, STATUS 

22:11:21 CONTIGUOUS AND POLITICAL 

22:11:21 CONSULTANTS.

22:11:23 WE CAN GET RID OF ALL THESE 

22:11:25 EXPERTS AND GIVE POWER DIRECTLY 

22:11:27 TO THE PEOPLE AND JUST SEE WHAT 

22:11:28 HAPPENS.

22:11:30 WE'LL GET THE ROADS THAT WE 

22:11:31 REALLY DESERVE THAT WAY.

22:11:37 POPULIST ROADS, THANK YOU.

22:11:39 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

22:11:42 NEXT SPEAKER IS MARY HUGHES.

22:11:45 >> MY NAME IS MARIA HUGHES AND 

22:11:47 I'M A CYCLIST.

22:11:50 I'M ALSO THE 25% OF PEOPLE WHO 

22:11:51 DOESN'T LIVE ALONG THAT STRETCH 

22:11:53 OF ROAD BUT STILL SUPPORTS THE 

22:11:53 ROAD DIET.

22:11:55 I'M SPEAKING TODAY THOUGH TO 

22:11:57 URGE THE COUNCIL TO WIDEN THE 

22:11:58 BIKE LAIN TO FIVE FEET 

22:11:59 REGARDLESS OF WHAT YOU DO WITH 

22:12:00 THE ROAD.

22:12:03 THE CURRENT BIKE LANES RUNS 

22:12:06 ALONG PARKED CARS MAKING ITS OWN 

22:12:08 BIKE LANE.

22:12:10 BUT CYCLISTS CALL THESE KIND OF 

22:12:12 LANES DEATH LANE BIKE LANES.

22:12:14 THIS IS BECAUSE IF A MOTORIST 

22:12:16 OCHES THEIR DOOR IN FRONT OF YOU 

22:12:18 YOU HAVE NO TIME TO REACT.

22:12:22 IF YOU ARE TRAVELING, 20 MILES 

22:12:25 AN HOUR, YOU WILL HIT THE DOOR, 

22:12:27 BE FLUNG OUT OF ROADS WAY THAT'S 

22:12:30 PHYSICS, AND IF A CAR IS FASTING 

22:12:32 BY TEN, 20 MILES PER HOUR WITH 

22:12:34 THE SPEED LIMIT THEY WILL HAVE 

22:12:36 NO TIME TO REACT THEY WILL RUN 

22:12:38 YOU OVER AND WILL BE DEAD.

22:12:40 THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED TO ME WHEN 

22:12:42 I WAS BIKING ON A SLEEPIER ROAD 

22:12:45 AND I DECIDED TO RIDE OUTSIDE 

22:12:48 THE BIKE LANE, REGARDLESS HOW 

22:12:50 WIDE THE ROAD WAS.

22:12:51 WHEN THE DOOR OPENED, IT GLANCED 

22:12:52 ME.

22:12:55 I CANNOT DO THIS ON PASEO PADRE 

22:12:57 HOWEVER, THAT TRAFFIC IS GOING 

22:12:57 MUCH FASTER.

22:12:59 THEREFORE A FIVE FOOT BIKE LANE 

22:13:01 IS ESSENTIAL ESPECIALLY SINCE 

22:13:03 YOU'VE NARROWED THE CAR LANES.

22:13:06 THANK YOU.

22:13:08 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU, THE 

22:13:11 NEXT SPEAKER IS WILLIAM RIGBY.

22:13:11 THANK YOU.

22:13:14 >> YES, GOOD EVENING COUNCIL, 

22:13:15 MAYOR MEI.

22:13:18 MAINTAINING PUBLIC SAFETY IS A 

22:13:20 PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF GOVERNMENT, 

22:13:23 SO DESPITE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT 

22:13:24 OF OFF THE TOP OF YOUR HEADING 

22:13:27 OUR POLICE DEPARTMENT RECEIVED, 

22:13:29 NONNEGOTIABLE.

22:13:31 NARROWING THE ROADS THE 

22:13:34 IMPLEMENTATION OF BULBOUTS 

22:13:35 STATES IT SLOWS TRAFFIC.

22:13:37 THAT IS THE POINT OF THESE 

22:13:38 EFFORTS.

22:13:40 FRUSTRATING DRIVERS IS A MUCH 

22:13:42 BETTER SOLUTION THAN IMMINENT 

22:13:46 DEATH OR INJURY TO DRIVER ORS 

22:13:49 CYCLISTS.

22:13:51 MOVING PEOPLE OUT OF SINGLE 

22:13:53 OCCUPANCY VEHICLES IS CRITICAL 

22:13:55 TO REDUCING THE GREENHOUSE 

22:14:00 GASES, AND THE NUMBER OF VEHICLE 

22:14:01 MIMES TRAVELED.

22:14:03 THE ONLY WAY THIS WILL OCCUR IS 

22:14:06 IF OUR STREETS ARE SAFER.

22:14:07 THE PUBLIC WORKS STAFF HAS 

22:14:09 INDICATED THAT THIS SECTION OF 

22:14:12 PASEO PADRE CAN SUPPORT EXISTING 

22:14:14 AND FUTURE TRAFFIC.

22:14:16 I SUPPORT THE PUBLIC WORKS 

22:14:19 STAFF, I AGREE WITH THE FORMER 

22:14:21 PUBLIC WORKS DIRECTOR NORMAN 

22:14:25 HUGHES, THANK YOU.

22:14:26 FTC.

22:14:28 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU, THE 

22:14:30 NEXT SPEAKER WILL BE MARIA.

22:14:47 YOUR MIC IS MUTED FLAVIO.

22:14:49 >> A FEW MONTHS THIS WAS 

22:14:51 DISCUSSED AT THE MOBILITY 

22:14:54 COMMISSION AND I JUST WANTED TO 

22:14:58 MENTION THE COMMISSION HAS 

22:15:00 UNEQUIVOCALLY SUPPORTED THE ROAD 

22:15:01 DIET.

22:15:02 I WANTED TO SHARE A FEW 

22:15:03 THOUGHTS.

22:15:05 RIGHT NOW EXTRA LANES ARE SIMPLY 

22:15:08 NOT NEEDED AND WE HAVE SEEN 

22:15:09 WIFE,000 VEHICLES A DAY, THIS IS 

22:15:11 WHAT YOU CONSIDER A FOUR LANE 

22:15:12 ROAD.

22:15:15 RIGHT NOW WE HAVE 8,400.

22:15:17 EVEN BEFORE THE PANDEMIC THE 

22:15:19 BACKUP WAS NOT CAUSED BY THE 

22:15:20 VEHICLE VOLUMES, IT WAS CAUSED 

22:15:23 BY THE BACKUPS FROM 680 WHICH 

22:15:25 HAS NOW BEEN ADDRESSED AND 

22:15:26 PROBLEMS ON THE FREEWAY SHOULD 

22:15:28 BE ADDRESSED ON THE FREEWAY NOT 

22:15:30 BY THROWING NEIGHBORHOODS UNDER 

22:15:32 THE BUS.

22:15:34 SO I SIMPLY DON'T THINK THAT IN 

22:15:36 THIS CASE THE EXTRA LANES DO 

22:15:37 ANYTHING.

22:15:38 AND I HOPE THAT THAT WILL BE 

22:15:39 PART OF THE DISCUSSION LATER 

22:15:42 THAT THERE IS A FOCUS ON WHAT 

22:15:44 ROLE DO THOSE LANES REALLY PLAY 

22:15:47 IN REDUCING CONGESTION VERSUS 

22:15:48 WHAT ROADS DO THE INTERSECTIONS 

22:15:49 PLAY?

22:15:52 AND WE ALSO HAVE SEEN THAT WITH 

22:15:55 THE PANDEMIC THE TRYING TO 

22:15:58 RETURN TO WORK SLOW MANY PLACES 

22:16:00 HAVE BECOME PERMANENTLY HYBRID.

22:16:03 THE SPEED SURVEY TELLS US A LOT 

22:16:04 MORE THAN THE PEOPLE SURVEY 

22:16:05 BECAUSE WE DO SEE THAT THE 

22:16:07 SPEEDING IS STILL AN ISSUE, IT 

22:16:08 HAS NOT GONE AWAY WHICH WOULDN'T 

22:16:10 BE THE CASE IF THERE WAS A LOT 

22:16:11 OF CONGESTION.

22:16:12 THANK YOU.

22:16:12 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

22:16:14 I JUST WANTED TO REMIND PEOPLE 

22:16:16 ONE MORE TIME THAT YOU CAN ONLY 

22:16:17 SPEAK ONE TIME ON AN ITEM.

22:16:19 AND SO IF YOU HAVE ALREADY 

22:16:21 SPOKEN YOU CANNOT RAISE YOUR 

22:16:23 HAND TO SPEAK AGAIN SO I JUST 

22:16:24 WANTED TO VERIFY BECAUSE I AM 

22:16:26 TRACKING THE SPEAKERS.

22:16:29 SO I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE 

22:16:30 YOU KNOW THAT TOO.

22:16:32 SO IF YOU HAVE ALREADY SPOKEN ON 

22:16:34 THIS ITEM YOU CANNOT RAISE YOUR 

22:16:35 HAND AND SPEAK A SECOND TIME ON 

22:16:36 THIS ITEM.

22:16:41 NEXT SPEAKER IS JANET SHARMA.

22:16:43 I'M GOING TO HAVE TO PROBABLY 

22:16:44 TAKE A BREAK.

22:16:46 I WANT TO FINISH ALL THE 

22:16:48 SPEAKERS BEFORE WE TAKE A BREAK.

22:16:50 >> ARE YOU ABILITY TO HEAR ME?

22:16:51 >> Mayor Mei:   YES.

22:16:53 >> I'M A RESIDENT OF PASEO PADRE 

22:16:54 PARKWAY.

22:16:56 I WANT TO THANK HANS LARSEN 

22:16:58 DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC WORKS AND 

22:17:01 WHOLE FREMONT CITIES AROUND 

22:17:05 STAFF, FOR THE STUDY DONE IN 

22:17:09 RECOMMENDATION OF CALTRANS.

22:17:10 IN FAVOR OF ROAD DIET.

22:17:15 WE SHOULD NOT CHALLENGE THEIR 

22:17:16 EXPERIENCE IN TRANSPORTATION AND 

22:17:17 MORE.

22:17:19 I REQUEST TO APPROVE THE 

22:17:21 PROPOSAL RECOMMENDED BY FREMONT 

22:17:23 CITY ENGINEERING STAFF DURING 

22:17:25 THIS COMMUNITY MEETING FOR PASEO 

22:17:27 PADRE PARKWAY IMPROVEMENTS ON 

22:17:28 APRIL 7th.

22:17:32 AND EVEN MINUTES BACKED BY THE 

22:17:33 DIRECTOR ITSELF.

22:17:34 THE PROPOSAL MENTIONED DURING 

22:17:37 THE MEETING THE CONVERSION OF 

22:17:39 PASEO PADRE BETWEEN DRISCOLL AND 

22:17:41 WASHINGTON INTO TWO LANES ONE 

22:17:43 LANE IN EACH DIRECTION WITH 

22:17:44 BUFFERED BIKE LANE.

22:17:46 THAT IS ALIGNED WITH THE GOALS 

22:17:47 AND VISION OF THE FREMONT 

22:17:51 PROGRAMS LIKE BIKE TO SCHOOL, 

22:17:52 FIVE SCHOOLS IN AREA I'M HEARING 

22:17:56 IT, WHY NOT INCLUDE STUDENT SAFE 

22:17:59 LIKE ALL UNIVERSITIES ACROSS THE 

22:18:01 STATE AND THE COUNTRY.

22:18:04 VISION ZERO PROGRAM, BICYCLE AND 

22:18:05 RESIDENT PROGRAM, SAFE ROUTES TO 

22:18:07 SCHOOL, WALK TO SCHOOL.

22:18:09 AND THERE ARE SOME SUCCESS 

22:18:11 STORIES, I MENTIONED IN 

22:18:13 SEPTEMBER MEETING ITSELF, IN THE 

22:18:15 FREMONT WHICH WE HAVE 

22:18:16 IMPLEMENTED AND SOME OF THOSE 

22:18:20 EXAMPLES FROM LATEST TO THE OLD, 

22:18:24 DRIVE BETWEEN MEASURE A --

22:18:24 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

22:18:30 NEXT SPEAKER IS BRIAN CULP.

22:18:31 >> HI THERE, THANKS FOR THE 

22:18:32 CHANCE TO ADDRESS THE CITY 

22:18:34 COUNCIL.

22:18:37 WHAT I'VE HEARD HERE IN THE 

22:18:39 COMMENTS AND FROM THE COUNCIL IS 

22:18:41 THAT IT SOUNDS TO ME THAT THE 

22:18:43 VAST MAJORITY SUPPORT THE ROAD 

22:18:44 DIET.

22:18:46 AND THE REASON I SAY THAT IS 

22:18:48 BECAUSE I'M LISTENING TO PEOPLE 

22:18:50 OVER AND OVER AGAIN TALKING 

22:18:53 ABOUT SAFETY BEING THEIR HIGHEST 

22:18:55 VALUE IN MAKING THIS DECISION.

22:18:57 AND IF THAT'S THE CASE, THEN THE 

22:18:59 ONLY WAY TO MAKE THAT STRETCH OF 

22:19:01 PASEO PADRE SAFER IS TO REDUCE 

22:19:02 THE SPEEDS.

22:19:03 PEOPLE SPEED ON THAT ROAD 

22:19:04 BECAUSE THEY CAN.

22:19:08 BECAUSE IT'S ENGINEERED TO 

22:19:11 SUPPORT SPEEDS OF 45, 55 AND 

22:19:15 EVEN 60 MILES AN HOUR.

22:19:18 SO, YOU KNOW, I'LL JUST CONCLUDE 

22:19:19 REAL QUICKLY BY JUST ASKING THE 

22:19:21 COUNCIL TO LISTEN TO THE EXPERTS 

22:19:23 WHO HAVE PRESENTED THE DATA AND 

22:19:26 TO VOTE YOUR VALUES, THAT 

22:19:28 PRIORITIZE THE SAFETY ABOVE ALL 

22:19:30 ELSE AND SUPPORT THE ROAD DIET 

22:19:33 FOR PASEO PADRE.

22:19:34 THANKS.

22:19:37 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU, 

22:19:47 KATIA.

22:19:49 >> YES, HI CAN YOU HEAR ME?

22:19:50 >> Mayor Mei:   YES.

22:19:53 >> I LIVE ON PASEO PADRE, NEAR 

22:19:54 OLIVE.

22:19:56 THE HIGH SPEED IS CAUSING A 

22:19:57 SIGNIFICANT SAFETY ISSUE FOR 

22:20:00 PEOPLE THAT ARE TRYING TO MAKE A 

22:20:06 LEFT ONTO OLIVE FROM PASEO.

22:20:07 MR. LARSON TALKED ABOUT ONE OF 

22:20:09 THE ACCIDENTS, ONE OF THE 

22:20:12 ACCIDENTS HAPPENED IN MY FAMILY, 

22:20:14 DRIVER OF HER CAR WAS MAKING HIS 

22:20:18 LEFT TURN FROM OLIVE ONTO PASEO.

22:20:20 THERE WAS A SPEEDING CAR ON 

22:20:21 PASEO.

22:20:24 I'LL NEVER FORGET HOW DANGEROUS 

22:20:25 THIS INTERSECTION IS.

22:20:27 HE ALSO EXPLAINED WITH FACTS WHY 

22:20:29 OPTION 1 IS SAFER AND CARS THAT 

22:20:31 TRAVEL AT THE SPEED LIMIT WILL 

22:20:33 REGULATE THE SPEED OF TRAFFIC.

22:20:35 ALSO 680 HAS BEEN WIDENED WHICH 

22:20:37 SHOULD BE A BIG BENEFIT AS WILL.

22:20:38 I HOPE THE CITY COUNCIL 

22:20:41 APPRECIATES THAT THIS IS NOT A 

22:20:42 POPULARITY CONTEST, IT IS ABOUT 

22:20:44 SAFETY.

22:20:45 PLEASE LISTEN TO THE 

22:20:46 RECOMMENDATION OF YOUR OWN 

22:20:50 SUBJECT MATTER EXPERT MR. LARNZ 

22:20:54  LARSON 

22:20:57 AND PLEASE ADD A TRAFFIC LIGHT 

22:20:59 AT OLIVE AND PASEO PADRE.

22:21:00 THANK YOU.

22:21:02 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

22:21:04 NEXT SPEAKER IS ANITA.

22:21:11 >> HI, THIS IS ANITA, I LIVE ON 

22:21:13 PASEO PADRE, LAST SEVERAL YEARS 

22:21:15 I HAVE WITNESSED SO MANY 

22:21:19 SPEEDING EVERY DAY AND LAST ONE 

22:21:21 CALLER TOLD THAT HE DIDN'T SEE 

22:21:25 THE ACCIDENT SINCE MAY 2013.

22:21:29 I WITNESSED A ACCIDENT IN 2018 

22:21:31 AND CALLED COUNCILMEMBERS AND IN 

22:21:34 2022 I CALLED 911 FOR AN 

22:21:35 ACCIDENT.

22:21:38 AND MY KIDS THEY CANNOT BIKE TO 

22:21:43 HIGH SCHOOL, THE WALKING IS ALSO 

22:21:45 A PROBLEM DEPOSIT ON COVINGTON, 

22:21:46 THEY DON'T STOP.

22:21:48 THEY DON'T HAVE THE VISIBILITY 

22:21:49 SO THEY CANNOT SEE THE 

22:21:52 PEDESTRIAN SO IT'S A VERY NUMBER 

22:21:55 ONE SAFETY ISSUE ON THIS 

22:21:55 STRETCH.

22:21:57 SO I WOULD RECOMMEND THE ROAD 

22:22:00 DIET AND LISTEN TO OUR EXPERTS 

22:22:04 AND TRAFFIC ENGINEERS INSTEAD OF 

22:22:06 DOING THE SURVEYS.

22:22:07 BECAUSE SURVEYS PEOPLE SEEM TO 

22:22:10 HAVE THE FERPTION OF TRAFFIC 

22:22:10 CONGESTION.

22:22:15  PERCEPTION OF TRAFFIC 

22:22:15 CONGESTION.

22:22:18 WE NEED THE EXPERTS INSTEAD OF 

22:22:19 REALIZING THERE IS GOING TO BE 

22:22:21 CONGESTION AFTER THE ROAD DIET.

22:22:24 MAYBE I'LL SUGGEST A PILOT OF 

22:22:26 PLEASURE 1 AND THE RESULTS WILL 

22:22:27 BE THERE.

22:22:29 BUT THE MAIN SAFETY CONCERNS WE 

22:22:32 MUST ADDRESS.

22:22:33 THANK YOU.

22:22:34 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

22:22:36 NEXT SPIEKER IS WENDY.

22:22:39  SPEAKER IS WENDY.

22:22:52 WENDY YOUR MIC IS MUTED.

22:22:56 NEXT SPEAKER IS JOHN WHALEY.

22:23:07 PLEASE UNMUTE YOUR MIC.

22:23:08 THANK YOU.

22:23:10 >> YEAH, SO I HAVE A LITTLE BIT 

22:23:12 OF A DIFFERENT POINT.

22:23:15 I'M AGAINST NIMYISM IN ALL 

22:23:17 POINTS, WHETHER IT'S NOT WANTING 

22:23:22 A HOMELESS NAVIGATE OAR IN YOUR 

22:23:27 OR IN YOUR 

22:23:29 NEIGHBORHOOD, ALWAYS SAFETY, WHO 

22:23:31 CAN ARGUE AGAINST SAFETY, 

22:23:32 EVERYBODY WANTS SAFETY RIGHT?

22:23:34 MANY TIMES THE REAL REASONS 

22:23:36 BEHIND THIS ARE PROPERTY VALUES 

22:23:38 OR CONVENIENCE OR THESE OTHER 

22:23:39 THINGS LIKE THE SAFETY IS A 

22:23:40 SMOKE SCREEN.

22:23:42 YOU FLO THE PEOPLE WHO DECIDED 

22:23:43 TO LIVE ON PASEO PADRE, THEY 

22:23:45 DECIDED TO LIVE THERE.

22:23:46 THEY BOUGHT HOUSES THERE KNOWING 

22:23:48 THE STREET WAS A MAJOR 

22:23:49 THOROUGHFARE.

22:23:52 IS IT WORTH DELAYING THE 13,000 

22:23:55 PLUS PEOPLE, WHO USE THE ROAD, 

22:23:57 FOR THE FEW HUNDRED PEOPLE WHO 

22:23:58 LIVE IN THAT NEIGHBORHOOD, I 

22:24:00 MEAN THERE'S AN ARGUMENT THERE 

22:24:01 BUT LIKE THIS IS JUST SOMETHING 

22:24:02 THAT YOU JUST TO CONSIDER.

22:24:04 BECAUSE THE PEOPLE WHO COME ON A 

22:24:06 CALL LIKE THIS WILL BE THE ONES 

22:24:08 THAT WILL BE MOST DIRECTLY 

22:24:09 AFFECTED AND THE ONES THAT 

22:24:10 YOU'RE STEALING JUST A LITTLE 

22:24:12 BIT IF THEY'RE NOT GOING TO COME 

22:24:13 AND JOIN THE CALL.

22:24:15 I THINK WE NEED A LOT MORE 

22:24:16 AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN FREMONT 

22:24:18 BUT AS WE ADD AFFORDABLE HOUSING 

22:24:21 WE CAN JUST FEEL ALL THE CITY 

22:24:23 SERVICES INCLUDING THE SCHOOL 

22:24:24 CAPACITY AND EVERYTHING ELSE 

22:24:25 THAT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR 

22:24:26 RESPONSIBLE GROWTH.

22:24:32 >> Mayor Mei:   NEXT SPEAKER IS 

22:24:34 WENDY AGAIN IF THEY CAN UNMUTE.

22:24:38 >> HELLO?

22:24:39 >> Mayor Mei:   YES.

22:24:40 >> HI, GOOD EVENING, THANK YOU 

22:24:42 FOR THE OPPORTUNITY.

22:24:44 YES, SO I'M A TREATMENT RESIDENT 

22:24:49 AND I OPPOSE THE REDUCE THE TWO 

22:24:51 LANES TO ONE LANE.

22:24:53 BECAUSE FROM MY EXPERIENCE I 

22:24:55 THINK THAT TWO LANES IS ALL VERY 

22:24:58 IMPORTANT FOR THE PEOPLE WHO USE 

22:25:02 THE ROAD THE MOST, TO STOP THE 

22:25:05 KIDS, PICK UP THE KIDS FROM 

22:25:07 SCHOOL AND, YOU KNOW, DURING 

22:25:10 THAT SCHOOL THAT'S VERY 

22:25:10 IMPORTANT.

22:25:13 AND ALSO FOR THE SAFETY CONCERN 

22:25:16 CHEM SO MY FEELING IS WE SHOULD 

22:25:19 REDUCE THE SPEED, NOT TO REDUCE 

22:25:20 THE LENGTH.

22:25:21 SO THAT'S REPLY OPINION THANK 

22:25:23 YOU.

22:25:24 >> Mayor Mei:   NEXT SPEAKER IS 

22:25:25 MOHIB.

22:25:34 >> HELLO?

22:25:37 >> Mayor Mei:   YES, YOU'RE 

22:25:38 LIVE, YOU CAN SPEAK.

22:25:40 >> AS A RESIDENT OF OLIVE AND 

22:25:43 USING THE BIKE ON PASEO PADRE MY 

22:25:45 REQUEST TO THE COUNCIL IS TO 

22:25:47 VOTE FOR OPTION 1, SAME IS AS 

22:25:48 BELOW.

22:25:50 FIRST OF ALL YOUR STAFF MEMBERS 

22:25:51 HAVE RECOMMENDED, THE 

22:25:52 ENGINEERING STAFF HAS 

22:25:54 RECOMMENDED THE INPUTS FROM BART 

22:25:56 AND VARIOUS SEPARATE AGENCIES SO 

22:25:57 THEY ARE THE BEST JUDGE TO 

22:25:59 DECIDE ON WHAT IS THE BEST FOR 

22:26:00 THE PEOPLE OF FREMONT.

22:26:03 THEY'RE ALSO THE CITY MEMBERS 

22:26:04 ARE ALSO THE FOLKS WHO ARE DOING 

22:26:05 THEIR JOB AND THEY ARE PAID FOR 

22:26:08 IT SO WE SHOULD GO WITH THEIR 

22:26:11 RECOMMENDATION.

22:26:13 THERE WAS A SCENE THAT THE LAST 

22:26:14 TIME WHEN THE RECOMMENDATION WAS 

22:26:19 TAKEN TO REDUCE THE BIKE LANE IT 

22:26:20 WAS TAKEN BASED ON THE 

22:26:23 RECOMMENDATION SO PLEASE DO GIVE 

22:26:24 A ROAD DIET A CHANCE.

22:26:27 AND LASTLY WHAT I ALSO WANTED TO 

22:26:29 COMMUNICATE IS I PERSONALLY HAVE 

22:26:30 NOT VOTED ON THE SURVEY AND 

22:26:32 BEING A MEMBER OF THAT 

22:26:35 NEIGHBORHOOD I DON'T KNOW HOW 

22:26:36 THIS SURVEY WAS MADE INTO THE 

22:26:37 RIGHT PEOPLE WHO ARE LIVING IN 

22:26:39 THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

22:26:41 SO AGAIN I WOULD REQUEST YOU TO 

22:26:43 PLEASE VOTE ON ROAD DIET AS AN 

22:26:44 OPTION GIVE IT A CHANCE AND GIVE 

22:26:47 SAFETY A CHANCE, THANK YOU.

22:26:52 >> Mayor Mei:   NEXT SPEAKER IS 

22:26:53 CHARRETTE.

22:27:01 >> HELLO, CAN YOU HEAR ME?

22:27:03 >> Mayor Mei:   YES.

22:27:04 >> I'M A RESIDENT OF PASEO PADRE 

22:27:06 IN THE AFFECTED AREA.

22:27:08 IT IS TRAIR FIEG TO SEE THE CARS 

22:27:10 SPEEDING ON THE ROADWAY.

22:27:12 50 MILES AN HOUR IS NOT 

22:27:12 UNCOMMON.

22:27:15 I MYSELF HAVE ON OCCASION FOUND 

22:27:17 MYSELF SPEEDING AND CORRECTED 

22:27:17 MYSELF.

22:27:18 I THINK IT IS BECAUSE OF THE 

22:27:19 ROAD DESIGN.

22:27:24 IT IS NOT AN CAIRNL BIKE ISSUE 

22:27:25 BUT A SAFETY ISSUE.

22:27:28 THE PLURAL OF ANECDOTES IS NOT 

22:27:29 DATA.

22:27:31 MR. LARSON AND STAFF RECOMMENDED 

22:27:35 BASED ON DATA THAT THE ROAD DIET 

22:27:36 WORKS FINE FOR THE NUMBER OF 

22:27:38 CARS ON THE STREET.

22:27:39 I'M CONCERNED WITH REDUCTION OF 

22:27:40 THE NUMBER OF LANES.

22:27:43 THE COMMENT THAT MOST RESONATE 

22:27:44 WEDNESDAY ME IS THEY ARE NOT 

22:27:46 TRAFFIC EXPERTS AND SHOULD A 

22:27:48 LITTLE ON EXPERTS TO PROVIDE THE 

22:27:50 DATA.

22:27:51 COUNCILMEMBER COX SAID, SAFETY 

22:27:54 FIRST, I FULLY DISAGREE I'M 

22:27:57 SUPPORTING OPTION 1 I HOPE 

22:27:58 COUNCIL ACCEPTS STAFF 

22:27:59 RECOMMENDATION.

22:27:59 THANK YOU.

22:28:02 >> Mayor Mei:   NEXT SPEAKER IS 

22:28:02 CHUNG.

22:28:10 >> ENGINEERING INVOLVES MAKING 

22:28:13 TRADEOFFS AND GOOD ENGINEERING 

22:28:15 MEANS MAKING GOOD DATA ON 

22:28:16 TRADEOFFS.

22:28:18 REDUCING THE WIDTH OF THE ROAD 

22:28:20 TO ONE LANE SIMULTANEOUSLY YOU 

22:28:24 ARE IN FACT CHANGING TWO 

22:28:26 VARIABLES AT ONCE.

22:28:27 LIMITING STUDYING THE FACT OF 

22:28:29 THE INDIVIDUAL CHANGE IN ORDER 

22:28:32 TO GAUGE THE TRUE EFFECTIVENESS.

22:28:34 WITH ALL DUE RESPECT THIS IS BAD 

22:28:34 ENGINEERING.

22:28:37 AND WITH ALL DUE RESPECT THE 

22:28:38 PUBLIC WORKS DEPARTMENT HAS MADE 

22:28:40 SOME RIDICULOUSLY POOR 

22:28:42 ENGINEERING DECISIONS OF LATE, 

22:28:43 THAT IS CAUSING FREMONT 

22:28:47 TAXPAYERS MILLIONS TO FIX.

22:28:49 WHO WILL TAKE THE RESPONSIBILITY 

22:28:52 FOR THE BAD CHOICES?

22:28:54 LET'S TAKE THIS ONE STEP AT A 

22:28:55 TIME.

22:28:57 ADD THE TRAFFIC LIGHT AT 

22:28:59 COVINGTON WITH OPTION 2.

22:29:02 MEASURE THE RESULT, BEFORE 

22:29:03  

22:29:04 MAKING FURTHER CHANGES.

22:29:08 THANK YOU.

22:29:09 >> Mayor Mei:   LAST SPEAKER IS 

22:29:11 GOING TO BE AMIT AND THEN I'M 

22:29:13 GOING TO PAUSE FOR A BREAK.

22:29:15 AND I'LL CLOSE PUBLIC COMMENT.

22:29:15 AMIT.

22:29:18 >> YES, HI GOOD EVENING MADAM 

22:29:20 MAYOR AND THE COUNCILMEMBERS.

22:29:22 SO I SUPPORT OPTION NUMBER 1 

22:29:24 WHICH IS FOR THE ROAD DIET AND 

22:29:26 MY REASONING FOR THAT IS THAT WE 

22:29:28 HAVE IN THE LAST MEETING THAT WE 

22:29:30 HAD, I 30 THE MAIN ISSUE WAS 

22:29:32 THAT WE WERE LACKING THE DATA 

22:29:34 AND THE STUDY TO BE DONE.

22:29:37 AND I THINK BASED ON THE 

22:29:38 DETAILED STUDY AND THE 

22:29:39 COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS DONE BY 

22:29:42 THE CITY STAFF AND ENGINEERING 

22:29:44 WHICH I APPRECIATE THE DILIGENCE 

22:29:45 BEING DONE THERE AND THE DATA 

22:29:48 PROVIDED I THINK THE DESIGN 

22:29:50 SUPPORTS STAFF TRAFFIC OF TODAY 

22:29:52 AS WELL AS FUTURE.

22:29:54 SO CONSIDERING SAFETY FIRST AND 

22:29:57 FOR THE PEOPLE WHO ARE DAILY 

22:30:00 USING THIS AREA, WE SHOULD 

22:30:02 SUPPORT OPTION NUMBER 1 FOR THIS 

22:30:03 PLAN.

22:30:03 THANK YOU.

22:30:05 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

22:30:06 AND AT THIS TIME, I'M GOING TO 

22:30:08 CLOSE THE PUBLIC COMMENT AND GO 

22:30:09 FOR A TEN MINUTE BREAK.

22:30:11 BECAUSE WE DO NEED AT LEAST TEN 

22:30:14 MINUTES FOR OUR STENO CAPTIONER 

22:30:16 BECAUSE WE'VE GONE OVER QUITE 

22:30:17 SIGNIFICANT AND THEN I WILL 

22:30:19 RETURN TO OUR COMMENTS.

22:30:21 AND I HAVE PLENTY.

22:30:22 I THINK WE ALL DO.

22:30:29 AT THIS TIME LEASE TURN OFF YOUR 

22:30:32 MIC AND TURN OFF YOUR VIDEO.

22:40:57 [ RECESS ]

22:40:59 >> Mayor Mei:   WELCOME BACK.

22:40:59 THERE ARE NO PUBLIC COMMENTS AT 

22:41:00 THIS TIME BECAUSE WE ARE GOING 

22:41:02 TO GO TO THE COUNCIL FOR 

22:41:04 DISCUSSION.

22:41:06 WE'VE CLOSED PUBLIC COMMENT.

22:42:35 >> Mayor Mei: LET'S BRING THIS MEETING BACK.

22:42:38 I HAVE SOME CLARIFYING QUESTIONS THAT I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE COUNCILMEMBER 
22:42:39 SALWAN BACK IF POSSIBLE.

22:42:51 THANK YOU FOR ALL THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE SPOKEN AND THOSE WHO HAVE WRITTEN US, 
22:42:53 WE HAVE RECORDED FOR PUBLIC COMMENTS.

22:43:04 






22:43:40 >> Mayor Mei: WE'VE CERTAINLY HEARD A LOT FROM MANY PEOPLE THIS EVENING 
22:43:43 ABOUT THE COMMENTS.

22:43:48 I WANTED TO ASK HANS ON A COUPLE OF THINGS, SOME OF THE PEOPLE HAVE SPOKEN 
22:43:53 ON THIS, ACTC HAS BEEN WRITING A LETTER, WE'VE BEEN SEEING THE 
22:43:57 DISCUSSION, I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY THE NUMBER, PER SE, BUT A LOT OF THE 
22:44:01 QUESTIONS HAVE SURFACED AROUND ENFORCEMENT, AND HOW MANY OFFICERS DO 
22:44:04 WE HAVE PER SHIFT?

22:44:08 I THINK, RICK, YOU MIGHT KNOW SOME OF THIS TOO, COUNCILMEMBER JONES, PER 
22:44:10 SHIFT IN THE CITY?

22:44:15 AND PLEASE NOTE, THE CITY IS  90-SOME SQUARE MILES, AND SO ABSOLUTELY, WE 
22:44:23 WOULD LOVE TO HAVE PEOPLE PATROL, BUT REALISTICALLY, HOW MANY OFFICERS DO WE 
22:44:25 HAVE PER SHIFT, ROUGHLY?

22:44:28 >> Councilmember Jones: IF I CAN MAKE A COMMENT REAL QUICK, THE LAST I HEARD, 
22:44:32 SO THE OFFICERS THAT WOULD BE ENFORCING THE SPEED WOULD BE THE OFFICERS FROM 
22:44:39 THE TRAFFIC UNIT, AND THE LAST I HEARD CURRENTLY WE HAVE TWO TRAFFIC OFFICERS 
22:44:40 PER SHIFT.

22:44:45 THAT MAY HAVE CHANGED DUE TO THE STAFFING SHORTAGES, BUT THAT'S FOR 92 
22:44:45 SQUARE MILES.

22:44:47 >> Mayor Mei: YES.

22:44:52 SO PLEASE NOTE, WE HAVE OTHER OFFICERS FOR OTHER CRIMES AND OTHER UNITS, BUT 
22:44:53 THAT'S HOW MANY WE HAVE.

22:44:59 SO ONE THING IS, HAVE WE -- AND PERHAPS THAT'S SOMETHING RAFAEL OR KARENA 
22:45:04 WOULD KNOW, HAVE WE EVER PASSED A SAFETY BOND AS A CITY?

22:45:10 >> City Mgr. Shackelford: I DON'T BELIEVE WE HAVE.

22:45:16 I MEAN, MAYBE SPECIFIC TO FIRE SERVICES, BUT NOT PUBLIC SAFETY AS A 
22:45:17 WHOLE.

22:45:19 >> Mayor Mei: OKAY, THAT'S ONE OTHER QUESTION I HAD.

22:45:22 SO JUST TO LET PEOPLE KNOW, THOSE ARE TWO OPTIONS.

22:45:28 THE OTHER ONE WHICH, HANS, YOU AND I HAVE TALKED ABOUT AT ALAMEDA COUNTY 
22:45:30 TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION, THERE IS A DISCUSSION STATEWIDE USED IN OTHER 
22:45:36 STATES RIGHT NOW, AND IT'S NOT AVAILABLE YET THOUGH I WOULD LOVE FOR 
22:45:40 US TO BE IN THE PILOT, WHICH IS, I BELIEVE THERE'S A DISCUSSION RIGHT NOW 
22:45:44 IN OTHER STATES WHERE IT'S AUTO  TICKETING, AND I WOULD LOVE FOR US TO 
22:45:46 BE PART OF THE PILOT AND I'VE SUBMITTED THAT.

22:45:52 SO FOR ALL THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE ASKED ABOUT ENFORCEMENT, PART OF IT IS 
22:45:55 SAFETY AND I WOULD ABSOLUTELY AGREE THAT IF THERE'S A DISCUSSION, IT'S NOT 
22:46:00 JUST ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT WE HAVE A ROAD DIET, IT'S THE FACT THAT SADLY, 
22:46:05 PEOPLE DO NOT SEEM TO BE COMPLYING WITH THE SPEED LIMIT THROUGHOUT THE CITY.

22:46:11 I HAD THE -- THIS PAST COUPLE WEEKS, JUST TO LET YOU KNOW BESIDES ALAMEDA 
22:46:16 COUNTY TRANSPORTATION, WE ALSO HAD ROLL AND STROLL AND WALK TO SCHOOL DAY.

22:46:21 I WAS SURPRISED TO SEE AT SOME OF THE SCHOOL, THE BELL OR SAFETY PATROL USED 
22:46:25 TO BEGIN AT 7:50 IN THE MORNING, PEOPLE WOULD GET THERE AND START TO GET 
22:46:28 PEOPLE LINED UP, BUT WHAT I SAW THROUGHOUT SOME OF THE SCHOOLS IS THAT 
22:46:34 PEOPLE DIDN'T SHOW UP UNTIL 8:15, WHICH IS THE FIRST BELL AND YET PEOPLE WERE 
22:46:38 GOING THROUGH AT 8:30, AND I AM SAD TO SAY THAT WHEN I'M WATCHING SOME OF THE 
22:46:45 SCHOOL SITES WHERE I'VE BEEN OUT THERE, AND I DON'T KNOW IF -- WE DON'T HAVE 
22:46:49 TICKETING DATA BUT SOME OF THE WORST DRIVERS I SEE ARE THE PARENTS 
22:46:54 THEMSELVES DROPPING OFF THE  KIDS, BECAUSE I'VE SEEN SUCH INCREDIBLY BAD 
22:46:58 BEHAVIOR OF BLOCKING PEOPLE'S DRIVEWAYS, AND I ABSOLUTELY UNDERSTAND 
22:47:02 THAT WE NEED TO GET FIVE SCHOOLS THERE, BUT I SEE PEOPLE BLOCKING PEOPLE'S 
22:47:07 DRIVEWAY, PARKING IN THE HANDICAPPED, PARKING IN THE FIRE ZONE, DOUBLE 
22:47:12 PARKING, CUTTING AROUND PEOPLE WHO ARE PARKED, AND SO THE ENDANGERMENT THAT I 
22:47:17 SEE IS NOT JUST TO THIS QUESTION ABOUT THE ROAD DIET.

22:47:23 IT ABOUT THE THOUGHTFULNESS OF PEOPLE GETTING OUT AND I HAVE SEEN 
22:47:26 UNFORTUNATELY SOME OF OUR BUSINESSES, BECAUSE PEOPLE WANT TO CUT THROUGH, 
22:47:30 INSTEAD OF WAITING AT A LIGHT, I KNOW OF A REALTOR NEARBY WHO HAS TO CHAIN 
22:47:36 OFF HIS PARKING LOT BECAUSE PEOPLE CUT THROUGH IT AT 40, 50 MILES AN HOUR 
22:47:43 TRYING TO CUT THROUGH THE LIGHT TO NOT STOP, AND I COULD SAY FOR THAT CORNER 
22:47:46 THERE, I SEE PEOPLE CUT THROUGH THE GAS STATION OR TRY TO FLY THROUGH THE 
22:47:50 PARKING LOT OF THAT STRIP MALL TO AVOID HAVING TO WAIT.

22:47:56 I THINK THAT THERE ARE MANY PRONGS TO THIS ISSUE, AND I KNOW THAT 
22:48:02 ABSOLUTELY, PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE NEED TO GET TO SCHOOL ON TIME, BUT 
22:48:05 I THINK IT'S ALSO A QUESTION ABOUT COURTESY AND RESPONSIBILITY.

22:48:09 AND SO IF YOU DON'T WAIT UNTIL 10 MINUTES BEFORE SCHOOL STARTS TO TRY TO 
22:48:15 LEAVE ALL AT ONCE, THAT IS A CHALLENGE, AND THE BEHAVIOR OF BEING RESPECTFUL 
22:48:19 -- AND I KNOW PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S OVERFLOW 
22:48:23 INTO OTHER STREETS, BUT IF YOU KNOW THAT YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THE 
22:48:28 OVERFLOW INTO OTHER STREETS AND YOU LIVE IN A RESIDENTIAL AREA, I LIVE IN 
22:48:32 A RESIDENTIAL AREA THAT USED TO BE A CUT-THROUGH PARALLEL FOR MISSION 
22:48:37 BOULEVARD, AND I KNOW TOO WELL THAT WE HAVE SPEED BUMPS IN OUR STREET, CANYON 
22:48:43 HEIGHT, ONLY BECAUSE SOMEBODY DECIDED THEY WANTED TO GO AT SUCH SPEED, THEY 
22:48:47 DECIDE TODAY KILL A MOTHER BECAUSE THEY WERE DRIVING SO QUICKLY, THEY BLEW 
22:48:50 THROUGH A STOP SIGN AND MANY YEARS AGO KILLED A MOTHER BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT 
22:48:52 IT WAS MORE IMPORTANT TO GET TO THEIR PLACE ON TIME.

22:48:55 SO I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THE FACT THAT IF YOU WANT TO GET SOMEWHERE ON TIME, 
22:49:01 YOU HAVE TO GET THERE SAFELY STILL IN RESPECT OF OTHERS, AND THERE ARE 
22:49:06 PEOPLE WHO -- PASEO PADRE IS A MAJOR CORRIDOR, BUT I DON'T THINK ANYONE, 
22:49:12 AND I SAW THIS DURING THE CHANGES WE SAW,  CUT-THROUGH TRAFFIC AT POINTS ON 
22:49:16 MISSION BOULEVARD IN FRONT OF MISSION HIGH SCHOOL WHEN SOME OF THE LANES 
22:49:21 WERE IMPLEMENTED, PEOPLE WERE SO RUDE, THEY WOULD NOT LET PEOPLE BACK OUT OF 
22:49:22 THEIR OWN DRIVEWAYS.

22:49:24 SO I THINK THAT THERE IS A FINE BALANCE BETWEEN THAT.

22:49:28 IF YOU KNOW THAT SPEED SOMETHING A PROBLEM AND YOU NEED TO GET THERE AND 
22:49:31 YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT OVERFLOW, I THINK THERE'S A COUPLE THINGS THAT I WOULD 
22:49:34 LIKE TO SEE, AND I'LL JUST MAKE GENERAL COMMENTS.

22:49:39 I KNOW THAT THE YOUNG STUDENT SPEAKER SPOKE ABOUT IT. I THINK FOR OLIVE, I 
22:49:46 WOULDN'T JUST WANT A BEACON, DIRECTOR LARSEN, I WOULD WANT A HAWK.

22:49:48 AND SO THE HAWK MAKES IT A STOP.

22:49:53 SO IF THERE IS SOMEONE PUSHING THAT BUTTON, IT'S NO LONGER A WOULD YOU 
22:49:57 LIKE TO STOP FOR THE STUDENTS, BECAUSE SADLY, IN FRONT OF SOME OTHER MAJOR 
22:50:02 INTERSECTIONS, I'VE HEARD FROM THE CROSSING GUARDS THAT THEY'VE BEEN 
22:50:07 STRUCK FOUR TIMES THIS YEAR ALONE BECAUSE PEOPLE STOP TOO SLOW, AND 
22:50:11 WHILE THEY DIDN'T CAUSE PHYSICAL INJURY BESIDES BUMPING THE PERSON OR KNOCKING 
22:50:15 THEM OVER, SO IT DOESN'T JUSTIFY TRUE BODILY HARM, IT IS UPSETTING TO KNOW 
22:50:19 THAT PEOPLE ARE THAT AGGRESSIVE THAT THEY WOULD ACTUALLY HIT THE CROSSING 
22:50:20 GUARD IN THAT SITUATION.

22:50:26 THERE ARE ADULTS WITH A STOP SIGN, SO I'M NOT SURE A BEACON THERE WOULD 
22:50:28 SUFFICE, I WOULD WANT A HAWK FOR OLIVE.

22:50:38 ALL THESE PEOPLE WHO SENT THEIR LETTERS WHO ABSOLUTELY THINK WE WANT TO KEEP 
22:50:42 THE LANE BUT WANT TO HAVE MORE ENFORCEMENT, I THINK THEY SHOULD SIGN 
22:50:46 THAT LETTER WITH ME IN SOLIDARITY TO ASK FOR AUTO ENFORCEMENT, AUTO 
22:50:47 TICKETING.

22:50:51 AND I THINK THAT THAT'S SOMETHING WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO ADD TOO.

22:50:55 AND THEN FINALLY, IF YOU THINK THAT WE NEED MORE ENFORCEMENT, WHICH I THINK 
22:50:59 MANY PEOPLE SAY RIGHT NOW FOR DIFFERENT ISSUES, THEN YOU SHOULD ALSO JOIN ME 
22:51:01 IN ASKING AND WORKING TO GET A PUBLIC SAFETY BOND.

22:51:04 SO THOSE ARE MY THREE GENERAL COMMENTS.

22:51:09 I DON'T THINK WE'VE EVER HAD ONE, AND I DON'T KNOW IF ANYONE CAN COMMENT, I 
22:51:11 BELIEVE I'VE  LOOKED OVER THE PAST VOTING RECORDS.

22:51:16 I ALSO THINK THAT I PERSONALLY KNOW FIRSTHAND, BECAUSE I'VE SEEN A 
22:51:21 STUDENT, ONE OF THOSE CASES IT'S MY OWN CHILD, WHO WHEN THEY GOT HIT IN THE 
22:51:24 CAR IN SOME OF THIS CROSSWALK, RIGHT ACROSS FROM A SCHOOL, ODDLY ENOUGH, 
22:51:28 ALL THE PARENTS DROVE BY AND JUST SAID, PLEASE MOVE YOUR CAR OUT OF THE WAY, 
22:51:32 YOU'RE BLOCKING ME FROM GETTING TO SCHOOL, WITHOUT HAVING CARE AT ALL FOR 
22:51:34 ANOTHER PERSON'S CHILD.

22:51:41 I HAVE ALSO KNOWN OF STUDENTS WHO HAVE BEEN ON A BICYCLE WHO IS 6-FOOT 
22:51:44 SOMETHING, AND WHEN A PARENT STRUCK THEM, THEY WERE MORE CONCERNED ABOUT 
22:51:49 BEING LATE TO THEIR CHILD'S VIOLIN OR PIANO LESSON THAN THE FACT THAT THEY 
22:51:50 JUST HIT SOMEONE ELSE'S KID.

22:51:56 SO I AM DEEPLY DISMAYED BY SOME OF THE BEHAVIOR, AND I THINK IF WE WANT TO 
22:51:59 HAVE RESPECT AND SAFETY, YOU NEED TO HAVE RESPECT AND SAFETY FOR OTHER 
22:52:01 PEOPLE'S CHILDREN AS MUCH AS YOU DO FOR YOUR OWN.

22:52:05 AND SO I THINK THAT THAT'S SOMETHING -- I MEAN, I'VE SEEN PEOPLE AS RECENT AS 
22:52:09 JUST A FEW WEEKS A WHEN YOU'RE GOING THROUGH A CROSSWALK, YOU'RE IN A HURRY 
22:52:13 TO MAKE THAT RIGHT TURN, SHOULD NOT BE CHASING PEOPLE'S CHILDREN WITH YOUR 
22:52:13 CAR.

22:52:17 SO THOSE ARE ABSOLUTELY SOME OF THE REASONS WHY I AM TRYING TO CONCERN 
22:52:21 MYSELF WITH ALL THESE DIFFERENT OPTIONS, BUT I WANT TO HEAR FROM THE 
22:52:24 FELLOW COUNCILMEMBERS WHAT YOUR OPTIONS ARE AND WHETHER OR NOT YOU'D SUPPORT 
22:52:26 ME IN SOME OF THESE AMENDMENTS AND DISCUSSIONS.

22:52:28 SO I'LL START WITH VICE MAYOR SALWAN.

22:52:36 >> Vice Mayor Salwan: HI, MADAME MAYOR.

22:52:39 I THINK ONE OR TWO SPEAKERS MENTIONED THE WIDTH OF THE MEDIAN.

22:52:46 I DID FIND THAT THE MEDIAN IS HUMONGOUS IN THAT AREA, AND MAYBE ADDS TO SOME 
22:52:48 OF THE DISTRACTION THERE, ESPECIALLY AS YOU CURVE.

22:52:51 IS THERE SOME THOUGHT ABOUT MAKING THE MEDIAN SMALLER?

22:52:56 IS THAT POSSIBLE ARE OH COST PROHIBITIVE?

22:52:58 WHAT'S THE THINKING THERE?

22:53:05 >> Mr. Larsen: I THINK YOUR INITIAL THOUGHT IS THAT THAT IS A FAIRLY 
22:53:07 EXPENSIVE THING TO DO.

22:53:16 JUST KIND OF LISTENING TO THE DISCUSSION AND KIND OF VIEWS ON BOTH 
22:53:20 SIDES, IT'S SOMETHING WE COULD LOOK AT, BUT I THINK IN THE SCHEME OF KIND OF 
22:53:27 THE THINGS THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IN TERMS OF INVESTMENTS, THAT'S PROBABLY 
22:53:28 MANY MAGNITUDES HIGHER.

22:53:34 I THINK WE INCLUDED IN OUR STAFF REPORT THAT A NEW SIGNAL, A COUPLE SETS OF 
22:53:41 FLASHING BEACONS, SIGNAL MODERNIZATION AND ROAD DIET, SOMEWHERE IN THE RANGE 
22:53:49 OF A MILLION AND A HALF DOLLARS OF CONSTRUCTION INVESTMENT.

22:53:55 I THINK IF YOU'RE NARROWING THE MEDIAN ON BOTH SIDES GIVEN THE LENGTH OF THE 
22:53:57 ROADWAY, WE'RE LOOKING AT A COST SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THAT.

22:54:04 I'D HAVE TO HAVE OUR TEAM TAKE A LOOK AT IT, BUT I THINK GENERALLY THE 
22:54:05 CONCERN IS THAT WOULD BE COST PROHIBITIVE.

22:54:06 >> Vice Mayor Salwan: OKAY.

22:54:11 AND OLIVE WAS MENTIONED A COUPLE OF TIMES AS ONE OF THE STUDENTS MENTIONED 
22:54:12 CROSSING THERE.

22:54:19 SO I DID AGREE WITH THE MAYOR THAT MAYBE WE CAN DO A MORE ROBUST HAWK OR 
22:54:23 I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS, BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU PRESS A BUTTON AND THE 
22:54:28 LIGHT BLINKS, SO I THINK THAT'S A GOOD IDEA OR ANYTHING MORE WE CAN DO AS FAR 
22:54:32 AS STOP SIGN, SO I THINK TWO STOPS, THE TRAFFIC LIGHT AND SOMETHING ELSE 
22:54:36 FURTHER DOWN WOULD HOPEFULLY PREVENT THAT TRAFFIC FROM ESCALATING.

22:54:44 SO I DON'T KNOW, IS THIS A GOOD TIME TO GO TO COMMENTS, MAYOR, OR --

22:54:46 >> Mayor Mei: I THINK WE ALREADY HAVE SOME QUESTIONS.

22:54:47 WE WENT AROUND WITH SOME OF  THAT.

22:54:51 IF YOU WANT TO MAKE COMMENTS ON WHAT YOU'D LIKE TO SUPPORT, WE CAN MOVE 
22:54:53 FORWARD WITH OUR RESOLUTION IN TERMS OF OUR DECISION.

22:54:55 >> Vice Mayor Salwan: SOUNDS GOOD, MAYOR.

22:55:02 WELL, THIS IS A VERY CRUCIAL PART OF PASEO PADRE, BECAUSE IT CONNECTS THE 
22:55:04 SOUTH TO CENTRAL FREMONT.

22:55:17 SO MANY FOLKS THAT LIVE IN THE MISSION SAN JOSÉ THAT USE TO GO TO LAKE 
22:55:21 ELIZABETH, DOWNTOWN, MANY OTHER PARTS, IF THIS AREA IS IMPACTED, IT WILL 
22:55:25 DEFINITELY CAUSE MORE PEOPLE TO GET ON THE FREEWAY OR MAYBE EEN GO TO 
22:55:32  EVEN GO TO MILIPITAS BECAUSE THAT MIGHT BE EASIER THAN TO GO TO CENTRAL 
22:55:32 FREMONT.

22:55:34 IT DEFINITELY HAS SOME CHALLENGES.

22:55:38 I THINK OUR FOREFATHERS, OR WHOEVER DESIGNED THIS STREET, I DON'T KNOW HOW 
22:55:41 THEY JOINED PASEO PADRE BUT IT'S LIKE A BIG CIRCLE AND DEFINITELY THIS PART 
22:55:42 WAS NOT DESIGNED WELL.

22:55:47 SO NOW WE HAVE TO UNDO ALL THAT OVERBUILT STREET THAT WE HAVE THERE.

22:55:54 AND SO IT'S NOT EASY, AND SO I KIND OF FEEL LIKE THERE'S SOME THINGS WE CAN 
22:55:58 DO IMMEDIATELY, AND WE SHOULD DEFINITELY DO THOSE, AND SOME THINGS 
22:56:00 WE CAN LOOK LONG-RANGE.

22:56:03 YOU KNOW, THIS IS A REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACY.

22:56:04 WE REPRESENT THE PEOPLE.

22:56:09 AND THE PEOPLE CLEARLY ARE NOT READY TO REMOVE THIS LIGHT.

22:56:17 AND SO AS FAR AS THE DATA  POINTS, I THINK 75% OF THE FOLKS HAVE INDICATED 
22:56:22 THAT THEY DON'T WANT TO REMOVE THE SECOND LANE, AND THE THING THAT'S VERY 
22:56:28 NOTABLE IS THAT THE PEOPLE WITHIN PASEO, HALF OF THEM DON'T WANT THIS 
22:56:28 EITHER.

22:56:33 SO I FEEL LIKE, YOU KNOW, IF WE'RE GOING TO DO A PROGRAM, WE WANT TO MAKE 
22:56:37 SURE WE HAVE THE COMMUNITY'S SUPPORT, AND THAT THE PEOPLE THAT ARE LIVING 
22:56:39 THERE STRONGLY SUPPORT IT.

22:56:46 SO IF ONLY HALF OF THE PEOPLE AROUND PASEO PADRE SUPPORT IT, THAT MAKES ME 
22:56:46 CONCERNED.

22:56:54 AND SO I THINK AT THIS POINT, I THINK DEFINITELY ALL THE SIGNAL CHANGES, YOU 
22:57:00 KNOW, OLIVE, COVINGTON, THERE WAS ANOTHER, THREE CHANGES THAT WE WERE 
22:57:02 GOING TO MAKE, I THINK THOSE ARE GOOD.

22:57:08 I'M NOT READY TO GO TO THE NEXT LEVEL, ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING MOST OF THE 
22:57:09 COMMUNITY MEMBERS ARE NOT THERE YET.

22:57:14 SO MAYBE WITH TIME AS WE MAKE THESE CHANGES, WE CAN EVALUATE WHERE THIS 
22:57:19 GOES, AND IF WE FEEL THAT THERE'S ADDITIONAL THINGS THAT COULD BE DONE, 
22:57:24 ESPECIALLY ONCE THE PANDEMIC TRAFFIC PICKS UP AND WE CAN EVALUATE THAT, 
22:57:26 THEN WE CAN GO TO THE NEXT THING.

22:57:30 SO WITH THAT, I THINK I WOULD GO WITH OPTION 2.

22:57:38 I'M OPEN TO THE SUGGESTION TO INCREASE THE BIKE LANE TO 5 FEET AS MR. LARSEN 
22:57:41 MENTIONED, AND ANY OTHER CREATIVE IDEAS.

22:57:45 I'M ALSO OPEN TO EXPLORING THE PARKING SITUATION BUT AGAIN, I THINK AT THIS 
22:57:49 POINT, THE COMMUNITY IS NOT READY FOR THAT YET, BUT IF THERE'S SOME TWEAKS 
22:57:54 WE CAN DO TO THE PARKING OR REMOVE THE PARKING, I THINK THAT CAN ALSO GIVE US 
22:57:56 SOME MORE FLEXIBILITY.

22:57:59 SO THAT'S MY COMMENTS FOR NOW, THANK YOU.

22:58:00 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

22:58:04 DIRECTOR LARSEN, CAN WE PULL UP THE OPTION DECISION SLIDE AGAIN SO WE CAN 
22:58:06 LOOK AT THAT WHEN WE MAKE THAT DISCUSSION?

22:58:09 I THINK IT WILL MAKE IT EASIER FOR THE CONVERSATION.

22:58:14 THANK YOU.

22:58:19 NEXT, I THINK ON MY COUNCIL, WE HAVE COUNCILMEMBER SHAO.

22:58:21 >> Councilmember Shao: THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR.

22:58:28 TODAY, WE ALL FACE THE SAME ISSUE.

22:58:31 THIS PART OF PASEO PADRE, WHICH IS SPEEDING.

22:58:38 AND WE ARE EXPECTED TO MAKE A DECISION TO ADDRESS THAT  PROBLEM.

22:58:43 AS SOMEONE WITH A SCIENTIFIC BACK GROUND ALWAYS LOOKS FOR DATA, I 
22:58:49 ACTUALLY FIRST THANK MR. LARSEN AND HIS TEAM FOR PROVIDING CERTAIN DATA FOR 
22:58:59 OUR CONSIDERATION, FOR EXAMPLE, 16% OF THE DRIVERS WERE SPEEDING RECENTLY 
22:59:05 DURING THE -- YOU KNOW, AFTER WE NARROWED THE LANES.

22:59:08 THAT IS A PIECE OF DATA THAT WE JUST SAW.

22:59:13 ALSO, WE HAVE POLLS FROM THE COMMUNITY.

22:59:22 FOR THE DATA ITSELF, FROM MY POINT OF VIEW, IT COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER IF WE 
22:59:26 CAN HAVE MORE DATA REGARDING THE SPEEDING.

22:59:33 FOR EXAMPLE, RIGHT NOW WE HAVE ALREADY NARROWED DOWN THE LANES OR EVEN 
22:59:36 APPLIED ROAD DIET ON MANY ROADS THROUGHOUT THE CITY.

22:59:43 IT WOULD BE INTERESTING TO SEE OVERALL, EVEN FOR THE ROADS THAT ALREADY ARE 
22:59:49 UNDER THE ROAD DIET, HOW MANY PERCENTAGE OF DRIVERS ARE STILL 
22:59:49 SPEEDING.

22:59:54 SO THAT WOULD PUT US IN A MUCH BIGGER PICTURE IN TERMS OF THE EFFECTIVENESS 
22:59:59 OF ROAD DIET IN REDUCING THE SPEED.

23:00:08 WE KNOW TRAFFIC SIGNALS WILL SLOW DOWN THE DRIVERS, FLASHING BEACONS AS WELL.

23:00:14 WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE CONGESTION DEFINITELY WILL SLOW DOWN  PEOPLE.

23:00:22 AND SO IF THE ROAD DIET CREATES CONGESTION, I'M QUITE SURE THAT 
23:00:25 OVERALL, THERE'S NO PHYSICAL POSSIBILITY FOR PEOPLE TO SPEED 
23:00:27 BECAUSE THE ROAD IS BLOCKED.

23:00:39 WHEN I LOOK AT THE VOLUME OF 16,000 CARS, ACTUALLY I WONDER WHETHER THAT 
23:00:47 NUMBER IS JUST A TOTAL VOLUME FOR DAY OR IT COULD BE MORE HELPFUL IF WE CAN 
23:00:52 FIND OUT DURING PEAK HOURS WHAT IS THE VOLUME OF THE TRAFFIC.

23:00:59 I BELIEVE IT IS VERY IMPORTANT.

23:01:04 JUST TWO WEEKS AGO, THE INTERSECTION IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD AT THE WASHINGTON AND 
23:01:13 DRISCOLL SUDDENLY FOUR BULBOUTS WERE BUILT, AND IT DID NOT CATCH MY 
23:01:21 ATTENTION UNTIL SUDDENLY I FOUND MYSELF UNABLE TO TURN LEFT AND GET INTO THE 
23:01:30 ROAD, BECAUSE THERE'S --

23:01:32 >> Mayor Mei: MY APOLOGIES, COUNCILMEMBER SHAO.

23:01:35 YOU HAVE FROZEN.

23:01:45 IT MIGHT HELP IF YOU TURN OFF YOUR VIDEO, IF THERE IS A BROADBAND ACCESS 
23:01:52 -- I'M GOING TO GO TO COUNCILMEMBER JONES FOR NOW, TEMPORARILY, AT LEAST, 
23:01:57 BECAUSE COUNCILMEMBER SHAO DOES NOT SEEM TO BE TRANSMITTING AT THIS TIME.

23:01:59 COUNCILMEMBER JONES.

23:02:01 >> Councilmember Jones: THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR.

23:02:08 SO WITHOUT GOING INTO A LOT OF DETAIL, I AGREE WITH ALL OF THE COMMENTS THAT 
23:02:14 VICE MAYOR SALWAN MADE, PARTICULARLY IN RESPECT TO WHAT OUR RESIDENTS HAVE 
23:02:18 SAID THAT THEY WANT.

23:02:25 AS WE SAID, WE'RE A REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACY AND WE ARE HERE REALLY AT 
23:02:29 THE PLEASURE OF OUR RESIDENTS, SO I THINK THE SURVEYS REALLY SPEAK VOLUMES.

23:02:33 JUST ONE NOTE ABOUT THE HISTORY OF PASEO PADRE AND WHY IT'S SO WIDE, AND 
23:02:39 I GOT THIS FROM FORMER MAYOR GUS MORRISON, WHO IS KIND OF OUR 
23:02:43 UNOFFICIAL FREMONT HISTORIAN, APPARENTLY IN THE EARLY 60s, FREMONT 
23:02:48 LEADERSHIP DETERMINED THAT THE POPULATION OF FREMONT, BY THE END OF 
23:02:52 1990s, WOULD BE SOMEWHERE CLOSE TO 360,000 PEOPLE.

23:02:56 AND SO, THEREFORE, WHEN ALL OF OUR STREET WERE LAID OUT, THEY WERE LAID 
23:03:03 OUT WITH NICE WIDE LANES, BIG MEDIANS, YOU KNOW, FRONTAGE ROAD, ALL OF THOSE 
23:03:03 KINDS OF THINGS.

23:03:08 THANKFULLY WE HAVE NOT GOTTEN THERE YET, BUT IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT THE STATE 
23:03:16 WANTS US TO DO IN PROVIDING 13,500 HOUSES IN THE NEXT SIX YEARS, YOU'RE 
23:03:20 TALKING ANYWHERE BETWEEN 13, 14,000 PEOPLE AND ABOUT CLOSE TO 60,000 
23:03:20 PEOPLE.

23:03:23 SO TRAFFIC IS GOING TO DO NOTHING BUT GET WORSE.

23:03:29 THIS IS A MAJOR ARTERY THAT RUNS BASICALLY ALL THE WAY THROUGH FREMONT.

23:03:35 I HAVE DRIVEN THIS A NUMBER OF TIMES IN THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS JUST IN 
23:03:38 ANTICIPATION OF THIS ITEM COMING BACK.

23:03:45 AND I HAVE YET TO SEE -- I TAKE THAT BACK, I SAW ONE BICYCLIST, AND I 
23:03:50 COUNTED I THINK AT THE MOST 14 CARS PARKED ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AT ANY 
23:03:50 GIVEN TIME.

23:03:58 THE BIKE LANE DOES SEEM TO BE ADEQUATE, IF PART OF OUR SAFETY PLAN IS THE SAFE 
23:04:03 ROUTES TO SCHOOLS, THEN AS I MENTIONED EARLIER, WHEN YOU'RE RIDING A BICYCLE 
23:04:08 UP TO AGE 16, YOU CAN ACTUALLY RIDE ON THE SIDEWALK, WHICH IS MUCH SAFER THAN 
23:04:13 TRYING TO RIDE IN THE STREET, WHETHER YOU'RE IN A BICYCLE LANE OR NOT.

23:04:20 SO I THINK THAT THE CURRENT DESIGN IS ACCEPTABLE.

23:04:26 I WOULD BE AGREEABLE TO LOOKING INTO, AS MR. LARSEN SAID,  REDUCING THE 
23:04:29 LANES BY A HALF A FOOT A PIECE AND GIVING AN ADDITIONAL FOOT TO THE BIKE 
23:04:29 LANE.

23:04:35 BUT I THINK THE CONGESTION ISSUE, IT CONTRIBUTES TO  PEOPLE'S IRRITABILITY, 
23:04:38 IF YOU WILL, WHICH IS GOING TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE ROAD RAGE, IT'S 
23:04:42 GOING TO CAUSE SOME OTHER ISSUES, IT'S GOING TO CAUSE -- ALL THE BACKUPS ARE 
23:04:47 GOING TO CAUSE A LOT MORE GREENHOUSE GASES BECAUSE OF THE IDLING VEHICLES.

23:04:54 IT TOOK ME -- AND THIS WAS  PRE-COVID -- 40 MINUTES TO GET FROM TEMPLE BETH 
23:04:58 TORAH TO THE  ON-RAMP OF WASHINGTON AND 680.

23:05:04 AND THIS WAS OBVIOUSLY BEFORE THE SUNOL GRADE EXPANSION, HOWEVER, I'VE SPOKEN 
23:05:16 TO A NUMBER OF RES DENTS SINCE THEN AND IT DOES NOT SEEM TO HAVE SLOWED DOWN 
23:05:17  SIGNIFICANTLY.

23:05:24 I MEAN, THERE HAS BEEN A REDUCTION DUE TO COVID, THERE AREN'T AS MANY CARS ON 
23:05:27 THE ROAD BUT I THINK POST COVID, WE'RE GOING TO GET ALL OF THAT TRAFFIC BACK.

23:05:35 SO I WOULD BE IN FAVOR OF OPTION 2, WITH THE RECOMMENDATION THAT WE PUT AN 
23:05:39 ACTUAL HAWK SYSTEM, WHICH IS THE PUSH THE BUTTON YOU GET A RED LIGHT INSTEAD 
23:05:43 OF THE FLASHING YELLOW BEACON AT PASEO AND OLIVE.

23:05:49 THE KIND OF UNDERLYING REASONING BEHIND THE PEOPLE SPEEDING, AND IT SEEMS TO 
23:05:54 BE FOR THE MOST PART NORTHBOUND ON PASEO PADRE, IS THEY'RE COMING OFF OF 
23:05:58 680, THEY'RE TRAVELING AT FREEWAY SPEEDS, THEY TAKE THE FREEWAY 
23:06:01 OFF-RAMP, GET ON TO PASEO PADRE, IT'S A NICE WIDE STREET AND THEY JUST KEEP 
23:06:02 THEIR FOOT DOWN.

23:06:06 IF YOU PROVIDE A BREAK IN THAT, WITH THIS HAWK SYSTEM OR EVEN A FULL 
23:06:11 TRAFFIC SIGNAL, THAT'S WARRANTED, THEN IT'S GOING TO SLOW THE TRAFFIC 
23:06:12 SIGNIFICANTLY AS FAR AS THE SPEEDING VEHICLES.

23:06:16 SO ENFORCEMENT IS A HUGE ISSUE.

23:06:24 BUT THE AVAILABILITY OF FOUR LANES TO GET THROUGH AT THIS POINT IS STILL 
23:06:28 PRETTY SIGNIFICANT, GIVEN ALL OF THE SURROUNDING SCHOOLS, GIVEN ALL OF THE 
23:06:33 TRAFFIC ON THAT ROAD, IT'S JUST GOING TO BE A NIGHTMARE IF WE REDUCE THIS TO 
23:06:33 ONE LANE EACH DIRECTION.

23:06:37 SO I WOULD BE FULLY SUPPORTIVE OF OPTION 2 WITH THE RECOMMENDATION THAT 
23:06:41 WE INSTALL A HAWK SYSTEM AT THE VERY MINIMUM AT PASEO PADRE AND OLIVE.

23:06:42 THANK YOU.

23:06:52 >> Mayor Mei: I'M GOING TO BRING BACK COUNCILMEMBER SHAO.

23:06:54 >> Councilmember Shao: THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR.

23:06:55 SORRY FOR THE TECHNICAL ISSUE.

23:06:59 I WAS GOING TO JUST MAKE MY POINT QUICKLY.

23:07:07 ANY GOOD INTENTION CHANGE MAY HAVE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES AS WHAT IS 
23:07:10 HAPPENING RIGHT IN FRONT OF MY NEIGHBORHOOD.

23:07:19 SO WITHOUT EFFICIENT DATA SO SUPPORT OPTION NUMBER 1, I WOULD ERR ON THE 
23:07:23 CAUTIOUS SIDE, AND THEN SUPPORT OPTION NUMBER 2.

23:07:31 I'M GLAD THAT THERE'S STILL A POSSIBILITY TO WIDEN THE BICYCLE PLAIN 
23:07:39 BY MAKING SOME MINOR CHANGES, AND I'M OPEN TO THAT OPTION AS ADDITION TO 
23:07:39 OPTION NUMBER 2.

23:07:44 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

23:07:45 COUNCILMEMBER KENG.

23:07:47 >> Councilmember Keng: THANK  YOU, MADAME MAYOR.

23:07:53 AND I FIRST WANT TO THANK ALL THE RESIDENTS THAT HAVE CAME TO SPEAK 
23:08:01 TONIGHT, AND I WAS ACTUALLY AT THE SESSION OF PASEO PADRE LAST YEAR 
23:08:05 BEFORE WE TOOK THAT FIRST VOTE LAST YEAR AND SPOKE TO SOME OF THE 
23:08:12 RESIDENTS THAT WANTED THAT ROAD DIET, AND YOU KNOW, I UNDERSTAND THE 
23:08:20 CONCERNS OF SAFETY, OF SPEEDING, AND I FEEL LIKE, YOU KNOW, WHAT ALL THE 
23:08:26 SURVEY THAT WE HAD DONE AND WITH 800 PEOPLE  PARTICIPATING IN THE SURVEY, I 
23:08:32 THINK IT IS -- IT WOULD BE  BETTER CONSIDERING ALL THE TRAFFIC THAT NEEDS 
23:08:43 TO PASS THROUGH TO FIRST GO WITH THE RECOMMENDATION OF THE TRAFFIC LIGHT, 
23:08:49 FLASHING BEACON, MODERNIZING TRAFFIC SIGNAL AS WELL AS PERHAPS I WOULD BE 
23:08:53 SUPPORTIVE OF THE MAYOR'S RECOMMENDATION OF HAVING THAT HAWK 
23:08:55 SIGNAL AT OLIVE.

23:09:00 THAT WILL PUT A STOP, A RED LIGHT FOR THE INCOMING TRAFFIC.

23:09:07 SO I WOULD SAY -- I DO AGREE WITH -- WHETHER WE HAVE A TWO VARIABLES AT THE 
23:09:15 SAME TIME,  HAVING A ROAD DIET AND THESE CALMING MEASURES, YOU REALLY 
23:09:16 CAN'T SAY WHICH ONE IS WORKING.

23:09:24 SO I WOULD KIND OF CAUTION, YOU KNOW, MOVING FORWARD WITH THE ROAD DIET 
23:09:30 CONCERNING THE COMMUNITY'S SUPPORT, WANTING TO KEEP THE FOUR LANES, AND I 
23:09:35 WOULD BE SUPPORTIVE OF MOVING FORWARD WITH THE OPTION NUMBER 2.

23:09:35 THANK YOU.

23:09:38 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

23:09:42 NEXT, COUNCILMEMBER COX.

23:09:50 >> Councilmember Cox: I WANTED TO ECHO AND I FIRST WANTED TO SAY MY HEART 
23:09:55 GOES OUT TO ANY OF OUR FAMILY MEMBERS OUT THERE THAT HAVE HAD CHILDREN OR 
23:10:01 FAMILY MEMBERS THAT HAVE GOTTEN HURT OR KILLED, AND I WAS REALLY TOUCHED BY 
23:10:09 THAT ONE SPEAKER, SANTIA, THAT TALKED ABOUT HIS DAUGHTER WAS KILLED ON PASEO 
23:10:09 PADRE.

23:10:15 SO I'M TAKING MY HAT OFF AND SPEAKING AS SOMEONE ALSO AS A MOTHER OF 
23:10:16 CHILDREN.

23:10:25 AND ALSO LOOKING IN TERMS OF HAVING KIDS THAT HAVE GONE AROUND TO THOSE 
23:10:32 SCHOOLS AND ALSO FRIENDS, FAMILY THAT LIVE RIGHT AROUND THE PASEO PADRE.

23:10:39 I'VE ALSO TALKED WITH SOME OF THE BIKERS AND OUR BIKER COMMUNITY, AND 
23:10:49 YOU KNOW, YOU'RE TRYING TO FIND A BALANCE, A COMPROMISE, BUT SAFETY AND  
23:10:51 TRYING TO SAVE LIVES IS THE TOP PRIORITY.

23:10:55 WHEN WE LOOK AT TRANSPORTATION GOALS.

23:11:01 AND SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I THINK IS IMPORTANT IS THAT WE START WITH 
23:11:07 SOME OF THE THINGS WILL THAT ARE EASY TO ADD IN TO SLOW THE TRAFFIC DOWN.

23:11:16 SUCH AS THE TRAFFIC SIGNALS  AT -- DRIVE, ADDING IN THE BEACON -- 
23:11:19 FLASHING BEACONS, I THINK THAT WOULD BE IMPORTANT.

23:11:25 LOOKING AT IF WE CAN ADD TO THREE OF THOSE STREETS, THAT WOULD BE GREAT TO 
23:11:29 HELP SLOW DOWN THE TRAFFIC, BUT ALSO MAKING IT VERY VISIBLE WHEN 
23:11:29 PEDESTRIANS NEED TO CROSS.

23:11:40 AND JUST THE WHOLE PART OF MODERNIZING, MAKING MODERN OUR TRAFFIC SIGNAL 
23:11:44 TECHNOLOGY, I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE THAT HE CAN ADD A LOT MORE OF 
23:11:50 HOW WE CAN MANAGE TRAFFIC AND CHANGE IT UP LIVE IN THE  PROCESS, WITH OUR 
23:11:52 TRAFFIC LIGHTS BEING OVER, I THINK, 40 YEARS OLD.

23:12:03 I THINK THE INPUT FROM THE COMMUNITY THAT HAS COME VERY STRONGLY FOR 
23:12:10 VOICING WITH 800 RESPONSES THAT THE MAJORITY ARE FEELING THAT WE SHOULD 
23:12:16 NOT REDUCE THE LANES AND I THINK THAT WOULD BE THE FIRST PHASE, IS TO 
23:12:23 SUPPORT OPTION TWO, BUT AT THE SAME TIME, WE CAN MAKE IT OPTION 2A AND A 
23:12:31 PART WOULD BE ABLE TO WIDEN THE BIKE LANE TO MAKE IT MORE SAFER INSTEAD OF 
23:12:36 THE STANDARD 3 OR 4 FEET THAT WAS MENTIONED EARLIER.

23:12:44 AND THEN ALSO THAT THE ROADS WILL STILL BE WITHIN 9 1/2 FEET WIDE TO STILL 
23:12:52 MAINTAIN TWO LANES INTO FOUR LANES -- I'M SORRY, FOUR LANES IN TOTAL ON 
23:12:59 PASEO PADRE, I THINK OPTION 2 WITH THE OPTION A ADD-ON WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL, 
23:13:02 AND IF WE CAN AFFORD THE ADDITIONAL RED LIGHTS, THAT WOULD HELP IN BEING MORE 
23:13:10 VISIBLE TO STOP, THAT WOULD BE A WIN, BUT TRYING TO SEE HOW WE CAN PHASE IN, 
23:13:15 MAKING IT A WIN-WIN FOR THE BICYCLISTS, FOR THOSE THAT ARE ALSO MOTORISTS 
23:13:19 DRIVING THROUGH PASEO PADRE.

23:13:23 SO OPTION 2 WITH THE A WITH THE TWIST.

23:13:32 >> Mayor Mei: NEXT, VICE MAYOR SALWAN, DID YOU ALREADY --

23:13:34 >> Councilmember Kassan: I KEPT GETTING KICKED OFF.

23:13:36 >> Mayor Mei: THAT'S WHY I WAS GOING TO ASK THAT.

23:13:40 THANK YOU, COUNCILMEMBER KA SAFNLT I SAW YOUR HAND WAS UP NEXT BUT FOR SOME 
23:13:42 REASON NOW RAJ IS FURTHER UP.

23:13:45 >> Councilmember Kassan: I'M HAVING INTERNET ISSUES SO I KEEP HAVING TO 
23:13:46 RE-RAISE MY HAND.

23:13:48 SO IT DOES SOUND LIKE --

23:13:52 >> Mayor Mei: CAN I RECOMMEND, COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, IN CASE YOUR 
23:13:55 BROADBAND IS HAVING PROBLEMS YOU MIGHT WANT TO TURN OFF YOUR SCREEN BECAUSE I 
23:13:59 SEE THAT IT SAYS ON HERE THAT YOUR BROADBAND IS HAVING SOME DIFFICULTIES.

23:14:01 THAT'S WHY I WAS JUST WONDERING.

23:14:01 THANK YOU.

23:14:02 >> Councilmember Kassan: OKAY.

23:14:06 I'LL KEEP IT SHORT BECAUSE IT DOES SOUND LIKE WE DON'T HAVE A MAJORITY TO 
23:14:08 GO FOR STAFF RECOMMENDATION.

23:14:12 I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT THE  OLDEST -- THE PERSON WHO HAS PRACTICED TRAFFIC 
23:14:19 ENGINEERING LONGEST IN OUR STATE THINKS THAT WE SHOULD REDUCE THE LANES TO ONE 
23:14:21 IN EACH DIRECTION.

23:14:24 OBVIOUSLY THAT'S NOT GOING TO SWAY ANYONE.

23:14:28 MY DAD AND I DISAGREE ON A LOT OF THINGS BUT HE DID LOOK AT THIS AND HE 
23:14:33 AGREES WITH STAFF RECOMMENDATION, SO I JUST WANTED TO THROW THAT IN THERE.

23:14:37 HE'S BEEN PRACTICING FOR MANY, MANY, MANY DECADES AND HE THINKS THAT 
23:14:39 THERE'S NO REASON NOT TO GO WITH THE ROAD DIET.

23:14:44 SO IT MAKE ME REALLY SAD TO SEE THAT THAT'S PROBABLY NOT GOING TO HAPPEN, 
23:14:47 AND YOU KNOW, I DON'T REALLY HAVE ANYTHING ELSE TO  SAY.

23:14:47 THANK YOU.

23:14:51 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

23:14:53 COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN.

23:14:57 AND THEN I JUST WANTED TO REMIND PEOPLE THAT I ORIGINALLY SAID IN THE 
23:15:00 BEGINNING OF THE MEETING WE WILL GO UP UNTIL 11:30 UNLESS WE NEED TODAY HAVE 
23:15:05 AN EXTENSION, AND SO I THINK WE DO HAVE SOME CONSENSUS IN TERMS OF THE 
23:15:08 PROPOSAL OF OPTION 2 WITH ADDING THE HAWK.

23:15:12 WE HAD ALREADY TALKED ABOUT MODERNIZING, THAT'S PART OF ANOTHER 
23:15:12 OVERALL PLAN.

23:15:20 I WASN'T SURE IF THERE WAS ANOTHER PIECE I'M MISSING, BUT COUNCILMEMBER 
23:15:21 JONES ACTUALLY NOW.

23:15:22 I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO VM SALWAN.

23:15:25 BUT COUNCILMEMBER JONES, WOULD YOU LIKE TO MAKE A MOTION?

23:15:29 >> Councilmember Jones: VICE MAYOR SALWAN WAS UP, SO I DON'T KNOW IF HE 
23:15:30 WANTED TO DO THAT.

23:15:32 >> Vice Mayor Salwan: NO  WORRIES.

23:15:32 IT'S YOU A GOOD.

23:15:36 I MEAN, YEAH, I WOULD LIKE TO GO AHEAD AND MAKE THE MOTION.

23:15:41 I THINK WE'LL DEFINITELY INCREASE THE SAFETY FROM WHERE WE ARE NOW.

23:15:45 AND OPTION 2 SEEMS TO HAVE CONSENSUS.

23:15:46 SO LET'S GO AHEAD WITH TA.

23:15:52  AWITH THAT, AND LET'S LOOK AT MR. LARSEN'S SUGGESTION OF INCREASING THE 
23:15:54 BIKE LANE IF POSSIBLE TO 5 FEET.

23:16:01 AS WELL AS MAYOR MEI'S SUGGESTION TO ADD THE HAWK SIGNAL OR WHATEVER YOU 
23:16:10 CALL IT AND ABOVE, THAT WOULD BE A  BONUS, AND ANY OTHER WAYS TO REDUCE 
23:16:11 TRAFFIC.

23:16:15 >> Mayor Mei: VICE MAYOR SALWAN, I ALSO WANTED TO NOTE, I THINK COUNCILMEMBER 
23:16:16 COX HAD ONE OTHER AMENDMENT TOO.

23:16:20 I WASN'T SURE IF IT'S IN ADDITION TO THE ONES WE'VE ALREADY LISTED.

23:16:24 >> Councilmember Cox: IT WAS ALSO ADDING THE FLASHING BEACON LIGHTS AT 
23:16:24 THREE STREETS, NOT TWO.

23:16:31 >> Mayor Mei: SO I DON'T  THINK -- JUST TO LET YOU KNOW, THE FLASHING BEACON, 
23:16:36 I THINK IS THE ONE THAT'S, FOR EXAMPLE, IN FRONT OF HOPKINS RIGHT NOW, THE 
23:16:36 HAWK IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT.

23:16:40 IT'S THE ONE THAT YOU SEE IN UNION CITY ON THE BORDER WHEN YOU CROSS.

23:16:46 >> Councilmember Cox: IT'S WITH THE HAWK.

23:16:48 >> Mayor Mei: ON ALL THREE?

23:16:50 >> Councilmember Cox: YES.

23:16:56 >> Vice Mayor Salwan: THAT  FLASHING AT DORN, MENTOAND  OLIVE.

23:17:00 >> Councilmember Cox: RIGHT, SO ARE YOU SAYING -- JUST TO CLARIFY, ARE WE 
23:17:03 WANTING TO HAVE A HAWK AT THREE STREETS, TWO STREETS OR JUST OLIVE 
23:17:03 AVENUE?

23:17:11 >> Vice Mayor Salwan: I ASSUME THERE'S AN EXPENSE --

23:17:12 >> Mayor Mei: THERE IS CONSIDERABLE EXPENSE.

23:17:17 I WAS THINKING ORIGINALLY OLIVE BECAUSE THAT IS THE ONE PEOPLE CROSS GETTING 
23:17:22 TO HOPKINS, ONE OF THE OPTIONS FOR HOPKINS UNLESS YOU CROSS AT THE MAJOR 
23:17:25 INTERSECTION OF PASEO PADRE AND DRISCOLL ITSELF, AND THEN HAVING THE 
23:17:30 OTHER TWO BEING FLASHING BEACONS AND DIRECTOR LARSEN, WOULD YOU YOU LIKE TO 
23:17:30 COMMENT?

23:17:33 THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT PRICETAG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THOSE.

23:17:37 >> City Mgr. Shackelford: HANS, CAN YOU BRING UP THE SLIDE THAT SHOWS THE 
23:17:40 STREET AND WHERE THE VARIOUS OPTIONS WOULD BE  INSTALLED?

23:17:41 THANK YOU.

23:17:43 >> THERE YOU GO.

23:17:51 SO YES, MAYOR MEI AND COUNCIL, WHAT I'M HEARING IS PREFERENCE FOR OPTION 2, 
23:17:56 WE'LL CALL I GUESS 2A, SO 2 WITH MODIFICATIONS, SO WORKING TO GET A 
23:18:04 5-FOOT BIKE LANE IN THERE, AND THEN HAVING CROSSING PROTECTION REALLY AT 
23:18:11 ALL THREE LOCATIONS, SO IT SOUNDS LIKE DORN FLASHING BEACON IS WHAT WE 
23:18:13 RECOMMENDED, WE HAVE THE SIGNAL AT COVINGTON.

23:18:24 WE WERE PROPOSING A FLASHING BEACON AT MENTO OR OLIVE, BUT I WOULD SAY IF 
23:18:27 WE'RE GOING WITH OPTION 2 AND KEEPING FOUR LANES IN THERE, THEN THERE'S A 
23:18:32 GREATER NEED FOR ADDED KIND OF SAFETY PROTECTION IN THE CORRIDOR, AND SO 
23:18:38 WHAT I'M HEARING FROM COUNCIL DIRECTION AND IF YOU'D ALLOW US KIND OF THE 
23:18:43 DISCRETION TO LOOK AT THIS AND OPTIMIZE IT, BUT I'M HEARING AND I THINK THAT 
23:18:48 THERE'S -- I AGREE WITH THE LOGIC TO IT, IS HAVING SOMETHING THAT IS A MORE 
23:18:54 FULL STOP AT OLIVE, SO A HAWK SIGNAL IS BASICALLY A PEDESTRIAN WANTS TO CROSS, 
23:18:59 YOU GET A RED STOP AS OPPOSED TO JUST THE FLASHING BEACON AND HAVING THAT AS 
23:19:03 KIND OF THE GATEWAY INTO THE  CORRIDOR, UNDERSTAND THE LOGIC OF THAT, AND 
23:19:10 GIVEN THAT WE ALREADY HAVE AN EXISTING CROSSWALK AND A SCHOOL CROSSING 
23:19:15 PATTERN AT MENTO, THERE'S BENEFIT TO HAVING SOMETHING THERE AS WELL.

23:19:20 SO I THINK WE'RE LOOKING AT -- THE RECOMMENDATION IS TO LOOK AT A HAWK AT 
23:19:25 OLIVE, MAYBE A SIGNAL, SO I THINK EACH OF THESE KIND OF GET MORE AND MORE 
23:19:30 EXPENSIVE, BUT I THINK GIVEN THE FOUR-LANE CHARACTERISTIC OF THE 
23:19:34 ROADWAY, HOW CAN WE INTRODUCE OTHER THINGS TO MAKE IT AS SAFE AS POSSIBLE.

23:19:39 THAT'S THE DIRECTION WE'LL TAKE WITH A PREFERENCE FOR A HAWK, FLASHING 
23:19:44 BEACON, TRAFFIC SIGNAL, FLASHING BEACON, AS WELL AS SIGNAL 
23:19:47 MODERNIZATION AT THE MAJOR INTERSECTIONS.

23:19:51 >> Councilmember Jones: MADAME MAYOR, QUICK QUESTION.

23:19:52 >> Mayor Mei: SURE.

23:19:53 THANK YOU.

23:19:58 >> Councilmember Jones: MR. LARS EN, WE CURRENTLY HAVE A HAWK AT MOWRY AND 
23:20:00 BART, IS THAT CORRECT?

23:20:05 >> MOWRY AND WATERSIDE IS A HAWK SIGNAL, SO YEAH, THAT'S NEAR THE BART 
23:20:06 STATION IN CENTRAL FREMONT.

23:20:08 >> Councilmember Jones: THANK YOU.

23:20:15 >> Mr. Larsen: WE DO HAVE AT LEAST ONE OR TWO OTHERS AND I'M DRAWING A BLANK 
23:20:16 ON WHERE THOSE ARE AT.

23:20:24 WE DO HAVE A HAWK THAT'S PROPOSED ON FREMONT BOULEVARD AT BONDE IN 
23:20:28 CENTERVILLE, SO THAT'S PART OF THE RECENT COUNCIL ACTION TO IMPROVE 
23:20:29 SAFETY IN THAT CORRIDOR.

23:20:32 SO WE'LL SEE MORE OF THEM, UNION CITY HAS SOME.

23:20:41 IT'S A HIGHER LEVEL OF PEDESTRIAN CROSSING PROTECTION THAN A FLASHING 
23:20:41 BEACON.

23:20:45 >> Mayor Mei: IT COMES A RED LIGHT.

23:20:49 >> Vice Mayor Salwan: OKAY, SO I MOVE MR. LARSEN'S TRADITIONS.

23:20:54 >> Councilmember Cox: CAN WE SUMMARIZE IT ONE MORE TIME TO MAKE SURE 
23:20:54 EVERYBODY IS CLEAR?

23:21:01 I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE WE HEARD NEW TRAFFIC SIGNAL AT COVINGTON DRIVE, 
23:21:09 PEDESTRIAN FLASHING BEACONS AT DORNE AND MENTO, AT OLIVE AVENUE, WE HAVE A 
23:21:16 HAWK, AND THEN MODERNIZING THE EXISTING TRAFFIC SIGNALS AT DRISCOLL AND AT 
23:21:17 WASHINGTON BOULEVARD.

23:21:19 DID I GET THAT RIGHT?

23:21:26 >> Mr. Larsen: THE OTHER  THING --

23:21:29 >> Councilmember Cox: AND THEN CHANGE THE BIKE LANE TO 5 FEET AND 9 1/2 FEET 
23:21:30 FOR THE OTHER LANES.

23:21:35 >> City Mgr. Shackelford: UNLESS OF COURSE WE CAN DO SOMETHING WITH THE 
23:21:38 MEDIAN THERE AND MAINTAIN THE 10-FOOT BIKE LANE.

23:21:40 SO WE'LL LOOK INTO THAT AS WELL.

23:21:41 >> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.

23:21:45 I THINK WE CAPTURED IT ALL.

23:21:46 >> Vice Mayor Salwan: I MOVE THAT.

23:21:47 DO WE HAVE A SECOND?

23:21:48 >> Councilmember Jones: SECOND.

23:21:50 >> Councilmember Cox: SECOND.

23:21:53 >> Mayor Mei: MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN, SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER JONES.

23:21:55 ROLL CALL, PLEASE.

23:21:59 >> Ms. Gauthier: COUNCILMEMBER COX, AYE.

23:22:01 COUNCILMEMBER SHAO, AYE.

23:22:06 COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, NO, AND COULD YOU PLEASE NOTE THAT MY NO IS BECAUSE I 
23:22:07 SUPPORT STAFF RECOMMENDATION?

23:22:10 IN THE MINUTES.

23:22:10 THANK YOU.

23:22:14 >> Ms. Gauthier: WILL DO, COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN.

23:22:22 COUNCILMEMBER JONES, AYE.

23:22:24 COUNCILMEMBER KENG, AYE.

23:22:27 VICE MAYOR SALWAN, AYE.

23:22:30 MAYOR MEI, AYE.

23:22:36 >> Mayor Mei: THE MOTION PASSES WITH SIX VOTING, AND NOTED ALSO 
23:22:41 COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, THE NAY IS IN DEFERENCE TO THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION.

23:22:43 >> Ms. Gauthier: RIGHT.

23:22:45 I'LL NOTE THE REASON FOR THE OBJECTION.

23:22:46 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

23:22:56 NEXT IS THE COUNCIL REFERRAL FROM COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN  REGARDING INPUT 
23:22:59 FROM THE COMMISSION FOR MAJOR ROAD PROJECTS.

23:23:07 AND I AM GOING TO LET COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN -- I THINK WE HAD THIS 
23:23:09 DISCUSSION LAST WEEK, BUT I AM SUPPORTIVE OF THE REFERRAL.

23:23:14 ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS FROM COUNCILMEMBERS?

23:23:34 I SEE A QUESTION, I'M GOING TO OPEN UP FOR PUBLIC COMMENT, FROM ANDREAS KA 
23:23:36 DAF NICHE.

23:23:41 >> FOLLOWING UP ON LAST WEEK'S DISCUSSION, I WANTED TO POINT OUT A 
23:23:41 FEW THINGS.

23:23:47 THE -- COMMISSION MEETS MONTHLY, THE MOBILITY COMMISSION MEETS QUARTERLY.

23:23:49 OUR ROADS KILL FOUR PEOPLE A YEAR.

23:23:54 OUR PARKS DON'T DO THAT.

23:23:59 IT IS BEYOND ME WHY WE DON'T UTILIZE THE MOBILITY COMMISSION MORE TO 
23:24:00 ADDRESS THESE ISSUES.

23:24:02 AND GET PUBLIC INPUT.

23:24:07 BECAUSE IT'S ACTUALLY IN THE CHARTER THAT ESTABLISHES THE MOBILITY 
23:24:12 COMMISSION THAT IT EXISTS TO GET PUBLIC INPUT ON ISSUES THAT RELATE TO TRAFFIC 
23:24:17 AND MOBILITY LIKE THE ONE WE JUST DISCUSSED, AND YOU COULD HAVE SAVED 
23:24:21 YOURSELF A LOT OF THE DISCUSSION IF YOU HAD GOTTEN THE REFERRAL, A 
23:24:23 RECOMMENDATION FROM THE MOBILITY COMMISSION IN MY REVIEW.

23:24:29 AND AGAIN, WHEN I WAS ON THE BICYCLE PEDESTRIAN TECHNICAL COMMITTEE, WE 
23:24:33 WERE ALWAYS CLAMORING FOR MORE MEETINGS BECAUSE THERE WAS SO MUCH WORK TO BE 
23:24:36 DONE, AND WE HAD SO MANY PEOPLE FROM THE PUBLIC ATTENDING AND JUST LIKE YOU 
23:24:39 SAW TODAY, THESE ISSUES REALLY MATTER TO A LOT OF PEOPLE.

23:24:45 SO REALLY, YOU SHOULD BE UTILIZING MOBILITY COMMISSION MORE, AND THEY'RE 
23:24:46 QUITE GOOD AT IT.

23:24:52 AND YOU FORMED THAT COMMISSION FOR THAT EXACT PURPOSE, SO PLEASE, MAKE GOOD 
23:24:53 USE OF IT.

23:24:53 THANK YOU.

23:24:57 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

23:25:05 SEEING NO OTHER PUBLIC COMMENT AT THIS TIME, I'M GOING TO -- OKAY.

23:25:07 GOPAL?

23:25:15 I WAS GOING TO CLOSE IT, BUT  GOPAL, IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK.

23:25:17 >> SORRY TO GET ON IN THE LAST MOMENT.

23:25:22 I THINK IN TERMS OF SEEKING INPUT, I THINK WHAT WE'VE DONE THIS TIME IS 
23:25:25 GOOD, THE SURVEY WAS PUBLISHED ON THE CITY'S WEBSITE, AS LONG AS WE CAN MAKE 
23:25:31 PEOPLE AWARE THAT SUCH A SURVEY EXIST, THIS IS WHAT I WOULD SUPPORT.

23:25:38 USUALLY ANY COMMISSION OR TASK FORCE YOU TALK ABOUT TENDS TO HAVE PEOPLE 
23:25:44 WITH CERTAIN VESTED INTERESTS, AND I WOULD REALLY NOT BE COMFORTABLE WITH 
23:25:45 SURVEYS THAT ARE CONDUCTED BY THEM.

23:25:45 THANK YOU.

23:25:49 >> Mayor Mei: OKAY.

23:25:52 WELL, THERE IS JUST -- SINCE I'M NOTING, I WILL NOTE THERE'S TWO 
23:25:56 POSITIONS OPEN ON THE  COMMISSION.

23:26:01 AND AGAIN, WE HAVE A HARD STOP AT 11:30 UNLESS WE'RE VOTING TO EXTEND IT.

23:26:03 FLAVIO?

23:26:05 >> OKAY.

23:26:06 I'LL KEEP IT VERY BRIEF.

23:26:10 I JUST WANTED TO EXPRESS MY SUPPORT FOR THIS REFERRAL THAT WAS MADE BY 
23:26:10 COUNCILMEMBER  KASSAN.

23:26:12 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

23:26:25 NEXT IS PURUSHOTHAM PEDDIREDDY.

23:26:26 I GUESS YOUR WIFE JUST SPOKE.

23:26:28 SORRY.

23:26:29 >> GOOD EVENING.

23:26:39 SO I SUPPORT THE MOBILITY COMMISSION HAVING MORE POWER, THINK WE NEED TO 
23:26:43 LOOK FOR THAT, NOT LIKE THE SURVEYS ON THE EMAILS WHERE BASICALLY THEY CAN 
23:26:50 GET BOTCHED UP EASILY AND THOSE EMAILS, WHO'S LIVING THERE,  WHO'S NOT LIVING 
23:26:58 THERE, -- AND THEN WE ARE ALWAYS GOING TO -- WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE 
23:27:04 SCIENTIFIC DATA AND THEN WE NEED TO -- ACCORDINGLY AND ALSO WE NEED TO -- 
23:27:06 OPINION OF THE PEOPLE THAT MATTERS.

23:27:13 NOT WITH EMAILS AND -- THE CITY COMMISSION, THE CITY STAFF THINK 
23:27:17 BASICALLY HOW THE CAMPAIGNS ARE GOING, JUST AUTOMATED THINGS.

23:27:23 SO IT IS NECESSARY EVEN IF YOU CONDUCT SURVEY, THEY NEED TO BE VALIDATED WITH 
23:27:32 THE RIGHT INFORMATION, NOT LIKE SURVEYS THAT GO THROUGH THE EMAIL AND -- GOOD 
23:27:32 ENOUGH FOR YOU.

23:27:37 SO WE NEED TO VALIDATE THE SURVEYS.

23:27:41 >> Mayor Mei: I'M SORRY, THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE A MINUTE AND A HALF, SO 
23:27:42 -- MY APOLOGIES.

23:27:44 I THINK I WANT TO BE CONSISTENT WITH ALL THE SPEAKERS.

23:27:45 >> SURE.

23:27:50 >> Mayor Mei: I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THE OTHER TWO ARE A MINUTE AND A HALF.

23:27:52 I KNOW ORIGINALLY WE STARTED WITH THAT.

23:28:03 JANIT SHARMA FOLLOWED BY  MANJUNATH SHANKAR.

23:28:05 >> I WANTED TO ADD MORE TO WHAT HE MENTIONED.

23:28:10 WHO IS LIVING ON PASEO PADRE, HOW ARE WE GOING TO VALIDATE --

23:28:12 >> Mayor Mei: I JUST WANTED TO CONFIRM THAT YOU'RE SPEAKING RELATED TO THIS 
23:28:15 ITEM, WHICH IS THE REFERRAL, NOT THE PREVIOUS ITEM THAT WAS ALREADY VOTED.

23:28:17 SO I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE OF THAT.

23:28:17 SORRY.

23:28:19 >> OKAY, THANK YOU.

23:28:29 >> Mayor Mei: YOU ARE  SPEAKING -- OKAY.

23:28:40 MANJUN ATH SHANKAR, THIS IS RELATED TO THE REFERRAL FROM COUNCILMEMBER 
23:28:40 KASSAN.

23:28:43 >> IN MY OPINION, COMMUNITY INPUT SHOULD BE A SIGNIFICANT PART OF 
23:28:46 DECISION-MAKING IN ADDITION TO THE COMMITTEES THAT GET CREATED.

23:28:53 AND THE MORE WE DO IT, I THINK THE DECISION-MAKING IS MORE ACCEPTABLE TO 
23:28:53 THE COMMUNITY AS WELL.

23:28:54 THANK YOU.

23:29:00 >> Mayor Mei: JUST TO CLARIFY, WE'RE GOING TO BRING IT BACK TO THE COUNCIL 
23:29:04 BECAUSE WE HAVE A HARD STOP AT 11:30 UNLESS WE EXTEND IT, I'LL GIVE ANOTHER 
23:29:07 FIVE MINUTES OR 10 MINUTES, WHAT'S NEEDED TO FINISH THIS ITEM, BUT I KNOW 
23:29:09 WE HAVE ALSO THE STENOCAPTIONER.

23:29:15 SO I'M GOING TO GO BACK TO OUR COUNCIL, I DON'T KNOW IF COUNCILMEMBER JONES 
23:29:18 YOU WOULD LIKE TO SHARE ABOUT YOUR OPINION ON THIS REFERRAL.

23:29:21 >> Councilmember Jones: ACTUALLY I HAD A QUICK QUESTION.

23:29:27 COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, COULD YOU JUST CLARIFY EXACTLY WHAT IT IS, IF IT IS 
23:29:29 IN ADDITION TO WHAT STAFF IS DOING NOW?

23:29:34 YOU KNOW, WE HAD THIS DISCUSSION LAST WEEK REGARDING THESE MAJOR PROJECTS 
23:29:39 COME UP A NUMBER OF MONTHS AHEAD OF TIME AND THERE IS OPPORTUNITY FOR THE 
23:29:41 MOBILITY COMMISSION AND OTHERS TO PROVIDE THEIR INPUT.

23:29:44 IS THERE SOMETHING DIFFERENT THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE?

23:29:48 I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT LEVEL OF STAFF PARTICIPATION THERE 
23:29:49 NEEDS TO BE.

23:29:54 >> Councilmember Kassan: YEAH, I MEAN, I THOUGHT WE DID KIND OF GO OVER THIS 
23:30:00 LAST TIME, BUT I AM ASKING THAT THERE BE A PROCESS TO GET INPUT FROM THE 
23:30:08 COMMISSION ON MAJOR ROAD PROJECTS AND A STRAW POLL AND MEETING MINUTES TAKEN 
23:30:09 OF THE INPUT.

23:30:13 WE WERE TOLD THAT THAT HASN'T BEEN HAPPENING AND THE REASON -- THE ONLY 
23:30:18 REASON I HEARD THAT IT WASN'T HAPPENING IS BECAUSE THEY DON'T -- BECAUSE THEY 
23:30:23 ONLY MEET QUARTERLY AND IT MIGHT BE HARD TO GET PEOPLE TO SERVE IF THEY 
23:30:24 HAVE TO HAVE MORE MEETINGS.

23:30:27 THAT WAS THE ONLY REASON I HEARD WHY THAT ISN'T HAPPENING.

23:30:30 SO IT IS CONFUSING TO ME WHY THIS SHOULD BE SO CONTROVERSIAL.

23:30:34 I WOULD THINK WE WOULD WANT THIS INFORMATION, BUT YES, IT'S ABSOLUTELY 
23:30:37 BEYOND WHAT IS CURRENTLY BEING DONE AS WE DISCUSSED AT THE LAST MEETING.

23:30:40 >> Councilmember Jones: OKAY.

23:30:45 SO BASICALLY A REPORT OUT FROM THE MOBILITY COMMISSION ON ANY MAJOR 
23:30:46 PROJECTS THAT ARE COMING FORWARD.

23:30:48 IS THAT CORRECT?

23:30:50 >> Councilmember Kassan: YES.

23:30:54 >> Mayor Mei: I'M GUESSING IT'S SIMILAR TO LIKE HOW WE HAVE PLANNING 
23:30:57 COMMISSION REVIEW SOMETIMES BEFORE THEY COME TO THE COUNCIL.

23:31:01 IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE ASKING FOR A SIMILAR -- NOT EVERY PROJECT BUT MAJOR 
23:31:03 --

23:31:04 >> Councilmember Kassan: YEAH, IT IS DIFFERENT, THOUGH, BECAUSE THE 
23:31:07 PLANNING COMMISSION ACTUALLY DOES VOTE AND I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT A VOTE, I'M 
23:31:11 JUST TALKING ABOUT A STRAW POLL AND MINUTES OF THE INPUT.

23:31:16 AS PART OF THE PROCESS FOR MAKING THESE KINDS OF MAJOR DECISIONS ABOUT ROADS 
23:31:20 LIKE WHAT WE DID TONIGHT AND WHAT WE DID ABOUT FREMONT BOULEVARD IN 
23:31:21 CENTERVILLE.

23:31:25 >> Mayor Mei: I'M SUPPORTIVE OF THE STAFF LOOKING AT THAT AND BRINGING IT 
23:31:25 BACK.

23:31:26 COUNCILMEMBER SHAO.

23:31:29 AND THEN WE HAVE A HARD STOP SO WE NEED TO BE REALLY QUICK.

23:31:30 SORRY ABOUT THAT.

23:31:30 >> Councilmember Shao: CERTAINLY .

23:31:38 I ALSO WOULD LIKE COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN TO CLARIFY WHY COMMITTEES SUCH AS 
23:31:46 PARKS AND RECREATION  ARE, YOU KNOW, LEFT OUT IN YOUR REFERRAL.

23:31:57 TO ME, MAJOR ROAD WOULD NOT ONLY IMPACT THE SENIOR COMMUNITY BUT IT WOULD HAVE 
23:31:59 A LOT OF IMPACT ON MANY ASPECTS.

23:32:17  CASS I'M SORRY, DID YOU FINISH WHAT YOU WERE SAYING?

23:32:19 I FEEL LIKE I MISSED.

23:32:22 YOU'RE ASKING WHY I DIDN'T INCLUDE PARKS AND REC.?

23:32:25 BECAUSE I DON'T SEE A DIRECT REASON TO INCLUDE PARKS AND  REC., BUT IF YOU -- 
23:32:32 I MEAN, TO ME, THE IMPORTANT THING, MOBILITY OBVIOUSLY HAS A VERY 
23:32:37 IMPORTANT ROLE TO PLAY IN ROADS, AND THEN SENIOR, I KNOW THAT COUNCILMEMBER 
23:32:43 COX HAD MENTIONED THAT SHE HAD SPOKEN TO SOME PEOPLE THAT WERE INVOLVED IN 
23:32:45 THE SENIOR COMMISSION THAT SPECIFICALLY HAD CONCERNS THAT THEY DIDN'T GET TO 
23:32:50 HAVE INPUT ON THE PASEO PADRE CONVERSATION,  SO -- AND, YOU KNOW, 
23:32:55 SENIORS ARE PEOPLE WHO OFTEN NEED TO BE ABLE TO HAVE ALTERNATIVES TO DRIVING.

23:32:59 SO THOSE ARE THE TWO THAT I THOUGHT WERE IMPORTANT, BUT IF YOU WANT TO ADD 
23:33:00 OTHERS, YOU KNOW, FEEL FREE.

23:33:03 I'M OPEN TO FRIENDLY AMENDMENTS.

23:33:06 >> Councilmember Shao: THANK  YOU.

23:33:10 >> Mayor Mei: VICE MAYOR SALWAN, YOU HAD YOUR HAND RAISED?

23:33:14 >> Vice Mayor Salwan: REAL QUICKLY, WHILE I UNDERSTAND COUNCILMEMBER 
23:33:21  SHAO'S POINT, FOR EXAMPLE, YOUTH, WE WANT TO GET THE YOUTH FEEDBACK, WHAT 
23:33:24 DO THEY THINK, PLANNING COMMISSION, THEY MAKE DECISIONS ON PROJECTS, 
23:33:25 WASN'T TO GET THEIR FEEDBACK.

23:33:30 SO WE HAVE SO MANY COMMISSION, SO I THINK UNLESS WE JUST WANTED JUST THE 
23:33:34 MOBILITY, IF WE'RE GOING TO OPEN IT UP TO SENIOR, WHY NOT THE YOUTH, WHY NOT 
23:33:35 THE LIBRARY, WHY NOT OTHERS AS WELL.

23:33:37 SO I THINK THAT'S KIND OF THE TRADEOFF.

23:33:43 BUT I THINK FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND, STAFF IS WILLING TO DO THIS, SO I 
23:33:46 THINK -- I DON'T KNOW, MS. SHACKELFORD, IF YOU WANT TO ADDRESS THAT.

23:33:49 >> Councilmember Kassan: WE WERE TOLD THAT THEY WERE NOT.

23:33:51 SO THAT'S WHY I MADE THE REFERRAL.

23:33:55 >> Mayor Mei: I'D LIKE THE CITY MANAGER TO SPEAK BEFORE WE MAKE THE VOTE.

23:33:57 SHE CAN CLARIFY.

23:34:07 >> City Mgr. Shackelford: YEAH, NO, I THINK -- WHERE DO I BEGIN?

23:34:11 I THINK STAFF EXPRESSED LAST WEEK, I EXPRESSED LAST WEEK THAT WE WOULD BE 
23:34:17 WILLING TO GAIN THE INPUT FROM THE VARIOUS COMMISSIONS, ALL OF THE 
23:34:25 COMMISSIONS, AND DO MORE  OUTREACH TO THE COMMISSIONS WITHOUT NECESSARILY 
23:34:27 HAVING SUCH A REFERRAL.

23:34:32 I ALSO EXPRESSED THAT BY ONLY INCLUDING, YOU KNOW, ONE OR TWO 
23:34:39 COMMISSIONS, IT COULD POTENTIALLY BE A SLIPPERY SLOPE AS WE'VE HEARD HERE 
23:34:42 THIS  EVENING, WHY NOT THIS COMMISSION OR WHY NOT THAT COMMISSION.

23:34:49 SO YOU KNOW, REFERRALS ARE A TWO-STEP PROCESS, SO WE'RE AT THE FIRST STEP 
23:34:51 RIGHT NOW.

23:34:59 WHICH IS DIRECTING STAFF, IF YOU ALL AGREE TO IT, DIRECTING US TO REVIEW 
23:35:06 AND PROVIDE INPUT ON AT LEAST THE TWO COMMISSIONS NOTED HERE, THE MOBILITY 
23:35:10 COMMISSION AND THE SENIOR COMMISSION, PROVIDING INPUT ON MAJOR 
23:35:12 TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS.

23:35:19 THE NEXT STEP, IF YOU ALL, AGAIN, AGREE TO THIS REFERRAL IS THAT STAFF WOULD 
23:35:26 GO AND DO RESEARCH AND BEST PRACTICES, WE'D REVIEW THE CHARTER OF THE CURRENT 
23:35:31 COMMISSIONS TO MAKE SURE WE DON'T NEED TO MAKE ANY CHANGES THERE TO THE 
23:35:39 MUNICIPAL CODE AND ALL OF THAT, AND THEN COME BACK TO YOU WITH AN ANALYSIS 
23:35:42 OF THE RESEARCH THAT WE'VE DONE SO YOU ALL CAN DECIDE IF YOU INDEED WANT US 
23:35:43 TO GO DOWN THIS PATH.

23:35:51 BUT AGAIN, THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I THINK GETTING INPUT FROM THE 
23:35:54 COMMISSION, AND WE'VE HEARD FROM A COUPLE MEMBERS FROM THE MOBILITY 
23:36:00 COMMISSION THIS  EVENING, THAT THEY HAD PROVIDED INPUT ON THE PASEO PADRE 
23:36:01 PARKWAY PROJECT.

23:36:05 SO THAT IS HAPPENING.

23:36:07 YOU KNOW, I'M SORRY THAT IT WAS LOST IN THE TRANSLATION.

23:36:12 I DON'T KNOW WHEN OR WHERE IT HAPPENED, BUT INFORMATION IS BEING GATHERED BUT 
23:36:19 I UNDERSTAND THAT COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN WANTS IT IN A MORE SPECIFIC MANNER, 
23:36:23 AND YOU KNOW, THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE CAN CERTAINLY LOOK AT AND COME BACK TO 
23:36:24 YOU ALL WITH A RECOMMENDATION.

23:36:30 >> Vice Mayor Salwan: I'M OKAY WITH --

23:36:33 >> Mayor Mei: IT SOUNDS LIKE FROM THE COUNCIL IT'S UNANIMOUS FROM WHAT I 
23:36:37 HEAR SO FAR TO SUPPORT THE REFERRAL.

23:36:39 >> Councilmember Kassan: I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE, I FEEL LIKE THERE'S A 
23:36:45 LITTLE BIT OF LACK OF CLARITY HERE BECAUSE I ASKED FOR A CERTAIN THING TO 
23:36:51 HAPPEN, AND I WAS TOLD IT COULD NOT HAPPEN AND WOULD NOT HAPPEN, BUT THEN 
23:36:56 COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN SAID, OH, WELL, ISN'T IT ALREADY  HAPPENING, AND THEN 
23:37:00 CITY MANAGER SHACKELFORD KIND OF SAID, WELL, YEAH, IT IS ALREADY HAPPENING, 
23:37:01 WE'RE GETTING INPUT.

23:37:05 SO I JUST WANT TO BE REALLY CLEAR THAT I AM ASKING FOR SOMETHING THAT I 
23:37:11 BELIEVE I WAS TOLD IS NOT CURRENTLY HAPPENING AND THAT STAFF IS NOT 
23:37:15 SUPPORTIVE OF RIGHT NOW, WHICH IS GETTING FORMAL INPUT.

23:37:20 I MEAN, THAT DID NOT HAPPEN IN THIS CASE IN PARTICULAR, YOU KNOW, AS AN 
23:37:21 EXAMPLE WITH PASEO PADRE.

23:37:27 SO I JUST WANT -- I FEEL LIKE THERE'S SOME LACK OF CLARITY GOING ON WITH THE 
23:37:32 DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT STAFF IS DOING RIGHT NOW, WHICH IS ASKING PEOPLE -- 
23:37:35 SAYING, HEY, YOU'RE WELCOME TO GIVE INPUT.

23:37:40 THAT'S VERY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT I'M ASKING FOR, WHICH IS A PROCESS THAT 
23:37:46 GETS US THE INFORMATION AS IT A COUNCIL REGARDING WHAT THE COMMISSION -- THOSE 
23:37:51 TWO COMMISSIONS FEEL ABOUT ANY MAJOR ROAD PROJECTS.

23:37:54 SO WHAT I'M ASKING FOR, MY UNDERSTANDING IS WHAT I'M ASKING FOR 
23:37:58 IS SOMETHING THAT WE WERE TOLD AT THE LAST MEETING THAT STAFF DOES NOT WANT 
23:38:01 TO DO BECAUSE THEY FEEL LIKE -- BECAUSE THE QUARTERLY MEETING WOULDN'T ALLOW 
23:38:01 FOR IT.

23:38:06 THAT'S WHAT I HEARD DIRECTOR LARSEN SAY ABOUT THAT.

23:38:10 >> City Mgr. Shackelford: YEAH, I THINK I'VE ACKNOWLEDGED THE DIFFERENCE 
23:38:13 BETWEEN WHAT YOU'RE ASKING FOR AND WHAT'S CURRENTLY HAPPENING.

23:38:20 THE INPUT IS HAPPENING, BUT IT'S NOT HAPPENING IN AS FORMAL OF A MANNER AS 
23:38:22 WHAT YOU'RE  REQUESTING, COUNCILMEMBER  KASSAN.

23:38:29 AND SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE ACKNOWLEDGING TONIGHT BY WAY OF THIS REFERRAL, 
23:38:33 YOU'RE INTERESTED IN HAVING A STRAW POLL OF THESE TWO COMMISSIONS, AND 
23:38:40 YOU'RE ALSO INTERESTED IN HAVING THE MEETING MINUTES OF THESE TWO 
23:38:47 COMMISSIONS REPORTED BACK TO COUNCIL AS PART OF STAFF RECOMMENDATIONS WHERE 
23:38:51 THERE WERE MAJOR TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS INVOLVED.

23:38:55 SO I'M CLEAR ON IT.

23:38:57 I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE ASKING FOR.

23:39:03 AND SO IT IS DIFFERENT THAN WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW, THE INPUT IS 
23:39:12 COMING BUT IN A LESS FORMAL MANNER, SO, YOU KNOW, YOUR REFERRAL IS CRYSTAL 
23:39:18 CLEAR TO ME, BUT I'M NOT THE ONE VOTING ON IT SO I'LL STOP TALKING AND DEFER 
23:39:18 TO YOU ALL.

23:39:24 >> Councilmember Kassan: OKAY.

23:39:28 I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE IT WAS CLEAR BECAUSE WITH WHAT COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN 
23:39:32 ASKED, IT SEEMED LIKE IT MIGHT NOT BE SO I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE.

23:39:36 >> Councilmember Cox: I DID WANT TO ASK FOR ONE OTHER THING JUST FOR 
23:39:36 CLARIFICATION.

23:39:41 ILL KNOW YOU HAVE SENIOR, I KNOW YOU HAVE MOBILITY.

23:39:45 I REALLY THINK TRANSPORTATION ALSO WOULD IMPACT OUR YOUTH.

23:39:49  IN THAT REGARD.

23:39:55 BECAUSE SOME OF THE STUFF WE JUST TALKED ABOUT WAS NEAR SCHOOLS, AND I 
23:40:00 THINK THAT THAT WOULD BE A BIG MISS.

23:40:05 I THINK ALSO, I GET WHAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO HAVE, WHAT YOU'RE PROPOSING, 
23:40:06 COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN.

23:40:07 I DO UNDERSTAND THAT.

23:40:09 AND I APPRECIATE THAT.

23:40:14 I JUST -- THERE'S A LITTLE PART OF ME THAT I'M A LITTLE WORRIED THAT YOU 
23:40:19 ASKED FOR THREE AS THE SLIDING SLOPE AS OUR CITY MANAGER HAS REFERRED TO.

23:40:22 IF YOU ASK FOR THREE, THE OTHER PEOPLE FEEL LEFT OUT, YOU KNOW, THE OTHER 
23:40:30 COMMISSIONS, AND IT GETS A LITTLE INTO WE'RE NOT BEING INCLUSIVE OF INVOLVING 
23:40:36 EVERYONE ON SOME OF THESE DECISIONS THAT EVEN NO MATTER HOW SMALL, SOME 
23:40:38 ARE MORE BIGGER IMPACT OF THESE DECISIONS.

23:40:39 THAT'S MY ONLY CONCERN.

23:40:49  IN THAT REGARD, IS THAT I KNOW THAT IT WAS RAISED BEFORE, SENIORS DIDN'T HAVE 
23:40:58 ANY INPUT IN THE CENTERVILLE PROJECT THAT WE HAD TALKED ABOUT A FEW WEEKS 
23:41:01 AS WELL, WHICH KIND OF TRIGGERED A LITTLE BIT OF SOME OF THIS THAT HAS 
23:41:02 COME FORWARD.

23:41:09 I JUST GET A LITTLE WORRIED WHEN WE HAVE ALL THESE WONDERFUL COMMISSIONS 
23:41:14 AND EVERYBODY IS DOING IT AS A LABOR OF LOVE, AND THERE'S GOING TO BE SOMEBODY 
23:41:20 LEFT OUT THAT WE SHOULD HAVE  ASKED AND WE DIDN'T, AND IT COULD COME BACK TO 
23:41:21 BITE US.

23:41:29 AND SO I JUST HAVE THAT LITTLE BIT OF CONCERN OF -- IF IT'S POSSIBLE, AND 
23:41:37 MAYBE I COULD GET A LITTLE CLARIFICATION THERE IN TERMS OF, YOU 
23:41:41 KNOW, IT'S ONE THING TO SEND IT OUT AND GET THE FORMAL MEETING MINUTES, BUT 
23:41:42 WHAT IF THERE'S SOME OTHER GROUPS WE LEFT OUT?

23:41:48 THAT'S THE ONLY THING I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THAT WOULDN'T DOCUMENTED.

23:41:51 >> Mayor Mei: MAY I NOTE A TIME CHECK.

23:41:52 THIS IS A TWO-STEP PROCESS.

23:41:57 SO WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR IS ARE WE MOVING THE STAFF -- THE RECOMMENDATION 
23:42:01 FOR STAFF TO COME BACK WITH THE PROPOSAL AND NOTING ALL THE 
23:42:07 COMMISSIONS ARE VERY IMPORTANT IN ADDITION TO THE -- IN PARTICULAR FOR 
23:42:12 THIS TRANSPORTATION, MOBILITY, AND THEN AS PERHAPS NEEDED DEPENDING ON THE 
23:42:16 PROJECT, WHETHER OR NOT -- I MEAN, JUST LIKE EVERY OTHER INDIVIDUAL, THE 
23:42:21 COMMISSIONS ARE ALSO INFORMED OF WHEN THESE PROJECTS ARE COMING UP.

23:42:25 WE USUALLY DO HEARINGS FOR ALL THESE MAJOR ROAD PROJECTS, WHETHER IT'S THE 
23:42:27 CENTERVILLE ONE AND OTHER ONES, THEY WERE NOTED AND ACTUALLY THE 
23:42:32 CENTERVILLE ONE HAD MULTIPLE, MULTIPLE PRESENTATIONS, BOTH AT ARTISTS WALK 
23:42:36 AND OTHER LOCATIONS, SO EVERY COMMISSION OR EVERY INDIVIDUAL, AND I 
23:42:40 HEARD THAT FROM THE COMMUNITY, IS SOMETHING AVAILABLE FOR PEOPLE TO ATTEND.

23:42:43 WE ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO ATTEND IN FRONT.

23:42:46 SO THEREFORE, DO WE HAVE ENOUGH, BECAUSE I'M JUST LOOKING AT TIME 
23:42:47 CHECK, THAT WE CAN JUST --

23:42:54 >> Councilmember Kassan: CAN I QUICKLY RESPOND TO THE QUESTION OF THE 
23:42:54 SLIPPERY SLOPE?

23:42:58 THERE WERE ONLY TWO REPRESENTATIVES, TWO PEOPLE  FROM -- TWO COMMISSIONS.

23:43:02 THERE WERE PEOPLE FROM TWO COMMISSIONS WHO EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT NOT BEING 
23:43:13 INCLUDED IN THESE KINDS OF DECISIONS, SO THOSE ARE THE TWO FOR THE REFERRAL.

23:43:18 OTHERS CAME FORWARD AND COULD HAVE SAID -- BUT THEY DIDN'T.

23:43:21 SO I THINK WE SHOULD START WITH THOSE AND IF WE WANT TO ADD MORE LATER, FINE.

23:43:27 >> City Mgr. Shackelford: SO FROM AN ADMINISTRATIVE PERSPECTIVE, IF I MAY, 
23:43:31 WE'RE GOING TO GO BACK AND DO OUR DUE DILIGENCE ON BEST PRACTICES, YOU KNOW, 
23:43:38 FROM OUR COMPARATOR  CITIES, OUR NEIGHBORING CITIES HERE IN ALAMEDA 
23:43:42 COUNTY TO MAKE SURE WE'RE DOING THE RIGHT  THING, NOT LEAVING ANYBODY OUT, 
23:43:47 AN JUST COVERING ALL OF OUR BASES, BUT DEFINITELY FOCUSING ON THE TWO 
23:43:51 COMMISSIONS THAT ARE REFERENCED IN THIS REFERRAL.

23:43:53 SO NOT TO WORRY.

23:43:58 OUR RECOMMENDATION WHEN WE COME BACK WILL BE FULL AND COMPLETE, AND 
23:43:59 CONSIDER ALL OF THE COMMISSIONS THAT WE HAVE.

23:44:01 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

23:44:07 SO WE HAVE A MOTION -- I KNOW COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN YOU WOULD LIKE TO 
23:44:09 MAKE THE MOTION  PROBABLY.

23:44:15 AND THEN I THINK WE HAVE MORE THAN ONE SECOND, UNLESS COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN 
23:44:17 AND SHAO, DO YOU HAVE SOMETHING DIFFERENT TO NOTE?

23:44:21 BECAUSE OTHERWISE, AGAIN, WE'RE RUNNING PAST 11:30 THAT I SAID.

23:44:26 >> Councilmember Shao: I'M AGAINST THIS REFERRAL BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE THEIR 
23:44:32 INPUT HAS MORE WEIGHT THAN THE RESIDENTS WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE 
23:44:33 SURVEY.

23:44:38 THE SURVEY WAS WELL DESIGNED, IT COLLECTED INFORMATION NOT ONLY YES OR 
23:44:46 NO BUT ALSO THEIR CONNECTIONS TO THE ROADWORK AND IT HAS A LOT OF VALUES IN 
23:44:48 OUR DECISION-MAKING.

23:44:55 SO THIS REFERRAL IMPLIES THAT THOSE COMMISSIONERS HAVE MORE WEIGHT IN 
23:44:57 THEIR SAYING THAN OTHER PEOPLE.

23:44:59 >> Councilmember Kassan: NO, IT DOES NOT.

23:45:00 IT DOES NOT.

23:45:01 THAT IS NOT CORRECT.

23:45:02 I'M SORRY BUT THAT'S NOT  CORRECT.

23:45:09 >> Mayor Mei: WELL, EACH COUNCILMEMBER HAS THEIR OPTION TO SUPPORT OR OPPOSE 
23:45:10 THE REFERRAL.

23:45:11 VICE MAYOR SALWAN?

23:45:14 >> Vice Mayor Salwan: I'M SORRY, I DON'T WANT TO --

23:45:16 >> Councilmember Kassan: NO STATEMENT AT ALL THAT ONE IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN 
23:45:16 THE OTHER.

23:45:19 >> Vice Mayor Salwan: I'M SORRY, EXCUSE ME, I'M SPEAKING.

23:45:23 YEAH, SO I JUST WANTED TO SAY REAL QUICKLY, WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE A SINGLE 
23:45:27 POLICY FOR A SPECIFIC ISSUE, AND I THINK WE NEED TO LOOK AT MORE BROADLY.

23:45:31 SO I THINK WE NEED TO ENGAGE ALL THE COMMISSIONS AND FOR DIFFERENT ISSUES.

23:45:34 SO FOR EXAMPLE, IF THERE'S A HEUL MAN SERVICES ISSUE, THEN WE SHOULD GET THE 
23:45:35 HUMAN RELATION COMMISSION.

23:45:37 IF THERE IS A MOBILITY ISSUE, WE GET THE MOBILITY COMMISSION.

23:45:42 BUT I THINK WE DON'T WANT TO MAKE A ONE-OFF POLICY FOR ONE SINGLE THING 
23:45:44 THAT WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS.

23:45:49 IT SHOULD BE A POLICY THAT'S BROAD AND APPLIES TO ANY ACTION THAT WE TAKE.

23:45:53 SO I THINK I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IF WE CAN BROADEN THIS AND NOT MAKE IT JUST 
23:45:58 A SINGLE, YOU KNOW, WE HAD THIS ISSUE OF PASEO PADRE AND BECAUSE OF THAT, 
23:46:02 WE'RE GOING TO REACT AND CREATE THIS, YOU KNOW, WE'RE GOING TO ASK THESE 
23:46:02 COMMISSIONS.

23:46:05 SO I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE A BROADER LOOK AT IT.

23:46:09 >> Mayor Mei: OKAY.

23:46:12 I WOULDN'T BE OPPOSED TO THAT IDEA PERSONALLY, BUT -- COUNCILMEMBER 
23:46:15 JONES, YOU HAD YOUR HAND UP.

23:46:16 >> Councilmember Jones: JUST A QUICK COMMENT.

23:46:21 AND I AGREE WITH WHAT VICE MAYOR SALWAN SAYS, BUT I THINK THAT MAYBE ADDING 
23:46:25 THE CAVEAT THAT  AS -- WHICHEVER COMMISSION IT IS THAT THEY'RE GOING TO 
23:46:26 REACH OUT TO AS DEEMED APPROPRIATE BY STAFF.

23:46:32 SO WE'RE NOT DOING, YOU KNOW -- JUST HITTING EVERYBODY AT ONCE.

23:46:35 >> Mayor Mei: WOULD THAT BE OPEN TO YOUR SUGGESTION OF THE REFERRAL, 
23:46:39 COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, THAT WE LOOK AT THIS --

23:46:42 >> Councilmember Kassan: NO, I SPECIFICALLY WANT THESE TWO 
23:46:47 COMMISSIONS TO WEIGH IN ON THESE KINDS OF DECISIONS BECAUSE LIKE I SAID, 
23:46:51 NUMBERS OF THESE COMMISSIONS EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT THEY WERE NOT CONSULTED 
23:46:55 ON THESE DECISIONS SO THAT WOULD NOT BE FRIENDLY TO MY MOTION.

23:47:02 OF COURSE IT'S ALWAYS GREAT TO ADD OTHERS, BUT THESE ARE THE TWO THAT I 
23:47:06 THINK ARE REALLY IMPORTANT TO CONSULT BECAUSE THEY -- ONE, BECAUSE THEY'RE 
23:47:09 VERY MUCH AFFECTED, AND TWO, BECAUSE THEY SPECIFICALLY EXPRESSED THE DESIRE 
23:47:11 TO HAVE MORE INCLUSION IN THESE DECISIONS.

23:47:17 AND I JUST CAN'T IMAGINE WHY WE WOULDN'T WANT THE INFORMATION OF WHAT 
23:47:18 THEIR THINKING IS ON IT.

23:47:22 IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE -- WEIGH MORE OR LESS THAN ANY OTHER INFORMATION WE 
23:47:22 GET.

23:47:25 >> Mayor Mei: WELL, WHAT I'M NOT HEARING FROM THE OTHER COUNCILMEMBERS 
23:47:27 IS THAT THEY'RE SAYING THEY DON'T WANT THAT TO HAPPEN.

23:47:33 THEY'RE JUST SAYING IF WE'RE GOING TO BE DOING THE REQUEST OF THE STUDY OR 
23:47:37 THE STAFF, THAT WE WOULD LOOK AT HOW OTHER COMMISSIONS ALSO ARE IMPACTING 
23:47:40 OTHER -- I MEAN, BECAUSE WE DIDN'T ASK THE OTHER COMMISSIONS IF THEY'D LIKE 
23:47:43 TO MAKE A VOICE OR TO INPUT ON TRANSPORTATION.

23:47:50 WHAT WE'RE ASKING IS LIKE IF ANYTHING THAT COMES UP, I  GUESS -- AND THIS IS 
23:47:53 A DISCUSSION I HAD OVER PAST YEARS WITH STAFF WHICH IS I THINK HONESTLY THAT 
23:47:57 EACH OF THE COMMISSIONS SHOULD PROBABLY HAVE AN ANNUAL MEETING WITH THE 
23:47:57 COUNCIL.

23:48:01 SO WE UNDERSTAND WHAT THEIR GOALS ARE AND WHAT OUR GOALS ARE IN TERMS OF 
23:48:04 THAT YEAR AND BE ABLE TO WORK TOGETHER ON  PROJECTS.

23:48:09 RATHER THAN EACH MEETING SEPARATELY.

23:48:13 YES, WE'D MEET SEPARATELY BUT EVEN HAVING JUST GENERAL GUIDANCE.

23:48:18 SO AS VICE MAYOR SALWAN WAS SAYING, THAT IF THERE'S A HUMAN RELATIONS 
23:48:20 RELATED TOPIC, TO MAKE SURE THAT WE INCLUDE THEM.

23:48:24 I MEAN, THIS GETS VERY --

23:48:26 >> Councilmember Kassan: THAT WOULD BE A DIFFERENT REFERRAL, RIGHT?

23:48:31 IF COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN WANTS TO MAKE A REFERRAL RELATED TO THE HUMAN 
23:48:34 RELATIONS COMMISSION, HE WOULD CERTAINLY BE FREE TO DO THAT, BUT 
23:48:36 MAYBE WE COULD JUST VOTE ON THIS ONE.

23:48:38 >> Mayor Mei: OKAY, WE'RE VOTING ON THIS ONE.

23:48:42 WE'LL GO THROUGH AND JUST MAKE YEA OR NAY ON THIS AS IT STANDS.

23:48:44 ROLL CALL, PLEASE.

23:48:47 >> Ms. Gauthier: I'M SORRY, DID WE HAVE A SECOND ON THIS?

23:48:50 THERE WAS A MOTION.

23:48:51 IS THERE A SECOND ON THIS?

23:48:56 >> Mayor Mei: I'LL MAKE A SECOND SO WE CAN JUST MAKE A VOTE.

23:48:57 >> Ms. Gauthier: OKAY.

23:49:02 >> City Mgr. Shackelford: CAN YOU REPEAT THE MOTION JUST SO THAT STAFF 
23:49:03 IS CLEAR?

23:49:06 >> Councilmember Kassan: WELL, IT IS IN -- IT'S WHAT'S IN THE MINUTES -- I 
23:49:07 MEAN IN THE AGENDA.

23:49:08 >> City Mgr. Shackelford: OKAY.

23:49:08 GOOD.

23:49:12 KOCH COX AS WRITTEN IS WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

23:49:15 >> Councilmember Kassan: YEP.

23:49:20 >> Ms. Gauthier: OKAY, WITH THE MOTION BY COUNCILMEMBER AND SECOND BY MAYOR, 
23:49:23 ROLL CALL VOTE IS COUNCILMEMBER COX, NO.

23:49:29 COUNCILMEMBER SHAO, NAY.

23:49:31 COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, YES.

23:49:42 COUNCILMEMBER JONES, UH, AYE.

23:49:44 >> Ms. Gauthier: COUNCILMEMBER KENG, AYE.

23:49:50 VICE MAYOR SALWAN, UM, I'M CONFLICTED.

23:49:55 I WOULD LIKE A BROADER ENGAGEMENT, SO I WILL VOTE NAY.

23:49:59 >> Mayor Mei: MOTION PASSES -- OH, WAIT, DID WE CALL EVERYBODY?

23:50:04 YES, SO THE MOTION PASSES WITH I THINK IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY THE THREE -- 
23:50:08 WITH FOUR AYES AND THREE NAYS.

23:50:14 NAY BEING COUNCILMEMBER SHAO, COUNCILMEMBER COX AND COUNCILMEMBER 
23:50:15 SALWAN.

23:50:19 >> Vice Mayor Salwan: AND WE'RE VOTING NAY BECAUSE WE WANT TO INCLUDE THE
