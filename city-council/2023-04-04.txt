UP ALONG THE WALL SO WE CAN BE


[Captioner] 19:16:14
MORE EFFICIENT IN TERMS OF


[Captioner] 19:16:15
SPEAKERS, THAT WOULD BE
WONDERFUL.


[Captioner] 19:16:17
WE NORMALLY DON'T ALLOW SIGNS


[Captioner] 19:16:18
BUT WE DON'T WANT TO BLOCK


[Captioner] 19:16:19
ANYONE ELSE'S VIEW BEHIND YOU,


[Captioner] 19:16:20
THAT'S WHY.


[Captioner] 19:16:21
IT'S OUT OF COURTESY FOR ALL THE


[Captioner] 19:16:22
OTHER PEOPLE.


[Captioner] 19:16:22
SO THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:16:23

[Captioner] 19:16:40
PROVIDING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO


[Captioner] 19:16:40

[Captioner] 19:16:43
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I AM


[Captioner] 19:16:45
SPEAKING, SO, YEAH, I ALSO WANT


[Captioner] 19:16:47
TO THANK THE COMMUNITY WHICH HAS


[Captioner] 19:16:48
JOINED ME.


[Captioner] 19:16:52
SO I AM TALKING ON BEHALF -- I'M


[Captioner] 19:16:55
A PRIVATE INDIVIDUAL, I'M NOT


[Captioner] 19:16:56
REPRESENTING ANY ORGANIZATION,


[Captioner] 19:16:59
BUT I AM RAISING MY VOICE


[Captioner] 19:17:03
AGAINST SB403 WHICH IS BEING


[Captioner] 19:17:05
BROUGHT SPECIFICALLY, SO I WANT


[Captioner] 19:17:07
TO RAISE HERE THAT IT'S AGAINST


[Captioner] 19:17:11
THE HINDU COMMUNITY, AND IT'S


[Captioner] 19:17:13
LIKE RECENTLY WE HAVE SEEN A LOT


[Captioner] 19:17:15
OF ATTACKS HAPPENING AGAINST THE


[Captioner] 19:17:18
HINDU COMMUNITY, AND ONE OF THE


[Captioner] 19:17:22
RECENT EVENTS WAS THE ATTACK IN


[Captioner] 19:17:24
SAN FRANCISCO, WHERE THEY'RE


[Captioner] 19:17:27
LIKE -- THIS IS ALL BASICALLY


[Captioner] 19:17:30
CONNECTED TO HINDUPHOBIA, SO I


[Captioner] 19:17:33
BASICALLY -- I'M RAISING THE


[Captioner] 19:17:35
VOICE AGAINST SB403 AND


[Captioner] 19:17:38
BASICALLY THE COUNCILMEMBERS --


[Captioner] 19:17:39
URGE THE COUNCILMEMBERS TO MAKE


[Captioner] 19:17:42
SURE THAT THIS IS NOT PASSED


[Captioner] 19:17:44
BECAUSE THE DUE DILIGENCE HAS


[Captioner] 19:17:45
NOT BEEN DONE, AND AS A


[Captioner] 19:17:50
COMMUNITY, I'M JUST -- REQUEST


[Captioner] 19:17:52
BASICALLY TO MAKE SURE THAT


[Captioner] 19:17:52
THAT'S NOT PASSED.


[Captioner] 19:17:52
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:17:53
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:17:54
JUST A POINT OF CLARIFICATION


[Captioner] 19:17:56
JUST TO LET PEOPLE KNOW, THE


[Captioner] 19:17:57
COUNCIL DOES NOT GET TO VOTE ON


[Captioner] 19:17:58
THE SENATE BILLS THEMSELVES.


[Captioner] 19:18:01
BUT WE WILL TAKE YOUR COMMENTS


[Captioner] 19:18:02
INTO CONSIDERATION SO I JUST


[Captioner] 19:18:03
WANTED TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE


[Captioner] 19:18:05
UNDERSTOOD THAT, OUR ROLE DOES


[Captioner] 19:18:06
NOT HAVE GOVERNING OVER THAT.


[Captioner] 19:18:07
NEXT SPEAKER, PLEASE.


[Captioner] 19:18:08
>> Ms. Gauthier: THE NEXT


[Captioner] 19:18:10
SPEAKER IS MINON RAWAL.


[Captioner] 19:18:12
>> HELLO.


[Captioner] 19:18:15
I'M SPEAKING HERE AS AN


[Captioner] 19:18:17
INDIVIDUAL, NOT REPRESENTING ANY
ORGANIZATION.


[Captioner] 19:18:21
THIS IS MY FIRST TIME ATTENDING


[Captioner] 19:18:23
CITY HALL, IT'S A DIFFERENT


[Captioner] 19:18:25
SETUP FOR ME SO I'M SORRY IF I'M


[Captioner] 19:18:26
COMING OUT A LITTLE NERVOUS.


[Captioner] 19:18:30
I WOULD LIKE TO JUST LOOKING


[Captioner] 19:18:31
TETRADIGS OF THIS CITY HALL


[Captioner] 19:18:33
MEETINGS, STARTING WITH THE


[Captioner] 19:18:34
PROCLAMATION, I WOULD LIKE TO


[Captioner] 19:18:35
HAVE A PROCLAMATION MYSELF, IF


[Captioner] 19:18:36
YOU WILL.


[Captioner] 19:18:42
[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]


[Captioner] 19:18:46
THE LITERAL MEANING OF WHAT I


[Captioner] 19:18:50
JUST SAID IS, MAY EVERYONE AND


[Captioner] 19:18:52
EVERYTHING BE HEALTHY, BE HAPPY,


[Captioner] 19:18:58
FREE OF ANY MISERIES OR WORRIES,


[Captioner] 19:19:01
AND MAY EVERYBODY SEE BLISSFUL
THINGS.


[Captioner] 19:19:04
AND THE REASON WHY I SAY IT IS


[Captioner] 19:19:08
THAT THIS IS INHERENT PART OF


[Captioner] 19:19:12
HOW I WAS RAISED AND MANY HINDU


[Captioner] 19:19:13
AMERICANS WHO CAME HERE WERE
RAISED.


[Captioner] 19:19:18
WE DON'T PRAY FOR -- GOOD FOR A


[Captioner] 19:19:19
PARTICULAR RELIGION, A


[Captioner] 19:19:22
PARTICULAR RACE, A PARTICULAR


[Captioner] 19:19:23
ETHNICITY, A PARTICULAR CAST.


[Captioner] 19:19:30
SO COMING ON TO THE CAST ISSUE


[Captioner] 19:19:33
HERE, I AM RAISING A FAMILY, A


[Captioner] 19:19:35
PRETTY YOUNG FAMILY WITH MY WIFE


[Captioner] 19:19:38
OF TWO KIDS, A FIFTH GRADER AND


[Captioner] 19:19:40
A FIRST GRADER IN THIS
NEIGHBORHOOD.


[Captioner] 19:19:44
AND --


[Captioner] 19:19:45
>> Mayor Mei: 30 SECONDS.


[Captioner] 19:19:46
>> OKAY, THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:19:51
SO LOOKING AT BILLS LIKE SB403,


[Captioner] 19:19:54
WE ALREADY HAVE REPORTS OF --


[Captioner] 19:19:55
MULTIPLE REPORTS OF HINDUPHOBIA


[Captioner] 19:19:57
ON THE RISE, WHERE HINDUS ARE


[Captioner] 19:19:59
BEING DISCRIMINATED AGAINST.


[Captioner] 19:20:02
BILLS LIKE SB403 WILL MAKE MY


[Captioner] 19:20:04
GENERATION AND THE GENERATION


[Captioner] 19:20:06
WHICH I'M CURRENTLY BRINGING UP


[Captioner] 19:20:10
AS HINDU AMERICANS WHO ARE


[Captioner] 19:20:11
TAKING THEIR PLEDGES EVERY DAY


[Captioner] 19:20:12
AT SCHOOL, IT WILL BECOME MORE


[Captioner] 19:20:13
AND MORE DIFFICULT.


[Captioner] 19:20:16
SO I JUST REQUEST THE CITY


[Captioner] 19:20:19
MEMBERS TO PASS A RESOLUTION


[Captioner] 19:20:19
AGAINST HINDUPHOBIA.


[Captioner] 19:20:25
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:20:29
[SPEAKERS CALLED]


[Captioner] 19:20:30
>> HI.


[Captioner] 19:20:31
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:20:36
MY NAME IS SHRI KRISHNA.


[Captioner] 19:20:39
I WANT TO INTRODUCE MYSELF AS A


[Captioner] 19:20:40
MEMBER OF THE HINDU COMMUNITY,


[Captioner] 19:20:40
PRACTICING HINDU.


[Captioner] 19:20:42
I'M A FATHER OF TWO YOUNG


[Captioner] 19:20:42
GIRLS.


[Captioner] 19:20:45
AND I'M HERE TO EXPRESS MY


[Captioner] 19:20:46
DEEPEST CONCERNS ABOUT THE BILL


[Captioner] 19:20:51
THAT IS BEING INTRODUCED IN THE


[Captioner] 19:20:54
SENATE, IN THE STATE OF


[Captioner] 19:20:54
CALIFORNIA.


[Captioner] 19:20:57
SO MY BIGGEST CONCERN IS WHILE


[Captioner] 19:20:58
RAISING MY KIDS, THERE IS


[Captioner] 19:21:00
ALREADY SO MUCH STEREOTYPES


[Captioner] 19:21:02
ASSOCIATED WITH HINDUISM.


[Captioner] 19:21:04
AND THE FIRST STEREOTYPE THAT


[Captioner] 19:21:06
COMES TO ANYONE'S MIND WHEN THEY


[Captioner] 19:21:07
HEAR ABOUT HINDUISM IS CAST.


[Captioner] 19:21:14
AND THERE IS -- THIS BILL LIKE


[Captioner] 19:21:15
THIS 403 IS PROBABLY FOR THE


[Captioner] 19:21:17
FIRST TIME IT IS INTRODUCING


[Captioner] 19:21:19
CAST AS A PROTECTED CATEGORY,


[Captioner] 19:21:21
WHICH WILL IDENTIFY AND WHICH


[Captioner] 19:21:24
WILL POTENTIALLY PROFILE THE


[Captioner] 19:21:26
MICROMINORITY COMMUNITY WHICH IS


[Captioner] 19:21:27
HINDU COMMUNITY.


[Captioner] 19:21:29
THE OTHER PROTECTIVE CATEGORIES


[Captioner] 19:21:31
WHICH ARE VERY GENERIC IN NATURE


[Captioner] 19:21:33
IN MY OPINION ALREADY SHOULD


[Captioner] 19:21:36
ADDRESS AND SHOULD BE ABLE TO


[Captioner] 19:21:38
PROVIDE JUSTICE TO THOSE WHO ARE


[Captioner] 19:21:38
DISCRIMINATED BASED ON CAST.


[Captioner] 19:21:43
SO THERE IS NO NEED TO BRING IN


[Captioner] 19:21:45
THIS PROTECTED CATEGORY, NEW


[Captioner] 19:21:46
PROTECTED CATEGORY WHICH IS


[Captioner] 19:21:48
GOING TO PROFILE AND MONITOR


[Captioner] 19:21:50
HINDU COMMUNITY, AND IT IS GOING


[Captioner] 19:21:52
TO FURTHER PERPETUATE THE


[Captioner] 19:21:53
STEREOTYPES THAT OUR COMMUNITY


[Captioner] 19:21:54
IS ALREADY FACING, AND AS YOU


[Captioner] 19:21:57
HEARD FROM OTHER MEMBERS, THERE


[Captioner] 19:21:59
IS A SYSTEMIC RISE IN THE


[Captioner] 19:22:01
ATTACKS ON THE HINDU COMMUNITY.


[Captioner] 19:22:03
AND THIS IS GOING TO FURTHER


[Captioner] 19:22:04
FUEL THOSE ATTACKS.


[Captioner] 19:22:06
PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO ATTACK
IT.


[Captioner] 19:22:09
AND ALSO I WANT TO BRING YOUR


[Captioner] 19:22:11
ATTENTION TO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE


[Captioner] 19:22:11
BEHIND THIS BILL.


[Captioner] 19:22:13
THERE IS THIS ORGANIZATION


[Captioner] 19:22:14
CALLED EQUALITY LAB, WHICH


[Captioner] 19:22:19
CLAIMS TO HAVE DONE A SURVEY BUT


[Captioner] 19:22:20
THAT SURVEY HAS BEEN DEBUNKED


[Captioner] 19:22:22
AND MORE IMPORTANTLY, THAT


[Captioner] 19:22:23
ORGANIZATION, THE FOUNDERS OF


[Captioner] 19:22:25
THAT ORGANIZATION, THEY HAVE


[Captioner] 19:22:28
OPENLY, THEY HAVE VERY OPENLY


[Captioner] 19:22:29
PLACED THEIR POSITION IN THE


[Captioner] 19:22:32
PUBLIC DOMAIN THAT DESTROYING


[Captioner] 19:22:33
HINDUISM IS THEIR MAIN MOTIVE.


[Captioner] 19:22:35
THERE IS SO MUCH EVIDENCE TO


[Captioner] 19:22:38
PROVE THAT, AND WE CANNOT TRUST


[Captioner] 19:22:39
THE DATA THAT WAS PRODUCED BY


[Captioner] 19:22:39
THIS ORGANIZATION.


[Captioner] 19:22:41
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU, SIR.


[Captioner] 19:22:45
>> Ms. Gauthier: NEXT SPEAKER


[Captioner] 19:22:48
IS SYSHA DESAI.


[Captioner] 19:22:49
>> HI.


[Captioner] 19:22:51
THANK YOU, MAYOR MEI AND THE


[Captioner] 19:22:53
CITY COUNCIL FOR ALLOWING ME TO
SPEAK.


[Captioner] 19:22:55
SO I WANT TO ECHO WHAT SOME OF


[Captioner] 19:22:56
THE MEMBERS HAVE SAID HERE.


[Captioner] 19:23:01
THERE IS A SYSTEMIC RACISM BY


[Captioner] 19:23:06
INTRODUCING THIS SB403 BILL


[Captioner] 19:23:06
AGAINST ASIANS.


[Captioner] 19:23:10
IT IS PROFILING ASIANS, AND


[Captioner] 19:23:13
DIVIDING ASIANS COMMUNITY, ASIAN
COMMUNITY.


[Captioner] 19:23:16
SO I WANT TO STRONGLY SEE IF YOU


[Captioner] 19:23:18
CAN TAKE OUR VOICE FURTHER.


[Captioner] 19:23:22
I KNOW THIS IS NOT -- THIS IS A


[Captioner] 19:23:23
STATE BILL AND CITY COUNCIL


[Captioner] 19:23:24
DOESN'T GET TO VOTE ON IT.


[Captioner] 19:23:28
BUT I THINK WHAT WE WANT TO HAVE


[Captioner] 19:23:31
THE CITY HELP WITH IS TO TAKE


[Captioner] 19:23:34
THE VOICE OF THE ASIAN COMMUNITY


[Captioner] 19:23:36
HERE TO NOT PASS SUCH KIND OF


[Captioner] 19:23:39
RACIST AND SYSTEMIC RACIST BILLS


[Captioner] 19:23:41
AND LAWS WHICH TARGET ASIANS.


[Captioner] 19:23:43
AS SUCH, THERE HAS BEEN


[Captioner] 19:23:45
INCREASING ASIAN HATE, AND THIS


[Captioner] 19:23:49
WILL CREATE MORE OF THOSE ASIAN


[Captioner] 19:23:53
HATE, AND IT'S UNAMERICAN, IT'S


[Captioner] 19:23:55
UNCONSTITUTIONAL, ILLEGAL TO


[Captioner] 19:23:59
HAVE CATEGORIES TARGETED TO JUST


[Captioner] 19:24:00
SPECIFIC COMMUNITIES.


[Captioner] 19:24:04
AND I REALLY WANT THE HELP OF


[Captioner] 19:24:07
THIS ESTEEMED PANEL TO MAKE OUR


[Captioner] 19:24:07
VOICE HEARD.


[Captioner] 19:24:10
MAYBE AT FREMONT LEVEL AS WELL,


[Captioner] 19:24:12
THERE ARE A LOT OF INDIAN


[Captioner] 19:24:13
AMERICANS, ASIAN AMERICANS AND


[Captioner] 19:24:16
 HINDUS, AND IF YOU COULD


[Captioner] 19:24:21
PASS SOME RESOLUTION ARGUING FOR


[Captioner] 19:24:25
OR SAYING YOU OPPOSE HINDU HATE,


[Captioner] 19:24:27
YOU OPPOSE HINDUPHOBIA AND ALSO


[Captioner] 19:24:29
HELP US TAKE THIS VOICE FORWARD,


[Captioner] 19:24:29
WE WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE IT.


[Captioner] 19:24:30
THANK YOU SO MUCH.


[Captioner] 19:24:32
>> Ms. Gauthier: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:24:36
THE NEXT SPEAKER IS ARUN NAMANI


[Captioner] 19:24:39
FOLLOWED BY SRIDHAR.


[Captioner] 19:24:41
>> I'M TALKING ON BEHALF OF ALL


[Captioner] 19:24:43
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE STANDING, SO


[Captioner] 19:24:44
LIKE THE MAYOR SAID, I WANTED TO


[Captioner] 19:24:49
TAKE THE TIME TO TALK ON BEHALF


[Captioner] 19:24:49
OF THEM.


[Captioner] 19:24:54
WE, THE SOUTH ASIAN HINDUS, ARE


[Captioner] 19:24:56
BEING TARGETED IN FREMONT.


[Captioner] 19:25:00
MANY OF US HAVE EXPERIENCED HATE
CRIMES.


[Captioner] 19:25:04
EVERYONE KNOWS ABOUT THE


[Captioner] 19:25:04
CHRISTIAN INCIDENT.


[Captioner] 19:25:06
OUR STATE SENATOR IS INTRODUCING


[Captioner] 19:25:08
A BILL WHICH IS GOING TO


[Captioner] 19:25:10
RACIALLY PROFILE AND


[Captioner] 19:25:12
DISCRIMINATE AND FURTHER


[Captioner] 19:25:14
INCREASE ASIAN AND HINDU HATE.


[Captioner] 19:25:19
I REITERATE, IT WILL INCREASE


[Captioner] 19:25:20
ASIAN AND HINDU HATE.


[Captioner] 19:25:26
SO THIS BILL, THIS BILL MIGHT


[Captioner] 19:25:32
LOOK AS A PROGRESSIVE BILL ON


[Captioner] 19:25:33
THE OUTSIDE, BUT IT IS NOT.


[Captioner] 19:25:36
IF ANYONE HAS ANY QUESTIONS,


[Captioner] 19:25:38
PLEASE FEEL FREE, WE WILL SET UP


[Captioner] 19:25:42
A MEETING TO EXPLAIN WHY IT IS


[Captioner] 19:25:45
SO, AND HOW IT IS GOING TO


[Captioner] 19:25:46
DISCRIMINATE AND RACIALLY


[Captioner] 19:25:46
PROFILE US.


[Captioner] 19:25:51
MY CHILDREN WILL BE PROFILED,


[Captioner] 19:25:52
VILIFIED, AND HARASSED DUE TO


[Captioner] 19:25:55
THE ACTIONS OF A SENATOR WHO HAS


[Captioner] 19:25:56
AN OFFICE IN FREMONT AND IS


[Captioner] 19:25:57
SUPPOSED TO REPRESENT US.


[Captioner] 19:26:02
WE REQUEST YOU ALL TO MAKE OUR


[Captioner] 19:26:04
COMMUNITY SAFE, FEEL SAFE, AND


[Captioner] 19:26:05
PLEASE PASS A RESOLUTION AGAINST


[Captioner] 19:26:08
HINDU PHOBIA AND HINDU HATE.


[Captioner] 19:26:08
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:26:17
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:26:23
THAT'S VERY HELPFUL.


[Captioner] 19:26:26
>> THE NEXT SPEAKER, SRIDHAR.


[Captioner] 19:26:26
>> THAT'S ME.


[Captioner] 19:26:27
THANK YOU FOR THE TIME.


[Captioner] 19:26:29
I'M HERE TO ASK YOU ABOUT TWO


[Captioner] 19:26:31
THINGS, TO PASS A RESOLUTION


[Captioner] 19:26:32
THAT INCLUDES TWO THINGS.


[Captioner] 19:26:35
MY COMMUNITY MEMBERS HERE


[Captioner] 19:26:37
TALKING ABOUT THE HINDUPHOBIA,


[Captioner] 19:26:39
AND I AM A FIRST TIME


[Captioner] 19:26:40
EXPERIENCED PERSON OF THAT ONE.


[Captioner] 19:26:42
I HAD TO EXPERIENCE THAT ONE


[Captioner] 19:26:45
WHILE JUST GOING FOR PARKING IN


[Captioner] 19:26:46
THE STANFORD PARKING LOT AND


[Captioner] 19:26:47
GOING UP THE MISSION PEAK.


[Captioner] 19:26:51
AND I WAS CALLED OUT BECAUSE YOU


[Captioner] 19:26:52
HINDUS, YOU GO BACK HOME, WHAT


[Captioner] 19:26:56
ARE YOU DOING HERE, YOU'RE NOT


[Captioner] 19:26:57
AMERICAN, YOU'RE AN INDIAN, GO


[Captioner] 19:26:57
BACK TO INDIA.


[Captioner] 19:27:01
SO THAT WAS PLAYED OUT ON ME, MY


[Captioner] 19:27:03
WIFE, AND MY YOUNG SON, WHO WAS


[Captioner] 19:27:05
WITH US, ON GOING ON A HIKE.


[Captioner] 19:27:06
AND THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE.


[Captioner] 19:27:11
SO I'M ASKING YOU GUYS TO PASS A


[Captioner] 19:27:11
RESOLUTION THAT IS GOING TO MAKE


[Captioner] 19:27:15
SURE THAT HINDUPHOBIA IS NOT


[Captioner] 19:27:16
PROPAGATED, IS NOT PLAYED OUT IN


[Captioner] 19:27:18
OUR COMMUNITY, IN THE CITY OF
FREMONT HERE.


[Captioner] 19:27:21
THE SECOND PART, EVERYBODY IS


[Captioner] 19:27:23
TALKING ABOUT THE SB403 AND THE


[Captioner] 19:27:26
CAST, AND IF WE ALLOW THAT TO


[Captioner] 19:27:28
COME IN AND PLAY OUT AT THE


[Captioner] 19:27:30
STATE LEVEL AND IF THE FREMONT


[Captioner] 19:27:32
CITY DOES NOT DO SOMETHING ABOUT


[Captioner] 19:27:34
THAT ONE, SO THAT IS GOING TO


[Captioner] 19:27:35
CAUSE A LOT OF PROBLEM ALONG


[Captioner] 19:27:37
WITH THE HINDUPHOBIA THAT WE ARE


[Captioner] 19:27:38
TALKING ABOUT, IT'S ALSO GOING


[Captioner] 19:27:40
TO DIVIDE THE COMMUNITY ON THE


[Captioner] 19:27:42
CAST, AND RIGHT NOW, IF NONE OF


[Captioner] 19:27:44
OUR KIDS HAVE EVEN ANY


[Captioner] 19:27:47
CONSCIOUSNESS ABOUT CAST AS AN


[Captioner] 19:27:48
ITEM, THEY DON'T TALK ABOUT IT,


[Captioner] 19:27:49
THEY DON'T KNOW ABOUT IT, THEY


[Captioner] 19:27:50
DON'T DISCUSS IT.


[Captioner] 19:27:55
NOW WE ARE GOING TO SEED THAT


[Captioner] 19:27:56
INTO THEIR MIND TO START


[Captioner] 19:27:57
THINKING ABOUT THAT.


[Captioner] 19:28:00
SO I ASK YOU GUYS TO PASS A


[Captioner] 19:28:02
RESOLUTION THAT IS OPPOSING THE


[Captioner] 19:28:03
HINDUPHOBIA AND ANY LAW THAT IS


[Captioner] 19:28:05
COMING INTO THE STATE THAT IS


[Captioner] 19:28:08
GOING TO MAKE THE CAST AS ONE OF


[Captioner] 19:28:08
THE DISCRIMINATORY ITEMS.


[Captioner] 19:28:09
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:28:11
>> Ms. Gauthier: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:28:13
THE NEXT SPEAKER IS SAI, FOLLOW

[Captioner] 19:28:22
>> RESPECTED MAYOR AND CITY


[Captioner] 19:28:22
COUNCIL, I'M BACK.


[Captioner] 19:28:25
I WAS HERE ABOUT TWO WEEK AGO, I


[Captioner] 19:28:27
WAS HOPING THAT WHEN WE MEET THE


[Captioner] 19:28:29
NEXT TIME AROUND, WE MIGHT HAVE


[Captioner] 19:28:30
BETTER TIDINGS BUT


[Captioner] 19:28:32
UNFORTUNATELY, YOU KNOW, WE'VE


[Captioner] 19:28:33
SEEN OVER THE LAST TWO WEEKS


[Captioner] 19:28:35
THAT AN ENTIRE COMMUNITY OF


[Captioner] 19:28:36
AMERICANS AND RESIDENTS IN THIS


[Captioner] 19:28:38
COUNTRY CONTINUES TO BE


[Captioner] 19:28:40
VILIFIED, STEREOTYPED, PROFILED


[Captioner] 19:28:42
AND HELD TO BE PRESUMPTIVELY


[Captioner] 19:28:44
GUILTY, SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY


[Captioner] 19:28:46
DECIDED TO PRACTICE A CERTAIN


[Captioner] 19:28:49
FAITH OR ARE ASSUMED TO BE
PARTICIPATING IN A CERTAIN
FAITH.


[Captioner] 19:28:52
MAYOR MEI, YOU KNOW, 15,986, YOU


[Captioner] 19:28:54
KNOW WHAT THAT NUMBER IS?


[Captioner] 19:28:57
15,986 IS UNFORTUNATELY THE


[Captioner] 19:28:59
NUMBER OF VOTES THAT CAME


[Captioner] 19:29:01
BETWEEN, YOU KNOW, HAVING A


[Captioner] 19:29:02
TRULY REPRESENTATIVE STATE


[Captioner] 19:29:06
SENATOR FOR DISTRICT 10, AND WHO


[Captioner] 19:29:10
WE NOW HAVE IN OFFICE, WHO IT'S


[Captioner] 19:29:12
KIND OF IRONIC IN THE DAY AND


[Captioner] 19:29:13
AGE WE HAVE A FAIR HOUSING


[Captioner] 19:29:15
PROCLAMATION FOR EQUITY AND


[Captioner] 19:29:16
EQUALITY FOR ALL, YOU HAVE A


[Captioner] 19:29:18
STATE SENATOR WHO'S SPONSORING A


[Captioner] 19:29:22
BILL THAT CODE GUYS
SEGREGATION.


[Captioner] 19:29:26
THE CODIFICATION INTO OUR STATE


[Captioner] 19:29:28
LAW IS, A, A VIOLATION OF THE


[Captioner] 19:29:30
COBS TEUTION, B, A VIOLATION OF


[Captioner] 19:29:31
OUR CIVIL RIGHTS AND C, MOST


[Captioner] 19:29:34
IMPORTANTLY, A VIOLATION OF THE


[Captioner] 19:29:35
MORAL COMPASS THAT I HOPE WE AS


[Captioner] 19:29:36
AMERICANS SHARE.


[Captioner] 19:29:37
WHEN I LOOK AT THE CITY COUNCIL,


[Captioner] 19:29:38
I SEE DIVERSITY IN ACTION.


[Captioner] 19:29:40
I SEE DIVERSITY IN ACTION.


[Captioner] 19:29:42
AND IT IS SHAMEFUL THAT TODAY IN


[Captioner] 19:29:44
THE 21ST CENTURY, WE'RE SITTING


[Captioner] 19:29:47
HERE PLEADING THAT THE STATE NOT


[Captioner] 19:29:49
INTERFERE IN DESTROYING THAT


[Captioner] 19:29:51
DIVERSITY, SIMPLY BY USING A


[Captioner] 19:29:52
CAPRICIOUS, ARBITRARY AND


[Captioner] 19:29:56
IRRATIONAL FRAMEWORK IMPORTED


[Captioner] 19:29:57
AND -- ENFORCED ON OUR
CHILDREN.


[Captioner] 19:29:59
I RESPECTFULLY ASK THAT THE CITY


[Captioner] 19:30:01
CONSIDER PASSING A PROCLAMATION,


[Captioner] 19:30:03
GIVEN THAT THE STATE SENATOR HAS


[Captioner] 19:30:04
HER OFFICE HERE, THAT THE CITY


[Captioner] 19:30:06
CONSIDER A PROCLAMATION AGAINST


[Captioner] 19:30:08
HINDU HATE, AND AGAINST HATE OF


[Captioner] 19:30:10
ALL KINDS, BECAUSE WE ARE THE


[Captioner] 19:30:12
HAPPIEST CITY IN THE COUNTRY.


[Captioner] 19:30:13
LET US CONTINUE TO REMAIN THAT
WAY.


[Captioner] 19:30:16
GOD BLESS US, AND GOD BLESS THE


[Captioner] 19:30:17
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.


[Captioner] 19:30:17
THANK YOU.

THE NEXT SPEAKER, KRISHNA
KUMAR.


[Captioner] 19:30:25
FOLLOWED BY PADMA.


[Captioner] 19:30:28
>> GOOD EVENING.


[Captioner] 19:30:33
TODAY I WANT TO TALK ABOUT SB403


[Captioner] 19:30:40
EXPRESSING MY ANGUISH AT A


[Captioner] 19:30:43
STATE SENATOR INTRODUCING SUCH A


[Captioner] 19:30:44
DISCRIMINATORY BILL ALONG WITH


[Captioner] 19:30:46
THE HINDUPHOBIA THAT WE'RE


[Captioner] 19:30:46
ALREADY FACING.


[Captioner] 19:30:55
BUT, THE CLOSER POINT HERE IS


[Captioner] 19:30:56
THAT CAST IS NOT EVEN A WORD IN


[Captioner] 19:30:58
ANY OF THE INDIAN LANGUAGES, IT


[Captioner] 19:31:00
IS NOT IN THE INDIAN KNOWLEDGE


[Captioner] 19:31:01
SYSTEMS AT ALL.


[Captioner] 19:31:05
IT'S AN IMPOSED WORD FROM


[Captioner] 19:31:08
OUTSIDE, TRYING TO EXPLAIN WHAT


[Captioner] 19:31:09
THE TWO TERMS IN THE INDIAN


[Captioner] 19:31:11
KNOWLEDGE SYSTEMS ARE.


[Captioner] 19:31:20
SUCH A MISUNDERSTANDING IMPOSED


[Captioner] 19:31:22
ON US BY COLONIAL RULERS IS NOT


[Captioner] 19:31:29
TO BE CODIFIED INTO A LAW BY THE


[Captioner] 19:31:31
STATE SENATOR WHO IS UNWITTINGLY


[Captioner] 19:31:32
OR WITTINGLY MAKING THE EFFORT.


[Captioner] 19:31:38
I WOULD REQUEST THE ENTIRE


[Captioner] 19:31:39
COMMUNITY AS WELL AS THE


[Captioner] 19:31:41
COUNCILMEMBERS TO RAISE THEIR


[Captioner] 19:31:45
VOICE AGAINST SUCH PRACTICE AND


[Captioner] 19:31:47
EXPLAIN TO THEM WHAT THIS CAST


[Captioner] 19:31:47
IS ABOUT.


[Captioner] 19:31:51
I'M STANDING BY TO BE ABLE TO


[Captioner] 19:31:53
OFFER A CLEAN AND DETAILED


[Captioner] 19:31:55
EXPLANATION IF NECESSARY, BUT I


[Captioner] 19:31:57
WANT TO REGISTER MY PROTEST


[Captioner] 19:31:59
AGAINST THIS PRACTICE.


[Captioner] 19:32:00
AGAINST THIS BILL IN THE FIRST
PLACE.


[Captioner] 19:32:02
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR
TIME.


[Captioner] 19:32:06
>> Ms. Gauthier: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:32:14
PAD MA FOLLOWED BY RAKESH SINGH.


[Captioner] 19:32:16
>> GOOD EVENING.


[Captioner] 19:32:19
A BETWEEN FIVE-YEAR RESIDENT OF


[Captioner] 19:32:20
FREMONT I'M ONE OF 250 PEOPLE


[Captioner] 19:32:23
WHO MET TODAY FOR A SILENT AND


[Captioner] 19:32:28
PEACEFUL PROTEST OUTSIDE SENATOR


[Captioner] 19:32:29
WAHAB'S OFFICE AGAINST SB403.


[Captioner] 19:32:31
I WENT TO HER OFFICE ALONG WITH


[Captioner] 19:32:33
A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE TO HAND HER
A PETITION.


[Captioner] 19:32:38
HER STAFF WERE STANDING OUTSIDE


[Captioner] 19:32:40
HER OFFICE AND LIED TO ME, TO MY


[Captioner] 19:32:42
FACE, THAT THEY DON'T WORK FOR


[Captioner] 19:32:45
HER, AND CLAIMED THAT HER OFFICE


[Captioner] 19:32:47
IS CLOSED AND DID NOT ACCEPT OUR
PETITION.


[Captioner] 19:32:49
HOWEVER, THE SENATOR DOESN'T


[Captioner] 19:32:52
HAVE ANY PROBLEM ASSOCIATING


[Captioner] 19:32:53
WITH A SECRETIVE GROUP CALLED


[Captioner] 19:32:55
EQUITY LABS WHICH IS KNOWN TO


[Captioner] 19:32:57
HAVE HATRED FOR HINDUS AND A


[Captioner] 19:32:59
DESIRE TO DESTROY THE OLDEST


[Captioner] 19:33:00
RELIGION IN THE WORLD,
HINDUISM.


[Captioner] 19:33:04
WE AS A COMMUNITY LIVE


[Captioner] 19:33:06
PEACEFULLY AND IN HARMONY WITH


[Captioner] 19:33:06
EVERYBODY AROUND US.


[Captioner] 19:33:09
THIS BILL HAS ONLY ONE


[Captioner] 19:33:10
INTENTION, TO DIVIDE US.


[Captioner] 19:33:13
AND AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THAT, IT


[Captioner] 19:33:15
WILL CREATE HINDU HATE, AND THIS


[Captioner] 19:33:17
WILL INCREASE AND CAUSE HARM AND


[Captioner] 19:33:20
CAUSE ATTACKS SUCH AS THE ATTACK


[Captioner] 19:33:22
ON A HINDU IN A TACO BELL IN OUR


[Captioner] 19:33:22
OWN CITY OF FREMONT.


[Captioner] 19:33:26
I'M A MOTHER OF TWO CHILDREN,


[Captioner] 19:33:29
AND MY CHILDREN SHOULD NOT BE


[Captioner] 19:33:31
DISCRIMINATED AGAINST OR HURT ON


[Captioner] 19:33:32
ACCOUNT OF RELIGIOUS PROFILING


[Captioner] 19:33:33
OR HINDU HATE.


[Captioner] 19:33:36
I REQUEST THE CITY OF FREMONT AS


[Captioner] 19:33:38
REPRESENTED BY THE CITY COUNCIL


[Captioner] 19:33:41
TO CONVEY THIS TO OUR STATE


[Captioner] 19:33:43
LEADERS, AS WELL AS PASS A


[Captioner] 19:33:46
RESOLUTION AGAINST HINDU HATE


[Captioner] 19:33:48
AND STAND WITH OUR PEACEFUL
COMMUNITY.


[Captioner] 19:33:49
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR

RAKESH SINGH FOLLOWED BY KAWAL
SINGH.


[Captioner] 19:33:57
>> HI.


[Captioner] 19:33:59
MY NAME IS RAKESH SINGH.


[Captioner] 19:34:00
GOOD EVENING, EVERYBODY.


[Captioner] 19:34:07
I'M HERE TO TALK A BIT ABOUT --


[Captioner] 19:34:09
AGAINST WHAT IS BEING PROPOSED


[Captioner] 19:34:13
BY THE SENATOR, AND IN MY


[Captioner] 19:34:15
OPINION, IT DOESN'T BELONG TO
U.S.


[Captioner] 19:34:18
THAT CASTE SYSTEM, IT'S A


[Captioner] 19:34:23
NON-ISSUE FOR U.S., AND OF A


[Captioner] 19:34:25
NON-ISSUE, SOME FOLKS ARE TRYING


[Captioner] 19:34:27
TO CREATE AN ISSUE OUT OF IT.


[Captioner] 19:34:30
AS A COUNTRY, WITH A DIFFERENT


[Captioner] 19:34:31
PRINCIPLE WHICH IS VERY, VERY


[Captioner] 19:34:33
PROGRESSIVE, FORWARD LOOKING,


[Captioner] 19:34:34
AND INCLUSIVE, RIGHT?


[Captioner] 19:34:40
AND THE MOTTO OF THE COUNTRY.


[Captioner] 19:34:43
THEN WHAT'S THE POINT OF


[Captioner] 19:34:44
HAVING -- THEY'RE CALLING IT --


[Captioner] 19:34:47
IT'S A NON-DISCRIMINATORY BILL,


[Captioner] 19:34:49
BUT IT IS IN REALITY A


[Captioner] 19:34:49
DISCRIMINATORY BILL.


[Captioner] 19:34:52
IT IS GOING TO CREATE


[Captioner] 19:34:53
DISCRIMINATION.


[Captioner] 19:34:58
ANOTHER THING IS THAT AS FAR AS


[Captioner] 19:34:59
I UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S


[Captioner] 19:35:01
IMPOSSIBLE TO IMPLEMENT THIS


[Captioner] 19:35:04
BECAUSE FROM THE LAWS, I DON'T


[Captioner] 19:35:08
THINK ANYBODY, ANY FORM, SCHOOL,


[Captioner] 19:35:09
COLLEGE, ANY JOB, ANYBODY IS


[Captioner] 19:35:11
GOING TO ASK ABOUT WHAT IS YOUR
CASTE.


[Captioner] 19:35:12
IT'S NOT IMPLEMENTABLE.


[Captioner] 19:35:17
SO SINCE THE SENATOR IS FROM OUR


[Captioner] 19:35:19
CITY, AND SHE IS PROPOSING THIS,


[Captioner] 19:35:22
I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR THE


[Captioner] 19:35:24
COUNCILMEMBERS, THE MAYOR, AND


[Captioner] 19:35:26
EVERYBODY, TO VOTE AGAINST THIS


[Captioner] 19:35:29
IF IT'S POSSIBLE, AT LEAST RAISE


[Captioner] 19:35:29
THE VOICES.


[Captioner] 19:35:30
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.


[Captioner] 19:35:31
>> Ms. Gauthier: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:35:38
KAWAL SINGH FOLLOWED BY
SHRIKAR.


[Captioner] 19:35:41
>> COUNCILMEMBERS, MAYOR AND THE
STAFF.


[Captioner] 19:35:42
GOOD EVENING, EVERYBODY.


[Captioner] 19:35:44
AND THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME THE


[Captioner] 19:35:44
CHANCE TO SPEAK.


[Captioner] 19:35:51
THERE IS NO ROOM FOR


[Captioner] 19:35:52
DISCRIMINATION BASED ON THE
CASTE.


[Captioner] 19:35:54
FEW SPEAKERS SPEAK THAT, YEAH,


[Captioner] 19:35:55
THERE IS NO CASTEISM.


[Captioner] 19:35:56
THERE IS A CASTEISM.


[Captioner] 19:35:59
THERE IS A CASTEISM EXISTING IN


[Captioner] 19:36:00
THIS COUNTRY.


[Captioner] 19:36:01
BY THE OTHER PEOPLE.


[Captioner] 19:36:09
WE ARE IN SUPPORT OF SB403 AND


[Captioner] 19:36:10
WE HAVE REPRESENTING ALL OVER


[Captioner] 19:36:13
THE COUNTRY, THIS BILL ALREADY


[Captioner] 19:36:17
BEEN PASSED IN -- AND IT'S


[Captioner] 19:36:19
ONGOING, MY DAUGHTERS, MY OTHER


[Captioner] 19:36:21
SON, THEY ARE ALSO INVOLVED,


[Captioner] 19:36:22
THEY HAVE BEEN DISCRIMINATED.


[Captioner] 19:36:25
I'M NOT SAYING IT'S HINDUS, I'M


[Captioner] 19:36:26
NOT SAYING IT'S SIKH.


[Captioner] 19:36:29
WE ARE BASED ON OUR -- OF


[Captioner] 19:36:31
THAT -- BASED ON THE CASTE,


[Captioner] 19:36:33
THERE SHOULD BE NO ROOM FOR
DISCRIMINATION.


[Captioner] 19:36:36
I'M NOT AGAINST ANY OTHER


[Captioner] 19:36:36
RELIGION OTHER THING.


[Captioner] 19:36:38
WE HAVE LIKE A THOUSAND FAMILIES
HERE.


[Captioner] 19:36:42
SO PLEASE CONSIDER THIS, DO NOT


[Captioner] 19:36:45
PLEASE MAKE -- LISTEN CAREFULLY


[Captioner] 19:36:47
TO THESE THINGS, WHAT THEY'RE


[Captioner] 19:36:48
SAYING, WHAT -- ACTUALLY WHAT IS


[Captioner] 19:36:49
THE BACKBONE BEHIND IT?


[Captioner] 19:36:50
WHY THIS IS HAPPENING.


[Captioner] 19:36:53
ALL OVER.


[Captioner] 19:36:55
I HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE OVER


[Captioner] 19:36:56
HERE, I CAN BRING A THOUSAND


[Captioner] 19:36:57
PEOPLE OVER HERE.


[Captioner] 19:36:57
THAT'S NOT THE SOLUTION.


[Captioner] 19:36:59
THE SOLUTION IS WHAT IS THE


[Captioner] 19:37:01
REALITY IN IT, WHICH IS --


[Captioner] 19:37:06
NOBODY WANTS TO DISCLOSE -- SO


[Captioner] 19:37:07
PLEASE, COUNCILMEMBERS, MAYORS,


[Captioner] 19:37:12
I REQUEST YOU HUMBLY, SB403 IS A


[Captioner] 19:37:14
VALID SB, WE ARE -- I'M 100%

[Captioner] 19:37:28

[Captioner] 19:37:28
>>


[Captioner] 19:37:31
>> HELLO, EVERYONE.


[Captioner] 19:37:33
I AM A SOPHOMORE IN COLLEGE.


[Captioner] 19:37:36
I WAS BROUGHT HERE TODAY BY MY


[Captioner] 19:37:38
MOM AND SOME OF MY PERSONAL


[Captioner] 19:37:39
INTEREST IN THIS MATTER.


[Captioner] 19:37:45
REGARDING THE BILL OR SORRY THE


[Captioner] 19:37:46
PROPOSITION SB403.


[Captioner] 19:37:50
I HEARD ABOUT THE GROWING


[Captioner] 19:37:52
CONCERN REGARDING THE HINDU


[Captioner] 19:37:53
CASTE SYSTEM IN THE UNITED


[Captioner] 19:37:55
STATES AND I WAS SHOCKED TO SEE


[Captioner] 19:37:57
IT AS I MYSELF DON'T KNOW OR


[Captioner] 19:37:58
EXPERIENCE IT IN THE U.S.


[Captioner] 19:38:03
HINDUS ARE BEING TARGETED BY


[Captioner] 19:38:07
OTHER HINDUS FOR BEING A HIGHER


[Captioner] 19:38:11
CASTE OR BY THE SO-CALLED LOWER


[Captioner] 19:38:13
CASTE STATING THAT WE GET MORE


[Captioner] 19:38:15
JOBS AND WE HAVE A BETTER


[Captioner] 19:38:16
POSITION IN SOCIETY THAN THEM.


[Captioner] 19:38:19
GROWING UP, MY PARENTS NEVER


[Captioner] 19:38:24
TALKED TO ME ABOUT HOW WE, US


[Captioner] 19:38:25
HINDUS ARE BETTER THAN OTHERS


[Captioner] 19:38:27
AND HOW WE ARE ALWAYS ABLE TO


[Captioner] 19:38:30
GET THE POSITION WE WANT SUCH AS


[Captioner] 19:38:33
A CEO OR MAYOR, FOR EXAMPLE, IN


[Captioner] 19:38:36
THIS SOCIETY AS OPPOSED TO OTHER
HINDUS.


[Captioner] 19:38:41
AND I MAY NOT KNOW MUCH ABOUT


[Captioner] 19:38:43
THIS ISSUE, AS MY FELLOW


[Captioner] 19:38:45
ASSOCIATES HERE, BUT I DO KNOW


[Captioner] 19:38:47
THAT WE ARE BEING TARGETED BY
OTHERS.


[Captioner] 19:38:51
AND THIS IS WHY I SAY NO TO


[Captioner] 19:38:54
PROPOSITION SB403 AND STOP ALL


[Captioner] 19:38:54
HINDU HATE.


[Captioner] 19:38:55
THANK YOU, MAYOR AND CITY
COUNCIL.


[Captioner] 19:38:56
[APPLAUSE]


[Captioner] 19:38:59
>> Ms. Gauthier: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:39:02
SRINAS FOLLOWED BY HARSH SINGH.


[Captioner] 19:39:05
>> THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME THIS


[Captioner] 19:39:06
OPPORTUNITY, MAYOR AND
COUNCILMEMBERS.


[Captioner] 19:39:10
I'M HERE TO TALK ABOUT SB403.


[Captioner] 19:39:11
AND THE REASON I'M HERE IS


[Captioner] 19:39:13
BECAUSE I'M CONCERNED ABOUT MY
KIDS.


[Captioner] 19:39:14
I HAVE TWO KIDS WHO ARE GOING


[Captioner] 19:39:15
HERE IN FREMONT.


[Captioner] 19:39:19
AND THE MOMENT I HEAR ABOUT THIS


[Captioner] 19:39:22
SB403, I FEEL LIKE, YOU KNOW,


[Captioner] 19:39:24
RIGHT NOW MY KIDS DON'T KNOW


[Captioner] 19:39:27
WHAT CASTE IS, AND WHAT CASTE WE


[Captioner] 19:39:28
BELONG OR WHAT CASTE THEIR


[Captioner] 19:39:28
FRIENDS BELONG TO.


[Captioner] 19:39:32
SO IT'S NOT EVEN A POINT OF


[Captioner] 19:39:33
DISCUSSION RIGHT NOW.


[Captioner] 19:39:36
BUT BECAUSE OF THIS SB403, I'M


[Captioner] 19:39:38
FEARING THAT THIS COMES INTO THE


[Captioner] 19:39:40
DISCUSSION AND THEY HAVE TO


[Captioner] 19:39:41
IDENTIFY WITH THEIR CASTE AND


[Captioner] 19:39:43
THAT KIND OF BRINGS A


[Captioner] 19:39:47
DISCRIMINATION WHICH IS UNWANTED


[Captioner] 19:39:49
AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S


[Captioner] 19:39:51
BEEN LEFT IN INDIA AND IT'S NOT


[Captioner] 19:39:52
RELEVANT HERE FOR THE FUTURE


[Captioner] 19:39:53
GENERATION OF AMERICA.


[Captioner] 19:39:55
AND I THINK THIS SHOULD BE


[Captioner] 19:39:59
OPPOSED AND I REQUEST


[Captioner] 19:40:00
COUNCILMEMBERS HERE IN FREMONT


[Captioner] 19:40:02
TO PASS A RESOLUTION RELATED TO
THIS.


[Captioner] 19:40:04
THANK YOU.

MUCH FOR GIVING ME THE


[Captioner] 19:40:17
OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK HERE.


[Captioner] 19:40:20
YOU HEARD ENOUGH ABOUT SB403,


[Captioner] 19:40:22
HOW IT IS RACIST PROFILES AND


[Captioner] 19:40:22
EVERYTHING ELSE.


[Captioner] 19:40:24
I WOULD LIKE TO ACTUALLY ADDRESS


[Captioner] 19:40:27
THE COMMENTS OF THE PREVIOUS


[Captioner] 19:40:29
GENTLEMAN REGARDING CASTEISM


[Captioner] 19:40:30
EXISTING IN AMERICA AND HOW HE


[Captioner] 19:40:31
HAS BEEN DISCRIMINATED AGAINST


[Captioner] 19:40:32
ON THE BASIS OF CASTE.


[Captioner] 19:40:35
WHILE THAT MIGHT BE TRUE AND I'M


[Captioner] 19:40:37
REALLY APOLOGETIC AND I FEEL FOR


[Captioner] 19:40:38
THE GENTLEMAN AND HIS FAMILY IF


[Captioner] 19:40:40
THAT WAS THE CASE.


[Captioner] 19:40:41
WHAT I WANT TO SAY IS THAT


[Captioner] 19:40:42
CURRENT LAWS ARE ENOUGH TO


[Captioner] 19:40:42
ADDRESS THEM.


[Captioner] 19:40:45
YOU DON'T NEED TO PROFILE A


[Captioner] 19:40:46
CERTAIN COMMUNITY TO DO THAT.


[Captioner] 19:40:49
WE ARE AGAINST ALL SORTS OF


[Captioner] 19:40:50
DISCRIMINATION, AND WE BELIEVE


[Captioner] 19:40:52
IN NO DISCRIMINATION FOR ANYBODY


[Captioner] 19:40:54
REGARDLESS OF WHATEVER.


[Captioner] 19:40:58
HOWEVER, TO TARGET A CERTAIN


[Captioner] 19:41:01
COMMUNITY AND PROFILE THEM ON


[Captioner] 19:41:03
THE BASIS OF CASTE IS WHAT'S


[Captioner] 19:41:03
MORE DISCRIMINATING.


[Captioner] 19:41:05
SO IF YOU LOOK AT EVEN THIS CASE


[Captioner] 19:41:08
THAT'S ADDRESSED BY SB403 WHICH


[Captioner] 19:41:11
SAYS HEY, GO FILE A LAWSUIT,


[Captioner] 19:41:13
THAT'S A LAWSUIT, NOTHING PROVEN


[Captioner] 19:41:14
AND THERE'S NOTHING WILL BE


[Captioner] 19:41:14
PROVEN IN THE FUTURE.


[Captioner] 19:41:16
THAT CANNOT BE USED AS EVIDENCE


[Captioner] 19:41:17
FOR DISCRIMINATION.


[Captioner] 19:41:21
SO ABSOLUTELY AGREE, NO


[Captioner] 19:41:22
DISCRIMINATION OF ANY FORM


[Captioner] 19:41:23
SHOULD EVER, EVER EXIST.


[Captioner] 19:41:27
AND THIS LAW OR THIS BILL


[Captioner] 19:41:30
ACTUALLY PROFILES US AND


[Captioner] 19:41:31
DISCRIMINATES AGAINST US.


[Captioner] 19:41:33
SO NOW COMING BACK TO THE ISSUE,


[Captioner] 19:41:36
WE HAVE SEEN MANY HINDUPHOBIC


[Captioner] 19:41:36
EVENTS INSIDE FREMONT.


[Captioner] 19:41:38
WE HEARD ONE FROM ONE GENTLEMAN


[Captioner] 19:41:40
TODAY PLUS WE KNOW ABOUT THE


[Captioner] 19:41:40
OTHER CASE.


[Captioner] 19:41:42
WE ARE SEEING ATTACKS


[Captioner] 19:41:44
CONTINUOUSLY IN OUR COMMUNITY BY


[Captioner] 19:41:45
ORGANIZATIONS LIKE QUALITY
LABS.


[Captioner] 19:41:47
WE NEED TO BE PROTECTED IN THIS


[Captioner] 19:41:48
CITY, WHICH I HAVE BEEN A


[Captioner] 19:41:49
RESIDENT FOR 25 YEARS.


[Captioner] 19:41:53
I WANT A RESOLUTION ON
HINDUPHOBIA.


[Captioner] 19:41:55
JUST LIKE THE STATE OF GEORGIA


[Captioner] 19:41:57
PASSED ONE, WE AS A COMMUNITY


[Captioner] 19:42:00
HERE IN WHICH WE ARE LARGE


[Captioner] 19:42:01
CONTRIBUTING COMMUNITY, THIS


[Captioner] 19:42:03
SOCIETY, WE DESERVE A
RESOLUTION.


[Captioner] 19:42:06
ALSO, I WOULD REQUEST THE


[Captioner] 19:42:08
COUNCILMEMBERS TO COME OUT IN


[Captioner] 19:42:10
SUPPORT FOR US AND SAY THAT


[Captioner] 19:42:11
THEY'RE AGAINST SB403.


[Captioner] 19:42:13
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.


[Captioner] 19:42:14
>> Ms. Gauthier: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:42:18
THE NEXT SPEAKER IS JIRAJ SINGH


[Captioner] 19:42:19
FOLLOWED BY KELLY ABREU.


[Captioner] 19:42:21
>> HELLO, EVERYBODY.


[Captioner] 19:42:23
SO MOST OF THE THINGS HAVE


[Captioner] 19:42:24
ALREADY BEEN COVERED SO FAR.


[Captioner] 19:42:29
SO I'M HERE TO OPPOSE SB403.


[Captioner] 19:42:32
I JUST FEEL THAT THIS IS A VERY


[Captioner] 19:42:38
SINISTER DESIGNED TO PUT A WEDGE


[Captioner] 19:42:39
IN THE HINDU COMMUNITY.


[Captioner] 19:42:42
LARGELY WE DON'T PRACTICE ANY


[Captioner] 19:42:42
CASTEISM WHATSOEVER.


[Captioner] 19:42:44
NEVER HEARD OF IT.


[Captioner] 19:42:47
IF ANYBODY HAS BEEN EVER


[Captioner] 19:42:53
DISCRIMINATED BY WAY OF CASTE,


[Captioner] 19:42:55
IF AT ALL I HAVE TO DEFEND HIM,


[Captioner] 19:42:57
I'LL DEFINITELY DEFEND WHENEVER


[Captioner] 19:42:57
IT'S POSSIBLE.


[Captioner] 19:43:00
THERE ARE ALREADY SO MANY


[Captioner] 19:43:01
DISCRIMINATORY LAWS AVAILABLE TO


[Captioner] 19:43:03
PROTECT AGAINST ANY KIND OF


[Captioner] 19:43:04
DISCRIMINATION AND I WILL BE THE


[Captioner] 19:43:05
FIRST ONE TO EVER POINT IT OUT


[Captioner] 19:43:06
IF I SEE IT HAPPEN.


[Captioner] 19:43:08
BUT THIS PARTICULAR BILL


[Captioner] 19:43:10
ACTUALLY POINTS OUT AND PROFILES


[Captioner] 19:43:12
HINDUS, AND THE ONLY WAY IT WILL


[Captioner] 19:43:14
BE IMPLEMENTED IS BY CALLING OUT


[Captioner] 19:43:16
THAT THIS IS A HIGH CASTE, THIS


[Captioner] 19:43:18
IS A LOW CASTE, AND THE


[Captioner] 19:43:18
DISCRIMINATION HAS BEEN DONE.


[Captioner] 19:43:20
SO BASICALLY THIS PROFILING IS


[Captioner] 19:43:22
WHAT I'M REALLY SCARED OF, AND


[Captioner] 19:43:25
THIS IS GOING TO BE -- TURNING


[Captioner] 19:43:27
OUT REALLY BAD IN THE FUTURE IF


[Captioner] 19:43:28
IT'S IMPLEMENTED SO I'M AGAINST
IT.


[Captioner] 19:43:29
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:43:30
[APPLAUSE]


[Captioner] 19:43:37
>> Ms. Gauthier: KELLY ABREU,


[Captioner] 19:43:40
FOLLOWED BY ARUNI RAU.


[Captioner] 19:43:41
>> THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:43:44
I WANT TO FOCUS IN ON PICKERING


[Captioner] 19:43:46
AVENUE AND MORRISON CANYON
ROAD.


[Captioner] 19:43:49
THE CITY WAS INTERESTED IN


[Captioner] 19:43:51
OPENING -- FORMALLY OPENING A


[Captioner] 19:43:52
GATE AT PICKERING AVENUE IN


[Captioner] 19:43:54
ORDER TO ALLOW ACCESS TO VARGAS


[Captioner] 19:43:56
PLATEAU REGIONAL PARK.


[Captioner] 19:43:59
THEY WENT SO FAR AS TO SEND OUT


[Captioner] 19:44:02
LETTERS TO TWO DOZEN OF THE


[Captioner] 19:44:04
NEAREST HOMEOWNERS NEAREST THE
GATE.


[Captioner] 19:44:06
KIND OF LIKE IF YOU GO TO A


[Captioner] 19:44:09
SCHOOL AND SEND OUT LETTERS


[Captioner] 19:44:11
ASKING HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THE


[Captioner] 19:44:12
TRAFFIC SITUATION WITHIN HALF A


[Captioner] 19:44:15
BLOCK OF YOUR SCHOOL?


[Captioner] 19:44:17
WE WOULD SHUT DOWN EVERY SCHOOL


[Captioner] 19:44:18
IF WE DID THAT.


[Captioner] 19:44:20
BECAUSE EVERY SCHOOL IS A


[Captioner] 19:44:23
TRAFFIC DISASTER.


[Captioner] 19:44:27
SAME WITH EVERY PARK.


[Captioner] 19:44:29
SO THE CITY CAREFULLY CHOSE --


[Captioner] 19:44:31
THEY COULD HAVE SENT THIS OUT TO


[Captioner] 19:44:31
HUNDREDS, THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE


[Captioner] 19:44:33
BUT NO, ONLY TWO DOZEN.


[Captioner] 19:44:36
AND THEY NOW ARE GETTING SOME


[Captioner] 19:44:39
FEEDBACK, SOME FEEDBACK, BUT


[Captioner] 19:44:42
BEFORE WE GET INTO THAT, WHY


[Captioner] 19:44:43
WOULD THIS BE HAPPENING NOW?


[Captioner] 19:44:46
THE CITY TRAFFIC ENGINEERING


[Captioner] 19:44:47
DEPARTMENT SEEMS TO HAVE


[Captioner] 19:44:49
FORGOTTEN ITS ROLE, ITS ROLE IN


[Captioner] 19:44:50
SHUTTING DOWN ACCESS TO THIS


[Captioner] 19:44:53
PARK OR LIMITING ACCESS TO THIS


[Captioner] 19:44:53
PARK, WHY?


[Captioner] 19:44:55
BECAUSE MORRISON CANYON ROAD IS


[Captioner] 19:44:57
CLOSED RIGHT NOW DUE TO NATURAL
DISASTERS.


[Captioner] 19:44:58
AND IT'S BEEN CLOSED FOR
MONTHS.


[Captioner] 19:45:02
AND UNTIL THAT ROAD IS


[Captioner] 19:45:04
RE-OPENED, IT'S NOT A ROAD, IT'S


[Captioner] 19:45:05
A TRAIL, WE NEED THAT TRAIL TO


[Captioner] 19:45:08
BE RE-OPENED IN ORDER TO ALLOW


[Captioner] 19:45:09
PEOPLE TO VISIT THE PARK MORE
EASILY.


[Captioner] 19:45:11
AND TO WALK IN THE NATURE.


[Captioner] 19:45:16
SO FOR YOUR STAFF TO TURN AROUND


[Captioner] 19:45:18
AND SAY THERE IS NO PROJECT OR


[Captioner] 19:45:20
NO STUDIES RELATING TO THIS


[Captioner] 19:45:22
ITEM, WE'RE JUST EXPLORING,


[Captioner] 19:45:26
WANTING TO OBTAIN FEEDBACK, YOUR


[Captioner] 19:45:28
STAFF IS TRYING TO COVER UP,


[Captioner] 19:45:30
HIDE, RUN AWAY FROM THIS IDEA OF


[Captioner] 19:45:31
OPENING THE GATE.


[Captioner] 19:45:35
YOU NEED TO GET OUT THERE AND


[Captioner] 19:45:37
REPAIR THAT WALKING TRAIL ON


[Captioner] 19:45:37
MORRISON CANYON ROAD.


[Captioner] 19:45:40
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:45:41
[APPLAUSE]


[Captioner] 19:45:41
>> Ms. Gauthier: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:45:47
THE NEXT SPEAKER IS ARUNI RAO.


[Captioner] 19:45:54
>> HELLO, EVERYONE.


[Captioner] 19:45:54
GOOD EVENING.


[Captioner] 19:45:56
MY NAME IS ARUNI.


[Captioner] 19:45:59
I ACTUALLY AM A CITIZEN OF THE


[Captioner] 19:45:59
UNITED STATES.


[Captioner] 19:46:03
I WAS BORN AND BROUGHT UP HERE.


[Captioner] 19:46:05
AND TODAY I WANT TO SPEAK


[Captioner] 19:46:08
AGAINST THE SB403 BILL.


[Captioner] 19:46:11
SO I GO TO A JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL


[Captioner] 19:46:12
RIGHT HERE.


[Captioner] 19:46:15
MY FRIENDS, I HAVE FRIENDS FROM


[Captioner] 19:46:16
ALL DIFFERENT RACES, ALL


[Captioner] 19:46:17
DIFFERENT CATEGORIES, YOU A


[Captioner] 19:46:18
DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS.


[Captioner] 19:46:23
NOT ONCE EVER HAVE WE EVER


[Captioner] 19:46:25
TALKED ABOUT CASTE


[Captioner] 19:46:26
DISCRIMINATION, NOTHING LIKE
THAT.


[Captioner] 19:46:32
SO I FEEL LIKE THIS BILL, IF


[Captioner] 19:46:37
IT'S PASSED, I'M SCARED ABOUT MY


[Captioner] 19:46:38
FUTURE BECAUSE IF I EVER GO TO


[Captioner] 19:46:41
COLLEGE, WILL IT BE LIKE, OH,


[Captioner] 19:46:42
YOUR CASTE, WHAT'S YOUR CASTE?


[Captioner] 19:46:44
AND THEY WILL DISCRIMINATE ON ME


[Captioner] 19:46:44
AGAINST THAT.


[Captioner] 19:46:48
I DON'T WANT THAT TO HAPPEN TO


[Captioner] 19:46:52
ME OR ANYONE LIKE THAT.


[Captioner] 19:46:54
IF THIS BILL IS PASSED, IT'S


[Captioner] 19:46:55
JUST GOING TO ADD MORE


[Captioner] 19:46:58
DISCRIMINATION, MORE ANTI-HINDU


[Captioner] 19:47:00
HATE, AND I DON'T WANT THAT TO


[Captioner] 19:47:03
BE HERE IN AMERICA.


[Captioner] 19:47:06
, BECAUSE THIS IS AGAINST ALL


[Captioner] 19:47:07
DISCRIMINATION AND IF THIS BILL


[Captioner] 19:47:10
IS PASSED, I DON'T THINK IT'S


[Captioner] 19:47:11
GOING TO ACHIEVE THAT GOAL OF


[Captioner] 19:47:14
NOT HAVING ANY DISCRIMINATION.


[Captioner] 19:47:14
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:47:15
[APPLAUSE]

EVERYONE HERE MY EXPERIENCE AND


[Captioner] 19:47:59
WHAT THE CARPENTER'S UNION HAS


[Captioner] 19:48:00
DONE FOR MYSELF AND MY FAMILY.


[Captioner] 19:48:02
CONSTRUCTION APPRENTICESHIP


[Captioner] 19:48:03
PROGRAMS HAVE THE RESOURCES AND


[Captioner] 19:48:05
ABILITY TO LIFT OUR NEIGHBORS


[Captioner] 19:48:08
OUT OF POVERTY AND INTO A


[Captioner] 19:48:09
COMFORTABLE MIDDLE CLASS


[Captioner] 19:48:11

APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM THROUGH


[Captioner] 19:48:22

FEES BE TAKEN CARE OF, VETERANS


[Captioner] 19:48:28
CAN ALSO COLLECT THEIR G.I. BILL


[Captioner] 19:48:29
WHILE GOING THROUGH THE
PROGRAM.


[Captioner] 19:48:30
APPRENTICES GO THROUGH THE


[Captioner] 19:48:34
ENTIRE PROGRAM WITHOUT OWING


[Captioner] 19:48:34
A DIME.


[Captioner] 19:48:35

[Captioner] 19:48:47
MISSIONS OF THE CARPENTER'S
UNION.


[Captioner] 19:48:49
THE CARPENTER'S UNION ALSO


[Captioner] 19:48:51
OFFERS AN EXCELLENT HEALTHCARE


[Captioner] 19:48:53
PROGRAM WHERE SADLY SO MANY


[Captioner] 19:48:54
WORKERS HAVE NONE.


[Captioner] 19:48:55
THESE WORKERS HAVE TO RELY


[Captioner] 19:48:57
MAINLY ON SOCIAL PROGRAMS AND


[Captioner] 19:48:59
OVERLY TAXED EMERGENCY ROOMS.


[Captioner] 19:49:02

[Captioner] 19:49:03
PLAYING VARSITY FOOTBALL, HE


[Captioner] 19:49:05
TORE A LIGAMENT IN HIS HAND AND


[Captioner] 19:49:07
LOST MOTOR FUNCTIONS OF ONE OF


[Captioner] 19:49:07
HIS FINGERS.


[Captioner] 19:49:09
MY SON HAD THE MEDICAL COVERAGE


[Captioner] 19:49:10
TO REPAIR HIS HAND AND BRING HIM


[Captioner] 19:49:13
BACK TO 100% FUNCTIONALITY


[Captioner] 19:49:13

[Captioner] 19:49:47

[Captioner] 19:49:49
GOOD EVENING.


[Captioner] 19:49:51
I HAVE BEEN A U.S. CITIZEN FOR


[Captioner] 19:49:55
49 YEARS, AND A RESIDENT OF


[Captioner] 19:49:56
FREMONT FOR 40 YEARS.


[Captioner] 19:49:58
I'VE RAISED MY KIDS HERE AND NOW


[Captioner] 19:50:01
MY GRANDKIDS ARE HERE.


[Captioner] 19:50:03
AND IN MY 49 YEARS IN THE U.S.,


[Captioner] 19:50:05
IN MY PROFESSIONAL AND PERSONAL


[Captioner] 19:50:07
LIFE, CASTE HAS NEVER COME UP,


[Captioner] 19:50:09
NEVER ONCE COME UP.


[Captioner] 19:50:13
I ASKED MY SON WHEN ALL THIS


[Captioner] 19:50:15
CASTE NONSENSE STARTED, I SAID,


[Captioner] 19:50:16
HEY, DO YOU KNOW WHAT CASTE --


[Captioner] 19:50:17
HAVE WE EVER TALKED ABOUT CASTE


[Captioner] 19:50:18
AT HOME?


[Captioner] 19:50:20
AND HE SAID, NO, MOM, WE NEVER
DID.


[Captioner] 19:50:23
AND NOW I HAVE A WONDERFUL,


[Captioner] 19:50:24
BEAUTIFUL CAUCASIAN


[Captioner] 19:50:26
DAUGHTER-IN-LAW AND MY GRANDKIDS


[Captioner] 19:50:26
ARE MIXED KIDS.


[Captioner] 19:50:28
ADORABLE, ABSOLUTELY ADORABLE.


[Captioner] 19:50:32
HOW WOULD YOU ASSIGN A CASTE TO


[Captioner] 19:50:32
THEM?


[Captioner] 19:50:34
HOW WOULD YOU ASSIGN PEOPLE WHO


[Captioner] 19:50:36
DON'T KNOW THEIR CASTE, A CASTE


[Captioner] 19:50:36
TO THEM?


[Captioner] 19:50:37
WHAT KINDS OF QUESTIONS WOULD


[Captioner] 19:50:37
YOU ASK?


[Captioner] 19:50:40
YOU SEE THIS RABBIT HOLE THAT


[Captioner] 19:50:42
IT'S GOING DOWN IN?


[Captioner] 19:50:46
SO PLEASE, PLEASE VOTE NO ON


[Captioner] 19:50:48
SB403, AND SINCE WE ARE ALL


[Captioner] 19:50:51
FREMONT RESIDENTS, I URGE THE


[Captioner] 19:50:54
CITY COUNCIL TO LOOK INTO THIS


[Captioner] 19:50:56
HIGHLY DISPARAGING AND


[Captioner] 19:50:58
INFLAMMATORY BILL BECAUSE IT


[Captioner] 19:50:58
DIVIDES PEOPLE.


[Captioner] 19:51:00
AND IF I HAVE NOT HEARD CASTE


[Captioner] 19:51:03
ONCE IN MY PERSONAL PROFESSIONAL


[Captioner] 19:51:05
LIFE IN 49 YEARS, HOW COULD


[Captioner] 19:51:07
SOMEBODY SAY THERE IS CASTE
HERE?


[Captioner] 19:51:09
HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?


[Captioner] 19:51:13
AND THEY SAY BASED ON ONE CASE,


[Captioner] 19:51:16
THE CISCO CASE IS NOW STILL IN


[Captioner] 19:51:19
THE LEGAL LIMBO AFTER THREE


[Captioner] 19:51:19
YEARS.


[Captioner] 19:51:23
AND IT WAS BASED ON A FAULTY


[Captioner] 19:51:28
STUDY BY EQUALITY LABS WHICH


[Captioner] 19:51:32
WAS SHOT DOWN BY A MUCH MORE


[Captioner] 19:51:32
REPUTABLE ORGANIZATION.


[Captioner] 19:51:34
SO THIS IS A HATE BILL.


[Captioner] 19:51:37
THIS IS ABSOLUTELY A HATE BILL


[Captioner] 19:51:38
THAT SHOULD NOT SEE THE
DAYLIGHT.


[Captioner] 19:51:40
SO PLEASE VOTE NO.


[Captioner] 19:51:41
I STRONGLY OPPOSE IT.


[Captioner] 19:51:44
THANK YOU SO MUCH.


[Captioner] 19:51:49
>> Ms. Gauthier: WE'RE GOING


[Captioner] 19:51:50
BACK TO THE CARDS.


[Captioner] 19:51:52
THE NEXT SPEAKER IS J.T.


[Captioner] 19:51:57
FOLLOWED BY HERMESH SIDHU.


[Captioner] 19:51:57
G.T.


[Captioner] 19:52:01
>> HI.


[Captioner] 19:52:03
I WANTED TO KEEP IT SHORT.


[Captioner] 19:52:09
FIRST OF ALL I'M ACTUALLY A


[Captioner] 19:52:10
COMMISSIONER IN THE CITY OF


[Captioner] 19:52:11
CUPERTINO BUT I'M HERE IN MY


[Captioner] 19:52:13
PRIVATE CAPACITY, AS A PUBLIC
MEMBER.


[Captioner] 19:52:16
AND THE REASON I'M HERE IS


[Captioner] 19:52:18
BECAUSE I WAS ASKED TO JOIN A


[Captioner] 19:52:20
PARTICULAR RALLY HERE, AND I


[Captioner] 19:52:24
JUST GOT -- IT'S TOO LONG A


[Captioner] 19:52:26
DRIVE, FIRST OF ALL, I WANT TO


[Captioner] 19:52:30
THANK HONORABLE MEI, OUR CITY


[Captioner] 19:52:32
MANAGER, AND CITY ATTORNEY AND


[Captioner] 19:52:34
CITY CLERK AND ALL THE
COUNCILMEMBERS.


[Captioner] 19:52:36
THANK YOU FOR GIVING US THE


[Captioner] 19:52:37
OPPORTUNITY TO TALK BECAUSE THIS


[Captioner] 19:52:39
IS A VERY CRITICAL ISSUE.


[Captioner] 19:52:40
I'VE BEEN HERE IN THE UNITED


[Captioner] 19:52:41
STATES FOR 30 YEARS.


[Captioner] 19:52:44
MOST OF MY CLASSMATES CAME HERE


[Captioner] 19:52:44
45 YEARS AGO.


[Captioner] 19:52:49
AND MANY OF THEM HAVE MARRIED TO


[Captioner] 19:52:50
PEOPLE WHO ARE LOCALLY HERE.


[Captioner] 19:52:53
I MYSELF, THOUGH I'M FROM INDIA,


[Captioner] 19:52:55
I'VE BEEN A U.S. CITIZEN FOR


[Captioner] 19:53:03
QUITE SOME TIME, I HAVE A --


[Captioner] 19:53:04
CHRISTIAN AS MY DAUGHTER-IN-LAW


[Captioner] 19:53:06
IN INDIA, JUST HAPPENED DURING


[Captioner] 19:53:11
THE PANDEMIC, MY NEPHEW MARRIED


[Captioner] 19:53:12
A -- CHRISTIAN.


[Captioner] 19:53:13
THIS IS GOING ON IN INDIA.


[Captioner] 19:53:16
A NEIGHBOR OF MINE, SHE LIVES IN


[Captioner] 19:53:18
VANCOUVER, MARRIED TO ANOTHER
CHRISTIAN.


[Captioner] 19:53:20
SO WE ARE ALL TOTALLY GETTING


[Captioner] 19:53:22
MIXED UP, EVERYWHERE, IN TERMS


[Captioner] 19:53:25
OF NOT LOOKING AT THINGS LIKE


[Captioner] 19:53:26
EVEN WHETHER WE'RE HINDUS OR
NOT.


[Captioner] 19:53:30
I MEAN, RELIGION ITSELF HAS


[Captioner] 19:53:31
BECOME SOMETHING WHICH IS NOT


[Captioner] 19:53:31
THE MAIN CONSIDERATION.


[Captioner] 19:53:35
SO I THINK IN A CERTAIN SETTING,


[Captioner] 19:53:38
TRYING TO BRING SOMETHING SO


[Captioner] 19:53:41
DIVISIVE, YOU GO TO ANY COUNTRY,


[Captioner] 19:53:42
THERE'S SUBDIVISION, IT IS


[Captioner] 19:53:43
THERE, IT CANNOT GO AWAY.


[Captioner] 19:53:46
SO WHY SHOULD WE ACTUALLY HANG


[Captioner] 19:53:48
ON TO THAT -- LOOK AT THE BILL,


[Captioner] 19:53:52
ALL THE RED LINE, THE BLUE PART,


[Captioner] 19:53:56
IT IS NOT SOMETHING WHICH AN


[Captioner] 19:53:58
ORDINARY AMERICAN WILL BE ABLE


[Captioner] 19:53:59
TO UNDERSTAND AT ALL BECAUSE IT


[Captioner] 19:54:00
IS NOT THE LINGO THAT GOES ON
HERE.


[Captioner] 19:54:02
>> Ms. Gauthier: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:54:08
THE NEXT SPEAKER IS HERMESH


[Captioner] 19:54:09
SYDHU.


[Captioner] 19:54:17
>> GOOD EVENING, DISTINGUISHED


[Captioner] 19:54:19
PERSONALITIES AND MY FELLOW
CITIZENS.


[Captioner] 19:54:22
ALL OF THEM SPOKE, I WOULD SAY


[Captioner] 19:54:27
MAJORITY EXCEPT KAWAL SINGH


[Captioner] 19:54:29
SPOKE AGAINST SB403 AND I'M


[Captioner] 19:54:31
STANDING HERE IN SUPPORT OF 
SB403.


[Captioner] 19:54:36
SB403 IS A BILL, IT IS NOT GOING


[Captioner] 19:54:38
TO TAKE AWAY ANYTHING FROM YOU


[Captioner] 19:54:41
GUYS AS A COMMUNITY.


[Captioner] 19:54:42
 -- PHOBIA.


[Captioner] 19:54:44
I CAN GIVE YOU ONE EXAMPLE, THE


[Captioner] 19:54:46
CASTE BASED DISCRIMINATION.


[Captioner] 19:54:47
IT'S A BIG EXAMPLE.


[Captioner] 19:54:49
PRESIDENT OF INDIA WAS NOT


[Captioner] 19:54:50
ALLOWED TO ENTER INTO A TEMPLE.


[Captioner] 19:54:52
COUPLE OF YEARS AGO.


[Captioner] 19:54:56
IT'S NOT -- IT'S NOT A FAKE.


[Captioner] 19:54:57
>> Mayor Mei: EXCUSE ME.


[Captioner] 19:54:59
I NEED TO CALL AN ORDER.


[Captioner] 19:55:02
WE'RE GOING TO BE RESPECTFUL


[Captioner] 19:55:05
WHEN ONE PERSON IS SPEAKING, SO


[Captioner] 19:55:06
WE WOULD -- EXCUSE ME.


[Captioner] 19:55:09
WE CANNOT SHOUT OVER ONE
ANOTHER.


[Captioner] 19:55:11
WE WANT TO BE RESPECTFUL WHEN


[Captioner] 19:55:13
ANYONE ELSE IS SPEAKING, WE WANT


[Captioner] 19:55:15
TO ALLOW PEOPLE THE EQUAL
RESPECT.


[Captioner] 19:55:17
>> THIS SHOWS THE CHARACTER


[Captioner] 19:55:17
ACTUALLY LIKE WHAT IT IS.


[Captioner] 19:55:18
YOU KNOW?


[Captioner] 19:55:21
IT IS JUST TO -- THE SB403 IS


[Captioner] 19:55:23
GOING TO PROVIDE A PROTECTION SO


[Captioner] 19:55:25
THE PEOPLE DON'T FEEL
DISCRIMINATED.


[Captioner] 19:55:26
IT IS BOTH WAYS.


[Captioner] 19:55:29
IF I'M ON TOP OF THE -- I KNOW,


[Captioner] 19:55:31
I CAN'T DISCRIMINATE YOU GUYS


[Captioner] 19:55:32
TOO SO YOU GUYS HAVE THE


[Captioner] 19:55:33
PROTECTION TO.


[Captioner] 19:55:34
 TOO.


[Captioner] 19:55:36
SO I AM REQUESTING YOU GUYS


[Captioner] 19:55:38
BEING CITIZEN OF THIS PARTICULAR


[Captioner] 19:55:40
CITY THAT PLEASE SAY YES ON
403.


[Captioner] 19:55:40
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.


[Captioner] 19:55:43
>> Ms. Gauthier: THE NEXT


[Captioner] 19:55:48
SPEAKER IS SRIKANT PINYALA


[Captioner] 19:55:48
FOLLOWED BY JOANN.


[Captioner] 19:55:53
>> THANK YOU, MAYOR, FOR GIVING


[Captioner] 19:55:54
ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK


[Captioner] 19:55:54
ABOUT THIS.


[Captioner] 19:55:59
I'M AGAINST SB403 AND THE


[Captioner] 19:56:02
PREVIOUS GENTLEMAN WHATEVER HE


[Captioner] 19:56:04
EXPLAINED, I THINK SOME OF THE


[Captioner] 19:56:07
FALSE INFORMATION IS CIRCULATED


[Captioner] 19:56:10
ACROSS THE COUNTRY HERE AND EVEN
INTERNATIONALLY.


[Captioner] 19:56:15
SOME SITUATIONS, SOME INCIDENTS


[Captioner] 19:56:17
CANNOT BE, YOU KNOW, GENERALIZED


[Captioner] 19:56:17
ACROSS THE BOARD.


[Captioner] 19:56:22
THE CASTE SYSTEM -- I'M THE


[Captioner] 19:56:25
 PARENT OF TWO CHILDREN,


[Captioner] 19:56:27
I'VE BEEN LIVING IN FREMONT CITY


[Captioner] 19:56:30
FOR 10 YEARS, AND I NEVER -- NOW


[Captioner] 19:56:33
MY KIDS ARE GOING TO ELEMENTARY


[Captioner] 19:56:34
BUT OF COURSE 10 AND 12 YEARS


[Captioner] 19:56:36
AND I NEVER EXPLAINED THEM ABOUT


[Captioner] 19:56:36
THE CASTE SYSTEM.


[Captioner] 19:56:39
OR WHICH CASTE THEY BELONG TO.


[Captioner] 19:56:44
SO MOSTLY EVERYONE ARE LIKE --


[Captioner] 19:56:47
THEY THINK THEMSELVES AS


[Captioner] 19:56:50
VEGETARIANS, SO VEGETARIANS OR


[Captioner] 19:56:50
NON-VEGETARIANS, THAT'S THE ONLY


[Captioner] 19:56:51
DIFFERENCE THEY SEE.


[Captioner] 19:56:53
BY THIS CASTE SYSTEM,


[Captioner] 19:56:56
INTRODUCING THIS, DEFINITELY


[Captioner] 19:56:58
MAKES THEM -- WE HAVE TO -- IN


[Captioner] 19:57:00
THEIR CONSCIOUSNESS, WE HAVE TO


[Captioner] 19:57:04
TEACH THEM WHAT IS CASTE SYSTEM


[Captioner] 19:57:06
AND THIS DEFINITELY DIVIDES THE


[Captioner] 19:57:14
PEOPLE AND THE HINDU COMMUNITY


[Captioner] 19:57:19
THIS IS INTRODUCING
THE DISCRIMINATION.


[Captioner] 19:57:21
THERE IS NO REASON OF -- THE


[Captioner] 19:57:23
PURPOSE OF THIS IS -- THE PEOPLE


[Captioner] 19:57:26
WHO WANTS TO DIVIDE THIS WANT TO


[Captioner] 19:57:31
INTRODUCE THIS, AND EVEN MR. --


[Captioner] 19:57:32
MISS SENATOR, WHEN SHE


[Captioner] 19:57:36
INTRODUCED THIS SB403, I DON'T


[Captioner] 19:57:38
THINK SHE HAD ENOUGH DETAIL


[Captioner] 19:57:41
ABOUT THIS, BUT WE WANTED TO


[Captioner] 19:57:46
COMMUNICATE MANY TIMES BUT I


[Captioner] 19:57:48
THINK IF -- THE PREVIOUS


[Captioner] 19:57:49
GENTLEMAN HAS ALSO TOLD THAT WE


[Captioner] 19:57:53
ARE THREATENING THEM IF WE WANT


[Captioner] 19:57:54
TO --


[Captioner] 19:57:56
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:58:07
>> Ms. Gauthier: JOANN.


[Captioner] 19:58:12
>> Ms. Gauthier: DID WE


[Captioner] 19:58:17
ALREADY HAVE SRIKAR -- SORRY,


[Captioner] 19:58:17
JOANN, YOU'RE NEXT.


[Captioner] 19:58:18
>> HI.


[Captioner] 19:58:18
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:58:20
GOOD EVENING, COUNCILMEMBERS,


[Captioner] 19:58:22
MAYOR MEI, AND COMMUNITY
MEMBERS.


[Captioner] 19:58:27
ON THE TOPIC OF PROFILING AND


[Captioner] 19:58:37
DISCRIMINATION, SENATOR AISHA


[Captioner] 19:58:38
WAHAB DIDN'T GO FAR ENOUGH ON


[Captioner] 19:58:38
THIS BILL.


[Captioner] 19:58:44
I THINK IT SHOULD BE SCRAPPED


[Captioner] 19:58:46
COMPLETELY, HOWEVER I DO SEE


[Captioner] 19:58:47
THERE NEEDS TO BE A BILL PUT


[Captioner] 19:58:48
INTO PLACE FOR DISCRIMINATING


[Captioner] 19:58:52
AGAINST THE SOCIOECONOMIC


[Captioner] 19:58:56
DIVIDE, AND I SAY THAT ON BEHALF


[Captioner] 19:58:59
OF ALL UNHOUSED INDIVIDUALS, ALL


[Captioner] 19:59:04
LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS, FAMILIES


[Captioner] 19:59:06
AS WELL.


[Captioner] 19:59:11
AS I STATED, I MYSELF AM
UNHOUSED.


[Captioner] 19:59:14
I DO NOT CONSIDER MYSELF
HOMELESS.


[Captioner] 19:59:17
I AM HOUSELESS, I AM
HOME-ENGAGED.


[Captioner] 19:59:19
I WOULD LOVE TO GET INTO A REAL


[Captioner] 19:59:21
PLACE TO LIVE ONCE AGAIN.


[Captioner] 19:59:24
AS A 42-YEAR RESIDENT OF 


[Captioner] 19:59:27
FREMONT, I'VE BEEN UNHOUSED FOR


[Captioner] 19:59:29
4 1/2 YEARS, AND I SEE THAT


[Captioner] 19:59:32
THERE'S TOO MUCH DISCRIMINATION


[Captioner] 19:59:38
AGAINST THE UNHOUSED,


[Captioner] 19:59:39
ESPECIALLY AGAINST WOMEN AND


[Captioner] 19:59:40
SENIORS AND OUR VETERANS.


[Captioner] 19:59:45
THERE'S NO GOOD REASON OR EXCUSE


[Captioner] 19:59:47
WHY OUR VETERANS ARE UNHOUSED,
PERIOD.


[Captioner] 19:59:52
THERE'S NO GOOD EXCUSE WHY WOMEN


[Captioner] 19:59:53
ARE BEING ASSAULTED SUCH AS


[Captioner] 19:59:55
MYSELF, I'VE BEEN ATTACKED TWICE


[Captioner] 19:59:58
IN THE LAST 30 DAYS, ONCE


[Captioner] 20:00:01
PHYSICALLY AND JUST RECENTLY


[Captioner] 20:00:02
SEXUALLY ATTACKED IN MY OWN
MOTORHOME.


[Captioner] 20:00:04
THE POLICE DEPARTMENT NEEDS TO


[Captioner] 20:00:09
DO MORE TO CATCH THESE OTHER


[Captioner] 20:00:10
INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE UNHOUSED


[Captioner] 20:00:14
AND PUT THEM WHERE THEY BELONG,


[Captioner] 20:00:15
AND THEN COUNCILMEMBERS, YOU'VE


[Captioner] 20:00:17
GOT TO DO MORE TO FIND


[Captioner] 20:00:19
DEVELOPERS, PLEASE, THAT WILL


[Captioner] 20:00:21
BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR US,


[Captioner] 20:00:24
NOT JUST FOR THE MEDIAN INCOME,


[Captioner] 20:00:29
BUT FOR THE UNHOUSED THAT CAN


[Captioner] 20:00:31
PAY --


[Captioner] 20:00:32
>> Ms. Gauthier: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:00:32
[APPLAUSE]


[Captioner] 20:00:41
THE NEXT SPEAKER IS MALAYA
WORLEY.


[Captioner] 20:00:47
FOLLOWED BY SHIVA CODA.


[Captioner] 20:00:51
>> SO MY NAME IS MYLAYA.


[Captioner] 20:00:53
>> Ms. Gauthier: I'M SORRY.


[Captioner] 20:00:54
>> SO I'M 24 YEARS OLD.


[Captioner] 20:00:57
I'VE BEEN A RESIDENT OF UNION


[Captioner] 20:01:00
CITY FOR A REALLY LONG TIME,


[Captioner] 20:01:01
SINCE 2007, AND I JUST RECENTLY


[Captioner] 20:01:04
BECAME UNHOUSED DUE TO A TOXIC


[Captioner] 20:01:06
FAMILY SITUATION, SO I'VE BEEN


[Captioner] 20:01:09
LIVING IN FREMONT IN A VAN WITH


[Captioner] 20:01:11
MY DOGS FOR THE PAST THREE


[Captioner] 20:01:13
MONTHS, AND JUST TO PIGGY BACK


[Captioner] 20:01:15
OFF OF WHAT JOANN SAID, YES,


[Captioner] 20:01:16
THIS IS AN ISSUE, ESPECIALLY IN


[Captioner] 20:01:19
THE AREA THAT WE ARE LIVING A


[Captioner] 20:01:22
PART OF WITH DISCRIMINATION AND


[Captioner] 20:01:24
WOMEN AND ESPECIALLY PEOPLE OF


[Captioner] 20:01:26
MY AGE, THE PEOPLE THAT WERE


[Captioner] 20:01:29
BEING ATTACKED BY PHYSICALLY,


[Captioner] 20:01:31
EMOTIONALLY, VERBALLY, YOU KNOW,


[Captioner] 20:01:33
SEXUALLY AS JOANN SAID, THEY


[Captioner] 20:01:35
ARE, YOU KNOW, OLDER PEOPLE, AND


[Captioner] 20:01:37
PEOPLE WHO FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE A


[Captioner] 20:01:38
RUN OVER THE POLICE DEPARTMENT


[Captioner] 20:01:40
AND SO I FEEL LIKE THE POLICE,


[Captioner] 20:01:43
YES, THEY SHOULD BE DOING MORE,


[Captioner] 20:01:45
BUT BECAUSE WE LIVE IN THE PARK,


[Captioner] 20:01:48
THE PARK RANGERS


[Captioner] 20:01:50
ARE DOING AN AMAZING JOB,


[Captioner] 20:01:51
THEY'RE DOING WHAT THEY HAVE TO
DO.


[Captioner] 20:01:52
THE POLICE DEPARTMENT SHOULD BE


[Captioner] 20:01:55
IN CAHOOTS WITH THE RANGERS TO


[Captioner] 20:01:58
BE ABLE TO WEED OUT THESE


[Captioner] 20:01:59
INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE MAKING


[Captioner] 20:02:00
THINGS A LITTLE BIT DIFFICULT.


[Captioner] 20:02:05
AND I'VE WITNESSED A LOT WITHIN


[Captioner] 20:02:06
THE PAST THREE MONTHS OF ME


[Captioner] 20:02:12
LIVING IN THAT SITUATION, AND I


[Captioner] 20:02:14
HONESTLY DISLIKE IT VERY MUCH


[Captioner] 20:02:15
AND I FEEL LIKE THERE SHOULD BE


[Captioner] 20:02:16
A LOT MORE GOING ON THAT A LOT


[Captioner] 20:02:17
OF PEOPLE DON'T GET THE HELP


[Captioner] 20:02:22
THAT THEY NEED, AND I USED TO


[Captioner] 20:02:24
WORK FOR ABODE, ABODE SHELTER, I


[Captioner] 20:02:27
USED TO WORK FOR THE SUNRISE


[Captioner] 20:02:29
VILLAGE LOCATION IN WARM SPRINGS


[Captioner] 20:02:30
BEFORE I BECAME HOMELESS.


[Captioner] 20:02:32
THEY FIRED ME BECAUSE I LOST MY


[Captioner] 20:02:34
HOUSING, AND SO AFTER DEALING


[Captioner] 20:02:35
WITH THAT AND BEING IN THE


[Captioner] 20:02:36
SITUATION I'M IN AND STILL


[Captioner] 20:02:37
TRYING TO HELP THE PEOPLE THAT


[Captioner] 20:02:40
I'M SURROUNDED BY EVERY DAY, I


[Captioner] 20:02:43
FEEL LIKE THERE IS MORE OF


[Captioner] 20:02:45
OTHERS CAN DO AND, YOU KNOW,


[Captioner] 20:02:47
LIKE THE PEOPLE THAT COME IN TO


[Captioner] 20:02:52
THE PARK AND THEY FEEL


[Captioner] 20:02:52
DISCRIMINATED AGAINST.


[Captioner] 20:02:55
>> Ms. Gauthier: TIME IS UP.


[Captioner] 20:02:56
>> THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:02:57
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU FOR
SHARING.


[Captioner] 20:02:59
>> Ms. Gauthier: MAYOR, THAT'S


[Captioner] 20:02:59
YOUR 45 MINUTES.


[Captioner] 20:03:03
WE HAVE -- I HAVE TWO CARDS


[Captioner] 20:03:04
CURRENTLY IN FRONT OF ME.


[Captioner] 20:03:08
THIS IS -- THIS MAKES THREE


[Captioner] 20:03:09
CARDS, IF YOU WANT THIS TO BE


[Captioner] 20:03:10
THE LAST THREE.


[Captioner] 20:03:12
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY.


[Captioner] 20:03:15

DO WE HAVE ANY OTHER SPEAKERS
ONLINE?


[Captioner] 20:03:16
>> Ms. Gauthier: YES, WE HAVE


[Captioner] 20:03:16
ONE MORE ONLINE.


[Captioner] 20:03:17
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY.


[Captioner] 20:03:20
IF WE KEEP THAT TO THESE ARE THE


[Captioner] 20:03:21
LAST BECAUSE WE NEED TO GO BACK


[Captioner] 20:03:23
TO OUR REGULARLY SCHEDULED


[Captioner] 20:03:23
AGENDA ITEMS.


[Captioner] 20:03:29
SUE WE WILL TAKE SAROGE KUMAR ON
ZOOM.


[Captioner] 20:03:32
SAROJ.


[Captioner] 20:03:32
>> HI.


[Captioner] 20:03:34
CAN YOU HEAR ME?


[Captioner] 20:03:34
>> Mayor Mei: YES.


[Captioner] 20:03:39
>> SO FIRST OF ALL, THANK YOU


[Captioner] 20:03:40
FOR GIVING ME THE CHANCE TO


[Captioner] 20:03:41
PRESENT MY POINT OF VIEW.


[Captioner] 20:03:44
I HAVE BEEN A RESIDENT OF


[Captioner] 20:03:46
FREMONT EVER SINCE I CAME TO


[Captioner] 20:03:49
USA, WHICH IS 18 YEARS BACK, AND


[Captioner] 20:03:53
I'VE BEEN REALLY THANKFUL TO THE


[Captioner] 20:03:54
ALMIGHTY FOR PUTTING ME IN THIS


[Captioner] 20:03:56
PLACE THAT I CAN SEE ALL --


[Captioner] 20:04:00
PEOPLE FROM ALL PLACES, I CAN


[Captioner] 20:04:01
SEE PEOPLE FROM INDIA, DIFFERENT


[Captioner] 20:04:05
WALKS OF SOCIETIES, AND MY


[Captioner] 20:04:08
EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN INFORMALLY
GOOD.


[Captioner] 20:04:10
I DO ACKNOWLEDGE SOME OF THE


[Captioner] 20:04:13
CHALLENGES THAT MY NATIVE


[Captioner] 20:04:15
COUNTRY SOCIETY IN INDIA FACE,


[Captioner] 20:04:19
BUT I'M HAPPY TO SAY THAT MOST


[Captioner] 20:04:21
OF IT ARE NOT SEEING THAT IN MY


[Captioner] 20:04:22
ONLY EXPERIENCE AND BASED ON


[Captioner] 20:04:23
WHAT I'VE HEARD FROM MY FRIENDS,


[Captioner] 20:04:28
NONE OF THAT IS MOSTLY RELEVANT
HERE.


[Captioner] 20:04:30
SO I HAVE A DILEMMA ABOUT THIS


[Captioner] 20:04:36
BILL AND I WENT TO THE BILL LAST


[Captioner] 20:04:38
NIGHT AND WHAT I FIND


[Captioner] 20:04:38
OBJECTIONABLE MOST OF MY FRIENDS


[Captioner] 20:04:40
HAVE ALREADY SAID I WON'T REPEAT


[Captioner] 20:04:42
THAT BUT FEW THINGS WHICH ARE


[Captioner] 20:04:44
VERY ALARMING IS THE BILL ITSELF


[Captioner] 20:04:46
STARTS WITH THE PREMISE THAT A


[Captioner] 20:04:48
LOT OF DISCRIMINATION IS


[Captioner] 20:04:50
HAPPENING ON THE BASIS OF
CASTE.


[Captioner] 20:04:52
UNFORTUNATELY THERE IS NO


[Captioner] 20:04:52
EVIDENCE TO BACK IT UP.


[Captioner] 20:04:55
AND AS I WORKED THROUGH THIS


[Captioner] 20:04:57
SCENARIO IN MY MIND, THIS BILL


[Captioner] 20:05:00
IS GOING TO LEAD TO A LOT MORE


[Captioner] 20:05:02
DISCRIMINATION AS OUR KIDS WILL


[Captioner] 20:05:04
BE FORCED TO KNOW ABOUT WHAT THE


[Captioner] 20:05:08
CASTE MEANS, AND MOST ALARMING


[Captioner] 20:05:11
CONSEQUENCE WITH THAT, ANYONE


[Captioner] 20:05:14
CAN ACCUSE THAT THEY'RE BEING


[Captioner] 20:05:17
DISCRIMINATED AGAINST, AND THE


[Captioner] 20:05:19
ONUS OF DOING THAT WRONG WILL BE


[Captioner] 20:05:23
ON THE PERSON BEING ACCUSED,


[Captioner] 20:05:24
JUSTICE, AGAINST THE LAW OF


[Captioner] 20:05:26
NATIONAL JUSTICE, AND SO THE


[Captioner] 20:05:28
CASE FROM CISCO IS A GREAT
EXAMPLE.


[Captioner] 20:05:30
NOTHING HAS COME OUT IN THREE
YEARS.


[Captioner] 20:05:33
AND AS OTHERS, THERE ARE ENOUGH


[Captioner] 20:05:35
SAFEGUARDS AND RULES TO PREVENT


[Captioner] 20:05:38
ANY MISUSE, SO THE QUESTION --


[Captioner] 20:05:38
VOTE AGAINST THIS.


[Captioner] 20:05:40
>> Ms. Gauthier: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:05:43
THE LAST THREE SPEAKERS FOR


[Captioner] 20:05:45
SPEAKER CARDS IN PERSON ARE


[Captioner] 20:05:54
SHIVA KOTA, ABINOV VISSON AND


[Captioner] 20:05:56
GUYATRE.


[Captioner] 20:06:00
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:06:03
>> TO THE HONORABLE JURY HERE, I


[Captioner] 20:06:06
BOW MY HEAD TO WISH YOU THE VERY
BEST.


[Captioner] 20:06:11
SO I'M FIRMLY AGAINST SB403.


[Captioner] 20:06:15
AND I'D LIKE TO REALLY EXPLAIN


[Captioner] 20:06:17
AND POINT OUT THAT THE PRIME


[Captioner] 20:06:19
MINISTER OF THE GREAT COUNTRY


[Captioner] 20:06:21
FROM WHERE I COME IN, INDIA, IS


[Captioner] 20:06:25
FROM A LOWER CASTE.


[Captioner] 20:06:28
AND THE PRESIDENT OF INDIA IS


[Captioner] 20:06:29
FROM THE ABSOLUTE LOWER CASTE.


[Captioner] 20:06:33
SO WHEN WE HAVE THE TOP TWO


[Captioner] 20:06:35
HEADS OF A GREAT -- OF THE


[Captioner] 20:06:37
WORLD'S LARGEST DEMOCRACY IN THE


[Captioner] 20:06:40
WORLD REPRESENTING THE LOWEST


[Captioner] 20:06:43
CASTE OF THE COUNTRY, SO CALLED


[Captioner] 20:06:45
CASTE, YOU LIKE TO TAG IT,


[Captioner] 20:06:47
RIGHT, IT WOULD REALLY BE UNFAIR


[Captioner] 20:06:49
TO SAY THAT PEOPLE ARE BEING


[Captioner] 20:06:49
DISCRIMINATED AGAINST CASTE.


[Captioner] 20:06:53
SO I DON'T THINK I'M GOING TO


[Captioner] 20:06:56
TAKE UP THE MINUTES THAT ARE


[Captioner] 20:06:57
AVAILABLE TO ME BUT I JUST


[Captioner] 20:06:59
WANTED TO POINT OUT THOSE TWO


[Captioner] 20:07:01
FACTS, AND JUST SAY THAT YOU


[Captioner] 20:07:02
KNOW, WHEN SOMEBODY COMES HERE


[Captioner] 20:07:05
TO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,


[Captioner] 20:07:06
RIGHT, SO IT'S THE LAND OF
OPPORTUNITY.


[Captioner] 20:07:08
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE


[Captioner] 20:07:10
EXTREMELY TALENTED REGARDLESS OF


[Captioner] 20:07:10
THEIR CASTE.


[Captioner] 20:07:11
RIGHT?


[Captioner] 20:07:14
THEY CATCH A FLIGHT AND THEN


[Captioner] 20:07:16
THEY COME IN AND THEN THEY ARE


[Captioner] 20:07:18
EXTREMELY WELL EMPLOYED, WELL TO


[Captioner] 20:07:18
DO, RIGHT?


[Captioner] 20:07:22
AND THEN WHEN THAT HAPPENS DUE


[Captioner] 20:07:23
TO SOME POLITICAL DIFFERENCES


[Captioner] 20:07:25
WITHIN A GIVEN ORGANIZATION, IF


[Captioner] 20:07:26
PEOPLE WANT TO MAKE -- TAKE


[Captioner] 20:07:27
ADVANTAGE OF THEIR RESPECTIVE,


[Captioner] 20:07:29
YOU KNOW, SOCIOECONOMIC


[Captioner] 20:07:31
BACKGROUND THAT IS NOT RELEVANT


[Captioner] 20:07:33
IN THIS COUNTRY AND -- SORRY.


[Captioner] 20:07:34
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:07:39
>> YOU HAVE 30 SECONDS.


[Captioner] 20:07:41
>> I THINK I MADE MY POINT.


[Captioner] 20:07:41
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:07:42
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:07:42
[APPLAUSE]


[Captioner] 20:07:45



[Captioner] 20:07:48
>> Ms. Gauthier: ABINOV.


[Captioner] 20:07:49
GLL THANK YOU VERY MUCH LADIES


[Captioner] 20:07:50
AND GENTLEMEN FOR YOUR PATIENCE


[Captioner] 20:07:51
IN LISTENING TO US.


[Captioner] 20:07:53
I'VE BEEN IN THIS COUNTRY FOR


[Captioner] 20:07:54
ABOUT 25, 30 YEARS NOW.


[Captioner] 20:07:59
I HAVE TWO CHILDREN HERE, DOING


[Captioner] 20:08:00
PRETTY WELL NOT THANKS TO ME BUT


[Captioner] 20:08:01
THANKS TO THE SYSTEM OVER HERE.


[Captioner] 20:08:04
THEY ARE SELF-MOTIVATED,


[Captioner] 20:08:06
SELF-INSPIRED, BUT THAT APART, I


[Captioner] 20:08:07
JUST WANT TO POINT OUT THAT


[Captioner] 20:08:09
COMING TO THIS, YOU KNOW, ROOM


[Captioner] 20:08:11
TODAY, I HEARD ABOUT VARIOUS


[Captioner] 20:08:14
THINGS THAT YOU GUYS DISCUSSED.


[Captioner] 20:08:18
AMONG THAT, INCIDENTALLY, THE


[Captioner] 20:08:20
FACT THAT THERE ARE LAWS IN THIS


[Captioner] 20:08:21
COUNTRY ABOUT RACE, COLOR,


[Captioner] 20:08:21
NATIONAL ORIGIN.


[Captioner] 20:08:23
WE ALSO DISCUSSED ABOUT FAIR


[Captioner] 20:08:25
HOUSING, YOU KNOW, IN FACT MY


[Captioner] 20:08:27
HEART GOES OUT TO SOME OF THE


[Captioner] 20:08:29
FOLKS HERE WHO CAME UP ABOUT


[Captioner] 20:08:31
FAIR HOUSING ISSUES.


[Captioner] 20:08:37
I SEE THAT AS A MAJOR PROBLEM,


[Captioner] 20:08:38
YEAH, ANYWAY, THAT'S BESIDE THE
POINT.


[Captioner] 20:08:40
MY HEART ALSO GOES OUT TO THE


[Captioner] 20:08:44
COUPLE OF PEOPLE, I DON'T THINK


[Captioner] 20:08:46
THEY'RE HERE NOW, WHO ARE IN


[Captioner] 20:08:47
FAVOR OF THIS BILL.


[Captioner] 20:08:49
AND I WISH WE COULD HAVE DONE


[Captioner] 20:08:51
SOMETHING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT


[Captioner] 20:08:53
THEIR PROBLEM WAS AND WHY THEY


[Captioner] 20:08:54
ARE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL.


[Captioner] 20:08:59
SO BUT I DON'T HAVE A CHANCE TO


[Captioner] 20:09:00
DO THAT ONE ON ONE, I HOPE I GET


[Captioner] 20:09:01
A CHANCE.


[Captioner] 20:09:02
BUT THAT APART, WHEN I HEARD


[Captioner] 20:09:06
THIS ABOUT THIS BILL YESTERDAY,


[Captioner] 20:09:09
I DON'T KNOW -- I'VE BEEN SO


[Captioner] 20:09:10
HELPLESS ACTUALLY, I SAID WHAT


[Captioner] 20:09:11
AM I GOING TO DO ABOUT THIS AND


[Captioner] 20:09:15
I SAID IN MY MIND, I'M GOING TO


[Captioner] 20:09:16
DO -- TO DEATH, TO FIGURE OUT


[Captioner] 20:09:17
HOW DO WE STOP THIS BILL, AND


[Captioner] 20:09:18
WHY DO I SAY THAT?


[Captioner] 20:09:22
BECAUSE I THINK IT FORCES --


[Captioner] 20:09:24
CASTE IS AN ANTIQUATED -- I


[Captioner] 20:09:26
THINK SO MANY PEOPLE IN THIS


[Captioner] 20:09:27
ROOM HAVE TALKED ENOUGH ABOUT


[Captioner] 20:09:29
IT, HOW IT'S AN ANTIQUATED


[Captioner] 20:09:31
COLONIAL MINDSET THAT HAS BEEN,


[Captioner] 20:09:32
YOU KNOW, INSTALLED UPON US.


[Captioner] 20:09:35
IT'S NOT THE TIME, WE HAD TO BE


[Captioner] 20:09:37
PROGRESSIVE, RIGHT?


[Captioner] 20:09:42
I WORK, I GET UP AT 2:00 A.M., I


[Captioner] 20:09:43
WORK UNTIL 10:00, I DON'T KNOW


[Captioner] 20:09:44
WHAT I'M DOING IN LIFE, RIGHT?


[Captioner] 20:09:47
WE DON'T HAVE TO DEAL


[Captioner] 20:09:48
WITH THESE THINGS, RIGHT?


[Captioner] 20:09:49
ANYWAY, THANK YOU FOR THE TIME.


[Captioner] 20:09:51
>> Ms. Gauthier: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:09:56
THE LAST SPEAKER IS GUYATRI
PENDIALA.


[Captioner] 20:10:04
>> HELLO.


[Captioner] 20:10:07
I AM TALKING ABOUT SB403 AND HOW


[Captioner] 20:10:08
IT MIGHT AFFECT ME IN THE
FUTURE.


[Captioner] 20:10:16
SO I REALLY THINK IT WILL AFFECT


[Captioner] 20:10:23
MY FUTURE IF NOBODY HELPS IT


[Captioner] 20:10:27
BECAUSE YOU KNOW, CHILDREN MIGHT


[Captioner] 20:10:29
BULLY ME BECAUSE OF MY CASTE.


[Captioner] 20:10:32
AND I DON'T WANT THAT TO HAPPEN


[Captioner] 20:10:36
TO ME AND OTHER BRAMANS.


[Captioner] 20:10:45
SO THAT'S WHY I AM GOING FOR


[Captioner] 20:10:49
PEACEFUL PROTEST, BECAUSE I


[Captioner] 20:10:55
DON'T WANT THIS SB403 TO AFFECT


[Captioner] 20:10:59
ME OR ANY OTHER KID, ANYONE
ACTUALLY.


[Captioner] 20:11:05
AND THIS MIGHT NOT TAKE VERY


[Captioner] 20:11:08
LONG, THOUGH I JUST WANT TO SAY


[Captioner] 20:11:16
THAT WE HAVE TO STOP SB403


[Captioner] 20:11:17
BECAUSE IT MIGHT AFFECT MANY


[Captioner] 20:11:21
PEOPLE IN THE FUTURE, AND I'M


[Captioner] 20:11:25
VERY WORRIED FOR EVERYONE.


[Captioner] 20:11:47
AND I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT I


[Captioner] 20:11:51
REALLY THINK ME AND MANY OTHER


[Captioner] 20:11:52
BRAMANS DO NOT LIKE SB403.


[Captioner] 20:11:55
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:11:58

[Captioner] 20:12:08
COUNCILMEMBERS FOR THE

[Captioner] 20:12:12
THANK YOU, EVERYONE.


[Captioner] 20:12:16
I'M HERE TO VOICE MY PROTEST


[Captioner] 20:12:18
AGAINST THE SB403 BILL.


[Captioner] 20:12:21
I'M ALSO HERE TO REQUEST THE


[Captioner] 20:12:25
CITY COUNCIL TO PLEASE PASS A


[Captioner] 20:12:29
RESOLUTION IN THE FREMONT CITY


[Captioner] 20:12:34
TO BAN HINDUPHOBIA, HINDUPHOBIC
PRACTICES.


[Captioner] 20:12:36
ONE EXAMPLE THAT WE JUST SAW IN


[Captioner] 20:12:38
THE LAST 30 MINUTES WAS THERE


[Captioner] 20:12:39
WAS A GENTLEMEN HERE, ONE OF THE


[Captioner] 20:12:40
GENTLEMEN WHO SPOKE, HE WAS


[Captioner] 20:12:41
TALKING ABOUT THE FACT THAT


[Captioner] 20:12:42
INDIAN PRESIDENT, THE PRESIDENT


[Captioner] 20:12:46
OF INDIA WAS NOT ALLOWED IN THE


[Captioner] 20:12:47
TEMPLE BECAUSE OF LOWER CASTE.


[Captioner] 20:12:50
IT IS VERY EASY TO PROVE FALSE


[Captioner] 20:12:52
INFORMATION JUST BY TALKING


[Captioner] 20:12:52
TO -- OF INDIA.


[Captioner] 20:12:56
THEY WOULD TELL WHETHER A


[Captioner] 20:12:58
PERSON WOULD BE ALLOWED INTO THE


[Captioner] 20:12:59
TEMPLE OR NOT BECAUSE OF CASTE,


[Captioner] 20:12:59
THAT'S A LIE.


[Captioner] 20:13:01
THAT EXACTLY SHOWS THE PROBLEM


[Captioner] 20:13:02
WITH THE HINDUPHOBIA.


[Captioner] 20:13:05
THE GENTLEMAN RIGHT HERE


[Captioner] 20:13:09
EXHIBITED THE HINDU PHOBIA IN A


[Captioner] 20:13:09
VERY -- WAY.


[Captioner] 20:13:12
SO PLEASE, THAT SHOULD TELL THE


[Captioner] 20:13:14
SITUATION AND I REQUEST AGAIN


[Captioner] 20:13:15
THE CITY OF FREMONT TO PASS A


[Captioner] 20:13:18
BILL THAT IS PREVENTING ANY


[Captioner] 20:13:20
HINDUPHOBIC ACTIVITIES.


[Captioner] 20:13:21
THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 20:13:41

CONSENT CALENDAR.


[Captioner] 20:18:04
I WAS GOING TO MAKE THE MOTION


[Captioner] 20:18:07
BUT I SECONDED INSTEAD.


[Captioner] 20:18:08
>> Ms. Gauthier: OKAY.


[Captioner] 20:18:11
>> Mayor Mei: COUNCILMEMBER
SALWAN?


[Captioner] 20:18:12
>> Councilmember Salwan: THANK


[Captioner] 20:18:13
YOU, MADAME MAYOR.


[Captioner] 20:18:15
JUST A QUICK 2-MINUTE HIGHLIGHT,


[Captioner] 20:18:16
IF YOU COULD JUST KIND OF FILL


[Captioner] 20:18:16
US IN.


[Captioner] 20:18:19
YOU KNOW, THE MAIN PURPOSE OF


[Captioner] 20:18:21
THIS AND HOW WE GOT HERE AND HOW


[Captioner] 20:18:23
THIS WILL HELP OUR CITY REDUCE


[Captioner] 20:18:23
OUR DEBT.


[Captioner] 20:18:27
FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE PUBLIC.


[Captioner] 20:18:29
>> Mr. Persselin: SURE, NO
PROBLEM.


[Captioner] 20:18:32
SO THE CITY HAS OUTSTANDING


[Captioner] 20:18:36
BONDS THAT WERE ISSUED TO


[Captioner] 20:18:39
REFINANCE BONDS THAT WERE ISSUED


[Captioner] 20:18:41
PREVIOUSLY, ULTIMATELY TO PAY


[Captioner] 20:18:44
FOR CAPITAL PROJECTS LIKE THE


[Captioner] 20:18:46
POLICE ADMINISTRATION CENTER AND


[Captioner] 20:18:46
THE MAIN LIBRARY.


[Captioner] 20:18:54
IN THE CURRENT YEAR, WE HAVE


[Captioner] 20:18:58
BOTH A REVENUE SURPLUS DUE TO


[Captioner] 20:18:59
UNBUDGETED REVENUES, AND WE ALSO


[Captioner] 20:19:02
ARE EXPERIENCING A HIGH LEVEL OF


[Captioner] 20:19:05
CITY-WIDE SAVINGS DUE PRIMARILY


[Captioner] 20:19:07
TO VACANCIES.


[Captioner] 20:19:10
AS A RESULT OF THAT, WE HAVE


[Captioner] 20:19:12
ONE-TIME MONEY SO NOT ONGOING


[Captioner] 20:19:16
REVENUE, BUT WE HAVE ONE-TIME


[Captioner] 20:19:19
MONEY THAT WE CAN USE TO PAY OFF


[Captioner] 20:19:21
A PORTION OF THE BONDS THAT WE


[Captioner] 20:19:22
HAVE OUTSTANDING.


[Captioner] 20:19:26
SO WE ACTUALLY HAVE TWO WHAT ARE


[Captioner] 20:19:27
CALLED SERIES OF BONDS


[Captioner] 20:19:28
OUTSTANDING CURRENTLY.


[Captioner] 20:19:29
WHAT WE'RE TALKING TONIGHT IS


[Captioner] 20:19:30
ONE OF THOSE.


[Captioner] 20:19:34
THIS IS A WAY OF TAKING THAT


[Captioner] 20:19:36
ONE-TIME MONEY AND TURNING IT


[Captioner] 20:19:38
INTO ONGOING SAVINGS.


[Captioner] 20:19:42
SO THOSE BONDS ARE OUTSTANDING


[Captioner] 20:19:46
UNTIL 2038, 15 MORE YEARS, AND


[Captioner] 20:19:49
WE'LL BE PAYING APPROXIMATELY


[Captioner] 20:19:51
$1.3 MILLION IN DEBT SERVICE


[Captioner] 20:19:54
EACH YEAR FOR THE NEXT 15 YEARS


[Captioner] 20:19:56
IF THE BONDS REMAIN
OUTSTANDING.


[Captioner] 20:19:59
WHAT WE'RE ABLE TO DO WITH OUR


[Captioner] 20:20:02
ONE-TIME MONEY IS TO PAY OFF


[Captioner] 20:20:07
THOSE BONDS, WHICH WILL SAVE US,


[Captioner] 20:20:08
THEN, $1.3 MILLION A YEAR FOR


[Captioner] 20:20:09
THE NEXT 15 YEARS THAT CAN BE


[Captioner] 20:20:12
USED TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO THE


[Captioner] 20:20:13
COMMUNITY.


[Captioner] 20:20:15
MOREOVER, BECAUSE WE'RE PAYING


[Captioner] 20:20:18
THE BONDS OFF EARLY, WE WON'T


[Captioner] 20:20:20
HAVE TO PAY INTEREST ON THE


[Captioner] 20:20:22
BONDS THAT WE WOULD IF THEY


[Captioner] 20:20:25
REMAINED OUTSTANDING, AND THAT


[Captioner] 20:20:27
INTEREST THAT WE WOULD BE SAVING


[Captioner] 20:20:29
OVERALL IS WORTH ABOUT


[Captioner] 20:20:31
$2.6 MILLION TO THE CITY.


[Captioner] 20:20:34
SO THOSE ARE DOLLARS THAT AGAIN


[Captioner] 20:20:35
CAN BE USED TO PROVIDE SERVICES


[Captioner] 20:20:36
TO THE COMMUNITY INSTEAD OF


[Captioner] 20:20:37
PAYING INTEREST ON BONDS.


[Captioner] 20:20:40
>> Councilmember Salwan: THANK
YOU.


[Captioner] 20:20:42
I'M READY TO MOVE THIS FORWARD


[Captioner] 20:20:43
AT THE RIGHT TIME.


[Captioner] 20:20:44
>> Ms. Gauthier: WE DO HAVE A


[Captioner] 20:20:46
SPEAKER CARD, MADAME MAYOR,


[Captioner] 20:20:47
KELLY ABREU.


[Captioner] 20:20:47
>> Mayor Mei: THANKS.


[Captioner] 20:20:49
I ALSO HAVE ONE MORE


[Captioner] 20:20:50
COUNCILMEMBER, I BELIEVE.


[Captioner] 20:20:51
COUNCILMEMBER COX?


[Captioner] 20:20:51
OKAY.


[Captioner] 20:20:54
LET'S WAIT UNTIL AFTER --
MR. ABREU?


[Captioner] 20:21:09
>> THIS FINANCE DEPARTMENT HAS


[Captioner] 20:21:11
BEEN STUNNINGLY DEFICIENT IN


[Captioner] 20:21:14
PRESENTING ANY KIND OF A COGENT


[Captioner] 20:21:17
ANALYSIS OF WHAT'S GOING ON WITH
FINANCES.


[Captioner] 20:21:19
FOR EXAMPLE, TODAY'S ITEM.


[Captioner] 20:21:20
WE'RE HEARING ABOUT HOW MANY


[Captioner] 20:21:22
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WE'RE
SAVING.


[Captioner] 20:21:24
THIS IS IRRELEVANT TO ANY KIND


[Captioner] 20:21:27
OF A PROPER FINANCIAL ANALYSIS.


[Captioner] 20:21:28
WHAT WE SHOULD BE TALKING ABOUT,


[Captioner] 20:21:31
FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOU WERE PAYING


[Captioner] 20:21:33
1% INTEREST ON YOUR BONDS, THEN


[Captioner] 20:21:34
I SUSPECT YOU SHOULDN'T BE


[Captioner] 20:21:34
PAYING THEM OFF.


[Captioner] 20:21:38
EVEN IF 1% INTEREST ADDS UP TO


[Captioner] 20:21:40
$1.3 MILLION A YEAR OR


[Captioner] 20:21:41
2.6 MILLION OR WHATEVER IT IS.


[Captioner] 20:21:43
IF YOU'RE PAYING SOME HIGH


[Captioner] 20:21:44
INTEREST RATE AND YOU WANT TO


[Captioner] 20:21:46
CUT OFF THOSE HIGH INTEREST


[Captioner] 20:21:47
PAYMENTS, THAT WOULD BE A REAL


[Captioner] 20:21:48
REASON TO PAY OFF THESE BONDS.


[Captioner] 20:21:49
WE DIDN'T HEAR ABOUT THAT
TODAY.


[Captioner] 20:21:53
BECAUSE WE'RE GETTING THESE KIND


[Captioner] 20:21:58
OF KINDERGARTEN IRRATIONAL


[Captioner] 20:22:00
FINANCIAL EXPLANATIONS.


[Captioner] 20:22:04
IN OTHER AREAS OF THE CITY


[Captioner] 20:22:06
FINANCE, IN THE COMPREHENSIVE


[Captioner] 20:22:08
ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT


[Captioner] 20:22:11
DISAGREES WITH OTHER FINANCIAL


[Captioner] 20:22:13
REPORTS, AND WHAT DOES THAT HAVE


[Captioner] 20:22:13
TO DO?


[Captioner] 20:22:17
THE FINANCE DEPARTMENT, YOUR


[Captioner] 20:22:18
FINANCE STAFF IS UNRESPONSIVE


[Captioner] 20:22:20
WHEN THEY GET, YOU KNOW, SERIOUS


[Captioner] 20:22:24
QUESTIONS ABOUT WHY ARE YOUR


[Captioner] 20:22:25
REPORTS DISAGREEING WITH ONE
ANOTHER?


[Captioner] 20:22:29
WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IS


[Captioner] 20:22:31
SLIDES, IS A RATIONAL ANALYSIS


[Captioner] 20:22:34
OF FINANCE DECISIONS AND A


[Captioner] 20:22:35
RATIONAL JUSTIFICATION FOR WHAT


[Captioner] 20:22:36
YOU'RE DOING.


[Captioner] 20:22:38
NOT WE'RE SAVING MILLIONS OF


[Captioner] 20:22:39
DOLLARS A YEAR, YOU KNOW, YOU


[Captioner] 20:22:42
CAN SAVE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS A


[Captioner] 20:22:44
YEAR BUT THAT HAS TO BE DONE ON


[Captioner] 20:22:49
AN INTEREST RATE BASIS, NOT ON A


[Captioner] 20:22:51
HOW MANY MILLIONS OF DOLLARS A


[Captioner] 20:22:51
YEAR YOU SAVE.


[Captioner] 20:22:53
THIS WHOLE EXPLANATION DOESN'T


[Captioner] 20:22:54
HOLD ANY WATER.


[Captioner] 20:22:56
THERE MIGHT BE AN EXPLANATION IN


[Captioner] 20:22:57
THERE BUT WE DIDN'T HEAR IT.


[Captioner] 20:22:57
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:23:01
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:23:03
AT THIS TIME, I'M GOING TO CLOSE

[Captioner] 20:23:56
PREPAYMENT.


[Captioner] 20:23:59

COUNCIL RETREAT.

KRISTINA BRIGGS IS AVAILABLE FOR
QUESTIONS.


[Captioner] 20:25:41

SEEING NONE, ARE THERE ANY


[Captioner] 20:25:48
COMMENTS FROM THE PUBLIC?


[Captioner] 20:25:55
DO WE HAVE ANY SPEAKER CARDS?


[Captioner] 20:25:56
>> Ms. Gauthier: WE HAVE A


[Captioner] 20:25:58
HAND RAISED IN ZOOM.


[Captioner] 20:25:58
LISA DANZ.


[Captioner] 20:26:01
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:26:02
>> GOOD EVENING AND THANK YOU


[Captioner] 20:26:03
FOR THE OPPORTUNITY.


[Captioner] 20:26:06
I TOOK A LOOK AT THIS ITEM AND


[Captioner] 20:26:08
OVER THE ANALYSIS OF SOME OF THE


[Captioner] 20:26:09
ACTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN TAKEN ON


[Captioner] 20:26:12
THE PREVIOUS PRIORITIES, AND I'M


[Captioner] 20:26:14
PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN THE


[Captioner] 20:26:15
HOMELESSNESS PRIORITY SO I WAS


[Captioner] 20:26:17
LOOKING CLOSELY AT THAT AND WHAT


[Captioner] 20:26:19
REALLY JUMPED OUT AT ME IS THERE


[Captioner] 20:26:20
IS A LONG LIST OF ACTIONS THAT


[Captioner] 20:26:23
HAVE BEEN TAKEN AND I DO WANT TO


[Captioner] 20:26:25
COMMEND AND APPRECIATE THE CITY


[Captioner] 20:26:26
FOR TAKING ALL OF THOSE ACTIONS


[Captioner] 20:26:27
BUT I FEEL LIKE IF WE REALLY


[Captioner] 20:26:28
WANT TO UNDERSTAND HOW WE'RE


[Captioner] 20:26:29
MAKING PROGRESS ON THE PRIORITY,


[Captioner] 20:26:31
THE QUESTIONS WE SHOULD BE


[Captioner] 20:26:32
ASKING SHOULD ALL FOCUS ON THE


[Captioner] 20:26:34
BOTTOM LINE OF WHAT'S THE IMPACT


[Captioner] 20:26:38
ON THE TOTAL BURDEN OF


[Captioner] 20:26:38
HOMELESSNESS ON THE CITY AND HOW


[Captioner] 20:26:39
MANY PEOPLE ARE EXPERIENCING
IT.


[Captioner] 20:26:41
AND I KNOW THAT WE ARE TRACKING


[Captioner] 20:26:42
THAT WITH THE POINT IN TIME


[Captioner] 20:26:45
COUNT AND THAT THOSE NUMBERS GOT


[Captioner] 20:26:46
WORSE FROM THE PREVIOUS POINT IN


[Captioner] 20:26:47
TIME COUNT TO THIS ONE.


[Captioner] 20:26:51
AND IT'S EASY TO SAY OH A LOT OF


[Captioner] 20:26:54
THAT WAS OUT OF THE CITY'S


[Captioner] 20:26:57
HANDS, BUT WE DO HAVE A ROLE TO


[Captioner] 20:26:58
PLAY AND OTHER JURISDICTIONS


[Captioner] 20:26:59
HAVE A ROLE TO PLAY.


[Captioner] 20:27:02
WHEN BUSINESSES ARE ANALYZING


[Captioner] 20:27:03
THEIR PERFORMANCE, THEY OFTEN


[Captioner] 20:27:06
USE SOMETHING LIKE -- WHERE YOU


[Captioner] 20:27:07
HAVE A TOP LINE GOAL OF WHAT


[Captioner] 20:27:09
YOU'RE REALLY TRYING TO


[Captioner] 20:27:11
ACCOMPLISH AND OTHER MEASURABLE


[Captioner] 20:27:11
GOALS TO GET YOU THERE.


[Captioner] 20:27:15
AND I WONDER IF -- MAYBE THIS


[Captioner] 20:27:17
EXISTS AND I'M NOT AWARE OF IT,


[Captioner] 20:27:18
BUT I FEEL LIKE THE REPORTS THAT


[Captioner] 20:27:22
I SAW DIDN'T REALLY SERVE THE


[Captioner] 20:27:24
PURPOSE OF SAYING HOW CLOSE ARE


[Captioner] 20:27:27
WE TO, YOU KNOW, STARTING TO


[Captioner] 20:27:28
DECREASE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE


[Captioner] 20:27:30
WHO ARE HAVING TO SLEEP ON THE


[Captioner] 20:27:31
STREETS EVERY DAY RATHER THAN


[Captioner] 20:27:32
THE CURRENT STATE OF INCREASE.


[Captioner] 20:27:32
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:27:35
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:27:37
ARE THERE ANY OTHER SPEAKERS ON


[Captioner] 20:27:37
THIS ITEM?


[Captioner] 20:27:41
SEEING NONE, I'M GOING TO CLOSE


[Captioner] 20:27:43
THE COMMENT PERIOD, PUBLIC


[Captioner] 20:27:44
COMMENT PERIOD ON ITEM 6B.


[Captioner] 20:27:46
AND I'LL TURN IT BACK TO THE


[Captioner] 20:27:47
COUNCIL FOR ANY COMMENTS.


[Captioner] 20:27:52
IS THERE ANY MOTION?


[Captioner] 20:27:56
I WANTED JUST TO NOTE THAT FROM


[Captioner] 20:27:59
THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE COUNCIL,


[Captioner] 20:28:01
I KNOW HOMELESSNESS -- WE KEPT


[Captioner] 20:28:03
OUR TOP THREE PRIORITIES AND


[Captioner] 20:28:05
THAT ACTUALLY WE ARE IN THE


[Captioner] 20:28:07
PROCESS OF HIRING SOMEONE TO


[Captioner] 20:28:08
SPECIFICALLY WORK WITH US ON THE


[Captioner] 20:28:11
PLAN FROM THE HUMAN SERVICES


[Captioner] 20:28:13
DEPARTMENT ON A MORE DETAILED


[Captioner] 20:28:14
ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY ON HOW


[Captioner] 20:28:15
WE'RE GOING TO BE ADDRESSING
THAT.


[Captioner] 20:28:18
SO I JUST WANTED TO NOTE FOR


[Captioner] 20:28:20
MS. DANZ OR JUST THE PUBLIC THAT


[Captioner] 20:28:21
OUR COUNCIL ABSOLUTELY CONSIDERS


[Captioner] 20:28:22
THAT ONE OF OUR TOP PRIORITIES.


[Captioner] 20:28:27
AND SO SEEING NO OTHER COMMENT


[Captioner] 20:28:29
FROM THE COUNCIL, CAN I GET A


[Captioner] 20:28:31
MOTION TO APPROVE THE REPORT


[Captioner] 20:28:32
FROM THE COUNCIL RETREAT?


[Captioner] 20:28:34

THIS MORNING.


[Captioner] 20:28:39

[Captioner] 20:28:40
THE GREEN SHEET, WHICH I KNOW


[Captioner] 20:28:41
WAS A --


[Captioner] 20:28:42

[Captioner] 20:28:43
MINOR CORRECTION.


[Captioner] 20:28:45
>> Mayor Mei: MINOR CORRECTION


[Captioner] 20:28:48

[Captioner] 20:29:49

[Captioner] 20:29:59
CHILDREN AND FAMILIES COME OUT


[Captioner] 20:29:59
TO THAT EVENT.


[Captioner] 20:30:02
I HOPE I'M RIGHT ON THE NUMBERS,


[Captioner] 20:30:03
BUT ROUGHLY, IT WAS VERY
CROWDED.


[Captioner] 20:30:06
I KNOW I SAW COUNCILMEMBER


[Captioner] 20:30:09
SALWAN AT THE EVENT, I THINK,


[Captioner] 20:30:10
AND I'M SURE SOME OTHERS MAY


[Captioner] 20:30:11
HAVE POPPED IN.


[Captioner] 20:30:13
AND THEN ALSO AS WE WERE MOVING


[Captioner] 20:30:15
IN SUPPORT OF OUR SMALL


[Captioner] 20:30:17
BUSINESSES, I WANTED TO THANK --


[Captioner] 20:30:18
I KNOW COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL, I


[Captioner] 20:30:21
RAN INTO YOU ALSO AT THE


[Captioner] 20:30:23
RE-OPENING OF THE NILES FARMERS
MARKET.


[Captioner] 20:30:27

[Captioner] 20:30:29
SERVING ON ALAMEDA COUNTY


[Captioner] 20:30:30
TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION, I DID


[Captioner] 20:30:34
MAKE A TRIP UP FOR ADVOCACY ON


[Captioner] 20:30:37
BEHALF OF THE CITY FOR THE


[Captioner] 20:30:38

[Captioner] 20:30:39
COMMISSION TO FOCUS ON A COUPLE


[Captioner] 20:30:41
KEY AREAS, AND I'M HAPPY TO


[Captioner] 20:30:43
SHARE THE REPORT IF YOU'D LIKE


[Captioner] 20:30:44
TO SEE WHAT ARE THE PRIORITIES.


[Captioner] 20:30:46
BUT FOR US, SOME OF THE THINGS


[Captioner] 20:30:48
WE FOCUSED ON WERE THE SAFE


[Captioner] 20:30:51
ROUTES TO SCHOOL, THE STUDENT


[Captioner] 20:30:52
PASSES, PARATRANSIT, THE


[Captioner] 20:30:54

[Captioner] 20:30:56
THE INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS,


[Captioner] 20:30:59

[Captioner] 20:31:10
FOR THE CONGRESSIONAL CITIES,


[Captioner] 20:31:13

[Captioner] 20:31:28
I KNOW IT'S A LITTLE CRAZY IN


[Captioner] 20:31:29
TERMS OF SCHEDULING BECAUSE IT'S


[Captioner] 20:31:31
RIGHT BEFORE TAX SEASON AND


[Captioner] 20:31:33
