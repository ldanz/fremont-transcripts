19:03:39 
I SEE TWO HANDS RAISED.
19:03:40 
I SEE CARL IM.
19:03:43  GORDINO AND BLAIR BEEKMAN.
19:03:46 
I'M NOT SURE IF THEY'RE FOR AGENDA 
19:03:46 ITEMS THIS EVENING.
19:03:48 
I JUST SEE BLAIR BEEKMAN.
19:03:51 
IS IT FOR AN AGENDA ITEM THIS EVENING?
19:03:52 
>> HI, BLAIR BEEKMAN HERE.
19:03:55 
I'D LIKE TO PULL CONSENT CALENDAR ITEM 
19:03:55 K.
19:03:58 
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY.
19:04:05 
ARE THERE ANY ITEMS -- I SEE OUR 
19:04:08 COUNCIL HAS A HAND RAISED.
19:04:10 
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, AN ITEM YOU 
19:04:10 WOULD LIKE TO PULL?
19:04:12 
>> Councilmember Kassan: YES, THANK 
19:04:12 YOU.
19:04:14 
I WOULD LIKE TO PULL ITEM O, AND I 
19:04:17 WOULD ALSO LIKE TO REGISTER A NO VOTE ON ITEM Q.
19:04:29 
>> Mayor Mei: ITEM Q AND THE OTHER ONE 
19:04:31 WAS ITEM -- MY APOLOGIES.
19:04:33 
>> Councilmember Kassan: I WOULD LIKE 
19:04:35 TO PULL ITEM O.
19:04:36 
>> Mayor Mei: OH, OKAY.
19:04:36 
THANK YOU.
19:04:52 
WE'LL ASK FOR THE CONSENT CALENDAR.
19:04:56 
I ALSO WANTED JUST TO ASK OUR CITY 
19:05:00 CLERK -- CITY ATTORNEY IF WE WANT TO CLARIFY.
19:05:02 
WE DID HAVE SOME QUESTIONS ORIGINALLY 
19:05:07 ON ITEM O, AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU SAW THE CLARIFICATION THAT CAME FROM THE 
19:05:11 COUNCIL OR IF THAT WAS IN ADDITION TO THAT CLARIFICATION THAT YOU HAVE A 
19:05:12 COMMENT ON THAT?
19:05:17 
SO OUR CITY ATTORNEY, DEBRA MARGOLIS, 
19:05:20 DO YOU WANT TO ADDRESS THAT REAL QUICKLY, BEFORE WE PULL THE ITEM, I 
19:05:22 JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE YOU SAW THE CLARIFICATION.
19:05:23 
>> Councilmember Kassan: NO, I TOTALLY 
19:05:25 UNDERSTAND THE ITEM AND I STILL WOULD LIKE TO PULL IT.
19:05:25 
THANK YOU.
19:05:26 
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY.
19:05:28 
I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE, BECAUSE WE 
19:05:32 HAD SOME QUESTIONS COME TO US SO WE HAD SENT OUT FOLLOW-UP CLARIFICATION.
19:05:36 
SO WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ITEMS O AND 
19:05:44 REGISTERING A NO VOTE ON Q, AND THEN THE OTHER ITEM WAS K, I BELIEVE.
19:05:52 
IF WE HAD A MOTION TO DO THOSE.
19:05:55 
>> Councilmember Jones: I MOVE THE 
19:05:55 REMAINDER.

19:06:33 
IS THAT CORRECT?
19:06:34 
>> Councilmember Kassan: NO, THAT 
19:06:35 WASN'T CORRECT.
19:06:36 
MS.
19:06:38  MARGOLIS THAT WAS BACKWARDS.
19:06:38 
>> Mayor Mei: SORRY.
19:06:42

19:06:58 COMMUNICATIONS, AND THESE ARE ITEMS THAT ARE NOT ON TONIGHT'S AGENDA.
19:06:59

19:11:03 
NEXT IS ANDREAS KADAVANICH.
19:11:04 
THANK YOU.
19:11:07 
>> GOOD EVENING.
19:11:10 
ANDREAS KADAVANICH WITH BIKE FREMONT.
19:11:14 
LAST WEEK THIS COUNCIL VOTED TO ONCE 
19:11:18 AGAIN DEFER THE TRAFFIC-CALMING PROJECT ON PASEO PADRE.
19:11:22 
IT WASN'T EXPLICIT IN THE  MOTION, BUT 
19:11:26 THERE IS AN EXPECTATION THAT THIS ITEM WILL COME BACK FOR COUNCIL FOR REVIEW 
19:11:29 AFTER STAFF HAS COME BACK WITH OPTIONS.
19:11:31 
WE AND THE PUBLIC LOOK FORWARD TO 
19:11:34 PARTICIPATING IN THAT DISCUSSION.
19:11:36 
THERE WERE A COUPLE OF ITEMS THAT GAVE 
19:11:40 ME CONCERN IN LISTENING TO THE DISCUSSION LAST WEEK BECAUSE THERE 
19:11:44 WERE CLEARLY SOME MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT HOW THIS PROJECT AND OTHER PROJECTS 
19:11:46 LIKE IT IN GENERAL WORK.
19:11:52 
ONE FALLACY WAS THE IDEA THAT 
19:11:57 ADDITIONAL LANES ADD CAPACITY TO A ROADWAY IN AN URBAN SETTING.
19:11:58 
THAT WORKS ON FREEWAYS, WHERE THERE 
19:12:02 ARE NO INTERSECTIONS, BUT IN AN URBAN SETTING, ONCE YOU HAVE ESTABLISHED 
19:12:42 INTERSECTIONS, THE TRAFFIC CAPACITY IS ESSENTIALLY SET BY THOSE.
19:12:47 
SO FIRST APPROXIMATION, THE NUMBER OF 
19:12:48 LANES NO LONGER  MATTERS.
19:12:50 
THAT'S A LITTLE OVERSIMPLIFICATION, IT 
19:12:52 GETS A LITTLE MORE COMPLICATED.
19:12:53 
THAT'S WHY WE HAVE TRAINED 
19:12:58 PROFESSIONALS, TRAINED TRANSPORTATION STAFF THAT DO THE ANALYSIS ON THESE 
19:12:59 AND FIGURE OUT WHAT'S REALLY GOING TO HAPPEN.
19:13:01 
THEY DON'T TYPICALLY POST THOSE 
19:13:04 ANALYSES ON NEXTDOOR.
19:13:07 
THAT SAID, I HAVE SPOKEN WITH MANY OF 
19:13:12 THESE ENGINEERS AND I GENERALLY HOLD THEM TO BE COMPETENT AT THEIR JOBS AND 
19:13:13 I THINK THEY UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY'RE DOING.
19:13:15 
SO I JUST WANT TO BE ABSOLUTELY CLEAR 
19:13:22 THAT THIS ENTIRE IDEA THAT WE NEED FOUR LANES ON PASEO PADRE FOR ROAD CAPACITY 
19:13:26 IS JUST PLAIN OUT WRONG, AND IT WAS ACTUALLY STATED SO IN THE STAFF REPORT.
19:13:30 
THE OTHER THING THAT WAS MENTIONED IS, 
19:13:34 WHICH AGAIN IS NOT QUITE RIGHT, IS IT WAS KIND OF FRAMED AS A TRADEOFF 
19:13:38 BETWEEN MOVING CARS AND ASSURING PEDESTRIAN SAFETY.
19:13:42 
IT'S NOT JUST PEDESTRIAN SAFETY.
19:13:44 
IF YOU LOOK AT FATALITY RATES ON 
19:13:49 FREMONT'S ROADS, THE BIGGEST IMPACT OF VISION ZERO HAS BEEN IN REDUCING 
19:13:51 MOTORIST DEATHS, NOT PEDESTRIAN DEATHS.
19:13:53 
AND THAT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE BECAUSE 
19:13:57 WE'VE BEEN GOING AFTER THE FASTER STREET AND WE'VE BEEN REDUCING THE 
19:14:03  SPEEDS FROM LIKE THE HIGH 45s TO LIKE 35, WHICH IS STILL LETHAL TO 
19:14:06 PEDESTRIANS BUT IT ACTUALLY SAVES A LOT OF MOTORISTS' LIVES.
19:14:07 
SO IF YOU ACTUALLY LOOK AT PASEO 
19:14:09 PADRE, IT'S KIND OF THE SAME SITUATION.
19:14:11 
MOST OF THE SEVERE INJURIES ON THAT 
19:14:13 CORRIDOR ARE DRIVERS.
19:14:15 
IT'S NOT PEDESTRIANS OR ANYBODY ELSE.
19:14:16 
IT'S DRIVERS.
19:14:18 
AND AGAIN, THE IDEA IS 
19:14:22 TRAFFIC-CALMING, VISION ZERO, IT'S ABOUT ENSURING THE SAFETY OF EVERYBODY.
19:14:27 
AND AGAIN, IF YOU CHOOSE TO PUT THAT 
19:14:31 BALANCE OF ROAD SPEEDS AND TRAVEL SPEEDS AND SAFETY ON ONE SIDE, YOU'RE 
19:14:32 FREE TO DO SO AS THE COUNCIL.
19:14:35 
BUT WE DO EXPECT THAT YOU EXPLAIN YOURSELF.
19:14:36 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
19:14:40 
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU,  ANDREAS.
19:14:45 
NEXT SPEAKER IS BLAIR BEEKMAN.
19:14:47 
>> HI.
19:14:48 
THANK YOU.
19:14:53 
WE ARE AT A TIME OF LOCAL COMMUNITIES 
19:14:59 ACROSS THE COUNTRY WORKING WITH EQUITY REIMAGINE AND LOVE LIFE THAT CAN BEGIN 
19:15:03 TO WORK TOWARDS A MORE OPEN, POSITIVE SUSTAINABLE FUTURE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL.
19:15:05 
I FEEL THE IDEAS OF EQUITY AND 
19:15:08 REIMAGINE CAN WORK AS AN INTERESTING INCENTIVE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AT THIS 
19:15:09 TIME.
19:15:14 
IT BETTERS OUR BETTER HUMAN THINKING 
19:15:16 AND IDEALS AND PROVIDES HOPE.
19:15:18 
IT CAN BETTER HELP INVITE PEOPLE TO 
19:15:21 THE COMMUNITY PROCESS WHO HAVE GROWN TIRED, DEPRESSED, APATHETIC, COLD AND 
19:15:26 POSSIBLY VIOLENT OF OUR OWN CURRENT SYSTEM, A SYSTEM THAT IS OFTEN RELYING 
19:15:30 ON STATE VIOLENCE AND EXTREMISM TO SOLVE OUR LONG TERM SOCIAL PLANNING 
19:15:32 ISSUES AND  NEEDS.
19:15:34 
THIS COUNTRY HAS STARTED A BAD TREND 
19:15:38 OVER THE PAST 20 YEARS AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL, WITH ITS OWN ROLE IN THE EVENTS 
19:15:41 OF 9/11 AND ITS FOLLOWING RESPONSE.
19:15:44 
EQUITY REIMAGINE AND IN FACT OPEN 
19:15:50 PUBLIC POLICY IDEAS WITH TECHNOLOGY ARE GOOD HUMAN  IDEALS, PURPOSES AND 
19:15:54 INTENTIONS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL THAT COLLECTIVELY AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY, 
19:16:00 WE CAN BEGIN TO BETTER ASK THE HEALING QUESTIONS OF OUR NATIONAL, 
19:16:03 INTERNATIONAL GOVERNMENTS AND GOVERNMENT AGENCIES LIKE THE U.N.
19:16:05 
AND IN TERMS THAT CAN DEVELOP IDEAS OF 
19:16:10 PEACE AND OPEN DEMOCRACY, NOT MORE WAR, VIOLENCE AND EXTREMISM TO SOLVE OUR 
19:16:12 LONG-TERM SOCIAL ISSUES.
19:16:15 
THANK YOU.
19:16:18 
I THINK IT'S PRETTY APPARENT AT THIS 
19:16:21 TIME THAT OVER THE PAST COUPLE YEARS, WE'VE ACTUALLY SPENT A LOT MORE MONEY 
19:16:28 ON POLICE INFRASTRUCTURE, POLICE RAISES IN THEIR CONTRACTS.
19:16:31 
THEY HAVE HAD PRETTY GOOD RIGHT NOW, 
19:16:36 AND FOR ALL THE WORRY ABOUT REIMAGINE AND EQUITY, YOU KNOW, AND THE 
19:16:41 INCIDENCE OF GEORGE FLOYD, WE CONTINUE TO FUND THE POLICE, AND WE'VE DONE OUR 
19:16:43 DUE DILIGENCE IN THAT AREA.
19:16:45 
I THINK WE ARE NOW AT A TIME WE CAN 
19:16:50 REALLY CONSIDER WHAT ARE OUR IDEAS OF EQUITY AND REIMAGINE TO SOLVE OUR 
19:16:51 ISSUES.
19:16:53 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR CONSENT 
19:16:54 CALENDAR TONIGHT.
19:16:56 
IT HAS A LOT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN 
19:16:59 SERVICES IDEAS ON IT AND  EFFORTS.
19:17:04 
YEAH, I MEAN, A COMMUNITY HAS MANY 
19:17:09 ISSUES TO DEAL WITH, AND I HOPE WE'RE AT A TIME THAT WE FILLED OUR RESERVE 
19:17:17 TANKS OF POLICE INFRASTRUCTURE FUNDING AND RAISES, AND I HOPE WE'RE AT A TIME 
19:17:21 TO REALLY PUT OUR BEST FOOT FORWARD OF OUR BETTER  IDEALS AND OUR BETTER 
19:17:22 PERSONS.
19:17:26 
AND THAT INCLUDES LESS POLICING AND 
19:17:31 MORE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES IDEAS, AND THE SAME WITH -- TO MENTION 
19:17:32 RENEWABLE ENERGY IDEAS.
19:17:33 
LET'S WORK ON THOSE THINGS.
19:17:36 
WE DON'T HAVE TO GO BACKWARDS AND 
19:17:43 FORCE OURSELVES INTO BAD DIRTY FOSSIL FUEL PRACTICES AT THIS TIME, WE REALLY 
19:17:46 ASK HOW WE CAN GO FORWARD WITH OUR GOOD RENEWABLES.
19:17:47 
THANK YOU.
19:17:48 
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
19:18:00 
THE NEXT SPEAKER IS ALVIN  SOJOURNER.
19:18:02 
>> I'M WITH A COMPANY CALLED WHITE 
19:18:03 HOUSE WORLDWIDE SOLUTIONS.
19:18:06 
WE'RE LOCATED ON KATO ROAD, AND THIS 
19:18:10 YEAR WE'VE HAD FOR MORE THAN THREE YEARS IS ON THE FREEWAY SIDE AND IT 
19:18:17 USED TO BE ON THE STREETS ALSO TO WHERE WE HAD MANY PARKED TRUCKS AND 
19:18:17 EVERYTHING.
19:18:21 
NOW IT'S ON THE FREEWAY SIDE TO WHERE 
19:18:23 WE HAVE PEOPLE CAMPED OUT, 24/7.
19:18:29 
VERY UNSIGHTLY, VERY UNSAFE, AND THERE 
19:18:35 WAS A SOLUTION IN PLACE TO WHERE THERE WERE BOULDERS BEING PLACED ON THAT 
19:18:42 SIDE WHERE PEOPLE WERE PARKING THERE IN FRONT OF SEAGATE AND TESLA AND SOME OF 
19:18:44 THE OTHER BUILDINGS GOING DOWN THE STREET, THAT HAPPENED.
19:18:47 
THE PROJECT STOPPED.
19:18:53 
NOW THERE IS SOME OTHER PROPOSED 
19:18:54 SOLUTION WHICH IS NOT A  SOLUTION.
19:18:56 
WE HAD A SOLUTION IN PLACE THAT WORKED.
19:18:59 
AND WE SHOULD CONTINUE WITH  THAT.
19:19:04 
SUPPOSEDLY IN THE LAST -- ONE OF THE 
19:19:09 PAST RECENT MEETINGS, IT GOT VOTED DOWN AND GOT DELAYED.
19:19:14 
THERE WAS NO CONSULTATION OF THE 
19:19:16 PEOPLE THAT ACTUALLY HAVE BUSINESSES THERE.
19:19:22 
SO I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT CHANGE.
19:19:25 
WE AS A BUSINESS WOULD LIKE -- WE 
19:19:34  WOULD LIKE TO PARTICIPATE, BUT IT IS VERY, VERY UNSAFE.
19:19:36 
WE HAVE TRUCKS, WE HAVE  VEHICLES, WE 
19:19:37 HAVE PROPERTY DAMAGE, WE'VE HAD ALL OF THAT.
19:19:40 
WE'VE HAD PEOPLE SIT ON OUR PROPERTY 
19:19:43 AND ACTUALLY SMOKING CRACK AND WHATEVER.
19:19:45 
SO WE NEED TO ELIMINATE THE ISSUE.
19:19:48 
WE CAN'T JUST BE, YOU KNOW, COMPLIANT 
19:19:50 AND ALLOW TO HAPPEN.
19:19:52 
THANK YOU.
19:19:56 
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
19:20:01 
THAT WAS THE LAST OF OUR PUBLIC 
19:20:05 COMMENTS THIS EVENING.
19:20:07 
AT THIS TIME, I WILL TURN IT BACK TO 
19:20:10 AGENDA ITEMS THAT WERE PULLED FROM THE CONSENT  CALENDAR.
19:20:12 
>> Councilmember Kassan: I'M SORRY, 
19:20:13 CAN I JUST SAY SOMETHING REALLY QUICK?
19:20:14 
I JUST THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT 
19:20:18 THAT WE ANNOUNCE THAT EVEN THOUGH IT WAS SAID AT THE LAST MEETING THAT THE 
19:20:24 ITEM RELATED TO PASEO PADRE AND THE ROAD DIET WOULD BE COMING BACK TO 
19:20:27 COUNCIL, I JUST THINK EVERYONE SHOULD KNOW FROM THE PUBLIC THAT THAT WAS 
19:20:32 DECIDED -- THE STAFF DECIDED NOT TO BRING IT BACK TO COUNCIL AND THAT  
19:20:36  INSTEAD, THEY WOULD HAVE THE CONSTRUCTION BE -- KEEP THE TWO LANES 
19:20:38 IN BOTH DIRECTIONS AND ADD A BASIC BIKE LANE.
19:20:40 
I JUST THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT 
19:20:42 THAT PEOPLE KNOW THAT SINCE THAT WASN'T WHAT WAS SAID AT THE LAST MEETING.
19:20:43 
THANK YOU.
19:20:51 
>> Ms.
19:20:51  Shackelford: MAYOR MEI?
19:20:54 
>> Mayor Mei: YES, DEPUTY CITY MANAGER.
19:20:54 
>> Ms.
19:20:57  Shackelford: I'D LIKE TO MAKE A CLARIFYING STATEMENT.
19:20:59 
>> Mayor Mei: YES.
19:21:02 
>> Ms.
19:21:04  Shackelford: IS IT OKAY FOR ME TO COMMENT ON THAT PARTICULAR ITEM?
19:21:09 
MS.
19:21:11  MARGOLIS THE ITEM IS NOT ON THE AGENDA.
19:21:14 
IF YOU'RE GOING TO SPEAK TO IT VERY 
19:21:19 BRIEFLY JUST TO COMMENT ON WHEN IT IS GOING TO BE ON THE AGENDA OR --

19:21:22 >> Mayor Mei:  -- MS.
19:21:23  MARGOLIS THAT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE, BRIEFLY.
19:21:24 
>> Ms.
19:21:25  Shackelford: OKAY.
19:21:27 
SO THE DIRECTION THAT WE RECEIVED FROM 
19:21:30 THE COUNCIL LAST WEEK ON THAT PARTICULAR ITEM WAS TO DO MORE 
19:21:36 COMMUNITY OUTREACH, PARTICULARLY ONCE THE TRAFFIC CONDITIONS RETURN TO, I 
19:21:41 GUESS WHAT I'LL REFER TO AS A NEW NORMAL WITH PEOPLE RETURNING TO WORK 
19:21:42 AND DRIVING MORE.
19:21:47 
THAT WILL HAPPEN/OCCUR OUTSIDE OF THE 
19:21:52 CONSTRUCTION PERIOD, SO FOR NOW AND IN ORDER TO STAY WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE 
19:21:57 RFP, WE WILL NARROW THE LANES AND WE WILL ADD A BIKE LANE AS AN INTERIM 
19:22:03 MEASURE, BUT THE ITEM WILL BE BACK BEFORE THE COUNCIL SOMETIME IN 
19:22:08 SEPTEMBER OR -- SOMETIME IN THE FALL.
19:22:11 
>> Mayor Mei: SO JUST TO CLARIFY 
19:22:12 AGAIN, YOU SAID YOU WILL BE ADDING A LANE?
19:22:14 
SO YOU WILL BE NARROWING IT DOWN TO 
19:22:15 ONE LANE?
19:22:16 
>> Ms.
19:22:20  Shackelford: NO, WE WILL NARROW THE EXISTING LANES AND MAKE ROOM FOR A 
19:22:21 BIKE LANE.
19:22:23 
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY.
19:22:23 
>> Ms.
19:22:27  Shackelford: IT JUST WON'T BE THE LARGER, WIDER BUFFERED BIKE LANE.
19:22:27 
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY.
19:22:29 
THANK YOU.
19:22:31 
>> City Manager Danaj: I THINK THIS 
19:22:36 STAFF ALSO JUST SENT INFORMATION IN AN EMAIL TO THE CITY COUNCIL.
19:22:36 
>> Mayor Mei: RIGHT.
19:22:38 
AND IF WE CAN, AT THE REQUEST OF 
19:22:42 KEEPING PUBLIC AWARENESS AND TRANSPARENCY, IF WE COULD POST THAT 
19:22:45 JUST TO MAKE SURE EVERYONE IS IN THE SAME PAGE ON THAT INFORMATION.
19:22:48 
>> City Manager Danaj: YES, WE CAN DO 
19:22:48 THAT.
19:22:49 
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
19:22:54 
AND SO NOW I'LL RETURN BACK TO THE 
19:22:56 ITEMS THAT WERE PULLED FROM THE CONSENT CALENDAR.
19:23:04 
AND I BELIEVE THAT WAS ITEM K FIRST, 
19:23:07 AND THEN ALSO ITEM Q -- OR K AND O.
19:23:12 
K IS BLAIR BEEKMAN.
19:23:13 
WOULD YOU LIKE TO SPEAK ON THAT?
19:23:14 
THANK YOU.
19:23:16 
>> Councilmember Salwan: MADAME MAYOR?
19:23:19 
I WANT TO RECUSE ON THIS ITEM SINCE MY 
19:23:25 BUSINESS IS ON FREMONT BOULEVARD, SO JUST OUT OF AN ABUNDANCE OF CAUTION.
19:23:26 
>> Mayor Mei: YES, THANK YOU.
19:23:27 
DULY NOTED.
19:23:29 
SO COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN WILL BE 
19:23:33 RECUSING HIMSELF FROM THIS ITEM DUE TO THE PROXIMITY OF HIS BUSINESS.
19:23:33 
MR.
19:23:35  BEEKMAN, IF YOU'D LIKE TO SPEAK.
19:23:36 
THANK YOU.
19:23:39 
>> HI.
19:23:40 
BLAIR BEEKMAN HERE.
19:23:42 
I GUESS FIRST A THANK YOU TO 
19:23:49 COUNCILPERSON KASSAN FOR HER WORK ON THE BIKE LANE ISSUE ON PASEO PADRE.
19:23:50 
AND THANK YOU FOR THE CLARIFICATION 
19:23:52 FROM EVERYONE.
19:23:54 
IT HELPED.
19:23:54 
THANK YOU.
19:23:59 
YEAH.
19:24:02 
FOR, YOU KNOW, THE ISSUES OF FREMONT 
19:24:09 BOULEVARD, YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE A HISTORY DEVELOPING OF WHAT YOU WANT TO DO WITH 
19:24:15 THE FREMONT BOULEVARD AREA AND TRAFFIC MODIFICATION -- TRAFFIC SIGNAL ISSUES.
19:24:17 
THE TRAFFIC SIGNAL ISSUES IS JUST ONE 
19:24:25 COMPONENT OF A LARGE PLAN, AND I CAN'T STRESS ENOUGH THE IMPORTANCE OF OPEN 
19:24:31 PUBLIC POLICIES THAT NEED TO GO ALONG WITH ALL THE NEW TECHNOLOGY IDEAS THAT 
19:24:38 YOU'RE CONSIDERING FOR THE FUTURE OF FREMONT AND ITS TRAFFIC LANES AND 
19:24:42 STREETS, AND FREMONT BOULEVARD IS JUST THE CROWN JEWEL OF HOW YOU'RE GOING TO 
19:24:43 WORK ON ISSUES IN THE FUTURE.
19:24:48 
SO GOOD LUCK HOW YOU DO THAT.
19:24:50 
I HOPE IT CAN BE OPEN PUBLIC POLICIES 
19:24:57 THAT IS JUST AS IMPORTANT AS WHATEVER TECHNOLOGY THAT YOU'RE GOING TO ASK 
19:24:59 FOR.
19:25:05 
AND I KNOW, FOR INSTANCE, IN SIMPLE 
19:25:11 TERMS, THE TRAFFIC MODIFICATION SIGNALS AT EACH TRAFFIC LIGHT, THEY CAN 
19:25:18 MONITOR THE FLOW OF TRAFFIC AND HOW TO TIME THE STOPLIGHTS BASICALLY.
19:25:20 
IN SAN JOSÉ, IN THE SANTA CLARA 
19:25:26 VALLEY, SANTA CLARA COUNTY, IT'S USED TO REALLY -- THEY'VE DEVELOPED A 
19:25:34 REALLY, REALLY GOOD SYSTEM ABOUT ITS USE FOR THE VT A AND HOW TO TIME THE 
19:25:38 LIGHTS FOR THE BUSES, THEY GET A REALLY SMOOTH TRIP AND DON'T HAVE TO WAIT AT 
19:25:38 MANY STOPLIGHTS.
19:25:42 
I IMAGINE YOU'LL WORK ON THAT STEP FOR 
19:25:42 FREMONT.
19:25:50 
AND I JUST -- EXCUSE ME.
19:25:51 
SORRY ABOUT THAT.
19:25:53 
I'VE BEEN DOING THIS WORK FOR FOUR OR 
19:25:57 FIVE YEARS NOW AND IT'S AN IMPORTANT POINT TO ME THAT THOSE LITTLE TRAFFIC 
19:26:04 MONITORS THAT ARE ON THE TRAFFIC SIGNALS, YOU KNOW, THEY HAVE A WEALTH 
19:26:12 OF INFORMATION, AND THEY STORE A LOT OF DATA, THEY COLLECT A LOT OF DATA ON 
19:26:14 THINGS AND THEY HAVE A LITTLE VIDEO CAMERA.
19:26:16 
YOU KNOW, THE FUTURE OF THOSE THINGS 
19:26:21 IS REALLY IMPORTANT, AND I WISH WE COULD TALK ABOUT THAT MORE AND MAKE 
19:26:25 THAT MORE OF A REGULAR PART OF OUR OPEN DIALOGUE ABOUT, YOU KNOW, FOR ALL THE 
19:26:32 ALPR STUFF WE TALK  ABOUT, AND CAMERA -- SPEED CAMERAS AND ALL THAT STUFF.
19:26:34 
I HOPE WE CAN MAKE OPEN PUBLIC 
19:26:39 POLICIES A GOOD FEATURE OF THOSE LITTLE DEVICES, THAT THEY HAVE A LOT OF DATA 
19:26:43 TECH THAT THEY CAN COLLECT, AND TO LEARN HOW TO TALK ABOUT WHAT IT CAN DO 
19:26:49 AND JUST TO MAKE IT A MORE EVERYDAY PART OF OUR PROCESS, JUST FAMILIAR AND 
19:26:51 RESPECTABLE, I HOPE WE CAN LEARN TO DO THOSE SORT OF THINGS.
19:26:52 
THANK YOU.
19:26:55 
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
19:27:00 
SO WE WANT TO TAKE THESE ITEMS 
19:27:04  SEPARATELY --
>> Mr.
19:27:06  Quintanilla: WE HAVE ONE ADDITIONAL PUBLIC COMMENTER.
19:27:07 
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY.
19:27:09 
LINDA DULANEY.
19:27:10 
IS THIS ON ITEM K?
19:27:14 
HELLO?
19:27:17 
>> I DID NOT RAISE MY HAND.
19:27:18 
SORRY.
19:27:20 
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY.
19:27:20 
THANK YOU.
19:27:25 
CAN WE PLEASE GET A MOTION ON ITEM K, 
19:27:29 UNLESS THERE'S ANY COMMENTS FROM OUR COUNCIL?
19:27:32 
MOTION BY COUNCILMEMBER JONES.
19:27:36 
SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER  KASSAN.
19:27:43 
PLEASE ROLL CALL VOTE ON ITEM K.
19:27:44 
>> Mr.
19:27:45  Quintanilla:COUNCILMEMBE R COX, AYE.
19:27:48 
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN --

19:27:49 >> Mayor Mei: HE'S RECUSED HIMSELF.
19:27:50 
>> Mr.
19:27:51  Quintanilla: RECUSED.
19:27:53 
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, AYE.
19:27:55 
COUNCILMEMBER JONES, AYE.
19:27:58 
COUNCILMEMBER KENG, AYE.
19:28:01 
VICE MAYOR SHAO, AYE.
19:28:03 
MAYOR MEI, AYE.
19:28:05 
>> Mayor Mei: THE MOTION PASSES 
19:28:09 UNANIMOUSLY WITH COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN RECUSING HIMSELF FROM THIS ITEM.
19:28:17 
NEXT IS THE ITEM -- I THINK IT'S ITEM 
19:28:22 -- JUST TO CLARIFY AGAIN, I APOLOGIZE, IT'S ITEM --

19:28:22 >> City Manager Danaj: O.
19:28:24 
>> Mayor Mei:  -- O, WHICH IS THE 
19:28:32 TERMINATION OF THE COVID-19 LOCAL EMERGENCY AND RESCISSION OF THE CITY'S 
19:28:33 RESIDENTIAL EVICTION ORDER.
19:28:35 
I WOULD LIKE THE CITY ATTORNEY JUST TO 
19:28:38 MAKE THE COMMENTS THAT WERE SHARED EARLIER IN THE CLARIFICATION FOR THIS 
19:28:41 ITEM, AND THEN ALSO I KNOW COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN WANTED TO SPEAK 
19:28:42 ON THIS.
19:28:43 
CITY ATTORNEY, PLEASE?
19:28:44 
MS.
19:28:44  MARGOLIS SURE.
19:28:49 
THE TITLE OF THIS ITEM INDICATED THAT 
19:28:51 THE LOCAL EMERGENCY WAS BEING TERMINATED.
19:28:54 
BUT THAT'S NOT EXACTLY ACCURATE.
19:28:57 
WHAT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENING TONIGHT IS 
19:29:02 THE LOCAL EMERGENCY IS NOT BEING TERMINATED, BUT IT'S BEING REVISED SO 
19:29:07 THAT THE TERMINATION DATE WILL BE CONSISTENT WITH THE DATE OF THE 
19:29:10 TERMINATION OF THE ALAMEDA COUNTY'S LOCAL EMERGENCY.
19:29:12 
AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS TO JUST 
19:29:17 STREAMLINE THE PROCESS A LITTLE BIT AS WE TRANSITION INTO GOING BACK TO 
19:29:23 SOMEWHAT NORMAL AFTER COVID AND REDUCING THE NUMBER OF ORDERS THAT ARE 
19:29:23 IN PLACE.
19:29:25 
SO THE LOCAL EMERGENCY STAYS IN EFFECT 
19:29:29 AS DO ALL THE OTHER REGULATIONS THAT ARE TIED TO THAT.
19:29:31 
THE ITEM THAT IS BEING TERMINATED IS 
19:29:33 THE RESIDENTIAL EVICTION MORATORIUM.
19:29:37 
WE ARE RESCINDING OUR LOCAL ORDER WITH 
19:29:42 RESPECT TO THAT, AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS THAT THE CITY'S LOCAL 
19:29:47 RESIDENTIAL EVICTION MORATORIUM IS SUPERSEDED BY THE COUNTY'S REGULATION.
19:29:49 
THE COUNTY'S REGULATION SPECIFICALLY 
19:29:54 SAID THAT IT TAKES PRECEDENCE OVER ANY CITY REGULATION, AND SO NO CITY 
19:29:58 REGULATION IS NEEDED IN ORDER FOR THAT PROTECTION TO CONTINUE TO BE OFFERED 
19:29:59 TO FREMONT RESIDENTS.
19:30:02 
THAT WILL REMAIN IN EFFECT UNTIL THE 
19:30:05 COUNTY TERMINATES THEIR EMERGENCY.
19:30:08 
AND JUST WANT TO MENTION THAT THE 
19:30:12 COMMERCIAL EVICTION MORATORIUM IS NOT AFFECTED BY TONIGHT'S ACTION AT ALL.
19:30:13 
IT REMAINS IN EFFECT, AND IT WILL 
19:30:19 CONTINUE TO REMAIN IN EFFECT FOR AS LONG AS THE CITY'S LOCAL EMERGENCY 
19:30:23 REMAINS IN EFFECT, WHICH IS TIED TO THE DATE THAT THE COUNTY'S EMERGENCY 
19:30:24 REMAINS IN EFFECT.
19:30:26 
SO IT'S A LITTLE BIT  COMPLICATED, BUT 
19:30:30 JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY FOR COUNCIL AND THE PUBLIC THAT THE PROTECTIONS UNDER 
19:30:34 BOTH THE RESIDENTIAL EVICTION MORATORIUM AND THE COMMERCIAL EVICTION 
19:30:37 MORATORIUM REMAIN IN PLACE AND IN FULL FORCE.
19:30:40 
>> City Manager Danaj: MAYOR AND 
19:30:43 MEMBERS THE COUNCIL AND FOR THE INFORMATION OF THE PUBLIC, WE ALSO 
19:30:47 STILL ALWAYS RETAIN THE ABILITY AND THE AUTHORITY TO DECLARE LOCAL EMERGENCIES 
19:30:52 AS SEEN FIT, AND TO DO SO IN A VERY TIMELY FASHION AS WE LED THE WAY IN 
19:30:53 THE BAY AREA AT THE BEGINNING OF COVID.
19:30:55 
SO I JUST WANT TO REMIND  EVERYONE 
19:30:58 THAT THOSE AUTHORITIES STILL ARE PROVIDED TO US.
19:31:01 
OUR AUTHORITY.
19:31:01 
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
19:31:05 
AND THIS ITEM WAS PULLED BY 
19:31:07 COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, IF YOU WANT TO SHARE YOUR COMMENTS AT THIS TIME.
19:31:09 
I SEE WE ALSO HAVE SOME PUBLIC 
19:31:09 SPEAKERS.
19:31:10 
>> Councilmember Kassan: YES, THANK 
19:31:10 YOU.
19:31:13 
YEAH, SO WHEN I SAW THIS ITEM, I DID 
19:31:16 FEEL LIKE IT DID MERIT SOME DISCUSSION AND SHOULDN'T BE ON THE CONSENT 
19:31:18 CALENDAR.
19:31:22 
JUST BECAUSE IT'S TWO SEPARATE 
19:31:28 RESOLUTIONS AND BOTH OF THEM  DO -- EVEN THOUGH CURRENTLY IF WE -- YOU 
19:31:33 KNOW, IT HAS NO IMMEDIATE EFFECT BECAUSE THE COUNTY CURRENTLY HAS -- 
19:31:37 CONTINUES TO HAVE A STATE OF -- OR WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE A STATE OF EMERGENCY 
19:31:42 FOR SOME TIME, SO WE WILL CONTINUE TO UNTIL THEY STOP IT AND THEN ALSO THEY 
19:31:47 DO HAVE EVICTION PROTECTIONS, BUT WE HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO CONTROL OVER WHAT 
19:31:53 THE COUNTY DOES, SO I'M JUST NOT SURE WHY WE WOULD BE SO QUICK TO CEDE ALL 
19:31:58 OF OUR CONTROL OVER TO THE COUNTY ON THESE ITEMS.
19:32:01 
I DON'T SEE ANY URGENCY IN DOING THAT, 
19:32:07 AND I'M JUST CONCERNED BECAUSE THERE WERE -- YOU KNOW, OBVIOUSLY CASE RATES 
19:32:12 AND HOSPITALIZATION RATES ARE  RISING, HOMELESSNESS IS STILL A BIG PROBLEM.
19:32:14 
I JUST -- YOU KNOW, I DON'T UNDERSTAND 
19:32:19 THE URGENCY TO JUST SAY, OKAY, WE'RE GOING TO JUST LEAVE IT ALL UP TO THE 
19:32:20 COUNTY NOW.
19:32:22 
ALSO, THERE WERE CERTAIN THINGS DONE 
19:32:26 UNDER OUR EMERGENCY -- OUR STATE OF EMERGENCY.
19:32:28 
ONE EXAMPLE THAT COMES TO MIND IS THE 
19:32:34 FACT THAT WE ARE REGULATING THE FEES THAT CAN BE CHARGED FOR DELIVERY APPS.
19:32:37 
I DON'T KNOW HONESTLY ALL THE THINGS 
19:32:42 THAT HAVE BEEN DONE UNDER THE STATE OF EMERGENCY BEFORE I AGREE TO PUT THE -- 
19:32:46 TO SAY OUR STATE OF EMERGENCY WILL TERMINATE WHENEVER THE COUNTY DECIDES 
19:32:49 TO TERMINATE ITS STATE OF EMERGENCY, I WOULD LIKE TO SEE A LIST OF EVERYTHING 
19:32:51 THAT WILL THEN GO AWAY AT THAT  MOMENT.
19:32:54 
I DON'T KNOW IF WE'RE GOING TO BE 
19:32:57 READY, IF THE COUNTY DECIDES TO TERMINATE THE STATE OF EMERGENCY 
19:33:00 TOMORROW, I DON'T KNOW IF WE'RE GOING TO BE READY TO GIVE UP ON ALL OF THOSE 
19:33:05 THINGS, INCLUDING, AS ONE EXAMPLE, THAT LIMITATION ON WHAT THE DELIVERY APPS 
19:33:06 CAN CHARGE.
19:33:09 
SO I JUST -- I DON'T KNOW -- I DON'T 
19:33:12 KNOW WHAT THIS REALLY DOES FOR US.
19:33:14 
YOU KNOW, I DON'T SEE WHY WE CAN'T 
19:33:20 JUST KEEP THESE THINGS IN PLACE AND CONTINUE TO HAVE OUR OWN LOCAL CONTROL 
19:33:26 OVER WHETHER WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO HAVE A STATE OF EMERGENCY AND A 
19:33:27 EVICTION MORATORIUM.
19:33:31 
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
19:33:33 
NEXT SPEAKER IS ANNIE.
19:33:39 
>> THANK YOU.
19:33:41 
BEFORE I BEGIN SPEAKING CAN YOU LET ME 
19:33:42 KNOW HOW MUCH TIME I  HAVE?
19:33:44 
>> Mayor Mei: ALBERTO, DO YOU HAVE THE 
19:33:44 CLOCK?
19:33:47 
I WAS GOING TO ASK THAT.
19:33:48 
THANK YOU.
19:33:48 
>> GREAT.
19:33:49 
YEAH.
19:33:50 
HELLO, COUNCIL.
19:33:51 
MY NAME IS ANNIE.
19:33:53 
I'M A PROUD FREMONT RESIDENT, QUITE 
19:33:55 FRANKLY I THINK I KNOW MOST OF YOU.
19:33:59 
I ALSO LIVE HERE IN FREMONT, IN A 
19:34:00 RENTAL PROPERTY.
19:34:02 
TONIGHT'S VOTE IS ABOUT A VERY SIMPLE 
19:34:04 QUESTION, DO YOU CARE ABOUT RENTERS?
19:34:06 
I THINK, AT LEAST I HOPE THAT ALL OF 
19:34:07 YOU WOULD SAY YES.
19:34:09 
DON'T REALLY THINK THAT THERE'S ONE 
19:34:14 COUNCILMEMBER THAT WOULD SAY WAIT, ACTUALLY I DON'T CARE ABOUT RENTERS.
19:34:16 
SO IF YOU CARE ABOUT RENTERS, ACT LIKE 
19:34:16 IT!
19:34:18 
ALL OF YOU KNOW THAT HOUSING AND 
19:34:21 SECURITY IS HIGH HERE AND THE COST OF LIVING IS HIGH HERE.
19:34:23 
IT FOLLOWS THEN THAT OUR LOCAL 
19:34:29 EVICTION MORATORIUM SHOULD LAST LONGER AN IF AT ALL POSSIBLE BE STRONGER THAN 
19:34:31 BOTH THE COUNTY AND THE STATE MORATORIUMS.
19:34:33 
YOU SCRAP OUR EVICTION MORATORIUM 
19:34:37 TONIGHT, IT'S NON-EXISTENT, IT'S BASICALLY GAME OVER FOR RENTERS.
19:34:39 
WE'RE AT THE WHIM OF THE COUNTY OR THE 
19:34:44 STATE, AND IT MEANS AS SOON AS THE STATE OR THE COUNTY MORATORIUM ENDS, 
19:34:47 IT'S BASICALLY A FREE FOR ALL THAT COULD LEAVE RENTERS OUT ON THE STREET, 
19:34:50 MAYBE THIS WINTER, MAYBE THIS SPRING, WE DON'T KNOW.
19:34:51 
WE DON'T HAVE ANY CONTROL OVER WHEN 
19:34:53 THE COUNTY OR STATE ENDS THEIR MORATORIUM.
19:34:57 
THROUGH NO FAULT OF RENTERS'  OWN.
19:34:59 
THAT'S SCARY AS A RENTER, QUITE 
19:35:00 FRANKLY.
19:35:03 
IT'S NOT LIKE THE PANDEMIC IS OVER.
19:35:05 
BAY AREA COUNTIES ARE STILL 
19:35:05 RECOMMENDING MASKS INSIDE.
19:35:11 
WE ALL SAW IT ON THE TV AND  KNEW, NEW 
19:35:12 RECOMMENDATION.
19:35:13 
SO TO CLOSE, IF YOU REMEMBER NOTHING 
19:35:17 ELSE OF WHAT I SAID TONIGHT, REMEMBER THIS:  IF YOU VOTE TO END THIS 
19:35:22 EVICTION MORATORIUM, ONE, YOU CEDE ALL OF YOUR CONTROL OVER TO THE COUNTY, 
19:35:26 I'M NOT SURE WHY YOU WOULD WANT TO DO THAT, BUT TWO, IT SENDS A LOUD AND 
19:35:31 CLEAR MESSAGE THAT OUR CITY DOES NOT CARE ENOUGH ABOUT US RENTERS TO AFFORD 
19:35:35 US ANY EXTRA PROTECTION THAN WHAT THE STATE OR THE COUNTY IS GIVING  US.
19:35:36 
THANK YOU.
19:35:43 
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
19:35:45 
THE NEXT SPEAKER IS BLAIR BEEKMAN.
19:35:48 
>> HI.
19:35:49 
THANK YOU.
19:35:50 
BLAIR BEEKMAN HERE.
19:35:53 
THOSE WERE NICE WORDS.
19:35:56 
I'M KIND OF IN THE SAME BOAT.
19:36:01 
IT WAS NICE EXPLANATIONS BY YOUR STAFF 
19:36:05 AND THANK YOU THAT ON A MOMENT'S NOTICE, YOU CAN COME AS A LOCAL 
19:36:10 AGENCY, YOU CAN COME  TO -- YOU CAN GO TO WORK AND IT'S JUST A QUESTION OF 
19:36:14 HOW TO MAKE THAT A BIT MORE OF A GUARANTEED PROCESS FOR  OURSELVES, A 
19:36:16 BIT MORE SECURE PROCESS FOR OURSELVES.
19:36:20 
THE STATE HAS GONE TO SOME GREAT 
19:36:25 LENGTHS, I THINK, AND THEY ARE CLOSER -- I THINK WE ALL ARE  BETTER 
19:36:31 UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS IS A PROCESS OF COVID-19 THAT IS NOT OUR FAULT AS 
19:36:34 LOCAL PEOPLE OF A COMMUNITY, FOR BOTH RENTERS AND OWNERS.
19:36:39 
AND SO WE SHOULD NOT HAVE TO BE HELD 
19:36:43 ACCOUNTABLE TO ITS DEBT BURDEN, OR WE SHOULDN'T HAVE TO BE HELD TOITY DEBT 
19:36:46  TO ITS DEBT BURDEN BASICALLY.
19:36:47 
WE'RE LEARNING HOW TO WALK THROUGH 
19:36:50 THAT TOGETHER, AND IT'S HARD WORK, AND WE JUST HAVE TO LEARN HOW TO BE A BIT 
19:36:52 MORE CLEAR ABOUT IT WITH EACH OTHER.
19:36:57 
I KNOW IN SAN JOSÉ, TO AGAIN MISSION 
19:37:03  AGAIN MENTION SAN JOSÉ, IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT  SEPTEMBER 30TH IS 
19:37:09 AN OFFICIAL DATE FOR SOMETHING, AND AT THAT TIME, I THINK OWNERS CAN 
19:37:16 TECHNICALLY START TO SUE TENANTS BEGINNING IN NOVEMBER.
19:37:18 
BUT MEANWHILE, THE STATE HAS OFFERED 
19:37:22 SOME SORT OF A -- THEY CAN'T REALLY DO THAT UNTIL EITHER NOVEMBER OR NEXT 
19:37:28 SPRING, AND THERE'S TALK OF MARCH 2022 AS DATES AS THE STATE MORATORIUM CAN 
19:37:33 BE FULLY IN PLACE, AND THERE'S JUST A LOT OF BACK AND FORTH, YET AT THE 
19:37:37 LOCAL LEVEL, I THINK THE SEPTEMBER DATE IS AN ISSUE AND A PROBLEM.
19:37:39 
SAN JOSÉ IS WORKING ON HOW RENTERS 
19:37:45 DON'T HAVE TO BE SUED AFTER THE SEPTEMBER 30TH DATE, WHICH IS REALLY 
19:37:49 GOOD WORK, I MEAN, FOR A LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO DO FOR ITS COMMUNITY, 
19:37:52 AND IT CAN BE AN EXAMPLE FOR ALL OF US ACROSS THE STATE BASICALLY.
19:37:53 
LOCAL CITIES.
19:37:58 
SO CHECK OUT THEIR WORK, YOU KNOW, WE 
19:38:03 CAN REALLY FIGHT IT AND REALLY WORK TOWARD OUR BETTER IDEALS AND 
19:38:03 PRINCIPLES AT THIS TIME.
19:38:07 
I MEAN, LIKE WHAT I SAID, WE'RE IN THE 
19:38:12 AREA OF UNDERSTANDING HOW WE DON'T HAVE TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE -- OR NOT HELD 
19:38:15 ACCOUNTABLE, WE DON'T HAVE TO -- WE DON'T HAVE TO PAY FOR THIS MESS 
19:38:16 BASICALLY.
19:38:20 
AND WE'RE LEARNING HOW TO DO THAT, AND 
19:38:25 IT'S A BIT DIFFICULT AND TRICKY, BUT I THINK WE'RE ALL AGREEING IT'S A GOOD 
19:38:28 IDEA ON HOW TO DO IT, IT'S JUST A MATTER OF WE TALK TO EACH OTHER AND BE 
19:38:32 OPEN WITH EACH OTHER AND COMMUNICATE AND KEEP EVERYBODY SAFE AND GOOD AND 
19:38:32 HEALTHY.
19:38:34 
AND THAT WAY WE DON'T HURT EACH OTHER 
19:38:37 NOW AND IN THE FUTURE, AND THAT'S THE GOAL OF THIS WHOLE PROCESS.
19:38:39 
WE DON'T HURT EACH OTHER  ANYMORE.
19:38:39 
THANKS A LOT.
19:38:44 
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
19:38:46 
THE NEXT SPEAKER IS JOHN HINDS.
19:38:46 
WELCOME.
19:38:49 
>> HELLO, EVERYONE.
19:38:52 
THIS COMMENT APPLIES TO ALL THE 
19:38:55 EMERGENCY RULES, NOT JUST THE ONE THAT'S GETTING MORE SPECIFIC ATTENTION 
19:38:55 TONIGHT.
19:39:02 
EMERGENCY RULES ARE WRITTEN THROUGH 
19:39:03 EMERGENCY PROCESSES.
19:39:06 
THAT IS, BYPASSING ALL THE NORMAL 
19:39:11 LEGISLATIVE STEPS AND REVIEW STEPS AND FIRST AND SECOND HEARINGS AND PUBLIC 
19:39:17 INPUT STEPS THAT GIVE OUR RULES THE FULLEST LEGITIMACY, PROCEDURES THAT 
19:39:22 WE'VE HAMMERED OUT OVER YEARS AND DECADES, TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE'S RIGHTS 
19:39:24 AND INTERESTS ARE PROTECTED.
19:39:27 
AND THE IDEA THAT WE COULD EFFECTIVELY 
19:39:33 BE WRITING PERMANENT RULES USING EMERGENCY PROCEDURES IS TROUBLING.
19:39:37 
THESE TEMPORARY RULES, THESE EMERGENCY 
19:39:43 RULES HAVE ONLY PARTIAL LEGITIMACY, AND THE SIMPLEST AND CLEANEST WAY TO 
19:39:48 RETURN TO NORMAL AND ALL THE USUAL RULES WE HAVE TO PROTECT PEOPLE'S 
19:39:54 RIGHTS IS THAT ALL EMERGENCY RULES HAVE TO HAVE AN EXPIRATION DATE, AND WHEN 
19:39:58 THE EXPIRATION DATE IS REACHED, THEY'RE OVER, AND WE CAN MAKE NEW RULES THE 
19:40:02 NORMAL WAY, BUT EMERGENCY RULES CANNOT BE ALLOWED JUST TO LIVE ON FOREVER.
19:40:07 
THANK YOU.
19:40:08 
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
19:40:13 
AND I SEE WE HAVE A COUNCILMEMBER, 
19:40:15 SALWAN, DO YOU HAVE A COMMENT ON THIS ITEM?
19:40:17 
>> Councilmember Salwan: I JUST HAD A 
19:40:18 QUESTION FOR THE CITY ATTORNEY.
19:40:24 
SO WHAT IS THE CURRENT EFFECT OF OUR 
19:40:27 ORDINANCE WHEN WE HAVE THE LAYERING OF THE COUNTY AS WELL AS THE STATE?
19:40:28 
MS.
19:40:31  MARGOLIS SO WITH RESPECT TO THE RESIDENTIAL EVICTION MORATORIUM, WHEN 
19:40:37 THE COUNTY ADOPTED THEIR ORDER, THEY SPECIFICALLY SAID IN THAT ORDER THAT 
19:40:41 IT SUPERSEDES ANY LOCAL CITY REGULATION.
19:40:44 
SO FROM THAT POINT ON, WE HAVE NOT 
19:40:48 BEEN ENFORCING OUR ORDER BECAUSE IT'S SUPERSEDED BY THE COUNTY ORDER.
19:40:51 
SO WE REALLY SAW THIS AS A CLEAN-UP 
19:40:59 ITEM TO JUST -- AS LONG AS THIS IS INEFFECTIVE ANYWAY, LET'S TERMINATE IT 
19:41:02 SO THAT WE HAVE ONE LESS REGULATION ON THE BOOKS THAT WE'RE NOT USING.
19:41:07 
BUT AGAIN, I JUST WANT TO EMPHASIZE 
19:41:12 THAT THE COUNTY'S REGULATION IS STILL IN EFFECT AND THE STATE HAS REGULATION 
19:41:12 AS WELL.
19:41:15 
SO CITIZENS ARE STILL PROTECTED.
19:41:17 
>> Councilmember Salwan: SO WOULD YOU 
19:41:22 SAY THIS LAW IS NO LONGER EFFECTIVE, OR IS INEFFECTUAL?
19:41:22 
MS.
19:41:23  MARGOLIS IT'S NO LONGER NEEDED.
19:41:25 
IT'S NOT ADDING ANYTHING THAT WE DON'T 
19:41:29 ALREADY HAVE, AND IT WAS -- I DON'T BELIEVE IT WAS AS STRONG AS THE 
19:41:30 COUNTY'S ORDER ANYWAY.
19:41:33 
>> Councilmember Salwan: OKAY.
19:41:36 
SO WE'RE REDUCING DUPLICATION AND 
19:41:41 GOING WITH THE COUNTY, AND THEN THE COUNTY HAS TO FOLLOW THE STATE, 
19:41:42 CORRECT?
19:41:42 
OKAY.
19:41:43 
ALL RIGHT.
19:41:43 
THANKS FOR THE CLARIFICATION.
19:41:46 
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
19:41:47 
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN.
19:41:49 
>> Councilmember Kassan: SO JUST TO 
19:41:55 ADD TO THAT CLARIFICATION, IT'S IRRELEVANT UNTIL THE COUNTY DOES AWAY 
19:42:01 WITH ITS STATE OF EMERGENCY OR EVICTION  MORATORIUM.
19:42:03 
AS SOON AS THE COUNTY OR STATE, 
19:42:06 WHICHEVER ONE IS IN EFFECT, DOES AWAY WITH IT, THEN OURS IS NO LONGER IN 
19:42:06 EFFECT.
19:42:10 
SO BASICALLY WE'RE LETTING THE COUNTY 
19:42:14 DECIDE WHEN TO STOP IT INSTEAD OF US MAINTAINING OUR OWN CONTROL OVER WHEN 
19:42:15 TO STOP  IT.
19:42:20 
SO THAT'S MY CONCERN.
19:42:21 
OBVIOUSLY AT THIS MOMENT IT HAS NO 
19:42:24 EFFECT, BECAUSE THE COUNTY CONTINUES TO HAVE A STATE OF EMERGENCY AND 
19:42:27 CONTINUES TO HAVE AN EVICTION MORATORIUM.
19:42:30 
BUT THEY COULD DECIDE TO CHANGE THAT 
19:42:31 TOMORROW, SO THAT'S MY CONCERN.
19:42:33 
MS.
19:42:34  MARGOLIS RIGHT.
19:42:36 
IF THEY WERE TO TERMINATE THEIR 
19:42:40 EMERGENCY TOMORROW AND OURS STAYED IN EFFECT, THEN IT COULD CONTINUE ON, BUT 
19:42:46 PRACTICALLY SPEAKING, WE'RE ALL LIKELY TO BE READY TO TERMINATE THE STATE OF 
19:42:47 EMERGENCY AT ABOUT THE SAME  TIME.
19:42:49 
IT'S GOING TO BE, YOU KNOW, WHEN THE 
19:42:55 STATE GIVES NOTICE THAT IT'S TIME AND HEALTH DIRECTORS AGREE WITH THAT AND 
19:42:56 IT'S TIME TO MOVE FORWARD.
19:42:58 
AND FRANKLY WE THOUGHT WE WERE MOVING 
19:43:01 IN THAT DIRECTION WHEN WE PUT THIS ITEM ON THE AGENDA.
19:43:03 
WE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THE DELTA 
19:43:06 VARIANT, AND YOU KNOW, THINGS HAVE CHANGED A LITTLE BIT IN THE LAST 
19:43:11 COUPLE WEEKS EVEN, BUT WE STILL THINK THIS IS THE RIGHT ACTION TO TAKE AT 
19:43:11 THIS TIME.
19:43:14 
>> Mayor Mei: COUNCILMEMBER JONES.
19:43:15 
>> Councilmember Jones: THANK YOU.
19:43:19 
ACTUALLY CITY ATTORNEY MARGOLIS JUST 
19:43:23 ANSWERED MY QUESTION REGARDING OUR ORDER STAYING IN EFFECT IF THE COUNTY 
19:43:24 DOES PULL THEIRS.
19:43:27 
SO AGAIN TO COUNCILMEMBER  SALWAN'S 
19:43:35 POINT, THIS IS A DUPLICATION, AND ACCORDING TO CITY MANAGER DANAJ, WE 
19:43:41 COULD ACTUALLY INVOKE THIS AGAIN AT OUR DISCRETION IF THE COUNTY DOES, SAY, 
19:43:46 FOR INSTANCE, PULL THIS TOMORROW, HE COULD INVOKE THAT AGAIN AT THE 
19:43:52 RECOMMENDATION AND IT COULD COME BACK FOR COUNCIL APPROVAL AT A LATER  DATE.
19:43:53 
IS THAT CORRECT?
19:43:53 
MS.
19:43:54  MARGOLIS THAT'S CORRECT.
19:43:57 .
19:43:57 
>> Councilmember Jones: THANK YOU.
19:43:58 
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
19:44:00 
I WAS JUST GOING TO MAKE A REGULAR 
19:44:00 COMMENT ON THIS ITEM.
19:44:02 
WHEN THIS CAME BEFORE US, WE ACTUALLY 
19:44:08 AS A CITY WERE IN ADVANCE OF THE COUNTY WITH THE EMERGENCY ORDINANCES FOR 
19:44:15 SEVERAL OF THEM, FOR FIRST THE CLOSURE OF OUR OFFICE TO BEING REMOTE WORKING 
19:44:22 AND REMOTE ONLINE, OUR MEETINGS, AND WE ACTUALLY WERE IN ADVANCE OF THE COUNTY 
19:44:26 FOR THE EVICTION MORATORIUM, AND WE HAD PASSED THAT AS A COUNCIL.
19:44:29 
I HAD ALSO SPOKEN AT THAT TIME WHEN 
19:44:35 THE COUNTY DECIDED IN THEIR EMERGENCY ORDINANCE TO SUPERSEDE THE CITY'S, AND 
19:44:42 SO I FOLLOWED THE HEARINGS ON THAT AND ACTUALLY SPOKE OUT IN DEFENSE OF THE 
19:44:49 CITIES HAVE LOCAL CONTROL, BUT AS THEY SUPERSEDED US AT THAT TIME, IT 
19:44:52 RESULTED IN DUPLICATION WHICH WAS BASICALLY INEFFECTUAL AND NOT 
19:44:53 CURRENTLY PERTINENT.
19:44:55 
AND I DO AGREE WITH ONE OF THE 
19:44:58 SPEAKERS EARLIER'S COMMENT WHICH IS, IT'S AN EMERGENCY ORDINANCE WHICH WAS 
19:45:01 PASSED FOR AN EMERGENCY AT THIS TIME.
19:45:07 
WE DO RESERVE THE RIGHT AS A COUNCIL, 
19:45:10 WORKING WITH OUR CITY MANAGER IF WE SHOULD NEED TO, TO INVOKE ANOTHER 
19:45:14 EMERGENCY ORDINANCE IF WE FELT THERE WAS A NEED TO DO SO, AS WE WATCH AND 
19:45:16 MONITOR THE STATE OF THINGS  MOVING FORWARD.
19:45:18 
BUT I DO AGREE THAT AN EMERGENCY 
19:45:22 ORDINANCE IS NOT MEANT TO BE A PERMANENT ORDINANCE, AND SO THAT WE 
19:45:26 NEED TO LOOK AT AND EVALUATE THE SITUATION AS IT SHOULD  ARISE, AND SO, 
19:45:31 THEREFORE, I'D BE INTERESTED IN SUPPORTING THIS CLARIFICATION AND 
19:45:33 REMOVAL AND CHANGE.
19:45:34 
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN.
19:45:35 
>> Councilmember Salwan: I WAS ALSO 
19:45:40 GOING TO MAKE A GENERAL STATEMENT THAT, YOU KNOW, A PART OF THE CONFUSION FOR 
19:45:44 THE PUBLIC WAS THAT WE HAD EVERY CITY DOING THEIR OWN THING, AND SO WE HAD 
19:45:49 CITIES HAD DIFFERENT RULES, YOU HAD THE COUNTY DOING THEIR OWN THING, YOU HAD 
19:45:54 THE STATE DOING DIFFERENT THINGS AND IT CREATED A LOT OF CONFUSION AND PANIC.
19:45:57 
SO AS A POLICY, I THINK WE WANTED TO 
19:46:01 MOVE UP THE DECISION-MAKING, UNLESS WE HAVE A LOCAL CONCERN, WE CAN ALWAYS 
19:46:05 ACT FASTER, BUT IN GENERAL, I THINK IT'S A GOOD DEFERENCE TO WORK WITH A 
19:46:05 LARGER ORGANIZATION.
19:46:08 
WE ARE A GENERAL LAW CITY, SO ALL OF 
19:46:09 THE LAWS OF THE STATE DO APPLY TO US.
19:46:11 
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
19:46:12 
COUNCILMEMBER COX.
19:46:14 
>> Councilmember Cox: YES.
19:46:18 
I THINK THAT IT WOULD HELP IF WE ADDED 
19:46:25 SOMETHING ON OUR WEBSITE THAT COULD BE COMMUNICATED SO THAT EVERYONE KIND OF 
19:46:31 UNDERSTANDS THE SITUATION THAT EVERYTHING IS, YOU KNOW, NO EFFECT AT 
19:46:39 THIS POINT UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE SO THAT PEOPLE ARE NOT PANICKING WHEN THEY 
19:46:44 FIRST READ SOMETHING AND THEY MAY NOT READ IN DEPTH BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE SO 
19:46:48 BUSY WITH THEIR LIVES AND UNDERSTANDING EVERYTHING THAT IT WOULD JUST BE VERY 
19:46:58 HELPFUL, IF CITY STAFF COMMUNICATIONS, MARK CAN WORK WITH DEBRA ON 
19:47:02 APPROPRIATE WORDING THAT CAN HELP US ON OUR WEBSITE TO COMMUNICATE, SO THERE'S 
19:47:07 NO PANIC AND NO FLOOD OF CALLS TO CITY HALL AND ALL OF US MEMBERS OF CITY 
19:47:13 LEADERSHIP, THAT WE JUST DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO GO INTO A PANIC AND MISREAD 
19:47:15 THIS OR MISUNDERSTAND IT, MISUNDERSTOOD.
19:47:19 
>> City Manager Danaj: YES, WE CAN DO 
19:47:19 THAT.
19:47:20 
VERY GOOD IDEA.
19:47:23 
>> Mayor Mei: YES, AND I KNOW THAT WE 
19:47:31 ALREADY ADDED THAT CLARIFICATION ON TO OUR WEBSITE EARLIER AND SOCIAL MEDIA 
19:47:35 FOR THE CITY, BUT AS WE ARE UPDATING THIS, WE CAN SEND OUT A REMINDER AGAIN.
19:47:36 
>> City Manager Danaj: RIGHT.
19:47:38 
WE DID DO A POSTING ON ALL OF OUR 
19:47:43 SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS AROUND THIS SPECIFIC AGENDA ITEM AND SORT OF 
19:47:45 UNDERSCORING WHAT IT'S REALLY DOING AND WHAT IT'S NOT DOING.
19:47:49 
BUT COUNCILMEMBER COX, WE WILL 
19:47:54 REINFORCE THAT WITH MORE GENERAL COMMUNICATION ABOUT WHAT THE COUNTY 
19:47:56 RULES ARE AND WHY THEY'RE IN PLACE.
19:47:58 
>> Mayor Mei: COUNCILMEMBER  SHAO.
19:48:01 
OR VICE MAYOR SHAO.
19:48:02 
>> Vice Mayor Shao: I WOULD JUST LIKE 
19:48:06 TO MAKE A MOTION FOR THIS ITEM 2O.
19:48:08 
TO APPROVE.
19:48:16 
>> Mayor Mei: DO I HAVE A SECOND?
19:48:20 
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN.
19:48:28 
CAN I HAVE A ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE?
19:48:29 
>> Mr.
19:48:29  Quintanilla: YES.
19:48:31 
COUNCILMEMBER COX, AYE.
19:48:33 
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN, AYE.
19:48:37 
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, NO.
19:48:39 
COUNCILMEMBER JONES, AYE.
19:48:43 
COUNCILMEMBER KENG, NO.
19:48:45 
VICE MAYOR SHAO, AYE.
19:48:49 
MAYOR MEI, AYE.
19:48:51 
>> Mayor Mei: THE MOTION PASSES WITH 
19:49:00 FOUR AYES AND --  ACTUALLY -- I THINK IT'S FIVE AYES AND TWO NOS, 
19:49:01 COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN AND COUNCILMEMBER KENG.
19:49:02 
THANK YOU.
19:49:05 
SO FIVE AYES.
19:49:06 
MY APOLOGIES ON THAT.
19:49:12 
AT THIS TIME, WE'LL RETURN TO OUR 
19:49:17 REGULAR AGENDA ITEMS,  BEGINNING WITH ITEM 5A.
19:49:20 
WHICH IS THE ARDENWOOD OFFICE PARK 
19:49:23 EMERGENCY VEHICLE ACCESS EASEMENT VACATION.
19:49:30 
AND WE HAVE HANS LARSEN AVAILABLE FOR 
19:49:30 THIS ITEM.
19:49:40 
ALSO COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT DIRECTOR 
19:49:42 DAN SCHOENHOLZ.
19:49:44 
AND ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE 
19:49:46 COUNCIL MEMBERS AT THIS TIME ON THIS ITEM?
19:49:47 
ITEM 5A?
19:49:56 
SEEING NONE, I SEE THAT WE HAVE ONE -- 
19:50:01 WE'RE GOING TO OPEN THE PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD AND I SEE BLAIR BEEKMAN HAS 
19:50:02 THEIR -- HAS HIS HAND RAISED.
19:50:03 
>> HI.
19:50:04 
THANK YOU.
19:50:07 
BLAIR BEEKMAN HERE.
19:50:08 
THANK YOU FOR THIS ITEM.
19:50:15 
THESE ARE NATURAL DISASTER 
19:50:18 PREPAREDNESS ISSUES, I GUESS, OR OES PREPAREDNESS ISSUES.
19:50:18 
SO THANK YOU.
19:50:23 
I'M LEARNING A BIT OF THE LANGUAGE 
19:50:24 ABOUT IT.
19:50:27 
LIKE I'VE BEEN TRYING TO SAY HERE, WE 
19:50:32 HAVE CONCERNS IN THE NEXT TWO TO FIVE TO 10 YEARS IN THE BAY AREA.
19:50:36 
THERE'S WILDFIRE, THERE IS WILDFIRE 
19:50:40 CONCERNS, THERE'S SEA LEVEL RISE CONCERNS, AND WHAT I FEEL COULD BE A 
19:50:44 POSSIBLE LARGE EARTHQUAKE IN THE NEXT FEW  YEARS.
19:50:48 
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S ACCURATE BUT IT 
19:50:51 CERTAINLY IMPORTANT TO ADD TO YOUR EMERGENCY PLANNING AT THIS TIME, AND 
19:51:00 I'D LIKE TO THANK MAYOR MEI FOR HER WORDS THAT SHE WOULD LIKE SOME SORT OF 
19:51:03 CLOSURE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TO CALL THIS EMERGENCY SITUATION OF COVID WE'RE IN.
19:51:07 
I JUST QUICKLY LOOKED UP THAT ALAMEDA 
19:51:12 COUNTY, THEIR EVICTION MORATORIUM ENDS 60 DAYS AFTER DECEMBER 31ST, 2021.
19:51:15 
THAT'S BASICALLY MARCH OF 2021.
19:51:17 
SO I GUESS THAT'S THE DIRECTIVE WE'RE 
19:51:23 FOLLOWING, AND THAT SHOULD OFFER SOME GUARANTEE FOR OURSELVES AS THIS TIME, 
19:51:28 BUT LIKE WHAT I MENTIONED, THERE'S A BIT OF NUANCE AT THE END OF SEPTEMBER, 
19:51:35 I THINK THE STATE LAWS HAVE ALLOWED THAT THERE CAN BE A BIT OF A THEME 
19:51:40 THAT OWNERS CAN SUE TENANTS AFTER  SEPTEMBER 30TH, AND THEN THEY CAN'T GO 
19:51:44 TO COURT UNTIL, SAY, NOVEMBER OR THE FOLLOWING MARCH, 2022.
19:51:46 
AND THAT'S WHAT SAN JOSÉ WANTS TO 
19:51:49 ADDRESS AND THAT'S THE SORT OF POWER THAT THEY WANT AT THE LOCAL LEVEL.
19:51:56 
GOOD LUCK HOW YOU CAN ADDRESS THAT AS 
19:51:56 THE CITY OF FREMONT.
19:52:00 
IT'S A POWERFUL ISSUE THAT SAN JOSÉ IS 
19:52:05 TRYING TO ADDRESS AND WE'VE GOT TO GIVE THEM A LOT OF CREDIT FOR WORKING ON 
19:52:06 IT, I THOUGHT I'D MENTION IT AT THIS TIME.
19:52:08 
GOOD LUCK WITH OES ISSUES.
19:52:11 
OES ISSUES ARE DIFFICULT, ESPECIALLY 
19:52:16 AT THIS TIME, AND I THINK WE CAN STILL OFFER HOPE TO EACH OTHER IF WE WORK 
19:52:19 TOWARDS OUR BETTER IDEALS AND PRACTICES.
19:52:26 
IT'S THOSE EFFORTS THAT IS WHAT CAN 
19:52:29 CARRY US THROUGH THE DIFFICULT TIMES IF WE DO COME UP TO NATURAL DISASTERS IN 
19:52:30 THE FUTURE.
19:52:33 
IT'S NOT SIMPLY FALLING BACK ON FOSSIL 
19:52:36 FUEL USE AND SAYING WE'VE GOT TO GIVE IN TO THAT WHOLE SYSTEM.
19:52:40 
LET'S MAKE THIS A TIME TO REALLY 
19:52:41 CONSIDER HOW TO MOVE FORWARD.
19:52:45 
IT'S WITH THAT THAT ONCE THOSE BAD 
19:52:48 THINGS HAPPEN THAT WE CAN THEN RETURN TO JUST OUR GOOD IDEALISM THAT WE WANT 
19:52:54 TO DO, AND IT WILL MAKE FOR A SMOOTHER TRANSITION, I FEEL, AND MAKE THINGS 
19:52:55 EASIER TO UNDERSTAND.
19:52:57 
THAT GOES WITH OPEN PUBLIC POLICY 
19:52:58 IDEAS TOO.
19:52:58 
THANK YOU.
19:53:03 
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
19:53:05 
AND AT THIS TIME, I'M GOING TO CLOSE 
19:53:10 THE PUBLIC COMMENT ON THIS ITEM AND RETURN IT BACK TO THE COUNCIL.
19:53:12 
ARE THERE ANY CLARIFYING QUESTIONS OR 
19:53:17 DO I HAVE A MOTION ON THIS ITEM?
19:53:18 
>> Councilmember Jones: I'LL MOVE TO 
19:53:18 APPROVE.
19:53:19 
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
19:53:21 
MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER JONES.
19:53:23 
SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER  SALWAN.

19:53:50 
>> Mayor Mei: AND THE MOTION FOR ITEM 
19:53:51 5A PASSES UNANIMOUSLY.
19:53:57 
NEXT WILL BE ITEM 5B AS IN BOY, WHICH 
19:54:00 IS AMENDMENTS TO THE CITY OF FREMONT MASTER FEE SCHEDULE.
19:54:04 
AND THE RECREATION FACILITY USE POLICY.
19:54:09 
AND OUR BUSINESS MANAGER, DEIRDRE 
19:54:11 ROCKEFELLER-RAMSEY IS AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS THIS EVENING.
19:54:15 
AND FIRST, ARE THERE ANY  CLARIFYING 
19:54:16 QUESTIONS FROM THE COUNCIL?
19:54:19 
MS.
19:54:21  MARGOLIS COUNCILMEMBER MEI, I THINK THAT IS THE WRONG ITEM.
19:54:24 
>> Mayor Mei: SORRY?
19:54:25 
MS.
19:54:28  MARGOLIS I THINK THAT WAS FROM LAST WEEK'S AGENDA.
19:54:33 
>> Mayor Mei: YES -- MS.
19:54:37  MARGOLIS CITY OF FREMONT --
>> Mayor Mei: GOT IT.
19:54:39 
THAT'S FOR MY CEREMONIAL.
19:54:41 
YES, YOU ARE CORRECT, IT'S THE CIVIL 
19:54:45 PENALTY SCHEDULE AND TO ADOPT A RESOLUTION AMENDING  THIS, AND THAT IS 
19:54:50 ALSO, THOUGH, AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS IS DEIRDRE ROCKEFELLER-RAMSEY.
19:54:51 
MY APOLOGIES ON THAT.
19:54:55 
AND THEN ALSO AVAILABLE IS CHIEF 
19:54:57 PETERSEN, I THINK, IF WE HAVE QUESTIONS.
19:54:59 
ARE THERE ANY CLARIFYING QUESTIONS 
19:54:59 FROM THE COUNCIL?
19:55:10 
SEEING NONE, I'M GOING TO OPEN THE 
19:55:10 PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD.
19:55:13 
MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WISHING TO SPEAK 
19:55:17 MAY DO SO BY PRESSING THE RAISE HAND ICON OR PRESSING STAR NINE.
19:55:31 
THE FIRST SPEAKER I SEE IS  TAWNEY.
19:55:32 
>> THANK YOU, MAYOR MEI AND CITY 
19:55:32 COUNCIL MEMBERS.
19:55:35 
I'M HERE TONIGHT TO SPEAK ON THIS 
19:55:41 ITEM, REALLY DEFINITELY IN SUPPORT OF RAISING THE FINES, HOWEVER, I FEEL 
19:55:46 THAT THE AMOUNT THAT YOU'RE PROPOSING IS ACTUALLY NOT EVEN HIGH ENOUGH.
19:55:51 
THE REALITY IS RIGHT NOW THE CITY 
19:55:56 HASN'T BEEN HANDING OUT THE CITATIONS, NOR HAS IT BEEN ENFORCING ANYTHING, 
19:56:04 AND SO REALLY, ALMOST, YOU KNOW, WHAT'S THE POINT OF HAVING ANY OF THESE 
19:56:07 SCHEDULE FEES AND THINGS IF WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE THIS ENFORCED.
19:56:10 
AND I BRING THIS UP BECAUSE MY FAMILY 
19:56:16 HAS BEEN DEALING WITH THIS SITUATION NOW FOR ONE YEAR, WE'RE SIX WEEKS SHY 
19:56:20 OF ONE YEAR NOW, WHERE RENTERS MOVED IN NEXT DOOR TO US, THEY HAVE DOGS, TWO 
19:56:26 PIT BULLS WHO THEY PUT OUT IN THEIR BACKYARD 24/7, AND WE'RE DEALING WITH, 
19:56:31 YOU KNOW, BARKING FOR THE LAST 323 DAYS.
19:56:34 
IN THE LAST 323 DAYS, I'M LUCKY IF I 
19:56:38 HAVE SLEPT MAYBE A THOUSAND HOURS.
19:56:40 
TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF WHAT EIGHT 
19:56:50 HOURS A NIGHT OF SLEEP WOULD BE, THAT'S BE 2,584 HOURS OF SLEEP.
19:56:51 
I MAYBE HAVE HAD A THOUSAND HOURS OF 
19:56:51 SLEEP.
19:56:54 
I REPORTED THEM TO THE CITY BACK ON 
19:56:54 DECEMBER 23RD.
19:56:56 
I'VE BEEN DEALING WITH SEVEN MONTHS OF 
19:57:01 QUOTE-UNQUOTE EDUCATION FROM ANIMAL CONTROL SERVICES AND ALL THE PROPER 
19:57:07 PROTOCOLS AND ALL THE WHATEVERS, AND YET THEY'VE HAD ZERO CITATIONS.
19:57:08 
ZERO.
19:57:09 
NONE, RIGHT?
19:57:11 
AND EVEN THIS MORNING, 4:20 A.M.
19:57:12  4:20 A.M.
19:57:18 , YOU KNOW, I WAS WOKEN BY THESE DOGS BEFORE I HAVE TO GO TO WORK.
19:57:21 
I AM EVERY DAY BEYOND EXHAUSTED.
19:57:24 
THE STATE OF MY HEALTH, NOT ONLY MY 
19:57:26 PHYSICAL HEALTH BUT MY MENTAL HEALTH HAS REALLY BEEN CHANGED.
19:57:29 
I'M A DIFFERENT PERSON THAN I WAS A 
19:57:34 YEAR AGO, AND I'M GOING TO TELL YOU THAT, YOU KNOW, 27 YEARS OF OWNING A 
19:57:39 HOME IN THIS CITY, BEING GOOD TAXPAYERS, BEING GOOD COMMUNITY 
19:57:43 STEWARDS, GOOD COMMUNITY CITIZENS, AND YET WE HAVE NO ENFORCEMENT, WE HAVE NO 
19:57:45 HELP.
19:57:50 
I REALLY THINK YOU OUGHT TO BE 
19:57:51 IMPOSING THE MAXIMUMS.
19:57:55 
GO FOR $250, 500 AND A THOUSAND 
19:57:55 DOLLARS.
19:57:57 
A THOUSAND DOLLARS, YOU CAN DO THE THIRD.
19:57:59 
IF YOU'RE GOING TO GIVE SEVEN MONTHS 
19:58:02 OF WARNINGS AND SEVEN MONTHS OF EDUCATION, AT SOME POINT, YOU'VE GOT 
19:58:03 TO CITE THESE PEOPLE.
19:58:04 
RIGHT?
19:58:07 
YOU'VE GOT TO HELP THE PEOPLE WHO ARE 
19:58:09 BEING -- WHO ARE THE ONES WHO ARE SUFFERING AROUND THEM.
19:58:11 
AND IT ISN'T JUST MY FAMILY.
19:58:12 
THERE ARE FIVE OTHER FAMILIES WHO 
19:58:17 SIGNED A PETITION IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD SURROUNDING THAT HOME.
19:58:21 
SO I URGE YOU TO, YOU KNOW, ADOPT THIS 
19:58:25 BUT EVEN TAKE IT HIGHER THAN WHAT YOU'RE PROPOSING.
19:58:25 
SO THANK YOU.
19:58:32 
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
19:58:37 
THE NEXT SPEAKER ON THIS ITEM IS RON.
19:58:42 
>> HELLO.
19:58:44 
MY NAME IS RON WARREN.
19:58:46 
I'VE LIVED HERE IN THE COMMUNITY FOR 
19:58:48 ALMOST 30 YEARS.
19:58:53 
AND IN THIS HOME, AND WE'VE HAD A 
19:59:02 VARIETY OF NEIGHBORS AND, YOU KNOW, THERE'S CERTAIN COMMUNITY STANDARDS 
19:59:06 WE'VE GENERALLY  ADHERED TO, AND PERIODICALLY I'LL HAVE SOMEBODY THAT 
19:59:12 DOESN'T, YOU KNOW, ISN'T WILLING OR ABLE TORE -- TO, YOU KNOW, ADHERE TO 
19:59:16 THOSE THINGS, AND THAT'S THE NUISANCE ISSUE.
19:59:18 
AND IT COMES TO A QUALITY OF LIVING 
19:59:22 WITHIN FREMONT, AND IT'S JUST LIKE, YOU KNOW, IF YOU WANT TO HAVE A COMMUNITY 
19:59:28 WITH BARS ON THE WINDOWS OR BARBED WIRE OR CARS PARKED IN YARDS.
19:59:30 
THERE ARE LITTLE THINGS THAT MAKE A 
19:59:34 BIG DIFFERENCE IN THE QUALITY OF LIVING, AND ONE THING IS, YOU KNOW, IF 
19:59:39 WE HAVE, YOU KNOW, QUALITY OF LIVING  OFFENSES, THEY NEED TO BE ADDRESSED.
19:59:42 
ONE WAY THAT CAN BE EFFECTIVE IS 
19:59:46 FINANCIAL, BASICALLY FINE PEOPLE FOR, YOU KNOW, BREAKING THOSE STANDARDS AND 
19:59:52 TO TRY TO GET -- EDUCATE, GET THEM INTO THE PART OF MAKING THIS A BETTER 
19:59:53 COMMUNITY.
19:59:58 
AND THAT'S ALL I HAD TO SAY.
19:59:59 
THANK YOU.
20:00:05 
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
20:00:06 
I'M GOING TO CLOSE THE PUBLIC COMMENT 
20:00:11 PERIOD ON THIS ITEM AND BRING IT BACK TO OUR COUNCILMEMBERS.
20:00:14 
AND I SEE COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN HAS HER 
20:00:15 HAND RAISED.
20:00:16 
>> Councilmember Kassan: THANK YOU.
20:00:19 
SO I KNOW THAT THIS IS A BIG ISSUE FOR 
20:00:25 A LOT OF OUR RESIDENTS WHO HAVE THE MISFORTUNE TO LIVE NEXT DOOR TO DOGS 
20:00:32 LIKE RAMBO AND REIEFL, WHO ARE INCREDIBLY DISTURBING, AND I HAPPEN TO 
20:00:36 KNOW ABOUT THIS CASE BECAUSE IT WAS BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION BY A COMMUNITY 
20:00:41 RESIDENT, AND I DID SPEAK TO STAFF ABOUT IT, I ASKED THAT IT BE HANDLED.
20:00:43 
THERE WAS A SEPARATE ISSUE RELATED TO 
20:00:48 THE DANGEROUSNESS OF THE DOGS, AND THAT WAS HANDLED IN A DIFFERENT WAY, BUT 
20:00:53 THE NOISE ISSUE HAS NEVER BEEN HANDLED, AND THIS IS A CASE WHERE I AND I THINK 
20:00:56 OTHER COUNCILMEMBERS HAVE BROUGHT TO STAFF'S ATTENTION, SO IT JUST REALLY 
20:01:00 MAKES ME WONDER WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH THIS.
20:01:02 
YOU KNOW, IT JUST -- IT'S BEEN GOING 
20:01:10 ON FOR SO LONG, AND IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE ANY ACTION HAS BEEN TAKEN.
20:01:13 
I'M DEFINITELY IN FAVOR OF THIS CHANGE 
20:01:16 TO THE FINES BUT WHAT IS THE POINT IF THEY'RE NOT BEING USED.
20:01:17 
SO I'D LIKE TO HEAR FROM STAFF IF 
20:01:20 POSSIBLE ABOUT WHAT IS  HAPPENING WITH THE IMPOSITION OF FINES.
20:01:22 
AND I ALSO HEARD THAT WITH THE NEW 
20:01:26 NOISE ORDINANCE, THAT THE POLICE DEPARTMENT HADN'T BEEN TRAINED ON THAT 
20:01:31 YET, AND SO THAT WHEN PEOPLE CALLED AND SAID, OH, YOU KNOW, THERE'S SUPPOSED 
20:01:35 TO BE THESE PENALTIES AND FINES FOR NOISE, THAT THE PEOPLE AT THE POLICE 
20:01:40 DEPARTMENT DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT IT, SO I WOULD JUST LOVE TO HEAR WHERE WE'RE AT 
20:01:44 WITH ALL OF THIS AND SEE IF WE CAN GET SOME SORT OF FACTION HERE.
20:01:51 
>> City Manager Danaj: I'LL ASK 
20:01:52 CAPTAIN WASHINGTON TO BRIEFLY COMMENT TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION.
20:01:55 
I DO KNOW THAT THE POLICE DEPARTMENT 
20:01:59 HAS BEEN IN ACTIVE COMMUNICATION WITH THIS PARTICULAR FAMILY.
20:02:02 
ALSO WITH THE NEIGHBOR AS WELL, BUT WE 
20:02:04 HAVE YET TO BRING A RESOLUTION TO IT.
20:02:07 
BUT I WOULD ASSUME AND I WOULD ASSURE 
20:02:12 YOU THAT WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN, THAT THE MUNI CODE PROVIDES FOR RIGHT 
20:02:17 NOW, BUT I'LL LET CAPTAIN WASHINGTON  WHO'S HERE ON BEHALF OF CHIEF PETERSEN 
20:02:18 TO PERHAPS OFFER SOME MORE SPECIFICS.
20:02:22 
>> CHIEF WASHINGTON:  YES, THANK YOU, 
20:02:26 CITY MANAGER, AND COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN.
20:02:28 
SO ON THAT PARTICULAR CASE, I HAVE 
20:02:34 SOME FAMILIARITY WITH IT BUT NOT COMPLETE FAMILIARITY WITH THAT 
20:02:34 PARTICULAR INCIDENT.
20:02:37 
BUT AS A POLICE DEPARTMENT, WE ATTEMPT 
20:02:41 TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO EDUCATE THE PUBLIC FIRST AND THEN USE ENFORCEMENT 
20:02:42 IF NECESSARY TO GAIN COMPLIANCE.
20:02:46 
SO I WOULD HAVE TO GO BACK AND DO A 
20:02:52 MORE COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF HOW WE'VE ISSUED THESE TYPE OF SIMPLE PENALTIES 
20:02:57 IN THE PAST, AND HOW THEY'RE APPLIED, BUT WE'VE HAD CLEAR DIRECTION TO OUR 
20:03:03 STAFF, YOU KNOW, WHEN IT'S APPROPRIATE, WE WILL ISSUE CERTAIN CIVIL PENALTIES 
20:03:05 AS APPROPRIATE.
20:03:09 
SO MORE STUDY OF THE ISSUE IS 
20:03:14 WARRANTED AT THIS PARTICULAR POINT, BUT IT'S CERTAINLY AN ISSUE THAT I WILL 
20:03:17 TAKE BACK TO MY STAFF AND DISCUSS A BIT FURTHER.
20:03:20 
>> City Manager Danaj: WE CAN ALSO 
20:03:23 PROVIDE AN INFORMATIONAL EMAIL ON THIS PARTICULAR INCIDENT.
20:03:27 
>> Councilmember Kassan: I'M JUST -- 
20:03:31 I'M REALLY GLAD TO HEAR THAT YOU'RE WANTING TO ADDRESS THIS PARTICULAR 
20:03:34 INCIDENT, BUT I DO THINK IT IS LIKE MORE THAN JUST THIS INCIDENT.
20:03:37 
YOU KNOW, IT JUST -- THERE IS THIS NEW 
20:03:40 NOISE ORDINANCE, IT WAS PASSED TO MAKE IT EASIER TO HAVE CONSEQUENCES FOR 
20:03:42 NOISE ISSUES.
20:03:46 
THE LAST I HEARD POLICE DEPARTMENT 
20:03:47 STAFF HADN'T BEEN TRAINED ON THAT YET.
20:03:49 
I'M JUST WONDERING, YOU KNOW, WHAT IS 
20:03:54 HAPPENING WITH THE ENFORCEMENT OF THE NOISE ORDINANCE, AND HOW MANY MONTHS 
20:03:57 HAVE TO GO BY BEFORE SOMEONE GETS THAT FIRST CITATION?
20:04:03 
>> CAPTAIN WASHINGTON:  YES, I 
20:04:03 UNDERSTAND YOUR QUESTION COMPLETELY.
20:04:05 
WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF  ENSURING 
20:04:11 THAT OUR STAFF IS  TRAINED PROPERLY ON THIS PARTICULAR ORDINANCE, AND  
20:04:12 ISSUING THESE PARTICULAR CITATIONS.
20:04:15 
WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS ENSURE THAT WE 
20:04:23 HAVE PROPER TRAINING SO THAT WE ISSUE THEM IN AN APPROPRIATE MANNER AND WE 
20:04:28 DON'T CAUSE ANY OTHER ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH ISSUING THE PENALTY.
20:04:31 
SO I WILL DEFINITELY CHECK BACK IN 
20:04:34 WITH STAFF TO SEE WHERE WE ARE, BUT I KNOW THAT HAS BEEN TALKED ABOUT AND WE 
20:04:39 ARE MOVING FORWARD IN GETTING OUR STAFF UP TO SPEED SO WE CAN START ENFORCING 
20:04:42 THE NEW ORDINANCES AS YOU SUGGESTED.
20:04:48 
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
20:04:50 
CLARIFYING QUESTION OR COMMENT, 
20:04:51 COUNCILMEMBER COX.
20:04:51 
>> Councilmember Cox: YES.
20:04:57 
I WOULD LIKE TO ALSO ADD ON THAT ONCE 
20:05:01 THE CAPTAIN WASHINGTON -- ONCE THE TRAINING HAS BEEN COMPLETED WITH YOUR 
20:05:05 STAFF, IF THERE COULD BE A VISIT BACK OUT TO THE SITE BECAUSE IT'S BEEN 
20:05:13 SINCE MAY THE 26TH, AS I KNOW THAT COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN AND MYSELF HAD 
20:05:17 FOLLOWED UP ON THIS INITIATIVE, THAT IN LIGHT OF THE TRAINING AND LIGHT OF THE 
20:05:22 NEW ORDINANCES REGARDING ANIMAL OWNERSHIP, DANGEROUS DOGS OR VICIOUS 
20:05:29 DOGS, THINGS ALONG THOSE NATURE, THAT WE RE-ASSESS THE SITUATION AND MAKE 
20:05:36 SURE THAT THERE'S SOME FORM OF COMPLIANCE.
20:05:38 
IT'S UNFORTUNATE WHEN WE HEAR ABOUT 
20:05:42 RESIDENTS NOT GETTING SLEEP FOR SO MANY MONTHS AND THE DANGER AND ALSO 
20:05:47 REGARDING ANIMALS GETTING HURT AND  FAMILIES GETTING HURT WITH CHILDREN.
20:05:49 
THAT WE REALLY TAKE THIS AS A FIRST 
20:05:53 PRIORITY AS COMMUNITY SAFETY, AND THAT WE RE-ASSESS EVERYTHING BECAUSE I 
20:06:01 THINK WITH THE NEW MEASURES COMING INTO BEING FOR THIS NEW CIVIL PENALTY 
20:06:04 SCHEDULE, BUT ALSO THE TRAINING THAT'S NEEDED TO MAKE SURE IT'S CARRIED OUT 
20:06:10 SUCCESSFULLY, IT WOULD BE VERY MUCH OBLIGED IF YOU COULD SCHEDULE SOME 
20:06:17 TIME WITH THAT RESIDENT, TAWNEY WARREN, AND VISIT THE SITE AND JUST MAKE SURE 
20:06:22 THAT WE'RE RE-ASSESSING AND LOOKING AT EVERYTHING WITH THE NEW LANDSCAPE OF 
20:06:26 ALL THESE NEW CHANGES THAT ARE BEING IMPLEMENTED RIGHT NOW, IT WOULD BE 
20:06:26 GREATLY APPRECIATED.
20:06:34 
>> WE WILL DEFINITELY TAKE THIS BACK 
20:06:36 TO STAFF AND HAVE SOME FURTHER DISCUSSION ON THIS PARTICULAR MATTER.
20:06:39 
>> Councilmember Cox: THANK YOU.
20:06:41 
>> Mayor Mei: COUNCILMEMBER  KENG.
20:06:42 
>> Councilmember Keng: THANK  YOU, 
20:06:42 MAYOR MEI.
20:06:46 
SO ALSO I'M WONDERING, WITH THE 
20:06:54 IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS -- THE FEES ARE WE GOING TO HAVE SOME KIND OF 
20:07:00 COMMUNITY NOTIFICATION, BECAUSE JUST A COUPLE DAYS AGO, WE WERE APPROACHED BY 
20:07:06 A BUSINESS OWNER ANTIQUE STORE IN NILES, AND THEY ARE SAYING THAT, YOU 
20:07:13 KNOW, THE STREET PARKING, THE TWO HOUR PARKING LIMIT, IT WAS NEVER ENFORCED 
20:07:21 AND, YOU KNOW, CUSTOMERS ARE WELCOME TO SHOP AROUND LONGER AND THEN THEY -- 
20:07:24 RECENTLY THEY STARTED TO HAVE CUSTOMERS THAT HAVE BEEN  TICKETED.
20:07:30 
SO THAT'S KIND OF, YOU KNOW, 
20:07:31 CONCERNING FOR THEIR BUSINESS.
20:07:33 
SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO 
20:07:37 HAVE SOME KIND OF EDUCATION AND KIND OF OUTREACH TO THE BUSINESS OWNERS.
20:07:43  IN THE AREA OR CITYWIDE, I DON'T KNOW HOW WE DO THAT.
20:07:55 
>> CAPTAIN WASHINGTON:  UNDERSTOOD, 
20:07:57 PART OF OUR EDUCATION IS TO HAVE COMMUNICATION WITH THE PUBLIC AS WELL, 
20:07:59 SO THAT EMBEDDED AS WE MOVE FORWARD.
20:08:02 
>> Councilmember Keng: GREAT.
20:08:02 
THANK YOU.
20:08:05 
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
20:08:07 
I JUST WANTED TO MAKE A COMMENT ON THIS.
20:08:10 
I WANTED TO NOTE THAT I KNOW -- I 
20:08:14 DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT A SPECIFIC CASE, BUT I DO KNOW THAT IN SOME OF 
20:08:18 THESE  INCIDENCES, THERE HAS BEEN UPDATES SHARED WITH THE COUNCIL 
20:08:22 BECAUSE I THINK MULTIPLE COUNCILMEMBERS HAVE PUT IN COMMENTS, AND THAT THERE 
20:08:29 HAVE BEEN SOME ACTIONS TAKEN, SO I WANTED TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND 
20:08:33 PUBLIC SAFETY IS IMPORTANT TO US, SO THAT ACTIONS HAVE BEEN INSTITUTED AND 
20:08:38 I KNOW THAT EACH CASE IS A DIFFERENT CASE, BUT I DO KNOW THAT WE'VE HAD 
20:08:42 OUTREACH AND WHEN IT COMES TO ENFORCEMENT, THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE 
20:08:46 ARE TRYING TO STRIVE MORE ON IN TERMS OF THE RESTRICTIONS THAT WE JUST 
20:08:51 TALKED ABOUT EARLIER IN TERMS OF SOME OF THE COUNTY'S DECISIONS AND JUDICIAL 
20:08:55 SYSTEMS SOMETIMES HAVE LIMITED US AND RESTRICTED OUR ABILITIES AS A LOCAL 
20:08:59 JURISDICTION TO HAVE SOME OF THESE FLEXIBILITIES IN OUR ABILITY TO HAVE 
20:09:04 ENFORCEMENT FOR DIFFERENT REASONS, AND THEN NOW WE'VE ALSO EXPANDED AND WE 
20:09:09 HAD TALKED ABOUT IN THE PAST HAVING PARKING ENFORCEMENT, SO THIS IS NOT 
20:09:13 SOMETHING ENTIRELY NEW THAT WE HAVE ALREADY IMPLEMENTED, BUT AS WE ROLL 
20:09:17 THAT OUT, WE WOULD DEFINITELY ISSUE MORE COMMUNICATIONS TO THE PUBLIC.
20:09:19 
AGAIN AS A REMINDER, BECAUSE THOSE ARE 
20:09:25 THINGS THAT ARE SIGNED AND NOTICED OUT THERE, BUT IT'S JUST THE FACT OF 
20:09:28 ENFORCEMENT, I GUESS IS THE QUESTION THAT IT SOUNDS LIKE WE'RE HEARING.
20:09:29 
COUNCILMEMBER COX.
20:09:30 
>> Councilmember Cox: YES, I WOULD 
20:09:38 JUST LIKE TO FIND OUT, IN TERMS OF THESE NEW CHANGES THAT ARE NOTED IN 
20:09:44 THE RED AS THE PROPOSED NEW CHANGES BEFORE US, THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT 
20:09:51 WAS REGULATORY BASED ON OTHER LAWS THAT ARE BEING ENFORCED THAT WE'RE ALIGNING 
20:09:57 OURSELVES WITH THESE FINES AND PENALTIES.
20:09:59 
I'M JUST TRYING TO FIND OUT A LITTLE 
20:10:00 BIT OF SOME BACKGROUND.
20:10:03 
BECAUSE SOME THINGS APPEAR TO BE 
20:10:10 ADA-RELATED, AND OTHER THINGS, I'M NOT SURE WHERE IS THE SOURCE OF WHY NOW 
20:10:14 CHANGING AND UPGRADING SOME OF THESE PENALTIES.
20:10:16 
I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT 
20:10:24 TRIGGERED IT, AND WHAT WAS THE SOURCE OF REFERENCE THAT MADE THIS HAPPEN.
20:10:26 
WITH THESE NEW CHANGES.
20:10:30 
>> CAPTAIN WASHINGTON:  SURE, 
20:10:34 COUNCILMEMBER COX, I'M ACTUALLY GOING TO DEFER TO OUR BUSINESS MANAGER, 
20:10:40 DEIRDRE ROCKEFELLER-RAMSEY, WHO DID ALL OF THE RESEARCH FOR US, AND ACTUALLY 
20:10:45 HELPED DEVELOP OUR PLAN TO BRING US UP TO SPEED AND GET US IN COMPLIANCE WITH 
20:10:49 THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE LAW THAT WE ALIGN OURSELVES WITH OTHER CITIES 
20:10:50 THROUGHOUT THE COUNTY.
20:10:54 
SO I'LL DEFER TO DEIRDRE TO GIVE SOME 
20:10:55 BACKGROUND ON IT.
20:10:59 
>> HI, COUNCILMEMBERS.
20:11:01 
SO THERE IS A GOVERNMENT CODE THAT 
20:11:07 DICTATES, AS FAR AS PARKING REGULATIONS, THAT THEY SHOULD BE 
20:11:11 SOMEWHAT IN ALIGNMENT WITHIN CITIES WITHIN THE SAME COUNTY, AND SO I 
20:11:16 REACHED OUT TO A LOT OF DIFFERENT AGENCIES WITHIN THE COUNTY TO FIND OUT 
20:11:23 WHAT THEIR PRICES WERE FOR A LOT OF THE PARKING AND THE CALIFORNIA CODE 
20:11:26 PENALTIES IN THEIR CITY, AND THEN COMPARED THEM WITH OURS, WHICH HADN'T 
20:11:34 BEEN RAISED SINCE 1999 OUTSIDE OF A $3 MANDATED STATE FEE IN 2013.
20:11:36 
AND SO THEY WERE FAIRLY LOW IN 
20:11:40 COMPARISON TO OUR SURROUNDING CITIES IN THE COUNTY.
20:11:43 
AND SO IT WAS -- IT JUST SEEMED LIKE A 
20:11:48 GOOD TIME, KNOWING THAT WE ALSO WANTED TO INCREASE THE NOISE ORDINANCE, 
20:11:53 BECAUSE WHEN IT WENT TO COUNCIL WHEN IT WAS REVISED BACK IN APRIL, THEY DIDN'T 
20:11:58 RAISE THE FEE THEN, SO KNOWING THAT WE WERE GOING TO ALREADY REVISE ONE OF 
20:12:03 THEM, WE TOOK A LOOK AT SOME OF THE OTHER ONES THAT WERE ON THE CIVIL 
20:12:05 PENALTY SCHEDULE THAT WE THOUGHT WERE OUT OF DATE.
20:12:08 
AND THEN TO WORK WITH -- TO GO ALONG 
20:12:11 WITH ENFORCEMENT WITH THE NEW PARKING COMPLIANCE PROGRAM AS WELL.
20:12:17 
>> Councilmember Cox: IS THERE A 
20:12:23 REASON WHY YOU WANT TO DO IT NOW AS OPPOSED TO, LIKE, JANUARY 1, 2022?
20:12:23 
WHY NOW?
20:12:28 
>> IT JUST SEEMED -- IT'S THE NEW 
20:12:30 FISCAL YEAR, SO IT JUST SEEMED TO GO IN ALIGNMENT.
20:12:32 
WE ALSO JUST EXECUTED THE CONTRACT 
20:12:37 WITH DATA TICKET, WHO DOES -- WHO PROCESSES ALL OF THE CITATIONS, AND SO 
20:12:43 I HAD TO DO A LOT OF OVERHAUL AS FAR AS THE CONTRACT AND SETTING UP THINGS IN 
20:12:46 THE SOFTWARE AND IT JUST ALL KIND OF WENT TOGETHER.
20:12:53 
>> Councilmember Cox: AND DATA TICKET 
20:12:55 IS NOW STARTING AS OF JANUARY 1?
20:12:58 
IS THAT WHEN THE CONTRACT STARTED WITH 
20:12:58 DATA TICKET?
20:13:02 
>> NO, THE NEW CONTRACT WAS EXECUTED 
20:13:03 AS OF JULY 1ST.
20:13:04 
>> Councilmember Cox: JULY 1ST?
20:13:06 
>> YEAH, THE FISCAL YEAR.
20:13:07 
>> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.
20:13:14 
AND HOW MUCH IS THE DELTA ON THESE 
20:13:14 INCREASES?
20:13:17 
I JUST SEE THE NUMBERS, BUT I DON'T 
20:13:26 SEE, LIKE, WHAT'S THE PERCENTAGE INCREASE AND UNDERSTANDING IS THIS A 
20:13:28 3%, 5%, 20%?
20:13:29 
>> THEY VARY.
20:13:31 
SO THERE IS A GOVERNMENT CODE THAT 
20:13:35 TELLS YOU THAT ANYTHING RELATED TO HANDICAPPED PARKING HAS TO HAVE A 
20:13:42 MINIMUM OF AT LEAST $250 OR $275, DEPENDING ON WHICH CODE IT IS.
20:13:44 
SO THOSE WERE BROUGHT UP OH MATCH 
20:13:50 SEVERAL OF THE OTHER NEIGHBORING CITIES AFTER 3/11.
20:13:53 
AND BEFORE ALL THE CALIFORNIA VEHICLE 
20:14:01 CODES AND BASIC PARKING CITATIONS WERE $63, WE'RE JUST BRINGING THEM UP TO 
20:14:04 $75 FOR THE MOST PART, FOR THE MAJORITY OF THEM.
20:14:05 
>> Councilmember Cox: WHAT OTHER 
20:14:10 NEARBY CITIES WERE YOU REFERRING TO FOR HANDICAPPED PARKING, WHAT OTHER CITIES 
20:14:12 WERE WE REALIGNING OURSELVES WITH?
20:14:15 
>> UNION CITY IS AT 3.
20:14:16 11, NEWARK IS AT 3.
20:14:18 10, HAYWARD IS AT 3.40.
20:14:30 
>> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.
20:14:36 
>> Mayor Mei: COUNCILMEMBER COX, ARE 
20:14:37 YOU FINISHED WITH YOUR QUESTIONS?
20:14:39 
I SEE WE HAVE A HAND RAISED.
20:14:41 
>> Councilmember Cox: I ALSO WANTED TO 
20:14:45 FIND OUT ABOUT THE PARKING PERMIT REQUIRED DURING RESTRICTED.
20:14:47 
I DON'T ENTIRELY UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT 
20:14:47 ONE MEANS.
20:14:52 
>> I WOULD HAVE TO LOOK UP THAT CODE 
20:14:52 REAL FAST.
20:14:59 
I DIDN'T MODIFY THE NAMES THAT WERE ON 
20:14:59 HERE ALREADY.
20:15:01 
I JUST BASICALLY CHANGED THE PRICES.
20:15:05 
SO I CAN LOOK THAT UP.
20:15:26 
SO BASICALLY IT'S A VIOLATION OF 
20:15:32 PARKING A VEHICLE ON A STREET IN A PERMIT PARKING AREA DURING RESTRICTED TIMES.
20:15:38 
IS THE FMC THAT IT'S RELATED TO.
20:15:40 
>> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.
20:15:41 
AND WITH ALL OF THIS, THESE ARE 
20:15:47 BASICALLY THE CHANGES IN CHAPTER 10 IS WHAT IS BEING PROPOSED TONIGHT, 
20:15:48 BASICALLY.
20:15:49 
WAS THERE OTHER CHANGES?
20:15:51 
>> THE NOISE ORDINANCE.
20:15:52 
>> Councilmember Cox: AND THE NOISE 
20:15:52 ORDINANCE.
20:15:56 
>> AND THEN THE CDCs, WHICH GO ALONG 
20:15:56 WITH PARKING.
20:15:58 
THEY'RE ALL CONSIDERED LIKE EQUIPMENT 
20:16:00 OR PARKING RELATED.
20:16:02 
>> Councilmember Cox: RIGHT, RIGHT, ON 
20:16:05 THE SIDEWALK AND ALL THE OTHER ONES, DOUBLE PARKING.
20:16:07 
THINGS LIKE THAT.
20:16:10 
SO YOU'RE TRYING TO ALIGN IT WITH 
20:16:16 CUTTING INTO THIS COMING YEAR FOR --
>> FISCAL YEAR, YES.
20:16:17 
>> Councilmember Cox: HOW MUCH REVENUE 
20:16:20 IS GENERATED THROUGH ALL THESE PENALTIES?
20:16:24 
>> CITYWIDE OR JUST THESE?
20:16:26 
>> Councilmember Cox: CITYWIDE FOR 
20:16:27 IMPLEMENTING ALL OF THIS.
20:16:35 
>> WELL, I HAVE NET REVENUE AMOUNTS 
20:16:36 THAT I CAN LOOK UP REAL FAST.
20:16:40 
BECAUSE ANYTHING THAT IS OWED THAT YOU 
20:16:43 HAVE TO PAY TO THE COUNTY, SO THERE'S FEES THAT YOU HAVE TO PAY TO THE 
20:16:49 COUNTY ON PARKING PENALTIES, JUST LIKE IF YOU WERE TO GET A MOVING VIOLATION, 
20:16:52 YOU HAVE TO GO TO THE COURT, THEY'RE GOING TO TAKE LITTLE BITS OF YOUR FINE 
20:16:55 AND PUT TO DIFFERENT SPECIAL FUNDS, YOU HAVE TO DO THE SAME THING TO THE 
20:17:00 COUNTY FOR PARKING PENALTIES THAT ARE COLLECTED AS CIVIL PENALTIES, SO WE 
20:17:08 HAVE TO PAY A LOT OF THOSE OUT, AND THEN WE PAYDAY TA TICKET TO PROCESS 
20:17:10 ALL THE FMC VIOLATIONS ACROSS THE CITY.
20:17:11 
SO LET ME PULL THAT UP.
20:17:28 
SO LAST YEAR, THE NET REVENUE WAS $660,000.
20:17:33 
IN FISCAL YEAR 19/20.
20:17:36 
AND THEN IT DROPPED DUE TO COVIT, SO 
20:17:40 COVID WAS $400,000.
20:17:40 
RIGHT NOW.
20:17:41 
IT'S NOT QUITE CLOSED YET.
20:17:46 
THERE'S STILL ANOTHER MONTH THAT NEEDS 
20:17:47 TO BE PUT IN THERE.
20:17:48 
>> Councilmember Cox: THOSE ARE ALL 
20:17:49 FEES COLLECTED IN THAT TIME?
20:17:51 
BECAUSE THERE COULD BE STILL COMING 
20:17:52 IN, RIGHT?
20:17:55 
IT'S JUST THE END OF THE -- JUNE 30TH.
20:17:57 
>> 2021 IS NOT QUITE FINISHED YET, 
20:18:00 BECAUSE JUNE IS STILL IN THE MIDDLE OF BEING PROCESSED.
20:18:06 
BUT IF YOU LOOK AT FISCAL YEAR 19/20, 
20:18:10 WHICH IS FULLY CLOSED, IT WAS $660,000.
20:18:11 
>> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.
20:18:13 
IS THIS PUBLISHED OP OUR WEBSITE 
20:18:16 ANYWHERE AT ALL TO COMMUNICATE TO OUR RESIDENTS THAT THESE CHANGES, IF 
20:18:20 PASSED TONIGHT, WOULD -- THEY WOULD BE AWARE OF THIS?
20:18:22 
>> I BELIEVE THIS WAS MADE PUBLIC 
20:18:24 NOTICE BEFORE THE COUNCIL HEARING.
20:18:27 
>> Councilmember Cox: JUST THE PUBLIC 
20:18:32 MEETING, BUT IS YOUR INTENT THEN, HOW WOULD YOU COMMUNICATE THAT IF IT'S 
20:18:34 PASSED TO THE RESIDENTS?
20:18:37 
>> WHATEVER WAY WE NORMALLY 
20:18:40 COMMUNICATE THE CHANGES IN THE CIVIL PENALTY SCHEDULE, WE WOULD DO THE SAME 
20:18:41 FOR THESE.
20:18:44 
>> Councilmember Cox: AND I'M SORRY, 
20:18:48 MARK, IS THERE A WAY YOU COULD HELP ME TO UNDERSTAND HOW IS THIS COMMUNICATED 
20:18:52 TO THE PUBLIC AFTER IF SOMETHING LIKE THIS PASSES?
20:18:54 
JUST SO I CAN UNDERSTAND THE PROCESS?
20:18:57 
>> City Manager Danaj: WE TYPICALLY 
20:19:01 WILL SHARE AGENDA  ITEMS OR ACTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN TAKEN AT COUNCIL 
20:19:05 MEETINGS THROUGH OUR SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS, THROUGH OUR WEEKLY 
20:19:10 NEWSLETTER, THROUGH OUR QUARTERLY NEWSLETTER THAT'S MAILED TO EVERY HOME.
20:19:13 
SO IT WOULD BE ANY ONE IF NOT ALL OF THOSE.
20:19:18 
>> Councilmember Cox: BECAUSE IF IT 
20:19:22 PASSES, I REALLY WOULD LIKE TO MAKE SURE THAT IT COMMUNICATED AND 
20:19:27 COMMUNICATED MORE THAN ONCE IN ALL THOSE DIFFERENT CHANNELS JUST SO 
20:19:30 PEOPLE ARE AWARE OF THAT.
20:19:32 
>> City Manager Danaj: THAT'S WHAT 
20:19:33 THOSE MEDIUMS ARE FOR.
20:19:34 
ABSOLUTELY.
20:19:35 
>> Ms.
20:19:38  Shackelford: AND COUNCILMEMBER COX, AND PRIOR TO THIS, I JUST WANT TO 
20:19:42 OFFER THAT THIS WAS NOTICED AS A -- AS A PUBLIC HEARING, SO THAT'S YET 
20:19:49 ANOTHER WAY WE DO IT  PROACTIVELY, IN ADDITION TO ALL OF THE WAYS THAT MARK 
20:19:51 JUST MENTIONED, ONCE YOU ALL TAKE YOUR VOTE.
20:19:54 
>> Councilmember Cox: SO THE PUBLIC 
20:19:58 MEETING, THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN -- ALREADY HAPPENED BY NOW, RIGHT?
20:20:01 
WE'VE ALREADY VOTED ON THIS, RIGHT?
20:20:01 
>> Ms.
20:20:02  Shackelford: RIGHT.
20:20:04 
IT'S NOTICED WELL IN ADVANCE OF THE 
20:20:10 AGENDA BEING PUBLISHED, AS THIS BEING A PUBLIC HEARING, SO THAT OUR COMMUNITY 
20:20:14 IS AWARE THAT THIS ITEM IS COMING BEFORE THE COUNCIL FOR CONSIDERATION.
20:20:17 
>> City Manager Danaj: SO THIS IS THE 
20:20:21 PUBLIC HEARING, BUT IT REQUIRES ADDITIONAL NOTIFICATION BEYOND A 
20:20:24 REGULAR AGENDA ITEM, IS WHAT WE'RE SAYING.
20:20:25 
AND THAT DID HAPPEN.
20:20:29 
>> Councilmember Cox: AND THAT DID 
20:20:29 HAPPEN?
20:20:29 
OKAY.
20:20:31 
THANK YOU.
20:20:37 
>> Mayor Mei: COUNCILMEMBER  KENG, 
20:20:38 CLARIFYING QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS.
20:20:41 
>> Councilmember Keng: THANK YOU, 
20:20:42 MADAME MAYOR.
20:20:46 
SO IF WE DO PASS THIS, WHAT'S THE 
20:20:53 TIMELINE OF THIS BEING IMPLEMENTED AND ENFORCED AND ALSO EARLIER WE TALKED 
20:21:02 ABOUT NOTIFYING THE BUSINESS OWNERS SO THEY CAN MAKE AWARE TO THEIR CUSTOMERS 
20:21:05 , AND WHAT MIGHT BE THE TIMELINE FOR THAT?
20:21:08 
>> SO IT CAN HAPPEN FAIRLY QUICKLY.
20:21:11 
YOU HAVE TO GET THE PRICES OVER TO 
20:21:18 DATA TICKET AND THEY HAVE TO UPLOAD IT INTO THEIR DATABASE SO THAT THE NEW 
20:21:21 PRICES ARE REFLECTED IN THE SYSTEM WHEN CITATIONS ARE ISSUED.
20:21:24 
AND THEN WE WOULD HAVE TO TRAIN THE 
20:21:24 DEPARTMENT.
20:21:27 
SO IT SHOULDN'T TAKE EXTREMELY LONG TO 
20:21:31 DO THAT, BUT IF THERE'S ANYTHING THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO DO PRIOR AS A CITY 
20:21:34 FOR FURTHER NOTIFICATION, WE CAN CERTAINLY DO THAT AND I CAN ALIGN ALL 
20:21:36 OF THAT WITH THAT NOTIFICATION.
20:21:40 
>> Councilmember Keng: THANK YOU.
20:21:43 
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE MAKE 
20:21:49 SURE THAT THE NOTIFICATIONS ARE OUT AND ALLOW A LITTLE BIT OF TIME BEFORE 
20:21:50 ENFORCING IT.
20:21:51 
THANK YOU.
20:21:53 
>> Mayor Mei: COUNCILMEMBER JONES, 
20:21:54 CLARIFYING QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS?
20:21:55 
>> Councilmember Jones: NO, I'M READY 
20:21:57 TO MAKE A MOTION.
20:21:57 
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY.
20:22:00 
I SEE COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, YOU ALSO 
20:22:03 HAVE -- DO YOU HAVE YOUR HAND RAISED FOR A COMMENT AT THIS TIME?
20:22:04 
>> Councilmember Kassan: YEAH.
20:22:06 
I'M JUST WONDERING IF THERE WOULD BE 
20:22:11 ANY OPENNESS TO POSSIBLY INCREASING THE ONES FOR THE NOISE.
20:22:23 
YOU KNOW, I THINK IT'S A REALLY BIG 
20:22:26 ISSUE FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE, AND I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S REALLY -- 
20:22:32 HAS A MEANINGFUL DETERRENT EFFECT, BUT IF THERE ISN'T A LOT OF SUPPORT FOR 
20:22:34 THAT, I'LL JUST -- I'LL GO WITH WHAT'S BEEN PROPOSED.
20:22:42 
>> Mayor Mei: I BELIEVE AS IT'S 
20:22:49 PROPOSED, IT'S -- LET ME LOOK AT IT -- IT'S 200 -- 500 AND THE MAX IS A 
20:22:51 THOUSAND.
20:22:54 
>> IT'S 100, 200, 500 IS WHAT I HAD 
20:22:59 RAISED TO, WHICH WAS THE STANDARD FEE FOR MOST CIVIL PENALTIES WITHOUT 
20:22:59 EXCEPTION.
20:23:05 
BUT I BELIEVE THERE IS A HIGHER MAX 
20:23:09 WITHIN THE FREMONT MUNICIPAL CODE THAT IT COULD BE RAISED TO.
20:23:11 
>> Mayor Mei: WHAT IS THAT MAXIMUM, 
20:23:12 MAY I ASK, MS.
20:23:14  RAMSEY?
20:23:29 
>> 1,000.
20:23:30 
>> Mayor Mei: THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.
20:23:31 
I THINK THAT'S THE MAX.
20:23:33 
BUT IS THERE ANY INTEREST FROM THE 
20:23:34 COUNCIL TO RAISE TO A THOUSAND?
20:23:37 
>> Councilmember Kassan: I MEAN, MAYBE 
20:23:42 I COULD JUST MAKE A MOTION SO WE DON'T HAVE TO JUST KIND OF GUESS, OR LIKE A 
20:23:47 PROPOSED AMENDMENT TO THE MOTION, WHICH WOULD BE TO MAYBE INCREASE -- MAYBE WE 
20:23:52 KEEP THE THIRD VIOLATION THE SAME AT 500 BUT MAYBE INCREASE THE FIRST 
20:23:55 VIOLATION TO 200 AND THE SECOND VIOLATION TO 300.
20:23:59 
SO INSTEAD OF 100, 200, 500, IT WOULD 
20:24:00 BE 200, 300, 500.
20:24:05 
>> Mayor Mei: AND TO CLARIFY, YOU'RE 
20:24:07 SAYING SOLELY FOR THAT ITEM REGARDING NOISE?
20:24:10 
>> Councilmember Kassan: UH-HUH.
20:24:11 
>> Mayor Mei: NOT ANY OTHER CHANGES.
20:24:14 
WE HAVE A MOTION ON THE TABLE.
20:24:15 
DO WE HAVE A SECOND?
20:24:18 
I'D LIKE TO CALL THE VOTE.
20:24:20 
>> Councilmember Jones: QUICK QUESTION.
20:24:20 
MS.
20:24:24  MARGOLIS, DO WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO THAT WITHOUT PRIOR NOTICE?
20:24:26 
MS.
20:24:36  MARGOLIS THAT'S KIND OF A TRICKY QUESTION BECAUSE THIS ITEM ACTUALLY 
20:24:38 ISN'T REQUIRED TO HAVE A PUBLIC HEARING NOTICE BUT IT DID GET ONE.
20:24:43 
BUT WHAT I WAS MORE CONCERNED ABOUT, 
20:24:46 DEIRDRE, MAYBE YOU HAVE THE ANSWER ALREADY, I'M TRYING TO GET THE CODE UP 
20:24:50 HERE, BUT THE MAXIMUM SHE STATED WAS A THOUSAND, BUT I'M NOT SURE IF THERE 
20:24:52 WAS A MAXIMUM ON THE FIRST AND SECOND VIOLATION.
20:24:59 
>> I'M LOOKING AT 1.15.
20:25:06 020, AND NO, IT'S A, ANY PERSON CONVICTED OF THE MISDEMEANOR UNDER THE 
20:25:10 PROVISIONS OF THIS CODE SHALL BE PUNISHABLE BY A FINE OF NOT MORE THAN $1,000.
20:25:14 
SO IT DOES NOT DICTATE THE THREE 
20:25:19 DIFFERENT CITATION LEVEL AMOUNTS SINCE THIS IS NOT -- TITLE 15 DOES, BUT THIS 
20:25:20 IS NOT PART OF TITLE 15.
20:25:23 
>> Councilmember Cox: HOW DOES THAT 
20:25:25 NOISE PENALTIES COMPARE TO OTHER CITIES?
20:25:29 
>> I DID NOT LOOK AT NOISE IN 
20:25:31 COMPARISON TO OTHER CITIES.
20:25:31 
MS.
20:25:34  MARGOLIS THAT WAS GOING TO BE MY OTHER COMMENT, IS I WOULD HAVE SOME CONCERNS 
20:25:38 ABOUT JUST RAISING IT WITHOUT LOOKING AT HOW IT COMPARES TO OTHER CITIES.
20:25:43 
IT MAY BE PRUDENT TO LEAVE IT AS IT IS 
20:25:47 RIGHT NOW AND LOOK AT AMENDING IT DOWN THE ROAD IF WE FEEL IT'S NOT 
20:25:47 SUFFICIENT.
20:25:51 
>> City Manager Danaj: BUT DOES THIS 
20:25:52 REQUIRE A SECOND READING?
20:25:52 
MS.
20:25:53  MARGOLIS NO, IT DOES NOT.
20:25:56 
THIS IS NOT AN ORDINANCE.
20:25:58 
>> City Manager Danaj: OKAY.
20:25:59 
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY.
20:26:06 
IS THERE A SECOND TO THE MOTION ON THE 
20:26:06 TABLE?
20:26:07 
>> Councilmember Jones: SECOND.
20:26:08 
>> Mayor Mei: COUNCILMEMBER JONES.
20:26:09 
>> Councilmember Kassan: CAN I ASK, IS 
20:26:11 THE MOTION WITH MY AMENDMENT OR WITHOUT IT?
20:26:12 
I'M SORRY, I'M CONFUSED.
20:26:12 
MS.
20:26:13  MARGOLIS I WAS ON MUTE.
20:26:16 
RIGHT NOW THERE'S AN AMENDMENT THAT 
20:26:21 WAS OFFERED, IF THAT ONE IS NOT ACCEPTED BY THE MAKER OF THE MOTION, 
20:26:21 THEN IT DIES.
20:26:25 
>> Mayor Mei: ARE YOU ACCEPTING, 
20:26:29 COUNCILMEMBER JONES, ARE YOU ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENT FOR THE CHANGE ON NOISE?
20:26:32 
>> Councilmember Jones: I'M GOING TO 
20:26:35 DEFER TO THE CITY ATTORNEY'S ADVICE ON THAT AND KEEP IT AS IT IS, AND WE CAN 
20:26:37 ALWAYS LOOK AT THAT IN THE FUTURE.
20:26:39 
I WOULD BE RELUCTANT UNTIL WE GET THAT 
20:26:40 INFORMATION BACK AND MS.
20:26:44  RAMSEY CAN PROVIDE THAT, MAYBE AT THE STAFF BRIEFING LEVEL, AND WE CAN 
20:26:46 ADDRESS THAT AT A FUTURE DATE.
20:26:48 
I KNOW THAT NOISE COMPLAINTS 
20:26:54 HISTORICALLY HAVE BEEN AN ISSUE FOR THE POLICE DEPARTMENT, SO I'M GLAD TO SEE 
20:27:00 THAT WE HAVE THIS ONE IN PLACE, BUT I AM KIND OF RELUCTANT TO WIELD A BIG 
20:27:00 STICK RIGHT OFF THE BAT.
20:27:03 
SO AGAIN, I'LL DEFER TO CITY ATTORNEY 
20:27:09 MARGOLIS' RECOMMENDATION THAT WE MOVE IT FORWARD AS IS AND ADDRESS IT AT A 
20:27:10 FUTURE DATE IF WE DEEM IT NECESSARY.
20:27:13 
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY.
20:27:17 
SO WE'RE NOT ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENT.
20:27:21 
DO WE HAVE A SECOND FOR THE ORIGINAL 
20:27:23 -- I GUESS THE MOTION AS IT WAS MADE?
20:27:25 
SECONDED BY VICE MAYOR SHAO.
20:27:30 
SO AT THIS TIME, ROLL CALL VOTE, 
20:27:30 PLEASE, ON THIS.
20:27:33 
>> Mr.
20:27:34  Quintanilla:COUNCILMEMBE R COX, AYE.
20:27:37 
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN, AYE.
20:27:39 
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, AYE.
20:27:42 
COUNCILMEMBER JONES, AYE.
20:27:45 
COUNCILMEMBER KENG, AYE.
20:27:48 
VICE MAYOR SHAO, AYE.
20:27:50 
MAYOR MEI, AYE.
20:27:52 
>> Mayor Mei: SO THE MOTION PASSES AS 
20:27:57 IT STANDS, BUT I WOULD LIKE TO ASK FOR STAFF, MS.
20:27:57  MS.
20:28:01  DEIRDRE RAMSEY, IF YOU COULD HELP US LOOK INTO THAT SO WE CAN UNDERSTAND 
20:28:04 OUR FLEXIBILITY IN TERMS OF LATITUDE, AND ALSO TO ECHO THE SENTIMENTS, WHICH 
20:28:11 IS THAT WE WILL BE REACHING OUT TO ASK FOR MORE PUBLIC NOTICE ONCE THIS IS 
20:28:12 PASSED IN NOTIFYING PEOPLE.
20:28:14 
I WILL NOTE REAL QUICKLY, BECAUSE OF 
20:28:20 THE TIMING, WE ARE DUE FOR A BREAK WITH OUR STENOCAPTIONER, AND I KNOW THAT 
20:28:23 THIS WILL NOT BE A TWO-MINUTE DISCUSSION FOR THE NEXT AGENDA ITEM.
20:28:25 
SO AT THIS TIME, I'M GOING TO PAUSE 
20:28:28 FOR A 10-MINUTE BREAK AND RETURN AT 8:40.
20:28:31 
I'D LIKE TO ASK FOR ALL OF US TO 
20:28:36 PLEASE MAKE SURE TO MUTE YOUR MICS AND TURN OFF YOUR VIDEO WHILE WE'RE ON 
20:28:37 THIS BREAK AND WE'LL RETURN IN 10 MINUTES.
20:28:38 
THANK YOU.
20:28:47 
[RECESS]

20:39:59 >> Mayor Mei: GOOD EVENING.
20:40:00 
I'D LIKE TO CALL THE MEETING BACK TO 
20:40:00 ORDER.
20:40:02 
ONCE I SEE ALL OF OUR COUNCILMEMBERS 
20:40:03 RETURN.
20:40:16 
WE WILL BE RETURNING TO ITEM 7A.
20:40:19 
WHICH IS THE SAFE PARKING PROGRAM.
20:40:21 
I'LL GIVE ANOTHER MINUTE.
20:40:27 
WE'RE WAITING FOR TWO COUNCILMEMBERS.
20:40:39 
GREAT.
20:40:43 
AND ALBERTO, I'LL WAIT FOR OUR CLERK.
20:40:47 
THERE.
20:40:52 
AND OUR CITY MANAGER, HOPEFULLY, MARK 
20:40:52 DANAJ.
20:40:54 
AND OUR CITY ATTORNEY.
20:41:01 
>> City Manager Danaj: I'M HERE, MAYOR.
20:41:01 
>> Mayor Mei: GREAT.
20:41:02 
THANK YOU.
20:41:03 
WELCOME BACK.
20:41:04 
THANK YOU TO ALL THOSE WHO HAVE STAYED 
20:41:05 WITH US THIS EVENING.
20:41:07 
THE NEXT ITEM ON OUR AGENDA THIS 
20:41:11 EVENING IS ITEM 7A, WHICH IS THE SAFE PARKING PROGRAM.
20:41:15 
AND TONIGHT WE HAVE HUMAN SERVICES 
20:41:19 DIRECTOR SUZANNE SHENFIL, WHO WILL BE HERE TO PROVIDE AN INTRODUCTION AND A 
20:41:20 PRESENTATION ON THIS AGENDA ITEM.
20:41:23 
THANK YOU.
20:41:25 
WE'LL BEGIN WITH THAT.
20:41:25 
>> Ms.
20:41:27  Shenfil: GOOD EVENING, MAYOR AND COUNCILMEMBERS.
20:41:30 
I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE LAURIE FLORES, 
20:41:36 WHO IS OUR HOMELESS SERVICES MANAGER, AND SHE WILL BE SHARING IN THE 
20:41:38 PRESENTATION WITH ME, AND SHE'S GOING TO START OFF THIS EVENING.
20:41:43 
>> Mayor Mei: WELCOME, LAURIE.
20:41:44 
GOOD EVENING.
20:41:45 
>> THANK YOU.
20:41:47 
GOOD EVENING, MADAME MAYOR AND 
20:41:49 HONORABLE COUNCILMEMBERS.
20:41:52 
WE'RE RETURNING TO YOU TONIGHT WITH A 
20:41:56 PRESENTATION ON THE DRAFT SAFE PARKING PROGRAM ELEMENTS AS DIRECTED AT THE 
20:41:58 JUNE 1ST COUNCIL MEETING.
20:42:01 
WE DO HAVE SOME SLIDES.
20:42:08   AVAILABLE.
20:42:17 
>> Mayor Mei: WILL YOU BE SHARING THE 
20:42:18 SCREEN?
20:42:19 
>> OH, I CAN.
20:42:19 
SORRY.
20:42:20 
I THOUGHT IT WAS --

20:42:23 >> Mayor Mei: I DON'T SEE THEM AT THIS TIME.
20:42:26 
>> LET ME FIND THEM.
20:42:29 
>> Mayor Mei: OR ALBERTO, IF YOU HAVE 
20:42:30 THEM TOO, EITHER WAY IS FINE.
20:42:34 
>> Mr.
20:42:36  Quintanilla: I CAN PULL THEM UP.
20:42:36 
I CAN SHARE.
20:42:37 
>> I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT.
20:42:39 
>> Mayor Mei: NO WORRIES.
20:42:41 
I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE ALL 
20:42:42 LOOKING AT THE PRESENTATION.
20:42:48 
>> ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU.
20:42:52 
OKAY.
20:42:55 
SO YES, AGAIN, WE'RE HERE WITH YOU 
20:42:59 TONIGHT TO PRESENT THE DRAFT PROGRAM ELEMENTS FOR SAFE PARKING IN FREMONT.
20:43:07 
WE JUST WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO 
20:43:11 RE-EMPHASIZE THAT SAFE PARKING IS A CRISIS RESPONSE TO VEHICULAR 
20:43:11 HOMELESSNESS.
20:43:13 
IT IS ONE TOOL TO ADDRESS THIS CRISIS 
20:43:15 IN OUR REGION.
20:43:17 
IN ALAMEDA COUNTY, FOR EVERY ONE 
20:43:21 INDIVIDUAL OR HOUSEHOLD TRANSITIONING INTO STABLE HOUSING, THREE OTHERS ARE 
20:43:22 BECOMING HOMELESS.
20:43:24 
HIGH COST OF RENT, LACK OF AFFORDABLE 
20:43:29 HOUSING, WAGE STAGNATION AND LACK OF LIVABLE WAGE JOBS HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO 
20:43:30 THIS CRISIS.
20:43:32 
THE NUMBER OF PERSONS SEEKING 
20:43:36 AFFORDABLE HOUSING SUBSTANTIALLY OUTWEIGHS PRODUCTION OF SUCH UNITS.
20:43:39 
CURRENT DATA AVAILABLE FROM THE 2019.
20:43:44  IN TIME COUNT SHOWS US THAT FREMONT HAD A 72% INCREASE IN UNSHELTERED 
20:43:45 HOMELESSNESS IN TWO YEARS.
20:43:48 
THIS INCLUDES PEOPLE LIVING OUTSIDE OR 
20:43:50 IN CONDITIONS NOT MEANT FOR HUMAN HABITATION.
20:43:54 
50% OF UNSHELTERED PEOPLE IN FREMONT 
20:43:55 LIVE IN VEHICLES.
20:43:56 
THERE'S GREAT SPECULATION AT THE 
20:44:00 NUMBER OF UNSHELTERED PEOPLE ON OUR STREETS HAS INCREASED AND WILL 
20:44:01 CONTINUE TO DO SO.
20:44:05 
IN 2018, FREMONT JOINED MANY BAY AREA 
20:44:07 CITIES IN DECLARING A SHELTER CRISIS.
20:44:09 
IT'S NOT ONLY AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF THE 
20:44:13 CHALLENGES WE FACE AS A SOCIETY, BUT IT ALSO PROVIDED A FRAMEWORK TO IMPLEMENT 
20:44:20 CREATIVE SHELTER AND INTERIM HOUSING PROGRAMS SUCH AS OUR HOUSING 
20:44:20 NAVIGATION CENTER.
20:44:22 
MORE RECENTLY THE ONSET OF THE 
20:44:25 COVID-19 PANDEMIC HAS SHOWN THE WORLD THAT THE ABILITY TO SHELTER PEOPLE IS 
20:44:29 A HEALTH MEASURE KEY TO PREVENTING THE SPREAD OF AN ILLNESS, FATAL TO OUR 
20:44:31 MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITY MEMBERS.
20:44:33 
AND IT WILL TAKE OUR COMMUNITY TO COME 
20:44:37 TOGETHER TO UNDERSTAND AND HELP RESOLVE THE PROBLEM WITH CREATIVE SOLUTIONS 
20:44:38 AND PARTNERSHIPS.
20:44:41 
COUNCIL'S ADOPTION OF THE SAFE PARKING 
20:44:44 HOST SITE ORDINANCE ON JUNE 15TH REAFFIRMED THE CITY'S COMMITMENT TO 
20:44:47 IMPLEMENTING TOOLS TO ADDRESS THE HOMELESSNESS CRISIS IN FREMONT.
20:44:50 
THE SAFE PARKING HOST SITE ORDINANCE 
20:44:55 ALLOWS FAITH-BASED AND PUBLIC HOST LOTS TO HOST PEOPLE IN THEIR LOTS FOR A 
20:44:56 MINIMUM OF 10 HOURS OVERNIGHT.
20:45:00 
SINCE FEBRUARY, STAFF HAVE MET WITH 
20:45:03 REPRESENTATIVES OF LOCAL FAITH COMMUNITIES TO SEEK INPUT AND PARTNER 
20:45:04 ON FUTURE PROGRAMS.
20:45:06 
THESE CONVERSATIONS BEGAN TO CENTER 
20:45:09 AROUND A ROTATIONAL  MODEL, WHERE MULTIPLE SITES COULD ACQUIRE A HOST 
20:45:12 SITE PERMIT AND SHARE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF HOSTING ON A MONTHLY 
20:45:13 BASIS.
20:45:15 
ALTHOUGH THE ORDINANCE ALLOWS FOR ONE 
20:45:21 SITE TO HOST 24 HOURS A DAY, FOR A YEAR, WE BELIEVE A ROTATIONAL MODEL IS 
20:45:23 MORE FEASIBLE FOR OUR FAITH PARTNERS.
20:45:29 
IN JUNE, COUNCIL DIRECTED STAFF TO 
20:45:32 RETURN WITH SAFE PARKING PROGRAM DESIGN ELEMENTS.
20:45:34 
SINCE JULY 8TH, STAFF MET ONE ON ONE 
20:45:39 WITH COUNCILMEMBERS TO SHARE DRAFT DESIGN ELEMENTS AND SEEK INPUT WHICH 
20:45:41 HAS BEEN INCORPORATED.
20:45:42 
DURING THIS PRESENTATION, WE WILL 
20:45:45 PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF CRITERIA REFERRAL AND THE SCREENING PROCESS FOR 
20:45:47 PROGRAM APPLICANTS.
20:45:49 
PARTICIPANT EXPECTATIONS, AND HOST 
20:45:51 SITE AGREEMENTS AND OPERATIONS.
20:45:55 
I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE HUMAN SERVICES 
20:45:57 DIRECTOR SUZANNE SHENFIL FOR THE NEXT PORTION OF THE PRESENTATION.
20:46:02 
>> Ms.
20:46:10  Shenfil: SO I AM GOING TO SPEND A LITTLE TIME GOING OVER CRITERIA FOR 
20:46:12 PARTICIPATION IN THE SAFE PARKING PROGRAM.
20:46:15 
THE FIRST CRITERIA IS REALLY AN 
20:46:17 AFFILIATION WITH THE TRI-CITY AREA THAT INCLUDES FREMONT, NEWARK AND UNION 
20:46:18 CITY.
20:46:22 
AN AFFILIATION MEANS THAT SOMEONE HAS 
20:46:27 PREVIOUSLY HAD HOUSING IN OUR AREA, THAT THEY'RE ENROLLED IN SCHOOL OR 
20:46:35 EMPLOYED IN THE TRI-CITIES, THAT THEY HAVE FAMILY TIES, THEY GREW UP IN OUR 
20:46:39 AREA OR THEY HAVE FAMILY MEMBERS WHO ARE IN THE AREA OFTEN TRYING TO 
20:46:41 SUPPORT THEM IN SOME WAY.
20:46:44 
OR THEY HAVE PHYSICAL OR MENTAL HEALTH 
20:46:51 SERVICES THAT THEY'RE RECEIVING IN OUR AREA AND THEIR PHYSICIANS, ET CETERA, 
20:46:53 ARE IN THE TRI-CITIES.
20:46:58 
THE SECOND ASPECT OF THE PROGRAM IN 
20:47:01 TERMS OF CRITERIA, AND THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT AND WE WANT TO EMPHASIZE 
20:47:07 THIS, IS THAT EVERY PARTICIPANT MUST REALLY SHOW MOTIVATION AND A 
20:47:12 WILLINGNESS TO ENGAGE WITH ANY SERVICE PROVIDER TO SEEK A MORE STABLE AND 
20:47:14 PERMANENT HOUSING SOLUTION.
20:47:22 
FOR THIS REASON, PARTICIPANTS WILL BE 
20:47:29 REFERRED BY PARTNER AGENCIES PROVIDING CASE MANAGEMENT AND/OR HOUSING 
20:47:29 NAVIGATION SERVICES.
20:47:33 
SO REFERRALS WILL COME FOR PARTNERS 
20:47:36 LIKE ABODE, BACS OR BAY AREA COMMUNITY HEALTH.
20:47:40 
WE CERTAINLY WILL TAKE REFERRALS FROM 
20:47:44 POLICE, OUR OWN HUMAN SERVICES DEPARTMENT, AND OTHER FIELD STAFF SUCH 
20:47:47 AS ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES OR CODE ENFORCEMENT.
20:47:52 
THE HOST SITES MAY ALSO MAKE 
20:47:56 REFERRALS, AND A PERSON MAY  SELF-REFER.
20:47:58 
IF THEY'RE NOT ATTACHED TO A SERVICE 
20:48:01 PROVIDER, WE WILL PROVIDE THAT LINKAGE SO THEY WILL HAVE ONE OR WE WILL 
20:48:06 CONNECT THEM WITH A CASE MANAGER IN THE HUMAN SERVICES DEPARTMENT.
20:48:10 
AND WE WILL BE ASKING THE  AGENCIES 
20:48:14 AND THE SERVICE PROVIDERS TO ACTUALLY WORK IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF TRANSITION 
20:48:21 PLANS FOR THE INDIVIDUALS IN THE PROGRAM WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF, AGAIN, 
20:48:25 ULTIMATELY MOVING THEM INTO MORE STABLE AND MORE PERMANENT HOUSING.
20:48:33 
WE ALSO HAVE A FLEXIBLE PRIORITIZATION 
20:48:36 LIST FOR  RECEIVING REFERRALS.
20:48:40 
AND WHILE EACH HOST SITE WILL ACTUALLY 
20:48:46 BE ABLE TO SELECT THE POPULATION THAT THEY WANT TO SERVE, BUT AS PART OF OUR 
20:48:52 PRIORITIZATION, WE REALLY FEEL OLDER ADULTS SHOULD BE NEAR THE TOP OF THE 
20:48:53 LIST.
20:48:55 
FREQUENTLY WE FIND OLDER ADULTS WHO 
20:49:02 ARE IN VEHICLES HAVE MORE SERIOUS CHRONIC HEALTH PROBLEMS, THEY'RE OFTEN 
20:49:04 FRAILER AND VERY VULNERABLE.
20:49:06 
THE SECOND PRIORITY WILL BE FAMILIES 
20:49:08 WITH MINOR CHILDREN.
20:49:12 
AGAIN THE HOST SITE WILL DECIDE 
20:49:15 WHETHER OR NOT THEY WILL ACCEPT FAMILIES WITH MINOR CHILDREN, AND IF 
20:49:21 THERE ARE CHILDREN ON THE SITE, THEN MEGAN'S LAW WILL COME INTO PLAY AND WE 
20:49:27 WILL REQUIRE ALL PARTICIPANTS TO BE SCREENED WITH USING MEGAN'S LAW.
20:49:33  A MEGAN'S LAW SEARCH.
20:49:36 
ANOTHER PRIORITY AREA WILL BE FOR 
20:49:39 THOSE WHO ARE EMPLOYED, THEY'RE WORKING, OFTEN TRYING TO SAVE UP 
20:49:43 ENOUGH TO GET BACK INTO PERMANENT HOUSING OR PEOPLE WHO ARE ENROLLED IN 
20:49:44 SCHOOL.
20:49:47 
AND THEN LASTLY, AND WE REALLY FEEL 
20:49:54 THIS WILL BE THE PREPONDERANCE OF OUR POPULATION WILL BE ADULTS 18 AND OLDER 
20:49:59 WHO ARE SINGLE OR ARE IN A COUPLE RELATIONSHIP.
20:50:12 
IN TERMS OF SCREENING, WE TRIED VERY 
20:50:15 HARD TO LISTEN TO WHAT SOME OF THE CONCERNS WERE OF COUNCIL ON JUNE 15TH, 
20:50:22 WHEN WE ADOPTED THE ORDINANCE, AND SO OUR  SCREENING CRITERIA, I BELIEVE, 
20:50:24 REFLECT SOME OF YOUR CONCERNS.
20:50:28 
PARTICIPANTS MUST HAVE A VALID 
20:50:29 CALIFORNIA DRIVER'S LICENSE.
20:50:33 
THEY MUST HAVE CURRENT INSURANCE AND 
20:50:39 REGISTRATION OR WE'RE SUGGESTING ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS, WE COULD PROVIDE 
20:50:46 THEM A 45-DAY GRACE PERIOD TO HELP THE PARTICIPANT GET THEIR REGISTRATION AND 
20:50:47 INSURANCE REINSTATED.
20:50:51 
WE FIND OFTEN THAT PEOPLE HAVE LET 
20:50:57 THESE ITEMS LAPSE BECAUSE THEY HAVE LIMITED INCOME AND NEED TO PAY FOR 
20:51:00 OTHER MORE BASIC EXPENSES.
20:51:02 
WE ARE REALLY HOPING TO CREATE A 
20:51:08 COMMUNITY FUND THAT WILL HELP HOMELESS PARTICIPANTS PAY FOR THESE COSTS, AS 
20:51:10 WELL AS REASONABLE COSTS OF CAR REPAIRS.
20:51:15 
THE NEXT CRITERIA OR SCREENING 
20:51:22 CRITERIA WILL BE THAT VEHICLES AT LEAST FOR THIS SAFE PARKING STRATEGY MUST BE 
20:51:29 OPERABLE AND MUST BE ABLE TO DRIVE ON AND OFF OF A SITE, AND LASTLY, THAT 
20:51:33 VEHICLES MUST BE OWNER-OCCUPIED.
20:51:37 
LAURIE IS GOING TO NOW TALK A LITTLE 
20:51:42 BIT ABOUT PARTICIPANT EXPECTATIONS AND RULES FOR THE PROGRAM.
20:51:46 
>> THANK YOU.
20:51:49 
SO PARTICIPANTS, BEFORE ENTERING THE 
20:51:52 PROGRAM, WILL HAVE TO SIGN AND AGREE TO THE FOLLOWING DOCUMENTS.
20:51:56 
FIRST IS A PARTICIPANT  AGREEMENT, 
20:51:57 WHICH A DRAFT HAS BEEN ATTACHED TO THE STAFF REPORT.
20:51:59 
PARTICIPANTS AND THEIR PARTNER SERVICE 
20:52:05 PROVIDERS, FOR EXAMPLE, AN ABODE PROVIDER OR BACS, WILL SIGN THIS 
20:52:11 AGREEMENT TOGETHER, AND THAT OUTLINES EXPECTATIONS FOR COMMITMENT TO 
20:52:13 TRANSITION FROM THE SAFE PARKING PROGRAM INTO STABLE HOUSING.
20:52:15 
NEXT IS A LIABILITY WAIVER WHICH WOULD 
20:52:20 RELEASE THE HOST SITE AND THE CITY FROM ANY LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES TO THE 
20:52:21 PARTICIPANT OR THEIR PROPERTY.
20:52:26 
AND THEN THIRD, IS A STATEMENT OF 
20:52:31 RESPONSIBILITIES AND RULES WHICH A DRAFT IS ALSO ATTACHED TO YOUR STAFF 
20:52:36 REPORT, AND THIS DEFINES BEHAVIOR EXPECTATIONS, RULES, AND A PROCESS FOR 
20:52:39 VIOLATIONS AND AN APPEAL OR GRIEVANCE PROCESS.
20:52:41 
AND ON THE NEXT SLIDE, I'M GOING TO 
20:52:43 PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL ABOUT THAT DOCUMENT.
20:52:49 
SO THIS DOCUMENT WAS CREATED OUT OF A 
20:52:55 COMBINATION OF AN EXISTING FORM WE USE, LIKE OUR WINTER SHELTER PROGRAM, BUT 
20:53:01 IT WAS ALSO INFORMED BY BEST PRACTICES OF ESTABLISH SAFE PARKING PROGRAMS IN 
20:53:03 NEIGHBORING JURISDICTIONS.
20:53:05 
FOSTERING INCLUSIVE PROGRAM FOR 
20:53:09 EVERYONE AND DETAILS, RULES AND EXPECTATIONS TO MAINTAIN A CLEAN, 
20:53:11 RESPECTFUL AND SAFE ENVIRONMENT.
20:53:14 
THREATENING, DANGEROUS AND CRIMINAL 
20:53:19 BEHAVIOR WILL NOT BE TOLERATED, AND RESIDENTS HAVE OPPORTUNITY TO 
20:53:22 CONTRIBUTE TO A SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM AND AN APPEAL OR GRIEVANCE PROCESS IS 
20:53:25 AVAILABLE FOR THOSE WHO DO NOT AGREE WITH A DECISION CONCERNING THEM.
20:53:33 
NOW WE'D LIKE TO SHARE A TABLE SIMILAR 
20:53:38 TO THE ONE IN THE STAFF REPORT THAT OUTLINES THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE 
20:53:38 HOST SITE AND CITY.
20:53:42 
PRIOR TO ACCEPTING VEHICLES, THEY WILL 
20:53:45 AGREE TO A MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING TO THE RESPONSIBILITIES IN THE FIRST 
20:53:45 TWO COLUMNS.
20:53:47 
I'D LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT THAT THE HOST 
20:53:52 SITE MUST DESIGNATE A POINT PERSON WHO'S ACCESSIBLE OVERNIGHT THAT CAN BE 
20:53:56 CALLED UPON FOR ANY REASON ON A  24/7 BASIS.
20:53:58 
THEY WOULD ALSO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE 
20:54:02 DAILY GUEST CHECK-IN AND REGISTRATION AT THE SITE AS WELL AS CHECKOUTS IN 
20:54:03 THE MORNING.
20:54:05 
THE CITY WILL COVER THE LIABILITY 
20:54:08 INSURANCE FOR THE PROGRAM AND PROVIDE DUMPSTER SERVICES.
20:54:10 
THE CITY WILL ALSO PROVIDE OVERALL 
20:54:15 COORDINATION OF THE PROGRAM AS THERE ARE MANY FACTORS TO CONSIDER WITH THE 
20:54:15 ROTATIONAL MODEL.
20:54:18 
SETTING EXPECTATIONS FOR RULES, 
20:54:21 BEHAVIORS AND ENFORCEMENTS IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF EVERYONE, AND 
20:54:25 ALTHOUGH THIS CITY IS OFFICIALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR SCREENING AND 
20:54:30 REFERRALS, WE ENVISION THAT TO BE A COLLABORATIVE PROCESS WITH THE HOST 
20:54:31 SITE AS WELL.
20:54:32 
THE THIRD COLUMN IS A LIST OF 
20:54:35 NEGOTIABLE ITEMS THAT THE HOST SITE, OTHER NON-PROFIT PARTNERS AND 
20:54:37 FAITH-BASED PARTNERS OR THE CITY COULD PROVIDE.
20:54:40 
THESE RESPONSIBILITIES WOULD ALSO BE 
20:54:43 DETERMINED THROUGH THE  MOU PROCESS.
20:54:46 
SO THAT CONCLUDES THE PRESENTATION.
20:54:47 
WE THANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR TIME AND 
20:54:49 WE'RE NOW AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS.
20:54:55 
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
20:54:58 
AND AT THIS TIME, I'LL TURN TO 
20:54:59 QUESTIONS FROM THE  COUNCILMEMBERS.
20:55:01 
CLARIFYING QUESTIONS FROM THE 
20:55:02 COUNCILMEMBERS.
20:55:03 
BEGINNING WITH COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN.
20:55:06 
>> Councilmember Kassan: THANK YOU.
20:55:08 
SO I WANT TO GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF A TYPE 
20:55:11 OF PERSON THAT I'M WONDERING WHAT WE WOULD DO IN THIS SITUATION.
20:55:18 
SO THERE COULD BE A PERSON WHO IS -- 
20:55:23 WAS FORMERLY ELIGIBLE FOR DACA, YOU KNOW, WHO WAS NOT BORN IN THIS 
20:55:27 COUNTRY, WHO WAS BROUGHT ILLEGALLY TO THIS COUNTRY AS A YOUNG PERSON, AND 
20:55:32 NOW THEY'RE STUCK IN THE MESS OF DACA BECAUSE THE JUDGE -- A JUDGE JUST 
20:55:38 DECLARED DACA TO BE ILLEGAL, SO THEY HAVE NO WAY TO GET A DRIVER'S LICENSE, 
20:55:40 BUT THEY MAY HAVE A CAR THAT'S IN GOOD WORKING ORDER.
20:55:44 
SO THAT'S JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF A PERSON 
20:55:48 WHO WE MIGHT REALLY WANT TO SERVE AT THIS LOCATION BUT WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE 
20:55:53 TO BECAUSE THEY WOULDN'T HAVE A DRIVER'S LICENSE, SO I'M WONDERING 
20:55:55 WHAT WE WOULD DO IN THAT SITUATION.
20:56:01 
>> WELL, THAT'S AN INTERESTING 
20:56:04 CHALLENGE, AND I THINK WE'D HAVE TO TAKE A LOOK AT IT.
20:56:10  AND WHAT THE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE AROUND THAT PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL.
20:56:12 
THEY'RE IN A VEHICLE, IS WHAT I'M 
20:56:13 TAKING, IS THAT CORRECT?
20:56:16 
THEY ARE DRIVING ON OUR STREETS AND SO 
20:56:17 FORTH?
20:56:18 
>> Councilmember Kassan: YES.
20:56:19 
>> Ms.
20:56:22  Shenfil: AND THEY CAME TO THIS COUNTRY AT A VERY YOUNG  AGE, SO THEY WOULDN'T 
20:56:28 HAVE HAD ANY DOCUMENTS FROM THEIR  COUNTRIES OF ORIGIN OR --

20:56:32 >> Councilmember Kassan: WELL, I GUESS I'M JUST USING THAT AS AN EXAMPLE, 
20:56:36 JUST, YOU KNOW, ANYONE -- THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY WHO DON'T 
20:56:40 HAVE IMMIGRATION PAPERS, THEY'RE NOT HERE LEGALLY UNDER OUR IMMIGRATION 
20:56:43 LAWS, BUT THEY DO DRIVE.
20:56:45 
AND I DON'T KNOW, YOU KNOW, WHAT 
20:56:49 PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE IN OUR -- IN THE TRI-CITIES ARE IN OUR HOMELESS 
20:56:53 POPULATION THAT MEET THOSE CRITERIA, BUT, YOU KNOW, IT CONCERNS ME THAT 
20:56:57 THOSE PEOPLE WOULDN'T BE ELIGIBLE BECAUSE THEY WOULDN'T HAVE A DRIVER'S 
20:56:57 LICENSE.
20:57:02 
SO I'M JUST WONDERING, I'M  JUST -- 
20:57:04 I'M CONCERNED ABOUT PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE DRIVER'S LICENSES.
20:57:06 
THERE'S MANY, MANY REASONS WHY SOMEONE 
20:57:09 DOESN'T HAVE A DRIVER'S LICENSE AND MAYBE COULDN'T GET ONE, BECAUSE OF 
20:57:11 THEIR IMMIGRATION STATUS.
20:57:14 
SO I WOULD -- I'M JUST CONCERNED ABOUT 
20:57:17 HAVING TO TURN PEOPLE LIKE THAT AWAY.
20:57:20 
>> City Manager Danaj: I WOULD JUST 
20:57:23 ADD, I THINK THAT'S VERY GOOD FEEDBACK.
20:57:25 
I THINK THE STRAIGHT ANSWER -- OR THE 
20:57:29 ANSWER RIGHT NOW WITH THESE RULES, IF THEY'RE TO BE STRICTLY ENFORCED, WOULD 
20:57:32 BE THAT THEY WOULDN'T BE ELIGIBLE, UNLESS WE KEEP SOME ROOM FOR 
20:57:35 ADMINISTRATIVE DISCRETION ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS.
20:57:38 
IN THIS WHOLE CONVERSATION, IT'S 
20:57:41 ESSENTIALLY BALANCING THE DESIRE TO HAVE RULES AND REGULATIONS TO PROTECT 
20:57:47 THE CITY, BUT AT THE SAME TIME MAKING SURE THAT THE BARRIERS AREN'T TOO HIGH 
20:57:51 THAT WE'RE NOT ACTUALLY HELPING PEOPLE WHO ARE ALREADY IN OUR CITY IN THIS 
20:57:52 CONDITION.
20:57:53 
SO I THINK WE'LL HAVE TO CONTINUE TO 
20:57:53 BALANCE THAT.
20:57:55 
IT'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION.
20:57:57 
>> Councilmember Kassan: THANK YOU.
20:58:00 
>> Mayor Mei: NEXT IS COUNCILMEMBER 
20:58:02 COX, CLARIFYING QUESTIONS.
20:58:04 
>> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.
20:58:08 
THANK YOU SO MUCH, LAURIE AND SUZANNE 
20:58:10 FOR YOUR WORK.
20:58:11 
I HAVE QUITE A FEW QUESTIONS.
20:58:11 
BEAR WITH ME.
20:58:16 
FOR RUNNING THIS TYPE OF  PROGRAM, HOW 
20:58:22 MANY CASE MANAGERS ARE REQUIRED, AND DO YOU HAVE THE RESOURCES TO BE ABLE TO 
20:58:23 MANAGE THIS?
20:58:25  AT THIS TIME?
20:58:28 
>> Ms.
20:58:32  Shenfil: SO WE'RE LOOKING AT BUILDING THIS PROGRAM BASED ON PARTNERSHIP AND 
20:58:38 AS WE SUGGESTED, THE PARTICIPANTS WILL COME TO US THROUGH REFERRALS THROUGH 
20:58:45 OUR PARTNER AGENCIES THAT WE WORK REALLY CLOSELY  WITH, AND THE 
20:58:49 PARTICIPANTS WILL ALREADY BE CONNECTED TO A CASE MANAGER SO THAT COULD BE AN 
20:58:56 ABODE CASE MANAGER, A BACS CASE MANAGER, A BACH PERSON OR A HOUSING 
20:58:57 NAVIGATOR.
20:58:59 
SO THEY WILL COME ALREADY CONNECTED, 
20:59:04 AND THEN, OF COURSE, WE ALSO HAVE CASE MANAGEMENT SERVICES TO OUR HUMAN 
20:59:10 SERVICES DEPARTMENT AND WE HAVE CASE MANAGERS WHO WORK WITH OLDER ADULTS 
20:59:13 AND CASE MANAGERS WHO WORK WITH YOUNGER PEOPLE, AND A NUMBER OF THEM CARRY NOT 
20:59:17 A TOTAL CASELOAD OF HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS BUT THEY CERTAINLY HAVE 
20:59:19 HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS ON THEIR CASELOADS.
20:59:25 


20:59:26 >> Councilmember Cox: YOU'RE NOT ANSWERING MY QUESTION.
20:59:28 
I WAS TRYING TO UNDERSTAND, DO WE, AS 
20:59:35 THE CITY OF FREMONT, HAVE THE STAFF TO JUMP RIGHT IN AND OPERATE THIS SAFE 
20:59:37 PARKING PROGRAM?
20:59:38 
>> Ms.
20:59:44  Shenfil: WE HAVE THE STAFF TO GET THE PROGRAM ORGANIZED, AND WE ARE LOOKING 
20:59:51 TO HIRE A PERSON, AN ANALYST WHO WOULD HELP TO OVERSEE THE PROGRAM ON AN 
20:59:52 ONGOING BASIS.
20:59:55 
>> Councilmember Cox: SO YOU'LL HAVE 
21:00:01 ONE DEDICATED RESOURCE THAT'S RUNNING THE OVERALL PROGRAM THAT'S GOING TO BE 
21:00:05 RESPONSIBLE FOR MANAGING FROM START TO FINISH.
21:00:06 
IS THAT WHAT I'M HEARING?
21:00:07 
>> Ms.
21:00:12  Shenfil: AGAIN, WE'RE LOOKING TO BUILD A COLLABORATION WITH THE CHURCHES, SO 
21:00:21 THERE ARE PROGRAM MODELS THAT WE LOOKED AT WHERE CITIES HELP TO BEGIN IN THE 
21:00:24 IMPLEMENTATION, BUT THE CHURCHES HAVE TAKEN OVER PRETTY MUCH THE TOTAL 
21:00:28 OPERATION OF THE PROGRAM, SO WE DON'T SEE THIS AS -- WE SEE AS HELPING TO 
21:00:34 GET THE PROGRAM ORGANIZED AND GETTING THE PIECES TOGETHER TO MAKE IT WORK 
21:00:39 AND TO FOSTERING THE COMMUNICATION AND COORDINATION THAT'S NEEDED FOR 
21:00:45 IMPLEMENTATION TO START, BUT WE DON'T SEE IT AS BEING A  CITY-MANAGED 
21:00:46 PROGRAM HOPEFULLY FOREVER.
21:00:48 
WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE FAITH 
21:00:53 COMMUNITY REALLY EVENTUALLY STEP UP AND TAKE GREATER OWNERSHIP OF THE PROGRAM.
21:00:55 
>> City Manager Danaj: I WOULD JUST 
21:00:59 ALSO ADD JUST TO REMIND THE PUBLIC AND THE COUNCIL THAT WE'RE UNDER DIRECTION 
21:01:04 TO DEVELOP A PROGRAM LIKE THIS AND TO DO IT ESSENTIALLY WITH THE EXISTING 
21:01:07 RESOURCES WE HAVE, INCLUDING THIS ONE VACANCY.
21:01:09 
SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING, AND WE'RE 
21:01:13 DOING IT WITH THE LIMITED RESOURCES WE HAVE, BY LEVERAGING PARTNERSHIPS IN 
21:01:16 THE COMMUNITY THAT HAVE PROVEN SUCCESSFUL IN THE PAST.
21:01:20 
AND THIS IS A CITY THAT PROVIDES MANY 
21:01:23 MORE SOCIAL SERVICES THAT MOST CITIES IN CALIFORNIA, IN LARGE PART IT'S DUE 
21:01:28 TO HUMAN SERVICES AND THEIR ABILITY TO TAKE THE LIMITED RESOURCES THEY HAVE 
21:01:34 AND TO LEVERAGE IT WITH A VARIETY OF PARTNERS, SO WE'RE ESSENTIALLY TRYING 
21:01:37 TO DUPLICATE THAT MODEL, GIVEN THE COUNCIL DIRECTION THAT WE WERE 
21:01:37 PROVIDED.
21:01:39 
>> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.
21:01:43 
WHAT IS THE ESTIMATED COST OR BUDGET?
21:01:45 
WHAT ARE YOU ANTICIPATING AS THE 
21:01:52 BUDGET TO RUN WITH THE ONE MANAGEMENT ANALYST AND THEN POTENTIALLY WITH 
21:01:57 OTHER SUPPORT FROM THE OTHER PARTNERED ORGANIZATIONS?
21:01:58 
JUST ESTIMATE.
21:02:03 
>> Ms.
21:02:07  Shenfil: I'M SORRY, I DON'T HAVE THE COST ESTIMATE FOR AN ANALYST AT THE 
21:02:07 MOMENT.
21:02:11  AVAILABLE.
21:02:14 
>> Councilmember Cox: I THINK THAT 
21:02:17 WOULD BE VERY IMPORTANT, AS WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE A DECISION ABOUT THIS 
21:02:23 PROGRAM, THAT WE HAVE THOSE NUMBERS BEFORE US.
21:02:25 
BECAUSE WITHOUT SOME OF THESE NUMBERS, 
21:02:29 I'M NOT ABLE TO REALLY MAKE A GOOD ASSESSMENT ON THIS PROGRAM WITHOUT 
21:02:29 THAT.
21:02:35 
ANOTHER PART THAT I WANTED TO FIND OUT 
21:02:40 IS, YOU TALKED ABOUT THE LIABILITY WAIVER, AND THAT WASN'T INCLUDED IN 
21:02:45 OUR PACKET FOR THE DOCUMENTS TO REVIEW.
21:02:49 
AND I REALLY WANTED TO UNDERSTAND THAT 
21:02:57 PIECE OF, YOU KNOW, IS THE CITY GOING TO BE PROVIDING ANY TYPE OF LIABILITY 
21:03:00 INSURANCE TO THE PARTNERED ORGANIZATIONS?
21:03:02 
AND I WANTED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT KIND 
21:03:06 OF COVERAGE AND THINGS HAVE BEEN REVIEWED.
21:03:14 
>> SO THE LIABILITY WAIVER AND 
21:03:17 LIABILITY COVERAGE ON THE SITE ARE TWO SEPARATE THINGS.
21:03:19 
THE CITY WOULD EXPAND THEIR LIABILITY 
21:03:21 COVERAGE TO INCLUDE ANY HOST SITE PARTICIPATING IN THE PROGRAM DURING 
21:03:25 THE HOURS THAT THE PROGRAM IS IN  OPERATION, AND THEN THE LIABILITY 
21:03:29 WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT THE PARTICIPANT SIGNS STATING THAT THEY UNDERSTAND 
21:03:33 THAT THE CITY AND THE HOST SITE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR DAMAGES INCURRED ON 
21:03:38 THEIR PROPERTY WHILE THEY'RE PARTICIPATING, AND THAT DOCUMENT WAS 
21:03:40 NOT INCLUDED IN THIS PACKET.
21:03:42 
IT'S STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT, WE'RE 
21:03:46 COLLABORATING WITH THE ATTORNEY'S OFFICE, WE'RE GOING TO START WITH THE 
21:03:52 STANDARD LIABILITY FORM AS FOR MANY OTHER PROGRAMS.
21:03:54 
>> City Manager Danaj: TO JUMP BACK TO 
21:03:57 ONE OF YOUR EARLIER QUESTIONS, COUNCILMEMBER COX, AN ANALYST IS 
21:04:03 APPROXIMATELY 160 TO 120,000 TOTAL COMPENSATION.
21:04:04 
THIS PARTICULAR ANALYST IS ALREADY 
21:04:08 APPROVED IN THE ADOPTED BUDGET FOR THIS EXPLICIT  PURPOSE.
21:04:11 
>> Ms.
21:04:11  Shenfil: THANK YOU, MARK.
21:04:12 
I GOT THAT NUMBER ALSO.
21:04:18 
>> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.
21:04:20 
AS FAR AS LIABILITY INSURANCE, THIS 
21:04:25 WOULD BE THE OVERALL CITY OF FREMONT COMPREHENSIVE TYPE OF INSURANCE PLAN 
21:04:29 SO THAT WOULD BE EXTENDED TO HOST SITES?
21:04:32 
IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE REFERRING  TO, 
21:04:33 LAURIE?
21:04:35 
MS.
21:04:38  MARGOLIS IT'S THE INSURANCE WE HAVE THAT COVERS ALL OF OUR OWNED 
21:04:39 FACILITIES AND BUILDINGS.
21:04:43 
AND IT IS EASY ENOUGH FOR US TO 
21:04:46 INCORPORATE HOST SITES AS WELL FOR THAT INSURANCE.
21:04:47 
IT DOESN'T COST US ANY MORE MONEY.
21:04:50 
>> Councilmember Cox: IT DOESN'T COST 
21:04:51 US ANY MORE MONEY?
21:04:51 
MS.
21:04:51  MARGOLIS NO.
21:04:52 
>> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.
21:04:55 
ANOTHER PART I WANTED TO UNDERSTAND IS 
21:05:06 THAT ONCE A PERSON HAS BEEN LOOKED AT, YOU ANTICIPATE THEM PUTTING IN THE 
21:05:15 APPLICATION TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM, AND WHAT IF THE SERVICES THAT 
21:05:21 THAT INDIVIDUAL PARTICIPANT NEEDS IS NOT GOING TO BE MET IN THIS TYPE OF 
21:05:23 PROGRAM, HOW ARE YOU GOING TO HANDLE THAT SITUATION?
21:05:31 
SO YOU ACCEPT SOMEBODY INTO THE 
21:05:39 PROGRAM, BUT ARE YOU DOING ANY OTHER TYPE OF -- YOU KNOW, IF YOU ARE GOING 
21:05:42 TO DO ANY OTHER -- AS YOU'RE EVALUATING AN INDIVIDUAL AND WHAT IF THE MEDICAL 
21:05:49 SCREENING COMES ABOUT THAT THEY CANNOT BE HELPED IN THIS PROGRAM, WHAT DO YOU 
21:05:51 DO ABOUT THAT PARTICIPANT?
21:05:54 
>> Ms.
21:06:00  Shenfil: WELL, IN  GENERAL, WE WOULD MAKE A REFERRAL TO WHATEVER SERVICE 
21:06:00 THEY NEED.
21:06:02 
WE DO THAT NOW THROUGH OUR CASE 
21:06:05 MANAGEMENT PROGRAM, WE DO THAT WITH PARTICIPANTS AT THE  ISLANDER.
21:06:07 
I MEAN, WE'RE OFTEN WORKING WITH 
21:06:14 PEOPLE TO HELP INCREASE THEIR EMPLOYMENT POTENTIAL BECAUSE HAVING 
21:06:18 MORE INCOME ALLOWS THEM TO HAVE MORE HOUSING OPTIONS.
21:06:20 
SOMETIMES THEY CAN'T GET OVER THE HUMP 
21:06:25 BECAUSE THEY HAVE A MEDICAL PROBLEM, AND GETTING THEM A PRIMARY CARE 
21:06:31 PHYSICIAN AND GETTING THEM MEDICAL ATTENTION IS THE FIRST STEP THEY HAVE 
21:06:34 TO TAKE TO GET READY TO BE ABLE TO MOVE INTO PERMANENT HOUSING.
21:06:37 
SO EACH CLIENT OR EACH PARTICIPANT 
21:06:44 PRESENTS WITH UNIQUE PROBLEMS AND WE WORK COLLECTIVELY AS A TEAM WITH THE 
21:06:49 OTHER CASE MANAGERS AND HOUSING NAVIGATORS TO TRY TO FIND THE BEST 
21:06:49 OUTCOMES FOR PEOPLE.
21:06:52 
WE CAN'T SAY THEY'RE ALL GOING TO BE 
21:06:57 PUT INTO PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING, BUT WE'RE GOING TO TRY AND PROVIDE 
21:06:57 BETTER OUTCOMES FOR THEM.
21:07:02 
>> Councilmember Cox: BUT WHAT IF THEY 
21:07:03 CAN'T BE HELPED?
21:07:05 
WHAT IF IT'S SOMEONE THAT EITHER HAS A 
21:07:11 SUBSTANCE ABUSE OR HAS MENTAL HEALTH ISSUE THAT CANNOT BE SUPPORTED AND 
21:07:18 THEY NEED MORE LONGER TERM CARE AND ADDRESSING, AND IT DOESN'T SOUND AT 
21:07:23 LEAST FROM THE OUTSIDE AS I'M  LISTENING, WHERE DO THEY GO?
21:07:25 
>> Ms.
21:07:30  Shenfil: WELL, I CAN ONLY SPEAK -- WE'VE HAD CLIENTS WHO ARE AT THE 
21:07:38 ISLANDER WHO WERE VERY SERIOUSLY HAVING SUBSTANCE ABUSE PROBLEMS.
21:07:43 
WE USED OUR SUBSTANCE INTERVENTION 
21:07:47 FOLKS THROUGH OUR YOUTH AND FAMILY COUNSELING AND WE GOT THEM INTO A 
21:07:50 TREATMENT PROGRAM AND THEY SUCCEEDED VERY WELL.
21:07:53 
SO YOU CAN'T ALWAYS TELL IF PEOPLE 
21:08:00 PRESENT WITH A SUBSTANCE ISSUE OR MENTAL HEALTH ISSUE, WITH THE RIGHT 
21:08:04 TREATMENT, WITH THE RIGHT MEDICATION, OFTEN THEIR OUTCOMES ARE VERY  POSITIVE.
21:08:08 
>> Councilmember Cox: SO THERE IS A 
21:08:08 --
>> City Manager Danaj: I THINK IT 
21:08:12 MIGHT BE HELPFUL TO UNDERSTAND THIS, A LOT OF THESE CRITERIA ARE THE VERY 
21:08:16 SAME CRITERIA THAT WE'RE USING AT OUR HOUSING NAVIGATION CENTER OR AT THE 
21:08:18 ISLANDER HOTEL THAT SUZANNE JUST BROUGHT UP.
21:08:20 
AND THE SHORT ANSWER IS THAT SOME 
21:08:28 PEOPLE , WE'RE SUCCESSFUL HELPING, SOME PEOPLE, WE'RE NOT.
21:08:29 
JUST GIVEN THE TRACK RECORD OF HUMAN 
21:08:32 SERVICES DEVELOPING THESE RELATIONSHIPS, MANY TIMES WE ARE 
21:08:33 SUCCESSFUL.
21:08:35 
SO SHORT OF THE CRITERIA FOCUSING 
21:08:39 AROUND AN AUTOMOBILE, THE ISSUE ABOUT HELPING THEM FOR WHATEVER REASON THAT 
21:08:43 THEY'RE HOMELESS, WHICH DOES INCLUDE SUBSTANCE ABUSE, THAT'S A VERY GOOD 
21:08:48 POINT, COUNCILMEMBER, ARE THE CRITERIA WE'VE BEEN USING, AND FRANKLY HAVE 
21:08:52 BEEN SORT OF PROVING CRITERIA IN THOSE TWO OTHER AREAS ALREADY, WE'RE SIMPLY 
21:08:54 APPLYING TO THE SAFE PARKING CONVERSATION.
21:08:56 
>> Councilmember Cox: I UNDERSTAND.
21:09:00 
I WAS NOT PART OF THE DECISION-MAKING 
21:09:03 FOR THE NAVIGATION CENTER, SO I'M ASKING QUESTIONS SO I CAN HAVE SOME 
21:09:03 BACKGROUND, PLEASE.
21:09:05 
SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WHERE 
21:09:09  COULD THE OTHER ONES GO?
21:09:11 
IF YOU CAN HELP SOME, THAT'S ONE 
21:09:13 THING, BUT WE'VE ALSO GOT TO DEAL WITH REALITY.
21:09:15 
WHERE IS IT THAT THE OTHERS THAT COULD 
21:09:21 NOT BE HELPED, JUST SO I UNDERSTAND THE EXPECTATIONS OF THIS PROGRAM.
21:09:24 
>> Ms.
21:09:26  Shenfil: QUITE CANDIDLY, SOMETIMES THEY GO BACK ON THE STREET.
21:09:29 
I MEAN, THEY HAVE TO BE WILLING TO 
21:09:33 ENGAGE AND THEY HAVE TO HAVE SOME LEVEL OF MOTIVATION TO COME IN TO THE 
21:09:37 PROGRAM, AND WE HOPE WITH SUPPORT AND BY WORKING WITH THEM, THAT THEY WILL 
21:09:39 BE SUCCESSFUL.
21:09:42 
OR AT LEAST ONE STEP CLOSER TO BEING 
21:09:42 SUCCESSFUL.
21:09:45 
>> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.
21:09:49 
OKAY, I APPRECIATE THE REALITY CHECK 
21:09:51 THERE, OKAY?
21:09:54 
HOW LONG ARE YOU ANTICIPATING THAT WE 
21:09:58 HAVE THIS SAFE PARKING PROGRAM?
21:10:04 
>> Ms.
21:10:11  Shenfil: YOU KNOW, I WOULD HOPE IT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD GET 
21:10:14 STARTED AND IT WOULD BE SUCCESSFUL.
21:10:15 
WE CERTAINLY HAVE A LOT OF  HOMELESS 
21:10:20 PEOPLE, AND WE HAVE ANTICIPATION THAT THE POPULATION IS GROWING.
21:10:23 
SO I CAN'T ANSWER THE QUESTION OF WHEN 
21:10:25 ARE WE GOING TO END HOMELESSNESS.
21:10:27 
BUT IT'S AN ALTERNATIVE, IT'S AN 
21:10:32 OPTION, AND IT'S A WAY OF PROVIDING ASSISTANCE FOR SOME PEOPLE THAT FIT 
21:10:35 THE CRITERIA AND ARE WILLING TO WORK WITH US.
21:10:38 
>> City Manager Danaj: AND I WOULD ADD 
21:10:43 THAT I THINK WE WOULD HAVE THIS PROGRAM INDEFINITELY, SHORT OF THE CITY 
21:10:48 COUNCIL CHANGING -- A CITY COUNCIL CHANGING THEIR PRIORITIES ON THE 
21:10:52 TOPIC, AND/OR TO WHEN THE STATE OR OUR SOCIETY CAN HELP END  HOMELESSNESS.
21:10:57 
>> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.
21:11:00 
I WAS LOOKING THROUGH YOUR DOCUMENTS, 
21:11:06 AND A LOT OF IT IS -- IT'S -- I CALL IT RULES OF ENGAGEMENT.
21:11:09 
I DON'T SEE ANYTHING REFERENCING ANY 
21:11:19 TYPE OF FREMONT'S MUNICIPAL CODE OR ANY OTHER CODES TO MAKE IT MORE LEGAL 
21:11:20 BINDING ON THESE AGREEMENTS.
21:11:24 
I JUST SEE IT AS IT'S A MUTUAL 
21:11:25 UNDERSTANDING.
21:11:30 
AND SO IT JUST DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH 
21:11:34 TEETH IN THIS AGREEMENT.
21:11:36 
WAS THERE ANY REASON WHY WE DIDN'T TIE 
21:11:43 IN SOME OTHER THINGS OF ANY TYPE OF BACKGROUND  SCREENING OR ANY TYPE OF 
21:11:48 OTHER THINGS THAT WOULD BE MORE ENFORCEABLE?
21:11:54  TO PROTECT THE CITY, TO PROTECT THE COMMUNITY?
21:11:55 
>> Ms.
21:12:01  Shenfil: WELL, WE THINK THERE'S A LOT OF LIABILITY COVERAGE ALREADY, WE'VE 
21:12:04 ALREADY TALKED ABOUT THAT.
21:12:06 
YOU KNOW, WORKING WITH THE  HOMELESS, 
21:12:12 I THINK WE'VE LEARNED A LOT IN THE LAST DECADE, AND IN GENERAL, WE'VE LEARNED 
21:12:17 THAT PEOPLE NEED TO BE TREATED WITH DIGNITY AND THEY NEED TO BE TREATED 
21:12:24 WITH RESPECT, AND PROGRAMS LIKE THE HOUSING NAVIGATION CENTER USES A LOW 
21:12:36 BARRIER, LOW THRESHOLD ENTRY CRITERIA, BECAUSE IT'S ABOUT GIVING PEOPLE THE 
21:12:39 BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT AND GIVING THEM AN OPPORTUNITY TO, YOU KNOW, BE TREATED 
21:12:45 AS A RESPONSIBLE ADULT AND IN MOST CASES, PEOPLE STEP UP AND RESPOND.
21:12:48 
I DON'T KNOW, LAURIE MIGHT WANT TO 
21:12:55 JUMP IN THERE, BUT YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT -- THE IDEA IS TO CREATE LOW BARRIERS, 
21:13:00 AND TO BUILD TRUST, AND TO GET PEOPLE TO COME IN OFF THE STREET.
21:13:03 
JUST BECAUSE WE HAVE A SAFE PARKING 
21:13:07 PROGRAM DOESN'T MEAN WE'RE GOING TO HAVE PARTICIPANTS WHO WANT TO 
21:13:16 PARTICIPATE IF WE CREATE -- IF WE CREATE SUCH HIGH CRITERIA, PEOPLE 
21:13:17 WON'T COME IN.
21:13:21 
YOU HAVE TO KIND OF ACCEPT PEOPLE 
21:13:24 WHERE THEY ARE AND WORK WITH THEM, AND AGAIN, TREAT THEM WITH DIGNITY AND 
21:13:29 RESPECT, AND IN MOST INSTANCES, PEOPLE APPRECIATE THAT AND THEY STEP UP, AND 
21:13:30 THEY RESPOND.
21:13:34 
AND THEN YOU HAVE RULES IF THEY CAN'T 
21:13:38 -- YOU KNOW, IF THEY CAN'T ACT APPROPRIATELY AND IF THEY CAN'T FOLLOW 
21:13:45 THE RULES, THEN THEY GET WARNINGS, THEN THEY, YOU KNOW, GET EXITED FROM THE 
21:13:46 PROGRAM.
21:13:52 
BUT THE THING IS NOT TO, YOU KNOW, DO 
21:13:55 A LOT OF EXTRA CHECKING ON PEOPLE.
21:13:57 
>> Mayor Mei: SO MY APOLOGIES, I ALSO 
21:14:00 WANTED TO -- I KNOW THAT WE'VE GOT QUITE A FEW SPEAKERS THAT HAVE BEEN 
21:14:01 WAITING SOME TIME TO SPEAK.
21:14:02 
I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S OKAY, BECAUSE 
21:14:03 WE'RE GOING TO COME BACK FOR A DISCUSSION.
21:14:07 
I ALSO SEE A CLARIFYING QUESTION FROM 
21:14:08 VICE MAYOR SHAO.
21:14:10 
>> Councilmember Cox: I'M STILL NOT 
21:14:10 FINISHED, MAYOR MEI.
21:14:13 
I DON'T APPRECIATE BEING CUT OFF HERE.
21:14:15 
I HAVE SOME MORE QUESTIONS AND I'M NOT 
21:14:20 GETTING THEM ALL ANSWERED, AND I THINK IN DUE FAIRNESS SINCE YOU ASKED US AS 
21:14:25 COUNCILMEMBERS TO SPEAK, THAT I DESERVE TO HAVE THE FULL OPPORTUNITY TO ASK AS 
21:14:31 MANY QUESTIONS AS I CAN, EVEN THOUGH THE PUBLIC IS WAITING, BUT I'M NOT 
21:14:32 FINISHED YET.
21:14:33 
>> Mayor Mei: I THINK THAT IT'S ALSO 
21:14:37 TRYING TO BE RESPECTFUL, I KNOW WE ALREADY TOOK A BREAK EARLIER, AND SO I 
21:14:40 WAS GOING TO ASK --
>> Councilmember Cox: I  DISAGREE.
21:14:41 
THAT'S NOT FAIR.
21:14:47 
>> Mayor Mei: COULD WE THEN SET A TIME 
21:14:52 FRAME IN TERMS OF WHAT YOU THINK WOULD BE REASONABLE OR AMPLE TIME?
21:14:54 
WE NORMALLY GET OUR AGENDAS ON A 
21:15:00 THURSDAY, AND SO THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW THAT, AND SO I 
21:15:06 KNOW THAT WE HAVE TRIED AS A COUNCIL TO TRY TO, IN PAST PRACTICE, SEND SOME OF 
21:15:11 OUR CLARIFYING QUESTIONS IF THEY ARE SOMETHING SIMPLE THAT CAN BE ANSWERED 
21:15:13 FROM STAFF, AND WE CAN ASK THE QUESTIONS AGAIN, BECAUSE WE DO WANT 
21:15:16 THE PUBLIC TO BE AWARE OF THOSE QUESTIONS, BUT I ALSO AM TRYING TO 
21:15:20 MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE RESPECTFUL FOR THE AUDIENCE THAT HAS BEEN WAITING AND SO 
21:15:24 THAT WE CAN CONTINUE -- AND MAYBE THEIR QUESTIONS MIGHT BE ONES THAT YOU ARE 
21:15:26 ALSO GOING TO BE ASKING OR THAT YOU CAN BUILD UPON.
21:15:29 
>> Councilmember Cox: WELL, I THINK 
21:15:33 THAT YOU SHOULD GIVE ME THE FULL RESPECT OF ALLOWING ME TO ANSWER A 
21:15:37 COUPLE MORE QUESTIONS THAT I STILL HAVE, AND REGARDLESS IF YOU SEND IT 
21:15:41 OUT ON THURSDAY, THERE'S STILL MORE QUESTIONS THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED, 
21:15:44 OUT OF DUE RESPECT FOR ME AS A FELLOW  COUNCILMEMBER.
21:15:46 
>> Mayor Mei: WELL, WHY DON'T YOU 
21:15:50 CONTINUE AND FINISH YOUR QUESTIONS AND THEN WE'LL MAKE SURE THAT VICE MAYOR 
21:15:52 SHAO AND ALSO OUR AUDIENCE IS ABLE TO ASK THEIRS.
21:15:54 
BECAUSE I JUST WANTED TO BE SURE THAT 
21:16:00 WE ARE GIVEN CLARIFICATIONS IN TERMS OF CLARIFYING QUESTIONS VERSUS COMMENTS.
21:16:02 
>> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.
21:16:05 
MY OTHER QUESTION IS, YOU MENTIONED 
21:16:07 ABOUT THE HOSTING SITE AGREEMENTS.
21:16:10 
I DON'T SEE THAT INCLUDED IN THE 
21:16:11 PACKAGE AS WELL.
21:16:12 
I REALLY APPRECIATE IF I COULD SEE THE 
21:16:17 WHOLE PACKAGE AND TO REVIEW THE WHOLE ENTIRE PROGRAM, SO WE COULD GET A 
21:16:18 COMPLETE PICTURE.
21:16:24 
>> SO THE DRAFT HOST SITE AGREEMENTS 
21:16:30 ARE STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT, AND PROVIDING THE MATRIX WAS TO PROVIDE 
21:16:33 THE STRUCTURE OF WHAT THE MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING WOULD REALLY COVER.
21:16:36 
EACH HOST SITE MIGHT DIFFER DEPENDING 
21:16:40 ON WHAT THE SITE IS AVAILABLE TO PROVIDE.
21:16:43 
SO WE'RE STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT AND 
21:16:46 WORKING WITH THE ATTORNEY'S OFFICE ON THAT PARTICULAR DOCUMENT.
21:16:47 
>> Councilmember Cox: IS THERE A 
21:16:52 REASON WHY WE DIDN'T PUT IT ALL TOGETHER AS ONE COMPLETE PACKAGE THAT 
21:16:58 ONE COULD REVIEW, THE PARTICIPANT, THE HOST SITE, AND GET THE WHOLE VIEW AS 
21:16:59 WE REVIEW THIS WHOLE PROGRAM?
21:17:02 
I JUST FEEL THIS IS VERY PIECEMEAL, 
21:17:07 AND WE NEEDED TO PUT THIS ALL TOGETHER AS ONE BIG PICTURE.
21:17:16 
>> City Manager Danaj: COUNCILME MBER, 
21:17:22 WE TYPICALLY DON'T BRING ADMINISTRATIVE AGREEMENTS TO COUNCIL UNLESS THEY -- 
21:17:24 AN INCIDENT THAT COSTS OVER $100,000.
21:17:25 
SO WHAT'S HAPPENED HERE IS THE COUNCIL 
21:17:30 APPROVED A LAND USE DESIGNATION TO PROVIDE FOR THIS TYPE OF SERVICE AND 
21:17:34 PARTNERSHIP AND THE COUNCIL ASKED US TO COME BACK WITH CRITERIA ON HOW WE WERE 
21:17:37 GOING TO MANAGE IT, AND HOW WE WERE GOING TO INTERACT WITH PEOPLE COMING 
21:17:38 IN TO THE PROGRAM.
21:17:40 
SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HERE FOR.
21:17:42 
IF THE COUNCIL WANTS TO CHANGE ITS 
21:17:46 DIRECTION AND BE MORE FOCUSED ON APPROVING THE ADMINISTRATIVE DOCUMENTS 
21:17:49 YOU'RE LOOKING FOR, THAT'S I THINK SOMETHING FOR YOU AND YOUR COLLEAGUES 
21:17:49 TO DISCUSS.
21:17:56 
>> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.
21:17:57 
THANK YOU, MARK.
21:18:00 
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU FOR YOUR 
21:18:01 CLARIFYING QUESTIONS.
21:18:03 
WE WILL BRING IT BACK FOR DISCUSSION.
21:18:06 
VICE MAYOR SHAO, DO YOU HAVE A 
21:18:07 CLARIFYING QUESTION?
21:18:09 
>> Vice Mayor Shao: SURE.
21:18:13 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE 
21:18:14 PRESENTATION.
21:18:21 
AND THE QUESTION THAT I HAVE WAS 
21:18:24 ACTUALLY ASKED DURING THE STAFF BRIEFING BUT FOR THE PUBLIC'S SAKE, I 
21:18:27 WOULD LIKE YOU TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION AGAIN.
21:18:33 
I APPRECIATE THAT THIS PROGRAM IS FOR 
21:18:37 LOCAL HOMELESS PEOPLE LIVING IN VEHICLES.
21:18:41 
SINCE WE INCLUDE THE NEW WORK IN UNION 
21:18:48  -- INCLUDE NEWARK AND UNION CITY, I WOULD LIKE YOU TO ONCE AGAIN EXPLAIN 
21:18:52 HOW THE THREE CITIES ARE COORDINATING OR HELPING EACH OTHER IN COMBATING 
21:18:54 HOMELESSNESS IN THIS CASE.
21:18:55 
>> Ms.
21:18:55  Shenfil: SURE.
21:18:57 
I'M GLAD TO RESPOND TO THAT.
21:19:00 
SO WE HAVE HAD A -- KIND OF AN 
21:19:06 INFORMAL RECIPROCAL RELATIONSHIP WITH UNION CITY THAT HAS A SAFE PARKING 
21:19:12 PROGRAM, THEY'VE OPERATED PROBABLY FOR AT LEAST FOUR YEARS NOW CALLED CARAVAN.
21:19:14 
THERE'S IS A ROTATIONAL PROGRAM, BUT 
21:19:18 RATHER THAN ROTATING  MONTHLY, IT ROTATES EACH DAY TO A DIFFERENT 
21:19:19 LOCATION.
21:19:29  WITH A SET NUMBER OF LOCATIONS, AND IT SERVES CARS AND VANS, NOT RVs, BUT 
21:19:35 THEY HAVE FOR MANY YEARS ACCEPTED FREMONT RESIDENTS.
21:19:39 
SO WE FEEL THAT IT'S A RECIPROCAL 
21:19:45 THING TO ACCEPT POTENTIAL UNION CITY RESIDENTS IN OUR SAFE PARKING PROGRAM.
21:19:48 
NEWARK IS VERY SMALL, BUT THEIR 
21:19:50 CONTRIBUTION IS USUALLY THROUGH FUNDING.
21:19:53 
SO THEY HAVE FUNDING -- FUNDED, FOR 
21:19:58 EXAMPLE, PART OF OUR CLEAN START PROGRAM, THEY'VE FUNDED SOME OF OUR 
21:20:03 HOUSING NAVIGATION CENTER, SO AGAIN, WE FEEL IT'S JUST REALLY -- AND THE 
21:20:10 POPULATION IS KIND OF MOBILE AMONG OUR THREE CITIES, THAT IT'S GOOD TO 
21:20:12 RECIPROCATE WITH THE OTHER JURISDICTIONS.
21:20:17 
>> Vice Mayor Shao: THANK YOU.
21:20:22 
AND I ALSO WANT TO ASK YOU TO CLARIFY 
21:20:30 THAT, BECAUSE THE AGREEMENT WITH EACH AND EVERY FAITH-BASED ORGANIZATION IS 
21:20:37 DOWN THROUGH NEGOTIATION, THEREFORE, THERE CANNOT BE A PAPER CUTTER 
21:20:39 AGREEMENT FOR EACH AND EVERY SITE.
21:20:42 
RATHER, THE DETAILS WOULD BE FINALIZED 
21:20:44 THROUGH NEGOTIATION.
21:20:44 
IS THAT CORRECT?
21:20:45 
>> Ms.
21:20:48  Shenfil: YES, THAT'S ABSOLUTELY CORRECT.
21:20:48 
>> Vice Mayor Shao: THANK YOU.
21:20:51 
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
21:20:53 
SEEING NO OTHER CLARIFYING QUESTIONS 
21:20:58 FROM THE COUNCIL AT THIS TIME, I'D LIKE TO TURN AND OPEN THE PUBLIC COMMENT 
21:20:58 PERIOD.
21:21:01 
AND I THANK THOSE WHO HAVE  JOINED US 
21:21:05 THIS EVENING, BECAUSE THEY'D LIKE TO SHARE ABOUT THEIR FEEDBACK ON THIS 
21:21:06 TOPIC.
21:21:11 
WE'LL BEGIN WITH THE SPEAKER LISA DANZ.
21:21:12 
WELCOME THIS EVENING, MS.
21:21:13  DANZ.
21:21:14 
>> HI.
21:21:14 
THANK YOU.
21:21:18 
I'M LISA DANZ FROM DISTRICT 3.
21:21:19 
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THAT I WANT 
21:21:25 TO SHARE IS THAT I WANT TO URGE YOU TO DO TWO THINGS, TO VOTE AYE ON THIS 
21:21:30 STAFF RECOMMENDATION, AND ALSO TO DIRECT THE STAFF TO IMPLEMENT PRONGS 
21:21:32 TWO AND THREE OF THE SAFE PARKING PROGRAM AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.
21:21:35 
SO THAT INCLUDES THE SAFE PARKING 
21:21:38 SANCTIONED STREET PARKING AS WELL AS THE CITY MANAGED PERMANENT SAFE 
21:21:39 PARKING.
21:21:44 
AND THAT'S BECAUSE THIS ITEM IS REALLY 
21:21:47 HELPFUL BUT AS WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING, IT ONLY SERVES A LIMITED POPULATION.
21:21:50 
SO WE NEED TO MOVE QUICKLY TO SERVE 
21:21:53 THE REST OF OUR VEHICLE DWELLING POPULATION.
21:21:56 
AND TO THAT END, THE REASON WHY WE 
21:22:00 NEED TO MOVE ON THAT QUICKLY IS BECAUSE WE TALKED A LOT ABOUT FUNDING FOR 
21:22:00 THOSE PROGRAMS.
21:22:02 
THE ONLY WAY THAT WE'RE GOING TO GET 
21:22:07 FUNDING IS IF WE DO A GRANT PROPOSAL, AND SO AS I UNDERSTAND IT, I KNOW I'M 
21:22:10 NOT THE EXPERT HERE, BUT FROM WHAT I'VE HEARD PEOPLE WHO KNOW THIS BETTER THAN 
21:22:15 I DO IS THAT WE FIRST NEED TO MAKE A PLAN AND PROPOSE A CONCRETE ACTION 
21:22:18 THAT THE CITY WILL TAKE, THEN WE CAN APPLY FOR FUNDING, AND THEN IF WE GET 
21:22:21 THE FUNDING, WE CAN ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT THE PLAN.
21:22:22 
SO WE CAN'T WAIT FOR FUNDING BEFORE 
21:22:26 MAKING THE PLAN BECAUSE THAT WAY WE WON'T GET THE FUNDING.
21:22:29 
IN PARTICULAR, GOVERNOR NEWSOM'S NEW 
21:22:34 BUDGET PROPOSES $12 BILLION FOR HOMELESSNESS SOLUTION, AND FREMONT'S 
21:22:39 UNHOUSED RESIDENTS DESERVE FOR THEIR CITY TO REQUEST A SHARE OF THAT BUDGET 
21:22:41 TO SERVE THEIR NEEDS, BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT IT'S FOR.
21:22:45 
AND I THINK THERE MIGHT NEED TO BE A 
21:22:49 SPECIAL SESSION DURING THE UPCOMING RECESS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GET ON 
21:22:54 THAT BUDGET REQUEST BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE AND ALL ALLOCATED TO OTHER 
21:22:57 CITIES, BUT I DEFINITELY WANT TO JUST MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE GOING AHEAD WITH 
21:23:00 MOVING FORWARD ON THE OTHER PRONG.
21:23:02 
I ALSO WANT TO SAY I REALLY APPRECIATE 
21:23:07 COUNCILMEMBER  KASSAN'S COMMENT AND I WOULD ENCOURAGE A FRIENDLY AMENDMENT 
21:23:10 TO STRIKE THE DRIVER'S LICENSE REQUIREMENT.
21:23:12 
I THINK THAT WAS ALREADY TOO MUCH OF A 
21:23:16 BARRIER TO ENTRY, AND HER POINT THAT FOR SOME RESIDENTS IT'S ACTUALLY NOT 
21:23:21 JUST EXPENSIVE BUT LITERALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO GET A LICENSE MEANS THAT THIS 
21:23:23 PROGRAM IS GOING TO BE CLOSED OFF TO TOO MANY PEOPLE.
21:23:24 
SO I WOULD LOVE TO SEE A PROGRAM THAT 
21:23:26 DOES NOT HAVE THAT REQUIREMENT.
21:23:27 
MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT OUR 
21:23:32 NEIGHBORING CITIES HAVE PARITY WITH THAT, THAT THEY DON'T REQUIRE DRIVER 
21:23:34 LICENSES AND THAT THEIR PROGRAMS ARE WORKING FINE.
21:23:37 
SO TO RECAP THE TOP TWO ITEMS THAT I'D 
21:23:41 LIKE TO YOU DO IS TO VOTE AYE, AND TO DIRECT THE STAFF TO IMPLEMENT THE NEXT 
21:23:42 PRONGS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.
21:23:42 
THANK YOU.
21:23:48 
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU, MS.
21:23:49  MS.
21:23:49  DANZ.
21:23:50 
NEXT SPEAKER IS MARIE HUGHES.
21:23:51 
WELCOME.
21:23:51 
>> THANK YOU.
21:23:54 
MY NAME IS MARIE HUGHES AND I LIVE IN NILES.
21:23:58 
I SUPPORT THE SAFE PARKING PROGRAM 
21:24:01 WITH THE PROPOSED PROGRAM DESIGN THAT WAS  PRESENTED TONIGHT.
21:24:03 
I'VE LOOKED OVER THE PROPOSAL AND 
21:24:07 BELIEVE PUBLIC SAFETY CONCERNS HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED, WHILE PROVIDING 
21:24:12 SUCCESSFUL PATHWAYS TO PERMANENT HOUSING FOR THOSE WHO LIVE IN CARS AND 
21:24:12  RVs.
21:24:14 
I SUPPORT THIS PROGRAM FOR MANY 
21:24:16 REASONS, TWO OF WHICH ARE SAFETY AND SECURITY.
21:24:20 
IN TERMS OF SAFETY, WE HAVE AN 
21:24:25 UNOFFICIAL PARKING PROGRAM GOING ON IN NILES, WHERE HOMELESS PEOPLE ARE 
21:24:28 LIVING IN A PARK WHILE THEY WAIT FOR THE CITY TO CREATE SANCTION SITES.
21:24:30 
AND YESTERDAY THERE WAS A FIRE THERE.
21:24:32 
FIRES IN THE CANYON ARE DANGEROUS.
21:24:35 
AND THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME THAT 
21:24:36 THIS HAS HAPPENED THIS  YEAR.
21:24:38 
BUT WITHOUT AN OFFICIAL PLACE TO PARK 
21:24:44 THEIR RVs FIRE IS JUST GOING TO BE AN ONGOING DANGER.
21:24:46 
IT WOULD BE MUCH BETTER FOR EVERYONE 
21:24:50 IF WE HAVE SANCTIONED PROGRAMS WITH ACCESS TO SANITATION, TRASH REMOVAL 
21:24:54 AND COMMUNITY RULES RATHER THAN LETTING PEOPLE JUST SORT OF CONGREGATE 
21:24:54 WHEREVER.
21:25:02 
SECONDLY, OUR UNHOUSED -- AN RV CAN BE 
21:25:08 A GREAT HOME, ACTUALLY BUY RVs TO LIVE IN FULL TIME ON PURPOSE, BUT YOU NEED 
21:25:10 SOME PLACE TO PARK THEM.
21:25:12 
HAVING OFFICIAL PARKING SITES TURNS AN 
21:25:16 RV INTO THE HOME AND GIVES THE SECURITY NEEDED TO FIND PERMANENT HOUSING.
21:25:19 
SO THIS PROPOSED PROGRAM IS A GOOD 
21:25:20 START.
21:25:22 
HOWEVER, AS HAS BEEN SAID BY OTHERS, 
21:25:23 IT'S NOT ENOUGH.
21:25:25 
WE ALSO NEED TO IMPLEMENT THE 
21:25:32 REMAINING TWO PRONGS OF HUMAN SERVICES PROPOSALS, THE SANCTIONED SAFE PARKING 
21:25:33 STREET AND CITYWIDE PARKING LOTS.
21:25:35 
THE CITY COMMITTED TO DOING THIS THREE 
21:25:37 YEARS AGO.
21:25:38 
IT WELL PAST TIME FOR TO BE 
21:25:39 IMPLEMENTED.
21:25:41 
PLEASE DO WHATEVER YOU CAN TO MAKE IT 
21:25:44 FINALLY HAPPEN, WHETHER THAT MEANS PROVIDING MORE FUNDING OR MORE STAFF 
21:25:45 OR BOTH.
21:25:48 
AND FINALLY, I URGE THE CITY TO START 
21:25:54 APPLYING FOR SOME OF THAT $12 BILLION IN HOMELESS FUNDS THAT THE STATE HAS 
21:25:58 MADE AVAILABLE, AND USE THEM TO EXPAND EXISTING PROGRAMS AND IMPLEMENTING THE 
21:26:00 OTHER TWO PRONGS.
21:26:00 
THANK YOU.
21:26:04 
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
21:26:07 
NEXT SPEAKER IS SHARON SCHARFF.
21:26:08 
WELCOME, SHARON.
21:26:09 
>> WELCOME, THANK YOU.
21:26:13 
I HAVE THREE QUESTIONS, SOME ARE 
21:26:16 ALIGNED -- ALONG THE LINE OF COUNCILWOMAN COX.
21:26:18 
ONE, WHAT ARE THE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE 
21:26:22 HOST SITES TO OBTAIN A PERMIT THAT'S MENTIONED?
21:26:26 
TWO, IS THERE ANY FEE FOR THE PERMIT 
21:26:31 OR IS THERE ANY COMPENSATION FOR THE HOSTING INVOLVED?
21:26:33 
AND LASTLY, I SEE THE CITY IS WILLING 
21:26:38 TO PROTECT, INSURANCE THE HOST SITES FROM ANY DAMAGE CAUSED BY PARTICIPANTS.
21:26:41 
YET THE FACT THAT POTENTIALLY 
21:26:46 UNINSURED, UNLICENSED DRIVERS WILL BE BEING BROUGHT INTO MOST LIKELY 
21:26:52 RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOODS IS A FRANKLY UNACCEPTABLE  DANGER.
21:26:56 
I UNDERSTAND INSURANCE IS A 
21:27:05 REQUIREMENT AND CURRENT  LICENSES, BUT REALISTICALLY,  WHO'S GOING TO ENFORCE 
21:27:11 -- WHO'S GOING TO ENFORCE THIS OR MONITOR IT ON A DAILY BASIS?
21:27:14 
SO PERHAPS THE HOST SITES OR THE CITY 
21:27:23 WOULD BE WILLING TO COVER AUTO INSURANCE AND UNINSURED -- OR 
21:27:27 UNLICENSED DRIVER'S INSURANCE TO PROTECT THE RESIDENTS OF THE CITY OF 
21:27:31 FREMONT, AND I WOULD -- IF THIS INFORMATION IS ALREADY AVAILABLE, 
21:27:36 PLEASE DIRECT ME TO WHERE THIS CAN BE OBTAINED.
21:27:36 
THANK YOU.
21:27:38 
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
21:27:40 
NEXT SPEAKER IS ELAINE SANCHEZ.
21:27:41 
WELCOME, SISTER.
21:27:50 
PLEASE UNMUTE ELAINE SANCHEZ.
21:28:04 
>> OKAY, SORRY.
21:28:07 
I'M HERE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT FOR THE 
21:28:08 SAFE PARKING PROGRAM.
21:28:09 
FIRST OF ALL, I WOULD LIKE TO COMMEND 
21:28:14 CITY STAFF MEMBERS WHO PUT THIS COMPREHENSIVE SAFE PARKING PROGRAM IN 
21:28:18 PLACE, AND TO MEET THE NEEDS OF RESIDENTS WHO ARE NOW LIVING IN THEIR 
21:28:19  VEHICLES.
21:28:23 
THESE PAST SEVERAL MONTHS, I ALONG 
21:28:29 WITH OTHER FAITH LEADERS FROM OUR COMMUNITY, PARTICIPATED IN A NUMBER OF 
21:28:31 ZOOM MEETINGS AND THEY WERE QUITE A FEW.
21:28:33 
IT COVERED A LOT OF MATERIAL.
21:28:37 
FIRST OF ALL, IT WAS  EDUCATIONAL.
21:28:43 
WE HEARD ABOUT BEST PRACTICES, AND WE 
21:28:47 ALSO HAD OUR QUESTIONS ANSWERED, OUR CONCERNS AND SUGGESTIONS WERE TAKEN 
21:28:49 SERIOUSLY BY THE CITY STAFF.
21:28:53 
AND I BELIEVE THE DOCUMENTS TONIGHT 
21:28:58 THAT WERE PRESENTED AN THE PRESENTATION BY LAURIE AND SUZANNE REALLY IS A 
21:29:00 TESTAMENT TO THE HARD WORK THAT THEY'VE DONE.
21:29:03 
FREMONT SAFE PARKING PROGRAM IS VERY 
21:29:06 COMPREHENSIVE AND COVERS ALL NECESSARY DETAILS.
21:29:10 
AND I, I GUESS BECAUSE PROFESSIONALLY 
21:29:15 I'M A SOCIAL WORKER, I'M PARTICULARLY GRATEFUL FOR THE ELEMENT THAT PROVIDES 
21:29:18 STRONG SITE COORDINATION AND SOCIAL  SERVICES.
21:29:23 
HELPING OUR NEIGHBORS WORK TOWARD 
21:29:26 PERMANENT HOUSING AND PROVIDING THEM OTHER NEEDED SERVICES.
21:29:29 
AS A MEMBER OF THE FAITH COMMUNITY, 
21:29:31 SISTERS OF THE HOLY FAMILY SUPPORT THIS EFFORT.
21:29:37 
ALTHOUGH WE WILL NOT BE A HOST SITE, 
21:29:40 HOWEVER, WE CAN PARTNER WITH OTHER FAITH COMMUNITIES AND FREMONT 
21:29:42 RESIDENTS TO MAKE THIS WORK.
21:29:46 
SO I AGAIN AM VERY MUCH IN SUPPORT OF 
21:29:49 THIS, AND WE WILL BE THERE TO HELP IN ANY WAY WE CAN.
21:29:50 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
21:29:55 
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU, SISTER.
21:29:57 
NEXT SPEAKER IS ANNIE.
21:29:59 
WELCOME, ANNIE.
21:30:00 
>> THANK YOU.
21:30:02 
I SUPPORT THIS SAFE PARKING PROGRAM 
21:30:03 WHOLEHEARTEDLY.
21:30:06 
WE NEED SYSTEMIC SOLUTIONS TO ADDRESS 
21:30:07 THIS CRISIS.
21:30:09 
I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND THAT.
21:30:12 
AND I WANT A PROGRAM LIKE THIS.
21:30:14 
BUT AS ALWAYS, I URGE OUR CITY TO DO 
21:30:18 EVEN BETTER, BECAUSE WE HAVE THE CAPACITY TO DO SOME REALLY GREAT 
21:30:19 THINGS HERE IN FREMONT.
21:30:22 
SO TO THAT END, I WANTED TO FLAG TWO 
21:30:28 THINGS I NOTICE IN THE SAFE PARKING PROGRAM DETAILS, KNOWING FULL WELL 
21:30:30 THAT SOMETIMES DETAILS CAN EITHER MAKE OR BREAK A PROGRAM.
21:30:33 
ONE, I'M CONCERNED THAT PARTICIPANTS 
21:30:37 MUST MAINTAIN A VALID CALIFORNIA DRIVER'S LICENSE, BECAUSE IT COSTS 
21:30:41 MONEY AND TIME AND RESOURCES TO GET A LICENSE.
21:30:44 
SOME PEOPLE LITERALLY CANNOT GET ONE, 
21:30:50 FOR EXAMPLE, THE SITUATION THAT COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN  OUTLINED, 
21:30:53 WHEREIN DACA RESIDENTS ARE IN ILLEGAL LIMBO.
21:30:59 
HAVING RULES WHICH DENY DACA RESIDENTS 
21:31:03 -- HYPOCRITICAL BECAUSE I BHEEF WE'RE A SANCTUARY CITY HERE IN FREMONT, JUST 
21:31:09 WANT TO POINT THAT OUT, AND IT SEEMS LIKE A PRETTY NEEDLESS BARRIER TO CITY 
21:31:12 SERVICES BECAUSE HAVING A DRIVE'S LICENSE DOESN'T MAKE AN UNHOUSED 
21:31:19 PERSON BETTER OR SAFER OR LESS SAFE  INHERENTLY, AND THERE ARE PLENTY OF 
21:31:22 UNHOUSED FOLKS WITHOUT DRIVER'S LICENSES BUT WITH VEHICLES THAT COULD 
21:31:23 USE THIS PROGRAM.
21:31:25 
SECOND -- SO SECOND THING IS, I'M 
21:31:30 CONCERNED ABOUT THE STIPULATION THAT VEHICLES MUST BE OPERATIONAL.
21:31:32 
KNOWING THAT IT COSTS TIME AND 
21:31:37 RESOURCES AND MONEY TO MAINTAIN A VEHICLE, I'M FAIRLY SURE MOST PEOPLE 
21:31:40 HERE ON THIS MEETING HAVE VEHICLES AND WE KNOW THAT IT TAKES TIME AND 
21:31:42 RESOURCES AND MONEY TO KEEP THEM OPERATIONAL.
21:31:45 
AND THIS IS YET ANOTHER NEEDLESS 
21:31:52 BARRIER WHEREIN OUR POOREST AND MOST IN NEED UNHOUSED PEOPLE MAY BE LEFT OUT 
21:31:53 OF HELP.
21:31:56 
LET'S NOT CREATE A PROGRAM THAT TURNS 
21:32:02 THE MOST IN NEED AWAY WHEN THEY NEED RESOURCES, BUT THEY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH 
21:32:05 EXISTING RESOURCES, NAMELY, THE RESOURCE OF A WORKING VEHICLE TO EVEN 
21:32:06 PARTICIPATE IN OUR PROGRAM.
21:32:10 
SO OF COURSE I URGE YOU TO APPROVE A 
21:32:17 SAFE PARKING PROGRAM, BUT I ALSO URGE YOU TO AMEND THIS CURRENT PROGRAM AND 
21:32:20 THE CURRENT RULES BY CHANGING THE STIPULATIONS BOTH ABOUT DRIVER'S 
21:32:25 LICENSES AND OPERATIONAL  VEHICLES, BECAUSE THESE ARE  NEEDLESS BARRIERS.
21:32:25 
THANK YOU.
21:32:29 
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
21:32:33 
NEXT SPEAKER IS HAYES SHAIR.
21:32:40 
>> DEAR HONORABLE MAYOR MEI, THANK YOU 
21:32:41 VERY MUCH AND MEMBERS OF CITY COUNCIL.
21:32:46 
MY NAME IS HAYES SHAIR, DISTRICT 3, 
21:32:50 AND I'M HERE TO EXPRESS MY SUPPORT FOR THE ORDINANCE BOTH AS A HOMEOWNER AND 
21:32:51 A PARENT WITH YOUNG  CHILDREN.
21:32:53 
STAFF HAS DONE A COMMENDABLE JOB WITH 
21:32:56 DEVELOPING A SET OF CRITERIA THAT ADEQUATELY ADDRESSES PUBLIC SAFETY 
21:33:00 CONCERNS WHILE STILL PROVIDING A SUCCESSFUL PATHWAY TO PERMANENT 
21:33:01 HOUSING FOR THOSE LIVING IN CARS AND RVs.
21:33:04 
WE ARE LUCKY TO HAVE SUCH A DILIGENT 
21:33:04 CITY STAFF.
21:33:07 
I'M ALSO HERE AS THE BENEVOLENCE 
21:33:09 COORDINATOR OF A LOCAL FAITH-BASED STARTUP ORGANIZATION.
21:33:11 
THAT MEANS I FACILITATE CHARITABLE 
21:33:13 GIVING REQUESTS AS THEY COME IN.
21:33:15 
OUR CHURCH HAS PLEDGED TO GIVE BACK 
21:33:19 10% OF OUR ENTIRE TITHES AND OFFERINGS TO ALL THOSE IN NEED IN THE COMMUNITY, 
21:33:24 AND THIS YEAR WE'VE RAISED ABOUT $5,000 IN IN-KIND GOODS FOR THE EXACT TYPE OF 
21:33:25 ITEMS REQUIRED FOR ADMISSION TO A HOST SITE.
21:33:28 
WE ALSO REACHED OUT TO INDIVIDUALS IN 
21:33:31 NEED AND RECENTLY FUNDED CAR REPAIRS FOR AN UNHOUSED PERSON LIVING IN THE 
21:33:32 ISLANDER MOTEL.
21:33:35 
I PROVIDE THESE ONLY BY WAY OF EXAMPLE 
21:33:37 AS A WAY THAT SMALLER FAITH COMMUNITIES, THOSE WITHOUT PARKING 
21:33:40 LOTS, FOR EXAMPLE, CAN PROVIDE SUPPORT.
21:33:42 
THERE ARE MANY OF US OUT THERE, 
21:33:44 FAITH-BASED OR OTHERWISE, AND YOU WILL SEE A STREAM OF SUPPORT ONCE THE 
21:33:46 PROGRAM CAN BE FORMALIZED AND IMPLEMENTED.
21:33:48 
SO IT IS WITH EXTREME ENTHUSIASM THAT 
21:33:53 WE APPLAUD THIS AS A FIRST STEP IN ADDRESSING THE NEEDS OF OUR RV AND CAR 
21:33:53 DWELLERS.
21:33:55 
HOWEVER, WHILE THIS PROGRAM IS INDEED 
21:33:57 A GOOD START, IT IS STILL LIMITED IN SCOPE.
21:34:01 
THEREFORE, I URGE THE COUNCIL TO ALSO 
21:34:05 AUTHORIZE STAFF TO EXPLORE THE OTHER TWO PRONGS OF THE PARKING PROGRAM, 
21:34:08 SANCTIONED STREET PARKING AND CITYWIDE PERMANENT SAFE PARKING LOT.
21:34:10 
UNTIL WE HAVE A CITYWIDE PARKING LOT, 
21:34:12 EVERYTHING ELSE IS A STOPGAP MEASURE.
21:34:17 
OUR GOVERNOR RECENTLY SIGNED A $12 
21:34:20 BILLION BILL ADDRESSING HOMELESSNESS AND WE SHOULD NOT LET THAT OPPORTUNITY 
21:34:20 PASS US BY.
21:34:22 
MUCH LIKE LISA MENTIONED, WE SHOULD 
21:34:27 NOT DELAY IN DEVELOPING A PROGRAM UNTIL WE HAVE COMMITTED FUNDING SOURCE, 
21:34:30 INSTEAD WE SHOULD APPROVE THE PROGRAM, THEN CONDITION THE IMPLEMENTATION ON 
21:34:31 FINDING THE FUNDING.
21:34:34 
MANY OF THESE PROGRAMS REQUIRE US TO 
21:34:37 HAVE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF INFORMATION TO APPLY FOR THE FUND, SO 
21:34:41 IT'S A CHICKEN OR THE EGG ARGUMENT, SO I URGE YOU TO TAKE THAT STRONG STEP 
21:34:41 TODAY.
21:34:42 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
21:34:47 
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
21:34:48 
THE NEXT SPEAKER IS BLAIR BEEKMAN.
21:34:52 
>> HI.
21:34:53 
THANK YOU.
21:34:54 
THANK YOU FOR THIS ITEM.
21:34:57 
I'M A BIT CONFUSED BY IT.
21:35:00 
I MEAN, I'M NOT THE GREATEST TO 
21:35:05 UNDERSTAND THESE SORT OF THINGS, BUT YOU KNOW, IN PREVIOUS COUNCIL MEETINGS 
21:35:12 ABOUT THIS SUBJECT, THINGS WERE VERY LOOSE, AND MAYBE A BIT TOO LOOSE, BUT 
21:35:17 THEY WERE INTERESTING, AND IT MADE FOR AN INTERESTING PROGRAM.
21:35:20 
IT WAS A BIT OUT OF MY LEAGUE, HOW 
21:35:24 LOOSE IT WAS, BUT I WAS YET INTERESTED IN YOUR ATTEMPTS, AND IT SEEMS LIKE 
21:35:28 YOU REALLY  TIGHTENED IT UP AT THIS TIME, SO MUCH SO THAT YOU'VE GONE TOO 
21:35:36 FAR THE OTHER DIRECTION, IT SEEMS LIKE, AND YOU KNOW, IT SOUNDS LIKE THE WAY 
21:35:39 YOU GUYS CAN WORK, YOU CAN ALLOW FOR DIFFERENT THINGS TO TAKE PLACE WITHIN 
21:35:44 THE PROGRAM AND PEOPLE CAN DO THINGS WITHIN IT, BUT YOU MENTIONED HERE 
21:35:50 TONIGHT THAT A REQUIREMENT WILL BE THAT PEOPLE HAVE TO BE WORKING TOWARDS 
21:35:57 PERMANENT HOUSING, AND I'M NOT SO SURE THAT'S THE BEST WAY TO GO.
21:36:00 
I MEAN, MAYBE IT IS, AND I DON'T WANT 
21:36:08 YOU -- I'M A BIT UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THOSE SORT OF WORDS, AND -- BUT I KNOW 
21:36:11 AT THE SAME TIME, YOU CAN MAKE ALLOWANCES AND YOU'LL TRY TO WORK WITH 
21:36:16 PEOPLE SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO FEEL PRESSURED SOMETIMES BUT I THINK THAT 
21:36:23 THE APPROACH OF NON-PRESSURE TO -- ONCE THEY HAVE A SAFE PLACE, THEN YOU CAN 
21:36:29 ASK THEM THE QUESTIONS, DO YOU WANT, DO YOU NEED, HAVE PERMANENT HOUSING, LET 
21:36:32 ME SHOW YOU WHAT GOOD THERE CAN BE IN PERMANENT HOUSING, LET ME SHOW YOU THE 
21:36:38 SERVICES WE CAN OFFER NOW, IF YOU WANT TO BE IN THIS PROGRAM.
21:36:41 
IF YOU TAKE A SOFTER APPROACH, I JUST 
21:36:46 -- I DON'T KNOW HOW -- WHAT THAT BALANCE IS, AND I JUST HATE TO THINK 
21:36:50 THAT THINGS WILL TURN HYPOCRITICAL.
21:36:53 
YOU KNOW, BY THE WAY THAT YOU'LL BE 
21:36:54 CURRENTLY WORKING.
21:36:56 
IT WILL MAKE DEMANDS ON PEOPLE 
21:36:59 SOMETIMES, SOMETIMES PEOPLE CAN GET AWAY WITH STUFF, SOMETIMES PEOPLE 
21:37:00 CAN'T.
21:37:05 
AND IT MAKES FOR A CONFUSING SITUATION.
21:37:06 
I DON'T KNOW.
21:37:09 
I JUST WISH -- IT SEEMED A BIT TOO 
21:37:10 SOFT BEFORE, NOW IT SEEMS A BIT TOO HARD.
21:37:13 
IF YOU CAN LEARN TO SET A REAL -- SET 
21:37:15 STANDARD OF POLICIES THAT ARE SOFTER, THAT'S MY HOPE.
21:37:17 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS, AND 
21:37:20 THAT'S MY ONLY ADVICE FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH.
21:37:25 
AND ABOUT THE SANCTION ENCAMPMENT 
21:37:28 PROCESS, THAT'S A REALLY INTERESTING IDEA, THAT A FEW YEARS AGO, THAT WAS A 
21:37:30 REALLY DIFFICULT SUBJECT FOR CITY GOVERNMENTS.
21:37:33 
I THINK IT'S A LOT EASIER TO 
21:37:33 UNDERSTAND NOW.
21:37:34 
GOOD LUCK IN THAT AREA.
21:37:34 
THANK YOU.
21:37:40 
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU, BLAIR.
21:37:42 
NEXT SPEAKER IS DENISE.
21:37:42 
WELCOME.
21:37:48 
>> GOOD EVENING, COUNCILMEMBERS AND 
21:37:48 MAYOR.
21:37:50 
THANK YOU FOR THIS TIME.
21:37:54 
I WANT TO AGAIN COMMEND THE STAFF FOR 
21:37:54 THIS GREAT WORK.
21:37:57 
I'VE SEEN A LOT OF EFFORTS OVER THE 
21:37:58 LAST THREE YEARS AND IT'S BEEN A LONG ROAD.
21:38:00 
I'M REALLY HAPPY TO HEAR THAT FREMONT 
21:38:06 IS FINALLY GOING TO START TO ADDRESS THESE MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY, 
21:38:10 BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH WE HAVEN'T HAD A PROGRAM -- A FREE PARKING PROGRAM OR A 
21:38:15 PARKING PROGRAM THAT WOULD HELP THEM, THE TRUTH IS, THEY'RE ON OUR CITY 
21:38:16 STREETS RIGHT NOW.
21:38:17 
THEY'RE THERE AND THEY DON'T HAVE THE 
21:38:20 RIGHT FACILITIES TO REALLY HELP THEM.
21:38:24 
THEY ALSO ARE UNSAFE IN THOSE KINDS OF 
21:38:24 COMMUNITIES.
21:38:27 
SO CREATING A PROGRAM LIKE THIS WILL 
21:38:33 NOT ONLY HELP THE LOCAL RESIDENTS IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS, MOVING THESE FOLKS 
21:38:39 OUT AND GIVING THEM ACCESS TO SERVICES THAT THEY NEED, BUT IT WILL ALSO 
21:38:45 PROVIDE THESE INDIVIDUAL RESIDENTS WITH THE HELP THEY NEED, SO I THINK IT 
21:38:49 COMES A LONG WAY AND AS MANY OTHER PEOPLE HAVE MENTIONED, A WAY TO GO.
21:38:52 
I HOPE WE CAN BUILD SOME FLEXIBILITY 
21:38:58 SO THAT WE CAN ALLOW FOR THE INDIVIDUALNESS OF THIS KIND OF 
21:39:03 PROGRAM, BUT AGAIN, I WHOLLY SUPPORT THIS EFFORT AND KNOW IT'S THE 
21:39:07 BEGINNING OF SOMETHING AND WE WILL EVOLVE TO HAVE OTHER PROGRAMS DOWN THE 
21:39:07 ROAD.
21:39:09 
SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND 
21:39:14 ATTENTION, AND I HOPE TO SEE A PERMANENT SOLUTION.
21:39:17 
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU, DENISE.
21:39:19 
FOR YOUR COMMENTS AND FOR ALL THE 
21:39:21 PEOPLE WHO HAVE STAYED WITH US THIS EVENING ON THIS TOPIC.
21:39:25 
I'M GOING TO TURN IT BACK OVER TO OUR 
21:39:31 COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN FOR YOUR COMMENTS AND THEN WE'LL SEE WHERE THE 
21:39:34 DISCUSSION FROM OUR COUNCIL LEADS IN TERMS OF MOVING FORWARD ON THIS.
21:39:35 
WELCOME.
21:39:37 
>> Councilmember Kassan: I HAVE A 
21:39:38 QUESTION AND A COMMENT.
21:39:43 
SO THE QUESTION IS, YOU KNOW, THE 
21:39:51 OTHER SITES THROUGHOUT THE BAY AREA THAT ARE DOING THIS, I THINK I HEARD 
21:39:56 LISA DANZ SAY THAT MOST OF THEM OR MAYBE ALL OF THEM DO NOT REQUIRE 
21:39:56 DRIVER'S LICENSES.
21:40:01 
I WAS WONDERING, WHAT IS NORMAL WITH 
21:40:05 THE OTHER SITE AROUND THE BAY AREA IN TERMS OF THAT REQUIREMENT?
21:40:10 
>> WE'VE ACTUALLY SEEN VARIABILITY 
21:40:14 WITH THAT REQUIREMENT, BOTH THE DRIVER'S LICENSE, THE INSURANCE, AND 
21:40:15 THE REGISTRATION.
21:40:18 
IT CAN VARY BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT 
21:40:20 COMMUNITIES.
21:40:21 
>> Councilmember Kassan: OKAY.
21:40:23 
AND FOR THE ONES THAT DO NOT REQUIRE A 
21:40:30 DRIVER'S LICENSE, ARE WE AWARE WHETHER THAT CAUSES ANY ADDITIONAL PROBLEMS?
21:40:30 
SORRY.
21:40:33 
IS THERE ANY DATA ON WHETHER THAT 
21:40:36 LEADS TO EXTRA PROBLEMS COMPARED TO THE ONES THAT DO REQUIRE THAT?
21:40:40 
>> NO, THERE'S NO INDICATION THAT 
21:40:44 THERE'S A DIFFERENCE IN THE POPULATION OR THE ENVIRONMENT EITHER.
21:40:44 
>> Councilmember Kassan: OKAY.
21:40:49 
SO MY COMMENT IS, I HAVE COME TO KNOW, 
21:40:53 AS A CITY COUNCILMEMBER, I'VE COME TO KNOW THE STAFF OF OUR HUMAN SERVICES 
21:40:57 DEPARTMENT, AND I'M JUST SO INCREDIBLY IMPRESSED WITH THEIR LEVEL OF 
21:41:03 EXPERTISE AND WHAT THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO IMPLEMENT OVER THE YEARS AND THEIR 
21:41:06 KNOWLEDGE, AND I JUST FEEL LIKE I REALLY WOULD LIKE TO TRUST THEM AND 
21:41:12 GIVE THEM SOME FLEXIBILITY AND NOT HAVE -- NOT HAVE -- OBVIOUSLY SOME OF THEIR 
21:41:15 REQUIREMENTS, I THINK WE WANT TO KEEP, BUT SOME OF THEM, I THINK WE NEED TO 
21:41:20 BE MORE FLEXIBLE AND GIVE THE STAFF THE ABILITY TO BEND THE RULES.
21:41:23 
YOU KNOW, WE CAN SAY, FOR EXAMPLE, YOU 
21:41:27 KNOW, WE WILL TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE HAVE DRIVER'S LICENSES BUT IF 
21:41:30 THERE'S A CASE WHERE SOMEONE IS UNDOCUMENTED AND CANNOT HAVE A 
21:41:33 DRIVER'S LICENSE, THAT WE WILL HAVE SOME FLEXIBILITY THERE.
21:41:36 
I JUST -- I REALLY CAN'T  SUPPORT -- 
21:41:41 THINKING ABOUT THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN OUR COUNTRY WHO ARE STUCK IN THE 
21:41:48 IMMIGRATION SYSTEM AND DON'T -- JUST CANNOT GET A DRIVER'S LICENSE NO 
21:41:53 MATTER HOW HARD THEY TRY, I WOULDN'T FEEL COMFORTABLE SUPPORTING SOMETHING 
21:41:56 WHERE THAT WAS A HARD AND FAST RULE, BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE DRIVING ON OUR 
21:42:00 STREETS RIGHT NOW WITH NO DRIVER'S LICENSE BECAUSE OF THAT REASON, SO 
21:42:05 IT'S NOT LIKE, YOU KNOW, THIS WOULD SOMEHOW ATTRACT MORE PEOPLE TO BE 
21:42:05 DOING THAT.
21:42:06 
IT HAPPENING ALREADY.
21:42:11 
SO I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A COUPLE 
21:42:16 CHANGES IN SOME OF THE RULES, ESPECIALLY AROUND THE DRIVER'S LICENSE 
21:42:20 AND THE INSURANCE AND THE REPAIR OF THE CAR SO THAT OUR STAFF ACTUALLY -- WE 
21:42:23 GIVE THE STAFF THE AUTHORITY TO USE THEIR BEST JUDGMENT BECAUSE THEY HAVE 
21:42:27 ALWAYS DEMONSTRATED, AS LONG AS I'VE BEEN A COUNCILMEMBER FROM WHAT I'VE 
21:42:33 SEEN, THEY'VE ALWAYS DEMONSTRATED EXCELLENT JUDGMENT ON MAKING SURE THAT 
21:42:34 THEY ACCOMMODATE TO EACH PARTICULAR SITUATION.
21:42:36 
I THINK US SETTING STRICT RULES, WE'RE 
21:42:40 NOT THE EXPERTS, THEY ARE, SO I JUST -- I WOULD LIKE TO SEE SOME MORE 
21:42:41 FLEXIBILITY FOR OUR STAFF.
21:42:43 
THANK YOU.
21:42:45 
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
21:42:47 
AND I'LL NOW TURN TO COUNCILMEMBER 
21:42:49 JONES FOR YOUR COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS.
21:42:51 
>> Councilmember Jones: THANK YOU, 
21:42:51 MADAME MAYOR.
21:42:57 
SO FOR SUZANNE, JUST REAL QUICKLY, I 
21:43:00 KNOW THE ISSUE COMES UP, YOU KNOW, WHAT DO YOU DO IF THIS PERSON DOESN'T HAVE 
21:43:04 A DRIVER'S LICENSE, ARE THEY STRICTLY PROHIBITED FROM  ENTERING THE PROGRAM.
21:43:07 
HAVE YOU -- HAS ANY OF THE STAFF 
21:43:12 LOOKED AT AB60, WHICH PROVIDES AN AVENUE FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE UNDOCUMENTED 
21:43:19 TO GET A CALIFORNIA DRIVER'S LICENSE AT A VERY, VERY LOW REQUIREMENT LEVEL, I 
21:43:24 MEAN, SUCH AS SCHOOL DOCUMENTS OR EMPLOYMENT DOCUMENTS OR UTILITY BILL, 
21:43:29 THE STATE PASSED THIS LAW BACK IN 2013, IT BEEN VERY, VERY FLEXIBLE IN GETTING 
21:43:34 OUR UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS INTO POSITIONS WHERE THEY CAN DRIVE BECAUSE 
21:43:41 SO MANY OF THEM DO DEPEND ON THAT VEHICLE FOR THEIR DAILY -- THEIR DAILY 
21:43:42 EXISTENCE.
21:43:44 
THAT'S ONE ISSUE.
21:43:47 
I PERSONALLY HAVE AN ISSUE WITH 
21:43:53  SUPERCEDING STATE LAW AND NOT REQUIRING A DRIVE'S LICENSE WHEN WE 
21:43:57 ARE KNOWINGLY GOING TO ALLOW A VEHICLE TO DRIVE OUT OF A PARKING LOT ON TO 
21:44:03 PUBLIC STREETS, I KIND OF STRUGGLE WHERE WE SEE WE HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO 
21:44:05 TELL THE STATE WE'RE NOT GOING TO ENFORCE YOUR LAW.
21:44:07 
SO THAT'S AN ISSUE THERE.
21:44:12 
THE OTHER THING I HAVE IS, WITH THE 
21:44:17 VEHICLE'S ABILITY TO MOVE IN AND OUT, I MEAN, THAT'S THE WHOLE KIND OF CRUX OF 
21:44:20 THIS PROGRAM, IS THAT IT'S AN OVERNIGHT PARKING, IS THAT CORRECT?
21:44:22 
>> Ms.
21:44:24  Shenfil: YES, OF THE ROTATIONAL MODEL, YES.
21:44:27 
BULL A HOST SITE COULD CHOOSE TO ALLOW 
21:44:37  PEOPLE TO STAY AND NOT MOVE ON AND OFF EACH DAY.
21:44:39 
>> Councilmember Jones: THAT'S 
21:44:41 ABSOLUTELY UP TO THE HOST SITE, BUT I THINK ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT THE 
21:44:44 FAITH-BASED COMMUNITY BROUGHT UP IS THEY DO CONDUCT BUSINESS FOR THEIR 
21:44:50 ORGANIZATION DURING THE DAY, AND THEY WILL NEED THEIR PARKING LOTS, BUT 
21:44:53 CERTAINLY IF THEY HAVE THE AVAILABILITY TO DO THAT, THAT'S UP TO THEM.
21:44:58 
BUT I LIKE THE IDEA OF -- I  MEAN, 
21:45:01 EVERYTHING YOU GUYS HAVE DONE, YOU TOOK THE INPUT FROM THE MEETING WE HAD ON 
21:45:05 JUNE 1ST AND YOU REALLY BROUGHT FORWARD A LOT OF GOOD RECOMMENDATIONS.
21:45:12 
I REALLY LIKE THE IDEA THAT  HAYES 
21:45:19 SHAIR MENTIONED, AND THAT IS THAT COMMUNITY FUND, I THINK THAT'S GOING 
21:45:20 TO BE KIND OF CRITICAL TO OUR SUCCESS.
21:45:23 
THE BIGGEST ISSUE IS BEING ABLE TO 
21:45:26 KEEP THE VEHICLES RUNNING AND IN GOOD REPAIR.
21:45:28 
THE OBTAINING OF A DRIVER'S LICENSE 
21:45:33 AND INSURANCE, AND THE INSURANCE NOT ONLY PROTECTS THE PARTICIPANT IN THE 
21:45:37 PROGRAM, IT PROTECTS ALL OF OUR COMMUNITY RESIDENTS WHEN THAT 
21:45:41 PARTICIPANT HAS TO LEAVE THE FACILITY AND GO OUT ON TO THE CITY STREETS 
21:45:42 DURING THE DAY.
21:45:45 
SO IT'S -- YOU KNOW, IT KIND OF WORKS 
21:45:47 IN BOTH OF THEM'S FAVOR.
21:45:50 
BUT OVERALL, I LIKE THE  PROGRAM'S 
21:45:51 DIRECTION.
21:45:54 
IF WE HAD ENDLESS BUCKETS OF MONEY, 
21:45:57 I'M SURE WE WOULD BE ABLE TO DO MORE AND THEN MAYBE WE CAN GET A BIG CHUNK 
21:46:02 OF THE $12 BILLION THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS RECENTLY APPROVED, BUT SO FAR I 
21:46:05 LIKE WHAT I SEE AND I'M WHOLLY IN FAVOR OF THIS RECOMMENDATION.
21:46:10 
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
21:46:11 
VICE MAYOR SHAO.
21:46:13 
>> Vice Mayor Shao: THANK YOU, MAYOR.
21:46:18 
I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO SEE THAT WE STICK 
21:46:25 TO THE REQUIREMENT THAT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THEY HAVE THE DRIVER'S LICENSE.
21:46:27 
MY UNDERSTANDING FROM THE HUMAN 
21:46:32 SERVICES DEPARTMENT IN THE PAST IS THAT ALL THOSE PEOPLE THAT COME FROM 
21:46:38 FREMONT, LIVE IN THEIR CARS, 90% OF THEM HAVE WORK, THEY'RE NOT PENNILESS, 
21:46:41 THEY HAVE INCOME, THEY JUST DON'T HAVE A PERMANENT ROOF OVER THEIR HEAD.
21:46:46 
THEY'RE ON THEIR WAY TO GO BACK TO THE 
21:46:47 PERMANENT HOUSING.
21:46:51 
SO THEREFORE, FIRST OF ALL, I BELIEVE 
21:47:00 IF THEY ARE LACKING, WE CAN COME UP WITH SOME SPECIAL FUND TO HELP THEM 
21:47:02 PAY FOR THE DRIVER'S LICENSE FEE.
21:47:08 
SECONDLY, I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD 
21:47:16 ENDORSE ANY DRIVERLESS LICENSELESS DRIVERS DRIVING ON THE STREET AS A 
21:47:19 CITY GOVERNMENT, BECAUSE IT'S ALSO A LIABILITY.
21:47:23 
IF SOMEONE, LET'S JUST SAY WAS DRIVING 
21:47:31 OUT OF THAT PARKING LOT, GOT INTO A CAR ACCIDENT WITH A PEDESTRIAN AND THE 
21:47:36 VICTIM FOUND OUT THAT WE KNOWINGLY, WE KNOWINGLY ALLOW THAT PERSON TO USE 
21:47:46 THAT SITE, AND THEN USE OUR STREET IN THE CITY, AND GET INTO THAT KIND OF 
21:47:50 CAR ACCIDENT, THEN THE CITY SHOULD HAVE SOME LIABILITY.
21:47:52 
THAT'S WHAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT.
21:47:59 
SO I AGREE WITH COUNCILMEMBER JONES 
21:48:03 THAT WE NEED TO STICK TO OUR ORIGINAL REQUIREMENT FOR THE DRIVER'S LICENSE.
21:48:05 
IN ADDITION, I BELIEVE A DRIVER'S 
21:48:10 LICENSE IS ALSO A WAY THAT WE CAN CONFIRM THEY'RE, INDEED, FROM THE 
21:48:12 TRI-CITIES, NOT FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE.
21:48:15 
BECAUSE BASED ON THEIR REGISTRATION 
21:48:16 ADDRESS, CORRECT?
21:48:20 
SO THAT IS ANOTHER PROOF THAT THEY DO 
21:48:21 COME FROM OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.
21:48:25 
AS I SAID, THE REASON I SUPPORT THIS 
21:48:35 PROGRAM IS BECAUSE IT STARTS TO HELP OUR LOCAL NEEDY PEOPLE, AND INSTEAD OF 
21:48:40  INVITING ALL THE NEEDY PEOPLE FROM THE STATE TO COME TO FREMONT, WE DON'T 
21:48:45 HAVE THAT KIND OF  CAPACITY, WE DON'T HAVE THAT KIND OF RESOURCES, BUT WE 
21:48:50 NEED TO WORK TOGETHER TO HELP OUR NEIGHBORS, WHICH MEANS THAT THEY ARE 
21:48:55 INDEED FROM FREMONT, UNION CITY, AND NEWARK.
21:49:00 
SO WITH THAT, I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT 
21:49:04 THE ORIGINAL REQUIREMENT FOR DRIVER'S LICENSE STAY.
21:49:05 
THANK YOU.
21:49:07 
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
21:49:10 
I WANTED TO ALSO BE RESPECTFUL TO SEE 
21:49:15 IF OUR OTHER COUNCILMEMBERS I HAVE NOT HEARD FROM, COUNCILMEMBER KENG YET OR 
21:49:16 COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN.
21:49:21 
COUNCILMEMBER KENG, IF YOU'D LIKE TO 
21:49:23 GO FIRST.
21:49:25 
I'M SORRY, YOU'RE ON MUTE.
21:49:32 
>> Councilmember Keng: THANK  YOU, 
21:49:33 MAYOR MEI.
21:49:38 
I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO SUPPORT OUR 
21:49:43 HOMELESSNESS POPULATION AS IT CONTINUES -- AS HOMELESSNESS CONTINUES TO  
21:49:47 WORSEN, ESPECIALLY DURING THE PANDEMIC, AND I'M GLAD TO SEE SOME OF THE 
21:49:51 GUIDELINES HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED AND PRIORITIES ARE BEING SET.
21:49:54 
I THINK THAT IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE 
21:50:01 SET SOME OF THESE GUIDELINES TO BE ACCOUNTABLE TO THE HOST SITES, AND -- 
21:50:07 ACCOUNTABLE TO THE HOST SITES AND TO REDUCE THEIR LIABILITY, SO I DO THINK 
21:50:17 THAT WE DO WANT TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO GET LICENSED AS WELL AS CARRYING THEIR 
21:50:24 CAR INSURANCE, AND I LIKE THAT THERE IS A GRACE PERIOD IF NEEDED, MAYBE WE CAN 
21:50:29 GIVE THEM A LITTLE LONGER TIME AS SOMETIMES IT COULD TAKE A WHILE, I 
21:50:34 KNOW, SO IF -- PROVIDE THE FUNDING THAT WE WOULD NEED.
21:50:37 
I ALSO -- I DO HAVE A QUICK QUESTION 
21:50:38 FOR THE STAFF.
21:50:42 
WHAT IS THE TOTAL BUDGETED FUNDING FOR 
21:50:43 THIS PROGRAM?
21:50:47 
AND ALSO, HOW MUCH FUNDING CAN BE 
21:50:50 DIRECTED FROM NEWARK AND UNION CITY?
21:50:50 
THANK YOU.
21:50:53 
>> Ms.
21:51:00  Shenfil: RIGHT NOW WE HAVE APPROXIMATELY $340,000 SET ASIDE TO BE 
21:51:05 USED FOR SAFE PARKING, AND WE'RE NOT LOOKING TO HAVE OUR NEIGHBORING CITIES 
21:51:08  MAKE A FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTION AT THIS POINT.
21:51:12 
THEY'VE CONTRIBUTED BY TAKING OUR 
21:51:17 FAMILIES INTO THEIR CARAVAN PROGRAM OR BY, IN THE CASE OF NEWARK, MAKING 
21:51:19 CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR HOMELESS EFFORTS.
21:51:21 
ON A TRI-CITY BASIS.
21:51:25 
>> Councilmember Keng: OKAY, THANK 
21:51:25 YOU, SUZANNE.
21:51:28 
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
21:51:32 
I SEE COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN, YOUR HAND 
21:51:32 IS RAISED.
21:51:33 
THANK YOU.
21:51:34 
>> Councilmember Salwan: YES, MADAME 
21:51:35 MAYOR.
21:51:38 
YES, I THINK THIS IS -- STAFF HAS DONE 
21:51:42 THE WORK AND TAKEN THE FEEDBACK FROM THE COUNCIL, AND TRIED TO COME UP WITH 
21:51:43 SOMETHING THAT WORKS FOR MOST OF US.
21:51:49 
THE ISSUE ABOUT LICENSE, I CAN BE 
21:51:50 PERSUADED EITHER WAY.
21:51:54 
BUT I DO FEEL THAT FOR THE MOST PART, 
21:51:57 PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO GET A LICENSE NOWADAYS.
21:52:00 
BUT I'M NOT NECESSARILY TIED TO THAT.
21:52:02 
BUT I THINK WE SHOULD ENCOURAGE PEOPLE 
21:52:04 TO GET LICENSED AND HAVE INSURANCE.
21:52:06 
SO WITH THAT, I'M WILLING TO GO AHEAD 
21:52:10 AND SUPPORT THIS, AND YOU KNOW, I MOVE THIS FORWARD SO WE CAN GET THIS GOING.
21:52:10 
THANK YOU.
21:52:12 
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
21:52:15 
I SEE A HAND RAISED BY COUNCILMEMBER 
21:52:15 KASSAN AND COUNCILMEMBER JONES.
21:52:18 
SO COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, JONES, AND I 
21:52:19 HAVE SOME COMMENTS TOO.
21:52:20 
THANK YOU.
21:52:21 
>> Councilmember Kassan: I REALLY 
21:52:23 LIKED WHAT COUNCILMEMBER KENG SAID ABOUT A GRACE PERIOD.
21:52:26 
I THINK THAT'S A REALLY REASONABLE 
21:52:26 COMPROMISE.
21:52:29 
I THINK IT MAKES TOTAL SENSE TO 
21:52:33 ENCOURAGE IT BUT THE WAY IT'S WRITTEN NOW, I THINK IT WOULD KIND OF -- I 
21:52:37 DON'T SEE HOW WE COULD HELP SOMEONE GET THESE THINGS IF THEY'RE NOT ALLOWED TO 
21:52:39 AT LEAST BE IN THE PROGRAM.
21:52:41 
SO I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A FRIENDLY 
21:52:49 AMENDMENT TO THE RESOLUTION THAT WE ADD TO THE RULES THAT CITY STAFF HAVE 
21:52:58 AUTHORITY TO PROVIDE A GRACE PERIOD TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE FOR PEOPLE TO BE 
21:53:02 ABLE TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF HAVING THE OPERATIONAL VEHICLE, THE 
21:53:10 INSURANCE, AND THE DRIVER'S LICENSE THAT THEY WOULD USE THEIR BEST 
21:53:13 JUDGMENT, IF THERE'S A PATHWAY FOR THEM GETTING IT AND THEY CAN GET IT, THAT 
21:53:18 THEY HAVE TIME TO HELP PEOPLE DO  THAT, AND WE TRUST THEM THAT THEY WILL USE 
21:53:18 GOOD JUDGMENT ON THAT.
21:53:23 
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
21:53:23 
COUNCILMEMBER JONES.
21:53:26 
>> Councilmember Jones: THANK YOU, 
21:53:26 MADAME MAYOR.
21:53:29 
SO COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, I BELIEVE, 
21:53:33 AND SUZANNE, CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG, BUT THERE IS A 45 DAY GRACE PERIOD 
21:53:35 BUILT INTO THE DOCUMENT ALREADY, IS THAT CORRECT?
21:53:36 
>> Ms.
21:53:39  Shenfil: RIGHT, THAT PEOPLE COME ON TO THE SITE CONDITIONALLY AND WE WOULD 
21:53:40 WORK WITH THEM.
21:53:42 
>> Councilmember Jones: OKAY.
21:53:43 
>> Councilmember Kassan: I'M SO SORRY, 
21:53:44 I MISSED THAT.
21:53:45 
>> Councilmember Jones: THAT'S OKAY.
21:53:47 
I JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY THAT SO THAT 
21:53:48 WE COULD JUST KEEP THIS A LITTLE BIT CLEANER.
21:53:51 
YOU KNOW, WITH ANY PROGRAM, THERE'S 
21:53:57 GOING TO BE CHANGE AS WE GO ALONG AND AS WE LEARN WHAT THE NEEDS ARE AND 
21:54:03 WHAT OUR CAPACITY IS TO SUPPORT THESE PROGRAMS, BUT AGAIN, I AM VERY MUCH IN 
21:54:06 FAVOR, AND IF NOBODY ELSE HAS ANY COMMENTS, I WOULD MOVE TO APPROVE THE 
21:54:06 PROGRAM.
21:54:09 
>> Councilmember Salwan: I SECOND.
21:54:09 
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY.
21:54:11 
WELL, WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND.
21:54:13 
I JUST HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO GIVE MY COMMENT.
21:54:14 
I'LL JUST BEING QUICK ON THIS.
21:54:16 
I'LL SAY THAT I FEEL LIKE GOLDILOCKS 
21:54:22 AND THE THREE BEARS A LITTLE BIT, SOME THINGS TOO  HARD, SOMETHING TOO SOFT, 
21:54:23 SOME THINGS JUST RIGHT.
21:54:25 
I'D RATHER US MOVE FORWARD.
21:54:26 
I HAVE PARTICIPATED IN SOME OF THE 
21:54:29 TALKS WITH OUR FAITH-BASED COMMUNITY MEMBERS, AND HAVING BEEN THROUGH THE 
21:54:34 NAVIGATION CENTER DISCUSSION, AND HAVING THE OPPORTUNITY TO VISIT 
21:54:39 MULTIPLE SITES BOTH HERE AND FREMONT AND ELSEWHERE THROUGHOUT OTHER CITIES.
21:54:43 
I AM HAPPY TO SEE THAT WE'RE GOING TO 
21:54:44 BE MOVING FORWARD.
21:54:46 
AND THIS DOES NOT SOLVE THE OTHER 
21:54:49 PROBLEMS, I WOULD LIKE TO EVENTUALLY MOVE FORWARD WITH THE OTHER TWO 
21:54:52 OPTIONS, BUT WE ARE MOVING FORWARD WITH THIS OPTION TONIGHT, AND I ABSOLUTELY 
21:54:57 WILL TELL YOU THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE FIGHTING FOR A PIECE OF THAT $12 
21:55:06 BILLION AND THAT HAS ALREADY STARTED ON THE REGULAR MEETINGS, ALAMEDA COUNTY 
21:55:10 MAYORS' CONFERENCE, I WANT TO THANK LAURIE AND SUZANNE FOR PARTNERING WITH 
21:55:19 ME ON A MONTHLY BASIS, DISCUSSING HOW FUNDING WILL COME FROM THE COUNTY, 
21:55:22 FROM THE LEGISLATION AND FROM THE STATE, AND WE ARE FIGHTING AND 
21:55:25 ADVOCATING ABSOLUTELY 100% FOR FREMONT TO GET A PIECE OF THAT.
21:55:27 
THERE'S NO DOUBT IN MY MIND WE WILL 
21:55:29 GET OUR SHARE AND WE WILL DO OUR BEST TO DO SO.
21:55:31 
SO SEEING THAT WE HAVE A MOTION AND A 
21:55:35 SECOND, MOTION BY COUNCILMEMBER JONES AND SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER SHAO, 
21:55:40 MAY I HAVE A -- OH, COUNCILMEMBER COX, DO YOU HAVE A FRIENDLY AMENDMENT OR 
21:55:41 --
>> Councilmember Cox: I JUST HAD A 
21:55:42 QUICK QUESTION.
21:55:45 
FOR SOME OF THE AREAS THAT HAVE 
21:55:51 PARKING RIGHT NOW, DOES THAT MEAN THAT THERE WILL BE SOME WAY OF CLEANING UP 
21:55:59 THE AREAS THAT HAVE PARKING ON THE SIDES, LIKE NILES CANYON AREA OR 
21:56:00 AUBREY WITH THIS TYPE OF PROGRAM?
21:56:06 
>> Mayor Mei: I DON'T KNOW IF STAFF 
21:56:10  WANTS TO MENTION, I THINK PART OF IT COMES FROM OUR DISCUSSION EARLIER THIS 
21:56:14 EVENING THAT AT THIS POINT RIGHT NOW, WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF EVICTION 
21:56:18 MORATORIUM AND WE HAVE BEEN RESTRICTED FROM CERTAIN AREAS OF ABATEMENT, AND I 
21:56:22 DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S CORRECT, AND PLEASE FEEL FREE FOR STAFF TO CORRECT 
21:56:26 ME IF I'M WRONG BUT THAT IS ONE OF OUR GREATER CHALLENGES AT THIS POINT.
21:56:26 
>> Ms.
21:56:29  Shenfil: THAT IS OUR CHALLENGE, BUT THROUGH ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES, WE 
21:56:36 HAVE AN ONGOING PROGRAM WHERE WE TAG AND ABATE AREAS IN TERMS OF CLEAN-UP 
21:56:41 FOR HEALTH AND SAFETY REASONS?
21:56:42 
>> Councilmember Cox: NO, I'M 
21:56:45 REFERRING TO THE PARKED CARS THAT ARE ON THE STREET RIGHT  NOW, HOW DOES 
21:56:47 THAT WORK WITH THIS TYPE OF PROGRAM THAT ARE OUT THERE RIGHT NOW?
21:56:53 
>> Ms.
21:56:58  Shenfil: IF THEY MEET THE ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR THE PROGRAM, THEY WILL, 
21:56:59 YOU KNOW -- CAN BE PARTICIPANTS.
21:57:03 
>> Councilmember Cox: THAT'S FOR HOST 
21:57:06 SITES, BUT IS IT ALSO FOR PUBLIC SITES AS WELL?
21:57:08 
THAT'S THE PART I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
21:57:11 
>> City Manager Danaj: SO I WOULD SAY 
21:57:13 THAT THEY'RE RELATED AND UNRELATED.
21:57:15 
IT'S UNRELATED IN THE SENSE THAT WE DO 
21:57:20 HAVE AN ABATEMENT PROGRAM, SO WE WILL ACTIVELY GO, ESPECIALLY FOR HEALTH 
21:57:25 ISSUES, AND ABATE ANYWHERE PUBLICLY, ALBEIT IT'S ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS, 
21:57:31 IT'S A BIT OF A ROLLING PROGRAM, WE DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TO JUST DO 
21:57:31 THE WHOLE CITY AT ONCE.
21:57:35 
SO IN THAT SENSE -- BUT IT'S ALSO 
21:57:43 RELATED THAT OUR ABILITY TO DO ABATEMENTS, LEGALLY DO IT, IS ENHANCED 
21:57:45 BY HAVING A SAFE PARKING PROGRAM BECAUSE WE DO HAVE OPTIONS TO SEND 
21:57:51 PEOPLE TO PLACES AND THAT'S LEGALLY GIVING US THE AUTHORITY TO ABATE 
21:57:52 PUBLIC HEALTH HAZARDS.
21:57:54 
SO IT'S ALSO RELATED.
21:57:55 
SO IT'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION.
21:57:58 
>> Mayor Mei: I ALSO --

21:58:01 >> Councilmember Cox: I'M NOT TOTALLY CLEAR ON THAT, BECAUSE IF WE HAVE 
21:58:05 EXISTING SITES THAT ARE PARKED RIGHT NOW, AND WE CHANGE THE ZONING TO HAVE 
21:58:11 PUBLIC SITES, THEN THAT MEANS THE VEHICLES THAT ARE OUT THERE RIGHT NOW 
21:58:16 WOULD NOT BE  SUBJECT -- OR WOULD BE SUBJECT TO THE SAFE PARKING PROGRAM  
21:58:18 OR -- I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THAT PART.
21:58:20 
>> City Manager Danaj: THIS IS A GOOD 
21:58:21 CONVERSATION,  COUNCILMEMBER.
21:58:24 
I'LL LET THE STAFF CORRECT ME, BUT 
21:58:28 JUST BECAUSE WE HAVE A SAFE PARKING PROGRAM -- WELL, THE SAFE PARKING 
21:58:31 PROGRAM THAT'S BEING PROPOSED, AND IT WAS ESTABLISHED BY THE COUNCIL 
21:58:36 EARLIER, AND NOW WITH ITS CRITERIA, IS NOT OBLIGATORY.
21:58:38 
SO IT'S A VOLUNTARY PROCESS BY WHICH 
21:58:38 PEOPLE COME IN.
21:58:42 
I'M JUST SIMPLY ADDING THE ADDED 
21:58:49 BENEFIT OF BEING A CITY THAT WILL NOW HAVE A PROGRAM LIKE THIS, SAFE 
21:58:53 PARKING, MEANS IT GIVES A MORE LEGAL STANDING TO DO SOME OF THE ABATEMENT 
21:58:56 THAT WE DO, BECAUSE RECENTLY THE COURTS HAVE BEEN RULING THAT  HOMELESSNESS 
21:59:00 ESSENTIALLY ISN'T A CRIME AND YOU CAN'T MOVE PEOPLE UNLESS THERE'S A PLACE FOR 
21:59:00 THEM TO GO.
21:59:02 
SO I JUST WANTED TO ADD THAT 
21:59:04 ADDITIONAL CONTEXT.
21:59:07 
AND I'D INVITE THE STAFF TO ADD OR 
21:59:08 SUBTRACT FROM WHAT I JUST SAID.
21:59:10 
>> Ms.
21:59:12  Shenfil: I THINK YOU DID A GOOD JOB, MARK.
21:59:15 
>> Mayor Mei: COUNCILMEMBER SHAO, DID 
21:59:17 YOU HAVE A CLARIFYING QUESTION ON THIS ALSO?
21:59:19 
>> Vice Mayor Shao: NO, I JUST WANT TO 
21:59:20 MAKE A MINOR CORRECTION.
21:59:22 
THIS MOTION WAS SECONDED BY 
21:59:24 COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN INSTEAD OF ME.
21:59:25 
>> Mayor Mei: OH, OKAY.
21:59:26 
THANK YOU.
21:59:27 
I APPRECIATE THE CLARIFICATION.
21:59:30 
I THINK IT'S GETTING LATER IN THIS EVENING.
21:59:33 
BUT I WANTED TO CLARIFY ALSO, I THINK 
21:59:36 REGARDING YOUR QUESTION, COUNCILMEMBER COX, AND SOME OF THE PUBLIC SPEAKERS 
21:59:41 EARLIER, ONE OF OUR CHALLENGES ALSO IF THE PROPERTY HAS TO BE SOMETHING 
21:59:45 THAT'S OUR -- ACCESSED.
21:59:46 
SO SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT HAVE 
21:59:50 COME UP, DEPENDING ON WHERE IT IS, FOR EXAMPLE, IF IT'S IN UNION PACIFIC OR 
21:59:53 IF IT'S ON PRIVATE PROPERTY, WE CANNOT ENTER SOMEONE ELSE'S PRIVATE 
21:59:58 PROPERTIES TO MOVE PEOPLE OR LIKE IF IT'S A RIGHT-OF-WAY THAT BELONGS TO 
22:00:01 ANOTHER AGENCY, THAT TOO, ALSO, IS RESTRICTIVE.
22:00:05 
SO --

22:00:12 >> Councilmember Cox: SO  PATHWAYS ALONG THE FREEWAY IN OUR JURISDICTION, 
22:00:13 LIKE AUBREY, IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING?
22:00:16 
I'M TRYING TO USE THAT AS AN EXAMPLE.
22:00:17 
THE PERSON THAT SPOKE FROM LIGHTHOUSE, 
22:00:22 WHERE THEY HAD THE KATO ROAD, I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHERE OUR 
22:00:29 JURISDICTION BEGINS AND WHERE IT ENDS FOR SAFE PARKING AND ON SAFE PARKING 
22:00:31 ON PUBLIC SITES.
22:00:33 
>> Councilmember Jones: MAYOR MEI, IF 
22:00:37 I CAN JUST OFFER A COMMENT, THE NINTH CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS HAS RULED 
22:00:43 THAT PUBLIC AGENCIES MAY NOT REMOVE ANY  HOMELESS PERSON FROM PUBLIC PROPERTY 
22:00:44 UNLESS YOU CAN PROVIDE THEM A PLACE OF SHELTER.
22:00:48 
AND IF WE DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH SPACE 
22:00:54 AVAILABLE, THEN WE ARE PROHIBITED BY THE CIRCUIT'S DECISION FROM REMOVING 
22:01:00 ANYONE FROM ANY PUBLIC PROPERTY, SO STREETS, PARKS, DMV, COURTHOUSE, ANY 
22:01:07 OF THOSE KINDS OF THINGS, ANYTHING FUNDED BY CITY, COUNTY, STATE OR SO 
22:01:10 UNTIL THAT RESTRICTION LIFTS OR UNTIL I.T.
22:01:16  GETS CHALLENGED IT MAKES IT VERY, VERY DIFFICULT FOR ENFORCEMENT OF ABATING 
22:01:18 VEHICLES AND-OR PROPERTY.
22:01:20 
>> Mayor Mei:   SO WE HAVE A NOAKS.
22:01:26  MOTION AND SECOND.
22:01:28 
I'LL CALL DID QUESTION ON THIS.
22:01:31 
>> The Clerk:   COUNCILMEMBER COX.
22:01:32 
NO.
22:01:35 
>> The Clerk:   COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN 
22:01:37 YES.
22:01:41 
COUNCILMEMBER JONES, YES.
22:01:42 
COUNCILMEMBER KENG.
22:01:43 
YES.
22:01:47 
VICE MAYOR SHAO, AYE.
22:01:49 
MAYOR MEI.
22:01:49 
AYE.
22:01:56 
>> Mayor Mei:   THIS MOTION  PASSES 
22:01:59 6-1, WITH ONE NAY, COUNCILMEMBER COX.

WE WANTED TO THANK EVERYONE FOR THEIR 
22:02:02 COMMENTS THIS EVENING.
22:02:05 
I WANTED TO AGAIN SHARE MY 
22:02:07 APPRECIATION TO ALL THOSE WHO ARE ADDRESSING THE FIRES THROUGHOUT THE 
22:02:08 COMMUNITY.
22:02:10 
AND THAT WE HAVE SEVERAL STRIKE TEAMS 
22:02:11 OUT THERE.
22:02:13 
AND I THANK EVERYONE FOR COMING THIS 
22:02:13 EVENING.
22:02:16 
THIS IS THE FIRST OF MANY STEPS AND WE 
22:02:20 HAVE MANY ISSUES THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE ADDRESSING WHETHER IT'S THE SAFE 
22:02:27 PARKING HOMELESSNESS ABATEMENT AND WE WORK CLOSELY WITH OUR COMMUNITY AND 
22:02:30 LOOK
FORWARD TO THE  CONTINUED CONVERSATION 
22:02:35 AND APPRECIATE STAFF'S SUPPORT AS WELL AS THOSE OF OUR NEIGHBORING CITIES IN 
22:02:36 PARTNERING ON THIS.
22:02:39 
BECAUSE IT IS TRULY NOT ONE THAT WE 
22:02:49 CAN ADDRESS SINGULARLY, I'M ALSO LOOKING FORWARD TO THE STATE FUNDING 
22:02:52 AND OTHER OPPORTUNITIES TO SECURE YOU  THIS.
22:02:55 
AND IF THERE ARE ONES WHO COULD GIVE 
22:02:59 THERE IS A LIST I WANTED TO NOTE FOR OUR SHELTER AND OUR NAVIGATION CENTER 
22:03:04 THAT IS OUT THERE THAT WAS UPDATED FOR THE SUMMER AND I ENCOURAGE PEOPLE THE 
22:03:06 STEP UP
WHETHER IT'S THROUGH THIS PROGRAM OR
