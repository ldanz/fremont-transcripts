 GOING TO CALL ON KELLY ABREU FIRST FOR ORAL COMMUNICATIONS.
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY.


[Captioner] 19:07:33
WELCOME, KELLY.


[Captioner] 19:07:40
>> IN CASTRO VALLEY THEY HAVE SOMETHING CALLED THE HAYWARD AREA RECREATION

[Captioner] 19:07:45
 DISTRICT AND THEY DO PARKS AND THEY ALSO HAVE SOMETHING THAT'S KIND OF LIKE A CITY

[Captioner] 19:07:50
 COUNCIL SO YESTERDAY OR -- THEY HAD A STATE OF THE PARKS PRESENTATION

[Captioner] 19:07:56
 AND UPDATE BY THE RECREATION AND PARK DISTRICT.


[Captioner] 19:08:02
AND THE CITY OF FREMONT HAS SOMETHING SIMILAR.
IT HAS

[Captioner] 19:08:07
 THE EBRPB CITY LIAISON COMMITTEE THAT IS SUPPOSED TO MEET THREE TIMES A

[Captioner] 19:08:12
 YEAR.
THREE TIMES A YEAR.
NOW, IT MET TWICE

[Captioner] 19:08:18
 IN 2016 AND 2017, AND 2018, AND

[Captioner] 19:08:24
 2021, BUT IN 2019, IT MET JUST ONCE, JUST ONCE IN 2020, JUST

[Captioner] 19:08:30
 ONCE IN 2022, AND IT MET ON APRIL 27TH

[Captioner] 19:08:35
 OF 2023.
THAT'S ONCE.
SO

[Captioner] 19:08:41
 IT SOUNDS LIKE A COUPLE YEARS OF ONCE AND A COUPLE YEARS OF TWICE THAT AVERAGES OUT TO WHAT, 1 1/2?


[Captioner] 19:08:46
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE THREE.
AND YOU KNOW, IF YOU ASK, WELL, WHAT ARE THE ISSUES, WELL, MAYBE

[Captioner] 19:08:52
 YOU SHOULD LIKE TURN ON -- LOOK AT THE SACRAMENTO BEE.
THEY COVERED THE STORY,

[Captioner] 19:08:57
 THE BIG NEWS.


[Captioner] 19:09:02
THE DESTRUCTION OF THE POLE AT MISSION PEAK.
HOW ABOUT

[Captioner] 19:09:07
 CROWN 4 BAY AREA NEWS, HOW ABOUT "SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE," HOW ABOUT THE SAN JOSÉ MERCURY?


[Captioner] 19:09:12
I COULD GIVE YOU A WHOLE LIST OF ARTICLES ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE PARK OVER

[Captioner] 19:09:18
 THERE, AND YOU WOULD THINK THAT THE POLITICIANS WOULD BE INTEREST

[Captioner] 19:09:24
ED, EVEN THE CITY POLITICIANS SEEM TO HAVE AN INTEREST IN MISSION PEAK WHEN IT'S TIME TO

[Captioner] 19:09:29
 RESTRICT PARKING, WHEN IT'S TIME TO CUT PARK HOURS, WHEN IT'S TIME TO LIMIT HOW MANY

[Captioner] 19:09:35
 RESTROOMS WE BUILD.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:09:44
>> Ms. Gauthier: THE NEXT SPEAKER IS SURESH.


[Captioner] 19:09:47
>> HI.
CAN YOU HEAR ME?
>> Ms. Gauthier: YES.


[Captioner] 19:09:53
>> Mayor Mei: YES.
>> 10 DAYS AGO, THE MISSION

[Captioner] 19:09:58
  PEAK -- AT THE SUMMIT OF MISSION PEAK WAS SLICED IN HALF AND TOSSED 200 FEET DOWN

[Captioner] 19:10:03
 THE SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN.
THE CITY COUNCIL HAS BEEN EERILY SILENT ON THIS

[Captioner] 19:10:08
 ACT OF VANDALISM, WHERE THE COUNCIL HAS HAD MANY, MANY LONG

[Captioner] 19:10:13
 AND LIVELY DEBATES REGARDING ACCESS TO MISSION PEAK.
BACK IN NOVEMBER 2021,

[Captioner] 19:10:19
 A COUNCILMEMBER MADE THE FOLLOWING STATEMENT ABOUT THE POLE:  IMAGINE IF WE HAD THAT

[Captioner] 19:10:24
 RIGHT ON MISSION BOULEVARD.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO CLIMB THE PEAK.
WELL, IT SEEMS

[Captioner] 19:10:29
 THAT PHASE ONE OF OPERATION MISSION PEAK HAS BEEN SUCCESSFULLY EXECUTED.


[Captioner] 19:10:35
WE ARE NOW WAITING TO FIND OUT WHEN AND WHERE THE POLE WILL BE

[Captioner] 19:10:40
 REINSTALLED ON MISSION BOULEVARD SO THAT AS THE COUNCILMEMBER SUGGESTED IN

[Captioner] 19:10:45
 2021, YOU DON'T HAVE TO CLIMB THE PEAK.
YOU COULD JUST TAKE THE PHOTO RIGHT 

[Captioner] 19:10:51
THERE AND THEN INVITE THEM FOR THE EXPERIENCE.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:11:02
>> Ms. Gauthier: THERE'S NO ADDITIONAL SPEAKERS.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.


[Captioner] 19:11:09
I KNOW THIS IS NOT AN AGENDIZED ITEM BUT I KNOW THAT OUR CITY STAFF HAS BEEN WORKING

[Captioner] 19:11:14
 IN CONCERT WITH THE EAST BAY REGIONAL PARKS WHO OWNS MISSION PEAK, AND SO I JUST WANTED TO LEAVE IT

[Captioner] 19:11:19
 AT THAT, AND THEY WILL BE SHARING AN UPDATE AS THEY WORK IN CONCERT.
CERTAINLY

[Captioner] 19:11:24
 ALL OF US AS COMMUNITY MEMBERS ARE SAD WHENEVER THERE IS VANDALISM OF ANY FACILITIES IN

[Captioner] 19:11:29
 OUR CITY, BE IT PARK OR OTHER CITY FACILITIES.
AND THIS IS CERTAINLY ONE THAT'S WELL 

[Captioner] 19:11:34
LOVED AND WELL RECOGNIZED IN OUR COMMUNITY.
AND SO THANK YOU FOR ALL THE

[Captioner] 19:11:39
 CARE FROM THE COMMUNITY MEMBERS WHO HAVE SPENT TIME RECREATING IN OUR CITY, AND THANK YOU FOR THE

[Captioner] 19:11:43
 CONTINUED INTEREST AND WORKING IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE EAST BAY REGIONAL PARKS.


[Captioner] 19:11:50
AT THIS TIME, I WILL ALSO THEN TURN IT BACK TO SEE IF THERE'S THE

[Captioner] 19:11:55
 RECIPIENT, I THINK, HAS ARRIVED FOR THIS EVENING'S

[Captioner] 19:11:58
 CEREMONIAL.
THAT WAS WHAT I WAS GOING TO SAY.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:12:09
AND I'LL BE COMING DOWN BUT I JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT THIS EVENING WE'RE SHARING A PROCLAMATION FOR

[Captioner] 19:12:13
 CHILDHOOD CANCER AWARENESS MONTH, WHICH IS THE MONTH OF SEPTEMBER 2023.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:12:18
I'LL BE RIGHT DOWN.


[Captioner] 19:12:48
AND THIS IS FOR CHILDHOOD CANCER AWARENESS MONTH, IN SEPTEMBER 2020 THREA.


[Captioner] 19:12:56
 WHEREAS, ACCORDING TO THE AMERICAN CHILDHOOD CANCER ORGANIZATION, CHILDHOOD CANCER

[Captioner] 19:13:00

IS THE LEADING CAUSE OF DISEASE FOR CHILDREN IN THE UNITED STATES.


[Captioner] 19:13:05
 WHEREAS, ACCORDING TO THE AMERICAN CHILDHOOD CANCER ORGANIZATION, APPROXIMATELY ONE OF EVERY SIX 

[Captioner] 19:13:11
CHILDREN IS NOT EXPECTED TO LIVE PAST FIVE YEARS OF AGE; AND WHEREAS, THE AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY ESTIMATES THAT

[Captioner] 19:13:17
 APPROXIMATELY 9,910 CHILDREN IN THE UNITED STATES UNDER 15 YEARS OF AGE WILL BE DIAGNOSED WITH

[Captioner] 19:13:24
 CANCER IN 2023; AND WHEREAS, THE POTENTIAL YEARS OF LIFE LOST TO CHILDHOOD CANCER AND THE POTENTIAL 

[Captioner] 19:13:32
YEARS OF LIFE SAVED BY TREATMENT EXCEED ALL OTHER CANCERS WITH THE

[Captioner] 19:13:39
 EXCEPTION OF BREAST CANCER; AND WHEREAS, MOST CHILDREN CANNOT BE TREATED AT A LOCAL HOSPITAL AND

[Captioner] 19:13:46
 FAMILIES MUST FACE THE DISRUPTION OF RELOCATING TO RECEIVE TREATMENT AT A REGIONAL CANCER CENTER; AND

[Captioner] 19:13:52
 WHEREAS, AS A RESULT OF MAJOR TREATMENT ADVANCES IN RECENT

[Captioner] 19:14:01
 DECADES, MORE THAN 85 PERCENT OF CHILDREN WITH CANCER NOW SURVIVE FIVE YEARS OR MORE; AND WHEREAS, THE 

[Captioner] 19:14:06
SURVIVAL RATE OF CHILDREN WITH CANCER HAS SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED SINCE

[Captioner] 19:14:13
 THE MID-1970'S, WHEN THE FIVE-YEAR SURVIVAL RATE WAS APPROXIMATELY 58 PERCENT; AND WHEREAS, SURVIVAL RATES 

[Captioner] 19:14:20
VARY DEPENDING ON THE TYPE OF CANCER AND OTHER FACTORS; AND WHEREAS, DUE TO CHILDREN’S

[Captioner] 19:14:26
 BODIES STILL GROWING AND CANCER TREATMENTS LARGELY GEARED

[Captioner] 19:14:32
 TOWARD USE ON ADULTS, CHILDREN ARE MORE LIKELY TO EXPERIENCE LONG-TERM SIDE EFFECTS FROM TREATMENT.

[Captioner] 19:14:38
 NOW, THEREFORE, THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF FREMONT, HEREBY

[Captioner] 19:14:45
 PROCLAIMS SEPTEMBER 2023 AS CHILDHOOD CANCER AWARENESS MONTH AND ENCOURAGES INDIVIDUALS,

[Captioner] 19:14:51
 BUSINESSES AND ORGANIZATIONS THROUGHOUT THE CITY TO PARTICIPATE IN ACTIVITIES AND EVENTS THAT PROMOTE 

[Captioner] 19:14:57
AWARENESS OF CHILDHOOD CANCER AND SUPPORT FAMILIES AFFECTED BY THIS DEVASTATING DISEASE NOT

[Captioner] 19:15:03
 JUST DURING SEPTEMBER BUT

[Captioner] 19:15:08
 THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. THE CITY OF FREMONT CELEBRATES THE PROGRESS OF ALL RELATED ORGANIZATIONS IN AIDING 

[Captioner] 19:15:14
CHILDREN BATTLING CHILDHOOD CANCER WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY RENEWING ITS COMMITMENT TO THAT CAUSE.

[Captioner] 19:15:19

SO I HAVE HERE TONIGHT MISS MEHTA, IF YOU WOULD COME AND SHARE SOME

[Captioner] 19:15:24
 WORDS, AND ALSO I WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW, I THINK GOLD IS THE COLOR THAT REPRESENTS THE

[Captioner] 19:15:27
 CHILDREN -- CHILDHOOD CANCER, SO THAT'S WHY I'M WEARING IT THIS EVENING.


[Captioner] 19:15:33
BUT THANK YOU SO MUCH.
PLEASE COME AND SHARE.


[Captioner] 19:15:57
>> HI, EVERYONE.
I'M

[Captioner] 19:16:02
 HIS MOM, HE PASSED AWAY FIVE YEARS BACK IN 2018 WHEN HE WAS 14 YEARS OLD.


[Captioner] 19:16:08
HE -- HE WAS IN SEVENTH GRADE WHEN HE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH DIPG.
IT'S A

[Captioner] 19:16:14
 PEDIATRIC BRAIN TUMOR, AND IT'S

[Captioner] 19:16:20
 TERMINAL, IT'S VERY AGGRESSIVE, THERE IS NO CURE, THERE IS ZERO PERCENT SURVIVAL, THERE

[Captioner] 19:16:25
 IS NO --

[Captioner] 19:16:31
 NEIL ARMSTRONG'S DAUGHTER HAD THIS IN THE 1960s WHEN SHE WAS 2 YEARS OLD AND FROM THERE UNTIL NOW,

[Captioner] 19:16:35
 THERE HAS BEEN NO RESEARCH DONE, NO PROGRESS DONE IN THIS DISEASE, AND FOR

[Captioner] 19:16:41
 ANY OTHER OF THESE KIND OF BRAINSTEM TUMORS, AND THE REASON

[Captioner] 19:16:47
 BEING BECAUSE THERE IS NO AWARENESS, BECAUSE WHEN THIS HAPPENED TO OUR CHILD, WE WERE NOT AWARE OF THIS AT

[Captioner] 19:16:53
 ALL, AND WE HAD TO EVEN GO OUT OF THE COUNTRY TO GET TREATMENTS IN MEXICO AND

[Captioner] 19:16:58
 ALL EXPERIMENTAL TREATMENTS, AND HE --

[Captioner] 19:17:03
 THE REASON AWARENESS IS VERY IMPORTANT IS BECAUSE ONLY WITH AWARENESS WOULD THERE

[Captioner] 19:17:08
 BE SOME RESEARCH AND THAT COULD PROBABLY LEAD TO SOME CURE.
AND LIKE MY SON DONATED HIS TUMOR TO

[Captioner] 19:17:14
 STANFORD HOSPITAL FOR RESEARCH, AND AFTER HE PASSED AWAY, WE HAVE NOW FORMED A

[Captioner] 19:17:20
 NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATION, AND WE ARE TRYING TO, YOU KNOW,

[Captioner] 19:17:25
 HELP AND FUND RESEARCH AND, YOU KNOW, DO SOME, YOU KNOW, LIKE EVEN

[Captioner] 19:17:30
 ADVOCACY, RIGHT, BECAUSE WE JUST HAD A BILL PASSED IN THE SENATE

[Captioner] 19:17:35
 FOR HAVING TEE CLAIREING SEPTEMBER AS CHILDHOOD CANCER MONTH BECAUSE CALIFORNIA

[Captioner] 19:17:41
 IS ONE OF THE 20 STATES IN THE U.S. WHICH HAS STILL NOT DECLARED

[Captioner] 19:17:47
 SEPTEMBER AS CHILDHOOD CANCER MONTH.
SO IT'S IN THE -- IT'S IN THE HOUSE

[Captioner] 19:17:52
 RIGHT NOW, AND THEN IT WILL 50 TO THE GOVERNOR, BUT THE

[Captioner] 19:17:58
 REASON THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT IS BECAUSE ONLY IF PEOPLE ARE AWARE THAT CHILDREN ARE DYING OF CANCER AND

[Captioner] 19:18:03
 KIDS ALSO GET CANCER, THEN ONLY THERE WILL BE SOME FEDERAL FUNDING.
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW, LIKE LITERALLY

[Captioner] 19:18:08
 ONLY LIKE LESS THAN 4% OF FEDERAL FUNDING GOES TO CHILDHOOD CANCER.
SO ALL

[Captioner] 19:18:12
 OF THE 20, 25,000 KIDS ARE JUST ALLOWED TO DIE AND THEN THERE'S NOTHING DONE FOR THEM.


[Captioner] 19:18:18
SO THERE'S ONLY LIKE FAMILIES WHOSE KIDS HAVE PASSED AWAY, THEY ARE, YOU KNOW, TRYING TO -- THEY

[Captioner] 19:18:23
 HAVE FOUNDATIONS, THEY TRY TO DO SOMETHING BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET OUR KIDS BACK

[Captioner] 19:18:29
 BUT WE DON'T WANT OTHER FAMILIES TO GO THROUGH WHAT HAS

[Captioner] 19:18:35
 HAPPENED, AND SO AWARENESS AND

[Captioner] 19:18:40
 DOING SOMETHING AND CARING FOR THIS CAUSE IS VERY IMPORTANT, AND THERE ARE SO MANY

[Captioner] 19:18:46
 THINGS ONE CAN DO LIKE, YOU KNOW, YOU CAN ALWAYS TALK TO PEOPLE LIKE RIGHT NOW, LIKE BREAST CANCER, EVERYBODY

[Captioner] 19:18:51
 IS AWARE, THE PINK RIBBON, EVERYBODY KNOWS, BUT SEPTEMBER, LIKE, NOBODY EVEN KNOWS THE GOLD

[Captioner] 19:18:57
 RIBBON MUCH.
BUT IF PEOPLE TALK ABOUT IT MORE DURING YOUR, YOU KNOW, FAMILIES,

[Captioner] 19:19:02
 WITH YOUR FRIENDS AND ALL, IF YOU JUST KIND OF PASS THAT MESSAGE ON, AND IF MORE PEOPLE ARE AWARE, THAT

[Captioner] 19:19:07
 COULD HELP, OR AT LEAST HELP SOME FOUNDATIONS WHO ARE TRYING TO DO SOME WORK, IF YOU CAN

[Captioner] 19:19:13
 DONATE, OR YOU KNOW, TRY TO TALK TO YOUR OFFICIALS, YOUR REPRESENTATIVES THAT MORE NEEDS TO BE

[Captioner] 19:19:18
 DONE BECAUSE ONCE YOU HAVE IT AND ONCE YOU GO THROUGH IT, DOING SOMETHING AT THAT POINT IS VERY LATE, AND

[Captioner] 19:19:23
 THE TIME IS LIKE, YOU KNOW, TO CARE NOW AND TO FEEL CONCERNED ABOUT IT

[Captioner] 19:19:28
 NOW, BECAUSE ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN TO ANYBODY AT ANY TIME, TO ANY OF YOUR LOVED

[Captioner] 19:19:33
 ONES, BECAUSE IF WE THINK THAT IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN TO US, LIKE WE NEVER THOUGHT WE WOULD BE A CANCER

[Captioner] 19:19:39
 FAMILY, LIKE -- BUT IT COULD HAPPEN TO ANYBODY.
SO

[Captioner] 19:19:44
 I JUST FEEL LIKE, YOU KNOW, IF YOU FEEL IT IN YOUR HEARTS, IF YOU NEED TO DO

[Captioner] 19:19:48
 SOMETHING FOR THE CHILD BECAUSE WHETHER A CHILD'S LIFE IS LOST, LIKE MORE THAN 70 YEARS OF LIVES ARE LOST.


[Captioner] 19:19:54
SO WE'RE NOT SAYING DON'T DO ANYTHING FOR ADULT CANCER, BUT LESS THAN 3% IS LIKE

[Captioner] 19:19:59
 VERY LITTLE, AND PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES DON'T REALLY DO MUCH BECAUSE THE NUMBERS ARE NOT

[Captioner] 19:20:05
 THERE, SO THE KIDS ARE THEN, YOU KNOW, I MEAN, SOMEBODY

[Captioner] 19:20:10
 NEEDS TO STAND UP AND BE THERE FOR THEM AND FIGHT FOR THEM.
SO

[Captioner] 19:20:15
 THANKS FOR CITY OF FREMONT FOR DECLARING SEPTEMBER AS PROCLAIMING IT FOR

[Captioner] 19:20:20
 THIS YEAR FOR SEPTEMBER AS CHILDHOOD CANCER MONTH.
SO THANKS AND WE HOPE

[Captioner] 19:20:26
 TO TAKE THIS FURTHER, WE'RE GOING TO D.C.  NEXT WEEK FOR THE

[Captioner] 19:20:32
 CUREFEST AND OUR FOUNDATION HAS BEEN INVITED TO THE WHITE HOUSE ALSO FOR THE MOONSHOT PROGRAM, SO WE'RE GOING

[Captioner] 19:20:37
 TO GO AND TALK ABOUT THIS MORE THERE TOO.
AND TRY AND PUSH THE NEEDLE FURTHER

[Captioner] 19:20:40
 AS MUCH AS WE CAN FOR ALL OUR CHILDREN'S SAKE.
SO THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:20:46
THANK YOU, EVERYONE, FOR LISTENING.


[Captioner] 19:21:20
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU SO MUCH.
I JUST WANTED TO,

[Captioner] 19:21:25
 AGAIN, THANK MAYOR MEI AND

[Captioner] 19:21:30
 -- TO CREATE SOMETHING THAT IS BENEFICIAL TO OTHERS AND

[Captioner] 19:21:33
 IS AN EFFORT TO SHOW THE LOVE AND LEGACY THAT WE CAN CREATE OUT OF THIS.


[Captioner] 19:21:38
SO I KNOW ON BEHALF OF OUR ENTIRE COUNCIL, OUR HEART GOES OUT TO YOU AND YOUR

[Captioner] 19:21:43
 FAMILY, BUT WE WISH YOU ALL GOD'S SPEED IN WHATEVER WE CAN DO TO HELP IN TERMS OF GETTING

[Captioner] 19:21:48
 AWARENESS OF THIS ISSUE.
SO BLESSINGS.


[Captioner] 19:21:55
NEXT IS -- WE'LL GO ON TO OUR REGULARLY SCHEDULED ITEMS.
WHICH BEGINS

[Captioner] 19:21:59
 WITH THE APPOINTMENTS FOR BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS.
WAIT, ONE MORE.


[Captioner] 19:22:03
2H, SORRY.
2H, THAT'S RIGHT, WE HAVE TO BRING THAT BACK.


[Captioner] 19:22:08
LET ME BRING THAT ITEM, WHICH  IS --

[Captioner] 19:22:18
 THE ACCEPTANCE OF FUNDING FOR -- STATE FUNDING GRANTS FOR SIX COMMERCIAL DISTRICTS,

[Captioner] 19:22:22
 WIFI ACCESS EXPANSION PROJECT.
AND I BELIEVE WE HAVE A SPEAKER ON THAT?


[Captioner] 19:22:27
>> Ms. Gauthier: KELLY ABREU.


[Captioner] 19:22:34
>> SO I LOOKED AT THE -- READ THROUGH THE DOCUMENTS A LITTLE BIT, AND I

[Captioner] 19:22:39
 COULDN'T FIGURE IT ALL OUT, BUT IT WAS VERY CLEAR TO ME THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT 100

[Captioner] 19:22:45
 MEGABITS PER SECOND DOWNLOAD SPEED MINIMUM REQUIREMENT, SO THAT SOUNDS

[Captioner] 19:22:52
  LIKE -- I'M NOT EVEN SURE IF THAT'S WIFI OR IF THAT'S A --

[Captioner] 19:22:57
 IF THAT'S REALLY A BROADBAND KIND OF A THING, WIRED CONNECTION.


[Captioner] 19:23:04
BUT IF IT IS BROADBAND AND WIRED

[Captioner] 19:23:10
 CONNECTIONS, I'M WONDERING IF THERE'S BEEN ANY THOUGHT TO ANY REAL COMMITMENT

[Captioner] 19:23:16
, ANY LEGALLY BINDING COMMITMENT TO PROVIDE WIFI IN

[Captioner] 19:23:20
 THESE HOT SPOT AREAS, IN THESE SIX AREAS.
YOU KNOW, AND IF SOME OF THE -- MAYBE 

[Captioner] 19:23:25
THEY HAVE SOME OTHER PROGRAM.
AND ALL THOSE PEOPLE THAT ARE LIVING IN THE RVs AND LIVING IN THE TENTS,

[Captioner] 19:23:30
 MAYBE THEY ALL GET LITTLE PHONES FROM THE -- FROM

[Captioner] 19:23:36
 SOMEBODY, FROM SOME GOVERNMENT AGENCY MAYBE, AND MAYBE THOSE PHONES CONNECT TO

[Captioner] 19:23:41
 CELL PHONE TOWERS.
MAYBE THEY DO HAVE, YOU KNOW -- THEY DO

[Captioner] 19:23:46
 HAVE INTERNET ACCESS, BUT IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE WIFI ACCESS FOR PEOPLE

[Captioner] 19:23:51
 WALKING BY, SO THAT, YOU KNOW, IF

[Captioner] 19:23:56
 ANYBODY -- THESE AREAS ARE PROBABLY DENSELY POPULATED.
SOME OF THEM

[Captioner] 19:24:01
 ARE.
CENTERVILLE IS, IRVINGTON IS, NILES IS, AND IF YOU HAD PEOPLE WALKING

[Captioner] 19:24:07
 BY WHO -- MAYBE THEY DIDN'T PAY THEIR WIFI BILL THAT MONTH,

[Captioner] 19:24:12
 THEIR INTERNET BILL, MAYBE THEY'RE OUT ON THE STREET, YOU KNOW, WITH NO

[Captioner] 19:24:17
 CONNECTION, MAYBE THEY COULD JUST WALK OVER AND, YOU KNOW, HOOK UP TO THE

[Captioner] 19:24:23
 WIFI.
I'M JUST WONDERING IF WE HAVE A REAL COMMITMENT TO DO WIFI.


[Captioner] 19:24:28
AND EVEN SIX SPOTS, SIX CITY CENTERS WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE.


[Captioner] 19:24:34
NOT JUST FEED BROADBAND WIRED FIBER

[Captioner] 19:24:40
 WHATEVER TO THE BUSINESSES, WHICH IS GREAT, THEY NEED

[Captioner] 19:24:45
 WIFI TOO, BUT THE COST OF PROVIDING WIFI, PUTTING A BOX ON A

[Captioner] 19:24:51
 CITY-OWNED TOWER AND PROVIDING 100 FEET OR 500 FEET OR WHATEVER IT IS OF

[Captioner] 19:24:56
 RADIUS, OF ACCESS, IS NOT THAT HIGH, AND COMPANIES

[Captioner] 19:25:01
 PUT UP THESE -- YOU KNOW, THEIR CELL PHONE TOWER POINTS EVERYWHERE AROUND

[Captioner] 19:25:06
 TOWN, BUT THE CITY COULD -- BUT THOSE ALL -- YOU HAVE TO PAY TO PLAY THERE.


[Captioner] 19:25:12
CITY COULD DO MORE.
THANKS.


[Captioner] 19:25:17
>> Mayor Mei: IS THERE ANY OTHER SPEAKER ON THAT ITEM?
OKAY.


[Captioner] 19:25:22
SEEING NONE, I WAS WONDERING, I DON'T KNOW -- IS OUR CTO

[Captioner] 19:25:26
 AVAILABLE?
I'M FAMILIAR WITH THE ANSWER, BUT I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE SANDY, IF HE COULD 

[Captioner] 19:25:32
RESPOND A LITTLE BIT ON THAT.
IS HE ON ZOOM?
>> City Mgr. Shackelford: SANDY,

[Captioner] 19:25:36
 CAN YOU WEIGH IN ON THAT JUST A BIT?
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
>> GOOD EVENING, MAYOR MEI AND CITY 

[Captioner] 19:25:41
COUNCILMEMBERS.
AS YOU KNOW, I'M SANDY TAYLOR, DIRECTOR OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY.


[Captioner] 19:25:47
SO REGARDING THIS ITEM, ACTUALLY WE HAVE TWO, THERE'S ITEM

[Captioner] 19:25:52
 2I AND 2H.


[Captioner] 19:25:58
 --
>> Mayor Mei: I'M SORRY, COULD YOU PLEASE SPEAK CLOSER TO THE MIC A 

[Captioner] 19:26:00
LITTLE BIT?
I'M HAVING SOME STRUGGLES HEARING YOU.


[Captioner] 19:26:05
THANK YOU.
>> OKAY.


[Captioner] 19:26:23
>> City Mgr. Shackelford: GIVE HIM JUST A MOMENT.


[Captioner] 19:26:27
>> HELLO, EVERYBODY.
I AM EXPERIENCING TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES IN MY OFFICE.


[Captioner] 19:26:36
SO -- HERE WE GO.


[Captioner] 19:26:42
BUT YOU KNOW, I'D LIKE TO JUST REALLY SPEAK ON TWO ITEMS.
ITEMS 2H

[Captioner] 19:26:47
 AND 2I.
THEY BOTH ARE APPROXIMATELY

[Captioner] 19:26:52
 $3 MILLION THAT WE'RE RECEIVING NOT ONLY FROM THE STATE, BUT FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.


[Captioner] 19:26:58
AND WE'LL BE USING OUR EXISTING FIBER BACKBONE THROUGHOUT THE CITY TO CONNECT UP

[Captioner] 19:27:03
 THESE SIX BUSINESS DISTRICT WITH WIFI.
THERE ISN'T

[Captioner] 19:27:08
 MENTION OF MINIMUM OF

[Captioner] 19:27:13
 100MG UPLOAD AND DOWNLOAD SPEEDS IN OUR STAFF REPORT, BUT HOWEVER, WE EXPECT TO ACHIEVE

[Captioner] 19:27:19
 THAT, YOU KNOW, THROUGH THIS DEPLOYMENT.
SO WE'RE REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THIS

[Captioner] 19:27:24
 OPPORTUNITY.
IT WILL BE PROLIFERATED THROUGHOUT THE CITY, NOT ONLY IN THOSE AREAS, BUT WE 

[Captioner] 19:27:30
PLAN TO EXTEND IT, YOU KNOW, FURTHER AS WELL.
BUT TODAY, WE'LL JUST

[Captioner] 19:27:35
 BEGIN BY TOUCHING THESE SIX AREAS IN THE CITY.
>> Mayor Mei: SO JUST

[Captioner] 19:27:40
 A POINT OF CLARIFICATION.
I KNOW THE SPEAKER ASKED THIS QUESTION, AND MY BELIEF IS THAT WE ARE 

[Captioner] 19:27:45
NOT JUST DOING THE HARD WIRING BUT WE'RE ALSO EXPANDING THE WIFI, AND THE QUESTION IS,

[Captioner] 19:27:50
 ARE WE PROVIDING FREE ACCESS WITHIN THOSE AREAS WITHIN A CERTAIN PROXIMITY OR

[Captioner] 19:27:56
 CIRCUMFERENCE OF THIS DEPLOYMENT?
>> YES, WE ARE.
THE PLAN

[Captioner] 19:28:01
 IS, IS THAT WE WILL USE OUR EXISTING, YOU KNOW, I.T. BUDGET TO PAY

[Captioner] 19:28:07
 FOR THE INTERNET ACCESS FEES,

[Captioner] 19:28:11
 BUT WE'VE RECEIVED GREATLY REDUCED COST FROM A LOCAL ISP WITHIN THE CITY OF FREMONT.


[Captioner] 19:28:18
>> Mayor Mei: SO AGAIN TO CLARIFY FOR THE CONSUMER OR THE PERSONS WALKING THROUGH THOSE SIX

[Captioner] 19:28:23
 DISTRICTS, WILL THEY BE GIVEN FREE ACCESS AND IS IT SOMETHING THEY NEED TO PAY

[Captioner] 19:28:28
 FOR?
>> MAYOR MEI, THE ACCESS WILL BE

[Captioner] 19:28:35
 FREE.
THE SSID OR THE NAME THAT WE PLAN TO GIVE

[Captioner] 19:28:40
 THIS FREE ACCESS WILL BE CALLED ACCESS FREMONT.
SO FROM ANY

[Captioner] 19:28:46
 SMART DEVICE, WHETHER IT'S A CELL PHONE OR A TABLET, THEY WOULD JUST SIMPLY LOOK

[Captioner] 19:28:51
 FOR THAT I.D., THAT WIFI, HOT SPOT I.D., CONNECT AND

[Captioner] 19:28:56
 THEY'LL BE ABLE TO GAIN FREE ACCESS.
AND THAT'S NOT ONLY FOR JUST FOLKS THAT ARE WALKING THROUGH

[Captioner] 19:29:01
 BUT IT'S LOCAL BUSINESSES THAT THE SIGNAL WILL PROPAGATE

[Captioner] 19:29:06
 INTO THEIR STOREFRONTS.


[Captioner] 19:29:09
>> Mayor Mei: GREAT.
I KNOW THAT'S PART OF WHY WHEN WE LOOKED AT THE GRANT OPPORTUNITIES THAT 

[Captioner] 19:29:15
WE LOOKED AT SOME OF THE LOCATIONS FOR THAT STRATEGIC ASPECT, BECAUSE TOO OFTEN

[Captioner] 19:29:20
 WE'VE SEEN SITUATIONS WHERE STUDENTS HAVE HAD TO GO

[Captioner] 19:29:26
  TO -- I'VE SEEN THE ADS AND OTHER THINGS WHERE THEY'VE HAD TO GO TO MCDONALD'S OR DIFFERENT DMEUNT

[Captioner] 19:29:32
 COMMUNITY CENTERS AND WE'VE HAD THAT OPPORTUNITY WITH COMCAST, THEY'VE SUPPORTED SOME OF THOSE IN OUR 

[Captioner] 19:29:36
COMMUNITY CENTERS FOR AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS AND OTHER THINGS FOR PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO DO THEIR HOMEWORK, BUT 

[Captioner] 19:29:41
BEING SUCH A DIVERSE COMMUNITY SOCIOECONOMICALLY AND ETHNICALLY, TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THAT, I THINK

[Captioner] 19:29:47
 IT ALSO HELPS SUPPORT SO MANY OF OUR SMALL BUSINESSES SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR RESPONSE.


[Captioner] 19:29:51
COUNCILMEMBER COX, DID YOU HAVE FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS?
>> Vice Mayor Cox: I WOULD JUST LIKE 

[Captioner] 19:29:53

>> Mayor Mei: OKAY.

[Captioner] 19:29:58

[Captioner] 19:30:02

ESPECIALLY FOR SUPPORTING SOME OF OUR SMALL BUSINESSES.
SO THANK YOU FOR THAT.

>> THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:30:50
