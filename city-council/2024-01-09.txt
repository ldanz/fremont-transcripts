LEADERSHIP THAT ALL OF YOU

[Captioner] 19:33:01
AND THE TEAM THAT WE HAVE AT THE 

[Captioner] 19:33:01

[Captioner] 19:33:10

I CAN'T BELIEVE, YOU KNOW, BLINK 

[Captioner] 19:33:12

[Captioner] 19:33:17
ACADEMY MATES WHO ARE STILL WITH 

[Captioner] 19:33:23
THE DEPARTMENT, LIEUTENANT RAMAN

[Captioner] 19:33:26

[Captioner] 19:33:28
YEARS BACK, AND LIEUTENANT BOKAJ 

[Captioner] 19:33:30

[Captioner] 19:33:33
MATES AND CONTINUE TO BE GREAT 

[Captioner] 19:33:33
PARTNERS IN THE DEPARTMENT.

LAST BUT NOT LEAST, I DO WANT TO

SUPPORTIVE WIFE AND FAMILY.

MY WIFE OF 23 YEARS, KATIE, MY 

[Captioner] 19:33:55

[Captioner] 19:33:57
COULDN'T THANK YOU ENOUGH FOR

ALL YOUR SUPPORT, YOUR LOVE, AND 

[Captioner] 19:33:58
I LOVE YOU.

[Captioner] 19:33:59
SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

[Captioner] 19:34:00
[APPLAUSE]

[Captioner] 19:34:29
>> Councilmember Salwan: I JUST 

[Captioner] 19:34:31
WANT TO SAY, HUSKIES ARE WELL 

[Captioner] 19:34:32
REPRESENTED HERE TONIGHT BECAUSE 

[Captioner] 19:34:33
I'M ALSO A HUSKY.

[Captioner] 19:34:36
WE HAVE OUR FORMER LIBRARIAN 

[Captioner] 19:34:38
FROM WASHINGTON HIGH SCHOOL HERE 

[Captioner] 19:34:41
TOO, FORMER COUNCILMEMBER JUDY 

[Captioner] 19:34:41
ZLATNIK.

[Captioner] 19:34:42
SO WELL REPRESENTED.

[Captioner] 19:34:44
CONGRATULATIONS, EVERYBODY.

[Captioner] 19:35:11
SO WITH THAT, I GUESS WE'LL GO 

[Captioner] 19:35:13
TO THE ITEMS THAT WERE REMOVED 

[Captioner] 19:35:13
FROM CONSENT.

[Captioner] 19:35:15
>> Ms. Gauthier: ORAL 

[Captioner] 19:35:15
COMMUNICATIONS FIRST.

[Captioner] 19:35:20
WE HAVE TWO SPEAKER CARDS.

[Captioner] 19:35:20
>>

[Captioner] 19:35:21
>> Councilmember Salwan: WE'LL 

[Captioner] 19:35:22
GO ON TO ORAL COMMUNICATIONS.

[Captioner] 19:35:23
>> Ms. Gauthier: WE HAVE TWO 

[Captioner] 19:35:23
SPEAKER CARDS.

[Captioner] 19:35:28
THE FIRST IS THOMAS CABRAL, 

[Captioner] 19:35:30
FOLLOWED BY KELLY ABREU.

[Captioner] 19:35:31
>> Councilmember Salwan: WE'LL 

[Captioner] 19:35:35
ALLOW 3 MINUTES PER SPEAKER.

[Captioner] 19:35:39
>> HELLO.

[Captioner] 19:35:40
>> Ms. Gauthier: PUSH THE 

[Captioner] 19:35:40
BUTTON, PLEASE.

[Captioner] 19:35:47
>> I LIVE AT 3632 ADAMS AVENUE.

[Captioner] 19:35:51
AND AROUND MY HOUSE, MY 

[Captioner] 19:35:52
BACKYARD, THERE'S A NEW PROJECT, 

[Captioner] 19:35:53
THE ROBERTS TOWNHOMES.

[Captioner] 19:35:57
I HAVE EMAILED ALL OF YOU.

[Captioner] 19:36:00
I HAVE SENT LETTERS TO ALL OF 

[Captioner] 19:36:02
YOU ABOUT NONE OF THE DESIGN 

[Captioner] 19:36:04
RULES BEING FOLLOWED AS TO 

[Captioner] 19:36:05
PRIVACY OF MY BACKYARD.

[Captioner] 19:36:10
I HAVE 15 LARGE WINDOWS, EIGHT

[Captioner] 19:36:14
 BALCONIES STARING RIGHT INTO MY 

[Captioner] 19:36:15
BACKYARD, WHERE OUR POOL S WHERE 

[Captioner] 19:36:20
WE BARBECUE, AND NOBODY WILL DO 

[Captioner] 19:36:20
NOTHING.

[Captioner] 19:36:22
THE PLANNING COMMISSION HAS 

[Captioner] 19:36:24
GIVEN ALL THESE -- THEY WILL NOT 

[Captioner] 19:36:26
GIVE ME A REASON WHY THE DESIGN 

[Captioner] 19:36:29
RULES WERE NOT FOLLOWED.

[Captioner] 19:36:34
I'VE WRITTEN NUMEROUS LETTERS

[Captioner] 19:36:37
 SINCE 2020 ASKING WHY THERE'S 

[Captioner] 19:36:40
NO SCREENING AROUND MY 

[Captioner] 19:36:40
PROPERTY.

[Captioner] 19:36:44
AND IT'S FALLEN ON DEAF EARS AND 

[Captioner] 19:36:45
BLIND EYES.

[Captioner] 19:36:50
NOBODY -- I SENT CERTIFIED 

[Captioner] 19:36:53
LETTERS TO SHACKELFORD, 

[Captioner] 19:36:56
ALVARADO, TERESA COX AND LILY 

[Captioner] 19:36:58
MEI OF ALL THE DESIGN RULES THAT 

[Captioner] 19:37:02
WERE NOT MET.

[Captioner] 19:37:06
THE PLANNING REPORT WAS 

[Captioner] 19:37:06
COMPLETELY FALSE.

[Captioner] 19:37:10
IT DID NOT EVEN LIST -- I BORDER 

[Captioner] 19:37:12
MORE OF THE PROJECT THAN ANY 

[Captioner] 19:37:15
OTHER PRIVATE RESIDENCE, AND MY 

[Captioner] 19:37:18
PROPERTY WAS NOT EVEN LISTED, SO 

[Captioner] 19:37:21
IT WASN'T ADDRESSED AS TO THE 

[Captioner] 19:37:22
PRIVACY.

[Captioner] 19:37:25
THEY SAID THEY WERE GOING TO PUT 

[Captioner] 19:37:25
TREES.

[Captioner] 19:37:28
THE PLANNING -- JOEL AND MARK 

[Captioner] 19:37:29
SAID OH, THEY'RE GOING TO PUT 

[Captioner] 19:37:29
TREES.

[Captioner] 19:37:32
OKAY, THEY PUT A TREE THAT GOES 

[Captioner] 19:37:35
ABOUT 6 INCHES ABOVE THE WALL.

[Captioner] 19:37:35
IT'S ABOUT THIS BIG.

[Captioner] 19:37:40
AND THE BALCONY IS RIGHT THERE, 

[Captioner] 19:37:40
12 FEET FROM MY PROPERTY.

[Captioner] 19:37:44
THERE'S EIGHT BALCONIES 12 FEET 

[Captioner] 19:37:45
FROM MY PROPERTY WHERE YOU COULD 

[Captioner] 19:37:47
JUST STAND ON THE BALCONY AND WE 

[Captioner] 19:37:49
COULD BARBECUE TOGETHER WITH THE 

[Captioner] 19:37:49
PEOPLE.

[Captioner] 19:37:53
AND THEY THINK IT'S FUNNY 

[Captioner] 19:37:54
BECAUSE IT'S NOT THEIR 

[Captioner] 19:37:54
BACKYARD.

[Captioner] 19:37:57
SO THEY WON'T DO ANYTHING.

[Captioner] 19:38:01
SO I CONSIDER THAT FRAUD, WHEN 

[Captioner] 19:38:05
THEY SUBMIT A PLANNING REPORT 

[Captioner] 19:38:06
THAT IS INCOMPLETE AND FALSE.

[Captioner] 19:38:11
IS THAT IT?

[Captioner] 19:38:12
>> Councilmember Salwan: YOU 

[Captioner] 19:38:14
HAVE A FEW SECONDS LEFT, SIR.

[Captioner] 19:38:15
>> OKAY.

[Captioner] 19:38:19
AND I HAVE THE MULTIFAMILY

[Captioner] 19:38:20
 DESIGN GUIDELINES.

[Captioner] 19:38:23
THEY TOLD ME THEY WERE 

[Captioner] 19:38:26
SUBJECTIVE, THAT THEY DECIDE HOW 

[Captioner] 19:38:28
MUCH DIRECT SIGHT LINE CAN COME 

[Captioner] 19:38:28
INTO MY PROPERTY.

[Captioner] 19:38:31
WELL, IT SAYS OBJECTIVE.

[Captioner] 19:38:33
SO IT'S BASED IN FACT.

[Captioner] 19:38:37
THAT THERE IS TO BE NO DESIGN -- 

[Captioner] 19:38:41
NO DIRECT SIGHT LINE INTO MY 

[Captioner] 19:38:41
PROPERTY.

[Captioner] 19:38:42
>> Councilmember Salwan: THANK 

[Captioner] 19:38:43
YOU, SIR.

[Captioner] 19:38:44
IF THERE'S ANY INFORMATION YOU 

[Captioner] 19:38:45
WANT TO LEAVE, YOU CAN LEAVE IT 

[Captioner] 19:38:45
WITH THE CITY CLERK.

[Captioner] 19:38:46
THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 19:38:47
>> ALL RIGHT.

[Captioner] 19:38:50
I'LL BE BACK FOR THE NEXT ONE.

[Captioner] 19:38:51
>> Councilmember Salwan: WE HAVE 

[Captioner] 19:38:52
HIS CONTACT.

[Captioner] 19:38:53
NEXT SPEAKER.

[Captioner] 19:38:54
>> Ms. Gauthier: KELLY ABREU.

[Captioner] 19:39:07
>> SO THIS IS A TENS OF MILLIONS 

[Captioner] 19:39:11
OF DOLLARS OF FREEWAY 

[Captioner] 19:39:14
INTERCHANGE THAT WILL BE 

[Captioner] 19:39:14
REBUILT.

[Captioner] 19:39:15
>> Councilmember Salwan: MR. 

[Captioner] 19:39:16
ABREU, THIS IS FOR ORAL 

[Captioner] 19:39:16
COMMUNICATION.

[Captioner] 19:39:18
WE'RE GOING TO COME BACK TO THE 

[Captioner] 19:39:18
OTHER ITEM.

[Captioner] 19:39:19
>> ALL RIGHT.

[Captioner] 19:39:20
LET'S TALK ABOUT ORAL 

[Captioner] 19:39:20
COMMUNICATIONS.

[Captioner] 19:39:30
CAPTAIN SNELSON HAS BEEN 

[Captioner] 19:39:31
INSTRUMENTAL IN KEY INITIATIVES 

[Captioner] 19:39:32
SUCH AS THE DATA-DRIVEN 

[Captioner] 19:39:34
POLICING, WHICH WAS SPOTLIGHTED 

[Captioner] 19:39:36
IN THE LATEST STATE OF THE CITY 

[Captioner] 19:39:36
SPEECH.

[Captioner] 19:39:37
YOU MAY HAVE SEEN THAT SPEECH.

[Captioner] 19:39:40
AND INTELLIGENCE-LED POLICING, 

[Captioner] 19:39:43
WHICH RELIES ON AGENTS AND FIELD 

[Captioner] 19:39:43
OPERATIVES.

[Captioner] 19:39:46
THESE INITIATIVES REQUIRE PUBLIC 

[Captioner] 19:39:49
POLICY GUIDANCE, SET BY ELECTED 

[Captioner] 19:39:49
LEADERS.

[Captioner] 19:39:52
THE CITY NEEDS ANALYSTS, 

[Captioner] 19:39:54
ACCOUNTANTS AND AUDITORS TO 

[Captioner] 19:39:56
ENSURE THE ACCURACY OF ITS 

[Captioner] 19:39:58
FINANCIAL REPORTS AND POLICE 

[Captioner] 19:39:58
PERFORMANCE STATISTICS.

[Captioner] 19:40:02
THE CITY COUNCIL INSTALLED RED 

[Captioner] 19:40:05
LIGHT CAMERAS NEAR COSTCO WITH 

[Captioner] 19:40:08
$490 FINES THAT DOUBLED THE 

[Captioner] 19:40:10
NUMBER OF TOTAL NUMBER OF 

[Captioner] 19:40:12
TRAFFIC TICKETS ISSUED IN THE 

[Captioner] 19:40:14
CITY EVERY YEAR DOUBLED, ALMOST 

[Captioner] 19:40:15
DOUBLED WHEN YOU COUNT THOSE RED 

[Captioner] 19:40:16
LIGHT CAMERAS.

[Captioner] 19:40:19
AND -- BUT NONE OF THOSE RED 

[Captioner] 19:40:20
LIGHT CAMERA TICKETS WERE 

[Captioner] 19:40:22
SHOWING UP ON THE ANNUAL 

[Captioner] 19:40:23
COMPREHENSIVE FINANCIAL REPORT.

[Captioner] 19:40:24
NONE OF THEM.

[Captioner] 19:40:26
UNTIL RECENTLY.

[Captioner] 19:40:27
WHEN SOMEBODY COMPLAINED.

[Captioner] 19:40:29
IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO HIRE A NEW 

[Captioner] 19:40:31
MANAGEMENT ANALYST FOR 

[Captioner] 19:40:34
DATA-DRIVEN POLICING, AS WAS 

[Captioner] 19:40:36
SPOTLIGHTED IN THE CITY -- IN 

[Captioner] 19:40:39
THE STATE OF THE CITY SPEECH, 

[Captioner] 19:40:40
WHEN THE ANNUAL COMPREHENSIVE 

[Captioner] 19:40:41
FINANCIAL RECORD UNDERREPORTS 

[Captioner] 19:40:44
THE ARREST NUMBERS BY HALF.

[Captioner] 19:40:46
THE CITY COUNCIL SEEMS TO LEAVE 

[Captioner] 19:40:48
THE POLICE DEPARTMENT WITHOUT 

[Captioner] 19:40:50
MUCH POLICY DIRECTION.

[Captioner] 19:40:52
YOU, AS COUNCILMEMBERS, SHOULD 

[Captioner] 19:40:53
STEP UP TO THE CHALLENGE.

[Captioner] 19:40:56
YOU SHOULD TAKE TURNS ATTENDING 

[Captioner] 19:40:59
THE COMMUNITY ADVISORY BOARD MEETINGS.

[Captioner] 19:41:01
YOU SHOULD LISTEN TO THOSE 

[Captioner] 19:41:04
ADVISORY BOARD PROCEEDINGS TO 

[Captioner] 19:41:05
KEEP THE COUNCIL'S FINGERS ON 

[Captioner] 19:41:07
THE PULSE OF COMMUNITY POLICING.

[Captioner] 19:41:11
SO AS CAPTAIN SNELSON TODAY 

[Captioner] 19:41:13
EMBARKS ON HIS NEXT 20 YEARS OF 

[Captioner] 19:41:17
DISTINGUISHED SERVICE, THE 

[Captioner] 19:41:18
MEMBERS OF THIS CITY COUNCIL 

[Captioner] 19:41:22
SHOULD BE STANDING RIGHT BEHIND 

[Captioner] 19:41:23
HIM EVERY STEP OF THE WAY.

[Captioner] 19:41:23
THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 19:41:26
>> Councilmember Salwan: THANK 

[Captioner] 19:41:26
YOU.

[Captioner] 19:41:30
SO WITH THAT, WE CONCLUDE --

[Captioner] 19:41:31
>> Ms. Gauthier: THAT'S THE LAST 

[Captioner] 19:41:32
OF THE ORAL COMMUNICATION.

[Captioner] 19:41:32
>> Councilmember Salwan: OKAY.

[Captioner] 19:41:35
SO WE'LL GO BACK TO THE ITEMS 

[Captioner] 19:41:36
REMOVED FROM CONSENT.

[Captioner] 19:41:37
THAT WAS ITEM 2J.

[Captioner] 19:41:41
>> Ms. Gauthier: MR. ABREU 

[Captioner] 19:41:42
TURNED IN A CARD FOR 2J.

[Captioner] 19:41:44
>> Councilmember Salwan: OKAY.

[Captioner] 19:41:46
MR. ABREU, YOU HAD SOME 

[Captioner] 19:41:46
COMMENTS?

[Captioner] 19:41:49
>> SO, YEAH, THE -- THIS IS TENS 

[Captioner] 19:41:51
OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF A NEW 

[Captioner] 19:41:54
FREEWAY OFF-RAMP/INTERCHANGE 

[Captioner] 19:41:55
THAT WILL BE REBUILT.

[Captioner] 19:41:59
AND THIS FREEWAY -- THE 

[Captioner] 19:42:02
STANDARDS FOR FREEWAY -- THE 

[Captioner] 19:42:03
REBUILDING, BY THE WAY, THE 

[Captioner] 19:42:04
JUSTIFICATION FOR THIS IS 

[Captioner] 19:42:07
CLASSIC BUREAUCRATIC MUMBO 

[Captioner] 19:42:08
JUMBO.

[Captioner] 19:42:11
IT'S SOMETHING ABOUT MODERNIZE,

[Captioner] 19:42:13
 IMPROVE, UPGRADE, AND IT SAYS 

[Captioner] 19:42:14
NOTHING ABOUT WHY ARE YOU DOING 

[Captioner] 19:42:14
THIS.

[Captioner] 19:42:17
IT SAYS, OH, YEAH, WE'RE GOING 

[Captioner] 19:42:18
TO MODERNIZE, AS IF YOU 

[Captioner] 19:42:18
MODERNIZE EVERYTHING.

[Captioner] 19:42:23
NO, THERE'S MORE

[Captioner] 19:42:25
 TO IT THAN MODERNIZING.

[Captioner] 19:42:26
THIS IS NOT MODERNIZING.

[Captioner] 19:42:28
THIS IS A SAFETY HAZARD THAT YOU 

[Captioner] 19:42:29
DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT, DON'T 

[Captioner] 19:42:30
WANT TO ADMIT.

[Captioner] 19:42:32
THIS FREEWAY OFF-RAMP, IF YOU 

[Captioner] 19:42:34
LOOK AT THE DESIGN STANDARDS FOR 

[Captioner] 19:42:38
FREEWAY OFF-RAMPS SET BY THE 

[Captioner] 19:42:40
FEDERAL HIGHWAY -- WHATEVER, 

[Captioner] 19:42:41
COMMISSION, THEY TALK ABOUT THE 

[Captioner] 19:42:43
MAXIMUM SLOPE OF INTERSTATE 

[Captioner] 19:42:45
FREEWAY OFF-RAMP IS TYPICALLY 6 

[Captioner] 19:42:48
OR 7% UP TO 6% GENERALLY ALLOWED 

[Captioner] 19:42:51
IN MOUNTAINOUS AREAS, THIS IS A 

[Captioner] 19:42:52
MOUNTAINOUS AREA, AND AN 

[Captioner] 19:42:53
ADDITIONAL 1% IS ALLOWED IN 

[Captioner] 19:42:56
URBAN AREAS, THIS IS AN URBAN 

[Captioner] 19:42:57
AREA, AND THE DESIGN STANDARDS 

[Captioner] 19:42:59
ALSO STATE THAT A MAXIMUM GRADE 

[Captioner] 19:43:02
OF 8%, THIS ONE IS 8%, SHOULD 

[Captioner] 19:43:04
ONLY BE USED IF THE LENGTH OF 

[Captioner] 19:43:06
SUCH GRADE IS RELATIVELY SHORT.

[Captioner] 19:43:07
WHY IS THAT?

[Captioner] 19:43:09
BECAUSE AS YOU GO DOWN AN 

[Captioner] 19:43:10
INCLINED RAMP, YOU LEARNED THIS 

[Captioner] 19:43:12
IN WASHINGTON HIGH SCHOOL, YOU 

[Captioner] 19:43:13
BUILD UP ENERGY, YOU KNOW?

[Captioner] 19:43:15
AND IT GOES FALLING FASTER AND 

[Captioner] 19:43:16
FASTER.

[Captioner] 19:43:18
AND THEN BY THE TIME THE BIG 

[Captioner] 19:43:20
HEAVY DIRT TRUCKS GET TO THE 

[Captioner] 19:43:21
BOTTOM OF THE RAMP, THEY'RE HARD 

[Captioner] 19:43:21
TO BRAKE.

[Captioner] 19:43:26
THEY'RE GOING FAST, YOU GAVE

[Captioner] 19:43:27
 THEM EXTRA ENERGY ON YOUR 

[Captioner] 19:43:27
RAMP.

[Captioner] 19:43:28
WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING OUT 

[Captioner] 19:43:29
THERE?

[Captioner] 19:43:33
THIS IS NEAR A HIGH SCHOOL, IT'S 

[Captioner] 19:43:34
NOT -- IT'S CALLED MISSION SAN 

[Captioner] 19:43:36
JOSÉ HIGH SCHOOL, RIGHT THERE, A 

[Captioner] 19:43:37
BLOCK AWAY, NEXT TO MCDONALD'S.

[Captioner] 19:43:39
AND WHAT HAPPENS?

[Captioner] 19:43:41
FIVE TIMES, I'VE COUNTED THEM, 

[Captioner] 19:43:43
AT LEAST FIVE TIMES, MAYBE SIX, 

[Captioner] 19:43:45
I DON'T KNOW, YOU GUYS HAVE 

[Captioner] 19:43:46
BETTER COUNTS THAN I DO, AT 

[Captioner] 19:43:48
LEAST FIVE TIMES, THOSE TRUCKS 

[Captioner] 19:43:50
HAVE COME DOWN AND THEY'VE 

[Captioner] 19:43:50
OVERTURNED.

[Captioner] 19:43:54
THEY'VE SPILLED LOADS OF CEMENT 

[Captioner] 19:43:56
AND GRAVEL AND DIRT ALL OVER 

[Captioner] 19:43:58
YOUR INTERSTATE -- YOUR STATE 

[Captioner] 19:44:00
HIGHWAY CALLED MISSION 

[Captioner] 19:44:00
BOULEVARD.

[Captioner] 19:44:02
IT'S A STATE HIGHWAY RIGHT 

[Captioner] 19:44:02
THERE.

[Captioner] 19:44:04
AND IT'S EMBARRASSING, YOU 

[Captioner] 19:44:04
KNOW?

[Captioner] 19:44:06
THE POLICE DEPARTMENT, THEY'VE 

[Captioner] 19:44:07
GOT TO GO OUT THERE AND TAKE 

[Captioner] 19:44:10
CARE OF IT AND THE PUBLIC WORKS 

[Captioner] 19:44:11
AGENCY AND EVERYBODY ELSE.

[Captioner] 19:44:13
AND THAT'S WHY THIS IS SUCH A 

[Captioner] 19:44:13
MESS.

[Captioner] 19:44:16
BECAUSE THAT HAPPENED -- ONE 

[Captioner] 19:44:17
YEAR THERE WERE SEVERAL OF THESE 

[Captioner] 19:44:18
TRUCKS CRASHING.

[Captioner] 19:44:20
AND THAT'S WHY YOU NEED TO GET 

[Captioner] 19:44:22
OUT THERE AND FIX THIS THING, 

[Captioner] 19:44:24
BECAUSE THE WHOLE THING WAS 

[Captioner] 19:44:26
DESIGNED, IF YOU GOT AN 8% GRADE 

[Captioner] 19:44:28
AND IT'S LONG AS HELL, IT'S A 

[Captioner] 19:44:28
DANGER.
