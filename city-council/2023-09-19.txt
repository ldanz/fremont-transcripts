[Captioner] 19:20:55

[Captioner] 19:21:01
 YOU.
THE REPRESENTATION

[Captioner] 19:21:06
 OF OUR CULTURE IN THE FILM IN CINEMA IS

[Captioner] 19:21:11
 ACTUALLY VERY IMPORTANT, AND SOME OF YOU MAY KNOW SOMETHING THAT OUGHT TO BE TITLED

[Captioner] 19:21:17
 THE REAL HOUSEWIVES OF RUBY HILL.
RUBY HILL IS IN PLEASANTON AND

[Captioner] 19:21:22
 IT'S A REALITY TV KIND OF A SHOW WHICH DOES EXACTLY THE KIND

[Captioner] 19:21:28
 OF THINGS, STUNTS THAT YOU WOULD RESPECT ON A REALITY TV SHOW, BUT FREMONT HAS

[Captioner] 19:21:33
 A REAL MOVIE, A SERIOUS FILM CALLED FREMONT,

[Captioner] 19:21:38
 IS THE TITLE OF THE FILM.
AND IT SEEMS THAT -- THE

[Captioner] 19:21:43
 FILM IS A VERY ACCURATE ANALYSIS OR INSIGHTFUL

[Captioner] 19:21:50
 PENETRATING INSIGHT INTO THE POLITICAL AND SOCIAL CULTURE OF FREMONT

[Captioner] 19:21:55
.
AND A LOT OF THE MESSAGE THERE THAT THE DIRECTOR IS TRYING TO PUT

[Captioner] 19:22:01
 OUT IS VERY TIMELY AND VERY APT AND VERY CORRECTLY AIMED HIS

[Captioner] 19:22:06
 ANALYSIS OF OUR CULTURE, VERY ACCURATE, RIGHT HERE IN

[Captioner] 19:22:12
 CENTERVILLE, THE WHOLE CITY, AND IN THE CITY HUMAN SERVICES

[Captioner] 19:22:17
 DEPARTMENT.
BECAUSE A LOT OF

[Captioner] 19:22:23
 THE CITY POLICIES ARE BASED ON THIS IDEA OF

[Captioner] 19:22:28
 FEMALE DISEMPOWERMENT,  FEMALE, YOU KNOW

[Captioner] 19:22:35
, -- YEAH, DISEMPOWERMENT, AND THAT'S

[Captioner] 19:22:40
 ENTIRELY OVERBLOWN.
IN FACT, THE

[Captioner] 19:22:45
 FILM DIRECTOR, WHEN HE SPOKE TO THEM ABOUT THE

[Captioner] 19:22:50
 MOVIE FOR OVER AN HOUR, SOMETHING THAT HAS ANNOYED ME A LOT IS THE REPRESENTATION OF AFGHAN WOMEN IN THE 

[Captioner] 19:22:55
MEDIA AND THE CINEMA AND THAT THEY SEEM TO SOLELY FOCUS ON THE OPPRESSION THAT THEY WERE UNDER AND THAT IS NOT

[Captioner] 19:23:01
 UNTRUE, BECAUSE, OF COURSE, IT'S DIRE, THE SITUATION FOR THEM.
BUT HAVING GROWN UP AROUND AFGHAN 

[Captioner] 19:23:06
WOMEN IN IRAN AND ALSO ABROAD, MOST AFGHAN WOMEN I MET WERE VERY INDEPENDENT, THEY HAD A

[Captioner] 19:23:11
 SENSE OF AGENCY, THEY HAD DESIRES, THEY HAD WISHES, AND

[Captioner] 19:23:16
 WE SELDOM HEARD OR SAW ANYTHING ABOUT THAT.
SO WHEN HE WROTE THE

[Captioner] 19:23:21
 MOVIE ACTUALLY -- HE HAD A WOMAN WRITE THE MOVIE, BUT WHEN HE FILMED THE MOVIE

[Captioner] 19:23:27
 AND WHEN HE CAME UP WITH THE CONCEPT FOR THIS MOVIE, IT'S ALL

[Captioner] 19:23:33
 ABOUT TRYING TO PORTRAY AFGHAN WOMEN MORE ACCURATELY, AND

[Captioner] 19:23:38
 THE RESULT OF THIS KIND OF MISPERCEPTION IS PERHAPS AN

[Captioner] 19:23:44
 IMBALANCE IN THE TREATMENT OF THE AFGHAN COMMUNITY BY

[Captioner] 19:23:49
 YOUR HUMAN SERVICES DEPARTMENT.


[Captioner] 19:23:54
>> Ms. Gauthier: THE NEXT SPEAKER IS SALEEM MASTON.


[Captioner] 19:24:05
>> GOOD EVENING, MAYOR AND THE CITY COUNCILMEMBERS AND THE STAFF.
I'M SORRY I WAS LATE FOR

[Captioner] 19:24:11
 THE PRESENTATION BUT I'VE GOT TO SAY A FEW WORDS TOO FOR THE MUSLIM APPRECIATION

[Captioner] 19:24:14
 MONTH.
WHAT IS TO BE A MUSLIM IN FREMONT, CALIFORNIA?


[Captioner] 19:24:21
WE CAME HERE ABOUT 50, 45 YEARS AGO, AND WE

[Captioner] 19:24:26
 SETTLED HERE AND STARTED BECOMING A FAMILY WHICH IS NOW OVER 500 PEOPLE.


[Captioner] 19:24:33
IN THESE 45 YEARS OF FREMONT, WE HAVE MADE SURE

[Captioner] 19:24:38
 THAT WE AS A COMMUNITY NOT ONLY THINK

[Captioner] 19:24:43
 ABOUT JUST MUSLIMS BUT EVERYBODY -- WE HAVE ENCOMPASSED EVERYONE ALONG

[Captioner] 19:24:48
 WITH US.
I WILL NAME A FEW THINGS THAT WE DID.
ONE WAS DURING COVID,

[Captioner] 19:24:53
 WE FED OVER 150,000 HOT MEALS TO THE

[Captioner] 19:24:59
 HOMELESS PEOPLE.
THEN WE OPENED SCHOOLS HERE.
WE

[Captioner] 19:25:04
 HAVE TWO SCHOOLS, KINDERGARTEN THROUGH THE EIGHTH GRADE

[Captioner] 19:25:10
 IN OUR TWO MOSQUES AND THERE IS ANOTHER HIGH SCHOOL WHICH IS RENTED SPACE

[Captioner] 19:25:15
 IN OHLONE COLLEGE, SO THERE ARE THREE SCHOOLS WITH ABOUT -- BETWEEN THE SCHOOLS AND

[Captioner] 19:25:20
 THE EDUCATION, OVER A THOUSAND KIDS ARE BEING EDUCATED ALL ON PRIVATE

[Captioner] 19:25:26
 FUNDING, NO MONEY FROM ANY STATE GOVERNMENT OR CITY.


[Captioner] 19:25:32
THEN WE HAVE JOINED VARIOUS ORGANIZATIONS.
I'LL GIVE YOU ONE EXAMPLE LIKE THE

[Captioner] 19:25:37
 POLICE DEPARTMENT.
WE WORKED WITH THE POLICE DEPARTMENT AND

[Captioner] 19:25:42
 DURING THEIR GUN BUY BACK PROGRAM WHEN THEY WANTED TO RAISE $25,000, WE RAISED

[Captioner] 19:25:47
 ABOUT $18,500 FOR THE GUN BUYBACK PROGRAM, WHICH WE WANTED

[Captioner] 19:25:52
 TO MAKE SURE THAT NOBODY HAS GUNS THAT WOULD HARM OTHER PEOPLE.
THEN

[Captioner] 19:25:57
 OUR SCHOOLS HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH VARIOUS ORGANIZATIONS

[Captioner] 19:26:04
, COLLECTING BLANKETS DURING THE FIRE IN PARADISE,

[Captioner] 19:26:10
 SANTA ROSA, WE COLLECTED FOOD, WE DELIVERED TO THEM,

[Captioner] 19:26:15
 GIFT CARDS, AND WE EVEN WENT THERE, OPENED THE MOSQUE OVER THERE SO THAT

[Captioner] 19:26:20
 THEY COULD TAKE SHOWERS AND ALL OF THAT.
NOW WE ARE WORKING ON

[Captioner] 19:26:25
 A BATTERED WOMAN HOME ON MISSION BOULEVARD WHICH WOULD HOME BETWEEN 30

[Captioner] 19:26:31
 TO 50 WOMEN.
AND THAT, WE ARE WORKING ON RIGHT NOW, THERE IS A

[Captioner] 19:26:36
 GRANT OF THE CITY OF THE $30 MILLION WHICH WE WILL BE APPLYING TO BUY THIS

[Captioner] 19:26:42
 PROPERTY, IT'S A 25-ACRE PROPERTY ON MISSION BOULEVARD, IT IS A HOTEL BUILDING AND WE ARE

[Captioner] 19:26:48
 WORKING ON TO GET THIS.
ALONG WITH ALL OF THE CITY COUNCILMEMBERS, WE HAVE

[Captioner] 19:26:53
 WORKED WITH THE SCHOOL BOARD, WE HAVE WORKED

[Captioner] 19:26:58
 WITH THE HOSPITAL PEOPLE, THE NURSES, AND MOST OF ALL, YOU JUST HEARD THE

[Captioner] 19:27:03
 PEOPLE, THEY HAVE BEEN WORKING AND PROVIDING

[Captioner] 19:27:08
 FOOD AND OTHER ITEMS THAT ARE IMPORTANT.
SO THIS IS WHAT

[Captioner] 19:27:14
 THE MUSLIM COMMUNITY OF FREMONT HAS DONE, AND WE HAVE MADE IT -- WE ARE ONE OF THE GROUPS THAT HAS MADE

[Captioner] 19:27:20
 IT ALONG WITH ALL OF YOU THE HAPPIEST PLACE ON EARTH.
WE APPRECIATE YOUR EFFORTS,

[Captioner] 19:27:27
 WE APPRECIATE THE EFFORTS OF THE STAFF, WE APPRECIATE THE EFFORTS OF THE SCHOOL, THE POLICE DEPARTMENT,

[Captioner] 19:27:32
 THE FREMONT PLANNING DEPARTMENT, ALL THE COMMISSIONS, WE THANK YOU FOR ALL THE

[Captioner] 19:27:37
 SERVICES THAT YOU HAVE DONE.
SO IT IS MORE LIKE A FREMONT APPRECIATION

[Captioner] 19:27:42
 MONTH FOR ALL OF US.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:27:49
>> Ms. Gauthier: THAT'S THE LAST PUBLIC SPEAKER.
THERE'S NOTHING ON ZOOM EITHER.


[Captioner] 19:27:54
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY, GREAT.
THANK YOU SO MUCH

[Captioner] 19:27:59
 I APPRECIATE THAT CLARIFICATION.
THANK YOU FOR ALL WHO HAVE JOINED US.
WE ARE VERY FORTUNATE.


[Captioner] 19:28:04
I DIDN'T GET TO MENTION EARLIER THAT THIS IS ALSO HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH AND WE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY AND THERE'S

[Captioner] 19:28:09
 A FLAG NOW ALSO RAISED OVER THE CITY HALL, SO I WANTED TO MENTION THAT.
THANK YOU FOR ALL

[Captioner] 19:28:14
 WHO HAVE COME TO OUR COUNTRY AND WHO WORK WITH US TOGETHER AS A COMMUNITY TO BE ABLE TO

[Captioner] 19:28:20
 LIVE, WORK AND WORSHIP PEACEFULLY.
AT THIS TIME, THE AGENDA ITEM THAT WAS

[Captioner] 19:28:26
 PULLED WAS ITEM 2J AS IN JOHN, WHICH IS THE

[Captioner] 19:28:34
 ACTC PROJECT FUNDING AGREEMENTS.
AND I APOLOGIZE,

[Captioner] 19:28:39
 COULD YOU PLEASE CALL THE SPEAKER?
>> Ms. Gauthier: WE HAVE TWO SPEAKERS ON THAT

[Captioner] 19:28:44
 NOW IN PERSON.
KELLY ABREU FOLLOWED BY DANIEL

[Captioner] 19:28:51
 CARPELOVICH.


[Captioner] 19:28:59
>> THIS IS

[Captioner] 19:29:04
 ACTUALLY A MISHMASH OF TWO THINGS, A BICYCLE TRAIL ALONG

[Captioner] 19:29:09
 FREMONT BOULEVARD AND THERE'S A CLASS 1 TRAIL FROM THE EAST BAY GREENWAY TRAIL TO THE FREMONT

[Captioner] 19:29:14
 BART STATION.
NOW, THE AMAZING THING ABOUT THAT IS WE'VE BEEN HEARING A LOT ABOUT

[Captioner] 19:29:21
 THE EAST BAY GREENWAY TRAIL.
IT'S A VERY FLEXIBLE CONCEPT, BECAUSE NO ONE KNOWS WHERE THE EAST BAY 

[Captioner] 19:29:26
GREENWAY IS IN FREMONT.
WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT IT FOREVER, BUT NO ONE KNOWS WHERE IT IS, SO THAT

[Captioner] 19:29:32
 ENABLED YOUR STAFF TO JUST MOVE IT, YOU KNOW, IT USED TO BE

[Captioner] 19:29:38
 THE UNION PACIFIC RAILROAD CORRIDOR GOING FROM VALLEJO MILL TO CENTRAL

[Captioner] 19:29:43
 PARK, AND NOW IT'S SOME OTHER CORRIDOR KIND OF UNDEFINED.
IF

[Captioner] 19:29:48
 YOU LOOK AT THE REPORT, IT DOESN'T REALLY HAVE MAPS IN IT.
BUT -- SO WHEREVER THE EAST BAY 

[Captioner] 19:29:53
GREENWAY TRAIL IS, IT WAS REPUTED TO HAVE A SECRET

[Captioner] 19:29:59
 CONTAMINATION, YOU KNOW, LEGALLY HIDDEN, CONFIDENTIAL AND

[Captioner] 19:30:03
 UNDISCLOSED CONTAMINATION THAT MADE IT.
IT'S AN ABANDONED RAILROAD LINE.


[Captioner] 19:30:09
WELL, IN SAN JOSÉ, THEY JUST ANNOUNCED THE

[Captioner] 19:30:14
 TRAIL 2 MILES LONG, THE GREENWAY TRAIL, ALSO ABOUT TWO MILES LONG.


[Captioner] 19:30:19
THE SIMILARITIES ARE AMAZING.
THE FIVE WOUNDS TRAIL.
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME COMING.


[Captioner] 19:30:26
THE CITY WILL SPEND SEVERAL MILLION DOLLARS TO RID THE SOIL OF LEAD AND ARSENIC

[Captioner] 19:30:29
 CONTAMINATION.
THEY'RE VERY OPEN ABOUT THAT.
THEY'RE NOT HIDING IT.


[Captioner] 19:30:34
THEY JUST TELL YOU, IT'S LEAD AND ARSENIC AND THEY KNOW WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT, THEY'RE GOING TO GO CLEAN IT UP.


[Captioner] 19:30:39
THE SANTA CLARA VALLEY -- PARKS ARE GOING TO CONTRIBUTE HALF A MILLION DOLLARS EACH.


[Captioner] 19:30:45
THIS TRAIL IS GOING TO BE GOING THROUGH ALUM ROCK

[Captioner] 19:30:50
 AREA NEAR 101.
VERY HISPANIC AREA, BY THE WAY.


[Captioner] 19:30:56
AND IT WAS APPROVED BACK BY THEIR CITY COUNCIL

[Captioner] 19:31:00
 IN 2013.
AND TOOK THIS LONG TO GET TO THE NEXT STAGE.


[Captioner] 19:31:06
THEY'RE HOPING TO GET IT FINISHED BY 2031.
SO THE KEY HERE IS TO

[Captioner] 19:31:12
 REMEMBER THAT THE -- YOU KNOW, THE GATING FACTOR, THE MOST IMPORTANT THING

[Captioner] 19:31:17
 IS LAND.
LAND IS VERY SCARCE IN THESE CITIES, AND IF YOU HAVE AN ABANDONED RAILROAD, 

[Captioner] 19:31:22
WHAT YOU DO IS YOU TURN IT INTO A WALKING TRAIL AND BIKING TRAIL.
AND THERE'S ONE RIGHT THERE.


[Captioner] 19:31:27
IT'S CALLED UNION PACIFIC RAILROAD CORRIDOR

[Captioner] 19:31:33
 FROM VALLEJO MILL TO CENTRAL PARK, AND IT'S JUST SITTING THERE WAITING TO BE REDEVELOPED, AND

[Captioner] 19:31:38
 IT'S NOT -- THEY'VE RENAMED IT, IT NOW HAS SOME OTHER NAME, IT'S NOT

[Captioner] 19:31:43
 THE EAST BAY GREENWAY ANY MORE BUT IT'S STILL THERE AND IT'S GOING TO STAY THERE UNTIL YOU FIGURE OUT HOW TO 

[Captioner] 19:31:48
DEAL WITH THE LEAD AND THE ARSENIC AND WHATEVER ELSE IS THERE, ALL THE SECRET CONTAMINANTS YOU KNOW ABOUT, YOU 

[Captioner] 19:31:53
TESTED FOR THEM.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:32:02
>> Ms. Gauthier: DANIEL?


[Captioner] 19:32:11
>> THANK YOU, MAYOR MEI AND COUNCIL, FOR

[Captioner] 19:32:16
 THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ON THIS ISSUE.
I URGE UH-OH VOTE YES ON

[Captioner] 19:32:21
 ITEM 2J.
PROCEEDING WITH DESIGN ACTIVITIES ON THESE TWO CORRIDORS IS A COMMON SENSE

[Captioner] 19:32:27
 NEXT STEP IN MAKING ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION SAFER IN FREMONT.
IF

[Captioner] 19:32:32
 ANYTHING, MORE INVESTMENT IS NEEDED FASTER.
THIS IS NOT QUITE ENOUGH, I WOULD

[Captioner] 19:32:37
 SAY.
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE EAST BAY GREENWAY PROJECT EXTEND PAST

[Captioner] 19:32:43
 FREMONT BART, CONNECT TO THE ALAMEDA CREEK TRAIL AND AS THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER SAID,

[Captioner] 19:32:49
 USING THAT UNION PACIFIC CORRIDOR WOULD ALSO BE A

[Captioner] 19:32:54
 GOOD ADDITION.
THE FREMONT BOULEVARD BIKEWAY IS A

[Captioner] 19:33:00
 CRITICALLY IMPORTANT PROJECT THAT IS SORELY NEEDED.
IT IS NEXT TO, YOU KNOW, IT

[Captioner] 19:33:05
 JOINS SEVERAL SCHOOLS, AND THE KIND OF DENSE

[Captioner] 19:33:11
 DOWNTOWN CORE OF FREMONT, IT WILL MAKE WALKING, CYCLING AND EVEN DRIVING SAFER

[Captioner] 19:33:16
 IN FREMONT.
FINALLY, I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE CITY OF FREMONT PUBLIC

[Captioner] 19:33:23
 WORKS DEPARTMENT FOR THEIR WORK ON THESE AND OTHER PROJECTS.
THEY HAVE BEEN INCREDIBLY RESPONSIVE 

[Captioner] 19:33:29
TO FEEDBACK, AND HAVE BEEN PUTTING A LOT OF HARD WORK TO MAKE THESE PROJECTS COME TO LIFE.


[Captioner] 19:33:34
WITH THAT, I CEDE MY TIME.


[Captioner] 19:33:40
>> Ms. Gauthier: THERE'S NO ADDITIONAL SPEAKERS.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:33:45
AT THIS TIME, I SEE COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN?
>> Councilmember Salwan: THANK YOU, 

[Captioner] 19:33:51
MADAME MAYOR.
APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS.
I WAS WONDERING IF MR. LARSEN

[Captioner] 19:33:55
 COULD COMMENT ON THE EAST BAY GREENWAY TRAIL.
AND KIND OF HOW THAT'S GOING TO

[Captioner] 19:33:58
 RUN AND HOW DO WE CONNECT THE TWO POINTS.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:34:13
>> Mayor Mei: WELCOME.
>> GOOD AFTERNOON, MEMBERS OF COUNCIL.


[Captioner] 19:34:19
SO JUST A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND ON THE EAST BAY GREENWAY TRAIL.
SO THIS IS A REALLY

[Captioner] 19:34:24
 EXCITING FEATURE IN THE EAST BAY.
IT EXTENDS FROM -- ULTIMATELY FROM OAKLAND THROUGH

[Captioner] 19:34:28
 FREMONT, SO THERE'S LOTS OF DIFFERENT PIECES OF IT THAT ARE BEING DEVELOPED.


[Captioner] 19:34:35
WHAT IS ON THE AGENDA TODAY IS DEVELOPING A SECTION OF THE TRAIL

[Captioner] 19:34:40
 THAT BASICALLY WOULD LINK THE IRVINGTON BART STATION

[Captioner] 19:34:45
 AREA NORTH TO THE FREMONT BART STATION AREA.
SO THE PORTION THAT WAS MENTIONED BY

[Captioner] 19:34:50
 SOME OF THE SPEAKERS IS A PORTION THAT WOULD GO FROM THE FREMONT BART

[Captioner] 19:34:55
 STATION TOWARDS THE UNION CITY BART STATION, SO WE'RE NOT LOOKING AT THAT ONE RIGHT NOW, AND

[Captioner] 19:35:00
 ADMITTEDLY THAT IS IN AN AREA WHERE LOTS OF DIFFERENT ALIGNMENTS HAVE BEEN LOOKED AT.


[Captioner] 19:35:06
WE DON'T HAVE A PREFERRED ALIGNMENT YET, BUT THAT WOULD BE SUBJECT

[Captioner] 19:35:11
 TO FUTURE STUDIES.
I JUST WANT TO KIND OF HIGHLIGHT SORT OF ONE OF THE REASONS WHY

[Captioner] 19:35:16
 WE'RE ADVANCING THE FREMONT BART TO IRVINGTON STATION.


[Captioner] 19:35:21
PART OF THIS IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE FACT THE REALITY IS

[Captioner] 19:35:26
 THAT THE IRVINGTON BART STATION IS NOT GOING TO BE DEVELOPED SORT OF IN THE

[Captioner] 19:35:30
 IMMEDIATE NEAR TERM, AND MEANWHILE THERE'S A LOT OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT'S GOING IN THE AREA.


[Captioner] 19:35:36
AND WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS PROVIDE AN ALTERNATIVE FOR FOLKS THAT ARE

[Captioner] 19:35:41
 LIVING IN THE IRVINGTON AREA NOW OR MOVING INTO THE IRVINGTON AREA IN THE FUTURE TO HAVE A

[Captioner] 19:35:46
 REALLY NICE LINK TO BART SYSTEM AND HAVE

[Captioner] 19:35:51
 A NICE TRAIL ENVIRONMENT THAT THEY COULD WALK OR BICYCLE ON TO DOWNTOWN FREMONT AND THE

[Captioner] 19:35:54
 STATION, SO THAT'S WHY WE'RE ADVOCATING DEVELOPING THIS PROJECT AT THIS TIME.


[Captioner] 19:36:00
WE'RE APPRECIATIVE OF ALAMEDA CTC AND ALLOCATING MONEY FOR US TO BOTH PLAN

[Captioner] 19:36:05
 AND DESIGN THE PROJECT, SO THAT WE CAN THEN TRY TO

[Captioner] 19:36:09
 CAPITALIZE ON CAPITALIZING GRANTS OR OTHER SOURCES IN THE FUTURE.
HAPPY TO TAKE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS THAT 

[Captioner] 19:36:13
COUNCIL HAS.
>> Councilmember Salwan: SO IS THERE ANY HIGH LEVEL IDEA LIKE HOW IT'S 

[Captioner] 19:36:18
GOING TO RUN BETWEEN THE TWO AREAS?


[Captioner] 19:36:25
>> SO A PART OF THE TRAIL ALREADY EXISTS SO FROM CENTRAL

[Captioner] 19:36:30
 PARK SOUTH TO CLOSE TO IRVINGTON, AND SO THIS WOULD ESSENTIALLY CLOSE A

[Captioner] 19:36:36
 GAP IN THE SOUTHERN AREA, AND THEN THE PROPOSED ALIGNMENT, WE

[Captioner] 19:36:41
 ACTUALLY ARE SEEING A COUPLE OF ROUTES THAT PEOPLE COULD TAKE AROUND CENTRAL PARK TO GET TO THE FREMONT

[Captioner] 19:36:46
 BART STATION OR NORTH.
SO ONE, A ROUTE IS

[Captioner] 19:36:52
 CONTINUING UP THROUGH THE EAST SIDE OF CENTRAL PARK

[Captioner] 19:36:56
 UP TO STEVENSON.
THAT GENERALLY FOLLOWS THE RAILROAD CORRIDOR.


[Captioner] 19:37:01
THAT'S A PROJECT THAT'S BEING DEVELOPED BY OUR

[Captioner] 19:37:06
 PARK CIP.
THIS PROJECT WOULD TAKE A LOOK AT

[Captioner] 19:37:11
 CROSSING OVER PASEO PADRE PARKWAY AND THEN RUNNING AN IMPROVED

[Captioner] 19:37:16
 CORRIDOR ALONG PASEO PADRE PARKWAY ALONG THE WEST SIDE OF CENTRAL

[Captioner] 19:37:21
 PARK, UP BY THE LIBRARY ON STEVENSON, AND THEN TYING INTO THE LITTLE TRAIL

[Captioner] 19:37:26
 SYSTEM THAT'S CLOSE TO THE BART SYSTEM.
SO THE INTENT IS TO CREATE THIS AREA 

[Captioner] 19:37:31
AND SO NOT ONLY DOES IT CONNECT TO THE FREMONT BART STATION, BUT FOLKS THAT ARE LIVING IN THE

[Captioner] 19:37:37
 IRVINGTON -- FUTURE IRVINGTON BART STATION AREA WOULD HAVE VERY EASY ACCESS TO CENTRAL

[Captioner] 19:37:40
 PARK, THE LIBRARY AND SOME OF THE OTHER ASSETS IN THE DOWNTOWN FREMONT AREA.


[Captioner] 19:37:47
>> Councilmember Salwan: THANK YOU.
WELL, I DO SUPPORT IT BECAUSE WE'RE GETTING MONEY FROM ACTC AND THEY'RE

[Captioner] 19:37:52
 NOT GIVING US MUCH MONEY LATELY SO WE NEED TO TAKE WHAT WE CAN, SO I'LL BE HAPPY TO SUPPORT

[Captioner] 19:37:54
 THIS.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
NEXT I HAVE COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL.


[Captioner] 19:38:02
>> Councilmember Campbell: THANK YOU.
AND THANK YOU FOR RESPONDING TO SOME OF MY QUESTIONS EARLIER.


[Captioner] 19:38:08
I HAVE ONE QUESTION ABOUT THIS ONE, BASED ON THE PUBLIC COMMENT,

[Captioner] 19:38:13
 AND THEN THE SECOND ONE ABOUT THE RAISED --

[Captioner] 19:38:16
 ELEVATED BIKEWAYS, THE SECOND QUESTION.
SO THE FIRST ONE IS THE CONTAMINANT.


[Captioner] 19:38:21
I SEE IN THE SCHEDULE THAT YOU SENT ME THAT THERE HAS ALREADY BEEN AN ENVIRONMENTAL CLEARANCE

[Captioner] 19:38:27
 FOR THIS PARTICULAR AREA ALREADY.
IS

[Captioner] 19:38:32
 THERE SOME CONCERN AROUND THE GREENWAY TRAIL AND CONTAMINANTS?


[Captioner] 19:38:40
>> Mr. Larsen: SO THE AREA WHERE THERE'S CONCERN ABOUT CONTAMINANT IS

[Captioner] 19:38:44
 A DIFFERENT SEGMENT THAN WHAT'S ON THE AGENDA HERE TODAY, SO THAT IS A

[Captioner] 19:38:50
 SECTION -- SO GENERALLY THE EAST BAY GREENWAY FOLLOWS AN ALIGNMENT FROM

[Captioner] 19:38:55
 OAKLAND THROUGH FREMONT THAT RUNS CLOSE TO THE BART STATIONS IN THE

[Captioner] 19:39:00
 CORRIDOR.
SO THE AREA WHERE THERE'S AN UNCERTAIN ALIGNMENT WHERE THERE'S

[Captioner] 19:39:05
 BEEN STUDIES OF CORRIDORS,

[Captioner] 19:39:11
 WHERE THERE'S CONCERN OF CONTAMINANTS IS IN THE AREA THAT'S FROM THE FREMONT

[Captioner] 19:39:16
 BART STATION NORTH TOWARDS THE UNION CITY BART STATION.
SO WE ARE NOT WORKING ON THAT PIECE

[Captioner] 19:39:21
 AT THIS TIME.
WE WOULD LIKE TO IF WE HAD SOME OTHER

[Captioner] 19:39:26
 RESOURCES BUT WE'RE PRIORITIZING OUR EFFORTS REALLY TO GET CONNECTION FROM THE IRVINGTON AREA TO

[Captioner] 19:39:32
 THE EXISTING FREMONT BART STATION.
SO THAT'S A SEPARATE EFFORT AND NOT PART

[Captioner] 19:39:37
 OF THIS ACTION HERE TODAY.
>> Councilmember Campbell: OKAY.
AND I THINK YOU ALSO MENTIONED THAT 

[Captioner] 19:39:42
HOPEFULLY IF THE FUNDING IS AVAILABLE, THAT WE WOULD SEE THE IRVINGTON BART STATION

[Captioner] 19:39:48
 SOMETIME IN 2031?


[Captioner] 19:39:51
>> Mr. Larsen: THAT IS OUR CURRENT GOAL, SUBJECT TO FUNDING AVAILABILITY.


[Captioner] 19:39:57
SO THE IRVINGTON BART STATION IS AT AN ADVANCED STATE OF

[Captioner] 19:40:02
 DEVELOPMENT.
WE ARE ACTIVELY WORKING TO TRY TO GET FULL FUNDING FOR

[Captioner] 19:40:05
 THAT.
SO THE PROJECT IS ALMOST COMPLETELY DESIGNED.


[Captioner] 19:40:11
IT HAS ENVIRONMENTAL CLEARANCE.
THERE'S A FEW PROPERTIES THAT WE NEED TO

[Captioner] 19:40:16
 ACQUIRE, BUT WE'RE LOOKING AT A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT OPTIONS TO BE ABLE TO PAY FOR THE CONSTRUCTION.


[Captioner] 19:40:21
SO THAT'S THE KEY CHALLENGE FOR THAT.
BUT EVEN IF WE HAD THE MONEY FOR

[Captioner] 19:40:30
 IT, LIKELY BEST CASE WOULD BE A COUPLE YEARS BEFORE WE START CONSTRUCTION, AND THEN IT'S

[Captioner] 19:40:35
 ABOUT A FOUR-YEAR CONSTRUCTION PERIOD, SO

[Captioner] 19:40:40
 EVEN THE BEST CASE, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A LOT OF DEVELOPMENT COMING IN AROUND

[Captioner] 19:40:46
 THE AREA WITHOUT THE STATION, SO THIS CONCEPT OF

[Captioner] 19:40:52
 BUILDING THE GREENWAY AT AN EARLIER TIME FRAME IS A WAY TO PROVIDE BETTER CIRCULATION TO THAT

[Captioner] 19:40:54
 PART OF THE FREMONT COMMUNITY.
>> Councilmember Campbell: I GET THAT.


[Captioner] 19:41:00
AND THAT WAS ONE OF MY CONCERNS, WHY ARE WE DOING ALL OF THIS DEVELOPMENT AROUND THE

[Captioner] 19:41:05
 AREA AND WE'RE NOT LOOKING FOR THE STATION TO OPEN UNTIL 2031 IF WE GET THE

[Captioner] 19:41:07
 FUNDING.
BUT I HEAR YOUR POINT AND IT IS WELL TAKEN.


[Captioner] 19:41:12
THANK YOU FOR THAT.
I'M JUST GOING TO MOVE ON REAL QUICK

[Captioner] 19:41:18
 WITH THE ELEVATED BIKEWAYS.
I DID GET THE LINK AND I

[Captioner] 19:41:25
 LOOKED AT THE RENDERINGS THAT YOU SHOWED ME AND THEY REALLY LOOK NICE.
I THINK THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING

[Captioner] 19:41:30
 REALLY GREAT FOR THAT AREA.
MY QUESTION IS, IS THAT --

[Captioner] 19:41:35
 WHAT ABOUT THE PASEO PADRE CORRIDOR?
I MEAN, THAT SEEMS LIKE IT'S

[Captioner] 19:41:40
 VERY, VERY DANGEROUS.
I SAW A KID RIDING A BICYCLE ON PASEO PADRE AND THEY WERE WIGGLING AND THE 

[Captioner] 19:41:46
CARS WERE GOING 50 MILES AN HOUR DOWN THROUGH THERE.
SO I'M WONDERING IF THERE'S ANY --

[Captioner] 19:41:51
 FOR THE ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION PLAN THAT YOU SAID THAT IS CURRENTLY UNDERWAY IN DEVELOPMENT, IS THERE ANY

[Captioner] 19:41:56
 PLANS TO DO THE SAME TYPE OF BICYCLE LANES ON PASEO PADRE?


[Captioner] 19:42:02
>> Mr. Larsen: SO THAT'S A QUESTION THAT WE'LL HOPEFULLY

[Captioner] 19:42:07
 ANSWER AS PART OF THE UPDATED ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION PLAN.
SO IT

[Captioner] 19:42:13
 IS A NEW DESIGN STANDARD THAT'S BEEN ADOPTED

[Captioner] 19:42:18
 NATIONALLY, A LOT OF CITIES IN THE COUNTRY ARE BUILDING ELEVATED

[Captioner] 19:42:24
 BIKE LANES.
WHAT THAT ESSENTIALLY MEANS IS ELEVATING THE

[Captioner] 19:42:29
 BIKEWAY 6 INCHES UP FROM -- AND THE DIFFERENCE THERE IS THAT THE BIKEWAY

[Captioner] 19:42:34
 IS AT THE SAME LEVEL AS THE SIDEWALK WITH A CURB SEPARATING THE MOVING

[Captioner] 19:42:39
 CARS AS OPPOSED TO HAVING THE BICYCLES BE AT THE SAME LEVEL AS THE MOVING

[Captioner] 19:42:45
 CARS.
SO THE IDEA IS WHERE YOU MAY HAVE A BIKE LANE ON THE STREET, YOU ELEVATE

[Captioner] 19:42:50
 IT UP TO THE SIDEWALK LEVEL, IT'S SEPARATED FROM WHERE THE PEDESTRIANS ARE.


[Captioner] 19:42:56
AND THAT'S CONSIDERED A DESIGN STANDARD, IT'S COMMON IN SOME

[Captioner] 19:43:01
 EUROPEAN COUNTRIES WHERE THEY HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE RIDING BIKES BECAUSE PEOPLE

[Captioner] 19:43:06
 FEEL SAFER, MORE COMFORTABLE.
IT'S ALSO REFERRED TO AS AN ALL AGES AND

[Captioner] 19:43:11
 ABILITY NETWORK, SO WE HAVE STARTED THAT ON

[Captioner] 19:43:17
 WALNUT AND THAT HAS BEEN VERY WELL RECEIVED.
OUR CURRENT BIKE MASTER PLAN

[Captioner] 19:43:22
 ENVISIONS THAT KIND OF TREATMENT ON PARTS OF FREMONT BOULEVARD, AND SO THAT WOULD BE

[Captioner] 19:43:28
 LOOKED AT AS PART OF THE GRANT THAT'S ON THIS AGENDA ITEM.
SO IT AN

[Captioner] 19:43:31
 OPEN QUESTION ABOUT WHERE ELSE, YOU KNOW, THAT IS AN APPROPRIATE TREATMENT.


[Captioner] 19:43:37
AND SO THAT'S ONE OF THE QUESTIONS WE HOPE TO ANSWER AS PART OF THE UPDATED

[Captioner] 19:43:42
 ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION PLAN, WHICH ADDRESSES BOTH WALKING AND BIKING AND FOLKS THAT USE

[Captioner] 19:43:47
 WHEELCHAIRS.
>> Councilmember Campbell: THANK YOU.
I DO ALSO THINK THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE 

[Captioner] 19:43:52
ARE THINKING THAT WE HAVE LESS BICYCLERS THAT WE HAD IN THE PAST.


[Captioner] 19:43:58
ARE YOU SEEING THAT WE'RE TRENDING UP OR DOWN WITH THE BICYCLING?


[Captioner] 19:44:04
>> Mr. Larsen: UM, I'VE NOT HEARD THAT IT'S GOING DOWN.
I THINK

[Captioner] 19:44:09
 DURING COVID THERE WAS ACTUALLY A LOT MORE PEOPLE BICYCLING JUST FOR

[Captioner] 19:44:16
 EXERCISE, AND I WAS OUT FOR

[Captioner] 19:44:21
 LUNCH TODAY AND I WAS WALKING ALONG THE WALNUT BIKEWAY CORRIDOR AND THERE WERE MANY

[Captioner] 19:44:26
 PEOPLE RIDING THEIR BIKES THERE.
SO I DON'T HAVE ANY

[Captioner] 19:44:31
 SPECIFIC DATA.
WE WILL BE COLLECTING THAT AS PART OF THE ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION

[Captioner] 19:44:37
 PLAN.
I DO KNOW THAT BECAUSE THERE ARE LESS PEOPLE

[Captioner] 19:44:42
 RIDING BART AND WE DID HAVE MANY PEOPLE RIDING

[Captioner] 19:44:47
 THEIR BICYCLE TO THE FREMONT BART STATION, SORT OF BEFORE THE

[Captioner] 19:44:53
 PANDEMIC, AND SO WITH LESS BART RIDERSHIP, YOU KNOW, THERE MAY BE LESS PEOPLE TRAVELING TO THE BART STATION

[Captioner] 19:44:58
 AND RIDING THEIR BIKE THERE, THAT COULD BE A LITTLE BIT OF A DYNAMIC, BUT

[Captioner] 19:45:03
 I THINK GENERALLY AS WE'RE BUILDING MORE TRAILS AND SAFE AND COMFORTABLE

[Captioner] 19:45:08
 BIKEWAYS, WE'RE SEEING MORE PEOPLE USING THEM.
>> Councilmember Campbell: OKAY.


[Captioner] 19:45:13
I'M GLAD TO HEAR YOU WILL BE COLLECTING SOME DATA TO SUPPORT THAT BECAUSE I

[Captioner] 19:45:18
 THINK THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT AS WE CONTINUE TO THINK ABOUT WHAT AN ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION PLAN REALLY LOOKS LIKE, 

[Captioner] 19:45:23
WE NEED TO HAVE SOME DATA TO SUPPORT WHY WE'RE MAKING ALL THESE BIKE LANES AND TURN LANES AND ALL OF THESE OTHER

[Captioner] 19:45:28
 THINGS.
SO THANK YOU FOR THAT.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK

[Captioner] 19:45:33
 YOU.
I'LL MAKE SOME GENERAL COMMENTS.
I THINK THAT FROM THE PERSPECTIVE, AND 

[Captioner] 19:45:39
I WANT TO THANK COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN ALSO FOR SERVING AS MY ALTERNATE ON

[Captioner] 19:45:44
 ACTC, BUT IT CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN LONG-STANDING IN TERMS OF OUTREACH AND WANTING TO MAKE SURE THAT

[Captioner] 19:45:49
 THE COMMUNITY PARTICIPATES IN THE CONSTRUCTION AND I KNOW THAT WE HAVE ALSO IN THE PAST HAD

[Captioner] 19:45:55
 A SAFE ROUTES TO SCHOOL REVIEW, AND I HOPE THAT WE WILL DO THAT AGAIN WITH OUR

[Captioner] 19:46:00
 SCHOOL DISTRICT AS TRAFFIC PATTERNS HAVE CHANGED, AND IT'S ALSO A GREAT WAY TO CREATE

[Captioner] 19:46:05
 AWARENESS, UTILIZING THIS FUNDING IS SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT FOR US TO BE TIMELY AND ALSO I

[Captioner] 19:46:11
 WANTED TO ASK REGARDING THE QUESTION FROM COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL, WE HAD ALSO HAD A DISCUSSION

[Captioner] 19:46:16
 ABOUT PASEO PADRE IN THE PAST, AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT WAS THE

[Captioner] 19:46:21
 LANE CHANGES OR NOT HAVING LANE CHANGES BUT AS AN ALTERNATE, WE HAD TALKED ABOUT A HAWK SIGNAL, WHICH

[Captioner] 19:46:26
 WOULD BE ADDED, AND SO MAY I ASK WHAT THE TIMING IS OF THAT ON PASEO PADRE?
BECAUSE TO ALLOW

[Captioner] 19:46:32
 PARTICULARLY FOR STUDENTS CROSSING AT SOME OF THE BUSIER INTERSECTIONS.


[Captioner] 19:46:38
>> Mr. Larsen: SO I THINK YOU MAY BE REFERRING TO THE PART OF PASEO PADRE PARKWAY

[Captioner] 19:46:43
 FROM DRISCOLL TO WASHINGTON?
SO THAT'S AN AREA

[Captioner] 19:46:48
 WHERE THERE'S SOME ADDITIONAL TRAFFIC SIGNALS.
THERE IS GOING TO BE A

[Captioner] 19:46:53
 CONSIDERATION OF LOOKING AT A ROUNDABOUT ALTERNATIVE IN THERE AND SEE IF THE COMMUNITY IS INTERESTED IN

[Captioner] 19:46:59
 THAT.
AND THEN THERE'S ALSO LOCATIONS THAT HAVE ADDITIONAL EITHER

[Captioner] 19:47:04
 FLASHING BEACONS OR HAWK SIGNALS.
SO AS PART OF COUNCIL'S APPROVAL OF THE CAPITAL

[Captioner] 19:47:09
 IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM BACK IN JUNE, THERE'S MONEY SET ASIDE TO

[Captioner] 19:47:14
 DEVELOP THE PASEO PADRE PARKWAY SAFETY IMPROVEMENT CORRIDOR, WHICH IS

[Captioner] 19:47:19
 THAT PORTION FROM DRISCOLL TO WASHINGTON.
SO WE WILL BE

[Captioner] 19:47:25
 BEGINNING COMMUNITY OUTREACH AND PLANNING WORK, YOU KNOW, FOR THAT CORRIDOR IN THE COMING YEAR.


[Captioner] 19:47:32
>> Councilmember Campbell: MAYOR MEI, I'M SORRY, I DON'T MEAN TO INTERRUPT BUT I WAS ACTUALLY THINKING MORE NORTH

[Captioner] 19:47:37
 FREMONT, ISHERWOOD, UP IN THAT AREA,

[Captioner] 19:47:43
 DECOTO DOWN SOUTH INSTEAD OF -- ALMOST DOWN SOUTH

[Captioner] 19:47:46
 ALREADY.
I'M SORRY.
>> Mayor Mei: IT'S OKAY.


[Captioner] 19:47:52
I THINK THE PROJECT -- I'LL ALLOW HANS TO

[Captioner] 19:47:57
 CLARIFY, AS FAR AS THE CONCERNS ON PASEO PADRE, THE SEGMENT WHICH YOU'RE LOOKING AT, WE'RE LOOKING AT 

[Captioner] 19:48:02
SEPARATELY ON THE CONVERSATION OF DUNBAR TON ALSO IN CONJUNCTION WITH SOME OF THE EFFORTS WITH UNION

[Captioner] 19:48:07
 CITY AT LOOKING AT NORTH FREMONT, BUT I DON'T THINK FOR THIS PIECE OF IT THAT'S BEING

[Captioner] 19:48:12
 REVIEWED TODAY FOR PASEO PADRE.
IT SOUNDS LIKE IT'S SPECIFIC TO THE CORRIDOR, YOU SAID BETWEEN WALNUT

[Captioner] 19:48:18
 AND -- DRISCOLL.
AT ONE POINT THE HAWK SIGNAL I WAS TALKING ABOUT WAS

[Captioner] 19:48:25
 CLOSER TO -- I'M THINKING ABOUT -- I'M BLANKING RIGHT NOW.
>> Vice Mayor Cox:

[Captioner] 19:48:31
 THE JEWISH SYNAGOGUE, MAYOR.
>> THE TEMPLE, ACTUALLY BEFORE THAT, THERE WAS A

[Captioner] 19:48:37
 DISCUSSION, RIGHT AFTER CVS THERE, THERE WAS AN INLET

[Captioner] 19:48:42
 WHERE MANY STUDENTS CROSS AND THAT'S WHERE WE HAD TALKED ABOUT THE SPEED CONCERNS, AND ESPECIALLY THE

[Captioner] 19:48:44
 BICYCLISTS.
>> Mr. Larsen: THIS IS THE DRISCOLL TO WASHINGTON PIECE?


[Captioner] 19:48:50
>> Mayor Mei: YES.
>> Mr. Larsen: SO WE DO HAVE A PROJECT THAT'S

[Captioner] 19:48:55
 FUNDED BY THE CITY TO DEVELOP THAT PROJECT SO THAT'S IN OUR CURRENT CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM.


[Captioner] 19:48:59
>> Mayor Mei: WHAT I WAS ASKING EARLIER, CLARIFICATION, IS THE TIME FRAME.


[Captioner] 19:49:04
ORIGINALLY WE SAID ABOUT A YEAR OUT SO I'M NOT SURE IF THAT'S STILL IN --
>> Mr. Larsen: SO THE PROJECT HAS

[Captioner] 19:49:12
 FUNDING IN THE TWO-YEAR CIP, AND SO WE'LL BEGIN DOING THE DESIGN

[Captioner] 19:49:17
 WORK ON THAT THIS COMING YEAR.
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY.
SO IF THAT'S THE

[Captioner] 19:49:22
 DESIGN WORK, WE'LL BE ANOTHER --
>> Mr. Larsen: TYPICALLY DESIGN IS THE FIRST

[Captioner] 19:49:25
 YEAR AND CONSTRUCTION IS THE SECOND YEAR.
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY.


[Captioner] 19:49:31
SO THAT WOULD BE CLOSER TO 2024-25?
>> Mr. Larsen: RIGHT.
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY.


[Captioner] 19:49:37
I DO SEE SOME OF THE THINGS -- REASON WHY I WAS ASKING EARLIER WITH THE SAFE ROUTES TO SCHOOL IS

[Captioner] 19:49:42
 THAT IN THIS LAST COUPLE WEEKS, WE'VE HAD A CHANCE TO OPEN UP SOME

[Captioner] 19:49:47
 OF OUR SCHOOLS FROM JUNIOR HIGH TO MIDDLE SCHOOLS, IN PARTICULAR SOME OF THESE CORRIDORS, AND

[Captioner] 19:49:53
 SO, THEREFORE, AS PART OF THEIR TRANSITION FOR THE FACILITIES, IT ALSO INCLUDED SOME

[Captioner] 19:49:58
 BETTER, I GUESS, FLOW IN TERMS OF TRAFFIC AND ROTATIONS THROUGH THEIR

[Captioner] 19:50:02
 ROUNDABOUTS OR THEIR DROPOFF AREAS SO HOPEFULLY WHEN WE LOOK AT THIS, WE CAN INCLUDE SOME OF THOSE.


[Captioner] 19:50:07
AND I DEFINITELY WOULD SUPPORT COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL'S DISCUSSION AND I KNOW IN NORTH FREMONT WE'VE HAD 

[Captioner] 19:50:13
SOME REALLY UNFORTUNATE ACCIDENTS IN THE PAST AND I KNOW THAT'S SOMETHING AS WE LOOK THROUGH OUR DUMBARTON

[Captioner] 19:50:19
 CORRIDOR, SOME OF THE FUNDING THAT WE WERE PROJECTING FOR OVER THERE, THAT HOPEFULLY WE CAN

[Captioner] 19:50:24
 START ADDRESSING TOO.
>> Mr. Larsen: YEAH, I WOULD SAY -- PASEO PADRE CORRIDOR, YOU

[Captioner] 19:50:29
 KNOW, IT'S A VERY LONG CORRIDOR THROUGHOUT THE CITY, AND SO AS PART OF THE ACTIVE

[Captioner] 19:50:34
 TRANSPORTATION PLAN, YOU KNOW, IDENTIFYING AREAS WHERE IT'S DIFFICULT TO WALK

[Captioner] 19:50:39
 OR BIKE AND THERE'S SAFETY CONCERNS, SO IN THE NORTH FREMONT

[Captioner] 19:50:45
 AREA, THOSE ARE THINGS THAT WE'LL BE LOOKING FOR INPUT FROM

[Captioner] 19:50:50
 THE COMMUNITY, AS WELL AS OUR PROFESSIONAL ANALYSIS OF WHERE ARE THE PLACES THAT WE SHOULD BE

[Captioner] 19:50:56
 INVESTING IN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS TO MAKE WALKING AND BIKING AND

[Captioner] 19:51:01
 ROLLING EASIER AND SAFER IN FREMONT.
SO WE'LL BE LOOKING FOR WHAT

[Captioner] 19:51:06
 ARE THOSE PRIORITY PROJECTS AND THEN EITHER PURSUE GRANTS OR THEY WOULD BE

[Captioner] 19:51:11
 TOPICS OF THE NEXT ROUND OF OUR CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM.
>> Mayor Mei: I ALSO WANTED TO

[Captioner] 19:51:15
 COMMENT, I KNOW COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL YOU'D ASKED ABOUT PEOPLE THAT YOU'VE SEEN USING THE BIKE LANES, AND I 

[Captioner] 19:51:22
WANTED TO NOTE THE OTHER DAY, WE HAVE MULTIHANDICAPPED COMMUNITY MEMBERS

[Captioner] 19:51:27
 AND I'VE SEEN SOME SENIORS ALSO RIDING IN THOSE WITH THEIR VEHICLES BECAUSE IT IS PROTECTED AND I FEEL

[Captioner] 19:51:32
 LIKE I SAW SOMEBODY SHOPPING AND BUYING GROCERIES, IT

[Captioner] 19:51:36
 IS ANOTHER VIABLE OPTION FOR PEOPLE TO GET TO AND FROM.
SO THANK YOU FOR THE CLARIFYING 

[Captioner] 19:51:39
QUESTIONS.
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN?
>> Councilmember Salwan: I'D LIKE TO 

[Captioner] 19:51:43
MOVE THIS ITEM FORWARD.
>> Vice Mayor Cox: SECOND.
>> Mayor Mei: MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER 

[Captioner] 19:51:46
SALWAN.
SECONDED BY VICE MAYOR COX.
PLEASE VOTE.


[Captioner] 19:51:53
FOR ITEM 2J.


[Captioner] 19:52:00
SO PLEASE NOTE ITEM 2J IS PASSING UNANIMOUSLY WITH THE COUNCIL'S SUPPORT.


[Captioner] 19:52:09
NEXT ON OUR AGENDA THIS EVENING IS ITEM 6A.
WHICH IS TO REVISE THE CITY COUNCIL 

[Captioner] 19:52:14
HANDBOOK OF RULES AND PROCEDURES, AND I BELIEVE OUR CITY ATTORNEY ALVARADO WILL

[Captioner] 19:52:19
 PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW.
>> GOOD EVENING, MAYOR AND

[Captioner] 19:52:22
 COUNCIL.
I WILL PROVIDE A SHORT ORAL REPORT ON THIS ITEM.


[Captioner] 19:52:29
IN LINE WITH PRIOR COUNCIL DIRECTION, CITY STAFF IS BRINGING THIS ITEM BACK.


[Captioner] 19:52:33
TONIGHT THE COUNCIL WILL CONSIDER REVISIONS TO THE CITY COUNCIL HANDBOOK OF RULES AND PROCEDURES.


[Captioner] 19:52:39
THE PURPOSE OF IT IS TO AMEND THE HANDBOOK TO INCORPORATE

[Captioner] 19:52:44
 ROSENBERG'S RULES OF ORDER AS THE APPLICABLE GUIDE FOR PARLIAMENTARY PROCEDURE MOVING FORWARD.


[Captioner] 19:52:50
THE PROPOSED CHANGES ARE VISIBLE AS TRACKED CHANGES IN THE ATTACHED HANDBOOK SO THE

[Captioner] 19:52:55
 COUNCIL CAN SEE ALL OF THE PROPOSED CHANGES IN RED LINE.
BUT

[Captioner] 19:53:00
 INCLUDE THREE CHANGES THAT I'LL HIGHLIGHT.
LARGELY SPEAKING, WE ARE

[Captioner] 19:53:06
 INCORPORATING ROSENBERG'S RULES OF ORDER AS THE GOVERNING PROCEDURES.
THAT MEANS WE ARE ESSENTIALLY DELETING

[Captioner] 19:53:11
 ROBERTS RULE REFERENCES WITHIN THE HANDBOOK, AND WE ARE ATTACHING ROSENBERG'S RULES AS PART OF

[Captioner] 19:53:17
 THE MATERIALS OF COUNCIL PROCEDURES.
WE'RE

[Captioner] 19:53:21
 ALSO CONSOLIDATING A COUPLE SECTIONS THAT EXIST SO THIS IS MORE OF A FORMATTING ISSUE BUT WE'RE CREATING 

[Captioner] 19:53:27
ONE SECTION THAT DISCUSSES ALL PROCEDURAL RULES RATHER THAN HAVING A CHAPTER THAT

[Captioner] 19:53:32
 DISCUSSES IT AND AN APPENDIX THAT DISCUSSES IT.
AND LASTLY WE'RE

[Captioner] 19:53:36
 ADDING SOME COMPLIANCE LANGUAGE.
SPECIFICALLY WE'RE ADDING LANGUAGE THAT IS REQUIRED BY CALIFORNIA 

[Captioner] 19:53:42
GOVERNMENT CODE SECTION 87105 REGARDING THE DUTIES OF COUNCILMEMBERS IN CIRCUMSTANCES

[Captioner] 19:53:47
 OF CONFLICTS OF INTEREST IN COUNCIL DECISIONS.
ESSENTIALLY IT

[Captioner] 19:53:52
 REQUIRES COUNCIL TO DO THREE THINGS, TO RECUSE THEMSELVES AS YOU TYPICALLY DO AS WE DID

[Captioner] 19:53:58
 TODAY, ACCEPT IT ALSO INCLUDES THE SPECIFIC LANGUAGE WITHIN THE CODE THAT REQUIRES THAT WHEN THERE

[Captioner] 19:54:03
 IS A RECUSAL, YOU HAVE TO INDICATE WHAT THE POTENTIAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST IS FOR

[Captioner] 19:54:08
 THE PUBLIC, AND FOR ITEMS THAT ARE NOT ON CONSENT CALENDAR, YOU'RE REQUIRED TO LEAVE THE ROOM AND THOSE

[Captioner] 19:54:14
 WILL BE MARKED AS ABSTENTION.
SO WITH THAT, I'LL TURN IT BACK OVER TO THE MAYOR AND I AM

[Captioner] 19:54:16
 AVAILABLE FOR ANY QUESTIONS THE COUNCIL MAY HAVE.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:54:24

>> Mayor Mei: THIS MIGHT BE FROM BEFORE, COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN, IS THAT 

[Captioner] 19:54:30
FROM BEFORE?
OKAY.


[Captioner] 19:54:39
>> Councilmember Salwan: ON THE ABSTAIN, I NOTICE IT CHANGED FROM WHERE IT IS NOW

[Captioner] 19:54:45
 AND THE NEW RULES.
COULD YOU EXPLAIN THAT?
IF YOU ABSTAIN NOW, WHAT DOES

[Captioner] 19:54:52
 IT MEAN, AND AFTER THESE RULES GO INTO EFFECT, WHAT DOES ABSTAIN

[Captioner] 19:54:56
 MEAN?
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: SUBSTANTIVELY THE RULES HAVEN'T CHANGED.


[Captioner] 19:55:01
WHAT I DID IS REORGANIZE THE SECTION FOR CLARITY OF READ.
IT WAS TWO

[Captioner] 19:55:07
 PARAGRAPHS THAT FRANKLY WERE SUPERFLUOUS TO ONE ANOTHER, THEY

[Captioner] 19:55:11
 REPEATED THE SAME LANGUAGE.
SO THE SECTION THAT WAS ADDED HERE EXPLAINS THREE THINGS.


[Captioner] 19:55:16
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A COUNCILMEMBER FAILS TO VOTE.
THIS IS A CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE A 

[Captioner] 19:55:21
COUNCILMEMBER FAILS TO EXPRESS A VOTE.
YOUR CURRENT RULE STATES THAT IN THAT CIRCUMSTANCE, IT'S MARKED AS

[Captioner] 19:55:26
 AN AFFIRMATIVE VOTE.
SO I RESTATED THAT BUT I RESTATED IT WITH A LITTLE BIT MORE CLARITY,

[Captioner] 19:55:31
 INDICATING SPECIFICALLY THAT THIS IS A SITUATION WHERE THERE'S JUST A FAILURE TO EXPRESS A VOTE.


[Captioner] 19:55:36
NOW THAT RARELY HAPPENS NOW THAT WE'RE ON ELECTRONIC VOTING, BUT THAT'S WHAT YOUR CURRENT RULE SAYS.


[Captioner] 19:55:41
SO I JUST KEPT IT THERE, BUT UPDATED TO MAKE SURE THAT IT WAS CLEAR TO THE COUNCIL THAT YOU KNEW THE

[Captioner] 19:55:46
 CONSEQUENCES OF A FAILURE TO VOTE UNDER YOUR OWN

[Captioner] 19:55:51
 EXISTING RULES.
THE SECOND IS THAT I RESTATED WITHIN THE RULES JUST REORGANIZED THAT WHEN A 

[Captioner] 19:55:56
COUNCILMEMBER ABSTAINS, IT'S NOT MARKED AS A YES OR A NO.
IT'S GOING TO BE RECORDED AS AN 

[Captioner] 19:56:00
ABSTENTION.
AND THAT FOR LEGALLY REQUIRED ABSTENTIONS, THAT'S WHEN YOU HAVE A 

[Captioner] 19:56:04
LEGAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST, YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE STEPS THAT'S REQUIRED UNDER THE CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT CODE.


[Captioner] 19:56:10
SO SUBSTANTIVELY, IT'S THE SAME RULES WITH THE ADDITION OF THE ADDITIONAL COMPLIANCE LANGUAGE

[Captioner] 19:56:15
 UNDER THE GOVERNMENT CODE.
>> Councilmember Salwan: THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei:

[Captioner] 19:56:21
 YES, COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL.
>> Councilmember Campbell: THANK YOU.
I HAVE A COUPLE

[Captioner] 19:56:25
 OF THINGS IN TERMS OF JUST CLARIFICATION IN TERMS OF THE CHANGES.


[Captioner] 19:56:30
NOW WHEN YOU WERE JUST MENTIONING THE ABSTAINS, I WAS JUST LOOKING AT IT, AND AGAIN, THIS THING DOES

[Captioner] 19:56:36
 NOT HAVE ANY PAGE NUMBERS ON IT, SO I CANNOT TELL YOU WHAT PAGE I'M LOOKING ON FOR YOUR

[Captioner] 19:56:41
 REFERENCE IF YOU WANT TO LOOK AT IT.
BUT IT DOES SAY THAT ABSTENTIONS

[Captioner] 19:56:48
 WOULD BE TREATED AS A NO VOTE.
SO IF YOU ABSTAIN, IT

[Captioner] 19:56:53
 WOULD GO TOWARDS THE QUORUM OF THE BODY, BUT IT STILL

[Captioner] 19:56:58
 WOULD BE A NO VOTE.
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado:

[Captioner] 19:57:03
 THE SECTION -- THE RED LINE SECTION THAT IS THE NEW LANGUAGE THAT THE COUNCIL WOULD BE ADOPTING READS

[Captioner] 19:57:09
 AS FOLLOWS.
IT SAYS:  ABSTENTIONS.
A COUNCILMEMBER WHO ABSTAINS

[Captioner] 19:57:14
 DETERMINES NOT TO VOTE YES OR NO, AND SHALL BE RECORDED

[Captioner] 19:57:19
 AS AN ABSTENTION.
SO IF YOU DO NOT SAY YES OR NO, IT'S MARKED

[Captioner] 19:57:24
 AS AN ABSTENTION.
THAT'S YOUR EXISTING RULE ACTUALLY.


[Captioner] 19:57:29
WE'RE JUST CHANGING THE NUMBERING OF THAT SUBSECTION.
>> Councilmember Campbell: OKAY.


[Captioner] 19:57:35
AND IN THE OLD VERSION OF THAT RED LINE PIECE, IT HAD

[Captioner] 19:57:41
 THAT IF YOU ABSTAIN, YOU HAD TO GIVE A REASON FOR THE ABSTENTION, AND THAT HAS BEEN TAKEN OUT.


[Captioner] 19:57:46
AND I'M WONDERING WHY.
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: BECAUSE FOR PURPOSES OF

[Captioner] 19:57:50
 CLARITY, I AM BRINGING IN THE EXACT LANGUAGE FROM THE CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT CODE.


[Captioner] 19:57:56
THE WAY THAT IT WRITTEN IN THE CURRENT HANDBOOK IS NOT COMPLETELY ALIGNED WITH THE LANGUAGE

[Captioner] 19:58:00
 REQUIREMENTS UNDER GOVERNMENT CODE SECTION 87105.
>> Councilmember Campbell: SO YOU 

[Captioner] 19:58:06
DON'T HAVE TO STATE A REASON WHY YOU'RE ABSTAINING, YOU CAN JUST ABSTAIN?
>> Cty. Attny.

[Captioner] 19:58:12
 Alvarado: IF IT'S A LEGALLY REQUIRED ABSTENTION IN CIRCUMSTANCES OF

[Captioner] 19:58:17
 CONFLICT OF INTEREST, YOU HAVE TO INDICATE WHY YOU'RE ABSTAINING.
>> Councilmember Campbell: I

[Captioner] 19:58:19
 SEE.
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: IN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE YOU DO NOT HAVE A 

[Captioner] 19:58:24
FINANCIAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST BUT YOU DON'T WANT TO VOTE YES OR NO, YOU'RE NOT REQUIRED TO STATE THE REASON

[Captioner] 19:58:27
 WHY.
YOU CAN SIMPLY ABSTAIN.
>> Councilmember Campbell: BUT THAT'S 

[Captioner] 19:58:33
NOT CLEAR IN HERE.
THAT'S NOWHERE IN THIS RULES, IN THIS

[Captioner] 19:58:38
 PROCEDURE, THAT WHEN YOU ARE TO STATE A REASON FOR ABSTAINING AND WHEN YOU'RE

[Captioner] 19:58:44
 NOT.
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: SO IN THE REVISED CHAPTER 5 PROCEDURAL RULES, IN

[Captioner] 19:58:49
 THE RED LINE FORM, IF WE SCROLL DOWN TO

[Captioner] 19:58:54
 NEW SUBSECTION D,
>> Councilmember Campbell: I'M SORRY, SAY THAT AGAIN BECAUSE I'M LOOKING FOR 

[Captioner] 19:58:58
IT.
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: SURE.
AND I UNDERSTAND THAT BECAUSE OF THE 

[Captioner] 19:59:01
FORMATTING CHANGES --
>> Councilmember Campbell: AND NO PAGE NUMBERS.


[Captioner] 19:59:06
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: BUT MAYBE IT MIGHT BE HELPFUL IF I REFERENCE THE PAGE NUMBER FROM THE PACKET.


[Captioner] 19:59:11
THAT MIGHT BE HELPFUL TO EVERYONE.
>> Councilmember Campbell: OKAY.
IS

[Captioner] 19:59:17
 IT CHAPTER 4 -- I MEAN CHAPTER 5, PROCEDURAL RULES, DID I MISS IT?


[Captioner] 19:59:22
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: IF YOU GO TO PACKET PAGE 56.
>> Councilmember

[Captioner] 19:59:27
 Campbell: OKAY.
THAT'S NOT HELPFUL BUT GO AHEAD.
NOT FOR ME BECAUSE I HAVE A PIECE OF 

[Captioner] 19:59:33
PAPER.
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: OKAY.
>> Councilmember Campbell: I'LL FIND 

[Captioner] 19:59:38
IT.
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: ALL RIGHT.
THERE IS A NEW SUBSECTION

[Captioner] 19:59:42
 6 CALLED LEGAL DISQUALIFICATIONS.
>> Councilmember Campbell: YES, I SEE IT.


[Captioner] 19:59:47
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: THAT SECTION RESTATES THE RULE, THE STATUTORY

[Captioner] 19:59:52
 RULE IN GOVERNMENT CODE SECTION

[Captioner] 19:59:57
 87105 THAT DOES REQUIRE COUNCILMEMBERS TO DISCLOSE WHAT THE CONFLICT OF INTEREST IS THAT IS THE BASIS FOR THE 

[Captioner] 19:59:58
RECUSAL.
>> Councilmember Campbell: I SEE.
OKAY.


[Captioner] 20:00:04
I DIDN'T CONNECT THOSE.
OKAY.
THEN I'M OKAY WITH THE ABSTENTION

[Captioner] 20:00:10
 PIECE.
THEN I HAVE A QUESTION

[Captioner] 20:00:15
 ABOUT WHEN A MOTION IS MADE AND IT SECONDED,

[Captioner] 20:00:20
 WHEN THE CONVERSATION CAN CONTINUE OR IF IT SHOULD CONTINUE.


[Captioner] 20:00:26
SO IF WE LOOK AT THE LITTLE RULE BOOK THAT YOU

[Captioner] 20:00:31
 GOT, ON PAGE -- THIS ONE DOES HAVE A PAGE NUMBER, PAGE 3, IT SAYS

[Captioner] 20:00:37
 NUMBER 6.
AND I WAS CONCERNED ABOUT THAT BECAUSE I THINK I WAS PRETTY ADAMANT ABOUT OH, 

[Captioner] 20:00:42
WE'VE GOT TO HAVE A SECOND BEFORE WE CAN GO ON TO CONVERSATION, BUT THIS SAYS THAT

[Captioner] 20:00:48
 IT'S NOT NECESSARY THAT YOU HAVE A SECOND, IT'S

[Captioner] 20:00:55
 PREFERRED -- UH-OH.
IT DOES SAY THAT IT'S A

[Captioner] 20:01:00
 NORMALLY GOOD PRACTICE FOR A MOTION TO REQUIRE A SECOND BEFORE PROCEEDING TO ENSURE

[Captioner] 20:01:04
 THAT IT IS NOT JUST ONE MEMBER OF THE BODY WHO WAS INTERESTED IN A PARTICULAR APPROACH.


[Captioner] 20:01:11
HOWEVER, A SECOND IS NOT AN ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT.
SO

[Captioner] 20:01:16
 MY QUESTION IS, HOW DOES THIS BODY

[Captioner] 20:01:21
 WANT TO DO THIS?
DO THEY WANT TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A SECOND OR -- TO FURTHER

[Captioner] 20:01:26
 THE PROCEEDINGS OR WOULD THEY JUST WAND TO CONTINUE THE

[Captioner] 20:01:32
 WANT TO CONTINUE THE PROCEEDINGS UNTIL SOMEBODY SAYS

[Captioner] 20:01:35
 I'LL SECOND?
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: CAN YOU POINT ME TO THE PAGE YOU'RE READING?


[Captioner] 20:01:41
>> Councilmember Campbell: THE ROSENBERG RULES OF ORDER, THE ACTUAL MANUAL, AND IT'S ON

[Captioner] 20:01:47
 PAGE 3.
AND IT SAYS NUMBER 6.


[Captioner] 20:01:51
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: SO IN KIND OF THE GENERAL RULES OF PROCEDURE --
>> Councilmember Campbell: ON HOW 

[Captioner] 20:01:57
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO CONDUCT A MEETING.
IS THAT SOMETHING THAT THIS BODY WOULD LIKE

[Captioner] 20:02:03
 TO DO OR ARE WE OKAY WITH WHAT WE'RE DOING

[Captioner] 20:02:06
 NOW?
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: AND FOR THIS, I WOULD TURN IT OVER TO THE COUNCIL.


[Captioner] 20:02:12
THE COUNCIL CAN ACTUALLY MAKE ADJUSTMENTS FROM ROSENBERG'S RULINGS.


[Captioner] 20:02:17
 ROSENBERG'S RULES.
THERE IS A SECTION I INCLUDED IN THE RED LINES THAT SAYS MODIFICATIONS TO

[Captioner] 20:02:23
 ROSENBERG'S RULES, AND RIGHT NOW THERE'S TWO EXISTING SUBSECTIONS.
BOTH ARE REFLECTIVE OF COUNCIL 

[Captioner] 20:02:28
DIRECTION OR COUNCIL EXISTING POLICY.
SO FOR EXAMPLE, ONE OF THE

[Captioner] 20:02:34
 RULES THAT THE CURRENT COUNCIL HANDBOOK STATES THAT FOR WITHDRAWAL OF A

[Captioner] 20:02:39
 MOTION, A MOTION MAY BE WITHDRAWN BY THE MAKER OF THE MOTION WITHOUT CONSENT OF THE

[Captioner] 20:02:42
 COUNCILMEMBER WHO SECONDED THE MOTION.
THAT'S YOUR CURRENT RULE.


[Captioner] 20:02:47
THAT IS IN CONFLICT WITH ROSENBERG'S RULES THAT

[Captioner] 20:02:52
 REQUIRES THE PERSON WHO SECONDED THE MOTION TO CONSENT TO WITHDRAW.
IT'S PERFECT ACCEPT

[Captioner] 20:02:58
 ACCEPTABLE TO COUNCIL TO MAKE CHANGES TO ROSE BURGS RULES

[Captioner] 20:03:03
 RULES TO SUIT YOUR PROCEDURAL PREFERENCES AND WE CAN INCLUDE THAT WITHIN THE REVISED HAND BOOK.


[Captioner] 20:03:09
ANOTHER SECTION, FOR EXAMPLE, AND I THINK THIS IS A BIT MAYBE STILL IN THE AIR, WE HAD

[Captioner] 20:03:14
 A PRIOR DISCUSSION, THE COUNCIL HAD A PRIOR DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS AT THE CLOSE

[Captioner] 20:03:20
 OF PUBLIC COMMENT.
ROSE BURGS RULES

[Captioner] 20:03:26
 STATES ONE TYPE OF PROCEDURE THE COUNCIL HAS ANOTHER TYPE OF PRACTICE.
SO FOR EXAMPLE, RIGHT

[Captioner] 20:03:31
 NOW THE HANDBOOK AS REVISED WOULD SAY THAT WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE BASIC FORMAT FOR AGENDA

[Captioner] 20:03:36
 ITEM DISCUSSION, AFTER THE CLOSE OF PUBLIC COMMENT ON ANY AGENDA ITEM, THE MAYOR MEI

[Captioner] 20:03:42
 MAYOR MEI INVITE DISCUSSION PRIOR TO INITIATING A MOTION BY A

[Captioner] 20:03:46
 COUNCILMEMBER.
AS YOU WILL RECALL, THERE WAS A BIT OF COUNCIL DEBATE ABOUT WHETHER THE 

[Captioner] 20:03:51
COUNCIL WANTED TO FIRST INVITE THE MOTION AND THEN ENGAGE IN DEBATE AFTER THERE'S BEEN A

[Captioner] 20:03:56
 SECOND, OR WHETHER THE COUNCIL FIRST WANTED TO HAVE A DISCUSSION, MAYBE TO BUILD

[Captioner] 20:04:01
 CONSENSUS, BEFORE A MOTION IS PUT ON THE FLOOR.
THAT'S ANOTHER EXAMPLE THAT THE 

[Captioner] 20:04:06
COUNCIL CAN EITHER ACCEPT ROSENBERG'S WAY OF DOING IT OR CAN

[Captioner] 20:04:10
 DECIDE TO KEEP ITS EXISTING PRACTICE OF HAVING DEBATE FIRST.
>> Councilmember Campbell: NO, I DON'T 

[Captioner] 20:04:15
THINK IT SHOULD BE A HARD AND FAST RULE.
I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND

[Captioner] 20:04:21
 IN -- BECAUSE I'M A PROCESS THINKER, WHAT WOULD BE THE MOST EFFICIENT WAY FOR US TO BE ABLE

[Captioner] 20:04:26
 TO CARRY OUT THE BUSINESS.
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THAT RIGID OR STRINGENT.


[Captioner] 20:04:31
I'M NOT LOOKING FOR TO BE THAT.
I JUST WANT TO BE EFFECTIVE.
AND IF IT'S

[Captioner] 20:04:37
 EFFECTIVE, BY HAVING A QUESTION AND ANSWER SESSION BEFORE LIKE WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN DOING, THAT HE

[Captioner] 20:04:42
 OKAY.
BUT WHEN HAD COMES TO THE MOTION AND THE SECOND, TO BE ABLE TO

[Captioner] 20:04:48
 CONTINUE TO HAVE DISCUSSION, DO WE JUST WANT A MOTION AND THEN

[Captioner] 20:04:53
 DISCUSSION AND THEN A SECOND, AND THEN A VOTE, I MEAN, IT JUST SEEMS LIKE A LOT OF INEFFICIENCY TO

[Captioner] 20:04:56
 ME.
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: THAT, I WILL TURN IT OVER TO THE COUNCIL.


[Captioner] 20:04:59
THAT'S FOR THE COUNCIL TO DECIDE THIS EVENING.
>> Councilmember Campbell: OKAY.


[Captioner] 20:05:03
>> Mayor Mei: SURE, I SEE COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN.
>> Councilmember Salwan: THANK YOU 

[Captioner] 20:05:08
AGAIN, MADAME MAYOR.
SO YOU KIND OF HAD ME BUT THEN YOU KIND OF LOST ME WITH THE ABSTENTION.


[Captioner] 20:05:13
SO THE WAY I INTERPRET ABSTAIN IS LIKE YOU ARE CHOOSING NOT TO VOTE.
YOU'RE

[Captioner] 20:05:19
 NOT VOTING YES, YOU'RE NOT VOTING NO.
RECUSAL IS MORE LIKE YOU'RE

[Captioner] 20:05:24
 RECUSING BECAUSE YOU HAVE A CONFLICT., SO

[Captioner] 20:05:28
 THEN YOU SAID ABSTAIN WITH A CONFLICT.
SO WERE YOU KIND OF INTERCHANGING 

[Captioner] 20:05:33
THOSE OR IS RECUSAL A FORM OF ABSTENTION?
IN THE PAST

[Captioner] 20:05:39
 WE HAD A VERY DIFFERENT INTERPRETATION.
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: UNDER YOUR 

[Captioner] 20:05:44
EXISTING RULES, BOTH OF THOSE SITUATIONS ARE CALLED ABSTENTIONS.
THAT'S WHAT THE CURRENT HANDBOOK 

[Captioner] 20:05:50
SAYS.
WHEN WE USE THE TERM RECUSAL, WE MEAN GENERALLY SPEAKING A PERSON LEAVES THE 

[Captioner] 20:05:55
ROOM BECAUSE THEY HAVE A CONFLICT OF INTEREST, BUT WE DON'T MARK IT A RECUSAL

[Captioner] 20:06:01
 IN OUR RECORD, MEANING IF THERE'S AN ADOPTION OF A RESOLUTION, MY UNDERSTANDING

[Captioner] 20:06:06
 IS RIGHT NOW WE DON'T RECORD THAT AS A RECUSAL.
A RECUSAL IS A TERM OF

[Captioner] 20:06:12
 ART THAT YOU'LL LEAVE THE ROOM AS PART OF A LEGAL DISQUALIFICATION.
UNDER THE EXISTING

[Captioner] 20:06:18
 RULES, WE HAVE THREE SITUATIONS.
AND I'LL GO THROUGH THEM EACH

[Captioner] 20:06:23
 SEPARATELY BECAUSE I THINK IT WOULD BE HELPFUL SINCE WE ARE DEALING WITH THIS FOR THE FIRST TIME

[Captioner] 20:06:28
 REFRESHING OUR RECOLLECTIONS.
THE FIRST CIRCUMSTANCE IS A FAILURE

[Captioner] 20:06:34
 TO VOTE.
AND A FAILURE TO EXPRESS A VOTE.
MEANING WHAT HAPPENS IF A

[Captioner] 20:06:39
 COUNCILMEMBER IN RESPONSE TO

[Captioner] 20:06:44
 A ACTION DECIDES NOT TO EXPRESS YES OR NO.
YOUR CURRENT RULE, YOUR CURRENT 

[Captioner] 20:06:49
HANDBOOK SAYS THAT THAT'S ACTUALLY MARKED AS A YES VOTE.
>> Councilmember Salwan: SO THAT MEANS

[Captioner] 20:06:54
 YOU DON'T SAY ANYTHING, YOU JUST --
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: YOU JUST SIT THERE, MAKE NO

[Captioner] 20:07:01
 MOVEMENT, NO EXPRESSION, THAT'S MARKED AS A YES VOTE NOW UNDER YOUR CURRENT HANDBOOK.


[Captioner] 20:07:07
THAT RULE REMAINS THE SAME UNDER THE REVISED RULE.
IT'S NOT CHANGING.


[Captioner] 20:07:12
>> Councilmember Salwan: OKAY.
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: THE SECOND IS, A COUNCILMEMBER

[Captioner] 20:07:18
 WHO DETERMINES NOT TO VOTE YES OR NO BUT WANTS TO ABSTAIN CAN SAY

[Captioner] 20:07:23
 I ABSTAIN.
AND THAT'S MARKED AS AN ABSTENTION.
IN THAT CIRCUMSTANCE, THERE

[Captioner] 20:07:28
 IS AN EXPRESSION OF A DESIRE TO VOTE, BUT THAT EXPRESSION IS TO ABSTAIN, NOT

[Captioner] 20:07:33
 TO VOTE YES OR NO.
YOU CAN DO THAT UNDER YOUR CURRENT RULES AND UNDER THE FUTURE RULES IF 

[Captioner] 20:07:38
THE COUNCIL WERE TO ADOPT THIS HANDBOOK.
THE LAST

[Captioner] 20:07:44
 TYPE OF ABSTENTION, I'M CALLING IT A DISQUALIFICATION FOR PURPOSES OF

[Captioner] 20:07:49
 CLARITY UNDER THE REVISED RULE.
IT'S CALLED A LEGALLY REQUIRED ABSTENTION UNDER YOUR

[Captioner] 20:07:55
 EXISTING RULES, BUT IT DOESN'T REFLECT THAT IT'S ACTUALLY A GOVERNMENT CODE REQUIREMENT THAT

[Captioner] 20:08:00
 YOU NOT ONLY MARK IT AS AN ABSTENTION, BUT THAT YOU LEAVE THE ROOM.
SO WHAT WE'RE DOING IS

[Captioner] 20:08:05
 WE'RE SIMPLY INCORPORATING THE STATUTORY LANGUAGE, THE LANGUAGE ITSELF THAT YOU FIND IN THE STATUTE,

[Captioner] 20:08:11
 WE'RE JUST COPY-PASTING THAT INTO YOUR PROCEDURAL RULES TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT FOR

[Captioner] 20:08:16
 DISQUALIFICATIONS, MEANING WHEN YOU HAVE A LEGALLY REQUIRED

[Captioner] 20:08:21
 DISQUALIFICATION DUE TO CONFLICT OF INTEREST, WE'RE GOING TO MARK IT AS AN ABSTENTION, AND YOU'RE REQUIRED

[Captioner] 20:08:26
 TO RECUSE YOURSELF BY LEAVING THE ROOM.


[Captioner] 20:08:31
>> Councilmember Salwan: SO

[Captioner] 20:08:37
 AGAIN, WE CAN LOOK AT THE MINUTES BUT I SORT OF GET THE FEELING THAT WE HAVE FOUR CATEGORIES RATE

[Captioner] 20:08:42
 NOW, AYE, NAY, ABSTENTION AND RECUSAL.
IS THAT CORRECT, MADAM CITY CLERK?


[Captioner] 20:08:47
>> Ms. Gauthier: WHEN I'VE REFLECTED IT IN THE MINUTES, WHEN YOU'VE STATED THAT YOU'RE GOING TO --

[Captioner] 20:08:53
 YOU'RE RECUSING YOURSELF, I HAVE PUT THE WORD

[Captioner] 20:08:59
 "RECUSE" FOR PROPERTY -- I CAN'T RECALL SOME OF THE REASONS THAT YOU'VE PUT IN, BUT IN THE MINUTES THEY'RE 

[Captioner] 20:09:04
REFLECTED THAT WAY.
BUT AS FAR AS THE ORDINANCE AND THE RESOLUTIONS THAT I

[Captioner] 20:09:10
 RECEIVE FROM THE ATTORNEY'S OFFICE, THEY MARK IT AS AN ABSTENTION.
THEY DON'T USE THE WORD

[Captioner] 20:09:15
 "RECUSE" OR "RECUSAL" ON THOSE DOCUMENTS.
I'VE USED IT INTERCHANGEABLY ON THE

[Captioner] 20:09:20
 MINUTES.
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: AND THAT'S ACCEPTABLE FOR PURPOSES OF THE

[Captioner] 20:09:24
 MINUTES.
>> Councilmember Salwan: OKAY.
THIS IS A GOOD DISCUSSION BECAUSE I 

[Captioner] 20:09:29
SIT ON OTHER BOARDS TOO AND WE KIND OF TRY TO SEPARATE IT OUT.
AND I'VE EVEN HEARD PEOPLE SAY YOU

[Captioner] 20:09:34
 CAN'T ABSTAIN, YOU HAVE TO VOTE.
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: I WOULD

[Captioner] 20:09:40
 DISAGREE WITH THAT TO THE EXTENT THAT COUNCILMEMBERS HAVE FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS, FREEDOM

[Captioner] 20:09:45
 OF EXPRESSION.
YOU CAN CHOOSE HOW TO VOTE.
I MEAN, YOUR PROCEDURAL RULES

[Captioner] 20:09:51
 WILL TELL YOU HERE, FOR EXAMPLE, WHAT HAPPENS IF NO VOTE IS EXPRESSED BECAUSE THE COUNCIL HAS AGREED 

[Captioner] 20:09:56
ESSENTIALLY THROUGH ITS RULES THAT WHAT THAT MEANS, HOW THAT'S INTERPRETED.
BUT I

[Captioner] 20:10:02
 THINK THAT THE COUNCIL IS ALSO REFLECTING WITHIN THE HANDBOOK THAT IT RECOGNIZES THAT YOU

[Captioner] 20:10:06
 HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO VOTE.
IT SAYS THAT.
COUNCILMEMBERS HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY 

[Captioner] 20:10:08
TO VOTE.
>> Councilmember Salwan: YES.
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: BUT THERE'S 

[Captioner] 20:10:14
NO ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM TO DO THAT.
>> Councilmember Salwan: THANK YOU.
WELL, SO

[Captioner] 20:10:18
 I APPRECIATE, THAT WAS A GOOD DISCUSSION.
SO I DO LIKE THE IDEA OF IF YOU'RE 

[Captioner] 20:10:24
GOING TO ABSTAIN, YOU SHOULD STATE THE REASON, I THINK WE SHOULD REQUIRE COUNCILMEMBERS TO SAY

[Captioner] 20:10:29
 WHY THEY'RE ABSTAINING.
AND JUST BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, WE CAN ABSTAIN ON ANY

[Captioner] 20:10:34
 DIFFICULT DECISION.
SO I THINK THERE SHOULD BE SOME MECHANISM WHERE

[Captioner] 20:10:39
 COUNCILMEMBERS SHOULD VOTE YES, NO, OR RECUSE, REQUIRED RECUSAL.
AND THEN

[Captioner] 20:10:44
 REGARDING THE OTHER QUESTION ABOUT THE MOTION, IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO HAVE

[Captioner] 20:10:50
 THE PERSON WHO SECONDED ALSO AGREE TO WITHDRAW THE MOTION.
I THINK THE MAKER OF THE MOTION SHOULD 

[Captioner] 20:10:55
BE ABLE TO WITHDRAW IT BECAUSE IT'S THEIR MOTION.
SO THINK WE SHOULD --

[Captioner] 20:11:00
 I DEFER THERE AS WELL.
AND THEN REGARDING WHETHER TO HAVE DISCUSSION OR GO STRAIGHT TO THE 

[Captioner] 20:11:05
MOTION, I THINK IN GENERAL, I THINK IT'S MORE -- IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S MORE EFFICIENT TO DO THE MOTION AND THE 

[Captioner] 20:11:11
SECOND, BUT IN PRACTICALITY, YOU FOUND THAT IT KIND OF THROWS PEOPLE OFF AND YOU SPEND MORE TIME TRYING TO

[Captioner] 20:11:16
 DRAFT DIFFERENT MOTIONS.
IT BETTER JUST TO HAVE A DISCUSSION SO THAT EVERYBODY CAN SAY WHERE THEY'RE

[Captioner] 20:11:21
 AT, YOU LOOK AT WHERE THE CONSENSUS IS AND THEN YOU GET A MOTION THAT'S LIKELY TO PASS.


[Captioner] 20:11:26
SO THOSE ARE SOME THINGS I'D LIKE TO SEE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:11:37
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
>> Councilmember Campbell: I HADN'T QUITE FINISHED, BUT THEN YOU CALLED ON 

[Captioner] 20:11:39
RAJ.
>> Mayor Mei: I APOLOGIZE.
I THOUGHT YOU WERE FINISHED SO I 

[Captioner] 20:11:42
WANTED TO HEAR FROM THE OTHER ONES.
>> Councilmember Campbell: THAT'S OKAY.


[Captioner] 20:11:44
I CAN COME BACK BECAUSE I DO HAVE MORE.
GO AHEAD NOW?


[Captioner] 20:11:50
OKAY.
SO I WANTED TO ASK, AND I AGREE WITH YOU, I THINK IT'S

[Captioner] 20:11:56
 PROBABLY A GREAT IDEA TO HAVE THE DISCUSSION AND THEN MAKE THE MOTION AND A SECOND AND THEN

[Captioner] 20:12:01
 SEE IF ANYBODY HAS ANY ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION, BECAUSE THEN YOU CAN SEE WHERE YOUR OTHER -- HEAR FROM YOUR

[Captioner] 20:12:06
 OTHER COUNCILMEMBERS FIRST, AND GET A SENSE OF WHERE EVERYONE IS AT.
I LIKE

[Captioner] 20:12:12
 THAT IDEA ALSO.
BUT ONCE THE VOTE IS FINALIZED, THIS GOES BACK TO RAFAEL AGAIN,

[Captioner] 20:12:17
 PLEASE, ONCE THE VOTE IS FINALIZED, I DIDN'T SEE, AND IT MAY BE BUT IT

[Captioner] 20:12:23
 WAS IN THE RULES, THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO FURTHER DISCUSSION.


[Captioner] 20:12:29
IT'S DONE.
THE MOTION, THE VOTE HAS BEEN

[Captioner] 20:12:34
 TAKEN, AND IT SAYS THE VOTE IS FINALIZED, YOU DON'T HAVE TO

[Captioner] 20:12:38
 THEN GO BACK AND EXPLAIN THE REASON WHY YOU VOTED THE WAY YOU VOTED, IT'S FINALIZED.


[Captioner] 20:12:45
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: YES, WITH ONE CAVEAT UNDER PROCEDURAL RULES,

[Captioner] 20:12:50
 WHETHER IT'S ROBERT'S OR ROSENBERG'S RULES, THE COUNCIL COULD CONSIDER A MOTION TO

[Captioner] 20:12:55
 RECONSIDER AN ITEM, BUT SHORT OF THAT, ONCE THE VOTE IS FINAL, THE MAYOR, THE

[Captioner] 20:12:58
 CHAIR, SHOULD MOVE ON TO THE NEXT ITEM.
>> Councilmember Campbell: OKAY.


[Captioner] 20:13:03
>> Mayor Mei: YES.
>> Councilmember Campbell: OKAY.
AND -- I'M SORRY, ABOUT

[Captioner] 20:13:09
 THE VOTING AGAIN.
DOES THAT MEAN THAT -- COUNTING THE VOTES, NOT THE

[Captioner] 20:13:14
 VOTING BUT THE COUNTING OF THE VOTES, THERE WAS A LOT OF DISCUSSION IN HIS HANDBOOK

[Captioner] 20:13:19
 ABOUT WHETHER YOU WERE IN THE ROOM OR NOT IN THE ROOM WHEN THE

[Captioner] 20:13:24
 VOTE WAS TAKEN AS TO HOW YOU'RE COUNTING THEM BECAUSE OF ONE-THIRD, WHATEVER -- IT

[Captioner] 20:13:29
 WAS KIND OF COMPLICATED.
WE COUNT OUR VOTES BASED ON THE PEOPLE

[Captioner] 20:13:32
 THAT ARE IN THE ROOM.
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: CORRECT.
>> Councilmember Campbell: OKAY.


[Captioner] 20:13:37
BUT THAT'S NOT STATED IN OUR HANDBOOK EITHER.
I DON'T KNOW IF WE NEED TO, BUT IT 

[Captioner] 20:13:42
DOES BEG THE QUESTION OF HOW WE'RE COUNTING VOTES.


[Captioner] 20:13:47
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: I DON'T KNOW THAT I WOULD SAY THAT WOULD BE AN ABSOLUTE NECESSITY, PARTICULARLY SINCE 

[Captioner] 20:13:52
WE LIVE IN A WORLD WHERE WE TELECONFERENCE AS WELL, SO IN THE

[Captioner] 20:13:57
 ROOM CAN HAVE VARIOUS MEANINGS, YOU KNOW, BASED UPON TECHNOLOGY AND I THINK THE EXISTING PRACTICE SEEMS TO

[Captioner] 20:14:03
 WORK.
>> Councilmember Campbell: NO, I THINK IT'S ALSO -- BUT IT JUST BROUGHT A

[Captioner] 20:14:07
 QUESTION UP BECAUSE OF THE COUNTING OF THE VOTE.
BECAUSE WE USE THE ELECTRONIC VERSION 

[Captioner] 20:14:13
OF IT, SO WE CAN SEE QUICKLY.
AND THEN THE ONLY OTHER THING THAT

[Captioner] 20:14:19
 I HAD -- THE LAST THING, I PROMISE, IS I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE MOTION COMPARISON

[Captioner] 20:14:24
 CHART, AND WHAT WE WOULD WANT TO DO WITH IT.
WHAT IS IT -- BECAUSE

[Captioner] 20:14:30
 IT SAYS THE FREMONT HANDBOOK VERSUS THE

[Captioner] 20:14:36
 ROSENBERG RULES OF ORDER.
IS THERE AN ASK TO THIS CHART?


[Captioner] 20:14:41
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: NO, THERE'S NO ASK.
THIS IS A CHART THAT WAS CREATED IN 

[Captioner] 20:14:47
RESPONSE TO VICE MAYOR COX' DESIRE TO HAVE A CHART THAT

[Captioner] 20:14:52
 INDICATES WHERE THE DIFFERENCES IN MOTION PRACTICES BETWEEN ROBERT'S RULES, THE

[Captioner] 20:14:57
 FREMONT HANDBOOK, AND ROSENBERG'S RULES.
THIS CHART REFLECTS THOSE CHANGES AS 

[Captioner] 20:15:03
YOU WILL SEE, THERE'S REALLY NOT A LOT OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ROSENBERG'S RULES AND ROBERT'S RULES WHEN IT

[Captioner] 20:15:09
 COMES TO HOW MOTIONS ARE MADE.
THERE'S ACTUALLY MORE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE

[Captioner] 20:15:14
 CURRENT COUNCIL PROCESS AND BOTH ROSENBERG'S RULES AND ROBERT'S RULES.


[Captioner] 20:15:20
SO THAT'S WHAT THIS CHART DEPICTS.
IT'S

[Captioner] 20:15:25
 SIMPLY FOR DEMONSTRATION PURPOSES.
THERE'S NO ASK RELATED TO THIS CHART.


[Captioner] 20:15:30
THE COUNCIL -- THE RECOMMENDATION TONIGHT IS BASED UPON PRIOR COUNCIL DIRECTION

[Captioner] 20:15:35
 TO INCORPORATE ROSENBERG'S RULES SO YOUR RULES WOULD ESSENTIALLY LOOK LIKE THE BOTTOM TABLE.


[Captioner] 20:15:40
THAT'S WHAT YOUR NEW RULES WOULD BE.
>> Councilmember Campbell: OKAY.
OKAY.


[Captioner] 20:15:46
THANK YOU.
OH, THANK YOU FOR -- I KNOW THIS WAS MY REFERRAL, SO THANK

[Captioner] 20:15:49
 YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BACK.
I APPRECIATE IT.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:15:54
I APOLOGIZE BECAUSE USUALLY I ASK FOR CLARIFYING QUESTIONS AND THEN WE HAVE DISCUSSION, BUT I BELIEVE WE HAVE A 

[Captioner] 20:15:58
SPEAKER ON THIS ITEM TOO.
SO IF WE COULD CALL THE SPEAKER.
>> Ms. Gauthier: WE DO.


[Captioner] 20:16:03
JOHN HINDS.
>> Mayor Mei: WELCOME, MR. HINDS.


[Captioner] 20:16:11
>> OKAY.
WITHOUT EVEN HAVING KNOWN WHAT THE OFFICIAL

[Captioner] 20:16:17
 RULES WERE, JUST FROM WATCHING THE COUNCIL FOR A WHILE, YOU CAN SORT OF SEE WHAT THE DE FACTO RULES HAVE 

[Captioner] 20:16:21
BEEN.
YOU START WITH A PRESENTATION, THEN THERE'S CLARIFYING QUESTIONS, COMMENTS 

[Captioner] 20:16:26
FROM THE PUBLIC, AND COMMENTS FROM COUNCIL.
AND IT REALLY HAS STARTED OUT AS 

[Captioner] 20:16:30
COMMENTS.
I LIKE TO SEE MORE OF THIS.
I THINK WE HAVE TO DO THAT BUT LET'S 

[Captioner] 20:16:35
AVOID THIS OTHER THING.
AND THERE'S A PERIOD OF A COUPLE MINUTES WHERE IT'S A -- LIKE PEOPLE 

[Captioner] 20:16:40
LOOKING AT EACH OTHER ACROSS A DANCE FLOOR TRYING TO DECIDE WHEN OR WHETHER TO MAKE A MOVE BUT

[Captioner] 20:16:45
 EVENTUALLY SOMEBODY DOES MAKE A MOTION, WHICH AT THAT POINT THEY THINK MIGHT GET A MAJORITY BASED ON

[Captioner] 20:16:51
 WHAT THEY'VE BEEN HEARING FROM EVERYBODY ELSE.
I THINK THAT INITIAL PERIOD CAN BE

[Captioner] 20:16:56
 PRODUCTIVE WHEN THE COUNCIL IS SKILLFUL ENOUGH TO MANAGE THEIR WAY THROUGH IT AND NOT JUST

[Captioner] 20:17:00
 FIND THEMSELVES WANDERING AIMLESSLY AND HAVING A HARD TIME GETTING BACK ON TRACK.


[Captioner] 20:17:05
I THINK THIS COUNCIL HAS BEEN SKILLFUL IN MANAGING THAT.
I'VE SEEN ONLY A COUPLE OF

[Captioner] 20:17:09
 INSTANCES WHERE THEY SEEM TO BE WANDERING AND HAVING A HARD TIME GETTING BACK.


[Captioner] 20:17:17
ROSENBERG'S RULES OUT OF THE BOX PUT AN EMPHASIS ON SHORT-CIRCUITING THAT

[Captioner] 20:17:22
 GAZING ACROSS THE DANCE FLOOR STAGE AND TRYING TO GET QUICKLY TO A MOTION,

[Captioner] 20:17:27
 WHICH THEN BECOMES THE FOCAL POINT OF ALL FURTHER DISCUSSION.
THE ADVANTAGE OF ROSENBERG IS THAT

[Captioner] 20:17:32
 IT GETS YOU TO A VOTE QUICKLY, THE DISADVANTAGE OF ROSENBERG IS THAT IT GET TO YOU A VOTE

[Captioner] 20:17:37
 QUICKLY.
THERE'S THIS PREMIUM ON BEING THE FIRST TO PUSH THE

[Captioner] 20:17:43
 JEOPARDY BUZZER AND MAKE A MOTION, MAYBE, OR MAYBE A BETTER METAPHOR

[Captioner] 20:17:48
 WOULD BE GRAB THE STEERING WHEEL BECAUSE YOU EFFECTIVELY STEER THE FIRST FEW MINUTES OF CONVERSATION 

[Captioner] 20:17:53
AFTER THAT.
BUT FAILING THE

[Captioner] 20:17:58
 PROPOSAL, THE DEFAULT POSITION YOU FALL BACK TO IS TO VOTE ON WHATEVER THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION

[Captioner] 20:18:04
 WAS, WHICH HANDS A MUCH BIGGER ROLE TO STAFF.


[Captioner] 20:18:09
I THINK ROSENBERG'S RULES OUT OF THE BOX ARE BEST SUITED TO A BODY THAT

[Captioner] 20:18:14
 IS LESS SKILLED AT THIS BUT MAYBE HAS A HISTORY OF WANDERING A LOT AND WOULD LIKE A LITTLE MORE

[Captioner] 20:18:19
 GUIDANCE FROM STAFF OR ONE WHO SEES LEGISLATING AS KIND OF A CHORE TO GET THROUGH QUICKLY

[Captioner] 20:18:24
 AND GO HOME.
BUT MANY OF US WHO VOTE FOR MAYORS AND

[Captioner] 20:18:30
 COUNCILMEMBERS HOPED WE WERE VOTING FOR THE PEOPLE WHO WERE GOING TO CRAFT LEGISLATION AND CRAFT POLICY

[Captioner] 20:18:35
 AND NOT JUST VOTE UP OR DOWN ON A RECOMMENDATION HANDED TO THEM.


[Captioner] 20:18:40
SO I'M NOT SURE THAT THERE WAS SO MUCH OF A PROBLEM TO SOLVE

[Captioner] 20:18:45
 HERE.
THE GOOD NEWS IS EVEN IF YOU ADOPT THIS AS IS, YOU CAN STILL SORT OF 

[Captioner] 20:18:51
ENFORCE YOUR OWN DE FACTO RULES.
IF SOMEONE JUMPED THE GUN IN MAKING MOTIONS TOO

[Captioner] 20:18:56
 QUICKLY, THEN YOU CAN JUST VOTE NO QUICKLY AND RETURN TO THE PACE THAT YOU THINK IS MORE APPROPRIATE FOR THE

[Captioner] 20:19:01
 MATTER.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:19:07
>> Ms. Gauthier: THAT'S THE LAST SPEAKER.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:19:12
I'LL RETURN TO OUR COUNCIL CONVERSATION AND NEXT IS COUNCILMEMBER KENG.


[Captioner] 20:19:21
WE'RE DONE.
COUNCILMEMBER KENG.
>> Councilmember Keng: I JUST HAVE A 

[Captioner] 20:19:27
QUICK COMMENT ABOUT UNDER CHAPTER 1F, WHERE THE

[Captioner] 20:19:32
 SELECTION OF VICE MAYOR, SINCE WE'RE AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS CHART

[Captioner] 20:19:38
 AND THE 2022 ELECTION HAS TAKEN PLACE, MAYBE IT WOULD BE HELPFUL

[Captioner] 20:19:43
 TO UPDATE AND KIND OF PENCIL OUT

[Captioner] 20:19:48
 WHAT THE NEXT THREE TERMS WILL LOOK LIKE, THEN IT COULD BE MORE CLEAR TO EVERYBODY.


[Captioner] 20:19:56
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: THAT'S A FAIR OBSERVATION, AND IT CAN BE DONE ADMINISTRATIVELY OUTSIDE THE 

[Captioner] 20:20:01
HANDBOOK.
THIS IS FOR EXAMPLE PURPOSES, DEMONSTRATION PURPOSES, BUT I THINK 

[Captioner] 20:20:06
THAT'S A GOOD COMMENT THAT WE SHOULD REFLECT MOVING FORWARD.


[Captioner] 20:20:14
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
NEXT IS COUNCILMEMBER YANG SHAO.


[Captioner] 20:20:19
>> Councilmember Shao: THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR.
MY COMMENT IS REGARDING

[Captioner] 20:20:25
 THE REVISED VERSION OF WITHDRAWING A MOTION.
I

[Captioner] 20:20:30
 BELIEVE OUR PAST PRACTICE AND ALSO THE COMMON PRACTICE IS THAT WHENEVER

[Captioner] 20:20:36
 THE MOTION IS MODIFIED, THEN TYPICALLY THE PERSON WHO IS

[Captioner] 20:20:41
 SECONDING THE MOTION WILL BE ASKED TO AGREE TO THE

[Captioner] 20:20:47
 MODIFICATION.
TO ME, WITHDRAWING THE MOTION WOULD BE SIMILAR TO

[Captioner] 20:20:53
 THAT.
SO I

[Captioner] 20:20:59
 SUPPORT THE REVISED WHERE THE PERSON WHO SECONDS THE MOTION WOULD ALSO BE ASKED WHETHER

[Captioner] 20:21:04
 THAT PERSON WANTS TO WITHDRAW THE MOTION.
IF, LET'S SAY, HE AGREES WITH

[Captioner] 20:21:09
 THE ORIGINAL MOTION AND STILL WANTS TO MAKE THE MOTION BUT

[Captioner] 20:21:14
 MISS THE CHANCE TO MAKE THE MOTION IN THE FIRST PLACE, THEN

[Captioner] 20:21:20
 SINCE THERE'S A MOTION AND A SECOND, THEN IT'S UP TO THE VOTE.
THE

[Captioner] 20:21:25
 PERSON WHO CHANGES HIS MIND AND WANTS TO WITHDRAW THE MOTION

[Captioner] 20:21:30
 BUT FAILS BECAUSE THE PERSON WHO SECONDED DISAGREES WITH THE

[Captioner] 20:21:36
 WITHDRAWAL, CAN STILL VOTE NO BECAUSE HE ALREADY MAKES IT CLEAR THAT HE CHANGES HIS MIND

[Captioner] 20:21:41
 AND HE WANTS TO VOTE NO TO HIS ORIGINAL MOTION, SO IT

[Captioner] 20:21:46
 IS MUCH EASIER FOR PEOPLE TO FOLLOW WHEN TO VOTE, WHEN NOT TO VOTE,

[Captioner] 20:21:51
 BECAUSE IF THERE'S A FIRST AND A SECOND, THEN UNLESS THERE'S A

[Captioner] 20:21:57
 SUBSTITUTE OR A REVISED OR MODIFIED MOTION, THEN THE MOTION

[Captioner] 20:22:02
 AND THE SECOND SHOULD BE HONORED REGARDLESS.


[Captioner] 20:22:10
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: THE CURRENT COUNCIL RULE MAY BE ONE WE DO NOT

[Captioner] 20:22:15
 PRACTICE, BUT IT IS WITHIN THE HANDBOOK THAT IT WITHDRAWAL OF THE MOTION ONLY

[Captioner] 20:22:20
 OCCURS IF THE PERSON THAT SECONDS IT CONSENTS TO THE WITHDRAWAL.
SO THAT'S ACTUALLY

[Captioner] 20:22:26
 IF YOUR EXISTING RULE AND I MAINTAINED IT IN THE REVISED VERSION SO UNLESS THE COUNCIL DIRECTS

[Captioner] 20:22:29
 OTHERWISE THIS EVENING, THAT WILL CONTINUE TO BE THE RULE.
YOU COULD CHANGE THAT, BUT FOR NOW, 

[Captioner] 20:22:35
THE DEFAULT IN THIS RED LINE VERSION IS THAT EXISTING PRACTICE.


[Captioner] 20:22:42
DIFFERENT THAN ROSENBERG'S RULES.
ROSENBERG'S RULES DOES NOT REQUIRE THAT.


[Captioner] 20:22:46
>> Mayor Mei: WHAT I'VE HEARD, AT LEAST LISTENING TO SOME OF THE COUNCILMEMBERS WHO HAVE SPOKEN SO FAR, 

[Captioner] 20:22:51
IS THAT IT SEEMS LIKE THE DESIRE IS IF THE MAKER OF THE MOTION WANTS TO

[Captioner] 20:22:56
 WITHDRAW, WE WOULDN'T REQUIRE THE SECOND PERSON TO ALSO WITHDRAW,

[Captioner] 20:23:01
 THE SECONDER OF THE MOTION.
NEXT IS COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL AGAIN?


[Captioner] 20:23:06
I DON'T SEE YOUR NAME IF THE OTHER COUNCILMEMBERS ARE SPEAKING.


[Captioner] 20:23:14
COUNCILMEMBER COX, NOW I SEE YOUR NAME.


[Captioner] 20:23:20
>> Vice Mayor Cox: THANK YOU.
I THINK PART OF WHEN WE'RE MAKING MOTIONS, I THINK THE

[Captioner] 20:23:25
 KEY PART IS EITHER WE'RE GOING TO AMEND THE MOTION IS WHAT IT SAYS IN THE HANDBOOK FOR

[Captioner] 20:23:30
 ROSENBERG, WHICH MEANS WE'RE CHANGING WHAT WE MADE A MOTION

[Captioner] 20:23:36
 ON, VERSUS USING THE WORDING OF SUBSTITUTE THE MOTION.
AND SO

[Captioner] 20:23:41
 KIND OF TRIGGERING THAT IF YOU DO A SUBSTITUTE, YOU'RE REPLACING THE WHOLE TYPE OF

[Captioner] 20:23:47
 MOTION.
SO JUST MAKING SURE WE'RE CLEAR ON THAT TERMINOLOGY

[Captioner] 20:23:52
 AS WE ARE IN OUR MEETINGS, AND I THINK THAT THAT WILL HELP US IN TERMS OF IF WE

[Captioner] 20:23:58
 END UP AMENDING, THAT MEANS WE'RE CHANGING THE ORIGINAL, WHOEVER'S MAKING THE ORIGINAL MOTION, IF THEY

[Captioner] 20:24:03
 COME BACK AND MAKE AN AMENDMENT, THEN WE KNOW THAT THERE'S SOME CHANGES TO THAT MOTION BUT IT'S NOT

[Captioner] 20:24:08
 TAKING IT TOTALLY OUT UNLESS THE ORIGINAL MAKER OF

[Captioner] 20:24:15
 THE MOTION DECIDES TO WITHDRAW IT TOTALLY.
AND THIS TYPE OF UNDERSTANDING OF

[Captioner] 20:24:20
 ROSENBERG.
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: UNDER EXISTING RULES,

[Captioner] 20:24:25
 UNDER EXISTING COUNCIL RULES, THE PERSON WHO SECONDED THE MOTION WOULD HAVE TO AGREE

[Captioner] 20:24:30
 TO THE WITHDRAWAL.
UNDER ROSENBERG'S RULES, THE

[Captioner] 20:24:35
 MOVING PARTY CAN WITHDRAW IT ON HER OR HIS

[Captioner] 20:24:38
 OWN VOLITION.
NOT NEEDING THE CONSENT OF THE SECOND.


[Captioner] 20:24:45
EITHER IS ACCEPTABLE.
COUNCIL WILL HAVE TO DECIDE THAT.
I'M NOT HEARING A CLEAR

[Captioner] 20:24:51
 MESSAGE WHICH IS THE PREFERRED APPROACH.
I'VE HEARD FROM A FEW MEMBERS SO

[Captioner] 20:24:56
 FAR, AND IT'S NOT CLEAR TO ME SO WHEN COUNCIL FINISHES ITS DEBATE, THAT WOULD BE ONE QUESTION THAT WE WOULD

[Captioner] 20:25:01
 WANT TO RESOLVE, IS WHETHER YOU WANT TO KEEP YOUR EXISTING WITHDRAWAL MOTION PRACTICE OR WHETHER YOU WOULD 

[Captioner] 20:25:05
WANT TO MOVE TOWARDS ROSENBERG'S RULES.
>> Mayor Mei: COUNCILMEMBER --


[Captioner] 20:25:10
>> Vice Mayor Cox: I'M STILL GOING ON, OKAY?
I JUST HAD A QUESTION.


[Captioner] 20:25:15
I DID WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IF THE PERSON MAKES THE

[Captioner] 20:25:22
 MOTION, THAT IT CAN STILL BE DEBATED THAT IF YOU GO BACK AND HAVE TO CHANGE THE WORDING

[Captioner] 20:25:27
 OR SUBSTITUTE IT, AND THAT'S WHERE THE SECOND WOULD HAVE TO BE THE OTHER

[Captioner] 20:25:31
 PERSON WOULD NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT'S CLEAR WITH THEM.
I THINK WHEN WE DO MOTION, IT JUST 

[Captioner] 20:25:36
MAKING SURE WHAT ARE WE REALLY VOTING ON, AND I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT MAKES THIS MORE EFFICIENT, 

[Captioner] 20:25:42
IF WE MAKE SURE THAT BEING THE CHAIR AS THE MAYOR, THAT MAKING

[Captioner] 20:25:47
 SURE SHE RESTATES WHAT WE'RE VOTING ON OR THE MOTION TO MAKE SURE IT'S CLEAR, BECAUSE THERE'S A COUPLE THINGS THAT

[Captioner] 20:25:52
 HAVE HAPPENED OVER THE LAST YEAR THAT WE KIND OF WENT BACK THROUGH AND LOOKED AT THE MOTION AND

[Captioner] 20:25:57
 IT'S LIKE, WAIT A MINUTE, WE REALLY SAVED THIS

[Captioner] 20:26:03
 PART OR IT'S REALLY CLEAR.
SO MAKING SURE THERE'S A PART THAT -- IN RUNNING THE MEET,,

[Captioner] 20:26:08
 WE MAKE SURE THAT'S REALLY CLEAR AND ADDRESSED WHEN WE MAKE A MOTION, THAT WE KNOW WHAT WE'RE VOTING ON AND IF 

[Captioner] 20:26:13
THERE WAS ANY CONDITIONS OR SOMETHING OR WHOEVER WAS THE ORIGINAL PERSON MAKING THE MOTION BUT THEN THE CHAIR, 

[Captioner] 20:26:18
THE MAYOR WOULD THEN MAKE SURE WE HEARD WHAT THE FINAL WORDING OF THE MOTION

[Captioner] 20:26:23
 IS BEFORE WE VOTE.
I THINK THAT'S ANOTHER PART

[Captioner] 20:26:28
 TO IMPROVE OUR PROCESS AS WE HAVE OUR MEETINGS.
JUST SO THAT PART IS CLEAR,

[Captioner] 20:26:33
 AND THEN EVERYBODY WILL BE ABLE TO VOTE.
I THINK

[Captioner] 20:26:38
 LOGICALLY FOR RUNNING THE MEETING, IF WE ALLOW FOR DISCUSSION AND CALL FOR THE TECHNICAL QUESTIONS

[Captioner] 20:26:43
 AND CLARIFICATIONS, THAT'S GREAT.
GET IT ALL OUT OF THE WAY AND SAY WE'RE ENDING

[Captioner] 20:26:48
 THE TECHNICAL QUESTIONS NOW, ARE WE READY FOR A VOTE, AND THEN KIND OF TESTING THE

[Captioner] 20:26:53
 WATERS THERE IN THAT PART TO SEE IF THAT WOULD BE CLEAR, SO WE KIND OF END ONE PART,

[Captioner] 20:26:59
 START THE NEXT PART OF THE MEETING, AND WE'RE MOVING FORWARD AS OPPOSED TO IF WE START SOME DISCUSSION, WE

[Captioner] 20:27:03
 GO BACK AND SAY OH, WAIT A MINUTE, I WANT TO DISCUSS SOMETHING ELSE AND WE HAVE A MOTION ON THE FLOOR, THAT KIND 

[Captioner] 20:27:08
OF GETS US ALL OUT OF, I GUESS, SYNC OF HEARING THE IDEAS, HEARING WHAT THE MOTION IS, AND

[Captioner] 20:27:13
 SO IF WE KIND OF HAD SOME WAY THAT ALL OF US CAN KIND OF AGREE THAT IF WE DO A DISCUSSION OR

[Captioner] 20:27:19
 A TECHNICAL CLARIFICATION, YOU KNOW, AND ALSO INCLUDING AS PART OF THAT DISCUSSION WOULD ALSO BE HAVING

[Captioner] 20:27:25
 THE PUBLIC COMMENTS, BUT JUST ALLOWING US THAT WE'RE CLEAR ON OKAY, WE'RE DONE WITH THE

[Captioner] 20:27:30
 DISCUSSION, AND MAKING THAT CLEAR FROM THE CHAIR RUNNING THE MEETING, AND THEN NOW WE'RE READY TO MAKE A 

[Captioner] 20:27:35
MOTION.
I THINK THOSE ARE SOME THINGS THAT COULD BE SOME ADDED IMPROVEMENTS TO 

[Captioner] 20:27:40
HELP US BE MORE EFFICIENT, AND THEN REINSTATING WHAT THE MOTION IS.
THAT

[Captioner] 20:27:45
 WE'RE ALL VOTING ON.
SO WE MAKE SURE WE HEARD IT, BECAUSE I KNOW

[Captioner] 20:27:51
 SOMETIMES IF COUNCILWOMAN CAMPBELL SPEAKS AT THE END, SOMETIMES I MAY NOT HEAR THE WHOLE

[Captioner] 20:27:56
 PART, BUT JUST MAKING SURE COLLECTIVELY AS A GROUP THAT WE HEARD

[Captioner] 20:28:01
 EVERYTHING THAT'S STATED PRIOR TO THE VOTE, SO WE HEARD EVERYBODY'S -- YOU'VE BEEN HEARD FROM

[Captioner] 20:28:06
 THE OTHER COUNCILMEMBERS.
AND THEN THE VOTE CARRIES AND THEN AS OUR CITY CLERK ALWAYS

[Captioner] 20:28:11
 KIND OF SAYS THAT, YOU KNOW, SHOWS THE

[Captioner] 20:28:16
 PICTURE OF THE VOTING, THEN WE KNOW WHAT HAPPENED SO WE'RE LUCKY TO BE ELECTRONIC AND NOT HAVING TO DO IT BY 

[Captioner] 20:28:22
RAISING OF HANDS.
AS OTHER PLACES STILL DO THAT.
BUT

[Captioner] 20:28:27
 I JUST THOUGHT I'D ADD A COUPLE OF COMMENTS THERE THAT HOPEFULLY ARE HELPFUL FOR US

[Captioner] 20:28:32
 BEING MORE EFFICIENT AT OUR MEETINGS.
>> Mayor Mei: WELL, I THINK THAT DEFINITELY I

[Captioner] 20:28:37
 AGREE, I THINK IT'S BEEN SOME TIMES THAT PEOPLE JUMP AND WE HAVEN'T FINISHED AND THAT'S WHY IT'S IMPORTANT

[Captioner] 20:28:42
 FOR THE CHAIR TO BE ABLE TO LOOK AT THE LIST AND QUEUE TO ENSURE IF WE

[Captioner] 20:28:47
 ARE AGREEING OF HAVING THE OPTION TO DEBATE THAT WE WAIT FOR THE CHAIR TO ASK FOR A CALL FOR MOTION RATHER THAN 

[Captioner] 20:28:52
I THINK SOME PEOPLE JUMP IN RIGHT NOW AND MAKE THE MOTION BEFORE PEOPLE HAD A CHANCE TO SPEAK BECAUSE I SEE THE 

[Captioner] 20:28:57
QUEUE THAT'S THERE.
>> Vice Mayor Cox: WE'LL HELP YOU IF

[Captioner] 20:29:02
 WE'RE STILL ANSWERING QUESTIONS BECAUSE I KNOW YOU CAN'T READ

[Captioner] 20:29:08
 OUR MINDS.
>> Mayor Mei: ALSO ANY TIME IF SOMEBODY FEELS THEY'RE UNCLEAR

[Captioner] 20:29:13
 ABOUT A MOTION, THEY ARE ALWAYS WELCOME TO ASK FOR A CLARIFICATION OF THE VOTE.


[Captioner] 20:29:19
OR THE ITEM WHICH THEY'RE VOTING ON OR THE RESOLUTION OR THE POSITIONING.
FLO

[Captioner] 20:29:25
 URBAN WE HAVE A COUPLE COUNCILMEMBERS THAT ARE IN QUEUE STILL AGAIN, BUT --

[Captioner] 20:29:29
 COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL, I THINK YOU PRESSED.
>> Councilmember Campbell: JUST REALLY 

[Captioner] 20:29:33
QUICKLY.
I WAS A LITTLE CONFUSED WITH COUNCILMEMBER COX BECAUSE MY 

[Captioner] 20:29:39
UNDERSTANDING IS WE HAVE THREE BASIC TYPES OF MOTIONS.
A BASIC MOTION TO ACCEPT

[Captioner] 20:29:45
 STAFF RECOMMENDATION, AND THEN WE HAVE A MOTION TO AMEND, AND THEY WE HAVE A MOTION

[Captioner] 20:29:50
 TO SUBSTITUTE.
AND FROM WHAT THIS ROSENBERG SAYS

[Captioner] 20:29:56
 IS THAT A MOTION TO AMEND SEEKS TO RETAIN THE BASIC MOTION ON THE FLOOR BUT

[Captioner] 20:30:02
 MODIFY IT IN SOME WAY.
A SUBSTITUTE MOTION

[Captioner] 20:30:07
 SEEKS TO THROW OUT THE BASIC MOTION ON THE FLOOR AND SUBSTITUTE A NEW AND

[Captioner] 20:30:12
 DIFFERENT MOTION FOR IT.
THOSE ARE THE THREE BASICS.
AND THEN

[Captioner] 20:30:18
 HOW WE SECOND IT, HANDLE THE SECOND, IS WHAT

[Captioner] 20:30:23
 THE FUZZY PART IS FOR THAT.
SO IF, FOR EXAMPLE, I SAY I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A MOTION

[Captioner] 20:30:30
 TO AMEND STAFF RECOMMENDATION AND

[Captioner] 20:30:36
 ADD SIX CARROTS INSTEAD OF FIVE

[Captioner] 20:30:41
 AND THE FIRST MOTION HAS ALREADY BEEN SECONDED, DO I NEED THE APPROVAL OF THE

[Captioner] 20:30:46
 SECONDER TO -- IF THAT'S A WORD, TO ADD

[Captioner] 20:30:52
 THE SIX CARROTS?


[Captioner] 20:30:57
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: IF YOU MOVE TO AMEND, YOU NEED A SECOND FOR THAT AMENDMENT TO BELIEVE

[Captioner] 20:31:02
 EFFECTIVE.
WE DO HAVE A PRACTICE WHERE IT AN INFORMAL PRACTICE,

[Captioner] 20:31:08
 IT'S COMMON, ALTHOUGH UNDER FORMAL ROBERT'S RULES, IT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE AS

[Captioner] 20:31:13
 A PRACTICE, WE ALLOW FRIENDLY AMENDMENTS.
MEANING WE ALLOW A

[Captioner] 20:31:18
 PERSON TO ASK THE MOVING PARTY IF THEY WILL ACCEPT AN AMENDMENT, AND THAT SUFFICES.


[Captioner] 20:31:24
IF THEY NOD YES, THEN IT BECOMES THE MOTION ON THE FLOOR.
FROM A TECHNICAL PERSPECTIVE,

[Captioner] 20:31:29
 YOU ACTUALLY NEED TO MOVE THE AMENDMENT AND YOU NEED A SECOND TO THE AMENDMENT

[Captioner] 20:31:33
 FOR TO ACTUALLY BE EFFECTIVE AND YOU NEED TO VOTE.
UNDER TECHNICAL TERMS.


[Captioner] 20:31:37
>> Councilmember Campbell: OKAY.
BUT YOU'RE AMENDING SOMETHING THAT IS ALREADY ON THE FLOOR.


[Captioner] 20:31:42
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: CORRECT, YOU'RE NOT SUBSTITUTING IT.
>> Councilmember Campbell: SO I'M 

[Captioner] 20:31:45
STILL A LITTLE FUZZY ON THAT, I'M SORRY.
BECAUSE IF THE MOTION IS ALREADY ON 

[Captioner] 20:31:51
THE FLOOR AND IT HAS BEEN SECONDED, AND I SAY -- I'M THE THIRD PERSON NOW, SAY I WOULD

[Captioner] 20:31:57
 LIKE TO AMEND THE MOTION, CAN I DO THAT?
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: ANOTHER

[Captioner] 20:32:02
 AMENDMENT TO THE AMENDED MOTION?
>> Councilmember Campbell: NO, NO, NO, NO, AN AMENDMENT TO

[Captioner] 20:32:06
 THE BASIC MOTION.
SO YOU MADE A BASIC MOTION, THAT'S THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN AMEND A MOTION 

[Captioner] 20:32:12
BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE A BASIC MOTION, YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE A STARTING PLACE TO MAKE AN

[Captioner] 20:32:16
 AMENDMENT.
SO YOU'VE GOT A BASIC MOTION, SO THE FIRST PERSON MADE THE MOTION, SECOND 

[Captioner] 20:32:20
PERSON SECONDED.
I CAME IN, I'M THE THIRD PERSON WHO WANTS TO AMEND THAT BASIC MOTION.


[Captioner] 20:32:27
DO I NEED TO GET THE FIRST PERSON WHO MADE THE BASIC MOTION TO AGREE

[Captioner] 20:32:32
 WITH THE AMENDMENT, OR I CAN GET A FOURTH PERSON TO JUST SECOND IT.


[Captioner] 20:32:39
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: UNDER THE MOST STRICT VERSION OF THE RULE, IF YOU'RE ACTUALLY FOLLOWING ROBERT'S OR 

[Captioner] 20:32:44
ROSENBERG'S RULES, YOU ACTUALLY NEED SOMEONE TO VOTE.
FRIENDLY AMENDMENTS ARE NOT 

[Captioner] 20:32:46
ACCEPTABLE.
>> Councilmember Campbell: I SEE.
OKAY.


[Captioner] 20:32:51
AND THE SAME APPLIES WITH THE SUBSTITUTE MOTION.
WHEN YOU WANT TO THROW OUT WHAT 

[Captioner] 20:32:56
SOMEBODY -- THE BASIC MOTION OR THE AMENDED MOTION.


[Captioner] 20:33:00
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: A SUBSTITUTE MOTION, WE HAVE A PRACTICE THAT IT'S ALWAYS BEEN FORMAL, SO ANY TIME IT 

[Captioner] 20:33:06
BEEN EMPLOYED HERE IN FREMONT, MY OBSERVATION IS THAT A MOVING PARTY HAS MOVED TO SUBSTITUTE

[Captioner] 20:33:11
 A MOTION.
THERE'S BEEN A SECOND, AND IF THERE'S A MAJORITY VOTE ON THE SUBSTITUTE

[Captioner] 20:33:16
 MOTION, YOU DO AWAY WITH THE ORIGINAL MOTION ON THE FLOOR AND THE SUBSTITUTED MOTION THEN BECOMES THE 

[Captioner] 20:33:21
ONE THAT WAS MOVED FORWARD.
>> Councilmember Campbell: I KNOW, I HEAR THAT, BUT I DON'T GET IT

[Captioner] 20:33:26
 IN PROCESS.
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S THREE PEOPLE OR ONE PERSON OR TWO PEOPLE

[Captioner] 20:33:32
 WHO ARE DOING THIS.
YOU START WITH YOUR BASIC MOTION AND THEN YOU HAVE TO SUBSTITUTE IT OR 

[Captioner] 20:33:38
AMEND IT.
SO MY QUESTION IS, YOU START WITH YOUR BASIC MOTION, DO YOU HAVE TO HAVE

[Captioner] 20:33:41
 A SECOND FOR THAT BASIC MOTION?
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: YES.
>> Councilmember Campbell: OKAY.


[Captioner] 20:33:45
BUT THEN THE THIRD PERSON COMES IN AND SAYS OH, I WANT TO AMEND IT OR SUBSTITUTE IT.


[Captioner] 20:33:51
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: YOU WOULD HAVE TO SAY AMEND OR SUBSTITUTE BECAUSE THEY'RE DISTINCT MOTIONS

[Captioner] 20:33:57
 WITH DISTINCT PROCEDURES.
BUT A PERSON COULD ATTEMPT TO AMEND A

[Captioner] 20:34:02
 MOTION, AN ORIGINAL MOTION THAT'S ON THE FLOOR, AND IT COULD BE SUCCESSFUL IF YOU HAVE A SECOND

[Captioner] 20:34:05
 TO THAT MOTION AND THEN A MAJORITY VOTE.
>> Councilmember Campbell: OKAY.


[Captioner] 20:34:11
OKAY.


[Captioner] 20:34:15
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: THEN THE ORIGINAL MOTION WOULD BE AMENDED.
THE DIFFERENCE -- IF SOMEONE MOVES TO 

[Captioner] 20:34:21
SUBSTITUTE A MOTION AND YOU HAVE A SECOND AND THEN YOU HAVE A MAJORITY VOTE ON THAT, THE ORIGINAL MOTION

[Captioner] 20:34:25
 COULD HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FROM THE SUBSTITUTE MOTION AND THE SUBSTITUTE MOTION TAKES PRECEDENT.


[Captioner] 20:34:30
IT NOT AN AMENDED VERSION OF THE ORIGINAL MOTION.
IT'S A WHOLE MOTION COMPLETELY 

[Captioner] 20:34:32
DISTINCT FROM THE ORIGINAL.
>> Councilmember Campbell: NO, I GET THAT.


[Captioner] 20:34:37
I REALLY UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ALL THREE.
BUT WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND IS

[Captioner] 20:34:43
 THE PROCESS OR THE STEPS.
THAT'S WHAT'S A LITTLE CONFUSING TO ME, BECAUSE I DON'T

[Captioner] 20:34:48
 KNOW IF YOU DEFINITELY NEED TO HAVE A SECOND, IF YOU MAKE A BASIC MOTION, IF I

[Captioner] 20:34:54
 SAY -- I MAKE A MOTION TO EAT

[Captioner] 20:35:00
 SIX CARROTS TODAY AND NOBODY SECONDS IT, BUT SOMEBODY SAYS I WANT TO SUBSTITUTE IT AND MAKE IT 10

[Captioner] 20:35:03
 CARROTS.
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: ONE THING THAT MIGHT BE HELPFUL HERE IS TO 

[Captioner] 20:35:07
DISCUSS ORDER OF PRECEDENT.
>> Councilmember Campbell: THAT'S WHAT I DON'T GET.


[Captioner] 20:35:11
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: IF THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE GETTING AT.
IF YOU LOOK AT THE CHART THAT'S PART 

[Captioner] 20:35:15
OF YOUR PACKET, THE MOTIONS ARE DESCRIBED IN ACTUAL ORDER OF PRECEDENT.


[Captioner] 20:35:22
SO THAT'S WHY THEY'RE THE SAME, BOTH UNDER FREMONT CITY COUNCIL HANDBOOK

[Captioner] 20:35:26
 RULES AND UNDER ROSENBERG'S RULES BECAUSE THEY ACTUALLY HAVE THE SAME ORDER OF PRECEDENT.


[Captioner] 20:35:31
SO FOR EXAMPLE, A MOTION TO ADJOURN TAKES PRECEDENT OVER A MOTION TO AMEND.


[Captioner] 20:35:36
WHICH IS WAY FARTHER DOWN IN THE CHART.
SO IT'S ORDER OF PRIORITY.


[Captioner] 20:35:42
SO FOR EXAMPLE, IN YOUR HYPOTHETICAL WHERE YOU'RE DISCUSSING A SUBSTITUTE MOTION AND A

[Captioner] 20:35:47
 MOTION TO AMEND, YOU CAN SEE THAT THE SUBSTITUTE MOTION SITS ABOVE THE MOTION TO AMEND BECAUSE

[Captioner] 20:35:52
 ANY TIME IT'S ON THE FLOOR, IT TAKES PRECEDENT OVER THE MOTION TO AMEND.
SO THAT IS YOUR

[Captioner] 20:35:57
 PROCEDURE.
>> Councilmember Campbell: OKAY.


[Captioner] 20:36:03
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: IF YOU'RE WONDERING HOW TO PRESENT IT, THIS CHART ALSO TELLS YOU, DO YOU NEED A 

[Captioner] 20:36:08
MOTION ON THAT SECOND?
IS THAT MOTION DEBATABLE?
IS

[Captioner] 20:36:14
 THAT MOTION AMENABLE,

[Captioner] 20:36:18
 AND WHAT -- SO BASICALLY YOU'D WALK DOWN THE LINE AND YOU'D GO TO THE RIGHT ON ANY MOTION TO SEE HOW IT'S 

[Captioner] 20:36:21
DONE.
I THINK THAT'S WHAT YOU MAY BE REFERRING TO.


[Captioner] 20:36:26
>> Councilmember Campbell: GOT IT.


[Captioner] 20:36:31
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
NEXT IS COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN.
>> Councilmember Salwan: THANK YOU, 

[Captioner] 20:36:37
MADAME MAYOR.
I DON'T WANT TO BELABOR THIS POINT AND KIND OF GET

[Captioner] 20:36:40
 THIS WRAPPED UP BUT I GUESS THIS IS IMPORTANT.
SO AT LEAST IN THE TIME I'VE BEEN ON 

[Captioner] 20:36:46
PLANNING COMMISSION AND CITY COUNCIL, WE'VE ALLOWED PEOPLE TO WITHDRAW A MOTION JUST BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE DON'T 

[Captioner] 20:36:50
WANT TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH THAT MOTION THAT THEY MADE.
OR THEY WANT TO MOVE ON.


[Captioner] 20:36:55
SO I THINK I PERSONALLY LIKE THE IDEA IF SOMEBODY

[Captioner] 20:37:00
 DOESN'T -- IF ONE OF US WITHDRAWS A MOTION, THEY CAN, AND THE SECONDER OF THE MOTION CAN MAKE THAT MOTION

[Captioner] 20:37:03
 AGAIN, SAY I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE THAT MOTION.
AND THEN SOMEBODY ELSE CAN SECOND IT 

[Captioner] 20:37:09
AND THEN YOU CAN VOTE ON IT.
THAT'S AT LEAST BEEN THE PRESS DEBT.
I KNOW

[Captioner] 20:37:14
 IN PRACTICE, THAT'S WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING BUT IN THE HANDBOOK, I GUESS NOBODY'S FOLLOWING

[Captioner] 20:37:20
 IT.
AND AS FAR AS I THINK THE DISCUSSION THAT YOU

[Captioner] 20:37:26
 HAD, COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL, SO BASICALLY IF YOU WANT TO -- IF THE THIRD PERSON WANTS TO AMEND THE FIRST

[Captioner] 20:37:30
 MOTION, IT UP TO THE MAKER OF THE MOTION TO SAY YES, I ACCEPT IT, OR I REJECT IT.


[Captioner] 20:37:36
IF THE THIRD PERSON WANTS TO MAKE A MOTION, THEN THAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED A

[Captioner] 20:37:40
 SUBSTITUTE MOTION, THEN THEY WOULD NEED A SECOND AND THAT WOULD TAKE PRIORITY OVER THE ORIGINAL MOTION.


[Captioner] 20:37:49
AND SO THAT'S KIND OF -- I JUST WANTED TO THROW THAT IN THERE AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN GET THIS

[Captioner] 20:37:54
 WRAPPED UP AT SOME POINT.
THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:37:59
SOUNDS LIKE A MOTION TO ACCEPT.
OKAY.
COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL, YOU ARE AGAIN 

[Captioner] 20:38:04
ON THE LIST?
OKAY.
COUNCILMEMBER SHAO AND THEN I'D LIKE 

[Captioner] 20:38:09
TO CALL THE VOTE.
>> Councilmember Shao: ACTUALLY I WOULD JUST LIKE TO MAKE

[Captioner] 20:38:14
 A COMMENT.
AND I'VE BEEN ENJOYING OUR PRACTICE OF SEPARATING THE QUESTIONS

[Captioner] 20:38:20
 FROM COMMENTS, AND THEN TYPICALLY THE AGENDA MAY BE

[Captioner] 20:38:25
 INTRODUCED BY THE STAFF, AND THEN THE QUESTIONS RAISED BY THE

[Captioner] 20:38:30
 CITY COUNCILMEMBERS WILL BE ENTERTAINED, AND

[Captioner] 20:38:35
 THEN IT WILL BE PUBLIC SPEAKERS, AND THEN AFTER THAT, THE FLOOR IS GIVEN BACK TO THE CITY

[Captioner] 20:38:41
 COUNCILMEMBERS FOR COMMENTS, OR DEBATES.
AND WHEN ALL THE

[Captioner] 20:38:46
 DEBATES EXHAUST, THEN THE MAYOR OR THE PERSON WHO CHAIRS THE MEETING WOULD SAY

[Captioner] 20:38:52
 MAY I ENTERTAIN A MOTION.
AND THEN MAY I HAVE A SECOND.
SO TO

[Captioner] 20:38:57
 ME, THAT ORDER IS REALLY MAKING THE WHOLE RECORD VERY

[Captioner] 20:39:02
 CLEAR.
AFTER ALL, WHO MAKES THE MOTION, WHO SECONDED IT, DOESN'T MEAN

[Captioner] 20:39:07
 ANYTHING.
IT'S NOT LIKE WHEN WE ARE

[Captioner] 20:39:13
 SHOTGUNNING OUR SEATS, O I GET THIS SEAT, I GET -- I GET TO MAKE THE MOTION, SO,

[Captioner] 20:39:18
 YOU KNOW, SINCE I MADE THE MOTION SO POLITICALLY I CAN BRAG LIKE, OH, LOOK, IN THE HISTORY OF

[Captioner] 20:39:24
 FREMONT, I AM THE PERSON WHO MAKES THIS MOTION ON

[Captioner] 20:39:29
 THIS HISTORIC AGENDA ITEM, NO, IT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING.
SO I BELIEVE, YOU

[Captioner] 20:39:34
 KNOW, IN ORDER TO FOLLOW THE ORDER, LET'S JUST GIVE EVERYBODY

[Captioner] 20:39:40
 THE CHANCE TO DEBATE.
WHEN EVERYBODY

[Captioner] 20:39:45
 IS RUNNING OUT OF THINGS TO SAY, THEN IT'S A SIGN THAT EVERYONE IS READY.
OTHERWISE THEN YOU MAKE

[Captioner] 20:39:50
 A MOTION AND MAYBE THE MOTION DOESN'T HAVE ANYONE TO SECOND, OR EVEN

[Captioner] 20:39:56
 SECONDED AND THEN COMES WITH THE AMENDED MOTION, SUBSTITUTE MOTION,

[Captioner] 20:40:01
 I THINK IT'S A WASTE OF TIME.
SO I BELIEVE,

[Captioner] 20:40:07
 YOU KNOW, IN THE PAST, OUR PAST PRACTICE IS VERY USEFUL.
THAT'S ALL I WANTED TO COMMENT.


[Captioner] 20:40:10
>> Mayor Mei: SO SPEAKING OF WHICH, I WAS GOING TO SAY, I APPRECIATE THE COMMENT.


[Captioner] 20:40:16
I THINK IT IS SOMETIMES -- ONE OF THE SPEAKERS MENTIONED IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S

[Captioner] 20:40:21
 NOT A SHOT CLOCK AND WE HAVE A DEADLINE AS TO WHO'S THE FIRST TO MAKE THE MOTION, BECAUSE HONESTLY ANYTHING 

[Captioner] 20:40:26
THAT HAPPENS ON THIS COUNCIL, IT REQUIRES THE MAJORITY, SO I THANK ALL OF YOU IN TERMS OF COLLECTIVELY MAKING

[Captioner] 20:40:31
 THOSE DECISIONS IN TERMS OF ACCEPTING OR REJECTING.
AND SPEAKING OF WHICH, I'D LIKE TO 

[Captioner] 20:40:36
CALL THE MOTION.
SO IF SOMEBODY WOULD MAKE THE MOTION, PLEASE, TO ADOPT THE

[Captioner] 20:40:38
 RESOLUTION OR TO NOT ADOPT.
>> Councilmember Campbell: MOTION TO ACCEPT.


[Captioner] 20:40:49
>> Mayor Mei: MOTION BY COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL AND SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER SHAO TO ADOPT A

[Captioner] 20:40:54
 RESOLUTION AMENDING THE CITY COUNCIL HANDBOOK RULES OF ORDER --
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: THROUGH

[Captioner] 20:40:59
 THE MAYOR, IF I MAY, I JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT THAT MOTION WILL INCLUDE A

[Captioner] 20:41:04
 FEW CHANGES TO ROSENBERG'S RULES OF ORDER.
NUMBER ONE, IT'S THE ONE THAT

[Captioner] 20:41:09
 COUNCILMEMBER SHAO JUST REFLECTED WHICH IS THAT COUNCIL WILL ENGAGE IN DISCUSSION

[Captioner] 20:41:14
 BEFORE A MOTION HITS THE FLOOR, THAT'S YOUR CURRENT PRACTICE, WE'RE KEEPING THAT IN THE HANDBOOK.


[Captioner] 20:41:19
THE SECOND IS THAT AS WRITTEN, THE HAND BOOK RETAINS YOUR RULE THAT

[Captioner] 20:41:24
 A MOTION WITHDRAWAL REQUIRES THE SECOND PERSON -- THE

[Captioner] 20:41:29
 SECONDING PARTY TO CONSENT TO THE WITHDRAWAL BEFORE THAT HAPPENS.
>> Mayor Mei: IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT, 

[Captioner] 20:41:35
COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL?
SO THAT THE MOTION MAKER

[Captioner] 20:41:38
 CANNOT WITHDRAW WITHOUT THE SECOND, DO YOU WANT THAT?
I THOUGHT THAT WAS ONE OF THE THINGS 

[Captioner] 20:41:42
THAT YOU WANTED TO CHANGE, SO THAT MAKER OF THE MOTION COULD WITHDRAW IT ON THEIR OWN.


[Captioner] 20:41:48
>> Councilmember Campbell: BUT ISN'T THAT ROSENBERG, THE MAKER OF

[Captioner] 20:41:53
 THE MOTION CAN WITHDRAW IT ON THEIR OWN WITH CONSENT OF

[Captioner] 20:41:58
 THE SECOND?
YOUR MIC.
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: YES, THAT IS 

[Captioner] 20:42:03
ROSENBERG'S RULES.
IN THE RED LINE VERSION, I MAINTAINED THE CURRENT HANDBOOK LANGUAGE THAT 

[Captioner] 20:42:09
REQUIRES A SECONDING PARTY TO CONSENT TO THE WITHDRAWAL.
SO IF YOU WERE TO

[Captioner] 20:42:14
 DESIRE FOR ROSENBERG'S RULES TO APPLY THEN ONLY THE MOVING PARTY HAS TO

[Captioner] 20:42:17
 WITHDRAW, I'LL MAKE THAT ONE CHANGE.
>> Councilmember Campbell: YOU WANT THE ROSENBERG?


[Captioner] 20:42:23
OKAY, I'M HEARING NODS FROM THE COUNCIL, THEY WANT THE ROSENBERG.
SO LET'S -- VERSION OF IT,

[Captioner] 20:42:28
 YES.
AND I THINK THE OTHER CLARIFICATION IS ABOUT WHEN YOU NEED

[Captioner] 20:42:33
 TO SECOND.
I'M STILL A LITTLE CONFUSED BY THAT, BECAUSE ROSENBERG SAYS YOU DON'T 

[Captioner] 20:42:38
NECESSARILY HAVE TO DO IT.
IT RECOMMENDED AND IT SHOULD BE PROPER PROCEDURE TO DO IT

[Captioner] 20:42:44
 BEFORE YOU CONTINUE ON PROCEDURALLY OR CONTINUE ON WITH THE DISCUSSION, I WOULD

[Captioner] 20:42:49
 LIKE TO SEE IF THE COUNCIL IS OPEN TOP ALLOWING, IN

[Captioner] 20:42:54
 THIS -- IN MY MOTION, TO SAY WE NEED TO HAVE A SECOND BEFORE WE CAN MOVE ON, IF THERE'S A MOTION ON THE FLOOR.


[Captioner] 20:43:01
SO YOU CAN'T SHUT SOMEBODY DOWN.
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: THE WAY

[Captioner] 20:43:06
 THAT I'VE DRAFTED THE LANGUAGE INCLUDES,

[Captioner] 20:43:11
 REFLECTS CURRENT COUNCIL PRACTICE ON HOW DEBATE HAPPENS.
SO RIGHT

[Captioner] 20:43:15
 NOW ROSENBERG'S RULES LEAVES IT IN THE AIR.
YOU CAN HAVE A MOTION, THEN DEBATE.


[Captioner] 20:43:20
YOU CAN HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND, THEN DEBATE.
I INCORPORATED WHAT YOU CURRENTLY

[Captioner] 20:43:26
 DO, WHICH IS TO SAY YOU'RE ALLOWED TO HAVE DISCUSSION AND DEBATE BEFORE A MOTION HITS

[Captioner] 20:43:31
 THE FLOOR.
THAT WAY, IN THIS CIRCUMSTANCE, BY THE TIME THE MOTION HITS THE

[Captioner] 20:43:33
 FLOOR, YOU HAVE A SECOND AND THE VOTE.
>> Councilmember Campbell: OKAY, 

[Captioner] 20:43:38
COOL.
OKAY.
I LIKE THAT TOO, BECAUSE I DON'T LIKE 

[Captioner] 20:43:43
TO NECESSARILY RUSH TO MAKE A MOTION SO SOMEBODY CAN SECOND IT SO WE DON'T HAVE A CHANCE TO DISCUSS, BECAUSE IT'S 

[Captioner] 20:43:46
GOOD TO HEAR WHAT YOUR FELLOW COUNCILMEMBERS HAVE TO SAY ABOUT A PARTICULAR ISSUE.


[Captioner] 20:43:51
SO I REALLY LIKE THAT THAT WAY, AND I THINK THAT WAS COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN, YOU SAID THE SAME

[Captioner] 20:43:53
 THING.
OKAY.
>> Mayor Mei: AND I JUST WANT TO 

[Captioner] 20:43:58
CLARIFY THAT COUNCILMEMBER SHAO, SINCE YOU'RE SECONDING THIS, THAT YOU AGREED TO THIS?


[Captioner] 20:44:03
>> Councilmember Shao: I WAS GOING TO SAY THAT I WOULD AGREE WITH THE

[Captioner] 20:44:08
 CLARIFIED MOTION, AND I WILL STILL KEEP MY SECOND.
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY.


[Captioner] 20:44:12
I WAS GOING TO CALL A VOTE BUT THERE'S A REQUEST FROM COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN TO CLARIFY AGAIN.


[Captioner] 20:44:17
>> Councilmember Salwan: WELL, SINCE WE HAVE THE RULE THAT YOU CAN'T SPEAK AFTER THE MOTION, I THOUGHT I'LL JUST 

[Captioner] 20:44:22
SAY IT NOW.
SO IT UP TO THE MOTION MAKER TO BE CLEAR IN WHAT

[Captioner] 20:44:27
 THE MOTION IS.
AND IT'S UP TO EACH COUNCILMEMBER TO MAKE SURE THEY UNDERSTAND

[Captioner] 20:44:32
 THAT -- THEY UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY'RE VOTING ON.
IF AT ANY POINT ANY COUNCILMEMBER 

[Captioner] 20:44:36
FEELS LIKE THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT THE MOTION IS THEN THEY SHOULD ASK FOR THE CLARIFICATION PRIOR TO THE VOTE.


[Captioner] 20:44:41
I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THAT.
>> Councilmember Campbell: CORRECT.
SO

[Captioner] 20:44:46
 THE RECOMMENDATION THAT WE HAVE BEFORE US

[Captioner] 20:44:54
 FROM OUR LEGAL

[Captioner] 20:44:59
 COUNCIL IS TO ACCEPT THE ROSENBERG RULES AS THE PROCEDURAL RULE BY WHICH THE COUNCIL

[Captioner] 20:45:14
WE WOULD ALSO MAKE SURE I'M 
SAYING THIS RIGHT RAFAEL, 
MEMBERSHIP ME OUT

[Captioner] 20:45:16
.
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado:   SURE 
I CAN HELP.


[Captioner] 20:45:21
I UNDERSTAND THE MOTION TO BE 
THAT YOU'RE MOVING FORWARD 
STAFF'S RECOMMENDATION WITH

[Captioner] 20:45:25
 TWO 
OBSERVATIONS.
NUMBER 1, COUNCIL WILL NOW 


[Captioner] 20:45:30
CHANGE ITS PROCEDURE FOR 
WITHDRAWAL OF A MOTION TO ACCEPT 
A PROCESS WHERE THE MOVING PARTY

[Captioner] 20:45:36
 
CAN WITHDRAW A MOTION ON THAT 
PERSON'S OWN AND NUMBER TWO,

[Captioner] 20:45:40
 
ONCE PUBLIC COMMENT CONCLUDES ON 
AN ITEM, COUNCIL CAN HAVE 


[Captioner] 20:45:46
DISCUSSION AND DEBATE BEFORE A 
MOTION HITS THE FLOOR.

[Captioner] 20:46:02

>> Councilmember Campbell:   
YES, THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING OF 


[Captioner] 20:46:07
THE MOTION.
AND COUNCILMEMBER SHAO

[Captioner] 20:46:10
, YOU 
AGREE WITH THAT?
>> Councilmember Shao:   YES I 


[Captioner] 20:46:15
DO.
>> Mayor Mei:   I'M CALLING THE 
MOTION.


[Captioner] 20:46:21
THE MOTION CARRIES UNANIMOUSLY.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:46:27
NEXT I WAS GOING TO ASK FOR ANY 
REPORT ON COMMITTEE ASSIGNMENTS.


[Captioner] 20:46:35
COUNCILMEMBER SHAO IS THAT FOR 
COMMITTEE ASSIGNMENTS OR IS THAT 
JUST FROM BEFORE?


[Captioner] 20:46:37
>> Councilmember Shao:   FROM 
BEFORE.
>> Mayor Mei:   OKAY SO I KNOW 


[Captioner] 20:46:41
THAT WE ARE RETURNING TO 
IN-PERSON OR BACK TO OUR 
COMMITTEE MEETINGS.


[Captioner] 20:46:46
AND I JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT 
SOME OF US I THINK WILL BE GOING 
TO THE LEAGUE OF

[Captioner] 20:46:51
 CALIFORNIA 
CITIES AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN 
REPORT-OUT THERE THAT.

[Captioner] 20:46:55

AND OTHER THAN THAT, THANK YOU 
FOR ALL WHO ARE SERVING ON THE 


[Captioner] 20:47:00
COMMITTEES.
COUNCILMEMBER COX OR VICE MAYOR 
COX YOU JUST PUSHED.


[Captioner] 20:47:03
>> Vice Mayor Cox:   YES, I DID 
WANT TO MENTION TWO THINGS 
BEFORE WE CLOSE OUT.


[Captioner] 20:47:08
ONE IS I WANTED TO THANK OUR 
FREMONT FIRE DEPARTMENT FOR 
CONDUCTING THE DAY OF 


[Captioner] 20:47:14
REMEMBRANCE.
AND IN ADDITION, WITH OUR 
FREMONT FIRE, POLICE CHIEF

[Captioner] 20:47:19
 SEAN 
WASHINGTON AND OF COURSE OUR 
FIRE CHIEF SARI

[Captioner] 20:47:25
A DIAZ CONDUCTED 
IT WITH THE ENTIRE FREMONT FIRE 
DEPARTMENT.

[Captioner] 20:47:30

BUT IN CONJUNCTION WITH CAPTAIN 
NELSON WAS ALSO THERE.


[Captioner] 20:47:34
I JUST WANTED TO SAY I 
APPRECIATED, THERE WAS A LOT 
OF -- SOME ACTIVITY ON THE 


[Captioner] 20:47:40
STREET THERE THAT PEOPLE WERE 
VERY RECEPTIVE ON THE DAY OF 
REMEMBRANCE ON 9/11

[Captioner] 20:47:45
 THAT TOOK 
PLACE AT 6:45 A.M.
ANOTHER PART

[Captioner] 20:47:50
 THAT I DID WANT TO 
GIVE A SPECIAL SHOUT OUT AND 
THAT IS TO OUR VERY OWN DIRECTOR 


[Captioner] 20:47:55
OF HUMAN SERVICES, SUZANNE

[Captioner] 20:48:04
 SUE SUZANNE 
SHENFIL.
SHE WAS HONORED AT THE

[Captioner] 20:48:12
 MUSLIM  
COMMUNITY AND WAS PRESENT AT

[Captioner] 20:48:16
 THE 
AFGHAN, THANKING FOR ENTIRE CITY 
OF FREMONT TEAM FOR THEIR 


[Captioner] 20:48:21
EFFORTS, SO I JUST WANTED TO 
MENTION THAT.
>> Mayor Mei:   OKAY, WELL REAL 


[Captioner] 20:48:26
QUICKLY I WILL ALSO SHARE OUT, 
REAL QUICKLY, SERVING ON THE

[Captioner] 20:48:31
 
ALAMEDA COUNTY TRANSPORTATION 
COMMISSION, I HAD A PRESENT

[Captioner] 20:48:36
 
PRESENCE TO TALK ABOUT VISION 
ZERO AND HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY HOW 


[Captioner] 20:48:42
WE ARE HOLISTICALLY IMPLEMENTING 
THAT AS A CITY.
AND THEN AS PART OF ECONOMIC

[Captioner] 20:48:46
 
DEVELOPMENT AND BEING -- AS PART 
OF THE ALAMEDA COUNTY MAYORS I 


[Captioner] 20:48:51
DID HAVE A CHANCE YESTERDAY ALSO 
TO MEET WITH THE PRIME MINISTER 
OF VIETNAM.


[Captioner] 20:48:56
AND SO HE WAS TALKING ABOUT SOME 
TRADE OPPORTUNITIES.
AND I ALSO

[Captioner] 20:49:00
 LOOK FORWARD TO ALL 
OF US PARTICIPATING IN LIKE I 
SAID THE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA 


[Captioner] 20:49:04
CITIES.
AND I THINK HOPEFULLY WE'LL GET 
SOME FEEDBACK FROM THAT, THAT'S 


[Captioner] 20:49:10
PRODUCTIVE IN TERMS OF SHARING 
OF BEST PRACTICES.

[Captioner] 20:49:16

COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN.
>> Councilmember Kassan:   HI, 


[Captioner] 20:49:21

THAT WE LIKE TO TALK ABOUT AT 
THE END OF THE MEETING BUT I 


[Captioner] 20:49:37

DID DISCUSS THAT AND AGREED THAT

OF SILENCE AGAIN BECAUSE THERE 
HAVE BEEN UNFORTUNATELY

[Captioner] 20:49:54
 MORE 
TRAGEDIES THIS LAST COUPLE OF 
WEEKS AND IN PARTICULAR I WOULD 


[Captioner] 20:49:58
LIKE TO NOTE THAT WE HAVE LOST A 
MEMBER OF THE COMMUNITY SO I 
WANTED TO NOTE THAT.


[Captioner] 20:50:04
IT'S UNFORTUNATE, IT'S IN 
SEATTLE AND I THINK SOME OF YOU 
HAD A CHANCE, AN OPPORTUNITY

[Captioner] 20:50:08
 TO 
ATTEND THE VIGIL SO I'D JUST 
CAN.


[Captioner] 20:50:13
>> Trustee Sweeney:   THAT WE

COUPLE OF WEEKS

[Captioner] 20:50:23
.
THANK YOU.
AND SO I APPRECIATE ALL THE 


[Captioner] 20:50:29

STAFF IN PARTICULAR, AND FOCUS 
ON BEING ABLE TO DELIVER THE 


[Captioner] 20:50:33
RESOURCES AND PROGRAMS THAT WE 
NEED.
SO BLESSINGS TO ALL.
