>> MISSION PEAK IS THE TOP RATED 
19:11:55 VISITOR ATTRACTION IN FREMONT.
THE TOP DESTINATION FOR HEALTH AND FITNESS AND WELL-BEING IN THE CITY.

19:12:02 TOP RATED ON YELP, TOP RATED EVERYWHERE, AND DRAWS VISITORS FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD  ACTUALLY.

19:12:09 THE LAST LEASE AGREEMENT WITH THE PARK DISTRICT HAD NO COST, FREE LEASE, AND TERM OF 25  YEARS.

19:12:16 THE LEASE EXPIRED ON JULY 7TH, 2020.
THAT'S ALMOST EXACTLY ONE YEAR AGO TOMORROW.

19:12:27 AND ON DECEMBER 15TH, JUST SIX MONTHS AGO OR SEVEN MONTHS AGO, A COUNCILMEMBER ASKED I'D LIKE TO GET 
19:12:33 FEEDBACK FROM WHERE WE ARE WHAT THE CURRENT STATUS IS AND FOR COUNCIL TO GIVE BROAD POLICY GUIDELINES WHERE 
19:12:39 WE'D LIKE TO SEE THIS LEASE, WHAT IT COULD LOOK LIKE, THEN STAFF GOES BACK AND DOES THE SAUSAGE  MAKING, WE CAN'T 
19:12:44 BE INVOLVED IN DAY TO DAY NEGOTIATIONS BECAUSE THERE'S NO WAY WE'D KNOW ALL THE PARAMETERS BUT I THINK WE CAN GIVE 
19:12:49 GENERAL GUIDELINES, YOU KNOW, AND THAT, WE'D LIKE TO SEE, GET THE COUNCIL'S FEEDBACK, MORE DIRECTION, WE'D LIKE TO 
19:12:54 SEE THIS LEASE GO IN, DOES THAT MAKE SENSE, MADAME MAYOR?
I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A MOTION TO HAVE 
19:13:28 CITY COUNCIL BRING THIS BACK FOR AN AGENDA ITEM FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION.
AND THE CITY MANAGER STATED, STAFF 
19:13:32 UNDERSTANDS THE REFERRAL AND WE THINK IT'S DOABLE.
EXACT QUOTE.

19:13:42 AND THE MAYOR TOOK THE VOTE, HELD A ROLL CALL VOTE, SO THE REFERRAL PASSES UNANIMOUSLY AND THIS WILL BE BROUGHT 
19:13:52 BACK FOR A DISCUSSION ITEM FOR AN UPDATE ON THE CONTRACT AND ALSO THE TERMS, SO SINCE DECEMBER 15TH OF 2020, 
19:13:58 I'VE GOT A QUESTION.
DID THE COUNCIL EVER GIVE STAFF ANY BROAD POLICY GUIDANCE OR DIRECTION 
19:14:03 REGARDING THE  REFERRAL?
DID THE COUNCIL EVER HAVE AN AGENDIZED DISCUSSION?

19:14:09  DISCUSSION OF THE REFERRAL?
AND I'D LIKE TO BOIL DOWN THE QUESTION TO BE REAL SIMPLE.

19:14:17 IN OTHER WORDS, DID ANYTHING EVER COME OF THE REFERRAL WHICH PASSED UNANIMOUSLY?

19:14:28 THIS IS A GOOD TIME TO ASK.
IT'S THE NATIONAL PARKS AND RECREATION MONTH, AND IT'S BEEN ONE YEAR THAT THE 
19:14:37 -- SINCE THE LEASE EXPIRED.
THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:14:46 OKAY, AT THIS TIME, I SEE NO OTHER PUBLIC SPEAKERS FOR  NON-AGENDIZED ITEMS.

19:14:53 THE NEXT ITEM IS ITEM 5A, WHICH IS GOING TO BE HAVING ABILITY FOR US TO ASK QUESTIONS.

19:15:00 I DON'T THINK THERE'S A FORMAL PRESENTATION, AND I'D LIKE TO WELCOME FIRE MARSHAL JAY SWARDENSKI, AS HE'S 
19:15:08 GOING TO BE ABLE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS, FIRST I GUESS FOR THIS PUBLIC HEARING, SURCHARGE INCREASES.

19:15:19 I WOULD LIKE TO OPEN UP FOR QUESTIONS FROM THE  COUNCILMEMBERS.
SEEING NONE, ARE THERE ANY COMMENTS 
19:15:23 FROM THE -- COUNCILMEMBER KENG, DID YOU HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT THIS ITEM?
THANK YOU.

19:15:26 THEN PLEASE GO AHEAD AND ASK YOUR QUESTION.
>> Councilmember Keng: THANK  YOU.

19:15:34 SO I WAS WONDERING WHO ARE THE ENTITIES THAT ARE BEING ASSESSED THIS FEE CURRENTLY?

19:15:39 >> SURE.
THERE ARE CURRENTLY ABOUT 1100 REGULATED FACILITIES IN FREMONT.

19:15:44  UNDER EACH ONE OF THE SIX PROGRAMS THAT ARE CAPTURED BY THE CUPA PROGRAM IN GENERAL.

19:15:55 THEY RANGE FROM BODY SHOPS, MAINTENANCE SHOPS, GAS STATIONS, AND THE BULK OF THE LARGER ONES OBVIOUSLY ARE ADVANCED 
19:16:00 MANUFACTURING FACILITIES, PRIMARILY SOUTH OF AUTOMALL AND NORTH OF 84 UP IN THE ARDENWOOD AREA.

19:16:06 >> Councilmember Keng: THANK  YOU.
SO IT JUST A ONE-TIME FEE OR ANNUAL FEE?

19:16:16 >> IT AN ANNUAL FEE.
WE'VE BEEN ASSESSING IT SINCE THE CUPA PROGRAM WAS CREATED.

19:16:22 THERE'S THE NEXT GEN PROJECT TO UPDATE THE ELECTRONIC SYSTEM THAT WE USE TO REPORT  EVERYTHING, AND THEN THE OTHER 
19:16:31 ONE IS JUST A DEFICIT-RELATED FEE.

19:17:44 BECAUSE I LIVE IN THAT DISTRICT.
AND I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S ANYONE ELSE THAT NEEDS TO RECUSE THEMSELF.

19:17:50 I SEE COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN.
>> Councilmember Salwan: YES, I, TOO, WILL BE RECUSING ON THIS ITEM.

19:18:03 MY RESIDENCE IS WITHIN  DISTRICT 88.
>> Mayor Mei: WE'LL BE OFF TEMPORARILY.

19:18:13 >> Vice Mayor Shao: ALL RIGHT.

19:18:36 FROM THE COUNCIL  REGARDING THIS ITEM?
I SEE NONE.

19:18:45 HAS ANY QUESTION REGARDING THIS PUBLIC HEARING ITEM?
>> Ms. Gauthier: THERE ARE NONE.

19:18:51 >> Vice Mayor Shao: THERE ARE NONE.
AND THEN ARE THERE ANY COMMENTS ON THIS ITEM?

19:19:10 THIS IS AN ACTION ITEM, I BELIEVE, AND WE ARE GOING TO FOLLOW THE STAFF'S RECOMMENDATION TO FIRST OF ALL HAVE 
19:19:22 THIS PUBLIC HEARING  CONDUCTED TONIGHT, AND THEN TO ORDER RETURN ASSESSMENT BALLOTS TO BE TABULATED ON JULY 7TH, 
19:19:33 2021 AT 10:00 A.M. IN THE ARDENWOOD ROOM AT THE CITY HALL, BUILDING A, AND THEN OF COURSE THE THIRD 
19:19:42 RECOMMENDATION IS TO FIND THE PROJECT EXEMPT UNDER CEQA GUIDELINES.

19:21:24 RODRIGUES FARMHOUSE REGISTER LISTING AND MILLS ACT CONTRACT, 41948 MISSION BOULEVARD.

19:21:37 AND I BELIEVE THAT SENIOR PLANNER BILL ROTH IS PROVIDING A PRESENTATION, AND THE APPLICANT WILL ALSO HAVE A VERBAL 
19:21:40 PRESENTATION FOLLOWING HIM FOR 10 MINUTES AND THAT WILL BE PRESENTED BITTERY WONG.

19:21:56  BY TERRY WONG.
WELCOME.
MY APOLOGIES.

19:22:16 BILL, I'M HAVING DIFFICULTIES HEARING YOU.
>> I APOLOGIZE.

19:22:28 CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW?
>> Mayor Mei: YES.
>> TONIGHT'S HEARING CONCERNS A 
19:22:34 POTENTIAL REGISTRY LISTING AND MILLS CONTRACT FOR THE PUMP HOUSE, MILHOUS AND TANKHOUSE.

19:22:40 IN PRIOR REVIEW THE PROPERTY WAS FOUND ELIGIBLE FOR THE STATE AND POTENTIALLY NATIONAL HISTORIC REGISTRIES FOR ITS 
19:22:49 SIGNIFICANT ASSOCIATION WITH LOCAL PORTUGUESE SETTLEMENT PATTERNS AND AGRICULTURAL HISTORY AS AN EXAMPLE OF 
19:22:55 AN EARLY FARM AND IN REGARDS TO ITS ARCHITECTURE WHICH IS A FARMHOUSE BUILT IN THE 1890s, IT'S A  
19:22:59 DISTINGUISHED EXAMPLE OF FARMHOUSE ARCTIC YOU'RE BUILT IN THE VERNACULAR STYLE OF THAT TIME.

19:23:07 THE SUBJECT PROPERTY IS LOCATED IN THE WESTERN CORNER OF THE HOBBS PLANNED DISTRICT WHICH WAS APPROVED BY CITY 
19:23:12 COUNCIL IN 2017.
HISTORICAL ARCHITECTURAL REVIEW WAS DONE AT THAT TIME TO ENSURE THE 
19:23:18 HISTORIC CHARACTER OF THE RODRIGUES PROPERTY WOULD BE PRESERVED.
AS PART OF THAT PROJECT, THE RODRIGUES 
19:23:24 FARMHOUSE WAS LEFT IN PLACE ON A LARGE 11,000 SQUARE FOOT LOT, SEPARATING IT FROM THE NEW HOMES WITH LANDSCAPING 
19:23:29 AND A ROAD.
THE 55 SINGLE-FAMILY HOMES IN THE NEW SUBDIVISION NOW CALLED ORCHARD HEIGHTS 
19:23:35 ARE ALMOST ALL BUILT OUT AT THIS POINT.
AT THE TIME OF THE APPROVAL OF THE 
19:23:40 HOBBS PLANNED DISTRICT, THE APPLICANT EXPRESSED THEIR INTENT TO RETURN TO HARB WITH A PROPOSAL TO REHABILITATE 
19:23:50 THE RECORD FARMHOUSE SO IT COULD BE AGAIN USED AS A SINGLE-FAMILY HOME.
IN 2018, A REHABILITATION PROPOSAL FOR 
19:23:54 THE RODRIGUES PROPERTY WAS TAKEN BEFORE HARB.
THE APPROVAL AUTHORITY FOR PROPOSED 
19:23:59 MODIFICATIONS TO POTENTIAL HISTORIC REGISTER RESOURCES.
THAT REHABILITATION PROJECT WAS 
19:24:06 APPROVED AND HAS NOW BEEN COMPLETED AS SHOWN ON THE  AS-BUILT PLANS THAT ARE INCLUDED IN THE AGENDA PACKET.

19:24:11 THE PROJECT IDENTIFIED THE NEED FOR CONSIDERABLE REPAIR TO THE FARMHOUSE TO MAKE IT SUITABLE AGAIN FOR 
19:24:18 SINGLE-FAMILY USE, AND INCLUDED A 1500 SQUARE FOOT ADDITION TO THE REAR OF THE HOUSE AND A NEW TWO-CAR DETACHED 
19:24:24 GARAGE.
THE TANKHOUSE, PUMP HOUSE AND THE ABOVE GROUND PORTION OF THE WATER WELL 
19:24:29 OR WELL LIP AS IT'S CALLED WERE ALSO APPROVED TO BE RELOCATED TO THE REAR OF THAT PROPOSED ADDITION TO THE 
19:24:37 FARMHOUSE.
AS PART OF THAT REVIEW IN 2018, A CONDITIONS ASSESSMENT AND TREATMENT 
19:24:43 RECOMMENDATIONS AND A PROJECT IMPACT ANALYSIS WERE PREPARED BY A CONSULTANT TO EVALUATE THE THEN CURRENT CONDITION 
19:24:49 OF THE PROPERTY AND THE POTENTIAL EFFECTS OF THE REHABILITATION PROJECT ON THE HISTORIC CHARACTER OF THE 
19:24:54 FARMHOUSE AND THE OTHER TWO STRUCTURES.
THOSE -- PARDON ME, THOSE DOCUMENTS 
19:24:59 INCLUDED RECOMMENDATIONS TO ENSURE THAT THOSE STRUCTURES, ONCE THEY WERE RELOCATED AND REHABILITATED, WOULD 
19:25:05 STILL BE ELIGIBLE FOR  LISTING AS HISTORIC RESOURCES.
THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THOSE 
19:25:11 REPORTS BECAME MITIGATION MEASURES AND CONDITIONS OF APPROVAL THAT WERE ULTIMATELY ADOPTED BY HARB FOR THAT 
19:25:17 REHABILITATION PROJECT IN 2018.
AFTER THAT APPROVAL, THE APPLICANT SUBMITTED BUILDING PERMIT APPLICATIONS 
19:25:31 FOR THE ACTUAL CONSTRUCTION WORK.
AS REQUIRED PER THE CONDITIONS OF APPROVAL, AN ARCHITECTURAL HISTORIAN 
19:25:37 REVIEWED ALSO A CONSTRUCTION MONITOR WAS HIRED TO OBSERVE THE INTEGRITY OF THE EXISTING MATERIALS AS THEY WERE 
19:25:42 UNCOVERED IN THE FIELD TO HELP DETERMINE WHAT COULD BE RE-USED AND WHAT NEEDED TO BE REPLACED IN KIND, 
19:25:48 AND HELP ENSURE THAT THE ACTUAL CONSTRUCTION WORK ADHERED TO THOSE SECRETARY'S STANDARDS.

19:25:53 BOTH OF THOSE CONSULTANTS MET THE SECRETARY'S QUALIFICATION STANDARDS TO WORK AS ARCHITECTURAL HISTORIANS.

19:26:00 THE CONSULTANTS ALSO REVIEWED THE FINISHED PROJECT, WHICH WAS DONE JUST A COUPLE MONTHS AGO, AND THEY PROVIDED 
19:26:06 WRITTEN CONFIRMATION THAT IT WAS STILL CONSISTENT WITH THE SECRETARY'S STANDARDS, SATISFIED THOSE HARB 
19:26:13 CONDITIONS OF APPROVAL FROM 2018, AND FOUND THAT IT'S STILL ELIGIBLE FOR HISTORIC REGISTER LISTING AFTER THE 
19:26:19 WORK HAS BEEN DONE.
SO NOW WE'RE LOOKING AT THE FARMHOUSE, A BEFORE AND AFTER.

19:26:25 THE CHARACTER DEFINING FEATURES OF THE FARMHOUSE ARE THE WOOD FRAME CONSTRUCTION, ITS  ONE-STORY HEIGHT, 
19:26:34 ITS GABLED ROOF MASSING, ITS CHANNEL -- SIDING ON THE FRONT TWO WINGS, WOOD BEVEL SIDING ON THE REAR WING, WOOD 
19:26:40 SASH DOUBLE HUNG WINDOWS, BOXED EAVES AND EVE RETURNS, AND ITS FRONT PORCH WITH WOOD SUPPORTS.

19:26:47 THE APPLICANT WILL LIKELY GO INTO MORE DETAIL REGARDING THE TIME, EFFORT AND COST INVOLVED WITH REHABILITATING A 
19:26:53 PROPERTY LIKE THIS, BUT IT SHOULD BE  NOTED THAT IT WAS IN TERRIBLE CONDITION.

19:26:59 STAFF WENT INSIDE AT ONE POINT, HAD VIRTUALLY NO FOUNDATION, VERY DETERIORATED ROOF AND WATER DAMAGE 
19:27:08 INSIDE AS A RESULT, AND IT REALLY HAD A STRONG SMELL OF MOLD.
SHOWN HERE ARE THE BEFORE AND AFTER 
19:27:13 PHOTOS OF THE SMALL PUMP HOUSE OVER THE WELL, AND THE TANKHOUSE.
THE CHARACTER DEFINING FEATURES OF THE 
19:27:21 PUMP HOUSE ARE ITS WOOD BOARDS COVERING THE WELL LIP, ITS SMALL RECTANGULAR WOOD PUMP HOUSE FORM LOCATED ON TOP OF 
19:27:29 THE WELL LIP AND THEN THAT CIRCULAR BRICK WELL LIP.
THE CHARACTER DEFINING FEATURES OF THE 
19:27:36 TANK FARM ARE ITS ONE FRAME CONSTRUCTION, SQUARE PLAN, CONCRETE FOUNDATION, FLAT ROOF, ENTRANCE WITH 
19:27:43 WOODEN DOOR ON THE EAST FACADE AND ITS WOOD SASH DOUBLE HUNG WINDOWS.
ALL OF THE REHABILITATION WORK AND THE 
19:27:49 ADDITION TO THE HOUSE AND NEW DETACHED GARAGE IS ALL DONE.
THERE ARE NO PHYSICAL CHANGES TO THE 
19:27:53 STRUCTURES PROPOSED AT TONIGHT'S HEARING.
UNDER REVIEW TONIGHT ARE THE PROPOSED 
19:27:58 REGISTER LISTING AND THE MILLS -- CONTRACT FOR THE PROPERTY AS IT EXISTS TODAY.

19:28:05 SO THE MILLS ACT PROGRAM, IT ALLOWS PRIVATE PROPERTY OWNERS TO QUALIFY FOR TAX RELIEF IF THEY PLEDGE TO 
19:28:10 REHABILITATE AND MAINTAIN THE HISTORICAL ARCHITECTURAL CHARACTER OF THE PROPERTY FOR AT LEAST A 10-YEAR 
19:28:17 PERIOD.
THE DIAZ HOUSE DOWN THE STREET FROM THIS PROPERTY AND ALSO THE SILVA HOUSE 
19:28:22 AT THE PLANNED DISTRICT IN WARM SPRINGS ARE TWO RECENT EXAMPLES OF HISTORIC HOUSES IN FREMONT THAT HAVE BEEN 
19:28:28 PRESERVED IN THE MILLS ACT.
THE CONTRACT REQUIRES THE PROPERTY OWNER TO MAINTAIN THOSE CHARACTER 
19:28:33 DEFINING FEATURES THAT WE WENT OVER EARLIER.
IT GOES FROM ONE PROPERTY OWNER TO THE 
19:28:41 NEXT IF THE PROPERTY IS SOLD, AND IN ORDER FOR A PROPERTY SUCH AS THIS TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR MILLS ACT, IT FIRST 
19:28:45 MUST BE ADDED TO THE FREMONT REGISTER, WHICH IS THE FIRST ITEM ON THE AGENDA HERE.

19:28:51 SO THAT CONCLUDES STAFF'S  REPORT.
STAFF RECOMMENDS THAT THE PROPERTY BE ADDED TO THE REGISTER AND THE MILLS 
19:28:57 ACT CONTRACT BE APPROVED.
THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:29:03 AT THIS TIME, I'LL TURN IT OVER TO -- FOR QUESTIONS.
I SEE COUNCILMEMBER SHAO, DID YOU HAVE 
19:29:07 A QUESTION ON THIS?
>> Vice Mayor Shao: THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR.

19:29:17 SINCE THE 10-YEAR TERM IS BROUGHT UP ABOUT THE MILLS ACT CONTRACT REGARDING THE PROPERTY TAX RELIEF, MY QUESTION 
19:29:28 IS IF ON THE 11TH YEAR, A PROPERTY OWNER DECIDES TO MAKE SOME CHANGES, SIGNIFICANT OR INSIGNIFICANT TO THE 
19:29:34 STRUCTURE OF THE BUILDING, WILL THE PROPERTY TAX RELIEF BE LIFTED OR CONTINUE?

19:29:40 >> WELL, IF THEY WANTED TO GO BEYOND THAT 10-YEAR PERIOD, THEY'D HAVE TO CONTINUE THE AGREEMENT, THE CITY WOULD 
19:29:45 HAVE TO AGREE TO THAT.
ANY SORT OF CHANGES MADE TO THE HOUSE, WHETHER IT'S UNDER THE AGREEMENT OR 
19:29:57 NOT, WOULD STILL BE SUBJECT TO THE CITY OF FREMONT'S HISTORICAL CODE THAT PROTECTS WHAT THIS MAY BE A POTENTIAL 
19:30:02 REGISTER RESOURCE TONIGHT.
EVEN ELIGIBLE AND NOT LISTED STILL GET THAT PROTECTION IN FREMONT BUT THE BEN 
19:30:10  BENEFIT HERE IS THE PROPERTY OWNER HAS THE INCENTIVE BY GIVING THAT PROPERTY TAX RELIEF TO ACTUALLY SPEND THAT 
19:30:14 MONEY.
AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE CONDITION OF THE HOUSE PREVIOUS TO THIS, IT WAS IN 
19:30:19 TERRIBLE CONDITION, SO THAT'S THE BONUS, I GUESS, OF ADDING THE CONTRACT.

19:30:24 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
I DON'T SEE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COUNCILMEMBERS.

19:30:37 ARE THERE ANY -- COUNCILMEMBER KENG, CLARIFYING QUESTION?
>> Councilmember Keng: SINCE IT WOULD 
19:30:45 BE TAX EXEMPT, WOULD THE PROPERTY BE ABLE TO HAVE OCCUPANTS?
>> YES, THE PROPERTY CAN LIVE THERE, 
19:30:51 THEY CAN, YOU KNOW, HAVE FAMILY LIVING THERE, JUST LIKE ANY OTHER SINGLE-FAMILY HOUSE IN FREMONT.

19:31:02 >> Councilmember Keng: OKAY.
SO WOULD IT BE -- LIKE WHAT KIND OF EXEMPTIONS ARE WE LOOKING AT?

19:31:09 >> WELL, THEY GET PROPERTY TAX RELIEF AND IT VARIES ON THE PROPERTY IN SORT OF THE WAY IT CALCULATED.

19:31:18 THERE'S SORT OF A FAIRLY LONG DOCUMENT THAT EXPLAINS IT, BUT ONE OF THE MOST COMMON WAYS IS ON THE ASSESSED RENTAL 
19:31:22 VALUE OF A PROPERTY.
I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THAT WOULD BE FOR THIS PARTICULAR PROPERTY YET, 
19:31:30 BUT SOME OTHER EXAMPLES NOT JUST IN FREMONT, IT CAN BE A DEDUCTION OF THEIR PROPERTY TAX BILL OF 15,000 OR 
19:31:36 20,000, YOU KNOW, OF COURSE THE CITY'S PORTION OF THAT IS MUCH SMALLER THAN THAT, BUT THAT'S BASICALLY WHAT A 
19:31:44 PROPERTY OWNER GETS IN TERMS OF THE RELIEF.
>> Councilmember Keng: THANK  YOU.

19:31:46 >> SURE.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
CLARIFYING QUESTIONS?

19:31:53 COUNCILMEMBER COX?
>> Councilmember Cox: THANK YOU.
THANK YOU SO MUCH, BILL, FOR YOUR 
19:32:01 REPORT AND YOUR TEAM'S EFFORT.
I WANTED TO FIND OUT IN THE EVENT THAT WE'VE DONE -- THEY'VE DONE ALL THE 
19:32:11 REMODELING AND MEETING ALL OF THE HISTORICAL SOCIETY STANDARDS, BUT WHAT HAPPENS IF THERE IS SOME SORT OF BREAK 
19:32:18 IN THE PIPES THAT WOULD HAVE TO CHANGE THE STRUCTURE OF THE HOUSE, COULD YOU KIND OF WALK ME THROUGH WHAT WOULD BE 
19:32:28 THE PROCESS SINCE IT'S CLASSIFIED AS HISTORICAL?
>> I THINK WE'RE ALWAYS SUPPORTIVE OF 
19:32:32 MAINTAINING HISTORIC STRUCTURES AND SHOULD IT BE ADDED TO THE REGISTER TONIGHT, THAT'S WHAT IT WOULD BE, BUT 
19:32:37 IT'S ALREADY AN ELIGIBLE HISTORIC STRUCTURE.
SO LET'S SAY A PIPE BURST AND THEY HAD 
19:32:42 SOME TERRIBLE DAMAGE, THEY WOULD COME TO THE CITY BASICALLY FOR A BUILDING PERMIT TO RESTORE THE STRUCTURE TO 
19:32:47 WHAT IT WAS.
IF THEY WANTED TO DO ANY ALTERATIONS BEYOND RESTORING THE PROPERTY TO WHAT 
19:32:54 IT IS, WE'D LIKELY HAVE TO GO TO THE HARB SECRETARY OR IF HE DIDN'T FEEL THAT IT WAS APPROPRIATE FOR HIM TO 
19:33:00 MAKE THAT DECISION, HE COULD ESCALATE TO THE HISTORIC ARCHITECTURAL REVIEW BOARD.

19:33:06 CERTAINLY IF IT WAS A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE THEY  PROPOSED, IT WOULD JUST GO STRAIGHT TO HARB, THE HISTORICAL 
19:33:11 ARCHITECTURAL REVIEW BOARD, AT A PUBLIC HEARING.
BUT IF IT WAS JUST A MATTER OF MAIN 
19:33:16  MAINTAINING OR REPLACING SOMETHING WHERE THE EXTERIOR OF THE STRUCTURE WOULDN'T BE  CHANGED, THEN WE COULD 
19:33:19 LIKELY DO THAT THROUGH A BUILDING PERMIT WITHOUT HAVING TO GO BACK TO HEARING.

19:33:25 BUT IF THEY'RE MAKING A CHANGE, THEN IT FALLS UNDER ALL OF THE PROVISIONS TO PROTECT HISTORIC RESOURCES AND SO THEN 
19:33:30 WE'RE LOOKING AT THOSE  CHARACTER-DEFINING FEATURES AND MAKING SURE THAT THOSE AREN'T BEING CHANGED 
19:33:33 AND IF THERE ARE ANY MODIFICATIONS, WE'RE GOING TO GO TO A PUBLIC HEARING WITH HARB.

19:33:42 >> Councilmember Cox: IS THERE ANY EXCEPTION IF THERE'S AN EARTHQUAKE AND THERE'S -- YOU KNOW, IT STILL WOULD 
19:33:48 FALL UNDER WHAT YOU JUST DESCRIBED, EVEN IN THE EVENT OF AN EARTHQUAKE THAT COULD BE, GOD FORBID, COULD BE 
19:33:57 VERY MAJOR, AND ARE THERE EXCEPTIONS UNDER HISTORICAL CLASSIFICATION FOR EARTHQUAKES SINCE WE ARE IN AN 
19:34:03 EARTHQUAKE ZONED AREA?
>> WELL, IN TERMS OF DOING A REPAIR AND REPLACE, IT WOULD BE THE SAME AS I 
19:34:07 SAID FOR A BURST PIPE, BUT I MEAN, THERE'S ALWAYS DISCRETION THE CITY HAS.

19:34:12 IF WE HAD A TERRIBLE EARTHQUAKE AND THERE WAS A FAULT RIGHT THROUGH THE PROPERTY AND THERE WAS NO WAY YOU 
19:34:17 COULD BUILD A HOUSE THERE AND HAD TO RELOCATE IT OR SOMETHING ALONG THOSE LINES, YOU KNOW, WE WOULD DO 
19:34:23 ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW FOR THE RELOCATION OF THE PROPERTY.
AND IT JUST -- YOU KNOW, THERE'S SO 
19:34:30 MANY HYPOTHETICALS THERE, BUT AN HISTORICAL PROPERTY, IF THE DECISION-MAKING BODY WANTS TO MAKE 
19:34:37 THAT DECISION CAN ADOPT AN ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT, MAKE WHAT ARE CALLED STATEMENT OF OVERRIDING 
19:34:41 CONSIDERATIONS WHERE THERE'S OTHER THINGS THAT OUTWEIGH THAT IMPACT, AND MOVE FORWARD WITH THE PROJECT.

19:34:49 IT A LONG INVOLVED PROCESS, AND THERE ARE JUST SO MANY HYPOTHETICALS THERE.
BUT YOU KNOW --

19:34:52 >> Councilmember Cox: ONE LAST QUESTION.
IN TERMS OF IN THE CONTRACT PROVISION, 
19:35:02 THERE IS INFORMATION COMPLIANCE, AND IS THAT SOMETHING THAT THEY TAKE PICTURES EVERY YEAR, SUBMIT IT WITH A WRITTEN 
19:35:07 REPORT THAT THERE HASN'T BEEN ANY CHANGES SINCE THE LAST BUILDING PERMIT OR WHAT DOES THAT ALL ENTAIL?

19:35:12 I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THAT ASPECT OF IT.
>> THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.

19:35:18 I'LL HAVE TO LOOK AT THE CONTRACT RIGHT NOW TO BE SURE OF WHAT THAT SAYS.
I'M NOT SURE IF SOMEBODY ELSE IS ABLE 
19:35:30 TO ANSWER THAT OFF THE TOP OF THEIR HEAD.
>> Mayor Mei: WELL, I WAS GOING TO SAY 
19:35:36 WE CAN SEE IF WE HAVE ANYONE ON THAT BUT ALSO WE HAVE THE APPLICANT WHO'S GOING TO BE GIVING A PRESENTATION AND 
19:35:42 PERHAPS IT WILL BE ADDRESSED IN THAT.
>> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.
LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

19:35:46 >> Mayor Mei: SURE.
SO NEXT WE HAVE A PRESENTATION, 10 MINUTES, IF THE CLERK WOULD BE SO KIND 
19:35:53 AS TO START THE  TIMER, AND I BELIEVE TERRY FROM ROBSON HOMES IS GOING TO BE MAKING A PRESENTATION TOO.

19:36:03 WELCOME.
>> THANK YOU, MAYOR MEI.
CAN YOU SEE MY SCREEN?

19:36:11 >> Mayor Mei: YES.
>> OKAY.
THANK YOU, MAYOR MEI AND MEMBERS OF 
19:36:18 COUNCIL.
MY NAME IS TERRY WANG WITH  ROBSON HOMES.

19:36:25 THE FREMONT REGISTER AND THE MILLS ACT, I WILL DISCUSS MORE PERSONAL ASPECTS AS IT RELATES TO THE RODRIGUES FAMILY 
19:36:32 ALONG WITH SOME OF THE KEY ASPECTS OF THE REHABILITATION PROCESS.
BEFORE I START, I DID WANT TO THANK 
19:36:40 MARY SCOTT, WHO IS THE GRANDDAUGHTER OF MANUEL AND MARY RODRIGUES.
SHE'S A LIFELONG RESIDENT OF FREMONT 
19:36:46 AND I WAS ABLE TO MEET HER IN 2019, AND SHE'S THE ONE THAT PROVIDED THE PICTURES OF THE FAMILY PHOTOGRAPHS 
19:37:01 YOU'LL SEE IN THE PRESENTATION.
SO THE STORY OF RODRIGUES FAMILY BEGINS IN 1893, WHEN MANUEL RODRIGUES 
19:37:07 PURCHASES THE FIVE ACRES OUT OF COUNTY ROAD NUMBER 12.
TODAY, IT'S KNOWN AS MISSION 
19:37:11 BOULEVARD.
MANUEL CAME TO CALIFORNIA IN 1890 AS PART OF A LARGER MIGRATION OF 
19:37:18 PORTUGUESE IMMIGRANTS FROM THE AZORES.
MANY OF THESE IMMIGRANTS TOOK UP RESIDENCE IN ALAMEDA COUNTY AND MADE 
19:37:25 THEIR LIVING BY FARMING.
IN 1895, MANUEL MARRIED THE DAUGHTER OF PORTUGUESE IMMIGRANTS WHO WERE ALSO 
19:37:33 FROM THE AZORES AND HIS WIFE, MARY, WAS BORN IN CALIFORNIA.
IT'S NOT KNOWN IF THERE WAS A PREVIOUS 
19:37:40 RESIDENCE ON THE PROPERTY IN 1893, WHEN IT WAS PURCHASED.
HOWEVER, FROM COUNTY RECORDS, WE DO 
19:37:46 KNOW THAT IN 1896, ABOUT THE TIME THEY GOT MARRIED AND HAD THEIR FIRST CHILD, THE RODRIGUES FAMILY WENT ABOUT 
19:37:52 CONSTRUCTING A NEW HOUSE FOR THEIR GROWING FAMILY.
THIS PICTURE IS OF THE RODRIGUES 
19:38:04 FAMILY TAKEN BETWEEN 1914 AND 1916.
IT SHOWS 13 OF THEIR 15  CHILDREN.
SO WHAT'S UNIQUE ABOUT THE 
19:38:10 CONSTRUCTION OF THE RODRIGUES FARMHOUSE IS THAT IT WAS BUILT IN PHASES, AND THE PHASES REFLECT THE LIFE STAGES OF 
19:38:16 THE RODRIGUES FAMILY.
AND MODERN LIVING AMENITIES OF THE TIME.

19:38:25 THIS SHOWS THE ORIGINAL NORTH ELEVATION OF THE HOUSE IN 2018, BEFORE WE DID THE  REHABILITATION, AND YOU CAN SEE 
19:38:29 THREE DISTINCT SECTIONS.
EACH SECTION WAS BUILT AT A DIFFERENT TIME, AND BASED ON THE CONSTRUCTION 
19:38:36 METHODS THAT WE DISCOVERED DURING THE REHABILITATION PROCESS, WE NOW BELIEVE THAT THE MILL SECTION WAS CONSTRUCTED 
19:38:43 FIRST IN 1896, AFTER THEY WERE MARRIED.
THEN AS THE FAMILY GREW, THE FRONT 
19:38:49 SECTION WAS ADDED IN 1900.
AND AT THAT TIME, BY THAT TIME, MANUEL AND MARY HAD FIVE CHILDREN.

19:38:58 AND FINALLY, IN THE 1940s, WHEN INDOOR PLUMBING BECAME MORE OF THE NORM, THE REAR SECTION WAS ADDED, AND THAT 
19:39:05 SECTION CONTAINED A KITCHEN AND A BATHROOM.
SO UNDERSTANDING THAT THE CONSTRUCTION 
19:39:12 WAS PHASED TO MEET THE NEEDS OF A GROWING MODERN FAMILY INFLUENCED THE REHABILITATION PLANS FOR THE RODRIGUES 
19:39:23 HOUSE.
THE LAND AND FARMHOUSE REMAINED IN THE RODRIGUES FAMILY FOR OVER 80 YEARS.

19:39:31 FROM 1893 TO 1976.
THE PICTURE ON THE LEFT SHOWS MARY RODRIGUES AROUND 1940 STANDING IN 
19:39:39 FRONT OF THE FARMHOUSE PORCH BEFORE CHURCH.
THE TWO PICTURES ON THE RIGHT ARE FROM 
19:39:44 1976.
THE TOP SHOWS MANUEL AND MARY'S GRANDDAUGHTER, JOSEPHINE, STANDING IN 
19:39:51 FRONT OF THE COVERED PORCH, AND THE BOTTOM SHOWS THE TANKHOUSE WITH A WATER TANK STILL ON TOP.

19:40:04 BY 2018, PORTIONS OF THE RODRIGUES FARMHOUSE WERE OVER 120 YEARS OLD.
BY THAT TIME, THE FARMHOUSE WAS A 
19:40:11 FIXTURE ON MISSION BOULEVARD.
THE FARMHOUSE'S SIMPLE LINES WERE VISIBLE FROM THE ROAD FOR ALL WHO 
19:40:21 DROVE BY, HARKENING BACK TO FREMONT'S FARMING ROOTS.
BUT ALSO BY 2018, THE  FARMHOUSE'S AGE 
19:40:28 WAS SHOWING.
THERE WAS MUCH WORK TO BE DONE TO MAKE IT HABITABLE FOR A MODERN FAMILY TO 
19:40:32 LIVE IN.
THE CHALLENGE WAS DETERMINING HOW TO HONOR THE HISTORY OF A 
19:40:39 100-PLUS-YEAR-OLD FARMHOUSE AND YET PROVIDE THE SPACE AND MODERN AMENITIES FOR A 21ST CENTURY FAMILY AND BEYOND.

19:40:54 ROBSON HOMES AT ARCHITECT CARUSO DESIGNS CAME UP WITH A PLAN DEMOLISHING THE REAR ADDITION AND 
19:41:01 ADDING A NEW REAR ADDITION.
YOU CAN SEE HERE THE FRONT TWO SECTIONS THAT WERE  REHABILITATED.

19:41:08 THE ORIGINAL REAR SECTION ADDITION WOULD BE REMOVED AND REPLACED WITH A NEW REAR ADDITION.

19:41:17 THE NEW ADDITION WOULD BE SECONDARY AND SUBSERVIENT TO THE ORIGINAL PORTION OF THE HOUSE BY ITS LOCATION IN THE REAR 
19:41:23 AND BY THE PLACEMENT OF THE ROOF LINE, WHICH IS BELOW THE CENTER CROSS GABLE.

19:41:32 THE NEW ADDITION WAS ALSO BUILT INTO THE HILL, UTILIZING A BASEMENT WITH A LIGHT WELL AND THIS WAS APPROVED BY 
19:41:38 HARB IN MAY OF 2018.
THE MAY 2018 PLAN ALSO PRESERVED AND REHABILITATED THE TANKHOUSE AND THE 
19:41:44 PUMP HOUSE OVER THE BRICK LINE WELL LIT.
THE TANKHOUSE WAS BUILT IN 1912, AND 
19:41:51 THE WELL WAS DUG AT THE SAME TIME.
THE SMALL PUMP HOUSE WAS ADDED IN THE 1940s.

19:42:01 THOSE STRUCTURES WERE MOVED FROM THEIR ORIGINAL LOCATION BEHIND THE ORIGINAL FARMHOUSE TO A NEW LOCATION BEHIND THE 
19:42:08 REHABILITATED FARMHOUSE.
THE REHABILITATION TOOK PLACE BETWEEN 2019 AND 2021.

19:42:16 THE HISTORIC ASPECTS OF CONSTRUCTION WERE MONITORED BY CONSTRUCTION MONITOR AND PRESERVATION ARCHITECT.

19:42:23 THE HOUSE WAS RAISED OFF ITS ORIGINAL FOUNDATION, PUT ON  CRIBBING IN ORDER TO BUILD A PROPER MODERN FOUNDATION, 
19:42:30 SO THE PICTURE ON THE LEFT IS THE NORTH ELEVATION RAISED UP ON CRIBBING READY TO BE LOWERED.

19:42:37 THE PICTURE ON THE RIGHT, YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE REAR OF THE FARMHOUSE, AND THE ORIGINAL REAR ADDITION HAS 
19:42:44 BEEN REMOVED.
WHEN YOU TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT THE PICTURE ON THE LEFT, YOU CAN SEE THE 
19:42:50 SIDING IS LABELED.
THIS WAS TO PRESERVE AND RE-USE THE ORIGINAL SIDING WHEN POSSIBLE.

19:42:55 EACH PIECE WAS LABELED BEFORE IT WAS REMOVED SO WE KNEW WHERE IT CAME FROM, WHAT PART OF THE HOUSE, AND THE PIECES 
19:43:01 WERE SORTED TO SEE WHICH ONES COULD BE SALVAGED AND RE-USED.
AND IF YOU LOOK ON THE PICTURE ON THE 
19:43:08 RIGHT, YOU CAN SEE WHERE THE REAR ADDITION WAS REMOVED AND YOU CAN SEE THE EXPOSED ORIGINAL SIDING 
19:43:15 UNDERNEATH.
HERE'S THE FRONT SECTION OF THE FARMHOUSE STRIPPED DOWN TO ITS STUDS, 
19:43:22 AND SITTING ON THE NEW FOUNDATION.
THE TANKHOUSE WENT THROUGH THE SAME PROCESS.

19:43:29 THE SIDING WAS STRIPPED, THE BOARDS LABELED AND THEY WERE SORTED TO BE SAVED FOR RE-USE.

19:43:37 THIS IS THE LIP OF THE BRICK LINED WELL THAT WAS ALSO SAVED AND MOVED TO A NEW LOCATION.

19:43:49 SO AFTER TWO YEARS, HERE IS THE TANKHOUSE, THE PUMP HOUSE AND WELL LIP AFTER THE COMPLETED REHABILITATION.

19:43:58 AND HERE'S THE REHABILITATED RODRIGUES FARMHOUSE.
ON THE NEXT TWO SLIDES, I JUST WANT TO 
19:44:04 POINT OUT HOW THE FORM OF THE ORIGINAL FARMHOUSE IS PRESERVED IN THE REHABILITATION.

19:44:12 AND THIS WAS THE DESIGN VISION OF THE ARCHITECTS, THAT THE ARCHITECTS AND THE HISTORIANS LAID OUT.

19:44:18 ACCENTUATE THE ORIGINAL FORM OF THE FRONT TWO SECTIONS OF THE FARMHOUSE.
SO FROM SOME ANGLE, YOU'LL SEE THE NEW 
19:44:25 ADDITION, BUT THE DESIGN IS TO KEEP THOSE -- THAT NEW ADDITION SECONDARY TO THE ORIGINAL.

19:44:39 SO THESE ARE PICTURES KIND OF UP CLOSE OF THE FRONT OF THE FARMHOUSE BEFORE THE REHABILITATION, AND THESE ARE SAME 
19:44:44 ANGLES AFTERWARDS, AND YOU CAN SEE THAT THE DESIGN HIGHLIGHTS THE FORM OF THE FRONT TWO SECTIONS.

19:44:56 AND HERE IS THE VIEW FROM MISSION BOULEVARD FROM BEFORE.
AND THIS IS THE VIEW FROM MISSION 
19:45:02 BOULEVARD AFTER.
AND ALTHOUGH YOU CAN STILL -- YOU CAN SEE THE REAR ADDITION, IT'S 36 FEET 
19:45:09 BEHIND THE FRONT FACADE, AND SUBSERVIENT TO THE ORIGINAL.
SO THE RODRIGUES FARMHOUSE READS THE 
19:45:15 SAME WAY TO CARS DRIVING BY ON MISSION BOULEVARD TODAY AS IT DID TO CARS DRIVING BY A HUNDRED YEARS AGO.

19:45:25 AS PART OF THE PROJECT'S HISTORIC MITIGATION CONDITIONS, WE DOCUMENTED THE FARMHOUSE FOR THE SECRETARY OF 
19:45:35 INTERIOR STANDARDS.
THIS INCLUDES DRAWINGS, PHOTOGRAPHS, AN HISTORIC REPORT AND INTERPRETIVE 
19:45:42 DISPLAY, SO THE INTERPRETIVE DISPLAY IS PLACED NEXT TO THE FARMHOUSE.
SO YOU CAN SEE THE SIGN HERE IN THE 
19:45:48 LOWER RIGHT CORNER OF THE PICTURE, SO IF YOU HAPPEN TO WALK BY AND YOU SEE THE FARMHOUSE THAT FRONTS MISSION 
19:45:52 BOULEVARD, YOU'RE ABLE TO READ THE HISTORY OF THE FARMHOUSE AND THE RODRIGUES FAMILY.

19:46:01 SO WHAT DOES THE FUTURE HOLD FOR THE RODRIGUES FARMHOUSE?
TONIGHT WE'RE ASKING CITY COUNCIL TO 
19:46:05 TAKE TWO IMPORTANT STEPS TO HELP SECURE THE FUTURE OF THE RODRIGUES FARMHOUSE.

19:46:10 THE FIRST STEP IS TO FORMALLY FIND THE RODRIGUES FARMHOUSE TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR THE FREMONT REGISTER AND THE SECOND IS 
19:46:17 APPROVING THE USE OF THE MILLS ACT TO PRESERVE THE RODRIGUES FARMHOUSE ON AN ONGOING BASIS.

19:46:25 AND THOSE ARE THE TWO STEPS WE'RE ASKING CITY COUNCIL TO TAKE.
AND I WANT TO END WITH A PICTURE OF 
19:46:31 MARY SCOTT.
THIS IS MARY SCOTT ON THE PORCH WITH HER GRANDSON AND HER GRANDDAUGHTER IN 
19:46:39 LAW, AND TWO OF HER GREAT GRANDDAUGHTERS.
AND THEY'RE STANDING ON THE PORCH OF 
19:46:47 HER GRANDPARENTS'  HOUSE.
SO IF YOU ARE COUNTING, IF YOU INCLUDE THE FARMHOUSE THAT MANUEL AND MARY 
19:46:58 BUILT, THIS  SPANS SIX GENERATIONS WITH TIES TO THE RODRIGUES FARMHOUSE.
SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND 
19:47:00 CONSIDERATION.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
TIME IS UP, BUT THANK YOU.

19:47:11 ARE THERE ANY CLARIFYING QUESTIONS FROM THE  COUNCILMEMBERS AT THIS TIME?
OKAY.

19:47:18 PLANNER ROTH?
>> I COULD CLARIFY THE QUESTION I WASN'T ABLE TO ANSWER EARLIER.

19:47:24 IF I COULD JUST SHARE MY SCREEN JUST FOR ONE MOMENT, I CAN SHOW THAT MILLS ACT CONTRACT.

19:47:29 IT WILL JUST TAKE A MOMENT.
SO THERE IS A QUESTION ABOUT SORT OF WHAT CAN THE CITY DO TO MAKE SURE THAT 
19:47:37 THE PROJECT IS IN COMPLIANCE WITH OUR HISTORIC REQUIREMENTS FOR OUR CODE.
SO THIS IS ONE PROVISION, IT'S 
19:47:44 PROVISION 3C, IT JUST SAYS THAT THE OWNER IS REQUIRED TO ALLOW FOR PERIODIC EXAMINATIONS, YOU KNOW, OF 
19:47:50 THE INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR CHARACTER DEFINING FEATURES AND THAT INCLUDES BY THE CITY, AND THEN THERE'S ALSO A 
19:47:55 PROVISION FURTHER DOWN HERE WHICH JUST SAYS THAT THE OWNER AGREES TO FURNISH THE CITY WITH ANY AND ALL INFORMATION 
19:48:00  REQUESTED.
SO MAYBE IN THAT CASE OF AN EARTHQUAKE OR PLUMBING OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT, IT 
19:48:08 WOULD BE A VISIT BY CITY STAFF, MAYBE A BUILDING INSPECTOR TO VERIFY THAT THAT DAMAGE OCCURRED, AND IF THERE WAS ANY 
19:48:14 REQUEST BASED ON THAT DAMAGE TO MAKE A MODIFICATION, WE WOULD HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE AGREE 
19:48:23 WITH THE RATIONALE FOR THAT, FOR EXAMPLE.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU FOR THAT 
19:48:26 CLARIFICATION.
I SEE HANDS RAISED.
CLARIFYING QUESTIONS FROM 
19:48:31 COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN, PLEASE.
>> Councilmember Salwan: I'M JUST READY TO MAKE THE MOTION WHEN THE TIME 
19:48:35 IS RIGHT.
>> Mayor Mei: WE STILL HAVE THE PUBLIC HEARING, SO I HAVE TO OPEN THAT FOR 
19:48:38 PUBLIC HEARING.
COUNCILMEMBER KENG, DO YOU HAVE A CLARIFYING QUESTION?

19:48:42 >> Councilmember Keng: YES, THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR.
I'M WONDERING IF YOU COULD SHARE WITH 
19:48:52 US, MAYBE TERRY, IF YOU HAVE AN APPROXIMATE COST THAT YOU GUYS HAD TO SPEND ON THE REHABILITATION OF THE 
19:49:04 HISTORIC HOUSE, AND ALSO IF YOU HAVE ANY PLANS FOR ITS USE MOVING  FORWARD.

19:49:13 >> I MEAN, FROM A COST PERSPECTIVE, I MEAN, YOU KNOW, MARK ENJOYS THESE TYPES OF PROJECTS AND TAKES PRIDE IN 
19:49:22 THE RESULTS AND IN MAKING SURE THAT IT'S DONE RIGHT.
I DON'T HAVE A NUMBER FOR YOU, BUT YOU 
19:49:28 KNOW, MARK MAY WANT TO SPEAK TO THAT OR NOT.
BUT FROM THE STANDPOINT WE'RE PLANNING 
19:49:37 ON SELLING THE HOUSE AND IT BASICALLY RESTORED AND REHABILITATED SO THAT A FAMILY, YOU KNOW, FROM TODAY'S 
19:49:48 STANDARDS WILL BE ABLE TO LIVE IN IT AND RAISE THEIR FAMILY IN IT.
>> Councilmember Keng: GREAT.

19:49:52 THANK YOU SO MUCH.
>> Councilmember Cox: MAY I ASK A QUESTION?

19:49:55 >> Mayor Mei: SORRY, I DON'T SEE YOUR HAND RAISED.
YES, COUNCILMEMBER COX.

19:50:03 >> Councilmember Cox: THANK YOU.
TERRY, I WOULD LIKE TO FIND OUT WITH THE SIGN THAT YOU JUST  SHOWED US, IS 
19:50:10 IT ONLY IN  ENGLISH, BECAUSE I THOUGHT THAT THERE'S SOME OTHER THINGS THAT SHOULD BE TRANSLATED INTO SOME OTHER 
19:50:22 LANGUAGES TO MAKE IT MORE LANGUAGE-ACCESSIBLE.
>> IT IS ONLY IN ENGLISH, AND IT'S 
19:50:34 LOCATED HERE PHYSICALLY.
IT'S ALSO AT -- THE DOCUMENTATION WAS SENT TO THE WASHINGTON TOWNSHIP MUSEUM 
19:50:40 OF LOCAL HISTORY.
THE FREMONT PUBLIC LIBRARY BRANCH, NORTHWEST INFORMATION CENTER FOR 
19:50:46 HISTORIC AND INFORMATION RESOURCES SONOMA STATE AND WITH THE FREMONT PLANNING DIVISION.

19:50:54 BUT IT IS NOT TRANSLATED INTO -- TO ANOTHER LANGUAGE, I GUESS THAT WASN'T PART OF THE CONDITIONS BUT I'M SURE 
19:51:04 THAT'S SOMETHING THAT CAN BE DONE AND PLACED WITH THOSE -- THE RESOURCES WITH -- IN THOSE PLACES WHERE IT IS 
19:51:09 BEING STORED.
>> Councilmember Cox: THAT WOULD BE A BIG HELP, ESPECIALLY WITH THE ADA AND 
19:51:17 MAKING SURE THAT THERE'S ALSO SOME ACCOMMODATIONS THAT EVERYONE WOULD BE ABLE TO READ ABOUT THE WONDERFUL 
19:51:26 HISTORY AND TO BE ABLE TO MAKE IT -- SINCE WE ARE A ASIAN-DOMINATED COMMUNITY, THAT IT WOULD BE WONDERFUL 
19:51:33 TO CONSIDER SOME OTHER LANGUAGES, THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO BE ABLE TO SHARE THIS  HISTORY.

19:51:43 >> Mayor Mei: OKAY.
SEEING NO OTHER ADDITIONAL COMMENTS AT THIS TIME, I'D LIKE TO OPEN UP THE 
19:51:48 PUBLIC HEARING.
AND I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S ANY SPEAKERS WOULD WHO WOULD LIKE  TO -- I 
19:51:54 SEE AN ATTENDEE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK.
DAVID SISSAN.

19:52:03 IF YOU COULD UNMUTE YOUR MIC, PLEASE.
>> MY NAME IS DAVID SISSON.
I OWN THE PROPERTY NEXT TO THE 
19:52:10 FARMHOUSE, I SAW THE HOUSE THROUGH THE ENTIRE RESTORATION PROCESS.
THE TIME OF THIS PROPOSAL SEEMS RATHER 
19:52:15 CONVENIENT.
THREE YEARS AGO THE -- TO MAKE IT HISTORIC BECAUSE THEY REALLY WANTED TO 
19:52:19 MAKE -- AND NOW THEY'RE DEKRAIRING IT HISTORIC JUST BECAUSE THEY WANT TO PUT IT UP FOR SALE.

19:52:27 IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IT'S A LITTLE TOO LATE.
IF YOU LOOK AT THE AS-BUILT PLANS, 
19:52:35 CONSIDERABLE EFFORT FOR REPLACE -- THE HOUSE IS NOT -- THE INTERIOR WAS GUTTED TO REMOVE THE DISTINCTIVE 
19:52:42 FEATURES SUCH AS THE CHILDREN'S BEDROOMS WITH VERY QUAINT SMALL ROOMS THAT THEY WOULD PUT THE CHILDREN IN, 
19:52:50 NOT SOMETHING WE WOULD DO TODAY, BUT THAT'S WHAT IS THERE, AND -- ENTIRE -- OF THE HOUSE.

19:53:02 WHEN WE DISCUSSED AT THE HARB MEETING BACK IN 2018, IT WAS DECIDED REMOVING THE BACK OF THE HOUSE WOULD MAKE IT -- 
19:53:10  IN CASE THEY WANT TO MAKE IT HISTORIC.
THEY CHANGED WHAT THEY WANTED TO DO.

19:53:19 ONE OF THE THINGS I THINK REALLY THE SAME ABOUT THE HOUSE, THE FRONT PROFILE LOOKS ABOUT THE SAME AND SOME 
19:53:29 SUPPORT BEAMS.
BACK IN -- THE ONLY THING THAT'S REALLY HISTORIC ABOUT THIS THING IS 
19:53:35 THE PATH, THEY PUT A GARAGE AND FENCE ACROSS THE PATH AND IT'S NOT EVEN LISTED ON THE HISTORIC RESOURCES IF 
19:53:42 THEY WANT TO PRESERVE IT TODAY SO THIS COMPLETE CHANGE BASICALLY ONCE AGAIN, THEY'RE TRYING TO MANIPULATE THE 
19:53:52 SYSTEM IN ORDER TO GAIN SOME PROFIT.
WE SHOULD -- GAIN THE SYSTEM FOR FINANCIAL PURPOSES, AND WE SHOULDN'T 
19:53:56 DECLARE SOMETHING AS HISTORIC WHEN IT OBVIOUSLY NO LONGER IS.
THE FARMHOUSE NEEDS TO BE REMOVED FROM 
19:54:03 THE PUZZLE.
THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: NEXT SPEAKER IS KELLY 
19:54:13 ABREU.
WELCOME.
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, FROM MY 
19:54:22 PERSPECTIVE, IF WE'RE GOING TO BE DEMANDING HISTORICAL  ACCURACY, I WOULD GO BACK A HUNDRED YEARS AND TALK 
19:54:29 TO SENIOR RODRIGUES AND TELL HIM HE'S NOT BUILDING IN HIS HISTORICAL TRADITION BACK FROM BACK WHERE HE CAME 
19:54:36 FROM.
HE'S ADOPTING A WHOLE NEW STYLE, AND CHANGING THE APPEARANCE OF HIS 
19:54:48 CONSTRUCTION TO FIT A NEW ENVIRONMENT, AND THEN AS GENERATIONS OR AS DECADES GO BY, HIS NEEDS CHANGE, HE'S GOING IN 
19:55:01 AND CHANGING THE HOUSE AND ADDING ON AND DOING A LOT OF THINGS.
THE HOUSE IS CERTAINLY NOT AT ALL 
19:55:07 ECONOMIC IN TERMS OF ANYBODY WHO'S BUILDING A HOUSE LIKE THAT IS GOING TO END UP BUILDING A HOUSE -- OR BUILDING 
19:55:11 A HOUSE IN THAT NEIGHBORHOOD IS GOING TO END UP BUILDING A HOUSE LIKE THE HOUSES NEXT DOOR TO IT.

19:55:24 THOSE 55 NEW HOUSES.
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO GO IN AND PLAY AROUND WITH OLD WOOD AND TRY TO MAKE 
19:55:30 SOMETHING THAT MAINTAINS AN OLD APPEARANCE FOR THE SAKE OF THE HISTORICAL ARCHITECTURE, BUT THEY DID, 
19:55:35 AND THEY SPENT A LOT OF MONEY DOING IT, NOW THEY'RE LOOKING FOR ALL THE TAX BREAKS THEY CAN GET.

19:55:48 YOU KNOW, I'VE SEEN -- THAT'S ENTIRELY TO BE EXPECTED.
AND AS FAR AS THE LANGUAGE TRANSLATION 
19:56:01 THERE, YOU KNOW, AS I THINK THAT THE FAMILY WOULD EXPECT TO BE ABLE TO READ THAT IN THEIR LANGUAGE, ALONG WITH 
19:56:09 MAYBE SOME OF THE LOCAL  LANGUAGES HERE, ENGLISH, WHATEVER.
AND THAT COULD BE DONE, THAT LANGUAGE 
19:56:16 IS -- THERE ARE PEOPLE STILL AROUND WHO CAN -- WHO KNOW THAT LANGUAGE.
YOU KNOW, JUST AUTOMATICALLY GOING TO 
19:56:23 WHATEVER IS MOST POPULAR NOW, LET'S STICK WITH THE HISTORICAL LANGUAGE IF WE WANT TO STICK WITH HISTORICAL -- 
19:56:29 ALL THE HISTORICAL DETAILS, INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR, THAT IS NOT IN THE RULES, BY THE WAY.

19:56:35 THE RULES SAY YOU MAINTAIN THE EXTERIOR APPEARANCE.
YOU ARE NOT REQUIRED TO RECONSTRUCT 
19:56:45 THE INTERIOR OF THESE THINGS AND KEEP DOING WHATEVER IT WAS THEY DID A HUNDRED YEARS AGO ON THE INTERIOR.

19:56:52 ANYWAY, THINK WE NEED TO APPRECIATE WHAT WE'VE GOT AND NOT NITPICK OVER FINE HISTORICAL DETAILS THAT WE'RE 
19:57:01 NEVER GOING TO REALISTICALLY ACHIEVE.
THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:57:12 SO SEEING NO OTHER PUBLIC SPEAKERS, I'M GOING TO TURN IT BACK TO THE COUNCIL.
I WAS GOING TO MAKE A GENERAL COMMENT 
19:57:19 IDEALLY IN THE FUTURE, WHEN WE LOOK THROUGH HOW WE DELIVER HISTORICAL BUILDINGS, IDEALLY SOME OF THESE SIGNS 
19:57:25 MUCH LIKE WE SEE IN OUR CITY, DOWNTOWN EVENT CENTER AND OTHERS I HOPE WILL BE DIGITAL, BECAUSE THAT WILL ALLOW US 
19:57:31 THE ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO CHOOSE THE LANGUAGES THAT WOULD BE ABLE TO BE ACCESSIBLE, BOTH HISTORICAL AND 
19:57:36 CURRENTLY IN THE PUBLIC.
AND WITH THE SCHOOL FOR THE DEAF AND THE SCHOOL FOR THE BLIND LOCALLY HERE, 
19:57:41 OF COURSE WE WOULD LOVE TO BE ABLE TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL ARE ABLE TO ENJOY AND UNDERSTAND THIS.

19:57:45 I'D LIKE TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM ANY OF MY FELLOW COUNCILMEMBERS.

19:57:49 COUNCILMEMBER KENG.
>> Councilmember Keng: THANK  YOU, MADAME MAYOR.

19:57:58 SO I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT I REALLY DO APPRECIATE MR. ROBSON KIND OF -- YOU GUYS WENT OUT OF YOUR WAY TO RESTORE 
19:58:09 THIS HISTORIC HOME, AND WE DON'T HAVE MANY -- TOO MANY OF THESE HOMES LEFT IN FREMONT, AND IT IS REALLY QUITE 
19:58:14 SIGNIFICANT THAT WE CAN RESTORE SOMETHING LIKE THIS THAT'S BEEN THERE FOR MORE THAN A HUNDRED 20 YEARS.

19:58:22 SO I JUST WANTED -- I THINK OFTENTIMES WE -- I WAS ASKING ABOUT THE COST BECAUSE I THINK OFTENTIMES, YOU KNOW, 
19:58:27 TO RESTORE A OLD HOME LIKE THAT, IT PROBABLY COSTS MORE THAN JUST TO BUILD A NEW ONE.

19:58:42 SO I APPRECIATE YOUR EFFORT AND THE TIME AND EVERYTHING THAT YOU PUT INTO IT, AND I BELIEVE OUR HARB, HISTORIC 
19:58:54 REVIEW COMMITTEE IN FREMONT, WE DO HAVE A PRETTY STRICT PROCESS AND ALREADY APPROVE FOR TO BE CONSIDERED A 
19:59:06 HISTORIC HOME, SO I THINK I TRUST THAT THEY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING OVER THERE AND -- BUILDINGS IN OUR CITY, SO 
19:59:11 JUST WANTED TO SHOW MY APPRECIATION.
THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:59:15 I ALSO WANTED TO NOTE THAT THE APPLICANT HAS A FIVE-MINUTE OPPORTUNITY FOR REBUTTAL, IF THERE'S 
19:59:26 ANYTHING THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO ADD.
>> JUST REGARDING THE HISTORIC RESTORATION PROCESS, IT WAS DONE ALL 
19:59:38 UNDER THE CITY'S PURVIEW WITH THE HISTORIC ARCHITECTS AND CONSULTANTS REVIEWING PRETTY MUCH ALL THE STEPS 
19:59:47 THAT WE HAD TO TAKE, AND MAKING RECOMMENDATIONS AND YOU CAN SEE THOSE IN THE INFORMATIONAL  ITEMS, AND KELLY 
19:59:57 ABREU IS CORRECT THAT IT IS THE EXTERIOR OF THE BUILDING THAT THE SECRETARY OF INTERIOR STANDARDS LOOKS 
20:00:07 AT IN TERMS OF THE RESTORATION.
THEY HAVE THE EXPECTATION THAT THE INTERIOR WILL NEED TO BE CHANGED OR 
20:00:16 MODIFIED.
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE, BUT RECOGNIZES THAT THAT MAY BE A POSSIBILITY, BUT 
20:00:26 FROM THE OUTSIDE, YOU WILL SEE WHAT THE RE-USE OF THE MATERIALS AND THE LOOK OF THE ORIGINAL.

20:00:36 MARK, DO YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO ADD?
>> WELL, I'D JUST ADD THAT THERE ARE LOTS OF HISTORIC BUILDINGS IN THE BAY 
20:00:45 AREA, THE FERRY BUILDING, FOR EXAMPLE, USED TO BE A FERRY DEPOT, IT'S NOW A RETAIL CENTER ON THE INSIDE BUT THEY 
20:00:53 RESTORED THE OUTSIDE.
SO ADAPTIVE RE-USE IS COMMON PRACTICE, AND FROM A HOUSING STANDPOINT, THE 
20:00:58 GOAL WAS TO DESIGN A HOME FOR MODERN LIVING ON THE INSIDE SO THAT PEOPLE WOULD MAINTAIN IT.

20:01:04 AND TAKE CARE OF IT FOR THE NEXT HUNDRED YEARS.
AND THAT'S IMPORTANT AND THAT'S WHAT 
20:01:15 WE TRIED TO DO.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
SEEING NO OTHER QUESTIONS AT THIS 
20:01:21 TIME, I'LL TURN IT OVER THEN TO OUR COUNCIL TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY OTHER FINAL COMMENTS.

20:01:31 I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SAY THAT WHERE POSSIBLE, IT IS HELPFUL, I DO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO WALK BY THAT PROPERTY 
20:01:38 AND TO READ THE SIGNS AND TO BE ABLE TO WALK AROUND THE PROPERTY AT DIFFERENT STAGES OF IT.

20:01:45 IT'S PART OF I GUESS MY OWN ACTIVATE FREMONT PROCESS, BUT I HAVE SEEN THAT, AND I'VE SEEN THE PERIOD OF IT, AS 
20:01:49 GOING THROUGH THE TRANSITION, AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO PRESERVE WHAT HISTORY WE DO HAVE AND I'M GLAD THAT 
20:01:59 WE WERE ABLE TO HAVE THE FAMILY GUIDANCE UPON THE PROCESS.
I THINK THAT THAT ADDS BETTER TO THE 
20:02:03 RICHNESS OF THE HERITAGE WE'RE WORKING ON.
I SEE OUR CITY ATTORNEY ALSO HAS HER 
20:02:08 HAND RAISED.
DEBRA, COULD YOU SHARE WITH  US --
>> Ms. Margolis: I JUST WANTED TO 
20:02:11 REMIND YOU, MAYOR, TO OFFICIALLY CLOSE THE PUBLIC  HEARING.
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY, THANK YOU.

20:02:17 THEN LET'S OFFICIALLY CLOSE -- WAIT, THERE'S SOMEBODY WHO'S RAISED THEIR HAND THERE.

20:02:23 WE ONLY HAVE ONE SPEAKER, BUT I THINK THAT --
>> Ms. Gauthier: THAT HAND HAD ALREADY 
20:02:24 --
>> Mayor Mei: THAT PERSON HAD ALREADY SPOKEN.

20:02:29 SO I APOLOGIZE, DAVID.
SO --
>> Ms. Gauthier: OH, SORRY.

20:02:37 >> Mayor Mei: WAS THERE ANOTHER SPEAKER?
>> Ms. Gauthier: NO, SORRY.

20:02:41 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
SO THE PUBLIC HEARING IS CLOSED NOW.
AND I WILL TURN IT BACK AGAIN TO THE 
20:02:47 COUNCIL FOR MAKING THEIR COMMENTS AT THIS TIME.
OR A MOTION, PLEASE, IF THERE'S NONE.

20:02:54 >> Councilmember Jones: I'LL MOVE TO APPROVE STAFF RECOMMENDATION.
>> Councilmember Cox: SECOND.

20:02:59 >> Mayor Mei: MOTION BY COUNCILMEMBER JONES, SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER COX.
ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE.

20:03:04 >> Ms. Gauthier: COUNCILMEMBER COX, AYE.
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN, AYE.

20:03:11 COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, AYE.
COUNCILMEMBER JONES, AYE.
COUNCILMEMBER KENG, AYE.

20:03:20 VICE PRESIDENT SHAO, AYE.
MAYOR MEI, AYE.
AND SO THIS PASSES UNANIMOUSLY OF ALL 
20:03:27 OF THE COUNCIL.
IN TERMS OF THIS ACTION TO PRESERVE AND REGISTER LISTING AND MILLS ACT 
20:03:34 CONTRACT FOR THE RODRIGUES FARMHOUSE.
I HOPE YOU CAN SHARE THAT WITH THE FAMILY TOO.

20:03:39 NEXT ON THE AGENDA THIS EVENING IS ITEM 5D, WHICH IS THE DOWNTOWN DISTRICT USE TABLE AMENDMENTS.

20:03:48 AND WE HAVE OUR DEPUTY CITY MANAGER, CHRISTINA BRIGGS, AND PLANNING MANAGER JOEL PULLEN WHO WILL PROVIDE US A 
20:03:54 PRESENTATION.
WELCOME.
>> THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR.

20:03:58 I BELIEVE JOEL IS GOING TO PULL UP A PRESENTATION SO JUST GIVE US ONE MOMENT.

20:04:05 >> Mayor Mei: SURE.
I WILL JUST MAKE A NOTE TO THE PUBLIC THAT DEPENDING ON THE TIMING OF THIS 
20:04:13 AND I THINK WE ARE GOING TO BE UP FOR A BREAK AROUND 8:30, IS THAT CORRECT?
SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE 
20:04:17 NOTE THAT.
BECAUSE WE HAVE STENOCAPTIONERS AND WE NEED TO PROVIDE THAT.

20:04:25 >> WE WILL SPEAK QUICKLY.
SO THANK YOU AGAIN, MADAME  MAYOR.
GOOD EVENING, MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL.

20:04:32 MY NAME IS CHRISTINA BRIGGS, CHECKVILLEMENT DIRECTOR.
TONIGHT WE'RE DISCUSSING SOME MINOR 
20:04:36 ZONING CHANGES IN THE DOWNTOWN WHICH REPRESENT A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT BETWEEN PLANNING AND ECONOMIC  
20:04:42 DEVELOPMENT TO MAINTAIN LEASING MOMENTUM IN OUR DOWNTOWN AND ALSO TO ADDRESS RETAIL MARKET CONDITIONS THAT 
20:04:50 HAVE EVOLVED SIGNIFICANTLY SINCE THIS ZONING WAS ORIGINALLY ESTABLISHED MANY YEARS AGO AND CONTINUES TO DO  SO.

20:04:58 WHILE THESE CHANGES IN RETAIL DEFINITELY PREDATE THE PANDEMIC, THE EFFECTS OF COVID-19 ARE NOW WOVEN 
20:05:02 THROUGH ALMOST EVERY TREND IN THE RETAIL INDUSTRY AND IN MOST CASES, ARE SPEEDING UP THESE CHANGES.

20:05:13 RETAIL ANALYSTS' FORECASTS CONTINUE DIFFICULTY OR EVEN BANKRUPTCIES FOR WHAT WE CALL SPECIALTY RETAIL, LIKE 
20:05:19 APPAREL AND SPECIALTY ITEMS, DEPENDENCE ON DIGITAL CHANNELS TO SELL PRODUCTS AND DECREASING THEIR DEMAND FOR 
20:05:25 PHYSICAL SPACE.
RESTAURANTS, ON THE OTHER HAND, ARE EXPECTING TO SLOWLY REBOUND, 
20:05:30 PARTICULARLY QUICK SERVICE RESTAURANTS, AND WE'RE SEEING SOME POSITIVE INDICATIONS OF THIS WITH THE FIRST TWO 
20:05:35 LEASES ON CAPITOL AVENUE GOING TO REALLY STRONG RESTAURANT  TENANTS.
HOWEVER, RESTAURANTS REALLY LIKE TO 
20:05:41 CO-LOCATE WITH A BROAD MIX OF USES THAT WILL GENERATE CUSTOMERS THROUGHOUT THE DAY AND EVENING, AND IN ADDITION, THEY 
20:05:46 WILL NOT BE SUCCESSFUL THEMSELVES IF THEY'RE SURROUNDED BY PERSISTENT VACANCY.

20:05:54 CURRENTLY, THE DOWNTOWN AREA HAS MORE RESTRICTIVE ZONING IN SOME CASES THAN OTHER ZONING IN PART OF FREMONT WITH 
20:06:01 MORE ESTABLISHED RESIDENTIAL BASES, ESSENTIALLY MAKING IT LESS COMPETITIVE FROM A RETAIL PERSPECTIVE.

20:06:06 IT ALSO HAS PROVISIONS THAT WE'RE ATTEMPTING TO CORRECT, I'LL SAY.
THIS INCLUDES RELEGATING CERTAIN USES 
20:06:13 TO THE UPPER FLOORS, IT CURRENTLY SAY, WHICH IS PROVING TO BE NOT A VIABLE SPACE FOR MOST TENANTS.

20:06:21 IT ALSO INTERESTING CURRENTLY REQUIRING A LENGTHY REVIEW PROCESS FOR DESIRABLE RESTAURANTS, WHICH REALLY STANDS IN 
20:06:25 CONFLICT WITH OUR VISION FOR THE DOWNTOWN.
AND SO WE'D LIKE TO REMEDY THAT.

20:06:32 SO GIVEN THIS, OUR GOAL IS TO PROVIDE A FRAMEWORK THAT IS NOT OVERLY DEPENDENT ON USES THAT CAN ONLY BE ABSORBED TO A 
20:06:37 CERTAIN DEGREE AND TO ALLOW FOR A MIX OF USES THAT ULTIMATELY STILL ACHIEVE THE PRIMARY GOAL OF DOWNTOWN, A PLACE 
20:06:44 THAT OFFERS A BROAD SPECTRUM OF CUSTOMER NEEDS AND THEREBY DRAWS MORE PEOPLE AND INCREASES ACTIVITY ON THE 
20:06:48 STREET.
WE TALK SO MUCH ABOUT ECONOMIC DIVERSITY IN FREMONT AS A SORT OF 
20:06:53 RESILIENCY AND WE REALLY BELIEVE THE SAME PRINCIPLE  APPLIES TO OUR DOWNTOWN RETAIL ENVIRONMENT.

20:07:00 BUT WE'RE VERY COGNIZANT OF THE DOWNTOWN VISION AND THAT'S PRECISELY BECAUSE WE'RE  BEGINNING TO SEE 
20:07:05 MOMENTUM THAT WE WANT TO SUPPORT IT WITH A MARKET-BASED RESPONSE.
SO WE BELIEVE WE'RE PROPOSING A 
20:07:10 BALANCED APPROACH HERE TONIGHT WITH A LIMITED CONCENTRATION CAP THAT WOULD APPLY TO JUST A SMALL GROUP OF USES 
20:07:16 THAT JOEL IS NOW GOING TO DESCRIBE FOR YOU.
>> THANK YOU, CHRISTINA, FOR THAT 
20:07:20 BROAD OVERVIEW.
I'M GOING TO GET INTO THE NUTS AND BOLTS OF THE AREA WE'RE TALKING ABOUT 
20:07:27 AND THE SPECIFICS OF THE EXISTING AND PROPOSED CHANGES.
SO AS CHRISTINA INDICATED, WE 
20:07:32 PERIODICALLY DO COME TO COUNCIL WITH CODE UPDATES TO RESPOND TO CHANGING CONDITIONS IN THE CITY.

20:07:38 THE GENERAL PLAN DIRECTS CITY STAFF TO PERIODICALLY REVIEW THOSE ZONING RULES AND CONSIDER ANY WARRANTED CHANGES.

20:07:48 SO THIS IS A MAP ON THE SCREEN OF OUR EMERGING DOWNTOWN.
AT THE CORE, THE CITY'S DOWNTOWN EVENT 
20:07:56 CENTER IN GREEN AT CAPITOL AND STATE IS COMING ALONG, LOCALE JUST WEST OF THAT PLAN SOUTH HERE IS BEGINNING TO SEE 
20:08:00 COMMERCIAL BUILDOUTS LIKE THE RESTAURANTS CHRISTINA MENTIONED.
THERE ARE APPROVED DEVELOPMENTS AT 
20:08:06 FREMONT BANK AND THE ADJACENT MIXED USE DEVELOPMENT CLOSER TO FREMONT BOULEVARD, AS WELL AS SOME MIXED USE 
20:08:17 PROPOSALS IN THE AREAS NEAR AND ACROSS FROM CITY HALL.
SO THAT'S JUST TO SAY, IN BASIC 
20:08:23 EXPLANATION, THERE'S A LOT OF INVESTMENT HAPPENING, AND USES ARE BEING ESTABLISHED, AND CONSIDERED AT 
20:08:33 THIS TIME.
I WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT'S BEING PROPOSED.

20:08:39 AS WE RESPOND TO WHAT WE CONSIDER VERY DYNAMIC MARKET CONDITIONS, OUR PRIMARY GOAL FOR AN URBAN AREA SUCH AS THIS 
20:08:45 AREA IS TO MAINTAIN A VIBRANCY AND A VITALITY OF AN ACTIVE  PEDESTRIAN-ORIENTED ENVIRONMENT.

20:08:52 SO WE'RE REDUCING THE REVIEW LEVEL FOR RESTAURANTS, FOR EXAMPLE, SO THEY CAN ESTABLISH THEMSELVES EASIER, AND ALSO 
20:09:00 MAINTAINING THE ALLOWANCE FOR RETAIL AND DRINKING PLACES, BUT ALSO GOING TO SOME OTHER USES TO FILL IN THE GAPS AS 
20:09:06 WE GROW.
FOR EXAMPLE, WE WERE RELATIVELY CAUTIOUS WITH OUR MIXED USE RULES WHEN 
20:09:10 WE ESTABLISHED THE DISTRICT A FEW YEARS AGO.
ONE OF THOSE EXAMPLES WOULD BE THAT 
20:09:16 OUTDOOR DINING WITH ALCOHOL PREVIOUSLY TRIGGERED A MINOR ENTITLEMENT.
AS DID ALCOHOL SERVICE WITH 
20:09:21 RESIDENTIAL ABOVE, FOR EXAMPLE.
THOSE ARE TWO THINGS WE'VE GOTTEN MORE USED TO WITH THE MORE RECENT EXPANSION 
20:09:28 OF OUTDOOR DINING, IN MIXED USE AREAS AND ELSEWHERE IN THE CITY.
WE ALSO NEED TO ENCOURAGE OCCUPANCY OF 
20:09:34 THE GROUND FLOOR TENANT SPACES TO HELP BUILD THAT MOMENTUM CHRISTINA DISCUSSED.

20:09:40 A HEALTHY MIX OF USES INCLUDES THOSE ACTIVE GROUND FLOOR USES BUT THERE ARE OTHER SYNERGISTIC USES THAT CAN BE 
20:09:45 PART OF THAT HEALTHY MIX.
SO AN EXAMPLE OF THAT MIGHT BE SOMEONE VISITING A FITNESS  CLASS, STOPPING 
20:09:51 OFF FOR A MEAL OR A SNACK BEFORE OR AFTER.
ANOTHER POSSIBILITY IS SOMEONE WITH A 
20:09:57 MEDICAL APPOINTMENT IN THOSE AREAS TAKING CARE OF AN ERRAND, MAYBE DROPPING OFF LAUNDRY OR SOME OTHER 
20:10:03 TYPE OF A SERVICE USE, AND SO THESE THINGS ARE SYNERGISTIC.
THEY ALLOW YOU TO DO MULTIPLE THINGS 
20:10:12 IN ONE TRIP, AND TO HAVE MULTIPLE REASONS TO VISIT A PLACE TO PATRONIZE THE MORE ACTIVE AND THE OTHER USES 
20:10:22 NECESSARY TO CREATE THAT HEALTHY MIX.
SO TO BE SPECIFIC ABOUT THE PROPOSED USE TABLE AMENDMENTS, THE USES LISTED 
20:10:30 HERE IN THE FIRST BULLET IN PARENTHESES ARE SOME OF THE TYPES OF USE, NOT ALL, THE FULL AMOUNTS IN THE REPORT AND IN 
20:10:41 THE TABLE THAT ARE PERMITTED IN MANY OTHER URBAN ENVIRONMENTS, REGIONALLY AND PLACES IN THE CITY SUCH AT OUR 
20:10:44 TOWN CENTERS.
ALONG WITH PROVIDING THE FLEXIBILITY AND THE USES TO ENCOURAGE LEASING 
20:10:51 ACTIVITY, PART OF STRIKING THAT BALANCE WAS TO SET A BAR WHERE THE MAJORITY OF USES WOULD ALWAYS BE THOSE RESTAURANT 
20:10:58 RETAIL DRINKING PLACES AND THOSE TYPE.
AGAIN, AT A MORE STREAMLINED LEVEL OF REVEUL FOR THE ONES I MENTIONED, FOR 
20:11:05 EXAMPLE.
WHILE WE MIGHT GET TO 100% OF RESTAURANTS AND RETAIL AS USES TURN 
20:11:11 OVER OVER TIME, WE WOULD NEVER HAVE MORE THAN 40% OF THE USES THAT ARE LISTED HERE AT THE LIMITED 
20:11:15 CONCENTRATION USES SHOWN IN THE TABLE AS L.
WE CONTINUE TO REQUIRE, OF COURSE, 
20:11:24 THAT URBAN DESIGN ELEMENTS SUCH AS THE BUILDING FORM YOU SEE HERE AND ON THE STREET ON CAPITOL IN TERMS OF SITE AND 
20:11:28 BUILDING AT THE SIGN AND ALSO STOREFRONT TRANSPARENCY THAT ATTRACT THE FOOT TRAFFIC AND PROVIDE A SENSE 
20:11:37 OF PLACE WHERE PEOPLE WANT TO BE.
LASTLY WE DO THINK THIS PROPOSAL IS THE RIGHT FIT BECAUSE IT PROVIDES A 
20:11:41 FRAMEWORK THAT'S FLEXIBLE BUT ENSURES THE DOWNTOWN GROWS INTO THE ACTIVE CORE WE ALL WANT TO BE.

20:11:47 WE'LL CONTINUE TO BRING YOU ITEMS LIKE THIS AS WE RECOGNIZE CHANGES IN RETAIL CONDITIONS THROUGHOUT THE CITY TO MAKE 
20:11:53 SURE THE CITY IS BOTH COMPETING WELL IN THE REGION AND PROVIDING THE BEST PLACES WITH THE BEST RANGE OF USES FOR 
20:12:00 OUR CITY.
THAT CONCLUDES OUR PRESENTATION AND WE'RE AVAILABLE FOR ANY QUESTIONS YOU 
20:12:04 MAY HAVE.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
AT THIS TIME, I'LL TURN TO OUR COUNCIL 
20:12:15 FOR ANY CLARIFYING QUESTIONS.
INTO SEEING NONE AT THIS TIME, I'LL TURN IT OVER TO OUR PUBLIC COMMENTS.

20:12:21 I BELIEVE WE HAVE A SPEAKER.
WELCOME, JOHN WEED.
>> THANK YOU.

20:12:31 I WAS SURPRISED TO READ IN THIS THAT THE CITY OF FREMONT HAD A ZONING CLASSIFICATION FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES 
20:12:39 AND THAT IT PROHIBITED -- THIS PLAN PROHIBITS COMMUNITY COLLEGES IN THE CC DISTRICT AND LIMITS IT ELSEWHERE.

20:12:46 I LOOKED INTO IT, THE CITY OF FREMONT HAS GREATLY RESTRICTED COMMUNITY COLLEGE USES.

20:12:54 IF YOU TYPE IN 46,000 MISSION BOULEVARD YOU'LL FIND -- COLLEGE CAMPUS -- NOT ALLOWED.

20:13:01 THAT DOESN'T IMPACT THE COLLEGE ITSELF BUT DOES IMPACT THE FRONTAGE PROPERTY WHICH IS SURPLUSSED AND NOW UNDER THE 
20:13:08 AUSPICES OF THE CITY ZONING.
I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO CONSIDER EDUCATION, WHICH HAS BEEN BANNED OR 
20:13:14 LIMITED IN A NUMBER OF COMMERCIAL DISTRICTS BECAUSE IT DOESN'T GENERATE A SALES TAX AS A PRIORITY.

20:13:23 IT'S PART OF THE VERY BASIS OF YOUR ECONOMIC INFRASTRUCTURE.
IT'S PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT TO SOME 
20:13:29 ETHNIC GROUPS AND THE REASON YOU HAVE THE LOWEST POVERTY RATE OF ANY CITY IN THE UNITED STATES IS BECAUSE OF 
20:13:34 EDUCATION AND THE HIGH EDUCATION OF THE COMMUNITY.
YOU HAVE TO CHANGE THAT MINDSET.

20:13:42 RELATED TO THE DOWNTOWN, YOU THE FUTURE OF THE DOWNTOWN FREMONT, CURRENT DOWNTOWN.

20:13:47 THERE WILL BE OTHERS LATER ON, PROBABLY ARDENWOOD, IS THAT OF ROCHESTER, MINNESOTA, HOME OF THE MAYO CLINIC.

20:13:52 THE PRIMARY INDUSTRY WILL BE HEALTHCARE.
THE GROUP LIVING THERE WILL BE THOSE 
20:14:00 IN NEED OF HEALTHCARE AND ASSISTED LIVING AND SENIOR HOUSING.
AND THAT IS YOUR FUTURE.

20:14:08 IT'S NOT A YOUNG VIBRANT COMMUNITY THAT WE SEE NOW WITH THE H1Bs THAT WILL BE MOVING CLOSER TO WHERE THOSE HIGH-TECH 
20:14:19 JOBS ARE OR BACK OVERSEAS.
SO AS YOU GO WITH THIS, I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO REVISIT THE COMMUNITY 
20:14:29 COLLEGE ZONING AND PARTICULARLY THE AREAS THAT ARE LIMITED, AND GIVE SOME THOUGHT TO WHAT THE REAL FUTURE IS TO 
20:14:39 A DOWNTOWN WHICH DOES NOT HAVE A MAJOR FREEWAY OR TRANSPORTATION CORRIDOR TO IT OR DOESN'T ACHIEVE THAT, ITS 
20:14:46 VEHICLE TRANSPORTATION.
AND I SUSPECT THAT THE CITY OWNS THE ARDENWOOD AREA AND AS JACK BROOKS HAS 
20:14:55 ONCE PROPOSED, THE REGION CURRENTLY A PARK IS ANOTHER WALNUT CREEK CENTER AND THAT WILL BE YOUR NEXT DOWNTOWN 
20:14:59 FOLLOWING THE WARM SPRINGS DEVELOPMENT.
I WISH YOU WELL, AND THANK YOU.

20:15:08 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
NEXT SPEAKER IS KELLY ABREU.
WELCOME.

20:15:20 >> I AM HIGHLY SKEPTICAL OF THE SIREN CALL OF DIVERSIFICATION, THE LIMITS ON OVERCONCENTRATION, AND THE GOVERNMENT 
20:15:28 BUREAUCRATS WHO WOULD TELL US WHAT KIND OF BUSINESSES DESERVE TO SUCCEED -- DESERVE A PLACE IN OUR DOWNTOWN CORE.

20:15:35 I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE.
IF YOU START WALKING ON CIVIC CENTER DRIVE, WHICH I REALIZE IS OUTSIDE OF 
20:15:44 THIS PARTICULAR AREA, BUT IT'S NEARBY AND ECONOMICALLY AND PRACTICALLY AND PHYSICALLY IT'S A REPRESENTATIVE SITE 
20:15:52 OF WHAT IS DOWNTOWN FREMONT.
START WALKING FROM THE SOUTH END OF CIVIC CENTER DRIVE NEAR THE POLICE 
20:15:59 STATION AND START GOING NORTH WARDS ALONG THE SIDE OF THE ROAD, WHAT'S THE FIRST THING YOU RUN INTO, A GIANT 
20:16:01 EMPTY LOT.
PROBABLY UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE CITY.

20:16:10 WHAT IS ON THE EMPTY LOT NOW BEHIND ALL THE DECORATIVE CYCLONE FENCING AND ALL THE VISUAL BLOCKADES?

20:16:18 THERE ARE DOZENS OF EMPTY -- OF CARGO CONTAINERS, ALL OVER THE FLOOR OF THAT GROUND SPACE.

20:16:25 THESE CARGO CONTAINERS,  TRAILERS, YOU KNOW, THOSE RECTANGULAR METAL BOXES, SHIPPING CONTAINERS, EVERYWHERE.

20:16:32 YOU KNOW, THAT'S NOT AN ATTRACTIVE LOOK, BUT THAT'S WHAT THE CITY IS DOING WITH THE LAND THAT IT HAS 
20:16:39 AVAILABLE TO IT RIGHT NOW.
THEN WHAT'S THE NEXT THING YOU SEE?
WELL, THERE'S A WHOLE STRING -- 
20:16:44 THERE'S APARTMENT BUILDINGS WITH GROUND FLOOR RETAIL.
WHAT'S ON THAT GROUND FLOOR RETAIL?

20:16:51 WELL, THERE'S A LARGE NUMBER OF THEM, LIKE ABOUT HALF OF THEM OR SO, A LARGE PERCENTAGE ARE  EMPTY.

20:16:58 WHAT KIND OF EMPTINESS?
WELL, THERE'S A SANDWICH SHOP THAT CLOSED TWO YEARS AGO, THERE'S AN EMPTY 
20:17:06 REAL ESTATE OFFICE, THERE'S EMPTY SPACES OF I DON'T KNOW WHAT, AND THERE'S AN EMPTY COSMETIC PLASTIC 
20:17:15 SURGERY DOCTOR'S OFFICES THERE, MEDICAL BUSINESS FAILURE.
WHAT SURVIVED WAS A CLEANERS, A 
20:17:24 DENTIST'S OFFICE, A NAIL SALON, A HAIR SALON, AN EDUCATIONAL SERVICES SCHOOL FOR CHILDREN TRYING TO -- WHO WANT TO 
20:17:35 LEARN SOMETHING ABOUT CODING, A COFFEE SHOP, AND A LOCATION FOR, AGAIN, EDUCATIONAL SERVICES, THE KIND OF 
20:17:42 EDUCATIONAL SERVICES THAT WE'RE GOING TO DISCOURAGE, SOMETHING CALLED GENIUS KIDS ESTABLISHMENT.

20:17:47 I THINK FREMONT NEEDS TO SUPPORT ALL THESE EDUCATIONAL SERVICES IF PEOPLE WANT THEIR CHILDREN TO GO TO THESE 
20:17:57 THINGS, I'M ALL FOR IT.
AND THE CITY SHOULD ALSO  SUPPORT, YOU KNOW, DENTISTS AND NAIL SALONS AND 
20:18:04 COSMETIC SURGERY AND WHATEVER ELSE IS A REASONABLE BUSINESS TO OPERATE.
IT SHOULD DISCOURAGE ALL THE SHIPPING 
20:18:12 CONTAINERS AND, YOU KNOW, BUT WE NEED SOME KIND OF BUSINESSES, AND ALL THIS EMPTY STORES IS A BAD SIGN FOR THE 
20:18:19 FUTURE OF THE DOWNTOWN.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
AND AT THIS TIME, I'LL TURN IT BACK 
20:18:26 OVER TO OUR COUNCILMEMBERS, I'M GOING TO CLOSE THE PUBLIC HEARING AND I WILL THEN ALSO BRING IT BACK TO THE COUNCIL 
20:18:31 FOR CLARIFYING QUESTIONS BEGINNING WITH COUNCILMEMBER KENG.
>> Councilmember Keng: THANK YOU, 
20:18:38 MADAME MAYOR.
I DO WANT TO ASK THE STAFF, YOU KNOW, IF WE HAVE ANY STRATEGIES OR 
20:18:49 INCENTIVES, PROGRAMS, THAT WILL ATTRACT, YOU KNOW, BUSINESSES AND RETAIL STORES TO THIS AREA, IF WE WANT 
20:18:56 TO BUILD A THRIVING, LIVELY KIND OF AN ATMOSPHERE, AS YOU KNOW THAT RETAIL STORES ARE GETTING MORE AND MORE 
20:19:06 EXPENSIVE TO OPERATE, AND PEOPLE ARE SHOPPING ONLINE, AND YOU KNOW, THE NEW BUILDS LIKE THIS IS GOING TO -- YOU 
20:19:20 KNOW, THE RENT IS GOING TO BE VERY HIGH.
SO WHAT ARE WE DOING TO  ATTRACT --

20:19:24 >> THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION, COUNCILMEMBER KENG.
I WOULD SAY THE MOST IMPORTANT 
20:19:32 INCENTIVE THAT WE AS A CITY CAN PROVIDE TO ATTRACT RETAIL IS TO PROVIDE A VARIETY OF CUSTOMER BASES, SO THE 
20:19:37 RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT THAT'S OCCURRING IN DOWNTOWN, FOR EXAMPLE, IS, YOU KNOW, SOMETHING THAT MOST OF 
20:19:45 THE RETAIL TENANTS WE TALK TO, TOP OF MIND FOR THEM, UNDERSTANDING WHAT THE PROGRESS IS, HOW MANY UNITS ARE COMING 
20:19:50 ONLINE, BECAUSE THOSE REPRESENT CUSTOMERS.
AND THEN FURTHER KIND OF ARTICULATING 
20:19:57 THE OTHER TYPE OF DAY TIME POPULATION THAT EXISTS IN THE DOWNTOWN WITH THE MEDICAL AND HOSPITAL COMMUNITY.

20:20:05 SO REALLY, THAT IS PROBABLY THE NUMBER ONE QUESTION WE GET ASKED WHEN WE HEAR FROM RETAIL PROSPECTS.

20:20:13 AND THEN BEYOND THAT, THE PROBABLY SECOND MOST IMPORTANT INCENTIVE IS SOMETHING WE ALREADY DO A FAIRLY GOOD 
20:20:19 JOB WITH THE HELP OF PLANNING BUT WE'RE ATTEMPTING TO EVEN MAKE THIS EASIER TONIGHT, WHICH IS TO LIMIT WHAT WE 
20:20:27 CALL LIMIT THE RED TAPE, RIGHT, LIMIT THE LENGTH OF PROCESS, THE COSTS THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE TO INCUR TO GO INTO A 
20:20:34 SPACE, CONSTRUCTION, DESPITE THE PANDEMIC, CONSTRUCTION COSTS ARE STILL VERY EXPENSIVE FOR ANY TENANT DOING 
20:20:40 IMPROVEMENTS IN A SPACE, SO WHERE WE CAN MINIMIZE OTHER AREAS OF THAT BURDEN, WE REALLY LOOK FOR THOSE 
20:20:46 OPPORTUNITIES.
AND SO THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF THAT TONIGHT, FOR EXAMPLE, REDUCING THE 
20:20:57 ENTITLEMENT PROCESS FOR THESE RESTAURANTS THAT WE'RE PROPOSING.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

20:21:04 ARE THERE ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS REGARDING THE AMENDMENTS?
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN?

20:21:10 >> Councilmember Salwan: I DON'T HAVE ANY QUESTIONS BUT IS IT OKAY TO GO AHEAD TO COMMENTS?

20:21:11 >> Mayor Mei: SURE.
THAT WOULD BE GREAT.
THANK YOU.

20:21:15 >> Councilmember Salwan: WELL, THANK YOU.
WELL, I REALLY WANT TO THANK STAFF FOR 
20:21:22 PUTTING THE EFFORT INTO LOOKING AT THIS AREA.
IT'S A VERY CRUCIAL AREA FOR OUR 
20:21:28 COMMUNITY, AND ESPECIALLY THE PART WHERE IT ALLOWS MORE RESTAURANTS TO OPEN WITHOUT A LOT OF RED TAPE, SO 
20:21:38 THAT'S FANTASTIC.
THE PART I STRUGGLE WITH IS  OPENING UP THE USES FOR MORE KINDS OF USES.

20:21:46 I REALIZE THAT'S WHAT THE MARKET IS ASKING FOR, BUT THIS IS DEFINITELY A CATALYST PART OF OUR CITY.

20:21:55 AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE DID EARLY ON WAS WE SOLD IT AT A VERY ATTRACTIVE PRICE SO THAT THE DEVELOPER COULD HAVE 
20:22:03 THIS PROJECT ON FREMONT BOULEVARD AND CAPITOL AVENUE, AND THE CITY EXPENDED A LOT OF FUNDING TO MAKE IT HAPPEN.

20:22:12 WE GAVE THE LOT AT A MUCH SUBSIDIZED RATE SO THEY COULD HAVE RETAIL, WHICH AT THAT TIME THEY WERE ALSO SAYING WAS 
20:22:21 NOT -- OUT.
SO I GUESS MY CONCERN IS IF WE MAKE IT 40% OFFICE USE, MEDICAL USE AND 
20:22:25 OTHERS, THEN THIS AREA WILL BECOME LIKE ALL THE OTHER AREAS WE HAVE ALL OVER FREMONT.

20:22:33 SO WE ALREADY HAVE A LOT OF  THAT.
SO I MEAN, IF THERE'S ONE PLACE THAT WE CAN DO PLACE-MAKING OR TO HAVE A 
20:22:38 NICE ENVIRONMENT TO HAVE MORE ENTERTAINMENT, TO HAVE MORE NIGHTLIFE, I THINK THIS IS THE SPOT THAT WE CAN 
20:22:48 MAKE IT HAPPEN.
AND SO MY CONCERN IS IF WE TAKE A SHORT-TERM VIEW THAT SOME OF THESE 
20:22:54 MEDICAL OFFICES WILL COME AND OTHER OFFICE USES, EDUCATION PLACES, WHICH ARE GREAT, WE NEED THEM, BUT IF WE 
20:22:59 MAKE IT EASIER FOR THEM TO COME TO DOWNTOWN, THAT WILL TAKE AWAY FROM WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO CREATE HERE.

20:23:05 AND WE'LL HAVE ANOTHER COMPLEX, LIKE WE HAVE A CIVIC CENTER, LIKE WE HAVE AN ARTIST'S WALK LIKE WE HAVE ALL OVER 
20:23:11 THE CITY.
SO I THINK AT LEAST FOR THE PART THAT IS NEAR FREMONT BOULEVARD AND CAPITOL 
20:23:18 AVENUE, I THINK WE CAN HOLD THE LINE, MAYBE GIVE IT A LITTLE MORE TIME TO SEE IF WE CAN GET SOME MORE VIBRANT 
20:23:27  PLACES, AND I'M OPEN TO SOME COMPROMISE WHERE TOWARDS THE PASEO PADRE SIDE WE CAN ALLOW SOME OF THE 
20:23:34 EXISTING USES, WHETHER IT'S THE MERKEL PLAZA OR THE SPA BUILDING OR I CAN'T REMEMBER THE EXACT NAME BUT THE BROWN 
20:23:40 BUILDING.
BUT THE NEWER MORE FACING FREMONT BOULEVARD, I WOULD LIKE TO SEE US HOLD 
20:23:45 THE LINE ON THIS.
AND I KNOW THERE'S A STRUGGLE BECAUSE I KNOW EVEN EMERYVILLE, THEY CREATED 
20:23:50 ALL THESE BEAUTIFUL RETAIL PLACES, BUT THEY WEREN'T ABLE TO FILL THEM, SO THEY  FINALLY HAD TO GIVE IN.

20:23:56 SO I THINK WE CAN DEFINITELY GIVE A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME, IT'S STILL EARLY, I WOULD LIKE TO SEE SOME 
20:24:03 INCENTIVES TO SEE HOW WE CAN ENCOURAGE MORE RETAIL OR DESIRABLE RESTAURANTS TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR THEM TO OPEN, 
20:24:12 EVEN IF WE HAVE TO GIVE GRANTS OR LOANS THAT THEY PAY BACK OVER TIME OR I KNOW THEY HAVE TO BUILD THESE FOR THE TRASH 
20:24:22 -- THE GREASE TRAPS, WHICH ARE VERY EXPENSIVE.
BUT I THINK IF WE ALLOW MORE OFFICES, 
20:24:31 MORE MEDICAL USES FOREVER, THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE.
THE BAD THING IS I WENT TO SANTANA ROW 
20:24:37 THIS WEEKEND AND I THOUGHT WHY CAN'T WE HAVE JUST A SMALL PART, IT WON'T BE SANTANA ROW BUT IT WILL BE OUR OWN 
20:24:41 UNIQUE FLAVOR.
SO I THINK WE HAVE TO INCENTIVIZE AND CREATE SOMETHING HERE BECAUSE IF WE 
20:24:47 DON'T MAKE IT EASIER, I THINK IT WILL BE FOREVER ANOTHER HODGEPODGE STRIP CENTER THAT WE HAVE ALL OVER OUR 
20:24:52 CITY.
SO I JUST WANTED TO THROW THAT OUT THERE FOR FEEDBACK, AND COMMENTS FROM 
20:24:59 MY FELLOW COUNCILMEMBERS AS WELL AS STAFF TO SEE WHAT YOU GUYS THINK.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU, COUNCILMEMBER 
20:25:01 SALWAN.
I JUST WANTED TO JOIN YOU IN THAT COMMENT.

20:25:10 I THINK THAT WHEN WE LOOK AT WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO ESTABLISH IN OUR CITY A PLACE, I WOULD ALSO WANT TO GIVE US A 
20:25:15 LITTLE BIT MORE TIME, PART OF IT RIGHT NOW IS OUR DOWNTOWN EVENT CENTER, AND I THINK THAT PERHAPS THE DYNAMICS WILL 
20:25:25 BE MORE REVITALIZED AND ALSO SPURRED BY SOME OF THE ADDITIONS.
I KNOW ASF IS COMING BUT SLIVER PIZZA 
20:25:30 ACROSS FROM OUR DOWNTOWN EVENT CENTER.
ONE OF THE THINGS WE DID TRY TO ESTABLISH PRE-PANDEMIC WAS THAT SENSE 
20:25:38 OF PLACEMAKING, WHEN WE HAD OUR OUTDOOR SPACE AND WE HAD THE STREET EATS AND OTHER EVENT THAT WERE THERE TO TRY TO 
20:25:46 DRAW THE COMMUNITY THERE, AND CERTAINLY WHEN WE DID THAT GROUND BREAKING, WHAT SEEMS LIKE SO LONG AGO NOW IN 2019, IT 
20:25:54 REALLY DID HELP THAT WE CLOSED DOWN THE STREET, WE HAD ALL THE PEOPLE OUT THERE AND IT REALLY BROUGHT PEOPLE 
20:25:59 TOGETHER IN A WONDERFUL WAY TO CELEBRATE, AND THAT'S ONE OF MY FONDEST  MEMORIES WHEN I LOOK BACK 
20:26:05  PRE-PANDEMIC.
AS WE OPEN OUR DOWNTOWN EVENT CENTER AND AS WE SLOWLY ARE ABLE TO GATHER 
20:26:12 AGAIN, I THINK THAT HAVING THAT SPACE MAY BE AN OPPORTUNITY THAT WE DON'T WANT TO MISS IN CREATING THAT AND 
20:26:20 GENERATING.
I ABSOLUTELY ECHO SOME OF THESE SENTIMENTS IN TRYING TO DRAW 
20:26:31 ADDITIONAL RESTAURANTS TO FREMONT.
I THINK WHAT MAKES US WONDERFUL IS THE CULTURE AND I CERTAINLY AM A BIG 
20:26:38 PROPONENT FOR FOOD, COMING FROM PHILADELPHIA, I HAVE A LOT OF IRISH PUBS WHERE I GROUP UP, GREEK AND EYE 
20:26:41  ITALIAN, I WOULD WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY TO SIMULATE SOME MORE OF THAT.

20:26:46 SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE OTHER COUNCILMEMBERS SPEAK ON THAT.
COUNCILMEMBER JONES.

20:26:50 >> Councilmember Jones: THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR.
I WAS JUST GOING TO ECHO COUNCILMEMBER 
20:26:56 SALWAN'S COMMENTS AS WELL.
YOU KNOW, WHILE I UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S VERY POPULAR TO HAVE EDUCATIONAL SITE 
20:27:03 OR EVEN  MEDICAL, WE DO HAVE A LOT OF THOSE AND CASE IN POINT, WE HAVE A LOT OF EMPTY SPACES OVER ON CIVIC CENTER 
20:27:07 DRIVE.
SO I MEAN, IF YOU WANT TO CONCENTRATE SOME OF THE EDUCATIONAL PLACES THERE, 
20:27:16 THAT'S FINE.
I DON'T CJIS BASED ON WHAT'S BEING BUILT IN THE DOWNTOWN  AREA, I DON'T 
20:27:24 SEE A LOT OF -- QUITE FRANKLY A LOT OF CHILDREN PROBABLY LIVING THERE.
I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE MORE ADULTS, 
20:27:33 YOUNG ADULTS, THAT KIND OF THING THAT ARE OCCUPYING THOSE UNITS, AND THEY'RE GOING TO BE WANTING HOPEFULLY SOME 
20:27:37 TYPE OF NIGHTLIFE.
THAT'S BEEN A COMPLAINT FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS IN FREMONT, IS WHERE 
20:27:43 DO YOU GO IF YOU'RE OVER 21 OR IF YOU'RE BETWEEN 18 AND 21, WHERE TO YOU GO FOR ENTERTAINMENT IN FREMONT?

20:27:50 WE HAVE LOST A LOT OF PLACES, GRANTED SOME OF THEM WEREN'T THE MOST GLAMOROUS PLACES IN THE WORLD BUT THEY 
20:27:53 WERE PLACES FOR OUR YOUNG PEOPLE TO GO.
SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE KIND 
20:28:04 OF KEEP SOME OF THESE SPACES AVAILABLE FOR THOSE TYPES OF USES IF WE CAN ATTRACT THAT TYPE OF BUSINESS.

20:28:12 YOU KNOW, I KNOW WE HAVE A LOT OF MEDICAL BUILDINGS, AND WITH THE AMOUNT OF MEDICAL OFFICES THAT WE HAVE, I 
20:28:18 DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO BE CRUCIAL THAT WE ALLOW MEDICAL OFFICES ON THE FIRST FLOOR OF SOME OF THESE NEW 
20:28:24 DEVELOPMENTS.
I THINK IT WOULD REALLY BE MUCH MORE PRODUCTIVE FOR US TO HAVE EITHER 
20:28:32 RESTAURANTS OR SOME TYPE OF GAMING PLACE OR SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO ATTRACT A DIFFERENT DEMOGRAPHIC THAN 
20:28:36 WHAT WE HAVE NOW.
MOST OF OUR YOUNG PEOPLE GO OUT OF TOWN WHEN THEY WANT TO GO OUT AND HAVE 
20:28:40 A DATE OR DO WHATEVER IT IS THEY'RE GOING TO DO.
SO WE NEED TO BRING THAT BACK INTO 
20:28:44 FREMONT I THINK, AND IF WE'RE BUILDING THE CORE OF THE DOWNTOWN, NOW IS OUR OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT.

20:28:53 >> Mayor Mei: MAYBE AN E SPORTS BAR OR SOMETHING ALONG THAT  LINE, SOMETHING UNIQUELY  FREMONT.

20:29:01 I'M LOOKING FOR COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN AGAIN.
>> Councilmember Salwan: SO I THINK 
20:29:08  THAT CAPITOL AVENUE IS A KEY AREA, SO THAT OUT OF THE THREE ZONES, LET ME PULL IT UP AGAIN, SO YOU HAVE THE 
20:29:13 CAPITOL AVENUE ZONE, THE EDGE ZONE AND THE MID DISTRICT ZONES.
I'M OKAY WITH THE OTHER AREAS.

20:29:19 IT'S JUST THE CAPITOL AVENUE ZONE THAT I THINK WE NEED TO PROTECT.
AND I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO SEE MAYBE IF 
20:29:25 YOU CLOSE DOWN THE STREET, I MEAN, IF THAT -- MAYBE PERMANENTLY, I THINK THAT WOULD DEFINITELY HELP THOSE 
20:29:31 RESTAURANTS AND THOSE PLACES TO HAVE OUTDOOR DINING OR ENTERTAINMENT OR MUSIC OR DRINKING OR WHATEVER.

20:29:39 YOU KNOW, BUT I THINK WE SHOULD LOOK AT SOME OF THOSE OPPORTUNITIES TO MAKE FREMONT MORE EXCITING AND MORE 
20:29:49 ENTERTAINING AND GIVE PEOPLE A PLACE TO GO TO.
SO I REALLY THINK WE SHOULD DO WHAT WE 
20:29:54 CAN TO PRESERVE THAT AREA.
AGAIN, I'M OPEN TO CONSIDERATION TO ALL OF YOU, WHAT YOU GUYS THINK HOW WE 
20:30:03 CAN BALANCE THAT.
>> Mayor Mei: COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN.
>> Councilmember Kassan: THANK YOU.

20:30:15 SO I WAS VERY CONCERNED WHEN IT WAS ALLOWING ANY MEDICAL USE AT ALL, ANY NON-VIBRANT USE AT ALL WITH NO 
20:30:23 LIMITATION, AND I WAS REALLY HAPPY TO SEE STAFF COME BACK WITH THIS PROPOSAL, I ACTUALLY DO THINK THIS IS 
20:30:29 REASONABLE.
I AM NERVOUS ABOUT ALLOWING  NON-VIBRANT USES LIKE MEDICAL OFFICES, 
20:30:37 BUT ON THE OTHER HAND, I ALSO DO UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S CHALLENGING TO FILL SPACES IN AN AREA THAT'S NOT 
20:30:46 CURRENTLY VERY VIBRANT, SO I FEEL LIKE THIS IS A PRETTY GOOD COMPROMISE.
SO I ACTUALLY -- I DO SUPPORT THIS, 
20:30:53 EVEN THOUGH I AM NERVOUS ABOUT WHAT IT COULD LOOK LIKE, I HAVE WORKED ON PROJECTS BEFORE WHERE WE PUT USES IN 
20:31:04 THAT WERE NOT EXCITING AND WERE NOT ATTRACTIVE, AND IT REALLY HURT THE OVERALL FEEL OF THE AREA FOR YEARS AND 
20:31:08 YEARS TO COME, BUT I THINK 40% IS A PRETTY REASONABLE COMPROMISE, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE WE DO HAVE 
20:31:15 RESIDENTS WHO DO NEED DOCTOR'S OFFICES, THEY DO NEED PLACES TO DO THEIR LAUNDRY.

20:31:26 SO I'M WILLING TO SUPPORT THIS AS A COMPROMISE.
>> Mayor Mei: COUNCILMEMBER COX.

20:31:35 >> Councilmember Cox: THANK YOU.
I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE THINGS A LITTLE DIFFERENT FOR WHAT WE HAVE IN 
20:31:42 DOWNTOWN, AND I DO BELIEVE WHERE WE HAVE THE FUTURE DOWNTOWN EVENT CENTER, WE NEED TO HAVE THINGS THAT KIND OF 
20:31:52 SUPPORT THAT AREA, BUT SOMETHING UNIQUE THAT KIND OF ADDS THAT, I AGREE, I GO TO SANTANA ROW ALL THE TIME.

20:32:00 THAT'S WHERE I HAVE TO WORK, UNFORTUNATELY, BUT IT'S SOMEWHERE WHERE WE COULD KIND OF CREATE SOME 
20:32:13 SORT OF AMBIANCE THAT HAS A LITTLE MORE LIVELY FEEL TO THE CITY AND BE ABLE  TO -- WE ALL WANT TO LIVE, WORK, PLAY, 
20:32:26 SHOP, HAVE FUN, HERE IN FREMONT, AND MAYBE WHAT THE HELP OF CHRISTINA AND THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT WITH TINA 
20:32:32 KAPUR AND TEAM, THE WHOLE ENTIRE ECONOMIC DEVELOP M, MAYBE THERE'S SOME OTHER THOUGHTS THAT THEY CAN TAKE A 
20:32:42 LOOK AT AND SEE BECAUSE RIGHT NOW WE'RE COMING OUT OF THE PANDEMIC AND A LOT OF THINGS MAY HAVE TO BE RESET BECAUSE 
20:32:50 WHAT WE THOUGHT MIGHT HAVE BEEN ONE WAY A YEAR AND A HALF AGO, WE PROBABLY -- BECAUSE THIS IS GOING TO BE PERMANENT 
20:33:01 ONCE WE SET THIS ORDINANCE AND HOW EVERYTHING IS MAPPED OUT IN THIS TABLE TIED TO THE ORDINANCE THAT I THINK TO 
20:33:10 BE ABLE TO SEE IF THERE'S OTHER NEW TRENDS OR THINGS THAT HAVE OPENED UP THAT WE -- BECAUSE I CAN'T REMEMBER, 
20:33:17 I'VE ONLY BEEN HERE FOR SEVEN MONTHS AND WHATEVER VISIT WAS BEFORE THAT AND A YEAR AND A HALF OR TWO YEARS AGO, 
20:33:24 WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE MARK AND HOW THIS WAS PRESENTED, THAT WAS BACK THEN.
AND MAYBE TAKING A LOOK AND SEEING 
20:33:32 WHAT IS HAPPENING NOW, TO KIND OF CREATE A DIFFERENT UNIQUENESS, BECAUSE THIS IS KIND OF LIKE OUR MINIATURE 
20:33:40 CONVENTION CENTER, SO TO SPEAK, IN DOWNTOWN FREMONT, IN TERMS OF THIS ENTERTAINMENT AND SEEING WHETHER 
20:33:49 THINGS WOULD BE HELPFUL TO NOT ONLY GET MORE BOOKINGS AT THE DOWNTOWN EVENT CENTER BUT ALSO TO ATTRACT A LITTLE 
20:33:55 BIT MORE WIDE VARIETY OF SOME ENTERTAINMENT AND THINGS THAT YOU GO TO THE EVENT CENTER FOR ONE THING AND 
20:34:02 THEN MAYBE YOU WANT TO GO ACROSS THE STREET OR AROUND THE EDGE THERE FOR SOME OTHER TYPE OF -- BESIDES EATING 
20:34:10 BUT OTHER THINGS THAT COULD BE SOME SORT OF A MUSIC -- YOU  KNOW, SOME SORT OF MUSIC/EATING PLACE THAT WOULD 
20:34:18 HAVE MUSIC ATTACHED TO IT THAT WOULD MAKE IT MORE ENTERTAINING FOR THOSE TO HAVE A PART 1, PART 2 IN FREMONT.

20:34:24 SO JUST KIND OF -- I'M JUST BEING CAUTIOUS RIGHT NOW.
I APPRECIATE THE WORK BECAUSE YOU GUYS 
20:34:29 HAVE DONE A FINE JOB, BUT I WANT TO JUST STEP BACK FOR A MOMENT BECAUSE THINGS ARE KIND OF CHANGING PRETTY 
20:34:37 FAST SINCE THINGS HAVE OPENED SINCE JUNE THE 15TH, AND I REALLY THINK THAT WE SHOULD PROBABLY JUST TAKE ANOTHER 
20:34:44 LOOK, TAKE ANOTHER SAMPLING OF THINGS OUT THERE, AND I KNOW BEING THE FORMER CHAIR OF THE ECONOMIC  DEVELOPMENT 
20:34:55 COMMISSION AND WORKING WITH CHRISTINA AND OTHERS ON THE TEAM THERE, THAT THEY TEND TO BE VERY CREATIVE AND 
20:35:02 INNOVATIVE IN THEIR  THOUGHTS, AND SEE WHAT ELSE IS OUT THERE BEFORE WE COMMIT OURSELVES TO SOMETHING THAT 
20:35:09 WE'RE LOCKED IN FOR A VERY LONG TIME.
AND I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE MAKING THE RIGHT DECISIONS BASED 
20:35:17 ON NEW THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING THAT ARE PASSING PRETTY FAST HERE.
AND THERE'S NEW TRENDS AND NEW THINGS 
20:35:24 THAT ARE COMING OUT THAT WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO EVALUATE BEFORE MAKING THIS A FINAL ORDINANCE.

20:35:30 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
I JUST NOTED SOMETHING THAT I DIDN'T CLOSE THE PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD BUT I 
20:35:36 WANTED TO -- YOU SAW THERE'S ONE SPEAKER SO I'M GOING TO CALL ANDREW THOMAS AND THEN AFTER HIM, CLOSE THE 
20:35:38 PUBLIC COMMENT.
I APOLOGIZE I DIDN'T CLOSE IT EARLIER.

20:35:44 I DID CALL ON IT, BUT ANDREW, IF YOU COULD SPEAK, AND THEN I HAVE TWO COUNCIL MEMBERS AND WE'RE GOING TO 
20:35:46 CLOSE THIS ITEM THEN.
>> VERY GOOD.
CAN I HEAR ME?

20:35:53 >> Mayor Mei: I CAN.
>> HI, MY NAME IS DREW THOMAS.
I WORK FOR TMJ PARTNERS AND I DO 
20:36:00 REPRESENT THE OWNERSHIP OF CAPITOL SQUARE OR THE LOCALE RETAIL.
I DO APPRECIATE ALL THE THOUGHTS THAT 
20:36:11 THE COUNCILMEMBERS HAVE SHARED HERE, BOTH IN SUPPORT AND I GUESS IN QUESTIONING, AND  MY -- I JUST WANTED 
20:36:18 TO ECHO SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT CHRISTINA AND JOEL PUT FORTH, BECAUSE WE DID -- WE HAVE WORKED WITH THE TEAM 
20:36:26 FOR QUITE A WHILE, AND IT HAS BEEN A CHALLENGING TIME FOR RETAIL.
AND WHILE THINGS ARE CHANGING, 
20:36:39 RETAILERS CERTAINLY ARE NOT COMING TO THE TABLE AS AGGRESSIVELY AS THEY ONCE WERE, AND THEY ARE MUCH MORE LEERY OF 
20:36:44 CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND IT IS JUST A DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENT FROM AN OWNERSHIP PERSPECTIVE, ONE GETTING 
20:36:53 INTEREST IN ACTIVITY AND TWO, THE COST OF THAT.
AND WE'RE HAPPY THAT WE HAVE BEEN ABLE 
20:37:01 TO BRING RAW ASF AND SLIVER TO THAT POINT, SLIVER IS GOING TO BE A VERY LIVE AND ACTIVE USE.

20:37:08 IT INCORPORATES BOTH FOOD AND MUSIC, AS HAS BEEN SUGGESTED AS AN OPPORTUNITY HERE, AND I THINK IT WILL BE -- IT'S A 
20:37:16 GREAT PLACE TO HAVE RIGHT ACROSS FROM THE COMMUNITY CENTER.
BUT THERE IS CERTAINLY ALSO A NEED, AN 
20:37:24 INTEREST FOR THOSE RETAILERS TO HAVE COMPLIMENTARY USES ADJACENT.
BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE ALL RESTAURANTS, 
20:37:34 THEN THERE WILL BE ACTION AT THE LUNCH MOMENT AND THE DINNER MOMENT BUT YOU WILL LOSE TRAFFIC THROUGH THE REST OF 
20:37:44 THE DAY, AND IF YOU HAVE SORT OF A ONE STOP SHOP OPPORTUNITY FROM A RETAIL PERSPECTIVE NOT TRYING TO RE-CREATE 
20:37:52 ANYTHING ELSE THAT MIGHT BE IN THE CITY OTHERWISE BUT ON A LIMITED BASIS, YOU  KNOW, MEDICAL OFFICE OR OTHER PERSONAL 
20:37:58 SERVICES, SOME OF WHICH HAVE BEEN RELAXED IN THIS SUGGESTED AMENDMENT, YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY OR THE 
20:38:04  ABILITY -- YOU PRESENT THOSE RETAILERS THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE MORE TRAFFIC DURING THESE OFF HOURS THROUGHOUT THE 
20:38:07 DAY.
AND I THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO BE 
20:38:15 COMPLEMENTARY TO THOSE USERS, TO THE CITY, AND JUST CREATE AN ACTIVE, MORE LIVELY ENVIRONMENT ON THAT CORRIDOR.

20:38:24 SO WITH THAT, I JUST -- YOU  KNOW, CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE THOUGHTS BUT WANTED TO VOICE MY THINKING AS WELL.

20:38:30 SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU FOR SHARING THAT.

20:38:36 I ALSO WAS JUST GOING TO BRING IN THE REST OF THE  COUNCILMEMBERS BUT I WILL NOTE THAT RIGHT ACROSS FROM THAT AREA, 
20:38:43 THERE IS ALREADY SOME EXISTING MEDICAL BUILDINGS AND I DO BELIEVE ONE OF MY CONCERNS THERE IS THE VACANCY, BECAUSE 
20:38:51 I THINK THAT'S -- THEY'RE CONDOIZED MEDICAL FACILITIES, MOSTLY DENTAL, I THINK, IN PRACTICE, SO I'M JUST A 
20:38:56 LITTLE BIT CONCERNED THAT IF WE BRING MORE OF THAT, WE WOULD END UP WITH MORE VACANCY.

20:39:03 I WOULD LOVE TO EXPLORE SOME UNIQUE RETAIL, I WOULD LOVE SOME DIFFERENT FOOD IN TERMS OF, YOU KNOW, EITHER 
20:39:10 GREAT PHO OR SOMETHING, DIFFERENT PLACES,  BUT -- OR EVEN THINGS LIKE I WOULD SAY IF WE WANT TO STEM INTO 
20:39:16 EDUCATIONAL BUT SOMETHING FUN, LIKE I SAW THE LEGO DISCOVERY LAND THAT'S DOWN FURTHER SOUTH IN DIFFERENT  
20:39:22 PARTS, BECAUSE WHEN WE'RE ABLE TO BRING OUR CITY AND SOME OF THE HERITAGE OR ART IN OTHER AREAS, IT WOULD BE 
20:39:25 GREAT.
COUNCILMEMBER JONES, YOU HAD YOUR HAND RAISED, THEN COUNCILMEMBER KENG AND 
20:39:30 CHRISTINA, AFTER WHICH WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A BREAK AFTER WE MAKE THIS VOTE BECAUSE WE'RE EXCEEDING OUR TIME FOR 
20:39:36 THE STENOCAPTIONER BREAK.
OH, I CLOSED THE PUBLIC HEARING AGAIN, JUST TO REPEAT.

20:39:40 >> Councilmember Jones: OKAY.
SO QUICK QUESTION FOR JOEL OR CHRISTINA, WHOEVER WOULD LIKE TO 
20:39:49 RESPOND.
REGARDING COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN'S KIND OF SUGGESTION THAT WE LOOK AT THIS 
20:39:55 WITH THE THREE DIFFERENT DESIGNATIONS IN MIND, WITH THE MAP THAT YOU PROVIDED.

20:40:02 SO FOR INSTANCE, LOCALE AT STATE STREET, YOU HAVE TO REFRESH MY MEMORY BECAUSE I HAVEN'T BEEN OUT MUCH DURING 
20:40:10 THE PANDEMIC, BUT SO THE RED ZONE ON CAPITAL THAT GOES UP TO THE CORNER OF STATE STREET IS ALL RETAIL.

20:40:14 IS THERE ANY RETAIL SPACE AVAILABLE THAT FACES STATE STREET, OR IS THAT ALL RESIDENTIAL?

20:40:25 >> CHRISTINA, CAN YOU ANSWER THAT ONE?
I KNOW LOCALE ON CAPITAL WILL BUT NOT ON THE SIDE STREET.

20:40:31 >> THERE ARE CORRIDOR END UNITS, THAT WOULD BE THE ONLY RETAIL, THERE'S NO RETAIL ON THAT -- IN THAT PROJECT THAT 
20:40:37 LINES STATE STREET.
IT LINES CAPITOL AVENUE.
>> Councilmember Jones: OKAY.

20:40:46 BECAUSE I'M KIND OF CURIOUS, AND YOU GUYS, YOU'RE IN THE MIDST OF THIS AND I KNOW ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IS ALWAYS 
20:40:50 TRYING TO THINK OF CREATIVE IDEAS TO BRING WHATEVER KIND OF BUSINESSES THAT WE CAN GET IN.

20:41:00 WHAT WOULD -- OR HOW DIFFICULT WOULD IT BE TO SAY OKAY, MAYBE WE SHOULD CHANGE THE PERCENTAGE TO NOT ALLOW AS MUCH AS 
20:41:04 40% IN THE RED ZONES AS OPPOSED TO THE OTHER TWO ZONES THAT YOU HAVE OUTLINED?

20:41:12 >> WELL, I GUESS I WOULD RESPOND TO YOUR QUESTION, COUNCILMEMBER JONES, TO SAY QUITE HONESTLY, THE CAPITOL AVENUE 
20:41:20 ZONE IS THE ZONE WE'RE PROBABLY MOST FOCUSED ON IN THIS EXERCISE BECAUSE IT IS REALLY THE RETAIL FOCUS FOR 
20:41:23 DOWNTOWN.
WE SORT OF REFER TO IT AS THE RETAIL SPINE.

20:41:29 AND PART OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO SAY TONIGHT IS THAT THE FUNDAMENTAL DEFINITION OF WHAT CONSTITUTES RETAIL 
20:41:38 AND RETAIL SPACE IS JUST -- IT HAS CHANGED FOR WHEN THIS ZONING WAS ESTABLISHED AND WE'RE TRYING TO FIND 
20:41:43 THE RIGHT BALANCE TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT SPACE GETS OCCUPIED.
I HAVE SOME POINTS OF CLARIFICATION I 
20:41:49 WOULD LOVE TO MAKE, BUT I KNOW THAT COUNCILMEMBER KENG HAS ALSO RAISED A HAND AND I'LL DEFER TO YOU, MADAME 
20:41:53 MAYOR, IF YOU WANT ME TO DO THAT NOW OR NOT.
>> Mayor Mei: SURE, IF YOU WANT TO 
20:41:58 MAKE THE POINT OF CLARIFICATION, PERHAPS YOU WILL BE ADDRESSING SOME OF THE CONCERNS FROM COUNCILMEMBER  
20:42:03 KENG.
>> JUST TO CLARIFY, YOU KNOW, SORT OF A COUPLE OF FINE POINTS AND THEN MAYBE 
20:42:08 A COUPLE MORE BROAD POINTS.
SO I WANT TO MAKE SURE EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS THAT WHEN WE'RE TALKING 
20:42:14 ABOUT EDUCATION AND EDUCATIONAL SERVICES, THAT TERM HAS BEEN USED A LOT THIS  EVENING, THIS DOES NOT 
20:42:20 INCLUDE TUTORING, THIS IS OTHER TYPES OF EDUCATION THAT THE ZONING CURRENTLY PRECLUDES.

20:42:25 I HAVE USED THE EXAMPLE, YOU KNOW, OF SOMETHING LIKE A COOKING SCHOOL.
THAT IS CURRENTLY NOT ALLOWED.

20:42:31 SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS THIS DOES NOT MEAN TUTORING USES.

20:42:39 SIMILARLY, I WANT TO ALSO CLARIFY THAT WE ARE -- LIKE I MENTIONED THROUGH THIS EXERCISE, WE'RE ACTUALLY TRYING 
20:42:45 TO EXPAND OR MAKE EASIER CERTAIN THINGS SO WE'VE DISCUSSED THE RESTAURANT, YOU KNOW, MAKING THAT A LESS ONEROUS 
20:42:51 PROCESS FOR RESTAURANTS, AND TO ALLOW THEM BY RIGHT, BUT WE'RE ALSO -- COUNCILMEMBER JONES TO YOUR POINT, 
20:42:58 HAVE A MORE ACTIVE ENTERTAINMENT WHERE THE YOUNG UR CROWD GOES WHERE WE'RE MAKING WHAT WE CALL INDOOR RECREATION 
20:43:02 EASIER.
SO BILLIARDS, FOR EXAMPLE, THAT'S CURRENTLY SOMETHING THAT IS 
20:43:06 CHALLENGING IN THE DOWNTOWN ENVIRONMENT.
I THINK THIS ZONING WAS ESTABLISHED 
20:43:15 LIKE JOEL MENTIONED AT A TIME WHEN WE WERE MAYBE NERVOUS, TO USE COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN'S PHRASE, SO WE 
20:43:22 WERE DIPPING OUR TOE IN NOT WANTING TO GET TOO WILD TOO FAST, BUT WE NOW KNOW THAT THAT -- WE PROBABLY TOOK THAT A 
20:43:28 LITTLE BIT TOO FAR.
SO WE'RE TRYING TO PEEL THAT BACK ON INDOOR RECREATION, SO I WANTED TO MAKE 
20:43:34 SURE TO CLARIFY THAT.
AND THEN I ALSO JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS THAT THE 40% BY 
20:43:43 NO MEANS DOES THAT MEAN THAT 40% OF THE SPACE WILL ACCOMMODATE THESE USES THAT ARE IN QUESTION, IT IS MERELY THE 
20:43:49 CAP.
SO OUR HOPE IS THAT IN ACTUALITY IT WILL BE QUITE A BIT LESS THAN THAT BUT 
20:43:54 WE WANTED TO PLACE PER THE PREVIOUS COUNCIL DISCUSSION IN APRIL, WE WANTED TO PLACE SOME SORT OF UPPER END LIMIT 
20:44:02 ON IT, ON THE ACTIVITY.
IT'S WORTH NOTING, PLACES LIKE DOWNTOWN, MORE DOWNTOWN PALO ALTO, 
20:44:09 THEY ALLOW THINGS LIKE MEDICAL OFFICE AND I WOULD ACTUALLY SAY, TOO, WHEN WE'RE THINKING ABOUT MEDICAL OFFICE IN 
20:44:17 THIS PART OF THE DOWNTOWN, WE'RE THINKING ABOUT SOME OF THESE  NEWER TRENDS IN DETAIL LIKE CARBON HEALTH OR 
20:44:23 ONE MEDICAL IF YOU'VE HEARD EITHER OF THOSE, THEY DON'T WANT THE TRADITIONAL MEDICAL OFFICE LIKE WE SEE IN A LOT OF 
20:44:29 THE CITY CENTER, THEY DON'T WANT THAT MUCH SPACE, THEY DON'T EVEN WANT THAT KIND OF BUILDOUT, THEY JUST WANT THAT 
20:44:36 RETAIL STOREFRONT THAT THEY DO VERY LIMITED KIND OF ACTIVITIES WITH, IT'S A VERY VIBRANT STOREFRONT, PLANNING 
20:44:41 WOULD MAINTAIN STRONG REQUIREMENTS ON THE STOREFRONTS OF ANY OF THESE USES TO COMPLY WITH KIND OF OUR FORM-BASED 
20:44:47 STANDARDS IN THE DOWNTOWN.
SO I GUESS I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE ARE ALL REALLY CLEAR TO YOU 
20:44:53 GUYS IN THIS DISCUSSION.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU, COUNCILMEMBER KENG, AND THEN I SEE DONOVAN HAS HIS 
20:45:25 HAND RAISED AND I JUST AGAIN WANT TO REMIND PEOPLE WE HAVE TO TAKE A BREAK SOON$TO LIKE HANG OUT ENTERTAINMENT OR 
20:45:40 YOU KNOW FOR FAMILIES, TO BE LIKE A SAFE ZONE.
SO I KNOW THAT PEOPLE REALLY LIKE WITH 
20:45:47 WITH A FOOD TRUCK AND THERE ARE FACES FOR KIDS TO PLAY AT.
SO YOU KNOW, PEOPLE REALLY LIKE THOSE 
20:45:54 FRIDAY NIGHTS AND THEY MISS THOSE.
SO I THINK IF WE COULD, YOU KNOW, ALSO RECREATE SOME OF  THAT.

20:46:01 IN THIS YEAR.
THEN I THINK THAT WOULD BE A GREAT PLACE FOR CITIZENS TO GO TO.

20:46:10 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.
DONOVAN, DID YOU WANT TO CLOSE THIS?
>> YES, THANK YOU MAYOR I KNOW WE ARE 
20:46:15 SHORT ON TIME SO I'LL TRY TO MAKE IT QUICK.
ING COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN'S REMARKS 
20:46:20 ABOUT SANTANA ROW BE ACTUALLY HAD ME THINKING ABOUT MY ACTIVITIES OVER THE WEEKEND.

20:46:34 I ACTUALLY WENT TO SANTANA ROW, I WENT TO WARBEY PARKER, GOT NEW GLASSES, GOT FOOD, DOESN'T A NEARBY RESTAURANT, 
20:46:41 THAT SORT OF SPONTANEOUS VERY SYNERGISTIC EXPERIENCE, BETWEEN ME EATING LUNCH AND GOING

20:46:50 TO THE OPTOMETRIST IS I THINK WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO EMPHASIZE HERE WITH THIS BALANCE-MIX APPROACH.

20:46:56 ALSO WANTED TO EMPHASIZE THAT THE 40% LIMIT, THAT THAT CAP ALSO INCLUDES FITNESS USES.

20:47:06 AND SO WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THE 40%, I THINK OUR BRAINS TEND TO IMMEDIATELY ASSUMING SORT OF A KIND OF WORSE-CASE 
20:47:13 SCENARIO OR A SITUATION WHERE YOU'D HAVE 40% OF THE SPACE AUTOMATICALLY GO TO MEDICAL

20:47:20 OFFICES.
BUT THERE ARE A RANGE OF OTHER USES TO CHRISTINA'S POINT,  INDOOR RECREATION, 
20:47:26 FITNESS AS WELL, IT'S INTENDED TO ALLOW A LITTLE BIT OF FLEXIBILITY WHILE ALSO MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE PRIORITIZING 
20:47:32 THE
KINDS OF USES THAT WE ALL REALLY WANT TO SEE IN DOWNTOWN FREMONT.

20:47:36 >> Mayor Mei:   COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN I HAVE SOME COMMENTS IF YOU'RE NOT MAKING THE MOTION YET BUT I WAS GOING 
20:47:43 TO MAKE A GENERAL COMMENT.
>> Councilmember Salwan:   GO NO MOTION.

20:47:47 >> Mayor Mei:   GO AHEAD.
>> Councilmember Salwan:    WANTED TO GET STAFF PERSPECTIVE, IF WE COULD 
20:47:54 HAVE A LOWER PERCENTAGE ON THE FREMONT BOULEVARD AND CAPITOL, WHEN I THINK ABOUT 40% I REALIZE YOU ARE MAKING A 
20:47:58 GOOD POINT
THAT'S CAP.
BUT I THINK OF IT AS HALF THE 
20:48:08 BUILDINGS WILL BE EDUCATIONAL, MEDICAL AND ALL THE OTHER USES OR UP TO.
IF WE HAD A CAP OF 20%, YOU  KNOW, 
20:48:17 THAT IS OF SOME BENEFIT, THE OWNER COULD FILL THOSE PLACES.
AND AS YOU GO TO PASEO, YOU COULD GET 
20:48:26 CLOSE TO 40, NEAR  PEETS.
KIND OF HOLD THE LINE TO ENCOURAGE THE KIND OF RETAIL AND RESTAURANTS?

20:48:32 >> I THINK THAT'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT WE CAN LOOK AT AS STAFF IF THAT IS SOMETHING THE COUNCIL WOULD LIKE US 
20:48:39 TO CONSIDER WE CAN BRING BACK A FOLLOWING RECOMMENDATION FOR  YOU.
>> Mayor Mei:   I WROTE SUPPORT THAT 
20:48:48  WOULD SUPPORT THAT IDEA.
I ALSO WANT DOWNTOWN FREMONT STORE, PRIDE OF FREMONT STORE, I WOULD LOVE 
20:48:57 TO HAVE SOMETHING LIKE THAT BUT I HAVE A MOTION BY --
>> MR. SORRY, MADAM MAYOR, CORRECT ME 
20:49:03 IF I'M WRONG DEBRA OR IF THE COUNCIL WANTS TO GIVE US THAT DIRECTION TONIGHT TO JUST CHANGE THE PERCENTAGE 
20:49:12 WE COULD DO THAT AS WELL.
>> Mayor Mei:   SORRY.
>> YES, YOU COULD THAT WOULD BE WITHIN 
20:49:17 THE PARAMETERS OF WHAT'S BEEN NOTICED IF YOU WANTED TO REDUCE THE PERCENTAGE TO SOMETHING LOWER THAN 40%.

20:49:31 >> Mayor Mei:   COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN DID YOU WANT TO REPEAT THAT AGAIN SO WE COULD GET THAT ON RECORD NOTED AND 
20:49:37 SEE IF THERE'S A SECOND.
>> Councilmember Salwan:   YES I'D LIKE TO MAKE A MOTION TO REDUCE THE 
20:49:42 DOWNTOWN WHAT YOU WOULD CALL IT FLEXIBILITY TO 20% FOR THE OTHER USES TO MAINTAIN THE CURRENT RETAIL 
20:49:49 RESTAURANTS AND SO FORTH AND
ALSO INCENTIVIZE THE RESTAURANT ZONING PROCESS THAT YOU HAVE  OUTLINED.

20:49:58 >> Councilmember Shao:   I SECOND.
>> Mayor Mei:   MOTION BY COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN, SECOND BY VICE 
20:50:03 MAYOR SHAO.
PLEASE VOTE PLEASE.
ROLL CALL VOTE, SORRY SUSAN YOU ARE ON

>> Mayor Mei:   SO THE PROPOSED 
20:50:35 RECOMMENDED ACTION WAS PROPOSED BY COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN AND SECONDED BY VICE MAYOR SHAO AND IT PASSED 
20:50:39 UNANIMOUSLY.
I'M GOING TO CALL FOR A TEN MINUTE BREAK.

20:50:47 WE'LL COME BACK AT 9:00 SO WE CAN CONTINUE OUR NEXT GO ITEMS AND I APPRECIATE EVERYONE'S PATIENCE BUT WE 
20:50:51 WANT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE THOUGHTFUL TO OUR STENO CAPTIONER.
THANKS.

20:50:57 PLEASE MAKE SURE TO TURN OFF YOUR CAMERA AND TO MUTE YOURSELF WHILE ON THE BREAK.

21:00:02 THANK YOU.
[ RECESS ]
>> Mayor Mei:   WE'LL BE COMING BACK.

21:00:58 WELCOME BACK.
I THINK WE'RE STILL MISSING ONE COUNCILMEMBER.

21:01:16 COUNCILMEMBER COX.
WONDERFUL.
>> Councilmember Cox:   RIGHT HERE.

21:01:29 >> Mayor Mei:   WHY DON'T WE BEGIN.
WE'RE GOING TO RETURN TO ITEM NUMBER 8A AND THE FIRST ITEM IS A COUNCIL 
21:01:39 REFERRAL.
AND THAT'S FROM COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN WHO IS GOING TO BE SHARING A REFERRAL, 
21:01:51 DIRECTING STAFF TO REVIEW ORDINANCES TO OTHER CITIES PERTAINING TO URBAN AGRICULTURE, ARE REGARDING LIFE 
21:02:00  LIVESTOCK.
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN.
>> Councilmember Kassan:   EVEN 
21:02:08 SOMEONE ON VACATION RIGHT NOW, THANK YOU FOR STAYING SO LATE AND COMING TO THE MEETING TONIGHT TO SPEAK.

21:02:20 SO I HEARD -- MANY OF US STARTED HEARING, THERE WAS A PETITION GOING AROUND BECAUSE WE HAD A COMMUNITY 
21:02:30 MEMBER WHO HAD GOATS, SHE WAS KEEPING TWO MINIATURE GOATS ON HER LOT, SHE HAD A

21:02:33 PRETTY LARGE LOT.
A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY LOVED THE GOATS.

21:02:40 HER DAUGHTER IS WORKING WITH THE GOATS AND LEARNING A LOT ABOUT RURAL FARMING STUFF BY WORKING WITH THE GOATS AND 
21:02:46 OTHER THINGS THAT THEY'RE DOING AT THEIR PROPERTY.
BACK BEFORE I WAS ON COUNCIL BACK IN 
21:02:55 THE SUMMER OF 2018, THERE WAS AN ITEM ON CONSENT CALENDAR THAT CHANGED OUR ANIMAL CODE AND MADE IT NO LONGER 
21:03:05 LEGAL TO HAVE GOATS IN FREMONT.
AND WHEN I ASKED STAFF WHY THAT HAPPENED, THEY SAID IT WAS BECAUSE 
21:03:12 FREMONT WAS BECOMING A MORE URBANIZED CITY A MORE DENSE CITY.
WE DEFINITELY CAN HAVE PARTS OF 
21:03:19 FREMONT THAT CAN ACCOMMODATE WHY ANIMALS REALLY WELL, THIS PROPERTY IS VERY LARGE.

21:03:27 MANY URBAN CITIES DO ALLOW GOATS AND OTHER SIMILAR KINDS OF ANIMALS.
I UNDERSTAND WE NEED -- WE CAN'T JUST 
21:03:35 SAY GOATS AREN'T ALLOWED, WE NEED TO DO SOME THINKING ABOUT HOW TO DO IT.
MAYBE IT'S JUST FEMALE GOATS, NEUTERED 
21:03:46 GOATS, A CERTAIN NUMBER AND NO MORE THAN A CERTAIN NUMBER.
BUT I SERGE THINK WE CAN ACCOMMODATE 
21:03:56 GOATS ON OUR RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY AND WE COULD GO AHEAD AND MAKE THAT HAPPEN SO THIS FAMILY, THE  CHITLE FAMILY 
21:04:04  DON'T
HAVE TO GIVE UP THEIR TWO MINIATURE GOATS.

21:04:07 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU FOR THE INTRODUCTION.
I DON'T KNOW IF THERE ARE ANY 
21:04:14 QUESTIONS FROM THE COUNCILMEMBERS, BUT JUST TO CLARIFY, THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS AMENDED THROUGH ANIMAL 
21:04:17 SERVICES DEPARTMENT WITH JUST WITHIN OUR POLICE DEPARTMENT JUST
TO CLARIFY.

21:04:26 IT WASN'T THROUGH THE LAND USE ZONING.
I SEE WE HAVE OUR CHIEF ON THE LINE TODAY TO ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS.

21:04:39 SO WITH THAT WE'RE GOING TO TURN IT OVER TO THE SPEAKERS AT THIS TIME.
PLEASE.

21:04:45 THANK YOU FOR ALL THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE ALREADY WRITTEN US JUST TO NOTE WE DID READ THOSE AND RECEIVE THOSE TOO.

21:04:51 SO IF YOU HAVE ADMINISTRATOR WRITTEN PLEASE NOTE WE HAVE ALREADY RECEIVED THOSE.

21:05:01 IF THE SPEAKER WHO IS SPEAKING SHARE SIMILAR SENTIMENTS PLEASE SHARE THAT YOU HAVE THEIR COMMENTS.

21:05:14 FIRST SPEAKS SHASHONNA CHITTLE.
>> I'M A THIRD GENERATION FREMONT RESIDENT RAISING MY CHILDREN HERE ON 
21:05:23 MY  GRANDPARENTS' FARM.
IT IS TWO-THIRDS OF AN ACRE.
IT WAS BUILT AND FOUNDED BY MILLICENT 
21:05:31 SHIN OF THE SHIN HISTORIC PARK AND ARBORETUM.
I'M HERE TONIGHT TO ASK YOU PLEASE 
21:05:38 ALLOW MY FAMILY TO KEEP OUR GOATS AND ALSO TO RECONSIDER -- HOLD ON JUST ONE SECOND.

21:05:46 I NEED YOU TO CLOSE YOUR DOOR, IT'S ECHOING.
SORRY, MY DAUGHTER IS ON THE CALL TOO 
21:05:55 AND PLANNING TO SPEAK.
SO I'D LIKE YOU TO RECONSIDER THE REPEAL OF FMC 6 THAT WAS DONE IN 2018 
21:06:06 AND I WOULD LIKE YOU TO RECONSIDER EITHER  REINSTATING THE PREVIOUS LAW OR WRITE SOMETHING NEW

21:06:17 THAT WILL TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE ECOLOGICAL CRISIS WE ARE IN.
THE CENTRAL VALLEY IS PROJECTED TO BE 
21:06:25 UNINHABITABLE IN THE NEXT 20 YEARS.
WE NEED TO GROW FOOD CLOSER TO HOME.
RIGHT NOW THERE'S ANOTHER PROBLEM HANG 
21:06:32 DUE TO  OVERDEVELOPMENT.
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW BUT CALIFORNIA IS HOME TO 6500 NATIVE 
21:06:42  SPECIES FOUND NOWHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD, THIS IS PLANTS.
IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS 3200 OF THEM ARE 
21:06:50 DUE TO GO EXTINCT DUE TO DEVELOPMENT.
THE ONLY WAY THESE PLANTS CAN CONTINUE IS IF WE PLANT THEM IN OUR YARDS AND 
21:07:02 ONE WAY WE CAN HELP THESE PLANTS TAKE OVER IS BY HAVING GOATS EAT THE INVASIVE SPECIES, STERILIZE THE SOILS 
21:07:08 AND HELP THE IF
THE PLANTS TO GROW.
THEY WILL HELP TO SEQUESTER WATER AND 
21:07:14 HELP REPOPULATE THE  ENDANGERED SPECIES OF ANIMALS THAT ARE ENDANGERED AS WELL.

21:07:21 I HOPE YOU TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THAT DISEANABILITY IS NOT JUST A MATTER OF GROWING DENSER AND DENSER, BUT THAT WE 
21:07:25 ACTUALLY NEED TO HAVE FOOD AND WATER AVAILABLE IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND IT CAN BE A

21:07:30 BEAUTIFUL THING.
IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD, MY NEIGHBORS AND I ARE SHARING FRUIT, THE CHILDREN COME 
21:07:39 AND PLAY WITH OUR GOATS AND ARE LEARNING ABOUT THE CARE OF ANIMALS.
WE CAN CREATE A VIBRANT FREMONT.

21:07:46 THAT PRODUCES SOME OF ITS OWN FOOD AND WE CAN DO IT AND HAVE A LOT OF FUN AND HAVE A REALLY BEAUTIFUL CITY.

21:07:56 ONE LAST NOTE ABOUT GOATS THAT I WANT YOU TO KNOW IS A MINI  MILKER LIKE MY GOAT NADIA CAN PRODUCE THREE GALLONS 
21:08:01 OF MILK A DAY.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND I HOPE YOU CAN SUPPORT US TO KEEP OUR GOATS.

21:08:19 GOOD NIGHT.
[ DISTORTED ]
>> AM I COMING THROUGH, I WONDER IF 
21:08:22 YOU CAN HEAR ME.
>> Mayor Mei:   YES.
>> THANK YOU.

21:08:31 I JUST WANT TO SORT OF SALUTE THE CHITTLE FAMILY, I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO VISIT THEM AND HAD A CHANCE TO SEE 
21:08:36 THE GOATS AND I MUST SAY THEY HAVE REALLY DONE A WONDERFUL JOB IN  EDUCATING THEIR

21:08:43 CHILDREN AND BRINGING THEM IN THROUGH 4H AND HOPEFULLY WE'LL HEAR FROM ELKA HERSELF.

21:08:49 I THINK THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY IN SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT HAVE COME UP AROUND THEIR ABILITY TO KEEP GOATS ON THEIR 
21:08:58 PROPERTY AND I THINK THOSE OPPORTUNITIES ARE HOW A CITY WORKS WITH THE

21:09:03 NATURAL ANIMALS WITHIN THE CITY ITSELF.
SINCE OBVIOUSLY FREMONT IS  RAPIDLY 
21:09:11 DEVELOPING AS SUBURBAN AND URBAN, THERE IS STILL A STRONG HERITAGE OF AGRICULTURE IN FREMONT AND THERE'S 
21:09:16 STILL POCKETS OF LAND THAT ARE OPEN SUCH AS THE CHITTLE
 FAMILY HAS.

21:09:24 AND I THINK WE CAN REVIEW AND RELOOK AT THE CODES THAT WE SET UP AND I THINK THAT THIS WILL BE MAYBE A BEGINNING IN 
21:09:30 SOME OF THE OTHER AREAS OF NATURAL -- WELL, THE SPECIES THAT WE ARE WORKING WITH.

21:09:38 AND THIS IS GOING TO COME UP, AN AREA THAT A LOT OF BEE KEEPERS ARE GOING TO BE INTERESTED IN AND I SUSPECT THERE'S 
21:09:44 SOME COMMENTS FROM THEM.
I THANK FOR THE CITY COUNCIL TO GIVE ATTENTION TO THIS AND I HOPE WE FIND A 
21:09:52 GOOD RESOLUTION FOR THE CHITTLE FAMILY AND AN OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AT THE CODES WE SET UP FOR ANIMAL SERVICES 
21:09:54 WITHIN
FREMONT.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

21:10:02 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.
NEXT SPEAKER IS GOING TO BE  ALHAM MARTER.

21:10:11 >> DEAR FREMONT CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS, MY NAME IS ALHAM MARTER I'M A LAWYER AND LONG TIME FREMONT RESIDENT AND 
21:10:26 NEIGHBOR TO SHAWNA CHITTLE.
HER AND HER FAMILY HAVE TWO MINIATURE GOATS, NADIA AND BUTTERCUP.

21:10:31 THERE HAVE BEEN NO COMPLAINTS THEIR GOATS.
THEY HAVE BEEN ADVISED HOWEVER THAT 
21:10:41 PURSUANT TO FMC 6.DEN THEY ARE NOT PERMITTED TO KEEP THEIR GOATS.
UNFORTUNATELY, FMC 6.

21:10:52 10 IS FLAWED AND MYOPIC.
NOT ALL ANIMALS ARE CATEGORIES AND DOGS.

21:11:03 GOATS ARE VERY INTERESTING BEINGS.
WHY DOES CITY OF FREMONT DETERMINE WHICH ANIMALS ARE  IRVE-ING OF OUR 
21:11:09 LOVE.
NADIA AND BUTTERCUP ARE LOVED.
ALL THE CHILDREN IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD 
21:11:17 GO AND SEE NADIA AND BUTTERCUP THEY ARE SO GENTLE AND THERAPEUTIC AND BRING JOY TO EVERYONE.

21:11:23 ALMOST EVERY DAY MY  FOUR-YEAR-OLD SON ASKS IF WE CAN GO TO ADLER COURT TO SEE THE GOATS.

21:11:31 I ALSO LOVE WATCHING HOW MUCH NADIA LOVES ELKA OUR NEIGHBOR'S DAUGHTER.
SHE TAKES SUCH GOOD CARE OF  THEM, 
21:11:39 THEY HAVE A SPECIAL BOND.
THERE IS NO DENYING THAT NADIA AND BUTTERCUP ARE LOVED BY NADIA AND THIS 
21:11:44 FAMILY.
I ASK THE FREMONT CITY COUNCIL BROADEN ITS UNDERSTANDING OF WHICH ANIMALS ARE 
21:11:50 WORTHY OF OUR COMPANIONSHIP.
THESE GOATS ARE BELOVED BY OUR NEIGHBORHOOD AND WOULD BE HEART BROKEN 
21:12:00 TO SEE THAT THEY'RE REMOVED.
WE EVEN HAVE A PETITION ASKING FREMONT CITY COUNCIL TO ALLOW CAN BUTTERCUP 
21:12:07 AND NADIA TO STAY WITH THEIR FAMILY.
IT HAS OVER 42,500 SIGNATURES.
WE ARE ASKING THAT FREMONT CITY 
21:12:15 COUNCIL PLEASE REVISE FMC 6.10 AND ALLOW OUR NEIGHBORS TO KEEP NADIA AND BUTTERCUP.

21:12:23 THEY BELONG WITH THEIR FAMILY, THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

21:12:34 THE NEXT SPEAKER IS KEITH  P  PARKER.
KEITH.
>> HELLO.

21:12:39 SO I WOULD LIKE TO TELL YOU A STORY.
IT IS A STORY ABOUT A FAMILY THAT TRIED TO FOLLOW RULES.

21:12:45 TO DO THE RIGHT THING.
IT IS A STORY ABOUT A FREMONT FAMILY.
A FAMILY THAT HAS BEEN HERE SINCE 
21:12:51 BEFORE FREMONT WAS  FREMONT.
TODAY THE FOURTH GENERATION OF THIS FAMILY NOW LIVES IN THE SAME FREMONT 
21:12:58 HOUSE THAT HAS BEEN A HOME TO THIS FAMILY FOR ALMOST SIX DECADES.
A HOME THAT HAS BEEN PART OF A SMALL 
21:13:05 FARM FOR THAT ENTIRE PERIOD.
AND ON THIS FARM THEY HAD SOME GOATS.
THEY HAD SOME GOATS MANY TIMES OVER 
21:13:11 MANY YEARS.
AND NOW IN AN EFFORT TO LIVE MORE SUSTAINABLY, TO LIVE IN AN 
21:13:17 ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY WAY THEY ONCE AGAIN HAVE SOME GOATS.
THESE GOATS ARE MINIATURE GOATS.

21:13:23 SMALL AND UNOBTRUSIVE.
THEY BOTHER NO ONE.
WHAT THEY DO HOWEVER IS TO PROVIDE A 
21:13:27 BENEFIT TO THE COMMUNITY BY BRINGING PEOPLE TOGETHER.
TO THE ENVIRONMENT.

21:13:34 BY CONTROLLING INVASIVE SPECIES AND MANAGING WEEDS WITHOUT BURNING GASOLINE.

21:13:40 TOD NEIGHBORHOOD CHILDREN THAT LEARN ABOUT THEM AND FROM THEM.
 THESE GOATS HELP EVERYONE AND HARM NO 
21:13:47 ONE.
BUT WHEN THIS DPEAM THAT HAD BEEN A PART OF FREMONT FOR SO LONG TRIED TO 
21:13:54 REGISTER THEIR GOATS JUST EVERY TIME EVERY OTHER TIME THEY HAD LEGAL GOATS ON THIS VERY PROPERTY IN THE PAST THEY 
21:14:01 WERE TOLD
THAT GOATS ON THEIR FARM WERE NO LONGER ALLOWED.

21:14:12 THEY WERE TOLD THEY HAD TO GET RID OF THESE TINY MINIATURE GOATS WHICH HARM NO ONE.

21:14:18 WHICH BRINGS US TODAY.
TODAY YOU HAVE A RARE OPPORTUNITY .
YOU HAVE A OPPORTUNITY TO RIGHT A 
21:14:25 WRONG, TO CORRECT AN  INJUSTICE.
YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SOLVE A PROBLEM FOR A FREMONT SYSTEM IN A DEEP 
21:14:33 AND MEANINGFUL WAY.
YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE A STAND ON SUSTAINABILITY ON THE 
21:14:38 ENVIRONMENT.
A MATTER YOU EVERY ONE OF YOU HAVE CLAIMED TO CARE PROFOUNDLY ABOUT.

21:14:51 THIS MATTER IS NOT SOME ESOTERIC CAN RECOLLECTION.
THEY TRIED TO FOLLOW THE RULES BUT 
21:14:57 THEY COULDN'T BECAUSE THE RULES CHANGED ON THEM HALFWAY THROUGH THE GAME.
I'M HERE TO ASK YOU TO DO THE RIGHT 
21:15:04 THING DOM DO WHAT THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY HAS QUITE  VOCALLY TOLD YOU THEY WANT YOU TO DO.

21:15:11 TO GIVE THE FAMILY THE RIGHT TO HAVE THEIR PETS, THE RIGHT THEY SHOULD HAVE ALWAYS HAD AND NEVER EVER TAKEN AWAY 
21:15:16 FROM THEM.
THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei:   NEXT SPEAKER IS NIKKI 
21:15:31 IRVINE.
>> WHERE THANK YOU TO ALL THE CITY COUNCILORS THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK 
21:15:39 ABOUT 8A 1, TO PROMOTE URBAN AGRICULTURE.
MY NAME IS NIKKI IRVINE AND I'M 
21:15:50 SPEAKING AS THE COORDINATOR OF THE LEGAL PROJECT.
WE HAVE BEEN WORKING SINCE 2013 TO THE 
21:15:58 CHANGE ONEROUS BEE KEEPING CODES.
CAN VARIOUS REGULATIONS IN OUR REGION AND ELSEWHERE AND  ASSESSED HOW WELL 
21:16:06 THEY WORK FOR NEIGHBORS, CITY STAFF AND BEE KEEPERS AND BEES.
CODE ENFORCEMENT WAS VERY HELPFUL AS 
21:16:11 WE DEVELOPED  PRACTICAL RECOMMENDATIONS.
AS A RESULT WE OFFERED TO WORK WITH 
21:16:15 FREMONT STAFF TO HELP SPEED UP YOUR ASSESSMENT OF ALTERNATIVE BEE KEEPING  POLICIES.

21:16:24 THIS WOULD HELP YOU TO REDUCE THE TIME NEEDED TO DEVELOP A PROPOSAL TO IMPROVE THE WAY BEE KEEPING IS MANAGED 
21:16:29 IN FREMONT.
WE HAVE PLAYED THIS ROLE REPEATEDLY WORKING CLOSELY WITH VARIOUS CITIES.

21:16:35 FOR EXAMPLE, SINCE APRIL WE COOPERATED WITH THE WITH ALAMEDA COUNTY SHERIFF IN UNINCORPORATED ALAMEDA COUNTY, 
21:16:42 WHICH HAS AN EFFECTIVE BAN ON BEE KEEPING.
OUR BACKGROUND REPORT HELPED STAFF 
21:16:47 DECIDE WHAT POLICY DHE WANTED TO PUT FORWARD.
COUNTY STAFF ARE CURRENTLY  GUIDING 
21:16:54 THE SHERIFFS PROPOSAL THROUGH THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS AND WE HOPE IT WILL COME TO A FINAL VOTE SOON.

21:17:04 IN SAN MATEO COUNTY IN MAY A FOSTER CITY COUNSELOR CHAMPIONED THEIR BAN ON BEE KEEPING.

21:17:13 GIVEN THEIR HEAVY WORK PLAN, WE WERE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE INFORMATION NEEDED IN SHORT ORDER.

21:17:21 THIS REDUCED THEIR EXPECTED STAFF TIME CAN TO WORK ON THIS ITEM TO ONE DAY.
THE COUNCIL EXPRESSED CONSIDERABLE 
21:17:27 SUPPORT FOR OVERTURNING THE BAN AND VOTED TO AGENDIZE THIS ITEM WITH A FINAL VOTE EXPECTED IN THE FALL.

21:17:47 WE WERE PLEASED TO LEARN RECENTLY EVER COUNCILOR JENNIE KASSAN'S PROPOSAL TO REVIEW STAFF WHICH IS UNDER REGULATION 
21:17:56 6.40.040 WHICH ARE VERY ONEROUS AND ALLOW ONLY A FEW CITY RESIDENTS TO KEEP BEES.

21:18:06 ONLY HOUSEHOLDS WITH MORE THAN  6,000 SQUARE FOOT LOTS CAN KEEP BEES RANGING FROM ONLY ONE HONEY BEE COLONY TO A 
21:18:12 MAXIMUM OF FIVE FOR A HALF ACRE LOT.
FURTHERMORE THE PERMITTING PROCESS IS VERY EXPENSIVE.

21:18:24 WE URGE YOU TO AUTHORIZE A BEE KEEPING REGULATION TONIGHT AND URGE FREMONT TO BECOME A BEFRIENDLY CITY.

21:18:28 THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.
THE NEXT SPEAKER IS JOHN HINES.

21:18:37 >> HELLO EVERYONE.
AT THE VERY LEAST WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO GRAND FATHER IN ANIMALS WHO ARE 
21:18:45 ALREADY HERE BEFORE THE RULE CHANGE.
BUT ON THE GENERAL TOPIC OF LIVESTOCK IN FREMONT THE FIRST THINGS COME TO 
21:18:50 MIND INVOLVE SMELL NOISE AND DISEASE FACTORS.
TO RECKON WITH THAT A LITTLE  BIT, 
21:19:02 WHEN I FIRST MOVED TO MY FIRST HOUSE I FOUND POOP IN MY FRONT YARD AND FOUND WOW, ROUGH NEIGHBORS, IT TURNS OUT TO 
21:19:07 BE SKUNKS, WHO CAN POOP WHEREVER THEY DAMN WELL
PLEASE.

21:19:14 THEY CAN PRODUCE POWERFUL SMELL THAT CARRIES GREAT DISTANCES AND THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN DO FOR  IT.

21:19:30 AS FOR DISEASE VECTORS, WE HAVE MOSQUITOES, AND AS FOR NOISE, ANY HOUR OF THE DAY, YOU CAN HEAR THE BARK OF 
21:19:38 ARGUMENTIVE SQUIRRELS, OR AT THE INSIST ENTS NAG OF CROWS.
SO IT IS NOT AS THOUGH WE WERE 
21:19:43 STARTING FROM A BASELINE OF ZERO WHIT COMES TO NOISE OR DISEASE VECTORS OR SMELL.

21:19:51 WE HAVE THOSE ALREADY FROM WILD ANIMALS BUT WE ALSO HAVE BEAUTIFUL SONG BIRDS AND THAT'S PART OF THE CHARM, PART OF 
21:19:58 THE PACKAGE, LIVING IN A HAPPY SUBURBAN COMMUNITY LIKE FREMONT AND NOT SOME BLEAK

21:20:04 CONCRETE  HELL-SCAPE LIKE SAN FRANCISCO.
SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT ADDING LIFE 
21:20:10 STOCK TO THE PICTURE THE DIFFERENCES ARE GOING TO BE LARGELY A MATTER OF DEGREE AND WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO MANAGE 
21:20:14 THEM QUANTITATIVELY WITH SIMPLE NUMBERS LIKE
POPULATION LIMITS.

21:20:23 HERE IS HOW MANY GOATS YOU CAN HAVE, HOW MANY HENS, HOW MANY ROOSTERS, AND FOR ROOSTERS MAYBE THE APPROPRIATE 
21:20:29 LIMIT IS ZERO IF YOU THINK ROOSTERS ARE ACTUALLY LOUDER THAN OUR CROWS WHICH I'M NOT SURE

21:20:34 ABOUT.
SET BACK, 15 FEET FROM THE PROPERTY LINE TO INSULATE YOUR NEIGHBORS FROM 
21:20:41 SOUND AND SMELL.
MINIMUM LOT SIZE FOR LARGER ANIMALS LIKE GOATS IN FAIRNESS TO THE ANIMALS 
21:20:47 AND THE  NEIGHBORS.
THERE ARE OTHER NUMBERS AND RULES WE CAN TRY BUT WE WOULD HAVE TO QUACH OUT 
21:20:56 FOR MORE COMPLEX ENFORCEMENT, BEST TO STICK WITH THE MOST EASILY VERIFIABLE NUMBERS, KEEP THOSE LOW AS A WAY TO 
21:21:00 MANAGE
DOWNWARD THE OTHER CONCERNS.
I THINK WE CAN MAKE THIS WORK.

21:21:12 THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU, THE NEXT SPEAKER IS ELKA, WELCOME.

21:21:24 >> GOOD EVENING, COUNCILMEMBERS, MY NAME IS ELKA HADLEY, MY NAME IS SHASHONNA CHITTLE.

21:21:36 I LIVE WITH MY MOM MY DAD MY BROTHER AND MY GOATS NADIA AND BUTTERCUP.
I JUST WANT TO SAY IF NADIA AND 
21:21:41 BUTTERCUP WERE MOVED, MY GREAT GRANDPARENTS WOULD BE VERY DISAPPOINTED.

21:21:53 I MOVED HERE FROM OHIO SO THEIR KIDS GRAND KIDS AND GREAT GRAND KIDS COULD LEARN TO GROW THEIR OWN FOOD.

21:22:01 I'M TAKING MY 4H PIG TO SCHOOL TOMORROW SO MY FRIENDS CAN BENEFIT FROM MY PIG.

21:22:08 I DRIEMED ABOUT HAVING BABY GOATS AND I HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT HOW TO TAKE CARE OF MY GOATS FOR A YEAR SO IF MY 
21:22:13 GOATS WERE TAKEN AWAY AI WOULD BE FOREVER DISAPPOINTED AND IF MY TWO BEST FRIENDS WERE

21:22:22 GONE.
AND I HAVE THE EXPERIENCE AND I BELIEVE I SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO KEEP MY 
21:22:26 TWO GOALS.
I HAVE BEEN RESEARCHING HOW TO TAKE CARE OF GOATS FOR TWO  YEARS.

21:22:47 THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU, ELKA.
NEXT SPEAKER IS SPENCER HADLE YNG.

21:23:05 >> HI, CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS, MY NAME IS SPENCER HADLEY, I'M  SHASHONNA'S HUSBAND AND ELKA'S DAD.

21:23:15 WE WERE TOLD THIS COULD BE TURNED INTO CONDOS OR IF WE WANTED TO FIX IT UP.
IF WE COULD MAKE THE WORLD BETTER IN 
21:23:24 SOME LITTLE WAY, WE'VE HAD MANY IDEAS OVER THE YEARS BUT WE'VE BEEN LEARNING ALONG THE WAY, WE'VE BEEN TRYING, 
21:23:28 BASICALLY EXPERIMENTING WITH THE THINGS WE'VE
LEARNED LIKE PER  MACULTURE AND 
21:23:37 CONVENTIONAL STYLES OF AGRICULTURE.
MY WIFE TALKED PASSIONATELY ABOUT THE TROUBLES AHEAD OF US AND WE SHOULDN'T 
21:23:44 BE CAVALIER ABOUT HOW GOOD THINGS HAVE BEEN FOR THE LAST 50 YEARS.
I'M NOT A PREPPER, I'M NOT DEPRESSED, 
21:23:52 I DON'T HAVE ISSUES, BUT I DO TAKE SERIOUSLY THE IDEA THAT OUR WORLD IS WARMING UP AND THAT WE ARE NOT IMMUNE 
21:23:58 FROM THESE ISSUES.
I AM ALL IN FAVOR OF GETTING ECONOMIC GROWTH DOWNTOWN.

21:24:03 I WANT TO GO TO A NICE, FUN DINNER TOO.
IT FEELS GREAT FOR A NIGHT AND I 
21:24:13 REALLY DO WANT THAT.
BUT WE ALSO I THINK TO BE A WHOLESOME REAL HUMAN PEOPLE, NEED TO BE THINKING 
21:24:21 IN LONG TERM WAYS.
NOT JUST 50 OR 100 OR 150 YEARS SINCE THE SETTLERS CAME BUT BEFORE THEN WHEN 
21:24:27 HUMANS WERE LIVING WITH THIS LAND IN A WAY THAT ALLOWED FOR MANY MORE SPECIES THAN LIVE HERE NOW.

21:24:34 THAT HAVE MORE SPECIES OF PLANTS AND ANIMALS.
SO I RECOMMEND THE FIRST CUSTOM CHANCE 
21:24:44 OF THE OHLONE WAY BY MALCOLM MARGOLIN WHO BRINGS TOGETHER THE FIRST WRITINGS OF SETTLERS WHO SAW THE BAY AREA 
21:24:50 BEFORE ANY SETTLEMENT HAD HAPPENED AND MADE
RECORDS OF BIRDS BLACKENING OUT THE 
21:24:57 SKIES AND GRIZZLY BEARS AND ELK AND A DECREE AMOUNT OF ANIMAL AND WE'RE NEVER GOING TO GET QUITE BACK TO THERE 
21:25:05 BUT WE NEED TO KNOW THAT IT'S POSSIBLE TO HAVE A MORE
-- A FULLER ECOLOGY IN THIS AREA.

21:25:13 IT IS POSSIBLE.
THIS IS NOT THE WAY THAT WE WERE BORN INTO THIS LAND, IT'S NOT ITS TRUE 
21:25:19 POTENTIAL.
WE CAN DO BETTER AND TO UNDERSTAND THE PHILOSOPHICAL UNDERPINNINGS OF THIS 
21:25:30 ECOLOGY I RECOMMEND READING SAND TALK BY TYSON YONKAPURTA, HE TALKS ABOUT THE STYLE OF PHILOSOPHICAL THINKING 
21:25:37 THAT CAN
-- THAT WE'RE NOT IN TOUCH WITH YET.
ALL I WANT TO BE ABLE TO DO IS HAVE 
21:25:43 THESE EXPERIMENTS SO WE CAN FIGURE OUT HOW TO LIVE BETTER ON THIS EARTH BECAUSE I DON'T FEEL WE HAVE ALL THE 
21:25:49 ANSWERS YET.
THANKS FOR YOUR TIME.
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU THE NEXT 
21:25:59 SPEAKER IS DENNIS CHITTLE, WELCOME.
>> OKAY.
AM I ON NOW?

21:26:03 >> Mayor Mei:   YES YOU ARE, THANK YOU SIR.
>> OKAY GREAT, I WANT TO THANK 
21:26:11 EVERYBODY FOR COMING TO THE DEFENSE OF MY DAUGHTER AND SON-IN-LAW AND GRANDDAUGHTER.

21:26:17 AND ALL THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE A LOT OF SYMPATHY FOR THESE LITTLE GOATS.
BUT I JUST WANT TO BRING UP ONE POINT, 
21:26:28 TOO, IS THAT THIS PIECE OF PROPERTY IS NOT YOUR AVERAGE FOUR OR FIVE, 6,000 SQUARE FOOT LOT.

21:26:35 WHEN MY PARENTS BOUGHT IT 58 YEARS AGO, IT WAS OVER THREE QUARTERS OF AN ACRE.

21:26:41 THE ONLY THING AROUND IT WAS A CORNFIELD AND THEN THERE WAS THE SHIN HOUSE.

21:26:52 AND ON THE OTHER SIDE WAS APRICOT ORCHARDS WHICH IS NOW THE WATER DISTRICT.

21:27:02 OVER THE COURSE OF THE YEARS, THE PROPERTY'S A LITTLE SMALLER NOW, IT'S ONLY ABOUT TWO-THIRDS OF AN ACRE 
21:27:08 BECAUSE THE CITY PUT IN SIDEWALKS AND WIDENED PERALTA AND MOWRY TO FOUR LANES AND TOOK ABOUT A

21:27:18 QUARTER OF AN ACRE IN FRONT.
AND ON THE OTHER SIDE, THE WATER DISTRICT TOOK OVER, KILLED ALL THE 
21:27:24 APRICOT TREES AND REALLY KIND OF POISONED THE LAND WITH THEIR SALTWATER.

21:27:32 KILLED ONE OF MY CHERRY TREES.
BUT THEY ALSO HAVE AN EASEMENT ON THAT SIDE OF THE PROPERTY THAT RUNS WHERE 
21:27:44 THEY'VE GOT PIPING AND THERE'S ALSO DRAINAGE FOR THEIR DESALTATION PLANT.
I JUST WANT TO MAKE THE POINT THAT 
21:27:54 THIS PROPERTY IS SURROUNDED BY FREE SPACE.
AND ONLY HAS A COMMUNITY ON ONE SIDE.

21:28:08 AND ALL THE NEIGHBORS SIGNED A PETITION SAYING THAT THEY HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH THIS PROPERTY.

21:28:14 IN FACT THERE'S A BIG FENCE, IF MY CHILDREN DIDN'T ALLOW PEOPLE IN NO ONE WOULD EVEN KNOW ITS THERE.

21:28:24  IT'S THERE.
I THINK THE REAL POINT IS, IS THAT SINCE THIS PROPERTY IS NOT YOUR 
21:28:34 TYPICAL SMALL RANCH STYLE HOUSE, THAT IT SHOULD JUST BE GRANDFATHERED IN.
MY DAD FARMED IT WHEN WE BOUGHT THE 
21:28:42 HOUSE IT HAD CHICKENS IN IT.
THEY DIDN'T EVEN HAVE A COOP.
THEY USED TO SLEEP IN THE APRICOT 
21:28:48 TREES AT NIGHT.
MY DAD ALWAYS HAD CHICKENS.
HE HAD RABBITS.

21:29:07 WE HAD A GOAT THERE WHEN I WAS A KID.
THINGS HAVE CHANGED AND STUFF AND -- AND --

21:29:16 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.
NEXT SPEAKER IS SONIA KHAN.
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH, MADAM MAYOR.

21:29:25 CITY COUNCIL, THIS IS SONIA KHAN SPEAKING, HUMAN RELATIONS COMMISSION.
I'M SPEAKING ON MY OWN BEHALF.

21:29:32 AFTER LISTENING TO THIS  EVENING'S COMMENTS I JUST WANTED TO SAY I THINK YOU SHOULD PARDON THE GOATS.

21:29:45 THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.
NEXT SPEAKER IS NAREN OR NAREN  
21:29:52 IMADI.
>> HI, GOOD EVENING CREDIT EVERYONE.
MY NAME NAREN IMADI.

21:30:09 I'M RESIDENT OF NILES CHRISTIAN CREDIT NEIGHBORHOOD.
I'M HERE TO EXTEND MY TO KEEP MORE 
21:30:18 GOATS AS PART OF THEIR LIVE STOCK.
IN FACT THIS IS THE TIME TO DO THE RIGHT THING.

21:30:26 IF THE REASON TO NOT ALLOW GOATS  IS FREMONT GOING MORE URBAN AND DENSE, IT WILL IN FACT A BETTER REASON TO HAVE 
21:30:31 MORE GOATS TO MAKE PLACE FEEL LESS DENSE.
IF NOT WE REVERSE IT.

21:30:41 ALSO, I REQUEST THE ANIMAL SERVICES TO HAVE TRANSPARENCY IN MAKING SURE THAT ANY CHANGES TO THESE ORDINANCES ARE 
21:30:46 BROUGHTING PUBLIC UP FRONT IN ORDER TO MAKE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THE REASON BEHIND THESE

21:30:52 CHANGES.
SO THAT THEY WON'T BE A SURPRISE TO THE RESIDENTS WHO ARE APPLYING FOR NEW 
21:30:59 PERMITS OR APPLYING TO RENEW THEIR EXISTING PERMITS.
IN MY PERSONAL OPINION WE SHOULD GIVE 
21:31:06 MORE OPTIONS TO RESIDENTS TO KEEP LIVESTOCK.
UNLESS THERE IS A SPECIFIC NEGATIVE 
21:31:16 IMPACT TO THE EXISTING ECOLOGY AROUND THIS PLACE.
PLEASE ALLOW THE CHITTLE FAMILY TO 
21:31:24 KEEP THEIR MINIATURE GOATS NADIA AND BUTTERCUP ON THEIR PROPERTY.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.

21:31:31 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU, RICHARD, I THINK YOU ALREADY SPOKE, I APOLOGIZE, YOU CAN ONLY SPEAK ONCE FOR COMMENTS, 
21:31:35 I WANTED TO MAKE SURE.
I'M GOING TO TURN IT IMPACT TO THE COUNCIL FOR COMMENTS.

21:31:41 I'M GOING TO BEGIN WITH COUNCILMEMBER JONES.
I'M GOING TO CLOSE THE PUBLIC COMMENT 
21:31:47 AGAIN, AS I MENTIONED.
COUNCILMEMBER JONES.
>> Councilmember Jones:   THANK YOU, 
21:31:56 MADAM MAYOR.
I KNOW WE HAVE CHIEF PETERSEN ON THE CALL HERE.

21:32:05 I WORCHED IF SHE HAS A PERSPECTIVE ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE.
>> Chief Petersen:   YES, THANK YOU, 
21:32:10 COUNCILMEMBER JONES.
ACTUALLY OUR DEPARTMENT IN COOPERATION WITH THE CITY ATTORNEY'S OFFICE WE DID 
21:32:21 A REVIEW OF THE MUNI CODE, THE CHAPTER THAT COVERS THE ANIMAL OWNERSHIP.
THE CHANGES IN THE MUNI CODE IN 2018 
21:32:29 WERE THROUGHOUT THAT ENTIRE CHAPTER.
THAT CHAPTER IN THE CODE HAD NOT BEEN UPDATED SINCE 1976 AND OF COURSE 
21:32:34 FREMONT IS SIMPLY A DIFFERENT PLACE AND TIMES HAVE CHANGED SO IT REALLY WAS JUST TIME FOR AN UPDATE.

21:32:44 SO THE GOAT ORDINANCE IN PARTICULAR WAS PART OF THAT LARGER UPDATE.
NOW ANYONE WHO OWNED GROATS AT THAT 
21:32:54 TIME AND HAD GOATS  PERMITTED AT THAT TIME, THEY WERE PERMITTED IN.
THE CHITTLE FAMILY DID NOT HAVE GOATS 
21:33:00 AT THAT TIME, WHEN WE WENT TO DO OUR INSPECTION FOR OUR OTHER ANIMALS THIS YEAR THEY DID HAVE THE GOATS AND SO 
21:33:03 THEY WERE INFORMED AT THE TIME THAT GOATS WERE NO
LONGER ALLOWED.

21:33:12 HOWEVER, SINCE THAT TIME, WE HAVE GRANTED THE CHITTLE FAMILY AN EDUCATIONAL EXEMPTION SO THEY DO NOW 
21:33:23 HAVE PERMISSION TO KEEP THE GOATS.
WE SIMPLY FOUND THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO SHOW THAT HEEM SCHOOLING THE KIDS IT 
21:33:30 WAS PART OF THE EDUCATIONAL PROCESS.
I THINK THAT PARTICULAR CASE HAS BEEN RESOLVED.

21:33:36 I KNOW MANY MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY HAVE SPOKEN OUT TONIGHT BUT THEY DO NOW HAVE ALREADY PERMISSION TO DO THAT.

21:33:45 NOW ON THE BROADER TOPIC IF THE PUBLIC AND THE COUNCILMEMBERS TRULY FEEL THAT ADDING GOATS, GOAT OWNERSHIP BACK TO 
21:33:52 THE CODE IS IMPORTANT, THAT IS CERTAINLY SOMETHING WE CAN LOOK AT.
YOU KNOW WE WOULD WANT TO PUT IN BEST 
21:34:02 PRACTICES IN TERMS OF SIZE OF THE PROPERTY, GENDER OF THE GOATS, ET CETERA, SEX OF THE GOATS, ET CETERA.

21:34:10 WE'RE CERTAINLY WILLING TO BE OPEN TO THAT.
THIS TOPIC HAS NOT COME UP SINCE 
21:34:14 2018.
WE HAVE NOT HAD OTHER ISSUES WITH FOLKS IN THE COMMUNITY  WANTING DO OWN 
21:34:19 GOATS.
BUT THAT'S NOT SOMETHING WE ARE OPPOSED TO.

21:34:25 WE CAN MAKE THAT WORK.
I DON'T KNOW THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A RUSH ON GOAT OWNERSHIP BUT WE'RE 
21:34:34 DEFINITELY WILLING TO HELP DEVELOP A CHANGE.
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU, 
21:34:37 COUNCILMEMBER JONES.
DID YOU HAVE ANYTHING DO ADD TO THAT?
>> Councilmember Jones:   NO OOTHER 
21:34:41 QUESTIONS.
I'LL RESERVE MY QUESTIONS UNTIL LATER, THANK YOU.

21:34:45 >> Mayor Mei:   COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN DO YOU HAVE QUESTIONS?
>> Councilmember Salwan:   CAN YOU 
21:34:49 HEAR ME?
>> Mayor Mei:   YES I CAN.
>> Councilmember Salwan:   FUNNY ABOUT 
21:34:53 DID CHIEF, WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE EVERYBODY RUSHING TO GET THEIR OWN GOAT.

21:34:58 BUT THE QUESTION BY COUNCILMEMBER JONES I REALLY APPRECIATE THE CHIEF ANSWERING THAT BECAUSE I DID NOT 
21:35:02 REALIZE THAT THERE WAS AN EXEMPTION GIVEN ALREADY.
SO THAT'S GOOD.

21:35:13 THAT THEY CAN KEEP THEIR GOATS.
GOATS ARE PRETTY MILD ANIMALS ESPECIALLY THESE MINI GOATS.

21:35:19 THEY'RE KIND OF COOL, FOLLOW YOU AROUND KIND OF LIKE DOGS IN A WAY.
THEY DON'T MAKE A BIG MESS OR ANYTHING 
21:35:30 SO I'M OPEN TO EXPLORING THIS.
THAT'S WHY I SUPPORT COUNCILMEMBER KENG'S REEFERL.

21:35:39 HOPEFULLY WE DON'T DO IT PIECEMEAL, WE CAN THINK ABOUT OTHER ISSUES THAT COME UP, URBAN AGRICULTURE AND LIVESTOCK SO 
21:35:46 IT'S NOT AONE OFF THING.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR FEEDBACK CHIEF AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR REFERRAL 
21:35:49 COUNCILMEMBER KENG.
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN.

21:35:57 I WANT TO COMMENT FOR THE PUBLIC THE PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD IS CLOSED AND AGENDA ITEMS YOU CAN ONLY SPEAK ONCE 
21:36:02 ON THE AGENDA ITEM.
I WANTED TO CLARIFY NAP NOW AT THIS TIME IT'S TURNED TO OUR COUNCILMEMBERS 
21:36:12 FOR BOTH QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME AND THEN COMMENTS.
COUNCILMEMBER SHAO, VICE MAYOR SHAO IS 
21:36:19 NEXT, I'M TRYING TO SEE ON MY LIST.
>> Councilmember Shao:   THANK YOU, MADAM MAYOR.

21:36:27 I'M VERY GLAD THAT THIS ISSUE HAS BEEN RESOLVED AND I IN GENERAL WOULD SUPPORT COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN'S 
21:36:39 REFERRAL TO REVIEW OUR POLICY, ESPECIALLY FOR THE BEES.
I KNOW THAT BEES NOW ARE THE  
21:36:50 ENDANGERED SPECIES IN  CALIFORNIA, ESPECIALLY.
WITH TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THEIR 
21:36:59 CONTRIBUTION TO OUR AGRICULTURE AND FRUIT INDUSTRY.
IT IS VERY, VERY IMPORTANT.

21:37:06 SO THAT CERTAINLY IS SOMETHING THAT IS WORTH LOOKING AT.
BUT I JUST ALSO WANT TO CAUTION WHEN 
21:37:15 WE REVIEW THE POLICY, WE REALLY HAVE TO LIKE WHAT THE PUBLIC SPEAKER JUST MENTIONED, THE NOISE, SMELL, AS WELL 
21:37:21 AS THE THE DISEASE FACTORS THAT WE HAVE TO TAKE INTO
CONSIDERATION.

21:37:34 FORTUNATELY, I DON'T SEE BEES OR OGOATS EVEN ARE HAVING THOSE FACTORS.
 HOWEVER IF YOU TALK ABOUT PIGS, THAT 
21:37:44 COULD CERTAINLY YOU KNOW GET INTO CERTAIN CONTROVERSIAL AREA.
SO IN GENERAL I'M IN SUPPORT OF THE 
21:37:56  THIS REFERRAL.
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU, COUNCILMEMBER KENG.

21:38:04 >> Councilmember Keng:   THANK YOU.
I DO APPRECIATE COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN BRINGING UP THIS REFERRAL AND I 
21:38:12 APPRECIATE ALL THE SPEAKERS THAT CAME TO SPEAK TONIGHT, GLAD TO HEAR WE HAVE AN EXEMPTION GRANTED FOR NADIA AND 
21:38:17 BUTTERCUP.
I THINK IT IS HELPFUL THAT WE ALSO HAVE COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN WHO IS A 
21:38:25 VETERINARIAN ON OUR COUNCIL, SO I THINK HE HAS A LOT OF KNOWLEDGE ABOUT ANIMALS AND, YOU KNOW, LIKE WE WERE 
21:38:35 SAYING WHICH ANIMALS
ARE -- COULD BE CONSIDERED AS DOMESTIC PETS AND GOOD FOR OUR ENVIRONMENT.

21:38:43 SO I DO SUPPORT THIS REFERRAL AND I THINK WE CAN TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT -- IF WE SHOULD REVISIT WHAT ANIMALS CAN BE 
21:38:50 ALLOWED.
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.
I JUST SAW ON THE TOP OF MY LIST 
21:38:53 COUNCILMEMBER JONES.
DO YOU HAVE YOUR HAND RAISED AGAIN I GUESS?

21:38:59 BECAUSE I WANT TO CLARIFY THE PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD IS CLOSED WHICH MEANS THAT THERE ARE NO ADDITIONAL PUBLIC 
21:39:03 COMMENTS AT THIS TIME SO WE'RE JUST GOING TO TURN IT BACK TO OUR COUNCIL.
SO --

21:39:07 >> Councilmember Jones:   SO I'LL MAKE A COUPLE OF CLOSING COMMENTS FOR MYSELF.

21:39:12 >> Mayor Mei:   THERE ARE A COUPLE OF SPEAKERS FOLLOWING YOU BUT GO AHEAD.
>> Councilmember Jones:   FROM THE 
21:39:17 PUBLIC OR --
>> Mayor Mei:   COUNCIL.
IF YOU'RE MAKING A MOTION THERE'S 
21:39:21 OTHER PEOPLE ON --
>> Councilmember Jones:   NO I'M NOT MAKING A MOTION.

21:39:26 I'LL LEAVE IT TO COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, IT'S HER REFERRAL.
I'M IN AGREEMENT WITH MOST OF THE 
21:39:34 COUNCIL HERE.
I DO THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE LOCATION OF THE 
21:39:39 RESIDENCE, THE SIZE OF THE LOT AVAILABLE, ALL OF THOSE KINDS OF THINGS.

21:39:48 I APPRECIATE MR. HINES SOUND EFFECTS.
THAT KIND OF BROUGHT EVERYTHING TO LIFE.

21:39:55 BUT HE BROUGHT UP A LOT OF GOOD POINTS, THE SETBACKS AND WHAT'S FAIR TO THE ANIMAL ITSELF, REGARDLESS OF WHAT KIND 
21:40:01 OF ANIMAL IT IS.
IT IS A VERY DIFFERENT CITY THAN IT WAS WHEN I STARTED IN 1979.

21:40:06 MOST OF THE SOUTH END OF THE CITY WAS ALL FARMLAND.
THERE WERE A LOT OF GOATS, A LOT OF 
21:40:13 SHEEP, A LOT OF CATTLE AND WE HAVE URBANIZED AND A LOT OF THOSE HAVE MOVED OUT.

21:40:19 IS IT APPROPRIATE TO BRING THOSE BACK INTO A RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD?
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO 
21:40:22 CONSIDER AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO LOOK AT WHAT OTHER CITIES ARE ALLOWING.

21:40:29 BUT I THINK THIS IDEA OF URBAN FARMING, WE ALREADY ALLOW URBAN AGRICULTURE FARMING IN A LOT OF OUR BUSINESSES.

21:40:35 THERE ARE A COUPLE DOWN IN THE BAYSIDE PARKWAY DEVELOPMENT.
SO YOU KNOW I DON'T HAVE AN ISSUE WITH 
21:40:41 IT.
I THINK WE NEED TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT EXACTLY WHAT IS IT WE ARE GOING TO 
21:40:46 ALLOW AND WHATEVER OTHER RESTRICTIONS WE NEED TO PUT IN PLACE SO THAT ALL OF A SUDDEN WE DON'T HAVE PEOPLE KEEPING 
21:40:52 HORSES OR
OTHER TYPES OF EXOTIC ANIMALS THAT REALLY DON'T BELONG IN A RESIDENTIAL 
21:40:57 NEIGHBORHOOD.
IT'S NOT FAIR TO THE ANIMAL EITHER.
SO I THINK AS LONG AS WE GO FORWARD 
21:41:03 WITH THIS WE LOOK AT SOME OF THE OTHER CITIES ARE DOING AND FOLLOW SOME OF THOSE GUIDELINES AND I'M FULLY 
21:41:08 SUPPORTIVE OF READDRESSING THE ORDINANCE.
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

21:41:14 COUNCILMEMBER COX AND THEN I'LL MAKE COMMENTS BEFORE I TURN IT OVER TO COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN TO MAKE A MOTION, 
21:41:20 I THINK.
>> Councilmember Cox:   FIRST OFF I'M SO HAPPY THAT NADIA AND BUTTERCUP WILL 
21:41:24 REMAIN WILL FAMILY.
PETS ARE FAMILY AND IT IS SO IMPORTANT.

21:41:28 I REALLY APPRECIATE COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN BRINGING THIS TO OUR ATTENTION.

21:41:38 ALSO, ON ANOTHER NOTE, I KNOW THAT IN WORKING IN PUBLIC PROCUREMENT THERE IS THE OFFICE OF SUSTAINABILITY FOR 
21:41:46 ALAMEDA COUNTY, AND THEY WORK IN PARALLEL WITH ALL THE OTHER COUNTIES AND

21:41:54 LOOKING AT WAYS TO BE ABLE TO USE LIVESTOCK BUT IT IS IN A WAY THAT WOULD BE FOR WEED ABATEMENT AND 
21:42:02 CURRENTLY AS WE MAY DRIVE THROUGH THE DISTRICT 6, THE SENSATIONAL DISTRICT 6, THAT WE DO HAVE

21:42:09 GRIMMER AND BLACOW THAT WE DO HAVE A LOT OF GOAT GRAZING THAT'S HAPPENING AS WELL.

21:42:19 BECAUSE IT'S HELPING TO REDUCE PREVENTION OF FIRE AROUND OUR HOMES.
AND SO I KNOW THAT A LOT OF THE THINGS 
21:42:26 WITH THE OFFICE OF ALAMEDA COUNTY SUSTAINABILITY AND WITH CONJUNCTION, I KNOW THEY USE A LOT OF OUR COUNTY OF 
21:42:32 SANTA CLARA CONTRACTS.
AND SOME OF THE THINGS THEY PULL OUT IS THAT THEY'RE ALWAYS MAKING SURE 
21:42:43  WHENEVER THEY HAVE ANIMALS THEY ARE HEALTHY, YOU NEED TO PROVIDE THE NORMAL CERTIFICATES AND

21:42:50 MAKING SURE THEY ARE DISEASE FREE AND CERTIFYING THAT AND MAKING SURE THAT THE WONDERFUL LITTLE GOAT PETS ARE 
21:43:01 ALSO IN A SECURED  FENCING AREA.
SO THEY DON'T GET OUT AND  WANDER.
BUT ALSO, THAT IT REALLY AS A MOTHER 
21:43:09 HAVING AND HOSTING LITTLE MINIATURE FARM PARTIES, THE LITTLE ZOO PARTIES THAT COME TO YOUR HOME AND THEY BRING 
21:43:14 THEM ALL IN A LITTLE VAN AND OF COURSE THEY ALWAYS
BRING  ADORABLE GOATS AND THE KIDS 
21:43:23 JUST GO WILD IN PELTING THEM.
AND SO I COULD SEE THAT NADIA AND BUTTERCUP BEING VERY LOVED BY ELKA 
21:43:29 THERE.
I JUST THINK AS WE DO THIS REVIEWING IF WE CAN ALSO BESIDES LOOKING AT 
21:43:36 CITIES BUT COUNTY WOULD BE A GREAT SOURCE OF COLLECTIVE OF INFORMATION ON SUSTAINABILITY AND WORKING WITH 
21:43:44 LIVESTOCK BUT ALSO
OTHER TYPES OF INVENTIONS OF MAYBE INNOVATIONS OF EITHER BEES AND OTHER 
21:43:56 THINGS THAT WOULD HELP US KEEP OUR CLIMATE CLEAN AND BEING ABLE TO BE ENVIRONMENTALLY DISPRENDLY TO REDUCE 
21:44:03 ANY TYPE OF USE OF
CHEMICALS OR ANYTHING THAT WOULD HARM IF ENVIRONMENT BY USING SOME FORM OF 
21:44:10 ACCEPTABLE AND PROVEN PRACTICES THAT ARE GOING ON AT OUR COUNTY LEVEL.
SO JUST OFFERING THAT AS ANOTHER 
21:44:18 SOURCE OF SUSTAINABILITY THAT DOES DEAL WITH LIVESTOCK, THAT DOES DEAL WITH HOW WE PROTECT OUR ENVIRONMENT BUT 
21:44:25 WE'RE DOING THINGS USING WHAT NATURE HAS AND WHAT FORMS
OF TYPES OF ANIMALS AND THINGS THAT 
21:44:31 WOULD BE ACCEPTABLE.
AND ALSO, BEING INNOVATIVE TO SEE IF THERE'S OTHER THINGS THAT WE CAN BE 
21:44:38 OPEN TO THAT WE HAVE NOT CONSIDERED THAT ARE ON SOME NEW TRENDS BUT CHECKING WITH SANTA CLARA COUNTY, AND 
21:44:44 WITH ALAMEDA COUNTY,
WOULD BE SOME GREAT PRACTICES THERE.
SINCE THERE'S A LOT OF PHARMACIST 
21:44:55 PLANNED AND WHILE YOU KNOW FARMLAND AROUND THAT -- THEY'RE USING AND PUTTING UNDER CONTRACT SUCH AS LIVING 
21:45:01 SYSTEMS ANIMAL MANAGEMENT THAT DOES WONDERFUL
THINGS WITH GOATS AND YOU HAVE OTHER 
21:45:10 TYPES OF SMALL ANIMALS THAT CAN BE USED FOR PREVENTION AND OTHER WAYS, AND TAKING CARE OF OUR PROPERTY, AND 
21:45:14 PROTECTING OUR ENVIRONMENT AND TRYING TO USE LESS
CHEMICALS.

21:45:20 BUT USING THINGS THAT ARE NATURE AND AVAILABLE TO HELP US.
SO -- BUT THANK YOU.

21:45:29 I REALLY APPRECIATE CHIEF  PETERSEN AND HER STAFF TO LOOK THROUGH THIS AND GET ANSWERS BACK.

21:45:36 I JUST WAS NOT AWARE UNTIL YOU JUST MENTIONED THIS EVENING THAT THERE WAS AN EXCEPTION GRANTED.

21:45:43 I'M VERY HAPPY ABOUT THAT, THAT'S A WIN-WIN FOR THE COMMUNITY, WIN-WIN FOR HELPING ALL OF FREMONT.

21:45:52 SO APPRECIATE SOME NEW THINGS THAT ARE COMING DOWN THE LINE FOR YOUR REVIEW TO TAKE A LOOK AND SOME FORMS OF 
21:45:58  SUSTAINABILITY.
THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei:   SO I'M GOING TO SHARE 
21:46:05 SOME THINGS REAL QUICK BEFORE WE GO.
THANK YOU COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN FOR BRINGING THIS ITEM BEFORE  US.

21:46:12 I KNOW MANY PEOPLE HAD WRITTEN TO US AND WE WERE AWARE, I WAS WORKING WITH THE CHIEF AND THEIR TEAM AND ANIMAL 
21:46:19 SERVICES IN REGARDS TO THIS TOPIC AS WELL AS FOLLOWING UP WITH WHAT THE CURRENT STATUS IS.

21:46:24 I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE SOMETHING THAT IS GOING TO BE HELPFUL ON THE EDUCATIONAL FRONT.

21:46:33 I DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO LOOK AT THIS HOLISTICALLY AND WE ARE UPDATING OUR CLIMATE ACTION PLAN AND 
21:46:40 SUSTAINABILITY.
I APPRECIATE OUR TEAM, THIS HAD FALLEN UNDER AN MALT SERVICES, PD BUT ALSO 
21:46:48 LAND USE.
I'M CURIOUS HOW THIS ROLLS OUT, I GREW UP ON PENNSYLVANIA, I I GREW UP ON MY 
21:46:57 OWN THREE QUARTERS OF AN ACRE.
THERE WAS NO PUNXSUTAWNEYTON PHIL, AND THE HOUSES ACROSS FROM ME WERE 200 
21:47:03 YEARS OLD WHERE FARMHOUSES AND THEIR OWN CHICKEN CANS AND HORSES AND GOATS AND MANY OTHER THINGS.

21:47:10 IT WAS A LITTLE DIFFERENT THOUGH BECAUSE THE LAND I GREW UP ON WAS SIGNIFICANTLY MORE OPEN AND MORE 
21:47:18 ACCESSIBLE FOR AGRICULTURE.
THAT WAS ALSO DURING THE 70s SO IT HAS BEEN A LITTLE WHILE AGO, I MOVED HERE 
21:47:25 27 YEARS AGO.
CERTAINLY FREMONT WENT THROUGH TRANSFORMATION DURING THIS PERIOD.

21:47:31 WE TRIED TO UTILIZE GOATS WHERE IT WAS POSSIBLE FOR OUR VEGETATION AN WEED ABATEMENT.

21:47:43 AS WE LOOK AT CREDIT ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY WAYS TO DEAL WITH IT, WE OLOVE TO SEE IF THERE ARE WAYS THAT WE 
21:47:48 CAN ADDRESS HOW WE CAN LOOK AT URBAN AGRICULTURE.
IT IS SOMETHING THAT IS  INTERESTING 
21:47:51 IN TERMS OF WHAT OPTIONS ARE AVAILABLE.
DO I THINK THAT FROM THE PERSPECTIVE, 
21:47:59 I KNOW COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN ALSO SITS ON STOP WASTE AND SERVES ON THAT COMMISSION AND I'M HER ALTERNATE FOR 
21:48:03 THAT.
THERE ARE WAYS THAT WE CAN LOOK AT HOW TO ADDRESS THIS.

21:48:09 THIS IS BEGUNKING TO AN ONGOING CONCERN AS WE MOVE FORWARD AND WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOUSE TO ADDRESS VEGETATION 
21:48:18 AND THIS YEAR THERE'S NO EXCEPTION, FROM THE WILDFIRES.
FROM THE ANIMAL SERVICES DEPARTMENT, 
21:48:24 AND FROM COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, SHE'S GOING DO SPEAK NEXT BUT I WOULD IMAGINE SHE'S GOING TO LIKE TO TALK 
21:48:33 ABOUT SOME HOLISTIC LOOK.
FROM NADIA AND BUTTERCUP, FROM THE CONVERSATION THE SITUATION IS NOT 
21:48:38 ALONE.
I'M SUPPORTIVE OF THIS CONVERSATION AND MOVING FORWARD TO HAVE A BETTER 
21:48:45 SIGNALS AND UNDERSTANDING AND I'LL TURN IT TO YOU COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN TO SEE IF YOU HAVE A MOTION TO  MAKE.

21:48:50 >> Councilmember Kassan:   YES, THANK YOU.
I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT THERE HAD BEEN A 
21:48:55 TEMPORARY PERMIT GRANTED FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES.
I'M GLAD DO HEAR THAT HAPPENED.

21:49:02 BUT DO I THINK IT IS THE A -- THIS IS -- THIS WHAT HAPPENED WITH THIS PARTICULAR FAMILY I THINK IS A GOOD 
21:49:07 OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO LOOK AT THIS OFFENSE.
I THINK THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT 
21:49:22 HAPPENS SOMETIMES W WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENT, THE AMENDMENT GOES ON CONSENT CALENDAR.

21:49:28 I WASN'T ON COUNCIL AT THE TIME.
BUT WHO KNOWS IF I HAD BEEN, I MIGHT HAVE VOTED ON IT TOO.

21:49:36 BUT IT WAS OPRETTY COMPREHENSIVE CHANGE TO OUR RULES AROUND ANIMALS.
I THINK WE NEED TO BE A LITTLE MORE 
21:49:42 CAREFUL ABOUT MAKING BIG CHANGES TO ORDINANCES IN THE CITY AND NOT JUST TO GET ON CONSENT CALENDAR FOR SOMETHING 
21:49:48 SO BIG.
HOW WE DEAL WITH ANIMALS IN OUR CITY IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE AND IT DOES 
21:50:01 REALLY RELATE TO E ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES.
I GET A LOT OF CALLS ABOUT GAS POWER 
21:50:10 OD LEAF BLOWERS, COULD WE CONSIDER BANNING, THERE IS HESITATION THERE, WE DON'T HAVE RESOURCES TO ENFORCE A BAN 
21:50:20 LIKE THAT.
IT COULD ALSO HAVE REPERCUSSIONS ON LOCAL BUSINESSES.

21:50:29 THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS WE CAN MAKE THE ENVIRONMENT FRIENDLIER FOR FREMONT AND ALSO HONORING OUR AGRICULTURE 
21:50:32 HISTORY.
FREMONT HAS AN AMAZING AGRICULTURE HISTORY.

21:50:46 I WORKED ON THE BOARD OF LEAF FOR A WHILE AND WHEN YOU LEARN ABOUT WHAT THIS AREA WAS, I HOPE YOU WOULD WANT 
21:50:51 TO PRESERVE IT.
I HOPE WE HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE LOOK AT OUR ANIMAL ORDINANCE.

21:50:57 NOT JUST GOATS BUT BEES.
I HAVEN'T HEARD A PLOT OF COMPLAINTS FROM OUR BEE KEEPERS IN FREMONT 
21:51:04 BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S BECAUSE PEOPLE HAVEN'T EVEN CONSIDERED KEEPING BEES BECAUSE IT IS A BIT RESTRICTIVE ON HOW 
21:51:11 YOU CAN DO THAT.
SO I DO THINK IT IS SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE LOOKED AT COMPREHENSIVELY.

21:51:18 HOW WE CAN HAVE A REALLY COMPREHENSIVE ORDINANCE RELATED TO ANIMALS.
AND ALSO, YOU KNOW, I JUST DON'T THINK 
21:51:25 PEOPLE LIKE THE CHITTLE FAMILY SHOULD HAVE TO APPLY EVERY YEAR OR HOWEVER OFTEN THEY WOULD HAVE TO APPLY FOR 
21:51:31 THIS WAIVER OR THIS SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCE RELATED TO
EDUCATION AND YOU KNOW HAVE TO PROVE 
21:51:36 EVERY TIME THAT OH THIS REALLY IS EDUCATIONAL, I MEAN IT SHOULDN'T HAVE TO NECESSARILY BE EDUCATIONAL FOR 
21:51:42 PEOPLE TO KEEP GOATS.
THERE ARE LOTS OF BENEFITS OF GOATS BEYOND THE EDUCATIONAL PIECE LIKE THE 
21:51:49 MILK.
YOU KNOW, THE PICKING UP IN THE YARD.
SO ANYWAY YES, THANK YOU SO MUCH 
21:51:55 EVERYONE.
AGAIN IT MAKES ME SO HAPPY TO SEE PEOPLE COMING OUT SO LATE AND 
21:52:01 SUPPORTING THE NEIGHBORS.
AND WANTING TO REALLY PRESERVE THE AGRICULTURAL HISTORY OF OUR CITY.

21:52:08 AND REALLY SEE HOW WE CAN BE CLOSER TO NATURE EVEN THOUGH WE ARE AN URBANIZING CITY.

21:52:17 WITH THAT I'LL GO AHEAD AND MAKE THE MOTION.
>> Councilmember Cox:   SECOND.

21:52:25 
>> Councilmember Kassan:   TO ASK STAFF TO LOOK AT THE ISSUE AND COME 
21:52:34 FORWARD WITH ANOTHER CONDITION.
>> Mayor Mei:   SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER COX.

21:58:31 BE PRESENTED AND CONSIDERED AS PART OF
THE CELEBRATING JUNETEENTH AS A PAID CITY OF FREMONT HOLIDAY.

21:58:42 COMMENCING ON OR NEAR THE DATE OF JUNE THE 19th, 2022, AND THEREAFTER.
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

21:58:50 WE HAVE ONE PUBLIC SPEAKER ON THIS ITEM, JOHN HINES.
AND SONIA KHAN.

21:58:55 >> HELLO EVERYONE.
IT IS FITTING THAT WE HAVE THIS TOPIC COMING UP JUST A COUPLE OF DAYS AFTER 
21:59:01 WE CELEBRATE THE SIGNING OF THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE.
THAT DOCUMENT BEGAN LAYING OUTS THE 
21:59:07 CNS UNDER WHICH HUMANS TOLERATE GOVERNMENTS AND THAT'S WHEN GOVERNMENTS PROTECTOR OUR INDIVIDUAL 
21:59:14 RIGHTS, RIGHTS WHICH PROCEED GOVERNMENT, THE RIGHTS THEY CHOSE TO
MORRIS IN THAT DOCUMENT WAS LIFE, 
21:59:21 LIBERTY AND THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS.
THOSE PRINCIPLES AS BUILT PHENOMENON FURTHER IN THE CONSTITUTION WERE SOLID 
21:59:26 ENOUGH TO BE COPIED BY COUNTRY AFTER COUNTRY AROUND THE WORLD.
ALTHOUGH SOMETIMES FOR SHOW.

21:59:35 AND IN OUR OWN COUNTRY THERE WAS A GLARE INCONSISTENCY STARTING WITH THAT VERY DOCUMENT BECAUSE SOME STATES 
21:59:46 ALLOWED SLAVERY WHICH IS ABOUT AS FAR FROM LIBERTY AND THE PURSUIT OF  HAPPINESS THAT YOU CAN GET.

21:59:59 WE SEE THE WORDING WAS WATERED DOWN, BECAUSE SOME SLAVES SAW THAT MORE AGGRESSIVE WORDING WAS INFLAMMATORY.

22:00:06 89 YEARS LATER AFTER MUCH EFFORT AND MUCH SACRIFICE BY A GREAT MANY PEOPLE TROOPS FINALLY REACHED THE SOUTHERN 
22:00:15 MOST PARTS OF TEXAS AND ENDED SLAVERY, THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT
EVENTS IN THE COUNTRY'S HISTORY.

22:00:23 IT IS AT LEAST AS IMPORTANT AS SEVERAL OTHER HOLIDAYS WE CELEBRATE AND AS LONG AS THEY STILL BELONG ON THE LIST, 
22:00:32 JUNE 19th DOES TOO.
THERE IS A VALID DHEARN IT IS EASY TO CREATE NEW HOLIDAYS AND MAKE PEOPLE 
22:00:40 HAPPY AND GIVE THEM A NEW DAY OFF.
IF WE DO THAT FOREVER EVENTUALLY WE RUN OUT OF WORK DAYS.

22:00:47 IT IS GOOD TO SWAP THIS FOR A LESS IMPORTANT HOLIDAY, THERE ARE SOME BUT FOR NOW, LET'S ADD JUNETEENTH TO THE 
22:00:54 CALENDAR.
MY ONLY REMAINING SUGGESTIONS REGARDS THE NAME.

22:01:01 JUNETEENTH SPEAKS TO A SPOT ON THE CALENDAR AND FOR SUCH A SIGNIFICANT HOLIDAY IT WOULD BE BETTER TO NAME IT 
22:01:09 FOR ITS MEANING.
SOMETHING LIKE EARNED OF SLAVERY DAY, FREEDOM FROM SLAVERY DAY OR JUST 
22:01:23 FREEDOM DAY.
THAT WAY WE COULD HAVE A SOLID  WIN TWO THREE LINEUP, MEMORIAL DAY, 
22:01:30 FREEDOM DAY AND INDEPENDENCE DAY.
THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei:   NEXT SPEAKER, SONIA 
22:01:40 KHAN.
>> GOOD EVENING MAYOR, CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS, SONIA KHAN.

22:01:47 I WOULD LIKE TO THANK COUNCILMEMBER COX FOR BRINGING THIS REEFERL AND WOULD LIKE TO WHOLEHEARTED REPLY ENDORSE 
22:01:54 IT.
I WOULD REMIND THE COUNCIL THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL OF EFFORT LAST SUMMER INTO 
22:02:00 ADDRESSING HOW WE DEAL WITH THE DIFFICULT SORT OF DIVISIVE RACE ISSUES THAT WE HAVE BEEN FACING AND INCLUDING 
22:02:06 RIGHT HERE
IN FREMONT WITH SOME VERY CONTROVERSIAL ISSUES THAT HAVE COME 
22:02:17 UP.
I THINK THIS IS POTENTIALLY AN ACTUAL MEANINGFUL RATHER THAN PERFORMATIVE 
22:02:25 WAY, WHEN WE CALL OURSELVES A COMPASSIONATE SANCTION WEAR CITY AND WANTING TO UPHOLD THE HEALTH AND 
22:02:30 WELFARE OF ALL OUR
COMMUNITIES, THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT HOLIDAY THAT I DON'T NEED TO REPEAT 
22:02:35 THE HISTORY THAT'S ADMINISTRATOR BEEN EXPLAINED BUT WE WOULD BE ACTUALLY REMISS I THINK AT THIS POINT IN 
22:02:42 LETTING IT K GO.
EVERY DAY WE WAIT WOULD BE ONE DAY TOO LATE.

22:02:49 THIS YEAR IN YOUR LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES YOU DID ADD THAT SECTION FOR JUSTICE DIVERSITY EQUITY AND 
22:02:53 INCLUSION AND THIS WOULD BE A FANTASTIC PLACE TO START GIVEN FACT THAT IT ACTUALLY DOCUMENTS NOT

22:03:02 REALLY THE DAY THAT THE SLAVES WERE FREED BUT THE TWO YEAR LATE CESSATION OF HUMAN TRAFFICING THAT WENT AFTER 
22:03:12 SLAVERY WAS IN FACT CEASED AND DESISTED GOING ON IN THE STATE OF TEXAS A HUGE INJUSTICE.

22:03:19 IF WE ARE GOING TO LOOK FOR IDEAS TO SUPPORT AND BE CONSISTENT WITH OUR LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES WHERE JUSTICE 
22:03:23 IS CONCERNED THIS IS AN EXCELLENT OPPORTUNITY TO DO THIS.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

22:03:30 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.
AND NEXT SPEAKER I DON'T SEE THEIR NAME.

22:03:36 OR THEIR NUMBER.
SO I'M NOT SURE IT'S A GALAXY, IF YOU COULD SHARE YOUR NAME OR SORRY, I 
22:03:44 CAN'T CALL YOU OR REFERENCE YOU OTHERWISE WITH YOUR NUMBER.
>> HI, THIS IS DIESHING ARVES ABOUT 
22:03:51 GARDNER, HRC COMMISSIONER.

22:03:59 >> THANK YOU.
I'M REPRESENTING MYSELF, AS  WELL, I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO ENDORSE THIS 
22:04:04 HOLIDAY FM I THINK IT'S A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR FREMONT AS A COMMUNITIES TO RECOMMIT OURSELVES TO

EQUALITY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL.
