19:09:16  THAT'S SPELLED DEJURE4SURE.COM.
19:09:18 
AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE EXCHANGE 
19:09:18 THEN.
19:09:19 
AND THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SAY.
19:09:20 
THANK YOU.
19:09:23 
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
19:09:25 
OKAY.
19:09:28 
THAT IS THE LAST OF OUR PUBLIC 
19:09:29 COMMENTS.
19:09:32 
AT THIS TIME, I'LL TURN IT FOR ITEMS 
19:09:35 THAT WERE PULLED FROM THE CONSENT CALENDAR.
19:09:39 
AND I BELIEVE THAT WAS ITEM 2C, AS IN CAT.
19:09:44 
>> Councilmember Cox: SO MOVE  2C.
19:09:46 
>> Mayor Mei: NO, WE'RE ACTUALLY GOING 
19:09:48 TO HAVE THE SPEAKER FOR ITEM 2C.
19:09:49 
>> Councilmember Cox: OH, OKAY.
19:09:51 
>> Mayor Mei: WHICH IS BLAIR BEEKMAN.
19:09:55 
SO BLAIR, YOU CAN SPEAK FIRST.
19:09:55 
>> THANK YOU.
19:09:56 
HI.
19:10:01 
BLAIR BEEKMAN HERE, THANK YOU FOR THIS ITEM.
19:10:03 
YOU KNOW, WE'RE COMING OUT OF COVID.
19:10:05 
THROUGH THE WHOLE TIME OF COVID, IT 
19:10:14 WAS, I THINK, BIKE TRAIL ISSUES AND WALKABLE PATHWAYS AND YOU KNOW, THAT 
19:10:19 WORK WAS ABLE TO CONTINUE DURING THE TIME OF COVID, AND IT WAS WORK THAT WE 
19:10:25 WERE LIKE ALREADY DOING ABOUT BETTER SUSTAINABLE PRACTICES FOR OUR FUTURE.
19:10:27 
WE WERE DOING THIS STUFF WAY BEFORE 
19:10:27 COVID-19.
19:10:31 
AND YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST A LITTLE 
19:10:34 SECRET FOR PEOPLE WORKING ON THESE SORT OF THINGS.
19:10:37 
WE ARE BUILDING OUR SUSTAINABLE FUTURE.
19:10:41 
WE'RE APOLOGIZING FOR OUR ERROR OF 9/11.
19:10:44 
YOU KNOW THE WORK I DO WITH OPEN 
19:10:47 ACCOUNTABILITY WITH TECHNOLOGY PRACTICES AND DATA COLLECTION, IT'S 
19:10:54 ALL PART OF A PLAN TO SIMPLY END THE ERA OF 9/11 AND WORK TOWARDS IDEAS OF 
19:10:57 PEACE TO ADDRESS OUR QUESTIONS INSTEAD OF USING WARFARE.
19:10:59 
IT'S USING PEACE AND OPEN DEMOCRATIC 
19:11:00 PRACTICES.
19:11:02 
AN AMAZING CONCEPT.
19:11:10 
WE'RE TRYING TO DO THAT AND NE QOASH 
19:11:14 YAIT AND HAVE GOOD DIALOGUE INSTEAD OF HARMING EACH OTHER AND KEEPING 
19:11:17 EVERYTHING SECRETIVE AND AWAY FROM EACH OTHER.
19:11:21 
YOU KNOW, WITH COVID, IT WAS JUST 
19:11:24 SHOCKING THAT IT'S  HAPPENED, CONSIDERING WHAT WE'RE BUILDING, WHAT 
19:11:25 OUR FUTURE IS RIGHT NOW.
19:11:27 
THIS IS WHAT EQUITY AND REIMAGINE ARE 
19:11:28 ABOUT.
19:11:32 
AND IT IS TO BUILD A MORE PEACEFUL, 
19:11:36 SUSTAINABLE FUTURE FOR OURSELVES AS A COMMUNITY, AND HOPEFULLY THAT CAN GROW 
19:11:42 INTO SOCIETAL QUESTIONS FOR OTHER NATIONS OF THIS EARTH TO REFLECT UPON.
19:11:44 
AND THAT'S THE WAY WE BUILD THE FUTURE 
19:11:46 OF PEACE BASICALLY.
19:11:51 
SO THANKS FOR THIS ITEM TODAY.
19:11:53 
THE SUSTAINABLE PRACTICES, THIS IS 
19:11:58 GOOD COMMUNITY SUSTAINABILITY IDEAS THAT WE ALL BELIEVE IN, AND I THINK 
19:12:03 ACCOMPLISH MUCH MORE IN LONG TERM SOCIAL PLANNING IDEAS THAN HAVING 
19:12:15 WARFARE, CREATING THE PANDEMICS OR CREATING WILDFIRE SITUATIONS IN THE 
19:12:16 PG&E REALM.
19:12:18 
SO WE'RE ADDRESSING THE WORLD IN MORE 
19:12:18 PEACEFUL TERMS.
19:12:20 
WE HAVE PEACEFUL SOLUTIONS TO WORK 
19:12:22 TOWARDS OUR BETTER FUTURE.
19:12:23 
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO INVOLVE HURTING 
19:12:24 OTHER PEOPLE ANYMORE.
19:12:27 
HOW DO WE LEARN TO DO THAT TOGETHER?
19:12:31 
I THINK OPEN PUBLIC POLICY IDEAS WITH 
19:12:35 TECHNOLOGY HELP WITH THAT, EQUITY AND REIMAGINE IDEAS HELP WITH THAT, 
19:12:40 CERTAINLY THESE BICYCLE PROGRAMS DO, AND THESE BICYCLE PROJECTS AND THEY'RE 
19:12:42 REALLY IMPORTANT FOR OUR FUTURE, OUR SUSTAINABLE FUTURE.
19:12:45 
I'VE BEEN LEARNING REGIONAL 
19:12:47 TRANSPORTATION IDEAS, THE IMPORTANCE OF THAT.
19:12:50 
GREEN IDEAS.
19:12:53 
I HOPE WE CAN BE OPEN TO OPEN THINKING 
19:12:56 AND TO BE OPEN WITH OURSELVES AND WITH GOOD  THINKING.
19:12:57 
THANK YOU.
19:12:57 
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
19:13:01 
NEXT I'D LIKE TO CALL ON COUNCILMEMBER 
19:13:02 RAJ SALWAN.
19:13:03 
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN?
19:13:04 
>> Councilmember Salwan: THANK YOU, 
19:13:05 MADAME MAYOR.
19:13:07 
I WANT TO COMMEND STAFF ON THE GOOD 
19:13:10 EFFORT ON THE BIKE AND PED PLAN.
19:13:12 
IN READING THE AGENDA, THE ONLY 
19:13:19 CONCERN I HAD WAS THAT ONE OF THE ITEMS WAS NARROWING PASEO PADRE FROM 
19:13:20 DRISCOLL TO WASHINGTON.
19:13:24 
SO I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF CONCERN AT 
19:13:29 THE TIME, WE GOT LOTS OF EMAILS AND I SORT OF FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE JUST VOTING 
19:13:32 IT THROUGH WITHOUT EITHER FURTHER HEARING OR SOME MORE FEEDBACK FROM 
19:13:33 OTHER COUNCILMEMBERS.
19:13:36 
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO HAVE ANOTHER 
19:13:36 RANCHO SITUATION.
19:13:40 
SO BECAUSE IF WE PASS IT THROUGH AND 
19:13:44 THEN PEOPLE COME BACK AND SAY, HEY, WHY DID YOU GUYS DO THIS, AND SOMETIMES 
19:13:50 THESE ITEMS ON CONSENT CAN SAIL THROUGH WITHOUT PROPER DIALOGUE AND 
19:13:53 DISCUSSION, AND THAT WAS A LOT OF ANGST FOR THE COMMUNITY.
19:13:54 
SO I JUST WANTED TO OPEN THAT UP AND 
19:13:56 SEE IF THERE'S ANY OTHER FEEDBACK ON THAT.
19:13:58 
>> Mayor Mei: CERTAINLY.
19:14:02 
NEXT, COUNCILMEMBER JONES, I SEE YOU 
19:14:03 HAVE YOUR HAND RAISED ON THIS ITEM.
19:14:05 
>> Councilmember Jones: THANK YOU, 
19:14:05 MADAME MAYOR.
19:14:09 
THIS IS ACTUALLY A -- THIS SPECIFIC 
19:14:14 STRETCH OF PASEO PADRE BETWEEN WASHINGTON AND DRISCOLL IS SOMETHING 
19:14:19 THAT I DISCUSSED WITH STAFF A COUPLE YEARS AGO WHEN IT WAS STARTING THE 
19:14:22 PROCESS OF NARROWING TO ONE LANE EACH WAY BACK THEN.
19:14:26 
I HAVE SOME MAJOR CONCERNS OVER THAT, 
19:14:33 AND I SHARED THOSE WITH STAFF A COUPLE YEARS AGO THAT, YOU KNOW, FROM TEMPLE 
19:14:36 BETH  TORAH, WHICH IS, I BELIEVE, .
19:14:36 7 OR .
19:14:43 9 MILES, I DON'T RECALL WHICH, TO THE ON-RAMP OF WASHINGTON AND 680 IN 
19:14:44 COMMUTE TRAFFIC TOOK 40 MINUTES.
19:14:45 
THAT WAS WITH TWO LANES OF TRAFFIC 
19:14:47 EACH WAY.
19:14:51 
PASEO PADRE IS A MAJOR THOROUGHFARE.
19:14:52 
IT IS TWO LANES.
19:14:55 
EVERYWHERE THROUGH THE CITY WITH THE 
19:15:01 EXCEPTION BETWEEN PINE STREET AS IT GOES SOUTH AND CROSSES DURHAM AND 
19:15:04 THROUGH THE GRIMMER AND PARK MEADOW NEIGHBORHOODS, BUT EVEN WHEN IT HITS 
19:15:07 MISSION BOULEVARD AGAIN AND GOES UP INTO THE FOOTHILLS, IT BECOMES TWO 
19:15:07 LANES AGAIN.
19:15:12 
AND THIS IS A MAJOR SOURCE OF 
19:15:15 RELIEVING OUR TRAFFIC CONGESTION ON MISSION BOULEVARD, HAVING THESE TWO 
19:15:16 LANES AVAILABLE.
19:15:22 
IF THERE IS SOME WAY THAT WE CAN 
19:15:25 INCLUDE A BIKE LANE IN THERE THAT IS APPROPRIATE WITHOUT NARROWING TO TWO 
19:15:28 LANES IN EACH WAY, I WOULD BE ALL IN FAVOR OF THAT.
19:15:35 
BUT AT THIS POINT, I THINK IT REALLY 
19:15:37 NEEDS SOME FURTHER DISCUSSION TO OPEN IT UP TO COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AND TO 
19:15:38 THE OTHER COUNCILMEMBERS AS WELL.
19:15:39 
THANK YOU.
19:15:44 
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
19:15:46 
I SEE ALSO COUNCILMEMBER SHAO RAISING 
19:15:47 HIS HAND.
19:15:50 
I'LL HAVE MY COMMENTS AFTER HIM.
19:15:51 
>> Vice Mayor Shao: I WILL ECHO THE 
19:15:55 CONCERNS OF COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN AND COUNCILMEMBER JONES ESPECIALLY ON THE 
19:15:57 OUTREACH TO THE COMMUNITIES.
19:16:00 
IT WAS NOT THE FIRST TIME THIS CHANGE 
19:16:08 WAS PROPOSED AND LAST TIME WE GOT A LOT OF STRONG FEEDBACK FROM THE COMMUNITY.
19:16:11 
THEREFORE, THIS TIME I WOULD LIKE TO 
19:16:19 TAKE IT SLOW AND REALLY CONSULT -- NOT CONSULT, NOT JUST REACH OUT AND 
19:16:22 COMMUNICATE WITH THE COMMUNITY, THEREFORE, THEY FEEL THAT THEY 
19:16:24 PARTICIPATED IN THE WHOLE PROCESS.
19:16:24 
THANK YOU.
19:16:29 
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
19:16:30 
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN.
19:16:32 
>> Councilmember Kassan: I STRONGLY 
19:16:32 DISAGREE.
19:16:34 
WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS FOR 
19:16:34 YEARS.
19:16:36 
WE'VE PUT IT ON HOLD ALREADY.
19:16:39 
THIS IS A MAJOR SAFETY HAZARD FOR 
19:16:40 PEDESTRIANS.
19:16:43 
I GET CONTACTED BY PEOPLE IN THAT AREA 
19:16:48 WANTING THE STREET TO BE NARROWED AND MADE SAFER FOR PEDESTRIANS WHO LIVE 
19:16:55 NEARBY,  SO -- AND I HOPE HANS WILL MAYBE RESPOND TO THE CONCERNS THAT 
19:16:58 THERE WASN'T COMMUNITY OUTREACH BECAUSE MY UNDERSTANDING IS THERE'S BEEN 
19:16:59 EXTENSIVE COMMUNITY OUTREACH.
19:17:05 
>> Mr.
19:17:08  Larsen: MAYOR MEI, I'M HAPPY TO ADDRESS ANY QUESTIONS, UNLESS THERE'S 
19:17:08 OTHER COUNCIL COMMENT.
19:17:13 
>> Mayor Mei: I HAVE A COMMENT ON THAT TOO.
19:17:15 
I WOULD ECHO THAT I UNDERSTAND THE 
19:17:21 NEED ABSOLUTELY AND WE'VE HAD SEVERAL MAJOR INCIDENTS THERE BUT I WOULD LIKE 
19:17:24 TO EXPLORE OTHER TRAFFIC-CALMING MEASURES BECAUSE WHAT I'M A LITTLE 
19:17:28 CONCERNED ABOUT IS WE'VE HAD A LOT OF CUT-THROUGH TRAFFIC IN THAT AREA, AND 
19:17:31 THAT HAS OVERFLOWED INTO NOT JUST DISTRICT 5, DISTRICT 4 AND ALSO 
19:17:39 DISTRICT 6 IN TERMS OF ON THE CORNERS THERE ON WASHINGTON BOULEVARD, SO I 
19:17:44 TOO WOULD ECHO IF WE HAD THAT OPTION TO FIND OTHER TRAFFIC-CALMING MEASURES 
19:17:46 THAT WOULD ALSO HAVE THE BIKE CAPACITY THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING OF INTEREST TO 
19:17:47 ME.
19:17:49 
WHETHER IT'S -- I KNOW IN SOME AREAS, 
19:17:51 WE'VE TRIED THINGS LIKE OTHER SPEED MITIGATION MEASURES.
19:17:53 
I KNOW PASEO PADRE IS A MAJOR 
19:17:59 THOROUGHFARE, BUT PERHAPS THERE'S OTHER WAYS THAT WE CAN HAVE TRAFFIC-CALMING 
19:18:02 THROUGH SPEED HUMPS OR OTHER THINGS THAT WE COULD CONSIDER THAT.
19:18:02 
SO MR.
19:18:03  LARSEN, PLEASE PROCEED.
19:18:04 
>> Mr.
19:18:06  Larsen: YES, THANKS, MAYOR MEI, AND MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL.
19:18:09 
LET ME JUST KIND OF PROVIDE A LITTLE 
19:18:17 BIT OF PERSPECTIVE ON THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT AND AS THE COUNCIL RECALLS, 
19:18:35 THERE'S SOME HISTORY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS, WE HAD HAD PROPOSED TO DO THIS 
19:18:40 AND THERE WERE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT PUTTING SORT OF DEE-DEFERRING THE 
19:18:47 PROJECTS PRIMARILY THE UNTIL WE COULD SORT OF ADDRESS THE TRAFFIC CONGESTION 
19:19:01 THAT WAS OCCURRING AT WASHINGTON, PASEO, THAT WAS CAUSED BY COMMUTERS 
19:19:03 TRYING TO GET ON TO 680.
19:19:06 
LAND WAS EXPERIENCING WAS A 
19:19:14 SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF CUTS THROUGH TRAFFIC THAT WAS USING PASEO PADRE.
19:19:17 
DEVELOPING THE CORRIDOR AS  CLOSING 
19:19:22 THE GAP IN A BIKEWAY NETWORK AND ALSO PROVIDING TRAFFIC CALMING FOR THE 
19:19:26 NEIGHBORHOOD ALONG PASEO PADRE PARKWAY, WHICH WE'VE HEARD, YOU KNOW MANY 
19:19:30 CONCERNS ABOUT
AND THE SPEEDING TRAFFIC THAT GOES 
19:19:30 THROUGH THERE.
19:19:35 
SO WE DEFERRED IT UNTIL WE COULD SEE 
19:19:42 IF WE WOULD GET THE BENEFITS THAT WE EXPECTED FROM 680 WIDENING PROJECT.
19:19:44 
WE HAD BEEN CLOSELY MONITORING THIS 
19:19:47 CORRIDOR IN TERMS OF TRAFFIC VOLUMES AND BACKUP.
19:19:52 
AND I ACTUALLY DROVE IT IN THE LAST 
19:19:53 WEEK.
19:19:57 
AND REALLY WAS AMAZED TO SEE HOW MUCH 
19:20:02 BETTER THAT CORRIDOR IS DUE TO THE WIDENING OF 680.
19:20:04 
SO WE DON'T HAVE THE LONG AMOUNT OF 
19:20:04 COMMUTE.
19:20:08 
ACTUALLY, THERE IS STILL A LOT OF 
19:20:18  CONGESTION ON 680, YOU DON'T HAVE THE TRAVEL TIME BENEFIT THAT PEOPLE 
19:20:26 JUSTIFIED TO GET IN CUTTING THROUGH MISSION AND PASEO PADRE PARKWAY AS A 
19:20:27 CUT
THROUGH FROM 680.
19:20:29 
I THINK AS STAFF WE BELIEVE THAT THIS 
19:20:42 IS AN IMPORTANT PROJECT.
19:20:45 
THERE IS NOT THE AMOUNT OF VOLUME ON 
19:20:50 PASEO PADRE PARKWAY IN JUFERG IT BEING A FOUR LANE ROADWAY.
19:20:52 
PART OF OUR MULTIMODAL TRANSPORTATION 
19:20:56 PLANNING IS  LOOKING AT WHAT ARE CORRIDORS THAT WERE REALLY OVERBUILT 
19:21:02 IN THE PAST, THAT WE CAN MODIFY AND MAKE THEM MORE MULTIMODAL AND SAFE.
19:21:06 
AND SO I THINK IT'S OUR STAFF 
19:21:09 RECOMMENDATION TO DO THIS PROJECT.
19:21:12 
I THINK OUR BICYCLE COMMUNITIES IS 
19:21:12 EXPECTING IT.
19:21:15 
I BELIEVE THERE IS STRONG SUPPORT 
19:21:19 WITHIN THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND THE PAST CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED BY 
19:21:25 FOLKS COMMUTING IN THE CORRIDOR HAS LARGELY BEEN ALLEVIATED WITH THE 
19:21:26 IMPROVEMENTS ONTO THE
FREEWAY.
19:21:29 
I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS 
19:21:31 THAT COUNCIL HAS.
19:21:33 
>> Mayor Mei:   I THINK WE ALSO HAVE 
19:21:34 COMMENTS FROM COUNCILMEMBER COX.
19:21:37 
BUT I ALSO JUST WANT TOD SAY THAT 
19:21:47 ED TO SAY, WE'RE JUST RETURNING TO THE WORKFORCE, I'D LIKE TO GET A BETTER 
19:21:50 VISIBILITY AS WE SEE HOW THAT'S BEEN TRANSITIONING.
19:21:56 
IT'S BEEN A LITTLE BIT L ARTIFICIALLY 
19:21:57 SUPPRESSED AT THIS TIME.
19:21:59 
AS WE RETURN TO THE OFFICE I THINK 
19:22:00 THAT MIGHT EXCHANGE.
19:22:01 
COUNCILMEMBER COX DO YOU HAVE COMMENTS 
19:22:02 ON THIS?
19:22:03 
>> Councilmember Cox:   YES I  DO.
19:22:05 
I THINK IT'S BELONG THE LINES THAT IF 
19:22:17 WE LOOK AT SOME OF THE STUDIES THAT WERE DONE IN 2019, CAN PREPANDEMIC, TO 
19:22:21 MAKE SURE WE HAVE SOME REALITY CHECKS BUT ALSO WE PROBABLY NEED SOME MORE 
19:22:23 TIME TO BE
ABLE TO TAKE A LK AT THERE.
19:22:26 
AND I REALLY APPRECIATE MY FELLOW CITY 
19:22:32 COUNCIL MEMBERS TO VOICING SOME OF THE THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN TAKEN IN THE 
19:22:34 PAST AND PUT INTO CONSIDERATION.
19:22:37 
I THINK KIND OF REALISTICALLY, TO DO 
19:22:45 IT RIGHT NOW, IT'S A LITTLE PREMATURE IN KIND OF LEADING TO THAT.
19:22:48 
THE SECOND PART IS I'M ALSO WONDERING 
19:22:58 BY DOING THESE ACTIONS AND THAT ARE BEING LAID OUT RIGHT NOW.
19:23:02 
HOW IS THAT GOING TO CAN IMPACT THE 
19:23:06 IRVINGTON BART STATION AND THAT IS ALL KIND OF GOING IN THAT DIRECTION AND IS 
19:23:10 THERE THEN SOME CONSIDERATION AS YOU'RE NEARING THE ROADS THAT THERE ARE 
19:23:14 THINGS THAT
PEOPLE ARE GOING TO EXPECT TO BE ABLE 
19:23:23  TO GOAT BART AND PARK THERE FEEFN THOSE GO ONTO THE FREEWAYS.
19:23:24 
ABOUT IF YOU COULD ADD A LITTLE BIT 
19:23:30 MORE ON YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT PART AND WHERE IS THAT PUT INTO THE PICTURE?
19:23:33 
>> Hans Larsen:   YEAH, SO I THINK TO 
19:23:41 SORT OF GET BACK TO THE PRIMARY CONCERN IN THE PAST, AND WE DID DO MAILERS TO 
19:23:44 THE COMMUNITY WITHIN THE CORRIDOR WHETHER THE PROJECT WAS PREVIOUSLY

19:23:45 PROPOSED.
19:23:49 
WE STILL HAVE AN ACTIVE WEB PAGE FOR 
19:23:49 THE PROJECT.
19:23:52 
SO I THINK IN TERMS OF JUST OVERALL 
19:23:58 KIND OF TRAFFIC, AGAIN, AND I'D HAVE TO KINDS OF GO BACK AND SORT OF DAY A 
19:24:03  TAKE A LOOK AT THE NUMBERS.
19:24:05 
BUT THE CONCERN IN THE PAST WAS 
19:24:16 LARGELY DRIVEN BY THE LONG QUEUES THAT WERE BACKED UNON THE 680 WASHINGTON 
19:24:24 INTERCHANGE AND BACKED UP FOR LONG DISTANCES ON PASEO, PEOPLE LOOKING FOR 
19:24:27 A SHORTCUT
THROUGH FREMONT STREETS ON 680.
19:24:30 
IF THAT TRAFFIC ISN'T THERE, AND THEN 
19:24:37 THERE REALLY IS NO ISSUE IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW THE NEED FOR FOUR E LANES ON 
19:24:44  LANES FOR TRAFFIC ON PASEO IN THIS COMMUNITY.
19:24:49 
THAT LEAVES ROOM FOR GROWTH AROUND 
19:24:51 FUTURE BART STATION AND TRAFFIC PATTERNS.
19:24:54 
WE ALSO WANT TO PROVIDE A REALLY GOOD 
19:24:59 ACCESS FOR PEOPLE WALKING AND BIKING TO OUR TRANSIT STATIONS AND THIS 
19:25:04 CERTAINLY IS KIND OF A CRITICAL GAP IN THE NECK WORK IN THE AREA.
19:25:07 
IF LET ME KIND OF OFFER A COUPLE OF 
19:25:09 ALTERNATIVES FOR COUNCIL ON THE SITE.
19:25:14 
THIS IS ONE OF 12 PROJECTS WITHIN A 
19:25:19 CONTRACT THAT WE'RE PROPOSING TO AWARD HERE.
19:25:22 
WE'D BE HAPPY TO PROVIDE A FOLLOW-UP 
19:25:34 REPORT ON THIS PARTICULAR TOPIC AND IF THAT'S IMICIAL TO DECIDE YES OR NO 
19:25:35 FROM THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT.
19:25:39 
FROM A CRUT MANAGEMENT PERSPECTIVE.
19:25:43 
THE CONTRACTOR DID BID ON THIS BUT WE 
19:25:47 DO HAVE FLEXIBILITY TO PULL PART OF THE SCOPE OF WORK OUTS OF THE CONTRACT, IF 
19:25:51 THAT'S A DIRECTION THAT THE COUNCIL DECIDES.
19:26:03 
WE COULD DO THE TWO WAYS, DECIDE 
19:26:06 WHETHER WEE WANT TO DO IT OR  NOT, I THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF MEMBERS OF 
19:26:11 THE COMMUNITY THAT ARE I THINK VERY MUCH LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS PROJECT 
19:26:11 GETTING DONE.
19:26:13 
I THINK THEY WOULD LIKE AN OPPORTUNITY 
19:26:19 TO SPEAK WITH COUNCIL AS WELL AS OTHERS WHO 98 BE CONCERNED, CONTINUE TO HAVE 
19:26:21 CONCERNS ABOUT TRAFFIC CAPACITY IN THE AREA.
19:26:23 
AND SO WE COULD BRING THIS BACK 
19:26:31 CERTAINLY WITHIN THE DURATION OF THIS CONTRACT TO HAVE A DISCUSSION WITH THE 
19:26:33 COUNCIL OR THE COMMUNITY ON THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT.
19:26:35 
SO I GUESS MY RECOMMENDATION IF 
19:26:42 THERE'S EITHER -- WE COULD HAVE THIS GO FORWARD, WITH SUBJECT TO THE PROJECT 
19:26:48 HAVING A FURTHER COMMUNITY REVIEW, THAT -- KEEP TONIGHT THERE, REWARD THE 
19:26:52 CONTRACT AS IT IS,
 OR PROVIDE DIRECTION NOW TO NAWL FROM 
19:26:58  PULL THAT FROM THE CONTRACT, KEEP IT MOVING FORWARD BUT PRESERVE AN OPTION 
19:27:02 TO ALLOW CONSIDERATION OF BRINGING IT BACK BASED ON FURTHER COMMUNITIES 
19:27:04 REVIEW AND
COUNCIL DISCUSSION.
19:27:06 
BUT OFFER THAT AS KIND OF COUPLE WAYS 
19:27:07 TO GO.
19:27:09 
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.
19:27:16 
>> I'M SORRY, MAYOR MEI, I WANTED TO 
19:27:20 THANK HANS FOR PROVIDING THOSE OPTIONS AND I THINK ONCE YOU ALL GET TO A 
19:27:25 POINT OOF MAKING A MOTION YOU CAN DECIDE L HOW YOU WANT TO HANDLE IT 
19:27:27 MOVING FORWARD
THROUGH THE MOTION.
19:27:29 
>> Mayor Mei:   WONDERFUL.
19:27:32 
THANK YOU HANS FOR THE NUMBER OF 
19:27:34 DIFFERENT OPTIONS.
19:27:38 
COUNCILMEMBER JONES YOU HAVE YOUR HAND 
19:27:39 RAISED.
19:27:41 
>> Councilmember Jones:   THANK YOU, 
19:27:42 MADAM MAYOR.
19:27:45 
HANS HOW WIDE ARE THE LANES ON PASEO 
19:27:46 PADRE THERE?
19:27:49 
>> Hans Larsen:   TYPICALLY, KIND OF 
19:27:52 HISTORICAL, FREMONT HAD VERY WIDE LANES.
19:27:57 
SECTIONS OF PASEO PADRE PARKWAY HAD 
19:28:00 LANES THAT WERE 12 TO 14 FEET WIDE.
19:28:01 
GENERALLY WE HAVE BEEN LOOKING TO 
19:28:04 NARROW THEM FOR SPEED MANAGEMENT.
19:28:08 
IN THIS PARTICULAR AREA, THERE'S TWO 
19:28:14 LANES AND ONSTREET PARKING AND SO THERE ISN'T AN OPPORTUNITY TO GET ANY -- TO 
19:28:19 ALLOW ANY BICYCLE TRAFFIC THROUGH HERE UNLESS YOU REMOVED ONE OF THE LANES.
19:28:23 
AND SO THE LANE WOULD COME -- THE BIKE 
19:28:26 LANE WOULD BE A STANDARD BIKE LANE PLUS A  BUFFER.
19:28:32 
AND WHAT WE FIND IN THESE KIND OF 
19:28:38 SITUATIONS WHERE THAT THE VOLUMES OF TRAFFIC ARE WAY UNDER -- ARE LESS THAN 
19:28:42 WHAT THE ROADWAY IS LAID OUT FOR.
19:28:44 
THEY BECOME SPEED WAYS AND PEOPLE, YOU 
19:28:50 KNOW, USE THE EXTRA LANE FOR PASSING, AND IT CREATES A CONCERN FOR PEOPLE 
19:28:54 THAT LIVE ON THE STREET, THAT HAVE DRIVEWAYS THAT BACK OUT TO IT.
19:28:56 
SOME OF THE SIDE STREETS.
19:29:01 
WE'VE HAD CONCERNS WITH -- CONCERNS 
19:29:05 WITH PEOPLE THAT ARE TRYING TO WALK OR BIKE TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD SCHOOL, 
19:29:09 THEY'RE HAVING TO CROSS PASEO PADRE PARKWAY HERE AND HAVING TO DEAL WITH 
19:29:11 HIGH SPEED AND TWO
LANES OF TRAFFIC.
19:29:16 
AND SO THOSE ARE -- YEAH, SO I DON'T 
19:29:22 KNOW OFF HAND BUT IF THERE IS IF COUNCIL WOULD LIKE  FOLLOW-UP WE CAN 
19:29:24 PROVIDE ANSWERS TO WHATEVER QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE.
19:29:28 
BUT BASICALLY THERE IS NOT ENOUGH 
19:29:36 WIDTH THERE TO NARROW THE LANES AND FIT IN A BIKE LANE IF THAT IS KIND OF THE 
19:29:37 INTENT BEHIND YOUR QUESTION.
19:29:40 
>> Councilmember Jones:   SO I'M 
19:29:45 TRYING TO RECALL, AND I HONESTLY HAVEN'T DRIVEN THERE IN A LITTLE BIT.
19:29:48 
BUT IS THERE ONSTREET PARKING ALLOWED 
19:29:50 ON PASEO PADRE PARKWAY?
19:29:53 
>> Hans Larsen:   YES, THERE IS FULL 
19:29:58 ON RESIDENTIAL THERE AND THEY HAVE ALLOWED ONSTREET PARKING.
19:29:59 
>> Councilmember Jones:   WHAT I HAVE 
19:30:05 SEEN ON GOOGLE EARTH, THERE ARE SIDEWALKS BOTH SIDES, AND I DON'T SEE 
19:30:06 AN EFFORT THERE FOR CHANGING THAT.
19:30:09 
AND IT LOOKS TO ME LIKE IF THE NUMBER 
19:30:15 ONE LANES ARE 12 FEET THE NUMBER TWO LANES ARE CLOSER TO 16 MAYBE 18 FEET 
19:30:18 JUST EYEBALLING IT ON GOOGLE EARTH.
19:30:23 
AND WHEN WE DO OCOMPLETE STREETS 
19:30:25 YOU'RE NARROWING IT TO TEN FEET IS THAT CORRECT?
19:30:27 
>> Hans Larsen:   YES, TEN FEET AND WE 
19:30:31 WILL KEEP AN EXTRA FOOT NEXT TO A RAISED ISLAND.
19:30:32 
>> Councilmember Jones:   OKAY.
19:30:34 
I'VE GOT MY CONCERNS ABOUT US COMING 
19:30:38 OUT OF THE PANDEMIC AND THE AMOUNT OF TRAFFIC THAT IS GOING TO BE GENERATED.
19:30:41 
AND AS COUNCILMEMBER COX BROUGHT UP 
19:30:46 THE AMOUNT OF TRAFFIC THAT MAY OR MAY NOT WE DON'T KNOW BE GENERATED FOR THE 
19:30:50 IRVINGTON BART STATION, BUT THAT IS CERTAINLY A CONSIDERATION.
19:30:54 
BUT AGAIN IT IS A MAJOR THOROUGHFARE, 
19:30:57 USED BY A NUMBER OF PEOPLE, SO I DON'T THINK THEY PERSONALLY SAVE ANY TIME 
19:31:02 BUT THEY DON'T WANT TO SIT ON MISSION BOULEVARD DO GET ON 680.
19:31:06 
IF THERE WERE SOME WAY TO NARROW THE 
19:31:14 LANES TO AN ACCEPTABLE  WIDTH, IF IT'S THE TEN FOOT THAT IS THE STANDARD AND 
19:31:21 INCORPORATE A BIKE CAL LANE INTO IT, I THINK THAT WOULD BE MUCH MORE

19:31:27  IN FAVOR OF THIS.
19:31:30 
I WOULD BE IN FAVOR OF PULLING THIS 
19:31:36  PARTICULAR CONTRACT AND BRINGING IT IMARK FOR  DISCUSSION.
19:31:40  BACK FOR DISCUSSION.
19:31:42 
>> Mayor Mei:   ANOTHER COMMENT?
19:31:43 
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN.
19:31:44 
>> Councilmember Salwan:   THANK YOU.
19:31:47 
FIRST I'M IMPRESSED BY COUNCILMEMBER 
19:31:54 JONES GETTING AN IMPRESSION OF THE WIDTH OF THE LANES FROM GOOGLE.
19:32:37 
I TOO WOULD LIKE TO BE SEE IF THERE'S 
19:32:41 A WAIT TO PRESERVE THE BIKE LANES BY TRYING TO KEEP THE TWO LANES, IF 
19:32:44 THERE'S A WAY TO FIND THAT MIDDLE GROUND.
19:32:46 
YOU KNOW IT'S CALLED PASEO PADRE 
19:32:47 PARKWAY.
19:32:49 
SO IT'S OUR MAJOR THOROUGH FARE FOR 
19:32:59  THOROUGHFARE FOR THE CITY.
19:33:01 
I'M CONCERNED THAT DURING THE PANDEMIC 
19:33:06 PEOPLE ARE STILL NOT WORKING, WE DON'T HAVE THE PEAK TRAFFIC RIGHT NOW.
19:33:09 
WE NEED TO SEE HOW MUCH DOES TRAFFIC 
19:33:10 GO UP BEFORE WE GO FURTHER.
19:33:13 
THE OTHER QUESTION I HAD WAS, ALL 
19:33:17 THOSE PEOPLE THAT SIGNED UP FOR THE E-MAILS, WERE THEY  ALERTED FOR THESE 
19:33:17 MEETINGS?
19:33:19 
WERE THEY NOTIFIED ABOUT THIS MEETING, 
19:33:20 ABOUT THIS ITEM?
19:33:22 
>> Mayor Mei:   SO ACTUALLY WHY DON'T 
19:33:26 WE GO THROUGH AND I'M NOT GOING TO INTERRUPT YOU, COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN 
19:33:31 BUT I THINK WE ARE GOING TO ASK OUR QUESTIONS AND ALLOW STAFF TO ANSWER AT 
19:33:33 ONCE.
19:33:34 
I DON'T KNOW COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN IF 
19:33:39 YOU HAVE ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS BUT I'M GOING DO LET HANS AND STAFF ANSWER ALL 
19:33:40 AT ONCE.
19:33:42 
>> Councilmember Salwan:   THAT WAS MY 
19:33:42 QUESTION.
19:33:44 
L.
19:33:50 
>> Mayor Mei:   COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN 
19:33:55 DO YOU A QUESTION OR COMMENT?
19:33:57 
>> Councilmember Kassan:   A COMMENT.
19:33:59 
I REALLY, REALLY HOPE WE WILL NOT GO 
19:34:01 IN THE DIRECTION OF DELAYING THIS AGAIN.
19:34:03 
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE IN THAT 
19:34:06 NEIGHBORHOOD HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR, FOR A REALLY LONG TIME.
19:34:07 
WE HAVE PROFESSIONALS THAT ARE TELLING 
19:34:12 US WE DON'T NEED TWO LANES AND ALSO A PROFESSIONAL THAT'S TELLING US THERE'S 
19:34:15 NO WAY TO HAVE A BIKE LANE AND TWO LANES OF TRAFFIC.
19:34:16 
AS MUCH AS WE WISH THAT COULD  BE, WE 
19:34:18 HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE.
19:34:21 
AND WE HAVE TO, EVERY TIME WE MAKE 
19:34:26 DECISIONS LIKE THIS, WE HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN IS IT MORE IMPORTANT FOR THE 
19:34:30 CARS DRIVING ON THE STREETS TO GO A FEW -- YOU KNOW GET TO THEIR DESTINATION 
19:34:33 LIKE ONE OR
TWO MINUTES FASTER OR IS IT MORE 
19:34:36 IMPORTANT FOR THE PEDESTRIANS AND THE NEIGHBORHOOD WHO WANT TO CROSS THE 
19:34:39 STREET TO NOT GET KILLED BY A SPEEDING CAR?
19:34:41 
IS IT MORE IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE THAT 
19:34:45 LIVE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD TO NOT HAVE THAT LOUD NOISE AND THAT 
19:34:49 UNPLEASANTNESS OF LIVING NEXT TO THAT SPEEDWAY FOR BICYCLISTS?
19:34:51 
YOU KNOW FOR THE PEOPLE THAT ARE -- 
19:34:56 EVERYONE WHO IS NOT IN A CAR YOU KNOW WHICH IS A LOT OF PEOPLE.
19:34:59 
SO I JUST FEEL LIKE IT'S  DISTURBING 
19:35:10  DISTURBING THAT PEOPLE ARE SO CONCERNED ABOUT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT 
19:35:11 IN THEIR CARS.
19:35:13 
WE HAVE MADE A COMMITMENT TO 
19:35:17 PRIORITIZE PEOPLE OUTSIDE OF SINGLE OCCUPANCY VEHICLES.
19:35:20 
I REALLY HOPE WE WASN'T DELAY THIS 
19:35:21 ANYMORE.
19:35:23 
>> Mayor Mei:   COUNCILMEMBER SHAO, 
19:35:31 ANY OTHER CLARIFYING QUESTIONS?
19:35:34 
>> Councilmember Shao:   I LIVE IN THE 
19:35:42 NEIGHBORHOOD AND I ALSO OBSERVE PEOPLE'S TRAFFIC PATTERNS AND THE 
19:35:42 WIDTH OF THE ROAD.
19:35:46 
I NOTICE THE DRISCOLL RODE THAT I LIVE 
19:35:52 BY USED TO BE TWO-LANE AND NOW THE LANES ARE NARROWED AND THE BICYCLE 
19:35:53 LANE WAS  CREATED.
19:35:55 
AND THAT THAT COULD BE DONE.
19:35:58 
SO I DIDN'T DO THE DRECT COMPARISON 
19:36:09  DIRECT COMPARISON BETWEEN THE DRISCOLL RODE AND PASEO PADRE PARKWAY.
19:36:14 
I LIKE COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN'S PROPOSAL 
19:36:20 BY ANY CHANCE WE COULD PRESERVE THE TWO LANES BEING ABLE TO CREATE A BICYCLE 
19:36:20 LANE.
19:36:21 
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.
19:36:22 
COUNCILMEMBER JONES DO YOU HAVE 
19:36:23 ANOTHER COMMENT?
19:36:26 
I THINK WE'RE TRYING TO GET  TO --

19:36:29 >> Councilmember Jones:   ACTUALLY JUST A COUPLE OF OTHER CLAIRE DPIEG 
19:36:29 QUESTIONS.
19:36:35  CLARIFYING QUESTIONS.
19:36:38 
I KNOW IT IS AN AREA WHERE PEOPLE ARE 
19:36:42 GOING OVER THE SPEED LIMIT ALTHOUGH IT IS TECHNICALLY 30 MILES AN HOUR, WE 
19:36:45 USED TO DO ENFORCEMENT THERE QUITE OFTEN.
19:36:49 
I THINK POST-PANDEMIC IT IS GOING TO 
19:36:53 SLOW PEOPLE DOWN AS TO THE AMOUNT OF TRAFFIC GOING THERE FOR COMMUTE TRAFFIC.
19:36:56 
THE QUESTION I WOULD HAVE IS HAVE WE 
19:37:02 HAD ANY SERIOUS COLLISIONS IN THE AREA IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS WHETHER THEY 
19:37:08 BE INVOLVING VEHICLES OR CAN AUTO-PED OR WHAT HAVE YOU?
19:37:12 
WE HAVE OTHER SYSTEMS FOR A VISIBLE 
19:37:15 CROSSWALK, THAT TYPE OF LIGHTING SYSTEM.
19:37:18 
BUT AGAIN, I THINK WE SHOULD LOOK AT 
19:37:23 THIS AS A SEPARATE ISSUE AS FAR AS THIS PROJECT IS CONCERNED.
19:37:25 
AND GET SOME MORE INPUT ON IT AND I 
19:37:34 WOULD LIKE TO SEE WHAT ARE THE MEASUREMENTS, HOW CAN WE MOVE THIS 
19:37:36 FORWARD IN THE MOST EFFICIENT WAY POSSIBLE.
19:37:39 
IT'S NOT ALL ABOUT PROTECTING 
19:37:47 MOTORISTS, IT'S ABOUT MULTIMODAL TRANSPORTATION, INCLUDING VEHICLES AND 
19:37:50 PEDESTRIANS AND OTHER.
19:37:53 
>> Mayor Mei:   DO YOU HAVE ANOTHER 
19:37:54 QUESTION COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN?
19:37:56 
>> Councilmember Salwan:   MADAM I'D 
19:37:58 LIKE TO MAKE A MOTION.
19:37:59 
>> Mayor Mei:   GO AHEAD.
19:38:00 
>> Councilmember Salwan:   I'D LIKE TO 
19:38:07 MOVE THIS ITEM FORWARD WITH THE EXCEPTION OF WASHINGTON AND DRIS COL.
19:38:08 
>> Mayor Mei:   SAY THAT AGAIN.
19:38:10 
>> Councilmember Salwan:   BACKGROUND 
19:38:12 NOISE I DON'T KNOW WHERE.
19:38:15 
I'D LIKE TO MOVE THIS ITEM, CAN 
19:38:16 EVERYBODY PAUSE?
19:38:18 
>> Mayor Mei:   YES, I'M HAVING 
19:38:19 DIFFICULTIES HEARING TOO.
19:38:20 
>> Councilmember Salwan:   SO I'D LIKE 
19:38:25 TO MOVE THIS ITEM WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE CHANGES  CONFAPPED, BETWEEN 
19:38:35  ON PASEO PADRE, WITH CHANGES BETWEEN DRISCOLL AND WASHINGTON.
19:38:37 
>> Councilmember Kassan:   ARE WE ABLE 
19:38:41 TO HAVE HANS CLARIFY OR ARE YOU WANTING TO VOTE WITHOUT THAT?
19:38:45 
>> Mayor Mei: HANS DO YOU WANT TO 
19:38:47 CLARIFY DID ANSWERS TO THE QUESTION?
19:38:50 
>> Hans Larsen:   YES, I THINK CRASH 
19:38:57 HISTORY, ALTERNATIVE DESIGNS, ESTIMATIONS HOW TRAFFICING WOULD 
19:39:02 ADJUST  POST-PANDEMIC, WE WOULD HAVE DO TAKE TIME AND COME BACK ON  THOSE.
19:39:04 
TO COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN'S QUESTION 
19:39:18  ABOUT ANY RENOTIFICATION, WE PREVIOUSLY DID OUTREACH ON THE PROJECT.
19:39:21 
WE HAD A DIRECTION TO GO  FORWARD, WE 
19:39:26 ACTUALLY DUE TO CONCERNS WHILE THE PROJECT WAS UNDER CONSTRUCTION, 
19:39:29 DEFERRED IT FROM THE CONSTRUCTION WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT WE WOULD COME 
19:39:35 BACK AND DO
IT ONCE THE LANE ON 680 WAS ADD ED.
19:39:38  ADDED.
19:39:41 
SO WE BROUGHT THIS BACK KIND OF BASED 
19:39:44 ON THAT CONTEXT BUT DIDN'T REOPEN IT FOR NOTIFICATION.
19:39:47 
IF THAT'S A DIRECT OR DESIRE FROM 
19:39:49 COUNCIL WE CERTAINLY WOULD HAPPY TO DO THAT.
19:39:53 
>> Councilmember Kassan:   AND I HAVE 
19:39:54 A POINT OF CLARIFICATION.
19:39:56 
DID YOU NOT SAY EARLIER THAT THERE WAS 
19:40:00 NO WAY TO HAVE --
>> Councilmember Salwan:   WE HAVE A 
19:40:00 MOTION AND SECOND.
19:40:01 
>> Councilmember Kassan:   I KNOW BUT 
19:40:05 I FEEL LIKE THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF INFORMATION THAT'S BEEN CONTRADICTING 
19:40:09 EACH OTHER SO DID WE COULD GET THAT CLEAR I'D REALLY APPRECIATE --

19:40:10 >> Councilmember Salwan:   I THINK MR.
19:40:14  LARSON HAS SAID HE WOULD HAVE TO RESEARCH THAT INFORMATION AND BRING IT 
19:40:14 BACK.
19:40:16 
SO AGAIN FOR THE POINT OF ORDER WE 
19:40:19 HAVE A MOTION --
>> Councilmember Kassan:   I JUST 
19:40:22 WANTED TO ASK FOR CLARIFICATION OF SOMETHING THAT HE SAID.
19:40:23 
BECAUSE I HEARD MR.
19:40:29  LARSON SAY THAT THERE WAS NO WAY TO HAVE TWO LANES OF TRAFFIC AND A BIKE 
19:40:30 LANE ABOUT.
19:40:32 
AND THEN LATER I HEARD SOME 
19:40:35 COUNCILMEMBER SAY, CAN WE RESEARCH WHETHER THAT IS POSSIBLE.
19:40:38 
SO I JUST WANTED TO FIND OUT IS IT 
19:40:48 TRUE THAT YOU ALREADY KNOW THAT THERE IS NO WAY TO DO THAT, OR IS IT --

19:40:49 >> Mayor Mei:   MR.
19:40:50  LARSON.
19:40:56 
I THINK THAT I GUESS THE EXAMPLE THAT 
19:41:02 WAS GIVEN PERHAPS YOU STATE THEY'D THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS NOT FEASIBLE 
19:41:05 BUT I UNDERSTAND THERE ARE SOME WORK THAT WAS DONE ON DRISCOLL.
19:41:10 
SO IF YOU WOULD COMPARE IT TOO, CAN 
19:41:14 DRISCOLL ALSO HAS A FROONT FACING ROAD WITH STREET PARKING.
19:41:17 
IS THIS SOMETHING YOU ALSO WOULD DO 
19:41:20 RESEARCH ON BECAUSE I FIND THE TWO ROADS OR THE VERY SIMILAR IN 
19:41:20 CONSTRUCTION.
19:41:24 
I TOO LIVE NEARBY AND I DRIVE IT EVERY 
19:41:26 DAY SO I KNOW IT TOO.
19:41:28 
>> Hans Larsen:   WE WOULD HAVE TO 
19:41:34 TAKE A LOOK AT THAT MORE CLOSELY BUT MY SENSE IS THAT THERE -- WE WOULD NOT BE 
19:41:41 ABLE TO GET -- MAINTAIN TWO LANES AND GET WHAT WE WOULD CONSIDER SORT OF A 
19:41:45 SAFER,
ATTRACTIVE BIKE LANE IN THERE.
19:41:48 
YOU'RE ESSENTIALLY PUTTING FOLKS IN A 
19:41:53 NARROW BIKE LANE NEXT TO PARKED CARS WHERE YOU HAVE IS DOORS OPENING UP.
19:41:56 
AND I'M PRETTY CONFIDENT THERE ISN'T 
19:42:00 THE SPACE IN THIS CORRIDOR TO BE ABLE TO DO WHAT WE HAVE PERHAPS DONE IN 
19:42:01 OTHER CORRIDORS.
19:42:04 
BUT I WOULD -- YOU KNOW TO CONFIRM 
19:42:09 THAT, OR LOOK CREATIVELY AT ALTERNATIVES, WE WOULD HAVE TO COME 
19:42:12 BACK AND WE'RE CERTAINLY HAPPY TO DO THAT.
19:42:13 
>> Councilmember Kassan:   I WOULD 
19:42:17 OFFER THAT THAT'S PROBABLY OUR BEST BET WHICH IS JUST WHAT HANS OFFERED RIGHT 
19:42:24 NOW, IS LOOK AT OTHER CREATIVE OPTIONS FOR THIS PARTICULAR STRETCH.
19:42:27 
MAYBE IT'S RETAINING TWO LANES, MAYBE 
19:42:29 IT'S NOT RETAINING BOTH LANES.
19:42:33 
MAYBE IT'S A WIDER ONE LANE AND A MORE 
19:42:34 COMFORTABLE BIKE LANE.
19:42:36 
I MEAN IT COULD BE ANY NUMBER OF 
19:42:36 OPTIONS.
19:42:40 
BUT I THINK WE'RE HEARING ALL OF YOUR 
19:42:46 COMMENTS AND CONTINGENT UPON WHATEVER MOTION IS MADE AND APPROVED, WE CAN GO 
19:42:51 BACK AND DO OUR DUE DILIGENCE AND TRY TO DESIGN SOMETHING THAT'S MORE 
19:42:54 COMFORTABLE FOR
THE  NEIGHBORHOOD.
19:42:56 
>> Mayor Mei:   WELL, WE DO HAVE A 
19:42:57 MOTION AND SECOND AT THIS  TIME.
19:42:59 
MOTION BY COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN AND 
19:43:03 SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER KENG I THINK.
19:43:04 
I APOLOGIZE.
19:43:06 
THERE WAS QUITE A FEW PEOPLE WHO 
19:43:07 ANSWERED AT THAT TIME.
19:43:09 
SO WITH THAT SAID, COULD I GET A 
19:43:15 CLARIFICATION, COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN AGAIN OF YOUR MOTION AND THEN ALSO IF 
19:43:19 WE COULD COULD GET A ROLL CALL VOTE FOR THAT  PLEASE, THANK YOU.
19:43:22 
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN.
19:43:25 
ARE YOU --

19:43:27 >> Councilmember Salwan:   OH YES, I DID MAKE THE MOTION.
19:43:29 
DO YOU WANT ME TO MAKE IT AGAIN?
19:43:31 
>> Mayor Mei:   COULD YOU JUST 
19:43:34 RESEDATE IT AGAIN, BECAUSE THERE WAS SO MUCH CONVERSATION IN BETWEEN.
19:43:35 
>> Councilmember Salwan:   OKAY I 
19:43:41 WOULD LIKE TO MOVE STAFF RECOMMENDATION WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE ITEM OF 
19:43:45 PASEO PADRE LANE NARROWING BETWEEN DRISCOLL AND WASHINGTON.
19:43:47 
>> Mayor Mei:   IT WAS MOTIONED AND 
19:43:48 SECONDED.
19:43:50 
BY COUNCILMEMBER KENG.
19:43:53 
RLG CALL VOTE THANK YOU.
19:43:56 
>> The Clerk:   YES MAXED MAYOR.
19:43:58 
COUNCILMEMBER COX.
19:43:58 
AYE.
19:44:02 
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN, I'M.
19:44:04 
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN.
19:44:06 
>> Councilmember Kassan:   NO AND 
19:44:10 COULD IT BE CLEAR IN THE MINUTES WHY I'M VOTING NO AS IT OFTEN IS, THANK 
19:44:11 YOU.
19:44:13 
>> The Clerk:   COUNCILMEMBER JONES, 
19:44:14 AYE.
19:44:14 
COUNCILMEMBER KENG.
19:44:16

19:44:18

>> Mayor Mei:   AYE SO THE MOTION 
19:44:31 PASSES WITH SIX AYES AND ONE NAY.
19:44:33 
MAKE SURE WE ARE CLEAR ON THAT IN THE 
19:44:34 MOTION.
19:44:36 
BACK TO OUR PUBLIC HEARING ITEMS THIS 
19:44:37 EVENING.
19:44:43 
AND WE HAVE ONE IS THE FREMONT FIVEA 
19:44:46 WHICH IS THE FREMONT LANDSCAPING DISTRICT FOR DISTRICT 88.

19:45:10 COUNCILMEMBER ON THIS AGENDA ITEM THIS EVENING?
19:45:13 
ACTUALLY I NEED TO TURN THIS OVER TO I 
19:45:18 BELIEVE VICE MAYOR SHAO OR THIS SITUATION, AND COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN 
19:45:21 AND I MAY NEED TO DROP OFF.
19:45:23

19:45:33 LIKE TO-BE HAPPY TO TAKE OVER AND AS MAYOR JUST SAID, OUR DIRECTOR WOLF 
19:45:34 WITH START WITH A PRESENTATION.
19:45:42 
>> WE HAVE NO PRESENTATION THIS 
19:45:45 EVENING BUT WE ARE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUE THAT YOU MAY  HAVE.
19:45:46 
>> Councilmember Shao:   SO 
19:45:50 COUNCILMEMBERS DO WE HAVE ANY CLARIFYING QUESTIONS FOR THE FIRST 
19:45:52 ROUND?
19:46:02 
OKAY COUNCILMEMBER JONES.
19:46:04 
>> Councilmember Jones:   SORRY TO 
19:46:04 INTERRUPT.
19:46:06 
DO WE NEED TO OPEN AND CLOSE THE 
19:46:09 PUBLIC HEARING FOR THIS ITEM OR A PUBLIC HEARING?
19:46:10 
>> Councilmember Shao:   THEN I WILL 
19:46:16 ASK THE PUBLIC SPEAKER TO SPEAK FIRST BEFORE CLOSING THE PUBLIC HEARING.
19:46:24 
>> SO COUNCILMEMBER SHAO WHAT 
19:46:28 COUNCILMEMBER JONES IS ASKING YOU'RE GETTING QUESTIONS FROM THE COUNCIL NOW 
19:46:28 WHICH IS FINE.
19:46:30 
IF THERE ARE NO QUESTIONS YOU SHOULD 
19:46:34 OPEN THE PUBLIC HEARING, SEE IF THERE ARE ANY PUBLIC SPEAKERS, IF THERE ARE 
19:46:37 NO SPEAKERS, MOVE ON TO A VOTE.
19:46:38 
>> Councilmember Shao:   UNDERSTOOD.
19:46:38 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
19:46:45 
SO RIGHT NOW I SEE ONE PUBLIC SPEAKER 
19:46:45 RAISING HAND.
19:46:47 
AND THAT WOULD BE MR.
19:46:51  BLAIR BEEKMAN.
19:46:55 
SO LET'S HEAR WHAT MR.
19:46:59  BEEKMAN HAS TO SAY, AND WOULD I LIKE TO OPEN THE PUBLIC HEARING HERE.
19:47:06  I WOULD LIKE TO OPEN THE PUBLIC HEARING HERE.
19:47:09 
>> THANK YOU, BLAIR BEEKMAN FROM THE 
19:47:10 PUBLIC.
19:47:12 
WITH THIS ITEM WHAT TURNED OUT TO BE A 
19:47:18 LONG ITEM THE LAST ABOUT THE PUBLIC FUTURE OF BIKEWAYS AND WITH THE 530 
19:47:26 ITEM ABOUT THE FUTURE OF RAIL TRANSIT AND  BUS -- AND MASS TRANSIT IN SOUTH 
19:47:29 ALAMEDA
COUNTY, YOU KNOW, THIS IS I THINK OUR 
19:47:38 FIRST WEEK BACK FROM SUMMER BREAK FROM JUNE, AND I THINK WE'RE A LITTLE RUSTY.
19:47:42 
AND YOU KNOW, FOR THE ENVIRONMENTAL 
19:47:51 PROJECTS OF THE RAIL REPORT, FOR A FEW ITEMS OF HOW TO TALK ABOUT BETTER TALK 
19:47:55 ABOUT BICYCLE ISSUES AND FOR THESE LANDSCAPE ISSUES THEY ARE ALL ISSUES 
19:47:58 THAT THESE ARE
BIG MONEY PROJECTS.
19:48:01 
AND IT'S NICE TO HAVE MONEY AND IT'S 
19:48:06 JUST A MATTER OF WHAT DO WE DO WITH PUBLIC MONEY AND HOW DO WE TALK ABOUT 
19:48:09 IT WHEN HAVING GOOD PUBLIC MONEY.
19:48:11 
AND IT TAKES PRACTICE TO LEARN HOW TO 
19:48:16 DO THAT AND WE'LL GET BACK INTO THE SWING OF THINGS IN I GUESS A FEW WEEKS 
19:48:21 AND IT NEEDS A BIT MORE CONCENTRATION FROM YOURSELF IT SOUNDS LIKE AND GOOD 
19:48:23 LUCK WHAT
WE CAN DO.
19:48:27 
MEANWHILE EVERYBODY OFFERED SOME 
19:48:29 FAIRLY GOOD IDEAS AS USUALLY.
19:48:31 
IT'S A MATTER OF KNOWING HOW TO 
19:48:35 CONCENTRATE WITH WHAT TO DO WITH THE BUDGET AND FUNDING WE HAVE TILT.
19:48:40 
SO GOOD LUCK ON OUR CHOICES AND THANKS 
19:48:41 FOR YOUR TIME.
19:48:43 
>> Councilmember Shao:   THANK YOU MR.
19:48:44  BEEKMAN.
19:48:47 
I DO NOT SEE ANY OTHER PUBLIC SPEAKERS.
19:48:50 
THEREFORE, I'M GOING TO CLOSE THE

19:50:30 
THE CITY MASTER FEE SCHEDULE AND THE 
19:50:33 THE RECREATIONAL FEE USE POLICY.
19:50:35 
AGAIN OUR COMMUNITY SERVICES DIRECTOR 
19:50:38 SUZANNE WOLF IS MAKING HERSELF AVAILABLE FOR ANY QUESTIONS.
19:50:40 
SO FIRST QUESTIONS FROM THE COUNCIL.
19:50:45 
IN HAS COME BEFORE US BEFORE AND 
19:50:50 SEEING NONE, I'M GOING TO OPEN IT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD.
19:50:59 
FTC AND MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC MAY DO 
19:51:05 SO BY LITING ON THE RAISE HAND ICON OR --

19:51:07 >> The Clerk:   COUNCILMEMBER COX HAS HER HAND RAISED.
19:51:10 
>> Mayor Mei:   LET ME FIRST CLOSE THE 
19:51:11 PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD.
19:51:13 
SEEING NO PUBLIC COMMENT, LET ME CLOSE 
19:51:14 THE PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD.
19:51:15 
THANK YOU.
19:51:18 
I'LL RETURN IT BACK TO COMMENTS FROM 
19:51:19 COUNCILMEMBERS, COUNCILMEMBER COX.
19:51:20 
>> Councilmember Cox:   THANK YOU.
19:51:22 
I APPRECIATE ALL THE HARD WORK THAT 
19:51:25 WENT INTO PUTTING TOGETHER THE MASTER FEE SCHEDULE.
19:51:29 
I DID HAVE A COUPLE OF  QUESTIONS.
19:51:33 
ONE WAS, WHEN WAS THERE A STUDY DONE, 
19:51:38 I GUESS TO ASSESS THE NEEDS FOR HAVING A DOWNTOWN CENTER?
19:51:44 
BECAUSE I DIDN'T SEE ALL OF THAT IN 
19:51:45 PART OF THE PRESENTATION.
19:51:47 
WAS THAT SOMETHING THAT HAD PUBLIC 
19:51:57 HEARINGS OR THINGS ON THAT OR --
>> WITH ME THIS EVENING IS DEPUTY 
19:52:00 DIRECTOR KIM RYAN, I'LL ASK HER TO ANSWER THAT.
19:52:04 
WE DID VIEW OTHER CITIES IN ORDER TO 
19:52:08 SET UP THE FEES FOR THE NEW CENTER THAT'S COMING ON BOARD WITH THE 
19:52:08 DOWNTOWN EVENT CENTER.
19:52:10 
>> CORRECT.
19:52:13 
SO I'M NOT SURE COUNCILMEMBER COX IF 
19:52:17 YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT WHEN THE EVENT CENTER WAS ORIGINALLY APPROVED AS 
19:52:19 PHASE ONE --
>> Councilmember Cox:   NO ABOUT 
19:52:21 BEFORE THAT, I GUESS IT WAS BEFORE THAT.
19:52:23 
>> RIGHT, SO THAT WOULD BE THE CITY 
19:52:26 COUNCIL WENT THROUGH AND APPROVED THE DOWNTOWN PLAN.
19:52:32 
AND SO THAT WOULD HAVE GONE BACK TO 
19:52:32 THAT TIME FRAME.
19:52:35 
THAT WAS PART OF COMMUNITY SERVICES 
19:52:36 GETTING INVOLVED.
19:52:41 
I KNOW CLIFF AND DAN SCHOENHOLZ WHO 
19:52:42 WORKED ON THAT PLAN.
19:52:45 
>> Councilmember Cox:   IT WAS BACK IN 
19:52:48 2018 OR 2017 PART OF THAT TIME FRAME.
19:52:49 
>> CORRECT.
19:52:50 
>> Councilmember Cox:   I WANTED TO 
19:52:55 FIND OUT, IT SOUNDS VERY EXCITING AND LOOKS VERY BEAUTIFUL FROM THE OUTSIDE, 
19:52:58 CAN'T WAIT TO REOPEN IT UP.
19:53:02 
L I'D LIKE TO FIND OUT IN TERMS OF I 
19:53:06 NOTICE YOU HAVE DIFFERENT CLASSIFICATION FOR GENERAL USES AND 
19:53:14 THEN YOU HAVE DIFFERENT GROUPS THAT ARE DIVIDED INTO LIKE HAZARD 1, 2 OR 3.
19:53:21 
SO I WAS TRYING TO FIND OUT WITH THE 
19:53:26 HAZARD CLASSIFICATION, IS THAT SOMETHING COMING OUT OF INSURANCE 
19:53:28 INDUSTRY BACKGROUND HOW THEY BREAK THAT DOWN?
19:53:32 
I THOUGHT IT WAS INTERESTING THAT 
19:53:37 HAZARD LIKE SAY FOR EXAMPLE HAZARD 3 FOR HEADS OF STATE VERSUS DIFFERENT 
19:53:44 CLASSIFICATION NOR UNION MEETINGS, SO I WAS TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHERE WAS THE 
19:53:49 SOURCE THAT
THEN PROVIDED THAT HAZARDOUS BREAKDOWN?
19:53:50 
AND CLASSIFICATION?
19:53:51 
>> CORRECT.
19:53:54 
AS STAFF WAS DOING THEIR RESEARCH AS I 
19:53:57 SAID IN THE STAFF REPORT WE REALLY REALIZED THAT THE CITY OF FREMONT WAS 
19:54:01 ONE OF THE AGENCIES WHO WASN'T REQUIRING ANY INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS 
19:54:03 FOR OUR RENTERS OF
OUR FACILITIES.
19:54:05 
SO WE WENT THROUGH AND DID RESEARCH, 
19:54:21  UNDERSTOOD L WHAT OTHERS WERE PROVIDING.
19:54:24 
THE CALIFORNIA JOINT USE AUTHORITY 
19:54:26 OFFERS INSURANCE TO BE PURCHASED THROUGH THEM.
19:54:29 
THEY ARE THE ONES THAT OFFER THOSE 
19:54:33  CLASSICS.
19:54:39  CATION FICTIONS ARE.
19:54:45 
YOU ENTER IT I MADE UP A WEDDING AND 
19:54:49 ADDEDS AND IT SAID YOUR INSURANCE COSTS WILL BE $150.
19:54:50 
THAT'S HOW IT WORKS.
19:54:56 
YOU CAN OFTEN CAN CAN PROVIDE IT FOR 
19:54:58 YOUR HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE AS WELL.
19:54:59 
>> Councilmember Cox:   IF A PERSON 
19:55:03 DOESN'T HAVE THAT KIND OF COVERAGE THEY CAN PURCHASE IT OR USE THEIR OWN 
19:55:08 HOMEOWNERS AND GET THE QUOTE AND SHOW YOU IT'S BEING COVERED FOR THAT DAY OF 
19:55:08 THE EVENT?
19:55:09 
>> RIGHT.
19:55:10 
>> Councilmember Cox:   OKAY, COOL.
19:55:13 
THE OTHER THING I WAS GOING TO ASK IS 
19:55:25 WITH THE NEW CENTER IT WILL HAVE AUDIO, VISUAL AND  LIVE-STREAMING 
19:55:25 CAPABILITIES RIGHT?
19:55:26 
>> CORRECT.
19:55:34 
THE AUDIOVISUAL SYSTEM WILL BE ABLE TO 
19:55:36 BROADCAST COUNCIL MEETINGS TO IT.
19:55:39 
IT WILL HAVE FULL WiFi CAPABILITIES 
19:55:44 WHICH NONE OF OUR OTHER COMMUNITY CENTERS DO AND IT WILL ALSO HAVE TV 
19:55:49 SCREEN AND MONITORS THROUGHOUT THE FACILITY IN COUPLE OF LOCATIONS, THAT 
19:55:52 WILL BE INCLUDED
IN PART OF YOUR PACKAGE ONCE YOU RENT 
19:55:57 IT AND THERE MAY BE AN UPCHARGE ONCE WE GET A DEMONSTRATION OF WHAT THE 
19:55:58 CAPABILITIES ARE.
19:56:01 
>> Councilmember Cox:   THERE IS GOING 
19:56:05 TO BE SOME AMENDMENTS WHEN WE FIND OUT MORE INFORMATION TO THE FEES SCHEDULE, 
19:56:07 WILL THAT BE SOME ADJUSTMENTS THERE?
19:56:08 
>> POSSIBLY.
19:56:12 
SOMETIMES THOSE THINGS WE ADD ON IN 
19:56:17 THE CONDITIONS OF USE IF WE FIND THERE IS AN ADD ON FEE FOR THE CITY.
19:56:19 
IS THERE WILL BE A RENTAL FEE.
19:56:23 
>> Councilmember Cox:   WILL THE 
19:56:26 AUDIOVISUAL BE COVERED BY THE UNIONS?
19:56:30 
>> I ASSUME FOR THOSE WHO COVER THE 
19:56:32 REST OF THE CITY WHEN WE DO COUNCIL MEETINGS.
19:56:33 
>> Councilmember Cox:   ARE THEY UNION 
19:56:34 OR NONUNION?
19:56:35 
I DON'T KNOW.
19:56:36 
I WAS JUST ASKING.
19:56:39 
>> WE HAVE A CONTRACT WITH AN 
19:56:43 ORGANIZATION WHO PROVIDES SUPPORT FOR OUR CITY COUNCIL MEETINGS AND JOINT 
19:56:47 MEETINGS WITH THE SCHOOL DISTRICT, ET CETERA.
19:56:50 
IT'S NOT NECESSARILY A UNION CONTRACT 
19:56:53 BUT IT IS A COMPETITIVELY BID CONTRACT.
19:56:58 
BUT ON THE BACK END SUPPORT, OUR I.T.
19:57:02  DEPARTMENT IS ALWAYS IN THE BACKGROUND, AS THEY ARE TONIGHT, 
19:57:08 PROVIDING SUPPORT FOR THIS MEETING AND ANY OTHER BROADCAST THAT WE HAVE 
19:57:13  ALONG WITH
(INAUDIBLE).
19:57:15 
>> Councilmember Cox:   RIGHT, I KNOW 
19:57:20 ON OTHER FACILITIES IF YOU RENT THEM AT THE HOTEL YOU HAVE TO HAVE A CONTRACT 
19:57:21 THAT IS WORKING WITH THE UNION.
19:57:23 
SO I WAS JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND 
19:57:23 THAT PIECE.
19:57:26 
SO THAT WOULD BE ANOTHER THIRD PARTY 
19:57:33 TYPE ARRANGEMENT IN ADDITION TO WHAT WE'RE SEEING ON THE FEE SCHEDULE, CORRECT?
19:57:34 
SO THAT'S WHAT I'M HEARING.
19:57:36 
AND THIS IS GOING ACCREDITATION, WILL 
19:57:42 YOU HAVE ACCESS TO THE 5G TO BE ABLE TO CONDUCT ALL THESE THINGS FOR THE 
19:57:45 DOWNTOWN CENTER?
19:57:50 
IS THAT TAPPING INTO THE 5G ZONE OR 
19:57:50 NOT?
19:57:52 
>> STAFF DOESN'T HAVE THE FULL 
19:57:58 ORIENTATION ON THE AV EQUIPMENT.
19:58:02 
THE NEXT STEP IS WE CAN BE DRAINED ON 
19:58:06 THE THE CAPABILITIES AND WHAT THAT WILL ABOUT ENTAIL.
19:58:09  ENTAIL.
19:58:10 
>> Councilmember Cox:   GREAT, OKAY.
19:58:12 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, APPRECIATE ALL 
19:58:14 YOUR HELP.
19:58:20 
>> Mayor Mei:   SO ARE THERE ANY OTHER 
19:58:20 QUESTIONS?
19:58:23 
SEEING NONE, WOULD -- I SEE 
19:58:27 COUNCILMEMBER JONES YOU WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A MOTION, IT LOOKS LIKE -- OR DO 
19:58:29 YOU HAVE COMMENTS?
19:58:30 
>> Councilmember Jones:   I WOULD, I 
19:58:32 WOULD MOVE TO APPROVE THE ITEM.
19:58:34 
>> Mayor Mei:   AND SECONDED BY 
19:58:34 COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN.
19:58:37 
SO MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER JONES AND 
19:58:38 SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN.
19:58:41 
THANK YOU FOR THE  CLARIFICATIONS, 
19:58:43 ROLL CALL VOTE PLEASE.
19:58:46

CITY OF FREMONT REDISTRICTING 
19:59:23 INFORMATION.
19:59:25 
I WOULD LIKE TO WELCOME CHRISTIAN 
19:59:29 PARKS A CONSULTANT WITH NATIONAL DEMOGRAPHICS CORPORATION THIS EVENING 
19:59:30 WHO WILL PROVIDE US A PRESENTATION.
19:59:33 
THANK YOU.
19:59:38 
>> AND MAYOR MEI, CITY MANAGER'S 
19:59:43 OFFICE WILL PRESENTS A BRIEF INTRODUCTION.
19:59:45 
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU  AMANDA.
19:59:53 
>> GOOD EVENING, I'M AMANDA  GAYO, IN 
19:59:53 THE CITY MANAGER'S OFFICE.
19:59:57 
I WILL BE SERVING AS THE CITY'S POINT 
20:00:00 PERSON ON THE  REDISTRICTING SERVICE IN 2021.
20:00:02 
AND WE ARE BRINGING THIS ITEM TO YOU 
20:00:05 ALL TODAY TO REALLY JUST GIVE AN OVERVIEW OF WHAT THAT PROCESS WILL 
20:00:13 LOOK LIKE EVERY THE NEXT MONTHS TO INTRODUCE YOU TO  THE CONSULTANT THAT 
20:00:18 THE CITY HAS DECIDED
TO WORK WITH, NATIONAL DEMOGRAPHICS 
20:00:18 CORPORATION.
20:00:20 
AND REALLY, THIS PROCESS AS YOU MAY BE 
20:00:26 AWARE, THE CITY IS REQUIRED TO DO THIS AT THE CONCLUSION OF EVERY CENSUS.
20:00:27 
SO EVERY TEN YEARS.
20:00:30 
AND WE WILL REVIEW BASED ON THAT DATA 
20:00:39  MANY INFORMATION WHAT OUR COUNCIL DISTRICTS MAY BE.
20:00:42 
WITH THAT I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE 
20:00:43 KRISTIN PARKS.
20:00:46 
SHE WILL BE THE CITY'S REPRESENTATIVE 
20:00:52 FROM NATIONAL DEMOGRAPHICS CORPORATION.
20:00:56 
KRISTIN HAWTS GREAT EXPERIENCE AS DOES 
20:00:59 NATIONAL DEMOGRAPHICS CORPORATION ON REDISTRICTING.
20:01:02 
SHE IS CURRENTLY WORKING ON OHLONE 
20:01:08 COLLEGE DISTRICT'S REDISTRICTING THAT EXPANDS ACROSS FREMONT AS WELL, SHE IS 
20:01:12 KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT THE AREA AS WELL AS SAN MATEO COUNTY AND SANTA BARBARA AND 
20:01:14 OTHER
CONTRACTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE.
20:01:16 
SO I'M GOING TO NOW TURN IT OVER TO 
20:01:19 KRISTIN WHO WILL GIVE YOU MORE OF THAT PROCESS OVERVIEW.
20:01:20 
THANK YOU.
20:01:23 
>> THANK YOU, AMANDA AND GOOD EVENING 
20:01:25 MAYOR, COUNCIL, I'M HAPPY TO BE HERE.
20:01:28 
LET'S JUMP RIGHT INTO OUR  OVERVIEW OF 
20:01:32 THE REDISTRICTING PROCESS.
20:01:37 
YOU MAY RECALL THAT THE CITY OF 
20:01:40 FREMONT DID MOVE QUITE RECENTLY TO DISTRICT ELECTIONS.
20:01:42 
THAT HAPPENED IN 2017.
20:01:45 
SO WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TONIGHT IS 
20:01:45 REDISTRICTING.
20:01:47 
YOU ALREADY DID THE DISTRICTING PART.
20:01:53 
AND I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT THAT WHEN 
20:01:57 YOU MOVED TO DISTRICTS, YOU WERE DOING THAT USING INFORMATION FROM THE 2010 
20:01:59 CENSUS.
20:02:01 
SO THE REASON THAT WE ARE 
20:02:05 REDISTRICTING NOW IS BECAUSE WE WILL HAVE NEW DATA FROM THE 2020 CENSUS.
20:02:11 
HERE IS YOUR CURRENT DISTRICT MAP, 
20:02:13 YOU'RE ALL VERY FAMILIAR WITH THIS I'M SURE.
20:02:17 
AND OUR TIME LINE FOR 2021'S 
20:02:23 REDISTRICTING INTO 2022 ACKNOWLEDGE OF COURSE, IS THAT IF YOU WORK BACKWARDS, 
20:02:26 YOUR DEADLINE IS APRIL 17th OF NEXT YEAR.
20:02:29 
WHAT THAT MEANS IS, THAT BY THAT DATE 
20:02:35 YOU NEED TO ADOPT A NEW MAP THAT IS POPULATION BALANCED FOR THE SIX 
20:02:37 DISTRICTS IN YOUR CITY.
20:02:43 
WE HAVE LAUNCHED JUST THIS WEEK THE 
20:02:48 REDISTRICTING WEBSITE AND THE PUBLIC OUTREACH HAS ALREADY BEGUN AND WHAT WE 
20:02:51 ARE WAITING FOR BECAUSE OF ALL OF THE DELAYS AROUND THE

20:02:55 CENSUS, RESULTING FROM THE PANDEMIC, WE ARE WAITING FOR THE DATA.
20:02:59 
SO IN MID AUGUST, THE TOTAL POPULATION 
20:03:02 DATA FROM THE CENSUS BUREAU WILL BE RELEASED.
20:03:06 
HOWEVER, CALIFORNIA DOES NEED TO GO 
20:03:13 THROUGH A PROCESS OF  ADJUSTING THAT DATA AND REALLOCATING STATE PRISONERS 
20:03:15 BACK TO THEIR HONE COMMUNITIES.
20:03:18 
AND SO WE WON'T HAVE THE OFFICIAL 
20:03:20 CALIFORNIA DATA PROBABLY UNTIL THE END OF SEPTEMBER.
20:03:26 
UNDER THE NEW LEGAL FRAMEWORK THAT IS 
20:03:33  GUIDING THE 2021 REDISTRICTING, ALL CITIES ARE REQUIRED TO HOLD A MINIMUM 
20:03:35 OF FOUR PUBLIC HEARINGS.
20:03:38 
SO IN THE COMING WEEKS WE WILL BE 
20:03:42 FINALIZING THOSE DATES FOR FREMONT.
20:03:45 
BUT ONE OF THOSE HEARINGS HAS A TO 
20:03:47 OCCUR BEFORE ANY DRAFT DISTRICT MAPS ARE DRAWN.
20:03:50 
SO LIKELY THAT HEARING WILL OCCUR IN 
20:03:51 AUGUST OR SEPTEMBER.
20:03:55 
THERE WILL ALSO BE PLENTY OF TIME FOR 
20:04:01 MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROCESS AND SUBMIT THEIR OWN 
20:04:05 MAPS OF WHAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE SIX DISTRICTS LOOK LIKE.
20:04:09 
AND WE WILL HAVE A LULL OVER THE 
20:04:14 HOLIDAY OF COURSE, AND WE WILL COME BACK AND MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE AT 
20:04:24 LEAST TWO PUBLIC HEARINGS JANUARY, FEBRUARY OR MARCH, IN ORDER TO ALLOW 
20:04:28 TIME FOR THE COUNCIL AND
THE PUBLIC TO ANALYZE THE DRAFT MAPS, 
20:04:33 REVISE THEM, AND RECEIVE DEMOGRAPHIC REPORTS AS WELL AS ELECTION SEQUENCING 
20:04:37 FOR ALL OF THE MAPS THAT ARE CONSIDERED.
20:04:39 
AND I'M CONFIDENT THAT YOU WILL MEET 
20:04:47 YOUR APRIL DEADLINE AND THEN OF COURSE IN NOVEMBER, OF 2022, YOU HAVE 
20:04:54 DISTRICTS 2, 3 AND 4 UP FOR ELECTION, AND THOSE WILL BE THE FIRST -- THAT 
20:04:56 WILL BE THE
FIRST ELECTION WITH THE NEW DISTRICT 
20:04:57 MAP.
20:04:59 
SO THAT'S OUR TIME LINE.
20:05:00 
IT'S A LITTLE BIT COMPRESSED.
20:05:03 
I REFERENCED A NEW CALIFORNIA STATE 
20:05:08 LAW SO THIS IS THE LAW THAT IS NOW GOVERNING  REDISTRICTING IN THE STATE 
20:05:09 OF CALIFORNIA.
20:05:10 
I'M GOING TO COVER THAT.
20:05:13 
BUT IF YOU WERE AROUND FOR THE 
20:05:16 DISTRICTING PROCESS, THE FEDERAL LAWS HAVEN'T CHANGED.
20:05:19 
SO WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT 
20:05:24 REDISTRICTING, THE FIRST ABSOLUTE MANDATORY THING IS THAT WE COMPLY WITH 
20:05:25 FEDERAL LAW.
20:05:27 
FEDERAL LAW SAYS THAT EACH CITY 
20:05:32 COUNCIL DISTRICT SHOULD BE RELATIVELY EQUAL IN POPULATION SIZE.
20:05:36 
FEDERAL LAW SAYS THAT WHETHER WE'RE 
20:05:40 DISTRICTING WE MUST IMPLY WITH THE FEDERAL VOTING RIGHTS ACT AND NOT 
20:05:41 DILUTE MINORITY VOTES.
20:05:48 
WE ALSO MUST AVOID RACIAL 
20:05:55 GERRYMANDERING, SO THAT WHILE RACE IS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR TO CONSIDER, IT 
20:06:03 SHOULD NOT BE THE SOLE FACTOR BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE RACIAL GERRYMANDERING.
20:06:05 
THE CALIFORNIA FAIR MAPS ACT GIVERS 
20:06:11 CITIES A RANKED LIST OF CRITERIA THAT MUST BE CONSIDERED WHEN DRAWING 
20:06:14 DISTRICT LINES DURING THE REDISTRICTING  PROCESS.
20:06:21 
SO THESE FOUR RANKED CRITERIA ARE 
20:06:25 FIRST TO ENSURE THAT DISTRICTS ARE CONTIGUOUS, MEANING EACH DISTRICT IS 
20:06:31 ONE PIECE THAT IS CONNECTED TO ITSELF AND NOT BROKEN INTO ISLANDS.
20:06:35 
THE SECOND CRITERION IS TO MINIMIZE 
20:06:41 THE DIVISION OF NEIGHBORHOODS AND COMMUNITIES OF INTEREST ACROSS 
20:06:41 DISTRICT BOUNDARIES.
20:06:53 
NUMBER 3 IS TO CREATE EASILY CAN 
20:07:00 CREATED BOUNDARIES, SO THEY CAN DESCRIBE WHERE ONE DISTRICT BEGINS AND 
20:07:02 WHERE ONE ENDS.
20:07:06 
A MEASURE FOR COMPACTNESS, THE STATE 
20:07:17 LAW SAYS YOU SHOULD NOT BYPASS A NEAR POPULATION TO THE BOUNDARIES SHALL 
20:07:20 SHALL NOT FAVOR OR DISCRIMINATE AGAINST A POLITICAL PARTY.
20:07:23 
SO THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE 
20:07:24 TO FOLLOW.
20:07:28 
I'VE ALSO INCLUDED SOME OF THE MORE 
20:07:32 TRADITIONAL PRINCIPLES HERE THAT HAVE GUIDED REDISTRICTING.
20:07:34 
BECAUSE THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT 
20:07:37 YOU'RE PROBABLY IN THE BACK OF YOUR HEAD, RIGHT?
20:07:40 
WANTING TO MINIMIZE CHANGES TO 
20:07:41 ELECTION CYCLES, RIGHT?
20:07:44 
YOU DON'T WANT ANY OF YOUR VOTERS WHO 
20:07:50 ARE EXPECTING TO VOTE IN 2022, TO HAVE TO VOTE IN 2024 JUST BECAUSE LINES 
20:07:51 MOVED ON A MAP.
20:07:54 
RIGHT?
20:07:58 
SIMILARLY, TRADITIONALLY, WE DO TRY TO 
20:08:06 RESPECT VOTERS' CHOICES AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS GIVING VOTERS DECISION ON 
20:08:12 WHETHER OR NOT THEIR COUNCILMEMBER IS REELECTED AND NOT MOVING

20:08:13 LINES.
20:08:19 
TRYING TO MAINTAIN THE DISTRICT LINES, 
20:08:24 YOUR DISTRICTS HAVE BEEN ALREADY NEW BUT YOU HAVE BEEN ORGANIZING IN THEM 
20:08:28 AND HAVE COMMUNITY MEMBERS IDENTIFY WITH THEM.
20:08:31 
IDENTIFYING FUTURE GROWTH IS SOMETHING 
20:08:35 WE SHOULD CONSIDER BUT WHAT I NEED TO POINT OUT TO YOU IS THESE OTHER GOALS 
20:08:39 CAN ONLY BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT AFTER COMPLYING WITH FEDERAL AND STATE LAW 
20:08:42 AND IN SO
FAR AS THESE OTHER GOALS DO NOT 
20:08:45 CONFLICT WITH FEDERAL OR STATE LAW.
20:08:48 
SO I KNOW THAT'S A LOT BUT THAT'S AA 
20:08:49 BRIEF LEGAL OVERVIEW.
20:08:51 
I'M HAPPY AS SOON AS I'M DONE TO 
20:08:55 ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE ON IN OR ANYTHING.
20:08:58  THIS OR ANYTHING.
20:09:01 
FOR THE PURPOSE OF MINIMIZING THE 
20:09:05 DIVISION OF NEIGHBORHOODS AND COMMUNITIES OF INTEREST, IT'S 
20:09:08 IMPORTANT THAT WE DEFINE THOSE TWO TERMS.
20:09:12 
A NEIGHBORHOOD OF COURSE CAN BE 
20:09:19 DEFINED OBJECTIVELY BY USING OFFICIAL NEIGHBORHOODS RECOGNIZED BY THE CITY 
20:09:22 OR BY RECEIVING TESTIMONY FROM THE PUBLIC.
20:09:25 
AND SO NEIGHBORHOODS MOST PEOPLE CAN 
20:09:26 WRAP THEIR HEADS AROUND.
20:09:29 
WHAT WE LIKE TO EXPLAIN A LITTLE BIT 
20:09:32 MORE IN DEPTH IS COMMUNITIES OF INTEREST.
20:09:35 
AND THE WAY THAT CALIFORNIA LAW 
20:09:39 DEFINES A COMMUNITY OF INTEREST IS THAT IT'S A POPULATION THAT SHARES COMMON 
20:09:45 SOCIAL OR ECONOMIC INTERESTS, AND SHOULD BE INCLUDED WITHIN A SINGLE 
20:09:48 COUNCIL DISTRICT FOR
PURPOSES OF FAIR AND EFFECTIVE 
20:09:49 REPRESENTATION.
20:09:53 
SO THERE ARE MANY EXAMPLES OF WHAT A 
20:09:55 COMMUNITY OF INTEREST IS.
20:09:58 
I LIKE TO EXPLAIN THAT A COMMUNITY OF 
20:10:01 INTEREST IS SMALLER THAN YOUR DISTRICT.
20:10:05 
YOUR DISTRICT WILL BE MADE UP OF MANY 
20:10:08 COMMUNITIES OF INTEREST AT MULTIPLE NEIGHBORHOODS.
20:10:10 
SO THESE COMMUNITIES OF INTEREST ARE 
20:10:14 OVERLAPPING SETS OF NETWORKS AND GROUPS OF PEOPLE THAT SHARE INTERESTS, 
20:10:17 CULTURE, HISTORY, LANGUAGE, AND VALUES.
20:10:19 
AND THAT CAN BE IDENTIFIED 
20:10:24 GEOGRAPHICALLY ON A MAP.
20:10:27 
SO WHEN WE ARE ASKING THE PUBLIC TO 
20:10:31 BRING TESTIMONY AND DEFINE OR MAP THEIR COMMUNITY OF INTEREST, WE ASK THEM NOT 
20:10:35 ONLY FOR THOSE CHARACTERISTICS THAT BRING THEM TOGETHER IN THEIR COMMUNITY 
20:10:38 BUT ALSO
THE PHYSICAL BOUNDARIES WHICH CAN BE 
20:10:45 ROADS, WATERWAYS, HILLS, LANDMARKS, AREAS AROUND PARKS OR SCHOOLS.
20:10:47 
AND WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT 
20:10:52 REDISTRICTING WE'RE PRIMARILY INTERESTED IN IDENTIFYING THOSE 
20:10:54 COMMUNITIES THAT DO NOT WANT TO BE DIVIDED.
20:10:57 
OF COURSE, WITH FOUR PUBLIC HEARINGS 
20:11:03 THIS GIVES US PLENTY OF OPPORTUNITY TO HEAR FROM MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC AS TO 
20:11:04 THEIR COMMUNITIES OF INTEREST.
20:11:11 
YOU ALREADY HAVE A RICH SET OF MAPS 
20:11:16 THAT YOU HAVE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE, LOTS OF WAYS THAT'S PUBLIC CAN LOOK TO 
20:11:22 IDENTIFY THEIR COMMUNITIES OF INTEREST, NATIONAL DEMOGRAPHICS CORPORATION WILL 
20:11:26 ALSO BE
PROVIDING YOU ADDITIONAL DEMOGRAPHIC 
20:11:33 INFORMATION ON RACE, ETHNICITY, INCOME, FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN, ALL KINDS OF 
20:11:39 DIFFERENT THINGS THAT YOU AND MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC CAN USE TO IDENTIFY 
20:11:42 COMMUNITIES OF
INTEREST.
20:11:46 
AND WE ALSO HAVE TWO PUBLIC MATCHING 
20:11:49 TOOLS THAT WILL BE USED THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS.
20:11:54 
THE FIRST ONE, YOU MAY HAVE USED IT 
20:11:56 BEFORE, IN PART OF THE DISTRICTING PROCESS.
20:12:00 
BUT IT IS A VERY EASY ONLINE TOOL 
20:12:01 CALLED DISTRICT R.
20:12:05 
AND I'LL SHOW YOU A SCREEN SHOT IN A 
20:12:05 SECOND.
20:12:09 
THE SECOND ONE IS ALMOST IDENTICALLY, 
20:12:13 THE PAPER PARTICIPATION KIT IS FOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T WANT DO USE A 
20:12:18 COMPUTER OR DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THE INTERNET SO THEY CAN ALSO DRAW MAPS.
20:12:22 
SO DISTRICT R IS A PAINTBRUSH TOOL.
20:12:25 
SO WHAT YOU'RE SEEING IS AN EXAMPLE 
20:12:26 FROM ANOTHER CITY.
20:12:29 
BUT IT IS A VERY SIMPLE INTERFACE 
20:12:34 WHERE YOU SIMPLY CLICK TON PAINTBRUSH AND YOU CAN DRAG ARE IT OVER CITY 
20:12:40 BLOCKS, CENSUS BLOCKS, AND YOU CAN DEFINE IN THAT WAY YOUR COMMUNITY OF 
20:12:41 INTEREST, OR YOUR
DISTRICT.
20:12:47 
SO YOU CAN USING THE TOOL IN BOTH OF 
20:12:52 THOSE WAYS AND THAT TOOL WILL BE AVAILABLE ON THE REDISTRICT FREMONT.
20:12:53 ORG WEBSITE WITHIN THE NEXT MONTH.
20:13:00 
SIMILARLY, WE DO CREATE A PAPER KIT 
20:13:09 THAT IS USUALLY A LARGER PAPER MAP THAT PEOPLE CAN ACTUALLY DRAW ON WITH A 
20:13:12 LITTLE QUESTIONNAIRE ON THE BACK ASKING THEM TO EXPLAIN WHY THEY DREW THE 
20:13:14 LINES
WHERE THEY DID.
20:13:20 
AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE CAN 
20:13:25 TAKE WITH THEM, TAKE IT HOME MAIL IT BACK, DAY A DPOAT, E-MAIL THE PHOTO, 
20:13:26 HOWEVER THEY WANT TO DO IT.
20:13:29 
SOME PEOPLE JUST FREEFER TO DO IT THE 
20:13:33 OLD FASHIONED WAY AND WE WANT TO SUPPORT THAT IN TERMS OF ACCESSIBILITY 
20:13:36 FOR EVERYONE IN THE COMMUNITY.
20:13:39 
THERE IS ALSO AN EXCEL SETTLEMENTS FOR 
20:13:45 FOLKS WHO WANT TO USE A PAPER MAP BUT ALSO WANT TO DIG INTO THAT POPULATION 
20:13:53  DATA, AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE DRAWING DISTRICTS THAT ARE EQUAL IN

20:13:57 POPULATION SIZE AND FOR REDISTRICTING FOR CITIES THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE 
20:13:58 EXACTLY EQUAL.
20:14:00 
WE'RE ACTUALLY LOOKING FOR A TOTAL 
20:14:02 DEVIATION OF LESS THAN  10%.
20:14:05 
I LOOKED AT THE PRELIMINARY NUMBERS 
20:14:05 FOR FREMONT.
20:14:08 
WE DON'T HAVE THE OFFICIAL NUMBERS YET.
20:14:09 
AND IT LOOKS LIKE RIGHT NOW YOU'RE 
20:14:12 SORT OF JUST BARELY HITTING THAT 10%.
20:14:16 
SO WE'LL SEE, THAT WILL CHANGE WHEN WE 
20:14:19 GET THE FINAL POPULATION DATA.
20:14:23 
AND FINALLY, WE LOOK FORWARD TO 
20:14:27 LETTING THE PUBLIC KNOW ABOUT THE UPCOMING PUBLIC HEARINGS, TO 
20:14:29 PARTICIPATE IN THE PROCESS.
20:14:31 
WE LOOK FORWARD TO LAUNCHING THE 
20:14:36 ONLINE MAPPING TOOL AND THE PAPER MAPPING TOOL, AND THERE'S A BEAUTIFUL 
20:14:44 LOGO THAT HAS BEEN DESIGNED BY YOUR STAFF, AND SO THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF 
20:14:47 WHAT WILL BE A
RELATIVELY COMPRESSED PROCESS.
20:14:48 
BUT I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING 
20:14:50 WHERE YOU ALL AS WE MOVE FORWARD.
20:14:54 
THANK YOU, AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY 
20:14:58 QUESTIONS THAT COUNCILMEMBERS OR THE MAYOR MAY HAVE.
20:15:00 
>> GREAT, THANK YOU KRISTIN.
20:15:03 
AND JUST AS A REMINDER, THERE IS NO 
20:15:05 FORMAL ACTION NEEDED TO BE TAKEN TONIGHT.
20:15:07 
WE JUST WANTED TO GIVE YOU AN OVERVIEW 
20:15:08 OF THE PROCESS.
20:15:11 
AND AS KRISTIN MENTIONED THERE WILL BE 
20:15:13 UPCOMING PUBLIC HEARINGS BEGINNING IN THE FALL.
20:15:16 
SO OPEN TO ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU ALL 
20:15:16 MAY HAVE.
20:15:19 
>> Mayor Mei:   YES.
20:15:24 
AT THIS TIME, I'D LIKE TO CALL ON ANY 
20:15:26 OF THE COUNCILMEMBERS TO SEE IF THEY HAVE A CLARIFYING YES.
20:15:35 
SEEING NONE, I'D LIKE TO BRING IT BACK 
20:15:40 TO THE THE PUBLIC COMMENT AND I'D LIKE TO OPEN THE PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD AND 
20:15:43 THE FIRST SPEAKER I SEE IS BLAIR BEEKMAN.
20:15:43 
THANK YOU.
20:15:47 
>> HI.
20:15:52 
BLAIR BEEKMAN HERE.
20:15:53 
THANK YOU FOR THIS ITEM.
20:15:56 
IT WAS NICE TO LEARN ABOUT.
20:15:59 
I'M LIVING IN OR NOT LIVING IN BUT I 
20:16:01 DO A LOT OF WORK IN SAN JOSE.
20:16:03 
AND THEY'RE GOING THROUGH A VERY 
20:16:08 SERIOUS REDISTRICTING PROCESS THAT'S HAVING A WHOLE TASK FORCE COMMITTEE, 
20:16:10 IT'S AN OPEN PUBLIC PROCESS.
20:16:18 
IT COULD BE GOOD LEARNING EXPERIENCE 
20:16:21 FOR YOURSELVES WHAT THEY'RE DOING.
20:16:25 
LONG BEACH IS OFTEN USED AS AN EXAMPLE 
20:16:28 KIND OF IN WAYS WHAT NOT TO DO.
20:16:31 
AND SAN JOSE IS IMPROVING UPON THAT 
20:16:37 CONCEPT AND HOW TO WORK TOWARDS MORE EQUITABLE WAYS OF THE FUTURE OF 
20:16:37 REDISTRICTING.
20:16:41 
I MEAN I GUESS THAT'S THE TERM NOW, 
20:16:45 BUT HOW DO WE CONSIDER THE MANY DIFFERENT CULTURES AND GROUPS THAT ARE 
20:16:46 WITHIN A CITY?
20:16:48 
AND SAN JOSE IS DEVELOPING SOME 
20:16:50 INTERESTING WAYS TO DO THAT AT THIS TIME.
20:16:57 
AND I'M VERY MUCH FOR, YOU KNOW, I 
20:17:02 THINK THIS CAN REALLY BE A DECADE OF DEFINING GOOD VOTING RIGHTS FOR 
20:17:02 OURSELVES.
20:17:04 
AND SO IT CAN BE A REAL  INTERESTING 
20:17:05 TIME.
20:17:08 
GOOD LUCK IN THIS WORK AND EFFORTS.
20:17:12 
I KNOW IN FREMONT TO FIND LIKE 
20:17:17 POPULATION, YOU KNOW,  PROJECTIONS FOR THE NEXT TEN YEARS AND POSSIBLY SOME 
20:17:20 ECONOMIC MODELS, LOOK TO THE FREMONT UNION SCHOOL DISTRICT.
20:17:22 
THEY TALK ABOUT THESE THINGS IN THEIR 
20:17:24 PUBLIC MEETINGS OFTEN.
20:17:27 
AND THEY'RE EXPECTING SOMEWHAT OF A 
20:17:31 DECLINE IN POPULATION OVER THE NEXT DECADE AND THERE COULD BE A NUMBER OF 
20:17:32 FACTORS.
20:17:34 
ECONOMIC AND OTHERWISE.
20:17:39 
I YOU KNOW, I'M LIKE THAT LONE PERSON 
20:17:44 THERE AT THIS TIME, HAVE TO USE THOSE SORT OF WORDS, BUT DID I BRING UP THE 
20:17:49 POINT THAT WE MAY POSSIBLY BE HAVING A LARGE NATURAL DISASTER IN THE NEXT FEW 
20:17:52 YEARS
HOPEFULLY THAT CAN WORK IN TO, YOU 
20:17:56 KNOW, HOWEVER YOU NEED TO THINK OF THIS SITUATION AND PLAN FOR THE NEXT TEN 
20:18:00 YEARS AND LIKE, FOR INSTANCE, IF WE ARE HAVING A LARGE EARTHQUAKE IN THE NEXT 
20:18:04 FEW YEARS,
YOU CAN PLAN FOR THAT INTO YOUR 
20:18:05 REDISTRICTING PLANS AND MAPS.
20:18:07 
I DON'T KNOW HOW ACCURATE THAT SORT OF 
20:18:13 INFORMATION IS, BUT IT'S SOMETHING YOU CAN WORK OFF OF AND FIGURE OUTS FOR 
20:18:20  OUT FOR YOURSELF HOW CORRECT IT IS AND GO FROM THERE.
20:18:24 
THAT'S MY HELP AND ADVICE AND GOOD 
20:18:29 LUCK HOW FREMONT WILL BE REDISTRICTING THEMSELVES FOR THIS NEXT DECADE AND 
20:18:33 WE'RE PAST THE TRUMP ERA AND THIS SHOULD BE THE TIME WE CAN REALLY BE 
20:18:37 OPEN AND HONEST
WITH EACH OTHER THAT WE CAN HAVE GOOD 
20:18:40 PRACTICES IN VOTING AND IT'S A GOOD EXPERIENCE.
20:18:43 
I THINK WE PROVED THAT'S POSSIBLE AND 
20:18:46 I HOPE WE WORKED TOWARDS THOSE GOOD STEPS IN THIS COMING DECADE.
20:18:48 
THANK YOU.
20:18:49 
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.
20:18:53 
THE NEXT PUBLIC SPEAKER IS GOING TO BE 
20:18:55 CEAM ABRIEU.
20:18:56 
WELCOME.
20:18:59 
>> ON THE ISSUE OF REDISTRICTING IS 
20:19:00 VERY INTERESTING.
20:19:04 
AND I'M NOT SPEAKING APPROACHING THE 
20:19:05 ISSUE ALL BY MYSELF.
20:19:08 
WE DO HAVE A COALITION.
20:19:11 
THE ALAMEDA COUNTY COALITION FOR FAIR 
20:19:15 REDISTRICTING IS ADDRESSING THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER TALKED BE ABOUT SOME 
20:19:22 PLACE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THAT IS SOME KIND OF EXAMPLE OF AMAZINGLY BAD 
20:19:25 DISTRICTING,
GERRYMANDERED DISTRICTING, WELL, I 
20:19:28 GIVE YOU THE ALAMEDA COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS.
20:19:31 
THE -- FOR EXAMPLE, HALF OF FREMONT IS 
20:19:32 DIVIDED.
20:19:35 
IN FREMONT WE HAVE A CONCEPT OF THE 
20:19:38 TRICITY BUT THAT CONCEPT IS NOT RESPECTED IN THE DISTRICT MAPS.
20:19:41 
IT COMBINES -- WE ARE COMBINING 
20:19:43 FREMONT WITH LIVERMORE.
20:19:45 
ANDTHE TRIVALLEY THEY HAVE A CONCEPT 
20:19:50 OF THE TRIVALLEY BUT THAT'S NOT RESPECTED BY THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS 
20:19:53 OF ALAMEDA COUNTY.
20:20:01 
THE EDEN, EDEN IS AN HISTORICAL AREA 
20:20:07 AND THE AREAS AROUND IT, THAT'S NOT RESPECTED BY THEIR LEADERS EITHER.
20:20:12 
THE CITY OF FREMONT WHEN IT 
20:20:14 REDISTRICTED CAME UP WITH A FEDERATE GOOD RESULT.
20:20:16 
HOWEVER THERE IS ONE GLARING ERROR IN 
20:20:23 THE MAP OR A GERRYMANDERED PORTION OF THE  MAP.
20:20:27 
WHICH HAS BEEN -- WHICH HAS BEEN 
20:20:28 PAPERED OVER.
20:20:33 
THERE ARE REDISTRICTING EXPERTS ALL 
20:20:33 OVER THE PLACE.
20:20:38 
I HAVE HEARD SO MANY LECTURES AND 
20:20:43 TALKS ABOUT REDISTRICTING USING THE EXAMPLE OF FREMONT'S MAP AND POINTING 
20:20:49 TO THE DIVISION OF CENTERVILLE OF GLENMOOR, THE SPLITS OF GLENMOOR AS 
20:20:52 BEING SOME KIND OF --
DRIVEN BY DID ASIAN COMMUNITY.
20:20:55 
BUT IF YOU GO BACK AND LOOK AT THE OLD 
20:20:59 MAP YOU'LL SEE THAT THE ASIAN COMMUNITY AT THAT TIME, SOME OF THEIR LEGAL 
20:21:02 REPRESENTATIVES SAID THAT THEY SUPPORTED THE CLEANER MAP.
20:21:03 
AND WHEREAS DID CLEANER MAP?
20:21:06 
IT IS NOT ON THE CITY WEBSITE  YOU 
20:21:09 KNOW THAT THE CITY OF FREMONT IS REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN MAPS FOR TEN 
20:21:13 YEARS, AND I SHOULD BE ABLE TO GO TO THE CITY WEBSITE WHICH I JUST DID AND 
20:21:17 LOOK FOR OLD MAPS NOT
JUST THE ADOPTED MAP.
20:21:22 
BUT ALL THOSE MAP PROPOSALS.
20:21:24 
THEY HAVE DISAPPEARED FROM THE MAPS.
20:21:27 
I HAD TO GO DIG THEM IDENTITY OF THE 
20:21:28 INTERNET.
20:21:29 
CITY OF FREMONT NEEDS TO RESTORE THE 
20:21:37 MAPS, PUT THEM ON THE MAPS, THAT DISTRICTS 2 AND DISTRICT 3 NEEDS TO BE 
20:21:37 CLEANED UP.
20:21:40 
THERE WAS A MAP THAT HAD A CLEAN 
20:21:41 VERSION OF THAT.
20:21:45 
GLENMOOR NEEDS TO BE NOT  DIVIDED, 
20:21:47 NEEDS TO BE SLIPPED ON A RATIONAL BASIS.
20:21:49 
THIS IS A SLIPPERY SLOPE.
20:21:52 
ONCE YOU START AGENDAINGS A BIT LIKE 
20:21:58 WE DID FOUR YEARS AGO LIKE DISTRICT 4 AND DISTRICT 3, IT WILL END UP JUST AS 
20:22:01 BAD AS THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS OF ALAMEDA COUNTY.
20:22:02 
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.
20:22:04 
AND AT THIS TIME I'M GOING TO TURN IT 
20:22:06 BACK TO THE COUNCIL FOR A CONVERSATION ON THIS TOPIC.
20:22:08 
IF THERE'S ANY OTHER COMMENTS.
20:22:10 
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN.
20:22:11 
>> Councilmember Kassan:   YES, I JUST 
20:22:18 HAVE TO SAY I REALLY DO AGREE WITH KELLY, THAT LINE IS DRAWN IS PRETTY 
20:22:18 DARN STRANGE.
20:22:23 
AND ANYONE WHO LISTENS BACK TO THE 
20:22:27 CONVERSATION BEST WHERE TO DRAW IT WILL PROBABLY KNOW WHY IT WAS DRAWN THE WAY 
20:22:28 IT WAS DRAWN.
20:22:30 
I'LL JUST LEAVE IT THERE BUT IT WASN'T 
20:22:32 REALLY THE RIGHT THING TO DID.
20:22:34 
AND I HOPE IT WILL BE CORRECTED THIS 
20:22:37 TIME AROUND, THANK YOU.
20:22:39 
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.
20:22:41 
I DON'T SEE ANY OTHER COMMENTS FROM 
20:22:42 THE COUNCILMEMBERS.
20:22:45 
I'LL MAKE A GENERAL COMMENT WHICH IS 
20:22:50 THAT THAT WAS OUR FIRST TIME I THINK AND IT'S BEEN A VERY CHALLENGING 
20:22:55 PROCESS IN THE PAST WHEN WE HAD TO THE SUDDENLY MOVE FROM AT LARGE TO 
20:22:56 DISTRICT ELECTIONS.
20:22:59 
BUT IT WAS ONE THAT I WOULD FULLY 
20:23:01 SUPPORT AGAIN THAT WE DO OUR BEST IN TERMS OF OUTREACH.
20:23:04 
I KNOW THAT ONE OF MY BIGGEST CONCERNS 
20:23:08 IS THAT WE REACH OUR COMMUNITIES OF FAITH AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND 
20:23:14 ALSO JUST IN GENERAL WITH ALSO WORKING PARTNERING WITH A LOT OF OUR LOCAL 
20:23:16 COMMUNITY BASED
ORGANIZATIONS TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE 
20:23:22 ARE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY AND AFFORDED THAT PARTICIPATION OPPORTUNITIES.
20:23:25 
THAT MEANS WORKING WITH DIFFERENT 
20:23:29 LANGUAGES, AND I THINK LAST TIME WE HAD OVER EIGHT LANGUAGES WHERE WE DID 
20:23:33 OUTREACH AND THEN ALSO IN TERMS OF WE HAVE THE SCHOOL FOR THE DEAF AND THE 
20:23:33 SCHOOL FOR THE
BLIND.
20:23:36 
SO I LIKE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE 
20:23:40 DOING OUTREACH AND ALL DIFFERENT OPTIONS TO MAKE SURE FROM THE PUBLIC 
20:23:43 AND I STRONGLY ENCOURAGE MY COUNCILMEMBERS AND THOSE WHO ARE 
20:23:46 WATCHING TO HELP US FACILITATE THE
AWARENESS OF THIS PROCESS.
20:23:48 
IT IS A LITTLE BIT HINDERED THIS TIME 
20:23:54 BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT WE ARE AWAITING THE CENSUS DATA.
20:23:56 
BUT WHEN THAT BECOMES AVAILABLE AND AS 
20:24:00 WE HAVE THE SCHEDULE AGAIN I KNOW THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE PUTSING THIS ON OUR 
20:24:04 WEBSITE, WE ALREADY HAVE BUT I WOULD ECHO THE SENTIMENT FROM THE PUBLIC ON 
20:24:08 TERMS OF
IF THERE ARE PAST MAPS THAT WE CAN 
20:24:08 PROVIDE THOSE.
20:24:14 
BUT CERTAINLY THESE PAST MAPS THAT 
20:24:17 WERE PRESENTED MAY NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE CHANGES WE ARE SEEING IN 
20:24:21 SOME OF THE FEDERAL GUIDELINES, THE NEW GUIDELINES THAT HAVE BEEN PUT INTO THE 
20:24:26 
INTO PLACE IN TERMS OF THE CALIFORNIA 
20:24:32 FAIR MAP ACT, AND EVEN THOUGH THOSE WERE PROPOSALS IN THOSE TIMES THEY MAY 
20:24:35 NOT BE REFLECTIVE OF THE POLICIES THAT MAY HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED HENCE.
20:24:38 
SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ADAPT 
20:24:39 TO THOSE.
20:24:42 
SO I REALLY THANK ALL OF YOU FOR THIS 
20:24:42 PRESENTATION.
20:24:45 
THANK YOU TO OUR MANAGEMENT ANALYST 
20:24:54 AMANDA GAIO AND ALSO FOR KRISTIN PARKS FOR THE PRESENTATION THIS EVENING.
20:24:57 
WITH THAT I WAS GOING TO SAY I'M NOT 
20:24:58 SURE IF THERE IS ANY OTHER COMMENTS.
20:25:00 
I WANTED TO MAKE ONE GENERAL COMMENT 
20:25:05 WHICH IS THAT I WANT TO SEND MY BEST HOPES AND GODSPEED TO OUR TEAMS THAT 
20:25:06 ARE OUT RIGHT NOW.
20:25:09 
WE HAVE TWO TEAMS OF OUR FIRE 
20:25:11 DEPARTMENT THAT ARE OUT WITH A STRIKE TEAM.
20:25:14 
AND FOR ALL THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS IN OUR 
20:25:17 SURROUNDING AREAS WHO ARE FACING SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE FACED LAST 
20:25:22 YEAR MY HEART GOES OUT TO ALL OF THEM AND I'M VERY APPRECIATIVE TO THEIR 
20:25:25 COLLEAGUES
AND FOR OUR ABILITY TO SUPPORT OTHERS 
20:25:27 AT THIS  MOMENT.
20:25:29 
AND FINALLY IF YOU HAVE NOT GOTTEN 
20:25:31 THROUGH THE VACCINATION PROCESS PLEASE DO SO.
20:25:33 
I WANTED TO SHARE REAL BRIEFLY THIS 
20:25:37 EERVEG THAT I'M REALLY PLEASED TO SEE THAT OUR CITY HAS REACHED ANOTHER 
20:25:42 THRESHOLD WHICH I THINK IS IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE BEEN STRIVING FOR AND I'M 
20:25:44 VERY PROUD THAT
WE ARE TAKING ON THE U.S.
20:25:48  CONFERENCE OF MAYORS CHALLENGE AND ALSO THE WHITE HOUSE AND PRESIDENT 
20:25:53 BIDEN AND WE ARE JUST PAST 90% FOR ONE SHOT IN THE ARM AND WE ARE AT OVER  
20:25:55 76% FULLY VACCINATED.
20:25:58 
WHICH IS IMPORTANT AS AN OPPORTUNITY 
20:26:04 AND I WOULD SAY THAT FOR THOSE WHO HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO DO SO, TO REACH OUT 
20:26:10 TO THEIR AHEALTH CARE PROVIDERS AND I THANK ALL THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE L 
20:26:15 PARTNERED WITH
US, WHETHER IT IS HELLER'S PHARMACY, 
20:26:20 THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN HELPING US I WOULD ALSO RECOMMEND AND ENCOURAGE PEOPLE 
20:26:24 THAT THEY STILL NEED TO BE GETTING TESTED IF THEY NEEDED TO BE SURE 
20:26:25 BECAUSE THIS IS A
GOING TO BE KEY TO US.
20:26:28 
THANK YOU TO ALL OF THOSE WHO ARE 
20:26:30 HELPING US TO SLOWLY REOPEN.
20:26:33 
LAST WEEK WE HAD OUR FIRST ACTIVE 
20:26:37 FREMONT EVENT AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THE NEXT ONES THAT ARE COMING AND I 
20:26:41 ENCOURAGE PEOPLE THE GET OUT AND GET FRESH AIR AND EXERCISE AND TO GET FIT 
20:26:44 WITH ALL OF US
AND GETTING TO KNOW YOUR NEIGHBORS IN 
20:26:45 YOUR DISTRICTS.
20:26:47 
AND I KNOW EACH OF MY COUNCILMEMBERS 
20:26:51 ARE TAKING ON SOME OF THESE CHALLENGES AND ENCOURAGING ALL OF YOU TO JOIN.
20:26:53 
WE ALSO HAD OUR FIRST FREMONT STREET 
20:26:58 EATS WHICH IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR US TO BE ABLE TO BRING BACK SOME OF THE 
20:27:03 SUPPORT FOR OUR TRUCKS, FOOD TRUCKS AS WELL AS OUR LOCAL BUSINESSES AND THEN 
20:27:07 THIS THURSDAY
EVENING, I HOPE SOME OF YOU WILL JOIN 
20:27:14 ME AT THE PARKS FOR OUR FIRST IN OUR SUMMER CONCERT SERIES.
20:27:16 
SO I JUST WANT TO ENCOURAGE ALL OF YOU 
20:27:21 THAT WE CAN WORK TOGETHER TO BE SAFE BE WELL AND BE HEALTHY.
20:27:23 
SO WITH THAT I WOULD CLOSE THE MEETING 
20:27:25 TO CLOSE AT 8:27 P.M.
20:27:29 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, BE SAFE AND STAY HEALTHY.
