[Captioner] 19:12:28
 COUNCILPERSONS.
THANK

[Captioner] 19:12:32
 YOU, THAT CERTAIN NEW
COUNCILPERSONS ARE NOW ON THE
FREMONT CITY COUNCIL.


[Captioner] 19:12:36
I THINK I'VE SEEN PREVIOUS WORK
OF --

[Captioner] 19:12:39
 I CAN'T REMEMBER HER LAST
NAME, I'M VERY

[Captioner] 19:12:42
 SORRY, BUT DESRIE
CAMPBELL, I THINK MAYBE HER NAME
CAN

[Captioner] 19:12:46
 BE, SOMETHING IN THOSE
TERMS, I'M SORRY IF I CAN'T
FULLY REMEMBER YOUR NAME

[Captioner] 19:12:49
 BUT I
HAD SOME VERY ENJOYABLE GOOD
EXPERIENCES WITH HER ON THE


[Captioner] 19:12:53
FREMONT UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT
BOARD.
IT'S NICE SHE'S ON

[Captioner] 19:12:57
 THE CURRENT
CITY COUNCIL.
IT WILL BE AN INTERESTING


[Captioner] 19:13:01
ADDITION, THANK YOU.
I'M INTERESTED HOW, OF COURSE,
HOW YOU CAN CONTINUE

[Captioner] 19:13:04
 TO ADDRESS
THE FUTURE OF THE NILES CANYON
AREA AND

[Captioner] 19:13:07
 TRAIN ISSUES.


[Captioner] 19:13:10
REALLY WELL.
I HOPE IT'S DONE REALLY WELL.
AND

[Captioner] 19:13:15
 IT'S DONE TO NOT POLLUTE THE
FUTURE OF THE AREA AND REALLY TO


[Captioner] 19:13:19
BE SENSITIVE FOR THE FUTURE OF
THE AREA.
GOOD LUCK WITH SUCH AN

[Captioner] 19:13:23
 ISSUE, IN
THE

[Captioner] 19:13:26
 NEXT FOUR YEARS IN FREMONT.
I WANTED TO QUICKLY

[Captioner] 19:13:30
 OFFER THAT
2023 HAS BEEN KIND OF PLANNED AS


[Captioner] 19:13:33
KIND OF A GRIM YEAR FOR
OURSELVES.
A

[Captioner] 19:13:37
 TOUGH YEAR.
GOOD LUCK HOW WE CAN WORK ON IT.
AND

[Captioner] 19:13:41
 I THINK I'VE BEEN TRYING TO
SAY THIS A FEW PLACES, THAT IF
WE JUST TRY

[Captioner] 19:13:45
 TO PRACTICE KIND OF
OUR GOOD SELVES AND WHAT IS OUR


[Captioner] 19:13:49
BETTER SELVES, WHAT WE WANT TO
REALLY BE DOING

[Captioner] 19:13:52
 FOR OUR BETTER
HUMAN IDEALS AND OUR FUTURE


[Captioner] 19:13:55
SUSTAINABILITY.
IF WE DO ALL THIS GOOD STUFF IN
THE GRIM YEAR

[Captioner] 19:14:00
 OF 2023, YOU KNOW,
THERE'S A REAL GOOD 2024

[Captioner] 19:14:04
 AND 25
THAT WE HAVE REALLY PLANNED FOR,
AND

[Captioner] 19:14:07
 ARE HOPING FOR, THAT IT CAN
JUST GET US

[Captioner] 19:14:10
 THERE.
IF WE DO GOOD WORK IN '23.
AND

[Captioner] 19:14:13
 SO JUST A GOOD LUCK TO
YOURSELVES IN THAT GOOD WORK

[Captioner] 19:14:16
 AND
YOUR GOOD IDEALS AND GOOD
PRACTICES, AND

[Captioner] 19:14:19
 THAT CAN BRING US
TO THE YEARS OF 2024 AND 25 THAT


[Captioner] 19:14:23
I THINK WE'RE ALL VERY HOPEFUL
FOR AND INTERESTED

[Captioner] 19:14:26
 IN, HOW THAT
CAN REALLY BE THE BEGINNING OF
OUR GOOD FUTURE.


[Captioner] 19:14:29
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:14:34
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
ARE THERE ANY OTHER SPEAKERS?


[Captioner] 19:14:38
SEEING NONE, I'M GOING TO CLOSE
THE PUBLIC

[Captioner] 19:14:41
 COMMUNICATIONS, AND
AT THIS TIME, I'LL RETURN

[Captioner] 19:14:44
 TO THE
CONSENT ITEMS THAT WERE PULLED
FROM THE CALENDAR.


[Captioner] 19:14:48
AND WE'LL BEGIN WITH

[Captioner] 19:14:52
 ITEM B1.
AND I

[Captioner] 19:14:54
 THINK THAT WAS
COUNCILMEMBER COX.
>> Councilmember Cox: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:15:00
IN THE MEETING MINUTES, DECEMBER 13TH, IT

[Captioner] 19:15:01
 TALKS ABOUT
ITEMS REFERRED BY
COUNCILMEMBERS.


[Captioner] 19:15:09
7A1.
THE REFERRAL THAT WAS PRESENTED
BY

[Captioner] 19:15:13
 MAYOR MEI REFERRAL IN THE
THIRD

[Captioner] 19:15:17
 PARAGRAPH DOWN, I WOULD
LIKE TO ADD

[Captioner] 19:15:20
 SOME CLARIFICATION
TO THIS REFERRAL.
IS

[Captioner] 19:15:24
 THAT MY SUGGESTED WORDING IS
THIS.
THE ORIGINAL

[Captioner] 19:15:27
 REFERRAL WAS
MODIFIED AND REPLACED IN ITS


[Captioner] 19:15:30
ENTIRETY FOR BROWN ACT TRAINING.
FOR COUNCIL

[Captioner] 19:15:33
 MEMBERS.


[Captioner] 19:15:41
AND WANTED TO FIND OUT IF THAT
WOULD BE ACCEPTABLE, CITY


[Captioner] 19:15:44
MANAGER AND CITY ATTORNEY, TO
REFLECT THAT.


[Captioner] 19:15:54
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: SO YOU
WOULD LIKE TO ADD LANGUAGE THAT


[Captioner] 19:15:57
SAYS -- AT THE PORTION FOLLOWING
THE VOTE, YOU WOULD LIKE TO

[Captioner] 19:15:59
 ADD
LANGUAGE, IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE
PROPOSING?


[Captioner] 19:16:02
>> Councilmember Cox: YEAH,
WELL, WHAT WAS SUBMITTED
ORIGINALLY WAS NOT WHAT WE

[Captioner] 19:16:05
 VOTED
ON.
IT WAS JUST VOTED ON WHAT IT

[Captioner] 19:16:09
 WAS
SUBMITTED AS, THE SUBMITTED
REFERRAL WAS MODIFIED

[Captioner] 19:16:12
 AND
REPLACED IN ITS ENTIRETY.
FOR BROWN

[Captioner] 19:16:15
 ACT TRAINING.
BY CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS.


[Captioner] 19:16:18
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: UNDER
7A1,

[Captioner] 19:16:21
 THE THIRD PARAGRAPH DOWN
SAYS, "ON MOTION BY


[Captioner] 19:16:25
COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL, SECONDED
BY COUNCILMEMBER SHAO, THE CITY
COUNCIL

[Captioner] 19:16:28
 APPROVED THE BROWN ACT
TRAINING FOR COUNCIL MEMBERS."


[Captioner] 19:16:32
SO THAT REFLECTS THE ENTIRETY OF
THE ACTION.
>> Councilmember Cox: 

[Captioner] 19:16:35
YEAH, BUT
IT DOESN'T SHOW THAT THE
ORIGINAL ONE THAT WAS

[Captioner] 19:16:38
 SUBMITTED
AND THEN HERE'S WHAT HAD

[Captioner] 19:16:41
 CHANGED
ON THAT ASPECT OF IT, BECAUSE IT
WAS NOT WHAT WE

[Captioner] 19:16:44
 VOTED
ORIGINALLY, AND WAS SUBMITTED.
SO I

[Captioner] 19:16:47
 JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE

[Captioner] 19:16:50
 THAT
THAT REFERRAL WAS CHANGED.
IN THE MOMENT OF THE

[Captioner] 19:16:54
 VOTING THAT
HAD OCCURRED THERE.
IT JUST -- TO ME,

[Captioner] 19:16:57
 IT DOESN'T
REPRESENT WHAT WAS

[Captioner] 19:17:00
 ORIGINAL AND
WHAT TRANSPIRED.
DURING OUR MEETING.


[Captioner] 19:17:04
>> Mayor Mei: THE REFERRAL WAS
AS AGENDIZED, I

[Captioner] 19:17:07
 BELIEVE.
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: THE


[Captioner] 19:17:09
REFERRAL IS WHAT WAS IN THE
STAFF REPORT.
THAT DIDN'T CHANGE.


[Captioner] 19:17:13
THE REFERRAL REMAINS THE SAME.
THE COUNCIL

[Captioner] 19:17:16
 DID NOT ACCEPT THE
REFERRAL AS

[Captioner] 19:17:19
 INCLUDED IN THE
STAFF REPORT.
IT MODIFIED WHAT

[Captioner] 19:17:23
 THE DIRECTION
TO CITY STAFF WOULD BE, AND

[Captioner] 19:17:26
 THIS
REFLECTS THAT

[Captioner] 19:17:29
 MODIFICATION.
THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN DO TO
RESCIND OR CHANGE THE REFERRAL


[Captioner] 19:17:32
BECAUSE THE REFERRAL IS --
>> Councilmember Cox: NO, I


[Captioner] 19:17:35
UNDERSTAND THAT BUT THE ACTION
WAS CHANGED AND YOU JUST

[Captioner] 19:17:38
 NOTED
THAT IN WHAT YOU JUST MENTIONED,
THAT IT WAS CHANGED TO THIS.


[Captioner] 19:17:41
AND I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE
THAT THAT WAS REFLECTED.


[Captioner] 19:17:48
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: UM, DO
YOU

[Captioner] 19:17:51
 WANT -- IT IS ACCURATE,
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY ACCURATE THAT
THE

[Captioner] 19:17:54
 ACTION TAKEN BY THE COUNCIL
IS DIFFERENT THAN WHAT

[Captioner] 19:17:57
 WAS IN
THE REFERRAL, AND THE MEETING
MINUTES DO REFLECT

[Captioner] 19:18:01
 THAT.
THEY SAY THAT THE

[Captioner] 19:18:04
 MOTION -- IT
ACCURATELY CAPTURES THE MOTION
BY COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL AND


[Captioner] 19:18:07
THE VOTE OF THE CITY COUNCIL.
>> Councilmember Cox: 

[Captioner] 19:18:10
YEAH, BUT
IT WASIT WAS

[Captioner] 19:18:13
 THE ACTION THAT WAS
CHANGED TO REFLECT THE VOTING.
THAT'S THE PART THAT I WANTED TO


[Captioner] 19:18:16
MAKE SURE WAS CAPTURED.


[Captioner] 19:18:21
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: IN THE
FORM OF ADDITIONAL LANGUAGE?
>> Councilmember Cox: YES.


[Captioner] 19:18:36
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: THE
PROCEDURAL STEP THAT WE WOULD
HAVE TO CHANGE TO MODIFY THIS IS


[Captioner] 19:18:39
THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO GET
COUNCIL CONSENSUS TO CHANGE THE
MEETING MINUTES OF

[Captioner] 19:18:44
 THE BODY TO
REFLECT THE ADDITIONAL LANGUAGE.


[Captioner] 19:18:47
SO MAYBE IT WOULD BE HELPFUL
THIS YOU PROPOSED IT AGAIN AND


[Captioner] 19:18:50
PUT IT UP FOR CONSIDERATION BY
YOUR FELLOW COUNCIL MEMBERS.


[Captioner] 19:18:53
>> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.
SO THE ORIGINAL REFERRAL WAS


[Captioner] 19:18:58
MODIFIED AND REPLACED IN ITS
ENTIRETY FOR THE BROWN ACT


[Captioner] 19:19:01
TRAINING, AND ON A MOTION BY
COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL,

[Captioner] 19:19:04
 SECONDED
BY COUNCILMEMBER SHAO, THE CITY
COUNCIL APPROVED

[Captioner] 19:19:07
 THE BROWN ACT
TRAINING FOR COUNCIL MEMBERS.


[Captioner] 19:19:11
>> Vice Mayor Keng: I WOULD
SECOND THAT.


[Captioner] 19:19:15
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY.
MOTION AND SECONDED.
DO WE HAVE TO DO A ROLL

[Captioner] 19:19:18
 CALL?
I THINK THAT

[Captioner] 19:19:21
 PERSONALLY IT DOES
REFLECT IT ALREADY IN THE
MINUTES,

[Captioner] 19:19:24
 BUT -- MOTION AND
SECONDED.
ROLL CALL

[Captioner] 19:19:26
 PLEASE.
>> Councilmember Campbell: WE
CAN HAVE A BRIEF DISCUSSION IF


[Captioner] 19:19:30
WE -- IF THERE'S ANY DISCUSSION?
>> Mayor Mei: SURE.
>> Councilmember Campbell: 

[Captioner] 19:19:33
I'D
LIKE TO UNDERSTAND THE
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

[Captioner] 19:19:36
 A REFERRAL
AND A RECOMMENDATION.


[Captioner] 19:19:40
SO IF THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION


[Captioner] 19:19:43
IS TO PROVIDE BROWN ACT


[Captioner] 19:19:46
TRAINING --
>> Mayor Mei: MY APOLOGIES.
SOMEBODY'S

[Captioner] 19:19:49
 ZOOM IS UNMUTED
BECAUSE I CAN HEAR OTHER
BACKGROUND NOISE.


[Captioner] 19:19:53
APOLOGIES, COUNCILMEMBER
CAMPBELL.
>> Councilmember Campbell: OKAY.


[Captioner] 19:19:57
SO IS A REFERRAL AND A
RECOMMENDATION THE SAME?


[Captioner] 19:20:01
SO THAT IF THE STAFF MADE A


[Captioner] 19:20:04
REFERRAL THAT HAS DIFFERENT
LANGUAGE IN IT SUCH AS THE


[Captioner] 19:20:08
CONFIDENTIALITY PIECE, BUT THE
RECOMMENDATION OF

[Captioner] 19:20:11
 THAT REFERRAL,
WHAT COMES OUT OF THAT IS THAT
WE HAVE BROWN

[Captioner] 19:20:14
 ACT TRAINING, IS
THAT WHAT WE

[Captioner] 19:20:17
 MAKE OUR DECISIONS
ON, IS THE

[Captioner] 19:20:21
 LANGUAGE IN THE
REFERRAL OR THE LANGUAGE IN THE
STAFF RECOMMENDATION?


[Captioner] 19:20:26
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: MAYBE
IT WOULD BE HELPFUL IF I TAKE
ONE STEP BACK AND

[Captioner] 19:20:30
 EXPLAIN THE
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE GENERAL


[Captioner] 19:20:33
STAFF REPORTS THAT WE SEE AS
PART OF THE

[Captioner] 19:20:36
 PACKET AND THEN THE
REFERRAL SECTION.
UNDER

[Captioner] 19:20:39
 THE HANDBOOK, THE CITY
COUNCIL'S HANDBOOK,

[Captioner] 19:20:43
 INDIVIDUAL
COUNCIL MEMBERS ARE ALLOWED TO
REFER

[Captioner] 19:20:46
 ITEMS FOR CONSIDERATION BY
THE FULL COUNCIL,

[Captioner] 19:20:49
 AND THAT
DOCUMENT REFLECTS THAT
INDIVIDUAL

[Captioner] 19:20:52
 AUTHOR'S PERSPECTIVE,
INCLUDING THE REQUEST OR THE
RECOMMENDATION.


[Captioner] 19:20:57
SO WHAT WE HAD ON DECEMBER 13TH


[Captioner] 19:21:00
WAS A REFERRAL BY COUNCILMEMBER
MEI,

[Captioner] 19:21:03
 REQUESTING THAT THE BODY,
THE COUNCIL, DIRECT STAFF TO

[Captioner] 19:21:06
 DO
A PARTICULAR ACTION.


[Captioner] 19:21:10
SO IS IT A RECOMMENDATION?


[Captioner] 19:21:14
YES, IT'S A RECOMMENDATION FROM
AN INDIVIDUAL

[Captioner] 19:21:17
 COUNCILMEMBER,
HERE IT WAS MAYOR MEI,

[Captioner] 19:21:21
 ASKING
WHETHER THE COUNCIL WAS
INTERESTED IN DIRECTING STAFF

[Captioner] 19:21:24
 TO
PERFORM CERTAIN ACTIONS.
AND AT THE END OF THAT, THE


[Captioner] 19:21:27
CONCLUSION WAS, YES, AS TO BROWN
ACT TRAINING.


[Captioner] 19:21:31
THE REST OF THE PACKETS ARE


[Captioner] 19:21:34
TYPICALLY STAFF-GENERATED STAFF
REPORTS

[Captioner] 19:21:37
 THAT INCLUDE
RECOMMENDATIONS FROM STAFF TO
THE BODY.


[Captioner] 19:21:42
SO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

[Captioner] 19:21:45
 THE
TYPICAL ACTION AND THE REFERRAL
IS SIMPLY THAT

[Captioner] 19:21:48
 REFERRALS COME
FROM INDIVIDUAL COUNCIL MEMBERS.
>> Councilmember Campbell: 

[Captioner] 19:21:52
AND
THE ACTION THAT COMES FROM

[Captioner] 19:21:56
 THAT
REFERRAL CAN BE IN MANY FORMS.
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE

[Captioner] 19:22:00
 VERBATIM.
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: IT
COULD BE IN MANY FORMS AND IT


[Captioner] 19:22:03
CAN BE NO ACTION.
THE COUNCIL IS NOT REQUIRED TO


[Captioner] 19:22:06
TAKE AN ACTION ON THE REFERRAL,
THE COUNCIL MAJORITY COULD
SIMPLY SAY

[Captioner] 19:22:09
 FOR THAT PARTICULAR
ITEM, THERE'S NO CONSENSUS TO
MOVE IT FORWARD AND

[Captioner] 19:22:12
 THE ITEM
WOULD END THERE.
SO YES, THERE ARE A VARIETY OF


[Captioner] 19:22:16
OUTCOMES THAT COULD OCCUR AS A
RESULT OF A REFERRAL.
>> Councilmember Campbell: OKAY.


[Captioner] 19:22:20
SO PROCEDURALLY, AND LEGALLY,
WHAT WE

[Captioner] 19:22:24
 HAVE HERE REPRESENTS THE
WILL OF THE BOARD.
I

[Captioner] 19:22:27
 MEAN THE COUNCIL.
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: YES,
WHAT WE HAVE HERE IS THE

[Captioner] 19:22:30
 MEETING
MINUTES THAT REFLECT THE ACTION
THAT WAS TAKEN BY THE

[Captioner] 19:22:33
 COUNCIL ON
DECEMBER 13TH, WHICH

[Captioner] 19:22:37
 IS
DIFFERENT, AS COUNCILMEMBER COX
NOTED, IS DIFFERENT THAN

[Captioner] 19:22:39
 THE
ORIGINAL REFERRAL.
>> Councilmember Campbell: AND


[Captioner] 19:22:43
THAT'S OKAY.
THERE'S NOTHING OUT OF ORDER

[Captioner] 19:22:46
 FOR
THAT PROCEDURALLY?
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: CORRECT


[Captioner] 19:22:49
>> Councilmember Campbell: OKAY.
THANK YOU.
>> Ms. Gauthier: 

[Captioner] 19:22:51
COUNCILMEMBER
KASSAN HAS HER HAND RAISED ON
ZOOM.


[Captioner] 19:22:54
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY.
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN.
>> Ms. Gauthier: AND I SEE


[Captioner] 19:22:57
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN HAS HIS.
>> Mayor Mei: YES, I SAW

[Captioner] 19:22:59
 THAT
TOO.
THAT'S THE ONE I SAW.


[Captioner] 19:23:02
I COULDN'T

[Captioner] 19:23:06
 SEE KASSAN'S.
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN.
>> Councilmember Kassan: I CAN


[Captioner] 19:23:09
SEE COUNCILMEMBER COX'S POINT,
BECAUSE IF YOU

[Captioner] 19:23:14
 READ THE MINUTES,
IT IS A LITTLE BIT

[Captioner] 19:23:17
 UNCLEAR
BECAUSE IT STATES THE REFERRAL
AND THEN IT SHOWS

[Captioner] 19:23:20
 THE VOTE.
SO I CAN SEE HOW IT

[Captioner] 19:23:23
 WOULD BE
ARGUED THAT IT IS CORRECT, BUT I
THINK

[Captioner] 19:23:27
 IT COULD BE MORE CLEAR
BECAUSE IF YOU

[Captioner] 19:23:30
 READ IT QUICKLY,
IT COULD LOOK LIKE

[Captioner] 19:23:33
 THE VOTE --
THE YES VOTE WAS FOR THE


[Captioner] 19:23:38
ORIGINAL REEFERLT,

[Captioner] 19:23:41
 SO I WOULD BE
SUPPORTIVE OF PUTTING IN
CLARIFYING LANGUAGE.


[Captioner] 19:23:43
THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN.


[Captioner] 19:23:51
>> Councilmember Salwan: THANK
YOU, MADAME MAYOR.
I'M SORRY, COULD YOU REPEAT THE


[Captioner] 19:23:53
MOTION?
I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE I
UNDERSTAND EXACTLY WHAT'S BEING


[Captioner] 19:23:57
ASKED SO I CAN GIVE SOME
FEEDBACK.


[Captioner] 19:24:01
>> Councilmember Cox: SURE.
SO WHEN YOU READ THE MAYOR
REFERRAL, IT SAYS

[Captioner] 19:24:04
 DIRECT STAFF
TO ARRANGE FOR FORMAL REVIEW OF
CLOSED SESSION BROWN

[Captioner] 19:24:08
 ACT
CONFIDENTIALITY REQUIREMENTS AND
IDENTIFY POTENTIAL ACTIONS

[Captioner] 19:24:10
 TO
ADDRESS VIOLATIONS AND
MISCONDUCT.


[Captioner] 19:24:15
OKAY?
SO THE FIRST TWO SENTENCE,

[Captioner] 19:24:16
 I'M
OKAY WITH.
IT'S THE LAST SENTENCE THAT I


[Captioner] 19:24:20
THINK WE NEEDED TO ADD MORE
CLARIFICATION TO.


[Captioner] 19:24:24
AND THAT IS -- AND THIS PART IS
NOT

[Captioner] 19:24:27
 WRITTEN, OKAY?
SO I'M ADDING IN A SENTENCE
BEFORE THE

[Captioner] 19:24:31
 LAST SENTENCE, AND
IT'S GOING TO -- THIS IS MY
SUGGESTED

[Captioner] 19:24:34
 WORDING.
IT IS:  THE ORIGINAL REFERRAL


[Captioner] 19:24:37
WAS MODIFIED AND REPLACED IN ITS
ENTIRETY FOR BROWN

[Captioner] 19:24:40
 ACT TRAINING.
ON

[Captioner] 19:24:43
 A MOTION BY COUNCILMEMBER
CAMPBELL, SECONDED

[Captioner] 19:24:46
 BY
COUNCILMEMBER SHAO, THE CITY
COUNCIL APPROVED THE

[Captioner] 19:24:50
 BROWN ACT
TRAINING FOR COUNCIL

[Captioner] 19:24:53
 MEMBERS.
BECAUSE WHEN YOU READ THE
REFERRAL AND AS

[Captioner] 19:24:57
 WRITTEN, IT HAS
ONE THING, AND THEN IT TURNED
AROUND TO JUST

[Captioner] 19:25:00
 BE A BROWN
TRAINING, AND WHEN

[Captioner] 19:25:03
 YOU'RE
DOCUMENTING MEETING MINUTES,
IT'S IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THAT


[Captioner] 19:25:06
WE CAPTURE AND ADD CLARITY THAT
THE

[Captioner] 19:25:09
 ORIGINAL WAS NOT ACCEPTED AS
IS, AND JUST

[Captioner] 19:25:13
 MAKING SURE THAT
THE ACTION WAS DIRECTED, WE DID
VOTE ON

[Captioner] 19:25:16
 IT, YES, WE DID AGREE ON
BROWN ACT TRAINING,

[Captioner] 19:25:20
 BUT JUST
MAKING SURE THAT THE ORIGINAL
ACTION THAT WAS

[Captioner] 19:25:23
 WRITTEN AS THE
REFERRAL AND THE SUBTITLE
DOESN'T

[Captioner] 19:25:26
 CONFUSE PEOPLE WITH THAT
VERSUS WHAT WAS THE LAST MOTION
THAT WAS

[Captioner] 19:25:29
 TAKEN.


[Captioner] 19:25:33
>> Councilmember Salwan: OKAY.


[Captioner] 19:25:36
SO MR. RAFAEL,

[Captioner] 19:25:39
 DOES THE CURRENT
MINUTES CAPTURE THAT SENTIMENT?


[Captioner] 19:25:43
WHAT THE ACTION WAS TAKEN?
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: THE
MEETING

[Captioner] 19:25:46
 MINUTES DO REFLECT THE
ACTION OF

[Captioner] 19:25:49
 THE BODY.
WHAT COUNCILMEMBER COX IS ASKING
IS FOR

[Captioner] 19:25:52
 THIS BODY TO ADD THE
ADDITIONAL SENTENCE THAT

[Captioner] 19:25:56

CLARIFIES THAT THE ORIGINAL
RECOMMENDATION IN

[Captioner] 19:25:59
 THE REFERRAL
WAS ULTIMATELY DIFFERENT THAN
THE COUNCIL

[Captioner] 19:26:03
 ACTION, AND IF I
MAY, COUNCILMEMBER COX, I'M
GOING TO OFFER

[Captioner] 19:26:07
 A SLIGHT CHANGE
TO WHAT LANGUAGE YOU'RE

[Captioner] 19:26:13

PROFFERING BECAUSE THE LANGUAGE
THAT YOU

[Captioner] 19:26:16
 PROFER WAS THAT YOU ADD
LANGUAGE THAT SAYS SOMETHING
ALONG THE LINES THAT THE


[Captioner] 19:26:19
ORIGINAL REFERRAL WAS MODIFIED
AND REPLACED IN ITS

[Captioner] 19:26:23
 ENTIRETY, IS
NOT TECHNICALLY ACCURATE BECAUSE
THE REFERRAL REMAINS

[Captioner] 19:26:26
 AS PART OF
THAT PACKET IN ITS FORM.


[Captioner] 19:26:29
THAT DOESN'T CHANGE.
WE'RE NOT MODIFYING THAT.
BUT I THINK THE HEART

[Captioner] 19:26:32
 OF WHAT
YOU'RE TRYING TO SAY, AND
CORRECT ME IF

[Captioner] 19:26:34
 I'M WRONG --
>> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado:  -- IS


[Captioner] 19:26:37
THAT THE RECOMMENDATION IN THE
REFERRAL WAS MODIFIED BY THE
BODY.


[Captioner] 19:26:40
>> Councilmember Cox: YES.
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: AND
WHAT THE COUNCIL

[Captioner] 19:26:44
 CAN DO IF THE
MAJORITY DECIDES IT'S
APPROPRIATE IS TO ADD

[Captioner] 19:26:47
 THAT
LANGUAGE THAT SAYS, YOU KNOW,
THE RECOMMENDATION IN THE


[Captioner] 19:26:50
REFERRAL WAS MODIFIED AS
FOLLOWS, AND THEN WE

[Captioner] 19:26:53
 CAN LEAVE
THE EXISTING LANGUAGE ABOUT THE
MOTION ITSELF.


[Captioner] 19:26:58
SO IT WOULD READ, IF I MAY, I'LL
KIND OF READ OUT WHAT

[Captioner] 19:27:01
 THE WHOLE
PARAGRAPH WOULD SAY, AND I'M
REFERRING TO

[Captioner] 19:27:05
 THE THIRD PARAGRAPH
UNDER 7A1 IN THE MINUTES.


[Captioner] 19:27:09
THE LANGUAGE WOULD SAY, QUOTE,
THE RECOMMENDATION IN

[Captioner] 19:27:12
 THE
REFERRAL WAS MODIFIED AS

[Captioner] 19:27:15

FOLLOWS.
SEMICOLON.


[Captioner] 19:27:18
ON MOTION BY COUNCILMEMBER
CAMPBELL, SECONDED BY
COUNCILMEMBER

[Captioner] 19:27:23
 SHAO, THE CITY
COUNCIL APPROVED THE BROWN ACT
TRAINING FOR COUNCIL

[Captioner] 19:27:25
 MEMBERS.
>> Councilmember Cox: THAT'S
PERFECT.


[Captioner] 19:27:29
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:27:32
>> Mayor Mei: COUNCILMEMBER
SALWAN, ANYTHING ELSE?
>> Councilmember Salwan: THAT,


[Captioner] 19:27:35
I'M OKAY WITH.
I WAS JUST CONCERNED ABOUT


[Captioner] 19:27:38
PRECEDENT AND PROTOCOL, JUST
MAKING SURE

[Captioner] 19:27:42
 WE CAN STAY
CONSISTENT, BECAUSE MANY

[Captioner] 19:27:45
 TIMES,
FOR EXAMPLE, WE HAVE STAFF
RECOMMENDATION, WE

[Captioner] 19:27:47
 DON'T ACCEPT
STAFF RECOMMENDATION BUT WE
DON'T GO OUT OF OUR WAY TO SAY


[Captioner] 19:27:52
THAT WE DON'T AGREE.
AND

[Captioner] 19:27:55
 ALSO IN THE PAST, I MEAN,
CITY CLERK CAN MAYBE COMMENT
MORE ABOUT THAT, LIKE

[Captioner] 19:27:58
 WHAT THE
PROTOCOL OR PROCEDURE HAS BEEN.
I DON'T WANT TO GO OUT OF OUR


[Captioner] 19:28:01
WAY TO MODIFY WHAT'S BEEN
WORKING FOR A LONG TIME.
I

[Captioner] 19:28:04
 UNDERSTAND THE INTENT, BUT I
JUST WANT TO TRY TO GET A


[Captioner] 19:28:08
CLARITY, LIKE HOW WE HAVE BEEN
DOING IT IN THE

[Captioner] 19:28:11
 PAST.
BECAUSE MOST OF THE TIME, THE
REFERRAL COMES, WE DON'T

[Captioner] 19:28:14
 ACCEPT
THE ENTIRETY, WE MAKE SOME


[Captioner] 19:28:17
MODIFICATIONS.
>> Ms. Gauthier: SOMETIMES
THERE'S NO VOTE.


[Captioner] 19:28:20
IT DEPENDS.
>> Councilmember Cox: IT
DEPENDS.


[Captioner] 19:28:23
>> Mayor Mei: SO COUNCILMEMBER
SHAO, DID YOU HAVE YOUR
QUESTIONS ANSWERED?


[Captioner] 19:28:27
>> Councilmember Shao: ACTUALLY,
I JUST WANT TO HAVE THE

[Captioner] 19:28:28
 SAME --
EXPRESS MY OPINION THAT I HAVE


[Captioner] 19:28:31
THE SAME CONCERN ABOUT THE
PROTOCOL AND

[Captioner] 19:28:35
 PRECEDENT, AND I
VIVIDLY REMEMBER THAT DURING
LAST MEETING,

[Captioner] 19:28:38
 CERTAIN
COUNCILMEMBER INSIST THE MEETING
MINUTES BE

[Captioner] 19:28:42
 WRITTEN IN A CERTAIN
WAY, WHICH CERTAINLY

[Captioner] 19:28:47
 IS NOT HOW
THE --

[Captioner] 19:28:50
 THE COMMON PRACTICE IS,
AND NOW WE

[Captioner] 19:28:53
 TRY TO REALLY SPLIT
THE HAIR AND THEN

[Captioner] 19:28:57
 TRY TO MAKE, I
WOULD SAY,

[Captioner] 19:29:00
 A BIG EXCLAMATION
MARK ON THE

[Captioner] 19:29:04
 MEETING MINUTES, I
DON'T THINK IS

[Captioner] 19:29:07
 NECESSARY, AND AS
LONG AS TO THE BEST OF

[Captioner] 19:29:11
 MY
RECOLLECTION, I SECONDED THE
MOTION AND THAT

[Captioner] 19:29:14
 MOTION WAS
CORRECTLY RECORDED, AND

[Captioner] 19:29:17
 THE
VOTING WAS CORRECTLY RECORDED,
IT IS

[Captioner] 19:29:21
 A FAITHFUL AND CORRECT
RECORDING OF

[Captioner] 19:29:23
 THE TRUTH, THE
WHOLE TRUTH AND NOTHING BUT THE
TRUTH.


[Captioner] 19:29:27
SO WITH

[Captioner] 19:29:31
 THAT, I AM VERY GLAD
THAT

[Captioner] 19:29:34
 OUR CITY ATTORNEY PROPOSED
THE

[Captioner] 19:29:38
 LANGUAGE, AND I ACCEPT THAT
LANGUAGE, BUT MY CONCERNS REMAIN


[Captioner] 19:29:41
THE SAME IN TERMS OF THE


[Captioner] 19:29:45
PROTOCOL AND PRECEDENT.


[Captioner] 19:29:48
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
COUNCILMEMBER KENG.


[Captioner] 19:29:53
>> Vice Mayor Keng: THANK YOU,
MAYOR.
SO I DO WANT

[Captioner] 19:29:56
 TO SHARE WHAT
COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL THAT

[Captioner] 19:30:00

YOUR -- I

[Captioner] 19:30:05
 THINK YOUR GOAL --
WE'RE NOT TRYING TO CHANGE HOW
IT WAS

[Captioner] 19:30:09
 WORDED, BUT BECAUSE IT
WAS DIFFERENT FROM THE

[Captioner] 19:30:12
 WHOLE
REFERRAL, WE ARE JUST -- WE ONLY
VOTED ON

[Captioner] 19:30:15
 HAVING A BROWN ACT
TRAINING, SO IF WE -- I

[Captioner] 19:30:18
 THINK I
DO SUPPORT

[Captioner] 19:30:21
 WHAT CITY ATTORNEY
ALVARADO SAID EARLIER ABOUT


[Captioner] 19:30:25
CLARIFYING, I THINK THAT WOULD


[Captioner] 19:30:28
NOT, YOU KNOW, CONFUSE PEOPLE
THAT WE

[Captioner] 19:30:31
 ARE -- WE VOTED ON THE
ENTIRE REFERRAL,

[Captioner] 19:30:34
 BUT WE ONLY
VOTED ON THE BROWN ACT TRAINING
PART.


[Captioner] 19:30:40
>> Mayor Mei: I HAVE A
CLARIFICATION QUESTION THAT I'D
ASKED AT THE

[Captioner] 19:30:43
 END.
AS PART OF BROWN ACT TRAINING,
THE REASON WHY WE DO BROWN ACT


[Captioner] 19:30:46
TRAINING IS TO ALSO ADDRESS
WHAT -- I

[Captioner] 19:30:50
 MEAN, PART OF WHY A
CITY DOES A BROWN ACT TRAINING
IS TO ADDRESS

[Captioner] 19:30:53
 THE POTENTIAL FOR
VIOLATIONS AND MISCONDUCT, AND
AS

[Captioner] 19:30:56
 SUCH ALSO, IN THE TRAINING,
IN THE PAST WHEN I'VE

[Captioner] 19:30:59
 TAKEN IT,
ADDRESSED WHAT ACTIONS ARE
TAKEN.


[Captioner] 19:31:02
SO IT'S NOT ENTIRELY INCORRECT
TO SAY THAT YOU WILL BE


[Captioner] 19:31:06
ADDRESSING ACTIONS.
BUT I THINK THAT THAT'S WHY THE
RECORD

[Captioner] 19:31:09
 AS IT STANDS, I WOULD
SUPPORT IT AS IT STANDS.


[Captioner] 19:31:13
AND I'D LIKE TO MAKE A
SUBSTITUTE MOTION

[Captioner] 19:31:16
 THEN.
SO I'D LIKE TO TAKE THE
SUBSTITUTE

[Captioner] 19:31:19
 TO ADDRESS THE MOTION
TO MAKE IT

[Captioner] 19:31:22
 AS IT STANDS, THE
MINUTES REFLECTED AS IT STANDS.


[Captioner] 19:31:29
>> Councilmember Shao: I SECOND.
>> Vice Mayor Keng: I HAVE


[Captioner] 19:31:32
ANOTHER COMMENT, PLEASE?
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY.
>> Vice Mayor Keng: SO I THINK


[Captioner] 19:31:35
IT IS IMPORTANT TO ADD THAT
CLARIFICATION BECAUSE, MAYOR,
YOUR REFERRAL WAS

[Captioner] 19:31:38
 NOT ENTIRELY
CORRECT, BECAUSE ACCORDING TO


[Captioner] 19:31:45
CITY MANAGER SHACKELFORD AND
CITY ATTORNEY ALVARADO DURING
THE LAST

[Captioner] 19:31:48
 MEETING, THERE WAS NO
APPROVED CENSURE IN

[Captioner] 19:31:51
 THE PAST AS
STATED IN THE REFERRAL.
SO IF WE

[Captioner] 19:31:54
 DON'T MAKE THAT
CLARIFICATION, THAT WOULD

[Captioner] 19:31:57
 BE,
YOU KNOW, DOWN THE LINE PEOPLE
DON'T REMEMBER AND THEY DON'T GO


[Captioner] 19:32:01
BACK TO SEE THE TAPING, IT WOULD


[Captioner] 19:32:04
BE VERY MISLEADING.
>> Mayor Mei: I THINK THAT THE
MINUTES REFLECT

[Captioner] 19:32:07
 THE ACTION THAT
WAS TAKEN IN THE MOTION AND

[Captioner] 19:32:10
 THE
SECOND AS REFLECTED BY
COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL AND


[Captioner] 19:32:14
SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER SHAO.
AND THE VOTE

[Captioner] 19:32:16
 SPECIFICALLY
CLARIFIED THAT IT WAS FOR THE
BROWN ACT TRAINING.


[Captioner] 19:32:20
AND SO THAT AS IT STANDS, IT IS
REFLECTED CORRECTLY IN THE
MINUTES.


[Captioner] 19:32:24
AND SINCE THERE IS A SUBSTITUTE
MOTION, THERE IS A MOTION AND

[Captioner] 19:32:26
 A
SECOND, I'D LIKE TO CALL THE
VOTE.


[Captioner] 19:32:31
>> Ms. Gauthier: WE HAVE A
PUBLIC SPEAKER.
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY.


[Captioner] 19:32:34
>> Ms. Gauthier: WE'LL GIVE THE
PUBLIC SPEAKER ONE MINUTE FOR
THE CONSENT

[Captioner] 19:32:37
 ITEM.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:32:41
WELCOME.
>> HI.
BLAIR BEEKMAN HERE.


[Captioner] 19:32:45
I WAS -- ACTUALLY MY HAND WAS
RAISED FOR THE NEXT CONSENT


[Captioner] 19:32:49
CALENDAR ITEM, BUT JUST A THANK
YOU.
I

[Captioner] 19:32:52
 THOUGHT THIS WAS A VERY
INTERESTING ITEM THAT

[Captioner] 19:32:56
 WOULD
BE -- IT WILL BE NICE TO REVIEW
THIS ITEM AND JUST

[Captioner] 19:32:58
 REALLY
UNDERSTAND GOOD BROWN ACT
PRACTICES AND GOOD PROCEDURAL


[Captioner] 19:33:01
PRACTICES OF FREMONT CITY
COUNCIL.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:33:05
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:33:11
COUNCILMEMBER COX -- CAMPBELL.
>> Councilmember Campbell: THE

[Captioner] 19:33:13

Cs CONFUSE, I KNOW THAT.
I JUST WANT TO DO ANOTHER POINT


[Captioner] 19:33:16
OF ORDER.
IF ANYONE IS INTENDED TO

[Captioner] 19:33:19
 ABSTAIN
OR IF THEY VOTE NAY ON

[Captioner] 19:33:23
 THIS
ITEM, ACCORDINGLY, THEY NEED TO
SAY SO BEFORE THE

[Captioner] 19:33:26
 VOTE, NOT
AFTERWARDS, AND THEN AFTER WE


[Captioner] 19:33:29
VOTE, WE HAVE TO MOVE ON.
WE CAN'T DISCUSS THIS

[Captioner] 19:33:31
 ANY
FURTHER.
>> Mayor Mei: YES.


[Captioner] 19:33:32
>> Councilmember Campbell: OKAY,
THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:33:39
SO I THINK WE HAVE TO DO A ROLL
CALL FOR THIS ONE.


[Captioner] 19:33:42
>> Ms. Gauthier: SO WE'RE DOING
THE ROLL CALL VOTE FOR THE
SUBSTITUTE MOTION, CORRECT?


[Captioner] 19:33:46
>> Mayor Mei: YES, CORRECT.
>> Ms. Gauthier: COUNCILMEMBER
COX,

[Captioner] 19:33:51
 NO.
COUNCILMEMBER

[Captioner] 19:33:54
 SALWAN, AYE, AND I
JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT I
BELIEVE THIS

[Captioner] 19:33:57
 IS ACCURATELY
REFLECTED.
I WAS OKAY

[Captioner] 19:34:01
 WITH THE OTHER CITY


[Captioner] 19:34:04
ATTORNEY'S SUGGESTION BUT I AM
CONCERNED ABOUT PROTOCOL AND


[Captioner] 19:34:07
PRECEDENT AND WANT TO BE
CONSISTENT WITH PAST PRACTICE,
SO

[Captioner] 19:34:10
 AYE FOR ME.
>> Ms. Gauthier: COUNCILMEMBER
SHAO,

[Captioner] 19:34:14
 AYE.
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN,

[Captioner] 19:34:20
 NO.


[Captioner] 19:34:23

DECEMBER 6TH MEETING

[Captioner] 19:34:51

WE ALSO NEED TO VOTE ON THE
DECEMBER 6TH 1 AND I

[Captioner] 19:34:57
 KNOW THAT
COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL IS GOING
TO ABSTAIN FROM

[Captioner] 19:35:04
 THAT ONE.
I SEE COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN WOULD
LIKE TO

>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
AND COULD WE HAVE A ROLL

[Captioner] 19:35:14

MR. BEEKMAN?


[Captioner] 19:36:32
>> HI, BLAIR BEEKMAN HERE.
I HOPE IT HAS BEEN NOTICED IN


[Captioner] 19:36:35
THE PAST YEAR HOW MUCH LOCAL BAY
AREA

[Captioner] 19:36:38
 GOVERNMENTS AND LAW
ENFORCEMENT

[Captioner] 19:36:42
 ACROSS CALIFORNIA --
THAT WE'VE BEEN HAVING A VERY
DIFFICULT TIME TRYING

[Captioner] 19:36:45
 TO OPENLY
DESCRIBE TO THE EVERYDAY PUBLIC
MORE

[Captioner] 19:36:48
 EXACT NUMBERS OF THE NEW


[Captioner] 19:36:52
AOPR TECHNOLOGY AND SURVEILLANCE
EQUIPMENT CURRENTLY BEING

[Captioner] 19:36:54
 FUNDED
IN NEW FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
PROGRAMS TO FIGHT LOCAL CRIME


[Captioner] 19:36:58
ISSUES IN THE PAST FEW YEARS.
I ONLY GOT

[Captioner] 19:37:00
 A MINUTE TO SPEAK,
HUH?
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.


[Captioner] 19:37:05
THIS COUNTRY HAS ALSO BASICALLY
BEEN AT WAR WITH UKRAINE.
I THINK

[Captioner] 19:37:08
 IT'S TIME TO WANT TO
MAKE ADDITIONAL EFFORTS TO BE
OPEN AND ACCOUNTABLE TO THE


[Captioner] 19:37:11
PUBLIC AND WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT
TECHNOLOGY AND DATA COLLECTION


[Captioner] 19:37:14
PRACTICES OF A

[Captioner] 19:37:18
 COMMUNITY.
YOU KNOW, WITH ALL THIS NEW
DRONE

[Captioner] 19:37:22
 EQUIPMENT AND MILITARY
HARDWARE, I JUST HOPE WE'RE
CONSIDERING

[Captioner] 19:37:25
 THE PRACTICES OF
OPEN PUBLIC POLICIES INSTEAD OF


[Captioner] 19:37:29
WAR, AND GOOD LUCK HOW WE CAN
ADDRESS THOSE SORT OF THINGS.
IT'S

[Captioner] 19:37:32
 IMPORTANT FOR OUR FUTURE.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:37:39
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
WAS THERE A COUNCIL SPEAKER ON
THIS?


[Captioner] 19:37:43
OKAY.
COUNCILMEMBER SHAO.
>> Councilmember Shao: THANK


[Captioner] 19:37:48

I'M READY TO MAKE A

[Captioner] 19:37:51
 MOTION FOR
THIS ITEM.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK

[Captioner] 19:37:55

>> Councilmember Cox: SECOND.
>> Mayor Mei: 

[Captioner] 19:37:57
MOTION BY
COUNCILMEMBER SHAO AND SECONDED
BY COUNCILMEMBER COX.


[Captioner] 19:38:00
COULD WE GET A ROLL CALL VOTE,
PLEASE?
>> Ms. Gauthier: COUNCILMEMBER


[Captioner] 19:38:03
COX, AYE.
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN, AYE.
COUNCILMEMBER SHAO, AYE.


[Captioner] 19:38:07
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, AYE.

[Captioner] 19:38:14
 KENG, AYE.
MAYOR MEI, AYE.
>> Mayor Mei: SO THE MOTION


[Captioner] 19:38:17
PASSES FOR THIS ITEM.


[Captioner] 19:38:22
NEXT ON OUR AGENDA THIS EVENING
IS

[Captioner] 19:38:26
 A REFERRAL.
SORRY, IT'S

[Captioner] 19:38:30
 ITEM 5A.
THERE'S NO PRESENTATION, BUT OUR
HOUSING

[Captioner] 19:38:33
 MANAGER, LUCIA HUGHES,
WILL GIVE US A BRIEF OVERVIEW.


[Captioner] 19:38:38
WELCOME.
>> THANK YOU, MAYOR.
GOOD EVENING, MADAME MAYOR AND


[Captioner] 19:38:42
VICE MAYOR AND MEMBERS OF THE
CITY COUNCIL.
THE

[Captioner] 19:38:45
 ITEM BEFORE YOU FOR YOUR
CONSIDERATION TONIGHT IS

[Captioner] 19:38:48
 THE
PROPOSED AMENDMENTS THAT THE
CITY'S

[Captioner] 19:38:51
 AFFORDABLE HOUSING
ORDINANCE TO INTEGRATE LOCAL


[Captioner] 19:38:55
LIVE/WORK PREFERENCE POLICY
REQUIREMENTS.
SO

[Captioner] 19:38:58
 WHAT DOES LOCAL LIVE/WORK


[Captioner] 19:39:02
PREFERENCE POLICY EXACTLY MEAN
IN THIS CONTEXT?
IT MEANS THAT

[Captioner] 19:39:05
 PRIORITY
PLACEMENTS FOR AFFORDABLE
HOUSING BE

[Captioner] 19:39:08
 GIVEN TO THOSE LIVING
AND/OR WORKING

[Captioner] 19:39:11
 IN FREMONT TO THE
EXTENT ALLOWED BY FAIR HOUSING


[Captioner] 19:39:17
LAW.
THE PROPOSED POLICY IS TO
MITIGATE THE DISPLACEMENT


[Captioner] 19:39:20
IMPACTS THAT MAY RESULT FROM
DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES

[Captioner] 19:39:24
 AND
INCREASING JOB OPPORTUNITIES IN
THE CITY.


[Captioner] 19:39:27
IT IS DESIGNED TO INCREASE THE


[Captioner] 19:39:30
PROBABILITY THAT CURRENT
RESIDENTS MAY REMAIN IN

[Captioner] 19:39:34
 THE
COMMUNITY IN THE FACE OF
INCREASING

[Captioner] 19:39:37
 MARKET RATE RENTS AND
HOUSING

[Captioner] 19:39:41
 CRISIS.
IT IS ALSO DESIGNED TO MAXIMIZE
THE EFFECT

[Captioner] 19:39:44
 OF AN IMPROVED JOBS
TO

[Captioner] 19:39:47
 HOUSING RATIO BY INCREASING
LOCAL HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES

[Captioner] 19:39:51
 FOR
LOCAL EMPLOYEES.
I'D LIKE

[Captioner] 19:39:54
 TO POINT OUT THAT IT
HAS BEEN A LONG-STANDING
PRACTICE OF

[Captioner] 19:39:57
 THE CITY TO REQUIRE
THAT AFFORDABLE

[Captioner] 19:40:01
 HOUSING PROJECT
RECEIVING CITY FUNDING AND/OR


[Captioner] 19:40:04
DEVELOPED PURSUANT

[Captioner] 19:40:07
 TO THE
AFFORDABLE HOUSING ORDINANCE TO
PROVIDE A LOCAL PRIORITY


[Captioner] 19:40:10
PREFERENCE TO THOSE WHO LIVE OR
WORK IN

[Captioner] 19:40:15
 FREMONT.
THIS LOCAL PRACTICE IS BASED ON
CITY

[Captioner] 19:40:20
 COUNCIL DIRECTION TO ENSURE
THAT AFFORDABLE HOUSING

[Captioner] 19:40:23

DEVELOPMENTS SERVE THOSE LIVING
AND/OR WORKING IN FREMONT TO THE


[Captioner] 19:40:26
MAXIMUM EXTENT ALLOWED BY FAIR
HOUSING

[Captioner] 19:40:31
 LAW.


[Captioner] 19:40:35
INTEGRATING INTO THE ORDINANCE
WOULD STRENGTHEN THE
REQUIREMENTS AND TO

[Captioner] 19:40:40
 ENSURE THAT
IT IS TRANSPARENT TO ALL
STAKEHOLDERS.


[Captioner] 19:40:44
STAFF PRESENTED THE PROPOSED
AMENDMENTS TO THE PLANNING


[Captioner] 19:40:47
COMMISSION ON NOVEMBER 17TH.
THE

[Captioner] 19:40:51
 PLANNING COMMISSION VOTED
UNANIMOUSLY TO RECOMMEND

[Captioner] 19:40:54
 THAT
THE CITY COUNCIL ADOPT THE
PROPOSED

[Captioner] 19:40:57
 AMENDMENTS.
THIS CONCLUDES MY OVERVIEW, AND
I AM AVAILABLE TO

[Captioner] 19:40:58
 ANSWER
QUESTIONS.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:41:04
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
AT THIS TIME, I'D LIKE TO TURN
TO COUNCIL FOR

[Captioner] 19:41:07
 QUESTIONS.
I'M NOT SURE IF SOME OF THESE
ARE FROM BEFORE.


[Captioner] 19:41:10
COUNCILMEMBER SHAO, DO YOU HAVE
A QUESTION OR COMMENT ON THIS
ITEM?


[Captioner] 19:41:14
QUESTIONS RIGHT NOW, BUT --
>> Councilmember Shao: THANK
YOU, MADAME MAYOR.


[Captioner] 19:41:17
THAT WAS FROM THE PREVIOUS ITEM.
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:41:23
COUNCILMEMBER COX, IS YOURS FROM
THE PREVIOUS ITEM ALSO?


[Captioner] 19:41:42
>> Councilmember Cox: I THINK
IT'S A WONDERFUL IDEA

[Captioner] 19:41:47
 THAT WE
HELP INCREASE AFFORDABLE HOUSING
AND

[Captioner] 19:41:50
 ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE THAT
WORK AND LIVE IN

[Captioner] 19:41:53
 OUR WONDERFUL
CITY OF FREMONT, AND WE KNOW


[Captioner] 19:41:57
THAT AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS A


[Captioner] 19:42:00
CHALLENGE, AND ESPECIALLY FOR
THOSE

[Captioner] 19:42:04
 THAT ARE COMING BACK AND


[Captioner] 19:42:07
FORTH TO BE ABLE TO GET HERE
THROUGH

[Captioner] 19:42:14
 PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION.
I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT WILL
HELP INCREASE

[Captioner] 19:42:17
 JOB OPPORTUNITIES
THAT WILL HELP THOSE THAT WANT
TO

[Captioner] 19:42:20
 LIVE HERE IN FREMONT TO BE
ABLE TO BE CLOSE

[Captioner] 19:42:24
 BY.
I THINK THAT I APPRECIATE

[Captioner] 19:42:27
 THE


[Captioner] 19:42:31
WORK THAT MS. HUGHES AND HER
TEAM HAVE PUT FORTH

[Captioner] 19:42:34
 IN ADOPTING
AND MAKING THESE CHANGES TO

[Captioner] 19:42:38
 THE
FREMONT CODE ORDINANCES, AND I


[Captioner] 19:42:41
THINK THAT IT'S THE RIGHT THING
TO DO TO HELP

[Captioner] 19:42:44
 US IN THIS DIRE
NEED OF TRYING TO

[Captioner] 19:42:47
 FIND
AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR THOSE
THAT ARE NOT

[Captioner] 19:42:51
 ABLE TO, AND
ESPECIALLY HELPING THE MOST
VULNERABLE

[Captioner] 19:42:54
 AND UNDERREPRESENTED
COMMUNITIES TO BE ABLE

[Captioner] 19:42:57
 TO LIVE,
WORK AND PLAY HERE IN FREMONT.


[Captioner] 19:43:00
SO I WOULD BE IN SUPPORT OF
THIS.


[Captioner] 19:43:05
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
NEXT, I'D LIKE TO OPEN THE
PUBLIC HEARING.


[Captioner] 19:43:09
ARE THERE ANY SPEAKERS FOR THE
PUBLIC HEARING?


[Captioner] 19:43:18
>> Ms. Gauthier: THERE ARE NO
HANDS RAISED.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:43:21
AT THIS TIME, I'D LIKE TO CLOSE
THE PUBLIC HEARING, AND I WOULD
LIKE

[Captioner] 19:43:24
 TO GET COMMENTS FROM OUR
COUNCIL MEMBERS.


[Captioner] 19:43:28
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN.
>> Councilmember Salwan: 

[Captioner] 19:43:30
I
SUPPORT IT.
I THINK THAT'S A GREAT THING.


[Captioner] 19:43:33
WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT IT FOR
A LONG TIME, HOW WE NEED TO


[Captioner] 19:43:37
PRIORITIZE FREMONT RESIDENTS AND
FREMONT WORKERS, AND THIS
DIRECTLY

[Captioner] 19:43:40
 HAS A DIRECT EFFECT ON
THAT, SO I'M HAPPY TO MOVE THIS
FORWARD AT THE

[Captioner] 19:43:43
 RIGHT TIME.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK

[Captioner] 19:43:46
 YOU.
COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL.
>> Councilmember Campbell: 

[Captioner] 19:43:49
YES,
I ECHO MY FELLOW COUNCIL MEMBERS


[Captioner] 19:43:52
THAT I THINK THIS IS AN
EXCELLENT PROGRAM.
I THINK IT

[Captioner] 19:43:56
 WAS VERY WELL
WRITTEN, AND

[Captioner] 19:43:59
 THAT IT HAD LOTS OF
GREAT RESEARCH, SO

[Captioner] 19:44:03
 IT WASN'T
JUST, YOU KNOW,

[Captioner] 19:44:06
 FROM -- IT WAS
FROM FACT-BASED AND I THINK
THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT

[Captioner] 19:44:09
 THAT WE
CONTINUE TO SEE THAT.
COMING FROM

[Captioner] 19:44:12
 THE SCHOOL DISTRICT,
I ALSO

[Captioner] 19:44:15
 APPRECIATED SEEING SOME
OF THE IMPACT

[Captioner] 19:44:19
 OF WHAT HIGH COST
OF HOUSING IS FOR

[Captioner] 19:44:22
 DECLINING
ENROLLMENT, AND I THINK THAT'S
VERY IMPORTANT FOR

[Captioner] 19:44:25
 THIS
COMMUNITY BECAUSE WE DO HAVE A
GREAT EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM HERE,


[Captioner] 19:44:29
INCLUDING OHLONE COLLEGE, SO WE
ARE --

[Captioner] 19:44:32
 IF WE CAN RAISE OUR KIDS
UP TO

[Captioner] 19:44:36
 CONTINUE TO -- TO BE ABLE
TO LIVE HERE, THEN THEY'LL GO TO
SCHOOL AND THEY'LL

[Captioner] 19:44:39
 COME BACK AND
THEY'LL WORK FOR US, AND I THINK
THAT'S A

[Captioner] 19:44:43
 GOAL WORTH US FIGHTING
FOR.
SO

[Captioner] 19:44:46
 I DEFINITELY APPROVE OF THIS


[Captioner] 19:44:49
ITEM.
THANK

[Captioner] 19:44:51
 YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
COUNCILMEMBER KENG.


[Captioner] 19:44:54
AND I ALSO HAVE SOME COMMENTS
TOO.


[Captioner] 19:44:57
>> Vice Mayor Keng: THANK YOU,
MADAME MAYOR.
I AM ALSO VERY

[Captioner] 19:45:00
 SUPPORTIVE OF
THIS PROGRAM GIVING THE
OPPORTUNITY AND

[Captioner] 19:45:04
 PRIORITY TO OUR
CURRENT RESIDENTS WHO ALREADY
LIVE AND WORK

[Captioner] 19:45:07
 IN FREMONT TO GIVE
THEM THAT OPPORTUNITY OF


[Captioner] 19:45:11
AFFORDABLE HOUSING, SO I WOULD
BE FULLY SUPPORTIVE OF

[Captioner] 19:45:17
 MOVING
THIS FORWARD.
>> Mayor Mei: COUNCILMEMBER


[Captioner] 19:45:20
SHAO?
>> Councilmember Shao: THANK
YOU, MADAME MAYOR.


[Captioner] 19:45:23
I BELIEVE THE BEST WAY TO
SUPPORT IT IS TO MAKE A MOTION
FOR

[Captioner] 19:45:27
 IT, SO I MAKE A MOTION.
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:45:30
I HAVE STILL COMMENTS.

[Captioner] 19:45:32
 A MOTION --
>> Councilmember Campbell: I'LL

[Captioner] 19:45:36

COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL.
I WAS STILL GOING TO MAKE MY


[Captioner] 19:45:37

SORRY.
COUNCILMEMBER COX, DID YOU HAVE


[Captioner] 19:45:41
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS?
>> Councilmember Cox: I HAD JUST
SAID RIGHT BEFORE SHE DID THAT I


[Captioner] 19:45:44
HAD SECONDED, SO --
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY.


[Captioner] 19:45:47
I APOLOGIZE.
I ONLY HEARD HERS BECAUSE I
DIDN'T KNOW SHE WAS GOING TO


[Captioner] 19:45:50
JUMP IN, BUT -- WOULD YOU BE
FINE WITH

[Captioner] 19:45:54
 THAT?
COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL

[Captioner] 19:45:55
 IS VERY
AGREEABLE.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:45:59
COX IS THE SECOND.


[Captioner] 19:46:05
>> Mayor Mei: I WANTED TO NOTE I
APPRECIATE YOU, LUCY

[Captioner] 19:46:11
 LUCIA AND THE
TEAM AND COUNCILMEMBER SHAO

[Captioner] 19:46:16
 FOR
LOOKING AT THOSE AT RISK OF
DISPLACEMENT.


[Captioner] 19:46:20
IT IS A DETAILED STUDY THAT
CONCLUDED AT THE END THAT

[Captioner] 19:46:24

RENTERS ARE AT GREATER RISK AND
THERE'S A GREAT CHART IN

[Captioner] 19:46:27
 THERE
I'M HAPPY TO SHARE THAT
DISPLACEMENT FOR RENTERS IN


[Captioner] 19:46:31
ALAMEDA COUNTY OVERALL,
ESPECIALLY ON THE DATA OF
COMMUTE FLOWS

[Captioner] 19:46:34
 AND DECREASE IN
THE NUMBER OF

[Captioner] 19:46:37
 HOUSEHOLDS ABLE TO
AFFORD IT AND ALSO SURVEY


[Captioner] 19:46:40
RESULTS OF OUR LOCAL SOCIAL
SERVICE PROVIDERS.
WE JUST THIS

[Captioner] 19:46:43
 PAST WEEK HAD
RECOGNIZED ONE OF OUR

[Captioner] 19:46:46
 LEADERSHIP
MEMBERS WHO HAS BEEN MAKING A


[Captioner] 19:46:50
TREMENDOUS DIFFERENCE IN OUR
FREMONT FAMILY RESOURCE CENTER,
AND

[Captioner] 19:46:53
 AS ALSO

[Captioner] 19:46:57
 COUNCILMEMBER
CAMPBELL NOTED, SOME OF US HAD
SERVED ON THE SCHOOL BOARD

[Captioner] 19:46:59
 AND
THE ENROLLMENT TRENDS SUGGEST
THAT FREMONT RESIDENTS THAT ARE


[Captioner] 19:47:03
HERE ARE CURRENTLY BEING
DISPLACED, AND SO

[Captioner] 19:47:06
 I'VE ALSO
NOTED THIS AS AN ISSUE AND
CONCERN NOT JUST IN TERMS OF

[Captioner] 19:47:09
 THE
HOUSING BUT IN TRANSPORTATION,
SO HAVING THIS

[Captioner] 19:47:12
 PRIORITIZATION, I
THINK MAKES SENSE, AND HAVING
THIS POLICY.


[Captioner] 19:47:15
SO NOW WE HAVE A MOTION BY
COUNCILMEMBER SHAO AND

[Captioner] 19:47:18
 A SECOND
BY COUNCILMEMBER COX.
SO IF WE

[Captioner] 19:48:55
 PLEASURE TO

OUR CITY OF FREMONT HAS NEVER
HELD A

[Captioner] 19:49:02
 FLAG RAISING CEREMONY IN
HONOR OF

[Captioner] 19:49:05
 BLACK HISTORY MONTH
SINCE FREMONT WAS FOUNDED

[Captioner] 19:49:08
 BACK
IN 1956.


[Captioner] 19:49:12
AMERICANS

[Captioner] 19:49:15
 OF AFRICAN DESCENT
HAVE HELPED TO --

[Captioner] 19:49:18
 THAT CAN BE
ATTRIBUTED TO THE SPIRIT OF


[Captioner] 19:49:22
PERSEVERANCE AND DIVERSITY OF
CULTURES AND

[Captioner] 19:49:25
 TRADITIONS THAT ARE
CELEBRATED BY OUR RESIDENTS.


[Captioner] 19:49:28
WE KNOW THAT FROM THE WHITE
HOUSE TO

[Captioner] 19:49:32
 THE STATE OF ASSEMBLY
OF CALIFORNIA TO ALAMEDA

[Captioner] 19:49:36
 COUNTY,
WE HAVE

[Captioner] 19:49:39
 RECOGNIZED THAT AFRO
AMERICANS AND EVEN IN OUR OWN
COMMUNITY

[Captioner] 19:49:42
 HAVE PLAYED A
SIGNIFICANT ROLE HERE IN THE
HISTORY OF FREMONT, AND WE KNOW


[Captioner] 19:49:45
IT'S PART OF PROMOTING CULTURE
AND HISTORY AND THE

[Captioner] 19:49:48
 FIGHT
AGAINST RACISM AND

[Captioner] 19:49:52
 THE ADVANCE
OF THE CAUSE OF CIVIL RIGHTS.
AND THIS IS DATING BACK

[Captioner] 19:49:57
 TO --
FEBRUARY WAS SELECTED AS THE
MONTH

[Captioner] 19:50:00
 IN 1976 BY THE FATHER OF
BLACK HISTORY, CARTER

[Captioner] 19:50:04
 WOODSON,
WHO MADE SURE TO ADOPT THAT THIS
WOULD BE

[Captioner] 19:50:07
 SERVED AS THE MONTH OF
IMPORTANCE OF CELEBRATING BLACK
HISTORY

[Captioner] 19:50:10
 MONTH.
AND ALSO, WE KNOW THAT CITY

[Captioner] 19:50:14
 OF
FREMONT HAS ADOPTED A
COMPASSIONATE

[Captioner] 19:50:17
 CITY CHARTER BACK


[Captioner] 19:50:20
IN 2016 THAT IS COMMITTED TO
TREAT ALL PEOPLE

[Captioner] 19:50:23
 WITH JUSTICE,
EQUITY AND RESPECT IN EFFORTS TO


[Captioner] 19:50:27
BREAK DOWN POLITICAL AND ANY
TYPE OF RELIGIOUS

[Captioner] 19:50:30
 BOUNDARIES.
AND ALSO, THAT CITY OF

[Captioner] 19:50:33
 FREMONT
UNDER THIS COMPASSIONATE CITY


[Captioner] 19:50:37
CHARTER ALSO REAFFIRMS THAT

[Captioner] 19:50:40
 IT'S
ZERO TOLERANCE AND POLICY ON
DISCRIMINATION OR

[Captioner] 19:50:43
 ANTI-HATE OR
HARASSMENT.
SO LET US RECOGNIZE THAT FREMONT


[Captioner] 19:50:46

DIVERSITY AND PART OF THE
RECOMMENDATION TONIGHT

[Captioner] 19:52:00
 IS THIS,
IS TO DIRECT STAFF FOR FLAG
RAISING

[Captioner] 19:52:03
 CEREMONY IN HONOR OF
BLACK HISTORY MONTH STARTING IN


[Captioner] 19:52:07
FEBRUARY 2023, WE'RE LOOKING AT
THE FIRST BUSINESS DAY

[Captioner] 19:52:11
 IN
FREMONT, WHICH HAPPENS TO BE
THIS YEAR

[Captioner] 19:52:16
 IN 2023, WEDNESDAY,
12:00 FOR THE FLAG RAISING.


[Captioner] 19:52:19
THE PLACE, LOOKING AT THE
FREMONT DOWNTOWN

[Captioner] 19:52:23
 CENTERS, WHERE
THE FLAGPOLE IS, THE INTENT IS
TO

[Captioner] 19:52:27
 RAISE THE FLAG FOR THE ENTIRE
MONTH

[Captioner] 19:52:30
 OF FEBRUARY, AND THE
REASON SELECTING A BUSINESS DAY
IS

[Captioner] 19:52:34
 TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO
HAVE TIME OFF TO

[Captioner] 19:52:37
 ENJOY DURING
LUNCH HOUR SO THERE'S NO WORK
CONFLICTS, AND

[Captioner] 19:52:40
 ALSO WE'RE NOT
CHARGING FOR

[Captioner] 19:52:46
 OVERTIME.
THE FLAG HAS ALREADY BEEN
PURCHASED AND THIS WILL BE A WAY


[Captioner] 19:52:49
TO SHOW SUPPORT, FOSTER COMMON
VALUES AND COMMITMENTS TO UNITE
ALL

[Captioner] 19:52:52
 PEOPLE OF ALL RACES TOGETHER


[Captioner] 19:52:56
TO CELEBRATE BLACK HISTORY MONTH
AND TO ALSO IMPROVE OUR SOCIETY


[Captioner] 19:53:00
THAT WE CAN LIVE UP TO THE
IDEALS OF

[Captioner] 19:53:03
 FREEDOM, EQUITY AND
JUSTICE.
AND I WOULD

[Captioner] 19:53:06
 ASK FOR MY SUPPORT
FROM MY FELLOW

[Captioner] 19:53:09
 CITY
COUNCILMEMBERS TO STAND TOGETHER
AND TO UNITE OUR COMMUNITY.


[Captioner] 19:53:13
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:53:18
>> Mayor Mei: COUNCILMEMBER
KENG, DO YOU HAVE A QUESTION OR
COMMENT?


[Captioner] 19:53:26
>> Vice Mayor Keng: ALSO, BY THE
WAY, MY PROPER

[Captioner] 19:53:27
 TITLE NOW IS VICE
MAYOR.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:53:31
>> Mayor Mei: VICE MAYOR.
>> Vice Mayor Keng: THANK YOU SO
MUCH FOR THAT REFERRAL.


[Captioner] 19:53:35
EVERY FEBRUARY, THE U.S. HONORS
THE CONTRIBUTIONS AND

[Captioner] 19:53:39
 SACRIFICES
OF AFRICAN AMERICANS WHO HAVE
HELPED SHAPE THE

[Captioner] 19:53:42
 NATION.
BLACK HISTORY MONTH CELEBRATES
THE

[Captioner] 19:53:45
 RICH CULTURAL HERITAGE,


[Captioner] 19:53:48
TRIUMPH, AND ADVERSITY THAT ARE
AN

[Captioner] 19:53:52
 INDELIBLE PART OF OUR
COUNTRY'S HISTORY, SO I'M
THEREFORE

[Captioner] 19:53:55
 SUPPORTIVE OF HAVING A
FLAG RAISING CEREMONY

[Captioner] 19:53:57
 EVERY
FEBRUARY IN HONOR OF BLACK
HISTORY MONTH.


[Captioner] 19:54:02
I'LL BE HAPPY TO SECOND YOUR
MOTION.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU, VICE


[Captioner] 19:54:05
MAYOR.
THERE'S STILL PUBLIC COMMENTS.
SO

[Captioner] 19:54:08
 COUNCILMEMBER SHAO.


[Captioner] 19:54:12
>> Councilmember Shao: I HAVE A
CLARIFYING QUESTION.


[Captioner] 19:54:15
AND THEN I HAVE SOME COMMENTS
AFTER THE PUBLIC

[Captioner] 19:54:18
 COMMENTS.
THE

[Captioner] 19:54:22
 QUESTION FOR COUNCILMEMBER
COX IS,

[Captioner] 19:54:25
 WHAT FLAG IS GOING TO BE
RAISED?
BECAUSE THE REFERRAL DID NOT


[Captioner] 19:54:29
SPECIFY THE FLAG.
>> Councilmember Cox: THERE IS A


[Captioner] 19:54:32
BLACK HISTORY MONTH FLAG THAT
HAS

[Captioner] 19:54:35
 BLACK HISTORY ON IT.
IT

[Captioner] 19:54:39
 IS GOLD, BLACK,

[Captioner] 19:54:43
 RED, GREEN,
AND IT SIGNIFIES WHAT WOULD BE


[Captioner] 19:54:46
TRADITIONALLY RECOGNIZED AS A
BLACK HISTORY MONTH FLAG.


[Captioner] 19:54:53
>> Councilmember Shao: THANK
YOU.


[Captioner] 19:55:02
>> Mayor Mei: ARE THERE ANY
OTHER COMMENTS FROM THE COUNCIL?
I SAW YOUR HEAD NODDING BUT I


[Captioner] 19:55:04
WASN'T SURE IF THERE WAS
ANYTHING ELSE TO ADD.
NO?


[Captioner] 19:55:07
OKAY.
I JUST WANT TO MAKE

[Captioner] 19:55:10
 SURE.
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN, DID YOU
HAVE A COMMENT TOO?


[Captioner] 19:55:15
>> Councilmember Salwan:ABSOLUT
ELY.
WELL, I THINK THE STRUGGLE BY


[Captioner] 19:55:18
THE AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY
HAS BEEN A TREND

[Captioner] 19:55:21
 SETTER FOR LOTS
OF COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE

[Captioner] 19:55:24
 COME
AFTER, ESPECIALLY THE LANDMARK
CIVIL RIGHTS ACT.


[Captioner] 19:55:28
SO I UNDERSTAND THE INTENT AND I
APPRECIATE

[Captioner] 19:55:30
 COUNCILMEMBER COX
BRINGING THIS ISSUE TO
ATTENTION.


[Captioner] 19:55:34
I JUST HAVE A GENERAL KIND OF A
POLICY PRECEDENCE QUESTION.
DO

[Captioner] 19:55:37
 WE HAVE A FLAG POLICY OR


[Captioner] 19:55:41
ANYTHING TO HOW THIS SHOULD BE
DONE OR WHAT SORT

[Captioner] 19:55:44
 OF THINGS CAN
BE RECOGNIZED?
DO WE HAVE

[Captioner] 19:55:48
 SUCH A PROCEDURE IN
PLACE?


[Captioner] 19:55:51
>> City Mgr. Shackelford: ASIDE
FROM THE RAISING AND/OR LOWERING
OF THE

[Captioner] 19:55:54
 U.S. FLAG, WE DON'T HAVE
A FORMAL POLICY

[Captioner] 19:55:57
 FOR OTHER FLAGS.
>> Councilmember Salwan: OKAY.
SO IS

[Captioner] 19:56:00
 THAT SOMETHING AS PART OF
THIS REFERRAL, IF WE CAN COME UP
WITH

[Captioner] 19:56:05
 A POLICY

[Captioner] 19:56:07
 STREAMLINING --
>> Mayor Mei: OTHER --
>> Councilmember Salwan: FLAG


[Captioner] 19:56:11
RAISING IN GENERAL PLUS THE
CEREMONIAL FLAGS, AS WELL AS


[Captioner] 19:56:14
MAYBE A FURTHER DISCUSSION ABOUT
THE TYPE OF FLAGS WE WOULD LIKE


[Captioner] 19:56:17
TO FLY IN THE CITY OF FREMONT
AND ONES

[Captioner] 19:56:20
 WE DON'T, I THINK THAT
WOULD BE A FEUT F

[Captioner] 19:56:23
 -- A FRUITFUL
DISCUSSION.
SO IF YOU'RE OPEN TO THAT,


[Captioner] 19:56:26
COUNCILMEMBER COX, I THINK THAT
WOULD BE A GREAT DISCUSSION TO
HAVE

[Captioner] 19:56:30
 SO THAT WE CANNOT ONLY MAKE
SURE OUR AFRICAN AMERICAN


[Captioner] 19:56:33
COMMUNITY IS REPRESENTED, BUT
MANY OTHERS THAT ARE

[Captioner] 19:56:36
 ALSO --
WOULD LIKE TO BE RECOGNIZED.


[Captioner] 19:56:39
>> Councilmember Cox: YES, I
WOULD BE OPEN

[Captioner] 19:56:42
 TO LEADING THIS TO
MORE INFORMATION ON A

[Captioner] 19:56:45
 FLAG
POLICY TO BE SET BY CITY

[Captioner] 19:56:48
 STAFF
REGARDING THAT.
BUT THE INTENT OF THIS FLAG


[Captioner] 19:56:52
RAISING CEREMONY WAS

[Captioner] 19:56:55
 PURELY
DEDICATED FOR FEBRUARY, SO IT'S
KIND OF -- I

[Captioner] 19:56:58
 SEE IT AS TWO
DIFFERENT -- KIND OF LIKE TWO
DIFFERENT

[Captioner] 19:57:02
 ISSUES, BECAUSE YOU
KNOW, YOU DO WANT AS A REFERRAL
ACCEPT

[Captioner] 19:57:05
 IT AS IS, AND THEN THE
SECOND THAT COULD COME OUT OF IT
IS

[Captioner] 19:57:08
 HOW TO ESTABLISH A FLAG
POLICY.
SO I WOULD

[Captioner] 19:57:11
 LIKE TO KEEP THE TWO
SEPARATE BECAUSE THE POLICY
WOULD

[Captioner] 19:57:15
 THEN DICTATE LATER ON HOW
WE MOVE FORWARD.


[Captioner] 19:57:18
>> Councilmember Salwan: SO WE
CAN DO BOTH.
WE CAN MOVE THIS FORWARD AND


[Captioner] 19:57:21
ALSO HAVE A FLAG POLICY OR --
>> Mayor Mei: I THINK

[Captioner] 19:57:24
 WE SHOULD,
BECAUSE THEN WE HAVE SOME
GUIDELINES

[Captioner] 19:57:28
 FOR FUTURE --
>> Councilmember Salwan: I DON'T
KNOW IF THE CITY MANAGER HAS

[Captioner] 19:57:30
 ANY
FEEDBACK ON THAT?
GLRCHLT THE OTHER ONE WE'VE DONE


[Captioner] 19:57:34
THUS FAR IS THE PRIDE FLAG.
WE USED TO FLY IT HERE AT CITY


[Captioner] 19:57:37
COUNCIL CHAMBERS, AND THEN WE
NOW RAISE THAT FLAG.
IT'S USUALLY IN

[Captioner] 19:57:40
 THE MORNING, BUT
IF WE CAN HAVE SOME CONSISTENCY,
THAT

[Captioner] 19:57:43
 WAY WE'D BE ABLE TO HAVE --
IF THERE'S OTHER FLAGS THAT ARE
BEING RAISED,

[Captioner] 19:57:46
 THE CONSISTENT
POLICY.
AND ALSO DESIGNATING WHICH FLAGS


[Captioner] 19:57:50
ARE ELIGIBLE TO BE RAISED.


[Captioner] 19:57:53
>> City Mgr. Shackelford: SO YOU
CAN CERTAINLY DO WHAT
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN IS


[Captioner] 19:57:57
PROPOSING, APPROVE THIS ITEM
TONIGHT

[Captioner] 19:58:00
 AND ALSO ADD ON TO IT
DIRECTING STAFF TO COME

[Captioner] 19:58:04
 BACK
WITH RECOMMENDATIONS ON A POLICY
THAT YOU

[Captioner] 19:58:07
 ALL WOULD SET WITH


[Captioner] 19:58:11
REGARD TO FLAG RAISING.


[Captioner] 19:58:14
>> Mayor Mei: SO IN TERMS OF
CONSISTENCY IN TERMS OF HOW WE
DO IT.


[Captioner] 19:58:17
>> City Mgr. Shackelford: IN
TERMS OF CONSISTENCY IN HOW WE
DO IT.


[Captioner] 19:58:20
>> Mayor Mei: SURE.
COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL.


[Captioner] 19:58:23
>> Councilmember Campbell: YES,
I JUST WANTED TO MAKE A QUICK
COMMENT.


[Captioner] 19:58:26
I AM DEFINITELY IN FAVOR OF

[Captioner] 19:58:30
 THIS
REFERRAL.
I DO

[Captioner] 19:58:34
 RECOGNIZE THAT AMERICANS OF
AFRICAN

[Captioner] 19:58:37
 DESCENT HAVE MADE A
TREMENDOUS CONTRIBUTION TO


[Captioner] 19:58:41
AMERICA, IN ADDITION TO FREMONT.
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW DOWN

[Captioner] 19:58:44
 IN
IRVINGTON, THE

[Captioner] 19:58:47
 IRVINGTON DAVE
CENTER WAS CREATED FROM A


[Captioner] 19:58:52
PREVIOUS SLAVE RIGHT IN OUR OWN
CITY, SO WE HAVE SOME HISTORY IN


[Captioner] 19:58:55
OUR CITY.
SO I AM DEFINITELY IN SUPPORT OF


[Captioner] 19:58:59
THIS REFERRAL, AND THE RAISING
OF THE FLAG.
THANK

[Captioner] 19:59:03
 YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
I SEE COUNCILMEMBER SHAO BUT I


[Captioner] 19:59:06
ALSO WANT TO CHECK TO SEE IF
COUNCILMEMBER

[Captioner] 19:59:09
 KASSAN OR IF WE
HAVE PUBLIC SPEAKERS ON THIS


[Captioner] 19:59:11
ITEM.
NO?
NEXT IS COUNCILMEMBER SHAO.


[Captioner] 19:59:15
>> Councilmember Shao: THANK
YOU, MADAME MAYOR.


[Captioner] 19:59:20
BY LOOKING AT THE REFERRAL, I
HAVE TO COMMENT ON

[Captioner] 19:59:24
 COMMEND COUNCILMEMBER
COX FOR MAKING

[Captioner] 19:59:27
 THIS REFERRAL
BECAUSE THE LANGUAGE, PER SE, IS
VERY GOOD AND ACCURATE, AND

[Captioner] 19:59:30
 ALSO
THE INTENTION IS ALSO VERY GOOD.


[Captioner] 19:59:35
HOWEVER, WHEN I TRIED

[Captioner] 19:59:38
 TO MAKE
SOME THOUGHT ON -- PUT SOME
THOUGHTS ON

[Captioner] 19:59:41
 THIS REFERRAL, A
VOICE INSIDE

[Captioner] 19:59:45
 ME JUST REMINDED
ME, OH, BE CAREFUL

[Captioner] 19:59:48
 BECAUSE
WHATEVER YOU SAY, IF THERE'S


[Captioner] 19:59:51
ANYTHING OF

[Captioner] 19:59:55
 HESITATION OR
OPPOSITION, THEN LATER ON, IT
CAN BE TAKEN OUT

[Captioner] 19:59:59
 OF CONTEXT AND
USED AS A WEAPON TO

[Captioner] 20:00:03
 SMEAR YOU IN
YOUR FUTURE

[Captioner] 20:00:06
 POLITICAL CAREER,
WHICH ACTUALLY ALREADY HAPPENED


[Captioner] 20:00:09
TO ME FOR AN IR

[Captioner] 20:00:13
 IRRELEVANT REMARK

[Captioner] 20:00:16
 I
MADE IN 2017 AND USED AGAINST ME
IN 2018, AND

[Captioner] 20:00:19
 ALSO I SAW THE SAME
THING ABOUT, YOU

[Captioner] 20:00:22
 KNOW, MAKING A
COMMENT OR MAKING A

[Captioner] 20:00:25
 VOTE, AND
THEN THAT WILL HAUNT YOU BACK,
YOU KNOW,

[Captioner] 20:00:29
 IN OTHER PEOPLE'S
POLITICAL CAREER.


[Captioner] 20:00:33
SO FRANKLY SPEAKING, THERE WAS A


[Captioner] 20:00:37
FEAR INSIDE ME, AND THAT FEAR


[Captioner] 20:00:40
KEPT REMINDING ME, BE CAREFUL.


[Captioner] 20:00:44
SO ONE THING I WANT TO SAY AS A
REQUEST TO WHOEVER

[Captioner] 20:00:47
 IS WATCHING
THIS IS THAT NEXT TIME IF YOU


[Captioner] 20:00:51
WANT TO QUOTE ME, PLEASE QUOTE
MY

[Captioner] 20:00:55
 FOLLOWING COMMENT ENTIRELY.
IN ITS ENTIRETY,

[Captioner] 20:00:59
 NOT OUT OF
CONTEXT, BECAUSE NOT ONLY

[Captioner] 20:01:02
 ME,
NOBODY WANTS TO BE LABELED AS


[Captioner] 20:01:06
ANTI-BLACK, AS SOMEONE WHO
DOESN'T WANT TO CELEBRATE

[Captioner] 20:01:09
 BLACK
HISTORY MONTH OR WHO

[Captioner] 20:01:13
 IS AGAINST
MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.
TALKING

[Captioner] 20:01:17
 ABOUT MARTIN LUTHER
KING, JR., I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE
A QUOTE.


[Captioner] 20:01:21
HE SAYS, AN

[Captioner] 20:01:24
 INDIVIDUAL HASN'T
STARTED LIVING UNTIL HE

[Captioner] 20:01:29
 RISES
ABOVE THE CONFINES OF HIS


[Captioner] 20:01:32
INDIVIDUALIZED CONCERNS TO THE
BROADER

[Captioner] 20:01:36
 CONCERNS OF ALL HUMAN
KIND.


[Captioner] 20:01:39
SO IN THIS CASE,

[Captioner] 20:01:42
 I THINK RIGHT
NOW AS I'M

[Captioner] 20:01:46
 DEBATING ON THE VOTE,
I KEEP

[Captioner] 20:01:49
 TELLING MYSELF, SHOULD I
VOTE OUT OF

[Captioner] 20:01:52
 FEAR AS THE FEAR I
JUST MENTIONED, OR SHOULD

[Captioner] 20:01:55
 I VOTE
OUT OF THE INTELLIGENCE OR

[Captioner] 20:02:00
 THE
JUSTICE AS WE'RE SUPPOSED TO DO
AS THE

[Captioner] 20:02:06
 COUNCILMEMBERS IN A WHOLE
TO GOVERN THE CITY?
WELL, YOU MAY SAY,

[Captioner] 20:02:09
 COME ON, YOU
JUST SPECULATED ALL THE FEARS.


[Captioner] 20:02:13
SO I AGREE, I WANT TO STEP OUT
OF THE

[Captioner] 20:02:16
 SPECULATIONS AND COME
BACK TO THE FACTS.
WHAT ARE THE

[Captioner] 20:02:19
 FACTS?


[Captioner] 20:02:23
FACT, THE OHLONE CAME TO THIS
LAND

[Captioner] 20:02:27
 OF FREMONT A LONG, LONG
TIME AGO, BEFORE

[Captioner] 20:02:30
 ANYONE ELSE.
BEFORE THE

[Captioner] 20:02:34
 SPANISH MISSIONARIES
EVENTUALLY CAME AND SET

[Captioner] 20:02:37
 UP THE
SAN JOSÉ MISSION.


[Captioner] 20:02:41
AFTER THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE
STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND

[Captioner] 20:02:45
 THE
GOLDEN RUSH, THE CHINESE


[Captioner] 20:02:49
RAILROAD WORKERS CAME AND
SACRIFICED

[Captioner] 20:02:53
 THEIR LIFE, BUILDING
THE TRANSAMERICA

[Captioner] 20:02:57
 RAILROAD, WHICH
UNKNOWN TO MANY PEOPLE WAS
FINALLY

[Captioner] 20:03:02
 COMPLETED IN THE CITY OF
FREMONT IN NILES.


[Captioner] 20:03:07
FACT.
DURING -- AND

[Captioner] 20:03:11
 AFTER THAT, THERE
WAS THE CHINA EXCLUSION

[Captioner] 20:03:14
 ACT, 

[Captioner] 20:03:18
FORBIDDING THE CHINESE RAILROAD
WORKERS AND THEIR

[Captioner] 20:03:23
 DESCENDANTS
FROM ENJOYING THE RIGHTS THEY'RE
ENTITLED TO.


[Captioner] 20:03:26
IT'S NOT LIMITED TO THE CHINESE.
DURING WORLD WAR II,

[Captioner] 20:03:31
 MANY
JAPANESE AMERICAN FREMONT
RESIDENTS WERE TAKEN TO THE


[Captioner] 20:03:34
CAMP, BECOMING THE VICTIM OF
RACIAL DISCRIMINATION.


[Captioner] 20:03:39
FORTUNATELY, THE SOCIETY IS
MAKING A LOT OF

[Captioner] 20:03:42
 PROGRESS.
OVER THE YEARS, FREMONT

[Captioner] 20:03:46
 OPENED
ITS ARMS AND WELCOMED

[Captioner] 20:03:49
 PEOPLE
FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD.
WE ARE

[Captioner] 20:03:52
 ENJOYING A VERY DIVERSE
COMMUNITY,

[Captioner] 20:03:56
 OF WHICH, ACCORDING
TO THE LATEST

[Captioner] 20:04:01
 CENSUS, 66% ARE
ASIAN RESIDENTS.


[Captioner] 20:04:06
OF COURSE, WE ALSO

[Captioner] 20:04:09
 ARE PROUD OF
ALL THE ACHIEVEMENTS WE

[Captioner] 20:04:12
 HAVE
MADE HONORING THE AFRICAN


[Captioner] 20:04:16
AMERICAN COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND
RESIDENTS AMONG US.


[Captioner] 20:04:20
AS CITY COUNCILMEMBER COX JUST


[Captioner] 20:04:24
MENTIONED OR READ FROM A LONG
LIST, WE NOW HAVE

[Captioner] 20:04:28
 A FIRST
AFRICAN AMERICAN FIRE

[Captioner] 20:04:31
 CHIEF,
FIRST AFRICAN AMERICAN POLICE
CHIEF, FIRST AFRICAN AMERICAN


[Captioner] 20:04:36
CITY MANAGER, FIRST AFRICAN
AMERICAN CHIEF

[Captioner] 20:04:40
 TECHNOLOGY
OFFICER, AS WELL AS MANY OTHER
DEPARTMENT HEADS

[Captioner] 20:04:43
 AND LEADERS.


[Captioner] 20:04:46
COMPARATIVELY SPEAKING,

[Captioner] 20:04:49
 WE HAVE
TO MAKE MORE

[Captioner] 20:04:52
 PROGRESS ON ASIANS
WHO

[Captioner] 20:04:55
 MAKE UP FOR SUPERMAJORITY
PART OF THE CITY OF FREMONT.


[Captioner] 20:04:59
LOOKING AROUND, I DON'T SEE

[Captioner] 20:05:02
 ANY
ASIAN AMERICAN DEPARTMENT HEADS


[Captioner] 20:05:05
OR ANY SENIOR LEADERS IN THE
CITY OF FREMONT.


[Captioner] 20:05:10
DURING THE PANDEMIC, WE ALL
WITNESSED

[Captioner] 20:05:13
 THE RISE OF CRIMES
COMMITTED

[Captioner] 20:05:17
 AGAINST ASIAN
COMMUNITY.
AND WE

[Captioner] 20:05:20
 HAVE OUR OWN LOCAL
MOVEMENT TO

[Captioner] 20:05:23
 STOP ANTI-ASIAN
HATE.
BUT EVEN FOR

[Captioner] 20:05:26
 THAT, STILL, PEOPLE
ARE SHOUTING TO US,

[Captioner] 20:05:29
 HEY, GO BACK
TO CHINA!
OR ACCUSE

[Captioner] 20:05:33
 US OF BEING CHINESE
SPIES.


[Captioner] 20:05:37
BEFORE, DURING AND AFTER
ELECTIONS.


[Captioner] 20:05:42
SO, IN LIGHT OF WHAT I JUST HAVE
SAID ABOUT

[Captioner] 20:05:45
 THE FACTS,

[Captioner] 20:05:49
 EVEN IF
COUNCILMEMBER COX WOULD AGREE TO


[Captioner] 20:05:52
ACCEPT A FRIENDLY MODIFICATION
OF

[Captioner] 20:05:55
 HER REFERRAL

[Captioner] 20:05:59
 AND CHANGE THE
OCCASION OF FLAG

[Captioner] 20:06:03
 RAISING
FEBRUARY BLACK HISTORY MONTH TO,
LET'S SAY,

[Captioner] 20:06:06
 MAY, THE ASIAN
HERITAGE MONTH, THAT

[Captioner] 20:06:10
 ACTUALLY
STILL WOULD

[Captioner] 20:06:13
 CAUSE A PROBLEM.
WHY?
BECAUSE REMEMBER, MARTIN LUTHER


[Captioner] 20:06:16
KING, JR. REMINDS US THAT WE
HAVE

[Captioner] 20:06:21
 TO ADDRESS THE BROADER
CONCERNS OF ALL HUMAN

[Captioner] 20:06:25
 KIND.
OR NAMELY, THE CONCERNS OF

[Captioner] 20:06:28
 THE
FREMONT RESIDENTS.
WHAT ARE

[Captioner] 20:06:34
 THOSE?
DURING MY CAMPAIGN, SEASON ON MY
CAMPAIGN TRACK,

[Captioner] 20:06:37
 I TALKED TO A
LOT OF VOTERS.
THEY ALL EXPRESSED

[Captioner] 20:06:40
 THEIR
CONCERNS REGARDING

[Captioner] 20:06:43
 THE PUBLIC
SAFETY,

[Captioner] 20:06:46
 THE LOCAL TRAFFIC, THE
RESPONSIVENESS TO

[Captioner] 20:06:50
 HOMELESS
PEOPLE,

[Captioner] 20:06:54
 AND OUR PHYSICAL HEALTH
AMONG OTHER

[Captioner] 20:06:57
 ISSUES.
SO MY QUESTION IS,

[Captioner] 20:07:00
 WOULD THIS
REFERRAL HELP

[Captioner] 20:07:05
 US ADDRESS ALL
THOSE CONCERNS, WHICH
COINCIDENCELY

[Captioner] 20:07:13
 WHICH
COINCIDENTALLY ARE THE SAME TOP
PRIORITIES THE CITY COUNCIL


[Captioner] 20:07:17
AGREED TO IN OUR LAST ANNUAL
RETREAT.
OR ON THE FLIP

[Captioner] 20:07:22
 SIDE, WITHOUT


[Captioner] 20:07:25
THIS CEREMONIAL EVENT, WOULD

[Captioner] 20:07:29
 IT
HURT FOR THE CITY COUNCILMEMBERS
AND ALL THE

[Captioner] 20:07:32
 CITY STAFF

[Captioner] 20:07:37
 TO
CONCENTRATE THEIR EFFORT AND TRY
TO REALLY

[Captioner] 20:07:40
 MAKE EFFORTS TO,


[Captioner] 20:07:43
ACCORDING TO THE TOP

[Captioner] 20:07:48
 PRIORITIES.
ANOTHER FACT.
EVERY

[Captioner] 20:07:52
 JULY 4TH, PEOPLE,
REGARDLESS WHERE THEY COME FROM,


[Captioner] 20:07:55
HOW LONG HAVE THEY BEEN HERE IN
FREMONT, ALL COME

[Captioner] 20:07:59
 TOGETHER,
UNITED UNDER THE STARS

[Captioner] 20:08:05
 AND
STRIPE BANNER, FLYING PROUDLY


[Captioner] 20:08:08
ABOVE FREMONT,

[Captioner] 20:08:11
 PARTICIPATE IN
THE PARADE.
NOT ONLY

[Captioner] 20:08:14
 CELEBRATING THEIR OWN
ETHNIC AND CULTURAL

[Captioner] 20:08:17
 BACKGROUND,
BUT OVERALL,

[Captioner] 20:08:20
 CELEBRATE THE
BIRTHDAY OF UNITED STATES OF


[Captioner] 20:08:24
AMERICA, GREET EACH OTHER
EXPRESSING LOVE AND CARE TO EACH
OTHER,

[Captioner] 20:08:27
 PASSING AROUND EVEN A
BOTTLE OF COLD OR

[Captioner] 20:08:32
 CHILLED WATER
ON THEMSELVES TO SHOW LOVE AND
CARE,

[Captioner] 20:08:35
 AND WHETHER THEY ARE IN
THE PARADE OR STANDING OR


[Captioner] 20:08:39
SITTING BY THE ROAD WATCHING THE
PARADE, THEY

[Captioner] 20:08:42
 WAVE THE FLAG
PROUDLY AND THEN THEY

[Captioner] 20:08:47
 REALLY
CELEBRATE THE COMMON VALUES

[Captioner] 20:08:51
 AND
THE COMMON INTEREST OF

[Captioner] 20:08:54
 THE
SOCIETY, WHICH IS FREEDOM AND
EQUITY.


[Captioner] 20:08:59
AND I BELIEVE IT IS A PERFECT


[Captioner] 20:09:06
EMBODIMENT IN FREMONT TO SHOW
OUR VALUE AS

[Captioner] 20:09:09
 THE HAPPIEST CITY
AND THE MOST CARING CITY IN

[Captioner] 20:09:12
 THE
UNITED

[Captioner] 20:09:17
 STATES.
SO, GOING BACK TO MARTIN LUTHER
KING,

[Captioner] 20:09:21
 JR., WHO TOLD US TO DO THE
RIGHT THING AT THE

[Captioner] 20:09:24
 RIGHT TIME, I
BELIEVE

[Captioner] 20:09:28
 JULY 4TH HAS ALREADY
BEEN THE

[Captioner] 20:09:32
 PERFECT EVENT WHERE
PEOPLE, REGARDLESS

[Captioner] 20:09:35
 OF THEIR
IDENTITY, COULD

[Captioner] 20:09:38
 UNITE AND


[Captioner] 20:09:42
CELEBRATE, AND THAT EVENT WILL


[Captioner] 20:09:46
PREVENT US FROM SETTING A
PRECEDENT WHERE LATER ON,

[Captioner] 20:09:49
 WE
HAVE TO STRUGGLE AND SAY, HEY,
WHAT

[Captioner] 20:09:52
 ABOUT THIS FLAG, WHAT ABOUT


[Captioner] 20:09:56
THAT EVENT?
I JUST ATTENDED AN EVENT

[Captioner] 20:09:59
 TO
CELEBRATE HANUKKAH YESTERDAY,
DURING WHICH

[Captioner] 20:10:03
 SOME COMMUNITY
MEMBERS EXPRESSED THAT

[Captioner] 20:10:06
 THERE'S
STILL FEAR OF RECEIVING THREATS


[Captioner] 20:10:09
AND STILL LIVING UNDER THE FEAR
OF

[Captioner] 20:10:12
 ANTI-SEMITISM.


[Captioner] 20:10:15
SO IF THEY COME AND TRY

[Captioner] 20:10:19
 TO MAKE
A SIMILAR REQUEST, WILL

[Captioner] 20:10:22
 WE THEN
TRY TO ACCOMMODATE THEM AND

[Captioner] 20:10:25
 THEN
FLY ANOTHER FLAG ON ANOTHER DAY?


[Captioner] 20:10:28
AND OF COURSE, THIS LIST COULD
ONLY GO ON.
WHO

[Captioner] 20:10:32
 DARE TO SAY, OH, YOUR GROUP
IS NOT IMPORTANT, YOUR GROUP

[Captioner] 20:10:35
 IS
NOT MAKING ENOUGH CONTRIBUTION,
SO WE HAVE TO

[Captioner] 20:10:38
 SAY NO TO YOU.


[Captioner] 20:10:41
CONSIDERING THAT WE HAVE BEEN
TALKING ABOUT

[Captioner] 20:10:46
 STREAMLINING THIS
CEREMONIAL EVENTS AS THE COUNCIL


[Captioner] 20:10:49
AND THEN REALLY CONCENTRATE OUR
EFFORTS AND OUR

[Captioner] 20:10:53
 STAFF'S TIME TO
ADDRESS ALL THE

[Captioner] 20:10:56
 PRESSING ISSUES
IN

[Captioner] 20:11:00
 OUR COMMUNITY, AND GIVEN THAT
JULY 4TH HAS BEEN

[Captioner] 20:11:03
 THE PERFECT
EVENT FOR ALL OF US

[Captioner] 20:11:07
 TO CELEBRATE
UNDER THE FLAG OF THE

[Captioner] 20:11:11
 STARS AND
STRIPES BANNER,

[Captioner] 20:11:14
 I WOULD PROPOSE


[Captioner] 20:11:17
THAT WE TABLE THIS REFERRAL AND


[Captioner] 20:11:20
THEN COME UP WITH A POLICY

[Captioner] 20:11:23
 FOR
THE CITY COUNCIL TO

[Captioner] 20:11:27
 REALLY
ADDRESS THE CEREMONIAL EVENTS
INCLUDING

[Captioner] 20:11:30
 THIS.
AND THEN TRY TO COME UP WITH

[Captioner] 20:11:34
 A
POLICY THAT WOULD TRULY

[Captioner] 20:11:39
 REFLECT
THE CORE VALUES OF FREMONT,
WHICH IS FREEDOM

[Captioner] 20:11:42
 AND EQUITY AND
UNITY.
THAT IS MY COMMENT.


[Captioner] 20:11:47
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
COUNCILMEMBER

[Captioner] 20:11:51
 COX.


[Captioner] 20:11:54
>> Councilmember Cox: YES, I DID
WANT TO ADD THAT WE HAVE STATED


[Captioner] 20:11:57
AT PREVIOUS CITY COUNCIL
MEETINGS THAT WE WOULD BE


[Captioner] 20:12:01
ADDRESSING THE CEREMONIAL ITEMS
AT OUR UPCOMING

[Captioner] 20:12:04
 RETREAT,
INCLUDING A LIST OF THE


[Captioner] 20:12:08
PROCLAMATIONS THAT WE'RE GOING
TO OUTLINE FOR THE WHOLE YEAR,


[Captioner] 20:12:12
WHICH REPRESENT A LITTLE BIT OF
EVERYONE'S

[Captioner] 20:12:15
 CULTURE, AND THINGS
TO CELEBRATE THAT WOULD BRING


[Captioner] 20:12:18
EVERYONE INTO FREEDOM AND EQUITY
AND JUSTICE.


[Captioner] 20:12:21
THE OTHER PART IS THAT I DO
WELCOME

[Captioner] 20:12:24
 HAVING A FLAG POLICY,
AND MAYBE THAT'S SOMETHING

[Captioner] 20:12:28
 THAT
CAN BE ADDRESSED EVEN AT OUR
UPCOMING RETREAT

[Captioner] 20:12:32
 AS WELL, AND
ALSO IN

[Captioner] 20:12:36
 ADDITION, THE CITY OF
FREMONT HAS LISTED, AND WE ALL


[Captioner] 20:12:39
VOTED AS CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS ON
PAST EVENTS, SUCH AS THE

[Captioner] 20:12:44
 PARADE
IN AUGUST WITH

[Captioner] 20:12:48
 THE INDO-AMERICAN
COMMUNITY, PARADE

[Captioner] 20:12:51
 OF
INDEPENDENCE DAY.
WE ALSO HAVE CELEBRATED

[Captioner] 20:12:55
 AND
GIVEN MONEYS EVEN THAT IT COMING
UP IN

[Captioner] 20:12:58
 JANUARY, THE 14TH, THAT
OUR FREMONT

[Captioner] 20:13:02
 DOWNTOWN CENTER,
THAT WE'RE CELEBRATING THE

[Captioner] 20:13:04
 LUNAR
NEW YEAR.
SO WE ARE REACHING OUT TO DO


[Captioner] 20:13:07
DIFFERENT CELEBRATIONS OF
ACTIVITIES HAPPENING

[Captioner] 20:13:10
 IN OUR
COMMUNITY, AND FOR ALL OF US TO
PARTAKE

[Captioner] 20:13:15
 AND CELEBRATE AS WE
DESIRE.
AND

[Captioner] 20:13:18
 IN SUPPORT OF THE DIFFERENT
COMMUNITIES THAT WE HAVE HERE.
SO

[Captioner] 20:13:21
 I JUST WANTED TO KIND OF TIE
THAT IN TOGETHER.


[Captioner] 20:13:24
AND OTHER GROUPS HAVE PUT ON
EVENTS TO BRING

[Captioner] 20:13:28
 PEOPLE TOGETHER
THROUGHOUT OUR COMMUNITY, AND
IT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY

[Captioner] 20:13:32
 AS CITY
COUNCILMEMBERS TO, THEREFORE,
ATTEND

[Captioner] 20:13:35
 BUT ALSO FIND WAYS

[Captioner] 20:13:38
 TO
BRING ITEMS TO BE VOTED ON

[Captioner] 20:13:41
 HERE
AT CITY

[Captioner] 20:13:44
 DOWN THAT HAVEN'T BEEN
DONE BEFORE, BUT ACCEPTING
THINGS THAT WE CAN ALSO

[Captioner] 20:13:47
 ALWAYS
INCLUDE AND THINK OF OTHERS.
SO WITH THE

[Captioner] 20:13:50
 THINGS THAT WE HAVE
AND MORE TO COME, I LOOK FORWARD
TO

[Captioner] 20:13:54
 SOME MORE DISCUSSION,
ESPECIALLY AT

[Captioner] 20:13:57
 OUR UPCOMING CITY
COUNCIL RETREAT.


[Captioner] 20:14:02
>> Mayor Mei: COUNCILMEMBER
KENG.
I'LL ADD MY COMMENTS

[Captioner] 20:14:04
 WHEN WE'RE
DONE.
>> Vice Mayor Keng: THANK YOU,


[Captioner] 20:14:08
MAYOR.
I UNDERSTAND AND I

[Captioner] 20:14:11
 CAN
UNDERSTAND COUNCILMEMBER SHAO'S


[Captioner] 20:14:15
COMMENT, BEING AN ASIAN AMERICAN
AND WITH

[Captioner] 20:14:19
 THE RECENT LAST COUPLE
YEARS OF

[Captioner] 20:14:22
 THERE IS A LOT OF

[Captioner] 20:14:26

ANTI-ASIAN -- HOWEVER, WE ARE
HERE TALKING ABOUT

[Captioner] 20:14:29
 RECOGNIZING
THE CONTRIBUTION OF THE

[Captioner] 20:14:32
 BLACK
HISTORY -- BLACK HISTORY MONTH


[Captioner] 20:14:36
AND BLACK AMERICAN IN THE PAST.
SO I THINK,

[Captioner] 20:14:39
 YOU KNOW, IF WE USE
YOUR LOGIC, THEN, YOU

[Captioner] 20:14:42
 KNOW, WE
PROBABLY

[Captioner] 20:14:46
 SHOULDN'T CONTINUE WHAT
WE DID RAISING

[Captioner] 20:14:50
 THE LGBT FLAG
THAT WE DID IN THE PAST COUPLE
YEARS, SO I THINK

[Captioner] 20:14:53
 WE WANT TO
RECOGNIZE THE DIFFERENT ETHNIC


[Captioner] 20:14:56
GROUPS, OF COURSE, IT'S HARD TO
RECOGNIZE EVERY SINGLE

[Captioner] 20:15:01
 GROUP,
BUT IN THE COMING FEBRUARY, THE
CITY

[Captioner] 20:15:04
 WILL BE HOSTING A LUNAR NEW


[Captioner] 20:15:08
YEAR CELEBRATION FOR THE ASIAN
AMERICAN, YOU

[Captioner] 20:15:11
 KNOW, BECAUSE IT
HAS BEEN

[Captioner] 20:15:14
 RECENTLY -- WE RECENTLY
HAVE A BILL AT THE STATE
LEGISLATURE THAT

[Captioner] 20:15:17
 WE WILL BE
CELEBRATING

[Captioner] 20:15:21
 LUNAR NEW YEAR, AND
IT WILL BE A HOLIDAY, SO I

[Captioner] 20:15:24
 THINK
THAT, YOU KNOW, IT IS --

[Captioner] 20:15:28
 I DO
SUPPORT THAT WE HAVE A

[Captioner] 20:15:31
 FLAG
PROGRAM, BUT I THINK

[Captioner] 20:15:35
 WE CAN --
PERHAPS IF NO OTHER COMMENT, WE


[Captioner] 20:15:38
CAN ALSO MOVE FORWARD.
>> Mayor Mei: THERE'S OTHER
COMMENTS

[Captioner] 20:15:41
 STILL.
>> Vice Mayor Keng: SURE.
>> Mayor Mei: COUNCILMEMBER


[Captioner] 20:15:43
CAMPBELL.
>> Councilmember Campbell: I'M
SORRY, MAYOR MEI, BUT I'M JUST


[Captioner] 20:15:47
CONFUSED AS TO WHERE WE ARE.
I THOUGHT THERE WAS A MOTION AND
A SECOND, AND

[Captioner] 20:15:50
 WE WERE IN THE
PROCESS OF DISCUSSION.
>> Mayor Mei: YES.


[Captioner] 20:15:54
>> Councilmember Campbell: AND
THEN --
>> Mayor Mei: WE ARE IN THE


[Captioner] 20:15:57
PROCESS OF DISCUSSION.
>> Councilmember Campbell: OKAY.


[Captioner] 20:16:02
COUNCILMEMBER SHAO OFFERED A
FRIENDLY

[Captioner] 20:16:05
 AMENDMENT AND IT WAS
GLOSSED OVER, SO

[Captioner] 20:16:09
 IS THAT -- ARE
WE NOT ALLOWING HIS FRIENDLY


[Captioner] 20:16:12
AMENDMENT, ARE WE NOT ADDRESSING
IT OR --
>> Mayor Mei: WELL, WE HAVE A


[Captioner] 20:16:15
FRIENDLY AMENDMENT BUT I DON'T
KNOW IF WE HAVE A SECOND.
>> Councilmember Campbell: OKAY,


[Captioner] 20:16:18
BUT WE DIDN'T ADDRESS IT AT THE
TIME THAT IT WAS RAISED.


[Captioner] 20:16:21
SO -- AND SO I'M JUST KIND OF
CONFUSED AS

[Captioner] 20:16:24
 TO WHERE WE ARE
PROCEDURALLY.
>> Mayor Mei: 

[Captioner] 20:16:28
PROCEDURALLY, I
WASN'T SURE IF THAT WAS ACTUALLY
A MOTION, THOUGH, FROM

[Captioner] 20:16:31
 HIM,
BECAUSE IT SOUNDED LIKE A
COMMENT BUT -- WAS THAT AN


[Captioner] 20:16:35
AMENDMENT TO YOUR MOTION?


[Captioner] 20:16:39
>> Councilmember Shao: THANK
YOU, MADAME MAYOR.
IT IS A COMMENT, NOT AN


[Captioner] 20:16:42
AMENDMENT.


[Captioner] 20:16:46
MY AMENDMENT WOULD BE TO TABLE
THIS UNTIL

[Captioner] 20:16:49
 THE RETREAT SO WE CAN
HAVE A BETTER DISCUSSION.


[Captioner] 20:16:53
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: THROUGH
THE CHAIR?
>> Mayor Mei: YES.


[Captioner] 20:16:55
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: I DON'T
HAVE A RECORDED MOTION IN MY
NOTES.


[Captioner] 20:16:58
MAYBE I CAN

[Captioner] 20:17:01
 DEFER TO CONFIRM
WITH CITY CLERK GAUTHIER

[Captioner] 20:17:03
 IF
THERE'S ONE.
DID YOU CAPTURE A MOTION?


[Captioner] 20:17:06
I HAVE NOT.
>> Mayor Mei: I HAVE NOT.


[Captioner] 20:17:10
>> Ms. Gauthier: I DID NOT HEAR
AN OFFICIAL MOTION OR A SECOND
TO

[Captioner] 20:17:17
 THE INITIAL.
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: I'M IN
THE SAME PLACE.


[Captioner] 20:17:20
>> Ms. Gauthier: I'M JUST
HEARING A POTENTIAL FRIENDLY
AMENDMENT.


[Captioner] 20:17:23
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: WHERE
WE ARE NOW, THERE'S NO MOTION SO
THERE'S

[Captioner] 20:17:26
 NO AMENDMENT TO A
MOTION.
WHAT WE HAVE NOW, I THINK, IS


[Captioner] 20:17:29
POTENTIALLY A MOTION

[Captioner] 20:17:33
 TO TABLE.
>> Mayor Mei: YOU'RE ASKING TO
MOTION TO TABLE,

[Captioner] 20:17:35
 COUNCILMEMBER
SHAO?
IS THAT --


[Captioner] 20:17:38
>> Councilmember Campbell: I'M
NOT IN FAVOR OF THAT.
>> Councilmember Shao: CONFIRMED


[Captioner] 20:17:41
, THERE IS A MOTION TO

[Captioner] 20:17:45
 TABLE.
>> Councilmember Cox: I'M GOING
TO DO A SUBSTITUTE MOTION TO


[Captioner] 20:17:48
MOVE FORWARD WITH THE
RECOMMENDATIONS THAT ARE

[Captioner] 20:17:50
 WRITTEN
IN THE COUNCIL REFERRAL TONIGHT.
>> Councilmember Campbell: I'LL


[Captioner] 20:17:53
SECOND THAT, PLEASE.
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY.
MOTION AND SECOND.


[Captioner] 20:17:56
I HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO SPEAK
AT ALL, AND I THINK
COUNCILMEMBER

[Captioner] 20:17:59
 SALWAN HAS --
>> Councilmember Kassan: I

[Captioner] 20:18:01
 HAVE
MY HAND RAISED ALSO.
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY.


[Captioner] 20:18:05
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, I DON'T
APOLOGIZE BECAUSE THE CLERK CAN
SEE IT BUT I

[Captioner] 20:18:07
 CAN'T.
>> Councilmember Kassan: SHOULD
I GO AHEAD?


[Captioner] 20:18:09
>> Mayor Mei: GO AHEAD.
>> Councilmember Kassan: OKAY.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:18:13
YEAH, YOU KNOW, I REALLY HEAR
THAT WE HAVE

[Captioner] 20:18:16
 SUCH A DIVERSE
COMMUNITY AND IT'S SO IMPORTANT


[Captioner] 20:18:19
TO RECOGNIZE EVERYONE AND MAKE
SURE EVERYONE

[Captioner] 20:18:23
 FEELS THAT THEY'RE
VALUED, BUT YOU KNOW,
COUNCILMEMBER COX DID

[Captioner] 20:18:26
 TAKE THE
TIME TO BRING THIS MOTION
TONIGHT, AND

[Captioner] 20:18:30
 I THINK, YOU KNOW,
TALKING ABOUT ALL OF THE

[Captioner] 20:18:35
 OTHER
GROUPS OR THIS REFERRAL, SORRY,
THERE'S SO MANY OTHER

[Captioner] 20:18:38
 GROUPS
THAT SOMEONE COULD BRING A
REFERRAL ABOUT,

[Captioner] 20:18:41
 BUT NO ONE ELSE
HAS BROUGHT A REFERRAL ABOUT ANY
OTHER GROUP OR

[Captioner] 20:18:44
 RECOGNIZING ANY
OTHER GROUP.
THIS REFERRAL IS ABOUT

[Captioner] 20:18:47
 THIS
PARTICULAR RECOGNITION, AND SO I
THINK

[Captioner] 20:18:50
 SAYING LIKE, WELL, WE
COULD HAVE RECOGNIZED A LOT OF
OTHER GROUPS

[Captioner] 20:18:53
 IS REALLY NOT
RELEVANT, YOU KNOW,


[Captioner] 20:18:57
COUNCILMEMBER COX TOOK THE TIME
TO BRING THIS PARTICULAR
REFERRAL SO I THINK

[Captioner] 20:19:00
 WE SHOULD,
YOU KNOW, EVALUATE IT ON ITS
FACE AND

[Captioner] 20:19:03
 NOT LIST ALL THE OTHER
GROUPS THAT

[Captioner] 20:19:06
 WE COULD DO SIMILAR
RECOGNITIONS.
SO I

[Captioner] 20:19:09
 JUST HOPE WE'LL STAY
FOCUSED ON THE PROPOSAL

[Captioner] 20:19:13
 AT HAND
AND JUST VOTE ON IT, YOU KNOW,
ON ITS OWN

[Captioner] 20:19:16
 MERITS.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:19:19
>> Mayor Mei: COUNCILMEMBER
SALWAN.


[Captioner] 20:19:23
>> Councilmember Salwan: THANK
YOU, MADAME MAYOR.
YEAH, I THINK THIS IS A

[Captioner] 20:19:27
 VERY
TIMELY DISCUSSION AND, YOU KNOW,
I'M GLAD WE'RE HAVING THIS, AS


[Captioner] 20:19:30
WE'RE BECOMING A LARGER CITY.


[Captioner] 20:19:33
MANY OTHER CITIES HAVE ALL KINDS
OF

[Captioner] 20:19:37
 PROCLAMATIONS AND EVENTS AND
FLAG RAISINGS.
SO I

[Captioner] 20:19:40
 THINK WE SHOULD SUPPORT
COUNCILMEMBER

[Captioner] 20:19:44
 COX'S REFERRAL.
SO I THINK IT'S THE RIGHT

[Captioner] 20:19:47
 THING
TO DO.
I STILL WOULD

[Captioner] 20:19:50
 LIKE TO ASK FOR A
FRIENDLY AMENDMENT TO SEE IF WE
CAN HAVE

[Captioner] 20:19:54
 A FORMAL FLAG RAISING
POLICY LIKE WE SEE

[Captioner] 20:19:57
 IN OTHER
CITIES LIKE SAN JOSÉ, SANTA
CLARA

[Captioner] 20:20:01
 COUNTY, CITY OF SANTA
CLARA, AND THIS CAN

[Captioner] 20:20:04
 SPECIFY WHAT
SORT OF FLAG RAISINGS WILL OCCUR
WITHIN A YEAR.


[Captioner] 20:20:07
AND THEY ALSO OUTLINE THINGS
THAT

[Captioner] 20:20:10
 CANNOT OCCUR, AND

[Captioner] 20:20:14
 THAT THE
FLAG

[Captioner] 20:20:18
 POLICIES ARE MEANT FOR THE
BODY, THE COUNCIL ITSELF AND

[Captioner] 20:20:21
 NOT
FOR THE GENERAL PUBLIC.


[Captioner] 20:20:26
ALSO IT CAN EXCLUDE CERTAIN
FORMS OF HATE SPEECH

[Captioner] 20:20:29
 OR AVOIDING
RELIGIOUS TYPE FLAG

[Captioner] 20:20:33
 RAISINGS.
SO THERE'S A LOT THAT WE CAN GET
FROM

[Captioner] 20:20:36
 THIS DISCUSSION.
SO AGAIN FROM PROCEDURE,


[Captioner] 20:20:40
PROTOCOL, PROCESS, I THINK IT'S
BETTER TO

[Captioner] 20:20:43
 HAVE MORE OF A
HOLISTIC APPROACH RATHER THAN A


[Captioner] 20:20:47
ONE-OFF.
I DON'T WANT TO SEE NEXT WEEK OR
WHEN WE COME BACK IN

[Captioner] 20:20:50
 JANUARY,
ONE OF THE OTHER COUNCILMEMBERS
HAS ANOTHER ONE FOR

[Captioner] 20:20:52
 ANOTHER
GROUP.
WHICH WE CAN DO THAT, BUT THEN


[Captioner] 20:20:56
IT DOESN'T MAKE FOR EFFICIENT
MEETINGS, SO I THINK WE SHOULD
TAKE

[Captioner] 20:20:59
 THIS OPPORTUNITY, MOVE THIS
FORWARD, AND ALSO SEE HOW WE CAN


[Captioner] 20:21:02
HAVE A MORE FORMAL FLAG POLICY
SO THAT

[Captioner] 20:21:06
 WE CAN JOIN THE BIG
CITIES AND SEE HOW THEY

[Captioner] 20:21:08
 DO THAT
AND WE SHOULD HAVE OUR OWN
VERSION OF THAT.


[Captioner] 20:21:11
SO I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE A
FURTHER DISCUSSION WHAT SORT OF


[Captioner] 20:21:14
THINGS THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE
THERE RATHER

[Captioner] 20:21:18
 THAN JUST ONE
MEETING HERE.
>> Mayor Mei: ABSOLUTELY.


[Captioner] 20:21:22
>> Councilmember Salwan: I'M NOT
SURE IF YOU'RE OPEN TO THAT.
>> Councilmember Cox: LET ME LET


[Captioner] 20:21:25
THE MAYOR SPEAK FIRST.
>> Mayor Mei: YES, I HAVEN'T HAD
A CHANCE TO SPEAK YET.


[Captioner] 20:21:29
I ABSOLUTELY AM SUPPORTIVE OF
THIS, AND I WILL SAY THAT I


[Captioner] 20:21:33
ABSOLUTELY UNDERSTAND THE
FEELING FROM --

[Captioner] 20:21:36
 OR SOME OF THE
STATEMENTS FROM COUNCILMEMBER
SHOO-IN

[Captioner] 20:21:40
 TERMS OF HOW THINGS CAN
BE

[Captioner] 20:21:44
 MISCONSTRUED OR MISRELAYED.
IN FACT, I SAT VERY MUCH AT

[Captioner] 20:21:47
 THIS
DAIS MANY YEARS AGO WHEN THERE
WAS A DISCUSSION

[Captioner] 20:21:50
 WHERE I'D ASKED
FOR INCLUSION FOR

[Captioner] 20:21:53
 ASIANS AT THAT
TIME, AND WAS SHOT DOWN,

[Captioner] 20:21:57
 AND
THEN MORE

[Captioner] 20:22:00
 RECENTLY WAS
MISCONSTRUED OR MISREPRESENTED
AS NOT

[Captioner] 20:22:03
 SUPPORTING CERTAIN GROUPS
BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT I ASKED


[Captioner] 20:22:06
FOR THE INCLUSION OF ASIANS AT
THAT TIME.
AND

[Captioner] 20:22:09
 SO I AM VERY SUPPORTIVE OF
THIS, BUT I THINK IT IS


[Captioner] 20:22:13
IMPORTANT THAT WE BEING THE
SIXTH LARGEST ASIAN

[Captioner] 20:22:16
 CITY, BEING
ONE CITY THAT'S VERY PROUD OF
OUR

[Captioner] 20:22:19
 LATINO HERITAGE, AND ALSO
FOR

[Captioner] 20:22:22
 THE PAST THAT WE'VE HAD HERE
IN THEIR HISTORY

[Captioner] 20:22:26
 WITH THE
JAPANESE INTERMENT AND FRED

[Captioner] 20:22:30

KORMATSU AS WELL AS THE FACT
THAT THIS IS IN THIS

[Captioner] 20:22:32
 CURRENT
GENERATION MANY PEOPLE THAT WE
KNOW LIKE SOME OF OUR COMMUNITY


[Captioner] 20:22:35
HEROS HAVE THEMSELVES BEEN
INTERRED, AND

[Captioner] 20:22:38
 SO I ABSOLUTELY AM
SUPPORTIVE OF LOOKING AT THAT.


[Captioner] 20:22:42
WE'VE HAD THE PRIDE FLAG

[Captioner] 20:22:46
 AND
ALSO FACT WE HAVE A SCHOOL FOR
THE DEAF AND A SCHOOL FOR

[Captioner] 20:22:49
 THE
BLIND, SO I THINK THAT IN
REPRESENTATION, WE WANT TO MAKE


[Captioner] 20:22:52
SURE, AND WE JUST -- I THINK
COUNCILMEMBER SHAO JUST
MENTIONED

[Captioner] 20:22:56
 THIS IS, I

[Captioner] 20:23:00
 GUESS --
FOR ALL CELEBRATING HANUKKAH TOO
AND ABSOLUTELY TO

[Captioner] 20:23:03
 THIS DAY,
PEOPLE FEEL THE FEELINGS OF
ANTISEMITISM, AND I THINK THAT


[Captioner] 20:23:06
IT IS VERY TIME LEGAL THAT WE
ACCEPT THIS AND THAT WE TALK


[Captioner] 20:23:10
ABOUT A FLAG POLICY TO LOOK AT
HOW WE

[Captioner] 20:23:13
 MIRROR OR LOOK AT THE
REFLECTION OF OTHER CITIES AS A


[Captioner] 20:23:17
WELCOMING COMPASSIONATE CITY
THAT WE MUST INCLUDE

[Captioner] 20:23:20
 DIVERSITY,
EQUITY, INCLUSION, AND I THANK
COUNCILMEMBER SHAO FOR BRINGING


[Captioner] 20:23:23
UP THIS DISCUSSION BECAUSE I
THINK

[Captioner] 20:23:26
 IT'S TIMELY FOR OUR
RETREAT TOO, BECAUSE WHILE

[Captioner] 20:23:29
 WE
SEE AN INCREDIBLE MOVEMENT IN
REFLECTION

[Captioner] 20:23:32
 OF DIVERSITY, EQUITY,
INCLUSION, ON THE

[Captioner] 20:23:35
 COUNCIL, THAT
IS NOT NECESSARILY REFLECTIVE OF
EVERYWHERE.


[Captioner] 20:23:39
AND SO WE WOULD WANT TO MAKE
SURE THAT WE ARE

[Captioner] 20:23:42
 THOUGHTFUL IN
ALL THOSE PROCESSES TO ENSURE

[Captioner] 20:23:46
 WE
HAVE GOOD REPRESENTATION IN ALL
LEVELS OF

[Captioner] 20:23:49
 REPRESENTATION WITHIN
OUR GOVERNMENT.
SO

[Captioner] 20:23:52
 I THINK WITH THAT, I'M HAPPY
TO SUPPORT THIS.


[Captioner] 20:23:56
I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S A
SUBSTITUTE ACCEPTANCE TO THE


[Captioner] 20:23:59
SUBSTITUTE MOTION, I DIDN'T HEAR
ANYONE SECOND

[Captioner] 20:24:03
 THE SUBSTITUTE
OTHER THAN

[Captioner] 20:24:07
 YOU MADE A SECOND
SUBSTITUTE.


[Captioner] 20:24:10
>> Councilmember Campbell: CAN
WE RESTATE THE SUBSTITUTE
MOTION, PLEASE?


[Captioner] 20:24:13
>> Mayor Mei: SURE.
I THINK IT WAS --
>> Councilmember Cox: 

[Captioner] 20:24:15
THE
SUBSTITUTE MOTION IS THAT WE
ACCEPT THE COUNCIL REFERRAL AS


[Captioner] 20:24:21
IS, AND ADD FOLLOW-UP ACTION

[Captioner] 20:24:24
 TO
ADDRESS ESTABLISHING A FLAG
POLICY.


[Captioner] 20:24:27
DID I CAPTURE THAT RIGHT,
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN?


[Captioner] 20:24:31
>> Councilmember Salwan: YES.
>> Councilmember Campbell: OKAY.


[Captioner] 20:24:34
>> City Mgr. Shackelford: LET ME
SAY THIS, I WANT TO BE PERFECTLY
CLEAR ABOUT ESTABLISHING THIS


[Captioner] 20:24:37
POLICY.
STAFF CAN COME BACK WITH
RECOMMENDATIONS ON

[Captioner] 20:24:41
 A POLICY FOR
YOU ALL TO AGREE ON, BUT

[Captioner] 20:24:43
 WE
WOULDN'T BE ESTABLISHING THE
POLICY.


[Captioner] 20:24:47
SO YOU MIGHT WANT TO RESTATE
THAT.


[Captioner] 20:24:50
>> Councilmember Cox: SO THE
CITY STAFF WOULD COME BACK.
>> City Mgr. Shackelford: CITY


[Captioner] 20:24:52
STAFF WILL COME BACK WITH
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR YOU TO
CONSIDER.


[Captioner] 20:24:56
>> Councilmember Cox: I THINK
THAT'S WHAT I MEANT BUT SORE EYE
I'LL MAKE SURE IT'S PERFECTLY


[Captioner] 20:24:57
WORDED CORRECTLY.
>> City Mgr. Shackelford: THANK
YOU.


[Captioner] 20:25:01
>> Councilmember Cox: THANK YOU
FOR THE SUGGESTION.
AND THE

[Captioner] 20:25:04
 COUNCIL REFERRAL TONIGHT
IS ACCEPTED AS

[Captioner] 20:25:07
 IS FOR A FLAG
RAISING CEREMONY IN HONOR OF
BLACK HISTORY MONTH

[Captioner] 20:25:11
 STARTING IN
FEBRUARY 2023,

[Captioner] 20:25:14
 AND THAT IN
ADDITION, WE WILL HAVE A


[Captioner] 20:25:18
FOLLOW-UP ACTION THAT CITY STAFF


[Captioner] 20:25:21
WILL MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS OR
POLICY FOR FLAG

[Captioner] 20:25:24
 RAISING
CEREMONIES GOING FORWARD.


[Captioner] 20:25:29
>> Mayor Mei: AND THAT WOULD BE


[Captioner] 20:25:32
EQUITABLY --
>> Councilmember Cox: IN SPIRIT
OF DIVERSITY, EQUITY AND


[Captioner] 20:25:34
INCLUSION.
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: THROUGH
THE CHAIR POINT OF ORDER.


[Captioner] 20:25:38
SINCE THERE'S A CHANGE TO THE
MOTION, WE SHOULD GO BACK TO
COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL

[Captioner] 20:25:41
 AND ASK
HER IF SHE'S ACCEPTABLE AS A
SECOND.


[Captioner] 20:25:44
>> Councilmember Campbell: I AM
ACCEPTABLE OF THE SECOND.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:25:47
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
I HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND.
CAN I HAVE A ROLL CALL VOTE,
