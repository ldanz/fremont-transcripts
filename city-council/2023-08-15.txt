[Captioner] 19:03:59
>> Mayor Mei: WELCOME, VIRGINIA.


[Captioner] 19:04:02
>> HELLO.
YES, AM

[Captioner] 19:04:05
 I READY TO GO?
>> Mayor Mei: YES, MA'AM.


[Captioner] 19:04:09
>> OKAY, THANK YOU.
HELLO, MAYOR AND

[Captioner] 19:04:12
 COUNCILMEMBERS.
I'M HERE TO SPEAK ABOUT THE SLOW 

[Captioner] 19:04:15
PROGRESS FOR THE OPENING OF MORE FREE

[Captioner] 19:04:18
 PICKLEBALL COURTS AND THE NEED FOR MORE FREE EVENING DROP-IN PLAY.


[Captioner] 19:04:22
I'M VERY EMBARRASSED AS A FREMONT RESIDENT

[Captioner] 19:04:25
 BY THE COURTS OUR CITY PROVIDES.
THE CURRENT FREE COURTS

[Captioner] 19:04:28
 HAVE NETS THAT AREN'T REGULATION SIZE.


[Captioner] 19:04:32
THE NETS ARE TOO HIGH AND WIDE.
THEY'RE STRAPPED

[Captioner] 19:04:35
 DOWN, TRYING TO ACHIEVE THE PROPER HEIGHT, BUT

[Captioner] 19:04:38
 ALREADY, ANCHOR BOLTS HAVE COME OUT, NOT KEEPING NETS IN PLACE.


[Captioner] 19:04:42
I HAVE NOT SEEN ANY OTHER CITY'S

[Captioner] 19:04:45
 COURTS THAT AREN'T TO REGULATION.
THE COURTS ARE EITHER

[Captioner] 19:04:49
 DEDICATED OR WITH PORTABLE NETS.
I FEEL THE CITY

[Captioner] 19:04:52
 SHOWS DISRESPECT TO PICKLEBALL PLAYERS BY THE CONDITION OF

[Captioner] 19:04:55
 THE FREE COURTS THAT ARE OFFERED.
I KNOW

[Captioner] 19:04:59
 COURT ARE PLANNED FOR

[Captioner] 19:05:02
 THE NEW LOCATION BUT IT SEEMS LITTLE HAS

[Captioner] 19:05:05
 BEEN DONE TO MOVE THAT PROJECT ALONG.
MILIPITAS

[Captioner] 19:05:10
 -- STARTED PILOT PROGRAMS AROUND THE

[Captioner] 19:05:13
 SAME TIME LONG AGO.
NOW THEY HAVE SIX PRIORITY

[Captioner] 19:05:17
 AND TWO DEDICATED COURTS RUNNING SEVEN DAYS A

[Captioner] 19:05:20
 WEEK FROM 7:00 A.M. TO 10:00 P.M., AND ALL

[Captioner] 19:05:23
 FOR FREE.
WHAT DID FREMONT GET IN THAT

[Captioner] 19:05:26
 TIME?
FOUR COURTS THAT YOU HAVE TO

[Captioner] 19:05:29
 PAY TO PLAY ON.


[Captioner] 19:05:32
THOSE FOUR COURTS --

[Captioner] 19:05:36
 VERY QUICKLY, IN FACT SURPRISINGLY SO, BUT IN FACT, THERE WAS

[Captioner] 19:05:39
 REVENUE TO BE MADE SO IT SEEMS THAT THERE WAS -- THAT WAS THE REASON FOR

[Captioner] 19:05:41
 SUCH SPEED IN BRINGING THEM TO EXISTENCE.


[Captioner] 19:05:46
FREMONT RECREATION OFFERS PICKLEBALL LESSONS, GENERATING A

[Captioner] 19:05:49
 LOT OF NEW PLAYERS.
UNFORTUNATELY, THERE ISN'T ENOUGH

[Captioner] 19:05:51
 COURT TIME TO ACCOMMODATE ALL PLAYERS.


[Captioner] 19:05:55
WHAT WE NEED IS MORE ACCESS TO COURTS

[Captioner] 19:05:58
 NOW.
THE SITUATION CAN BE HELPED BY 

[Captioner] 19:06:01
ALLOWING FOR FREE PLAY SEVEN DAYS AND EVENINGS

[Captioner] 19:06:04
 A WEEK, EXCEPT DURING LESSONS.


[Captioner] 19:06:07
WE NEED MORE FREE COURT TIME NOW, AS

[Captioner] 19:06:10
 THE PICKLEBALL COURTS AT THE TENNIS CENTER ARE THE

[Captioner] 19:06:13
 ONLY COURTS WE HAVE IN TOWN.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:06:20
>> Ms. Gauthier: THE NEXT SPEAKER IS GUY MOY.


[Captioner] 19:06:29
>> Mayor Mei: WELCOME.
>> MY

[Captioner] 19:06:32
 NAME IS GUY MOY.
I WANT TO LET THE CITY COUNCIL AND 

[Captioner] 19:06:35
MAYOR KNOW THAT FOR THE FASTEST GROWING SPORT IN THE COUNTRY, FREMONT IS THE

[Captioner] 19:06:39
 SLOWEST CITY IN THE BAY AREA TO MAKE PICKLE BALL A REALITY.


[Captioner] 19:06:44
HAYWARD, MILIPITAS, SUNNYVALE AND THE LIST GOES ON,

[Captioner] 19:06:47
 HAVE ALL PROVIDED FREE OUTDOOR

[Captioner] 19:06:49
 PICKLEBALL COURTS TO THEIR COMMUNITIES.


[Captioner] 19:06:53
WHY DOES IT TAKE SO LONG FOR A SIMPLE VISION TO

[Captioner] 19:06:56
 BECOME A REALITY IN OUR CITY?
THE CITY

[Captioner] 19:06:59
 USES MODIFIED JUNIOR TENNIS COURTS AT FTC

[Captioner] 19:07:02
 FOR PICKLEBALL.
IN THE EVENINGS, THESE THREE COURTS 

[Captioner] 19:07:05
ARE WAY OVERCROWDED, WITH WAIT TIMES CLOSE TO AN HOUR

[Captioner] 19:07:08
 FOR A 12-MINUTE GAME.
IT ISN'T ONLY

[Captioner] 19:07:12
 A SENIOR SPORT ANYMORE, AS WE ARE NOW SEEING FAMILIES AND ADULTS

[Captioner] 19:07:15
 COMING OUT IN THE EVENINGS.
IN MAY, WE SUBMITTED

[Captioner] 19:07:18
 A REQUEST TO THE CITY TO EXPAND THE FREE

[Captioner] 19:07:21
 EVENING DROP-INS THAT ARE OFFERED ON TUESDAY AND THURSDAY NIGHTS.


[Captioner] 19:07:25
BY ADDING MONDAY, WEDNESDAY, FRIDAY, SATURDAY AND SUNDAY

[Captioner] 19:07:29
 EVENINGS, THIS WOULD HELP EASE THE OVERCROWDING AND WAIT

[Captioner] 19:07:32
 TIMES.
THIS WOULD BE A TEMPORARY FIX UNTIL WE 

[Captioner] 19:07:35
ARE DIRECTED TO ANOTHER TEMPORARY LOCATION PLANNED FOR US.


[Captioner] 19:07:39
THE CITY'S ANSWER TO OUR REQUEST WAS THAT PLAYERS

[Captioner] 19:07:43
 CAN PLAY ON THE NEW PAY COURT.


[Captioner] 19:07:45
IF THERE ARE NO RESERVATIONS ALREADY BOOKED.


[Captioner] 19:07:49
THE PROBLEM IS, ALL ARE BOOKED WELL IN

[Captioner] 19:07:51
 ADVANCE, AND PLAYERS REALLY DON'T WANT TO PAY FOR IT.


[Captioner] 19:07:55
WHY DO THEY NEED TO CHARGE US?
FTC

[Captioner] 19:07:58
 WAS A TEMPORARY FIX BECAUSE THE CITY IS BEHIND IN ITS

[Captioner] 19:08:01
 SERVICE LEVEL FOR PICKLEBALL.
THE PLAYERS HAVE WAITED

[Captioner] 19:08:04
 PATIENTLY FOR TWO MONTHS NOW TO HEAR THE CITY'S

[Captioner] 19:08:07
 POSITION, AND ARE NOW VERY UPSET AND FRUSTRATED.


[Captioner] 19:08:11
TO VOICE OUR FRUSTRATION, WE HAVE A

[Captioner] 19:08:14
 PETITION WITH 146 RESIDENT SUPPORTERS THAT

[Captioner] 19:08:18
 WOULD LIKE THE CITY TO REVERSE THEIR DECISION AND ALLOW

[Captioner] 19:08:21
 ADDITIONAL FREE EVENING DROP-IN PERIODS THAT WOULD HELP EASE

[Captioner] 19:08:25
 THE OVERCROWDING.
IF YOU

[Captioner] 19:08:28
 LIKE MORE INFORMATION THAN TWO MINUTES OF INFORMATION HERE, KIM

[Captioner] 19:08:30
 AND SUZANNE HAVE MY CONTACT INFORMATION.


[Captioner] 19:08:34
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR LISTENING.


[Captioner] 19:08:38
>> Ms. Gauthier: NEXT SPEAKER IS PING CHIN.


[Captioner] 19:08:48
>> GOOD EVENING, MAYOR MEI, VICE MAYOR

[Captioner] 19:08:51
 COX AND CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS.
MY NAME IS PING CHIN.


[Captioner] 19:08:54
I AM FREMONT'S PICKLEBALL AMBASSADOR ADVOCATING

[Captioner] 19:08:57
 THE FASTEST GROWING SPORT IN THE

[Captioner] 19:09:00
 U.S.
INTEREST IN PICKLEBALL HAS GROWN 

[Captioner] 19:09:03
EXPONENTIALLY WITHIN THE LAST YEAR IN FREMONT.


[Captioner] 19:09:06
DESPITE SOME PROGRESS IN PROVIDING PICKLEBALL COURTS, THE

[Captioner] 19:09:09
 PICKLEBALL COMMUNITY STILL FACES MANY CHALLENGES.


[Captioner] 19:09:13
COMPARED TO THE TENNIS COMMUNITY THAT HAS

[Captioner] 19:09:16
 21 COURT THAT HAVE FREE FULL-TIME ACCESS, THERE

[Captioner] 19:09:19
 IS ZERO PICKLEBALL COURT THAT IS FREE FULL TIME.


[Captioner] 19:09:23
THIS IS A GREAT DISPARITY IN SERVICES OFFERED TO

[Captioner] 19:09:25
 THE TENNIS AND PICKLEBALL COMMUNITIES.


[Captioner] 19:09:30
WE HAVE THREE DUAL PURPOSE COURTS WITH PICKLEBALL LINES

[Captioner] 19:09:33
 OVERLAID ON JUNIOR TENNIS COURTS AT FREMONT TENNIS

[Captioner] 19:09:36
 CENTER.
FREMONT ACCESS IS LIMIT TODAY WEEKDAY 

[Captioner] 19:09:39
MORNINGS AND EARLY AFTERNOONS, AND TWO WEEKNIGHTS ON TUESDAYS AND

[Captioner] 19:09:43
 THURSDAYS.
AT TIMES THERE WILL BE

[Captioner] 19:09:46
 OVER 30 PLAYERS SHARING THE THREE  COURTS.


[Captioner] 19:09:49
PADDLES ARE STACKED FOUR TO EIGHT HIGH AT EVERY COURT

[Captioner] 19:09:52
 POST WAITING FOR TURNS.
PLAYERS HAVE TO WAIT 20 TO 30 MINUTES 

[Captioner] 19:09:55
TO PLAY JUST ONE GAME.


[Captioner] 19:09:59
WE HAVE ASKED COMMUNITY SERVICES TO EXTEND THE FREE HOURS

[Captioner] 19:10:03
 TO EVERY EVENING.


[Captioner] 19:10:06
THE ADDITIONAL EVENINGS WOULD SPREAD THE NUMBER OF PLAYERS

[Captioner] 19:10:09
 ON THE COURT EACH NIGHT.
THE HOPE WOULD BE LESS CROWDED

[Captioner] 19:10:12
 CONDITIONS AND LESS WAIT TIME.


[Captioner] 19:10:16
COMMUNITY SERVICES HAS DENIED OUR REQUEST, STATING

[Captioner] 19:10:19
 RE-ASSESSMENT OF COURT USE IS REQUIRED

[Captioner] 19:10:22
.
OUR NEIGHBOR CITY, HAYWARD,

[Captioner] 19:10:25
 WITH 50% OF FREMONT'S POPULATION, HAS EIGHT

[Captioner] 19:10:29
 DEDICATED PICKLEBASKETBALL COURTS THAT ARE FREE AND HAVE PLANS

[Captioner] 19:10:32
 TO BUILD 10 ADDITIONAL PICKLEBALL COURTS.


[Captioner] 19:10:36
MILIPITAS HAS EIGHT PICKLEBALL DUAL PURPOSE COURTS AND ITS

[Captioner] 19:10:38
 MAYOR HAS COMMITTED TO MORE FREE PICKLEBALL COURTS.


[Captioner] 19:10:43
MEANWHILE, FREMONT PLAYERS ARE WAITING FOR

[Captioner] 19:10:46
 FREE FULL-TIME PICKLEBALL COURTS.
WE NEED

[Captioner] 19:10:49
 IMMEDIATE RELIEF TO THE OVERCROWDING SITUATIONS ON

[Captioner] 19:10:52
 TUESDAY AND THURSDAY EVENINGS.
TONIGHT, I

[Captioner] 19:10:56
 ASK THE CITY COUNCIL

[Captioner] 19:10:59
 TO HELP THE PICKLEBALL COMMUNITY

[Captioner] 19:11:02
 TO EXTEND FREE PLAY DURING EVENING HOURS ON

[Captioner] 19:11:06
 THE JUNIOR TENNIS COURTS.
FREMONT TENNIS

[Captioner] 19:11:09
 CENTER IS LESS THAN 10 MINUTES AWAY FROM CITY HALL.


[Captioner] 19:11:12
I ENCOURAGE COUNCILMEMBERS TO

[Captioner] 19:11:17
 VISIT PICKLEBALL PLAYERS

[Captioner] 19:11:20
 ON FREMONT'S JUNIOR TENNIS COURTS TUESDAY AND THURSDAY EVENINGS.


[Captioner] 19:11:23
WE HAVE PEOPLE PLAY UNTIL 10:00 P.M., WHEN THE LIGHTS GO OUT.


[Captioner] 19:11:26
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
>> Ms. Gauthier: THAT'S THE LAST OF 

[Captioner] 19:11:29
THE ZOOM SPEAKERS.


[Captioner] 19:11:33
WE HAVE KELLY ABREU IN-HOUSE.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:11:47
>> SO ONE OF THE ITEMS LATER ON THE AGENDA IS A

[Captioner] 19:11:50
 PROPERTY ACQUISITION,

[Captioner] 19:11:54
 AND IT'S ALWAYS GOOD TO LOOK AT THESE THINGS ON

[Captioner] 19:11:57
 THE OTHER SIDE.
AND

[Captioner] 19:11:59
 THE OPPOSITE OF A PROPERTY ACQUISITION IS A PROPERTY DISPOSITION.


[Captioner] 19:12:04
AND THE OPPOSITE

[Captioner] 19:12:08
 OF DOING

[Captioner] 19:12:12
 IT -- OF, YOU KNOW

[Captioner] 19:12:16
, PAYING MONEY FOR PROPERTY IS TO

[Captioner] 19:12:19
 RECEIVE MONEY IN EXCHANGE FOR

[Captioner] 19:12:22
 A 99-YEAR LEASE.
AND THAT'S WHAT HAPPEN

[Captioner] 19:12:25
ED, JUST TO GIVE YOU A

[Captioner] 19:12:29
 LITTLE PEEK ON THE OTHER SIDE,

[Captioner] 19:12:33
 AT OHLONE COLLEGE, IN NEWARK, THEY OWN SEVERAL ACRES OF

[Captioner] 19:12:36
 LAND, THEY LEASED THEM OUT FOR 99 YEARS AND

[Captioner] 19:12:39
 THEY WERE GOING TO RECEIVE SOME AMOUNT OF MONEY, MAYBE A

[Captioner] 19:12:42
 RANGE, CERTAIN RANGE OF MONEY PER YEAR, IN EXCHANGE FOR

[Captioner] 19:12:46
 AN UNKNOWN NUMBER OF UNITS,

[Captioner] 19:12:49
 UNKNOWN TERMS AND CONDITIONS, UNKNOWN

[Captioner] 19:12:52
 FINANCIAL TERMS.
IN FACT, WHEN THEY

[Captioner] 19:12:55
 PRESENTED TO THEIR BOARD OF

[Captioner] 19:12:59
 TRUSTEES, THEIR PROPERTY DISPOSITION -- THE TERMS

[Captioner] 19:13:02
 AND CONDITIONS WERE COMPLETELY

[Captioner] 19:13:05
 IMPENETRABLE, FOGGY, NO ONE COULD FIGURE OUT WHAT WAS GOING ON.


[Captioner] 19:13:07
EVENTUALLY I FIGURED OUT WHAT WAS GOING ON.


[Captioner] 19:13:10
THEY HAD A CONFIDENTIALITY CLAUSE PUT IN BY THE

[Captioner] 19:13:15
 LAWYERS, AND THE CONFIDENTIALITY CLAUSE SAID THAT NONE OF THESE TERMS 

[Captioner] 19:13:19
CAN BE DISCLOSED UNTIL THE ENTIRE CONTRACT

[Captioner] 19:13:23
 TERMINATES OR FINISHES OR CLOSES OR WHATEVER, UNTIL

[Captioner] 19:13:26
 IT'S IRREVERSIBLE, WHICH MIGHT BE IN A FEW MONTHS OR A FEW WEEKS

[Captioner] 19:13:29
 OR GOD KNOWS WHEN.
SO WHEN

[Captioner] 19:13:32
 YOU LOOK AT YOUR CONTRACTS AND

[Captioner] 19:13:35
 YOU LOOK AT

[Captioner] 19:13:39
 YOUR ACQUISITIONS, THINK ABOUT HOW NOT TO DO A DISPOSITION,

[Captioner] 19:13:42
 WHICH IS IN THE CLOSET, TRYING TO HIDE EVERYTHING, TRYING NOT TO DISCLOSE

[Captioner] 19:13:45
 ANYTHING AND NOT TO TELL ANYONE WHAT'S REALLY GOING

[Captioner] 19:13:47
 ON AND HIDE ALL THE NUMBERS.
THANKS.


[Captioner] 19:13:56
>> Mayor Mei: THAT WAS OUR LAST SPEAKER?


[Captioner] 19:14:01
THANK YOU.
NEXT ON OUR AGENDA ITEM

[Captioner] 19:14:05
 IS ITEM 6A, AND WE HAVE ASSISTANT

[Captioner] 19:14:08
 CITY MANAGER CHRISTINA BRIGGS AND ECONOMIC

[Captioner] 19:14:12
 DEVELOPMENT DIRECTOR DONOVAN LAZARO WHO

[Captioner] 19:14:15
 WILL PRESENT

[Captioner] 19:14:18
 AN INTRODUCTION.


[Captioner] 19:14:31
>> GOOD EVENING, MAYOR AND CITY COUNCILMEMBERS.


[Captioner] 19:14:35
I'M CHRISTINA BRIGGS, ASSISTANT CITY MANAGER, JOINED BY OUR ECONOMIC

[Captioner] 19:14:39
 DEVELOPMENT DIRECTOR, DONOVAN LAZARO.
PLEASED TO BE WITH YOU THIS EVENING

[Captioner] 19:14:42
 AND THANK YOU FOR TAKING TIME DURING YOUR AUGUST RECESS FOR THIS

[Captioner] 19:14:44
 SPECIAL MEETING.
THE ITEM WE HAVE FOR YOUR 

[Captioner] 19:14:47
CONSIDERATION TONIGHT IS TIME-SENSITIVE IN NATURE AND REPRESENTS A

[Captioner] 19:14:50
 STRATEGIC OPPORTUNITY FOR THE CITY TO ADVANCE SEVERAL

[Captioner] 19:14:53
 LONG-TERM GOALS WHILE ENHANCING THE VALUE OF ITS OWN REAL

[Captioner] 19:14:56
 PROPERTY ASSETS.
ON

[Captioner] 19:14:59
 JULY 11TH, YOU, THE CITY COUNCIL, DIRECTED STAFF TO ENGAGE IN 

[Captioner] 19:15:03
NEGOTIATIONS TO ACQUIRE THE OFFICE PROPERTY LOCATED

[Captioner] 19:15:06
 AT 39180 LIBERTY STREET, AND WE ARE

[Captioner] 19:15:09
 PLEASED TO SHARE THAT WE HAVE REACHED AGREEMENT ON

[Captioner] 19:15:12
 TERMS OF A PURCHASE AGREEMENT WITH THAT OWNERSHIP GROUP AND TONIGHT

[Captioner] 19:15:14
 SEEK YOUR APPROVAL TO EXECUTE THE AGREEMENT.


[Captioner] 19:15:19
AS YOU'RE AWARE, THE SUBJECT PROPERTY ALONG WITH THE EXISTING

[Captioner] 19:15:22
 CITY HALL SITE FALL WITHIN THE DOWNTOWN COMMUNITY PLAN AREA,

[Captioner] 19:15:25
 WHICH WAS ADOPTED BY THE CITY COUNCIL IN OCTOBER

[Captioner] 19:15:28
 OF 2012.
THIS PLAN ENVISIONS A WALKABLE AND

[Captioner] 19:15:32
 VIBRANT MIXED USE DESTINATION FOR THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY

[Captioner] 19:15:35
 WITH CAPITOL AVENUE SERVING AS THAT PRIMARY

[Captioner] 19:15:38
 RETAIL SPINE.
SINCE THE ADOPTION OF THE DOWNTOWN 

[Captioner] 19:15:42
COMMUNITY PLAN, DOWNTOWN HAS SEEN SIGNIFICANT PRIVATE SECTOR

[Captioner] 19:15:45
 INVESTMENT IN THE CITY'S LONG TERM VISION IS REALLY BEGINNING TO TAKE

[Captioner] 19:15:46
 SHAPE.
IT EXCITING.


[Captioner] 19:15:50
TODAY SEVERAL MAJOR PROJECTS HAVE BEEN COMPLETED, ARE

[Captioner] 19:15:53
 UNDER CONSTRUCTION OR APPROVED, AND AN INCREASING NUMBER OF

[Captioner] 19:15:55
 NEW SMALL BUSINESSES AND RESIDENTS ARE CALLING DOWNTOWN HOME.


[Captioner] 19:16:00
THE CIVIC CENTER MASTER PLAN WAS SUBSEQUENTLY APPROVED BY

[Captioner] 19:16:03
 THE COUNCIL IN JULY OF 2014, AND IS CONSIDERED A

[Captioner] 19:16:06
 KEY COMPONENT TO REALIZING THAT LONG TERM VISION

[Captioner] 19:16:09
 IN DOWNTOWN.
IT PROVIDES A FRAMEWORK FOR STEERING

[Captioner] 19:16:12
 MULTIPLE PHASES OF REDEVELOPMENT OF THE PROPERTIES

[Captioner] 19:16:15
 DOWNTOWN -- OF THE CITY'S DOWNTOWN PROPERTIES, ULTIMATELY

[Captioner] 19:16:19
 CONTEMPLATING A MULTI-STORY MODERNIZED CITY HALL WITH EXPANDED

[Captioner] 19:16:22
 COUNCIL CHAMBERS, A NEW HOME FOR THE FRC,

[Captioner] 19:16:25
 POTENTIALLY A PARKING GARAGE TO SUPPORT EXPANDED DOWNTOWN COMMERCIAL

[Captioner] 19:16:29
 ACTIVITY, AND OF COURSE OUR DOWNTOWN EVENT CENTER, WHICH HAS

[Captioner] 19:16:33
 ALREADY BEEN DEVELOPED.
THE CIVIC CENTER MASTER

[Captioner] 19:16:36
 PLAN ALSO CALLS FOR THE OPTIMIZED

[Captioner] 19:16:39
 CONSOLIDATION OF MUCH OF THE CITY'S ADMINISTRATIVE OPERATIONS INTO A 

[Captioner] 19:16:43
SINGLE FACILITY, ULTIMATELY FREEING UP THE CITY'S EXCESS

[Captioner] 19:16:46
 PROPERTIES FOR REDEVELOPMENT THAT SUPPORT THE DOWNTOWN VISION.


[Captioner] 19:16:49
IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE OFFICE BUILDING ON THIS PROPERTY THAT

[Captioner] 19:16:52
 WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TONIGHT WOULD ASSIST THE CITY IN ITS

[Captioner] 19:16:56
 ABILITY TO TEMPORARILY RELOCATE PART OF ITS OWN

[Captioner] 19:17:00
 OPERATIONS IF OR WHILE A NEW CIVIC CENTER IS DEVELOPED

[Captioner] 19:17:02
 ON SOME PORTION OF ONE OF THE CITY'S DOWNTOWN PROPERTIES.


[Captioner] 19:17:07
AND POTENTIAL REDEVELOPMENT OF THE CITY'S EXCESS PROPERTIES,

[Captioner] 19:17:10
 BOTH INCREASE THE VALUE OF CITY ASSETS AND WOULD MAKE A

[Captioner] 19:17:14
 MAJOR CONTRIBUTION TO FREMONT'S REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS

[Captioner] 19:17:17
 ASSESSMENT ALLOCATION WHILE ADDING ADDITIONAL

[Captioner] 19:17:19
 COMMERCIAL AND COMMUNITY SERVING SPACE TO DOWNTOWN.


[Captioner] 19:17:23
NOW I'LL TURN TO

[Captioner] 19:17:26
 DONOVAN, WHO'S GOING TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THE PROPERTY IN MORE DETAIL AND 

[Captioner] 19:17:29
THE HIGH LEVEL TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT.
>> THANK YOU, CHRISTINA.


[Captioner] 19:17:32
GOOD EVENING, COUNCIL.
OVER THE LAST SEVERAL WEEKS, STAFF

[Captioner] 19:17:36
 HAVE MADE CONSIDERABLE EFFORTS TO COME TO AGREED TERMS ON THE SUBJECT

[Captioner] 19:17:38
 PROPERTY.
WITH INPUT FROM SEVERAL CITY 

[Captioner] 19:17:42
DEPARTMENTS AND ORGANIZATIONAL FUNCTIONS WHO ARE AVAILABLE TO ANSWER 

[Captioner] 19:17:45
QUESTIONS AS NEEDED.
WE ALSO

[Captioner] 19:17:48
 HAVE LANDIS GRADEN, THE CITY'S REAL

[Captioner] 19:17:50
 ESTATE BROKERAGE CONSULTANT, ON THIS TRANSACTION.


[Captioner] 19:17:54
THE PURCHASE OF THE PROPERTY AT

[Captioner] 19:17:59
 39180 LIBERTY WOULD ALLOW THE CITY TO EXPAND ITS REAL PROPERTY HOLDINGS

[Captioner] 19:18:00
 IMMEDIATELY ADJACENT TO THE CURRENT CITY HALL.


[Captioner] 19:18:04
THE PROPERTY IS ROUGHLY 1.23 ACRES WITH

[Captioner] 19:18:07
 AN APPROXIMATELY 23,000 SQUARE

[Captioner] 19:18:10
 FOOT TWO-STORY OFFICE.
THE BUILDING REMAINS OCCUPIED

[Captioner] 19:18:14
 BY SEVERAL COMMERCIAL TENANTS FOR WHICH STAFF WILL REVIEW THE LEASES

[Captioner] 19:18:17
 AND OBTAIN ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE EXISTING TENANTS

[Captioner] 19:18:20
 DURING THE DUE DILIGENCE PROCESS.


[Captioner] 19:18:24
AS NOTED IN THE STAFF REPORT, THE ACQUISITION OF THE LIBERTY

[Captioner] 19:18:27
 PROPERTY IS OPPORTUNISTIC IN NATURE.
PURCHASING THE

[Captioner] 19:18:30
 SITE WOULD ALLOW FOR THE CITY TO EXTRA TEEJ

[Captioner] 19:18:33
 CLEE CONSOLIDATITY ADMINISTRATIVE OPERATIONS WITHIN THE CURRENT

[Captioner] 19:18:36
 CITY HALL AREA WHILE ADDING A KEY PARCEL THAT WOULD ENHANCE

[Captioner] 19:18:40
 THE OVERALL REDEVELOPMENT VIABILITY OF THE CITY'S EXISTING

[Captioner] 19:18:43
 PROPERTIES.
WITH THE POSSIBILITY

[Captioner] 19:18:46
 OF INCREASING OUR UNDERLYING LAND VALUES WITH THIS

[Captioner] 19:18:49
 ADDITION.
POTENTIAL SHORT TERM AND

[Captioner] 19:18:52
 MEDIAN TERM USES FOR THE BUILDING WOULD BE BASED

[Captioner] 19:18:55
 ON THE CITY'S OPERATIONAL NEED AND COULD INCLUDE THE RELOCATION OF ONE

[Captioner] 19:18:58
 OR MORE CITY DEPARTMENTS TO PORTIONS OF THE BUILDING AS

[Captioner] 19:19:02
 SPACES BECOME AVAILABLE.


[Captioner] 19:19:05
HOWEVER, IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE EXECUTION OF THE PURCHASE

[Captioner] 19:19:08
 AGREEMENT AND ALLOCATION OF FUNDS, WHICH ARE THE

[Captioner] 19:19:11
 SOLE ITEMS BEFORE YOU THIS EVENING, DO NOT NECESSITATE

[Captioner] 19:19:14
 ANY CHANGES TO THE BUILDING, THE CURRENT OFFICE USES OF THE

[Captioner] 19:19:17
 PROPERTY, OR THE LEASE TERMS OF THE EXISTING COMMERCIAL TENANTS.


[Captioner] 19:19:23
THE AGREED UPON PURCHASE PRICE OF

[Captioner] 19:19:26
 6.54 MILLION REFLECTS UNDERLYING LAND VALUE FOR A FUTURE

[Captioner] 19:19:30
 HIGHER AND BETTER USE OF MULTIFAMILY REDEVELOPMENT OF THE

[Captioner] 19:19:33
 SITE.
IT FALLS WITHIN A RANGE OF

[Captioner] 19:19:36
 PROPERTY VALUATION COMPARISONS PROVIDED BY DCG.


[Captioner] 19:19:39
AS NOTED IN THE STAFF REPORT, THE RECOMMENDED

[Captioner] 19:19:42
 BUDGET ACTION WOULD REALLOCATE A TOTAL OF

[Captioner] 19:19:46
 $6.75 MILLION FROM THE STRATEGIC INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES RESERVE, 

[Captioner] 19:19:49
WHICH WOULD PROVIDE ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO COVER PURCHASE-RELATED COSTS

[Captioner] 19:19:53
 THAT MAY ARISE.


[Captioner] 19:19:59
EXCUSE ME ONE SECOND.


[Captioner] 19:20:05
THE TERMS OF THE PURCHASE AGREEMENT PROVIDE THE CITY A

[Captioner] 19:20:09
 30-DAY DUE DILIGENCE PERIOD UPON EXECUTION THAT MAY BE

[Captioner] 19:20:12
 EXTENDED BY 15 DAYS IF THERE IS AN IDENTIFIED

[Captioner] 19:20:16
 ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITION REQUIRING FURTHER INVESTIGATION OR A

[Captioner] 19:20:17
 MAJOR DEFECT DISCOVERED WITHIN THE BUILDING.


[Captioner] 19:20:22
FOLLOWING THE EXECUTION OF THE PURCHASE AGREEMENT, THE CITY

[Captioner] 19:20:25
 WOULD OBTAIN THIRD PARTY SERVICES TO INSPECT THE CONDITION OF

[Captioner] 19:20:28
 THE BUILDING AND PROPERTY AND PERFORM A PHASE ONE

[Captioner] 19:20:32
 ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS IN ADDITION TO INSPECTIONS PERFORMED BY THE CITY'S

[Captioner] 19:20:36
 IN-HOUSE BUILDING AND FIRE INSPECTORS, AS WELL AS FACILITY STAFF.


[Captioner] 19:20:39
AND NOW I WILL TURN IT BACK OVER TO CHRISTINA.


[Captioner] 19:20:43
>> THANK YOU, DONOVAN.
SO IN CLOSING,

[Captioner] 19:20:46
 I DO WANT TO NOTE THAT THIS

[Captioner] 19:20:49
 EVENING STAFF DID POST WHAT WE CALL A GREEN SHEET TO

[Captioner] 19:20:52
 REFLECT EDITS TO THE ADDENDUM THAT DID NOT CHANGE THE

[Captioner] 19:20:56
 BUSINESS TERMS PRESENTED TO YOU.


[Captioner] 19:20:59
I'LL DEFER TO THE CITY ATTORNEY IF YOU WANT TO DISCUSS THAT AT ALL.


[Captioner] 19:21:04
>> THAT'S ACCURATE.
WITHIN THE GREEN SHEET

[Captioner] 19:21:08
 ATTACHMENTS IS THE PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT THAT HAS

[Captioner] 19:21:11
 THE ADDED RED LINES THAT REFLECT THE

[Captioner] 19:21:14
 CHANGES THAT STAFF IS RECOMMENDING THE COUNCIL ADOPT THIS

[Captioner] 19:21:17
 EVENING AS PART OF THE PACKAGE OF APPROVALS.


[Captioner] 19:21:21
THIS DOES INCLUDE SOME TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS

[Captioner] 19:21:24
 TO THE ADDENDUM, INCLUDING, FOR EXAMPLE,

[Captioner] 19:21:28
 PROVIDING THE SELLER THE RIGHT TO APPROVE A SCOPE OF

[Captioner] 19:21:31
 WORK IF PHASE TWO TESTING IS REQUIRED ON THE SITE WOULD

[Captioner] 19:21:35
 BE ONE EXAMPLE.
THE CITY ALSO REQUESTED

[Captioner] 19:21:38
 ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES WITH RESPECT TO

[Captioner] 19:21:41
 RENT ROLLS DURING THE DUE DILIGENCE

[Captioner] 19:21:44
 PERIOD.
THE CITY AGREED TO DROP AN

[Captioner] 19:21:47
 INDEMNIFICATION REQUIREMENT THAT WAS INCLUDED WITHIN THE ORIGINAL ADDENDUM 

[Captioner] 19:21:51
SENT TO THE SELLER.
SO THESE, AGAIN, AS MENTIONED

[Captioner] 19:21:54
 BY ASSISTANT CITY MANAGER

[Captioner] 19:21:57
 REALLY REFLECT MORE TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF THE TRANSACTION AND

[Captioner] 19:22:00
 THE BUSINESS TERMS REMAIN LARGELY THE SAME.


[Captioner] 19:22:03
THANK YOU.
>> SO STAFF

[Captioner] 19:22:05
 HAVE TWO RECOMMENDATIONS FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION.


[Captioner] 19:22:10
THE FIRST IS AS ALREADY WAS MENTIONED, IS TO ADOPT A RESOLUTION

[Captioner] 19:22:13
 APPROVING AND AUTHORIZING THE CITY MANAGER TO EXECUTE THE REVISED 

[Captioner] 19:22:16
PURCHASE AGREEMENT AND ADDENDUM, INCLUDED WITH YOUR STAFF REPORT AND

[Captioner] 19:22:19
 UPDATED GREEN SHEET.
AND FIND THAT THE PROPOSED PURCHASE IS 

[Captioner] 19:22:22
EXEMPT FROM CEQA.
AND THE SECOND IS TO

[Captioner] 19:22:26
 REALLOCATE $6,750,000 FROM THE STRATEGIC INVESTMENT

[Captioner] 19:22:30
 OPPORTUNITIES RESERVE IN THE CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS FUND TO FUND

[Captioner] 19:22:32
 THE ACQUISITION.
AND WITH THAT, WE AND OTHER STAFF ARE 

[Captioner] 19:22:35
AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS.


[Captioner] 19:22:41
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
AT THIS TIME, IS THERE ANY

[Captioner] 19:22:43
 QUESTIONS FROM THE COUNCIL?
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN.


[Captioner] 19:22:48
>> Councilmember Salwan: THANK YOU FOR THE WONDERFUL PRESENTATION AND

[Captioner] 19:22:50
 BRINGING US TOGETHER FOR THIS IMPORTANT ITEM.


[Captioner] 19:22:54
I DO RECALL WE APPROVED THIS, I THINK IT

[Captioner] 19:22:57
 WAS 2014, OUR CIVIC MASTER PLAN.


[Captioner] 19:23:00
SO I DON'T REMEMBER, THIS PROPERTY WAS NOT

[Captioner] 19:23:04
 CONTEMPLATED AT THAT TIME.


[Captioner] 19:23:07
HOW WILL THIS TIE INTO OUR LARGER MASTER PLAN?


[Captioner] 19:23:10
I KNOW WE HAD A LOT OF GREAT IDEAS, SOME OF

[Captioner] 19:23:13
 THEM GOT SHELVED, SO HOW CAN WE DIRECT SOME OF

[Captioner] 19:23:15
 THAT?
>> THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.


[Captioner] 19:23:18
FUNDAMENTALLY, WHAT THIS PROPERTY DOES, IN ADDITION TO EXPANDING THE CURRENT 

[Captioner] 19:23:21
CITY HALL SITE, THEREFORE MAKING IT A MORE VALUABLE PROPERTY

[Captioner] 19:23:25
 THAT THE CITY COULD CONVEY AT A FUTURE DATE FOR OTHER TYPE OF DEVELOPMENT TO

[Captioner] 19:23:28
 SUPPORT DOWNTOWN, THE EXISTING OFFICE BUILDING

[Captioner] 19:23:31
 ASSET ON THE PROPERTY DOES HELP SOLVE WHAT

[Captioner] 19:23:35
 WAS -- HAS PROVEN TO BE A BIT OF A CHALLENGE IN PREVIOUS

[Captioner] 19:23:38
 MASTER PLANNING EFFORTS WITH RESPECT TO THE CIVIC CENTER, BECAUSE IT 

[Captioner] 19:23:41
PROVIDES ADDITIONAL OFFICE CAPACITY FOR US TO WHAT I CALL, YOU

[Captioner] 19:23:45
 KNOW, SHUFFLE THE PUZZLE PIECES OF THE CITY'S OPERATIONS, WHETHER

[Captioner] 19:23:48
 IT'S, YOU KNOW, ON THESE TWO BUILDINGS WHERE WE ARE TODAY, THE

[Captioner] 19:23:52
 DEVELOPMENT SERVICES CENTER DOWN FURTHER ON LIBERTY OR, YOU KNOW, OUR

[Captioner] 19:23:53
 FAMILY RESOURCE CENTER ACROSS THE STREET.


[Captioner] 19:23:58
AND FINDING WAYS TO ACCOMMODATE THOSE

[Captioner] 19:24:01
 USES WHILE A PROPERTY MAY BE TIED UP FOR OTHER TYPE OF

[Captioner] 19:24:05
 DEVELOPMENT RELATED TO THE CIVIC CENTER IS IMPORTANT IN ANY

[Captioner] 19:24:08
 EFFORT WE CONCEIVE OF GOING FORWARD.
>> Councilmember

[Captioner] 19:24:11
 Salwan: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:24:13
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
NEXT IS COUNCILMEMBER SHAO.


[Captioner] 19:24:17
>> Councilmember Shao: THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR.


[Captioner] 19:24:21
I UNDERSTAND THAT UPON

[Captioner] 19:24:24
 EXECUTING THIS AGREEMENT, WE WILL EMBARK ON THE

[Captioner] 19:24:27
 DUE DILIGENCE, ESPECIALLY IN THE

[Captioner] 19:24:30
 AREA OF THE CURRENT TENANTS

[Captioner] 19:24:34
' LEASES.
SO

[Captioner] 19:24:38
 MY -- I'M NOT GOING TO ASK ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THE CURRENT LEASES 

[Captioner] 19:24:41
BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE INFORMATION AND I CERTAINLY HOPE THAT WE DON'T 

[Captioner] 19:24:44
HAVE A 99-YEAR-OLD LEASE FOR ANY OF THAT.


[Captioner] 19:24:48
SO I JUST WONDER

[Captioner] 19:24:51
 IF, AFTER THIS 30-DAY OR EVEN

[Captioner] 19:24:54
 POTENTIALLY 45-DAY DUE DILIGENCE, THE CITY COUNCIL

[Captioner] 19:24:57
 WILL GET SOME

[Captioner] 19:25:01
 REPORT FROM THE DUE DILIGENCE, ESPECIALLY

[Captioner] 19:25:05
 FROM MY PERSPECTIVE, THE AVAILABILITY

[Captioner] 19:25:09
 OF THAT

[Captioner] 19:25:12
 SPACE UPON ACQUISITION, AS WELL

[Captioner] 19:25:16
 AS POTENTIAL RENTAL INCOME IF WE ARE STILL

[Captioner] 19:25:19
 GOING TO HONOR THE EXISTING LEASES

[Captioner] 19:25:22
 TO THE CURRENT TENANTS.
I JUST WANT

[Captioner] 19:25:25
 TO SEE THE WHOLE PICTURE.
THAT

[Captioner] 19:25:28
 IS FOR FUTURE, NEAR FUTURE.


[Captioner] 19:25:32
MY QUESTION TONIGHT IS ACTUALLY, SINCE WE'RE

[Captioner] 19:25:35
 GOING TO REALLOCATE THE FUNDS

[Captioner] 19:25:38
 FROM THIS INVESTMENT FUND IN

[Captioner] 19:25:42
 THE CAPITAL INVESTMENT, I JUST

[Captioner] 19:25:45
 WONDER HOW LARGE IS OUR RESERVE

[Captioner] 19:25:49
 IN TOTAL,

[Captioner] 19:25:52
 AND SINCE WE'RE GOING TO ALSO ALLOCATE FUNDS

[Captioner] 19:25:56
 FOR RELATED EXPENSES,

[Captioner] 19:25:59
 DO WE HAVE ENOUGH IN THE RESERVE AND WHAT

[Captioner] 19:26:02
 IS THE MECHANISM FOR FILLING UP THE

[Captioner] 19:26:05
 RESERVE?
>> YES, AND

[Captioner] 19:26:09
 I DO BELIEVE OUR FINANCE DIRECTOR IS ON THE CALL AND

[Captioner] 19:26:11
 CAN EXPLAIN HOW MUCH IS IN THE STRATEGIC INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES 

[Captioner] 19:26:16
FUND.
>> Mr. Persselin: HI, COUNCILMEMBER 

[Captioner] 19:26:16
SHAO.
THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.


[Captioner] 19:26:20
WE HAVE ABOUT $8.8 MILLION CURRENTLY IN

[Captioner] 19:26:23
 THE STRATEGIC INVESTMENT OPERATING --

[Captioner] 19:26:26
 OPERATION -- STRATEGIC INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES

[Captioner] 19:26:30
  RESERVE, AND WE'RE PROPOSING

[Captioner] 19:26:33
 TO REALLOCATE ABOUT

[Captioner] 19:26:35
 $6.75 MILLION TO THIS SPECIFIC PROJECT.


[Captioner] 19:26:38
SO THAT WOULD LEAVE US WITH

[Captioner] 19:26:42
 ROUGHLY $2 MILLION REMAINING IN THAT

[Captioner] 19:26:45
 RESERVE.
AS WE'VE

[Captioner] 19:26:49
 NOTED, A LOT OF WHAT WE'RE DOING RIGHT NOW IS AN

[Captioner] 19:26:52
 ESTIMATE.
WE STILL NEED TO GO THROUGH THE DUE

[Captioner] 19:26:55
 DILIGENCE PERIOD SO WE CAN BETTER UNDERSTAND WHAT SOME OF THE

[Captioner] 19:26:59
 UP-FRONT ACQUISITION COSTS OTHER THAN WHAT THE PURCHASE PRICE MIGHT

[Captioner] 19:27:01
 BE, BUT WE HAVE $8.8 MILLION IN TOTAL.


[Captioner] 19:27:08
>> Councilmember Shao: MY SECOND HALF OF THE QUESTION IS HOW

[Captioner] 19:27:11
 USUALLY DO WE FEEL UP

[Captioner] 19:27:14
 THE RESERVE?
NOW IT'S SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER,

[Captioner] 19:27:17
 AND WHAT'S THE MECHANISM FOR

[Captioner] 19:27:21
 US TO, IN THE FUTURE, PUT MORE MONEY INTO THIS

[Captioner] 19:27:24
 RESERVE?
>> SO

[Captioner] 19:27:27
 THIS PARTICULAR RESERVE WAS ESTABLISHED AS THE CITY WAS

[Captioner] 19:27:30
 COMING OUT OF THE LAST -- THE GREAT RECESSION.


[Captioner] 19:27:35
THE CITY COUNCIL IN 2013, 2014,

[Captioner] 19:27:39
 AND 2016 MADE A DECISION TO SET

[Captioner] 19:27:42
 ASIDE MONEY THAT WAS ESSENTIALLY

[Captioner] 19:27:45
 UNANTICIPATED REVENUE, ONE-TIME

[Captioner] 19:27:49
 MONEY, TO BE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF

[Captioner] 19:27:52
 STRATEGIC OPPORTUNITIES LIKE THIS ONE.


[Captioner] 19:27:55
THEY WERE PROBABLY THINKING NOT JUST ABOUT THE CIVIC CENTER

[Captioner] 19:27:59
 PROJECT, BUT AT THE TIME

[Captioner] 19:28:02
, WE WERE WORKING ON THE

[Captioner] 19:28:05
 INNOVATION DISTRICT, AND SO THAT WAS ANOTHER PLACE WHERE THE COUNCIL

[Captioner] 19:28:08
 WAS THINKING THAT WE MIGHT WANT TO MAKE STRATEGIC INVESTMENT.


[Captioner] 19:28:11
S.
SO THAT WAS THE IDEA.


[Captioner] 19:28:15
WE STOPPED SETTING ASIDE MONEY

[Captioner] 19:28:18
 IN 2016, AND BEGAN USING

[Captioner] 19:28:22
 ONE-TIME MONEY TO ADDRESS OUR

[Captioner] 19:28:25
 CAPITAL NEEDS, AND THE CITY COUNCIL, IF

[Captioner] 19:28:28
 IT CHOSE, COULD SET ASIDE NEW MONEY

[Captioner] 19:28:31
 FOR THE STRATEGIC INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES RESERVE

[Captioner] 19:28:34
, BUT WE DON'T HAVE A REGULAR

[Captioner] 19:28:39
 ALLOCATION TO THAT RESERVE.


[Captioner] 19:28:42
>> Councilmember Shao: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:28:45
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
NEXT IS COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL.


[Captioner] 19:28:50
>> Councilmember Campbell: THANK YOU FOR THAT.


[Captioner] 19:28:54
THAT WAS SIMILAR TO MY QUESTION ABOUT REPLENISHING

[Captioner] 19:28:58
 THAT, AND HOW MUCH WAS THE BALANCE, SO THAT WAS

[Captioner] 19:29:01
 SIMILAR TO IT.
BUT I DID HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION 

[Captioner] 19:29:01
SPECIFICALLY RELATED TO FINANCE AS WELL.


[Captioner] 19:29:06
I SEE ON THE

[Captioner] 19:29:10
 ACTUAL AGREEMENT, PURCHASE AGREEMENT, IT

[Captioner] 19:29:13
 SAYS IT IS

[Captioner] 19:29:16
 FOR 6.54,

[Captioner] 19:29:20
 BUT ON THE REQUEST, IT

[Captioner] 19:29:23
 IS 6.75.
SO THAT'S

[Captioner] 19:29:27
 ABOUT $210,000.


[Captioner] 19:29:30
DIFFERENCE.
AND THEN IN TERMS OF THE ASK, MORE

[Captioner] 19:29:34
 OF WHAT WE'RE PURCHASING IT FOR

[Captioner] 19:29:38
.
IN ADDITION IS

[Captioner] 19:29:42
 $195,000 DEPOSIT, WHICH LEAVES ABOUT

[Captioner] 19:29:46
 $15,000 DANGLING.
CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHAT THOSE DOLLARS ARE 

[Captioner] 19:29:47
FOR, PLEASE?
>> YES.


[Captioner] 19:29:50
I CAN START AND I'M HAPPY FOR DIRECTOR PERSSELIN TO WEIGH IN AS WELL.


[Captioner] 19:29:54
SO THE $195,000 DEPOSIT IS

[Captioner] 19:29:58
 ACTUALLY PART OF THE PURCHASE PRICE, AND WILL BE CREDITED

[Captioner] 19:30:01
 TOWARD THAT

[Captioner] 19:30:04
 6.5 -- 54, EXCUSE ME.
THE ADDITIONAL FUNDS THAT YOU'RE 

[Captioner] 19:30:09
REFERRING TO, THE 200 AND SOMETHING THOUSAND DOLLARS, YOU KNOW, WE

[Captioner] 19:30:12
 DO ANTICIPATE THAT THERE COULD BE COSTS THAT WE MIGHT NEED

[Captioner] 19:30:15
 TO ASSUME UPON OWNERSHIP OF THE BUILDING.


[Captioner] 19:30:18
YOU KNOW, THERE COULD BE SOME, YOU KNOW, MAINTENANCE ITEM THAT

[Captioner] 19:30:21
 JUST NEEDS IMMEDIATE ATTENTION FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE, AND SO

[Captioner] 19:30:25
 TO BE PREPARED FOR THAT, WE WANT

[Captioner] 19:30:28
 TO APPROPRIATE SOME MONEY TO ADDRESS ANY IMMEDIATE NEEDS

[Captioner] 19:30:30
 THAT MIGHT BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE BUILDING.


[Captioner] 19:30:34
AND AGAIN,

[Captioner] 19:30:37
 DAVE, YOU'RE WELCOME TO WEIGH IN.
>> Mr. Persselin: THAT WAS A GOOD

[Captioner] 19:30:39
 ANSWER.
>> Councilmember Campbell: YES, IT WAS 

[Captioner] 19:30:42
A GOOD ANSWER.
BUT HOW DID YOU COME UP WITH THE 

[Captioner] 19:30:45
AMOUNT?
WAS IT A PERCENTAGE

[Captioner] 19:30:49
 OF THE PURCHASE PRICE OR WHAT

[Captioner] 19:30:52
 REPRESENTS $210,000?
>> NO, IT'S REALLY AN ESTIMATE AT THIS 

[Captioner] 19:30:55
POINT.
WE HAVEN'T, YOU KNOW, BEEN ABLE TO GO 

[Captioner] 19:30:58
-- WE'RE NOT IN CONTRACT YET, SO WE HAVE

[Captioner] 19:31:02
 NOT DONE ANY DUE DILIGENCE AND TRYING TO, AGAIN, PLAN FOR

[Captioner] 19:31:06
 SOME UNFORESEEN EXPENSE, IT'S NOT BASED ON ANYTHING

[Captioner] 19:31:09
 PARTICULAR.
>> Councilmember Campbell: SO IN 

[Captioner] 19:31:12
ESSENCE, YOU MAY NOT USE THE MONEY?
>> THAT'S CORRECT, WE MAY NOT NEED 

[Captioner] 19:31:12
IT.
THAT'S POSSIBLE.


[Captioner] 19:31:16
>> Councilmember Campbell: OKAY.
AND THEN IT WOULD JUST STAY INTO THIS

[Captioner] 19:31:18
 STRATEGIC INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITY RESERVE?


[Captioner] 19:31:23
>> YES, OR BE REVERTED BACK, YES.
>> Councilmember Campbell:

[Captioner] 19:31:23
 OKAY.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:31:32
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
NEXT IS VICE MAYOR COX.


[Captioner] 19:31:35
>> Vice Mayor Cox: THANK YOU.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR

[Captioner] 19:31:38
 PRESENTATION.
I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I 

[Captioner] 19:31:41
WANTED TO GET CLARIFICATION

[Captioner] 19:31:44
 FROM IS THAT YOU HAVE THE 30 DAYS TO DO THE DUE DILIGENCE,

[Captioner] 19:31:48
 PLUS AN EXTENSION OF 15

[Captioner] 19:31:51
 DAYS.
MY CONCERN BASED ON MY

[Captioner] 19:31:54
 RESEARCH AND THE MARKET, THAT THERE'S A LOT OF

[Captioner] 19:31:58
 COMPETING CONTRACTORS TO COME OUT

[Captioner] 19:32:02
 AND ASSESS SOME OF THE WORK THAT MAY NEED

[Captioner] 19:32:05
 TO BE DONE, AND ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT FIRE

[Captioner] 19:32:08
 SPRINKLERS AND MONITORING SYSTEMS THAT ARE NOT EXISTING IN

[Captioner] 19:32:11
 THE BUILDING THAT'S NOTED IN

[Captioner] 19:32:15
 YOUR AGREEMENT RIGHT NOW.
I WANTED TO FIND OUT, DO WE

[Captioner] 19:32:18
 HAVE CONTRACTS FOR A MAJORITY OF THE

[Captioner] 19:32:23
 WORK THAT WE HAVE CONTRACTORS THAT ARE UNDER CONTRACT THAT CAN BE

[Captioner] 19:32:26
 DISPATCHED TO BE ABLE TO ASSESS THIS

[Captioner] 19:32:30
 NEW ACQUISITION IN THE

[Captioner] 19:32:33
 TIMELINE THAT HAS BEEN OUTLINED?
>> YES, THROUGH THE

[Captioner] 19:32:36
 ASSISTANCE OF OUR COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE BROKER, WE DO HAVE

[Captioner] 19:32:39
 THOSE CONTRACTS PREPARED TO BE ENTERED INTO, UPON

[Captioner] 19:32:42
 EXECUTION OF THE AGREEMENT.
>>

[Captioner] 19:32:46
 NOW, IF WE NEED MORE TIME, MAYBE THIS WOULD BE DIRECTED

[Captioner] 19:32:49
 AT OUR CITY

[Captioner] 19:32:52
 ATTORNEY, IS THERE ANY ADDITIONAL EXTENSION BEYOND

[Captioner] 19:32:55
 THE 15 DAYS THAT COULD BE ACCOMMODATED

[Captioner] 19:32:58
 IN CASE THERE IS

[Captioner] 19:33:02
 HIGH VOLUME AND HIGH WORKLOAD TO GET THROUGH THAT

[Captioner] 19:33:05
 MAY NOT BE RESPONSE BACK IN

[Captioner] 19:33:08
 TIME WITH THIS DEADLINE?


[Captioner] 19:33:11
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE TIME FRAME 

[Captioner] 19:33:14
SET FORTH IN THE PACKET ARE MATERIAL TERMS AND THAT THE SELLER INTENDS

[Captioner] 19:33:17
 TO STICK TO THOSE TERMS.
THERE WILL BE NO EXTENSIONS.


[Captioner] 19:33:20
>> Vice Mayor Cox: SO 45 DAYS MAX?
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: NOW THE

[Captioner] 19:33:23
 PARTIES -- IT'S POSSIBLE IN THEORY FOR THE PARTY TO AGREE TO

[Captioner] 19:33:26
 AN EXTENSION, BUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE

[Captioner] 19:33:29
 SELLER BELIEVES THAT THOSE TERMS ARE MATERIAL

[Captioner] 19:33:31
 AND INTENDS TO MAINTAIN THOSE TIME PERIODS.


[Captioner] 19:33:36
>> Vice Mayor Cox: OKAY.
I'M READY TO MAKE A MOTION.


[Captioner] 19:33:41
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY.
DID YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO ADD ALSO, 

[Captioner] 19:33:43
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN?
I SAW THAT YOU CAME BACK AGAIN BUT --


[Captioner] 19:33:47
>> Councilmember Salwan: OH, YES.


[Captioner] 19:33:50
>> Mayor Mei: I THINK SHE'S ABOUT READY TO MAKE A MOTION.


[Captioner] 19:33:54
WHY DON'T WE FINISH OUR MOTION FIRST AND WE'LL SEE IF SOMEONE SECONDS

[Captioner] 19:33:55
 IT.
>> Councilmember Salwan: I JUST HAD 

[Captioner] 19:33:57
SOME MORE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE LEASES --


[Captioner] 19:34:00
>> Mayor Mei: DO YOU WANT TO FINISH MAKING YOUR MOTION FIRST?


[Captioner] 19:34:02
>> Vice Mayor Cox: YES.
I WOULD LIKE TO MOVE TO ACCEPT THE 

[Captioner] 19:34:06
STAFF RECOMMENDATIONS TO ADOPT THE

[Captioner] 19:34:09
 RESOLUTION AS NOTED, AS WELL AS REALLOCATE

[Captioner] 19:34:13
 THE $6.750000 FROM

[Captioner] 19:34:15
 THE STRATEGIC INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITY RESERVE.


[Captioner] 19:34:18
>> Mayor Mei: I JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY ALSO

[Captioner] 19:34:22
 THAT AT THIS POINT WE'VE HAD QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS FROM THE COUNCIL BUT WE

[Captioner] 19:34:24
 ALSO HAVE TO HAVE THE PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD SO I'M GOING TO HAVE TO OPEN 

[Captioner] 19:34:28
THAT TOO.
DID YOU WANT A

[Captioner] 19:34:29
 SECOND?
>> SECOND.


[Captioner] 19:34:33
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: ONE JUST POINT OF

[Captioner] 19:34:34
 CLARIFICATION, BECAUSE IT IS AN IMPORTANT ONE.


[Captioner] 19:34:37
I WANT TO MAKE AN OBSERVATION THAT WE PUBLISHED

[Captioner] 19:34:42
 DOCUMENTS ON FRIDAY.
WE'VE

[Captioner] 19:34:44
 RE-PUBLISHED EDITED DOCUMENTS THIS EVENING, SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE 

[Captioner] 19:34:47
THAT I CLARIFY WITH THE VICE MAYOR THAT THE VICE

[Captioner] 19:34:50
 MAYOR'S MOTION INCLUDED THE RECOMMENDATION IN THE GREEN SHEET --


[Captioner] 19:34:52
>> Vice Mayor Cox: IN THE GREEN SHEET AS WELL.


[Captioner] 19:34:55
I STAND AMENDED TO ACCEPT THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT ARE

[Captioner] 19:34:59
 NOTED PREVIOUSLY FROM FRIDAY,

[Captioner] 19:35:03
 WITH THE ADOPTED RESOLUTION OF THE CITY COUNCIL OF

[Captioner] 19:35:06
 THE CITY OF FREMONT APPROVING AND AUTHORIZING THE CITY MANAGER

[Captioner] 19:35:09
 TO EXECUTE STANDARD OFFER AND AGREEMENT AND WITH THE

[Captioner] 19:35:12
 NOTED GREEN SHEET THAT'S BEEN PUBLISHED, JUST AS

[Captioner] 19:35:16
 OF TODAY, TO BE INCLUDED IN

[Captioner] 19:35:19
 THE RECOMMENDATION -- THE MOTION, I'M SORRY, AND THE MOTION, AND

[Captioner] 19:35:23
 SECONDLY, TO REALLOCATE

[Captioner] 19:35:34
 $650 MILLION FROM THE -- I'M

[Captioner] 19:35:38
 SORRY,

[Captioner] 19:35:44
 6.75 MILLION.
>> THAT'S A STEAL.


[Captioner] 19:35:47
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: JUST FOR FURTHER CLARITY OF RECORD, THIS 

[Captioner] 19:35:51
EVENING'S PACKET INCLUDES EXHIBITS THAT ARE

[Captioner] 19:35:54
 ADDITIONAL RECORDS, AS WELL AS THE REVISED

[Captioner] 19:35:58
 ADDENDUM, SO THE RECOMMENDATION THIS EVENING IS TO AUTHORIZE THE CITY 

[Captioner] 19:36:01
MANAGER TO EXECUTE THESE DOCUMENTS, SO SUBJECT TO THE REVISIONS THAT WE SEE 

[Captioner] 19:36:05
IN THIS EVENING'S GREEN SHEET.


[Captioner] 19:36:08
>> Vice Mayor Cox: THE GREEN SHEET, THE ADDENDUM, ALL OF THE ABOVE.


[Captioner] 19:36:12
>> Mayor Mei: I BELIEVE YOU MADE THE MOTION.


[Captioner] 19:36:14
WHO MADE THE SECOND?
OKAY.


[Captioner] 19:36:16
AND YOU'RE AGREEABLE TO THAT, COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN?


[Captioner] 19:36:20
OKAY, THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:36:22
SO --
>> Councilmember Salwan: I'LL SKIP THE 

[Captioner] 19:36:24
QUESTIONS.
I'LL JUST MAKE COMMENTS --


[Captioner] 19:36:26
>> Mayor Mei: I'D LOVE TO HEAR THE PUBLIC FIRST.


[Captioner] 19:36:29
>> Councilmember Salwan: OKAY, LET'S DO THAT.


[Captioner] 19:36:32
>> Mayor Mei: AT THIS TIME I'LL TURN IT OVER TO THE PUBLIC SPEAKER -- I'D

[Captioner] 19:36:34
 LIKE TO OPEN THE PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD.


[Captioner] 19:36:36
>> Ms. Gauthier: WE'LL START WITH KELLY ABREU.


[Captioner] 19:36:46
>> WHILE HAVING BEEN THROUGH WHAT

[Captioner] 19:36:49
 OHLONE COLLEGE WAS PUSHING A WEEK OR SO AGO, I CERTAINLY

[Captioner] 19:36:52
 HAVE NO COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE FINANCIAL REPORT AND THE

[Captioner] 19:36:55
 DETAILED REPORTING HERE.
THEY'VE GOT LOTS OF NUMBERS AND LOTS 

[Captioner] 19:36:58
OF DETAILS ABOUT THIS TRANSACTION, SO IT SEEMS TO

[Captioner] 19:37:02
 BE ALL WRITTEN DOWN ON

[Captioner] 19:37:05
 THE PAPERS, AS FAR AS I CAN TELL.
THEN IF YOU LOOK AT THE

[Captioner] 19:37:09
 NUMBERS THERE, IT'S 6 1/2 MILLION,

[Captioner] 19:37:12
 SO MANY SQUARE FEET, SO IT'S WHAT, $300 A SQUARE FOOT,

[Captioner] 19:37:15
 AND WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
WELL, THERE ARE

[Captioner] 19:37:19
 PEOPLE LIKE THE CITY -- LIKE A PARK

[Captioner] 19:37:23
 DISTRICT, OPEN SPACE DISTRICT, AND

[Captioner] 19:37:26
 THE EAST BAY

[Captioner] 19:37:29
 REGIONAL PARK DISTRICT, THEY'RE PAYING A THOUSAND OR $1,300 A SQUARE FOOT

[Captioner] 19:37:32
 TO RENOVATE OR BUILD NEW BUILDINGS.
IT'S

[Captioner] 19:37:36
 LIKE 1200, WHATEVER, IT'S A LOT -- SO THAT'S A LOT MORE, SO 1200

[Captioner] 19:37:38
 IS A LOT MORE THAN $300 A SQUARE FOOT.


[Captioner] 19:37:41
AND SO THAT'S GOOD, BUT THAT ASSUMES DO YOU

[Captioner] 19:37:45
 NEED -- YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE TO DECIDE STRATEGY HERE, DO

[Captioner] 19:37:48
 YOU NEED MORE OFFICE SPACE.
THE OTHER COMPANIES IN THE WORLD

[Captioner] 19:37:51
 ARE GETTING RID OF OFFICE SPACE, 20 OR 30% OF THE

[Captioner] 19:37:54
 OFFICE SPACE IN NEW YORK IS EMPTY, AND MAYBE MORE

[Captioner] 19:37:57
 THAN THAT IN SAN FRANCISCO.


[Captioner] 19:38:01
SO YOU'RE SAYING YOU WANT TO USE OFFICE SPACE FOR CITY

[Captioner] 19:38:04
 WORKERS, THAT WOULD BE GOOD, I GUESS.
IT'S RIGHT THERE, IF YOU NEED

[Captioner] 19:38:08
 IT, THAT WOULD BE GOOD.
ALSO ANOTHER POSSIBILITY THAT YOU 

[Captioner] 19:38:11
MENTIONED WAS A HIGH-DENSITY HOUSING, WHICH MIGHT BE A PROFITABLE

[Captioner] 19:38:14
 THING, ESPECIALLY SINCE YOU CONTROL THE PERMITTING AND

[Captioner] 19:38:18
 YOU CONTROL -- IT'S

[Captioner] 19:38:21
 KIND OF NICE TO BE ABLE TO JUST DO WHATEVER

[Captioner] 19:38:24
 YOU WANT AND

[Captioner] 19:38:28
 NOT VM THE CITY PLANNING DEPARTMENT OR WHATEVER TELL YOU WHAT TO

[Captioner] 19:38:32
 DO, YOU TELL THEM WHAT TO DO.
BUT THEN THE MAIN THING WOULD

[Captioner] 19:38:35
 BE THIS IDEA

[Captioner] 19:38:37
 OF THE CITY HALL, A MULTISTORE CITY HALL.


[Captioner] 19:38:41
CUPERTINO DID ONE, A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE DOING THEM, AND THAT'S

[Captioner] 19:38:44
 WHAT $100 MILLION OR MORE, BECAUSE IF YOU DO -- IF

[Captioner] 19:38:48
 YOU'RE NOT BUILD IT FOR LESS

[Captioner] 19:38:51
 THAN $1,000 A SQUARE FOOT, YOU NEED A LOT OF SCARE FEET AND IT'S GOING TO 

[Captioner] 19:38:55
ADD UCH TO $100 MILLION OR MORE, AND I CALL THAT, IN

[Captioner] 19:38:58
 LIGHT OF THE QUESTIONABLE NEED FOR MORE CITY OFFICE SPACE,

[Captioner] 19:39:01
 MAYBE A TAJ MAHAL CITY HALL.
TAJ

[Captioner] 19:39:02
 MAHAL.
VERY APPROPRIATE IN FREMONT.


[Captioner] 19:39:06
AND IN CLOSING, I'D LIKE TO MADE A MODEST PROPOSAL,

[Captioner] 19:39:09
 LIKE JONATHAN SWIFT DID IN 1729.
ONE OF

[Captioner] 19:39:12
 THE SELLERS HERE, YOU KNOW, WHEN PEOPLE SELL THEIR RANCHES OR

[Captioner] 19:39:15
 FARMS, THEY GET TO KEEP THEIR

[Captioner] 19:39:18
 NAME, IT'S STILL THE SMITH FARM OR WHATEVER, AFTER THEY SELL IT.


[Captioner] 19:39:22
AND SINCE ONE OF THE SELLERS HERE IS THE

[Captioner] 19:39:26
 ABRIO TRUST, AND I PROPOSED NAMING -- PUT A

[Captioner] 19:39:29
 BIG SIGN ON THIS BUILDING, THE

[Captioner] 19:39:31
 ABRILLO CENTER FOR MUNICIPAL INNOVATION.


[Captioner] 19:39:34
I REALLY THINK THAT SOUNDS GOOD.


[Captioner] 19:39:37
IN HONOR OF THE SELLER, THE

[Captioner] 19:39:41
 ABRILLO TRUST, I REALLY WANT TO EXPRESS MY SALUTATIONS

[Captioner] 19:39:43
 TO MY COMPATRIOTS.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:39:53
>> NEXT SPEAKER, IF THERE'S ANY.
>> Ms. Gauthier: THAT'S

[Captioner] 19:39:55
 THE LAST OF THE SPEAKERS IN PERSON AND IN ZOOM.


[Captioner] 19:39:58
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
AT THIS TIME, I'LL CLOSE THE

[Captioner] 19:40:01
 PUBLIC COMMENTS, AND THE PUBLIC HEARING AND TURN IT BACK TO 

[Captioner] 19:40:04
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN.
I'LL HAVE COMMENTS AFTER YOU'RE ALL 

[Captioner] 19:40:05
DONE, BUT GO AHEAD.
>> Councilmember Salwan: THANK YOU, 

[Captioner] 19:40:08
MADAME MAYOR.
WELL, I THINK THIS IS A NO-BRAINER.


[Captioner] 19:40:11
I MEAN, THIS IS A GREAT SITE RIGHT NEXT TO OUR EXISTING

[Captioner] 19:40:15
 PROPERTY.
AND SO

[Captioner] 19:40:18
 AN AREA KIND OF LIKE THE HEART OF FREMONT WHICH IS DOWNTOWN WHICH BRINGS 

[Captioner] 19:40:21
ALL OF OUR FIVE DISTRICTS TOGETHER, AND THIS ACCESS

[Captioner] 19:40:24
 LAND WILL GIVE US A LOT OF FLEXIBILITY TO CONSOLIDATE

[Captioner] 19:40:28
 OPERATIONS, AND TO BE ABLE TO DO DIFFERENT THINGS AT THE

[Captioner] 19:40:32
 VARIOUS SITES.
SO I THINK THIS

[Captioner] 19:40:35
 IS DEFINITELY A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION, AND I THINK WE

[Captioner] 19:40:38
 CAN DEFINITELY REALIZE A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT WE WERE LOOKING FOR IN

[Captioner] 19:40:42
 THE PAST.
AND IT WILL ALSO HAVE AN

[Captioner] 19:40:45
 ECONOMIC EFFECT ON THE ADJACENT PROPERTY OWNERS AND

[Captioner] 19:40:48
 HOPEFULLY STIMULATE THEM TO INVEST MORE AS WELL

[Captioner] 19:40:51
.
SO I THINK THE ONLY CONCERN, I MEAN, 

[Captioner] 19:40:54
THING THAT I THINK WE SHOULD LOOK AT IS THE CIVIC MASTER PLAN.


[Captioner] 19:40:57
WE DID HAVE THAT BEFORE.
I DON'T

[Captioner] 19:41:00
 KNOW IF WE SHELVED IT OR WHAT HAPPENED BUT IT KIND OF DIED SOMEWHERE.


[Captioner] 19:41:04
AND SO WE SHOULD LOOK AT THAT AGAIN AND SEE HOW THIS

[Captioner] 19:41:08
 PARCEL FITS INTO THE LARGER

[Captioner] 19:41:11
 DOWNTOWN VISION, AND WHAT IS POSSIBLE AND

[Captioner] 19:41:14
 HOW WE WOULD ACHIEVE SOME

[Captioner] 19:41:18
 THINGS, AND PERHAPS WE MAY NOT HAVE THE PLAN THAT WE HAD

[Captioner] 19:41:21
 BEFORE, MAYBE SCALED DOWN OR SIMPLIFIED IN SOME WAYS,

[Captioner] 19:41:24
 BUT DEFINITELY, YOU KNOW, WE SHOULD ACTIVELY SUPPORT THAT,

[Captioner] 19:41:28
 SO HOPEFULLY WE CAN HAVE A FOLLOW-UP IN THE FUTURE TO LOOK AT

[Captioner] 19:41:30
 THAT DOWNTOWN AREA.
BUT AGAIN, HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS AND 

[Captioner] 19:41:33
THIS IS JUST, YOU KNOW, FANTASTIC OPPORTUNITIES WE SHOULD DEFINITELY

[Captioner] 19:41:35
 TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT.
WE DON'T GET CHANCES LIKE THIS OFTEN.


[Captioner] 19:41:39
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
NEXT IS COUNCILMEMBER KENG

[Captioner] 19:41:41
.
>> Councilmember Keng: THANK YOU, 

[Captioner] 19:41:45
MADAME MAYOR.
SO I AGREE THAT THIS IS A WONDERFUL

[Captioner] 19:41:49
 OPPORTUNITY AS THIS LOCATION IS KIND OF A MISSING PIECE IN OUR

[Captioner] 19:41:52
 DOWNTOWN DISTRICT.
AND WE WOULD BE ABLE TO RELOCATE SOME 

[Captioner] 19:41:55
OF OUR CITY SERVICES, SUCH AS

[Captioner] 19:41:58
 OUR PLANNING DEPARTMENT AND THE

[Captioner] 19:42:02
 BUSINESS DEPARTMENT DOWN ON LIBERTY TO CLOSER

[Captioner] 19:42:06
 TO OTHER SERVICES AND IT WOULD BE

[Captioner] 19:42:09
 PROVIDING OUR COMMUNITY AND COMPREHENSIVE

[Captioner] 19:42:13
 SERVICE, AS WELL AS GIVING US KIND OF LONG TERM PLANNING AND FLEXIBILITY

[Captioner] 19:42:16
 IN OUR USAGE, SO I'M GLAD TO SEE THE SELLER HAS AGREED ON

[Captioner] 19:42:19
 OUR PROPOSAL AND IT'S A VERY FAIR PRICE AS

[Captioner] 19:42:22
 I HAD

[Captioner] 19:42:25
 SOME PRIOR REAL ESTATE EXPERIENCE IN BOTH COMMERCIAL AND

[Captioner] 19:42:29
 RESIDENTIAL, AND I THINK THIS IS ESPECIALLY I THINK GIVEN, YOU

[Captioner] 19:42:32
 KNOW, THEY HAD AGREED TO THE 30-DAY DUE

[Captioner] 19:42:35
 DILIGENCE, WHICH IS VERY GENEROUS.
SO I'M GLAD

[Captioner] 19:42:38
 TO SEE THAT, AND THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO

[Captioner] 19:42:41
 DO A VERY THOROUGH

[Captioner] 19:42:44
 INVESTIGATION ON MANY OF THE EXISTING LEASES AS WELL AS PROPERTY

[Captioner] 19:42:45
 CONDITIONS.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.


[Captioner] 19:42:51
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
SO I WANTED TO ADD SOME COMMENTS.


[Captioner] 19:42:54
I THINK FROM THE PERSPECTIVE, DO MAKE

[Captioner] 19:42:57
 SENSE IN TERMS OF THE PROXIMITY TO OUR VISION AND TRYING TO DELIVER THAT

[Captioner] 19:43:01
 COHESIVENESS WITHIN OUR PROJECT, AND ALSO HAVING THIS

[Captioner] 19:43:05
 DOWN TOWN SPINE.
ALSO HAVING SEEN SOME OF THE PAST

[Captioner] 19:43:08
 IN TERMS OF THE PROPOSALS AT ONE POINT IN TERMS OF CIVIC,

[Captioner] 19:43:11
 I THINK IN SOME WAYS IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY, TOO, FOR

[Captioner] 19:43:14
 US TO REVISIT THE ORIGINAL

[Captioner] 19:43:16
 CONSTRUCTION.
AT THAT TIME, WE HAD A CHOICE WHEN WE 

[Captioner] 19:43:20
LOOKED AT DIFFERENT PROJECT, AND I THINK FOR THE COUNCIL FROM WHAT WE'RE

[Captioner] 19:43:22
 SEEING NOW, THAT WE MADE THE RIGHT CHOICE AT THAT TIME.


[Captioner] 19:43:26
I KNOW SOME PEOPLE REFER TO BUILDINGS AS TAJ MAHALS AND

[Captioner] 19:43:29
 HAVING SAT IN MANY CORPORATE LOCATIONS AND BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR

[Captioner] 19:43:32
 SOME OF THOSE COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE, I THINK THAT THIS WAS THE

[Captioner] 19:43:35
 RIGHT DECISION FOR THE IMPETUS IN TERMS OF HAVING THE DOWNTOWN EVENT 

[Captioner] 19:43:39
CENTER, WHICH HAS BEEN VERY WELL UTILIZED IN BRINGING A PLACE

[Captioner] 19:43:42
 OF GATHERING, AND I THINK THAT WHEN I

[Captioner] 19:43:45
 LOOK AT THE OPPORTUNITY OF THE NEXT STEP, IT GIVES US A CHANCE TO LOOK

[Captioner] 19:43:48
 AT HOW MATERIALS HAVE CHANGED, BUILDING STYLES HAVE CHANGED.


[Captioner] 19:43:51
I'VE SEEN IN TERMS OF -- JUST IN TERMS OF ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND

[Captioner] 19:43:55
 GREEN CONSTRUCTION, AND MODULAR, THERE'S SOME OTHER OPPORTUNITIES.


[Captioner] 19:44:00
I HOPE TO COME BACK AND JOIN YOU ALL FOR WHEN THAT DAY

[Captioner] 19:44:03
 COMES, AND WE DO OPEN IT.
I THINK THAT THERE'S ALSO A

[Captioner] 19:44:06
 CERTAIN DEGREE OF EFFICIENCY.
RIGHT NOW WE HAD -- WHEN

[Captioner] 19:44:09
 WE SHUT DOWN THE PREVIOUS CITY HALL, MOVED TO THIS

[Captioner] 19:44:12
 LOCATION, AND IT WASN'T MEANT TO BE A PERMANENT SOLUTION, IT WAS MEANT TO BE

[Captioner] 19:44:15
 AN OPPORTUNITY WHERE WE BRING PEOPLE BACK TOGETHER AND HAVING

[Captioner] 19:44:18
 BEEN TO VISIT SOME OF THE OTHER CITY HALLS AND OTHER MUNICIPALITIES AND 

[Captioner] 19:44:21
ALSO IN OTHER REGIONS, IT DOES GATHER TO HAVE SOME

[Captioner] 19:44:25
 OTHER COHESIVENESS IN TERMS OF HAVING THE DEPARTMENTS IN

[Captioner] 19:44:28
 CLOSER PROXIMITY TO ONE ANOTHER, WHILE ZOOM IS GREAT,

[Captioner] 19:44:31
 AND WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR TELEWORKING AND MANY OF US ARE TRYING

[Captioner] 19:44:34
 TO REIMAGINE WHAT THE FUTURE IS.
I DO HEAR FROM

[Captioner] 19:44:37
 SO MANY OTHER PEOPLE THAT IT IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THE

[Captioner] 19:44:41
 GATHERING SPACE AND THE COFFEE TALKS AND OTHER THINGS TO BRING PEOPLE

[Captioner] 19:44:44
 TOGETHER, AND I FEEL THAT IT WOULD

[Captioner] 19:44:47
 BE A GOOD ICON FOR US IN TERMS OF IF YOU LOOK AT RIGHT NOW

[Captioner] 19:44:50
 SUNNYVALE JUST OPENED UP THEIR LOCATION, AND THE FACT THAT THEY WERE 

[Captioner] 19:44:53
ABLE TO UTILIZE A LOT OF THE BUILDING

[Captioner] 19:44:57
 AND ALSO THE GATHERING

[Captioner] 19:45:00
 SPACE IN ART AND CULTURE THAT I THINK WOULD HELP DEFINE OUR CITY AS WE

[Captioner] 19:45:03
 MOVE FORWARD.
WE'VE GONE FROM BEING FIVE SMALL TOWNS 

[Captioner] 19:45:06
THAT CAME TOGETHER, AND AS WE MOVE FORWARD TO THE NEXT PHASES OF

[Captioner] 19:45:10
 OUR CITY, I

[Captioner] 19:45:12
 THINK THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WOULD HOPEFULLY BE AN OPPORTUNITY, WHETHER 

[Captioner] 19:45:15
WE USE IT FOR OUR CITY CIVIC CENTER OR WE'VE TALKED ABOUT ALSO IN THE

[Captioner] 19:45:19
 PAST PERFORMING ARTS, OR ALSO JUST A

[Captioner] 19:45:22
 GATHERING SPACE IN TERMS OF HOUSING AND SOME OF THE

[Captioner] 19:45:26
 FULFILLMENTS WE NEED TO COMMIT TO ALREADY WITH OUR

[Captioner] 19:45:30
 HOUSING ELEMENT, SO THIS WILL ALLOW MULTIPLE OPTIONS IN TERMS OF OUR

[Captioner] 19:45:32
 NEXT STEPS.
SO I'M VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THIS.


[Captioner] 19:45:35
WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND.
DID YOU HAVE ANOTHER COMMENT?


[Captioner] 19:45:38
>> Vice Mayor Cox: I JUST WANT TO MAKE ONE COMMENT.


[Captioner] 19:45:42
I THINK IN LIGHT OF

[Captioner] 19:45:45
 EVERYTHING, I THINK THIS IS NOT ONLY A WONDERFUL OPPORTUNITY, IT'S

[Captioner] 19:45:48
 A CHANCE IN A LIFETIME, THAT YOU GET A CHANCE TO BUY SOMETHING LIKE THIS THAT

[Captioner] 19:45:52
 IS AS CLOSE

[Captioner] 19:45:55
 TO -- AS CLOSE AS WE COULD GET.
AND I ALSO THINK

[Captioner] 19:45:58
 THAT IT IS FOR THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT

[Captioner] 19:46:03
 THAT, YES, IT WOULD BE OCCUPIED AND OWNED BY CITY OF FREMONT, BUT ALSO

[Captioner] 19:46:06
 PASSING IT ON TO THE COMMUNITY FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO

[Captioner] 19:46:10
 UTILIZE FROM YEARS GOING FORWARD, AND I

[Captioner] 19:46:13
 THINK THAT IT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT'S SO

[Captioner] 19:46:17
 DESERVING OF OUR CITY OF FREMONT, OUR

[Captioner] 19:46:20
 BUSINESSES, SCHOOLS, EVERYONE HERE IN FREMONT CAN BE ABLE TO TAKE PART AND

[Captioner] 19:46:23
 ENJOY IN SOME FORM OR ANOTHER POSSIBLY BEING

[Captioner] 19:46:26
 ABLE TO USE THIS

[Captioner] 19:46:30
 BUILDING, AND SO I JUST APPRECIATE THE CITY STAFF,

[Captioner] 19:46:33
 I APPRECIATE DCG AND ALL

[Captioner] 19:46:36
 THE OWNERS OF THE BUILDING FOR COMING TOGETHER TO COLLABORATE TO MAKE THIS

[Captioner] 19:46:40
 HAPPEN.


[Captioner] 19:46:43
, AND IT TAKING TEAM WORK OF EVERYONE TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN, SO I

[Captioner] 19:46:47
 APPLAUD ALL OF YOU, SO THAT'S WHY I WANTED TO QUICKLY PUT THAT MOTION

[Captioner] 19:46:50
 OUT AND GET IT DONE, BECAUSE IT WAS SOMETHING THAT I

[Captioner] 19:46:52
 FELT COMPELLED THAT WOULD BE GREAT FOR EVERYONE.


[Captioner] 19:46:55
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
>> Mayor Mei: WE HAVE A MOTION AND A 

[Captioner] 19:46:58
SECOND AND I'LL WAIT TO SEE THE COUNCIL'S VOTE, BUT I THINK JUDGING 

[Captioner] 19:47:01
FROM ALL THE COMMENTS THAT WE'VE HEARD THUS FAR, THAT THERE IS SUPPORT.


[Captioner] 19:47:04
SO PLEASE VOTE.


[Captioner] 19:47:12
THE MOTION PASSES UNANIMOUSLY.


[Captioner] 19:47:16
SO CONGRATULATIONS THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO MAKE THIS DECISION, AND WE

[Captioner] 19:47:19
 LOOK FORWARD TO COMING BACK AND HAVING THE NEXT STEPS ON THIS.


[Captioner] 19:47:25
NEXT ON OUR AGENDA IS COMMITTEE REPORTS ON

[Captioner] 19:47:27
 COMMITTEE ASSIGNMENTS.
ARE THERE ANY REPORTS OUT?


[Captioner] 19:47:36
I'LL SHARE ONE REAL QUICKLY.
I SIT ON THE U.S. CONFERENCE OF

[Captioner] 19:47:40
 MAYORS BOARD, AND I CURRENTLY CHAIR THE

[Captioner] 19:47:43
 AAPI ALLIANCE, AND TODAY WE ISSUED A

[Captioner] 19:47:46
 STATEMENT, AND REQUEST FOR DONATION AND

[Captioner] 19:47:49
 INFORMATION ON THE LAHAINA RESIDENTS.


[Captioner] 19:47:54
SO I JUST WANTED TO SAY IF WE COULD END THE MEETING IN A MOMENT

[Captioner] 19:47:57
 OF SILENCE FOR SOME OF THE IMPACTS THAT

[Captioner] 19:48:00
 WE'VE SEEN THIS PAST WEEK IN TERMS OF THE TRAGEDY OVER IN

[Captioner] 19:48:03
 MAUI, AND WE'VE ASKED PEOPLE

[Captioner] 19:48:07
 TO LOOK AT THE CONNECTIONS WE HAVE AS

[Captioner] 19:48:10
 MAYORS, CERTAINLY OHANA, THE IDEA IS

[Captioner] 19:48:14
 FAMILY, SO IF WE COULD THINK ABOUT ALL THEIRS, THE TRAGEDIES AND

[Captioner] 19:48:17
 IMPACTS.
