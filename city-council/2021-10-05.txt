19:10:32 
AND I BELIEVE WE HAVE THIS EVENING JENNIFER
19:10:35  WEST FROM
STOPWASTE, WHO WILL BE JOIN
19:10:38 ING US AND WILL ACCEPT THIS
19:10:40  AND
SAY A FEW WORDS.
WELCOME, JENNIFER.

19:10:43 >> THANK YOU.
CAN YOU HEAR ME OKAY?
>> Mayor Mei: YES.

19:10:46 >> OKAY, GREAT.
I WANTED TO
19:10:50  SAY THANK YOU TO MAYOR MEI AND COUNCILMEMBERS
19:10:53 
THIS EVENING.
SAVE MONEY, CUT POLLUTION,
19:10:56  CREATE JOBS.
IN CELEBRATION OF ENERGY EFFICIENCY
19:11:00  DAY, I'M GLAD TO ADDRESS
THE FREMONT CITY
19:11:07  COUNCIL THIS EVENING.
MY NAME IS JENNIFER WEST, AND I WORK FOR
19:11:11  STOPWASTE, A
GOVERNMENT AGENCY SERVING FREMONT, THE COUNTY
19:11:14  OF ALAMEDA,
AND ALL OF THE OTHER CITIES IN ALAMEDA COUNTY
19:11:17 .
STOPWASTE SI PORTS OUR LOCAL
19:11:20  GOVERNMENT IN REDUCING
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS
19:11:24  THROUGH EFFICIENT USE OF RESOURCES.
THERE ARE LOTS OF WAYS TO REDUCE OUR
19:11:27  EMISSIONS.
IT CAN LOOK LIKE PROPER SORTING AND RECYCLE
19:11:30 ING BY RESIDENTS
AND BUSINESSES.
IT LOOKS LIKE INCREASED
19:11:33  USE OF COMPOST IN OUR LANDSCAPES.
REDUCED
19:11:37  FOOD WASTE IN OUR  SCHOOLS AND HOMES.
ALONG WITH INCREASED
19:11:40  DONATIONS OF EXCESS FOOD.
AND INCREASING
19:11:44  OUR ENERGY EFFICIENCY IN OUR BUILDINGS.

19:11:47 WHETHER THEY'RE BUILDINGS THAT ARE OWNED BY THE CITY,
BUSINESSES
19:11:50 , OR HOMES IN OUR COMMUNITIES.
ENERGY EE FISH SEAL
19:11:54  EFFICIENCY IS AN IMPORTANT
19:11:57  LEG ON
THE THREE  LEGGED STOOL THAT IS
19:12:01  DECARBONIZATION OF OUR
 BUILDINGS.
ENERGY EFFICIENCY WORKS TOGETHER WITH 
19:12:05 SECURING A CLEAN
ELECTRICITY SOURCE THROUGH EAST BAY
19:12:07  COMMUNITY ENERGY, AND
THEN SWITCHING ALL FOSSIL
19:12:11  GAS USES TO THAT CLEAN ELECTRICITY.

19:12:14 WITHOUT ENERGY EFFICIENCY, WE USE MORE ELECTRICITY THAN
19:12:17 
NEEDED AND COULD PUT A GREATER DEMAND ON THE GRID
19:12:20  THAN
NECESSARY, CAUSING EX-
19:12:24  EXPENSIVE
19:12:27 
INFRASTRUCTURE STRAIN.
ONE EXAMPLE I'LL HIGHLIGHT IS 
19:12:30 INSTALLING HEAT PUMP WATER
HEETD HEATERS
19:12:34  INSTEAD OF FOSSIL GAS WATER HEATERS.
THIS IS ONE WAY WE
19:12:37  CAN INCREASE EFFICIENCY AND ALSO MOVE
AWAY FROM THE POLLUTION CAUS
19:12:40 ED BY FOSSIL FUELS.
WITH EAST BAY COMMUNITY ENERGY, OUR
19:12:43  PARTNER, PROVIDING
CLEANER AND GREENER ELECTRICITY
19:12:46 , THESE SUPER EFFICIENT
APPLIANCES ARE TOOLS WE NEED TO
19:12:50  COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE AS
THEY ARE THREE AND FOUR TIMES
19:12:53  AS EFFICIENT AS THE GAS
ALTERNATIVES.

19:12:57 WE ARE WORKING WITH  MANUFACTURERS, DISTRIBUTORS
19:13:00 ,
 AND LOCAL CONTRACTORS TO MAKE SURE
19:13:03  THEY'RE TRAINED AND
READY TO INSTALL HEAT PUMP WATER HEATER
19:13:06 S IN OUR HOMES, WHILE
SIMULTANEOUSLY EDUCATING
19:13:10  RESIDENTS ABOUT THE BENEFITS OF
THESE APPLIANCES.

19:13:15 STOPWASTE IS PART OF A LARGER REGIONAL ORGANIZATION ALREADY
MENTIONED,
19:13:18  THE BAY AREA REGIONAL ENERGY NETWORK, OR
19:13:21  R
19:13:25  BAREN.

19:13:28 ASSISTING RESIDENTS, MUNICIPALITIES
19:13:32 , PUTTING IN PLACE THE
ENERGY EFFICIENT SYSTEMS WE NEED TO MEET OUR STATE
19:13:35 'S
AMBITIOUS GOALS, AND IN FREMONT, THAT TRANSLATES
19:13:38  TO ALMOST
400 HOME ENERGY SCORES
19:13:41  CONDUCTED WITH NEARLY HALF OF THOSE
19:13:44 
THIS YEAR, OVER 800 HOME
19:13:48  PLUS  MEASURES INSTALLED FOR
A TOTAL OF
19:13:51  INCENTIVES SPENT OF OVER $350,000.

19:13:56 SINCE 2015, B
19:13:59 AYREN HAS GIVEN UPGRADES IN
19:14:02  MULTIFAMILY RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS AS WELL WITH FREMONT HAVING
19:14:05 
 400 UNITS THAT HAVE BEEN UPGRADED WITH A TOTAL REBATE

19:14:08 AMOUNT OF $300,000, WHICH COVERS MORE THAN HALF
19:14:12  OF THE
PROJECT'S TOTAL COSTS.

19:14:15 COMBINED, ALL OF THESE MEASURES ADD UP TO TAKING
19:14:18  83 CARS OFF
THE ROAD EACH YEAR
19:14:22 .
THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE TO CELEBRATE THE CITY OF

19:14:25 FREMONT, FOR RECOGNIZING THE IMPORTANT ROLE THAT ENERGY
EFFICIENCY  PLAYS IN
19:14:28  REACHING OUR GOALS OF CLEANER AREA
19:14:30 
AND A HEALTHY PLANET FOR EVERYONE.
THANK YOU.

19:14:37 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
REALLY APPRECIATE,
19:14:40  JENNIFER, YOU FOR JOINING US AND FOR THE

19:15:04  OUR CITY

RECOGNIZED FOR ITS LEADERSHIP IN ADDRESSING A LOT OF THESE

19:15:11 CLIMATE INITIATIVES.
SO I'M SO DELIGHTED TO BE ABLE TO SHARE THAT WITH
19:15:15  THE
COMMUNITY AND THAT'S THE REASON WHY WE
19:15:18  WERE ABLE TO RECEIVE
19:15:21 
SIX AWARDS AT THE -- MOST RECENTLY THE CALIFORNIA CITIES,
19:15:23 
AND IN FACT WE WERE THE LARGEST CITY TO RECEIVE THE

19:15:27 PLATINUM AWARD SO FAR.
AND SO

AS WE MOVE FORWARD.

19:15:33 THANK YOU.

19:15:36  AGENDA IS A

SUPPORT WAIVER OF FEES ASSOCIATED WITH THE APPLICATION

19:21:25 PROCESS TO COME TO THE U.S. FOR THIS EMERGENCY HUMANITARIAN
19:21:28 
EFFORT, AND ESPECIALLY
19:21:31  WE SENT LETTERS OF SUPPORT AND OUR
19:21:34 
FULL SUPPORT IN TERMS OF WORKING WITH SENATORS
19:21:38  PADILLA, BLUE
19:21:41  BLUMENTHAL
19:21:44  AND IT'S ALSO SUPPORTED BY
SENATOR FEINSTEIN.
I
19:21:47  WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW I HAD A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY AS I
19:21:49  SIT
ON THE U.S. CONFERENCE OF MAYORS AND WE HAD THIS

19:21:52 CONVERSATION WITH MY FELLOW COLLEAGUES IN THE LEADERSHIP
TEAM THIS PAST WEEKEND,
19:21:56  AND IN FACT, NOT ONLY WAS I ABLE TO
TALK WITH MY
19:21:59  FELLOW MAYORS, BUT I WAS ABLE TO PLEAD THIS
DIRECTLY WITH
19:22:03  SECRETARY MY YOUR
19:22:07  MIYORK
19:22:10 A, TO BE ABLE TO
TALK TO THE WHITE HOUSE REPRESENTATIVES
19:22:13  AS WELL AS THE STATE
DEPARTMENT ON HOW
19:22:16  IMPORTANT IT IS.
AND I THINK WHAT IT SPEAKS
19:22:20  TO, AND I'M REALLY HUMBLED THAT
THE SECRETARY CAME
19:22:23  TO TALK TO ME AFTERWARDS PERSONALLY, IS
THAT
19:22:30  HE COULD REALLY UNDERSTAND FROM OUR DISCUSSIONS, HOW
CRITICAL THE
19:22:33  NEEDS ARE.
SO MANY RESIDENTS IN OUR CITY
19:22:36  THEMSELVES HAVE STORIES WHERE
THEY'RE
19:22:40  EITHER
19:22:43  THEIR CHILDREN OR DIRECTLY EXPERIENCED
THE IMMIGRANT TRANSITION TO THE
19:22:46  UNITED STATES, WHETHER IT'S
THROUGH
19:22:51  THOSE WHO HAVE --
19:22:54  THE JAPANESE, THE CHINESE, SO MANY
DIFFERENT GROUPS.
AND
19:22:58  KNOWING THIS AND THE CHALLENGES WITH THIS JOURNEY,
19:23:02  AND I
PERSONALLY HAVING HEARD SO MANY OF THE MESSAGES WHEN PEOPLE

19:23:05 ARE ASKING US FOR SUPPORT, I
19:23:08  THINK THAT TO BE ABLE TO
EXPRESS HOW
19:23:12  IMPEDING IT IS TO HAVE -- TO MAKE A
19:23:15  CHOICE ON
WHEN IT COMES TO FILING FEES AND THE LEGAL  FEES, WHO
19:23:18  DO
YOU CHOOSE, HOW CAN YOU CHOOSE ONE OF YOUR FAMILY MEMBERS

19:23:21 OVER ANOTHER, AND SO
19:23:25  I APPRECIATE THAT SECRETARY MAYOR
19:23:29 
MAYORKAS, AS THE SON OF IMMIGRANTS,
19:23:32  COULD REALLY UNDERSTAND
THE SITUATION, AND I LOOK FORWARD TO
19:23:36  CONTINUING TO AMPLIFY
THAT THIS IS SOMETHING WE'RE CONTINUING TO SEE
19:23:39  IN TERMS OF
THE BILLS AND LEGISLATION AND HOPEFULLY
19:23:42  BIPARTISAN SUPPORT
ON THIS UNDERSTANDING.
SO I JUST WANTED TO EXPRESS
19:23:45  THAT THE CITY HAS JUST STARTED
THIS PROCESS OF GIVING OUT OUR
19:23:49  FUNDS, AND WE ASK
ORGANIZATIONS TO PLEASE VISIT OUR
19:23:52  WEBPAGE AT FREMONT.GOV
19:23:58 ,
IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A DONATION OR REQUEST THE FUNDS.

19:24:01 I WANT TO THANK, AGAIN, RONA POPAL FOR HELPING ME AND THE
CITY AND
19:24:04  SO MANY OTHERS UNDERSTAND THE NEED OF THIS WHEN WE
REACH
19:24:08 ED OUT EARLY ON,
19:24:11  TO BE ABLE TO SHARE THAT WITH THE
19:24:15 
AFGHAN DIASPORA HERE.
AND I HOPE THAT THIS
19:24:17  WILL HELP A LITTLE BIT WITH AWARENESS
OF THIS RESOLUTION, AND
19:24:21  IT'S JUST ONE OF MANY STEPS AS WE
MOVE FORWARD.
SO THANK YOU AGAIN,
19:24:24  RONA, AND TO ALL THOSE WHO ARE HELPING
WITH THIS.

19:24:27 MY HEART GOES OUT TO THE COMMUNITY AND I
19:24:30  LOOK FORWARD TO BE
ABLE TO SUPPORT AND WELCOME THOSE
19:24:34  WHO DESERVE THAT SAFETY
19:24:37  AN
SANCTITY OF LIFE
19:24:40 .
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH.

19:24:45 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:24:48 NEXT, WE'LL HAVE OUR ORAL COMMUNICATIONS,
19:24:51  AND THOSE ARE FOR
PEOPLE WISHING TO SPEAK ON AN ITEM
19:24:54  THAT'S NOT AGENDIZED THIS
EVENING.
AND I SEE
19:24:57  THAT WE HAVE A COUPLE HANDS THAT ARE RAISED AT
THIS TIME.

19:25:04 THIS IS FOR AGAIN ITEMS NOT SCHEDULED THIS EVENING.
THERE'S
19:25:07  ONE ITEM SCHEDULED AND YOU WILL SPEAK AT THAT TIME
19:25:10 .
COULD WE PLEASE CALL THE SPEERKS
19:25:14  SPEAKERS?
ALSO AGAIN, COMMUNICATIONS
19:25:17  RECEIVED VIA EMAIL ARE PLACED
19:25:21  ON FILE AND CONSIDERED PART OF THE PUBLIC RECORD.
WE'LL
19:25:24  BEGIN FIRST WITH MARY.
WELL
19:25:27 WELCOME, MARY.

19:25:37 MOWRY, I'M SORRY, I CAN'T HEAR YOU.
IF YOU COULD UNMUTE
19:25:41 ?

19:25:47 >> I'M NOT SURE IF I'M THE MARY BEING REFERRED TO.
ARE YOU LOOKING FOR
19:25:50  MARY WILLIAMS?
>> Mayor Mei: YOU'RE THE MARY WE UNMUTED.

19:25:52 >> OKAY.
I DIDN'T KNOW I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK.

19:25:55 I WANTED TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE
19:25:58  MEASURE FOR THE -- I
DON'T HAVE THE ITEM, I THINK
19:26:01  IT'S ITEM 5A.
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY, MOWRY, I'M SORRY,
19:26:04  MARY, WE'LL
19:26:07  CALL YOU
AT THAT TIME.
THIS IS FOR ITEMS THAT
19:26:10  ARE NOT AGENDIZED.
THIS IS PUBLIC COMMENTS.
WE'LL CALL
19:26:14  YOU AT THAT TIME.
THANK YOU.
NEXT SPEAKER IS PUR
19:26:17 USHOTHAM.
IF YOU COULD
19:26:20  UNMUTE?

19:26:31 WELCOME.
>> HI.
GOOD EVENING.

19:26:36 THIS IS REGARDING THE COUNCIL DECISION ON
19:26:40  --
19:26:44  21 -- PARKWAY
BETWEEN WASHINGTON BOULEVARD AND
19:26:47  AND -- ROAD, WHICH IS
REPLACING THE --
19:26:52  VISION ZERO WITH A NEW PROPOSAL THAT NARROWS
19:26:56 
 THE -- LANES
19:26:59  -- BIKE LANE.
I WANTED
19:27:02  TO LET YOU KNOW THAT I'M HAPPY WITH THE
19:27:05  CURRENT
PROPOSAL AS IT MAKES SAFETY
19:27:09  -- ON THIS STRETCH OF THE ROAD.
WE STRONGLY BELIEVE THIS
19:27:13  IS -- PROPOSAL FROM CITY OF FREMONT
WHICH IS ELEVATING
19:27:16  ALREADY EXISTING SAFETY ISSUES ON THIS
STRETCH OF THE ROAD.

19:27:20 BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE, WE INVITE YOU TO VISIT OUR
NEIGHBORHOOD
19:27:24  AND SEE THE STREET TO REALIZE HOW IT IS
DIFFERENT COMPARED TO
19:27:27  OTHER PARTS OF THE CITY.
WE TRULY HOPE THAT WOULD
19:27:30  CHANGE YOUR MIND AND HELP TO -- AND
GO
19:27:33  FOR SAFER MEASURES ON THIS ROAD.
THANK YOU
19:27:36  IN ADVANCE.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU
19:27:40  FOR YOUR COMMENTS.
NEXT SPEAKER IS JOHN
19:27:46  JOHN HINDS.
WELCOME, MR. HINDS.
>> HELLO, EVERYONE.

19:27:51 FREMONT'S MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL ARE NOT PAID VERY WELL FOR
19:27:54 
THE WORK THEY DO.
THAT'S PARTLY BECAUSE THE JOB
19:27:57 S ARE DEFINED AS PART-TIME AND
THAT MUCH IS A GOOD
19:28:01  THING.
IT FORCES YOU TO KEEP AT LEAST ONE FOOT IN THE
19:28:04  REAL WORLD
WITH THE REST OF US HOLDING
19:28:07  DOWN A JOB, RUNNING A BUSINESS
OR RAISING A FAMILY, AND IT MEANS THAT
19:28:10  FEWER OF YOU WILL
HAVE CHOSEN ALREADY TO MAKE POLITICS
19:28:14  A CAREER AS HAPPENS IN
CITYS THAT MAKE THESE JOBS
19:28:17  FULL TIME.
IN CONTRAST, SOME
19:28:21  FREMONT'S TOP LEVEL STAFF ARE VERY
GENEROUS
19:28:24 LY PAID.
AS BECAME SO EVIDENT IN THE LAST
19:28:27  FEW DAYS.
WHEN YOU TRY TO COMPARE THESE STAFF JOBS
19:28:30  TO WORK IN THE
PRIVATE SECTOR, IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO LOOK
19:28:33  AT HOW MANY PEOPLE
WORK FOR THEM OR HOW LARGE A BUDGET THEY
19:28:37  OVERSEE.
THESE JOBS DO NOT HAVE
19:28:40  THE SAME PRESSURE TO PRODUCE, TO
DELIVER OR TO GROW
19:28:43  AS THEY WOULD IN A PRIVATE COMPANY.
THEY ARE GENEROUSLY PAID.

19:28:47 IT IS PERHAPS BECAUSE OF THIS IMBALANCE IN PAY
19:28:50  THAT THE
COUNCIL HAS TENDED TO RELY ON STAFF SO HEAVILY.

19:28:54 AS IF TO SAY, WELL, THEY'RE BEING PAID FOR THIS, MIGHT AS
WELL LEAVE TO
19:28:57  THEM.
BUT THIS LEADS TO A PATTERN IN WHICH TIME AFTER
19:29:00  TIME, STAFF
PUTS A SINGLE OPTION
19:29:03  IN FRONT OF THE COUNCIL FOR A YES OR NO
 VOTE, AND
19:29:07  IF THE COUNCIL ASKS FOR A REVISION OR
ADDITIONAL OPTIONS
19:29:10 , IT'S TREATED AS IF THEY'RE BEING BIG
MEAN
19:29:13 IES RATHER THAN JUST THE REGULAR ORDER OF BUSINESS WHEN
19:29:17 
YOU SHOW -- TO YOUR BOSS AND YOUR BOSS TELLS YOU
19:29:19  TO DO IT
OVER.
THAT'S WHAT ALWAYS HAPPENS TO  ME.

19:29:22 THIS PATTERN ALSO MEANS THAT WHOEVER DOES PREPARE THAT ONE
OPTION IS EFFECTIVELY
19:29:25  STEERING THE COUNCIL TOWARD A CHOICE
THAT THEY PREFER.

19:29:29 WHETHER THAT'S JUST THEIR PROFESSIONAL JUDGMENT OR WHATEVER
IS
19:29:33  MORE CONVENIENT FOR THEM, WHATEVER FITS BEST WITH THEIR
19:29:36 
CAREER GOALS OR WHATEVER FITS THEIR OWN PRIVATE TASTES,
19:29:39  OR
ALL OF THE ABOVE.
THE PROBLEM GETS A LITTLE WORSE WHEN
19:29:42  STAFF MANAGES TO LINE
UP THEIR OWN FUNDING, LIKE
19:29:45  THROUGH A GRANT.
THIS MAKES THE COUNCIL HAPPY, NATURALLY
19:29:48 , BECAUSE IT TAKES
SOME PRESSURE OFF THE GENERAL FUND, BUT
19:29:51  THE GRANT MONEY NOW
HAS TO BE SPENT UNDER THE
19:29:55  TERMS OF THE GRANT, AND THE CITY'S
DIRECTION ENDS UP
19:29:58  BEING SET BY SOMEONE WHO NOT ONLY WASN'T
ELECTED HERE
19:30:01  AND DOESN'T LIVE HERE, BUT DOESN'T EVEN HAVE A
CONNECTION TO
19:30:04  THE CITY, EXCEPT THAT THEY DANGLE
19:30:07  THE PERSON
IN FRONT OF US.
AS THE COUNCIL GOES THROUGH THE WORK 
19:30:10 OF FILLING THE OPEN
POSITION, PLEASE CONSIDER
19:30:13  ALSO A MUCH MORE
19:30:16  OVERHAUL
OF TOP LEVEL STAFF POSITIONS.
OR AT THE VERY LEAST, SOME NEW
19:30:20  EXPECTATIONS.
THANK YOU.

19:30:24 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
NEXT SPEAKER IS
19:30:27  C
19:30:31  CASEY FARMER.
>> THANK YOU, MAYOR.

19:30:34 GOOD EVENING.
MY NAME IS CASEY FARMER, AND

ITS  SUPERVISORI

19:31:46 OUR NEXT HEARING IS ON  OCTOBER 12TH, NEXT
19:31:49  TUESDAY
, AT 12:00 NOON VIA ZOOM, AND SOME
19:31:53  OF THE QUESTIONS WE'RE
ASKING THE PUBLIC TO WEIGH IN ON
19:31:56  ARE, WHERE IS YOUR
COMMUNITY LOCATED, AND TO BE SPECIFIC IN
19:31:59  THAT 
GEOGRAPHY, WHAT CONNECTS
19:32:03  YOUR COMMUNITY ECONOMICALLY,
SOCIALLY OR CULTURALLY,

SUCH AS GOALS
19:32:09  FOR THE FUTURE OR SHARED CHALLENGES,

COMMUNITIES OF INTEREST NEARBY WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE CONJOIN

THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME THIS EVENING.

19:32:39 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU, CASEY.
WE APPRECIATE THAT.
WE'LL BE
19:32:42  SURE TO SHARE THAT.
I THINK IT'S ALREADY ON THE WEBSITE,
19:32:45  BUT IF NOT, WE'LL BE
SURE TO -- I
19:32:49  THINK -- I KNOW WE'VE HEARD FROM OUR SUPERVISORS
19:32:52 
 AND I'D BE HAPPY TO SHARE THAT TOO.

19:32:55 WE WOULD LIKE MORE PEOPLE, AS ALWAYS, TO BE ENGAGED AND WE
19:32:58 
APPRECIATE THE EFFORTS THAT WERE PUT FORTH
19:33:02  FROM AMANDA, OUR
CITY TEAM AND YOUR TEAM AT THE COUNTY LEVEL TO ENSURE
19:33:04  THAT
PEOPLE PARTICIPATED IN CENSUS PROCESS.

19:33:13 NEXT ON OUR AGENDA ITEM, LET ME SEE IF THERE'S -- OKAY,
WE'RE
19:33:16  OKAY RIGHT NOW FOR A BREAK, WE DON'T NEED A BREAK
RIGHT NOW, BUT THERE
19:33:20  IS -- NEXT IS ITEM 5A, WHICH IS
19:33:23  THE
HIGH STREET DEMOLITION APPEAL
19:33:26 .
OUR SENIOR PLANNER,
19:33:29  BILL ROTH, WILL BE PROVIDING US WITH A
STAFF PRESENTATION THIS
19:33:33  EVENING.
WELCOME.

19:33:37 NICE TO SEE YOU, MR. ROTH.

19:33:41 >>
19:33:44  GOOD EVENING.
THE ITEM BEFORE YOU IS THE CONSIDERATION OF AN APPEAL OF
19:33:50  TWO
PLANNING MANAGER DETERMINATIONS THAT WERE UPHELD BY H
19:33:53 ARB ON
A APPEAL.
THE SUBJECT PROPERTY AT
19:33:58  40871 HIGH STREET IN THE IRVINGTON
DISTRICT IS A POTENTIAL
19:34:01  HISTORIC REGISTER RESOURCE, AND TWO,
THERE IS INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE TO
19:34:04  SUPPORT EMERGENCY
DEMOLITION OF AN EXISTING BARN ON THE
19:34:07  PROPERTY, PICTURED
HERE.
IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT
19:34:10  THE CITY'S HISTORIC RESOURCES
ORDINANCE LIMITS THE PLANNING
19:34:14  MANAGER'S PURVIEW IN
DETERMINING WHAT IS OR IS NOT A
19:34:17  POTENTIAL REGISTER RESOURCE.
PER THE CODE, A HISTORIC
19:34:21  EVALUATION RECEIVED BY A QUALIFIED
HISTORIC PRESERVATION
19:34:24  PROFESSIONAL IS THE BASIS FOR THAT
DETERMINATION.
HOWEVER
19:34:28 , ON APPEAL, PER FREMONT MUNICIPAL
19:34:31  CODE SECTION, THE
CITY COUNCIL IS NOT BOUND BY
19:34:34  THAT DECISION OR LIMITED TO THE
ISSUES RAISED ON APPEAL.

19:34:38 THE CITY COUNCIL CAN CONSIDER THE FULL BODY OF EVIDENCE IN
MAKING THEIR
19:34:41  DECISION TONIGHT, WHICH INCLUDES A SECOND
HISTORIC EVALUATION
19:34:44  PROVIDED BY THE APPLICANT'S CONSULTANT,
THAT IS INCLUDED IN
19:34:51  THE AGENDA PACKET, AND DISCUSSED IN THE
STAFF REPORT
19:34:51 .
AND BRIEFLY IN THIS  PRESENTATION.

19:34:59 THIS IS AN AERIAL --
>> Ms. Gauthier: I'M SORRY
19:35:02  TO INTERRUPT, MR. ROTH.
WE'RE NOT SEEING YOUR PRESENTATION
19:35:05 .
>> Mayor Mei: I WAS GOING TO
19:35:09  SAY THAT TOO.
I APOLOGIZE, THANK YOU.
>> Ms. Gauthier: DO YOU NEED US
19:35:12  TO SCREEN SHARE YOUR
PRESENTATION?

19:35:15 >> THANK YOU FOR STOPPING ME THERE.
I APOLOGIZE.

19:35:18 >> Ms. Gauthier: YES.
SORRY TO INTERRUPT.
I WANTED TO MAKE SURE WE HAD IT UP
19:35:21 .
>> CAN YOU SEE IT NOW?
>> Ms. Gauthier: YES, WE CAN, THANK 
19:35:23 YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: YES.
THANK YOU.

19:35:26 >> THANK YOU FOR GETTING ME THERE.
SO THIS WAS THE FIRST SLIDE, JUST
19:35:29  SHOWING THE BARN.

19:35:32 AND HERE'S THE SECOND SLIDE.
SO THIS IS AN AERIAL OF THE APPROXIMATELY
19:35:36  1.23-ACRE 
PROPERTY.

19:35:39 WHEN VIEWED FROM THE STREET, THE SUBJECT BARN BUILT AROUND
19:35:43 
1910 IS AT THE REAR OF AN EXISTING HOUSE BUILT IN 19 THRRT
19:35:46 
EIGHT AND NEAR AN EXISTING TANKHOUSE ALREADY BUILT AROUND
19:35:49 
1910.
HERE ARE PHOTOS OF THE SOUTHERN
19:35:53  ELEVATIONS OF THE BARN.
FOR BACKGROUND, STAFF WAS ORIGINALLY
19:35:56  APPROACHED WITH A
REQUEST TO REMOVE THE BARN IN ORDER TO
19:35:59  FACILITATE 
REDEVELOPMENT OF THE PROPERTY WITH A CO-HOUSING
19:36:03  CONCEPT,
WHICH THE APPLICANT TEAM WILL LIKELY ELABORATE ON IN
19:36:06  THEIR
PRESENTATION.
FOLLOWING THE
19:36:09  PROCEDURES  OUTLINED IN THE CITY MANAGER
MARK DANAJ'S ORDINANCE, STAFF SCREENED 
19:36:12 THE PROPERTY FOR
HISTORIC SIGNIFICANCE AND OBTAINED A HISTORIC RESOURCES
19:36:15 
INVENTORY MENTIONED BEFORE, ALSO CALLED A DPR FORM, WHICH

19:36:19 WAS PREPARED BY HISTORIC RESOURCES CONSULTANT
19:36:23 , WHICH
CONCLUDED THAT THE SUBJECT PROPERTY AS A WHOLE WAS A

19:36:26 POTENTIAL HISTORIC RESOURCE, AS A
19:36:29  RARE SURVIVING EXAMPLE OF
A FARM STEAD IN FREMONT.
A
19:36:32  POTENTIAL REGISTER RESOURCE MEANS A BUILDING, STRUCTURE,
OBJECT
19:36:36 , SITE, AREA OR PLACE IDENTIFIED BY A QUALIFIED
19:36:39 
HISTORIC PRESERVATION PROFESSIONAL AS MEETING THE STANDARDS

19:36:42 FOR LISTING IN THE CALIFORNIA REGISTER OR FREMONT
19:36:46  REGISTER.

19:36:50 THESE ARE PHOTOS OF THE BARN'S NORTH FACADES.
THEY
19:36:53  CONCLUDED THAT THE BARN AND THE TANKHOUSE ARE, QUOTE,
RARE
19:36:56  SURVIVING EXAMPLES OF AGRICULTURAL BUILDING TYPES THAT
WERE
19:36:59  COMMON ON DOMESTIC AGRICULTURAL PROPERTIES IN FREMONT
THROUGH
19:37:02  THE MID 20TH CENTURY.
ALTHOUGH THE
19:37:05  EXISTING HOUSE IS NOT THE ORIGINAL FARMHOUSE
AROUND WHICH THE BARN AND TANKHOUSE
19:37:09  WERE LIKELY BUILT, THAT
19:37:12 
STATES THAT THE PROPERTY AS A WHOLE IS REPRESENTATIVE OF ITS
19:37:15 
ORIGINAL AGRICULTURAL USE, AND ALLIANCE WITH THE BROAD
19:37:19 ER
CONTEXT OF AGRICULTURE IN FREMONT AND THAT
19:37:22 , QUOTE, 4081 HIGH
STREET RETAIN
19:37:25 S SUFFICIENT INTEGRITY TO CONVEY
19:37:28  ITS
SIGNIFICANCE UNDER CRITERION  C3 AND THEREFORE QUALIFIES

19:37:32 FOR LISTING ON LOCAL STATE AND HISTORIC RECOMMENDING
19:37:35  SISTERS.
THAT DEPARTMENT OF INTERIOR CRITERION, C
19:37:38 3, PERTAINS TO
ARCHITECTURAL ELIGIBILITY FOR THE NATIONAL AND
19:37:41  STATE
REGISTERS RESPECTIVELY.

19:37:47 THE CITY'S HISTORIC
19:37:52  REGISTER CAN BE APPEALED TO HARB
19:37:55 , WHICH
THE APPLICANTS DID, THEY SUPPORTED THEIR APPEAL
19:37:58  WITH A DPR
FROM THEIR OWN HISTORIC RESOURCES
19:38:01  CONSULTANT WHICH CONCLUDED
THAT, QUOTE, THE BUILDING AND STRUCTURES ON THE PROPERTY
19:38:04  ARE
COMMON FORMS OF SMALL AGRICULTURE TOORL OPERATIONS AND ARE
19:38:07 
BETTER REPRESENTED IN
19:38:11  OTHER HISTORICALLY DESIGNATED SITES,
AND THAT THE
19:38:14  PROPERTY DOES NOT MEET THE CRITERIA FOR
SIGNIFICANCE
19:38:17  THAT IS REQUIRED FOR ELIGIBILITY FOR HISTORIC
REGISTER LISTING
19:38:20 .
THEIR APPEAL ALSO QUESTIONS WHETHER THE
19:38:23  PROPERTY WAS
ACTUALLY USED AS A FARM STEAD
19:38:26  STEAD AFTER THE NEW HOUSE ON
THE PROPERTY WAS CONSTRUCTED IN
19:38:29  1938, COUNTERING A STATEMENT
IN THE
19:38:33  DPR THAT ORCHARD CANNING AK
19:38:36  TIFLT CONTINUED ON THE
PROPERTY THROUGH THE 1950s.
HARB
19:38:39  CONSIDERED THE APPEAL BUT TOOK NO ACTION REGARDING THE
DETERMINATION THAT THE PROPERTY
19:38:42  IS A POTENTIAL REGISTER
 RESOURCE.
THAT
19:38:45  INACTION BY HARB IS CONSIDERED A DENIAL OF THE
APPLICANT'S
19:38:49  APPEAL, EFFECTIVELY AFFIRMING THE PLANNING
MANAGER'S DETERMINATION THAT
19:38:52  THE PROPERTY IS A POTENTIAL
REGISTER RESOURCE
19:38:55  RESOURCE.
THAT DECISION IS NOW BEING
19:38:58  APPEALED TONIGHT.
THE APPLICANT HAS
19:39:01  ALSO FILED AN APPEAL OF A PLANNING MANAGER
DETERMINATION THAT THERE IS 
19:39:06 INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE TO WARRANT
EMERGENCY DEMOLITION OF THE
19:39:09   BARN.
THE CITY'S HISTORIC RESOURCES ORDINANCE PROVIDES A
19:39:12  PROCESS
FOR EMERGENCY DEMOLITION OF REGISTER RESOURCES
19:39:16  AND POTENTIAL
HISTORIC REGISTER
19:39:19  RESOURCES WHEN IMMEDIATE OR POTENTIAL
HAZARDOUS
19:39:22  CONDITIONS ARE PRESENT TO OTHER BUILDINGS
19:39:26 ,
OCCUPANTS, OR TO PLANT OR ANIMAL LIFE ON THE SAME OR
19:39:29 
ADJACENT PROPERTY, AND DEMOLITION IS THE ONLY FEASIBLE

19:39:32 OPTION FOR ADDRESSING THAT HAZARD.
THE APPLICANT HAD A
19:39:35  STRUCTURAL ENGINEER PROVIDE A LETTER
DATED IN JUNE OF LAST
19:39:39  YEAR STATING THAT, QUOTE, THE
BUILDING POSSESSES A SIGNIFICANT
19:39:42  RISK TO LIFE SAFETY, AND,
QUOTE, IT IS HIGHLY
19:39:45  LIKELY THE BUILD
19:39:48 
WOULD COLLAPSE DURING A SIGNIFICANT OR SEISMIC EVENT.

19:39:52 AS REQUIRED PER THE ORANGES THE PLANNING MANAGER CONSULTED
19:39:55 
WITH THE CITY'S CHIEF BUILDING OFFICIAL, WHO WENT OUT AND

19:39:58 INSPECTED THE BARN IN APRIL OF THIS YEAR, AND FOUND THAT IT
DID NOT
19:40:01  PRESENT AN EMERGENCY HAZARDOUS CONDITION.
SUBSEQUENTLY
19:40:04 , THE PLANNING MANAGER DETERMINED THAT
INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE
19:40:08  EXISTED THIS TIME TO WARRANT EMERGENCY
REMOVAL OF
19:40:11  THIS POTENTIAL HISTORIC REGISTER RESOURCE.

19:40:15 HARB TOOK ACTION TO UPHOLD THE PLANNING MANAGER'S

19:40:18  DETERMINATION, AND THAT ACTION WAS ALSO
APPEALED TO
19:40:21  COUNCIL THAT WE HAVE TONIGHT.

19:40:26 IN SUMMARY, THE KEY QUESTIONS BEFORE THE CITY COUNCIL THIS
EVENING ARE
19:40:29 , ONE, DOES THE EVIDENCE IN THE RECORD SUPPORT
THE
19:40:32  CONCLUSION THAT THE SUBJECT PROPERTY IS A POTENTIAL
HISTORIC RESOURCE?

19:40:36 AS DOCUMENTED IN THE PAGE AND TRUM
19:40:39 BELL DPR, OR IS THERE
ENOUGH
19:40:43  CONTROVERTING EVIDENCE-BASED ON THE PROGRAMMER'S DP
19:40:46 R
AND TESTIMONY, WHEREAS IN THE COUNCIL'S JUDGMENT,
19:40:49  IT
WAS INCORRECT TO CONCLUDE THE PROPERTY IS A POTENTIAL

19:40:53 HISTORIC RESOURCE.
IF THE COUNCIL CONCLUDES THE PROPERTY IS A POTENTIAL
19:40:56 
REGISTER RESOURCE, THE
19:40:59  SECOND QUESTION BEFORE COUNCIL IS
WHETHER EMERGENCY DEMOLITION OF THE BARN IS WARRANTED
19:41:03 .
MORE SPECIFICALLY, QUESTIONS 2A AND 2B ON THIS
19:41:06  SLIDE, IS IT
AN IMMEDIATE HAZARD, AND IS DEMOLITION THE
19:41:10  ONLY FEASIBLE
ACTION THAT CAN BE TAKEN TO ADDRESS THAT HAZARD
19:41:13 ?
THE COUNCIL MUST BE ABLE TO ANSWER BOTH
19:41:17  2A AND 2B IN THE
AFFIRMATIVE TO BE ABLE TO AUTHORIZE EMERGENCY
19:41:20  DEMOLITION
19:41:24 .
IS IT AN MEDIAL
19:41:27  OR POTENTIAL HAZARD, IS DEMOLITION THE
ONLY FEASIBLE ACTION
19:41:30  TO ADDRESS THE HAZARD?
THE COUNCIL SHOULD USE ITS
19:41:33  JUDGMENT IN ANSWERING THESE
QUESTIONS, BASED ON WHATEVER THE COUNCIL
19:41:36  DECIDES WITH REGARD
TO THESE QUESTIONS, THE RECOMMENDATION
19:41:40  SECTIONS OF THE STAFF
REPORT CONTAIN THE SPECIFIC
19:41:43  ELEMENTS OF A MOTION.
WHENEVER COUNCIL IS READY TO
19:41:46  MAKE A MOTION, STAFF CAN ASSIST
IF NEEDED IN POINTING
19:41:50  THE DIFFERENT ALTERNATIVES IN THAT
RECOMMENDATION SECTION.
THIS CONCLUDE
19:41:53 'S STAFF'S PRESENTATION.
STAFF IS AVAILABLE TO ANSWER QUESTION
19:41:56 S
19:42:00  THAT THE COUNCIL MAY
HAVE.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU
19:42:03 .
SO AT THIS TIME,
19:42:07  I'M GOING TO TURN IT BACK TO THE
COUNCIL FOR ANY CLARIFYING QUESTIONS.

19:42:16 SEEING NONE, WE'RE GOING TO GO TO THE APPELLANT
19:42:19  ALSO HAS A
PRESENTATION.

19:42:25 IF WE COULD GIVE THEM 10 MINUTES, IF WE COULD START THE
19:42:28 
TIMER, THAT WOULD BE GREAT.
I BELIEVE MAKING THE
19:42:31  PRESENTATION TONIGHT WILL BE JANE
MUELLER, REPRESENTING URBAN
19:42:34  PROGRAMMERS.
JANE, WELL KO.
19:42:38 
>> JUST TO CLARIFY, I AM NOT
19:42:41  REPRESENTING URBAN PROGRAMMERS.
I AM ONE OF THE FOUNDING MEMBERS
19:42:44  OF A GROUP THAT CALLS
ITSELF MISSION PEAK VILLAGE.
I'M ONE OF
19:42:47  TWO PEOPLE WHO WILL BE SPEAKING TO YOU WITH
REGARD TO PROPERTY
19:42:52  OWNER'S OWE PEEL OF THE AUGUST
19:42:53 
DETERMINATION LETTER HE RECEIVED FROM THE PLANNING MANAGER

19:42:56 AND THE OTHER PERSON IS FROM URBAN PROGRAMMERS.
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY
19:43:00 .
>> YOU'VE DOUBTLESS READ IN YOUR
19:43:03  PACT THE APPEAL.
HE MENTIONS IN THAT LETTER
19:43:06  THAT HE HAS A PENDING CONTRACT
WITH A PROSPECTIVE
19:43:10  BUYER, A GROUP HE DESCRIBES AS COMPOSED
PRIMARILY OF FREMONT
19:43:13  RESIDENTS WHO HOPE TO DEVELOP THE SITE
AS AN
19:43:16  INNOVATIVE CONDOMINIUM COMPLEX WHERE THEY THEMSELVES
WILL LIVE
19:43:20 .
MISSION PEAK VILLAGE IS THAT GROUP.

19:43:23 WE COUNT AMONG US, INCIDENTALLY, SEVERAL
19:43:26  PEOPLE WHO ARE
MEMBERS OF THE
19:43:29  MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY INCLUDING ME.
WE HOPE TO PURCHASE THE PROPERTY AND 
19:43:32 IN ALIGNMENT WITH
CURRENT ZONING, BUILD A COMMUNITY TO
19:43:36  LIVE IN THAT WOULD
ACCOMMODATE ABOUT 32 HOUSEHOLDS, INCLUDING
19:43:39  THREE BELOW
MARKET RATE UNITS.

19:43:43 OUR PURCHASE CONTRACT IS CONTINGENT UPON CITY APPROVAL OF
19:43:46 
HIS PERMIT APPLICATION TO DECONSTRUCT THE BARN
19:43:49 .
COMMUNITIES LIKE THE ONE WE PLAN ARE CALL
19:43:53 ED COLLABORATIVE
HOUSING OR CO HOUSING.

19:43:56 WE ARE MULTIGENERATIONAL AND MULTICULTURAL,
19:44:00  AND SINGULARLY
FOCUSED ON THE IDEA OF INTENTIONAL COMMUNITY
19:44:03 .
WE WANT TO CREATE AND LIVE IN A NEIGHBORHOOD WHERE NEIGHBORS

19:44:07 ARE FRIENDS, WHERE YOUNG AND OLD PEOPLE PLAY TOGETHER
19:44:10  AND
SUPPORT EACH OTHER, WHERE WE INTERACT FREQUENTLY AND MAYBE

19:44:14 HAVE MEALS TOGETHER A FEW TIMES A WEEK.
THERE ARE MORE THAN A DOZEN
19:44:18  CO HOUSING COMMUNITIES IN THE
BAY AREA BUT NONE YET IN FREMONT.
THE HOUSING
19:44:21  ELEMENT OF FREMONT'S GENERAL PLAN ACTUALLY CALL
19:44:25 S
OUT THE CO HOUSING CONCEPT AS A DESIRABLE ADDITION THOUGH
19:44:27  TO
THE  HOUSING MIX.
OUR GROUP HOPES
19:44:30  TO BE THE FIRST TO FINALLY INTRODUCE CO
HOUSING TO FREMONT.

19:44:33 MISSION PEAK VILLAGE HAS  RETAINED WELL-KNOWN CO
HOUSING
19:44:37  PIONEER KATHRYN McHAMMOND AS OUR
19:44:40  ADVISOR.
BRAD
19:44:43  GUNKEL, PRINCIPAL OF THE FIRM, IS NOT ONLY
19:44:46  EXPERIENCED
IN DESIGNING CO HOUSING  COMMUNITIES, HE'S

19:44:49 EXPERIENCED IN LIVING IN THEM AS WELL.

19:44:53 THE CITY PLANNING MANAGER'S DETERMINATION LETTER
19:44:56  SAID IN
PART THAT THE SETTING OF THE EXISTING BUILDINGS
19:44:59  ON THE
PROPERTY CONSTITUTED A POTENTIAL HISTORICAL RESOURCE, THE

19:45:02 WHOLE SETTING.
AS YOU KNOW, THE SELLER APPEALED THAT
19:45:06  DETERMINATION TO HARB
LAST MONTH AND HARB WAS UNABLE TO TAKE
19:45:09  ACTION AND CONCLUDE
THAT THE WHOLE SETTING WAYS HISTORIC AND WORTHY
19:45:12  OF
PRESERVATION.
BUT IF THE
19:45:16  SETTING AS A WHOLE MUST BE PRESERVED, THE SITE
WILL BE UNUSABLE
19:45:19  FOR OUR PURPOSE.
IN OTHER WORDS, IF COUNCIL VOTES TO
19:45:22  REJECT THE SELLER'S
APPEAL, WE WILL NOT PURCHASE THE PROPERTY
19:45:25 .
AS HISTORY MAKING A
19:45:29  SITE AS IT COULD BECOME.
ON THE OTHER HAND, WE HAVE DISCOVERED FROM
19:45:32  TALKING WITH
19:45:35  --
THAT IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO HAVE THE BARN DECONSTRUCTED IN

19:45:38 SUCH A WAY THAT SOME OF THE WOOD COULD BE REPURPOSED,
 MAYBE
19:45:41  EVEN USED IN OUR BUILDING SOMEHOW.

19:45:44 OUR ARCHITECT SEES POSSIBILITIES IN THAT TOO.
WE'VE EVEN HAD
19:45:48  AN EXPLORATORY INQUIRY FROM PEOPLE PLANNING A
19:45:51 
RESTORATION PROJECT AT SHINN PARK ABOUT REPURPOSING SOME OF

19:45:54 THAT WOOD.
IT TOOK
19:45:57  SEVEN YEARS OF SEARCHING FOR AND ATTEMPTING TO BUY
19:46:00  A
SITE BEFORE WE CAME TO A MEETING OF THE MINDS WITH THIS

19:46:03 PROPERTY OWNER.
BUT UNLESS YOU
19:46:06  UPHOLD HIS APPEAL, WE CAN'T BUILD CO HOUSING
THERE
19:46:10 .
WE CAN SAY FROM LONG,
19:46:13  HARD EXPERIENCE, I PROMISE YOU, THAT
WE ARE UNLIKELY TO FIND ANOTHER
19:46:16  SITE THAT WOULD WORK.

19:46:19 IT WILL END OUR ENDEAVOR TO INTRODUCE CO HOUSING AS
19:46:21  AN
APPROACH TO MEETING FREMONT'S HOUSING NEED, IN FACT, IT WILL

19:46:25 END OUR ENDEAVOR PERIOD.
BUT IN THE LARGER CONTEXT
19:46:28 , AS A LONG TIME RESIDENT OF
FREMONT AND A CONSTITUENT WHO
19:46:31  ELECTS CITY COUNCIL TO BE THE
STEWARDS OF OUR LAND USE, I ASK YOU
19:46:34  TO CONSIDER THE MOST
EFFECTIVE USE OF THIS PARCEL
19:46:37 .
IT SITS IN A RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD OF MOSTLY MULTIFAMILY
19:46:40 
DWELLINGS.
IT'S INCONSISTENT WITH ITS 
19:46:43 SURROUNDINGS AND HIGHLY
QUESTIONABLE IN ITS HISTORIC VALUE
19:46:46 .
AS YOU EMBARK ON YOUR HOUSING
19:46:49  UPDATE WORK ON OUR CITY'S
 BEHALF, PLEASE THINK ABOUT WHETHER
19:46:53  32 UNITS OF
HOUSING INCLUDING BMR UNITS IS A
19:46:56  FAR MORE APPROPRIATE USE OF
THIS SITE.

19:46:59 SO NOW I WILL INTRODUCE TO YOU THE
19:47:03  SECOND SPEAKER.
AS YOU READ IN MR. MOSETTI'S
19:47:06  LETTER, WHEN STAFF ELECTED NOT
TO HAVE THE PAGE AND TURN
19:47:09 BULL REPORT PEER REVIEWED, HE
RETAINED A FIRM HIMSELF TO
19:47:12  PERFORM THE REVIEW.
AMONG THE QUALIFIED
19:47:16  FIRMS WHOSE EXPERIENCE ALREADY INCLUDED
ANALYSES IN FREMONT WAS URBAN 
19:47:20 PROGRAMMERS, A HIGHLY REGARDED
FIRM WITH CREDENTIALS AS
19:47:23  CONSULTANTS FOR CULTURAL RESOURCE
EVALUATION STUDIES AND
19:47:26  HISTORIC PRESERVATION.
SO PLEASE MEET THE PRESIDENT OF URBAN PROGRAMMER
19:47:29 S, BONNIE
19:47:32  BRAM
19:47:42   BAMBURG.
>> Ms. Gauthier: WE HAVE FIVE MINUTES
19:47:45  20 SECONDS LEFT.
>> Mayor Mei: GREAT.
WELCOME, BONNIE.

19:47:48 YOU'RE ALSO ON MUTE.
I APOLOGIZE.
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU REALIZE  THAT.

19:47:59 YOU'RE STILL ON MUTE.
I'M SORRY.
THERE.

19:48:02 >> IS THAT WORKING?
THANK YOU.
>> Ms. Gauthier: I'M SORRY TO
19:48:05  INTERRUPT, MS. BAMBURG.
WILL YOU BE SHARING YOUR
19:48:08  SCREEN OR DO YOU NEED US TO DO THAT?
>> I BELIEVE THAT THE
19:48:12  SLIDES HAVE BEEN SENT TO YOU TO BE
ABLE TO SHARE.

19:48:14 >> Ms. Gauthier: OKAY.
JUST WANTED TO FIND OUT WHO WAS SHARING.

19:48:17 SO IF YOU CAN GIVE ME JUST A MOMENT, PLEASE.

19:48:24 >> WHILE YOU'RE GETTING THAT TOGETHER, THE SLIDES ARE
19:48:27  REALLY
JUST A
19:48:30  BRIEF PART OF THE REPORT THAT WE HAD TURNED IN
PREVIOUSLY
19:48:33  PREVIOUSLY.
AND I WANTED TO INTRODUCE MYSELF JUST A LITTLE BIT
19:48:37  MORE.
I HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN
19:48:40   EVALUATING HISTORIC
PROPERTIES IN THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY
19:48:43  AREA FOR OVER 40 YEARS.
AND
19:48:46  IN THE PAST, WORKING IN THE CITY OF FREMONT
19:48:49 , SEVERAL
YEARS AGO, WE DID A DRIVE-
19:48:53 AROUND SURVEY TO LOOK FOR
19:48:56  BARNS,
TANKHOUSE AND VARIOUS OTHER REMNANTS OF
19:48:59  THE PAST HISTORY OF
THE VILLAGES THAT CAME TOGETHER
19:49:02  TO BE FREMONT.
AND I WILL TELL YOU
19:49:07  WE FOUND MANY, MANY EXAMPLES.
I THINK WHEN
19:49:10  FREMONT INCORPORATED AND BROUGHT THE VILLAGES
19:49:14 
TOGETHER, THERE WAS SO MUCH AGRICULTURAL LAND IN BETWEEN
19:49:18 
THAT AS THE SUBDIVISION STARTED,
19:49:21  REMNANTS OF THESE
ACTIVITIES SORT OF
19:49:24  REMAIN IN PIECES AND IN PARTS THROUGHOUT
DIFFERENT SUBDIVISIONS
19:49:27 .
I'M SURE YOU'VE ALL SEEN THEM THROUGHOUT THE CITY.

19:49:33 WHEN WE WERE BEFORE THE HARB BOARD -- LET ME
19:49:37  BACK UP AND
JUST TELL YOU THAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT
19:49:40  TWO REPORT.
BOTH QUALIFIED HISTORICAL CONSULTANTS
19:49:44 , BUT WITH A DIFFERENT
CONCLUSION.
AND HOW CAN THAT BE?

19:49:47 WELL, THERE'S A NUMBER OF  REASONS, BUT
19:49:51  TWO THAT ARE
MOST COMMON
19:49:54  IS THAT ONE CONSULTANT HAS MAYBE A
BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE
19:49:57  OVERALL GENERAL AREA, AND THERE
MAY BE RESEARCH
19:50:00  THAT ONE OR THE OTHER FINDS CREDIBLE OR
NOT.

19:50:06 SO THAT'S TYPICALLY THE REASONS WHY YOU WOULD HAVE
19:50:09  A
DIFFERENCE OF OPINION.
AND THE CONCLUSION
19:50:12 .

19:50:16 BEFORE THE HARB BOARD, IT WAS QUESTION
19:50:20 ED WHETHER OR
NOT ONE BUILDING, POSSIBLY THE BARN, COULD BE
19:50:23  SEPARATED AND
THUS BE A HISTORICAL
19:50:26  RESOURCE, AND I WANT TO TELL YOU THAT
19:50:30 
THE BUILDINGS ON THE SITE REALLY
19:50:34  ARE A COMMON STYLE OR
SEVERELY ALTER
19:50:37 ED AS IN THE CASE OF THIS HOUSE THAT
19:50:40  HAS HAD
ITS WHOLE FRONT WALLED IN AND
19:50:43  COMPLETELY CHANGED ITS
CHARACTER
19:50:47 , TO THE FACT THAT THE BARN HAS HAD
19:50:50  RECONSTRUCTION,
AND THAT ISN'T
19:50:54  RECONSTRUCTIVE, IS IN PRETTY
19:50:57  POOR CONDITION.
SO INDIVIDUALLY
19:51:00 , I THINK WE HAVE TO LOOK AT BOTH REPORT AND
SAY THIS
19:51:04  IS A REPORT OF THIS
19:51:07  SITE, RATHER THAN BEING ABLE TO
SEPARATE THEM.

19:51:12 WHEN WE LOOKED AT THE
19:51:15  CONCEPT OF A FARMSTEAD, ONE OF THE
THINGS
19:51:18  THAT'S GENERALLY IMPORTANT TO HAVE IN A FARMSTEAD
19:51:22  IS
A  HOMESTEAD.
WE
19:51:25  COULD FIND NO EVIDENCE OF A HOUSE ON
19:51:28  THE PROPERTY PRIOR
TO 1938.

19:51:33 AND AFTER 1938, WE COULD NOT FIND
19:51:36  EVIDENCE THAT ACTUALLY
19:51:39  
CANNING DID GO ON ON THE SITE.
WE DID FIND EVIDENCE THAT THERE WAS
19:51:42  A SMALL APRICOT
19:51:50  -- AND
THAT APRICOTS WERE AVAILABLE, BUT THAT IS
19:51:53  NOT THE SAME THING
AS CREATING A SIGNIFICANT  FARMSTEAD, HOME
19:51:56 STEAD
THAT CAN COMMUNICATE ITS STORY TO
19:51:59  PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT
FAMILIAR WITH IT.

19:52:02 SO THAT'S HOW WE CAME TO A DIFFERENT CONCLUSION
19:52:06  THAN THE
PAGE AND TURNBULL REPORT, AND WE HAD
19:52:09  SOME YEARS LATER THE
ABILITY TO DO A LITTLE
19:52:12  BIT MORE RESEARCH MAYBE THAN THEY HAD
HAD AT
19:52:15  THAT TIME.
SO I HOPE THAT CAN HELP YOU UNDERSTAND HOW YOU
19:52:18  CAN HAVE TWO
CONFLICTING OPINIONS
19:52:22  AND STILL HAVE CREDIBLE CONSULTANTS.

19:52:27 SO GOING FORWARD,
19:52:30  I FIRST WANT TO COMPLIMENT
19:52:34  THE CITY OF
FREMONT.
AS THE COMMUNITIES CAME
19:52:37   TOGETHER, AND THE HISTORY
OF THE CITY WAS CHANGING AND
19:52:40  GOING IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION,
19:52:43 
THERE WAS FORESIGHT TO PRESERVE THE ARDENWOOD
19:52:46  FARM, THE
SHINN HISTORIC PARK
19:52:49 , THE -- AND DAVIS HOUSE WHICH
19:52:53  IS JUST
DOWN THE BLOCK ON HIGH STREET, AND THE
19:52:56  CALIFORNIA NURSERY,
AMONG  OTHERS.

19:53:01 THOSE ARE WONDERFUL, WONDERFUL SITES
19:53:04 .
THEY'RE
19:53:07  COMPLETE IN THEIR SETTING AND THEY COMMUNICATE WHAT
THEIR
19:53:11  PREVIOUS USE WAS AND HOW
19:53:14  THEY FUNCTIONED, HOW THEY
FUNCTIONED IS REALLY AN
19:53:17  IMPORTANT PART OF UNDERSTANDING THE
HISTORY OF SOMETHING.

19:53:25 SO WITH THAT, I WOULD BE GLAD TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU
MIGHT HAVE REGARDING
19:53:29  OUR REPORT AND
19:53:33  I WON'T SPEAK FOR PAGE
AND TURNBULL BUT I'M VERY FAMILIAR WITH THEIR REPORT
19:53:36  AS WELL.
>> Mayor Mei: AGAIN, AT THIS TIME, I'D LIKE TO SEE IF
19:53:38 
THERE'S ANY CLARIFYING QUESTIONS FROM THE COUNCILMEMBERS.

19:53:46 OKAY.
SEEING NONE, I'D LIKE TO
19:53:50  SEE -- COUNCILMEMBER
19:53:53  KASSAN --
COUNCILMEMBER JONES FIRST ACTUALLY.

19:53:57 >> Councilmember Jones: THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR.
AND THANK YOU, JANE AND
19:54:00  BONNIE, FOR THE PRESENTATIONS.

19:54:03 JUST A QUICK QUESTION.
SO THE
19:54:07  OVERALL SITE, IN YOUR VIEW, BONNIE, IS NO LONGER
19:54:11 
HISTORICAL BECAUSE OF THE NEWER AGE
19:54:14  OF THE FARMHOUSE AND THE
FACT THAT IT HAS BEEN REMODELED
19:54:17  SEVERAL TIMES.
DOES THAT ALSO APPLY TO -- IT LOOKS
19:54:21  LIKE THERE'S BEEN
EXTENSIVE REMODELING TO THE BARN.
>> YES,
19:54:24  AND WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE OVERALL SITE,
19:54:27  AS A
FARMSTEAD OR HOME
19:54:30 STEAD, IT'S A COMPLETE UNIT, AND THAT SITE
IS NOT A COMPLETE UNIT.

19:54:35 IN OUR OPINION.
>> Councilmember Jones: AND THAT'S BASED
19:54:38  ON THE NUMBER OF
ALTERATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN DONE OVER THE YEARS, IS THAT

19:54:41 CORRECT?
>> THE NUMBER OF ALTERATIONS AND THE DIFFERENCES
19:54:45  IN THE TIME
PERIODS BETWEEN
19:54:48  THE HOUSE AND THE OTHER AGRICULTURAL
 BUILDINGS.

19:54:52 >> Councilmember Jones: OKAY.
THANK YOU.
AND FOR MR. ROTH
19:54:55 , IS THERE ANYTHING THAT WOULD PREVENT THE
CURRENT OWNER FROM TAKING
19:54:58  THE STRUCTURE DOWN IF HE DECIDED
NOT
19:55:01  TO SELL THE PROPERTY?

19:55:05 >> WELL, BECAUSE WE HAVE THE
19:55:08  FIRST DPR IN FROM THE HISTORIC
CONSULTANT
19:55:12  PAGE AND TURNBULL STATING THAT THE PROPERTY IS A
POTENTIAL
19:55:15  REGISTER RESOURCE, THEN IT BENEFITS FROM THE
19:55:19 
PROTECTION OF POTENTIAL OR REGISTER RESOURCE
19:55:22  FOR THE CITY'S
HISTORIC RESOURCES ORDINANCE.
SO AS IT IS RIGHT NOW
19:55:25 , BASED ON THAT DECISION WHICH
19:55:28  WAS
UPHELD BY HARB, KIND OF AS WE ARE AT THIS
19:55:31  PRESENT TIME TODAY,
19:55:35 
 THEY WOULD HAVE TO MEET THE FINDINGS FOR IMMEDIATE OR
19:55:39 
PROMPT EMERGENCY DEMOLITION IN THE HISTORIC RESOURCES
19:55:42 
ORDINANCE.
IF COUNCIL WERE TO DECIDE
19:55:45  TONIGHT THAT IT IS NOT A POTENTIAL
REGISTER RESOURCE, THEN THEY DON'T NEED
19:55:48  TO MEET THOSE
EMERGENCY DEMOLITION REQUIREMENTS IN THE HISTORIC RESOURCES
19:55:51 
ORDINANCE.
THEY WOULD JUST WORK THROUGH THE 
19:55:55 BUILDING DEPARTMENT FOR A
MINISTERIAL DEMOLITION PERMIT, AS WOULD SOMEBODY
19:55:58  FOR ANY
OTHER STRUCTURE THAT ISN'T
19:56:01  A HISTORIC RESOURCE OR
19:56:03  POTENTIAL
HISTORIC RESOURCE.
>> Councilmember Jones: THANK YOU.

19:56:07 YOU ACTUALLY ANSWERED MY NEXT QUESTION THERE ABOUT IF IT WAS
NOT DEEMED TO
19:56:10  BE HISTORICAL, THEN THE EMERGENCY DEMOLITION
PO OF
19:56:13  PORTION OF IT WOULD KIND
19:56:16  OF BECOME A
MOOT POINT, CORRECT?
>> 
19:56:20 YES, THAT'S CORRECT.
>> I KNOW THERE WAS SOME QUESTION
19:56:23  ABOUT WHETHER IT WAS SAFE
AND HAD TO COME DOWN IMMEDIATELY.

19:56:26 WAS THAT BASED ON WHETHER THE BUILDING WAS INHABITED OR NOT?

19:56:31 >> SO IT WAS THE APPLICANT
19:56:34 , THE AP LENT THAT HIRED A
STRUCTURAL ENGINEER
19:56:37  TO PROVIDE THAT LETTER BACK IN JUNE,
WHICH IS INCLUDED IN THE YOU
19:56:41  AGENDA PACKET, AND IT MAKES
THOSE QUOTES THAT I BROUGHT
19:56:44  UP IN THE STAFF REPORT ABOUT IT
BEING
19:56:47  IN DANGER OF COLLAPSE DUE TO WIND OR SEISMIC EVENT
19:56:50 .

19:56:54 I DON'T, IN SHORT, KNOW ALL THAT THEY
19:56:58  ENGINEER, THAT THE
STRUCTURAL ENGINEER CONSIDERED.

19:57:01 THE EMERGENCY DEMOLITION ORDINANCE, IT DOESN'T PERTAIN JUST
TO PEOPLE LIVING IN
19:57:04  A BUILDING.
AS I MENTIONED,
19:57:07  IT CAN AFFECT PLANTS, OTHER STRUCTURE
19:57:10 S,
ADJACENT PROPERTY.
SO IT'S NOT
19:57:13  JUST DEPENDENT ON WHETHER A PERSON WOULD BE
LIVING IN THE
19:57:17  BUILDING OR NOT.
I HOPE THAT HELPS.

19:57:21 >> Councilmember Jones: OKAY.
I WAS JUST CURIOUS IF THE PROPERTY ITSELF IS SECURED OR
19:57:24  IF
THERE'S THE ABILITY FOR SOMEONE TO MAKE AN
19:57:27  UNAUTHORIZED
ENTRY INTO IT AND SET UP CAMP, DOES THAT
19:57:30  PUT THEM IN DANGER
IN ITS CURRENT EDITION
19:57:33 ?

19:57:36 >> WELL, SO THE PLANNING MANAGER
19:57:39  WORKED WITH THE BUILDING --
CITY'S CHIEF BUILDING
19:57:42  OFFICIAL, WHO WENT OUT TO THE SITE IN
APRIL AND DETERMINED THAT THERE WASN'T
19:57:46  A RISK OF THAT
BUILDING COLLAPSING.

19:57:49 SO I DON'T KNOW -- MORE BEYOND THAT, I CAN'T SPEAK
19:57:52  TO.
>> Councilmember Jones: OKAY.
SO IN ESSENCE, OUR DECISION AS TO 
19:57:55 WHETHER OR NOT THIS SITE
OVERALL IS HISTORICAL OR
19:57:59  NOT IS GOING TO DETERMINE WHAT THE
PROPERTY
19:58:02  OWNER'S OPTIONS ARE AS FAR AS
19:58:05  BEING ABLE TO SELL OR
OTHERWISE DISPOSE
19:58:08  OF THE PROPERTY.
IS THAT CORRECT?
>> THAT'S CORRECT
19:58:11 .
THEY WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD WITH DEMOLITION OF

19:58:16 THAT BARN STRUCTURE UNLESS THERE'S A DECISION MADE TONIGHT
THAT IT'S
19:58:19  NOT A POTENTIAL REGISTER RESOURCE, OR THAT
19:58:22  THE
EMERGENCY DEMOLITION FINDINGS CAN BE MET
19:58:26  OF A STEJ REMEMBER
19:58:30 
A REGISTER RESOURCE
19:58:32 .
THERE'S TWO DECISIONS TONIGHT.


19:58:35 >> Councilmember Jones: JUST TO CLARIFY, THE HISTORICAL
SIGNIFICANCE IS NOT STRICTLY
19:58:38  BASED ON AGE, CORRECT?
>> NO
19:58:41 , IN THIS CASE, IT WAS ARCHITECTURE
19:58:46  THAT WAS PUT INTO
THE
19:58:49  PAGE AND TURNBULL D
19:58:52 PR, AND JUST THE FARMSTEAD SETTING
AND HOW
19:58:56  THAT WAS A CHARACTERISTIC OF
19:58:59  FREMONT BACK AT THAT
PERIOD.

19:59:03 >> Councilmember Jones: AND HOW DOES THIS PLAY OVERALL INTO
THE FACT THAT THIS PROPERTY IS LOCATED 
19:59:06 WITHIN THE TOD FOR
IRVINGTON BART?

19:59:09 >> THERE'S NO PROVISIONS IN THE TOD THAT WOULD
19:59:13  AFFECT --
THAT WOULD SORT OF TRUMP
19:59:16 , SO TO SPEAK, THE HISTORIC
RESOURCES ORDINANCE.
WE STILL
19:59:19  GET TO DO THAT REVIEW EVEN IF WE HAVE A TO DSM
19:59:26  TOD PROJECT, I GUESS.
>> Councilmember Jones: OKAY, THANK YOU.

19:59:28 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
CLARIFYING QUESTIONS, COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN.

19:59:32 >> Councilmember Kassan: THANK YOU.
SO I'M DEFINITELY A
19:59:35  BIG FAN OF CO HOUSING,
19:59:38  BUT MY UNDERSTANDING
 IS THAT WHAT WE'RE BEING ASKED
19:59:42  TO DETERMINE ISN'T REALLY
TIED TO THE
19:59:45  CO HOUSING
19:59:49  USE BECAUSE THERE'S NO GUARANTEE
THAT THE
19:59:52  SITE WOULD BE USED FOR CO HOUSING,
19:59:55  RIGHT?
THIS PROPERTY OWN E IF WE DID SAY YOU COULD
19:59:58  DEMOLISH THE
BUILDING, THERE WOULD BE NOTHING TO STOP THE PROPERTY OWNER

20:00:01 FROM SELLING TO ANOTHER DEVELOPER OTHER THAN THE CO
20:00:03  HOUSING
COMMUNITY.
IS THAT TRUE?

20:00:07 OR -- AND THIS MIGHT BE A QUESTION FOR THE
20:00:10  FIRST PERSON WHO
SPHOAK, IS THERE ALREADY
20:00:13  A CONTRACT IN PLACE THAT WOULD
OBLIGATE
20:00:16  THE OWNER TO SELL TO THE CO-HOUSING COMMUNITY
20:00:20 
CONTINGENT ON THE ABILITY TO DEMOLISH THIS BUILDING
20:00:23 .
>> Mayor Mei: MY APOLOGIES,
20:00:26  THAT WOULD BE DIRECTED TO STAFF.
I JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY.

20:00:31 >> Councilmember Kassan: I DON'T KNOW IF STAFF KNOWS
WHAT
20:00:34  THE AGREEMENT IS.
>> STAFF IS NOT AWARE OF ANY AGREEMENT.

20:00:36 THE APPLICANT SHOULD ANSWER THAT QUESTION.
>> MAY I ANSWER?

20:00:40 >> Mayor Mei: YES, PLEASE.
>> YES, THERE IS A CONTRACT IN PLACE.

20:00:43 >> Councilmember Kassan: OKAY.
SO IT WOULDN'T BE POSSIBLE FOR THE OWNER TO SELL
20:00:46  TO A
DIFFERENT DEVELOPER?

20:00:48 OKAY.
>> NO, IT WOULD NOT.
>> Councilmember Kassan: THANK YOU.

20:00:53 >> Mayor Mei: ANY OTHER  CLARIFYING QUESTIONS?
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN?

20:00:59 OKAY.
NEXT, CLARIFYING QUESTIONS, COUNCILMEMBER COX
20:01:02 .

20:01:06 KOCH COX THANK YOU.
I WANTED TO FIND OUT, I DIDN'T SEE IN READING
20:01:09  THE REPORTS IF
THERE WAS ANY
20:01:15  WATER TEST OR ANY TYPE OF UNDERGROUND STORAGE
TANK OR SOMETHING ASSOCIAT
20:01:18 ED WITH THAT PIECE
20:01:21  OF PROPERTY.
DID ANYBODY CHECK THAT PART OUT?

20:01:27 >> THAT WAS NOT PART OF THE SUBMITTAL
20:01:31  FOR THE PROPOSED
REVIEW AND DEMOLITION.

20:01:36 THAT MIGHT BE SOMETHING IF WE HAD A DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
THERE
20:01:39  THAT STAFF WOULD WANT TO SEE.
BUT
20:01:42  THAT ISN'T PART OF WHAT WAS SUBMITTED IN TERMS OF THE
HISTORIC
20:01:45  REVIEW.
>> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.
NOT A PROBLEM.

20:01:50 I LIKE THE IDEA OF CO HOUSING BECAUSE
20:01:53  I THINK THAT THE COST
OF LIVING
20:01:57  AS WE KNOW IS VERY HIGH IN OUR AREA, AND I
20:02:00  THINK
BEING THAT
20:02:04  THIS COHOUSING IS A PART OF OUR
20:02:07  MASTER PLAN,
THAT THERE SHOULD BE SOME CONSIDERATION
20:02:10  GIVEN IN TERMS OF
20:02:14 
ALLOWING PEOPLE TO HAVE AFFORDABLE HOUSING, AN HAVING A

20:02:18 UNIQUE  SETUP, BECAUSE IT KIND OF REMINDS ME OF MY
20:02:21 
COLLEGE DAYS, THAT I LIVED IN A COHOUSING
20:02:24  UNIT AND I WAS
WITH STUDENTS
20:02:27  FROM AROUND THE WORLD, AND WE SHARED BATHROOMS,
20:02:31 
 KITCHENS, LIVING  ROOMS TOGETHER,
20:02:34  AND WE GREW, WE
EDUCATED EACH OTHER
20:02:37 , UNDERSTANDING MORE OF WHAT THINGS WERE
HAPPENING IN
20:02:40  EACH ONE OF OUR PARTS OF THE WORLD
20:02:44 , BUT ALSO WE
CAME TOGETHER BECAUSE WE WERE THERE FOR THE REASON, WAS TO

20:02:47 GET A GOOD EDUCATION, AND I THINK IT'S JUST KIND OF THE
UNIQUE SETUP
20:02:51  THAT BEING ABLE TO SHARE COMMON AREA
20:02:54 S AND
THINGS IS ALLOWING A COMMUNITY
20:02:57  TO INTERACT.
I
20:03:00  AM REPRESENTING DISTRICT 6, IRVINGTON, AND CERTAINLY
20:03:04  HAVE
BEEN
20:03:08  DOWN TO THAT PROPERTY, AND THERE IS A LOT OF OTHER
20:03:11 
MULTI-UNITS AROUND THERE, SO IT
20:03:14  WOULDN'T BE
SOMETHING THAT WAS OUT OF PLACE FOR IT,
20:03:17  BUT I THINK WE
SHOULD GIVE IT A CHANCE, WHERE PEOPLE CAN LIVE IN PIECE
20:03:20  AND
HARMONY AND ALSO BLEND IN WITH THE REST OF THE COMMUNITY,

20:03:24 WHICH IS VERY SIMILAR, AND I AM IN FULL SUPPORT
20:03:27  OF
MULTIGENERATIONAL LIVING, AND
20:03:31  FOR US TO BE ABLE TO WORK
TOGETHER
20:03:34 .
AT THIS POINT I WOULDN'T DEEM IT AS SOMETHING
20:03:36  HISTORICAL
BECAUSE IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE'S BEEN TOO MANY CHANGES.

20:03:40 I'M AN ENGINEER BY TRAINING, AND
20:03:43  ED EDUCATION AND
EXPERIENCES,
20:03:46  AND ONCE YOU CHANGE IT TOO MANY TIMES, IT KIND
20:03:49 
OF ALLOWS ITSELF TO EVOLVE INTO
20:03:52  A NEW TYPE OF HOUSING.
TO I
20:03:56  WOULD LOOK AT IN TERMS OF
20:04:00  SEEING HOW WE COULD MOVE
FORWARD AND ALLOW
20:04:03 ING THE STRUCTURE TO BE CHANGE
20:04:06 ED AND BEING
ABLE TO
20:04:11  TAKE TO THE NEXT LEVEL THAT IT WOULD TURN INTO A CO
20:04:14 
HOUSING UNIT.
GLRCHLT SO MY APOLOGIES, IN ADDITIONAL
20:04:17  CLARIFYING QUESTIONS?

20:04:23 >> Councilmember Cox: YEAH, THERE IS A 'NOTHER ONE I WOULD
LIKE TO FIND
20:04:27  OUT IS, IN TERMS OF FOR THE CLARIFICATION,
20:04:30  I
GUESS IT'S LIKE YOU
20:04:35  HAD TWO DIFFERENT FINDINGS BUT WHICH ONE
TAKES PRECEDENCE OVER
20:04:38  THE OTHER?
THAT'S THE PART THAT IS NOT CLEAR IN THIS TYPE OF RULING OR
20:04:41 
SETUP, BECAUSE OF
20:04:44  -- YOU HAVE THE HARB AND THEN YOU HAVE
CITY AND,
20:04:47  YOU KNOW, AND THEN YOU HAVE A HISTORICAL
20:04:51  EXPERT,
SO THOSE THINGS ARE KIND OF
20:04:54  ALL MIX MATCH IN THAT REGARD.
SO WHAT WOULD BE THE
20:04:57  RULE OF THUMB IN THIS TYPE OF OPERATION
OF
20:05:00  PROCEEDING FORWARD?

20:05:05 >> Mayor Mei: SO I THINK THAT'S A LITTLE OF WHAT WE'RE GOING
TO BE DISCUSSING AS
20:05:08  EACH HAS SHARED A LITTLE BIT OF THEIR
PERSPECTIVES.
>> Councilmember Cox: BUT
20:05:11  WHAT'S THE RULING?  WHAT'S THE
LAW THAT WOULD DICTATE TO
20:05:14  IT?
>> Mayor Mei: I DON'T BELIEVE,
20:05:17  PLANNER ROTH OR ATTORNEY,
THAT THIS IS WHAT WE'RE
20:05:21  DECIDING.
THERE IS NO SPECIFIC LAW THAT I'M AWARE OF
20:05:24  AS TWO PARTIES
HAVE BOTH BEEN CERTIFIED AT PROVIDE
20:05:27 ING THE INFORMATION, I
THINK IT WILL BE UP TO THE DISCRETION OF THE
20:05:30  COUNCIL AND I
WOULD TURN TO PLANNER
20:05:33  ROTH AS WELL AS
20:05:37  COUNSEL MARGOLIS TO BE
ABLE TO
20:05:40  ANSWER THAT.
>> YES, THAT'S CORRECT, AND COUNCIL CAN CONSIDER ALL OF THE

20:05:43 EVIDENCE, BOTH OF THE DPRs AND THE APPLICANT
20:05:47 'S
PRESENTATION PUBLIC INPUT TONIGHT.

20:05:50 THAT'S DIFFERENT THAN WHEN THE PLANNING MANAGER RECEIVED
THAT
20:05:54  PER THE HISTORIC RESOURCES ORDINANCE, IT'S
20:05:57  SIMPLY A
HISTORICALLY
20:06:00  QUALIFIED PROFESSIONAL PROVIDING THAT HISTORIC
20:06:03 
EVALUATION, THAT THE PLANNING MANAGER AT THAT POINT IN TIME

20:06:07 HAS BEFORE HIM OR HER, AND REVIEWS
20:06:10  THAT, AND THEN IT
ELEVATES TO WHAT'S CONSIDERED
20:06:13  A POTENTIAL REGISTER RESOURCE.
SO AT THAT
20:06:16  POINT, BASICALLY THE PLANNING MANAGER MADE THE
DECISION THAT HE HAD
20:06:20  TO BASED ON THE COAT, AND THEN IT GOES
TO HARB
20:06:23  ON APPEAL, BUT PER THE
20:06:27  SECTION I SITED IN THE
PRESENTATION, HARB AND
20:06:30  COUNCIL HAVE THE ABILITY TO CONSIDER
THAT SECOND BPR,
20:06:33  AND ALL OF THE OTHER INFORMATION PRESENTED.

20:06:41 >> Ms. Shackelford: BILL, CAN I ASK YOU TO PUT UP THE
20:06:44  FINAL
SLIDE AGAIN?
>> Mayor Mei: THE QUESTIONS,
20:06:48  THAT ACTUALLY PERTAINS AND I
THINK ONE OF OUR COUNCILMEMBERS REFERENCED IT TOO.

20:06:51 I THINK CERTAINLY MANY OF US ARE SUPPORTIVE OF THE CONCEPT
OF CO
20:06:54  HOUSING BECAUSE OF OUR DISCUSSIONS IN
20:06:57  OUR GENERAL PLAN,
 BUT I THINK THE SUMMARY OF THE KEY CONSIDERATIONS,
20:07:00  WHICH IS
THE LAST SLIDE, IS THE QUESTION THAT WE'RE CALLING
20:07:03  TO.
SO DO WE HAVE ANY OTHER  CLARIFYING QUESTION
20:07:06 S?
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN?

20:07:12 >> Councilmember Salwan: YES, MADAME MAYOR.
I THINK THERE'S TWO ASPECTS OF OUR 
20:07:16 ROLE.
ONE IS THE LEGISLATIVE AND POLICY-MAKING, AND THE OTHER
20:07:19  IS
THE QUASI JUDICIAL WHERE WE GET TO DECIDE
20:07:22 , AND THIS IS ONE
OF THOSE, I THINK, HEARINGS THAT WE HAVE THAT
20:07:25  CITY COUNCIL
DECIDES WHAT HAPPEN
20:07:31 S, SO IT'S KIND OF LIKE A JUDGE.
BUT MY QUESTION IS, I JUST  WANTED TO
20:07:34  HAVE MS.
20:07:38  -- RECAP
WHY SHE FEELS THAT THIS PROJECT IS NOT HISTORIC
20:07:41 , JUST KIND
OF HIGH LEVEL WITHOUT GETTING INTO THE WEEDS, IF YOU
20:07:45  COULD
JUST SUMMARIZE WHY YOU BELIEVE THIS PROJECT OR
20:07:48  THIS BARN IS
NOT HISTORIC?
>> WELL, FIRST OF ALL
20:07:51 , I THINK IT'S NOT THAT WE'RE
CONSIDERING ONE BUILDING BUT
20:07:54  WE'RE CONSIDERING THE WHOLE
SITE.  AND WHEN WE CONSIDER THE
20:07:57  WHOLE SITE AND ITS ABILITY
TO COMMUNICATE
20:08:01  AN ONGOING OR PREVIOUS AK TEURL OPERATION
20:08:04 
FROM A FAMILY FARM, WE DON'T SEE IT THERE.

20:08:08 WE SEE BUILDINGS THAT ARE
20:08:11  OF DIFFERENT TIME PERIODS, WE SEE
ALTERATIONS
20:08:14  THAT HAVE REALLY TAKEN AWAY FROM THEIR
ARCHITECTURE
20:08:17  TO THE POINT THAT SOMEONE COMING ON TO THE
20:08:20 
PROPERTY WITHOUT PRIOR KNOWLEDGE WOULD
20:08:23  NOT UNDERSTAND, WOULD
NOT BE ABLE TO TELL WHAT WAS THERE.

20:08:27 IT'S LOST THE CONTEXT AND THE SETTING
20:08:30  OF WHAT MAY HAVE
BEEN THERE, BUT AS I MENTIONED,
20:08:33  WE COULD FIND NO EVIDENCE
THAT THERE WAS
20:08:36  A PREVIOUS HOUSE ON THE PROPERTY.
AND SO THAT
20:08:39  MAKES IT QUITE DIFFICULT TO CONSIDER IT A FARM
20:08:42 
FARMSTEAD IF THERE WAS NO HOUSE
20:08:45  HOUSE -- AT THE TIME OF THE
BARN
20:08:48  AND THE TANKHOUSE.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

20:08:52 DOES THAT ANSWER YOUR CLARIFYING QUESTIONS?

20:08:55 COUNCILMEMBER KENG, COLLAR  GUYING QUESTIONS?
>> Councilmember Keng: YES
20:08:58 , THANK YOU, MAYOR.
SO I DO HAVE A QUESTION, SO
20:09:01  ONE OF THE TWO CRITERIAS THAT
WE'RE TRYING
20:09:05  TO DETERMINE, WHETHER THERE IS
20:09:08  IMMEDIATE
DANGER FROM THE BUILDING.
SINCE NOBODY
20:09:11  CAN REALLY SAY, I THINK, NOW
20:09:14 , BUT CAN WE
PERHAPS CONSIDER FROM THE OTHER
20:09:17  PERSPECTIVE, WOULD THE STAFF
20:09:20 
CONSIDER THE --
20:09:25  -- BUILDING?
>> I'M SORRY, IT JUST CUT OUT THERE, THE
20:09:28  VERY LAST
FIVE SECONDS.

20:09:32 >> Councilmember Keng: FROM OUR EXPERTISE OF OUR STAFF,
WOULD YOU
20:09:35  CONSIDER THE BUILDING A SAFE BUILDING?

20:09:44 >> SO IT NOT FOR THIS STAFF MEMBER TO MAKE THAT
20:09:47  DECISION.
AS I SAID, THE PLANNING MANAGER CONSULTED
20:09:50  WITH THE CHIEF
BUILDING OFFICIAL WHO WENT OUT IN APRIL.

20:09:54 AND HE DETERMINED AT THAT TIME THAT IT
20:09:57  WASN'T AN IMMEDIATE
OR
20:10:00  POTENTIAL HAZARD THAT WOULD
20:10:04  BE SUBJECT TO
EMERGENCY DEMOLITION.

20:10:09 >> Councilmember Keng: OKAY.
THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

20:10:12 COUNCILMEMBER JONES, CLARIFYING QUESTIONS.
>> Councilmember Jones: 
20:10:15 MR. ROTH , COULD YOU PUT UP
THAT SLIDE AGAIN WITH THE
20:10:18  TWO CONCLUSIONS?
I BELIEVE IT WAS THE LAST SLIDE YOU PUT UP.

20:10:22 >> Mayor Mei: IT WAS THE LAST SLIDE, YES.

20:10:27 >> Ms. Gauthier: I CAN SCREEN SHARE THAT.
>> Mayor Mei: THAT WOULD
20:10:30  BE GREAT.

20:10:36 >> Councilmember Jones: SO JUST TO CLARIFY, IF WE
20:10:41  FOLLOW
OPTION NUMBER 1 AND WE DETERMINE THE PROPERTY IS NOT A
20:10:45 
POTENTIAL HISTORIC RESOURCE, THEN OPTION NUMBER
20:10:48  TWO
BASICALLY GOES AWAY, IS THAT CORRECT?
>> YES, THAT'S CORRECT.

20:10:52 >> Councilmember Jones: OKAY.
THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

20:10:56 VICE MAYOR SHAO, CLARIFYING QUESTIONS?
AND I WILL NOTE
20:10:59  THAT I'M LOOKING AT THE TIME, WE ARE DUE FOR
A BREAK AT
20:11:02  8:15.
>> Vice Mayor Shao: THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR.

20:11:05 ACTUALLY MY QUESTION IS FOR THE CITY ATTORNEY
20:11:08 , DEBRA
MARGOLIS.
I JUST FOUND
20:11:11  OUT FROM GOOGLE MAP THAT THAT SIDE IS
20:11:15  WITHIN
HALF A MILE FROM MY RESIDENCE
20:11:18 .
EVEN THOUGH I DO NOT HAVE ANY
20:11:21  DIRECT OR INDIRECT
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE POTENTIAL BUYER AND THE
20:11:25  CURRENT
OWNER.
IN THAT CASE, SHALL I RECUSE
20:11:28  MYSELF FROM THIS ISSUE?

20:11:36 >> Ms. Margolis: HALF A MILE IS MORE THAN 500 FEET, IS IT
NOT?

20:11:40 >> Mayor Mei: YES.
>> Ms. Margolis: IF YOU'RE MORE THAN 500 FEET,
20:11:43  THEN YOU'RE
OKAY TO PARTICIPATE.

20:11:47 
>> Vice Mayor Shao: 
20:11:50 IT IS DEFINITELY MORE THAN 500 FEET.
IN THAT CASE, I JUST
20:11:53  HAVE ONE QUESTION.
I KEPT
20:11:57  HEARING THAT
20:12:00  THE SITE SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS A WHOLE
AS TO
20:12:03  THE -- WHETHER IT'S HISTORIC OR NOT.

20:12:07 I JUST WANT TO ASK THE STAFF WHETHER TYPICALLY
20:12:10  WHEN WE LOOK
AT A BUILDING,
20:12:14  WILL WE JUST LOOK AT THE BUILDING BY ITSELF
OR
20:12:17  DO WE LOOK AT THE WHOLE SITE, FOR EXAMPLE
20:12:21 , REMEMBER WE
HAVE THAT BOWL PLACE,
20:12:28  BOWLING PLACE, THERE WAS
THE ISSUE WHETHER IT SHOULD BE REGISTERED
20:12:31  AS A HISTORIC
BUILDING.
AT THAT TIME, THE STANDARD FOR THAT
20:12:34 TISH
20:12:38 
THAT ISSUE, IS THAT STILL APPLICABLE FOR
20:12:41  THIS SITE?
THAT'S MY QUESTION.
>> 
20:12:44 IF WE GET A FULL FORMAL DEVELOPMENT PROPOSAL, IF WE
20:12:47  HAD
THAT, YOU KNOW, WE WOULD WANT TO LOOK
20:12:50 , AND IF THEY ARE
PROPOSING AT THAT TIME JUST TO REMOVE
20:12:54  THE BARN AS OPPOSED
TO OTHER STRUCTURES, WE
20:12:57  MOVE ON TO GET A REPORT FOR THAT.
BUT AT THIS POINT, WHAT WE HAVE
20:13:00  IS A REPORT FOR THE ENTIRE
20:13:04 
PROPERTY, YOU KNOW, OF WHICH CONTAINS
20:13:07  THREE PRIMARY
STRUCTURES, THE HOUSE, THE TANKHOUSE AND THE BARN.

20:13:11 AND THAT'S BASICALLY THE INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE.
AND
20:13:14  THEN WE HAVE THE SECOND DPR THAT FINDS
20:13:17  THAT THE PROPERTY
IS NOT A POTENTIAL REGISTER
20:13:20  RESOURCE.

20:13:27 SO THAT'S SORT OF THE SITUATION WE'RE IN WHEN
20:13:30  WE DON'T HAVE
THE FULL TYPE OF REVIEW THAT WE WOULD DO BECAUSE EMERGENCY

20:13:33 DEMOLITIONS HAVE BEEN PROPOSED.
SO IT'S NOT PACKAGED
20:13:36  WITH A DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
WHERE WE DO THAT FULL REVIEW.

20:13:41 >> Vice Mayor Shao: THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
AT THIS TIME, THERE
20:13:44  ARE -- I DON'T SEE ANY ADDITIONAL
 CLARIFYING QUESTIONS, BUT BECAUSE I
20:13:47  KNOW -- I SAW
EARLIER THERE ARE QUITE A FEW SPEAKERS, AN WE'RE DUE FOR
20:13:51  A
BREAK AT 8:15, I'D LIKE TO CALL
20:13:54  A QUICK BREAK.
SO WE'LL
20:13:57  TAKE A 10 MINUTE BREAK AND RETURN AT
20:14:00  8:23.
SO AT THIS TIME, I'D
20:14:03  LIKE TO PUT A -- IF YOU
20:14:07  WERE GOING TO
GO ON A BREAK, PLEASE BE SURE TO SILENCE
20:14:10  YOUR -- MUTE YOUR
MIC AND ALSO YOUR VIDEO.

20:14:13 THANK YOU.
SEE YOU BACK IN TEP
20:14:16  10 MINUTES.

20:15:50 



20:15:51 



20:22:50 >> Mayor Mei:   I'D LIKE TO CALL 
PEOPLE BACK.
WELCOME BACK
20:22:53 .

20:23:23 WELCOME BACK TO THE COUNCIL 
MEETING.
I'D LIKE TO
20:23:26  CALL PEOPLE BACK TO 
ORDER.

20:23:39 AND I SEE, I THINK WE'RE MISSING 
A
20:23:42  COUPLE COUNCILMEMBERS.

20:23:49 COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN,
20:23:53  
COUNCILMEMBER SHAO.
20:23:57 
AND WE'RE MISSING COUNCILMEMBER 
KENG
20:24:02  AND COUNCILMEMBER COX.
>> Councilmember Cox:   NO, I'M 
HERE
20:24:05 .
>> Mayor Mei:   OKAY, SORRY, 
GREAT.

20:24:08 COUNCILMEMBER KENG.
OH, THERE SHE IS.
20:24:11 
SO I SEE.
IF EVERYONE'S BACK, I'M GOING TO
20:24:15  
CALL THE MEETING BACK TO ORDER 
AND WE'LL START WITH OUR
20:24:18  PUBLIC 
SPEAKERS ON THIS, SO I THINK I'M 
GOING
20:24:21  TO OPEN THE PUBLIC HEARING 
AT THIS TIME.

20:24:28 SO I'M GOING TO CALL THE FIRST 
SPEAKER.
>> MADAM
20:24:31  MAYOR, WE HAVE MARY NO 
LAST NAME LISTED
20:24:34  FROM EARLIER.
>> Mayor Mei:   YES SO WE'LL
20:24:37  
BEGIN WITH MARY.
I THINK SHE WAS ASKED TO SPEAK 

20:24:41 ON THIS AGENDA ITEM.
WELCOME MARY.
>> I APOLOGIZE, I
20:24:45  HAD ACTUALLY 
ACCIDENTALLY
20:24:48  --
>> Mayor Mei:   MARY, YOU'RE ON 
MUTE AGAIN.

20:24:54 >> SORRY, NOR SOME REASON IT 
WENT ON MUTE.

20:24:57 I ACTUALLY PUSHED RAISE HAND 
EARLIER
20:25:01 , I MADE A MISTAKE.
I'LL MAKE A COMMENT, YOUR TIME
20:25:04  
IS VALUABLE.
TO SAY OF THE HISTORIC
20:25:08  SITES OF 
FREMONT THE ONES THAT MEAN THE 
MOST TO ME ARE
20:25:11  THE OPERATING 
ONES SUCH AS ARDENWOOD AND WITH 
THIS SITE HAVING
20:25:14  HAD AS MANY 
REVISIONS AS IT HAS HAD 
RENOVATION
20:25:18 S IT DOES SEEM TO HAVE 
LOST SOME OF ITS
20:25:20  HISTORICAL 
VALUE SO I JUST WANT TO SAY 
THAT.

20:25:25 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.
THE NEXT SPEAKER
20:25:29  IS DOUG FORD.
WELCOME.

20:25:42 >> OH.
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.
YOU'RE NO LONGER ON MUTE SO I
20:25:45  
CAN HEAR YOU DOUG.
>> YES ANY NAME IS DOUG
20:25:49  FORD, 
LONG TIME RESIDENT OF FREMONT
20:25:52  
AND IN SUPPORT OF THE PEOPLE 
THAT'S BEEN PRESENTED
20:25:55  BY 
MR. MEZETTI.
A COUPLE OF
20:25:58  THINGS WOULD I 
EMPHASIZE, YOU'VE HEARD SOME
20:26:01  OF 
THIS BUT TO MAKE SURE IT 
REGISTERS.

20:26:04 NUMBER 1, BUILDINGS ON THE SITE 
HAVE
20:26:08  BEEN ALTERED SUBSTANTIALLY 
AND THAT BRINGS IN THE
20:26:10  QUESTION 
WHETHER OR NOT IT'S ACTUALLY 
HISTORICAL.

20:26:13 NUMBER 2, TWO
20:26:17  LOTS AWAY FROM 
THIS SITE WAS A SIMILAR
20:26:20  SITE 
WITH SIMILAR STRUCTURES.
TWO HOUSES
20:26:23 , A BARN AND A PUMP 
HOUSE.
ONE OF THE
20:26:26  HOUSES, THE BARN AND 
THE
20:26:30  PUMP HOUSE WERE PERMITTED TO 
BE REMOVED FOR THE CONSTRUCTION
20:26:33  
OF TOWN HOUSES.
SO THERE'S A PRECEDENT FOR
20:26:36  
REMOVING THESE KINDS OF OLDER 
BUILDINGS
20:26:40 .
AND USING IT FOR BETTER 
PURPOSES.

20:26:43 THE THIRD POINT IS:  I THINK
20:26:47  THE -- ONE OF THE CONSIDERATIONS 
THAT COUNCIL HAS TO MAKE
20:26:50  IS, AS
20:26:53  
THE REPRESENTATIVE'S LEADERSHIP 
OF THE CITY AROUND
20:26:56  LAND USE, 
WHAT'S THE BEST USE OF THIS 
PROPERTY?
20:26:59 
TO MAINTAIN A DECREPIT
20:27:02  BARN, AND 
A SIGNIFICANTLY
20:27:05  ALTERED SING 
FAMILY HOME OR ALTERNATIVELY
20:27:08 , TO 
BE ABLE TO SITE 32 NEW
20:27:12  HOMES.
AND GIVEN THE HOUSING CRISIS
20:27:15  
THAT FREMONT AND CALIFORNIA IS 
IN, IT SEEMS TO
20:27:19  ME A VERY EASY 
DECISION TO SAY WE NEED MORE 
HOMES
20:27:22 , NOT FEWER.
THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei:  
20:27:25  THANK YOU.
AND THE NEXT SPEAKER IS
20:27:30  DICK 
PANTAGES.
WELCOME
20:27:33 , DICK.

20:27:37 >> OKAY.
ALL RIGHT.
WE'RE
20:27:41  DICK AND SANDY PANTAGES
20:27:44 .
WE'RE MEMBERS OF THE MISSION 
PEAK
20:27:47  COULD-HOUSING VILLAGE.
WE HAVE LIVED
20:27:50  HERE FOR OVER 21 
YEARS AND SANDY WORKED
20:27:53  IN 
FREMONT FOR OVER 32 YEARS BEFORE
20:27:57  
SHE RETIRED.
WE WOULD LIKE YOU TO FIND
20:28:00  THE 
PROPERTY IS NOT A HISTORIC 
RESOURCE, THE CONCLUSION OF THE
20:28:03  
REPORT.
WE HAVE BEEN WORKING FOR SEVEN 

20:28:07 YEARS TO FIND A CO-HOUSING SITE 
IN FREMONT AND THIS IS
20:28:10  ONLY SITE 
WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FIND.
20:28:13 
IF YOU DENY THIS APPEAL, IT WILL
20:28:17  
EFFECTIVELY END OUR SEARCH FOR A 
GREEN COMMUNITY.
20:28:20 
THANK YOU FOR YOUR 
CONSIDERATION.

20:28:22 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.
THAT WAS THE LAST OF THE PUBLIC 
SPEAKERS.

20:28:30 >> FOR THE HARB?
>> Mayor Mei:   I'M GOING TO 
CLOSE
20:28:33  THE PUBLIC COMMENT AND I'M 
GOING TO TURN IT BACK OVER
20:28:37 .
>> PEOPLE DIDN'T SHOW UP.

20:28:41 >> Mayor Mei:   MY APOLOGIES.
IS SOMEONE
20:28:44  ELSE ON -- IF YOU 
COULD
20:28:47  MUTE URSA IF YOU ARE NOT 
SPEAKING
20:28:51  BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE 
GREAT.
I HEARD ANOTHER SPEAKER JUST NOW
20:28:54 
NOW.
I'D LIKE TO TURN IT BACK TO THE 

20:28:57 COUNCIL FOR -- WAIT, THERE'S A 
COUPLE MORE SPEAKERS BUT I'M 
CLOSING THE
20:29:00  PUBLIC COMMENT.
THIS IS THE FINAL CALL.
I SEE SOME
20:29:03  HAND JUST CAME UP BUT 
I --
20:29:07  THAT WAS WHAT WE'D ASKED 
PEOPLE, THAT'S WHY WE
20:29:10  HAD THE 
PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD SO I'M A 
LITTLE CONFUSED AS
20:29:13  TO WHY HANDS 
ARE NOW SHOWING UP.

20:29:17 BECAUSE THAT'S WHY WE HAD OPENED 
UP THE PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD.

20:29:21 I WILL ALLOW FOR LAST THREE 
SPEAKERS BECAUSE I'M
20:29:24  A LITTLE 
CONFUSED AS TO -- WE OPENED THE 
PUBLIC COMMENT
20:29:27  AND THEN IF YOU 
RAISE YOUR HANDS WE CAN CALL ON 
YOU.

20:29:30 AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO CLOSE 
THE PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD AND
20:29:32  
TURN IT BACK TO THE COUNCIL FOR 
DISCUSSION.

20:29:35 SO THE THREE SPEAKERS ARE ANN 
MORRISON
20:29:38 , DANIEL O'DONNELL AND 
LAURA
20:29:43  AND MATTHEW.
I'M GOING TO CLOSE THE PUBLIC 
COMMENT
20:29:46  AND I'M NOT SURE WHAT 
HAPPENED THERE.
IF WE COULD KEEP
20:29:49  THAT TO TWO 
MINUTES EACH SO WE CAN GET IT 
BACK TO THE
20:29:52  COUNCIL FOR 
DISCUSSION.
>> I'M SORRY, MADAM MAYOR, HOW 

20:29:55 MANY MINUTES DID YOU SAY?
>> WE'VE BEEN DOING THREE 
MINUTES
20:29:58 .
>> Mayor Mei:   OKAY WE'LL JUST 
KEEP IT THREE THEN, IT'S NOT 

20:30:02 GOING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE, 
THREE MINUTES TOTAL.
>> I'LL
20:30:05  ALLOW --
>> Mayor Mei:   I'M GOING TO 
CLOSE THE PUBLIC COMMENT
20:30:08  PERIOD 
AFTER THIS.
I WAS A LIMB CONFUSED, I CLOSE
20:30:11 ED 
IT ALREADY AND ALL OF A SUDDEN,
20:30:14  
HANDS WENT BACK UP.
>> MADAM MAYOR.

20:30:17 YOU WANT TO OPEN THE PUBLIC 
COMMENT FOR THESE THREE
20:30:19  
SPEAKERS.
>> Mayor Mei:   I'M GOING TO 

20:30:22 OPEN IT FOR THESE THREE, AND 
THEN CLOSE IT.
IT
20:30:25  SEEMED IT WAS MISSED.
>> WE'LL ALLOW ANN MORRISON
20:30:28  TO 
SPEAK FIRST.
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

20:30:31 >> HI, THANK YOU MAYOR MEI.

20:30:34 I THINK I'M SPEAKING FOR A FEW 
OTHER
20:30:37  PUBLIC MEMBERS WHO ARE 
SIMPLY CONFUSED BY RAISING HANDS
20:30:38 
HANDS.
ANYWAY THANK YOU.

20:30:41 I'VE LIVED AROUND THE CORNER 
FROM THIS PROPERTY FOR OVER
20:30:45  20 
YEARS AND I'VE GROWN PRETTY 
INTERESTED IN DEVELOPMENT
20:30:48  AROUND 
OUR AREA LOCALLY WHAT GOES UP 
AND WHAT COMES DOWN
20:30:51  SO I'VE SEEN 
THE BARN FROM THE BACK SIDE AND 
I CAN TELL YOU
20:30:54  AS A LOCAL, IT'S 
REALLY NOT THAT INTERESTING.
20:30:57 
I UNDERSTAND THAT THE THREE 
BUILDINGS HAVE TO BE TAKEN AS
20:31:00  
KIND OF A PACKAGE DEAL.
AND
20:31:03  I WOULD URGE COUNCIL
20:31:07  TO NOT 
CONSIDER THESE BUILDINGS ON THE 
SITE AS
20:31:10  A POTENTIAL HISTORIC 
RESOURCE.
I THINK IF YOU DO,
20:31:13  WE LOSE MY 
AREA, LOSES AN
20:31:16  OPPORTUNITY TO 
GET SOME REALLY INTERESTING 
RESIDENTIAL REDEVELOPMENT
20:31:19 .
I THINK CO-HOUSING GROUP HAS A 
PLAN THAT HAS
20:31:23  A GREAT ADDITION.
THANK YOU.
20:31:26 
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.
NEXT SPEAKER,
20:31:29  SORRY, WOULD BE 
DANIEL
20:31:33  O'DONNELL.
WELCOME.

20:31:38 >> HELLO.

20:31:41 HI, MY NAME IS DANIEL O'
20:31:44 DONNELL 
AND I'M A LONG TERM RESIDENT OF 
FREMONT.
20:31:47 .
I
20:31:51  GREW UP IN NORTHERN FREMONT 
AND MOVED TO
20:31:54  IRVINGTON ABOUT 21 
YEARS AGO.
I'M VERY
20:31:57  FAMILIAR WITH THE CITY 
AND ALL THE CHANGES.
AS WELL AS I HAVE A
20:32:00  DEGREE, A 
HISTORY DEGREE FROM SAN JOSE
20:32:03  
STATE.
SO I CAN APPRECIATE
20:32:07  HISTORICAL 
PRESERVATION.
MY
20:32:10  MOTHER WORKED WITH MS. MIMI,
20:32:12  
WHO WAS THE PREVIOUS PROPERTY 
OWNER.

20:32:15 I THINK SHE'S THE MOTHER OF THE 
CURRENT OWNER.
AND
20:32:19  SHE BECAME GOOD FRIENDS WITH 
MS. MIMI
20:32:22 , SO I KNOW THE PROPERTY 
WELL, AS WELL.

20:32:27 I'VE BEEN FAMILIAR WITH HER AND 
THE PROPERTY FOR OVER 30
20:32:31  YEARS.
I THINK AS A POTENTIAL HISTORIC 
RESOURCE, THE
20:32:34  BARN WOULD FAR BE 
BETTER SERVING THE
20:32:37  COMMUNITY IF 
IT WAS REPURPOSED IN
20:32:40  A STYLE 
THAT JUST DOWN THE STREET,
20:32:44  THE 
HIGH STREET
20:32:48  SQUARE COMPLEX DID.
THAT REALLY GOT
20:32:51  THE ESSENCE OF 
WHAT
20:32:55  HISTORIC FARMING -- WHAT 
OUR HISTORIC FARMING AND
20:32:58  OUR 
COMMUNITY MIGHT HAVE BEEN
20:33:01  LIKE.
I DON'T THINK THE BARN WHICH 
ISN'T REALLY VISIBLE
20:33:05  FROM THE 
STREET ANYWAYS WITH ALL THE 
CHANGES I AGREE WITH EVERYBODY 

20:33:08 ELSE, WITH ALL THE DHAINGS IT 
JUST DOESN'T HAVE THAT
20:33:11  
HISTORICAL ESSENCE.
AND LIKE I SAID, THE COMMUNITY 

20:33:14 WOULD BE SERVED MUCH BETTER, IF 
THE BARN
20:33:18  WAS USED, REPURPOSED TO 
BE USED
20:33:21  IN ENHANCING THE PROJECT
20:33:24  
THAT THE CO-HOUSING PROJECT.
WITH THAT, THANK YOU.

20:33:30 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU 
DANIEL.
AND THE LAST AND FINAL
20:33:33  SPEAKER 
IS LAURA
20:33:38  AND MATTHEW.
>> THANK YOU SO
20:33:41  MUCH!
WE APPRECIATE HAVING
20:33:44  AN 
OPPORTUNITY TO TALK HERE RIGHT 
NOW
20:33:48 .
MATTHEW AND I ARE EDUCATE
20:33:51 ORS, 
LONG TEEM EDUCATORRORS
20:33:58  TIME EDUCATORS.
WE ARE VERY EXCITED ABOUT MOVING 
TO
20:34:01  FREMONT AND CONTRIBUTING TO 
THIS
20:34:05  ENERGETIC
20:34:08  ENERGETIC CITY AND DIVERSE 
CITY.
UNFORTUNATELY WE ARE NOT ABLE TO
20:34:11  
DID THAT UNLESS WE ARE PART OF 
CO-HOUSING.

20:34:14 AND CO-HOUSING WOULD ALLOW US TO 
MOVE INTO FREMONT
20:34:18  FOR AFFORDABLE 
HOUSING.
20:34:21 
SO WE URGE YOU TO PLEASE
20:34:25  SUPPORT 
MASETT
20:34:28 I'S APPEAL REGARDING THE
20:34:31  
40871 HIGH STREET AND WE HAVE
20:34:35  
REVIEWED ALL THE EVIDENCE 
REGARDING THIS BUILDING.

20:34:38 AND WE CONCLUDED THAT IT'S NOT 
LONG
20:34:42 ER A HISTORIC SITE.
SO
20:34:46  THANK YOU FOR YOUR DILIGENCE
20:34:49  
IN REVISING ALL THE DOCUMENTS 
THAT HAVE BEEN SENT TO THE CITY 

20:34:53 COUNCIL.
AND WE ARE HERE
20:34:56  REALLY, LOOKING 
FORWARD TO YOUR
20:34:59  SUPPORT, AGAIN, 
OF
20:35:03  BENJAMIN MASETTI
20:35:06 'S APPEAL 
REGARDING THE
20:35:10  40178 HIGH STREET.
THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei:  
20:35:13  THANK YOU.
TILT I'M GOING TO TURN IT BACK 
OVER TO THE
20:35:16  COUNCIL FOR 
DISCUSSION.
MS. GAUTHIER
20:35:20 , MAY I ASK IF YOU 
CAN PLEASE BRING
20:35:23  UP THE LAST 
SLIDE.
>> I CAN, MADAM MAYOR
20:35:26 .
>> Mayor Mei:   I'LL CLOSE THE 
PUBLIC COMMENT --

20:35:29 >> CAN YOU CLOSE THE PUBLIC 
COMMENT PERIOD.
THE
20:35:32  APPELLANT HAS FIVE MINUTES 
FOR REBUTTAL.
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU FOR
20:35:35  
THAT CLARIFICATION.
>> The Clerk:   I'LL TIME
20:35:38  IT ON 
MY END.
>> Mayor Mei:   I KNOW
20:35:41  WE HAD 
THREE SPEAKERS FOR THE 
APPELLANT.
20:35:44 
WHOMEVER YOU WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK 
OR YOU CAN SHARE
20:35:47  IT BUT IT'S 
TOTAL FIVE MINUTES.
>> WELL, WE
20:35:51  COULD DIVIDE IT 
BETWEEN BONNIE AND ME BUT I 
DON'T KNOW
20:35:54  WHAT TO REBUT.
IT FEELS TO ME AS IF -- THE
20:35:57  ONE 
THING THAT I THINK IT'S REALLY 
IMPORTANT TO
20:36:01  UNDERSTAND.
AND THE CITY ATTORNEY COULD DO
20:36:05  
THIS BETTER THAN I SO
20:36:08  COULD, IS 
THIS IS
20:36:12  AN APPEAL OF A
20:36:15  SPECIFIC 
DETERMINATION BY THE PLANNING 
MANAGER, AND THE
20:36:18  HISTORIC 
DETERMINATION WAS THAT THE 
PROPERTY AS A WHOLE WAS A 

20:36:22 POTENTIAL HISTORIC RESOURCE.
I JUST WANT TO BE SURE THAT WE 
UNDERSTAND
20:36:25  WE'RE NOT JUST 
TALKING ABOUT THE BARN ANYMORE.

20:36:30 >> Mayor Mei:   OKAY.
AND IS THERE ANY
20:36:33  OTHER COMMENT?
I DON'T KNOW, MS. GAUTHIER
20:36:37 , YOUR 
TIMING, IS THE OTHER PARTY, 
BONNIE, DID YOU
20:36:40  WANT TO ADD 
ANYTHING ELSE BECAUSE TOTAL IT'S 
FIVE
20:36:43  MINUTES COMBINED.
I'M SORRY, BONNIE
20:36:46  YOU ARE ON 
MUTE.

20:37:03 YOU'RE STILL ON MUTE, I'M SORRY.
THERE.
20:37:06 
>> THERE WE GO, ALL RIGHT, THANK 
YOU.

20:37:09 NO, I THINK MY CLOSING COMMENTS
20:37:13  
ARE ACTUALLY HAVE BEEN ECHOED BY 
PEOPLE WHO I THINK
20:37:16  ARE VERY 
FAMILIAR WITH THE PROPERTY.
THAT
20:37:19  THE ALTERATION, THE 
CHANGES,
20:37:23  THE DISCONTINUOUS USE
20:37:26  
WITH A HOUSE THAT IS MUCH NEWER 
THAN THE BARN
20:37:30 , OR THE TANK 
HOUSE, REALLY DOES NOT CREATE
20:37:33  
THE SENSE OF SETTING
20:37:37  AND FEELING 
THAT'S NECESSARY TO
20:37:40  COMMUNICATE 
WHAT IS COMPOSE
20:37:44 ED IN THE PAGE AND 
TURN
20:37:47 BULL REPORT.
>> Mayor Mei:   OKAY, THANK YOU.

20:37:51 AND AT THIS TIME I'M GOING TO 
TURN IT BACK TO THE COUNCIL
20:37:54  THEN 
FOR THE COMMENTS AND 
DELIBERATION ON THIS TOPIC
20:37:57  AND 
IF WE COULD BRING UP THAT SLIDE 
TOO, I THINK
20:38:00  BECAUSE IT TALKS 
ABOUT THE SUMMARY OF THE KEY 
CONSIDERATIONS
20:38:04 .
WHILE CERTAINLY I THINK MANY OF 
US HAVE SUPPORT FOR CO-
20:38:07 HOUSING 
AND OTHER THINGS, THAT'S NOT THE 
QUESTION FOR THIS EVENING FOR
20:38:10  
US.
THE QUESTION PERTAINS TO
20:38:13  
SPECIFICALLY AS FOLLOWS, DOES 
THE EVIDENCE SUPPORT
20:38:17  THE 
CONCLUSION THAT THE PROPERTY IS 
POTENTIAL HISTORIC
20:38:20  RESOURCE.
AND I BELIEVE THERE WAS A 
CLARIFYING QUESTION
20:38:23  FROM 
COUNCILMEMBER JONES WHICH IS IF 
WE DON'T CONSIDER IT A
20:38:26  HISTORIC 
RESOURCE THEN IT KIND OF MAKES 
THE SECOND QUESTION
20:38:30  MORE NULL 
AND VOID IN TERMS OF THE 
PROPERTY OWNER WOULD
20:38:33  HAVE MORE 
DISCRETION.
AND AS FOR THE ACTUAL 

20:38:36 DEVELOPMENT OF IT AS A 
CO-HOUSING
20:38:40  --
>> RECORDING STOPPED RECORDING
20:38:42  
IN PROGRESS.
>> Mayor Mei:   OKAY, WE'LL BE 

20:38:45 LOOKING AT THE OVERALL PLANS
20:38:48  
WHEN THEY'RE AVAILABLE.
LET'S LOOK
20:38:51  AT THE QUESTION AT 
HAND, THE SUMMARY
20:38:55  OF OVERALL 
CONCLUSION
20:38:56 S.
COUNCILMEMBER COX.
>> Councilmember Cox:   THANK 

20:39:00 YOU.
I WANTED TO UNDERSTAND, WE 
TALKED ABOUT WHETHER THE BARN
20:39:03  
WOULD COLLAPSE OR IT WOULD NOT 
HOLD UP IN ANY TYPE OF
20:39:08  SEISMIC 
ACTIONS
20:39:11  THAT OCCUR.
I'M ALSO TRYING TO UNDERSTAND.
IS THERE A
20:39:15  FIRE HAZARD AND HAS 
OUR FIRE DEPARTMENT BEEN OUT 
THERE
20:39:18  TO INSPECT AS WELL?

20:39:23 >> NOT TO MY MANY, GO.
I BELIEVE IT'S JUST THE BUILDING
20:39:26  
OFFICIAL THAT WAS SENT OUT.
>> Councilmember Cox:   OKAY
20:39:29 .
BUT THERE WAS NEVER ANYTHING 
THAT WAS EVEN
20:39:33  QUALIFIED AS A 
FIRE HAZARD?
THAT WAS
20:39:36  DETERMINED IN ANY OF 
THE REPORTS?
I NEVER SAW ANYTHING TO THAT
20:39:39  
EFFECT.
IT WAS JUST GENERALLY HAZARD AND
20:39:42  
NOT SPECIFIC IN SOME OF THE 
OTHER AREAS.

20:39:46 >> I DON'T RECALL THE STRUCTURAL 
ENGINEER THAT THE APPLICANT 
HIRED MENTION
20:39:49 ING THAT.
AND NOR WAS THAT RELATED TO
20:39:53  ME 
FROM THE PLANNING MANAGER FROM 
HIS DISCUSSIONS WITH THE
20:39:56  
BUILDING OFFICIAL.
I JUST DON'T KNOW THAT THAT -- I
20:39:59  
MEAN THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY ONE 
OF THE FINDINGS
20:40:02 , I GUESS, FOR 
EMERGENCY DEMOLITION.
MAYBE
20:40:05  I CAN PULL THAT UP HERE.
20:40:08 
>> Councilmember Cox:   YEAH 
BECAUSE USUALLY IF YOU LOOK AT 

20:40:11 BUILDINGS YOU WOULD HAVE TO HAVE 
IT AS A -- THAT WOULD BE
20:40:13  ANOTHER 
TYPE OF HAZARD.
YOU KNOW?

20:40:17 THAT WOULD BE THE SAME IF IT'S A 
HOSPITAL OR SOME OTHER TYPE OF 
BUILDING THAT
20:40:20  THAT WOULD HAVE TO 
BE CONSIDERED AS RISK OR LIFE OR 
SAFETY
20:40:24  ASSESSMENT.

20:40:27 >> YEAH AND I THINK TO THAT 
POINT THAT
20:40:30  COULD BE A 
CONSIDERATION.
I'M JUST LOOKING
20:40:33  AT BASICALLY 
THE FINDINGS AND THAT'S ON PAGE 
220
20:40:37  OF THE AGENDA PACKET WHERE 
WE HAVE THE RECOMMENDATION WITH 
THE DIFFERENT OPTIONS
20:40:40  AND THEN 
BASICALLY THE FINDING FOR 
EMERGENCY DEMOLITION
20:40:44  WOULD BE 
DEFINED AT THE POTENTIAL 
REGISTER RESOURCE
20:40:47  IF RETAINED AT 
ITS PRESENT LOCATION
20:40:51  WOULD 
CREATE A IMMEDIATE OR POTENTIAL 
HAZARD
20:40:54  TO BUILDING STRUCTURES OR 
POTENTIAL OCCUPANTS
20:40:58  OR ANIMAL ON 
ANY OR
20:41:01  ADJACENT LOT.
IT SPEAKS ABOUT IMMEDIATE OR
20:41:04  
ADJACENT HAZARD AND DOESN'T SAY 
NECESSARILY WHETHER
20:41:08  THAT'S 
SEISMIC OR FIRE OR ANYTHING 
ELSE.

20:41:11 >> Councilmember Cox:   OKAY.
I WOULD LIKE TO
20:41:14  MAKE A MOTION 
THAT IS NOT DETERMINED
20:41:18  TO BE 
HISTORICAL.
