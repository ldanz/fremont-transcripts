[Captioner] 19:10:26
PARTICULARLY PLEASED TO BE HERE IN


[Captioner] 19:10:26
FREMONT TONIGHT.


[Captioner] 19:10:28
IT WAS MANY DECADES AGO THAT MY COUSIN


[Captioner] 19:10:31

[Captioner] 19:10:31
PIMENTEL,


[Captioner] 19:10:33

[Captioner] 19:10:35
AND THAT WAS A PRETTY LONG 

[Captioner] 19:10:35
PROCLAMATION


[Captioner] 19:10:37
SO I'LL BE VERY BRIEF, SO YOU DON'T 

[Captioner] 19:10:37
HAVE


[Captioner] 19:10:40
TO STAY UNTIL 11:30 TONIGHT, I WOULD


[Captioner] 19:10:41
HOPE.


[Captioner] 19:10:45
BUT I WOULD JUST ADD A COUPLE OF 

[Captioner] 19:10:45
ALAMEDA


[Captioner] 19:10:47
COUNTY STATISTICS THAT KIND OF BRING


[Captioner] 19:10:47
HOME WHERE WE ARE.


[Captioner] 19:10:53
IN 2022, WE RESPONDED TO 239 HOME 

[Captioner] 19:10:53
FIRES,


[Captioner] 19:10:55
HELPING A TOTAL OF 425 FAMILIES.


[Captioner] 19:10:56
SOME OF THESE ARE MULTIPLE UNITS.


[Captioner] 19:11:02
AND SO FAR THIS YEAR, ALREADY, WITH 

[Captioner] 19:11:02
THE


[Captioner] 19:11:04
FLOODS, WE'VE OPENED 22 SHELTERS TO 

[Captioner] 19:11:04
HELP


[Captioner] 19:11:06
PEOPLE WHO ARE OUT OF THEIR HOMES AND


[Captioner] 19:11:06
NEEDED PLACES TO STAY.


[Captioner] 19:11:08
THAT'S JUST IN THIS COUNTY.


[Captioner] 19:11:11
THE BLOOD DRIVES ARE GOING WELL IN OUR


[Captioner] 19:11:11
COUNTY.


[Captioner] 19:11:20
WE HAVE COLLECTED, LET'S SEE, WE


[Captioner] 19:11:22

WARNINGS


[Captioner] 19:11:46

HIT YOU, SO ENCOURAGE YOU TO BE TUNED 

[Captioner] 19:11:48
IN


[Captioner] 19:11:52
AND READY, BECAUSE RESPONDING TO


[Captioner] 19:11:53
DISASTERS IS GREAT, BUT BEING PREPARED


[Captioner] 19:11:55
FOR THEM IN ADVANCE IS EVEN BETTER.


[Captioner] 19:11:58

BY THE GENERAL MANAGER, RYAN AND I


[Captioner] 19:16:18

[Captioner] 19:16:19
PRESENTATION TO BE SHARED THIS 

[Captioner] 19:16:20

THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:16:34

[Captioner] 19:16:35
ALAMEDA COUNTY MOSQUITO ABATEMENT


[Captioner] 19:16:35
DISTRICT.


[Captioner] 19:16:42
TODAY IT'S MY HONOR TO -- THE GENERAL


[Captioner] 19:16:42
MANAGER.


[Captioner] 19:16:42
RON.


[Captioner] 19:16:49
>> THERE WE GO.


[Captioner] 19:16:51
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, AND I'LL BE VERY


[Captioner] 19:16:52
BRIEF WITH MY PRESENTATION.


[Captioner] 19:16:54
THE LAST TIME I WAS HERE WAS 2019.


[Captioner] 19:16:56
SO I TRY TO COME ABOUT EVERY THREE TO


[Captioner] 19:16:57
FOUR YEARS.


[Captioner] 19:16:59
I LIKE TO THANK CITY STAFF FOR 

[Captioner] 19:16:59
ACCEPTING


[Captioner] 19:16:59
MY REQUEST TO SPEAK.


[Captioner] 19:17:01
AND I HOPE YOU FIND THIS INTERESTING.


[Captioner] 19:17:06
THE NEXT TIME ON THIS TIMETABLE MAY BE


[Captioner] 19:17:07
2027, 2028, I'LL BE BACK.


[Captioner] 19:17:13
BUT AGAIN, MY NAME IS RYAN 

[Captioner] 19:17:14
CLAUSNITZER.


[Captioner] 19:17:15
AND I'M JUST GOING TO GIVE AN UPDATE.


[Captioner] 19:17:18
FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM, 

[Captioner] 19:17:18
MAYBE


[Captioner] 19:17:20
SOME COUNCILMEMBERS DON'T REALIZE 

[Captioner] 19:17:20
THERE


[Captioner] 19:17:21
IS A MOSQUITO DISTRICT IN ALAMEDA


[Captioner] 19:17:21
COUNTY.


[Captioner] 19:17:23
WE'VE BEEN HERE ALMOST 100 YEARS.


[Captioner] 19:17:27
WHY DO WE EXIST, HOW DO WE EXIST, AND


[Captioner] 19:17:29
WHY WOULD YOU CARE ABOUT WHAT WE DO 

[Captioner] 19:17:29
AND


[Captioner] 19:17:30
WHAT YOU CAN DO TO CONTROL MOSQUITOES?


[Captioner] 19:17:32
THAT'S WHAT I'M GOING TO GO OVER TODAY


[Captioner] 19:17:33
IN ABOUT 10 MINUTES.


[Captioner] 19:17:38
SO OUR DISTRICT HAS BEEN AROUND FOR A


[Captioner] 19:17:41
LONG TIME AND IT'S MOSTLY BECAUSE OF


[Captioner] 19:17:42
THESE TWO MOSQUITOES.


[Captioner] 19:17:44
WHEN THEY MADE THE CONNECTION ABOUT 

[Captioner] 19:17:44
100


[Captioner] 19:17:45
YEARS AGO THAT MOSQUITOES ACTUALLY


[Captioner] 19:17:47
SPREAD DISEASES, THAT WAS A BIG DEAL,


[Captioner] 19:17:49
AND THEY SAID OKAY, THESE AREN'T JUST


[Captioner] 19:17:51
ANNOYING, THEY'RE ACTUALLY DEADLY, AND


[Captioner] 19:17:53
THESE TWO MOSQUITOES SPECIFICALLY ARE


[Captioner] 19:17:55
SALT MARSH MOSQUITOES, SO THEY LIVE ON


[Captioner] 19:17:57
THE OTHER SIDE OF TOWN, AND THEY WOULD


[Captioner] 19:17:59
FLY UP THROUGH FREMONT, BITING THEIR 

[Captioner] 19:18:00
WAY


[Captioner] 19:18:02
ALONG THE WAY AND FLY BACK, BITING 

[Captioner] 19:18:02
THEIR


[Captioner] 19:18:04
WAY, AND IT MADE THIS AREA REALLY


[Captioner] 19:18:05
DIFFICULT TO LIVE AND DEVELOP.


[Captioner] 19:18:08
SO FREMONT RESIDENTS ALONG WITH OTHER


[Captioner] 19:18:10
ALAMEDA COUNTY RESIDENTS FORMED THIS


[Captioner] 19:18:11
DISTRICT TO CONTROL MOSQUITOES.


[Captioner] 19:18:15
THEY ACTUALLY WENT TO THE STATE 

[Captioner] 19:18:15
BECAUSE


[Captioner] 19:18:17
OF THE TIME, IT WASN'T REALLY A CITY


[Captioner] 19:18:20
ISSUE OR A COUNTY ISSUE, THEY FORMED A


[Captioner] 19:18:20
SPECIAL DISTRICT ACT.


[Captioner] 19:18:22
SO MOST MOSQUITO DISTRICTS THROUGHOUT


[Captioner] 19:18:24
THE STATE AND THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA 

[Captioner] 19:18:24
ARE


[Captioner] 19:18:25
AN INDEPENDENT SPECIAL DISTRICT LIKE


[Captioner] 19:18:25
OURSELVES.


[Captioner] 19:18:32
AND WITH THAT, WE HAVE THE PO WE ARE 

[Captioner] 19:18:32
TO


[Captioner] 19:18:35
TAX, WE HAVE THE POWER TO ABATE AND TO


[Captioner] 19:18:37
PROPERTY, SIMILAR TO CITIES AND


[Captioner] 19:18:37
COUNTIES' AUTHORITY.


[Captioner] 19:18:40
AND WE HAVE A LARGE BOARD.


[Captioner] 19:18:42
YOU MAY WONDER WHY WE HAVE SO MANY 

[Captioner] 19:18:43
BOARD
MEMBERS.


[Captioner] 19:18:46
WELL, OUR HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE


[Captioner] 19:18:49
MENTIONS THAT WE HAVE A TRUSTEE FOR


[Captioner] 19:18:50
EVERY CITY THAT WE HAVE.


[Captioner] 19:18:54
SO THE ENTIRE COUNTY, THUS WE HAVE A


[Captioner] 19:18:56
TRUSTEE FOR EVERY CITY IN THE COUNTY,


[Captioner] 19:18:56
PLUS ONE FROM THE COUNTY THE A LARGE.


[Captioner] 19:18:58
SO YOU MAY RECOGNIZE SOME


[Captioner] 19:18:58
COUNCILMEMBERS.


[Captioner] 19:19:00
ABOUT A THIRD OF THEM ARE


[Captioner] 19:19:00
COUNCILMEMBERS.


[Captioner] 19:19:02
YOU HAVE TRUSTEE YOUNG, WHO'S


[Captioner] 19:19:05
ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONAL, AND


[Captioner] 19:19:07
ACADEMIC CITY FOLKS AND TEACHERS, SO


[Captioner] 19:19:10
IT'S A NICE MIXTURE ON OUR BOARD, AND


[Captioner] 19:19:11
THEY ARE APPOINTED BY CITY COUNCILS 

[Captioner] 19:19:12
SUCH


[Captioner] 19:19:12
AS YOURSELF.


[Captioner] 19:19:19
IF YOU'RE A PROPERTY OWNER OR YOU


[Captioner] 19:19:21
RENT, YOU MAY SEE ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF


[Captioner] 19:19:22
THE PROPERTY BILL, HOW DO WE GET OUR


[Captioner] 19:19:22
FUNDS?


[Captioner] 19:19:24
WELL, THERE'S A LITTLE LINE ITEM 

[Captioner] 19:19:24
THERE.


[Captioner] 19:19:26
SMALLEST ONE, WHICH WE'RE PROUD OF,


[Captioner] 19:19:28
MOSQUITO DISTRICT HAS THE SMALLEST


[Captioner] 19:19:31
AMOUNT THAT WE TAX, $1.74 AND $2.50.


[Captioner] 19:19:33
AND THAT ADDS UP WHEN YOU DO THE 

[Captioner] 19:19:33
ENTIRE


[Captioner] 19:19:36
COUNTY, PLUS WE GET A SHARE OF THE 

[Captioner] 19:19:36
VALUE


[Captioner] 19:19:38
OF THE PROPERTIES TO ABOUT $5 MILLION.


[Captioner] 19:19:41
WE'VE KEPT THIS THE SAME ASSESSMENT,


[Captioner] 19:19:43
EVEN THOUGH WE COULD TRIPLE IT REALLY


[Captioner] 19:19:45
SINCE 2008, WE'VE KEPT IT THE SAME FOR


[Captioner] 19:19:46
THE LAST 15, 16 YEARS.


[Captioner] 19:19:52
AND OUR REVENUE IS SOMETHING WE'RE 

[Captioner] 19:19:52
VERY
PROUD.


[Captioner] 19:19:53
IT'S ALL ON OUR WEBSITE.


[Captioner] 19:19:59
WE WORK WITH THE GFOA, GOVERNMENT


[Captioner] 19:20:01
FINANCE OFFICER ASSOCIATION SO IF 

[Captioner] 19:20:01
ANYONE


[Captioner] 19:20:02
REALLY WANTS TO KNOW HOW TO DO 

[Captioner] 19:20:03
MOSQUITO


[Captioner] 19:20:06
CONTROL FOR FIVE


[Captioner] 19:20:07
MILLION DOLLARS, THERE IT IS RIGHT 

[Captioner] 19:20:07
THERE


[Captioner] 19:20:09
ON THE WEBSITE.


[Captioner] 19:20:12
HOW WE DO MOSQUITOES, MORE OF WHY 

[Captioner] 19:20:12
SHOULD


[Captioner] 19:20:13
WE CARE ABOUT MOSQUITOES?


[Captioner] 19:20:15
THEY'RE AN AQUATIC INSECT.


[Captioner] 19:20:17
THEY SPEND MOST OF THEIR LIFE IN THE


[Captioner] 19:20:17
WATER.


[Captioner] 19:20:20
BUT UNLIKE SOME OTHERS, THEY DON'T


[Captioner] 19:20:21
BREATHE WATER, THEY NEED AIR.


[Captioner] 19:20:24
SO LIKE WE DO, SO THEY HAVE TO 

[Captioner] 19:20:24
ACTUALLY


[Captioner] 19:20:26
TRAVEL TO THE SURFACE, BREATHE AIR AND


[Captioner] 19:20:27
THEN GO BACK UNDER WATER.


[Captioner] 19:20:34
AND THEY HAVE A COMPLETE LIKE A


[Captioner] 19:20:37
BUTTERFLY, BUT PART OF THAT WHEN THEY


[Captioner] 19:20:39
EMERGE AS ADULTS, THEY MATE AND THEY


[Captioner] 19:20:39
HUNT.


[Captioner] 19:20:41
THEY NEED BLOOD.


[Captioner] 19:20:44
SO ANY TIME YOU EVER GET ATTACKED BY A


[Captioner] 19:20:45
MOSQUITO, YOU'RE ONLY GETTING ATTACKED


[Captioner] 19:20:46
BY FEMALE MOSQUITOES.


[Captioner] 19:20:49
LIKE OTHER ANIMALS IN THE ANIMAL


[Captioner] 19:20:50
KINGDOM, THE FEMALES ARE THE ONES THAT


[Captioner] 19:20:50
HUNT.


[Captioner] 19:20:54
THE MALES EMERGE, LOOK PRETTY, AND 

[Captioner] 19:20:54
THEN


[Captioner] 19:20:57
THE FEMALES GO OUT AND GRAB THE BLOOD


[Captioner] 19:20:57
AND CREATE MORE EGGS.


[Captioner] 19:21:02
SO MALES DON'T EVEN HAVE THE ANATOMY 

[Captioner] 19:21:02
TO
BITE.


[Captioner] 19:21:05
AS YOU CAN SEE HERE, THEY HAVE -- THE


[Captioner] 19:21:12
MALES HAVE A  FEATHERY ANTENNA


[Captioner] 19:21:13
AND THE FEMALES HAVE A POINTER.


[Captioner] 19:21:16
EVERY TIME THEY BITE YOU, THEY KIND OF


[Captioner] 19:21:17
RELEASE THE LAST PERSON THEY BIT, A


[Captioner] 19:21:20
LITTLE BIT OF THEIR SALIVA, KIND OF 

[Captioner] 19:21:20
LIKE


[Captioner] 19:21:22
SHARING NEEDLES, IF YOU WILL, AND 

[Captioner] 19:21:22
THAT'S


[Captioner] 19:21:23
HOW DISEASES SPREAD WITH MOSQUITOES.


[Captioner] 19:21:29
AND YOU'LL SEE -- STANDING WATER, SO


[Captioner] 19:21:30
AGAIN, THEY NEED TO BREATHE AIR AND 

[Captioner] 19:21:31
THEY


[Captioner] 19:21:33
CAN'T BREATHE AIR IN REALLY ROUGH


[Captioner] 19:21:35
WATERS, THEY NEED STAGNANT WATER.


[Captioner] 19:21:41
SO YOU'LL SEE THEM IN A LOT OF SALT


[Captioner] 19:21:43
MARSHES, SWIMMING POOLS, THIS YEAR


[Captioner] 19:21:45
YOU'LL SEE WATER EVERYWHERE SO WE'RE


[Captioner] 19:21:46
SPENDING A LOT OF TIME LOOKING AT 

[Captioner] 19:21:47
THESE


[Captioner] 19:21:47
DIFFERENT SOURCES.


[Captioner] 19:21:49
BUT I'M GOING TO TOUCH A LOT OF THIS


[Captioner] 19:21:50
PRESENTATION REALLY ON NEW MOSQUITOES


[Captioner] 19:21:51
COMING TO CALIFORNIA.


[Captioner] 19:21:52
THEY'RE JUST OVER THE BORDER.


[Captioner] 19:21:57
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU SAW THE NEWS A FEW


[Captioner] 19:22:02
MONTHS AGO IN MILIPITAS, IT CAME OVER 

[Captioner] 19:22:02
IN


[Captioner] 19:22:04
1492, BUT IT HAS NEVER BEEN IN


[Captioner] 19:22:05
CALIFORNIA UNTIL ABOUT 10 YEARS AGO 

[Captioner] 19:22:06
AND


[Captioner] 19:22:07
IT'S NEVER BEEN IN ALAMEDA COUNTY, BUT


[Captioner] 19:22:09
IT WAS IN MILIPITAS.


[Captioner] 19:22:11
WE TRAPPED IT JUST OVER THE FREMONT


[Captioner] 19:22:12
BORDER AND WHAT SCARES US ABOUT THIS


[Captioner] 19:22:14
MOSQUITO IS IT DOESN'T NEED ALL THESE


[Captioner] 19:22:17
LARGE MARSHES, IT JUST NEEDS A BOTTLE


[Captioner] 19:22:18
CAP OF WATER.


[Captioner] 19:22:20
AND IT SPREADS DISEASES IN AMERICA YOU


[Captioner] 19:22:20
COULDN'T GET BEFORE.


[Captioner] 19:22:22
SOMETHING YOU'D HAVE TO TRAVEL TO GET


[Captioner] 19:22:26
LIKE DENGUE FEVER, ZIKA, YELLOW FEVER,


[Captioner] 19:22:27
CHIKUNGUNYA, AND THAT'S WHY I WANTED 

[Captioner] 19:22:28
TO


[Captioner] 19:22:32
COME BACK TO YOU AND TALK TO YOU ABOUT


[Captioner] 19:22:34
THIS SO DON'T CALL THE PRIVATE SECTOR,


[Captioner] 19:22:36
YOU'VE ALREADY PAID FOR IT, AND WE'RE


[Captioner] 19:22:38
VERY AWARE OF IT AND I'M GOING TO SHOW


[Captioner] 19:22:39
YOU HOW WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO CONTROL


[Captioner] 19:22:39
THIS.


[Captioner] 19:22:45
SO THIS MOSQUITO IS INDEMIC IN


[Captioner] 19:22:46
CALIFORNIA, BUT THESE OTHER MOSQUITOES


[Captioner] 19:22:49
ARE MORE CONTAINERS, SO WE LOOK IN


[Captioner] 19:22:53
CEMETERIES, WE LOOK IN LITTLE 

[Captioner] 19:22:53
VERMILION


[Captioner] 19:22:56
PLANTS, DISHES BENEATH FLOWER POTS,


[Captioner] 19:22:57
TIRES, THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT WE'RE


[Captioner] 19:22:59
REALLY LOOKING FOR IN THIS KIND OF


[Captioner] 19:22:59
MOSQUITO.


[Captioner] 19:23:03
AND WHY RESIDENTS CALL US, YOU KNOW, A


[Captioner] 19:23:05
LOT OF IT, YOU MAY SEE THIS BLUE 

[Captioner] 19:23:05
COLOR.


[Captioner] 19:23:06
WHY IS IT SO BLUE?


[Captioner] 19:23:07
THAT'S MOSQUITOFISH.


[Captioner] 19:23:09
ONE WAY TO CONTROL MOSQUITOES IS 

[Captioner] 19:23:09
THROUGH
FISH.


[Captioner] 19:23:12
SO IT'S A VERY NATURAL WAY TO DO IT, 

[Captioner] 19:23:12
AND


[Captioner] 19:23:14
IF YOU EVER HAVE A POND IN YOUR


[Captioner] 19:23:16
BACKYARD, JUST GIVE US A CALL AND 

[Captioner] 19:23:16
WE'LL


[Captioner] 19:23:18
COME OUT THERE THAT DAY WITH FISH THAT


[Captioner] 19:23:19
WE GROW IN OUR PLACE IN HAYWARD.


[Captioner] 19:23:24
THIS IS US WORKING TO CONTROL THE 

[Captioner] 19:23:25
NATIVE


[Captioner] 19:23:26
MOSQUITOES IN THE SALT MARSHES.


[Captioner] 19:23:28
ON THE MARSH THAT WE WORK WITH U.S. 

[Captioner] 19:23:29
FISH


[Captioner] 19:23:32
AND WILDLIFE, AND WE CLEAN OUT THESE


[Captioner] 19:23:33
DITCHES BY HAND WITH SHOVELS TO MAKE


[Captioner] 19:23:35
SURE THE TIDE DOES THE WORK FOR US SO 

[Captioner] 19:23:35
WE


[Captioner] 19:23:37
DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE TO DO A LOT OF


[Captioner] 19:23:38
MOSQUITO CONTROL IF NATURE DOES THE 

[Captioner] 19:23:38
WORK


[Captioner] 19:23:39
FOR US.


[Captioner] 19:23:42
AND THERE'S THE FISH I WAS MENTIONING.


[Captioner] 19:23:46
YOU'LL SEE THESE LITTLE GUPPIES, A 

[Captioner] 19:23:46
VERY


[Captioner] 19:23:48
POPULAR WAY TO INTERACT WITH THE 

[Captioner] 19:23:49
PUBLIC


[Captioner] 19:23:49
AND VERY EFFECTIVE.


[Captioner] 19:23:51
WE ALSO FIND A WAY TO GET INTO VERY 

[Captioner] 19:23:51
HARD


[Captioner] 19:23:52
TO REACH AREAS.


[Captioner] 19:23:53
WE USE DRONES.


[Captioner] 19:23:57
AND IN THE OLD DAYS, WE'D USE


[Captioner] 19:23:59
HELICOPTERS, BUT HELICOPTERS ARE VERY


[Captioner] 19:24:01
LARGE, EXPENSIVE AND THEY PUT THE


[Captioner] 19:24:01
PESTICIDES EVERYWHERE.


[Captioner] 19:24:06
DRONES, UNMANNED AERIAL SYSTEMS ARE 

[Captioner] 19:24:07
VERY


[Captioner] 19:24:10
PRECISE, SO YOU'LL SEE THAT USAGE MORE


[Captioner] 19:24:11
IN FAR-OFF LOCATIONS.


[Captioner] 19:24:15
OCCASIONALLY, THOUGH, WE DO HAVE TO


[Captioner] 19:24:15
FOG.


[Captioner] 19:24:18
THAT'S WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT ADULTING


[Captioner] 19:24:21
CONTROL OF MOSQUITOES, YOU THINK ABOUT


[Captioner] 19:24:21
FOGGING.


[Captioner] 19:24:23
THE LAST TIME WE DID THAT WAS IN 2018 

[Captioner] 19:24:24
IN


[Captioner] 19:24:25
UNION CITY, WE PUT A LITTLE BIT OUT.


[Captioner] 19:24:27
WE FOUND BIRDS.


[Captioner] 19:24:30
BIRDS ARE AFFECTED WITH WEST NILE 

[Captioner] 19:24:31
VIRUS,


[Captioner] 19:24:32
THEY'RE DISEASED, MOSQUITOES, SO WE 

[Captioner] 19:24:32
HAD


[Captioner] 19:24:35
TO DO A QUICK CONTROL METHOD RIGHT BY


[Captioner] 19:24:36
ALAMEDA CREEK IN UNION CITY BUT THAT'S


[Captioner] 19:24:37
THE LAST TIME, IT'S BEEN ABOUT SIX


[Captioner] 19:24:38
YEARS.


[Captioner] 19:24:40
BUT IF YOU DO THINK OF MOSQUITO 

[Captioner] 19:24:40
CONTROL


[Captioner] 19:24:42
IN THE PAST, THAT'S WHAT WE USUALLY


[Captioner] 19:24:43
THINK ABOUT, IS KNOCKING DOWN DISEASED


[Captioner] 19:24:44
MOSQUITOES BEFORE THEY BITE US.


[Captioner] 19:24:50
AND AGAIN, IN OUR LAB, WE'VE SEEN 

[Captioner] 19:24:50
ABOUT


[Captioner] 19:24:52
TESTING MOSQUITOES, EVERY TIME THE


[Captioner] 19:24:54
PUBLIC -- YOU FIND A DEAD BIRD, CALL 

[Captioner] 19:24:54
US,


[Captioner] 19:24:55
WE'LL PICK THEM UP.


[Captioner] 19:24:58
BIRDS ARE A NATURAL SENTINEL FOR


[Captioner] 19:24:59
DISEASES, AN OMEN, IF YOU WILL.


[Captioner] 19:25:00
IN THE OLD DAYS, YOU'D THINK ABOUT 

[Captioner] 19:25:01
BIRDS


[Captioner] 19:25:01
FALLING OUT OF THE SKY.


[Captioner] 19:25:04
WE COLLECT THESE BIRDS AND WE TEST 

[Captioner] 19:25:04
THEM


[Captioner] 19:25:07
WITH QPCR MACHINES, THE SAME MACHINES


[Captioner] 19:25:09
YOU PROBABLY ARE AWARE OF FROM 

[Captioner] 19:25:09
COVID-19


[Captioner] 19:25:11
TESTS, WE USE THE SAME THING TO TEST 

[Captioner] 19:25:11
FOR


[Captioner] 19:25:13
BIRDS AND WE ALSO TEST MOSQUITOES IN 

[Captioner] 19:25:13
OUR


[Captioner] 19:25:15
LAB IN HAYWARD AS WELL.


[Captioner] 19:25:18
NOW TO EVENT IN FREMONT, WHENEVER


[Captioner] 19:25:20
THERE'S AN EVENT, YOU'LL SEE US ON THE


[Captioner] 19:25:21
STREET JUST LETTING THE PUBLIC KNOW


[Captioner] 19:25:23
THAT, AGAIN, THE SERVICE IS ALREADY


[Captioner] 19:25:25
PROVIDED FOR SO YOU CAN CALL US UP,


[Captioner] 19:25:27
WE'LL TAKE CARE OF IT IN A VERY


[Captioner] 19:25:28
ECOLOGICALLY SAFE AND SUSTAINABLE


[Captioner] 19:25:28
MANNER.


[Captioner] 19:25:33
AND A LOT OF THE LAND ESPECIALLY ON 

[Captioner] 19:25:33
THE


[Captioner] 19:25:36
WESTERN SIDE OF THE CITY IS OWNED BY 

[Captioner] 19:25:36
THE


[Captioner] 19:25:37
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, OTHER AGENCIES.


[Captioner] 19:25:40
WE HAVE TO WORK WITH THE LAND OWNERS 

[Captioner] 19:25:40
ON


[Captioner] 19:25:40
HOW TO DO THIS AS WELL.


[Captioner] 19:25:45
AND WE ALSO HAVE A FULLY FUNCTIONING


[Captioner] 19:25:46
LABORATORY, SO WHENEVER WE DO WORK, WE


[Captioner] 19:25:48
WANT TO MAKE SURE IT WORKS, SO WE DO A


[Captioner] 19:25:51
LOT OF PEER REVIEWED JOURNALS,


[Captioner] 19:25:52
PARTNERING WITH LOCAL UNIVERSITIES AND


[Captioner] 19:25:54
DOING RESEARCH TO SEE THAT -- TO PROVE


[Captioner] 19:25:56
THAT THE WORK WE'RE DOING IS EFFECTIVE


[Captioner] 19:25:56
AND EFFICIENT.


[Captioner] 19:26:00
SUCH AS DOING WORK IN HEALTH EQUITY.


[Captioner] 19:26:02
SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I WAS REALLY


[Captioner] 19:26:04
CONCERNED ABOUT, IS KNOWING SOME 

[Captioner] 19:26:04
PEOPLE


[Captioner] 19:26:08
MAY NOT KNOW THAT WE EXIST SO THEY MAY


[Captioner] 19:26:10
CALL SOMEONE ELSE TO PAY, A SERVICE, 

[Captioner] 19:26:10
FOR


[Captioner] 19:26:10
MOSQUITO CONTROL.


[Captioner] 19:26:12
YOU DON'T HAVE TO PAY A SERVICE FOR


[Captioner] 19:26:13
MOSQUITO CONTROL.


[Captioner] 19:26:15
YOU'VE ALREADY PAID $4 A YEAR SO THAT


[Captioner] 19:26:16
SHOULD COVER IT.


[Captioner] 19:26:18
SO WE CAN COME OUT AND PROVIDE THIS.


[Captioner] 19:26:21
BUT SOME PEOPLE DON'T KNOW SO WE 

[Captioner] 19:26:21
REALLY


[Captioner] 19:26:22
IDENTIFIED THROUGH SURVEYS AND 

[Captioner] 19:26:23
OUTREACH,


[Captioner] 19:26:25
WHO DOESN'T KNOW THAT WE EXIST, AND


[Captioner] 19:26:26
THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS I'M HERE


[Captioner] 19:26:27
TODAY, IS TO LET YOU KNOW AS COUNCIL 

[Captioner] 19:26:27
AND


[Captioner] 19:26:29
THE RESIDENTS THAT ARE PRESENT, THAT


[Captioner] 19:26:30
THERE IS A MOSQUITO CONTROL DISTRICT 

[Captioner] 19:26:30
AND


[Captioner] 19:26:34
WE DO THE WORK TO CONTROL MOSQUITOES 

[Captioner] 19:26:34
AND


[Captioner] 19:26:35
IDENTIFY SERVICE GAPS.


[Captioner] 19:26:37
ALL RIGHT.


[Captioner] 19:26:40
THE LAST LITTLE BIT OF THIS, THE LAST


[Captioner] 19:26:41
FEW SLIDES IS WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT


[Captioner] 19:26:43
BEFORE, ABOUT THIS NEW MOSQUITO THAT 

[Captioner] 19:26:43
HAS


[Captioner] 19:26:45
BEEN AROUND THE WORLD, BUT IT'S SLOWLY


[Captioner] 19:26:48
COMING TO THE COUNCIL TEAL, IT'S IN


[Captioner] 19:26:51
MARTINEZ, IT'S IN TRACY, AND IT'S IN


[Captioner] 19:26:52
MILIPITAS, BUT IT'S NOT IN ALAMEDA


[Captioner] 19:26:52
COUNTY.


[Captioner] 19:26:54
SO HOW ARE WE GOING TO GET RID OF THIS


[Captioner] 19:26:54
THING?


[Captioner] 19:26:56
IT'S BEEN IN CALIFORNIA LIKE I 

[Captioner] 19:26:56
MENTIONED


[Captioner] 19:26:58
ABOUT 10 YEARS, AND THANKFULLY OTHER


[Captioner] 19:26:59
PLACES HAVE TRIED IT FIRST, SO THROUGH


[Captioner] 19:27:02
TRIAL AND ERROR, WE KNOW WHAT WORKS


[Captioner] 19:27:04
BETTER.


[Captioner] 19:27:06
SO THERE'S REALLY THREE NEW METHODS OF


[Captioner] 19:27:08
CONTROLLING MOSQUITOES RATHER THAN THE


[Captioner] 19:27:11
TRADITIONAL SPRAYING OR PESTICIDE USE


[Captioner] 19:27:13
THAT DOESN'T REALLY WORK WHEN WE'RE


[Captioner] 19:27:16
TALKING ABOUT BOTTLE CAPS AND PLANT


[Captioner] 19:27:16
SAUCERS.


[Captioner] 19:27:18
THIS IS BEING DONE IN ORANGE COUNTY


[Captioner] 19:27:21
CURRENTLY AND IT'S ALSO BEEN DONE IN


[Captioner] 19:27:24
FORT MYERS, FLORIDA AND THROUGHOUT THE


[Captioner] 19:27:26
COUNTRY, OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY, 

[Captioner] 19:27:26
IS


[Captioner] 19:27:28
YOU ACTUALLY TAKE MOSQUITOES, YOU GROW


[Captioner] 19:27:32
THEM YOURSELF, AND THEN YOU ZAP THEM


[Captioner] 19:27:34
WITH X-RAYS AND MAKE THEM STERILE.


[Captioner] 19:27:36
THEN YOU ONLY RELEASE THE MALES, 

[Captioner] 19:27:36
BECAUSE


[Captioner] 19:27:39
THE FEMALES BITE SO YOU DON'T WANT TO,


[Captioner] 19:27:41
LIKE -- WE'RE MOSQUITO ABATEMENT, NOT


[Captioner] 19:27:43
MOSQUITO GROWTH SO WE ONLY RELEASE THE


[Captioner] 19:27:45
MALES, THE MALES GO OUT THERE AND THEN


[Captioner] 19:27:48
THE NATIVE MOSQUITOES MATE WITH THE --


[Captioner] 19:27:50
THE FEMALE MATE WITH THE MALE, 

[Captioner] 19:27:50
THINKING


[Captioner] 19:27:51
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE OFFSPRING BUT


[Captioner] 19:27:53
SINCE THE MALES HAVE BEEN STERILIZED,


[Captioner] 19:27:54
THERE'S NO OFFSPRING.


[Captioner] 19:27:57
SO SLOWLY AS YOU DO THIS OVER TIME, 

[Captioner] 19:27:58
THE


[Captioner] 19:27:58
POPULATION DECLINES.


[Captioner] 19:28:00
IT'S VERY EXPENSIVE PROCESS.


[Captioner] 19:28:04
YOU HAVE TO RAISE MILLIONS OF 

[Captioner] 19:28:04
MOSQUITOES


[Captioner] 19:28:06
AND SORT THEM BY SEX AND THEN PUT THEM


[Captioner] 19:28:09
THROUGH AN X-RAY MACHINE, BUT IT


[Captioner] 19:28:10
SEEMS -- IT WORKS.


[Captioner] 19:28:15
IT WORKS FOR AGRICULTURAL PESTS AND


[Captioner] 19:28:15
MOSQUITOES AS WELL.


[Captioner] 19:28:18
SO SOMETHING THAT L.A. COUNTY, ORANGE


[Captioner] 19:28:20
COUNTY IS PILOTING AND WE MAY LOOK AT


[Captioner] 19:28:20
THAT SOMETIME SOON.


[Captioner] 19:28:21
SEVERAL YEARS DOWN THE ROAD.


[Captioner] 19:28:28
ANOTHER METHOD IS -- IT'S WOLBACHIA, A


[Captioner] 19:28:31
NATURAL BACTERIA FOR MOSQUITOES AND IT


[Captioner] 19:28:33
CREATES CYTOPLASMIC INCOMPATIBILITY.


[Captioner] 19:28:34
BASICALLY THE OFFSPRING CAN'T MATE.


[Captioner] 19:28:38
SO THIS WAS PILOTED BY -- FUNDED 

[Captioner] 19:28:38
THROUGH


[Captioner] 19:28:42
ACTUALLY GOOGLE OR VERILY OR ALPHABET,


[Captioner] 19:28:43
WHATEVER THEIR CORPORATE NAME IS, IN


[Captioner] 19:28:44
FRESNO.


[Captioner] 19:28:45
THEY DID THIS LARGE PROJECT WHERE THEY


[Captioner] 19:28:48
WOULD RELEASE MALES AGAIN, NOT 

[Captioner] 19:28:48
STERILIZE


[Captioner] 19:28:50
THIS TIME BUT INFECT WITH BACTERIA, 

[Captioner] 19:28:50
THEN


[Captioner] 19:28:51
OVER TIME, THE POPULATION GOES DOWN.


[Captioner] 19:28:56
SO THAT WAS EFFECTIVE, IT  JUST --


[Captioner] 19:28:58
YOU NEED AN EPA PERMIT TO BE ABLE TO BE


[Captioner] 19:28:59
WIDESPREAD BUT THIS HAS BEEN DONE IN


[Captioner] 19:29:01
OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD AND WITHIN


[Captioner] 19:29:02
CALIFORNIA AND THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY 

[Captioner] 19:29:02
AS
WELL.


[Captioner] 19:29:03
SO ANOTHER OPTION.


[Captioner] 19:29:08
AND THE LAST OPTION IS ACTUALLY


[Captioner] 19:29:09
GENETICALLY MODIFIED MOSQUITO.


[Captioner] 19:29:12
THERE'S A COMPANY CALLED OXYTECH THAT


[Captioner] 19:29:20
HAS  PATENTED AND MARKETED THIS,


[Captioner] 19:29:22
MODIFYING THE FEMALE MOSQUITOES TO BE


[Captioner] 19:29:25
DEPENDENT ON A CERTAIN KIND OF


[Captioner] 19:29:27
ANTIBIOTIC, YOU ADD WATER TO A BOX AND


[Captioner] 19:29:29
ONLY MALE MOSQUITOES FLY OFF AND 

[Captioner] 19:29:29
WITHIN


[Captioner] 19:29:30
TIME, AGAIN, THE POPULATION WILL


[Captioner] 19:29:30
DECREASE.


[Captioner] 19:29:33
SO THIS HAS ONLY BEEN DONE ONCE IN THE


[Captioner] 19:29:34
UNITED STATES IN THE FLORIDA KEYS.


[Captioner] 19:29:41
THEY WERE WORKING TO GET IT DONE IN


[Captioner] 19:29:44
VISALEA AS A PILOT, WE'RE TALKING 

[Captioner] 19:29:44
ABOUT


[Captioner] 19:29:46
A DECADE, BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW IF


[Captioner] 19:29:47
RESIDENTS IN FREMONT EVER HEAR ABOUT


[Captioner] 19:29:48
THESE THINGS, CALL US.


[Captioner] 19:29:51
WE'RE THE RESOURCE, MOSQUITOES.ORG, 

[Captioner] 19:29:52
EASY


[Captioner] 19:29:53
TO REMEMBER, AND WE'LL BE HAPPY TO 

[Captioner] 19:29:53
TALK


[Captioner] 19:29:55
TO YOU ABOUT ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS


[Captioner] 19:29:56
YOU HAVE ABOUT MOSQUITOES OR THE


[Captioner] 19:29:57
PRODUCTS WE USE.


[Captioner] 19:29:59
AND I THINK THAT'S MY LAST SLIDE.


[Captioner] 19:30:02
SO AGAIN, I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR


[Captioner] 19:30:02
TIME.


[Captioner] 19:30:04
SORRY I WENT A LITTLE OVER 10 MINUTES,


[Captioner] 19:30:06
BUT I'M ALWAYS AVAILABLE, AT YOUR


[Captioner] 19:30:07
SERVICE, AND I'M ALWAYS AVAILABLE TO


[Captioner] 19:30:08
MAKE FUTURE PRESENTATIONS.


[Captioner] 19:30:18
THANK YOU


[Captioner] 19:30:19
>> Mayor Mei: DO WE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS


[Captioner] 19:30:20
FROM THE COUNCILMEMBERS?


[Captioner] 19:30:26
ALBERTO, IF YOU COULD HELP ME?


[Captioner] 19:30:27
>> Ms. Gauthier: COUNCILMEMBER


[Captioner] 19:30:28
CAMPBELL HAS HER HAND RAISED.


[Captioner] 19:30:30
QUESTIONS.


[Captioner] 19:30:31
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:30:32
>> Councilmember Campbell: HI.


[Captioner] 19:30:33
THANK YOU FOR THAT PRESENTATION.


[Captioner] 19:30:34
ACTUALLY IT WAS VERY INTERESTING.


[Captioner] 19:30:38
I FIND THAT I LEARNED SOMETHING NEW


[Captioner] 19:30:39
ABOUT SOME INSECTS.


[Captioner] 19:30:40
THAT I HADN'T KNOWN BEFORE.


[Captioner] 19:30:44
I'VE GOT A COUPLE QUICK QUESTIONS.


[Captioner] 19:30:48
YOU SAID YOU DO -- DO YOU COME OUT TO


[Captioner] 19:30:49
INDIVIDUAL HOMES TO ABATE?


[Captioner] 19:30:50
>> MM-HMM.


[Captioner] 19:30:50
>> Councilmember Campbell: OH.


[Captioner] 19:30:53
AND THAT'S AT NO COST TO THE 

[Captioner] 19:30:53
HOMEOWNER?


[Captioner] 19:30:54
>> NO, NO COST.


[Captioner] 19:30:55
>> Councilmember Campbell: OKAY,


[Captioner] 19:30:55
GREAT.


[Captioner] 19:30:56
THAT IS REALLY GOOD NEWS.


[Captioner] 19:30:59
YOU TALKED A LOT ABOUT THE DOWNSIDES 

[Captioner] 19:30:59
OF
MOSQUITOES.


[Captioner] 19:31:02
ARE THERE ANY UPSIDES TO HAVING


[Captioner] 19:31:03
MOSQUITOES ON THE PLANET?


[Captioner] 19:31:07
>> WELL, THEY ARE A PART OF THE FOOD


[Captioner] 19:31:09
CHAIN, BUT THERE'S ABOUT 50-SOME


[Captioner] 19:31:11
SPECIES, SO IF WE JUST CONTROLLED -- 

[Captioner] 19:31:12
ALL


[Captioner] 19:31:13
THESE TECHNOLOGIES, THE SCI-FI


[Captioner] 19:31:14
TECHNOLOGIES I WAS TALKING ABOUT, THAT


[Captioner] 19:31:16
WAS FOCUSING ON ONE MOSQUITO THAT WE


[Captioner] 19:31:17
DON'T EVEN HAVE HERE YET.


[Captioner] 19:31:19
SO EVEN IF WE CONTROLLED THAT, THERE


[Captioner] 19:31:21
WOULD STILL BE A LOT OF OTHER 

[Captioner] 19:31:21
MOSQUITOES
HERE.


[Captioner] 19:31:24
SO I THINK ANY TIME -- YOU NEVER WANT 

[Captioner] 19:31:24
TO


[Captioner] 19:31:26
MESS WITH NATURE TOO MUCH.


[Captioner] 19:31:29
YOU KNOW, THERE IS A PLACE FOR 

[Captioner] 19:31:29
MOSQUITO


[Captioner] 19:31:31
IN NATURE, BUT WE'RE A MOSQUITO


[Captioner] 19:31:33
ABATEMENT DISTRICT, WE'RE NOT A 

[Captioner] 19:31:33
MOSQUITO


[Captioner] 19:31:35
ERADICATION DISTRICT FOR THAT REASON 

[Captioner] 19:31:35
SO


[Captioner] 19:31:36
WE WILL NEVER GET RID OF IT, EVEN IF 

[Captioner] 19:31:36
WE


[Captioner] 19:31:37
WANTED TO, WE COULDN'T DO IT.


[Captioner] 19:31:40
SO YES, I DO BELIEVE THAT YOU DO NEED 

[Captioner] 19:31:40
A


[Captioner] 19:31:42
PLACE FOR INSECTS IN THE WORLD, BUT WE


[Captioner] 19:31:43
JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE IT'S AT A LEVEL


[Captioner] 19:31:47
THAT IS NOT HARMFUL TO HUMANS, TO 

[Captioner] 19:31:47
OTHER
ANIMALS.


[Captioner] 19:31:49
HEART WORM IS SPREAD BY MOSQUITOES, 

[Captioner] 19:31:49
AND


[Captioner] 19:31:51
A WAY THAT WE CAN HAVE A HEALTHY LIFE


[Captioner] 19:31:51
HERE.


[Captioner] 19:31:53
SO YEAH, THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.


[Captioner] 19:31:56
AND YES, AGAIN, RESIDENTS, JUST CALL 

[Captioner] 19:31:56
US
UP.


[Captioner] 19:31:58
MOSQUITO.ORG IS THE EASIEST WAY, WE'LL


[Captioner] 19:32:01
BE OUT THERE THE NEXT DAY.


[Captioner] 19:32:03
WE DON'T LOOK TO SPRAY TO CONTROL THEM


[Captioner] 19:32:05
THAT DAY, WE LOOK TO FIND WHERE 

[Captioner] 19:32:05
THEY'RE


[Captioner] 19:32:06
LIVING AND GET RID OF THAT SOURCE.


[Captioner] 19:32:08
A LOT OF TIMES MAYBE IT'S A BACKYARD,


[Captioner] 19:32:10
SOMEONE LAS A BIRD BATH THAT THEY LET 

[Captioner] 19:32:11
GO


[Captioner] 19:32:12
OR JUST CLUTTER AND WE JUST KIND OF 

[Captioner] 19:32:12
WORK


[Captioner] 19:32:14
WITH THE PROPERTY OWNER LIKE, JUST, 

[Captioner] 19:32:14
FLIP


[Captioner] 19:32:16
IT OVER, GET RID OF THE WATER, PROBLEM


[Captioner] 19:32:16
SOLVED.


[Captioner] 19:32:18
THAT'S USUALLY WHAT THE CASE IS.


[Captioner] 19:32:19
>> Councilmember Campbell: OKAY.


[Captioner] 19:32:21
I'M ACTUALLY ALLERGIC TO MOSQUITOES, 

[Captioner] 19:32:21
AND


[Captioner] 19:32:23
THEY SEEM TO LIKE ME A LOT.


[Captioner] 19:32:24
>> YES.


[Captioner] 19:32:25
>> Councilmember Campbell: AND SO I


[Captioner] 19:32:28
HAVE TO -- EVERY SUMMER I HAVE TO GO 

[Captioner] 19:32:28
GET


[Captioner] 19:32:30
MOSQUITO REPELLENT BANDS AND I WEAR 

[Captioner] 19:32:30
THEM


[Captioner] 19:32:33
ON MY ANKLES AND SOMETIMES ON MY WRIST


[Captioner] 19:32:38
BECAUSE WHEN THEY BITE, I JUST GET


[Captioner] 19:32:39
REALLY SICK AFTERWARDS.


[Captioner] 19:32:42
SO IS THERE ANY SUGGESTION THAT YOU 

[Captioner] 19:32:42
CAN


[Captioner] 19:32:45
GIVE ME TO KEEP FROM BEING ATTACKED BY


[Captioner] 19:32:45
MOSQUITOES?


[Captioner] 19:32:47
I MEAN, EVERY TIME I GO TO THE EAST


[Captioner] 19:32:50
COAST IN THE SUMMER, IT'S LIKE, FRESH


[Captioner] 19:32:50
MEAT!


[Captioner] 19:32:54
SO THEY JUST FIND ME AND THEY REALLY 

[Captioner] 19:32:54
--


[Captioner] 19:32:55
I REALLY GET SICK.


[Captioner] 19:32:57
>> WELL, IF THEY'RE EVER BITING YOU


[Captioner] 19:32:59
HERE, GIVE US A CALL, AND WE'LL TAKE


[Captioner] 19:32:59
CARE OF IT.


[Captioner] 19:33:02
YOU KNOW, WE GET CALLS EVERY DAY OF


[Captioner] 19:33:04
PEOPLE SAYING, I CAN'T HAVE A PICNIC,


[Captioner] 19:33:06
I'M GETTING BITTEN BY MOSQUITOES AND


[Captioner] 19:33:11
WE'LL SEND A PIE R


[Captioner] 19:33:12
BIOLOGIST OUT THERE AND THEY'LL GO 

[Captioner] 19:33:13
DOOR


[Captioner] 19:33:14
TO DOOR TO FIND OUT WHERE THEY'RE 

[Captioner] 19:33:14
COMING


[Captioner] 19:33:17
FROM AND THEY WON'T STOP UNTIL THEY 

[Captioner] 19:33:17
GET


[Captioner] 19:33:17
RID OF THEM.


[Captioner] 19:33:20
WHEN YOU'RE USING A REPELLENT, YOU'RE


[Captioner] 19:33:22
JUST ACTUALLY MASKING YOUR OWN ODORS


[Captioner] 19:33:24
THAT WE CAN'T EVEN SMELL, WE CAN'T 

[Captioner] 19:33:24
EVEN


[Captioner] 19:33:24
NOTICE IT.


[Captioner] 19:33:26
SO THAT'S WHAT A REPELLENT DOES.


[Captioner] 19:33:29
THERE'S LEMON EUCALYPTUS OIL, WHICH IS 

[Captioner] 19:33:29
A


[Captioner] 19:33:31
MORE NATURAL SMELLING, THEN THERE'S 

[Captioner] 19:33:32
DEET


[Captioner] 19:33:33
OR OFF, WHICH IS ANOTHER WAY AS WELL.


[Captioner] 19:33:35
SO IT REALLY WORKS, BUT THERE ARE SOME


[Captioner] 19:33:36
THAT ACTUALLY HAVE -- ARE PROVEN TO 

[Captioner] 19:33:37
WORK


[Captioner] 19:33:38
BETTER THAN OTHERS, SO I'LL BE HAPPY 

[Captioner] 19:33:38
TO


[Captioner] 19:33:39
GIVE YOU INFORMATION.


[Captioner] 19:33:41



[Captioner] 19:33:41
>> Councilmember Campbell: THANK YOU


[Captioner] 19:33:42
SO MUCH.


[Captioner] 19:33:43
>> THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:33:44
>> Ms. Gauthier: COUNCILMEMBER


[Captioner] 19:33:44
SALWAN.


[Captioner] 19:33:46
>> Councilmember Salwan: I JUST WANTED


[Captioner] 19:33:47
TO COMMEND YOU ON MAKING MOSQUITOES


[Captioner] 19:33:48
SOUND INTERESTING.


[Captioner] 19:33:49
[LAUGHTER]


[Captioner] 19:33:51
>> THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:33:54
>> Councilmember Salwan: ACTUALLY --


[Captioner] 19:33:55
I'M A VETERINARIAN SO I KNOW 

[Captioner] 19:33:55
MOSQUITOES


[Captioner] 19:33:56
CAUSE A LOT OF DISEASES.


[Captioner] 19:33:58
WE'RE LUCKY HERE IN CALIFORNIA THAT WE


[Captioner] 19:34:02
DON'T HAVE AS MANY, BUT LIKE HEARTWORM


[Captioner] 19:34:03
IS RAMPANT IN THE SOUTHEAST, SO I


[Captioner] 19:34:04
APPRECIATE ALL THE WORK THAT YOU GUYS


[Captioner] 19:34:04
DO.


[Captioner] 19:34:05
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:34:05
>> APPRECIATE.


[Captioner] 19:34:05
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.


[Captioner] 19:34:08
>> Ms. Gauthier: COUNCILMEMBER SHAO.


[Captioner] 19:34:11
>> Councilmember Shao: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:34:12
FOR THE PRESENTATION.


[Captioner] 19:34:17
AS A BIOLOGIST, I'M VERY INTERESTED IN


[Captioner] 19:34:23
THE TWO NEW TECHNOLOGIES, NAMELY THE


[Captioner] 19:34:26
BACTERIAL INFECTION AND THE GENETIC


[Captioner] 19:34:29
MODIFICATIONS TO ABATE THE MOSQUITOES.


[Captioner] 19:34:35
MY QUESTION ACTUALLY IS ABOUT THE 

[Captioner] 19:34:36
MONEY,


[Captioner] 19:34:37
THE FISCAL HEALTH OF THIS 

[Captioner] 19:34:37
ORGANIZATION.


[Captioner] 19:34:42
SO I UNDERSTAND THAT SO FAR, CLOSE TO


[Captioner] 19:34:45
$5 MILLION PER YEAR REVENUE IS


[Captioner] 19:34:48
SUSTAINABLE FOR YOUR ANNUAL 

[Captioner] 19:34:48
OPERATIONS.


[Captioner] 19:34:54
MY QUESTION IS, IF YOU DECIDE TO


[Captioner] 19:34:56
INTRODUCE EITHER OF THE NEW TECHNOLOG


[Captioner] 19:34:59
IES TO ALAMEDA COUNTY, WOULD THAT


[Captioner] 19:35:02
SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE YOUR OPERATION


[Captioner] 19:35:02
BUDGET?


[Captioner] 19:35:06
IF SO, IS THERE A PLAN TO INCREASE THE


[Captioner] 19:35:09
TAX FOR MOSQUITO ABATEMENTS?


[Captioner] 19:35:10
>> I DO NOT THINK SO.


[Captioner] 19:35:14
AT THIS POINT -- IN THE MEANTIME --


[Captioner] 19:35:15
WE'VE BEEN PLANNING FOR A WHILE.


[Captioner] 19:35:17
WE HAVE THE BENEFIT OF GEOGRAPHY AND


[Captioner] 19:35:17
CLIMATE.


[Captioner] 19:35:19
SO AS YOU'VE SEEN THIS MOSQUITO MARCH


[Captioner] 19:35:21
ITS WAY UP THE CENTRAL VALLEY, MARCH 

[Captioner] 19:35:21
ITS


[Captioner] 19:35:24
WAY INTO THE MORE WARMER PARTS OF


[Captioner] 19:35:25
CALIFORNIA, WE KNOW IT'S COMING SO 

[Captioner] 19:35:26
WE'VE


[Captioner] 19:35:27
BEEN -- THANKFULLY OUR BOARD HAS BEEN


[Captioner] 19:35:30
VERY PRUDENT WITH FINANCIAL AND FISCAL


[Captioner] 19:35:31
POLICIES, RESERVES.


[Captioner] 19:35:33
WE DO HAVE RESERVES SAVED UP AND WE


[Captioner] 19:35:35
ALSO -- I'VE BEEN WORKING WITH OTHER


[Captioner] 19:35:36
COUNTIES IN THE AIR THAT HAVE MUTUAL 

[Captioner] 19:35:37
AID


[Captioner] 19:35:38
AGREEMENTS, SO I'M NOT A REAL BELIEVER


[Captioner] 19:35:39
IN JUST DOING THIS ALONE.


[Captioner] 19:35:41
WE WOULD PROBABLY WORK WITH SANTA 

[Captioner] 19:35:42
CLARA


[Captioner] 19:35:44
COUNTY, MAYBE SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY, 

[Captioner] 19:35:44
CONTRA


[Captioner] 19:35:46
COSTA, AND COME UP WITH A COST SHARING


[Captioner] 19:35:46
AGREEMENT.


[Captioner] 19:35:48
SO THERE IS A WAY TO BE EFFICIENT.


[Captioner] 19:35:50
WE JUST DID A STUDY LAST YEAR WITH 

[Captioner] 19:35:50
U.C.


[Captioner] 19:35:52
BERKELEY TO WORK AT OUR CURRENT 

[Captioner] 19:35:52
WORKLOAD


[Captioner] 19:35:54
AND WE SHOULD BE FINE FOR THE NEXT


[Captioner] 19:35:54
SEVERAL YEARS.


[Captioner] 19:35:55
WE WILL BE FINE.


[Captioner] 19:35:57
LIKE CITIES OR OTHER GOVERNMENTS, WE 

[Captioner] 19:35:58
DO


[Captioner] 19:35:59
HAVE SOME COSTS, SOME LIABILITIES WITH


[Captioner] 19:36:01
PENSIONS, BUT WE'VE, AGAIN, PUT MONEY


[Captioner] 19:36:02
ASIDE FOR THAT.


[Captioner] 19:36:06
SO I HOPE -- DON'T MARK MY WORDS ON


[Captioner] 19:36:08
THIS, BUT I HOPE AT SOME POINT, I 

[Captioner] 19:36:08
COULD


[Captioner] 19:36:10
GO TO MY BOARD AND SAY MAYBE IT'S TIME


[Captioner] 19:36:12
TO REDUCE THE BENEFIT ASSESSMENT, 

[Captioner] 19:36:12
WHICH


[Captioner] 19:36:13
IS NOT VERY COMMON TO DO.


[Captioner] 19:36:17
WE ARE APPROVED FOR $5, WE ONLY 

[Captioner] 19:36:17
COLLECT


[Captioner] 19:36:19
2.50 BUT IT'S GOT A COST OF LIVING SO


[Captioner] 19:36:20
RIGHT NOW IT'S ABOUT $8.


[Captioner] 19:36:23
BUT WE STILL -- AT ONE POINT WHEN OUR


[Captioner] 19:36:25
RESERVES ARE FULL AND OUR FISCAL


[Captioner] 19:36:27
POLICIES, WE MAY EVEN LOOK TO ACTUALLY


[Captioner] 19:36:28
REDUCE THOSE IF THAT'S THE CASE.


[Captioner] 19:36:31
AND YOU KNOW, IF YOUR BILL GOES FROM


[Captioner] 19:36:33
2.50 TO 2.45, WOULD YOU NOTICE IT?


[Captioner] 19:36:34
NO, BUT IT'S STILL THE RIGHT THING TO


[Captioner] 19:36:35
DO.


[Captioner] 19:36:37
SO I DO THINK THAT WE ARE EXPECTING 

[Captioner] 19:36:37
FOR


[Captioner] 19:36:39
AN INCREASE OF STAFF, AN INCREASE OF


[Captioner] 19:36:41
TECHNOLOGY, BUT I DO THINK WORKING 

[Captioner] 19:36:41
WITH


[Captioner] 19:36:43
PARTNERING WITH AGENCIES IN DIFFERENT


[Captioner] 19:36:45
DISTRICTS AND WORKING WITH SOME


[Captioner] 19:36:46
EFFICIENCIES, I THINK WE CAN WEATHER 

[Captioner] 19:36:46
IT


[Captioner] 19:36:48
WITHOUT CHANGING OUR BENEFIT


[Captioner] 19:36:48
ASSESSMENT.


[Captioner] 19:36:49
>> Councilmember Shao: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:36:51
>> Ms. Gauthier: COUNCILMEMBER KENG.


[Captioner] 19:36:55
>> Vice Mayor Keng: I ACTUALLY DIDN'T


[Captioner] 19:36:56
HAVE A QUESTION.


[Captioner] 19:36:57
>> Ms. Gauthier: OH, I'M SORRY.


[Captioner] 19:36:58
COUNCILMEMBER COX.


[Captioner] 19:37:00
SORRY, VICE MAYOR KENG.


[Captioner] 19:37:01
COUNCILMEMBER COX IS NEXT.


[Captioner] 19:37:02
>> Councilmember Cox: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:37:06
I REALLY ENJOYED LEARNING MORE ABOUT


[Captioner] 19:37:08
MOSQUITOES, MORE THAN I EVER -- 

[Captioner] 19:37:08
PROBABLY


[Captioner] 19:37:11
IN MY ENTIRE LIFE, BUT I HAD A QUICK


[Captioner] 19:37:14
QUESTION AND I THOUGHT IT WAS KIND OF


[Captioner] 19:37:16
FASCINATING ABOUT -- I'M A NUCLEAR


[Captioner] 19:37:20
ENGINEER BY TRAINING, AND ABOUT THE


[Captioner] 19:37:23
ZAPPING OF THE MOSQUITOES, AND TRYING 

[Captioner] 19:37:23
TO


[Captioner] 19:37:26
UNDERSTAND, IS IT MORE THAN A STEP


[Captioner] 19:37:28
ABOVE -- IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S IN A


[Captioner] 19:37:31
CONTAINER, BUT IS IT A STEP ABOVE A


[Captioner] 19:37:33
MICROWAVE, AND THEY KIND OF GET A 

[Captioner] 19:37:33
LITTLE


[Captioner] 19:37:33
ROASTED A LITTLE BIT?


[Captioner] 19:37:35
I MEAN, YOU KNOW, I'M JUST TRYING TO


[Captioner] 19:37:37
UNDERSTAND THAT LITTLE PART OF IT, HOW


[Captioner] 19:37:39
THEY COME BACK OUT ALIVE, YOU KNOW?


[Captioner] 19:37:40
>> YEAH, THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.


[Captioner] 19:37:42
AND WE DO -- I KNOW THE DISTRICTS THAT


[Captioner] 19:37:46
WORK WITH THIS, THEY ACTUALLY WORK


[Captioner] 19:37:49
THROUGH THE IAEA, I DON'T KNOW WHAT 

[Captioner] 19:37:49
THE


[Captioner] 19:37:51
ACRONYM STANDS FOR, BUT THE ATOMIC


[Captioner] 19:37:52
ENERGY COMMISSION ACTUALLY LOOKS AT 

[Captioner] 19:37:52
THIS


[Captioner] 19:37:56
TO SEE WHAT THE ROTAGENS, WHAT THE


[Captioner] 19:37:58
AMOUNT OF RADIATION THAT'S USED.


[Captioner] 19:38:00
SO IT HAS TO BE ENOUGH WHERE IT 

[Captioner] 19:38:00
ACTUALLY


[Captioner] 19:38:03
STERILIZES BUT IT CAN'T BE TOO MUCH


[Captioner] 19:38:05
RADIATION WHERE IT MAKES THEM 

[Captioner] 19:38:05
UNVIABLE.


[Captioner] 19:38:07
SO IT'S THAT SWEET SPOT WHERE YOU FIND


[Captioner] 19:38:10
WHERE THEY ACTUALLY -- I MEAN, YOU'RE


[Captioner] 19:38:12
THINKING MOSQUITOES BUT -- THEY WANT 

[Captioner] 19:38:12
TO


[Captioner] 19:38:14
LOOK ATTRACTIVE TO FEMALES LIKE AN


[Captioner] 19:38:17
ATTRACTIVE MATE AS WELL STILL, SO IT'S


[Captioner] 19:38:19
THAT KIND OF MIXTURE OF THAT LOOKS 

[Captioner] 19:38:19
LIKE


[Captioner] 19:38:20
AN ATTRACTIVE MATE BUT THEY HAPPEN TO 

[Captioner] 19:38:21
BE
STERILE.


[Captioner] 19:38:23
SO THEY HAVE DIALED IT IN TO FIND THAT


[Captioner] 19:38:26
RIGHT PART TO ACTUALLY HAVE THIS


[Captioner] 19:38:26
TECHNOLOGY.


[Captioner] 19:38:29
SO IT'S PRETTY WILD THAT -- BUT IT IS


[Captioner] 19:38:30
EFFECTIVE, AGAIN.


[Captioner] 19:38:35
RIGHT OFF TAMPA AND FORT MYERS, 

[Captioner] 19:38:35
THERE'S


[Captioner] 19:38:36
SOME ISLANDS WHICH UNFORTUNATELY 

[Captioner] 19:38:36
THEY'VE


[Captioner] 19:38:37
HAD TO STOP THE EXPERIMENTS BECAUSE OF


[Captioner] 19:38:40
THE DAMAGE FROM THE HURRICANE, BUT 

[Captioner] 19:38:40
THEY


[Captioner] 19:38:42
HAVE DONE SOME WORK AND THEY'VE SHOWN


[Captioner] 19:38:43
THAT AFTER TIME OF RELEASING THESE 

[Captioner] 19:38:43
OVER


[Captioner] 19:38:45
AND OVER AGAIN, THEY'RE SEEING THE


[Captioner] 19:38:47
POPULATION GO DOWN ALMOST 90%


[Captioner] 19:38:47
SOMETIMES.


[Captioner] 19:38:48
SO IT'S VERY PROMISING.


[Captioner] 19:38:51
BUT IT REALLY WORKS WELL IN ISOLATED


[Captioner] 19:38:53
AREA, SO WHEN THERE'S NOT NEW


[Captioner] 19:38:55
INTRODUCTIONS OF NEW MOSQUITOES.


[Captioner] 19:38:57
SO IF IT'S -- LIKE IN THE MIDDLE OF


[Captioner] 19:38:59
FREMONT, IF WE DID THIS, WE MAY HAVE 

[Captioner] 19:38:59
TO


[Captioner] 19:39:02
WORRY ABOUT OTHER MOSQUITOES KIND OF


[Captioner] 19:39:03
COMPETING AGAINST THESE STERILE MALES.


[Captioner] 19:39:05
BUT I'D BE HAPPY TO TALK FURTHER 

[Captioner] 19:39:05
OFFLINE


[Captioner] 19:39:07
IF YOU'D LIKE TO HEAR MORE ABOUT HOW 

[Captioner] 19:39:07
THE


[Captioner] 19:39:11
NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY CAN HELP CONTROL


[Captioner] 19:39:12
MOSQUITO POPULATIONS.


[Captioner] 19:39:13
>> Councilmember Cox: I MIGHT HAVE TO


[Captioner] 19:39:14
TAKE YOU UP ON THAT, DEFINITELY.


[Captioner] 19:39:17
THAT SOUNDS REAL EXCITING.


[Captioner] 19:39:19
I WAS JUST CURIOUS, IN TERMS OF --


[Captioner] 19:39:21
THERE'S A LOW LEVEL, I ASSUME, OF ANY


[Captioner] 19:39:24
TYPE OF THE RADIATION, SO IF THEY DO 

[Captioner] 19:39:25
GET


[Captioner] 19:39:28
OUT AND THE FEMALE DOES HAVE A HABIT 

[Captioner] 19:39:29
OF


[Captioner] 19:39:30
BITING, THAT IT WOULDN'T BE 

[Captioner] 19:39:31
TRANSMITTING


[Captioner] 19:39:36
ANY OTHER RADIATION RELATED TO THE


[Captioner] 19:39:36
RECIPIENT?


[Captioner] 19:39:38
>> THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION, AND AGAIN,


[Captioner] 19:39:40
BEFORE THE FEMALES DON'T EVEN GET OUT,


[Captioner] 19:39:42
THEY DON'T EVEN GET BRED.


[Captioner] 19:39:43
IT'S ONLY THE MALES THAT ARE RELEASED.


[Captioner] 19:39:45
AND THE MALES CANNOT BITE.


[Captioner] 19:39:49
SO THE FEMALES, WHEN THEY'RE A LITTLE


[Captioner] 19:39:50
SMALLER -- OR THEY'RE LARGER ACTUALLY 

[Captioner] 19:39:51
IN


[Captioner] 19:39:53
PUPA FORM SO THEY FILTER THEM OUT AND


[Captioner] 19:39:55
ALL THE FEMALES DON'T MAKE IT TO THE


[Captioner] 19:39:55
STERILIZATION STEP.


[Captioner] 19:39:59
SO ALL THAT'S BEING RELEASED WITH THE


[Captioner] 19:40:01
WOBACHIA AND WITH THE X-RAY TECHNOLOGY


[Captioner] 19:40:02
AND THE OTHER TECHNOLOGY ARE ONLY


[Captioner] 19:40:03
MALES.


[Captioner] 19:40:05
BECAUSE THE MALES DON'T HAVE THE


[Captioner] 19:40:09
CAPABILITY, THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE THE 

[Captioner] 19:40:12
PRO


[Captioner] 19:40:13
BASUS OR THE POKE INVENTORY DO THE


[Captioner] 19:40:13
WORK.


[Captioner] 19:40:15
DOS THAT MAKE SENSE TO YOU?


[Captioner] 19:40:16
>> Councilmember Cox: YES,


[Captioner] 19:40:16
DEFINITELY.


[Captioner] 19:40:17
THANK YOU SO MUCH.


[Captioner] 19:40:18
>> THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:40:24
>> Mayor Mei: ARE THERE ANY PUBLIC


[Captioner] 19:40:25
SPEAKERS?  I WANTED TO MAKE SURE 

[Captioner] 19:40:25
BEFORE


[Captioner] 19:40:26
WE MOVE ON FROM THIS.


[Captioner] 19:40:27
IS THERE ANYONE --


[Captioner] 19:40:29
>> Ms. Gauthier: THERE ARE NO PUBLIC


[Captioner] 19:40:29
SPEAKERS.


[Captioner] 19:40:31
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU FOR THIS


[Captioner] 19:40:31
INFORMATIVE PRESENTATION.


[Captioner] 19:40:36
I KNOW YOUR BOARD MEMBER GEORGE YANG 

[Captioner] 19:40:36
HAS


[Captioner] 19:40:37
ALWAYS COME AND I'VE HEARD THIS IN THE


[Captioner] 19:40:40
PAST, BUT IT'S GREAT TO HEAR THE 

[Captioner] 19:40:40
LATEST


[Captioner] 19:40:40
UPDATES TOO.


[Captioner] 19:40:43
AND FOR THOSE WHO AREN'T AWARE, THERE


[Captioner] 19:40:44
STILL SOUNDS LIKE MANY IN THE PUBLIC 

[Captioner] 19:40:44
WHO


[Captioner] 19:40:45
MAY NOT KNOW ABOUT THE WONDERFUL


[Captioner] 19:40:46
SERVICES THAT YOU CAN PROVIDE.


[Captioner] 19:40:48
SO THANK YOU AGAIN FOR COMING TO SHARE


[Captioner] 19:40:50
THAT THIS EVENING.


[Captioner] 19:40:53
>> THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR, THANK YOU,


[Captioner] 19:40:54
COUNCIL, THANK YOU, STAFF.


[Captioner] 19:40:54
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:40:57
NEXT ON OUR AGENDA THIS EVENING IS


[Captioner] 19:40:59
ITEM 6B, WHICH IS THE CAPITAL


[Captioner] 19:40:59
IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM.


[Captioner] 19:41:02
AND OUR PUBLIC WORKS DIRECTOR HANS


[Captioner] 19:41:05
LARSEN AND COMMUNITY SERVICES DIRECTOR


[Captioner] 19:41:07
SUZANNE WOLF WILL BE PROVIDING A


[Captioner] 19:41:07
PRESENTATION.


[Captioner] 19:42:54



[Captioner] 19:42:55
>> Mr. Larsen: GOOD EVENING, MAYOR MEI


[Captioner] 19:42:56
AND MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL.


[Captioner] 19:42:58
THE PURPOSE OF OUR AGENDA ITEM HERE


[Captioner] 19:43:00
TONIGHT IS TO KICK OFF THE PROCESS FOR


[Captioner] 19:43:02
DEVELOPING THE UPDATED CAPITAL


[Captioner] 19:43:05
IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM, WHICH WE CALL THE


[Captioner] 19:43:07
CIP, FOR THE CITY.


[Captioner] 19:43:10
AS THE MAYOR MENTIONED, I'M JOINED 

[Captioner] 19:43:10
HERE


[Captioner] 19:43:12
WITH SUZANNE WOLF, OUR COMMUNITY


[Captioner] 19:43:14
SERVICES DIRECTOR, DAVE PERSSELIN, OUR


[Captioner] 19:43:16
FINANCE DIRECTOR, AND I'M HANS LARSEN,


[Captioner] 19:43:17
THE PUBLIC WORKS DIRECTOR.


[Captioner] 19:43:20
AND WE WILL TRY TO MAKE THIS AS


[Captioner] 19:43:21
INTERESTING AS MOSQUITOES.


[Captioner] 19:43:23
[LAUGHTER]


[Captioner] 19:43:24
THAT WAS QUITE FASCINATING.


[Captioner] 19:43:28
SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT CAPITAL


[Captioner] 19:43:31
IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM, WE'RE REFERRING 

[Captioner] 19:43:31
TO


[Captioner] 19:43:35
THE BUILDING AND IMPROVING THE CITY'S


[Captioner] 19:43:38
CAPITAL INFRASTRUCTURE, SO THAT 

[Captioner] 19:43:38
INCLUDES


[Captioner] 19:43:40
OUR PARKS, OUR STREET SYSTEM, OUR 

[Captioner] 19:43:41
CIVIC


[Captioner] 19:43:41
FACILITIES LIKE OUR BUILDINGS.


[Captioner] 19:43:44
THIS IS DISTINCT FROM OPERATING


[Captioner] 19:43:46
SERVICES, WHICH COVER STAFF OR PUBLIC


[Captioner] 19:43:48
SAFETY AND OTHER SERVICES.


[Captioner] 19:43:53
AND I THINK A KEY THING THAT WILL ALSO


[Captioner] 19:43:55
KIND OF BE A KEY THEM THAT YOU'LL HEAR


[Captioner] 19:43:57
TONIGHT, IT ALSO INCLUDES REPLACING


[Captioner] 19:43:59
THESE FACILITIES WHEN THEY COME TO THE


[Captioner] 19:44:02
END OF THEIR USEFUL LIFE, AND WE DO 

[Captioner] 19:44:02
HAVE


[Captioner] 19:44:06
MANY FACILITIES IN FREMONT THAT HAVE


[Captioner] 19:44:08
AGED AND ARE AT THAT TIME FOR


[Captioner] 19:44:09
REPLACEMENT.


[Captioner] 19:44:19
SO THE OUTLINE OF OUR PRESENTATION 

[Captioner] 19:44:19
HERE,


[Captioner] 19:44:23
WE HAVE ABOUT 32 SLIDES AND IT PLANNED


[Captioner] 19:44:23
APPROXIMATELY 30 MINUTES FOR THIS


[Captioner] 19:44:24
PRESENTATION.


[Captioner] 19:44:24
THERE'S A LOT TO COVER.


[Captioner] 19:44:28
WE WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU KIND OF THE


[Captioner] 19:44:30
OVERVIEW OF THE CIP PROCESS AND THE


[Captioner] 19:44:32
STATUS OF THE REVENUES THAT WE HAVE.


[Captioner] 19:44:37
THE CORE OF OUR CAPITAL PROGRAM


[Captioner] 19:44:38
PRIMARILY IS OUR PARKS, TRANSPORTATION


[Captioner] 19:44:39
AND CIVIC FACILITIES.


[Captioner] 19:44:41
AND FOR THOSE WHO HAVE SEEN THIS 

[Captioner] 19:44:42
BEFORE,


[Captioner] 19:44:43
THAT'S USUALLY WHAT WE TALK ABOUT.


[Captioner] 19:44:48
WE DO HAVE A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY WITH


[Captioner] 19:44:50
THIS CIP BECAUSE OF THE COUNCIL'S


[Captioner] 19:44:54
COMMITMENT AND RECOGNITION TO LARGE


[Captioner] 19:44:57
BACKLOGS OF NEEDS THAT WE HAVE, THE 

[Captioner] 19:44:57
CITY


[Captioner] 19:45:01
COUNCIL HAS APPROVED FUNDING FROM THE


[Captioner] 19:45:03
GENERAL FUND TO GO TOWARDS THE CIP, 

[Captioner] 19:45:03
AND


[Captioner] 19:45:07
SO WE'LL TALK ABOUT HOW THOSE CAN BE


[Captioner] 19:45:08
 USED.


[Captioner] 19:45:12
BUT WE WANTED TO REMIND COUNCIL, THIS


[Captioner] 19:45:14
COMES IN THE CONTEXT OF A VERY LARGE


[Captioner] 19:45:16
NEED OF FUNDED CAPITAL NEEDS THAT'S 

[Captioner] 19:45:16
BEEN


[Captioner] 19:45:17
ESTIMATED ABOUT A BILLION DOLLARS.


[Captioner] 19:45:19
SO WE HAVE SOME MONEY TO PUT TOWARDS


[Captioner] 19:45:19
IT.


[Captioner] 19:45:22
WE'VE GOT A REALLY SORT OF LARGE SET 

[Captioner] 19:45:22
OF


[Captioner] 19:45:26
NEEDS AND WE'LL TALK ABOUT STAFF'S 

[Captioner] 19:45:26
KIND


[Captioner] 19:45:28
OF ADVICE OR THOUGHTS IN TERMS OF, YOU


[Captioner] 19:45:31
KNOW, HOW WE WOULD SORT OF GUIDE THE


[Captioner] 19:45:32
PROCESS, BUT THEN IMPORTANTLY, WE WANT


[Captioner] 19:45:38
TO HEAR FROM YOU, ANY QUESTIONS YOU 

[Captioner] 19:45:38
HAVE


[Captioner] 19:45:40
ON THE PROCESS, ANY INPUT YOU HAVE.


[Captioner] 19:45:42
THIS IS NOT -- NO ACTION, NO 

[Captioner] 19:45:42
DIRECTION,


[Captioner] 19:45:43
BUT WE WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU


[Captioner] 19:45:45
INDIVIDUALLY, WHAT DO YOU HEAR FROM 

[Captioner] 19:45:45
YOUR


[Captioner] 19:45:47
CONSTITUENTS, WHAT DO YOU FEEL IS


[Captioner] 19:45:51
IMPORTANT FOR US TO LOOK AT IN SORT OF


[Captioner] 19:45:52
CONTEXT OF WHAT WE'LL SHARE WITH YOU,


[Captioner] 19:45:54
AND THEN WE ALSO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY 

[Captioner] 19:45:55
FOR


[Captioner] 19:45:56
COMMUNITY INPUT ON THIS TOPIC.


[Captioner] 19:46:04
SO OUR CIP, WHEN WE'RE BUILDING


[Captioner] 19:46:05
FACILITIES, YOU USUALLY HAVE TO PLAN


[Captioner] 19:46:09
TIME TO DESIGN AND PLAN AND CONSTRUCT


[Captioner] 19:46:11
THESE, SO A LOT OF THESE INVESTMENTS


[Captioner] 19:46:13
TAKE SOME TIME SO WE LOOK AT OUR 

[Captioner] 19:46:13
CAPITAL


[Captioner] 19:46:16
IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM ON A FIVE-YEAR


[Captioner] 19:46:18
HORIZON, AND THEN THE CITY COUNCIL


[Captioner] 19:46:22
ACTUALLY BUDGETS THE FIRST TWO YEARS 

[Captioner] 19:46:22
OF
THE PROCESS.


[Captioner] 19:46:24
AND WE DO AN UPDATED CIP EVERY TWO


[Captioner] 19:46:24
YEARS.


[Captioner] 19:46:28
SO THE PROCESS THAT WE HAVE IS, THIS 

[Captioner] 19:46:28
IS


[Captioner] 19:46:31
OUR KICKOFF, THE BEGINNING OF IT HERE


[Captioner] 19:46:31
TONIGHT.


[Captioner] 19:46:37
WE WILL PRESENT A DRAFT CIP TO THE


[Captioner] 19:46:40
COUNCIL IN MAY, AND THEN RECEIVE INPUT


[Captioner] 19:46:43
ON THAT, AND THEN WE'LL PREPARE A 

[Captioner] 19:46:43
FINAL


[Captioner] 19:46:46
CIP, WHICH WILL GO THROUGH A PUBLIC


[Captioner] 19:46:49
HEARING AND APPROVAL PROCESS IN JUNE.


[Captioner] 19:46:51
ALL RIGHT.


[Captioner] 19:46:57
SO IN TERMS OF REVENUE, THIS IS A 

[Captioner] 19:46:57
CHART


[Captioner] 19:46:59
INDICATING WHAT OUR CIP REVENUE HAS 

[Captioner] 19:46:59
BEEN


[Captioner] 19:47:02
IN SORT OF FIVE-YEAR INCREMENTS GOING


[Captioner] 19:47:04
BACK THE LAST FIVE CYCLES, AND SO YOU


[Captioner] 19:47:07
CAN SEE WE HAD SOME GROWTH.


[Captioner] 19:47:10
LAST CIP, WE'VE HAD A FALLOFF IN


[Captioner] 19:47:12
REVENUE, SO WE WERE KIND OF HITTING 

[Captioner] 19:47:12
THE


[Captioner] 19:47:14
BEGINNING OF THE COVID PERIOD.


[Captioner] 19:47:19
THIS NEW CIP IS ACTUALLY SORT OF THE


[Captioner] 19:47:21
HIGHEST IT BEEN FOR SOME TIME, AND I


[Captioner] 19:47:25
MIGHT NOTE PRIMARILY THE INCREMENT OF


[Captioner] 19:47:29
INCREASE IS ALMOST SOLE LEGAL RELATED 

[Captioner] 19:47:29
TO


[Captioner] 19:47:31
THE AMOUNT OF GENERAL FUND REVENUE


[Captioner] 19:47:32
THAT'S BEEN ADDED TO THIS PROCESS.


[Captioner] 19:47:36
SO WITHOUT THE GENERAL -- COMMITMENT 

[Captioner] 19:47:36
OF


[Captioner] 19:47:38
GENERAL FUND FUNDING, WE WOULD BE


[Captioner] 19:47:40
LOOKING AT A CIP THAT WAS MAYBE VERY


[Captioner] 19:47:42
SIMILAR TO THE ONE THAT WE HAD


[Captioner] 19:47:44
PREVIOUSLY.


[Captioner] 19:47:46
SO THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT'S BEEN


[Captioner] 19:47:49
ALLOCATED FOR THE CIP PURPOSES FROM 

[Captioner] 19:47:49
THE


[Captioner] 19:47:51
GENERAL FUND IS $58 MILLION.


[Captioner] 19:47:55
SO YOU CAN SEE THAT'S A PRETTY HEALTHY


[Captioner] 19:47:58
CHUNK AND HAS CREATED MORE MONEY


[Captioner] 19:48:00
AVAILABLE THAN WHAT WE WOULD HAVE


[Captioner] 19:48:00
OTHERWISE HAD.


[Captioner] 19:48:07
SO IT IS A LITTLE BIT OF A ROLLER


[Captioner] 19:48:10
COASTER IN TERMS OF CERTAIN REVENUE


[Captioner] 19:48:13
PROGRAMS ARE UP, SOME OF THEM ARE 

[Captioner] 19:48:13
DOWN,


[Captioner] 19:48:14
AND WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT THAT.


[Captioner] 19:48:18
FIRST OFF IS PRIVATE DEVELOPMENT


[Captioner] 19:48:20
REVENUES HAVE DECLINED, AND THIS IS A


[Captioner] 19:48:24
FUNCTION OF THE ECONOMY AND MARKET, 

[Captioner] 19:48:24
THE


[Captioner] 19:48:26
COST OF LENDING FOR NEW DEVELOPMENT, 

[Captioner] 19:48:26
THE


[Captioner] 19:48:29
COST OF CONSTRUCTION IS HIGHER, AND


[Captioner] 19:48:32
WE'VE SEEN A SIGNIFICANT DOWNTURN IN


[Captioner] 19:48:35
DEVELOPMENT AND AS A RESULT, REVENUES


[Captioner] 19:48:36
FROM THAT SOURCE HAVE DECLINED.


[Captioner] 19:48:40
WE HAVE ALSO SEEN AND ARE EXPERIENCING


[Captioner] 19:48:44
NOW A DECREASE IN OPPORTUNITY TO GET


[Captioner] 19:48:47
GRANT MONEYS, PARTICULARLY FROM THE


[Captioner] 19:48:49
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, PRIMARILY DUE TO


[Captioner] 19:48:52
POLICIES THAT ARE ORIENTED ON GIVING


[Captioner] 19:48:56
PRIORITY TO INVESTMENT IN HISTORICALLY


[Captioner] 19:48:57
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES, OF WHICH


[Captioner] 19:49:00
FREMONT HAS NONE THAT HAVE THAT


[Captioner] 19:49:00
DESIGNATION.


[Captioner] 19:49:03
AND THEN STATE POLICIES AND REGIONAL


[Captioner] 19:49:08
POLICIES HAVE ALSO USED THAT AS A


[Captioner] 19:49:09
PRIORITY FOCUS, SO WE'RE FINDING THAT


[Captioner] 19:49:12
OUR ABILITY TO GET OUTSIDE REVENUES IN


[Captioner] 19:49:14
THESE TIMES ARE LESS THAN WHAT THEY 

[Captioner] 19:49:14
HAVE


[Captioner] 19:49:15
BEEN IN THE PAST.


[Captioner] 19:49:19
GAS TAX REVENUES ARE UP PRIMARILY


[Captioner] 19:49:21
BECAUSE THEY'RE ASSOCIATED WITH THE


[Captioner] 19:49:25
PRICE OF GAS, AND AS THE ECONOMY HAS


[Captioner] 19:49:26
IMPROVED, MORE PEOPLE ARE DRIVING,


[Captioner] 19:49:28
TAKING TRANSIT LESS, SO WE'RE SEEING A


[Captioner] 19:49:29
LITTLE BIT OF IMPROVEMENT THERE.


[Captioner] 19:49:33
AND THEN AS WE POINTED OUT, THE 

[Captioner] 19:49:33
GENERAL


[Captioner] 19:49:36
FUND TRANSFERS TO THE CIP HAVE 

[Captioner] 19:49:36
INCREASED


[Captioner] 19:49:38
BASED ON COUNCIL'S PAST ACTIONS.


[Captioner] 19:49:40
BUT ALL OF THIS IS KIND OF QUALIFIED 

[Captioner] 19:49:41
BY


[Captioner] 19:49:42
THE FACT THINGS ARE COSTING MORE TOO,


[Captioner] 19:49:45
AND SO THE MONEY THAT WE HAVE, WE'RE


[Captioner] 19:49:48
ABLE TO DO LESS WITH BECAUSE OF


[Captioner] 19:49:50
ESCALATION AND INFLATION, AND COUNCIL


[Captioner] 19:49:52
HAS HEARD THAT FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS,


[Captioner] 19:49:56
WE'VE SEEN ABOUT A 20% INCREASE IN THE


[Captioner] 19:49:58
COST OF CONSTRUCTION FOR CAPITAL


[Captioner] 19:49:58
PROJECTS.


[Captioner] 19:50:05
THIS SLIDE HERE INDICATES, SO OF THE


[Captioner] 19:50:12
PROJECTED AMOUNT FOR THE FIVE-YEAR CIP


[Captioner] 19:50:14
CYCLE OF $249 MILLION, A LOT OF THE


[Captioner] 19:50:16
MONEY THAT WE HAVE, OVER 60% IS


[Captioner] 19:50:18
RESTRICTED AND DEDICATED TO CERTAIN
PROGRAMS.


[Captioner] 19:50:22
SO MONEY THAT WE GET IN TRANSPORTATION


[Captioner] 19:50:26
FROM THE STATE GAS TAX, COUNTY MEASURE


[Captioner] 19:50:28
BB, CERTAIN DEVELOPMENT FEES, YOU 

[Captioner] 19:50:28
KNOW,


[Captioner] 19:50:30
ARE TARGETED TOWARDS TRANSPORTATION 

[Captioner] 19:50:30
AND


[Captioner] 19:50:32
CAN ONLY BE USED FOR THOSE PURPOSES, 

[Captioner] 19:50:32
AND


[Captioner] 19:50:35
YOU CAN SEE THE TYPES OF THINGS THAT 

[Captioner] 19:50:35
WE


[Captioner] 19:50:35
FUND WITH THAT.


[Captioner] 19:50:38
PAVEMENT MAINTENANCE, SAFETY


[Captioner] 19:50:39
IMPROVEMENT, BIKE PED INFRASTRUCTURE 

[Captioner] 19:50:39
AND


[Captioner] 19:50:40
OTHER PROJECTS.


[Captioner] 19:50:44
SAME THING ON THE PARKSIDE, DEDICATED


[Captioner] 19:50:46
MONEY FROM DEVELOPMENT FEES AND GRANTS


[Captioner] 19:50:50
THAT GOES TO NEW PARK ACQUISITION AND


[Captioner] 19:50:50
CONSTRUCTION.


[Captioner] 19:50:53
AND THEN WE ALSO HAVE SOME PROGRAMS 

[Captioner] 19:50:54
THAT


[Captioner] 19:50:54
SUPPORT OUR CIVIC FACILITIES.


[Captioner] 19:50:59
THE GENERAL FUND HISTORICALLY HAS BEEN


[Captioner] 19:51:03
ALLOCATING SOME MONEY TO CERTAIN


[Captioner] 19:51:06
SPECIFIC INVESTMENT TYPES WITHIN THE 

[Captioner] 19:51:06
--


[Captioner] 19:51:07
IN THE CIP.


[Captioner] 19:51:09
SO THE NEXT SLIDE WILL KIND OF SHOW 

[Captioner] 19:51:09
WHAT


[Captioner] 19:51:11
THAT IS, BUT THERE'S MONEY FOR 

[Captioner] 19:51:12
SIDEWALK


[Captioner] 19:51:16
REPAIR, PAVEMENT MAINTENANCE, MEDIAN,


[Captioner] 19:51:19
LANDSCAPING REPLACEMENT, 50/50 TREE


[Captioner] 19:51:21
PROGRAM, ADA IMPROVEMENTS AND BUILDING


[Captioner] 19:51:21
MAINTENANCE.


[Captioner] 19:51:23
SO YOU'LL SEE THAT IN A MINUTE.


[Captioner] 19:51:26
THE BOTTOM BAND HERE IS THE NEW FUNDS


[Captioner] 19:51:28
FROM THE GENERAL FUND.


[Captioner] 19:51:32
THESE ARE NOT ALLOCATED YET FOR ANY


[Captioner] 19:51:33
PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND SO THAT'S PART


[Captioner] 19:51:35
OF WHAT WE'RE DISCUSSING TONIGHT AND 

[Captioner] 19:51:35
IN


[Captioner] 19:51:36
THE CIP PROCESS.


[Captioner] 19:51:40
THIS COULD BE ALLOCATED TO A VARIETY 

[Captioner] 19:51:40
OF


[Captioner] 19:51:42
DIFFERENT SOURCES AND WE'LL PROVIDE 

[Captioner] 19:51:43
YOU


[Captioner] 19:51:45
WITH OUR SUGGESTIONS ON WHERE WE THINK


[Captioner] 19:51:49
THOSE FUNDS ARE MOST IMPORTANT TO 50 

[Captioner] 19:51:49
TO


[Captioner] 19:51:50
FROM THE STAFF'S PERSPECTIVE.


[Captioner] 19:51:56
SO THIS IS A SLIDE THAT INDICATES THE


[Captioner] 19:51:59
ALLOCATION OF GENERAL FUND MONEYS, AND


[Captioner] 19:52:03
SO BASED ON PAST ACTIONS, THIS HAS 

[Captioner] 19:52:03
BEEN


[Captioner] 19:52:07
A ANNUAL TRANSFER TO THE CIP THAT'S 

[Captioner] 19:52:07
NOW


[Captioner] 19:52:10
$7 MILLION A YEAR FOR THE PURPOSES


[Captioner] 19:52:10
INDICATED.


[Captioner] 19:52:14
I MIGHT NOTE A COUPLE YEARS AGO, THIS


[Captioner] 19:52:15
ALLOCATION WAS $5 MILLION A YEAR, SO 

[Captioner] 19:52:16
THE


[Captioner] 19:52:18
CITY COUNCIL HAS INCREASED INVESTMENTS


[Captioner] 19:52:21
TO THESE ANNUAL TRANSFERS TO SUPPORT


[Captioner] 19:52:22
THESE VARIOUS PROGRAMS.


[Captioner] 19:52:25
ALL RIGHT.


[Captioner] 19:52:28
SO WE'RE GOING TO GO INTO THE NEXT 

[Captioner] 19:52:28
PART,


[Captioner] 19:52:30
WHICH IS A REVIEW OF OUR CORE CIP


[Captioner] 19:52:30
PROGRAMS.


[Captioner] 19:52:34
AND I'M GOING TO TURN IT OVER TO 

[Captioner] 19:52:35
SUZANNE


[Captioner] 19:52:36
TO SHARE WITH YOU WHAT'S GOING ON IN 

[Captioner] 19:52:36
THE


[Captioner] 19:52:36
PARKS PROGRAM.


[Captioner] 19:52:39
>> Ms. Wolf: THANK YOU, HANS.


[Captioner] 19:52:39
GOOD EVENING.


[Captioner] 19:52:42
I'M SUZANNE WOLF, COMMUNITY SERVICES


[Captioner] 19:52:42
DIRECTOR.


[Captioner] 19:52:44
AND THIS IS THE PARKS PORTION OF THE


[Captioner] 19:52:44
CIP.


[Captioner] 19:52:51
AS THIS PICTURE SHOWS, WE HAVE SOME


[Captioner] 19:52:53
WONDERFUL ACCOMPLISHMENTS THAT WE CAN 

[Captioner] 19:52:53
BE


[Captioner] 19:52:56
PROUD OF, INCLUDING OUR JULY 2022


[Captioner] 19:52:58
RE-OPENING OF THE CALIFORNIA NURSERY,


[Captioner] 19:53:00
HISTORICAL PARK WITH NEW PATHWAYS AND


[Captioner] 19:53:00
INFRASTRUCTURE.


[Captioner] 19:53:05
ONE OF OUR MAIN ACCOMPLISHMENTS WAS 

[Captioner] 19:53:06
THE


[Captioner] 19:53:07
APPROVAL OF THE PARKS AND RECREATION


[Captioner] 19:53:09
MASTER PLAN THAT SET THE PRIORITIES 

[Captioner] 19:53:09
FOR


[Captioner] 19:53:12
THE NEXT 15 TO 20 YEARS BASED ON THE


[Captioner] 19:53:12
COMMUNITY IDENTIFIED NEEDS.


[Captioner] 19:53:16
WE ARE ALSO EXCITED ABOUT THE OPENING 

[Captioner] 19:53:17
OF


[Captioner] 19:53:17
DUSTERBERRY PARK THIS SPRING.


[Captioner] 19:53:20
IF WE GET A BREAK IN THE WEATHER, THEN


[Captioner] 19:53:21
OUR CONSTRUCTION CREW WILL BE ABLE TO


[Captioner] 19:53:23
FINISH THE PARK FOR OUR RESIDENTS AND


[Captioner] 19:53:25
WE'RE STILL HOPING FOR A MAY OPENING


[Captioner] 19:53:26
DATE.


[Captioner] 19:53:31
CURRENTLY UNDERWAY FROM OUR LAST CIP


[Captioner] 19:53:34

NURSERY PRESIDENT'S HOUSE, UPGRADES 

[Captioner] 19:53:36

[Captioner] 19:53:38
RENOVATIONS FROM A STATE GRANT THAT WE


[Captioner] 19:53:40
RECEIVED IN 2021 TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL


[Captioner] 19:53:42
PROGRAM SPACE FOR COMMUNITY AND 

[Captioner] 19:53:42
CULTURAL
EVENTS.


[Captioner] 19:53:45
WE HAVE OTHER PROJECTS UNDERWAY AS

[Captioner] 19:53:54
MARSHALL PARK


[Captioner] 19:53:55

[Captioner] 19:53:58
FINALLY, WE'RE APPLYING FOR A 

[Captioner] 19:53:58
TEMPORARY


[Captioner] 19:54:00
PICKLE BALL COURT TO BE IN PLACE 

[Captioner] 19:54:00
BEFORE


[Captioner] 19:54:00
THE END OF 2023.

AS WE BEGAN PREPARING FOR THE 

[Captioner] 19:54:04
PERMANENT


[Captioner] 19:54:05
COURT, WHICH WE'LL TALK ABOUT IN JUST 

[Captioner] 19:54:05
A
MINUTE.


[Captioner] 19:54:10
BEFORE YOU THIS EVENING IS OUR 

[Captioner] 19:54:10
PROPOSED


[Captioner] 19:54:12
FIVE-YEAR PARK CIP CYCLE.


[Captioner] 19:54:15
TONIGHT WE ARE FOLLOWING UP ON OUR


[Captioner] 19:54:17
MASTER PLAN PRIORITIES PROVIDED BY THE


[Captioner] 19:54:19
COMMUNITY AND ADOPTED BY THE CITY


[Captioner] 19:54:19
COUNCIL LAST YEAR.


[Captioner] 19:54:22
THE RECREATION COMMISSION HAS HELD 

[Captioner] 19:54:22
THREE


[Captioner] 19:54:24
COMMUNITY MEETINGS SO FAR TO DISCUSS 

[Captioner] 19:54:25
THE


[Captioner] 19:54:28
CIP, AND HAS UNANIMOUSLY SUPPORTED THE


[Captioner] 19:54:28
PROPOSED PARKS PLAN.


[Captioner] 19:54:31
AS YOU WILL HEAR TONIGHT, RESTROOMS 

[Captioner] 19:54:31
AND


[Captioner] 19:54:33
COMMUNITY CENTER RENOVATIONS ARE THE 

[Captioner] 19:54:33
TOP


[Captioner] 19:54:33
OF THE LIST.


[Captioner] 19:54:35
ALONG WITH SIGNIFICANT GAPS THAT WE 

[Captioner] 19:54:36
HAVE


[Captioner] 19:54:39
IN TRAILS, DOG PARKS AND PICKLEBALL


[Captioner] 19:54:39
COURTS.


[Captioner] 19:54:42
TO ACHIEVE THESE GOALS, WE ARE 

[Captioner] 19:54:42
PROPOSING


[Captioner] 19:54:44
DOG PARKS AT THE NEW PATTERSON RANCH


[Captioner] 19:54:47
NEAR ARDENWOOD REGIONAL PRESERVE, AND


[Captioner] 19:54:48
VALLEJO MILLIONTHS.


[Captioner] 19:54:49
 VALLE MILLS.


[Captioner] 19:54:51
 VALLEJO MILLS.


[Captioner] 19:54:56
WE ARE ALSO CONTINUING OUR EFFORTS TO


[Captioner] 19:55:00
PURSUE NEW PARKLAND ACQUISITIONINGS 

[Captioner] 19:55:00
FOR


[Captioner] 19:55:01
AREAS THAT DO NOT HAVE A 10-MINUTE 

[Captioner] 19:55:01
WALK


[Captioner] 19:55:03
AND THIS WILL COME BEFORE COUNCIL


[Captioner] 19:55:03
SEPARATELY.


[Captioner] 19:55:05
TRAILS CONTINUE TO BE A TOP PRIORITY 

[Captioner] 19:55:05
IN


[Captioner] 19:55:05
OUR COMMUNITY.


[Captioner] 19:55:06
AND OUR EFFORTS CONTINUE.


[Captioner] 19:55:10
WITH THE HETCH HETCHY CORRIDOR AND


[Captioner] 19:55:11

[Captioner] 19:55:13
PERMANENT PICKLEBALL COURTS ARE 

[Captioner] 19:55:14
PROPOSED


[Captioner] 19:55:15
FOR VALLEJO MILLS AND PACIFIC COMMONS.


[Captioner] 19:55:18
OUR COMMUNITY ALSO REITERATED THE


[Captioner] 19:55:19
IMPORTANCE OF NEIGHBORHOOD AND 

[Captioner] 19:55:20
COMMUNITY


[Captioner] 19:55:22
PARKS, AND WITH THIS PLAN, WE LOOK


[Captioner] 19:55:25
FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE COMMUNITY 

[Captioner] 19:55:25
ON


[Captioner] 19:55:26
THE CENTERVILLE COMMUNITY PARK


[Captioner] 19:55:26
UPGRADES.


[Captioner] 19:55:29
FINALLY, WE'RE PROPOSING TO ALLOCATE


[Captioner] 19:55:32

[Captioner] 19:55:34
OUTDOOR SITE IMPROVEMENT FOR THE NEW


[Captioner] 19:55:37
CENTRAL PARK MULTISERVICE COMMUNITY


[Captioner] 19:55:38
CENTER, AS PARK FUNDS CANNOT BE USED 

[Captioner] 19:55:39
FOR
BUILDINGS.


[Captioner] 19:55:45
THE URBAN FOREST MANAGEMENT PLAN WAS


[Captioner] 19:55:47
RECENTLY HEARD BY THE RECREATION


[Captioner] 19:55:48
COMMISSION AND WILL BE CONSIDERED BY 

[Captioner] 19:55:48
THE


[Captioner] 19:55:48

[Captioner] 19:55:51
THIS ALONG WITH OUR MASTER PLAN, 

[Captioner] 19:55:51
TRAILS


[Captioner] 19:55:53
AND LAND ACQUISITION STRATEGIES WILL


[Captioner] 19:55:57
HELP US CREATE A SUCCESSFUL FUTURE IN


[Captioner] 19:55:59
LOOKING AT ALL OF OUR PARK NEEDS WITH


[Captioner] 19:55:59
THE COMMUNITY.


[Captioner] 19:56:03
NOW I'LL TURN IT BACK TO HANS WHO WILL


[Captioner] 19:56:04
SPEAK ABOUT TRANSPORTATION AND CIVIC


[Captioner] 19:56:04
FACILITIES.


[Captioner] 19:56:04
HANS?


[Captioner] 19:56:07
>> Mr. Larsen: THANK YOU, SUZANNE.


[Captioner] 19:56:13
SO IN THE LAST CIP CYCLE, ONE OF OUR 

[Captioner] 19:56:14
BIG


[Captioner] 19:56:16
ACCOMPLISHMENTS WAS COMPLETING THE 

[Captioner] 19:56:16
WEST


[Captioner] 19:56:19
ACCESS BRIDGE IN THE WARM SPRINGS


[Captioner] 19:56:19
INNOVATION DISTRICT.


[Captioner] 19:56:22
THIS WAS THE OPENING THAT OCCURRED 

[Captioner] 19:56:22
LAST
YEAR.


[Captioner] 19:56:27
OTHER ACCOMPLISHMENTS IN THE PROGRAM


[Captioner] 19:56:31
INCLUDE CONTINUING TO MAINTAIN OUR 

[Captioner] 19:56:31
CITY


[Captioner] 19:56:32
STREET SYSTEM.


[Captioner] 19:56:34
A BIG ACCOMPLISHMENT THAT WILL BE


[Captioner] 19:56:36
FINISHED THIS YEAR IS THE FIRST PHASE 

[Captioner] 19:56:36
OF


[Captioner] 19:56:39
THE TRAFFIC SIGNAL MODERNIZATION 

[Captioner] 19:56:39
PROGRAM


[Captioner] 19:56:42
ON NEARLY ALL OF FREMONT BOULEVARD, SO


[Captioner] 19:56:44
THE CONSTRUCTION IS NEAR COMPLETE AND


[Captioner] 19:56:47
WE'LL BE ABLE TO SEE THE BENEFITS OF


[Captioner] 19:56:49
THAT LATER THIS YEAR.


[Captioner] 19:56:51
AND THEN WE'VE ALSO BEEN ABLE TO 

[Captioner] 19:56:51
ADVANCE


[Captioner] 19:56:55
A NUMBER OF BIG MAJOR PROJECTS AND


[Captioner] 19:56:56
WHAT'S ILLUSTRATED HERE IS AN EXAMPLE 

[Captioner] 19:56:56
OF


[Captioner] 19:57:00
THE SABERCAT BRIDGE, WHICH CITY


[Captioner] 19:57:02
COUNCIL'S RECENTLY APPROVED, AND OVER


[Captioner] 19:57:04
THE LAST TWO YEARS, WE'VE RECEIVED 

[Captioner] 19:57:05
THREE


[Captioner] 19:57:07
DIFFERENT GRANTS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT 

[Captioner] 19:57:07
OF


[Captioner] 19:57:09
THAT PROJECT TOTALING ALMOST


[Captioner] 19:57:09
$18 MILLION.


[Captioner] 19:57:15
SOME OTHER MAJOR PROJECTS THAT ARE IN


[Captioner] 19:57:17
THE PLANNING AND DESIGN PROCESS 

[Captioner] 19:57:18
INCLUDE


[Captioner] 19:57:21
THE UPGRADE TO THE 262 CROSS-CONNECTOR


[Captioner] 19:57:23
MISSION BOULEVARD, WHICH IS BEING LED 

[Captioner] 19:57:24
BY


[Captioner] 19:57:24
ALAMEDA COUNTY TRANSPORTATION


[Captioner] 19:57:24
COMMISSION.


[Captioner] 19:57:28
THERE WILL BE PUBLIC MEETINGS ON THE


[Captioner] 19:57:30
ENVIRONMENTAL CLEARANCE FOR THIS 

[Captioner] 19:57:30
PROJECT


[Captioner] 19:57:32
COMING UP LATER THIS SPRING.


[Captioner] 19:57:35
WE'RE CONTINUING TO WORK WITH BART ON


[Captioner] 19:57:36
THE IRVINGTON BART STATION.


[Captioner] 19:57:39
WE HAVE SEVERAL FREEWAY INTERCHANGE


[Captioner] 19:57:42
MODERNIZATIONS, MANY TRAIL CORRIDORS,


[Captioner] 19:57:45
INCLUDING TRAIL BRIDGES OVER FREEWAYS


[Captioner] 19:57:49
LIKE SABERCAT, AND THE 880 INNOVATION


[Captioner] 19:57:51
BRIDGE, WHICH IS SHOWN IN THE LOWER


[Captioner] 19:57:51
RIGHT.


[Captioner] 19:57:53
AND THEN WE HAVE OARL CORRIDORS WHERE


[Captioner] 19:57:58
WE'RE MAKING INVESTMENTS TOWARDS SAFE


[Captioner] 19:58:01
AND COMPLETE STREET IMPROVEMENTS ON


[Captioner] 19:58:03
FREMONT BOULEVARD IN CENTERVILLE AND


[Captioner] 19:58:06
ALSO A PROJECT IN DECOTO, AND WE'RE


[Captioner] 19:58:08
CONTINUING TO DO WORK TO EXPAND THE


[Captioner] 19:58:10
NUMBER OF RAILROAD QUIET ZONES WE 

[Captioner] 19:58:10
HAVE.


[Captioner] 19:58:13
SO THAT'S SOME OF THE MAJOR WORK IN


[Captioner] 19:58:14
PROGRESS.


[Captioner] 19:58:18
AS WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE NEXT SORT OF


[Captioner] 19:58:21
TWO-YEAR BUDGET AND FIVE-YEAR CIP,


[Captioner] 19:58:23
THINGS THAT WE'RE FOCUSING ON ARE


[Captioner] 19:58:28
CONTINUING TO REPAIR SIDEWALKS AND


[Captioner] 19:58:29
PROVIDE ADA RAMPS.


[Captioner] 19:58:33
AS MANY OF YOU ON COUNCIL ARE AWARE, I


[Captioner] 19:58:34
THINK IT WAS ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO, 

[Captioner] 19:58:34
THERE


[Captioner] 19:58:37
WAS A COMMITMENT TO FIX -- WORK 

[Captioner] 19:58:37
TOWARDS


[Captioner] 19:58:39
FIXING THE WORST SIDEWALKS THAT WE 

[Captioner] 19:58:39
HAVE


[Captioner] 19:58:39
IN FREMONT.


[Captioner] 19:58:42
AND SO I'M PLEASED TO REPORT THAT WE


[Captioner] 19:58:45
SHOULD BE COMPLETED WITH THAT IN THIS


[Captioner] 19:58:48
NEXT TWO-YEAR CYCLE, SO THIS IS A


[Captioner] 19:58:50
PICTURE HERE OF WHAT A REALLY BAD


[Captioner] 19:58:50
SIDEWALK LOOKS LIKE.


[Captioner] 19:58:53
WE WILL PATCH IT SO THAT IT'S NOT A


[Captioner] 19:58:58
TRIPPING HAZARD, BUT THE REPAIR IS TO


[Captioner] 19:59:02
REMOVE IT, REPLACE IT, DEAL WITH THE


[Captioner] 19:59:04
ADJOINING TREE AS PART OF THAT


[Captioner] 19:59:04
IMPROVEMENT.


[Captioner] 19:59:07
SO WE'RE ALMOST KIND OF RUNNING THE


[Captioner] 19:59:10
COURSE OF SEVERELY IMPACTED SIDEWALKS,


[Captioner] 19:59:14
BUT WE DO HAVE OTHERS THAT ARE MORE


[Captioner] 19:59:16
MODERATELY AND MINOR -- WITH MINOR


[Captioner] 19:59:20
DAMAGE WHICH WE CONTINUE TO LOOK TO


[Captioner] 19:59:21
PROPERTY OWNERS TO FIX THAT.


[Captioner] 19:59:25
WE'LL CONTINUE TO DO WORK ON PAVEMENT


[Captioner] 19:59:27
MAINTENANCE, EXPAND OUR TRAFFIC SIGNAL


[Captioner] 19:59:28
MODERNIZATION PROGRAM.


[Captioner] 19:59:30
IN TERMS OF SAFE AND COMPLETE STREETS,


[Captioner] 19:59:33
WE'VE DONE A LOT OF THAT WORK,


[Captioner] 19:59:34
PARTICULARLY OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS.


[Captioner] 19:59:40
PROJECTS THAT WE HAVE COMING UP ARE


[Captioner] 19:59:44
IMPROVEMENTS ON PASEO PADRE, PARKWAY


[Captioner] 19:59:46
CORRIDOR, BASED ON ACTIONS TAKEN BY 

[Captioner] 19:59:47
CITY


[Captioner] 19:59:49
COUNCIL, AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO GO 

[Captioner] 19:59:49
OUT


[Captioner] 19:59:52
TO THE COMMUNITY AND DO AN UPDATED


[Captioner] 19:59:56
ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION PLAN TO GET 

[Captioner] 19:59:56
INPUT


[Captioner] 19:59:58
FROM THE COMMUNITY AND IDENTIFY WHERE 

[Captioner] 19:59:58
WE


[Captioner] 20:00:00
WANT TO MAKE INVESTMENTS TO IMPROVE


[Captioner] 20:00:03
WALKING AND BIKING AND SAFETY IN 

[Captioner] 20:00:03
FREMONT


[Captioner] 20:00:05
AS PART OF A NEW FIVE-YEAR PLAN.


[Captioner] 20:00:07
SO THAT WILL BE A BIG ACTIVITY THIS


[Captioner] 20:00:07
COMING YEAR.


[Captioner] 20:00:11
AND THEN WE'LL CONTINUE TO WORK OP


[Captioner] 20:00:13
DEVELOPING THE MAJOR PROJECTS, WHICH


[Captioner] 20:00:14
WERE ON THE PREVIOUS SLIDE.


[Captioner] 20:00:18
SO I'M GOING TO TRANSITION NOW TO KIND


[Captioner] 20:00:21
OF OUR THIRD MAJOR CATEGORY, CIVIC


[Captioner] 20:00:21
FACILITIES AND BUILDINGS.


[Captioner] 20:00:26
AND SO BIG ACCOMPLISHMENT WAS OPENING


[Captioner] 20:00:27
THE DOWNTOWN EVENT CENTER AND PLAZA.


[Captioner] 20:00:30
LAST YEAR.


[Captioner] 20:00:33
A BEAUTIFUL FACILITY THAT REALLY BEING


[Captioner] 20:00:34
EMBRACED BY THE COMMUNITY.


[Captioner] 20:00:39
WE'VE HAD A NUMBER OF OTHER PROJECTS


[Captioner] 20:00:39
TOO.


[Captioner] 20:00:42
THE AGEWELL CENTER OPENED LAST YEAR.


[Captioner] 20:00:47
AND THEN MORE OF JUST KIND OF BASIC 

[Captioner] 20:00:47
WORK


[Captioner] 20:00:49
TO KEEP OUR BUILDINGS FUNCTIONING.


[Captioner] 20:00:52
WE'VE DONE A VARIETY OF ROOF


[Captioner] 20:00:55
REPLACEMENTS, WE MODERNIZED ELEVATOR


[Captioner] 20:00:59
SYSTEMS IN MANY BUILDINGS DONE 

[Captioner] 20:00:59
SECURITY
UPGRADES.


[Captioner] 20:01:01
THERE'S A NEW STORAGE WAREHOUSE THAT


[Captioner] 20:01:03
BASICALLY REPLACED THE FACILITY THAT 

[Captioner] 20:01:04
WAS


[Captioner] 20:01:07
DEMOLISHED TO BUILD THE DUSTERBERRY


[Captioner] 20:01:09
PARK, AND THEN RIGHT NEXT TO YOU, TO


[Captioner] 20:01:10
YOUR RIGHT AND LEFT, ARE SOME OF THE


[Captioner] 20:01:13
COVID CONTROLS, YOU KNOW, THAT WERE


[Captioner] 20:01:15
INSTALLED AS WELL, NOT JUST HERE IN 

[Captioner] 20:01:15
THE


[Captioner] 20:01:18
COUNCIL CHAMBERS BUT IN OTHER 

[Captioner] 20:01:18
BUILDINGS


[Captioner] 20:01:20
TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC AS WELL AS OUR


[Captioner] 20:01:20
WORKFORCE.


[Captioner] 20:01:24
SO SOME OF THE CURRENT EFFORTS THAT WE


[Captioner] 20:01:28
HAVE PRIMARILY FUNDED WITH THE


[Captioner] 20:01:31
$2 MILLION ANNUALLY FROM THE GENERAL


[Captioner] 20:01:32
FUND INCLUDE CONTINUING TO JUST TAKE


[Captioner] 20:01:37
CARE OF THE BASICS AND


[Captioner] 20:01:37
KEEPING OUR FACILITIES RUNNING.


[Captioner] 20:01:41
SO WE HAVE OUTDATED FIRE ALARM 

[Captioner] 20:01:41
SYSTEMS,


[Captioner] 20:01:43
SPRINKLERS, BACKUP GENERATORS.


[Captioner] 20:01:47
THE COUNCIL AWARDED A PROJECT TO 

[Captioner] 20:01:47
IMPROVE


[Captioner] 20:01:50
THE FIRING RANGE USED BY THE POLICE


[Captioner] 20:01:50
DEPARTMENT.


[Captioner] 20:01:53
WE'RE GOING TO BE REPAINTING THE


[Captioner] 20:01:54
IRVINGTON COMMUNITY CENTER.


[Captioner] 20:01:57
WE HAVE A LOT OF OLD SLIDING DOORS 

[Captioner] 20:01:58
THAT


[Captioner] 20:02:00
CONSTANTLY GO OUT AND CREATE ISSUES 

[Captioner] 20:02:00
WITH


[Captioner] 20:02:02
ACCESS, SO THOSE ARE DUE FOR


[Captioner] 20:02:02
REPLACEMENT.


[Captioner] 20:02:04
AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO DO A PROJECT


[Captioner] 20:02:07
HERE AT CITY HALL TO MODERNIZE THE


[Captioner] 20:02:09
RESTROOMS TO MORE OF A TOUCHLESS 

[Captioner] 20:02:09
SYSTEM,


[Captioner] 20:02:11
SO THAT YOU'RE NOT HAVING TO TOUCH


[Captioner] 20:02:14
SOMETHING TO GET A TOWEL, TOUCH


[Captioner] 20:02:16
SOMETHING TO GET THE SOAP, TOUCH


[Captioner] 20:02:18
SOMETHING TO GET THE WATER AND TOUCH


[Captioner] 20:02:18
SOMETHING TO OPEN THE DOOR.


[Captioner] 20:02:21
SO WE'RE DOING -- SO THESE ARE SOME OF


[Captioner] 20:02:23
KIND OF THE SMALL IMPROVEMENTS THAT


[Captioner] 20:02:25
WE'RE ABLE TO DO WITH THE RESOURCES 

[Captioner] 20:02:25
THAT


[Captioner] 20:02:25
WE HAVE.


[Captioner] 20:02:28
ALL RIGHT.


[Captioner] 20:02:31
I'M GOING TO NOW MOVE TO SORT OF THE


[Captioner] 20:02:34
LAST PART HERE OF OUR PRESENTATION, 

[Captioner] 20:02:34
AND


[Captioner] 20:02:37
THIS IS TALKING ABOUT SORT OF OUR


[Captioner] 20:02:41
SUGGESTION OR ADVICE ON HOW DO YOU


[Captioner] 20:02:44
ALLOCATE THE FUNDS THAT HAVE BEEN


[Captioner] 20:02:47
ALLOCATED FROM THE GENERAL FUND TO THE


[Captioner] 20:02:47
CIP PROCESS.


[Captioner] 20:02:51
SO FOR THOSE THAT MAY RECALL AT THE


[Captioner] 20:02:56
COUNCIL RETREAT IN 2022, WE INTRODUCED


[Captioner] 20:03:00
THE IDEA THAT WE HAVE A BILLION


[Captioner] 20:03:01
DOLLARS WORTH OF THINGS THAT WE NEED 

[Captioner] 20:03:01
TO


[Captioner] 20:03:03
DO TO SORT OF ADDRESS URGENT CURRENT


[Captioner] 20:03:04
NEEDS THAT WE HAVE.


[Captioner] 20:03:06
MANY WITH THEIR BUILDINGS AND


[Captioner] 20:03:06
FACILITIES.


[Captioner] 20:03:08
BUT WE'RE ALSO FORESEEING THAT THERE'S


[Captioner] 20:03:11
OTHER NEEDS THAT WE HAVE, AND MANY OF


[Captioner] 20:03:15
THEM HAVE BEEN RECOMMENDED OUT OF 

[Captioner] 20:03:15
PLANS


[Captioner] 20:03:16
THAT THE COUNCIL HAS ADOPTED.


[Captioner] 20:03:19
LIKE THE MOBILITY ACTION PLAN OR PARKS


[Captioner] 20:03:20
AND REC. MASTER PLAN.


[Captioner] 20:03:23
SO THERE'S -- THIS IS KIND OF WHAT 

[Captioner] 20:03:23
MAKES


[Captioner] 20:03:25
UP, YOU KNOW, THAT BILLION DOLLARS.


[Captioner] 20:03:31
SO WHAT WE'D LIKE TO DO IS GIVE YOU 

[Captioner] 20:03:31
ALL


[Captioner] 20:03:33
THE BENEFIT OF STAFF'S ADVICE ON WHERE


[Captioner] 20:03:37
WE THINK THOSE FUNDS COULD BE BEST


[Captioner] 20:03:38
ALLOCATED AND WHAT WE CONSIDER THE


[Captioner] 20:03:39
URGENT PRIORITIES.


[Captioner] 20:03:44
AND JUST SO FROM A PROCESS 

[Captioner] 20:03:44
PERSPECTIVE,


[Captioner] 20:03:46
OUR CITY MANAGER, KARENA SHACKELFORD,


[Captioner] 20:03:49
YOU KNOW, WANTED US TO REACH OUT TO 

[Captioner] 20:03:49
THE


[Captioner] 20:03:54
ORGANIZATION, TO EACH DEPARTMENT, AND


[Captioner] 20:03:57
IDENTIFY WHAT DEPARTMENTS FELT WAS 

[Captioner] 20:03:57
MOST


[Captioner] 20:03:58
CRITICAL AND URGENT FOR THEM TO 

[Captioner] 20:03:59
CONTINUE


[Captioner] 20:04:01
THEIR OPERATIONS, THE FACILITIES THAT


[Captioner] 20:04:05
THEY'RE IN, AND PUT TOGETHER KIND OF A


[Captioner] 20:04:06
STAFF-GENERATED LIST OF WHAT WE 

[Captioner] 20:04:06
THOUGHT


[Captioner] 20:04:06
WAS MOST URGENT.


[Captioner] 20:04:09
AND WITH THE MONEY THAT WE HAVE,


[Captioner] 20:04:11
UNFORTUNATELY IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO EVEN


[Captioner] 20:04:15
COVER EVERYTHING THAT CAME UP FROM THE


[Captioner] 20:04:16
STAFF ORGANIZATION, AND WE KNOW 

[Captioner] 20:04:16
THERE'S


[Captioner] 20:04:19
A LOT OF OTHER THINGS TOO THAT WE HEAR


[Captioner] 20:04:23
FROM THE COMMUNITY WE WANT TO DO, AND 

[Captioner] 20:04:24
SO


[Captioner] 20:04:26
KIND OF THE CHALLENGES FIGURING OUT


[Captioner] 20:04:27
WHERE TO FOCUS OUR EFFORTS.


[Captioner] 20:04:30
SO BASED ON KIND OF OUR PROFESSIONAL


[Captioner] 20:04:32
ADVICE OF WHAT WE THINK IS MOST


[Captioner] 20:04:34
IMPORTANT, AND I THINK IT FALLS INTO 

[Captioner] 20:04:34
TWO
THEMES.


[Captioner] 20:04:38
ONE IS, WE HAVE STUFF THAT'S FALLING


[Captioner] 20:04:40
APART, PAST ITS USEFUL LIFE, THAT IS 

[Captioner] 20:04:40
NOT


[Captioner] 20:04:44
GOING TO BE ABLE TO SERVE THE PUBLIC 

[Captioner] 20:04:44
IF


[Captioner] 20:04:45
THESE THINGS BREAK DOWN.


[Captioner] 20:04:49
WE'RE GOING TO BE GOING BACKWARDS IN


[Captioner] 20:04:50
TERMS OF THE SERVICES WE PROVIDE.


[Captioner] 20:04:52
WE HAVE A LOT OF THINGS THAT NEED TO 

[Captioner] 20:04:52
BE
FIXED.


[Captioner] 20:04:55
THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT WE ARE


[Captioner] 20:04:59
MANDATED TO DO, SUCH AS ELECTRIFYING 

[Captioner] 20:05:00
OUR


[Captioner] 20:05:01
VEHICLE FLEETS.


[Captioner] 20:05:03
SO WE DON'T REALLY HAVE A CHOICE IN 

[Captioner] 20:05:03
SOME


[Captioner] 20:05:04
OF THESE THINGS, WE NEED TO DO THESE.


[Captioner] 20:05:08
SO WE'RE GOING TO GO THROUGH KIND OF 

[Captioner] 20:05:08
IN


[Captioner] 20:05:10
SOME DETAIL WHAT THESE -- WHAT WE


[Captioner] 20:05:14
CONSIDER ARE THE STAFF'S OR THE CITY'S


[Captioner] 20:05:15
URGENT PRIORITIES, AND WE'LL START IT


[Captioner] 20:05:18
OFF WITH SUZANNE WOLF AND KIND OF THE


[Captioner] 20:05:19
PARK AND RECREATION FACILITIES.


[Captioner] 20:05:24
>> Ms. Wolf: THANK YOU, HANS.


[Captioner] 20:05:27

[Captioner] 20:05:30
HIGHEST COMMUNITY PRIORITIES IN THE

[Captioner] 20:05:40
CITY


[Captioner] 20:05:43
OF FREMONT CURRENTLY ONLY HAS ONE CITY


[Captioner] 20:05:44
GYMNASIUM LOCATED AT THE IRVINGTON


[Captioner] 20:05:47
COMMUNITY CENTER THAT HAS LITTLE TO NO


[Captioner] 20:05:49
AVAILABILITY GIVEN THAT IT'S USED ALL


[Captioner] 20:05:49
DAY LONG.


[Captioner] 20:05:51

[Captioner] 20:05:51
STEP


[Captioner] 20:05:54

THE


[Captioner] 20:06:29
NEW FACILITY IS $58 MILLION WITH A


[Captioner] 20:06:30
FIVE-YEAR IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY.


[Captioner] 20:06:34
THE CITY HAS RECEIVED $9 MILLION STATE


[Captioner] 20:06:36
AND CITY FUNDS TO ASSIST IN THE


[Captioner] 20:06:38
PLANNING, DESIGN, AND INITIAL


[Captioner] 20:06:39
CONSTRUCTION COSTS.


[Captioner] 20:06:43
IN ADDITION TO TODAY'S REQUEST OF


[Captioner] 20:06:45
$21 MILLION, WE WILL CONTINUE TO SEEK


[Captioner] 20:06:47
ADDITIONAL FUNDS THROUGH STATE, 

[Captioner] 20:06:47
FEDERAL


[Captioner] 20:06:47
AND PRIVATE FUNDING.


[Captioner] 20:06:53
PARK RESTROOMS, REPLACEMENT WAS ALSO A


[Captioner] 20:06:56
TOP PRIORITY OF THE COMMUNITY FROM THE


[Captioner] 20:06:57
PARK AND RECREATION MASTER PLAN.


[Captioner] 20:07:00
WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT STRUCTURAL ISSUES,


[Captioner] 20:07:03
ANTIQUATED BUILDINGS AND/OR POOR


[Captioner] 20:07:05
PLUMBING DESIGN AND FUNCTIONALITY.


[Captioner] 20:07:08
A PROPOSED $15 MILLION GENERAL FUND


[Captioner] 20:07:10
CONTRIBUTION WILL PROVIDE FOR A PHASED


[Captioner] 20:07:11
PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION.


[Captioner] 20:07:20
THE PROPOSAL FOR $826,000 IS TO 

[Captioner] 20:07:20
REPLACE


[Captioner] 20:07:23
THE ORIGINAL TURF, THE LARGE DOG PARK 

[Captioner] 20:07:24
AS


[Captioner] 20:07:27
IT HAS OUTLASTED ITS LIFESPAN AND IS 

[Captioner] 20:07:28
IN


[Captioner] 20:07:29
POOR QUALITY AND IS A SAFETY HAZARD.


[Captioner] 20:07:31
THAT WILL REPLACE THE SYNTHETIC TURF


[Captioner] 20:07:33
CARPET THAT HAS EXCEEDED ITS LIFESPAN.


[Captioner] 20:07:37
AND FINALLY, WE HAVE TO REPLACE THE


[Captioner] 20:07:40
DEGRADING AND DAMAGED TRANSFORMER THAT


[Captioner] 20:07:44
IS PROPOSED AT CENTRAL PARK AT


[Captioner] 20:07:46
FIELDS 1 AND 2 AS IT IS A SAFETY ITEM 

[Captioner] 20:07:46
IN


[Captioner] 20:07:48
ORDER FOR US TO HAVE THE LIGHTING 

[Captioner] 20:07:48
SYSTEM


[Captioner] 20:07:49
WORK EFFECTIVELY.


[Captioner] 20:07:51
AND WITH THAT, I WILL TURN IT BACK TO


[Captioner] 20:07:52
HANS TO TALK ABOUT THE OTHER TWO 

[Captioner] 20:07:52
ITEMS.


[Captioner] 20:07:56
>> Mr. Larsen: THANK YOU, SUZANNE.


[Captioner] 20:07:59
SO THE NEXT ITEM THAT WE CONSIDER AN


[Captioner] 20:08:01
URGENT PRIORITY IS REHABILITATING THE


[Captioner] 20:08:03
EXISTING CITY HALL BUILDING HERE.


[Captioner] 20:08:07
AND AS COUNCIL IS AWARE, WE HAD AT ONE


[Captioner] 20:08:10
POINT A VISION TO SORT OF REPLACE CITY


[Captioner] 20:08:14
HALL IN THE DEVELOPMENT CENTER AND THE


[Captioner] 20:08:18
FRC, BUT IT REALLY ISN'T -- THERE 

[Captioner] 20:08:18
REALLY


[Captioner] 20:08:20
ISN'T THE RESOURCES IN ORDER TO TAKE 

[Captioner] 20:08:20
ON


[Captioner] 20:08:20
THAT PROJECT.


[Captioner] 20:08:22
WE HAD BEEN DEFERRING MAINTENANCE ON 

[Captioner] 20:08:23
THE


[Captioner] 20:08:25
CITY HALL FACILITY WITH THE 

[Captioner] 20:08:25
EXPECTATION


[Captioner] 20:08:27
THAT, HEY, WE'RE GOING TO BE TEARING


[Captioner] 20:08:29
THIS DOWN AND BUILDING SOMETHING NEW.


[Captioner] 20:08:33
SO WE'RE VIEWING THAT THAT NEW CITY 

[Captioner] 20:08:33
HALL


[Captioner] 20:08:35
IS NOT SORT OF IN THE CARDS IN THE 

[Captioner] 20:08:35
NEAR


[Captioner] 20:08:37
TERM, AND WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO SORT 

[Captioner] 20:08:37
OF


[Captioner] 20:08:39
PROP UP THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE


[Captioner] 20:08:40
EXISTING CITY HALL BUILDING.


[Captioner] 20:08:44
WE HAVE SEVERAL ROOF LEAKS IN IT WITH


[Captioner] 20:08:48
THE OLD FLAT ROOF STRUCTURE, WE HAVE 

[Captioner] 20:08:49
THE


[Captioner] 20:08:51
HEATING VENTILATION HVAC SYSTEM IS


[Captioner] 20:08:53
OUTDATED AND NEEDS REPLACING AS WELL 

[Captioner] 20:08:54
AS


[Captioner] 20:08:55
FIRE ALARM SYSTEMS AND DEVELOPMENT


[Captioner] 20:08:55
AGREEMENT ACCESS.


[Captioner] 20:09:01
AND SO TO REHABILITATE THE BUILD SOG 

[Captioner] 20:09:01
IT


[Captioner] 20:09:05
 BUILDING SO IT HAS AT LEAST ANOTHER


[Captioner] 20:09:09
10 YEARS OF LIFE, YOU'D HAVE THE COST 

[Captioner] 20:09:09
OF
$5 MILLION.


[Captioner] 20:09:14
SO IN ADDITION TO THE HEATING


[Captioner] 20:09:16
VENTILATION AND AIR CONDITIONING 

[Captioner] 20:09:16
SYSTEM


[Captioner] 20:09:20
AT CITY HALL, WE HAVE 11 OTHER CITY


[Captioner] 20:09:24
BUILDINGS WITH HVAC SYSTEMS THAT ARE 

[Captioner] 20:09:24
20,


[Captioner] 20:09:27
30 YEARS OLD, THAT ARE ACTUALLY


[Captioner] 20:09:30
OPERATING WITH FREON WHICH IS A BANNED


[Captioner] 20:09:30
SUBSTANCE.


[Captioner] 20:09:33
AND SO IT IS VERY -- YOU CAN'T BUILD 

[Captioner] 20:09:34
--


[Captioner] 20:09:36
YOU CAN'T INSTALL A NEW ONE ANYMORE, 

[Captioner] 20:09:36
BUT


[Captioner] 20:09:39
WE'VE BEEN KEEPING THESE THINGS 

[Captioner] 20:09:39
RUNNING,


[Captioner] 20:09:41
AND WE'RE GOING TO GET TO A POINT 

[Captioner] 20:09:41
WHERE


[Captioner] 20:09:44
WE CAN'T EVEN GET FREON ANYMORE IN 

[Captioner] 20:09:44
ORDER


[Captioner] 20:09:45
TO CONTINUE FUNCTIONALITY.


[Captioner] 20:09:50
SO WE FEEL IT'S URGENT TO REPLACE 

[Captioner] 20:09:50
THESE


[Captioner] 20:09:50
FACILITIES.


[Captioner] 20:09:53
AND IT ALSO WAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK


[Captioner] 20:09:56
AT REPLACING THEM WITH ELECTRIC 

[Captioner] 20:09:56
SYSTEM,


[Captioner] 20:09:59
WHICH HELPS SUPPORT KIND OF OUR 

[Captioner] 20:09:59
CLIMATE


[Captioner] 20:09:59
ACTION GOALS.


[Captioner] 20:10:04
SO TO KIND OF PHASE OUT THESE OLD


[Captioner] 20:10:08
SYSTEMS FOR 11 ADDITIONAL BUILDINGS IN


[Captioner] 20:10:09
CITY HALL HAS A COST OF $8 MILLION.


[Captioner] 20:10:14
WE DO HAVE SOME PUBLIC SAFETY 

[Captioner] 20:10:17
FACILITIES


[Captioner] 20:10:17
THAT ARE URGENT.


[Captioner] 20:10:21
THERE IS A PLAN AMONG ALL THE CITIES


[Captioner] 20:10:25
WITHIN THE COUNCIL TEAL TO MOVE TO A 

[Captioner] 20:10:25
NEW


[Captioner] 20:10:27
COORDINATED COMMUNICATION SYSTEM, AND 

[Captioner] 20:10:27
SO


[Captioner] 20:10:29
THIS IS ESSENTIALLY GOING TO BE


[Captioner] 20:10:32
SOMETHING THAT WILL BE REQUIRED TO DO 

[Captioner] 20:10:32
TO


[Captioner] 20:10:32
ALIGN WITH THAT.


[Captioner] 20:10:38
THERE IS ALSO A PROJECT AT THE POLICE


[Captioner] 20:10:39
DEPARTMENT THAT NEEDS SOME ADDITIONAL


[Captioner] 20:10:44
FUNDING TO CREATE A SECURE PLACE TO


[Captioner] 20:10:47
STORE VEHICLES THAT ARE PART OF 

[Captioner] 20:10:48
EVIDENCE
NEEDS.


[Captioner] 20:10:52
AND SO THERE'S A LOW COST STORAGE


[Captioner] 20:10:54
FACILITY THAT WE NEED TO COMPLETELY 

[Captioner] 20:10:54
FUND


[Captioner] 20:10:56
IN ORDER TO SUPPORT THAT SERVICE, AND 

[Captioner] 20:10:57
TO


[Captioner] 20:11:01
MEET STANDARDS FOR KIND OF SECURING


[Captioner] 20:11:04
EVIDENCE THAT'S BEEN PART OF SOME


[Captioner] 20:11:04
CRIMINAL ACTIVITY.


[Captioner] 20:11:13
SO AS I MENTIONED, WE ARE FACING


[Captioner] 20:11:14
MANDATES TO ELECTRIFY OUR VEHICLE


[Captioner] 20:11:14
FLEET.


[Captioner] 20:11:16
IN FACT, WE'RE HAPPY TO DO THIS AND 

[Captioner] 20:11:17
HAVE


[Captioner] 20:11:20
BEEN A LEADER IN VEHICLE


[Captioner] 20:11:21
ELECTRIFICATION, PARTICULARLY


[Captioner] 20:11:24
DEMONSTRATING HOW A POLICE PATROL


[Captioner] 20:11:26
VEHICLE CAN FUNCTION AS AN ELECTRIC


[Captioner] 20:11:26
VEHICLE.


[Captioner] 20:11:31
UNFORTUNATE WE'VE NOT BEEN ABLE TO


[Captioner] 20:11:32
SECURE ANY GRANTS FOR THIS PURPOSE.


[Captioner] 20:11:35
MOST OF THE GRANTS ARE ORIENTED 

[Captioner] 20:11:36
TOWARDS


[Captioner] 20:11:41
SERVING THE PUBLIC, AND THEIR VEHICLE


[Captioner] 20:11:42
ELECTRIFICATION NEEDS, AND SO AS 

[Captioner] 20:11:43
CITIES,


[Captioner] 20:11:47
WE'RE SOMEWHAT ON OUR OWN, AND WE ARE


[Captioner] 20:11:50
SEEING A NEED TO SORT OF INVEST IN THE


[Captioner] 20:11:54
CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE SO THAT WE CAN


[Captioner] 20:11:56
CONTINUE TO DO OUR CONVERSION PROGRAM.


[Captioner] 20:12:01
AND THEN LASTLY, THIS IS KIND OF A NEW


[Captioner] 20:12:03
ONE, AND WE'RE STILL SORT OF FEELING 

[Captioner] 20:12:04
THE


[Captioner] 20:12:07
EFFECTS OF A VERY SEVERE STORM SEASON,


[Captioner] 20:12:10
BUT SOME OF OUR INFRASTRUCTURE HAS 

[Captioner] 20:12:10
BEEN


[Captioner] 20:12:13
SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED BY THE STORMS,


[Captioner] 20:12:15
VERY STRIKING EXAMPLE OF WHAT MORRISON


[Captioner] 20:12:17
CANYON ROAD LOOKS LIKE ON THE PICTURE 

[Captioner] 20:12:17
TO


[Captioner] 20:12:18
THE LEFT.


[Captioner] 20:12:20
WE'VE HAD SOME BRIDGE IMPACTS.


[Captioner] 20:12:23
WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO FIX THIS


[Captioner] 20:12:23
INFRASTRUCTURE.


[Captioner] 20:12:26
WE'RE HOPEFUL THAT WE'LL BE ABLE TO 

[Captioner] 20:12:27
GET


[Captioner] 20:12:29
REIMBURSEMENT FROM OTHER AGENCIES BUT


[Captioner] 20:12:32
OFTENTIMES THAT REIMBURSEMENT COMES


[Captioner] 20:12:34
LATER, AND IT'S NOT ALWAYS FULLY


[Captioner] 20:12:36
GUARANTEED, AND SO WE THINK IT'S


[Captioner] 20:12:39
IMPORTANT TO ALLOCATE MONEY TO SORT OF


[Captioner] 20:12:42
TAKE CARE OF THESE NEEDS AS AN URGENT


[Captioner] 20:12:42
PRIORITY AS WELL.


[Captioner] 20:12:48
SO IN CONCLUSION, WE'VE PUT TOGETHER 

[Captioner] 20:12:49
THE


[Captioner] 20:12:52
NEXT SLIDE WHICH SORT OF HIGHLIGHTS --


[Captioner] 20:12:53
AND THESE ARE KIND OF ROUGH NUMBERS OF


[Captioner] 20:12:55
HOW WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS BILLION


[Captioner] 20:12:57
DOLLARS OF NEEDS THAT THE CITY HAS, 

[Captioner] 20:12:57
AND


[Captioner] 20:13:01
SO WHAT YOU'VE HEARD FROM US OR WHAT 

[Captioner] 20:13:01
WE


[Captioner] 20:13:03
CONSIDER URGENT PRIORITIES, THIS IS


[Captioner] 20:13:05
ABOUT 50, $60 MILLION AND YOU SEE THE


[Captioner] 20:13:07
LIST THERE OF THE ITEMS THAT SUZANNE 

[Captioner] 20:13:07
AND


[Captioner] 20:13:11
I JUST MENTIONED.


[Captioner] 20:13:13
WE HAVE A LOT OF OTHER IMPORTANT


[Captioner] 20:13:15
PRIORITIES THAT THE CITY COUNCIL WAS


[Captioner] 20:13:18
ACTUALLY APPROVED PLANS FOR AND SAID 

[Captioner] 20:13:19
WE


[Captioner] 20:13:19
SHOULD BE DOING THESE THINGS.


[Captioner] 20:13:24
BUM THEY'RE PERHAPS NOT AS URGENT OR


[Captioner] 20:13:26
CRITICAL AS OTHER CATEGORIES, AND SO 

[Captioner] 20:13:26
WE


[Captioner] 20:13:29
HAVE OTHER THINGS IN OUR PARK MASTER


[Captioner] 20:13:31
PLAN, PARK AND REC. MASTER PLAN,


[Captioner] 20:13:32
MOBILITY ACTION PLAN.


[Captioner] 20:13:36
WE HAVE A FIBEROPTIC COMMUNICATION


[Captioner] 20:13:38
NETWORK THAT WE HAVE A MASTER PLAN FOR


[Captioner] 20:13:41
THAT NEEDS TO BE FUNDED.


[Captioner] 20:13:44
SUPPORT FOR FIRE FACILITIES THAT


[Captioner] 20:13:45
PROVIDES A LEVEL OF COVERAGE.


[Captioner] 20:13:50
WE ARE REQUIRED TO DO ADA RETROFITS 

[Captioner] 20:13:50
FOR


[Captioner] 20:13:51
OUR SIDEWALKS AND BUILDINGS.


[Captioner] 20:13:54
WE DO HAVE SOME TIME TO DO THAT, BUT


[Captioner] 20:13:57
THAT'S SOMETHING WE NEED TO CONTINUE 

[Captioner] 20:13:57
TO
FUND.


[Captioner] 20:13:59
AND THEN COMING UP, THERE ARE SOME 

[Captioner] 20:13:59
MORE


[Captioner] 20:14:03
MASTER PLANS OUT THERE THAT HAVE GONE


[Captioner] 20:14:05
THROUGH COMMUNITY INPUT PROCESS THAT 

[Captioner] 20:14:05
ARE


[Captioner] 20:14:09
IDENTIFYING NEEDS RELATED TO CLIMATE


[Captioner] 20:14:09
ACTION PLANNING.


[Captioner] 20:14:13
YOU'LL HEAR IN APRIL A NEW URBAN 

[Captioner] 20:14:13
FOREST


[Captioner] 20:14:16
MANAGEMENT PLAN ON PLANTING MORE TREES


[Captioner] 20:14:17
IN FREMONT AND TAKING CARE OF THEM.


[Captioner] 20:14:24
A HAZARD


[Captioner] 20:14:26
MITIGATION PLAN AND HOMELESS 

[Captioner] 20:14:26
STRATEGIES,


[Captioner] 20:14:27
SO THERE'S A LOT MORE OUT THERE THAT'S


[Captioner] 20:14:28
BEEN IDENTIFIED OR COMING.


[Captioner] 20:14:30
AND THEN WE KNOW AND HEAR EITHER 

[Captioner] 20:14:30
THROUGH


[Captioner] 20:14:34
OUR OWN ORGANIZATION OR FROM THE 

[Captioner] 20:14:34
PUBLIC


[Captioner] 20:14:35
THAT THERE'S THINGS THAT THEY WOULD 

[Captioner] 20:14:35
LIKE


[Captioner] 20:14:38
TO SEE, AND SO OUR POLICE CENTER IS 

[Captioner] 20:14:38
ALSO


[Captioner] 20:14:39
AGING AND NEEDS SOME WORK.


[Captioner] 20:14:42
OUR FRIENDS AT THE LIBRARY, WE 

[Captioner] 20:14:42
ACTUALLY


[Captioner] 20:14:44
PROVIDE THE BUILDINGS, THEY OPERATE


[Captioner] 20:14:46
THEM, BUT THEY HAVE SOME WORK TO DO.


[Captioner] 20:14:48
WE HAVE OTHER CITY BUILDINGS.


[Captioner] 20:14:51
WE HAVE A HUGE INVENTORY OF HISTORIC


[Captioner] 20:14:53
BUILDINGS THAT WE'RE NOT ABLE TO DO 

[Captioner] 20:14:53
ANY


[Captioner] 20:14:55
WORK WITH THE RESOURCES WE HAVE IN 

[Captioner] 20:14:55
TERMS


[Captioner] 20:14:56
OF PRESERVATION.


[Captioner] 20:15:00
THERE'S MORE WE CAN DO ON PAVEMENT
REPAIRS.


[Captioner] 20:15:07
MEDIAN ISLAND LANDSCAPING.


[Captioner] 20:15:09
THERE'S A MESSAGE TO THE CITY COUNCIL 

[Captioner] 20:15:09
AS


[Captioner] 20:15:11
PART OF THIS AGENDA ITEM AND I THINK


[Captioner] 20:15:13
THERE MAY BE SOME SPEAKERS HERE 

[Captioner] 20:15:13
TONIGHT


[Captioner] 20:15:16
OF COMMUNITIES THAT ARE ADVOCATING FOR


[Captioner] 20:15:18
MEDIAN ISLAND LANDSCAPE WORK FOR


[Captioner] 20:15:19
BEAUTIFICATION.


[Captioner] 20:15:27
AND THEN THE BIG VISION OF A NEW CITY


[Captioner] 20:15:29
HALL AND FRC, WHICH WE'RE VIEWING AS


[Captioner] 20:15:32
MORE OF A LONG-TERM PLAN, BUT THAT'S


[Captioner] 20:15:33
SOMETHING OUT THERE ON THE HORIZON


[Captioner] 20:15:35
THAT'S BEEN IDENTIFIED AS A CITY NEED.


[Captioner] 20:15:38
SO I THINK, AGAIN, OUR GOAL HERE IS, 

[Captioner] 20:15:39
AS


[Captioner] 20:15:42
WE START THIS PROCESS, IS TO TRY TO 

[Captioner] 20:15:42
PUT


[Captioner] 20:15:44
CERTAIN THINGS INTO KIND OF PRIORITY


[Captioner] 20:15:44
BUCKETS.


[Captioner] 20:15:46
AND SO I THINK WE'RE INTERESTED IN


[Captioner] 20:15:52
HEARING FROM YOU AND THE LAST SLIDE 

[Captioner] 20:15:52
TEES


[Captioner] 20:15:53
THIS UP.


[Captioner] 20:15:55
DO YOU CONCUR WITH WHAT WE'VE SHARED


[Captioner] 20:15:57
WITH YOU AS WHAT STAFF CONSIDERS SORT 

[Captioner] 20:15:57
OF


[Captioner] 20:16:01
THE CITY'S MOST URGENT PRIORITIES FOR


[Captioner] 20:16:03
USE OF THE GENERAL FUND INVESTMENTS 

[Captioner] 20:16:03
THAT


[Captioner] 20:16:06
HAVE BEEN TRANSFERRED TO THE CAPITAL


[Captioner] 20:16:09
PROGRAM, ARE THERE OTHER IDEAS AND


[Captioner] 20:16:11
INTERESTS THAT YOU HAVE THAT YOU WOULD


[Captioner] 20:16:14
LIKE FOR US TO EXPLORE AS WE 50 

[Captioner] 20:16:14
THROUGH


[Captioner] 20:16:15
THE NEXT COUPLE OF MONTHS AND PULL


[Captioner] 20:16:17
TOGETHER THE CIP.


[Captioner] 20:16:20
AGAIN, WE'LL BE COMING BACK TO YOU IN


[Captioner] 20:16:22
MAY WITH A SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATION OF


[Captioner] 20:16:26
HOW WE ALLOCATE FUNDS OUT OF OUR CORE


[Captioner] 20:16:28
PROGRAMS AS WELL AS WITH THE GENERAL


[Captioner] 20:16:28
FUND.


[Captioner] 20:16:31
SO WITH THAT, THAT CONCLUDES OUR


[Captioner] 20:16:31
PRESENTATION.


[Captioner] 20:16:33
HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS.


[Captioner] 20:16:36
I THINK THERE'S SOME INTEREST IN 

[Captioner] 20:16:36
PUBLIC


[Captioner] 20:16:38
INPUT, AND THEN WE'D LOVE TO HEAR YOUR


[Captioner] 20:16:41
 ADVICE OR INPUT TONIGHT.


[Captioner] 20:16:44
AGAIN, NO ACTION, BUT WANTING TO GET


[Captioner] 20:16:46
YOUR THOUGHTS AS WE GET THE PROCESS


[Captioner] 20:16:46
STARTED.


[Captioner] 20:16:46
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:16:51
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:16:56
[INAUDIBLE] -- QUESTIONS.


[Captioner] 20:17:03

[Captioner] 20:17:06
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:17:08
>> Councilmember Shao: THANK YOU FOR


[Captioner] 20:17:08
THE PRESENTATION.


[Captioner] 20:17:14
MY QUESTION IS REGARDING QUIET ZONES.


[Captioner] 20:17:19
IN THE FIRST FEW SLIDES, CENTERVILLE 

[Captioner] 20:17:19
WAS


[Captioner] 20:17:22
INTRODUCED AS ONE OF THE NEAR TERM


[Captioner] 20:17:23
PROJECTS.


[Captioner] 20:17:28
SO DIRECTOR LARSEN, COULD YOU GIVE ME


[Captioner] 20:17:33
JUST A HIGH LEVEL DESCRIPTION OF THE


[Captioner] 20:17:36
QUIET ZONE PROJECTS THAT HAVE BEEN 

[Captioner] 20:17:36
DONE


[Captioner] 20:17:40
AND WILL BE DONE IN THE NEAR FUTURE,


[Captioner] 20:17:45
ESPECIALLY ALONG MISSION BOULEVARD, IN 

[Captioner] 20:17:45
A


[Captioner] 20:17:47
WORN OUT AREA AND THE NILES.


[Captioner] 20:17:50
>> Mr. Larsen: OKAY, YES.


[Captioner] 20:17:50
THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION.


[Captioner] 20:17:56
SO WE DID -- THESE ARE HARD PROJECTS 

[Captioner] 20:17:56
TO


[Captioner] 20:17:58
IMPLEMENT, AND WE'RE PLEASED TO BE 

[Captioner] 20:17:58
ABLE


[Captioner] 20:18:00
TO GET OVER THE GOAL LINE.


[Captioner] 20:18:05
THE QUIET ZONE IN NILES AT THE NURSERY


[Captioner] 20:18:05
CROSSING.


[Captioner] 20:18:12
AND WE HAVE EMBARKED ON THE NEXT STEP


[Captioner] 20:18:17
EFFORT AND HAVE PRIORITIZED A SET OF


[Captioner] 20:18:18
QUIET ZONES IN THE CENTERVILLE AREA.


[Captioner] 20:18:22
SO IT'S A CORRIDOR OF SIX


[Captioner] 20:18:25
LOCATIONS FROM BLACOW AND DUSTERBERRY


[Captioner] 20:18:28
AND FREMONT BOULEVARD AND SHINN, AND


[Captioner] 20:18:30
THAT WAS SELECTED PRIMARILY BECAUSE 

[Captioner] 20:18:31
THAT


[Captioner] 20:18:34
CORRIDOR HAS ALSO BEEN IDENTIFIED AS A


[Captioner] 20:18:37
REGIONAL PRIORITY AND IS ELIGIBLE FOR


[Captioner] 20:18:37
REGIONAL GRANT FUNDING.


[Captioner] 20:18:41
SO WE HAVE IN OUR CURRENT CAPITAL


[Captioner] 20:18:45
PROGRAM MONEYS TO DO THE PLANNING WORK


[Captioner] 20:18:46
TO ADVANCE THAT.


[Captioner] 20:18:50
THEN WE WILL BE TRYING TO GET REGIONAL


[Captioner] 20:18:51
GRANT FUNDS FOR THAT PROJECT.


[Captioner] 20:18:54
THERE IS AN ADDITIONAL PHASE OF WORK


[Captioner] 20:18:56
THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED, AND OUR GOAL IS


[Captioner] 20:18:58
TO HAVE RAILROAD QUIET ZONES FOR ALL 

[Captioner] 20:18:59
OF


[Captioner] 20:18:59
THE CROSSINGS IN FREMONT.


[Captioner] 20:19:04
AND SO THE CORRIDOR THAT YOU 

[Captioner] 20:19:04
MENTIONED,


[Captioner] 20:19:10
COUNCILMEMBER SHAO, SORT OF IN THE


[Captioner] 20:19:12
WALNUT, CENTRAL PARK AND THEN FURTHER


[Captioner] 20:19:14
SOUTH, IS A LATER PHASE THAT WE WOULD


[Captioner] 20:19:16
LIKE TO DO.


[Captioner] 20:19:20
WE'RE RECOMMENDING A FOCUS ON


[Captioner] 20:19:23
CENTERVILLE TO FOCUS OUR EFFORTS AND 

[Captioner] 20:19:23
THE


[Captioner] 20:19:26
WORK WITH THE RAILROAD COMPANIES TO DO


[Captioner] 20:19:26
THAT ONE.


[Captioner] 20:19:30
AND THEN OUR CURRENT COURSE AND


[Captioner] 20:19:32
RECOMMENDATION IS, YOU KNOW, WE GET 

[Captioner] 20:19:32
THE


[Captioner] 20:19:36
CENTERVILLE AREA DONE AND THEN WE WORK


[Captioner] 20:19:38
TO ADDRESS OTHER PROJECTS ACROSS THE


[Captioner] 20:19:38
CITY.


[Captioner] 20:19:40
SO THAT'S THE APPROACH THAT WE'RE 

[Captioner] 20:19:40
TAKING


[Captioner] 20:19:42
AT THIS TIME.


[Captioner] 20:19:44
>> City Mgr. Shackelford: HANS, CAN


[Captioner] 20:19:46
YOU SAY A LITTLE MORE ABOUT THE


[Captioner] 20:19:48
DIFFICULTY WITH IMPLEMENTING QUIET


[Captioner] 20:19:50
ZONES, THE LENGTH OF TIME IT TAKES AND


[Captioner] 20:19:52
THE COORDINATION WITH THE VARIOUS


[Captioner] 20:19:52
STAKEHOLDERS?


[Captioner] 20:19:56
>> Mr. Larsen: YEAH, THESE, AS I


[Captioner] 20:19:58
MENTIONED EARLIER, ARE VERY 

[Captioner] 20:19:58
CHALLENGING


[Captioner] 20:20:00
PROJECTS AND IT INVOLVES BUILDING 

[Captioner] 20:20:02
SAFETY


[Captioner] 20:20:04
IMPROVEMENTS AT THE CROSSINGS AND THE


[Captioner] 20:20:09
WORK HAS TO BE DONE BY THE RAILROAD


[Captioner] 20:20:11
OPERATORS OR OWNER, AND IN THIS CASE, 

[Captioner] 20:20:11
IS


[Captioner] 20:20:12
UNION PACIFIC RAILROAD.


[Captioner] 20:20:17
SO THERE'S A LIMITATION ON THEIR


[Captioner] 20:20:19
RESOURCES TO SUPPORT CITY REQUESTS FOR


[Captioner] 20:20:22
QUIET ZONES AND TO ACTUALLY, IF YOU


[Captioner] 20:20:23
REACH AN AGREEMENT AND GET THE FUNDING


[Captioner] 20:20:26
TO DO THIS, THEN THE WORK HAS TO BE


[Captioner] 20:20:30
SCHEDULED WITH THEM, AND SO THESE ARE 

[Captioner] 20:20:30
--


[Captioner] 20:20:32
JUST TAKING -- SOME WOULD SAY THE 

[Captioner] 20:20:33
NILES


[Captioner] 20:20:34
EXPERIENCE TOOK A DECADE.


[Captioner] 20:20:38
IT TOOK PROBABLY SEVEN YEARS OF 

[Captioner] 20:20:38
FIGHTING


[Captioner] 20:20:41
WITH THE RAILROAD, THEN WE REALIZED 

[Captioner] 20:20:41
THE


[Captioner] 20:20:43
THE ONLY WAY WE WOULD GET IT IS TO 

[Captioner] 20:20:43
WORK


[Captioner] 20:20:45
IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THEM, SO WE WERE


[Captioner] 20:20:46
ABLE TO GET THAT ONE DONE.


[Captioner] 20:20:47
BUT THAT WAS ONE THAT TOOK A LONG 

[Captioner] 20:20:48
TIME.


[Captioner] 20:20:51
SO WE HAVE A VERY COMPLICATED CORRIDOR


[Captioner] 20:20:53
IN CENTERVILLE THAT INCLUDES SIX


[Captioner] 20:20:54
CROSSINGS.


[Captioner] 20:20:59
SO IT'S A LOT OF STAFF WORK, 

[Captioner] 20:20:59
CONSULTANT


[Captioner] 20:21:03
WORK, AND COORDINATION WITH P.U.C. AND


[Captioner] 20:21:07
THE RAILROADS TO BE


[Captioner] 20:21:08
ABLE TO DO THESE, SO YES, THESE ARE 

[Captioner] 20:21:10
HARD


[Captioner] 20:21:11
PROJECTS, BUT WE DO HARD STUFF.


[Captioner] 20:21:13
>> Councilmember Shao: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:21:18
>> Ms. Gauthier: COUNCILMEMBER


[Captioner] 20:21:18
KASSAN.


[Captioner] 20:21:21
>> Councilmember Kassan: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:21:23
I'M GENERALLY IN AGREEMENT.


[Captioner] 20:21:24
I JUST HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS.


[Captioner] 20:21:29
ONE IS, HOW DOES THIS TIE IN TO ITEM 

[Captioner] 20:21:29
2C


[Captioner] 20:21:33
ON THE AGENDA, WITH THE ITEMS THAT 

[Captioner] 20:21:33
WERE


[Captioner] 20:21:36
BEING DEFUNDED, IS THERE A 

[Captioner] 20:21:36
RELATIONSHIP


[Captioner] 20:21:39
BETWEEN WHAT'S BEING PROPOSED AND THE


[Captioner] 20:21:41
ITEMS THAT WERE DEFUNDED UNDER ITEM 

[Captioner] 20:21:41
2C?


[Captioner] 20:21:43
>> Mr. Larsen: YEAH, THAT'S A GREAT


[Captioner] 20:21:43
QUESTION.


[Captioner] 20:21:45
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN.


[Captioner] 20:21:48
AND IT'S NOT A COINCIDENCE THAT THESE


[Captioner] 20:21:51
ARE ON THE SAME AGENDA.


[Captioner] 20:21:56
THE ITEM 2C, CAPITAL PROJECT SORT OF


[Captioner] 20:22:00
CLOSEOUT AND CLEAN-UP PROCESS, AND


[Captioner] 20:22:03
TYPICALLY WHAT WE WILL DO IS WE 

[Captioner] 20:22:03
PREPARE


[Captioner] 20:22:07
FOR THE CIP, IS THAT THE TYPICAL


[Captioner] 20:22:09
KAILSES, WE HAVE PROJECTS THAT ARE


[Captioner] 20:22:11
COMPLETED, WE WANT TO CLOSE THEM OUT,


[Captioner] 20:22:14
GET THEM OFF THE BOOKS AND OFTEN TIMES


[Captioner] 20:22:15
THERE'S SOME CONTINGENCY MONEY 

[Captioner] 20:22:15
AVAILABLE


[Captioner] 20:22:17
THAT WE CAN USE TO REPROGRAM.


[Captioner] 20:22:20
AND SO THE COUNCIL ACTION IS KIND OF


[Captioner] 20:22:21
CLEANING THOSE THINGS UP.


[Captioner] 20:22:25
THIS YEAR, THERE'S KIND OF A UNIQUE


[Captioner] 20:22:29
SITUATION IN THAT WE'RE ALSO HAVING TO


[Captioner] 20:22:32
ADDRESS A SIGNIFICANT DOWNTURN IN


[Captioner] 20:22:36
 DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEES, SO THAT


[Captioner] 20:22:39
WE'RE HAVING TO KIND OF PULL MONEY 

[Captioner] 20:22:39
FROM


[Captioner] 20:22:43
OTHER PROJECTS IN ORDER TO BALANCE THE


[Captioner] 20:22:45
BOOK, SO TO SPEAK, SO THAT WE'RE


[Captioner] 20:22:47
STARTING THIS PROCESS WITH KIND OF A


[Captioner] 20:22:48
BALANCED APPROACH.


[Captioner] 20:22:54
THERE WERE SOME QUESTIONS FROM COUNCIL


[Captioner] 20:22:57
AND WE APPRECIATE THAT, AND THERE WAS 

[Captioner] 20:22:57
A


[Captioner] 20:23:01
QUESTION IN THE PACKET TOO THAT --


[Captioner] 20:23:03
RAISING CONCERNS ABOUT, HEY, WHAT'S


[Captioner] 20:23:04
GOING TO HAPPEN WITH THESE PROJECTS?


[Captioner] 20:23:09
AND SO EVERY PROJECT THAT WE HAVE IS


[Captioner] 20:23:09
CONTINUING.


[Captioner] 20:23:14
WE'RE NOT TAKING ACTION TO DROP ANY


[Captioner] 20:23:15
PROJECTS.


[Captioner] 20:23:18
SOME PROJECTS LIKE DUSTERBERRY PARK IS


[Captioner] 20:23:23
IN THERE WITH A REDUCTION IN FUNDING,


[Captioner] 20:23:25
BUT FORTUNATELY, SUZANNE AND HER TEAM


[Captioner] 20:23:28
WERE ABLE TO GET A STATE GRANT, AND SO


[Captioner] 20:23:30
THAT STATE GRANT FULLY FUNDS THE 

[Captioner] 20:23:30
PROJECT


[Captioner] 20:23:33
AND ACTUALLY ALLOWS US TO PULL MONEY


[Captioner] 20:23:35
FROM THE PROJECT AND USE FOR OTHER


[Captioner] 20:23:35
PURPOSES.


[Captioner] 20:23:38
SO THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO IMPACT TO THE


[Captioner] 20:23:38
DUSTERBERRY PARK.


[Captioner] 20:23:40
IT'S UNDER CONSTRUCTION, IT WILL OPEN 

[Captioner] 20:23:41
ON
SCHEDULE.


[Captioner] 20:23:47
BULL WE'RE REALLOCATING SAVINGS 

[Captioner] 20:23:47
BECAUSE


[Captioner] 20:23:48
OF THE GRANT FROM THAT.


[Captioner] 20:23:51
THERE ARE A FEW THINGS, I'LL JUST SORT


[Captioner] 20:23:55
OF POINT OUT THAT ARE BEING DELAYED 

[Captioner] 20:23:55
ARE


[Captioner] 20:23:57
NEW TRAFFIC SIGNALS AND SIGNAL


[Captioner] 20:24:00
MODERNIZATION, WHICH HAS BEEN FUNDED 

[Captioner] 20:24:00
BY


[Captioner] 20:24:04
DEVELOPMENT IMPACT  FEES, IS GOING TO


[Captioner] 20:24:05
SHOWDOWN, SO WE HAD TO PULL SOME MONEY


[Captioner] 20:24:06
FROM THERE.


[Captioner] 20:24:11
THERE'S A CENTRAL PARK LOOP TRAIL


[Captioner] 20:24:13
PROJECT, WHICH IS ALSO HAVING TO BE


[Captioner] 20:24:16
RESCHEDULE BECAUSE THERE'S NOT ENOUGH


[Captioner] 20:24:17
MONEY TO KEEP THAT ON THE ORIGINAL


[Captioner] 20:24:18
SCHEDULE.


[Captioner] 20:24:21
AND THEN THE PACIFIC COMMONS SPORT 

[Captioner] 20:24:21
PARK


[Captioner] 20:24:24
IS BEING PHASED, SO WORK CAN BE MOVED


[Captioner] 20:24:26
FORWARD WITH THE MONEYS WE HAVE, AND


[Captioner] 20:24:28
THEN SUZANNE AND HER TEAM ARE ALSO


[Captioner] 20:24:33
LOOKING AT SOME PARTNERSHIP


[Captioner] 20:24:34
OPPORTUNITIES TO DEVELOP OTHER PARTS 

[Captioner] 20:24:34
OF
THAT.


[Captioner] 20:24:36
SO THERE'S KIND OF A CREATIVE PROCESS 

[Captioner] 20:24:37
OF


[Captioner] 20:24:39
LOOKING AT ARE THERE DIFFERENT WAYS 

[Captioner] 20:24:40
THAT


[Captioner] 20:24:42
WE CAN FUND THESE AND KEEP EVERYTHING


[Captioner] 20:24:42
GOING.


[Captioner] 20:24:45
SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE NOT


[Captioner] 20:24:46
DROPPING ANYTHING BUT A FEW THINGS IS


[Captioner] 20:24:46
CHANGED.


[Captioner] 20:24:49
SORT OF WHAT'S OPEN IN THIS PROCESS, 

[Captioner] 20:24:49
IF


[Captioner] 20:24:55
WE WANT TO REINVEST MONEYS OUT OF A


[Captioner] 20:24:57
REGULAR CAPITAL PROGRAM TO THOSE, 

[Captioner] 20:24:57
THAT'S


[Captioner] 20:24:59
SOMETHING THAT CAN BE CONSIDERED OVER


[Captioner] 20:25:00
THE NEXT COUPLE OF MONTHS.


[Captioner] 20:25:03
SO I HOPE THAT GAVE YOU SORT OF THE


[Captioner] 20:25:05
CONTEXT TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION.


[Captioner] 20:25:07
>> Councilmember Kassan: WELL, I KNOW


[Captioner] 20:25:09
THE SIGNAL MODERNIZATION PROJECTS ARE


[Captioner] 20:25:12
VERY, VERY POPULAR BECAUSE THERE HAVE


[Captioner] 20:25:14
BEEN A LOT OF COMPLAINTS ABOUT 

[Captioner] 20:25:14
TRAFFIC.


[Captioner] 20:25:18
SO I'M WONDERING IF -- WE COULD


[Captioner] 20:25:21
ALLOCATE SOME OF THE FUNDING THAT IS


[Captioner] 20:25:23
AVAILABLE AND THE ADDITIONAL FUNDS 

[Captioner] 20:25:23
THAT


[Captioner] 20:25:25
WERE ALLOCATED TOWARDS BACKFILLING 

[Captioner] 20:25:26
THOSE


[Captioner] 20:25:29
PROJECTS THAT HAVE TO BE DEFUNDED 

[Captioner] 20:25:29
UNDER
ITEM 2C.


[Captioner] 20:25:32
>> Mr. Larsen: I WOULD SAY THERE'S


[Captioner] 20:25:33
KIND OF TWO OPTIONS.


[Captioner] 20:25:38
SO THERE IS -- THERE'S A CHUNK OF 

[Captioner] 20:25:38
MONEY


[Captioner] 20:25:40
IN THE TRANSPORTATION CAPITAL


[Captioner] 20:25:42
IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM AND THERE'S A 

[Captioner] 20:25:43
STRONG


[Captioner] 20:25:47
DESIRE TO REALLY FOCUS OUR EXISTING


[Captioner] 20:25:48
TRANSPORTATION MONEYS ON THAT.


[Captioner] 20:25:49
THAT'S SOMETHING WE CAN DO.


[Captioner] 20:25:51
THERE IS THE OPTION, TOO, TO USE SOME 

[Captioner] 20:25:51
OF


[Captioner] 20:25:54
THE GENERAL FUND MONEYS FOR THAT.


[Captioner] 20:25:55
PURPOSE AS WELL.


[Captioner] 20:25:59
I CAN SORT OF GIVE YOU MY SORT OF VIEW


[Captioner] 20:26:05
ON IT, I THINK THERE ARE SO MANY OTHER


[Captioner] 20:26:07
CRITICAL PRIORITIES THAT DON'T HAVE 

[Captioner] 20:26:07
THE


[Captioner] 20:26:11
OPTION OF BEING FUNDED BY OTHER 

[Captioner] 20:26:11
SOURCES


[Captioner] 20:26:14
SO I THINK OUR STAFF PERSPECTIVE IS 

[Captioner] 20:26:14
SORT


[Captioner] 20:26:18
OF A NOT FUNDING SIGNAL MODERNIZATION


[Captioner] 20:26:20
OUT OF THAT AND USE THE EXISTING 

[Captioner] 20:26:20
MONEYS


[Captioner] 20:26:20
WE HAVE.


[Captioner] 20:26:24
YOU KNOW, IT'S AN AREA THAT I'D HOPED


[Captioner] 20:26:26
WE'D BE ABLE TO SECURE GRANTS FOR BUT 

[Captioner] 20:26:26
AS


[Captioner] 20:26:30
I MENTIONED, BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE 

[Captioner] 20:26:30
THAT


[Captioner] 20:26:33
HISTORICALLY DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITY


[Captioner] 20:26:34
DESIGNATION WE'RE REALLY NOT ABLE TO


[Captioner] 20:26:36
SORT OF GET A LOT OF THE MONEY THAT'S


[Captioner] 20:26:38
OUT THERE FROM DIFFERENT PROGRAMS.


[Captioner] 20:26:39
>> Councilmember Kassan: THEN ONE


[Captioner] 20:26:39
OTHER QUESTION.


[Captioner] 20:26:42
I'M JUST WONDERING -- IT SEEMS LIKE


[Captioner] 20:26:44
THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A LOT OF 

[Captioner] 20:26:44
DEFERRED


[Captioner] 20:26:46
MAINTENANCE THAT LED TO THE POINT 

[Captioner] 20:26:46
WHERE


[Captioner] 20:26:48
WE HAVE A BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF


[Captioner] 20:26:50
PROJECTS, SOME OF WHICH IS, YOU KNOW,


[Captioner] 20:26:53
DEALING WITH THINGS THAT NEED TO BE


[Captioner] 20:26:55
URGENTLY REPAIRED AND REPLACED, AND 

[Captioner] 20:26:55
I'M


[Captioner] 20:26:58
JUST WONDERING HOW THAT HAPPENED, LIKE


[Captioner] 20:27:00
WHY DIDN'T WE HAVE ENOUGH OF A BUDGET 

[Captioner] 20:27:00
TO


[Captioner] 20:27:02
BE KIND OF TAKING CARE OF THESE THINGS


[Captioner] 20:27:04
ALONG THE WAY INSTEAD OF LETTING THEM


[Captioner] 20:27:07
GET TO THE POINT WHERE THEY WERE


[Captioner] 20:27:07
URGENTLY NEEDED TO BE ADDRESSED?


[Captioner] 20:27:14
>> Mr. Persselin: THAT'S A GOOD


[Captioner] 20:27:14
QUESTION.


[Captioner] 20:27:17
SO HISTORICALLY -- SO ONE OF THE 

[Captioner] 20:27:17
THINGS


[Captioner] 20:27:19
THAT HANS MENTIONED AS PART OF THE


[Captioner] 20:27:24
PRESENTATION IS THAT CURRENTLY WE'RE


[Captioner] 20:27:27
FUNDING AN AN YULE ONGOING TRANSFER 

[Captioner] 20:27:28
FROM


[Captioner] 20:27:31
THE GENERAL FUND FOR STREETS, 

[Captioner] 20:27:31
BUILDINGS


[Captioner] 20:27:34
AND PARK MAINTENANCE OF ABOUT $7 

[Captioner] 20:27:34
MILLION


[Captioner] 20:27:35
IN TOTAL AND THAT'S ONGOING.


[Captioner] 20:27:38
THAT'S NEW, THIS IS ACTUALLY THE FIRST


[Captioner] 20:27:40
YEAR THAT WE FUNDED AT THAT LEVEL.


[Captioner] 20:27:43
PRIOR TO THAT, WE BR WERE FUNDING AT


[Captioner] 20:27:45
$5 MILLION A YEAR, SO STILL 

[Captioner] 20:27:45
SUBSTANTIAL
AMOUNT.


[Captioner] 20:27:49
YOU MAY RECALL THAT WHEN WE DID OUR


[Captioner] 20:27:51
BUDGET BALANCING ACTIONS TO ADDRESS


[Captioner] 20:27:54
COVID, WE ACTUALLY SUSPENDED THOSE


[Captioner] 20:27:54
TRANSFERS FOR A YEAR.


[Captioner] 20:27:58
IF YOU GO BACK MORE THAN, YOU KNOW,


[Captioner] 20:28:02
MAYBE FIVE OR SIX YEARS, HISTORICALLY


[Captioner] 20:28:06
WHAT YOU'LL SEE IS THAT THE GENERAL 

[Captioner] 20:28:08
FUND


[Captioner] 20:28:10
HASN'T ACTUALLY HAD SUFFICIENT 

[Captioner] 20:28:10
RESOURCES


[Captioner] 20:28:14
TO MAKE SUFFICIENT CONTRIBUTIONS ON AN


[Captioner] 20:28:14
ANNUAL BASIS.


[Captioner] 20:28:16
SO THE $5 MILLION THAT WE HAVE BEEN


[Captioner] 20:28:23
DOING OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS WAS A


[Captioner] 20:28:24
PRETTY BIG STEP UP FROM WHAT WE HAD 

[Captioner] 20:28:25
BEEN


[Captioner] 20:28:26
RECEIVING HISTORICALLY AND DURING THE


[Captioner] 20:28:28
GREAT RECESSION, WE ACTUALLY DIALED IT


[Captioner] 20:28:28
BACK TO ZERO.


[Captioner] 20:28:31
SO IT'S ONE OF THOSE AREAS WHERE WHEN


[Captioner] 20:28:33
TIMES ARE GOOD, WE TRY TO PULT THE 

[Captioner] 20:28:34
MONEY


[Captioner] 20:28:36
IN, BUT WHEN TIMES ARE NOT SO GOOD, 

[Captioner] 20:28:37
THEN


[Captioner] 20:28:39
THIS IS ONE OF THE FIRST PLACES THAT 

[Captioner] 20:28:39
WE


[Captioner] 20:28:43
TEND TO REDUCE INVESTMENT, BUT THE


[Captioner] 20:28:47
DOWNSIDE TO THAT IS WHAT YOU'RE


[Captioner] 20:28:49
HIGHLIGHTING IS THAT WHEN YOU DEFER


[Captioner] 20:28:50
MAINTENANCE, YOU'RE NOT ONLY PUSHING 

[Captioner] 20:28:50
OFF


[Captioner] 20:28:52
THOSE DOLLARS, IT'S PROBABLY GETTING A


[Captioner] 20:28:52
LOT MORE EXPENSIVE.


[Captioner] 20:28:58
SO DEFERRED MAINTENANCE IS CLEARLY NOT


[Captioner] 20:28:59
AN IDEAL MODE OF OPERATION.


[Captioner] 20:29:07
>> Ms. Gauthier: VICE MAYOR KENG.


[Captioner] 20:29:10
>> Vice Mayor Keng: THANK YOU, SUSAN.


[Captioner] 20:29:12
SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE


[Captioner] 20:29:13
PRESENTATION AND THE DETAILS.


[Captioner] 20:29:15
AND THE PLANS.


[Captioner] 20:29:18
I JUST HAVE A FEW QUICK QUESTIONS.


[Captioner] 20:29:22
FIRST IS IS THERE ANY CONSIDERATION OR


[Captioner] 20:29:24
IN THE LONG TERM PLAN FOR A COMMUNITY


[Captioner] 20:29:26
CENTER ON THE NORTH SIDE OF TOWN?


[Captioner] 20:29:30
I KNOW THAT THAT'S ALSO A BIG CHUNK OF


[Captioner] 20:29:33
MONEY, BUT JUST WANT TO REITERATE THE


[Captioner] 20:29:33
NEED FOR IT.


[Captioner] 20:29:43
AND THEN IF YOU HAVE THE TIMELINE FOR


[Captioner] 20:29:50
THESE THREE ITEMS, THE LOOP TRAIL AT 

[Captioner] 20:29:50
THE


[Captioner] 20:29:54
SYLVESTER HARVEY PARK, AND THEN THE 

[Captioner] 20:29:54
DOG


[Captioner] 20:29:56
PARK AT THE PATTERSON RANCH PARK, AND


[Captioner] 20:30:01
THE PICKLEBALL COURTS THAT'S ALREADY 

[Captioner] 20:30:01
IN


[Captioner] 20:30:01
THE PLANS.


[Captioner] 20:30:02
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:30:12
>> THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION.


[Captioner] 20:30:14
JUST TO ANSWER THE SECOND 


[Captioner] 20:30:21
QUESTION, FIRST, THE -- THE 


[Captioner] 20:30:24
HARVEY LOOP TRAIL AND THE 


[Captioner] 20:30:25
NORTHGATE PLAYGROUND ARE 


[Captioner] 20:30:26
CURRENTLY UNDERWAY.


[Captioner] 20:30:27
THEY HAVE BIDS THAT ARE 


[Captioner] 20:30:28
CURRENTLY OUT.


[Captioner] 20:30:30
AND SO THOSE WILL BE GOING OUT 


[Captioner] 20:30:32
RIGHT NOW AND WE EXPECT THOSE TO 


[Captioner] 20:30:34
BE IMPLEMENTED IN SUMMER, EARLY 


[Captioner] 20:30:34
FALL.


[Captioner] 20:30:36
AND THEN FOR UPCOMING NEW 


[Captioner] 20:30:39
FUNDING, ONCE COUNCIL DETERMINES 


[Captioner] 20:30:40
WHAT THAT SHOULD BE, WILL BE 


[Captioner] 20:30:43
ADOPTED BY JULY 1st AND THEN 


[Captioner] 20:30:47
WE WILL BEGIN THE PROCESS OF 


[Captioner] 20:30:49
ADOPTING THE FUNDS THROUGH THE 


[Captioner] 20:30:51
PROCESS OF PRIORITIZATION AND 


[Captioner] 20:30:53
MAKE SURE WE GET THOSE ALLOCATED 


[Captioner] 20:30:54
WITHIN THE TWO-YEAR CYCLE.


[Captioner] 20:30:56
AND WE DO UNDERSTAND THE 


[Captioner] 20:31:05
PRIORITY NEED FOR ALL OF 


[Captioner] 20:31:06
COMMUNITY CENTERS AND THE MASTER 


[Captioner] 20:31:08
PLAN AS THE HIGHEST PRIORITY AND 


[Captioner] 20:31:10
WE DO RECKON THE NORTH SIDE THE 


[Captioner] 20:31:12
NEED FOR ADDITIONAL SPACE WHICH 


[Captioner] 20:31:14
IS WHY WE HAVE THE ROOFED ARBOR 


[Captioner] 20:31:16
GOING IN AT NORTHGATE AS WELL TO 


[Captioner] 20:31:17
PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL SPACE 


[Captioner] 20:31:19
THAT WE THINK WILL BE HAPPENING 


[Captioner] 20:31:20
ALSO THIS THIS NEXT YEAR.


[Captioner] 20:31:24
>> Vice Mayor Keng:   GREAT, 


[Captioner] 20:31:28
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:31:28
>> The Clerk:   COUNCILMEMBER 


[Captioner] 20:31:28
CAMPBELL.


[Captioner] 20:31:33
>> Councilmember Campbell:   


[Captioner] 20:31:34
THANK YOU FOR THIS PRESENTATION.


[Captioner] 20:31:36
I JUST HAVE A COUPLE OF 


[Captioner] 20:31:38
QUESTIONS BECAUSE I'M A LITTLE 


[Captioner] 20:31:39
CONFUSED ABOUT THE FUNDING.


[Captioner] 20:31:40
I GOT SEVERAL NUMBERS HERE.


[Captioner] 20:31:43
I HAVE $249 MILLION.


[Captioner] 20:31:45
WAS THAT JUST FOR THE -- JUST 


[Captioner] 20:31:50
THE BASE FOR THE FIVE YEAR PLAN?


[Captioner] 20:31:52
>> THAT'S CORRECT.


[Captioner] 20:31:52
>> Councilmember Campbell:   


[Captioner] 20:31:54
OKAY AND THEN I HAVE ANOTHER 


[Captioner] 20:31:56
ONE-TIME $58 MILLION, IS THAT 


[Captioner] 20:32:00
PART OF THE NEW --


[Captioner] 20:32:02
>> Hans Larsen:   THAT IS 


[Captioner] 20:32:06
INCLUDED WITHIN THE 249.


[Captioner] 20:32:06
>> Councilmember Campbell:   


[Captioner] 20:32:10
IT'S NOT EXTRA NOT ON TOP?


[Captioner] 20:32:11
>> Hans Larsen:   THAT'S 


[Captioner] 20:32:11
CORRECT.


[Captioner] 20:32:11
>> Councilmember Campbell:   I 


[Captioner] 20:32:14
HAVE THE 7 MILLION OVER THE FIVE 


[Captioner] 20:32:16
YEARS, 35 MILLION, IS THAT PART 


[Captioner] 20:32:18
OF THE 249?


[Captioner] 20:32:19
>> Hans Larsen:   YES,.


[Captioner] 20:32:19
>> Councilmember Campbell:   


[Captioner] 20:32:20
OKAY, GREAT.


[Captioner] 20:32:29
SO GIVEN THAT, THE OTHER 50 OR 


[Captioner] 20:32:32
60 FOR YOUR FIRST HIGHEST 


[Captioner] 20:32:33
PRIORITY PROJECTS WOULD BE ADDED 


[Captioner] 20:32:38
TO THIS 249?


[Captioner] 20:32:39
>> Hans Larsen:   NO, I THINK 


[Captioner] 20:32:42
WHAT WE'RE -- KIND OF THE INTENT 


[Captioner] 20:32:44
OF THE PRESENTATION WAS FOR THE 


[Captioner] 20:32:48
UNALLOCATED $58 MILLION OF 


[Captioner] 20:32:50
GENERAL FUND TRANSFERS, THIS IS 


[Captioner] 20:32:52
KIND OF STAFF'S ADVICE ON WHAT 


[Captioner] 20:32:55
WE THINK ARE THE CITY'S URGENT 


[Captioner] 20:32:56
PRIORITIES.


[Captioner] 20:32:58
SO WE'RE KIND OF -- WE'RE KIND 


[Captioner] 20:33:00
OF THROWING OUT A PROPOSAL ON 


[Captioner] 20:33:01
HOW THOSE WOULD GET ALLOCATED.


[Captioner] 20:33:03
AND IT WOULD BE TOWARDS THOSE 


[Captioner] 20:33:05
ITEMS.


[Captioner] 20:33:06
>> Councilmember Campbell:   I 


[Captioner] 20:33:08
SEE, OKAY, SO THE 58 IS WHAT YOU 


[Captioner] 20:33:13
ARE LOOKING AT FOR THE URGENT 


[Captioner] 20:33:15
$50 MILLION PRIORITIES THAT YOU 


[Captioner] 20:33:16
SPOKE ABOUT?


[Captioner] 20:33:18
>> Hans Larsen:   YEAH, AND I 


[Captioner] 20:33:29
THINK THAT GROUPING OF 50 TO 


[Captioner] 20:33:32
700, GENERALLY REPRESENTS 


[Captioner] 20:33:35
THOSE -- THE URGENT NUMBERS IS 


[Captioner] 20:33:36
THE 58.


[Captioner] 20:33:36
>> Councilmember Campbell:   IT 


[Captioner] 20:33:39
REPRESENTS THE MOST URGENT NEEDS 


[Captioner] 20:33:40
YOU SEE THROUGHOUT THE CITY?


[Captioner] 20:33:41
>> Hans Larsen:   THAT'S 


[Captioner] 20:33:42
CORRECT.


[Captioner] 20:33:43
>> Councilmember Campbell:   AND 


[Captioner] 20:33:44
THEN THERE WAS A LOT OF TALK 


[Captioner] 20:33:46
ABOUT NEW PARKS, NEW RECREATION 


[Captioner] 20:33:47
CENTERS.


[Captioner] 20:33:49
WHAT IS THE FUNDING SOURCE 


[Captioner] 20:33:50
FOR -- BECAUSE I'M THINKING 


[Captioner] 20:33:52
ABOUT SUSTAINABILITY AND 


[Captioner] 20:33:54
MAINTENANCE.


[Captioner] 20:33:57
AND DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND 


[Captioner] 20:33:59
SOME OF THOSE OTHER THINGS.


[Captioner] 20:34:01
WHERE DO WE FORESEE FUNDING 


[Captioner] 20:34:03
COMING FOR THAT PARTICULAR 


[Captioner] 20:34:06
CATEGORY OF SUSTAINABILITY?


[Captioner] 20:34:09
>> SO DEPENDING ON THE PARK, I'M 


[Captioner] 20:34:11
SORRY, DEPENDING ON THE PARK AND 


[Captioner] 20:34:15
THE PARK TYPE, IN SOME CASES 


[Captioner] 20:34:17
WE'RE REDEVELOPING SOME OF THE 


[Captioner] 20:34:17
PARK SITES.


[Captioner] 20:34:19
IN OTHER CASES WE'RE ADDING NEW 


[Captioner] 20:34:22
PARK AREAS TO INCREASE OUR PARK 


[Captioner] 20:34:23
LAND OVERALL.


[Captioner] 20:34:25
ONE OF THE GOALS IS TO KEEP FIVE 


[Captioner] 20:34:27
ACRES PER THOUSAND RESIDENTS, IN 


[Captioner] 20:34:31
ORDER TO KEEP A HEALTHY, ACTIVE 


[Captioner] 20:34:33
RESIDENTS ACROSS THE ENTIRE CITY 


[Captioner] 20:34:34
SPECTRUM.


[Captioner] 20:34:35
AND IN ORDER TO DO THAT WE NEED 


[Captioner] 20:34:37
TO BE DEVELOPING PARK LAND 


[Captioner] 20:34:38
ACCORDINGLY.


[Captioner] 20:34:40
IN SOME AREAS AS OUR MASTER PLAN 


[Captioner] 20:34:42
SHOWED WE HAD SOME AREAS THAT 


[Captioner] 20:34:43
DON'T HAVE TEN MINUTE WALKS AND 


[Captioner] 20:34:46
SO WE STILL NEED TO ACQUIRE LAND 


[Captioner] 20:34:48
EVEN THOUGH WE MAY NOT BE 


[Captioner] 20:34:49
DEVELOPING IT FOR TEN TO 20 


[Captioner] 20:34:53
YEARS AS DUSTERBERRY PARK 


[Captioner] 20:34:55
SHOWED, WE NEED TO HOLD THAT 


[Captioner] 20:34:57
LAND FOR FUTURE PARK 


[Captioner] 20:34:57
DEVELOPMENT.


[Captioner] 20:34:59
IN OTHER CASES WE ARE INTENDING 


[Captioner] 20:35:01
TO HAVE MAINTENANCE MONEY SET 


[Captioner] 20:35:03
ASIDE AS WE DO WITH PACIFIC 


[Captioner] 20:35:04
COMMONS, WE HAVE MAINTENANCE 


[Captioner] 20:35:05
MONEY SET ASIDE FOR THAT 


[Captioner] 20:35:06
SPECIFICALLY.


[Captioner] 20:35:08
AND IF WE DON'T HAVE FUNDING SET 


[Captioner] 20:35:10
ASIDE THEN WE'RE GOING TO WORK 


[Captioner] 20:35:11
VERY HARD TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO 


[Captioner] 20:35:14
DO IT BEFORE WE BRING A PROPOSAL 


[Captioner] 20:35:16
IN FRONT OF COUNCIL.


[Captioner] 20:35:16
>> Councilmember Campbell:   


[Captioner] 20:35:28
MENTI


[Captioner] 20:35:30
ONING LAND ACQUISITION, IS THAT 


[Captioner] 20:35:32
FUNDING OR CASH?


[Captioner] 20:35:35
>> WE HAVE FUNDING PARTICULARLY 


[Captioner] 20:35:36
FOR QUALIFICATION.


[Captioner] 20:35:39
 ACQUISITION.


[Captioner] 20:35:45
UNTIL WE FOCUS OUR ACQUISITION 


[Captioner] 20:35:46
TOWARDS.


[Captioner] 20:35:49
IN CERTAIN AREAS WE KNOW WE ARE 


[Captioner] 20:35:53
IN DEFICIT OF THE ABILITY TO 


[Captioner] 20:35:55
WALK TO A NEIGHBORHOOD PARK WE 


[Captioner] 20:36:00
ARE LOOKING TO IDENTIFY NEW LAND 


[Captioner] 20:36:03
ACQUISITION, ALL DIFFERENT TYPES 


[Captioner] 20:36:06
OF ACQUISITION, WE DON'T HAVE 


[Captioner] 20:36:08
ANY LAND ACQUISITION PROPOSALS 


[Captioner] 20:36:12
IN THIS PRESENTATION.


[Captioner] 20:36:16
>> Councilmember Campbell:   


[Captioner] 20:36:19
$250,000 IS NOT ENOUGH TO BUY 


[Captioner] 20:36:21
LAND BECAUSE IF IT IS, I WANT TO 


[Captioner] 20:36:22
BUY SOME.


[Captioner] 20:36:23
>> IT'S NOT IN THIS PROPOSAL.


[Captioner] 20:36:25
>> Councilmember Campbell:   MY 


[Captioner] 20:36:27
LAST QUESTION HAS TO DO WITH -- 


[Captioner] 20:36:30
OH, I GOT A LOT OF COMPLAINTS 


[Captioner] 20:36:32
ABOUT THE TREES AND THE 


[Captioner] 20:36:33
SIDEWALKS.


[Captioner] 20:36:36
AND IS THIS 50-50, DOES THAT 


[Captioner] 20:36:38
MEAN THAT THE HOMEOWNER PAYS 50 


[Captioner] 20:36:41
AND THE CITY PAYS THE OTHER 


[Captioner] 20:36:43
CITY, IS THAT -- THAT'S 


[Captioner] 20:36:45
GENERALLY HOW IT WORKS?


[Captioner] 20:36:50
AND DOES THE CITY ACTUALLY HIRE 


[Captioner] 20:36:51
THE STROARND DO ALL OF THE WORK 


[Captioner] 20:36:53
OR DOES THE HOMEOWNER HAVE TO DO 


[Captioner] 20:36:55
THAT?


[Captioner] 20:36:57
I'M NOT SURE HOW IT WORKS.


[Captioner] 20:36:59
>> SO WE CAN PROVIDE YOU SOME 


[Captioner] 20:37:01
INFORMATION ABOUT IT IN DETAIL.


[Captioner] 20:37:02
BECAUSE IT IS A GOOD PROGRAM TO 


[Captioner] 20:37:04
SHARE WITH THE COMMUNITY.


[Captioner] 20:37:04
>> Councilmember Campbell:   


[Captioner] 20:37:06
YES, BECAUSE I DID GET A LOT OF 


[Captioner] 20:37:07
COMPLAINTS ABOUT THAT.


[Captioner] 20:37:09
>> AND TODAY IS A PARTICULARLY 


[Captioner] 20:37:11
DIFFICULT DAY OUT IN THE 


[Captioner] 20:37:12
COMMUNITY AND WE UNDERSTAND 


[Captioner] 20:37:12
THAT.


[Captioner] 20:37:12
>> Councilmember Campbell:   YES 


[Captioner] 20:37:14
IT HAS BEEN.


[Captioner] 20:37:15
>> THERE IS A PROGRAM WE HAVE 


[Captioner] 20:37:17
CALLED A 50-50 PROGRAM AND A 


[Captioner] 20:37:19
RESIDENT CAN RECEIVE UP TO $750 


[Captioner] 20:37:21
AND THEN THEY WOULD MATCH THAT 


[Captioner] 20:37:23
IN ORDER TO TRIM AND MAINTAIN 


[Captioner] 20:37:24
THEIR TREE.


[Captioner] 20:37:25
THAT WOULD BE THEIR PRIVATE TREE 


[Captioner] 20:37:27
IN TRONT OF THEIR HOME.


[Captioner] 20:37:28
AND WE WOULD WORK WITH THEM TO 


[Captioner] 20:37:30
MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE A 


[Captioner] 20:37:31
CONTRACTOR THAT'S BEEN APPROVED 


[Captioner] 20:37:34
BY THE CITY SO IT'S NOT SOMEBODY 


[Captioner] 20:37:37
THAT'S TOPPING THEIR TREE OR 


[Captioner] 20:37:39
DOING SOMETHING THAT'S UNHEALTHY 


[Captioner] 20:37:40
FOR THEIR TREES.


[Captioner] 20:37:44
AND WE WITH MAKE SURE IT WAS AN 


[Captioner] 20:37:46
APPROVED CONTRACTOR THAT DOES A 


[Captioner] 20:37:47
GREAT WORK IN THE COMMUNITY, 


[Captioner] 20:37:49
TRIM THEIR TREES EFFECTIVELY 


[Captioner] 20:37:51
MAINTAINING IT IN OUR COMMUNITY.


[Captioner] 20:37:52
>> Councilmember Campbell:   I 


[Captioner] 20:37:54
WAS SPECIFICALLY ASKING ABOUT 


[Captioner] 20:37:55
THE TREES AS IT IMPACTS THE 


[Captioner] 20:37:56
SIDEWALK.


[Captioner] 20:38:01
NOT NECESSARILY TREE-TRIMMING.


[Captioner] 20:38:02
>> THERE'S BOTH TREE AND 


[Captioner] 20:38:04
SIDEWALK, 50-50 PROGRAMS.


[Captioner] 20:38:05
>> Councilmember Campbell:   I 


[Captioner] 20:38:06
SEE, OKAY, THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:38:15
>> The Clerk:   COUNCILMEMBER 


[Captioner] 20:38:16
COX.


[Captioner] 20:38:16
>> Councilmember Cox:   THANK 


[Captioner] 20:38:17
YOU.


[Captioner] 20:38:18
I REALLY ENJOYED THE 


[Captioner] 20:38:20
PRESENTATION AND THE DETAILS, 


[Captioner] 20:38:20
THANK YOU SO MUCH.


[Captioner] 20:38:22
I SEE THAT WHEN I'M LOOKING TO 


[Captioner] 20:38:24
SET A PRIORITY ON PROJECTS, FOR 


[Captioner] 20:38:26
ME PERSONALLY AND JUST KIND OF 


[Captioner] 20:38:27
THINKING THROUGH IT, I'M 


[Captioner] 20:38:29
THINKING LIKE HEALTH AND SAFETY 


[Captioner] 20:38:31
COME AT THE TOP OF THE LIST.


[Captioner] 20:38:34
AND I SEE THAT A MAJORITY OF 


[Captioner] 20:38:35
THESE ITEMS ARE.


[Captioner] 20:38:37
AND ONE OF THE ONES THAT I 


[Captioner] 20:38:39
NEEDED A LITTLE BIT MORE 


[Captioner] 20:38:43
CLARIFICATION ON WAS ON THE CITY 


[Captioner] 20:38:46
FLEET ELECTRICAL VEHICLE 


[Captioner] 20:38:48
CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE AND 


[Captioner] 20:38:49
TRYING TO UNDERSTAND A LITTLE 


[Captioner] 20:38:52
BIT MORE ABOUT THAT, IF WE ARE 


[Captioner] 20:38:56
SHORT ON PORTS AND CHARGING 


[Captioner] 20:39:04
STATIONS, OR ARE WE -- IS IT 


[Captioner] 20:39:06
THAT THEY ARE WEARING OUT AND WE 


[Captioner] 20:39:08
NEED TO REPLACE THEM?


[Captioner] 20:39:09
IF YOU COULD PROVIDE A LITTLE 


[Captioner] 20:39:11
MORE DETAIL THAT WOULD BE MOST 


[Captioner] 20:39:12
HELPFUL.


[Captioner] 20:39:13
>> Hans Larsen:   THANK YOU, 


[Captioner] 20:39:14
COUNCILMEMBER COX.


[Captioner] 20:39:16
SO YOU HAVE THE -- THE CITY HAS 


[Captioner] 20:39:17
A VEHICLE REPLACEMENT PROGRAM.


[Captioner] 20:39:21
SO WHEN VEHICLES GET OLD, 


[Captioner] 20:39:22
THERE'S MONEYS THAT ARE 


[Captioner] 20:39:24
ALLOCATED IN THE CURRENT GENERAL 


[Captioner] 20:39:26
FUND TO REPLACE THEM, YOU KNOW, 


[Captioner] 20:39:28
WHEN THEY'RE AT THE END OF THEIR 


[Captioner] 20:39:29
USEFUL LIFE.


[Captioner] 20:39:32
SO WE CAN ACTUALLY BUY ELECTRIC 


[Captioner] 20:39:36
VEHICLES TO REPLACE OUR FLEET.


[Captioner] 20:39:40
BUT OUR CRITICAL PATH IS HAVING 


[Captioner] 20:39:43
THE ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING 


[Captioner] 20:39:45
INFRASTRUCTURE AT THE VARIOUS 


[Captioner] 20:39:46
FACILITIES WHERE OUR VEHICLES 


[Captioner] 20:39:48
ARE LOCATED.


[Captioner] 20:39:50
AND THE TWO MAIN LOCATIONS WHERE 


[Captioner] 20:39:52
MOST OF OUR VEHICLES ARE AT ARE 


[Captioner] 20:39:55
AT THE POLICE CENTER AND OUR 


[Captioner] 20:39:57
MAINTENANCE CENTER.


[Captioner] 20:39:58
AND ONE OF THE PARTICULAR 


[Captioner] 20:40:01
CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE IS THAT 


[Captioner] 20:40:02
WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH POWER 


[Captioner] 20:40:05
SUPPLY AT THOSE FACILITIES TO 


[Captioner] 20:40:07
RUN THE CHARGERS.


[Captioner] 20:40:10
AND SO IT IS -- YOU KNOW, IT IS 


[Captioner] 20:40:12
NOT KIND OF AN EASY PROJECT TO 


[Captioner] 20:40:14
SORT OF BRING IN THE POWER OR 


[Captioner] 20:40:19
THE TYPE OF CHARGERS THAT CAN 


[Captioner] 20:40:21
PROVIDE EV CHARGING WITHOUT 


[Captioner] 20:40:23
CREATING A BIG DEMAND ON SORT OF 


[Captioner] 20:40:25
THE POWER SUPPLY TO OUR 


[Captioner] 20:40:26
FACILITIES.


[Captioner] 20:40:28
SO WHAT WE'RE RECOMMENDING, YOU 


[Captioner] 20:40:30
KNOW, IT IS ON OUR URGENT 


[Captioner] 20:40:31
PRIORITY LIST IS AN ALLOCATION 


[Captioner] 20:40:34
FOR A FIVE-YEAR PROGRAM OF $5 


[Captioner] 20:40:38
MILLION TO SUPPORT PROVIDING EV 


[Captioner] 20:40:41
CHARGERS AT OUR MAJOR 


[Captioner] 20:40:43
FACILITIES, SO THAT WE CAN 


[Captioner] 20:40:46
CONTINUE TO PURCHASE ELECTRIC 


[Captioner] 20:40:49
VEHICLES AS OUR VEHICLES AGE.


[Captioner] 20:40:52
WE DID DO A PROJECT THAT WAS 


[Captioner] 20:40:55
JUST COMPLETED WHERE WE ADDED 


[Captioner] 20:40:57
FIVE NEW CHARGING PORTS AT THE 


[Captioner] 20:40:59
POLICE CENTER.


[Captioner] 20:41:01
SO TAKING THEM FROM SIX TO 11.


[Captioner] 20:41:04
AND SO THAT COVERS A VERY 


[Captioner] 20:41:07
SHORT-TERM NEED.


[Captioner] 20:41:09
BUT WE'RE LOOKING AT REPLACING 


[Captioner] 20:41:12
20, 30 VEHICLES A YEAR, 


[Captioner] 20:41:14
BEGINNING NEXT YEAR, AND WE'D 


[Captioner] 20:41:17
LIKE FOR MOST OF THEM TO BE EV'S 


[Captioner] 20:41:20
AND SO THERE IS SOME URGENCY IN 


[Captioner] 20:41:21
HAVING THE CHARGING 


[Captioner] 20:41:22
INFRASTRUCTURE KEEP UP WITH THE 


[Captioner] 20:41:24
CYCLE FOR VEHICLE REPLACEMENT.


[Captioner] 20:41:26
AND TO COMPLY WITH THE STATE 


[Captioner] 20:41:30
MANDATES OPEN THIS TOPIC.


[Captioner] 20:41:31
>> Councilmember Cox:   RIOT, 


[Captioner] 20:41:31
EXACTLY.


[Captioner] 20:41:34
I WAS JUST THINKING OUT -- 


[Captioner] 20:41:35
RIGHT, EXACTLY.


[Captioner] 20:41:38
I WAS JUST THINKING OUT LOUD 


[Captioner] 20:41:39
THAT MAYBE CHECKING IN ON OTHER 


[Captioner] 20:41:41
CITIES OR COUNTIES THAT MAY HAVE 


[Captioner] 20:41:43
PROCUREMENTS THAT YOU CAN 


[Captioner] 20:41:46
PIGGYBACK OFF OF AND GET BETTER 


[Captioner] 20:41:48
PRICING THAN US GOING OUT ON A 


[Captioner] 20:41:50
SOLICITATION, COMPETITIVE 


[Captioner] 20:41:51
SOLICITATION ON OUR OWN.


[Captioner] 20:41:53
BECAUSE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT 


[Captioner] 20:41:56
YOU'RE LISTING HERE ARE QUITE 


[Captioner] 20:41:58
PREVALENT THROUGHOUT THE 


[Captioner] 20:42:01
DIFFERENT COUNTIES OF DOING ALL 


[Captioner] 20:42:04
KINDS OF ROOF REPLACEMENTS, TO 


[Captioner] 20:42:07
THE EV CHARGING STATIONS, AND 


[Captioner] 20:42:11
BATHROOMS, I JUST MOVED INTO A 


[Captioner] 20:42:13
BRAND-NEW BUILDING AND I KNOW 


[Captioner] 20:42:17
EXACTLY ABOUT THE WAVING OF THE 


[Captioner] 20:42:19
HAND TO GO INTO THE BATHROOMS 


[Captioner] 20:42:21
AND NO TOUCHING OF ANYTHING FROM 


[Captioner] 20:42:23
THE TOILETS TO THE SINGERS AND 


[Captioner] 20:42:25
ALL OF THAT SO THE MODERNIZATION 


[Captioner] 20:42:28
IS VERY IMPORTANT.


[Captioner] 20:42:30
BUT ALSO IT IS A HEALTH -- 


[Captioner] 20:42:32
PROTECTING THE HEALTH FROM THE 


[Captioner] 20:42:33
DIFFERENT GERMS AND BACTERIA 


[Captioner] 20:42:37
THAT WE DON'T GET EXPOSED TO BY 


[Captioner] 20:42:38
HAVING TO TOUCH THOSE ITEMS.


[Captioner] 20:42:40
THOSE ARE TO ME HEALTH AND 


[Captioner] 20:42:42
SAFETY BENEFITS THAT DO REQUIRE 


[Captioner] 20:42:45
SOME SORT OF INVESTMENT.


[Captioner] 20:42:47
AND EVEN LIKE THE FIRE ALERT 


[Captioner] 20:42:51
SYSTEMS LIKE RUN BY CONVERGENT 


[Captioner] 20:42:54
OR JB JOHNSON CONTROLS THERE IS 


[Captioner] 20:42:56
A LOT OF PIGGYBACKING OFF OF THE 


[Captioner] 20:42:58
SOURCING SOURCE WELL COOPERATIVE 


[Captioner] 20:43:00
AGREEMENTS THAT CAN BE TAPPED 


[Captioner] 20:43:02
IN, TO BE ABLE TO BRING THE 


[Captioner] 20:43:03
PRICE DOWN.


[Captioner] 20:43:05
OR PIGGYBACKING OFF OF EXISTING 


[Captioner] 20:43:06
AGREEMENTS WITH THE DIFFERENT 


[Captioner] 20:43:08
COUNTIES AROUND.


[Captioner] 20:43:10
BUT, YOU KNOW, I JUST THOUGHT 


[Captioner] 20:43:11
I'D JUST MENTION THAT TO KIND OF 


[Captioner] 20:43:13
HELP, AS ANOTHER -- I KNOW YOU 


[Captioner] 20:43:16
GUYS ARE VERY GOOD ABOUT FINDING 


[Captioner] 20:43:18
MONEY EVERYWHERE, GRANTS, 


[Captioner] 20:43:21
SOURCES, ANY SPECIAL SITUATIONS, 


[Captioner] 20:43:22
YOU'RE GREAT ABOUT ALL OF THAT 


[Captioner] 20:43:24
BUT THE OTHER PART IS JUST I 


[Captioner] 20:43:25
THOUGHT I'D JUST MENTION THAT 


[Captioner] 20:43:27
THERE'S SOME OTHER RESOURCING 


[Captioner] 20:43:29
AND LOOKING AT SOME OTHER 


[Captioner] 20:43:31
SOURCING OPPORTUNITIES TO HELP 


[Captioner] 20:43:33
TAKE THE PRICE DOWN, IF WE 


[Captioner] 20:43:36
HAVE -- IF WE CAN'T FIND THE 


[Captioner] 20:43:36
GRANTS.


[Captioner] 20:43:38
AND THAT WOULD BE OUR OTHER LAST 


[Captioner] 20:43:38
RESORT.


[Captioner] 20:43:40
BUT I JUST THOUGHT THAT -- I 


[Captioner] 20:43:42
THINK THE LIST IS VERY GOOD.


[Captioner] 20:43:44
AND I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT.


[Captioner] 20:43:46
AND AS THE BUILDINGS AGE IT COST 


[Captioner] 20:43:49
A LOT MORE MONEY TO MAINTAIN 


[Captioner] 20:43:50
EACH YEAR.


[Captioner] 20:43:51
AND NOW WE'RE HIT IN THE MIDDLE 


[Captioner] 20:43:54
OF A LOT OF THINGS WITH, AS YOU 


[Captioner] 20:43:57
MENTIONED, THE COST OF MATERIALS 


[Captioner] 20:43:59
AND THE COST OF GAS AND 


[Captioner] 20:44:00
EVERYTHING ADDING INTO IT.


[Captioner] 20:44:02
AND THERE'S A LOT OF SURCHARGES 


[Captioner] 20:44:04
AS WE KNOW OUT THERE THAT ARE 


[Captioner] 20:44:06
BEING SPREAD ON EVERY SINGLE 


[Captioner] 20:44:09
THING THAT YOU DO AS A SERVICE 


[Captioner] 20:44:12
CURRENTLY IN THE MARKET.


[Captioner] 20:44:14
SO I REALLY THINK THAT THE LIST 


[Captioner] 20:44:16
THAT YOU HAVE DOES SET A HIGH 


[Captioner] 20:44:19
PRIORITY OF HEALTH AND SAFETY, 


[Captioner] 20:44:21
AND TO ME THOSE ARE THE MOST 


[Captioner] 20:44:23
IMPORTANT THINGS THAT ANYBODY 


[Captioner] 20:44:26
LOOKING AT IT, THAT WOULD BE -- 


[Captioner] 20:44:27
I WOULD BE IN AGREEMENT WITH 


[Captioner] 20:44:31
YOUR URGENT PRIORITIES RIGHT 


[Captioner] 20:44:33
NOW.


[Captioner] 20:44:34
>> Hans Larsen:   GREAT, THANKS 


[Captioner] 20:44:35
FOR THE INPUT.


[Captioner] 20:44:38
I JUST WANT TO NOTE, THE 


[Captioner] 20:44:39
COOPERATIVE PURCHASING PROCESS 


[Captioner] 20:44:40
IS SOMETHING THAT WE DO USE AND 


[Captioner] 20:44:42
WE RECENTLY BECAME AWARE THAT 


[Captioner] 20:44:44
THERE ARE PRODUCTS FOR ELECTRIC 


[Captioner] 20:44:45
VEHICLE CHARGING THAT ARE 


[Captioner] 20:44:48
AVAILABLE THROUGH THE NETWORK OF 


[Captioner] 20:44:49
COOPERATIVE PURCHASES.


[Captioner] 20:44:50
SO YES.


[Captioner] 20:44:51
THANKS.


[Captioner] 20:44:52
FOR POINTING THAT OUT.


[Captioner] 20:44:53
>> Councilmember Cox:   


[Captioner] 20:44:53
ABSOLUTELY.


[Captioner] 20:44:55
I'LL BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO SHARE 


[Captioner] 20:44:56
RESOURCES IF YOU NEED ANY 


[Captioner] 20:44:59
THROUGH OUR CITY MANAGER.


[Captioner] 20:45:01
WHERE TO GO TO ON SOME OF THOSE 


[Captioner] 20:45:01
THINGS.


[Captioner] 20:45:03
BECAUSE I KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE 


[Captioner] 20:45:04
ARE SHOPPING THE SAME YOU WAY AS 


[Captioner] 20:45:05
WELL.


[Captioner] 20:45:09
>> Hans Larsen:   THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:45:09
>> Councilmember Cox:   YOU'RE 


[Captioner] 20:45:12
WELCOME.


[Captioner] 20:45:14
>> The Clerk:   COUNCILMEMBER 


[Captioner] 20:45:16
SALWAN FOLLOWED BY COUNCILMEMBER 


[Captioner] 20:45:18
KASSAN.


[Captioner] 20:45:19
>> Councilmember Salwan:   JUST 


[Captioner] 20:45:21
ONE SPECIFIC QUESTION, THE 


[Captioner] 20:45:22
PACIFIC COMMONS 40 ACRE PARKS, 


[Captioner] 20:45:25
THAT WAS NOT SPECIFICALLY 


[Captioner] 20:45:26
MENTIONED BUT WHAT IS THE 


[Captioner] 20:45:27
THOUGHT ABOUT THAT, IT WAS 


[Captioner] 20:45:29
MENTIONED IN PASSING THE 


[Captioner] 20:45:31
DIFFERENT WAYS TO USE IT.


[Captioner] 20:45:32
>> THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION.


[Captioner] 20:45:33
WE ACTUALLY HAVE A SIGNIFICANT 


[Captioner] 20:45:35
INTEREST IN THE TRAIL MOVING 


[Captioner] 20:45:36
FORWARD AND PREPARING THAT SITE 


[Captioner] 20:45:37
FOR FUTURE PARTNERSHIP 


[Captioner] 20:45:38
OPPORTUNITIES.


[Captioner] 20:45:40
AND THAT'S WHY WE COULD DEFUND 


[Captioner] 20:45:42
IT AT THE SAME TIME PREPARE FOR 


[Captioner] 20:45:43
A PROJECT THERE, AS WELL.


[Captioner] 20:45:46
SO THE IDEA THAT WE CAN PREPARE 


[Captioner] 20:45:48
PICKLEBALL COURT THERE AND ALSO 


[Captioner] 20:45:50
THINK ABOUT A TRAIL SYSTEM AND 


[Captioner] 20:45:52
THE BASIC INFRASTRUCTURE AT THAT 


[Captioner] 20:45:54
SITE WE KNOW WE HAVE FUNDING FOR 


[Captioner] 20:45:55
AND MAINTENANCE FOR.


[Captioner] 20:45:56
BUT WE ARE NOT READY TO MOVE 


[Captioner] 20:45:58
FORWARD WITH A SPORTS REGIONAL 


[Captioner] 20:46:00
PARK THERE UNTIL WE HAVE A 


[Captioner] 20:46:04
COMMITTED PARTNER IN THE PUBLIC, 


[Captioner] 20:46:06
PRIVATE OR NONPROFIT WORLD.


[Captioner] 20:46:06
>> Councilmember Salwan:   WHEN 


[Captioner] 20:46:08
YOU SAY PARTNERSHIP IS THAT 


[Captioner] 20:46:09
SOMEBODY TO OPERATE IT OR 


[Captioner] 20:46:11
SOMEBODY TO USE IT OR --


[Captioner] 20:46:13
>> YEAH, IT COULD BE A VARIETY 


[Captioner] 20:46:14
OF WAYS IN WHICH WE CREATE 


[Captioner] 20:46:15
PARTNERSHIPS.


[Captioner] 20:46:17
I'VE SEEN IT DONE WITH SCHOOL 


[Captioner] 20:46:19
DISTRICT PARTNERSHIPS, I'VE SEEN 


[Captioner] 20:46:21
IT DONE WITH PRIVATE ENTITIES, 


[Captioner] 20:46:23
I'VE SEEN IT DONE WITH NONPROFIT 


[Captioner] 20:46:25
GROUPS THAT ARE REALLY 


[Captioner] 20:46:27
INTERESTED IN A SPECIFIC SPORT.


[Captioner] 20:46:29
THERE ARE LOTS OF WAYS OF 


[Captioner] 20:46:30
ACHIEVING THAT.


[Captioner] 20:46:33
WE KNOW WE HAVE A CREATIVE 


[Captioner] 20:46:35
COMMUNITY ESPECIALLY RELATED TO 


[Captioner] 20:46:37
GROUPS WE'VE SEEN COMING TO 


[Captioner] 20:46:39
COUNCIL, CONTRADICT, SOCCER, A 


[Captioner] 20:46:40
LOT OF GROUPS THAT ARE 


[Captioner] 20:46:43
INTERESTED IN PARTNERING WITH US 


[Captioner] 20:46:44
ON THAT SPACE.


[Captioner] 20:46:44
>> Councilmember Salwan:   WE 


[Captioner] 20:46:46
HAVE A CREATIVE COMMUNITY 


[Captioner] 20:46:48
SERVICES DIRECTOR AS WELL.


[Captioner] 20:46:50
ANOTHER WAS THE PALM AVENUE 


[Captioner] 20:46:52
PARK, THAT WAS SOMETHING IN THE 


[Captioner] 20:46:54
WORKS THAT WE HAD DEDICATED 


[Captioner] 20:46:57
FUNDING AT SOME POINT.


[Captioner] 20:46:59
IS THAT STILT IN THE PIPELINE OR 


[Captioner] 20:47:01
WHAT IS THE PROGRESS ON THAT?


[Captioner] 20:47:04
>> I'M GOING TO GET BACK TO YOU 


[Captioner] 20:47:08
ON THAT, BUT AT THE END OF THE 


[Captioner] 20:47:10
FIVE YEARS BEGINNING PALM 


[Captioner] 20:47:12
AFTERNOON FUNDING.


[Captioner] 20:47:16
THE FUNDING WE WOULD NEED WOULD 


[Captioner] 20:47:17
BEGIN THE FIVE YEAR PROCESS AND 


[Captioner] 20:47:20
I WILL CONFIRM THAT AT THE END 


[Captioner] 20:47:20
OF THE MEETING.


[Captioner] 20:47:21
>> Councilmember Salwan:   I 


[Captioner] 20:47:23
HAVE COMMENTS LATER BUT THAT'S 


[Captioner] 20:47:24
THE END FOR QUESTIONS.


[Captioner] 20:47:28
>> The Clerk:   COUNCILMEMBER 


[Captioner] 20:47:30
KASSAN.


[Captioner] 20:47:31
>> Councilmember Kassan:   THAT 


[Captioner] 20:47:33
WAS MY COMMENT, ARE WE ON 


[Captioner] 20:47:34
COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS?


[Captioner] 20:47:36
I THOUGHT WE WERE STILL ON JUST 


[Captioner] 20:47:36
QUESTIONS.


[Captioner] 20:47:37
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:47:40
>> The Clerk:   BACK TO MAYOR 


[Captioner] 20:47:42
MEI IF THERE ARE NO OTHER 


[Captioner] 20:47:44
SPEAKERS FROM THE COUNCIL.


[Captioner] 20:47:47
FTC SORRY, COUNCILMEMBER COX DID 


[Captioner] 20:47:54
SORRY, COUNCILMEMBER COX DID YOU 


[Captioner] 20:47:56
JUST PRESS NOW?


[Captioner] 20:47:59
YOU NEED YOUR MIC TURNED ON.


[Captioner] 20:48:00
>> Councilmember Cox:   CAN YOU 


[Captioner] 20:48:01
HEAR ME NOW?


[Captioner] 20:48:02
I JUST REMEMBERED, I REMEMBER 


[Captioner] 20:48:04
GETTING AN E-MAIL AND SOMEBODY 


[Captioner] 20:48:05
WAS ASKING ME ABOUT THE STATUS 


[Captioner] 20:48:10
ON THE BASKETBALL COURTS FOR THE 


[Captioner] 20:48:11
RIX PARK.


[Captioner] 20:48:13
AND THEY NOTICED THERE WAS A LOT 


[Captioner] 20:48:14
OF CONCRETE AROUND.


[Captioner] 20:48:15
AND THEY WANTED TO GET A STATUS 


[Captioner] 20:48:17
ON WHEN THAT PROJECT WOULD BE 


[Captioner] 20:48:17
COMPLETED.


[Captioner] 20:48:23
>> THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION.


[Captioner] 20:48:25
RIX PARK IS CURRENTLY UNDERWAY.


[Captioner] 20:48:29
AND IT IS OUT FOR CONTRACT RIGHT 


[Captioner] 20:48:29
NOW.


[Captioner] 20:48:31
AND SO IT SHOULD BE UNDER 


[Captioner] 20:48:32
CONSTRUCTION ANY DAY NOW.


[Captioner] 20:48:36
AND SO WE ARE READY TO SEE THAT 


[Captioner] 20:48:37
CONSTRUCTION CREW OUT THERE AS 


[Captioner] 20:48:38
SOON AS THE RAIN ENDS.


[Captioner] 20:48:40
AND WE'LL BE BEGINNING THE 


[Captioner] 20:48:42
BASKETBALL UPGRADES AT THAT 


[Captioner] 20:48:42
TIME.


[Captioner] 20:48:43
>> Councilmember Cox:   WOULD IT 


[Captioner] 20:48:46
BE DONE BY THE SUMMER OR -- IS 


[Captioner] 20:48:48
THERE ANY IDEA?


[Captioner] 20:48:49
>> IF THE RAIN STOPS I WOULD 


[Captioner] 20:48:51
PREDICT THAT WE WOULD SEE IT 


[Captioner] 20:48:53
ACHIEVED BY SUMMERTIME, YES.


[Captioner] 20:48:54
>> Councilmember Cox:   OKAY, 


[Captioner] 20:48:55
THERE WOULD BE A LOT OF HAPPY, 


[Captioner] 20:48:56
HAPPY NEIGHBORS THERE.


[Captioner] 20:48:57
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:49:01
>> The Clerk:   MAYOR.


[Captioner] 20:49:05
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU, MY 


[Captioner] 20:49:06
CLARIFYING QUESTIONS, I THINK 


[Captioner] 20:49:08
SOME OF THEM WERE ASKED BY SOME 


[Captioner] 20:49:09
COUNCILMEMBERS BUT ONE OF THEM I 


[Captioner] 20:49:11
JUST WANTED TO FOLLOW UP ON, ONE 


[Captioner] 20:49:14
WAS PALM AVENUE, ON THE PREVIOUS 


[Captioner] 20:49:16
CIP, I'VE LOOKED OVER THE 


[Captioner] 20:49:17
PREVIOUS ONES WE APPROVED OVER 


[Captioner] 20:49:19
THE YEARS AND THAT WAS 


[Captioner] 20:49:21
ORIGINALLY FULLY FUNDED IN THE 


[Captioner] 20:49:22
LAST APPROVE BACK IN 2021 WITH 


[Captioner] 20:49:25
THE TARGET TO COMPLETE AND START 


[Captioner] 20:49:27
CONSTRUCTION BY 2024 OR 25.


[Captioner] 20:49:30
SO I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THAT, 


[Captioner] 20:49:33
BECAUSE ORIGINALLY THAT LAND WAS 


[Captioner] 20:49:36
SOLD HALF OF IT ON -- IN ORDER 


[Captioner] 20:49:38
TO PROVIDE THE FUNDING FOR OUR 


[Captioner] 20:49:39
DOWNTOWN EVENT CENTER.


[Captioner] 20:49:41
SO I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE 


[Captioner] 20:49:42
THAT IN COMMITMENT TO THE PUBLIC 


[Captioner] 20:49:44
SINCE WE APPROVED THE PREVIOUS 


[Captioner] 20:49:47
CIP THAT WE CONTINUE TO FULFILL 


[Captioner] 20:49:49
THE PROJECTS THAT WE AGREED TO.


[Captioner] 20:49:51
AND THEN I ALSO WOULD ECHO AND I 


[Captioner] 20:49:54
WOULD JUST SAY QUESTION-WISE FOR 


[Captioner] 20:49:55
THE FLAIFT, I KNOW WE TALKED 


[Captioner] 20:49:57
ABOUT THE TRAFFIC SIGNAL 


[Captioner] 20:49:59
IMPROVEMENTS AND THANK 


[Captioner] 20:50:00
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN FOR 


[Captioner] 20:50:02
ADDRESSING THAT TOO, THAT SIGNAL 


[Captioner] 20:50:03
IMPROVEMENTS IF WE'RE GOING TO 


[Captioner] 20:50:06
DEFUND IT, I WOULD LOVE TO SEE, 


[Captioner] 20:50:10
HOPEFULLY IT IS UNDER 


[Captioner] 20:50:12
CONSIDERATION.


[Captioner] 20:50:15
HOPEFULLY THERE IS OPPORTUNITY 


[Captioner] 20:50:17
DIRECTOR LARSEN, IT IS REALLY 


[Captioner] 20:50:19
CRITICAL FOR US FOR SOME OF THE 


[Captioner] 20:50:21
FUNDINGS WITH D.O.T.


[Captioner] 20:50:23
SO I HOPE WE COULD APPLY FOR 


[Captioner] 20:50:24
SOME OF THOSE GRANTS.


[Captioner] 20:50:30
THE OTHER ONE WAS ON KATO ROAD, 


[Captioner] 20:50:31
IS THERE ANYTHING WE CAN DO 


[Captioner] 20:50:31
THERE.


[Captioner] 20:50:33
I KNOW THERE HAS BEEN SOME 


[Captioner] 20:50:34
CONCERNS THERE IN THE PAST WITH 


[Captioner] 20:50:36
PARKING AND OTHER METHODS TO 


[Captioner] 20:50:38
ADDRESS IT BUT I'M JUST TRYING 


[Captioner] 20:50:40
TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WE CAN DO 


[Captioner] 20:50:41
WITH THE COMPLETE STREETS THERE, 


[Captioner] 20:50:42
WHETHER OR NOT THAT WAS 


[Captioner] 20:50:43
SOMETHING WE WOULD BRING BACK 


[Captioner] 20:50:46
FOR THE NEXT ROUND.


[Captioner] 20:50:47
AND I THINK THOSE WOULD BE JUST 


[Captioner] 20:50:48
MY GENERAL QUESTIONS.


[Captioner] 20:50:50
MY COMMENTS I'LL RESERVE UNTIL 


[Captioner] 20:50:50
AFTER.


[Captioner] 20:50:52
AND I KNOW WE HAVE TWO SPEAKERS 


[Captioner] 20:50:53
AND I THINK AFTER WE HEAR THE 


[Captioner] 20:50:55
TWO SPEAKERS WE ARE GOING TO BE 


[Captioner] 20:50:57
DUE FOR A BREAK.


[Captioner] 20:50:58
>> The Clerk:   WE HAVE FIVE 


[Captioner] 20:50:59
SPEAKERS, THREE IN PERSON AND 


[Captioner] 20:51:02
TWO ON ZOOM CURRENTLY.


[Captioner] 20:51:04
>> Mayor Mei:   I WANT TO DEFER 


[Captioner] 20:51:07
TO THEM, I'LL RESERVE MY 


[Captioner] 20:51:08
COMMENTS UNTIL AFTERWARDS.


[Captioner] 20:51:09
I THINK WE'LL CALL THE SPEAKERS 


[Captioner] 20:51:10
AT THIS TIME.


[Captioner] 20:51:11
>> The Clerk:   OKAY, TWO 


[Captioner] 20:51:12
MINUTES PER?


[Captioner] 20:51:13
>> Mayor Mei:   YES PLEASE.


[Captioner] 20:51:15
>> The Clerk:   TWO MINUTES.


[Captioner] 20:51:17
WE'LL START WITH SHARON VENTURA.


[Captioner] 20:51:28
>> Mayor Mei:   WELCOME, SHARON.


[Captioner] 20:51:29
>> OKAY, MY COMMENTS ARE 


[Captioner] 20:51:32
DIRECTED TO THE CIP AND 


[Captioner] 20:51:33
TRANSPORTATION.


[Captioner] 20:51:35
LAST MONTH, AT ONE OF THE CITY 


[Captioner] 20:51:38
COUNCIL MEETINGS, THAT WAS -- 


[Captioner] 20:51:39
HAD TECHNICAL CHALLENGES WITH 


[Captioner] 20:51:42
THE SOUND, I WAS FORCED TO 


[Captioner] 20:51:43
LISTEN TO THE RECORDING.


[Captioner] 20:51:50
HANS LARSEN REPORTED ON THE 


[Captioner] 20:51:52
PREVIOUS PROJECTS ON THE CIP 


[Captioner] 20:51:53
WERE EXPERIMENTS AND SOME FAILED 


[Captioner] 20:51:57
AND SOME DIDN'T.


[Captioner] 20:52:01
THOUGHTS, WE ARE CITIZENS, NOT 


[Captioner] 20:52:02
GUINEA PIGS.


[Captioner] 20:52:05
AND THE MISTAKES OF A HIGH LEVEL 


[Captioner] 20:52:08
EMPLOYEE HAVE CAUSED UNACCEPTING 


[Captioner] 20:52:09
CONSEQUENCES TO THE QUALITY OF 


[Captioner] 20:52:10
LIFE AND SAFETY OF MY 


[Captioner] 20:52:11
NEIGHBORHOOD.


[Captioner] 20:52:16
AND I'M SURE A NUMBER OF OTHERS.


[Captioner] 20:52:22
SO MY REQUEST AND MY IMPLORE TO 


[Captioner] 20:52:23
THE CITY COUNCIL IS TO 


[Captioner] 20:52:25
PRIORITIZE THE FUNDS FOR 


[Captioner] 20:52:27
UPCOMING BUDGET TO RECTIFY AND 


[Captioner] 20:52:31
REPAIR THE FAILS, BEFORE GOING 


[Captioner] 20:52:33
FORWARD AND ALLOWING MORE 


[Captioner] 20:52:33
CHANGES TO HAPPEN.


[Captioner] 20:52:48
AS FAR AS JENNY KASSAN, YOUR 


[Captioner] 20:52:50
DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION HAS 


[Captioner] 20:52:55
SPENT MULTIPLE FUNDS ON VISION 


[Captioner] 20:52:57
ZERO, I THINK THAT'S WHERE MOST 


[Captioner] 20:52:58
OF THE FUNDS HAVE GONE.


[Captioner] 20:53:00
BUT AGAIN LET'S FIX THESE 


[Captioner] 20:53:02
CHANGES BEFORE WE MOVE FORWARD 


[Captioner] 20:53:03
BLINDLY.


[Captioner] 20:53:03
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:53:04
>> The Clerk:   THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:53:06
I'LL DO THE NEXT SPEAKERS WHO 


[Captioner] 20:53:09
ARE HERE IN PERSON.


[Captioner] 20:53:14
BOB SIRWINSKI, FOLLOWED BY BARRY 


[Captioner] 20:53:14

WE KNOW THAT AT TIME OUR MAYOR 


[Captioner] 20:55:02

[Captioner] 20:55:05
LANDSCAPING THIS SECTION DUE TO 


[Captioner] 20:55:07
A POSSIBLE THREAT OF A HIGHWAY 


[Captioner] 20:55:09
CROSSING, A SMALL PORTION OF 


[Captioner] 20:55:09
THIS SECTION.


[Captioner] 20:55:14
THE REALITY HAS BEEN CLOSE TO 40 


[Captioner] 20:55:16
YEARS AND THERE'S STILL NO 


[Captioner] 20:55:17
HIGHWAY.


[Captioner] 20:55:21
ALSO, IN MEETING WITH HANS 


[Captioner] 20:55:24
 


[Captioner] 20:55:26
LARSEN HE AGREED ALSO IF THE 


[Captioner] 20:55:28

[Captioner] 20:55:31

[Captioner] 20:55:50
 SPEAKER IS BARRY 


[Captioner] 20:55:50
JENNINGS.


[Captioner] 20:55:52
>> YES, GOOD EVENING, ALMOST 


[Captioner] 20:55:54
GOOD MORNING, MAYOR, ALMOST 


[Captioner] 20:55:56
12:00 YOUR TIME, AND CITY 


[Captioner] 20:55:57
COUNCIL.


[Captioner] 20:56:01
AND OUR CITY MANAGER.


[Captioner] 20:56:04
I LIVE AT THE CORNER OF SECOND 


[Captioner] 20:56:06
AND J STREET IN THE NILES 


[Captioner] 20:56:07
DISTRICT.


[Captioner] 20:56:10
AND WE'VE JUST LEARNED THAT WE 


[Captioner] 20:56:16
ARE GETTING A SIDEWALK, AFTER 


[Captioner] 20:56:17
MAYBE 140 YEARS.


[Captioner] 20:56:20
AND THAT SIDEWALK IS GOING TO 


[Captioner] 20:56:23
CONNECT MY SIDEWALK, WHICH IS 


[Captioner] 20:56:26
APPROXIMATELY 90 YEARS OLD, WITH 


[Captioner] 20:56:30
A SIDEWALK AT THE END OF J 


[Captioner] 20:56:33
STREET, WHICH WOULD BE THIRD 


[Captioner] 20:56:34
STREET.


[Captioner] 20:56:36
THAT SIDEWALK'S APPROXIMATELY 25 


[Captioner] 20:56:36
YEARS OLD.


[Captioner] 20:56:39
SO THERE'S GOING TO BE A NEW 


[Captioner] 20:56:42
SIDEWALK WITH OUR ADJOINING 


[Captioner] 20:56:43
NEIGHBOR.


[Captioner] 20:56:45
SO THERE'S THREE PROPERTIES, TWO 


[Captioner] 20:56:48
SIDEWALKS EXIST, AND WE'RE 


[Captioner] 20:56:50
GETTING A NEW ONE WHICH IS 


[Captioner] 20:56:50
GREAT.


[Captioner] 20:56:51
WE'RE ALL HAPPY.


[Captioner] 20:56:53
BUT LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE IN 


[Captioner] 20:56:55
NILES, MY SIDEWALK IS VERY 


[Captioner] 20:56:56
UNIQUE.


[Captioner] 20:56:57
THE SIDEWALK THAT WE'RE GOING TO 


[Captioner] 20:57:02
BE CONNECTING TO IS UNIQUE.


[Captioner] 20:57:04
AND WE'RE REALLY AT A LOSS AS TO 


[Captioner] 20:57:06
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.


[Captioner] 20:57:09
HOW THEY'RE GOING TO TIE THE 


[Captioner] 20:57:11
SIDEWALKS TOGETHER.


[Captioner] 20:57:13
AND SO I'M NOT HERE TO MAKE A 


[Captioner] 20:57:13
COMMENT.


[Captioner] 20:57:17
I'M HERE MORE TO ASK A FAVOR OF 


[Captioner] 20:57:19
CITY COUNCIL, AND ENGINEERING, 


[Captioner] 20:57:23
AND OUR PLANNERS.


[Captioner] 20:57:26
AND THE FAVOR'S TWO FOAMED.


[Captioner] 20:57:29
WE'RE GETTING THIS NEW SIDEWALK.


[Captioner] 20:57:31
BUT WE ALSO, I HAVE A MYSTERY AT 


[Captioner] 20:57:34
THE CORNER OF SECOND AND J.


[Captioner] 20:57:36
IT'S A VERY OLD TREE.


[Captioner] 20:57:45
HISTORIC TREE, IT IS A CATALPA, 


[Captioner] 20:57:47
THE LARGEST AT LEAST IN THE 


[Captioner] 20:57:48
COUNTY OR IN THE NORTHERN PART 


[Captioner] 20:57:49
OF THE STATE.


[Captioner] 20:57:52
IT IS CONNECTED TO A WHICH IS 


[Captioner] 20:57:54
 WISTERIA ON 


[Captioner] 20:57:55
MY PROPERTY.


[Captioner] 20:57:56
IS MY TIME UP?


[Captioner] 20:57:57
>> The Clerk:   YES.


[Captioner] 20:57:59
>> REAL QUICKLY I'M ASKING THE 


[Captioner] 20:58:00
FAVOR THAT THE ENGINEERS THAT 


[Captioner] 20:58:01
ARE PART OF THIS PROJECT MEET 


[Captioner] 20:58:04
WITH US BEFORE ANY GROUND IS 


[Captioner] 20:58:05
BROKEN.


[Captioner] 20:58:06
BECAUSE WE WOULD LIKE TO TAKE 


[Captioner] 20:58:09
CARE OF THAT TREE.


[Captioner] 20:58:10
MAYBE A BUMP-OUT.


[Captioner] 20:58:12
MAYBE A MEANDERING SIDEWALK 


[Captioner] 20:58:13
AROUND IT.


[Captioner] 20:58:14
BECAUSE THAT'S THE BEGINNING OF 


[Captioner] 20:58:18
OUR NEW SIDEWALK.


[Captioner] 20:58:20
AND, WE HAVE NO IDEA HOW THIS 


[Captioner] 20:58:22
NEW SIDEWALK IS GOING TO AFFECT 


[Captioner] 20:58:23
US.


[Captioner] 20:58:25
SO WE'RE JUST ASKING FOR A 


[Captioner] 20:58:28
MEETING OF ANY KIND WITH THE 


[Captioner] 20:58:30
ENGINEERS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS 


[Captioner] 20:58:31
PROJECT.


[Captioner] 20:58:32
SO THANK YOU AND I'M SORRY I 


[Captioner] 20:58:34
TOOK TOO LONG.


[Captioner] 20:58:35
>> The Clerk:   I HAVE YOUR 


[Captioner] 20:58:38
CONTACT INFORMATION HERE.


[Captioner] 20:58:39
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:58:48
THE NEXT SPEAKER IS SUSHIL 
SUCLA.


[Captioner] 20:58:53
>> YES, HELLO.


[Captioner] 20:58:57
SO I HAVE A SUGGESTION TO ADD A 


[Captioner] 20:58:59
PROJECT TO THE CAPITAL 


[Captioner] 20:59:02
IMPROVEMENT.


[Captioner] 20:59:03
AND AUTO MALL PARKWAY IS ONE OF 


[Captioner] 20:59:06
THE MOST POPULAR STREETS IN THE 


[Captioner] 20:59:07
CITY.


[Captioner] 20:59:10
AND IT CONNECTS 680 TO 880.


[Captioner] 20:59:12
AND NOT ONLY THE FREMONT 


[Captioner] 20:59:14
RESIDENTS LIKE US, THE PEOPLE 


[Captioner] 20:59:16
FROM -- THEY ALL COME TO THAT 


[Captioner] 20:59:17
STREET A LOT.


[Captioner] 20:59:21
SO THERE IS A SCOPE OFF BIG 


[Captioner] 20:59:23
IMPROVEMENT ON THAT CITY, IS 


[Captioner] 20:59:26
MEDIAN SORRY ON THAT STREET, THE 


[Captioner] 20:59:28
MEDIAN ON THAT ROAD BETWEEN THE 


[Captioner] 20:59:30
GRIMMER AND THE FREMONT 


[Captioner] 20:59:35
BOULEVARD, IS -- THERE IS A LOT 


[Captioner] 20:59:37
OF BEADS AND THOSE THINGS AND 


[Captioner] 20:59:39
THEY GET PERIODICALLY CLEANED UP 


[Captioner] 20:59:41
SO THE CITY IS DOING A GOOD JOB 


[Captioner] 20:59:42
ON THAT.


[Captioner] 20:59:44
BUT MY SUGGESTION IS TO DO SOME 


[Captioner] 20:59:45
INVESTMENT AND MAKE THAT LOOK 


[Captioner] 20:59:46
NICE.


[Captioner] 20:59:48
THAT WOULD MAKE THAT AREA LOOK 


[Captioner] 20:59:50
VERY, VERY GOOD AND DO THE GOOD 


[Captioner] 20:59:51
IMPROVEMENT TO THE CITY AS A 


[Captioner] 20:59:52
WHOLE ALSO.


[Captioner] 20:59:53
THAT IS SUGGESTION THAT I HAVE.


[Captioner] 20:59:55
AND I JUST WANT TO ADD ONE 


[Captioner] 20:59:56
COMMENT, THAT THANKS TO THE 


[Captioner] 20:59:58
COUNCIL, THAT FREMONT IS 


[Captioner] 21:00:00
CONSIDERED ONE OF THE HAPPIEST 


[Captioner] 21:00:01
CITY IN THE COUNTRY.


[Captioner] 21:00:03
NOW THESE KINDS OF IMPROVEMENTS 


[Captioner] 21:00:04
THAT WE ARE DISCUSSING WILL MAKE 


[Captioner] 21:00:07
IT EVEN MORE HAPPIER THAN THE 


[Captioner] 21:00:09
CURRENT HAPPIEST CITY.


[Captioner] 21:00:11
THAT'S IT, THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 21:00:12
>> The Clerk:   THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 21:00:18
THE NEXT SPEAKER IN PERSON IS 


[Captioner] 21:00:21
MONICA ICEBACKER.


[Captioner] 21:00:26
>> HI.


[Captioner] 21:00:31
MY NAME IS MONICA ASHBACKER, I 


[Captioner] 21:00:35
ALSO LIVE IN MISSION LAKES LIKE 


[Captioner] 21:00:39
BOB DARINSKI AND I'M HERE TO 


[Captioner] 21:00:42
SUPPORT HIS PROJECT TO PUT IN A 


[Captioner] 21:00:44
MEDIAN EMBELLISHMENT ON PASEO 


[Captioner] 21:00:47
PADRE ON THE STRETCH FROM DECOTO 


[Captioner] 21:00:47
TO ISHERWOOD.


[Captioner] 21:00:50
I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO BENEFIT 


[Captioner] 21:00:53
FROM MY TIME TO REALLY THANK THE 


[Captioner] 21:00:55
PLANNERS OF THIS CITY AND THIS 


[Captioner] 21:00:58
CITY COUNCIL, TO SAY, THIS 


[Captioner] 21:01:00
GENTLEMAN BEFORE ME SAID, MAKE 


[Captioner] 21:01:02
FREMONT A BETTER PLACE OR THE 


[Captioner] 21:01:02
PEOPLE.


[Captioner] 21:01:06
SO I REALLY APPRECIATE ALL THE 


[Captioner] 21:01:08
PROJECTS, ESPECIALLY DEAR TO MY 


[Captioner] 21:01:11
HEART IS VISION ZERO WITH ALL 


[Captioner] 21:01:13
THE BIKE LANES.


[Captioner] 21:01:16
SO I WOULD ACTUALLY ENCOURAGE 


[Captioner] 21:01:18
RESIDENTS TO COME OUT WITH THEIR 


[Captioner] 21:01:19
BIKES AND REALLY TAKE ADVANTAGE 


[Captioner] 21:01:21
OF THAT.


[Captioner] 21:01:24
AND THEN A FUTURE PROJECT ALSO 


[Captioner] 21:01:25
TO REALLY DO SOMETHING FOR THE 


[Captioner] 21:01:28
PEOPLE, RIGHT, THAT LIVE CLOSE 


[Captioner] 21:01:29
TO DECOTO.


[Captioner] 21:01:31

[Captioner] 21:01:34
IMPROVEMENTS THERE FROM 


[Captioner] 21:01:38
DUMBARTON TO PASEO PADRE, ALONG 


[Captioner] 21:01:41
DECOTO AND THEN OF COURSE ALSO 


[Captioner] 21:01:43
NILES CANYON TRAIL.


[Captioner] 21:01:45
SO BUT I CAN SEE HOW THIS ALL 


[Captioner] 21:01:46
COMES TOGETHER.


[Captioner] 21:01:53
SO I THINK REALLY EMBELLISHING 


[Captioner] 21:01:56
THIS MEDIAN THAT HAS BEEN DRAB 


[Captioner] 21:01:58
AS BOB POINTED OUT FOR SUCH A 


[Captioner] 21:02:00
LONG TIME, IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT 


[Captioner] 21:02:02
FOR SAFETY, SAFETY CONCERN 


[Captioner] 21:02:03
BECAUSE WITH THE HEADLIGHTS THAT 


[Captioner] 21:02:06
ARE VERY STRONG SOMETIMES ON 


[Captioner] 21:02:11
CARS, AT NIGHT, IT'S ACTUALLY A 


[Captioner] 21:02:13
REALLY -- A BLINDING, THERE IS A 


[Captioner] 21:02:17
BLINDING DANGER IF WE DON'T HAVE 


[Captioner] 21:02:19
LANDSCAPING THERE, AND THAT'S 


[Captioner] 21:02:21
BEEN GOING ON FOR A LONG TIME.


[Captioner] 21:02:24
SO AGAIN I REALLY THANK YOU FOR 


[Captioner] 21:02:25

[Captioner] 21:02:27

[Captioner] 21:02:54
AND I RECENTLY MET MY COUSIN'S 


[Captioner] 21:02:59
BROTHER AND HIS WIFE IN MUMBAI 


[Captioner] 21:03:05
INDIA, WE SPOAKD ABOUT HOW SLIFN

[Captioner] 21:03:19
AFTER RETURNING TO INDIA, WE 


[Captioner] 21:03:22
WENT INTO FREMONT COSTCO AND 


[Captioner] 21:03:24
WENT INTO THE AUTO MALL THAT 


[Captioner] 21:03:29
CONNECTS THE TWO FREEWAYS, 680 


[Captioner] 21:03:31
AND 880, WE NOTICED THAT FREMONT 


[Captioner] 21:03:34
PARKWAY HAS BEEN BEAR RON AND 


[Captioner] 21:03:36
UNDEVELOPED, THERE ARE A LOT OF 


[Captioner] 21:03:37
WEEDS GROWING TALL AND THE WHOLE 


[Captioner] 21:03:40
SITE IS AN EYESORE THAT LOOKS 


[Captioner] 21:03:41
LIKE A RUN DOWN AREA.


[Captioner] 21:03:43
I THOUGHT TO MYSELF, IS THIS THE 


[Captioner] 21:03:46
IMAGE MY COUSIN BROTHER WILL SEE 


[Captioner] 21:03:51
WHEN HE'S WITH ME IN FREMONT, 


[Captioner] 21:03:54
WHILE DRIVING FROM SAN FRANCISCO 


[Captioner] 21:03:56

[Captioner] 21:03:59
ASKING, IS FREMONT A POOR CITY 


[Captioner] 21:04:01
IN SILICON VALLEY, PRAISING ONE 


[Captioner] 21:04:03

[Captioner] 21:04:06
VALLEY TO LOOK FAKE, WE WERE 


[Captioner] 21:04:08
VISITING SO MANY CITIES AND SO 


[Captioner] 21:04:13
IMPRESSED BY THE ESTHETICALLY 


[Captioner] 21:04:18
PLEASING ROAD DIVIDERS, IT MADE 


[Captioner] 21:04:22
US ENCOURAGED BY, THIS IS A VERY 


[Captioner] 21:04:25
IMPORTANT ARTERY CONNECTING 680 


[Captioner] 21:04:28
AND 880 AND ANYBODY PASSING THIS 


[Captioner] 21:04:29
ARTERY WILL FORM AN IMPRESSION 


[Captioner] 21:04:30
ABOUT FREMONT.


[Captioner] 21:04:32
DOES OUR CITY MANAGER WANT A BAD 


[Captioner] 21:04:34
IMPRESSION OR A GOOD IMPRESSION?


[Captioner] 21:04:36
A GOOD IMPRESSION WILL GO A LONG 


[Captioner] 21:04:38
WAY TO ATTRACT PEOPLE AND 


[Captioner] 21:04:40
COMPANIES TO MOVE TO FREMONT.


[Captioner] 21:04:41
THIS PROJECT WILL BOOST OUR 


[Captioner] 21:04:43

[Captioner] 21:06:55
>> The Clerk:   MAYOR YOU'LL 


[Captioner] 21:06:57
HAVE TO START OVER.


[Captioner] 21:06:59
YOU'RE CUTTING OUT.


[Captioner] 21:07:00
>> Mayor Mei:   OKAY, I WAS JUST 


[Captioner] 21:07:02
SAYING THAT TONIGHT THIS ITEM IS 


[Captioner] 21:07:04
ACTUALLY NOT AN ACTION ITEM.


[Captioner] 21:07:05
IT'S TO RECEIVE THE REPORT.


[Captioner] 21:07:08
AND WE'LL BE COMING BACK WITH 


[Captioner] 21:07:09
THE CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM 


[Captioner] 21:07:12
IN A FEW WEEKS, THE ACTUAL 


[Captioner] 21:07:13
APPROVAL.


[Captioner] 21:07:14
THIS IS JUST A RECOMMENDATION OF 


[Captioner] 21:07:17
SOME OF THE PROJECTS AND FOR US 


[Captioner] 21:07:18
TO PROVIDE SOME DIRECTION AND 


[Captioner] 21:07:19
FEEDBACK.


[Captioner] 21:07:21
SO I APPRECIATE EVERYONE FOR 


[Captioner] 21:07:22
THEIR DIRECTION AND FEEDBACK.


[Captioner] 21:07:25
WE ARE OVERDUE FOR A BREAK WITH 


[Captioner] 21:07:29
OUR STENO CAPTIONER BUT I ALSO 


[Captioner] 21:07:31
WANT TO SEE IF THE COUNCIL FEELS 


[Captioner] 21:07:35
IF WE CAN MOVE THROUGH REST OF 


[Captioner] 21:07:37
OUR ACTION IN A TIMELY MANNER OR 


[Captioner] 21:07:40
WE FEEL WE SHOULD GO FOR A BREAK 


[Captioner] 21:07:42
FIRST?


[Captioner] 21:07:43
>> Vice Mayor Keng:   WE SHOULD 


[Captioner] 21:07:44
GO FOR A BREAK.


[Captioner] 21:07:45
>> Mayor Mei:   THIS IS 


[Captioner] 21:07:47
INFORMATIONAL NOT AN ACTION JUST 


[Captioner] 21:07:48
TO CLARIFY.


[Captioner] 21:07:49
>> The Clerk:   SORRY, IT'S 


[Captioner] 21:07:50
CONSENSUS TO TAKE A BREAK.


[Captioner] 21:07:53
OKAY.


[Captioner] 21:07:54
YES, MAYOR, WE HAVE CONSENSUS TO 


[Captioner] 21:07:55
TAKE A BREAK.


[Captioner] 21:07:58
>> Mayor Mei:   OKAY, WE'LL TAKE 


[Captioner] 21:08:00
A FIVE MINUTE BREAK.


[Captioner] 21:08:02

[Captioner] 21:15:39
>> Councilmember Kassan:   THANK 


[Captioner] 21:15:39
YOU.


[Captioner] 21:15:41
I WOULD JUST REALLY LOVE US TO 


[Captioner] 21:15:43
PUT SOME REAL RESOURCES TOWARDS 


[Captioner] 21:15:45
MORE TREES.


[Captioner] 21:15:47
I'M SO EXCITED THAT WE DID GET 


[Captioner] 21:15:49
THOSE GRANTS TO CREATE A PLAN.


[Captioner] 21:15:51
I FEEL LIKE COMPARED TOMENT 


[Captioner] 21:15:55
 TO MANY 


[Captioner] 21:15:57
CITIES AROUND IT WE JUST DON'T 


[Captioner] 21:15:59
HAVE A LOT OF TREE COVER, 


[Captioner] 21:16:00
COMPARED TO SOME NEIGHBORHOODS 


[Captioner] 21:16:02
THAT WOULD BE HEALTHY AND 


[Captioner] 21:16:02
ATTRACTIVE.


[Captioner] 21:16:04
MY ASK IS FOR TREES.


[Captioner] 21:16:04
THANK YOU.

>> The Clerk:   VICE MAYOR KENG

[Captioner] 21:16:13
>> Vice Mayor Keng:   THANK YOU 


[Captioner] 21:16:14
VERY MUCH FOR THE PRESENTATION 


[Captioner] 21:16:16
TONIGHT AND THE UPDATE.


[Captioner] 21:16:18
I'M GLAD TO SEE THAT THE 


[Captioner] 21:16:19
BATHROOMS IN THE PARKS WILL 


[Captioner] 21:16:24
FINALLY GET AN UPDATE AND 


[Captioner] 21:16:25
GETTING NEW BATHROOMS HAS BEEN A 


[Captioner] 21:16:28
LOT OF ASKS, ESPECIALLY FOR 


[Captioner] 21:16:29
CHILDREN AND FAMILIES USING 


[Captioner] 21:16:30
THOSE BATHROOMS.


[Captioner] 21:16:32
WHEN THEY PLAY AT THE PARKS.


[Captioner] 21:16:34
AND SOME OF THE PROGRAMS ARE 


[Captioner] 21:16:37
MOVING ALONG, SO THAT'S GREAT 


[Captioner] 21:16:38
NEWS.


[Captioner] 21:16:40
PROBABLY CAN HOLD SOME PARTIES 


[Captioner] 21:16:42
AT THE NEIGHBORHOOD PARKS WHEN 


[Captioner] 21:16:44
THOSE TRAILS ARE OPEN SO LOOKING 


[Captioner] 21:16:47
FORWARD TO THAT SO THANK YOU 


[Captioner] 21:16:47
VERY MUCH.


[Captioner] 21:16:50
>> The Clerk:   COUNCILMEMBER 


[Captioner] 21:16:50
SALWAN.


[Captioner] 21:16:51
>> Councilmember Salwan:   THANK 


[Captioner] 21:16:52
YOU.


[Captioner] 21:16:55
YES, GREATLY DISCUSSION, 


[Captioner] 21:16:56
APPRECIATE ALL THE COMPREHENSIVE 


[Captioner] 21:16:59
ANALYSIS AND SHORT TERM, LONG 


[Captioner] 21:17:01
TERM, AND, YOU KNOW, VISIONARY 


[Captioner] 21:17:03
FOR THE FUTURE.


[Captioner] 21:17:06
SO I GUESS ONE THING THAT I WILL 


[Captioner] 21:17:07
STRUGGLE WITH IS ALL THE CITY 


[Captioner] 21:17:08
BUILDINGS.


[Captioner] 21:17:12
YOU KNOW I KNOW WE APPROVED 


[Captioner] 21:17:14
HVAC, I CAN'T REMEMBER, AT SOME 


[Captioner] 21:17:16
POINT I THOUGHT WE HAD ALREADY 


[Captioner] 21:17:17
DONE IT FOR CITY HALL.


[Captioner] 21:17:19
IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE AN 


[Captioner] 21:17:22
 


[Captioner] 21:17:24
INVENTORY, FOR EACH SPECIFIC 


[Captioner] 21:17:26
BUILDING, SO WE HAVE KIND OF A 


[Captioner] 21:17:28
MASTER PLAN RATHER THAN A ONE 


[Captioner] 21:17:30
OFF REQUEST FOR HVAC CHANGING OR 


[Captioner] 21:17:31
ROOFING.


[Captioner] 21:17:32
AND I SORT OF FEEL LIKE WE'VE 


[Captioner] 21:17:34
DONE SOME OF THESE BUT IT MAY BE 


[Captioner] 21:17:36
IN DIFFERENT BUILDINGS THAT -- I 


[Captioner] 21:17:38
THINK MAYBE THERE WAS ONE IN THE 


[Captioner] 21:17:39
LIBERTY BUILDING.


[Captioner] 21:17:42
SO BUT IT WOULD BE NICE TO KNOW 


[Captioner] 21:17:43
WHAT ALL THINGS THAT STAFF IS 


[Captioner] 21:17:45
LOOKING AT AT THE DIFFERENT 


[Captioner] 21:17:47
BUILDINGS THAT WE OWN, A MASTER 


[Captioner] 21:17:49
LIST AND WHEN SORT OF 


[Captioner] 21:17:50
MAINTENANCE NEEDS TO BE DONE AND 


[Captioner] 21:17:52
WHAT SORT OF UPGRADES NEED TO BE 


[Captioner] 21:17:53
DONE AND WHAT KIND OF THE VISION 


[Captioner] 21:17:55
IS FOR EACH OF THOSE BUILDINGS.


[Captioner] 21:17:57
THAT WOULD HELP ME AS A POLICY 


[Captioner] 21:17:59
MAKER DECIDING YOU KNOW WHERE WE 


[Captioner] 21:18:01
ALLOCATE THE RESOURCES AND HOW 


[Captioner] 21:18:03
WE CAN GET AHEAD OF THIS SO THAT 


[Captioner] 21:18:04
WOULD BE GREAT.


[Captioner] 21:18:05
THE COMMUNITY CENTER AS CENTRAL 


[Captioner] 21:18:08
PARK I THOUGHT THAT WAS GREAT.


[Captioner] 21:18:09
I THINK THE ONE WE HAVE HERE IN 


[Captioner] 21:18:11
THE DOWNTOWN EVENT CENTER IS 


[Captioner] 21:18:12
REALLY SUCCESSFUL, SEEING LOTS 


[Captioner] 21:18:15
OF EVENTS COMING TO FREMONT.


[Captioner] 21:18:17
THE ONLY ISSUE IS THAT THE 


[Captioner] 21:18:19
CENTERS ARE VERY SMALL.


[Captioner] 21:18:21
AND SO, YOU KNOW, HOPEFULLY, THE 


[Captioner] 21:18:23
ONE WE'RE BUILDING AT LAKE 


[Captioner] 21:18:26
ELIZABETH WE CAN HAVE MORE 


[Captioner] 21:18:27
CAPACITY THAN WE HAVE NOW.


[Captioner] 21:18:29
AND ALSO THE WAY WE BUILT IT NOW 


[Captioner] 21:18:31
YOU CAN'T OPEN UP THE TWO ROOMS.


[Captioner] 21:18:34
AND I THINK IF WE HAD ACCESS TO 


[Captioner] 21:18:35
BOTH ROOMS AT THE SAME TIME WE 


[Captioner] 21:18:37
WOULD HAVE A LOT MORE FOLKS 


[Captioner] 21:18:39
WANTING TO USE OUR FACILITIES.


[Captioner] 21:18:42
SO I WOULD BE OPEN TO LOOKING TO 


[Captioner] 21:18:45
ADD EVEN MORE FUNDING TO HAVE A 


[Captioner] 21:18:48
LARGER CENTER TO ADD SOMETHING 


[Captioner] 21:18:50
THAT HASN'T BEEN DONE AT THE 


[Captioner] 21:18:56
DOWNTOWN EVENTS CENTER.


[Captioner] 21:18:58
AND AT THE LAKE AND WE SHOULD 


[Captioner] 21:18:59
ENCOURAGE A LOT OF COMMUNITY 


[Captioner] 21:19:00
PLACES.


[Captioner] 21:19:01
WE HAVE DONE WELL IN THE PAST 


[Captioner] 21:19:04
FEW YEARS AS FAR AS THE AGE WELL 


[Captioner] 21:19:06
CENTER, DOWNTOWN EVENTS CENTER, 


[Captioner] 21:19:08
LOTS OF GREAT GREAT PROJECTS 


[Captioner] 21:19:09
INCLUDING BART AND THE BRIDGE 


[Captioner] 21:19:10
CONNECTING THE AREA BEHIND IT.


[Captioner] 21:19:17
THERE WAS A MENTION OF THE 100 


[Captioner] 21:19:19
WORST SIDEWALKS THAT WE HAD 


[Captioner] 21:19:22
FUNDED IN 2016, 2017, CAN'T 


[Captioner] 21:19:24
REMEMBER, DID WE COMPLETE THE 


[Captioner] 21:19:25
100 WORST SIDEWALKS?


[Captioner] 21:19:26
>> Hans Larsen:   YES, SO KIND 


[Captioner] 21:19:28
OF THE REFERENCE TO THAT IN THE 


[Captioner] 21:19:30
PRESENTATION IS THAT SO WE, YOU 


[Captioner] 21:19:32
KNOW, IT'S BEEN LIKE I THINK 


[Captioner] 21:19:34
LIKE FIVE OR SIX YEARS THAT 


[Captioner] 21:19:35
WE'VE BEEN INVESTING EVERY YEAR 


[Captioner] 21:19:39
IN DOING THE 100 WORST 


[Captioner] 21:19:39
SIDEWALKS.


[Captioner] 21:19:41
SO THE GOOD NEWS IS WELL, WE 


[Captioner] 21:19:42
HAVE TWO MORE YEARS LEFT.


[Captioner] 21:19:47
AND THEN THE SIDEWALKS THAT WE 


[Captioner] 21:19:54
CONSIDER IN SEVERELY DAMAGED 


[Captioner] 21:19:55
CONDITION WILL BE FINISHED.


[Captioner] 21:19:57
WE REACHED A MILESTONE IN THAT 


[Captioner] 21:20:00
PROJECT.


[Captioner] 21:20:02
SEVERELY DAMAGED SIDEWALK IS 


[Captioner] 21:20:03
WHERE THERE IS MORE THAN FOUR 


[Captioner] 21:20:04
INCHES OF DEFLECTION.


[Captioner] 21:20:05
JUST TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION.


[Captioner] 21:20:07
WE'RE WELL ON THE WAY BUT TWO 


[Captioner] 21:20:09
MORE YEARS WITH THE CURRENT 


[Captioner] 21:20:11
FUNDING THAT WE HAVE, WE'LL BE 


[Captioner] 21:20:13
ABLE TO COMPLETE THAT PROGRAM.


[Captioner] 21:20:14
>> Councilmember Salwan:   OKAY, 


[Captioner] 21:20:14
THAT'S GREAT.


[Captioner] 21:20:15
HOPEFULLY WE CAN GET THE WORK 


[Captioner] 21:20:17
OUT SO THAT MORE PEOPLE KNOW ALL 


[Captioner] 21:20:19
THE WORK THAT WE'VE DONE.


[Captioner] 21:20:22
I'M SURE THAT, I ALWAYS GET SO 


[Captioner] 21:20:23
MANY COMPLAINTS AND I THINK 


[Captioner] 21:20:25
WE'VE COME A LONG WAYS AS FAR AS 


[Captioner] 21:20:26
THOSE SIDEWALKS.


[Captioner] 21:20:28
ONE OF THE ISSUES IS THAT WE ARE 


[Captioner] 21:20:30
SUCH A LARGE CITY, WE HAVE SO 


[Captioner] 21:20:30
MANY NEEDS.


[Captioner] 21:20:32
WHEN WE PRIORITIZE THE FUNDING 


[Captioner] 21:20:34
IF WE CAN FOCUS IN ON THREE OR 


[Captioner] 21:20:36
FOUR THINGS THAT WE CAN ACHIEVE 


[Captioner] 21:20:37
IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS I 


[Captioner] 21:20:39
THINK THAT WOULD BE VERY 


[Captioner] 21:20:39
HELPFUL.


[Captioner] 21:20:41
NOT ONLY FOR US BUT ALSO FOR THE 


[Captioner] 21:20:42
COMMUNITY.


[Captioner] 21:20:44
TO SEE THAT WE CAN CHANNEL OUR 


[Captioner] 21:20:46
RESOURCES TO GET SOMETHING DONE 


[Captioner] 21:20:47
FAST.


[Captioner] 21:20:50
YOU KNOW, GOVERNMENT'S OFTEN 


[Captioner] 21:20:52
CRITICIZED FOR BEING SLOW AND 


[Captioner] 21:20:52
NOT RESPONSIVE.


[Captioner] 21:20:54
AND SO RATHER THAN DOING 20 


[Captioner] 21:20:55
THINGS WE CAN DO A FEW THINGS 


[Captioner] 21:20:57
AND GET THEM DONE, WOULD I LIKE 


[Captioner] 21:21:07
TO SEE US GO THAT DIRECTION.


[Captioner] 21:21:09
BUT WE DO HAVE DIFFERENT 


[Captioner] 21:21:11
SESSIONS TO WORK ON THAT.


[Captioner] 21:21:12
REGARDING THE AUTO MALL, I KNOW 


[Captioner] 21:21:15
WE HAVE SO MANY NEEDS AND WE 


[Captioner] 21:21:17
CAN'T DEDICATE RESOURCES FOR 


[Captioner] 21:21:17
SOMETHING.


[Captioner] 21:21:19
IT DOES INTRIGUE ME THAT AUTO 


[Captioner] 21:21:23
MALL IS KIND OF ONE OF THE WORST 


[Captioner] 21:21:25
CROSS-INTERSECTIONS THAT WE HAVE 


[Captioner] 21:21:27
AND FRANKLY THAT IS WHERE MOST 


[Captioner] 21:21:29
OF OUR MONEY IS MADE FROM 


[Captioner] 21:21:30
PACIFIC COMMONS TO WALMART.


[Captioner] 21:21:33
WE CAN DEFINITELY LOOK AT 


[Captioner] 21:21:34
BEAUTIFYING THAT A LITTLE BIT, I 


[Captioner] 21:21:35
DON'T KNOW, BIKE PATH IN THE 


[Captioner] 21:21:37
CENTER OR I DON'T KNOW.


[Captioner] 21:21:38
THERE MUST BE SOME WAYS TO MAKE 


[Captioner] 21:21:40
IT LOOK BETTER.


[Captioner] 21:21:41
IT IS DEFINITELY THE WORST EXIT 


[Captioner] 21:21:42
WE HAVE IN FREMONT.


[Captioner] 21:21:45
AND SO I REALIZE WE CAN'T DO 


[Captioner] 21:21:46
THIS OVERNIGHT BUT MAYBE SOME 


[Captioner] 21:21:48
SORT OF PLANNING OVER TIME WE 


[Captioner] 21:21:50
CAN HELP IMPROVE THAT AREA.


[Captioner] 21:21:51
ESPECIALLY SINCE WE HAVE SO MUCH 


[Captioner] 21:21:53
SALES TAXES COMING IN.


[Captioner] 21:21:55
AND SO WHY NOT DEDICATE MORE OF 


[Captioner] 21:21:57
THAT WHERE THE MONEY'S COMING 


[Captioner] 21:21:58
FROM.


[Captioner] 21:22:00
WHICH IS AUTO MALL, IN THAT 


[Captioner] 21:22:02
MIRACLE MILE OF FREMONT.


[Captioner] 21:22:06
SO HOPEFULLY WE CAN STRATEGIZE 


[Captioner] 21:22:08
IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS TO SEE HOW 


[Captioner] 21:22:10
WE CAN TRY TO FUND THAT.


[Captioner] 21:22:11
THAT'S ALL THE COMMENTS I HAVE 


[Captioner] 21:22:12
FOR NOW.


[Captioner] 21:22:14
APPRECIATE STAFF'S WORK AND 


[Captioner] 21:22:15
APPRECIATE THE TEAM APPROACH, 


[Captioner] 21:22:15
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 21:22:18
>> The Clerk:   AND 


[Captioner] 21:22:19
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN AND MAYOR 


[Captioner] 21:22:21
MEI I WANT TO RESPOND TO YOUR 


[Captioner] 21:22:22
EARLIER QUESTION BEFORE THE 


[Captioner] 21:22:24
BREAK.


[Captioner] 21:22:26
PALM AVENUE PARK IS READY TO GO.


[Captioner] 21:22:28
IT'S BEEN FULLY FUNDED IN THE 


[Captioner] 21:22:30
LAST CYCLE AND WE WILL START OUR 


[Captioner] 21:22:31
COMMUNITY PROCESS IN LATE 2023 


[Captioner] 21:22:33
TO RECEIVE COMMUNITY INPUT ON 


[Captioner] 21:22:35
THE TYPE OF PARK AMENITIES WE 


[Captioner] 21:22:36
WOULD HAVE THERE.


[Captioner] 21:22:41
>> The Clerk:   COUNCILMEMBER 


[Captioner] 21:22:42
COX FOLLOWED BY COUNCILMEMBER 


[Captioner] 21:22:45

[Captioner] 21:22:45
>> Councilmember Cox:   THANK 


[Captioner] 21:22:48
YOU SO MUCH.


[Captioner] 21:22:50
I THINK THAT WE'VE HAD A REALLY 


[Captioner] 21:22:51
GOOD DISCUSSION TONIGHT.


[Captioner] 21:22:53
AND I THINK THAT I WOULD STILL 


[Captioner] 21:22:57
LIKE TO SEE THE PRIORITY BE THAT 


[Captioner] 21:23:00
IT'S HEALTH AND SAFETY.


[Captioner] 21:23:04
BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THE 


[Captioner] 21:23:06
HIGH IMPORTANCE OF THAT.


[Captioner] 21:23:10
AND I JUST THINK THAT IT WOULD 


[Captioner] 21:23:12
BE INTERESTING TO HEAR WHAT THE 


[Captioner] 21:23:14
OTHER PUBLIC MEETINGS, WHAT THE 


[Captioner] 21:23:18
OTHER RESIDENTS THAT COME, WHAT 


[Captioner] 21:23:20
WOULD BE SOME OF THEIR INPUT AS 


[Captioner] 21:23:21
WELL.


[Captioner] 21:23:24
AS FAR AS I WAS THINKING OUT 


[Captioner] 21:23:25
LOUD AS COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN WAS 


[Captioner] 21:23:28
TALKING, IN REGARDS TO SOME OF 


[Captioner] 21:23:30
THE BEAUTIFICATION THERE, WHICH 


[Captioner] 21:23:33
KIND OF BORDER LINES BOTH OF OUR 


[Captioner] 21:23:35
DISTRICTS 5 AND 6, IT WOULD BE 


[Captioner] 21:23:38
GREAT TO HAVE MAYBE A 


[Captioner] 21:23:38
PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP WITH 


[Captioner] 21:23:40
SOME OF THE BUSINESSES, LIKE A 


[Captioner] 21:23:46
WALMART OR THE WHOLE AUTO MALL 


[Captioner] 21:23:47
 


[Captioner] 21:23:49
DEALERSHIPS, ADOPTING DIFFERENT 


[Captioner] 21:23:51
MEDIUMS IN FRONT OF THEIR AREA.


[Captioner] 21:23:53
IT COULD BE ANOTHER WAY OF 


[Captioner] 21:23:54
ADVERTISING BUT HEY WE COULD 


[Captioner] 21:23:56
STILL GET SOME BEAUTIFUL FLOWERS 


[Captioner] 21:23:58
AND BEAUTIFUL LANDSCAPING 


[Captioner] 21:23:58
PIECES.


[Captioner] 21:24:00
I WAS JUST THINKING ABOUT THAT 


[Captioner] 21:24:03
AS SOME CREATIVITY, ADOPT A 


[Captioner] 21:24:04
MEDIAN INSTEAD OF ADOPT A 


[Captioner] 21:24:06
HIGHWAY WITH THE HIGHWAY 


[Captioner] 21:24:07
PROGRAM, WE HAVE ADOPT A MEDIAN 


[Captioner] 21:24:09
AND OPEN THAT UP.


[Captioner] 21:24:11
I JUST WAS THINKING ABOUT THAT 


[Captioner] 21:24:13
AS SOMETHING TO KIND OF 


[Captioner] 21:24:16
BRAINSTORM FOR A MOMENT THERE.


[Captioner] 21:24:19
I -- ON ANOTHER NOTE, I KNOW 


[Captioner] 21:24:20
THAT THE COMMUNITY CENTER, I 


[Captioner] 21:24:23
KNOW IRVINGTON SO WELL, IN TERMS 


[Captioner] 21:24:25
OF THE LONG HOURS THAT I'VE 


[Captioner] 21:24:29
SPENT THERE AS A PARENT AND ONCE 


[Captioner] 21:24:32
YOUR CHILD IS A MEMBER OF 


[Captioner] 21:24:33
PLAYING SPORTS THAT YOU STAND IN 


[Captioner] 21:24:34
LINE.


[Captioner] 21:24:36
AND WE HAVE SOME OF THE AAU 


[Captioner] 21:24:38
CLUBS THAT WE WOULD STAND IN 


[Captioner] 21:24:41
LINE TWO OR 3:00 WE WOULD TAKE 


[Captioner] 21:24:42
SHIFTS EVERY THREE HOURS JUST SO 


[Captioner] 21:24:44
WE WOULD HAVE THE FIRST SPOT TO 


[Captioner] 21:24:47
CLAIM AS A SPOT TO PLAY ON YOUR 


[Captioner] 21:24:50
INSIDE BASKETBALL COURTS OR 


[Captioner] 21:24:51
VOLLEYBALL COURTS THERE IN 


[Captioner] 21:24:52
IRVINGTON COMMUNITY CENTER.


[Captioner] 21:24:54
SO I KNOW FIRSTHAND THAT WE'RE 


[Captioner] 21:24:56
LIVING WITH A VERY BAD SHORTAGE 


[Captioner] 21:24:57
THERE.


[Captioner] 21:25:00
AND FOR THE LOVE OF OUR KIDS, WE 


[Captioner] 21:25:02
STOOD IN LINE TO MAKE SURE THEY 


[Captioner] 21:25:03
HAD A SPOT AND THEY HAD A 


[Captioner] 21:25:06
SCHEDULE TO PLAY ON A REGULAR 


[Captioner] 21:25:07
BASIS, WHETHER IT'S PLAY THE 


[Captioner] 21:25:09
GAMES OR JUST PRACTICE.


[Captioner] 21:25:11
AND I WOULD CERTAINLY WELCOME 


[Captioner] 21:25:12
HAVING A NEW COMMUNITY CENTER 


[Captioner] 21:25:15
THERE BASED ON MY OWN PERSONAL 


[Captioner] 21:25:17
EXPERIENCES OVER THE YEARS.


[Captioner] 21:25:20
BUT I THINK THAT WOULD BE A 


[Captioner] 21:25:22
DEFINITE WIN-WIN FOR THE 


[Captioner] 21:25:23
COMMUNITY, AND ESPECIALLY 


[Captioner] 21:25:25
PUTTING IT IN CENTRAL PARK, IT'S 


[Captioner] 21:25:28
CENTRALLY LOCATED, YOU HAVE ALL 


[Captioner] 21:25:30
THE OTHER OUTDOOR ACTIVITIES AND 


[Captioner] 21:25:31
FUN AND BEAUTIFUL LAKE AND 


[Captioner] 21:25:33
BEAUTIFUL VIEW THAT MAKES 


[Captioner] 21:25:34
FREMONT SUCH A BEAUTIFUL PLACE 


[Captioner] 21:25:37
TO LIVE, WORK AND PLAY.


[Captioner] 21:25:39
AND SO I THINK THOSE THINGS ARE 


[Captioner] 21:25:41
ALSO THINGS TO ALSO SEE HOW WE 


[Captioner] 21:25:43
CAN KIND OF MOVE AROUND THAT.


[Captioner] 21:25:44
BECAUSE IT'S REALLY WHEN YOU 


[Captioner] 21:25:46
LOOK AT THIS, I KNOW THE 


[Captioner] 21:25:47
INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE HEALTH 


[Captioner] 21:25:48
AND SAFETY IS VERY IMPORTANT.


[Captioner] 21:25:50
BUT I ALSO WANT TO TRY TO 


[Captioner] 21:25:52
BALANCE IT WITH WHAT'S THE 


[Captioner] 21:25:53
COMMUNITY BENEFITS?


[Captioner] 21:25:55
WHAT IS THE COMMUNITY GET AS 


[Captioner] 21:25:56
THAT BALANCE OF THE BENEFIT THAT 


[Captioner] 21:25:58
THEY CAN SEE?


[Captioner] 21:26:02
WE PAY OUR TAXES, WE LIVED HERE 


[Captioner] 21:26:03
IN FREMONT, WHAT ARE WE GETTING 


[Captioner] 21:26:04
FROM THE CITY.


[Captioner] 21:26:05
AND SOME OF THE BENEFITS THERE.


[Captioner] 21:26:07
I MEAN SURE THE BATHROOMS, I'M 


[Captioner] 21:26:08
NOT GOING TO LIE.


[Captioner] 21:26:11
WE NEED THOSE BADLY.


[Captioner] 21:26:13
WE BADLY NEED THOSE UPGRADES TO 


[Captioner] 21:26:16
THE HILT.


[Captioner] 21:26:17
SO -- BUT I THINK THERE'S SOME 


[Captioner] 21:26:19
WAY THAT IF, YOU KNOW, I DON'T 


[Captioner] 21:26:21
KNOW ENTIRELY BUT, YOU KNOW, THE 


[Captioner] 21:26:24
SPORTS FIELD LIGHTING, THAT IS A 


[Captioner] 21:26:25
DEFINITE AREA THAT DEFINITELY 


[Captioner] 21:26:27
YOU CAN GET THE LED LIGHTING, TO 


[Captioner] 21:26:30
BE MORE ENERGY EFFICIENT, AND 


[Captioner] 21:26:32
YOU WERE SAYING SOMETHING WITH 


[Captioner] 21:26:37
THE TRANSFORMER AND IF YOU DON'T 


[Captioner] 21:26:38
HAVE THOSE TIED TOGETHER THEY 


[Captioner] 21:26:41
WON'T WORK TOGETHER AND THE 


[Captioner] 21:26:43
TECHNOLOGY AND ENERGY SAVINGS 


[Captioner] 21:26:45
AND EFFICIENCY WILL BE LACKING.


[Captioner] 21:26:47
SO IT KIND OF COMES AS A 


[Captioner] 21:26:48
COMBINED PACKAGE THERE.


[Captioner] 21:26:50
BUT I KNOW LOTS OF PEOPLE WOULD 


[Captioner] 21:26:54
STILL CONTINUE TO PLAY SPORTS 


[Captioner] 21:26:56
12:00 AT NIGHT THEY HAVE FULL 


[Captioner] 21:26:59
TIME JOBS, I KNOW FIRSTHAND OF 


[Captioner] 21:27:00
GOING TO SOME OF THOSE 


[Captioner] 21:27:02
TOURNAMENTS OR SOMETHING AT 


[Captioner] 21:27:04
MIDNIGHT OR 11:00 THEY DO THOSE 


[Captioner] 21:27:06
DIFFERENT PLAYS JUST TO ENJOY 


[Captioner] 21:27:08
OUTSIDE AND THAT IS THE SPACE 


[Captioner] 21:27:10
THEY CAN ENJOY AT THAT TIME OF 


[Captioner] 21:27:11
NIGHT.


[Captioner] 21:27:13
I'M JUST THINKING SOME OF THE 


[Captioner] 21:27:14
THINGS THAT ARE IMPORTANT THAT 


[Captioner] 21:27:15
WOULD BE REFLECTED IN THE 


[Captioner] 21:27:20
COMMUNITY TAKING ADVANTAGE OF 


[Captioner] 21:27:22
THIS DIFFERENT TYPE OF OUR 


[Captioner] 21:27:23
PRIORITIES AND SEEING HOW WE CAN 


[Captioner] 21:27:25
KIND OF DO A BALANCE THERE.


[Captioner] 21:27:27
AND ANY OTHER WAY WE CAN INCLUDE 


[Captioner] 21:27:29
MORE PEOPLE IS BETTER THAN LEST, 


[Captioner] 21:27:31
I KNOW IT'S IMPORTANT BUT THEIR 


[Captioner] 21:27:32
EMPLOYEES AND EVERYTHING THEY'RE 


[Captioner] 21:27:34
SAFE HERE AND THE ROOF DOESN'T 


[Captioner] 21:27:37
CAVE IN UNFORTUNATELY NOT AT 


[Captioner] 21:27:40
THAT COFFEE, STARBUCKS OR PIZZA, 


[Captioner] 21:27:42
I CAN'T REMEMBER, UNFORTUNATELY 


[Captioner] 21:27:43
THAT HAPPENED WITH THAT 


[Captioner] 21:27:43
EMPLOYEE.


[Captioner] 21:27:45
SO WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT 


[Captioner] 21:27:47
EVERYBODY IS SAFE AND WORKING 


[Captioner] 21:27:49
HERE, FOR THE CITY, AND ALL OF 


[Captioner] 21:27:51
OUR COMMUNITY AS WELL.


[Captioner] 21:27:53
SO I KNOW IT'S A HARD BALANCE.


[Captioner] 21:27:55
AND I CAN TELL YOU FIRSTHAND 


[Captioner] 21:27:57
THAT HVAC SYSTEMS, THOSE REALLY 


[Captioner] 21:27:58
NEED TO GO.


[Captioner] 21:28:01
BECAUSE THE MORE THAT THEY GET 


[Captioner] 21:28:02
REPLACED THE HARDER THE PARTS 


[Captioner] 21:28:04
ARE THAT YOU CAN FIND, AND BE A 


[Captioner] 21:28:06
PART THAT YOU'LL BE TOTALLY 


[Captioner] 21:28:07
DOWN, AND IT COULD BE EITHER 


[Captioner] 21:28:09
COLD OR IT COULD BE HOT, 


[Captioner] 21:28:11
DEPENDING ON THE TIMING.


[Captioner] 21:28:14
AND I'VE LIVED THAT FIRSTHAND.


[Captioner] 21:28:16
I'VE HAD TO OVERREPLACE IT 


[Captioner] 21:28:17
IMMEDIATELY.


[Captioner] 21:28:19
AND SOONER WAS BETTER THAN 


[Captioner] 21:28:19
LATER.


[Captioner] 21:28:21
BECAUSE IT'S JUST WHEN IT GETS 


[Captioner] 21:28:26
TO THE POINT OF FREON THERE'S 


[Captioner] 21:28:28
NOT A LOT OF OTHER PARTS THAT GO 


[Captioner] 21:28:31
WITH IT, THE OUTDATED 


[Captioner] 21:28:34
TECHNOLOGY, YOU'RE NOT RUNNING 


[Captioner] 21:28:35
EFFICIENCY, THAT WE CAN GET 


[Captioner] 21:28:37
CREDITS, BUYING IT AS A HUGE 


[Captioner] 21:28:39
UNIT WE CAN GET ENERGY CREDITS 


[Captioner] 21:28:41
THAT WOULD COUNT BACK TO REDUCE 


[Captioner] 21:28:43
THE BILL ON THE EQUIPMENT THERE.


[Captioner] 21:28:46
AND I JUST WANT TO MENTION ABOUT 


[Captioner] 21:28:48
THE VEHICLE EVIDENCE STORAGE, 


[Captioner] 21:28:50
THAT IS REALLY CRITICAL, 


[Captioner] 21:28:52
ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE A PERSON 


[Captioner] 21:28:54
THAT IS A VICTIM, THAT YOU NEED 


[Captioner] 21:29:00
TO HAVE THAT AREA LEFT FOR 


[Captioner] 21:29:06
PROPER LAWSUIT AND DUE DILIGENCE 


[Captioner] 21:29:06
TO OCCUR THERE.


[Captioner] 21:29:08
AND I KNOW THAT IT'S IMPORTANT 


[Captioner] 21:29:10
TO BE ABLE TO HAVE SOME EXTRA 


[Captioner] 21:29:12
SPACE THERE FOR THAT AREA.


[Captioner] 21:29:15
I WAS TRYING TO THINK OF 


[Captioner] 21:29:16
ANYTHING ELSE?


[Captioner] 21:29:17
I THINK -- BUT I APPRECIATE ALL 


[Captioner] 21:29:19
THAT YOU'RE DOING AND ESPECIALLY 


[Captioner] 21:29:21
THE DOGS, THE ANIMAL LOVERS OUT 


[Captioner] 21:29:21
THERE.


[Captioner] 21:29:24
AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE 


[Captioner] 21:29:25
SAFE AS THEY'RE RUNNING AROUND 


[Captioner] 21:29:27
WITH THEIR DOGS.


[Captioner] 21:29:28
AND LIKE WE HAD ALREADY APPROVED 


[Captioner] 21:29:32
OVER A YEAR OR SO AGO, ABOUT THE 


[Captioner] 21:29:33
PARK MASTER PLAN, HOW IMPORTANT 


[Captioner] 21:29:35
IT IS TO BE TEN MINUTES AWAY.


[Captioner] 21:29:36
AND THAT WALKING DOES MAKE A 


[Captioner] 21:29:37
DIFFERENCE.


[Captioner] 21:29:39
AND IT'S ALSO PART OF MENTAL 


[Captioner] 21:29:40
HEALTH AND BEING OUT THERE 


[Captioner] 21:29:42
BECAUSE THERE'S STUDIES THAT 


[Captioner] 21:29:43
TALK ABOUT THE WELLNESS WHEN 


[Captioner] 21:29:44
WE'RE OUT IN NATURE.


[Captioner] 21:29:46
SO I THINK THAT, YOU KNOW, EVEN 


[Captioner] 21:29:48
THE DOG PARK, SO I WOULD SAY THE 


[Captioner] 21:29:50
MAJORITY OF THINGS YOU HAVE IN 


[Captioner] 21:29:51
THE URGENT PRIORITY ARE STILL 


[Captioner] 21:29:52
IMPORTANT.


[Captioner] 21:29:53
BUT WE NEED TO FIND A LITTLE 


[Captioner] 21:29:56
MORE ROOM TO INCLUDE SOME OF 


[Captioner] 21:29:58
THOSE COMMUNITY CENTER THAT WE 


[Captioner] 21:29:59
COULD BRING FORTH.


[Captioner] 21:30:00
TO KIND OF MATCH WITH THE 


[Captioner] 21:30:02
COMMUNITY, AS WELL AS THE 


[Captioner] 21:30:06
REBRANDING OF OUR NEW MEDIUM.


[Captioner] 21:30:08
OUR MEDIUM BEAUTIFICATION, THAT 


[Captioner] 21:30:11
COULD COME ALONG THERE TO HELP 


[Captioner] 21:30:14
US PARTNER TOGETHER WITH A SMALL 


[Captioner] 21:30:16
BUSINESS OR BIG BUSINESS AND 


[Captioner] 21:30:17
KIND OF WORK IT OUT THERE.


[Captioner] 21:30:18
SO THANK YOU SO MUCH.


[Captioner] 21:30:20
AND ALSO, DON'T FORGET ABOUT 


[Captioner] 21:30:22
THAT RESOURCING TOO.


[Captioner] 21:30:24
TAKING ADVANTAGE OF REPURCHASING 


[Captioner] 21:30:27
AND THE PAY-BACKING OPTIONS THAT 


[Captioner] 21:30:28
ARE OUT THERE.


[Captioner] 21:30:28
THANK YOU.

>> The Clerk:   COUNCILMEMBER 


[Captioner] 21:30:33
SHAO FOLLOWED BY COUNCILMEMBER 


[Captioner] 21:30:33
CAMPBELL.


[Captioner] 21:30:37
>> Councilmember Shao:   I 


[Captioner] 21:30:44
CERTAINLY ECHO WITH 


[Captioner] 21:30:47
COUNCILMEMBER RAJ SALWAN AND 


[Captioner] 21:30:49
COUNCILMEMBER COX ON THE HVAC 


[Captioner] 21:30:49
PART.


[Captioner] 21:30:53
BASED ON MY EXPERIENCE ON THE 


[Captioner] 21:30:55
SCHOOL BOARD MEASURE E WITH ALL 


[Captioner] 21:30:59
THE HVAC PROJECTS, THOSE UNITS 


[Captioner] 21:31:01
COULD BE COSTLY CONSIDERING THEY 


[Captioner] 21:31:03
ARE OUT OF DATE, HARD TO 


[Captioner] 21:31:03
REPLACE.


[Captioner] 21:31:05
AND THE SOONER WE TAKE ACTIONS 


[Captioner] 21:31:06
ON THEM THE BETTER.


[Captioner] 21:31:11
SO I CERTAINLY ECHO THAT.


[Captioner] 21:31:13
ON THE SCHOOL DISTRICT WE USED 


[Captioner] 21:31:15
TO SPEND A LOT OF TIME TALKING 


[Captioner] 21:31:17
ABOUT TOILETS AND BATHROOMS.


[Captioner] 21:31:20
BUT, YOU KNOW, I'M GLAD THAT 


[Captioner] 21:31:22
IT'S COVERED HERE.


[Captioner] 21:31:26
FOR THE AUTO MALL PARKWAY 


[Captioner] 21:31:33
CORRIDOR, I CONCUR WITH PREVIOUS 


[Captioner] 21:31:35
SPEAKERS AND MY FELLOW 


[Captioner] 21:31:36
COUNCILMEMBERS.


[Captioner] 21:31:39
UNLESS, I NOTICE THAT PARTLY 


[Captioner] 21:31:40
THAT THE MEDIAN WAS 


[Captioner] 21:31:41
DIRECTORIALLY UNDERNEATH THE 


[Captioner] 21:31:45
HIGH VOLTAGE POWER LINE TOWERS.


[Captioner] 21:31:50
UNLESS THAT WAS SOME U.C. LIKE 


[Captioner] 21:31:55
, YOU KNOW, 


[Captioner] 21:31:58
JURISDICTION LIKE EASEMENT, WE 


[Captioner] 21:32:01
PROBABLY CAN'T GET ACCESS.


[Captioner] 21:32:02
I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO SEE THAT 


[Captioner] 21:32:04
PART GETTING APPROVED.


[Captioner] 21:32:06
FOR THE QUIET ZONES, I HOPE THAT 


[Captioner] 21:32:09
WE CAN LEARN FROM OUR PAST 


[Captioner] 21:32:11
EXPERIENCE, AND THEN WORK WITH 


[Captioner] 21:32:14
OTHER JURISDICTIONS OR AUTHORITY 


[Captioner] 21:32:17
OR AGENCIES TO SPEED UP THE WORK 


[Captioner] 21:32:21
ON THE SIX LOCATIONS IN 


[Captioner] 21:32:22
CENTERVILLE.


[Captioner] 21:32:24
THEN WE CAN TURN AROUND AND THEN 


[Captioner] 21:32:26
JUST CONTINUE TO WORK ON OTHER 


[Captioner] 21:32:28
PARTS OF THE CITY.


[Captioner] 21:32:30
THAT'S THE PART THAT I GOT A LOT 


[Captioner] 21:32:33
OF COMPLAINTS ABOUT.


[Captioner] 21:32:37
THEN LAST BUT NOT LEAST, YOU 


[Captioner] 21:32:39
KNOW, FOR -- I'M VERY GLAD THAT 


[Captioner] 21:32:44
WE PUT THE TEENAGE -- THE TEEN 


[Captioner] 21:32:47
CENTER DEMOLITION AND 


[Captioner] 21:32:48
REPLACEMENT AND CONSTRUCTION OF 


[Captioner] 21:32:52
THE NEW COMMUNITY CENTER AT 


[Captioner] 21:32:55
CENTRAL PARK AS THE HIGHEST 


[Captioner] 21:32:58
PRIORITY.


[Captioner] 21:33:00
AND FOR THE SHORTAGE OF FUNDING, 


[Captioner] 21:33:02
YOU KNOW, I ENCOURAGE THAT WE 


[Captioner] 21:33:05
ALL BECOME CREATIVE, THINKING 


[Captioner] 21:33:09
OUT OF THE BOX, AND MAYBE TRY TO 


[Captioner] 21:33:12
FOR EXAMPLE SELL NAMING RIGHTS 


[Captioner] 21:33:15
TO SOME PEOPLE WHO HAVE DEEP 


[Captioner] 21:33:21
POCKETS, LIKE ELON MUSK, TO 


[Captioner] 21:33:23
RAISE MONEY TO GET IT DONE 


[Captioner] 21:33:23
QUICKLY.


[Captioner] 21:33:25
BECAUSE EVERY TIME I DRIVE BY 


[Captioner] 21:33:26
THAT AREA I NOTICE THAT THE 


[Captioner] 21:33:28
NUMBER OF TENTS ARE GETTING MORE 


[Captioner] 21:33:31
AND MORE.


[Captioner] 21:33:35
AND IT BECAME MORE AND MORE OF A 


[Captioner] 21:33:38
FAVORITE ENCAMPMENT SITE.


[Captioner] 21:33:40
SO WITH THE DEMOLITION AND 


[Captioner] 21:33:41
CONSTRUCTION AND, YOU KNOW, 


[Captioner] 21:33:45
BASICALLY THE CHANGE OF THAT 


[Captioner] 21:33:49
REGION IN GENERAL, I BELIEVE WE 


[Captioner] 21:33:51
CAN BEAUTIFY THE CENTRAL PARK 


[Captioner] 21:33:52
GREATLY.


[Captioner] 21:33:53
THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SAY.


[Captioner] 21:33:57
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 21:33:58
>> The Clerk:   COUNCILMEMBER 


[Captioner] 21:33:59
CAMPBELL.


[Captioner] 21:33:59
>> Councilmember Campbell:   I 


[Captioner] 21:34:02
JUST HAVE ONE OR TWO.


[Captioner] 21:34:04
I REALLY CONCUR WITH THE TEEN 


[Captioner] 21:34:04
CENTER.


[Captioner] 21:34:06
I KNOW THAT WAS ONE OF THE 


[Captioner] 21:34:07
THINGS THAT WE HAD TALKED ABOUT 


[Captioner] 21:34:09
BEFORE, HAVING SOME PLACE FOR 


[Captioner] 21:34:11
TEENS TO GO AND SOME ACTIVITIES 


[Captioner] 21:34:14
FOR THEM TO ACTUALLY DO.


[Captioner] 21:34:19
SO BEEFING UP THE TEEN CENTER 


[Captioner] 21:34:20
WOULD BE GREAT.


[Captioner] 21:34:21
ALSO BATHROOMS ARE VERY, VERY 


[Captioner] 21:34:22
IMPORTANT.


[Captioner] 21:34:25
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T ATTRACT PEOPLE 


[Captioner] 21:34:28
TO COME TO THE PARK IF THE 


[Captioner] 21:34:29
BATHROOMS ARE NOT NICE.


[Captioner] 21:34:30
I THINK THAT SHOULD BE ONE OF 


[Captioner] 21:34:31
OUR PRIORITIES.


[Captioner] 21:34:33
I HEARD ONE OF THE COMMUNITY 


[Captioner] 21:34:35
MEMBERS TALK ABOUT DECOTO ROAD 


[Captioner] 21:34:37
OFF OF PASEO PADRE, BETWEEN 


[Captioner] 21:34:39
DECOTO AND ISHERWOOD.


[Captioner] 21:34:40
THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS WRONG 


[Captioner] 21:34:42
WITH THAT ROAD RIGHT THERE, 


[Captioner] 21:34:44
FIRST OF ALL IT'S LIKE THE 


[Captioner] 21:34:45
SUPERHIGHWAY, PEOPLE ARE 


[Captioner] 21:34:45
SPEEDING.


[Captioner] 21:34:47
I KNOW THEY CHANGED THE SPEED 


[Captioner] 21:34:50
LIMIT BETWEEN THAT SORT OF THAT 


[Captioner] 21:34:52
STRETCH, USED TO BE LIKE I THINK 


[Captioner] 21:34:54
IT WAS 50 MILES AN HOUR AND THEN 


[Captioner] 21:34:56
THEY PUT IT DOWN TO 45, NOW IT'S 


[Captioner] 21:34:58
DOWN TO 40, BUT PEOPLE ARE DOING 


[Captioner] 21:34:59
60 AROUND THAT BEND.


[Captioner] 21:35:01
SO THAT'S A REAL PROBLEM WITH 


[Captioner] 21:35:02
THE SPEED.


[Captioner] 21:35:04
AND THEN THEY HAVE SCHOOLS THAT 


[Captioner] 21:35:06
CROSS DOWN THROUGH THERE.


[Captioner] 21:35:07
SO THAT WOULD BE GREAT IF WE 


[Captioner] 21:35:10
COULD DO SOMETHING FOR THAT 


[Captioner] 21:35:11
LITTLE STRETCH RIGHT THERE.


[Captioner] 21:35:15
AND THEN I CONCUR WITH THE AUTO 


[Captioner] 21:35:18
MALL PARKWAY AT GRIMMER AND 


[Captioner] 21:35:19
FREMONT BOULEVARD USED TO GO TO 


[Captioner] 21:35:21
THE SCHOOL DISTRICT.


[Captioner] 21:35:22
THE SCHOOL DISTRICT IS AT 


[Captioner] 21:35:23
TECHNOLOGY AND RIGHT THERE AT 


[Captioner] 21:35:25
THAT LITTLE LIGHT BETWEEN -- 


[Captioner] 21:35:27
AFTER YOU GET THE FREMONT AND 


[Captioner] 21:35:30
THEN TO TECHNOLOGY IT IS JUST A 


[Captioner] 21:35:32
BUNCH OF TRASH IS ALWAYS THERE.


[Captioner] 21:35:34
IT'S JUST REALLY -- I DON'T KNOW 


[Captioner] 21:35:35
IF PEOPLE JUST THROW STUFF OUT 


[Captioner] 21:35:38
OF THE CAR, OUT OF THEIR WINDOW, 


[Captioner] 21:35:40
BUT IT'S ALWAYS A LOT, A LOT OF 


[Captioner] 21:35:42
TRASH IN THAT ONE LITTLE AREA 


[Captioner] 21:35:42
THERE.


[Captioner] 21:35:44
SO I CONCUR WITH THAT.


[Captioner] 21:35:45
AND THEN I JUST HAVE ONE OTHER 


[Captioner] 21:35:46
QUESTION ABOUT THE DEFERRED 


[Captioner] 21:35:47
MAINTENANCE THAT WE TALKED ABOUT 


[Captioner] 21:35:50
EARLIER.


[Captioner] 21:35:52
FOR THE SCHOOL DISTRICT THEY SET 


[Captioner] 21:35:54
ASIDE A PART OF THEIR BUDGET, I 


[Captioner] 21:35:56
DON'T KNOW, 2% OF THE BUDGET 


[Captioner] 21:35:58
GOES INTO DEFERRED MAINTENANCE 


[Captioner] 21:35:59
EVERY SINGLE YEAR.


[Captioner] 21:36:01
I MEAN THAT'S -- I GUESS THAT 


[Captioner] 21:36:03
WOULDN'T BE SIMILAR TO THE $5 


[Captioner] 21:36:05
MILLION AND THE $7 MILLION THAT 


[Captioner] 21:36:08
YOU PUT FOR CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT 


[Captioner] 21:36:09
PROJECTS.


[Captioner] 21:36:11
BUT SPECIFICALLY SET ASIDE FOR 


[Captioner] 21:36:15
 


[Captioner] 21:36:16
DEFERRED MAINTENANCE TO HELP US 


[Captioner] 21:36:19
WITH SOME OF THESE ONGOING COSTS 


[Captioner] 21:36:20
TO HELP US WITH SUSTAINABILITY 


[Captioner] 21:36:22
BACK TO THAT POINT WITH ME.


[Captioner] 21:36:25
SO THAT'S ALL I HAVE FOR NOW.


[Captioner] 21:36:27
THANK YOU SO MUCH, I'M SURE WHEN

>> Mayor Mei:   OKAY, GREAT.


[Captioner] 21:37:08
SO I WAS JUST SAYING EARLIER 


[Captioner] 21:37:10
THAT WHEN I CAME ON WE MADE A 


[Captioner] 21:37:12
PLEDGE FOR A TEN-MINUTE WALKING 


[Captioner] 21:37:13
ABILITY FOR OUR COMMUNITY 


[Captioner] 21:37:15
MEMBERS AND IT WAS GREAT TO BE 


[Captioner] 21:37:17
ABLE TO UPDATE THE 25 YEARS -- 


[Captioner] 21:37:20
25 YEARS -- WE HADN'T UPDATED 


[Captioner] 21:37:22
THE MASTER PLAN PARK PLAN TO GET 


[Captioner] 21:37:22
AT A DONE.


[Captioner] 21:37:24
I KNOW WE COMMITTED TO DOING IT 


[Captioner] 21:37:26
MORE REGULARLY SUBSEQUENT AND 


[Captioner] 21:37:28
ALSO OUR MASTER TRAIL PLAN.


[Captioner] 21:37:30
WE WOULD BE UPDATING AND LOOKING 


[Captioner] 21:37:33
AT OUR BIEK-PED PLAN, WE HOPE 


[Captioner] 21:37:34
THE PEOPLE WILL CONTINUE TO 


[Captioner] 21:37:35
PARTICIPATE.


[Captioner] 21:37:37
AS PART OF OUR MOBILITY ACTION 


[Captioner] 21:37:40
PLAN BACK THEN IT WAS FIVE 


[Captioner] 21:37:42
YEARS, AND HOPEFULLY PEOPLE WILL 


[Captioner] 21:37:43
TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION SOME OF 


[Captioner] 21:37:43
THE THINGS.


[Captioner] 21:37:45
A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT HAPPENED 


[Captioner] 21:37:49
SINCE THEN I KNOW COUNCILMEMBER 


[Captioner] 21:37:50
SALWAN MENTIONED THE ABILITY TO 


[Captioner] 21:37:53
GET THINGS DONE AND I WANT TO 


[Captioner] 21:37:57
THANK PUBLIC WORKS STAFF, FOR 


[Captioner] 21:38:00
UPDATING EVERY SINGLE LIGHT TO 


[Captioner] 21:38:02
MOVE TO THE STREET LIGHTS TO 


[Captioner] 21:38:03
LED.


[Captioner] 21:38:05
I'D LIKE TO THINK WHEN WE MOVE 


[Captioner] 21:38:06
TOWARDS FUTURE INITIATIVES 


[Captioner] 21:38:08
WHETHER IT IS LIGHTING OR IN 


[Captioner] 21:38:09
TERMS OF THE PARKS, THAT WE LOOK 


[Captioner] 21:38:12
AT ALL THE POSSIBLE 


[Captioner] 21:38:13
ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS THAT WOULD 


[Captioner] 21:38:15
BE MORE ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY 


[Captioner] 21:38:18
SUCH AS THE PARKS USING MORE 


[Captioner] 21:38:21
SOLAR OPTIONS IN TERMS OF SAVING 


[Captioner] 21:38:22
OUR BILLING THERE.


[Captioner] 21:38:24
I KNOW SOME OF THE LIGHTS THAT 


[Captioner] 21:38:27
WE'VE IMPLEMENTED SINCE SUCH AS 


[Captioner] 21:38:29
THOSE FOR TRAFFIC SIGNALING ARE 


[Captioner] 21:38:31
NOW USING SOLAR TO POWER IT.


[Captioner] 21:38:33
I ALSO THINK FOR THE RESTROOMS 


[Captioner] 21:38:35
THAT I'VE SEEN A LOT OF 


[Captioner] 21:38:37
DIFFERENT DEMONSTRATIONS OF TYPE 


[Captioner] 21:38:39
OF RESTROOMS THAT WOULD BE MORE 


[Captioner] 21:38:42
 


[Captioner] 21:38:44
HYGIENIC AND EASIER TO CLEAN.


[Captioner] 21:38:46
I KNOW SOME OF OUR PARKS TEAMS 


[Captioner] 21:38:48
HAVE TAKEN A LOOK AT THOSE WHEN 


[Captioner] 21:38:50
THEY GO OUT TO THEIR COMMUNITY 


[Captioner] 21:38:51
MEETINGS OR TRADE SHOWS TO LOOK 


[Captioner] 21:38:53
AT THAT.


[Captioner] 21:38:55
THERE ARE WAYS TO MAKE IT MORE 


[Captioner] 21:38:56
EFFICIENT AND SANITARY AND 


[Captioner] 21:38:57
HELPFUL THIS THAT AREA.


[Captioner] 21:38:59
REGARDING THE COMMENTS ABOUT THE 


[Captioner] 21:39:00
COMMUNITY CENTERS, I DEFINITELY 


[Captioner] 21:39:02
AM EXCITED AND THINK IT'S 


[Captioner] 21:39:05
IMPORTANT FOR US TO PROVIDE A 


[Captioner] 21:39:07
MORE MODERN TEEN AND COMMUNITY 


[Captioner] 21:39:09
CENTER AND I WOULD ECHO 


[Captioner] 21:39:10
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN'S INTEREST 


[Captioner] 21:39:13
IN TRYING TO MAKE IT MORE OF A 


[Captioner] 21:39:15
CAPACITY BECAUSE THERE IS 


[Captioner] 21:39:16
DEFINITELY MUCH MORE NEED OF 


[Captioner] 21:39:17
THAT.


[Captioner] 21:39:19
HAVING BEEN TO MANY OF THOSE 


[Captioner] 21:39:21
BASEBALL AND BASKETBALL AND 


[Captioner] 21:39:23
OTHER SPORTS SINCE MY KIDS WERE 


[Captioner] 21:39:24
LITTLE OVER AT THE IRVINGTON 


[Captioner] 21:39:25
COMMUNITY CENTER IT IS WELL 


[Captioner] 21:39:28
LOVED AND WELL USED, BEING ABLE 


[Captioner] 21:39:30
TO PROVIDE MORE CAPACITY IS 


[Captioner] 21:39:32
HELPFUL, AS WE PARTNER WITH 


[Captioner] 21:39:35
WASHINGTON HOSPITAL, TO THE 


[Captioner] 21:39:37
CONCERNS WITH PHYSICAL HEALTH, 


[Captioner] 21:39:39
MENTAL HEALTH, ESPECIALLY IN THE 


[Captioner] 21:39:41
LAST COUPLE OF YEARS, MAKING 


[Captioner] 21:39:42
SURE WE HAVE THE CHILDREN AND 


[Captioner] 21:39:44
OUR ELDERS WHO HAVE ACCESS TO 


[Captioner] 21:39:46
FACILITIES.


[Captioner] 21:39:48
REGARDING THE AUTO MALL, ONE OF 


[Captioner] 21:39:50
THE CHALLENGES WE HAVE AS A CITY 


[Captioner] 21:39:52
THAT NOT ALWAYS PEOPLE IN THE 


[Captioner] 21:39:54
PUBLIC REALIZE IS THAT SHORT OF 


[Captioner] 21:39:55
ONLY SAN JOSE WE ARE THE SECOND 


[Captioner] 21:39:58
LARGEST CITY IN LAND SIZE IN THE 


[Captioner] 21:39:59
WHOLE BAY AREA.


[Captioner] 21:40:01
WHICH MEANS WE HAVE MANY ROADS 


[Captioner] 21:40:03
TO WORK ON AND IT IS A CONSTANT 


[Captioner] 21:40:03
CHALLENGE.


[Captioner] 21:40:05
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAS 


[Captioner] 21:40:08
HAPPENED IN THE PAST IS WHEN WE 


[Captioner] 21:40:09
UPDATE A STREET AT THE SAME TIME 


[Captioner] 21:40:10
OR THERE'S CONSTRUCTION FOR NEW 


[Captioner] 21:40:11
BUILDINGS THAT IS SOMETHING THAT 


[Captioner] 21:40:13
WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO HAVE PEOPLE 


[Captioner] 21:40:14
PARTICIPATE IN.


[Captioner] 21:40:17
WE TALKED EARLIER TONIGHT ABOUT 


[Captioner] 21:40:18
THE LANDSCAPING DISTRICT 


[Captioner] 21:40:20
ASSESSMENT FEE WHICH CAME UP 


[Captioner] 21:40:22
WITH ZONE 88 WHICH IS THE 


[Captioner] 21:40:23
SPECIAL AREA AND THAT IS 


[Captioner] 21:40:24
SOMETHING THAT POSSIBLY WE WOULD 


[Captioner] 21:40:26
WANT TO WORK ON, WE CAN DO THE 


[Captioner] 21:40:28
CARROT AND STICK ONE IS 


[Captioner] 21:40:29
ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO 


[Captioner] 21:40:30
PARTICIPATE.


[Captioner] 21:40:31
THE SCHOOL DISTRICT THERE WOULD 


[Captioner] 21:40:33
MAKE A GREAT PROJECT MAYBE OR 


[Captioner] 21:40:34
THE STUDENTS TO HELP US WITH 


[Captioner] 21:40:36
DESIGN OR -- WORKING WITH OUR I 


[Captioner] 21:40:39
LIKE THE IDEA OF ADOPT A MEDIAN.


[Captioner] 21:40:41
BUT I THINK THAT ALSO THERE 


[Captioner] 21:40:44
THERE'S GAS STATIONS, THERE'S 


[Captioner] 21:40:46
THE MOBILE HOME PARK, OTHER 


[Captioner] 21:40:49
BUSINESSES THERE, PART OF IT IS 


[Captioner] 21:40:50
WE'RE PARTNERS, WE WANT TO YOU 


[Captioner] 21:40:52
HELP US BUILD OUR COMMUNITY.


[Captioner] 21:40:54
IT DOESN'T LIE ON THE CITY ALONE 


[Captioner] 21:40:57
TO BEAUTIFY THAT COMMUNITY AREA.


[Captioner] 21:40:59
I LOVE THE IDEA OF ASKING PEOPLE 


[Captioner] 21:41:01
TO STEP UP TO ASK IF THEY WANT 


[Captioner] 21:41:03
TO HELP ADOPT THE AREA.


[Captioner] 21:41:05
WE HAVE MULTIPLE PEOPLE WHO 


[Captioner] 21:41:08
AHAVE THAT RIGHT-OF-WAY, AC 


[Captioner] 21:41:10
TRANSIT, THE AREA WHERE THE 


[Captioner] 21:41:11
POWER TENSION LINES ARE SO 


[Captioner] 21:41:16
WORKING WITH THOSE ENTITIES, 


[Captioner] 21:41:17
HELPING OUT.


[Captioner] 21:41:19
IF PEOPLE WANT TO SEE THE 


[Captioner] 21:41:20
CHANGE, IT IS NOT JUST CALLING 


[Captioner] 21:41:22
US AND ASKING IF WE WANT TO 


[Captioner] 21:41:24
ADOPT THE DISTRICT, WE WANT 


[Captioner] 21:41:26
BUSINESSES AND OTHERS TO HELP 


[Captioner] 21:41:29
STEP UP AND VOLUNTEER TO HELP 


[Captioner] 21:41:30
CONTRIBUTE TO THAT.


[Captioner] 21:41:31
IF THAT'S SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE 


[Captioner] 21:41:34
WANT TO, I MEAN THAT IS THE LAND 


[Captioner] 21:41:35
ASSESSMENT LANDSCAPING FEE THAT 


[Captioner] 21:41:38
WE TALKED ABOUT EARLIER TONIGHT, 


[Captioner] 21:41:41
PEOPLE VOTED TO TAX THEM 


[Captioner] 21:41:43
SESTLES, THAT'S HOW YOU GOT THE 


[Captioner] 21:41:45
THAT FEE SO THAT IS ONE OF THE 


[Captioner] 21:41:46
OPTIONS.


[Captioner] 21:41:49
THAT IS IT IN DISCUSSION, I HOPE 


[Captioner] 21:41:50
PEOPLE WILL PARTICIPATE.


[Captioner] 21:41:53
FOR THOSE WHO WANT TO KNOW MORE 


[Captioner] 21:41:56
ABOUT THIS, WE HAVE OUR CAPITAL 


[Captioner] 21:41:58
IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM ON OUR 


[Captioner] 21:42:00
WEBSITE, IT IS 185 PAGES, IF YOU 


[Captioner] 21:42:03
WANT TO LOOK AT IT, IT GOES 


[Captioner] 21:42:04
THERE ALL PROJECTS.


[Captioner] 21:42:06
WE WILL TALK ABOUT SOMETHING 


[Captioner] 21:42:08
SIMILAR SINCE DEVELOPMENT IN 


[Captioner] 21:42:10
MAY, IT WILL BE ADOPTED BY US IN 


[Captioner] 21:42:13
JUNE TO BEGIN IN JULY.


[Captioner] 21:42:16
YOU CAN GO BACK TO 2021, 2019, 


[Captioner] 21:42:18
SOME OF PAST YEARS AND WHAT THE 


[Captioner] 21:42:20
THOUGHT PROCESSES WERE AND WHAT 


[Captioner] 21:42:21
PROJECTS HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED.


[Captioner] 21:42:23
I THINK SOMETIMES IT IS HARD FOR 


[Captioner] 21:42:25
PEOPLE TO SEE BECAUSE THERE ARE 


[Captioner] 21:42:26
SO MANY THINGS CHANGED OVER THE 


[Captioner] 21:42:28
YEARS TO SEE EXACTLY WHAT HAS 


[Captioner] 21:42:29
BEEN ADOPTED.


[Captioner] 21:42:30
THANK YOU FOR THE CONVERSATION, 


[Captioner] 21:42:32
THANK YOU TO STAFF AND ALL THE 


[Captioner] 21:42:34
COMMUNITY MEMBERS TO 


[Captioner] 21:42:34
PARTICIPATE.


[Captioner] 21:42:35
I'M VERY PLEASED TO KNOW THAT 


[Captioner] 21:42:37
THE COMMUNITY DID COME UP TO 


[Captioner] 21:42:38
SPEAK AND I'M SURE IN JUNE THEY 


[Captioner] 21:42:39
WILL ALSO PARTICIPATE.


[Captioner] 21:42:41
FOR THE ONE COMMENT FROM THE 


[Captioner] 21:42:43
PUBLIC MEMBER I KNOW SOME PEOPLE 


[Captioner] 21:42:44
HAD ASKED ABOUT THEIR 


[Captioner] 21:42:45
NEIGHBORHOODS.


[Captioner] 21:42:46
AND ESPECIALLY BEFORE 


[Captioner] 21:42:47
CONSTRUCTION STARTS.


[Captioner] 21:42:48
I DEFINITELY WOULD LOVE TO SEE 


[Captioner] 21:42:50
THAT WE DO OUTREACH.


[Captioner] 21:42:54
I AM ALSO VERY BIG ON TRYING TO 


[Captioner] 21:42:56
SAVE THE TREES AND I HEARD THE 


[Captioner] 21:42:57
COMMENT FROM COUNCILMEMBER 


[Captioner] 21:42:58
KASSAN AND I THINK IT'S 


[Captioner] 21:43:00
IMPORTANT FOR THE HEALTH AND 


[Captioner] 21:43:01
WELLNESS FOR THE ENVIRONMENT OF 


[Captioner] 21:43:03
THE COMMUNITY AND JUST FOR THE 


[Captioner] 21:43:06
BEAUTIFICATION IN GENERAL.


[Captioner] 21:43:08
SO THERE'S A 50-50 PROGRAM IF 


[Captioner] 21:43:09
PEOPLE WANT TO LOOK AT IT, IT 


[Captioner] 21:43:13
WAS IN OUR WEBSITE, I WAS GOING 


[Captioner] 21:43:14
TO PUT THE LINK IN THERE BUT 


[Captioner] 21:43:16
UNFORTUNATELY THE CHAT IS 
CLOSED.


[Captioner] 21:43:19
THERE IS A 50-50 PAGE ON OUR 


[Captioner] 21:43:20
WEBSITE FOR BOTH OUR SIDEWALKS 


[Captioner] 21:43:21
AND THE TREES.


[Captioner] 21:43:23
IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO GO THERE'S 


[Captioner] 21:43:25
A LIST OUT THERE IN TERMS OF HOW 


[Captioner] 21:43:27
TO GO OUT AND GET THE 


[Captioner] 21:43:27
REIMBURSEMENT.


[Captioner] 21:43:29
SO WOULD DEFINITELY LOVE PEOPLE 


[Captioner] 21:43:30
TO PARTICIPATE IN SUBMITTING.


[Captioner] 21:43:32
SO I THINK THAT'S IT FOR THIS 


[Captioner] 21:43:33
AGENDA ITEM.


[Captioner] 21:43:38
AND THIS IS A -- JUST A -- I 


[Captioner] 21:43:41
THINK HOPEFULLY HANS AND THE 


[Captioner] 21:43:44
TEAM WILL SAY THAT WE HAVE GIVEN 


[Captioner] 21:43:46
PLENTY OF FEEDBACK FOR WHEN WE 


[Captioner] 21:43:48
COME BACK FOR CONVERSATION AGAIN 


[Captioner] 21:43:50
IN MAY AND JUNE.


[Captioner] 21:43:53
NEXT ON OUR AGENDA ITEM IS ITEM 


[Captioner] 21:43:55
7A 1 WHICH IS COUNCILMEMBER 


[Captioner] 21:43:56
CAMPBELL REFERRAL.


[Captioner] 21:43:58
THE REQUEST TO UPDATE THE 


[Captioner] 21:44:01
FREMONT CITY COUNCIL HANDBOOK TO 


[Captioner] 21:44:03
INCLUDE ROSENBERG'S RULES OF 


[Captioner] 21:44:04
ORDER.


[Captioner] 21:44:05
I KNOW THAT THERE'S A REALLY 


[Captioner] 21:44:07
GOOD GUIDE ALSO THAT WAS 


[Captioner] 21:44:08
PROVIDED AS WELL AS TRAINING 


[Captioner] 21:44:09
FROM THE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA 


[Captioner] 21:44:10
CITIES AND I'LL LET HER 


[Captioner] 21:44:12
INTRODUCE THE TOPIC.


[Captioner] 21:44:13
PERHAPS THAT IS WHERE SHE HAD 


[Captioner] 21:44:16
THOUGHT ABOUT THIS AS WELL AS 


[Captioner] 21:44:18
FROM CSBA OVER THE YEARS.


[Captioner] 21:44:19
>> Councilmember Campbell:   


[Captioner] 21:44:22
THANK YOU, MAYOR MEI FOR THIS.


[Captioner] 21:44:24
I JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT, YOU 


[Captioner] 21:44:27
KNOW, THE CITY COUNCIL OR I HAVE 


[Captioner] 21:44:30
RECEIVED SEVERAL MESSAGES, TEN 


[Captioner] 21:44:34
TO 15 OF THEM, PLUS PUBLIC 


[Captioner] 21:44:37
COMMENT, REGARDING COUNCIL 


[Captioner] 21:44:38
CONDUCT AT THE MEETINGS.


[Captioner] 21:44:42
AND THAT IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE 


[Captioner] 21:44:44
FOLLOW RULES OF CONDUCT, RESPECT 


[Captioner] 21:44:46
AND ORDER, TOWARDS ONE ANOTHER, 


[Captioner] 21:44:49
SO THAT WE CAN HAVE EFFECTIVE 


[Captioner] 21:44:50
MEETINGS AND PRACTICE GOOD 


[Captioner] 21:44:51
GOVERNANCE.


[Captioner] 21:44:54
AND SO WE HAD A PRESENTATION 


[Captioner] 21:44:57
FROM OUR CITY ATTORNEY, WHO 


[Captioner] 21:44:59
RECENTLY GAVE US SOME BROWN ACT 


[Captioner] 21:44:59
TRAINING.


[Captioner] 21:45:02
AND THEN WE HAD OUR ANNUAL 


[Captioner] 21:45:06
RETREAT, AND WE WERE ALL VERY 


[Captioner] 21:45:09
INTERESTED IN ENSURING THAT WE 


[Captioner] 21:45:11
HAD EFFICIENT MEETINGS, I GUESS 


[Captioner] 21:45:13
WE ACTUALLY CAME TO A CONSENSUS 


[Captioner] 21:45:17
ABOUT BEING RESPECTFUL AND 


[Captioner] 21:45:18
TOLLING PROPER RULES OF ORDER 


[Captioner] 21:45:19
AND CONDUCT.


[Captioner] 21:45:23
AND -- FOLLOWING PROPER RULES OF 


[Captioner] 21:45:24
ORDER AND CONDUCT.


[Captioner] 21:45:26
AS A PART OF THAT THE HANDBOOK 


[Captioner] 21:45:28
WAS SILENT ON HOW WE WERE GOING 


[Captioner] 21:45:30
TO CONDUCT RULES OF ORDER.


[Captioner] 21:45:33
AND SO OUR CITY ATTORNEY 


[Captioner] 21:45:37
RECOMMENDED THAT WE MAKE A -- 


[Captioner] 21:45:43
MEMORIALIZE IT AND PUT IN THE 


[Captioner] 21:45:57
ROBERTSON'S ROBERSBERG'S --


[Captioner] 21:46:00
>> ROSENBERG'SNESS.


[Captioner] 21:46:01
>> Councilmember Campbell:   


[Captioner] 21:46:03
ROSENBERG'S RULES OF ORDER.


[Captioner] 21:46:08
THERE WAS A TYPO, IT SHOULD SAY 


[Captioner] 21:46:10
CONSERVATION, IT SHOULD SAY 


[Captioner] 21:46:11
CONVERSATION.


[Captioner] 21:46:13
WE CAN FIX THAT WHEN WE PUT 


[Captioner] 21:46:14
THESE IN THE MINUTES.


[Captioner] 21:46:20
AND SO I WOULD JUST LIKE TO HEAR 


[Captioner] 21:46:22
WHAT MY FELLOW COUNCILMEMBERS 


[Captioner] 21:46:22
THINK.


[Captioner] 21:46:24
I THINK WE DID MEMORIALIZE THIS 


[Captioner] 21:46:26
DURING OUR RETREAT AND THIS IS 


[Captioner] 21:46:29
JUST TO SOLIDIFY OUR THOUGHTS, 


[Captioner] 21:46:30
AS A TEAM.


[Captioner] 21:46:31
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 21:46:36
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU, 


[Captioner] 21:46:37
COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL FOR THIS 


[Captioner] 21:46:38
REFERRAL AND THE REMINDER TO 


[Captioner] 21:46:42
TAKE ACTION FROM OUR RETREAT.


[Captioner] 21:46:46
ARE THERE COMMENTS FROM THE 


[Captioner] 21:46:47
COUNCIL OR ARE THERE SPEAKER 


[Captioner] 21:46:49
CARDS ON THIS FIRST MAY I ASK?


[Captioner] 21:46:50
>> The Clerk:   THERE ARE NO 


[Captioner] 21:46:52
SPEAKER CARDS, NO HANDS ARE 


[Captioner] 21:46:55
RAISED IN ZOOM.


[Captioner] 21:46:59
FOR THE COUNCILMEMBERS, WE HAVE 


[Captioner] 21:47:01
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN AND 


[Captioner] 21:47:01
COUNCILMEMBER COX CURRENTLY IN 


[Captioner] 21:47:02
THE QUEUE.


[Captioner] 21:47:03
>> Mayor Mei:   OKAY, THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 21:47:07
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN.


[Captioner] 21:47:08
>> Councilmember Salwan:   I'M 


[Captioner] 21:47:09
READY TO SECOND COUNCILMEMBER 


[Captioner] 21:47:10
COX'S MOTION.


[Captioner] 21:47:13
OR CAMPBELL, SORRY.


[Captioner] 21:47:14
>> Mayor Mei:   OKAY.


[Captioner] 21:47:19
COUNCILMEMBER COX.


[Captioner] 21:47:19
>> Councilmember Cox:   I WAS 


[Captioner] 21:47:21
GOING TO SUGGEST THAT WE KIND OF 


[Captioner] 21:47:23
DIVE A LITTLE BIT MORE IN 


[Captioner] 21:47:24
KNOWING THE DIFFERENCE.


[Captioner] 21:47:26
BECAUSE I DID SOME PRELIMINARY 


[Captioner] 21:47:27
RESEARCH.


[Captioner] 21:47:30
AND ROSENBERG IS MORE ADOPTED 


[Captioner] 21:47:31
HERE IN CALIFORNIA.


[Captioner] 21:47:33
BUT WHEN YOU GO OUTSIDE OF 


[Captioner] 21:47:35
CALIFORNIA IT'S MORE ROBERT'S 


[Captioner] 21:47:35
RULES OF ORDER.


[Captioner] 21:47:39
AND I WANTED TO UNDERSTAND, 


[Captioner] 21:47:40
BEFORE MOVING FORWARD, I 


[Captioner] 21:47:42
APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE DOING TO 


[Captioner] 21:47:45
BRING FORTH AN ACTION TO MAKE 


[Captioner] 21:47:47
SURE OUR MEETINGS ARE EFFICIENT, 


[Captioner] 21:47:48
AND IN ORDER.


[Captioner] 21:47:51
I JUST WANTED TO SEE WHAT IS THE 


[Captioner] 21:47:52
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO OF 


[Captioner] 21:47:53
THEM.


[Captioner] 21:47:55
BUT ALSO, LIKE, WHERE WOULD BE 


[Captioner] 21:47:58
MARKING UP THE HANDBOOK TO ADOPT 


[Captioner] 21:47:59
IT?


[Captioner] 21:48:01
AND JUST KIND OF MAKE SURE I 


[Captioner] 21:48:02
UNDERSTAND THAT PIECE OF IT.


[Captioner] 21:48:17
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado:   


[Captioner] 21:48:19
ROANSBERG'S RULES OF ORDER HAS 


[Captioner] 21:48:22
THE PUBLIC AGENCIES, ROBERT'S 


[Captioner] 21:48:26
RULES OF ORDER CAN BE FOCUSED 


[Captioner] 21:48:28
AND LARGER BODIES HAVE LARGER 


[Captioner] 21:48:29
SETS OF RULES.


[Captioner] 21:48:31
THAT'S WHY THE HAND BERG IS A 


[Captioner] 21:48:34
LOT LONGER THAN EITHER 


[Captioner] 21:48:37
ROSENBERG'S RULES OF ORDER OR 


[Captioner] 21:48:38
OUR OWN HANDBOOK.


[Captioner] 21:48:40
THE INTENT OF THAT PARTICULAR 


[Captioner] 21:48:43
DOCUMENT IS TO MAKE IT EASY FOR 


[Captioner] 21:48:46
CITY COUNCILS TO PERFORM 


[Captioner] 21:48:48
PARLIAMENTARY PROCEDURE.


[Captioner] 21:48:50
AND NOT HAVE TO REFER BACK TO 


[Captioner] 21:48:54
ROBERT'S RULES OF ORDER, IT IS A 


[Captioner] 21:48:55
CALIFORNIA BASED DOCUMENT, IT IS 


[Captioner] 21:48:58
A CALIFORNIA JUDGE THAT DRAFTED 


[Captioner] 21:49:01
ROSENBERG'S RULES, SPECIFICALLY 


[Captioner] 21:49:03
WITH THE INTENT OF HELPING LOCAL 


[Captioner] 21:49:04
GOVERNMENT IN THEIR DECISION 


[Captioner] 21:49:06
MAKING TO MAKE PROCESSES SIMPLE.


[Captioner] 21:49:08
SO I CAN'T SPEAK FOR HOW WIDELY 


[Captioner] 21:49:10
ADOPTED IT IS OUTSIDE OF THE 


[Captioner] 21:49:12
STATE BUT I KNOW THAT AT LEAST 


[Captioner] 21:49:17
40 LOCAL CITIES, LOCAL PUBLIC 


[Captioner] 21:49:19
AGENCIES HAVE ADOPTED IT.


[Captioner] 21:49:21
THIS BODY IS AHEAD OF THE 


[Captioner] 21:49:23
MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIA PUBLIC 


[Captioner] 21:49:26
AGENCIES BECAUSE YOUR HANDBOOK 


[Captioner] 21:49:29
DOES SPIFER PROCEDURAL RULES OF 


[Captioner] 21:49:33
ORDER, AND IF THIS MATTER MOVES 


[Captioner] 21:49:35
FORWARD THIS EVENING, STAFF WILL 


[Captioner] 21:49:40
HAVE TO SYNTHESIZE ROSENBERG'S 


[Captioner] 21:49:40
RULES OF ORDER.


[Captioner] 21:49:43
IN ANY CASE THE GOAL OF 


[Captioner] 21:49:46
ROSENBERG'S REUP RULE IS TO 


[Captioner] 21:49:47
SIMPLIFY PARLIAMENTARY 


[Captioner] 21:49:48
PROCEDURE.


[Captioner] 21:49:48
>> Councilmember Cox:   OKAY, 


[Captioner] 21:49:50
BECAUSE THE MOTION, THE 


[Captioner] 21:49:51
REFERRAL, UNLESS WE KIND OF 


[Captioner] 21:49:53
TWEAK IT A LITTLE BIT IS THAT I 


[Captioner] 21:49:55
WOULD LIKE TO THEN HAVE IT -- IF 


[Captioner] 21:49:57
WE ADOPT IT BUT THEN HAVE IT 


[Captioner] 21:50:00
MARKED UP, SO IT THEN IS PART OF 


[Captioner] 21:50:06
THE ROSENBERG'S RULES OF ORDER.


[Captioner] 21:50:08
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado:   YES.


[Captioner] 21:50:09
>> Councilmember Cox:   HOW 


[Captioner] 21:50:10
WOULD THAT BE CHANGED OLOT OR 


[Captioner] 21:50:13
WOULD THAT BE DRASTIC FOR OUR 


[Captioner] 21:50:13
HANDBOOK?


[Captioner] 21:50:14
KIND OF UNDERSTANDING THE 


[Captioner] 21:50:16
ASSESSMENT OF UPDATING THE 


[Captioner] 21:50:17
HANDBOOK TO REFLECT THAT.


[Captioner] 21:50:19
BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE I'M KIND OF 


[Captioner] 21:50:21
SEEING WHAT IS -- ARE WE GAINING 


[Captioner] 21:50:23
MORE OR ARE WE GAINING LESS OR 


[Captioner] 21:50:24
JUST KIND OF UNDERSTANDING THE 


[Captioner] 21:50:29
IMPACT OF THAT?


[Captioner] 21:50:29
>> Councilmember Campbell:   


[Captioner] 21:50:30
WELT I THINK THAT THE CITY 


[Captioner] 21:50:31
ATTORNEY WILL BE BRINGING IT 


[Captioner] 21:50:33
BACK TO US BECAUSE THE REFERRAL 


[Captioner] 21:50:35
IS JUST ASKING THEM TO ACTUALLY 


[Captioner] 21:50:37
ADOPT IT AS A PART OF THE 


[Captioner] 21:50:38
HANDBOOK.


[Captioner] 21:50:40
AND SO THEY PROBABLY NEED SOME 


[Captioner] 21:50:42
TIME TO FIGURE THAT OUT.


[Captioner] 21:50:43
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado:   LET 


[Captioner] 21:50:46
ME OFFER THIS PROCEDURAL REMARK.


[Captioner] 21:50:47
.


[Captioner] 21:50:48
>> Councilmember Cox:   YES.


[Captioner] 21:50:49
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado:   THIS 


[Captioner] 21:50:51
EVENING WE WOULD NOT BE ADOPTING 


[Captioner] 21:50:53
ROSENBERG'S RULES OF ORDER.


[Captioner] 21:50:55
YOU RAISE AN IMPORTANT QUESTION 


[Captioner] 21:50:57
AND I THINK IT'S THE INTENT OF 


[Captioner] 21:50:58
COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL TO DIRECT 


[Captioner] 21:50:59
STAFF TO COME BACK SO YOU CAN 


[Captioner] 21:51:02
SEE THE PROPOSED CHANGES ONCE WE 


[Captioner] 21:51:03
SYNTHESIZE THE TWO DOCUMENTS.


[Captioner] 21:51:05
SO THIS EVENING ESSENTIALLY, 


[Captioner] 21:51:07
WHERE IF THE COUNCIL MOVES THE 


[Captioner] 21:51:09
REFERRAL FORWARD WE'D COME BACK, 


[Captioner] 21:51:11
STAFF WOULD COME BACK AT A 


[Captioner] 21:51:13
FUTURE DATE WITH A RED-LINED 


[Captioner] 21:51:15
HANDBOOK FOR COUNCIL 


[Captioner] 21:51:16
CONSIDERATION.


[Captioner] 21:51:18
IN FACT, THE COUNCIL WILL HAVE 


[Captioner] 21:51:21
TO ADOPT THE RESOLUTION TO ADOPT 


[Captioner] 21:51:22
THE CHANGES.


[Captioner] 21:51:23
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT'S REQUIRED 


[Captioner] 21:51:27
UNDER THE COUNCIL'S OWN 


[Captioner] 21:51:27
PROCEDURE.


[Captioner] 21:51:31
SO WE'RE COMING BACK, FOR FUTURE 


[Captioner] 21:51:33
ACTIONS.


[Captioner] 21:51:34
>> Councilmember Cox:   BUT THE 


[Captioner] 21:51:35
REFERRAL DOESN'T SAY THAT, IT 


[Captioner] 21:51:36
SAYS UPDATE.


[Captioner] 21:51:38
IT DOESN'T SAY IT WOULD COME 


[Captioner] 21:51:40
BACK TO REVIEW THE RED LINES.


[Captioner] 21:51:41
THAT'S THE PART THAT MAYBE WE 


[Captioner] 21:51:44
COULD DO -- IF YOU WANTED TO 


[Captioner] 21:51:46
COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL, TO ADD 


[Captioner] 21:51:48
ON, THAT IT WOULD BE -- IT'S NOT 


[Captioner] 21:51:49
JUST -- IT'S ADOPTING THE RULES 


[Captioner] 21:51:52
OF ORDER BUT IT'S ALSO COMING 


[Captioner] 21:51:54
BACK WITH A MARKED-UP HANDBOOK.


[Captioner] 21:51:55
>> Councilmember Campbell:   THE 


[Captioner] 21:51:56
RECOMMENDATION DOES SAY DIRECT 


[Captioner] 21:51:58
STAFF TO UPDATE THE FREMONT CITY 


[Captioner] 21:52:01
COUNCIL'S HANDBOOK TO 


[Captioner] 21:52:02
INCORPORATE ROSENBERG'S RULE OF 


[Captioner] 21:52:05
ORDER AS STANDARD RULES OF 


[Captioner] 21:52:06
ORDER.


[Captioner] 21:52:08
NOW IT'S STANDARD PROCEDURE THAT 


[Captioner] 21:52:11
IF IF THEY DO THIS, IF -- THAT 


[Captioner] 21:52:14
IT HAS TO COME BACK FOR US, FOR 


[Captioner] 21:52:16
FINAL APPROVAL.


[Captioner] 21:52:16
>> Councilmember Cox:   IN ORDER 


[Captioner] 21:52:18
TO APPROVE IT TO ADOPT IT.


[Captioner] 21:52:19
WHAT ARE WE VOTING ON TONIGHT 


[Captioner] 21:52:20
THEN?


[Captioner] 21:52:23
JUST TO UPDATE IT TO THE 


[Captioner] 21:52:25
ROSENBERG'S RULES OF ORDER?


[Captioner] 21:52:26
I JUST WANT TO KNOW WHAT THE 


[Captioner] 21:52:28
IMPACT OF THE TWO BECAUSE I JUST -- I 

[Captioner] 21:52:29
DON'T HAVE ENOUGH 


[Captioner] 21:52:32
INFORMATION.


[Captioner] 21:52:33
>> SO YOU'RE NOT ADOPTING 


[Captioner] 21:52:34
ANYTHING TONIGHT.


[Captioner] 21:52:35
IF YOU MOVE THIS REFERRAL 


[Captioner] 21:52:42
FORWARD, AS RAFAEL SAID, WE 


[Captioner] 21:52:43
OCOME BACK WITH A MARKED UP 


[Captioner] 21:52:44
VERSION OF THE HANDBOOK 


[Captioner] 21:52:46
DEMONSTRATING WHAT THE CHANGES 


[Captioner] 21:52:46
ARE .


[Captioner] 21:52:48
IF YOU ALL ARE IN AGREEMENT WITH 


[Captioner] 21:52:50
THOSE CHANGES AT THAT TIME, THEN 


[Captioner] 21:52:53
YOU WOULD, YOU KNOW, APPROVE THE 


[Captioner] 21:52:56
CHANGES BY RESOLUTION.


[Captioner] 21:52:59
APPROVE THE CHANGES MEANING 


[Captioner] 21:53:00
INCORPORATE ROSENBERG'S RULES OF 


[Captioner] 21:53:03
ORDER IN THE HANDBOOK AS OPPOSED 


[Captioner] 21:53:05
TO THE PARLIAMENTARY PROCEDURES 


[Captioner] 21:53:06
THAT ARE CURRENTLY LISTED.


[Captioner] 21:53:08
SO YOU WILL HAVE A SECOND BITE 


[Captioner] 21:53:09
AT THE APPLE.


[Captioner] 21:53:10
>> Councilmember Cox:   OKAY, I 


[Captioner] 21:53:12
JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE I 


[Captioner] 21:53:13
UNDERSTOOD THE PROCESS.


[Captioner] 21:53:15
AND THEN UNDERSTANDING THAT 


[Captioner] 21:53:18
WHERE WE WOULD GIVE OR TAKE, IS 


[Captioner] 21:53:19
THERE -- WHEN YOU DO YOUR 


[Captioner] 21:53:21
ANALYSIS OR UPDATE IT, WITH THE 


[Captioner] 21:53:25
ROSENBERG IS THERE SOME THINGS 


[Captioner] 21:53:26
THAT WE'RE TAKING OFF THE TABLE 


[Captioner] 21:53:28
THAT WE WOULD NORMALLY HAVE THE 


[Captioner] 21:53:30
RIGHT IF IT'S UNDER 


[Captioner] 21:53:31
PARLIAMENTARY PROCEDURE?


[Captioner] 21:53:33
WOULD WE LOSE ANYTHING, THAT'S 


[Captioner] 21:53:35
WHAT I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND, 


[Captioner] 21:53:37
IN OUR MEETING EFFICIENCY AND 


[Captioner] 21:53:39
ORDER OF OPERATION DURING OUR 


[Captioner] 21:53:42
MEETINGS?


[Captioner] 21:53:43
>> Karena Shackelford:   I THINK 


[Captioner] 21:53:45
THE INTENT IS THAT YOU WOULD BE 


[Captioner] 21:53:48
GAINING SOMETHING BY DOING THIS.


[Captioner] 21:53:50
AND I THINK SOME OF IT WAS 


[Captioner] 21:53:51
COVERED IN THE TRAINING THAT 


[Captioner] 21:53:53
RAFAEL DID A COUPLE OF WEEKS 


[Captioner] 21:53:57
AGO, WHERE HE INTRODUCED THE 


[Captioner] 21:54:00
TOPIC UF ROSENBERG'S RULES OF 


[Captioner] 21:54:03
ORDER WITH THE INTENT OF USING 


[Captioner] 21:54:05
THOSE TO BE TO GAIN EFFICIENCY 


[Captioner] 21:54:07
IN THE MEETINGS AND MOVE THINGS 


[Captioner] 21:54:10
ALONG MORE EFFECTIVELY.


[Captioner] 21:54:10
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado:   JUST 


[Captioner] 21:54:13
TO CLARIFY THE ADMINISTRATIVE 


[Captioner] 21:54:13
RECORD.


[Captioner] 21:54:15
AT THE BROWN ACT TRAINING I DID 


[Captioner] 21:54:17
NOT MAKE A RECOMMENDATION TO 


[Captioner] 21:54:19
ADOPT ROSENBERG'S RULES BECAUSE 


[Captioner] 21:54:21
MOSTLY WHAT I WANTED TO DO WAS 


[Captioner] 21:54:24
INTRODUCE THE ORDER OF HOW 


[Captioner] 21:54:25
AGENDA ITEMS ARE DISCUSSED.


[Captioner] 21:54:27
THERE WAS A SPECIFIC PROCEDURAL 


[Captioner] 21:54:28
QUESTION ABOUT WHEN A PARTY CAN 


[Captioner] 21:54:29
MOVE.


[Captioner] 21:54:31
AND I THOUGHT THE MOST EFFICIENT 


[Captioner] 21:54:34
WAY OF DESCRIBING IT WAS THE 


[Captioner] 21:54:38
PRACTICE IDENTIFIED IN 


[Captioner] 21:54:40
ROSENBERG'S RULES.


[Captioner] 21:54:43
I USED THAT AS AN EXEMPLARY 


[Captioner] 21:54:43
PARTICULAR.


[Captioner] 21:54:49
IT WASN'T THAT AND ROSENBERG'S 


[Captioner] 21:54:52
IS RULES IN MY VIEW SUCCINCTLY 


[Captioner] 21:54:54
DESCRIBES HOW TO PROCEED ON EACH 


[Captioner] 21:54:56
AGENDA ITEM SO IF THE COUNCIL 


[Captioner] 21:54:59
DECIDES TO MOVE FORWARD AS 


[Captioner] 21:55:02
 


[Captioner] 21:55:05
KARENA INDICATED, WE WOULD SHOW 


[Captioner] 21:55:08
YOU RED LINES FOR YOU TO 


[Captioner] 21:55:09
CONSIDER AND REVIEW BEFORE YOU 


[Captioner] 21:55:10
TOOK ACTION.


[Captioner] 21:55:11
>> Councilmember Cox:   OKAY.


[Captioner] 21:55:11
>> Councilmember Campbell:   I 


[Captioner] 21:55:14
ALSO THINK AT OUR RETREAT WE 


[Captioner] 21:55:15
GAINED CONSENSUS AROUND HOW WE 


[Captioner] 21:55:17
WOULD MAKE MOTIONS AND WHEN WE 


[Captioner] 21:55:18
WOULD MAKE MOTIONS.


[Captioner] 21:55:20
BECAUSE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT 


[Captioner] 21:55:23
WE WANTED TO ACCOMPLISH WAS THAT 


[Captioner] 21:55:27
THE CHAIR, THE MAYOR, HAD RAN 


[Captioner] 21:55:30
THE MEETING, AND WAS ABLE TO 


[Captioner] 21:55:33
MOVE THE AGENDA ALONG, AS THE 


[Captioner] 21:55:34
CHAIR.


[Captioner] 21:55:36
BECAUSE WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT WE 


[Captioner] 21:55:38
WERE SPENDING A LOT OF TIME 


[Captioner] 21:55:41
DISCUSSING, AND NO MOTION WAS 


[Captioner] 21:55:41
BEING MADE.


[Captioner] 21:55:43
AND THEN WE WOULD COME BACK TO 


[Captioner] 21:55:44
THE SAME THING AND WE WIND UP 


[Captioner] 21:55:46
SAYING THE SAME THING OVER AND 


[Captioner] 21:55:48
OVER IN A DIFFERENT WAY.


[Captioner] 21:55:50
BUT SOMETIMES THE SAME THING 


[Captioner] 21:55:51
OVER AND OVER.


[Captioner] 21:55:53
AND BY ALLOWING THE COUNCIL TO 


[Captioner] 21:55:56
BE ABLE TO MAKE A MOTION AND 


[Captioner] 21:55:57
SOMEBODY SECOND IT DOESN'T SHUT 


[Captioner] 21:55:59
YOU DOWN FROM BEING ABLE TO 


[Captioner] 21:56:01
CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION BUT IT 


[Captioner] 21:56:07
ALLOWS THE CHAIR TO THEN -- CALL 


[Captioner] 21:56:10
THE QUESTION SO THAT WE CAN MOVE 


[Captioner] 21:56:12
ON, TAKE THE VOTE AND THEN WE 


[Captioner] 21:56:14
CAN MOVE ON TO THE NEXT AGENDA 


[Captioner] 21:56:16
ITEM AND WE WOULDN'T BE GOING 


[Captioner] 21:56:18
ROUND AND ROUND AND ROUND AND 


[Captioner] 21:56:18
ROUND.


[Captioner] 21:56:20
AND I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT 


[Captioner] 21:56:23
PART OF BEING EFFICIENT IN OUR 


[Captioner] 21:56:26
MEETINGS, IS THAT WE ALLOW THE 


[Captioner] 21:56:28
CHAIR TO RUN THE MEETINGS AND 


[Captioner] 21:56:32
ALLOW -- BE ABLE TO DIRECT WHEN 


[Captioner] 21:56:33
A MOTION CAN BE MADE OR WHEN 


[Captioner] 21:56:35
IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE MADE.


[Captioner] 21:56:39
AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT THIS --


[Captioner] 21:56:40
>> Councilmember Cox:   BUT HOW 


[Captioner] 21:56:41
IS THAT DIFFERENT?


[Captioner] 21:56:42
THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO 


[Captioner] 21:56:43
UNDERSTAND, HOW IS THAT 


[Captioner] 21:56:44
DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WE HAVE 


[Captioner] 21:56:45
ALREADY?


[Captioner] 21:56:46
THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO 


[Captioner] 21:56:48
UNDERSTAND THE DELTA OF WHAT WE 


[Captioner] 21:56:51
HAVE IN OUR HANDBOOK NOW VERSUS 


[Captioner] 21:56:54
THE ROSENBERG --


[Captioner] 21:56:54
>> Councilmember Campbell:   


[Captioner] 21:56:56
THEN THAT'S THE --


[Captioner] 21:56:56
>> Councilmember Cox:   THAT'S 


[Captioner] 21:56:58
 


[Captioner] 21:57:00
THE PART THAT I DON'T HAVE 


[Captioner] 21:57:01
ENOUGH INFORMATION ON.


[Captioner] 21:57:03
I PULLED OUT HERE'S THE CHEAT 


[Captioner] 21:57:06
SHEET FOR ROBERT'S RULE AND 


[Captioner] 21:57:09
CHEAT SHEET FOR ROSENBERG.


[Captioner] 21:57:12
SOME OF THIS IS IDENTICAL.


[Captioner] 21:57:14
I'M JUST ASKING SO I CAN 


[Captioner] 21:57:15
UNDERSTAND.


[Captioner] 21:57:15
>> Councilmember Campbell:   BUT 


[Captioner] 21:57:17
THAT'S NOT WHAT THE MOTION -- 


[Captioner] 21:57:19
THAT'S NOT WHAT MY MOTION IS 


[Captioner] 21:57:20
THAT'S ON THE FLOOR RIGHT NOW, 


[Captioner] 21:57:24
IT IS THOUGHT THAT, THAT WE 


[Captioner] 21:57:29
ADOPT ROBERTS -- WE ASK THEM TO 


[Captioner] 21:57:30
INCORPORATE ROBERT'S RULES OF 


[Captioner] 21:57:32
ORDER IN THE HANDBOOK.


[Captioner] 21:57:35
MY MOTION IS TO ASK THEM TO GO 


[Captioner] 21:57:37
BACK, TAKE A LOOK AT IT, ADD IT 


[Captioner] 21:57:38
TO THE HANDBOOK AND BRING IT 


[Captioner] 21:57:41
BACK TO US FOR CONSIDERATION.


[Captioner] 21:57:42
>> Councilmember Cox:   OKAY, 


[Captioner] 21:57:43
WELL I THINK THE CONSIDERATION 


[Captioner] 21:57:44
PART IS MISSING.


[Captioner] 21:57:47
BECAUSE IT SAYS DIRECT STAFF TO 


[Captioner] 21:57:48
UPDATE THE HANDBOOK TO 


[Captioner] 21:57:49
INCORPORATE IT.


[Captioner] 21:57:50
BUT IT DOESN'T SAY TO BRING IT 


[Captioner] 21:57:53
BACK FOR US TO REVIEW IT.


[Captioner] 21:57:55
I THINK THAT'S THE PART THAT I 


[Captioner] 21:57:56
JUST DON'T SEE THE FULL CIRCLE 


[Captioner] 21:57:58
HERE.


[Captioner] 21:57:58
>> Councilmember Campbell:   


[Captioner] 21:57:59
OKAY.


[Captioner] 21:58:01
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado:   TWO 


[Captioner] 21:58:02
PROCEDURAL OBSERVATIONS.


[Captioner] 21:58:05
NUMBER 1 THE MOVEMENT HAS 


[Captioner] 21:58:07
CLARIFIED THE INTENT OF HER 


[Captioner] 21:58:09
REFERRAL, SO I THINK WE CAN RELY 


[Captioner] 21:58:09
ON THAT.


[Captioner] 21:58:12
AND NUMBER 2, EVEN IF THERE WAS 


[Captioner] 21:58:13
CONFUSION STAFF WOULD NOT BE 


[Captioner] 21:58:15
ABLE TO ADOPT THE CHANGES THIS 


[Captioner] 21:58:15
EVENING.


[Captioner] 21:58:17
IT IS ONLY A REFERRAL.


[Captioner] 21:58:19
THE CHANGES MUST BE ADOPTED BY 


[Captioner] 21:58:20
RESOLUTION, SO WE WOULD HAVE TO 


[Captioner] 21:58:22
COME BACK IN ANY CIRCUMSTANCE.


[Captioner] 21:58:23
>> Councilmember Cox:   OKAY SO 


[Captioner] 21:58:25
PART 1 WE JUST UPDATE IT THEN 


[Captioner] 21:58:28
YOU SHOW US THE RED LINES.


[Captioner] 21:58:31
OKAY JUST AS LONG AS THERE'S 


[Captioner] 21:58:32
UNDERSTANDING.


[Captioner] 21:58:32
OKAY.


[Captioner] 21:58:36
>> Mayor Mei:   MOVED AND 


[Captioner] 21:58:38
SECONDED TO MOVE THE REFERRAL TO 


[Captioner] 21:58:39
ASK FOR THE INCLUSION OF THE 


[Captioner] 21:58:42
UPDATE TO REFLECT --


[Captioner] 21:58:44
>> Councilmember Kassan:   I DID 


[Captioner] 21:58:46
HAVE A QUESTION.


[Captioner] 21:58:46
>> The Clerk:   COUNCILMEMBER 


[Captioner] 21:58:48
KASSAN HAS A QUESTION.


[Captioner] 21:58:49
>> Councilmember Kassan:   I'M 


[Captioner] 21:58:50
JUST CONFUSED.


[Captioner] 21:58:52
BECAUSE MY MEMORY IS THAT WHEN 


[Captioner] 21:58:54

[Captioner] 22:00:41
LATEST MEETINGS ON TWO 


[Captioner] 22:00:43
COMMISSIONS THAT I WAS ASSIGNED 


[Captioner] 22:00:45
TO REPRESENT FREMONT.


[Captioner] 22:00:48
ONE IS HAKA, THE HOUSING 


[Captioner] 22:00:53
AUTHORITY OF COUNTY OF ALAMEDA.


[Captioner] 22:00:58
I'M GLAD TO REPORT THAT HACA, 


[Captioner] 22:01:01
KEPT RECEIVING SPECIAL VOUCHERS 


[Captioner] 22:01:05
FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, FOR 


[Captioner] 22:01:08
PROJECT SPECIFIC USAGE.


[Captioner] 22:01:19
FOR EXAMPLE, THE HOME KEY 


[Captioner] 22:01:21
PROJECTS AROUND THE CITY.


[Captioner] 22:01:24
I AM WORKING WITH HACA TO MAKE 


[Captioner] 22:01:26
SURE THAT FREMONT GET OUR FAIR 


[Captioner] 22:01:28
SHARE OF HOMEKEY PROJECTS.


[Captioner] 22:01:29
THAT IS NUMBER 1.


[Captioner] 22:01:36
NUMBER 2, I JUST ATTENDED STAFF 


[Captioner] 22:01:39
WASTE COMMISSION MEETING ON 


[Captioner] 22:01:41
BEHALF OF FREMONT.


[Captioner] 22:01:42
IN FRONT OF ME I NOTICED THERE 


[Captioner] 22:01:46
WAS A 100% COMPOSTABLE CUP THAT 


[Captioner] 22:01:50
REMINDS ME THAT FIRST, THE STOP 


[Captioner] 22:01:52
WASTE COMMISSION JUST CONCLUDED 


[Captioner] 22:01:55

[Captioner] 22:02:05
WASTE.


[Captioner] 22:02:12
AND SECONDLY, WE'RE RUNNING YEAR 


[Captioner] 22:02:21
ROUND THE COMPOSTING PROGRAM SO 


[Captioner] 22:02:24
BASICALLY EVEN FOR FREMONT WE 


[Captioner] 22:02:25
HAVE LEAVE.


[Captioner] 22:02:31
SO THAT STOP WASTE COLLABORATE 


[Captioner] 22:02:35
WITH, TO GENERATE SUCH 


[Captioner] 22:02:37
COMPOSTABLE MATERIALS TO BENEFIT 


[Captioner] 22:02:39

[Captioner] 22:02:42
 


[Captioner] 22:02:44
REMINDER TO THE PUBLIC, MARCH 


[Captioner] 22:02:49
31st, I BELIEVE, THE REPUBLIC

[Captioner] 22:03:02
PRODUCTS, TO THE SOIL, TO THE 


[Captioner] 22:03:07
COMMUNITY, AND THIS IS ONCE 


[Captioner] 22:03:09
AGAIN AN ONGOING EFFORT FOR US 


[Captioner] 22:03:12
TO NOT ONLY TO REDUCE WASTE BUT 


[Captioner] 22:03:14
BASICALLY, PUT THE WASTE INTO 


[Captioner] 22:03:15
SOMETHING USEFUL FOR THE 


[Captioner] 22:03:16
COMMUNITY.


[Captioner] 22:03:17
SO THAT'S MY REPORT.


[Captioner] 22:03:24

COX ALSO HAS REQUESTED TO SPEAK.


[Captioner] 22:03:30
>> Councilmember Cox:   THANK 


[Captioner] 22:03:31
YOU.


[Captioner] 22:03:33
JUST WANTED TO REPORT-OUT THAT 


[Captioner] 22:03:34
LAST WEDNESDAY ON MARCH THE 


[Captioner] 22:03:36
8th I ATTENDED A SPECIAL 


[Captioner] 22:03:39
MEETING THAT WAS BY THE EAST BAY 


[Captioner] 22:03:42
COMMUNITY ENERGY BOARD OF 


[Captioner] 22:03:45
DIRECTORS, AND THEY -- THE EAST 


[Captioner] 22:03:49
BAY ENERGY DID A SPECIAL SEMINAR 


[Captioner] 22:03:52
ON THE POWER PROCUREMENT.


[Captioner] 22:03:54
SO HOW DOES EAST BAY COMMUNITY 


[Captioner] 22:03:58
ENERGY GO ABOUT BUYING THE 


[Captioner] 22:03:58
POWER?


[Captioner] 22:04:01
AND GOING THROUGH ANALYZING, 


[Captioner] 22:04:02
IDENTIFYING THE DIFFERENT 


[Captioner] 22:04:04
PRODUCTS THAT ARE OUT THERE, 


[Captioner] 22:04:06
THAT ARE TIED IN WITH REVIEWING 


[Captioner] 22:04:08
REALLY A CONTRACT PORTFOLIO OF 


[Captioner] 22:04:10
HOW THEY GOT TO BUY THE PRODUCTS 


[Captioner] 22:04:13
THAT THEY ARE INVOLVED IN.


[Captioner] 22:04:15
AND IT STARTED, WHETHER IT WAS 


[Captioner] 22:04:18
SOLAR, WHETHER IT WAS RENEWABLE 


[Captioner] 22:04:19
ENERGY, THE CREDITS THAT YOU 


[Captioner] 22:04:21
GET, THE FIVE DIFFERENT OR SIX 


[Captioner] 22:04:22
DIFFERENT REGULATIONS YOU HAVE 


[Captioner] 22:04:24
TO MEET, THERE'S A LOT OF 


[Captioner] 22:04:26
DIFFERENT FINANCE AND HEDGING 


[Captioner] 22:04:28
FUNDS TO REDUCE THE RISK, AND 


[Captioner] 22:04:30
THEN, ALL OF THIS IS LONG TERM.


[Captioner] 22:04:32
IT'S NOT THAT YOU CAN INVEST IN 


[Captioner] 22:04:32
FIVE YEARS.


[Captioner] 22:04:34
YOU HAVE TO INVEST UP TO AT 


[Captioner] 22:04:36
LEAST 20, 25 YEARS TO SEE THE 


[Captioner] 22:04:39
RETURN OF INVESTMENT ON THESE 


[Captioner] 22:04:41
ENERGY PROJECTS THAT ARE BEING 


[Captioner] 22:04:44
BROUGHT ON ACROSS.


[Captioner] 22:04:47
IT'S OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA AS 


[Captioner] 22:04:47
WELL AS INSIDE CALIFORNIA.


[Captioner] 22:04:51
SO IT WAS VERY DETAILED, AND 


[Captioner] 22:04:53
VERY IMPRESSIVE, OF THE TYPE OF 


[Captioner] 22:04:54
INVESTMENTS AND THE THINGS THAT 


[Captioner] 22:04:56
THEY HAVE TO THINK ABOUT IN 


[Captioner] 22:04:58
MAKING THESE INVESTMENTS TO KEEP 


[Captioner] 22:05:00
THE ENERGY COSTS DOWN AND ALSO 


[Captioner] 22:05:04
TO BE ABLE TO SUPPLY THE DEMAND, 


[Captioner] 22:05:07
THE CAPACITY, BUT ALSO HOW 


[Captioner] 22:05:09
RELIABLE THE ENERGY IS NEEDED 


[Captioner] 22:05:11
WHEN WE NEED TO TURN ON OUR 


[Captioner] 22:05:14
LIGHTS OR TURN ON, YOU KNOW, 


[Captioner] 22:05:16
COOKING IN THE KITCHEN.


[Captioner] 22:05:17
SO THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS THAT 


[Captioner] 22:05:19
GO INTO EVALUATING AND MAKING 


[Captioner] 22:05:21
THOSE TYPE OF DECISIONS.


[Captioner] 22:05:24
SO I REALLY THANK THE EAST BAY 


[Captioner] 22:05:28
COMMUNITY ENERGY TEAM, TO SHARE 


[Captioner] 22:05:31
THAT INFORMATION, AND TO HELP US 


[Captioner] 22:05:33
IN KEEPING REALLY -- IT'S A 


[Captioner] 22:05:35
CLEAN ENERGY STRATEGY OF HOW 


[Captioner] 22:05:37
WE'RE GOING TO GET THERE.


[Captioner] 22:05:38
