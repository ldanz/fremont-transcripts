NEXT ON OUR AGENDA ITEM THIS EVENING WILL BE A CEREMONIAL ITEM, A 
19:08:09 PROCLAMATION FOR PRIDE MONTH.
I WANTED TO THANK -- I THINK IT WILL BE ACCEPTED THIS EVENING BY JOHN 
19:08:22 SCHINKEL.
 WHEREAS, THE CITY OF FREMONT IS STRENGTHENED BY THE RICH DIVERSITY OF 
19:08:26 ETHNIC CULTURAL, RACIAL, GENDER, AND SEXUAL IDENTITIES OF ITS RESIDENTS; ALL OF WHICH CONTRIBUTE TO THE 
19:08:32 CHARACTER OF OUR CITY; AND WHEREAS, THE CITY OF FREMONT RECENTLY PROCLAIMED MAY 17 AS INTERNATIONAL DAY AGAINST 
19:08:37 HOMOPHOBIA, TRANSPHOBIA, AND BIPHOBIA; WHICH STATES THE HUMAN RIGHTS OF LGBTQ+ PERSONS ARE THE SAME AS HUMAN 
19:08:44 RIGHTS TO WHICH ALL PERSONS ARE ENTITLED; AND WHEREAS, THE CITY OF FREMONT HAS A LONG STANDING TRADITION 
19:08:53 OF UPHOLDING THE DIGNITY OF THE INDIVIDUAL, SUPPORTING LEGAL EQUALITY AND FAIR TREATMENT FOR ALL CITIZENS 
19:09:00 AND ENSURING THAT ACTS OF DISCRIMINATION AND HATRED WILL NOT BE TOLERATED, HAVING EARNED 90 OUT OF A 
19:09:13 POSSIBLE 100 POINTS ON THE HUMAN RIGHTS CAMPAIGN'S MUNICIPAL EQUALITY INDEX; AND WHEREAS, FOR MANY YEARS, THE HUMAN 
19:09:18 RELATIONS COMMISSION HAS ORGANIZED AN OFFICIAL CITY OF FREMONT ENTRY AND PARTICIPATED IN THE SAN FRANCISCO 
19:09:27 PRIDE PARADE; AND WHEREAS, AS A COMPASSIONATE SANCTUARY CITY, THE CITY OF FREMONT RECOGNIZES THAT RESIDENTS 
19:09:32 HAVE A RIGHT TO IDENTIFY AS GENDER NON-CONFORMING, INCLUDING NON- BINARY AND GENDER FLUID, HAVE ALL-GENDER 
19:09:39 INCLUSIONS IN PUBLIC FACILITIES, AND CONTINUALLY RECEIVE THE SUPPORT AND RECOGNITION THAT GENDER NON-BINARY 
19:09:49 PEOPLE DESERVE. NOW, THEREFORE, THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF FREMONT HEREBY PROCLAIMS JUNE 2022 AS PRIDE 
19:09:55 MONTH IN THE CITY OF FREMONT AND ENCOURAGES EVERYONE IN OUR COMMUNITY TO CELEBRATE THE SPIRIT AND DEDICATION 
19:10:03 OF THIS VIBRANT COMMUNITY BY RAISING THE PRIDE FLAG, COMMITTING TO
JOIN THE SAN FRANCISCO PRIDE EVENTS IN 
19:10:09 WHATEVER CAPACITY AVAILABLE THROUGHOUT THE MONTH OF JUNE AND PARTICIPATE IN OTHER ACTIVITIES WHICH CELEBRATE THE 
19:10:15 HUMAN SPIRIT.
AND AGAIN, I THINK ACCEPTING THIS EVENING WILL BE JOHN SCHINKEL.

19:10:21 >> GOOD EVENING, MAYOR MEI.
GOOD EVENING, COUNCILMEMBERS.
WHILE I KNOW MANY OF YOU INDIVIDUALLY, 
19:10:26 I'D LIKE TO REINTRODUCE MYSELF.
MY NAME IS JOHN SCHINKEL AND I'M A LIFELONG RESIDENT OF THE CITY OF 
19:10:30 FREMONT AND MY FAMILY HAS RESIDED HERE FOR 50 YEARS.
I WAS SELECTED BY THE HUMAN RELATIONS 
19:10:36 COMMISSION'S LGBTQ+ COMMITTEE TO BE THE RECIPIENT OF THIS PRIDE MONTH PROCLAMATION AND I'M VERY GRATEFUL TO 
19:10:42 HAVE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE A FEW WORDS.
I WANT TO SINCERELY THANK THE CITY OF 
19:10:46 FREMONT AND ITS LEADERSHIP FOR RECOGNIZING LGBTQ+ PRIDE MONTH.
THIS YEAR IT IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT 
19:10:52 THAT WE CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE TRANSGENDER COMMUNITY AS THEY CONTINUE THEIR STRUGGLE TO GAIN ACCEPTANCE IN 
19:10:59 VALIDATION.
IN 2021, AT LEAST 50 TRANS WOMEN WERE MURDERED IN THE UNITED STAIRKTS UP 
19:11:03 FROM AT LEAST 37 IN 2020.
THE TIME IS NOW TO END THE STIGMA, IGNORANCE AND HATE TOWARDS THIS 
19:11:08 COMMUNITY.
PUBLIC OPINION IS LEANING MORE TOWARDS ACCEPTANCE THAN EVER BEFORE OF THE 
19:11:13 LGBTQ+ COMMUNITY.
EVEN SO, THIS PRIDE MONTH IS A SOLEMN TIME DUE TO THE CONTINUED ATTACKS 
19:11:19 AGAINST THE LGBTQ+ COMMUNITY.
SOME STATES CONTINUE TO PROPOSE LEGISLATION THAT BLOCKS HEALTHCARE FOR 
19:11:25 TRANSGENDER  YOUTH, THUS PREVENTING CRUCIAL GENDER-AFFIRMING MEDICINE.
MEANWHILE, OTHER STATES ARE PASSING 
19:11:31 BILLS PROHIBITING THE DISCUSSION OF HOMOSEXUALITY IN CLASSROOMS, WIPING AWAY THE INCLUSION OF A PERCENTAGE OF 
19:11:39 EVERY STUDENT BODY.
THE HUMAN RIGHTS CAMPAIGN IDENTIFIED OVER 240 BILLS BY THE END OF MARCH OF 
19:11:43 2022 THAT WERE PROPOSED BY STATE LAWMAKERS ACROSS OUR NATION.
EVERY TIME ONE OF THESE BILLS IS 
19:11:50 INTRODUCED OR PASSED, IT SETS THE CLOCK BACK ON OUR PATHWAY TO TOTAL ACCEPTANCE, RETURNING AMERICANS TO 
19:11:56 OPPRESSIVE CONDITIONS OF BEING IN THE CLOSET, OPPRESSION NO MATTER WHAT THE AVENUE MAY BE, NO MATTER WHAT 
19:12:01 COMMUNITY IT MAY AFFECT, NO MATTER HOW LONG AGO IT MAY HAVE BEEN, IT SHOULD NEVER BE TOLERATED AND IT SHOULD NEVER 
19:12:07 BE F FORGOTTEN.
I WANT TO THANK YOU MAYOR MEI FOR READING THIS AND THE REST OF THE 
19:12:11 COUNCIL FOR THIS PROC LA NATION.
THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH AND HAPPY PRIDE MONTH.

19:12:15 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
REALLY APPRECIATE THE HUMAN RELATIONS COMMISSION FOR PARTNERING WITH US ON 
19:12:23 THIS.
NEXT IS ALSO A VERY SOLEMN PROCLAMATION FOR NATIONAL GUN VIOLENCE 
19:12:37 AWARENESS DAY, WHICH WAS ON JUNE 3RD, 2022.
ACCEPTING THE PROCLAMATION, I THINK 
19:12:39 WILL BE ALEX NAVARRO.
WONDERFUL.
THANK YOU.

19:12:46  WHEREAS, EVERY DAY, MORE THAN 100 AMERICANS ARE KILLED BY GUN VIOLENCE AND ON AVERAGE THERE ARE MORE THAN 
19:12:52 13,000 GUN HOMICIDES EVERY YEAR; AND WHEREAS, AMERICANS ARE 25 TIMES MORE LIKELY TO DIE BY GUN HOMICIDE THAN 
19:13:03 PEOPLE IN OTHER HIGH-INCOME COUNTRIES; AND WHEREAS, CALIFORNIA AVERAGES 3,160 GUN DEATHS EVERY YEAR, WITH A RATE OF 
19:13:13 7.8 DEATHS PER 100,000 PEOPLE. CALIFORNIA HAS THE 45TH HIGHEST RATE OF GUN DEATHS IN THE

19:13:30 UNITED STATES, AND WHEREAS, GUN HOMICIDES PREDOMINANTLY OCCUR IN CITIES, WITH MORE THAN HALF OF ALL 
19:13:32 FIREARM RELATED GUN DEATHS IN THE NATION OCCURRING IN 127 CITIES; AND WHEREAS, CITIES ACROSS THE NATION, 
19:13:35 INCLUDING IN FREMONT, ARE WORKING TO END THE SENSELESS VIOLENCE WITH EVIDENCE-BASED SOLUTIONS; AND WHEREAS, 
19:13:38 PROTECTING PUBLIC SAFETY IN THE COMMUNITIES THEY SERVE IS MAYORS' HIGHEST RESPONSIBILITY; AND WHEREAS, 
19:13:43 SUPPORT FOR THE SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS OF LAW-ABIDING CITIZENS GOES HAND-IN-HAND WITH KEEPING GUNS AWAY 
19:13:50 FROM PEOPLE WITH DANGEROUS HISTORIES; AND WHEREAS, MAYORS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS KNOW THEIR 
19:13:54 COMMUNITIES BEST ARE THE MOST FAMILIAR WITH LOCAL CRIMINAL ACTIVITY AND HOW TO ADDRESS IT, AND ARE BEST POSITIONED 
19:13:58 TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO KEEP THEIR CITIZENS SAFE; AND WHEREAS, THE PANDEMIC FACING AMERICA HAS 
19:14:07 DRASTICALLY IMPACTED COMMUNITIES AND INDIVIDUALS SHELTERING IN PLACE WHICH MAY RESULT IN SITUATIONS WHERE ACCESS 
19:14:14 TO FIREARMS RESULTS IN INCREASED RISK IN INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE GUN DEATHS, SUICIDE BY GUN AND 
19:14:25 UNINTENTIONAL SHOOTINGS; WHEREAS, IN JANUARY 2013, HADIYA PENDLETON, A TEENAGER WHO MARCHED IN THE 
19:14:29 PRESIDENTIAL INAUGURAL PARADE AND WAS TRAGICALLY SHOT AND KILLED JUST WEEKS LATER SHOULD BE NOW CELEBRATING HER 
19:14:36 23RD BIRTHDAY; AND WHEREAS, TO HELP HONOR HADIYA - AND THE MORE THAN 100 AMERICANS WHOSE LIVES ARE CUT SHORT 
19:14:47 EVERY DAY AND THE COUNTLESS SURVIVORS WHO ARE INJURED BY SHOOTINGS EVERY DAY - A NATIONAL COALITION OF 
19:14:56 ORGANIZATIONS HAS DESIGNATED JUNE 5, 2020, THE FIRST FRIDAY IN JUNE, AS THE 6TH NATIONAL GUN VIOLENCE AWARENESS 
19:15:06 DAY; AND WHEREAS, THE IDEA WAS INSPIRED BY HADIYA'S FRIENDS, WHO ASKED THEIR CLASSMATES TO COMMEMORATE HER LIFE BY 
19:15:10 WEARING ORANGE; THEY CHOSE THIS COLOR BECAUSE HUNTERS WEAR ORANGE TO ANNOUNCE THEMSELVES TO OTHER HUNTERS 
19:15:15 WHEN OUT IN THE WOODS AND ORANGE IS A COLOR THAT SYMBOLIZES THE VALUE OF HUMAN LIFE; AND NOW, THEREFORE, THE 
19:15:22 CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF FREMONT DECLARES THE FIRST FRIDAY IN JUNE, JUNE 3, 2022, TO BE NATIONAL GUN 
19:15:29 VIOLENCE AWARENESS DAY. I ENCOURAGE ALL CITIZENS TO SUPPORT THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITIES' EFFORTS TO PREVENT THE 
19:15:39 TRAGIC EFFECTS OF GUN VIOLENCE AND TO HONOR AND VALUE HUMAN LIVES.
SO ACCEPTING THE PROCLAMATION IS ALEX 
19:15:44 NAVARRO.
WELCOME.
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH, MAYOR MEI, AND

19:16:18 TODAY, AND MY HEART GOES OUT TO THE RECENT VICTIMS AND THEIR FAMILIES OF THE TRAGEDIES THAT WE'VE BEEN 
19:16:26 EXPERIENCING THROUGHOUT THE NATION, AND I KNOW THAT WE HAD THE U.S. CONFERENCE OF MAYORS LAST WEEK AND MANY OF MY 
19:16:33 FELLOW MAYORS AS WELL AS MANY COUNCIL MEMBERS HAVE STOOD IN SOLIDARITY ON THIS ISSUE SO WE APPRECIATE THESE 
19:16:35 CONTINUED EFFORTS.
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH.

19:18:49 >> Mayor Mei: YES, WE CAN.
>> THANK YOU.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

19:18:56 I WANT TO, ON BEHALF OF THE SANTA CLARA VALLEY SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING ASSOCIATION, TAKE THE TIME OUT OF YOUR 
19:19:06 BUSY SCHEDULE TO RECOGNIZE THE STEM WINNERS WHO WERE PARTICIPANT IN THE SYNOPSYS CHAMPIONSHIP IN 2021.

19:19:17 IT IS SIGNIFICANT FOR THEM, FOR THEY ARE OUR FUTURE, AND IT IS US WHO WILL BUILD THE FUTURE BY CULTIVATING THE 
19:19:27 STUDENTS AND GIVING THEM OPPORTUNITY TO EXPRESS THEIR IDEAS BEFORE US, AND WE PROVIDED THE TYPE OF ENCOURAGEMENT 
19:19:34 THAT THEY NEED AS THEY MOVE FORWARD.
AND I'M JUST SO HAPPY AND PLEASED THAT YOU AND THE COUNCILMEMBERS HAVE COME 
19:19:40 TO THIS CONCLUSION, AND THEY ARE ALL YOUR STUDENTS.
I MEAN, YOU'RE THE GOVERNING BODY FOR 
19:19:44 THEM.
THEY LIVE IN YOUR CITY.
AND WHEN THE CHILDREN ARE DOING THINGS 
19:19:53 THAT ARE POSITIVE, ESPECIALLY NOW WHEN WE WILL NEED THE INTELLECTUAL CAPACITY OF ALL THESE STUDENTS AND 
19:20:02 UNDERSTANDING SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING AND MATHEMATICS AND TECHNOLOGY, WE'LL NEED THOSE SKILLS AS WE MOVE FORWARD.

19:20:09 AND THE IMPROVEMENT AND ENHANCEMENTS THAT WE EXPERIENCE TODAY AND LOOK FORWARD TO TOMORROW, WE WILL

19:20:34 SUPPORT FOR SO MANY OF OUR TALENTED STUDENTS, AND THANK YOU, MR. WILLIAMS, I BELIEVE FOR YOUR SERVICE ALSO.

19:20:40 I BELIEVE YOU WERE ALSO A COUNCILMEMBER IF I'M CORRECT.
>> I WAS A COUNCILMEMBER FOR EIGHT 
19:20:47 YEARS FOR THE CITY OF SAN JOSÉ.
I WAS A SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER FOR 12 YEARS, AND I WAS A PLANNING 
19:21:01 COMMISSIONER FOR EIGHT YEARS.
SO I REALLY BELIEVE IN THE STUDENTS.
I REALLY BELIEVE EDUCATION IS A PRIME 
19:21:06 MOVER FOR THE FUTURE.
IT DOES A LOT OF GOOD FOR US  NOW.
THE PROBLEMS WE'RE FACING TODAY, THE 
19:21:14 CHILDREN HAVE ALREADY LOOKED AT SOLUTIONS, THEY JUST HAVE TO HAVE THE WHEREWITH AL AND ENCOURAGEMENT TO 
19:21:19 CONTINUE.
SO I'M PLEASED AND I'M HAPPY AND THEY JUST THRILL ME, THAT'S MY PASSION, IS 
19:21:27 ENGINEERING.
I'M AN ENGINEER, I WORKED FOR IBM FOR 35 YEARS, AND I HAVE A DOCTORATE 
19:21:34 DEGREE IN INTELLECTUAL ENGINEERING, BUT IT'S ALL ABOUT THE KIDS AND ABOUT THE FUTURE, AND ENCOURAGING THEM, 
19:21:44 SUPPORTING THEM, AND THIS SINGLE ACT OF YOUR RECOGNIZING THEM WILL MOVE THEM FORWARD, YOU CAN'T IMAGINE HOW MUCH 
19:21:52 BECAUSE OFTENTIMES PROJECTS ARE DISCOVERED, THEY'RE TALKED ABOUT, AND THEN THEY PUT THEM IN A CLOSET, NOBODY 
19:21:58 KNOWS ABOUT THEM.
BUT IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE, ALL THE RESIDENTS OF FREMONT AND BEYOND WILL 
19:22:07 KNOW BECAUSE YOUR MEETINGS WILL -- AS YOU BROADCAST THEM OUT TO THE COMMUNITY, THEY WILL KNOW ABOUT IT.

19:22:10 SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

>> WE HOPE TO BE HERE NEXT YEAR TOO.
>> Mayor Mei: I'M SURE WE --

19:22:25 >> YOU GUYS HAVE BRIGHT STUDENTS THERE IN FREMONT.
AND THEY'VE CHALLENGED, YOU KNOW, A 
19:22:33 LOT OF THE THINGS THAT ARE GOING ON IN TERMS OF TECHNOLOGY, I WAS IMPRESSED LAST YEAR WHEN ONE OF THE STUDENTS HAD 
19:22:48 -- YOU KNOW, THE IDEA OF AN AUTONOMOUS CAR AND ALSO THEY DISCUSSED THE MAG LEV TRAIN AND THE HEAT GENERATION AND 
19:22:55 HOW SOME OF THE TECHNOLOGY THEY'RE USING TODAY JUST WON'T GET IT, WON'T CUT IT, SO WE'VE GOT IDEAS OF HOW 
19:23:04 WE'RE GOING TO MAKE THAT BETTER.
THAT'S GOOD.
CAN'T YOU JUST IMAGINE A HIGH SCHOOL 
19:23:11 KID OR NEXT DOOR DOING THESE TYPES OF THINGS AND LOOKING TOWARD THE FUTURE.
>> Mayor Mei: WE'RE VERY HONORED TO 
19:23:15 HAVE YOU HERE THIS EVENING, WE'RE GLAD TO BE ABLE TO HEAR ABOUT THE STUDENTS AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING YOU NEXT 
19:23:19 YEAR.
>> ALL RIGHT.
WELL, THANK YOU AGAIN, AND THANK THE 
19:23:27 COUNCIL FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
NEXT ON OUR COUNCIL MEETING THIS 
19:23:33 EVENING IS PUBLIC  COMMUNICATIONS, ORAL COMMUNICATIONS ARE ITEMS THAT ARE NOT AGENDIZED THIS EVENING, AND ANY PERSON 
19:23:43 DESIRING TO SPEAK ON AN ITEM MAY DO SO BY RAISING THEIR HAND.
I SEE WITH HAVE A COUPLE  SPEAKERS 
19:23:47 THIS EVENING FOR THE PUBLIC NON-AGENDIZED ITEM.
WE'LL BEGIN WITH KELLY ABREU.

19:23:59 >> THANK YOU.
SO THE POLICE DEPARTMENT, A COUPLE OF THINGS ARE HAPPENING.

19:24:08 ONE WAS THE -- GOOD THINGS.
ONE WAS THE PROMOTION OF THE POLICE CHIEF, CHIEF SEAN WASHINGTON, A GREAT 
19:24:18 PROMOTION, AND NOW I JUST HEARD THAT THE CITY IS MAKING A WONDERFUL NEW HIRE, BRINGING IN A CAPTAIN LANCE 
19:24:25 BRIED FROM THE EAST BAY REGIONAL PARK DISTRICT, WHOM WE AT MISSION PEAK CONSERVANCY, WE KNOW CAPTAIN BRIED 
19:24:31 VERY WELL AND HE'S HIGHLY RESPECTED, SO THIS IS GOING TO BE A GREAT ADDITION, A GREAT ADDITION TO THE FREMONT POLICE 
19:24:37 DEPARTMENT AT THE TOP LEVELS OF MANAGEMENT.
BUT THE FREMONT POLICE DEPARTMENT NOT 
19:24:46 ONLY AS THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER WAS SAYING,  HE'S TALKING ABOUT THE BELIEF IN THE YOUTH AND BELIEF IN THE SCIENCE 
19:24:56 AND THE TECHNOLOGY,  WELL, I'D LIKE TO SUGGEST THAT WE NEED REALLY A DEEP BELIEF IN THE ACCOUNTANTS AND THE 
19:25:06 FINANCIAL MANAGERS OVER THERE, WITH RESPECT TO THE RED LIGHT CAMERAS.
NOW, THESE RED LIGHT CAMERAS, OVER THE 
19:25:15 LAST YEAR OR SO, LAST YEAR, YOU KNOW, IF YOU GO DOWN THE LIST, THERE'S 12 OF THEM, AND I'LL JUST READ THEM OFF.

19:25:26 ONE OF THEM MADE $10,000 AT THE SITE.
ANOTHER ONE MADE 5,000.
ANOTHER ONE MADE 17,000.

19:25:30 THEN THERE ARE A LOT OF THEM, MOST OF THEM, THEY LOST MONEY.
WHY?

19:25:41 BECAUSE YOU'RE PAYING $48,000 A PIECE PER YEAR AS A FIXED FEE.
SO WHY ARE YOU -- THE OTHER ONE OF 
19:25:51 THEM LOST 24,000, 35,000, 40,000, 29,000, 18,000, 42,000, AND $3,000 AT THE OTHER SEVEN LOCATIONS.

19:25:59 NOW THERE ARE TWO LOCATIONS THAT ARE FANTASTICALLY PROFITABLE, WHERE THE AVERAGE TICKET BRINGS IN, TO THE CITY, 
19:26:04 $45 A PIECE.
$45.
OF COURSE THE PEOPLE ARE PAYING $490, 
19:26:16 BUT THE CITY IS GETTING $45 OF THAT.
AND THAT -- THE CITY HAS WRACKED UP -- AT CHRISTY, IT RACKED OF $350,000, A 
19:26:23 PACIFIC COMMONS, HALF A MILLION DOLLARS.
BUT THE OTHER 10 WERE LOSING $180,000 
19:26:32 IF YOU ADDED  UP ALL THOSE NUMBERS.
SO THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTANTS SEEM TO COME IN WITH VERY SHARP PENCILS.

19:26:39 THEY NEED TO TAKE A LOOK AT THOSE 10 RED LIGHT CAMERAS AND ASK THE CITY, CAN WE SAVE SOME MONEY BY CUTTING OUT 
19:26:46  THOSE RED LIGHT CAMERAS, WE CAN SAVE $180,000 A YEAR.
THAT'S A REALLY NICE BENEFIT.

19:26:51 AND JUST GO AFTER THOSE COSTCO SHOPPERS AND REALLY RAKE IN THE BIG PROFITS THERE.

19:26:56 I DON'T THINK IT'S SUCH A GREAT IDEA, BUT IT IS HIGHLY PROFITABLE TO GO AFTER THOSE SHOPPERS.

19:27:09 THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
NEXT ON OUR SPEAKERS IS MARIE H.

19:27:14 WELCOME, MARIE.
>> THANK YOU.
THIS IS MARIE HUGHES FROM NILES, AND A 
19:27:21 MEMBER OF FREMONT FOR EVERYONE.
FOR A LONG TIME, THERE WAS AN RV ENCAMPMENT IN THE PARK ACROSS FROM MY 
19:27:24 STREET.
PEOPLE COMPLAINED BITTERLY ABOUT IT.
NOT ME, OTHER PEOPLE.

19:27:31 AND EVENTUALLY IT WAS CLEARED.
DID THAT SOLVE THE PROBLEMS?
WELL, NOW THERE'S A SMALL TENT 
19:27:38 ENCAMPMENT THERE, AND IT IS  GROWING.
THIS SHOWS TO ME THAT YOU CAN'T SOLVE HOMELESSNESS BY CLEARING HOMELESS 
19:27:43 ENCAMPMENTS.
MAYBE THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO COMPLAINED ABOUT VALEO MILLS PARK ARE HAPPY, FOR 
19:27:49 A WHILE, ANYWAY, BUT THE PEOPLE IN RVs THAT WERE THERE, THEY WENT SOMEWHERE, AND I DOUBT THE PEOPLE IN THE 
19:27:53 NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE THEY ENDED UP ARE HAPPY NOW.
IN MY OPINION, THE WAY TO SOLVE 
19:28:00 HOMELESSNESS IS TO GET PEOPLE OFF THE STREETS AND INTO PERMANENT SHELTER.
THIS IS WHY PROGRAMS SUCH AS FREMONT'S 
19:28:06 SAFE PARKING PROGRAM AND PROJECT HOMEKEY ARE SO IMPORTANT.
PROJECT HOMEKEY IN PARTICULAR GIVES 
19:28:12 AFFORDABLE HOUSING TO PEOPLE WHO WERE HOMELESS BUT NOW HAVE A PLACE TO LIVE AND COUNSELORS TO HELP THEM WITH THEIR 
19:28:18 PROBLEMS, AND TO PEOPLE IN DANGER OF BECOMING HOMELESS.
THE SAFE PARKING PROGRAM DOES NOT GET 
19:28:25 PEOPLE INTO PERMANENT HOUSING IMMEDIATELY, BUT BY  GIVING PEOPLE IN CARS A SAFE PLACE TO SLEEP, THE CITY 
19:28:32 IS IMPROVING THEIR LIVES AND BY PROVIDING WRAPAROUND SERVICES THEY ARE GETTING A PATH OUT OF HOMELESSNESS AND 
19:28:37 SOME OF THE MEMBERS OF THE PROGRAM HAVE FOUND PERMANENT HOUSING.
SO FOR ME, I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY 
19:28:43 PEOPLE WITH OPPOSE THESE PROGRAMS, GIVEN THAT THEY DO WHAT WE NEED, WHICH IS TO GET PEOPLE OFF THE STREET, BUT 
19:28:49 THEY DO.
FOR A LONG TIME, I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND, BUT NOW I THINK I  DO.

19:28:56 THESE PEOPLE ARE AFRAID.
THEY'VE HAD BAD EXPERIENCES WITH PEOPLE ON THE STREET WHO ARE 
19:29:00 UNHOUSED.
MAYBE THEY'VE BEEN ACCOSTED FOR MONEY OR THEY'VE SEEN MENTALLY ILL PEOPLE 
19:29:06 BEING KIND OF  MENACING, AND THEY THINK THAT'S WHAT THESE PROGRAMS MEAN.
BUT IN FACT, THESE PROGRAMS TAKE 
19:29:11 PEOPLE OFF THE STREETS, AND THAT MAKES EVERYONE SAFER.
IT MAKES THE UNHOUSED SAFER AND IT 
19:29:18 MAKES THE NEIGHBORS SAFER AS WELL.
SO THANK YOU, CITY COUNCIL, FOR SUPPORTING THESE PROGRAMS, AND THANKS 
19:29:24 TO CITY STAFF FOR DESIGNING AND RUNNING THEM.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:29:31 NEXT SPEAKER IS MANAAL SHAFI.

19:32:20 THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
AND I BELIEVE THAT IS OUR LAST PUBLIC 
19:32:23 SPEAKER.
I'D LIKE TO CLOSE THE PUBLIC COMMENTS.

19:32:30  FOR ORAL  COMMUNICATIONS.
NEXT I'M GOING TO HAVE ITEM 5A, WHICH IS THE PUBLIC HEARING FOR PROPOSED 
19:32:40 ANNUAL ASSESSMENT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2022 AND 23 OF FREMONT LANDSCAPING ASSESSMENT FOR DISTRICT NUMBER 88.

19:32:50 AND I'M GOING TO ACTUALLY TEMPORARILY EXIT THIS BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT I AM WITHIN THE AREA OF DISTRICT NUMBER 
19:32:57 88.
I'M JUST GOING TO TURN THIS OVER TEMPORARILY, I THINK, TO VICE MAYOR 
19:33:04 SALWAN, BUT I THINK YOU ALSO MAY LIVE IN THE DISTRICT, SO WE'RE GOING TO TURN IT OVER TO COUNCILMEMBER JONES, 
19:33:14 WHO I SEE NEXT ON MY SCREEN.
SO I WILL TEMPORARILY RECEDE THE GOVERNANCE FOR UNTIL THIS ITEM IS 
19:33:17 OVER.
>> City Mgr. Shackelford:COUNCI LMEMBER JONES, WE DON'T HAVE A 
19:33:22 PRESENTATION THIS EVENING, BUT STAFF IS AVAILABLE FOR ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE  COUNCILMEMBERS.

19:33:31 AND WE HAVE BUSINESS MANAGER ANDREW FREEMAN FROM COMMUNITY SERVICES AS WELL AS COMMUNITY SERVICES DIRECTOR 
19:33:35 SUZANNE WOLF AVAILABLE.
>> Councilmember Jones: OKAY, THANK YOU.

19:33:41 SO I WILL OPEN THE PUBLIC HEARING ON THIS ITEM, AND ASK MS. GAUTHIER IF THERE ARE ANY SPEAKERS?

19:33:45  FROM THE PUBLIC?
>> Ms. Gauthier: THERE ARE NO HANDS RAISED.

19:33:50 >> Councilmember Jones: OKAY.
WITH THAT WE'LL CLOSE THE PUBLIC HEARING AND TURN IT BACK TO THE 
19:34:00 COUNCIL FOR ANY DISCUSSION THAT ANY OF YOU MAY RAISE.
NO HANDS UP, I'M ASSUMING?

19:34:03 >> Ms. Gauthier: NO HANDS  RAISED, SIR.
>> Councilmember Jones: OKAY.

19:34:07 WITH THAT, I WILL ENTERTAIN A MOTION TO PASS STAFF RECOMMENDATION ON THIS ITEM.

19:34:23 >> Councilmember Cox: SO MOVE.
>> Ms. Gauthier: DO WE HAVE A SECOND?
>> Councilmember Jones: CAN I SECOND?

19:34:29 >> Ms. Gauthier: YOU CAN.
>> Councilmember Jones: I CAN.
ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE.

19:34:32 >> Ms. Gauthier: COUNCILMEMBER COX, AYE.
COUNCILMEMBER SHAO, AYE.

19:34:39 COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, AYE.
COUNCILMEMBER JONES, AYE.
COUNCILMEMBER KENG, AYE.

19:34:51 VICE MAYOR SALWAN AND MAYOR MEI ARE LISTED AS ABSTAINING.


19:34:55 >> Councilmember Jones: THANK YOU, MS. GAUTHIER.
IF WE CAN BRING MAYOR MEI AND VICE 
19:35:00 MAYOR SALWAN --
>> WE SHOULD MARK THEM AS ABSENT BECAUSE TECHNICALLY THEY WERE NOT 
19:35:02 PRESENT FOR THAT ITEM.
>> Ms. Gauthier: OKAY.
THANK YOU.

19:35:13 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
NEXT IS ITEM 5B, WHICH IS THE FIRST PUBLIC HEARING ON THE FISCAL YEAR 
19:35:19 2022/23 PROPOSED OPERATING BUDGET.
AND THIS EVENING I'D LIKE TO WELCOME OUR FINANCE DIRECTOR, DAVE PERSSELIN, 
19:35:27 WHO WILL SHARE A PRESENTATION.
THANK YOU.
>> Mr. Persselin: THANK YOU, MAYOR 
19:35:28 MEI.
TONIGHT WE DO NOT ACTUALLY HAVE A PRESENTATION.

19:35:39 WE SIMPLY ARE STANDING BY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS AND FEEDBACK FROM THE CITY COUNCIL AFTER THE PUBLIC HEARING.

19:35:49 >> Mayor Mei: OKAY.
ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE COUNCILMEMBERS BEFORE WE OPEN THE 
19:36:01 PUBLIC HEARING?
I DON'T SEE ANY HANDS RAISED.
>> Ms. Gauthier: COUNCILMEMBER SHAO 
19:36:04 JUST RAISED A HAND.
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY.
I WAS GOING TO CLOSE THE PUBLIC 
19:36:08 HEARING AND BRING IT BACK TO THE COUNCIL, BUT I GUESS COUNCILMEMBERS FOR QUESTIONS.

19:36:12 WE'LL BEGIN WITH COUNCILMEMBER SHAO.
>> Councilmember Shao: THANK  YOU, MAYOR.

19:36:20 DIRECTOR PERSSELIN, I JUST WANT TO CONFIRM FOR THE PUBLIC THAT THE CITY IS STILL SETTING AROUND $3 MILLION 
19:36:26 ASIDE FOR THE UNFUNDED LIABILITY PAYMENT.
IS THAT CORRECT?

19:36:32 >> Mr. Persselin: THAT'S  CORRECT, COUNCILMEMBER SHAO.
THE PROPOSED OPERATING BUDGET FOR NEXT 
19:36:39 FISCAL YEAR DOES, IN FACT, SET ASIDE APPROXIMATELY $3 MILLION AS AN ADDITIONAL CONTRIBUTION TO PAY DOWN 
19:36:45 OUR UNFUNDED PENSION LIABILITIES.
>> Councilmember Shao: THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO ASK.

19:36:56 THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: ARE THERE  CLARIFYING QUESTIONS FROM THE COUNCIL AT THIS 
19:37:07 TIME ON THE OPERATING BUDGET?
SEEING NONE FROM THE COUNCILMEMBERS, I'LL JUST MAKE A GENERAL COMMENT, 
19:37:14 WHICH IS I APPRECIATE WE HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED IN PAST PRACTICE AS BEING FISCALLY SOLVENT AND RESPONSIBLE IN 
19:37:20 OUR PAST REVIEWS, SO I WANTED TO SHARE THAT WITH DIRECTOR PERSSELIN AND WITH THIS TEAM, THAT WE APPRECIATE THIS 
19:37:27 CONTINUED EFFORTS, AND ALSO REGARDING THE QUESTIONS OF UNFUNDED LIABILITIES, THAT WHILE IT CHALLENGING AT TIMES TO 
19:37:33 HAVE TO MAKE BUDGET CUTS, IT'S ALSO CHALLENGING IN TIMES TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE BEING FORWARD THINKING AND WE HAVE 
19:37:41 IN THE PAST PRACTICE AS A COUNCIL ADOPTED THOSE TYPES OF POLICIES THAT ALLOW US TO BE SOLVENT AND IN 
19:37:44 PARTICULAR ADDRESSING UNFUNDED LIABILITIES.
SO AT THIS TIME, I'M GOING TO CLOSE 
19:37:50 THE PUBLIC HEARING.
>> Ms. Gauthier: WE NEED TO OPEN THE PUBLIC HEARING.

19:37:54 WE HAVE SPEAKERS.
>> Mayor Mei: I THOUGHT I OPENED IT EARLIER, BEFORE COUNCILMEMBER SHAO, 
19:37:58 BUT I CAN OPEN IT AGAIN, AND I'LL WAIT FOR A FEW MINUTES TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY COMMENTS AT THIS TIME FROM THE 
19:38:01 PUBLIC.
>> Ms. Gauthier: WE HAVE TWO HANDS RAISED.

19:38:06 LIN MILLER AND KELLY ABREU.
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY.
I DID NOT SEE THAT.

19:38:13 THANK YOU.
LYNN, WELCOME.
>> THANK YOU, MAYOR MEI.

19:38:19 CAN YOU HEAR ME?
>> Mayor Mei: YES, WE CAN.
THANK YOU, LYNN.

19:38:26 >> ALL RIGHTY.
I REPRESENT THE COMMUNITY  NON-PROFIT TRI-CITY URBAN FOREST ALLIANCE NOW 
19:38:33 RENAMED URBAN FOREST FRIENDS BECAUSE IT'S MUCH SIMPLER.
WE HAVE PARTNERED WITH THE CITY OF 
19:38:39 FREMONT WORKING ON THE URBAN FOREST MASTER PLAN AND HAVE BEEN DOING COMMUNITY TREE PLANTING PROJECTS WITH 
19:38:48 THE CITY OF FREMONT AND OTHER NON-PROFIT PARTNERS WHO THE PAST 30 MONTHS, I HAVE SEEN HOW HELPFUL AND 
19:38:57 DEDICATED THE PARKS STAFF ARE.
THE COMMUNITY SERVICES DEPARTMENT UNDER SUZANNE'S LEADERSHIP PLANS TO 
19:39:05 EXPAND VOLUNTEER OPPORTUNITIES TO HELP CARE FOR OUR CITY'S URBAN  FOREST, AND WE ARE HOPEFUL TO BEGIN AN URBAN 
19:39:15 FOREST ACADEMY FOR CITIZENS TO   -- AND FACILITATE COMMUNITY EDUCATION ABOUT THE MANY, MANY BENEFITS OF TREES.

19:39:26 YOU, THE CITY COUNCIL, UNFORTUNATELY HAVE INHERITED A LONG-AGO SHIFT FROM THE CITY MANAGED TREES TO PROPERTY 
19:39:34 OWNER MANAGED TREES, AND A DISCONTINUATION OF TREE ORDINANCE ENFORCEMENT.

19:39:42 WELL, THE CHICKEN HAS COME HOME TO ROOST.
FREMONT HAS MANY HOUSING TRACKS BUILT 
19:39:51 IN THE 50s, 60s AND 70s THAT HAD TREELINED  STREETS.
THOSE STREETS ARE GONE, JUST SPORADIC 
19:39:59 TREES REMAIN.
ONLY NEW NEIGHBORHOODS SPORT THE GREEN CANOPY OF SHADY TREES.

19:40:07 WORKING WITH THE PUBLIC, WE MEET RESIDENTS WHO MOVED ON TO A PARTICULAR STREET BECAUSE OF THE LOVELY TREES, 
19:40:20 AND WE ARE -- THEY LAMENT OVER THE THINNING CANOPY.
PLEASE PHASE IN TREES WHERE CC & Rs 
19:40:26 GOOD FOR PERPETUITY AND ORDINANCES DICTATE THEY BE.
YES, BOTH THE CAP AND THE URBAN FOREST 
19:40:34 MASTER PLAN ARE ROLLING OUT SOON, AND BOTH WILL STRONGLY RECOMMEND NEIGHBORHOOD BUSINESS ENFORCEMENT.

19:40:43 SURVEYS FROM BOTH PLANS DEMONSTRATE A STRONG DESIRE FOR TREES.
WE ASK FOR ONE FULL TIME CODE 
19:40:50 ENFORCEMENT ARBORIST AS STRONGLY ADVISED IN THE URBAN FOREST MASTER PLAN THIS YEAR BE IN THE BUDGET SO 
19:40:57 THAT ANOTHER YEAR IS NOT LOST.
ONLY YOU, THE CITY COUNCIL, CAN TURN THIS BOAT AROUND.

19:41:05 THANK YOU SO MUCH.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU, LYNN.
THE NEXT SPEAKER I THINK IS KELLY 
19:41:11 ABREU.
WELCOME.
>> YEAH, SO IF YOU LOOK AT THE 
19:41:19 ECONOMIC OUTLOOK IN THIS REPORT, IT SEEMS TO POINT -- IT SEEMS TO BE RATHER SANGUINE, AND THIS SANGUINITY 
19:41:25 IS RATHER UNSUBSTANTIATED OR UNFOUNDED.
IF YOU LOOK AT THE -- WHAT THE WORLD 
19:41:33 BANK IS SAYING, THAT THE RECESSION WILL BE HARD TO AVOID FOR MANY COUNTRIES THIS YEAR, IF YOU LOOK AT THE ATLANTA 
19:41:41 FEDERAL RESERVE, GDP NOW TRACKER, IT'S POINTING TO THE POSSIBILITY OF A SECOND CONSECUTIVE ORDER OF NEGATIVE 
19:41:48 GROWTH THAT WOULD MEET THE DEFINITION FOR A RECESSION.
BUT -- SO THERE IS SOME CONCERN ABOUT 
19:41:56 RECESSION.
THEN IF YOU LOOK AT THE INFLATION NUMBERS, THEY'RE  EYE-POPPING, 
19:42:03 EYEBROW-RAISING.
 INFLATION NUMBERS THAT ARE HAPPENING OUT THERE.
SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE MACRO PICTURE 
19:42:15 AND THEN YOU BRING IT IN TO THE CITY, IT'S NOT, YOU  KNOW -- THEY'RE NOT CALM WINDS, THEY'RE NOT TAILWINDS.

19:42:20 THESE ARE HEADWINDS OBVIOUSLY.
THAT DOESN'T SHOW UP IN THE REPORT VERY MUCH.

19:42:29 AND SECONDLY, GOING BACK TO THE PROJECT THAT I WAS POINTING OUT EARLIER, A LOT OF THESE PROJECTS THAT THE CITY IS 
19:42:38 DOING, FOR EXAMPLE, RED LIGHT CAMERAS THAT ARE BEING SOLD, SOLD A BILL OF GOODS AS BEING SOME KIND OF 
19:42:45 PROFIT-MAKING ENTITY, WHEN, IN FACT, THEY SHOULD BE A  SAFETY-MAKING ENTITY AND EVEN THAT'S UNPROVEN, BUT THE 
19:42:57  PROFIT-MAKING ABILITY OF 10 OUT OF 12 OF THESE THINGS IS NEGATIVE.
NEGATIVE PROFITS, SO THAT MEANS WE'RE 
19:43:03 LOSING MONEY ON A LOT OF THESE RED LIGHT CAMERAS, AND THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE OF A FOCUS IN TERMS OF LET'S NOT 
19:43:08 FOOL OURSELVES INTO DOING THINGS THAT COST OUR MOTORISTS A LOT OF MONEY, AND DON'T MAKE THE CITY ANY MONEY.

19:43:18 IN FACT, WE'RE LOSING MONEY FROM THE CITY RESIDENTS' POINT OF VIEW.
SO YEAH, I'D SAY THIS REPORT IS A 
19:43:29 LITTLE BIT TOO OPTIMISTIC ON THE ECONOMY, A LITTLE BIT -- PERHAPS SOME OF THE ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE BAKED IN 
19:43:41 AREN'T  REALLY -- ARE A LITTLE BIT TOO OPTIMISTIC, AND AS TIME GOES ON, WE'LL SEE IF MY RATHER MORE TAME AND 
19:43:49 CONSERVATIVE VIEW IS CORRECT OR WHETHER THE AUTHORS OF THIS REPORT AND THEIR OPTIMISM, WHETHER THAT IS CORRECT.

19:43:54 WE'LL SEE IN THE FUTURE.
PREDICTING THE FUTURE IS HARD.
THANK YOU.

19:44:01 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
I BELIEVE THAT WAS THE LAST PUBLIC COMMENT SPEAKER ON THIS ITEM.

19:44:07 AND I'LL CLOSE THE --
>> Ms. Gauthier: STEVE SKALA HAS HIS HAND RAISED.

19:44:10 >> Mayor Mei: OKAY.
MY APOLOGIES.
WELCOME, STEVE.

19:44:17 >> HI, WELCOME.
STEVE SKALA, RESIDENT OF  FREMONT.
JUST A REQUEST, PERHAPS A CLARIFYING 
19:44:28 REQUEST FOR STAFF.
SO TRANSPORTATION SPENDING HAS BEEN SOMEWHAT CONTENTIOUS RECENTLY IN THE 
19:44:34 COMMUNITY.
MANY PEOPLE QUESTION WHETHER BUDGET IS BETTER SPENT FOR INFRASTRUCTURE, WHICH 
19:44:44 IS ACTUALLY CAPITAL VERSUS OTHER ITEMS ENFORCEMENT.
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE BUDGET, YOU HAVE 
19:44:52 A BIT OF A MIX IN THE DESCRIPTION OF WHAT WAS ACCOMPLISHED, SOME ITEMS OF CAPITAL ARE KIND OF MIXED IN WITH THE 
19:45:00 BUDGET.
I THINK IT WOULD BE USEFUL OR I'LL ASK IF YOU CAN BE QUITE CLEAR IN WHICH 
19:45:09 EXPENDITURES ARE ACTUALLY CAPITAL, COMING FROM OUTSIDE SOURCES, AND WHICH ARE FROM THE ACTUAL BUDGET.

19:45:17 AND I THINK MOST PEOPLE IN THE MEETING PROBABLY KNOW THE DIFFERENCE AND CAN TELL, BUT IF YOU'RE NOT THAT FAMILIAR, 
19:45:26 IT CAN BE A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO KNOW WHAT EXACTLY IS BEING BUDGETED FROM OUR REVENUE AND WHAT'S BEING DONE AS 
19:45:31 CAPITAL FROM OUTSIDE GRANTS.
SO AGAIN, IF YOU CAN TRY TO CLARIFY THAT A BIT, I THINK IT WOULD BE 
19:45:37 HELPFUL FOR EVERYBODY.
THANKS.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:45:46 I JUST WANTED TO CHECK ONE MORE TIME --
>> Ms. Gauthier: THAT WAS THE LAST 
19:45:47 SPEAKER.
YOU CAN CLOSE.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:45:56 I WILL CLOSE THE PUBLIC HEARING, AND I APPRECIATE ALL FOR JOINING US FOR THE BUDGET COMMENTS, AND I WILL TURN IT 
19:46:04 BACK TO THE COUNCIL TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS.
OKAY.

19:46:12 SEEING NONE, THIS IS AN INFORMATIONAL ITEM, AND WE'LL RESUME -- AND WE WILL HAVE ADDITIONAL BUDGET CONVERSATIONS, 
19:46:19 AND THOSE ARE PROVIDED AND I APPRECIATE OUR NEW WEBSITE, WHICH WAS RECENTLY LAUNCHED, THAT WE'LL BE PROVIDING SOME 
19:46:25 OF THAT INFORMATION TO LET PEOPLE KNOW TO BOTH LOOK AT THE WEBSITE AND ALSO TO SUBSCRIBE.

19:46:30 AND WE HAVE NO ADDITIONAL COUNCIL REFERRALS.
ARE THERE ANY REPORTS ON MEETINGS THAT 
19:46:39 ARE COMING OUT FROM THE COMMISSIONS THAT YOU WERE ASSIGNED?
OKAY.

19:46:43 SEEING NONE, AT THIS TIME, I WILL ADJOURN THE MEETING --
>> Councilmember Kassan: I'M SORRY, I 
19:46:48 JUST WANTED TO MAKE A REALLY QUICK REPORT.
I JUST WANTED TO MENTION THAT I WENT 
19:46:56 TO THE FIRST NIGHT OF THE SAFE PARKING PROGRAM AT CHRIST THE KING LUTHERAN CHURCH, AND I JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT 
19:47:07 THERE WERE STAFF MEMBERS THERE AND I WAS JUST SO IMPRESSED WITH OUR STAFF.
I THINK OUR HOMELESSNESS STAFF IS JUST 
19:47:11 SO PROFESSIONAL, AND THE EVENING WENT REALLY, REALLY  WELL.
SO I JUST WANTED TO THANK  EVERYONE 
19:47:17 FOR THAT.
>> Mayor Mei: NO, THANK YOU, COUNCILMEMBER, FOR SHARING THAT 
19:47:21 INFORMATION.
I THINK IT IS EXCELLENT THAT WE HAVE SUCH INCREDIBLE, DEDICATED STAFF, AND 
19:47:29 IT IS A KEY AREA THAT WE ARE FOCUSING ON WITHIN OUR COUNCIL PRIORITIES.
AND SO I APPRECIATE YOU SHARING THAT 
19:47:35 INFORMATION.
SEEING NO OTHER ADDITIONAL COMMENTS AT THIS TIME, I'D LIKE TO ADJOURN THE 
19:47:41 MEETING, AND I'D LIKE TO -- BEFORE WE ADJOURN THE MEETING, I'D JUST LIKE TO PAUSE FOR A MOMENT.

19:47:47 WE TALKED EARLIER THIS EVENING ABOUT GUN VIOLENCE, AND IF IT'S OKAY, MY REQUEST THAT WE PAUSE IN A MOMENT OF 
19:47:53  SILENCE FOR ALL THOSE WHO HAVE LOST THEIR LIVES THIS PAST TWO WEEKS IN PARTICULAR IN GUN VIOLENCE, AND I 
19:48:14 APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
I APPRECIATE THAT.

19:48:20 AND I APPRECIATE THE PARTNERSHIP IN WORKING WITH ALL OF YOU AND LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING YOU NEXT WEEK.

19:48:24 BE WELL, BE SAFE AND BE HEALTHY.
TAKE CARE.
THANK YOU TO ALL THE STAFF TOO.
