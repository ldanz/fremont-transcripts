 SUPPORT OUR SMALL BUSINESSES AND MERCHANTS ON SMALL BUSINESS SATURDAY
19:20:53 .
I SEE ACCEPTING TODAY WILL BE CINDY AND
19:20:56  JASMINE.
THANK YOU.
>> THANK YOU, MAYOR MEI
19:21:00  AND CITY COUNCILMEMBERS.
THE CHAMBER IS
19:21:03  DELIGHTED TO BE HERE WITH YOU THIS EVENING, ESPECIALLY SINCE IT'S
19:21:06  NATIONAL ENTREPRENEURS DAY, AND
19:21:10  HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO RECOGNIZE SMALL BUSINESSES ON SATURDAY, NOVEMBER
19:21:13  27TH.
IT'S
19:21:16  ESPECIALLY AN IMPORTANT DAY TO CELEBRATE SMALL BUSINESSES IN OUR
19:21:19  COMMUNITY.
SMALL BUSINESSES ARE A LARGE PART OF OUR COMMUNITY AND ARE IMPORTANT
19:21:22  BECAUSE THEY OFFER OPPORTUNITIES FOR ENTREPRENEURS
19:21:26  TO FOSTER INNOVATION.
EVERY TIME A
19:21:29  SMALL BUSINESS OWNER OPENS A BUSINESS IN OUR COMMUNITY, THERE IS A
19:21:32   RISK-TAKING ENTREPRENEUR  FOLLOWING HIS OR HER
19:21:35  DREAM OR PASSION.
THE FREMONT CHAMBER IS COMMITTED TO PROMOTING
19:21:39  SMALL BUSINESS AND RAISING AWARENESS OF THE IMPORTANCE
19:21:42  OF SMALL BUSINESS IN OUR COMMUNITY.
TO ILLUSTRATE THIS, I HAVE A FEW STATISTICS
19:21:45  AND POINTS JUST TO SHARE WITH YOU.

19:21:49 THERE ARE 30.7 MILLION SMALL BUSINESSES
19:21:52  IN THE U.S., WHICH ACCOUNT FOR
19:21:55  99.9% OF ALL U.S. BUSINESSES.
SMALL BUSINESSES
19:21:58  ACCOUNT FOR APPROXIMATELY 60% OF THE GROSS
19:22:01  DOMESTIC PRODUCT IN THE UNITED STATES.

19:22:05 SMALL BUSINESSES CREATE 75% OF THE NET NEW JOBS IN OUR
19:22:08  ECONOMY.
THEY ARE ALSO JOB CREATION  POWERHOUSES
19:22:11  AND ENABLE MINORITY GROUPS AND WOMEN TO MAKE
19:22:14  AN IMPACT IN THE BUSINESS MORE EASILY.

19:22:18 THEIR IMPORTANCE TO THE LOCAL COMMUNITY IS CRITICAL FOR EVERY
19:22:21  $100 SPENT IN A LOCALLY OWNED BUSINESS, $68 WILL STAY IN THE COMMUNITY.

19:22:26 LOCAL BUSINESS OWNERS ARE OUR NEIGHBORS AND HAVE CONSISTENTLY
19:22:29  BEEN PROVEN TO DONATE TO COMMUNITY CAUSES AT MORE THAN TWICE
19:22:32  THE RATE OF LARGER BUSINESSES.
THE
19:22:35  FREMONT CHAMBER IS REALLY PROUD TO SERVE THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY AND WE ARE
19:22:38  COMMITTED TO WORK HARD TO SERVE THOSE WHO TAKE
19:22:41  RISKS AND FOLLOW THEIR PASSION.
WE ARE HONORED TO BE HERE TODAY TO CELEBRATE
19:22:44  THEIR COURAGE AND SUCCESS.
AND BEFORE I TURN IT OVER TO JASMINE,
19:22:48  I JUST WANT TO THANK COUNCILMEMBER TERESA COX FOR FACILITATING
19:22:51  THIS AWARD AND CELEBRATING SMALL BUSINESSES
19:22:54 , AS WELL AS EACH OF THE CITY COUNCILMEMBERS FOR
19:22:56  THE
RECOGNITION AND SUPPORT OF SMALL BUSINESSES.

19:23:00 YOU MEANING THE CITY COUNCIL AND THE FREMONT
19:23:05  STAFF HAVE SHOWN AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF SUPPORT FOR SMALL BUSINESSES AND
19:23:09  THE CHAMBER OVER THE YEARS.
WE WANT
19:23:12  TO ENCOURAGE ALL OF OUR COMMUNITY TO SHOP AND SUPPORT
19:23:15  LOCAL SMALL BUSINESSES DURING THE HOLIDAY SEASON, AS WELL AS
19:23:19  THROUGHOUT THE YEAR.
IT'S BECOME CRITICALLY IMPORTANT AS WE CONTINUE
19:23:22  TO RECOVER.
WITH THAT, I'M GOING TO TURN IT OVER TO JASMINE
19:23:25 .
>> 
19:23:27 THANK YOU.
CAN YOU GUYS HEAR ME?
I'M SURE YOU CAN.

19:23:31 SO THANK YOU AGAIN, MAYOR MEI, COUNCILMEMBERS
19:23:34 , TERESA COX, THANK YOU FOR PUTTING THIS PROC PLA LAMATION
19:23:38  PROCLAMATION TOGETHER.

19:23:41 AS A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER, THIS MEANS SO MUCH TO ME, MY STAFF AND
19:23:43  OTHER SMALL BUSINESSES BECAUSE YOU'RE RECOGNIZING OUR CONTRIBUTIONS TO FREMONT.

19:23:47 I KNOW SOME OF THE  COUNCILMEMBERS ARE ALSO SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS
19:23:50 , SO IT'S JUST SO IMPORTANT THAT WE SUPPORT OUR
19:23:53  OWN.
SMALL BUSINESSES ARE THE BACKBONES OF ANY COMMUNITY, AND
19:23:56  THE COUNCIL SUPPORT JUST  AMPLIFIES OUR EFFORTS TO
19:23:59  GIVE BACK.
AS CINDY MENTIONED, WE GIVE BACK
19:24:03  IN SPADES BECAUSE THIS IS WHERE OUR CHILDREN ARE GOING TO  SCHOOL, THIS IS
19:24:06  WHERE OUR STAFF MEMBERS ARE WORKING, THIS
19:24:09  IS WHERE THEY LIVE.
THEY WANT TO WORK FOR
19:24:13  A COMMUNITY AND THEY WANT TO BE IN A COMMUNITY THAT SUPPORTS THEM.
SO THANK YOU SO MUCH
19:24:16  FOR  SUPPORTING US AND OUR STAFF, BECAUSE I THINK THIS GOES A LONG WAY
19:24:19  IN SHOWING OUR STAFF THAT THE CITY ACTUALLY SUPPORTS
19:24:23  US.
AND JUST AS A SMALL STORY, AS MANY OF
19:24:26  YOU HAVE HEARD, THIS PANDEMIC HAS REALLY
19:24:30  SHOWN THE PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN
19:24:33  A SMALL BUSINESS LIKE MINE, LIKE THE FAMILY-OWNED BUSINESS,
19:24:36  MY DAD HAS OWNED PHARMACIES IN
FREMONT FOR OVER 40
19:24:39  YEARS, BUT THIS PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE CITY, FREMONT FIRE
19:24:43 , PD, LARGE AND SMALL BUSINESSES
19:24:46 , A SMALL  FAMILY-OWNED BUSINESS WAS ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH SO
19:24:50  MUCH DOING  TESTING,
PPE, VACCINATIONS, SO
19:24:53  THAT WE HAVE AN 89% VACCINATION RATE.
THAT'S UNHEARD
19:24:57  OF FOR A CITY LIKE OURS.
THAT REALLY DOES
19:25:00  SUPPORT THAT LOCAL -- THE SMALL
19:25:03  VERSUS LARGE COOPERATION.
AND
19:25:06  I'M GOING TO SAY THIS, YOU KNOW,
19:25:11  I TOOK OVER THE FAMILY BUSINESS OVER THE LAST FEW  YEARS.

19:25:14 BEING A MEMBER OF THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE, IT'S SO IMPORTANT, AND THE CONNECTING
19:25:17  OF THE SMALL BUSINESS WITH THE LARGER BUSINESS TO
19:25:21  REALLY CONNECT EVERYBODY TO MAKE OUR CITY A  BETTER
19:25:24  PLACE FOR THE
BETTERMENT OF THE COMMUNITY.
I REALLY DO
19:25:28  THINK, YOU KNOW, CINDY AND OUR TEAM HERE AT THE FREMONT
19:25:31  CHAMBER IS REALLY A LEADER IN ALL OF CALIFORNIA.
AND I THINK WE SHOULD
19:25:34  RECOGNIZE THAT WHAT WE DO IN A CITY THE SIZE OF
19:25:37  OURS WITH A CHAMBER THAT BRINGS THE AMAZON
19:25:41 S, THE HYDES
19:25:44 , THE BIG CORPORATIONS ALONG WITH US GUYS,
19:25:48  THE HALLERS, THAT'S A TESTAMENT
TO
19:25:51  THE FREMONT CHAMBER OF COMMERCE.
SO THANK YOU SO MUCH, I REALLY
19:25:54  APPRECIATE WHAT THE CHAMBER IS DOING, THANK YOU FOR DOING THIS.
MY
19:25:57  STAFF IS GOING TO BE SO EXCITED BECAUSE THEY LOVE THE FACT THAT IT
19:26:01  GETS RECOGNIZED IN THE CITY.
SO THANK YOU.

19:26:04 >> Mayor Mei: IT'S OUR PLEASURE, AND THAT'S WHY I HAVE TO THANK ALSO
19:26:08  OUR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT TEAM AND OUR CITY STAFF
19:26:11  ACROSS THE BOARD ON SO MANY DIFFERENT EFFORTS, WHETHER IT'S
19:26:14  WITH THE PERMITTING
PROCESSES THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO
19:26:18  FACILITATE AND ALSO WITH THE ASSISTANCE IN TERMS
19:26:21  OF SMALL BUSINESS GRANTS AND OTHER THINGS THAT WE'VE PROVIDED.

19:26:24 I'M VERY PROUD OF THE PARTNERSHIP AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR
19:26:27  US TO TRY TO SAVE AS MANY SMALL BUSINESSES AND TO HELP
19:26:30  CONNECT THOSE SERVICES TO OUR COMMUNITY AS THEY REALLY CREATE
19:26:33  THE NEIGHBORHOODS
THAT MAKE OUR FAMILIES AND OUR
19:26:36  COMMUNITY SPECIAL.
SO THANK YOU FOR JOINING US THIS EVENING.

19:26:41 AND WE'LL SEE YOU SHOPPING AROUND, I'M SURE.

19:26:48 THANK YOU.
NEXT I'M GOING TO RETURN TO THE ITEMS ON THE CONSENT CALENDAR
19:26:51  THAT WERE -- IS IT PUBLIC COMMENT FIRST?
>> Ms. Gauthier:
19:26:54  WE HAVE PUBLIC COMMENT
19:26:57  FIRST.
>> Mayor Mei: SO LET'S SEE.
PUBLIC COMMENT FIRST.

19:27:05 >> Ms. Gauthier: I SEE NO HANDS RAISED -- SO
19:27:08  RE,  MR. BEEKMAN JUST RAISED HIS HAND
19:27:11  HAND, AS DID CHRIS.
>> Mayor Mei: IS THIS FOR PUBLIC
19:27:15  COMMENT?
THEY PULLED THE AGENDA ITEMS SO I JUST WANTED TO CHECK
19:27:18  WHICH ONE ARE THEY UNDER,
19:27:21  I GUESS PUBLIC COMMENT?
>> Ms. Gauthier: MR. BEEKMAN, ARE YOU SPEAKING
19:27:24 ING UNDER PUBLIC COMMENT
19:27:28  OR CONSENT CALENDAR  ITEM?
>> I HAVE A COMMENT.
>> Ms. Gauthier:
19:27:31  OKAY.

19:27:37 >> Mayor Mei: PLEASE BEGIN.
>> THANK YOU.
HI
19:27:40 .
I SPOKE A LOT AT PUBLIC COMMENT TIME
19:27:43  AT THE NOVEMBER 2ND, 2021 FREMONT CITY COUNCIL MEETING
19:27:47 .
THANK YOU FOR
19:27:50  YOUR TIME AND PATIENCE WITH MYSELF.
I'M NOT FULLY SURE BUT IN
19:27:54  SOME SIMPLE STATISTIC READING
19:27:57  OF ENERGY PLANS OF THE NEXT DECADE, I CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THERE MAY BE
19:28:00  A LARGE EARTHQUAKE IN THE SFA AREA
19:28:03  IN 2023.
THIS WOULD MEAN PLANNING IDEAS FOR
19:28:06  2022 MAY BE MUCH DIFFERENT THAN THE
19:28:10  2023, 24 AND 25 ONWARD.
IN NO WAY DO I MEAN
19:28:14  THESE WARDS AS ALARMIST OR THESE IDEAS TO BE USED FOR POLITICAL REASON
19:28:17 S OR DISASTER CAPITALISM PRACTICES
19:28:20 .
I'M NOT FULLY SURE WHAT MAY HAPPEN IN THE YEAR
19:28:24  2023.
IT'S MY HOPE IN OFFERING THESE CONCERNS, IT CAN MAKE
19:28:27  SOMETHING CLEAR FOR YOURSELVES AND WHAT TO BETTER
19:28:30  EXPECT IN 2023, AND FROM THIS, I FEEL THIS CAN HELP WITH BETTER
19:28:33  PLANNING DECISIONS FOR YOURSELVES
IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS AS WELL
19:28:36 .
I HOPE I CAN HAVE SOME LETTER WRITING CONVERSATIONS WITH
19:28:40  FREMONT CITY GOVERNMENT THAT CAN HELP TOWARDS IDEAS OF CLARITY
19:28:43  AND MORE MATURE WAYS TO TALK ABOUT EMERGENCY COMMUNITY
19:28:46  PLANNING AND HEALTH AND
HUMAN SERVICES.
A FINAL REMIND
19:28:49 ER IN ALREADY GOOD PLANNING AND PREPARATION WORK, F
19:28:53  FPD AND MOST POLICE DEPARTMENTS OF THE BAY AREA CITIES HAVE
19:28:56  ALREADY RECEIVED
19:29:00  IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE PREPARATION WORK OF F
19:29:03 PD AND MOST
POLICE DEPARTMENTS OF THE BAY AREA
19:29:06 .
THEY HAVE ALREADY MUCH RECEIVE
19:29:10 ED INFRASTRUCTURE BUDGET MONEY IN THE PAST
19:29:13  FEW YEARS.
FROM THIS, OAKLAND AND SAN JOSÉ BEGAN A NEW STANDARD THIS
19:29:16  PAST SUMMER THAT WE CAN BEGIN TO  BETTER CONSIDER IDEAS OF
19:29:20  HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES IDEAS, REIMAGINE, AND EQUITY, AS
19:29:23  HOW TO BEGIN TO BETTER
 ADDRESS THE NEXT FEW YEARS AND
19:29:26  THIS DECADE OF COMMUNITY PUBLIC SAFETY.

19:29:29 THANKS A LOT AGAIN FOR YOUR PATIENCE WITH MYSELF
19:29:33  AT PUBLIC COMMENT TIME, AND JUST LEARNING HOW TO PRESENT
19:29:36  INFORMATIONAL HELPFUL WAY TO DESCRIBE
19:29:39  PUBLIC COMMENT ISSUES.
THANK YOU.

19:29:45 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
NEXT SPEAKER IS CHRIS.
WELCOME.

19:29:50 >> THANK YOU.
SO,
19:29:53  I DIDN'T PULL IT OFF THE CONSENT CALENDAR
19:29:57  BUT THERE WAS A REASON FOR THAT.
SO YOU INSTALLED
19:30:00  NEW VICE MAYOR, CONGRATULATIONS.
BUT
19:30:05  IN THE
19:30:09  STAFF REPORT, YOU NOTE
19:30:13  THAT THIS IS PER THE CITY COUNCIL HANDBOOK OF RULES
19:30:16  AND PROCEDURES.
THERE IS
19:30:19  NO PLACE YOU CAN FIND THAT ON THE FREMONT.GOV WEBSITE
19:30:22 .
I'VE TRIED TO USE SEARCH
19:30:26  ENGINES TO FIND IT, I KNOW THAT IT WAS AMENDED RECENTLY
19:30:31 , BUT CONTINUALLY
19:30:34  FOR TRANSPARENCY, NOTHING IS AVAILABLE THROUGH THE WEBSITE
19:30:39  WITHOUT ACTUALLY CONTACTING ONE -- SOMEONE
AT
19:30:43  THE CITY.
THIS IS NOT TRANSPARENCY
19:30:46 .
THANK YOU.

19:30:51 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
AND NEXT FOR THE AGENDA ITEMS
19:30:54  THAT WERE PULLED FOR THE
19:30:57  CONSENT CALENDAR, WE HAVE FIRST ITEM
19:31:00  2C AS IN CAT, AND THAT IS REGARDING SOLID
19:31:04  WASTE, AND I BELIEVE THAT WAS PULLED BY CHRIS ALSO.

19:31:13 PLEASE PROCEED.
>> YES, IT WAS.

19:31:17 I THINK THE CITY MISSED AN OPPORTUNITY HERE
19:31:20  TO IMPROVE PUBLIC WASTE
19:31:23  FOR THE PROBLEM WE HAVE WITH HOMELESS PEOPLE
19:31:26  AND PEOPLE WITH VEHICLES ON THE STREET AND
19:31:29  THE TRASH THAT CREATES IT.
NOWHERE IN THIS
19:31:33  POLICY DOES IT SEEM TO -- IT
19:31:36  ONLY SEEMS TO CRIMINALIZE IT, IT DOESN'T SEEM TO ACTUALLY PUT
19:31:39  FORWARD A PLAN TO HELP WITH ANY OF THAT
19:31:43  WE HAVE IN OUR CITY TODAY.
AND SO I THINK YOU'RE REALLY MISSING
19:31:47  AN OPPORTUNITY HERE INSTEAD OF JUST TAKING
19:31:50  THE DRAFT PLAN FROM THE COUNTY THAT EVERYONE AGREED
19:31:53  ON, BUT TO FOCUS THIS FOR FREMONT
19:31:56  AND WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO
19:32:00  BY
BALANCING THE PROBLEM WITH
19:32:03  HOMELESSNESS, PEOPLE ON THE STREET AND THE TRASH
19:32:06  THAT EVERYONE ELSE HAS TO SEE AND DEAL WITH.
THANK YOU.

19:32:16 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS.
CAN I GET ANY QUESTIONS,
19:32:19  COMMENTS OR A MOTION BY THE COUNCIL?
>> Councilmember Cox: SO MOVE
19:32:23 .

19:32:26  COX AND SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER
19:32:29  SHAO.

COUNCILMEMBER KENG, AYE.

MAYOR MEI,
19:32:49  AYE.
SO THE MOTION FOR ITEM 2C
19:32:52  AS IN CAT PASSES UNANIMOUSLY
19:32:55 .
NEXT IS ITEM 2D, AND THAT WAS REGARD
19:32:59 ING --
>> Ms. Gauthier: 2E.

19:33:03 >> Mayor Mei: 2E, SORRY, BECAUSE D WAS THE OTHER MOTION.

19:33:06 2E, WHICH IS FOR THE SOFTWARE PURCHASE
19:33:09 .
>> Ms. Gauthier: RIGHT.
CHRIS AND BLAIR BOTH RAISED THEIR 
19:33:12 HANDS FOR THIS ITEM.
>> Mayor Mei: YES.
AND THAT WAS THE PURCHASE OF
19:33:15  REPLACEMENT SOFTWARE FOR THE POLICE DEPARTMENT'S
19:33:19  COMPUTER-AIDED -- CAD.
YES.

19:33:24 SO WE CALL CHRIS,
19:33:27  OR BLAIR?
>> BLAIR IS HERE.

19:33:29 HELLO.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
PLEASE PROCEED.

19:33:33 >> THANK YOU.

19:33:37 YEAH.
FOR THIS ITEM, I WISH I COULD GO
19:33:40  INTO GREATER DETAIL.
YOU'RE GETTING A
19:33:43  NEW CAD SYSTEM, IT SOUNDS LIKE, OR IMPROVING
19:33:46  UPON IT.

19:33:50 THAT'S A MAJOR OPERATION, AND IT'S A MAJOR SERVICE
19:33:53  AND FUNCTION OF A POLICE DEPARTMENT
19:33:56  AND CAD SYSTEM.
$2MILLION I THINK I
19:34:00  SAID, SO I JUST KIND OF WANTED TO NOTE IT AT THIS
19:34:04  TIME OPENLY AND  PUBLICLY,
19:34:07  AND A REMINDER OF THE IMPORTANCE OF GOOD OPEN
19:34:11  ACCOUNTABLE TECHNOLOGY AND DATA COLLECTION
19:34:14 
PRACTICES CAN
19:34:17  REALLY HELP CONSIDER WHAT CAN BE
19:34:20  OUR MORE POSITIVE SUSTAINABLE FUTURE.
I MEAN, WE
19:34:24  CAN STILL BUILD IDEAS OF HOPE, I THINK, AND WE'RE
19:34:27  TRYING TO FIND THOSE IDEAS OF HOPE, AND I THINK
19:34:30  IT'S GOOD PRACTICES OF
19:34:33  SHARING OPENNESS WITH OUR DATA COLLECTION
19:34:37  THAT IS KIND OF KEY TO OUR
SURVIVAL
19:34:41  IN A WAY.
IT'S THE IDEAS OF RESPONSIBILITY
19:34:44  AND BETTER DEMOCRATIC PRACTICES,
19:34:47  AND
19:34:51  WE'VE CREATED KIND OF A STRANGE WORLD, AND I THINK TO HAVE A SENSE
19:34:54  OF GOOD OPEN DEMOCRATIC PRACTICES, CAN REALLY BE
19:34:57  HELPFUL TO
OURSELVES IN HOW TO
19:35:00  -- THINGS ARE ACTUALLY  DECENT.
AND CAN WORK
19:35:03  WELL.
SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.

19:35:10 
>> Ms. Gauthier: CHRIS WAS THE OTHER
19:35:13  HAND RAISED AT THE  BEGINNING OF THE MEETING.

19:35:27 >> SO I JUST WANTED TO BRING THE CITY TO THE ATTENTION THAT THE CALIFORNIA
19:35:31  PUBLISHED RECORD ACT ALLOWS ACCESS FOR PEOPLE TO COME
19:35:34  AND INSPECT RECORDS, NOT ONLY MAKE
19:35:37  RECORDS REQUESTS.
AND
19:35:42  I STRONGLY CAUTION THEM TO MAKE SURE
19:35:45  WHATEVER SYSTEM THEY DECIDE TO BRING FORWARD AND IMPLEMENT
19:35:49 , THAT THEY DO IT IN A WAY WHERE CITIZENS
19:35:52  CAN SHOW UP AND VIEW THE RECORDS AS
19:35:55  IT SAYS
19:35:59  YOU CAN IN THE
PUBLIC RECORDS ACT.
THE INTENTIONAL STORE
19:36:02 ING OF  NON-PUBLIC WITH
19:36:05  PUBLIC RECORDS OR NOT LABELING THE
19:36:08  DATA APPROPRIATELY IS
19:36:12  GOING TO COST THE CITY MONEY IN THE FUTURE
19:36:15 .
IF THE RECORDS ARE PUBLIC AND
19:36:19  IT ALWAYS TAKES CITY STAFF
19:36:22  SOME TIME TO DEAL WITH THEM TO SHOW THEM TO THE PUBLIC,
19:36:25  THEN THAT COSTS MONEY EVERY TIME SOMEONE MAKES A
19:36:29  REQUEST.
BUT IF YOU WANT TO BE OPEN AND
19:36:32  YOU WANT TO ACTUALLY
19:36:36  DO WHAT THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT
19:36:39  HAS REQUESTED OF YOU AND COURT CASES HAVE SAID, YOU
19:36:42  NEED TO MAKE IT EASILY OPEN TO PEOPLE.

19:36:46 IF SOMEONE WANTS TO COME AND VIEW SOMETHING, IT SHOULDN'T REQUIRE REDACT
19:36:50 ING OF THE DATA.

19:36:53 YOU SHOULD HAVE A VIEW AVAILABLE BY LABELING THE DATA WHEN
19:36:56  IT IS INPUT.
THIS
19:37:00  IS BASIC FOR BIG BUSINESSES WHERE THEY
19:37:03  HAVE REGULATORY OBLIGATIONS WITH
19:37:06  DATA.
AND THE CITY
19:37:10  SEEMS TO THINK THAT WE CAN JUST TELL PEOPLE THEY CAN'T COME
19:37:13  IN AND SEE IT.
I HAVE BEEN DENIED MORE THAN
19:37:16  FOUR TIMES PHYSICALLY TO SEE DATA SAYING
19:37:19 , OH, WE DON'T HAVE IT.

19:37:23 AND I'VE TALKED TO YOUR LEGAL DEPARTMENT, AND THE ISSUE IS BECAUSE THEY DON'T
19:37:26  KNOW HOW TO REDACT THE DATA THAT IS ACTUALLY
19:37:31  LEGALLY ABLE BY LAW TO BE  REDACTED VERSUS
19:37:35  THE MAJORITY OF IT, WHICH IS
PUBLIC.

19:37:39 SO WHEN YOU IMPLEMENT THIS NEW SYSTEM, SHOULD YOU NOT DO THIS,
19:37:43  YOU ARE OPENING YOURSELVES TO COST AND LAWSUITS
19:37:46 .
THANK YOU.

19:38:06 >> Ms. Gauthier: MAYOR, YOU'RE MUTED.
>> Mayor Mei: I'D LIKE TO SEE IF THERE'S A
19:38:10  MOTION TO MOVE FORWARD WITH 2E AND I'D LIKE TO NOTE THAT THIS IS
19:38:13  FOR THE SOFTWARE AND ALSO A 10-YEAR MAINTENANCE AGREEMENT
19:38:16 .
>> Councilmember Cox: SO  MOVED.
>> Councilmember Jones: SO MOVED.

19:38:18 >> Mayor Mei: MOTION BY COUNCILMEMBER JONES AND SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER COX.

19:38:22 I'M JUST GOING LEFT TO RIGHT ON MY SCREEN.

19:38:26 SINCE IT WAS ECHO.
MAY I HAVE A ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE
19:38:28 .
>> Ms. Gauthier: COUNCILMEMBER COX, AYE.

19:38:32 COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN, AYE.
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN
19:38:35 , AYE.
COUNCILMEMBER JONES, AYE.

19:38:39 COUNCILMEMBER KENG, AYE.
VICE MAYOR SHAO
19:38:42 , AYE.
MAYOR MEI, AYE
19:38:45 .
THE MOTION PASSES FOR
19:38:48  ITEM 2E AS IN ELEPHANT.
NEXT IS
19:38:52  ITEM 2F, AND THAT
19:38:55  IS, I BELIEVE, BLAIR HAD WANTED TO SPEAK ON THIS ITEM.

19:38:59 >> Ms. Gauthier: RIGHT.
>> Mayor Mei: AND I  APOLOGIZE --
19:39:05 
>> HI.
>> Mayor Mei: THAT'S FOR  AB361.

19:39:08 >> YEAH.
THANK YOU.

19:39:12 I'VE BEEN TRYING TO PRACTICE A SPEECH AS
19:39:15  THIS ITEM IS KIND OF GOING TO DIFFERENT CITY COUNCILS
19:39:18  ACROSS THE BAY AREA AT THIS  TIME, AND SAN JOSÉ
19:39:21 , SANTA CLARA COUNTY, GOVERNMENT
19:39:25  OF BERKELEY AND
OAKLAND, IT SPELLS
19:39:28  OUT A CONTINUATION OF THE HYBRID SYSTEM,
19:39:31  AND HOW WE CAN SCHEDULE OUR LIVES AROUND COVID
19:39:35  ISSUES.
AND IF IT'S OKAY
19:39:38 , I HAVE A FEW WORDS THAT I'VE BEEN PRACTICING
19:39:41  ABOUT HOW WE SCHEDULE OUR LIVES IN CONSIDERING
19:39:45  COVID AT THIS TIME, AND FOR THIS FALL AND WINTER
19:39:48 .
COVID RATES ARE GOING UP
19:39:52  IN ENGLAND AND IN EUROPE AT THIS TIME
19:39:56 , AND IT'S A WORRISOME  THING,
19:39:59  AND THAT USUALLY MEANS IT WILL BE ARRIVING HERE AGAIN
19:40:03  SOMETIME SOON, COVID,
19:40:06  SO MASK USE IS REALLY
IMPORTANT
19:40:09  FOR OURSELVES TO CONTINUE MASK USE AND TO CONTINUE THROUGH THE HOLIDAYS, WITH
19:40:12  HOLIDAYS COMING UP.

19:40:16 I ALSO WANTED TO REMIND THAT AS WE'RE CONSIDER
19:40:19 ING THE VACCINATION PROCESS FOR YOUNG PEOPLE AT THIS TIME
19:40:22  IN CALIFORNIA,
19:40:25  I HOPE WE CAN LEARN GOOD PRACTICES OF WHAT CAN
19:40:28  BE, I DON'T KNOW, JUST HOW TO
SHARE WHAT IS
19:40:32  GOOD ABOUT THE VACCINE PROCESS.
I KNOW WE'VE GONE THROUGH A
19:40:35  LOT OF THIS BEFORE, THIS PAST SUMMER, BUT I
19:40:38  THINK -- I HOPE WE CAN CONTINUE THOSE PRACTICES
19:40:41  OF WHAT CAN BE OPEN ABOUT LEARN
19:40:44 ING ABOUT WHAT THE VACCINE PROCESS IS ABOUT.

19:40:48 AND IT TAKES WORK AND EFFORT TO MAKE THOSE STEPS
19:40:51  HOW TO LEARN TO BE MORE OPEN ABOUT THE SUBJECT MATTER
19:40:55 .
IT
19:40:58  CAN BE REWARDING, I THINK, BECAUSE THERE IS NEEDS FOR THE VACCINE
19:41:01  AND I THINK WE'RE FINDING OUT THERE'S WAYS THAT
19:41:05  IF WE WORK HARD, PEOPLE NECESSARILY MAY
19:41:09  NOT HAVE TO TAKE THE  VACCINE.
I THANK THE WORD
19:41:12  WORK OF ALAMEDA COUNCIL
19:41:15  COUNTY THAT AREN'T FORCING THEIR WORKERS TO TAKE THE VACCINE
19:41:18  IF THEY HAVE
19:41:24  WEEKLY TESTS.
SANTA CLARA COUNTY IS OFFERING MANDATES FOR THEIR
19:41:27  COUNTY AND CITY EMPLOYEE WORKERS IN
19:41:30  SAN JOSÉ, SO
19:41:34  I'M MORE OF THE IDEA OF FLEXIBILITY.
AND I HOPE WE CAN
19:41:37  LEARN HOW TO BET
19:41:40 TER TALK ABOUT THOSE IDEALS AND IDEAS THIS FALL AND WINTER.
WE NEED
19:41:43  TO CONTINUE THOSE WORK AND EFFORT.
IT TAKES WORK AND EFFORT.

19:41:46 AND I'VE BEEN WORKING OF COURSE, YOU KNOW, ON OPEN
19:41:50  PUBLIC  POLICIES WITH TECHNOLOGY IDEAS THAT I THINK CAN REALLY,
19:41:53  REALLY HELP CREATE A NOW
19:41:56  NEUTRAL SPACE FOR REAL GOOD DIALOGUE FOR ALL
SIDES
19:41:59  TO ASK QUESTIONS, WHAT IS OUR FUTURE OF TECHNOLOGY
19:42:03  AND DATA COLLECTION WITH THE VACCINE
19:42:06  PROCESS?
THANK YOU.

19:42:09 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
I SEE ANOTHER RAISED HAND FOR THIS ITEM.

19:42:12 THAT'S CHRIS.
IF YOU'D LIKE TO UNMUTE  YOURSELF,
19:42:15  PLEASE.
THANK YOU.
>> THANK YOU
19:42:19 .
SO PRIOR TO
19:42:22  HAVING ONLINE PUBLIC MEETINGS
19:42:26 , SOMEONE WAS ABLE TO COME FORWARD AND GIVE A PRESENTATION
19:42:29  WHERE THEY WERE ABLE TO USE
19:42:32  HARD COPIES TO SHOW THE
19:42:36  CITY COUNCIL INFORMATION.
AND THE
19:42:39  CITY COUNCIL IN
19:42:42  VIRTUAL MEETINGS HAS DONE NOTHING TO PUT THAT BACK IN PLACE.
UNTIL YOU PUT
19:42:45  THAT BACK IN  PLACE, I THINK YOU REALLY NEED TO
19:42:49  CONSIDER WHETHER OR NOT YOU ACTUALLY MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF
19:42:52  THIS.
WHAT
19:42:55  I WOULD LIKE IS FOR YOU TO PUT IT IN PLACE FOR A WAY
19:42:58  THAT PEOPLE COULD DO THEIR 3 MINUTE PRESENTATIONS.
WHETHER IT BE POWERPOINT
19:43:03  OR VIDEO
19:43:06  OF THEIR FACE SHOWING AND HOLDING UP STUFF
19:43:09 , BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THEY USED TO BE ABLE TO DO.
SO
19:43:12  UNTIL YOU DO THAT, YOU ARE STILL, YOU KNOW, RESTRICTING
19:43:17  PEOPLE'S RIGHTS UNDER THE BROWN ACT
19:43:20 .
AND WHEN I LOOK THROUGH ALL OF
19:43:23  WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO TO MAKE
19:43:27  THIS CORRECT, I THINK YOU NEED TO CONSIDER
19:43:30  THE TRANSMISSION RATES AND THE FACT
19:43:34  THAT THIS WOULD SEEM TO SUGGEST WE SHOULDN'T HAVE
19:43:37  KIDS IN
SCHOOL.
IF WE CAN'T HAVE A PUBLIC
19:43:40  MEETING, THEN HOW
19:43:43  CAN KIDS BE REQUIRED TO GO TO CLASS?

19:43:47 YOU SEEM TO SUGGEST
19:43:51  THAT
19:43:54  -- THAT YOU SOMEHOW ARE ABOVE
19:43:58  TEACHERS
19:44:02  AND THE RISK THEY NEED TO TAKE.
NOW TO BE CLEAR,
19:44:05  MY RECOMMENDATION IS THAT YOU CREATE
19:44:08  A WAY THAT PEOPLE CAN GIVE PRESENTATIONS
19:44:11  DURING MEETINGS.
WHETHER IT'S PRE-SUBMITTAL
19:44:15  SO THAT THEY'RE BEING BROUGHT UP, OR IF
19:44:18  YOU'RE ABLE/WILLING
19:44:21  TO GIVE THE MEETING OVER TO SOMEONE SO THEY CAN GIVE A PRESENTATION WHERE THEY
19:44:24  CAN SHOW CHARTS OR GRAPHS.
BUT I REALLY
19:44:27  FEEL THIS IS
19:44:31   LESSENING THE IMPACT THAT CITIZENS HAVE ON THE COUNCIL.

19:44:34 AND, THEREFORE, A VIOLATION OF THE
19:44:37  BROWN ACT UNTIL YOU RESOLVE THAT.
THANK YOU
19:44:40 .
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
AS NOT
19:44:43 ED IN THE BEGINNING, I WANTED TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE KNEW THAT IF
19:44:46  YOU ARE TO EMAIL US, THAT IS ADDED TO OUR AGENDA
19:44:50   ITEMS AND THAT WOULD INCLUDE YOUR ATTACHMENTS,
19:44:53  WHICH WE'VE HAD SOME PEOPLE
SUBMIT TO US, AND THOSE ARE CONSIDERED AS PART
19:44:56  OF OUR PUBLIC RECORD.

19:45:01 ARE THERE COMMENTS FROM THE COUNCIL ON THIS ITEM?
MAY
19:45:04  I GET A MOTION?
>> Councilmember Jones: SO
19:45:07  MOVED.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
THIS IS AGAIN FOR ITEM
19:45:12  2F.
>> Councilmember Cox: SECOND.
>> Mayor Mei: MOVED
19:45:15  BY COUNCILMEMBER JONES AND SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER COX.
ROLL CALL, PLEASE
19:45:18 .
>> Ms. Gauthier:
19:45:22  COUNCILMEMBER COX, AYE.
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN
19:45:25 , AYE.
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, AYE.
COUNCILMEMBER JONES
19:45:28 , AYE.
COUNCILMEMBER KENG, AYE.

19:45:31 VICE MAYOR SHAO, AYE.

19:45:38 >> Mayor Mei: SO THE MOTION PASSES EU NAN MUSTILY.

19:45:41  UNANIMOUSLY
19:45:45 .
NEXT IS ITEM 2G.
I
19:45:48  BELIEVE SHARON SCHARFF WANTED TO SPEAK ON THIS AGENDA ITEM.
>> Ms.
19:45:51  Gauthier: CORRECT, MAYOR.

19:45:55 >> Mayor Mei: THIS IS FOR THE PAVEMENT CONTRACTS.
>> Ms. Gauthier: SHARON,
19:45:58  IF YOU'D PLEASE UNMUTE YOURSELF?
>> HI.
MAY I ASK A
19:46:01  QUESTION BEFORE I START?

19:46:04 >> Mayor Mei: SURE.
>> EVEN THOUGH THIS IS A
19:46:07  REMOVAL FROM CONSENT CALENDAR
19:46:11 , THIS IS STILL BASICALLY A 3-MINUTE MONOLOGUE?

19:46:16 >> Mayor Mei: IT'S A  3 MINUTE --
>> Ms. Gauthier: YES, YOU HAVE THREE MINUTES
19:46:19 .
>> IS THERE ANY BACK AND FORTH OR NOT?

19:46:22 >> Mayor Mei: NO.
I
19:46:26  WOULD HAVE TO REFER TO OUR COUNSEL BUT THERE'S NO
19:46:29  --
>> OKAY.
WELL, I'VE REQUESTED THE REMOVAL
19:46:32  OF THIS ITEM TO ADDRESS CONCERNS REGARDING THE APPROVAL
19:46:35  OF MAINTENANCE PROJECTS FOR SPECIFIC
19:46:39  MAINTENANCE ITEMS NO LONGER BEING EXECUTED IN A TRANSPARENT OR
19:46:42  ACCEPTABLE
 MANNER.

19:46:45 2018, PWC
19:46:49  8195P WAS APPROVED UNDER A VERY SPECIFIC STREET MAINTENANCE
19:46:52  PROJECT, WHICH IN THE 30 YEARS I'VE LIVED HERE, MEANT EXACTLY
19:46:56  THAT, REPAIRING OR RESEALING THE STREET.
SIGNS
19:46:59  WERE POSTED WHEN CONSTRUCTION STARTED, ONLY INDICATING
19:47:02  THE APPROVED MAINTENANCE PLAN WOULD BE PERFORMED.

19:47:06 AN ESTABLISHED STREET WITH ZERO FATALITIES AND
19:47:09  THREE MINOR COLLISIONS SINCE ITS CREATION IN
19:47:12  1972, IN A HISTORIC AREA OF OUR CITY
19:47:16 , LET ME REPEAT THAT,
19:47:19  RANCHO ARROYO HAD ZERO FATALITIES AND
19:47:22 
THREE MINOR COLLISIONS SINCE 1972.

19:47:26 INSTEAD, WITHOUT PUBLIC HEARING OR EVEN PUBLIC NOTICE
19:47:29 , THE WORK PERFORMED FAR EXCEEDED STREET
19:47:32  MAINTENANCE.
THE PROJECT THAT HAD BEEN APPROVED
19:47:36  BY COUNCIL, A SIMPLE CEQA EXEMPT
19:47:39  MAINTENANCE PROJECT TURNED INTO A RESTRUCTURING OF A ONCE UNIQUE AND PROTECTED
19:47:43  ISOLATED AREA.
PUBLIC WORKS CREATED STREET PARKING
19:47:46 , REMOVED A LOADING ZONE, ADDED BUFFER
19:47:49  LANES, REDUCED ACCESS, RESTRICTED
19:47:53  RIGHT AND LEFT TURNING AND VISIBILITY, ALL TO THE DETRIMENT OF THE SAFETY
19:47:56  AND CHARACTER OF
RANCHO ARROYO.
THESE CHANGES WERE IN
19:47:59  DIRECT VIOLATION OF THE ORIGINAL PUD
19:48:04  722, CITY ORDINANCE 847, CITY ORDINANCE
19:48:08  1114, 1986 CITY COUNCIL
19:48:11  RESOLUTION 660, WHICH RATIFIED NO
19:48:14  PARKING AND ADDED A LOADING ZONE FOR
SAFETY.

19:48:20 THIS HAS SET A DANGEROUS PRECEDENT FOR OUR NEIGHBORHOODS
19:48:23  AND RESIDENCES.
I'M REQUESTING THE CITY COUNCIL TO CLARIFY
19:48:26  WITH THE CITY MANAGER THE PROPER PROCEDURES WHEN CHANGING THE SCOPE
19:48:29  OF A ROUTINE MAINTENANCE PROJECT CURRENTLY
19:48:32  PUSHED THROUGH AS A CONSENT CALENDAR ITEM.
THERE
19:48:35  REALLY IS NO EXCUSE THAT THE ACTUAL SCOPE OF THE
19:48:40  MAINTENANCE PROJECT SHOULD NOT BE MADE PUBLIC PRIOR TO
19:48:43  PERFORMANCE.
THERE ARE PROCEDURAL
19:48:46  REQUIREMENTS IN PLACE, AND THEY ARE NOT AUTOMATICALLY
19:48:50  EXEMPT FROM CEQA OR STUDY.
THE
19:48:53  PUBLIC NEEDS TO BE MADE AWARE OF THIS EXTRAORDINARY DISREGARD FOR THE
19:48:56  SYSTEM CURRENTLY IN PLACE AND THE ACTUAL SCOPE OF THE WORK TO BE
19:49:00  DONE MADE PUBLIC, AGAIN, PRIOR TO THE
19:49:03  WORK BEING DONE.
AND I WILL BE HAPPY
19:49:06  TO DELIVER TO YOU ALL MY BACK
19:49:08 UP.
THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:49:14 MAY I GET ANY QUESTIONS, COMMENTS?
I SEE COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN
19:49:17 , YOU HAVE YOUR HAND RAISED.

19:49:21 >> YES, THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR.
YES, I WAS WONDER
19:49:24 ING, THESE SPECIFIC PROJECTS, ARE
19:49:28  THEY FOR SPECIFIC STREETS OR IS IT JUST GENERAL WHEREVER NEEDED
19:49:31 ?
IF IT'S SPECIFIC STREETS, IS THERE A WAY YOU
19:49:34  COULD SHARE THOSE PROJECTS WITH US?

19:49:37 OR SEND US AN EMAIL?
FLEESH
19:49:40 ?

19:49:44 >> Mayor Mei: HI, HANS.
>> COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN
19:49:47 , THIS IS HANS LARSEN, PUBLIC WORKS DIRECTOR.
SO THE
19:49:50  WORK THAT'S THE SUBJECT OF THIS
19:49:53  ITEM IS A BASIC MAINTENANCE ACTIVITY WHERE
19:49:56  WE SEAL CRACKS ON THE ROAD
19:49:59 WAY, WHERE THEY EXIST.
AND THIS IS ESSENTIALLY
19:50:02  A PRECURSOR TO A SURFACE SEAL
19:50:06 ING TREATMENT THAT WILL HAPPEN IN THE FOLLOWING
19:50:09  YEAR.
TYPICALLY WE WILL
19:50:13  POST THOSE STREET ON OUR PAVEMENT
19:50:17  MAINTENANCE WEBSITE TO IDENTIFY WHERE THOSE ARE.
WE TYPICALLY DON'T DO THAT JUST
19:50:20  FOR THE CRACK SEALING ACTIVITY
19:50:23  SINCE IT ISN'T A MAJOR ITEM AND IT'S KIND OF OBVIOUS WHERE WE'RE
19:50:26  DOING THE WORK, IF THERE'S A BIG CRACK ON THE ROAD, WE
HAVE A CONTRACTOR
19:50:30  OUT THERE FILLING THOSE CRACKS.

19:50:33 IF I COULD JUST ADD SORT OF JUST FOLLOW
19:50:36 ING ON THE COMMENTS THAT WERE JUST MADE
19:50:39 , WE DO ACKNOWLEDGE BACK IN 2018, WE WERE A
19:50:43  BIT BOLD WITH SOME OF THE WORK THAT WE WERE DOING ON MODIFY
19:50:46 ING OUR STREETS TO
BE SAFE AND COMPLETE
19:50:49 .
THE WORK ON RANCHO
19:50:53  ARROYO PARKWAY WAS CONSISTENT WITH A GENERAL PLAN AMENDMENT
19:50:56  THAT MODIFIED THAT STREET FROM A FOUR-
19:50:59 LANE ROADWAY TO A TWO-LANE ROADWAY, SO WE TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY WITH
19:51:02  THE PAVEMENT
PROJECT TO MAKE THAT
19:51:06  MODIFICATION.
WE DID HEAR FROM THE
19:51:09  COMMUNITY THE CONCERNS.
WE DID HAVE TWO COMMUNITY MEETINGS ABOUT
19:51:12  THAT PROJECT AND IMPROVEMENTS ON NILES
19:51:16  BOULEVARD, AS WELL AS A COUPLE OF COMMUNITY
19:51:19  SURVEYS.
SO WE DID SORT OF APOLOGIZE
19:51:22  FOR THE SURPRISE EFFECT THAT  OCCURRED IN THAT CASE
19:51:25 , AND SINCE THEN, ANY PAVEMENT
19:51:29  MAINTENANCE PROJECT THAT INCLUDES ANY CHANGES
19:51:32  TO THE NUMBER OF LANES OR ANY CHANGES
IN PARKING
19:51:35 , IT'S BEEN OUR STANDARD PRACTICE TO
19:51:39  HAVE NOTIFICATION TO THE COMMUNITY ABOUT THOSE CHANGES, AND
19:51:42  THEN WE DO SPECIFIC
19:51:45 ALLY DISCLOSE THOSE CHANGES IN THE STAFF REPORT AS PART OF
19:51:48  THE PAVEMENT
MAINTENANCE CONTRACT.
SO THERE'VE BEEN
19:51:51  SOME CHANGES IN TERMS OF OUR OPERATIONS SINCE 2018.

19:51:54 SO I JUST THOUGHT I'D CLARIFY THAT FOR THE RECORD.
BE HAPPY
19:51:57  TO ANSWER ANY OTHER QUESTIONS.
THANK YOU.

19:52:03 >> Vice Mayor Salwan: THANK YOU, MR. LARSEN.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:52:06 SO ARE THERE ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM THE COUNCIL
19:52:10 ?
SEEING NONE
19:52:12 ?
>> Councilmember Jones: MAYOR MEI?
>> Mayor Mei: YES.

19:52:15 >> Councilmember Jones: AS THIS IS SIMPLY AN ITEM TO APPROVE A CONTRACT
19:52:18  WITH A COMPANY TO REPAIR CRACKS IN THE ROADWAY, I MOVE TO APPROVE
19:52:21 .
>> Mayor Mei: MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER JONES.

19:52:24 >> Councilmember Keng: I WILL SECOND THAT.
>> Mayor Mei: SECONDED BY 
19:52:27 COUNCILMEMBER KENG.
ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE.
>> Ms. Gauthier:
19:52:31  YES, MADAME MAYOR.
COUNCILMEMBER COX, AYE.
COUNCILMEMBER

19:52:41 COUNCILMEMBER KENG, AYE.
VICE MAYOR
19:52:45  SHAO, AYE.
MAYOR MEI, AYE
19:52:48 .
THE MOTION PASSES UNANIMOUSLY.
FOR
19:52:51  ITEM 2G AS IN GEORGE.

19:52:54 NEXT IS ITEM 2H AS IN
19:52:58  HARRY, I'M TRYING TO --
19:53:00 
>> Ms. Gauthier: KELLY RAISED HAND.
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY.

19:53:04 CAN WE PLEASE CALL HIM?

19:53:10 >> Ms. Gauthier: KELLY, 989?
PHONE NUMBER
19:53:14  989?
>> ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU.

19:53:17 THIS IS ABOUT A PR FIRM  CONTRACT, AND THIS PR
19:53:20  FIRM  OFFERS A LOT OF -- A WHOLE WIDE RANGE OF SERVICE
19:53:23 S.
IT'S A HIGH END,
19:53:26  HIGH-TECH, HIGH TOUCH PR FIRM.
AND
19:53:30  LAST I CHECKED, THE PLAY BOOK OF PR, PUBLIC RELATIONS, IT'S
19:53:34  SIMPLE.
TELL A STORY, MAKE IT RELEVANT, MAKE IT
19:53:37  INTERESTING, COMMUNICATE TO THE AUDIENCE,
19:53:40  RESPOND TO QUESTIONS, BUILD RELATIONSHIPS THAT ARE BASED
19:53:43  ON TRUST, AND DON'T LIE OR
19:53:46  MISREPRESENT THE FACTS OR REWRITE
THE
19:53:49  FACTS TO TWIST THE TRUTH.
OF COURSE THE CITY BROKE ALL
19:53:52  THOSE RULES LAST WEEK AT MISSION PEAK WHEN IT LIED LAST
19:53:55  WEEK ABOUT CLOSING THE PARK LAST  YEAR.

19:53:59 AND SO NOW WE'RE INTO CRISIS MANAGEMENT
19:54:02  WHEN YOU TELL THOSE KIND OF LIES AND YOU GET CAUGHT.
AND
19:54:05  CRISIS MANAGEMENT, THAT'S PRETTY SIMPLE TOO.
IF THE
19:54:08  CLIENT LIED ABOUT WRONGDOING, THEN THE PR AGENCY
19:54:12  SHOULD PROBABLY RESIGN THE ACCOUNT.
IF
19:54:15  THE INDIVIDUALS ACTED WITHOUT THE APPROVAL OF SENIOR MANAGEMENT, THEN
19:54:18  YOU JUST APPLY THOSE SAME PRINCIPLES AS FOR OTHER CRISIS
19:54:22 S, YOU USE HONEST, GOOD CARING INFORMATION, I'M JUST READING THIS OFF
19:54:25 
OF INTERNET PLAY BOOKS.
YOU ADMIT WE DON'T KNOW,
19:54:28  WE'RE SHOCKED, WE'RE SADDENED, WE'RE GOING TO TAKE APPROPRIATE ACTION
19:54:31  IMMEDIATELY.
YOU TAKE THOSE REMEDIAL CORRECTIVE ACTIONS
19:54:34  AS NECESSARY.
SO THE COUNCIL IS GOING TO NEED
19:54:37  A LOT MORE PR HELP, YOU KNOW, FROM REALLY SKILLED PR
19:54:41  PEOPLE, GET THE TOP LEVEL PEOPLE IN  HERE, I'M
19:54:44  SURE THEY'RE IN THAT FIRM, TO FIX THE LIES ABOUT MISSION
19:54:48  PEAK,
YOU KNOW, STOP THE BLEEDING BY
19:54:51  CORRECTING AND CLARIFYING, JUST CORRECT AND CLARIFY THAT FOR THE RECORD
19:54:54  AS THE PUBLIC WORKS DIRECTOR JUST SAID.
YOU KNOW.

19:54:57 JUST CLARIFY AND CORRECT THE RECORD AND ADMIT
19:55:01  WHAT REALLY HAPPENED, YOU KNOW, DON'T  MISMANAGE THE CITY
19:55:04  COMMUNICATIONS OUTREACH ANY MORE THAN YOU ALREADY HAVE,
19:55:07  AND STOP MISMANAGING THE CITY'S
REPUTATION
19:55:10 .
AND ALL OF THAT CAN BE DONE, BUT IT'S GOING TO
19:55:13  REQUIRE CONTINGENCY, MORE MONEY IN THIS CONTRACT.
BECAUSE IT'S ONLY
19:55:17  LESS THAN $200,000 A YEAR, AND THIS CITY HAS
19:55:20  DONE A LOT MORE DAMAGE THAN THAT.
JUST
19:55:23  IN THE LAST WEEK OR SO.
AND YOU'RE GOING TO NEED
19:55:26  A LOT MORE PR HELP AND YOU'VE GOT TO GET THOSE PEOPLE IN HERE AND HELP YOU
19:55:28  OUT.
YOU'RE BLEEDING.
STOP THE BLEEDING.

19:56:03 SEEING THAT THERE'S NO OTHER QUESTIONS, I WAS GOING TO JUST MAKE A
19:56:06  COMMENT REAL QUICKLY AND LET YOU KNOW THAT THE
19:56:10  HOFFMAN CONTRACT, I JUST WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW, THEY
19:56:13  WERE RECENTLY RECOGNIZED AS
AMONGST THE PR FIRMS FROM AROUND
19:56:16  THE GLOBE, AND NAMED GLOBAL TECH AGENCY
19:56:19  OF THE YEAR BY
19:56:22  PROVOKE MEDIA.
AND WE LEARNED ABOUT THIS AND THIS WAS SOMETHING THEY WERE
19:56:25  HONORED WITH AFTER THE STAFF REPORT.
BUT COULD I
19:56:29  HAVE ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS OR A MOTION FROM THE COUNCIL ON
19:56:32  ITEM --

19:56:48 COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN, AYE.
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, AYE
19:56:52 .
COUNCILMEMBER JONES, AYE.
COUNCILMEMBER KENG
19:56:55 , AYE.

19:56:59 VICE MAYOR SHAO, AYE.
MAYOR MEI,
19:57:02  AYE.

>> Mayor Mei: SO THE MOTION
19:57:05  PASSES FOR ITEM 2H AS IN HAM.
NEXT IS
19:57:09  ITEM 5A AS
19:57:12  IN APPLE, AND I BELIEVE THAT WAS PULLED,
19:57:16   AND --
>> Ms. Gauthier: BY COUNCILMEMBER COX.

19:57:19 >> Councilmember Cox: THAT'S CORRECT.
YES.
THANK YOU SO MUCH
19:57:23 .
I JUST WANTED
19:57:26  TO FIRST THANK THE RECREATION COMMISSION
19:57:29  FOR CONSIDERING ALL THE PROPOSED
19:57:32  QUOTES AND SELECTING THE ONE THAT
19:57:37  IS BEING QUOTED BY CORETTA SCOTT
19:57:40  KING, WHICH BASICALLY IS VERY SYMBOLIC OF
19:57:44  OUR
NEW INCLUSION DIVERSITY AND
19:57:47  EQUITY, BUT ALSO TO SERVE AS A
19:57:50  CENTER AND PART OF THE SOUL OF OUR
19:57:54  CITY OF FREMONT.
AND SO I WANTED TO THANK
19:57:58  THE RECREATION COMMISSION CHAIRED
19:58:01  BY JANNET PENCE AND ALL THE OTHER
19:58:04  COMMISSIONERS.
I REALLY THANK THEM FOR BEING SO THOUGHTFUL AND WORKING
19:58:08  WITH OUR CITY STAFF.
THANK YOU FOR THE CITY STAFF'S HARD
19:58:11  WORK AS WELL.

19:58:14 I WANTED TO PULL THIS BECAUSE IT'S A MOMENT OF
19:58:17  REVERENCE FOR ME PERSONALLY, BECAUSE I KNOW
19:58:21  CORETTA SCOTT KING WHEN SHE WAS ALIVE, I KNEW HER FAMILY
19:58:24 , AND SHE'S ALSO BESIDES
19:58:27  BEING AN INTERNATIONAL
AMERICAN
19:58:30  AUTHOR, ACTIVIST, CIVIL RIGHTS LEADER, AND THE
19:58:34  WIFE OF DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING, THAT I COULD
19:58:37  NOT JUST LET THIS JUST BE PASSED
19:58:41  AS A CONSENT AGENDA WITHOUT THE SIGNIFICANCE OF SOMEONE THAT
19:58:44  IS SO
POWERFUL, SO WELL RECOGNIZED
19:58:48  AROUND ALL OF THE DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES THAT
19:58:52  REPRESENT ALL OF US, ESPECIALLY HERE IN FREMONT,
19:58:56  AND OF HIGH
19:58:59  RESPECT, HIGH REVERENCE THAT WE PAY TRIBUTE
19:59:02  TO SUCH A PHENOMENAL
LEADER.
BUT ALSO ON A PERSONAL
19:59:05  NOTE, HAVING KNOWN THE FAMILY, HAVING WORKED WITH THEM ON THE
19:59:08  MARTIN LUTHER KING COMMISSION AND ALSO HAVING
19:59:12  THE DISTINCT HONOR OF HAVING HER AS
19:59:15  MYSELF WE'RE ALL MEMBERS
19:59:19  OF
ALPHA CAPA ALPHA SORORITY INCORPORATED
19:59:22 , SO EVERY TIME WE HEAR HER NAME, WE
19:59:25  HAVE HIGH REVERENCE AND HIGH RESPECT, AND I WANTED TO BE ABLE TO
19:59:28  RECOGNIZE THAT, AND THAT I WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO THANK
 EVERYONE THAT MADE
19:59:31  THIS  POSSIBLE.

19:59:34 AND IT'S AN EXCITING TIME HERE IN FREMONT WITH A LOT OF THE POSITIVE
19:59:38  CHANGES THAT ARE  OCCURRING.
SO WITH THAT, I
19:59:41  WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A MOTION TO MOVE THIS FORWARD.

19:59:51 ITEM 5A.
THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: MOTION BY COUNCILMEMBER 
19:59:54 COX AND SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER KENG.
COULD WE GET
19:59:57  A ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE?

20:00:15 VICE MAYOR SHAO, AYE.
MAYOR MEI, AYE.
>> Mayor Mei:
20:00:18  SO THE MOTION PASSES UNANIMOUSLY.
AND I ALSO WANTED
20:00:21  TO THANK CITY MANAGER KARENA SHACKELFORD
20:00:27 .
WE HAD THE PLEASURE A COUPLE YEARS AGO AND IT WAS A
20:00:30  PRETTY HISTORIC MOMENT TO HAVE BOTH THE KING FAMILY AND
20:00:34  ALSO THE CHAVEZ FAMILY
20:00:37  AND THE GANDHI FAMILY TOGETHER OVER AT THE
20:00:41  MARTIN LUTHER
KING, AND WE WERE SO FORTUNATE TO HAVE
20:00:44  A DIVERSITY OF HERITAGE AND THIS IS VERY
20:00:48  IMPORTANT FOR US IN THIS UNITED AGAINST HATE WEEK, WE'RE HOPEFULLY
20:00:51  UNITED FOR KINDNESS, AND IT WAS KINDNESS DAY
EARLIER, TO TALK ABOUT THE FACT
20:00:54  THAT WE SHOULD BE A CITY THAT IS PROUD OF OUR KINDNESS AND WELCOME
20:00:58 ING TO ALL OF OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS.
AND SO I'M VERY
20:01:01  GRATEFUL FOR THAT, AND THANK YOU FOR JOINING
20:01:04  US.
I THINK WE'RE FORTUNATE TO HAVE A LOT OF THESE
20:01:07  RESOURCES IN THE BAY AREA AND HOPEFULLY WITH THAT CENTER
20:01:10 , WE ARE ALSO GOING TO BE ABLE TO HAVE
20:01:14  SIGNAGE, AND THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS I'M VERY PROUD OF IN
THE DOWNTOWN
20:01:17  EVENT CENTER, WHERE IT'S ONES THAT CAN BE FLEXIBLE AND
20:01:22  DIGITAL SO THAT CAN MAKE IT MORE ACCESSIBLE TO ALL AND
20:01:25  HOPEFULLY HAVE BRAILLE AND SOME OTHER AREAS THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO
INCORPORATE
20:01:28  TO HELP OUR COMMUNITIES.
>> Councilmember Cox: MAYOR, MAY I HAVE A PERSONAL POINT OF
20:01:31  PRIVILEGE?
CAN WE JUST READ THIS QUOTE JUST ONE MORE
20:01:34  TIME, JUST
20:01:38  EVERYONE CAN HEAR WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT?
I
20:01:41  APPRECIATE THE OTHER WORKS WITH THE CITY, WITH OUR CITY
20:01:44  MANAGER, KARENA SHACKELFORD AND ANY OTHERS THAT WERE INVOLVED IN
20:01:47  THIS.
CORETTA SCOTT KING'S QUOTE
20:01:51  STATES THE FOLLOWING.
>> Mayor Mei: I WAS GOING TO ASK
20:01:55  -- COX THE GREATNESS OF A COMMUNITY IS MOST ACCURATELY
20:01:58  MEASURED BY THE COMPASSIONATE ACTIONS OF ITS MEMBERS
20:02:01 .

20:02:35 PUBLIC HEARING TO CONSIDER THE ISSUANCE OF TAX EXEMPT BONDS
20:02:38  FOR THE PURPOSE OF REFINANCING A MULTIFAMILY AFFORDABLE
20:02:41  HOUSING PROJECT KNOWN AS OSGOOD APARTMENTS
20:02:44 
AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECT LOCATED IN THE CITY OF FREMONT, AND
20:02:47  THE PUBLIC HEARING
20:02:51  REGARDING THE FINANCING IS REQUIRED BY
20:02:54  FEDERAL TAX LAW.
THE PUBLIC HEARING IS OPEN AND
20:02:57  WE WILL NOW HEAR FROM ANY PERSON WHO WISHES TO
20:03:00  SPEAK ABOUT THE PROPOSED FINANCING.

20:03:19 THANK YOU.

FOR THE ALAMEDA COUNTY
20:06:26  HOUSING AUTHORITY, WE DO NOT
20:06:29  HAVE ANY MEETING IN THE MONTH OF
20:06:34   NOVEMBER.
HOWEVER, WE DO HAVE PROGRAM
20:06:37  TO PROVIDE SCHOLARSHIP OR
20:06:40  TO PROVIDE SKILL TRAINING FOR
20:06:44  TENANTS IN
20:06:47  OUR PROGRAM, AND THIS MONTH WE

20:07:07  FROM THIS PROGRAM WERE CONGRATULATED
20:07:10  BY THE COMMISSIONERS AS WELL AS THE
20:07:15  EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF HATA.
, AND
20:07:18  THAT WAS CONTINUING TO SHOW THAT EVEN DURING THE PANDEMIC
20:07:21 , THIS PROGRAM STILL
20:07:24  IS SUCCESSFUL WITH HIGH PARTICIPATION
20:07:27 , AND STRONG SUPPORT
20:07:30  FROM HATA ITSELF
20:07:34 .
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
COUNCILMEMBER
20:07:37  COX?
>> Councilmember Cox: THANK YOU.
I WOULD LIKE TO
20:07:40  ALSO REPORT OUT THAT I ATTENDED AS WELL AS SOME
20:07:43  OF MY OTHER CITY COUNCILMEMBERS
20:07:47 , WE ATTENDED THE FREMONT POLICE THAT PROUDLY PRESENTED THE
20:07:51  2021 HONORS DAY FOR RECOGNIZING THE NEW HIRES,
 THE
20:07:54  PROMOTIONS AND THE RETIREMENTS, AND I JUST WANTED TO SAY
20:07:57  THAT IT WAS TRULY
20:08:01  A JOY TO SEE ALL OF THE ACHIEVEMENT OF THE FREMONT
20:08:04  POLICE AND EXCITED TO SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING NEXT, AND I
20:08:07  WANT
TO THANK THEM PERSONALLY FOR ALL OF
20:08:11  THEIR HELP, CONTINUED SERVICE
20:08:14  TO OUR COMMUNITY, AND SUPPORT IT
20:08:17 , WHICH WAS DEMONSTRATED AT THE HONORS
20:08:20  DAY SUPPORTED BY FAMILY AND FRIENDS, AND
20:08:23  ALSO THAT I DIDN'T
REALIZE AND KNOW ABOUT
20:08:27  MY FELLOW COUNCILMEMBER RICK JONES
20:08:30  BEING THE POLICE OFFICER OF THE YEAR WHEN
20:08:33  HE WAS IN THE POLICE FORCE, AND I
20:08:37  ALSO WANT TO HONOR ALL OF THOSE THAT HAVE GONE BEFORE
20:08:40  HIM, AND IT
REALLY MAKES A DIFFERENCE
20:08:44  WORKING WITH OUR POLICE AND LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS
20:08:47  COMING WEEK WITH OUR
20:08:50  SECOND SWEARING IN CEREMONY THAT'S FOR THE
20:08:54  PUBLIC WITH THEIR NEW FREMONT POLICE CHIEF, SEAN
20:08:57 
WASHINGTON.
BUT THE WHOLE FREMONT
20:09:00  POLICE DID A
20:09:03  WONDERFUL JOB ON THAT DAY AND MADE US VERY PROUD.
SO LOOK
20:09:06  FORWARD TO THE  CONTINUING COLLABORATIONS AND WHAT WE CAN DO
20:09:10  TOGETHER AS A COMMUNITY TO WORK WITH EVERY
20:09:13 ONE.

20:09:19 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
I ALSO WANTED TO GIVE OUR BEST WISHES FOR ONE OF OUR OFFICERS
20:09:22  FOR THEIR SMOOTH RECOVERY.
I KNOW THAT ONE OF OUR OFFICERS
20:09:25  WAS INJURED EARLIER THIS WEEK
20:09:28 .
AND I'D ALSO LIKE TO CALL OUT,
20:09:31  IF ANYONE COULD HELP, WE HAD A COMMUNITY MEMBER WHICH WE HAD GIVEN
20:09:34  A MOMENT OF SILENCE FOR LAST WEEK, A TODDLER
20:09:38  THAT WAS TRAGICALLY KILLED,
20:09:42  AND IF THERE'S ANYONE WHO
COULD HELP WITH THAT, I KNOW THE FAMILY
20:09:45  WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE IF PEOPLE COULD STEP FORWARD.

20:09:48 AND THEN I ALSO WANTED TO NOTE THAT
20:09:51  FOR THOSE WHO ARE LOOKING AT CHALLENGES DURING THIS HOLIDAY SEASON
20:09:54 , WE ARE AS A COMMUNITY COMING TOGETHER AND I KNOW THERE'S
20:09:57  BEEN COLLECTIONS FOR BOTH OUR HOMELESSNESS

20:10:04  GIFT CARDS, SOCKS, MITTENS AND
20:10:07  GLOVES, AND SO I'D REALLY APPRECIATE THE CONTINUED
20:10:10  SUPPORT.
AND OUR CITY IS ALSO IN THE PROCESS
20:10:14  OF CONTINUING TO PROVIDE RENTAL ASSISTANCE
20:10:18  AND THROUGH EAST BAY COMMUNITY ENERGY, WHICH
20:10:21  I KNOW COUNCILMEMBER COX AND I HAVE SERVED ON, ALONG WITH OTHERS IN
20:10:24  THE
PAST, THEY ARE ALSO PROVIDING ASSISTANCE FOR
20:10:27  RENTAL ASSISTANCE, SO THERE'S MANY DIFFERENT PROGRAMS THAT ARE AVAILABLE
20:10:30 .
THERE'S ALSO THROUGH THE FREMONT CHAMBER WHO WAS
20:10:33  PRESENTED SOME RECOGNITION EARLIER TONIGHT, THERE
20:10:37  ARE ACTIVITIES AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR JOBS, AS WELL
20:10:40  AS SKILLS TRAININGS FOR BANK JOBS AND OTHER TYPES
20:10:43 
OF OPPORTUNITIES, AND I ENCOURAGE THOSE WHO ARE SEEKING
20:10:47  THOSE OPPORTUNITIES TO LOOK AT THAT.
AND FINALLY
20:10:50  ALSO PLEASE NOTE, WE ALSO HAVE SOMETIMES
20:10:53  DIFFERENT PROGRAMS THAT ARE OPERATED AND GIVEN TO OUR
20:10:57  COMMUNITY THROUGH COMPASSIONATE NETWORK, AS WELL AS

THE MEALS
20:11:04 .
SOME OF THOSE DATES, BECAUSE OF THE HOLIDAYS,
20:11:07  HAVE BEEN MOVED, SO IF YOU COULD FOLLOW THAT, I'D ENCOURAGE YOU
20:11:10  TO LOOK AT THOSE CHANGES ON OUR WEBSITE IN FREMONT FAMILY
20:11:13  RESOURCE CENTER, AND THEN IF
YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY ALSO IF
20:11:16  YOU HAVE NEED, THE COMPASSIONATE NETWORK

20:11:23  MEALS, AS WELL AS WE WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH
