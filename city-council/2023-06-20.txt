[Captioner] 19:05:05
 SO, IF YOU'RE ON ZOOM BY PRESSING THE RAISE HAND ICON OR BY DIALING IN,

[Captioner] 19:05:14

[Captioner] 19:05:17
STATE YOUR NAME THE ORGANIZATION.


[Captioner] 19:05:24
I JUST WAS CHECKING TO SEE, DO WE HAVE ANY SPEAKERS AT THIS TIME, BOTH IN

[Captioner] 19:05:27
 THE ROOM AND ALSO ON THE ZOOM

[Captioner] 19:05:30
?
>> Ms. Gauthier: THERE ARE NO SPEAKERS 

[Captioner] 19:05:33
ON ZOOM.
MR. ABREU JUST TURNED IN A CARD.


[Captioner] 19:05:37
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:05:42
WELCOME.


[Captioner] 19:05:49
>> SO PREVIOUSLY I MENTIONED SOMETHING ABOUT

[Captioner] 19:05:52
 THE FINANCIAL REPORT OF THE CITY OF FREMONT

[Captioner] 19:05:56
.


[Captioner] 19:05:59
THE REPORTS SHOW FREMONT'S SHARE OF THE COUNTYWIDE POOL

[Captioner] 19:06:02
 FOR SALES AND USE TAX, COUNTYWIDE POOL, THAT'S THE KEY PHRASE, OVER

[Captioner] 19:06:05
 THE LAST 10 YEARS INCREASED FROM

[Captioner] 19:06:08
 14% OF THE POOL TO 27%.


[Captioner] 19:06:14
AND FREMONT'S SHARE OF THE COUNTY-WIDE POPULATION IS

[Captioner] 19:06:18
 ABOUT 14%.
SO FREMONT SEEMS TO BE

[Captioner] 19:06:21
  OUTPERFORMING THE COUNTYWIDE POOL.


[Captioner] 19:06:25
THE CITY HAS ASCRIBED ITS

[Captioner] 19:06:29
 OUTPERFORMANCE TO VOLATILE NEW AUTO SALES

[Captioner] 19:06:32
 TAX CATEGORY, WHICH IS A 1% SALES AND USE TAX.


[Captioner] 19:06:35
THE CITY SAYS THE NEW AUTO SPIKE CAUSED A CORRESPONDING SPIKE

[Captioner] 19:06:38
 IN COUNTY POOL ALLOCATION, AND ALSO NOTES THAT, QUOTE,

[Captioner] 19:06:42
 CONTINUING STRONG GROWTH IN SALES TAX FROM NEW AUTO SALES, END

[Captioner] 19:06:45
 QUOTE.
HOWEVER, OTHER CITIES HAVEN'T HAD A

[Captioner] 19:06:47
 CORRESPONDING SPIKE IN THE NEW AUTO SALES.


[Captioner] 19:06:52
AND THE VOLATILITY EXPLANATION IS DIFFICULT

[Captioner] 19:06:55
 TO UNDERSTAND.
IF YOU PULL OUT YOUR

[Captioner] 19:06:59
 CALCULATOR, YOU'LL NOTE THAT A 1%

[Captioner] 19:07:03
 TAX WOULD -- ON $38 MILLION, WHICH IS THE

[Captioner] 19:07:08
 UNEXPECTED OVERAGE IN THE REVENUES, THAT WOULD

[Captioner] 19:07:11
 CORRESPOND TO GROSS SALES OF $3.8 BILLION.


[Captioner] 19:07:18
AND NEW AUTOS ARE SELLING FOR ABOUT $48,000 A PIECE.


[Captioner] 19:07:22
SO THAT WOULD BE ABOUT 77,000 NEW AUTOS IN

[Captioner] 19:07:25
 A ONE-YEAR PERIOD.
NOW, THE

[Captioner] 19:07:28
 NUMBER OF HOUSEHOLDS IN FREMONT IS ABOUT 75,000.


[Captioner] 19:07:32
SO THAT MEANS ONE NEW AUTO FOR

[Captioner] 19:07:36
 EVERY SINGLE HOUSEHOLD IN THE CITY.


[Captioner] 19:07:39
IT'S JUST DIFFICULT TO SWALLOW.
AND I REALLY DON'T

[Captioner] 19:07:43
 THINK THAT THE HOUSEHOLDS IN FREMONT HAVE THE CAPACITY

[Captioner] 19:07:47
 TO ABSORB THAT MANY NEW CARS.


[Captioner] 19:07:51
AND CALIFORNIA HAS A POPULATION OF 39 MILLION, IT

[Captioner] 19:07:54
 PURCHASED 1.7 MILLION CARS LAST YEAR, SO FREMONT, WE'RE IN LINE WITH THE

[Captioner] 19:07:57
 STATE AVERAGE, THEN YOU WOULD EXPECT ABOUT 10,000 NEW CARS IN FREMONT.


[Captioner] 19:08:02
SO THESE ARE JUST -- YOU KNOW,

[Captioner] 19:08:05
 SANITY CHECKING ON THE NUMBERS.
AND THE NUMBERS DON'T

[Captioner] 19:08:08
 PASS THE SMELL TEST.


[Captioner] 19:08:12
NEW CAR SALES CANNOT -- NO AMOUNT OF

[Captioner] 19:08:16
 VOLATILITY THERE IS GOING TO

[Captioner] 19:08:19
 PRODUCE $3.8 BILLION

[Captioner] 19:08:23
 IN OVERAGE IN EXCESSIVE REVENUE, UNEXPECTED REVENUE.


[Captioner] 19:08:26
SO THE REAL CAUSE IS ELSEWHERE

[Captioner] 19:08:29
, AND I REALLY THINK THAT

[Captioner] 19:08:33
 YOUR ACCOUNTANTS AND YOUR POLITICIANS

[Captioner] 19:08:36
 HERE TODAY NEED TO TAKE A CLOSE LOOK AT THIS AND THINK

[Captioner] 19:08:39
 ABOUT THESE ISSUES.
NEW CAR SALES ARE NOT THE

[Captioner] 19:08:40
 CAUSE OF THE SPIKE.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:08:49
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
ARE THERE ANY OTHER

[Captioner] 19:08:53
 SPEAKERS?


[Captioner] 19:09:02
OKAY.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:09:05
AT THIS TIME, I WILL CLOSE PUBLIC

[Captioner] 19:09:09
 COMMUNICATIONS.
AND WE'LL RETURN TO

[Captioner] 19:09:12
 OUR REGULARLY SCHEDULED ITEMS.
AND WE'LL BEGIN

[Captioner] 19:09:16
 WITH ITEM 5A, WHICH IS A PUBLIC HEARING

[Captioner] 19:09:19
 FOR THE 2023 ACCESSORY DWELLING

[Captioner] 19:09:21
 UNIT ZONING, AND IT'S A TEXT AMENDMENT.


[Captioner] 19:09:24
AND WE HAVE ASSOCIATE

[Captioner] 19:09:28
 PLANNER

[Captioner] 19:09:32
 MAYANK PATEL WHO WILL I PROVIDING US

[Captioner] 19:09:35
 A PRESENTATION ALONG WITH -- JOINED BY WAYLAND.


[Captioner] 19:09:39
I SEE HIM THERE SO I'M LIKE I'M PRETTY

[Captioner] 19:09:42
 SURE.
I I WANT

[Captioner] 19:09:45
I WASN'T SURE

[Captioner] 19:09:47
 IF HE WAS HIDING.
SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR 

[Captioner] 19:09:48
PRESENTATION AT THIS TIME.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:09:58
WELCOME,

[Captioner] 19:10:03
 MAYANK.
>> THANK YOU, MAYOR, AND GOOD EVENING,

[Captioner] 19:10:06
 CITY COUNCILMEMBERS.
TONIGHT YOU WILL CONSIDER TEXT 

[Captioner] 19:10:09
AMENDMENTS TO THE FREMONT MUNICIPAL CODE, OR

[Captioner] 19:10:12
 FMC.
PRIMARILY THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS 

[Captioner] 19:10:15
INVOLVE REPEALING AND REPLACING THE CITY'S CURRENT

[Captioner] 19:10:19
 ADU ORDINANCE.
STAFF HAS ALSO PROPOSED ANCILLARY 

[Captioner] 19:10:22
CHANGES TO OTHER PARTS OF THE FMC TO ENSURE

[Captioner] 19:10:25
 INTERNAL CONSISTENCY AS THOSE CHANGES RELATE TO

[Captioner] 19:10:29
 THE CITY'S ADU ORDINANCE.
THE

[Captioner] 19:10:31
 AMENDMENTS ARE PROPOSED FOR TWO REASONS.


[Captioner] 19:10:34
FIRST, TO IMPLEMENT THE CITY'S HOUSING

[Captioner] 19:10:38
 ELEMENT, AND SECOND, TO IMPLEMENT CHANGES IN STATE LAW.


[Captioner] 19:10:46
EARLIER THIS YEAR, THE STATE DEPARTMENT

[Captioner] 19:10:49
 ON HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT

[Captioner] 19:10:53
 APPROVED THE CITY'S SIX-CYCLE HOUSING ELEMENT, WHICH COVERS THE

[Captioner] 19:10:56
 EIGHT-YEAR PLANNING PERIOD FROM 2023 TO 2031.


[Captioner] 19:11:00
AS OUTLINED IN THE HOUSING ELEMENT, A KEY COMPONENT OF

[Captioner] 19:11:04
 THE CITY'S STRATEGY FOR MEETING ITS FUTURE HOUSING NEEDS IS

[Captioner] 19:11:07
 TO ENCOURAGE THE PRODUCTION OF ADUs.


[Captioner] 19:11:11
SPECIFICALLY, IMPLEMENTATION PROGRAM 31 OF THE HOUSING

[Captioner] 19:11:15
 ELEMENT CALLS FOR AMENDING THE CITY'S

[Captioner] 19:11:18
 EXISTING ADU ORDINANCE TO ELIMINATE UNNECESSARY DEVELOPMENT

[Captioner] 19:11:21
 STANDARDS AND MAKE OTHER AMENDMENTS THAT WOULD FACILITATE

[Captioner] 19:11:25
 THE PRODUCTION OF ADUs.
THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS

[Captioner] 19:11:27
 ARE DRAFTED WITH THIS COMMITMENT IN MIND.


[Captioner] 19:11:32
SIMILARLY, THE STATE LEGISLATURE HAS ALSO MADE ITS

[Captioner] 19:11:36
 INTENT CLEAR, WHICH IS TO ADDRESS BARRIERS,

[Captioner] 19:11:39
 STREAMLINE APPROVAL, AND EXPAND POTENTIAL CAPACITY

[Captioner] 19:11:42
 FOR ADUs.
THE LEGISLATURE'S INTENT HAS BEEN

[Captioner] 19:11:46
 SPELLED OUT IN VARIOUS BILLS THAT HAVE COME -- THAT HAVE BECOME LAW OVER

[Captioner] 19:11:49
 THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS.


[Captioner] 19:12:02
SO IN OTHER WORDS, CALIFORNIA REGULATORS SEE ADUs AS

[Captioner] 19:12:05
 A POSSIBLE ANSWER TO THE STATE'S HOUSING CRISIS, AND THE LAWS

[Captioner] 19:12:08
 THAT HAVE RECENTLY COME BEFORE

[Captioner] 19:12:12
 US ARE BEFORE US AND MAY SOON BE BEFORE US,

[Captioner] 19:12:15
 ARE DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT ADUs ARE PART OF THE SOLUTION

[Captioner] 19:12:18
 TO THE PROBLEM OF HOUSING.
THIS IS

[Captioner] 19:12:22
 EVIDENCED AS STATE ADU LAW HAS EVOLVED OVER THE

[Captioner] 19:12:25
 YEARS TO LIFT REGULATIONS THAT MAY OTHERWISE

[Captioner] 19:12:28
 LIMIT ADU SIZE, LOCATION, ZONE,

[Captioner] 19:12:32
 AND OTHER DEVELOPMENT CAPACITIES.


[Captioner] 19:12:35
AS REGULATIONS HAVE EASED AND FLEXIBILITY HAS INCREASED,

[Captioner] 19:12:37
 THE PRODUCTION OF ADUs HAS ALSO INCREASED.


[Captioner] 19:12:41
THIS POSITIVE CORRELATION IS TRUE AT THE STATE AND LOCAL

[Captioner] 19:12:45
 LEVEL.
AS YOU MAY RECALL FROM

[Captioner] 19:12:48
 THE 2022 ANNUAL PROGRESS REPORT

[Captioner] 19:12:52
, 149 ADUs WERE PERMITTED IN 2022, WHICH

[Captioner] 19:12:55
 IS NEARLY TWICE AS MANY FROM 2021, AND

[Captioner] 19:12:58
 ABOUT FIVE TIMES AS MANY FROM 2018.


[Captioner] 19:13:08
TONIGHT'S CONSIDERATION IS NOT NEW IN THAT THE CITY HAS AMENDED ITS

[Captioner] 19:13:11
 ADU REGULATIONS MULTIPLE TIMES OVER THE YEARS

[Captioner] 19:13:14
 IN RESPONSE TO CHANGES IN STATE ADU LAW.


[Captioner] 19:13:18
THE LAST SET OF CODE AMENDMENTS WERE CONSIDERED BY THIS BODY A LITTLE

[Captioner] 19:13:21
 OVER TWO YEARS AGO, AND ULTIMATELY ADOPTED BY

[Captioner] 19:13:24
 THE COUNCIL IN APRIL 2021.


[Captioner] 19:13:28
THE 2021 AMENDMENTS CLARIFIED LOT COVERAGE,

[Captioner] 19:13:31
 REAR AND SIDE YARD ENCROACHMENTS, AND FIRST

[Captioner] 19:13:33
 TO SECOND STORY RATIO REQUIREMENTS FOR ADUs.


[Captioner] 19:13:37
WITH RESPECT TO TONIGHT'S ITEM, THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS

[Captioner] 19:13:39
 WERE INFORMED BY THREE DIFFERENT EXERCISES.


[Captioner] 19:13:43
THE FIRST WAS A CLOSE STUDY OF STATE LAW, OR CHANGES

[Captioner] 19:13:47
 THERETO.
THE SECOND EXERCISE INVOLVED REVIEWING 

[Captioner] 19:13:51
RECENT LETTERS FROM HCD TO JURISDICTIONS THAT HAVE ADOPTED AN

[Captioner] 19:13:54
 ADU ORDINANCE.
AND THE THIRD EXERCISE RELIED

[Captioner] 19:13:58
 ON REFERENCING HCD'S

[Captioner] 19:14:00
 ADU HANDBOOK FOR GUIDANCE AND INSIGHT WHERE THE STATE LAW WAS UNCLEAR.


[Captioner] 19:14:04
STAFF BELIEVES THIS MULTIPRONGED

[Captioner] 19:14:08
 APPROACH HAS HELPED PRODUCE AN ORDINANCE THAT IS

[Captioner] 19:14:11
 COMPLIANT WITH STATE LAW.


[Captioner] 19:14:16
SINCE THE 2021 ADU ORDINANCE UPDATE, A

[Captioner] 19:14:19
 COUPLE OF NEW BILLS WENT INTO EFFECT.
THE

[Captioner] 19:14:22
 MAIN ONES BEING ASSEMBLY BILL

[Captioner] 19:14:27
 2221 AND SENATE BILL 897.


[Captioner] 19:14:30
THE BILLS IMPOSE ADDITIONAL PROCESSING REQUIREMENTS AT THE

[Captioner] 19:14:33
 LOCAL LEVEL, AND ARE INTENDED TO CLARIFY AMBIGUITIES

[Captioner] 19:14:36
 IN EXISTING REGULATIONS.
THE MOST SIGNIFICANT

[Captioner] 19:14:40
 PROVISIONS OF THESE TWO BILLS MAKE CHANGES IN THE

[Captioner] 19:14:43
 DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS APPLICABLE TO ADUs BY REQUIRING

[Captioner] 19:14:46
 CITIES TO ALLOW ADUs TO BE TALLER

[Captioner] 19:14:49
 AND BE LOCATED CLOSER TO THE FRONT PROPERTY

[Captioner] 19:14:53
 LINE.


[Captioner] 19:15:00
THIS SLIDE NOTES ALL OF THE FM C-SECTIONS THAT ARE AFFECTED

[Captioner] 19:15:03
 BY THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS.
AS

[Captioner] 19:15:06
 PART OF THIS LIST, THE AMENDMENTS HAVE BEEN CATEGORIZED

[Captioner] 19:15:09
 INTO THREE CATEGORIES.
THE FIRST CATEGORY INCLUDES

[Captioner] 19:15:12
 CLARIFICATIONS AND/OR CORRECTIONS TO PARTS OF THE FMC

[Captioner] 19:15:16
 THAT MAKE REFERENCE TO ADUs

[Captioner] 19:15:19
 OR JADUs.
THE

[Captioner] 19:15:22
 SECOND CATEGORY INCLUDES MINOR CHANGES TO REFLECT PROPOSED ADU ORDINANCE AND

[Captioner] 19:15:26
 THE THIRD CATEGORY INCLUDES MAJOR CHANGES, WHICH INVOLVES SUBSTANTIAL

[Captioner] 19:15:28
 UPDATES AND RESTRUCTURING OF THE ORDINANCE.


[Captioner] 19:15:33
SO AS YOU'LL NOTE, THE ONLY MAJOR CHANGE TO THE EXISTING

[Captioner] 19:15:37
 ADU ORDINANCE -- THE ONLY MAJOR CHANGE IS TO THE

[Captioner] 19:15:40
 EXISTING ADU ORDINANCE, BECAUSE STAFF IS RECOMMENDING THAT IT BE

[Captioner] 19:15:44
 REPEALED AND REPLACED.


[Captioner] 19:16:00
THIS SLIDE SHOWS THE KEY STANDARDS OR REGULATIONS AS

[Captioner] 19:16:03
 THEY PERTAIN TO ADUs AND

[Captioner] 19:16:07
 JADUs, STARTING WITH LOCATION, ADUs ARE

[Captioner] 19:16:10
 PERMITTED IN ANY RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT, WHEREAS

[Captioner] 19:16:13
 JADUs ARE ONLY ALLOWED ON LOTS ZONED FOR SINGLE-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL.


[Captioner] 19:16:16
THIS IS NOT A CHANGE FROM PREVIOUS REQUIREMENTS.


[Captioner] 19:16:21
MOVING ON TO THE SIZE, ADUs CAN

[Captioner] 19:16:24
 VARY, DEPENDING ON -- SORRY.
THE SIZE OF ADUs CAN

[Captioner] 19:16:27
 VARY, DEPENDING ON WHETHER THE ADU IS A CONVERSION OF

[Captioner] 19:16:31
 EXISTING SPACE, ATTACHED TO THE PRIMARY DWELLING,

[Captioner] 19:16:34
 OR DETACHED FROM THE PRIMARY DWELLING.


[Captioner] 19:16:37
THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS WOULD ALLOW AN UNATTACHED ADU TO BE

[Captioner] 19:16:41
 A MAXIMUM OF 1,000 SQUARE FEET, AND A

[Captioner] 19:16:44
 DETACHED ADU TO BE A MAXIMUM OF 1200 SQUARE

[Captioner] 19:16:48
 FEET, REGARDLESS OF LOT SIZE, TO COMPLY WITH STATE

[Captioner] 19:16:51
 LAW.


[Captioner] 19:16:55
JADUs ON THE OTHER HAND WOULD BE LIMITED TO A MAXIMUM

[Captioner] 19:16:57
 OF 500 SQUARE FEET.
AGAIN, THIS IS NOT A CHANGE FROM 

[Captioner] 19:17:01
PREVIOUS REQUIREMENTS.
WITH RESPECT TO

[Captioner] 19:17:04
 SETBACKS, ADUs ARE SUBJECT TO A 4-FOOT SIDE AND

[Captioner] 19:17:07
 REAR YARD SETBACK, AND AS MENTIONED EARLIER, UNDER NEW

[Captioner] 19:17:10
 STATE LAW, CERTAIN ADUs COULD BE

[Captioner] 19:17:14
 LOCATED IN THE FRONT YARD.
BECAUSE

[Captioner] 19:17:17
 JADUs HAVE TO BE WITHIN THE WALLS OF A PRIMARY HOME, THEY WOULD

[Captioner] 19:17:21
 BE SUBJECT TO THE UNDERLYING SETBACKS REQUIRED FOR THE PRIMARY

[Captioner] 19:17:24
 RESIDENCE.
LIKE THE

[Captioner] 19:17:27
 SIZE UNDER NEW STATE LAW,

[Captioner] 19:17:30
 ADU HEIGHT CAN ALSO VARY ANYWHERE FROM 16 TO 30 FEET.


[Captioner] 19:17:33
THE HEIGHT ALLOWANCE DEPENDS ON,

[Captioner] 19:17:37
 ONE, THE TYPE OF ADU, AND TWO,

[Captioner] 19:17:39
 PROXIMITY TO MAJOR TRANSIT AS DEFINED BY STATE LAW.


[Captioner] 19:17:45
AGAIN, BECAUSE JADUs NEED TO BE PART OF THE PRIMARY HOME,

[Captioner] 19:17:47
 THEY ARE NOT AFFORDED DIFFERENT HEIGHT STANDARDS.


[Captioner] 19:17:56
LASTLY, AS INFORMED BY STATE LAW, ADUs WOULD NOT BE REQUIRED

[Captioner] 19:18:00
 TO PROVIDE ON-SITE PARKING UNDER THE PROPOSED

[Captioner] 19:18:04
 AMENDMENTS.
ONE ADDITIONAL NOTE HERE THAT'S

[Captioner] 19:18:07
 NOT REPRESENTED ON THE SCREEN, BECAUSE IT'S NOT A STANDARD, BUT I WOULD

[Captioner] 19:18:10
 LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT ADUs DID NOT

[Captioner] 19:18:13
 REQUIRE OWNER OCCUPANCY OR DEED RESTRICTION.


[Captioner] 19:18:17
HOWEVER, UNDER STATE LAW, JADUs DO

[Captioner] 19:18:20
 REQUIRE OWNER OCCUPANCY, AND ARE REQUIRED TO

[Captioner] 19:18:23
 PROVIDE A DEED RESTRICTION TO THE CITY PROHIBITING THE

[Captioner] 19:18:26
 SEPARATE SALE OF THAT UNIT FROM THE PRIMARY RESIDENCE.


[Captioner] 19:18:36
WITH THAT BEING THE SUMMARY OF CHANGES, STAFF RECOMMENDS THAT THE

[Captioner] 19:18:39
 CITY COUNCIL FIND THAT THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS ARE

[Captioner] 19:18:43
 EXEMPT FROM THE REQUIREMENTS OF CEQA, CONSISTENT WITH THE GENERAL

[Captioner] 19:18:47
 PLAN, AND FURTHER THE PUBLIC INTEREST,

[Captioner] 19:18:50
 CONVENIENCE, AND GENERAL WELFARE OF THE CITY, ENSURING CONSISTENCY

[Captioner] 19:18:54
 BETWEEN THE FMC, THE CITY'S GENERAL PLAN, AND STATE

[Captioner] 19:18:57
 LAW.
AND RECOMMEND THAT

[Captioner] 19:19:01
 THE CITY COUNCIL INTRODUCE AN ORDINANCE APPROVING AMENDMENTS

[Captioner] 19:19:05
 TO THE -- TO FMC TITLES 9 AND 18.


[Captioner] 19:19:15
SHOULD THE CITY COUNCIL ADOPT THE PROPOSED ORDINANCE, THE CITY WILL NEED 

[Captioner] 19:19:18
TO SUBMIT A COPY OF ITS ADU ORDINANCE

[Captioner] 19:19:21
 TO HCD WITHIN 60 DAYS AFTER

[Captioner] 19:19:24
 ADOPTION.
IN CLOSING, I WOULD

[Captioner] 19:19:27
 LIKE TO SHARE THAT THERE ARE ADDITIONAL ADU

[Captioner] 19:19:30
 BILLS CURRENTLY UNDER CONSIDERATION WITH THE STATE

[Captioner] 19:19:33
 LEGISLATURE.
IF THESE BILLS COME TO PASS, THE CITY 

[Captioner] 19:19:36
WILL NEED TO UPDATE ITS ORDINANCE TO COMPLY WITH

[Captioner] 19:19:39
 THOSE CHANGES IN THE NOT SO DISTANT FUTURE.


[Captioner] 19:19:43
ACCORDINGLY, STAFF WILL PREPARE AN AMENDMENT FOR THE CONSIDERATION BY

[Captioner] 19:19:47
 THE PLANNING COMMISSION AND CITY COUNCIL

[Captioner] 19:19:50
 TO IMPLEMENT THOSE CHANGES.


[Captioner] 19:19:57
THAT WILL CONCLUDES MY PRESENTATION.
AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS

[Captioner] 19:19:59
 YOU MAY HAVE.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.


[Captioner] 19:20:03
I APPRECIATE THE PRESENTATION AND JUST TO CLARIFY FOR THE AUDIENCE IN CASE

[Captioner] 19:20:06
 PEOPLE ARE WONDERING WHAT FMC IS, FREMONT

[Captioner] 19:20:08
 MUNICIPAL CODE.
I THINK THAT'S BEEN STATED.


[Captioner] 19:20:11
JUST IN CASE -- I KNOW THERE'S BEEN SOME REQUESTS IN THE PAST FROM MY 

[Captioner] 19:20:13
FELLOW COUNCIL TO MAKE SURE -- AND SAME WITH THE PUBLIC.


[Captioner] 19:20:16
WE USE A LOT OF ACRONYMS.
SO AT THIS TIME, I WANTED TO SEE, ARE

[Captioner] 19:20:19
 THERE ANY CLARIFYING QUESTIONS FROM THE COUNCILMEMBERS?


[Captioner] 19:20:28
COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL?
>> Councilmember Campbell: THANK YOU 

[Captioner] 19:20:30
FOR THE PRESENTATION.
I DO HAVE ONE QUICK QUESTION.


[Captioner] 19:20:35
THANKS FOR ANSWERING MY EARLIER

[Captioner] 19:20:38
 QUESTION VIA THE Q & A.
BUT I DO HAVE

[Captioner] 19:20:41
 A QUESTION  REGARDING -- IT'S

[Captioner] 19:20:44
 ON PAGE --

[Captioner] 19:20:47
 UH-OH -- 7 OF 11 OF THE SLIDES, AND IT'S WITH PARKING.


[Captioner] 19:20:51
IT'S ABOUT THE PARKING.
IT SAYS, REQUIRED PARKING SPACES,

[Captioner] 19:20:53
 AND THEN -- AND IT SAYS TANDEM PARKING.


[Captioner] 19:20:55
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THOSE TWO?


[Captioner] 19:21:00
>> TANDEM PARKING IS WHEN YOU HAVE TWO

[Captioner] 19:21:03
 VEHICLES PARKED IN VERTICAL ALIGNMENT, ONE BEHIND

[Captioner] 19:21:06
 ANOTHER.
THAT'S CALLED TANDEM PARKING.


[Captioner] 19:21:14
>> Councilmember Campbell: OKAY, SO WHAT

[Captioner] 19:21:16
 DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH THE REQUIRED PARKING?


[Captioner] 19:21:18
I'M JUST TRYING TO DRAW THE CONNECTION.


[Captioner] 19:21:21
>> SURE.
SO THERE IS ANOTHER SECTION

[Captioner] 19:21:24
 OUTSIDE OF THE CITY'S ADU

[Captioner] 19:21:28
 ORDINANCE, OUR PARKING REQUIREMENTS, OUR PARKING ORDINANCE THAT REFERENCES 

[Captioner] 19:21:31
PARKING REQUIREMENTS FOR ADUs.
AND SO THAT WAS A

[Captioner] 19:21:35
 CLEAN-UP ITEM BECAUSE THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS DO NOT REQUIRE ANY PARKING

[Captioner] 19:21:38
 FOR ADUs, SO WE HAD TO TOUCH OTHER

[Captioner] 19:21:41
 AREAS OF THE CODE TO ELIMINATE THAT REQUIREMENT.


[Captioner] 19:21:45
SO THAT'S THE CONNECTION THERE, IS ONLY

[Captioner] 19:21:48
 BY REFERENCE ONLY, BUT IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH

[Captioner] 19:21:51
 THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS.
>> Councilmember Campbell: AND FOR THE 

[Captioner] 19:21:55
TANDEM PARKING, IT'S REMOVED ALL TOGETHER, SO THERE'S NO PARKING

[Captioner] 19:21:58
 REQUIREMENTS FOR EITHER THE JUNIOR ADUs

[Captioner] 19:22:01
 OR THE ADUs?
>> JUNIOR ADUs ARE NOT SUBJECT TO 

[Captioner] 19:22:04
PARKING REQUIREMENTS.
AGAIN, BECAUSE THEY ARE -- THEY HAVE 

[Captioner] 19:22:06
TO BE WHOLLY WITHIN THE PRIMARY RESIDENCE.


[Captioner] 19:22:10
AND BASED ON STAFF'S UNDERSTANDING OF STATE

[Captioner] 19:22:13
 LAW, PARKING IS ALSO NOT REQUIRED FOR

[Captioner] 19:22:16
 ADUs.
>> Councilmember Campbell: AND THEN 

[Captioner] 19:22:20
JUST A CLARIFYING QUESTION ON SOMETHING YOU SAID EARLIER ABOUT DEED

[Captioner] 19:22:22
 RESTRICTIONS.
I THOUGHT IT APPLIED TO BOTH.


[Captioner] 19:22:26
>> OUR CURRENT ORDINANCE REQUIRES A DEED RESTRICTION FOR

[Captioner] 19:22:30
 ADUs.
AFTER STUDYING

[Captioner] 19:22:33
 THE STATE LEGISLATION MORE CLOSELY

[Captioner] 19:22:36
, WE'VE REALIZED THAT A DEED RESTRICTION IS NOT REQUIRED

[Captioner] 19:22:39
 FOR THE ACCESSORY DWELLING UNIT, HOWEVER, UNDER STATE

[Captioner] 19:22:43
 LAW, THE CITY IS REQUIRED TO HAVE

[Captioner] 19:22:46
 A DEED RESTRICTION OR HAVE

[Captioner] 19:22:50
 APPLICANTS PROVIDE A DEED RESTRICTION FOR JUNIOR

[Captioner] 19:22:53
 ADUs.
>> Councilmember Campbell: BUT YOU 

[Captioner] 19:22:56
CAN'T SELL THE PROPERTY WITHOUT

[Captioner] 19:23:00
 SELLING THE ADUs WITH THE PROPERTY, SO WHY WOULDN'T IT BE DEEDED

[Captioner] 19:23:03
 TOGETHER?


[Captioner] 19:23:06
>> I'M SORRY, COULD YOU CLARIFY YOUR QUESTION?


[Captioner] 19:23:08
DEED IT TOGETHER --
>> Councilmember Campbell: RIGHT, SO I 

[Captioner] 19:23:12
HAVE A HOUSE AND I WANT TO BUILD AN ADU ON IT, NOT A

[Captioner] 19:23:15
 JUNIOR.
AND IT BECOMES A PART OF

[Captioner] 19:23:18
 MY EXISTING PROPERTY.


[Captioner] 19:23:22
AND THEN I DECIDE I WANT TO SELL IT.
THEY BOTH HAVE TO BE

[Captioner] 19:23:25
 SOLD AT THE SAME TIME, SO DOES THE

[Captioner] 19:23:28
 -- DO YOU HAVE TO REDO THE DEED WHEN YOU ADD IT OR YOU DON'T?


[Captioner] 19:23:32
>> SO LET ME TRY TO EXPLAIN THIS A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY.


[Captioner] 19:23:36
>> Mayor Mei: MAY I ASK A FAVOR?
IF YOU'RE NOT SPEAKING AT THIS TIME,

[Captioner] 19:23:39
 PLEASE MUTE YOUR MICS BECAUSE I KNOW THERE'S SOME SIDE NOISE, I'M NOT SURE 

[Captioner] 19:23:41
WHERE IT'S COMING FROM.
SO IF YOU DON'T SEE THE RED LIGHT, IT 

[Captioner] 19:23:44
MEANS YOUR MIC IS NOT MUTED.
THANKS.


[Captioner] 19:23:47
I JUST DON'T KNOW WHERE THAT'S COMING FROM.


[Captioner] 19:23:55
>> City Mgr. Shackelford: GO AHEAD,

[Captioner] 19:23:56
 MAYANK.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:23:59
>> SO WITH RESPECT TO

[Captioner] 19:24:03
 THE DIFFERENT REQUIREMENTS UNDER GOVERNMENT CODE FOR ADUs AND

[Captioner] 19:24:07
 JUNIOR ADUs, THERE IS A LIST OF PROVISIONS THAT --

[Captioner] 19:24:10
 OR REGULATIONS THAT NEED TO BE INCLUDED IN OUR ORDINANCE.


[Captioner] 19:24:13
WITH RESPECT TO THE ADUs

[Captioner] 19:24:16
, AND WE'RE JUST LIMITED TO THAT WHICH IS IN THE

[Captioner] 19:24:20
 STATUTE, SO THERE'S NOTHING IN THAT GOVERNMENT

[Captioner] 19:24:24
 CODE THAT SAYS, HEY, CITY, YOU HAVE TO

[Captioner] 19:24:27
 REQUIRE ADUs TO PROVIDE SOME SORT OF DEED RESTRICTION.


[Captioner] 19:24:30
NOW THAT DOES NOT MEAN YOU CAN SELL THE ADU SEPARATELY FROM

[Captioner] 19:24:33
 THE PRIMARY DWELLING.
THAT GOES WITHOUT

[Captioner] 19:24:36
 SAYING.


[Captioner] 19:24:40
WHEREAS THE GOVERNMENT CODE FOR JUNIOR ADUs EX-BLESS

[Captioner] 19:24:43
 EXPLICITLY STATES THAT WHEN A LOCAL

[Captioner] 19:24:46
 JURISDICTION ADOPTS AN ORDINANCE, IT MUST CONTAIN THIS REQUIREMENT, AND, 

[Captioner] 19:24:48
THEREFORE, WE HAVE THAT REQUIREMENT FOR JUNIOR ADUs.


[Captioner] 19:24:51
NOW, AS TO WHY ONE IS

[Captioner] 19:24:55
 REQUIRED, WHY A DEED RESTRICTION IS REQUIRED FOR A JUNIOR ADU AND NOT

[Captioner] 19:24:58
 AN ADU, I'M NOT SURE WHAT

[Captioner] 19:25:01
 THE STATE LEGISLATURE HAS IN MIND.
HOWEVER, ONE OF THE BILLS

[Captioner] 19:25:04
 THAT ARE CURRENTLY UNDER CONSIDERATION

[Captioner] 19:25:08
 IS THE POSSIBLE SELL OF ADUs SEPARATELY FROM THE

[Captioner] 19:25:11
 PRIMARY DWELLING.
NOW, THAT HASN'T PASSED YET,

[Captioner] 19:25:14
 BUT IT IS UNDER CONSIDERATION AND MAYBE

[Captioner] 19:25:17
 THAT'S ONE REASON WHY ADUs DON'T HAVE THAT LIMITATION.


[Captioner] 19:25:23
>> Councilmember Campbell: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:25:27
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
NEXT FOR CLARIFYING

[Captioner] 19:25:31
 QUESTIONS IS VICE MAYOR COX.


[Captioner] 19:25:37
>> Vice Mayor Cox: THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE INFORMATION, ESPECIALLY 

[Captioner] 19:25:40
BREAKING IT DOWN IN YOUR PRESENTATION, WHICH REALLY HELPS.


[Captioner] 19:25:43
I LIKE THE CHARTS.
AND

[Captioner] 19:25:47
 MAKING IT SIMPLER TO UNDERSTAND.
I HAD A GENERAL

[Captioner] 19:25:50
 QUESTION.
AND I GOT A COUPLE CALL

[Captioner] 19:25:54
S ABOUT THIS.
WHAT IS

[Captioner] 19:25:57
 PREVENTING SOMEONE FROM TURNING THEIR

[Captioner] 19:26:01
 ADU UNIT INTO A

[Captioner] 19:26:04
 B & B?


[Captioner] 19:26:12
>> THERE IS A REQUIREMENT UNDER

[Captioner] 19:26:16
 STATE LAW AND INCLUDED IN OUR

[Captioner] 19:26:19
 ORDINANCE THAT ADUs

[Captioner] 19:26:22
 AND JUNIOR ADUs CANNOT BE USED FOR SHORT-TERM

[Captioner] 19:26:25
 RENTALS.
>> Vice Mayor

[Captioner] 19:26:28
 Cox: AND COULD YOU DEFINE WHAT SHORT TERM

[Captioner] 19:26:31
 RENTALS MEAN?
>> SHORT TERM RENTAL MEANS A RENTAL 

[Captioner] 19:26:34
THAT IS LESS THAN 30 DAYS.


[Captioner] 19:26:39
>> Vice Mayor Cox: BUT SOMEONE COULD THEN RENT IT

[Captioner] 19:26:41
 31 DAYS?
>> THAT'S CORRECT.


[Captioner] 19:26:45
>> Vice Mayor Cox: DID YOU SEE ANYTHING PENDING

[Captioner] 19:26:49
 IN THE PENDING BILLS THAT MIGHT ADDRESS SOMETHING TO THAT

[Captioner] 19:26:52
 EFFECT?
>>

[Captioner] 19:26:55
 NO, ANY RENT -- SHORT TERM

[Captioner] 19:26:59
 RENTALS, ANYTHING MORE THAN -- THAT'S GOING TO BE AT LEAST A MONTH

[Captioner] 19:27:02
 OR MORE, 30 DAYS AND GREATER

[Captioner] 19:27:05
, IT WOULD SEEM TO NOT HAVE THE

[Captioner] 19:27:09
 SAME POTENTIAL ADVERSE IMPACTS AS, SAY, A SHORT-TERM

[Captioner] 19:27:13
 RENTAL TO YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD.
THE STATE IS PRETTY

[Captioner] 19:27:17
 CLEAR THAT THESE

[Captioner] 19:27:20
 REGULATIONS HAVE BEEN DESIGNED

[Captioner] 19:27:23
 TO PROVIDE MORE LONG-TERM

[Captioner] 19:27:26
 AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN COMMUNITIES, AND THAT'S WHY,

[Captioner] 19:27:30
 AGAIN, IT'S STATE LAW THAT SAYS THESE UNITS ARE NOT MEANT TO BE

[Captioner] 19:27:33
 USED FOR SHORT TERM RENTALS, IN FACT, THEY'RE PROHIBITED,

[Captioner] 19:27:36
 BUT WITH SPECIFIC ADDITIONAL REGULATIONS

[Captioner] 19:27:40
 THAT ARE MAYBE UNDER CONSIDERATION, I HAVE NOT

[Captioner] 19:27:43
 SEEN ANYTHING UNDER THIS

[Captioner] 19:27:46
 CURRENT LEGISLATIVE CYCLE.
>> Vice Mayor Cox: OKAY.


[Captioner] 19:27:52
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.


[Captioner] 19:27:54
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
AND I BELIEVE THAT'S THE LAST OF OUR 

[Captioner] 19:27:56
COUNCIL CLARIFYING QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME.


[Captioner] 19:27:59
I'D LIKE TO TURN IT -- OPEN THE PUBLIC HEARING AT THIS

[Captioner] 19:28:02
 TIME.


[Captioner] 19:28:06
AND I'D LIKE TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WISHING TO SPEAK

[Captioner] 19:28:09
 ON THIS AGENDA ITEM, ON ZOOM MAY DO SO AT

[Captioner] 19:28:12
 THIS TIME BY PRESSING THE RAISE HAND ICON OR, IF BY DIALING

[Captioner] 19:28:15
 IN, BY PRESSING STAR NINE, AND I DON'T KNOW IF WE HAVE

[Captioner] 19:28:18
 ANY SPEAKER CARDS HERE FOR THIS ITEM?
>> Ms. Gauthier: WE DO HAVE A CARD

[Captioner] 19:28:22
 TURNED IN.


[Captioner] 19:28:24
NAREN IMADI.
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY.


[Captioner] 19:28:27
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:28:33
WELCOME.
>> GOOD EVENING, EVERYONE.


[Captioner] 19:28:36
SO IT'S JUST -- I'M JUST THINKING OUT LOUD.


[Captioner] 19:28:40
IN 2019, WE THOUGHT OF EXTENDING OUR HOME, LIKE ADDING

[Captioner] 19:28:43
 A FEW SQUARE FEET, AND THEN WHEN WE REACHED

[Captioner] 19:28:47
 OUT TO PROBABLY 8 TO 10

[Captioner] 19:28:50
 DESIGNERS AND CONSTRUCTING COMPANIES, CONSTRUCTION COMPANIES, EVERYONE

[Captioner] 19:28:53
 SAID, HEY,

[Captioner] 19:28:56
 OUR FIRST INTENTION IS TO ADD ADU BECAUSE IT'S EASIER,

[Captioner] 19:29:00
 BUT EVERYONE AT THAT TIME SAID IT'S VERY HARD

[Captioner] 19:29:03
 FOR THE CITY TO APPROVE AN ADU BECAUSE WE

[Captioner] 19:29:06
 ARE CLOSE TO OVER FAULT

[Captioner] 19:29:09
 ZONE, SEISMIC ZONE, SO THE EXISTING AREAS USUALLY WON'T HAVE

[Captioner] 19:29:12
 THE SAME BUILDING CODES AS THE MAIN RESIDENCE.


[Captioner] 19:29:16
SO THERE IS A RISK INVOLVED IN ADDING

[Captioner] 19:29:19
 AN ADU AT THAT TIME, SO IT WAS A BIT TIGHTER FOR THE CITY TO

[Captioner] 19:29:23
 APPROVE ANY OF THE AREA, SO WE JUST THOUGHT OKAY, WE'LL

[Captioner] 19:29:26
 JUST LEAVE IT OUT.
AND THEN LAST YEAR, WHEN WE AGAIN

[Captioner] 19:29:29
 REACHED OUT ONE MORE TIME TO

[Captioner] 19:29:32
 DESIGNERS, EVERYONE AT THIS TIME, LIKE, SAID, WE'LL DO

[Captioner] 19:29:35
 ADUs, BECAUSE CITY IS RIGHT NOW APPROVING ADUs EASILY.


[Captioner] 19:29:39
SO MY QUESTION IS, LIKE, WHAT HAS CHANGED, LIKE, IN

[Captioner] 19:29:42
 THIS THREE YEARS, ALL OF A SUDDEN, OUR AREA

[Captioner] 19:29:45
 HAS BECAME LIKE LESS

[Captioner] 19:29:49
 RISK-PRONE FOR EARTHQUAKES?


[Captioner] 19:29:52
I TRIED TO SEE THE ORDINANCE LIKE, YOU KNOW, IF THERE ARE ANY

[Captioner] 19:29:55
 ADDITIONAL BUILDING PERMITS THAT WERE

[Captioner] 19:29:59
 ADDED AS PART OF THESE CHANGES THAT WE ARE

[Captioner] 19:30:02
 DOING FOR THE ADU ORDINANCE AND I HAVEN'T SEEN ANY, SO I DON'T

[Captioner] 19:30:05
 KNOW WHETHER THERE ARE ANY OR NOT, ESPECIALLY

[Captioner] 19:30:08
 WHEN WE ARE INCREASING THE EXISTING

[Captioner] 19:30:11
 FLOOR AREA SIZE LIMIT TO 30 FEET AND IT

[Captioner] 19:30:15
 ALSO EXPLICITLY SAYS IT CAN'T BE THREE FLOORS, WHICH

[Captioner] 19:30:18
 MEANS IT CAN BE TWO FLOORS.
SO BASICALLY WE ARE

[Captioner] 19:30:21
 EXTENDING THE SIZE TO 1200 SQUARE FEET,

[Captioner] 19:30:24
 1200 -- YEAH, SQUARE FEET AND THEN TWO STORIES, IT'S ALMOST AS

[Captioner] 19:30:27
 EQUAL TO TYPICAL THOUSAND TO 1200

[Captioner] 19:30:30
 SINGLE-FAMILY HOMES, RESIDENCES IN FREMONT, BY SIZE

[Captioner] 19:30:34
 AND BY UNIT CAPACITY.


[Captioner] 19:30:39
SO IDEALLY I FEEL LIKE IT SHOULD HAVE STRINGENT

[Captioner] 19:30:42
 BUILDING CODES BECAUSE IT'S ALMOST AS EQUAL TO A PRIMARY RESIDENCE, BUT

[Captioner] 19:30:45
 I DON'T SEE ANYTHING AS SUCH.
SO THAT PART IS MISSING.


[Captioner] 19:30:49
AND ANOTHER THING IS, SAYING LIKE WE DON'T

[Captioner] 19:30:52
 NEED PARKING AT ALL FOR ANY OF THESE RESIDENCES,

[Captioner] 19:30:55
 I DON'T KNOW IF IT IS LIKE THE RIGHT

[Captioner] 19:30:58
 THING TO DO OR NOT, ESPECIALLY WE ARE HAVING SO MUCH CRIME

[Captioner] 19:31:01
 GOING ON, ESPECIALLY THE LAST THREE TO SIX MONTHS IF

[Captioner] 19:31:05
 YOU ARE SEEING NEXT DOOR OR ANYTHING, WE ARE SEEING EVERYDAY NOT

[Captioner] 19:31:09
 JUST BREAKINS, LITERALLY PEOPLE ARE STEALING

[Captioner] 19:31:12
 CAR, SO NOW WITH THESE ADUs, ADDITIONAL CARS WILL BE ON

[Captioner] 19:31:15
 THE STREET BECAUSE THERE IS NO PARKING REQUIREMENT OR --

[Captioner] 19:31:18
 THAT WILL PROBABLY INCREASE THE CRIME AS WELL ON THAT

[Captioner] 19:31:20
 ASPECT, UNLESS WE TACKLE IT IN A DIFFERENT WAY.


[Captioner] 19:31:22
SO JUST MY THOUGHTS.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:31:28
>> Ms. Gauthier: THAT'S THE LAST SPEAKER.


[Captioner] 19:31:32
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
AT THIS TIME, I'LL CLOSE THE

[Captioner] 19:31:35
 PUBLIC COMMUNICATIONS.
AND I'LL BRING IT BACK TO THE COUNCIL 

[Captioner] 19:31:38
FOR DISCUSSIONS.


[Captioner] 19:31:56
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN.


[Captioner] 19:31:59
>> Councilmember Salwan: IF THERE WAS NO DISCUSSION, I'M HAPPY TO MAKE

[Captioner] 19:32:02
 THE MOTION TO MOVE THIS FORWARD.
>> Vice Mayor

[Captioner] 19:32:05
 Cox: SECOND.
>> Mayor Mei: I

[Captioner] 19:32:08
 SEE ALSO A MOTION AND A SECOND.


[Captioner] 19:32:12
I WOULD CALL A VOTE BUT I KNOW COUNCILMEMBER KENG, DID YOU WANT

[Captioner] 19:32:14
 TO MAKE A SECOND?
IS THAT WHAT YOU WERE DOING OR DID YOU 

[Captioner] 19:32:18
HAVE -- OKAY.
SEEING THAT WE HAVE A MOTION AND

[Captioner] 19:32:21
 A SECOND, THE ONLY THING I JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY FOR THOSE IN THE

[Captioner] 19:32:24
 AUDIENCE THAT WANTED TO KNOW, THE PARKING CHANGES HAVE TO

[Captioner] 19:32:27
 DO WITH THE STATE DECISION ON A LOT OF DIFFERENT

[Captioner] 19:32:30
 HOUSING, AND IT'S NOT JUST UNIQUE TO ADUs, BUT THEY'RE TRYING TO

[Captioner] 19:32:33
 REMOVE THAT.
AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE ALSO

[Captioner] 19:32:37
 LOOKING AT FOR THE

[Captioner] 19:32:40
 QUESTION THAT CAME YOU THE, LOOKING AT SOME SHORT TERM RENTAL

[Captioner] 19:32:43
 ORDINANCES, JUST TO LET PEOPLE KNOW.
WE HAVE A MOTION AND SECOND.


[Captioner] 19:32:46
PLEASE CALL THE VOTE.


[Captioner] 19:32:56
SO THE MOTION PASSES UNANIMOUSLY.


[Captioner] 19:33:00
>> WHEN YOU'RE READY, I'LL READ THE TITLE INTO THE RECORD.


[Captioner] 19:33:03
>> Mayor Mei: I WAS GOING TO ASK IF YOU WOULD BE SO KIND.


[Captioner] 19:33:05
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: AN ORDINANCE OF THE CITY OF THE FREMONT TO REPEAL 

[Captioner] 19:33:09
AND REPLACE FREMONT MUNICIPAL CODE

[Captioner] 19:33:12
 SECTION 18.190.005, ACCESSORY DWELLING UNITS, TO

[Captioner] 19:33:15
 COMPLY WITH NEW STATE LAW AS WELL AS TO CARRY OUT PROGRAM

[Captioner] 19:33:19
 IMPLEMENTATION FROM THE CITY'S 2023

[Captioner] 19:33:22
 THROUGH 2031 HOUSING ELEMENT, AND AMEND OTHER RELATED CODE

[Captioner] 19:33:25
 SECTIONS OF THE FREMONT MUNICIPAL CODE TITLE IX,

[Captioner] 19:33:28
 AND TITLE 18, AND

[Captioner] 19:33:31
 MAKING FINDINGS OF CEQA EXEMPTION.
THANK YOU, MAYOR.


[Captioner] 19:33:36
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU FOR READING THOSE INTO THE PUBLIC RECORDS.


[Captioner] 19:33:41
NEXT ON OUR AGENDA THIS EVENING IS

[Captioner] 19:33:45
 ITEM 6A AS IN APPLE, AND IT'S THE CLIMATE READY FREMONT

[Captioner] 19:33:48
 PUBLIC DRAFT.
AND I'D LIKE TO WELCOME OUR

[Captioner] 19:33:51
 SUSTAINABILITY MANAGER, RACHEL DIFRANCO, AS WELL AS OUR COMMUNITY

[Captioner] 19:33:54
 DEVELOPMENT DIRECTOR, DAN SCHOENHOLZ, WHO WILL PROVIDE US

[Captioner] 19:33:56
 A PRESENTATION THIS EVENING.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:34:03
>> GOOD

[Captioner] 19:34:06
 EVENING, MAYOR MEI AND COUNCIL.
I'M HAPPY TO COME TONIGHT TO PRESENT 

[Captioner] 19:34:09
TO YOU THE DRAFT UPDATE OF OUR CLIMATE ACTION PLAN.


[Captioner] 19:34:14
THE TITLE OF THE DRAFT CLIMATE PLAN IS CLIMATE READY FREMONT,

[Captioner] 19:34:17
 FREMONT'S PATHWAY TO A LOW-CARBON, SUSTAINABLE AND RESILIENT FUTURE.


[Captioner] 19:34:20
THIS IS AN UPDATE TO OUR 2012 CLIMATE

[Captioner] 19:34:24
 ACTION PLAN THAT WAS ADOPTED A YEAR

[Captioner] 19:34:27
 AFTER THE GENERAL PLAN, AND IT'S A

[Captioner] 19:34:30
 ROAD MAP FOR WHAT WE CAN DO IN THE CITY

[Captioner] 19:34:33
 WITH LOCAL ACTIONS TO

[Captioner] 19:34:37
 ACHIEVE LONG TERM CARBON NEUTRALITY GOAL OF THE CITY THAT WAS ADOPTED

[Captioner] 19:34:41
 BACK IN 2019.
FOR 2045

[Captioner] 19:34:44
 CARBON NEUTRALITY, AND IT PRESENTS BOTH SOME SHORT TERM AND

[Captioner] 19:34:47
 KIND OF LONGER TERM MEASURES AND ACTIONS RELATED TO

[Captioner] 19:34:50
 WHAT WE CAN DO.


[Captioner] 19:34:55
SO JUST A QUICK BACKGROUND.
IN OUR GENERAL

[Captioner] 19:34:58
 PLAN THAT WAS ADOPTED IN 2011, WE HAVE A VISION

[Captioner] 19:35:02
 OF TRANSITIONING FROM AB

[Captioner] 19:35:05
 AUTO ORIENTED SUBURB NO A

[Captioner] 19:35:07
 SUSTAINABLE, STRATEGICALLY URBAN, MODERN CITY.


[Captioner] 19:35:10
WE PRESENTED OUR FIRST CLIMATE ACTION PLAN WHICH WAS A ROAD MAP FOR

[Captioner] 19:35:14
 ACHIEVING THAT GOAL AND SPECIFICALLY SET A

[Captioner] 19:35:17
 25% GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION REDUCTION TARGET

[Captioner] 19:35:21
 TO ACHIEVE BY THE YEAR 2020 FROM A 2005

[Captioner] 19:35:24
 BASELINE LEVEL.
SO THAT'S LOOKING AT CARBON

[Captioner] 19:35:27
 EMISSIONS ASSOCIATED WITH ACTIVITIES THAT ARE HAPPENING IN FREMONT, 

[Captioner] 19:35:30
PRIMARILY FROM THE BUILDING SECTOR, THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR, AND THE

[Captioner] 19:35:33
 WASTE AND WATER SECTORS.


[Captioner] 19:35:39
THE CLIMATE ACTION PLAN UPDATE ALIGNS WITH SOME

[Captioner] 19:35:42
 ESTABLISHED TARGETS ALREADY ADOPTED IN THE CITY OF

[Captioner] 19:35:45
 FREMONT, AND TARGETS THAT HAVE BEEN ADOPTED BY

[Captioner] 19:35:48
 THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.
SO AS I MENTIONED IN

[Captioner] 19:35:51
 2019, FREMONT CITY COUNCIL ADOPTED A CARBON NEUTRALITY RESOLUTION THAT

[Captioner] 19:35:54
 WAS RECOMMENDED BY OUR ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY COMMISSION,

[Captioner] 19:35:58
 AND THAT WAS TO ACHIEVE CARBON NEUTRALITY BY THE

[Captioner] 19:36:01
 YEAR 2045, AND ALSO TO ACHIEVE AN INTERIM TARGET

[Captioner] 19:36:05
 OF 55% GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS BY THE YEAR 2030.


[Captioner] 19:36:09
THIS ALIGNS WITH A VARIETY OF

[Captioner] 19:36:13
 ADOPTED CALIFORNIA POLICIES.
BACK IN 2005, THE STATE

[Captioner] 19:36:16
 PUT FORWARD AN EXECUTIVE ORDER TO REDUCE STATEWIDE

[Captioner] 19:36:19
 GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS TO 1990 LEVELS BY THE

[Captioner] 19:36:23
 YEAR 2020, AND TO ACHIEVE A TARGET OF

[Captioner] 19:36:26
 80% BELOW THOSE 1990 LEVELS BY THE YEAR

[Captioner] 19:36:30
 2050.
AND ON THE COATTAILS OF THAT,

[Captioner] 19:36:33
 AB32, THE GLOBAL WARMING SOLUTIONS ACT, ESTABLISHED REGULATORY

[Captioner] 19:36:36
 AUTHORITY UNDER THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD TO ACHIEVE THOSE 

[Captioner] 19:36:40
GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION TARGETS.
IN 2016,

[Captioner] 19:36:43
 SB32 SET AN INTERIM TARGET TO

[Captioner] 19:36:47
 ACHIEVE THE STATEWIDE GREENHOUSE

[Captioner] 19:36:50
 GAS REDUCTIONS BY 40%

[Captioner] 19:36:53
 BELOW 1990 LEVELS BY THE YEAR 2030 AND MOST RECENTLY,

[Captioner] 19:36:57
 AB1279 SAID THAT THE STATE WILL ACHIEVE NET ZERO GREENHOUSE GAS

[Captioner] 19:37:00
 EMISSIONS NO LATER THAN THE YEAR 2045 AND TO

[Captioner] 19:37:04
 REDUCE ANTHROPOGENIC GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS SO

[Captioner] 19:37:07
 ANY HUMAN CAUSED GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS BY AT LEAST

[Captioner] 19:37:11
 85% BY THE YEAR 2050.


[Captioner] 19:37:15
SO IN DEVELOPING THIS UPDATE TO OUR CLIMATE

[Captioner] 19:37:19
 ACTION PLAN, WE STARTED WITH SOME ROBUST COMMUNITY OUTREACH AND

[Captioner] 19:37:23
 LAUNCHED ACTUALLY RIGHT AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC, SO ALL

[Captioner] 19:37:26
 OF OUR COMMUNITY OUTREACH AND

[Captioner] 19:37:30
 VARIOUS SURVEYS

[Captioner] 19:37:33
 AND -- WE HAD A WHOLE SERIES OF CLIMATE TALKS, ALL OF

[Captioner] 19:37:36
 THAT WAS DONE VIRTUALLY.


[Captioner] 19:37:39
SO WE ACTUALLY, THROUGH THOSE VARIOUS EVENTS, HEARD

[Captioner] 19:37:43
 FROM -- WE HAD OVER 500 EVENT PARTICIPANTS,

[Captioner] 19:37:46
 HEARD FROM 145 ONLINE COMMUNITY FORUM PARTICIPANTS.


[Captioner] 19:37:49
WE LAUNCHED AN ONLINE FORUM THAT

[Captioner] 19:37:52
 ALLOWED PEOPLE TO RESPOND TO POTENTIAL MEASURES FOR

[Captioner] 19:37:56
 THE CLIMATE ACTION PLAN, AND WE HAD A SERIES OF

[Captioner] 19:37:59
 STAKEHOLDER GROUP MEETINGS AS WELL.
AND WE HEARD, YOU KNOW, A VARIETY OF

[Captioner] 19:38:02
 THINGS.
PEOPLE REALLY WANT TO SEE THAT

[Captioner] 19:38:05
 WE CAN SHIFT EQUITILY TO 100% CLEAN AND

[Captioner] 19:38:08
 RENEWABLE POWER.
THEY REALLY WANT TO SEE ON-SITE SOLAR

[Captioner] 19:38:12
 AND ENERGY STORAGE.
WHEN IT COMES TO LAND

[Captioner] 19:38:15
 USE AND MOBILITY, THEY WANT TO SEE MORE EV CHARGING

[Captioner] 19:38:18
 INFRASTRUCTURE, THEY WANT TO SEE SUPPORT OF LOW CARBON

[Captioner] 19:38:21
 DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF REGIONAL TRANSIT.


[Captioner] 19:38:25
IN THE NATURAL AND URBAN LANDSCAPE

[Captioner] 19:38:27
 SPACE.
PEOPLE WANT TO SEE THAT WE CAN 

[Captioner] 19:38:31
SEQUESTER OR DRAW DOWN GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS LOCALLY THROUGH

[Captioner] 19:38:34
 THE USE OF OUR URBAN FOREST, LOCAL URBAN

[Captioner] 19:38:37
 FARMING, AND THEY ALSO WANT TO SEE US PROMOTE

[Captioner] 19:38:40
 NATURE-BASED SHORELINE RESILIENCE.
IN THE MATERIALS WASTE

[Captioner] 19:38:44
 AND WATER AREA, OUR COMMUNITY WANTS TO SEE A DECREASE IN

[Captioner] 19:38:47
 PACKAGING WASTE AND INCREASE IN STORMWATER CAPTURE

[Captioner] 19:38:50
 AND WATER RE-USE, ESPECIALLY DURING TIMES OF DROUGHT, AND

[Captioner] 19:38:54
 TO PROMOTE MATERIAL RE-USE IN THE SHARING OF MATERIALS.


[Captioner] 19:38:57
AND THEN WHEN IT COMES TO HEALTH AND

[Captioner] 19:39:00
 RESILIENCY, OUR COMMUNITY REALLY WANTS TO SEE THE REDUCTION IN THE URBAN

[Captioner] 19:39:04
 HEAT ISLAND EFFECT.
THEY WANT TO SEE

[Captioner] 19:39:07
 US PROTECT AGAINST CLIMATE-RELATED DISASTERS LIKE

[Captioner] 19:39:11
 DROUGHT, EXTREME HEAT, AND THEY WANT US

[Captioner] 19:39:14
 TO SEE -- TO EXPAND OUR CLIMATE EMERGENCY

[Captioner] 19:39:14
 PREPAREDNESS EDUCATION OF THE COMMUNITY.


[Captioner] 19:39:20
NEXT SLIDE.
IN TERMS OF

[Captioner] 19:39:23
 WHO WE ENGAGED, YOU CAN SEE THERE ARE A NUMBER OF

[Captioner] 19:39:27
 DIFFERENT COMMUNITY GROUPS THAT WE

[Captioner] 19:39:30
 ENGAGED THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS IN 2020 AND

[Captioner] 19:39:33
 INTO 2021.
INCLUDING A NUMBER OF CITY DEPARTMENTS 

[Captioner] 19:39:37
AND DIVISIONS.
PRESENTATIONS TO

[Captioner] 19:39:41
 SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF OUR BOARDS,

[Captioner] 19:39:44
 COMMISSIONS, THE CITY, SCHOOL DISTRICT LIAISON COMMITTEE.


[Captioner] 19:39:47
WE ALSO TALKED WITH A NUMBER

[Captioner] 19:39:50
 OF BUSINESSES AND ESPECIALLY

[Captioner] 19:39:54
 CLEANTECH, BIOTECH SECTOR, THE DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY AS

[Captioner] 19:39:57
 WELL, DIFFERENT HOUSING ORGANIZATIONS.


[Captioner] 19:40:00
WE SPOKE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS IN FREMONT, INCLUDING

[Captioner] 19:40:05
 FIERCE, LEAF, THE ECOLOGY CENTER, WE TALKED

[Captioner] 19:40:09
 WITH BOY SCOUT AND GIRL SCOUT GROUPS AND YOUTH IN GENERAL, A

[Captioner] 19:40:12
 LOT OF HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS, AND THEN WE ALSO SPOKE WITH A NUMBER OF OUR

[Captioner] 19:40:15
 REGIONAL AGENCIES THAT WE WORK CLOSELY WITH IN TERMS OF THE WATER DISTRICT, 

[Captioner] 19:40:19
THE FREMONT UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT, EAST BAY COMMUNITY ENERGY,

[Captioner] 19:40:22
 OUR LOCAL CLEAN ENERGY SUPPLIER,

[Captioner] 19:40:26
 PG&E, STOPWASTE AND THE BAY AREA QUALITY MANAGEMENT

[Captioner] 19:40:29
 DISTRICT.
SO THE OBJECTIVE AND VISION OF CLIMATE

[Captioner] 19:40:32
 READY FREMONT IS TO ACHIEVE A HEALTHY, SAFE AND

[Captioner] 19:40:35
 LIVABLE CLIMATE READY COMMUNITY THAT CAN PROVIDE FOR ECONOMIC

[Captioner] 19:40:38
 AND SOCIAL OPPORTUNITY ACROSS ALL AGES, CULTURES

[Captioner] 19:40:42
 AND ABILITIES THROUGH EQUITABLE, RESILIENT, AND

[Captioner] 19:40:45
 ADAPTIVE TECHNOLOGIES, INFRASTRUCTURE, POLICIES,

[Captioner] 19:40:48
 AND PROGRAMS.
AND THE GOALS

[Captioner] 19:40:51
 OF CLIMATE READY FREMONT ARE TO,

[Captioner] 19:40:55
 ONE, OVERALL REDUCE OUR GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS,

[Captioner] 19:40:58
 AND TWO, TO BUILD COMMUNITY RESILIENCE TO PREPARE

[Captioner] 19:41:01
 FOR AND ADAPT TO THE

[Captioner] 19:41:04
 CHANGING CLIMATE AROUND US.


[Captioner] 19:41:09
IN ADDITION TO CLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION,

[Captioner] 19:41:12
 WHICH IS THE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION REDUCTION

[Captioner] 19:41:15
 AND ADAPTATION AND RESILIENCY, WE'RE ALSO PRESENTING A

[Captioner] 19:41:18
 PLAN THAT WILL ALIGN WITH THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT.


[Captioner] 19:41:21
SO THIS IS A CEQA

[Captioner] 19:41:25
 STREAMLINE CLIMATE ACTION PLAN, AND THE GOAL OF THAT IS

[Captioner] 19:41:28
 TO HAVE QUALIFIED MEASURES WITHIN THE CLIMATE ACTION

[Captioner] 19:41:31
 PLAN THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN SHOWN

[Captioner] 19:41:34
 AND EVALUATED FOR THEIR GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION

[Captioner] 19:41:38
 REDUCTION POTENTIAL, AND THEN AS DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS COME THROUGH

[Captioner] 19:41:41
 PLANNING, THEY CAN ALIGN WITH OR TIER OFF OF OUR CLIMATE

[Captioner] 19:41:45
 ACTION PLAN SO THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO DO THEIR OWN

[Captioner] 19:41:48
 CEQA ANALYSIS, SO IT HELPS TO STREAMLINE THAT PROCESS

[Captioner] 19:41:51
 FOR THOSE DEVELOPERS, BUT IT ALSO ENSURES THAT WE'RE SEEING

[Captioner] 19:41:54
 THE GOALS OF OUR CLIMATE ACTION PLAN BE REALIZED

[Captioner] 19:41:56
 AS NEW DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS COME THROUGH.


[Captioner] 19:42:03
IN TERMS OF THE STRUCTURE OF THE PLAN, WE HAVE A SERIES OF

[Captioner] 19:42:07
 CHAPTERS, YOU KNOW, THE SNAPSHOT IS OUR EXECUTIVE SUMMARY AND

[Captioner] 19:42:10
 CHAPTER 1 REALLY INTRODUCES THE GOALS OF THE PLAN AND THE VISION.


[Captioner] 19:42:13
AND THEN CHAPTER 2 IS THE GREEP HOUSE

[Captioner] 19:42:20
 GREENHOUSE GAS LONG

[Captioner] 19:42:23
 TERM FORECAST TO SHOW WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IN OUR COMMUNITY IF NO

[Captioner] 19:42:26
 CLIMATE ACTION WERE TO HAPPEN BY THE YEAR 2045.


[Captioner] 19:42:29
SO WE'RE LOOKING AT IF EVERYTHING THAT'S IMPLEMENTED NOW IS

[Captioner] 19:42:33
 BASED ON CURRENT STATE POLICY BUT THERE'S NO NEW STATE POLICY AND

[Captioner] 19:42:36
 THERE'S NO LOCAL ACTION TAKEN

[Captioner] 19:42:38
, WHAT WOULD EMISSIONS LOOK LIKE BY THE YEAR 2045?


[Captioner] 19:42:43
CHAPTER 3 PRESENTS THEN OUR STRATEGIES AND MEASURES FOR HOW WE CAN

[Captioner] 19:42:46
 ACHIEVE EMISSIONS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL.
SO IT'S REALLY OUR

[Captioner] 19:42:50
 MIDTERM GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION ROAD MAP

[Captioner] 19:42:53
 TO ACHIEVE OUR 2030 TARGET, WHICH IS 55% REDUCTION

[Captioner] 19:42:57
 FROM OUR 2005 BASELINE YEAR, OR A

[Captioner] 19:43:00
 30% REDUCTION FROM 2018 LEVELS, WHICH IS THE

[Captioner] 19:43:01
 BASELINE THAT WE'RE USING IN THIS PLAN.


[Captioner] 19:43:06
AND THEN CHAPTER 4 PRESENTS A SHORT-TERM

[Captioner] 19:43:09
 IMPLEMENTATION PLAN, AND IT'S REALLY FOCUSING ON WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO IN

[Captioner] 19:43:12
 THE NEXT THREE YEARS TO ACHIEVE SOME

[Captioner] 19:43:15
 PRIORITY ACTIONS THAT WE'VE IDENTIFIED

[Captioner] 19:43:19
 THROUGH DISCUSSIONS WITH STAFF AND IDENTIFICATION

[Captioner] 19:43:23
 OF OPPORTUNITIES, WITH PARTNER ORGANIZATIONS, AND

[Captioner] 19:43:26
 WHAT WE REALLY THINK THERE'S APPETITE TO DO HERE IN THE CITY OF

[Captioner] 19:43:29
 FREMONT IN THE NEXT THREE YEARS.
THERE'S

[Captioner] 19:43:33
 ALSO SOME APPENDICES ATTACHED TO THE PLAN THAT GO IN

[Captioner] 19:43:36
 DEPTH INTO THE ANALYSIS THAT WENT INTO OUR

[Captioner] 19:43:38
 GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORY AND FORECASTING.


[Captioner] 19:43:42
THERE'S THE ROBUST MEASURE LIST AND GREENHOUSE

[Captioner] 19:43:46
 GAS QUANTIFICATION MEMO, SO SOME OF THE MEASURES IN THE PLAN ARE

[Captioner] 19:43:49
 QUALIFIED FOR GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION REDUCTIONS BUT NOT ALL OF THEM, SO

[Captioner] 19:43:52
 THAT MEMO REALLY GETS INTO THE ANALYSIS FOR THOSE

[Captioner] 19:43:55
 THAT ARE ASSOCIATED DIRECTLY WITH GREENHOUSE GAS

[Captioner] 19:43:58
 EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS, AND THEN WE HAVE A THIRD APPENDICES THAT IS

[Captioner] 19:44:02
 FOCUSED -- OR APPENDIX THAT'S FOCUSED SPECIFICALLY ON OUR OWN

[Captioner] 19:44:06
 CITY OPERATIONS, AND THE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND

[Captioner] 19:44:09
 FORECASTS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT.


[Captioner] 19:44:13
IN TERMS OF THE

[Captioner] 19:44:17
 STRUCTURE OF THE MEASURES PRESENTED, WE'VE PRESENTED EIGHT

[Captioner] 19:44:20
 KIND OF KEY FOCAL AREAS IN CHAPTER 3, AND

[Captioner] 19:44:23
 THEN WITHIN EACH OF THOSE FOCAL AREAS, THERE'S A HIGH LEVEL

[Captioner] 19:44:27
 STRATEGY, AND THAT HIGH LEVEL STRATEGY HAS A NARRATIVE AROUND IT AND

[Captioner] 19:44:30
 A VISION FOR WHAT A 2045 FREMONT WOULD LOOK

[Captioner] 19:44:32
 LIKE IF THAT STRATEGY WERE TO BE ACHIEVED.


[Captioner] 19:44:35
AND THEN WITHIN THAT STRATEGY, THERE'S A SERIES OF

[Captioner] 19:44:39
 MEASURES, AND AT THE MEASURE LEVEL, THAT'S WHERE WE'RE DOING A

[Captioner] 19:44:42
 GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION CALCULATION

[Captioner] 19:44:45
.
SO FOR ANY OF THE QUANTIFIED MEASURES 

[Captioner] 19:44:48
THAT WOULD BE CEQA STREAMLINED FOR PROJECT

[Captioner] 19:44:50
 TIERING, THAT'S WHERE THAT ANALYSIS LEVEL IS COMING IN.


[Captioner] 19:44:54
THEN THE ACTIONS ARE SPECIFIC WAYS THAT WE

[Captioner] 19:44:57
 CAN ACHIEVE THE MEASURE.
SO SOME OF THOSE

[Captioner] 19:45:00
 ACTIONS ARE GOING TO BE MORE POLICY-ORIENTED, SOME

[Captioner] 19:45:03
 OF THOSE ACTIONS MAY BE FOCUSED MORE ON

[Captioner] 19:45:07
 COLLABORATIONS WITH COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS

[Captioner] 19:45:11
, THEY COULD BE IMPLEMENTATION OF PROGRAMS THAT WE'RE DOING IN 

[Captioner] 19:45:14
PARTNERSHIP WITH REGIONAL AGENCIES, AND THERE'S

[Captioner] 19:45:17
 ALSO BOTH GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION MEASURES AS WELL AS

[Captioner] 19:45:20
 ADAPTATION RESILIENCY MEASURES.


[Captioner] 19:45:25
THEY'RE ACTIONS.
IN TERMS

[Captioner] 19:45:28
 OF THE CO-BENEFITS OF THE PLAN, ON TOP OF THE GREENHOUSE

[Captioner] 19:45:31
 GAS EMISSION REDUCTIONS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE, THERE'S A NUMBER

[Captioner] 19:45:35
 OF SIGNIFICANT CO-BENEFITS, AND SO WHAT WE DID AT THE

[Captioner] 19:45:38
 MEASURE LEVEL IS IDENTIFY THOSE

[Captioner] 19:45:40
 CO-BENEFITS WITH AN ICON YOU CAN SEE HERE.


[Captioner] 19:45:43
SO WE'RE LOOKING AT, YOU KNOW, EQUITY, AIR POLLUTION

[Captioner] 19:45:46
 PREVENTION, HEALTH AND WELL-BEING, INFRASTRUCTURE

[Captioner] 19:45:51
 RELIABILITY, COMMUNITY RESILIENCE, A LOCAL ECONOMIC IMPACT,

[Captioner] 19:45:54
 AND RESOURCE PRESERVATION.


[Captioner] 19:45:59
ALL RIGHT.
SO IN TERMS OF THE GAME PLAN, WHICH IS

[Captioner] 19:46:03
 REALLY WHERE WE WANTED TO FOCUS TONIGHT, THAT'S

[Captioner] 19:46:06
 THE THREE-YEAR IMPLEMENTATION

[Captioner] 19:46:09
 PLAN, WE HAVE A NUMBER OF COMMUNITY

[Captioner] 19:46:12
 LEVEL ACTIONS AS WELL AS CITY MUNICIPAL ACTIONS

[Captioner] 19:46:16
 IN THAT PLAN.
SO THE COMMUNITY

[Captioner] 19:46:19
 LEVEL ACTIONS THAT ARE WITHIN THE GAME

[Captioner] 19:46:22
 PLAN INCLUDE OPTING UP ALL OF OUR RESIDENTS AND

[Captioner] 19:46:25
 BUSINESSES TO EAST BAY COMMUNITY ENERGY'S RENEWABLE 100 RATE

[Captioner] 19:46:28
 PLAN, WHICH IS 100% GREENHOUSE

[Captioner] 19:46:31
 GAS-FREE POWER MADE FROM CALIFORNIA-BASED WIND AND SOLAR.


[Captioner] 19:46:35
AND SO THAT WOULD REQUIRE COUNCIL

[Captioner] 19:46:38
 ACTION.
ABOUT HALF OF THE CITIES WITHIN

[Captioner] 19:46:41
 EAST BAY COMMUNITY'S TERRITORY HAVE ALREADY DOB THAT FOR

[Captioner] 19:46:44
 DONE THAT FOR RESIDENTS AND BUSINESSES.


[Captioner] 19:46:47
REQUIRING NEW RESIDENTIAL AND NON-RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENTS TO BE AT 

[Captioner] 19:46:51
THE SIGNED AS ALL ELECTRIC, SO ELIMINATING NATURAL GAS OR

[Captioner] 19:46:54
 FOSSIL FUELS FROM THOSE DEVELOPMENTS.
PARTNERING

[Captioner] 19:46:57
 WITH EAST BAY COMMUNITY ENERGY TO INSTALL

[Captioner] 19:47:00
 PUBLIC-FACING DC FAST CHARGING ELECTRIC VEHICLE HUBS, AND THAT'S 

[Captioner] 19:47:03
ACTUALLY AN EFFORT THAT'S UNDERWAY AT THE STAFF LEVEL, WE'VE BEEN

[Captioner] 19:47:06
 HAVING CONVERSATIONS WITH EAST BAY COMMUNITY ENERGY TO

[Captioner] 19:47:10
 IDENTIFY WHERE WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO INSTALL THESE D.C.  FAST

[Captioner] 19:47:13
 CHARGING HUBS ON CITY PROPERTY.
TO CONTINUE

[Captioner] 19:47:16
 IMPLEMENTING THE MOBILITY ACTION PLAN AND

[Captioner] 19:47:19
 SPECIFICALLY FOCUSING ON MODE SHIFT AND TRAFFIC

[Captioner] 19:47:23
 SIGNAL MODERNIZATION, AND TO CONTINUE IMPLEMENTING OUR ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION

[Captioner] 19:47:26
 OPTIONS, ESPECIALLY WITH A FOCUS ON SAFE ROUTES TO SCHOOL,

[Captioner] 19:47:29
 AND AS YOU KNOW THE ACTIVE -- WE'RE IN

[Captioner] 19:47:32
 THE PROCESS DEVELOPING AN ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION PLAN THAT WILL

[Captioner] 19:47:35
 REPLACE THE BIKE AND PEDESTRIAN MASTER PLANS.


[Captioner] 19:47:39
EVALUATING A MODEL PLASTIC

[Captioner] 19:47:43
 WASTE/RE-USE ORDINANCE THAT IS CURRENTLY BEING DEVELOPED BY STOPWASTE 

[Captioner] 19:47:47
AT THE COUNTY LEVEL FOR CITIES TO ADOPT AT A

[Captioner] 19:47:50
 LOCAL LEVEL.
DEVELOPING

[Captioner] 19:47:53
 AN OUTREACH AND ENFORCEMENT IMPLEMENTATION PLAN FOR

[Captioner] 19:47:57
 OUR ORGANIC WASTE AND SB1383,

[Captioner] 19:48:00
 WHICH IS FOOD WASTE EFFORTS.


[Captioner] 19:48:05
ADOPTING THE URBAN

[Captioner] 19:48:10
 FORESTRY MANAGEMENT PLAN WHICH WE'VE ALREADY DONE AND BEGINNING

[Captioner] 19:48:13
 TO PLANT 800 TREES ANNUALLY WHICH WILL HELP WITH

[Captioner] 19:48:17
 OUR CARBON SEQUESTRATION EFFORTS.
COLLABORATING WITH INDUSTRY

[Captioner] 19:48:21
 PARTNERS TO HOST GREEN BUSINESS BEST

[Captioner] 19:48:24
 PRACTICES AND EVENTS/FORUMS.
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT OUR ECONOMIC

[Captioner] 19:48:27
 DEVELOPMENT DIVISION AND I HAVE TALKED ABOUT AND HOPE TO DO ACTUALLY PRIOR TO 

[Captioner] 19:48:31
THE PANDEMIC AND ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO GOING

[Captioner] 19:48:35
 BACK TO SHORTLY.
COLLABORATING WITH THE

[Captioner] 19:48:38
 SCHOOL DISTRICT AND COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATIONS

[Captioner] 19:48:41
 TO EXPAND PARTICIPATION IN THE FREMONT GREEN CHALLENGE, WHICH IS OUR

[Captioner] 19:48:44
 RESIDENTIAL CLIMATE ACTION ENGAGEMENT PLATFORM THAT WE LAUNCHED

[Captioner] 19:48:47
 BACK IN 2016.
AND THEN TO LAUNCH A

[Captioner] 19:48:51
 CLIMATE READY FREMONT PUBLIC FACING ONLINE TRACKING AND REPORTING

[Captioner] 19:48:54
 DASHBOARD, WHERE WE WOULD BE ABLE TO

[Captioner] 19:48:58
 PUT IN INFORMATION ABOUT OUR IMPLEMENTATION EFFORTS

[Captioner] 19:49:02
 AND HAVE DIFFERENT REPORTS AND VISUALS

[Captioner] 19:49:06
 SHOWING HOW MUCH WE ARE ON TRACK IN MEETING OUR

[Captioner] 19:49:10
 GOALS.


[Captioner] 19:49:14
AT THE CITY LEVEL, CITY OPERATIONAL LEVEL, YOU KNOW, THERE'S

[Captioner] 19:49:17
 A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT HAVE ACTUALLY ALREADY BEEN IMPLEMENTED OR ARE

[Captioner] 19:49:20
 UNDERWAY.
SO OPTING UP OUR CITY ACCOUNTS TO EAST

[Captioner] 19:49:23
 BAY COMMUNITY ENERGY'S RENEWABLE 100 RATE PLAN.


[Captioner] 19:49:26
WE DID THAT LAST YEAR.
ESTABLISHING AN

[Captioner] 19:49:30
 ALL-ELECTRIC OR ZERO NET ENERGY DESIGN REQUIREMENT FOR OUR

[Captioner] 19:49:33
 OWN CITY FACILITIES.
SOMETHING THAT, YOU

[Captioner] 19:49:36
 KNOW, WE'VE BEEN DOING IN PRACTICE BUT WE DON'T HAVE

[Captioner] 19:49:40
 A POLICY AROUND.
OUR DOWNTOWN

[Captioner] 19:49:43
 EVENT CENTER WAS DESIGNED AS ALL ELECTRIC AND HAS SOLAR ON

[Captioner] 19:49:47
 SITE.
REPLACING OUR EXISTING GAS POWERED

[Captioner] 19:49:49
 HVAC SYSTEMS WITH ELECTRIC HEAT PUMPS WHERE FEASIBLE.


[Captioner] 19:49:52
SO IN THE CIP THAT WAS ADOPTED LAST WEEK, WE HAVE

[Captioner] 19:49:55
 FUNDING FOR HVAC UPGRADES AND THE INTENTION IS

[Captioner] 19:49:58
 TO REPLACE THOSE WITH HEAT PUMPS WHEREVER POSSIBLE.


[Captioner] 19:50:03
PARTNERING WITH EAST BAY COMMUNITY ENERGY TO INSTALL RENEWABLE

[Captioner] 19:50:05
 MICROGRIDS ON CRITICAL CITY FACILITIES.


[Captioner] 19:50:09
THIS IS ANOTHER EVIDENT

[Captioner] 19:50:12
 EFFORT THE COUNCIL WEIGHED IN ON A COUPLE

[Captioner] 19:50:15
 YEARS AGO WHERE WE GAVE EAST BAY COMMUNITY ENERGY PERMISSION TO

[Captioner] 19:50:18
 MOVE FORWARD IN PUTTING OUT A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS AND

[Captioner] 19:50:22
 IDENTIFYING WHERE WE MAY HAVE OPPORTUNITIES TO INSTALL

[Captioner] 19:50:25
 SOLAR AND BATTERY STORAGE ON CITY FACILITIES,

[Captioner] 19:50:29
 SO THERE'S EIGHT FACILITIES THAT ARE POTENTIALLY PART OF THAT PROJECT

[Captioner] 19:50:32
 AND WE'RE WAITING TO HEAR BACK FROM EAST BAY COMMUNITY ENERGY

[Captioner] 19:50:35
 ANY MINUTE NOW ON WHAT THOSE PROPOSALS LOOK LIKE,

[Captioner] 19:50:37
 AND THEN WE'LL BE COMING BACK TO COUNCIL WITH THAT PROJECT.


[Captioner] 19:50:42
REPLACING OUR CITY FLEET VEHICLES WITH ELECTRIC VEHICLES

[Captioner] 19:50:46
 AND INSTALLING SUPPORTING EV CHARGING

[Captioner] 19:50:48
 INFRASTRUCTURE.
THAT WAS ANOTHER EFFORT THAT WAS 

[Captioner] 19:50:52
FUNDED UNDER THE CIP, SO WE'RE NOW LOOKING AT HOW CAN

[Captioner] 19:50:55
 WE UPGRADE OUR ELECTRICAL INFRASTRUCTURE TO REALLY SUPPORT A

[Captioner] 19:50:59
 ROBUST CONVERSION OF OUR CITY FLEET VEHICLES TO

[Captioner] 19:51:03
 ELECTRIC.
WE'VE IMPLEMENTED A CITY

[Captioner] 19:51:06
 HYBRID TELEWORK POLICY FOR EMPLOYEES, AND ARE WORKING ON

[Captioner] 19:51:09
 ADOPTING THAT, SO THAT'S ALLOWING OUR EMPLOYEE COMMUTE TO

[Captioner] 19:51:12
 ACTUALLY REDUCE OUR CARBON IMPACT SIGNIFICANTLY BECAUSE

[Captioner] 19:51:16
 EMPLOYEES CAN TELEWORK MULTIPLE DAYS A

[Captioner] 19:51:19
 WEEK.
EXPANDING INTEGRATION OF A

[Captioner] 19:51:21
 REUSABLE FOOD WARE OPTIONS AT CITY FACILITIES.


[Captioner] 19:51:25
WE'VE DONE A PILOT AT THE AQUA ADVENTURE WATER PARK AND ARE

[Captioner] 19:51:27
 EVALUATING THE RESULTS OF THAT RIGHT NOW.


[Captioner] 19:51:31
APPLYING COMPOST AND MULCH TO CITY LANDSCAPES IN

[Captioner] 19:51:34
 ALIGNMENT WITH THE GOALS OF SB1383, SO

[Captioner] 19:51:37
 WE ACTUALLY UPDATED OUR

[Captioner] 19:51:41
 ENVIRONMENTALLY PREFERABLE PURCHASING POLICY IN THE

[Captioner] 19:51:44
 LAST YEAR TO ENSURE THAT INTEGRATION

[Captioner] 19:51:48
 OF THE GOALS WITHIN SB1383

[Captioner] 19:51:51
 REGARDING APPLICATION OF MULCH TO CITY LANDSCAPES HAS BEEN

[Captioner] 19:51:54
 PART OF OUR PURCHASING POLICY.
AND THEN

[Captioner] 19:51:58
 FINALLY, CERTIFYING ANY CITY FACILITIES AS CALIFORNIA GREEN

[Captioner] 19:52:02
 BUSINESSES WHERE WE MIGHT HAVE THAT

[Captioner] 19:52:06
 OPPORTUNITY, WE'VE IDENTIFIED IN THE PAST THAT WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO THAT

[Captioner] 19:52:07
 POTENTIALLY STARTING WITH OUR FIRE STATIONS.


[Captioner] 19:52:11
AND THEN ESTABLISHING AN INTERDEPARTMENTAL GREEN

[Captioner] 19:52:15
 PURCHASING TRAINING AND CHAMPIONS PROGRAM TO HELP

[Captioner] 19:52:18
 WITH IMPLEMENTATION OF THAT ENVIRONMENTALLY

[Captioner] 19:52:19
 PREFERABLE PURCHASING POLICY THAT I MENTIONED.


[Captioner] 19:52:27
THERE'S SOME OTHER NOTEWORTHY ACTIONS I WANTED TO MENTION WITHIN THE

[Captioner] 19:52:29
 PLAN ITSELF THAT DO HAVE POLICY IMPLICATIONS.


[Captioner] 19:52:32
THESE ARE NOT WITHIN THE GAME PLAN, BUT THESE ARE THINGS THAT

[Captioner] 19:52:35
 WE MIGHT BE CONSIDERING LONGER

[Captioner] 19:52:38
 TERM OR COULD COME UP IN THE SHORTER TERM IF

[Captioner] 19:52:42
 THERE ARE -- IF THERE'S MOMENTUM

[Captioner] 19:52:45
 BEHIND THEM FROM THE COMMUNITY OR FROM COUNCIL OR IF

[Captioner] 19:52:48
 THERE'S A STATE LEVEL ACTION THAT PROVOKES IT.


[Captioner] 19:52:52
SO ONE OF THOSE IS TO THINK ABOUT A FINAL

[Captioner] 19:52:55
 PHASEOUT DATE FOR NON-INDUSTRIAL

[Captioner] 19:52:58
 METHANE GAS PROCUREMENT, SO THAT MEANS NATURAL GAS PROCUREMENT.


[Captioner] 19:53:03
ANOTHER IS TO CONSIDER AN ORDINANCE THAT MIGHT

[Captioner] 19:53:07
 PROHIBIT THE INSTALLATION OF NEW GASOLINE SERVICE

[Captioner] 19:53:11
 STATIONS.
THE CITY OF PETALUMA WAS THE FIRST TO 

[Captioner] 19:53:14
DO THAT BACK IN 2021 AND SINCE THEN, ABOUT A HANDFUL OF NORTH BAY

[Captioner] 19:53:17
 CITIES HAVE DONE THE SAME.


[Captioner] 19:53:20
CONSIDERING AN ORDINANCE BANNING THE USE OF GAS POWERED LANDSCAPING

[Captioner] 19:53:23
 EQUIPMENT.
A NUMBER OF CITIES HAVE DONE THIS AS 

[Captioner] 19:53:26
WELL.
SOME OF THEM HAVE DONE IT FROM A NOISE 

[Captioner] 19:53:30
ORDINANCE PERSPECTIVE.
IN FREMONT, WE

[Captioner] 19:53:33
 HAVE NOT DISCUSSED THIS IN DEPTH WITH COUNCIL,

[Captioner] 19:53:37
 BUT THERE'S ALSO A STATE LEVEL

[Captioner] 19:53:41
 POLICY THAT HAS BEEN PUT IN PLACE SO

[Captioner] 19:53:44
 THAT THE SALE OF LANDSCAPING EQUIPMENT STARTING

[Captioner] 19:53:48
 IN 2024 WILL NO LONGER BE GAS, IT WILL BE ELECTRIC, SO THERE

[Captioner] 19:53:52
 WILL BE -- FROM A KIND

[Captioner] 19:53:55
 OF CONSUMER PERSPECTIVE, THERE WILL ONLY BE AN OPTION TO

[Captioner] 19:53:59
 PURCHASE ELECTRIC EQUIPMENT MOVING FORWARD, BUT ANY

[Captioner] 19:54:02
 GAS EQUIPMENT THAT'S STILL OUT THERE COULD BE USED UNLESS

[Captioner] 19:54:05
 THERE WAS A LOCAL BAN.
REMOVING PARKING MINIMUMS FOR

[Captioner] 19:54:07
 NEW DEVELOPMENTS WITHIN HALF A MILE OF TRANSIT.


[Captioner] 19:54:12
SO THIS COULD REALLY

[Captioner] 19:54:16
 RESULT IN A MORE

[Captioner] 19:54:19
 URBANIZED AREA AND THINKING ABOUT HOW CAN WE

[Captioner] 19:54:22
 REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE DRIVING

[Captioner] 19:54:25
 WITHIN THOSE AREAS WHERE WE DO HAVE THE USE OF PUBLIC

[Captioner] 19:54:29
 TRANSIT AVAILABLE.
ANOTHER IS EXPLORING THE

[Captioner] 19:54:32
 PHASING IN OF A METHANE GAS USE

[Captioner] 19:54:36
 TAX, SO

[Captioner] 19:54:39
 UNTIL WE WERE TO BAN METHANE GAS, WE CAN THINK ABOUT TAXING

[Captioner] 19:54:42
 THE USE OF IT AND THAT COULD THEN GO TOWARD A FUND

[Captioner] 19:54:45
 TO HELP WITH ELECTRIFICATION EFFORTS.


[Captioner] 19:54:49
PRIORITIZING GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION AND RESILIENCY EFFORTS

[Captioner] 19:54:52
 THROUGH THE CITY BUDGETARY PROCESS, AND THEN ALSO PROVIDING CIP

[Captioner] 19:54:55
 FUNDING FOR CLIMATE INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS.


[Captioner] 19:54:58
SO WE HAVE JUST IN THIS LAST CIP

[Captioner] 19:55:02
 CYCLE PUT FUNDING TOWARD CLIMATE INFRASTRUCTURE

[Captioner] 19:55:05
 PROJECTS, AND THAT'S REALLY THE FIRST TIME WE'VE DONE THAT IN A

[Captioner] 19:55:08
 VERY SUBSTANTIAL WAY, SO I'M

[Captioner] 19:55:11
 EXCITED TO SEE OUR ABILITY TO DO THIS

[Captioner] 19:55:15
 IN A MORE IN DEPTH WAY, AND WE CAN ALSO THINK ABOUT HOW

[Captioner] 19:55:18
 WE CAN PRIORITIZE RESILIENCY IN THE

[Captioner] 19:55:21
 SAME WAY.


[Captioner] 19:55:24
IN TERMS OF THE TIMELINE, YOU

[Captioner] 19:55:27
 KNOW, THROUGH THE LAST COUPLE MONTHS, WE WERE PREPARING

[Captioner] 19:55:30
 A FINAL DRAFT AND REVIEWING IT WITH

[Captioner] 19:55:34
 CITY LEADERSHIP, AND THEN ON JUNE 1ST, WE BROUGHT

[Captioner] 19:55:37
 THE DRAFT PLAN TO OUR ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY COMMISSION.


[Captioner] 19:55:40
THEY GAVE US SOME FEEDBACK WHICH WAS ATTACHED

[Captioner] 19:55:43
 TO THE STAFF

[Captioner] 19:55:47
 REPORT IN SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDED THAT THE DRAFT PLAN COME

[Captioner] 19:55:50
 TO COUNCIL AND BE OPENED UP FOR A

[Captioner] 19:55:53
 PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD.


[Captioner] 19:55:57
SO THE GOAL IS THEN IF COUNCIL DECIDES TO OPEN IT

[Captioner] 19:56:00
 UP TO PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD, WE WOULD HAVE THAT PUBLIC COMMENT

[Captioner] 19:56:03
 PERIOD OPEN FOR THE REMAINDER OF JUNE

[Captioner] 19:56:06
 AND THROUGH JULY, AND IT WOULD BE A TOPIC

[Captioner] 19:56:11
 ON MYFREMONT, AND THEN BY LATE SUMMER/EARLY FALL

[Captioner] 19:56:14
 AS WE HAVE TIME TO TAKE IN THE COMMENTS FROM

[Captioner] 19:56:18
 THE COMMISSION AND FROM COUNCIL AND FROM THE PUBLIC, REVISE THE

[Captioner] 19:56:21
 PLAN AND THEN BRING IT BACK TO THE

[Captioner] 19:56:23
 SUSTAINABILITY COMMISSION AND THEN TO COUNCIL FOR FINAL ADOPTION.


[Captioner] 19:56:31
SO WITH THAT, WE'RE LOOKING FOR FEEDBACK

[Captioner] 19:56:34
 FROM COUNCIL, HIGH LEVEL THOUGHTS ON THE CONTENT, THE ORGANIZATION,

[Captioner] 19:56:38
 THE PRESENTATION OF THE PLAN.
ANY SPECIFIC COMMENTS YOU MIGHT

[Captioner] 19:56:42
 HAVE ON THE GAME PLAN, WHICH, AGAIN, IS THAT THREE-YEAR KIND OF

[Captioner] 19:56:45
 FOCUSED IMPLEMENTATION PLAN.
AND THEN ANY QUESTIONS OR

[Captioner] 19:56:48
 CONCERNS YOU MIGHT HAVE WITH SOME OF THE STRATEGIES,

[Captioner] 19:56:51
 MEASURES OR ACTIONS PRESENTED, AND WE'RE

[Captioner] 19:56:54
 HAPPY TO ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS,

[Captioner] 19:56:57
 NOTE ANY COMMENTS THAT YOU HAVE, AND

[Captioner] 19:57:01
 INCORPORATE THAT INTO THE NEXT VERSION OF THE PLAN THAT WE'LL

[Captioner] 19:57:04
 BRING BACK TO YOU.


[Captioner] 19:57:09
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU FOR THE THOROUGH PRESENTATION.


[Captioner] 19:57:12
AND AT THIS TIME, I'D LIKE TO OPEN IT UP TO THE COUNCIL FOR

[Captioner] 19:57:15
 CLARIFYING QUESTIONS.


[Captioner] 19:57:17
COUNCILMEMBER SHAO, PLEASE.
>> Councilmember Shao: THANK YOU, 

[Captioner] 19:57:21
MADAME MAYOR.
THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION.


[Captioner] 19:57:24
THROUGHOUT THE PRESENTATION, I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR ONE WORD

[Captioner] 19:57:28
 OR ONE BRAND, WHICH IS TESLA

[Captioner] 19:57:31
.
BECAUSE TESLA ADMITS, YOU KNOW, THAT

[Captioner] 19:57:35
 EVEN THOUGH THEIR ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT

[Captioner] 19:57:38
 IN 2021

[Captioner] 19:57:42
 BRAGS THAT THE WORLDWIDE

[Captioner] 19:57:45
 SAVING OF GREENHOUSE GAS

[Captioner] 19:57:50
 EMISSION COMES TO

[Captioner] 19:57:53
 6.5 MILLION METRIC TONS OF CARBON DIOXIDE

[Captioner] 19:57:57
 BY SIMPLY DRIVING THE ELECTRIC CARS

[Captioner] 19:58:00
 INSTEAD OF THE GAS-DRIVEN CARS,

[Captioner] 19:58:03
 THEIR OPERATION AND THEIR

[Captioner] 19:58:06
 SUPPLY CHAIN GREENHOUSE CARBON DIOXIDE

[Captioner] 19:58:09
 EMISSION ACTUALLY TOTALS

[Captioner] 19:58:14
 ABOUT 33 MILLION METRIC TONS

[Captioner] 19:58:17
 OF CARBON DIOXIDE, WHICH IS ABOUT

[Captioner] 19:58:20
 5 TIMES WHAT THEY CLAIM THAT THEY HAVE SAVED.


[Captioner] 19:58:24
SO CONSIDERING THAT THEY ARE THE

[Captioner] 19:58:28
 BIGGEST EMPLOYER IN THE CITY AND

[Captioner] 19:58:31
 ALSO PROBABLY THE LARG

[Captioner] 19:58:35
EST OPERATION IN TERMS

[Captioner] 19:58:38
 OF MANUFACTURING IN FREMONT, ALSO

[Captioner] 19:58:41
 CONSIDERING THAT RECENTLY THEY ARE ADDING A NEW

[Captioner] 19:58:45
 BATTERY

[Captioner] 19:58:49
 MANUFACTURING FACILITY IN

[Captioner] 19:58:52
 FREMONT, THE QUESTION IS, HOW DO

[Captioner] 19:58:55
 WE MEASURE

[Captioner] 19:58:58
 THEIR CARBON DIOXIDE

[Captioner] 19:59:03
 FOR PAINT, CONSIDERING IT'S ACTUALLY

[Captioner] 19:59:07
 ADDING THE CITY-WIDE CARBON

[Captioner] 19:59:11
 DIOXIDE EMISSION RATHER THAN REDUCING

[Captioner] 19:59:14
 THE EMISSION.
SO CAN YOU ADDRESS

[Captioner] 19:59:18
 THAT?
>> SO WHEN WE DO OUR GREENHOUSE GAS

[Captioner] 19:59:21
 EMISSIONS INVENTORY ACCOUNTING, WE ARE LOOKING AT EMISSIONS

[Captioner] 19:59:25
 ASSOCIATED WITH MANUFACTURING THAT'S HAPPENING IN OUR

[Captioner] 19:59:28
 COMMUNITY, IN TERMS OF WHAT WE CAN CAPTURE FROM ELECTRIC

[Captioner] 19:59:31
 AND GAS USAGE, AND THEN WE'RE ALSO LOOKING

[Captioner] 19:59:34
 AT TRANSPORTATION, SO TRIPS THAT ARE STARTING OR ENDING IN FREMONT WILL

[Captioner] 19:59:38
 CAPTURE HALF OF THE EMISSIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT TRIP AND THEN 

[Captioner] 19:59:41
WHERE THEY END OR START, YOU KNOW, THAT COMMUNITY IS ALSO

[Captioner] 19:59:44
 CAPTURING HALF.
SO IN TERMS OF THE OTHER

[Captioner] 19:59:48
 EMISSIONS ASSOCIATED WITH TESLA'S GLOBAL

[Captioner] 19:59:51
 OPERATIONS, WE'RE NOT SEEING THOSE EMISSIONS IN OUR ACCOUNTING AND WE 

[Captioner] 19:59:55
DON'T REALLY HAVE CONTROL OVER IT.
I WILL SAY,

[Captioner] 19:59:59
 WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE WHEN IT COMES

[Captioner] 20:00:02
 TO LOOKING AT, YOU KNOW, THE IMPACT

[Captioner] 20:00:06
 OF INDUSTRY AND MANUFACTURING IN OUR COMMUNITY VERSUS, YOU KNOW,

[Captioner] 20:00:09
 WHAT THE PRODUCTS THAT ARE BEING MADE CAN

[Captioner] 20:00:12
 DO FOR THE GLOBAL COMMUNITY.
SO IN THE CASE OF

[Captioner] 20:00:16
 TESLA, YOU KNOW, THEY ARE USING ELECTRICITY AND GAS FOR

[Captioner] 20:00:19
 THEIR MANUFACTURING IN A SUBSTANTIAL

[Captioner] 20:00:22
 WAY.
THE VEHICLES THAT THEY'RE PRODUCING, 

[Captioner] 20:00:25
YOU KNOW, IF THAT ELECTRICITY

[Captioner] 20:00:29
 BEING SUPPLIED TO THOSE VEHICLES

[Captioner] 20:00:32
 ARE RENEWABLE THEN THOSE VEHICLES ARE RUNNING 100% CLEAN.


[Captioner] 20:00:35
SO WE DO HAVE A LOT OF CLEANTECH INDUSTRY IN

[Captioner] 20:00:38
 FREMONT, AND WE'RE LOOKING AT, YOU KNOW, HOW DO WE SUPPORT

[Captioner] 20:00:41
 THE DEVELOPMENT OF THESE CLEANTECH BUSINESSES

[Captioner] 20:00:45
, ALLOW THEM TO CONTINUE TO GROW AND OPERATE, BUT ALSO,

[Captioner] 20:00:48
 YOU KNOW, RECOGNIZE THAT AT THE SAME TIME, THERE NEEDS TO

[Captioner] 20:00:52
 BE A TAPERING OFF OF FOSSIL

[Captioner] 20:00:54
 FUEL CONSUMPTION ASSOCIATED WITH THAT MANUFACTURING, SO SOME OF THE MEASURES 

[Captioner] 20:00:58
YOU'LL SEE IN THE PLAN, WHERE WE'RE LOOKING AT THE COMMERCIAL

[Captioner] 20:01:01
 SECTOR, THE NON-RESIDENTIAL SECTOR, WE DO MAKE

[Captioner] 20:01:04
 PROVISIONS FOR CORE INDUSTRIAL

[Captioner] 20:01:08
 OPERATIONS BECAUSE AT THIS TIME, YOU KNOW,

[Captioner] 20:01:11
 THERE ARE NOT NECESSARILY

[Captioner] 20:01:15
 EASY REPLACEMENTS FOR USING GAS IN THE

[Captioner] 20:01:18
 PRODUCTION OF SOME OF THE EQUIPMENT BEING MADE HERE.


[Captioner] 20:01:23
BUT LONG TERM, YES, THAT IS THE GOAL

[Captioner] 20:01:26
.
AND IT IS CHALLENGING, ALSO, TO BE

[Captioner] 20:01:29
 ABLE TO GET INSIGHT SOMETIMES ON ALL OF THE

[Captioner] 20:01:33
 MISSIONS ASSOCIATED WITH A COMPANY LIKE TESLA, WHO, YOU KNOW, MAY

[Captioner] 20:01:36
 ALSO KEEP SOME INDUSTRY SECRETS.
>> Councilmember Shao: THANK YOU VERY

[Captioner] 20:01:39
 MUCH.
YOU KNOW, TOO BAD

[Captioner] 20:01:42
 YOU HAVEN'T

[Captioner] 20:01:46
 ENENACTED ANY LAW TO LEVY A CARBON

[Captioner] 20:01:49
 TAX UNLIKE SOME EUROPEAN COUNTRIES.
OTHERWISE

[Captioner] 20:01:52
 JUST BY THE AMOUNT OF TAX THEY PAY, THAT CAN

[Captioner] 20:01:56
 CALCULATE HOW MUCH CARBON FOOTPRINT THEY GENERATED EVERY YEAR.


[Captioner] 20:02:04
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
CLARIFYING QUESTIONS, COUNCILMEMBER 

[Captioner] 20:02:09
SALWAN.
>> Councilmember Salwan: THANK YOU, 

[Captioner] 20:02:11
MADAME MAYOR, AND THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION.


[Captioner] 20:02:14
YOU MENTIONED THE SCHOOLS, AND IN THE PAST, THE SCHOOLS

[Captioner] 20:02:17
 HAVE BEEN THE LARGEST GENERATOR OF GREENHOUSE

[Captioner] 20:02:20
 GASES.
HOW DO WE GET THEM

[Captioner] 20:02:23
 INVOLVED TO REDUCE THEIR CARBON FOOTPRINT?


[Captioner] 20:02:26
>> YEAH, SO THE SCHOOL DISTRICT HAS, YOU KNOW, BEEN

[Captioner] 20:02:29
 DOING A LOT IN TERMS OF TRYING TO IMPROVE THEIR OWN OPERATIONS.


[Captioner] 20:02:33
OBVIOUSLY WE DON'T HAVE AS MUCH CONTROL OVER WHAT

[Captioner] 20:02:36
 THEY DO WITH THEIR OPERATIONS, BUT IN TERMS OF

[Captioner] 20:02:40
 ENERGY CONSUMPTION, YOU KNOW, I'M AWARE THAT THERE ARE EFFORTS

[Captioner] 20:02:43
 UNDERWAY TO GET SOLAR AND BATTERY ON A NUMBER OF SCHOOL SITES.


[Captioner] 20:02:47
THERE'S ALSO ELECTRIFICATION OF THE SCHOOL

[Captioner] 20:02:50
 DISTRICT'S BUS FLEET, AND THEN

[Captioner] 20:02:53
 ON THE SIDE OF

[Captioner] 20:02:56
 THE STUDENTS AND CURRICULUM, THERE'S SOME REALLY SUBSTANTIAL EFFORTS 

[Captioner] 20:02:59
UNDERWAY, SO CLEAN, THE CLIMATE LITERACY, ENVIRONMENTAL

[Captioner] 20:03:02
 EDUCATION NETWORK WAS ESTABLISHED TWO YEARS

[Captioner] 20:03:05
 AGO AFTER THE FREMONT UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT

[Captioner] 20:03:09
 ADOPTED A POLICY THAT WAS ACTUALLY BROUGHT TO

[Captioner] 20:03:12
 THEM BY STUDENTS FOR CLIMATE LITERACY TO ENSURE

[Captioner] 20:03:16
 THAT ALL STUDENTS WOULD BE GRADUATED AS

[Captioner] 20:03:19
 CLIMATE-LITERATE.
SO NOW THIS EFFORT, THE CLEAN

[Captioner] 20:03:22
 EFFORT IS KIND OF A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN STUDENTS

[Captioner] 20:03:25
 AND THE STAFF, AND

[Captioner] 20:03:28
 TEACHERS TO IDENTIFY

[Captioner] 20:03:32
 WHERE CURRICULUM CAN BE DEVELOPED AND ENHANCED TO FOCUS

[Captioner] 20:03:35
 ON CLIMATE EDUCATION AND IMPROVE THE STUDENTS' CLIMATE

[Captioner] 20:03:39
 LITERACY, AS WELL AS BRING IN PROGRAMMING THAT, YOU

[Captioner] 20:03:42
 KNOW, IS RELATED TO

[Captioner] 20:03:43
 COMMUNITY-WIDE CLIMATE ACTION EFFORTS.


[Captioner] 20:03:47
AND SO I'VE BEEN WORKING CLOSELY WITH

[Captioner] 20:03:50
 STUDENTS AND STAFF, NATE

[Captioner] 20:03:53
 IVY IS ONE OF OUR SUSTAINABILITY COMMISSIONERS AND HE'S LEADING

[Captioner] 20:03:57
 THE CLEAN EFFORT TO REALLY LOOK AT WHAT ARE

[Captioner] 20:04:00
 SOME OF THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE CAN PROVIDE AS THE

[Captioner] 20:04:03
 CITY TO ENGAGE STUDENTS IN, YOU

[Captioner] 20:04:06
 KNOW, PROGRAMS AND EFFORTS THAT ARE HAPPENING IN

[Captioner] 20:04:09
 THE COMMUNITY, AND THE STUDENTS, YOU KNOW, ARE ALSO VERY

[Captioner] 20:04:13
 STRONG ADVOCATES TO THE BOARD ITSELF IN TERMS OF

[Captioner] 20:04:16
 PUSHING FOR THE SCHOOL DISTRICT TO IMPROVE ITS

[Captioner] 20:04:20
 OWN ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT.


[Captioner] 20:04:23
DO YOU WANT TO ADD?
>> I WOULD JUST ADD, COUNCILMEMBER

[Captioner] 20:04:26
 SALWAN, THAT ON THE SUSTAINABILITY COMMISSION, WE HAVE

[Captioner] 20:04:29
 ONE SEAT THAT'S SET ASIDE FOR A REPRESENTATIVE

[Captioner] 20:04:33
 FROM FREMONT UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT AND THAT'S

[Captioner] 20:04:36
 NATE IVY THAT RACHEL MENTIONED.
WE ALSO HAVE

[Captioner] 20:04:39
 A STUDENT COMMISSIONER, SO THAT IS A GOOD OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO HAVE 

[Captioner] 20:04:42
LIAISONS WITH THE SCHOOL DISTRICT AND SORT OF A GOOD WAY TO FOSTER

[Captioner] 20:04:45
 COLLABORATION.
>> Councilmember

[Captioner] 20:04:48
 Salwan: THANK YOU.
SO IN THIS 2045 PLAN, LIKE WHAT ARE

[Captioner] 20:04:51
 THE BIG THINGS THAT WE'RE GOING TO TACKLE SO THAT WE

[Captioner] 20:04:54
 CAN GO TO NET ZERO?
>> YEAH, I MEAN, THE

[Captioner] 20:04:58
 AREAS WHERE MOST OF OUR EMISSIONS ARE ARE THE

[Captioner] 20:05:01
 TRANSPORTATION SECTOR AND THE BUILDING

[Captioner] 20:05:05
 SECTOR, SO WHEN IT COMES TO THE BUILT

[Captioner] 20:05:08
 ENVIRONMENT, YOU KNOW, EMISSIONS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH

[Captioner] 20:05:11
 ELECTRICITY -- GAS

[Captioner] 20:05:13
 USAGE.
ELECTRICITY IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY 

[Captioner] 20:05:16
CLEAN.
IF WE WERE TO ADOPT A CITY-WIDE POLICY 

[Captioner] 20:05:19
TO BRING EVERYBODY ON TO THE RENEWAL 100 RATE

[Captioner] 20:05:22
 PLAN UNDER EAST

[Captioner] 20:05:25
 BAY COMMUNITY ENERGY THAT WOULD MEAN ALL ELECTRICITY CONSUMED BY

[Captioner] 20:05:29
 FREMONT RES DEANSD BUSINESSES WHO ARE PART OF

[Captioner] 20:05:33
 EBCE WOULD BE ZERO EMISSIONS.
AND THEN WE HAVE TO LOOK AT GAS

[Captioner] 20:05:36
 CONSUMPTION.
SO THAT'S HOW CAN

[Captioner] 20:05:40
 WE ENCOURAGE REPLACEMENT OF GAS APPLIANCES AND

[Captioner] 20:05:43
 PROCESSES WITH ELECTRIC ONES WHEN THOSE

[Captioner] 20:05:47
 APPLIANCES ARE AT THE END OF THEIR LIFE, HOW CAN

[Captioner] 20:05:51
 WE REQUIRE NEW DEVELOPMENTS TO BE

[Captioner] 20:05:54
 ALL ELECTRIC IN DESIGN, AND THEN, YOU KNOW, FROM A

[Captioner] 20:05:57
 LARGER INFRASTRUCTURE PERSPECTIVE, YOU KNOW, WHAT CAN WE

[Captioner] 20:06:01
 DO TO, YOU KNOW, PARTNER WITH EAST BAY COMMUNITY

[Captioner] 20:06:04
 ENERGY AND

[Captioner] 20:06:08
 PG&E TO ENSURE THERE'S ENOUGH GRID CAPACITY

[Captioner] 20:06:11
 TO SUPPORT ELECTRIFICATION AND ALSO TO START TO TAPER OFF OF

[Captioner] 20:06:14
 GAS AND MAYBE, YOU KNOW, LONG TERM LOOK AT

[Captioner] 20:06:16
 RETIREMENT OF SOME OF THOSE GAS PIPELINES.


[Captioner] 20:06:22
THEN ON THE TRANSPORTATION SIDE, YOU KNOW, WE'RE LOOKING AT EMISSIONS

[Captioner] 20:06:24
 FROM BOTH PASSENGER VEHICLES AND FREIGHT VEHICLES.


[Captioner] 20:06:28
AND THE PASSENGER VEHICLE SIDE, WE'VE SEEN AN INCREASING

[Captioner] 20:06:31
 TREND AND ADOPTION OF ELECTRIC VEHICLES.


[Captioner] 20:06:34
FREMONT HAS ONE OF THE HIGHEST EV OWNERSHIP LEVELS IN THE

[Captioner] 20:06:37
 STATE, AND YOU KNOW, AS WE HAVE

[Captioner] 20:06:41
 DONE OUR EMISSIONS INVENTORIES OVER THE YEARS, WE'VE

[Captioner] 20:06:43
 SEEN A REDUCTION IN EMISSIONS ASSOCIATED WITH PASSENGER VEHICLES.


[Captioner] 20:06:48
THAT'S BOTH BECAUSE OF TOTAL VEHICLE MILES

[Captioner] 20:06:51
 TRAVELED AS WELL AS IMPROVEMENTS IN OVERALL FUEL EFFICIENCY,

[Captioner] 20:06:53
 AND THAT INCREASE IN ELECTRIC VEHICLES.


[Captioner] 20:06:57
AND THEN ON THE FREIGHT SIDE, WE REALLY

[Captioner] 20:07:00
 HAVEN'T SEEN IMPROVEMENTS IN THE FUEL EFFICIENCY OF

[Captioner] 20:07:02
 THOSE FREIGHT VEHICLES IN A SIGNIFICANT WAY YET.


[Captioner] 20:07:06
WE'RE JUST AT THE PRECIPICE OF FREIGHT VEHICLES, YOU

[Captioner] 20:07:09
 KNOW, STARTING TO CONVERT TO HYDROGEN FUEL

[Captioner] 20:07:12
 OR ELECTRICITY,

[Captioner] 20:07:15
 AND WE'VE ALSO SEEN A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED

[Captioner] 20:07:18
 OF FREIGHT VEHICLES.
SO THE EMISSIONS IMPACT OF THE FREIGHT 

[Captioner] 20:07:21
SECTOR HAS ACTUALLY GONE UP.


[Captioner] 20:07:25
SO THAT'S WHERE WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT AREAS

[Captioner] 20:07:28
 TO FOCUS ON IN TERMS OF INCREASING ELECTRIC

[Captioner] 20:07:31
 VEHICLE CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE,

[Captioner] 20:07:34
 SUPPLYING THAT ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING WITH CLEANPOWER FROM

[Captioner] 20:07:37
 THE GRID, LOOKING AT, YOU KNOW, HYDROGEN

[Captioner] 20:07:40
 FUELING AS WELL, AND THEN

[Captioner] 20:07:43
 IN TERMS OF PASSENGER VEHICLES AND VEHICLE MILES

[Captioner] 20:07:47
 TRAVELED, GETTING PEOPLE TO DRIVE

[Captioner] 20:07:50
 LESS, SO USING PUBLIC TRANSIT, WALKING, BIKING,

[Captioner] 20:07:54
 ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION, MICROMOBILITY,

[Captioner] 20:07:57
 AND THEN ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO USE PUBLIC

[Captioner] 20:08:00
 TRANSIT, WHICH WE'VE SEEN A SUBSTANTIAL DECLINE IN THE USE

[Captioner] 20:08:03
 OF PUBLIC TRANSIT SINCE THE PANDEMIC

[Captioner] 20:08:07
, AND THEN FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE DRIVING, DRIVING CLEAN VEHICLES,

[Captioner] 20:08:11
 AND ALSO NOT DRIVING ALONE.
SO WE HAVE GOALS

[Captioner] 20:08:14
 ALREADY ESTABLISHED UNDER THE MOBILITY ACTION PLAN, FOR

[Captioner] 20:08:17
 INSTANCE, TO DECREASE THE DRIVE-ALONE RATE OF PASSENGER

[Captioner] 20:08:21
 VEHICLES AND TO INCREASE USE OF

[Captioner] 20:08:23
 MICROMOBILITY.
SO THOSE ARE ALL THINGS WE CAN DO.


[Captioner] 20:08:27
THOSE ARE REALLY THE BIG HITTERS IN TERMS OF

[Captioner] 20:08:29
 EMISSIONS.
>> Councilmember Salwan: THANK YOU FOR 

[Captioner] 20:08:29
THAT OVERVIEW.
THAT WAS GREAT.


[Captioner] 20:08:33
WERE YOU GOING TO SAY ANYTHING?
>> City Mgr. Shackelford: NO, GO 

[Captioner] 20:08:34
AHEAD.
WAS THERE ANOTHER QUESTION?


[Captioner] 20:08:37
>> Councilmember Salwan: OH, YES.
DO WE MEASURE OUR GREENHOUSE GASES?


[Captioner] 20:08:40
I MEAN, I KNOW WE HAD

[Captioner] 20:08:43
 THE 2012 PLAN.
ARE WE HITTING THE GOALS WE SET SO 

[Captioner] 20:08:46
FAR?
>> YES, SO YOU KNOW, WE

[Captioner] 20:08:50
 DO A GREENHOUSE GAS INVENTORY AT LEAST ON A

[Captioner] 20:08:53
 FIVE-YEAR BASIS.
WE TRY TO DO IT MORE OFTEN THAN THAT.


[Captioner] 20:08:56
THERE'S A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF WORK THAT GOES INTO COLLECTING THE

[Captioner] 20:08:59
 DATA ASSOCIATED WITH THE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS INVENTORY,

[Captioner] 20:09:03
 SO OUR

[Captioner] 20:09:06
 -- FOR 2005.
WE HAD A 2010 UPDATE, A 2015 UPDATE 

[Captioner] 20:09:09
AND THEN FOR THE PLAN, WE LOOKED AT EMISSIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE

[Captioner] 20:09:12
 YEAR 2018, BECAUSE WE STARTED TO COLLECT THAT DATA

[Captioner] 20:09:16
 IN 2020 AS WE WERE WORKING ON THIS PLAN,

[Captioner] 20:09:21
 AND CONSIDERED POTENTIALLY USING 2020 BUT

[Captioner] 20:09:24
 REALIZED THAT YOU KNOW, AS WE ENTERED THE PANDEMIC, THERE

[Captioner] 20:09:27
 WERE ANOMALIES IN THE DATA THAT WE DIDN'T WANT TO

[Captioner] 20:09:30
 KIND RELY ON IN TERMS OF LOOKING AT LONG TERM

[Captioner] 20:09:34
 TRENDS, SO WHEN WE

[Captioner] 20:09:37
 DID OUR 2018 INVENTORY UPDATE, WE SAW WE HAD ACTUALLY ACHIEVED

[Captioner] 20:09:41
 THE GOAL OF THE FIRST CLIMATE ACTION PLAN IN TERMS OF THAT

[Captioner] 20:09:43
 25% EMISSION REDUCTION BY THE YEAR 2020.


[Captioner] 20:09:47
A BIG PORTION OF THOSE EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS ACTUALLY

[Captioner] 20:09:50
 CAME FROM CLEANER ELECTRICITY CONSUMPTION, SO

[Captioner] 20:09:53
 WHEN WE JOINED EAST BAY COMMUNITY ENERGY, WE IMMEDIATELY HAD A

[Captioner] 20:09:56
 REDUCTION IN THE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS ASSOCIATED WITH ENERGY BEING

[Captioner] 20:10:00
 USED FROM THE GRID, BECAUSE

[Captioner] 20:10:04
 EBCE PUT OUT A CLEANER RATE

[Captioner] 20:10:07
 PLAN THAN PG&E HAD AT THE TIME.
SO WE SAW A

[Captioner] 20:10:10
 10% REDUCTION IN EMISSIONS FROM THAT.
MOVING

[Captioner] 20:10:13
 FORWARD, THOUGH, YOU KNOW, TO ACHIEVE

[Captioner] 20:10:17
 THOSE ADDITIONAL GOALS WE HAVE FOR 2030

[Captioner] 20:10:20
 AND 2045, IT WILL REQUIRE LOOKING AT THOSE AREAS THAT I MENTIONED

[Captioner] 20:10:23
 PREVIOUSLY.


[Captioner] 20:10:27
>> Councilmember Salwan: YOU MENTIONED A NEW FRAMEWORK ABOUT LIKE

[Captioner] 20:10:30
 SEE

[Captioner] 20:10:33
 CEQA AND LOOKING AT PROJECTS THROUGH THIS CLIMATE ACTION PLAN.


[Captioner] 20:10:35
COULD YOU KIND OF EXPLAIN THAT A LITTLE FURTHER?


[Captioner] 20:10:38
I WAS KIND OF INTRIGUED BY THAT.
>> SO OUR FIRST CLIMATE

[Captioner] 20:10:41
 ACTION PLAN WAS NOT WHAT WE'D TERM A SEE

[Captioner] 20:10:45
 CEQA

[Captioner] 20:10:48
 QUALIFIED PLAN.
IT DIDN'T TIE INTO THE

[Captioner] 20:10:51
 DEVELOPMENT PROCESS.
THIS CLIMATE ACTION PLAN, YOU

[Captioner] 20:10:55
 KNOW, WHAT WE'LL BE DOING AND WHAT

[Captioner] 20:10:58
 OUR CONSULTANT IS WORKING ON NOW

[Captioner] 20:11:02
 IS A DOCUMENT THAT PROVIDES THE

[Captioner] 20:11:05
 BASIS FOR EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE

[Captioner] 20:11:09
 MEASURES AND ACTIONS IN OUR PLAN, AND THEN PROVIDING

[Captioner] 20:11:13
 A CHECKLIST THAT CAN BE UTILIZED AT THE PROJECT LEVEL BY OUR

[Captioner] 20:11:16
 PLANNERS TO SAY, WHEN A NEW PROJECT COMES

[Captioner] 20:11:19
 THROUGH, IF YOU DO THESE THINGS, THESE ACTIONS, IF

[Captioner] 20:11:22
 YOU INCORPORATE THESE DIFFERENT ACTIONS INTO

[Captioner] 20:11:25
 YOUR PROJECT, WHICH ARE SPECIFICALLY TIED TO OUR

[Captioner] 20:11:29
 CLIMATE ACTION PLAN WHICH WE'VE DONE EMISSION REDUCTION CALCULATIONS

[Captioner] 20:11:33
 FOR, THEN YOU ARE ALIGNING WITH OUR CLIMATE ACTION PLAN, YOU DON'T

[Captioner] 20:11:36
 HAVE -- YOU KNOW, YOU'RE SHOWING THAT YOU'RE REDUCING

[Captioner] 20:11:39
 THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF YOUR PROJECT, YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO YOUR OWN

[Captioner] 20:11:43
 EMISSIONS REDUCTION ANALYSIS AND PROPOSE

[Captioner] 20:11:46
 MEASURES FOR MITIGATION THAT MIGHT NOT BE EXACTLY ALIGNED WITH

[Captioner] 20:11:50
 OUR PLAN.
SO BY DOING A

[Captioner] 20:11:53
 CEQA QUALIFIED PLAN,

[Captioner] 20:11:57
 WE'RE, ONE, HELPING THOSE DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS THAT ARE

[Captioner] 20:12:00
 ENVIRONMENTALLY FOCUSED TO GET THROUGH THE PROCESS

[Captioner] 20:12:03
 POTENTIALLY FASTER, BUT THEN ALSO ENSURE

[Captioner] 20:12:07
ING THAT THOSE PROJECTS THAT ARE COMING THROUGH THAT ARE ENVIRONMENTALLY 

[Captioner] 20:12:11
ALIGNED ARE ACHIEVING THE GOALS OF OUR PLAN

[Captioner] 20:12:15
 BECAUSE THEY'RE TIERING OFF OF IT.
DOES THAT

[Captioner] 20:12:18
 MAKE SENSE?
>> Councilmember Salwan: YEAH, THAT'S 

[Captioner] 20:12:21
GOOD.
HOPEFULLY WE CAN GRADE THEM, HOW 

[Captioner] 20:12:22
CLIMATE-FRIENDLY THEY ARE.
THEN YOU MENTIONED THE GRID.


[Captioner] 20:12:26
I KNOW THAT'S A BIG FACTOR IN ALL THIS ELECTRIFICATION, IS

[Captioner] 20:12:29
 CAN THE GRID HANDLE IT.
SO HOPEFULLY -- I

[Captioner] 20:12:31
 GUESS WE'LL HAVE TO WORK WITH THE STATE OR --


[Captioner] 20:12:34
>> YEAH, YOU KNOW, THERE'S SOME INTERESTING

[Captioner] 20:12:38
 STUDIES BEING DONE RIGHT NOW, I ACTUALLY WAS JUST READING

[Captioner] 20:12:41
 AN ARTICLE TODAY THAT, YOU KNOW, THERE WAS A STUDY DONE AT THE STATE

[Captioner] 20:12:45
 LEVEL THAT SAID THE COST OF MODERNIZING THE GRID

[Captioner] 20:12:48
 TO SUPPORT ELECTRIFICATION, YOU KNOW, REALLY KIND OF

[Captioner] 20:12:52
 FOCUSING ON

[Captioner] 20:12:56
 THE ELECTRIC VEHICLES COMING ON TO THE GRID WOULD BE

[Captioner] 20:12:59
 $50 BILLION, AND THEN THIS NEW STUDY SAID

[Captioner] 20:13:03
 ACTUALLY IF WE LOOK AT THE TIME THOSE VEHICLES ARE CHARGING

[Captioner] 20:13:06
 AND WE DO MANAGE CHARGING AND NOT HAVE ALL THE VEHICLES

[Captioner] 20:13:09
 PLUGGING IN AT ONCE, THEN IT COULD BE SUBSTANTIALLY LESS,

[Captioner] 20:13:12
 SO THIS AREA WAS SAYING LIKE 15

[Captioner] 20:13:15
 TO $20 BILLION, STILL A VERY LARGE

[Captioner] 20:13:19
 CHUNK OF CHANGE, BUT THERE'S

[Captioner] 20:13:22
 A SIGNIFICANT RECOGNITION FROM THE STATE AND THE UTILITIES

[Captioner] 20:13:26
 THAT INFRASTRUCTURE UPGRADES ARE GOING TO HAVE TO HAPPEN

[Captioner] 20:13:29
 TO SUPPORT THE GOALS THAT THE STATE HAS

[Captioner] 20:13:34
 ADOPTED, AND WE'RE -- IN THINKING

[Captioner] 20:13:37
 ABOUT OUR OWN FACILITIES AND TRYING TO ELECTRIFY OUR

[Captioner] 20:13:40
 BUILDINGS AND CONVERT OUR FLEET VEHICLES TO

[Captioner] 20:13:43
 ELECTRIC, YOU KNOW, CAN OUR OWN INFRASTRUCTURE HANDLE THAT AND

[Captioner] 20:13:47
 WHAT KIND OF INVESTMENTS DO WE NEED TO MAKE TO BRING

[Captioner] 20:13:50
 THEM, YOU KNOW, TO THAT TIER.
SO IT IS

[Captioner] 20:13:53
 A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT.
THERE'S GOING TO BE SOME

[Captioner] 20:13:57
 STRUGGLES OVER THE COMING YEARS FROM THIS BIGGER INFRASTRUCTURE

[Captioner] 20:14:00
 PERSPECTIVE, BUT IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE KNOW NEED TO HAPPENS A WELL.


[Captioner] 20:14:04
>> Councilmember Salwan: THANK YOU.
AND LAST QUESTION, I THINK YOU 

[Captioner] 20:14:06
MENTIONED DEDICATED FUNDING FOR THE FIRST TIME FROM THE CIP.


[Captioner] 20:14:10
IS THAT REFERRING TO THE NEW EV CARS AND THE

[Captioner] 20:14:14
 ELECTRICAL CHARGING STATIONS?
>>

[Captioner] 20:14:18
 YEAH, SO THERE ARE

[Captioner] 20:14:21
 5 MILLION ALLOCATION FOR EV STRUCTURE UPGRADES

[Captioner] 20:14:24
 AND ALSO AN ALLOCATION FOR HVAC REPLACEMENT, I BELIEVE --

[Captioner] 20:14:28
 WAS IT 9 MILLION, DAN?
HANS WOULD REMEMBER.


[Captioner] 20:14:31
BUT IT'S AN ALLOCATION FOR THE FACILITY

[Captioner] 20:14:34
 UPGRADES, ESPECIALLY RELATED TO THE HVAC

[Captioner] 20:14:38
 REPLACEMENT, AND LOOKING AT ELECTRIFY

[Captioner] 20:14:41
ING THOSE AGO WELL.
I HAVE A NOTE ON IT SOMEWHERE.


[Captioner] 20:14:43
>> Councilmember Salwan: IT'S OKAY, THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:14:44
I REMEMBER.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.


[Captioner] 20:14:46
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU, COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN.


[Captioner] 20:14:50
NEXT FOR CLARIFYING QUESTIONS, COUNCILMEMBER KENG.


[Captioner] 20:14:55
>> Councilmember Keng: THANK

[Captioner] 20:14:58
 YOU, MADAME MAYOR, AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH

[Captioner] 20:15:02
, FOR YOUR REPORT.
I SEE WE HAVE THE DATA

[Captioner] 20:15:06
 THAT THE CITY OF FREMONT, OUR GREENHOUSE

[Captioner] 20:15:09
 EMISSION HAD A REDUCTION OF 29.7%

[Captioner] 20:15:12
 FROM 2005, AND I THINK WE HAD COME A LONG

[Captioner] 20:15:16
 WAY AND OUR NEXT GOAL

[Captioner] 20:15:20
 OF -- TO GREENHOUSE EMISSION LEVEL IS

[Captioner] 20:15:24
 TO BE REDUCED BY 55%

[Captioner] 20:15:27
 BY 2030, WHICH BY MY CALCULATION IF NOT

[Captioner] 20:15:31
 WRONG IS 25% IN THE NEXT SEVEN YEARS.
SO DO

[Captioner] 20:15:34
 YOU THINK -- I THINK MAYBE SOME OVERLAPPING WITH SOME OF YOUR

[Captioner] 20:15:37
 PREVIOUS ANSWERS BUT MAYBE IF YOU COULD RECAP FOR

[Captioner] 20:15:40
 US HOW THE PREVIOUS REDUCTION

[Captioner] 20:15:44
 OF 29.7%, HOW THAT WAS MEASURED

[Captioner] 20:15:47
 AND HOW THASTLES ACHIEVED, MAJORITY

[Captioner] 20:15:50
 OF IT.
>> SO THE REDUCTION WAS ACTUALLY 

[Captioner] 20:15:54
CLOSER TO 25%, AND YOU KNOW, THERE'S ALSO --

[Captioner] 20:15:57
 WHEN WE'VE DONE INVENTORY UPDATES, WE'VE INCLUDED SOME NEW

[Captioner] 20:16:00
 SECTORS THAT WEREN'T IN THE ORIGINAL INVENTORY, SO YOU KNOW,

[Captioner] 20:16:03
 IT MIGHT LOOK KIND OF WEIRD IF YOU'RE LOOKING BACK AT

[Captioner] 20:16:06
 OLD NUMBERS.
BUT YEAH, SO YOU KNOW, IT'S ANOTHER

[Captioner] 20:16:10
 30% REDUCTION FROM THE 2018 LEVELS

[Captioner] 20:16:13
 TO 2030 THAT WE'RE LOOKING TO ACHIEVE WITH THIS

[Captioner] 20:16:17
 PLAN, AND LIKE I WAS SAYING

[Captioner] 20:16:20
 TO COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN, THERE'S A LOT OF WORK THAT

[Captioner] 20:16:23
 WE CAN DO IN THE BUILDING AND THE TRANSPORTATION

[Captioner] 20:16:27
 SECTORS TO ACHIEVE THOSE EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS.


[Captioner] 20:16:30
YOU KNOW, SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE CAN DO ARE

[Captioner] 20:16:34
 ENCOURAGING BUSINESSES AND RESIDENTS TO ADOPT

[Captioner] 20:16:37
 NEW TECHNOLOGIES.
SOME OF THE THINGS WE CAN DO ARE

[Captioner] 20:16:40
 GOING TO REQUIRE POLICY MEASURES,

[Captioner] 20:16:43
 SO IF WE, FOR INSTANCE, WERE

[Captioner] 20:16:46
 TO ADOPT RENEWABLE 100 AS THE

[Captioner] 20:16:50
 BASE ELECTRIC RATE PLAN FOR RESIDENTS AND BUSINESSES IN

[Captioner] 20:16:53
 FREMONT, THEN THAT WOULD BE 100% CLEAN ELECTRICITY.


[Captioner] 20:16:57
SO THERE ARE POLICY ME

[Captioner] 20:17:00
 MEASURES WE CAN TAKE THAT WILL HAVE THOSE

[Captioner] 20:17:03
 REDUCTIONS.
THE NEW CONSTRUCTION SECTOR IS NOT 

[Captioner] 20:17:07
GOING TO ACHIEVE NEARLY AS MUCH OF A EMISSIONS REDUCTION

[Captioner] 20:17:10
 AS LOOKING AT EXISTING BUILDINGS.
SO THAT IS

[Captioner] 20:17:14
 SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT AS WELL.
YOU KNOW, HOW

[Captioner] 20:17:17
 CAN WE ENSURE THAT EXISTING BUILDINGS ARE

[Captioner] 20:17:20
 REDUCING THEIR ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT BY USING

[Captioner] 20:17:24
 CLEANPOWER, YOU KNOW, INSTALLING SOLAR,

[Captioner] 20:17:27
 AND THEN ELECTRIFYING THEIR PROCESSES

[Captioner] 20:17:30
 AND APPLIANCES AS WELL.
DID I ANSWER THAT QUESTION?


[Captioner] 20:17:32
>> Councilmember Keng: YES, THANK YOU.
>> OKAY.


[Captioner] 20:17:37
>> Mayor Mei: NEXT CLARIFYING QUESTIONS, COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL.


[Captioner] 20:17:43
>> Councilmember Campbell: HELLO

[Captioner] 20:17:46
.
THANK YOU, YOU ANSWERED QUITE A FEW OF 

[Captioner] 20:17:50
MY QUESTIONS DURING THE Q & A, AND YOU ALSO SPENT

[Captioner] 20:17:54
 A WHOLE HOUR WITH ME, SHARING YOUR PLAN, AND I REALLY,

[Captioner] 20:17:57
 REALLY DO APPRECIATE IT.
ESPECIALLY BEING THE NEWEST

[Captioner] 20:18:01
 COUNCILMEMBER.
BUT I

[Captioner] 20:18:04
 DID -- THROUGH YOUR PRESENTATION,

[Captioner] 20:18:06
 I COULD ASK A COUPLE OF ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS.


[Captioner] 20:18:09
ONE IS ABOUT THE GASOLINE STATIONS.
I NOTICED

[Captioner] 20:18:12
 THAT A NEW STATION IS COMING UP AT MISSION

[Captioner] 20:18:15
 AND NILES BOULEVARD, THERE'S A BIG ONE ON THE CORNER THERE.


[Captioner] 20:18:20
AND I WAS WONDERING ABOUT

[Captioner] 20:18:24
 WHETHER OR NOT FREMONT NEEDS MORE GASOLINE

[Captioner] 20:18:27
 STATIONS.
WHO WE BE

[Captioner] 20:18:30
 GETTING AHEAD OF OURSELVES IF WE PROHIBITED GASOLINE STATIONS BECAUSE 

[Captioner] 20:18:33
WE NEED THEM OR BECAUSE THERE'S STILL ATE

[Captioner] 20:18:37
 A LOT OF CARS OUT THERE THAT TAKE

[Captioner] 20:18:40
 GAS, MINE BEING ONE OF THEM, AND SO I

[Captioner] 20:18:43
 WOULD NOT LIKE TO HAVE TO TRAVEL WAY ACROSS THE

[Captioner] 20:18:46
 CITY TO GET GAS.
WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT?


[Captioner] 20:18:49
>> YEAH, SO, YOU KNOW, THE ACTION

[Captioner] 20:18:52
 THAT'S IN THE PLAN RELATED TO PUTTING A

[Captioner] 20:18:55
 MORATORIUM ON NEW GASOLINE SERVICE STATIONS IS SOMETHING THAT WOULD HAVE

[Captioner] 20:18:59
 TO COME TO COUNCIL AS AN

[Captioner] 20:19:02
 ITEM.
IT'S NOT IN THE

[Captioner] 20:19:05
 THREE-YEAR GAME PLAN AT THIS TIME.
BUT

[Captioner] 20:19:08
 THERE WOULD BE ANALYSIS WE WOULD DO

[Captioner] 20:19:11
 AT THAT POINT TO LOOK AT HOW MANY GASOLINE SERVICE STATIONS DO WE HAVE 

[Captioner] 20:19:14
IN FREMONT, YOU KNOW, WHAT IS THE AMOUNT

[Captioner] 20:19:18
 OF GAS VEHICLE VERSUS ELECTRIC VEHICLE OWNERSHIP, YOU

[Captioner] 20:19:22
 KNOW, WHAT ARE THE TRENDS, YOU KNOW

[Captioner] 20:19:25
, WOULD IT BE A BURDEN TO DISALLOW

[Captioner] 20:19:28
 NEW GAS STATIONS AND WOULD

[Captioner] 20:19:31
 THAT BURDEN BE OVERSHADOWED BY THE

[Captioner] 20:19:34
 BENEFIT OF THE EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS ACHIEVED.


[Captioner] 20:19:37
SO WE WOULD BE DOING SOME SUBSTANTIAL ANALYSIS IF WE

[Captioner] 20:19:40
 WERE TO BRING THAT FORWARD.
IN THE SHORT TERM,

[Captioner] 20:19:44
 THE FOCUS IS REALLY TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF ELECTRIC VEHICLE

[Captioner] 20:19:48
 CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE AVAILABLE IN THE COMMUNITY, SO THAT

[Captioner] 20:19:51
 WE'RE CONTINUING TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO ADOPT EVs.


[Captioner] 20:19:54
YOU KNOW, EVs HAVE

[Captioner] 20:19:58
 BEEN MORE EXPENSIVE THAN GAS VEHICLES,

[Captioner] 20:20:01
 TRADITIONALLY THERE HAVE BEEN INCENTIVES TO HELP REDUCE THAT

[Captioner] 20:20:04
 COST.
CURRENTLY THE FEDERAL TAX CREDIT 

[Captioner] 20:20:08
ASSOCIATED WITH ELECTRIC VEHICLES ARE LIMITED TO VEHICLES

[Captioner] 20:20:11
 THAT HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF THEIR COMPONENTS

[Captioner] 20:20:15
 MANUFACTURED IN THE U.S., SO THAT IS A VERY LIMITED AMOUNT

[Captioner] 20:20:18
 OF VEHICLES.
BUT THERE ARE ALSO PROGRAMS LIKE

[Captioner] 20:20:21
 THE CLEAN CARS FOR ALL THAT IS MANAGED BY

[Captioner] 20:20:25
 THE BAY AREA QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT THAT

[Captioner] 20:20:28
 ALLOWS THE PURCHASE OF USED ELECTRIC VEHICLES FOR

[Captioner] 20:20:31
 PEOPLE WHO BECOME QUALIFIED.
SO WE WANT TO

[Captioner] 20:20:35
 ENCOURAGE THOSE KINDS OF PROGRAMS TO

[Captioner] 20:20:39
 ALLOW ELECTRIC VEHICLE

[Captioner] 20:20:42
 OWNERSHIP OVER ALL LEVELS SO REALLY THINKING ABOUT

[Captioner] 20:20:45
 THE EQUITY CONSIDERATIONS THERE, AND THEN PROVIDING THAT INFRASTRUCTURE 

[Captioner] 20:20:48
THAT CAN SUPPORT THAT.
SO CURRENTLY IF YOU'RE IN A 

[Captioner] 20:20:52
SINGLE-FAMILY HOME, IT'S FAIRLY EASY TO PUT

[Captioner] 20:20:55
 IN YOUR OWN, YOU KNOW, CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT

[Captioner] 20:20:58
 AN ELECTRIC VEHICLE, BUT IF YOU LIVE IN

[Captioner] 20:21:01
 MULTIFAMILY HOUSING, APARTMENTS OR CONDOS, IT'S A LOT MORE

[Captioner] 20:21:05
 DIFFICULT TO DO THAT.
AND SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE

[Captioner] 20:21:08
 BEEN WORKING ON IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE EAST BAY COMMUNITY ENERGY

[Captioner] 20:21:11
 IS IDENTIFYING LOCATIONS THAT EBCE

[Captioner] 20:21:15
 CONSIDERS MULTIFAMILY HOT SPOTS.
SO WHERE THERE'S A LOT OF

[Captioner] 20:21:18
 MULTIFAMILY PROPERTIES IN A LOCAL AREA

[Captioner] 20:21:23
, AND LOOKING AT CITY PROPERTIES WHERE EAST BAY

[Captioner] 20:21:26
 COMMUNITY ENERGY COULD ACTUALLY INSTALL

[Captioner] 20:21:29
 DC FAST CHARGING STATIONS, THESE HUBS OF FAST CHARGING STATIONS,

[Captioner] 20:21:32
 SO 12 OR MORE CHARGERS IN ONE LOCATION, TO ALLOW FOR

[Captioner] 20:21:36
 PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN THOSE KINDS OF UNITS

[Captioner] 20:21:39
 TO COME AND CHARGE THEIR VEHICLES QUICKLY AND THEN

[Captioner] 20:21:42
 GO BACK HOME, SO THAT THEY'RE NOT DEALING WITH THE

[Captioner] 20:21:45
 CHALLENGES OF AN HOA OR PROPERTY

[Captioner] 20:21:48
 MANAGER WHO DOESN'T WANT TO SUPPORT THAT INFRASTRUCTURE.


[Captioner] 20:21:53
SO HOPEFULLY THAT'S HELPFUL.
>> Councilmember Campbell:

[Captioner] 20:21:56
 YES, THAT WAS VERY HELPFUL.
BUT MY NEXT QUESTION, SPEAKING OF

[Captioner] 20:22:00
 INCENTIVES, THAT WAS MY NEXT QUESTION.


[Captioner] 20:22:06
BECAUSE YOU MENTIONED TWO THINGS.
ONE WAS

[Captioner] 20:22:09
 INCENTIVE -- OR HAVING SOME

[Captioner] 20:22:12
 PLAN AROUND RESIDENTIAL

[Captioner] 20:22:15
 PROPERTY TURNING THEIR HOMES INTO, YOU KNOW,

[Captioner] 20:22:19
 FROM GAS TO ELECTRIC, FROM GAS STOVES, FROM

[Captioner] 20:22:22
 GAS FURNACES, AND THEN YOU ALSO MENTIONED

[Captioner] 20:22:27
 THE BUSINESSES AND ESPECIALLY NEW

[Captioner] 20:22:30
 DEVELOPMENT GOING TO ELECTRIC

[Captioner] 20:22:33
.
ARE THERE ANY --

[Captioner] 20:22:37
 IS THE CITY CONSIDERING ANY INCENTIVE PROGRAMS FOR EACH OF THESE

[Captioner] 20:22:40
 TYPES OF CONVERSIONS?
>> YEAH, SO WE'RE

[Captioner] 20:22:43
 NOT OFFERING INCENTIVE DISTRICT DRECTLY FROM THE

[Captioner] 20:22:46
S

[Captioner] 20:22:49
 DIRECTLY FROM THE CITY BUT THERE ARE STATE, REGIONAL AND

[Captioner] 20:22:52
 FEDERAL PROGRAMS TO SUPPORT THAT.


[Captioner] 20:22:56
SO OUR JOB IS REALLY TO ADVERTISE

[Captioner] 20:22:59
 THOSE PROGRAMS, TO WORK WITH THE ORGANIZES THAT HAVE

[Captioner] 20:23:02
 THOSE INCENTIVES AVAILABLE AND MAKE SURE PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT THEM AND ARE 

[Captioner] 20:23:05
ABLE TO ACCESS THEM.
SOME OF THOSE 16TIVES GO DIRECTLY TO 

[Captioner] 20:23:08
THE CONSUMER, AND SOME OF THEM MAY GO TO, YOU KNOW,

[Captioner] 20:23:11
 THE VENDOR, THE INSTALLER, SO THAT,

[Captioner] 20:23:14
 YOU KNOW, WHAT THE HOMEOWNER OR BUSINESS

[Captioner] 20:23:18
 OWNER IS PAYING FOR IS JUST THE POST

[Captioner] 20:23:21
 REBATE COST.
SO FOR INSTANCE,

[Captioner] 20:23:24
 THE BAY AREA REGIONAL ENERGY NETWORK, WHICH IS

[Captioner] 20:23:28
 THE NINE BAY AREA COUNTY PROGRAM FOR ENERGY

[Captioner] 20:23:31
 UPGRADES, CURRENTLY HAS AN INCENTIVE PROGRAM

[Captioner] 20:23:34
 FOR HOME UPGRADES WHERE, YOU KNOW, THEY LOOK AT KIND OF

[Captioner] 20:23:38
 A PACKAGE OF MEASURES SO YOU CAN DO INSTALLATION,

[Captioner] 20:23:41
 YOU CAN DO APPLIANCE UPGRADES, FURNACE, WATER

[Captioner] 20:23:44
 HEATER UPGRADES, AND THEY HAVE SPECIFIC INCENTIVES THAT

[Captioner] 20:23:47
 HELP WITH ELECTRIFICATION.


[Captioner] 20:23:52
SO THERE'S A HEAT PUMP WATER HEATER INCENTIVE THAT

[Captioner] 20:23:55
 REALLY HELPS TO OFFSET THE EXTRA COST OF

[Captioner] 20:23:58
 A HEAT PUMP WATER HEATER COMPARED TO A

[Captioner] 20:24:02
 CONVENTIONAL WATER E

[Captioner] 20:24:05
 HEATER.
SO THOSE ARE THE TYPES OF PROGRAMS WE 

[Captioner] 20:24:09
WANT TO ENCOURAGE, THERE'S A LOT OF EFFORT TO

[Captioner] 20:24:12
 INCREASE INCENTIVES TO PEOPLE WHO ARE LOW INCOME

[Captioner] 20:24:15
 OR OTHERWISE DISADVANTAGED.
WE'RE CURRENTLY LOOKING

[Captioner] 20:24:18
 AT WHAT ARE THOSE SOME OPPORTUNITIES?
WE

[Captioner] 20:24:22
 ACTUALLY JUST PUT OUT A FLYER TO ALL OF OUR MULTIFAMILY

[Captioner] 20:24:26
 AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROPERTY OWNERS AND MANAGERS ABOUT A

[Captioner] 20:24:29
 NUMBER OF DIFFERENT INCENTIVES THAT ARE OUT THERE FROM THE

[Captioner] 20:24:33
 REGIONAL AND THE STATE AND EVEN THE FEDERAL LEVEL TO HELP SUPPORT

[Captioner] 20:24:36
 THE UPGRADE OF LOW INCOME

[Captioner] 20:24:39
 AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROPERTIES.


[Captioner] 20:24:42
SO WE'RE CONSTANTLY TRYING TO, YOU KNOW, IDENTIFY THOSE OPPORTUNITY

[Captioner] 20:24:45
 AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE.
I MEAN, WE DON'T HAVE A

[Captioner] 20:24:49
 BUDGET TO OFFER INCENTIVES OURSELVES, BUT WE CAN SUPPORT THE WORK

[Captioner] 20:24:51
 THAT'S HAPPENING AT THE REGIONAL AND STATEWIDE LEVEL.


[Captioner] 20:24:55
>> Councilmember Campbell: WONDERFUL.
THAT WOULD BE GREAT INFORMATION TO

[Captioner] 20:24:58
 SHARE WITH ALL OF OUR FAMILIES

[Captioner] 20:25:01
 ACROSS OUR PLATFORMS OF

[Captioner] 20:25:05
 NEWSLETTERS, ET CETERA.
AND THEN MY LAST QUESTION IS, IN

[Captioner] 20:25:09
 TERMS OF BUILDING STANDARD, ARE THERE

[Captioner] 20:25:12
 BUILDING STANDARDS THAT WE WILL BE ADOPTING FOR NEW DEVELOPMENT, WHETHER

[Captioner] 20:25:15
 IT FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING OR

[Captioner] 20:25:19
 OTHERWISE, IN ADDITION TO BUSINESSES, RESIDENTIAL HOUSING, ET

[Captioner] 20:25:22
 CETERA?
>> SO THE CALIFORNIA

[Captioner] 20:25:25
 BUILDING STANDARD CODE GET UPDATED ON A THREE-YEAR CYCLE.


[Captioner] 20:25:30
AND THEN EVERY YEAR, THEY'RE

[Captioner] 20:25:33
 MAKING IMPROVEMENTS TO THE BUILDING STANDARDS RELATED

[Captioner] 20:25:36
 TO ENERGY, SO THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY CODE IS THE MOST

[Captioner] 20:25:40
 STRINGENT ENERGY CODE IN THE COUNTRY, AND A LOT OF

[Captioner] 20:25:43
 OTHER STATE ACTUALLY PIGGY BACK OFF OF OUR CALIFORNIA ENERGY

[Captioner] 20:25:47
 CODE, AND YET AT THE SAME TIME, YOU KNOW, THERE ARE

[Captioner] 20:25:49
 THINGS THAT STATEWIDE CODE MAY STILL NOT DO.


[Captioner] 20:25:53
AND SO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CAN ADOPT WHAT WE

[Captioner] 20:25:56
 CALL REACH CODES TO GO BEYOND THE STATE CODE, AND

[Captioner] 20:25:59
 WE HAVE TO DO IT AT THE LOCAL LEVEL, AND WE

[Captioner] 20:26:02
 HAVE TO PROVE THE COST-EFFECTIVENESS OF THOSE CODES

[Captioner] 20:26:05
 SO THERE IS ALL THESE EFFORTS SUPPORTED BY THE

[Captioner] 20:26:09
 UTILITY TO DO COST-EFFECTIVENESS STUDIES THAT WILL BACK

[Captioner] 20:26:13
 UP THOSE CODES

[Captioner] 20:26:16
 AND SO ONE OF THE VERY POPULAR MEASURES IN THIS

[Captioner] 20:26:19
 LAST BUILDING COLD CYCLE WAS TO

[Captioner] 20:26:23
 ADOPT -- REQUIRING NEW

[Captioner] 20:26:26
 CONSTRUCTION ESPECIALLY ON THE RESIDENTIAL SIDE TO BE ALL

[Captioner] 20:26:29
 ELECTRIC.
THERE'S NOW SOME CHALLENGES THE CITY 

[Captioner] 20:26:32
OF BERKELEY IS FACING BECAUSE OF THAT CODE, AND SO WE'RE LOOKING AT, YOU

[Captioner] 20:26:36
 KNOW, WHERE THERE MAY BE

[Captioner] 20:26:39
 OPPORTUNITY STILL TO ADOPT REACH CODES THAT

[Captioner] 20:26:43
 DON'T CONFLICT WITH -- OR CONFLICT

[Captioner] 20:26:46
 WITH, YOU KNOW, THE LEGAL CHALLENGES THAT BERKELEY IS

[Captioner] 20:26:49
 FACING, AND THOSE ARE THINGS THAT WE CAN

[Captioner] 20:26:52
 PROPOSE, YOU KNOW, TO THE SUSTAINABILITY COMMISSION TO RECOMMEND 

[Captioner] 20:26:55
TO COUNCIL.
THERE'S ALSO ON TOP OF

[Captioner] 20:26:58
 THE ENERGY CODE, THE CALIFORNIA GREEN BUILDING COAT,

[Captioner] 20:27:01
 AND THAT HAS MEASURES NOT JUST RELATED TO ENERGY, BUT

[Captioner] 20:27:04
 ALSO RELATED TO WATER CONSERVATION

[Captioner] 20:27:08
 AND THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF MATERIALS BEING USED

[Captioner] 20:27:12
 IN CONSTRUCTION AND SITE

[Captioner] 20:27:15
 CONSIDERATIONS, SO THAT'S ALSO SOMETHING WE CAN LOOK AT.


[Captioner] 20:27:19
THE CALIFORNIA GREEN BUILDING CODE HAS KIND OF MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS AND 

[Captioner] 20:27:22
THEN THEY HAVE WHAT WE CALL TIERS, SO TIER 1 AND

[Captioner] 20:27:25
 TIER 2, WHICH GO BEYOND THE BASE CODE, AND THOSE ARE

[Captioner] 20:27:28
 THINGS THAT LOOK REALLY -- CAN

[Captioner] 20:27:30
 ADOPT AS A PACKAGE OR INDIVIDUALLY AS MEASURES.


[Captioner] 20:27:34
SO SOME OF THOSE WE'VE LOOKED AT IN THE PAST AND HAVE ADOPTED IN

[Captioner] 20:27:37
 THE PAST, BUT AGAIN, IT A THREE-YEAR CYCLE, SO

[Captioner] 20:27:40
 ANYTHING WE ADOPT IN ONE THREE-YEAR CYCLE,

[Captioner] 20:27:43
 WE'D HAVE TO RE-EVALUATE AGAIN FOR

[Captioner] 20:27:46
 THE NEXT BUILDING CODE CYCLE.
>> Councilmember Campbell: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:27:49
>> Mayor Mei: SO REAL QUICKLY, I THINK WE HAVE MORE SPEAKERS

[Captioner] 20:27:52
 AND I KNOW QUESTIONS FROM THE COUNCIL BEFORE WE

[Captioner] 20:27:55
 CONTINUE AND WE'RE ABOUT TO GO TO A BREAK AT 8:30.


[Captioner] 20:27:58
SO I WAS GOING TO JUST RECOMMEND THAT WE TAKE A PAUSE FOR 10 MINUTES AND 

[Captioner] 20:28:00
THEN WE'LL RETURN BACK.
THANK YOU, AT THIS TIME.


[Captioner] 20:28:03
SO REALLY APPRECIATE THE PRESENTATION.
WE'LL BE BACK IN 10 MINUTES.


[Captioner] 20:29:08
[ RECESS

[Captioner] 20:29:12
 ]

[Captioner] 20:36:01
 IS

[Captioner] 20:40:36

>> Mayor Mei:   HI.


[Captioner] 20:40:38
WELCOME BACK TO THE JUNE 20th, 
CITY COUNCIL MEETING

[Captioner] 20:40:42
 AND WE'LL 
RESUME WITH OUR CLARIFYING

[Captioner] 20:40:45
 
QUESTIONS BEGINNING WITH

[Captioner] 20:40:46
 
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN.


[Captioner] 20:40:51
>> Councilmember Kassan:   I 
JUST PUT AN M

[Captioner] 20:40:55
&M IN MY MOUTH.
I

[Captioner] 20:40:58
 WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD 
TALK A BIT ABOUT THE FACT

[Captioner] 20:41:00
 THAT 
THE PLAN DOES SHOW THAT WE DON'T 


[Captioner] 20:41:04
MEET THE GOAL OF ZERO EMISSIONS

[Captioner] 20:41:06
 
BY I BELIEVE 2045.


[Captioner] 20:41:09
AND YOU KNOW I KNOW IT'S REALLY 
HARD TO PREDICT

[Captioner] 20:41:12
 THAT FAR IN 
ADVANCE BUT NEW COULD JUST

[Captioner] 20:41:14
 SAY A 
FEW WORDS ON YOUR THINKING ABOUT 


[Captioner] 20:41:16
THAT AND HOW WE MIGHT ADDRESS 
THAT.


[Captioner] 20:41:19
>> YES.
SO IT IS PRETTY DIFFICULT TO

[Captioner] 20:41:22
 
LOOK, YOU KNOW, THAT FAR

[Captioner] 20:41:26
, AND BE 
ABLE TO ACCURATELY

[Captioner] 20:41:28
 PREDICT WHAT 
OUR EMISSIONS WOULD LOOK LIKE.


[Captioner] 20:41:31
SO WHAT WE FOCUSED ON WAS THE 
EMISSIONS

[Captioner] 20:41:34
 DIRECTION ANALYSIS FOR 
2030 WITH THE ACTIONS THAT ARE 


[Captioner] 20:41:38
PRESENTED IN CHAPTER 3.
THE

[Captioner] 20:41:41
 ANALYSIS IF YOU GO INTO THE 
TECHNICAL MEMOS

[Captioner] 20:41:45
 PREPARED BY THE 
CONSULTANT TEAM DO LOOK AT 


[Captioner] 20:41:47
EMISSIONS ASSOCIATE ED WITH 
2045.


[Captioner] 20:41:50
WHAT WE HAVE TO REMEMBER IS THAT 
THEY ALL USE A BASELINE

[Captioner] 20:41:52
 
ASSUMPTION OF STATE POLICY 


[Captioner] 20:41:56
THAT'S CURRENTLY ENACTED AND NOT 
ANYTHING THAT MIGHT BE COMING 


[Captioner] 20:42:00
DOWN THE PIKE LATER ON.
SO AS NEW STATE

[Captioner] 20:42:03
 POLICIES ARE 
ADOPTED, THERE WILL BE EMISSION

[Captioner] 20:42:05
S 
REDUCTIONS IMPACTS ASSOCIATED 


[Captioner] 20:42:08
WITH THOSE AS WELL.
AND SO YOU KNOW WHAT WE CAN KIND 


[Captioner] 20:42:12
OF LOOK LIKE WITH A LITTLE BIT 
MORE CERTAINTY IS WHAT CAN WE

[Captioner] 20:42:15
 DO 
AT THE LOCAL LEVEL IN THE NEXT, 


[Captioner] 20:42:18
YOU KNOW, THREE TO SEVEN YEARS 
TO MAKE

[Captioner] 20:42:22
 A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT AND 
TO MEET OUR 2030 GOAL AND

[Captioner] 20:42:24
 THEN 
REEVALUATE, YOU KNOW, BEYOND 


[Captioner] 20:42:28
THAT TIME TO LOOK AT WHICH 
POLICIES ARE ADOPTED

[Captioner] 20:42:31
 NOW, WHAT 
TECHNOLOGIES ARE AVAILABLE NOW 


[Captioner] 20:42:34
AND HOW CAN THAT GET US TO THE 
2045 TARGET

[Captioner] 20:42:35
.
>> Councilmember Kassan:   YES 


[Captioner] 20:42:39
THAT MAKES SENSE.
AND THEN IN TERMS OF VEHICLE 


[Captioner] 20:42:42
MILES TRAVELED, I THINK

[Captioner] 20:42:44
 I SAW 
THAT IN THE LAST PERIOD OF 


[Captioner] 20:42:47
MEASUREMENT THEY HAD INCREASED 
EVEN THOUGH THE

[Captioner] 20:42:51
 TOTAL EMISSIONS 
HAD GONE DOWN BECAUSE OF CLEANER 


[Captioner] 20:42:54
CARS, THE TOTAL VEHICLE MILES 
TRAVELED HAD GONE UP QUITE A

[Captioner] 20:42:55
 
BIT.


[Captioner] 20:42:58
I THINK IT WAS LIKE 60% OR 
SOMETHING

[Captioner] 20:43:00
.
AND I ALSO NOTICED THAT A LOT OF 


[Captioner] 20:43:04
THE PROJECTED REDUCTIONS IN 
EMISSIONS GOING FORWARD

[Captioner] 20:43:06
 ARE 
BASED ON POLICIES THAT WOULD 


[Captioner] 20:43:10
REDUCE VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED.
SO I'M JUST WONDERING

[Captioner] 20:43:13
 HOW 
REALISTIC IT IS GIVEN THAT WE, 


[Captioner] 20:43:15
MANY PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN 
FROAVMENT ARE VERY ATTACHED TO 


[Captioner] 20:43:19
DRIVING ALONE.

[Captioner] 20:43:21

HOW REALISTIC IS IT SOME OF 


[Captioner] 20:43:25
THESE PROJECTIONS OF VEHICLE 
MILES TRAVELED BEING REDUCE

[Captioner] 20:43:28
ED?
>> YES, SO THE VEHICLE MILE

[Captioner] 20:43:31
 
TRAVEL INCREASE I THINK THAT 


[Captioner] 20:43:34
YOU'RE SPEAKING OF INCLUDED BOTH 
THE

[Captioner] 20:43:42
 
THE PASSENGER AND FREIGHT 


[Captioner] 20:43:45
VEHICLES.
THE PASSENGER

[Captioner] 20:43:49
 MILES REMAINED 
CONSTANT BUT

[Captioner] 20:43:53
 THE FREIGHT MILES 
GOING UP.


[Captioner] 20:43:56
THERE ARE THINGS THAT WE CAN DO 
AND WE HAVE DONE RELATED

[Captioner] 20:43:58
 TO LAND 
USE PLANNING.


[Captioner] 20:44:01
AND THEN YOU KNOW THERE ARE THE 
EMISSIONS ASSOCIATED

[Captioner] 20:44:04
 WITH THE 
VEHICLE MIMES TRAVELED 


[Captioner] 20:44:07
THEMSELVES, RIGHT?
SO THERE ARE MEASURES THAT WORK 


[Captioner] 20:44:10
TO ACHIEVE BOTH.
YOU KNOW WE HAVE

[Captioner] 20:44:14
 BEEN VERY 
FOCUSED ON TRYING TO IMPROVE OUR

[Captioner] 20:44:16
 
BIKE AND PEDESTRIAN 


[Captioner] 20:44:19
INFRASTRUCTURE IN FREMONT AND 
MAKE IT SAFER IN ALIGNMENT WITH 


[Captioner] 20:44:22
VISION ZERO AND OUR MOBILITY 
ACTION PLAN.

[Captioner] 20:44:26

AND, YOU KNOW, IT'S CHALLENGING 


[Captioner] 20:44:30
BECAUSE WE DO HAVE AS YOU SAID A 
CAR CULTURE HERE,

[Captioner] 20:44:33
 RIGHT?
FREMONT IS DESIGNED AROUND

[Captioner] 20:44:35
 USE 
OF THE VEHICLE.


[Captioner] 20:44:38
AND SO, YOU KNOW, THE LONG TERM 
LAND USE PLANNING

[Captioner] 20:44:41
 CHANGES TO 
INCREASE TRANSIT

[Captioner] 20:44:44
 ORIENTED 
DEVELOPMENT AND MAKE IT EASIER 


[Captioner] 20:44:47
TO GET TO PLACES WITHOUT USE OF 
A

[Captioner] 20:44:50
 VEHICLE, YOU KNOW, THOSE ARE 
GOING TO TAKE SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT

[Captioner] 20:44:52
 
OF TIME.


[Captioner] 20:44:55
AND SO IMPROVEMENTS IN THE TYPES 
OF VEHICLES THAT ARE

[Captioner] 20:44:58
 BEING USED 
ALSO ACHIEVE REDUCTION.

[Captioner] 20:45:00

SO WE'RE TRYING TO KIND OF GET 


[Captioner] 20:45:03
AT IT IN BOTH DIRECTIONS AND WE 
KNOW SOME THINGS ARE

[Captioner] 20:45:07
 GOING TO BE 
FASTER THAN OTHERS BUT

[Captioner] 20:45:10
 OVERALL 
BOTH NEED TO HAPPEN.


[Captioner] 20:45:12
>> Councilmember Kassan:   ONE 
LAST QUESTION.


[Captioner] 20:45:15
OFTEN WE MAKE DECISIONS AS A 
COUNCIL THAT AFFECT THESE THINGS

[Captioner] 20:45:17
 
THAT ARE BEING MEASURED AS 


[Captioner] 20:45:20
POTENTIAL THINGS THAT COULD 
AFFECT OUR

[Captioner] 20:45:21
 GREENHOUSE GAS 
EMISSIONS.


[Captioner] 20:45:25
AND I DON'T THINK THAT WE OFTEN 
GET A REPORT THAT TIES

[Captioner] 20:45:28
 THE 
DECISION TO A PARTICULAR MEASURE

[Captioner] 20:45:30
 
OF, YOU KNOW, WHAT DIFFERENT 


[Captioner] 20:45:33
DECISIONS -- WHAT THE RESULT OF 
DIFFERENT DECISIONS WOULD BE

[Captioner] 20:45:36
 
WITH RESPECT TO GREENHOUSE GAS 


[Captioner] 20:45:39
EMISSIONS.
AND I KNOW IT MAY BE REALLY 


[Captioner] 20:45:41
DIFFICULT TO QUANTIFY THAT FOR A 
SINGLE DECISION.


[Captioner] 20:45:44
BUT AT LEAST I WONDER IF PART OF 
THE PLAN

[Captioner] 20:45:48
 IS TO START TO GIVE A 
LITTLE BIT MORE

[Captioner] 20:45:51
 CONTEXT WHEN WE 
ARE MAKING LAND USE DECISIONS,

[Captioner] 20:45:52
 
TRANSPORTATION DECISIONS, YOU 


[Captioner] 20:45:56
KNOW, CITY SPENDING DECISIONS, 
TO TIE THAT TO

[Captioner] 20:45:59
 THIS PLAN.
SO THAT WE KEEP GET

[Captioner] 20:46:02
TING REMINDED 
OH YEAH WE SAID THIS IS PART OF

[Captioner] 20:46:04
 
ASSUMING THIS PLAN IS ADOPTED, 


[Captioner] 20:46:07
YOU KNOW, SO THAT THERE IS MORE 
CONNECTION BETWEEN DECISIONS WE 


[Captioner] 20:46:10
MAKE AS A COUNCIL AND THIS PLAN.
AND HOW

[Captioner] 20:46:14
 OUR DECISIONS GO AGAINST 
OR

[Captioner] 20:46:17
 SUPPORT THE PLAN.


[Captioner] 20:46:20
>> THANK YOU, COUNCILMEMBER 
KASSAN.


[Captioner] 20:46:23
WE'LL TAKE THAT AS A COMMENT 
THAT WE'LL TAKE BACK.

[Captioner] 20:46:24

>> Councilmember Kassan:   SORRY 


[Captioner] 20:46:26
I KNOW THIS IS QUESTION TIME BUT 
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:46:30
>> THAT'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION, 
THANK YOU FOR

[Captioner] 20:46:32
 THAT.
>> Mayor Mei:   NEXT IS 


[Captioner] 20:46:34
COUNCILMEMBER SHAO FOR 
CLARIFYING QUESTIONS.


[Captioner] 20:46:37
WE'LL HEAR FROM THE PUBLIC TOO.
>> Councilmember Shao:   THANK 


[Captioner] 20:46:40
YOU, MADAM MAYOR.
I ALREADY ASKED A QUESTION.


[Captioner] 20:46:43
MY SECOND QUESTION WOULD BE THAT 
CONSIDERING THAT THE

[Captioner] 20:46:46
 GREENHOUSE 
CARBON E

[Captioner] 20:46:49
MISSION MAINLY BY YOUR 
MEASUREMENT

[Captioner] 20:46:53
, YOU KNOW, OR JUST 
VEHICLE TRANSPORTATION

[Captioner] 20:46:56
, WHICH 
COMES FOR ABOUT 70

[Captioner] 20:47:00
 TO 80%, BASED 
ON THE MEMO THAT

[Captioner] 20:47:03
 YOU GENERATED 
MARCH 2022

[Captioner] 20:47:07
, SO YOU ALSO MENTION

[Captioner] 20:47:10

MENTIONED THAT BY CONVERTING

[Captioner] 20:47:14
 THE 
GAS-BURNING VEHICLES TO ELECTRIC

[Captioner] 20:47:17
 
VEHICLES WOULD CONTRIBUTE TO THE

[Captioner] 20:47:19
 
FINAL GOAL.


[Captioner] 20:47:22
THAT REMINDS ME OF OUR

[Captioner] 20:47:25
 CITY 
FLEET, WHICH NOT ONLY HAVE LIKE

[Captioner] 20:47:28
 
SEDANS OR POLICE CARS BUT ALSO 


[Captioner] 20:47:32
TRUCKS AND SOME HEAVY EQUIPMENT.

[Captioner] 20:47:36

RECENTLY WE ATTENDED THE

[Captioner] 20:47:39
 
BREAKFAST HELD BY THE AC TRANSIT

[Captioner] 20:47:43
 
WHICH SHARED THEIR

[Captioner] 20:47:46
 RESEARCH 
RESULT THAT SHOWED THAT

[Captioner] 20:47:50
 ACTUALLY 
CONVERTING THEIR BUSES IN GAS

[Captioner] 20:47:56
 FROM 
GAS-BURNING TO HYDROGEN SELL IS

[Captioner] 20:47:58
 
A BETTER OPTION THAN MAKING ALL 


[Captioner] 20:48:02
OF THEM ELECTRIC.
ENVIRONMENTAL WISE AND

[Captioner] 20:48:03
 OPTIONAL 
WISE.


[Captioner] 20:48:06
SO MY QUESTION TO YOU IS

[Captioner] 20:48:10
, IS 
HYDROGEN SELL ALSO

[Captioner] 20:48:14
 
HYDROGEN

[Captioner] 20:48:19
 CELL ONE OF THE OPTIONS 
WHEN THE CITY

[Captioner] 20:48:22
 WANTS TO CONVERT 
THEIR FLEET AND TRY

[Captioner] 20:48:25
 TO REDUCE 
CARBON EMISSION?


[Captioner] 20:48:28
>> CURRENTLY ON CITY FLEET WE 
ARE FOCUSED

[Captioner] 20:48:31
 PRIMARILY ON 
ELECTRIC VEHICLES AND LOOKING AT 


[Captioner] 20:48:35
THE LIGHT DUTY VEHICLE TYPES, 
MEM

[Captioner] 20:48:39
 AND HEAVY DUTY VEHICLE TYPES 
OAR FEW YEARS DOWN

[Captioner] 20:48:42
 THE ROAD IN 
TERMS OF HAVING GOOD OPTIONS FOR 


[Captioner] 20:48:44
REPLACEMENT.
SO WE CAN EVALUATE AT THAT TIME 


[Captioner] 20:48:47
IF HYDROGEN MIGHT MAKE MORE 
SENSE THAN ELECTRIC ON

[Captioner] 20:48:50
 THE 
COMMUNITY SIDE, YOU KNOW, WE ARE 


[Captioner] 20:48:54
SUPPORTING EFFORTS THAT WOULD 
BRING

[Captioner] 20:48:57
 IN HYDROGEN FUELING 
STATIONS FOR HEAVY-

[Captioner] 20:49:01
DUTY FREIGHT 
TRANSPORT.

[Captioner] 20:49:01

>> Councilmember Shao:   THANK 


[Captioner] 20:49:04
YOU.
>> Mayor Mei:   SO JUST TO 


[Captioner] 20:49:07
CLARIFY REAL QUICKLY, TO LET YOU 
KNOW,

[Captioner] 20:49:10
 ACTC IS ALSO LOOKING AT 
THAT FORK

[Captioner] 20:49:14
 HYDROGEN IN TERMS OF 
EXPLORATION FOR THE NEXT PHASE

[Captioner] 20:49:15
 
IN PARTNERSHIP WITH OTHER 


[Captioner] 20:49:19
ORGANIZATIONS LIKE ABC.
NEXT

[Captioner] 20:49:23
 IS VICE MAYOR COX FOR 
CLARIFYING QUESTIONS

[Captioner] 20:49:25
.
>> Vice Mayor Cox:   THANK YOU, 


[Captioner] 20:49:28
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE 
PRESENTATION AND A LOT OF 


[Captioner] 20:49:29
DETAIL.
AND IT IS VERY ROBUST.


[Captioner] 20:49:32
I THINK IT IS ALSO A LITTLE ON 
THE AGGRESSIVE SIDE.


[Captioner] 20:49:35
AND I THINK AS I'M TRYING TO 
LOOK AT IT AS LOOK

[Captioner] 20:49:38
ING LIKE 
FOCUSING ON YOUR GAME

[Captioner] 20:49:41
 PLAN, WHAT 
WOULD KIND OF HELP, I MEAN YOU 


[Captioner] 20:49:44
HAVE A LAUNDRY LIST, EITHER IT'S 
CITY

[Captioner] 20:49:47
 RESPONSIBILITY DRIVEN OR 
COMMUNITY LEVEL ACTIONS.


[Captioner] 20:49:50
WHAT WOULD REALLY HELP IS TO 
KIND OF GET A PHASE BECAUSE

[Captioner] 20:49:53
 
YOU'RE TALKING OVER A THREE YEAR 


[Captioner] 20:49:55
PLAN.
IF YOU WOULD LOOK AT WHAT ARE 


[Captioner] 20:49:58
REALLY THE PRIORITIES IN THIS 
FIRST YEAR, WHAT'S THE PRIORITY 


[Captioner] 20:50:02
SECOND YEAR, THIRD YEAR,

[Captioner] 20:50:04
 BUT 
SHOWING LIKE WHAT IS GOING TO BE 


[Captioner] 20:50:07
EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED OR 
ESTIMATED TO BE COMPLETED

[Captioner] 20:50:10
, AND 
THOSE THAT WILL BE JUST IN FROG 


[Captioner] 20:50:14
OR JUST PENDING.
BECAUSE THERE'S JUST A LOT

[Captioner] 20:50:17
 
THAT -- TO TRY TO FOCUS ON.


[Captioner] 20:50:20
AND I KNOW WE COULDN'T DO IT 
ALL, 

[Captioner] 20:50:23
WE JUST APPROVED THE ONE 
YEAR BUDGET RIGHT FOR THIS 


[Captioner] 20:50:26
COMING YEAR.
BUT IT GOES BEYOND THAT AND 


[Captioner] 20:50:29
DEPENDING ON THINGS GO, THERE 
COULD BE

[Captioner] 20:50:32
 SOME ADJUSTMENTS MADE 
BUT IN AN

[Captioner] 20:50:36
 ACTION GAME PLAN 
STANDPOINT FROM ACTIVITIES LIST

[Captioner] 20:50:37

LISTED IN YOUR GAME PLAIB PLAN I 


[Captioner] 20:50:40
WOULD LIKE TO SEIZE THAT A 
LITTLE MORE CLEAR.


[Captioner] 20:50:43
I KNOW IT IS A CATCHALL OF A

[Captioner] 20:50:44
 
LITTLE BIT OF EVERYTHING TO BE 


[Captioner] 20:50:47
LISTED AND YOU LEFT NO GRAPES

[Captioner] 20:50:48
 TO 
BE FOUND THERE.


[Captioner] 20:50:52
SO BUT WHAT I WOULD THINK IT 
WOULD JUST HELP IN KIND

[Captioner] 20:50:55
 OF 
UNDERSTANDING WHERE WE'RE GOING, 


[Captioner] 20:50:58
WHAT ARE WE PLANNING TO 
ACCOMPLISH AND BEING REALISTIC

[Captioner] 20:51:02
.
BECAUSE WHEN YOU LOOK AT SOME OF 


[Captioner] 20:51:06
THE INSTALLATION FOR HVAC 
SYSTEMS

[Captioner] 20:51:10
 SOME PARTS OF NOT 
AVAILABLE AND YOU STILL HAVE

[Captioner] 20:51:11
 
PART SHORTAGES GOING ON THAT 


[Captioner] 20:51:15
WOULD CHANGE THE LOOK OF BEING 
ABLE TO IMPLEMENT IT IN A TIME 


[Captioner] 20:51:18
PERIOD YOU'RE SHOWING THREE 
YEARS, IT COULD TAKE LONGER 


[Captioner] 20:51:21
DEPENDING ON THE MODEL, 
DEPENDING ON THE COST AND THAT

[Captioner] 20:51:22
 
SORT OF THING.


[Captioner] 20:51:25
SO THAT'S MY FIRST COMMENT.
AND

[Captioner] 20:51:28
 TRYING TO GET SOME 
CLARIFICATION IN TERMS OF THAT

[Captioner] 20:51:32
.
ANOTHER PART THAT I WANTED TO --

[Captioner] 20:51:34
 
I WAS GLAD TO HEAR A LOT ABOUT 


[Captioner] 20:51:37
YOUR VENDOR AND PARTICIPATION

[Captioner] 20:51:40
, 
ACTUALLY IT IS LIKE YOUR 


[Captioner] 20:51:43
EXPANSION OF THE COMMUNITY OF AN 
EDUCATION

[Captioner] 20:51:46
 OF GROWN AND 
SUSTAINABILITY INITIATIVES.


[Captioner] 20:51:49
WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IS THAT 
AS WE OPERATE AND ROLL IT OUT

[Captioner] 20:51:52
 TO 
THE COMMUNITY, IN TERMS OF GET

[Captioner] 20:51:53

GETTING UNDERSTANDING OF SOME 


[Captioner] 20:51:56
SORT OF GREEN PURCHASING BUT 
ADDING ALL THE DIFFERENT 


[Captioner] 20:51:59
ELEMENTS.
BECAUSE I DIDN'T EVEN SEE, I 


[Captioner] 20:52:02
KNOW THERE'S THE AB 1383, BUT I 
DIDN'T SEE YOU MENTIONING

[Captioner] 20:52:05
 THE AB 
6

[Captioner] 20:52:08
61.
WHICH IS ALSO JANITORIAL 


[Captioner] 20:52:12
RECYCLED PAPER GOODS AND ALSO 
LOOKING

[Captioner] 20:52:15
 AT WOULD IT BE ANY TYPE 
OF FOOD SERVICE TYPE PROGRAM

[Captioner] 20:52:18
.
LIKE EVEN WE HAVE THE FREMONT

[Captioner] 20:52:20
 
EATS EVERY FRIDAY AND HOW IS 


[Captioner] 20:52:23
THAT GOING TO HELP US TO 
ELIMINATE THE WASTE THERE?

[Captioner] 20:52:26

AND WORKING WITH, YOU KNOW, 


[Captioner] 20:52:29
TRAINING SOME OF OUR -- EVEN THE 
FOOD

[Captioner] 20:52:32
 VENDOR TRUCKS, YOU KNOW 
PEOPLE THAT WORK IN THAT SPACE.


[Captioner] 20:52:35
BECAUSE THIS IS GOING ON FROM 
MAY NOW UNTIL THE

[Captioner] 20:52:38
 END OF OCTOBER 
AND THAT'S A WHOLE LOT

[Captioner] 20:52:41
 OF WASTE 
THAT NEEDS TO BE KIND OF 


[Captioner] 20:52:44
ADDRESSED AND I KNOW WE'RE, YOU 
KNOW,

[Captioner] 20:52:46
 TAKING CARE OF THAT AS 
PART OF THE CITY OF FREMONT 


[Captioner] 20:52:49
PROPERTY.
BUT JUST KIND OF SEEING HOW I 


[Captioner] 20:52:51
THINK THOSE ARE SOME 
OPPORTUNITIES I DIDN'T SEE 


[Captioner] 20:52:53
LISTED.
IT MAY BE UNDER YOUR GENERAL 


[Captioner] 20:52:57
STOP -- STOP WASTE INITIATIVE 
BUT KIND OF LIKE

[Captioner] 20:53:00
 ADD A LITTLE 
BIT MORE LIKE COULD BE PRESENTLY 


[Captioner] 20:53:03
DONE, VERSUS THREE YEARS DOWN 
THE LINE

[Captioner] 20:53:06
.
AND THEN ALSO, TRAINING THE 


[Captioner] 20:53:09
VENDORS, BECAUSE I DO BELIEVE 
THAT

[Captioner] 20:53:12
 THERE'S GOT TO BE AN 
EDUCATION PIECE AND

[Captioner] 20:53:14
 NOT ALL BIG 
COMPANIES THEY ARE ALREADY 


[Captioner] 20:53:17
DRIVING A LOT OF THIS ALREADY.
THEY HAVE THINGS IN PLACE.


[Captioner] 20:53:20
THEY HAVE CONTRACTS IN PLACE.
THEY ARE ROLLING IT OUT

[Captioner] 20:53:23
 AND 
TAKING DIFFERENT PHASES.


[Captioner] 20:53:26
BUT ALSO WHEN YOU ARE PARTNERING 
WITH THE FREMONT CHAMBER AND

[Captioner] 20:53:28
 ALL 
THE VENDORS THAT WOULD, YOU 


[Captioner] 20:53:31
KNOW, BE IN THESE DIFFERENT 
GROUPS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE 


[Captioner] 20:53:34
TALKED TO, THAT I THINK WE NEED 
SOME SPECIAL TRAINING

[Captioner] 20:53:37
 FOR THE 
VENDORS AND SUSTAIN

[Captioner] 20:53:39
ABILITY 
PURCHASING PROGRAM JUST SO THAT 


[Captioner] 20:53:43
THEY CAN GET CERTIFIED, THEY CAN 
KNOW WHAT WE LIKE

[Captioner] 20:53:46
, AND ALSO ANY 
HORIZONS THAT MAY COME THAT

[Captioner] 20:53:49
 WE 
MAY HAVE TO GET WAVERS FOR

[Captioner] 20:53:53
 WAIVERS FOR 
CERTIFICATIONS OR

[Captioner] 20:53:55
 SEEK NEW 
SOURCES FOR THAT.


[Captioner] 20:53:58
BUT I THINK THAT'S ANOTHER 
WIN-WIN

[Captioner] 20:54:01
 THAT COULD HELP US.
BECAUSE THERE ARE A LOT OF DAILY 


[Captioner] 20:54:04
SERVICES AND GOODS WE PROCURE 
DAILY, ESPECIALLY

[Captioner] 20:54:07
 THE COPY PAPER 
AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND THE 


[Captioner] 20:54:11
JANITORIAL PAPER PRODUCTS.
ANOTHER THING I WAS WONDERING 


[Captioner] 20:54:14
ABOUT AS YOU ARE LOOKING AT THE 
EMISSION GOALS

[Captioner] 20:54:17
, ARE YOU COUNTING 
HYBRID

[Captioner] 20:54:21
 CARS IN YOUR COUNT WITH 
GAS

[Captioner] 20:54:24
 AND EV?
SO SOME CARS THAT ARE HYBRID DO 


[Captioner] 20:54:27
NOT NEED TO BE CHARGED AT ALL 
BECAUSE THEY GOT A

[Captioner] 20:54:30
 RECHARGEABLE

[Captioner] 20:54:34
 
ELECTROPHOTOSTATIC BATTERY 


[Captioner] 20:54:38
INSIDE.
IT DOESN'T NEED TO HAVE

[Captioner] 20:54:40
 ANY -- 
IT IS A SESTLES SUSTAINING 


[Captioner] 20:54:44
SYSTEM.
JUST ASKING, ARE

[Captioner] 20:54:47
 THOSE I TEEN OF 
VEHICLES INCLUDED IN YOUR COUNT

[Captioner] 20:54:50
?
I WANT TO INCLUDE E VFORT/GAS 


[Captioner] 20:54:53
BUT IT USES LESS GAS DEPENDING 
IF YOU ARE ON THE

[Captioner] 20:54:58
 HIGHWAY VERSUS 
THE LOCAL STREET

[Captioner] 20:55:01
.
CAN YOU LET ME KNOW HOW THAT 


[Captioner] 20:55:04
COUNT IS INCLUDED IN YOUR GOALS?
>> THANK YOU FOR THE OTHER 


[Captioner] 20:55:07
COMMENTS.
FOR THE VEHICLES YOU KNOW WHAT 


[Captioner] 20:55:10
WE LOOK AT IS OVERALL FUEL 
EFFICIENCY OF

[Captioner] 20:55:13
 THE ENTIRE VEHICLE 
FLEET OWNED AND

[Captioner] 20:55:15
 BEING DRIVEN IN 
FREMONT.


[Captioner] 20:55:18
SO AS MORE EVs AND PLUG IN 
HYBRID

[Captioner] 20:55:22
S AND HYBRID ELECTRICS

[Captioner] 20:55:25
 AND 
HYBRID AND

[Captioner] 20:55:29
 CELL

[Captioner] 20:55:32
 ARE PURCHASED 
THAT IS A FACTOR THAT IS USED

[Captioner] 20:55:36
 TO 
CALCULATE

[Captioner] 20:55:41
 THE HOW MANY EVs ARE 
OWNED, PLUG IN

[Captioner] 20:55:44
 HYBRIDS, HI 
BRIDES ET CETERA AND

[Captioner] 20:55:47
 THE TREND 
IS TOWARDS THOSE VEHICLES AND 


[Captioner] 20:55:50
 AND 
AWAY

[Captioner] 20:55:54
 FROM CONVENTIONAL 
COMBUSTION VEHICLES

[Captioner] 20:55:55
.
>> Vice Mayor Cox:   THANK YOU 


[Captioner] 20:55:58
FOR THAT.
AS THE CITY HAS ALREADY 


[Captioner] 20:56:01
DEVELOPED THE TELEWORK, YOU ARE 
CALCULATING THOSE NUMBERS OF 


[Captioner] 20:56:04
EMISSIONS THAT ARE BEING SAVED.
FROM

[Captioner] 20:56:07
 THAT BACK AND FORTH IN THE 
COMMUNITY.

[Captioner] 20:56:09

>> IN TERMS OF OUR MUNICIPAL 


[Captioner] 20:56:12
OPERATIONS THAT'S KIND OF THE 
OVERALL TOTAL COMMUNITY 


[Captioner] 20:56:15
EMISSIONS.
BUT THEN WE ALSO PARSE OUT

[Captioner] 20:56:18
 OUR 
MUNICIPAL OPERATIONS TO LOOK AT, 


[Captioner] 20:56:21
YOU KNOW, WHAT SPECIFICALLY CAN 
WE DO WITHIN OUR OWN CITY 


[Captioner] 20:56:24
OPERATIONS TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE.
AND SO

[Captioner] 20:56:27
, YOU KNOW, WE CALCULATE 
EMPLOYEE COMMUTE AS PART OF

[Captioner] 20:56:30
 THE 
MUNICIPAL INVENTORY.


[Captioner] 20:56:33
AND THE TELEWORK POLICY WILL 
SIGNIFICANTLY

[Captioner] 20:56:36
 CONTRIBUTE TO 
REDUCTIONS IN EMPLOYEE COMMUTES

[Captioner] 20:56:37
.
>> Vice Mayor Cox:   OKAY.


[Captioner] 20:56:40
I HAD ANOTHER QUESTION.
I KNOW I'M GLAD TO SEE ABOUT

[Captioner] 20:56:42
 THE 
PARTNERSHIP BECAUSE I'M ONE OF 


[Captioner] 20:56:45
YOUR REPRESENTATIVES FOR THE 
EAST BAY COMMUNITY ENERGY.

[Captioner] 20:56:48

AND I APPRECIATE A LOT OF THE 


[Captioner] 20:56:51
PARTNERSHIPS THAT ARE HAPPENING.
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

[Captioner] 20:56:54
 I'M A 
LITTLE WEARY ABOUT IS THAT

[Captioner] 20:56:57
 WHEN 
WE AS THE GOVERNMENT MAY ENFORCE 


[Captioner] 20:57:01
AND MAKE IT MANDATORY THAT 
EVERYONE MUST CONVERT

[Captioner] 20:57:03
 TO 
RENEWABLE ENERGY, I MEAN THAT'S 


[Captioner] 20:57:06
IDEAL.
BUT I WANT US TO BE A LITTLE

[Captioner] 20:57:09
 
SENSITIVE ABOUT THAT.


[Captioner] 20:57:12
BECAUSE NOT EVERYBODY IS GOING 
TO CONVERT TO 100

[Captioner] 20:57:14
% FOR VARIOUS 
REASONS.


[Captioner] 20:57:17
EVEN THOUGH THERE IS A LOT OF 
GOOD BENEFIT.

[Captioner] 20:57:20

BUT I DON'T WANT US TO BE LIKE, 


[Captioner] 20:57:23
YOU KNOW, WE'RE KIND OF TAKING 
OVER AS THE ENFORCE

[Captioner] 20:57:27
ERS THAT MAKE 
IT MANDATORY FOR

[Captioner] 20:57:29
 PEOPLE.
AND JUST TO KIND OF WATCH THAT 


[Captioner] 20:57:32
KIND OF LANGUAGE OF WHEN YOU SAY 
OPT-OUT, ALL RESIDENTS

[Captioner] 20:57:35
 AND 
BUSINESSES, THAT MAY NOT BE 


[Captioner] 20:57:38
POSSIBLE.
>> RIGHT.


[Captioner] 20:57:40
>> Vice Mayor Cox:   AND 
REALISTIC, RIGHT?


[Captioner] 20:57:42
EVEN THOUGH WE COULD, YOU KNOW, 
SHARE THE BENEFITS IT COULD BE 


[Captioner] 20:57:46
ALL THE THINGS THAT FROM HEALTH 
TO BUSINESS TO

[Captioner] 20:57:49
 ECONOMICS ALL 
THOSE THINGS OF ARE GREAT

[Captioner] 20:57:52
 ARE GREAT.
BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE

[Captioner] 20:57:55
 WE KIND 
OF WATCH THAT LANGUAGE MAKING IT

[Captioner] 20:57:57
 
MANDATORY.


[Captioner] 20:58:00
>> WITH EAST BAY COMMUNITY 
ENERGY IT IS COMMUNITY CHOICE 


[Captioner] 20:58:03
ENERGY SO THE IDEA IS WE WOULD 
ESTABLISH RENEWAL

[Captioner] 20:58:06
 100 AS A 
BASELINE FOR EVERYBODY BUT 


[Captioner] 20:58:09
MEDIUM WOULD STILL HAVE THAT 
OPTION TO, YOU KNOW, CALL ABC

[Captioner] 20:58:12
E 
OR FILL A FORM OUT ONLINE

[Captioner] 20:58:15
 TO SAY 
NO I WANT TO STICK WITH RIGHT 


[Captioner] 20:58:19
CHOICE OR I DON'T WANT TO 
PARTICIPATE, I WANT TO BE

[Captioner] 20:58:20
 A PG&E 
CUSTOMER.


[Captioner] 20:58:23
THERE IS STILL A CHOICE THERE.
WE ARE

[Captioner] 20:58:26
 ESTABLISHING BY DEFAULT 
AS THE BASELINE

[Captioner] 20:58:28
 INSTEAD OF 
BRIGHT CHOICE.


[Captioner] 20:58:31
SO AND YOU KNOW WE CAN DO 
ANALYSIS

[Captioner] 20:58:33
, YOU KNOW, WHEN WE 
BRING THAT TOWARD TO COUNCIL TO 


[Captioner] 20:58:37
SHOW WHAT OPT-OUT OR DEFAULT 
OPTIONS

[Captioner] 20:58:39
 LOOK LIKE IN OTHER 
CITIES.


[Captioner] 20:58:42
ANOTHER THING TO AT THERE IS 
THAT IN EVERY CITY THAT HAS DONE

[Captioner] 20:58:44
 
THIS AS A CAMPAIGN, THEY HAVE 


[Captioner] 20:58:47
CHOSEN TO EXCLUDE THE CARE

[Captioner] 20:58:50
 AND 
FER AFORT CUSTOMERS WHICH ARE 


[Captioner] 20:58:53
THE LOW INCOME CUSTOMERS AND THE 
CUSTOMERS THAT HAVE MEDICAL 


[Captioner] 20:58:55
NEEDS.
FROM THAT OPT-UP.


[Captioner] 20:58:59
>> Vice Mayor Cox:   RIGHT.
I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE WHEN WE 


[Captioner] 20:59:02
STATE THIS THAT THERE IS OTHER 
ALTERNATIVES.


[Captioner] 20:59:05
BECAUSE IT IS LIKE THE WAY THAT 
IT IS WRITTEN I KNOW THAT YOU 


[Captioner] 20:59:08
DIDN'T MEAN IT BASED ON YOUR 
EXPLANATION JUST NOW BUT THE WAY 


[Captioner] 20:59:11
IT LOOKED LIKE IT WAS JUST LIKE 
WE'RE GOING TO DEMAND THAT.


[Captioner] 20:59:14
AND JUST TO BE CAREFUL THAT 
THERE IS SOME

[Captioner] 20:59:17
 OTHER OPTIONS THAT 
IT'S UP

[Captioner] 20:59:20
 TO THE RESIDENTS TO MAKE 
THAT DECISION.


[Captioner] 20:59:23
AND NOT ENFORCE IT AS -- IT MAY

[Captioner] 20:59:25
 
BE PART OF YOUR GOAL BUT YOU 


[Captioner] 20:59:28
ALSO KIND OF GOT TO BE 
EXPLAINING A LITTLE BIT MORE THE

[Captioner] 20:59:29
 
DETAIL BEHIND THAT PART.


[Captioner] 20:59:33
THAT'S JUST FOR EXAMPLE THAT

[Captioner] 20:59:36
 HAD 
JUMPED OUT AT ME THERE.


[Captioner] 20:59:39
ANOTHER PART WAS I THOUGHT WE 
WERE GOING OUT FOR SOLICITATION 


[Captioner] 20:59:42
FOR CHARGING STATIONS FOR THE 
PORTS

[Captioner] 20:59:44
.
FOR ELECTRIFICATION.


[Captioner] 20:59:47
IS THAT SOLICITATION STARTED YET 
OR --


[Captioner] 20:59:50
>> WITH ABCE?
>> Vice Mayor Cox:   NO, NO, 


[Captioner] 20:59:53
THIS IS EV JUST IN GENERAL FOR 
THE CITY

[Captioner] 20:59:57
, WE WERE GOING OUT FOR 
SOME SORT OF

[Captioner] 20:59:59
 EV.
>> FOR OUR OWN FLEET.


[Captioner] 21:00:01
>> Vice Mayor Cox:   THAT WAS 
PART OF WHAT WAS IN THE BUDGET 


[Captioner] 21:00:04
FOR THIS COMING YEAR.
>> SO YES, WE

[Captioner] 21:00:08
 WILL BE WORKING ON 
THOSE

[Captioner] 21:00:11
 INFRASTRUCTURE UPGRADES 
FOR OUR OWN CITY EV FLEET.

[Captioner] 21:00:13

AND WE'LL BE LOOKING FOR SOME 


[Captioner] 21:00:16
ALTERNATIVE OPTIONS IN THE SHORT 
TERM WHERE WE WOULDN'T

[Captioner] 21:00:19
 NECESSARY 
NEED ELECTRICAL INFRASTRUCTURE 


[Captioner] 21:00:22
UPGRADES TO GET D CRFORT FAST 
CHARGING IN PLACE.

[Captioner] 21:00:26

THERE IS BATTERY BOOSTED EV 


[Captioner] 21:00:29
CHARGING OPTIONS THAT ARE BEING 
CONSIDERED NOW BY PUBLIC WORKS

[Captioner] 21:00:30
.
>> Vice Mayor Cox:   YOU ARE 


[Captioner] 21:00:32
BUILDING A STRATEGY FIRST BEFORE 
YOU GO OUT FOR THE RFP 


[Captioner] 21:00:36
SOLICITATION SO YOU'RE KIND OF 
DOING YOUR OWN ANALYSIS, SO

[Captioner] 21:00:38
 
THAT'S WHY I KIND OF NEEDED THAT 


[Captioner] 21:00:42
CHART TO KIND OF KNOW WHICH ONES 
WE'RE KIND OF HITTING NOW OR

[Captioner] 21:00:44
 IN 
SIX MONTHS OR A YEAR DOWN THE 


[Captioner] 21:00:47
LINE FOR THAT.
AND ALSO, I KNOW

[Captioner] 21:00:50
 THAT EAST BAY 
ENERGY HAS ALSO TALKED ABOUT THE

[Captioner] 21:00:52
 
INDUCTION COOKING AND THEY HAD 


[Captioner] 21:00:55
THINGS THAT WERE OFFERED FOR 
PEOPLE THAT WOULD BE INTERESTED

[Captioner] 21:00:58
 
IN USING THOSE TYPE OF QUALITY

[Captioner] 21:01:01
 
PRODUCTS TO REDUCE THE EMISSIONS 


[Captioner] 21:01:04
THAT, YOU KNOW, IT STARTS KIND 
OF LIKE IN THE HOME AND THEN IT 


[Captioner] 21:01:08
CAN SPREAD IN TERMS OF REDUCING 
THE EMISSIONS.

[Captioner] 21:01:09

AND THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING ELSE 


[Captioner] 21:01:13
LIKE IF THERE'S A SEPARATE -- 
YOU MAY HAVE AN

[Captioner] 21:01:16
 ENVIRONMENTAL 
WEB PAGE BUT SOMETHING ELSE THAT 


[Captioner] 21:01:19
KIND OF HELPED THE RESIDENTS 
UNDERSTAND SOME OF THE

[Captioner] 21:01:22
 POINTS 
THAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACHIEVE AND 


[Captioner] 21:01:25
HOW THEY CAN PLAY A PART IN IT.
AND IT DOESN'T HAVE

[Captioner] 21:01:28
 TO BE A LIST 
OF YOUR TOP 20 BUT MAYBE THE

[Captioner] 21:01:31
 TOP 
THREE THAT COULD BE

[Captioner] 21:01:34
 MOST 
IMPACTFUL AND THEN LEAD FROM 


[Captioner] 21:01:38
THERE AS A PHASE TWO-THREE

[Captioner] 21:01:40
, 
DEPEND ON EACH YEAR AND TIMING.


[Captioner] 21:01:43
BUT SOMETHING I'VE SEEN OTHER 
CITIES HAVE THEIR OWN WEBSITE 


[Captioner] 21:01:46
AND THEY DIRECT THE RESIDENTS TO 
BE ABLE TO SAY HOW CAN YOU

[Captioner] 21:01:49
 HELP 
OUT ON EMITIGATIONS, YOU KNOW, 


[Captioner] 21:01:51
LIKE THE PLANNING AND THINGS 
LIKE THAT WHICH WE KIND OF 


[Captioner] 21:01:55
TALKED ABOUT ALREADY IN PREVIOUS 
CITY COUNCIL MEETINGS.

[Captioner] 21:01:56

BUT JUST THE OTHER THINGS 


[Captioner] 21:02:00
BECAUSE THAT COULD BE A ROLE 
THAT OUR YOUNG PEOPLE PLAY,

[Captioner] 21:02:03
 OF 
ALL AGES PLAY A PART IN PLANTING 


[Captioner] 21:02:06
TREES AND LIKE THAT.
BUT HOW IT CAN ALL TIE TOGETHER 


[Captioner] 21:02:08
FOR THE COMMON GOOD OF OUR 
COMMUNITY.


[Captioner] 21:02:11
>> JUST A QUICK NOTE ON THAT.
WE

[Captioner] 21:02:14
 DID LAUNCH

[Captioner] 21:02:18
 THE FREMONT GREEN 
CHALLENGE, BACK

[Captioner] 21:02:21
 IN 2016, WE BETA 
TEST

[Captioner] 21:02:23
ED THAT WITH THE COMMUNITY 
CONTACT SOLUTIONS.


[Captioner] 21:02:26
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF CITIES 
THAT ARE USING THAT CONTACT NOW 


[Captioner] 21:02:29
AND AS A WAY TO ENGAGE 
HOUSEHOLDS TO UNDERSTAND WHAT 


[Captioner] 21:02:32
THEIR OPTIONS ARE NOR REDUCING 
THEIR ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT

[Captioner] 21:02:35
.
AND WE'VE BUILT IN ALL THE 


[Captioner] 21:02:37
DIFFERENT INCENTIVE PROGRAMS 
THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO HELP THEM 


[Captioner] 21:02:41
DO THAT.
>> Vice Mayor Cox:   OKAY, 


[Captioner] 21:02:44
THAT'S GOOD BUT I STILL SAY, YOU 
KNOW, THERE ARE SOME OTHER PARTS

[Captioner] 21:02:47
 
THAT COULD BE DIRECTED TO HELP

[Captioner] 21:02:49
.
AND I JUST DON'T SEE THE TIE IN 


[Captioner] 21:02:52
JUST YET FROM LOOKING FROM THE 
OUTSIDE IN.


[Captioner] 21:02:55
BUT THAT'S ALL OF MY QUESTIONS 
FOR RIGHT NOW.


[Captioner] 21:02:58
THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 21:03:01
I SEE ANOTHER QUESTION FROM 
COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL.


[Captioner] 21:03:06
>> Councilmember Campbell:   I 
THINK I'M GOING TO

[Captioner] 21:03:10
 WAIT AND 
PERHAPS DISCUSS IT LATER BECAUSE 


[Captioner] 21:03:14
WE DID TALK ABOUT IT A LITTLE 
BIT.

[Captioner] 21:03:15

AND THAT WAS AIR TRAFFIC BUT WE 


[Captioner] 21:03:17
CAN TALK ABOUT THAT LATER.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 21:03:19
>> Mayor Mei:   OKAY.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 21:03:21
AND AT THIS TIME I THINK I WANT 
TO OPEN THE PUBLIC COMMENT 


[Captioner] 21:03:24
PERIOD.
I HAVE QUESTIONS BUT I'LL MAKE 


[Captioner] 21:03:27
THEM DURING MY OTHER COMMENTS AT 
THE SAME TIME BECAUSE I THINK 


[Captioner] 21:03:29
OUR PUBLIC HAS BEEN WAITING FOR 
SOME TIME.


[Captioner] 21:03:32
DO WE HAVE SPEAKER CARDS?
>> The Clerk:  

[Captioner] 21:03:36
 WE DO.
SPEAKER CARDS AND ON ZOOM.

[Captioner] 21:03:37

HOW MANY MINUTES?


[Captioner] 21:03:38
>> Mayor Mei:   HOW MANY DO WE 
HAVE?


[Captioner] 21:03:41
>> The Clerk:   A TOTAL OF THREE 
SPEAKERS AT THE MOMENT.


[Captioner] 21:03:44
>> Mayor Mei:   WE'LL DO THREE 
MINUTES EACH.


[Captioner] 21:03:46
>> The Clerk:   THE FIRST 
SPEAKER IS JOHN HINES.


[Captioner] 21:03:52
>> HELLO EVERYONE.
>> Mayor Mei:   WELCOME JOHN.

[Captioner] 21:03:54

>> THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION GOT 


[Captioner] 21:03:58
ROLLING ABOUT 200 YEARS AGO.
IT WAS

[Captioner] 21:04:01
 POWERED FROM THE GET GO 
FROM FOSSIL FUELS AND IT

[Captioner] 21:04:05
 MADE 
TREMENDOUS STANDARDS IN THE

[Captioner] 21:04:08
 
WORLD, AROUND THE GLOBE, ONE OF 


[Captioner] 21:04:11
THE EARLIEST ADVANCES WAS MAKING 
CLOTHING MORE

[Captioner] 21:04:14
 AFFORDABLE.
AT THE TIME MOST PEOPLE HAD 


[Captioner] 21:04:17
EXACTLY ONE OUTFIT THE ONE THEY 
WERE WEARING WHICH

[Captioner] 21:04:20
 WAS PATCHED 
AND HEAVILY REPATCHED.


[Captioner] 21:04:23
FOSSIL FUELS GAVE US ALL THE 
CLOTHING CHOICES WE'RE

[Captioner] 21:04:25
 
ACCUSTOMED TO TODAY.


[Captioner] 21:04:28
AMONG THE OTHER AREAS OF GAINS 
WAS FOOD PRODUCTION.


[Captioner] 21:04:31
FOR MUCH OF HISTORY PEOPLE

[Captioner] 21:04:33
 
STRUGGLE TO FIND ENOUGH CALORIES 


[Captioner] 21:04:36
TO STAY ALIVE.
HERE SOME OF US STRUGGLE WITH

[Captioner] 21:04:37
 
HAVING FOUND TOO MANY.


[Captioner] 21:04:41
BUT MOST OF THE WORLD HAS NOT 
REACHED

[Captioner] 21:04:44
 THAT STAGE AND THEY 
WOULD MUCH RATHER HAVE OUR 


[Captioner] 21:04:47
PROBLEMS THAN THEIRS.
THEY WOULD NOT BE HELD BACK FROM 


[Captioner] 21:04:50
RAISING THEIR LIVING STANDARDS 
THE SAME WAY WE DID

[Captioner] 21:04:52
 WITH FOSSIL 
FUELS.


[Captioner] 21:04:55
CHINA HAS ALREADY PASSED US IN 
THEIR CARBON E

[Captioner] 21:04:58
MISSIONS AND 
THEY'RE BUILDING ONE COAL FIRED

[Captioner] 21:05:00
 
PLANT AFTER ANOTHER.


[Captioner] 21:05:03
INDIA IS ON TRACK TO SURPASS US 
BY

[Captioner] 21:05:07
 2030 AND MANY OTHER 
OCCURRENCE ARE FOLLOWING

[Captioner] 21:05:09
 SIMILAR 
PLANS BECAUSE THE PEOPLE WANT TO 


[Captioner] 21:05:12
LIVE BETTER.
NOTE THE ONLY TIME WE DON'T BUY

[Captioner] 21:05:16
 
A BARREL OF

[Captioner] 21:05:19
 OIL OR TON OF COAL 
THAT MAKES IT

[Captioner] 21:05:22
 BETTER FOR SOMEONE 
ELSE TO BURN IT WHICH THEY

[Captioner] 21:05:25
 WILL.
EVERY BIT OF CARBON WE DON'T

[Captioner] 21:05:27
 
TOSS UP INTO THE AIR SOMEONE 


[Captioner] 21:05:30
ELSE DOES.
THE ACTUAL EFFECT OF POLICIES 


[Captioner] 21:05:33
LIKE THESE ON SPEAKER CARBON IS

[Captioner] 21:05:39
 ATMOSPHERIC CARBON 
IS NOTHING.

[Captioner] 21:05:42

DEDICATED FOLLOWERS OF FASHION 


[Captioner] 21:05:46
WHICH IS PROBABLY WORTH 
SOMETHING SO LONG AS WE ARE RICH

[Captioner] 21:05:49
 
ENOUGH TO FORWARD IT.

[Captioner] 21:05:52
 AFFORD IT.
STOP FOR A MOMENT TO

[Captioner] 21:05:54
 THINK OF 
SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS WE 


[Captioner] 21:05:57
COULD HAVE DONE WITH THAT MONEY.
BECAUSE THESE ARE OPPORTUNITIES 


[Captioner] 21:06:00
WE WILL FORGO.
THESE ARE NEEDS THAT WILL

[Captioner] 21:06:03
 BE 
SACRIFICED AT THE AM TAR OF GAI

[Captioner] 21:06:06
A 
WITH ALL THE EFFICACY OF 


[Captioner] 21:06:09
THROWING

[Captioner] 21:06:13
 VIRGINS INTO VOLCANOES.
AS LONG AS

[Captioner] 21:06:16
 SOMEONE ELSE WILL 
BURN EVERY SCRAP OF

[Captioner] 21:06:19
 CARBON WE 
DON'T.


[Captioner] 21:06:22
OUR EFFECT ON

[Captioner] 21:06:24
 ATMOSPHERIC CARBON 
IS ZERO.


[Captioner] 21:06:28
WE'RE GOING TO DO SOME OF THIS 
SO I ASK

[Captioner] 21:06:32
 YOU KEEP THE WAYSOF 
LOSS TO A MINIMUM.


[Captioner] 21:06:35
WE WILL SEE SOME IMPROVEMENTS IN 
AIR QUALITY WITH REDUCING

[Captioner] 21:06:36
 
VEHICLE EXHAUST BUT ASIDE FROM 


[Captioner] 21:06:40
THAT I THINK THIS IS A MISGUIDED 
INITIATIVE BASED

[Captioner] 21:06:43
 ON WEAK 
PREMISES WITH ALMOST NO

[Captioner] 21:06:44
 REAL 
BENEFIT.


[Captioner] 21:06:46
THANK YOU.
>> The Clerk:   THE NEXT SPEAKER 


[Captioner] 21:06:50
IS ON ZOOM.
IT IS LISA DA

[Captioner] 21:06:53
NS.
>> Mayor Mei:   WELCOME, LISA.

[Captioner] 21:06:55

>> HI, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.


[Captioner] 21:06:58
MY FIRST -- YES, LISA DANS

[Captioner] 21:07:00
 HAVE 
DISTRICT 4 IN FREMONT.


[Captioner] 21:07:03
THIS IS SO IMPORTANT.
YOU KNOW, CLIMATE IS OUR

[Captioner] 21:07:05
 FUTURE 
AND I LOOK TOWARD MY FUTURE AND 


[Captioner] 21:07:09
I WORRY BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, WE 
SEE ALREADY THINGS GETTING BAD

[Captioner] 21:07:13
 
WITH WILDFIRES, AND

[Captioner] 21:07:15
 THINGS THAT 
IN THE PRICE OF THE WORLD AND WE 


[Captioner] 21:07:19
KNOW IT IS GOING TO GET WORSE.
SO I JUST WANTED TO KIND OF 


[Captioner] 21:07:21
GROUND US IN LIKE WHY THIS 
MATTERS.


[Captioner] 21:07:24
BECAUSE WE HAVE BEEN TALKING A 
LOT ABOUT DETAILS AND THAT IS

[Captioner] 21:07:25
 
ALL CRITICAL.


[Captioner] 21:07:28
AND THIS IS WHY.
I WANT TO SPECIFICALLY

[Captioner] 21:07:32
 THANK 
RACHEL DE FRA

[Captioner] 21:07:35
NCO, THE CITY OF 
FREMONT IS LUCKY TO HAVE YOU

[Captioner] 21:07:37
.
THIS IS A HUGE AMOUNT OF WORK.


[Captioner] 21:07:40
I'M ESPECIALLY EXCITED ABOUT THE 
CEQA PORTION OF

[Captioner] 21:07:44
 THIS CLIERMT 
ACTION PLAN BECAUSE STREAMING

[Captioner] 21:07:46
 
CLIMATE POSITIVE PROJECTS IS 


[Captioner] 21:07:49
CRITICAL TO ACHIEVE OUR GOALS 
AND MAKE SURE

[Captioner] 21:07:52
 OUR ENVIRONMENTAL 
LAWS ARE WORKING WITH US INSTEAD 


[Captioner] 21:07:55
OF AGAINST US.
AND I DO HELP WE WILL IMPLEMENT 


[Captioner] 21:07:58
THESE FRESH GOALS THAT ARE 
LISTED AND I CHALLENGE THE CITY 


[Captioner] 21:08:01
TO KEEP THE CLIMATE LENS IN 
EVERY DECISION THAT WE MAKE.


[Captioner] 21:08:04
WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BUDGET 
LET'S MAKE SURE

[Captioner] 21:08:06
 WE'RE FULLY 
FUNDING THESE PROGRAMS.


[Captioner] 21:08:09
FOR EXAMPLE WITH TREES I KNOW IT 
WILL TAKE STAFF TO

[Captioner] 21:08:11
 PLANT AND 
MAINTAIN THAT MANY TREES SO WE 


[Captioner] 21:08:14
NEED TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE THAT 
KIND OF STAFF FUNDING.


[Captioner] 21:08:17
WITH LAND USE, WE DO HAVE AND I 
THINK

[Captioner] 21:08:19
 COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN KIND 
OF ALLUDED TO THIS AND THERE IS 


[Captioner] 21:08:22
A NOTE ABOUT IT IN THE PLAN AS 
WELL THAT WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY 


[Captioner] 21:08:26
TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GASES BY 
BUILDING MORE IN-

[Captioner] 21:08:29
FILL HOUSING 
THAT IS MORE AFFORDABLE WHICH 


[Captioner] 21:08:32
WOULD ALLOW MORE PEOPLE TO STAY 
IN FREMONT RATHER THAN MOVING 


[Captioner] 21:08:35
FURTHER AWAY AND HAVING 
SUPER-COMOOUTLE

[Captioner] 21:08:38
COMMUTES.
AS FAR AS PARKING I

[Captioner] 21:08:41
 THINK IT WAS 
MENTIONED THAT IT WAS A STRETCH 


[Captioner] 21:08:44
GOAL TO NOT HAVE PARKING 
MINIMUMS NEAR TRANSIT.


[Captioner] 21:08:47
THAT IS REALLY STATE LAW AB 127, 
I MISSED

[Captioner] 21:08:50
 IF THERE WAS A NUANCE 
THAT WAS PUSHING US

[Captioner] 21:08:53
 FURTHER BUT 
I'D SAY LET'S BE ALL THE WAY,

[Captioner] 21:08:56
 
I'D LOVE FOR FREMONT TO BE A 


[Captioner] 21:08:59
LEADER, THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT 
HOMES AND BUSINESSES CAN'T

[Captioner] 21:09:04
 BUILD 
PARKING, THEY'RE NOT FORCE

[Captioner] 21:09:06
ED TO 
BUILD MORE PARKING THAN THEY 


[Captioner] 21:09:08
NEED.
THANK YOU FOR COUNCILMEMBER 


[Captioner] 21:09:12
KASSAN TO CALL OUT DAY TO DAY 
DECISIONS ON

[Captioner] 21:09:15
 CLIMATE IMPACTS.
I ALSO WANT TO GIVE A

[Captioner] 21:09:18
 SHOUT OUT 
TO COUNCILMEMBER SHAO FOR

[Captioner] 21:09:21
 A, 
NATIONAL CARBON TAX.


[Captioner] 21:09:24
THAT WOULD BE THE BEST, NATIONAL 
CARBON TAMP,

[Captioner] 21:09:27
 THAT IS A POLICY WE 
COULD ABSOLUTELY ADOPT.


[Captioner] 21:09:30
THANK YOU, PLEASE LET'S PUSH OUR 
CLIMATE AGENDA AS FAR AS

[Captioner] 21:09:31
 WE 
POSSIBLY CAN.


[Captioner] 21:09:36
>> The Clerk:   THANK YOU.
THE NEXT PERSON OR THE LAST

[Captioner] 21:09:39
 
SPEAKER IS KELLY

[Captioner] 21:09:42
 ABREW.


[Captioner] 21:09:49
>> SO TALK ABOUT GASOLINE 
STATIONS OVERALL NUMBER OF 


[Captioner] 21:09:52
GASOLINE STATIONS IN THE U.S. 
HAS BEEN DECLINING FOR MANY 


[Captioner] 21:09:55
YEARS DUE TO VARIOUS FACTORS 
LIKE INCREASED COMPETITION,

[Captioner] 21:09:56
 
STRICTLIER ENVIRONMENTAL 


[Captioner] 21:10:00
REGULATIONS, SHRINKING

[Captioner] 21:10:01
 PROFIT 
MARGINS AND SO ON.


[Captioner] 21:10:04
SO FOR EXAMPLE, WALGREEN'S

[Captioner] 21:10:07
 NEAR 
IRVINGTON HIGH SCHOOL, THAT USED 


[Captioner] 21:10:11
TO BE A GAS STATION, GOT PAVED 
OVER.

[Captioner] 21:10:14

HOW ABOUT MISSION PROGRAM NEAR 


[Captioner] 21:10:17
KENNEDY HIGH SCHOOL, IT'S A 
CHRISTMAS TREE LOT NOW

[Captioner] 21:10:20
, EVERY 
CHRISTMAS TIME, LOTS OF 


[Captioner] 21:10:24
CHRISTMAS TREES ON THE EMPTY 
LOT, ON THE CORNER

[Captioner] 21:10:26
 OF STEVENSON, 
BLACOW.


[Captioner] 21:10:29
WHEN THIS CITY ITSELF HAD THINGS 
UNDER ITS

[Captioner] 21:10:33
 CONTROL TALKING ABOUT 
FLEET VEHICLE REPLACEMENT, A LOT

[Captioner] 21:10:35
 
OF PEOPLE SAY WHEN YOU REPLACE 


[Captioner] 21:10:38
YOUR OLD CAR AND BUY A FANCY

[Captioner] 21:10:40
 NEW 
CAR YOU ARE WASTING A LOT OF 


[Captioner] 21:10:43
RESOURCES AND IF THE OLD CAR 
RUNS YOU SHOULD BE

[Captioner] 21:10:46
 MAYBE RUNNING 
IT TO BE MORE

[Captioner] 21:10:49
 ENVIRONMENTAL.
IF YOU THINK THAT THE CITY CAN 


[Captioner] 21:10:52
REDUCE ITS CARBON EMISSIONS BY 
PLACING ALL THE CARS,

[Captioner] 21:10:55
 THE 
AVERAGE LIFETIME OF THOSE CARS 


[Captioner] 21:10:58
IS WHAT, TEN YEARS, FIVE YEARS, 
WHATEVER IT IS.


[Captioner] 21:11:01
AND IF YOU REPLACE THEM SOONER 
YOU'RE GETTING --

[Captioner] 21:11:03
 YOU'RE USING 
MORE RESOURCES.


[Captioner] 21:11:06
AND THEN THERE IS

[Captioner] 21:11:10
 SO RELIANCE ON 
MOON SHOT TECHNOLOGIES,

[Captioner] 21:11:13
 WE HAVE 
SO MANY TECHNOLOGIES, IF WE

[Captioner] 21:11:16
 WANT 
CO 2, WE WOULD HAVE WALKING

[Captioner] 21:11:21
 
E-BIKES, LITTLE DINK YEAH NONSEX

[Captioner] 21:11:23

NONSEXY TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE 


[Captioner] 21:11:26
REALLY CHEAPER AND EASIER, YOU 
KNOW,

[Captioner] 21:11:29
 STREETS IN CHINA ARE FULL 
OF E-

[Captioner] 21:11:32
BIKES.
AND OUR DEPARTMENT HEADS, THEY

[Captioner] 21:11:35
 
TREAT THESE ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES 


[Captioner] 21:11:39
IT IS AN ACCESSORY ADD ON, 
ANOTHER BELL AND WHISTLE

[Captioner] 21:11:42
.
LIKE ALL THE OTHER BELLS AND 


[Captioner] 21:11:45
WHISTLES THAT OTHER DEPARTMENTS 
HAVE LOADED ON THEM.


[Captioner] 21:11:48
LEGAL COMPLIANCE, DIVERSITY, 
EQUITY AND HR ISSUES.


[Captioner] 21:11:52
HEALTH AND SAFETY.
JUST LITTLE, YOU KNOW.


[Captioner] 21:11:55
THAT'S NOT THEIR MAIN THING BUT 
IT'S SOMEBODY ELSE COMES

[Captioner] 21:11:58
 IN AND 
KIND OF LOADS THE EXTRA STUFF ON

[Captioner] 21:12:00
 
THEM FOR THEM TO DO.


[Captioner] 21:12:03
AND, YOU KNOW, OF COURSE RIGHT 
WAY TO DO THIS IS TO HAVE

[Captioner] 21:12:05
 THEM 
DO IT THEMSELVES AND NOT HAVE IT 


[Captioner] 21:12:08
COME FROM OUTSIDE.
INTERNALLY DRIVEN.


[Captioner] 21:12:11
AND MY MOST -- MY

[Captioner] 21:12:14
, YOU KNOW, 
NITTY-GRITTY SUGGESTION HERE IN 


[Captioner] 21:12:17
THIS CITY IS IF YOU LOOK AROUND 
AT THESE CITY VEHICLES, A LOT

[Captioner] 21:12:19
 OF 
THE WORKERS DRIVE VEHICLES AND 


[Captioner] 21:12:21
THEY ARE IDLING.
THEY PARK THEM THEY GET OUT OF 


[Captioner] 21:12:24
THE CAR OR TRUCK AND THEY'RE 
IDLING.


[Captioner] 21:12:27
THE U.S. AND I SAY POSTAL

[Captioner] 21:12:30
 
SERVICE HAS FIGURED OUT HOW

[Captioner] 21:12:33
 TO 
FIX THIS, YOU NEVER HAVE

[Captioner] 21:12:37
 THE 
POSTAL SERVICE HAVE

[Captioner] 21:12:41
 THE POSTAL 
WORKER

[Captioner] 21:12:44
 HAVE THE TRUCK I'D LINGS

[Captioner] 21:12:47
.
BUT LOTS OF TECHNOLOGIES, LOTS 


[Captioner] 21:12:50
OF IDLING GOING ON THANKS.
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU SO 


[Captioner] 21:12:53
MUCH.
AND AT THIS TIME, I'M GOING TO 


[Captioner] 21:12:57
CLOSE THE PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD 
FOR THIS ITEM AND I'LL BRING IT 


[Captioner] 21:13:00
BACK TO COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL.
FOR YOUR COMMENTS

[Captioner] 21:13:03
.
COMMENTS.


[Captioner] 21:13:10
 YOUR COMMENTS, THANK YOU.
>> Councilmember Campbell:  

[Captioner] 21:13:13
 AM 
I FORGETTING HOW TO DO THIS

[Captioner] 21:13:15
?
>> Mayor Mei:   YOU'RE ON.


[Captioner] 21:13:16
>> Councilmember Campbell:   
IT'S GETTING LATE.


[Captioner] 21:13:19
WE HAD A LONG CONVERSATION ABOUT 
AIR TRAFFIC AND THE IMPACT

[Captioner] 21:13:23
 OF 
THE DIESEL JET FUEL THAT GOES

[Captioner] 21:13:26
 
ACROSS OUR CITIES FROM

[Captioner] 21:13:29
 THE 
AIRPLANES AND I KNOW THAT'S NOT 


[Captioner] 21:13:32
A CAL NET 4 BECAUSE WE'RE 
LOOKING AT GROUND,

[Captioner] 21:13:35
 GROUND 
TRAFFIC IN TERMS OF CARBON 


[Captioner] 21:13:40
FOOTPRINT.
SO EXCUSE ME MY QUESTION IS, ARE 


[Captioner] 21:13:43
WE PARTNERING WITH OR ARE WE 
WORKING WITH

[Captioner] 21:13:47
 ANY OF THE

[Captioner] 21:13:50
 AIR 
TRAFFIC PEOPLE TO TALK

[Captioner] 21:13:53
 ABOUT THE 
IMPACT OF THIS IN FREMONT

[Captioner] 21:13:58
?
>> NOT CURRENTLY

[Captioner] 21:14:01
.
YOU KNOW, THERE ARE

[Captioner] 21:14:03
 SIGNIFICANT 
EFFORTS HAPPENING ESPECIALLY OUT 


[Captioner] 21:14:07
OF SFO AROUND IMPROVEMENTS IN 
JET FUEL

[Captioner] 21:14:09
, EMISSIONS ASSOCIATED 
WITH IT.


[Captioner] 21:14:12
AND DECREASING EMISSIONS 
ASSOCIATED WITH AIR

[Captioner] 21:14:16
 TRAFFIC.
IT'S A CONSUMPTION BASED 


[Captioner] 21:14:19
EMISSION, YOU KNOW, IF PEOPLE 
ARE FLYING, THAT'S PART OF THEIR 


[Captioner] 21:14:23
OWN FOOTPRINT.
BUT YEAH, IT'S

[Captioner] 21:14:26
 SOMETHING THAT WE 
CAN THINK ABOUT

[Captioner] 21:14:30
 AND, YOU KNOW, 
ENCOURAGE PEOPLE AT THE

[Captioner] 21:14:31
 
INDIVIDUAL LEVEL TO CONSIDER, 


[Captioner] 21:14:35
YOU KNOW, LOOKING INTO CLEAN

[Captioner] 21:14:38
ER 
PLANES AS THEY BECOME

[Captioner] 21:14:41
 AVAILABLE, 
EMISSIONS OFFSETS OR THE PLANE 


[Captioner] 21:14:44
TRIPS IN THE MEANTIME.


[Captioner] 21:14:47
>> Councilmember Campbell:   I 
THINK I WAS CONCERNED ABOUT IT 


[Captioner] 21:14:51
BECAUSE WE TALKED ABOUT HOW WE 
DID THE

[Captioner] 21:14:54
 MILES TRAVELED AND HOW 
THAT IMPACTS CARBON

[Captioner] 21:14:56
 AND HOW 
WE'RE TRYING TO KEEP PEOPLE OFF 


[Captioner] 21:15:00
THE ROADS.
AND I'M WONDERING IF WE'RE 


[Captioner] 21:15:03
REALLY WORKING -- BECAUSE THE 
JET FUEL COMES DOWN

[Captioner] 21:15:06
, SO IT 
DEFINITELY IMPACTS OUR AIR

[Captioner] 21:15:08
 
QUALITY.


[Captioner] 21:15:11
AND THEY HAD A WHOLE THING WITH 
THE AIRPORT DOWN IN

[Captioner] 21:15:14
 SAN JOSE, 
WHERE THE FAMILIES WERE COMING 


[Captioner] 21:15:18
OUT KIDS WERE GETTING ASTHMA 
BECAUSE

[Captioner] 21:15:21
 IF THEY LIFT CLOSE TO 
THE AIRPORT THERE WAS HEALTH 


[Captioner] 21:15:23
RISK INVOLVED IN THAT.
AND I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT'S 


[Captioner] 21:15:25
SOMETHING THAT CITIES ARE TAKING 
ON.


[Captioner] 21:15:28
BUT THE

[Captioner] 21:15:32
 CITY OF SAN JOSE 
CERTAINLY DID BEGIN TO TAKE THAT

[Captioner] 21:15:34
 
ON AS A CONCERN ABOUT THE AIR 


[Captioner] 21:15:38
QUALITY IN SAN JOSE.


[Captioner] 21:15:46
>> Dan Schoenholz:   THANK YOU 
FOR THE COMMENTS AND THE 


[Captioner] 21:15:50
QUESTION COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL.
THERE ISN'T MUCH FOCUS ON

[Captioner] 21:15:52
 AIR 
TRANSPORTATION BECAUSE WE HAVE 


[Captioner] 21:15:55
LITTLE CONTROL OVER THAT.
AS RACHEL SAID,

[Captioner] 21:15:58
 IF WE COULD 
INFLUENCE PEOPLE FOR AIR TRAVEL 


[Captioner] 21:16:01
THAT WOULD HAVE SOME EFFECT BUT 
IT ISN'T QUANTIFIABLE

[Captioner] 21:16:03
.
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 21:16:05
DO YOU HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS 
OR COMMENTS?


[Captioner] 21:16:08
THANK YOU.
NEXT IS COUNCILMEMBER SHAO.


[Captioner] 21:16:11
>> Councilmember Shao:   THANK 
YOU, MADAM MAYOR.


[Captioner] 21:16:14
I JUST HAVE SOME COMMENTS.
YOU KNOW, I REALLY

[Captioner] 21:16:18
 APPRECIATE 
JOHN HINES COMMENT

[Captioner] 21:16:21
 ABOUT THE 
IMPORTANCE OF GLOBAL 


[Captioner] 21:16:26
COLLABORATION IN COMBATING 
CARBON EMISSION

[Captioner] 21:16:28
.
ALSO I JUST LEARNED THAT IN YEAR 


[Captioner] 21:16:31
2020, THE WILDFIRE IN

[Captioner] 21:16:33
 CALIFORNIA 
WHICH A LOT OF PEOPLE STILL 


[Captioner] 21:16:37
REMEMBER, ARE REMINDED RECENTLY 
BY

[Captioner] 21:16:40
 THE ORANGE SKY

[Captioner] 21:16:43
 IN NEW YORK 
CITY.


[Captioner] 21:16:46
HOW WE ARE EXPERIENCING 2020.
IN THAT YEAR,

[Captioner] 21:16:49
 THE WILDFIRE GIVE

[Captioner] 21:16:51
 
CARBON EMISSION THAT COUNTS FOR 


[Captioner] 21:16:54
30% OF THE WHOLE

[Captioner] 21:16:58
 STATE CARBON 
EMISSION THAT YEAR

[Captioner] 21:17:01
.
AND IMAGINE THE SCALE

[Captioner] 21:17:04
.
AND EVEN LIKE 2021,

[Captioner] 21:17:08
 THE WILDFIRE 
WOULD COUNT FOR 20

[Captioner] 21:17:11
% OF THE STATE 
CARBON EMISSION

[Captioner] 21:17:14
.
SO WE'RE LOOKING AT THE BIGGEST

[Captioner] 21:17:15
 
TARGETS.


[Captioner] 21:17:18
I'M GLAD THAT AT LEAST IN OUR 
PLAN

[Captioner] 21:17:22
 WE DO HAVE THE WILDFIRE 
REDUCTION

[Captioner] 21:17:25
 IN MIND.
AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT

[Captioner] 21:17:29
.
SO THAT'S MY FIRST COMMENT.


[Captioner] 21:17:32
AND SECOND COMMENT IS

[Captioner] 21:17:35
 THAT WHILE 
I REPRESENT THE

[Captioner] 21:17:38
 CITY ON STOP 
WASTE IN ALAMEDA COUNTY

[Captioner] 21:17:42
, WE 
EMPHASIZE ON

[Captioner] 21:17:45
 THE ORGANIC WASTE 
REDUCTION

[Captioner] 21:17:47
, ESPECIALLY THE FOOD 
WASTE REDUCTION.


[Captioner] 21:17:50
YOU MAY NOT REALIZE HOW MUCH 
FOOD WE WASTE

[Captioner] 21:17:53
 EVERY YEAR.
AND IT SHOULDN'T HAVE

[Captioner] 21:17:56
 BEEN SENT 
TO THE LANDFILL.


[Captioner] 21:18:00
RATHER, IT SHOULD BE MADE BETTER 
USE.

[Captioner] 21:18:03

SO RECENTLY, WE JUST

[Captioner] 21:18:06
 PRESENTED 
AWARDS TO TWO OAKLAND

[Captioner] 21:18:10
 
ORGANIZATIONS FOR MAKING BEST 


[Captioner] 21:18:13
USE OF THE SURPLUS OF ORGANIC

[Captioner] 21:18:14
 
FOOD.


[Captioner] 21:18:17
SO THAT ON ONE HAND

[Captioner] 21:18:20
, THE WASTE 
REDUCTION

[Captioner] 21:18:23
 IS ACHIEVED.
ON THE OTHER HAND,

[Captioner] 21:18:26
 THE FOOD IS 
SENT TO THE HANDS OF REALLY

[Captioner] 21:18:28
 THE 
NEEDY.


[Captioner] 21:18:31
SO I WOULD APPRECIATE THAT THE 
CITY WILL

[Captioner] 21:18:35
 CONTINUE TO, BY 
WORKING WITH NOT

[Captioner] 21:18:38
 ONLY THE HUMAN 
SERVICES DEPARTMENT,

[Captioner] 21:18:40
 BUT ALSO 
EXISTING NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS 


[Captioner] 21:18:44
LIKE THE TRICITY VOLUNTEERS 
BANK, FOOD BANK,

[Captioner] 21:18:48
 TO REALLY TRY 
TO REDUCE THE

[Captioner] 21:18:51
 FOOD WASTE IN THE

[Captioner] 21:18:54
 
CITY AND TRY TO ALSO

[Captioner] 21:18:58
 PROVIDE 
PRECIOUS RESOURCES TO

[Captioner] 21:19:01
 THE LOCAL 
INCOME FAMILIES AS WELL AS

[Captioner] 21:19:04
 LOW

[Captioner] 21:19:07
 
INCOME FAMILIES AS WELL AS THE 


[Captioner] 21:19:11
HOMELESS PEOPLE.
THIS IS SOMETHING I WOULD

[Captioner] 21:19:14
 LIKE 
TO SEE MORE PLAN IN THE NEAR 


[Captioner] 21:19:18
FUTURE.
THE THIRD THING IS I'M VERY GLAD 


[Captioner] 21:19:21
ON BEHALF OF STOP WASTE I 
PRESENTED AN AWARD TO

[Captioner] 21:19:25
 OUR FUSD 
INCLINE CLUB

[Captioner] 21:19:28
 
CLEAN CLUB, AMERICAN

[Captioner] 21:19:31
 HIGH, WHICH 
ACTUALLY WAS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF 


[Captioner] 21:19:34
THE SCHOOL DISTRICT WIDE EFFORT 
TO

[Captioner] 21:19:38
 USE COMPOST AND HAVE SCHOOL 
GARDENS THROUGHOUT THE

[Captioner] 21:19:41
 DISTRICT.
I STILL REMEMBER WHEN I WAS ON 


[Captioner] 21:19:44
THE SCHOOL BOARD I VISITED A LOT 
OF SCHOOLS AND SAW

[Captioner] 21:19:48
 THOSE SCHOOL 
GARDENS

[Captioner] 21:19:52
, YOU KNOW, IN MY 
FIRSTHAND EXPERIENCE.

[Captioner] 21:19:55

AND I REALLY COMMEND THEIR 


[Captioner] 21:19:58
EFFORTS OVER THE YEARS, AND I 
BELIEVE IT IS

[Captioner] 21:20:02
 THE COLLABORATION 
BETWEEN THE CITY AND THE

[Captioner] 21:20:05
 SCHOOL 
DISTRICT THAT

[Captioner] 21:20:07
 HELPED ACHIEVE THE 
GOAL.


[Captioner] 21:20:10
SO I LOOK FORWARD TO FURTHER 
COLLABORATION BETWEEN THE

[Captioner] 21:20:14
 FUSD 
AND THE CITY AND TRY TO

[Captioner] 21:20:18
 REALLY 
NOT ONLY PROMOTE

[Captioner] 21:20:22
 AWARENESS OF 
SUSTAINABILITY,

[Captioner] 21:20:23
 AND 
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION, 


[Captioner] 21:20:27
REDUCTION OF CARBON EMISSION 
MORNING OUR

[Captioner] 21:20:30
 STUDENTS, BUT ALSO 
TRY

[Captioner] 21:20:37
 
AMONG OUR STUDENTS BUT ALSO MAKE 


[Captioner] 21:20:40
FUSD A BIG PARTNER IN THE JOINT 
EFFORT TO ACHIEVE OUR GOAL.


[Captioner] 21:20:43
THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei:  

[Captioner] 21:20:45
 THANK YOU.
NEXT IS COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN.


[Captioner] 21:20:49
>> Councilmember Salwan:   THANK 
YOU MADAM MAYOR.


[Captioner] 21:20:52
AND JUST TO CLARIFY OUR FUR

[Captioner] 21:20:54
 VIEW 
TODAY JUST TO GIVE FEEDBACK 


[Captioner] 21:20:57
THERE IS NO COUNCIL ACTION AT 
THIS TIME.

[Captioner] 21:21:00

>> Dan Schoenholz:   THE ONLY 


[Captioner] 21:21:03
ACTION WE ARE ASKING FOR IS 
DIRECTION TO COUNCIL TO PUT THIS 


[Captioner] 21:21:05
OUT TO THE PUBLIC FOR COMMENT.
>> Councilmember Salwan:   WELL, 


[Captioner] 21:21:07
GREAT.
I THINK THIS IS A GREAT START 


[Captioner] 21:21:10
AND I LOOK FORWARD TO THE ROBUST 
DISCUSSION.


[Captioner] 21:21:13
I MEAN THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT WE 
DO NEED TO DEAL

[Captioner] 21:21:16
 WITH.
IT'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT 


[Captioner] 21:21:19
REQUIRES OUR URGENT ATTENTION.
AND I APPRECIATE THE EFFORT

[Captioner] 21:21:22
 THAT 
YOU GUYS ARE DOING AND I LOOK 


[Captioner] 21:21:25
FORWARD TO THE ENGAGEMENT 
PROCESS AND I THINK IT WILL COME 


[Captioner] 21:21:28
BACK TO US FOR A FINAL VOTE, IS 
THAT CORRECT?


[Captioner] 21:21:31
AND THEN LATER HOPEFULLY WE'LL 
HAVE SOME

[Captioner] 21:21:33
 IMPLEMENTS MEASURES 
THAT WE CAN ACT ON TO FURTHER 


[Captioner] 21:21:35
CHIP AWAY AT THE CARBON 
EMISSIONS.


[Captioner] 21:21:38
GREAT, THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 21:21:41
NEXT IS COUNCILMEMBER KENG AND 
THEN I HAVE MY COMMENTS, TOO

[Captioner] 21:21:43
.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 21:21:45
>> Councilmember Keng:   THANK 
YOU VERY MUCH, MADAM MAYOR.


[Captioner] 21:21:48
MY QUICK QUESTION IS JUST WHAT 
ARE SOME OF THE ENGAGE

[Captioner] 21:21:50
MENTS THAT 
ARE BEING PLANNED RIGHT NOW ONCE 


[Captioner] 21:21:54
IT'S BEING PUBLISHED TO THE 
PUBLIC

[Captioner] 21:21:57
?
>> WHAT TYPE OF PUBLIC

[Captioner] 21:22:00
 
ENGAGEMENT ARE WE GOING TO DO?


[Captioner] 21:22:03
>> Councilmember Keng:   RIGHT.
>> FOR PUTTING IT OUT FOR PUBLIC 


[Captioner] 21:22:04
COMMENT?
>> Councilmember Keng:   I KNOW 


[Captioner] 21:22:07
WE ALREADY HAD SOME WORKSHOPS 
AND GETTING FEEDBACK IN THE LAST 


[Captioner] 21:22:11
COUPLE OF YEARS AND NOW THAT WE 
HAVE A DRAFT, WHAT KIND OF

[Captioner] 21:22:13
 
ADDITIONAL ENGAGEMENTS ARE WE 


[Captioner] 21:22:16
PLANNING NOW?
>> YES, SO WE'RE GOING TO 


[Captioner] 21:22:19
RELEASE THE DRAFT FOR THE PUBLIC 
TO PROVIDE COMMENTS ON

[Captioner] 21:22:22
 THROUGH 
MY FREMONT PLATFORM.


[Captioner] 21:22:25
SO WE'LL HAVE A SERIES OF 
QUESTIONS THAT PEOPLE

[Captioner] 21:22:26
 CAN 
PARTICIPATE IN.


[Captioner] 21:22:29
WE'LL HAVE AN OPEN

[Captioner] 21:22:32
 DISCUSSION, 
FORUM FOR PEOPLE TO

[Captioner] 21:22:35
, YOU KNOW, 
POST QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS, AND 


[Captioner] 21:22:37
OTHER PEOPLE CAN COMMENT ON 
THOSE.


[Captioner] 21:22:40
AND THEN ALSO WE'LL ALSO HAVE A 
PLACE FOR PEOPLE

[Captioner] 21:22:42
 TO ASK 
QUESTIONS FOR STAFF TO RESPOND 


[Captioner] 21:22:44
TO.
>> Dan Schoenholz:   I WOULD 


[Captioner] 21:22:47
JUST ADD THAT WE ARE ADVERTISING 
WIDELY THE AVAILABILITY OF

[Captioner] 21:22:48
 THAT 
FORUM.


[Captioner] 21:22:51
SO WE'RE USING SOCIAL MEDIA, 
WE'RE USING OUR

[Captioner] 21:22:54
 MAILING LIST.
IT'S SORT OF ALL THE CITY'S 


[Captioner] 21:22:57
COMMUNICATION PLATFORMS TO DRIVE 
PEOPLE TO THAT ONE PLACE TO 


[Captioner] 21:23:00
LEAVE COMMENTS.
>> Councilmember Keng:   


[Captioner] 21:23:02
WONDERFUL.
I WAS JUST GOING TO ASK WHAT 


[Captioner] 21:23:05
KIND OF VEHICLES WE ARE 
UTILIZING, PERFECT, THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 21:23:08
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.
SO I'LL CLOSE ON SOME OF MY 


[Captioner] 21:23:11
COMMENTS.
I JUST WANTED TO ECHO AND I 


[Captioner] 21:23:14
APPRECIATE THAT WE HAD GOTTEN 
SOME FEEDBACK FROM THE VINYL 


[Captioner] 21:23:17
SUSTAINABILITY COMMISSION.
I KNOW THAT'S ITEM

[Captioner] 21:23:21
 6 AF AND THEY

[Captioner] 21:23:24
 
WERE GIVING US SOME DIRECTION ON

[Captioner] 21:23:27
  
OUTREACH, WHETHER IT'S ENGAGING 


[Captioner] 21:23:30
THE BUSINESS SECTOR IN 
PARTICULAR OR HOW THE PLAN COULD 


[Captioner] 21:23:33
BE MORE SUCCESSFULLY OUTREACHED 
IN TERMS OF ROBUST IDEAS.


[Captioner] 21:23:36
THEY HAD SOME SUGGESTIONS ON HOW 
THE

[Captioner] 21:23:39
 COMMISSIONERS FELT THEY 
COULD COMMENT ON THE PROPOSED 


[Captioner] 21:23:41
AREAS.
AND SO THE OTHER THINGS WHICH I 


[Captioner] 21:23:44
THINK IS MUCH APPRECIATED.
WE HAVE OUR GREEN CHALLENGE

[Captioner] 21:23:47
 WEB 
PAGE AND THEN ALSO OUR REGULAR 


[Captioner] 21:23:50
GREEN CHALLENGE NEWSLETTER WHICH 
DOES A PRETTY ROBUST

[Captioner] 21:23:53
 JOB AND 
HOPEFULLY PEOPLE ARE SEEING 


[Captioner] 21:23:55
THAT.
FOR THOSE WHO DON'T KNOW, IF YOU 


[Captioner] 21:23:58
HAVEN'T SEEN THE GREEN CHALLENGE 
NEWSLETTER YOU CAN SIGN UP FOR 


[Captioner] 21:24:01
THAT.
WHICH DOES REGULARLY

[Captioner] 21:24:04
 PROVIDE THE 
INSIGHTS, AND I WAS JUST LOOKING

[Captioner] 21:24:06
 
AT THE LAST ISSUE THAT CAME OUT 


[Captioner] 21:24:09
A FEW DAYS AGO.
IT TALKED ABOUT OUR CLIMATE

[Captioner] 21:24:13
 PLAN 
PROPOSAL DRAFT, IT TALKS ABOUT

[Captioner] 21:24:15
 
DIFFERENT PROGRAMS LIKE THE BAY 


[Captioner] 21:24:19
RUN, DIFFERENT PROGRAMS IN THE 
PAST WE'VE HIGHLIGHT

[Captioner] 21:24:22
ED, WE 
TALKED ABOUT THE CARROT AND 


[Captioner] 21:24:25
STICK METHOD GETTING PEOPLE TO 
ADOPTIVE AND ONE OF THE THINGS

[Captioner] 21:24:29
 
THAT EAST BAY

[Captioner] 21:24:32
 CLEAN ENERGY DOES, 
THEY HAVE QUARTERLY CONTESTS

[Captioner] 21:24:35
 FOR 
THEIR RECIPES AND THE LAST ONE 


[Captioner] 21:24:38
WAS A SWEET ONE, A RECIPE TO 
MAKE I GUESS

[Captioner] 21:24:42
 BLUEBERRY PANCAKES.
THEY HAVE DIFFERENT IDEAS AND I 


[Captioner] 21:24:45
KNOW OUR STUDENTS HAVE BEEN 
ACTIVELY

[Captioner] 21:24:48
 GEAMED IN THE PAST AND 
OUR ENVIRONMENTAL

[Captioner] 21:24:51
 SUSTAINABILITY 
COMMISSIONER.


[Captioner] 21:24:53
I DO APPRECIATE OUR 
COUNCILMEMBERS TALKING ABOUT THE 


[Captioner] 21:24:57
ADOPTION OF GOING TO ROOUNL 100.


[Captioner] 21:25:00
 RENEWABLE 
100.


[Captioner] 21:25:02
THERE IS AN ADJUSTMENT IN TERMS 
OF COST AND THAT IS ONE OF THE 


[Captioner] 21:25:06
THINGS THAT WE HAD TAKEN INTO 
CONSIDERATION BECAUSE OF THE 


[Captioner] 21:25:09
PANDEMIC BUT SINCE THAT TIME I 
WAS LOOKING AT SOME OF THE 


[Captioner] 21:25:12
REPORTS THAT THEY HAVE OUT NOW 
FROM EAST BAY COMMUNITY

[Captioner] 21:25:13
 ENERGY 
WHICH IS ACTUALLY GOING TO BE 


[Captioner] 21:25:17
GOING THROUGH A NAME CHANGE TO 
BEING CALLED AVA

[Captioner] 21:25:19
 BECAUSE THEY 
HAVE ADOPTED MORE PEOPLE NOT 


[Captioner] 21:25:22
ONLY FROM ALAMEDA COUNTY BUT 
ALSO FROM THE VALLEY.


[Captioner] 21:25:24
THAT WILL BE GOING THROUGH A 
NAME CHANGE.


[Captioner] 21:25:27
ONE OF THE REASONS I WANTED TO 
HIGHLIGHT

[Captioner] 21:25:30
 IT IS WE ARE LOOKING 
AT THE COST

[Captioner] 21:25:34
 FOR RESIDENTIAL 
BILLS AND SMALL

[Captioner] 21:25:36
 COMMERCIAL AND 
LARGE COMMERCIAL.


[Captioner] 21:25:39
IN PARTICULAR THE RENEWABLE 100 
PREMIUM IT HAS A GREAT REDUCTION

[Captioner] 21:25:42
 
IN TERMS OF THE PROPOSED COST 


[Captioner] 21:25:44
PER RESIDENTIAL USE.
I THINK IT WAS ORIGINALLY ABOUT 


[Captioner] 21:25:47
THREE QUARTERS OF ONE CENT

[Captioner] 21:25:48
 PER 
KILOWATT.


[Captioner] 21:25:52
AND NOW IT'S ONE QUARTER OF ONE

[Captioner] 21:25:54
 
CENT AS WE MOVE FORWARD IN 2023, 


[Captioner] 21:25:58
2024, AFTER JULY.
AND SO THOSE TYPES OF THINGS

[Captioner] 21:25:59
 
WILL AFFECT SOME OF OUR DECISION 


[Captioner] 21:26:02
MAKING.
BECAUSE I DEFINITELY CONCUR THAT 


[Captioner] 21:26:06
IT'S SOMETIMES HARD TO FORCE 
SOMEONE TO MAKE THE ADOPTION.


[Captioner] 21:26:09
BUT IF YOU'RE ABLE TO SEE THAT 
THERE IS ALREADY

[Captioner] 21:26:12
 SOME FINANCIAL 
NERVE AS WELL AS

[Captioner] 21:26:14
 SOME IMPACTS IN 
TERMS OF, YOU KNOW, 


[Captioner] 21:26:17
CONSIDERATIONS THAT YOU SAID FOR 
THOSE WHO ARE AT

[Captioner] 21:26:20
 FINANCIAL RISK 
FOR CARE AND FER

[Captioner] 21:26:23
A FOR THOSE WHO 
MAKE SENSE IN TERMS OF LOOKING 


[Captioner] 21:26:25
AT THAT.
I ALSO APPRECIATE THE COMMENT 


[Captioner] 21:26:29
ABOUT STOP WASTE AND THE ORGANIC 
FOODS AND WE HAVE

[Captioner] 21:26:30
 STRONG 
PARTNERSHIPS AND BEING THAT THE 


[Captioner] 21:26:33
SCHOOLS HAVE SO MUCH CONSUMPTION 
OF FOOD SO DO

[Captioner] 21:26:36
 WE AS A CITY.
SO THE OPPORTUNITIES I KNOW THEY

[Captioner] 21:26:38
 
WORKED AND THERE WAS A CHALLENGE 


[Captioner] 21:26:40
LAST YEAR WITH THE RESTAURANTS, 
I HOPE WE CONTINUE THAT BECAUSE 


[Captioner] 21:26:44
WE JUST HAD RESTAURANT WEEK THIS 
YEAR AND WHEN WE TALK

[Captioner] 21:26:46
 ABOUT 
RESTAURANTS AND WASTE THERE IS 


[Captioner] 21:26:48
AN OPPORTUNITY TO SEE HOW WE CAN 
REDUCE THAT.


[Captioner] 21:26:51
I KNOW WE HAVE PARTNERED WITH 
FARMERS MARKETS TO

[Captioner] 21:26:54
 SEE IF THERE 
ARE OPPORTUNITIES BECAUSE RATHER 


[Captioner] 21:26:57
THAN HAVING THOSE DISPOSEOF AND 
I'VE EVEN SEEN IN SOME

[Captioner] 21:27:00
 CITIES 
THEY'VE TAKEN THE EXCESS

[Captioner] 21:27:04
 FRUIT, 
QUOTE UNQUOTE UGLY

[Captioner] 21:27:07
 42nd, TO 
PROCESS THAT INTO JUICE HE SO IT 


[Captioner] 21:27:10
DOESN'T GO INTO TOTAL WASTE.
IN FACT THIS WEEKEND I

[Captioner] 21:27:13
 THINK THE 
NILES HISTORICAL GARDENS AND 


[Captioner] 21:27:17
NURSERY GARDENS ALSO PROVIDE 
INSIGHTS AND CLASSES WITH LEAF 


[Captioner] 21:27:20
AND OTHER GROUPS TO ENCOURAGE 
OUR RESIDENTS TO BE ENGAGED.


[Captioner] 21:27:23
ON THE CITY SIDE I THINK ATHAT 
WHAT WE COULD DO

[Captioner] 21:27:26
 IS CONTINUE OUR 
POLICY AND WORKING WITH CLIMATE

[Captioner] 21:27:28
 
ACTION MAYORS AND THE AMERICAN 


[Captioner] 21:27:31
CITY SUMMIT BECAUSE WE CAN LOOK 
AT, I'M NOT ASHAMED TO RINSE

[Captioner] 21:27:35
 
REUSE RECYCLE AND REUSE IN TERMS 


[Captioner] 21:27:38
OF IDEAS AND SO THAT'S ONE OF 
THE KEY AREAS.

[Captioner] 21:27:40

AND SO I REALLY APPRECIATE THIS 


[Captioner] 21:27:43
OPPORTUNITY.
I ALSO WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT WHEN 


[Captioner] 21:27:46
IT COMES TO CONSTRUCTION AND 
BUILDING, ONE OF THE THINGS THAT 


[Captioner] 21:27:49
WE COULD IMPLEMENT AND I THINK 
WE'VE TRIED TO ENCOURAGE 


[Captioner] 21:27:52
ESPECIALLY FOR THE MULTITENANT 
UNITS, I HAD A CHANCE TO

[Captioner] 21:27:55
 GO ON A 
LITTLE BIT OF A WALKING VISIT 


[Captioner] 21:27:58
WITH A CO-HOUSING THAT WAS IN 
IRVINGTON THAT'S BEING

[Captioner] 21:27:59
 BUILT 
RIGHT NOW.


[Captioner] 21:28:02
BUT WHEN WE LOOK AT THESE 
HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES WITH MULTI

[Captioner] 21:28:05

MULTITENANT UNITS, WHETHER IT'S 


[Captioner] 21:28:08
THESE AGE WELL CENTERS OR 
THESE -- WE CAN ALSO

[Captioner] 21:28:11
 HAVE 
COMMUNITY GARDENS PUT IN, THAT 


[Captioner] 21:28:14
IS BEEN WELL RECEIVED TO HAVE 
LITTLE PLANTER

[Captioner] 21:28:18
 BOXES.
PART OF IT IS IN THE SCHOOLS, 


[Captioner] 21:28:20
COMMUNITY SCHOOL GUARANTEES AND 
WITHIN OUR SENIORS AND OTHER 


[Captioner] 21:28:24
MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY.
IN FACT WHEN WE HAD OUR

[Captioner] 21:28:26
 SENIOR 
AGE WELL ARE IN, THEY HAD A FAIR 


[Captioner] 21:28:29
ONE DAY, I SEE ONE OF OUR 
VETERANS THAT

[Captioner] 21:28:32
 BUILD PLANTER 
BOXES THAT ARE THE RIGHT

[Captioner] 21:28:35
 HEIGHT 
FOR SENIORS.


[Captioner] 21:28:38
MYSELF INCLUDED WE DON'T WANT TO 
BEND OVER AND HURT

[Captioner] 21:28:40
 YOUR BACK.
THAT WAS A HEIGHT APPROPRIATE 


[Captioner] 21:28:44
TYPES OF WAYS.
USING RENEWABLE AND

[Captioner] 21:28:47
 REPUNCH THAT 
WOOD TO BUILD PLANTER

[Captioner] 21:28:51
 BOXES.
SO THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS WE

[Captioner] 21:28:54
 
COULD DO TO ENCOURAGE TO WORK 


[Captioner] 21:28:57
WITH OUR COMMUNITY ACROSS MANY 
ORGANIZATIONS TO MAKE THAT 


[Captioner] 21:28:59
HAPPEN.
SO I'M REALLY EXCITED TO SEE THE 


[Captioner] 21:29:00
PROPOSALS THAT HAVE COME 
THROUGH.


[Captioner] 21:29:03
I KNOW THERE'S MUCH TO BE DONE.
I ALSO THINK THAT

[Captioner] 21:29:05
 NOT HERE IN 
OUR CITY BUT, YOU KNOW, 


[Captioner] 21:29:08
CERTAINLY ON A GLOBAL SCALE, THE 
COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE

[Captioner] 21:29:11
 BY ONE 
OF OUR SPEAKERS EARLIER IS TRUE.


[Captioner] 21:29:14
I MEAN WE ARE JUST PART OF THE 
OVERALL

[Captioner] 21:29:17
 SOLUTION, CALIFORNIA HAS 
61 PHILOSOPHY AND IDEAS AND 


[Captioner] 21:29:20
TRYING TO SHOVE IDEAS DOWN 
PEOPLE'S THROATS IS NOT THE

[Captioner] 21:29:24
 
EASIEST BUT WHEN YOU KEY COST

[Captioner] 21:29:25
 
SAVINGS AND ENVIRONMENTAL AND 


[Captioner] 21:29:28
BUILDING A BETTER FUTURE FOR OUR 
COMMUNITY IT CAN BE ENCOURAGING 


[Captioner] 21:29:32
BECAUSE I'VE SEEN THE IMPACT 
UNFORTUNATELY, AS WE ARE

[Captioner] 21:29:34
 GOING 
THROUGH ELECTRONIC WASTE FOR 


[Captioner] 21:29:38
EXAMPLE IN THE EU AND OTHER 
GROUPS, HOW MANY OF US HAVE

[Captioner] 21:29:40
 
CHANGED A CELL PHONE OR CHANGED 


[Captioner] 21:29:43
A COMPUTER OR TECHNOLOGY.
SO THOSE TYPES OF THINGS ARE

[Captioner] 21:29:46
 
ALSO THINGS I DON'T KNOW THAT WE 


[Captioner] 21:29:49
HAVE PUT INTO THE PLAN BUT 
E-WASTE IS

[Captioner] 21:29:52
 SOME OF THE THINGS WE 
SHOULD THINK ABOUT BECAUSE OF 


[Captioner] 21:29:54
THE MERCURY AND OTHER THINGS 
THAT ARE IN THERE.


[Captioner] 21:29:57
IN TERMS OF THE LONG TERM, WHEN 
WE UPGRADE OUR COMPUTERS

[Captioner] 21:29:58
 AND 
TECHNOLOGY MAKING SURE THAT 


[Captioner] 21:30:01
THOSE ARE BEING REPURPOSED.
I KNOW THAT IN SOME PLACES THEY

[Captioner] 21:30:05
 
HAVE REPURPOSED THOSE TO PROVIDE

[Captioner] 21:30:08
 
THOSE THOSE TO THOSE THAT CAN'T

[Captioner] 21:30:09
 
AFFORD IT.

TECHNOLOGY HAS BECOME ARCHAIC 
AND IT CAN BE REPURPOSED FOR

[Captioner] 21:30:14
 
SAFETY AND OTHER PURPOSES.

EVEN THINGS LIKE CLOTHING AND 
ALSO OUR GLASSES.

I APPRECIATE HOW SOME SERVICE 
ORGANIZATIONS REPURPOSE GLASS

DIRECTION.

[Captioner] 21:32:28
I JUST WANTED TO NOTE ONE OF THE 
QUESTIONS THAT CAME UP EARLIER 


[Captioner] 21:32:31
WAS ABOUT PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION 
AND THAT HAVING ACCESS OF IT IS 


[Captioner] 21:32:34
VERY IMPORTANT.
AND SO I KNOW THAT WE'VE HAD 


[Captioner] 21:32:37
SOME COMMENTS AND FEEDBACK AND 
TRYING TO ENGAGE AND

[Captioner] 21:32:40
 WORK WITH 
AC TRANSIT AS WELL AS BART

[Captioner] 21:32:43
.
AND SO WE'VE BEEN HAVING SOME 


[Captioner] 21:32:46
LISTENING TOURS WITHIN THE 
DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION, 


[Captioner] 21:32:49
WORKING WITH US AND SO WE 

[Captioner] 21:32:52
 HOPE 
TO CONTINUE THOSE.


[Captioner] 21:32:55
WE THINK THAT RIDERSHIP IS 
REALLY KEY FOR ANY SUCCESS OF

[Captioner] 21:32:58
 
PUBLIC TRANSIT BUT HAVING PUBLIC 


[Captioner] 21:33:01
TRANSPORTATION THAT'S 
AFFORDABLE, ACCESSIBLE AND ALSO 


[Captioner] 21:33:04
RELIABLE AND SAFE ARE KEY AREAS.
SO I JUST WANTED TO SHARE

[Captioner] 21:33:06
 THAT 
THAT WAS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT 


[Captioner] 21:33:09
WE HAD TALKED ABOUT AND WE HOPE 
TO CONTINUE AS WE LOOK AT

[Captioner] 21:33:12
