19:07:45 THERE'S A PROCLAMATION FOR APRIL 2022, ARTS AND CULTURAL CREATIVITY MONTH.

19:07:55 I BELIEVE ACCEPTING THIS PROCLAMATION WILL BE CONNIE  CHEW.

19:07:59 IF YOU COULD SHARE BRIEF COMMENTS, TWO TO THREE MINUTES, WE'RE HOPING TO GET 
19:08:04 THROUGH ALL THREE OF THEM HOPEFULLY BEFORE THE UPCOMING PUBLIC HEARING.

19:08:10 SO THIS IS ARTS CULTURE AND CREATIVITY MONTH.

19:08:14  WHEREAS, THE CITY OF FREMONT CELEBRATES THE ROLE THAT THE ARTS AND 
19:08:16 CREATIVITY PLAY IN HELPING US NAVIGATE THE PANDEMIC, AMPLIFY THE NEED FOR 
19:08:19 RACIAL EQUITY, AND HIGHLIGHT THE POWER OF THE ARTS TO CHANGE OUR LIVES FOR 
19:08:28 THE BETTER; AND WHEREAS, THE FREMONT CULTURAL ARTS COUNCIL WORKS IN 
19:08:30 PARTNERSHIP TO SUPPORT THE ARTS AND CREATIVITY IN FREMONT AS AN ESSENTIAL 
19:08:33 PART OF OUR THRIVING COMMUNITY THROUGH SERVICES INCLUDING ARTS SERVICES; AND 
19:08:37 WHEREAS, THE FREMONT CULTURAL ARTS COUNCIL PARTNERS LOCALLY WITH THE 
19:08:41 ALAMEDA COUNTY ARTS COMMISSION, THE COMMUNITY BUILDING NETWORK ALAMEDA 
19:08:49 COUNTY AND CITY-LEVEL ARTS PARTNERSHIP, AND THE ARTS EDUCATION INITIATIVE 
19:08:51 CREATE ALAMEDA COUNTY TO ADVANCE THE ARTS AND CREATIVITY IN OUR COUNTY; AND 
19:09:00 WHEREAS, ART, CULTURE, AND CREATIVITY MONTH IS THE ANNUAL STATEWIDE 
19:09:01 AWARENESS AND ADVOCACY EVENT THAT RECOGNIZES THE CRUCIAL ROLE OF ARTS, 
19:09:05 CULTURE, AND CREATIVITY IN THE LIVES OF EVERYONE IN CALIFORNIA. NOW, 
19:09:08 THEREFORE, ART, CULTURE, AND CREATIVITY MONTH OF APRIL IS THE ANNUAL STATEWIDE 
19:09:14 AWARENESS AND ADVOCACY EVENT THAT RECOGNIZES THE CRUCIAL ROLE OF ARTS 
19:09:18 CULTURE, AND CREATIVITY IN THE LIVES OF EVERYONE IN CALIFORNIA.

19:09:24 AND I KNOW WE RECOGNIZED THIS ALSO AT THE COUNTY LEVEL REGULARLY EVERY YEAR, 
19:09:26 AND WE'VE HAD MANY HONOREES THERE.

19:09:30 AND SO MS. CHEW, SHE'S THE VICE PRESIDENT OF FREMONT CULTURAL ARTS 
19:09:34 COUNCIL, AND I KNOW WE HAVE A VERY BIG COMMISSION TOO, SO IF YOU'D LIKE TO 
19:09:38 SHARE A FEW BRIEF COMMENTS.

19:09:42 >> YES, HELLO, MAYOR MEI, COUNCILMEMBER MEMBERS AND CITY STAFF.

19:09:48 I AM CONNIE CHEW, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE FREMONT ARTS COUNCIL KNOWN AS FCAC.

19:09:58 ALSO IN ATTENDANCE, I BELIEVE, IS JULIE GILSON, OUR PRESIDENT, AND 
19:10:01 REPRESENTATIVE OF FREMONT ARTS NOW.

19:10:07 FCAC SUPPORTS FREMONT ARTISTS AND ORGANIZATIONS IN OUR COMMUNITIES 
19:10:08 ENJOYMENT OF ART AND CULTURE IN ALL FORMS.

19:10:15 WE APPRECIATE YOUR PROCLAIMING APRIL 2022 AS ARTS CULTURE AND CREATIVITY 
19:10:16 MONTH.

19:10:22 SPECIAL THANKS TO COUNCILMEMBER TERESA COX FOR YOUR PROMPT REPLY TO MY 
19:10:26 REQUEST TO BRING THIS PROCLAMATION FORWARD TO THE CITY AND THE FULL 
19:10:26 COUNCIL.

19:10:31 I WAS VERY HAPPY TO LEARN THAT COUNCILMEMBER COX IS SUPPORTIVE OF THE 
19:10:35 ARTS BECAUSE OF HER BACKGROUND AS A MUSICIAN, WHICH HELPED HER IN MATH AND 
19:10:36 HER CAREER PATH.

19:10:43 ART IS OFTEN OVERLOOKED, BUT WE KNOW THERE ARE MANY WAYS IN WHICH ART MAY 
19:10:44 HELP INDIVIDUALS IN THE COMMUNITY.

19:10:49 ALAMEDA COUNTY AND MANY OTHER JURISDICTIONS IN CALIFORNIA HAVE 
19:10:54 PROCLAIMED APRIL AS ARTS CULTURE AND CREATIVITY MONTH IN RECOGNITION THAT 
19:11:00 ART IS ESSENTIAL, AND RESULTS IN NURTURING AND SUPPORTING CREATIVITY.

19:11:10 EVEN GOVERNOR NEWSOM SHOWED HIS SI PORT OF THE ARTS BY SIGNING A SENATE BILL 
19:11:13 TO ADVANCE CALIFORNIA'S CREATIVE WORKFORCE ACT OF 2021.

19:11:21 A PROGRAM WHICH ADDRESSES ECONOMIC RECOVERY, CULTURAL EQUALITY AND JOB 
19:11:23 OPPORTUNITY IN THE ARTS, CULTURE AND CREATIVE INDUSTRIES.

19:11:31 CALIFORNIA WAS THE FIRST STATE TO PASS A CREATIVE WORKFORCE BILL.

19:11:35 GOVERNOR NEWSOM IS ALSO INCLUDING ARTS AND CULTURE IN HIS CURRENT PROPOSED 
19:11:35 STATE BUDGET.

19:11:39 THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME AND SUPPORT OF THE ARTS AS AN IMPORTANT 
19:11:41 ROLE IN OUR FREMONT COMMUNITY.

19:11:44 NOW I ACTUALLY HAVE A LITTLE ASK.

19:11:50 JULIE GILSON, I BELIEVE, IS IN ATTENDANCE AND IF POSSIBLE, MAY YOU 
19:11:54 UNMUTE HER SO THAT SHE CAN BRIEFLY MAKE A QUICK STATEMENT AS WELL?

19:12:05 SHE MIGHT BE THE FREMONT -- THERE SHE IS, I BELIEVE, UNDER FREMONT CULTURAL 
19:12:05 ARTS COUNCIL.

19:12:07 BUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THIS PROCLAMATION.

19:12:11 >> GOOD EVENING.

19:12:18 THIS IS JULIE GILSON.

19:12:19 THANK YOU, CONNIE.

19:12:24 THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME JUST TO ADD THAT THE VARIOUS ARTS ORGANIZATIONS 
19:12:28 THROUGHOUT FREMONT WORK DILIGENTLY TO BRING ART AND CULTURE TO OUR COMMUNITY.

19:12:34 WE IN THESE ORGANIZATIONS WOULD LIKE TO SHARE OUR VISION FOR GREATER 
19:12:40 INCORPORATE OF ART AND CULTURE INTO FREMONT'S DNA AND ITS CIVIC PLANNING.

19:12:45 AND TO THIS END, WE HAVE AND WE WILL FURTHER BE IN CONTACT WITH CITY STAFF 
19:12:50 LEADERSHIP TO ARRANGE BRIEF INTRODUCTORY MEETINGS TO DEVELOP 
19:12:54 RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR LOCAL ARTS LEADERS AND TO DISCUSS SHARED ELEMENTS 
19:12:56 OF THIS VISION.

19:13:02 THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE PROCLAMATION AND FOR RECOGNIZING THE 
19:13:03 IMPORTANCE OF ART TO THE FREMONT COMMUNITY.

19:13:08 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:13:13 WELL, I'M LOOKING AT THE TIMING BECAUSE UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVE A HARD STOP AT 
19:13:16 7:15, AS MENTIONED FOR OUR PUBLIC HEARING, AND I DON'T THINK WE'LL BE 
19:13:20 ABLE TO GET THROUGH THE OTHER TWO ITEMS AND I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THAT 
19:13:27 UNFORTUNATELY, BECAUSE OUR CITY BUSINESS -- AND HOPEFULLY THE OTHER 
19:13:32 TWO INDIVIDUALS CAN STAY UNTIL AFTER OUR PUBLIC HEARING, BECAUSE THE PUBLIC 
19:13:34 HEARING MUST BEGIN AT 7:15.

19:13:41 SO I'M GOING TO OPEN THE PUBLIC HEARING AT THIS TIME FOR OUR PUBLIC MEETING ON 
19:13:43 THE CITY OF FREMONT REDISTRICTING PROCESS.

19:13:58 AND I BELIEVE WE HAVE THE MANAGEMENT ANALYST AMANDA GALLO AND KRISTEN PARKS 
19:14:00 WHO IS THE CONSULTANT ON THIS PROJECT.

19:14:02 ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE COUNCILMEMBERS?

19:14:10 OKAY.

19:14:18 SEEING NONE, I'D LIKE TO OPEN THE PUBLIC HEARING AND MEMBERS WISHING TO 
19:14:23 SPEAK ON THE REDISTRICTING, IF THEY CAN DO SO NOW BY PRESSING THE RAISE HAND 
19:14:25 ICON OR BY DIALING STAR NINE.

19:14:38 >> MAYOR MEI, OUR CONSULTANT KRISTEN PARKS DOES HAVE A SHORT PRESENTATION 
19:14:39 TODAY TO PROVIDE THE PUBLIC.

19:14:43 >> Mayor Mei: SURE.

19:14:48 WE'LL DO THE PRESENTATION FIRST AND THEN GO TO THE PUBLIC HEARING 
19:14:49 AFTERWARDS.

19:14:50 >> OKAY.

19:14:57 AND BEFORE KRISTEN BEGINS, I JUST -- THIS IS OUR FIFTH PUBLIC HEARING AS 
19:15:02 CITY OF FREMONT, AND WE'RE APPROACHING THE DEADLINE, THE STATE DEADLINE OF 
19:15:07  APRIL 17TH, SO WANT TO STRESS THE RECOMMENDATIONS ON THE STAFF REPORT 
19:15:12 TONIGHT FOR THE COUNCIL TO ADOPT A MAP THAT WILL BE IMPLEMENTED FOR THE 
19:15:18  NOVEMBER 2022 ELECTIONS AND FOR THE NEXT 10 YEARS FOR CITY COUNCIL 
19:15:21  ELECTIONS AND DISTRICTS.

19:15:26 I WANT TO THANK THE CITY COUNCIL FOR THEIR LEADERSHIP AND DUE DILIGENCE IN 
19:15:27 THIS PROCESS.

19:15:33 WE STARTED THIS PROCESS IN JUNE OF 2021, SO IT'S BEEN A LITTLE WHILE NOW, 
19:15:39 AND WE'VE DONE EXTENSIVE OUTREACH TO THE PUBLIC AS WELL AS THE CITY COUNCIL 
19:15:44 LOOKING CLOSELY THROUGH VARIOUS VERSIONS OF THE MAP, AND ALSO WANT TO 
19:15:47 THANK OTHER CITY DEPARTMENTS, THE CITY ATTORNEY'S OFFICE FOR THEIR GUIDANCE 
19:15:52 THROUGH THIS PROCESS, AS WELL AS MOST IMPORTANTLY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WHO 
19:15:57 HAVE BEEN SHARING THEIR VOICES AND REALLY STEPPING UP FOR THEIR 
19:16:02 NEIGHBORHOODS AND ENSURING THAT OUR CITY COUNCIL MAP REPRESENTS OUR 
19:16:06 COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE.

19:16:15 SO WITH THAT, I JUST WANT TO ECHO THAT THE CITY ATTORNEY'S OFFICE ARE 
19:16:17 AVAILABLE ON THE MEETING TONIGHT FOR ANY LEGAL QUESTIONS.

19:16:20 AND WITH THAT, I'LL TURN IT OVER TO KRISTEN PARKS.

19:16:24 >> THANK YOU.

19:16:25 GOOD EVENING.

19:16:29 SO HERE WE ARE, WE HAVE ARRIVED AT THE END OF OUR REDISTRICTING JOURNEY THIS 
19:16:30 EVENING.

19:16:35 AS WE JUST HEARD, THIS IS THE PROCESS THAT BEGAN OVER THE SUMMER AND WE HAVE 
19:16:39 BEEN WORKING HARD ON THIS FOR SEVERAL MONTHS NOW.

19:16:45 BY LAW, THERE WERE FOUR REQUIRED PUBLIC HEARINGS, AND THE CITY OF FREMONT WENT 
19:16:51 ABOVE AND BEYOND, ALSO HELD A PUBLIC WORKSHOP, AND NOW IS HOLDING THE FIFTH 
19:16:58 PUBLIC HEARING, AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE LEGAL DEADLINE TO ADOPT 
19:17:00 THE NEW MAP FOR THE NEXT 10 YEARS IS APRIL 17TH.

19:17:05 THAT'S A SUNDAY, SO HERE WE ARE, AND THE FIRST ELECTION WHERE THE NEW MAP 
19:17:09 WILL BE IN PLACE WILL BE NOVEMBER 8TH OF THIS YEAR.

19:17:20 JUST A REMINDER TO MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC THAT THIS PROCESS IS GOVERNED 
19:17:24 BOTH BY FEDERAL AND BY STATE LAW, SO WE MUST COMPLY WITH THE FEDERAL 
19:17:29 REQUIREMENTS AS WELL AS THE FAIR MAPS ACT, WHICH IS CALIFORNIA'S STATE LAW.

19:17:37 THE STATE LAW GIVES US A LIST OF FACTORS AND CRITERIA THAT MUST BE 
19:17:41 CONSIDERED SO ALL OF THE MAPS WERE EVALUATED BY THESE  CRITERIA.

19:17:50 JUST A SUMMARY OF THE PROCESS THAT WE WENT THROUGH, WE  RECEIVED A TOTAL OF 
19:17:50 18 MAPS.

19:17:58 THAT IS 15 MAPS SUBMITTED BY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC AND THREE DRAWN BY NATIONAL 
19:18:03 DEMOGRAPHICS, YOUR CONSULTANTS, AND AT THE FEBRUARY 15TH HEARING, CITY 
19:18:08 COUNCIL REQUESTED REVISIONS BE MADE TO TWO PREFERRED MAPS.

19:18:15 THE PUBLIC MAP 91064, AND THE  NDC CONSULTANT GREEN MAP.

19:18:21 ON THE MARCH 1ST PUBLIC HEARING, COUNCIL IDENTIFIED THE REVISED VERSION 
19:18:27 OF PUBLIC MAP 91064 AS THE PREFERRED MAP MOVING FORWARD, AND REQUESTED AN 
19:18:29 ADDITIONAL MODIFICATION TO THAT MAP.

19:18:35 SO WHAT WE HAVE BEFORE US THIS EVENING IS REALLY THE SECOND REVISION TO 
19:18:43 PUBLIC MAP 91064, AND WHAT I WANT TO DO IS QUICKLY RUN THROUGH THE CHANGES 
19:18:48 THAT THIS MAP MAKES TO THE CURRENT DISTRICT BOUNDARIES, SO THAT FOR 
19:18:52 MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WHO HAVEN'T BEEN FOLLOWING ALONG IN THIS PROCESS, YOU 
19:18:57 CAN SEE WHAT IS ON THE TABLE FOR ADOPTION THIS EVENING.

19:19:02 SO IN ALL OF THESE IMAGES THAT I'VE SHOWN YOU, THE BLACK DASHED LINE WILL 
19:19:09 BE THE EXISTING DISTRICT BOUNDARIES, AND THE COLORED, SHADED AREAS ARE THE 
19:19:10 PROPOSED DISTRICTS FOR THE NEXT DECADE.

19:19:17 AND SO THE FIRST THING TO POINT OUT HERE IS THAT DISTRICTS 1 AND 5 REMAIN 
19:19:19 UNCHANGED.

19:19:21 THOSE BOUNDARIES ARE THE SAME.

19:19:29 WHERE WE ARE SHIFTING BOUNDARIES ARE DISTRICTS 2, 3, 4 AND 6.

19:19:36 SO FIRST ZOOMING INTO  DISTRICT 2, WHAT YOU SEE HERE IS THE PARKMONT 
19:19:41 NEIGHBORHOOD, THEN NILES NEIGHBORHOOD, AND THE CANYON HEIGHTS AREA BEING 
19:19:43 MOVED INTO DISTRICT 2.

19:19:56 SO THE NEIGHBORHOOD THAT WAS PREVIOUSLY IN DISTRICT -- PARKMONT WAS PREVIOUSLY 
19:19:59 IN DISTRICT 3 AND CANYON HEIGHTS AND NILES WERE PREVIOUSLY IN DISTRICT 4.

19:20:02 SO THOSE ARE LABELED HERE.

19:20:05 YOU CAN SEE THAT CHANGE.

19:20:12 I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT ALL OF THE CHANGES MADE HERE DO NOT MOVE VOTERS 
19:20:16 INTO A DIFFERENT VOTING YEAR.

19:20:18 SO THAT WAS SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT FOR THE CITY, WAS TO MAKE SURE WE'RE 
19:20:25 NOT PREVENTING ANY VOTERS WHO WERE EXPECTING TO VOTE IN 2022, WE WEREN'T 
19:20:27 PUSHING ANYONE TO 2024.

19:20:29 SO THIS MAP ACCOMPLISHES THAT.

19:20:36 ONE OF THE MAIN POINTS OF DISCUSSION WAS THE GLENMOOR NEIGHBORHOOD AND THE 
19:20:41 JAGGED LINE THAT YOU CAN SEE HERE THAT THE EXISTING BOUNDARIES HAVE.

19:20:49 SO WE HAVE SMOOTHED THAT OUT, WE HAVE MOVED THAT BOUNDARY LINE BETWEEN 
19:20:55 DISTRICT 2, WHICH IS SHADED BLUE, AND DISTRICT 3, THAT BOUNDARY LINE IS NOW 
19:20:58 AT THORNTON AVE AND IT EXTENDS UP TO PASEO PADRE.

19:21:05 SO WE ALSO HAVE UNIFIED AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE CENTERVILLE INTO DISTRICT 3.

19:21:12 YOU DO SEE THAT THE SUNDALE NEIGHBORHOOD HERE IS DIVIDED, AND WE 
19:21:19 DIVIDED IT IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE POPULATION BALANCE, AS MUCH AS WE 
19:21:23 DON'T WANT TO DIVIDE ANY NEIGHBORHOOD IN ORDER TO GET EACH DISTRICT TO BE 
19:21:29 RELATIVELY EQUAL IN POPULATION SIZE, THERE ARE SOME COMPROMISES THAT WE DO 
19:21:31 HAVE TO MAKE IN THESE MAPS.

19:21:40 AND FINALLY, I JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THIS SORT OF, I DON'T KNOW, SHARK FIN 
19:21:47 AREA BETWEEN DISTRICT 6 AND DISTRICT 4, AND YOU CAN FOLLOW THAT THERE ON THE 
19:21:48 RAILROAD TRACKS AS WELL.

19:21:56 IT'S JUST THAT LITTLE SMALL AREA OF THE GOMES NEIGHBORHOOD THAT IS BEING MOVED 
19:21:59 FROM CURRENT DISTRICT 6 INTO PROPOSED DISTRICT 4.

19:22:07 JUST TO UNIFY THAT NEIGHBORHOOD AND THEN, OF COURSE, THERE'S -- YOU CAN 
19:22:15 SEE THE SUNDALE NEIGHBORHOOD, THAT DIVIDING LINE BOUNDARY NOW, INSTEAD OF 
19:22:17 STEVENSON BOULEVARD MOVES TO SUNDALE DRIVE.

19:22:21 SO THIS IS JUST A HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW OF THE MAP.

19:22:26 AND YOU CAN SEE HERE THAT THIS NOVEMBER, THE DISTRICTS THAT WILL BE 
19:22:31 HOLDING ELECTIONS FOR CITY COUNCIL WILL BE DISTRICTS 2, 3, AND 4.

19:22:40 SO WITH THAT, MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WHO WANT MORE INFORMATION ON THE PROCESS 
19:22:44 ARE INVITED TO VISIT REDISTRICTFREMONT.ORG, AND IF THERE 
19:22:47 ARE ANY QUESTIONS ON THE PROPOSED MAP THIS EVENING, I AM HAPPY TO ANSWER 
19:22:47 THEM.

19:22:47 THANK YOU.

19:22:55 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION.

19:23:01 I'D LIKE TO OPEN THE PUBLIC HEARING AT THIS TIME, AND I'D LIKE TO CALL SUR.

19:23:04  RESH, PLEASE.

19:23:12 >> GOOD EVENING, CITY COUNCILMEMBERS AND STAFF.

19:23:16 I HAVE ONE QUESTION.

19:23:21 I'M A RESIDENT OF FREMONT, MY RESIDENCE IS ON THE FREMONT BOULEVARD.

19:23:30 MY CONCERN IS FACING A LOT OF TRAFFIC ON THIS ROAD AND IT IS BECOMING VERY 
19:23:35 NOISY AND A LOT OF DUST AND POLLUTION IS HAPPENING HERE.

19:23:44 SO BECAUSE OF THE NOISE, WE ARE UNABLE TO SEND KIDS OUTSIDE  HOME --

19:23:48 >> Mayor Mei: MY APOLOGIES, WE'RE SPEAKING ON THE PUBLIC REDISTRICTING 
19:23:49 RIGHT NOW, NOT PUBLIC COMMENT.

19:23:54 SO DID YOU HAVE A COMMENT PERTAINING TO THE REDISTRICTING MAP?

19:23:55 >> NO, I HAVE NO CONCERN ON THE MAP.

19:23:56 >> Mayor Mei: OKAY.

19:23:58 WE'LL CALL YOU WHEN IT COMES TO GENERAL PUBLIC COMMENTS.

19:23:59 THANK YOU.

19:24:10 MARIA SPERANZA-CAMP, ARE YOU SPEAKING ON THE REDISTRICTING THIS EVENING?

19:24:11 >> I AM.

19:24:12 HELLO, EVERYONE.

19:24:14 .

19:24:15 >> Mayor Mei: WELCOME.

19:24:16 PLEASE BEGIN.

19:24:17 >> THANK YOU FOR THAT TIME.

19:24:18 I HAD A QUESTION.

19:24:23 IT APPEARS THAT THE NORTHERN SECTION OF DISTRICT 6, SPECIFICALLY THE SECTION 
19:24:30 BETWEEN DRISCOLL, GRIMMER AND FREMONT BOULEVARD IS KIND OF AVOIDED IN THAT 
19:24:33 MISSION SAN JOSÉ DISTRICT, THE PURPLE BLEEDS OVER INTO SUNDALE.

19:24:39 WELL, THAT AREA OF THAT NORTHERN PART OF DISTRICT 6 SHARES A LOT OF 
19:24:42 COMMUNITY INTERESTS WITH I THINK IT'S DISTRICT 5.

19:24:43 IT'S NOT IN FRONT OF ME.

19:24:48 DUE TO THE PROXIMITY AND SHARING OF MULTIPLE PUBLIC FACILITIES LIKE LAKE 
19:24:58 ELIZABETH, THE NATURE PRESERVE, THE AQUA ADVENTURE WATER PART, TO ME IT 
19:25:01 SEEMS TO MAKE MORE SENSE TO GROUP THAT WITH DISTRICT 5.

19:25:09 I'M JUST CURIOUS WHY EFFORTS WERE MADE TO GO AROUND THAT SECTION.

19:25:10 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:25:19 JUST TO CLARIFY ALSO FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE WONDERING, PUBLIC COMMENTS -- IF THERE 
19:25:23 ARE ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR SPEAKERS, WE'VE HAD SEVERAL HEARINGS AND SOME OF 
19:25:26 THOSE MAY HAVE BEEN ANSWERED IN OUR PREVIOUS MEETINGS, BUT WE ALSO WILL BE 
19:25:30 HAVING -- WE HAVE SOME OF THE CONSULTANTS WHO ARE HERE WITH US AS 
19:25:36 WELL AS OUR STAFF MEMBER AMANDA GALLO WHO'S JOINED US.

19:25:36 BLAIR BEEKMAN.

19:25:38 PLEASE.

19:25:45 >> I'M SORRY, MY HAND WAS RAISED FOR THE PUBLIC COMMENT TIME.

19:25:46 SORRY.

19:25:47 THANK YOU.

19:25:48 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:25:58 ALBERTO, CAN YOU BRING BACK THE OTHER SCREEN?

19:25:59 THANK YOU.

19:26:01 THE NEXT SPEAKER WOULD BE KELLY ABREU.

19:26:04 ARE YOU SPEAKING ON THIS ITEM, SIR?

19:26:13  KELLY?

19:26:14 YOU'RE UNMUTED.

19:26:16 >> HERE WE GO.

19:26:18 YOU JUST ALLOWED ME TO UNMUTE MYSELF.

19:26:21 YES, I AM SPEAKING ON  REDISTRICTING.

19:26:27 YEAH, WE'VE HAD SEVERAL HEARINGS ON THIS REDISTRICTING, AND EVERY TIME 
19:26:33 PEOPLE WERE ASKING QUESTIONS ABOUT THE STRANGE DIVISION, THAT ZIG-ZAG LINE 
19:26:37 NEXT TO NUMBER 3, JUST TO THE RIGHT OF IT ON TO THE OLD MAP, SO WHAT WE'RE 
19:26:44 DOING NOW IS, IT'S KIND OF FUNNY, WE KEEP THE SIMILAR ZIG-ZAG BUT MOVE IT 
19:26:48 OVER TO MOWRY, AND THEN WE ZIG-ZAG AROUND FREMONT BOULEVARD, THEN ZIG-ZAG 
19:26:55 DOWN SUNDALE DRIVE AND THIS LIKE A FINGER, THE COUNTY BOARD OF 
19:26:58 SUPERVISORS DID THE SAME THING TO -- CANYON BUT I WON'T GET INTO THAT.

19:27:04 NOW WE HAVE A FINGER OF FOUR POINTING STRAIGHT DOWN ALONG SUNDALE, BETWEEN 
19:27:04 SUNDALE AND STEVENSON.

19:27:14 AND KIND OF, YOU KNOW, STRANGE THING, VERY STRANGE THING, BUT THAT'S HOW 
19:27:17 GERRYMANDERS ARE, THEY'RE ALWAYS VERY STRANGE IN THEIR SHAPE.

19:27:25 IF YOU LOOK AT THE CONCEPT OF DISTRICT 4, THE CONCEPT OF DISTRICT 4 SEEMS TO 
19:27:28 BE A CENTRAL FREMONT DOWNTOWN FREMONT  CONCEPT.

19:27:33 AND WHY WOULD YOU GO DOWN SCHWARZENEGGER ALONG SUNDALE AND 
19:27:42 STEVENSON, WHY NOT JUST GO AROUND CENTRAL PARK AND TAKE THAT FINGER AND 
19:27:47 JUST WRAP IT AROUND CENTRAL PARK AND PUT THOSE PEOPLE WITH THEIR -- YOU 
19:27:54 KNOW, THEIR SKATE PARK AND THEIR AQUA ADVENTURE PARK AND THEIR SENIOR CENTER.

19:28:00 THE PEOPLE ACROSS THE STREET FROM THE PARK, MOVE THEM INTO DISTRICT 4, AND 
19:28:07 YOU KNOW, BALANCE IT OUT BY REMOVING THEM, BY TAKING THE PEOPLE OUT OF 
19:28:10 SUNDALE AND STEVENSON, PUTTING THEM INTO DISTRICT 4 AND SO ON.

19:28:18 YOU KNOW, THE STRANGENESS OF THIS IS -- IT'S  INCOMPREHENSIBLE, BUT THERE MUST 
19:28:20 BE A GOOD POLITICAL REASON FOR DOING THIS.

19:28:25 YOU KNOW, THERE IS A STRONG POLITICAL LOGIC IN TERMS OF INCUMBENT PROTECTION.

19:28:33 USUALLY WORKING IN THESE REDISTRICTING EFFORTS THAT, WHEN YOU GET THESE 
19:28:34 STRANGE SHAPES.

19:28:39 AND IT'S USUALLY BEYOND US MERE MORTALS TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S GOING ON, BUT I'M 
19:28:41 SURE THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON.

19:28:48 ALSO UP THERE AROUND  DISTRICT 2 WITH CANYON HEIGHTS, STENHIEMER DRIVE AND 
19:28:57 PICKERING AND MORRISON CANYON ROAD, I KIND OF LIKE THAT, THE WAY --

19:28:57 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:29:00 >> THEY'RE VERY CLOSE TO NILES CANYON.

19:29:14 >> Mayor Mei: OKAY.

19:29:28 I'LL BRING IT BACK TO -- LET ME SEE IF THERE'S ANY OTHER  SPEAKERS ON -- 
19:29:31 SPEAKER FROM OUR CITY COUNCIL, VICE MAYOR SALWAN.

19:29:32 >> Vice Mayor Salwan: THANK YOU, MAYOR.

19:29:34 THANK YOU TO ALL THE FOLKS WORKING ON THIS.

19:29:41 SO IF THIS GETS APPROVED  TONIGHT, WHEN DOES IT BECOME ACTIVE?

19:29:45 IS IT RIGHT AWAY OR DO WE HAVE TO GO THROUGH A FEW MORE STEPS AFTER THIS?

19:29:52 >> Mayor Mei: STAFF, I DON'T KNOW IF SOMEONE COULD ANSWER THAT FROM THE 
19:29:53 APPROVAL PROCESS AND THE TIMING.

19:29:56 I BELIEVE IT WILL BE IMPLEMENTED IN THE NEXT ELECTIONS.

19:29:58 AMANDA?

19:30:06 OR PATRICIA, IF YOU COULD ANSWER THAT?

19:30:11 >> MY NAME IS TRICIA ORTIZ, I'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE CITY ON THE 
19:30:12 REDISTRICTING PROCESS.

19:30:18 ONCE THE CITY COUNCIL SELECTS ITS MAP, THERE IS A RESOLUTION TODAY TO ADOPT 
19:30:18 THAT MAP.

19:30:22 IT BECOMES EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY BUT IT APPLIES TO THE NOVEMBER ELECTION THIS 
19:30:22 YEAR.

19:30:29 >> Vice Mayor Salwan: I'M READY TO MAKE A MOTION AT THE RIGHT TIME.

19:30:32 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU, VICE MAYOR SALWAN.

19:30:34 COUNCILMEMBER COX, CLARIFYING QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS?

19:30:34 >> Councilmember Cox: YES.

19:30:41 I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE BLOWN UP THE STREETS THAT SHOW WHAT WAS CURRENTLY 
19:30:44 DISTRICT 6 THAT MOVED TO DISTRICT 4.

19:30:57 >> OKAY.

19:30:59 GIVE ME ONE SECOND, I WILL SHARE MY SCREEN.

19:31:00 >> Councilmember Cox: THANK YOU.

19:31:02 AND I APPRECIATE EVERYBODY'S HELP ON THIS.

19:31:07 >> WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT NOW IS THE INTERACTIVE REVIEW MAP THAT CAN BE 
19:31:10 ACCESSED ON THE REDISTRICTING WEBSITE, REDISTRICTFREMONT.ORG.

19:31:18 THE BLUE LINES YOU SEE HERE ON THE SCREEN ARE THE EXISTING DISTRICT 
19:31:22 BOUNDARIES, SO I'M ZOOMING IN HERE SO THAT YOU CAN SEE STREETS.

19:31:32 SO WHAT WE HAVE HERE IN TERMS OF WHAT IS MOVING FROM  DISTRICT 6 TO DISTRICT 
19:31:37 4, YOU CAN SEE STARTS DOWN AT WASHINGTON BOULEVARD, AND THEN FOLLOWS 
19:31:44 THE RAILROAD TRACK HERE, AND THEN ALSO IS -- YOU KNOW, INCORPORATING THIS 
19:31:53 AREA WHERE THE CURRENT BOUNDARY LINE IS THAT GOES OUT DRISCOLL ROAD UP TO 
19:31:53 PASEO PADRE.

19:31:56 ARE YOU ABLE TO SEE THAT?

19:32:02 >> Councilmember Cox: YES, I'M ALSO TRYING TO BLOW IT UP A LITTLE BIT MORE.

19:32:09 >> Mayor Mei: IT MIGHT BE  ALSO -- IT WAS PART OF OUR AGENDA ITEM.

19:32:12 I THINK THERE WAS A SEPARATE ATTACHMENT THAT DETAILED THE TRANSITIONS FROM 
19:32:13 EACH OF THE DISTRICTS.

19:32:17 

19:32:19 >> Councilmember Cox: I SEE  THAT, BUT IT'S NOT THE DETAIL OF THE STREET.

19:32:20 IT VERY VAGUE.

19:32:21 IT'S MISSING STREET NAMES.

19:32:24 >> THE INTERACTIVE REVIEW MAP IS PROBABLY THE BEST WAY TO SEE THE 
19:32:25 STREET NAMES.

19:32:29 >> Councilmember Cox: YEAH --

19:32:32 >> THE OUTLINE OF THE BUILDINGS.

19:32:34 >> Councilmember Cox: IT LOOKS BETTER ON THIS MAP THAN ON MINE.

19:32:37 DEPENDING ON THE COMPUTER.

19:32:39 AND THE RESOLUTION.

19:33:12 OKAY.

19:33:17 COULD YOU MOVE IT DOWN TO THE OTHER YELLOW?

19:33:19 >> LET'S ZOOM OUT.

19:33:22 AND WHERE WOULD YOU LIKE TO ZOOM TO?

19:33:29 >> Councilmember Cox: OKAY, BETWEEN THE YELLOW, ORANGE AND PURPLE.

19:33:31 I'M LOOKING AT THAT CORNER.

19:33:34 WHERE DOES IT GO ALONG?

19:33:41 >> YEAH, SO THERE SHOULD BE NO CHANGES TO THOSE BOUNDARY LINES FROM THE 
19:33:42 CURRENT BOUNDARY LINES.

19:33:43 >> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.

19:33:49 >> WHAT YOU DO SEE RIGHT HERE, NEAR THE FREEWAY, THAT'S  LITERALLY JUST 
19:33:49 FREEWAY.

19:33:52 SO THERE'S NO -- THERE'S NOBODY THERE.

19:33:54 >> Councilmember Cox: OH, I SEE.

19:33:57 >>  -- BOUNDARY CHANGE.

19:33:58 >> Councilmember Cox: GOT IT.

19:33:59 >> I KNOW IT KIND OF LOOKS LIKE IT.

19:34:02 >> Councilmember Cox: THAT'S WHY I WAS ASKING, BECAUSE IT KIND OF LOOKED 
19:34:06 LIKE, OKAY, WAIT A  MINUTE.

19:34:06 OKAY.

19:34:19 >> GO AHEAD.

19:34:23 >> Councilmember Cox: I WAS GOING TO ASK IF YOU COULD DO THE CORNERS OF THE 
19:34:28 -- A LITTLE BIT MORE ON THE PURPLE AND THE YELLOW, IN THAT PART THERE.

19:34:40 >> SO WE'RE FOLLOWING THE BOUNDARY HERE AT STEVENSON UP TO PASEO PADRE.

19:34:43 >> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.

19:34:45 >> TO THE RAILROAD TRACKS.

19:34:54 AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HEARD AND WAS EMPHASIZED WAS TRYING TO KEEP THE 
19:34:59 IRVINGTON NEIGHBORHOOD UNIFIED HERE, AND SO WHEN I TALKED ABOUT IT REALLY 
19:35:03 BEING, YOU KNOW, A CHALLENGE TO BALANCE THE POPULATION, THAT'S REALLY WHAT'S 
19:35:12 GOING ON HERE, AND JUST TO LET MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC KNOW, THERE ARE NO 
19:35:14 COUNCILMEMBERS OR INCUMBENTS LIVING IN THIS AREA.

19:35:21 SO THESE LINES ARE NOT IN ANY WAY RELATED TO WHERE COUNCILMEMBERS LIVE.

19:35:24 THIS REALLY IS JUST ABOUT BALANCING POPULATION.

19:35:27 >> Councilmember Cox: GOT IT.

19:35:31 BECAUSE IT LOOKED LIKE IT WAS ONLY A LITTLE OVER 1200, WAS THE CHANGE WHEN 
19:35:39 YOU DID THE -- THAT CORNER SPOT WHICH IS LIKE LESS THAN 1% CHANGE.

19:35:44 >> YEAH, SO THIS AREA OF GOMES WAS A VERY SMALL CHANGE, YES.

19:35:51 SO TO DISTRICT 6 -- NO CHANGES TO DISTRICTS 1 AND 5 AND THEN A VERY 
19:35:53 SMALL CHANGE TO DISTRICT 6.

19:35:54 >> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.

19:35:55 UNDERSTOOD.

19:35:56 THANK YOU SO MUCH.

19:36:05 I APPRECIATE ALL OF YOU HELPING TO GET US TO THE POINT OF FINALIZING THE 
19:36:10 REDISTRICTING AND THANK YOU SO MUCH, AND BLOWING IT UP HELPS A LITTLE BIT 
19:36:15 MORE ON YOUR SCREEN THAN MINE, DEPENDING ON HOW OLD YOUR COMPUTER IS.

19:36:16 THANK YOU.

19:36:17 THANK YOU SO MUCH.

19:36:25 >> MAYOR AND COUNCIL, I JUST WANT TO LET YOU KNOW THE PUBLIC HEARING 
19:36:28 PORTION HAS BEEN CLOSED AND YOU ARE NOW IN THE PHASE OF CITY COUNCIL 
19:36:29 DISCUSSION AND DELIBERATION OF THE ITEM.

19:36:35 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU FOR THAT CLARIFICATION, ROCIO, AND THAT IS 
19:36:37 TRUE, FOR CLOSING THE PUBLIC COMMENT AND WE ARE ALSO CURRENTLY IN THE 
19:36:39 COUNCIL AND I'VE HEARD FROM TWO OF THE COUNCILMEMBERS.

19:36:41 ARE THERE ANY OTHER ONES?

19:36:43 I KNOW THERE WAS A MOTION BY VICE MAYOR SALWAN.

19:36:47 SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER JONES.

19:36:53 SEEING NO OTHER COMMENTS, I'D LIKE TO ASK FOR A ROLL CALL VOTE ON THIS, 
19:36:54 PLEASE.

19:37:26 AND WE'RE GOING TO RETURN TO OUR PREVIOUSLY SCHEDULED AGENDA  ITEMS.

19:37:36 WHICH WILL RESUME WITH A PROCLAMATION --

19:37:38 >> City Mgr. Shackelford: MAYOR MEI, MAY I JUMP IN FOR JUST A MOMENT?

19:37:40 >> Mayor Mei: CERTAINLY.

19:37:43 >> City Mgr. Shackelford: I THINK WE NEED TO RETURN TO THE CONSENT ITEM 
19:37:46 THAT WAS PULLED BEFORE WE CONTINUE WITH THE PROCLAMATIONS.

19:37:47 >> Mayor Mei: SURE.

19:37:49 >> City Mgr. Shackelford: JUST AS A POINT OF ORDER.

19:37:50 >> Mayor Mei: SURE.

19:37:53 >> City Mgr. Shackelford: AND I BELIEVE THAT WAS ITEM 2B.

19:37:55 >> Mayor Mei: AS IN BASEBALL.

19:38:00 COUNCILMEMBER COX, YOU WANTED TO COMMENT ON THAT ITEM?

19:38:01 >> Councilmember Cox: YES.

19:38:10 THERE ARE SOME MISSING NAMES AND THERE ARE SOME MISSPELLINGS ON THIS MEETING 
19:38:12 MINUTES FOR DATING BACK TO MARCH 15TH.

19:38:20 AND I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE IT CORRECTED, AND THEN RESUBMITTED FOR APPROVAL.

19:38:31 >> MS. MAYOR, THAT WAS AN APPROPRIATE POINT OF CORRECTION.

19:38:35 WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IS CORRECTIONS WILL BE MADE AND THITE TEM WILL COME BACK 
19:38:35 TO THE COUNCIL FOR APPROVAL.

19:38:37 THEY CANNOT BE APPROVED AT THIS MEETING.

19:38:39 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU SO MUCH.

19:51:02 PEAK TIMES, THAT UNFORTUNATELY, IF YOU ARE IN A LARGE ACCIDENT OR SOMETHING 
19:51:06 AND NEED TRAUMA SERVICES, IT SOMETIMES CAN TAKE ALMOST AN HOUR TO EITHER 
19:51:12 TRAVEL NORTH OR SOUTH, AND THAT BOTH WAYS, TO GET THE SERVICES THAT YOU 
19:51:14 NEED IN TERMS OF THAT LEVEL OF TRAUMA CARE.

19:51:19 AND MANY DOCTORS AND NURSES TALK ABOUT THAT GOLDEN HOUR THAT IS REALLY 
19:51:24 IMPORTANT IN TERMS OF HAVING GOOD OUTCOMES, IS TO RECEIVE TRAUMA CARE 
19:51:26 BEFORE THAT, WITHIN THAT HOUR.

19:51:31 SO GIVEN THAT WE ARE THE LOCAL COMMUNITY HOSPITAL, WE HAVE BEEN 
19:51:35 TALKING TO OUR RESIDENTS AND TALKING TO THE COUNTY ABOUT THE NEED FOR 
19:51:39 WASHINGTON TO BECOME A TRAUMA CENTER, AND WE'RE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THE 
19:51:41 COUNTY LOOKING AT IT AT THIS POINT.

19:51:45 WE FEEL WE'RE READY TO BE A TRAUMA CENTER, WE HAVE THE POPULATION THAT 
19:51:51 SUPPORTS IT, WE HAVE OVER 350,000 RESIDENTS IN ALAMEDA COUNTY.

19:51:56 IT'S SUPPOSED TO GROW IN THE NEXT 10 TO 15 YEARS ALMOST TO 400,000.

19:52:02 WE HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE AS YOU KNOW, WE OPENED THE CRITICAL CARE PAVILION 
19:52:02 IN 2018.

19:52:09 WE HAVE A 39-BED E.R. WITH TWO TRAUMA BAYS THAT ARE ALL READY IN TERMS OF 
19:52:10 TRAUMA SERVICES.

19:52:18 WE HAVE A 48-BED ICU, AND WE HAVE 65 MED-SURG BEDS JUST IN THAT CRITICAL 
19:52:18 CARE PAVILION.

19:52:23 SO REALLY ALL UNDER ONE ROOF, WE COULD TAKE CARE OF ALL THE TRAUMA NEEDS THAT 
19:52:24 ANY PATIENT WOULD REQUIRE.

19:52:32 WE'RE REALLY EXCITED TO HOPEFULLY BE A PART OF THE TRAUMA NETWORK, AND WE 
19:52:38 TRULY BELIEVE THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO SAVE LIVES HERE BY PROVIDING THIS 
19:52:39 SERVICE HERE IN THIS COMMUNITY.

19:52:44 SO REALLY ON BEHALF OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS, OUR STAFF, OUR PHYSICIANS 
19:52:49 AND MOST OF ALL, OUR PATIENTS IN THIS COMMUNITY, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR 
19:52:49 RECOGNIZING WASHINGTON.

19:52:50 THANK YOU.

19:52:54 AND SUPPORTING US.

19:52:56 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU, ABSOLUTELY.

19:53:07 I'VE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE PART OF WORKING CLOSELY WITH YOU, KIMBERLY, 
19:53:11 AND YOUR TEAM OVER THE YEARS, AND WE'VE TRULY VALUED THE PARTNERSHIP, 
19:53:14 ESPECIALLY IN THIS MOMENT, WHEN IT'S BEEN VERY CHALLENGING WITH THE 
19:53:21 PANDEMIC AND SEEING THE ADDITION OF THE CRITICAL CARE CENTER.

19:53:25 I KNOW THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN LONG IN EFFORT AND TIME WAITING FOR US 
19:53:28 TO BE ABLE TO GET THIS, SO WE WERE ABSOLUTELY SUPPORTIVE OF THIS, AS 
19:53:31 THERE IS TRUE DEMAND WITHIN OUR COMMUNITIES.

19:53:35 SO I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THIS, AND BEING ABLE TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN.

19:53:43 A LITTLE BIT BIASED SINCE I HAVE A FEW MADE IN WASHINGTON HOSPITAL PRODUCTS 
19:53:47 AT HOME, SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT OVER THE YEARS.

19:53:48 >> THANK YOU.

19:53:49 >> Mayor Mei: COUNCILMEMBER COX?

19:53:52 >> Councilmember Cox: I JUST WANTED TO ECHO ALL OF THE SUPPORT FROM KIMBERLY, 
19:53:59 HER ENTIRE HOSPITAL STAFF, AND  EVERYONE HAS JUST BEEN WONDERFUL AND 
19:54:02 WE REALLY APPRECIATE, WHEN IT CAME TO SERVICE, ESPECIALLY DURING THE 
19:54:07 PANDEMIC, AND I APPRECIATE YOUR HELP AND HAVING MY FIRST TOWN HALL LAST 
19:54:14 YEAR ON COVID, THAT A LOT OF ANSWERS WERE STILL BEING ASKED AND YOU WERE 
19:54:18 RIGHT THERE TO ANSWER THEM, YOU AND THE CHIEF MEDICAL DIRECTOR.

19:54:23 I JUST CAN'T THANK YOU ENOUGH FOR ALL THE WORK THAT YOU'RE CONTINUING TO DO, 
19:54:30 AND WE DO NEED MORE HOSPITAL CARE AND MORE LOCAL IN THE COMMUNITY TO HELP 
19:54:35 SERVE US AND PROVIDE THE HELP FROM OUR -- TO OUR COMMUNITY FOR OUR RESIDENTS.

19:54:42 ALSO I REALLY APPRECIATE OVER THE YEARS, BEING PART OF OHLONE COLLEGE, 
19:54:45 ALLOWING OUR NURSING STAFF STUDENTS TO BE ABLE TO TRAIN AND THAT WOULD BE 
19:54:51 ANOTHER ADDITIONAL ADDITION TO COMPLEMENT THE LEARNING THERE AT 
19:54:51 OHLONE.

19:54:56 WE HAVE A DEDICATED WING THAT HAS WASHINGTON HOSPITAL BECAUSE OF THE 
19:55:01 YEARS OF COLLABORATION, DONATING ALL THE WONDERFUL EQUIPMENT THAT THE 
19:55:09 STUDENTS ARE ABLE AND CONTINUE TO LEARN, AS THEY EMBRACE THE HEALTHCARE 
19:55:12 FIELD, AND I CAN'T THANK THE PARTNERSHIP AND ALL THE WONDERFUL 
19:55:17 SERVICE AND WORK TOGETHER AND LOOK FORWARD TO MORE CONTINUING.

19:55:20 JUST LET US KNOW WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO HELP PUSH.

19:55:23 AS YOU KNOW IN MY OTHER PROFESSION WORKING IN THE HOSPITAL AND THE JOINT 
19:55:29 COMMISSION, THESE ARE VERY SERIOUS THINGS THAT -- HEALTH AND SAFETY, 
19:55:33 FOREMOST TOP PRIORITY AND WE WANT THAT TO CONTINUE AND HELP SUPPORT THE WORK 
19:55:37 AND THE EFFORT OF WASHINGTON HOSPITAL TO GROW.

19:55:40 SO THANK YOU, AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BRINGING THIS FORTH.

19:55:40 >> THANK YOU.

19:55:47 AND I TRULY BELIEVE THAT COLLABORATIONS BETWEEN LOCAL ORGANIZATIONS ARE 
19:55:51 IMPORTANT TO THE TWO AND IMPROVING THE HEALTH OF THIS COMMUNITY.

19:55:53 >> Mayor Mei: COUNCILMEMBER  KENG.

19:55:55 >> Councilmember Keng: YES, THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR.

19:56:02 SO I JUST WANTED TO SHARE BRIEFLY OUR -- MY SUPPORT FOR WASHINGTON HOSPITAL 
19:56:03 BECOMING A TRAUMA CENTER.

19:56:09 OUR FAMILY HAD SUFFERED SOME MAJOR ILLNESSES THE LAST COUPLE YEARS, AND I 
19:56:17 JUST THANK WASHINGTON HOSPITAL SUPPORT AS WELL AS ALL THE HEALTHCARE WORKERS 
19:56:20 THROUGH THE PANDEMIC THE LAST COUPLE YEARS, AND NOW WE DEFINITELY NEED ALL 
19:56:25 THE RESOURCES THAT WE CAN GET FOR OUR COMMUNITY HERE, SO THANK YOU AGAIN AND 
19:56:26 YOU GUYS HAVE OUR SUPPORT.

19:56:26 THANK YOU.

19:56:30 >> THANK YOU AGAIN FOR  EVERYONE'S SUPPORT.

19:56:35 IT TRULY MEANS A GREAT DEAL TO OUR STAFF, OUR PHYSICIANS, BUT REALLY OUR 
19:56:35 PATIENTS.

19:56:35 SO THANK YOU.

19:56:38 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:56:42 I THINK I SPEAK ON BEHALF OF ALL OF OUR COUNCIL, WE'RE VERY PLEASED AND 
19:56:45 HONORED TO HAVE SUCH A FINE INSTITUTION AND THAT WE HAVE HEALTHCARE AVAILABLE 
19:56:48 TO OUR COMMUNITY AND HOPE TO CONTINUE TO EXPAND THAT.

19:56:53 NEXT I NEED TO GO BACK, I THINK THERE WAS A NOTE THAT WHEN WE DID THE 
19:56:57 CONSENT CALENDAR, WE MADE A MOTION AND I NEED TO MAKE A MOTION TO WAIVE THE 
19:56:59 SECOND READING INFORMATION FOR TWO  ITEMS.

19:57:03 >> YES, THAT IS CORRECT,  MS. MAYOR.

19:57:08 THINK WE WERE TRYING TO GET TO THE 7:15 PUBLIC HEARING ON TIME BUT UNDER THE 
19:57:12 BROWN ACT, WE ARE SUPPOSED TO -- OR THE COUNCIL IS SUPPOSED TO DO A MOTION TO 
19:57:16 WAIVE THE COMPLETE READING OF THE ORDINANCES AND I'LL BE HAPPY THEN TO 
19:57:21 READ THE TITLE SO YOU CAN DO A MOTION ON THOSE TWO, YOU CAN REVISIT THEM AND 
19:57:22 WE CAN TAKE CARE OF THEM.

19:57:24 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU, ROCIO.

19:57:25 COULD YOU PLEASE DO SO?

19:57:33 >> THERE ARE TWO MOTIONS ON THE CONSENT CALENDAR TO PASS BY MOTION.

19:57:41 SECOND READING AND ADOPTION OF AN ORDINANCE AMENDING SECTIONS 205130 AND 
19:57:46 210110 FREMONT MUNICIPAL CODE REGARDING THE REDRAWING OF LEK TRIN DISTRICT 
19:57:52 BOUNDARIES AND MAKING CONFORMING CHANGES DUE TO HAVING A  SEVEN-MEMBER 
19:57:53 COUNCIL.

19:57:58 ORDINANCE D, SECOND READING AND ADOPTION OF AN ORDINANCE  REZONING A 
19:58:09 22.4-ACRE SITE AT 40517, 40525 EL BRAY STREET AND 6,000 STEVENSON BOULEVARD 
19:58:19 FROM  P200610 PLANNED DISTRICT TO A  P2021-150 PRELIMINARY AND PRECISE 
19:58:24 PLANNED DISTRICT TO ALLOW A THREE-BUILDING APPROXIMATELY 397,000 
19:58:26 SQUARE FOOT INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT.

19:58:34 SO IF THE COUNCIL CAN DO A QUICK MOTION ON THOSE TWO --

19:58:36 >> Councilmember Cox: SO MOVE.

19:58:38 >> Mayor Mei: MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER COX.

19:58:40 >> Councilmember Shao: SECOND.

19:58:42 >> Mayor Mei: SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER SHAO.

19:58:44 ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE.

19:58:47 >> Mr. Quintanilla:COUNCILMEMBE R COX, AYE.

19:58:49 COUNCILMEMBER SHAO, AYE.

19:58:51 COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, AYE.

19:58:54 COUNCILMEMBER JONES, AYE.

19:58:57 COUNCILMEMBER KENG, AYE.

19:59:00 VICE MAYOR SALWAN, AYE.

19:59:03 MAYOR MEI, AYE.

19:59:06 SO THAT PASSES UNANIMOUSLY.

19:59:12 AND JUST TO CLARIFY FOR THOSE WHO ARE WONDERING FOR THE RESOLUTION FOR 
19:59:15 TRAUMA CENTER, IT SOMETHING OUR COUNCIL IS PASSING JUST IN SUPPORT OF THE 
19:59:18 PROJECT BUT IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO TAKE A SEPARATE VOTE ON.

19:59:26 NEXT IS OUR PUBLIC COMMUNICATIONS, AND THESE ARE FOR ORAL COMMUNICATIONS FOR 
19:59:31  ITEMS THAT ARE NOT ON THIS EVENING'S AGENDA.

19:59:34 IF WE COULD HAVE TWO MINUTES PER SPEAKER ON THAT.

19:59:42 AND I SEE THE FIRST SPEAKER IS BLAIR BEEKMAN.

19:59:47 >> HI, BLAIR BEEKMAN.

19:59:49 THANKS FOR THE MEETING TONIGHT.

19:59:53 HAPPY APRIL, EVERYONE.

19:59:55 IT'S JUST NICE TO BE PART OF THE MEETING TONIGHT.

20:00:02 WITH THE WASHINGTON TRAUMA HOSPITAL CENTER, I DIDN'T KNOW WHETHER THAT WAS 
20:00:02 FINALIZED OR NOT.

20:00:09 GOOD LUCK IN HOW TO -- WHATEVER THE -- OF THE TRAUMA CENTER, THAT YOU'RE 
20:00:12 WORKING TOWARDS THOSE GOOD PRACTICES.

20:00:13 GOOD LUCK IN THOSE EFFORTS.

20:00:21 TWO OTHER ITEMS I WANTED TO BRING UP, SINCE YOU HAVE A CONSENT CALENDAR ITEM 
20:00:27 ON TELECONFERENCING IN THIS ERA OF COVID.

20:00:32 I THINK THIS SORT OF ITEM SHOULD ALLOW FOR A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF -- A WAY A 
20:00:37 PERSON CAN TALK ABOUT COMMUNITY PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY ISSUES AROUND COVID 
20:00:42 AS KIND OF A CLARIFICATION AND HELP FOR THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE PROCESS THAT 
20:00:48 WE CAN ALL HAVE  BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF OUR LIFE WITH COVID AND WHAT TO 
20:00:50 PREPARE FOR.

20:00:55 WE HAVE A -- GOING ON WITH CHINA RIGHT NOW, IT'S PRETTY SERIOUS.

20:01:02 AND LOCAL CITY WASTE MANAGEMENT WATER SYSTEM, COVID IS ON THE RISE.

20:01:06 THEY'RE COLLECTING HIGHER COVID SAMPLES.

20:01:11 SO WE HAVE TO BE STILL PREPARING FOR COVID STILL, FOR THE NEXT FEW WEEKS 
20:01:11 AND MONTHS.

20:01:18 AND MASK USE IS STILL IMPORTANT, DISTANCING IS STILL IMPORTANT.

20:01:20 BE WARY, BE CAREFUL.

20:01:27 AND TO CONCLUDE, THIS PAST WEEKEND, YOU KNOW, A LOT OF TALK ABOUT HOW LONG THE 
20:01:30 WAR IN UKRAINE IS GOING TO BE EXTENDING TOWARDS.

20:01:38 I THINK THINK THE WORK WE DO WITH REIMAGINE, RACIAL EQUITY, 
20:01:44 ACCOUNTABILITY, REALLY -- A COMMUNITY PROCESS THAT WILL BE NEEDED FOR ALL 
20:01:49 SIDES FOR PEACE FOR THE FUTURE OF THE UKRAINE AREA, HOW WE CAN ALL 
20:01:50 PARTICIPATE IN THAT, EVERYONE.

20:01:50 THANK YOU.

20:01:58 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

20:02:06 THE NEXT SPEAKER FOR PUBLIC COMMUNICATIONS IS -- I THINK IT WAS MARIE.

20:02:09 WELCOME, MARIE.

20:02:13 >> MY NAME IS MARIE HUGHES, AND I'M A LONG TIME RESIDENT OF FREMONT AND A 
20:02:15 MEMBER OF THE LEADERSHIP TEAM OF FREMONT FOR EVERYONE.

20:02:20 I AM SPEAKING IN SUPPORT OF THE CITY'S SAFE PARKING PROGRAM.

20:02:23 THE OTHER DAYS WAY READING AN ARTICLE ABOUT COLLEGES THAT ARE OPENING UP 
20:02:26 THEIR PARKING LOTS FOR THEIR STUDENTS WHO LIVE IN CARS.

20:02:30 SOME OF THE COMMENTS OF THESE STUDENTS STUCK WITH ME.

20:02:34 IN PARTICULAR, THOSE FROM A STUDENT NAMED CHRISTINE, A BUSINESS 
20:02:38 ADMINISTRATION STUDENT WHO SLEPT IN HER CAR FOR PARTS OF 2019 AND 2020.

20:02:44 SHE SAID THAT BEFORE SHE EXPERIENCED HERSELF, SHE HAD THOUGHT LIVING IN A 
20:02:46 CAR WOULD BE LIKE CAMPING.

20:02:50 WHAT SHE HADN'T ANTICIPATED WAS THE AMOUNT OF WORK AND ANXIETY THAT CAME 
20:02:53 WITH TRYING TO FIND A PLACE TO PARK EVERY NIGHT.

20:02:57 HOW TO LOCATE A PARKING SPOT THAT WAS SAFE BUT NOT IN A NEIGHBORHOOD WHERE 
20:02:58 SOMEONE WHO CALL THE COPS.

20:03:03 HOW DIFFICULT IT WAS TO FIND ANYWHERE TO PARK IF SHE HAD TO WORK UNTIL 10:00 
20:03:13 P.M., AS SHE OFTEN DID, WHERE TO USE THE BATHROOM, WHERE TO BRUSH HER 
20:03:17 TEETH, WORRYING IF SHE DIDN'T BRUSH THEM.

20:03:21  -- WHY DON'T YOU TRY TO FIND THESE PEOPLE HOMES?

20:03:22 BUT IT'S NOT THAT EASY, SHE  SAID.

20:03:27 IT WAS HELPFUL FOR STUDENTS LIKE HER TO JUST HAVE THAT STEPPING STONE.

20:03:28 YOU'RE SAFE FOR NOW.

20:03:37 FREMONT'S SAFE PROGRAM IS ALSO A STEPPING STONE AND A PLACE OF SAFETY.

20:03:40 THEREFORE I ENCOURAGE THE COUNCIL TO CONTINUE WITH THE CURRENT PROGRAM, THE 
20:03:44 ONE THAT PARTNERS WITH NON-PROFITS AND THEIR PARKING LOTS BY ALSO 
20:03:49 ACCELERATING THE CREATION OF THE CITY SPONSORED PROGRAM PART OF THE CITY'S 
20:03:51 COMPREHENSIVE PLAN TO COMBAT HOMELESSNESS.

20:03:52 THANK YOU.

20:03:55 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU, MARIE.

20:04:01 AND THE NEXT SPEAKER I HAVE ON THERE IS KELLY ABREU.

20:04:02 WELCOME, KELLY.

20:04:04 >> YEAH.

20:04:13 ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WAS STATED JUST NOW ABOUT THESE PUBLIC COMMENTS FOR 
20:04:21 ITEMS NOT ON THE AGENDA, WELL, THAT SEEMS RATHER DIFFICULT BECAUSE THIS 
20:04:27 COUNCIL DOES THINGS IN THE FORMS OF PROCLAMATIONS AND  RESOLUTIONS, BRINGS 
20:04:32 IN THE  CHOIR, EVERYBODY SINGS FROM THE CHOIR BOOK AND PROVIDES SUPPORT AND 
20:04:40 ACCLAMATIONS FOR WHATEVER ISSUES YOU WANT TO SUPPORT WITHOUT PUBLIC 
20:04:40 COMMENTS.

20:04:47 I WOULD POINT YOU TO THE TRAUMA CENTER WHICH YOU DIDN'T ALLOW ANY PUBLIC 
20:04:48 COMMENTS FOR.

20:04:53 I WON'T TALK ABOUT THAT PARTICULAR ISSUE.

20:05:02 ON THE PROCLAMATION FOR OHLONE COLLEGE, I'D LIKE TO COMMENT ON THAT 
20:05:07 PROCLAMATION WITH -- EVEN THOUGH YOU DIDN'T ALLOW COMMENTS ON THAT 
20:05:13 PROCLAMATION, OHLONE COLLEGE HAD A TRANSITION IN LEADERSHIP RECENTLY, AND 
20:05:23 THIS WAS A FANTASTICALLY IMPORTANT AND SIGNIFICANT TRANSITION, YOU SHOWED 
20:05:30 LEADERSHIP AND THE NEW LEADERSHIP IS DYNAMIC, IT'S REALLY MAKING SOME GOOD 
20:05:35 IMPROVEMENTS IN THE FACILITIES AND IN THE ATMOSPHERE OF THE WAY THAT COLLEGE 
20:05:44 OPERATES THIS THING IS REALLY MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION, AND IT'S 
20:05:46  REINVIGORATED THE ENTIRE ADMINISTRATION THERE.

20:05:53 , THEY HAVE A DYNAMIC SPIRIT AND I THINK PEOPLE SHOULD RECOGNIZE THAT 
20:05:59 THIS THING IS REALLY STARTING TO GATHER PACE AND IS MOVING IN THE RIGHT 
20:05:59 DIRECTION.

20:06:00 THANK YOU.

20:06:06 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

20:06:09 NEXT SPEAKER IS JOHN HINDS.

20:06:12 WELCOME, JOHN.

20:06:13 >> HELLO, EVERYONE.

20:06:17 FIRST, THANK YOU FOR PURSUING THE CASE INVOLVING THE FORMER CITY MANAGER, 
20:06:20 THOUGH IT'S NOT A HAPPY THING TO HAVE TO DO.

20:06:24 SECOND, THERE IS A HISTORY OF ALLEGATIONS AROUND THIS PERSON WHICH 
20:06:29 AT THIS POINT ARE NOT PROVED BUT COULD STILL INFORM US IN THINKING THROUGH 
20:06:30 POLICIES TO PREVENT SUCH PROBLEMS.

20:06:36 THIS HISTORY INCLUDES IN OTHER CITIES, HIRING FRIENDS INTO SWEET NEW JOBS 
20:06:41 THAT NO ONE HAD PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT NEEDED AND THEN BEING HIRED BY A 
20:06:46 FRIEND INTO A NEWLY CREATED JOB WHICH NO ONE HAD PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT NEEDED.

20:06:51 THAT LATER CASE WAS SO CLOSE TO A PENSION DEADLINE THAT SOME PEOPLE 
20:06:53 SUSPECTED THE JOB WAS CREATED FOR THAT REASON ALONE.

20:06:57 AND THEN WE GET THESE MOST RECENT CHARGES INVOLVING THE PERSONAL USE OF 
20:06:58 CITY FUNDS.

20:07:08 THESE ARE JUST ALLEGATIONS NOW, BUT IF A RATIONAL PERSON TRULY DID THESE 
20:07:11 THINGS THEN THEY MUST HAVE THOUGHT THEY WERE GOING TO GET AWAY WITH T THEY 
20:07:15 MUST HAVE THOUGHT THESE WERE NORMAL ACCEPTABLE EVERYBODY DOES IT PRACTICES 
20:07:16 IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT.

20:07:17 THAT THOUGHT IS ALARMING.

20:07:23 IT EVEN MORE ALARMING WHEN YOU CONSIDER THAT IN HIS TWO STINTS IN FREMONT, HE 
20:07:27 WAS LIKELY INVOLVED IN HIRING OTHER STAFF MEMBERS, AND WE HAVE TO WONDER 
20:07:32 NOW JUST HOW WIDESPREAD THESE ATTITUDES HAVE BECOME HERE.

20:07:38 ONE STEP WORTH TAKING RIGHT AWAY IS TO PUT EVERYONE THROUGH A REFRESHER 
20:07:43 COURSE ON BASIC WORKPLACE ETHICS, AND BY BASIC ETHICS, I MEAN NOT THE NEW 
20:07:50  HOTNESS BUZZ PHRASES DU JOUR, I MEAN THE MOST BASIC STUFF LIKE THE 
20:07:54 DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MY MONEY AND THE CITY'S, THE BASIC IDEA THAT AN 
20:07:57 EMPLOYEE IS AN AGENT WHO IS PAID TO LOOK OUT FOR THE INTERESTS OF THE 
20:08:00 PEOPLE, PAYING HIM AND NOT JUST TO TAKE CARE OF HIMSELF OR HIS FRIENDS.

20:08:07 WE NEED TO RE-ESTABLISH THOSE BASICS BECAUSE AT THE MOMENT, MANY OF US ARE 
20:08:09 WONDERING JUST WHAT HAS BEEN GOING ON HERE.

20:08:11 THANK YOU.

20:08:13 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

20:08:19 NEXT -- COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, I SEE YOU RAISED YOUR HAND.

20:08:23 DID YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO COMMENT ON THAT SPECIFIC ITEM?

20:08:28 >> Councilmember Kassan: I JUST WANTED TO ADD SOMETHING AT THE END OF PUBLIC 
20:08:29 COMMENT IF POSSIBLE.

20:08:29 >> Mayor Mei: SURE.

20:08:29 THANK YOU.

20:08:30 MARIA?

20:08:32 YOU'RE THE NEXT PUBLIC SPEAKER.

20:08:32 THANK YOU.

20:08:38 >> HELLO, GOOD EVENING, COUNCILMEMBERS AND MAYOR.

20:08:45 I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK ABOUT IDEAS ABOUT MAKING AUTOMALL AND 
20:08:50 GRIMMER SAFER, MORE ACCESSIBLE FOR PEDESTRIANS AND BUS USERS.

20:08:55 I ONLY GOT TWO MINUTES HERE SO I TO WANT TO NOTE THAT I  ACCOMPANIED THE 
20:08:58 MAIN POINTS I'M GOING TO BRING UP IN A PRESENTATION SLIDE DECK WHICH I SHARED 
20:09:01 WITH THE CITY CLERK AND I HOPE THAT THAT HAS BEEN SHARED TO EACH 
20:09:06 COUNCILMEMBER AND THE MAYOR SO YOU CAN LOOK AT THE MORE DEEPER EXPLANATIONS 
20:09:09 FOR THE MAIN POINTS I'M GOING TO BRING UP TODAY.

20:09:15 BUT GETTING RIGHT TO IT, WHAT I'D LIKE TO SUGGEST IS THAT WE OPEN UP LINE 
20:09:21 239, THE BUS LINE 239 THAT RUNS ALONG GRIMMER BOULEVARD EVERY DAY, NOT JUST 
20:09:23 MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY.

20:09:29 ADDITIONALLY WHAT I ALSO SUGGEST IS THAT WE RE-LOOK THE BUS STOPS LOCATE 
20:09:32 ED ON AUTOMALL PARKWAY.

20:09:32 SO WHY?

20:09:39 MY SON GOES TO MILLARD, MY DAUGHTER GOES TO KENNEDY, WE ARE ALL BUS USERS.

20:09:42 AND BECAUSE WE CAN'T GET TO A BART STATION EVEN THOUGH WARM SPRINGS BART 
20:09:47 IS LOCATED CLOSER TO US, WE HAVE TO WALK ON THAT CRAZY THOROUGHFARE AND 
20:09:50 STRETCH OF AUTOMALL PARKWAY TO GET TO A BUS STOP.

20:09:55 AND I FEEL LIKE A VERY VULNERABLE PEDESTRIAN THERE WITH THE HIGH SPEED 
20:09:56 TRAFFIC.

20:10:00 IN THE SLIDE DECK, YOU CAN SEE A PHOTOGRAPH OF A CRASH THAT HAPPENED AT 
20:10:01 A BUS STOP.

20:10:08 SO MY ALTERNATIVES RIGHT NOW IS TO GO TO A BUS STOP WHICH THE SAN JOSÉ 
20:10:13 MERCURY PUBLISHED AN ARTICLE TITLED THE SORRIEST BUS STOP REMAINS UNCHANGED 
20:10:15 FOR FOUR YEARS, THAT'S MY BUS STOP.

20:10:19 SO IT TAKES ME 15 MINUTES TO WALK ON AUTOMALL PARKWAY TO GET THERE.

20:10:23 I LIVE IN THE APARTMENT COMPLEX ON THE CORNER OF AUTOMALL AND GRIMMER.

20:10:27 OR MY ALTERNATIVE IS TO WALK ACROSS THE HIGHWAY FOR 15 MINUTES, GO ACROSS THE 
20:10:31 STREET TOWARDS TARGET IN PACIFIC COMMONS TO GET TO THE BUS STOP OVER 
20:10:31 THERE.

20:10:36 SO WE REALLY NEED TO LOOK AT HOW WE ARE POSITIONING THE BUS STOPS ON AUTOMALL 
20:10:36 PARKWAY.

20:10:42 I SUGGEST THAT WE HAVE A BUS STOP IN FRONT OF UNITECH COLLEGE AND AT THE 
20:10:43 GAS STATION.

20:10:44 I ONLY HAVE TWO MINUTES.

20:10:46 PLEASE TAKE A LOOK AT --

20:10:46 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

20:10:50 I JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY QUICKLY FOR THE SPEAKER THAT THE BUSES ARE 
20:10:56 ACTUALLY THE DETERMINATIONS OF STOPS AND LOCATIONS ARE ACTUALLY SET BY A 
20:11:01 SEPARATE AGENCY, WHICH IS AC TRANSIT, AND THAT THEY OFTEN HAVE PUBLIC  
20:11:04 HEARINGS AND THAT WOULD PROBABLY BE THE BEST WAY TO SHARE SOME OF THAT 
20:11:08 FEEDBACK, BUT THANK YOU FOR YOUR INFORMATION AND I'LL BE HAPPY TO ALSO 
20:11:09 FORWARD THAT ON.

20:11:19 NEXT PUBLIC SPEAKER, ONE MORE, SURESH, WELCOME.

20:11:21 >> GOOD EVENING, EVERYONE.

20:11:29 YEAH, THE CONCERN WHICHS WAY MENTIONING PREVIOUSLY, WE ARE LIVING ON FREMONT 
20:11:32 BOULEVARD, MY RESIDENCE IS LOCATED ON FREMONT BOULEVARD AND THE TRAFFIC ON 
20:11:41 THE FREMONT BOULEVARD IS QUITE HIGH, AND THE NOISE AND SOUND VIBRATIONS AND 
20:11:47 DUST POLLUTION  IS -- OUR HOME BECAUSE OUR HOMES ARE FACING FREMONT 
20:11:47 BOULEVARD.

20:11:55 IS THERE A POSSIBILITY TO BUILD A NICE BARRIER WALL ALONG FREMONT BOULEVARD 
20:12:04 THAT WILL HELP US A LOT, BECAUSE MY FAMILY, MY KIDS, EVEN THE NEIGHBORS, 
20:12:08 THEIR FAMILY AND KIDS, THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO COME OUT OF THE HOME BECAUSE OF 
20:12:11 HIGH SPEED TRAFFIC THAT IS GOING ON ON FREMONT BOULEVARD.

20:12:17 IF YOU COULD TAKE INITIATIVE TO BUILD A SOUND BARRIER WALL ON THE FREMONT 
20:12:22 BOULEVARD FROM THE GRIMMER INTERSECTION TOWARDS STEVENSON BOULEVARD, THAT WILL 
20:12:29 BE REALLY -- FOR ALL OF THE FAMILIES ON THE ROAD, ALL THE ONES THAT ARE FACING 
20:12:30 THE FREMONT BOULEVARD.

20:12:36 FROM THE NEIGHBORS, WHEN I SPOKE WITH THEM, MOST OF THE RESIDENTS ARE 
20:12:39 WILLING TO SHARE THE COST OF BUILDING THE SOUND BARRIER WALL.

20:12:49 IF THE CITY CAN TAKE INITIATIVE TO START -- ARE WILLING TO SHARE THE COST 
20:12:50 OF BUILDING THE WALL.

20:12:50 THANK YOU.

20:13:00 >> Mayor Mei: NEXT, WE'LL GO BACK TO OUR REGULARLY SCHEDULED AGENDA ITEMS.

20:13:08 >> Councilmember Kassan: I JUST WANTED TO MAKE A --

20:13:11 >> Mayor Mei: I'M SORRY, YES, COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN.

20:13:14 >> Councilmember Kassan: AIM NOT SURE IF THIS IS THE APPROPRIATE TIME BUT I 
20:13:18 JUST DID WANT TO MENTION THERE WAS A COMMUNITY MEETING AT CHRIST THE KING 
20:13:23 LUTHERAN CHURCH ABOUT THE SAFE PARKING PROGRAM, AND IT WAS  VERY, VERY 
20:13:29 INFORMATIVE AND THERE WAS SOMEONE THERE FROM THE PROGRAM THAT'S BEEN RUNNING 
20:13:34 IN CUPERTINO FOR QUITE A LONG TIME, AND IT WAS JUST INCREDIBLY INFORMATIVE TO 
20:13:34 HEAR THEIR EXPERIENCE.

20:13:39 THEY'VE BEEN DOING IT NOW FOR FOUR YEARS, AND I JUST WOULD REALLY LOVE IF 
20:13:45 PEOPLE WOULD SEE IF YOU CAN GET A RECORDING, IF YOU ARE INTEREST 
20:13:49 INTERESTED IN THE SAFE PARKING PROGRAM TO GET A RECORDING OF THAT MEETING AND 
20:13:53 ALSO POSSIBLY REACH OUT TO THE PEOPLE AT THE CUPERTINO SAFE PARKING PROGRAM 
20:13:57 TO LEARN MORE ABOUT HOW THE SAFE PARKING PROGRAM HAS BEEN GOING IN 
20:13:57 OTHER CITIES.

20:13:58 THANK YOU.

20:14:02 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU, COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN.

20:14:09 NEXT WE'RE GOING TO RETURN TO THE ITEMS THAT WERE ON THE AGENDA THIS EVENING, 
20:14:11 AND THAT'S ITEM 5B AS IN BOY.

20:14:16 AND THAT'S THE PUBLIC ART FOR WARM SPRINGS PLAZA.

20:14:20  SITE IN WARM SPRINGS INNOVATION DISTRICT.

20:16:40 NEXT ON OUR AGENDA THIS EVENING IS ITEM 7A, WHICH IS THE  2023-2031 HOUSING 
20:16:41 ELEMENT UPDATE PRESENTATION.

20:16:46 AND WE HAVE PRINCIPAL PLANNER WAYLAND LI WHO WILL BE SHARING THE 
20:16:47 PRESENTATION.

20:16:50 WELCOME, WAYLAND.

20:16:58 >> GOOD EVEN.

20:17:02 MY NAME IS WAYLAND LI, PRINCIPAL PLANNER.

20:17:13 THE ITEM BEFORE YOU IS A PRESENTATION OF THE CITY'S UPCOMING 2023 TO 2031 
20:17:16 HOUSING ELEMENT, WHICH IS PLAN TO MEET THE HOUSING NEEDS OF EVERYONE IN THE 
20:17:18 COMMUNITY OVER THE NEXT EIGHT YEARS.

20:17:24 TO LEAD OFF I'D LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT THAT THERE'S A LOT OF DATA IN THE FOLLOWING 
20:17:28 SLIDES, BUT OUR INTENTION IS TO BE CONCISE AND HIGH LEVEL.

20:17:34 ACCORDINGLY, WE'LL BE POSTING THE SLIDES ONLINE AT  FREMONT.GOV/HOUSING 
20:17:37 ELEMENT TO ALLOW FOR MORE DETAIL FOLLOWING TONIGHT'S MEETING.

20:17:43 THE PURPOSE OF TONIGHT'S PRESENTATION IS TO REVIEW THE SPECIFIC COMPONENTS 
20:17:47 OF THE HOUSING ELEMENT, AND HOW THEY FIT TOGETHER TO FORM AN EFFECTIVE 
20:17:48 HOUSING STRATEGY.

20:17:52 WITH A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS OF THE HOUSING 
20:17:56  ELEMENT, THE COUNCIL AND THE COMMUNITY ARE GOING TO BE BETTER POSITIONED TO 
20:18:01 PROVIDE MEANINGFUL FEEDBACK AND INSIGHTS WHICH WILL ULTIMATELY LEAD TO 
20:18:03 A MORE EFFECTIVE PLAN.

20:18:09 THIS SLIDE PROVIDES AN OVERVIEW OF OUR PRESENTATION THIS  EVENING.

20:18:14 WE'LL BRIEFLY RECAP WHAT IS A HOUSING ELEMENT, WHICH WE PRESENTED ON A 
20:18:18 COUPLE MONTHS  AGO, WE'LL DISCUSS THE KEY COMPONENTS OF THE HOUSING ELEMENT, 
20:18:23 AND WE'LL ALSO TALK ABOUT WHAT WE'VE HEARD SO FAR FROM THE CITY'S BOARDS 
20:18:24 AND COMMISSIONS THAT WE'VE VISITED.

20:18:31 FIRST OFF IS A QUICK RECAP OF WHAT IS A HOUSING ELEMENT.

20:18:37 UNDER STATE LAW, CITIES IN CALIFORNIA ARE REQUIRED TO PLAN FOR THE HOUSING 
20:18:41 NEEDS OF THEIR COMMUNITIES, BY UPDATING THEIR HOUSING ELEMENTS OF THEIR 
20:18:44 GENERAL PLAN EVERY EIGHT YEARS.

20:18:49 THE HOUSING ELEMENT PROMOTES THE PROVISION OF SAFE, ADEQUATE, AND 
20:18:52 AFFORDABLE HOUSING TO EVERYONE IN THE COMMUNITY, INCLUDING THOSE AT ALL 
20:18:55 INCOME LEVELS AND THOSE WITH SPECIAL HOUSING  NEEDS.

20:19:00 LIKE ALL BAY AREA CITIES, FREMONT IS IN THE PROCESS OF UPDATING ITS HOUSING 
20:19:06 ELEMENT TO COVER THE UPCOMING 2023 TO 2031 PLANNING PERIOD.

20:19:17 ESSENTIALLY A HOUSING ELEMENT CAN BE SUMMARIZED IN SIX KEY COMPONENTS.

20:19:21 THE FIRST ROW IN THE SLIDE, NUMBERS 1 THROUGH 3, ARE WHAT WE'RE CALLING THE 
20:19:22 FOUNDATIONAL PIECES OF THE HOUSING ELEMENT.

20:19:26 WE PROVIDE A FACTUAL BASIS TO DETERMINE WHAT THE HOUSING NEEDS OF THE 
20:19:32 COMMUNITY ARE, AND SERVE AS BUILDING BLOCKS FOR FORMATION OF APPROPRIATE 
20:19:35 AND EFFECTIVE POLICIES AND PROGRAMS TO RESPOND TO THOSE NEEDS.

20:19:40 THE BOTTOM ROW ARE THE  ACTIONABLE ITEMS.

20:19:45 THEY BUILD OFF OF THE FOUNDATIONAL ANALYSIS AND ESTABLISH ACTIONABLE 
20:19:47 ITEMS TO MEET THE COMMUNITY'S HOUSING NEEDS.

20:19:52 IN THE NEXT FEW SLIDES, WE'LL TALK A BIT MORE ABOUT THESE INDIVIDUAL 
20:19:52 COMPONENTS.

20:20:02 THE FIRST COMPONENT IS REVIEW OF THE PREVIOUS/CURRENT HOUSING ELEMENT WHICH 
20:20:04 COVERS THE YEARS 2015 TO 2023.

20:20:11 DEVELOPING A HOUSING ELEMENT ALWAYS BEGINS WITH REVIEW OF ACTIONS AND 
20:20:17 APPROACHES TO HOUSING BY THE CITY'S CURRENT -- WHILE LOOKING CRITICALLY AT 
20:20:22 CURRENT PRACTICE, WE CAN ENSURE THAT PAST ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND LESSONS 
20:20:24 LEARNED ARE REFLECTED IN FUTURE POLICY.

20:20:30 AS YOU KNOW EVERY YEAR WE COME TO THE COUNCIL WITH AN ANNUAL PROGRESS REPORT 
20:20:30 ON HOUSING.

20:20:34 STAFF HAS ANALYZED ALL THE ANNUAL REPORTS SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE 
20:20:35 CYCLE IN 2015.

20:20:41 IN THE NEXT FEW SLIDES, WE TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE KEY POINTS FROM THAT 
20:20:42 ANALYSIS.

20:20:49 THE KEY METRIC FOR EVALUATING HOW WE DID IN THE PREVIOUS HOUSING ELEMENT IS 
20:20:52 HOUSING PRODUCED RELATIVE TO HOUSING NEEDS.

20:20:58 OUR HOUSING NEEDS FOR THE CURRENT HOUSING ELEMENT CYCLE WAS DETERMINED 
20:21:15 TO BE 5,455 TOTAL UNITS KNOWN AS OUR -- IT'S THE NUMBER OF NEW HOUSING UNITS 
20:21:19 AT VARIOUS INCOME LEVELS THAT ARE NEEDED TO ACCOMMODATE OUR  GROWING 
20:21:19 POPULATION.

20:21:29 THE RHNA IS BROKEN DOWN BY DIFFERENT HOUSING INCOME LEVELS.

20:21:33 OVER HALF OF OUR ALLOCATION IS FOR LOWER INCOME AFFORDABLE HOUSING.

20:21:35 THAT'S WHERE THE NEED IS THE GREATEST.

20:21:40 ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE SLIDE, YOU CAN SEE THAT WHILE OVERALL PRODUCTION WAS 
20:21:44 STRONG AND EXCEEDED THE CITY'S RHNA TARGET, THE PRODUCTION OF THE LOWER 
20:21:47 INCOME CATEGORIES FELL SHORT OF TARGETS.

20:21:54 AS WE MOVE INTO THE NEXT HOUSING ELEMENT CYCLE, THE VERY DIFFICULT 
20:21:59 QUESTION OF HOW WE MEET THE HOUSING NEEDS AT THOSE LOWER INCOME LEVELS IS 
20:22:04 AMPLIFIED AS THE RHNA TARGETS FOR THIS NEXT CYCLE ARE CONSIDERABLY HIGHER.

20:22:09 WE'VE HEARD FROM THE PLANNING COMMISSION SPECIFICALLY THAT WE SHOULD 
20:22:16 BE CREATIVE AND  RESOURCEFUL AND THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX FOR WAYS TO MEET OUR 
20:22:17 AFFORDABLE HOUSING NEEDS MOVING FORWARD.

20:22:22 BUT AS A BASELINE TO BUILD OFF OF, OUR PROGRESS REPORT INDICATES THAT THE 
20:22:27 CITY HAS MANY EFFECTIVE POLICIES AND PROGRAMS CURRENTLY IN PLACE THAT HAVE 
20:22:30 BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN DELIVERING AFFORDABLE HOUSING, INCLUDING AN 
20:22:35 UPDATED AFFORDABLE HOUSING ORDINANCE AND A COMMERCIAL LINKAGE FEE.

20:22:39 POLICIES AND PROGRAMS THAT THE CITY HAS IN PLACE NOW HAS RESULTED IN THE 
20:22:43 PRODUCTION OF MORE THAN TWICE AS MANY AFFORD ABLG UNIT IN THIS CYCLE THAN 
20:22:43 THE LAST CYCLE.

20:22:52 ANOTHER AREA OF PARTICULAR SUCCESS DURING THE CURRENT HOUSING ELEMENT 
20:22:56 RELATES TO THE PRODUCTION OF ACCESSORY  DEVELOPMENT UNITS OR ADUs.

20:23:05 ALTHOUGH NOT DEED RESTRICTED AFFORDABLE HOUSING, IT HAS  HELPED TO DELIVER 
20:23:08 HOUSING THAT'S AFFORDABLE BY DESIGN, AT THE SAME TIME SERVING THE NEEDS OF 
20:23:12 YOUNG PEOPLE, SENIORS AND INTERGENERATIONAL FAMILIES.

20:23:18 VARIOUS PROGRAMS INCLUDING WAIVING OF DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEES AND A 
20:23:30 PREAPPROVED -- PROGRAM HAVE FED INTO THE SUCCESS OF THE ADU PROGRAMMENT 
20:23:33 ALSO, BY TARGETING RESOURCES STRATEGICALLY, THE CITY HAS BEEN 
20:23:35 SUCCESSFUL IN DEVELOPING HOUSING SOLUTIONS THAT PROVIDE HOUSING TO 
20:23:37 PEOPLE WITH SPECIAL NEEDS.

20:23:42 THIS INCLUDES TWO SENIOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS THAT RESULTED IN 
20:23:46 APPROXIMATELY 180 NEW UNITS OF AFFORDABLE SENIOR HOUSING.

20:23:50 THE CITY HAS ALSO DEDICATED RESOURCES TOWARDS MEETING THE NEEDS OF THE 
20:23:53 UNHOUSED, INCLUDING THE CREATION OF THE HOUSING NAVIGATION CENTER.

20:23:58 THESE ARE AMONG A NUMBER OF IMPACTFUL HOUSING PROGRAMS CURRENTLY IN PLACE 
20:24:00 THAT HAVE LED TO SUCCESSES.

20:24:06 THIS UPCOMING HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATE EFFORT WILL BE AN OPPORTUNITY TO 
20:24:12 EXPLORE WHAT ELSE WE CAN DO AND WHAT WE CAN DO  BETTER TO MEET THE COMMUNITY'S 
20:24:13 HOUSING NEEDS.

20:24:26 THE SECOND FOUNDATIONAL IS HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT, DATA THAT TELLS US 
20:24:27 WHO WE NEED TO BE PLANNING FOR.

20:24:31 OVER THE NEXT FEW SLIDES, I'LL TALK ABOUT WHAT INFORMATION WE'VE COLLECTED 
20:24:33 SO FAR TELLS US ABOUT OUR COMMUNITY'S HOUSING NEEDS.

20:24:44 FREMONT ALONG WITH THE REST OF THE BAY AREA IS GROWING.

20:24:49 REGIONAL PROJECTIONS INDICATE THAT THE BAY AREA WILL BE HOME TO ANOTHER 2 
20:24:51 MILLION PEOPLE BY THE YEAR 2050.

20:24:57 THIS IS DRIVEN BY A STRONG JOB MARKET WHICH IS FUELED AND WILL CONTINUE TO 
20:25:00 FUEL THE DEMAND FOR HOUSING.

20:25:07 AS JOB AND POPULATION GROWTH  OUTPACED HOUSING PRODUCTION, THE COST OF 
20:25:10 HOUSING HAS RISEN IN BOTH FOR SALE AND RENTAL HOUSING MARKETS OVER THE YEARS.

20:25:25 AS HOUSING BECOMES MORE UNAFFORDABLE, THE PREVALENCE OF COST BURDEN -- AND 
20:25:27 OVERCROWDING HOUSING RESULTING IN INCREASES.

20:25:33 THIS IS MOST EVIDENT AT THE LOWER INCOME LEVELS WHERE APPROXIMATELY 68% 
20:25:38 OF EXTREMELY LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS ARE COST BURDENED COMPARED TO JUST 10% OF 
20:25:42 HOUSEHOLDS ABOVE AREA MEDIAN INCOME.

20:25:45 WHILE LOWER INCOME HOUSEHOLDS IN GENERAL ARE LIKELY TO EXPERIENCE 
20:25:49 OVERCROWDING, MODERATE INCOME HOUSEHOLDS IN PARTICULAR ARE THE MOST 
20:25:50 LIKELY TO EXPERIENCE OVERCROWDING.

20:25:54 INDICATING A LACK OF HOUSING THAT MEETS THE NEEDS OF THAT INCOME LEVEL.

20:25:59 THESE CONDITIONS ARE ALSO MUCH MORE PRONOUNCED IN THE COMMUNITY WITH 
20:26:04 RENTERS, WHO ARE FAR MORE LIKELY THAN HOMEOWNERS TO LIVE IN OVERCROWDED 
20:26:05 CONDITIONS AND TO BE COST BURDENED.

20:26:20 DATA SHOWS THE COMMUNITY IS OLDER, NECESSITATING MORE SERVICES AND 
20:26:22 HOUSING TARGETED SPECIFICALLY FOR SENIORS.

20:26:27 ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SPECTRUM, BECAUSE OF UNAFFORDABLE HOUSING 
20:26:31 PRICES, YOUNGER HOUSEHOLDS ARE FINDING IT CHALLENGING TO PURCHASE A HOME.

20:26:40 HOUSEHOLDERS AGED 25 TO 44 INDICATE A HIGH LEVEL OF DIFFICULTY ENTERING THE 
20:26:41 HOUSING MARKET.

20:26:46 DATA ALSO SHOWS THAT FREMONT IS A COMMUNITY OF COLOR, WITH MORE THAN 
20:26:49 THREE QUARTERS OF THE COMMUNITY IDENTIFYING AS ASIAN, HISPANIC OR 
20:26:50 AFRICAN AMERICAN.

20:26:56 COURTNEY WILL DISCUSS LATER IF THE PRESENTATION, BUT DATA SHOWS THAT 
20:27:01 COMMUNITIES OF COLOR DISPROPORTIONATELY FACE HOUSING CHALLENGES LIKE 
20:27:01 HOMELESSNESS OR OVERCROWDING.

20:27:09 PEOPLE WITH SPECIAL HOUSING NEEDS INCLUDING THOSE WITH DISABILITIES, 
20:27:14 EXTREMELY LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS ARE A BIG PART OF THE COMMUNITY IN TERMS OF 
20:27:14 NUMBERS.

20:27:17 AS WE HEARD FROM THE HUMAN RELATIONS AND THE SENIOR COMMISSIONS, HOUSING 
20:27:23 STRATEGIES NEED TO BE PURPOSEFUL, MEETING THE NEEDS OF THESE SPECIAL 
20:27:23 POPULATIONS.

20:27:30 IT'S NOTABLE THAT FREMONT IS A COMMUNITY THAT REALLY SUPPORTS AND 
20:27:34 ENHANCES THE LIVES OF THOSE WITH SPECIAL NEEDS AND THOSE WITH LOWER 
20:27:35 INCOMES.

20:27:42 THE STATE HAS PREPARED A RESOURCE MAP THAT IDENTIFIES AREAS IN THE STATE 
20:27:46 WITH HIGH RESOURCES, MEANING THAT LOW INCOME RESIDENTS IN THESE AREAS HAVE 
20:27:52 ACCESS TO JOBS AND QUALITY EDUCATION, A HEALTHY ENVIRONMENT, AND OTHER FACTORS 
20:27:55 WHICH PROMOTE POSITIVE CRITICAL LIFE OUTCOMES.

20:28:02 AS YOU WOULD EXPECT, ALMOST ALL OF FREMONT IS IN A HIGH OR VERY HIGH 
20:28:02 RESOURCE AREA.

20:28:08 MEANING THAT WE HAVE THOSE RESOURCES IN PLACE THAT ALLOW DISADVANTAGED 
20:28:13 RESIDENTS WITH THE BEST OPPORTUNITIES FOR SOCIOECONOMIC MOBILITY AND FUTURE 
20:28:14 POSITIVE LIFE OUTCOMES.

20:28:22 THE CITY'S HOUSING STOCK NEEDS TO BE RESPONSIVE TO ALL THESE VARIOUS 
20:28:23 HOUSING NEEDS.

20:28:35 AS YOU MAY KNOW, A MAJORITY OF THE STOCK ARE IN THE FORM OF SINGLE-FAMILY 
20:28:36 TRACT HOMES.

20:28:41 MOVING FORWARD WOULD ENCOURAGE A SHIFT IN THE HOUSING STOCK TO MULTIFAMILY 
20:28:42 UNITS AROUND  TRANSIT.

20:28:47 THE CITY THINKS ABOUT HOW TO MEET ITS EXISTING SINGLE-FAMILY NEIGHBORHOODS 
20:28:49 AS WELL AS WITHIN THE MULTIFAMILY DEVELOPMENT.

20:28:58 MOVING ON TO THIRD FOUNDATIONAL COMPONENT, THE HOUSING ELEMENT MUST 
20:29:03 INCLUDE CON STRAINTS ANALYSIS THAT IDENTIFIES THE BARRIERS TO MEETING 
20:29:04  HOUSING NEEDS.

20:29:10 BY IDENTIFYING CONSTRAINTS TO HOUSING, WE CAN DEVELOP TARGETED POLICY 
20:29:12 RESPONSES TO ADDRESS THOSE SPECIFIC BARRIERS.

20:29:18 GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS CONSIST GENERALLY OF THINGS WHERE THE CITY HAS 
20:29:21 SOME LEVEL OF DIRECT CONTROL.

20:29:24 ONE OF THE CONSTRAINTS THAT THE PLANNING COMMISSION WAS PARTICULARLY 
20:29:26 INTERESTED IN  HAVING STAFF LOOK AT WAS PARKING REQUIREMENTS.

20:29:29 PARTICULAR A LINEAR TRANSIT.

20:29:35 AND WHAT THAT POSES TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING.

20:29:46 IN TERMS OF NON-GOVERNMENTAL CONSTRAINTS, THE HIGH COST OF LAND IN 
20:29:51 THE AREA IS CLEARLY A HUGE BARRIER TO HOUSING, BUT ALSO LACK OF COMMUNITY 
20:29:54 SUPPORT FOR HOUSING, PARTICULARLY AFFORDABLE HOUSING CAN BE A MAJOR 
20:29:56 CONSTRAINT AS WELL.

20:30:00 WE'VE HEARD FROM THE PLANNING COMMISSION THE MESSAGE THAT MARKETING 
20:30:04 THE NEED BENEFITS AFFORDABLE HOUSING NEED TO BE A CENTRAL PART OF THE 
20:30:04 HOUSING ELEMENT.

20:30:11 I'LL NOW TURN THE PRESENTATION OVER TO COURTNEY PAL WHO WILL BRIEFLY TALK 
20:30:16 .

20:30:20 >> THANK YOU, I'LL BE REVIEWING THREET ACTIONABLE COMPONENTS OF OUR HOUSING 
20:30:24 ELEMENT AND SINCE WE'RE STILL AT THE INITIAL  STAGES OF COMPLETING ANALYSIS 
20:30:29 OF OUR COMMUNITY'S HOUSING NEEDS, THESE SECTIONS WILL BE A BIT MORE BRIEF, AS 
20:30:33 WE'RE LOOKING FOR YOUR INPUT IN THESE TYPES OF ACTIONABLE POLICY CHOICES.

20:30:39 I'LL START MY PORTION OF THE PRESENTATION BY DISCUSSING THE SITES 
20:30:40 INVENTORY COMPONENT OF OUR HOUSING ELEMENT.

20:30:46 THIS IS THE COMPONENT THAT WILL PROVIDE A LIST OF SITES THAT CAN ACCOMMODATE 
20:30:49 OUR REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS ALLOCATION AT ALL DIFFERENT INCOME LEVELS.

20:30:56 DESPITE THE SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN OUR ALLOCATION, FREMONT IS IN A GOOD 
20:30:59 POSITION TO ACCOMMODATE OUR RHNA ALLOCATION WITHOUT REZONING INDIVIDUAL 
20:30:59 SITES.

20:31:13 THE CITY'S 2011 GENERAL PLAN PLANNED FOR A STRATEGIC -- THE MAP SHOWN ON 
20:31:16 THE SLIDE INDICATES OUR PRIORITY DEVELOPMENT AREAS OR PDAs WHICH ARE 
20:31:20 THE AREAS NEAR MAJOR TRANSIT CORRIDORS THAT HAVE SIGNIFICANT EXISTING 
20:31:22 CAPACITY FOR HOUSING GROWTH.

20:31:27 STAFF BELIEVES THAT THE EXISTING GENERAL PLAN AND ZONING LARGELY IN 
20:31:31 THESE AREAS PROVIDE SUFFICIENT CAPACITY TO ACCOMMODATE OUR RHNA.

20:31:36 IMPORTANTLY, MOST OF THE SITES CONTAINED WITHIN OUR HOUSING INVENTORY 
20:31:43 WILL BE LOCATED ADJACENT TO TRANSIT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CITY RATHER THAN 
20:31:48 GREEN FILED DEVELOPS LOCATED ON THE EDGES OR PERIPHERY OF TOWN.

20:31:52 THIS WILL HELP US MEET OUR CLIMATE AND SUSTAINABILITY GOALS.

20:31:59 THE NEXT COMPONENT IS OUR GOALS, POLICIES AND PROGRAMS, WHICH SET THE 
20:32:03 POLICY DIRECTION FOR THE CITY'S HOUSING PRODUCTION.

20:32:11 THE CITY'S 2015 THROUGH 2023 HOUSING ELEMENT HAS EIGHT GOALS, 22 POLICIES, 
20:32:12 AND 69 PROGRAMS.

20:32:17 THE POLICIES AND PROGRAMS IMPLEMENT THE INTENTIONS BEHIND EACH GOAL.

20:32:21 NOW BECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY POLICIES AND PROGRAMS, I WON'T BE GOING THROUGH 
20:32:26 ALL OF THEM TONIGHT, BUT A VERY HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW IS PRESENTED ON THIS 
20:32:26 SLIDE.

20:32:33 GOAL NUMBER ONE PERTAINS TO PRESERVING EXISTING HOUSING WITHIN OUR COMMUNITY, 
20:32:40 AND CONTAINS PROGRAMS SUCH AS PROVIDING ANNUAL TRAINING TO LANDLORDS ON 
20:32:43 HABITABILITY REQUIREMENTS, MONITORING AT RISK AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS AND 
20:32:48 CONTINUING TO ENFORCE THE CITY'S MOBILE HOME RENT STABILIZATION ORDINANCE.

20:32:55 GOALS 2, 3, 5 AND 7 CALL FOR FACILITATION OF NEW, HIGH QUALITY 
20:33:00 HOUSING WITH A PARTICULAR EMPHASIS ON  DEVELOPING AFFORDABLE HOUSING.

20:33:06 PROGRAMS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS GOAL INCLUDE DEVELOPMENT OF ACCESSORY 
20:33:10 DWELLING UNITS, PROVIDING FUNDING FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS, AND 
20:33:14 ADVOCATING FOR THE EXPANSION OF STATE FINANCIAL RESOURCES FOR AFFORDABLE 
20:33:15 HOUSING.

20:33:25 FINALLY, GOALS 4 AND 6 ARE TO PROTECT OUR MOST VULNERABLE RESIDENTS FROM 
20:33:27 DISCRIMINATION AND DISPLACEMENT.

20:33:35 RELATED PROGRAMS ENCOURAGE -- FOR DISABLED, UNHOUSED, LOW INCOME OR 
20:33:36 ELDERLY.

20:33:39 BECAUSE THE CITY IS WELL PREPARED TO MEET ITS RHNA WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT 
20:33:50 REZONING, STAFF FEELS THAT THE GOALS, POLICIES AND PROGRAMS WILL RELY BE THE 
20:33:51 FOCUS OF THE UPDATE.

20:33:55 WE'VE HEARD THAT WE SHOULD THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX AND FIND INNOVATIVE 
20:33:59 WAYS TO PROMOTE AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT IN OUR COMMUNITY, AND THE 
20:34:05 GOALS, POLICIES AND PROGRAM SECTION IS OUR OPPORTUNITY TO SET A POLICY AGENDA 
20:34:05 TO DO JUST THAT.

20:34:13 THE FINAL COMPONENT OF OUR HOUSING ELEMENT IS AFFIRMATIVELY FURTHERING 
20:34:16 FAIR HOUSING, AND THIS IS A NEW REQUIREMENT IN THE HOUSING ELEMENT 
20:34:20 PLANNING CYCLE THAT REQUIRES US TO TAKE  MEANINGFUL ACTIONS TO OVERCOME 
20:34:24 PATTERNS OF SEGREGATION ON BOTH A REGIONAL LEVEL AND ON A LOCAL LEVEL.

20:34:32 SO WITHIN A REGIONAL CONTEXT, FREMONT CAN BE CATEGORIZED AS A RACIALLY 
20:34:34 DIVERSE AREA OF HIGH OPPORTUNITY.

20:34:38 WAYLAND SHOWED A VERSION OF THE MAP ON THE LEFT ZOOMED IN TO FREMONT, BUT 
20:34:42 THIS VERSION THAT I HAVE ON THIS SLIDE SHOWS A PICTURE ZOOMED OUT.

20:34:44 THE ENTIRE BAY AREA IS SHOWN.

20:34:48 AND YOU CAN SEE THAT FREMONT IS ONE OF A FEW COMMUNITIES IN THE EAST BAY THAT 
20:34:53 QUALIFIES AS A HIGHEST RESOURCE OR HIGH RESOURCE AREA, WHICH ARE THE AREAS IN 
20:34:54 REALLY DEEP BLUE.

20:34:58 IMPORTANTLY, NO PARTS OF OUR CITY QUALIFY AS A LOW RESOURCE, WHICH IS IN 
20:35:07 THE LIGHT GREEN, OR A HIGH SEGREGATION AND  POVERTY -- THIS REFLECTS THE 
20:35:11 OVERALL QUALITY OF SCHOOLS AND ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY IN OUR CITY COMPARED TO 
20:35:11 THE REGION AS A WHOLE.

20:35:19 YOU'LL ALSOS IN THAT WHILE THE HIGHEST RESOURCE AREAS ON THE PENINSULA AND IN 
20:35:26 THE TRI-VALLEY AREA TEND TO HAVE A  PREDOMINANTLY WHITE POPULATION WHICH 
20:35:35 IS SHOWN IN BEIGE IN THE MAP ON THE RIGHT, FREMONT'S HIGH RESOURCE AREAS 
20:35:36 ARE SHOWN IN  PINK.

20:35:41 ONE OF THE KEY PATTERNS RELATES TO THE DRCTS OF LOW AND MODERATE INCOME 
20:35:43 HOUSEHOLDS WHICH IS WHAT IS SHOWN ON THIS MAP.

20:35:47 LOW AND MODERATE INCOME HOUSEHOLDS ARE GENERALLY MORE PREVALENT WITHIN THE 
20:35:51 CENTRAL AND NORTHERN AREAS OF THE CITY, AND THE AREAS WEST OF MISSION 
20:35:52 BOULEVARD.

20:35:56 THESE ARE AREAS THAT ARE LOCATED CLOSE TO THE BART STATION DOWNTOWN, THE 
20:36:00 PROPOSED BART STATION IN IRVINGTON AND THE ACE STATION IN CENTERVILLE.

20:36:05 AND THIS IS A PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT PATTERN TO THE HOUSING ELEMENT BECAUSE 
20:36:09 IF YOU RECALL JUST A FEW SLIDES AGO DISCUSSING OUR SITES INVENTORY, THIS 
20:36:13 IS THE AREAS WHERE MOST OF FREMONT'S PLANNED AFFORDABLE HOUSING GROWTH 
20:36:15 WITHIN THE NEXT CYCLE IS PLANNED.

20:36:20 AND SO IN ORDER TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE AFFIRMATIVELY 
20:36:24 FURTHERING FAIR HOUSING SECTION, OUR HOUSING ELEMENT IS ALSO GOING TO NEED 
20:36:29 TO TAKE SPECIFIC POLICY ACTIONS TO ENCOURAGE AFFORDABLE HOUSING 
20:36:34 DEVELOPMENT WITHIN THE WEALTHIEST AREAS OF THE CITY WHERE THERE ARE NOT AS 
20:36:40  CURRENTLY PREVALENT LOW/MODERATE INCOME POPULATIONS.

20:36:43 THAT CONCLUDES OUR REVIEW OF THE HOUSING ELEMENT COMPONENTS.

20:36:50 OUR DRAFT HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATE IS GOING TO NEED TO CONTAIN ALL OF THE 
20:36:55 COMPONENTS THAT ARE SHOWN ON THIS SLIDE IN ORDER TO BE STATUTORILY COMPLIANT, 
20:36:58 AND SO WE'D BE INTERESTED TONIGHT IN HEARING COUNCIL'S QUESTIONS AND 
20:37:04 FEEDBACK ON ANY OF THE DIFFERENT REQUIRED ANALYSES AND THE  ACTIONABLE 
20:37:08  ITEMS THAT WE'LL NEED TO COMMIT TO.

20:37:12 IN ORDER TO GET FEEDBACK ON THESE COMPONENTS WE'LL BE VISITING, VARIOUS 
20:37:17 BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS THIS SPRING, AND EACH OF THE BOARDS, WE'VE GIVEN AN 
20:37:20 INTRODUCTION TO THE HOUSING ELEMENT AND HOW IT RELATES TO THEIR INDIVIDUAL 
20:37:21 MISSION OR AREA OF EXPERTISE.

20:37:26 YOU'VE HEARD SOME OF THAT INPUT REFLECTED IN OUR PRESENTATION TONIGHT, 
20:37:29 AND WE'LL CONTINUE TO INCORPORATE THEIR FEEDBACK AS WE MOVE FORWARD WITH OUR 
20:37:30 HOUSING ELEMENT DRAFT.

20:37:36 WE'RE ALSO PROVIDING OPPORTUNITIES FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO PROVIDE 
20:37:39 FEEDBACK AND INPUT ON HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATE.

20:37:44 WE'RE ENCOURAGING PEOPLE INTERESTED IN THIS PROCESS TO GO TO OUR WEBSITE, 
20:37:50 WHICH IS SHOWN ON THE SCREEN, WHERE THEY CAN SIGN UP TO BE NOTIFIED OF 
20:37:52 DIFFERENT MEETINGS, LISTENING SESSIONS AND OTHER EVENTS.

20:38:00 WE'RE ALSO OFFERING MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC OFFICE HOURS, SO PEOPLE CAN 
20:38:04 SIGN UP TO HAVE A ONE ON ONE CASUAL CONVERSATION WITH US TO DISCUSS THEIR 
20:38:07 INTERESTS, THOUGHTS AND PRIORITIES RELATED TO HOUSING IN FREMONT.

20:38:17 WE EXPECT TO HAVE A COMPLETE DRAFT OF THE HOUSING ELEMENT TO SHARE WITH YOU 
20:38:20 AND THE PUBLIC IN JUNE 2022.

20:38:23 AT THAT POINT WE'LL BE RETURNING FOR ADDITIONAL REVIEW AND INPUT.

20:38:26 SO THAT CONCLUDES OUR PRESENTATION THIS EVENING.

20:38:30 IN ADDITION TO MYSELF AND WAYLAND,  WHO ARE NOW AVAILABLE FOR ANY QUESTIONS OR 
20:38:37 COMMENTS, WE ALSO HAVE OUR HOUSING  MANAGER, LUCIA HUGHES TO ANSWER ANY 
20:38:42 QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE AS WELL AS OUR PLANNING MANAGER JOEL PULLEN.

20:38:45 THANK YOU AND I'LL HAND IT BACK TO YOU, MAYOR MEI.

20:38:46 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

20:38:54 SO AT THIS TIME, I WANTED TO SEE IF THERE ARE ANY CLARIFYING QUESTIONS 
20:38:54 FROM THE COUNCIL.

20:39:04 SEEING NONE, I'M GOING TO ASK FOR THE PUBLIC COMMENT, AND I THINK WE HAVE A 
20:39:05 COUPLE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC.

20:39:07 WE'LL BEGIN WITH LISA DANS.

20:39:11  LISA DANZ.

20:39:12 WELCOME, LISA.

20:39:16 >> THANK YOU.

20:39:16 HI.

20:39:18 MY NAME IS LISA DANZ.

20:39:22 I'M A FREMONT RESIDENT LIVING IN THE SUNDALE NEIGHBORHOOD AND I'M A RENTER.

20:39:26 AND I WANT TO THANK PLANNERS WAYLAND LI AND COURTNEY PAL FOR THEIR 
20:39:29 PRESENTATION AND FOR INCORPORATING THE FEEDBACK FROM THE COMMISSIONS ABOUT 
20:39:33 CREATIVELY FINDING WAYS TO ACHIEVE OUR AFFORDABLE HOUSING NUMBERS.

20:39:40 AND WHILE WE ARE REQUIRED TO TAKE CARE OF ANALYZING CONSTRAINTS AND TRYING TO 
20:39:43 FIGURE OUT WHAT'S STOPPING US FROM BUILDING HOUSING, I WANT TO MAKE SURE 
20:39:49 THAT WE'RE GOING BEYOND THE MINIMUM AND REALLY TARGETING HAVING A HOUSING 
20:39:53 ELEMENT THAT WILL ALLOW US TO ACHIEVE OUR RHNA NUMBERS THIS CYCLE.

20:39:57 I DON'T THINK ANYBODY IS HAPPY ABOUT THE FACT THAT IN THE PAST CYCLE, WE 
20:40:01 ARE WAY, WAY BEHIND ON ALL OF OUR AFFORDABLE HOUSING NUMBERS, SO I'D 
20:40:07 LIKE TO -- LET'S BE PROUD A YEAR FROM NOW OS TO WHAT WE'VE ACTUALLY BUILT 
20:40:11 AND FIGURE OUT NOW WHAT WE NEED TO PUT IN THE HOUSING ELEMENT TO MAKE THAT 
20:40:11 POSSIBLE.

20:40:16 AND I THINK PART OF THAT IS  ASKING OURSELVES WHAT IS THE CITY DOING 
20:40:18 THAT'S MAKING HOUSING SO EXPENSIVE?

20:40:21 BECAUSE SUBSIDY MONEY IS IMPORTANT BUT IT'S LIMITED.

20:40:25 WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH SUBSIDY MONEY TO ACHIEVE ALL OF OUR AFFORDABLE HOUSING 
20:40:29 NUMBERS, SO WE NEED TO ASK OURSELVES HOW FAR WE CAN GO TOWARD ALSO MAKING 
20:40:32 THE UNSUBSIDIZED HOUSING AFFORDABLE.

20:40:38 YOU ALREADY HEARD ABOUT PARKING, I THINK REMOVING PARKING MINIMUMS IS A 
20:40:41 GOOD IDEA SINCE THAT CAN PUSH UP THE COST OF A PROJECT.

20:40:42 SO THAT'S BASICALLY MY POINT.

20:40:46 I JUST REALLY HOPE THAT WE CAN ACHIEVE ALL OF OUR RHNA NUMBERS THIS YEAR.

20:40:47 THANK YOU.

20:40:50 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

20:40:52 NEXT SPEAKER IS BLAIR BEEKMAN.

20:40:55 >> HI.

20:40:56 BLAIR BEEKMAN.

20:40:57 THANKS A LOT FOR THIS ITEM.

20:41:05 I GUESS TO START, I NOTICED A FEW TIMES TONIGHT YOUR STAFF, GOVERNMENT STAFF 
20:41:12 MENTIONED THE IDEA THAT BY 2030, 40 AND 50, YOU KNOW, THERE'S GOING TO BE SOME 
20:41:14 PRETTY LARGE NUMBERS IN HOUSING IN FREEDOM.

20:41:16 AND YOU HAVE TO START CONSIDERING THAT.

20:41:24 I USED TO ATTEND FUSD PUBLIC MEETINGS THIS PAST FEW YEARS.

20:41:28 THEY WERE REALLY PREPARING FOR THE NEXT FEW YEARS POSSIBLY THROUGH THE NEXT -- 
20:41:32 THROUGH THIS DECADE THAT HOUSING NUMBERS WERE ACTUALLY GOING TO KIND OF 
20:41:32 GO DOWN.

20:41:40 POPULATIONS ARE APPARENTLY  LEAVING FREMONT AND THE BAY  AREA.

20:41:46 CAN YOU, I DON'T KNOW, LINE THAT UP AND -- THE POSITIVE REPORTS, INTERESTING 
20:41:51 REPORTS BEING GIVEN HERE COMPARED WITH WHAT WAS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED THAT 
20:41:55 POPULATION NUMBERS ARE GOING TO BE GOING DOWN OVERALL IN THE NEXT FEW 
20:41:56 YEARS IN FREMONT AND THE BAY AREA.

20:42:03 A COUPLE OTHER ITEMS, AS GREAT WORK YOU'VE DONE WITH RHNA AT THIS TIME, I 
20:42:07 THANK YOU FORM WHAT WE CAN BE PREPARING FOR IN THE NEXT THREE YEARS WITH 
20:42:10 REALLY AFFORDABLE HOUSING IDEAS.

20:42:11 THERE'S MORE THAN JUST RHNA.

20:42:13 I LEARNED HOW TO TALK ABOUT THOSE THINGS.

20:42:18 THERE'S QUITE A FEW THAT ARE DEVELOPING EXPERIMENTAL FUNDING WAYS AND SOURCES 
20:42:22 THAT ARE REALLY INTERESTING AND IMPORTANT, AND OF COURSE SAN FRANCISCO 
20:42:30 BAY AREA WAS NOT REALLY A PART OF A WHOLE NEW MIXED INCOME STUDY THAT THE 
20:42:38 REST OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND MAJOR METROPOLITAN CITIES ARE, THE 
20:42:42 FLEXIBILITY, IF YOU START WORKING ON IT MORE, I THINK YOU'LL SEE AMAZING 
20:42:43 THINGS OPEN UP.

20:42:48 AND I GUESS JUST TO QUICKLY CONCLUDE FROM MY PUBLIC COMMENT, IT'S MY HOPE 
20:42:56 THAT WE CAN CONSIDER ENDING THE WAR BY THE END OF THIS APRIL.

20:42:58 THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.

20:42:59 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

20:43:01 NEXT SPEAKER IS KELLY ABREU.

20:43:02 WELCOME, KELLY.

20:43:08 >> YEAH, I'M A LITTLE BIT DISAPPOINTED WITH THE TONE OF THE PRESENTATION 
20:43:08 TODAY.

20:43:15 IT GIVES A HIGH LEVEL 35,000-FOOT OVERVIEW, BUT IT GLOSSES OVER, IT 
20:43:17 LACKS DETAIL ON WHERE TO PUT THE HIGH-DENSITY HOUSING.

20:43:19 YOU KNOW, THAT'S THE HARD PART.

20:43:24 WE CAN SIT HERE AND TALK ABOUT SLIDES AND PROJECTIONS AND NUMBERS AND GRAPHS 
20:43:28 AND CHARTS AND THINGS, BUT WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO PUT THE HIGH-DENSITY 
20:43:31 HOUSING, AND WHEN ALL THE NEIGHBORINGS ARE COMPLAINING?

20:43:33 THAT'S THE HARD PART.

20:43:37 WHEN IT COMES TO RHNA, FREMONT HAS NOT DONE BADLY ON RHNA.

20:43:41 NEARLY HALF OF ALL THE CITIES AND COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA FAILED TO MEET 
20:43:44 EACH AND EVERY CATEGORY OF RHNA.

20:43:52 NOW FREMONT IS NOT IN THAT HALF THAT FAILED TO MEET EACH AND EVERY CATEGORY 
20:43:59 OF RHNA SO LET'S NOT BEAT OURSELVES UP TOO MUCH ABOUT RHNA, GET TOO FIXATED 
20:44:02 ON EVERY SINGLE MEETING, CHECKING EVERY BOX.

20:44:10 3% OF THE CITIES AND COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA CHECKED EVERY BOX ON RHNA.

20:44:12 3%.

20:44:25 ONE THING THAT THE CITY IS DOING THAT THE PLAN HAS FAILED TO DO, THE LAND 
20:44:29 USE PLAN, THERE'S A WHOLE BUNCH OF GENERAL PLAN LAND USES.

20:44:35 THIS THING JUST RUNS -- PRETENDS LIKE YOU'RE GOING TO PUT ALL THE 
20:44:38 DEVELOPMENT ALONG THE CORRIDOR ALONG FREMONT BOULEVARD.

20:44:43 THE GENERAL PLAN CALLED FOR ACTIVATING THE COMMERCIAL COUNCIL CENTERS OF 
20:44:48  IRVINGTON WARM SPRINGS, MISSION SAN JOSÉ, THROUGH COMMERCIAL TOWN CENTERS, 
20:44:52 AND THAT INVOLVES SOME HOUSING, A LOT OF HOUSING AS PART OF  THAT.

20:44:54 YOU'RE NOT PUTTING ANYTHING IN NILES.

20:44:58 YOU'RE NOT PROPOSING TO PUT ANYTHING IN MISSION SAN JOSÉ.

20:45:00 YOU'RE IGNORING THE TOWN  CENTERS.

20:45:02 YOU'RE NOT ACTIVATING THEM.

20:45:03 THANK YOU.

20:45:13 >> Mayor Mei: I BELIEVE THAT IS OUR LAST SPEAKER, BUT I THINK THAT WE'RE 
20:45:18 DUE FOR A BREAK, JUST TO LET YOU KNOW, FOR OUR STENOCAPTIONERS, AND I WANT TO 
20:45:19 BE COURTEOUS OF THEM.

20:45:20 AND THEIR TIMING.

20:45:25 AND I THINK THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE MORE THAN A FIVE-MINUTE CONVERSATION.

20:45:28 SO I SEE THAT WE'LL HAVE SOME COUNCILMEMBERS SPEAKING SO I'M GOING 
20:45:32 TO TAKE A QUICK PAUSE FOR A FIVE-MINUTE BREAK TO RETURN FOR THAT.

20:45:37 SO I'D ASK THAT YOU TURN OFF YOUR VIDEO AND YOUR MICS AT THIS TIME, AND WE'LL 
20:45:38 BE BACK IN FIVE MINUTES, PLEASE.

20:45:44 






20:46:01 



20:51:53 [ RECESS ]

20:51:54 >> Mayor Mei:   WELCOME BACK.

20:52:23 WE'LL PROBABLY BEGIN WITH 

20:52:25 COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN.

20:52:28 YOU HAD YOUR HAND RAISED.

20:52:31 COURTNEY, THANK YOU.

20:52:37 SO AS WE RETURN NOW, WE'LL BEGIN 

20:52:38 WITH COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN.

20:52:40 FOR YOUR COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS.

20:52:40 THANK YOU.

20:52:44 >> Councilmember Kassan:   THANK 

20:52:46 YOU, AND THANK YOU TO STAFF, AS 

20:52:48 USUAL YOU KNOW JUST SUCH A 

20:52:49 PROFESSIONAL JOB ON THIS.

20:52:52 AND I AM PROUD TO BE IN A CITY 

20:52:55 THAT REALLY TAKES THIS PROCESS 

20:52:55 VERY SERIOUSLY.

20:52:59 AND I JUST HAVE TO SAY THAT I 

20:53:00 FIND THE WHOLE THING VERY 

20:53:02 BIZARRE, AND OF COURSE THIS IS 

20:53:04 NOT THE FAULT OF OUR STAFF, IT'S 

20:53:08 REALLY A STATE ISSUE, WHICH IS 

20:53:10 THAT IT'S CONSIDERED A SUCCESS 

20:53:14 WHEN WE BUILD WAY MORE 

20:53:16 MARKET-RATE HOUSING THAN IS IN 

20:53:19 OUR ALLOCATION AND WAY LESS 

20:53:21 AFFORDABLE HOUSING.

20:53:23 AS KELLY SAID, OH YOU KNOW WE'RE 

20:53:25 DOING WELL BECAUSE WE'RE 

20:53:27 BUILDING SO MUCH OF THE MARKET 

20:53:27 RATE HOUSING.

20:53:30 I ACTUALLY DON'T SEE -- I SEE IT 

20:53:35 AS A LIMITED -- IT'S A -- I SEE 

20:53:39  

20:53:41 IT AS A ZERO SUM GAME.

20:53:43 WE HAVE TO BUILD MORE MARKET 

20:53:45 RATE HOUSING IN ORDER TO BUILD 

20:53:46 MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING BECAUSE 

20:53:48 OF THE IN LIEU FEES BUT IF YOU 

20:53:49 LOOK AT THE DATA THAT WE HAVE 

20:53:54 GATHERED WITH OUR CONSULTANTS, 

20:53:56 EVERY TIME WE BUILD A MARKET 

20:53:59 RATE UNIT IN FREMONT IT CREATES 

20:54:01 THE DEMAND FOR MORE FOOTBALL 

20:54:03 UNITS, BECAUSE EVERY MARKET RATE 

20:54:04 UNIT CREATES THE NEED FOR PEOPLE 

20:54:06 WHO ARE NOT ABLE TO AFFORD 

20:54:08 MARKET RATE HOUSING TO BE ABLE 

20:54:09 TO LIVE IN FREMONT.

20:54:11 AND OUR IN LIEU FEES ARE LOWER 

20:54:13 THAN THE AMOUNT OF MONEY WE 

20:54:14 WOULD NEED TO BE ABLE TO BUILD 

20:54:18 ALL OF THE UNITS THAT ARE NEEDED 

20:54:21 EVERY TIME WE BUILD MORE MARKET 

20:54:23 RATE HOUSING.

20:54:24 SO I DON'T BELIEVE THAT WE 

20:54:26 SHOULD BE SO PROUD THAT WE'VE 

20:54:29 BUILT FOUR TIMES AS MUCH MARKET 

20:54:32 RATE HOUSING AS IS IN OUR RHNA 

20:54:32 NUMBERS.

20:54:34 I THINK THAT ACTUALLY RESULTS IN 

20:54:38 US BEING ABLE TO BUILD LESS 

20:54:40 AFFORDABLE HOUSING BECAUSE IT'S 

20:54:42 TAKING UP LAND THAT COULD BE 

20:54:44 USED FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING, AND 

20:54:47 IT'S CREATING MORE NEED FOR 

20:54:47 AFFORDABLE HOUSING.

20:54:49 SO WE'RE GETTING MORE AND MORE 

20:54:50 BEHIND.

20:54:51 SO THIS IS JUST -- I FEEL LIKE 

20:54:53 EVERY TIME I THINK ABOUT RHNA 

20:54:57 AND THE RHNA PROCESS I FEEL LIKE 

20:54:58 I'M IN -- I'VE GONE THROUGH 

20:54:59 LOOKING GLASS.

20:55:01 AND I JUST I CANNOT UNDERSTAND 

20:55:03 HOW THE STATE CONTINUES TO THINK 

20:55:04 THAT THIS IS A GOOD WAY TO 

20:55:06 MANAGE OUR AFFORDABLE HOUSING 

20:55:06 CRISIS.

20:55:13 BUT ANYWAY, THIS IS NOT THE 

20:55:15 FAULT OF OUR STAFF.

20:55:20 I AM PROUD OF HOW OUR STAFF, 

20:55:21 THAT WE ARE ABLE TO ACCOMMODATE 

20:55:23 ALL THE NUMBERS WE ARE ASKED TO 

20:55:24 ACCOMMODATE.

20:55:24 THANK YOU.

20:55:25 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

20:55:40 ARE THERE ANY OTHER COMMENTS 

20:55:40 FROM THE COUNCIL?

20:55:42 THIS IS A REPORT, NOT AN ACTION 

20:55:43 ITEM TODAY BECAUSE I KNOW WE 

20:55:45 HAVE AN UPDATE USUALLY.

20:55:47 CAN I JUST GET THAT CLARIFIED 

20:55:48 FROM THE STAFF IF THAT'S THE 

20:55:53 CASE?

20:55:53 >> Planner Pullen:   THAT'S 

20:55:56 CORRECT MAYOR, THIS IS AN 

20:55:58 INFORMATIONAL ITEM, WE'LL BE 

20:55:59 BACK WITH THE HOUSING ELEMENT 

20:55:59 LATER.

20:56:01 >> Mayor Mei:   THE INFORMATION 

20:56:03 IS AVAILABLE, THE LINK AND 

20:56:04 DETAILS AVAILABLE ONLINE, 

20:56:06 BECAUSE IT WASN'T EARLIER.

20:56:07 JUST TO --

20:56:07 >> THAT'S CORRECT.

20:56:11 >> Mayor Mei:   WONDERFUL.

20:56:12 BECAUSE I KNOW THERE WAS A LOT 

20:56:14 OF INFORMATION TO DIGEST, I 

20:56:15 APPRECIATE IT.

20:56:17 I SEE SOME COUNCILMEMBERS HANDS 

20:56:19 ARE NOW RAISED.

20:56:20 VICE MAYOR SALWAN.

20:56:21 >> Councilmember Salwan:   I 

20:56:22 JUST WANTED TO SAY IF WE COULD 

20:56:24 GET IT OUT TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC 

20:56:26 I THINK, YOU KNOW, WE HAVE ALL 

20:56:27 OF OUR COMMISSIONS AND 

20:56:29 EVERYTHING.

20:56:31 BUT EVERY TIME WE DO THIS, WE DO 

20:56:33 THIS OUTRAGE BUT SOMEHOW PEOPLE 

20:56:35 COMPLAIN THAT THEY DIDN'T KNOW 

20:56:35 BIT.

20:56:38 SO IF WE CAN DO EVEN MORE FARCE 

20:56:40  AS FAR 

20:56:43 AS OUR NEWSLETTER, WEEKLY 

20:56:45 BULLETINS, SOCIAL MEDIA, KIND OF 

20:56:49 OVERDO IT, IF WE CAN DO AS MUCH 

20:56:53 AS OUTREACH AS POSSIBLE, WHAT 

20:56:55 THEY WOULD LIKE TO SEE BUILT AND 

20:56:56 OF COURSE WE DON'T BUILD 

20:56:58 ANYTHING, ALL WE DO IS, WE 

20:57:01 ACCOMMODATE THE ZONING.

20:57:02 AND SO ONE OF THE LARGER ISSUES 

20:57:06 IS, THESE AFFORDABLE HOUSING 

20:57:08 PROJECTS COST A LOT OF MONEY.

20:57:10 AVERAGE UNIT RUNS ABOUT 

20:57:11 $800,000.

20:57:12 SO I THINK THAT IS ONE OF THE 

20:57:13 BIG ISSUES THAT WE HAVE TO LOOK 

20:57:14 AT.

20:57:15 AS OF NOW WE DON'T HAVE PEOPLE 

20:57:17 TRYING TO BUILD 100% AFFORDABLE 

20:57:19 HOUSING, IT DOES REQUIRE A 

20:57:21 SUBSIDY, DOES REQUIRE A WILLING 

20:57:23 PERSON TO STEP UP, PUT SOME 

20:57:25 MONEY DOWN, WHETHER THAT'S THE 

20:57:28 CITY, WHETHER THAT'S THE IN LIEU 

20:57:30 FEES OR COUNTY OR STATE, BUT 

20:57:32 SOMEBODY NEEDS TO PUT THAT 

20:57:32 EFFORT.

20:57:34 AND OF COURSE, THE DEVELOPERS 

20:57:36 ARE THE ONES THAT ACTUALLY MAKE 

20:57:39 IT HAPPEN.

20:57:40 YOU KNOW, FOR A LONG TIME WE 

20:57:41 TALKED A LOT ABOUT AFFORDABLE 

20:57:43 HOUSING BUT WE DID NOTHING.

20:57:44 WE JUST TALKED.

20:57:46 OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS WE 

20:57:48 ACTUALLY CHANGED SOME POLICIES 

20:57:49 THAT INCENTIVIZE AFFORDABLE 

20:57:50 HOUSING.

20:57:52 SO WE REDUCE SOME FEES SO WE CAN 

20:57:55 MAKE IT EASIER FOR MORE 

20:57:56 AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS TO 

20:57:56 BE BUILT.

20:57:58 SO I THINK THAT WE ARE 

20:57:59 DELIVERING SOME TANGIBLE 

20:58:00 SOLUTIONS.

20:58:02 AND WE JUST NEED TO KEEP DOING 

20:58:03 MORE.

20:58:04 SO THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SAY.

20:58:05 THANK YOU.

20:58:06 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

20:58:07 NEXT IS COUNCILMEMBER COX.

20:58:09 >> Councilmember Cox:   YES, I 

20:58:13 WAS GOING TO ECHO WHAT 

20:58:15 COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN HAD 

20:58:17 MENTIONED AND JUST INCREASE THE 

20:58:19 FREQUENCY OF THE COMMUNICATIONS 

20:58:20 ABOUT HOW THIS PROJECT AND WHAT 

20:58:22 IT MEANS TO THE PUBLIC AND HOW 

20:58:26 IT'S GOING TO IMPACT THE CITY 

20:58:28 AND ITS RESIDENTS AND DOING A 

20:58:30 LITTLE MORE OUTREACH.

20:58:31 BUT MORE FREQUENTLY EVERY WEEK 

20:58:33 OR SOMETHING UNTIL WE NEED THE 

20:58:35 INFORMATION, JUST TO REMIND 

20:58:35 PEOPLE.

20:58:37 BECAUSE A LOT OF INFORMATION 

20:58:40 DOES GET LOST IN SPAM FOLDERS, 

20:58:42 ESPECIALLY IF WE'RE DOING IT BY 

20:58:42 E-MAIL.

20:58:44 BUT -- AND ESPECIALLY 

20:58:47 OUTREACHING TO SOME OF THE MORE 

20:58:48 DIVERSE COMMUNITIES.

20:58:49 AND IF THERE'S SOME WAY TO BE 

20:58:53 ABLE TO COMMUNICATE IN THE 

20:58:56 DIFFERENT NATIVE LANGUAGES TO 

20:58:57 HELP BUILD THE COMMUNICATIONS 

20:59:00 STRONGER TO OUR DIVERSE 

20:59:01 COMMUNITY THAT WOULD BE 

20:59:01 WONDERFUL.

20:59:05 AND INCLUDING SIGN LANGUAGE FOR 

20:59:08 THE DEAF COMMUNITY AS WELL SINCE 

20:59:09 THEY'RE HOUSED RIGHT HERE IN 

20:59:09 FREMONT.

20:59:14 AND WELCOMING EVERYONE TO BE 

20:59:16 ABLE TO GET THAT OUT AND MAYBE 

20:59:17 EVEN SHARING IT WITH OUR SCHOOLS 

20:59:19 TO LET THEM KNOW ABOUT IT AS 

20:59:20 WELL.

20:59:25 WE TOUCH THE STUDENTS, WE TOUCH 

20:59:26 THE FAMILIES AS WELL.

20:59:28 SO ALL MEANS NECESSARY, IF 

20:59:30 THERE'S SOME WAY WE COULD DO A 

20:59:33 LOT OF COLLABORATION WITH OUR 

20:59:36 OTHER ELECTED OFFICIALS IN THE 

20:59:39 AREA AS WELL AS THE DIFFERENT 

20:59:41 ORGANIZATIONS, WOULD BE 

20:59:41 WONDERFUL.

20:59:47 >> Mayor Mei:   COUNCILMEMBER 

20:59:49 KENG.

20:59:49 >> Councilmember Keng:   THANK 

20:59:50 YOU MADAM MAYOR.

20:59:52 WANT TO THANK THE STAFF FOR 

20:59:54 PRESENTATION AND DO SEE THE 

20:59:56 PERCENTAGE OF HOME OWNERSHIP HAS 

20:59:58 GONE DOWN OVER THE YEARS, 

20:59:59 ESPECIALLY FOR YOUNGER 

21:00:00 RESIDENTS.

21:00:02 AND FREMONT WE'RE DOING OUR PART 

21:00:06 IN BUILDING THE, ESPECIALLY THE 

21:00:10 LAST TEN YEARS, AND WHILE OTHER 

21:00:12 CITIES ARE NOT, YOU KNOW, 

21:00:13 BUILDING THOSE UNITS WE ARE 

21:00:14 CREATING MORE TRAFFIC ON THE 

21:00:16 ROAD.

21:00:20 SO I DO AGREE THAT, YOU KNOW, WE 

21:00:21 NEED TO DID MORE OUTREACH, 

21:00:23 PERHAPS PUT OUT THE REPORT ON 

21:00:24 THE TOP OF OF OUR CITY WEBSITE.

21:00:26 SO IT IS MORE PROMINENT FOR 

21:00:28 PEOPLE TO SEE AND SEE SOME OF 

21:00:30 THESE, YOU KNOW, NUMBERS TO KIND 

21:00:32 OF SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES.

21:00:37 AND YEAH, IN OTHER OUTREACHING 

21:00:39 MECHANISMS THAT WE CAN EMPLOY, 

21:00:40 THAT WOULD BE GREAT.

21:00:43 THANK YOU.

21:00:44 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

21:00:46 NEXT IS COUNCILMEMBER SHAO.

21:00:56 >> Councilmember Shao:   THANK 

21:00:58 YOU, MADAM MAYOR.

21:01:00 I NOTICE THAT WE ARE STILL AT A 

21:01:11 VERY EARLY SAGE IN BUILDING 

21:01:13 ADUS, THE NUMBERS ARE STILL 

21:01:14 FAIRLY LOW.

21:01:15 I THINK THAT SHOULD BE THE AREA 

21:01:18 WE CAN LOOK INTO TO ENCOURAGE 

21:01:20 MORE ADUS, I UNDERSTAND AND I 

21:01:23 APPRECIATE THAT OUR CITY STAFF 

21:01:26 HAS ALREADY STREAMLINED THE 

21:01:28 REVIEW AND APPROVAL PROCESS FOR 

21:01:33 ADUS, AND IN THIS CASE, WE JUST 

21:01:37 WANT TO FURTHER PROMOTE THE 

21:01:39 INFORMATION TO THE PUBLIC SO 

21:01:42 THAT, FOR PEOPLE ESPECIALLY 

21:01:44 PEOPLE WITH LARGE LOT OF SINGLE 

21:01:47 HOUSE, THEY CAN ALSO LOOK INTO 

21:01:52 BUILDING ADUS, TO HELP THE CITY 

21:01:53 TO PROVIDE MORE AFFORDABLE 

21:01:53 HOUSING.

21:01:58 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

21:01:58 COUNCILMEMBER JONES.

21:02:00 >> Councilmember Jones:   THANK 

21:02:02 YOU, MADAM MAYOR.

21:02:03 I WON'T REPEAT WHAT THE OTHER 

21:02:04 COUNCILMEMBERS SAID.

21:02:06 I THINK THAT'S ALL BEEN COVERED.

21:02:07 I JUST WANTED TO TAKE THE 

21:02:09 OPPORTUNITY TO THANK STAFF.

21:02:11 THIS IS AN INCREDIBLY COMPLEX 

21:02:12 ISSUE.

21:02:14 AND THEY ARE DOWN IN THE WEEDS 

21:02:16 WITH THIS PROBLEM.

21:02:18 AND HOPEFULLY WE'RE GOING TO SEE 

21:02:20 WHAT THEIR RESULTS ARE IN A 

21:02:22 COUPLE OF MONTHS WHEN THEY BRING 

21:02:23 THE FINAL PRODUCT BACK TO US.

21:02:25 BUT I THINK WE'RE TAKING STEPS 

21:02:27 IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND WE 

21:02:29 NEED TO CONTINUE TO DO MORE.

21:02:30 THANK YOU.

21:02:33 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

21:02:35 VICE MAYOR SALWAN DID YOU HAVE 

21:02:36 ADDITIONAL COMMENTS?

21:02:37 >> Councilmember Salwan:   I HAD 

21:02:40 A QUICK QUESTION, I WANTED TO 

21:02:41 THANK COUNCILMEMBER SHAO FOR 

21:02:43 MENTIONING ADUS.

21:02:44 LAST TIME WE MENTIONED THAT ADUS 

21:02:47 WERE NOT COUNTED FOR AFFORDABLE 

21:02:48 HOUSING.

21:02:50 IS THAT STILL THE KAY?

21:02:53 WHAT ARE THEY CLASSIFIED FOR, IS 

21:02:56 IT ADUS, AFFORDABLE HOUSING, HOW 

21:02:58 DO YOU CLASSIFY IT, TO WE GET 

21:02:59 ANY CREDIT?

21:03:00 >> AT THIS TIME BECAUSE WE ARE 

21:03:02 NOT DEED RESTRICTED ADUS ARE NOT 

21:03:04 COUNTED TOWARDS OUR LOWER INCOME 

21:03:05 TARGETS.

21:03:06 I'LL POINT OUT THAT IN 

21:03:08 COLLABORATION WITH OTHER 

21:03:10 JURISDICTIONS IN THE REGION, WE 

21:03:16 ARE TRYING TO GET APPROVAL FROM 

21:03:20 HCD, METHODOLOGY TO BEGIN TO 

21:03:22 COUNT ADUS TOWARDS OUR LOW 

21:03:23 INCOME CATEGORIES BASED ON DATA 

21:03:24 THAT'S BEEN COLLECTED.

21:03:26 SO IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'RE 

21:03:28 GOING TO TRY TO DO FOR THE 

21:03:29 UPCOMING HOUSING ELEMENT AND BE 

21:03:32 AIL TO GET CREDIT FOR ADUS AT 

21:03:33 THOSE LOWER INCOME CATEGORIES.

21:03:36 AND THEN DEPENDING ON TIMING 

21:03:38 POSSIBLY SEEK TO RETROACTIVELY 

21:03:40 GET CREDIT FOR THEM FOR THE 

21:03:40 CYCLE.

21:03:43 THAT IS SOMETHING WE ARE 

21:03:43 EXPLORING.

21:03:46 >> Councilmember Salwan:   THANK 

21:03:47 YOU.

21:03:48 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK THE STAFF 

21:03:49 FOR THIS INFORMATION.

21:03:51 I DEFINITELY KNOW I WANTED TO 

21:03:52 THANK OUR PLANNING DEPARTMENT AS 

21:03:54 WELL AS OUR COMMISSIONERS FOR 

21:03:55 THEIR FEEDBACK AND I KNOW THAT 

21:03:57 SITTING ON THE DISCUSSIONS FOR 

21:03:58 THE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES 

21:04:00 AND OTHER MUNICIPALITIES, WE'VE 

21:04:03 TALKED ABOUT TRYING TO FIND WAYS 

21:04:04 BECAUSE WE'VE LOOKED IN THE PAST 

21:04:06 COUPLE OF YEARS BUSY BUILDING 

21:04:08 AFFORDABLE BY DESIGN AND 

21:04:09 CERTAINLY THAT'S ONE OF THE 

21:04:11 CONCEPTS BEHIND THE ADUS IN 

21:04:12 TERMS OF THESE QUOTE UNQUOTE 

21:04:15 ORIGINALLY CALLED GRANNY UNITS 

21:04:17 OR ACCESSORY DWELLING UNITS TO 

21:04:18 ALLOW THE ACCESSIBILITY, WHEN 

21:04:19 YOU LOOK AT THE DIFFERENT 

21:04:21 MEASURES THAT ARE PUT IN PLACE 

21:04:22 THAT'S IF WE'RE GOING TO BE 

21:04:25 BUILDING THOSE MORE TARGETED 

21:04:26 HOUSING FOR REACHING THAT 

21:04:28 COMMUNITY, THEN I THINK IT MAKES 

21:04:29 SENSE THAT WE WOULD TRY TO GET 

21:04:33 SOME CREDIT WHETHER IT'S DIRECT 

21:04:35 OR FORMULA DRIVEN I THINK THAT 

21:04:36 WOULD ALLOW US FOR SOME OF THAT 

21:04:37 UNDERSTANDING.

21:04:39 I THINK ALSO LOOKING AT THE 

21:04:41 CORRIDORS AND I'M GLAD TO KNOW 

21:04:42 JUST FOR THE PEOPLE I THINK 

21:04:44 SOMETIMES ARE NOT AWARE WHEN IT 

21:04:46 COMES TO THE PLANNED DISTRICTS 

21:04:49 AND AS WELL THE TRANSIT ORIENTED 

21:04:51 DEVELOPMENT, A LOT OF THEM WERE 

21:04:52 CHALLENGED BECAUSE THE LAND USE 

21:04:54 IS NOT JUST UP TO OURSELVES AS A 

21:04:57 COUNCIL OR TO MAKE THAT 

21:04:58 DETERMINATION UNLESS WE ARE 

21:04:59 MAKING A CHANGE IN THE LAND USE 

21:05:00 BECAUSE MANY OF THOSE WERE 

21:05:01 PROPERTIES THAT WERE ENTITLED 

21:05:04 LONG TIME AGO.

21:05:05 WHETHER IT'S THROUGH THE GENERAL 

21:05:06 PLAN AND I THINK THAT'S 

21:05:08 SOMETHING I WAS GOING TO ASK YOU 

21:05:09 TO COMMENT ON.

21:05:11 I KNOW I PARTICIPATED IN THE 

21:05:12 LAST GENERAL PLAN AMENDMENT AND 

21:05:14 THAT TOOK SIGNIFICANT OUTREACH 

21:05:15 BOTH TO THE PUBLIC A COUPLE 

21:05:17 YEARS PRIOR TO OUR ACTUAL 

21:05:19 ADOPTION AND THAT WAS LAST 

21:05:21 ADOPTED IN 2011.

21:05:23 AND WE DID DO OUR HOUSING 

21:05:25 ELEMENT PROGRESS REPORT AND WE 

21:05:27 HAVE GOT ELEMENT UPDATES.

21:05:29 BUT CAN YOU COMMENT AT ALL WHEN 

21:05:30 THE NEXT ONE WILL BE COMING UP 

21:05:32 AND WHEN WE WILL BEGIN THAT 

21:05:35 OUTREACH?

21:05:37 >> Planner Pullen:   MAYOR, I 

21:05:39 SEE DAN ON HERE AS WELL, I'M 

21:05:40 MUTED.

21:05:42 THIS HOUSING ELEMENT GOES FROM 

21:05:44 2023 TO 2031.

21:05:46 AND THE AMOUNT OF HOUSING THAT'S 

21:05:47 PROPOSED TO BE ADDED IS WELL 

21:05:50 WITHIN OUR CURRENT GROWTH 

21:05:52 PROJECTION FOR THE CURRENT 

21:05:53 GENERAL PLAN.

21:05:54 AND SO THAT'S THE BIG PICTURE.

21:05:57 >> Mayor Mei:   OKAY SO ARE 

21:05:59 THERE ANY PLANS TO AMEND OR 

21:06:01 REVISIT THE GENERAL PLAN AT ALL?

21:06:02 BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH IT'S WITHIN 

21:06:04 THE ENTITLEMENT OF WHAT WE'RE 

21:06:06 LOOKING AT TO BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE 

21:06:07 AND ACCOMPLISH THE GOALS THAT 

21:06:09 WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IN TERMS OF 

21:06:10 MAKING GREATER INROADS AND I DO 

21:06:12 WANT TO THANK STAFF AND THE 

21:06:13 COMMUNITY FOR THEIR SUPPORT FOR 

21:06:15 THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS AS YOU 

21:06:16 SAW PARTICULARLY ON THAT ONE 

21:06:17 SLIDE THAT DEMONSTRATED THAT WE 

21:06:19 HAVE ALMOST DOUBLED THE AMOUNT 

21:06:20 OF HOUSING.

21:06:21 AND THAT'S A RECORD NUMBER FOR 

21:06:24 OUR CITY'S HISTORY FOR LOW AND 

21:06:26 AFFORDABLE HOUSING, BUILT, BUT 

21:06:28 WE STILL WANT TO DO MORE.

21:06:29 AND I THINK TO THAT POINT 

21:06:30 SEVERAL OF THE COUNCILMEMBERS 

21:06:31 HAVE ADDRESSED THAT.

21:06:45 >> SO CURRENTLY MAYOR MEI, THERE 

21:06:47 IS NO CURRENT UPDATE FOR THE 

21:06:48 GENERAL PLAN.

21:06:50 BUT IN TERMS OF A COMPREHENSIVE 

21:06:51 UPDATE WE DON'T HAVE ANY 

21:06:55 TIMETABLE FOR STARTING THAT 

21:06:56 REALLY.

21:06:57 WHEN THE LAST GENERAL PLAN WAS 

21:06:59 ADOPTED IT WAS ENVISIONED THAT 

21:07:01 IT WOULD TAKE US THROUGH YEAR 

21:07:02 2030.

21:07:05 AND WE'RE SORT OF KIND OF 

21:07:09 MONITORING THAT AND AS LONG AS 

21:07:11 THE CURRENT GENERAL PLAN HAS 

21:07:13 SUFFICIENT CAPACITY FOR GROWTH 

21:07:17 THAT IS ENVISIONED, THERE'S NO 

21:07:19 SORT OF LEGAL REQUIREMENT TO 

21:07:20 UPDATE IT.

21:07:23 >> Mayor Mei:   VERY CURIOUS TO 

21:07:24 SEE AS THERE WAS A SPEAKER 

21:07:26 EARLIER THIS EVENING WHO TALKED 

21:07:27 ABOUT THE CHANGES IN POPULATION 

21:07:30 THAT WE PREDICT AND WE'VE SEEN 

21:07:32 MANY DIFFERENT ONES FROM SILICON 

21:07:34 VALLEY LEADERSHIP GROUP AND IN 

21:07:35 THE MEDIA CERTAINLY FROM OUR 

21:07:36 SCHOOL DISTRICT BUT I THINK THE 

21:07:38 SCHOOL DISTRICT IS MORE TIED NOT 

21:07:40 JUST TO THE POPULATION GROWTH 

21:07:41 BUT TO THE BIRTH RATE.

21:07:43 THEREFORE WE ARE SEEING SOME OF 

21:07:45 THAT IMPACT AND CERTAINLY WE ARE 

21:07:47 EAGERLY WATCHING AND SEEING THE 

21:07:48 IMPACT OF THE CHANGES IN THE 

21:07:50 WORKFORCE IN TERMS OF NOW HOW 

21:07:52 PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO DO NOR 

21:07:59  MORE 

21:08:02 DISTANCE-WORKING, THANK YOU TO 

21:08:04 STAFF FOR ALL YOUR COMMENTS AND 

21:08:06 YOUR INSIGHTS, VERY VALUABLE TO 

21:08:09 US AND THANK YOU TO TO THE TEAM, 

21:08:11 IT'S MUCH APPRECIATED AND 

21:08:13 HOPEFULLY HOMEKEY AND OTHER 

21:08:14 AREAS ARE HOPEFULLY OTHER AREAS 

21:08:17 WE CAN LOOK AT WAYS TO ADDRESS 

21:08:19 THE HOUSING NEEDS THAT WE SEE 

21:08:20 ESPECIALLY ON THE AFFORDABLE 

21:08:21 ASPECT SO THANK YOU.

21:08:26 NEXT ON OUR AGENDA ITEM IS ITEM 

21:08:28 8A AND THOSE REFERRAL FOR 

21:08:29 APPOINTMENT TO ADVISORY BODIES.

21:08:32 AND I WAS WONDERING IF THERE 

21:08:34 WERE ANY COMMENTS OR SOMEBODY 

21:08:36 CAN MAKE A MOTION.

21:08:40 RAISED THEIR HAND.

21:10:00 THE COUNCILMEMBERS HAVE 

21:10:01 ATTENDED.

21:10:02 FOR COMMISSIONS.

21:10:08 I WANTED TO THANK, FIRST, VICE 

21:10:09 MAYOR SALWAN FOR COVERING AND 

21:10:12 ALSO ATTENDING, WE HAD OUR FIRST 

21:10:14 ALAMEDA COUNTY TRANSPORTATION 

21:10:16 COMMISSION IN-PERSON MEETING IN 

21:10:18 A WHILE AND WE HAD A RETREAT AND 

21:10:20 I KNOW THAT HE IS MY ALTERNATE 

21:10:22 AND HE WAS ABLE TO HELP COVER 

21:10:23 SOME OF THAT DISCUSSION AND A 

21:10:25 LOT OF THAT CONVERSATION I THINK 

21:10:28 CENTERED AROUND RACE EQUITY, AND 

21:10:31 IN TERMS OF HOW WE ARE 

21:10:31 ADDRESSING SPECIFICALLY SIMILAR 

21:10:33 TO WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT RIGHT 

21:10:35 NOW ABOUT THE HOUSING ELEMENT 

21:10:36 AND ALSO TRANSPORTATION 

21:10:38 DEVELOPMENT OF ACCESS AND USE 

21:10:41 THAT PERTAINS TO THAT.

21:10:41 VICE MAYOR SALWAN DID YOU HAVE 

21:10:43 ANYTHING ELSE TO ADD TO THAT 

21:10:44 ONE?

21:10:45 >> Councilmember Salwan:   NO, I 

21:10:46 THINK YOU REPRESENTED THAT WELL.

21:10:48 AND THE OTHER THING WAS, THE 

21:10:51 LEAGUE OF CITIES, WE HAD A 

21:10:52 DISCUSSION WITH OUR LEGISLATORS 

21:10:54 TO DISCUSS THEIR BILLS AND 

21:10:56 CURRENT ISSUES SUCH AS 

21:10:57 HOMELESSNESS AND ALL THE OTHER

21:11:04 EVERYBODY IN PERSON.

21:11:05 >> Mayor Mei:   THAT WAS 

21:11:05 WONDERFUL.

21:11:07 I'M GLAD THE LEAGUE WAS ABLE TO 

21:11:09 INVITE EVERYONE TO TALK ABOUT 

21:11:10 THE UPDATES, THE OPPORTUNITY TO 

21:11:12 COME UP HERE TO SACRAMENTO TO 

21:11:14 MAKE SOME OF THESE DISCUSSIONS
