19:05:28  HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH FOR 2021.

19:05:38  WHEREAS, HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH STARTED AS HISPANIC HERITAGE WEEK UNDER FORMER PRESIDENT LYNDON B.

19:06:06  WHEREAS, THE DIVERSE HERITAGE OF THE HISPANIC COMMUNITY HAS HAD A
19:06:12  SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN THE ECONOMY, CULTURE, EDUCATION, ALL FIELDS,
19:06:16  AND IDENTITY OF THE UNITED STATES AND MADE CONTRIBUTIONS TO
19:06:20  CITY OF FREMONT’S SUCCESS; AND WHEREAS, THE CITY OF FREMONT

>> Mayor Mei: PLEASE.
AND WELCOME.

19:08:02 >> THANK YOU, MAYOR LILY MEI.
FIRST I WOULD
19:08:05  LIKE TO THANK THE FREMONT CITY COUNCIL AND  COUNCILWOMAN TERESA COX
19:08:08  FOR THE INVITATION TO ACCEPT FREMONT'S FIRST PROCLAMATION
19:08:11  OF HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH.
ON BEHALF OF OUR
19:08:15  PROUD LATIN COMMUNITY.
MY NAME
19:08:18 I'M A PROUD LATINA
19:08:21  IMMIGRANT WITH TWO THRIVING SMALL BUSINESSES IN
19:08:24  FREMONT
19:08:27 .
BOTH BUSINESSES PROVIDE PROFESSIONAL CAREER
19:08:30  COUNSELING AND COACHING AND OUR SPECIALTY IS WORKING WITH PEOPLE WITH
19:08:34  DIFFERENT ABILITIES OR, AS WE PREFER
19:08:37  TO SAY, ARE
19:08:41  DRK IFABLED.
I AM PROUD TO BUILD A
19:08:44  TEAM OF TALENTED INDIVIDUALS WHO RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE AND NEED FOR
19:08:48  PROFESSIONAL EMPLOYMENT SERVICES TO THOSE WHO
19:08:54  DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES.
OUR NON-PROFIT'S GOAL FOR 2022 IS TO
19:08:58  EXTEND SERVICES TO THE HOMELESS, RE-ENTRY AND OTHER COMMUNITY MEMBERS WHO WANT
19:09:01  TO ADVANCE THEIR CAREERS.
I WAS BORN AND RAISED IN
19:09:04  GUATEMALA AND CAME TO THE U.S. WHEN I WAS 17 TO
19:09:07  VISIT FAMILY IN SAN FRANCISCO.

19:09:10 SINCE I DIDN'T SPEAK ENGLISH I TOOK MY FIRST STEP TO
19:09:17  -- SO WITH THE SUPPORT
19:09:20  OF MY AUNT I ENROLLED IN A PRIVATE ENGLISH AS
19:09:24  SECOND LANGUAGE SCHOOL IN SAN FRANCISCO AND IN ORDER TO PAY FOR IT, I BEGAN
19:09:27  WORKING AS A LIVE-IN NANNY WITH AN
19:09:30  AMERICAN FAMILY AND THIS IS HOW MY IMMIGRATING
19:09:33  STORY BEGAN.
I CAME FROM A MIDDLE CLASS FAMILY FROM
19:09:37  MY CITY IN GUATEMALA
19:09:40  GUATEMALA.
MY
19:09:43  GRANDFATHER WAS A GREAT BELIEVER IN SERVING THE COMMUNITY AND
19:09:46  UPLIFTING THE LESS FORTUNATE.
PASSION IS AT MY CORE IN
19:09:50  ALL THAT I DO.
FUELED BY MY LATIN ROOTS AND DESIRE TO
19:09:53  GIVE BACK, I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN APPRECIATIVE OF MY CULTURE AND
19:09:56  MY GRANDFATHER'S LEGACY AND HOW IT HAS SHAPED ME IN ALL THAT
19:09:59  I DO.
I HAVE LIVED IN FREMONT FOR 27
19:10:02  YEARS, AND I'M ENTERING MY 16TH YEAR WORKING WITH INDIVIDUALS
19:10:06  WITH DIFFERENT ABILITIES.
I LOVE OUR COMMUNITY AND HAVE ALWAYS
19:10:09  FOCUSED ON BEING A PART OF WHAT MAKES FREMONT SO SPECIAL
19:10:12  SPECIAL.
THROUGH STRONG AND LONG LASTING PARTNERSHIPS HERE IN FREMONT AND
19:10:15  THROUGHOUT THE BAY AREA, MY DREAM IS REALIZED
19:10:18  DAILY BY SUPPORTING THOSE IN NEED WITH CAREER SUCCESS AND THE
19:10:21  OPPORTUNITY TO ACHIEVE THEIR AMERICAN DREAM.
I
19:10:24  WAKE UP EVERY DAY THANKFUL AND READY TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE EVERY
19:10:28  DAY IN OUR COMMUNITY AND BEYOND.
WHAT I HAVE BEEN ABLE
19:10:31  TO ACHIEVE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE WITHOUT MY
19:10:34  EXTREMELY SUPPORTIVE FAMILY IN GUATEMALA AND HERE IN THE U.S.
MY
19:10:37  AMAZING TEAM AND THE WONDERFUL PARTNERSHIP, ESPECIALLY
19:10:41  THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF REHABILITATION, AND LOCAL EMPLOYERS WHO
19:10:44  HAVE SEEN THE BENEFITS OF  INCORPORATING DIVERSITY AND INCLUSIVITY
19:10:47 .
I THANK THEM ALL FOR THEIR SUPPORT AND LOVE.

19:10:50 I WANT TO RECOGNIZE AND SHOW CIVIC
19:10:53  PRIDE AND APPRECIATION TO TERESA COX,
19:10:57  THE FREMONT CITY COUNCIL AND MAYOR LILY MEI FOR YOUR EFFORTS TO
19:11:00  RECOGNIZE OUR HISPANIC COMMUNITY.
I AM HUMBLED
19:11:03  AND HONORED TO ACCEPT THIS PROCLAMATION ON BEHALF OF A
19:11:06  OUR RICH AND DIVERSE COMMUNITY.
THANK
19:11:08  YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU FOR  JOINING US THIS EVENING.

19:11:11 WE ARE SO FORTUNATE TO HAVE SUCH A DIVERSE
19:11:14  COMMUNITY WITH A STRONG LEGACY AND THE ABILITY TO CONTINUE
19:11:18  THAT, NOT JUST FOR THE IMMIGRANTS BUT FOR THE NEXT
19:11:21  GENERATION, AND SO WE'RE DELIGHTED TO CELEBRATE THAT AND ESPECIALLY FOR
19:11:24  YOUR OUTREACH TO HELP SO MANY OTHERS, I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT TO PASS
19:11:27  THAT  ON.
SO THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO
19:11:31  RECOGNIZE AND SHARE.
I KNOW THERE HAVE BEEN MANY EVENTS THROUGH
19:11:34 OUT THE COMMUNITY THIS LAST COUPLE WEEKS, THE
19:11:37  MARIACHI FESTIVALS AND OTHER LANGUAGE AND CULTURAL EXPERIENCES
19:11:40 , AND SO I KNOW THAT SEEING THAT IN THE LIBRARY AND OTHER AREAS, IT'S
19:11:43  BEEN  WONDERFUL.
SO THANK YOU AGAIN FOR JOINING US THIS EVENING.

19:11:48 AT THIS TIME, WE'RE GOING TO TURN TO ORAL COMMUNICATIONS.
AND
19:11:51  THOSE ARE ITEMS THAT ARE
19:11:55  NOT SCHEDULED ON THIS AGENDA THIS EVENING.

19:11:58 I BELIEVE WE HAD A COUPLE SPEAKERS WHO WERE INTERESTED IN ORAL COMMUNICATIONS.

19:12:01 ANY PERSON WISHING TO SPEAK ON ITEMS THAT ARE NOT SCHEDUL
19:12:04 ED ON THE
19:12:07  AGENDA MAY DO SO AT THIS TIME BY PRESSING THE RAISE HAND
19:12:10  ICON OR BY DIALING STAR NINE IF YOU'RE
19:12:14  CALLING IN.
SO
19:12:21  WE COULD START WITH THAT, THEN, SUSAN
19:12:24 ?
>> Ms. Gauthier: DO YOU WANT ME TO ANNOUNCE THE
19:12:27  SPEAKERS?
>> Mayor Mei: SURE.
>> Ms. Gauthier: THE FIRST PERSON 
19:12:30 WE'LL ALLOW TO SPEAK IS  KAR
19:12:33 ANVEER BAIN
19:12:35 S.
>> Mayor Mei: WELCOME.
>> HELLO.

19:12:38 HI, GUYS.

19:12:42 I'M THE FATHER OF TWO CHILDREN,
19:12:46  5 YEARS OLD AND 6 MONTHS OLD.
I'M HERE TO PROTECT THEM AND DEFEND
19:12:49  MY HOME FROM AN UNCONSTITUTIONAL INNOVATION
19:12:54   FROM -- WIRELESS.
THE FOLLOWING STATEMENTS ARE TRUE, ACCURATE AND WITHIN
19:12:57  MY PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE.
FAMILIES WITH YOUNG CHILDREN LIKE MINE ARE
19:13:00  VERY BUSY AROUND CHRISTMAS
19:13:04  HOLIDAYS FOR OBVIOUS REASONS.
THE
19:13:07  BIG WIRELESS COMPANIES USE THIS TIME TO RAM THROUGH LOCAL
19:13:10  LAWS THAT BENEFIT THEM
19:13:13  -- ON DECEMBER 17TH, 2019, THERE WAS A
19:13:17  FIRST READING ON CHANGES TO CITY OF FREMONT'S WIRELESS ORDINANCE AND
19:13:20  THEN ON JANUARY 14, 2020, THERE WAS A SECOND READING AND VOTE
19:13:24 .
THERE WAS ALSO A PRESENTATION BY WIRELESS INDUSTRY THAT
19:13:28  NIGHT WITHOUT EQUAL TIME GIVEN TO OPPONENTS
19:13:31  OF THIS EMINENT DOMAIN
19:13:35  DO DOMAIN-- TAKING OF PROPERTY.

19:13:38 IT WAS -- THROUGH THE SAME EVENING.

19:13:42 DID CITY OF FREMONT AND CITY COUNCILMEMBERS COMPLETE THOROUGH
19:13:45  DUE DILIGENCE AND DELIBERATION ON THESE MATTERS?
THE EVIDENCE
19:13:48  IN THE CITY COUNCIL VIDEO, AND
19:13:51  THE ANSWER IS NO.
FAST FORWARD TO TODAY AND I FIND THAT THERE IS SO CALL
19:13:54 ED SMALL WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS FACILITY,
19:13:57  BEING CONSTRUCTED 20 FEET
19:14:01  FROM MY HOME.
WITH THREE ERICKSON STREET
19:14:04  MACRO 670 ANTENNAS BEING INSTALLED ABOUT
19:14:07  20 FEET FROM -- OFF THE GROUND.
I'M HERE TO INFORM YOU THAT EVIDENCE IN THE
19:14:10  CITY OF  FREMONT'S PUBLIC -- SETS
19:14:14  THE STAGE OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENT CANNOT ALLOW ANY WIRELESS CORPORATION
19:14:17  TO POWER OFF ON THE WTF UNTIL WE HEAR BACK FROM THE
19:14:20  FCC REGARDING OUR ACTIVE COMPLAINT
19:14:24  AGAINST THEM.
THAT WOULD BE STRAIGHT FROM THE DIVISION
19:14:28  CHIEF OF COMPETITION AND INFRASTRUCTURE POLICY DIVISION
19:14:31  FCC WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS BUREAU AND --
19:14:34  SIMILAR -- CITING
19:14:37  RULE 1.1307 --
19:14:40  IN SONOMA, CALIFORNIA AND THOUSAND OAKS, CALIFORNIA HAVE
19:14:44  RESULTED IN THOSE TOWERS BEING NOT COMPLETED
19:14:48 .
THAT IS BECAUSE THE RULE I'M CITING
19:14:51  STATES THAT A NEPA ENVIRONMENTAL
19:14:54  ASSESSMENT IS REQUIRED FOR CELLULAR RADIO TELEPHONE SERVICE
19:14:57 S, NON-BUILDING MOUNTED ANTENNAS.
HEIGHT
19:15:00  ABOVE GROUND LEVEL THROUGH LOW
19:15:04 EST POINT OF ANTENNA IS 10 METERS AND THE TOTAL POWER OF
19:15:07  ALL IS GREATER THAN 1,000 VOLTS ERP.
THIS
19:15:10  ABLECATION FOR THIS  ANTENNA -- TECHNICAL
19:15:14  SPECS AND BECAUSE OF DAY
19:15:17  -- OFFICIALLY EXPRESSED IN THE SITE WAS AUGUST 9,
19:15:22  2019 AND MAY 3,
19:15:25  2021, THE WIRELESS APPLICANT VIOLATED FEDERAL LAW BY
19:15:28  NOT PROVIDING EVIDENCE FOR NEPA
19:15:31  REVIEW FOR WTF LET ALONE ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT
19:15:34  REQUIRED BY THIS  RULE.
SUCH NEGLIGENCE BY THE APPLICANT
19:15:38  MEANS -- 48,000 MEGAHERTZ IN THE
19:15:41  CITY OF FREMONT IS --
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:15:44 THE NEXT SPEAKER IS PAUL
19:15:47  G.

19:15:52 >> HI, I'M PAUL G
19:15:55 , FOUNDER OF ORGANIZATIONS DEDICATED TO PROVIDING LOCAL CONTROL
19:15:59  OVER THE PLACEMENT, CONSTRUCTION -- OF ANY SIZE
19:16:02  OR ANY G.
WE ADVOCATE FOR BROADBAND
19:16:06 , VIA FIBEROPTICS AND ONLY CALLS
19:16:08  AND TEXT PER FEDERAL LAW.
I'M HERE TO ASSIST THE RESIDENTS OF FREMONT.

19:16:12 I TEST AND AFFIRM THE FOLLOWING STATEMENTS ARE TRUE, ACCURATE AND WITHIN MY
19:16:15  PERSONAL  KNOWLEDGE.
I WORK ALONGSIDE FREMONT RESIDENTS THIS WEEKEND TO COMPLETE
19:16:18  RESEARCH ABOUT THE CITY OF FREMONT'S ACTIVITIES SINCE DECEMBER
19:16:23  2019 THAT UNNECESSARILY REVISED ITS WIRELESS ORDINANCE TO ALLOW
19:16:26  SO-CALLED SMALL  WIRELESS
19:16:30  TELECOMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES INTO RESIDENTIAL  AREAS USING A MINISTERIAL INSTEAD OF THE
19:16:33  FAR BETTER DISCRETIONARY APPROACH.
THIS RESEARCH CULMINATED
19:16:36  IN THE DETAILED OCTOBER 18TH EMAIL FROM
19:16:40  KAREN TO THE FREMONT CITY COUNCIL AND STAFF AND A FORMAL
19:16:43  COMPLAINT TO THE FCC FOR THAT  SO-CALLED
19:16:47  SWTF AT 38329 PRON SON STREET IN
19:16:50  FREMONT.
IN 2017, OUR TEAM OPPOSED SENATE
19:16:54  BILL S649, A WIRELESS INDUSTRY SPONSORED BILL THAT
19:16:57  WOULD HAVE CURTAILED LOCAL CONTROL OVER THE PLACEMENT
19:17:01  OF WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES.
WE DEFEATED THAT
19:17:04  BILL AND THIS YEAR WE DEFEATED A VERY SIMILAR INDUSTRY SPONSORED
19:17:07  BILL, SENATE BILL 556, THAT DESTROY
19:17:11  LOCAL CONTROL AND CHILD ENDANGERMENT WIRELESS BILL.

19:17:15 OUR TEAM WORKED FULL TIME FROM APRIL TO OCTOBER TO PRESERVE
19:17:17  LOCAL DROAL OVER THE PLACEMENT OF WIRELESS INFRASTRUCTURE AND WE WON AGAIN.

19:17:21 ON OCTOBER 4TH, GOVERNOR NEWSOM VEE
19:17:27  VETOED THE BILL SAYING THEY CONFLICT WITH AND COMPLICATE
19:17:30  FCC REQUIREMENTS SO IT WOULD BE IMPRUDENT TO
19:17:34  CODIFY THESE REQUIREMENTS INTO STATE LAW.
CONTINUING, THERE IS A ROLE FOR
19:17:37  LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN ADVANCING CALIFORNIA'S BROADBAND EFFORTS, PART OF OUR ACHIEVEMENT
19:17:40  LAID OUT IN THE BROAD BANT BUDGET BILL, ENABLES AND
19:17:43  ENCOURAGES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO TAKE AN ACTIVE ROLE IN THE LAST MILE OF BROADBAND
19:17:47  DEPLOYMENT.
THIS NEWS MEANS THAT THERE'S NOW AN IMMEDIATE NEED
19:17:50  TO UPDATE FREMONT'S CURRENT WIRELESS ORDINANCE
19:17:53  BECAUSE THE CURRENT ORDINANCE IS WHOLLY UNNECESSARY.

19:17:57 IT IS FAR TOO INDUSTRY-FRIENDLY AND DOES NOT STRIKE
19:18:00  A GOOD BALANCE BETWEEN GOLD PLATING THE PROFITS OF AN ALREADY
19:18:03  TRILLION DOLLAR WIRELESS INDUSTRY AT THE EXPENSE OF RESIDENTS
19:18:06 , CONSTITUENTS AND TAXPAYERS WHO FACE IMMINENT PUBLIC
19:18:09  SAFETY HARMS, UNCONSTITUTIONAL PRIVACY AND SURVEILLANCE HARMS AND UP
19:18:13  TO 20% LOSSES IN PROPERTY VALUES.
ALL DUE TO YOUR
19:18:16  CITY'S  ILL-CONSIDERED AND UNJUST  POLICIES.
NOW FOR EVEN
19:18:19  MORE GAME CHANGING NEWS.
AS YOU LEARNED BY EMAIL YESTERDAY,
19:18:22  THE NATION' WIRELESS BROADBAND AGENDA EAR REF
19:18:25 ICALLY CHANGED ON FRIDAY THE 13TH AND AUGUST
19:18:29  2021 DUE TO THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS RULING IN
19:18:33  CASE 21025 ENVIRONMENTAL
19:18:36  -- THE  JUDGES WROTE, WE GRANT PETITIONS IN PART AND
19:18:40  REMAND TO THE COMMISSION, THE COMMISSION FAILED TO PROVIDE A REASONABLE
19:18:43  EXPLANATION FOR ITS DETERMINATION THAT ITS GUIDELINES ADEQUATELY
19:18:47  PROTECT AGAINST THE HARMFUL EFFECTS OF EXPOSURE
19:18:50  TO RADIATION.
THIS DEMANDS A CHANGE.
I'VE EXPRESSED NO MATTER OF
19:18:53  LAW CONCERN BUT SOLELY MATTERS OF SUBSTANCE, FACT AND LAW.

19:18:58 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
NEXT SPEAKER IS REYE
19:19:01 S CAST.

19:19:06 >> HI.

19:19:47  OF STREETS IN FREMONT TO DELIVER ACTUAL PUBLIC SAFETY AND
19:19:51  TO PUT A STOP TO THE UNCONSTITUTIONAL
19:19:54  SURVEILLANCE THAT SO-CALLED SMALL WIRELESS
19:19:58  TELECOMMUNICATIONS FACILITY BRING TO RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOODS.
WE

YOU
19:20:11  HAVE A DUTY, YOU HAVE A DUTY TO ACT BASED ON THE
19:20:15  SUBSTANTIAL WRITTEN EVIDENCE WE ARE PLACING IN YOUR
19:20:18  PUBLIC RECORD TONIGHT.
YOU CANNOT, NO LONGER,
19:20:21  HIDE BEHIND THE DEBUNKED UNSCIENTIFIC
19:20:25  FCC RF MICROWAVE RADIATION
19:20:28  REGULATION.
11,000 PAGES OF PEER REVIEWED
19:20:31  SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE OF HARMS FROM
19:20:34  RF MICROWAVE RADIATION AT LEVELS FAR BELOW THAT ALLOWED
19:20:38  BY THE FCC RF REGULATION
19:20:41  WERE COMPILED BY THE CHILDREN'S HEALTH DEFENSE FOR THEIR  AUGUST 13TH,
19:20:45  2021 LANDMARK VICTORY AGAINST THE FCC, THE COURT
19:20:48  ORDERED THE FCC TO READ THIS EVIDENCE AND CONSIDER IT WHEN MAKING POLICY
19:20:51 IES.
WE ARE PLACING THIS TIME 11,000
19:20:54  PAGES OF EVIDENCE INTO THE CITY OF FREMONT PUBLIC
19:20:57  RECORD.
CITY COUNCILMEMBERS, YOU ARE
19:21:01  WITHOUT SUFFICIENT LOCAL REGULATION
19:21:04  MUST NOW BE ADDRESSED AND CHANGE YOUR LOCAL
19:21:08  LAWS ARE NOT CONSISTENT WITH FEDERAL STATUTES INCLUDING BUT NOT
19:21:11  LIMITED TO THE 96 TELECOMMUNICATIONS ACT,
19:21:14  THE NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY ACT,
19:21:17  AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT AND FAIR HOUSING AMENDMENTS.
OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENT IS
19:21:20  BOUND TO FOLLOW THE READING OF THE FEDERAL TELECOM LAWS

19:21:40  HAVE NOT YET BEEN TESTED IN CASE BY CASE
19:21:44  ADJUDICATION AS ADMITTED BY THE FCC ATTORNEYS THEMSELVES IN FEBRUARY

ORAL ARGUMENTS AND U.S. COURT OF APPEALS
19:21:51  CASE LOCAL GOVERNMENT  FCC REGARDING THE

WHEN YOU SEE THE WIRELESS INDUSTRY'S RESPONSE TO
19:21:58  THAT, THE SECURED RULING IN AUGUST 2021 RULING AND
19:22:01  ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH TRUST, THINGS WILL HAVE TO CHANGE IN FREMONT
19:22:05 , THEY HAVE TO CHANGE IN FREMONT.
I HAVE
19:22:08  EXPRESSED NO MATTER OF CONCERN
19:22:11  BUT SOLELY MATTERS OF SUBSTANCE, FACT, LAW.

19:22:14 PLEASE, THIS IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN TO MY TOWN
19:22:18  AND MY  FREMONT.
WE HAVE TO STOP IT TODAY.

19:22:22 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
THE NEXT SPEAKER IS SRIVI
19:22:25 DYA  PRAKASH.

19:22:32 >> GOOD EVENING, HONORABLE  MAYOR, COUNCILMEMBERS AND MEMBERS
19:22:35  OF THE PUBLIC.
I'M A
19:22:38  RESIDENT OF FREMONT SINCE 2005.
TODAY
19:22:41  I STAND HERE AS AN ADVOCATE FOR VICTIMS AND SURVIVORS
19:22:45  OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND THANK YOU FOR ADOPTING THE
19:22:48  PROCLAMATION TO COMMEMORATE OCTOBER AS
19:22:51  DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AWARENESS MONTH.
I
19:22:54  REPRESENT AN ORGANIZATION DEVOTED TO
19:22:58  SERVING VICTIMS AND SURVIVORS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND WOULD LIKE
19:23:01  TO TAKE A FEW MOMENTS TO TALK ABOUT AN EPIDEMIC THAT IS
19:23:04  PERVASIVE IN OUR HOMES, CITIES, STATE, COUNTRY, AND ALL
19:23:07  OVER THE WORLD.
DMES
19:23:11 DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS AN ILL THAT EXISTS IN ALL COMMUNITIES
19:23:15 , IRRESPECTIVE OF CULTURE,
19:23:18  SEXUAL ORIENTATION, FINANCIAL STATUS OR IMMIGRATION REALITIES.
THE
19:23:21  YEAR 2020 HAS SEEN A PANDEMIC
19:23:24 , RAGING FIRES AND ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY, AND WHILE
19:23:28  THESE EX-TREAN JUST CIRCUMSTANCES HAVE CERTAINLY
19:23:31  TURNED MANY LIVES UPSIDE-DOWN, THEIR IMPACT IS MAGNIFIED ON
19:23:34  THE MOST VULNERABLE:  THE VICTIMS
19:23:38  AND SURVIVORS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE.
INCREASED
19:23:41  REQUESTS FOR INTERVENTION AND LEGAL REMEDIES OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS HAVE
19:23:44  SHED LIGHT ON THE ONGOING NEED FOR RESOURCES
19:23:48 .
LAST YEAR, IN A SINGLE DAY  ALONE,
19:23:52  77,000 INDIVIDUALS  REACHED OUT FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE RELATED
19:23:56  HELP.
IN CALIFORNIA, THAT NUMBER IS AS
19:23:59  HIGH AS 6,000 PEOPLE A DAY.

19:24:02 PREVENTION FOCUSED ACTIVITIES ARE THE CRITICAL NEED OF THE HOUR
19:24:05 .
AND STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES
19:24:09 , COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, WE ALL HAVE
19:24:12  OUR PARTS TO PLAY.
WE THANK THE CITY OF
19:24:15  FREMONT FOR PROVIDING MUCH NEEDED ASSISTANCE IN MANY AREA
19:24:18 S, AS WELL AS REQUEST TO STEP UP
19:24:21  EFFORTS.
MY THREE REQUESTS
19:24:25  OF CITY COUNCIL TO CONSIDER THE  FOLLOWING:  ONE, ENACT
19:24:28  AND SUPPORT POLICIES THAT ADDRESS INTERSECTIONAL
19:24:31  APPROACHES TO ADDRESS DOMESTIC VIOLENCE.
TO NAME
19:24:34  A FEW, HOMELESSNESS, BAY
19:24:38  PAY EQUITY AND -- REDUCTION
19:24:42 .
TO PROVIDE FUNDING FOR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE
19:24:47  -- PROVIDERS, THREE, RE-THINK LAW ENFORCEMENT RESPONSES
19:24:50  TO CRISIS SITUATIONS, WITH SPECIAL FOCUS ON STOPPING BRUTALITY
19:24:54  AGAINST PEOPLE OF COLOR.

19:24:57 FOUR, OFFER TRAINING ON CULTURAL RESPONSIVENESS FOR VARIOUS
19:25:00  LOCAL GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES AND  AGENCIES, AND IMPROVE LANGUAGE
19:25:04  ACCESS.
FIVE, INVOLVE
19:25:07  KNOWN GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS AS THOUGHT  PARTNERS, WHILE
19:25:10  PLANNING CITY ACTIVITIES.
SIX, UPLIFT
19:25:13  THE VOICES OF THE MINORITY GROUPS WHENEVER POSSIBLE,
19:25:16  AS THEY OFTEN LACK REPRESENTATION.
AND FINALLY, TO
19:25:20  OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS, WE URGE YOU TO RECOGNIZE
19:25:23  DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AS A PRESSING ISSUE
19:25:26 .
EXEMPLIFY HEALTHY RELATIONSHIP
19:25:29 S FOR THE CHILDREN AT HOME AND ELECT LEADERS AND POLICIES THAT
19:25:32  CONTRIBUTE TO WHAT'S BUILDING A
19:25:36  A --
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU
19:25:39 .
NEXT SPEAKER IS
19:25:43  STEPHANIE SZTO.

19:25:51 >> HI, GOOD EVENING, EVERYONE.
I LIVE IN THIS CITY FOR ABOUT 15 YEARS.

19:25:54 THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME FOR ME TO SPEAK TONIGHT.
AND
19:25:58  I AFFIRM THAT THE FOLLOWING STATEMENTS ARE TRUE
19:26:01  AND ACCURATE WITHIN MY PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE AND WILL CONTINUE MY
19:26:04  TESTIMONY FROM THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER.
THE D.C. 
19:26:07  CIRCUIT JUDGE STATED ON AUGUST 13TH, TWEP
19:26:12  2021 THAT FCC HAD
19:26:15  IGNORED 11 PAGES OF PEER REVIEW SCIENTIFIC
19:26:18  LITERATURE THAT CONCLUDES
19:26:21  -- ADVERSE BIOLOGICAL
19:26:25  EFFECT FROM RADIATION INCLUDING DAMAGE TO BRAIN, HEART,
19:26:28  MEMORY AND FERTILITY, WITH CHILDREN BEING EVEN MORE VULNERABLE
19:26:31  THAN ADULTS IN
19:26:35  AN EXTRAORDINARY -- THE COURT ORDERED
19:26:38  THE FCC TO, QUOTE, ADDRESS THE IMPACT OF MICROWAVE
19:26:41  RADIATION ON CHILDREN, THE HEALTH IMPLICATION OF LONG TERM
19:26:45  EXPOSURE TO RF MICROWAVE RADIATION, AND
19:26:49  WHILE
19:26:52  -- THAT HAS OCCURRED SINCE THE COMMISSION ADOPTED
19:26:55  AN EXISTING MICROWAVE RADIATION GUIDELINE
19:26:59  FROM THE INDUSTRY IN 1996.
UNQUOTE.

19:27:02 THIS COURT RULING ALSO HIGHLIGHTED
19:27:05  THAT U.S. AGENCY HAVE NOT REVEALED
19:27:09  THE RESEARCH ON REVERSE IMPACT OF RF MICROWAVE
19:27:12  RADIATION TO -- THIS IS
19:27:15  STRONG EVIDENCE OF HARM FROM LONG TERM EXPOSURE
19:27:18  OF WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATION FACILITIES.
CHILDREN
19:27:22  HAVE UNIQUE VULNERABILITY
19:27:25 .
THE SIGNS ESTABLISH
19:27:28  ADVERSE NEGATIVE HEALTH EFFECT FROM R
19:27:32 F MICROWAVE RADIATION POLLUTE AT LEVEL THAT HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS
19:27:36  OF TIME LOWER THAN THE CURRENT  FCC RF MICROWAVE
19:27:40  RADIATION EXPOSURE REGULATION.
IN SHORT,
19:27:43  THE CITY OF FREMONT AND THE CITY ATTORNEY CAN NO LONGER RELY
19:27:46  ON THE FCC MICROWAVE RADIATION REGULATION
19:27:49  TO DELIVER ACTUAL
19:27:53  PUBLIC SAFETY.
THIS IS NO LONGER BUSINESS AS USUAL
19:27:56 .
URGENT CHANGES ARE NEEDED IN
19:27:59  FREMONT, CITY OF FREMONT'S
19:28:02  JOB IS TO PROVIDE ACTUAL PUBLIC SAFETY
19:28:05 .
THE DECEMBER
19:28:09  2019 FCC ORDER
19:28:12   19-126,
19:28:15  ALSO
19:28:19  REMANNED BACK TO THE FCC -- OKAY.
SO ALL OF
19:28:22  THOSE VERIZON
19:28:25  PERMIT YOUR CITY RECENTLY ISSUED OF ERICKSON
19:28:29  67 -- ANTENNA, ANTENNA
19:28:32  THAT OUTPUT 28,000-MEGAHERTZ OF R
19:28:36 F MICROWAVE HAVE NO FCC RF
19:28:39  MICROWAVE RADIATION REG REG LAITION.
BECAUSE THE
19:28:42  FCC AS THEY ARE REGULATION ONLY COVER FREQUENCY
19:28:46  UP TO 6,000-MEGAHERTZ.

19:28:49 YOUR CITY CANNOT ALLOW THE OPERATION OF THIS
19:28:53  ANTENNA IN FREMONT UNTIL
19:28:56  THE FCC --
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:29:05 THE NEXT SPEAKER IS CHRIS.

19:29:08 >> SO I THINK IT'S BEEN YEARS SINCE THE CITY
19:29:12  SAID THEY WOULD ADDRESS THE PARKING
19:29:15  ISSUE ON AUBREY STREET
19:29:18 .
I WENT THERE TODAY TO A  BUSINESS,
19:29:21  AND NOTHING HAS  CHANGED.

19:29:24 YOU GUYS SAID THAT THE
19:29:27  ISSUE WAS THAT THE TWO PEOPLE YOU HIRED IN THE POLICE DEPARTMENT
19:29:31  HADN'T BEEN TRAINED YET, BUT I BELIEVE IT'S
19:29:34  SIX OR NINE MONTHS AGO WHERE YOU SAID THOSE PEOPLE HAD BEEN TRAINED AND THEY
19:29:37  WOULD START ACTUALLY
19:29:40  ENFORCING THE  LAWS.
ALONG AUBREY STREET, I
19:29:43  WAS ABLE TO FIND NO CAR THAT WAS TICKETED IN ABOUT
19:29:46  A HALF A MILE OF ACTUALLY
19:29:51  FOUR--TENTHS OF A MILE OF CARS THAT ARE
19:29:55  JUST PARKED AND
19:29:58  THEY'RE JUST ALMOST ABANDONED.
IN THAT YOU DO HAVE
19:30:01  RVs AND SUCH, BUT THE
19:30:04  FREMONT CITY COUNCIL SAID THEY WOULD ADDRESS THIS BY HIRE
19:30:07 ING TWO MORE POLICE OFFICERS, WHICH THEY DID
19:30:11 .
BUT WHEN I WENT THERE TODAY,
19:30:14  THERE'S PEOPLE WANTING TO SELL FIREWOOD OFF THE SIDE OF THE STREET.

19:30:20 I LOOK AT BING
19:30:23  AND I LOOK AT THE STREET VIEW FROM 2014.
THERE'S ALMOST NOT
19:30:26  A SINGLE CAR PARKED THERE.
YOU GUYS
19:30:29  HAVE DONE NOTHING TO ADDRESS THIS.
YOU'VE ADDED TO
19:30:33  THE BUDGET TO ADDRESS IT.
AND
19:30:36  THEN YOU STILL DO NOT ADDRESS THE PROBLEM
19:30:39 .
I DON'T
19:30:43  UNDERSTAND HOW IT NEEDS TO BE EXPLAINED.
I'VE TALKED TO
19:30:46  PEOPLE AND BUSINESSES THERE, AND
19:30:49  THEY SAY THEY KEEP CALLING IN THE SAME THING, BUT THE CITY DOES  NOTHING.

19:30:54 SO IF YOU GUYS WANT TO SAY THAT YOU'RE
19:30:57  GOING TO ENFORCE CITY  LAWS SUCH AS PARKING
19:31:01  FOR 72 HOURS, ENFORCE THEM.
OTHERWISE,
19:31:04  YOU NEED TO TAKE THEM OFF THE BOOKS AND SAY,
19:31:07  THIS IS A CITY THAT WILL NOT ENFORCE ALL THESE LAWS.

19:31:10 YOU HAVE SO MANY LAWS THAT YOU'VE PUT
19:31:13  ON THE BOOKS AS A CITY LAW THAT YOU REFUSE TO
19:31:17  ENFORCE.
HOW MANY -- I
19:31:21  MEAN, IF
19:31:24  THE POLICE OFFICERS WON'T ENFORCE IT AND THE
19:31:27  CITY CODE ENFORCEMENT OFFICER WON'T ENFORCE IT, I MEAN
19:31:30  MEAN, WHY IS IT STILL ON THE BOOKS?
TAKE IT OFF
19:31:33  THE BOOKS OR ENFORCE THE LAW.

19:31:37 I UNDERSTAND, YOU NEED TO HAVE COMPASSIONATE WAYS TO DEAL WITH THESE
19:31:41  THINGS.
BUT YOU GUYS REFUSE TO USE THE
19:31:44  RESOURCES YOU HAVE TO
19:31:47  DO COMPASSIONATE THINGS.
AUTOMALL,
19:31:51  THERE'S STILL THAT PROPERTY YOU WISH TO BUILD A SPORTS COMPLEX THAT
19:31:54  YOU COULD USE TO ADDRESS THESE RV PARKING ISSUE
19:31:57 S, BUT YOU CONTINUE TO PRETEND THAT IT DOESN'T EXIST.

19:32:00 AND I HAVE FIVE SECONDS LEFT.

19:32:13 >> Mayor Mei: OKAY, THANK YOU.
NEXT SPEAKER IS N
19:32:16 BAINS.
WELCOME.

19:32:20 >> I BELIEVE T.J. WAS GOING TO GO
19:32:23  BEFORE ME.
IS THAT POSSIBLE TO HAVE HIM GO BEFORE
19:32:26  ME?
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY.

19:32:32 I'M LOOKING FOR THAT.

19:32:36 TJ, IF YOU WOULD GO FIRST AND THEN FOLLOWED BY NB
19:32:39 AINS.

19:32:46 WELCOME.

19:32:54 >> THIS IS TJ.
AM I ON?
>> Mayor Mei: YES
19:32:57 .
>> GOOD EVENING, MADAME MAYOR AND THE HONORABLE
19:33:01  CITY COUNCILMEMBERS.
THANK YOU.
MY
19:33:04  NAME IS TJ AND I HAVE LIVED IN FREMONT FOR
19:33:07  A LONG TIME.
I ATTEST AND I A FIRM THAT THE FOLLOWING STATEMENTS ARE TRUE
19:33:10 , ACCURATE AND WITHIN MY PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE.
THE CITY OF
19:33:14  FREMONT IS UNWITTINGLY ASSUMING MASSIVE
19:33:17  FINANCIAL LIABILITY WITH ITS  ILL-CONSIDERED SMALL CELL
19:33:21   POLICIES BECAUSE THE CITY STAFF AND COUNCILMEMBERS WERE PLAY
19:33:24 ED BY THE WIRELESS INDUSTRY.
THE CITY
19:33:27  WAS QUICK INTO ON BIG WIRELESS LIABILITIES WHEN
19:33:30  THE CITY DECIDED TO RENT THE  PUBLIC'S LIGHT POLES
19:33:33  TO BE USED AS CELL TOWERS.
19:33:37 , WITHOUT COMPLETING SUFFICIENT DUE DILIGENCE OR PASSING SUFFICIENT
19:33:40  LOCAL REGULATIONS.
YOUR HANDS WERE
19:33:44  NEVER TIED.
THAT WAS JUST ANOTHER LIE FROM THE
19:33:47  BILL -- I'M ENTERING INTO THE
19:33:50  PUBLIC RECORD THIS EVENING A 2017 LETTER, A LEGAL ANALYSIS
19:33:54  FROM
19:33:57  AN INVENTORY TO THE CALIFORNIA ASSEMBLY
19:34:01  APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE.
THE
19:34:05 THE LETTER DESCRIBES THE
19:34:08  DOCTRINE OF FIXTURES AND THIS ANALYSIS WAS
19:34:11  ONE THAT MOVED THE VOTES IN
19:34:16  BOTH THE STATEHOUSES AND SHUT DOWN SENATE BILL
19:34:20  SB -- THE BILL RETURNED BY
19:34:23  GOVERNOR BROWN IN 2017.
I WILL EMAIL THIS
19:34:27  LINK OF THIS TO THE CITY.

19:34:32 WITH ALL THE SHE NAN
19:34:39  -- IT IS NO SURPRISE THAT THE LARGEST
19:34:42  RE-INSURERS IN THE WORLD  INCLUDES LLOYD'S OF
19:34:45  LONDON, AM BEST OVER A DECADE AGO EVALUATED
19:34:49  THE INDEPENDENT SIGN
19:34:52 S, FROM THE WIRE
19:34:56 LESS FREQUENCY MICRORADIATION AND SPECIFICALLY EXCLUDED
19:35:00  ALL CLAIMS OF INJURY, ILLNESS OR DEATH FROM
19:35:03  MICRORADIATION FROM ANY GENERAL LIABILITY INSURANCE POLICIES.

19:35:07 THEY DO NOT WANT ANOTHER -- ON THEIR HANDS
19:35:10 .
THE WIRELESS INDUSTRY IS BUSY TRANSFER
19:35:14 RING THESE LIABILITIES TO THE CITY OF FREMONT.
HOW DOES BIG
19:35:17  WIRELESS PLAY THIS CHESS GAME?
BIG WIRE
19:35:20 LESS HIRES A THIRD PARTY AGENT TO
19:35:24  BUILD CELL TOWERS.
THEY FALSELY CLAIM
19:35:28  -- EQUALS SAFETY WHEN IT DOES NOT.
BIG WIRE
19:35:32 LESS DEPENDS ON  OVERWORKED CITY STAFFERS NOT TO
19:35:35  CATCH THE NUANCES OF THESE
19:35:38  MOVES BUT WIRELESS FILES INCOMPLETE APPLICATIONS
19:35:41  AND LIES WAY TO THE BACK DAY AFTER DAY,
19:35:44  MAKING IT EVEN HARDER.

19:35:47 CITY COUNCIL'S ABILITY TO
19:35:51   COME -- ALL THESE FACTS GIVE THE CITY COUNCIL
19:35:54  THE ABILITY TO CANCEL ALL --
19:35:59 
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
NEXT SPEAKER IS NBAINS.

19:36:03 >> ACTUALLY I APOLOGIZE FOR  THIS, BUT IS THOMAS THERE?

19:36:07 I BELIEVE HE WANTED TO GO AHEAD OF ME AS WELL.

19:36:10 >> Mayor Mei: I APOLOGIZE, WE CAN'T JUST RANDOMLY
19:36:14  -- I THINK THAT IT WOULD HELP US -- BECAUSE WE HAVE SO MANY
19:36:17  DIFFERENT SPEAKERS, I DON'T KNOW WHICH IS WHICH ORDER, BUT THIS IS
19:36:20  HARD FOR US TO THEN MANAGE IF WE'RE GOING TO BE MOVING SPEAKERS BACK AND
19:36:24  FORTH.
SO THOMAS WILL
19:36:27  BE THE LAST ONE AND THEN YOU NEED TO SPEAK OR ELSE -- BECAUSE OTHERWISE
19:36:31  WE HAVE OTHER SPEAKERS AND WE DON'T KNOW WHICH ORDER SO IT MAKES
19:36:34  IT DIFFICULT FOR US.

19:36:39 THOMAS, FOLLOWED BY NBAIN
19:36:42 S.
>> THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR.
MY NAME IS THOMAS FOLEY.

19:36:45 I'M ON THE HOA BOARD HERE IN THE PARKMONT COMMUNITY, AND
19:36:48  I RUN A LOCAL BIKE CLUB, ONE OF THE MOST
19:36:51  POPULAR BIKE CLUBS HERE IN FREMONT AND THEN
19:36:58  A TECH COMPANY AS WELL.
ANYHOW, ONE OF MY RECENT NEIGHBORS BROUGHT A CONCERN
19:37:01  TO ME WHICH ACTUALLY BROUGHT ME HERE,
19:37:04  I GENERALLY WANT TO AVOID THESE THINGS, THEY'RE UNPLEASANT IN MY
19:37:07  OPINION, AND SO I WANT TO COVER A
19:37:10  COUPLE OF THINGS.
FIRST OFF I WANT TO ATTEST THAT THE FOLLOWING STATEMENTS
19:37:13  THAT I'M ABOUT TO MAKE, I KNOW ARE TRUE.
I'VE RESEARCHED THEM
19:37:17  AND THEY'RE WITHIN MY PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE OF RESEARCH THAT
19:37:20  I'VE DONE.
SO THREE THINGS, FIRST IS THE
19:37:24  96 TELECOMMUNICATIONS ACT, SECOND IS THE 2005
19:37:28  2009 CIRCUIT RULING AND THE THIRD IS THE APRIL 19TH SUPREME COURT RULING OF
19:37:32  T-MOBILE VERSUS SAN FRANCISCO WHICH ARE ALL PERTINENT
19:37:35  TO THE CELL TOWER GOING UP IN THE PARKMONT
19:37:38  COMMUNITY.
SO LET'S TOUCH ON THE FIRST ONE, THE
19:37:42  THE
19:37:46  332A7, WHICH STATES IN PARAGRAPH A, GENERAL
19:37:49  AUTHORITY, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN THIS PARAGRAPH, NOTHING IN
19:37:52  THIS ACT SHALL LIMIT OR AFFECT THE AUTHORITY OF THE STATE OR
19:37:56  LOCAL GOVERNMENT REGARDING THE
19:38:00  PERSONAL WIRELESS SERVICE FACILITIES.
SO HERE WE SEE THAT A WAS
19:38:03   FOLLOWED BY A FEW NARROW PRE-EMPTIONS OF LOCAL AUTHORITY
19:38:06  IN PARAGRAPH B FOR THE PURPOSE OF ESTABLISH
19:38:09 ING TELECOMMUNICATIONS IN
19:38:12  21 IS ONLY MAKING WIRELESS PHONE CALLS
19:38:15 .
THAT'S A FULL STOP.
IT DOES NOT INCLUDE WIRELESS
19:38:19  BROADBAND DATA CAPACITY OR OTHER
19:38:24  INDUSTRY TERMS.
WHEN THINKING ABOUT THIS, WE KNOW
19:38:27  THAT YOU'RE BOUND BY THE 9TH CIRCUIT COURT AND
19:38:30  THE U.S. SUPREME COURT.
NOT BY RULINGS IN ANY OTHER CIRCUIT.

19:38:37  -- CLEARLY DEFINE BOTH SIGNIFICANT GAP IN COVERAGE AND LEAST
19:38:40  INTRUSIVE MEANS TO FILL SAID GAP IN TERMS OF THE ABILITY TO MAKE OUT
19:38:43 DOOR WIRELESS PHONE CALLS IN MOST PLACES.
NOT EVERY PLACE
19:38:47  CONCEIVABLE.
SO THERE'S NO MENTION OF  IN-BUILDING COVERAGE
19:38:50 , CAPACITY OF WIRELESS BROADBAND IN ANY FEDERAL
19:38:53  PRE-EMPTION LAWS AND COURT RULINGS.
THE LAW IS CLEAR
19:38:57 .
ONCE THERE'S THE ABILITY TO
19:39:00  MAKE PHONE CALLS, THE PRE-EMPTION ENDS.
THAT DESCRIBES
19:39:04  FREMONT TODAY.
 -- STATES THE CITY HAS
19:39:07  LOCAL POLICE POWER TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE USE
19:39:10  USES OF LAND WITHIN ITS JURISDICTION.
THE WORD
19:39:13  IN COMMODE MEANS TO GIVE IN CONVENIENCE OR TO GIVE TRESS
19:39:16  TO, TROUBLE TO, IN THE QUIET ENJOYMENT OF SOMETHING
19:39:20 .
ALL THESE IMPACTS
19:39:23  COULD DISTURB PUBLIC ROAD NOISE --
19:39:27  ITS QUIET ENJOYMENT.
SO CITY COUNCILMEMBERS, NOISE
19:39:30  NOISE IS MUCH BROADER THAN JUST AUDIBLE
19:39:33  NOISE.
POST MODULATED MICROWAVE RADIATION
19:39:38 , IN THE END I THINK YOU HAVE THE DUTY TO PROTECT THE QUIET ENJOYMENT
19:39:41  OF FREMONT NEIGHBORS.

19:39:46 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
THE NEXT SPEAKER IS
19:39:51  NBAINS.
>> THANK YOU.
GOOD EVENING, EVERYONE.

19:39:58 WHO SPOKE EARLIER IS MY BROTHER AND THE TWO LITTLE ONES HE MENTIONED WERE MY
19:40:01  NIECE AND NEPHEW WHO MEAN THE WORLD TO ME.
I'M IN MY EARLY
19:40:04  30s JUST LIKE A WOMAN LIVING IN A HOUSE IN SACRAMENTO THAT HAD A SO-CALL
19:40:07 ED SMALL CELL OPERATING IN FRONT HER FAMILY'S HOME
19:40:10  FROM  MARCH 2019 THROUGH AUGUST 13,
19:40:15  2021.
KEY PHRASES HERE THAT I WANT TO YOU REMEMBER ARE
19:40:18 , HAD OPERATED AND THE DATE AUGUST 13, TWEP
19:40:22  2021, THE TAI OF THE D.C.  CIRCUIT RULING
19:40:26  THAT EAR REFER BLI  CHANGED THE WIRELESS WORLD.
I
19:40:29  WANT TO SHARE A REAL LIFE STORY OF A
19:40:32  COUPLE LITTLE RED RIDING WOLF
19:40:36  HOODS AND THE BIG BAD WOLF.
IN WINTER
19:40:39  2019, THE 3-YEAR-OLD AND 6-YEAR-OLD LITTLE GIRLS
19:40:42  SLEEPING IN THE BEDROOM ABOVE THE
19:40:46  GARAGE GOT SICK WITH MICROWAVE RADIATION ILLNESSES WITHIN A
19:40:50  FEW WEEKS AS DIAGNOSED BY A MEDICAL DOCTOR.

19:40:53 YOU REMEMBER THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT APRIL 4, 2019 RULE
19:40:56  RULING IN THE T-MOBILE V. SAN FRANCISCO, THE
19:40:59  JUDGES WROTE, AND I QUOTE, USES
19:41:02  MAY BE -- BEYOND OBSTRUCTION OF TRAVEL.
FOR EXAMPLE, WIRE
19:41:05 LESS EQUIPMENT MIGHT CAUSE NEGATIVE HEALTH CONSEQUENCES
19:41:09 , SUCH IMPACTS COULD DISTURB THE QUIET ENJOYMENT OF
19:41:13  STREETS.
END QUOTE.
THE STREETS DOESN'T JUST MEAN
19:41:16  THE PAVEMENT AND THE SIDEWALK.
IT CERTAINLY
19:41:19  MEANS THE QUIET ENJOYMENT OF ONE'S OWN FRONT YARD AND BEDROOM, WHERE
19:41:22  THE LITTLE GIRLS TRIED TO SLEEP.
OUR TWO LITTLE RED RIDING
19:41:25  HOODS THROUGH NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN WENT IN THEIR BEDROOM, COULD
19:41:29  NOT SLEEP, SUFFERED MIGRAINE HEADACHES, DEVELOPED UNEXPLAINED
19:41:32  FLU SYMPTOMS, STRANGE TWITCHES AND EVEN STARTED DEPRESSION
19:41:36 .
OUT OF THEIR BEDROOM, THE FAMILY HAD
19:41:39  TO SPEND $15,000 TO SHIELD THEIR OWN HOME.
THE
19:41:42  FAMILY COMPLETELY LOST THE USE OF THEIR FRONT YARD.
THIS IS AN
19:41:45  UNJUST AND UNNECESSARY TAKING OF PROPERTY.
NEGATIVE
19:41:48  HEALTH CONSEQUENCES WERE DOCUMENTED AT THIS HOME,
19:41:52  NEGATIVE HEALTH CONSEQUENCES.
YOU NEED TO REMEMBER THAT
19:41:55 .
FROM RF MICROWAVE RADIATION POLLUTION
19:41:58  FROM INFRASTRUCTURE ANTENNAS ARE SOLIDLY ON THE TABLE
19:42:01  FOR CITIES TO CONSIDER IN THEIR WIRELESS
19:42:05  CITING POLICIES, PER CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT.
PROFESSIONAL RF MEASUREMENTS
19:42:08  OF THE SMALL CELL SHOWS THAT THE AVERAGE RF MICROWAVE
19:42:11  RADIATION IN THE BEDROOM WAS METERED AT
19:42:14  30 MILLION TIMES HIGHER THAN THE 5 BARS TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICE
19:42:17 .
THE FACT THAT THIS EXCESSIVE LEVEL OF MICROWAVE
19:42:21  RADIATION IS COMPLIANT WITH FCC R
19:42:24 F REGULATIONS PROVES THAT THESE REGULATIONS REQUIRE FURTHER RESEARCH
19:42:27  AND REVISION.
THE RF MEASUREMENT DATA AND MEDICAL
19:42:30  DATA FROM THIS SACRAMENTO HOME WERE PLACED ON THE
19:42:33  FCC'S RECORD IN THE CHD LAWSUIT WHICH RECEIVED
19:42:36 DITY RULING ON AUGUST 13TH,
19:42:39  2021, THE DAY THE FAMILY LEARNED THAT THE BIG RED
19:42:43  POWERED OFF ITS BIG BAD WOLF.
THE
19:42:46  WOLF HAS REMAINED OFF THROUGH TODAY.
THIS IS FULL RECOGNITION
19:42:50  OF BIG RED THAT THERE ARE BIG PROBLEMS,
19:42:53  THIS DATA IS NOW IN THE CITY OF FREMONT'S PUBLIC RECORD AS WELL
19:42:56 .
WE INVITE THE CITY --
19:42:59 
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
THE NEXT SPEAKER IS T
19:43:02 HEODORA
19:43:05   SCARATO.
WELCOME.
>> THANK YOU SO
19:43:09  MUCH.
I'M EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR WITH ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH TRUST,
19:43:12  WE'RE A SCIENTIFIC THINK TANK AND ACTUALLY WE ARE
19:43:15  ONE OF THE ORGANIZATIONS ON THE CASE IN THE D.C. 
19:43:19  CIRCUIT FROM AUGUST 13TH.
SO I'M CALL
19:43:22 ING IN JUST TO REALLY REITERATE
19:43:25  WHAT'S BEEN SAID, BUT I WANTED TO POINT SOMETHING OUT.

19:43:28 SO THE COURT SPECIFICALLY RULED
19:43:32  THAT THE FCC NEEDED TO ADDRESS ISSUES
19:43:35  OF LONG TERM EXPOSURE
19:43:39  AND ALSO IMPACTS TO CHILDREN AS WELL AS ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS
19:43:42  AND NON-CANCER EFFECTS, DAMAGE TO THE BRAIN,
19:43:45  AS WELL AS DAMAGE TO SPERM AND REPRODUCTION, WHICH HAVE
19:43:49  BEEN DONE IN THE PEER REVIEWED RESEARCH.
BUT MOST PEOPLE JUST ASSUME
19:43:52   THAT, OF COURSE, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT HEALTH AND
19:43:55  SAFETY AGENCIES THAT WE WOULD JUST DEPEND ON AND
19:43:59  ASSUME THAT THEY'RE LOOKING INTO THIS ISSUE
19:44:02 , THAT THEY HAVE REVIEWED ALL THE SCIENCE BUT THEY HAVEN'T.

19:44:05 THERE'S BEEN NO REVIEW OF ALL OF THE SCIENCE OF ROBUST
19:44:08  REVIEW TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPLICATIONS FOR HUMAN HEALTH AND
19:44:12  THERE IS ADEQUATE, I MEAN, COPIOUS,
19:44:15  THOUSANDS OF PAGES OF DOCUMENTATION OF HARM ON THE RECORD
19:44:19 .
AND AS HAS BEEN POINTED OUT, CHILDREN ARE MORE VULNERABLE
19:44:22 .
THEY HAVE
19:44:27  -- SKULLS, THEY'RE MORAL ELECTRICALLY CONDUCTED,
19:44:30  THE RADIATION PENETRATES DEEPER INTO THEIR BRAIN COMPARED TO ADULTS
19:44:33 , AND OF COURSE THEY'RE GOING TO LIVE LONGER WITH MORE EXPOSURE
19:44:37  OVER THEIR LIFETIME, AND THEIR DEVELOPING BRAINS ARE
19:44:41  MORE VULNERABLE, MORE SENSITIVE TO INSULTS FROM
19:44:46  ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES AND ESPECIALLY FOR THIS WHICH
19:44:49  RADIO FREQUENCY RADIATION WHICH IS AN ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTANT
19:44:52 .
SO IF YOU CAN IMAGINE, WOULD
19:44:56  YOU DRIVE AT A CAR AND LET YOUR
19:44:59  KIDS GO INTO A CAR WHERE THE SAFETY
19:45:03  SAFETY -- THE SEAT BELTS, THEY WOULDN'T EVEN BE SEAT BELTS, BUT ALL
19:45:06  THE SAFETY FEATURES HAVEN'T BEEN REVIEWED FOR
19:45:10  25 YEARS?
THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE HERE.
SO
19:45:13  THIS CASE REALLY PULLED THE COVERS OFF OF
19:45:19  SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN LEGAL BUT THE SCANDAL IS WHAT HAS BEEN LEGAL.
WHAT HAS BEEN
19:45:22  LEGAL IS THAT THE WIRELESS INDUSTRY HAS BEEN ABLE TO GET AWAY
19:45:26  BY THEIR DEEP POCKETS AND MONEY
19:45:31  BY CAPTURING AGENCIES THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO BE
19:45:34  DEFENDING US.
SO I'M GLAD TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS
19:45:37  AT ANY TIME AT EA TRUST DOT.ORG AND TALK ABOUT WHAT'S GOING
19:45:40  ON IN OTHER  COUNTRIES, SO JUST AS AN  EXAMPLE, SOME COUNTRY
19:45:43 IES HAVE NO CELL TOWER
19:45:47 S NEAR SCHOOLS OR MUCH LOWER RADIO FREQUENCY RADIATION
19:45:50  LIMITS COMPARED TO THE UNITED STATES, 10 TO
19:45:54  100 TIMES LOWER.
AND AS WELL, I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT
19:45:57  THAT THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS, IF YOU GO TO
19:46:01  THEIR WEBSITE IN ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS
19:46:04 , THEY TALK ABOUT HEADACHES, MEMORY PROBLEMS, DEPRESSION,
19:46:07  SLEEP PROBLEMS, THANK YOU SO MUCH AND I HOPE THAT YOU
19:46:10  MAKE A DECISION, YOUR HANDS ARE NOT TIED, YOU NEED TO DO SOMETHING
19:46:13  --
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU
19:46:16 .
AND THE NEXT SPEAKER IS YO
19:46:20 NGQIAN HUANG.

19:46:23  WAN
19:46:26 G.
WELCOME.

19:46:36 >> 
19:46:41  N
19:46:44 ONGQIA
19:46:48  YOU
19:46:51  ARE UNMUTED.
HELLO, CAN YOU HEAR US?

19:46:56 PERHAPS WE'LL SKIP TO THE NEXT SPEAKER AND COME BACK.

19:46:59 EDDIE?

19:47:04 >> YES, HI.
THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME HERE
19:47:08 .
I OWN A SMALL BUSINESS HERE IN FREMONT
19:47:11 .
I HAVE OWNED A BUSINESS SINCE
19:47:15  1997 IN FREMONT AND I AM A FREMONT RESIDENT UP
19:47:18  UNTIL ABOUT THREE MONTHS AGO.
THE BIGGEST
19:47:21  CONCERN THAT I HAVE, LACK OF COMMERCIAL
19:47:24  ENFORCEMENT IN COMMERCIAL AREAS
19:47:27 , AND THAT BEING SAID, I WANT TO ADD TO WHAT SOMEBODY
19:47:31  ELSE MENTIONED EARLIER.
ABANDONED VEHICLES WHICH
19:47:34  CREATE HOMELESSNESS, THAT
19:47:38  IS ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH ABANDONED VEHICLES AND THE CRIME THAT
19:47:41  COMES ALONG WITH THAT.
NOT JUST THE CRIME, IT'S THE LIT
19:47:44  LITTER, THE TRASH, AND IT'S
19:47:47  BAD FOR OUR COMMUNITY.

19:47:50 IT'S NOT JUST IMPACTING OUR BUSINESS.
BUT IT'S
19:47:54  ALSO DETRACTING FROM THE QUALITY OF LIFE
19:47:57  THAT FREMONT HAS ALWAYS HAD.

19:48:01 THIS IS A VERY TOUCHY SUBJECT FOR ME BECAUSE I'VE BEEN BORN
19:48:04  AND RAISED HERE, AND TO WATCH THE CHANGE, IT'S NOT FOR
19:48:07  THE  BETTER.
CASE IN POINT.
MY
19:48:10  BUSINESS, I NOW HAVE TO KEEP A LOT OF ALL THE TIMES THAT I
19:48:13  CONTACT THE POLICE DEPARTMENT FOR ENFORCEMENT
19:48:18 .
JUST LAST WEEK, I HAD AN ENCOUNTER WITH
19:48:21  A HOMELESS PERSON
19:48:25  THAT WAS --
19:48:28  IT SHOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED.
THEY WERE NOT CLOTHED, THEY
19:48:32  WERE CHEMICALLY ALTERED
19:48:35 , THEIR PERSONALITY, AND THEY WERE RUNNING AROUND WITH
19:48:38  THEIR ARMS FLAILING.
MY STORL IS
19:48:42  STORE IS OPEN TO THE PUBLIC.
I HAD WOMEN IN MY
19:48:45  AND CHILDREN IN MY BUSINESS AT THE TIME.

19:48:48 NOT ONLY DO I NOT FEEL SAFE FOR MY CUSTOMERS ANY LONGER, I
19:48:51  DON'T FEEL SAFE FOR OUR COMMUNITY, OR FOR MY
19:48:54  EMPLOYEES.
AND THIS IS NOT WHAT I WANT FOR, A, FREMONT
19:48:58 , B, MY BUSINESS, AND SOCIETY
19:49:01  AS A WHOLE SHOULD BE  BETTER THAN THIS.
IF WE
19:49:04  DON'T FIX THE PROBLEMS BEFORE THEY SPIN OUT OF CONTROL
19:49:07 , THE PROBLEMS BECOME WORSE.
AND THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE
19:49:10  SAYING NOW, JUST DRIVE
19:49:14  UP AND DOWN ALBRAE STREET.
IT'S VERY
19:49:17  BAD.
IT'S NOT SOMETHING I'M PROUD TO BE ASSOCIATED
19:49:20  WITH.
YOU KNOW, WE CAN
19:49:24  DO BETTER.
WE MUST DO BETTER.
WE HAVE
19:49:27  EXISTING LAWS THAT WE'RE CHOOSING TO ENFORCE
19:49:30  OR NOT ENFORCE.
AND THAT'S A PROBLEM
19:49:34 .
LIKE, WITH THAT SAID
19:49:37 , THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME
19:49:41 .

19:49:44 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
AND THE FINAL SPEAKER
19:49:49  AGAIN  IS --
19:49:52  I DON'T KNOW IF THEY'RE STILL THERE?
OKAY.
I THINK THAT WAS
19:49:55  THE LAST OF OUR
19:50:00  PUBLIC SPEAKERS.
I DON'T SEE YON
19:50:04 GQIAN.
I'D LIKE TO CLOSE PUBLIC COMMENT
19:50:07  AND I'D LIKE TO BRING IT BACK TO THE COUNCIL FOR
19:50:10  -- WE USUALLY DON'T ADDRESS PUBLIC COMMUNICATIONS
19:50:14 .
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, BECAUSE WE DON'T -- WE
19:50:17  CAN'T COMMENT ON THINGS THAT ARE NOT AGENDIZED.

19:50:20 >> Councilmember Kassan: OKAY.
I GUESS I DID HAVE A
19:50:23  QUESTION ABOUT THE TOPIC THAT WAS BROUGHT UP BY MANY SPEAKERS
19:50:27  FOR THE CITY ATTORNEY.
IS IT APPROPRIATE TO
19:50:30  ASK A QUESTION OR --
19:50:33 
>> Mayor Mei: I DON'T THINK WE CAN ADDRESS THINGS THAT ARE NOT 
19:50:36 AGENDIZED.
I'LL LEAVE THAT TO OUR COUNSEL, GENERAL COUNCIL
19:50:40  COUNSEL, DEBRA MARGOLIS.

19:50:42 >> Ms. Margolis: WE TYPICALLY DON'T ADDRESS ITEMS THAT ARE NOT ON THE AGENDA.

19:50:46 YOU CAN ASK A VERY BRIEF QUESTION OF STAFF OR YOU
19:50:49  CAN ASK AN ITEM BE AGENDIZED,
19:50:52  BUT THAT'S ABOUT IT.
>> Councilmember Kassan: OKAY.
I WOULD LIKE
19:50:55  THE ITEM TO BE AGENDIZED RELATED TO THE QUESTIONS
19:50:59  AROUND OUR RIGHTS AS A CITY WITH RESPECT TO
19:51:02  REGULATING SMALL CELL INFRASTRUCTURE
19:51:05 .
THANK YOU.

19:51:14 >> Mayor Mei: SURE.
WE'LL HAVE TO BRING THAT AGENDA ITEM UP
19:51:17  FOR THE FUTURE AND WE'LL HAVE THE APPROPRIATE STAFF, BUT I KNOW WE
19:51:20  HAVE ADDRESSED THIS AND WE CAN GIVE AN UPDATE AS TO
19:51:24  THE CURRENT LAW AND WHAT WE'VE BEEN ALREADY
19:51:29  -- COUNSEL TO.
GREAT.

19:51:33 NEXT, JUST TO
19:51:36  CLARIFY FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE LISTENING TO THIS, WE CANNOT ADDRESS
19:51:39  AGENDA ITEMS THAT ARE NOT AGENDIZED THIS EVENING.
BUT
19:51:42  AS COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN HAS ASKED, WE CAN LOOK
19:51:46  FOR ADDING THEM TO FUTURE AGENDA ITEMS
19:51:49 .
NEXT IS OUR CONSIDERATION OF A
19:51:52  CITY MANAGER CONTRACT, ITEM 7A
19:51:55  THIS EVENING.
AND OUR HUMAN RESOURCES
19:51:58  MANAGER,
19:52:01  ALAN, WILL INTRODUCE THE ITEM AND IS AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS.

19:52:06 >> GOOD EVENING, MAYOR, CITY COUNCIL
19:52:09 .
THE REPORT THAT WAS SUBMITTED OUTLINES
19:52:15  A CONTRACT WITH PROSPECTIVE
19:52:18  CITY MANAGER KARENA SHACKELFORD THAT'S CONSISTENT
19:52:22  WITH COUNCIL AUTHORIZATION.
THE REPORT OUTLINES
19:52:25  ELEMENTS OF COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS
19:52:29 .
I WOULD BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT
19:52:32  YOU HAVE ABOUT THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION.

19:52:38 >> Mayor Mei: SO AT THIS TIME, WE ARE ONLY TAKING QUESTIONS
19:52:41 , BUT -- FROM THE COUNCILMEMBERS AND
19:52:44  I THINK WE ALSO HAVE A MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC THAT WOULD LIKE TO ASK QUESTIONS
19:52:47  OR MAKE A COMMENT.
COUNCILMEMBER COX, DO YOU HAVE A QUESTION
19:52:51 ?
MY
19:52:54  APOLOGIES, COUNCILMEMBER COX, YOU ARE ON MUTE.
>> Councilmember Cox: I DON'T
19:52:57  HAVE A QUESTION RIGHT NOW, BUT CERTAINLY TO MAKE COMMENTS AFTER
19:53:00  THE PUBLIC COMMENTS.
>> Mayor Mei: SURE.
THANK YOU.

19:53:04 I'D LIKE TO TURN THIS OVER TO
19:53:07  ASK FOR PUBLIC COMMENT.
I SEE WE HAVE A HAND RAISED FROM CHRIS.

19:53:16 WELCOME, CHRIS.
>> I WOULD LIKE CITY GOVERNMENT
19:53:19  TO WORK THE WAY IT SHOULD, BUT THE
19:53:22  MERCURY NEWS CLEARLY
19:53:26  REPORTS THAT THIS PERSON HAS ALREADY RECEIVED THE JOB
19:53:30 .
SO
19:53:34  IT SEEMS, ARE WE DOING A FORMALITY HERE, OR DOES THE
19:53:37  CITY COUNCIL ACTUALLY MAKE THE DECISION WHEN THEY MAKE THE
19:53:40  DECISION?

19:53:43 BECAUSE WHAT I THINK FREMONT HAS FAILED TO REALIZE IS THEY GOT SUED
19:53:48  FOR DOING THINGS OUTSIDE THE CITY COUNCIL, AND THIS
19:53:51   CLEARLY PROVES THEY'VE DONE SOMETHING
19:53:54  OUTSIDE OF CITY COUNCIL MEETINGS, BECAUSE THERE'S
19:53:58  ALREADY A THING IN THE NEWSPAPER THAT SAYS SHE'S GOTTEN THE JOB.

19:54:02 I HAVE NOTHING AGAINST HER.
AND I WANT TO BE CLEAR ABOUT THAT
19:54:05 .
AND SHE'S PROBABLY TOTALLY QUALIFIED FOR THE JOB.

19:54:09 MY ISSUE IS, IT'S ALREADY REPORT
19:54:13  REPORTED IT BEEN DONE, WHICH MEANS THAT THE CITY COUNCIL
19:54:16  DECISION HERE IS
19:54:20  ALREADY BEEN LEAKED OR IT'S ALREADY MADE A DECISION.
BUT THE
19:54:23  BROWN ACT PREVENTS THAT FROM HAPPENING, AND YOU GUYS HAVE
19:54:26  ALREADY BEEN SUED FOR THAT.
SO I THINK THE CITY COUNCIL NEEDS
19:54:29  TO WAKE UP TO
19:54:34  WHAT THEY DO HERE.
YOU EITHER DO THINGS BY THE LAW OR
19:54:38  YOU DON'T DO THEM.
BUT YOU
19:54:41  CONTINUE TO DO THINGS THAT ARE NOT ALLOWED BY THE LAW
19:54:45 .
THANK YOU.

19:54:49 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
AND NOW I WILL
19:54:52  CLOSE THE PUBLIC COMMENT AND BRING IT BACK TO THE COUNCIL
19:54:55  FOR COMMENTS. AT THIS TIME BEFORE
19:54:58  WE MAKE A VOTE, AND WE CAN ALSO HAVE COUNCIL ADDRESS
19:55:02  SOME OF THE COMMENTS ABOUT PROCEDURE
19:55:05 S.
COUNCILMEMBER COX.
>> Councilmember Cox: YES.

19:55:09 I WOULD FIRST LIKE TO HAVE DEBRA
19:55:12  ADDRESS HOW THE DECISION WAS MADE.

19:55:18 >> Ms. Margolis: I'D BE HAPPY TO.
THE CITY COUNCIL MET IN
19:55:21  A  LEGALLY NOTICED CLOSED SESSION LAST
19:55:24  WEEK, WHERE THEY CONSIDERED THE POSSIBILITY OF APPOINTING A
19:55:28  NEW CITY MANAGER, AND THEY DID DECIDE TO
19:55:31  APPOINT KARENA SHACKELFORD.
HOWEVER, THAT APPOINTMENT IS
19:55:34  NOT EFFECTIVE UNTIL AN EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT
19:55:37  WITH MS. SHACKELFORD IS APPROVED IN OPEN
19:55:40  SESSION BY THIS COUNCIL.
SO WHILE
19:55:44  THE COUNCIL EXPRESSED
19:55:47  THEIR DESIRES LAST WEEK, IT'S NOT AN OFFICIAL ACTION UNTIL
19:55:50  TONIGHT'S EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT IS APPROVED, AND THAT'S
19:55:53  WHY WE'RE HERE TONIGHT.

19:55:56 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU, DEBRA, FOR THAT CLARIFICATION
19:55:58 .
>> Councilmember Cox: I HAD ONE OTHER PART.

19:56:01 I WAS JUST GOING TO EMPHASIZE THAT
19:56:05  IN LOOKING AT THE RESUME AND THE
19:56:08  HER EXPERIENCES, THAT KARENA
19:56:12  SHACKELFORD HAS OVER 20 YEARS OF GOVERNMENT EXPERIENCE, INCLUDING SERVE
19:56:15 ING IN OUR CITY OF FREMONT AS AN
19:56:19  ASSISTANT CITY MANAGER
19:56:22 .
AND BASED ON DIFFERENT EXPERIENCES
19:56:25  THAT SHE HAS REALLY WORKED WELL WITH EVERY
19:56:28 ONE, SHE'S BORN AND RAISED IN FREMONT, AND GRADUATED
19:56:32  FROM IRVINGTON HIGH SCHOOL, AND
19:56:36  ALL OF US HAVE MOVED FORWARD TO BELIEVE THAT KARENA
19:56:39  IS THE BEST CHOICE FOR FREMONT, AND SO
19:56:42  I WOULD LIKE TO MOVE FORTH THE MOTION
19:56:46  TO APPROVE THE EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT
19:56:49  THAT IS BEFORE US AND TO APPOINT KARENA SHACKELFORD
19:56:53  AS THE APPOINTED CITY MANAGER.

19:56:57 >> Councilmember Keng: I WILL SECOND THAT.
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY.

19:57:00 WELL, THAT'S FINE.
I THINK, RAJ, COUNCILMEMBER
19:57:03  SALWAN, DID YOU HAVE YOUR HAND UP I SAW EARLIER
19:57:06 ?
>> Councilmember Salwan: I JUST WANTED THE CITY ATTORNEY TO CLARIFY THE 
19:57:08 PROCESS, SO SHE DID A GOOD JOB.
THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

19:57:11 I WAS GOING TO SAY, I THOUGHT I SAW YOUR HAND
19:57:15  UP AND I WAS WONDERING THAT.
SO THANK YOU.
WE HAVE A MOTION BY
19:57:18  COUNCILMEMBER COX AND A SECOND BY COUNCILMEMBER KENG.
AND
19:57:21  I JUST WANTED TO SHARE REAL QUICKLY THAT I VERY MUCH ENJOY
19:57:24 ED THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH KARENA
19:57:27  IN MANY DIFFERENT CAPACITIES, BOTH AS A SCHOOL BOARD
19:57:31  MEMBER IN THE PAST AND ALSO AS A CITY COUNCILMEMBER AND MAYOR
19:57:34 .
AND SO I LOOK FORWARD TO PARTNERING WITH HER IN THIS CONTINUED
19:57:38  EFFORT TO HELP US BRING THE COMMUNITY
19:57:42  FORWARD, AND I HAVE FULL CONFIDENCE IN HER ABILITIES.

19:57:45 AND SO WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND.

19:57:48 AND THANK YOU, DEBRA, FOR THE CLARIFICATION OF THE
19:57:51  PROCESS, BECAUSE IT IS OFFICIAL ONCE WE RATIFY AND APPROVE
19:57:54  THE CONTRACT.
AND SO IF
19:57:57  WE HAVE A ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE, MS. GAW
19:58:01  GAUTHIER?
>> Ms. Gauthier: YES, MADAME MAYOR.

19:58:05 COUNCILMEMBER COX, AYE.
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN, AYE.
COUNCILMEMBER
19:58:08  KASSAN, AYE.

19:58:11 COUNCILMEMBER JONES, AYE.
COUNCILMEMBER
19:58:14  KENG, AYE.
VICE MAYOR SHAO
19:58:18 , AYE.
MAYOR MEI, AYE.

19:58:21 SO THE MOTION PASSES  UNANIMOUSLY.
AND
19:58:24  I'D LIKE TO BE THE FIRST TO
19:58:27  CONGRATULATE MS. SHACKELFORD IN HER NEW ROLE AS OUR
19:58:30  CITY MANAGER, AND I CAN SEE RICK WAS CLAP
19:58:33 PING.
OR I COULD HEAR IT VIRTUALLY.
AND WE
19:58:36  LOOK FORWARD TO THE EFFORTS IN TERMS OF MOVING
19:58:40  US FORWARD AS A COMMUNITY, ESPECIALLY IN THESE CHALLENGING
19:58:43  TIMES.
AND SO MY BEST WISHES TO YOU AND YOUR
19:58:46  FAMILY, AND PLEASE SAY HI TO YOUR PARENTS AND YOUR
19:58:49  FAMILY FOR US.
SO THANK YOU.
CONGRATULATIONS.

19:58:55 THAT WAS THE LAST REGULARLY SCHEDULED AGENDA ITEM THIS
19:58:58  EVENING.

19:59:02 I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS.

19:59:05 THERE WILL BE A STATE OF THE CITY ON THURSDAY, SO I'D LIKE TO INVITE PEOPLE
19:59:08  TO PLEASE JOIN US FOR THAT.
AND WE
19:59:11  WILL LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH ALL OF YOU AS WE MOVE
19:59:14  FORWARD.
WE ALSO HAVE, I BELIEVE, A JOINT SCHOOL
19:59:18  BOARD AND CITY COUNCIL MEETING WITH THE ADVISORY
19:59:22  -- JOINT COMMISSION HERE -- MEETING I THINK NEXT WEEK ALSO
19:59:25 .
SO -- AND ALSO FINALLY, IN CLOSING, WE
19:59:28  WOULD LOVE FOR PEOPLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE REDISTRICTING DISCUSSIONS
19:59:32 .
THAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW, AFTER OUR CENSUS, BOTH
19:59:36  AT THE COUNTY, STATE,
19:59:39  AND WILL BE ALSO HAPPENING AT THE
19:59:44  CITY LEVEL.
WE HAVE FOUR PUBLIC HEARINGS BEFORE WE'LL MAKE
19:59:47  SOME DISCUSSIONS ON THE MAPS.
SO
19:59:50  I ALSO WANTED, IN CLOSING, JUST TO PAUSE FOR A MOMENT
19:59:54  OF SILENCE.
I KNOW IT'S BEEN A VERY TOUGH WEEK.

19:59:57 WE'VE LOST SOME DEAR FRIENDS AND ALSO
20:00:00  SOME LEADERS, AND SO I WOULD HOPE FOR MORE PEACE
20:00:03 , MORE HEALING, AND SO I'M JUST GOING TO PAUSE FOR A MOMENT OF
20:00:06   SILENCE.

20:00:17 THANK YOU SO MUCH, AND AS WE HIT THE SAD NUMBER OF OVER
20:00:20  700,000 LIVES LOST, WE ASK THAT ALL OF YOU BE KIND TO ONE ANOTHER
20:00:24  AND TO WORK WITH US TO KEEP US  MOVING
20:00:27  FORWARD AND STAYING HEALTHY.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME, FOR YOUR
20:00:30  SUPPORT, AND BE SAFE AND BE WELL.
HAVE A GOOD EVENING.
