19:06:56 >> EVENING.

19:07:00 THIS IS A DIRECT REQUEST TO THE CITY MANAGER TO ASK THE CITY MANAGER TO 
19:07:04 AUTHORIZE THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS TO REINSTATE THE NO PARKING ZONE 
19:07:07 IN THE LOADING ZONE ON RANCHO ARROYO PARKWAY.

19:07:10 THE CHANGES WERE MADE WITHOUT NOTICE AND WITHOUT SEEKING APPROVAL OF THE 
19:07:13 CITY COUNCIL TO OVERTURN THE EXISTING CITY COUNCIL RULINGS.

19:07:22 THIS HAS CREATED MORE HAZARDOUS AND RESTRICTED ACCESS ENTRY TO A 
19:07:23 GEOGRAPHICALLY RESTRICTED NEIGHBORHOOD.

19:07:28 THE DEFENSE OF THESE ACTIONS ARE FALSE, MISLEADING, AND FRANKLY ILLEGAL.

19:07:33 THE NEIGHBORHOOD HAS SUPPLIED ACTUAL COUNTS DOCUMENTATION, ORDINANCES AND 
19:07:33 SAFETY.

19:07:43 AT THE VERY LEAST, PUT IT ON THE CALENDAR OR REVIEW THIS PORTION OF 
19:07:49 WHAT HAS BEEN DONE COMPLETELY OUT OF THE SCOPE OF THE PROJECT.

19:07:49 THANK YOU.

19:07:52 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:07:54 NEXT SPEAKER IS DAVID.

19:07:55 WELCOME.

19:08:06 >> HELLO, RESPECTED MAYOR AND COUNCILMEN AND WOMEN.

19:08:10 I JUST WANTED TODAY -- I WAS VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE WAY EVERYTHING WAS 
19:08:18 RUSHED THROUGH FOR THE HOMEKEY PROJECT, AND I WOULD HAVE EXPECTED MORE 
19:08:18 TRANSPARENCY.

19:08:26 WE AS A PUBLIC ARE NOT NECESSARILY AGAINST HELPING  HOMELESS FOLKS BUT 
19:08:32 THERE IS NO TRANSPARENCY, NOBODY KNOWS WHAT THE PROGRAM IS, EVERYBODY IS 
19:08:38 CONFUSED, THERE WAS NO DEBATE, IT WAS RUSHED THROUGH A FEW SHORT DAYS, LIKE 
19:08:42 FOUR DAYS, AND THIS PROJECT HAS BEEN LYING AROUND IN THE CITY RECORDS, IN 
19:08:46 HIND SIGHT WE -- SEE FOR MONTHS AND THIS IS KIND OF UNACCEPTABLE THAT THIS 
19:08:51 IS ALL BEING SWEPT THROUGH UNDER THE RUG AND ALSO SAME THING HAPPENED WITH 
19:08:55 -- PARKING, IT JUST CAME THROUGH BOOM, BOOM, BOOM, IT WAS JUST IMPLEMENTED 
19:08:58 AND THAT'S NOT THE RIGHT WAY TO DO IT.

19:09:02 SO I WOULD APPEAL TO HAVE A TOWN HALL MEETING --

19:09:03 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:09:06 THE NEXT SPEAKER IS LEI.

19:09:12 >> HELLO, DEAR COUNCILMEMBERS.

19:09:18 I'M CALLING ALSO REGARDING THE HOMEKEY PROJECT.

19:09:24 I AGREE WITH THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER, THE WHOLE PROCESS HAS BEEN RUSHED INTO 
19:09:31 SOME ACTION WITHOUT THE -- SURROUNDING CITIZENS.

19:09:39 I WANTED TO REMIND EVERYONE THAT THE INCIDENT HAPPENED ON JANUARY 31ST, 
19:09:45 2022, HOMELESS FELONY, ATTACKED ASIAN WOMAN IN HEAD WITH A BASEBALL BAT.

19:09:56 THESE HOMELESS PEOPLE LIVE ABOUT 5 FEET FROM THE INCIDENT HAPPENS IN -- 
19:09:57 HOUSING THAT IS HOMELESS HOUSING PROJECT.

19:10:07 I KNOW THAT THE CITY WAS PLANNING TO SEND OUT INFORMATION CARDS TO PEOPLE 
19:10:09 WITHIN 300 FEET BUT IT DIDN'T HAPPEN.

19:10:12 WHAT DID CITY SAY ABOUT THE 500 FEET?

19:10:17 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:10:18 NEXT SPEAKER IS JOE ROSE.

19:10:32 HELLO?

19:10:45 >> Ms. Gauthier: MAYOR, WE CAN RE-START THE TIMER AND MOVE ON TO JENNIFER 
19:10:45 PARE.

19:10:45 >> Mayor Mei: OKAY, THANK YOU.

19:10:49 JENNIFER?

19:10:49 >> GOOD EVENING.

19:10:50 I'M HERE.

19:10:53 JENNIFER PARE.

19:10:54 THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TONIGHT.

19:10:57 I ALSO WANT TO COMMENT ON THE HOMEKEY HOUSING PROJECT.

19:11:02 AND I'D LIKE TO ADD MY VOICE OF SUPPORT FOR THIS PROJECT.

19:11:07 I DO SO AS SOMEONE WHO HAS LIVED AND WORKED IN FREMONT FOR SOME 20 YEARS 
19:11:10 AND I SEE THE CRITICAL NEED FOR MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN OUR COMMUNITY.

19:11:17 I'M ALSO HERE AS A REPRESENTATIVE OF KIDAN DW. O.

19:11:21 GO.

19:11:26 ONE OF OUR FIRST PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS IN FREMONT IS ON BROWN ROAD IN THE WARM 
19:11:26 SPRINGS DISTRICT.

19:11:32 IT'S SITUATED LITERALLY STEPS AWAY NEXT DOOR TO SUNRISE VILLAGE, SHELTER FOR 
19:11:32 THE HOMELESS.

19:11:37 SINCE 1993, ALMOST 30 YEARS AGO, OUR PRESCHOOL HAS SERVED YOUNG CHILDREN 
19:11:45 AND THEIR FAMILIES FULL DAY, MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY, WITH ALMOST NO 
19:11:46 INCIDENTS.

19:11:48 WE HAVE NEVER HAD A NEGATIVE EXPERIENCE WITH THE HOMELESS SHELTER.

19:11:52 OUR CHILDREN, FAMILIES AND OUR STAFF HAVE NEVER FELT UNSAFE.

19:11:57 SO WITH --

19:11:57 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:12:01 THE NEXT SPEAKER IS LISA DANZ.

19:12:05 >> HI.

19:12:11 MY NAME IS LISA DANZ, AND I LIVE IN FREMONT IN THE SUN -- NEIGHBORHOOD.

19:12:15 I WANT TO THANK THE CITY FOR PROVIDING FAQs ABOUT THE MOTEL 6 HOMEKEY 
19:12:15 PROJECT.

19:12:19 IN CASE ANYBODY LISTENING IN TODAY HASN'T HAD A CHANCE TO READ ALL OF 
19:12:23 THEM YET, I'D LIKE TO READ A QUICK EXCERPT FROM QUESTION 22.

19:12:27 THAT SAYS, THE FREMONT POLICE DEPARTMENT ANALYZED DATA, AND THERE'S 
19:12:30 A LOT OF DETAIL ABOUT WHAT THEY FOUND WHICH I WON'T READ DUE TO THE TIME 
19:12:33 LIMIT, THEN IT CONTINUES, THE FREMONT POLICE DEPARTMENT SUPPORTS FRAN 
19:12:38 SITIONING THE CURRENT MOTEL TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING APARTMENTS AND 
19:12:41 BELIEVES THIS PROJECT WOULD HELP REDUCE CRIME AT THAT SPECIFIC LOCATION.

19:12:42 AND THAT'S THE QUOTE.

19:12:46 WITH THAT, I STRONGLY SUPPORT AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND I COMMEND THE 
19:12:52 CITY FOR TAKING ACTION TO BRING 156 SUPPORTIVE HOUSING UNITS TO FREMONT.

19:12:52 THANK YOU.

19:12:55 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:12:57 WE'RE GOING TO GO BACK TO JOE ROSE.

19:12:59 IF THEY'RE ABLE TO SPEAK NOW.

19:13:09 JOE ROSE?

19:13:14 OKAY.

19:13:18 WE'LL GO TO NAVIN.

19:13:19 I'M LOOKING AT THE TIME.

19:13:22 I'M THINKING THIS WILL BE THE LAST SPEAKER PROBABLY BEFORE I HAVE TO TURN 
19:13:25 BACK TO THE REDISTRICTING HEARING.

19:13:30 >> HI, GOOD EVENING, EVERYBODY.

19:13:33 THIS IS NAVIN HERE.

19:13:38 I VEHEMENTLY OPPOSE THE HOMEKEY PROJECT.

19:13:42 NOT NECESSARILY THAT AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND FOR THE HOMELESS SHOULD NOT BE 
19:13:49 PROVIDED, BUT THE WAY THE PROCESS WAS RUSHED THROUGH AND FRANKLY WE JUST 
19:13:51 CAME TO KNOW A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO ABOUT THIS PROJECT.

19:14:00 SO MY FIRST POINT IS THE OPPOSITION OF THE LOCATION AND THE PROCESS, AND MY 
19:14:08 SECOND POINT IS, WE ALL SPEAK ON EVERY OCCASION DURING THESE REGULAR MEETINGS 
19:14:10 AND I DON'T KNOW IF THERE WAS ANY TOWN HALL MEETING.

19:14:17 WHAT IS BEING DONE TO ADDRESS OUR ISSUES, THIS IS A DIRECT QUESTION TO 
19:14:21 THE MAYOR, LILY MEI, WHAT IS BEING DONE TO ADDRESS OUR ISSUES, YOU BEING OUR 
19:14:21 MAYOR?

19:14:26 I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW THAT, BECAUSE THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR US AS 
19:14:26 CITIZENS OF THIS COMMUNITY.

19:14:29 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:14:33 AND AT THIS TIME, WE'RE GOING TO TURN IT BACK TO OUR  REDISTRICTING BECAUSE 
19:14:39 I DO NOT THINK WE HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO BEGIN, AND I JUST WANTED TO MAKE A 
19:14:43 GENERAL COMMENT THAT ALL OF THESE HAVE BEEN AGENDIZED AND JUST LIKE THIS ITEM 
19:14:46 THIS EVENING FOR OUR REDISTRICTING, WE ASK THAT THE PUBLIC FOLLOW OUR AGENDA 
19:14:51 AND THAT'S WHAT HAS BEEN GIVEN AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO EXPRESS THE FEEDBACK.

19:14:53 SO AT THIS TIME --

19:14:55 [RECORDING STOPPED]

19:15:01 >> Mayor Mei: I'M GOING TO TRANSFER TO THE REDISTRICTING PROCESS, AND I'D 
19:15:05 LIKE TO INFORM THE PUBLIC THAT DUE TO REQUESTS WE WILL HAVE INTERPRETATION

19:20:15 >> GREAT.

19:20:19 GOOD EVENING, MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL, MADAME MAYOR, AS WELL AS MEMBERS OF 
19:20:20 THE PUBLIC.

19:20:27 WE ARE NOW ENGAGING IN OUR THIRD PUBLIC HEARING OF OUR  REDISTRICTING PROCESS, 
19:20:30 SO REALLY ENCOURAGING AND THANK THE PUBLIC FOR THEIR INPUT THUS FAR IN 
19:20:36 THIS PROCESS, AS WELL AS ENCOURAGING CONTINUED ENGAGEMENT THROUGHOUT THE 
19:20:40 THIRD AND FOURTH PUBLIC  HEARINGS AS WE APPROACH THE DEADLINE IN APRIL.

19:20:46 NOW I WANT TO INTRODUCE KRISTIN PARKS OF NATIONAL DEMOGRAPHICS CORPORATION 
19:20:49 WHO THE CITY HAS BEEN CONSULTING WITH AS OUR DEMOGRAPHIC CONSULTANT  
19:20:55 THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS, AND KRISTIN WILL BE LEADING THIS MEETING, 
19:21:00 PROVIDING A PRESENTATION FOR THE PUBLIC AND THE COUNCIL, AND THEN OPENING IT 
19:21:01 UP TO YOU ALL FOR DISCUSSION.

19:21:04 SO KRISTEN, TAKE IT AWAY.

19:21:04 THANK YOU.

19:21:08 >> THANK YOU, AMANDA.

19:21:11 GOOD EVENING, MAYOR, COUNCIL AND MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC.

19:21:13 I AM GOING TO SHARE MY SCREEN HERE.

19:21:20 I DO HAVE A RELATIVELY BRIEF POWERPOINT PRESENTATION JUST TO REVIEW WHERE 
19:21:27 WE'VE BEEN IN THIS PROCESS, WHERE WE'RE GOING, AND WHAT NEW MAPS WE HAVE TO 
19:21:27 CONSIDER THIS EVENING.

19:21:36 SO AS THE MAYOR SAID, WE DO HAVE AN ADDITIONAL PUBLIC HEARING COMING UP 
19:21:41 AFTER THIS ONE TONIGHT ON APRIL 5TH, SO THIS IS IMPORTANT FOR MEMBERS OF THE 
19:21:41 PUBLIC.

19:21:45 IF YOU HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO REVIEW THE DRAFT MAPS, I'LL SHOW YOU THE 
19:21:48 WEBSITE WHERE YOU CAN DO THAT.

19:21:53 IT REDISTRICTFREMONT.ORG, AND IF YOU HAVE FEEDBACK ON THE DRAFT MAPS THAT 
19:21:57 ARE PRESENTED TONIGHT OR ANY OF THE OTHER MAPS, PLEASE MAKE SURE THAT YOU 
19:22:02 SEND THAT IN TO THE COUNCIL SO THEY CAN RECEIVE YOUR FEEDBACK.

19:22:13 THE DEADLINE IS APRIL 17TH SO WE ARE ON TRACK FOR THE CITY TO ADOPT A NEW 
19:22:14 DISTRICT MAP.

19:22:21 MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL HAVE SEEN THIS SLIDE SEVERAL TIMES, BUT I DO LIKE TO 
19:22:24 REVIEW BECAUSE WHEN WE DISCUSS THE DRAFT MAPS THAT I'LL BE SHOWING YOU IN 
19:22:27 JUST A MOMENT, WE'LL BE REFERRING BACK TO THE LEGAL CRITERIA.

19:22:35 SO FIRST AND ALWAYS FOREMOST IS OUR FEDERAL LAW.

19:22:40 THE FIRST REQUIREMENT FOR DISTRICT MAPS UNDER FEDERAL LAW IS THAT EACH 
19:22:42 DISTRICT HAD EQUAL POPULATION.

19:22:49 WHAT THAT MEANS IS EQUAL POPULATION NOT DOWN TO THE VERY LAST PERSON BUT 
19:22:54 WITHIN A TOTAL DEVIATION OF 10% FROM THE  LARGEST DISTRICT TO THE SMALLEST 
19:22:55 DISTRICT.

19:23:03 WE MUST ALSO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH THE FEDERAL VOTING RIGHTS ACT, AND ENSURE 
19:23:07 THAT DISTRICTS ARE NOT DILUTING THE VOTING POWER OF PROTECTED CLASSES OF 
19:23:12 VOTERS SO THAT WOULD INCLUDE ASIAN AMERICAN VOTERS, AFRICAN AMERICAN 
19:23:15 VOTERS, LATINOS, AND NATIVE AMERICAN VOTERS.

19:23:23 WHILE WE ARE LOOKING AT RACE AND ETHNICITY TO SOME EXTENT, WE CANNOT 
19:23:29  DRAW DISTRICTS BASED  SOLELY ON THOSE FACTORS OR THAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED 
19:23:31 RACIAL GERRYMANDERING, SO WE WANT TO AVOID THAT.

19:23:33 WE WILL BE LOOKING AT OTHER FACTORS AS WELL.

19:23:41 CALIFORNIA LAW IS THE NEXT BODY OF LEGAL REQUIREMENTS WE MUST FOLLOW.

19:23:46 CALIFORNIA LAW GIVES US FOUR RANK-ORDERED CRITERIA AND THEY ARE 
19:23:53 ORDERED IN ORDER OF IMPORTANCE, MEANING WE MUST CONSIDER NUMBER ONE FIRST, 
19:23:55 THEN NUMBER TWO, THREE, FOUR.

19:24:02 THE FIRST IS SIMPLY THAT DISTRICTS ARE GEOGRAPHICALLY CONTIGUOUS.

19:24:08 WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT EACH DISTRICT SHOULD BE ONE COMPLETE PIECE WITH NO 
19:24:09 DISCONNECTED  AREAS.

19:24:14 SECOND, WE WANT TO MINIMIZE THE DIVISION OF NEIGHBORHOOD AND 
19:24:15 COMMUNITIES OF INTEREST.

19:24:23 ONE WAY TO THINK ABOUT WHAT A DISTRICT IS, IT IS A COLLECTION OR GROUPING OF 
19:24:24 NEIGHBORHOODS AND COMMUNITIES.

19:24:29 AND WHAT OUR GOAL IS IS TO DETERMINE WHICH NEIGHBORHOODS AND COMMUNITIES 
19:24:33 SHOULD BE  GROUPED TOGETHER IN WHICH DISTRICTS.

19:24:40 THIRD, STATE LAW SAYS WE SHOULD CREATE EASILY IDENTIFIABLE BOUNDARIES BETWEEN 
19:24:41 OUR  DISTRICTS.

19:24:48 SO THIS IS WHY WE MAY DRAW BOUNDARY LINES ALONG MAJOR ROADS, WATERWAYS OR 
19:24:54 OTHER FEATURES, AND FINALLY THE LAST CRITERION UNDER STAY LAW IS THAT 
19:24:55 DISTRICTS SHOULD BE COMPACT.

19:25:00 SO THIS IS SOMETHING I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT TONIGHT, BECAUSE IT CAN BE 
19:25:03 DIFFICULT TO DRAW DISTRICTS THAT ARE COMPACT.

19:25:09 AND OFTEN WHEN WE LOOK AT THE SHAPE OF DISTRICTS, IF THEY ARE SNAKING AROUND 
19:25:13 AND THEY'RE AVOIDING TAKING IN A CERTAIN AREA SO THEY CAN GO FARTHER 
19:25:18 AWAY AND TAKE IN A MORE DISTANT AREA, WE WOULD SAY THAT DISTRICT IS NOT 
19:25:19 COMPACT.

19:25:26 SO WHILE IT IS LAST IN ORDER OF IMPORTANCE, WE DO STILL WANT TO KEEP 
19:25:28 IT IN MIND WHEN WE ARE LOOKING AT THE DRAFT MAPS.

19:25:30 SO THOSE ARE THE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS.

19:25:36 WE CAN CERTAINLY PURSUE OTHER GOALS, BUT FIRST AND FOREMOST, WE WANT TO 
19:25:41 MAKE SURE THAT THE MAPS THAT ARE BEING PRIORITIZED FOR ADOPTION BY THE 
19:25:42 COUNCIL MEET THE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS.

19:25:47 SO HERE IS THE CURRENT DISTRICT MAP.

19:25:48 THIS IS OUR BASELINE.

19:25:58 THIS MAP WAS ADOPTED IN 2017, WENT INTO EFFECT IN 2018, AND THIS WAS THE FIRST 
19:26:02 TIME THAT THE CITY OF FREMONT HAD DISTRICTS.

19:26:08 SO THESE DISTRICTS WERE DROWN USING 2010 CENSUS POPULATION NUMBERS.

19:26:14 SO NOW THAT THE 2020 CENSUS HAS CONCLUDED, WE NEED TO REVISIT THESE 
19:26:20 BOUNDARIES FIRST AND FOREMOST TO ENSURE THAT EQUAL POPULATION REQUIREMENT OF 
19:26:22 THE FEDERAL LAW IS MET.

19:26:29 SO THAT IS WHY WE'RE HERE ON THIS PROCESS, AND AS YOU'LL SEE, WHEN WE 
19:26:38 LOOK AT THOSE EXISTING DISTRICTS AND WE LOOK AT THEIR POPULATION IN 2020, WE 
19:26:47 DO SEE THAT THE TOTAL DEVIATION IS ABOVE 10%, WHICH IS CONSIDERED NOT 
19:26:47 LEGALLY PERMISSIBLE.

19:26:53 THAT MAXIMUM DEVIATION UNDER FEDERAL LAW, COURTS HAVE DEEMED TO BE 10%.

19:26:58 SO WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT THE DRAFT MAPS THIS EVENING, WE ARE GOING TO BE 
19:27:03 LOOKING FOR MAPS THAT BRING THAT TOTAL POPULATION DEVIATION UNDER 10%.

19:27:11 WHAT THAT MEANS, IF ANY OF YOU HAVE SAT DOWN TO DRAW A  SIX-DISTRICT MAP FOR 
19:27:15 FREMONT, WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT IF YOU TAKE THE TOTAL 2020 POPULATION OF THE 
19:27:19 CITY AND YOU DIVIDE IT BY 6, THE NUMBER OF DISTRICTS, WE'RE LOOKING FOR EACH 
19:27:25 DISTRICT TO HAVE APPROXIMATELY 38,441 PEOPLE.

19:27:27 SO THERE'S THE MAP.

19:27:32 I'M NOT GOING TO GO OVER THIS BUT IT'S JUST HERE FOR  REFERENCE, SO THAT WE 
19:27:36 CAN BE TOTALLY TRANSPARENT AS TO WHAT OUR NUMBERS ARE.

19:27:42 AND THE STAFF REPORT THIS EVENING ALSO MENTIONED THE SURVEY THAT CITY STAFF 
19:27:44  CONDUCTED.

19:27:49 WE'VE ALSO BEEN COLLECTING PUBLIC TESTIMONY DURING THESE HEARINGS AND 
19:27:51 VIA EMAIL AND OTHER WRITTEN CORRESPONDENCE.

19:27:59 THIS IS JUST A SAMPLE OF SOME OF THE NEIGHBORHOODS OR THE COMMUNITIES THAT 
19:28:05 HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AS NOT JUST EXISTING IN FREMONT, BUT NEIGHBORHOODS 
19:28:10 THAT SHOULD NOT BE DIVIDED INTO MULTIPLE CITY COUNCIL DISTRICTS.

19:28:15 SO WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT NEIGHBORHOODS AND COMMUNITIES OF 
19:28:17 INTEREST, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT NEIGHBORHOODS AND COMMUNITIES THAT 
19:28:21 WANT TO BE KEPT WHOLE WITHIN ONE CITY COUNCIL  DISTRICT.

19:28:25 SO WE WILL REFER TO SOME OF THESE WHEN WE LOOK AT THE MAPS AS WELL.

19:28:28 SO, MAPS.

19:28:33 IT'S ACTUALLY -- IT SHOULD BE 14 MAPS NOW, BECAUSE WE HAD ONE MORE THAT WE 
19:28:39 INNED UP ADDING SINCE I BELIEVE THE STAFF REPORT WAS WRITTEN.

19:28:46 AND WHAT THAT IS IS 11 MAPS FROM THE PUBLIC AND THREE MAPS THAT MY FIRM, 
19:28:50 NATIONAL DEMOGRAPHICS, HAS BEEN PREPARED FOR THE CITY.

19:28:57 NOW THE VERY FIRST THING THAT WE DO WITH ALL OF THE MAPS THAT ARE RECEIVED 
19:29:05 IS WE LOOK TO SEE IF THEY'RE COMPLETE, DID EVERY PART OF THE CITY GET 
19:29:06 ASSIGNED TO A DISTRICT?

19:29:09 DID EVERY BLOCK GET ASSIGNED?

19:29:14 AND IF THAT'S NOT THE CASE, THEN THE MAP IS INCOMPLETE.

19:29:19 THE SECOND THING THAT WE LOOK AT IS, ARE THE DISTRICTS  CONTIGUOUS?

19:29:23 SO ALL OF THESE MAPS HERE ARE CONTIGUOUS.

19:29:25 SO THAT WASN'T AN ISSUE.

19:29:31 THEN WE LOOK AT POPULATION EQUALITY, MEETING THAT FEDERAL EQUAL POPULATION 
19:29:32 RULE.

19:29:39 AND WE LOOK TO SEE IF THE TOTAL DEVIATION IS WITHIN THAT ZERO TO 10% 
19:29:41 RANGE THAT'S LEGALLY PERMISSIBLE.

19:29:49 SO WHEN YOU SEE THE MAPS HERE ON THE SLIDE LABELED NOT POPULATION BALL 
19:29:56  POP LAITION BALANCED, IT HAS A TOTAL DEVIATION GREATER THAN 10%, WHICH 
19:30:01 MEANS THAT THEY WOULD LIKELY BE DEEMED NON-LEGALLY COMPLIANT OR ILLEGAL.

19:30:09 SO THAT'S WHAT THOSE INDICATIONS ARE, AND THE YELLOW HIGHLIGHTED MAPS HERE 
19:30:16 ARE THE NEW ONES THAT HAVE NOT YET BEEN PUBLICLY PRESENTED AT A PUBLIC 
19:30:16 HEARING.

19:30:20 SO THOSE ARE THE ONES I'M GOING TO LOOK AT A LITTLE MORE CLOSELY THIS EVENING, 
19:30:27 BUT ALL OF THE  MAPS ARE AVAILABLE ONLINE BOTH IN A PDF FORM IF THEY ARE 
19:30:32 A COMPLETE BALANCED MAP AND ON THE INTERACTIVE REVIEW MAP.

19:30:36 SO IF YOU WANT TO FOLLOW ALONG, DEFINITELY GO TO THE WEBSITE SO YOU 
19:30:40 CAN PULL THESE MAPS UP IF YOU ARE ON YOUR OWN COMPUTER.

19:30:49 THE OTHER THING I WANT TO MENTION IS YOU'LL ALSO SEE FOR PUBLIC MAP 80170 
19:30:55 AND NDC MINIMAL CHANGE, THAT I'VE NOTED THAT THOSE MAPS DIVIDE COIs.

19:30:57 WHAT THAT MEANS IS COMMUNITIES OF INTEREST.

19:31:05 SO WHEN WE PREVIOUSLY PRESENTED THOSE MAPS, WE RECEIVED FEEDBACK FROM 
19:31:08 COUNCIL AND THE PUBLIC THAT THOSE MAPS WERE DIVIDING COMMUNITIES THAT DID NOT 
19:31:09 WANT TO BE DIVIDED.

19:31:12 SO I'M JUST NOTING THAT THERE.

19:31:19 IT DOESN'T MEAN THE MAPS NECESSARILY HAVE LEGAL VIOLATIONS BUT IT IS A RED 
19:31:28 FLAG AND IT MAY NOT BE -- THOSE MAPS MAY NOT BE IDENTIFIED AS THE PRIORITY 
19:31:30 MAPS MOVING FORWARD, BUT IF THEY ARE, I WOULD CERTAINLY FLAG THOSE CONCERNS.

19:31:38 SO OF THE NEW MAPS, THERE ARE TWO MAPS THAT DON'T MEET THAT BASIC CRITERIA, 
19:31:42 AND I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT WHY, BECAUSE IT'S A LOT OF -- IT'S REALLY 
19:31:43 DIFFICULT TO DRAW A MAP.

19:31:49 ANY OF YOU WHO HAVE SAT DOWN TO DO THIS, IT'S NOT JUST A  15-MINUTE 
19:31:50 ACTIVITY.

19:31:54 IT CAN BE QUITE COMPLICATED.

19:32:02 SO PUBLIC MAP 85560, IF YOU LOOK AT IT, IT LOOKS LIKE A VERY GOOD MAP.

19:32:08 AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE WEBSITE, IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S COMPLETE AND BALANCED.

19:32:14 HOWEVER, THIS MAP WAS CREATED BEFORE THE ONLINE MAPPING TOOL UPDATED WITH 
19:32:20 OUR OFFICIAL DATA FROM THE FEDERAL CENSUS AND THE CALIFORNIA ADJUSTMENT.

19:32:26 SO AFTER TAKING THIS MAP AND RUNNING IT THROUGH THE OFFICIAL CENSUS DATA, IT 
19:32:31 COMES OUT WITH A GREATER THAN 10% TOTAL  DEVIATION.

19:32:37 SO IT'S IMPORTANT, I THINK, FOR THE COUNCIL TO LOOK TO SEE THE THEMES AND 
19:32:40 THE IDEAS AND TO SEE WHERE THE LINES HAVE BEEN DRAWN.

19:32:45 BUT JUST TO BE AWARE THAT THAT MAP AS DRAWN DOESN'T MEET THE EQUAL 
19:32:46 POPULATION REQUIREMENT.

19:32:55 THEN THE OTHER MAP ON THIS  SLIDE, PUBLIC MAP 97723, IT'S NOT POPULATION 
19:32:59 BALANCED, BUT WHAT'S GOING ON HERE, AND I DON'T KNOW IF ANYONE NOTICED THIS 
19:33:01 YET, IT ONLY DRAWS FIVE DISTRICTS.

19:33:09 WE DON'T KNOW IF THAT WAS THE INTENT OF THE PERSON WHO DREW THE MAP OR NOT.

19:33:14 SOMETIMES THERE ARE MAPS WE RECEIVE THAT HAVE A DIFFERENT NUMBER OF 
19:33:19 DISTRICTS, THAN THE NUMBER OF DISTRICTS THAT THE CITY CURRENTLY HAS.

19:33:30 SO THAT MAP IS, TO SOME EXTENT, INCOMPLETE BECAUSE IT ALSO HAD 102 
19:33:35 PEOPLE UNASSIGNED, BUT IT CAN'T BE BALANCED BECAUSE IT DOES NOT DRAW SIX 
19:33:39 DISTRICTS, IT HAS ONE DISTRICT THAT IS -- EVEN WITH FIVE DISTRICTS, IT'S NOT 
19:33:40 BALANCED, RIGHT?

19:33:43 AND I DO SEE A HAND RAISED.

19:33:45 DID YOU WANT TO JUMP IN REAL QUICK?

19:33:47 >> Councilmember Kassan: YES.

19:33:52 I NOTICED THAT WHEN YOU'RE ON THE MAP PAGE, I DON'T ANYWHERE SEE THE NUMBER 
19:33:56 OF THE MAP ON THAT PAGE, AND SO I KEEP GOING BACK AND FORTH TRYING TO 
19:33:57 REMEMBER WHICH IS WHICH.

19:34:02 IS THERE ANYWHERE ON THE PAGE THAT INDICATES WHICH NUMBER IT IS?

19:34:04 >> THERE SHOULD BE.

19:34:12 SO IF YOU GO TO  REDISTRICTFREMONT.ORG, DRAFT MAPS.

19:34:15 >> Councilmember Kassan: IF YOU CLICK ON ONE OF THE MAPS, CAN YOU JUST SHOW 
19:34:20 ME WHERE THE  NUMBER IS ON THE MAP.

19:34:24 >> IF YOU CLICK THIS FIRST ONE, THE ONLY PLACE YOU CAN SEE THE MAP NUMBER 
19:34:25 IS ACTUALLY IN THE URL.

19:34:26 >> Councilmember Kassan: GOT IT.

19:34:28 >> AND THE URL IS IDENTICAL FOR ALL OF THESE MAPS.

19:34:31 THE ONLY THING THAT'S DIFFERENT IS THE MAP NUMBER.

19:34:32 >> Councilmember Kassan: GOT IT.

19:34:34 THANK YOU SO MUCH.

19:34:37 >> IN THE PDF, IT LISTS IT, BUT THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION.

19:34:40 I ALSO WANT TO LET EVERYONE KNOW, IF YOU SCROLL ALL THE WAY TO THE BOTTOM, 
19:34:46 THERE IS NOW THIS INTERACTIVE MAP WHERE YOU CAN KEEP THE EXISTING DISTRICT  
19:34:53 OUTLINES AND YOU CAN TURN ON AND OFF THE PUBLIC MAPS TO COMPARE THEM WITH 
19:34:56 THE CURRENT DISTRICTS, AND YOU CAN LOOK AT SOME OTHER DEMOGRAPHIC DATA AS 
19:34:56 WELL.

19:35:06 SO THIS IS A GREAT RESOURCE WHEN WE'RE TRYING TO COMPARE DIFFERENT DRAFT 
19:35:06 MAPS.

19:35:06 ALL RIGHT.

19:35:10 NOW TO GET INTO THE MAPS THAT ARE COMPLETE AND BALANCED, THAT ARE NEW 
19:35:20 SINCE THE LAST TIME THAT I WAS BEFORE YOU, WE HAVE PUBLIC MAP 85901.

19:35:25 THIS MAP HAS A TOTAL DEVIATION OF 7.05%.

19:35:33 AND YOU CAN SEE THAT THIS MAP REALLY DOESN'T MAKE ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES.

19:35:41 IF YOU LOOK AT THE BLACK DOTTED LINE, IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY -- TO DISTRICT 1.

19:35:44 THE DOTTED LINE IS THE CURRENT DISTRICT BOUNDARY, AND THEN OF COURSE THE 
19:35:49 SHADED AREAS ARE THE PROPOSED DISTRICT BOUNDARIES.

19:35:57 ONE OF THE THINGS WE TALKED ABOUT AT THE LAST PUBLIC HEARING WAS THE WAY 
19:36:02 THE CURRENT DISTRICT MAP, WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS SORT OF JAGGED LINE HERE, 
19:36:07 BETWEEN 2 AND 3, HOW IT DIVIDES THE GLENMOOR COMMUNITY.

19:36:13 SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE LOOK AT WHEN WE LOOK AT THESE MAPS IS, IS THE 
19:36:16 PROPOSAL  UNIFYING THAT NEIGHBORHOOD?

19:36:20 AND IS IT DIVIDING ANY OTHER NEIGHBORHOODS?

19:36:23 SO THAT'S ONE THING TO LOOK AT.

19:36:33 AND AS I MOVE TO THE NEXT MAP, I'LL ALSO POINT OUT THAT WHEN WE'RE LOOKING 
19:36:43 AT CITIZEN VOTING AGE POPULATION, WE DO SEE IN MOST OF THESE MAPS, IF NOT I 
19:36:48 BELIEVE ALL OF THEM, WE DO SEE THAT THREE OUT OF THE SIX DISTRICTS DO HAVE 
19:36:53 A MAJORITY ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDER OF CITIZENS OF VOTING AGE.

19:36:55 SO THAT'S WORTH POINTING OUT.

19:37:08 PUBLIC MAP 91064 HAS A SLIGHTLY LOWER DEVIATION, 6.43%, AND AGAIN, YOU CAN 
19:37:16 SEE THIS MAP UNIFIES GLENMOOR TO A BETTER EXTENT THAN THE CURRENT MAP AND 
19:37:25 MAKES, AGAIN, VERY LITTLE CHANGES TO THE CURRENT  DISTRICT 1 AND THE 
19:37:26 CURRENT DISTRICT 5.

19:37:33 THERE IS A CHUNK OF 5 THAT HAS BEEN ADDED INTO DISTRICT 6.

19:37:43 THERE IS SOME OF DISTRICT 6 THAT HAS BEEN ADDED INTO DISTRICT 4, AND IN 
19:37:54 GENERAL, THIS MAP AND THE PREVIOUS MAP, BUT MORE SO THIS MAP, 91064, IS REALLY 
19:37:56 SORT OF MINIMAL CHANGES TO THE CURRENT MAP.

19:38:11 95649, THIS MAP HAS A TOTAL DEVIATION OF 7.81%, AND AGAIN, THIS MAP UNIFIES 
19:38:15 GLENMOOR BUT YOU'LL NOTICE WHAT'S DIFFERENT ABOUT THIS ONE THAN THE TWO 
19:38:21 OTHERS IS THAT THIS MAP ASSIGNS THE GLENMOOR AREA TO  DISTRICT 2 AS 
19:38:24 OPPOSED TO DISTRICT 3.

19:38:31 AND THIS MAP ATTEMPTS TO DEAL WITH THE UNDERPOPULATION OF DISTRICT 1 BY 
19:38:40 EXTENDING IT INTO WHAT IS CURRENTLY DISTRICT 2, SO THAT'S WHY YOU SEE SOME 
19:38:44 OF THAT SORT OF RED/PINK AREA THERE.

19:38:46 BECAUSE THE CURRENT  DISTRICT 1 IS UNDERPOPULATED.

19:38:48 SO THEY'RE TRYING TO BALANCE THAT THERE.

19:38:56 WE DO HAVE A SORT OF -- IF YOU LOOK CLOSELY AT DISTRICT 3, THERE IS A 
19:38:59 WEIRD LITTLE FOOT OR TAIL POKING INTO DISTRICT 6.

19:39:06 I'M NOT SURE IF THERE'S A SPECIFIC REASON FOR THAT OR NOT.

19:39:17 BUT THIS DISTRICT 6 IS IN SOME WAYS NOT COMPACT BECAUSE YOU SEE IT REALLY 
19:39:22 CIRCLING AROUND INTO THAT MISSION AREA.

19:39:28 DISTRICT 5 IS RELATIVELY THE SAME AND UNCHANGED.

19:39:35 BUT WE DEFINITELY SEE WHAT IS CURRENTLY DISTRICT 4 BEING BROKEN UP UNDER THIS 
19:39:35 PROPOSAL.

19:39:41 AND WHILE I'M JUST TRYING TO GET YOU THE BROAD STROKES HERE, I WILL TAKE 
19:39:47 QUESTIONS AND I CAN PULL UP THAT INTERACTIVE MAP AT THE END SO THAT WE 
19:39:52 CAN ZOOM IN TO HELP ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT THE COUNCIL MAY HAVE.

19:40:06 SO NDC DRAFTED MAPS ALSO TRYING TO UNIFY GLENMOOR BUT ALSO TO SOME EXTENT 
19:40:10 MAKE MINIMAL CHANGES TO BALANCE THE POPULATION.

19:40:16 SO THE PURPLE MAP, AND AGAIN, THESE ARE RANDOM NAMES, WE'RE GIVING THE MAPS, 
19:40:20 HAVE A TOTAL DEVIATION OF 8.14%.

19:40:29 AND YOU CAN SEE THAT IT PRETTY CLOSELY ALIGNS WITH THE CURRENT DISTRICT, YOU 
19:40:35  DO SEE  DISTRICT 5 HERE, THERE'S A CHUNK OF DISTRICT 6 THAT HAS BECOME 
19:40:39 DISTRICT 5 BETWEEN RAILROAD TRACKS AND 680 THERE.

19:40:49 YOU DO SEE A LITTLE BIT OF CURRENT DISTRICT 4 THAT IS GETTING ADDED INTO 
19:40:53 3 AND SOME OF CURRENT DISTRICT 2 THAT'S ALSO GETTING ADDED INTO 3, AND AGAIN, 
19:40:56 STRAIGHTENING THAT JAGGED LINE IN BETWEEN.

19:40:59 KEEPING DISTRICT 1 UNCHANGED.

19:41:10 THE NDC GREEN MAP HAS A SLIGHTLY LOWER DEVIATION OF 6.7%.

19:41:12 AGAIN DISTRICT 1 IS UNCHANGED.

19:41:18 IT IS GOING TO BE THE LEAST POPULATED DISTRICT.

19:41:23 REALLY THE ONLY WAY TO INCREASE THE POPULATION OF DISTRICT 1 IS TO PUSH IT 
19:41:24 INTO DISTRICT 2.

19:41:32 THE PURPLE AND THE GREEN MAP INSTEAD JUST KEEP DISTRICT 1 AS IS.

19:41:37 THIS ONE, YOU'LL SEE INCORPORATES GLENMOOR INTO DISTRICT 3 INSTEAD OF 
19:41:41  DISTRICT 2, SO THAT IS ONE OF THE QUESTIONS TO THINK ABOUT, IS WHERE 
19:41:44 DOES THIS NEIGHBORHOOD MAKE THE MOST SENSE.

19:41:53 AND AGAIN, THIS ONE PRESERVES DISTRICT 5 AS WELL INTACT, AND THERE'S SOME 
19:42:00 CHANGES ON THE BORDERS OF DISTRICT 4 WITH SOME OF CURRENT DISTRICT 3 POKING 
19:42:05 UP ALMOST LIKE A FISHTAIL INTO 4 THERE, AND A LITTLE BIT OF DISTRICT 2 AS 
19:42:05 WELL.

19:42:17 THAT IS IN ORDER TO GET OUR POPULATION BALANCED HERE BUT ALSO MAKING MINIMAL 
19:42:22 CHANGES, YOU CAN ALSO SEE THERE IS JUST THE SMALL PART OF DISTRICT 6 THAT HAS 
19:42:30 BEEN INCORPORATED FOLLOWING, AGAIN, RAILROAD TRACKS AS A BOUNDARY BETWEEN 
19:42:31 6 AND 4.

19:42:35 SO I CAN GO OVER TO THE WEBSITE NOW.

19:42:39 HERE'S THE EMAIL FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC THAT ALREADY WANT TO GIVE 
19:42:44 FEEDBACK ON THESE MAPS, AND THEN I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS.

19:42:47 THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR LISTENING.

19:42:51 I KNOW THAT WAS A LONG PRESENTATION, I WAS TRYING TO GO NOT TOO FAST FOR OUR 
19:42:52  INTERPRETERS.

19:42:55 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:43:00 I SEE A HAND RAISED BY --

19:43:02 >> EXCUSE ME, MADAME MAYOR, BEFORE WE GO TO MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC OR OTHER 
19:43:07 QUESTIONS, I JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY, AGAIN, THAT OUR REDISTRICTING SCHEDULE 
19:43:13 HAS BEEN UPDATED WHERE REDISTRICTING PUBLIC HEARING NUMBER 4 IS MARCH 1ST.

19:43:17 I THINK KRISTEN MIGHT HAVE HAD IT LISTED AS APRIL 15TH.

19:43:18 >> OH, I'M SO SORRY.

19:43:19 >> IT'S OKAY.

19:43:24 REITERATING THAT THAT SCHEDULE HAS BEEN UPDATED ON THE CITY'S WEBSITE, BOTH 
19:43:28 THE CITY'S MAIN WEBSITE AND REDISTRICTING WEBSITE.

19:43:32 SO JUST HIGHLIGHTING THAT FOR THE PUBLIC, AND THE CITY WILL BE PUTTING 
19:43:34 OUT OUTREACH WITH THE MARCH 1ST DATE.

19:43:39 ONE MORE HIGHLIGHT I WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT THAT DEBRA MARGOLIS AND 
19:43:47 TRICIA ORTIZ ARE ALSO ON TONIGHT'S ZOOM OR CITY COUNCIL MEETING TO PROVIDE ANY 
19:43:50 LEGAL COUNCIL THAT THE CITY OR CITY COUNCIL MAY NEED.

19:43:50 THANK YOU.

19:43:54 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:43:56 I NOTED THAT TOO WHEN I WAS LOOKING AT IT.

19:43:57 SO THANK YOU.

19:44:03 I SEE COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN HAS HER HAND RAISED, BECAUSE AT THIS TIME, WE'LL GO 
19:44:05 TO THE COUNCILMEMBERS FOR CLARIFYING QUESTIONS.

19:44:14 >> Councilmember Kassan: THANK YOUMENT I'M FEELING REALLY SAD FOR 
19:44:17 CENTERVILLE, OUR MAIN STREET RIGHT NOW, BECAUSE I'M NOT  SEEING A LOT OF MAPS 
19:44:21 THAT DON'T DIVIDE IT INTO TWO HALVES.

19:44:30 AND OF COURSE AT OUR MEETING LAST WEEK, WEES ALSO DID SOMETHING I THINK IS 
19:44:31 REALLY BAD FOR THAT STREET.

19:44:35 BUT IT'S ONE OF THE FEW STREETS IN OUR CITY THAT HAS A POTENTIAL TO BE A 
19:44:36 WALKABLE MAIN STREET AND A COMMUNITY.

19:44:44 UNLIKE MOWRY, WHICH IS SO WIDE AND SUCH A HIGHLY TRAFFICKED STREET WHERE IT 
19:44:51 MAKES SENSE TO DIVIDE INTO TWO SEPARATE AREAS, CENTERVILLE IS A MAIN STREET 
19:44:53 COMMUNITY WITH BUSINESSES AND RESIDENTS ON BOTH SIDES.

19:44:59 SO WE HAD MENTIONED THAT THAT WAS IMPORTANT TO US BEFORE, AND SO I'M 
19:45:02 REALLY SURPRISED TO SEE THAT THAT WASN'T RESPECTED IN THESE MAPS.

19:45:08 SO I'M JUST CURIOUS WHY THAT MIGHT BE.

19:45:11 AND THERE WERE SOME PUBLICLY SUBMITTED MAPS, WHICH I CAN GIVE YOU THE ONES 
19:45:15 THAT LOOKED LIKE THEY DID RESPECT THAT, BUT IN TERMS OF THE  
19:45:17 CONSULTANT-SUBMITTED MAPS, I DON'T SEE ANY OF THEM THAT TOOK THAT TO HEART.

19:45:26 >> WHICH ARE THE PUBLIC MAPS THAT YOU THINK DO A BETTER JOB OF CENTERVILLE?

19:45:31 AND I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT TO MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC, CONSULTANT MAPS ARE NOT 
19:45:32 NECESSARILY BETTER MAPS.

19:45:35 MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC KNOW THE NEIGHBORHOODS AND THE COMMUNITIES 
19:45:35 BETTER.

19:45:42 AND WHAT I'M HERE AS YOUR CONSULTANT THAT I CAN DO IS HELP MAKE ANY 
19:45:49 REVISIONS TO PUBLIC  MAPS TOO, TO GET THOSE IN ANY WAY TO THE IDEAL POINT.

19:45:52 SO YOU'RE NOT HURTING MY FEELINGS, DON'T WORRY.

19:45:53 >> Councilmember Kassan: OKAY.

19:45:57 SO THE ONES I SAW -- AND I WAS HAVING A LITTLE TROUBLE BECAUSE I COULDN'T -- 
19:46:00 EVERY TIME I  LOOKED, I COULDN'T SEE WHICH NUMBER IT WAS, BUT I'M PRETTY 
19:46:03 SURE THE ONES THAT LOOKED LIKE THEY REALLY DID A DECENT JOB, AND OF COURSE 
19:46:07 I WAS ONLY LOOKING AT THAT PART OF THE MAP SO I'M NOT SURE IF OTHER PARTS 
19:46:17 MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN AS GOOD, BUT 80170, 86345, AND 95649 LOOKED LIKE THEY ALL 
19:46:24 DID A PRETTY GOOD JOB OF TREATING CENTERVILLE AND GLENMOOR ALSO AS 
19:46:25 COMMUNITIES THAT NEED TO BE KEPT TOGETHER.

19:46:29 >> EXCELLENT.

19:46:39 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:46:40 CLARIFYING QUESTIONS?

19:46:41 COUNCILMEMBER JONES.

19:46:43 >> Councilmember Jones: THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR.

19:46:47 I AGREE WITH COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN.

19:46:51 THERE WAS THAT CONVERSATION THAT WE HAD ABOUT CENTERVILLE AND INCORPORATING 
19:46:53 ALL THE BUSINESSES INTO ONE DISTRICT.

19:47:04 I, TOO, AM KIND OF IN FAVOR -- WELL, I WAS IN FAVOR OF TWO, BUT I CAN'T FIND 
19:47:06 WHAT HAPPENED TO THE NDC MINIMAL CHANGE MAP.

19:47:08 WAS THAT SOMETHING THAT WASN'T PRESENT PRESENTED?

19:47:12  PRESENTED?

19:47:14 >> SORRY, I WAS MUTED.

19:47:18 SO THAT WAS PRESENTED -- I BELIEVE THAT WAS PRESENTED AT THE PREVIOUS 
19:47:18 MEETING.

19:47:21 SO WHAT I WAS DOING WAS PRESENTING WHAT WAS NEW THIS EVENING.

19:47:26 BUT IF YOU WANT, I CAN GO AHEAD AND PULL THAT UP ON THE SCREEN OR IF YOU 
19:47:29 JUST HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT IT, I'M HAPPY TO TRY TO ANSWER IT.

19:47:33 >> Councilmember Jones: WELL, I WAS JUST CURIOUS IF THAT'S STILL ONE OF 
19:47:37 THE OPTIONS, IF IT WAS INCLUDED IN THE VIABLE MAPS.

19:47:41 >> YES, INDEED.

19:47:43 >> Councilmember Jones: IT IS?

19:47:48 >> City Mgr. Shackelford: WHY DON'T YOU PULL IT UP SO EVERYONE CAN SEE IT.

19:47:52 I WAS ASKING KRISTEN TO PULL IT UP SO EVERYONE CAN SEE IT.

19:47:54 >> GIVE ME JUST --

19:47:56 >> Councilmember Jones: I'M SORRY, I THINK THAT ADDRESSED WHAT 
19:47:57 COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN WAS JUST REFERENCING AS WELL.

19:48:04 >> Councilmember Kassan:ACTUALL Y IT REALLY DOESN'T, AND TO ME THAT'S THE 
19:48:08 WORST MAP OF ALL BECAUSE IT DOESN'T GET RID OF THAT STRANGE JAGGED LINE, AND 
19:48:13 IT CONTINUES TO DIVIDE FREMONT BOULEVARD INTO TWO SEPARATE DISTRICT 
19:48:14 ON EITHER SIDE.

19:48:19 SO I'M NOT -- YOU MIGHT BE THINKING OF A DIFFERENT ONE, BUT THAT ONE DOES NOT 
19:48:20 RESOLVE IT.

19:48:24 >> Councilmember Jones: YEAH, AGAIN, MINE, LIKE YOURS, THEY DON'T SHOW 
19:48:31 WHICH MAP I'M LOOKING AT, BUT I THOUGHT THAT THE MINIMAL CHANGE MAP, IF I GO 
19:48:43 BACK AND RELOAD IT, DID TAKE INTO ACCOUNT MOWRY AND THIS IS THE ONLY ONE 
19:48:46 THAT DOESN'T HAVE STREET NAMES ATTACHED TO IT.

19:48:47 >> I KNOW!

19:48:54 >> Councilmember Jones: OH, NO, IT DOES NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT MOWRY, WHICH I 
19:48:56 AGREE SHOULD BE INCORPORATED.

19:49:01 BUT IT DOES TAKE INTO ACCOUNT, IT LOOKS LIKE, BOTH SIDES OF FREMONT BOULEVARD, 
19:49:03 PARTICULARLY THROUGH THE CENTERVILLE BUSINESS DISTRICT.

19:49:07 AGAIN, IT'S KIND OF HARD TO TELL BECAUSE THERE ARE NO STREET NAMES 
19:49:08 ATTACHED.

19:49:10 SO I'M JUST GOING BY LANDMARKS.

19:49:14 >> SO I HAVE IT UP ON THE SCREEN HERE.

19:49:20 I THINK WHEN WE PRESENTED THIS PREVIOUSLY, THE MAIN CONCERN WAS THAT 
19:49:27 IT SAID THAT IT DIDN'T FIX THE JAGGED EDGE, AND ALSO THERE WAS FEEDBACK THAT 
19:49:34 THE ADDITION TO DISTRICT 1 WAS NOT LOGICAL, AND THAT IS BECAUSE DISTRICT 
19:49:37 1, AGAIN, IS VERY UNDER POPULATED CURRENTLY.

19:49:44 BUT IF YOU GO BACK TO THAT PREVIOUS POWERPOINT, FOR SOME REASON THIS ISN'T 
19:49:48 ON THE INTERACTIVE MAP SO I'LL HAVE TO MAKE SURE THIS GETS BACK ON THE 
19:49:51 INTERACTIVE MAP OR JUST TURNED BACK ON, BUT THE PREVIOUS POWERPOINT DOES HAVE 
19:49:56 SOME  ZOOM-IN WITH STREET NAMES, BUT YOU'RE RIGHT, IT DOESN'T HAVE STREET 
19:49:57 NAMES AND IT SHOULD.

19:50:03 >> Councilmember Kassan: IF YOU LOOK AT THE LEFT-MOST PART OF THE GREEN, THAT 
19:50:10 LITTLE BULGE STICKING OUT, THAT HAS ONE SIDE IN GREEN AND THE OTHER SIDE IS IN 
19:50:12 BLUE, AND THAT'S FREMONT BOULEVARD, I'M PRETTY SURE.

19:50:20 SO IT DOES HAVE -- FLEEMENT BOULEVARD HAS BLUE ON ONE SIDE, GREEN ON THE 
19:50:20 OTHER.

19:50:22 >> Councilmember Jones: ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT THE MINIMAL CHANGE MAP?

19:50:24 >> Councilmember Kassan: YEAH, THE ONE THAT'S UP ON THE SCREEN RIGHT NOW.

19:50:34 >> THAT LITTLE BULGE THAT GOES THE LARGEST TO THE LEFT?

19:50:36 >> Councilmember Kassan: THAT DIVIDES FREMONT INTO TWO SIDES.

19:50:39 >> Councilmember Jones: THE BULGE FROM DISTRICT 3, CORRECT, IS WHAT YOU'RE 
19:50:40 REFERENCING?

19:50:44 >> Councilmember Kassan: THE BULGE -- IF YOU GO UP -- PUT YOUR CURSOR UP A 
19:50:47 LITTLE BIT, THAT BULGE THAT GOES FARTHEST TO THE LEFT.

19:50:48 YEAH.

19:50:54 THAT BULGE DIVIDE FREMONT BOULEVARD INTO TWO SIDE THAT ARE IN TWO 
19:50:54 DIFFERENT DISTRICTS.

19:51:04 THE SOUTHERN SIDE OF FREMONT IS BLUE AND THE NORTHERN SIDE IS GREEN.

19:51:12 WHICH I BELIEVE IS -- IT'S THE WAY IT IS NOW, IT'S EXACTLY THE WAY IT IS NOW.

19:51:14 WHICH IS THE THING THAT WE'RE TRYING TO FIX.

19:51:22 >> Councilmember Jones: AGAIN, I KNOW WE WANT TO FIX THE LINE ON MOWRY, AND 
19:51:25 I CAN DISCUSS WHAT I'VE HEARD FROM SOME OF THE RESIDENTS A LITTLE BIT LATER ON 
19:51:30 AFTER QUESTIONS ARE ALL DONE, BUT -- OKAY.

19:51:33 OF ALL THE MAPS ON HERE, THIS IS THE ONLY ONE THAT DEPARTMENT HAVE STREET 
19:51:39  DIDN'T HAVE STREET NAMES ATTACHED TO IT SO IT WAS A LITTLE MORE DIFFICULT 
19:51:40 TO DECIPHER.

19:51:43 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:51:45 I THINK THAT'S ALL THE  CLARIFYING QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME.

19:51:51 I'M ALSO GOING TO NOW OPEN THE PUBLIC HEARING, AND MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC 
19:51:57 WISHING TO SPEAK MAY DO SO BY CLICKING ON THE RAISE HAND ICON OR BY -- IF 
19:51:59 YOU'RE CALLING IN, BY DIALING  STAR NINE.

19:52:05 THIS INCLUDES THOSE WHO ARE TUNED IN VIA ZOOM TO THE MANDARIN OR CANTONESE 
19:52:08 LANGUAGE CHANNELS WHO WISH TO COMMENT ON THE REDISTRICTING PROCESS.

19:52:19 OKAY.

19:52:26 WE'LL BEGIN WITH KELLY ABREU.

19:52:27 WELCOME.

19:52:35 >> YEAH, I'D LIKE TO POINT TO SOME OF THE STREET NAMES ON THE MAPS, SO I'LL 
19:52:38 START WITH THE GREEN MAP, WHICH IS MY FAVORITE MAP, BY THE WAY.

19:52:42 THERE IS SOMETHING CALLED JARVIS AVENUE.

19:52:47 I DID A VERY CAREFUL STUDY OF JARVIS AVENUE ON GOOGLE MAPS AND I 
19:52:51 DETERMINED, BASED ON A SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATION HERE IN GOOGLE, THAT 
19:52:53 JARVIS AVENUE IS NOT IN FREMONT.

19:52:56 IT'S ENTIRELY WITHIN THE CITY OF NEWARK.

19:52:59 SO THAT'S PROBABLY AN INCORRECT STREET NAME.

19:53:01 NOW WHY IS THE GREEN MAP SO  GOOD?

19:53:08 WELL, YOU KNOW, IT KEEPS DISTRICT 3 FAIRLY COMPACT, DISTRICT 2 FAIRLY 
19:53:14 COMPACT, IT FIXES THE JAGGED LINE, IT KEEPS DISTRICT 6 PRETTY WELL TOGETHER.

19:53:20 AS OPPOSED TO THE PURPLE MAP, WHICH TAKES DISTRICT 3 AND SNAKES IT ALL 
19:53:26 AROUND AND  COMBINES QUARRY LAKES WITH SOMEWHERE DOWN AROUND STEVENSON AND 880.

19:53:29 SO THAT'S A LITTLE BIT STRANGE.

19:53:32 THE GREEN MAP LOOKS PERFECTLY FINE.

19:53:37 WE AT LEAST GET RID OF THOSE  JAGGED LINES THAT SEPARATE DISTRICT 2 AND 3.

19:53:38 THANK YOU.

19:53:42 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:53:44 NEXT SPEAKER IS KATHY KIMBERLIN.

19:53:44 WELCOME.

19:53:49 >> GOOD EVENING.

19:53:51 KATHY KIMBERLIN HERE.

19:53:56 I AM A GLENMOOR RESIDENT, AND ALSO THE PRESIDENT OF THE CENTERVILLE BUSINESS 
19:53:56 AND COMMUNITY ASSOCIATION.

19:54:06 I WILL PUT A DISCLAIMER, I DO NOT THINK THIS REDISTRICTING EVOLVES AROUND ME, 
19:54:07 REVOLVES AROUND MY NEIGHBORHOOD.

19:54:13 HOWEVER, I DO HAPPEN TO REPRESENT TWO VERY PROMINENT AREAS THAT REALLY WOULD 
19:54:14 BENEFIT TO STAY CONNECTED.

19:54:19 CENTERVILLE STAYING CONNECTED AND STAYING WHOLE WOULD BE VERY IMPORTANT, 
19:54:20 AS WELL AS GLENMOOR.

19:54:25 GLENMOOR IS ALREADY SPLIT UP WITH SCHOOL DISTRICTING, AND I'D LIKE TO 
19:54:28 SEE THINGS A LITTLE SMOOTHER FOR THE COMMUNITY.

19:54:34 HOWEVER, THAT AFFECTS OUR NEIGHBORING DISTRICTS, WOULD LOVE TO WORK WITH 
19:54:35 THEM, WOULD LOVE TO WORK WITH THAT.

19:54:39 I DON'T WANT TO SHORTCHANGE ANYONE ELSE, BUT OF COURSE MY INTEREST 
19:54:43 TONIGHT WOULD REALLY BE TO POINT OUT GLENMOOR AND CENTERVILLE CONNECTIVITY.

19:54:44 AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

19:54:47 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:54:52 THE NEXT SPEAKER IS JOHN HINDS.

19:54:53 WELCOME.

19:54:54 >> HELLO, EVERYONE.

19:54:59 FIRST I WANT TO SAY IT WAS A VERY INFORMATIVE, VERY HELPFUL PRESENTATION.

19:55:06 BUT AS WE HEARD IT, IT'S HARD NOT TO NOTICE HOW MUCH WORK IT TOOK TO 
19:55:10 PREPARE THAT AND HOW MUCH WORK IT TAKING THE COUNCIL AND OTHERS TO 
19:55:11 REVIEW IT AND ACT ON IT.

19:55:16 SO I HAVE TO ASK, WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME THE CITY ATTORNEY WAS ASKED TO 
19:55:21 GIVE AN OPINION ON HOW MUCH TIME WOULD HAVE TO ELAPSE OR WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES 
19:55:25 WOULD HAVE TO CHANGE BEFORE WE COULD JUST GO BACK TO AT-LARGE COUNCIL 
19:55:26 ELECTIONS?

19:55:31 ASIDE FROM ALL THE EXTRA  COMPLEXITY IN THIS, THE MAIN EFFECT OF IT IS TO 
19:55:36 DILUTE THE VOTES OF EVERYONE IN FREMONT BECAUSE EACH OF US DIRECTLY AFFECTS 
19:55:38 ONLY ONE OUT OF THE SIX COUNCIL SEATS.

19:55:43 I KNOW THIS WASN'T DONE FOR THE SAKE OF BENEFITS, BUT THERE DON'T APPEAR TO BE 
19:55:44 MANY  BENEFITS.

19:55:49 SO I DO HOPE YOU'LL LOOK INTO HOW SOON WE COULD END THIS AND GO BACK TO 
19:55:49 AT-LARGE.

19:55:50 THANK YOU.

19:55:52 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:56:01 I'M LOOKING THROUGH THE PUBLIC, AND I SEE NO OTHER HANDS BEING RAISED.

19:56:11 AT THIS TIME, I WILL CLOSE THE PUBLIC HEARING AND THEN BRING IT BACK TO THE 
19:56:12 COMMENTS FROM THE COUNCIL.

19:56:16 I SEE COUNCILMEMBER JONES.

19:56:23 >> Councilmember Jones: OKAY.

19:56:27 I GUESS MY HAND IS STILL UP FROM LAST TIME BUT I'LL MAKE SOME COMMENTS.

19:56:31 REGARDING THE MINIMAL CHANGE  MAP, I DO UNDERSTAND THE  CONCERNS THERE.

19:56:38 ONE THING THAT IT LOOKS LIKE IS IF STRAIGHTENING OUT THE LINE, I'M 
19:56:43 WONDERING IF YOU EXTENDED THAT ALL THE WAY DOWN TO PASEO PADRE, IT TAKES CARE 
19:56:47 OF THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN 2 AND 3 THERE, BUT IT ALSO INCORPORATES BOTH 
19:56:52 SIDES OF FREMONT BOULEVARD INTO THE SAME DISTRICT.

19:56:53 SO THAT WOULD BE A PLUS.

19:56:58 PLUS I'VE HEARD FROM A NUMBER OF RESIDENTS, AND I KNOW IT DOESN'T 
19:57:02 MATTER POPULATION-WISE, BUT A NUMBER OF RESIDENTS IN THE GLENMOOR NEIGHBORHOOD 
19:57:06 HAVE EXPRESSED AN INTEREST TO HAVE WASHINGTON HIGH SCHOOL INCLUDE IN THAT 
19:57:07 DISTRICT.

19:57:12 SO AGAIN, ALL OF THAT EXTENDING THAT LINE EAST ON MOWRY TO PASEO PADRE AN 
19:57:17  AND THEN NORTH, I THINK WOULD PROBABLY CORRECT THAT.

19:57:22 EVERYTHING ELSE, AGAIN, WITH THE EXCEPTION, AND I BELIEVE THE 
19:57:28 CONSULTANT MENTIONED THIS, THERE'S THAT NON-CONTIGUOUS PORTION OF DISTRICT 1 
19:57:32 THAT GOES INTO THE QUARRY LAKES ISHERWOOD AREA.

19:57:37 I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT WOULD DO TO SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGE THE POPULATION, 
19:57:42 BUT IT REALLY KIND OF AN OUTLIAR, SO I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT WOULD BE 
19:57:46 SOMETHING THAT WE'D WANT TO GO FORWARD WITH EITHER.

19:57:51 BUT THOSE ARE BASICALLY ALL THE COMMENTS I HAVE ON THOSE -- ON 
19:57:53 DIRECTION FOR THIS PARTICULAR MAP.

19:58:01 IT SEEMS TO BE PRETTY WELL BALANCED, AND IT DOES STRAIGHTEN OUT WHAT WE'VE 
19:58:06 DISCUSSED IN OUR DECEMBER 7TH MEETING, I BELIEVE IT WAS, AND ALSO ADDRESSES 
19:58:08 FREMONT BOULEVARD IF I'M READING THE MAP CORRECTLY.

19:58:08 THANK YOU.

19:58:11 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:58:16 AND I'D LIKE TO TURN IT TO COUNCILMEMBER SHAO FOR COMMENTS.

19:58:19 >> Councilmember Shao: THANK  YOU, MADAME MAYOR.

19:58:30 I WOULD LIKE TO DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO MAP FROM PUBLIC, NUMBER 91064, WHERE 
19:58:41 THE BIGGEST CHANGE WOULD BE TO PUT NILES INTO DISTRICT 2.

19:58:50 NILES, AS MUCH AS I REALLY APPRECIATE THE NEIGHBORHOOD WITH THE LONGEST 
19:58:59 HISTORY IN FREMONT, FROM THE SCHOOL ATTENDING POINT OF VIEW, IT DOES GO TO 
19:59:07 THE WASHINGTON AREA, AND ON THE OTHER HAND -- SO IN THIS CASE, WHEN NILES IS 
19:59:15 PUT INTO  DISTRICT 2, IT CERTAINLY WOULD MAKE SENSE FOR THE PARENTS AND 
19:59:25 THE STUDENTS WHO WOULD GO TO THE SAME ATTENDING AREA, AS FOR THE MISSION SAN 
19:59:29 JOSÉ NEIGHBORHOOD, I SEE PART OF THE GOMES AREA IS RIGHT NOW BACK TO 
19:59:36 DISTRICT 4, AND THAT CERTAINLY IS A CORRECTION FROM THE PAST WHERE PART OF 
19:59:41 MISSION SAN JOSÉ WAS INTO DISTRICT 6.

19:59:54 IN TERMS OF POPULATION BALANCE, IT IS PROBABLY THE MOST WELL BALANCED, AN IT 
20:00:00 IS COMPACT IN TERMS OF EACH DISTRICT AND IT CON SERVES THE COMPLETENESS OF 
20:00:04 THE COMMUNITY OF INTEREST.

20:00:09 SO I JUST WANT TO SHOW MY SUPPORT TO THIS MAP.

20:00:10 THANK YOU.

20:00:16 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

20:00:20 I'M CHECKING TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY OTHER COUNCILMEMBERS THAT WOULD LIKE 
20:00:22 TO MAKE COMMENTS.

20:00:29 WE WILL BE HAVING ANOTHER HEARING AS MENTIONED IN THE CORRECTED SCHEDULE AS 
20:00:35 MARCH 1ST, WE'VE CORRECTED THAT.

20:00:36 COUNCILMEMBER COX.

20:00:37 >> Councilmember Cox: YES.

20:00:42 THANK YOU SO MUCH TO DNC FOR THE PRESENTATION.

20:00:50 I'M LOOKING AT ONE OF THE MAPS, THIS WAS THE GREEN MAP, AND IT LOOKS LIKE 
20:00:56 IT TOOK THE STREET IN DISTRICT 6 ALL THE WAY FROM AUTOMALL PARKWAY ALL THE 
20:01:04 WAY TO 680, WHICH WOULD ENCOMPASS SOME OF THE MISSION SAN JOSÉ AREA, AND 
20:01:14 DISTRICT 6 IS PREDOMINANTLY IRVINGTON, AND THIS PART OF COVERING THAT PART 
20:01:18 PLUS IS THAT INCLUDING THE RAILROADS ON THAT SIDE?

20:01:22 >> ARE WE TALKING ABOUT GREEN?

20:01:23 >> Councilmember Cox: THE GREEN MAP.

20:01:29 GREEN MAP, DISTRICT 6, AND WHEN YOU TAKE ALL THE WAY TO THE FREEWAY, 
20:01:30 YOU'RE ALSO  INCLUDING --

20:01:32 >> THAT'S CORRECT, YEAH, THE RAILROAD AREA.

20:01:34 >> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.

20:01:43 WHICH IS NOT REALLY INHIBITED A AT ALL, IN SOME PARTS OF THAT, BUT IT DOES 
20:01:44 OVERLAP IN SOME OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICT.

20:01:54 THAT WOULD BE THAT CUTOUT PAST DRISCOLL RIGHT THERE, DRISCOLL AND -- I GUESS 
20:01:59 THAT WOULD BE -- ANOTHER MAP I SAW IT WAS WASHINGTON BOULEVARD, WHICH IS 
20:02:00 MORE ON THE MISSION SIDE.

20:02:15 >> AND ARE YOU SAYING THAT THIS AREA, ADDING IT INTO 4, DOESN'T MAKE SENSE 
20:02:15 TO YOU?

20:02:17 >> Councilmember Cox: NOT  REALLY.

20:02:19 >> OKAY.

20:02:21 >> Councilmember Cox: NOT ENTIRELY.

20:02:25 JUST TRYING TO KEEP THE ONE DISTRICT TOGETHER.

20:02:32 AND I KNOW WE ALL LOVE EACH OTHER IN THE DIFFERENT  DISTRICT -- MISSION AND 
20:02:40 IRVINGTON, BUT I KNOW THAT PART OF THE IRVINGTON HISTORY AND MAKING SURE 
20:02:46  THAT STILL MAINTAINS ITS PRESENCE AND ITS HISTORY THERE, AND NOT TO BE KIND 
20:02:47 OF COMINGLED.

20:02:51 WHAT WAS THE OTHER ONE?

20:03:00 I WAS LOOKING AT -- I THINK I WAS LOOKING AT YOUR PURPLE MAP.

20:03:13 YEAH, ON THE PURPLE MAP, YOU HAVE IT THAT DISTRICT 6, I  GUESS, MOVES UP A 
20:03:16 LITTLE BIT MORE INTO DISTRICT 4.

20:03:23 >> YEAH, IT RETURNS IT BACK TO WHERE THE CURRENT LINE IS.

20:03:26 >> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.

20:03:31 SO THIS THE CURRENT LINE WITH THE DRISCOLL AND I'M NOT SURE WHAT THAT 
20:03:32 OTHER STREET IS.

20:03:35 IS THAT STILL DRISCOLL GOING DOWN TO AUTOMALL?

20:03:39 >> IT'S OSGOOD -- WELL, IT'S REALLY THE RAILROAD TRACKS, I GUESS.

20:03:41 >> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.

20:03:46 >> IS WHAT THAT LINE IS  FOLLOWING BETWEEN 6 AND 5.

20:03:47 >> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.

20:03:57 YEAH, THAT WOULD BE KIND OF SIMILAR TO WHAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW, IN THE CURRENT 
20:03:58 MAP,  CORRECT.

20:04:01 >> RIGHT.

20:04:07 AND KEEPING IN MIND THAT CURRENTLY DISTRICT 6 IS THE MOST OVERPOPULATED 
20:04:14 DISTRICT, SO WHEN WE'RE THINKING OF WHICH PART OF IT YOU MAY WANT TO SHIFT 
20:04:19 WITH OTHER DISTRICTS, IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO THINK WHAT IS LOGICAL THERE 
20:04:23 AND NOT DIVIDING  IRVINGTON.

20:04:25 >> Councilmember Cox: RIGHT.

20:04:32 I WANT TO KEEP IRVINGTON WHOLE, AND WE'LL TALK SOME MORE.

20:04:36 I'M STILL LOOKING AT A COUPLE OTHER MAPS AND KIND OF COMPARING RIGHT NOW.

20:04:37 >> GOOD.

20:04:37 THANK YOU.

20:04:44 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

20:04:48 SEEING NONE, OH, NEVER MIND.

20:04:51 I NOW SEE COUNCILMEMBER KENG HAS RAISED HER HAND.

20:04:53 COUNCILMEMBER KENG.

20:04:54 >> Councilmember Keng: YES, THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR.

20:04:56 THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION.

20:05:03 I THINK THAT WE DEFINITELY WANT TO KEEP OUR NEIGHBORHOODS TOGETHER, SO WE CAN 
20:05:07 CORRECT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WENT THROUGH DURING THE FIRST 
20:05:14 REDISTRICTING, AND THEN I'M MOST FAVORING THE  NDC GREEN MAP.

20:05:19 I THINK IT KIND OF KEEPS THE -- I THINK KIND OF LIKE THE SQUARE SIZES, IT 
20:05:23 KEEPS THE NEIGHBORHOODS TOGETHER FOR THE MOST PART.

20:05:30 SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I THINK WOULD BE BEST SUITING FOR NOT MAKING TOO 
20:05:34 MUCH CHANGES TO THE CURRENT -- FROM THE CURRENT DISTRICTS.

20:05:42 AND ALSO KEEPING THE POPULATION OF EACH DISTRICT PRETTY CLOSE.

20:05:48 SO I THINK YOU WANT TO ADD LIKE A LITTLE SLIVER OF DISTRICT 2 TO 
20:05:53 DISTRICT 1, JUST TO MAKE UP A LITTLE BIT OF POPULATION, IT KIND OF DOESN'T 
20:05:54 MAKE SENSE.

20:06:00 SO THAT'S MY COMMENT.

20:06:01 THANK YOU.

20:06:02 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

20:06:11 >> JUST TO REMIND THE WHOLE COUNCIL THAT IDEALLY, WE CAN WALK AWAY FROM 
20:06:16 THIS EVENING WITH A LIST OF MAPS THAT ARE PERHAPS CURRENTLY YOUR PREFERRED 
20:06:20 MAPS AND IF THERE'S ANY CHANGES THAT YOU THINK NEED TO BE MADE TO THOSE, 
20:06:21 PLEASE DIRECT ME TO DO  SO.

20:06:25 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

20:06:31 >> Ms. Briggs: I'M SORRY, MADAME MAYOR, WE ARE AS THE STAFF REPORT INDICATES 
20:06:35 ASKING THAT YOU AS A COUNCIL GIVE DIRECTION ON POTENTIALLY ONE TO THREE 
20:06:40 MAPS, SO NARROWING DOWN THE NUMBER THAT WE'RE REVIEWING AND POTENTIALLY 
20:06:41 MODIFYING.

20:06:49 >> Mayor Mei: WELL, I'VE HEARD SO FAR SOME OF THE FEEDBACK FOR N DC GREEN.

20:06:53 I ALSO WANTED TO NOTE THAT I SAW ONE OF THE PRIORITY THAT HAVE COME UP THAT 
20:06:59 PARENTS ASK ME ABOUT OFTENTIMES, IS THE SCHOOL ATTENDANCE AREAS, MUCH LIKE 
20:07:05 KEEPING -- BECAUSE THAT HAS BEEN OF INTEREST FOR A LOT OF THE COMMUNITY 
20:07:05 MEMBERS.

20:07:09 SO I KNOW THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I WOULD DEFINITELY HIGHLIGHT, JUST 
20:07:15 BECAUSE OF THE BOUNDARIES THAT HAVE BEEN REALLY JUSTED BE AND IT'S BEEN 
20:07:19 VERY CONFUSING, I THINK, FOR SOME OF THE PARENTS, ESPECIALLY WHEN WE WENT 
20:07:21 TO REDISTRICTING AT FIRST, THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT MANY PEOPLE HAD SHARED 
20:07:22 WITH ME IN PARTICULAR.

20:07:24 BECAUSE THERE WAS A LOT OF CONFUSION ON THAT.

20:07:30 SO THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING -- THAT'S JUST BECAUSE SO MANY PEOPLE WOULD 
20:07:32 DEFINITELY CONSIDER THEM COMMUNITIES OF INTEREST.

20:07:41 COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, I THINK YOUR HAND IS RAISED.

20:07:50 >> Councilmember Kassan: I'M SORRY, BUT THE CURRENT -- WE CANNOT ACCEPT NDC 
20:07:52 GREEN THE WAY IT IS BECAUSE IT DOES DIVIDE UP CENTERVILLE.

20:07:56 I JUST -- I HOPE WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT THAT'S NOT THE RIGHT THING TO DO.

20:08:07 IF IT COULD BE CHANGED SO THAT IT DOESN'T DO THAT ANYMORE, THEN I HAVE 
20:08:12 NO PROBLEM WITH THE GREEN MAP, BUT THE WAY IT CURRENTLY  IS, I CANNOT SUPPORT 
20:08:13 IT.

20:08:18 AND I HOPE MY FELLOW COUNCILMEMBERS WILL AGREE THAT IT NOT ACCEPTABLE TO 
20:08:20 DIVIDE CENTERVILLE THAT WAY.

20:08:29 >> DO YOU HAVE ANY SPECIFIC CHANGE THAT YOU WOULD SUGGEST?

20:08:31 >> SORRY TO INTERRUPT.

20:08:32 THIS IS AMANDA.

20:08:33 ARE YOU ABLE TO PULL THE MAPS  UP?

20:08:35 >> Mayor Mei: THAT'S WHAT I WAS GOING TO ASK TOO.

20:08:36 >> OH, YEAH.

20:08:37 I'M LOOKING AT THEM.

20:08:38 LET ME SHARE MY SCREEN.

20:08:39 >> THANK YOU.

20:08:39 >> OF COURSE.

20:08:47 >> SO WE ARE LOOKING AT THE BLUE LINES OR THE CURRENT DISTRICT OUTLINES AND 
20:08:50 WE ARE LOOKING AT THE GREEN MAP RIGHT NOW.

20:08:55 >>

20:08:58 >> Councilmember Kassan: AS YOU CAN SEE RIGHT NOW, FREMONT BOULEVARD IS 
20:09:01 DIVIDED INTO TWO SEPARATE DISTRICTS.

20:09:02 >> YEP, RIGHT HERE.

20:09:05 >> Councilmember Kassan: SO IF THAT COULD BE MODIFIED, THEN I THINK IT 
20:09:06 WOULD BE FINE.

20:09:06 >> OKAY.

20:09:07 THAT'S VERY HELPFUL.

20:09:11 >> Mayor Mei: COULD YOU ZOOM OUT A LITTLE BIT MORE ON THAT?

20:09:19 BECAUSE I THINK FOR ME, AGAIN, AS I MENTIONED BEFORE, I'M A LITTLE 
20:09:22 CONCERNED ABOUT IS SCHOOL ATTENDANCE AREAS BECAUSE THAT IS ONE OF THE 
20:09:26 THINGS THAT WAS COMMENTED ON VERY EARLY ON WHEN WE FIRST WENT TO 
20:09:26 REDISTRICTING.

20:09:32 >> I WOULD CAUTION AROUND THAT SIMPLY BECAUSE WHAT -- IT'S IMPORTANT TO 
20:09:37 REMIND THE PUBLIC THAT WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE ARE CITY COUNCIL 
20:09:38 ELECTION DISTRICTS.

20:09:44 AND THE SCHOOL ATTENDANCE ZONES ARE SOMETHING THAT IS NOT AN ELECTION 
20:09:45 DISTRICT.

20:09:51 THEY MAY BE, LIKE YOU SAY, A COMMUNITY OF INTEREST, RIGHT, PEOPLE THAT 
20:09:52 DEFINITELY IDENTIFY WITH THAT.

20:10:00 SO I THINK IF THERE IS -- BUT USUALLY THOSE SCHOOL ATTENDANCE AREAS, THERE'S 
20:10:04 INTEREST FOR THE SCHOOL BOARD, BECAUSE THE SCHOOL BOARD IS WHAT GOVERNS THOSE 
20:10:08 SCHOOLS AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO CLARIFY THAT THAT'S NOT THE CITY COUNCIL.

20:10:13 >> Mayor Mei: SO I WAS GOING TO ASK THAT QUESTION TOO, AS WE KNOW RIGHT 
20:10:19 NOW, I THINK DUE TO THE TIMING OF THE CENSUS ORIGINALLY, WE HAVE CERTAINLY 
20:10:26 HAD A LOT MORE GROWTH IN DISTRICT 5, AND AS WE SEE DIFFERENT PLANNED 
20:10:26 DEVELOPMENTS COMING THROUGH.

20:10:30 IS THAT SOMETHING -- OBVIOUSLY WE CAN ONLY TAKE IT OFF OF THE SNAPSHOT AT 
20:10:31 THAT MOMENT, WHICH IS 2020.

20:10:32 WHEN WE DID THE CENSUS.

20:10:38 BUT I GUESS WE'D HAVE TO WAIT 10 MORE YEARS FOR THEM TO LOOK AT THE NEXT 
20:10:38 CHANGE.

20:10:44 >> WELL, WHAT I WOULD RECOMMEND IS IF YOU EXPECT DISTRICT 5 TO CONTINUE TO 
20:10:53 GROW, YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO ADOPT A MAP THAT THAT'S SIGNIFICANTLY 
20:10:53 OVERPOPULATED ALREADY.

20:10:58 YOU MAY BE MORE COMFORTABLE HAVING A NEGATIVE POPULATION DEVIATION FOR 5, 
20:10:59 ANTICIPATING THAT FUTURE GROWTH.

20:11:06 BUT AGAIN, THAT'S SOMETHING I WOULD ONLY CONSIDER AFTER YOU'RE CONFIDENT 
20:11:08 THAT ALL THE OTHER LEGAL CRITERIA HAVE BEEN MET.

20:11:09 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

20:11:11 I ALSO SEE COUNCILMEMBER JONES.

20:11:17 >> Councilmember Jones: THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR.

20:11:25 SO AGAIN, I'M LOOKING AT THE MINIMAL CHANGE MAP, AND I THINK THAT IF MOWRY 
20:11:30 WAS STRAIGHTENED DOWN AND TAKEN EAST OF PASEO PADRE, IT WOULD ELIMINATE THAT 
20:11:30 ISSUE.

20:11:33 IT DOES INCORPORATE BOTH SIDES OF FREMONT BOULEVARD.

20:11:36 FOR THE BUSINESS DISTRICT.

20:11:43 IF IT WAS A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE TO THE POPULATION  DISTRICT 3 COULD BE 
20:11:47 ADJUSTED A LITTLE BIT NORTH ALONG PASEO AND EAST UP TO MAYBE THORNTON, IF THAT 
20:11:52 WOULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE TO BALANCE THE NUMBERS, BUT I THINK THE IMPORTANT 
20:11:58 PART IS  STRAIGHTENING THE LINE ON MOWRY AND INCORPORATING BOTH SIDES OF 
20:11:58 FREMONT BOULEVARD INTO ONE DISTRICT.

20:12:00 THANK YOU.

20:12:05 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

20:12:08 COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, IS YOUR HAND STILL RAISED FROM BEFORE?

20:12:08 >> Councilmember Kassan: YES, IT IS.

20:12:09 I'M SORRY.

20:12:13 I JUST WAS THINKING THAT IF WE REALLY WANT TO KEEP CENTERVILLE TOGETHER, 
20:12:19 PUTTING A DIVIDING LINE AT CENTRAL, THAT REALLY DOES CUT THE DISTRICT IN 
20:12:21 HALF.

20:12:30 SO IF IT COULD POSSIBLY GO DOWN TO THORNTON, THAT WOULD MAKE IT MORE 
20:12:32 CONSISTENT WITH KEEPING THE ENTIRE THING TOGETHER.

20:12:36 SO RIGHT NOW ON THE GREEN MAP, THERE'S THE DIVIDING LINE ON CENTRAL.

20:12:44 AND IF IT COULD GO DOWN TO THORNTON, AND STILL INCORPORATE BOTH SIDES OF 
20:12:53 FREMONT BOULEVARD ALL WAY DOWN TO THORNTON, I THINK THAT WOULD BE A 
20:12:54 BETTER LINE.

20:13:01 AND THEN ON THE WEST SIDE OR SORRY THE EAST SIDE, MOVING IT FROM STEVENSON TO 
20:13:03 MOWRY IS A POSSIBILITY.

20:13:09 I KNOW COUNCILMEMBER JONES KEEPS MENTIONING MOWRY, NOT TOTAL LEISURE 
20:13:15 WHAT HE'S REFERRING TO WHEN HE'S TALKING ABOUT MOWRY, BUT RIGHT NOW THE 
20:13:17 LINE IS ON STEVENSON.

20:13:18 >> Mayor Mei: CAN WE PULL UP THAT MAP?

20:13:24 >> Councilmember Jones: ACTUALLY THE LINE DIVIDING 2 AND 3 IS ALONG MOWRY, 
20:13:30 AND THE GLEN MANOR, GLENMOOR, THAT'S THE DIVIDING LINE I'M TALKING ABOUT.

20:13:32 >> Councilmember Kassan:CURRENT LY?

20:13:35 >> CURRENTLY IT DIVIDES GLEN MANOR AND GLENMOOR.

20:13:43 SO IF YOU WERE TO EXTEND THAT LINE EAST ON MOWRY, IT WOULD TAKE INTO DISTRICT 
20:13:48 2 THEN GLEN MANOR AS WELL AS GLENMOOR, BUT IT ALSO INCORPORATES BOTH SIDES OF 
20:13:48 FREMONT BOULEVARD.

20:13:52 ON THE MINIMAL CHANGE MAP.

20:13:56 >> Councilmember Kassan: I'M CONFUSED NOW.

20:13:57 I'M SORRY.

20:14:01 >> SO I HAVE THE MINIMAL CHANGE MAP ADDED TO THE INTERACTIVE MAP FOR 
20:14:02 ANYONE WHO'S ON THEIR COMPUTER.

20:14:05 JUST HIT REFRESH AND YOU'LL NOW BE ABLE TO SEE THIS.

20:14:08  THIS MINIMAL CHANGE MAP.

20:14:11 >> Councilmember Kassan: WHAT DIVIDING LINE ON MOWRY ARE YOU REFERRING TO?

20:14:13 I'M SORRY, I'M NOT SEEING THAT.

20:14:19 >> Councilmember Jones: SO CAN YOU DO THE OVERLAY ON THE DISTRICT OUTLINES 
20:14:20 CURRENTLY?

20:14:23 >> YEAH, SO THEY'RE BLUE RIGHT NOW.

20:14:27 I DON'T KNOW HOW WELL YOU CAN SEE THEM, BUT THEY ARE THIS BLUE LINE HERE.

20:14:36 SO THE MINIMAL CHANGE, RIGHT, IS THE SAME AS -- YOU CAN SEE THE DIFFERENCE, 
20:14:41 FOR INSTANCE, THE DIFFERENCE IS IN MINIMAL CHANGE, DISTRICT 3 IS COMING 
20:14:43 PAST THE CURRENT LINE HERE AT STEVENSON.

20:14:49 >> Councilmember Jones: OKAY, I'M TALKING ABOUT THE NORTHERN BOUNDARY OF 
20:14:49 DISTRICT 3.

20:14:57 SO IT STARTS FROM THE WEST, IT GOES FROM 880 DOWN MOWRY.

20:14:59 I'M TRYING TO MOVE YOUR MAP BUT I CAN'T DO THAT.

20:15:07 IT GOES FROM THE WEST -- FROM 880 DOWN MOWRY, AND THEN IT CUTS IN, I BELIEVE, 
20:15:14 AT BLACOW AND THEN TURNS EAST, SO THERE WAS THAT CONCERN OF INCORPORATING THE 
20:15:20 AREA BASICALLY AT THE CORNER OF MOWRY AND FREMONT, EXTENDING THE BORDER TO 
20:15:25 THAT CORNER, AND IT STRAIGHTENS OUT FREMONT BOULEVARD AND MOWRY AVENUE BOTH.

20:15:27 >> I SEE.

20:15:28 HERE.

20:15:29 >> Councilmember Jones: CORRECT.

20:15:30 >> OKAY.

20:15:33 >> I CAN CERTAINLY LOOK AT THAT.

20:15:39 >> Councilmember Jones: AND THE MINUTE MALL CHANGE MAP ALSO INCORPORATES BOTH 
20:15:40 SIDES OF FREMONT BOULEVARD IN THE BUSINESS DISTRICT.

20:15:49 BUT I THOUGHT THE MAIN CONCERN WAS THE CHANGE, TAKING IT DOWN TO FREMONT AND 
20:15:55 MOWRY, BUT THE MINIMAL CHANGE MAP ACTUALLY EXTENDS IT, I BELIEVE, TO 
20:15:55 PASEO PADRE.

20:16:02 >> Councilmember Kassan: WHY DO YOU SAY THAT IT KEEPS ALL OF CENTERVILLE 
20:16:02 TOGETHER?

20:16:06 I'M SO CONFUSED WHY YOU WOULD BE SAYING THAT, BECAUSE THAT'S NOT THE CASE.

20:16:08 >> Councilmember Jones: WHAT PART DOES IT EXCLUDE?

20:16:13 >> Councilmember Kassan: SEE HOW FREMONT BOULEVARD IS -- THERE'S A PART 
20:16:17 OF IT WHERE ONE SIDE OF THE STREET IS GREEN AND ONE SIDE OF THE STREET IS 
20:16:17 BLUE?

20:16:20 >> RIGHT HERE WHERE IT SAYS CENTERVILLE DISTRICT.

20:16:22 THE WORD ITSELF IS ACTUALLY SPLIT.

20:16:24 CAN YOU SEE THAT?

20:16:27 THERE WE GO.

20:16:29 THAT LEVEL OF ZOOM, THE WORD ITSELF IS ACTUALLY SPLIT.

20:16:32 SO THIS IS THE AREA.

20:16:38 >> Councilmember Jones: SO  AGAIN, ONLINE, THIS PARTICULAR MAP DOES NOT 
20:16:39 HAVE STREET NAMES.

20:16:41 >> YEAH, I KNOW.

20:16:44 >> Councilmember Jones: SO IT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFICULT TO FOLLOW.

20:16:49 >> YEAH, PULL IT UP ON THE INTERACTIVE MAP, WHICH IS ALSO ON THAT DRAFT MAP 
20:16:52 WEBSITE, IF YOU WANT TO.

20:16:58 OTHERWISE FEEL FREE TO DIRECT ME TO MOVE THE MAP ON THE SCREEN.

20:17:11 >> Councilmember Jones: SO CURRENTLY, IF YOU COULD MOVE IT NORTH A LITTLE 
20:17:12 BIT TOWARDS THORNTON?

20:17:30 SO BLUE IS DISTRICT 2 IN THIS MAP, CORRECT?

20:17:31 >> CORRECT.

20:17:36 >> Councilmember Jones: SO THE CENTERVILLE BUSINESS DISTRICT RUNS 
20:17:45 FROM FREMONT BOULEVARD, FROM THORNTON TO CENTRAL.

20:17:48 SO THE ONLY THING THIS LEAVES OUT OF IT IS HOLY SPIRIT CHURCH.

20:17:54 BUT BOTH SIDES OF FREMONT BOULEVARD ARE INCORPORATED INTO THE BUSINESS 
20:17:54 DISTRICT IN THIS MAP.

20:18:02 IS THAT CORRECT?

20:18:14 >> I HAD A COMMENT ABOUT THAT.

20:18:16 >> Vice Mayor Salwan: I THINK CENTERVILLE BUSINESS DISTRICT IS 
20:18:19 USUALLY DEFINED BETWEEN CENTRAL AND THORNTON.

20:18:25 THAT'S KIND OF THE -- AND I THINK THE PLANNERS CAN MAKE A COMMENT ON THAT.

20:18:43 >> DOES STAFF HAVE BOUNDARIES FOR THE BUSINESS DISTRICT AVAILABLE?

20:18:49 AND I'LL JUST POINT OUT AGAIN --

20:18:52 >> Councilmember Kassan: AS SOMEONE WHO LIVES IN THAT AREA, I CAN SAY MY 
20:18:59 IMPRESSION OF WHAT IS CENTERVILLE GOES FARTHER, GOES BEYOND CENTRAL.

20:19:04 >> Mayor Mei: I'D LIKE TO ASK STAFF, WHAT DO WE CONSIDER WHEN IT COMES TO 
20:19:05 OUR ECONOMIC  DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT?

20:19:09 BECAUSE I KNOW WE HAVEN'T  DEFINED A LITTLE BIT THERE.

20:19:16 >> Ms. Briggs: I WOULD ADD IT'S PROBABLY DEFINED IN SOME WAY IN OUR 
20:19:20 PLANNING DOCUMENTS, AND WE CAN SHARE THAT WITH THE COUNCIL FROM A BUSINESS 
20:19:24 DISTRICT STANDPOINT, WE DON'T HAVE A PRECISE DEFINITION.

20:19:28 YOU KNOW, IT IS WHERE THERE ARE BUSINESSES THAT COALESCE OR WHERE 
20:19:32 THERE'S DEVELOPMENT  PLANNED OVER TIME.

20:19:36 SO REALLY, YOU KNOW, WOULD BE INTERESTED IN COUNCIL'S INPUT ON WHAT 
20:19:40 THEY CONSIDER TO BE THAT COMMUNITY OF INTEREST, ACTUALLY THAT WOULD BE 
20:19:40 HELPFUL.

20:19:45 >> Councilmember Kassan: AND THE COMMUNITY OF INTEREST IS NOT JUST 
20:19:47 WHERE THERE'S A LOT OF BUSINESSES.

20:19:54 IF YOU GO ALONG FREMONT BOULEVARD ON THAT STRETCH, THERE'S A LOT OF 
20:19:57 ACTIVITY THAT I DON'T THINK SHOULD BE DIVIDED.

20:20:00 SO THERE'S DIFFERENT APARTMENT BUILDINGS, THERE'S CHURCHES.

20:20:05 I JUST DON'T THINK IT SHOULD BE DIVIDED, EVEN IF IT'S NOT -- EVEN IF 
20:20:08 SOME PEOPLE DON'T CONSIDER THAT THE CORE OF THE BUSINESS DISTRICT.

20:20:16 >> Councilmember Jones: THE OTHER OPTION WOULD BE TO EXTEND MOWRY DOWN 
20:20:18 TO PASEO PADRE AND GO NORTH.

20:20:24 AND THAT WOULD INCORPORATE ALL OF THAT.

20:20:27 WHERE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT CENTERVILLE JUNIOR HIGH AND SOME OF THE APARTMENT 
20:20:30 COMPLEKS, THE PENTAGON AND SOME OF THE OTHERS THERE.

20:20:38 IT WOULD ALSO ENCOMPASS WASHINGTON HIGH SCHOOL, WHICH IS THE PREFERENCE OF 
20:20:42 SOME OF THE GLENMOOR RESIDENTS, OR A NUMBER OF THE GLENMOOR RESIDENTS.

20:20:53 >> SO WA WE'RE DISCUSSING IS ADDING ALL OF THIS TO  DISTRICT 2, IS THAT 
20:20:53 CORRECT?

20:21:01 >> Councilmember Jones: YEAH, TAKING THE LINE FROM BASICALLY MOWRY AND 880 
20:21:06 AND GOING DIRECTLY EAST, WITH COUNCILMEMBER  KASSAN'S SUGGESTION 
20:21:15 THAT FREMONT BOULEVARD'S BUSINESS DISTRICT COMES FURTHER SOUTH THAN SOME 
20:21:19 OF THE REST OF US WOULD DISAGREE WITH, BUT IF YOU TAKE MOWRY DIRECTLY EAST TO 
20:21:24 PASEO PADRE AND WENT NORTH FROM THERE, IT WOULD ENCOMPASS BOTH OF THOSE 
20:21:28 DISTRICTS, IT WOULD INCLUDE WASHINGTON HIGH SCHOOL WHICH I KNOW IS NOT PART 
20:21:32 OF THE EQUATION AS FAR AS HAVING TO INCLUDE THE ATTENDANCE AREAS, BUT IT 
20:21:36 HAS BEEN AN EXPRESSED DESIRE OF A LOT OF THE GLENMOOR RESIDENTS.

20:21:43 THAT WOULD KIND OF TAKE THAT INTO -- EVERYTHING INTO ACCOUNT THAT'S BEEN 
20:21:44  BROUGHT UP SO FAR.

20:21:49 BUT THE MAIN PART IS IT KEEPS THE BUSINESS DISTRICT TOGETHER AND 
20:21:55 STRAIGHTENS EVERYTHING OUT TO A LITTLE MORE -- I GUESS A REASONABLE EASIER TO 
20:21:55 READ MAP.

20:22:06 >> YEAH, SO THAT WOULD BE MORE SIMILAR THEN TO NDC PURPLE.

20:22:13 BUT WHAT I WOULD SAY IS, IF WE ARE GOING TO BE ADDING TO DISTRICT 2, 
20:22:19 POPULATION WISE, IS THERE ANY OTHER AREA OF DISTRICT 2 THAT COULD PERHAPS 
20:22:22 BE OF THE CURRENT BOUNDARIES,  RIGHT?

20:22:26 AND IF WE WANT TO JUST LOOK AT THE CURRENT DISTRICT, THAT COULD BE ADDED 
20:22:35 EITHER TO DISTRICT 1, DISTRICT 3, DISTRICT 4 HERE, SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE 
20:22:41 AN OVERPOPULATED DISTRICT 2.

20:22:48 IF YOU LOOK AT THE CURRENT, IT'S SLIGHTLY OVERPOPULATED, SO IF WE ADD 
20:22:53 MORE TO IT, WHAT WE WANT TO DO TO BALANCE IT RIGHT IS WE'LL WANT TO MAKE 
20:22:58 SURE WE'RE NOT JUST ADDING TO A CURRENTLY OVERPOPULATED.

20:23:02 >> Councilmember Jones: SO PREFERABLY 1 OR 4, CORRECT?

20:23:04 >> RIGHT.

20:23:06 >> Councilmember Kassan: WHAT ABOUT 80170?

20:23:10 I MEAN, THAT SEEMS TO DO A PRETTY GOOD JOB OF IT.

20:23:16 >> Ms. Briggs: I WAS ALSO GOING TO LET THE COUNCIL KNOW THAT OUR PLANNING 
20:23:19 MANAGER, JOEL PULLEN, CAN SHARE FOR CONSIDERATION WHAT THE PLANNING 
20:23:22 DOCUMENTS -- HOW THE CENTERVILLE DISTRICT IS DEFINED.

20:23:24 I BELIEVE JOEL IS ON THE  MEETING.

20:23:35 >> Planner Pullen: IF THE COUNCIL WANTS A LITTLE MORE INFORMATION, I CAN GIVE 
20:23:36 A COUPLE WAYS TO LOOK AT IT.

20:23:41 THERE ARE A LOT OF WAYS TO LOOK AT OUR COUNT CENTERS IN OUR PLANS.

20:23:48 OUR COMMUNITY PLAN AREA FOR CENTERVILLE INCLUDES THE AREA FREMONT BOULEVARD 
20:23:53 BETWEEN WASHINGTON HIGH SCHOOL ON ONE SIDE, COUNTRY DRIVE, AND DECOTO, AND 
20:24:00 THEN MORE PRECISELY THE TOWN CENTER PEDESTRIAN ZONING AND GENERAL PLAN 
20:24:06 AREAS EXTEND FROM A PROPERTY NORTH OF CENTRAL UP TO JUST SHORT OF ALDER.

20:24:11 SO THAT MIGHT BE HELPFUL FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION.

20:24:29 >> Mayor Mei: COUNCILMEMBER JONES, IS YOUR HAND STILL RAISED FROM BEFORE OR 
20:24:30 IS THAT --

20:24:31 >> Councilmember Jones: I DON'T KNOW WHY IT'S NOT GOING DOWN.

20:24:33 SORRY, MADAME MAYOR.

20:24:33 >> Mayor Mei: OKAY.

20:24:36 I WAS GOING TO MAKE ONE OTHER COMMENT THEN.

20:24:44 I KNOW THAT WHILE ATTENDANCE AREA IS NOT A PRIORITY, I ALSO NOTICED THAT 
20:24:51  WE'D IDEALLY HAVE ATTENDANCE AREAS SPLIT INTO TWO, NOT THREE.

20:24:54 THAT'S WHAT I WAS GOING TO MENTION WHEN I LOOKED AT THIS, AND I THINK THAT'S 
20:24:59 WHY WE DON'T WANT THEM SPLIT INTO THREE DISTRICTS FROM ONE ATTENDANCE AREA.

20:25:00 THAT GETS MORE COMPLICATED.

20:25:02 SO IF YOU COULD ZOOM OUT A LITTLE BIT.

20:25:06 BUT I THINK WE'RE GIVING SOME GENERAL DIRECTION, AND PERHAPS THAT WHAT WE 
20:25:07 CAN GO FROM THAT DIRECTION.

20:25:11 >> ABSOLUTELY.

20:25:13 THIS IS VERY HELPFUL.

20:25:19 IF THERE ARE ANY OTHER COUNCILMEMBERS WHO WANT TO IDENTIFY OF THE SET OF 
20:25:23 MAPS WHICH ONES ARE THEIR PREFERRED, THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL IN HELPING US 
20:25:28 SEE WHAT'S IN COMMON AND HOW WE MIGHT NARROW IT DOWN A LITTLE BIT MOVING 
20:25:28 FORWARD.

20:25:36 AND I CAN CERTAINLY ATTEMPT TO BRING BACK A REVISED VERSION.

20:25:43 I'M HEARING FROM THE COUNCIL, THERE'S SOME THAT LIKE NDC  GREEN, BUT WHAT WE 
20:25:53 WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT WAS IN MY MIND MORE OF CHANGES TO PURPLE, BUT I GUESS 
20:26:01 IT COULD BE CHANGES TO GREEN IN TERMS OF ADDING A LITTLE BIT MORE OF 
20:26:04 CENTERVILLE HERE.

20:26:10 >> Councilmember Kassan: IS THERE A REASON WE CAN'T LOOK AT 80170 --

20:26:11 >> WELL, HERE IT IS ON HERE.

20:26:14 FOR SOME REASON, AGAIN, IT'S NOT SHOWING ON THERE BUT I CAN FIX THAT.

20:26:19 BUT THIS ONE WE LOOKED AT AT THE LAST MEETING, IF YOU RECALL.

20:26:26 >> Councilmember Kassan: THIS ONE LOOKS GOOD TO ME.

20:26:28 I'D LOVE TO HEAR IF OTHERS HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT IT.

20:26:38 >> ACCORDING TO MY NOTE, THERE WAS CONCERN ABOUT ON THE COUNCIL ABOUT 
20:26:44 DIVIDING THIS MISSION SAN JOSÉ DISTRICT, THIS SORT OF NON-COMPACT 
20:26:44 CANDLE FLAME.

20:26:52 >> Mayor Mei: THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE BECAUSE THAT SPLITS IT INTO THREE THEN 
20:26:53 RIGHT THERE.

20:26:56 >> Councilmember Cox: THREE SECTIONS, YEAH.

20:27:04 >> Mayor Mei: BECAUSE WHILE I KNOW THAT SCHOOL DISTRICT ISN'T A PREDOMINANT 
20:27:08 DECISION-MAKING FACTOR, I THINK HAVING THREE WOULD NOT BE EASY FOR ANY 
20:27:09 ATTENDANCE AREA.

20:27:13 ESPECIALLY BECAUSE IT'S A VERY UNUSUAL -- LIKE AGAIN, THE COMPACTNESS.

20:27:20 >> THIS IS AN INTERESTING MAP, THOUGH, BECAUSE YOU CAN SEE WHAT IT DOES, AND 
20:27:25 THESE DISTRICTS AREN'T NUMBERED, OF COURSE, BUT IT'S REALLY -- IT'S 
20:27:29 LEAVING DISTRICT 1, BUT IT'S TAKING WHAT'S CURRENTLY DISTRICT 2 AND 
20:27:35 INCORPORATING IT WITH NILES TO THE NORTH, AND I KNOW THERE WAS ANOTHER 
20:27:41 MAP WE TALKED ABOUT TONIGHT THAT DID SOMETHING SIMILAR TO THIS, AND I AM 
20:27:50 HEARING FROM COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN THAT WHAT MIGHT BE THIS DISTRICT 3 HERE 
20:27:50 LOOKS GOOD.

20:27:54 SO TO THE EXTENT THAT WE CAN TAKE WHAT WE LIKE ABOUT THIS MAP AND TRY TO 
20:27:58 INCORPORATE IT INTO A MORE VIABLE MAP IS SOMETHING I'M HAPPY TO LOOK INTO 
20:28:00 FOR YOU.

20:28:08 >> Councilmember Cox: I'M GOING TO VOICE THAT DISTRICT 6, AS YOU HAD -- 
20:28:13 IT'S NOT GOING TO SOLVE THE SOLUTION FOR IRVINGTON BEING ONE WHOLE 
20:28:14 COMMUNITY OF INTEREST.

20:28:25 >> Mayor Mei: THAT'S ALSO ANOTHER -- IT'S GOING TO BE HARD TO -- IT DIVIDES 
20:28:30 IN THE MIDDLE RIGHT THERE SO IT DOESN'T --

20:28:32 >> Councilmember Cox: I THINK THERE COULD BE SOME OTHER MAPS WE COULD LOOK 
20:28:32 AT.

20:28:34 85739 MAYBE.

20:28:39 >> Mayor Mei: COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN, I SEE YOUR HAND IS RAISED.

20:28:39 OR VICE MAYOR.

20:28:41 >> Vice Mayor Salwan: YES.

20:28:46 AND I WILL CHIME IN TOO THAT THAT MAP, I THINK COMBINES MISSION SAN JOSÉ WITH 
20:28:49 IRVINGTON, SO KIND OF -- IT'S NOT REALLY COMPACT.

20:28:56 BUT I WAS THINKING THAT MAYBE WE BRING BACK 3, 1 WAS THE ONE COUNCILMEMBER 
20:29:01 JONES MENTIONED WITH MINIMAL CHANGE WITH STRAIGHTENING OUT THE LINES IN 
20:29:06 MOWRY AND PASEO, AND WE TRY TO KEEP THE CENTRAL -- CENTERVILLE BUSINESS 
20:29:08 DISTRICT CORE INTACT.

20:29:12 SECOND WOULD BE TO LOOK AT THE GREEN MAP.

20:29:18 AND THIRD WOULD BE SOMETHING A LITTLE DIFFERENT EXON, WHICH COUNCILMEMBER 
20:29:21 SHAO MENTIONED, JUST TO KEEP IT EXCITING.

20:29:29 SO THOSE WERE KIND OF THE THREE THAT I WOULD LIKE IN THAT DIRECTION TO MOVE 
20:29:29 FORWARD.

20:29:48 >> THAT MAP I MENTIONED FROM COUNCILMEMBER SHOE WAS PUBLIC 91064?

20:29:50 >> Councilmember Shao: THAT'S CORRECT.

20:29:53 >> Mayor Mei: IT KEEPS THE CENTERVILLE CONCERN, I KNOW THAT WAS MENTIONED.

20:30:00 >> Vice Mayor Salwan: I WOULD STILL LIKE DISTRICT 5 TO HAVE SOME OF THOSE 
20:30:02 WET LANDS.

20:30:09 >> THAT'S AN EASY FIX LUCKILY BECAUSE THERE'S NOT -- THERE'S ECOSYSTEM MORE 
20:30:10 SO THAN RESIDENTIAL.

20:30:10 >> Mayor Mei: YES.

20:30:19 >> THIS IS 91064.

20:30:20 >> Mayor Mei: OKAY.

20:30:31 >> Councilmember Jones: MY ONLY COMMENT ABOUT THAT IS DIVIDING SCHOOL 
20:30:33 ATTENDANCE AREAS, IF THAT IS A VIABLE CONCERN.

20:30:57 BECAUSE IT WOULD DIVIDE PART OF WASHINGTON AND PART OF AMERICAN.

20:30:59 >> ARE THERE OTHER COMMENTS ON THIS MAP?

20:31:04 GLRCHLT I WAS GOING TO ASK IF IT HELPED WITH DECREASING THE POPULATION IN 
20:31:08 DISTRICT 1, AS 1 OF THE THINGS THAT WERE CITED EARLIER.

20:31:10 >> IF ANYONE HAS SUGGESTIONS FOR THAT.

20:31:14 IF NOT, WE CAN KEEP IT AS IS, JUST KEEPING IN MIND THAT THAT LIMITS THE 
20:31:17 AMOUNT OF DEVIATION WE CAN HAVE IN OUR OTHER DISTRICTS.

20:31:35 >> Councilmember Cox: THIS  IS 91064?

20:31:37 >> 91064, YEAH.

20:31:53 >> Councilmember Cox: BELOW WHERE DISTRICT 6 IS, WHERE YOU HAVE THE 
20:32:05 YELLOW LINE, THE GOLD LINE THERE, SO YOU'RE CUTTING OUT THAT AREA OF 
20:32:07 STREETS THAT WOULD BE 880.

20:32:18 AND THAT WOULD GO INTO  DISTRICT 5.

20:32:22 >> THIS MAP IS EXTENDING THE DISTRICT 6 BOUNDARY OVER 880.

20:32:38 THE OTHER THING I SHOULD POINT OUT, IF YOU ARE LOOKING AT THIS BASE MAP, 
20:32:41 SOMETIMES IT'S ALSO HELPFUL TO LOOK AT THE SATELLITE VIEW.

20:32:45 YOU CLICK BASE MAP, IMAGERY, YOU CAN THEN ALSO SEE THE SATELLITE VIEW, 
20:32:50 WHICH CAN OFTEN BE VERY HELPFUL IN DELINEATING DIFFERENT AREAS.

20:33:05 >> Mayor Mei: COUNCILMEMBER COX, IS YOUR HAND STILL RAISED OR IS THAT FROM 
20:33:05 BEFORE?

20:33:11 >> Councilmember Cox: NO, I HAD RAISED IT AND WAS JUST COMMENTING ON THIS ONE 
20:33:18 FOR 91640.

20:33:21 >> Mayor Mei: 91064, MM-HMM.

20:33:21 >> Councilmember Cox: YEAH.

20:33:26 BECAUSE NORMALLY WE HAD JUST HAD IT UP TO 880 THERE, SO BEYOND THAT, THAT'S 
20:33:30 ACTUALLY HOLMES, BUT IS THAT WHERE THE WETLANDS START?

20:33:31 I CAN'T TELL.

20:33:36 I'M TRYING TO BLOW IT UP ON MY COMPUTER, AND THEN I'M LOOKING AT 
20:33:39 YOURS AND MINE IS KIND OF FADED WHEN I'M LOOKING AT --

20:33:43 >> OH, YEAH, NO, NOT -- I DON'T THINK -- IT'S NOT QUITE YET.

20:33:52 IF YOU LOOK AT THE SATELLITE IMAGERY, THERE'S STILL SOME OF 5 THAT'S ORANGE HERE.

20:33:54 >> Councilmember Cox: GOT IT.

20:33:58 SO IT WOULD GO TO WHERE THE ORANGE ENDS THERE.

20:33:58 >> EXACTLY.

20:33:59 >>

20:34:01 >> Councilmember Cox: THAT WOULD BE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF PACIFIC COMMONS.

20:34:15 COULD YOU PULL UP THE DEMOGRAPHIC SUMMARY FOR THAT ONE?

20:34:16 I CAN'T LOCATE THE ONE I HAVE.

20:34:18 >> SURE.

20:34:49 >> SO THIS ONE HAS A TOTAL DEVIATION, THIS MAP, 91064, AGAIN, IT'S NOT 
20:34:52  CHANGING THAT DISTRICT 1.

20:35:16 >> Mayor Mei: OKAY.

20:35:18 >> Councilmember Cox: THANK YOU.

20:35:29 >> Mayor Mei: VICE MAYOR SALWAN, I SEE YOUR HAND IS NOW RAISED.

20:35:32 >> Vice Mayor Salwan: I GUESS BASED ON THE COMMENTS, IT SOUNDS LIKE DISTRICT 
20:35:34 1, 5 AND 6 ARE PRETTY MUCH SET.

20:35:36 IT'S THE OTHER THREE WE NEED TO TWEAK.

20:35:42 AND SO IT SOUNDS LIKE THAT'S WHERE MOST OF THE DEBATE IS.

20:35:47 SO I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S A WAY TO TRY TO ENCOMPASS THOSE COMMENTS AND TRY TO 
20:35:53 ADDRESS THAT WITH A COUPLE MORE DRAFTS TO SEE HOW WE CAN TWEAK THE DIFFERENT 
20:35:55 VERSIONS?

20:35:59 >> Mayor Mei: I THINK THAT'S WHY WE ALSO MOVED OUR NEXT HEARING FROM APRIL 
20:36:01 TO MARCH, TO GIVE US SOME MORE TIME.

20:36:08 >> YEAH, AND THESE ARE HEAVILY POPULATED AREAS, SO ANY SMALL CHANGE 
20:36:13 IN THE BOUNDARY LINES COULD BE A LARGE CHANGE IN TERMS OF NUMBERS IN THESE 
20:36:14 AREAS HERE.

20:36:22 >> Mayor Mei: I SEE OUR COUNSEL DEBRA MARGOLIS RAISED HER HAND.

20:36:26 >> I JUST WANTED TO COMMENT THAT WE'RE HOPING YOU CAN MAKE A DECISION ON THE 
20:36:30 MAP AT THE NEXT HEARING ON MARCH 1ST BECAUSE WE ACTUALLY HAVE TO DO AN 
20:36:33 ORDINANCE AMENDMENT AND IT REQUIRES A SECOND READING AND TIME FOR TO BECOME 
20:36:36 EFFECTIVE, SO THAT WAS THE MAIN REASON FOR MOVING UP THE SCHEDULE.

20:36:42 SO THE MORE YOU CAN NARROW IN NOW AND GIVE CLEAR DIRECTION TO OUR CONSULTANT 
20:36:45 FOR BRINGING BACK A MAP THAT YOU THINK YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO SELECT, THAT 
20:36:46 WOULD BE HELPFUL.

20:36:52 >> Mayor Mei: I AM SUPPORTIVE OF THE IDEA OF THE THREE THAT WE'VE TALKED 
20:36:56 ABOUT, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT I THINK VICE MAYOR 
20:36:59 SALWAN HAD BROUGHT UP AND ALSO THE OTHER COUNCILMEMBERS, IF WE COULD DRAW 
20:37:01 THE CHANGES OFF OF THOSE THREE MAPS.

20:37:08 >> Councilmember Cox: CAN YOU PLEASE SUMMARIZE THE THREE MAPS, SO WE'RE 
20:37:12 CLEAR?

20:37:13 >> Mayor Mei: SURE.

20:37:15 VICE MAYOR SALWAN, I THINK YOU WERE THE ONE WHO BROUGHT THEM.

20:37:20 >> Vice Mayor Salwan: I THINK THIS IS -- WHAT'S THE NUMBER HERE?

20:37:23 >> Mayor Mei: 91064.

20:37:26 >> Vice Mayor Salwan: OH, THE ONE WE'RE LOOKING AT RIGHT NOW.

20:37:31 MY ONLY SUGGESTION WAS IF WE CAN MOVE THE BOUNDARY TO CENTRAL OR A LITTLE 
20:37:32 MORE SOUTH ON THIS ONE.

20:37:33 I DON'T KNOW IF IT POSSIBLE.

20:37:45 AND THIS WAS THE -- COUNCILMEMBER JONES MENTIONED THE MINIMAL CHANGE, MAKING 
20:37:51 CHANGE TO THE LINE ON MOWRY SO THERE'S NOT A JAGGED LINE AND GOING ALL THE 
20:37:52 WAY TO PASEO  PADRE.

20:37:54 RIGHT, COUNCILMEMBER JONES?

20:37:56 >> Councilmember Jones: CORRECT.

20:37:56 >> Vice Mayor Salwan: OKAY.

20:38:04 AND THEN THE THIRD WAS THE  GREENER --

20:38:06 >> Mayor Mei: I THINK YOU MENTIONED GREEN.

20:38:08 >> Councilmember Cox: WE MENTIONED GREEN.

20:38:12 >> Mayor Mei:  -- I HAD THAT DOWN HERE.

20:38:14 >> Vice Mayor Salwan: THIS ONE WAS PRETTY MINIMAL CHANGE ALSO.

20:38:20 >> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.

20:38:23 I'D LIKE TO ADD IN THE PURPLE MAP AS WELL.

20:38:40 >> SO WITH GREEN AND PURPLE, I AM GOING TO REVIEW THE CENTERVILLE AREA FOR 
20:38:41 SURE.

20:38:50 WITH THE MINIMAL CHANGE, I WILL SEE TO WHAT EXTENT WE CAN STRAIGHTEN OUT THIS 
20:38:54 BOUNDARY LINE HERE TOWARDS MOWRY, KEEPING IN MIND THAT THERE'S A LOT OF 
20:39:08 POPULATION AND DISTRICT 2 IS ALREADY OVER POPULATION, AND THEN WHEN WE 
20:39:14 LOOKED AT GREEN, I DO BELIEVE, COUNCILMEMBER COX, YOU WANTED TO GET 
20:39:16 BACK THIS  AREA?

20:39:19 IS THAT CORRECT?

20:39:24 >> Councilmember Cox: I'M SORRY, FOR THE GREEN?

20:39:26 I THINK IT WAS THIS ONE.

20:39:31 >> IT WAS THAT AREA UP TO DRISCOLL, FROM -- BETWEEN PASEO PADRE TO 
20:39:40 DRISCOLL THAT'S CURRENTLY IN THE DISTRICT, THAT WAS MOVED IN THIS MAP.

20:39:44 >> Mayor Mei: I THINK IT FALLS INTO THE MISSION ATTENDANCE, AREA, THOUGH, AND 
20:39:45  IT'S NOT THAT BIG A CHAIK.

20:39:50 BECAUSE 6 IS OVERPOPULATED, THAT MIGHT BE AN OPTION, IF IT OFFSETS IT.

20:39:57 BECAUSE I DON'T THINK 4 CAN MOVE ANY FURTHER, UNLESS IT MOVED INTO THE 
20:40:03 OTHER DISTRICTS.

20:40:14 >> Mayor Mei: VICE MAYOR SALWAN, DID YOU RAISE YOUR HAND?

20:40:15 >> Vice Mayor Salwan: NO.

20:40:15 >> Mayor Mei: OKAY.

20:40:18 >> Vice Mayor Salwan: NO, I'M GOOD.

20:40:21 SO THAT'S MY DIRECTION.

20:40:24 I DON'T KNOW IF WE WANT TO MAKE A MOTION OR GET MORE FEEDBACK.

20:40:31 >> Mayor Mei: FOUR, I KNOW IT'S NOT THE IDEAL THREE WE WANTED TO GET TO BUT WE 
20:40:32 HAVE THREE MAPS?

20:40:37 I THINK YOU MENTIONED THREE AND THEN COUNCILMEMBER COX MENTIONED PURPLE, 
20:40:41 BUT I DON'T KNOW IF THE OTHER COUNCILMEMBERS HAD ANY FEEDBACK ON 
20:40:44 THOSE THREE OR IF THEY WANTED TO -- BECAUSE I THINK WE'RE TRYING TO GET TO 
20:40:44 THREE.

20:40:45 COUNCILMEMBER SHAO.

20:40:51 >> Councilmember Shao: WITH REGARD TO THE MAP ON THE SCREEN, INDEED THAT 
20:40:57 LITTLE AREA THAT  USED TO BE IN DISTRICT 6, ALMOST LIKE A TRIANGLE 
20:41:06 AREA, THAT IS PART OF THE GOMES AREA, AND GOES TO MISSION SAN JOSÉ.

20:41:15 AND AS FOR THE FINAL CHOICES, I WOULD LIKE TO SUBMIT THREE, THOSE THREE 
20:41:18 PROPOSED BY COUNCILMEMBER -- OR VICE MAYOR SALWAN IN THIS CASE.

20:41:20 >> Mayor Mei: OKAY.

20:41:29 I'M WAITING TO HEAR FROM THE OTHER COUNCILMEMBERS BECAUSE WE'RE TRYING TO 
20:41:37 GET TO THREE, IS OUR GOAL, SO WE CAN HAVE -- OF COURSE OUR CONSULTANTS WILL 
20:41:44 ALSO COME BACK AND GIVE US SOME OTHER FEEDBACK IN TERMS OF MODIFICATIONS 
20:41:50 FROM NATIONAL DEMOGRAPHICS.

20:41:50 >> YES, ABSOLUTELY.

20:41:57 I DON'T NECESSARILY NEED A MOTION IN ORDER TO TAKE YOUR DIRECTION.

20:41:58 >> Mayor Mei: OKAY.

20:42:02 >> SO I WILL CERTAINLY COME BACK TO YOU, AND I WILL CONNECT WITH STAFF AS 
20:42:06  WELL TO MAKE SURE THERE'S NOTHING THAT I'M  MISSING.

20:42:09 >> Mayor Mei: SURE.

20:42:14 COUNCILMEMBER COX, YOUR HAND IS RAISED AGAIN OR JUST FROM  BEFORE?

20:42:16 >> Councilmember Cox: OH, I GUESS I DIDN'T LOWER IT.

20:42:21 THERE WAS ACTUALLY ONE MAP THAT IF YOU COULD PULL UP 85739.

20:42:39 THAT REALLY MAKES IT JAGGED.

20:42:40 NEVER MIND.

20:42:42 IT LOOKS DIFFERENT ON YOUR COMPUTER THAN MINE.

20:42:46 IT LOOKS A LOT --

20:42:52 >> KEEP IN MIND, WE'RE JUST LOOKING AT THE COLOR.

20:42:55 THE JAGGED LINES HERE ARE THE CURRENT DISTRICTS.

20:42:56 JUST FOR COMPARISON SAKE.

20:42:58 >> Councilmember Cox: GOT IT.

20:43:04 >> SO IF I TURN OFF THE CURRENT DISTRICTS, THEN YOU CAN REALLY SEE 
20:43:05 WHERE THOSE LINES ARE.

20:43:09 >> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.

20:43:16 I'M NOT INTERESTED IN THE 85739 THEN.

20:43:17 >> Mayor Mei: OKAY.

20:43:19 THANK YOU.

20:43:24 I THINK WE'VE GIVEN DIRECTION AND THAT HOPEFULLY WILL HELP US GET TO THE TOP 
20:43:25 THREE AND BE ABLE TO MAKE A SELECTION.

20:43:29 THE EARLIER YOU GET THEM OUT TO THE PUBLIC AND US ALLOW US  BETTER 
20:43:29 FEEDBACK.

20:43:31 AND FINAL DECISION-MAKING.

20:43:32 SO THANK YOU.

20:43:34 >> ABSOLUTELY.

20:43:38 AND THE ONLY THING -- THE ONLY WARNING I WILL GIVE YOU IS THAT SOME OF THESE 
20:43:42 CHANGES MAY NOT BE POSSIBLE BECAUSE OF POPULATION BALANCE.

20:43:42 >> Mayor Mei: YES.

20:43:44 >> SO WE'LL DO OUR BEST.

20:43:48 BUT WE MAY NOT SEE EVERYTHING.

20:43:50 >> Mayor Mei: REAL QUICKLY, I'M DOING A TIME CHECK.

20:43:55 I KNOW WE HAVE A STENOCAPTIONER AND IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO GIVE THEM A 
20:43:57 BREAK AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME.

20:44:03 I SEE OUR ATTORNEY COUNSEL DEBRA MARGOLIS, YOU RAISED YOUR HAND?

20:44:07 >> JUST FOR POINT OF CLARIFICATION, I THINK WHAT I'M HEARING IS YOU'VE 
20:44:09 NARROWED DOWN TO FOUR MAPS.

20:44:14 BUT KRISTEN IS GOING TO TAKE YOUR COMMENTS AND INCORPORATE THEM AND THAT 
20:44:16 MAY END UP WITH THREE?

20:44:18 >> Mayor Mei: YES.

20:44:20 I THINK WE HAD THREE.

20:44:26 >> I HAVE NDC GREEN, NDC MINIMAL CHANGE, AND PUBLIC 91064.

20:44:32 AND THEN TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, YOU KNOW, TWEAKING ANY OF THOSE MAPS.

20:44:38 MS. MARGOLIS OKAY, AND THERE'S CONSENSUS FROM THE COUNCIL ON THOSE THREE?

20:44:44 >> Mayor Mei: WELL, AT LEAST I THINK INCORPORATING THE CONCERNS THAT WE'VE 
20:44:45 HEARD.

20:44:48 COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, DID YOU RAISE YOUR HAND AGAIN?

20:44:52 >> Councilmember Kassan: YEAH, I MEAN, I JUST -- I CAN'T SAY -- IT'S SO HARD 
20:44:55 TO SAY IF THERE'S CONSENSUS BECAUSE WE JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO 
20:44:55 LOOK LIKE.

20:45:01 BUT I HAVE CONFIDENCE IN KRISTEN AND HER TEAM THAT SHE HEARD US AND SHE 
20:45:03 WILL TAKE INTO ACCOUNT WHAT WE SAID.

20:45:10 SO -- I MAY NOT NECESSARILY SAY THERE WAS CONSENSUS ON ANY OF THE MAPS 
20:45:10 EXACTLY.

20:45:11 MS. MARGOLIS UNDERSTOOD.

20:45:14 MY POINT WAS WE'RE KIND OF DOWN TO THREE THAT WE'RE GOING TO WORK WITH AT 
20:45:18 THIS POINT IN TIME, NOT THAT ANYONE IS AGREEING TO ANY OF THEM YET.

20:45:18 >> Mayor Mei: NO.

20:45:19 YES.

20:45:24 >> Councilmember Cox: I ALSO  ADDED PURPLE MAP AS A POSSIBILITY IN CASE 
20:45:29 SOMETHING HAPPENS THAT WE MAY HAVE TO FALL OUT AND YOU MAY NEED A BACKUP.

20:45:40 DEPENDING ON IF -- THE CHANGES OF THE CENTERVILLE AREA, DEPENDING ON THAT.

20:45:52 >> Mayor Mei: HAVE I HEARD ANY SUPPORT OF BASING OFF OF PURPLE FROM THE OTHER 
20:45:53 COUNCILMEMBERS?

20:45:56 >> Vice Mayor Salwan: WE CAN ALWAYS BRING IT BACK IF SOMETHING DOESN'T 
20:45:57 WORK.

20:45:59 >> YES.

20:46:05 I THINK DEBRA HAS SHARED HER CONCERNS, THE TIMING BECAUSE OF THIS SECOND 
20:46:08 READING, BUT I THINK WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO MODIFY OFF OF THOSE THREE.

20:46:14 WAS THERE SOMETHING IN PARTICULAR IN PURPLE THAT WAS OF INTEREST, 
20:46:15 COUNCILMEMBER COX?

20:46:17 BECAUSE I'M NOT HEARING FROM THE OTHER COUNCILMEMBERS.

20:46:27 >> Councilmember Cox: WELL, IT'S KEEPING IN THE LINES OF IRVINGTON, 
20:46:27 KEEPING IT WHOLE.

20:46:35 AND NOT COMING -- WITH OTHER POINTS OF INTEREST.

20:46:40 >> Mayor Mei: I THINK WE'RE GOING TO TRY FOR AS MANY OF THE ATTENDANCE 
20:46:45 AREAS TO KEEP THEM, BUT IT LOOKS LIKE THAT MAY NOT BE POSSIBLE IN THAT IS 
20:46:47 THE MOST POPULATED DISTRICT.

20:46:51 THAT'S THE ONLY THING IS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO ALLOCATE THE 
20:46:52 POPULATION.

20:46:57 SO I'D HAVE FAITH ALSO IN KRISTEN IN TERMS OF TRYING TO PUT THIS TOGETHER 
20:46:58 WITH ALL OF  US.

20:47:00 BUT --

20:47:00 >> Councilmember Cox: OF COURSE.

20:47:07 YES, WE'LL ENTRUST KRISTEN IN COMING BACK WITH WORKING OUT HER MAGIC, 
20:47:09 WORKING OUT HER NUMBERS AND ANALYSIS.

20:47:10 >> IT'S NOT EASY STUFF.

20:47:15 IF ANY OF YOU HAVE SAT DOWN AND TRIED, ALL WE CAN DO IS COMMEND ALL OF THE 
20:47:20 MEMBERS OF PUBLIC, BY THE WAY, WHO WERE ABLE TO SUBMIT POPULATION BALANCED 
20:47:23 MAPS, THAT IS SUCH A POSITIVE REFLECTION ON THE OUTREACH THAT YOUR 
20:47:27 STAFF HAS CONDUCTED, AND THE RESIDENTS OF FREMONT FOR THEIR ENGAGEMENT.

20:47:30 >> Mayor Mei: WE DEFINITELY HAVE SOME VERY ENGAGED COMMUNITY MEMBERS.

20:47:35 SO SPEAKING OF WHICH, I WANTED TO BE RESPECTIVE OF THE STENOCAPTIONER.

20:47:37 WE DO NEED TO TAKE A BREAK.

20:47:42 USUALLY AN HOUR AND A HALF INTO IT, SO USUALLY AT 8:30 AND WE ARE RUNNING 
20:47:46 LATE SO WE NEED TO TAKE A 10-MINUTE BREAK TO ALLOW OUR STENOCAPTIONER A 
20:47:50 BREAK AND WE'LL RESUME THEN WITH ITEM --

20:47:53 >> Ms. Gauthier: MAYOR, IF WE'RE FINISHED WITH THIS ITEM, WE NEED TO 
20:47:57 CLOSE THE -- WELL, YOU'VE ALREADY CLOSED THE PUBLIC HEARING, PUBLIC 
20:48:04 COMMENT PERIOD, BUT WE NEED TO RELEASE THE INTERPRETERS ON THIS PARTICULAR 
20:48:09 ITEM, SO I JUST WANT TO VERIFY THAT WE ARE -- THAT WE CAN DO THAT AND WE'LL 
20:48:14 LET PATTY BACK IN TO DO WHAT SHE NEEDS TO DO WHEN WE GO TO BREAK.

20:48:15 >> Mayor Mei: GREAT.

20:48:15 THANK YOU.

20:48:18 I THINK THAT'S GOOD TIMING AND SHIFT CHANGE.

20:48:25 WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A 10-MINUTE BREAK AND ALLOW PATTY CHANGE THAT AND 
20:48:28 COUNCILMEMBERS ON THE 10-MINUTE BREAK, IF YOU COULD MUTE YOUR MIC AND ALSO 
20:48:30 TURN OFF YOUR VIDEO, THAT WOULD BE GREAT.

20:48:30 THANK YOU.

20:48:32 SEE YOU IN 10 MINUTES.

20:48:45 






20:49:04 



20:57:22 [ RECESS.]

20:57:23 >> Mayor Mei:   I'M GOING TO 

20:57:24 START CALLING PEOPLE TO COME 

20:57:24 BACK.

20:57:26 I KNOW IT TAKES A FEW MINUTES 

20:57:27 SOMETIMES.

20:57:51 WELCOME BACK COUNCILMEMBER 

20:57:53 SALWAN I THINK AND THEN ALL THE 

20:57:53 COUNCIL.

20:58:08 AND WE'LL WAIT FOR OUR CITY 

20:58:10 MANAGER AND CITY ATTORNEY AND 

20:58:14 SPEAKERS.

20:58:17 >> AND HANS LAWRENCE IS THE 

20:58:19 PRESENTER FOR THE NEXT ONE.

20:58:24 OKAY THERE'S MR. LARSEN.

20:58:25 >> Mayor Mei:   NEXT ITEM WILL 

20:58:30 BE B, SABERCAT.

20:58:44 JEEFNY SUYEISHI, WAYLAND LI AND 

20:58:45  

20:58:47  

20:58:52 JODI KITTLESON WILL BE 

20:58:53 AVAILABLE.

20:58:54 >> Hans Larsen:   THANK YOU, 

20:58:57 MAYOR MEI, I'LL BEGIN BY SHARING 

20:58:59 MY KOREAN.

20:59:01  SCREEN.

20:59:02 LET ME CONFIRM THAT THAT'S 

20:59:03 VISIBLE TO YOU.

20:59:05 >> Mayor Mei:   YES.

20:59:06 >> Hans Larsen:   GOOD EVENING, 

20:59:07 MAYOR MEI AND MEMBERS OF THE 

20:59:08 COUNCIL.

20:59:11 THE TOMMIC IS THE SABERCAT TRAIL 

20:59:13 EXTENSION PROJECT AND TONIGHT 

20:59:14 STAFF IS RECOMMENDING YOUR 

20:59:16 APPROVAL OF THIS PROJECT AND ITS 

20:59:16 ENVIRONMENTAL CLEARANCE.

20:59:18 THIS WILL BE CONDUCTED AS PART 

20:59:20 OF A PUBLIC HEARING PROCESS IN 

20:59:23 ACCORDANCE WITH CEQA.

20:59:25 WE'RE ALSO RECOMMENDING SOME 

20:59:26 FUNDING ACTIONS THAT ARE 

20:59:28 INTENDED TO ENHANCE AND EXPAND 

20:59:30 UPON THIS PROJECT WHICH WOULD BE 

20:59:32 PART OF THE FUTURE ENVIRONMENTAL 

20:59:32 CLEARANCE ACTIONS.

20:59:35 I'M GOING TO START WITH A BRIEF 

20:59:37 OVERVIEW PRESENTATION.

20:59:39 AND FOCUS IN ON THE IMAGE ON THE 

20:59:42 SLIDE HERE.

20:59:44 WHICH IS THE MAP OF THE EXISTING 

20:59:46 SABERCAT HISTORICAL PARK.

20:59:49 THE TRAIL WITHIN THE PARK IS 

20:59:51  

20:59:53 ABOUT TWO MILES LONG AND I JUST 

20:59:55 WANT TO POINT OUT A FEW KEY 

20:59:57 FEATURES THAT ARE RELEVANT TO 

20:59:58 TONIGHT'S DISCUSSION.

21:00:00 IF YOU CAN SEE MY CURSOR HERE 

21:00:02 THIS IS AT THE EASTERN END OF 

21:00:05 THE TRAIL WHICH ENDS AT PINE 

21:00:07 STREET AND ONE OF OUR GOALS IS 

21:00:09 TO ACTUALLY EXTEND THIS TRAIL 

21:00:10 FURTHER TO THE EAST TO CONNECT 

21:00:11 WITH THE MISSION SAN JOSE 

21:00:13 BUSINESS DISTRICT, OHLONE 

21:00:14 COLLEGE AND EVENTUALLY TO THE 

21:00:17 TRAIL HEAD LEADING TO MISSION 

21:00:17 PEAK.

21:00:19 WITHIN THE PARK, AS I MENTIONED 

21:00:21 THERE'S A TWO MILE LONG TRAIL.

21:00:25 AND WE ARE RECOMMENDING, AS AN 

21:00:27 ENHANCEMENT TO THE OVERALL 

21:00:31 PROJECT, TO UPGRADE THE TRAIL TO 

21:00:33 ACCOMMODATE IMPROVEMENTS TO MAKE 

21:00:34 IT SAFER, MORE ACCOMMODATING FOR 

21:00:37 ALL USERS, BUT IMPORTANTLY, TO 

21:00:38 ACCOMMODATE WHAT'S PROPOSED TO 

21:00:41 BE MORE USE OF THE TRAIL BY 

21:00:42 BUILDING OTHER CONNECTIONS.

21:00:47 ON THE WESTERN EDGE IS BELL 

21:00:48 QUARRY.

21:00:49 THERE IS NOT A TRAIL THAT GOES 

21:00:52 THERE NOW BUT WE WOULD PROPOSE 

21:00:53 TO EXTEND TO THIS AREA.

21:00:55 THIS IS THE SITE OF A VERY 

21:00:57 SIGNIFICANT DISCOVERY OF ICE AGE 

21:00:58 FOSSILS.

21:01:01 AND THE PROJECT PLANS TO 

21:01:02 CELEBRATE THIS REALLY SPECIAL 

21:01:05 AND UNIQUE PART OF FREMONT'S 

21:01:07 HISTORY INCLUDING A POTENTIAL 

21:01:08 MUSEUM FOR THE FOSSILS.

21:01:12 AND THEN, THE LAST PIECE WHICH 

21:01:14 IS REALLY THE MAIN FOCUS OF THE 

21:01:16 ITEM TONIGHT, IS THE PROPOSED 

21:01:18 WESTERN EXTENSION OF THE TRAIL 

21:01:21 OVER THE 680 FREEWAY AND 

21:01:23 CONNECTING INTO THE IRVINGTON 

21:01:25 COMMUNITY.

21:01:27 SO THE PROPOSED PROJECT FOR 

21:01:30 WHICH WE PREPARED AN 

21:01:31 ENVIRONMENTAL CLEARANCE FOR IS 

21:01:32 DEPICTED ON THIS MAP.

21:01:36 AND SO IT INCLUDES A WESTERN 

21:01:40 EXTENSION THROUGH PARK OVER 680, 

21:01:43 ACROSS A PROPERTY THAT'S OWNED 

21:01:46 BY CALTRANS TO OSGOOD ROAD AND 

21:01:48 THEN EXTENDING IN THE BLACOW 

21:01:52 CORRIDOR OVER THE BART AND U.P. 

21:01:54 TRACKS AND INTO THE IRVINGTON 

21:01:54 NEIGHBORHOOD.

21:01:56 THE PROJECT ALSO INCLUDES WHAT 

21:01:58 WE CALL A NORTHERN TRAIL SHOWN 

21:02:01 IN PINK WHICH EXTENDS TO THE 

21:02:03 NORTH, NORTHWEST, THAT WOULD TIE 

21:02:05 ALONG THE EDGE OF THE HILLSIDE, 

21:02:08 CONNECT WITH THE FUCH IRVINGTON 

21:02:12  FUTURE 

21:02:13 IRVINGTON BART STATION HERE.

21:02:15 WITHIN THE PROJECT WOULD BE AN 

21:02:18 INTERPRETIVE PLAZA WHICH 

21:02:22 CELEBRATES THE FOSSILS, AND IN A 

21:02:25 SEPARATE PROJECT WE ARE PLANNING 

21:02:26 FOR A POSSIBLE FOSSIL MUSEUM.

21:02:29 A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SORT OF THE 

21:02:31 PLANNING CONTEXT.

21:02:33 AS YOU'VE HEARD IN OTHER 

21:02:35 PRESENTATIONS, THE FREMONT 

21:02:36 COMMUNITY REALLY LOVES ITS 

21:02:38 TRAILS AND WE HEARD THAT THROUGH 

21:02:39 A STATISTICALLY VALID SURVEY 

21:02:41 THAT WAS COWBTDED AS PART OF THE 

21:02:45 DEVELOPMENT OF THE PARKS AND 

21:02:48 RECREATION MASTER PLAN, ACTUALLY 

21:02:50 EXPANDING THE PARKS AND TRAILS 

21:02:51 IN FREMONT WAS ONE OF THE 

21:02:53 HIGHEST PRIORITIES.

21:02:55 THE SABERCAT TRAIL IS INCLUDED 

21:02:56 IN OTHER DOCUMENTS INCLUDING THE 

21:02:58 TRAIL STRATEGY PLAN THE GENERAL 

21:02:59 PLAN AND THE BIKE MASTER PLAN 

21:03:00 AND THIS IS A REALLY EXCITING 

21:03:02 TIME TO BE BUILDING TRAILS 

21:03:03 BECAUSE OF THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING 

21:03:05 THAT'S AVAILABLE AT THE 

21:03:07 REGIONAL, STATE, AND NOW THE 

21:03:08 FEDERAL LEVEL.

21:03:10 AND WE'RE HAPPY TO REPORT THAT 

21:03:12 THE SABERCAT TRAIL EXTENSION 

21:03:15 PROJECT HAS BEEN CLASSIFIED AS A 

21:03:17 HIGH PRIORITY OR THE REGIONAL 

21:03:21 FUNDING.

21:03:22 GOING BACK A LITTLE BIT A FEW 

21:03:25 YEARS AGO, WE BEGAN LOOKING 

21:03:26 SERIOUSLY AT THE PROJECT TO 

21:03:29 EXTEND THE TRAIL, PARTICULARLY 

21:03:31 OVER THE 680 FREEWAY.

21:03:32 SO WE COMPLETED A SCOPING REPORT 

21:03:35 TO IDENTIFY WHAT THAT MIGHT COST 

21:03:36 AND ENTAIL.

21:03:38 AND THEN WE WERE PLEASED TO 

21:03:42 RECEIVE A $5.7 MILLION GRANT 

21:03:46 FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA, 

21:03:49 THANK TO LARGE PART BY THE 

21:03:52 EFFORT OF STATE SENATOR BOB 

21:03:54 WIECKOWSKI.

21:03:55 THAT IS ENOUGH TO DO PLANNING 

21:03:56 AND ENVIRONMENTAL CLEARANCE AND 

21:03:57 IF THE PROJECT IS APPROVED WILL 

21:03:59 ALLOW US TO MOVE INTO FINAL 

21:04:01 DESIGN AND THEN IT ALSO INCLUDES 

21:04:03 RESOURCES TO DO PLANNING FOR A 

21:04:04 FOSSIL MUSEUM.

21:04:06 SO WITH THIS GRANT FUNDING, WE 

21:04:11 HIRED THE CONSULTING FIRM OF T. 

21:04:15 Y. LIN INTERNATIONAL, TO HIP US 

21:04:17 DO ENVIRONMENTAL CLEARANCE AND 

21:04:18 FINAL DESIGN IF THE PROJECT IS 

21:04:18 APPROVED.

21:04:20 WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO NOW IS 

21:04:28 INTRODUCE YOU TO JODI KITTLESON 

21:04:31 FROM T.Y. LIN AND SHE'LL PROVIDE 

21:04:34 AN OVERVIEW OF THAT WORK EFFORT.

21:04:35 >> THANK YOU HANS.

21:04:35 THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

21:04:38 WELL, WE'VE HAD SOME HURDLES BUT 

21:04:40 EVEN THOUGH WE'VE HAD THIS 

21:04:41 PANDEMIC WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO HAVE 

21:04:44 A VERY ROBUST COMMUNITY OUTREACH 

21:04:45 AND COMMUNITY PROCESS.

21:04:48 WE HELD THREE COMMUNITY MEETINGS 

21:04:49 AND WE STARTED OFF WITH A 

21:04:51 COMMUNITY SURVEY AND THAT WAY WE 

21:04:53 COULD COLLECT A BROAD RANGE OF 

21:04:55 INPUT SO THAT COULD FORM THE 

21:04:56 DEVELOPMENT OF THE PROJECT AS 

21:04:57 WELL AS GIVE US INSIGHTS ABOUT 

21:04:59 ANY SORT OF ENVIRONMENTAL OR 

21:05:00 NEIGHBORHOOD CONCERNS.

21:05:01 AND THEN WE CAME BACK TO THE 

21:05:03 PUBLIC TO EXPLAIN WHAT WE HEARD 

21:05:05 FROM THEM AND HOW WE'RE 

21:05:09 INTEGRATING THAT INTO THE PUBLIC -- EXCUSE ME INTO THE 

21:05:11 PROJECT, AND THEN WE CAME BACK 

21:05:12 AGAIN WITH THE FURTHER 

21:05:13 REFINEMENT.

21:05:14 SO REALLY THIS IS NOT A NEW 

21:05:16 PROJECT TO YOUR COMMUNITY.

21:05:17 IN FACT EVERY ONE OF THESE 

21:05:19 MEETINGS AND THE FACT SHEETS FOR 

21:05:21 THE PROJECT ARE ALWAYS HAVE BEEN 

21:05:24 POSTED ON THE WEB, EVERY TIME 

21:05:28 WE'VE HEARD A LOT OF 

21:05:29 RESPONSES -- EXCUSE ME COMMENTS 

21:05:31 WE'VE TAKEN THE TIME TO DEVELOP 

21:05:32 THE FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS 

21:05:34 THERE AND FEBRUARY 10th WAS 

21:05:36 THE END OF THE 30-DAY COMMENT 

21:05:38 PERIOD THAT STARTED ON JANUARY 

21:05:42 10th.

21:05:43 AND SO WE'RE HERE TODAY BECAUSE 

21:05:45 THAT PERIOD IS CLOSED AND I'D 

21:05:47 LIKE TO TALK TO YOU ON THE NEXT 

21:05:49 SLIDE ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENTAL 

21:05:50 ANALYSES.

21:05:52 LIKE I SAID WE'VE BEEN VERY 

21:05:53 PROACTIVE WITH THE PUBLIC, WE'VE 

21:05:56 BEEN WORK HAND IN HAND WITH THE 

21:05:57 ENGINEERS AND THE ENVIRONMENTAL 

21:06:00 GROUPS TOGETHER SO THAT WE COULD 

21:06:01 AVOID MOST ALL IMPACTS.

21:06:03 IN FACT WE ARE DEVELOPING, WE 

21:06:04 HAVE DEVELOPED AND YOU HAVE IN 

21:06:06 FRONT OF YOU THE INITIAL STUDY 

21:06:17 AND DRAF AMBIGUITIED 

21:06:19 ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT STATEMENT.

21:06:22 I'M HAPPY TO SAY THAT THE 

21:06:23 MITIGATION MEASURES WE'VE 

21:06:24 DEVELOPED TO REDUCE THESE 

21:06:25 IMPACTS TO LESS THAN SIGNIFICANT 

21:06:30 ARE THERE TO PROACTIVELY 

21:06:31 MINIMIZE AND CONTINUE TO 

21:06:33 UNDERSTAND THAT IF WE DO FIND 

21:06:34 THINGS WE KNOW WHAT THE 

21:06:36 PROTOCOLS ARE TO FURTHER 

21:06:38 MINIMIZE ANY IMPACTS ON THAT.

21:06:43 SO THE MITIGATION MEASURES ARE 

21:06:45 QUITE LIGHT, IF YOU WILL, 

21:06:46 BECAUSE THERE ARE A LOT OF 

21:06:48 FREMONT STANDARD REQUIREMENTS 

21:06:50 THAT ARE ALREADY BASICALLY 

21:06:51 BUSINESS AS USUAL.

21:06:53 WE MAKE SURE TO PREVENT AIR 

21:06:57 QUALITY, BIOLOGICAL IMPACTS, 

21:06:58 CULTURAL RESOURCES.

21:07:00 SO BASICALLY THIS PROJECT 

21:07:01 DOESN'T HAVE A BIG SIGNIFICANT 

21:07:05 IMPACT ON THE ENVIRONMENT.

21:07:08 SO THE LAST SLIDE, BASICALLY, 

21:07:11 SHOWS THAT SINCE WE'VE DONE ALL 

21:07:13 THIS OUTREACH I THAT I TAKE IT 

21:07:15 TO BE A SIGN OF SUCCESS THAT WE 

21:07:16 DID NOT RECEIVE A LOT OF PUBLIC 

21:07:18 COMMENTS, EVEN THOUGH WE DID 

21:07:20 EXTENSIVE NOTIFICATIONS THROUGH 

21:07:22 POST CARDS, E-MAILS, NEWSLETTER 

21:07:23 ANNOUNCEMENTS.

21:07:25 AND SO WE ONLY ACTUALLY RECEIVED 

21:07:26 FIVE COMMENTS.

21:07:28 THREE OF THOSE BEING AGENCY 

21:07:29 MEMBERS.

21:07:33 BART, ALAMEDA COUNTY, BOTH WERE 

21:07:34 VERY CONCERNED, NOT VERY 

21:07:35 CONCERNED.

21:07:36 THEY WERE ACTUALLY PROACTIVELY 

21:07:38 MAKING SURE WE WERE AWARE OF 

21:07:40 THEIR FACILITIES AND HOW THEY 

21:07:41 WOULD LIKE TO BE INTEGRATED INTO 

21:07:43 THE FINAL DESIGNS SECTIONS.

21:07:45 AND THEN THE SAN FRANCISCO 

21:07:47 REGIONAL WATER QUALITY CONTROL 

21:07:48 BOARD.

21:07:50 THEIR ONLY ISSUE IS THAT THERE 

21:07:56 IS A MITIGATION SITE EAST OF 

21:07:59 I-680 THAT WE GONE TO GREAT 

21:08:02 PAINS TO AVOID BUT A SMALL 

21:08:03 CONSTRUCTION IMPACT MAY OCCUR.

21:08:05 IT'S A TEMPORARY IMPACT AND WE 

21:08:06 HAVE IN THERE ADEQUATE MEASURES 

21:08:09 THAT DID INDEED SATISFY THE 

21:08:11 WATER QUALITY CONTROL BOARD.

21:08:12 SO WE HAVE THEIR AGREEMENT AS 

21:08:15 WELL.

21:08:20 AND MR. TONG EXPRESSED A LITTLE 

21:08:22 OPPOSITION TO THE PROJECT 

21:08:31 WHEREAS NATALIA EXPRESSED 

21:08:33 CONCERN, ALIGNMENT TO GO OUT OF 

21:08:35 THE NATIVE TREES, STAY OUT OF 

21:08:37 THE RIPARIAN AREAS AND WE 

21:08:39 DEFINITELY HAVE KEPT WILDLIFE AS 

21:08:40 PART OF OUR VISION.

21:08:42 SO THAT CONCLUDES THE PUBLIC 

21:08:45 OUTREACH PIECE.

21:08:47 >> Hans Larsen:   THANK YOU 

21:08:47 JODI.

21:08:50 I WANT TO TOUCH ON THE ASPECTS 

21:08:52 OF THE PLANNING THAT'S BEEN DONE 

21:08:54 AS A COMPLEMENT TO THE PROJECT.

21:08:56 AND THAT IS SO THE GRANT THAT WE 

21:08:58 RECEIVED HAS FUNDS TO DO WORK ON 

21:09:00 PLANNING AND FOSSIL MUSEUM.

21:09:02 AND THIS AREA HAS AN ABSOLUTELY 

21:09:05 JUST EXTRAORDINARY AMOUNT OF 

21:09:06 HISTORY.

21:09:11 AND WORKING TOGETHER WITH THE 

21:09:13 MATH SCIENCE NUCLEUS, WE HAVE 

21:09:15 DEVELOPED SOME CONCEPTS FOR THE 

21:09:19 MUSEUM.

21:09:23 AND WANTED TO SHARE THAT WITH 

21:09:23 YOU ALL.

21:09:26 INCLUDES A 40,000 SQUARE FOOT 

21:09:27 BUILDING AND 90 PARKING SPACES.

21:09:31 AND IF THIS GETS DEVELOPED IT 

21:09:32 WOULD BE A PARTNERSHIP WITH 

21:09:34 MULTIPLE AGENCIES INCLUDING U.C. 

21:09:36 BERKELEY, THERE'S INTEREST ALSO 

21:09:38 AT THE STATE AND POTENTIALLY 

21:09:39 NATIONAL LEVEL.

21:09:41 SO THIS IS A VIEW OF THE 

21:09:43 PROPOSAL FOR THE MUSEUM, LOCATED 

21:09:46 ON THE CALTRANS PROPERTY, SO IT 

21:09:51 WOULD OVERLOOK 680 AND MORE 

21:09:52 IMPORTANTLY, THE FUTURE OR THE 

21:09:53 SITE WHERE THE FOSSILS WERE 

21:09:55 ACTUALLY ORIGINALLY UNCOVERED 

21:09:56 FROM.

21:09:57 AGAIN, THIS IS NOT PART OF THE 

21:09:59 TRAIL OR ENVIRONMENTAL CLEARANCE 

21:10:01 TONIGHT BUT IT IS PART OF A 

21:10:03 PARALLEL PLANNING EFFORT THAT 

21:10:05 WE'RE ENGAGED IN.

21:10:07 AND SO THE BRIDGE, THOUGH, IS 

21:10:09 PART OF THE EFFORT.

21:10:10 AND THE BRIDGE HAS BEEN DESIGNED 

21:10:14 TO REALLY CELEBRATE SORT OF THE 

21:10:17 FOSSIL CONTEXT OF THE AREA.

21:10:19 AND SO IF SOMEBODY'S ALONG THE 

21:10:21 TRAIL YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO WALK 

21:10:22 THROUGH THIS EXPERIENCE AND SORT 

21:10:23 OF SVELTE LIKE YOU WERE GOING 

21:10:25 THROUGH A FOSSIL STRUCTURE.

21:10:26 THIS CONCEPT IS SOMETHING THAT 

21:10:27 WAS DEVELOPED THROUGH THE 

21:10:30 COMMUNITY OUTREACH PROCESS.

21:10:32 AND THE COMMUNITY IS VERY 

21:10:33 INTERESTED IN HAVING SOMETHING 

21:10:35 THAT REALLY REFLECTED THE 

21:10:40 CONTEXT OF THE AREA.

21:10:42 WANTED TO ALSO TOUCH UPON ONE OF 

21:10:43 THE KEY ISSUES THAT WAS RAISED 

21:10:45 ABOUT THE SUITABILITY OF THE 

21:10:46 EXISTING TRAIL.

21:10:48 AND IT'S RECOGNIZED THAT THE 

21:10:51 EXISTING TRAIL IS NARROW IN, 

21:10:52 PARTS.

21:10:54 WE'RE OPENING IT UP TO ACCESS TO 

21:10:55 MORE PARTS OF THE FREMONT 

21:10:55 COMMUNITY.

21:10:57 THERE IS A NEED TO UPGRADE IT 

21:10:59 AND ALSO MANAGE IT IN A WAY THAT 

21:11:01 CAN BE USED BY ALL USERS SO 

21:11:03 PEOPLE BIKING AND WALKING.

21:11:05 AND SO THERE IS A PLAN TO WIDEN 

21:11:05 THIS.

21:11:07 AND PART OF OUR ACTION TONIGHT 

21:11:09 IS TO ALLOCATE FUNDS TO MOVE 

21:11:11 FORWARD WITH PLANNING UPGRADES 

21:11:12 TO THE EXISTING TRAIL.

21:11:15 AS I MENTIONED AT THE ONSET WE 

21:11:17 WOULD LIKE TO ALSO EXPAND THE 

21:11:19 TRAIL TO THE EAST AND THE WEST 

21:11:22 TO PROVIDE MORE CONNECTIVITY OF 

21:11:23 THE TRAIL.

21:11:25 AND WE THINK THIS IS VERY 

21:11:28 IMPORTANT IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO 

21:11:29 CAPTURE GRANT FUNDS, 

21:11:31 PARTICULARLY IF THE PROJECT HAS 

21:11:33 A CONNECTION ALL THE WAY FROM 

21:11:36 CENTRAL PARK THROUGH IRVINGTON, 

21:11:38 TO OHLONE COLLEGE, AND THE 

21:11:39 MISSION PEAK TRAILS.

21:11:43 AND SO JUST A FINAL SLIDE IS 

21:11:44 JUST A RECAP OF OUR 

21:11:45 RECOMMENDATIONS.

21:11:48 AND SO THE ACTION HERE TONIGHT 

21:11:50 IS, FIRST, TO CONVENE A PUBLIC 

21:11:52 HEARING AS PART OF THE APPROVAL 

21:11:55 PROCESS, TO APPROVE THE 

21:11:56 ENVIRONMENTAL DOCUMENT WHICH 

21:12:00 INCLUDES ADOPTING A DRAFT 

21:12:01 MITIGATED NEGATIVE DECLARATION, 

21:12:04 AND A MITIGATION MONITORING AND 

21:12:05 REPORTING PROGRAM.

21:12:07 AND I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT WE 

21:12:08 HAVE ISSUED A GREEN SHEET ON 

21:12:10 THIS PROJECT THAT INCLUDES THE 

21:12:13 UPDATED PLANS THAT REFLECT THE 

21:12:14 MOST RECENT COMMENTS THAT WE 

21:12:15 RECEIVED DURING THE 

21:12:17 ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW PROCESS.

21:12:21 SO YOU WOULD BE APPROVING THE 

21:12:22 EXHIBITS THAT ARE PART OF THE 

21:12:22 GREEN SHEET.

21:12:24 AND THEN THE SUPPLEMENTAL ACTION 

21:12:26 IS TO APPROVE FUNDING THAT WOULD 

21:12:29 ALLOW US TO DO ENHANCEMENTS AND 

21:12:31 EXPANSIONS OF THE TRAIL BEYOND 

21:12:32 THE PROJECT THAT'S THE SUBJECT 

21:12:34 OF ACTION HERE TONIGHT.

21:12:37 AND SO IF THAT IS APPROVED, WHAT 

21:12:38 STAFF WILL DO IS WE'LL CONTINUE 

21:12:40 PLANNING FOR FOSSIL MUSEUM, 

21:12:42 WE'LL PREPARE FINAL DESIGN FOR 

21:12:44 THE TRAIL PROJECT, INCLUDING THE 

21:12:46 BRIDGE OVER 680 WHICH IS FUNDED 

21:12:50 BY THE GRANT, AND THEN ALSO WE 

21:12:54 WILL SEEK CONSTRUCTION FUNDING, 

21:12:55 HOPEFULLY FINGERS CROSSED THAT 

21:12:57 MONEYS ARE AVAILABLE AT THE 

21:12:58 REGIONAL, STATE AND FEDERAL 

21:13:00 LEVEL, WE'LL BE ABLE TO ATTRACT 

21:13:04 TO WHAT WE THINK IS A WONDERFUL 

21:13:04 PROJECTION.

21:13:05 THAT IS THE END OF OUR 

21:13:06 PRESENTATION.

21:13:07 HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS 

21:13:08 YOU HAVE.

21:13:10 I'LL JUST CLOSE IT, THE STAFF 

21:13:12 THAT ARE AVAILABLE PROBABLY 

21:13:16 MYSELF AND JODI WILL HANDLE THEM 

21:13:18 AND WE DO HAVE OTHER STAFF 

21:13:19 AVAILABLE AS NEEDED.

21:13:20 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

21:13:22 AT THIS TIME I'LL FIRST TURN IT 

21:13:23 TO COUNCILMEMBERS FOR CLARIFYING 

21:13:27 QUESTIONS.

21:13:29 OKAY.

21:13:30 >> CAN WE TAKE THE SCREEN SHARE 

21:13:31 DOWN PLEASE?

21:13:33 >> Mayor Mei:   YES, PLEASE.

21:13:35 THANK YOU.

21:13:37 OKAY AND THEN I SEE NONE AT THIS 

21:13:38 MOMENT.

21:13:40 I'M GOING TO TURN IT -- AND OPEN 

21:13:41 THE PUBLIC HEARING.

21:13:43 AND SO THOSE WHO ARE WISHING TO 

21:13:45 SPEAK ON THIS ITEM UNDER PUBLIC 

21:13:47 HEARING IF YOU COULD EITHER 

21:13:50 PRESS THE RAISE HAND ICON OR IF 

21:13:55 YOU COULD PRESS STAR 9 IF YOU 

21:13:55 ARE DIALING IN.

21:13:57 I SEE COUPLE SPEAKERS.

21:13:58 WE'LL BEGIN WITH THE CALLER WITH 

21:14:01 THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING IN 365.

21:14:06 WELCOME.

21:14:16 >> HI, THIS IS ALICE CAVETTE.

21:14:18 WE ARE TOTALLY AGAINST THE 

21:14:20 BRIDGE TO SABERCAT TRAIL.

21:14:22 IT IS A TIME WHEN AGING 

21:14:25 INFRASTRUCTURE AND MASS TRANSIT 

21:14:26 NEED OUR TAX DOLLARS.

21:14:28 I STRONGLY FEEL FREMONT SHOULD 

21:14:30 NOT USE FUNDS TO BUILD A 

21:14:33 RECREATIONAL BRIDGE OVER 680, 

21:14:35 ESPECIALLY AT A SPOT SO CLOSE TO 

21:14:40 AN EARTHQUAKE FAULT.

21:14:43 JUST BECAUSE SOMEONE CAN AFFORD 

21:14:44 SOME DOESN'T MEAN THEY SHOULD 

21:14:45 BUY IT.

21:14:48 IT IS PROBABLY FUTILE TO SPEAK 

21:14:50 UP AGAIN NOW THAT FREMONT HAS 

21:14:51 USED STATE GRANT TO FUND THE 

21:14:54 STUDIES.

21:14:56 WE DO SUPPORT THE FOSSIL MUSEUM 

21:14:58 BUT LET'S FIND ANOTHER WAY TO 

21:14:59 FUND IT.

21:15:01 STOP THIS BRIDGE PROJECT NOW.

21:15:08 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU ALICE.

21:15:10 NEXT SPEAKER IS JANE.

21:15:11 WELCOME.

21:15:18 >> HI, THANK YOU FOR THE 

21:15:20 OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK.

21:15:24 SO I AM WONDERING, HOW DOES THE 

21:15:26 PROJECT ADDRESS FUTURE 

21:15:29 MAINTENANCE AND SAFETY CONCERNS 

21:15:30 NEAR THE TRAIL PROJECT AREAS.

21:15:32 WE ALL KNOW THAT WHEN YOU 

21:15:35 CONNECT A TRAIL NEXT TO A BART 

21:15:37 STATION, IT'S LIKELY GOING TO 

21:15:40 BRING DOWN MORE TRANSIENTS WHO 

21:15:43 RELY ON TRAILS TO REACH THE 

21:15:44 NEIGHBORHOODS.

21:15:46 SO HOW ARE YOU GOING TO ADDRESS 

21:15:47 THE COMMUNITY SAFETY ISSUE 

21:15:50 AROUND THAT?

21:15:51 CITY OF SAN JOSE HAS SOME SORT 

21:15:53 OF A TRAIL SAFETY PLAN TO 

21:15:56 ADDRESS THE COMMUNITY'S 

21:15:56 CONCERNS.

21:15:59 BASED ON THE COUNCILMEMBERS 

21:15:59 REQUEST.

21:16:02 SO IS THE CITY OF FREMONT ALSO 

21:16:06  

21:16:08 GOING TO HAVE A TRAIL SAFETY 

21:16:10 PLAN TO GO ALONG WITH THIS TO 

21:16:11 MAINTAIN THE NEIGHBORHOOD SAFETY 

21:16:14 AND THE CLEANLINESS OF THE AREA 

21:16:16 AND TO PREVENT HOMELESSNESS NEXT 

21:16:16 TO THE CREEKS.

21:16:20 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

21:16:23 NEXT SPEAKER, WILLIAM ARUGI.

21:16:25 WELCOME.

21:16:30 >> YES, THANK YOU, WILLIAM ARUGI 

21:16:33 MISSION PEAK CONSERVANCY.

21:16:35 JUST WANTED TO SAY WE'RE FULLY 

21:16:36 SUPPORTIVE OF THIS PROJECT.

21:16:38 THE BRIDGE WILL WHEN COMPLETED 

21:16:40 PROVIDE CONNECTIVELY TO THE BART 

21:16:44  CONNECTIVITY TO THE BART 

21:16:46 STATION, ALLOW COMMUTERS FROM 

21:16:47 THE MISSION NEIGHBORHOOD TO 

21:16:48 ACCESSING BART WITHOUT A CAR 

21:16:50 WHICH IS FANTASTIC.

21:16:52 WE WOULD ASK THAT MORE PARKING 

21:16:56 BE AVAILABLE, SPECIFICALLY ON 

21:16:58 THE MISSION HILLS SIDE OF THE 

21:17:00 NEIGHBORHOOD IN ORDER TO PROVIDE 

21:17:02 LESS CONFLICT WITH THE 

21:17:02 NEIGHBORS.

21:17:04 BUT THIS WOULD BE A BEAUTIFUL 

21:17:06 TRAIL HEAD AND IT WILL BE A 

21:17:07 FANTASTIC EXTENSION TO AN 

21:17:10 EXISTING TRAIL THAT I FREQUENTLY 

21:17:11 USE.

21:17:11 SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

21:17:15 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

21:17:17 AND THE NEXT SPEAKER IS 

21:17:20 KATHERINE RUBY.

21:17:20 WELCOME.

21:17:25 >> HI, THANK YOU SO MUCH.

21:17:27 THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I'VE 

21:17:27 ACTUALLY HEARD ABOUT THIS 

21:17:28 PROJECT.

21:17:30 BUT FROM WHAT I CAN SEE IT LOOKS 

21:17:32 LIKE A FANTASTIC IDEA.

21:17:35 I DON'T SEE ANY FORESEEABLE 

21:17:37 PROBLEMS WITH IT AT THIS TIME.

21:17:39 AND I THINK THE BRIDGE LOOKS 

21:17:40 REALLY COOL.

21:17:42 I AM ALSO IN SUPPORT OF THE 

21:17:46 FOSSIL MUSEUM AND WOULD LIKE TO 

21:17:48 ENCOURAGE, IF THERE IS AN 

21:17:53 INTEREST IN THIS, NATIVE AND OR 

21:17:55 INDIGENOUS INTEREST OR SPACE IN 

21:18:00 THAT FOSSIL MUSEUM FOR ANYTHING 

21:18:02 RELEVANT TO THEM AS WELL.

21:18:07 I THINK IT JUST SOUNDS LIKE A 

21:18:08 GREAT IDEA.

21:18:13 I AM CONCERNED THAT PEOPLE STILL 

21:18:15 FIND THAT HOMELESSNESS IS AN 

21:18:18 ISSUE AROUND SUCH THINGS.

21:18:21 AND I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SUGGEST 

21:18:25 THAT WE'RE WORKING ON THIS.

21:18:26 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

21:18:33 THE NEXT SPEAKER IS FLAVIO.

21:18:38 >> HELLO, THIS IS FLAVIO PRIMON.

21:18:40 I JUST WANTED TO EXPRESS MY 

21:18:42 SUPPORT FOR THIS PROJECT.

21:18:44 IT'S FINE TO SEE THE TRAILS 

21:18:46 GETTING INTERCONNECTED.

21:18:49 THE TRAIL CONNECTED TO CENTRAL 

21:18:52 PARK, CONNECTED TO TRANSIT SO 

21:18:55 ALL IN ALL I'M VERY EXCITED WITH 

21:18:57 THIS IDEA AND FULLY SUPPORT IT, 

21:18:58 THANK YOU.

21:18:59 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

21:19:04 AND THE NEXT SPEAKER IS ANDREAS 

21:19:08 CADAVANEK.

21:19:15 >> THANK YOU, ANDREAS CADAVANEK 

21:19:16 WITH BIKE FREMONT.

21:19:18 WE'RE PLEASED TO HEAR THAT THE 

21:19:20 CITY IS ACTUALLY LOOKING AT 

21:19:22 EXTENDING THIS ACTIVE 

21:19:24 TRANSPORTATION TRAIL ALL THE WAY 

21:19:25 TO MISSION SAN JOSE AREA AND TO 

21:19:26 OHLONE COLLEGE AND WE'RE REALLY 

21:19:28 LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING THE 

21:19:30 DESIGNS AND GIVING INPUT TO MAKE 

21:19:32 THIS A SUCCESSFUL TRAIL PROJECT.

21:19:58 THANK YOU.

21:19:58 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

21:19:58 THE NEXT SPEAKER IS DINA 

21:19:58 DESPONDE.

21:19:59 THANK YOU.

21:19:59 >> HI, THIS IS A VERY EXCITING 

21:19:59 PROJECT.

21:19:59 LIKE I BELIEVE I'VE BEEN ON THE 

21:19:59 TRAIL A FEW TIMES AND THE CELL 

21:19:59 PHONE SIGNAL DOESN'T WORK THERE 

21:19:59 AND THAT TO ME IS A LITTLE BIT 

21:19:59 OF A SAFETY CONCERN SO I'M NOT 

21:20:00 SURE THAT'S BEING ACCOUNTED FOR.

21:20:04 AS PART OF THIS PROGRAM AND ALSO 

21:20:07 LOOKING AT HOW THIS HAS -- THERE 

21:20:09 ARE A LOT OF RANDOM REPORTS OF 

21:20:12 HOMELESS ISSUES ON TRAILS AND 

21:20:13 PEOPLE UNSETTLED THERE.

21:20:15 AND ESPECIALLY MENTALLY ILL 

21:20:17 PEOPLE AROUND THOSE AREAS.

21:20:20 SO JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT 

21:20:21 THERE'S A PROPER SAFETY 

21:20:24 PROTOCOLS PUT IN PLACE AND SURE 

21:20:26 THERE WILL BE SOMETHING WHEN YOU 

21:20:27 BUILD THIS PEOPLE ARE SCARED TO 

21:20:29 GO THERE SO APPRECIATE THAT 

21:20:30 CONSIDERATION.

21:20:31 THANK YOU.

21:20:33 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

21:20:35 I BELIEVE THAT IS THE LAST 

21:20:38 SPEAKER PUBLIC HEARING AND I'D 

21:20:39 LIKE TO CLOSE THE PUBLIC HEARING 

21:20:43 AT THIS TIME.

21:20:44 AND BRING IT BACK TO THE COUNCIL 

21:20:48 FOR COMMENTS.

21:20:50 I JUST WANTED TO ALSO NOTE REAL 

21:20:52 QUICKLY THAT WE HAVE HAD SOME 

21:20:54 VISITORS AND WE WERE ABLE TO 

21:20:57 GIVE A TOUR WITH SENATOR 

21:20:58 WIECKOWSKI.

21:21:04 AND ALSO, I KNOW I HAVE TO THANK 

21:21:05 COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN WHERE WE 

21:21:07 HAD TO WALK THE DIFFERENT 

21:21:08 DISTRICTS, THAT WAS THE AREA 

21:21:09 THAT HE PICKED TO WALK.

21:21:11 IT WAS A GREAT WAY FOR PEOPLE 

21:21:13 WHO HAVE NEVER HAD A CHANCE TO 

21:21:14 EXPERIENCE THE TRAIL TO BE ABLE 

21:21:16 TO WALK AND SEE THE BEAUTY 

21:21:18 THAT'S THERE.

21:21:19 COUNCILMEMBER SHAO.

21:21:19 >> Councilmember Shao:   THANK 

21:21:20 YOU, MADAM MAYOR.

21:21:24 I HEARD SOME CONCERNS ABOUT 

21:21:25 PUBLIC SAFETY FOR THIS TRAIL 

21:21:26 PROJECT.

21:21:29 I HAVE WALKED THE TRAILS MYSELF 

21:21:33 AND I ALSO UNDERSTOOD THE PAST 

21:21:36 WHERE THERE WAS SOME ENCAMPMENT 

21:21:37 ISSUES.

21:21:39 BUT RIGHT NOW, THAT ISSUE IS NO 

21:21:40 LONGER THERE.

21:21:48 AND I BELIEVE THAT BY WINDING 

21:21:50 THE TRAILS AND CONNECTING THE 

21:21:51 TRAIMS MORE TRAFFIC WOULD 

21:21:54 TYPICALLY MAKE THE ENCAMPMENT 

21:21:56 ISSUE LESS SERIOUS.

21:21:58 BOUGHT TYPICALLY, UNHOUSED 

21:22:03 POPULATIONS TEND TO CAMP OUTSIDE 

21:22:04 THE ACTIVITIES OF THE 

21:22:04 NEIGHBORHOOD.

21:22:09 HAVING SAID THAT, I STILL 

21:22:12 BELIEVE IT IS WORTH OUR WHILE IN 

21:22:15 OUR PLANNING PERIOD TO GET THE 

21:22:16 FREMONT POLICE DEPARTMENT 

21:22:20 INVOLVED, TO IN GENERAL LOOK AT 

21:22:24 THE SITUATION IN ALL THE CITY 

21:22:25 TRAILS.

21:22:29 NOT ONLY LIMITED TO THIS PENDING 

21:22:31 PROJECT SO THAT WE CAN HAVE SOME 

21:22:32 IDEA AND ALSO SOME INFORMATION 

21:22:35 TO SHARE WITH THE PUBLIC ABOUT 

21:22:38 THE IMPROVEMENT OF PUBLIC SAFETY 

21:22:40 BY COMPLETING THOSE TRAIL 

21:22:43 PROJECTS.

21:22:44 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

21:22:51 I SEE ALSO VICE MAYOR SALWAN.

21:22:52 >> Councilmember Salwan:   YES, 

21:22:54 I'D LIKE TO SEE THAT SABERCAT IS 

21:22:56 ONE OF THE BEST KEPT SECRETS OF 

21:22:57 FREMONT.

21:22:58 SO HOPEFULLY IT WON'T BE A BIG 

21:23:01 SECRET AFTER WE GET THIS PROJECT 

21:23:03 GOING.

21:23:04 SO YEAH, I THINK, YOU KNOW, 

21:23:06 SAFETY IS'S IMPORTANT AND I HOPE 

21:23:07 STAFF WILL TAKE THAT INTO 

21:23:09 CONSIDERATION AND SEE HOW WE CAN 

21:23:11 TRY TO MAKE IT SAFE FOR 

21:23:11 EVERYONE.

21:23:17 BESIDES THAT I'M READY TO MAKE A 

21:23:18 MOTION TO SUPPORT THIS.

21:23:20 AT THE RIGHT MOMENT.

21:23:21 >> Mayor Mei:   I'M VERY 

21:23:21 SUPPORTIVE.

21:23:24 I ALSO WANTED TO MENTION I 

21:23:28 WANTED TO THANK SECRETARY WADE 

21:23:31 CRAWFOOT FOR COMING OUT ON THE 

21:23:31 TOUR.

21:23:35 I'M VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THAT.

21:23:36 COUNCILMEMBER KENG.

21:23:37 >> Councilmember Keng:   I HAVE 

21:23:38 A QUICK QUESTION.

21:23:40 IS THE 5.6 MILLION THE TOTAL 

21:23:41 COST OF THE PROJECT?

21:23:45 WHAT IS THE TOTAL COST AGAIN?

21:23:47 >> Hans Larsen:   SO THE -- SO 

21:23:49 COUNCILMEMBER KENG, SO THAT THE 

21:23:51 GRANT COVERS SORT OF THE 

21:23:52 PLANNING, ENVIRONMENTAL 

21:23:54 CLEARANCE AND THE DESIGN OF THE 

21:23:56 PROJECT TO GET IT TO A POINT 

21:23:58 WHERE IT'S SHOVEL-READY FOR 

21:24:01 CONSTRUCTION.

21:24:03 THE -- ALL OF THE ELEMENTS OF 

21:24:04 THE PROJECT THAT ARE DESCRIBED, 

21:24:07 SO THE BRIDGE OVER 680, A NEW 

21:24:12 BRIDGE OVER THE BART TRACKS, AND 

21:24:13 THE RAILROAD TRACKS TO GET INTO 

21:24:15 THE CENTERVILLE COMMUNITY.

21:24:16 AND THEN THE NORTH TRAIL.

21:24:18 ALL OF THAT COMBINED SORT OF THE 

21:24:20 FULL COST IS ROUGHLY $75 

21:24:21 MILLION.

21:24:22 THAT INCLUDES THE PLANNING AND 

21:24:25 DESIGN WORK.

21:24:27 SO THERE ARE THREE DISTINCT 

21:24:28 ELEMENTS TO IT.

21:24:30 IT'S POSSIBLE TO PHASE PORTIONS 

21:24:33 OF IT TO WORK WITH AVAILABILITY 

21:24:34 OF MONEY.

21:24:36 BUT JUST A QUICK ANSWER TO YOUR 

21:24:39 QUESTION, THE OVERALL PACKAGE IS 

21:24:42 APPROXIMATELY $75 MILLION.

21:24:43 >> Councilmember Keng:   AND HOW 

21:24:48 MUCH OF THAT HAVE WE ALLOCATED, 

21:24:51 HAVE WE RECEIVED FUNDING FOR 

21:24:51 OR --

21:24:52 >> Hans Larsen:   SO THE FUNDING 

21:24:55 COVERS THE DESIGN WHICH IS 

21:24:57 APPROXIMATELY $6 MILLION.

21:25:02 SO THE REMAINDER IS SORT OF A 

21:25:04 LITTLE LESS THAN $70 MILLION, 

21:25:07 WOULD BE THE FUNDS THAT WOULD BE 

21:25:10 NEEDED TO SECURE CONSTRUCTION.

21:25:14 I KNOW THAT IS A BIG NUMBER.

21:25:16 CERTAINLY IT'S VERY COSTLY TO 

21:25:18 GET OVER A FREEWAY, AS WELL AS 

21:25:20 THE RAILROAD TRACKS AND SO 

21:25:22 THAT'S A BIG COMPONENT OF THOSE 

21:25:22 COSTS.

21:25:25 BUT THE GOOD THING IS WITH THE 

21:25:27 AVAILABILITY OF MONEY AT BOTH 

21:25:29 THE STATE AND PARTICULARLY THE 

21:25:32 FEDERAL LEVELS, THIS IS A 

21:25:34 PROJECT THAT'S WITHIN REACH, AND 

21:25:39 THERE IS VERY MUCH AN 

21:25:40 ORIENTATION TO CONNECT 

21:25:43 COMMUNITIES, TO BUILD MULTIMODAL 

21:25:45 TRANSPORTATION, BUILD RECREATION 

21:25:46 FACILITIES.

21:25:47 AND SO WE THINK THAT THIS 

21:25:49 PROJECT WILL BE VERY COMPETITIVE 

21:25:52 FOR GRANTS FROM OTHER SOURCES.

21:25:53 >> Councilmember Keng:   I SEE.

21:25:55 SO WE HAVE THE FUNDING FOR THE 

21:25:58 DESIGN PROCESS BUT WE HAVEN'T 

21:25:59 IDENTIFIED FUNDING FOR THE 

21:26:01 BUILDING ITSELF?

21:26:02 >> Hans Larsen:   THAT'S 

21:26:02 CORRECT.

21:26:04 AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET 

21:26:06 FUNDING THROUGH STATE AND 

21:26:09 FEDERAL RESOURCES WILL BE COMING 

21:26:11 UP SHORTLY OVER THE NEXT YEAR, 

21:26:13 AND I THINK HAVING, IF YOU 

21:26:16 APPROVE THIS TONIGHT, HAVING 

21:26:17 ENVIRONMENTAL CLEARANCE REALLY 

21:26:21 GETS US TO A POINT OF HIGH STATE 

21:26:23 OF READINESS WHICH WE THINK WILL 

21:26:24 ALLOW US TO BE VERY COMPETITIVE 

21:26:26 FOR FUTURE FUNDING ALLOCATIONS.

21:26:28 >> Councilmember Keng:   I SEE, 

21:26:31 OKAY, YEAH, I'M SUPPORTIVE OF 

21:26:32 THE MUSEUM.

21:26:34 I THINK IT'S -- WE WERE PART OF 

21:26:37 THE TOUR WHEN SENATOR WIECKOWSKI 

21:26:40 WAS HERE, WITH SOME OF THE STATE 

21:26:40 AGENCY FOLKS.

21:26:42 SO I THINK, YOU KNOW, FREMONT 

21:26:45 DOES NEED MORE OF THESE 

21:26:47 RECREATIONAL YOU KNOW LIKE KIND 

21:26:50 OF DESTINATIONS, WE DON'T JUST 

21:26:52 HAVE MISSION PEAK, PROBABLY ONE 

21:26:54 OF THE FEW ATTRACTIONS BESIDES 

21:26:57 THE NILES DOWNTOWN AND COUPLE 

21:26:58 OTHER SPOTS.

21:27:00 SO YEAH, VERY EXCITING.

21:27:02 THANK YOU.

21:27:05 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

21:27:05 COUNCILMEMBER JONES, I SAW YOU 

21:27:07 TRYING TO RAISE YOUR HAND.

21:27:09 BECAUSE I HAVE SOME OTHER 

21:27:11 COMMENTS IF YOU ARE --

21:27:12 >> Councilmember Jones:   NO.

21:27:13 >> Mayor Mei:   OKAY, I SAW YOUR 

21:27:15 HANDS ON THE SCREEN.

21:27:16 COUNCILMEMBER COX, DO YOU HAVE 

21:27:16 COMMENTS?

21:27:18 I HAVE SOME OTHER COMMENTS TO 

21:27:20 MAKE BEFORE WE MAKE THE VOTE.

21:27:20 >> Councilmember Cox:   YES.

21:27:23 I THINK THIS IS A WONDERFUL 

21:27:23 PROJECT.

21:27:26 AND THANK YOU HANS AND TEAM FOR 

21:27:27 PULLING THIS TOGETHER AND 

21:27:31 PRESENTING IT TONIGHT.

21:27:33 EXCITED ABOUT BRIDGING OUR 

21:27:34 DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES TOGETHER 

21:27:37 FOR FUN, RELAXATION, LIVE, WORK 

21:27:40 AND PLAY IN FREMONT HERE.

21:27:41 ONE OF THE QUESTIONS I JUST 

21:27:44 WANTED TO MAKE SURE IS CLEAR, IS 

21:27:46 THAT I SAW THAT THERE'S A 

21:27:49 MITIGATION AND MONITORING REPORT 

21:27:49 PROGRAM.

21:27:53 IS THAT $200,000 PART OF WHAT'S 

21:27:54 GOING TO BE USED FOR THAT AS 

21:27:56 WELL?

21:27:57 FOR DOING THAT?

21:27:59 OR IS THIS JUST INITIAL DESIGN 

21:28:01 AND THEN THERE'S OTHER COSTS 

21:28:03 ASSOCIATED WITH THIS MONITORING?

21:28:06 I WASN'T CLEAR ON THE PART OF 

21:28:08 WHAT WE'RE APPROVING TONIGHT FOR 

21:28:11 THE DOLLAR AMOUNT AND WHAT IT 

21:28:13 FULLY ENTAILS THERE.

21:28:14 >> Hans Larsen:   YES, SO LET ME 

21:28:17 JUST YEAH CLARIFY.

21:28:19 SO THE ACTIONS TONIGHT ARE 

21:28:21 APPROVAL OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL 

21:28:22 DOCUMENT WHICH INCLUDES THE 

21:28:25 MITIGATION AND MONITORING PLAN.

21:28:28 AND SO IF THE PROJECT IS FUNDED 

21:28:30 FOR CONSTRUCTION, THEN WE WOULD 

21:28:32 IMPLEMENT THE ELEMENTS OF THE 

21:28:32 MITIGATION PLAN.

21:28:35 SO ANY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH 

21:28:36 DOING THAT WOULD BE PART OF THE 

21:28:39 FUTURE CONSTRUCTION BUDGET.

21:28:43 THE $200,000 THAT WE'RE 

21:28:45 RECOMMENDING THAT YOU ALLOCATE 

21:28:48 TONIGHT ARE TO MOVE FORWARD WITH 

21:28:50 PLANNING TO ENHANCE THE PROPOSED 

21:28:50 PROJECT.

21:28:56 AND THAT WOULD INCLUDE CREATING 

21:28:58 THE EXISTING TRAIL AND THEN 

21:29:00 BEGINNING WORK TO EXPAND THE 

21:29:02 PROJECT IN ONE DIRECTION TOWARDS 

21:29:03 OHLONE COLLEGE AND IN THE 

21:29:04 WESTERN DIRECTION TOWARDS A 

21:29:06 CONNECTION WITH THE TRAIL AT 

21:29:08 CENTRAL PARK.

21:29:09 >> Councilmember Cox:   OKAY, 

21:29:09 THANK YOU.

21:29:13 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

21:29:15 I WAS JUST GOING TO SAY THAT 

21:29:18 OVER THE YEARS I KNOW WORKING 

21:29:25 WITH DR. FTC BLUKIRK AND HER 

21:29:31 EFFORTS IN TERMINATES OF THE 

21:29:33 FOSSILS, WE'VE ALSO TRIED IN THE 

21:29:35 PAST TO CREATE RESOURCE LIKE THE 

21:29:36 NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM OR MUSEUM 

21:29:38 FOR CHILDREN AND I THINK THIS 

21:29:39 WOULD BE AN EXCELLENT WAY TO 

21:29:41 SHOWCASE OUR OWN LEGACY AND 

21:29:43 HERITAGE AS WELL AS CONNECTING 

21:29:45 PEOPLE NOW MORE THAN EVER.

21:29:47 I NOW LOOKING AT THE SURVEYS 

21:29:52 WHETHERRISTS OUR MASTER PLAN OR 

21:29:54  

21:29:56 WHETHER IT'S OUR MASTER PLAN OR 

21:29:58 TRAIL PLANS, I ALSO WANTED TO 

21:29:59 CLARIFY HANS, I THINK THE GRANT 

21:30:04 THAT WE RECEIVED IT WAS NOT JUST 

21:30:04 GENERAL FUNDS BUT IT WAS 

21:30:06 SPECIFIC TO THIS PROJECT, IF I'M 

21:30:07 NOT CORRECT.

21:30:09 I WANTED TO CLARIFY THAT FOR THE 

21:30:09 PUBLIC.

21:30:10 >> Hans Larsen:   YES, THE WORK 

21:30:12 THAT WE'VE DONE TO PLAN AND 

21:30:14 PREPARE THE ENVIRONMENTAL 

21:30:15 CLEARANCE AS WELL AS FUTURE 

21:30:19 DESIGN IS ALL COMING FROM A 

21:30:20 STATE GRANT.

21:30:25 >> Mayor Mei:   RIGHT SO 
SEPARATE.

21:30:26 IT'S NOT SOMETHING WE COULD 

21:30:28 ALLOCATE ELSEWHERE.

21:30:28 >> Hans Larsen:   THAT'S 

21:30:29 CORRECT.

21:30:31 THE FUNDING WAS SPECIFICALLY 

21:30:33 TARGETED TOWARDS THIS FIRST 

21:30:34  

21:30:35 PURPOSE AND I THINK OF NOTE THE 

21:30:37 GRANT IS FROM THE CALIFORNIA 

21:30:39 NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY.

21:30:42 SO MANY TIMES PLANS LIKE THIS 

21:30:45 ARE PART OF A MOBILITY NETWORK 

21:30:47 BUT THIS GRANT THAT WE HAVE 

21:30:49 REALLY RECOGNIZES JUST THE 

21:30:52 FASCINATING NATURAL HISTORY AND 

21:30:55 THE FOSSIL HISTORY OF THE AREA.

21:30:57 >> Mayor Mei:   YES.

21:31:00 OKAY.

21:31:01 COUNCILMEMBER COX YOU HAVE YOUR 

21:31:03 HAND STILL UP.

21:31:04 >> Councilmember Cox:   OH SOME 

21:31:07 LET ME PUT IT DOWN.

21:31:08 >> Mayor Mei:   COUNCILMEMBER 

21:31:10 KENG DO YOU HAVE ANOTHER 

21:31:11 CLARIFYING QUESTION?

21:31:13 >> Councilmember Keng:   YES, 

21:31:14 I'M WONDERING CAN YOU IDENTIFY 

21:31:17 WHAT'S THE COST OF THE 680 

21:31:19 BRIDGE THAT CONNECTS THE TWO 

21:31:21 SIDES?

21:31:22 BECAUSE I AM A LITTLE BIT 

21:31:24 CONCERNED ABOUT THE COST, YOU 

21:31:27 KNOW WE'RE SPENDING $5 MILLION, 

21:31:29 $6 MILLION ON DESIGNING AND WE 

21:31:32 DON'T HAVE THE REST OF THE MONEY 

21:31:35 IDENTIFIED YET.

21:31:39 AND SO --

21:31:40 >> Hans Larsen:   LET'S SEE, I 

21:31:44 DON'T HAVE THE SORT OF EXACT 

21:31:45 NUMBERS OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD 

21:31:47 BUT I THINK THE BRIDGE OVER 680 

21:31:49 IS I WOULD SAY ORDER OF 

21:31:51 MAGNITUDE AROUND $40 MILLION.

21:31:54 AND THAT INCLUDES ALL OF THE 

21:31:55 TRAILS AND THE CONNECTING PIECES 

21:31:57 OF IT.

21:31:58 AND THEN THE BRIDGE OVER THE 

21:32:00 RAILROAD TRACKS AND BART TRACKS 

21:32:03 IS PROBABLY IN THE ORDER OF $20 

21:32:04 MILLION.

21:32:07 AND THEN THE NORTH TRAIL 

21:32:10 EXTENSION OF THE BART STATION IS 

21:32:12 IN THE ORDER OF PROBABLY FIVE TO 

21:32:13 $10 MILLION.

21:32:15 SO SOME ROUGH FIGURES THERE.

21:32:17 BUT CLEARLY YEAH, THE MOST 

21:32:19 EXPENSIVE PIECE IS BEING ABLE TO 

21:32:22 GET ACROSS, I THINK WE'VE GOT 

21:32:23 SIX LANES OF TRAFFIC OVER THE 

21:32:24 FREEWAY.

21:32:28 AND SO THOSE ARE QUITE 

21:32:29 EXPENSIVE.

21:32:29 >> Councilmember Keng:   THANK 

21:32:30 YOU.

21:32:31 SO, YOU KNOW, I WANT TO KIND OF 

21:32:34 HAVE A MORE COMPREHENSIVE LIKE 

21:32:36 ENHANCEMENT OF OUR CITY.

21:32:38 I KNOW THAT IF WE'RE SPENDING -- 

21:32:40 IF WE'RE PLANNING TO SPEND LIKE 

21:32:45 $75 MILLION, ON THIS ITEM, YOU 

21:32:49 KNOW, DO WE HAVE SOME LONG TERM 

21:32:52 PLANNING ON IMPROVEMENTS AND 

21:32:54 RECREATION PROGRAMS FOR THE 

21:32:56 NORTH SIDE OF TOWN?

21:32:58 YOU KNOW, BECAUSE IT'S STILL 

21:33:00 QUITE A WAYS FOR THE PEOPLE IN 

21:33:02 NORTH FREMONT TO GET TO SOUTH 

21:33:06 SIDE, SOUTH FREMONT.

21:33:09 AND I THINK IF WE'RE SPENDING 

21:33:10 THIS KIND OF MONEY ONE SIDE OF 

21:33:11 TOWN I THINK IT WOULD BE ONLY 

21:33:13 FAIR TO CONSIDER SPENDING A 

21:33:17 FRACTION OF THIS MONEY THAT 

21:33:18 BENEFITS NORTH FREMONT 

21:33:18 RESIDENTS.

21:33:22 >> Hans Larsen:   IF I COULD 

21:33:22 JUST CLARIFY.

21:33:26 I THINK OUR INTENT IS TO TRY TO 

21:33:29 CAPTURE MONEY FROM STATE, 

21:33:31 FEDERAL OR REGIONAL SOURCES, 

21:33:34 THAT'S GEARED TOWARDS TRAILS AND 

21:33:36 TRANSPORTATION.

21:33:40 AND SO I THINK THE -- WE'RE NOT 

21:33:43 ENVISIONING OR EXPECTING THAT A 

21:33:44 PROJECT OF THIS AMOUNT WOULD 

21:33:47 COME PURELY FROM CITY REVENUES.

21:33:48 THERE PROBABLY IS A SMALL 

21:33:49 MATCHING AMOUNT THAT WE WOULD 

21:33:54 NEED TO PROVIDE THAT WOULD COME 

21:33:56 FROM OUR TRANSPORTATION 

21:33:56 PROGRAMS.

21:33:59 BUT YEAH, THIS WOULD NOT BE -- 

21:34:00 CERTAINLY WOULD NOT BE SOMETHING 

21:34:02 THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO AFFORD 

21:34:04 OR WOULD COME OUT OF THE CITY 

21:34:07 GENERAL FUND, THAT COULD COMPETE 

21:34:08 WITH OTHER NEEDS THAT WE HAVE 

21:34:10 ACROSS THE CITY.

21:34:11 >> Councilmember Keng:   YEAH, 

21:34:14 YEAH, THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT, 

21:34:15 AS A CITY WE DON'T HAVE THE 

21:34:17 CAPACITY TO BUILD SOMETHING LIKE 

21:34:18 THIS BUT, YOU KNOW, WHAT I'M 

21:34:23 SAYING IS IF WE ARE, YOU KNOW, 

21:34:24 HAVING ENHANCEMENTS AND PROGRAMS 

21:34:27 FOR THE SOUTH SIDE OF TOWN, DO 

21:34:29 WE HAVE OTHER JUST KIND OF A 

21:34:31 SIDE QUESTION, DO WE HAVE OTHER 

21:34:33 PROGRAMS THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT 

21:34:37  

21:34:38 ON THE NORTH SIDE.

21:34:40 >> Mayor Mei:   WELL I THINK 

21:34:42 TOMORROW AND IN THE UPCOMING 

21:34:46 WEEKS WE'RE UPDATING OUR MASTER 

21:34:49 PLAN.

21:34:50 OUR PARKS AND TRAILS MASTER 

21:34:50 PLAN.

21:34:52 AND HOPEFULLY WILL BE ABLE TO 

21:34:53 ADDRESS WITH THAT INCORPORATED 

21:34:56 MORE OF THE OVERVIEW OF THE 

21:34:58 ATLAS AND HOW WE COULD HAVE 

21:35:00 EQUITY AND WE DID A STUDY OF ALL 

21:35:02 THE PARKS AND RESOURCES AND 

21:35:04 DETAILED SURVEYS AND HOPEFULLY 

21:35:06 PEOPLE WILL TUNE IN FOR THAT AS 

21:35:07 WE LOOK AT THE DIFFERENT 

21:35:08 RESOURCES.

21:35:09 THIS ONE I AGREE THAT I 

21:35:11 DEFINITELY WOULD BE -- PART OF 

21:35:13 IT IS JUST SETTING THE 

21:35:15 FOUNDATION FOR ENVIRONMENTAL 

21:35:16 IMPACT RESOURCE TO STUDY THAT.

21:35:18 AND THEN IN THIS MOMENT RIGHT 

21:35:21 NOW WHERE THERE IS 

21:35:22 TRANSFORMATIONAL FUNDING THAT'S 

21:35:23 BEING GIVEN TO SOME OF THESE 

21:35:25 INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS AND WITH 

21:35:28 THE SUPPORT OF SECRETARY 

21:35:29 CROWFOOT, WE'RE VERY HAPPY THAT 

21:35:32 HE COULD COME AND SEE FIRSTHAND 

21:35:34 IT'S DIFFERENT THAN A PROPOSAL, 

21:35:37 TO SECURE OUTSIDE FUNDING TO BE 

21:35:38 ABLE TO MARRY TOGETHER TO MAKE 

21:35:41 THAT FUNDING MATCH.

21:35:43 BUT ABSOLUTELY WE ARE CONCERNED 

21:35:44 ABOUT ALL PARTS OF THE DISTRICT 

21:35:45 AND AS WE TALKED ABOUT 

21:35:47 REDISTRICTING IN OTHER AREAS, 

21:35:49 HOPEFULLY PEOPLE WILL JOIN US, 

21:35:51 IT'S A TEASER HOPEFULLY TO JOIN 

21:35:52 US FOR THE MASTER PLAN 

21:35:53 DISCUSSION WHICH WILL BE COME 

21:35:55 PICKUP.

21:35:56 >> Hans Larsen:   MAYOR MEI, IF 

21:36:00 I COULD ADD IN TERMS OF OTHER 

21:36:01 INVESTMENTS WE'RE LOOKING AT, 

21:36:02 PARTICULARLY TRYING TO LEVERAGE 

21:36:04 MONEYS AT THE STATE AND FEDERAL 

21:36:04 LEVEL.

21:36:08 AS PART OF THE TRAIL MASTER PLAN 

21:36:10 THAT THE CITY COUNCIL REMOVED IN 

21:36:11 SEPTEMBER, THERE ARE MANY SORT 

21:36:12 OF BIG TRAIL PROJECTS THAT WE'RE 

21:36:14 SEEKING TO ADVANCE.

21:36:16 AND ONE SIGNIFICANT PROJECT THAT 

21:36:19 IS IN THE NORTH FREMONT AREA IS 

21:36:22 THE DUMBARTON TO QUARRY LAKES 

21:36:23 TRAIL, WHICH IS A NEW TRAIL 

21:36:27 CORRIDOR THAT WOULD GO FROM THE 

21:36:31 DUMBARTON BRIDGE BY THE 

21:36:35 DUMBARTON QUARRY CAMPGROUNDS, 

21:36:40 COYOTE HILLS, CONNECT WITH THE 

21:36:42 FACEBOOK DEVELOPMENT, ARDENWOOD 

21:36:46 PARK AND QUARRY LAKES PARKWAY.

21:36:49 THIS IS ANOTHER MAJOR PROJECT 

21:36:50 THAT WE ARE ACTIVELY DEVELOPING 

21:36:52 AND IN PARALLEL WOULD BE WORKING 

21:36:54 TO TRY TO GET FUNDING FROM 

21:36:56 REALLY AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF 

21:36:57 INVESTMENT THAT'S COMING IN AT 

21:36:58 THE FEDERAL LEVEL.

21:37:00 THE OTHER BIG PROJECT IS 

21:37:02 EXTENDING UPON THE RECENT 

21:37:04 OPENING OF THE WARM SPRINGS WEST 

21:37:05 ACCESS BRIDGE.

21:37:06 SO WE BRIDGED OVER THE RAILROAD 

21:37:07 TRACKS THERE.

21:37:14 WE'LL BE ABLE TO CONNECT TO THE 

21:37:16  

21:37:19 TESLA FACTORY AREA, AND MANY 

21:37:22 OTHER SYSTEMS, SO THAT'S A THIRD 

21:37:23 BIG PROJECT WHICH IS PART OF THE 

21:37:25 EAST BAY GREEN WAY CORRIDOR.

21:37:27 SO DUMBARTON QUARRY LAKES IN THE 

21:37:30 NORTH, SABERCAT, CENTRAL PARK IN 

21:37:31 CENTRAL FREMONT AND THEN 

21:37:35 SOUTHERN FREMONT, THE EAST BAY 

21:37:38 GREEN WAY CONNECTION IN THE 

21:37:40 INNOVATION DISTRICT OR KIND OF 

21:37:43 WHAT WE'RE CHARACTERIZING AS THE 

21:37:46 BIG THREE TRAIL SYSTEMS THAT 

21:37:47 WE'RE TRYING TO ADVANCE IN THE 

21:37:48 COMING YEARS.

21:37:50 SO I THINK THERE'S EXCITING NEWS 

21:37:52 ALL ACROSS FREMONT IN THE TERMS 

21:37:54 OF EXPANDING OUR TRAIL NETWORK.

21:37:56 >> Councilmember Keng:   GREAT, 

21:37:57 THANKS SO MUCH FOR FILLING THAT 

21:37:58 IN.

21:38:00 AND ALSO JUST ONE LAST QUESTION.

21:38:02 WHEN YOU SAID WE HAVE A SMALL, 

21:38:04 THE CITY WOULD HAVE A SMALL 

21:38:07 MARCHING FUNDING, HOW MUCH 

21:38:09 EXACTLY, DO YOU KNOW YET?

21:38:11 >> Hans Larsen:   I WOULD SAY 

21:38:13 TYPICALLY IN ORDER TO -- I MEAN 

21:38:14 WE COULD PROBABLY USE AS AN 

21:38:17 EXAMPLE THE RECENTLY OPENED WEST 

21:38:19 ACCESS BRIDGE WAS A $41 MILLION 

21:38:20 PROJECT.

21:38:23 SO THE CITY CONTRIBUTED 11, AND 

21:38:27 THEN WE WERE ABLE TO GET A $30 

21:38:31 MILLION GRANT FROM ALAMEDA CTC.

21:38:32 WE THINK WITH THE AVAILABILITY 

21:38:34 OF FEDERAL MONEYS ALSO, THAT THE 

21:38:36 AMOUNT OF MATCH THAT WE MAY NEED 

21:38:39 TO DO IS PROBABLY SMALLER THAN 

21:38:41 WHAT WE'VE HAD TO DO IN THE 

21:38:41 PAST.

21:38:44 AND THAT WE'RE LARGELY LOOKING 

21:38:45 AT FUNDS THAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE 

21:38:48 TO US THROUGH OUR TRANSPORTATION 

21:38:51 PROGRAM AND OUR EFFORTS TO BUILD 

21:38:55 A GOOD BIKE NETWORK, PROBABLY BE 

21:38:56 THE MAIN SOURCE OF FUNDING THAT 

21:38:57 WE WOULD BE LOOKING AT TO 

21:39:01 PROVIDE THE MATCH.

21:39:03 AND WE DO HAVE WITHIN OUR 

21:39:04 TRANSPORTATION CAPITAL PROGRAM 

21:39:07 SET ASIDE MATCHING MONEYS IN 

21:39:10 ORDER TO BE ABLE TO ATTRACT AND 

21:39:14 COMPETE FOR THESE LARGE 

21:39:16 REGIONAL, STATE AND FEDERAL 

21:39:18 GRANT PROGRAMS.

21:39:19 >> Councilmember Keng:   RIGHT, 

21:39:20 THANKS SO MUCH DIRECTOR.

21:39:22 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

21:39:23 I ALSO WAS GOING TO MENTION I 

21:39:25 THINK THIS YEAR WE'RE ALSO GOING 

21:39:28 TO BE DOING CLOSING DOWN AGAIN 

21:39:30 NILES CANYON TRAIL TO HAVE THE 

21:39:33 ROLL AND STROLL IS COMING UP, SO 

21:39:34 THAT WOULD BE A GREAT WAY TO BE 

21:39:39 ABLE TO HIGHLIGHT.

21:39:40 VICE MAYOR SALWAN.

21:39:40 >> Councilmember Salwan:   WITH 

21:39:42 ALL THOSE COMMENTS I THINK I'M 

21:39:43 READY TO MAKE THE MOTION.

21:39:44 AND MAYBE THROW IN A COMMENT 

21:39:52 THAT I THINK THAT MR. LARSEN WAS 

21:39:53 MENTIONING, A LOT OF THESE 

21:39:55 STUDIES THEY PREP US NOR 

21:39:55 FUNDING.

21:39:57 IF WE DO THE INITIAL WORK WE'RE 

21:39:59 MUCH MORE COMPETITIVE WHEN THESE 

21:40:01 STATE GRANTS AND FEDERAL GRANTS 

21:40:03 COME UP SO FOR SHOVEL READY 

21:40:05 WE'REFUL MORE LIKELY TO GET THE 

21:40:07 FUNDING WHICH ALLOWS YOU TO 

21:40:10 LEVERAGE THE STATE, COUNTY AND 

21:40:10 FEDERAL FUNDING.

21:40:13 WE SHOULD DO IT IN ALL PARTS OF 

21:40:14 FREMONT AND I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT 

21:40:17 THIS MOTION.

21:40:18 >> Councilmember Shao:   I 

21:40:20 SECOND.

21:40:22 >> Mayor Mei:   SECONDED BY 

21:40:23 COUNCILMEMBER SHAO.

21:40:25 I'M HAVING HARD TO SEE BECAUSE 

21:40:28 I'M LOOKING AT MY PARTICIPANT 

21:40:29 LIST.

21:40:31 MOTION BY VICE MAYOR SALWAN AND 

21:40:34 SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER SHAO.

21:40:37 ROLL CALL VOTE PLEASE.

21:40:47 COUNCILMEMBER JONES, AYE.

21:40:54 AYE.

21:40:55 >> Mayor Mei:   MOST PASSES

21:41:05 COUNCILMEMBER KENG YOU HAVE YOUR 

21:41:07 HAND RAISED, DO YOU HAVE ANOTHER 

21:41:07 COMMENT?

21:41:08 OKAY.

21:41:13 NEXT, I DON'T SEE ANY COUNCIL 

21:41:14 REFERRALS.

21:41:15 WE ALSO STILL HAVE SPEAKERS I 

21:41:17 THINK, IT LOOKS LIKE BECAUSE WE 

21:41:20 HAD TO STOP OUR PUBLIC COMMENTS 

21:41:20 EARLIER.

21:41:24 BECAUSE OF THE HEARING FOR THE 

21:41:24 REDISTRICTING.

21:41:26 AND I WAS GOING TO CHECK TO MAKE 

21:41:28 SURE.

21:41:28 >> CORRECT.

21:41:30 RIGHT.

21:41:31 >> Mayor Mei:   TWO PEOPLE.

21:41:33 >> YES, HOWEVER WE JUST NEED TO 

21:41:34 MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT CALLING 

21:41:37 ON PEOPLE WHO HAD ALREADY SPOKEN 

21:41:39 EARLIER THIS EVENING.

21:41:41 >> Mayor Mei:   YOU CAN'T REPEAT 

21:41:43 AGAIN UNDER PUBLIC COMMENTS.

21:41:43 >> CORRECT.

21:41:48 >> Mayor Mei:   SO I SEE MARIE 

21:41:48 HUGHES.

21:42:01 WELCOME.

21:42:01 >> MARIE.

21:42:04 >> NOBODY GAVE ME AN UNMUTE.

21:42:06 MY NAME IS MARIE HUGHES, I'M A 

21:42:08 LONG TIME RESIDENT OF FREMONT, I 

21:42:09 LIVE IN NILES.

21:42:17 I WANT TO EXPRESS SHANGRI LA 

21:42:18 THEY ANSWERED MANY, MANY 

21:42:22 QUESTIONS AND GAVE A COMPLETE 

21:42:24 PLAN FOR HOW THEY'RE GOING TO 

21:42:27 TURN MOTEL 6 INTO 156 PERMANENT 

21:42:28 HOUSING UNITS.

21:42:30 WE ALL KNOW THAT FREMONT IS 

21:42:34 BEHIND IN OUR AFFORDABLE HOUSING 

21:42:35 ACCORDING TO OUR MASTER PLAN AND 

21:42:38 HAVING THE STATE GIVE US $40 

21:42:41 MILLION TO DO THIS IS JUST A 

21:42:42 WONDERFUL GIFT.

21:42:44 AND I REALLY HOPE TO HEAR THAT 

21:42:46 WE GOT THE GRANT IN MARCH.

21:42:47 THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

21:42:52 >> Mayor Mei:   THEN I WAS GOING 

21:42:54 TO JUST CHECK TO SEE WHO HAS 

21:42:55 ALREADY SPOKEN.

21:42:57 I THINK KATHERINE, I APOLOGIZE, 

21:43:00 I THINK I MAY HAVE CALLED YOU 

21:43:03 EARLIER -- DID YOU SPOKE --

21:43:05 >> KATHERINE RUBY SPOKE UNDER 

21:43:06 5A.

21:43:10 I DON'T HAVE HER LISTED FOR 4A.

21:43:11 >> Mayor Mei:   KATHERINE 

21:43:12 WELCOME.

21:43:14 >> THANK YOU, IS THIS OPEN 

21:43:17 COMMENTS FOR ANYTHING SUCH AS 

21:43:18 PROJECT HOMEKEY?

21:43:19 >> Mayor Mei:   YES.

21:43:19 >> GREAT.

21:43:21 I JUST WANT TO REITERATE MY 

21:43:24 SUPPORT FOR PROJECT HOMEKEY AND 

21:43:25 REMIND EVERYONE THAT THIS IS 

21:43:26 CONSIDERED PERMANENT HOUSING.

21:43:29 AND WITH SUPPORTIVE SERVICES, 

21:43:31 AND I JUST AM FAILING TO 

21:43:33 UNDERSTAND WHY PEOPLE ARE 

21:43:36 OBJECTING TO THIS IDEA OF 

21:43:37 PERMANENT HOUSING WITH 

21:43:38 SUPPORTIVE SERVICES.

21:43:40 IT DOESN'T GET ANY BETTER THAN 

21:43:41 THIS.

21:43:44 AND THEN THEY COMPLAIN THAT 

21:43:47 OTHER PROJECTS WILL ATTRACT 

21:43:49 HOMELESS PEOPLE TO SET UP 

21:43:50 ENCAMPMENTS.

21:43:51 AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND, YOU 

21:43:52 KNOW, HOW YOU CAN JUSTIFY BOTH 

21:43:53 OF THOSE THOUGHTS.

21:43:56 AND I JUST WANT TO KEEP SAYING, 

21:43:57 YOU KNOW, FREMONT'S ON THE RIGHT 

21:43:59 TRACK.

21:44:02 AGENCY, SAFE PARKING, PROJECT 

21:44:03 HOMEKEY ALL OF THESE ARE 

21:44:04 POSITIVE THINGS THAT ARE GOING 

21:44:06 TO HELP WITH THE HOMELESS 

21:44:06 SITUATION.

21:44:08 THANK YOU FOR BEING ON THE RIGHT 

21:44:10 TRACK.

21:44:13 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

21:44:15 I SEE JANE BUT DID YOU SPEAK 

21:44:16 EARLIER?

21:44:24 I APOLOGIZE.

21:44:26 >> I SPOKE ON THE TRAIL.

21:44:30 SO I WANT TO SPEAK UNDER GENERAL 

21:44:31 PUBLIC COMMENTS.

21:44:34 470 OF THE 806 HOMELESS PEOPLE 

21:44:37 IN THE CITY WERE ARRESTED FOR 

21:44:40 NOT DRUG OR PETTY THEFTS BECAUSE 

21:44:44 THOSE ARE NORMALIZED AS EQUAL, 

21:44:46 BEING THE SO-CALLED BAD ACTORS, 

21:44:48 HOW DO YOU ENSURE THAT ONCE 

21:44:48  

21:44:51 HOUSED THEY WILL NO LONGER 

21:44:54 COMMIT CRIMES.

21:44:56 WE WELCOME THE WORKING POOR 

21:44:58 WITHOUT CRIMINAL HISTORY.

21:45:00 NOT THE 77% WITH CRIMINAL 

21:45:01 HISTORY.

21:45:04 ANTAGONIZING YOUR OWN 

21:45:04 CONSTITUENTS CLAIMING THAT WE 

21:45:07 ARE DANGEROUS TO THE HOMELESS.

21:45:09 WE HOPE YOU CAN BE FAIR AND SEE 

21:45:12 THE TRUTH AND TRUST THE CITY'S 

21:45:14 OWN DATA, IF YOU SPREAD 

21:45:15 MISINFORMATION THEN PROVE THAT 

21:45:18 THE CITY'S DATA IS WRONG.

21:45:20 PROVIDE EXAMPLES THAT A NORMAL 

21:45:22 CITY RESIDENT IS ATTACKING THE 

21:45:23 HOMELESS PEOPLE.

21:45:27 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

21:45:29 NEXT SPEAKER IS CL.

21:45:34 >> HI, I KNOW THAT THE HOMEKEY 

21:45:37 INTENTION IS GOOD BUT MY TAKE IS 

21:45:39 IT'S NOT NECESSARILY THE RIGHT 

21:45:41 WAY IF THERE IS NO GUARDRAIL.

21:45:43 AFTER GOING THROUGH THE FAQ, 

21:45:45 WOULD YOU CONSIDER SEVERELY 

21:45:48 MENTALLY ILL, ADDICTS WITH 

21:45:50 CRITICAL HISTORY BE QUALIFIED?

21:45:51 BECAUSE I'M DEMANDING A PUBLIC 

21:45:53 DEBATE TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE.

21:45:55 I GOT TO BE REAL, MAN.

21:45:57 ON JANUARY 11th, 2022, THERE 

21:46:03 WAS AN BRAWBT VIOLENT ENTRY INTO 

21:46:08 A PRIVATE AREA WITH RISK OF HARM 

21:46:11 TO MINORS AND ELDERS.

21:46:13 THIS TERRORIZED THE ENTIRE 

21:46:15 COMMUNITY, THE POLICE WEREN'T 

21:46:17 HELPFUL AT ALL, THEY LEFT US 

21:46:19 SITTING DUCK, THEY DID NOT 

21:46:21 PROCEED AND EXTRACT THE 

21:46:21 HOMELESS.

21:46:23 NOW WE ALSO HAVE THE AFFORDABLE 

21:46:25 HOUSING RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET 

21:46:28 AND WE HAVE THEFTS FROM THEM.

21:46:28 OKAY?

21:46:30 SO HOW CAN YOU ENSURE THE PEOPLE 

21:46:32 IN THE LOWER 15% ARE SAFE?

21:46:36 >> Mayor Mei:   NEXT SPEAKER IS 

21:46:37 LUSAN.

21:46:42 >> HI, I THINK THE CITY SHOULD 

21:46:44 CONSIDER ALL THE CONCERNS FROM 

21:46:47 THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

21:46:49 IF I'M PARENT, I DON'T LIKE MY 

21:46:53 CASE TO GO TO THE KINDERGARTEN 

21:46:55 NEXT TO OUR HOMELESS SHELTER OR 

21:46:56 HOMELESS HOUSING.

21:47:00 I THINK THOSE SHOULD BE 

21:47:03 CONSIDERED.

21:47:05 AND IT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA TO 

21:47:08 BUILD A HOMELESS HOUSING NEAR 

21:47:11 THE -- SO MANY KIDS AND SO MANY 

21:47:13 SENIORS NEIGHBORHOOD.

21:47:15 IF YOU BUILD I THINK YOU SHOULD 

21:47:20 CONSIDER THOSE VOICE AND PUT 

21:47:22 SOME DISTANCE AND BE ACCEPTABLE 

21:47:24 TO ALL THE PEOPLE.

21:47:26 MAYBE SOME INDUSTRIAL AREA OR A 

21:47:28 FEW MILES AWAY, MAYBE ALL THE 

21:47:33 PEOPLE CAN BE ACCEPTABLE.

21:47:37 >> Mayor Mei:   NEXT SPEAKER IS 

21:47:40 HAYES SHARE.

21:47:41 >> GOOD EVENING EVERYONE, MY 

21:47:43 NAME IS HAYES SHARE, I'M A 

21:47:44 FATHER OF TWO AND I SUPPORT THE 

21:47:46 HOMEKEY PROJECT.

21:47:48 I SUPPORT THE CITY OF FREMONT OF 

21:47:49 TAKING THIS INITIATIVE TO 

21:47:51 ACTUALLY HOUSE OUR NEIGHBORS.

21:47:52 ONE STATISTIC THAT I WILL DRIVE 

21:47:53 HOME TONIGHT IS THAT ONCE YOU 

21:47:57 GIVE AN UNHOUSED PERSON A HOME 

21:47:59 THEY NOR LONGER HOMELESS.

21:48:01 THIS IS AN AFFORDABLE HOUSING 

21:48:03 PROJECT NOT A HOMELESS SHELTER.

21:48:04 IF YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBER OF 911 

21:48:06 CALLS TO THE MOTEL 6 YOU WILL 

21:48:09 SEE THAT THEY OUT-NUMBER THE 

21:48:12 CALLS TO THE HNC, TO SUNRISE 

21:48:13 VILLAGE OR A NUMBER OF THE 

21:48:15 UNHOUSED SERVICES IN FREMONT BY 

21:48:16 FAR.

21:48:17 CONVERTING THIS TO AFFORDABLE 

21:48:19 HOUSING WILL MAKE IT SAFER IN 

21:48:20 THIS NEIGHBORHOOD.

21:48:21 THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

21:48:22 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

21:48:24 NEXT SPEAKER IS DINA.

21:48:28 >> HELLO, I JUST WANTED TO SAY 

21:48:31 THAT THE PEOPLE HERE ARE NOT 

21:48:33 NECESSARILY AGAINST HOMELESS 

21:48:37 PROJECT BUT THEY ARE WORRIED 

21:48:39 ABOUT PSYCHIATRICALLY ILL PEOPLE 

21:48:40 BEING HOUSED HERE.

21:48:42 I THINK THERE IS LACK OF 

21:48:44 TRANSPARENCY AND THE INFORMATION 

21:48:47 STUCK SOMEWHERE DEEP INSIDE, 

21:48:48 SOMEBODY AND SOME PRESENTATIONS 

21:48:51 THAT HAVE BEEN DONE WHICH PEOPLE 

21:48:53 AT LARGE ARE NOT AVAILABLE AND I 

21:48:54 THINK THAT'S THE KEY ISSUE HERE 

21:48:56 LACK OF TRANSPARENCY AND 

21:48:57 COMMUNICATION TO THE PUBLIC TO 

21:48:58 TELL WHAT IT IS.

21:49:00 AND IT IS VERY EASY JUST FOR THE 

21:49:02 TOWN HALL AND GET IT DONE WITH 

21:49:03 AND COMMUNICATE TO PEOPLE RATHER 

21:49:05 THAN JUST TRY TO SWEEP THIS 

21:49:07 UNDER THE RUG AND QUICKLY IN 

21:49:08 FOUR DAYS.

21:49:10 SO NOBODY'S ARGUING AGAINST 

21:49:11 BENEFITS.

21:49:14 PEOPLE ARE JUST ARGUING AGAINST 

21:49:15 TRANSPARENCY, LACK OF 

21:49:16 TRANSPARENCY.

21:49:18 I HOPE THAT MESSAGE IS CLEAR AND 

21:49:19 WE DO SOMETHING TO COMMUNICATE 

21:49:20 IT OUT.

21:49:21 THANK YOU.

21:49:22 >> Mayor Mei:   NEXT SPEAKER IS 

21:49:23 JAMES.

21:49:24 HAVE YOU SPOKEN?

21:49:29 WELCOME.

21:49:31 I KNOW SELL OF THEM ARE GOING TO 

21:49:32 BE REPEATS.

21:49:37 JAMES HAVE YOU SPOKEN ALREADY ON 

21:49:38 ORAL COMMUNICATION?

21:49:40 >> JAMES HAS NOT.

21:49:42 >> Mayor Mei:   OKAY, WELCOME.

21:49:44 >> HELLO CAN YOU HEAR ME?

21:49:45 >> Mayor Mei:   YES.

21:49:46 >> HELLO SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE 

21:49:50 A REBUTTAL ON TWO ARGUMENTS.

21:49:54 FIRST ONE IS I'M THINKING OF OUR 

21:49:55 FATHER IN FREMONT SAYING THAT 

21:49:59 THE HOMEKEY PROJECT SOLVING THE 

21:50:00 HOMELESS PROBLEM, I WOULD DOUBT 

21:50:01 ON THAT.

21:50:03 WE HAVE THE HOMELESS ON THE 

21:50:04 ORDER OF TENS OF THOUSANDS IN 

21:50:06 OUR CITY, METRO AREA.

21:50:11 BUT HOMEKEY CAN ONLY SATISFY 100 

21:50:12 OF THEM.

21:50:14 I THINK WE HAVE ABSORBED MORE 

21:50:18 HOMELESS COME TO THIS AREA AND 

21:50:19 PROBABLY MADE THE WHOLE 

21:50:20 ENVIRONMENT EVEN WORSE.

21:50:26 ANOTHER ONE IS ACTUALLY FROM 

21:50:28 SORRY JUST ONE MOMENT, AN 

21:50:30 ARGUMENT AT THE BEGINNING OF THE 

21:50:33 MEETING FROM SUNRISE KIDENGO.

21:50:35 I THINK IT'S REALITY WRONG TO 

21:50:44 JUST ASK ONE PARTY TO 

21:50:44 REPRESENT --

21:50:45 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

21:50:49 NEXT SPEAKER.

21:50:51 >> THANK YOU, COUNCILMEMBER.

21:50:53 MOTEL 6 IS THE FIRST HOMELESS 

21:50:54 MOTEL WE WILL GET.

21:50:56 BUT I WON'T SUPPORT IT UNTIL THE 

21:50:59 CITY CAN GUARANTEE ITS LONG 

21:51:00 DISTANCE SAFETY, ESPECIALLY THE 

21:51:02 SENIORS AND KIDS BECAUSE IT'S SO 

21:51:05 CLOSE TO SENIOR HOUSING, 

21:51:06 DAYCARE, SCHOOLS AND AFTER 

21:51:06 SCHOOLS.

21:51:09 AND THE CITY HAS LATER SHOWED 

21:51:12 THAT 77% OF THE FREMONT HOMELESS 

21:51:12 HAVE BEEN ARRESTED OR THE 

21:51:13 CRIMES.

21:51:15 AND THIS PROJECT DOESN'T INCLUDE 

21:51:24 THESE PEOPLE, NOT AS IT EXCLUDES 

21:51:27 SUBSTANCE ABUSERS AND MANY 

21:51:30 VICTIMS OF CRIME DON'T GET 

21:51:31 POLICE RESPONSE BECAUSE THE 

21:51:33 POLICE FORCE IS SIMPLY 

21:51:34 OVERWHELMED.

21:51:36 INVITE MORE HOMELESS IN THIS 

21:51:38 AREA MULTIPLE STUDIES HAVE SHOWN 

21:51:40 THAT AN INCREASE IN CRIME RATE 

21:51:42 IN COMMUNITIES AROUND HOMELESS 

21:51:43 HOUSING SO HOW WILL YOU DEAL 

21:51:47 WITH THIS DYNAMIC, THAT IS MY 

21:51:49 MAJOR QUESTION, THANK YOU.

21:51:53 >> Mayor Mei:   NEXT SPEAKER IS 

21:51:56 BLAIR BEEKMAN.

21:52:03 >> HI, THANK YOU.

21:52:04 BLAIR BEEKMAN HERE.

21:52:07 THANK YOU FOR EXTENDING PUBLIC 

21:52:09 COMMENT, THIS INTERESTING PUBLIC 

21:52:11 MEETING FOR THIS WEEK.

21:52:13 I JUST WANTED TO BE ABILITY TO 

21:52:15 QUICKLY OFFER A REMINDER OF THE 

21:52:17 IMPORTANCE OF WHAT OPEN PUBLIC 

21:52:18 POLICIES AND ACCOUNTABILITY CAN 

21:52:21 OFFER THE COMMUNITY WITH 

21:52:24 SURVEILLANCE AND TECHNOLOGY.

21:52:25 AND DATA COLLECTION PRACTICES.

21:52:28 I THINK IT OFFERS AN INTERESTING 

21:52:30 HOPEFUL FUTURE THAT EVERYONE CAN 

21:52:32 BE CONSIDERING AS PART OF GOOD 

21:52:34 PRACTICES FOR THE FUTURE OF A 

21:52:35 COMMUNITY.

21:52:38 AND WITH HOMEKEY ISSUES THAT 

21:52:41 HOMEKEY IS JUST ONE PART OF 

21:52:44 SEVERAL GOOD PLANS THAT A LOCAL 

21:52:46 CITY GOVERNMENT CAN PRACTICE 

21:52:49 WITH THEIR HOMELESS ISSUES THAT 

21:52:51 GOOD LUCK HOW TO BUDGET OUR 

21:52:55 MONEY FOR THESE GOOD PRACTICES, 

21:52:56 THANK YOU.

21:52:56 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

21:52:58 THAT'S THE LAST OF OUR PUBLIC 

21:53:01 SPEAKERS THIS EVENING.

21:53:02 AND BRING IT BACK TO ORAL 

21:53:07 REPORTS ON MEETINGS AND EVENTS 

21:53:09 THAT ARE RELATED TO THE COUNCIL 

21:53:09 RULES.

21:53:13 >> Councilmember Kassan:   SORRY 

21:53:16 I JUST NEED TO MAKE A COMMENT ON 

21:53:17 SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WERE 

21:53:19 SAID AND ALSO AN E-MAIL THAT WE 

21:53:19 RECEIVED.

21:53:21 IN A DEMOCRACY IT IS SO 

21:53:23 IMPORTANT AS WE KNOW TO NOT 

21:53:24 SPREAD MISINFORMATION.

21:53:25 AND THERE IS ONE PIECE OF 

21:53:28 INFORMATION THAT JANE TALKED 

21:53:30 ABOUT AND ALSO SENT AN E-MAILED 

21:53:33 ABOUT AND IT SOUNDS VERY 

21:53:34 INCORRECT TO ME.

21:53:37 BUT I WAS JUST HOPING MAYBE 

21:53:38 SOMEONE FROM OUR HUMAN SERVICES 

21:53:40 DEPARTMENT COULD CORRECT THIS 

21:53:40 INFORMATION.

21:53:43 SO JANE SAYS THAT 77% OF THE 

21:53:47 HOMELESS POPULATION IN FREMONT 

21:53:50 HAS BEEN ARRESTED.

21:53:51 MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE 

21:53:53 CRIME RATE AMONG HOMELESS PEOPLE 

21:53:56 IS THE SAME IF NOT LESS THAN 

21:53:57 PEOPLE WITH HOMES.

21:54:00 SO IN -- I FEEL IT'S SO, SO 

21:54:01 IMPORTANT NOT TO LET THAT 

21:54:02 INFORMATION STAND, ASSUMING THAT 

21:54:04 IT IS NOT CORRECT.

21:54:06 SO IS THERE SOMEONE HERE FROM 

21:54:07 HUMAN SERVICES THAT MIGHT HAVE 

21:54:13 THE CORRECT INFORMATION?

21:54:18 >> Mayor Mei:   I --

21:54:18 >> Councilmember Jones:   EXCUSE 

21:54:20 ME, MADAM MAYOR.

21:54:21 >> Mayor Mei:   COUNCILMEMBER 

21:54:23 JONES WERE YOU GOING TO ANSWER 

21:54:25 THIS FROM YOUR LIFE EXPERIENCE?

21:54:27 >> Councilmember Jones:   I 

21:54:28 DIDN'T WANT TO GO THERE BECAUSE 

21:54:32 IT'S NOT AN AGENDIZED ITEM.

21:54:33 >> Councilmember Keng:   WE DO 

21:54:36 

21:54:38 >> Councilmember Kassan:   WE DO 

21:54:40 HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO CORRECT 

21:54:42 PUBLIC MISINFORMATION.

21:54:43 I THINK IT'S VERY, VERY 

21:54:44 IMPORTANT THAT WE CLARIFY THAT 

21:54:46 IT IS ABSOLUTELY NOT THE CASE 

21:54:48 THAT 77% OF HOMELESS PEOPLE IN 

21:54:50 FREMONT ARE CRIMINALS.

21:54:51 AND IF THERE'S NO ONE ON HERE 

21:54:55 NOW THAT CAN REAFFIRM THAT, I 

21:54:56 CAN -- I AM CERTAIN THAT THAT IS 

21:54:57 NOT CORRECT.

21:54:59 I DON'T HAVE ALL THE DATA WITH 

21:55:01 ME BUT I KNOW THAT THAT IS NOT 

21:55:01 CORRECT.

21:55:05 SO WE HOPEFULLY WILL FIND A WAY 

21:55:06 TO SHARE THE CORRECT INFORMATION 

21:55:08 ON THAT.

21:55:09 >> Mayor Mei:   I WILL REFERENCE 

21:55:10 QUICKLY.

21:55:17 IT IS JUST THAT OUR FAQS AND 

21:55:18 CHIEF WASHINGTON DID PULL UP 

21:55:20 SOME OF THE STATISTICS AND WHILE 

21:55:22 I CAN'T SAY FOR ALL BUT I KNOW 

21:55:24 WHEN WE DID THE STUDY OF THREE 

21:55:26 OF THE HOMELESS SUPPORTIVE 

21:55:28 SERVICES, IN THIS CASE THIS IS 

21:55:30 PERMANENT HOUSING, NOT HOMELESS 

21:55:32 NAVIGATION CENTER, AGAIN TO 

21:55:35 CLARIFY, SHOWED THAT THE CRIME 

21:55:37 RATES WERE DRAMATICALLY 

21:55:39 DIFFERENT AND ACTUALLY THE MOTEL 

21:55:44 6 HAD CURRENTLY MUCH HIGHER 

21:55:44 RATE.

21:55:45 SO I WOULD JUST ASK PEOPLE IN 

21:55:48 THE PUBLIC IF YOU HAVE 

21:55:50 QUESTIONS, WE DID NOTICE THE 

21:55:51 MEETINGS, WE DID HAVE PEOPLE 

21:55:52 COME AND SPEAK.

21:55:54 WE DID HAVE A PRESENTATION WHICH 

21:55:57 YOU CAN VIEW ON COUNCIL 

21:55:57 RECORDING.

21:55:59 AND THEN ALSO I KNOW THAT I HAVE 

21:56:01 TO THANK OUR STAFF FOR PUTTING 

21:56:03 OUT THE DETAILED FAQS.

21:56:05 COUNCILMEMBER SHAO.

21:56:09 >> Councilmember Shao:   THANK 

21:56:10 YOU, MADAM MAYOR.

21:56:12 I JUST WANTED TO REPORT THAT 

21:56:14 LAST WEEK, WE HAD THE MASTER 

21:56:16 MEETING AT ALAMEDA COUNTY 

21:56:17 HOUSING AUTHORITY AND I'M GLAD 

21:56:20 TO REPORT THAT RIGHT NOW, THE 

21:56:22  

21:56:23 HOUSING AUTHORITY IS WORKING 

21:56:26 CLOSELY WITH THE CITY OF FREMONT 

21:56:28 GOVERNMENT ON EIGHT DIFFERENT 

21:56:31 PROJECTS IN ORDER TO FULLY USE 

21:56:33 THE ADDITIONAL EMERGENCY 

21:56:36 VOUCHERS COMING FROM THE FEDERAL 

21:56:42 GOVERNMENT TO HELP HOUSE MORE

21:57:00 CONJUNCTION WITH THE COUNTY.

21:57:05 THAT IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO HELP 

21:57:06 OUT.

21:57:07 AND THEN ALSO I KNOW THAT OUR
