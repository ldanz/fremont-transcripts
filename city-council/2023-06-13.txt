THEY INVESTIGATE WHY COLLISIONS HAPPEN UNLIKE IN THE U.S., THEIR

[Captioner] 19:36:10

I WONDER WHAT THEIR EXPERTS WOULD

[Captioner] 19:36:34
 SAY ABOUT THE BOULDER MINEFIELD THAT THE CITY OF FREMONT

[Captioner] 19:36:37
 INSTALLED ON KATO ROAD.
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT

[Captioner] 19:36:41
 WARM SPRINGS NEEDS MORE

THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:36:51

[Captioner] 19:36:52
 THAT'S THE LAST SPEAKER.

[Captioner] 19:36:55
AT THIS TIME, I'M GOING TO CLOSE THE ORAL COMMUNICATIONS PUBLIC

[Captioner] 19:36:59
 COMMUNICATIONS PORTION, AND

[Captioner] 19:37:03
 WE'LL RETURN TO CONSIDERATION OF ITEMS PULLED FROM THE CONSENT CALENDAR

[Captioner] 19:37:06
 AND I BELIEVE THAT'S ITEM 2C AS IN CAT AND THAT'S

[Captioner] 19:37:09
 A SPECIAL EVENT SPONSORSHIP PROGRAM.
AND I BELIEVE WE HAVE

[Captioner] 19:37:11
 A COUPLE PUBLIC SPEAKERS ON THIS ITEM.


[Captioner] 19:37:14
>> Ms. Gauthier: KATHY KIMBERLIN

[Captioner] 19:37:18
 FOLLOWED BY LINDA

[Captioner] 19:37:20
 DULANEY.
>> Mayor Mei: WELCOME.


[Captioner] 19:37:23
>> GOOD EVENING.
KATHY KIMBERLIN HERE.


[Captioner] 19:37:27
I AM PART OF THE FREMONT FOURTH OF JULY

[Captioner] 19:37:31
 NON-PROFIT COMMITTEE, AND BOY, HAS IT BEEN -- IT HAS BEEN A YEAR.


[Captioner] 19:37:34
I WANTED TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT -- FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU

[Captioner] 19:37:37
 FOR THE PROCESS OF THE SPECIAL EVENT SPONSORSHIP, BUT I HAVE A

[Captioner] 19:37:39
 LITTLE INPUT THAT I HOPE YOU CAN CONSIDER GOING FORWARD.


[Captioner] 19:37:43
A LITTLE BIT OF A HISTORY IS THAT AS YOU ALL KNOW,

[Captioner] 19:37:46
 THIS PROCESS HAS EVOLVED AND I HOPE IT CONTINUES TO EVOLVE.


[Captioner] 19:37:50
THE FREMONT FOURTH OF JULY PARADE USED TO BE PUT ON BY THE CITY.


[Captioner] 19:37:53
THEN WHEN TOUGH ECONOMIC TIMES HIT, A NON-PROFIT TOOK OVER THE

[Captioner] 19:37:56
 EFFORT.
THAT NON-PROFIT CONTINUES TO TAKE OVER 

[Captioner] 19:37:59
THAT EFFORT.
AND WE WORK VERY HARD, CARRYING

[Captioner] 19:38:02
 THAT FINANCIAL BURDEN AND FUNDRAISE.
IN 2019, A

[Captioner] 19:38:05
 PROPOSAL WAS MADE TO SUPPORT THE FREMONT FOURTH OF JULY

[Captioner] 19:38:09
 PARADE ANNUALLY, NO QUESTIONS ASKED.
BUT THEN I

[Captioner] 19:38:12
 THINK EQUITY CAME INTO THE PICTURE AND ANOTHER CHANGE WAS MADE TO NOW MAKE IT

[Captioner] 19:38:15
 A COMPETITIVE APPLICATION TO ALLOWL FOR ALL TYPES OF

[Captioner] 19:38:19
 NON-PROFIT EVENTS TO APPLY FOR THIS, AND IT BECAME A COMPETITIVE

[Captioner] 19:38:22
 PROCESS.
THE MAX

[Captioner] 19:38:25
 POT HAS STAYED AT 300K AND THE CITY COSTS RISE

[Captioner] 19:38:29
 EVERY YEAR, AS EXPECTED, AS MANY THINGS

[Captioner] 19:38:30
 HAVE PASSED THROUGH THIS PANDEMIC, EVERYTHING HAS RISEN.


[Captioner] 19:38:34
I ASK THAT DISCUSSION AND CONSIDERATION ON INCREASING

[Captioner] 19:38:37
 THIS POT TO CONTINUE THE CITY'S SUPPORT OF MANY OF THE

[Captioner] 19:38:41
 LONG-TIME TRADITIONAL ALL CULTURES AND ALL INCLUSIVE EVENTS SO THAT

[Captioner] 19:38:44
 WE CAN STAY CURRENT, INNOVATIVE AND

[Captioner] 19:38:47
 INCLUSIVE IN SUPPORTING THESE NON-PROFITS.


[Captioner] 19:38:50
THANK YOU V

[Captioner] 19:38:55
 VERY MUCH.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK

[Captioner] 19:38:56
 YOU.
WELCOME.


[Captioner] 19:39:02
>> GOOD EVENING.
MY NAME IS LINDA DULANEY

[Captioner] 19:39:05
 AND I AM HERE TO THANK YOU FOR

[Captioner] 19:39:09
 MAKING THESE GRANTS TO THE RECIPIENTS WHO

[Captioner] 19:39:11
 HAVE APPLIED.
I THINK IT TAKES A SPECIAL KIND OF 

[Captioner] 19:39:15
CITY TO SUPPORT SO WIDELY THE

[Captioner] 19:39:18
 ORGANIZATIONS, THE NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS AND THE OTHER

[Captioner] 19:39:21
 ORGANIZATIONS THAT TRY TO BRING SOME KIND

[Captioner] 19:39:25
 OF HEALTH AND HAPPINESS TO THE RESIDENTS.


[Captioner] 19:39:29
WHEN I LOOK AT THIS AND I SEE THAT THERE

[Captioner] 19:39:33
 ARE GRANTS RANGING FROM $600 UP

[Captioner] 19:39:36
 TO 33,000, AND I THINK THAT'S JUST AN EXAMPLE

[Captioner] 19:39:39
 OF HOW YOU DON'T DISMISS

[Captioner] 19:39:42
 THE LOWER PRICE REQUESTS, THAT YOU CONSIDER

[Captioner] 19:39:44
 EVERYBODY.
AND I JUST REALLY APPRECIATE THAT, 

[Captioner] 19:39:48
BECAUSE YOU GUYS HAVE A LOT OF HARD WORK TO DO AND A LOT OF THINGS THAT 

[Captioner] 19:39:51
AREN'T SO MUCH FUN AND I

[Captioner] 19:39:54
 HOPE THAT IT WAS A PLEASANT EXPERIENCE FOR YOU TO SPEND SOME TIME AND LOOK

[Captioner] 19:39:57
 AT ALL THESE REALLY GREAT THINGS THAT PEOPLE IN THE CITY WANT TO BRING TO 

[Captioner] 19:40:00
THE RESIDENTS, AND I APPRECIATE -- I MEAN, I'M KIND OF INVOLVED IN SOME OF

[Captioner] 19:40:03
 THEM, SO I DO SUPER APPRECIATE THAT YOU'RE DOING THAT, BUT I ALSO

[Captioner] 19:40:07
 DO APPRECIATE JUST THE EFFORT THAT YOU PUT INTO MAKING THESE KIND OF

[Captioner] 19:40:08
 THINGS HAPPEN, SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH.


[Captioner] 19:40:13
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
>> Ms. Gauthier: WE HAVE A HAND RAISED

[Captioner] 19:40:30
LAINE AND I'D LIKE TO EX-PRECT MY

[Captioner] 19:40:33
 SUPPORT KATHY KIMBERLIN'S COMMENTS STATING HOW

[Captioner] 19:40:37
 APPRECIATIVE I AM OF THE PROCESS THAT WE'RE ABLE TO APPLY FOR THESE GRANTS.


[Captioner] 19:40:40
NILES HAS EXPLODED OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS WITH THE EVENTS THAT

[Captioner] 19:40:44
 WE DO TO BRING MORE COMMERCE TO NILES AND TO

[Captioner] 19:40:48
 FREMONT TO BRING THE COMMUNITIES TOGETHER, HOWEVER,

[Captioner] 19:40:51
 COSTS HAVE RISEN, AND WE ARE AT NILES MAIN

[Captioner] 19:40:54
 STREET, WE ARE VERY APPRECIATIVE OF WHAT WE HAVE BEEN

[Captioner] 19:40:57
 AWARDED AND WHAT WE'RE ABLE TO DO AND

[Captioner] 19:41:01
 OUR FOUR BIG EVENTS IS INDICATIVE OF THE WIDE RANGE IN COST IT

[Captioner] 19:41:04
 TAKES TO THROW EVENTS, AND THE TIME, THE

[Captioner] 19:41:07
 VOLUNTEERS AND THE COMMITMENT FROM THE COMMUNITY, THE

[Captioner] 19:41:11
 BUSINESSES AND EVERYBODY INVOLVED TO MAKE ALL OF THESE EVENTS HAPPEN, AND

[Captioner] 19:41:14
 I DO WANT

[Captioner] 19:41:17
 TO EXPRESS MY SINCEREST GRATITUDE FOR ALL THE

[Captioner] 19:41:20
 HARD WORK YOU GUYS DO AND TAKE ALL THIS INTO CONSIDERATION AND

[Captioner] 19:41:23
 AS WELL VOICE THE SAME AS LINDA JUST SPOKE ABOUT

[Captioner] 19:41:27
 ACKNOWLEDGING THE SMALLER EVENTS TO THE LARGER EVENTS AND ALLOWING

[Captioner] 19:41:30
 EVERYBODY A SMALL PIECE, TO HAVE EVERYTHING THAT GOES

[Captioner] 19:41:33
 FORWARD.
SO I WANT TO AGAIN EXPRESS MY

[Captioner] 19:41:36
 HUMBLEST OF GRATITUDE FOR ALL THAT YOU DO, AND WE AT NILES MAIN

[Captioner] 19:41:39
 STREET ARE TRULY THANKFUL FOR THE GRANTS YOU'VE AWARDED

[Captioner] 19:41:40
 US.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:41:46
>> Ms. Gauthier: THAT IS THE LAST SPEAKER.


[Captioner] 19:41:49
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
SO THAT WAS THE LAST SPEAKER FOR

[Captioner] 19:41:52
 ITEM 2C.
COUNCILMEMBER

[Captioner] 19:41:55
 SALWAN.
>> Councilmember Salwan: THANK YOU, 

[Captioner] 19:41:58
MADAME MAYOR.
I JUST HAD A QUICK QUESTION FOR 

[Captioner] 19:42:01
STAFF.
SO AS WE HAVE LIKE RISING

[Captioner] 19:42:05
 COSTS WITH INFLATION AND EVERYTHING, IS THERE A WAY TO LOOK AT HOW DO WE, 

[Captioner] 19:42:08
YOU KNOW, GRADUALLY INCREASE THE $300,000 LIMIT TO KIND

[Captioner] 19:42:11
 OF ADDRESS SMALL CHANGES IN COSTS?
IS THAT SOMETHING THAT WE CAN LOOK

[Captioner] 19:42:15
 INTO?


[Captioner] 19:42:16
>> City Mgr. Shackelford: WE'VE HAD A LITTLE BIT OF THAT.


[Captioner] 19:42:20
WE'VE HAD SOME COST FLUCTUATIONS AND I'M GOING TO LET

[Captioner] 19:42:23
 EITHER AMY G. OR MATT SNELSON SPEAK TO THE SPECIFICS

[Captioner] 19:42:26
 OF THAT.
IN SOME EVENT CASES THE

[Captioner] 19:42:30
 COSTS HAVE GONE UP AS WE'VE HEARD HERE AND IN SOME

[Captioner] 19:42:33
 CASES, THE COSTS HAVE GONE DOWN.


[Captioner] 19:42:37
SO I'LL SEE IF THEY HAVE ANYTHING SPECIFIC THAT THEY'D LIKE TO ADD

[Captioner] 19:42:40
 IN RESPONSE TO YOUR QUESTION.


[Captioner] 19:42:43
AMY, MATT?
>> HI, THIS IS AMY GEE.


[Captioner] 19:42:52
 -- POLICE DEPARTMENT.
I WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS THE SPECIFIC 

[Captioner] 19:42:55
QUESTION.
EVERY YEAR WE GATHER INFORMATION

[Captioner] 19:43:00
 FROM DEPARTMENTS IN TERMS OF THE CITY

[Captioner] 19:43:03
 SERVICE COSTS NEEDED TO SUPPORT THESE EVENTS.


[Captioner] 19:43:06
AND WE DO A VERY COMPREHENSIVE

[Captioner] 19:43:09
 STUDY IN TERMS OF STAFFING NEEDS AND WE ALSO LOOK AT THE ACTUAL WORKING 

[Captioner] 19:43:12
HOURS FROM LAST YEAR'S EVENT, FOR A PARTICULAR

[Captioner] 19:43:15
 EVENT, TO COME UP WITH AN ESTIMATE THAT WE USE TO CALCULATE

[Captioner] 19:43:18
 THE  SPONSORSHIP AWARD.
NOW IT IS ONLY

[Captioner] 19:43:22
 AN ESTIMATE SO AT THE END OF THE DAY THERE COULD BE

[Captioner] 19:43:25
 SOME DIFFERENCES SO FOR EXAMPLE, LAST YEAR,

[Captioner] 19:43:28
 FOR A NUMBER OF EVENTS, OUR ESTIMATE WAS

[Captioner] 19:43:31
 A LITTLE HIGHER THAN THE ACTUAL CITY SERVICE COST, SO

[Captioner] 19:43:34
 SOME OF THE EVENT ORGANIZERS ACTUALLY RECEIVED A

[Captioner] 19:43:38
 REIMBURSEMENT ON TOP OF WRITING OFF THE CITY SERVICE

[Captioner] 19:43:41
 COST, THEY RECEIVED A REIMBURSEMENT TO OFFSET SOME OF THE OTHER

[Captioner] 19:43:45
 EVENT-RELATED EXPENSES.
WHILE FOR A FEW

[Captioner] 19:43:48
 OTHER EVENTS UNFORTUNATELY THE CITY SERVICE COST

[Captioner] 19:43:51
 ENDED UP BEING A LITTLE HIGHER THAN THEIR SPONSORSHIP AWARD SO THEY

[Captioner] 19:43:54
 HAD TO PAY A LITTLE BIT OF A BALANCE, AND THE BALANCE THAT WAS PAID TO THE

[Captioner] 19:43:57
 CITY RANGED FROM $1,000 TO ABOUT $2,000.


[Captioner] 19:44:01
WHEREAS SOME OF THE OTHER EVENT ORGANIZERS HAD BEEN

[Captioner] 19:44:04
 RECEIVING REIMBURSEMENTS, AGAIN

[Captioner] 19:44:08
, ANYWHERE

[Captioner] 19:44:12
 FROM $100,000 TO ACTUALLY OVER $10,000 FOR SOME OF THE

[Captioner] 19:44:15
 LARGER EVENTS BASED ON WHAT WE HAVE.


[Captioner] 19:44:19
AND AGAIN THESE ARE ESTIMATES, WE TRY OUR BEST

[Captioner] 19:44:22
 TO PROVIDE THE

[Captioner] 19:44:25
 ESTIMATES AS CLOSELY AS POSSIBLE TO WHAT WE

[Captioner] 19:44:29
 ANTICIPATE TO BE THE ACTUAL CITY

[Captioner] 19:44:32
 SERVICE THAT ARE BEING PROVIDED AT THESE SPECIAL

[Captioner] 19:44:35
 EVENTS, BUT DURING THE DAY OF THE EVENTS, WHAT WE SEE IS THAT SOMETIMES, 

[Captioner] 19:44:38
FOR EXAMPLE, WE DO NEED TO HAVE

[Captioner] 19:44:42
 ADDITIONAL STAFF HOURS BECAUSE WE

[Captioner] 19:44:46
 MAY HAVE TO CHANGE SOME ROAD CLOSURES, BECAUSE

[Captioner] 19:44:49
 OF UNFORESEEN CIRCUMSTANCE, SO IT ADDS TO THE NUMBER OF

[Captioner] 19:44:52
 HOURS STAFF ARE PRESENT.
SO IT'S NOT A GUARANTEE THAT OUR

[Captioner] 19:44:56
 ESTIMATE IS EXACTLY WHAT THE CITY SERVICE COSTS

[Captioner] 19:44:59
 WILL BE.


[Captioner] 19:45:02
SO THAT'S THE ESTIMATING PROCESS.
AND WHEN

[Captioner] 19:45:06
 WE WORK ON THE SPECIAL EVENT BUDGETING PROCESS,

[Captioner] 19:45:10
 WE CONSULT WITH FINANCE CLOSELY, AND THE APPLICATIONS ARE DUE

[Captioner] 19:45:13
 EARLIER IN THE YEAR SO WHEN

[Captioner] 19:45:16
 WE GET THE APPLICATIONS, WE TRY TO COME UP WITH THE ESTIMATES AND USUALLY 

[Captioner] 19:45:19
AT THE TIME, WE HAVE A SPECIFIC FIGURE THAT WE WORK WITH FINANCE AND FINANCE

[Captioner] 19:45:23
 WILL COME BACK AND SAY YES, THAT'S A DOABLE FIGURE

[Captioner] 19:45:26
 SO LET'S PROCEED WITH THAT.
SO IN YEARS PAST,

[Captioner] 19:45:29
 THE PROGRAM FIRST STARTED WITH

[Captioner] 19:45:33
 $250,000 FOR FISCAL YEAR 2020 AND 2020 --

[Captioner] 19:45:36
 AND THEN IN FISCAL YEAR 2021 AND 22, IT WAS

[Captioner] 19:45:39
 INCREASED TO $300,000, AND THAT WAS AT THE TIME

[Captioner] 19:45:42
 SUFFICIENT TO COVER ALL OF THE ESTIMATED

[Captioner] 19:45:45
 COSTS FOR ALL SPECIAL EVENTS THAT APPLY.


[Captioner] 19:45:48
THIS YEAR WHEN WE FIRST RECEIVED ALL OF THE APPLICATIONS, WE WENT THROUGH

[Captioner] 19:45:52
 THAT COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW PROCESS AGAIN, AND

[Captioner] 19:45:55
 AT THAT TIME, WE WERE STILL LOOKING AT

[Captioner] 19:45:58
 ROUGHLY $300,000 BECAUSE

[Captioner] 19:46:02
 AS CITY MANAGER KARENA SHACKELFORD MENTIONED, SOME OF THE SERVICE

[Captioner] 19:46:05
 COST, THE ESTIMATES ACTUALLY WENT UP AND SOME ACTUALLY WENT DOWN, BECAUSE 

[Captioner] 19:46:08
WE'VE HAD SOME EXPENSES LAST YEAR WHERE WE'VE

[Captioner] 19:46:12
 EXECUTED THE EVENT A LITTLE

[Captioner] 19:46:15
 DIFFERENTLY, SO WE NOW UNDERSTAND THAT FOR SOME OF

[Captioner] 19:46:19
 THESE EVENTS, THE COST IS A LITTLE LOWER THAN YEARS PAST VERSUS THE

[Captioner] 19:46:22
 COST BEING A LITTLE HIGHER.
SO THEN WHEN THE APPLICATIONS CAME

[Captioner] 19:46:25
 IN, WE HAD $300,000 AND THAT WAS

[Captioner] 19:46:28
 WHAT WE PROPOSED TO FINANCE, AND THAT'S THE FIGURE THAT

[Captioner] 19:46:32
 WE PROPOSED FOR THE SPONSORSHIP.
AND THEN MORE RECENTLY FOR

[Captioner] 19:46:35
 SOME OF THE EVENTS, WE DID HAVE TO LOOK

[Captioner] 19:46:39
 AT SOME POSSIBLE CHANGES JUST

[Captioner] 19:46:42
 BECAUSE WE ANTICIPATE MORE STAFF NEEDS FOR

[Captioner] 19:46:46
 SOME ROAD CLOSURE CHANGES, SO AT THE END OF

[Captioner] 19:46:49
 THIS SPONSORSHIP REVIEW PROCESS,

[Captioner] 19:46:52
 OUR ESTIMATES FOR ALL OF THE EVENTS THAT CAME TO A LITTLE HIGHER

[Captioner] 19:46:56
 THAN $300,000.
IT CAME TO

[Captioner] 19:46:59
 $314,000.
SO WE'RE LOOKING AT A DELTA

[Captioner] 19:47:02
 OF 14,000.
HOWEVER

[Captioner] 19:47:07
, WE HAVE A TOTAL OF 13 ELIGIBLE EVENTS.


[Captioner] 19:47:10
THE $300,000 THAT WE PROPOSED FOR

[Captioner] 19:47:14
 THIS PROGRAM IS SUFFICIENT TO COVER MORE THAN

[Captioner] 19:47:17
 95% OF ALL OF THE CITY SERVICE COSTS

[Captioner] 19:47:21
 FOR EVERY EVENT THAT HAS APPLIED, AND THAT IS FOUND TO

[Captioner] 19:47:24
 BE ELIGIBLE.
AND I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO SAY

[Captioner] 19:47:27
 THAT THE SPONSORSHIP PROGRAM WAS DEVELOPED

[Captioner] 19:47:30
 INITIALLY TO

[Captioner] 19:47:34
 OFFSET CITY SERVICE COSTS.
I KNOW AT THE TIME A LOT OF THIS HAS 

[Captioner] 19:47:37
TO DO WITH THE BUDGET ALLOWANCE, WHAT WE CAN DO.


[Captioner] 19:47:41
IT WAS NEVER MEANT TO

[Captioner] 19:47:45
 COVER -- WE CAN NEVER GUARANTEE TO EVENT

[Captioner] 19:47:49
 ORGANIZERS THAT WE HAVE MONEY TO COVER 100% OF THEIR CITY SERVICE COST, SO

[Captioner] 19:47:52
 I'M VERY HAPPY AS A STAFF AND I'M VERY HAPPY FOR THE EVENT

[Captioner] 19:47:55
 ORGANIZERS THAT FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS, WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO COVER A 

[Captioner] 19:47:59
SIGNIFICANT CHUNK OF THEIR -- IF NOT ALL OF

[Captioner] 19:48:01
 THEIR SPECIAL EVENT CITY SERVICE COSTS.


[Captioner] 19:48:04
THIS YEAR AGAIN FOR ALL OF THE EVENT THAT APPLIED,

[Captioner] 19:48:07
 THE CALCULATIONS CAME

[Captioner] 19:48:11
 TO $314,000 FOR THE ESTIMATES, AND WORKING

[Captioner] 19:48:14
 WITH $300,000 BUDGET, SO AS OF RIGHT NOW, WE'RE LOOKING AT AWARDS THAT

[Captioner] 19:48:18
 WILL COVER 95 -- MORE THAN

[Captioner] 19:48:21
 95%, 95.5 TO BE EXACT, OF ALL OF THE CITY SERVICE

[Captioner] 19:48:24
 COSTS FOR ALL OF THESE EVENT.
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY, AFTER

[Captioner] 19:48:28
 THE EVENTS HAVE BEEN CONCLUDED WHEN WE DO THE FINAL

[Captioner] 19:48:31
 BILLING AGAINST -- THE HOURS COULD FLUCTUATE A LITTLE

[Captioner] 19:48:34
 BIT, SO SOME OF THE EVENT

[Captioner] 19:48:37
, THEY ACTUALLY STILL MAY BE GIVEN A REIMBURSEMENT TO COVER THEIR

[Captioner] 19:48:40
 OTHER RELATED EXPENSES, AND FOR A FEW OF THE

[Captioner] 19:48:44
 EVENT, THERE'S ALWAYS THE POSSIBILITY THAT THEY MAY HAVE TO PAY A

[Captioner] 19:48:47
 MINIMUM BALANCE.
IT REALLY DEPENDS ON HOW THAT EVENT 

[Captioner] 19:48:50
PLAYS OUT ON THE DAY.
AND

[Captioner] 19:48:53
 I WILL LET CAPTAIN SNELSON ADD

[Captioner] 19:48:56
 TO THE STAFFING FOR EVENTS, I DON'T KNOW IF, CAPTAIN, YOU

[Captioner] 19:48:59
 HAVE ANYTHING TO ADD?
>> City Mgr. Shackelford: I THINK THAT 

[Captioner] 19:49:00
PRETTY MUCH ANSWERS THE QUESTION, I BELIEVE.


[Captioner] 19:49:04
SO IN SHORT, THE BUDGET AMOUNT CAN BE ADJUSTED, AND IT HAS

[Captioner] 19:49:07
 BEEN ADJUSTED, AND WE CAN CONTINUE TO CONSIDER

[Captioner] 19:49:11
 THAT, AND ALSO AS AMY SAID, THE GRANT FUNDING

[Captioner] 19:49:14
 WAS NOT INTENDED TO COVER

[Captioner] 19:49:17
 EVERYTHING, BUT WE'RE VERY PLEASED THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO

[Captioner] 19:49:20
 COVER THE MAJORITY OF THE EVENT COSTS.


[Captioner] 19:49:24
>> Councilmember Salwan: THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 19:49:30
 EVERYTHING.
SO GOING FORWARD, IF WE CAN JUST LOOK 

[Captioner] 19:49:34
AT THE INCREASING COSTS AND HOW WE CAN TRY TO HELP OUR

[Captioner] 19:49:37
 NON-PROFITS AND AT THE SAME TIME, MAKE IT WORK FOR EVERYBODY.


[Captioner] 19:49:39
THIS IS A GREAT PROGRAM.
I MEAN, THE CITY IS IN A GREAT 

[Captioner] 19:49:42
SITUATION TO BE ABLE TO HELP OUR NON-PROFITS SO THEY CAN CONTINUE TO DO 

[Captioner] 19:49:45
THESE WONDERFUL PROGRAMS.
WE HAVE SOME GREAT ORGANIZATIONS HERE 

[Captioner] 19:49:48
THAT ARE REALLY DOING GREAT WORK FOR OUR COMMUNITY, SO WE WANT TO CONTINUE 

[Captioner] 19:49:51
TO SUPPORT THAT.
SO WITH THAT, I'D LIKE TO GO AHEAD AND 

[Captioner] 19:49:53
MOVE THIS FORWARD.
>> Mayor Mei: WE ALSO HAVE A COUPLE 

[Captioner] 19:49:57
MORE SPEAKERS, SO COUNCILMEMBER -- OR VICE MAYOR COX, DID YOU WANT TO ADD

[Captioner] 19:49:58
 SOMETHING?
BUT I SEE THE MOTION.


[Captioner] 19:50:03
>> Vice Mayor Cox: I HAD A CLARIFYING QUESTION AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THE

[Captioner] 19:50:06
 DETAIL AND ALL OF THE EVALUATION COMMITTEE THAT

[Captioner] 19:50:09
 REVIEWED ALL OF THESE

[Captioner] 19:50:12
 SPECIAL EVENTS APPLICATIONS, AND SUMMARIZING IT FOR

[Captioner] 19:50:16
 US THIS EVENING.
ONE QUESTION I DID HAVE

[Captioner] 19:50:19
 WAS THAT FOR -- WHEN I SEE AMBULANCE

[Captioner] 19:50:23
S, EMERGENCY AMBULANCES BASED AT THESE EVENTS, IS THAT

[Captioner] 19:50:27
 SOMETHING THAT IS ROLLED UNDER THE CITY SERVICES OR IS THAT

[Captioner] 19:50:30
 SOMETHING THAT'S CONTRACTED OUT WITH

[Captioner] 19:50:33
 EACH INDIVIDUAL ORGANIZATION?


[Captioner] 19:50:38
>> City Mgr. Shackelford: THAT'S A MATTER OF STAGING FOR THE

[Captioner] 19:50:41
 AMBULANCE COMPANY THAT PROVIDES SERVICES HERE IN THE CITY OF

[Captioner] 19:50:44
 FREMONT.
SO TO BE --

[Captioner] 19:50:47
 IT'S MORE OF A -- I WOULD CALL IT A SAFETY

[Captioner] 19:50:50
 PRECAUTION, SO TO THE EXTENT THAT WE HAVE LARGE

[Captioner] 19:50:54
 GATHERINGS, THEY WANT TO BE STAGED IN AREAS WHERE

[Captioner] 19:50:57
 THESE LARGE GATHERINGS ARE HAPPENING BECAUSE

[Captioner] 19:51:00
 THINGS ARE -- EMERGENCIES ARE MORE PRONE

[Captioner] 19:51:03
 TO OCCUR, BUT THAT'S NOT A COST THAT'S PASSED ON TO THE EVENT

[Captioner] 19:51:05
 SPONSORS.
>> Vice Mayor Cox: OH, OKAY.


[Captioner] 19:51:08
I JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY THAT PIECE THERE.


[Captioner] 19:51:09
THANK YOU.
>> City Mgr. Shackelford: OF COURSE.


[Captioner] 19:51:13
>> Vice Mayor Cox: AND WE'RE VERY EXCITED TO HAVE ALL 13 AWARDED, 13

[Captioner] 19:51:16
 APPLICATIONS, 13 AWARDED.
SO I'M VERY PLEASED ABOUT THAT.

[Captioner] 19:51:23
 Mei: YES, COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL.


[Captioner] 19:51:26

[Captioner] 19:51:29
 BEFORE THERE WAS ADDITIONAL COMMENTS.
I'LL SECOND.


[Captioner] 19:51:32
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
I THINK THAT I'M VERY SUPPORTIVE OF 

[Captioner] 19:51:35
THIS IDEA.
I KNOW THAT THIS CAME ABOUT SEVERAL

[Captioner] 19:51:39
 YEARS AGO, WE HAVE MENTIONED IN OUR COMMUNITY HOW PROUD

[Captioner] 19:51:43
 WE ARE TO HAVE SUCH A DIVERSE COMMUNITY,

[Captioner] 19:51:46
 AND THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING COMMUNITY GATHERINGS AND BRINGING THE

[Captioner] 19:51:49
 COMMUNITY TOGETHER, AND SO I THINK THAT I WANTED TO

[Captioner] 19:51:53
 ACKNOWLEDGE AND THANK MY COUNCILMEMBERS, AS WELL AS THE STAFF, 

[Captioner] 19:51:55
FOR THIS EFFORT, BECAUSE IT IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR US.


[Captioner] 19:51:58
WE HAD TALKED ABOUT THIS EARLIER

[Captioner] 19:52:01
 THIS YEAR, ABOUT WANTING TO DO MORE COMMUNITY GATHERINGS, SO I AM

[Captioner] 19:52:04
 SUPPORTIVE OF THE IDEA IN THE FUTURE OF LOOKING AT HOW WE

[Captioner] 19:52:07
 CAN ADDRESS THE BUDGET TO CONSIDER BOTH COSTS AS WELL AS

[Captioner] 19:52:11
 EXPANSION AND ENSURING THAT ALL COMMUNITIES

[Captioner] 19:52:14
 ARE ABLE TO SERVE AND PARTICIPATE.
BUT I WANTED TO ACKNOWLEDGE

[Captioner] 19:52:17
 IN PARTICULAR BOTH CAPTAIN SNELSON AS WELL AS

[Captioner] 19:52:21

[Captioner] 19:56:25

>> Mayor Mei: YES.


[Captioner] 19:56:28
>> OKAY, THANK YOU.
MY NAME IS CYNDY

[Captioner] 19:56:32
 BONYER, PRESIDENT AND CEO OF THE FREMONT CHAMBER COMMERCE.


[Captioner] 19:56:36
I'M HERE WITH SEVERAL ADVOCATES TO EXPRESS THE CHAMBER'S INTEREST IN

[Captioner] 19:56:39
 BROADENING AND STRENG STRENG THENNING OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE CITY.


[Captioner] 19:56:42
THE CHAMBER HAS SERVED THES BUSINESS COMMUNITY FOR AS LONG AS THE CITY HAS

[Captioner] 19:56:45
 BEEN INCORPORATED.
WE HAVE ASSISTED MANY BUSINESSES IN 

[Captioner] 19:56:48
ESTABLISHING THEMSELVES IN OUR COMMUNITY AS WELL AS ASSISTING MANY 

[Captioner] 19:56:52
BUSINESSES IN SUCCEEDING THROUGH BOTH PROSPEROUS AND CHALLENGING

[Captioner] 19:56:55
 TIMES.
THE CHAMBER HAS BEEN A DRIVING FORCE 

[Captioner] 19:56:57
TO HELP DEVELOP AND GROW A THRIVING COMMUNITY.


[Captioner] 19:57:01
SUPPORT IMPORTANT SOCIAL SERVICES AND PROVIDE LEADERSHIP AND

[Captioner] 19:57:03
 EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES.
WE HAVE SUPPORTED OUR BUSINESS 

[Captioner] 19:57:07
COMMUNITY WITH STRONG AND IMPACTFUL ADVOCACY EFFORTS, AND WE HAVE

[Captioner] 19:57:10
 BEEN INSTRUMENTAL IN ATTRACTING BUSINESSES TO CALL FREMONT

[Captioner] 19:57:13
 THEIR HOME.
TO CITE JUST A FEW EXAMPLES OF

[Captioner] 19:57:16
 OUR IMPACT, AT THE REQUEST OF THE CITY, WE

[Captioner] 19:57:20
 ESTABLISHED FREMONT STREET EATS AND THE FREMONT

[Captioner] 19:57:23
 BOO FEST WITH THE PRIMARY PURPOSE TO PROVIDE PLACE-MAKING ACTIVITIES FOR 

[Captioner] 19:57:26
THE GROWING DOWNTOWN DISTRICT.
THESE EVENT HAVE EXPOSED THOUSANDS OF 

[Captioner] 19:57:29
PEOPLE TO THE GROWING DOWNTOWN.
ALTHOUGH THE FREMONT

[Captioner] 19:57:33
 FESTIVAL OF THE ARTS IS A FUNDING MECHANISM FOR THE

[Captioner] 19:57:34
 CHAMBER, IT IS A BOON TO THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY.


[Captioner] 19:57:38
IT HAS RAISED NEARLY $10 MILLION FOR OUR LOCAL

[Captioner] 19:57:41
 NON-PROFITS AND COLLECTS SIGNIFICANT MONEY IN TAXES AND FEES.


[Captioner] 19:57:44
HOTELS ARE BOOKED OUT AND RESTAURANTS ARE FLOWING FOR THE WEEKEND.


[Captioner] 19:57:49
POSITIVE COVERAGE HAS BEEN FOUND ON BAY AREA NBC,

[Captioner] 19:57:51
 LIFETIME, THE FOOD CHANNEL, AND BRAVO.


[Captioner] 19:57:54
IT WOULD BE A DISSERVICE TO REGARD THESE AS JUST

[Captioner] 19:57:58
 EVENTS AS THEY ARE VERY IMPORTANT VEHICLES FOR BUSINESSES TO

[Captioner] 19:58:01
 PROMOTE THEMSELVES, GATHER POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS AND CREATE

[Captioner] 19:58:04
 AWARENESS FOR NON-PROFITS.
THIRD, WE HAVE HOSTED MULTIPLE 

[Captioner] 19:58:07
MEETINGS WITH STATE ELECTED OFFICIALS AND OUR MEMBERS WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED

[Captioner] 19:58:09
 TANGIBLE BENEFITS FROM THOSE MEETINGS.


[Captioner] 19:58:12
AND LAST, THE CHAMBER RECENTLY ATTENDED SELECT

[Captioner] 19:58:15
 USA AND REPRESENTED FREMONT AND THE BAY AREA AS PART OF THE

[Captioner] 19:58:18
 CALIFORNIA DELEGATION TO MEET WITH VARIOUS INTERNATIONAL

[Captioner] 19:58:22
 COMPANIES TO ESTABLISH THEIR

[Captioner] 19:58:25
 HEADQUARTERS IN FREMONT.
TIME PROHIBITS ME FROM CITING MORE

[Captioner] 19:58:29
 BUT THESE CLEARLY ILLUSTRATE HOW THE

[Captioner] 19:58:31
 CHAMBER HAS BEEN VIE TELL IN THIS CITY.


[Captioner] 19:58:34
THERE ARE MANY THINGS THE CHAMBER CANNOT DO WITHOUT THE CITY, AND THE 

[Captioner] 19:58:38
CITY CANNOT DO WITHOUT THE CHAMBER.
WE BELIEVE WE HAVE COME TO A

[Captioner] 19:58:41
 PLACE WHERE WE MUST FURTHER OUR COMMITMENT TO ONE ANOTHER

[Captioner] 19:58:45
 FOR THE SUCCESS OF OUR CITY.
THE SPEAKERS THAT FOLLOW ME WILL

[Captioner] 19:58:48
 SHARE STORIES OF HOW THE CHAMBER HAS BEEN INSTRUMENTAL IN

[Captioner] 19:58:51
 THEIR SUCCESS.
WE EXPECT THAT AN EXPANDED COMMITMENT 

[Captioner] 19:58:54
WILL REQUIRE ADDITIONAL CITY RESOURCES TO BE DIRECTED TO THE CHAMBER FOR

[Captioner] 19:58:58
 US TO PROPERLY ADDRESS THE CHALLENGES THAT

[Captioner] 19:59:02
 FACE OUR COMMUNITY.


[Captioner] 19:59:05
>> Mayor Mei: 28 SECONDS.
>> I AM ASKING AND ENCOURAGING YOU TO

[Captioner] 19:59:09
 WORK WITH STAFF

[Captioner] 19:59:12

[Captioner] 19:59:19
SUE NEXT SPEAKER IS JASMINE

[Captioner] 19:59:22
 BOSRAY FOLLOWED BY RHINE BHATTIE
>> GOOD EVENING, MAYOR

[Captioner] 19:59:24
 MEI AND CITY COUNCIL.
I COME TO YOU TODAY AS THE CHAIRPERSON 

[Captioner] 19:59:27
OF THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AS WELL AS THE CEO OF

[Captioner] 19:59:31
 HALLERS PHARMACY.
AS MANY OF YOU KNOW,

[Captioner] 19:59:34
 HALLERS PHARMACY HELPED THE CITY PROVIDE COVID

[Captioner] 19:59:37
 VACCINATIONS, BUT WHAT MANY OF YOU DON'T KNOW IS MARCH

[Captioner] 19:59:40
 MARCH 20 -- 2020, MY STORES WERE HIT WITH COVID.


[Captioner] 19:59:45
AND FOUR OUT OF MY SEVEN STAFF MEMBERS WERE COVID-POSITIVE,

[Captioner] 19:59:48
 AND I WAS AN ESSENTIAL BUSINESS THAT NEEDED TO

[Captioner] 19:59:50
 PROVIDE LIFE SERVING MEDICATIONS TO THE COMMUNITY.


[Captioner] 19:59:54
I COULD NOT CLOSE.
BUT MY

[Captioner] 19:59:57
 EMPLOYEES WERE SCARED TO COME BACK, I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THE CONSEQUENCES WERE

[Captioner] 20:00:03
, WHAT THE STATE MANDATES WERE AND MY FIRST CALL

[Captioner] 20:00:06
 WAS TO THE CHAMBER.
I SAID I CAN'T BE CLOSED, I NEED

[Captioner] 20:00:09
 TO BE OPEN BY TUESDAY AT THE LATEST.
AND THEY

[Captioner] 20:00:13
 PROVIDED ME RESOURCES TO HELP FIGURE OUT WHAT I COULD DO

[Captioner] 20:00:16
 TO RE-OPEN MY STORES, WHAT I COULD DO TO

[Captioner] 20:00:21
 KEEP MY STORES SAFE, HOW I COULD KEEP MY EMPLOYEES SAFE,

[Captioner] 20:00:24
 AND BASICALLY ALLOWED US THE RESOURCES TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WERE

[Captioner] 20:00:27
 PROVIDING MEDICATIONS AND CONTINUITY OF

[Captioner] 20:00:31
 CARE FOR OUR PATIENTS.
NOT ONLY DID THEY DO

[Captioner] 20:00:34
 THAT, THEN BECAME THE ALPHABET SOUP OF

[Captioner] 20:00:38
 PPP, EIDL, ALL OF THESE KIND OF PROGRAMS

[Captioner] 20:00:42
 THAT I NEEDED TO SURVIVE AS A

[Captioner] 20:00:45
 BUSINESS.
SO THE RESOURCES

[Captioner] 20:00:48
 THE CHAMBER PROVIDED US SO THAT WE COULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THOSE

[Captioner] 20:00:52
 PROGRAMS HELP IN TURN TO PROVIDE ALL OF THE

[Captioner] 20:00:55
 VACCINATION SERVICES THAT WE WERE ABLE TO PROVIDE TO THE CITY.


[Captioner] 20:00:58
IF I WAS NOT ABLE TO ACCESS THESE

[Captioner] 20:01:02
 PROGRAMS, I'M NOT SURE IF HALLERS PHARMACY OR

[Captioner] 20:01:05
 ANY OF THE PHARMACIES THAT WE WORK AT WOULD BE

[Captioner] 20:01:08
 ABLE TO SURVIVE AND PROVIDE THE SUPPORT THAT WE DID.


[Captioner] 20:01:11
AND SO WE LOOK AT THE CHAMBER FOR ALL OF THE EVENTS

[Captioner] 20:01:14
 THAT THEY DO, BUT THIS IS

[Captioner] 20:01:18
 GAME-CHANGING IN TERMS OF THE SUPPORT SERVICES THEY OFFER FOR

[Captioner] 20:01:20
 NOT JUST BUSINESSES LIKE MINE, BUT EVEN LARGE BUSINESSES.


[Captioner] 20:01:25
SO IN ECHOING WHAT

[Captioner] 20:01:28
 CYNDY IS SAYING, PLEASE UNDERSTAND THAT WE DO MORE AS A CHAMBER

[Captioner] 20:01:31
 THAN JUST THROW PARTIES.
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS THE LIFELINE

[Captioner] 20:01:33
 FOR A LOT OF BUSINESSES HERE IN FREMONT.


[Captioner] 20:01:37
SO I THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE CONSIDERATION

[Captioner] 20:01:38
 TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WE CAN DO FOR THE CITY.


[Captioner] 20:01:41
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:01:45

[Captioner] 20:01:56
HI, I'M BRIAN BOTTI, ONE OF THE ADVOCATES FOR

[Captioner] 20:01:59
 THE FREMONT CHAMBER.
AND I

[Captioner] 20:02:02
 WANTED TO SHARE WITH YOU THAT I WORK WITH

[Captioner] 20:02:06
 NUMEROUS BUSINESSES AND AS I WORK WITH THESE BUSINESS OWNER, THE COMMON

[Captioner] 20:02:09
 THREAD AMONGST THEM IS THAT THEY GET SUPPORT

[Captioner] 20:02:12
 FROM THE CHAMBERS TO HELP THEM.
AND I

[Captioner] 20:02:15
 THINK ABOUT WHAT

[Captioner] 20:02:18
 THE CHAMBER'S MAIN MISSION IS TO HELP WITH ECONOMIC

[Captioner] 20:02:23
 DEVELOPMENT, WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT, AND

[Captioner] 20:02:26
 ALSO STRENGTHEN THE

[Captioner] 20:02:29
 COMMUNITY AND THE CITY, AND I THINK THAT'S ALSO THE SAME CHARTER

[Captioner] 20:02:33
 OF THE CITY OF FREMONT.
THOSE

[Captioner] 20:02:36
 VALUES AND

[Captioner] 20:02:40
 YOUR NEEDS WANT TO GO IN THE SAME DIRECTS,

[Captioner] 20:02:44
 SO I URGE YOU TO LOOK AT YOUR BUDGET TO HELP SUPPORT THE

[Captioner] 20:02:47
 FREMONT CHAMBER.

 COMMERCE, LET ME CONGRATULATE THE CITY FOR THE

[Captioner] 20:03:04

 NUMBER ONE MINORITY-RUN COMPANY IN THE U.S. OF REVENUE OF

[Captioner] 20:05:04

THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE HAS BEEN 

[Captioner] 20:05:07
INSTRUMENTAL IN FACILITATING NETWORKING OPPORTUNITIES,

[Captioner] 20:05:10
 HELPING GROW AND DEVELOP SAFETY

[Captioner] 20:05:13

THE NEXT SPEAKER IS MATT FOLLOWED

[Captioner] 20:06:48
 BY KELLY ABREU.


[Captioner] 20:06:55
>> GOOD EVENING.
I'M DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENT AND 

[Captioner] 20:06:56
COMMUNITY AFFAIRS WITH THE FREMONT CHAMBER OF COMMERCE.


[Captioner] 20:07:01
TONIGHT YOU HAVE HEARD FROM OUR CEO ABOUT THE WORK THAT

[Captioner] 20:07:04
 THE CHAMBER HAS DONE.
YOU HAVE HEARD FROM OUR

[Captioner] 20:07:07
 MEMBERS ABOUT THE DIRECT IMPACT THE CHAMBER HAS HAD ON THE GROWTH

[Captioner] 20:07:11
 AND SUCCESS OF THEIR OWN BUSINESS.
THE CITY

[Captioner] 20:07:14
 AND CHAMBER HAVE A LONGSTANDING POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP AND WE

[Captioner] 20:07:17
 HAVE ALL WORKED TOGETHER IN VARIOUS CAPACITIES PROMOTING OUR

[Captioner] 20:07:20
 CITY.
OUR

[Captioner] 20:07:23
 REQUEST GOES BEYOND EVENT SPONSORSHIP THAT IS ALREADY DONE.


[Captioner] 20:07:26
WE'RE ASKING CITY COUNCIL TO ASK STAFF TO

[Captioner] 20:07:29
 WORK WITH THE CHAMBER TO EXPLORE OPPORTUNITIES AND

[Captioner] 20:07:33
 RESOURCES TO EXPAND THE PARTNERSHIP

[Captioner] 20:07:36
 BETWEEN THE CITY AND THE CHAMBER IN THE COMING WEEKS AND MONTHS

[Captioner] 20:07:39
.
THIS REQUEST IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE 

[Captioner] 20:07:42
THE SUCCESS WE HAVE ACHIEVED TOGETHER TO A WHOLE NEW LEVEL.


[Captioner] 20:07:46
WE CAN CONTINUE TO GROW OUR CURRENT PROGRAMMING, OUR EVENTS,

[Captioner] 20:07:50
 SUPPORTING FREMONT BUSINESSES, AND EXPANDING OUR

[Captioner] 20:07:53
 ADVOCACY EFFORTS.
WE HAVE THE CHANCE TO PARTNER TOGETHER 

[Captioner] 20:07:56
ON NEW INITIATIVES FOCUSING ON WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT,

[Captioner] 20:07:59
 INNOVATION AND OTHER PROGRAMS.


[Captioner] 20:08:02
THE OPPORTUNITIES ARE ENDLESS.
THE CHAMBER IS A PARTNER OF THE

[Captioner] 20:08:06
 CITY AND OUR WORK GOES HAND IN HAND.
WE LOOK FORWARD TO

[Captioner] 20:08:09
 WORKING WITH COUNCIL AND CITY STAFF TO IDENTIFY WAYS

[Captioner] 20:08:12
 TO EXPAND OUR PARTNERSHIP AND THE RESOURCES NEEDED

[Captioner] 20:08:15
.
WE HAVE ACCOMPLISHED SO MUCH AND CAN 

[Captioner] 20:08:18
ACHIEVE SO MUCH MORE.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THIS EVENING, 

[Captioner] 20:08:21
AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WHAT INITIATIVES WE BRING FORWARD.


[Captioner] 20:08:24
>> Ms. Gauthier: THANK YOU.
KELLY ABREU, AND THEN

[Captioner] 20:08:27
 WE'LL GO TO THE ZOOM FOR THE ADDITIONAL SPEAKERS.


[Captioner] 20:08:40
>> Vice Mayor Cox: TURN MIC ON.
>> QUICK DETOUR ON HOW

[Captioner] 20:08:43
 TO GET MONEY TO SUPPORT THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE

[Captioner] 20:08:47
.
I WOULD RECOMMEND DOING WHAT

[Captioner] 20:08:50
 I DID, I DON'T KNOW, SIX MONTH OR A YEAR AGO.


[Captioner] 20:08:54
KEEP A VERY CLOSE EYE, GO THROUGH THE COUNTY BUDGET AND

[Captioner] 20:08:57
 TRACK WHERE THEY'RE THROWING AROUND MONEY TO HELP CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE.


[Captioner] 20:09:00
A LOT OF TIMES IT'S NOT GOING TO THE FREMONT CHAMBER OF COMMERCE.


[Captioner] 20:09:04
IT'S GOING TO SOMEBODY ELSE'S CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE

[Captioner] 20:09:07
 FOR ALL THESE LITTLE TEENY SMALLER

[Captioner] 20:09:09
 CITIES.
AND IF YOU ADD IT UP, IT ADDS UP TO 

[Captioner] 20:09:12
MORE THAN FREMONT IS GETTING, SO YEAH,

[Captioner] 20:09:16
 I REALLY THINK THAT THERE'S A LOT TO BE GAINED BY KEEPING A

[Captioner] 20:09:19
 VERY CLOSE EYE ON THE COUNTY BUDGET.
BUT

[Captioner] 20:09:22
 ON THIS BUDGET THAT WE JUST -- WE JUST HEAR

[Captioner] 20:09:25
 ABOUT  TODAY, WE DIDN'T SEE ANY SLIDES

[Captioner] 20:09:28
 HERE TODAY, YOU DIDN'T SEE ANY SLIDES AT THE LAST MEETING EITHER.


[Captioner] 20:09:31
NO SLIDES.
BUT AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS

[Captioner] 20:09:34
 YEAR, THERE WAS 20 MINUTES OF BEAUTIFUL SLIDES FULL OF NUMBERS.


[Captioner] 20:09:38
AND AT THE FIRST PRESENTATION,

[Captioner] 20:09:42
 THERE WAS THIS YEAR IN MAY, THERE WAS 20 MINUTES

[Captioner] 20:09:45
 OF BUDGET SLIDES THAT CAUSED THE POLITICIANS EYES

[Captioner] 20:09:48
 TO GLAZE OVER.
BUT WHEN I SAW THOSE SLIDES,

[Captioner] 20:09:52
 I HEARD 12 MINUTES OF COUNCIL DISCUSSION FOLLOWING

[Captioner] 20:09:54
 THAT.
NOW, I COMPARE THAT TO MISSION PEAK.


[Captioner] 20:09:58
I HEARD HOURS OF MISSION PEAK.
I HEARD

[Captioner] 20:10:02
 THIS COUNCIL REALLY -- YOU

[Captioner] 20:10:05
 WERE WANTING TO SPEND ALL THE TIME IN THE WORLD ON MISSION

[Captioner] 20:10:08
 PEAK, AND I JUST DON'T SEE THAT KIND OF DEDICATION, THAT

[Captioner] 20:10:12
 KIND OF COMMITMENT TO THE BUDGET.


[Captioner] 20:10:17
AND WHAT DOES THAT END UP

[Captioner] 20:10:20
 DOING?
WELL

[Captioner] 20:10:23
, THE BUDGET IS NOT ONLY WHERE YOU'RE SPENDING

[Captioner] 20:10:27
 YOUR MONEY BUT WHERE YOU'RE FORECASTING THE MONEY TO COME

[Captioner] 20:10:30
 IN FROM.
AND IN MARCH, THIS

[Captioner] 20:10:33
 BUDGET PLANNING PEOPLE CAME IN AND SAID OH, LOOK, WE

[Captioner] 20:10:35
 FOUND $40 MILLION, IT WAS ACTUALLY 37 MILLION.


[Captioner] 20:10:39
$40MILLION OF MONEY JUST SHOWED UP HERE FROM SOME KIND

[Captioner] 20:10:42
 OF SALES TAX REVENUE.
WHICH IS ACTUALLY, WHAT, OVER 10%

[Captioner] 20:10:46
 OF YOUR BUDGET.
JUST APPEARED NINE

[Captioner] 20:10:49
 MONTHS INTO THE FISCAL

[Captioner] 20:10:53
 YEAR.
THREE QUARTERS OF YOUR PLANNING PERIOD

[Captioner] 20:10:56
 HAD ALREADY ELAPSED, AND

[Captioner] 20:10:59
 ALL OF A SUDDEN THREE QUARTERS OF THE WAY IN, WE ALL FIND

[Captioner] 20:11:02
 OUT ABOUT AN EXTRA $40 MILLION.
NOW

[Captioner] 20:11:06
 THAT'S A BEAUTIFUL AND WONDERFUL, BUT IT RAISES

[Captioner] 20:11:10
 QUESTIONS, WHY AREN'T ALL THE OTHER CITIES DECLARING

[Captioner] 20:11:12
 HUGE BUDGET SURPLUSES?
WAS THIS REALLY

[Captioner] 20:11:15
 JUST -- FREMONT HAD THIS EXPLOSION OF NEW CAR SALES?


[Captioner] 20:11:17
IS THAT WHAT WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BELIEVE?


[Captioner] 20:11:21
AN EXPLOSION OF NEW CAR SALES, ENOUGH TO GIVE YOU 10%

[Captioner] 20:11:24
 EXTRA IN THE BUDGET?


[Captioner] 20:11:28
THIS CITY COUNCIL NEEDS TO BUCKLE DOWN

[Captioner] 20:11:31
 AND EXPRESS SOME DEVOTION TO THIS TOPIC JUST LIKE YOU DO FOR

[Captioner] 20:11:34
 MISSION PEAK.


[Captioner] 20:11:40
>> Ms. Gauthier: WE'RE GOING TO ZOOM.
THE FIRST SPEAKER IS

[Captioner] 20:11:43
 DIRK LORENZ.


[Captioner] 20:11:47
>> CAN YOU HEAR ME OKAY?
>> Ms. Gauthier:

[Captioner] 20:11:48
 YES.
>> THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:11:51
MAYOR MEI AND COUNCIL, I'M DIRK LORENZ,

[Captioner] 20:11:54
 OWNER OF THE -- CAFE IN

[Captioner] 20:11:56
 CENTERVILLE AND RECENTLY RETIRED OWNER CH FREMONT FLOWERS.


[Captioner] 20:12:00
AS ONE OF THE OLDEST MEMBERS OF THE FREMONT CHAMBER OF

[Captioner] 20:12:03
 COMMERCE AND CHAIR OF THE FREMONT FESTIVAL OF THE ARTS I WANTED

[Captioner] 20:12:06
 TO ADVOCATE FOR THIS STRENGTHENED RELATIONSHIP THAT YOU'VE

[Captioner] 20:12:08
 ALREADY HEARD OTHER SPEAKERS REFER TO.


[Captioner] 20:12:11
WHEN I SERVED ON FREMONT'S PLANNING COMMISSION, AND WE

[Captioner] 20:12:15
 WERE PLANNING ON DOWNTOWN, ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT WAS ANXIOUS

[Captioner] 20:12:18
 AND ADVOCATED THAT WE PROGRAM OUR NEW

[Captioner] 20:12:21
 DOWNTOWN WITH EVENTS.
THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE DELIVERED ON

[Captioner] 20:12:24
 THAT GOAL, WHICH IN TURN GAVE ME,

[Captioner] 20:12:27
 A MEMBER OF THE CHAMBER, AN OPPORTUNITY TO MARKET MY BUSINESS

[Captioner] 20:12:31
 AT STREET EATS, THE -- AND BREW FEST AS WELL AS THE FREMONT

[Captioner] 20:12:35
 FESTIVAL OF THE ARTS.
THIS OPPORTUNITY GREATLY ASSISTED IN 

[Captioner] 20:12:38
KEEPING MY BUSINESS RELEVANT, AS THE DEMOGRAPHICS AND

[Captioner] 20:12:42
 MARKETING MEDIA CHANGED OVER TIME.
NOW AS

[Captioner] 20:12:45
 A MEMBER, I MAINTAIN THE RECORD FOR HOSTING THE MOST

[Captioner] 20:12:48
 CHAMBER MIXERS, AND THAT'S WHERE OUR MEMBERS COME

[Captioner] 20:12:52
 TOGETHER AT MY BUSINESS AS I SHOWCASE MY GOODS AND

[Captioner] 20:12:54
 SERVICES.
FREMONT FLOWERS ALSO BENEFITED FROM 

[Captioner] 20:12:58
THE VARIOUS PUBLICATIONS, THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE HAS

[Captioner] 20:13:00
 PUBLISHED OVER THE PAST 40 YEARS, WHICH INCLUDES HIGHLIGHTING MY 

[Captioner] 20:13:04
BUSINESS AND SHARING SPECIAL EERCHTS

[Captioner] 20:13:08
 EVENTS VIA INSTAGRAM,

[Captioner] 20:13:11
 FACEBOOK, OTHER

[Captioner] 20:13:15
 SOCIAL MEDIA AND REFERRALS I GET

[Captioner] 20:13:18
 OR I USED TO GET PRIOR TO RETIREMENT.
TRULY THE

[Captioner] 20:13:21
 FREMONT CHAMBER OF COMMERCE HAS BEEN AN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ENGINE FOR MY 

[Captioner] 20:13:25
SMALL BUSINESS, REACHING MAIN STREET MOM AND POP BUSINESSES, WHICH

[Captioner] 20:13:28
 ARE THE LIFEBLOOD OF OUR COMMUNITY.
AS OUR OWN

[Captioner] 20:13:31
 ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT HAS SUCCESSFULLY FOCUSED ON LARGER

[Captioner] 20:13:34
 BUSINESSES AND MANUFACTURING, THE

[Captioner] 20:13:37
 FREMONT CHAMBER OF COMMERCE HAS BEEN A LIFE LINE IN PROVIDING

[Captioner] 20:13:41
 SMALLER MAIN STREET BUSINESSES WITH THE ABILITY TO MARKET THEMSELVES TO A

[Captioner] 20:13:44
 CHANGING COMMUNITY.
I BELIEVE THAT AN EXPANDED 

[Captioner] 20:13:47
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE FREMONT CHAMBER OF COMMERCE WOULD, IN

[Captioner] 20:13:50
 ESSENCE, EXTEND THE REACH OF THE CITY'S ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT

[Captioner] 20:13:53
 DEPARTMENT, ALLOWING FINANCIAL STABILITY INTO THE

[Captioner] 20:13:57
 FUTURE.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HEARING

[Captioner] 20:14:00
 ME ON ZOOM TONIGHT.
>> Ms. Gauthier: THE NEXT SPEAKER IS

[Captioner] 20:14:04
 JOHN SCHINKEL.


[Captioner] 20:14:09
>> GOOD EVENING, MAYOR MEI AND COUNCILMEMBERS.


[Captioner] 20:14:12
ONE OF THE NEGATIVE STEREOTYPES THAT I'VE HEARD BEFORE IS THAT FREMONT IS

[Captioner] 20:14:16
 A PLACE TO SLEEP AND NOT LIVE.
AND I DON'T AGREE WITH

[Captioner] 20:14:19
 THIS, BUT ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THE FREMONT CHAMBER OF COMMERCE CONTINUE 

[Captioner] 20:14:21
TO DO GREAT WORK THAT HELPS DELETE THIS NARRATIVE.


[Captioner] 20:14:25
THESE EVENTS THAT THE CHAMBER PUTS ON

[Captioner] 20:14:27
 OUR VIBRANT AND DIVERSE COMMUNITY AND KEEP US ON THE MAP.


[Captioner] 20:14:32
THESE EVENTS BRING INCREDIBLE AMOUNTS OF FOOT TRAFFIC TO OUR AREA AND TAX

[Captioner] 20:14:35
 REVENUE BY THE DOLLARS SPENT BY VISITORS AND RESIDENTS WHO SPEND TIME 

[Captioner] 20:14:37
HERE.
THIS IS AN AMAZING INVESTMENT 

[Captioner] 20:14:40
OPPORTUNITY FOR THE CITY AND A SHOW OF SOLIDARITY TO THOSE WHO

[Captioner] 20:14:43
 VOLUNTEER THEIR TIME AND TALENT TO

[Captioner] 20:14:46
 PUT THESE EVENTS ON.
I REALLY APPRECIATE THE CITY 

[Captioner] 20:14:49
OFFSETTING THE COSTS BUT I WILL SAY

[Captioner] 20:14:52
 RESPECTFULLY THIS IS THE CITY FIXING THE FINANCIAL STRUGGLES

[Captioner] 20:14:56
 IT CREATES FOR THESE EVENTS.
EVEN STILL

[Captioner] 20:14:58
 THESE EVENTS SIMPLY DON'T HAVE THE FUNDING NEEDED TO CONTINUE.


[Captioner] 20:15:02
I'M HAPPY TO SEE EARLIER IN THE MEETING FUNDED

[Captioner] 20:15:05
 EVENTS AT 95%, NEW EVENTS IS SOMETHING THE

[Captioner] 20:15:08
 CITY SHOULD WELCOME MIGHT NOT HAPPEN.
ONE ORGANIZATION THAT

[Captioner] 20:15:11
 HAS TAKEN DISPROPORTIONATELY HIGH IMPACT IS THE FREMONT CHAMBER OF

[Captioner] 20:15:14
 COMMERCE.
THE CHAMBER HAS BEEN VITAL TO BRINGING 

[Captioner] 20:15:16
PEOPLE TO SHOP IN FREMONT.
I DO HOPE THE CITY WILL CONSIDER 

[Captioner] 20:15:19
INCREASING THEIR ALLOCATION TO THE FREMONT CHAMBER AS LOSING EXISTING AND 

[Captioner] 20:15:23
THE LOSS OF POTENTIAL EVENTS IS SOMETHING THAT WILL NEGATIVELY IMPACT

[Captioner] 20:15:25
 OUR COMMUNITY.
I'VE BEEN A PART OF SEVERAL 

[Captioner] 20:15:28
ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE MEMBERS OF THE CHAMBER AND I'VE SEEN FIRSTHAND THE

[Captioner] 20:15:33
 POSITIVE IMPACT THEIR EFFORTS HAVE FOR GIVING THE

[Captioner] 20:15:36
 BUSINESS COMMUNITY RESILIENCY AND VIBRANCY.


[Captioner] 20:15:39
I HOPE YOU'LL CONSIDER ALL THE STATEMENTS MADE THIS EVENING BEFORE

[Captioner] 20:15:42
 APPROVING THE BUDGET.
>> Ms. Gauthier: NEXT

[Captioner] 20:15:46
 SPEAKER IS KRYS

[Captioner] 20:15:51
TEN LAINE.
>> I HAVE

[Captioner] 20:15:54
 TWO SEPARATE POINTS TO MAKE, FIRST THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE CHAMBER

[Captioner] 20:15:55
 AND THE CITY AND INCREASING THAT CAPACITY.


[Captioner] 20:15:59
WITHOUT THE FREMONT CHAMBER IN THIS PAST YEAR, I WOULD HAVE BEEN

[Captioner] 20:16:01
 UNABLE TO NAVIGATE THE WATERS THROUGH THE CITY OF FREMONT.


[Captioner] 20:16:05
EVEN THOUGH I AM AN ACTIVE MEMBER OF THE NILES MAIN STREET ASSOCIATION AND

[Captioner] 20:16:08
 HAVE SUCCESSFULLY CARRIED ON DOZENS OF EVENTS

[Captioner] 20:16:11
 THROUGHOUT THE CITY OF FREMONT, ESTABLISHING A BUSINESS IS

[Captioner] 20:16:14
 A WHOLE DIFFERENT ANIMAL, BETWEEN ZONING, PLANNING AND

[Captioner] 20:16:17
 PERMITTING.
IT IS VERY DIFFICULT FOR ME TO 

[Captioner] 20:16:20
NAVIGATE THESE THINGS BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT AS COHESIVE AS YOU WOULD THINK.


[Captioner] 20:16:23
BECAUSE OF THE FREMONT CHAMBER OF COMMERCE, I'VE BEEN ABLE TO UTILIZE

[Captioner] 20:16:27
 THEIR RESOURCES TO

[Captioner] 20:16:31
 HELP NE ECONOMICALLY EFFICIENTLY MAKE THAT PROCESS FEASIBLE AND

[Captioner] 20:16:34
 EASY TO GET THROUGH.
MY SECOND POINT I WOULD LIKE TO BRING

[Captioner] 20:16:37
 UP IS THAT I NOTICED IN THE

[Captioner] 20:16:42
 BUDGET HUMAN SERVICE AGENCY IS ONLY HIR

[Captioner] 20:16:45
ING ONE FULL TIME

[Captioner] 20:16:48
 PERSON TO HELP WITH UNHOUSED

[Captioner] 20:16:52
 INDIVIDUALS, AS WELL AS ANOTHER SENIOR OFFICE SPECIALIST TO

[Captioner] 20:16:55
 SUPPORT MEDI-CAL PROGRAM ACTIVITIES.
I

[Captioner] 20:16:59
 AM NOT SEEING ANY INCREASE IN BUDGET OR FTEs ADDED

[Captioner] 20:17:02
 TO THE POLICE DEPARTMENT TO SUPPORT THE

[Captioner] 20:17:06
 MOBILE EVALUATION TEAM.
IN MY OPINION BECAUSE OF THE INCREASE 

[Captioner] 20:17:09
IN PROBLEMS WE ARE FACING WITH OUR UNHOUSED COMMUNITY GROWING, IT IS

[Captioner] 20:17:13
 SEVERELY UNDERSERVED IN OUR COMMUNITIES, AND WE ARE NOT

[Captioner] 20:17:16
 GIVING ENOUGH ATTENTION TO IT AND WE'RE NOT SERVING WHAT IT NEEDS.


[Captioner] 20:17:20
ALL WE ARE SEEING IS THESE UNHOUSED INDIVIDUALS GET

[Captioner] 20:17:23
 PUSHED AROUND THE CITY INSTEAD OF RESOURCES

[Captioner] 20:17:27
 APPROPRIATED AS THEY SHOULD BE.
I YIELD MY

[Captioner] 20:17:30
 TIME.
>> Ms. Gauthier: THAT IS THE

[Captioner] 20:17:32
 LAST SPEAKER.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:17:35
AT THIS TIME, I'LL CLOSE THE PUBLIC COMMENT.


[Captioner] 20:17:38
AND I'LL TURN IT BACK AND BEGIN WITH OUR

[Captioner] 20:17:41
 COUNCILMEMBER RAJ SALWAN.
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN.


[Captioner] 20:17:43
>> Councilmember Salwan: THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR.


[Captioner] 20:17:48
AND THANK YOU, MR. PERSSELIN, FOR GREAT WORK YOU'RE DOING.


[Captioner] 20:17:52
JUST A COUPLE QUESTIONS,

[Captioner] 20:17:55
 MR. ABREU MENTIONED THE $35 MILLION THAT SHOWED UP ALL OF A

[Captioner] 20:17:58
 SUDDEN, AS HE SAID, AND SO I

[Captioner] 20:18:02
 THINK EXPLANATION ON THAT, I THINK IT HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH STATE

[Captioner] 20:18:05
 TAXES AND HOW WE GET THE MONEY BACK, IF YOU COULD EXPLAIN THAT FOR THE

[Captioner] 20:18:09
 BENEFIT OF THE PUBLIC.
>> Mr. Persselin:

[Captioner] 20:18:12
 SO AS I THINK YOU KNOW, WE RECEIVE ALLOCATIONS OF SALES

[Captioner] 20:18:16
 TAX FROM THE STATE BECAUSE THE STATE IS THE SALES TAX

[Captioner] 20:18:19
 COLLECTOR ON A QUARTERLY BASIS IN

[Captioner] 20:18:22
 ARREARS.
TYPICALLY ABOUT TWO MONTHS.


[Captioner] 20:18:25
SO FOR EXAMPLE, YOU KNOW, THE BUDGET

[Captioner] 20:18:28
 WAS BASED ON

[Captioner] 20:18:32
 COLLECTIONS THROUGH DECEMBER,

[Captioner] 20:18:35
 LATEST PIECE OF INFORMATION WHICH WE HAD RECEIVED AT THE END OF FEBRUARY.


[Captioner] 20:18:38
SO WHEN I PROVIDED THE MID YEAR

[Captioner] 20:18:41
 BUDGET REPORT TO THE CITY COUNCIL AT THE BEGINNING OF MARCH, I

[Captioner] 20:18:44
 WAS TALKING ABOUT, YOU KNOW, ESSENTIALLY THE

[Captioner] 20:18:46
 FIRST TWO QUARTERS OF THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR.


[Captioner] 20:18:49
SO UNFORTUNATELY, WE CAN'T PREDICT WHAT'S

[Captioner] 20:18:53
 GOING TO HAPPEN WITH THE SALES

[Captioner] 20:18:56
 TAX, AND WE'RE RECEIVING

[Captioner] 20:18:57
 INFORMATION SIGNIFICANTLY AFTER THE FACT.


[Captioner] 20:19:03
SO IT'S A CHALLENGE TO TRY TO COME UP

[Captioner] 20:19:06
 WITH A GOOD FORECAST OF WHAT WE'RE

[Captioner] 20:19:09
 GOING TO RECEIVE.
AS I MENTIONED IN THE PATION, WHEN 

[Captioner] 20:19:12
 PAST WHEN I'VE TALKED

[Captioner] 20:19:15
 TO COUNCIL ABOUT SALES TAX, WE GENERALLY USE A

[Captioner] 20:19:19
 ROLLING AVERAGE OF THE

[Captioner] 20:19:22
 PRIOR EIGHT QUARTERS TO GET A SENSE OF WHAT TO EXPECT IN

[Captioner] 20:19:26
 THE FUTURE.
I THINK I SHOWED A GRAPHIC AS

[Captioner] 20:19:29
 PART OF -- MAYBE IT WAS THE YEAR-END REPORT LAST YEAR THAT SHOWED THE

[Captioner] 20:19:32
 KIND OF VOLATILITY THAT WE SEE.


[Captioner] 20:19:35
SO WHAT WE GOT IN THE LAST QUARTER ISN'T

[Captioner] 20:19:38
 NECESSARILY A GOOD INDICATOR OF WHAT WE'RE GOING TO RECEIVE IN THE

[Captioner] 20:19:41
 NEXT QUARTER OR FUTURE QUARTERS.


[Captioner] 20:19:45
SO I'M HOPING THAT WE DO HAVE MORE SURPRISES TO

[Captioner] 20:19:48
 THE UPSIDE IN THE FUTURE, BUT NO

[Captioner] 20:19:52
 GUARANTEES.
>> Councilmember Salwan:

[Captioner] 20:19:55
 WE WANT SURPRISE ON THE UP SIDE, NOT THE DOWNSIDE,

[Captioner] 20:19:56
 RIGHT?
>> Mr. Persselin: EXACTLY.


[Captioner] 20:19:59
>> Councilmember Salwan: BASED ON THE MANY YEARS I'VE BEEN HERE, THE SALES 

[Captioner] 20:20:02
TAX IS THE ONE THAT VARIES A LOT WHEREAS THE OTHERS

[Captioner] 20:20:05
 ARE VERY STEADY.


[Captioner] 20:20:09
MS. LAINE MENTIONED ABOUT THE MED TEAM, I

[Captioner] 20:20:11
 THOUGHT WE DID HIRE SOME FOLKS ON THE MED PROGRAM.


[Captioner] 20:20:15
>> Mr. Persselin: JUST TO CLARIFY, IN THE

[Captioner] 20:20:18
 2023-24 BUDGET WE'RE INCLUDING A NEW COMMUNITY SERVICE OFFICER TO ASSIST 

[Captioner] 20:20:21
WITH THE MOBILE EVALUATION TEAM AND IN ADDITION

[Captioner] 20:20:25
 IN HUMAN SERVICES, WE'RE

[Captioner] 20:20:29
 ADDING ONE CASE MANAGER TO SUPPORT HOUSING ASSISTANCE

[Captioner] 20:20:33
 PROGRAMS AND ONE HUMAN

[Captioner] 20:20:35
 SERVICES SPECIALIST TO SUPPORT HOMELESS CARE AND RESPONSE.


[Captioner] 20:20:38
>> Councilmember Salwan: THANK YOU.
AND THEN JUST SOME

[Captioner] 20:20:42
 COMMENTS, I APPRECIATE ALL THE BUSINESS OWNERS COMING

[Captioner] 20:20:45
 AND CHAMBER OF

[Captioner] 20:20:49
 COMMERCE, CHAMBER DOES A LOT OF GOOD WORK

[Captioner] 20:20:51
 AND WE APPRECIATE THE WORK YOU'RE DOING.


[Captioner] 20:20:55
COVID HAS BEEN CHALLENGING FOR ALL NON-PROFITS INCLUDING CHAMBER

[Captioner] 20:20:58
 OF COMMERCE.
SO THEY'RE DEFINITELY A GOOD PARTNER, 

[Captioner] 20:21:01
THEY DO A LOT AS FAR AS ACTIVATING OUR DOWNTOWN SO I WOULD WANT TO CONTINUE 

[Captioner] 20:21:04
TO STRENGTHEN THAT PARTNERSHIP, MAKE SURE WE'RE WORKING TOGETHER, TRYING TO

[Captioner] 20:21:08
 SUPPORT OUR LOCAL BUSINESSES AND TRYING TO CREATE A

[Captioner] 20:21:10
 ROBUST BUSINESS CLIMATE, AS WELL AS DOING LOTS OF EVENTS.


[Captioner] 20:21:14
I THINK THAT'S WHAT KEEPS FREMONT EXCITING AND MAKES PEOPLE

[Captioner] 20:21:16
 COME TO FREMONT.
SO THAT HELPS EVERYONE.


[Captioner] 20:21:20
SO I WOULD ENCOURAGE STAFF TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE 

[Captioner] 20:21:23
AND SEE HOW WE CAN COLLABORATE ON FUTURE PROJECTS AND

[Captioner] 20:21:25
 INITIATIVES.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:21:32
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
NEXT IS COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL

[Captioner] 20:21:35
.


[Captioner] 20:21:39
>> Councilmember Campbell: THANK YOU FOR THIS.


[Captioner] 20:21:42
I THINK YOU ANSWERED JUST ABOUT YOU A OF THE QUESTIONS I

[Captioner] 20:21:44
 HAD SO I APPRECIATE ALL THE WORK THAT WENT INTO THIS.


[Captioner] 20:21:48
I KNOW HOLDING THREE MEETINGS ABOUT THE BUDGET IS A LOT

[Captioner] 20:21:50
 OF WORK AND SO I JUST WANTED TO APPRECIATE YOU FOR THAT.


[Captioner] 20:21:55
I ALSO WANTED TO SAY THAT I

[Captioner] 20:21:58
 CONCUR WITH COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN ABOUT THE

[Captioner] 20:21:59
 RELATIONSHIP WITH THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE.


[Captioner] 20:22:02
I THINK THAT THEY HAVE BEEN A IMPORTANT

[Captioner] 20:22:06
 PARTNER FOR

[Captioner] 20:22:07
 FREMONT, PARTICULARLY WITH THE DOWNTOWN AREA.


[Captioner] 20:22:10
I WOULD CONCUR THAT I'D LIKE TO STRENGTHEN AND EXPAND THE

[Captioner] 20:22:14
 RELATIONSHIPS THAT WE HAVE

[Captioner] 20:22:17
 WITH THE CHAMBER.
I'M NOT SURE EXACTLY WHAT THAT WOULD 

[Captioner] 20:22:20
LOOK LIKE BUT I'M VERY INTERESTED IN HAVING ADDITIONAL CONVERSATIONS WITH

[Captioner] 20:22:23
 OUR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT TO SEE HOW WE MIGHT BE

[Captioner] 20:22:26
 ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH A MORE STRENGTHENED AND ROBUST

[Captioner] 20:22:29
 RELATIONSHIP WITH THE CHAMBER.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:22:34
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
NEXT IS VICE MAYOR COX.


[Captioner] 20:22:39
>> Vice Mayor Cox: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.


[Captioner] 20:22:42
I REALLY APPRECIATE ALL THE HARD WORK THAT HAS GONE IN.


[Captioner] 20:22:45
I KNOW WE DID ASK A LOT MORE QUESTIONS SINCE THIS IS

[Captioner] 20:22:49
 THE THIRD HEARING, AND THERE WAS A LOT MORE

[Captioner] 20:22:52
 DETAILS, THERE WAS BOOKS DELIVERED TO ALL OF US TO REVIEW OF

[Captioner] 20:22:55
 THOUSANDS OF PAGES, MAYBE NOT THAT

[Captioner] 20:22:58
 MANY, BUT THERE WAS A LOT TO READ THROUGHOUT -- FOR

[Captioner] 20:23:01
 THE BOOK, AND I APPRECIATE YOU CLARIFYING SOME OF THE PUBLIC

[Captioner] 20:23:04
 COMMENTS AS WELL.
ONE OTHER THING I DID

[Captioner] 20:23:07
 WANT TO NOTE WAS THAT WE JUST APPROVED AT OUR LAST

[Captioner] 20:23:11
 MEETING TO HAVE MATT FROM THE FREMONT CHAMBER BE

[Captioner] 20:23:14
 THE REPRESENTATIVE ON OUR CITY OF FREMONT ECONOMIC

[Captioner] 20:23:18
 DEVELOPMENT COMMISSION.
AND SO HE'S ABLE TO PROVIDE

[Captioner] 20:23:22
 INPUT ON BEHALF OF THE CHAMBER FOR

[Captioner] 20:23:25
 CITY BUSINESS THAT THEY HAVE REGULAR MEETINGS, I BELIEVE

[Captioner] 20:23:28
 EVERY OTHER MONTH.
I WAS A MEMBER FOR EIGHT YEARS PRIOR

[Captioner] 20:23:31
 TO JOINING CITY COUNCIL.
AND

[Captioner] 20:23:34
 BEFORE -- DURING MY TIME BEING OHLONE

[Captioner] 20:23:37
 COLLEGE TRUSTEE.
BUT IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE DO SUPPORT 

[Captioner] 20:23:41
OUR BUSINESSES BECAUSE IT ATTRACTS EVERYONE TO COME HERE

[Captioner] 20:23:45
 TO FREMONT, AND THE BUSINESSES

[Captioner] 20:23:48
 ARE THE BACKBONE OF OUR COMMUNITY.
AND IT

[Captioner] 20:23:52
 REPRESENTS THE DIVERSITY OF WHAT WE CAN

[Captioner] 20:23:56
 OFFER TO OUR RESIDENTS, AND ALSO IN

[Captioner] 20:23:59
 TIME OF NEED, IF IT WASN'T FOR ALL

[Captioner] 20:24:02
 THE SMALL BUSINESSES THAT

[Captioner] 20:24:05
 BAND TOGETHER, ESPECIALLY HALLERS PHARMACY THAT

[Captioner] 20:24:08
 WORKED WITH OUR CITY OF FREMONT AND INCLUDING WITH OUR FIRE DEPARTMENT TO

[Captioner] 20:24:11
 DO THE VACCINATIONS AND TO GET THE WORD

[Captioner] 20:24:14
 OUT, AND THEY EVEN WENT OUT

[Captioner] 20:24:18
 BEYOND THE -- OF FREMONT TO HELP OTHER COMMUNITIES.


[Captioner] 20:24:22
SO IT SHOWS EACH ONE OF THE

[Captioner] 20:24:25
 SUCCESSES AND ALSO WITH THE ICE SAFETY SOLUTION, I REMEMBER DOING WORK WITH

[Captioner] 20:24:29
 THEM PREVIOUSLY WHEN I WORKED AT SALES FORCE,

[Captioner] 20:24:32
 HAVING THEM BUY THE PRODUCTS THAT YOU OFFER FOR EMERGENCY SUPPLIES.


[Captioner] 20:24:36
AND SO EVEN WORKING WITH THE SCHOOL BOARD, AND BEING

[Captioner] 20:24:39
 ABLE  TO -- THOSE

[Captioner] 20:24:43
 THINGS, SO EACH ONE OF THESE BUSINESSES HAVE LED TO A LOT OF

[Captioner] 20:24:46
 SUCCESSES THAT HAVE HELPED FREMONT TO THRIVE, SO I THINK WITH THE CONTINUED

[Captioner] 20:24:49
 PARTNERSHIP AND CONTINUING WITH THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT INVOLVEMENT AND

[Captioner] 20:24:52
 OTHER MATTERS THAT

[Captioner] 20:24:56
 WE SEEK THEIR INPUT,

[Captioner] 20:24:58
 AND BE ABLE TO WORK TOGETHER AND COLLABORATE.


[Captioner] 20:25:01
SO THERE'S DIFFERENT WAYS.
AND ALSO I'D LIKE TO

[Captioner] 20:25:04
 MENTION ALSO WORKING WITH THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE IN ANY WAY THAT 

[Captioner] 20:25:08
WE CAN HELP THE BUSINESSES TO SUPPORT, BECAUSE YOU HAVE A

[Captioner] 20:25:11
 REPRESENTATIVE IN ME, REPRESENTING THE NORTHERN

[Captioner] 20:25:14
 CALIFORNIA DISTRICT EXPORT COUNCIL TO HELP SMALL BUSINESSES THRIVE.


[Captioner] 20:25:17
SO THERE'S A LOT OF AVENUES FOR ALL OF US WORKING

[Captioner] 20:25:21
 IN THE

[Captioner] 20:25:24
 DIFFERENT REALMS WITH THE CHAMBER OF

[Captioner] 20:25:27
 COMMERCE AND ALL THE EFFORTS AND EVEN SUPPORTING SOME OF THE

[Captioner] 20:25:30
 OTHER NON-BUSINESSES THAT WE HAVE IN THE AUDIENCE THAT

[Captioner] 20:25:33
 THERE MAY BE SOME OTHER COLLABORATIONS FOR

[Captioner] 20:25:36
 EXAMPLE, WE HAVE THE MEN OF THE FRATERNITY HERE IN THE AUDIENCE

[Captioner] 20:25:40
 THAT MAYBE THERE COULD BE SOME OTHER PARTNERSHIPS THAT CAN BE DONE

[Captioner] 20:25:43
 TO HELP IN THEIR INITIATIVES AND CARRYING OUT THE

[Captioner] 20:25:47
 NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS.
AND I FEEL THAT AT

[Captioner] 20:25:50
 THIS POINT, WE'RE DOING EVERYTHING THAT WE

[Captioner] 20:25:54
 NEED TO SUSTAIN

[Captioner] 20:25:57
 THE BUDGET.
SOMETIMES IT'S HARD TO PREDICT HOW 

[Captioner] 20:26:00
THINGS ARE GOING TO GO IN THE FUTURE, BECAUSE WE JUST DON'T KNOW

[Captioner] 20:26:03
 THAT CRYSTAL BALL

[Captioner] 20:26:06
 JUST YET, BUT WE DO HAVE RESERVES

[Captioner] 20:26:10
 AND CONTINGENCY PLANS IN PLACE TO MAKE SURE WE'RE ABLE TO MEET

[Captioner] 20:26:13
 OUR CURRENT FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS TO KEEP FREMONT FROM MOVING FORWARD.


[Captioner] 20:26:16
AND ALSO I JUST WANTED TO NOTE FROM THE STATE OF ADDRESS THAT WAS

[Captioner] 20:26:19
 PRESENTED A COUPLE DAYS AGO BY OUR MAYOR MEI, THAT

[Captioner] 20:26:23
 IT HIGHLIGHTED THAT

[Captioner] 20:26:26
 FREMONT'S FINANCE DEPARTMENT HAD WON A LOT OF AWARDS FOR THEIR

[Captioner] 20:26:30
 BUDGET AND PERFORMANCE AND IN CARRYING OUT AND MATCHING WHAT

[Captioner] 20:26:33
 IS THE HIGHEST STANDARDS IN

[Captioner] 20:26:35
 GOVERNMENT FINANCE.
THAT IS VERY HARD TO ACHIEVE IF YOU 

[Captioner] 20:26:39
WORKED IN THE FINANCE DEPARTMENT IN ANY GOVERNMENT

[Captioner] 20:26:42
 ENTITY IN THE PUBLIC ACCOUNTING OF THINGS, YOU ALMOST NEED A PH.D.


[Captioner] 20:26:46
SO WE THANK YOU SO MUCH, MR. PERSSELIN, AND YOUR TEAM FOR GETTING

[Captioner] 20:26:49
 US THROUGH THAT TO HELP MAKE

[Captioner] 20:26:53
 THAT WORK WITH OUR BUDGET.
BUT YOU KNOW, I THINK AT

[Captioner] 20:26:56
 THIS POINT THAT WE'VE HAD, THROUGH

[Captioner] 20:27:00
 THREE

[Captioner] 20:27:03
 HEARINGS AND I THINK WE'VE ADDRESSED ALL

[Captioner] 20:27:07
 THE PUBLIC COMMENTS UP TO AND EVEN THROUGH THIS DAY SO I'M READY

[Captioner] 20:27:10
 TO MAKE A MOTION TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THE OPERATING BUDGET BUT

[Captioner] 20:27:13
 I'LL SEEK GUIDANCE FROM OUR MAYOR IF THERE ARE OTHER COMMENTS TO BE MADE.


[Captioner] 20:27:15
>> Mayor Mei: THERE ARE OTHER SPEAKERS BUT I'LL NOTE THE MOTION.


[Captioner] 20:27:17
THANK YOU.
COUNCILMEMBER SHAO.


[Captioner] 20:27:19
>> Councilmember Shao: THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR.


[Captioner] 20:27:23
LIKE THE SPEAKERS BEFORE ME

[Captioner] 20:27:27
, I WOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS MY APPRECIATION TO THE

[Captioner] 20:27:30
 PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE CITY AND THE CHAMBER OF

[Captioner] 20:27:34
 COMMERCE.
WE ALL WITNESSED THE SUCCESSFUL

[Captioner] 20:27:36
 EVENT JUST LAST WEEK, WHERE

[Captioner] 20:27:40
 THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND THEN THE CITY OF

[Captioner] 20:27:44
 FREMONT FACILITATED THE 2023 ANNUAL STATE OF

[Captioner] 20:27:47
 THE CITY ADDRESS BY OUR

[Captioner] 20:27:51
 MAYOR, LILY MEI, AND I KNOW

[Captioner] 20:27:54
 THAT I CAN EASILY THINK OF MANY

[Captioner] 20:27:58
 OTHER SUCCESSFUL EVENTS THROUGHOUT THE CITY ORGANIZED

[Captioner] 20:28:01
 BY CHAMBER OF  COMMERCE.
WE ARE THE

[Captioner] 20:28:04
 HAPPIEST CITY IN THE U.S., AND WITH THAT, WE NEED TO

[Captioner] 20:28:07
 HAVE THE HAPPIEST BUSINESS COMMUNITY IN

[Captioner] 20:28:11
 THE CITY, AND CHAMBER OF COMMERCE HAVE BEEN PLAYING

[Captioner] 20:28:14
 A BIG ROLE IN SUPPORTING THAT COMMUNITY AND MAKING SURE

[Captioner] 20:28:18
 THAT EVERY

[Captioner] 20:28:21
ONE -- ACTUALLY THE IMPORTANCE OF THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IS NOT ONLY

[Captioner] 20:28:24
 DEMONSTRATED WHEN EVERYBODY IS DOING WELL, THE ECONOMY IS BOOMING, BUT

[Captioner] 20:28:27
 MORE SIGNIFICANTLY WHEN WE WERE GOING THROUGH THE DIFFICULT

[Captioner] 20:28:31
 TIMES OF A PANDEMIC, WHERE WE NEEDED

[Captioner] 20:28:34
 TO WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE SURE EVERYONE NOT

[Captioner] 20:28:37
 ONLY SURVIVED THE PANDEMIC,

[Captioner] 20:28:41
 BUT COULD GROW TOGETHER.
SO WITH THAT, I

[Captioner] 20:28:44
 REALLY, ONCE AGAIN, WANT TO EXPRESS MY THANKFULNESS TO

[Captioner] 20:28:48
 THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND I LOOK FORWARD

[Captioner] 20:28:51
 TO FUTURE COLLABORATIONS BETWEEN CHAMBER OF COMMERCE

[Captioner] 20:28:54
 AND THE CITY OF FREMONT.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:28:57
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
COUNCILMEMBER KENG.


[Captioner] 20:29:02
>> Councilmember Keng: THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR.


[Captioner] 20:29:06
AND SO I THINK WE ARE VERY

[Captioner] 20:29:09
 THANKFUL AND VERY BLESSED THAT FREMONT HAS BEEN ABLE TO MAINTAIN A

[Captioner] 20:29:13
 HEALTHY BUDGET AND MAKING SURE THAT ALL

[Captioner] 20:29:17
 THE STAFF ARE STILL, YOU KNOW, HERE

[Captioner] 20:29:20
 WORKING AND CONTINUE TO HIRE, AND I DO

[Captioner] 20:29:23
 WANT TO SHARE THE SENTIMENT THAT, YOU KNOW, WE DO

[Captioner] 20:29:26
 WANT TO EXPAND ON THAT CONTINUED PARTNERSHIP WITH THE CHAMBER

[Captioner] 20:29:29
 OF COMMERCE AS A SMALL -- LOCAL SMALL BUSINESS

[Captioner] 20:29:33
 OWNER MYSELF, I HAVE EXPERIENCE WITH ALL

[Captioner] 20:29:36
 THE OTHER SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS, YOU KNOW, THE DIFFICULTY THROUGH

[Captioner] 20:29:39
 COVID, AND NOW, YOU KNOW, WITH THE STORM

[Captioner] 20:29:43
 EARLIER THIS YEAR, WITH INFLATION, WITH

[Captioner] 20:29:46
 HIGH INTEREST RATE, A LOT OF US ARE STILL HAVING A HARD

[Captioner] 20:29:49
 TIME, SO THAT SUPPORT FROM THE CHAMBER IS STILL VERY

[Captioner] 20:29:53
 IMPORTANT IN MAKING SURE THAT, YOU KNOW, WE'RE GETTING ALL THE SUPPORT

[Captioner] 20:29:56
 THAT WE CAN.
AND I WANT TO SHARE REAL

[Captioner] 20:29:59
 QUICK THAT EARLIER THIS WEEK, I GOT AN

[Captioner] 20:30:02
 ARTICLE FROM DIRK LORENZ WHO SPOKE

[Captioner] 20:30:06
 EARLIER WHO HAS BEEN A LONG-TIME

[Captioner] 20:30:09
 BUSINESS OWNER HERE LOCALLY AND HE SHARED

[Captioner] 20:30:13
 THAT AN

[Captioner] 20:30:16
 ARTICLE FROM 1976 WHERE THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE WAS

[Captioner] 20:30:20
 ADVOCATING FOR THAT PARTNERSHIP THAT WE HAVE TODAY, AND BY

[Captioner] 20:30:24
 NONE OTHER THAN MARK BERNADINE, WHO WAS THE ONE

[Captioner] 20:30:27
 THAT INVENTED ACTUALLY

[Captioner] 20:30:31
 THE -- HERE IN FREMONT SO WE HAVE A LONG HISTORY OF

[Captioner] 20:30:34
 THAT PARTNERSHIP WITH THE CHAMBER AND
