19:09:57 AND THESE ARE FOR ITEMS THAT ARE NOT AGENDIZED THIS EVENING.

19:10:04 AND SO I KNOW THAT WE HAD TWO PEOPLE, ARUN -- WELL, A COUPLE PEOPLE ON THERE.

19:10:08 SO IF WE COULD ALLOCATE TWO MINUTES FOR EACH, PLEASE.

19:10:10 THANK YOU.

19:10:15 >> Ms. Gauthier: ARUN.

19:10:17 >> Mayor Mei: WELCOME, ARUN.

19:10:18 >> HELLO.

19:10:22 HELLO, REINSPECTED MAYOR AND ALL COUNCILMEMBERS.

19:10:29 I'M HERE TO TALK ABOUT THE WILLIAMSON SITE LAND THAT WAS GIVEN TO FUSD BUT 
19:10:31 THE CITY INTENDS TO TAKE IT BACK IN OCTOBER 2022.

19:10:38 PROJECTS SUCH AS -- AND FREMONT HUB WITH CAN TOES WILL ADD DMABDZ FOR 
19:10:38 SCHOOLS.

19:10:42 ONCE THIS LAND IS BUILT INTO HOUSES IT CANNOT BE REVERSED TO BUILD AN 
19:10:42 ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

19:10:49 IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO TAKE THE LAND AWAY FROM FUSD BECAUSE IT'S BEEN COVID 
19:10:51 AND THEY HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO BUILD IT.

19:10:57 WE HAVE PUT IN A LOT OF MONEY INTO IT AND SHOULD BE GIVEN THE TIME TO BUILD 
19:10:58 THE SCHOOL WHEN THEY NEED IT.

19:11:02 MARSHALL SITES GIVEN TO FUSD IS NOT APPROVED FOR SCHOOL.

19:11:07 SO PLEASE USE THAT FOR HOUSING.

19:11:09 AS HOUSING CAN BE BUILT THERE.

19:11:15 I'M ASKING THE CITY TO WORK WITH FUSD IN GOOD FAITH AS A TRUE PARTNER AND 
19:11:18 NOT TAKE AWAY THE WILLIAMSON SITE FROM FUTURE STUDENTS.

19:11:19 THANK YOU.

19:11:25 >> Mayor Mei: THANKS.

19:11:28 NEXT SPEAKER IS SANGEETA.

19:11:32 I ALSO WANTED TO CLARIFY, THAT SITE IS DEDICATED PARKLAND OR IT HAD BEEN 
19:11:35 SOMETHING THAT HAD BEEN EXCHANGED, IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT CAN BE BUILT INTO 
19:11:37 HOUSES, JUST TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND.

19:11:43 SANGEETA, PLEASE.

19:11:43 >> HI.

19:11:44 CAN YOU HEAR ME?

19:11:44 >> Mayor Mei: YES.

19:11:45 >> OKAY, WONDERFUL.

19:11:48 SO GOOD EVENING, COUNCILMEMBERS.

19:11:51 AND THE MAYOR AND THE VICE  MAYOR.

19:11:56 I'M ACTUALLY GOING TO BE THE SAYING THE SAME THING THAT ARUN HAS BROUGHT OUT, 
19:12:01 SO I'M ALSO HERE TO TALK ABOUT THE WILLIAMSON SITE, AND I'M REALLY HOPING 
19:12:04 THAT THAT SITE CAN BE USED TO BUILD SCHOOLS.

19:12:09 SO MAYOR, I WAS NOT CLEAR WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT SOMETHING  EARLIER, BUT I'M 
19:12:14 HOPING THAT THE CITY WILL NOT TAKE THE LAND  BACK, AND IT WILL BE -- IT WILL 
19:12:16 REMAIN WITH FUSD SO THEY COULD BUILD AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL  THERE.

19:12:24 SO -- AND ALSO, I MEAN, FREMONT IS ACTUALLY BUILDING A LOT OF CONDOS AND 
19:12:27 THERE'S A LOT OF APPROVAL GIVEN FOR HOUSES SO DEFINITELY THERE'S GOING TO 
19:12:31 BE MORE DEMAND FOR SCHOOLS, SO WE REALLY HOPE THAT THE LAND IS ACTUALLY 
19:12:33 SAVED FOR FUSD.

19:12:34 SO THAT'S ALL I HAVE.

19:12:35 THANK YOU.

19:12:37 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:12:43 NEXT SPEAKER IS GOPALAKRISHNAN.

19:12:51 >> GOOD EVENING, DEAR CITY COUNCIL.

19:12:57 THE REMOVAL OF BUSINESSES THAT RESIDENTS FREQUENT SUCH AS THE SPROUTS 
19:13:02 MARKET ARE BEING REPLACED WITH CONDOS ALONG WITH RETAIL, AND THE CITY IS 
19:13:07 ALSO THINKING ABOUT REDUCING PARKING IN GENERAL IN MANY PLACES.

19:13:09 WE ARE SEEING THAT IN SOME OF THE CITY DOCUMENTS.

19:13:13 AND ACTIONS LIKE THIS DO NOT SERVE THE INTEREST OF THE RESIDENTS OF FREMONT.

19:13:19 HOW CAN WE BE A VIBRANT DOWNTOWN WHEN WE DRIVE BUSINESSES OUT OF FREMONT?

19:13:24 OUR SALES TAX IS UP BUT IT IS NOT BEING USED TO KEEP OUR  STORES ALIVE.

19:13:29 HAVE POLICE, FIRE, SCHOOL, ROAD INFRASTRUCTURE BEING INCREASED BECAUSE 
19:13:33 OF ADDING NEW HOUSES IN FREMONT, ESPECIALLY IN CENTRAL FREMONT?

19:13:36 THEY'VE ALL REMAINED THE SAME BUT WE DON'T SEEM TO STOP BUILDING MORE 
19:13:37 HOUSES.

19:13:40 SO PLEASE, IS THIS RESPONSIBLE DEVELOPMENT?

19:13:44 DON'T WE NEED TO INCREASE OUR INFRASTRUCTURE BEFORE WE ADD THOUSANDS 
19:13:46 OF HOMES TO FREMONT?

19:13:50 IT DOES NOT APPEAR THAT THE CITY AND RESIDENTS ARE ON THE SAME PAGE THESE 
19:13:54 DAYS ON ANY TOPIC, WHETHER IT IS DEVELOPMENT, WHETHER IT IS CRIME, 
19:13:58  HOMELESSNESS, TRAFFIC, SAFETY, DOWNTOWN.

19:14:04 WHY IS THERE SUCH A BIG DISCONNECT, AND WHY DOES THE CITY NOT HAVE A COMMUNITY 
19:14:09 SURVEY THAT HAS BEEN CONDUCTED SINCE 2018 SO WE'RE COMING UP ON FOUR YEARS, 
19:14:13 DON'T YOU NEED TO KNOW WHAT THE RESIDENTS WANT INSTEAD OF PUSHING DOWN 
19:14:15 OUR THROATS THINGS THAT THE CITY THINKS WE NEED?

19:14:19 IT SHOULD BE US TELLING THE CITY WHAT WE NEED AND WE SHOULD BE WORKING 
19:14:19 TOGETHER.

19:14:26 I HOPE THIS DYNAMIC WILL CHANGE AND THE CITY WILL ENGAGE WITH THE RESIDENTS TO 
19:14:29 GIVE US WHAT WE NEED INSTEAD OF THINGS WE DO NOT NEED.

19:14:30 THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

19:14:32 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:14:35 NEXT SPEAKER IS -- AND I KNOW AT THE END I'M GOING TO MAKE A GENERAL 
19:14:40 COMMENT, NOT ON NECESSARILY THE ITEMS THAT ARE JUST BEING ADDRESSED BUT IN 
19:14:45 GENERAL IN THE PUBLIC MEETINGS, BUT NEXT SPEAKER, I'M TRYING TO FIND IT 
19:14:47 BECAUSE I APOLOGIZE --

19:14:48 >> Ms. Gauthier: JOHN HINDS.

19:14:50 >> Mayor Mei: WELCOME, JOHN.

19:14:52 >> HELLO, EVERYONE.

19:14:57 IN A COUNCIL MEETING LAST MONTH, THE IDEA OF SAFETY BONDS CAME  UP.

19:15:01 AS IT TURNS OUT, IN 2019, THE CITY HIRED A POLLING FIRM TO SURVEY LIKELY 
19:15:03 VOTERS IN FREMONT ON THIS VERY SUBJECT.

19:15:08 IF YOU LOOK AT THE MATERIALS THAT THE CITY CLERK PUBLISHED FOR TONIGHT'S 
19:15:11 PUBLIC COMS, YOU CAN SEE A LINK TO THE SURVEY RESULTS.

19:15:15 VOTERS WERE ASKED ABOUT WHAT BIGGEST PROBLEMS WERE THEY SAW IN THE CITY, 
19:15:20 VOTERS WERE ASKED WHAT THEIR FUNDING PRIORITIES WOULD BE FOR A SOURCE OF 
19:15:23 FUNDING LIKE A BOND MEASURE OR A SALES TAX, AND THEY WERE PRESENTED WITH 
19:15:25 SAMPLE BALLOT MEASURE LANGUAGE.

19:15:30 CONSISTENTLY ONE OF THE TOP CONCERNS OF VOTERS IN THE SURVEY WAS IMPROVING 
19:15:31 TRAFFIC FLOW.

19:15:37 AND THE SAMPLE BOND MEASURE LANGUAGE THAT GOT THE STRONGEST FIRST 
19:15:40 IMPRESSION HEADLINED, IMPROVING TRAFFIC FLOW.

19:15:46 YET SINCE LATE 2019, THE CITY HAS CONTINUED WITH ROADWAY CHANGES OUT OF 
19:15:51 THE VISION ZERO LABEL, WHOSE MOST VISIBLE EFFECTS HAVE BEEN TO SLOW THE 
19:15:53 FLOW OF TRAFFIC AND INCREASE CONGESTION.

19:15:57 THESE RESULTS ARE ALMOST DIAMETRICALLY OPPOSED TO THE STATED WISHES OF VOTERS 
19:15:57 IN THE SURVEY.

19:16:03 IT NO SURPRISE NOW THAT RESIDENTS HAVE BEGUN COMPLAINING LOUDLY AND 
19:16:07 FREQUENTLY AS THESE CHANGES HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED BECAUSE THE CITY HAS HAD 
19:16:10 PRETTY GOOD EVIDENCE SINCE 2019 THAT FREMONT RESIDENTS DID NOT WANT THESE 
19:16:10 THINGS.

19:16:16 THE QUESTION NOW IS, IF VOTERS HAD PASSED AN ACTUAL BALLOT MEASURE THAT 
19:16:20 GAVE TOP BILLING TO IMPROVING TRAFFIC FLOW, WOULD THE CITY THEN HAVE HONORED 
19:16:23 THOSE WISHES AND GIVEN PRIORITY TO PROJECTS THAT IMPROVE TRAFFIC FLOW, OR 
19:16:28 WOULD IT INSTEAD HAVE CONTINUED WITH THE NEARLY OPPOSITE PROJECTS IT'S BEEN 
19:16:29 PURSUING SINCE THAT SURVEY?

19:16:34 THE NEXT QUESTION IS, EVEN WITHOUT A BOND MEASURE, ONCE THE CITY LEARNED OF 
19:16:39 VOTERS' CLEAR PREFERENCES, WHY DID IT CONTINUE SPENDINGITY EXISTING FUNDS 
19:16:41 FOLLOWING AN ALMOST OPPOSITE COURSE?

19:16:46 THESE QUESTIONS, IMPORTANT MATTERS OF TRUST, WILL NEED TO BE RESOLVED BEFORE 
19:16:49 VOTERS CAN BE EXPECTED TO GO FOR ANY NEW BOND MEASURES.

19:16:49 THANK YOU.

19:16:53 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:16:54 NEXT SPEAKER.

19:16:57 >> Ms. Gauthier: MARIE.

19:16:59 MARIE HUGHES.

19:17:01 >> Mayor Mei: HI, MARIE.

19:17:02 >> HI.

19:17:02 THANKS.

19:17:03 MY NAME IS MARIE HUGHES.

19:17:07 I'M A LONG TIME RESIDENT OF FREMONT.

19:17:08 I HAVE COMMENTS ON SEVERAL TOPICS.

19:17:13 SO YESTERDAY I WAS ON THE CITY WEBSITE TRYING TO FIND A PLACE TO REPORT A 
19:17:18 PROBLEM WHEN I FOUND A PAGE THAT SAYS THE CITY ONLY ALLOWS RESIDENTS TO HAVE 
19:17:19 TWO DOGS OR FOUR CATS.

19:17:23 OR TWO DOGS AND THREE CATS.

19:17:27 I HAVE TO SAY THAT I OBJECT TO THAT, BECAUSE IT DOESN'T TAKE INTO ACCOUNT 
19:17:29 THE SIZE OF THE HOUSE OR THEIR YARD.

19:17:34 THERE ARE MANY HOMES IN MY AREA THAT COULD EASILY HAVE 10 DOGS.

19:17:39 AND THERE ARE SO MANY HOMELESS PETS THESE DAYS THAT HAVING ARBITRARY 
19:17:40 LIMITS LIKE THIS MAKES NO SENSE.

19:17:47 AND SPEAKING OF HOMELESSNESS, I WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE CITY'S 
19:17:48 SAFE PARKING PILOT PROGRAM.

19:17:54 THE STAFF HAS WORKED VERY HARD TO COME UP WITH THIS PROGRAM THAT KEEPS 
19:17:57 EVERYONE SAFE, BOTH PARTICIPANTS AND NEIGHBORS, AND I WOULD LIKE TO COMMEND 
19:17:57 THEM FOR THAT.

19:18:02 AT A RECENT MEETING FOR THE VOLUNTEERS AT THE CHRIST THE KING SITE, IT WAS 
19:18:06 MENTIONED THAT THERE HAVE BEEN VERY FEW  PROBLEMS, MOSTLY IN THE  BEGINNING 
19:18:07 AND ALL EASILY SOLVED.

19:18:11 AND I BELIEVE THAT IS BECAUSE OF THE DUE DILIGENCE OF CITY STAFF.

19:18:17 AND FINALLY, I WOULD LIKE -- SINCE SURVEYS WERE BROUGHT UP, I WOULD LIKE 
19:18:20 TO MENTION THAT THESE SORT OF AD HOC SURVEYS THAT USE SOMETHING LIKE SURVEY 
19:18:25 MONKEY ARE NOT REPRESENTATIVE AND WE NEED TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT TREATING THEM 
19:18:30 THAT WAY WHEN WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE PASEO PADRE ROAD DIET, THERE WAS A LOT 
19:18:34 OF EMPHASIS ON THAT ONE SURVEY, BUT I HAPPEN TO KNOW THAT PEOPLE AGAINST THE 
19:18:41 ROAD DIET PUBLICIZE THE LINK TO THAT SURVEY EVERYWHERE.

19:18:45 I SAW IT EVERYWHERE, AND PEOPLE IN FAVOR OF THE ROAD DIET DID NOT, SO IT 
19:18:46 WAS NOT REPRESENTATIVE AT ALL.

19:18:49 AND THIS HAPPENS A LOT, AND IT'S BEEN BROUGHT UP BEFORE.

19:18:52 SO I JUST WANTED TO REMIND THE COUNCIL THAT IF YOU WANT A REPRESENTATIVE 
19:18:57 SURVEY, IT NEEDS TO BE DONE DIFFERENTLY, AND IF IT'S AN IMPORTANT 
19:18:59 SUBJECT, I THINK YOU SHOULD DO A SCIENTIFIC SURVEY.

19:19:00 THANK YOU.

19:19:04 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:19:06 NEXT SPEAKER IS HARI IYER.

19:19:14 >> Ms. Gauthier: MADAME MAYOR, HARI IYER SUBMITTED A PDF THAT WE'RE GOING 
19:19:16 TO BE SHARING AND I'LL BE KEEPING THE TIME ON  THIS.

19:19:17 SO ALBERTO CAN SHARE THE SCREEN.

19:19:19 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:19:21 AND IT WAS ALSO DISTRIBUTED TO OUR COUNCIL.

19:19:23 >> Ms. Gauthier: CORRECT.

19:19:24 ALL RIGHT.

19:19:26 >> CAN YOU GUYS HEAR ME?

19:19:27 >> Mayor Mei: YES.

19:19:27 >> ALL RIGHT.

19:19:29 THIS IS --

19:19:32 >> HARI?

19:19:35 >> YES, THIS IS ABOUT THE SAFE PARKING PROGRAM, CHRIST THE KING CHURCH.

19:19:39 I'M DIAMETRICALLY OPPOSED TO WHAT MARIE SAID.

19:19:44 WE THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF GAPS IN THE PROGRAM IN ITS CURRENT STATE AND WE 
19:19:50 WOULD LIKE TO SEE ENHANCEMENTS LIKE SECURITY PATROL, A GATED PARKING LOT, 
19:19:54 ENTRY AND EXIT CHECKS AND I WOULD PREFER CITY COUNCIL TO GO BACK TO THE 
19:19:58 COMMENTS AT THE LAST COUNCIL MEETING WHICH TELLS YOU THE GAPS IN THE HOLES 
19:20:05 AND ENTRY AND EXIT CHECKS, ESCALATION CONTACT THAT'S 24/7 AND NEED YATD AND 
19:20:07 HEALTH AND SAFETY INSPECTION.

19:20:11 ON THE OPERATIONS SIDE WE WOULD LIKE CAMERA SURVEILLANCE, OPEN AND 
19:20:14 CONSENSUS DRIVEN COMMUNICATION ON CHANGES, CRIME STATS FROM SAFE PARKING 
19:20:16 AND NEIGHBORHOOD PROTECTION BECAUSE WE DIDN'T GET ANY OF THE ANSWERS DURING 
19:20:20 THE PREVIOUS ENGAGEMENT WITH THE CHURCH AND THEY DIRECTED US TO THE CITY AND 
19:20:24 THE CITY IS REFUSING TO HAVE A DIALOGUE WITH ANY OF US.

19:20:25 NEXT SLIDE.

19:20:26 AND WHY?

19:20:29 WHY IS THIS SO IMPORTANT FOR US?

19:20:37 BEFORE YOU SAY THESE GUYS ARE AGAINST HOMELESS, YOU'RE LOOKING AT STATS FROM 
19:20:40 THE CITY POLICE DEPARTMENTMENT.

19:20:47 AUTO THEFT AND GRAND THEFT HAVE INCREASED BY 58% AND 27%.

19:20:49 HOW ARE YOU GOING TO KEEP THEM SAFE?

19:20:50 FORGET THE NEIGHBORS.

19:20:54 HOW ARE YOU GOING TO KEEP THE SAFE PARKING LOT PEOPLE SAFE WHEN DISTRICT 
19:21:00 3, A SMALL 3, HAS AUTO THEFT AND GRAND THEFT IN DOUBLE DIGIT EXPANDED 
19:21:00 NUMBERS.

19:21:02 BEFORE YOU ALL THINK THIS IS BECAUSE THIS IS A BUSINESS DISTRICT WITH 
19:21:07 FREMONT HUB, THAT'S WHY THE CRIME STATS ARE HIGH, NO, THAT'S NOT JUST BECAUSE 
19:21:09 OF THE BUSINESSES IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD.

19:21:12 THE DISTRICT 3 SUFFERS THIS, AND WE HAVE ENOUGH EVIDENCE FROM THE 
19:21:14 NEIGHBORHOOD TO PROVE THAT THIS HAPPENS.

19:21:16 NEXT SLIDE.

19:21:18 UZ.

19:21:20 >> Ms. Gauthier: 10 SECONDS  LEFT.

19:21:21 >> THANK YOU.

19:21:23 I'LL SEE YOU ALL IN THE NEXT MEETING.

19:21:26 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:21:29 NEXT SPEAKER IS ANNA CHEN.

19:21:35 I THINK SHE'LL CONTINUE.

19:21:37 ANNA?

19:21:42 YOU'RE UNMUTED.

19:21:44 >> I WAS WAITING FOR SOMEONE TO UNMUTE ME.

19:21:47 THANKS FOR LETTING ME SPEAK AGAIN.

19:21:50 I ECHO WHAT HARI JUST MENTIONED.

19:21:54 IN LAST WEEK'S CITY COUNCIL MEETING, THE NEIGHBORHOODS WHO VOICED THEIR 
19:21:57 CONCERNS IN RAIDING THE SAFETY STANDARDS FOR THE SAFE PARKING 
19:22:05 PROGRAMS ARE PORTRAYED AS NIMBY.

19:22:09 ANYONE WHO WATCHED THE MEETING COULD SEE IT WAS CLEAR WE ARE NOT AGAINST 
19:22:12 THIS PROGRAM, INSTEAD WE WANT TO ENHANCE THE SAFE STANDARDS TO ENSURE 
19:22:16 IT'S ACTUALLY SAFE AND SCALABLE FOR BOTH THE PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS AND 
19:22:17 NEARBY NEIGHBORHOOD AND COMMUNITIES.

19:22:19 SO PLEASE ALLOW ME TO REPEAT OUR CONCERNS.

19:22:23 WE NEED CAMERAS AND GATES TO BE INSTALLED.

19:22:29 THIS IS TO ACTUALLY CLOSE THE GAP IN MAKING SURE THAT FOR THE PARTICIPANTS, 
19:22:31 IF ANYTHING  HAPPENED, WE HAVE A RECORD.

19:22:36 AND IF WE INSTALL GATES, THEN WE WILL MAKE SURE THAT ONLY THE ACTUAL SAFE 
19:22:40 PARKING PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS ARE ENTERING AND EXITING THE SITE, NOT 
19:22:42 ANYONE ELSE THAT IS OUTSIDE OF THIS PROGRAM.

19:22:45 WITHOUT THOSE BACKGROUND CHECKS.

19:22:48 AND THEN THE SECOND CONCERN IS THAT WE NEED INCREASED PATROLS IN OUR 
19:22:53 NEIGHBORHOOD, ESPECIALLY DURING WHEN THIS PROGRAM IS IN THEIR PARTICIPATION 
19:22:53 MONTH.

19:22:55 THE CURRENT PARTICIPATION MONTH IS JUNE.

19:23:00 THE CURRENT SETUP OF THE CHRIST THE KING CHURCH HAS A DAYCARE ON SITE.

19:23:06 THE DAYCARE IS CALLED KIDANGO.

19:23:09 THERE'S NO REASSURANCE THAT THE PARTICIPANTS WILL LEAVE BY THEIR 
19:23:11 ACTUAL TIME WHEN THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO CHECK OUT.

19:23:18 SO IF THAT HAPPENS, IT PUTS THIS DAYCARE IN DANGER BECAUSE THEY WILL BE 
19:23:23 VIOLATING ANY OF THE STATE CODES OF SAFETY MEASURES FOR THE DAYCARE.

19:23:27 SO THOSE ARE THE THREE MAIN TOP CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE, AND WE WANT TO 
19:23:31 MAKE SURE THAT ANYONE WHO'S LISTENING TO THIS, ESPECIALLY MARIE, WHO HAD 
19:23:34 THIS COMMENT, I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU SUPPORT THIS PROGRAM.

19:23:35 WE DO TO.

19:23:39 WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE ENHANCING THE SAFETY MEASURES AND NOT JUST 
19:23:42 SAYING THAT OKAY, IT'S GOOD TO GO, BECAUSE IT'S NOT.

19:23:44 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:23:48 NEXT SPEAKER IS KEITH PARKER.

19:23:52 >> HELLO.

19:23:56 SO WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO DO IS UNDERSTAND WHY THE CITY OF FREMONT 
19:24:00 DOES NOT HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN TO ADDRESS THE HOMELESS ISSUE THAT WE'RE 
19:24:01 ALL FACING.

19:24:07 SO IF YOU GO TO THE CITY WEBSITE ON HOMELESSNESS IN FREMONT, WHAT DO YOU SEE?

19:24:09 THE FIRST THING YOU SEE IS A REQUEST FOR DONATIONS.

19:24:10 REALLY?

19:24:14 THAT'S THE LEAD PROGRAM ON THE WEBSITE FOR ENDING HOMELESSNESS, BEGGING FOR 
19:24:15 HANDOUTS?

19:24:18 GOING DOWN THE PAGE, THERE ARE RESOURCES FOR THE HOMELESS, INCLUDING 
19:24:22 A WINTER SHELTER, WHICH WAS PERMANENTLY CLOSED THIS PAST WINTER.

19:24:26 AND A MOBILE HYGIENE SERVICE, WHICH I AM GLAD TO SEE IS NOW BACK IN SERVICE.

19:24:28 LAST TIME I LOOKED, IT WASN'T.

19:24:29 SO THAT'S GOOD.

19:24:34 WHAT I DON'T SEE IS A CLEAR TOP TO BOTTOM PLAN.

19:24:38 WHAT THE CITY SHOULD BE DOING IS IDENTIFYING AN INDIVIDUAL WHO CAN BE 
19:24:44 RESPONSIBLE FOR AND ESTABLISH A CLEAR, COHERENT PLAN TO DEAL WITH THIS ISSUE.

19:24:48 THIS INCLUDES HOW TO SPEND MONEY TO HELP THOSE FACING  HOMELESSNESS.

19:24:52 THOSE RECENTLY HOMELESS, THOSE WERE MENTAL AND ADDICTION  ISSUES, THOSE 
19:24:56 ESCAPING ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIP, AND ALL THE OTHER REASONS PEOPLE ARE FINDING 
19:25:01 THEMSELVES IN THIS POSITION, BECAUSE EACH OF THOSE CAUSES NEEDS A DIFFERENT 
19:25:02 SOLUTION.

19:25:08 UNFORTUNATELY WHAT WE'VE SEEN SO FAR IS A SCATTERED SHOT AT ACTIVITIES, MOSTLY 
19:25:11 TAKING ADVANTAGE OF WHATEVER STATE OR FEDERAL FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE.

19:25:13 THEN WE WONDER WHY THE PROBLEM PERSISTS.

19:25:17 WHAT WE NEED IS A COMPLETE COMPREHENSIVE PLAN TO DEAL WITH THE 
19:25:18 ISSUE.

19:25:21 NO ONE EXPECTS THE CITY TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM COMPLETELY.

19:25:22 NO ONE CITY CAN.

19:25:25 THERE ARE FAR TOO MANY LARGER CAUSES OF THE PROBLEM THAT ARE OUTSIDE THE SCOPE 
19:25:27 OF WHAT A SINGLE CITY CAN DO.

19:25:32 BUT WHAT WE DO EXPECT IS FOR THERE TO BE A CLEAR, WELL THOUGHT OUT PLAN THAT 
19:25:36 ADDRESSES THE PROBLEM IN THE CAPACITY THAT WE'RE ABLE.

19:25:42 WITHOUT THAT, YOU REALLY HAVEN'T EARNED THE RIGHT TO ASK FOR MORE TAX DOLLARS 
19:25:42 TO THROW AT THE PROBLEM.

19:25:43 THANK YOU.

19:25:48 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:25:54 NEXT SPEAKER IS LISA DANZ.

19:25:58 PLEASE FEEL FREE TO CHECK OUT OUR HOMELESSNESS STUDY SESSIONS WE'VE HAD 
19:26:00 OVER THE YEARS, WHICH HAS SOME MORE COMPREHENSIVE DETAILS.

19:26:14 WELCOME, LISA.

19:26:15 LISA?

19:26:17 OKAY.

19:26:22 IF SHE'S NOT AVAILABLE, WE CAN BRING UP SIVA AND COME BACK TO LISA.

19:26:30 >> Ms. Gauthier: SIVA IS  UNMUTED.

19:26:30 >> HI.

19:26:34 THIS IS SIVA.

19:26:35 CAN YOU GUYS HEAR ME?

19:26:37 >> Mayor Mei: YES, WE CAN HEAR YOU.

19:26:39 >> THANK YOU FOR THE  OPPORTUNITY.

19:26:44 SO AGAIN, I WOULD LIKE TO ACTUALLY SECOND HARI AND ANNA REGARDING THE 
19:26:49 SAFE PARKING PROGRAM IMPLEMENTED IN THE CHRIST LUTHERAN CHURCH LOCATION.

19:26:56 AS MENTIONED EARLIER, THIS LOCATION IS ALREADY VULNERABLE FROM ATTACK FROM 
19:27:00 THE HOMELESS AND TRANSIENT PEOPLE LOCATED IN THE FACTORIES BEHIND US.

19:27:06 WE HAD IN THE PAST THREE MONTHS ALONE, WE HAVE HAD MULTIPLE PEOPLE ACTUALLY 
19:27:12 COMING INTO OUR HOMES AT NIGHT, OPENING THE CARS AT LIKE 3:00 A.M., AND THERE 
19:27:17 WAS ALSO ONE HOME THAT WAS ALREADY LOOTED WHILE THERE WAS ACTUALLY FAMILY 
19:27:18 INSIDE THE HOME.

19:27:25 THE THIEVES ACTUALLY CAME IN TO THE HOUSE IN SPITE OF HEARING PEOPLE 
19:27:26 SHOUTING FROM INSIDE THE HOME.

19:27:32 THIS IS A LITTLE SCARY AND IN SPITE OF ACTUALLY -- WE WERE NOT ABLE TO NARROW 
19:27:36 DOWN WHO THE THIEVES ARE YET.

19:27:40 AND ANOTHER INSTANCE, MY FAMILY WAS DIRECTLY AFFECTED ALSO BY THIS.

19:27:46 WE HAVE A TREE BEHIND US WHICH WAS SET ABLAZE ON A NIGHT AT 10:00 P.M. WHILE 
19:27:50 WE WERE ACTUALLY SLEEPING, AND WE DIDN'T REALIZE THE TREE WAS BURNING 
19:27:55 UNTIL THE FIRE DEPARTMENT ACTUALLY WAS OUTSIDE WITH AN ALARM.

19:28:00 LUCKILY THE NEIGHBORS WERE AWAKE AND THEY ACTUALLY CALLED THE POLICE, OR 
19:28:02 ELSE I DON'T KNOW WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED THAT THE TREE WOULD HAVE 
19:28:07 FALLEN ON MY ROOF AND WE WOULD HAVE ACTUALLY CAUGHT FIRE.

19:28:12 AND IT WAS ALSO REFERRED BY THE FIRE DEPARTMENT MARSHALL THAT THESE WERE 
19:28:13 SET BY THE HOMELESS PEOPLE.

19:28:21 SO I THINK THIS IS KIND OF SERIOUS AND WHO WOULD BE TAKING THE LIABILITY IF 
19:28:26 SUCH CASE HAPPENS, I WOULD LIKE TO ASK THE CITY TO DISCUSS ABOUT ALL THESE 
19:28:28 AND DISCUSS ABOUT THE LIABILITIES BEFORE IMPLEMENTING SUCH A PROGRAM.

19:28:29 THANK YOU.

19:28:32 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:28:35 THE NEXT SPEAKER IS LISA DANZ.

19:28:37 >> ALL RIGHT.

19:28:38 IS IT WORKING THIS TIME?

19:28:39 >> Mayor Mei: YES.

19:28:40 >> OH, THANK YOU.

19:28:41 SORRY ABOUT THAT LAST TIME.

19:28:42 TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES.

19:28:44 HI, I'M LISA DANZ.

19:28:48 I LIVE IN DISTRICT 3 AND I'M SPEAKING IN FAVOR OF THE SAFE PARKING PROGRAM.

19:28:52 AND I WON'T TAKE TOO LONG AND REPEAT EVERYTHING THAT MARIE SAID, I AGREE 
19:28:55 WITH EVERYTHING THAT MARIE SAID, AND I'LL JUST ADD THAT I'VE BEEN 
19:29:00 VOLUNTEERING WITH THE SAFE PARKING PROGRAM AND IT GREAT, IT'S VERY CALM, 
19:29:04 EVERYBODY KIND OF KNOWS THE PROCEDURE, AND THE CHURCH IS  DOING A GREAT JOB 
19:29:08 SUPPORTING IT, SO I'M VERY IN FAVOR OF THE PROGRAM AND GRATEFUL THAT YOU HAVE 
19:29:08 IT.

19:29:09 THANK YOU.

19:29:11 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:29:12 NEXT SPEAKER IS JOHN.

19:29:17 >> HI.

19:29:24 THIS IS JUST A GENERAL COMMENT ON THE ROLE OF PUBLIC COMMENT AND HOW TO VIEW THIS.

19:29:31 YOU KNOW, I'VE GONE OVER SOME OF THE RECENT TRANSCRIPTS AND SUCH OF LIKE 
19:29:34 WHAT PEOPLE HAVE SAID AND, YOU KNOW, I THINK -- I MEAN, I THINK THE COUNCIL 
19:29:37 REALIZES THIS, BUT IT'S LIKE THE SAME PEOPLE OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN, 
19:29:41 LIKE LITERALLY THERE ARE LIKE 15 OR 20 PEOPLE WHO REGULARLY COME TO THE 
19:29:44 MEETINGS AND MAKE COMMENTS, AND YOU KNOW, THIS IS NOT ATYPICAL, I MEAN, 
19:29:50 THIS IS LIKE CIVIC ENGAGEMENT IS VERY LOW, YOU KNOW, BUT OFTEN WHAT IT IS, 
19:29:54 IT WILL BE A FLASH MOB OF NEIGHBORS WHO GET RILED UP ABOUT LATEST 
19:29:57 MISINFORMATION THEY SAW ON SOCIAL MEDIA OR WHATEVER.

19:30:03 YOU KNOW, I'D REALLY ENCOURAGE THE COUNCIL TO LOOK INTO -- IN TERMS OF 
19:30:09 WHEN ENGAGING IN LIKE WHAT IS THE ACTUAL PUBLIC SENTIMENT, TO USE LIKE 
19:30:15 ACTUAL SCIENTIFIC SURVEYS FOR THIS, YOU KNOW, LIKE WHAT PEOPLE SHOW UP TO 
19:30:21 COUNCIL TO TALK ABOUT WHAT APPEARS ON NEXT DOOR OR FACEBOOK OR OTHER KIND OF 
19:30:28 SOCIAL MEDIA, THESE ARE ALL VERY -- I'VE SEEN MANY TIMES AND WE'VE ALL 
19:30:31 SEEN MANY TIMES THAT THESE ARE VERY BIASED AND NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF 
19:30:34 PEOPLE'S ACTUAL VIEWS.

19:30:41 SO IN THE CASES WHERE IT IS IMPORTANT TO KNOW WHAT PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY 
19:30:47 FEELING AND  PEOPLE'S SENTIMENT ON DIFFERENT ISSUES, I WOULD ENCOURAGE 
19:30:54  THE COUNCIL TO INVESTIGATE LOOKING INTO THESE TYPE OF SCIENTIFIC SURVEYS 
19:30:57 FOR THE ISSUES THAT ARE OF GREAT IMPORTANCE TO US.

19:30:58 THAT'S IT.

19:30:59 THANKS.

19:31:01 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:31:05 THE NEXT SPEAKER IS ANKIT.

19:31:09 WELCOME.

19:31:18 >> AM I AUDIBLE?

19:31:19 >> Mayor Mei: YES, YOU ARE ON.

19:31:21 >> OKAY.

19:31:27 I'M HERE TO SAY THAT I DO NOT SUPPORT SAFE PARKING PROGRAM, NOT THE PROGRAM 
19:31:28 BUT THE  LOCATION.

19:31:32 WHICH IS AT CHRIST THE KING LUTHERAN CHURCH.

19:31:39 FOLLOWING REASONS I DO NOT SUPPORT THE LOCATION IS BECAUSE IT IS .2 MILES 
19:31:40 AWAY FROM THE KINDERGARTEN.

19:31:45 IT IS .8 MILES AWAY FROM PARKMONT ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

19:31:51 THE PARTICIPANTS ARE NOT GOING TO BE FORCED TO LEAVE BEFORE THE KIDS START 
19:31:51 GOING TO THE SCHOOL.

19:32:00 AND THE SAFE PARKING IS RIGHT OPPOSITE TO PUBLIC PARK AT THE SHINN PARK.

19:32:05 ALSO THE MOST IMPORTANT THING  IS, ACTIVITY AT THE SAFE PARKING ARE NOT 
19:32:12 GOING TO BE MONITORED, SO I'M NOT SURE HOW THE IMPROVEMENT PROCESS CAN WORK 
19:32:14 WHEN THINGS ARE NOT GETTING MONITORED.

19:32:15 THANK YOU.

19:32:19 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:32:25 AND I'M GOING TO NOW CLOSE PUBLIC COMMENT.

19:32:31 I KNOW THAT OUR CITY MANAGER WAS GOING TO MAKE A GENERAL COMMENT, I THINK.

19:32:32 I'M NOT SEEING HER HAND.

19:32:37 >> City Mgr. Shackelford: THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR.

19:32:44 ALTHOUGH THIS TOPIC WAS NOT AGENDIZED, I KNOW THE WILLIAMSON SITE CAME UP IN 
19:32:49 PUBLIC COMMENT, AND I JUST WANT TO CONFIRM FOR THE COMMUNITY THAT THE 
19:32:55 CITY CONTINUES TO BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH FUSD UNDER THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF 
19:33:01 THE CURRENT AGREEMENT UNDER WHICH THEY WOULD BUILD A SCHOOL.

19:33:07 AND AS THEY CONTINUE TO GATHER MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR ENROLLMENT 
19:33:13 PROJECTIONS, WHICH WE UNDERSTAND ARE IN A DECLINE AT THIS POINT, YOU KNOW, 
19:33:21 WE'RE CONTINUING TO BE HAPPY TO PARTNER WITH THEM ON THAT SITE.

19:33:24 WE'VE ALSO HEARD FROM THE COMMUNITY THAT THEY'RE VERY INTERESTED IN US 
19:33:32 EXPANDING OUR PARK SYSTEM, WHICH IS WHAT WE WOULD DO IF THE PROPERTY IS 
19:33:33 RETURNED TO US.

19:33:41 SO EITHER WAY, THERE IS GREAT COMMUNITY BENEFIT, WHETHER IT A SCHOOL OR 
19:33:46 EXPANDED PARKLAND, AND IF IT'S PARKLAND AND IN THE FUTURE THE SCHOOL 
19:33:51 ENROLLMENT PROJECTIONS RISE, YOU KNOW, WE'RE FLEXIBLE AND ABLE TO  PIVOT.

19:33:56 SO I JUST WANTED TO SHARE THAT INFORMATION BECAUSE I KNOW IT TOP OF 
19:33:59 MIND FOR MANY MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY.

19:34:01 SO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY, MADAME MAYOR.

19:34:03 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:34:06 I ALSO WANTED TO ENCOURAGE THE COMMITTEE -- COMMUNITY IF THEY'RE 
19:34:09 WATCHING THAT WE DO HAVE JOINT MEETINGS BETWEEN THE SCHOOL DISTRICT AND THE 
19:34:12 COUNCIL, AND THOSE OCCUR ON A QUARTERLY BASIS.

19:34:16 THEY'RE POSTED ON BOTH OF OUR WEBSITE, AND SO PEOPLE ARE INTERESTED IN 
19:34:19 ATTENDING THOSE, THOSE ARE WHERE WE HAVE UPDATES.

19:34:20 THE NEXT ONE WILL BE SEPTEMBER.

19:34:23 SO I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE DO KNOW THAT WE DO HAVE JOINT MEETINGS.

19:34:28 AND THEN ON A REGULAR -- MORE REGULAR BASIS, WE HAVE A SUBCOMMITTEE BETWEEN 
19:34:33 OUR CITY COUNCIL AND OUR SCHOOL DISTRICT, AND THOSE ARE 
19:34:36 REPRESENTATIVES, OUR TWO REPRESENTATIVES ARE COUNCILMEMBER KENG 
19:34:41 AND VICE MAYOR SALWAN, I THINK RIGHT NOW, AND THEN THERE'S TWO OF THEIR 
19:34:45 SCHOOL BOARD TRUSTEES THAT ARE ALSO REPRESENTATIVE, THAT ALSO HOLD REGULAR 
19:34:45 MEETINGS.

19:34:46 THANK YOU.

19:34:52 SO NEXT IS GOING TO BE OUR REGULARLY SCHEDULED ITEM THIS EVENING, WHICH IS 
19:34:55 ITEM 5A, WHICH IS OUR OUTDOOR COMMERCIAL PATIO ORDINANCE.

19:35:02 AND THAT IS GOING TO BE  PRESENTED WITH A PRESENTATION FROM COURTNEY PAL, 
19:35:04 WHICH IS THE ASSOCIATE PLANNER.

19:35:07 THANK YOU.

19:35:08 >> THANK YOU.

19:35:10 GOOD EVENING, MAYOR MEI AND CITY COUNCIL.

19:35:13 ALLOW ME JUST ONE SECOND TO GET MY POWERPOINT UP.

19:35:18 PERFECT.

19:35:19 THERE WE GO.

19:35:24 SO MY NAME IS COURTNEY PAL, ASSOCIATE PLANNER WITH THE  CITY'S PLANNING 
19:35:24 DIVISION.

19:35:28 I HAVE BEEN MANAGING THE CITY'S POP-UP PATIO PROGRAM FOR ABOUT THE PAST TWO 
19:35:29 YEARS.

19:35:40 THE POP-UP PATIO PROGRAM OR PUPP PROGRAM AS WE AFFECTIONATELY CALL IT 
19:35:44 WAS STARTED TO ALLOW BUSINESSES TO DEVELOP AND OPERATE OUTDOOR PATIO 
19:35:46 AREAS IN CONFORMANCE WITH COUNTY REGULATIONS TO LIMIT THE SPREAD OF 
19:35:47 COVID-19.

19:35:54 TONIGHT, CITY COUNCIL IS CONSIDERING AN OUTDOOR COMMERCIAL PATIO ORDINANCE 
19:35:58 THAT WOULD ALLOW THESE PATIOS AND OTHERS TO OPERATE LONG TERM.

19:36:06 MY PRESENTATION IS GOING TO BEGIN WITH SOME BACKGROUND ON THE POP-UP PATIO 
19:36:06 PROGRAM.

19:36:10 I'LL THEN DISCUSS OUR WORK WITH BUSINESSES TO HELP INFORM THE 
19:36:13 DEVELOPMENT OF LONG-TERM REGULATIONS.

19:36:17 I'LL HIGHLIGHT SOME KEY AREAS OF THE PROPOSED ORDINANCE AND THE PERMIT 
19:36:21 PROCESS THAT WE  DEVELOPED, INCLUDING PERMITS, DESIGN AND BUILDING CODE 
19:36:21 REQUIREMENTS.

19:36:31 SO AS I MENTIONED, THE PROGRAM WAS INSTITUTED AS REALLY A RAPID RESPONSE 
19:36:34 TO THE STATE AND  COUNTY-WIDE REGULATIONS THAT LIMITED INDOOR 
19:36:36 ACTIVITIES TO HELP STOP THE SPREAD OF  COVID-19.

19:36:42 AND THIS PROGRAM ALLOWED BUSINESSES TO CREATE AREAS FOR OUTDOOR OPERATIONS 
19:36:47 UTILIZING THE CITY'S EXISTING SPECIAL EVENTS PERMIT PROCESS.

19:36:53 MORE THAN 70 BUSINESSES HAVE RECEIVED PERMIT FOR A POP-UP PATIO TO DATE, AND 
19:37:02 THAT INCLUDES NOT ONLY RESTAURANTS, BUT ALSO PERSONAL SERVICE BUSINESSES LIKE 
19:37:09 HAIR SALONS, NAIL SERVICES, AND OTHER EDUCATIONAL PROVIDERS.

19:37:12 IN RECENT MONTHS, HOWEVER, THE NATURE OF OUTDOOR BUSINESS OPERATIONS HAS 
19:37:13 CHANGED.

19:37:19 FEWER BUSINESSES ARE OPERATING OUTDOORS THAN AT THE HEIGHT OF THE PANDEMIC.

19:37:24 WE FOUND THAT AMONG BUSINESSES THAT ARE STILL OPERATING, HOWEVER, THAT THE 
19:37:29 VAST MAJORITY WANT TO KEEP THEIR PATIO OPEN FOR ONE YEAR OR LONGER, AND THIS 
19:37:33 INDICATED TO US THAT THERE'S REALLY A NEED TO PROVIDE  LONG-TERM CERTAINTY 
19:37:37 ABOUT WHAT THE REGULATIONS FOR PATIOS MAY BE.

19:37:43 ADDITIONALLY, STAFF FEEL THAT POP-UP PATIOS ARE A GREAT RESOURCE FOR OUR 
19:37:46 SMALL BUSINESSES AND A GREAT WAY TO ADD VIBRANCY TO COMMERCIAL  AREAS.

19:37:52 AND WE WANTED TO SUPPORT BUSINESSES THAT ARE INTEREST THE IN CREATING AND 
19:37:56 EXPANDING THEIR PATIOS, AS WE CONTINUE WITH THE ECONOMIC RECOVERY FROM 
19:37:56 COVID-19.

19:38:02 SO IT WAS IMPORTANT TO US THAT ANY REGULATIONS WE PROPOSED FOR A 
19:38:07 PERMANENT PROGRAM ASSISTED LOCAL SMALL BUSINESSES RATHER THAN CREATING MORE 
19:38:07 RED TAPE.

19:38:12 AND SO TO START THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING PERMANENT  REGULATIONS, WE 
19:38:16 DISTRIBUTED A SURVEY TO POP-UP PATIO BUSINESSES DURING NOVEMBER AND 
19:38:18 DECEMBER OF 2021.

19:38:23 WE ASKED FOR THEIR FEEDBACK ON REGULATIONS THAT WE HAD SEEN 
19:38:24 IMPLEMENTED IN OTHER CITIES.

19:38:29 WITH THAT PRELIMINARY DATA IN HAND, WE GOT AROUND TO PUTTING TOGETHER SOME 
19:38:33 INITIAL IDEAS FOR POTENTIAL CHANGES TO REGULATIONS IN FREMONT.

19:38:37 WE THEN PRESENTED THOSE INITIAL IDEAS TO BUSINESSES DURING TWO SEPARATE 
19:38:39 WEBINAR EVENTS WHICH WERE HELD IN EARLY FEBRUARY.

19:38:45 ATTENDEES AT THOSE WEBINARS PROVIDED LARGELY POSITIVE FEEDBACK ON THE IDEAS 
19:38:49 THAT WE PRESENTED, AND THE ORDINANCE THAT'S BEFORE YOU TONIGHT IS 
19:38:53 CONSISTENT WITH THE REGULATIONS THAT WE DISCUSSED AT THOSE WEBINARS.

19:38:58 I'LL NOW PROCEED TO PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF THE ORDINANCE AND THE FRAMEWORK 
19:39:02 THAT IT CREATES FOR PERMANENT OUTDOOR COMMERCIAL PATIO PROGRAM.

19:39:09 RM THE ORDINANCE WOULD CREATE A NEW EXPEDITED PERMIT PROCESS.

19:39:14 ELIGIBLE BUSINESSES WOULD APPLY FOR A ONE-TIME OUTDOOR COMMERCIAL PATIO 
19:39:19 PERMIT APPLICATION, AND THAT PERMIT APPLICATION WOULD ALLOW THEM TO 
19:39:27 CONSTRUCT A PATIO, EITHER ON PRIVATE PROPERTY, ON THE SIDEWALK, OR IN 
19:39:28 ON-STREET PARKING SPACES.

19:39:36 PERMIT REVIEWS WOULD OCCUR AT THE STAFF LEVEL THROUGH A STREAMLINED PROCESS 
19:39:40 THAT WE CREATED FOR OUR POP-UP PATIO PROGRAM.

19:39:45 THE PERMIT WOULD REQUIRE A  ONE-TIME $500 FEE.

19:39:50 THERE WOULD BE NO ANNUAL PERMIT RENEWAL OR FEE WHICH WE HEARD WAS REALLY 
19:39:53 IMPORTANT TO SAVE BUSINESSES TIME AND MONEY.

19:39:58 ADDITIONALLY, STAFF ARE PROPOSING TONIGHT THAT TO FURTHER ASSIST 
19:40:03 BUSINESSES, COUNCIL ALLOCATE $40,000 OF CDBG MONEY THAT'S EARMARKED FOR 
19:40:07 ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES, AND THAT WOULD BE TO REIMBURSE QUALIFYING 
19:40:13 BUSINESSES THAT SUBMIT A PERMIT APPLICATION PRIOR TO JANUARY OF 2022.

19:40:20 OUR HOPE IS THAT THIS FEE REIMBURSEMENT WILL HELP BUSINESSES THAT WE KNOW ARE 
19:40:30 STILL STRUGGLING WITH THE EFFECTS OF COVID-19.

19:40:33 THE ORDINANCE WOULD OFFER SUBSTANTIAL FLEXIBILITY FOR BUSINESSES WITH 
19:40:37 REGARDS TO DESIGN AND TYPE OF FURNITURE  USED IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE 
19:40:37 PATIO.

19:40:45 IN TWO AREAS, ACCESSIBILITY AND THE EXTERIOR BARRIERS, BUSINESSES WOULD 
19:40:49 CHOOSE FROM A LIST OF APPROVED DESIGNS THAT HAVE BEEN COMPILED BY CITY STAFF.

19:40:56 UNDER THE CURRENT UPON UP PATIO PILOT PROGRAM, STAFF UNDERSTANDS BUSINESSS 
19:41:00 HAVE TAKEN MANY APPROACHES TO ACCESSIBILITY, AND DUE TO BUILDING 
19:41:04 CODE REQUIREMENTS, AND A DESIRE TO ENSURE THAT EVERYONE CAN USE THESE 
19:41:11 OUTDOOR SPACES, PERMANENT PATIOS WOULD BE PRIORED TO PROVIDE EITHER AN 
19:41:17 ACCESSIBLE ENTRANCE SUCH AS A CURB RAMP OR TO BUILD A FLUSH CURB.

19:41:23 BUSINESSES HAVE ALSO HAD SUBSTANTIAL FLEXIBILITY IN THE PILOT PROGRAM IN 
19:41:25 THE TYPE AND APPEARANCE OF BARRIERS THAT THEY USE.

19:41:29 THEY CAN USE TEMPORARY MATERIALS LIKE CHAIN LINK FENCING AND ORANGE MOLDED 
19:41:37 PLASTIC BUT ON A MORE PERMANENT BASIS, STAFF ARE PROPOSING THAT PERMITTED 
19:41:42  BARRIERS HAVE A HIGHER QUALITY APPEARANCE, SUCH AS WOOD OR METAL 
19:41:48 FENCING, WOODEN PA LETS, DECORATIVE PLANTERS OR DECORATIVE K RAILS.

19:41:53 THESE BARRIERS ARE DESIGNED FOR LONG TERM OPERATIONS AND WILL, THEREFORE, 
19:41:56 ALSO HELP IMPROVE THE SAFETY OF THE PATIOS.

19:42:05 FINALLY I WANT TO ADD HOW THE BUILDING REQUIREMENTS WILL IMPACT THE PERMANENT 
19:42:06 PATIOS.

19:42:10 POP-UP PATIOS ARE CONSIDERED TEMPORARY USES THAT ARE EXEMPT FROM MANY 
19:42:15 BUILDING AND FIRE CODE REQUIREMENTS ONLY APPLICABLE TO PERMANENT USES.

19:42:19 BUT OBVIOUSLY OUTDOOR COMMERCIAL PATIOS PERMITTED THROUGH THIS ORDINANCE WOULD 
19:42:23 BE CONSIDERED MORE PERMANENT USES AND THEY'D HAVE TO COMPLY WITH THE 
19:42:27 REQUIREMENT FOR PERMANENT USES IN THE BUILDING AND FIRE CODES.

19:42:31 SO THREE MAIN AREAS OF IMPACT ARE SHOWN ON THE SLIDE.

19:42:36 WE ALREADY DISCUSSED THE FIRST, WHICH WAS ACCESSIBILITY.

19:42:40 ADDITIONALLY UNDER THE PROPOSED ORDINANCE, STAFF ARE PROPOSING THAT 
19:42:45 PATIOS WOULD NEED TO BE UNDER 750 SQUARE FEET IN AREA, AND THAT'S 
19:42:50 BECAUSE AREAS OVER THIS SIZE MAY BE CONSIDERED ASSEMBLY OCCUPANCIES, WHICH 
19:42:56 WOULD TRIGGER A LONGER PERMIT AND REVIEW FOR BUILDING AND FIRE CODE 
19:42:56 REASONS.

19:43:01 FINALLY, PATIOS WOULD ALSO NEED TO UPGRADE AND SECURE THEIR TENTS, 
19:43:05 ELECTRICAL EXTENSIONS AND HEATING DEVICES TO COMPLY WITH BUILDING CODE 
19:43:06 REQUIREMENTS.

19:43:10 THE CITY DOESN'T HAVE ANY FLEXIBILITY WITH THESE REQUIREMENTS FOR PERMANENT 
19:43:10 USES.

19:43:15 THEY MUST BE IMPLEMENTED UNDER ANY PROGRAM THAT MAKES THESE TYPES OF 
19:43:19 STRUCTURES OR -- PERMANENT.

19:43:24 I WANTED TO LASTLY SPEAK ABOUT THE PROPOSED TIMELINE FOR IMPLEMENTATION 
19:43:25 OF THIS NEW PROGRAM.

19:43:32 THE PERMITTED POP-UP PATIOS WE HAVE EXISTED IN THE CITY RIGHT NOW WOULD BE 
19:43:37 ABLE TO OPERATE AS IS THROUGH DECEMBER 31ST, 2022, WITHOUT ANY CHANGES TO 
19:43:38 THEIR CURRENT PERMIT APPROVAL.

19:43:49 BY THE END OF THE YEAR, BUSINESSES WOULD NEED TO RECEIVE A PERMIT TO 
19:43:52 CONTINUE OPERATIONS OR THEY WOULD NEED TO CEASE OPERATIONS IF THEY CHOOSE TO 
19:43:52 DO SO.

19:43:57 AS I MENTIONED EARLIER, WE'RE PROPOSING BUSINESSES CAN APPLY FOR REIMBURSEMENT 
19:44:02 FOR THE $500 PERMIT FEE THROUGH THE END OF THE YEAR, WHICH YOU'LL NOTICE 
19:44:02 COINCIDES WITH THIS DEADLINE.

19:44:06 THE FEE REIMBURSEMENT WILL ASSIST BUSINESSES WITH THE COSTS OF KEEPING 
19:44:10 THEIR OUTDOOR PATIO OPEN FOR THE LONG TERM.

19:44:19 PLANNING AND ECONOMIC  DEVELOPMENT STAFF ARE ENGAGED WITH EACH PUPP 
19:44:22 BUSINESS AND WE'LL WORK CLOSELY WITH THESE BUSINESSES TO HELP THEM 
19:44:25 TRANSITION THEIR PATIOS FROM TEMPORARY INTO PERMANENT IF THEY WISH TO DO SO.

19:44:30 ADDITIONALLY, ANY NEW BUSINESS THAT DOES NOT CURRENTLY HAVE A POP-UP PATIO 
19:44:34 BUT WANTS TO ADD ONE IS ENCOURAGED TO DO SO AND WOULD SIMPLY APPLY UNDER 
19:44:36 THIS NEW PERMANENT FRAMEWORK.

19:44:40 THEY'D BE ELIGIBLE FOR THE FEE REIMBURSEMENT THROUGH THE END OF THE 
19:44:40 YEAR AS WELL.

19:44:44 SO THAT CONCLUDES MY PRESENTATION THIS EVENING.

19:44:49 STAFF'S RECOMMENDATION IS TO FIND THAT THE PROPOSED ORDINANCE IS EXEMPT FROM 
19:44:53 THE REQUIREMENTS OF CEQA, CONSISTENT WITH THE GENERAL PLAN AS DESCRIBED IN 
19:44:55 THE STAFF REPORT.

19:44:58 STAFF RECOMMEND THAT COUNCIL WAIVE THE FULL READING OF THE ORDINANCE AND 
19:45:03 INTRODUCE THE OUTDOOR COMMERCIAL PATIO ORDINANCE AS PROVIDED IN EXHIBIT A, AS 
19:45:07 WELL AS APPROVE THE FEE RESOLUTION THAT IS IN EXHIBIT B.

19:45:14 FINALLY, STAFF RECOMMEND THAT COUNCIL REALLOCATE $40,000 OF  CDBG CARES 
19:45:20 FUNDING TO PROVIDE FEE REIMBURSEMENT FOR POP-UP PATIO PERMITEES.

19:45:23 WITH THAT, I'M NOW AVAILABLE FOR ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE.

19:45:35 I'M ALSO JOINED BY MY  COLLEAGUES, DONOVAN LAZARO AND CANDICE RANKIN 
19:45:35 MUMBY.

19:45:40 IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, OTHERWISE I WILL PASS IT BACK TO THE COUNCIL.

19:45:41 >> Mayor Mei: SURE.

19:45:42 THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE PRESENTATION.

19:45:46 I'LL BEGIN WITH COUNCIL COMMENTS.

19:45:48 I SEE COUNCILMEMBER SHAO.

19:45:51 YOU HAVE SOME QUESTIONS.

19:45:53 >> Councilmember Shao: THANK  YOU, MADAME MAYOR.

19:45:54 MY QUESTION IS VERY SIMPLE.

19:46:03 FOR THE $40,000 OF FUNDING ALLOCATED FOR THE REIMBURSEMENT OF THE $500 
19:46:07 APPLICATION FEE, IT'S UP TO LIKE 80 APPLICATIONS.

19:46:15 SO I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU CAME UP WITH THIS NUMBER BASED ON THE PAST 
19:46:16 APPLICATION SITUATION.

19:46:19 SO WHAT IF THIS MONEY RUNS OUT?

19:46:24 IS THAT FIRST COME FIRST SERVE OR WOULD YOU COME BACK TO THE COUNCIL FOR MORE 
19:46:29 MONEY FOR THE REIMBURSEMENT UNTIL THE END OF THE YEAR?

19:46:32 >> THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION, COUNCILMEMBER SHAO.

19:46:40 SO BASED ON THE ACTIVITY THAT WE SAW DURING THE POP-UP PATIO PILOT WHERE 
19:46:45 THERE WERE A LOT OF BUSINESSES THAT WERE UNABLE TO OPERATE INDOORS AND 
19:46:51 WERE REALLY FORCED TO MOVE THEIR OPERATIONS OUTDOORS, THAT PEAKED AT 
19:46:52 ONLY 70 BUSINESSES.

19:46:56 SO BASED ON THE SURVEY THAT WAS PERFORMED, WE ANTICIPATE ONLY ABOUT 
19:47:02 HALF OF THOSE BUSINESSES WANTING TO CONTINUE OPERATING THEIR POP-UP PATIO.

19:47:10 WE DO ALSO ANTICIPATE THE NUMBER OF BUSINESSES  THAT WILL APPLY FOR THE 
19:47:12 NEW OUTDOOR COMMERCIAL PATIO PROGRAM THAT ARE NOT PART OF THE PILOT.

19:47:17 THAT SAID, WE FEEL VERY CONFIDENT THAT IT WOULD REMAIN UNDER THAT 80 BUSINESS 
19:47:18  THRESHOLD.

19:47:22 >> Councilmember Shao: THANK  YOU.

19:47:25 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:47:30 CLARIFYING QUESTIONS, COUNCILMEMBER JONES.

19:47:32 >> Councilmember Jones: THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR.

19:47:35 AND THANK YOU, COURTNEY, FOR THE PRESENTATION.

19:47:40 JUST A QUICK QUESTION REGARDING THE BARRIERS THAT YOU'RE GOING TO REQUIRE 
19:47:41 FOR THE POP-UP  PATIOS.

19:47:45 ARE THERE GOING TO BE DIFFERENT REQUIREMENTS FOR THOSE THAT ARE IN THE 
19:47:50 STREET TO PROTECT THEM FROM AUTOMOBILE TRAFFIC AS OPPOSED TO WHAT'S ON THE 
19:47:53 SIDEWALK OR IN A PARKING LOT, FOR EXAMPLE?

19:47:54 >> YES.

19:48:00 SO THE CITY'S PUBLIC WORKS DEPARTMENT TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING DIVISION 
19:48:06 HAS, THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF THE POP-UP PATIO PILOT PROGRAM, REVIEWED A 
19:48:09 VAST QUANTITY OF BARRIERS IN DIFFERENT LOCATIONS AND WHAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY 
19:48:14 ABLE TO DO FOR THE CREATION OF THE PERMANENT PROGRAM WAS CHOOSE THE ONES 
19:48:18 THAT MET THE ESTHETIC QUALITY THAT WE WERE GOING FOR, BUT THEN RATE THOSE 
19:48:25 FOR PARKING LOTS, FOR SIDEWALKS, FOR  STREETS, AND THEN STREETS WITHIN THAT, 
19:48:29 THERE'S SLOW STREETS, SPEED LIMITS UNDER 25 MILES PER HOUR, AND RELATIVE 
19:48:34 FASTER STREETS, 40 MILES PER HOUR, WHERE YOU NEED A MUCH BIGGER BARRIER.

19:48:37 AND SO BUSINESSES WILL HAVE THIS APPROVED LIST.

19:48:42 IT'S ACTUALLY IN THE GUIDEBOOK THAT WAS ATTACHED AS AN INFORMATIONAL ITEM TO 
19:48:46 YOUR PACKET TONIGHT, AND THE BARRIERS ARE ESSENTIALLY APPROVED NOT ONLY BY 
19:48:50 TYPE BUT ALSO BY THE LOCATION THAT THEY WILL BE PLACED.

19:48:55 SO THE SAFETY OF THE PATIO, ON THE ROADWAY IN PARTICULAR, IS DEFINITELY A 
19:48:58 GREAT CONCERN OF OURS AND ONE THAT'S BEEN ADDRESSED THROUGH THE WAY IN 
19:49:00 WHICH THE BARRIERS HAVE BEEN APPROVED FOR USE.

19:49:06 >> Councilmember Jones: OKAY.

19:49:07 THANK YOU.

19:49:08 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:49:13 NEXT CLARIFYING QUESTION OR QUESTIONS, FROM COUNCILMEMBER COX.

19:49:17 >> Councilmember Cox: THANK YOU.

19:49:26 I REALLY APPRECIATE ALL THE HARD WORK THAT'S BEEN PUT INTO MAKING THIS HERE 
19:49:29 TODAY FOR THE OUTDOOR COMMERCIAL PATIO ORDINANCE.

19:49:34 AND I JUST HAD A COUPLE OF CLARIFYING QUESTIONS.

19:49:41 I KNOW THAT THROUGHOUT THE DOCUMENT, YOU HAD MENTION ABOUT FOUR PARKING 
19:49:47 SPACES, AND WHAT DOES THAT AMOUNT TO AS THE NUMBER OF, I GUESS, TABLES OR 
19:49:49 PEOPLE?

19:49:53 WHAT DOES THAT MEAN IN TERMS OF KIND OF BREAKING IT DOWN A LITTLE BIT MORE.

19:49:55 >> DEFINITELY.

19:50:00 SO WE'VE SEEN THAT WITHIN A SPACE OF FOUR PARKING SPACES.

19:50:05 BUSINESSES CAN PROBABLY ADD BETWEEN 6 AND 10 ADDITIONAL TABLES.

19:50:09 OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE SOCIAL DISTANCING REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE PUT BACK INTO 
19:50:09 PLACE.

19:50:12 THAT NUMBER WILL BE REDUCED BY APPROXIMATELY HALF.

19:50:20 BUT THE ESTIMATE IS CURRENTLY 6 TO 10 ADDITIONAL TABLES, AND THE SIZE, I 
19:50:23 UNDERSTAND PART OF YOUR QUESTION WAS ABOUT THE ONES IN PARKING SPACES.

19:50:28 THE 750 SQUARE FOOT LIMITATION, WHICH I UNDERSTAND IS A BIT BIGGER THAN THE 
19:50:32 FOUR PARKING SPACE LIMITATION, THAT'S SPECIFICALLY TIED TO AN OCCUPANCY OF 
19:50:37 49 PEOPLE, BECAUSE THAT'S PT AMOUNT, SO THAT WILL GIVE YOU THE PERSON NUMBER 
19:50:41 AND THE TABLE NUMBER IS PROBABLY 6 TO 10.

19:50:42 >> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.

19:50:45 THAT'S VERY HELPFUL IN UNDERSTANDING THAT PIECE.

19:50:53 ONE OF THE OTHER QUESTIONS I WANTED TO UNDERSTAND, IN TERMS OF, I MEAN, SOME 
19:51:00 OF THE SMALL BUSINESSES, THEY'RE NOT EXPERTS IN DETERMINING, LIKE, BUYING 
19:51:08 WOOD, IS IT WEATHER TREATED, IS IT PEST TREATED, YOU KNOW, PRE-TREATED, DO YOU 
19:51:15 BUY TEAK OR DO YOU BUY CEDAR.

19:51:21 SO IS THERE GOING TO BE A SPEC SHEET IF THAT HE COME IN AND YOU SIT DOWN WITH 
19:51:25 THE INDIVIDUAL BUSINESS OWNERS AND GO THROUGH THOSE PARTICULAR DETAILS, 
19:51:31 BECAUSE IT COULD BE VERY EEFER WELL MING FOR A SMAWK BUSINESS AND HAVING 
19:51:35 THE STAFF AND EXPERTISE, THAT'S A LOT TO BE PUT ON THAT.

19:51:40 AND SO JUST TRYING TO SEE HOW WE COULD MAKE IT A LITTLE BIT EASIER AND JUST 
19:51:42 KIND OF UNDERSTAND THAT PART OF THE PROCESS.

19:51:47 SO YOU FILL OUT THE APPLICATION AND THEN I SEE THE WONDERFUL BOOKLET THAT 
19:51:51 YOU PUT TOGETHER, THE GUIDEBOOK, WHICH IS VERY NICE.

19:51:56 AND KIND OF WALKING THROUGH, BUT KIND OF HELP ME OUT A LITTLE BIT OF SOME OF 
19:52:00 THE DETAILS AS WE TRY TO UNDERSTAND, AS WE ROLL OUT THIS PROGRAM.

19:52:06 >> YEAH, SO DEFINITELY SHARING IDEAS BOTH FROM STAFF AND FROM BUSINESS TO 
19:52:14 BUSINESS LAB ONE OF MY FAVORITE THINGS OF WORKING ON THE PROGRAM.

19:52:18 ACTUALLY A BUSINESS CAME FORWARD PROPOSING TO USE THESE CINDER BLOCKS 
19:52:25 WITH WOOD SPANS BETWEEN THEM, AND NONE OF US AND HALF AT ANY TIME SEEN THAT 
19:52:30 BEFORE, BUT IT LOOKED GREAT FANNED HELD UP GREAT AND WE STARTED SUGGESTING 
19:52:33 THIS TO DIFFERENT BUSINESSES AROUND TOWN BECAUSE WE HAD SEEN IT USED SO 
19:52:33 SUCCESSFULLY.

19:52:43 WHEN PEOPLE CAME IN NEEDING THAT EXTRA BID OF AS -- WHAT WOULD LOOK GOOD AND 
19:52:51 ALSO BE MORE COAST EFFECTIVEMENT YOU'LL NOTICE AT THE NUMBER -- CONSTRUCTED IN 
19:52:53 THAT WAY BECAUSE WE WERE MAKING THAT SUGGESTION AND WE DEFINITELY 
19:52:57 ANTICIPATE CONTINUING TO FOSTER THAT TYPE OF COLLABORATIVE ENVIRONMENT WITH 
19:53:01 THIS PERMIT PROCESS.

19:53:04 WE SEE THIS AS OUR WAY OF  ASSISTING THE SMALL BUSINESSES NOT ONLY THROUGH 
19:53:14 THE PERMIT PROCESS BUT WITH CREATING THOSE THAT ADD VALUE FOR THIS THEM AND 
19:53:16 CONTINUE TO BE COLLABORATIVE IN THAT WAY.

19:53:21 WE DON'T HAVE SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PARTICULAR SPECS AT THIS TIME, BUT 
19:53:32 OUR -- WE DO HAVE EXAMPLES SO WE'LL CONTINUE TO DO -- RECOMMENDING 
19:53:35 PARTICULAR SUPPLIERS OR BUSINESSES GOING FORWARD.

19:53:36 >> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.

19:53:42 I THINK IT WOULD BE MOST HELPFUL AS WE'RE GOING THROUGH THE ECONOMIC 
19:53:48 RECOVERY THAT YOU HAVE SMALL BUSINESSES OR BIG BUSINESSES THAT ARE DOING SOME 
19:53:54 OF THESE THINGS, HOW CAN WE KEEP THE SUPPLIES, THE MONEY, THE RELATION 
19:53:57 SLIPS HERE IN FREMONT, AND IS THAT POSSIBLE BASED ON SOME OF YOUR 
19:54:03 SOURCING  STRATEGIES, BECAUSE A LOT OF THIS, I LOOK AT IT AS HOW CAN WE HELP 
19:54:08 THE SMALL BUSINESS HE, AND IF THERE'S PARTICULAR BUSINESSES IN FREMONT THAT 
19:54:14 CARRY ALL OF THIS INFORMATION AND THAT COULD REDUCE THE COST OF OUR OTHER 
19:54:19 SMALL BUSINESSES, ESPECIALLY AS THEY TAKE THIS TO ANOTHER LEVEL TO MAINTAIN 
19:54:24 BUSINESS, I'M JUST TRYING TO SEE IF THERE'S SOME OTHER THINGS THAT HAD 
19:54:28 BEEN THOUGHT ABOUT IN THIS TYPE OF PARTNERING, BECAUSE WE DO HAVE ALL THE 
19:54:34 WONDERFUL CHAMBERS HERE IN OUR CITY, AND LOCAL BUSINESSES, HOW CAN WE MAKE 
19:54:36 IT EVEN A MORE WIN-WIN.

19:54:41 AND I'M JUST LOOKING FOR SOME HELP IF THERE'S SOME OTHER THINGS THAT YOU'VE 
19:54:46 THOUGHT ABOUT AND HOW WE CAN KEEP THE BUSINESS HERE IN FREMONT AT BEST, YOU 
19:54:47 KNOW, LOCAL.

19:54:55 BUY LOCAL, HIRE LOCAL, ALL OF THOSE THINGS.

19:54:56 >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT SENTIMENT.

19:55:01 I THINK IT'S WORTH NOTING, WE HAVE A SMALL BUSINESS ALLY WITHIN THE 
19:55:04 ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT TEAM, SO THERE IS GOING TO BE A LOT OF HAND HOLDING FOR 
19:55:09 ALL OF THE BUSINESSES THAT ARE CURRENTLY PARTICIPATING IN THE POP-UP 
19:55:13 PATIO PILOT THAT HAVE INDICATED THAT THEY'D LIKE TO TRANSITION INTO A 
19:55:22 PERMANENT OUTDOOR PATIO SPACE, AND THAT WILL INVOLVE POTENTIAL SUPPLIERS AND 
19:55:24 EVEN OPPORTUNITIES TO PARTNER WITH SOME OF OUR LARGER COMPANIES.

19:55:28 SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT AND I'M REALLY GLAD TO 
19:55:32 HEAR THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT COUNCIL HAS BEEN THINKING ABOUT AS WELL.

19:55:37 >> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.

19:55:40 I LOOK FORWARD TO SOME OTHER DEVELOPMENTS, PROVIDING THIS IS ALL 
19:55:40 APPROVED TONIGHT.

19:55:41 ONE OTHER QUESTION I HAVE.

19:55:49 AND THAT IS, I APPRECIATE WITH THE PERMIT FEE, YOU HAVE PUT IT OUT THERE 
19:55:51 AT $500.

19:55:59 AND IT'S LIKE A ONE-TIME FEE FOR THE APPLICATION, SO IT'S LIKE A LIFETIME 
19:56:04 FEE THAT'S BEING PAID OUT OR ARE YOU COMING BACK IN A COUPLE YEARS TO ASK 
19:56:06 FOR ADDITIONAL MONEYS?

19:56:08 I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THAT PIECE OF IT.

19:56:14 I KNOW IT'S KIND OF NEW, IT'S KIND OF A FRESH IDEA, AND JUST TRYING TO 
19:56:18 UNDERSTAND THAT ASPECT OF HOW DID YOU ARRIVE AT THE $500?

19:56:18 >> DEFINITELY.

19:56:21 WELL, I WILL START OUT BY SAYING IT IS A ONE-TIME FEE.

19:56:26 THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE HEARD FROM A LOT OF OUR BUSINESSES WAS IMPORTANT TO 
19:56:30 THEM, THAT THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO COME BACK IN THE DOOR.

19:56:34 SOME CITIES HAVE IT EVERY ONE YEAR, OTHERS HAVE IT EVERY TWO OR THREE 
19:56:37 YEARS, WHATEVER THE TIMELINE WAS, WE HEARD THAT THAT WAS JUST ABSOLUTELY, 
19:56:41 YOU KNOW, A BUREAUCRATIC NIGHTMARE, TO PUT IT, YOU KNOW, ONE WAY.

19:56:43 SO WE WANTED TO STAY AWAY FROM THAT.

19:56:49 SO THERE'S GOING TO BE NO RENEWAL PROCESS THAT BUSINESSES HAVE TO IF 
19:56:49 THROUGH.

19:56:51 IT A ONE-TIME PROCESS.

19:56:57 THE $500 FEE WAS SOMETHING THAT WE ORIGINALLY STARTED OUT WITH FROM OUR 
19:56:59 SIDEWALK DINING PERMIT PROGRAM.

19:57:05 AS YOU KNOW THE CITY HAS ALLOWED SIDEWALK DINING FOR MANY YEARS, SINCE 
19:57:10 THAT IS ONE TYPE OF POP-UP PATIO, WE DECIDED TO ESSENTIALLY SEE IF THAT FEE 
19:57:11 COULD STILL BE APPLICABLE TO THIS PROGRAM.

19:57:16 SO -- BECAUSE WE OPERATE ON A COST RECOVERY BASIS, WE LOOKED AT THE 
19:57:19 AMOUNT OF TIME THAT CITY STAFF WERE ON AVERAGE SPENDING REVIEWING THESE 
19:57:24 APPLICATIONS AND ADDED THAT ALL UP AND WE ACTUALLY GOT TO A NUMBER THAT WAS 
19:57:27 ESSENTIALLY $500, ALMOST RIGHT ON THE NOSE.

19:57:31 SO WE DECIDED BECAUSE OF THE PRECEDENT AND BECAUSE IT WORKED WITH OUR COST 
19:57:35 RECOVERY  FRAMEWORK, THAT WE WOULD CONTINUE TO SUGGEST THAT FEE FOR ALL 
19:57:41 VARIOUS TYPES OF PATIOS IN ADDITION TO THE SIDEWALK ONES WHICH PREVIOUSLY HAD 
19:57:41 THAT FEE AMOUNT.

19:57:43 SO WE FELT IT WAS STRIKING A BALL ABC.

19:57:47 WE ASKED BUSINESSES ABOUT IT IN OUR SURVEY SPECIFICALLY ABOUT WHAT TYPE OF 
19:57:56 BARRIER THE $500 PERMIT FEE WOULD KIND OF CREATE, AND WE GOT TO BE HONEST A 
19:57:56 MIX OF RESPONSES.

19:58:03 WE KNOW BUSINESSES ARE STILL STRUGGLING FROM THE PAN AT THE MIC AND FACING -- 
19:58:06 NOW BROUGHT ON IN THE CURRENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.

19:58:08 WHETHER THAT'S HIRING, SOURCING MATERIALS.

19:58:12 WE KNEW THAT THERE WAS GOING TO BE THAT FEEDBACK OUT THERE, BUT WE HAD OTHER 
19:58:17 BUSINESSES, SAY THAT'S NOT A BIG DEAL AT ALL, THAT'S FINE.

19:58:21 SO WE FELT THAT THE FEE AND THE REIMBURSEMENT STRUCK A BALANCE, WHERE 
19:58:25 WE WERE PROVIDING A PATHWAY FOR BUSINESSES WHO FELT IT MIGHT BE MORE 
19:58:30 CHALLENGING TO MOVE FORWARD WITHOUT HAVING THE ADDITIONAL FEE IF THEY 
19:58:34 MOVED FORWARD WITHIN THE NEXT EIGHT MONTHS, BUT THEN ALSO HAVING A FEE 
19:59:21 GOING FORWARD TO ENSURE CONTINUED COST RECOVERY



20:01:33  NOW THAT THINGS ARE MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

20:01:34 THANK YOU.

20:01:42 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

20:01:44 NEXT IS COUNCILMEMBER KENG, CLARIFYING QUESTIONS.

20:01:47 >> Councilmember Keng: YES, SO THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR.

20:01:55 AS A RESTAURANT OWNER ACTUALLY, I DO APPRECIATE THE STAFF WORKING ON THIS 
20:02:00 PROGRAM BECAUSE THE RESTAURANTS ARE AMONG THE HARDEST HIT INDUSTRIES 
20:02:04 DURING THIS PANDEMIC THAT HAS GONE ON FOR OVER TWO YEARS NOW.

20:02:14 IN FREMONT, WE DID PUT IN A COUPLE MEASURES BESIDES THE PATIO PROGRAM.

20:02:19 WE HAD PUT IN A CAP ON DELIVERY PLATFORM FEES AS WELL AS THE FREMONT 
20:02:23 PROGRAM THAT WAS VERY SUCCESS FELL, SO I'M HAPPY TO SEE US WORKING ON 
20:02:28 CONTINUING THIS PATIO PROGRAM, AND I DO HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS.

20:02:40 ONE IS YOU MENTIONED THAT IF  THE -- SO WE CAN APPLY TO BUILD A PATIO ON 
20:02:47 PARKING SPACES AND DO THEY NEED A LANDLORD'S APPROVAL OR IF THE CITY 
20:02:52 WILL WORK WITH THE RESTAURANT TO SEEK THAT APPROVAL, AND WHAT IF IT'S AN  
20:02:59 ON-STREET PARKING, DOES THAT HAVE A DIFFERENT REQUIREMENT OF THE PROCESS 
20:03:00 THAT IT TAKES?

20:03:06 >> YES, SO FOR APPLICATIONS THAT ARE ON PRIVATE PROPERTY, WHICH WOULD BE 
20:03:11 MOSTLY THOSE PATIOS THAT ARE LOCATED WITHIN PARKING SPACES, WE'VE ALSO SEEN 
20:03:15 THEM IN PRIVATELY OWNED PLAZAS, THE BUSINESS WOULD BE REQUIRED TO GET 
20:03:20 THEIR LANDLORD'S APPROVAL, AND WE HAVE WORKED WITH BUSINESSES IN THE PAST TO 
20:03:23 HELP THEM SECURE THAT APPROVAL, WHETHER THAT'S TALKING TO THEIR LANDLORD ABOUT 
20:03:28 WHAT THE PROGRAM IS ABOUT, EXPLAINING WHAT WE ALLOW AND DON'T ALLOW TO GIVE 
20:03:33 THEM A SENSE OF WHAT REGULATIONS THEY MIGHT WANT TO IMPOSE ON THE BUSINESS 
20:03:36 AS WELL OR WHAT WE ALREADY HAVE COVERED.

20:03:42 SO THAT CERTAINLY WILL BE A COMPONENT OF THE PROCESS GOING FORWARD, BOTH IN 
20:03:46 TERMS OF THE REQUIREMENT AND THE FACT THAT WE WILL ASSIST BUSINESSES TO THE 
20:03:50 BEST OF OUR ABILITY WITH OBTAINING THAT APPROVAL FROM THE RELEVANT PARTY.

20:03:55 IN TERMS OF THE PATIOS THAT ARE ON THE SIDEWALK AND ON THE STREET, THOSE ARE 
20:03:59 AREAS IN WHICH OBVIOUSLY THE CITY IS KIND OF THE LANDLORD AND SO WHAT WE 
20:04:04 NEED IN ORDER TO PROVIDE AUTHORITY FOR THE BUSINESS TO USE THAT SPACE IS A 
20:04:08 FEW EXTRA KIND OF DOCUMENTATION ISSUES THAT WOULD BE STUFF LIKE PROOF OF 
20:04:12  INSURANCE, MAKING SURE THE BUSINESS HAS INSURANCE THAT MEET OUR 
20:04:16 REQUIREMENTS AS WELL AS BECAUSE IT IS CITY PROPERTY, WE DON'T ALLOW 
20:04:20 BUSINESSES TO ATTACH OR AFFIX ANYTHING PERMANENT TO THOSE AREAS, SO WE NEED 
20:04:24 THAT ADDITIONAL CERTAINTY OR CERTIFICATION FROM THE BUSINESS THAT 
20:04:27 THEY WILL NOT DO THAT IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF THEIR PATIO.

20:04:33 AND SOL WITH THAT, WE CAN, YOU KNOW, SIGN OVER AUTHORIZATION TO USE THE 
20:04:37 PUBLIC RIGHT-OF-WAY THROUGH THE PERMIT PROCESS.

20:04:42 IT WILL NOT REQUIRE ANY SEPARATE APPROVAL FROM THE CITY LIKE AN 
20:04:44 ENCROACHMENT PERMIT TO USE THE PUBLIC RIGHT-OF-WAY.

20:04:50 IT WOULD CERTAINLY BE HANDLED THROUGH THE OUTDOOR COMMERCIAL PATIO PROCESS 
20:04:50 ONLY.

20:04:51 >> Councilmember Keng: GREAT.

20:04:52 THANK YOU SO MUCH.

20:04:59 SECOND QUESTION IS, SINCE -- I KNOW THAT ONE YEAR GOES BY REALLY QUICK AND 
20:05:05 IT IS VERY HELPFUL TO NOT HAVING TO APPLY EVERY YEAR, BUT THEN DO WE HAVE 
20:05:11 LIKE AN END TIME, BECAUSE IT COULD BE FIVE YEARS, 10 YEARS, THAT COMES UP 
20:05:18 QUICKLY, BUT WE'RE USING SOME OF THESE KIND OF  MAKESHIFT MATERIALS AND THEY 
20:05:23 ARE MAYBE -- YOU KNOW, THEY WEAR OUT DIFFERENTLY THAN PERMANENT STRUCTURES, 
20:05:29 BUT WE ALSO NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT CUSTOMERS ARE SAFE WHEN THEY'RE DINING 
20:05:30 UNDER THOSE PATIOS.

20:05:34 >> DEFINITELY.

20:05:38 SO THE WAY THE PROGRAM IS STRUCTURED, THE PERMIT IS TIED TO THE BUSINESS 
20:05:38 ITSELF.

20:05:43 SO WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT IF THERE IS A CHANGE IN THE OPERATOR OF THE 
20:05:48 BUSINESS, THEN THE PATIO WOULD NEED TO BE REMOVED AND IF THE NEW OWNER OF THE 
20:05:53 BUSINESS OR THE NEW BUSINESS IN THAT SPACE WANTED TO ALSO HAVE A PATIO, 
20:05:55 THEY WOULD HAVE TO REAPPLY THROUGH THE PROGRAM.

20:06:02 SO THE PATIO LENGTH OR LONGEVITY IS REALLY TIED TO THE LONGEVITY OF THAT 
20:06:02 BUSINESS.

20:06:06 TO YOUR POINT, SOME BUSINESSES WE REALLY HOPE ARE LONG TERM BUSINESSES 
20:06:10 IN FREMONT AND THEY STAY AROUND FOR, YOU KNOW, A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME 
20:06:15 WHERE MATERIALS MAY WEAR OUT OR MAY HAVE DEFECTS.

20:06:19 SO THAT'S REALLY ONE OF OUR CONSIDERATIONS BEHIND PUTTING TOGETHER 
20:06:23 THIS BARRIER LIST, IS MAKING SURE WE'RE CHOOSING MATERIALS THAT ARE MORE 
20:06:28 WEATHER PROOF AND WE'VE SEEN THROUGH THE PAST TWO YEARS HAVE JUST HELD UP 
20:06:30 AND LOOKED BETTER AND BEEN SAFER FOR LONGER.

20:06:36 YOU KNOW, WE HAVE THAT EXPERIENCE NOW TO BE ABLE TO KIND OF HAVE AT LEAST A 
20:06:39 SMALL PREVIEW INTO THE ONES THAT JUST ARE VERY TEMPORARY.

20:06:47 BUT THERE MAY COME A TIME WHEN SOME OF THESE PATIOS DO HAVE FAILING 
20:06:49 INFRASTRUCTURE AND THERE IS A PROCESS IN THE ORDINANCE WHERE THE CITY CAN 
20:06:52 PROVIDE NOTICE TO BUSINESSES THAT THEY NEED TO CHANGE THINGS ABOUT THEIR 
20:06:53 PATIO IN ORDER TO KEEP THEM.

20:07:02 AND SO THAT'S THE PROCESS THAT WE'D BE UTILIZING TO KIND OF KEEP THE PATIOS 
20:07:08 LOOKING LIKE NEW LONG TERM, MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE KEEPING THEM SAFE AND 
20:07:10 KEEPING THEM IN COMPLIANCE WITH THEIR CONDITIONS OF APPROVAL THAT THEY'LL 
20:07:11 RECEIVE FROM US.

20:07:17 AND IT'S REALLY ON AN AS-NEEDED BASIS THEN, SO THE PATIOS THAT DO A GREAT 
20:07:20 JOB OF KEEPING THEIR MATERIALS FRESH AND CLEAN WILL BE ABLE TO OPERATE FOR 
20:07:22 AS LONG AS THEY WANT WITH, YOU KNOW, VERY LITTLE CITY INVOLVEMENT.

20:07:27 AND THOSE THAT MAY NEED A  HELPING HAND WILL RECEIVE  NOTICES WHEN WE DO 
20:07:32 NOTICE THAT THEIR BARRIERS MAY BE STARTING TO FAIL OR MAY NEED UPGRADING 
20:07:37 AND WE'LL KEEP THEM IN CHECK THROUGH THAT MECHANISM THAT'S IN THE TEXT OF 
20:07:38 THE ORDINANCE  ITSELF.

20:07:39 >> Councilmember Keng: I SEE, OKAY.

20:07:47 SO WE WILL BE CONDUCTING KIND OF REGULAR REVIEWS OR CHECKUPS ON THESE 
20:07:48 PATIOS?

20:07:52 >> WE DON'T CURRENTLY HAVE ANY PLANS FOR SPECIFIC REVIEWS OF THEM, BUT AS 
20:07:58 WITH MOST CODE ENFORCEMENT IN THE CITY, IT WOULD BE DONE ON A  COMPLAINT-BASED 
20:07:58 BASIS.

20:08:01 SO IF WE DO HAVE OFFICERS WHO ARE OUT, NOTICE THAT THE PATIOS ARE FALLING 
20:08:06 INTO DISREPAIR OR VIOLATING CONDITIONS, AS WITH ANY OTHER CODE ISSUE, THEY 
20:08:09 WOULD REPORT THAT AND WORK WITH US TO RECTIFY IT THROUGH THE PROCESS IN THE 
20:08:10 ORDINANCE.

20:08:13 

20:08:13 >> Councilmember Keng:UNDERSTOO D.

20:08:14 THANK YOU.

20:08:16 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

20:08:21 CLARIFYING QUESTION NEXT IS YANG SHAO.

20:08:24 I THINK WE'RE ROLLING INTO COMMENTS FROM WHAT I'M HEARING.

20:08:27 CLARIFYING QUESTION?

20:08:34 I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY OTHER SPEAKERS TOO.

20:08:37 >> Councilmember Shao: AIL ONLY LIMIT MINE TO CLARIFYING QUESTIONS.

20:08:41 IS THE PERMIT TRANSFERABLE IF THE BUSINESS IS SOLD TO A NEW OWNER?

20:08:48 >> Mayor Mei: MY ABOLINGS.

20:08:51  APOLOGIES.

20:08:53 GO AHEAD, COURTNEY.

20:08:59 >> Councilmember Shao: IS THE PERMIT TRANSFERABLE IF THE BUSINESS IS SOLD 
20:09:01 TO THE NEW OWNER?

20:09:05 >> YES, SO THE PERMIT IS TIED TO THE BUSINESS ITSELF.

20:09:08 SO IT'S NOT TIED TO A PARTICULAR OWNER OF THE BUSINESS.

20:09:13 SO IF, YOU KNOW, A CERTAIN BUSINESS ENTITY IS SOLD FROM ONE TO THE OTHER, 
20:09:18 THAT PERMIT WOULD REMAIN IN EFFECT WITH THE NEW OPERATOR.

20:09:25 WHAT IS NOT COVERED IS IN THE CASE WHERE ONE BUSINESS IS IN A SPACE AND 
20:09:29 IT LEAVES AND ANOTHER BUSINESS, EVEN IF THAT'S A NEW RESTAURANT, LET'S SAY, 
20:09:32 AND THE OLD BUSINESS WAS ALSO A RESTAURANT, THAT COMES IN, IN THAT 
20:09:36 CASE, THE PATIO IS NOT GRANDFATHERED.

20:09:40 BUT IF IT'S THE SAME LEGAL ENTITY THAT'S CONTINUING TO RUN THE PATIO 
20:09:44 JUST A DIFFERENT OWNER UNDER THE LAW, THEN YES, THE PATIO WOULD BE ABLE TO 
20:09:45 CONTINUE IN THAT CASE.

20:09:50 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

20:09:53 CLARIFYING QUESTION, COUNCILMEMBER JONES.

20:09:56 >> Councilmember Jones: THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR.

20:10:02 COURTNEY, JUST TO CLARIFY, WE'RE REIMBURSING EVERY BILLS FOR THE PERMIT 
20:10:06 FEE THROUGH THE END OF THIS YEAR, SO THERE IS ESSENTIALLY A ZERO FEE TO 
20:10:11 APPLY FOR THESE PERMITS AS LONG AS THE FUNDING FROM ECONOMIC  DEVELOPMENT 
20:10:12 REMAINS, IS THAT CORRECT?

20:10:20 I SEE YOU NODDING YOUR HEAD.

20:10:23 GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME.

20:10:25 JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE OF  THAT.

20:10:37 AND --

20:10:37 >> Mayor Mei: OKAY.

20:10:41 I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT'S IT FOR THE CLARIFYING QUESTIONS.

20:10:44 I'M GOING TO TURN TO PUBLIC COMMENT.

20:10:47 I DON'T SEE ANY HERE, BUT I WANTED TO NOTE, THOUGH, THANK YOU FOR THOSE WHO 
20:10:53 HAVE WRITTEN IN SUPPORT AND THAT PEOPLE  HAD -- FOR THIS PROCESS, AND THIS HAS 
20:10:58 BEEN AN ONGOING PROCESS THAT WE ARE LEARNING MUCH LIKE OTHER CITIES, AND 
20:11:04 WE APPRECIATE THE PARTNERSHIP, AND I'VE CERTAINLY SEEN THIS WEEK ALONE, WE HAD 
20:11:11 AN OPPORTUNITY WHERE WE HAD A VISIT FROM OUR CONGRESSMAN WHERE IN 
20:11:20 PARTICULAR VISITING SOME OF OUR SMALL BUSINESSES, HAD SEEN POP-UP PATIOS, 
20:11:26 DURING TIME, WHEN IT WAS NEEDED FROM THE COMMUNITY, NOISE OR DUST, THEY 
20:11:30 ADDED PLEXIGLASS OR AIR CONDITIONER OR HEATER DEPENDING ON THE WEATHER AND 
20:11:32 ELEMENTS THAT WERE THERE.

20:11:36 SO I NOTICED THAT SOME OF THEM HAVE ADOPTED -- ADAPTED OVER THESE TIMES.

20:11:45 SO I DON'T SEE ANY OTHER PUBLIC PART PANTS AND I'LL TURN IT BACK -- I ALSO 
20:11:48 WANTED TO NOTE BEFORE WE MAKE THIS ADOPTION, BECAUSE IT IS SOMETHING MORE 
20:11:54 FORMAL IN TERMS OF ITS ORDINANCE, I KNOW WE HAVE OUR NEW CITY ATTORNEY 
20:11:59 WHO'S WITH US ALSO AND HE WILL HAVE AN ORDINANCE TO READ WITH THAT.

20:12:03 BUT I WANTED TO SEE IF THERE ARE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE 
20:12:05 COUNCIL BEFORE WE GO AHEAD AND MAKE A MOTION.

20:12:07 VICE MAYOR SALWAN.

20:12:11 >> Vice Mayor Salwan: I'D LIKE TO MAKE A MOTION TO ACCEPT STAFF 
20:12:11 RECOMMENDATION.

20:12:14 >> Councilmember Keng: I SECOND THAT.

20:12:17 >> Mayor Mei: COUNCILMEMBER  SHAO, WERE YOU JUST GOING TO SECOND?

20:12:18 I SAW YOUR HAND RAISED.

20:12:21 >> Councilmember Shao: NO, ACTUALLY I HAVE A COMMENT.

20:12:27 I WELCOME COUNCILMEMBER TERESA COX''S SUGGESTION TO ENCOURAGE MORE 
20:12:36 APPLICANTS, BUT IF WE GIVE THEM A $500 DISCOUNT INSTEAD OF A $350 DISCOUNT, 
20:12:42 GUESS WHO, YOU KNOW, WHICH WAY WOULD ENCOURAGE MORE PEOPLE TO APPLY?

20:12:48 OF COURSE THE $500, BECAUSE TO THE CITY, WE'RE JUST GIVING THEM $0 
20:12:50 BASICALLY, YOU KNOW, APPLICATION FEE.

20:12:59 SO IN THIS CASE, I DO NOT SEE THE NEED TO LOWER DOWN THE APPLICATION FEE.

20:13:07 IT JUST A MIND GAME, YOU KNOW, LIKE WE ALLOCATE $40,000 TO REIMBURSE THEM.

20:13:13 WE CAN SAY, OH, IT JUST COSTS YOU 5 CENTS.

20:13:16 $40,000 WILL COVER A LONG WAY, YOU KNOW?

20:13:20 PROBABLY A LOT LIFETIME.

20:13:24 OR WE SAY IT COST YOU, YOU KNOW, $2,000, AND NOW IT'S FREE.

20:13:27 I GUESS, YOU KNOW, IT'S A BALANCE.

20:13:34 RIGHT NOW, THE STAFF'S RECOMMENDATION, I THINK IT'S REASONABLE.

20:13:41 AND BASED ON THE PILOT PROGRAM AND THEIR MARKET STUDY, THEY ALREADY TRIED 
20:13:47 TO INTRODUCE THIS REIMBURSEMENT PROGRAM TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO FINISH THE 
20:13:48 APPLICATION THIS YEAR.

20:13:54 SO I THINK THE OBJECTIVE CAN BE REACHED BY DOING SO.

20:13:58 SO I SUPPORT THE CURRENT RATE OF $500.

20:14:04 >> Councilmember Cox: IS THERE ANY OTHER CONSIDERATION IN TERMS OF YOU 
20:14:08 MAY DO IT THIS WAY BECAUSE THEY HAVE A MIXED APPLES OF THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN 
20:14:16 WITH THE SIDEWALK PROGRAM SWITCHING TO THE NEW PROGRAM, BUT MAYBE STARTING IN 
20:14:20 JANUARY 2023, IS THERE ANY CONSIDERATION OF  LOWERING TO $350?

20:14:30 AND GOING FORWARD, AS BRAND NEW OUTDOOR BUSINESSES THAT WOULD BE CLASSIFIED AS 
20:14:32 A BRAND NEW OUTDOOR PROGRAM?

20:14:35 THAT'S ANOTHER THOUGHT.

20:14:41 >> Mayor Mei: I SEE VICE MAYOR SALWAN'S HAND IS RAISED TOO.

20:14:45 >> Vice Mayor Salwan: JUST TO CLARIFY, I THINK COUNCILMEMBER JONES MENTIONED 
20:14:49 THAT THIS PROGRAM WILL END DECEMBER 2022, IS THAT CORRECT?

20:14:58 

20:14:59 >> Councilmember Cox: THE REIMBURSEMENT.

20:15:02 >> Vice Mayor Salwan: DO WE HAVE ENOUGH BUSINESSES  THAT WILL QUALIFY THAT ARE 
20:15:07 ALREADY IN THE QUEUE OR WILL WE HAVE OPENING FOR NEW BUSINESSES TO ALSO BE 
20:15:10 ABLE TO APPLY, BASED ON YOUR CALCULATIONS?

20:15:15 >> WE ACTUALLY -- THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION, VICE MAYOR  SALWAN.

20:15:20 WE DO ANTICIPATE HAVING ENOUGH OF THE BONUS INCENTIVE MATCHING FUNDS TO 
20:15:25 OFFSET OR I SHOULD SAY REIMBURSE THE $500 PERMIT FEE FOR ANY BUSINESS THAT 
20:15:28 APPLIES THE REMAINDER OF THE CALENDAR YEAR.

20:15:34 AND OUR HOPE IS TO INCENTIVIZE AND REALLY GET THEM TO TAKE ACTION, 
20:15:40 BECAUSE WE DO HAVE A NUMBER OF BUSINESSES THAT ARE OPERATING THESE 
20:15:45 OUTDOOR COMMERCIAL AREAS UNDER THE PILOT PROGRAM, AND WE WANT TO GET THEM 
20:15:48 FULLY LEGALIZED AND HAVE PERMANENT OUTDOOR PATIO SPACES.

20:15:53 AND SO THIS IS THE PLAN, AND WE HOPE THAT THE $500 REIMBURSEMENT WILL 
20:15:57 PROVIDE AN EXTRA IMPETUS FOR THEM TO TAKE ACTION NOW.

20:16:01 >> Vice Mayor Salwan: SO COUNCILMEMBER COX, THAT SOUNDS GOOD TO ME.

20:16:02 WHAT DO YOU THINK?

20:16:07 I MEAN, UNTIL THE END OF THE YEAR -- COX KOCH I HAVE A FEW MORE -- YOU 
20:16:10 KNOW, THAT'S A FEW MORE MONTHS, BUT THERE'S OTHER NEW BUSINESSES AS WE 
20:16:16 WALK THROUGH FREMONT AND WE SEE VACANCIES THAT THOSE ARE OTHER 
20:16:25 OPPORTUNITIES THAT COULD BE CAPTURED IF THEY CAN'T DO IT  NOW, GOING FORWARD 
20:16:28 THERE COULD BE SOME OTHER NEW ONES THAT COULD BE ON BOARD.

20:16:32 >> Mayor Mei: I ALSO WANTED TO NOTE THERE IS A COMMUNITY BLOCK GRANT EVERY 
20:16:36 YEAR SO THIS IS SOMETHING WE'VE STEPPED UP IN THE PAST AND I'M REALLY 
20:16:38 APPRECIATIVE OF THE EFFORTS OF THE COUNCIL AS WELL AS OUR PARTNERSHIP 
20:16:43 FROM OUR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT TEAM WHERE WHEN WE SAW THE IMMEDIATE IMPACT 
20:16:48 OF THE PANDEMIC THAT WE DID UTILIZE SIGNIFICANT FUNDS AND ACTUALLY HAVE 
20:16:50 GIVEN OUT OVER $1 MILLION IN SMALL BUSINESS GRANTS.

20:16:57 SO I FEEL THAT IF IT'S SOMETHING THAT PENDING THE FUTURE NEED, AND I SEE 
20:17:00 CHRISTINA BRIGGS, OUR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DIRECTOR, THAT WE WILL 
20:17:04 STEP UP AND LOOK AT DIFFERENT WAYS, BUT I DO AGREE ALSO IN LISTENING TO THE 
20:17:08 DISCUSSION AND CONVERSATION THAT WHEN IT COMES TO PERMITTING AND REVIEW, 
20:17:12 THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT MAINTAINED WELL, AND THAT 
20:17:16 THERE ARE COSTS FOR THAT FROM THE BUDGET.

20:17:19 SO I CANNOT PREDICT THE FUTURE OF OUR BUDGET AND THE IMPACTS FOR THE 
20:17:22 BUSINESSES, SO I THINK THAT IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD LOVE TO 
20:17:26 INCENTIVIZE FOR IMMEDIATE ACTION TO MAKE IT MORE FIRM AND MAKE SURE THAT 
20:17:30 THEY'RE COMPLIANT IN TERMS OF ADOPTION OF THIS LEGALLY AS THE ORDINANCE WHICH 
20:17:33 IS WHY WE'RE BRINGING IT FORWARD TODAY, AND THEN WE'LL LOOK AS IT MOVES 
20:17:39 FORWARD ALSO AS WE LOOKED AT THE BUDGET AND THE NEEDS AS WE'RE IMPLEMENTING 
20:17:43 THIS AND I THINK WE'RE ALL EVOLVING IN THIS AREA, SO I'M EXCITED THAT WE HAVE 
20:17:47 BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN SECURING ADDITIONAL COMMUNITY BLOCK DEVELOPMENT GRANTS AND 
20:17:52 ALSO THAT WE ARE CONTINUALLY, AS PART OF OUR LONGER TERM, WE HAD A 
20:17:56 SUBSTANTIAL PRESENTATION THAT WAS PROBABLY 75 SLIDE OR SOMETHING ON THE 
20:17:59 SMALL BUSINESS RECOVERY FRAMEWORK, AND IT  TALKED ABOUT ALL THESE DIFFERENT 
20:18:03 AREAS AND SOME OF THIS WAS ENCAPSULATED INTO THAT.

20:18:07 I SEE OUR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DIRECTOR CHRISTINA BRIGGS HAS RAISED HER HAND, 
20:18:10 BUT I DO WANT TO NOTE WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND.

20:18:10 CHRISTINA BRIGGS?

20:18:16 >> JUST VERY QUICKLY, MADAME MAYOR, I JUST WANTED TO ADD TO THE CONVERSATION 
20:18:22 WITH RESPECT TO THE FEE AS COURTNEY HAD MENTIONED, THE PLANNING DEPARTMENT AND 
20:18:27 COMMUNITY  DEVELOPMENT OPERATE IN A  DEVELOPMENT COST CENTER BUSINESS 
20:18:33 MODEL, AND SO MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE ANALYSIS OF THE $500 REALLY DOES 
20:18:35 JUST COVER COST.

20:18:41 IF THE FEE WERE TO BE REDUCED, STAFF WOULD HAVE TO ANALYZE THAT BECAUSE 
20:18:44 THERE IS THE POTENTIAL THAT WE WOULD THEN BE LOSING MONEY AND THAT IS NOT A 
20:18:47 SUSTAINABLE BUSINESS MODEL AT THAT POINT FOR THE PROGRAM.

20:18:50 SO I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE TO ADD THAT INTO THE CONVERSATION.

20:18:51 THANK YOU.

20:18:55 KOCH COX NOW DOES THE GRANT -- WHEN DOES THE GRANT MONEY  EXPIRE?

20:18:58 EVERYTHING EXPIRES WITH GRANTS.

20:19:00 WHAT'S THE END DATE OF THIS GRANT?

20:19:03 NOT THE END OF THE PROGRAM THAT YOU OFFER REIMBURSEMENT.

20:19:08 I'M LOOKING AT GRANTS HAVE END DATES, SO WHAT IS THE END DATE?

20:19:15 >> SO THE $500 PERMIT FEE REIMBURSEMENT WOULD GO THROUGH THE END OF THIS 
20:19:16 CALENDAR YEAR.

20:19:19 SO DECEMBER 31ST, 2022.

20:19:21 >> Councilmember Cox: WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THAT?

20:19:24 YOU HAVE TO REAPPLY FOR THE COMMUNITY BLOCK GRANTS, RIGHT?

20:19:27 ?

20:19:31 >> Ms. Briggs: COUNCILMEMBER, JUST TO BE REALLY CLEAR, THIS IS ONE-TIME 
20:19:34 MONEY WE HAVE STILL AVAILABLE FROM CARES ACT  FUNDING, FEDERAL FUNDING 
20:19:37 THAT WE RECEIVED FOR BUSINESS ASSISTANCE AS A RESULT OF COVID 
20:19:38 IMPACTS.

20:19:41 SO WHEN THAT MONEY IS GONE, IT'S GONE.

20:19:46 THE PROGRAM, THE OUTDOOR DINING PROGRAM WILL BE AN ONGOING PROGRAM THAT 
20:19:51 BUSINESSES CAN APPLY TO PARTICIPATE IN FOR --

20:19:52 >> Councilmember Cox: I UNDERSTAND THAT PART.

20:19:55 IT WAS JUST THE FUNDING PART TIED WITH WHY WE'RE DOING THE REIMBURSEMENT.

20:20:00 WHERE IS THE SOURCE, AND I WORK WITH A LOT OF GRANTS AS WELL, AND JUST WANTED 
20:20:06 TO MAKE SURE I UNDERSTOOD, YOU DEFINED THE SOURCE AND I REMEMBER READING THAT 
20:20:08 IN THE LITERATURE, BUT JUST UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE WAS NO END 
20:20:14 DATE IN OUR READING  MATERIAL, AND WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT WAS CLEAR AND 
20:20:20 WHY WE HAVE JUST THIS FINITE TIME PERIOD UNTIL THE END --

20:20:21 >> Ms. Briggs: RIGHT.

20:20:22 >> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.

20:20:25 >> Mayor Mei: SO I HAVE ALREADY A MOTION AND A SECOND.

20:20:30 BEFORE WE ADOPT IT, I KNOW OUR ATTORNEY IS GOING TO READ THE ORDINANCE.

20:20:33 >> THANK YOU, MAYOR.

20:20:36 I'LL GO AHEAD AND READ THE TITLE INTO THE RECORD.

20:20:41 THIS WILL BE AN ORDINANCE OF THE CITY OF FREMONT AMENDING CHAPTER 12.05, 
20:20:47 CHAPTER 18.25, AND CHAPTER 18.190.

20:20:56 REQUIREMENTS FOR OUTDOOR COMMERCIAL PATIOS ON CITY OWNED AND PRIVATE
