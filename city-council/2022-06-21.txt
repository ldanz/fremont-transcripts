19:21:37 >> THANK YOU, MAYOR, TO ALL THE COUNCILMEMBERS AND VICE MAYOR SALWAN AND COUNCILMEMBERS, I SEE SOME 
19:21:46 FAMILIAR FACES TONIGHT, AND I'LL JUST SAY THANK YOU FOR RECOGNIZING MY SERVICE BUT THERE ARE MANY THAT SERVED 
19:21:54 FROM THE FREMONT COMMUNITY, SO I'D LIKE TO SAY THAT I REPRESENT ALL THOSE THAT HAVE SERVED OUR NATION IN UNIFORM.

19:22:06 I'LL KEEP THIS VERY SHORT, BUT I ASKED SOMEONE MANY YEARS AGO WHETHER I WAS IN WASHINGTON, D.C. WHY THEY HAD 
19:22:07 SERVED FOR SO MANY YEARS.

19:22:13 PUBLIC SERVANTS HAD SERVED OUR COMMUNITY MANY YEARS IN DIFFERENT CAPACITIES.

19:22:22 AND THIS PERSON HAD SERVED A COMBINED PUBLIC SERVICE OF OVER 40 YEARS, AND I'D ASKED HIM, YOU KNOW, WHY HAVE YOU 
19:22:25 SERVED SO LONG AS A PUBLIC SERVANT?

19:22:31 HE PULLED OUT -- IT'S SMALL -- A POCKET SIZED CONSTITUTION.

19:22:34 HE SAID I CAN GIVE YOU SIX REASONS.

19:22:38 I'M USING THESE BECAUSE I'M GETTING OLD.

19:22:43 ESTABLISH JUSTICE, SECOND, ENSURE DOMESTIC TRANQUILITY.

19:22:52 NUMBER THREE, PROVIDE [INAUDIBLE] NUMBER FOUR, PROMOTE THE GENERAL WELFARE, NUMBER FIVE, SECURE THE 
19:23:00 BLESSINGS OF LIBERTY FOR POSTERITY, AND  THEN -- THOSE ARE THE SIX  REASONS.

19:23:10 I THINK WHETHER YOU SERVE, YOU KNOW, LOCALLY AT THE COUNCIL LEVEL OR STATE LEVEL OR AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL, I THINK 
19:23:20 THOSE  ALL -- THANK YOU FOR RECOGNIZING MY SERVICE.

19:23:23 EYE JOINED BY MY MOTHER.

19:23:25 WAVE YOUR HAND, MOM.

19:23:28 AND -- OFF CAMERA TO THE SIDE.

19:23:29 SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

19:23:36 >> Mayor Mei: I JUST WANTED TO ALSO SAY, I SAW YOUR MOTHER IN THE BACKGROUND, AND I LOVE HER STYLISH HAT.

19:23:44 SO I SAW HER THERE AND I WANTED TO THANK YOU NOT JUST FOR YOUR SON'S SERVICE BUT I KNOW YOUR FAMILY HAS HAD 
19:23:51 A LONG LEGACY OF SERVICE, BOTH IN THE MILITARY AND IN THE COMMUNITY, AND EVEN WITH YOUR FATHER BEING TEACHER OF 
19:23:51 THE YEAR.

19:23:59 AND SO I JUST WANTED TO SAY THANK YOU FOR THE CONTRIBUTIONS AND WE REALLY ARE GLAD THAT YOU'RE A MEMBER OF OUR 
19:24:02 COMMUNITY AND WE'RE VERY PROUD TO HAVE SEEN YOUR SERVICE AND CAREER.

19:24:10 SO JUST WANTED TO SAY IT'S OUR PLEASURE THIS EVENING TO JOIN YOU AND TO SHARE YOUR CELEBRATION FOR YOUR RETIREMENT, 
19:24:12 AND I'M SURE THERE WILL BE MORE THINGS THAT YOU'LL BE DOING.

19:24:13 >> ALL RIGHT.

19:24:14 THANKS AGAIN, EVERYONE.

19:24:15 >> THANK YOU.

19:24:20 >> Councilmember Cox: MAYOR MEI, MAY I JUST HAVE A MOMENT OF PRIVILEGE?

19:24:22 I JUST WANTED TO HAVE A SPECIAL SLOWT OUT.

19:24:25  SHOUT OUT.

19:24:28 I SERVED WITH GARRETT FOR OVER 12 YEARS ON THE OHLONE COLLEGE BOARD.

19:24:39 HE WAS OUR BOARD CHAIR AS WELL AS OUR BOARD VICE CHAIR AND ALWAYS HAD EVEN STARTED A BOOK FOR TRUSTEES THAT WERE 
19:24:41 NEW COMING ON TO THE OHLONE BOARD.

19:24:49 BUT THAT'S JUST A DROP IN THE BUCKET OF ALL THE THINGS THAT YOU HAVE DONE, GARRETT, AND YOU'RE JUST AN AMAZING 
19:24:57 PERSON, HARD WORKER, DEDICATED TO THE COMMUNITY, BUT IT REFLECTS BACK ON YOUR PARENTS, BOTH YOUR MOTHER AND 
19:25:01 FATHER, OF BEING SO ACTIVE IN THIS COMMUNITY HERE AND BEYOND.

19:25:10 AND SO I'M JUST -- I JUST WANTED TO SHARE, YOU'RE TOO YOUNG TO RETIRE, BUT CONGRATULATIONS TO YOU AND MARIA AND 
19:25:15 THE WHOLE ENTIRE YEE FAMILY FOR ALL OF THEIR WONDERFUL WORK HERE IN THE COMMUNITY.

19:25:16 GOD BLESS YOU.

19:25:30 LOOKING FORWARD TO HAVING YOU REJOIN OUR COMMUNITY, SO THANK YOU SO MUCH.

19:25:40 WITH THAT, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SERVICE AND I WANTED TO ANNOUNCE THAT THE FOLLOWING STUDENTS, I WANTED TO SHARE 
19:25:45 THE CERTIFICATE OF RECOGNITION FOR OUR YOUTH VOTER MOVEMENT LEADERS.

19:25:52 THIS IS AN EFFORT THAT'S SOMETHING WE'VE BEEN VERY PROUD TO RECOGNIZE FOR SO MANY OF OUR STUDENTS, AND I WANTED 
19:26:01 TO ANNOUNCE THEIR NAMES AND PROTECTING THE EFFORTS OF DEMOCRACY FOR AMERICA BY LEADING THE YOUTH VOTER MOVEMENTS 
19:26:08 IN REGISTRY OVER 1800 FREMONT UNIFIED AND NEW HAVEN UNIFIED STUDENTS TO VOTE.

19:28:21 I THINK ACCEPTING THE CERTIFICATE --

19:28:22 >> Ms. Gauthier: SORRY, MADAME MAYOR.

19:28:30 WE DON'T SEE THE TWO PEOPLE WHO ARE SUPPOSED TO BE THE  ORGANIZERS, HOWEVER AS  ATTENDEES, THERE ARE 
19:28:31 SEVERAL STUDENTS ON.

19:28:33 BUT THEY'RE NOT PANELISTS SO WE CAN'T SEE THEM.

19:28:35 SO I JUST WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW THAT.

19:28:36 >> Mayor Mei: SURE.

19:28:39 I'M TRYING TO SEE -- I SEE SOME OF THE STUDENTS THERE.

19:28:51 SO ORIGINALLY WE ARE HOPING -- I THINK WE SCHEDULED IT EARLIER IN JUNE BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE NIGHT WE SCHEDULED 
19:28:57 IT WAS GOING TO BE THEIR GRADUATION AND SO I THINK THAT THAT'S WHY AT THEIR  REQUEST, IT WAS MOVED TO THIS NIGHT.

19:29:06 BUT PERHAPS THEY WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK UNDER ORAL COMMUNICATIONS BECAUSE THAT'S SOMETHING WE'LL BE HOLDING NEXT 
19:29:17 AFTER THIS  PIECE, AND I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR ABOUT THEIR EXPERIENCES FROM GET OUT TO VOTE AND REGISTERING THEIR 
19:29:18 STUDENTS, FELLOW PEERS.

19:29:26 SO THE CERTIFICATES, I KNOW WILL BE PICKED UP AND THEY WILL BE DISTRIBUTED TO EACH OF THE STUDENTS THROUGH THE 
19:29:34 ORGANIZERS, UTE VOTER MOVEMENT ORGANIZERS, JULIE DUNKLE AND SHAMSA RAFAY.

19:29:34 SO THANK YOU.

19:29:39 NEXT IS PUBLIC COMMUNICATIONS AND ORAL COMMUNICATIONS.

19:29:45 FOR THOSE -- FOR ANY ITEM NOT SCHEDULED ON THIS AGENDA THIS EVENING.

19:29:50 COMMUNICATIONS RECEIVED VIA EMAIL WILL BE PLACED ON FILE AND CONSIDERED PART OF THE PUBLIC RECORD.

19:29:59 MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WISHING TO SPEAK MAY DO SO NOW BY PRESSING STAR NINE IF YOU'RE ON THE PHONE OR RAISE HAND ICON 
19:30:00 IF YOU'RE ON ZOOM.

19:30:05 IF NOT NOTED ON THE ZOOM SCREEN, AGAIN, PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME AND IF SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE ORGANIZATION, PLEASE 
19:30:08 STATE YOUR NAME THE NAME OF THE ORGANIZATION IF YOU'RE REPRESENTING.

19:30:14 SO I THINK WE HAVE A COUPLE PEOPLE THAT ARE SPEAKING.

19:30:19 AND SO I THINK -- 3 MINUTES EACH, THAT'S FINE.

19:30:25 WELCOME, MR. HINDS AND YUVRAJ  WALIA.

19:30:28 WE'LL START.

19:30:30 WELCOME, YURAJ.

19:30:31 >> HELLO.

19:30:38 I'M ONE OF THE STUDENTS THAT WAS REPRESENTING THE YOUTH VOTER MOVEMENT AND LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS FOR THE 
19:30:39 VOTER REGISTRATION DRIVE.

19:30:49 TOGETHER WE REGISTERED AROUND 3,000 STUDENTS AROUND THE BAY AREA, AND IT WAS A GREAT EXPERIENCE WORKING TO 
19:30:52 PROTECT DEMOCRACY AND EDUCATE THE NEXT GENERATION OF YOUNG VOTERS.

19:30:53 THANK YOU TO MAYOR MEI.

19:31:01 I KNOW YOU WERE AT THE MISSION SAN JOSÉ DRIVE, THE ONE I ALSO WORKED AT, FOR SHOWING UP TO DEFEND OUR DEMOCRACY.

19:31:06 ESPECIALLY SINCE THE YOUNG GENERATION IS GOING TO BE VOTING IN THE UPCOMING ELECTION, WE FELT IT WAS REALLY 
19:31:13 IMPORTANT TO TEACH THEM THE PROCESSES IN DOING THAT THROUGH THE PREREGISTRATION PROCESS THAT WE GUIDED 
19:31:13 THEM THROUGH.

19:31:22 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:31:25 NEXT SPEAKER IS JOHN HINDS.

19:31:31 WELCOME, MR. HINDS.

19:31:32 >> HELLO, EVERYONE.

19:31:38 I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE POLICE DEPARTMENT FOR SOME IMPROVEMENTS IN THE INFORMATION THEY'RE PROVIDING IN 
19:31:39 THEIR WEEKLY  BLOTTER REPORTS.

19:31:46 IN RECENT MONTHS, WHEN SUSPECTS OVER 18 ARE ARRESTED, WE GET THEIR AGES, THEIR NAMES AND WHAT TOWNS THEY'RE FROM, 
19:31:48 INCLUDING WHETHER THEY'RE HOMELESS.

19:31:55 SOME SIMPLE MEMBERS IN TABLE FORM WOULD BE EVEN MORE USEFUL BUT JUST READING ANECDOTALLY THROUGH A DOZEN OR SO OF 
19:32:01 THESE WEEKLY REPORTS, YOU CAN SEE SOME CLEAR PATTERNS.

19:32:07 AT LEAST HALF ARE ARRESTED FOR THEFT, BUG LA REOR ROBBERY IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS HAVE BEEN HOMELESS PEOPLE.

19:32:11 THAT'S STRIKING BECAUSE HOMELESS MAKE UP SUCH A SMALL FRACTION OF THE CITY'S POPULATION.

19:32:16 NOT SURPRISING, THOUGH, BECAUSE A LARGE SHARE OF PEOPLE IN THAT HOMELESS CONDITION ARE THERE BECAUSE OF DRUG 
19:32:20 ADDICTION AND THEY ENGAGE IN THESE ECONOMIC CRIMES TO PAY FOR THOSE DRUGS.

19:32:27 AND NOTE THAT WHEN YOU HAVE HIGH CONCENTRATIONS OF DRUG ADDICTS, YOU GET HIGH CONCENTRATIONS ALSO OF 
19:32:32 DEALERS AND -- TO STOLEN GOODS.

19:32:36 PUTTING THESE PEOPLE INTO AN APARTMENT DOESN'T CHANGE ANY OF THESE UNDER D-DAY LYING  PROBLEMS.

19:32:41 HOMELESS HAVE ALSO BEEN  ACCOUNTING FOR A SIMILAR SHARE OF ARRESTS FOR VANDALISM, ARSON AND ASSAULT.

19:32:49 THESE CRIMES DON'T HELP PAY FOR A DRUG HABIT, BUT THEY DO SPEAK TO OTHER BEHAVIORAL PROBLEMS OR MENTAL ILLNESS, 
19:32:52 WHICH ARE ALSO NOT SOLVED BY PUTTING SOMEONE INTO AN APARTMENT.

19:32:58 I KNOW MANY PEOPLE HERE LIKE TO APPROACH THIS WITH A HOUSING FIRST PHILOSOPHY.

19:33:05 PLEASE NOTE THAT THOSE OF US WHO DISAGREE AROUND DOING THAT BECAUSE WE HATE ANYONE, BUT BECAUSE WE HAVE A 
19:33:08 DIFFERENT UNDERSTANDING OF THE PROBLEM YOU'RE TRYING TO SOLVE.

19:33:16 IT'S GOOD THAT THE PD IS GIVING US THIS INFORMATION NOW, SO WE CAN APPROACH THIS ISSUE CALMLY AND THOUGHTFULLY AND 
19:33:22 NOT DEPEND SO MUCH ON HAND WAITING.

19:33:23 THANK YOU.

19:33:25 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:33:27 >> Ms. Gauthier: THAT WAS THE LAST SPEAKER.

19:33:30 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:33:39 SO AT THIS TIME, I WILL CLOSE THE PUBLIC COMMENTS, PUBLIC COMMUNICATIONS, AND I THANK THE 
19:33:41 STUDENTS FOR JOINING US THIS EVENING.

19:33:44 AS WELL AS ALL THE OTHER SPEAKERS.

19:33:52 I THINK NEXT ON THE AGENDA ARE ITEMS WE REMOVED, BEGINNING WITH ITEM 2 --

19:33:53 >> Ms. Gauthier: D, LIKE DAVID.

19:33:55 IT'S KELLY ABREU.

19:33:55 >> Mayor Mei: YES.

19:33:56 WELCOME, MR. ABREU.

19:34:00 >> THANK YOU.

19:34:05 THE CEO OF THIS PR AGENCY WAS INTERVIEWED IN 2017.

19:34:12 HE SAID, QUOTE, I DON'T KNOW WHEN IT HAPPENED BUT COMPANIES NOW HAVE THE ATTITUDE I PAID FOR AN AGENCY TO 
19:34:15 PRODUCE CONTENT SO I GET TO SAY WHATEVER I WANT.

19:34:21 BUT BY TALKING WITH WHAT HAS GONE WRONG, A COMPANY CAN AT LEAST ESTABLISH PUBLIC RECORD AND DEPOSIT 
19:34:24 GOODWILL IN THE KARMA BANK FOR BEING HONEST, TRANSPARENT AND ACCOUNTABLE.

19:34:32 SETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT ON ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL MATTERS REQUIRES A STEADY VOICE AND IS NO TIME 
19:34:32 FOR SPIN.

19:34:39 STILL QUOTING LOU HOFFMAN, IF THERE WAS A COMPANY THAT WAS A CHRONIC POLLUTER AND IT WAS CLEAR TO ME THAT THEY'D 
19:34:49 MADE A DECISION AT THE MANAGEMENT LEVEL THAT IT WAS IN THEIR BEST BUSINESS INTEREST TO KEEP POLLUTING, TAKE THE 
19:34:50 FINES AND PAY THE HITS, I WOULD NOT WORK WITH THEM.

19:34:52 WE HAVE OUR REPUTATION TO THINK ABOUT.

19:34:56 TWO, WE WON'T COMMUNICATE ANYTHING THAT'S NOT TRUE, END OF QUOTE.

19:35:03 THIS COUNCIL SHUT DOWN MISSION PEAK TWO YEARS AGO, AND THEN COVERED IT UP AS A PUBLIC HEALTH MEASURE.

19:35:11 THE HOFFMAN AGENCY IS VERY MUCH NEEDED HERE TODAY, NOW, THIS CONTRACT, FOR ONLY $120,000.

19:35:21 IT CAN HELP YOUR COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE AND YOUR LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS PEOPLE TO COME CLEAN, TO HELP CLEAN UP THE MESS 
19:35:27 OF DISINFORMATION AND DUPLICITY THAT YOU'VE BEEN PEDALING FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS.

19:35:37 THIS COUNCIL NEEDS TO STOP HIDING BEHIND THE LEGAL MUMBO JUMBO, NEEDS KAUFMAN TO COME IN HERE AND START 
19:35:41 DEALING IN TRUTH, IN FACTS, IN REALITY.

19:35:41 THANK YOU.

19:35:46 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:35:50 THERE'S NO OTHER SPEAKER ON THIS ITEM.

19:35:57 I'LL TURN IT BACK TO MY COUNCIL TO SEE IF THEY WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A MOTION.

19:36:00 >> Councilmember Shao: I'D LIKE TO MAKE A MOTION.

19:36:01 >> Councilmember Cox: SECOND.

19:36:03 >> Mayor Mei: COUNCILMEMBER  SHAO, SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER COX.

19:36:08 ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE, FOR ITEM 2D AS IN DOG.

19:36:11 >> Ms. Gauthier: COUNCILMEMBER COX, AYE.

19:36:13 COUNCILMEMBER SHAO, AYE.

19:36:15 COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, AYE.

19:36:18 COUNCILMEMBER JONES, AYE.

19:36:20 COUNCILMEMBER KENG, AYE.

19:36:23 VICE MAYOR SALWAN, AYE.

19:36:24 MAYOR MEI, AYE.

19:36:28 ITEM 2D PASSES UNANIMOUSLY.

19:36:35 NEXT IS ITEM 2I, AND I BELIEVE WE HAVE TWO SPEAKERS, I THINK, ON ITEM 2I.

19:36:47 >> GOPALAKRISHNAN PAD MA AND KELLY ABREU.

19:36:48 >> GOOD EVENING.

19:36:54 I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT THE SO CALLED IMPROVEMENTS FOR MISSION BOULEVARD INTERCHANGE.

19:36:56 I HAVE MULTIPLE ISSUES WITH  THIS.

19:37:00 FIRST YOU HAVE AN ITEM ON THE AGENDA TO APPROVE THE USE OF STATE FUNDS FOR THIS PROJECT.

19:37:05 AT THE SAME TIME, IT DOES NOT HAVE AN ATTACHMENT THAT SHOWS WHAT THE CONCEPT PROJECT PLAN  IS.

19:37:11 WHAT EXACTLY DOES THE TRANSPORTATION DEPARTMENT INTEND TO DO AT THIS INTERSECTION?

19:37:15 THAT DOCUMENT HAS NOT BEEN ATTACHED HERE FOR PEOPLE TO EVEN COMMENT ON IT.

19:37:19 WE HAD TO ACTUALLY GO DIGGING INTO THE TRANSPORTATION DEPARTMENT'S WEBSITE TO FIND THAT.

19:37:26 SECONDLY, THERE IS ALREADY CONDITION ON MISSION BOULEVARD, PARTICULARLY WHEN SCHOOLS ARE IN SESSION, GIVEN HOW MANY 
19:37:28 STUDENTS HAVE TO BE BROUGHT TO SCHOOL.

19:37:36 AND WHEN THERE IS EXISTING CONDITION TO REMOVE THE RIGHT TURN LANES WHICH ARE BEING  CALLED SLIP LANES AND I HAD TO 
19:37:43 EVEN FIGURE OUT WHAT THAT MEANT, AND THEN SAY THAT SOMEHOW THE TRAFFIC IS GOING TO BE IMPROVED BECAUSE AFTER YOU 
19:37:49 PASS THROUGH THE CONDITION OF NOT HAVING A FREE RIGHT LANE, YOU SUDDENLY NOW HAVE THREE LANES ON THE FREEWAY 
19:37:56 RAMP DOES NOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF CONDITION, IT INCREASES THE CONDITION ON MISSION BOULEVARD.

19:38:01 AND ALSO SAFETY OF PEDESTRIANS AS WELL AS BIKERS, AS WELL AS FOR CARS.

19:38:08 AND YOU ALSO ARE TALKING ABOUT ACCIDENTS FOR TRUCKS ON THIS INTERSECTION.

19:38:16 AS A DRIVER OF A CAR, I CAN TELL YOU IT IS NOT EASY TO MAKE A RIGHT TURN AT THE RIGHT ANGLE INTO 11 FEET WIDE LANE 
19:38:19 FOR A  CAR, LET ALONE HOW IT WOULD BE FOR A TRUCK.

19:38:24 SO WHEN YOU DO THAT, YOU'RE GOING TO CAUSE MORE DIFFICULTY FOR THE TRUCK TO MAKE A TURN, NOT LESS.

19:38:33 SO I THINK THIS IS MISGUIDED, THE KINDS OF SOLUTIONS THAT ARE BEING ADOPTED AT THIS INTERSECTION, SO I ASK THE CITY 
19:38:40 COUNCIL TO PAY VERY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE CHANGES THAT ARE PROPOSED AT THIS INTERSECTION, AND PUT A STOP TO ANY 
19:38:49 CHANGES THAT HAVE NOT GROWN TO BE USEFUL IN FREMONT TO REDUCE SPEED OR TO PREVENT PEDESTRIANS DEATHS.

19:38:52 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:38:56 THE NEXT SPEAKER IS KELLY ABREU.

19:38:59 >> THANK YOU.

19:39:10 THIS INTERSECTION IS LOCATED ON THE BOUNDARY LINE BETWEEN TWO OF THE DISTRICTS, I BELIEVE IT'S 4 AND 5.

19:39:19 BUT IT'S RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF A PATHWAY BETWEEN A HIGH SCHOOL AND THE CLOSEST MCDONALD'S.

19:39:23 IN FACT, THE CLOSEST RESTAURANT OF ANY KIND TO THAT HIGH SCHOOL.

19:39:25 SO IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT INTERCHANGE.

19:39:37 IT'S ALSO -- BUT WHEN YOU READ THESE REPORTS, YOU JUST SEE A LOT OF STUFF ABOUT IMPROVING VEHICLE OPERATION, 
19:39:44 SAFETY, ENHANCED TRANSIT, EASING CONGESTION, BICYCLISTS AND PEDESTRIANS, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, KIND OF 
19:39:48 JUST GENERIC STUFF AND THEY CALL IT MODERNIZATION WHICH IS A VERY GENERIC WORD.

19:39:54 YOU COULD MODERNIZE ALMOST ANYTHING AS SOON AS IT GETS A FEW YEARS OLD, IT COULD BE MODERNIZED AGAIN, RIGHT?

19:39:56 ISN'T THAT HOW CAPITAL PROJECTS WORK?

19:40:02 BUT THIS PARTICULAR INTERSECTION HAS ACTUAL REAL PROBLEMS.

19:40:12 LIKE PEOPLE WALKING OR BICYCLING UNDERNEATH THAT OVERPASS, IT'S KIND OF UGLY AND KIND OF UNSAFE THERE.

19:40:18 LIKE WHAT ABOUT ALL THOSE TRUCK CRASHES?

19:40:25 THE TRUCK DRIVERS GOING DOWN THAT 8% GRADE OFF THAT OFF-RAMP SOUTHBOUND HAVE ROLLED OVER AND CRASHED AND 
19:40:35 DESTROYED STREETLIGHTS AND INTERSECTIONS AND FENCES AND HIT CARS AND EVERYTHING ELSE FOR A HALF DOZEN 
19:40:36 TIMES IN THE LAST FEW YEARS.

19:40:40 AND THESE ARE BIG TRUCKS LOADED WITH A LOT OF DIRT.

19:40:51 SO I THINK THESE REPORTS NEED TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE CLEAR AND POINTED ABOUT WHAT ARE YOU DOING AND WHAT ARE 
19:40:56 YOU TRYING TO FIX HERE, AND WHY DOES THIS NEED TO BE CHANGED, AND THERE ARE A LOT OF PROBLEMS HERE, AND WE NEED TO 
19:40:57 BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT THEM.

19:40:58 THANK YOU.

19:41:01 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:41:07 AND I SEE VICE MAYOR SALWAN'S HAND RAISED ON THIS ISSUE TOO.

19:41:08 >> Vice Mayor Salwan: THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR.

19:41:15 I WAS WONDERING IF MR. LARSEN COULD JUST GIVE US A HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW OF THIS PROJECT AND WHAT THE BENEFITS 
19:41:20 WOULD BE ONCE IT'S, I GUESS, YOU KNOW, BUILT.

19:41:23 >> Mr. Larsen: GREAT.

19:41:24 YES, HI, GOOD EVENING,  EVERYBODY.

19:41:26 I'M HANS LARSEN, PUBLIC WORKS DIRECTOR.

19:41:32 MAYOR MEI, MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL, HAPPY TO ANSWER THE QUESTION.

19:41:44 SO WE'RE REALLY EXCITED FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO RECEIVE $7.2 MILLION OF STATE FUNDING TO DO BOTH THE PLANNING, 
19:41:47 ENVIRONMENTAL CLEARANCE AND DESIGN FOR A MODERNIZATION PROJECT.

19:41:53 SO WE'RE REALLY AT KIND OF THE BEGINNING STAGES OF PLANNING IMPROVEMENTS FOR THIS AREA.

19:42:01 THERE IS A PLANNING CONCEPT THAT'S BEEN IDENTIFIED AND APPROVED BY THE STATE, AND GENERALLY IT IDENTIFIES THREE 
19:42:02 THINGS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH.

19:42:11 SO ONE, MOST SIGNIFICANTLY AND WAS JUST POINTED OUT, IS THAT THERE'S A VERY SIGNIFICANT SAFETY ISSUE AT THIS 
19:42:18 INTERCHANGE WHERE TRUCKS ARE COMING DOWN THE SOUTHBOUND OFFRAMP, NOT BEING ABLE TO STOP IN TIME AT THE 
19:42:24 INTERSECTION, AND WE HAVE A VERY SIGNIFICANT HISTORY OF TRUCK OVERTURNINGS.

19:42:29 SO ONE OF THE GOALS OF THE PROJECT IS TO ACTUALLY FLATTEN OUT THE OFF-RAMP SO THAT IT PROVIDES MORE TIME FOR 
19:42:33 TRUCKS TO SLOW DOWN FROM THE STEEP GRADE.

19:42:35 SO THAT'S ONE THING WE'RE TRYING TO DO.

19:42:45 ANOTHER ISSUE IS THAT THIS IS A SOURCE OF SIGNIFICANT TRAFFIC CONGESTION, PRIMARILY BECAUSE THERE'S NOT ENOUGH 
19:42:52 ROOM AT THE EXISTING INTERCHANGE FOR TRAFFIC TO QUEUE UP AT THE RAMP METER AT THE INTERCHANGE.

19:43:03 AND SO TRAFFIC NOW BACKS UP AT THE RAMP METER GOING IN THE NORTHBOUND DIRECTION IN THE PM, AND THERE'S NOT 
19:43:08 ENOUGH ROOM FOR CARS TO WAIT AND TRAFFIC BACKS UP ON TO MISSION BOULEVARD AND CREATES A TRAFFIC 
19:43:09 CONGESTION ISSUE.

19:43:13 SO THAT'S A SECOND ISSUE WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS.

19:43:20 THE THIRD ONE IS MORE ON THE LINES OF CREATING A COMPLETE STREET IN THE CORRIDOR, AND  HAVING THE ABILITY FOR 
19:43:24 PEOPLE TO WALK AND BICYCLE THROUGH THE CORRIDOR, SOMETHING THAT'S LACKING THERE TODAY.

19:43:30 THIS IS A GAILT R. GATEWAY LOCATION BOTH TO MISSION SAN JOSÉ HIGH SCHOOL.

19:43:33 WE HAVE STUDENTS WALKING AND BIKING TO THE CAMPUS THERE.

19:43:42 IT'S ALSO A LOCATION FOR PEOPLE TO USE FROM THE NEARBY NEIGHBORHOOD TO WALK AND BIKE TO THE MISSION SAN JOSÉ 
19:43:42 BUSINESS DISTRICT.

19:43:47 SO WE WANT TO CREATE AN OPTION FOR PEOPLE TO HAVE SAFE TRAVEL, IF THEY CHOOSE TO WALK AND BIKE.

19:43:51 SO THOSE ARE THE MAIN THREE OBJECTIVES OF THE PROJECT.

19:43:58 AGAIN, THE ACTION HERE IS TO RECEIVE FUNDING FROM THE STATE TO DO PLANNING, ENVIRONMENTAL CLEARANCE AND DESIGN.

19:44:08 THERE WILL BE MORE COMMUNITY  OUTREACH OPPORTUNITIES AS THE PROJECT IS FURTHER DEVELOPED, AND WE DO HAVE A 
19:44:16 WEB SITE FOR THIS PROJECT, AND I APOLOGIZE THAT IT WASN'T LINKED DIRECTLY INTO THE REPORT TO ALLOW 
19:44:20 PEOPLE TO HAVE AN EASIER UNDERSTANDING OF THE PROJECT SCOPE.

19:44:21 SO I HOPE THAT ANSWERED THE QUESTION.

19:44:24 I'D BE HAPPY TO ADDRESS ANYTHING FURTHER.

19:44:24 THANK YOU.

19:44:32 >> Vice Mayor Salwan: THANK YOU, MR. LARSEN.

19:44:33 THAT WAS GREAT.

19:44:43 HAVING TO HAVE RIDDEN A BIKE ON MISSION BOULEVARD -- IF THERE'S NO OTHER COMMENTS, I'D LIKE TO BRING THIS 
19:44:43 FORWARD.

19:44:45 I THINK THIS IS A GOOD ASSET FOR THE CITY OF FREMONT.

19:44:46 >> Councilmember Keng: SECOND.

19:44:50 >> Mayor Mei: MOTION BY VICE MAYOR SALWAN AND SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER KENG.

19:44:56 I JUST WANTED TO SAY, I KNOW THAT THERE IS -- THIS IS TO ACCEPT THE FUNDING AND WE WILL BE DOING ADDITIONAL 
19:45:01 STUDIES AND I APPRECIATE THE PUBLIC COMMENT ON THIS, AND THAT WE WOULD LOVE TO HAVE THE PUBLIC INVOLVED IN 
19:45:01 THE PROCESS.

19:45:08 THERE IS A PROJECT FACT SHEET THAT'S OUT THERE ALSO AND I WAS GOING TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT IF WE COULD MAKE SURE 
19:45:09 THAT WE POST THAT FOR THE PUBLIC.

19:45:15 I KNOW DIRECTOR HANS LARSEN, WE SHOULD HAVE THAT POSTED TOO, SO I'D LIKE TO SEE THAT SHARED.

19:45:16 THANK YOU.

19:45:22 SO MOTIONED BY VICE MAYOR SALWAN AND SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER KENG.

19:45:25 THIS IS FOR ITEM 2I AS IN INDIA.

19:45:27 THANK YOU.

19:45:30 CAN I GET A ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE.

19:45:32 >> Ms. Gauthier: COUNCILMEMBER COX, AYE.

19:45:35 COUNCILMEMBER SHAO, AYE.

19:45:37 COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, AYE.

19:45:39 COUNCILMEMBER JONES, AYE.

19:45:41 COUNCILMEMBER KENG, AYE.

19:45:44 VICE MAYOR SALWAN, AYE.

19:45:46 MAYOR MEI, AYE.

19:45:48 SO THE ITEM 2I PASSES UNANIMOUSLY.

19:45:50 THANK YOU.

19:46:00 NEXT ON OUR AGENDA THIS EVENING IS CDBG FUNDING RECOMMENDATIONS.

19:46:01 ITEM 5A.

19:46:09 AND THAT WE HAVE OUR HUMAN SERVICES DIRECTOR, SUZANNE SHENFIL, AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS.

19:46:15 AND THIS IS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2022 AND '23 ACTION PLAN.

19:46:21 ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS?

19:46:23 FROM THE PUBLIC?

19:46:32 I SEE MARIE H, MARIE HUGHES.

19:46:32 WELCOME.

19:46:37 >> THANK YOU, MAYOR MEI.

19:46:44 MY NAME IS MARIE HUGHES, AND I AM A NILES RESIDENT, A MEMBER OF THE FREMONT FOR EVERYONE LEADERSHIP TEAM, 
19:46:46  AND A SAFE PARKING VOLUNTEER.

19:46:52 I AM SPEAKING TODAY IN SUPPORT OF USING COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT BLOCK GRANT FUNDS ON BOTH PROJECT HOMEKEY AND THE 
19:46:53 SAFE PARKING PROGRAM.

19:47:02 PROJECT HOMEKEY GETS UNHOUSED PEOPLE OFF THE STREETS AND INTO PERMANENT HOUSING, WHILE  WRAP-AROUND SERVICES 
19:47:02 HELP KEEP THEM THERE.

19:47:04 THIS IS KNOWN AS A HOUSING FIRST APPROACH.

19:47:12 THIS MODEL HAS TWO DECADES OF RESEARCH BEHIND IT THAT SHOWS THAT IT LEADS TO A QUICKER EXIT FROM HOMELESSNESS AND 
19:47:16 GREATER HOUSING STABILITY OVER TIME, COMPARED TO TREATMENT AS USUAL.

19:47:23 IN PARTICULAR, SEVERAL STUDIES CONDUCTED IN THE UNITED STATES FOUND THAT HOUSING FIRST PARTICIPANTS SPENT 
19:47:25 73% OF THEIR TIME IN STABLE HOUSING.

19:47:31 THIS IS COMPARED TO ONLY 32% OF THOSE WHO ARE RECEIVING TREATMENT AS USUAL.

19:47:37 THE SAFE PARKING PROGRAM  SIMILARLY PROVIDES SUPPORT AND STABILITY TO THOSE LIVING IN THEIR CARS, AND THE 
19:47:43 SERVICES PROVIDED VIA THE PROGRAM HELP PARTICIPANTS MAINTAIN THEIR HYGIENE AND ALSO GET INTO PERMANENT HOUSING.

19:47:46 BOTH OF THESE PROGRAMS BENEFIT EVERYONE.

19:47:53 BOTH THE PARTICIPANTS AND THE SURROUNDING NEIGHBORHOODS, BY GIVING PEOPLE LIVING IN THEIR CARS OR DEALING 
19:47:56 WITH ADDICTION A SAFE PLACE TO LIVE.

19:48:03 THANKS TO CITY STAFF AND THE CITIZENS ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR INCLUDING THESE PROGRAMS IN YOUR PROPOSAL FOR HOW TO 
19:48:04 SPEND THE BLOCK GRANT FUNDS.

19:48:05 THANK YOU.

19:48:08 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:48:12 ARE THERE OTHER SPEAKERS?

19:48:17 AT THIS TIME, I WILL CLOSE PUBLIC COMMENT.

19:48:20 I'LL BRING IT BACK TO THE COUNCIL FOR DISCUSSION.

19:48:26 ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COUNCIL ON THIS AGENDA ITEM?

19:48:45 SEEING NONE, I WANTED TO -- I THINK WE HAVE ALSO SUZANNE SHENFIL, WHO HAS JOINED US THIS EVENING, WHO IS THE 
19:48:46 HUMAN SERVICES DIRECTOR.

19:48:53 I KNOW THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE APPRECIATE IS IMPORTANT TO US IN TERMS OF MAKING SURE IT'S AVAILABLE, AND I 
19:49:00 THINK  THAT -- I APPRECIATE THE STAFF ANALYSIS IN TERMS OF HOW WE DECIDED WHICH ORGANIZATIONS TO SUPPORT AND 
19:49:06 IT'S ALSO ATTACHED IN THE ANNUAL ACTION PLAN, WHICH TALKS ABOUT WHICH AGENCIES WE WILL BE SUPPORTING.

19:49:12 AND I THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE TO NOTE THAT THESE ARE ADDITIONAL FUNDS THAT WE'VE BEEN 
19:49:20 WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH OTHER PARTNER ORGANIZATIONS TO PROVIDE HUMAN SERVICES.

19:49:27 I SAW THERE'S AGENCIES LIKE FORESEE, SAVE AND PROJECT HOMEKEY, AS WELL AS HABITAT FOR HUMANITY THAT WE WANT TO 
19:49:27  SUPPORT.

19:49:30 >> YES, MAYOR.

19:49:39 WE HAVE ALSO HERE TONIGHT ROBERT LOPEZ, OUR CDBG ADMINISTRATOR, SO I JUST WANTED TO INTRODUCE HIM, WHO'S BEEN 
19:49:41 DOING A GREAT JOB OF OVERSEEING THE PROGRAM.

19:49:43 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:49:44 WELCOME, ROBERT.

19:49:53 SO AGAIN, I'M GOING TO GIVE THE COUNCIL ONE LAST CHANCE TO MAKE ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS ON  THE -- SEEING NONE, I 
19:49:57 JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE NEED TO GET YOUR APPROVAL FOR THIS ACTION PLAN.

19:50:02 >> Councilmember Shao: SO MOVED.

19:50:03 >> Councilmember Cox: SECOND.

19:50:05 >> Mayor Mei: MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER SHAO, SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER COX.

19:50:09 AND IF I COULD HAVE A ROLL CALL VOTE ON THIS, PLEASE.

19:50:14 >> Ms. Gauthier: COUNCILMEMBER COX, AYE.

19:50:17 COUNCILMEMBER SHAO, AYE.

19:50:19 COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, AYE.

19:50:21 COUNCILMEMBER JONES, AYE.

19:50:23 COUNCILMEMBER KENG, AYE.

19:50:26 VICE MAYOR SALWAN, AYE.

19:50:28 MAYOR MEI, AYE.

19:50:30 SO THE MOTION PASSES  UNANIMOUSLY.

19:50:40 AND I'M GLAD THAT WE'RE ABLE TO SECURE THESE FUNDS AND THEY'RE A REFLECTION OF OUR COMMUNITY'S CONCERN FOR HUMAN 
19:50:42 SERVICES AND THE SUPPORT IN FUNDING THOSE.

19:50:50 SO I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO BE ABLE TO DELIVER THESE AS WE HEAR ALSO ON THE PROJECT -- HOPEFULLY WE HAVEN'T HEARD 
19:50:53 BACK YET ON PROJECT HOMEKEY BUT WE'RE AWAITING THAT FEEDBACK.

19:50:54 >> THANK YOU.

19:50:54 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:51:02 AND AT THIS TIME, I'LL TURN IT ALSO TO ANY COUNCIL COMMUNICATION FOR ORAL REPORTS ON MEETINGS THAT THEY'VE 
19:51:02 ATTENDED.

19:51:13 FOR ACTC, EAST BAY COMMUNITY ENERGY OR FOR EXAMPLE ABAG, I KNOW THERE WAS A MEETING LAST WEEK TOO.

19:51:20 SO IS THERE ANY REPORT OUT FROM ANY OF THESE?

19:51:26 SEEING NONE, I WANTED TO MENTION THAT TONIGHT, WE HAD THE CHANCE WITH BANTER BOOK STORE WHICH WE HAD THEIR GRAND 
19:51:36 OPENING HERE JUST DOWN THE STREET, AND ALSO WE'RE LOOKING VERY MUCH FORWARD TO, IF YOU HAVE TIME TO JOIN US FOR 
19:51:42 OUR STATE OF THE CITY ADDRESS, WHICH WILL BE THIS THURSDAY MORNING IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE FREMONT CHAMBER 
19:51:42 OF COMMERCE.

19:51:48 IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO GIVE AN UPDATE ON SOME OF THE MANY EFFORTS THAT HAVE BEEN HAPPENING THROUGHOUT 
19:51:54 OUR CITY, AND THE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES THAT WE'VE MOVED FORWARD FROM OUR CITY COUNCIL RETREAT, AND LOOK FORWARD TO 
19:52:02 ALL OF YOU BEING ABLE TO JOIN US EITHER IN PERSON OR ELSE THOSE WILL ALSO BE CAPTURED ALONG WITH THE RESOURCES TO

19:52:20 DID YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO ADD IN TERMS OF UPCOMING EVENTS?

19:52:27 >> Councilmember Cox: I DID WANT TO MENTION ONE THING.

19:52:34 I'M VERY PROUD OF OUR LOCAL GOLDEN STATE WARRIORS FOR  WINNING THE CHAMPIONSHIP IN REPRESENTING ALL OF US.

19:52:44 I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT WHEN THAT ALL OF US BRINGS OUR COMMUNITY EVEN CLOSER TOGETHER AND SOME NEW EXCITEMENT TO 
19:52:53 ADD SOME JOY AND SPORTSMANSHIP FOR OUR TEAM BUT I JUST WANTED TO MENTION THAT.

19:52:59 AT OUR NEXT MEETING, I WILL HAVE A REPORT OUT FROM THE EAST BAY COMMUNITY BOARD OF DIRECTORS MEETING.

19:52:59 THANK YOU.

19:53:02 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
