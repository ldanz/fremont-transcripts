A GOVERNMENT THAT CLAIMS TO BE 

[Captioner] 19:13:16
FOR THE PEOPLE, BY THE PEOPLE, 

[Captioner] 19:13:17
SHOULD REPRESENT THE PEOPLE.

[Captioner] 19:13:19
SINCE OCTOBER 7TH, THOUSANDS OF 

[Captioner] 19:13:22
PALESTINIANS HAVE BEEN KILLED.

[Captioner] 19:13:23
THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION 

[Captioner] 19:13:25
AND THE UNITED NATIONS HAVE 

[Captioner] 19:13:26
DEEMED THE REGION AS A 

[Captioner] 19:13:26
CATASTROPHE.

[Captioner] 19:13:28
OVER 1 MILLION HAVE BEEN 

[Captioner] 19:13:30
DISPLACE ANDED AND THE NUMBERS 

[Captioner] 19:13:30
ARE ONLY RISING.

[Captioner] 19:13:32
WE DEMAND YOU RECOGNIZE THE 

[Captioner] 19:13:36
RELEASE OF ALL HOSTAGES, 

[Captioner] 19:13:38
UNRESTRICTED HUMANITARIAN 

[Captioner] 19:13:38
ASSISTANCE.

[Captioner] 19:13:41
ONE MESSAGE I WANT TO GET ACROSS 

[Captioner] 19:13:42
FROM YOU IS THAT A CALL FOR 

[Captioner] 19:13:43
CEASE FIRE WILL STOP DEATH ON 

[Captioner] 19:13:45
BOTH SIDES OF THIS WAR, THE 

[Captioner] 19:13:46
QUESTION IS WHAT SIDE OF HISTORY 

[Captioner] 19:13:46
DO YOU WANT TO BE ON?

[Captioner] 19:13:48
IT IS TIME FOR FREMONT CITY 

[Captioner] 19:13:49
COUNCIL TO CALL FOR IMMEDIATE 

[Captioner] 19:13:49
CEASE FIRE.

[Captioner] 19:13:49
THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 19:14:01
>> I COME TO THE CITY COUNCIL 

[Captioner] 19:14:06
NOW TO REQUEST A RESOLUTION FOR 

[Captioner] 19:14:06
CEASE-FIRE.

[Captioner] 19:14:12
 -- OF A 7 # A-YEAR-LONG 

[Captioner] 19:14:12
GENOCIDE.

[Captioner] 19:14:14
136 DAYS SINCE ALL MASKS WERE 

[Captioner] 19:14:15
TAKEN OFF, EXCUSES WERE PUT TO 

[Captioner] 19:14:16
THE SIDE AND WE CAN SEE THE REAL 

[Captioner] 19:14:17
FACE OF THE WAR MACHINE POWER 

[Captioner] 19:14:18
THAT IS ISRAEL.

[Captioner] 19:14:20
AS MEMBERS OF A COMMUNITY FILLED 

[Captioner] 19:14:21
WITH ONE OF THE MOST DIVERSE 

[Captioner] 19:14:23
POPULATIONS IN THE BAY AREA, IT 

[Captioner] 19:14:25
IS ABSOLUTELY YOUR OBLIGATION TO 

[Captioner] 19:14:26
COME FORWARD AND TAKE A STANCE 

[Captioner] 19:14:27
ON THIS GENOCIDE.

[Captioner] 19:14:29
I REPEAT, GENOCIDE, NOT A 

[Captioner] 19:14:32
CONFLICT, NOT A WAR, BUT THE 

[Captioner] 19:14:33
INDISCRIMINATE ETHNIC CLEANSING 

[Captioner] 19:14:33
OF A RACE.

[Captioner] 19:14:35
IF ANY OF YOU STILL HAVE THE 

[Captioner] 19:14:36
BELIEF THAT THIS IS ANYTHING BUT 

[Captioner] 19:14:39
A GENOCIDE, I ASK YOU TO LOOK AT 

[Captioner] 19:14:41
THE LARGEST POPULATION OF 

[Captioner] 19:14:43
REFUGEES, BOMBED THE SAME NIGHT 

[Captioner] 19:14:43
AS THE SUPER BOWL.

[Captioner] 19:14:46
WHILE AMERICA WAS PREOCCUPIED, 

[Captioner] 19:14:47
PEOPLE WERE BEING SLAUGHTERED.

[Captioner] 19:14:50
AGAIN, I ASK THE CITY COUNCIL TO 

[Captioner] 19:14:52
PASS AN IMMEDIATE CEASE FIRE 

[Captioner] 19:14:52
RESOLUTION.

[Captioner] 19:14:53
NEUTRALITY IS NO LONGER AN 

[Captioner] 19:14:53
OPTION.

[Captioner] 19:14:58
COMPLACENCY IS COMPLIANCEY.

[Captioner] 19:15:00
THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 19:15:04
>> Ms. Gauthier: AFTER MOHAMMAD 

[Captioner] 19:15:05
IS SOPHIA.

[Captioner] 19:15:08
>> COUNCIL MEMBERS I'M HERE TO 

[Captioner] 19:15:10
URGE TO YOU CALL FOR AN 

[Captioner] 19:15:11
IMMEDIATE CEASE FIRE.

[Captioner] 19:15:13
ON OCTOBER 13TH THE ISRAELI 

[Captioner] 19:15:14
GOVERNMENT CUT OFF ALL FOOD, 

[Captioner] 19:15:16
WATER AND ELECTRICITY SUPPLIES.

[Captioner] 19:15:18
IT IS ESTIMATED THAT OVER 1 

[Captioner] 19:15:19
MILLION PEOPLE HAVE BEEN 

[Captioner] 19:15:20
DISPLACED AND OVER 20,000 HAVE 

[Captioner] 19:15:20
BEEN KILLED.

[Captioner] 19:15:21
THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION 

[Captioner] 19:15:22
AND THE UNITED NATIONS HAVE 

[Captioner] 19:15:24
CALLED IT A CATASTROPHE.

[Captioner] 19:15:27
JUST A FEW DAYS AGO ISRAEL 

[Captioner] 19:15:28
BOMBED THE ONLY WORKING HOSPITAL 

[Captioner] 19:15:29
IN THE REGION.

[Captioner] 19:15:30
AFTER ALL THE OTHERS WERE 

[Captioner] 19:15:31
DECIMATED BY ISRAELI BOMBS.

[Captioner] 19:15:34
AT LEAST 190 PEOPLE WERE KILLED 

[Captioner] 19:15:36
AND 340 WOUNDED BY ISRAEL OVER 

[Captioner] 19:15:37
THE LAST 48 HOURS.

[Captioner] 19:15:40
THE NUMBER IS ONLY RISING.

[Captioner] 19:15:42
ISRAELI FORCES TARGET THE MOST 

[Captioner] 19:15:43
VULNERABLE PLACES LIKE HOSPITALS 

[Captioner] 19:15:45
AND AMBULANCES AND SCHOOLS WHERE 

[Captioner] 19:15:46
THOUSANDS OF CIVILIANS ARE 

[Captioner] 19:15:46
SHELTERING.

[Captioner] 19:15:47
WE ARE CALLING FOR A CEASE FIRE 

[Captioner] 19:15:48
ON THE COUNCIL TO PUT PRESSURE 

[Captioner] 19:15:50
ON THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WHO 

[Captioner] 19:15:53
HAS GIVEN OVER $317 BILLION TO 

[Captioner] 19:15:55
ISRAEL SINCE THEIR OCCUPATION OF 

[Captioner] 19:15:55
PALESTINE.

[Captioner] 19:15:56
CALLING FOR A CEASE FIRE MEANS 

[Captioner] 19:15:58
IT WOULD BE THE END OF THIS WAR 

[Captioner] 19:16:01
THAT HAS CREATED CASUALTIES FOR 

[Captioner] 19:16:02
AN ENTIRE POPULATION WHO IS 

[Captioner] 19:16:03
BEING ETHNICALLY CLEANSED AS WE 

[Captioner] 19:16:05
SPEAK AND THE BLOOD IS ON YOUR 

[Captioner] 19:16:05
HANDS FOR BEING SILENT.

[Captioner] 19:16:06
THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 19:16:17
>> QOWN MEMO I URGE US TO 

[Captioner] 19:16:19
REFLECT ON THE URGENT NEED FOR A 

[Captioner] 19:16:20
CEASE-FIRE IN PALESTINE.

[Captioner] 19:16:23
THE ATROCITIES INCLUDING THE 

[Captioner] 19:16:24
BOMBING OF HOSPITALS ARE NOT 

[Captioner] 19:16:26
JUST VIOLATIONS OF INTERNATIONAL 

[Captioner] 19:16:28
LAW BUT ACTS OF PROFOUND 

[Captioner] 19:16:28
INHUMANITY.

[Captioner] 19:16:30
THESE ACTIONS CONSTITUTE CLEAR 

[Captioner] 19:16:32
WAR CRIMES THAT CANNOT BE 

[Captioner] 19:16:34
JUSTIFIED UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE.

[Captioner] 19:16:36
AS CITIZENS OF NATIONS THAT HAVE 

[Captioner] 19:16:38
INFLUENCE IN GLOBAL AFFAIRS, WE 

[Captioner] 19:16:39
MUST ACKNOWLEDGE OUR 

[Captioner] 19:16:39
RESPONSIBILITY.

[Captioner] 19:16:42
WE HAVE CHOSEN THE PEOPLE IN 

[Captioner] 19:16:43
POWER THAT ARE SITTING HERE 

[Captioner] 19:16:45
TODAY, AND THEY HAVE A DUTY TO 

[Captioner] 19:16:45
PROTECT HUMAN RIGHTS.

[Captioner] 19:16:47
IT IS TIME FOR THEM TO FULFILL 

[Captioner] 19:16:49
THIS DUTY BY CALLING FOR AN 

[Captioner] 19:16:49
IMMEDIATE CEASE FIRE.

[Captioner] 19:16:51
THE ONGOING VIOLENCE IN 

[Captioner] 19:16:53
PALESTINE HAS RESULTED IN 

[Captioner] 19:16:54
COUNTLESS CIVILIAN CASUALTIES 

[Captioner] 19:16:55
INCLUDING WOMEN, CHILDREN AND 

[Captioner] 19:16:56
THE ELDERLY.

[Captioner] 19:16:58
FAMILIES HAVE BEEN TORN APART, 

[Captioner] 19:16:59
HOMES DESTROYED AND LIVES 

[Captioner] 19:16:59
SHATTERED.

[Captioner] 19:17:01
WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO TURN A 

[Captioner] 19:17:02
BLIND EYE TO SUCH SUFFERING.

[Captioner] 19:17:04
LET US STAND TOGETHER IN 

[Captioner] 19:17:05
SOLIDARITY WITH THE PEOPLE OF 

[Captioner] 19:17:06
PALESTINE AND DEMAND AN END TO 

[Captioner] 19:17:06
THE VIOLENCE.

[Captioner] 19:17:08
LET US CALL UPON OUR LEADERS TO 

[Captioner] 19:17:10
UPHOLD THE PRINCIPLES OF 

[Captioner] 19:17:12
JUSTICE, DIGNITY AND PEACE AND 

[Captioner] 19:17:12
SEE A FREE PALESTINE.

[Captioner] 19:17:13
THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 19:17:21
>> RESPECTED COUNCIL MEMBERS AND 

[Captioner] 19:17:22

[Captioner] 19:20:06
POLITICS, ESPECIALLY ISRAEL.

[Captioner] 19:20:07
TAKING AN INTERNATIONAL 

[Captioner] 19:20:09
POLITICAL STAND IS DIVISIVE AND 

[Captioner] 19:20:11
LOWERS FREMONT TO THE LEVEL OF 

[Captioner] 19:20:12
POLITICAL BICKERING THAT IS JUST 

[Captioner] 19:20:13

[Captioner] 19:21:21
I HAVE BEEN A RESIDENT OF 

[Captioner] 19:21:22
FREMONT FOR MORE THAN 35 YEARS.

[Captioner] 19:21:25
AS A RESIDENT OF FREMONT, I WANT 

[Captioner] 19:21:27
TO THANK THE COUNCIL FOR NOT 

[Captioner] 19:21:30
BRINGING UP A DIVISIVE AND 

[Captioner] 19:21:31
MISGUIDED CEASE FIRE RESOLUTION 

[Captioner] 19:21:32
TO OUR CITY.

[Captioner] 19:21:34
LET'S REMEMBER THAT HAMAS CAN 

[Captioner] 19:21:36
BRING ABOUT A PERMANENT CEASE 

[Captioner] 19:21:37
FIRE TOMORROW.

[Captioner] 19:21:38
THAT WOULD REQUIRE THEM TO 

[Captioner] 19:21:43
RELEASE THE HOSTAGES AND TO

[Captioner] 19:21:46
 DISARM AND GIVE UP THEIR RULE 

[Captioner] 19:21:46
OVER THE PEOPLE OF GAZA.

[Captioner] 19:21:49
THOSE WHO DEMAND THAT YOU PASS 

[Captioner] 19:21:52
THIS CEASE FIRE IS COMPLETELY 

[Captioner] 19:21:54

RESPONSIBLE FOR CIVILIAN AND

KIDS DYING, ISRAEL IS FIGHTING 

[Captioner] 19:21:59
HAMAS FOR ALL OF US.

[Captioner] 19:22:01
AT THE END I WOULD LIKE TO RAISE 

[Captioner] 19:22:03
THE QUESTION WHETHER IT IS 

[Captioner] 19:22:05
APPROPRIATE TO TAKE UP THE CITY 

[Captioner] 19:22:06

SO YES, IT'S A CLASSIC GENOCIDE 

[Captioner] 19:22:51
ACCORDING TO DEFINITION OF U.N.

GENOCIDE MEANS MOVING AND

CITIES OF SANTA CLARA AND SAN 

[Captioner] 19:23:55
FRANCISCO AND CALL FOR A CEASE 

[Captioner] 19:23:55
FIRE?

[Captioner] 19:23:57
AND I WANT TO TELL YOU IN NO 

[Captioner] 19:23:59
UNCERTAIN TERMS, THAT THE 

[Captioner] 19:24:00
COMMUNITY OF FREMONT, THE 

[Captioner] 19:24:02
CITIZENS OF FREMONT ARE GOING TO 

[Captioner] 19:24:05
HOLD YOU RESPONSIBLE AND 

[Captioner] 19:24:06
ACCOUNTABLE FOR ALL YOUR 

[Captioner] 19:24:06
ACTIONS.

[Captioner] 19:24:09
AND IN THIS CASE, YOUR 

[Captioner] 19:24:09
INACTION.

[Captioner] 19:24:11
I WANT TO URGE YOU THAT YOU CALL 

[Captioner] 19:24:13
FOR A CEASE FIRE IMMEDIATELY.

[Captioner] 19:24:14
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

[Captioner] 19:24:14
[APPLAUSE]

[Captioner] 19:24:29
>> HI.

[Captioner] 19:24:32
I'M LEE, I MOVED HERE IN 1998.

[Captioner] 19:24:35
I'M A DAUGHTER AND GRANDDAUGHTER 

[Captioner] 19:24:37
AND WIFE OF IMMIGRANTS.

[Captioner] 19:24:41
WHEN I VOTED FOR YOU, I ELECTED 

[Captioner] 19:24:44
YOU BASED ON LOCAL PROMISES AND 

[Captioner] 19:24:44
LOCAL PLANS.

[Captioner] 19:24:46
THAT IS WHAT A FREMONT CITY 

[Captioner] 19:24:47
COUNCIL IS.

[Captioner] 19:24:50
NO ONE HERE ELECTED YOU AND 

[Captioner] 19:24:52
ASKED WHAT YOUR VIEWPOINTS WERE 

[Captioner] 19:24:54
ON ANY INTERNATIONAL EVENTS.

[Captioner] 19:24:57
I ASK THAT YOU FOCUS ON THE MANY 

[Captioner] 19:24:59
NEEDS HERE IN FREMONT, AND FOCUS 

[Captioner] 19:25:04
ON KEEPING US TOGETHER AS

[Captioner] 19:25:09
 A UNIFIED GROUP VERSUS

[Captioner] 19:25:12
 PICKING OR CHOOSING DIFFERENT 

[Captioner] 19:25:13
INTERNATIONAL EVENTS THAT YOU 

[Captioner] 19:25:14
WILL SUPPORT OR NOT SUPPORT.

[Captioner] 19:25:17
IT IS NOT WHY THE PEOPLE OF 

[Captioner] 19:25:17
FREMONT ELECTED YOU.

[Captioner] 19:25:20
NOR IS IT WHAT'S GOING TO BE THE 

[Captioner] 19:25:20
NEXT ELECTION.

[Captioner] 19:25:22
IF THAT IS WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO 

[Captioner] 19:25:23
RUN ON, THEN THAT SHOULD BE THE 

[Captioner] 19:25:25
POLITICS THAT YOU'RE TALKING 

[Captioner] 19:25:26
ABOUT, AND THAT'S NOT WHAT 

[Captioner] 19:25:27
ANYONE HERE TALKED ABOUT.

[Captioner] 19:25:31
SO I HOPE THAT YOU WILL STAY 

[Captioner] 19:25:34
STRONG, AND NOT BE FEARFUL OF 

[Captioner] 19:25:36
THREATS, BECAUSE YOU'RE DOING A 

[Captioner] 19:25:37
GREAT JOB AS A CITY COUNCIL.

[Captioner] 19:25:38
>> Ms. Gauthier: THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 19:25:49
>> Ms. Gauthier: MR. DORNEFEST?

[Captioner] 19:25:51
>> AS A FREMONT OF 35 YEARS, I 

[Captioner] 19:25:55
STRONGLY OPPOSE DIVISIVE 

[Captioner] 19:25:57
RESOLUTIONS THAT WOULD DIVIDE 

[Captioner] 19:26:00
OUR COMMUNITY OR IN ANY WAY 

[Captioner] 19:26:03
JEOPARDIZE A WELCOMING, SAFE 

[Captioner] 19:26:06
COMMUNITY SPACE FOR PEOPLE TO DO 

[Captioner] 19:26:07
BUSINESS AND RAISE THEIR 

[Captioner] 19:26:11
FAMILIES, GO TO SCHOOL, BUT IN 

[Captioner] 19:26:14
COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE PASSED 

[Captioner] 19:26:14
RESOLUTIONS, OTHER CITIES IN THE 

[Captioner] 19:26:18
BAY AREA, THERE'S BEEN A RISE IN 

[Captioner] 19:26:19
ANTISEMITISM AND DIVISION.

[Captioner] 19:26:23
I BELIEVE THE GAZA WAR STARTED 

[Captioner] 19:26:24
OCTOBER 7TH IN PARTICULAR, BUT 

[Captioner] 19:26:26
IT'S NOT THE FIRST ONE, AS MANY 

[Captioner] 19:26:28
PEOPLE POINT OUT, THERE'S A LOT 

[Captioner] 19:26:29
OF HISTORY.

[Captioner] 19:26:30
IT'S VERY TRAGIC.

[Captioner] 19:26:32
I KNOW SOMEONE PERSONALLY WHO 

[Captioner] 19:26:36
CLAIMS TO HAVE LOST 10 FAMILY 

[Captioner] 19:26:36
MEMBERS.

[Captioner] 19:26:40
I PERSONALLY HAVE BEEN ASSAULTED.

[Captioner] 19:26:43
AND I WOULD URGE YOU, SIMPLY NOT 

[Captioner] 19:26:46
TO GET INVOLVED IN INTERNATIONAL 

[Captioner] 19:26:47
DISPUTES THAT ARE VERY 

[Captioner] 19:26:47
DIVISIVE.

[Captioner] 19:26:48
>> Ms. Gauthier: THANK YOU.

AS YOU'VE HEARD, TODAY MARKS 136 

[Captioner] 19:27:26
DAYS OF OVER 29,000 PEOPLE 

[Captioner] 19:27:27
KILLED INNOCENTLY.

[Captioner] 19:27:30
THAT'S ABOUT 213 PEOPLE DYING 

[Captioner] 19:27:30
EACH DAY.

[Captioner] 19:27:34
WE'RE GOING THROUGH A VERY 

[Captioner] 19:27:36
UNPRECEDENTED TIME AND 

[Captioner] 19:27:36
CHALLENGING AND TRAGIC TIMES.

[Captioner] 19:27:39
I ACKNOWLEDGE THE CITY COUNCIL 

[Captioner] 19:27:42
DOES NOT INVOLVE, ENGAGE IN 

[Captioner] 19:27:43
INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS AND 

[Captioner] 19:27:43
FOREIGN POLICY.

[Captioner] 19:27:47
BUT I DO BELIEVE AS ELECTED 

[Captioner] 19:27:48
OFFICIALS, BY THE PEOPLE, FOR 

[Captioner] 19:27:52
THE PEOPLE, AND PLEDGE OF 

[Captioner] 19:27:53

FEW MINUTES AGO, THAT CALLS FOR 

[Captioner] 19:27:58
AMERICAN STANCE FOR PEACE, 

[Captioner] 19:28:00
LIBERTY, AND JUSTICE FOR ALL.

[Captioner] 19:28:04
LET IT NOT BE HERE IN 

[Captioner] 19:28:04
CALIFORNIA, IN FREMONT, BUT 

[Captioner] 19:28:06
THAT'S WHERE WE CARRY ALL OVER 

[Captioner] 19:28:07

THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY MUST

CONDEMN THE ATROCITIES, 

[Captioner] 19:28:36
REMAINING SILENT IS NOT AN 

[Captioner] 19:28:36
OPTION.

[Captioner] 19:28:40
WE MUST RAISE OUR VOICES AND 

[Captioner] 19:28:40

ACT URGENTLY TO END THE VIOLENCE 

[Captioner] 19:29:20
AND SUFFERING.

[Captioner] 19:29:23
IMAGINE THE PAIN AND SUFFERING 

[Captioner] 19:29:24
IN PALESTINE.

[Captioner] 19:29:26
INNOCENT LIVES ARE BEING 

[Captioner] 19:29:27
DESTROYED EVERY DAY.

[Captioner] 19:29:29
WE CAN'T IGNORE THE CRIES FOR 

[Captioner] 19:29:30
ANY LONGER.

[Captioner] 19:29:32
EVERY PALESTINIAN DESERVES TO 

[Captioner] 19:29:33

[Captioner] 19:29:33
OPPRESSION.

[Captioner] 19:29:35
LET'S JOIN HANDS AND STAND UP 

[Captioner] 19:29:36
AGAINST THE INJUSTICE.

[Captioner] 19:29:39
PALESTINIAN LIVES MATTER AND 

[Captioner] 19:29:40
PERPETRATORS MUST BE HELD

STOP THE GENOCIDE IN PALESTINIAN 

[Captioner] 19:29:45

[Captioner] 19:29:49

[Captioner] 19:30:05
BY SAMAR FOLLOWED BY HANNAI AND 

[Captioner] 19:30:05
SALIM.

[Captioner] 19:30:12
>> YES, DEAR COUNCIL MEMBERS, MY 

[Captioner] 19:30:14
FATHER WAS ONE OF THE REFUGEES 

[Captioner] 19:30:16
THAT WAS FORCED TO LEAVE WHAT 

[Captioner] 19:30:17
WAS CALLED PALESTINIAN IN 1948.

[Captioner] 19:30:20
THE COLONIAL PROJECT COULD NOT 

[Captioner] 19:30:22
BE ACHIEVED WITHOUT A FORCE.

[Captioner] 19:30:25
THAT WAS THE OBJECTIVE SINCE 

[Captioner] 19:30:25
INCEPTION.

[Captioner] 19:30:28
WHAT YOU SEE NOW IS A COLLECTION 

[Captioner] 19:30:31
OF AN OPPRESSIVE REGIME THAT 

[Captioner] 19:30:32
USES -- IN BOTH WEST BANKS AND 

[Captioner] 19:30:32
GAZA.

[Captioner] 19:30:34
IT DID NOT START ON OCTOBER 7.

[Captioner] 19:30:37
SINCE 1948, THEY MOVED IN AND 

[Captioner] 19:30:38
PUSHED THE NATIVES OUT OF THEIR 

[Captioner] 19:30:38
HOMES.

[Captioner] 19:30:40
WHAT I WANT TO SAY NOW IS LIKE, 

[Captioner] 19:30:43
YEAH, IT'S NOT THE WAR WITH 

[Captioner] 19:30:45
HAMAS THAT KILLED OVER 23,000 

[Captioner] 19:30:47
PEOPLE, 70% ARE WOMEN AND 

[Captioner] 19:30:47
CHILDREN.

[Captioner] 19:30:50
THERE ARE 85% OF TOTAL 

[Captioner] 19:30:51
POPULATION THAT HAVE BEEN 

[Captioner] 19:30:52
DISPLACED AND 90% OF THE 

[Captioner] 19:30:53
POPULATION ARE FACING HUNGER.

[Captioner] 19:30:56
SO IT'S LIKE 1 IN 6 CHILDREN 

[Captioner] 19:30:56
MALNUTRITION.

[Captioner] 19:30:59
SO WHAT WE NEED NOW IS TO LOOK 

[Captioner] 19:31:03
FOR A CEASE FIRE JUST FOR ALL 

[Captioner] 19:31:05
THE SHOW OF HUMANITY AND PEOPLE 

[Captioner] 19:31:05
THAT WE REALLY CARE.

[Captioner] 19:31:06
THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 19:31:14
>> GOOD EVENING.

[Captioner] 19:31:16
MY NAME IS SUMMER.

[Captioner] 19:31:19
I WAS BORN AND RAISED HERE IN 

[Captioner] 19:31:19
FREMONT, CALIFORNIA.

[Captioner] 19:31:23
I WANTED TO SAY THAT AND ASK THE 

[Captioner] 19:31:24
COUNCILMEMBERS TO CALL FOR A 

[Captioner] 19:31:25
CEASE FIRE RESOLUTION.

[Captioner] 19:31:27
IN FACT, IT IS NOT COMPLETELY 

[Captioner] 19:31:29
DIVISIVE THING TO DO, ESPECIALLY 

[Captioner] 19:31:31
WHEN THE ENTIRETY OF FREMONT IS 

[Captioner] 19:31:32
ALL -- I COULD SAY MOST OF US 

[Captioner] 19:31:34
CAME FROM IMMIGRANT BACKGROUNDS 

[Captioner] 19:31:36
AND MOST OF US ARE REFUGEES 

[Captioner] 19:31:37
COMING HERE FROM WAR TORN 

[Captioner] 19:31:38
COUNTRIES.

[Captioner] 19:31:40
AND HAVING TO FIND AND BUILD A 

[Captioner] 19:31:40
NEW PLACE HERE.

[Captioner] 19:31:42
AND BY CALLING FOR A CEASE FIRE 

[Captioner] 19:31:42
RESOLUTION, IT SHOWS THAT YOU 

[Captioner] 19:31:46
STAND WITH US AND YOU CARE FOR 

[Captioner] 19:31:47
US FOR THE COMMUNITY.

[Captioner] 19:31:48
YOUR VIEWPOINTS TELL US A LOT 

[Captioner] 19:31:51
ABOUT YOU AND IF YOU STAY INDY 

[Captioner] 19:31:53
CYSIVE OR INACTIONABLE ABOUT A 

[Captioner] 19:31:54
LITERAL GENOCIDE THAT IS 

[Captioner] 19:31:55
HAPPENING, YOU TELL US THAT YOU 

[Captioner] 19:31:57
DO NOT CARE FOR HUMANITY WHEN 

[Captioner] 19:31:58
IT'S NOT IN YOUR OWN CITY.

[Captioner] 19:32:02
AND UNFORTUNATELY, THE HARMFUL 

[Captioner] 19:32:03
RHETORICS THAT HAVE COME OUT OF 

[Captioner] 19:32:05
WHAT ISRAEL HAS BEEN SAYING 

[Captioner] 19:32:06
ABOUT PALESTINIANS, CALLING THEM 

[Captioner] 19:32:07
BARBARIC AND TERRORISTS, THESE 

[Captioner] 19:32:09
ARE ALL THINGS I GREW UP HEARING 

[Captioner] 19:32:11
GROWING UP AS A CHILD AS WELL.

[Captioner] 19:32:15
WHY IS IT ACCEPTABLE TO CALL

[Captioner] 19:32:19
 MIDDLE

[Captioner] 19:32:21
 EASTERNERS TERRORISTS?

[Captioner] 19:32:22
>> GOOD EVENING, COUNCILMEMBERS.

[Captioner] 19:32:24
WE STARTED OFF THIS MEETING WITH 

[Captioner] 19:32:27
THE PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE, 

[Captioner] 19:32:28
SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT WITH IT 

[Captioner] 19:32:29
IS LIBERTY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL.

[Captioner] 19:32:31
AS WE ALL KNOW IN THE HISTORY OF 

[Captioner] 19:32:32
AMERICA, IT HAS NOT ALWAYS BEEN 

[Captioner] 19:32:33
THAT WAY.

[Captioner] 19:32:35
AMERICA HAS HAD BLACK PEOPLE 

[Captioner] 19:32:37
ENSLAVED, AMERICA HAS HAD WOMEN 

[Captioner] 19:32:38
TREATED AS SECOND CLASS 

[Captioner] 19:32:39
CITIZENS, AMERICA HAS HAD THE 

[Captioner] 19:32:42
TRAIL OF TEARS, AMERICA HAS HAD 

[Captioner] 19:32:43
VERY ANTI-ASIAN RHETORIC 

[Captioner] 19:32:43
THROUGHOUTITY HISTORY.

[Captioner] 19:32:45
AMERICA USED TO HAVE CHILDREN 

[Captioner] 19:32:46
WORKING IN THE MINES.

[Captioner] 19:32:48
LIKE AMERICA IS NOT THE PERFECT 

[Captioner] 19:32:50
COUNTRY, AND IT DIDN'T MAGICALLY 

[Captioner] 19:32:50
CHANGE ON ITS OWN.

[Captioner] 19:32:52
IT'S BECAUSE PEOPLE SPOKE UP AND 

[Captioner] 19:32:53
IT'S BECAUSE PEOPLE LIKE THE 

[Captioner] 19:32:55
PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM CAME AND 

[Captioner] 19:32:55
SPOKE UP.

[Captioner] 19:32:57
IT'S BECAUSE PEOPLE LIKE YOU WHO 

[Captioner] 19:32:59
HAVE POWER SPOKE UP.

[Captioner] 19:33:00
THAT CHANGE WAS ABLE TO HAPPEN.

[Captioner] 19:33:01
ANYONE WHO COMES IN HERE AND 

[Captioner] 19:33:05
TRIES TO TELL YOU AGAINST THE 

[Captioner] 19:33:06
GENOCIDE WHICH HAS ALREADY BEEN 

[Captioner] 19:33:08
PROVEN BY HUMANITARIAN 

[Captioner] 19:33:08
ORGANIZATIONS INTERNATIONALLY AS 

[Captioner] 19:33:10
WELL AS THE INTERNATIONAL COURT 

[Captioner] 19:33:11
OF JUSTICE ARE THE SAME PEOPLE 

[Captioner] 19:33:13
WHO SAID OH, NOBODY TALK AGAINST 

[Captioner] 19:33:13
SLAVERY.

[Captioner] 19:33:15
OH, NOBODY TALK AGAINST THE 

[Captioner] 19:33:15
HOLOCAUST.

[Captioner] 19:33:17
OH, NOBODY SPEAK UP FOR WOMEN'S 

[Captioner] 19:33:17
RIGHTS.

[Captioner] 19:33:19
THESE ARE THE SAME TYPE OF 

[Captioner] 19:33:20
PEOPLE BUT THEY'RE TELLING YOU 

[Captioner] 19:33:23
TO NOT BELIEVE IN PALESTINE, NOT 

[Captioner] 19:33:25
TO SUPPORT PALESTINIAN 

[Captioner] 19:33:25
LIBERATION.

[Captioner] 19:33:35
>> Ms. Gauthier: SALIM FOLLOWED 

[Captioner] 19:33:37

[Captioner] 19:33:41
>> GOOD EVENING, LADIES AND 

[Captioner] 19:33:41
GENTLEMEN.

[Captioner] 19:33:45
I JUST HEARD $300 BILLION

[Captioner] 19:33:46
 HAVE BEEN GIVEN.

[Captioner] 19:33:48
WHY CAN'T WE GET SOME MONEY FOR 

[Captioner] 19:33:49
OUR HOMELESS PEOPLE HERE?

[Captioner] 19:33:54
WHY SO MUCH MONEY IS BEING SENT

[Captioner] 19:33:56
 OVERSEAS, AND MY PEOPLE IN 

[Captioner] 19:33:59
FREMONT ARE HOMELESS WITHOUT 

[Captioner] 19:34:00
BLANKETS, WITHOUT CLOTHES.

[Captioner] 19:34:03
COME ON.

[Captioner] 19:34:06
TWO WRONGS DON'T MAKE A RIGHT.

[Captioner] 19:34:08
IF ONE PARTY IS WRONG AND THE 

[Captioner] 19:34:09
OTHER PARTY IS WRONG, THEN OUR 

[Captioner] 19:34:13
MONEY IS BEING SENT TO KILL MORE 

[Captioner] 19:34:13
PEOPLE.

[Captioner] 19:34:15
IS THAT JUSTIFIED?

[Captioner] 19:34:18
AND PEOPLE ARE SAYING, WHEN THE 

[Captioner] 19:34:20
PEOPLE WERE KILLED IN GERMANY, 

[Captioner] 19:34:22
WE STOOD UP AGAINST THEM.

[Captioner] 19:34:24
PEOPLE FROM INDIA STOOD UP 

[Captioner] 19:34:25
AGAINST THE PEOPLE WHO KILLED 

[Captioner] 19:34:27
THE PEOPLE IN GERMANY.

[Captioner] 19:34:29
THE QUESTION IS, IF I WOULD 

[Captioner] 19:34:31
STATE THEIR NAME, IT IS A NO-NO, 

[Captioner] 19:34:32
NOT ALLOWED IN AMERICA.

[Captioner] 19:34:34
WHY?

[Captioner] 19:34:39
WHEN THE JEWS WERE KILLED IN THE

[Captioner] 19:34:39
 SYNAGOGUE --

[Captioner] 19:34:39
>> Ms. Gauthier: THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 19:34:49
>> GOOD EVENING.

[Captioner] 19:34:52
MY NAME IS OFMIN.

[Captioner] 19:34:53
CEASE FIRE WOULD SAVE LIVES.

[Captioner] 19:34:57
IT WOULD ALLOW FOOD, MEDICINE, 

[Captioner] 19:34:58
TO GO INTO GAZA.

[Captioner] 19:35:02
CURRENTLY, PEOPLE IN NORTH GAZA, 

[Captioner] 19:35:05
THEY ARE STARVING TO DEATH, 

[Captioner] 19:35:06
LITTLE KIDS EATING GRASS.

[Captioner] 19:35:10
CONTINUED BOMBING KILLS MORE 

[Captioner] 19:35:10
PEOPLE.

[Captioner] 19:35:14
YOU CANNOT -- IF YOU WANT TO 

[Captioner] 19:35:15
RESOLVE THE ISSUE YOU NEED TO 

[Captioner] 19:35:18
START WITH CEASE FIRE.

[Captioner] 19:35:19
THE FIGHTING HAS TO STOP.

[Captioner] 19:35:22
AND YOU CAN SEND A MESSAGE, YOU 

[Captioner] 19:35:24
CANNOT SEND FOOD TO GAZA, WE 

[Captioner] 19:35:24
UNDERSTAND THAT.

[Captioner] 19:35:27
BUT YOU CAN SEND THE FEDERAL 

[Captioner] 19:35:30
GOVERNMENT A MESSAGE THAT YOU 

[Captioner] 19:35:35
STAND WITH PEACE, ALLOW -- GIVE 

[Captioner] 19:35:36
PEACE A CHANCE.

[Captioner] 19:35:40
I HAVE A COUPLE OF THINGS, IF 

[Captioner] 19:35:41
YOU WANT TO EDUCATE YOURSELF, 

[Captioner] 19:35:44
THERE IS A MOVIE CALLED TOMTURA 

[Captioner] 19:35:47
AND THERE IS A MOVIE CALLED 

[Captioner] 19:35:47
ISRAELISM.

[Captioner] 19:35:49
THESE TWO WILL GIVE YOU A VERY 

[Captioner] 19:35:50
GOOD IDEA.

[Captioner] 19:35:50
[APPLAUSE]

[Captioner] 19:36:01
>> HELLO, COUNCIL, MAYOR.

[Captioner] 19:36:03
MY NAME IS THOMAS, I'M SPEAKING 

[Captioner] 19:36:04
ON CODE ENFORCEMENT.

[Captioner] 19:36:06
SOMETHING THAT HAS TO DO WITH 

[Captioner] 19:36:06
FREMONT.

[Captioner] 19:36:11
PAN CAL CORPORATION BUILT A 

[Captioner] 19:36:13
PROJECT AROUND MY HOUSE AND THEY 

[Captioner] 19:36:17
VIOLATED ALL THE DESIGN 

[Captioner] 19:36:18
GUIDELINE RULES.

[Captioner] 19:36:23
I'VE BEEN HERE THREE TIMES, 

[Captioner] 19:36:24
YOU'VE DONE NOTHING.

[Captioner] 19:36:25
LET ME READ TO YOU.

[Captioner] 19:36:28
RULES ARE MANDATORY REGULATIONS 

[Captioner] 19:36:31
THAT MUST BE SATISFIED BY ALL 

[Captioner] 19:36:32
DEVELOPMENTS TO WHICH THE 

[Captioner] 19:36:35
STANDARDS APPLY.

[Captioner] 19:36:36
THEY HAVE NOT COMPLIED WITH ANY 

[Captioner] 19:36:40
OF THE RULES TO PRIVACY OF MY 

[Captioner] 19:36:40
PROPERTY.

[Captioner] 19:36:42
I DISTRIBUTED A PHOTO, AND I 

[Captioner] 19:36:43
HAVE MANY MORE PHOTOS IF YOU'D 

[Captioner] 19:36:45
LIKE TO LOOK AT THEM.

[Captioner] 19:36:48
IT'S SOMETHING YOU HAVE 

[Captioner] 19:36:48
CONTROL.

[Captioner] 19:36:50
YOU HAVE THE POLICE POWER OF 

[Captioner] 19:36:50
FREMONT.

[Captioner] 19:36:53
AND I DON'T KNOW WHO TO GO TO 

[Captioner] 19:36:54
BESIDES YOU.

[Captioner] 19:37:02
SOME OF THE RULES --

[Captioner] 19:37:13
>> AS A MEMBER OF THIS COMMUNITY 

[Captioner] 19:37:15
FOR OVER 23 YEARS, I'M APPALLED 

[Captioner] 19:37:18
BY THE TRAVELING MOB WHO IS 

[Captioner] 19:37:20
GOING FROM ONE TOWN TO ANOTHER, 

[Captioner] 19:37:22
SPREADING LIES ABOUT WHAT'S 

[Captioner] 19:37:26
GOING ON IN THE WAR AND IN THE 

[Captioner] 19:37:27
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY AND 

[Captioner] 19:37:29
BULLYING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS LIKE 

[Captioner] 19:37:31
YOURS INTO ADOPTING A RESOLUTION 

[Captioner] 19:37:34
THAT NOT ONLY WILL NOT HAVE ANY 

[Captioner] 19:37:37
EFFECT ON THE WAR ITSELF AND ON 

[Captioner] 19:37:40
INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS, BUT 

[Captioner] 19:37:41
LEGITIMATE THE MOBS TO 

[Captioner] 19:37:45
PERPETRATE VIOLENCE AGAINST 

[Captioner] 19:37:47
JEWISH COMMUNITY ALL AROUND AND 

[Captioner] 19:37:48
VANDALISM AGAINST ANYONE WHO 

[Captioner] 19:37:49
DISAGREES WITH THEM.

[Captioner] 19:37:51
I ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT 

[Captioner] 19:37:53
YOU ARE AWARE THAT EVEN 

[Captioner] 19:37:56
INTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE 

[Captioner] 19:37:58
IN HAGUE DID NOT AGREE WITH WHAT 

[Captioner] 19:37:58
THIS MOB IS SAYING.

[Captioner] 19:38:01
DURING SUPER BOWL, TWO HOSTAGES 

[Captioner] 19:38:04
WERE RESCUED AND THE HUNDRED 

[Captioner] 19:38:06
PEOPLE WHO WERE KILLED WERE 

[Captioner] 19:38:07
ACTUALLY TERRORISTS, IT'S 

[Captioner] 19:38:11
PROVEN, YOU CAN SEE THE 

[Captioner] 19:38:13
DESCRIPTION OF --

[Captioner] 19:38:14

[Captioner] 19:39:06
NOTHING ELSE.

[Captioner] 19:39:11

[Captioner] 19:39:15
YOUR VOICE HAS BEEN HEARD AND 

[Captioner] 19:39:17
THAT THE COMMUNITY WILL 

[Captioner] 19:39:17

[Captioner] 19:39:19
IF YOU KNOW FREMONT IS VERY 

[Captioner] 19:39:19
DIVERSE COMMUNITY.

[Captioner] 19:39:22
IT'S NOT ONLY ONE GROUP.

[Captioner] 19:39:23
>> Ms. Gauthier: THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 19:39:34

[Captioner] 19:39:37
>> Ms. Gauthier: THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 19:39:40
>> ISRAEL WAS CONSTRUCTED IN THE 

[Captioner] 19:39:44

 THE MASS DISPOSITION OF ANOTHER 

[Captioner] 19:39:50
PEOPLE WHO REMAIN UNACKNOWLEDGED 

[Captioner] 19:39:53
JUST AS SORT OF OBSCURE NATIVES 

[Captioner] 19:39:55
IN THE BACKGROUND.

[Captioner] 19:40:00
THE OSWALD ACCORD SAYS 

[Captioner] 19:40:01
SPECIFICALLY THAT THEY BEAR NO 

[Captioner] 19:40:03
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE CAUSE OF 

[Captioner] 19:40:06

[Captioner] 19:40:12
DEPORTABLE PLACE ON EARTH 

[Captioner] 19:40:14
BECAUSE OF ISRAELIS POLICY 

[Captioner] 19:40:14
OCCUPATION.

[Captioner] 19:40:18
YOU CANNOT CONTINUE TO VICTIMIZE 

[Captioner] 19:40:20
SOMEONE JUST BECAUSE YOU WERE 

[Captioner] 19:40:21
VICTIM ONCE.

[Captioner] 19:40:22
PLEASE CALL CEASE FIRE.

[Captioner] 19:40:23
THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 19:40:30
>> Ms. Gauthier: ARE YOU KIM?

[Captioner] 19:40:30

[Captioner] 19:40:34
AND THEN THE LAST SPEAKER IS 

[Captioner] 19:40:34
ISTAPPA.

[Captioner] 19:40:37

[Captioner] 19:41:13
EVERYONE.

[Captioner] 19:41:14

[Captioner] 19:41:18
PALESTINIAN KIDS ARE NOT LESS 

[Captioner] 19:41:19
THAN ANYOF OUR KIDS.

[Captioner] 19:41:24
AS WE SPEAKING, GENOCIDE IS 

[Captioner] 19:41:26
TAKING PLACE, AND THE REASON WE 

[Captioner] 19:41:27
GET INVOLVED, OUR MONEY IS 

[Captioner] 19:41:27
INVOLVED.

[Captioner] 19:41:32
OUR GOVERNMENT MAKES US TO BE 

[Captioner] 19:41:33
INVOLVED BECAUSE THEY PAY FOR

THE BOMBS THAT'S KILLING 

[Captioner] 19:41:36

ANYWHERE IS NOT JUST 

[Captioner] 19:42:46
INTERNATIONAL ISSUE, IT'S OUR 

[Captioner] 19:42:46
ISSUE.

[Captioner] 19:42:48
I'M BEING A RESIDENT OF FREMONT 

[Captioner] 19:42:51
FOR LAST 40 YEARS, SINCE '84, SO 

[Captioner] 19:42:53
I'M REQUESTING, AND I VOTE FOR

CLOSE PUBLIC COMMENT AND RETURN 

[Captioner] 19:43:09
TO OUR REGULARLY SCHEDULED 

[Captioner] 19:43:09
AGENDA ITEMS.

[Captioner] 19:43:20
AT THIS TIME I'D LIKE TO INVITE 

[Captioner] 19:43:22
OUR PUBLIC WORKS DIRECTOR HANS 

[Captioner] 19:43:22
LARSEN.

[Captioner] 19:43:26
THIS IS ITEM 5A, WHICH IS 

[Captioner] 19:43:27
UPDATING SPEED LIMITS ON OUR 

[Captioner] 19:43:28
CITY STREETS.

[Captioner] 19:43:49
I ALSO NOTE THERE'S A GREEN 

[Captioner] 19:43:50
SHEET FOR ADDITIONAL 

[Captioner] 19:43:50
INFORMATION.

[Captioner] 19:43:50
THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 19:44:13
>> Mr. Larsen: GOOD EVENING, 

[Captioner] 19:44:15
MAYOR MEI AND MEMBERS OF THE 

[Captioner] 19:44:15
CITY COUNCIL.

[Captioner] 19:44:17
I'M HANS LARSEN, PUBLIC WORKS 

[Captioner] 19:44:17
DIRECTOR.

[Captioner] 19:44:20
JOINING ME ON THIS ITEM IS ERIK 

[Captioner] 19:44:23
HU, OUR CITY TRANSPORTATION 

[Captioner] 19:44:25
MANAGER, ALSO PRINCIPAL 

[Captioner] 19:44:27
TRANSPORTATION ENGINEER.

[Captioner] 19:44:29
THE PURPOSE OF THIS ITEM IS TO 

[Captioner] 19:44:31
CONSIDER AN UPDATE TO THE POSTED 

[Captioner] 19:44:35
SPEED LIMITS ESTABLISHED FOR 

[Captioner] 19:44:36
MAJOR STREETS IN FREMONT.

[Captioner] 19:44:38
JUST WANT TO CLARIFY, THIS DOES 

[Captioner] 19:44:39
NOT INCLUDE RESIDENTIAL STREETS, 

[Captioner] 19:44:41
WHICH ARE DEFINED UNDER STATE 

[Captioner] 19:44:43
LAW AS HAVING A 25-MILE AN HOUR 

[Captioner] 19:44:44
SPEED LIMIT AS A STANDARD.

[Captioner] 19:44:49
SO MAJOR STREETS ARE WHAT THIS 

[Captioner] 19:44:49
TOPIC IS ABOUT.

[Captioner] 19:44:51
THE PROCESS OF SETTING POSTED 

[Captioner] 19:44:53
SPEED LIMITS IS GOVERNED BY THE 

[Captioner] 19:44:54
STATE, AND IS GENERALLY REQUIRED 

[Captioner] 19:44:57
TO BE UPDATED EVERY FIVE TO 

[Captioner] 19:45:00
SEVEN YEARS, AND THE SETTING OF 

[Captioner] 19:45:02
SPEED LIMITS IS BASED ON THE 

[Captioner] 19:45:04
ACTUAL OPERATING CONDITION OF 

[Captioner] 19:45:07
THE STREETS THAT IS SURVEYED AND 

[Captioner] 19:45:09
DOCUMENTED IN AN ENGINEERING AND 

[Captioner] 19:45:10
TRAFFIC SURVEY REPORT.

[Captioner] 19:45:13
IT IS NOTED THAT STATE 

[Captioner] 19:45:14
LEGISLATION HAS RECENTLY BEEN 

[Captioner] 19:45:17
APPROVED THAT ALLOWS CITIES MORE 

[Captioner] 19:45:19
DISCRETION IN MANAGING SPEEDS 

[Captioner] 19:45:22
BASED ON CRASH HISTORY, LAND 

[Captioner] 19:45:24
USE, AND THE SAFETY FOR PEOPLE 

[Captioner] 19:45:25
WALKING AND BICYCLING.

[Captioner] 19:45:28
THE SAFETY ORIENTATION IS 

[Captioner] 19:45:30
CONSISTENT WITH FREMONT'S VISION 

[Captioner] 19:45:32
ZERO TRAFFIC SAFETY POLICY, AND 

[Captioner] 19:45:34
USE OF THIS NEW STATE DISCRETION 

[Captioner] 19:45:36
IS SOMETHING THAT WE'RE 

[Captioner] 19:45:38
RECOMMENDING, AND IT'S RESULTING 

[Captioner] 19:45:40
IN A REDUCTION IN CURRENT SPEED 

[Captioner] 19:45:44
LIMITS BY 5 MILES PER HOUR ALONG 

[Captioner] 19:45:45
30 STREET SEGMENTS.

[Captioner] 19:45:49
THE PROCESS THAT WE'RE 

[Captioner] 19:45:52
UNDERTAKING HERE STARTS WITH, 

[Captioner] 19:45:53
TONIGHT, INTRODUCTION OF AN 

[Captioner] 19:45:55
ORDINANCE AND HOLDING A PUBLIC 

[Captioner] 19:45:57
HEARING TO CONSIDER AN UPDATE TO 

[Captioner] 19:45:58
THE CITY'S SPEED LIMITS.

[Captioner] 19:46:00
THERE WILL BE A SECOND READING 

[Captioner] 19:46:01
AND APPROVAL OF THE ORDINANCE, 

[Captioner] 19:46:03
WHICH IS PROPOSED TO OCCUR IN 

[Captioner] 19:46:05
TWO WEEKS, ON MARCH 5TH.

[Captioner] 19:46:09
AND THEN ONCE COUNCIL TAKES 

[Captioner] 19:46:10
ACTION, THEN CITY CREWS WILL 

[Captioner] 19:46:13
NEED TO CHANGE SIGNS ON THE 

[Captioner] 19:46:14
STREETS WHERE THERE IS A 

[Captioner] 19:46:16
PROPOSED CHANGE TO THE SPEED 

[Captioner] 19:46:17
LIMITS, AND THEN ONLY AFTER THE 

[Captioner] 19:46:20
SIGNS ARE POSTED WILL THE NEW 

[Captioner] 19:46:22
SPEED LIMITS BE IN EFFECT.

[Captioner] 19:46:25
JUST WANT TO ALSO CLARIFY THAT 

[Captioner] 19:46:27
ON THE GREEN SHEET SUPPLEMENTAL 

[Captioner] 19:46:30
INFORMATION, THAT THE TECHNICAL 

[Captioner] 19:46:32
REPORT RELATED TO THIS ITEM, THE 

[Captioner] 19:46:35
ENGINEERING AND TRAFFIC SURVEY 

[Captioner] 19:46:39
REPORT, IT HAS A DATE OF

[Captioner] 19:46:43
 JANUARY 29TH, 2024, RATHER THAN 

[Captioner] 19:46:44
DECEMBER 2023, AS WAS REFERENCED 

[Captioner] 19:46:46
IN THE STAFF REPORT, AND THEN 

[Captioner] 19:46:47
IT'S NOTED THAT A COPY OF THIS 

[Captioner] 19:46:50
REPORT WAS POSTED TODAY ON THE 

[Captioner] 19:46:52
CITY'S WEBSITE, AND A HARD COPY 

[Captioner] 19:46:53
HAS BEEN PROVIDED TO THE CITY 

[Captioner] 19:46:53
CLERK'S OFFICE.

[Captioner] 19:46:58
THAT CONCLUDES MY REMARKS.

[Captioner] 19:46:59
ERIC AND I ARE HERE TO ANSWER 

[Captioner] 19:47:00
ANY QUESTIONS AND I'LL TURN IT 

[Captioner] 19:47:01
BACK OVER TO THE MAYOR.

[Captioner] 19:47:01
THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 19:47:03
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 19:47:08
FIRST FOR CLARIFYING QUESTIONS, 

[Captioner] 19:47:10
IS THAT VICE MAYOR SHAO?

[Captioner] 19:47:10
THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 19:47:13
>> Vice Mayor Shao: THANK YOU, 

[Captioner] 19:47:13
MADAME MAYOR.

[Captioner] 19:47:17
I HAVE A FEW CLARIFYING 

[Captioner] 19:47:17
QUESTIONS.

[Captioner] 19:47:22
FIRST OF ALL, I READ

[Captioner] 19:47:23
 THE SURVEY REPORT AND I'M VERY 

[Captioner] 19:47:26
GRATEFUL THAT BY WORKING WITH 

[Captioner] 19:47:29
THIS CONSULTING COMPANY AND THE 

[Captioner] 19:47:31
SURVEY COLLECTED A LOT OF DATA, 

[Captioner] 19:47:33
AND YOU KNOW, I'M A DATA PERSON, 

[Captioner] 19:47:34
AND I LIKE TO READ DATA.

[Captioner] 19:47:37
BUT BY READING THE DATA, THERE'S 

[Captioner] 19:47:40
SOME QUESTIONS THAT I HAVE TO 

[Captioner] 19:47:41
ASK TO AVOID BEING CONFUSED.

[Captioner] 19:47:47
SO TYPICALLY YOU LISTED IN

[Captioner] 19:47:52
 YOUR TABLE A 10-MILE PER

[Captioner] 19:47:58
 HOUR PACE WRENCH BUT

[Captioner] 19:48:03
 THIS PACE WRENCH TO ME IS MORE 

[Captioner] 19:48:04
LIKE A 9-MILE AN HOUR RANGE 

[Captioner] 19:48:06
BECAUSE IF I LOOK AT THE 

[Captioner] 19:48:07
STARTING POINT AND THE ENDING 

[Captioner] 19:48:09
POINT, THE DIFFERENCE IS ONLY 9 

[Captioner] 19:48:09
INSTEAD OF 10.

[Captioner] 19:48:13
AND IT'S SYSTEMATIC IN YOUR 

[Captioner] 19:48:13
SYSTEM.

[Captioner] 19:48:16
I MUST BE WRONG SOMEWHERE.

[Captioner] 19:48:19
BECAUSE OTHERWISE IT WOULD NOT 

[Captioner] 19:48:21
LEAD TO THIS MISUNDERSTANDING.

[Captioner] 19:48:25
SO CAN YOU EXPLAIN TO ME FIRST 

[Captioner] 19:48:28
OF ALL FOR THIS 10 MILES PER 

[Captioner] 19:48:32
HOUR RANGE, HOW COME IN YOUR 

[Captioner] 19:48:36
JUSTIFICATION YOU WILL SEE IN 

[Captioner] 19:48:39
ALL CASES THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN 

[Captioner] 19:48:40
THE LOWER LIMIT AND UPPER LIMIT 

[Captioner] 19:48:41
IS ACTUALLY 9 MILES PER HOUR.

[Captioner] 19:48:54
>> GENERALLY SPEAKING, IT IS 

[Captioner] 19:48:55
INCLUSIVE OF THE -- I MEAN, THE 

[Captioner] 19:48:58
MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM RANGE, MY 

[Captioner] 19:49:01
UNDERSTANDING, AND SO BASED ON 

[Captioner] 19:49:02
THE DATA CALCULATION, I BELIEVE 

[Captioner] 19:49:06
IT IS ACTUALLY 10-MILE AN HOUR 

[Captioner] 19:49:06
RANGE.

[Captioner] 19:49:08
IT'S INCLUSIVE OF BOTH THE LOW 

[Captioner] 19:49:09
END NUMBER AND THE HIGH END 

[Captioner] 19:49:09
NUMBER.

[Captioner] 19:49:12
DOES THAT --

[Captioner] 19:49:14
>> Vice Mayor Shao: IF YOU DO 

[Captioner] 19:49:19
THE CALCULATION FROM

[Captioner] 19:49:21
 1 TO -- SO YOU MEAN LIKE FROM, 

[Captioner] 19:49:28
FOR EXAMPLE, 34.0 TO 43.0, OR

[Captioner] 19:49:33
 FROM 34.0 TO

[Captioner] 19:49:36
 33.99?

[Captioner] 19:49:38
BECAUSE OTHERWISE I STILL SEE -- 

[Captioner] 19:49:41
DO THE SIMPLE MATH, I STILL SEE 

[Captioner] 19:49:42
THE 9-MILE PER HOUR DIFFERENCE, 

[Captioner] 19:49:43
NOT A 10-MILE.

[Captioner] 19:49:47
EVEN THOUGH BOTH ENDS ARE 

[Captioner] 19:49:48
INCLUSIVE, I UNDERSTAND THAT.

[Captioner] 19:49:48
>> RIGHT.

[Captioner] 19:49:52
WE CAN CONFIRM THAT WITH THE 

[Captioner] 19:49:55
CONSULTANT, BUT MY UNDERSTANDING 

[Captioner] 19:49:57
IS IT IS -- LIKE FOR EXAMPLE, IF 

[Captioner] 19:49:58
THE 10-MILE AN HOUR PACE RANGE 

[Captioner] 19:50:01
IS FROM 25 TO 34, IT'S ACTUALLY 

[Captioner] 19:50:05
INCLUSIVE OF THE -- STARTING 

[Captioner] 19:50:09
FROM 25.0 ALL THE WAY THROUGH TO 

[Captioner] 19:50:09
34.9 IN THIS CASE.

[Captioner] 19:50:17
SO -- YEAH.

[Captioner] 19:50:18
>> Vice Mayor Shao: THANK YOU 

[Captioner] 19:50:19
VERY MUCH FOR FOLLOWING UP WITH 

[Captioner] 19:50:23
THE CONSULTANT, BECAUSE THIS IS 

[Captioner] 19:50:23
CERTAINLY NOT MY UNDERSTANDING 

[Captioner] 19:50:25
OF THE CALCULATION OF THE 

[Captioner] 19:50:25
RANGE.

[Captioner] 19:50:30
SO THEN ANOTHER QUESTION I HAVE 

[Captioner] 19:50:34
IS THAT WHEN YOU TRY TO JUSTIFY 

[Captioner] 19:50:38
THE CHANGES OR NO CHANGES, IT 

[Captioner] 19:50:42
SEEMS LIKE THAT YOU DON'T ALWAYS 

[Captioner] 19:50:44
FOLLOW THE 85 PERCENTILE 

[Captioner] 19:50:47
MEASUREMENT OR SURVEY.

[Captioner] 19:50:52
IF IT'S HIGHER THAN

[Captioner] 19:50:56
 THE EXISTING POSTED SPEED 

[Captioner] 19:51:00
LIMIT, THEN YOU WOULD USE A 

[Captioner] 19:51:02
RANGE AND SAY, OKAY, IT'S STILL 

[Captioner] 19:51:04
WITHIN THE 10-MILE RANGE SO 

[Captioner] 19:51:05
THERE'S NO INCREASE.

[Captioner] 19:51:09
BUT IF THE SPEED

[Captioner] 19:51:12
 IS LOWER THAN THE CURRENT ONE, 

[Captioner] 19:51:15
THEN YOU USE ANOTHER LOGIC AND 

[Captioner] 19:51:18
SAY OKAY, NOW LET'S REDUCE THE 

[Captioner] 19:51:18
SPEED.

[Captioner] 19:51:22
SO FOR ME, MY ONLY CONCERN IS 

[Captioner] 19:51:26
THAT FOR CERTAIN -- LIKE 

[Captioner] 19:51:28
ARTERIES, ARTERY ROADS IN THE 

[Captioner] 19:51:33
CITY, FOR EXAMPLE, STEVENSON, 

[Captioner] 19:51:37
MOWRY, AND FREMONT AND PASEO 

[Captioner] 19:51:40
PADRE, USING DIFFERENT LOGICS TO 

[Captioner] 19:51:43
JUSTIFY THE CHANGES OR NO 

[Captioner] 19:51:46
CHANGES WILL INEVITABLY LIMIT 

[Captioner] 19:51:48
THE SPEED LIMIT FOR CERTAIN 

[Captioner] 19:51:50
PARTS OF THOSE ARTERY ROADS AND 

[Captioner] 19:51:51
CAUSE CONGESTION.

[Captioner] 19:51:53
SO THAT IS MY QUESTION.

[Captioner] 19:51:55
I SEE TWO DIFFERENT LOGIC.

[Captioner] 19:51:56
IS THAT TRUE?

[Captioner] 19:51:58
>> I MEAN, GENERALLY SPEAKING, 

[Captioner] 19:52:02
OUR LOGIC IS TO TRY TO, PER OUR 

[Captioner] 19:52:05
VISION ZERO POLICY, IS TO MANAGE 

[Captioner] 19:52:08
THE SPEED, IN THIS CASE, THE 

[Captioner] 19:52:09
POSTED SPEED LIMIT ON THE CORE 

[Captioner] 19:52:09
CORE.

[Captioner] 19:52:12
 CORRIDOR.

[Captioner] 19:52:15
WE DO EU GENERALLY SPEAKING, THE 

[Captioner] 19:52:16
85 PERCENTILE RULE SO TO SPEAK, 

[Captioner] 19:52:20
BUT NOT LITERALLY TO THE SENSE 

[Captioner] 19:52:22
BECAUSE THE STATE ALSO GIVES US 

[Captioner] 19:52:25
AUTHORITY TO -- BASED ON THE 

[Captioner] 19:52:26
85TH PERCENTILE SPEED BUT ALSO 

[Captioner] 19:52:28
USE ENGINEERING JUDGMENT TO 

[Captioner] 19:52:30
ADJUST IT FURTHER AS NECESSARY.

[Captioner] 19:52:37
SO FOR EXAMPLE, IF

[Captioner] 19:52:38
 THE 85 PERCENTILE SPEED IS, 

[Captioner] 19:52:40
LET'S JUST SAY 33 MILES AN HOUR, 

[Captioner] 19:52:44
FOR EXAMPLE, PER CURRENT

[Captioner] 19:52:46
 LANGUAGE IN THE STATE CODE, WE 

[Captioner] 19:52:49
HAVE TO ROUND IT UP TO 35 MILES 

[Captioner] 19:52:51
AN HOUR FOR THE POSTED SPEED 

[Captioner] 19:52:51
LIMIT.

[Captioner] 19:52:53
HOWEVER, WE DO HAVE THE 

[Captioner] 19:52:56
AUTHORITY TO LOWER THAT BY AN 

[Captioner] 19:52:58
ADDITIONAL 5 MILES AN HOUR AND 

[Captioner] 19:52:59
SET TO 30 MILES AN HOUR.

[Captioner] 19:53:00
THAT'S GENERALLY WHAT WE TRY TO 

[Captioner] 19:53:01
DO.

[Captioner] 19:53:04
HOWEVER, THERE MAY BE ALSO 

[Captioner] 19:53:06
SITUATIONS WHERE WE ALSO 

[Captioner] 19:53:08
ESTABLISH WHAT THEY CALL PRIMA 

[Captioner] 19:53:12
FACIE SPEED, AND SO EITHER 25 OR 

[Captioner] 19:53:15
UNDER CERTAIN SITUATIONS, SO IT 

[Captioner] 19:53:17
DOESN'T REALLY REQUIRE US TO 

[Captioner] 19:53:19
FOLLOW THE 85 PERCENTILE RULE TO 

[Captioner] 19:53:23
THE -- LIKE OTHER ROADS WOULD, 

[Captioner] 19:53:27
AND SO THAT'S GENERALLY TALKING 

[Captioner] 19:53:28
WITHOUT GOING SPECIFIC ROADWAY 

[Captioner] 19:53:29
SEGMENTS THE GENERAL RULE THAT 

[Captioner] 19:53:29
WE FOLLOW.

[Captioner] 19:53:31
>> Vice Mayor Shao: YES, I 

[Captioner] 19:53:32
CERTAINLY RECOGNIZE THAT WE DO 

[Captioner] 19:53:34
HAVE THE AUTHORITY, OTHERWISE 

[Captioner] 19:53:36
THIS DISCUSSION IS MOOT, RIGHT?

[Captioner] 19:53:41
SO I HAVE A FOLLOW-UP QUESTION.

[Captioner] 19:53:46
SO THIS SURVEY IS DONE AFTER WE 

[Captioner] 19:53:48
APPLIED A VISION ZERO FOR MORE 

[Captioner] 19:53:50
THAN FIVE YEARS AND PUT ALL 

[Captioner] 19:53:54
KINDS OF APPROACHES TO SLOW

[Captioner] 19:53:58
 PEOPLE DOWN, FOR EXAMPLE, 

[Captioner] 19:54:01
NARROWING THE LANES, PUTTING UP 

[Captioner] 19:54:04
THE WHITE STICKS, AND AMONG ALL 

[Captioner] 19:54:05
THE OTHER THINGS.

[Captioner] 19:54:08
AND THEN YOU MAKE THE SURVEY AND 

[Captioner] 19:54:11
SURE, PEOPLE ARE DRIVING MORE 

[Captioner] 19:54:14
SLOWLY, NOW YOU SLOW DOWN THE 

[Captioner] 19:54:14
LIMIT.

[Captioner] 19:54:16
ANOTHER ROUND OF SURVEY, BECAUSE 

[Captioner] 19:54:21
OF THIS NEWLY POSTED SPEED 

[Captioner] 19:54:23
LIMIT, PEOPLE ARE GOING TO SLOW 

[Captioner] 19:54:23
DOWN EVEN MORE.

[Captioner] 19:54:28
SO I WOULD NOT SEE A VICIOUS 

[Captioner] 19:54:33
CYCLE BASICALLY GOING AROUND TO

[Captioner] 19:54:38
 REALLY HALT THE

[Captioner] 19:54:38
 TRAFFIC -- GOING TO A HALT.

[Captioner] 19:54:41
SO IF YOU CONSIDERED THE 

[Captioner] 19:54:44
EXISTING APPROACHES TO SLOW 

[Captioner] 19:54:46
PEOPLE DOWN IN THE SURVEY AND 

[Captioner] 19:54:48
ALSO IN YOUR JUSTIFICATION FOR 

[Captioner] 19:54:50
FURTHER REDUCING THE SPEED LIMIT?

[Captioner] 19:54:53
SO WHAT IS THE EGG, WHAT IS THE 

[Captioner] 19:54:54
HEN, YOU KNOW?

[Captioner] 19:54:59
I'M THINKING ABOUT THIS CAUSAL

[Captioner] 19:55:00
 RELATIONSHIP.

[Captioner] 19:55:02
>> Mr. Larsen: LET ME KIND OF 

[Captioner] 19:55:03
SPEAK TO THAT IN TERMS OF KIND 

[Captioner] 19:55:05
OF AN OUTCOME THAT WE'RE TRYING 

[Captioner] 19:55:05
TO ACHIEVE.

[Captioner] 19:55:09
I THINK THE PRIMARY OUTCOME SORT 

[Captioner] 19:55:11
OF IS DEFINED BY THE VISION ZERO 

[Captioner] 19:55:13
POLICY IS SAFETY FIRST AND WE 

[Captioner] 19:55:15
WANT TO BUILD A MULTIMODAL 

[Captioner] 19:55:16
SYSTEM THAT'S COMFORTABLE FOR 

[Captioner] 19:55:19
ALL USERS AND PARTICULARLY 

[Captioner] 19:55:21
PEOPLE THAT ARE WALKING AND 

[Captioner] 19:55:22
BIKING, SENIORS AND THE YOUTH.

[Captioner] 19:55:27
THE PAST PRACTICE SORT OF WITH 

[Captioner] 19:55:30
THE STATE POLICY HAS BEEN THAT 

[Captioner] 19:55:33
SPEED LIMITS ARE SET BASED ON 

[Captioner] 19:55:33
HOW FAST PEOPLE WANT TO GO.

[Captioner] 19:55:37
AND THERE HAS BEEN FOR MANY 

[Captioner] 19:55:39
DECADES THAT UNDER THAT 

[Captioner] 19:55:41
APPROACH, PEOPLE DRIVE FASTER, 

[Captioner] 19:55:44
YOU SET THE SPEED LIMITS HIGHER, 

[Captioner] 19:55:45
THEY DRIVE FASTER, THE SPEEDS GO 

[Captioner] 19:55:47
HIGHER, SO THIS VICIOUS CYCLE 

[Captioner] 19:55:48
YOU'RE KIND OF SPEAKING OF KIND 

[Captioner] 19:55:52
OF IN REVERSE HAS CREATED A 

[Captioner] 19:55:54
SITUATION WHERE FOLKS ARE 

[Captioner] 19:55:59
DRIVING 45, 50, 55 MILES AN HOUR 

[Captioner] 19:56:00
AND SPEED LIMITS ARE SET AT THAT 

[Captioner] 19:56:01
AND THEN THEY GO EVEN FASTER.

[Captioner] 19:56:05
WHAT IS A KIND OF A BEST 

[Captioner] 19:56:07
PRACTICE FOR CITIES ON URBAN 

[Captioner] 19:56:08
STREETS TO PROVIDE A BALANCE, 

[Captioner] 19:56:10
AND THIS IS I THINK WHAT WE'RE 

[Captioner] 19:56:16
TRYING TO ACHIEVE, A BALANCE OF 

[Captioner] 19:56:18
SAFETY AND EFFICIENCY ON OUR 

[Captioner] 19:56:19
STREETS, AND REALLY THE SWEET 

[Captioner] 19:56:23
SPOT IS TO HAVE ON

[Captioner] 19:56:26
 YOUR URBAN STREETS, PEOPLE NOT 

[Captioner] 19:56:27
TRAVELING MORE THAN 35 MILES AN 

[Captioner] 19:56:27
HOUR.

[Captioner] 19:56:30
AND THAT'S REALLY AN 

[Captioner] 19:56:32
INTERNATIONAL BEST PRACTICE OF 

[Captioner] 19:56:35
WHAT YOU WOULD WANT TO HAVE FOR 

[Captioner] 19:56:36
YOUR STREETS, SO THE GOAL IS TO 

[Captioner] 19:56:38
HAVE TRAFFIC MOVE EFFICIENTLY, 

[Captioner] 19:56:39
BUT NOT TOO FAST.

[Captioner] 19:56:43
AND THERE IS A -- WE INCLUDED 

[Captioner] 19:56:45
THIS IN THE STAFF REPORT, 

[Captioner] 19:56:48
THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN 

[Captioner] 19:56:49
THE SURVIVABILITY OF A 

[Captioner] 19:56:54
PEDESTRIAN BEING HIT AT 35 MILES 

[Captioner] 19:56:56
AN HOUR, THEN WHEN IT JUMPS TO 

[Captioner] 19:56:57
40 OR HIGHER.

[Captioner] 19:57:00
SO THE DATA HAS SHOWN, THERE'S 

[Captioner] 19:57:03
LIKE A 35 -- AT 35 MILES AN 

[Captioner] 19:57:06
HOUR, A PEDESTRIAN IS ABOUT 35% 

[Captioner] 19:57:10
LIKELY TO DIE.

[Captioner] 19:57:14
AS THE SPEED OF THE IMPACT GOES

[Captioner] 19:57:18
 TO 40, IT'S 68% CHANCE OF 

[Captioner] 19:57:18
DYING.

[Captioner] 19:57:20
SO THAT IS KIND OF, YOU KNOW, 

[Captioner] 19:57:23
SORT OF WHAT BASES THAT SORT OF 

[Captioner] 19:57:25
DESIRABLE SPEED LIMIT IN AN 

[Captioner] 19:57:26
URBAN AREA THAT CREATES AN 

[Captioner] 19:57:30
ENVIRONMENT WHERE PEOPLE AREN'T 

[Captioner] 19:57:30
DYING.

[Captioner] 19:57:31
IT ALSO REDUCES THE TIME.

[Captioner] 19:57:36
SO I THINK WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO

[Captioner] 19:57:37
 DO, AND WE STILL HAVE MANY 

[Captioner] 19:57:39
STREETS THAT ARE ABOVE 35 MILES 

[Captioner] 19:57:41
AN HOUR EVEN WITH THIS.

[Captioner] 19:57:44
WE STILL HAVE SOME 40, 45, BUT I 

[Captioner] 19:57:47
THINK IN THE COMBINATION OF 

[Captioner] 19:57:49
STREET DESIGN CHANGES AND THEN 

[Captioner] 19:57:51
BEING ABLE TO USE THE KIND OF 

[Captioner] 19:57:54
NEW STATE AUTHORITY, WHICH IS 

[Captioner] 19:57:55
ORIENTED TOWARDS ASSISTING 

[Captioner] 19:57:58
CITIES THAT ARE PURSUING VISION 

[Captioner] 19:57:58
ZERO-TYPE GOALS.

[Captioner] 19:58:02
WE'RE ABLE TO MOVE IN THAT 

[Captioner] 19:58:02
DIRECTION.

[Captioner] 19:58:05
STREETS THAT YOU MENTIONED, 

[Captioner] 19:58:07
STEVENSON, PASEO PADRE PARKWAY, 

[Captioner] 19:58:11
MOWRY, ALL OF THESE ARE AT 35, 

[Captioner] 19:58:13
IN SOME CASES HIGHER THAN THAT, 

[Captioner] 19:58:16
AND I WOULDN'T IMAGINE SEEING 

[Captioner] 19:58:18
THEM GO BELOW 35 MILES AN HOUR 

[Captioner] 19:58:20
IN THE INTEREST OF PROVIDING 

[Captioner] 19:58:22
KIND OF A GOOD BALANCE.

[Captioner] 19:58:25
AND IF THE COUNCIL IS INTERESTED 

[Captioner] 19:58:27
IN IT, WE ARE DOING A LOT OF 

[Captioner] 19:58:29
GREAT WORK LED BY ERIC AND HIS 

[Captioner] 19:58:32
TEAM TO COORDINATE TRAFFIC 

[Captioner] 19:58:37
SIGNAL TIMING AT A 35-MILE AN 

[Captioner] 19:58:39
HOUR PACE SPEED SO THAT TRAFFIC 

[Captioner] 19:58:43
IS ACTUALLY MOVING FASTER 

[Captioner] 19:58:44
THROUGH THE CITY, LESS STOPPING 

[Captioner] 19:58:46
AT RED LIGHTS, THEY CAN GET 

[Captioner] 19:58:49
THROUGH A CORRIDOR MORE 

[Captioner] 19:58:51
EFFICIENTLY, BUT TRAVELING AT 

[Captioner] 19:58:53
LIKE A 35-MILE AN HOUR PACE 

[Captioner] 19:58:54
SPEED AND HITTING THE TRAFFIC 

[Captioner] 19:58:57
SIGNAL TIMING ON GREENS AS 

[Captioner] 19:58:58
OPPOSED TO GETTING A LOT OF 

[Captioner] 19:58:58
RED.

[Captioner] 19:59:00
SO THAT'S THE BALANCE WE'RE 

[Captioner] 19:59:03
TRYING TO STRIKE TWEENL SAFE 

[Captioner] 19:59:07
SPEED BUT -- BETWEEN SAFE SPEED 

[Captioner] 19:59:08
BUT THEN ALSO EFFICIENCY ALONG 

[Captioner] 19:59:09
THE WHOLE SYSTEM.

[Captioner] 19:59:10
THERE'S BEEN SOME GREAT WORK 

[Captioner] 19:59:12
DONE ON STEVENSON AND PASEO 

[Captioner] 19:59:13
PADRE PARKWAY RECENTLY.

[Captioner] 19:59:18
HOPEFULLY YOU'VE NOTICED THAT 

[Captioner] 19:59:19
THE COORDINATION OF THOSE 

[Captioner] 19:59:20
TRAFFIC SIGNALS IS MUCH BETTER 

[Captioner] 19:59:21
NOW THAN IT WAS A YEAR AGO.

[Captioner] 19:59:26
SORRY FOR THE LONG ANSWER, BUT I 

[Captioner] 19:59:27
THINK IT KIND OF PUT ALL OF THIS 

[Captioner] 19:59:29
IN A LITTLE BIT OF A CONTEXT AND 

[Captioner] 19:59:32
THE BALANCE THAT WE'RE TRYING TO 

[Captioner] 19:59:32
STRIKE.

[Captioner] 19:59:33
>> Vice Mayor Shao: THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 19:59:35
I'LL GIVE OTHER COUNCIL MEMBERS 

[Captioner] 19:59:36
A CHANCE TO ASK QUESTIONS.

[Captioner] 19:59:36
>> Mayor Mei: SURE.

[Captioner] 19:59:38
CLARIFYING QUESTIONS, 

[Captioner] 19:59:38
COUNCILMEMBER COX, PLEASE.

[Captioner] 19:59:44
>> Councilmember Cox: THANK 

[Captioner] 19:59:44
YOU.

[Captioner] 19:59:47
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SHARING 

[Captioner] 19:59:47
THIS REPORT.

[Captioner] 19:59:49
I DID HAVE A COUPLE OF 

[Captioner] 19:59:49
QUESTIONS.

[Captioner] 19:59:53
ONE OF THEM IS

[Captioner] 19:59:56
 THAT AS WE'VE SEEN IN THE 

[Captioner] 19:59:57
REPORT, YOU HAVE THE LIST OF 30 

[Captioner] 19:59:59
ROADWAYS THAT ARE BEING PROPOSED 

[Captioner] 20:00:03
FOR DECREASING THE SPEED LIMIT.

[Captioner] 20:00:05
OF THOSE, ARE ALL OF THEM GOING 

[Captioner] 20:00:06
TO HAVE THE NEW TRAFFIC LIGHTS 

[Captioner] 20:00:09
THAT ARE GOING TO BE WHAT WE'VE 

[Captioner] 20:00:11
PLANNED FOR OVER THE NEXT COUPLE 

[Captioner] 20:00:15
YEARS, ARE THOSE ALL UPDATED TO

[Captioner] 20:00:20
 BE SYNCED IN THESE LIST OF

[Captioner] 20:00:20
 STREETS?

[Captioner] 20:00:20
?

[Captioner] 20:00:22
>> Mr. Larsen: LET ME GIVE YOU A 

[Captioner] 20:00:24
LITTLE ANSWER AND THEN I'LL TURN 

[Captioner] 20:00:27
IT OVER TO ERIC IN TERMS OF 

[Captioner] 20:00:29
STREETS WHERE WE'VE DONE SIGNAL 

[Captioner] 20:00:30
COORDINATION AND THEN WHAT WE 

[Captioner] 20:00:31
HAVE PLANNED IN THE NEXT YEAR.

[Captioner] 20:00:33
SO I'LL JUST NOTE, THERE'S A 

[Captioner] 20:00:39
TOTAL OF 171 STREET SEGMENTS 

[Captioner] 20:00:41
THAT MAKE UP OUR MAJOR STREET 

[Captioner] 20:00:43
SYSTEM, SO TO PUT INTO CONTEXT, 

[Captioner] 20:00:46
IT'S LESS THAN 20% OF THOSE 

[Captioner] 20:00:47
STREETS ARE HAVE SOMETHING A 

[Captioner] 20:00:51
 -- ARE HAVING A SPEED LIMIT

[Captioner] 20:00:53
 REDUCTION, THE REST OF THEM ARE 

[Captioner] 20:00:53
STAYING THE SAME.

[Captioner] 20:00:56
SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A FAIRLY 

[Captioner] 20:00:57
SMALL SUBSET OF OUR OVERALL 

[Captioner] 20:00:57
STREETS.

[Captioner] 20:01:00
BUT ERIC, IF YOU COULD SPEAK TO 

[Captioner] 20:01:03
THE RECENT WORK DONE IN THE LAST 

[Captioner] 20:01:06
YEAR IN TERMS OF CORRIDORS THAT 

[Captioner] 20:01:07
HAVE BEEN COORDINATED IN TERMS 

[Captioner] 20:01:09
OF SIGNAL TIMING AND THEN WHAT 

[Captioner] 20:01:12
WE HAVE PLANNED, AND THERE ISN'T 

[Captioner] 20:01:13
A CORRELATION BETWEEN WHAT WE'RE 

[Captioner] 20:01:15
TALKING ABOUT HERE TONIGHT IN 

[Captioner] 20:01:18
TERMS OF LOWERING SPEED LIMITS, 

[Captioner] 20:01:20
IT'S RELATED BUT REALLY SEPARATE 

[Captioner] 20:01:20
TOPICS.

[Captioner] 20:01:24
>> MR. HU:  THANKS, HANS.

[Captioner] 20:01:28
LONG STORY -- SHORT ANSWER IS 

[Captioner] 20:01:31
SOME OF THE STREETS ARE ON THAT 

[Captioner] 20:01:31
COORDINATION LIST.

[Captioner] 20:01:35
SOME OF THE STREETS HAVE ALREADY 

[Captioner] 20:01:36
HAVE COORDINATION IMPLEMENTED, 

[Captioner] 20:01:38
FOR EXAMPLE, FREMONT BOULEVARD, 

[Captioner] 20:01:40
PASEO PADRE, MOWRY AVENUE, 

[Captioner] 20:01:41
STEVENSON BOULEVARD.

[Captioner] 20:01:43
SOME OF THE STREETS TECHNICALLY 

[Captioner] 20:01:45
WOULDN'T BE ON THE COORDINATION 

[Captioner] 20:01:46
LIST BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO OR 

[Captioner] 20:01:48
VERY MINIMAL SIGNALIZED 

[Captioner] 20:01:49
INTERSECTIONS ON IT.

[Captioner] 20:01:52
AND SO IT REALLY DEPENDS.

[Captioner] 20:01:54
HOWEVER, OUR GOAL SO FAR TO 

[Captioner] 20:01:56
DATE, WE HAVE COORDINATED MOST 

[Captioner] 20:01:59
OF THE REGIONAL CORRIDORS 

[Captioner] 20:01:59
THROUGH FREMONT.

[Captioner] 20:02:02
LIKE I SAID, INCLUDING MAJOR 

[Captioner] 20:02:06
PORTION OF PASEO PADRE, FREMONT 

[Captioner] 20:02:08
BOULEVARD, ACTUALLY THE ENTIRE 

[Captioner] 20:02:10
LENGTH OF FREMONT BOULEVARD IS 

[Captioner] 20:02:11
NOW UNDER COORDINATION, THE BULK 

[Captioner] 20:02:13
OF STEVENSON, MOWRY, WE'RE 

[Captioner] 20:02:18
CURRENTLY WORKING ON THORNTON,

[Captioner] 20:02:21
 DECOTO, AS WELL AS AUTOMALL 

[Captioner] 20:02:22
PARKWAY AS WELL, THAT'S A BIG 

[Captioner] 20:02:25
ONE, AND ALSO WARM SPRINGS 

[Captioner] 20:02:25
BOULEVARD.

[Captioner] 20:02:26
>> Councilmember Cox: SO IT'S 

[Captioner] 20:02:27
THE MAIN ONES THAT --

[Captioner] 20:02:31
>> MR. HU:  IT'S REALLY THE MAIN 

[Captioner] 20:02:32
CORRIDORS THAT HAS A LOT OF 

[Captioner] 20:02:33
TRAFFIC SIGNALS THAT REALLY 

[Captioner] 20:02:35
BENEFITS FROM SIGNAL 

[Captioner] 20:02:37
COORDINATION, ESPECIALLY DENSE 

[Captioner] 20:02:39
SPACINGS OF THE SIGNAL SPACING 

[Captioner] 20:02:40
AS WELL, WASHINGTON BOULEVARD IS 

[Captioner] 20:02:40
ANOTHER EXAMPLE.

[Captioner] 20:02:43
WHEREAS RESIDENTIAL STREET, THAT 

[Captioner] 20:02:48
DOESN'T REALLY APPLY AND

[Captioner] 20:02:50
 CHECK -- SPRAL DICK OR FAR 

[Captioner] 20:02:51
STRETCHED TRAFFIC SIGNALS 

[Captioner] 20:02:52
WOULDN'T FEEL THE BENEFIT OF 

[Captioner] 20:02:52
THAT AS WELL.

[Captioner] 20:02:54
EVEN WITH SIGNAL COORDINATION, 

[Captioner] 20:02:55
THERE'S DRAWBACK ASSOCIATED WITH 

[Captioner] 20:02:55
IT.

[Captioner] 20:02:58
YOU GUYS PROBABLY KNOW THAT AS 

[Captioner] 20:02:59
WELL FROM LISTENING TO A PORTION 

[Captioner] 20:03:02
OF THE CONSTITUENTS, IS THAT 

[Captioner] 20:03:03
SIDE STREET TRAFFIC TEND TO WAIT 

[Captioner] 20:03:06
A LITTLE BIT LONGER, SO PART OF 

[Captioner] 20:03:09
OUR SELECTION OF COORDINATION 

[Captioner] 20:03:10
CORRIDOR IS REALLY TRYING TO 

[Captioner] 20:03:11
FIND THE RIGHT LOCATION SO IS 

[Captioner] 20:03:14
THAT IT BALANCES THE -- WE 

[Captioner] 20:03:15
ENSURE THAT THE POSITIVE ASPECT 

[Captioner] 20:03:18
OF IT FAR OUTWEIGHS THE DRAW 

[Captioner] 20:03:18
BACKS.

[Captioner] 20:03:20
I WAS GOING TO SAY, YOU KNOW, 

[Captioner] 20:03:23
PROS AND CONS, BUT WE WANT THE 

[Captioner] 20:03:26
BENEFIT REALLY TO BE FELT HERE 

[Captioner] 20:03:28
WITH VERY MINIMAL IMPACT 

[Captioner] 20:03:30
EXPERIENCE-WISE TO THE DRIVERS.

[Captioner] 20:03:34
SO YEAH, AGAIN, LONG ANSWER, BUT

[Captioner] 20:03:37
 HOPEFULLY THAT KIND OF EXPLAINS 

[Captioner] 20:03:37
THE --

[Captioner] 20:03:39
>> Councilmember Cox: I GET THE 

[Captioner] 20:03:40
GIST OF WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

[Captioner] 20:03:42
LET ME ASK ANOTHER DIFFERENT 

[Captioner] 20:03:42
QUESTION.

[Captioner] 20:03:46
WHEN YOU'RE DESIGNING LIKE THE 

[Captioner] 20:03:49
SCHOOL ZONE, HOW FAR OUT ARE YOU 

[Captioner] 20:03:51
GOING FROM THE ACTUAL, I GUESS, 

[Captioner] 20:03:54
SCHOOL AND THEN YOU HAVE THE 

[Captioner] 20:03:55
VISION ZERO WITH ALL THE 

[Captioner] 20:03:57
IMPROVEMENTS THAT ARE BUILT FOR 

[Captioner] 20:04:00
SAFETY, BUT HOW FAR ARE YOU 

[Captioner] 20:04:02
LOOKING OUT IN THAT SCHOOL ZONE 

[Captioner] 20:04:03
WHEN YOU'RE DEFINING IT?

[Captioner] 20:04:08
>> Mr. Larsen: IN TERMS OF KIND 

[Captioner] 20:04:10
OF THE SAFE ROUTES TO SCHOOL 

[Captioner] 20:04:11
PROGRAM, I THINK THAT'S WHAT 

[Captioner] 20:04:11
YOU'RE REFERRING TO?

[Captioner] 20:04:13
>> Councilmember Cox: IF I HAVE 

[Captioner] 20:04:14
THE SCHOOL AND AS YOU HAVE SOME 

[Captioner] 20:04:16
OF THE STREETS IDENTIFIED, THEN 

[Captioner] 20:04:18
I'M LIKE THINKING OKAY, IF I 

[Captioner] 20:04:20
WALK ACROSS THE STREET, YOU GOT 

[Captioner] 20:04:22
THE CROSSWALK, BUT THEN HOW FAR 

[Captioner] 20:04:26
OUT DO YOU DESIGNATE AS THE 

[Captioner] 20:04:28
COVERED SAFE AREA FOR SCHOOL 

[Captioner] 20:04:29
ZONE, JUST SO I CAN KIND OF 

[Captioner] 20:04:31
UNDERSTAND THAT ASPECT PER THIS 

[Captioner] 20:04:33
REPORT WHEN THEY TALK ABOUT 

[Captioner] 20:04:34
SCHOOL ZONE?

[Captioner] 20:04:38
>> Mr. Larsen: YEAH, I THINK 

[Captioner] 20:04:39
THAT'S -- IT'S A LITTLE BIT 

[Captioner] 20:04:41
RELATED BUT KIND OF MORE OF A 

[Captioner] 20:04:43
SEPARATE TOPIC, SO IT'S KIND OF 

[Captioner] 20:04:44
TWO ANSWERS THERE.

[Captioner] 20:04:46
THE PAST WORK WE'VE DONE IN 

[Captioner] 20:04:50
WORKING WITH EACH INDIVIDUAL

[Captioner] 20:04:52
 SCHOOL, WE LOOK AT THE 

[Captioner] 20:04:53
BOUNDARIES OF THE SCHOOL AND 

[Captioner] 20:04:56
THEN IDENTIFY A SERIES OF SAFE 

[Captioner] 20:04:58
ROUTES TO THE SCHOOL WITHIN THE 

[Captioner] 20:04:58
SCHOOL BOUNDARIES.

[Captioner] 20:05:01
SO IT CERTAINLY INCLUDES A 

[Captioner] 20:05:03
QUARTER MILE RADIUS AND 

[Captioner] 20:05:06
SOMETIMES EXTENDS BEYOND THAT.

[Captioner] 20:05:09
SO THAT'S THE WORK WE'VE DONE IN 

[Captioner] 20:05:09
THE PAST.

[Captioner] 20:05:10
THAT IS CURRENTLY BEING UPDATED 

[Captioner] 20:05:12
AS PART OF OUR ACTIVE 

[Captioner] 20:05:16
TRANSPORTATION PLAN, WHERE WE'RE 

[Captioner] 20:05:18
RE-LOOKING AT THE SAFE ACCESS TO 

[Captioner] 20:05:23
SCHOOL PLANS, WORKING WITH THE 

[Captioner] 20:05:24
COMMUNITY TO HEAR WHERE THERE'S 

[Captioner] 20:05:26
ANY CONCERNS OR ISSUES, YOU 

[Captioner] 20:05:27
KNOW, STILL LEFT TO BE 

[Captioner] 20:05:28
ADDRESSED, AND THAT WILL BE PART 

[Captioner] 20:05:31
OF THE UPDATED ACTIVE 

[Captioner] 20:05:31
TRANSPORTATION PLAN WHICH WILL 

[Captioner] 20:05:33
BE COMING CITY COUNCIL LATER 

[Captioner] 20:05:34
THIS YEAR.

[Captioner] 20:05:35
>> Councilmember Cox: IT'S JUST 

[Captioner] 20:05:37
THAT IN THE REPORT, IN THE 

[Captioner] 20:05:38
SURVEY, THEY HAD TALKED ABOUT 

[Captioner] 20:05:39
SOME SORT OF SCHOOL ZONING AND 

[Captioner] 20:05:40
THAT'S WHERE I WAS JUST TRYING 

[Captioner] 20:05:42
TO UNDERSTAND THAT ASPECT OF IT 

[Captioner] 20:05:44
AND HOW DOES THAT CORRELATE WITH 

[Captioner] 20:05:46
YOUR LIST OF 30, AND SOME OF 

[Captioner] 20:05:51
THEM ARE NOT NECESSARILY DOWN

[Captioner] 20:05:52
 THE STREET LIKE ON THE SCHOOL 

[Captioner] 20:05:54
LIST BUT JUST KIND OF 

[Captioner] 20:05:56
UNDERSTANDING THAT WHAT WAS THE 

[Captioner] 20:05:59
SAFE ZONE ESTABLISHED FOR 

[Captioner] 20:06:01
INCLUDING AS PART OF THE SPEED 

[Captioner] 20:06:02
LIMITS FEEDING INTO THESE 

[Captioner] 20:06:02
DIFFERENT STREETS.

[Captioner] 20:06:07
>> Mr. Larsen: THAT IS WITHIN 

[Captioner] 20:06:09
THESE MAJOR STREET CORRIDORS, 

[Captioner] 20:06:11
THAT IF THERE IS A SCHOOL WITHIN 

[Captioner] 20:06:14
THAT AT THAT CORRIDOR OR NEARBY, 

[Captioner] 20:06:16
THAT CAN BE A JUSTIFICATION FOR 

[Captioner] 20:06:20
LOWERING THE SPEED LIMIT FIVE 

[Captioner] 20:06:23
MILES AN HOUR LOWER THAN WHAT 

[Captioner] 20:06:25
THE SURVEY RESULTS INDICATED AS 

[Captioner] 20:06:26
THE 85TH PERCENTILE RANGE.

[Captioner] 20:06:29
SO THAT'S A JUSTIFICATION FOR 

[Captioner] 20:06:31
LOWERING THE SPEED LIMIT BECAUSE 

[Captioner] 20:06:34
OF THE PRESENCE OF THE SCHOOL.

[Captioner] 20:06:37
SO WHERE THERE'S OPPORTUNITIES 

[Captioner] 20:06:39
FOR US TO DO THAT, THAT IS SORT 

[Captioner] 20:06:40
OF BAKED INTO THE RECOMMENDATION 

[Captioner] 20:06:41
THAT WE HAVE BEFORE YOU.

[Captioner] 20:06:43
>> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.

[Captioner] 20:06:45
BECAUSE THAT'S ALSO PART OF THAT 

[Captioner] 20:06:46
AB43 THAT'S ALSO REFERENCING TO 

[Captioner] 20:06:47
GIVE YOU THAT EXCEPTION.

[Captioner] 20:06:48
>> Mr. Larsen: RIGHT.

[Captioner] 20:06:49
>> Councilmember Cox: ONE OTHER 

[Captioner] 20:06:51
QUESTION IS, NOW WE'RE CHANGING 

[Captioner] 20:06:53
THE PROCESS OF CHANGING THE 

[Captioner] 20:06:54
SPEED LIMITS.

[Captioner] 20:06:57
DOES THAT CREATE A SPEED TRAP 

[Captioner] 20:07:00
FOR RESIDENTS THAT MIGHT DRIVE 

[Captioner] 20:07:03
THROUGH, WOULD THEY GET FINED IF 

[Captioner] 20:07:04
THEY'RE STILL GOING AT THE OLD 

[Captioner] 20:07:04
SPEED?

[Captioner] 20:07:06
I MEAN, I KNOW THIS IS NOT 

[Captioner] 20:07:07
FORMALLY APPROVED BECAUSE WE'VE 

[Captioner] 20:07:09
GOT A SECOND PUBLIC HEARING, 

[Captioner] 20:07:12
BUT, YOU KNOW, IT KIND OF READS 

[Captioner] 20:07:15
SOME THINGS OF A SPEED TRAP THAT 

[Captioner] 20:07:16
PROBABLY SOME OF OUR RESIDENTS 

[Captioner] 20:07:17
THAT HAVE COMMUNICATED WITH ME 

[Captioner] 20:07:19
HAVE ASKED ME SOME QUESTIONS 

[Captioner] 20:07:20
REGARDING THAT, SO WANTED TO 

[Captioner] 20:07:23
KIND OF REST ASSURE THEM, IS 

[Captioner] 20:07:26
THERE SOME MERCY, AND THEN, YOU 

[Captioner] 20:07:28
KNOW, NOT HAVING THAT GET 

[Captioner] 20:07:29
CONFUSED WITH THE TIME WHEN 

[Captioner] 20:07:32
THEY'RE ON THE STREET.

[Captioner] 20:07:34
>> Mr. Larsen: YEAH, SO THERE'S 

[Captioner] 20:07:36
A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT PREVENT 

[Captioner] 20:07:38
SORT OF THIS BEING A SPEED TRAP 

[Captioner] 20:07:41
OR PEOPLE BEING SURPRISED THAT 

[Captioner] 20:07:42
THERE'S A CHANGE IN THE SPEED 

[Captioner] 20:07:42
LIMIT.

[Captioner] 20:07:47
SO BEFORE THIS CAN BE ENFORCED, 

[Captioner] 20:07:48
THE SIGNS ON THE STREET HAVE TO 

[Captioner] 20:07:53
BE CHANGED SO THAT IT ISN'T JUST

[Captioner] 20:07:55
 COUNCIL'S ACTION THAT CHANGES 

[Captioner] 20:07:58
IT BUT THE POSTED SPEED LIMIT 

[Captioner] 20:07:59
AND THE SIGNS THAT ARE OUT THERE 

[Captioner] 20:08:01
ACTUALLY HAVE TO BE CHANGED AS 

[Captioner] 20:08:01
WELL.

[Captioner] 20:08:03
THERE'S LANGUAGE IN THE 

[Captioner] 20:08:05
LEGISLATION, AND I'M NOT SURE I 

[Captioner] 20:08:06
REMEMBER IT, YOU KNOW, IN THE 

[Captioner] 20:08:10
FULL DETAIL, BUT ESSENTIALLY IF 

[Captioner] 20:08:14
SOMEBODY GETS A TICKET FOR 

[Captioner] 20:08:17
SPEEDING LESS THAN 10 MILES AN 

[Captioner] 20:08:21
HOUR OVER THE OLD SPEED

[Captioner] 20:08:23
 LIMIT, THERE'S A KIND OF A 

[Captioner] 20:08:23
GRACE PERIOD THAT'S PROVIDED.

[Captioner] 20:08:26
 ASSOCIATED WITH THAT.

[Captioner] 20:08:28
I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S A MONTH OR 

[Captioner] 20:08:29
THREE MONTHS OR SOMETHING LIKE 

[Captioner] 20:08:29
THAT.

[Captioner] 20:08:33
BUT THERE'S -- SO IF YOU'RE 

[Captioner] 20:08:37
GOING -- SAY THE SPEED LIMIT WAS 

[Captioner] 20:08:39
35 AND IT'S -- WELL, IT'S 

[Captioner] 20:08:40
PROBABLY -- LET'S SAY IT WAS 40 

[Captioner] 20:08:44
AND IT'S GONE DOWN TO 35, IF

[Captioner] 20:08:46
 YOU'RE GOING 44, WHICH WOULD 

[Captioner] 20:08:48
HAVE JUST BEEN LIKE 4 OVER THE 

[Captioner] 20:08:50
OLD LIMIT BUT IT'S NOW 9, 

[Captioner] 20:08:53
THERE'S A GRACE PERIOD FOR THOSE 

[Captioner] 20:08:56
TYPES OF TICKETS, BUT IF YOU'RE 

[Captioner] 20:08:58
GOING MORE THAN 10 OVER, I MEAN, 

[Captioner] 20:09:00
YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN WAY OVER 

[Captioner] 20:09:01
UNDER THE OLD LIMIT.

[Captioner] 20:09:02
SO THERE'S SOME PROVISIONS 

[Captioner] 20:09:03
WITHIN THE STATE LAW THAT 

[Captioner] 20:09:05
PROVIDE A GRACE PERIOD TO 

[Captioner] 20:09:08
ACCOUNT FOR THE CHANGE.

[Captioner] 20:09:08
>> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.

[Captioner] 20:09:09
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

[Captioner] 20:09:15
>> Mayor Mei: CLARIFYING 

[Captioner] 20:09:16
QUESTIONS, COUNCILMEMBER 

[Captioner] 20:09:16
CAMPBELL.

[Captioner] 20:09:22
>> Councilmember Campbell: 

[Captioner] 20:09:24
ACTUALLY I THINK MY QUESTION WAS 

[Captioner] 20:09:26
ANSWERED ABOUT THE POSTED SPEED 

[Captioner] 20:09:26
SIGNS.

[Captioner] 20:09:28
NOW, THERE'S SOME PARTS OF THE 

[Captioner] 20:09:30
CITY WHERE THE -- AND ONE OF 

[Captioner] 20:09:32
THEM IN PARTICULAR THAT I 

[Captioner] 20:09:33
REMEMBER, BECAUSE I WAS JUST 

[Captioner] 20:09:34
OVER THERE THE OTHER DAY AND I 

[Captioner] 20:09:36
WAS LOOKING TO SEE WHAT THE 

[Captioner] 20:09:38
SPEED LIMIT WAS AND I COULDN'T 

[Captioner] 20:09:41
FIND IT, WAS BLACOW BOULEVARD 

[Captioner] 20:09:42
BETWEEN -- FREMONT BOULEVARD 

[Captioner] 20:09:44
BETWEEN BLACOW AND AUTOMALL.

[Captioner] 20:09:46
HEADING SOUTH.

[Captioner] 20:09:51
THERE'S NO POSTED SPEED SIGNS 

[Captioner] 20:09:54
THERE, AND SO I'M WONDERING, IS 

[Captioner] 20:09:57
THERE -- DO WE HAVE ANY 

[Captioner] 20:10:00
STANDARDS BY WHICH WE PUT SPEED 

[Captioner] 20:10:00
SIGNS?

[Captioner] 20:10:05
ARE THEY 10 FEET APART FROM ONE 

[Captioner] 20:10:06
ANOTHER OR 25 FEET APART FROM 

[Captioner] 20:10:07
ONE ANOTHER?

[Captioner] 20:10:09
BECAUSE I DIDN'T SEE ONE.

[Captioner] 20:10:12
AT ALL DOWN THAT STRETCH.

[Captioner] 20:10:14
>> Mr. Larsen: WE COULD TAKE A 

[Captioner] 20:10:16
LOOK AT THAT LIMIT TO SEE IF IT 

[Captioner] 20:10:18
MEETS THE STANDARDS FOR POSTING 

[Captioner] 20:10:19
SPEED LIMIT SIGNS.

[Captioner] 20:10:22
BUT THERE ARE STATE STANDARDS, 

[Captioner] 20:10:24
NATIONAL STANDARDS ON 

[Captioner] 20:10:26
COMMUNICATING WHAT THE SPEED 

[Captioner] 20:10:27
LIMITS ARE.

[Captioner] 20:10:28
ERIC, DO YOU KNOW?

[Captioner] 20:10:29
>> Councilmember Campbell: I'M 

[Captioner] 20:10:30
SORRY, YOU JUST SAID SOMETHING 

[Captioner] 20:10:32
THAT WAS INTERESTING.

[Captioner] 20:10:33
SO ARE YOU SUGGESTING THAT IN 

[Captioner] 20:10:36
SOME PARTS OF THE CITY, EVEN IF 

[Captioner] 20:10:39
THE SPEED LIMIT SIGNS ARE NOT 

[Captioner] 20:10:41
NECESSARILY REQUIRED TO BE 

[Captioner] 20:10:41
POSTED?

[Captioner] 20:10:47
>> Mr. Larsen: THAT WOULD ONLY 

[Captioner] 20:10:49
BE IN LIKE A RESIDENTIAL ZONE 

[Captioner] 20:10:50
WHERE, UNDER STATE LAW, IT'S 

[Captioner] 20:10:53
AUTOMATICALLY ESTABLISHED AS A 

[Captioner] 20:10:55
-- AS THE SPEED LIMIT WITHIN A 

[Captioner] 20:10:56
RESIDENTIAL AREA.

[Captioner] 20:11:00
SO OUTSIDE OF THAT, THEN

[Captioner] 20:11:02
 THE SPEED LIMIT GETS 

[Captioner] 20:11:03
ESTABLISHED THROUGH THIS PROCESS 

[Captioner] 20:11:04
THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE, 

[Captioner] 20:11:06
AND THERE'S A REQUIREMENT, ANY 

[Captioner] 20:11:08
TIME THE SPEED LIMIT CHANGES ON 

[Captioner] 20:11:09
A STREET, A SIGN NEEDS TO BE 

[Captioner] 20:11:13
POSTED AT THE BEGINNING OF THAT 

[Captioner] 20:11:16
CHANGE, BUT THEN THROUGHOUT THE 

[Captioner] 20:11:17
CORRIDOR, I BELIEVE, ERIC, YOU 

[Captioner] 20:11:19
MAY BE ABLE TO EXPAND ON IT, 

[Captioner] 20:11:22
THERE'S A CERTAIN LEVEL OF 

[Captioner] 20:11:23
SPACING THAT SPEED LIMIT SIGNS 

[Captioner] 20:11:25
NEED TO BE PLACED SO THAT 

[Captioner] 20:11:25
THERE'S CLEAR COMMUNICATION.

[Captioner] 20:11:30
>> MR. HU:  GENERALLY, LIKE HANS 

[Captioner] 20:11:31
SAID, IF YOU'RE TRAVELING ALONG 

[Captioner] 20:11:33
A PARTICULAR CORRIDOR, IF A 

[Captioner] 20:11:34
SPEED LIMIT CHANGES, OBVIOUSLY 

[Captioner] 20:11:36
AT THE LIMIT OF THE CHANGE, 

[Captioner] 20:11:38
THERE SHOULD BE A SPEED LIMIT 

[Captioner] 20:11:39
SIGN TO INDICATE THAT CHANGE.

[Captioner] 20:11:44
HOWEVER, AT MAJOR INTERSECTIONS 

[Captioner] 20:11:47
AS WELL WHERE, LET'S SAY, 

[Captioner] 20:11:48
SOMEONE, FOR EXAMPLE, ON 

[Captioner] 20:11:49
AUTOMALL PARKWAY IS TO MAKE A 

[Captioner] 20:11:51
RIGHT OR LEFT TURN ON TO FREMONT 

[Captioner] 20:11:53
BOULEVARD, FOR EXAMPLE, FROM 

[Captioner] 20:11:55
THAT PERSPECTIVE, THERE'S ALSO 

[Captioner] 20:11:56
FOR THEM, THE DRIVER, A SPEED 

[Captioner] 20:11:57
LIMIT CHANGE BECAUSE THE SPEED 

[Captioner] 20:12:00
LIMIT ON AUTOMALL PARKWAY 

[Captioner] 20:12:01
OBVIOUSLY TENDS TO BE FASTER 

[Captioner] 20:12:03
THAN THAT OF FREMONT BOULEVARD, 

[Captioner] 20:12:04
SO ON BOTH DOWNSTREAM SIDE IN 

[Captioner] 20:12:06
THIS CASE, WE WOULD ALSO 

[Captioner] 20:12:08
GENERALLY POST A SPEED LIMIT 

[Captioner] 20:12:12
SIGN AS WELL, JUST ANTICIPATING

[Captioner] 20:12:13
 THAT USER EXPERIENCE, I GUESS 

[Captioner] 20:12:17
YOU CAN SAY, SO THAT THEY'RE

[Captioner] 20:12:19
 ALSO ADEQUATELY INFORMED.

[Captioner] 20:12:19
>> Councilmember Campbell: SO 

[Captioner] 20:12:21
FOR LONG CORRIDORS LIKE THAT 

[Captioner] 20:12:23
AUTOMALL -- I MEAN THAT FREMONT 

[Captioner] 20:12:25
BOULEVARD FROM BLACOW ALL THE 

[Captioner] 20:12:27
WAY DOWN TO AUTOMALL, BOTH NORTH 

[Captioner] 20:12:31
AND SOUTH, IS THERE A DISTANCE 

[Captioner] 20:12:34
BY WHICH THE SPEED SIGN SHOULD 

[Captioner] 20:12:34
BE?

[Captioner] 20:12:37
SHOULD IT BE 25 FEET APART OR 30 

[Captioner] 20:12:37
FEET APART?

[Captioner] 20:12:39
BECAUSE AGAIN, I DIDN'T SEE ONE 

[Captioner] 20:12:40
AT ALL.

[Captioner] 20:12:43
I HAD -- MANY, MANY YEARS AGO, 

[Captioner] 20:12:44
THERE WAS ONE THERE, BUT IT 

[Captioner] 20:12:46
HASN'T BEEN THERE FOR QUITE A 

[Captioner] 20:12:48
WHILE NOW, SINCE I STARTED 

[Captioner] 20:12:50
READING ABOUT SPEED LIMIT 

[Captioner] 20:12:50
SIGNS.

[Captioner] 20:12:54
SO IS THERE A REQUIREMENT THAT 

[Captioner] 20:12:56
THERE'S SOME DISTANCE BETWEEN 

[Captioner] 20:12:57
THEM ON THOSE LONG CORRIDORS 

[Captioner] 20:12:57
LIKE THAT?

[Captioner] 20:13:01
>> THERE'S TECHNICALLY NO

[Captioner] 20:13:04
 SPACING REQUIREMENT.

[Captioner] 20:13:06
USUALLY THE SPACING IS DICTATED 

[Captioner] 20:13:08
BY THE MAJOR INTERSECTION 

[Captioner] 20:13:09
SPACINGS, USUALLY TEND TO BE 

[Captioner] 20:13:10
AROUND QUARTER OF A MILE, HALF A 

[Captioner] 20:13:13
MILE, JUST NATURALLY WHERE MAJOR 

[Captioner] 20:13:14
INTERSECTIONS ARE SPACED APART.

[Captioner] 20:13:19
IN THIS CASE, AS PART OF THE

[Captioner] 20:13:23
 FOLLOW-UP ACTION AFTER THE 

[Captioner] 20:13:28
SECOND READING, IT'S BEEN 

[Captioner] 20:13:28
APPROVED, PART OF OUR TEAM 

[Captioner] 20:13:30
EFFORT IS TO IDENTIFY OR 

[Captioner] 20:13:32
RE-ASSESS THE LOCATIONS OF ALL 

[Captioner] 20:13:35
THE PREVIOUS SIGNS THAT IN 

[Captioner] 20:13:36
THEORY SHOULD STILL BE IN 

[Captioner] 20:13:36
PLACE.

[Captioner] 20:13:39
IT'S VERY LIKELY THAT SOME OF 

[Captioner] 20:13:40
THE SIGNS COULD BE KNOCKED DOWN 

[Captioner] 20:13:42
AND NOT REPLACED FOR ALL WE 

[Captioner] 20:13:44
KNOW, SO WE'RE TAKING A 

[Captioner] 20:13:47
COMPREHENSIVE LOOK AT ALL THE 

[Captioner] 20:13:50
EXISTING SIGN LOCATIONS AND ALSO 

[Captioner] 20:13:51
EVALUATING WHETHER OR NOT SOME 

[Captioner] 20:13:52
OF THOSE SIGN LOCATIONS NEED TO 

[Captioner] 20:13:52
BE ADJUSTED.

[Captioner] 20:13:54
BECAUSE WE DID KNOW THAT SOME OF 

[Captioner] 20:13:56
THE SIGNS HAVE ALSO BEEN BLOCKED 

[Captioner] 20:14:00
BY FOLIAGE, TREES THAT PROBABLY 

[Captioner] 20:14:01
DIDN'T EXIST OR WERE MUCH 

[Captioner] 20:14:02
SMALLER BACK IN THE DAY, SO 

[Captioner] 20:14:04
WE'RE TAKING A COMPREHENSIVE 

[Captioner] 20:14:05
LOOK AT ALL OF THIS AS PART OF 

[Captioner] 20:14:06
THE EXERCISE.

[Captioner] 20:14:06
>> Councilmember Campbell: IS 

[Captioner] 20:14:08
THERE ANYTHING IN THE 

[Captioner] 20:14:10
LEGISLATURE ABOUT 15-MILE AN 

[Captioner] 20:14:10
HOUR ZONES?

[Captioner] 20:14:12
I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING ABOUT 

[Captioner] 20:14:18
15-MILE AN HOUR -- 15 MILES PER 

[Captioner] 20:14:19
HOUR ZONES IN THE CITY.

[Captioner] 20:14:27
>> Mr. Larsen: THERE IS SOME 

[Captioner] 20:14:28
ABILITY AND AN INCREASED ABILITY 

[Captioner] 20:14:31
IN THE NEW LEGISLATION TO HAVE 

[Captioner] 20:14:32
LOWER THAN 25-MILE AN HOUR SPEED 

[Captioner] 20:14:32
LIMITS.

[Captioner] 20:14:38
SO 20 OR 15 CAN BE USED.

[Captioner] 20:14:45
SO THAT'S PART OF THIS

[Captioner] 20:14:47
 REPORT THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT.

[Captioner] 20:14:49
AS WE LOOK AT THE DATA ACROSS 

[Captioner] 20:14:53
THE CITY WHERE WE HAVE SAFETY 

[Captioner] 20:14:54
ISSUES, THEY'RE GENERALLY MORE 

[Captioner] 20:14:55
ON THE MAJOR STREETS THAN THEY 

[Captioner] 20:14:55
ARE IN NEIGHBORHOODS.

[Captioner] 20:15:02
BUT THE IDEA OR POTENTIAL TO GO 

[Captioner] 20:15:05
DOWN FURTHER TO 25 MILES AN HOUR 

[Captioner] 20:15:07
IS A SORT OF A POLICY QUESTION 

[Captioner] 20:15:09
THAT THE COUNCIL COULD CONSIDER 

[Captioner] 20:15:10
AND MAY BE COMING UP AS A PART 

[Captioner] 20:15:15
OF THE CONTEXT OF THE ACTIVE

[Captioner] 20:15:16
 TRANSPORTATION PLAN.

[Captioner] 20:15:18
IF WE HEAR PEOPLE IN 

[Captioner] 20:15:20
NEIGHBORHOODS THAT WANT TO GO TO 

[Captioner] 20:15:22
THEIR SCHOOL OR PARKS ARE 

[Captioner] 20:15:23
CONCERNED WITH SPEEDING AT THE 

[Captioner] 20:15:25
25-MILE AN HOUR LIMIT AND WANT 

[Captioner] 20:15:27
TO, YOU KNOW, BE ABLE TO PUSH 

[Captioner] 20:15:29
SOMETHING MORE, I DON'T KNOW 

[Captioner] 20:15:30
THAT WE'RE REALLY HEARING THAT 

[Captioner] 20:15:32
TOO MUCH.

[Captioner] 20:15:39
WHAT WE'VE SEEN PROFESSIONALLY 

[Captioner] 20:15:41
IS THERE'S SORT OF MORE BENEFIT 

[Captioner] 20:15:45
IN MANAGING THE UPPER END SPEED 

[Captioner] 20:15:47
LIMITS ON THE MAJOR STREETS THAN 

[Captioner] 20:15:48
THERE IS TO PUSH EVEN LOWER 

[Captioner] 20:15:49
SPEEDS OUT IN THE 

[Captioner] 20:15:49
NEIGHBORHOODS.

[Captioner] 20:15:55
BUT THAT IS AN ABILITY THAT'S 

[Captioner] 20:15:57
OUT THERE UNDER STATE LAW, IS TO 

[Captioner] 20:15:57
GO LESS THAN 25.

[Captioner] 20:15:58
>> Councilmember Campbell: 

[Captioner] 20:16:00
PARTICULARLY AROUND SCHOOLS, 

[Captioner] 20:16:04
THAT WOULD BE THE IDEAL PLACE TO

[Captioner] 20:16:05
 LOOK AT LOWERING THE SPEED 

[Captioner] 20:16:05
LIMITS.

[Captioner] 20:16:10
NOW WE HAVE THOSE NEW

[Captioner] 20:16:13
 SIGNS THAT SAYS SPEED LIMIT IS 

[Captioner] 20:16:16
25 OR 35 OR WHATEVER, AND YOU'RE 

[Captioner] 20:16:16
GOING 40.

[Captioner] 20:16:19
ARE WE -- WILL THOSE BE UPDATED 

[Captioner] 20:16:22
ONCE THIS IS APPROVED, IF IT'S 

[Captioner] 20:16:24
APPROVED, THOSE WILL BE UPDATED 

[Captioner] 20:16:24
AS WELL?

[Captioner] 20:16:25
OKAY.

[Captioner] 20:16:30
AND THEN -- I DON'T THINK I HAVE 

[Captioner] 20:16:31
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS RIGHT NOW.

[Captioner] 20:16:33
THANK YOU FOR ANSWERING MY 

[Captioner] 20:16:33
QUESTIONS BEFOREHAND AS WELL.

[Captioner] 20:16:34
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 20:16:35
WE HAVE TWO SPEAKER CARDS, I 

[Captioner] 20:16:35
BELIEVE.

[Captioner] 20:16:37
SO COULD WE CALL THE SPEAKERS 

[Captioner] 20:16:39
FOR THIS ITEM?

[Captioner] 20:16:45
>> Ms. Gauthier: HOW MANY 

[Captioner] 20:16:46
MINUTES?

[Captioner] 20:16:47
>> Mayor Mei: ONE MINUTE EACH.

[Captioner] 20:16:50
WE'LL KEEP IT CONSISTENT.

[Captioner] 20:16:52
>> Ms. Gauthier: NARIN FOLLOWED 

[Captioner] 20:16:53
BY KELLY ABREU.

[Captioner] 20:16:55
>> Mayor Mei: WELCOME, NARIN.

[Captioner] 20:17:05
>> HI.

[Captioner] 20:17:06
GOOD EVENING, EVERYONE.

[Captioner] 20:17:09
SO THERE ARE LIKE 168 STREETS 

[Captioner] 20:17:10
THAT WERE CURRENTLY BEING 

[Captioner] 20:17:13
SURVEYED AND OUT OF IT, 30 WERE 

[Captioner] 20:17:14
PROPOSED TO REDUCE THE SPEED 

[Captioner] 20:17:16
LIMIT SO THAT LEAVES LIKE 138 

[Captioner] 20:17:17
STREETS WHICH WE ARE NOT 

[Captioner] 20:17:19
TOUCHING, BUT IF WE'RE ACTUALLY 

[Captioner] 20:17:21
LOOKING AT THE DATA, THERE ARE 

[Captioner] 20:17:23
ALMOST LIKE 60 TO 70 STREETS FOR 

[Captioner] 20:17:24
WHICH LIKE 85 PERCENTILE IS MORE 

[Captioner] 20:17:26
THAN WHAT IS CURRENT SPEED LIMIT 

[Captioner] 20:17:28
OR IT'S OUTSIDE THE 10-MILE 

[Captioner] 20:17:28
RANGE.

[Captioner] 20:17:31
SO FOR ALL THOSE THINGS, ALL I'M 

[Captioner] 20:17:33
SAYING IS A GENERIC STATEMENT 

[Captioner] 20:17:37
THAT SAYS THESE ARE PROBABLY 

[Captioner] 20:17:38
HAVING MORE CRASH RATE OR THEY 

[Captioner] 20:17:42
HAVE PEDESTRIAN WALKWAYS OR 

[Captioner] 20:17:43
BIKEWAYS BUT SOME OF THOSE 

[Captioner] 20:17:44
THINGS I HAVE ACTUALLY LOOKED AT 

[Captioner] 20:17:46
IT AND THEY DON'T HAVE IT, SO IT 

[Captioner] 20:17:48
SEEMS LIKE NOT A ONE THING OUT 

[Captioner] 20:17:51
OF 70-PLUS IS DEEMED TO BE 

[Captioner] 20:17:52
CONSIDERED TO INCREASE THE SPEED 

[Captioner] 20:17:54
LIMIT LIKE EVERYTHING IS LIKE A 

[Captioner] 20:17:55
DECREASED SPEED LIMIT, AND 

[Captioner] 20:17:57
ANOTHER THING IS THE OLDEST 

[Captioner] 20:18:01
SURVEY THAT WAS DONE IS ON

[Captioner] 20:18:03
 APRIL 22ND --

[Captioner] 20:18:03
>> Ms. Gauthier: THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 20:18:04
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 20:18:06
WELCOME, KELLY.

[Captioner] 20:18:07
>> WHATEVER HAPPENED TO THAT 

[Captioner] 20:18:09
RULE THAT IF THERE ARE LESS THAN 

[Captioner] 20:18:11
SO MANY SPEAKERS, IT WAS 3 

[Captioner] 20:18:12
MINUTES PER SPEAKER, THEN TWO 

[Captioner] 20:18:13
MINUTES, NOW WE'RE DOING ONE 

[Captioner] 20:18:13
MINUTE?

[Captioner] 20:18:14
THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS.

[Captioner] 20:18:22
MR. HU SAID, OH, THIS REPORT, 

[Captioner] 20:18:23
THE SPEED REPORT IS ON FILE AT 

[Captioner] 20:18:25
THE CITY CLERK'S OFFICE DURING 

[Captioner] 20:18:25
NORMAL BUSINESS HOURS.

[Captioner] 20:18:27
I WENT THERE THIS MORNING, IT 

[Captioner] 20:18:27
WASN'T THERE.

[Captioner] 20:18:30
IT WASN'T THERE.

[Captioner] 20:18:34
LET'S TALK ABOUT STEVENSON 

[Captioner] 20:18:35
BOULEVARD WEST OF 880.

[Captioner] 20:18:38
YOU CLAIM TO BE SETTING SPEED 

[Captioner] 20:18:39
LIMITS WESTBOUND.

[Captioner] 20:18:42
DID YOU KNOW THAT ONLY THAT PART 

[Captioner] 20:18:42
OF THE STREET IS PAVED?

[Captioner] 20:18:43
YOU KNOW WHY?

[Captioner] 20:18:44
BECAUSE IT'S IN NEWARK.

[Captioner] 20:18:47
WHAT ARE YOU DOING SETTING SPEED 

[Captioner] 20:18:49
LIMITS IN THE CITY OF NEWARK 

[Captioner] 20:18:53
GOING WESTBOUND ON STEVENSON ALL 

[Captioner] 20:18:55
THE WAY TO THE END INTO THE 

[Captioner] 20:18:55
BAY?

[Captioner] 20:18:58
HOW CAN YOU HAVE AUTHORITY, AND 

[Captioner] 20:19:00
WHY ARE YOU EVEN RUNNING A SPEED 

[Captioner] 20:19:02
SURVEY IN NEWARK?

[Captioner] 20:19:05
AND I'VE GOT MORE, SO MUCH MORE, 

[Captioner] 20:19:05
BUT ONE MINUTE.

[Captioner] 20:19:12
>> Ms. Gauthier: THAT'S IT.

[Captioner] 20:19:12
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 20:19:15
PLEASE NOTE THAT IF YOU SEND IN 

[Captioner] 20:19:17
ANY COMMENTS, THEY ARE ACCEPTED 

[Captioner] 20:19:19
ALSO AND PART OF OUR PUBLIC 

[Captioner] 20:19:19
RECORDS.

[Captioner] 20:19:21
I'LL TURN THIS BACK TO THE 

[Captioner] 20:19:23
COUNCIL FOR ANY OTHER CLARIFYING 

[Captioner] 20:19:23
QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS.

[Captioner] 20:19:28
VICE MAYOR SHAO.

[Captioner] 20:19:29
>> Vice Mayor Shao: THANK YOU, 

[Captioner] 20:19:29
MADAME MAYOR.

[Captioner] 20:19:34
I JUST LOOKED THROUGH THE

[Captioner] 20:19:35
 WHOLE REPORT ESPECIALLY IN THE 

[Captioner] 20:19:39
JUSTIFICATION PART, AND I FOUND 

[Captioner] 20:19:43
THAT IT SEEMS THAT THE

[Captioner] 20:19:47
 SUGGESTED SPEEDING LIMIT IS

[Captioner] 20:19:51
 SYSTEMATICALLY 5 MILES PER HOUR 

[Captioner] 20:19:54
LOWER THAN THE CURRENT.

[Captioner] 20:19:57
YOU GO THROUGH ALL THOSE KIND OF 

[Captioner] 20:19:57
JUSTIFICATION.

[Captioner] 20:20:02
IF THE CURRENT 85% OR PERCENTILE

[Captioner] 20:20:07
 SPEED IS 5 MILES ABOVE THE

[Captioner] 20:20:10
 EXISTING SPEED LIMIT, THAT 

[Captioner] 20:20:12
NEUTRALIZED IT, OH, WE JUST 

[Captioner] 20:20:12
DON'T CHANGE.

[Captioner] 20:20:14
IF IT FITS THE CURRENT ONE, THEN 

[Captioner] 20:20:17
WE LOWER BY 5 MILES PER HOUR.

[Captioner] 20:20:22
AND YOU HAVE SO MANY FACTORS TO 

[Captioner] 20:20:26
JUSTIFY THE LOWERING DOWN 5 

[Captioner] 20:20:29
MILES PER HOUR IN MULTIPLE 

[Captioner] 20:20:29
CASES.

[Captioner] 20:20:31
IF IT FITS ONE OF THE 

[Captioner] 20:20:32
CONDITIONS, THEN IT'S 

[Captioner] 20:20:32
JUSTIFIED.

[Captioner] 20:20:35
FOR EXAMPLE, HIGHER COLLISION 

[Captioner] 20:20:36
RATE THAN EXPECTED.

[Captioner] 20:20:43
IF HIGHER -- IF IT'S BELOW

[Captioner] 20:20:48
 THE EXPECTED COLLISION RATE, OH 

[Captioner] 20:20:48
-- A SCHOOL, IT WILL FIT.

[Captioner] 20:20:50
IF THERE'S NO SCHOOL, OH, 

[Captioner] 20:20:52
THERE'S RESIDENTIAL HOUSES 

[Captioner] 20:20:57
FACING THE STREET, THEN,

[Captioner] 20:20:59
 OH, THERE ARE DRIVEWAY, SO YOU 

[Captioner] 20:21:01
HAVE TO LOWER DOWN.

[Captioner] 20:21:04
IF THAT DOESN'T EVEN FIT, THEN 

[Captioner] 20:21:08
YOU HAVE ONE JUSTIFICATION, NOT 

[Captioner] 20:21:10
YOU BUT THE CONSULTING COMPANY, 

[Captioner] 20:21:11
JUST FIGURE OF SPEECH.

[Captioner] 20:21:16
THEN IT SAYS, OH, THEN

[Captioner] 20:21:21
 BECAUSE IT IS -- YOU KNOW, THE

[Captioner] 20:21:23
 CURRENT 85 PERCENTILE SPEED IS 

[Captioner] 20:21:27
ABOVE THE PACE RANGE OF 10 

[Captioner] 20:21:28
MILES, THEN IT HAS TO COME 

[Captioner] 20:21:29
DOWN.

[Captioner] 20:21:33
SO IT SEEMS LIKE NO MATTER WHAT, 

[Captioner] 20:21:33
YOU ARE SLOWING DOWN.

[Captioner] 20:21:38
I UNDERSTAND THAT, YOU KNOW, THE

[Captioner] 20:21:43
 35 MILES PER HOUR SPEED WILL -- 

[Captioner] 20:21:45
OR LOWER WILL CAUSE LOW DAMAGE, 

[Captioner] 20:21:47
BUT IN THAT CASE, WHY NOT JUST 

[Captioner] 20:21:50
PUT A CEILING SPEED LIMIT LIKE 

[Captioner] 20:21:50
35 MILES PER HOUR?

[Captioner] 20:21:53
WE DON'T HAVE TO SPEND MONEY 

[Captioner] 20:21:55
DOING THE SURVEY, WE DON'T HAVE 

[Captioner] 20:21:56
TO DO ALL THE JUSTIFICATION.

[Captioner] 20:22:00
IT'S JUST YOU'LL BELIEVE THAT, 

[Captioner] 20:22:02
OKAY, AS LONG AS PEOPLE ARE 

[Captioner] 20:22:03
WORKING, THERE'S NO COLLISION AT 

[Captioner] 20:22:04
ALL BECAUSE THERE'S NO CAR.

[Captioner] 20:22:09
IF THERE'S CAR, IF PEOPLE ARE 

[Captioner] 20:22:13
DRIVING UNDER 35 MILES PER HOUR 

[Captioner] 20:22:18
ANYWAY, THEN OF COURSE IT WILL 

[Captioner] 20:22:20
-- SO FOR ME IT'S MORE OF LIKE A 

[Captioner] 20:22:25
-- JUST, YOU KNOW, SYSTEMATIC

[Captioner] 20:22:28
 PRESET CONDITION THAT TRUMPS 

[Captioner] 20:22:28
THE SURVEY.

[Captioner] 20:22:31
SO THE SURVEY ACTUALLY KOWN DOES 

[Captioner] 20:22:31
NOT MATTER ANYMORE.

[Captioner] 20:22:36
BECAUSE EVEN IF THE SURVEY 

[Captioner] 20:22:40
SUGGESTS OTHERWISE, THEN YOU 

[Captioner] 20:22:41
WOULD USE SOMETHING THAT SEEMS 

[Captioner] 20:22:43
TO ME IS REMOTELY REASONABLE.

[Captioner] 20:22:46
FOR EXAMPLE, I'LL GIVE YOU 

[Captioner] 20:22:50
EXAMPLE, FOR THE PASEO PADRE 

[Captioner] 20:22:55
BETWEEN THE DECOTO AND THE

[Captioner] 20:22:59
 THORNTON AREA, EVERYTHING SEEMS 

[Captioner] 20:23:02
TO BE INDICATING THAT YOU SHOULD 

[Captioner] 20:23:06
KEEP THE ORIGINAL SPEED LIMIT IF 

[Captioner] 20:23:09
NOT RAISING IT HIGHER.

[Captioner] 20:23:13
EVEN YOU ADMIT THAT THE 

[Captioner] 20:23:14
COLLISION RATE IS LOWER THAN 

[Captioner] 20:23:16
EXPECTED BUT THE ONLY REASON 

[Captioner] 20:23:17
THEY'RE BEING -- OH, IT'S CLOSE 

[Captioner] 20:23:18
TO BROOKVALE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

[Captioner] 20:23:21
I STUDIED THE MAP, AND IF YOU 

[Captioner] 20:23:24
LOOK AT THE MAP, THE BROOKVALE 

[Captioner] 20:23:25
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IS WELL 

[Captioner] 20:23:28
ISOLATED IN THAT NEIGHBORHOOD, 

[Captioner] 20:23:30
AND IT'S ACTUALLY AT LEAST ONE 

[Captioner] 20:23:33
BLOCK AWAY FROM THE PASEO PADRE 

[Captioner] 20:23:33
PARKWAY.

[Captioner] 20:23:38
AND SO FOR THAT ONE, I CAN SAY 

[Captioner] 20:23:40
-- IF THAT IS CALLED ADJACENT, 

[Captioner] 20:23:45
THEN WE HAVE 33 SCHOOLS

[Captioner] 20:23:47
 IN FREMONT THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE 

[Captioner] 20:23:47
NEIGHBORHOOD.

[Captioner] 20:23:50
THEN THIS MORE OR LESS WOULD 

[Captioner] 20:23:50
ALSO COUNT.

[Captioner] 20:23:54
SO FOR ME, I WONDER WHAT IS THE 

[Captioner] 20:23:59
STANDARD FOR THE ADJACENCY TO A

[Captioner] 20:24:01
 SCHOOL, YOU KNOW, USING THAT AS 

[Captioner] 20:24:02
AN EXAMPLE.

[Captioner] 20:24:04
AND ALSO I WANT TO SEE THAT IF 

[Captioner] 20:24:08
YOU LOOK DOWN THE PASEO PADRE 

[Captioner] 20:24:13
PARKWAY FROM DECOTO ALL THE WAY

[Captioner] 20:24:16
 DOWN, YOU WOULD SEE IN EACH AND 

[Captioner] 20:24:18
EVERY SECTION RIGHT NOW THE 85 

[Captioner] 20:24:20
PERCENTILE SPEED IS ABOUT 5 

[Captioner] 20:24:23
MILES OR EVEN HIGHER THAN THE 

[Captioner] 20:24:23
CURRENT ONE.

[Captioner] 20:24:28
SO BY SYSTEMATICALLY SLOWING 

[Captioner] 20:24:31
DOWN THE WHOLE PASEO PADRE 

[Captioner] 20:24:33
PARKWAY, YOU'RE BASICALLY, YOU 

[Captioner] 20:24:37
KNOW, SHUTTING DOWN ONE OF THE 

[Captioner] 20:24:38
ARTERIES, ARTERY ROADS, YOU 

[Captioner] 20:24:38
KNOW, IN FREMONT.

[Captioner] 20:24:42
FREMONT IS THE SECOND BIGGEST 

[Captioner] 20:24:44
CITY IN THE WHOLE BAY AREA.

[Captioner] 20:24:48
AND IT TAKES, YOU KNOW, FOREVER 

[Captioner] 20:24:50
TO GO FROM THE SOUTHERN PART TO 

[Captioner] 20:24:54
THE NORTHERN PART OR VICE VERSA 

[Captioner] 20:24:55
BECAUSE SOMETIMES WE 

[Captioner] 20:24:56
COUNCILMEMBERS HAVE TO GO FROM 

[Captioner] 20:25:00
ONE EVENT TO ANOTHER, AND WE'RE

[Captioner] 20:25:01
 STRUGGLING, EVEN TRAVELING 

[Captioner] 20:25:04
WITHIN THE CITY, WE SUFFER FROM 

[Captioner] 20:25:06
THE TRAFFIC, OR THE SPEED 

[Captioner] 20:25:06
LIMIT.

[Captioner] 20:25:12
SO IN THAT CASE, I AM VERY 

[Captioner] 20:25:15
CONCERNED ABOUT THE SUGGESTED 

[Captioner] 20:25:19
PLAN, AND I -- BEFORE I GET MORE 

[Captioner] 20:25:21
INFORMATION, FOR EXAMPLE, 

[Captioner] 20:25:23
REGARDING THE SO-CALLED EXPECTED 

[Captioner] 20:25:27
COLLISION RATE, IF THAT EXPECTED

[Captioner] 20:25:31
 COLLISION RATE IS TAKEN

[Captioner] 20:25:36
 BEFORE ALL THE VISION ZERO 

[Captioner] 20:25:37
MEASURES, OR AFTER YOU HAVE 

[Captioner] 20:25:40
ALREADY TAKEN THE MISSION ZERO 

[Captioner] 20:25:40
MEASURES.

[Captioner] 20:25:44
SO I JUST WANT TO SEE, YOU

[Captioner] 20:25:48
 KNOW, LIKE WHAT WE HAVE

[Captioner] 20:25:53
 DONE AND SPENT SO MUCH

[Captioner] 20:25:55
 MONEY TO SLOW PEOPLE DOWN, TO 

[Captioner] 20:25:59
MAKE MORE EFFORTS TO

[Captioner] 20:26:01
 MAKE RIGHT TURNS, ALL THE 

[Captioner] 20:26:02
NEGATIVE FEEDBACK FROM THE 

[Captioner] 20:26:02
COMMUNITY.

[Captioner] 20:26:07
WE WANT TO SEE IF, APART FROM

[Captioner] 20:26:09
 THIS, WHETHER THERE WAS ALREADY 

[Captioner] 20:26:11
A LOWERING DOWN OF THE COLLISION 

[Captioner] 20:26:11
RATE.

[Captioner] 20:26:14
IF THAT -- THAT HAS NOTHING TO 

[Captioner] 20:26:16
DO WITH THE COLLISION RATE, THEN 

[Captioner] 20:26:16
ALL WE HAVE DONE IS IN VAIN.

[Captioner] 20:26:20
BUT IF YOU WANT TO COMPARE THE 

[Captioner] 20:26:22
COLLISION RATE, THEN I JUST WANT 

[Captioner] 20:26:24
TO KNOW WHAT COLLISION RATE ARE 

[Captioner] 20:26:25
YOU COMPARING WITH?

[Captioner] 20:26:26
WHAT'S THE EXPECTED ONE?

[Captioner] 20:26:32
SO THAT IS MY BIGGEST CONCERN,

[Captioner] 20:26:36
 AND I BELIEVE IF I SIMPLY AGREE 

[Captioner] 20:26:39
WITH THIS AND I WILL SEE 

[Captioner] 20:26:42
BASICALLY THE SLOWING DOWN 

[Captioner] 20:26:43
SYSTEMATICALLY ALONG PASEO PADRE 

[Captioner] 20:26:44
PARKWAY.

[Captioner] 20:26:45
THAT'S MY CONCERN.

[Captioner] 20:26:53
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 20:26:54
QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS, 

[Captioner] 20:26:54
COUNCILMEMBER KENG.

[Captioner] 20:26:57
>> Councilmember Keng: THANK 

[Captioner] 20:26:58
YOU, MADAME MAYOR, AND THANK 

[Captioner] 20:27:01
YOU, STAFF, FOR THIS REPORT AND 

[Captioner] 20:27:01
RECOMMENDATIONS.

[Captioner] 20:27:04
CAN YOU CLARIFY, THERE'S TWO 

[Captioner] 20:27:05
THINGS IN PARTICULAR.

[Captioner] 20:27:11
ONE IS MR. ABREU'S QUESTION

[Captioner] 20:27:15
 REGARDING STEVENSON FROM 880 

[Captioner] 20:27:15
EASTBOUND.

[Captioner] 20:27:19
SO SHOULD WE

[Captioner] 20:27:21
 CORRECT THIS -- CURRENTLY IT 

[Captioner] 20:27:25
SAYS TO EASTERLY AND TO CITY 

[Captioner] 20:27:25
LIMIT.

[Captioner] 20:27:28
I BELIEVE THERE IS A SECTION OF 

[Captioner] 20:27:29
STEVENSON THAT IS STILL FREMONT, 

[Captioner] 20:27:31
BUT NOT UNTIL THE END OF 

[Captioner] 20:27:31
STEVENSON.

[Captioner] 20:27:36
AND -- BUT ANOTHER POINT, IF YOU 

[Captioner] 20:27:40
COULD SHARE, I THINK EARLIER 

[Captioner] 20:27:42
COUNCILMEMBER -- VICE MAYOR SHAO 

[Captioner] 20:27:46
WAS SAYING ABOUT WE ARE LOWERING 

[Captioner] 20:27:48
THE SPEED LIMIT OF THE ENTIRE 

[Captioner] 20:27:50
PASEO PADRE PARKWAY, WHICH I 

[Captioner] 20:27:52
DON'T THINK IS THE CASE FROM 

[Captioner] 20:27:52
THIS LIST.

[Captioner] 20:27:56
CURRENTLY I SEE ONLY FROM DECOTO 

[Captioner] 20:27:56
TO THORNTON.

[Captioner] 20:27:59
IS THAT THE CASE OR ARE WE 

[Captioner] 20:28:01
LOWERING THE SPEED LIMIT FOR THE 

[Captioner] 20:28:02
WHOLE PASEO PADRE PARKWAY?

[Captioner] 20:28:02
THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 20:28:10
>> Mr. Larsen: ERIC, CAN YOU 

[Captioner] 20:28:11
SPEAK TO STEVENSON?

[Captioner] 20:28:13
ACTUALLY BOTH QUESTIONS?

[Captioner] 20:28:15
>> MR. HU:  YEAH, WELL, FIRST OF 

[Captioner] 20:28:18
ALL REGARDING STEVENSON BETWEEN 

[Captioner] 20:28:21
-- WEST OF 880, BETWEEN 880 TO 

[Captioner] 20:28:23
THE WESTERN CITY LIMITS, YES, 

[Captioner] 20:28:25
THE EASTBOUND DIRECTION VEHICLE 

[Captioner] 20:28:27
LANES ARE WITHIN THE CITY OF 

[Captioner] 20:28:28
FREMONT JURISDICTION.

[Captioner] 20:28:31
THE WESTBOUND DIRECTION 

[Captioner] 20:28:32
TECHNICALLY IS WITHIN THE CITY 

[Captioner] 20:28:34
OF NEWARK JURISDICTION, AND 

[Captioner] 20:28:35
WE'VE ACTUALLY BEEN COORDINATING 

[Captioner] 20:28:38
WITH THE CITY OF NEWARK STAFF IN 

[Captioner] 20:28:41
THIS EFFORT BECAUSE UP TO THIS 

[Captioner] 20:28:44
POINT, INCLUDING THIS CYCLE, 

[Captioner] 20:28:45
THEY ARE ON THEIR OWN UPDATE 

[Captioner] 20:28:47
SCHEDULE, WE ARE ON OUR OWN 

[Captioner] 20:28:47
SCHEDULE.

[Captioner] 20:28:51
HOWEVER, FROM A COST 

[Captioner] 20:28:53
PERSPECTIVE, THE WAY THE 

[Captioner] 20:28:55
CONSULTANT PLACED THEIR CENSORS, 

[Captioner] 20:28:58
IT IS -- THERE'S NO IMPACT TO 

[Captioner] 20:28:59
THE OVERALL EFFORT OR COST TO 

[Captioner] 20:29:01
JUST GO AHEAD AND DO THE SURVEY 

[Captioner] 20:29:03
FOR BOTH DIRECTIONS WHILE THE 

[Captioner] 20:29:04
COUNTER IS OUT THERE, SO WE DO 

[Captioner] 20:29:07
COLLECT THE DATA FOR BOTH 

[Captioner] 20:29:07
DIRECTIONS.

[Captioner] 20:29:09
HOWEVER, OUR DECISION OR OUR 

[Captioner] 20:29:10
RECOMMENDATION IS BASED ON 

[Captioner] 20:29:12
OBVIOUSLY THE FREMONT PORTION OF 

[Captioner] 20:29:12
IT.

[Captioner] 20:29:14
BUT WE ARE IN COORDINATION 

[Captioner] 20:29:16
CURRENTLY WITH THE CITY OF 

[Captioner] 20:29:17
NEWARK STAFF TO SEE IF THEY WANT 

[Captioner] 20:29:20
TO USE THE DATA WE'VE ALREADY 

[Captioner] 20:29:21
COLLECTED AND FOLLOW UP WITH 

[Captioner] 20:29:24
THEIR OWN ACTION WITH THEIR 

[Captioner] 20:29:25
COUNCIL THROUGH THEIR PROCESS 

[Captioner] 20:29:29
TO, IN A WAY, MATCH THEIR

[Captioner] 20:29:31
 SEGMENT -- FOR THEIR SPEED 

[Captioner] 20:29:32
LIMIT AS WELL, SO THAT PROCESS 

[Captioner] 20:29:33
IS ONGOING.

[Captioner] 20:29:38
AND REGARDING PASEO PADRE

[Captioner] 20:29:43
 PARKWAY, ONE OF THE REASONING 

[Captioner] 20:29:46
FOR HAVING A CERTIFIED 

[Captioner] 20:29:48
ENGINEERING SPEED SURVEY TO 

[Captioner] 20:29:50
JUSTIFY POSTED SPEED LIMIT IS SO 

[Captioner] 20:29:53
THAT AGENCIES CANNOT JUST 

[Captioner] 20:29:54
UNILATERALLY MAKE A DECISION TO 

[Captioner] 20:29:57
JUST SAY LET'S SAY, FOR EXAMPLE, 

[Captioner] 20:29:59
PASEO PADRE SET THE WHOLE 

[Captioner] 20:30:01
CORRIDOR FOR 35 MILES AN HOUR 

[Captioner] 20:30:03
SPEED LIMIT, WE DO HAVE TO AT 

[Captioner] 20:30:05
LEAST -- BASED ON THE CURRENT 

[Captioner] 20:30:08
LEGISLATION AND EVEN AFTER AB43, 

[Captioner] 20:30:11
WE STILL HAVE TO BASE IT ON A 

[Captioner] 20:30:13
VALID ENGINEERING SURVEY, 

[Captioner] 20:30:14
OTHERWISE IT IS DEFINED AS A 

[Captioner] 20:30:18
SPEED TRAP, AND IT'S NO LONGER 

[Captioner] 20:30:18
ENFORCEABLE BARRE DAR.

[Captioner] 20:30:20
 BY RADAR.

[Captioner] 20:30:22
THAT'S KIND OF THE REASON WHY 

[Captioner] 20:30:24
WE'RE GOING THROUGH THIS 

[Captioner] 20:30:26
EXERCISE TO KIND OF UPDATE THE 

[Captioner] 20:30:27
SURVEY, BECAUSE OUR EXISTING 

[Captioner] 20:30:29
SURVEY FOR A NUMBER OF THESE 

[Captioner] 20:30:31
SEGMENTS HAVE -- YOU KNOW, ARE 

[Captioner] 20:30:34
BASICALLY EXPIRED, SO THAT WE 

[Captioner] 20:30:37
CAN PROVIDE OUR PD THE TOOL, THE 

[Captioner] 20:30:39
AUTHORITY TO CONTINUE TO ENFORCE 

[Captioner] 20:30:43
EVEN EXISTING SPEED LIMITS THAT 

[Captioner] 20:30:48
ARE CURRENTLY OUT THERE

[Captioner] 20:30:48
 ON OUR STREETS.

[Captioner] 20:30:50
ALSO TO COUNCILMEMBER SHAO'S 

[Captioner] 20:30:53
POINT EARLIER ABOUT THE 

[Captioner] 20:30:56
PROXIMITY TO SCHOOLS, PART OF IT 

[Captioner] 20:30:58
IS ALSO AS HANS MENTIONED 

[Captioner] 20:30:59
EARLIER IS ALSO THE SAFE ROUTE 

[Captioner] 20:31:00
TO SCHOOL.

[Captioner] 20:31:02
THE CONSULTANT DID RECOGNIZE 

[Captioner] 20:31:03
THAT THERE ARE A THUMB BER OF 

[Captioner] 20:31:04
STUDENTS CURRENTLY CROSSING 

[Captioner] 20:31:07
PASEO PADRE, ESPECIALLY AT 

[Captioner] 20:31:08
ISHERWOOD THAT'S CROSSING THE 

[Captioner] 20:31:10
CORRIDOR, SO IT IS FOR THAT 

[Captioner] 20:31:14
REASON THAT THEY FELT THAT 

[Captioner] 20:31:15
INSTEAD OF WRITING THAT ALL INTO 

[Captioner] 20:31:17
IT, THEY DID USE THE PROXIMITY 

[Captioner] 20:31:19
OF BROOKVALE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 

[Captioner] 20:31:24
AS ONE OF THE JUSTIFICATIONS FOR 

[Captioner] 20:31:26
LOWERING THE SPEED LIMIT AN 

[Captioner] 20:31:27
ADDITIONAL FIVE MILES AN HOUR TO 

[Captioner] 20:31:28
I THINK 40 MILES AN HOUR.

[Captioner] 20:31:32
AND LASTLY,

[Captioner] 20:31:33
 PROMISE, REGARDING THE 

[Captioner] 20:31:34
COLLISION RATE, THE MEASURING 

[Captioner] 20:31:37
STICK WE USE THE STATEWIDE 

[Captioner] 20:31:39
AVERAGE FOR COMPARABLE ROADWAY 

[Captioner] 20:31:41
CLASSIFICATIONS, SO CALTRANS 

[Captioner] 20:31:44
ACTUALLY HAS A BOOKLET OR THEY 

[Captioner] 20:31:47
USED TO HAVE A BOOKLET AS 

[Captioner] 20:31:48
PRINTED ON DIFFERENT 

[Captioner] 20:31:50
CLASSIFICATIONS THAT CONSIDER 

[Captioner] 20:31:54
NUMBER OF LANES, AND WHAT THE

[Captioner] 20:31:55
 STATEWIDE COLLISION RATE IS, SO 

[Captioner] 20:31:57
WE USE THAT AS A MEASURING 

[Captioner] 20:31:57
STICK.

[Captioner] 20:32:01
>> Mr. Larsen: LET ME JUST ADD 

[Captioner] 20:32:03
IN TERMS OF CRASH RATES, SORT OF 

[Captioner] 20:32:05
MEASURING THE SUCCESS OF OUR 

[Captioner] 20:32:07
VISION ZERO PROGRAM, THERE'S A 

[Captioner] 20:32:10
MEASUREMENT IN TERMS OF FATALITY 

[Captioner] 20:32:12
CRASH RATES, SO HOW MANY 

[Captioner] 20:32:15
FATALITIES A COMMUNITY HAS PER 

[Captioner] 20:32:15
100,000 PEOPLE.

[Captioner] 20:32:20
AND AT A NATIONAL LEVEL, THAT 

[Captioner] 20:32:23
NUMBER IS LIKE 12, SO 12 

[Captioner] 20:32:25
FATALITIES PER YEAR PER HUNDRED 

[Captioner] 20:32:25
THOUSAND PEOPLE.

[Captioner] 20:32:30
IN CALIFORNIA, THE NUMBER IS

[Captioner] 20:32:34
 AROUND 10, IN THE BAY AREA, THE 

[Captioner] 20:32:35
AVERAGE IS 6.

[Captioner] 20:32:37
AND FREMONT IS CONSIDERED ONE OF 

[Captioner] 20:32:40
THE SAFETY LEADERS IN THE STATE, 

[Captioner] 20:32:41
IN THE COUNTRY.

[Captioner] 20:32:45
OUR NUMBERS ARE RUNNING IN LIKE

[Captioner] 20:32:47
 THE 2 TO 3 RANGE, SO THAT IS A 

[Captioner] 20:32:50
QUARTER OF THE NATIONAL AVERAGE, 

[Captioner] 20:32:51
AND LESS THAN HALF THE BAY AREA 

[Captioner] 20:32:51
AVERAGE.

[Captioner] 20:32:56
SO I THINK WE CERTAINLY FEEL

[Captioner] 20:32:56
 PROUD ABOUT WHAT WE'VE 

[Captioner] 20:32:58
ACCOMPLISHED IN IMPROVING SAFETY 

[Captioner] 20:32:59
IN OUR COMMUNITY AND I THINK 

[Captioner] 20:33:00
THAT'S REFLECTIVE IN THOSE 

[Captioner] 20:33:00
NUMBERS.

[Captioner] 20:33:05
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 20:33:06
>> Councilmember Keng: CAN I 

[Captioner] 20:33:07
FINISH MY COMMENTS?

[Captioner] 20:33:07
>> Mayor Mei: SURE.

[Captioner] 20:33:08
>> Councilmember Keng: THANK 

[Captioner] 20:33:08
YOU.

[Captioner] 20:33:11
SO I JUST WANT TO SHARE THAT I 

[Captioner] 20:33:12
DO AGREE THAT ALONG PASEO PADRE 

[Captioner] 20:33:14
BETWEEN THORNTON AND DECOTO, 

[Captioner] 20:33:17
THERE IS A NEED TO REDUCE THAT 

[Captioner] 20:33:19
SPEED LIMIT BECAUSE CURRENTLY -- 

[Captioner] 20:33:22
LIKE DIRECTOR LARSEN HAD SAID 

[Captioner] 20:33:24
EARLIER, PEOPLE RM ALLOWED TO 

[Captioner] 20:33:26
DRIVE UP TO 10 MILES AN HOUR 

[Captioner] 20:33:27
ABOVE THAT CURRENT SPEED LIMIT, 

[Captioner] 20:33:29
WHICH IS 45, WHICH MEANS PEOPLE 

[Captioner] 20:33:32
ARE DRIVING 65, 60, ALMOST 60 

[Captioner] 20:33:35
MILES PER HOUR, WHICH IS WAY TOO 

[Captioner] 20:33:38
FAST FOR ESPECIALLY STUDENTS 

[Captioner] 20:33:40
CROSSING PASEO PADRE AT 

[Captioner] 20:33:40
ISHERWOOD.

[Captioner] 20:33:43
SO I THINK IN GENERAL, THIS 

[Captioner] 20:33:44
RECOMMENDATION LIST IS ONLY 

[Captioner] 20:33:48
REDUCING THE SPEED LIMIT BY 5 

[Captioner] 20:33:53
MILES PER HOUR, AND WITH THE 

[Captioner] 20:33:56
MODERNIZATION AND THE 

[Captioner] 20:33:57
COORDINATION OF OUR TRAFFIC 

[Captioner] 20:33:59
LIGHTS, WHICH A LOT OF THESE 

[Captioner] 20:34:02
SECTIONS DO COINCIDE WITH, I'M 

[Captioner] 20:34:06
HOPING TO SEE THAT

[Captioner] 20:34:10
 THE MODERNIZATION OF THE LIGHTS

[Captioner] 20:34:14
 WILL BE COMPENSATING THE SPEED 

[Captioner] 20:34:17
REDUCTION TO ALLOW VEHICLES TO 

[Captioner] 20:34:20
TRAVEL EFFICIENTLY WHILE KEEPING 

[Captioner] 20:34:20
EVERYONE SAFER.

[Captioner] 20:34:20
THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 20:34:22
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 20:34:24
NEXT, COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN.

[Captioner] 20:34:30
FOLLOWED BY COUNCILMEMBER 

[Captioner] 20:34:30
CAMPBELL AND SHAO.

[Captioner] 20:34:31
>> Councilmember Salwan: THANK 

[Captioner] 20:34:31
YOU, MADAME MAYOR.

[Captioner] 20:34:34
THANK YOU FOR THE REPORT, AND I 

[Captioner] 20:34:36
RECOGNIZE VICE MAYOR SHAO'S 

[Captioner] 20:34:36
COMMENTS.

[Captioner] 20:34:39
I THINK KIND OF LIKE -- THE WAY 

[Captioner] 20:34:41
WE'RE LOOKING AT IT IS KIND OF 

[Captioner] 20:34:43
THROUGH A FILTER OF SAFETY 

[Captioner] 20:34:45
THROUGH THE VISION ZERO ANGLE, 

[Captioner] 20:34:47
AND I THINK -- AND STAFF CAN 

[Captioner] 20:34:50
CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG, BUT THE 

[Captioner] 20:34:52
BIAS OR THE GOAL IS TO LOWER 

[Captioner] 20:34:54
SPEEDS WHEREVER WE CAN, BUT WE 

[Captioner] 20:34:56
MUST BE ABLE TO LEGALLY JUSTIFY 

[Captioner] 20:34:57
IT.

[Captioner] 20:35:00
AND THIS SURVEY ALLOWS US TO DO 

[Captioner] 20:35:03
THAT, SO THAT WE CAN ENFORCE 

[Captioner] 20:35:05
THOSE SPEEDS AND NOT GET IN 

[Captioner] 20:35:08
TROUBLE, AND SO THIS IS ONE WAY 

[Captioner] 20:35:11
WHERE WE CAN REDUCE SPEEDS IN 

[Captioner] 20:35:13
MAJOR CORRIDORS LIKE PASEO FROM 

[Captioner] 20:35:15
THORNTON TO DECOTO, WHERE 

[Captioner] 20:35:17
THERE'S A LOT OF SPEEDING, AND 

[Captioner] 20:35:19
ALSO THE OTHER WAY TOO, FROM 

[Captioner] 20:35:21
THORNTON TO PERALTA, WHERE IT 

[Captioner] 20:35:22
CURVES.

[Captioner] 20:35:24
SO I THINK LONG TERM, IT WILL 

[Captioner] 20:35:26
RESULT IN SAFETY AND I THINK THE 

[Captioner] 20:35:30
BIGGEST POINT TAKEN IS 35 MILES 

[Captioner] 20:35:32
PER HOUR VERSUS 40 MILES PER 

[Captioner] 20:35:33
HOUR WHICH IS ONLY 5 MILES PER 

[Captioner] 20:35:35
HOUR, BUT THE RESULT IS -- I 

[Captioner] 20:35:37
FORGOT THE EXACT NUMBER FOR 35, 

[Captioner] 20:35:39
BUT I KNOW IT WAS 68% AT 45.

[Captioner] 20:35:41
SO THAT'S A TREMENDOUS INCREASE 

[Captioner] 20:35:42
IN FATALITIES.

[Captioner] 20:35:44
AND SO I THINK FOR THAT REASON, 

[Captioner] 20:35:47
I THINK IT'S DEFINITELY 

[Captioner] 20:35:47
JUSTIFIABLE.

[Captioner] 20:35:49
SO I'M READY TO SUPPORT THIS 

[Captioner] 20:35:50
WHENEVER FOLKS ARE READY WITH 

[Captioner] 20:35:50
THEIR COMMENTS.

[Captioner] 20:35:55
>> Councilmember Cox: IT'S A 

[Captioner] 20:35:55
HEARING.

[Captioner] 20:35:56
>> Councilmember Salwan: THEN 

[Captioner] 20:35:57
WE'LL JUST HEAR IT OUT.

[Captioner] 20:36:00
EXPWHRNCHTS WE HAVE TO ADOPT AN 

[Captioner] 20:36:00
ORDINANCE.

[Captioner] 20:36:01
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: IT IS A 

[Captioner] 20:36:03
PUBLIC HEARING BUT IT'S SET FOR 

[Captioner] 20:36:04
INTRODUCTION THIS EVENING, SO IF 

[Captioner] 20:36:05
THE COUNCIL IS INCLINED TO 

[Captioner] 20:36:06
ACCEPT THE RECOMMENDATION, WHAT 

[Captioner] 20:36:08
YOU WOULD BE DOING IS 

[Captioner] 20:36:09
INTRODUCING THE ORDINANCE AND 

[Captioner] 20:36:11
THEN IT WOULD BE COMING BACK FOR 

[Captioner] 20:36:12
ADOPTION AT A FUTURE CITY 

[Captioner] 20:36:14
COUNCIL MEETING.

[Captioner] 20:36:15
>> Councilmember Salwan: I'LL 

[Captioner] 20:36:15
MOVE THE INTRODUCTION.

[Captioner] 20:36:18
>> Councilmember Cox: SECOND.

[Captioner] 20:36:19
>> Mayor Mei: WE HAVE 

[Captioner] 20:36:20
COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL.

[Captioner] 20:36:20
>> Councilmember Campbell: THANK 

[Captioner] 20:36:20
YOU.

[Captioner] 20:36:24
I JUST WANTED TO ASK, DURING THE 

[Captioner] 20:36:28
SURVEY PROCESS, WAS ANY OF THE 

[Captioner] 20:36:29
COMMUNITY MEMBERS SURVEYED 

[Captioner] 20:36:30
THROUGH THIS PROCESS?

[Captioner] 20:36:34
OR THERE WAS NO -- THAT'S WHAT

[Captioner] 20:36:37
 WHAT -- WITH THE VISION ZERO?

[Captioner] 20:36:39
>> Mr. Larsen: THE SURVEY WE'RE 

[Captioner] 20:36:40
SPEAKING ABOUT NOW IS A 

[Captioner] 20:36:43
TECHNICAL SURVEY WITH RADAR 

[Captioner] 20:36:44
CAMERAS, YOU KNOW, CALCULATING 

[Captioner] 20:36:46
THE SPEEDS OF THE VEHICLES GOING 

[Captioner] 20:36:47
DOWN THE STREET.

[Captioner] 20:36:48
>> Councilmember Campbell: NO, I 

[Captioner] 20:36:50
RECOGNIZE THAT, MR. LARSEN, BUT 

[Captioner] 20:36:52
MY QUESTION WAS, DID WE SURVEY 

[Captioner] 20:36:54
ANY OF THE COMMUNITY MEMBERS 

[Captioner] 20:36:57
ABOUT SPEED LIMITS OR DO WE DO 

[Captioner] 20:36:57
THAT AT ALL?

[Captioner] 20:36:58
NO?

[Captioner] 20:37:00
WE JUST USE THIS TECHNICAL ONE 

[Captioner] 20:37:01
THAT WE HAVE HERE.

[Captioner] 20:37:02
OKAY.

[Captioner] 20:37:07
AND THEN I WANTED TO COMPLIMENT 

[Captioner] 20:37:09
YOU ON THE LIGHTS ON PASEO PADRE 

[Captioner] 20:37:12
BECAUSE I DRIVE DOWN THAT ROAD 

[Captioner] 20:37:13
OFTEN, AND FREMONT BOULEVARD 

[Captioner] 20:37:16
OFTEN, AND THEY'RE SYNCED 

[Captioner] 20:37:16
PERFECTLY.

[Captioner] 20:37:19
I CAN GET DOWN THERE IN A RECORD 

[Captioner] 20:37:20
TIME THAT BEFORE, WHEN I HAD TO 

[Captioner] 20:37:22
STOP AT EVERY SINGLE SOLITARY 

[Captioner] 20:37:23
LIGHT, AND THEN PASEO PADRE WITH 

[Captioner] 20:37:25
THE TRAIN GOING BY, SO BY THE 

[Captioner] 20:37:28
TIME YOU GET PAST THE TRAIN -- I 

[Captioner] 20:37:31
MEAN FREMONT BOULEVARD PAST, YOU 

[Captioner] 20:37:34
GET THE -- THE TRAIN AND THEN 

[Captioner] 20:37:36
THE LIGHTS, SO I WANTED TO 

[Captioner] 20:37:38
COMPLIMENT YOU ON THE 

[Captioner] 20:37:38
SYNCHRONIZATION OF THE LIGHTS.

[Captioner] 20:37:40
SO I THINK WHAT'S LOWERING THE 

[Captioner] 20:37:41
SPEED LIMITS, BECAUSE YOU CAN 

[Captioner] 20:37:42
STILL GET DOWN THERE FASTER 

[Captioner] 20:37:44
BECAUSE THE LIGHTS ARE ALREADY 

[Captioner] 20:37:46
GREEN ALL THE WAY, WOULD HELP US 

[Captioner] 20:37:47
WITH OUR SAFETY.

[Captioner] 20:37:51
AND I DO AGREE THAT THE PASEO 

[Captioner] 20:37:53
PADRE -- WHEN I'VE TALKED TO 

[Captioner] 20:37:54
MANY COMMUNITY MEMBERS WHO LIVE 

[Captioner] 20:37:57
IN THAT AREA, THEY'RE VERY 

[Captioner] 20:37:59
CONCERNED ABOUT THEIR KIDS 

[Captioner] 20:38:00
RIDING BIKES BECAUSE THERE'S A 

[Captioner] 20:38:04
BICYCLE LANE ON PASEO PADRE, AND 

[Captioner] 20:38:05
PEOPLE ARE SPEEDING DOWN THERE 

[Captioner] 20:38:07
50 AND 60 MILES AN HOUR, I'VE 

[Captioner] 20:38:09
SEEN KIDS WOBBLING ON THEIR 

[Captioner] 20:38:11
BIKES SO IT CAN BE VERY, VERY 

[Captioner] 20:38:12
DANGEROUS, SO I WANT TO 

[Captioner] 20:38:14
COMPLIMENT YOU ON LOOKING AT 

[Captioner] 20:38:16
PASEO PADRE AS ONE OF THE 

[Captioner] 20:38:18
PRIORITY CORRIDORS TO REDUCE THE 

[Captioner] 20:38:19
SPEED LIMIT.

[Captioner] 20:38:22
AND I'M WONDERING WHAT CAN WE DO 

[Captioner] 20:38:25
IN TERMS OF ENFORCEMENT, WHAT 

[Captioner] 20:38:28
CAN WE DO TO BROADCAST WIDELY 

[Captioner] 20:38:30
THAT THE SPEED LIMITS ARE GOING 

[Captioner] 20:38:32
DOWN SO THAT PEOPLE RECOGNIZE IT 

[Captioner] 20:38:34
SO THEY CAN -- I MEAN, I KNOW 

[Captioner] 20:38:35
THEY HAVE A LITTLE GRACE PERIOD, 

[Captioner] 20:38:37
BUT I THINK THAT IT'S GOING TO 

[Captioner] 20:38:39
BE VERY, VERY IMPORTANT, 

[Captioner] 20:38:43
ESPECIALLY ON THOSE STEVENSON 

[Captioner] 20:38:44
BOULEVARD, PASEO PADRE, YOU 

[Captioner] 20:38:46
KNOW, SOME OF THE MAJOR 

[Captioner] 20:38:46
CORRIDORS, PEOPLE ARE NOT GOING 

[Captioner] 20:38:48
TO BE PAYING ATTENTION BECAUSE 

[Captioner] 20:38:50
THEY'RE GOING TO BE PLAYING ON 

[Captioner] 20:38:52
THEIR PHONES -- NO, WE DON'T 

[Captioner] 20:38:54
TEXT AND DRIVE, BUT WE WANT TO 

[Captioner] 20:38:58
MAKE SURE THAT THE COMMUNITY IS 

[Captioner] 20:38:59
AWARE THAT NOW THESE SPEED 

[Captioner] 20:39:01
LIMITS ARE REDUCED AND THERE IS 

[Captioner] 20:39:02
A LEVEL OF ENFORCEMENT.

[Captioner] 20:39:04
THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 20:39:07
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 20:39:08
WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND.

[Captioner] 20:39:10
I'LL MAKE QUICK COMMENTS B I 

[Captioner] 20:39:11
WOULD SUPPORT THE QUESTION, I 

[Captioner] 20:39:13
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE SPEED 

[Captioner] 20:39:15
REPORT IS AVAILABLE, SO I WANTED 

[Captioner] 20:39:16
TO MAKE SURE THAT -- I KNOW 

[Captioner] 20:39:18
THERE WAS A SPEAKER EARLIER THAT 

[Captioner] 20:39:18
ASKED ABOUT THAT.

[Captioner] 20:39:20
BUT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IS 

[Captioner] 20:39:21
AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC BEFORE 

[Captioner] 20:39:25
WE GO FOR THE NEXT

[Captioner] 20:39:25
 MEETING.

[Captioner] 20:39:28
AND IT SHOULD BE AVAILABLE RIGHT 

[Captioner] 20:39:28
NOW.

[Captioner] 20:39:31
AND THEN REGARDING THE QUESTION, 

[Captioner] 20:39:32
I WOULD SUPPORT COUNCILMEMBER 

[Captioner] 20:39:34
CAMPBELL, I KNOW HAVING BEEN 

[Captioner] 20:39:35
INVOLVED WITH VISION ZERO IN THE 

[Captioner] 20:39:36
PAST AND SOME OF THE PLANNING 

[Captioner] 20:39:38
FOR THAT, I KNOW THAT SOME OF 

[Captioner] 20:39:40
THE SCHOOL SITES ALSO HAVE OUR 

[Captioner] 20:39:42
SCHOOL RESOURCE OFFICERS AS WELL 

[Captioner] 20:39:44
AS CROSSING GUARDS.

[Captioner] 20:39:46
WE DEFINITELY WELCOME AND 

[Captioner] 20:39:47
APPRECIATE THEIR FEEDBACK AND 

[Captioner] 20:39:49
INPUT INTO THIS PROCESS BECAUSE 

[Captioner] 20:39:51
THEY SEE THINGS MORE DAILY THAN 

[Captioner] 20:39:54
WE MAY HAVE SOMETIMES THE 

[Captioner] 20:39:54
PERSPECTIVE.

[Captioner] 20:39:56
AND I'VE BEEN THERE MYSELF.

[Captioner] 20:39:59
AND THEN ALSO OUR STUDENTS, YOU 

[Captioner] 20:40:01
KNOW, WE'RE JUST SAYING EARLIER 

[Captioner] 20:40:03
TONIGHT WHETHER IT'S OHLONE 

[Captioner] 20:40:06
COLLEGE OR SOME OF THE OTHER 

[Captioner] 20:40:09
ELEMENTARY OR HIGH SCHOOLS, AS 

[Captioner] 20:40:10
OUR STUDENTS ARE TRYING TO GET 

[Captioner] 20:40:12
AROUND, WE'D LOVE TO KNOW WHERE 

[Captioner] 20:40:14
ARE THE BIGGEST RISKS, SO I'D 

[Captioner] 20:40:14
APPRECIATE THAT TOO.

[Captioner] 20:40:16
SO THAT'S JUST SOME OF THE 

[Captioner] 20:40:16
THINGS.

[Captioner] 20:40:18
WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND.

[Captioner] 20:40:19
CAN I GET A VOTE?

[Captioner] 20:40:20
OH, WAIT, SORRY.

[Captioner] 20:40:27
>> Vice Mayor Shao: THANK YOU, 

[Captioner] 20:40:27
MAYOR.

[Captioner] 20:40:31
SO I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT

[Captioner] 20:40:35
 THAT THE FATALITY RATE ANNUALLY 

[Captioner] 20:40:39
IS DEFINITELY NOT 2 TO 3.

[Captioner] 20:40:42
FROM THE REPORT WRITTEN BY THE 

[Captioner] 20:40:45
STAFF, IN 2020, IT SHOWED 

[Captioner] 20:40:50
ACTUALLY AFTER FREMONT STARTED 

[Captioner] 20:40:52
THE VISION ZERO, IN 2016, THE 

[Captioner] 20:40:53
FATALITY IS 4.

[Captioner] 20:40:57
2017, IT'S ACTUALLY 12.

[Captioner] 20:41:05
2018, TO 2020, THE AVERAGE IS 

[Captioner] 20:41:05
5.

[Captioner] 20:41:11
AND SO -- AND ALSO 2020 WAS ONLY 

[Captioner] 20:41:11
THROUGH OCTOBER.

[Captioner] 20:41:13
THEN WE KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.

[Captioner] 20:41:18
THE PANDEMIC HIT US, THE TRAFFIC 

[Captioner] 20:41:21
VOLUME IS MUCH LOWER, SO I'M 

[Captioner] 20:41:24
VERY EAGER TO SEE AN UPDATE ON 

[Captioner] 20:41:28
THE EFFECTIVENESS OF VISION ZERO 

[Captioner] 20:41:32
ON FATALITY COMPAREING WITH THE 

[Captioner] 20:41:35
YEARS BEFORE WE STARTED VISION 

[Captioner] 20:41:39
ZERO, AND ALSO ESPECIALLY THE 

[Captioner] 20:41:42
PERIOD WHEN WE INVESTED A LOT OF 

[Captioner] 20:41:45
MONEY NARROWING DOWN THE LANES, 

[Captioner] 20:41:48
INCREASING THE BIKE LANES, AND 

[Captioner] 20:41:50
WITH ALL THOSE INVESTMENTS, I 

[Captioner] 20:41:53
JUST WANT TO SEE IF THAT 

[Captioner] 20:41:56
INVESTMENT HAS ANY STATISTICALLY 

[Captioner] 20:42:00
DIRECT RELATIONSHIP WITH THE 

[Captioner] 20:42:03
VARIATION OF YEAR TO YEAR 

[Captioner] 20:42:03
FATALITY RATE.

[Captioner] 20:42:06
SO THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT 

[Captioner] 20:42:10
BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN DATA, AND I

[Captioner] 20:42:13
 BELIEVE THAT WE NEED TO HAVE 

[Captioner] 20:42:17
MORE ANALYSIS FOR DATA RATHER 

[Captioner] 20:42:18
THAN JUST THROWING A LOT OF 

[Captioner] 20:42:19
WISHFUL THINKING.

[Captioner] 20:42:23
FOR THE PASEO PADRE PARKWAY, 

[Captioner] 20:42:25
YOUR SURVEY INDICATED THAT FOR 

[Captioner] 20:42:29
ALMOST EACH AND EVERY SECTION, 

[Captioner] 20:42:31
THE SPEED LIMIT SHOULD BE 

[Captioner] 20:42:33
INCREASED BY 5.

[Captioner] 20:42:39
THEN YOU LOWER DOWN BY 5, HENCE 

[Captioner] 20:42:40
FOR MANY SECTIONS, YOU DON'T 

[Captioner] 20:42:41
CHANGE IT.

[Captioner] 20:42:45
BUT THAT IS AFTER

[Captioner] 20:42:48
 YOU LOWER DOWN 5 MILES ON EACH 

[Captioner] 20:42:48
AND EVERY SECTION.

[Captioner] 20:42:52
SO FOR CERTAIN SECTIONS, IT WAS 

[Captioner] 20:42:53
ACTUALLY 5 MILES LOWER.

[Captioner] 20:42:57
SO MY STATEMENT STAYS TRUE, IS 

[Captioner] 20:42:59
THAT WITHOUT A SYSTEMATIC 

[Captioner] 20:43:01
WATERING DOWN THE LIMIT OR 

[Captioner] 20:43:06
LOWERING DOWN THE SPEED LIMIT BY

[Captioner] 20:43:09
 5, THEN FOR A MAJORITY OF THE 

[Captioner] 20:43:11
SECTIONS IN THE PASEO PADRE T 

[Captioner] 20:43:11
REMAINS THE SAME.

[Captioner] 20:43:16
BUT IN CERTAIN AREAS, IT 

[Captioner] 20:43:18
ACTUALLY LOWERS DOWN.

[Captioner] 20:43:21
SO MY BELIEF IS THAT THERE'S A 

[Captioner] 20:43:23
SYSTEMATIC DECISION ALREADY MADE 

[Captioner] 20:43:26
TO LOWERING DOWN -- TO LOWER 

[Captioner] 20:43:28
DOWN THE SPEED LIMIT BY 5 MILES 

[Captioner] 20:43:29
PER HOUR REGARDLESS.

[Captioner] 20:43:30
OKAY?

[Captioner] 20:43:35
AND THEN -- THAT'S

[Captioner] 20:43:40
 WHY INSTEAD OF SEEING 160 ROADS 

[Captioner] 20:43:42
TO BE LOWERED DOWN, WE ONLY SAW 

[Captioner] 20:43:43
30.

[Captioner] 20:43:48
SO THIS ACTUALLY IS A 

[Captioner] 20:43:50
COMBINATION OF THEORETICAL 

[Captioner] 20:43:51
INCREASE, BUT ARTIFICIALLY 

[Captioner] 20:43:52
LOWERING DOWN.

[Captioner] 20:43:54
SO THEN MAJORITY OF THE ROLES 

[Captioner] 20:43:57
ARE REMAINING THE SAME, BUT FOR 

[Captioner] 20:43:59
SOME ROLES, THE 30 THAT YOU 

[Captioner] 20:44:02
MENTIONED, IT ACTUALLY WAS -- 

[Captioner] 20:44:03
ACTUALLY WAS LOWERING DOWN.

[Captioner] 20:44:09
AND SO WITH THAT, I JUST WONDER

[Captioner] 20:44:13
 IF

[Captioner] 20:44:16
 POSSIBLE, IF I COULD MAYBE 

[Captioner] 20:44:18
OFFLINE TALK WITH SOME OF YOU ON 

[Captioner] 20:44:22
CERTAIN AREAS, FOR EXAMPLE, ONE

[Captioner] 20:44:27
 THAT TOTALLY THREW ME OFF BY

[Captioner] 20:44:27
 THE --

[Captioner] 20:44:28
>> Mayor Mei: COUNCILMEMBER 

[Captioner] 20:44:29
SHAO, THIS WILL BE COMING BACK 

[Captioner] 20:44:31
ALSO, SO WE HAVE ALREADY A 

[Captioner] 20:44:32
MOTION AND A SECOND SO I JUST 

[Captioner] 20:44:34
WANTED TO MAKE SURE -- WE ALSO 

[Captioner] 20:44:37
HAVE OUR STENOCAPTIONER WHO -- 

[Captioner] 20:44:38
SO I'D LIKE TO CALL THE QUESTION 

[Captioner] 20:44:38
AND CALL THE VOTE.

[Captioner] 20:44:40
I APOLOGIZE.

[Captioner] 20:44:41
>> Vice Mayor Shao: OKAY.

[Captioner] 20:44:46
>> Ms. Gauthier: COUNCILMEMBER 

[Captioner] 20:44:46
KENG --

[Captioner] 20:44:51
>> Councilmember Keng: I'LL 

[Captioner] 20:44:53
SHARE A QUICK COMMENT, REGARDING 

[Captioner] 20:44:54
VICE MAYOR SHAO'S COMMENT.

[Captioner] 20:44:55
I THINK LOWERING THE SPEED LIMIT 

[Captioner] 20:44:58
IS NOT REALLY GOING TO APPLY TO 

[Captioner] 20:44:59
LIKE HEAVY TRAFFIC TIME, WHEN 

[Captioner] 20:45:01
PEOPLE CANNOT BE DRIVING OVER 40 

[Captioner] 20:45:03
MILES PER HOUR, BUT IT'S MORE 

[Captioner] 20:45:06
TARGETING TOWARDS THE DOWN TIMES 

[Captioner] 20:45:08
LIKE NIGHTTIME, WHERE PEOPLE 

[Captioner] 20:45:09
CAN'T SEE CLEARLY, OR LIKE IN 

[Captioner] 20:45:11
THE MORNING WHEN THERE'S LIKE 

[Captioner] 20:45:13
NOT A LOT OF TRAVELERS, BUT 

[Captioner] 20:45:16
PEOPLE ARE DRIVING 50, 55 MILES 

[Captioner] 20:45:19
DOWN THAT STREET AND HITTING 

[Captioner] 20:45:22
SOMEBODY WOULD HAVE A MUCH WORSE 

[Captioner] 20:45:24
OUTCOME THAN TRAVELING 5 MILES 

[Captioner] 20:45:24
LOWER.

[Captioner] 20:45:28
SO I THINK IT MAY BE -- THAT'S 

[Captioner] 20:45:29
MY LOGIC, MY 2 CENTS.

[Captioner] 20:45:29
THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 20:45:31
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 20:45:33
I HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND.

[Captioner] 20:45:34
I'D LIKE TO CALL THE VOTE, 

[Captioner] 20:45:34
PLEASE.

[Captioner] 20:45:38
THIS WILL STILL BE COMING BACK 

[Captioner] 20:45:39
FOR ADDITIONAL HEARING.

[Captioner] 20:45:44
>> Councilmember Salwan: AND 

[Captioner] 20:45:45
WE'RE INCORPORATING THE GREEN 

[Captioner] 20:45:45
SHEET, RIGHT?

[Captioner] 20:45:47
>> Mayor Mei: YES, AND MAKE SURE 

[Captioner] 20:45:48
WE NOTED THE GREEN SHEET TOO.

[Captioner] 20:45:51
>> Ms. Gauthier: COUNCILMEMBER 

[Captioner] 20:45:54
SALWAN, KENG AND CAMPBELL?

[Captioner] 20:45:56
>> Mayor Mei: FOR SOME REASON IT 

[Captioner] 20:45:56
CLEARED.

[Captioner] 20:45:59
I VOTED, AND I HAD TO PUSH THE 

[Captioner] 20:45:59
BUTTON TWICE.

[Captioner] 20:46:01
>> Ms. Gauthier: COUNCILMEMBER 

[Captioner] 20:46:01
KENG?

[Captioner] 20:46:01
THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 20:46:10
>> Mayor Mei: THE MOTION PASSES 

[Captioner] 20:46:13
WITH VICE MAYOR SHAO VOTING 

[Captioner] 20:46:13

[Captioner] 20:46:15

[Captioner] 20:46:17
THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 20:46:20

 10.05.1000 DECLARED PRIMA FAY 

[Captioner] 20:46:32
SHE SPEED LIMITS.

[Captioner] 20:46:34
ALSO A REMINDER THAT THE NEXT 

[Captioner] 20:46:35
TIME THIS COMES BACK TO THE CITY 

[Captioner] 20:46:36
COUNCIL IT WON'T BE IN THE FORM 

[Captioner] 20:46:37
OF A PUBLIC HEARING, IT WILL 

[Captioner] 20:46:39
LIKELY BE ON YOUR CONSENT 

[Captioner] 20:46:39
CALENDAR.

[Captioner] 20:46:41
THE COUNCIL CAN OF COURSE ALWAYS 

[Captioner] 20:46:43
PULL AN ITEM BUT I WANT TO 

[Captioner] 20:46:44
CLARIFY IT WILL NOT BE A PUBLIC 

[Captioner] 20:46:44
HEARING.

[Captioner] 20:46:45
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 20:46:46
DULY NOTED.

[Captioner] 20:46:52
AT THIS TIME, I WOULD LIKE TO 

[Captioner] 20:46:53
ASK FOR ANY REPORT OUT ON 

[Captioner] 20:46:54
COMMITTEE ASSIGNMENTS.

[Captioner] 20:47:07
THANK YOU FOR STAYING, 

[Captioner] 20:47:07
GENTLEMEN.

[Captioner] 20:47:08
SEEING NONE, I'M GOING TO END 

[Captioner] 20:47:09
AND TAKE A PRIVILEGE AND TALK 

[Captioner] 20:47:12
ABOUT REAL QUICKLY FOR THE CITY 

[Captioner] 20:47:13
OF FREMONT, EARLIER THIS EVENING 

[Captioner] 20:47:16
WE HAD OUR YOUTH SPEAK AND SHARE 

[Captioner] 20:47:17
AND WE'RE RECOGNIZING THEM.

[Captioner] 20:47:19
BUT WE LEARNED FROM HISTORY 

[Captioner] 20:47:20
THAT'S BEING MADE AS WELL AS 

[Captioner] 20:47:22
HISTORY IN THE PAST, AND I JUST 

[Captioner] 20:47:23
WANTED TO NOTE THE IMPORTANCE OF 

[Captioner] 20:47:27
THE DAY OF REMEMBRANCE

[Captioner] 20:47:29
 FOR JAPANESE AMERICAN 

[Captioner] 20:47:29
INCARCERATION.

[Captioner] 20:47:31
SO ON SUNDAY, WE COMMEMORATED 

[Captioner] 20:47:33
THE DAY OF REMEMBRANCE, A SOLEMN 

[Captioner] 20:47:36
OCCASION WHICH REMINDS OF A DARK 

[Captioner] 20:47:37
CHAPTER OF OUR NATION'S HISTORY, 

[Captioner] 20:47:40
THE FORCED INCARCERATION OF OVER 

[Captioner] 20:47:44
120,000 AMERICANS OF JAPANESE 

[Captioner] 20:47:44
DESCENT.

[Captioner] 20:47:46
AS THE MAYOR OF FREMONT ONE OF 

[Captioner] 20:47:47
OUR ROOTS AND FOUNDATION AS WE 

[Captioner] 20:47:49
MENTIONED EARLIER TONIGHT, IT'S 

[Captioner] 20:47:50
IMMIGRANTS, FARMERS, BUSINESS 

[Captioner] 20:47:54
LEADERS AND EVEN OUR FIRST ASIAN

[Captioner] 20:47:57
 COUNCILMEMBER, AND SO I WANTED 

[Captioner] 20:47:59
TO SAY IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT WE 

[Captioner] 20:48:01
REFLECT ON THIS PAINFUL PERIOD 

[Captioner] 20:48:02
AND ACKNOWLEDGE THE PROFOUND 

[Captioner] 20:48:02
IMPACT.

[Captioner] 20:48:06
SO PRESIDENT BIDEN HAD HONORED 

[Captioner] 20:48:08
THAT, AND I'D LIKE TO JUST 

[Captioner] 20:48:09
ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO REMEMBER THE 

[Captioner] 20:48:12
COURAGE AND RESILIENCE IN TERMS 

[Captioner] 20:48:15
OF THE HATE AND WE STAND AGAINST 

[Captioner] 20:48:17
RACISM, XENOPHOBIA, ALL 

[Captioner] 20:48:18
RELIGIOUS PHOBIA AND ALL HATE.

[Captioner] 20:48:21
SO WE'RE COMMITTED TO THE 

[Captioner] 20:48:23
DEMOCRACY AND PROTECTING CIVIL 

[Captioner] 20:48:24
LIBERTIES OF THOSE IN OUR UNITED 

[Captioner] 20:48:24
STATES.

[Captioner] 20:48:28
BY ACKNOWLEDGING THE FEDERAL 

[Captioner] 20:48:29
GOVERNMENT'S FORMAL APOLOGY, AND 

[Captioner] 20:48:31
THIS ALSO OCCURRED AT SAN JOSÉ 

[Captioner] 20:48:34
STATE TO JAPANESE AMERICANS AND 

[Captioner] 20:48:38
REAFFIRMING THE PRINCIPLE OF 

[Captioner] 20:48:40
NEDOTO NYS.

[Captioner] 20:48:42
YURI, THAT IT NEVER HAPPEN 

[Captioner] 20:48:42
AGAIN.

[Captioner] 20:48:43
SO I JUST WANTED TO MENTION 

[Captioner] 20:48:44
THAT.

[Captioner] 20:48:45
WE HAVE BEEN FORTUNATE.

[Captioner] 20:48:47
I ALSO WANTED TO NOTE REAL 

[Captioner] 20:48:51
QUICKLY THAT I WANT TO THANK 

[Captioner] 20:48:52
THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN IN PUBLIC 

[Captioner] 20:48:53
SAFETY AND SOME OF THE LIVES 

[Captioner] 20:48:55
THAT HAVE BEEN LOST.

[Captioner] 20:48:58
I SERVE ON THE CONFERENCE OF 

[Captioner] 20:49:01
MAYORS, AND I JUST LEFT MY 

[Captioner] 20:49:02
COLLEAGUE FROM BURNSVILLE, 

[Captioner] 20:49:04
MINNESOTA AND SO I KNOW MY HEART 

[Captioner] 20:49:06
GOES OUT TO THOSE WHO HAVE LOST
