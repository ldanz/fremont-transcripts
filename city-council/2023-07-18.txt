[Captioner] 19:07:24
 PUBLIC COMMUNICATIONS, SOMETIMES PEOPLE WONDER IF IT'S NOT

[Captioner] 19:07:27
 AGENDIZED, WE NORMALLY ARE NOT ENGAGING PEOPLE IN THAT BECAUSE IT'S 

[Captioner] 19:07:30
NOT BEEN AGENDIZED AND TO ENSURE THE PUBLIC HAS EQUAL

[Captioner] 19:07:33

[Captioner] 19:07:38

SO THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:07:43
>> Mr. Quintanilla: WE HAVE SIX SPEAKER CARDS.


[Captioner] 19:07:47
OUR FIRST SPEAKER IS ALBERT SI

[Captioner] 19:07:50
 FOLLOWED BY PRIYA

[Captioner] 19:07:53
 CHUHAN.
>> Mayor Mei: WELCOME.


[Captioner] 19:08:08
>> HI.
MY NAME IS ALBERT, LAST NAME IS

[Captioner] 19:08:12
 TSUI.
I WANT TO BRING -- WE ARE REPRESENTING

[Captioner] 19:08:15
 THE IRVINGTON COMMUNITY.
WE WANT TO BRING TO YOUR

[Captioner] 19:08:19
 ATTENTION THE ISSUE WE HAVE IN IRVINGTON PARK.


[Captioner] 19:08:24
WE WANT TO BRING FORWARD THE

[Captioner] 19:08:27
 CONTINUING ISSUE WE'RE HAVING IN THE IRVINGTON

[Captioner] 19:08:30
 NEIGHBORHOOD, IT'S TURNING INTO A NUISANCE AND IS A PRIVACY

[Captioner] 19:08:34
 ISSUE.
A BUNCH OF US WANT TO

[Captioner] 19:08:37
 PROVIDE THE CITY THE SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE IN WRITTEN

[Captioner] 19:08:40
 RECORD SO THAT WE CAN LEGALLY STOP THE RV AND

[Captioner] 19:08:42
 INCREASING THE HOMELESS PARKING IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.


[Captioner] 19:08:45
WE WANT TO INCLUDE

[Captioner] 19:08:48
 SAFETY, VEHICLE INFRACTIONS, NUISANCE, PRIVACY AND LONG TERM.


[Captioner] 19:08:52
PLEASE NOTE THOSE RVs HAVE BEEN PARKING

[Captioner] 19:08:54
 SINCE JUNE 12TH, THAT HAS BEEN A WHILE NOW.


[Captioner] 19:08:58
IF YOU SEE THAT, RVs

[Captioner] 19:09:01
 ARE PARKING ON SIDEWALKS.
THEY HAVE DOGS,

[Captioner] 19:09:04
 PEOPLE TRYING TO AVOID THEM, THEY HAVE RV

[Captioner] 19:09:08
 AWNINGS AND -- STICKING ON THE SIDEWALK,

[Captioner] 19:09:11
 THERE ARE BIKES, SHOULDERS, WAGONS, AND THEY LEAVE THE

[Captioner] 19:09:15
 CAR DOOR OPEN.
THIS IS PUSHING SOME OF OUR

[Captioner] 19:09:18
 ELDERLY AND KIDS TO GO ON THE OTHER SIDE,

[Captioner] 19:09:21
 HAVING TO CROSS THE STREET.
THAT IS VERY

[Captioner] 19:09:24
 DANGEROUS.
YOU WILL SEE THE DIFFERENT PICTURES OF 

[Captioner] 19:09:27
THE AWNINGS AND THE STUFF THEY LEAVE BEHIND, THE DOGS AND

[Captioner] 19:09:30
 STUFF LIKE THAT.
THIS IS DEFINITELY A SAFETY

[Captioner] 19:09:33
 HAZARD, BECAUSE THOSE RVs ARE VERY BIG.


[Captioner] 19:09:37
BECAUSE THEY'RE SO BIG, THEY'RE BLOCKING THE VIEW

[Captioner] 19:09:40
 IN PEOPLE CROSSING THE STREET.
ALSO WE HAD AN INCIDENT WHERE A

[Captioner] 19:09:43
 PARAMEDIC WAS TRYING TO TAKE CARE OF THE HOMELESS, IT WAS BLOCKING

[Captioner] 19:09:46
 THE ENTIRE STREET, MAKING IT A

[Captioner] 19:09:49
 ONE-LANE ROAD.
THAT IS NOT VERY SAFE FOR THE 

[Captioner] 19:09:53
RESIDENTS.
IT ALSO A HEALTH SAFETY

[Captioner] 19:09:57
 HAZARD, BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE SMOKING, THEY ARE EVEN SMOKING

[Captioner] 19:10:00
 MARIJUANA, SO THE PEOPLE CAN SMELL IT FROM THEIR HOME IN THE

[Captioner] 19:10:03
 BACKYARD.
ALSO THEY HAVE -- THEY SOMETIMES TURN 

[Captioner] 19:10:06
ON THE ENGINE, THEY EVEN HAVE POWER

[Captioner] 19:10:09
 GENERATOR RUNNING, TO RUN AIR

[Captioner] 19:10:11
 CONDITIONING, TVs AND STUFF LIKE THAT.


[Captioner] 19:10:14
THE EXHAUST FUME IS ACTUALLY VERY

[Captioner] 19:10:17
 HAZARDOUS AND IS AN ALLERGEN.
ALSO REMIND YOU

[Captioner] 19:10:21
 GUYS, RIGHT, ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO, JULY,

[Captioner] 19:10:24
 I THINK --

[Captioner] 19:10:28
 MAY 13TH, WE HAD A HOMELESS PERSON COMING TO PARK

[Captioner] 19:10:31
 GATE, THEY RAPED A 65, I THINK,

[Captioner] 19:10:35
 65-YEAR-OLD WOMAN IN FRONT OF ONE OF OUR FRONT YARD.


[Captioner] 19:10:40
YOU GUYS CAME TOGETHER, THE POLICE CAME TOGETHER

[Captioner] 19:10:44
 AND HELPED US RECOVER FROM THAT INCIDENT

[Captioner] 19:10:46
.
OKAY.


[Captioner] 19:10:50
30 SECONDS.
ALSO WHERE THE RV IS

[Captioner] 19:10:53
 PARKED RIGHT NOW, IT'S VERY CLOSE TO THE ROBERTSON

[Captioner] 19:10:56
 HIGH SCHOOL.
BECAUSE THEY'RE SO CLOSE, IT'S AN 

[Captioner] 19:11:00
ALLEYWAY, THE KIDS DEFINITELY WALK IN THE ALLEY TO GO TO SCHOOL, TO GO

[Captioner] 19:11:03
 TO ROBERTSON, AND IRVINGTON.
SO THAT

[Captioner] 19:11:06
 IS -- BECAUSE OF WHATEVER IS GOING ON IN THOSE RVs, THAT

[Captioner] 19:11:08
 IS VERY, VERY DANGEROUS.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:11:14
>> Mr. Quintanilla: OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS PRIYA.


[Captioner] 19:11:17
GLL HELLO, EVERYONE.
MY NAME IS PRIYA.


[Captioner] 19:11:18
I CAN POINT OUT THE VEHICLE INFRACTIONS.


[Captioner] 19:11:22
SO THERE IS NO AUTHENTICITY OF THESE VEHICLES.


[Captioner] 19:11:25
THE POSSESSION OF THESE CARS THAT IS A

[Captioner] 19:11:28
 VERY -- THAT RAISES A THEFT CONCERNS FOR THE

[Captioner] 19:11:32
 IRVINGTON RESIDENTS.
THESE RV OWNER CARS, THEY DO

[Captioner] 19:11:34
 NOT HAVE ANY LICENSE PLATE IN THE FRONT OR BACK OF THE CAR.


[Captioner] 19:11:38
THERE'S EXPIRED LICENSE PLATE, THEY NEED

[Captioner] 19:11:41
 TO ENFORCE -- THEY'RE

[Captioner] 19:11:44
 NOT -- THE CITY'S RECREATIONAL VEHICLE PARKING ORDINANCE.


[Captioner] 19:11:47
THE OTHER FACT WE POINT OUT IS THE NUISANCE THEY

[Captioner] 19:11:51
 ARE CAUSING.
THE TRASH IN FRONT OF THE

[Captioner] 19:11:53
 RVs AND THE SIDEWALKS, UNDER THE RFP V.


[Captioner] 19:11:56
WE HAVE NOTICED ONE BIG RV, NO ONE LIVES

[Captioner] 19:11:58
 INSIDE IT, THEY JUST TRASH
>> All: OVER THE PLACE.


[Captioner] 19:12:02
THIS IS RUINING THE'S

[Captioner] 19:12:05
 THE ESTHETICS OF THE COMMUNITY.


[Captioner] 19:12:08
THE OTHER THING WE WANT TO POINT OUT IS THEY PLAY

[Captioner] 19:12:12
 LOUD MUSIC AT NIGHT.
I LIVE VERY CLOSE TO WHERE ONE OF

[Captioner] 19:12:15
 THE RVs IS PARKED

[Captioner] 19:12:18
 AND LATE NIGHTS, THERE ARE INCIDENTS WHERE WE CANNOT SLEAP

[Captioner] 19:12:22
 SLEEP BECAUSE OF THIS REASON SO THAT IS A VERY BIG

[Captioner] 19:12:25
 NUISANCE FOR US, THE LATE NIGHT YELLING AND THE LOUD MUSIC, THERE'S NO

[Captioner] 19:12:27
 QUIET ENJOYMENT.
IT AFFECTS THE PEACE AND THE QUIETNESS 

[Captioner] 19:12:30
OF OUR NEIGHBORHOOD AND SINCE IT IS JUST STANDING BEHIND SOME OF THE

[Captioner] 19:12:34
 RESIDENTS BACKYARDS

[Captioner] 19:12:37
 -- THE OTHER POINT I CAN POINT OUT IS THE URINATION.


[Captioner] 19:12:40
IT CREATES A SMELLY AREA AND IT'S VERY UNHYGIENIC FOR OUR COMMUNITY.


[Captioner] 19:12:45
DEFINITELY THE FREQUENT BARKING OF THE DOGS, THERE

[Captioner] 19:12:48
 ARE LIKE THREE PIT BULLS IN THOSE RVs AND THE FREQUENT

[Captioner] 19:12:52
 BARKING LATE NIGHTS, THIS IS CAUSING A VERY

[Captioner] 19:12:56
 DISTURBED NATURE IN THERE.
THERE WAS ALSO ONE INCIDENT

[Captioner] 19:12:59
 WHERE ONE RESIDENT REPORTED THAT A WOMAN WAS TAKING A SHOWER USING THE

[Captioner] 19:13:03
 LAWN SPRINKLER.
SO THIS LACKS

[Captioner] 19:13:06
 THE MODESTY AND WE REALLY WANT TO

[Captioner] 19:13:09
 REPORT THIS THING.
IF I TALK ON THE PRIVACY, THERE IS 

[Captioner] 19:13:12
DEFINITELY PRIVACY CONCERNS.
THERE WAS ONE INCIDENT

[Captioner] 19:13:16
 WHERE ONE OF THE -- WAS STANDING ON

[Captioner] 19:13:19
 TOP OF THE RV PEEKING INTO THE BACKYARDS AND INSIDE THE HOUSES.


[Captioner] 19:13:21
THIS IS A VERY CONCERNING MATTER FOR US.


[Captioner] 19:13:26
WE DON'T FEEL SAFE IN OUR HOUSES, AND WE FEEL FRIGHTENED ALL THE

[Captioner] 19:13:29
 TIME.
SO THE

[Captioner] 19:13:32
 OTHER THING IS THEY EXTEND THEIR

[Captioner] 19:13:35
 AWNINGS WHICH MAKE THEM VERY EASY TO ENTER INTO DIFFERENT

[Captioner] 19:13:39
 BACKYARDS.
WE ARE CONCERNED, WE CANNOT LEAVE OUR 

[Captioner] 19:13:41
HOMES UNATTENDED AND WE ARE UNABLE TO USE OUR BACKYARDS.


[Captioner] 19:13:47
WE ALSO

[Captioner] 19:13:50
 -- SOME POLICE OFFICERS ARE HELPFUL BUT WE HAVE RECEIVED THIS RESPONSE

[Captioner] 19:13:54
 TO SHUT DOWN YOUR CURTAINS AND TO TURN OFF THE

[Captioner] 19:13:57
 LIGHTS AND YOU CAN JUST -- SO THIS WAS VERY SHOCKING FOR

[Captioner] 19:13:59
 US.
WE CANNOT JUST -- I MEAN, WE BOUGHT 

[Captioner] 19:14:02
THE HOME, WE CANNOT JUST SHUT ON THE CURTAINS AND SIT

[Captioner] 19:14:04
 INSIDE.
SO THAT WAS ONE THING.


[Captioner] 19:14:07
THE OTHER ONE I CAN POINT OUT IS THE TRESPASSING.


[Captioner] 19:14:10
MAYBE YOU CAN CONTINUE ON THAT.
THANK YOU FOR THIS.


[Captioner] 19:14:17
>> Mr. Quintanilla: OUR NEXT

[Captioner] 19:14:20
 SPEAKER --
>>

[Captioner] 19:14:24
 I'LL CONTINUE WHAT PRIYA WAS SAYING

[Captioner] 19:14:27
 BASICALLY SO TRESPASSING

[Captioner] 19:14:30
 AS WELL, HOMELESS PEOPLE ARE BASICALLY ENTERING ON THE PRIVATE

[Captioner] 19:14:32
 PROPERTY.
IT'S A COMMUNITY, RIGHT, AND WE SEE 

[Captioner] 19:14:36
THESE PEOPLE, LIKE, DRIVING THEIR VEHICLES IN THE

[Captioner] 19:14:39
 STREET JUST ROAMING AROUND, ROAMING IN

[Captioner] 19:14:43
 CIRCLE, AND WE SAW LIKE ONE RV

[Captioner] 19:14:46
 OWNER TRUCK, IT WAS BASICALLY CIRCLING AROUND IN THE COMMUNITY ALL THE TIME.


[Captioner] 19:14:49
AND NOBODY IS BASICALLY GOING TO STOP THEM.


[Captioner] 19:14:52
SOMETIMES WE SEE THESE PEOPLE JUST WALKING WITH TRASH OR

[Captioner] 19:14:56
 OTHER STUFF, I CAN'T

[Captioner] 19:14:59
 REALLY DESCRIBE HERE.
SO THESE ARE THE LIKE ALL

[Captioner] 19:15:01
 POINTS.
NOW COMING BACK TO THE NEXT POINT, 

[Captioner] 19:15:05
WHICH IS LONG TERM DISADVANTAGE TO IRVINGTON

[Captioner] 19:15:08
 RESIDENTS, SO RIGHT NOW THE WAY

[Captioner] 19:15:12
 RVs PARK AND THESE PEOPLE ARE BASICALLY BEHAVING, THAT WE

[Captioner] 19:15:15
 CAN'T ACCESS THE YARD FROM OUTSIDE SO IF YOU

[Captioner] 19:15:18
 WANT TO DO FRUITS, WE HAVE OUR

[Captioner] 19:15:22
 HOA CLEANS UP THE TREES, TRIMMING AND ALL, WE CAN'T ACCESS

[Captioner] 19:15:25
 THAT, BECAUSE BASICALLY RVs ARE PARKED AND YOU CAN'T

[Captioner] 19:15:28
 POSSIBLY REACH OR DO ANY CLEANING OUTSIDE OUTLINE OF THE

[Captioner] 19:15:32
 STREET.


[Captioner] 19:15:35
AND RESIDENTS HAVE TO AVOID THE RVs AND CROSS THE STREET TO WALK

[Captioner] 19:15:37
 AROUND THE NEIGHBORHOOD.
BASICALLY IT'S A TWO-WAY STREET BUT 

[Captioner] 19:15:40
ONE OF THE SIDEWALK IS BASICALLY BECOME UNUSABLE.


[Captioner] 19:15:44
YOU CAN'T DO ANYTHING, RIGHT, SO

[Captioner] 19:15:47
 WHETHER IT'S EMERGENCY VEHICLE OR PEOPLE PASSING,

[Captioner] 19:15:50
 JUST LIKE NOW WHOLE TRAFFIC SHIFTED TO ONE WAY.


[Captioner] 19:15:54
AND EVENTUALLY, PROPERTY VALUES WILL

[Captioner] 19:15:57
 GO DOWN.
THAT'S I THINK OBVIOUS.


[Captioner] 19:16:01
RENTERS

[Captioner] 19:16:04
 WILL MOVE OUT, WE ALREADY HAD CONVERSATION,

[Captioner] 19:16:08
 THEY DON'T WANT TO RENEW THEIR LEASES

[Captioner] 19:16:11
 ANYMORE.
NOW, COMING BACK TO THE POLICE

[Captioner] 19:16:14
 RESPONSE, BASICALLY WE ARE

[Captioner] 19:16:19
 ANNOYED, SARCASTIC, THEIR RESPONSE

[Captioner] 19:16:22
 IS THERE NOTHING WE CAN DO, THERE IS NO POLICY.


[Captioner] 19:16:26
TRASH IS NO LONGER

[Captioner] 19:16:29
 VISIBLE, SO SOMEBODY WILL BE THERE TO APPRECIATE THE POINT BUT IT WILL BE 

[Captioner] 19:16:32
AFTER THE FACT, LIKE THREE, FOUR HOURS AFTER WE REPORT IT.


[Captioner] 19:16:36
AND THE

[Captioner] 19:16:39
 TIME -- THEY JUST MOVE INSIDE.
SO IT'S

[Captioner] 19:16:42
 NOT REALLY HELPING THE CAUSE.
WE ARE TAX-PAYING

[Captioner] 19:16:46
 CITIZENS YET HOMELESS HAS MORE RIGHTS AND PRIVILEGES THAN WE

[Captioner] 19:16:50
 DO, AND IRVINGTON RESIDENTS WERE TOLD BY THE POLICE

[Captioner] 19:16:53
 TO SHUT OUR CURTAINS AND TURN ON OUR LIGHTS IN

[Captioner] 19:16:56
 IN THE DAY TIME.
THAT'S NOT HOW IT SHOULD BE.


[Captioner] 19:17:00
WE EXPECT BETTER FROM THE CITY AND POLICE AND

[Captioner] 19:17:04
 BETTER FOR OUR COMMUNITIES.
SO THAT'S ALL FROM MY SIDE, AND I'LL 

[Captioner] 19:17:05
PASS ON TO THE NEXT SPEAKER.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:17:11
>> Mr. Quintanilla: OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS

[Captioner] 19:17:16
 IANSIA LIN.
>> THANK

[Captioner] 19:17:18
 YOU, CITY COUNCILMEMBERS AND FELLOW RESIDENTS.


[Captioner] 19:17:21
I WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS MY OWN

[Captioner] 19:17:25
 CONCERNS ABOUT THE ISSUE OF OUR PRIVACY OF OUR

[Captioner] 19:17:28
 COMMUNITY IN IRVINGTON.
THE IMPACT OF THIS

[Captioner] 19:17:32
 SITUATION IS SEVERE.
MANY IRVINGTON

[Captioner] 19:17:35
 RESIDENT NOW, THEY ARE RELUCTANT TO LEAVE THEIR

[Captioner] 19:17:38
 HOMES UNATTENDED FOR A PERIOD OF TIME AND THEY ARE UNABLE

[Captioner] 19:17:41
 TO ENJOY THE USE OF THEIR OWN PROPERTIES'

[Captioner] 19:17:45
 BACKYARDS.


[Captioner] 19:17:49
ALSO THE

[Captioner] 19:17:54
 INTRUSION INTO OUR PRIVATE SPACES AND SENSE OF INSECURITY CAUSED BY THIS,

[Captioner] 19:17:57
 IT'S REALLY VERY TROUBLING.
I COULDN'T SLEEP ACTUALLY

[Captioner] 19:18:00
.
AS RESIDENTS, WE DESERVE THE RIGHT TO 

[Captioner] 19:18:03
FEEL SAFE AND SECURE WITHIN OUR OWN HOMES AND NEIGHBORHOODS.


[Captioner] 19:18:09
REGARDING THE RVs

[Captioner] 19:18:13
, NAVIGATE AROUND

[Captioner] 19:18:16
 THEM CROSS STREET -- COMMUNITY CONCERNS.


[Captioner] 19:18:19
OF COURSE THE PROPERTY VALUES ARE AT STAKE AS WE ARE REQUIRED

[Captioner] 19:18:22
 TO DISCLOSE ANY NEIGHBORHOOD NOISE PROBLEMS AND OTHER

[Captioner] 19:18:26
 NUISANCES WHEN SELLING

[Captioner] 19:18:29
 WHICH CAN DETER POTENTIAL BUYERS AND OVERALL VALUES.


[Captioner] 19:18:32
I KNOW I HAVE RENTERS AS MY NEIGHBORS, THEY ARE CONSIDERING MOVING OUT

[Captioner] 19:18:34
 JUST BECAUSE OF ALL THE THINGS HAPPENING RECENTLY.


[Captioner] 19:18:38
UNFORTUNATELY, THE POLICE RESPONSE HAS BEEN

[Captioner] 19:18:40
 DISMISSIVE, OFFERING LITTLE ASSISTANCE.


[Captioner] 19:18:44
THEIR SUGGESTION TO SHUT CURTAINS

[Captioner] 19:18:47
 AND TURN ON LIGHTS DURING THE DAY DOES NOT REALLY ADDRESS THE

[Captioner] 19:18:50
 INVASION OF PRIVACY WE ARE EXPERIENCING

[Captioner] 19:18:54
.
IN CONSIDERING ALTERNATIVE SITES, WE

[Captioner] 19:18:58
 PROPOSE LEAST INTRUSIVE

[Captioner] 19:19:01
 OPTIONS.
ONE IS THE BLACOW ROADSIDE OF

[Captioner] 19:19:04
 IRVINGTON COMMUNITY PARK, WHERE THE OTHER RVs AND THE CARS ARE ALREADY

[Captioner] 19:19:07
 PARKING THERE, WHICH WOULD NOT DIRECTLY AFFECT

[Captioner] 19:19:11
 ADJACENT RESIDENTIAL AREA.
ANOTHER OPTION WILL BE

[Captioner] 19:19:14
 THE LAKE ELIZABETH PARKING AREA, WHERE MOST PARKING SPOTS

[Captioner] 19:19:16
 ARE NOT ADJACENT TO ANY RESIDENTIAL HOMES.


[Captioner] 19:19:19
SO THAT'S ALL I HAVE.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:19:26
>> Mr. Quintanilla: OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS HU LI.


[Captioner] 19:19:29
>> THANK YOU.
I'D LIKE

[Captioner] 19:19:32
 TO RECAP THE MAIN POINTS.


[Captioner] 19:19:37
 OUR NEIGHBORED HAVE PRESENTED.


[Captioner] 19:19:41
WE HAVE LEAST INTRUSIVE SITES FOR RV PARKING SUCH AS

[Captioner] 19:19:44
 BLACOW ROAD SITE OF IRVINGTON COMMUNITY PARK

[Captioner] 19:19:48
 AND ELIZABETH LAKE PARKING AREA.
AND AS WE MENTIONED, OUR SAFETY

[Captioner] 19:19:51
 CONCERNS ARISE DUE TO THE BLOCKED SIDEWALKS

[Captioner] 19:19:54
 AND WHICH FORCE MORE PEOPLE TO WALK ON THE STREET.


[Captioner] 19:19:58
AND IS PARTICULARLY UNSAFE FOR

[Captioner] 19:20:01
 ELDERLY AND THE CHILDREN.
OBSTRUCTED

[Captioner] 19:20:04
 VIEW CAUSED BY RVs CAN LEAD TO ACCIDENTS.


[Captioner] 19:20:08
OUR COMMUNITY IS ALREADY TROUBLED BY THE

[Captioner] 19:20:13
 SPEED IN THIS AREA AND RVs MAKE

[Captioner] 19:20:16
 THIS EVEN WORSE.
PRIVACY IS BEING

[Captioner] 19:20:19
 COMPROMISED, CAUSING FEAR OF THEFT AND

[Captioner] 19:20:22
 REDUCING OUR SENSE OF SECURITY.


[Captioner] 19:20:29
MOREOVER, IT RESTRICTS RESIDENTS' USAGE OF THEIR OWN

[Captioner] 19:20:31
 BACKYARDS INFRINGING ON THEIR PERSONAL SPACE.


[Captioner] 19:20:35
AND THE NUISANCE OF LOUD NOISE GENERATED BY

[Captioner] 19:20:38
 RVs DISRUPTS THE PEACE AND QUIET OF OUR

[Captioner] 19:20:41
 NEIGHBORHOODS, AND FURTHER DETERIORATING THE QUALITY

[Captioner] 19:20:44
 OF OUR -- OF LIFE FOR OUR RESIDENTS.


[Captioner] 19:20:49
AS MENTIONED, THE ESTHETICS OF OUR COMMUNITY

[Captioner] 19:20:52
 INCLUDING THE IRVINGTON COMMUNITY PARK AND THE SURROUNDING NEIGHBORHOODS

[Captioner] 19:20:56
 ARE BEING NEGATIVELY

[Captioner] 19:20:59
 IMPACTED BY THE RVs.
LASTLY,

[Captioner] 19:21:03
 THE CONTINUED PRESENCE OF RVs AND

[Captioner] 19:21:06
 HOMELESS CAR PARKING CAN SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT PROPERTY VALUES

[Captioner] 19:21:09
 AND DISCOURAGING FUTURE RENTERS, LEADING

[Captioner] 19:21:12
 TO POTENTIAL ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCE FOR OUR COMMUNITY.


[Captioner] 19:21:17
IN CONCLUSION, WE ASK THE CITY COUNCIL TO

[Captioner] 19:21:21
 TAKE THE NECESSARY ACTIONS TO RELOCATE THOSE

[Captioner] 19:21:24
 RVs AND HELP PROTECT OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.


[Captioner] 19:21:29
THE COMMUNITY HAS PROVIDED SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE

[Captioner] 19:21:32
 IN A WRITTEN RECORD,

[Captioner] 19:21:36
 AND LET'S WORK TOGETHER TO ENSURE THE WELL-BEING AND THE

[Captioner] 19:21:39
 PROSPERITY OF OUR BELOVED IRVINGTON COMMUNITY.


[Captioner] 19:21:42
THANK YOU, AND ALSO I'D LIKE TO ASK

[Captioner] 19:21:46
 OUR COMMUNITY TO STAND UP TO SUPPORT

[Captioner] 19:21:49
 OUR ARGUMENT.


[Captioner] 19:21:53
AND WE ALL APPRECIATE CITY COUNCIL'S HELP ON THIS

[Captioner] 19:21:54
 ISSUE.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:21:58
>> Mr. Quintanilla: OUR NEXT SPEAKER

[Captioner] 19:22:02
 IS JOHN NEI.


[Captioner] 19:22:05
FOLLOWED BY S

[Captioner] 19:22:09
ALIM MUSTON.


[Captioner] 19:22:14
>> HI, CITY COUNCIL.
MY NAME

[Captioner] 19:22:18
 IS JOHN.
I LIVE IN THE

[Captioner] 19:22:20
 PARK GATE COMMUNITY.
SO I'VE TAKEN SOME PICTURES AND I HOPE 

[Captioner] 19:22:23
YOU CAN SEE IT.
YOU KNOW, THIS SHOWS SOME OF THE 

[Captioner] 19:22:25
THINGS THAT'S BEEN HAPPENING INSIDE PARK GATE ITSELF.


[Captioner] 19:22:28
YOU KNOW, ALONG THE SURROUNDING AREA ON GREEN PARK.


[Captioner] 19:22:33
SO I TOOK THAT, AND

[Captioner] 19:22:37
 ALSO -- I'M ALSO PROVIDING, YOU KNOW, PICTURES OF

[Captioner] 19:22:40
 IRVINGTON COMMUNITY CENTER AS WELL, BECAUSE I WANT TO SHOW

[Captioner] 19:22:43
 YOU JUST AN EXAMPLE OF IT.
WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE

[Captioner] 19:22:46
 IRVINGTON COMMUNITY CENTER IS THAT IT'S ATTRACTING A LOT OF

[Captioner] 19:22:49
 HOMELESS PEOPLE IN RVs.
THAT HAS SPREAD, NOT

[Captioner] 19:22:52
 ONLY FROM THE IRVINGTON COMMUNITY

[Captioner] 19:22:55
 CENTER, BUT ALSO THE SURROUNDING AREAS ON GREEN PARK.


[Captioner] 19:23:01
THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR ABOUT TWO YEARS AND THERE'S NOTHING THAT'S

[Captioner] 19:23:04
 BEEN DONE FOR IT.
THIS IS WHAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT IN 

[Captioner] 19:23:09
TERMS OF GREEN PARK ITSELF.


[Captioner] 19:23:12
IT STARTED OFF WITH ONE AND NOW THERE'S LIKE THREE, AND THEN

[Captioner] 19:23:14
 THERE'S FOUR.
I CAN'T SEE HOW THIS IS GETTING 

[Captioner] 19:23:16
BETTER.
I TALKED TO THE POLICE OFFICERS 

[Captioner] 19:23:19
MYSELF, AND THEY'RE SAYING THAT FREMONT IS A DESTINATION.


[Captioner] 19:23:22
IT'S A DESTINATION FOR HOMELESS PEOPLE.


[Captioner] 19:23:25
IT'S BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT WE'RE JUST GOING TO LET THEM STAY THERE AND WE'RE

[Captioner] 19:23:28
 NOT GOING TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.
AND THAT'S THE PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE.


[Captioner] 19:23:32
THESE PEOPLE HERE, THAT'S BEEN PARKED

[Captioner] 19:23:36
 ALONG THE GREEN PARK STREET, HAS BEEN THERE FOR

[Captioner] 19:23:39
 A LONG TIME, OVER A MONTH.
THEY DON'T MOVE THE CAR, THEY

[Captioner] 19:23:42
 LEAVE TRASH EVERYWHERE, I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW YOU GUYS ARE GOING

[Captioner] 19:23:45
 TO CLEAN UP THE STREETS.
IT BEING POLLUTED, YOU KNOW, WE CAN'T

[Captioner] 19:23:49
 DO ANY SWEEPING AT ALL.
TELL ME, HOW

[Captioner] 19:23:52
 ARE WE ACTUALLY GOING TO GET BETTER?
I'VE SEEN WHAT

[Captioner] 19:23:53
 HAPPENED IN THE IRVINGTON COMMUNITY CENTER.


[Captioner] 19:23:56
IT'S JUST GOTTEN WORSE.
IT DOESN'T GET BETTER.


[Captioner] 19:24:01
YOU KNOW, IN THE

[Captioner] 19:24:05
 FLYERS THEMSELVES, I HOPE YOU GUYS CAN SEE IT, THESE RVs ARE

[Captioner] 19:24:08
 PARKED NEXT TO THE PARKS, WHERE OUR KIDS PLAY,

[Captioner] 19:24:10
 SOCCER FIELDS WHERE OUR KIDS GO TO PLAY.


[Captioner] 19:24:13
YOU KNOW, THERE IS LIKE HOMELESS TENTS THAT'S

[Captioner] 19:24:17
 RIGHT BEHIND THE SOCCER GOALIE, THE GOAL OF THE

[Captioner] 19:24:19
 SOCCER.
SO IF SOMEBODY KICKS THE BALL OVER 

[Captioner] 19:24:22
THERE, WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO DO?
THEY'RE GOING TO CONFRONT A HOMELESS 

[Captioner] 19:24:25
PERSON IS WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO.
SOMEONE IS GOING TO PROBABLY GET 

[Captioner] 19:24:29
REALLY UPSET.
SO I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THERE'S 

[Captioner] 19:24:32
SEPARATE RULES FOR HOMELESS PEOPLE VERSUS NORMAL

[Captioner] 19:24:34
 PEOPLE.
I'M A LAW-ABIDING CITIZEN AND SO IS 

[Captioner] 19:24:38
THE RESIDENTS HERE.
WHEN OUR

[Captioner] 19:24:40
 VEHICLES ARE NOT REGISTERED, WHAT DO WE DO?


[Captioner] 19:24:43
WE GO AND PAY THE REGISTRATION.
OKAY?


[Captioner] 19:24:46
AND THEN -- AND WE MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE FOLLOWING THE LAW.


[Captioner] 19:24:49
THESE GUYS DON'T GET TO FOLLOW THE LAW, THEY GET TO DO WHATEVER THEY WANT.


[Captioner] 19:24:53
THEY CAN PARK THERE FOR OVER 72 HOURS, THEY

[Captioner] 19:24:55
 DON'T GET TOWED, THEY DON'T GET ANYTHING.


[Captioner] 19:24:58
WE WOULD GET A TICKET.
I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT -- WHY THEY HAVE 

[Captioner] 19:25:00
A SEPARATE LAW AND WE HAVE TO FOLLOW DIFFERENT TYPE OF LAW.


[Captioner] 19:25:03
SO THAT'S THE POINT I'M TRYING TO MAKE.


[Captioner] 19:25:06
TELL ME HOW IS IT GOING TO GET BETTER?
IT'S GETTING

[Captioner] 19:25:09
 WORSE.
START WITH ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR, IT'S 

[Captioner] 19:25:12
GOING TO ATTRACT MORE HOMELESS, OKAY?
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:25:16
>> Mr. Quintanilla: OUR NEXT SPEAKER

[Captioner] 19:25:20
 IS S ALIM FOLLOWED BY KELLY ABREU.


[Captioner] 19:25:28
>> GOOD EVENING, MAYOR, COUNCILMEMBERS.


[Captioner] 19:25:32
I'M BACK AGAIN WITH A PROPOSAL THAT I

[Captioner] 19:25:35
 HAD PROPOSED TWO WEEKS AGO REGARDING THE

[Captioner] 19:25:39
 GHETTO AREA

[Captioner] 19:25:42
 OF FREMONT BOULEVARD AND IRVINGTON.
SO I HAVE SUBMITTED

[Captioner] 19:25:45
 A LETTER TO THE DEVELOPMENT

[Captioner] 19:25:49
 MANAGER DAN, AND I WOULD LIKE TO GET A DIRECTION

[Captioner] 19:25:52
 ON HOW TO DEVELOP THIS

[Captioner] 19:25:56
 GHETTO AREA, WHICH

[Captioner] 19:26:00
 IS -- THE PARKING LOT AND THE CAR WASH ON IRVINGTON

[Captioner] 19:26:03
 ROAD AND FREMONT BOULEVARD.


[Captioner] 19:26:08
THIS CAN BE TURNED INTO, LIKE I SAID BEFORE,

[Captioner] 19:26:11
 LIKE A SANTANA ROW DEVELOPMENT.
I HAVE THE PEOPLE

[Captioner] 19:26:14
 WHO HAVE THE FUNDS WHO WILL DO

[Captioner] 19:26:17
 IT.
THEY DON'T WANT ANY MONEY FROM THE 

[Captioner] 19:26:20
CITY OR THE COUNTY OR THE STATE, SO I WOULD LIKE TO GET A DIRECTION

[Captioner] 19:26:23
 ON HOW TO MOVE THIS

[Captioner] 19:26:27
 PROJECT FORWARD, MAYBE THE BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT

[Captioner] 19:26:32
 MANAGER, THE CITY MANAGER, THE PLANNING DEPARTMENT AND THE CITY 

[Captioner] 19:26:35
COUNCIL CAN GUIDE US ON A

[Captioner] 19:26:38
 STEP-BY-STEP APPROACH TO CONVERT THIS WHOLE

[Captioner] 19:26:42
 BAD GHETTO AREA INTO

[Captioner] 19:26:45
 SOMETHING WHERE THE CITY BENEFITS.
THERE WILL BE 600

[Captioner] 19:26:49
 HOMES, SHOPS, UNDERGROUND PARKING, THE WHOLE

[Captioner] 19:26:51
 9 YARDS.
SO THAT IS ITEM NUMBER ONE.


[Captioner] 19:26:54
ITEM NUMBER TWO -- I MEAN, YOU'VE GOT TO THINK, I'VE BEEN

[Captioner] 19:26:57
 TALKING ABOUT THE FIVE ROADS FOR 10 YEARS

[Captioner] 19:27:01
 NOW, FREMONT WILL NOT BE A PASS-THROUGH CITY ANYMORE, IT WILL

[Captioner] 19:27:04
 BE A DESTINATION CITY.
THAT IS OUR GOAL,

[Captioner] 19:27:07
 WE SHOULD BEAUTIFY OUR CITY,

[Captioner] 19:27:10
 AND IT IS IMPORTANT

[Captioner] 19:27:14
 FOR THE GOVERNMENT, FOR YOU, CITY

[Captioner] 19:27:17
 COUNCILMEMBERS, THE STAFF, TO

[Captioner] 19:27:20
 UNDERSTAND THE OVERALL CONCEPT.
SO IF

[Captioner] 19:27:23
 SOMEBODY WILL CALL ME OR GUIDE ME, I WILL APPRECIATE IT.


[Captioner] 19:27:26
AND I WILL TAKE IT STEP BY STEP,

[Captioner] 19:27:29
 AND GET THIS THING GOING.
THAT IS ITEM NUMBER ONE.


[Captioner] 19:27:32
ITEM NUMBER TWO, THERE ARE FOUR PLACES ON

[Captioner] 19:27:36
 THIS AGENDA TODAY OF WORK THAT IS

[Captioner] 19:27:40
 BEING DONE WITH EXEMPTION OF

[Captioner] 19:27:43
 CEQA.
THE PROJECT THAT I'M WORKING ON,

[Captioner] 19:27:46
 ON CHAPEL WAY,

[Captioner] 19:27:49
 IS STOPPED, YEARS ARE GOING BY BECAUSE OF THE

[Captioner] 19:27:53
 CEQA REQUIREMENT.
WHY IS IT THAT THE CITY-OWNED

[Captioner] 19:27:56
 PROJECTS ARE EXEMPT FROM CEQA?
WHY IS

[Captioner] 19:27:59
 IT THAT PEOPLE WHO WANT TO DO SOMETHING CANNOT

[Captioner] 19:28:03
 DO IT BECAUSE ONE COMPANY DOES A CEQA

[Captioner] 19:28:06
 AND IT TAKES A YEAR JUST TO

[Captioner] 19:28:09
 GET THE APPROVAL?
PEOPLE ARE

[Captioner] 19:28:12
 LOSING MONEY.
THIS SHOULD BE A UNIFORM POLICY FOR 

[Captioner] 19:28:17
ALL PROJECTS UNDER THE NEW STATE LAW AND THE CEQA

[Captioner] 19:28:20
 LAW 1504,

[Captioner] 19:28:24
 1531, 1532, 1538.
SO PLEASE MAKE A UNIFORM

[Captioner] 19:28:25
 POLICY.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:28:29
>> Mr. Quintanilla: NEXT SPEAKER IS KELLY ABREU,

[Captioner] 19:28:33
 FOLLOWED BY LISA DANZ.


[Captioner] 19:28:38
>> THANK YOU.
IT SEEMS LIKE PEOPLE HAVE

[Captioner] 19:28:41
 A TUNNEL VISION, THEY ONLY LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THEIR OWN

[Captioner] 19:28:45
 BACKYARDS, AND THEY OFTENTIMES DON'T REALIZE WHAT'S

[Captioner] 19:28:48
 HAPPENING ON THE OTHER SIDE OF TOWN.


[Captioner] 19:28:53
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT GREEN PARK

[Captioner] 19:28:56
 DRIVE, THAT'S VERY SIMILAR, IT DIRECTLY

[Captioner] 19:28:58
 ANALOGOUS.
IT ALMOST EQUAL TO WEIBEL DRIVE.


[Captioner] 19:29:02
NOW, WEIBEL DRIVE, THAT IS NEAR MISSION

[Captioner] 19:29:06
 PEAK, AND THERE, THEY ALSO -- BY THE WAY,

[Captioner] 19:29:09
 GREEN PARK HAS NO HOUSING ON IT.
THERE'S NOBODY THERE WITH A MAILBOX,

[Captioner] 19:29:12
 A DRIVEWAY -- WELL, THE DRIVEWAYS GO OFF INTO A

[Captioner] 19:29:15
 DIFFERENT STREET.
THE GREEN PARK HAS

[Captioner] 19:29:19
 NO RESIDENCE DIRECTLY ON THERE,

[Captioner] 19:29:20
 NO FRONT DOORS.
WEIBEL, SAME THING.


[Captioner] 19:29:24
BUT WEIBEL IS FULLY PROTECTED.
IT HAS THE MISSION

[Captioner] 19:29:27
 PEAK RESIDENTIAL PERMIT PARKING ZONE.
WHY NOT DO THAT FOR

[Captioner] 19:29:30
 GREEN PARK DRIVE, HUH?
BECAUSE IT WOULD

[Captioner] 19:29:33
 BE UNIMAGINABLE.
POLICE WOULD NEVER SUGGEST THAT TO 

[Captioner] 19:29:36
YOU.
BECAUSE THEY ONLY DO IT FOR ONE 

[Captioner] 19:29:38
NEIGHBORHOOD.
THEY WOULD NEVER DO IT FOR EVERYONE.


[Captioner] 19:29:44
HOW ABOUT KATO ROAD?
KATO ROAD USED TO BE FULL OF

[Captioner] 19:29:45
 RVs.
NOW IT'S FULL OF BOULDERS.


[Captioner] 19:29:49
WHY NOT FILL YOUR ROAD, GREEN PARK DRIVE,

[Captioner] 19:29:51
 BUT BOULDERS EVERYWHERE.
YOU REMEMBER?


[Captioner] 19:29:54
THE BOULDER DIPLOMACY, WE CALL IT.
AND THAT WOULD ELIMINATE YOUR

[Captioner] 19:29:57
 RVs.
IT'S ALREADY DONE -- GO TO KATO ROAD, 

[Captioner] 19:30:00
TAKE A LOOK, COUNT THE RVs THERE.
YOU'LL COUNT ZERO.


[Captioner] 19:30:04
SO IT'S NOT THAT THE HOMELESS POPULATION HAS THEIR OWN

[Captioner] 19:30:07
 LAWS THAT TRAVEL WITH THE HOMELESS.
IT'S THAT THE DIFFERENT

[Captioner] 19:30:10
 NEIGHBORHOODS HAVE DIFFERENT LAWS THAT RESIDE WITH THE NEIGHBORHOOD.


[Captioner] 19:30:14
AND THIS NEIGHBORHOOD DOESN'T GET NO PROTECTION.


[Captioner] 19:30:19
AND THEN -- LET'S SEE.
OH, ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF

[Captioner] 19:30:22
 IRVINGTON.
IF YOU GO TO BAY STREET, BAY STREET 

[Captioner] 19:30:25
HAS A CITY-OWNED PARKING LOT THERE.
A LITTLE

[Captioner] 19:30:28
 PARKING LOT RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE NEXT TO THE HAIR SALON, YOU

[Captioner] 19:30:31
 KNOW, AND THAT'S FULL OF RVs, BECAUSE IT'S IN IRVINGTON.


[Captioner] 19:30:35
IF THERE WAS A CITY PARKING LOT IN MISSION

[Captioner] 19:30:38
 PEAK, THERE WOULD NEVER BE RVs ALL OVER THERE.


[Captioner] 19:30:42
SO YOU KNOW, GO TO MISSION PEAK, GO

[Captioner] 19:30:45
 TO -- DRIVE AROUND, COUNT HOW MANY RVs YOU FIND OUT THERE.


[Captioner] 19:30:48
AND YOU'LL FIND -- YOU WON'T FIND ANY, BECAUSE IT'S A

[Captioner] 19:30:51
 DIFFERENT SET OF LAWS.
YOU KNOW, YOUR PROPERTY

[Captioner] 19:30:54
 VALUES ARE GOING TO GO DOWN, BUT MISSION PEAK IS GOING TO

[Captioner] 19:30:58
 STAY UP.
THANKS TO THIS COUNCIL,

[Captioner] 19:31:01
 AND THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD

[Captioner] 19:31:04
 RESIDENTIAL PARKING -- PERMIT PARKING ZONE.


[Captioner] 19:31:08
THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF PROTECTION IS VERY

[Captioner] 19:31:10
 LIMITED.
DOESN'T INCLUDE IRVINGTON.


[Captioner] 19:31:14
IRVINGTON -- I'M STARTING TO WORRY THAT IRVINGTON IS

[Captioner] 19:31:17
 GOING TO, YOU KNOW, IS IN A RACE TO THE BOTTOM WITH

[Captioner] 19:31:21
 VARIOUS OTHER NEIGHBORHOODS, AND IRVINGTON MIGHT WIN IN GOING DOWN TO

[Captioner] 19:31:22
 THE BOTTOM.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:31:28
>> Mr. Quintanilla: OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS LISA DANZ.


[Captioner] 19:31:32
>> GOOD EVENING.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:31:36
THIS IS LISA DANZ FROM FREMONT FOR EVERYONE,

[Captioner] 19:31:39
 AND THOSE WHO REGULARLY ATTEND CITY COUNCIL MEETINGS

[Captioner] 19:31:42
 HAVE PROBABLY HEARD

[Captioner] 19:31:45
 US MAKE COMMENTS HERE.
I WANTED TO SHARE A QUICK UPDATE ABOUT 

[Captioner] 19:31:48
WHAT WE DO AND AN OPPORTUNITY TO GET

[Captioner] 19:31:50
 INVOLVED.
OUR MISSION IS THE FOLLOWING.


[Captioner] 19:31:53
FREMONT FOR EVERYONE ADVOCATE FOR INCLUSIVE

[Captioner] 19:31:57
 AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR OUR RESIDENTS AND ENSURES FREMONT IS IS WELCOMING

[Captioner] 19:32:00
 OF NEW NEIGHBORS WHILE REMAINING A WONDERFUL COMMUNITY FOR LIVING

[Captioner] 19:32:03
 CLOSER TO WORK, RAISING A FAMILY AND AGING IN PLACE,

[Captioner] 19:32:06
 A HOME FOR EVERYONE.
IN KEEPING WITH THAT MISSION WE 

[Captioner] 19:32:10
SUPPORT LONG TERM SOLUTIONS TO BUILD MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING

[Captioner] 19:32:13
 SUCH AS PROJECT HOMEKEY AND SUPPORT POLICIES TO MAKE

[Captioner] 19:32:15
 IT EASIER TO BUILD DENSE AND TRANSIT-ORIENTED HOUSING.


[Captioner] 19:32:19
WE ALSO, AS COMPLEMENTARY TO THAT,

[Captioner] 19:32:22
 SUPPORT RESOURCES TO ADDRESS THE IMMEDIATE NEEDS

[Captioner] 19:32:25
 OF OUR NEIGHBORS WHO ARE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS,

[Captioner] 19:32:28
 INCLUDING THE HOUSING NAVIGATION CENTER, AND SAFE PARKING.


[Captioner] 19:32:32
AND IF YOU BELIEVE IN THIS MISSION, I WOULD LIKE TO INVITE YOU TO

[Captioner] 19:32:35
 JOIN US AT OUR NEXT FREMONT FOR EVERYONE MEETING, WHICH IS GOING TO

[Captioner] 19:32:38
 BE THIS COMING THURSDAY, JULY 20TH,

[Captioner] 19:32:51
WAS TALKING ABOUT AND WANT TO WORK WITH US TO MAKE THEM HAPPEN, PLEASE DO JOIN

WE'VE BEEN MEETING ON ZOOM FOR A 

[Captioner] 19:32:56
WHILE.
AND THIS IS GOING TO BE OUR FIRST 

[Captioner] 19:32:58
IN-PERSON MEETING FOR QUITE A WHILE, SO WE'RE QUITE EXCITED.


[Captioner] 19:33:02
AND WE'RE ALSO GRATEFUL AND EXCITED TO

[Captioner] 19:33:05
 SHARE THAT HUMAN SERVICES SUZANNE

[Captioner] 19:33:08
 SHENFIL WILL BE A GUEST SPEAKER, PROVIDING AN UPDATE ON SAFE PARKING 

[Captioner] 19:33:12

[Captioner] 19:33:15
 SUPPORT.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME, AND THANKS 

[Captioner] 19:33:16
FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO SUPPORT OUR MISSION.


[Captioner] 19:33:20
>> Mr. Quintanilla: THAT WAS OUR LAST SPEAKER.


[Captioner] 19:33:25
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
AT THIS TIME, I'LL TURN IT

[Captioner] 19:33:28
 BACK TO THE COUNCIL, IF

[Captioner] 19:33:31
 THERE'S ANY OTHER COMMENTS BECAUSE WE CAN'T COMMENT -- I THINK THE CITY 

[Captioner] 19:33:34
MANAGER WANTED TO ADDRESS, THOUGH, SOME OF THE SPEAKERS BECAUSE THIS

[Captioner] 19:33:36
 IS -- SHE'S GOING TO SHARE A BRIEF STATEMENT ON THIS.


[Captioner] 19:33:39
>> City Mgr. Shackelford: YES, BECAUSE THE ITEM WASN'T AGENDIZED

[Captioner] 19:33:43
 AS THE MAYOR MENTIONED DURING HER OPENING OF PUBLIC

[Captioner] 19:33:46
 COMMENT, I WILL JUST MAKE A BRIEF STATEMENT ABOUT THE GREEN

[Captioner] 19:33:49
 PARK DRIVE MATTER.
AND THAT IS TO SAY THAT OUR

[Captioner] 19:33:53
 OFFICERS HAVE BEEN ENGAGING WITH THE RESIDENT IN

[Captioner] 19:33:56
 THAT AREA, AND WE'VE INCREASED OUR PATROLLING IN THE

[Captioner] 19:34:00
 AREA, AND OUR MOBILE EVALUATION TEAM IS

[Captioner] 19:34:03
 DOING INCREASED MONITORING AS WELL

[Captioner] 19:34:03
.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:34:11
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
BUT PLEASE NOTE THAT YOUR COMMENTS

[Captioner] 19:34:14
 HAVE BEEN HEARD AND THEN I KNOW THAT ALL THE

[Captioner] 19:34:16
 COUNCIL WILL BE FOLLOWING UP ON THIS TOO.


[Captioner] 19:34:21
SO NEXT ON OUR AGENDA ITEM THIS

[Captioner] 19:34:26
 EVENING IS OUR REGULARLY SCHEDULED ITEM, WHICH IS -- ACTUALLY

[Captioner] 19:34:29
 IT'S THE ITEMS THAT WE JUST PULLED.
WHICH

[Captioner] 19:34:32
 IS ITEM 2N

[Captioner] 19:34:34
 AND 2K.
BUT 2K COMES FIRST.


[Captioner] 19:34:37
SO I THINK THERE'S A SPEAKER ON 2K.


[Captioner] 19:34:39
ALBERTO?
>> Mr. Quintanilla: YES, WE HAVE ONE 

[Captioner] 19:34:41
SPEAKER FOR ITEM 2K.
>> Mayor Mei: ALSO THE COUNCILMEMBER.


[Captioner] 19:34:47
>> Vice Mayor Cox: AND ALSO MYSELF, 2K.


[Captioner] 19:34:50
>> Mayor Mei: FIRST IT'S THE SPEAKER WHO PULLED THE

[Captioner] 19:34:53
 ITEM AND I

[Captioner] 19:34:56
 BELIEVE THE OTHER PERSON WHO PULLED IT IS COUNCILMEMBER

[Captioner] 19:34:59
 CAMPBELL.
>> Mr. Quintanilla: OUR SPOK

[Captioner] 19:35:03
 SPEAKER IS LINDA

[Captioner] 19:35:05
 DULANEY.
>> GOOD EVENING, CITY COUNCIL, MADAME 

[Captioner] 19:35:08
MAYOR AND CITY STAFF.
MY NAME IS LINDA DULANEY.


[Captioner] 19:35:11
I'M HERE TO SPEAK TO YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT SOME INFORMATION THAT I'M NOT

[Captioner] 19:35:15
 SURE YOU'RE AWARE OF REGARDING

[Captioner] 19:35:18
 THE SCHOOL RESOURCE OFFICER PROGRAM.


[Captioner] 19:35:21
WE DID A LITTLE BIT OF RESEARCH RECENTLY, BEFORE

[Captioner] 19:35:25
 OUR SCHOOL BOARD MEETING, AND

[Captioner] 19:35:28
 WE INVESTIGATED THE SCHOOL RESOURCE OFFICER PROGRAMS AT

[Captioner] 19:35:32
 THE OTHER -- AT THE

[Captioner] 19:35:34
 OTHER 17 SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN ALAMEDA COUNTY.


[Captioner] 19:35:38
OF THOSE SCHOOL DISTRICTS

[Captioner] 19:35:42
 IN ALAMEDA COUNTY, TWO OF THEM ARE ONLY ELEMENTARY SO THEY

[Captioner] 19:35:45
 DON'T HAVE SROs.
THERE IS -- THERE

[Captioner] 19:35:48
 ARE NO STROAs IN

[Captioner] 19:35:53
 ALBANY, CASTRO VALLEY, HAYWARD,

[Captioner] 19:35:56
 OAKLAND, PIEDMONT, SAN LEANDRO OR SAN

[Captioner] 19:36:00
 LORENZO.
IN THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS OF

[Captioner] 19:36:03
 ALAMEDA, BERKELEY, DUBLIN, LIVERMORE,

[Captioner] 19:36:06
 NEWARK, AND PLEASANTON, THEY HAVE SRO

[Captioner] 19:36:09
 PROGRAMS AND THEIR SRO PROGRAMS ARE PAID FOR

[Captioner] 19:36:11
 100% BY THE CITY, NOT BY THE SCHOOL DISTRICT.


[Captioner] 19:36:16
THERE IS -- THERE WAS ONE IN ALAMEDA ACTUALLY BUT IT HAS BEEN

[Captioner] 19:36:19
 DISCONTINUED BUT IT WAS ALSO PAID FOR 100% BY THE CITY.


[Captioner] 19:36:23
OUTSIDE OF ALAMEDA COUNTY, THERE IS

[Captioner] 19:36:26
 A SRO PROGRAM AT SAN RAMON UNIFIED, AND

[Captioner] 19:36:30
 THEY PAY -- THE SCHOOL DISTRICT PAYS $1, AND THE CITY

[Captioner] 19:36:33
 PAYS THE REST.
AND IN

[Captioner] 19:36:36
 DANVILLE, THEY HAVE TWO OFFICERS AND ONE SUPERVISOR, AND THE DISTRICT

[Captioner] 19:36:39
 PAYS 500 -- $50,000 AND THE CITY PAYS THE REST.


[Captioner] 19:36:43
AND IN PALO ALTO, THEY DON'T HAVE ANY

[Captioner] 19:36:46
 SROs.
SO I'M WONDERING

[Captioner] 19:36:49
 WHY FREMONT PAYS 50%.
WHY DOES

[Captioner] 19:36:53
 FREMONT UNIFIED PAY 50% AND THE CITY OF

[Captioner] 19:36:56
 FREMONT ONLY PAYS 50%?
WHY IS IT SPLIT IN HALF LIKE THAT?


[Captioner] 19:36:59
WHY ISN'T THE CITY OF FREMONT PICKING UP THE MAJORITY OF THE COST?


[Captioner] 19:37:06
AND THE COST IS FOR ONE YEAR OVER

[Captioner] 19:37:10
 $2 MILLION FOR 6 OFFICERS.


[Captioner] 19:37:13
THAT IS

[Captioner] 19:37:18
 $342,187 PER OFFICER.
THAT'S SALARY AND BENEFITS.


[Captioner] 19:37:24
NOW, CONVENIENTLY, THERE WAS A LIST OF

[Captioner] 19:37:28
 SALARY RATES AS PART OF THIS INFORMATION ON

[Captioner] 19:37:32
 THE CONSENT CALENDAR, AND IT INDICATES

[Captioner] 19:37:36
 THAT EVEN -- A REGULAR POLICE OFFICER, IF

[Captioner] 19:37:39
 YOU TAKE HIS REGULAR SALARY AT

[Captioner] 19:37:43
 STEP 5 AND DOUBLE IT, THAT'S ONLY $302,000.


[Captioner] 19:37:48
$40,000 LESS THAN AN SRO.
EVEN THE

[Captioner] 19:37:52
 HIGHEST PAID POLICE OFFICER, 29 YEARS OF

[Captioner] 19:37:55
 EXPERIENCE, ONLY GETS $343,000.


[Captioner] 19:38:00
IF YOU DOUBLE HIS SALARY.


[Captioner] 19:38:03
I CAN'T IMAGINE WHY THE

[Captioner] 19:38:07
 FREMONT -- WHY IT'S COSTING THIS AMOUNT OF MONEY AND WHY THE CITY IS 

[Captioner] 19:38:09
NOT PICKING UP MORE OF THE COST.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:38:13
AT THIS TIME I'LL TAKE IT BACK TO THE COUNCILMEMBER WHO HAD

[Captioner] 19:38:15
 THE QUESTION, ALSO A COMMENT.
COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL.


[Captioner] 19:38:25
>> Councilmember Campbell: THANK YOU FOR THAT COMMENT.


[Captioner] 19:38:29
I KNOW I WATCHED THE VIDEO OF THE

[Captioner] 19:38:32
 FREMONT UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT MEETING AT THE TIME THAT

[Captioner] 19:38:36
 THEY WERE DELIBERATING ON THIS ITEM

[Captioner] 19:38:39
.
AND THERE WERE A COUPLE THINGS THAT 

[Captioner] 19:38:43
CAME UP THAT WERE -- THAT I THINK

[Captioner] 19:38:46
 THE COUNCIL NEEDS TO DISCUSS.


[Captioner] 19:38:49
ONE OF THEM IS THE COST.
THE SCHOOL

[Captioner] 19:38:53
 DISTRICT DID AGREE TO PAY 50% OF

[Captioner] 19:38:56
 THE COST OF SALARIES AND BENEFITS FOR THE SIX

[Captioner] 19:39:00
  OFFICERS.
IN ADDITION, THERE WAS A COMMENT

[Captioner] 19:39:03
 THAT THE CITY OF FREMONT WAS

[Captioner] 19:39:08
 BEING SUED FOR INAPPROPRIATELY

[Captioner] 19:39:11
 TAPING CHILDREN

[Captioner] 19:39:13
 AND THEIR ATTORNEYS DURING QUESTIONING.


[Captioner] 19:39:18
AND I HAD ASKED OUR CITY ATTORNEY TO PLEASE

[Captioner] 19:39:21
 BE ABLE TO COMMENT ON THE ACCURACY

[Captioner] 19:39:24
 OF ANY PROPOSED LITIGATION ON THAT ISSUE.


[Captioner] 19:39:33
>> Mayor Mei: IF OUR CITY ATTORNEY WOULD LIKE TO ANSWER.


[Captioner] 19:39:36
THANK YOU.
>> YES, TO

[Captioner] 19:39:39
 ADDRESS COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL'S SECOND QUESTION, TO MY KNOWLEDGE, THE 

[Captioner] 19:39:42
CITY HAS NOT BEEN SUED BY ANY REPRESENTATIVES OF ANY

[Captioner] 19:39:45
 MINORS ALLEGING THAT THE CITY RECORDED

[Captioner] 19:39:50
 IN-CUSTODY CONSULTATIONS

[Captioner] 19:39:52
 BETWEEN MINORS AND THEIR ATTORNEYS.
>> Councilmember Campbell: THANK YOU 

[Captioner] 19:39:55
FOR THAT CLARIFICATION.
I AM IN FULL SUPPORT OF THIS

[Captioner] 19:39:59
 MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING FOR

[Captioner] 19:40:03
 THE SAFETY OF NOT ONLY OUR OFFICERS AND

[Captioner] 19:40:06
 OUR COMMUNITY, FOR INCIDENCES THAT HAVE HAPPENED IN THE

[Captioner] 19:40:10
 PAST, AND ALSO FOR THE 35-PLUS

[Captioner] 19:40:13
 STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES AT FREMONT UNIFIED.


[Captioner] 19:40:16
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:40:18
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
NEXT IS VICE MAYOR COX.


[Captioner] 19:40:25
>> Vice Mayor Cox: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.


[Captioner] 19:40:28
I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE SURE, YOU KNOW, PUBLIC SAFETY IS OUR

[Captioner] 19:40:32
 NUMBER ONE HERE FOR THE CITY AND MAKING SURE

[Captioner] 19:40:35
 THAT ALL OF THOSE THAT ATTEND OUR

[Captioner] 19:40:39
 SCHOOL, THAT THEY ARE WELL PROTECTED AND PROTECTING THE VOICE THAT CAN

[Captioner] 19:40:40
 BE HEARD AND THE VOICE THAT CANNOT BE HEARD.


[Captioner] 19:40:45
AND I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A LITTLE BIT

[Captioner] 19:40:48
 MORE EXPLAINING ON THE SRO PROGRAM IN

[Captioner] 19:40:52
 REGARDS TO DIVERSION, AND HOW THAT IT'S

[Captioner] 19:40:55
 ADDRESSED, IF IT'S GOING ON STUDENTS'

[Captioner] 19:40:58
 RECORDS, AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S 16 ARRESTS THAT

[Captioner] 19:41:02
 WERE MADE OVER THE LAST YEAR BASED ON SOME OF

[Captioner] 19:41:06
 THE DATA THAT CAME OUT OF THE SCHOOL BOARD MEETING, AND

[Captioner] 19:41:09
 I DO UNDERSTAND THAT

[Captioner] 19:41:12
 THE SCHOOL BOARD TRUSTEES DID APPROVE

[Captioner] 19:41:15
 THE AGREEMENT.
I JUST WOULD LIKE TO UNDERSTAND A 

[Captioner] 19:41:18
LITTLE BIT MORE ON HOW DIVERSION

[Captioner] 19:41:24
 -- AND THERE ALSO SEEMS TO BE THAT THERE APPEARED IN SOME

[Captioner] 19:41:27
 COMMENTS THAT HISPANIC AND

[Captioner] 19:41:31
 AFROAMERICAN STUDENTS TENDED TO BE MORE LIKELY TO BE

[Captioner] 19:41:35
 ARRESTED OR IN THE CASE OF COUNTING IN THE

[Captioner] 19:41:38
 NUMBERS OF 16 ARRESTS, SO I WOULD

[Captioner] 19:41:41
 LIKE TO HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE EXPLANATION ON THAT FROM OUR POLICE

[Captioner] 19:41:45
 CHIEF, SEAN WASHINGTON.


[Captioner] 19:41:51
>> Mayor Mei: WELCOME, CHIEF.


[Captioner] 19:42:07
>> GOOD AFTERNOON, EVERYONE.


[Captioner] 19:42:11
MAYOR, CITY COUNCIL, CITY MANAGER AND

[Captioner] 19:42:14
 THE REST OF CITY STAFF.
THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME

[Captioner] 19:42:18
 TO COME AND ADDRESS SOME OF

[Captioner] 19:42:22
 THE CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN EXPRESSED

[Captioner] 19:42:26
 REGARDING ARREST DATA AND THOSE TYPE OF

[Captioner] 19:42:29
 MATTERS.
SO TO YOUR

[Captioner] 19:42:33
 POINT, VICE MAYOR, LAST YEAR, OUR

[Captioner] 19:42:37
 SROs ISSUED 16 NOTICES TO

[Captioner] 19:42:40
 APPEAR, AND IT'S LISTED IN OUR SRO

[Captioner] 19:42:44
 ANNUAL REPORT UNDER "ARRESTS."
I WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT

[Captioner] 19:42:47
 TO EXPLAIN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A

[Captioner] 19:42:50
 PHYSICAL ARREST AND WHAT WE ISSUE, WHICH IS A NOTICE TO APPEAR.


[Captioner] 19:42:53
A PHYSICAL ARREST IS WHEN WE ACTUALLY TAKE SOMEONE INTO CUSTODY

[Captioner] 19:42:57
 AND TRANSPORT THAT INDIVIDUAL TO A

[Captioner] 19:43:01
 CUSTODY FACILITY.
OF

[Captioner] 19:43:04
 THE 16 ARRESTS, I'M

[Captioner] 19:43:08
 NOT AWARE -- I THINK WE HAD ONE THAT WAS PHYSICALLY

[Captioner] 19:43:11
 TAKEN INTO CUSTODY.
THE REST WERE ISSUED NOTICES TO

[Captioner] 19:43:14
 APPEAR.
SO WE DIDN'T TAKE THE JUVENILES INTO 

[Captioner] 19:43:16
CUSTODY AND PHYSICALLY TAKE THEM DOWN TO A DETENTION FACILITY.


[Captioner] 19:43:20
NOW, OF THOSE 16 ARRESTS

[Captioner] 19:43:24
, 12 WERE ISSUE

[Captioner] 19:43:27
ED OR REFERRED TO OUR DIVERSION PROGRAM.


[Captioner] 19:43:30
AS A DEPARTMENT, IT IS OUR PRIORITY TO ENSURE

[Captioner] 19:43:34
 THAT, YES, THERE IS ACCOUNTABILITY UNDER THE

[Captioner] 19:43:37
 LAW, HOWEVER, WE ARE DEALING WITH JUVENILES AND YOUTH, AND SO WE WANT

[Captioner] 19:43:40
 TO GIVE THEM EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO AVOID THE

[Captioner] 19:43:43
 CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM, AND SO 12 OUT OF 16

[Captioner] 19:43:46
 OF THOSE NOTICES TO APPEAR WERE

[Captioner] 19:43:50
 REFERRED TO OUR DIVERSION PROGRAM, AND SO IN

[Captioner] 19:43:54
 LIEU OF HAVING A

[Captioner] 19:43:57
 RECORD OR BEING CAUGHT UP IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE

[Captioner] 19:44:00
 SYSTEM, THEY'RE ABLE TO RECEIVE SUPPORT,

[Captioner] 19:44:03
 COUNSELING, COMMUNITY SERVICE, THOSE TYPE OF THINGS, AND

[Captioner] 19:44:06
 THEN THAT PARTICULAR OFFENSE DOES NOT GO ON THEIR RECORD.


[Captioner] 19:44:11
I THINK YOU BROUGHT UP THE POINT ABOUT

[Captioner] 19:44:15
 MAYBE THE RACE OF THE INDIVIDUAL THAT

[Captioner] 19:44:19
 ARE BEING ARRESTED AS WELL.
AND SO IT'S IMPORTANT

[Captioner] 19:44:22
 TO UNDERSTAND THAT AS WE RESPOND, WE'RE VERY

[Captioner] 19:44:26
 RESPONSIVE AS SROs TO CRIMES THAT ARE BEING COMMITTED

[Captioner] 19:44:29
 ON CAMPUSES.
SO DIFFERENT THAN SOME OF

[Captioner] 19:44:32
 THE PATROL TACTICS THAT ARE OUT THERE FOR OUR PATROL

[Captioner] 19:44:34
 OFFICERS, WE'RE REACTIVE IN THE SCHOOLS.


[Captioner] 19:44:38
SO OFTENTIMES, OUR ADMINISTRATORS ARE CALLING US TO AN INCIDENT,

[Captioner] 19:44:42
 OUR PRINCIPALS, TO DEAL WITH SOMETHING

[Captioner] 19:44:45
 THAT IS AT A LEVEL THAT IT REQUIRES A SCHOOL

[Captioner] 19:44:48
 RESOURCE OFFICER TO HANDLE.
SOMEONE WITH A KNIFE ON CAMPUS, OR

[Captioner] 19:44:51
 A SIGNIFICANT FIGHT WHERE THERE'S

[Captioner] 19:44:55
 INJURIES OR SOME OTHER MAJOR ILLEGAL ACTIVITY IN WHICH A

[Captioner] 19:44:57
 LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER'S PRESENCE IS APPROPRIATE.


[Captioner] 19:45:01
AND SO WE CAN'T

[Captioner] 19:45:02
 CONTROL THE MAKEUP OR WHO THAT PERSON IS.


[Captioner] 19:45:06
WE ARE BEING VERY RESPONSIVE.


[Captioner] 19:45:09
AND SO YOU KNOW, IF WE HAVE ONE

[Captioner] 19:45:12
 ARREST, AND THAT PERSON HAPPENS TO BE AFRICAN AMERICAN, THEN

[Captioner] 19:45:13
 100% OF OUR ARRESTS ARE AFRICAN AMERICAN.


[Captioner] 19:45:17
SO WE CAN'T CONTROL THAT DATA.
WE'RE JUST BEING RESPONSIVE.


[Captioner] 19:45:23
I'M SENSITIVE TO THE PERCEPTION,

[Captioner] 19:45:26
 HOWEVER, AND SO WE EVERY YEAR, FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF

[Captioner] 19:45:30
 YEARS, HAVE HAD PARTNERSHIPS

[Captioner] 19:45:34
 WITH CIVIL RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THE NAACP AND

[Captioner] 19:45:39
 OTHER ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE SUPPORTIVE

[Captioner] 19:45:42
 OF JUVENILE JUSTICE.
AND IT IMPORTANT FOR ME AS THE

[Captioner] 19:45:45
 CHIEF TO HAVE THAT RELATIONSHIP, AND PROVIDE

[Captioner] 19:45:48
 THIS DATA IN THIS REPORT TO THOSE ORGANIZATIONS EVERY SINGLE YEAR TO

[Captioner] 19:45:52
 ENSURE THAT WE'RE TALKING THROUGH ANY

[Captioner] 19:45:53
 REAL OR PERCEIVED ISSUES THAT ARE THERE.


[Captioner] 19:45:57
SO I'M VERY AWARE OF MAYBE THE PERCEPTION THAT'S OUT

[Captioner] 19:46:00
 THERE, THE NUMBERS AND THE STATISTICS AND THOSE TYPE OF

[Captioner] 19:46:03
 THINGS.
BUT WE TAKE MEASURES AND WE TAKE IT 

[Captioner] 19:46:06
VERY SERIOUSLY THROUGH OUR POLICIES AND ACTIONS TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE

[Captioner] 19:46:10
 ADMINISTERING CRIMINAL JUSTICE IN A VERY FAIR AND EQUITABLE

[Captioner] 19:46:14
 WAY.


[Captioner] 19:46:18
>> Vice Mayor Cox: ARE ANY OF THOSE -- YOU HAD MENTIONED THAT

[Captioner] 19:46:21
 ONE ARREST.
WOULD THAT ONE ARREST BE REPORTED INTO 

[Captioner] 19:46:24
WHAT IS CONSIDERED THE WEEKLY REPORT THAT WE GET

[Captioner] 19:46:27
 EACH WEEK ON HOW THINGS ARE HAPPENING IN OUR

[Captioner] 19:46:30
 CITY?
>> NOT NECESSARILY, BECAUSE JUVENILE 

[Captioner] 19:46:33
RECORDS ARE -- THEY HAVE A HIGHER LEVEL OF CONFIDENTIALITY FOR OBVIOUS

[Captioner] 19:46:36
 REASONS.
AND SO IT MAY BE CAPTURED IN THE 

[Captioner] 19:46:41
GENERAL DATA, BUT YOU KNOW, WE KEEP THE ARREST AND THE

[Captioner] 19:46:44
 STATISTICS ON THE JUVENILES, WE TRY TO KEEP

[Captioner] 19:46:46
 THOSE SEPARATE FOR CONFIDENTIALITY REASONS.


[Captioner] 19:46:49
>> Vice Mayor Cox: OKAY.
SO BASICALLY

[Captioner] 19:46:53
 IF ONE IS -- SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT 16 -- THERE WERE

[Captioner] 19:46:56
 NOTICES TO APPEAR, THERE WERE 12 OF THEM, WHICH MEANS THAT THERE

[Captioner] 19:46:59
 WERE NO ARRESTS, NOT

[Captioner] 19:47:03
 ON ANY RECORD, IT WAS JUST A NOTICE THAT WAS ABLE --

[Captioner] 19:47:06
 FOR THE INDIVIDUAL TO

[Captioner] 19:47:09
 PARTICIPATE IN THE DIVERSION PROGRAM?
>> YES,

[Captioner] 19:47:12
 SO HOW IT WORKS IS, WE WILL -- IF

[Captioner] 19:47:15
 WE'RE CALLED AND THERE IS A VIOLATION OF A

[Captioner] 19:47:19
 LAW, SIGNIFICANT VIOLATION OF THE LAW, THE SCHOOL RESOURCE OFFICER

[Captioner] 19:47:22
 WILL THEN HAVE COMMUNICATION WITH THE PARENTS, THE PARENTS HAVE TO

[Captioner] 19:47:25
 SIGN THE NOTICE TO APPEAR, COME DOWN TO THE SCHOOL, AND

[Captioner] 19:47:29
 THEY BASICALLY

[Captioner] 19:47:32
 -- THAT NOTICE IS THEN SENT TO THE DIVERSION PROGRAM IN WHICH THEY

[Captioner] 19:47:35
 ARE EVALUATED IF THEY'RE A GOOD CANDIDATE FOR

[Captioner] 19:47:37
 DIVERSION.
AND 90% OF THE TIME, THEY ARE.


[Captioner] 19:47:41
IT DEPENDS ON THE OFFENSE, RIGHT?
IF THERE'S

[Captioner] 19:47:44
 A MAJOR OFFENSE INVOLVING MAJOR VIOLENCE, THAT

[Captioner] 19:47:47
 PERSON IS LIKELY NOT GOING TO QUALIFY FOR THAT.


[Captioner] 19:47:50
IF THERE'S A DEMAND TO ARREST A

[Captioner] 19:47:54
 PERSON AND FOR WHATEVER REASON WE NEED TO REMOVE THEM FROM THE CAMPUS,

[Captioner] 19:47:56
 THEY MAY NOT BE ELIGIBLE FOR IT AS WELL.


[Captioner] 19:48:00
IF THEY HAVE MULTIPLE INCIDENTS INVOLVING THE

[Captioner] 19:48:03
 SAME TYPE OF BEHAVIOR, THAT MAY BE A

[Captioner] 19:48:07
 CRITERIA WHERE DIVERSION HASN'T WORKED IN THE PAST AND SO THEY ARE REFERRED

[Captioner] 19:48:10
 TO THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM.
BUT THE VAST

[Captioner] 19:48:13
 MAJORITY OF THE TIME, AND IT IS OUR POLICY

[Captioner] 19:48:17
 TO TRY DIVERSION FIRST, BECAUSE WE KNOW

[Captioner] 19:48:20
 THAT KIDS MAKE MISTAKES, WE ALL MAKE MISTAKES, BUT OUR

[Captioner] 19:48:23
 YOUTH, IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE SUPPORT THEM AS THEY DEVELOP IN THEIR

[Captioner] 19:48:27
 MATURITY AND GIVE THEM AN OPPORTUNITY TO CORRECT THE

[Captioner] 19:48:29
 BEHAVIOR.
>> Councilmember Cox: AND YOU ALSO 

[Captioner] 19:48:31
MENTIONED THE NAACP HAS REVIEWED YOUR REPORT AS WELL.


[Captioner] 19:48:34
DID THEY APPROVE THE REPORT?
>> THAT IS CORRECT.


[Captioner] 19:48:38
THEY DID APPROVE THE REPORT.
LAST YEAR THEY

[Captioner] 19:48:41
 WERE VERY COMPLIMENTARY OF OUR PROGRAM, AND THE STEPS

[Captioner] 19:48:44
 THAT WE PROACTIVELY -- IN FACT, I THINK THE

[Captioner] 19:48:47
 NAACP PRESIDENT SAID WE WERE THE ONE AND ONLY

[Captioner] 19:48:51
 POLICE DEPARTMENT THAT HAS EVER PROACTIVELY REACHED OUT

[Captioner] 19:48:53
 TO THE NAACP TO LOOK AT THEIR SRO PROGRAM.


[Captioner] 19:48:56
>> Vice Mayor Cox: THANK YOU.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE 

[Captioner] 19:48:58
CLARIFICATIONS.
>> THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:49:01
>> Mayor Mei: COUNCILMEMBER KENG.
>> Councilmember Keng: THANK

[Captioner] 19:49:02
 YOU, MAYOR.
HELLO, CHIEF.


[Captioner] 19:49:05
>> HI.
>> Councilmember Keng: I'M WONDERING 

[Captioner] 19:49:08
IF WHETHER THE CHIEF OR OTHER STAFF WOULD BE ABLE TO SHARE ANY HISTORY

[Captioner] 19:49:12
 OR CLARIFICATION ON ONE OF THE PUBLIC

[Captioner] 19:49:16
 COMMENTERS' QUESTION HOW IT CAME

[Captioner] 19:49:19
 TO -- FOR THE BUDGET, HOW IT CAME TO FOR THE CITY AND THE SCHOOL DISTRICT

[Captioner] 19:49:23
 TO SHARE 50/50 WHEN MOST OTHER CITIES

[Captioner] 19:49:26
 ARE -- THE PROGRAM IS PAID MOSTLY BY THE

[Captioner] 19:49:29
 CITY?
>> I COULD -- I COULD --

[Captioner] 19:49:30
 WELL, LET'S SEE HERE.
THERE WE GO.


[Captioner] 19:49:33
I CAN CERTAINLY GIVE YOU MY HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE, BEING

[Captioner] 19:49:37
 HERE FOR 26 YEARS.
THIS SRO PROGRAM GOES BACK

[Captioner] 19:49:40
 OVER I THINK THREE DECADES, SO IT DEFINITELY

[Captioner] 19:49:43
 GOES BACK BEYOND MY YEARS.
BUT IT ALWAYS BEEN

[Captioner] 19:49:46
 A PARTNERSHIP.
UNDERSTANDING THAT

[Captioner] 19:49:50
 RESOURCES, NOT ONLY IN THIS CITY BUT THROUGHOUT OTHER

[Captioner] 19:49:53
 JURISDICTIONS, ARE LIMITED.
AND WE ALL HAVE A COLLECTIVE

[Captioner] 19:49:56
 DESIRE TO DO ALL WE CAN TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF

[Captioner] 19:49:59
 OUR YOUTH AND OUR KIDS, RIGHT?
AND

[Captioner] 19:50:03
 SO I THINK WE ALL SHARE THAT RESPONSIBILITY, AND OUR COMMITMENT 

[Captioner] 19:50:06
BECAUSE OF THIS PARTNERSHIP HAS BEEN TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE ABLE

[Captioner] 19:50:10
 TO PROVIDE ON A VERY CONSISTENT MANNER THIS RESOURCE TO

[Captioner] 19:50:13
 THE SCHOOL DISTRICT.
WE

[Captioner] 19:50:17
 HAVE 230, SOME SAY 250,000

[Captioner] 19:50:21
 RESIDENTS IN THIS COMMUNITY, AND WE HAVE TO SHARE THOSE

[Captioner] 19:50:24
 RESOURCES AND DISTRIBUTE THOSE RESOURCES IN A VERY RESPONSIBLE

[Captioner] 19:50:28
 MANNER.
WHILE HAVING THE COST

[Captioner] 19:50:31
 SHARE AGREEMENT HAS ENABLED US TO DEVOTE RESOURCES

[Captioner] 19:50:34
 TO THE SCHOOLS IN A WAY THAT'S BEEN EFFECTIVE OVER

[Captioner] 19:50:37
 THE DECADES.
AND SO IT GOES BACK TO THE

[Captioner] 19:50:40
 PARTNERSHIP, THE INITIAL PARTNERSHIP PRIOR TO HAVING SRO

[Captioner] 19:50:44
 SROs, WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IS A PATROL OFFICER WOULD

[Captioner] 19:50:47
 COME IN AND HANDLE WHATEVER INCIDENT THAT IS OCCURRING ON CAMPUS.


[Captioner] 19:50:51
BUT WHAT WE FOUND AND WHAT SRO PROGRAMS HAVE FOUND OVER

[Captioner] 19:50:54
 THE YEARS IS THAT THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY

[Captioner] 19:50:58
 EFFECTIVE, BECAUSE OFFICERS ASSIGNED TO THE SCHOOL HAVE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT 

[Captioner] 19:51:01
OF SPECIALIZED TRAINING, UNDERSTANDING, THEY UNDERSTAND THE MISSION

[Captioner] 19:51:04
 AND THE GOAL OF THE SRO

[Captioner] 19:51:07
 PROGRAM IS TO HELP GUIDE AND HELP CHILDREN, VERSUS, YOU

[Captioner] 19:51:11
 KNOW, PUNISH CHILDREN OR SEND KIDS INTO

[Captioner] 19:51:14
 THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM.


[Captioner] 19:51:19
SO HAVING BEEN INVOLVED WITH THE SRO PROGRAM FOR MANY YEARS

[Captioner] 19:51:22
 AND STUDYING THE HISTORY BEHIND IT, I KNOW

[Captioner] 19:51:25
 THAT UNDER CHIEF STECKLER'S LEADERSHIP, THAT WAS SOME OF

[Captioner] 19:51:28
 THE PRIMARY REASONS WHY WE ENTERED INTO THIS AGREEMENT THAT HAS BEEN

[Captioner] 19:51:31
 IN PLACE FOR MANY DECADES.
>> Councilmember

[Captioner] 19:51:34
 Keng: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
JUST ONE QUICK FOLLOW-UP

[Captioner] 19:51:38
 QUESTION.
HAS THERE BEEN ANY RECENT TRAINING

[Captioner] 19:51:41
 DUE TO SOME OF THE CONCERNS

[Captioner] 19:51:44
 THAT OTHER COMMUNITY MEMBERS HAVE FOR THE SRO

[Captioner] 19:51:47
 PROGRAM?
>> YES, OUR TRAINING GOES ABOVE AND 

[Captioner] 19:51:49
BEYOND.
EVERY YEAR WE HAVE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF 

[Captioner] 19:51:51
TRAINING THAT THE SROs HAVE TO GO THROUGH.


[Captioner] 19:51:56
DE-ESCALATION, CRITICAL INCIDENT TRAINING

[Captioner] 19:51:59
 OR CIT, WE EVEN

[Captioner] 19:52:03
 HAVE PROFESSIONALS COME IN AND TALK

[Captioner] 19:52:06
 ABOUT THE MINDSET OF CHILDREN AND THE DIVERSITY

[Captioner] 19:52:08
 OF CHILDREN AND ALL OF THOSE OTHER SORTS OF THINGS.


[Captioner] 19:52:12
SO THAT'S ONGOING.
WHENEVER WE HAVE A NEW SRO

[Captioner] 19:52:15
 THAT COMES ON BOARD, WE

[Captioner] 19:52:18
 ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE THAT BASIC TRAINING, AND THEN IT'S

[Captioner] 19:52:21
 EVERY YEAR, WE REFRESH THAT TRAINING

[Captioner] 19:52:24
 AND I KNOW THAT OUR TRAINING PROGRAM GOES ABOVE AND BEYOND ANY

[Captioner] 19:52:28
 OTHER SRO PROGRAM THAT'S OUT THERE, AND THAT PROBABLY BRINGS

[Captioner] 19:52:31
 ME TO YOUR OTHER POINT THAT I FAILED TO ADDRESS, IS

[Captioner] 19:52:34
 THAT, YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE COMMUNITY MEMBERS

[Captioner] 19:52:38
 TALKED ABOUT, OTHER SRO PROGRAM, AND MAYBE THE FINANCIAL AGREEMENT

[Captioner] 19:52:42
 THERE.
AND YES, THERE ARE OTHER MODELS

[Captioner] 19:52:45
 OUT THERE BUT THERE ARE ALSO OTHER SCHOOL

[Captioner] 19:52:48
 SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT HAVE THEIR OWN POLICE FORCE THAT THEY FUND AS WELL.


[Captioner] 19:52:51
SO IT'S BASED ON ENSURING THAT

[Captioner] 19:52:54
 THE QUALITY AND THE CONSISTENCY

[Captioner] 19:52:58
 OF SERVICE, WE'RE ABLE TO PROVIDE AS

[Captioner] 19:53:01
 A MID SIZED POLICE DEPARTMENT IN THE BAY

[Captioner] 19:53:04
 AREA.
AND YOU KNOW,

[Captioner] 19:53:07
 I TRULY BELIEVE THAT WHATEVER ARRANGEMENT THAT A

[Captioner] 19:53:10
 CITY HAS WITH THEIR LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICT WILL

[Captioner] 19:53:13
 WORK FOR THEM.
BUT THIS HAS WORKED FOR US OVER MANY

[Captioner] 19:53:17
 DECADES, AND SO THAT'S WHY I THINK THAT THIS IS

[Captioner] 19:53:20
 STILL A VERY BENEFICIAL PROGRAM FOR OUR CITY, OUR COMMUNITY AND OUR

[Captioner] 19:53:23
 SCHOOLS.
>> Councilmember Keng: THANK YOU VERY 

[Captioner] 19:53:26
MUCH FOR YOUR SHARING.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:53:30
NEXT IS COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN.
>> Councilmember Kassan: THANK YOU, 

[Captioner] 19:53:33
CHIEF.
COULD YOU SHARE A BIT MORE ON WHY IT 

[Captioner] 19:53:36
WAS THAT FOUR OF THE STUDENTS WERE NOT ABLE TO

[Captioner] 19:53:39
 BE PUT INTO THE DIVERSION PROGRAM?
>> YEAH, I WOULD

[Captioner] 19:53:42
 HAVE TO RESEARCH THAT SPECIFIC

[Captioner] 19:53:46
 CASE, AND LET ME SEE IF I HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF INFORMATION

[Captioner] 19:53:49
 HERE WITHOUT

[Captioner] 19:53:52
 GIVING TOO MUCH DETAIL.
LET'S SEE HERE.


[Captioner] 19:53:59
I'M VERY AWARE THAT WE WANT TO BE PROTECTIVE OF

[Captioner] 19:54:03
 THE JUVENILE

[Captioner] 19:54:06
S' CONFIDENTIALITY.
I JUST HAD IT HERE.


[Captioner] 19:54:10
LET'S SEE.


[Captioner] 19:54:14
THERE WAS ONE SITUATION

[Captioner] 19:54:19
 WHERE

[Captioner] 19:54:22
 THERE WAS A -- THERE WAS A BOMB THREAT.


[Captioner] 19:54:26
THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT BOMB THREAT, THERE WAS AN ACTUAL THREAT TO

[Captioner] 19:54:30
 THE SCHOOL.
IT

[Captioner] 19:54:32
 WAS -- IT WAS SIGNIFICANT, IT WAS IN THE NEWS.


[Captioner] 19:54:35
THAT DIDN'T REALLY MEET

[Captioner] 19:54:37
 THE CRITERIA FOR THAT SIGNIFICANT CASE.


[Captioner] 19:54:40
THAT'S ONE EXAMPLE.
THAT

[Captioner] 19:54:44
 OCCURRED EARLIER IN THE SCHOOL YEAR.
IN

[Captioner] 19:54:47
 ANOTHER SITUATION, THERE WAS

[Captioner] 19:54:50
 A STUDENT THAT WAS ARRESTED, AND

[Captioner] 19:54:53
 THEY WERE ARRESTED ACTUALLY BY A PATROL OFFICER AND THE CRIME

[Captioner] 19:54:57
 WAS SIGNIFICANT, AND THE PATROL OFFICER REFERRED TO THE JUVENILE

[Captioner] 19:55:00
 JUSTICE SYSTEM.
SO THAT'S ANOTHER EXAMPLE.


[Captioner] 19:55:04
BUT THOSE ARE SOME OF THE EXAMPLES THAT I HAVE FOR

[Captioner] 19:55:07
 YOU THAT WOULD LIKELY NOT MAKE

[Captioner] 19:55:10
 SOMEONE ELIGIBLE.
OBVIOUSLY IF THERE WAS LIKE A SERIOUS 

[Captioner] 19:55:13
INJURY OR A HOMICIDE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT

[Captioner] 19:55:17
, DIVERSION, RIGHT, IS NOT GOING TO APPLY

[Captioner] 19:55:20
 IN THOSE CASES.


[Captioner] 19:55:23
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
NEXT IS COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN.


[Captioner] 19:55:25
>> Councilmember Salwan: THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR.


[Captioner] 19:55:29
YEAH, I SUPPORT THE SRO PROGRAM.


[Captioner] 19:55:32
I GRADUATED FROM HIGH SCHOOL A FEW YEARS BEFORE THE SRO PROGRAM

[Captioner] 19:55:36
 STARTED, AND I DO KNOW THAT WE HAD A LOT MORE

[Captioner] 19:55:40
 AGGRESSION, VIOLENCE, FIGHTING, AND A LOT OF

[Captioner] 19:55:43
 TIMES THE TEACHERS, PRINCIPALS AND OTHER PEOPLE WERE

[Captioner] 19:55:45
 INTERVENING TO TRY TO SOLVE A LOT OF THE ISSUES.


[Captioner] 19:55:50
AND DEFINITELY A LOT MORE BULLYING, JUST A LOT MORE STUFF GOING ON

[Captioner] 19:55:53
 THAT PROBABLY NEVER REALLY MADE TO THE ATTENTION OF

[Captioner] 19:55:56
 MOST OF THE POLICE DEPARTMENT OR ANY OF

[Captioner] 19:55:59
 THE FOLKS, AND SO

[Captioner] 19:56:02
 WHEN I SEE MY KIDS, THEY DON'T HAVE A LOT OF THE ISSUES WE HAD.


[Captioner] 19:56:07
BACK THEN, YOU HAD TO BE TOUGH, BECAUSE SOMEONE WAS ALWAYS

[Captioner] 19:56:10
 MESSING WITH YOU FOR SOMETHING.
BUT NOW, WITH

[Captioner] 19:56:14
 THE SRO, ANYTHING THAT HAPPENS, THE STUDENTS CAN IMMEDIATELY TELL

[Captioner] 19:56:18
 THE SRO, THEY'LL GO TALK TO THE FOLKS,

[Captioner] 19:56:21
 DE-ESCALATE, GET THINGS WORKED OUT.
SO WHAT BETTER SITUATION CAN WE

[Captioner] 19:56:24
 HAVE THAN SOMEBODY RIGHT THERE WHO CAN INTERVENE,

[Captioner] 19:56:27
 WHO CAN GUIDE THE STUDENTS, TELL THEM WHAT'S

[Captioner] 19:56:30
 RIGHT, WHAT'S WRONG, IN CASE THERE'S AN EMERGENCY,

[Captioner] 19:56:33
 THEY CAN BE A POINT OF CONTACT TO, YOU KNOW, REACH

[Captioner] 19:56:37
 OUT TO THE POLICE, FIRE, EMERGENCY

[Captioner] 19:56:40
 RESPONSE.
SO I THINK THAT

[Captioner] 19:56:44
 IT'S A VERY VALUABLE RESOURCE, THEY CALL IT A RESOURCE OFFICER, THEY

[Captioner] 19:56:47
 PROVIDE RESOURCES TO THE STUDENTS, TO THE TEACHERS, TO THE

[Captioner] 19:56:49
 ADMINISTRATORS.
AND SO I THINK THIS IS A GREAT PROGRAM 

[Captioner] 19:56:53
THAT'S WORKING WELL.
IT ALSO IS A GREAT INTERFACE

[Captioner] 19:56:56
 BETWEEN THE POLICE AND STUDENTS.
AND SO IT

[Captioner] 19:56:59
 KIND OF MAKES STUDENTS COMFORTABLE, TALKING TO THE POLICE OFFICERS.


[Captioner] 19:57:04
SO I THINK THIS IS A GREAT PROGRAM, AND I STRONGLY SUPPORT

[Captioner] 19:57:07
 WHAT WE'RE DOING.
FREMONT HAS OUR OWN WAY OF DOING

[Captioner] 19:57:10
 THINGS, AND I THINK WE HAVE DONE A GREAT JOB AND WE NEED TO CONTINUE 

[Captioner] 19:57:12
THAT.
SO I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS EFFORT.


[Captioner] 19:57:15
>> THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:57:18
NEXT IS COUNCILMEMBER SHAO.


[Captioner] 19:57:20
>> Councilmember Shao: THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR.


[Captioner] 19:57:23
I WAS ON THE SCHOOL BOARD FROM 2014 TO 2018,

[Captioner] 19:57:26
 SO I HAD FOUR YEARS OF

[Captioner] 19:57:30
 TIME IN FRONT ROW WITNESSING HOW

[Captioner] 19:57:33
 USEFUL AND HOW EFFECTIVE THIS SRO

[Captioner] 19:57:37
 PROGRAM HAS BEEN.
SMAIVET,

[Captioner] 19:57:40
AS A MATTER OF FACT, I REALIZE THAT

[Captioner] 19:57:43
 ON PAPER, IT'S 50/50, THE CITY AND

[Captioner] 19:57:47
 THE SCHOOL BOARD SPLIT THE EXPENSE, BUT THERE ARE

[Captioner] 19:57:50
 SO MANY HIDDEN COST

[Captioner] 19:57:54
S ON THE CITY SIDE, FOR EXAMPLE,

[Captioner] 19:57:57
 THE OVERTIME, THE TRAINING, EQUIPMENT

[Captioner] 19:58:00
, AS WELL AS MANY OTHER THINGS.


[Captioner] 19:58:03
SO THE PERCENTAGE

[Captioner] 19:58:06
 THAT THE CITY HAD BEEN PAYING FOR COULD

[Captioner] 19:58:09
 BE WELL ABOVE

[Captioner] 19:58:12
 50%, AND TO SOME POINT, IT'S MORE LIKE ONE-THIRD

[Captioner] 19:58:16
 TO TWO THIRDS IN THAT KIND OF RATIO.


[Captioner] 19:58:19
I BELIEVE IN THIS PROGRAM BECAUSE I'VE WITNESSED

[Captioner] 19:58:23
 ITS ACHIEVEMENT, AND OF COURSE INCLUDING THE AWARDS

[Captioner] 19:58:26
 THAT THIS PROGRAM HAS WON.
AND I

[Captioner] 19:58:29
 REALLY APPRECIATE THIS MODEL.
THIS MODEL MEANS THAT

[Captioner] 19:58:32
 BOTH SIDES ARE VESTED

[Captioner] 19:58:36
 IN THIS PROGRAM, SO WE ALL HAVE OUR

[Captioner] 19:58:39
 RESPONSIBILITIES AND WE ALL CAN

[Captioner] 19:58:42
 MAKE OUR OWN CONTRIBUTIONS.
SO THIS

[Captioner] 19:58:46
 ACTUALLY IS THE BEAUTY OF THIS PROGRAM, THE ADVANTAGE AND STRENGTH OF

[Captioner] 19:58:49
 THIS PROGRAM, AND THIS MIGHT BE THE VERY

[Captioner] 19:58:53
 REASON WHY WE WON SO MANY

[Captioner] 19:58:56
 PRIZES IN THE PAST.
SO I AM VERY SUPPORTIVE TO THIS 

[Captioner] 19:58:59
PROGRAM, AND SUPPORTIVE TO THIS MEMO.
THANK

[Captioner] 19:59:01
 YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:59:03
I KNOW THERE'S SOME OTHER COUNCILMEMBERS, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE 

[Captioner] 19:59:06
MAKING THE MOTION, BUT I WAS GOING TO -- DO YOU HAVE A

[Captioner] 19:59:09
 FOLLOW-UP QUESTION BECAUSE I WAS GOING TO MAKE MY STATEMENTS TOO.


[Captioner] 19:59:12
>> Councilmember Campbell: I HAVE ONE QUICK FOLLOW-UP QUESTION AND

[Captioner] 19:59:14
 THEN I'D BE WILLING TO MAKE A MOTION TO APPROVE.


[Captioner] 19:59:16
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY.
I HAVE SOME COMMENTS.


[Captioner] 19:59:20
>> Councilmember Campbell: IS THE REPORT -- I HEARD ABOUT

[Captioner] 19:59:23
 AN ANNUAL REPORT, IT WASN'T INCLUDED ON THIS DOCUMENT.


[Captioner] 19:59:26
IS IT AVAILABLE ON THE WEBSITE ANYWHERE OR CAN YOU SEND IT OFF TO THE

[Captioner] 19:59:28
 COUNCIL SO WE CAN TAKE A LOOK AT THAT ANNUAL REPORT?


[Captioner] 19:59:31
>> CERTAINLY, CERTAINLY WE CAN DO THAT AND MAKE THAT AVAILABLE.


[Captioner] 19:59:35
WE RECENTLY PROVIDED THAT ANNUAL REPORT, I BELIEVE IT

[Captioner] 19:59:38
 WAS MAYBE A MONTH OR MONTH AND A HALF AGO TO THE SCHOOL

[Captioner] 19:59:41
 DISTRICT AS WELL.
SO WE WILL DEFINITELY MAKE THAT 

[Captioner] 19:59:43
AVAILABLE TO THE --
>> Councilmember Campbell: TO THE 

[Captioner] 19:59:44
COUNCIL?
>> TO THE COUNCIL.


[Captioner] 19:59:45
>> Councilmember Campbell: THANK YOU SO MUCH.


[Captioner] 19:59:48
THAT WOULD BE VERY BENEFICIAL.
SO I WOULD LIKE, MAYOR MEI, TO

[Captioner] 19:59:51
 GO AHEAD AND MAKE A TO APPROVE.
>> Mayor Mei: I

[Captioner] 19:59:54
 WAS GOING TO MAKE SOME COMMENTS BUT I SEE

[Captioner] 19:59:58
 A MOTION AND SECOND BY COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN BUT I

[Captioner] 19:59:59
 HAVE SOME COMMENTS TOO.
>> Councilmember Campbell: I'M DONE, 

[Captioner] 20:00:01
THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: I JUST WANT TO COMMENT 

[Captioner] 20:00:03
THAT I DO THINK THAT THIS PROGRAM IS VERY IMPORTANT.


[Captioner] 20:00:06
I'VE SEEN IT FROM VERY DIFFERENT LENSES.


[Captioner] 20:00:09
I'VE HAD THE PRIVILEGE AND OPPORTUNITY TO WORK

[Captioner] 20:00:13
 ALONGSIDE ONE OF OUR FORMER COLLEAGUES HERE ON THE COUNCIL WHEN I

[Captioner] 20:00:16
 WAS A PARENT IN THE COMMUNITY, AND INVOLVED

[Captioner] 20:00:19
 IN PTA, AND I THOUGHT IT WAS VERY IMPORTANT TO HAVE

[Captioner] 20:00:22
 THAT RESOURCE.
DID ALSO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SERVE 

[Captioner] 20:00:26
ON THE BOARD PREVIOUSLY AND HAD SEEN A LOT OF THE

[Captioner] 20:00:29
 DISCUSSION ABOUT DISCIPLINE AND DIFFERENT WAYS THAT WE COULD PARTNER

[Captioner] 20:00:32
 FOR DIVERSION AND I THINK THAT THAT IS IMPORTANT TO BE ABLE TO

[Captioner] 20:00:35
 PROVIDE DIFFERENT RESOURCES

[Captioner] 20:00:39
 AND PROGRAMS, AND I KNOW THAT OUR YOUTH AND FAMILY SERVICES WORKS

[Captioner] 20:00:42
 VERY CLOSELY WITH EVERYTHING FROM THE ELEMENTARY ALL THE WAY TO THE HIGH 

[Captioner] 20:00:44
SCHOOLS IN TERMS OF TRYING TO OUTREACH AND SUPPORT TO THE FAMILIES.


[Captioner] 20:00:48
I ALSO APPRECIATE, I KNOW THAT SINCE YOU'VE COME IN

[Captioner] 20:00:52
 THAT YOU'VE ALSO ADDED AND ENHANCED AND ADDED A YOUTH

[Captioner] 20:00:53
 ADVISORY COUNCIL, WHICH I THINK IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY.


[Captioner] 20:00:58
I RECOGNIZE THE CHALLENGES THAT WE FACED IN THE PAST AND SOME OF THE

[Captioner] 20:01:01
 QUESTIONS PEOPLE HAD IN TERMS OF JUST THE PERCEPTION, AND THE ADAPTIONS THAT

[Captioner] 20:01:04
 WE'VE MADE IN TERMS OF CHANGING FROM THE UNIFORM TO HAVING POLO

[Captioner] 20:01:07
 SHIRTS, HAVING THE CARS CLEARLY

[Captioner] 20:01:11
 MARKED AND ALSO JUST IN TERMS OF THE CONTINUED

[Captioner] 20:01:15
 OUTREACH AND IT'S A POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP IN WORKING WITH

[Captioner] 20:01:17
 THE STUDENTS.
SO I'M VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THIS 

[Captioner] 20:01:19
PROGRAM.
I DO AGREE AND CONCUR WITH 

[Captioner] 20:01:22
COUNCILMEMBER SHAO THAT THERE'S COSTS THAT PEOPLE DON'T ALWAYS SEE BECAUSE

[Captioner] 20:01:25
 WE MAY ENCAPSULATE SOME OF THOSE INTO OTHER AREAS SUCH AS OUR

[Captioner] 20:01:28
 TRAINING.
AND I ALSO

[Captioner] 20:01:32
 WANTED TO COMMEND -- I KNOW THAT WE WERE

[Captioner] 20:01:35
 RECOGNIZED ABOUT -- I THINK ABOUT A YEAR AGO

[Captioner] 20:01:38
 FOR NATIONALLY HAVING ONE OF THE BEST PROGRAMS, BECAUSE WE DID

[Captioner] 20:01:42
 MAKE THE ADOPTIONS AND CHANGES THAT WHEN WE HEARD FROM THE COMMUNITY

[Captioner] 20:01:45
 MEMBERS, IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE, AND I KNOW THAT IN THAT 

[Captioner] 20:01:48
RELATIONSHIP WITH NAACP, THAT HAS BEEN AN ONGOING EFFORT, AS WELL

[Captioner] 20:01:51
 AS WITH COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS, AND I WOULD HOPE THAT IT'S ONE THAT

[Captioner] 20:01:54
 WE CONTINUE TO CHAMPION AND WORK ON AS WE MOVE FORWARD TO ENSURE

[Captioner] 20:01:57
 THAT EVERYONE FEELS COMFORTABLE WITH THE PROGRAMS AND THEN AT THE

[Captioner] 20:02:01
 CLARIFICATIONS AS TO WHAT MAY --

[Captioner] 20:02:04
 PERHAPS HAVING A CLARIFICATION ON THE REPORT SAYING THAT WHILE IT'S LISTED

[Captioner] 20:02:07
 AS AN ARREST, THOSE WERE NOT ALL ARRESTS, AND TO HAVE

[Captioner] 20:02:10
 THAT CLARIFICATION OR ASTERISK OR SOMETHING THAT EXPLAINS WHAT HAPPENED

[Captioner] 20:02:12
 WOULD BE HELPFUL.
AND I THINK THAT'S MY ONLY OTHER 

[Captioner] 20:02:14
COMMENT.
WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND AND 

[Captioner] 20:02:17
COUNCILMEMBER COX -- OR VICE MAYOR COX, DID YOU HAVE SOMETHING ELSE?


[Captioner] 20:02:20
>> Vice Mayor Cox: I WAS JUST GOING TO SAY HOW POSITIVE, AS I

[Captioner] 20:02:23
 VISITED A COUPLE OF THE SCHOOLS AND JUST POP IN, ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY

[Captioner] 20:02:26
 HAVE GAMES, AND I'VE NOTICED THAT THERE'S A

[Captioner] 20:02:30
 POSITIVE -- VERY POSITIVE ATTRACTION

[Captioner] 20:02:34
 THAT THE YOUNG PEOPLE COME UP TO THE RESOURCE OFFICERS AND THEY HANG OUT 

[Captioner] 20:02:37
AND JUST TALK.
AND I SEE THE SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS, I 

[Captioner] 20:02:40
SEE THE TEACHERS, AND I JUST WANT TO SAY HOW

[Captioner] 20:02:44
 POSITIVE OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS OR THREE YEARS THAT

[Captioner] 20:02:47
 THE EVOLUTION HAS CHANGED AND THERE'S

[Captioner] 20:02:50
 BEEN A LOT OF POSITIVE INTERACTIONS THAT I'VE SEEN FIRSTHAND THAT I

[Captioner] 20:02:54
 REALLY APPLAUD THE ONES THAT YOU HAVE PUT

[Captioner] 20:02:57
 AND PLACED AT THE SCHOOLS THAT IT SEEMS TO BE A GREAT

[Captioner] 20:03:01
 FIT, AND CERTAINLY WHEN I SEE STUDENTS FLOCKING AROUND AND

[Captioner] 20:03:04
 ASKING THE POLICE OFFICERS TO SHOW SOME OF THEIR

[Captioner] 20:03:07
 MOVES, THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S VERY POSITIVE, THAT

[Captioner] 20:03:11
 THEY HAVE MADE TO ANOTHER DEEPER LEVEL

[Captioner] 20:03:14
 OF RESPECT AND ALSO A SENSE THAT THEY KNOW THERE'S

[Captioner] 20:03:17
 SOMEBODY THERE THAT THEY CAN TALK TO.
SO I JUST WANTED TO APPLAUD THE

[Captioner] 20:03:21
 WHOLE PROGRAM, AND JUST MENTION FIRSTHAND THAT

[Captioner] 20:03:23
 I'VE SEEN IT FROM VISITING SOME OF THE SCHOOLS.


[Captioner] 20:03:26
>> THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:03:29
WE HAVE A MOTION BY COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL AND A SECOND BY COUNCILMEMBER 

[Captioner] 20:03:30
SALWAN.
PLEASE VOTE.


[Captioner] 20:03:39
THE MOTION PASSES WITH THE MAJORITY AND

[Captioner] 20:03:40
 COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN VOTING NAY.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:03:47
NEXT -- THANK YOU, CHIEF.
AND THANK YOU FOR ALL

[Captioner] 20:03:50
 THE SPEAKERS.
NEXT ON THIS ITEM I BELIEVE THERE WAS

[Captioner] 20:03:52
 AN ITEM 2N AS IN NANCY THAT WAS PULLED.


[Captioner] 20:03:54
>> Mr. Quintanilla: YES, WE HAVE THREE SPEAKER CARDS.


[Captioner] 20:03:58
THE FIRST SPEAKER IS NARIN

[Captioner] 20:04:02
 AMADI FOLLOWED BY JOHN HINDS.


[Captioner] 20:04:06
>> HELLO.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.


[Captioner] 20:04:10
GOOD EVENING TO EVERYONE.


[Captioner] 20:04:26
NOT QUITE SURE WHETHER THIS WILL WORK OR NOT, BUT YEAH.


[Captioner] 20:04:29
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR

[Captioner] 20:04:33
 INCLUDING THIS VALLEJO

[Captioner] 20:04:35
 MILLS HISTORICAL PARK SITE DEVELOPMENT PLAN.


[Captioner] 20:04:40
IN THE CONSENT CALENDAR ITEM

[Captioner] 20:04:42
.
SO JUST -- I HAVE SOME THINGS TO TALK 

[Captioner] 20:04:46
ABOUT THIS.
IT'S GREAT THAT WE ARE DOING

[Captioner] 20:04:49
 SOMETHING TO THIS PARTICULAR PARK,

[Captioner] 20:04:53
 BEING SEEN THE WAY IT IS CURRENTLY.
BUT WHEN I

[Captioner] 20:04:56
 LOOKED AT THE PLAN, THE DEVELOPMENT PLAN,

[Captioner] 20:04:59
 I HAVE A FEW SUGGESTIONS, AND QUESTIONS

[Captioner] 20:05:02
 AS WELL.
SO IT'S GREAT THAT WE ARE

[Captioner] 20:05:05
 INCLUDING SOME DOG PARKS HERE.


[Captioner] 20:05:08
AND PARKING LOT AND THEN THERE ARE

[Captioner] 20:05:13
 LIKE FOUR

[Captioner] 20:05:16
 PICKLEBALL COURTS.
MY SUGGESTION WILL BE

[Captioner] 20:05:19
 TO BASICALLY INCREASE THE PARKING LOTS,

[Captioner] 20:05:22
 RIGHT NOW IT'S LIKE 23 PARKING SPOTS ARE CURRENTLY BEING

[Captioner] 20:05:25
 INCLUDED IN THIS PLAN.
SO WHY CAN'T WE INCREASE IT A

[Captioner] 20:05:29
 LOT MORE THAN THIS?


[Captioner] 20:05:32
AND INSTEAD OF HAVING THE PICKLEBALL COURTS LIKE

[Captioner] 20:05:36
 REDUCE THE DOG PARK WHICH IS CURRENTLY LIKE 41,000 SQUARE

[Captioner] 20:05:39
 FEET, TO MAYBE 20, 25,000, AND

[Captioner] 20:05:42
 THEN REMAINING ALLOCATED TO CHILDREN'S PARK, BECAUSE IT'S

[Captioner] 20:05:45
 A PARK.
SO WHEN WE SEE PARK LIKE WHEN WE SAY

[Captioner] 20:05:49
 PARK, WE EXPECT KIDS TO BE PLAYING IN IT BUT THERE

[Captioner] 20:05:52
 IS NOTHING THERE FOR KIDS TO PLAY.
ESPECIALLY WHEN PARENTS TAKE THE

[Captioner] 20:05:55
 DOGS, MAYBE THERE IS A CHANCE THAT THEY TAKE THEIR KIDS AS WELL AND THEN

[Captioner] 20:05:58
 ON A SIDELINE IF THERE IS A CHILDREN'S PARK WITH SWINGS,

[Captioner] 20:06:02
 ALL THOSE THINGS THAT WE HAVE IN

[Captioner] 20:06:05
 ELIZABETH LAKE, CENTRAL PARK OR ANY OTHER PLACES IN GENERAL, IT

[Captioner] 20:06:08
 WOULD BE HELPFUL.
SO THAT'S ONE SUGGESTION.


[Captioner] 20:06:11
AND ALSO THERE IS A REASON WHY I AM ASKING TO INCREASE THE

[Captioner] 20:06:15
 PARKING SPACES.


[Captioner] 20:06:18
WE CURRENTLY HAVE ONLY LIKE VERY LIMITED PARKING SPACES IN

[Captioner] 20:06:22
 ALAMEDA CREEK TRAIL STAGING AREA.


[Captioner] 20:06:26
WE ALSO HAVE A PLAN

[Captioner] 20:06:30
 ANYWAY TO DEVELOP THE NILES CANYON

[Captioner] 20:06:33
 ROAD INTO A TRAIL

[Captioner] 20:06:36
 FROM STAGING AREA TO SUNOL, WHETHER IT'S

[Captioner] 20:06:39
 RECOGNIZED OR NOT IS A DIFFERENT THING BECAUSE IT'S 200 TO 300 MILLION

[Captioner] 20:06:42
 PROJECT BASED ON SIX YEARS AGO BUDGET, BUT

[Captioner] 20:06:46
 FOR THAT --

[Captioner] 20:06:50
 -- THE ALAMEDA

[Captioner] 20:06:53
 STAGING AREA PLACE BUT GIVEN THAT IT'S NOT EVEN GOING TO BE

[Captioner] 20:06:57
 SUFFICIENT FOR THAT AND FOR THIS AND IT MAY BE HELPFUL TO INCREASE THAT

[Captioner] 20:07:00
 PARKING AREA OVER THERE BECAUSE RIGHT NOW ON THE WEEKENDS IF WE SEE THERE 

[Captioner] 20:07:03
ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO COME THERE TO ENJOY IN THE CREEK,

[Captioner] 20:07:07
 AND THEN WHATEVER THAT WE HAVE FOR CREEK

[Captioner] 20:07:10
 STAGING AREA THAT PARKING AREA IS NOT EVEN SUFFICIENT AT THIS TIME AND

[Captioner] 20:07:13
 THEY ALWAYS PARK IN THE OLD CANYON ROAD, SO IT MAY BE HELPFUL TO

[Captioner] 20:07:16
 INCREASE THE PARKING INSTEAD OF

[Captioner] 20:07:19
 PICKLEBALL COURTS.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:07:22
>> Mr. Quintanilla: NEXT SPEAKER IS JOHN HINDS FOLLOWED

[Captioner] 20:07:24
 BY KELLY ABREU.
>> HELLO, EVERYONE.


[Captioner] 20:07:30
TONIGHT'S COMMENT WAS BROUGHT TO YOU BY THE LETTER S

[Captioner] 20:07:34
.
I THINK SOMEONE ELSE IS GOING TO

[Captioner] 20:07:37
 ELABORATE.
SO ENJOY THE BREAK.


[Captioner] 20:07:40
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:07:46
>> Mr. Quintanilla: KELLY ABREU, FOLLOWED BY KEITH PARKER ON ZOOM.


[Captioner] 20:08:01
>> SO

[Captioner] 20:08:05
, THE PARK'S

[Captioner] 20:08:08
 NAME VALLEJO MILLS

[Captioner] 20:08:12
, IN THE INTEREST OF CONSISTENCY, I THINK

[Captioner] 20:08:15
 THAT THE PARK NAME SHOULD BE CHANGED

[Captioner] 20:08:18
 TO VALLEJO MILL.
THAT WOULD BE CONSISTENT WITH

[Captioner] 20:08:22
 VALLEJO MILL ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.
OTHERWISE EVERYONE IS GOING TO BE 

[Captioner] 20:08:25
CONFUSED AND THE LITTLE KIDDIES ARE GOING TO --

[Captioner] 20:08:28
 OR WHATEVER.
IT'S JUST INSANE TO HAVE TWO DIFFERENT

[Captioner] 20:08:32
 NAMING CONVENTIONS

[Captioner] 20:08:35
 IN BAJA, CALIFORNIA, THEY HAVE LA

[Captioner] 20:08:39
 MOLINA V EJA.


[Captioner] 20:08:42
IF THEY WANTED TO DO WHAT YOU'RE DOING, THEY WOULD

[Captioner] 20:08:45
 CALL IT LES

[Captioner] 20:08:49
 MOLINOS VEJOS.
IT'S A BIG DIFFERENCE IN SPANISH.


[Captioner] 20:08:52
ANYWAY, THERE'S NO NEED TO CONFUSE PEOPLE.


[Captioner] 20:08:56
JUST -- BY THE WAY, THE RAILROAD HAD IT AS VALLEJO

[Captioner] 20:08:58
 MILL.
BUILDING 23 PARKING SPACES.


[Captioner] 20:09:00
ARE YOU GOING TO CHARGE FOR THOSE PARKING SPACES?


[Captioner] 20:09:04
I HEARD PEOPLE ON THIS COUNCIL, A COUNCILMEMBER SAID THAT WE

[Captioner] 20:09:08
 HAD TO HAVE -- THE

[Captioner] 20:09:11
 PARK DISTRICT SHOULD START CHARGING FOR PARKING AND THAT FREE PARKING

[Captioner] 20:09:14
 WAS BAD AT PARKS.
HOW ABOUT AS FOR WHAT THE KIDDIES CAN

[Captioner] 20:09:17
 DO AT THE PARK, THEY CAN GO RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET, THEY'RE BUILDING A

[Captioner] 20:09:20
 PLACE WHERE THEY'LL PROBABLY SELL THEM SLURPS OR

[Captioner] 20:09:27
 SLURPEE S AT THE GAS STATION.


[Captioner] 20:09:29
HOW ABOUT THE RESTROOMS YOU'RE PUTTING IN HERE?


[Captioner] 20:09:32
I HEARD ON

[Captioner] 20:09:36
 NOVEMBER OF 2022, THE DIRECTOR

[Captioner] 20:09:39
 OF PARKS AND RECREATION OF THIS CITY TOLD

[Captioner] 20:09:42
 YOUR COUNCIL THAT STAFF WOULD

[Captioner] 20:09:46
 OPPOSE ANY RESTROOM IMPROVEMENTS AT MISSION PEAK, AND YOU'RE PUTTING IN

[Captioner] 20:09:49
 RESTROOMS HERE?
WHY DON'T YOU PUT IN THE -- WHY DON'T

[Captioner] 20:09:52
 YOU JUST SIT BACK AND LET OTHER PEOPLE PAY FOR THE

[Captioner] 20:09:55
 RESTROOMS AT MISSION PEAK?
LET THE PARK DISTRICT IMPROVE

[Captioner] 20:09:58
 THE RESTROOMS.
WHY ARE YOU STANDING IN

[Captioner] 20:10:01
 THE WAY OF RESTROOMS AND WHAT IS THIS

[Captioner] 20:10:05
 HYPOCRISY?
WE HEARD A MOMENT AGO

[Captioner] 20:10:08
 ABOUT THE SANITATION PROBLEMS ON THE STREETS OF GREEN PARK IN IRVINGTON.


[Captioner] 20:10:12
I'D LIKE TO REMIND YOU OF --

[Captioner] 20:10:15
 THIS CITY WAS ACTUALLY HONORED TO RECEIVE A VISIT FROM

[Captioner] 20:10:18
 MODI OF INDIA, PRIME MINISTER OF INDIA.


[Captioner] 20:10:21
YOU KNOW WHY I'M SUCH A BIG FAN?


[Captioner] 20:10:25
MODI INSTALLED TOILETS.


[Captioner] 20:10:28
THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS IN HIS POLITICAL POLICY BUT HE DID INSTALL

[Captioner] 20:10:32
 TOILETS.
AND FOR THE STAFF, FOR

[Captioner] 20:10:35
 THE POLITICIANS, FOR

[Captioner] 20:10:39
 THE RESIDENTS OF FREMONT TO MAKE TOILETS INTO A

[Captioner] 20:10:42
 POLITICAL ISSUE AT MISSION PEAK AND THEN SAY OH, OF COURSE WE'RE GOING TO 

[Captioner] 20:10:46
PUT THEM IN AT OUR OWN PARK HERE AT VALLEJO MILL, SUCH

[Captioner] 20:10:49
 I PO KRA SEE.
I THINK WE NEED TO TAKE A

[Captioner] 20:10:51
 LESSON FROM MODI.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:10:55
>> Mr. Quintanilla: OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS KEITH PARKER ON ZOOM FOLLOWED BY

[Captioner] 20:10:58
 SHARON VENTURA.


[Captioner] 20:11:04
>> HI THERE.
I WANTED TO SPEAK TONIGHT ON THE 

[Captioner] 20:11:07
PROPOSED UPDATE TO THE VALLEJO MILLS PARK AND AS WE ALL

[Captioner] 20:11:11
 KNOW, VALEO MILLS OCCUPIES A

[Captioner] 20:11:13
 BEAUTIFUL SPOT IN FREMONT, RIGHT THERE IN THE ENTRANCE TO NILES CANYON.


[Captioner] 20:11:16
IT'S AN INCREDIBLY SCENIC LOCATION

[Captioner] 20:11:19
 SHOWCASED BY THE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE

[Captioner] 20:11:21
 THAT TAKE PICTURES AMONG THE WILDFLOWERS.


[Captioner] 20:11:24
IT REALLY IS A HIDDEN GEM, AND

[Captioner] 20:11:28
 UNFORTUNATELY THAT PARTICULAR GEM HAS LOST SOME OF ITS

[Captioner] 20:11:31
 LUSTER OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS, HAVING BEEN LARGELY TAKEN OVER BY A 

[Captioner] 20:11:34
NUMBER OF UNHOUSED PEOPLE.
IT'S QUITE A SIGHT, WELCOMING VISITORS 

[Captioner] 20:11:37
TO OUR CITY AS THEY EXIT THE CANYON, ROWS OF

[Captioner] 20:11:41
 DERELICT RVs, SPRAWLS OF TENTS, PILES OF

[Captioner] 20:11:44
 REFUSE STREWN ABOUT.
LET'S NOT FORGET ABOUT THE

[Captioner] 20:11:48
 ALL TOO FREQUENT -- NOW IN FAIRNESS, THE CITY HAS

[Captioner] 20:11:51
 TAKEN PERIODIC STEPS TO REMEDIATE THE ISSUE, PUTTING IN DUMPSTERS FOR

[Captioner] 20:11:55
 WASTE DISPOSAL, OCCASIONALLY CLEANING THE PARK OUT AND

[Captioner] 20:11:58
 SO ON.
ONLY TO SEE THE RESIDENTS RETURN

[Captioner] 20:12:01
 SHORTLY THEREAFTER.
AND SO NOW HERE

[Captioner] 20:12:04
 WE ARE WITH A PLAN TO PUT IN A DOG PARK AND

[Captioner] 20:12:07
 PICKLEBALL COURTS.
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON THE TABLE

[Captioner] 20:12:10
 TO ENHANCE AND IMPROVE THIS PARK, MAKING IT BETTER

[Captioner] 20:12:13
 FOR ALL OF FREMONT.
SO THE OBVIOUS QUESTION BECOMES, IS

[Captioner] 20:12:17
 THIS PART OF A COORDINATED PLAN TO TRANSITION THE PEOPLE WHO

[Captioner] 20:12:19
 ARE RESIDING THERE TO SOME OTHER FACILITY OR LOCATION?


[Captioner] 20:12:22
HAS THIS BEEN THOUGHT THROUGH AND IS THERE A PLAN TO ENSURE THAT THIS

[Captioner] 20:12:26
 NATURALLY SCENIC SPOT ONCE AGAIN BECOMES A PLACE THAT RESIDENTS

[Captioner] 20:12:29
 CAN GO TO AND ENJOY, GET SOME EXERCISE,

[Captioner] 20:12:32
 BE OUTSIDE WITH FRIENDS AND FAMILIES, DOING THE VERY THINGS PEOPLE

[Captioner] 20:12:35
 ARE SUPPOSED TO DO IN PARKS BECAUSE THE AVERAGE CITIZEN CAN DO NONE OF 

[Captioner] 20:12:39
THAT THERE RIGHT NOW.
A SHORT DISTANCE AWAY IS

[Captioner] 20:12:41
 THE HISTORIC NURSERY PARK.
THIS WAS RECENTLY REDONE AND THE CITY 

[Captioner] 20:12:45
HAS DONE A PHENOMENAL JOB OF -- THAT PARK WHICH BEFORE

[Captioner] 20:12:48
 ITS MAKEOVER WAS A HAVEN FOR DRUG DEALERS INTO A SAFE AND

[Captioner] 20:12:51
 SECURE PLACE FOR PEOPLE TO ENJOY.
IT IS A FREMONT SUCCESS STORY.


[Captioner] 20:12:55
I HOPE THERE IS A THOUGHTFUL INTELLIGENT PLAN IN PLACE THAT WILL 

[Captioner] 20:12:58
ENSURE THE SAME SUCCESS FOR THIS PARK.
I HOPE THERE IS A

[Captioner] 20:13:01
 PLAN THAT COMPASSIONATELY RELOCATES THE PEOPLE THAT ARE LIVING THERE,

[Captioner] 20:13:04
 AND DOESN'T JUST SHUFFLE THEM TO SOME OTHER PART OF THE

[Captioner] 20:13:07
 CITY.
NOW IT'S NOT CLEAR FROM THE AGENDA 

[Captioner] 20:13:10
MATERIALS IF THERE IS SUCH A PLAN.
AND IF THERE ISN'T,

[Captioner] 20:13:13
 THEN DON'T TAKE ON THIS PROJECT UNTIL THERE IS SUCH A PLAN IN PLACE.


[Captioner] 20:13:17
IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO THIS, AND TO BE CLEAR, I THINK YOU

[Captioner] 20:13:21
 SHOULD, DO IT WITH CLEARLY DEFINED GOALS IN

[Captioner] 20:13:24
 A WAY TO MEASURE AND ENSURE SUCCESS.
BECAUSE WE ALL WANT THIS TO

[Captioner] 20:13:25
 BE A SUCCESS.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:13:30
>> Mr. Quintanilla: OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS SHARON VENTURA.


[Captioner] 20:13:37
>> HI.
THANK YOU, KEITH,

[Captioner] 20:13:40
 FOR YOUR ELOQUENT WORDS.


[Captioner] 20:13:44
I'D LIKE TO KNOW IF ANYBODY ON THE CITY COUNCIL

[Captioner] 20:13:47
 KNOWS WHERE

[Captioner] 20:13:52
 WHERE VALLEJO PARK IS.
I'VE SEEN IT RECENTLY ON

[Captioner] 20:13:55
 ADS FOR THE CITY OF FREMONT FOR THE HAPPIEST PLACE ON

[Captioner] 20:13:56
 EARTH AND PICTURES ARE THREE YEARS OLD.


[Captioner] 20:13:59
NOW IT IS A PLACE

[Captioner] 20:14:03
 WHERE WE CAN'T GO TO.
IT'S

[Captioner] 20:14:06
 TRASHED, IT'S OVERRUN, IT'S NOT SAFE.


[Captioner] 20:14:10
AND SO NOW, IF I HAVE THIS

[Captioner] 20:14:14
 CORRECT, YOU'RE GOING TO TURN THIS INTO A

[Captioner] 20:14:18
 PARK AGAIN, WHICH WAS ALREADY A PARK?


[Captioner] 20:14:21
WHAT CHANGED?
AND HOW ARE YOU GOING TO DO

[Captioner] 20:14:24
  THAT?
AND WHY DIDN'T YOU DO IT TWO YEARS 

[Captioner] 20:14:30
AGO?
AND SINCE THIS IS NOT PUBLIC SPEAKING, 

[Captioner] 20:14:33
I BELIEVE YOU CAN ADDRESS THAT QUESTION

[Captioner] 20:14:35
 DIRECTLY.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:14:43
>> Mr. Quintanilla: OUR LAST SPEAKER IS WILLIAM YRAGUI.


[Captioner] 20:14:49
>> YES, GOOD EVENING.


[Captioner] 20:14:56
GOOD EVENING.
MISSION PEAK

[Captioner] 20:14:59
 CONSERVANCY.
SPEAKING OUT IN REGARDS TO VALLEJO

[Captioner] 20:15:02
 MILLS.
THE 23 PARKING SPACES

[Captioner] 20:15:06
 IS LIMITED, AS YOU CONSIDER THE USES OF THIS

[Captioner] 20:15:09
 PARK, 30,000 SQUARE FOOT DOG PARK

[Captioner] 20:15:13
 AND SEVERAL PICKLEBALL COURTS WITH THE POSSIBILITY FOR

[Captioner] 20:15:16
 EXPANSION DOWNSTREAM, THAT IMPLIES THAT THIS

[Captioner] 20:15:19
 PARK WILL BE WELL USED.
NOW, SEVERAL

[Captioner] 20:15:22
 SPEAKERS HAVE POINTED OUT THAT EAST BAY REGIONAL IS BUILDING

[Captioner] 20:15:25
 A TRAIL GOING UP NILES CANYON.
THEY'RE

[Captioner] 20:15:28
 ALSO -- THEY'RE USING VALLEJO MILLS AS A TERMINUS FOR A

[Captioner] 20:15:31
 3 1/2 MILE EASEMENT THAT IS BEING CURRENTLY BUILT.


[Captioner] 20:15:34
THEY HIRED THE CONTRACTORS FOR AN EASEMENT THAT GOES

[Captioner] 20:15:38
 FROM GUERIN PARK TO VALLEJO MILLS, AND THAT

[Captioner] 20:15:41
 WILL CONNECT GUERIN TO

[Captioner] 20:15:45
 VALLEJO MILLS TO THE NILES CANYON TRAIL AND POSSIBLY TO THE

[Captioner] 20:15:49
 GREENWAY TRAIL SO VALLEJO MILLS BECOMES A VERY IMPORTANT TERMINUS

[Captioner] 20:15:51
 FOR MULTIPLE PARKS, MULTIPLE TRAILHEADS.


[Captioner] 20:15:55
23 PARKING SPACES IS LIMITED, AND THE REASON THAT

[Captioner] 20:15:58
 THIS IS A PROBLEM IS THAT PARKING IS DEFINED

[Captioner] 20:16:02
 AND HAS BEEN DEFINED BY OUR COMMUNITY SERVICES DEPARTMENT AS

[Captioner] 20:16:05
 THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE FOR PEOPLE ACCESSING OUR LOCAL

[Captioner] 20:16:09
 PARKS.
AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT OUR

[Captioner] 20:16:12
 PARKS, PARKING HAS BEEN A CONSISTENT SOURCE OF CONFLICT

[Captioner] 20:16:15
 ACROSS MOST OF THEM.
SO FOR INSTANCE,

[Captioner] 20:16:19
 VARGAS MILLS HAS SIX SPACES, 25 SPACES

[Captioner] 20:16:22
 UP ON THE STAGING AREA, APPROXIMATELY SIX DOWN AT THE BOTTOM.


[Captioner] 20:16:26
THE REST OF IT IS IN FRONT OF NEIGHBORHOODS

[Captioner] 20:16:29
.
COYOTE HILL IS THE

[Captioner] 20:16:32
 SECOND MOST CLOSED

[Captioner] 20:16:35
 PARKING SYSTEM OUT OF 73 PARKS.
IT

[Captioner] 20:16:39
 IS CLOSED SEVERAL WEEKENDS EVERY MONTH DUE TO PARKING,

[Captioner] 20:16:42
 PARKING ON COMMERCE DRIVE IS LIMITED BY THE CITY.


[Captioner] 20:16:45
WE NEED TO ENCOURAGE AND EXPAND PARKING ACCESS AT

[Captioner] 20:16:48
 OUR LOCAL PARKS TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO GET OUT AND

[Captioner] 20:16:51
 BE HEALTHY.
SO BUILDING A PARK WITH LIMITED

[Captioner] 20:16:54
 PARKING BUILDS IN THE CONFLICT FROM DAY ONE.


[Captioner] 20:16:57
AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT OUR COMMUNITY SERVICES DEPARTMENT SHOULD 

[Captioner] 20:17:00
BE WORKING TO AVOID.
NOT BUILDING INTO

[Captioner] 20:17:03
 THE SYSTEM.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:17:07
>> Mr. Quintanilla: THAT WAS OUR LAST SPEAKER.


[Captioner] 20:17:11
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
AND

[Captioner] 20:17:14
 AT THIS TIME, I'LL BRING IT BACK TO THE COUNCIL FOR ANY

[Captioner] 20:17:17
 CLARIFYING QUESTIONS.
COUNCILMEMBER

[Captioner] 20:17:20
 SALWAN.
>> Councilmember Salwan: THANK YOU, 

[Captioner] 20:17:22
MADAME MAYOR.
I JUST HAD SOME QUESTIONS FOR STAFF.


[Captioner] 20:17:46
HOW ARE YOU DOING TODAY?
>> GOOD EVENING.


[Captioner] 20:17:50
>> Councilmember Salwan: SO I THINK THAT WAS A GOOD POINT BECAUSE I

[Captioner] 20:17:54
 HAVE SEEN A PARK CALLED

[Captioner] 20:17:57
 VALLEJO MILL, VALLEJO MILLS, BUT IN GENERAL, I

[Captioner] 20:18:01
 THINK VALLEJO MILL IS PERHAPS THE BETTER TERM, OR I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S

[Captioner] 20:18:04
 A TYPO OR IF WE NEED TO RE-LOOK AT THAT, SO JUST

[Captioner] 20:18:08
 WANTED TO KIND OF PASS THAT ALONG.
>> WELL, THANK

[Captioner] 20:18:10
 YOU, HONORABLE MAYOR AND CITY COUNCILMEMBERS.


[Captioner] 20:18:13
I THINK THAT FIRST OF ALL WE WANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT IT

[Captioner] 20:18:17
 IS CURRENTLY ADOPTED

[Captioner] 20:18:19
 AS VALLEJO MILL IN THE ADOPTED GENERAL PLAN.


[Captioner] 20:18:22
WE DID IN OUR MASTER PLAN ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE

[Captioner] 20:18:26
 WERE TWO MILLS THAT WERE ON THE SITE.
THERE WAS

[Captioner] 20:18:29
 A MILL IN 1841, AND

[Captioner] 20:18:32
 A MILL IN 1853.
AND SO

[Captioner] 20:18:35
 IT MOST COMMONLY GETS REFERRED TO AS VALLEJO

[Captioner] 20:18:38
 MILLS, AND IT CERTAINLY IS A TECHNICAL ADJUSTMENT WE WILL NEED TO COME BACK 

[Captioner] 20:18:41
TO COUNCIL WITH, ALONG WITH SEVERAL OF OUR

[Captioner] 20:18:45
 PARKS THAT WE'LL NEED TO CLARIFY THE NAMES TO MAKE SURE THEY MATCH

[Captioner] 20:18:48
 BOTH THE COMBINATION OF WHAT THEY GET CALLED LOCALLY TO WHAT

[Captioner] 20:18:52
 THEY WERE OFFICIALLY NAMED INTO OUR PARK SYSTEM AND WE'LL NEED TO

[Captioner] 20:18:54
 DO A CLEAN-UP ACTION FOR SEVERAL PARKS AT THAT TIME.


[Captioner] 20:18:58
WE DO RECOGNIZE THE ERROR, THOUGH, THIS

[Captioner] 20:19:00
 EVENING.
>> Councilmember Salwan: BECAUSE I 

[Captioner] 20:19:03
GOOGLED IT AND EVEN IN OUR CITY PARK, IT SAYS VALLEJO MILL.


[Captioner] 20:19:07
GOOGLE KNOWS EVERYTHING, RIGHT?
THE PARKING --

[Captioner] 20:19:10
 I'M SORRY, I DO FEEL LIKE 23 PARKING

[Captioner] 20:19:12
 SEEMS KIND OF LIGHT.
IS THERE ANY WAY OF ADDING MORE 

[Captioner] 20:19:14
PARKING OR IS THAT DIFFICULT AT THIS SITE?


[Captioner] 20:19:19
>> SO WE CURRENTLY HAVE FUNDING FOR 23 SPACES, WHICH WE

[Captioner] 20:19:22
 FEEL IS APPROPRIATE FOR THE NUMBER OF PICKLEBALL COURTS

[Captioner] 20:19:26
 AND THE DOG PARK AT THIS TIME.
WE DO HAVE THE OPTION

[Captioner] 20:19:29
 TO EXPAND UP TO 25 SPACES AT A LATER

[Captioner] 20:19:32
 TIME, IF WE SEE AND WORK WITH EAST BAY REGIONAL PARK

[Captioner] 20:19:35
 DISTRICT TO LOOK AT THE TRAIL SYSTEM WITH THEM AND SEE WE

[Captioner] 20:19:38
 WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE LARGER SYSTEM TOGETHER WE WOULD BE WORKING WITH

[Captioner] 20:19:42
 THEM TO IDENTIFY WHEN THAT WOULD ALL COME INTO PLACE AND

[Captioner] 20:19:45
 TO IDENTIFY WHEN THE APPROPRIATE TIME IS TO EXPAND PARKING AT

[Captioner] 20:19:48
 THAT TIME.
>> Councilmember Salwan: SO DID YOU 

[Captioner] 20:19:51
SAY 25 ADDITIONAL OR UP TO -- LIKE TWO MORE?


[Captioner] 20:19:54
>> IT'S CURRENTLY 23 PARKING SPACES THAT WE'RE LOOKING TO

[Captioner] 20:19:56
 PUT IN CURRENTLY.
>> Councilmember Salwan: RIGHT.


[Captioner] 20:19:59
>> AND WE WOULD HAVE UP TO 25 ADDITIONAL SPACES THAT WE COULD

[Captioner] 20:20:02
 PUT IN AT A LATER DATE.
AT THIS TIME WE'RE NOT

[Captioner] 20:20:04
 PROJECTING TO DO THAT AT THIS TIME.
>> Councilmember Salwan: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:20:08
AND THEN JUST LIKE TIMELINE, LIKE WHAT DO

[Captioner] 20:20:11
 YOU FORESEE AS WHEN THIS WILL ALL GET GOING AND

[Captioner] 20:20:14
 CONSTRUCTION AND ALL OF THAT?
>> SO AT THIS

[Captioner] 20:20:17
 TIME, WE'RE BRINGING TO YOU JUST THE SITE DEVELOPMENT PLAN TO MAKE SURE 

[Captioner] 20:20:19
THAT IT MATCHES WITH WHAT WE INTEND TO DO.


[Captioner] 20:20:22
WE'LL BE WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH STAFF TO MAKE SURE

[Captioner] 20:20:25
 THAT WE HAVE THE CORRECT WRAP-AROUND SERVICES AND

[Captioner] 20:20:29
 THE SERVICE TEAM TO ASSESS THE SERVICE NEEDS

[Captioner] 20:20:32
 THAT WILL BE HAPPENING FOR THE UNHOUSED IN THE VALLEJO MILLS

[Captioner] 20:20:35
 AND THIS WILL BE COORDINATED VERY EFFECTIVELY PRIOR TO THE BEGINNING OF

[Captioner] 20:20:38
 THE PARK PROJECT PROCEEDING.
WE ANTICIPATE

[Captioner] 20:20:40
 THAT HAPPENING OVER THE NEXT YEAR.
>> Councilmember Salwan: OKAY.


[Captioner] 20:20:41
GREAT.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:20:46
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:20:47
COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL, CLARIFYING QUESTIONS.


[Captioner] 20:20:50
THANK YOU.
>> Councilmember Campbell: I BELIEVE

[Captioner] 20:20:54
 MY QUESTION WAS ANSWERED.
I WANTED TO

[Captioner] 20:20:57
 ADDRESS -- BECAUSE I HAD A MEETING WITH THE COMMUNITY ABOUT

[Captioner] 20:21:00
 THE VALLEJO MILL PARK, AND WANTED TO ADDRESS

[Captioner] 20:21:03
 THE PLAN OF HAVE

[Captioner] 20:21:07
ING, FINDING, RELOCATING THE COMMUNITY THAT'S CURRENTLY

[Captioner] 20:21:10
 UNHOUSED IN THAT

[Captioner] 20:21:14
 PARK TO WHATEVER THE PLAN IS GOING TO BE FOR US TO BE

[Captioner] 20:21:17
 ABLE TO DO THAT, AND I THINK YOU ADDRESSED IT, THAT YOU

[Captioner] 20:21:20
 WOULD BE LOOKING AT RESOURCES THAT

[Captioner] 20:21:23
 COULD BE AVAILABLE FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS IN THE PARK AT

[Captioner] 20:21:25
 THIS TIME?
>> THAT IS CORRECT.


[Captioner] 20:21:28
AT THIS TIME, WE'RE ONLY BRINGING TO YOU THE PROPOSED

[Captioner] 20:21:33
 PLAN TO CHANGE THE MASTER PLAN OF THE PARK

[Captioner] 20:21:36
 AND THE TOTAL PLAN AND PROJECT WOULD BE BROUGHT FORWARD AT A LATER TIME

[Captioner] 20:21:38
 TO COUNCIL.
>> Councilmember Campbell: RIGHT, BUT 

[Captioner] 20:21:41
I THINK THAT I HEARD THE COMMUNITY SAY THEY WANTED TO

[Captioner] 20:21:45

[Captioner] 20:21:49
 IS TO RELOCATE THE

[Captioner] 20:21:52
 UNHOUSED COMMUNITY IN VALLEJO

[Captioner] 20:21:55
 MILL PRIOR TO ANY CONSTRUCTION OR ANYTHING ELSE GOING ON.


[Captioner] 20:21:58
IS THAT THE PLAN?


[Captioner] 20:22:02
>> TO BUTTRESS SUZANNE'S

[Captioner] 20:22:05
 COMMENTS, COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL, WE CAN CONFIRM THAT

[Captioner] 20:22:09
 IF THE CITY COUNCIL MOVES FORWARD WITH THIS

 WORKING TOGETHER TO DEVELOP A

[Captioner] 20:22:22
 RELOCATION PLAN THAT WILL INCLUDE

[Captioner] 20:22:25
 SOME SHELTER AND SUPPORTIVE

[Captioner] 20:22:27
 SERVICES.
>> Councilmember Campbell: OKAY.


[Captioner] 20:22:30
I THOUGHT THAT'S WHAT I HEARD BUT I JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY THAT

[Captioner] 20:22:33
 THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT THE GAME PLAN

[Captioner] 20:22:34
 IS.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.


[Captioner] 20:22:39
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU, COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL.


[Captioner] 20:22:43
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN?
>> Councilmember Salwan:

[Captioner] 20:22:46
 I'M READY TO MOVE THIS FORWARD IF

[Captioner] 20:22:49
 THERE'S NO OTHER CONCERNS.
>> Vice Mayor Cox: SECOND.


[Captioner] 20:22:50
>> Mayor Mei: SECOND BY VICE MAYOR COX.


[Captioner] 20:22:54
COUNCILMEMBER KENG, DID YOU HAVE

[Captioner] 20:22:57
 HAVE -- OKAY.
SO WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND.


[Captioner] 20:23:02
I'LL JUST MAKE SOME GENERAL COMMENTS SAYING THAT I KNOW THAT WE'VE HAD A

[Captioner] 20:23:05
 LOT OF FEEDBACK ON THIS PARK.
I'M

[Captioner] 20:23:08
 VERY FAMILIAR AND THE POINT IN TIME COUNTS THAT WE'VE BEEN

[Captioner] 20:23:12
 OUT THERE, I'VE WALKED THAT MANY, MANY TIMES

[Captioner] 20:23:15
 AND THROUGH DIFFERENT EVENTS.
I RECOGNIZE

[Captioner] 20:23:18
 THAT IT'S BEEN A TOUGH COUPLE YEARS AND WE'VE SEEN THE

[Captioner] 20:23:21
 IMPACTS NOT JUST IN OUR CITY BUT IN MANY CITIES,

[Captioner] 20:23:25
 ESPECIALLY UNFORTUNATELY WITH THE PARKS THAT WE

[Captioner] 20:23:28
 HAVE HAD SOME CHALLENGES.
I DON'T KNOW

[Captioner] 20:23:32
 IF DIRECTOR WOLF, IF YOU'D LIKE TO COMMENT ON ANY OF THE COMMENTS EARLIER 

[Captioner] 20:23:35
THAT WAS ADDRESSED IN TERMS OF SOME OF THE MAINTENANCE AND

[Captioner] 20:23:39
 CLEAN-UP.
I KNOW THAT DURING

[Captioner] 20:23:42
 THE STATE OF THE CITY, WE ENSURED SPECIFICALLY THAT WE'VE DONE A LOT

[Captioner] 20:23:45
 OF EFFORTS IN TERMS OF AS A CITY ON PICKING UP TRASH AND ALSO

[Captioner] 20:23:49
 PROVIDING DIFFERENT SERVICES, AND I KNOW I ALSO SEE DIRECTOR

[Captioner] 20:23:53
 SHENFIL IN THE AUDIENCE, SO I DON'T KNOW IF EITHER ONE OF YOU WANT

[Captioner] 20:23:56
 TO ADDRESS THAT

[Captioner] 20:23:58
 IN CONTEXT.
I KNOW AS MENTIONED BY THE COUNCIL 

[Captioner] 20:24:02
BEFORE WE MOVE FORWARD, WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT'S PART OF

[Captioner] 20:24:05
 IT, BUT I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT YOU 

[Captioner] 20:24:08
HEARD EARLIER.
>> WE WOULD JUST LIKE TO

[Captioner] 20:24:11
 ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE RECOGNIZE THE DIFFICULTY

[Captioner] 20:24:15
 THAT IT HAS BEEN TO GET TO THE PARK.
WE HEAR A LOT OF

[Captioner] 20:24:19
 OUR PARK PATRONS SHARING FRUSTRATION TO GET

[Captioner] 20:24:22
 TO THE PARK.
WE ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT WE NEED

[Captioner] 20:24:25
 THAT COMPREHENSIVE PERSONALIZED SUPPORT AND

[Captioner] 20:24:28
 RESOURCES TO HELP THOSE INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES THAT HAVE VERY

[Captioner] 20:24:32
 COMPLEX ISSUES THERE, AND

[Captioner] 20:24:35
 THE COMPLEX CHALLENGES THAT FACE OUR

[Captioner] 20:24:39
 UNHOUSED, THAT REALLY IS COMPLEX IN GETTING LONG TERM

[Captioner] 20:24:42
 HOUSING, AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A THOUGHTFUL PROCESS TO MOVE

[Captioner] 20:24:45
 FORWARD AND BE VERY THOUGHTFUL IN MOVING FORWARD

[Captioner] 20:24:48
 IN A WAY THAT PROCEEDS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF

[Captioner] 20:24:50
 THE COUNCIL AND THE COUNCIL DIRECTION FOR US.


[Captioner] 20:24:53
>> Mayor Mei: AND I ALSO ECHO I THINK SOME OF THE COMMENTS EARLIER

[Captioner] 20:24:56
 MADE FROM SOME OF MY FELLOW COUNCILMEMBERS WHICH IS AT THIS TIME I

[Captioner] 20:25:00
 KNOW YOU'RE LOOKING AT 23 SPACES BUT ULTIMATELY I

[Captioner] 20:25:03
 HOPE WE EXPLORE THE OPTION BECAUSE I THINK IF ALL

[Captioner] 20:25:06
 THINGS WORK THE WAY WE WANT THEM TO THAT WE WILL HAVE GREATER USAGE OF

[Captioner] 20:25:09
 THE PARK AND THAT WILL BE AN OPTION THAT WE CAN EXPAND THE PARKING SPACES 

[Captioner] 20:25:12
THAT IS NEEDED FOR THE COMMUNITY.
SO WE HAVE A MOTION AND

[Captioner] 20:25:15
 A SECOND.
MOTION BY COUNCILMEMBER

[Captioner] 20:25:19
 SALWAN, SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER -- VICE MAYOR COX.

[Captioner] 20:27:45
I'LL REPORT OUT REAL QUICKLY.
I

[Captioner] 20:27:48
 WENT LAST WEEK TO MEET WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO

[Captioner] 20:27:52
 FOCUS ON THE DISCUSSION ABOUT ENGAGE EVERY

[Captioner] 20:27:55
 STUDENT FOR A SUMMIT, AND ALSO I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE

[Captioner] 20:27:58
 OUR LEGISLATORS WHEN I WAS OUT THERE TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE DIFFERENT 

[Captioner] 20:28:01
PROJECTS AND THANK THEM FOR THEIR SUPPORT FOR THE INFRASTRUCTURE

[Captioner] 20:28:05
 MONEY IN PARTICULAR FOR OUR BROADBAND AND WIRELESS,

[Captioner] 20:28:08
 AS ALSO IN THE PAST SUPPORT WITH SOME OF OUR DIFFERENT

[Captioner] 20:28:12
 COMMUNITY GROUPS, AND REAL QUICKLY THIS MORNING, I HAD

[Captioner] 20:28:15
 THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE ABOUT SOME OF THE EFFORTS THAT WE'VE

[Captioner] 20:28:18
 WORKED ON HERE IN THE CITY OF FREMONT ON

[Captioner] 20:28:21
 A PANEL -- POLICY PANEL THAT WAS FOR THE LOCAL INFRASTRUCTURE

[Captioner] 20:28:25
 HUB, AND DISCUSSING HOW THERE'S OPPORTUNITIES FOR

[Captioner] 20:28:29
 USING IRA -- THAT'S INFRASTRUCTURE

[Captioner] 20:28:33
 REINVESTMENT ACT TAX CREDIT WITHIN OUR CITY AND SOME OF THE PROJECTS THAT

[Captioner] 20:28:36
 WE'RE WORKING ON.
IT

[Captioner] 20:28:39
 WAS A GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO HEAR ALSO FROM JOHN PODESTA,

[Captioner] 20:28:42
 OUR SENIOR ADVISER TO THE PRESIDENT ON

[Captioner] 20:28:45
 THE CLEAN ENERGY

[Captioner] 20:28:50
 INNOVATION AS WELL AS THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF TREASURIES CHIEF

[Captioner] 20:28:53
 IMPLEMENTATION OFFICER.
THERE'S SOME GREAT REPORTS THAT HAVE 

[Captioner] 20:28:56
COME OUT AND OPPORTUNITIES, AND IT WAS NICE TO HEAR ABOUT HOW

[Captioner] 20:28:59
 THE CLIMATE ACTION PLANS -- AND I KNOW MANY OF US, AND I WOULD

[Captioner] 20:29:02
 ENCOURAGE US TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH OUR PUBLIC

[Captioner] 20:29:05
 AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS TO PROVIDE INPUT ON THE UPDATE, BECAUSE IT IS

[Captioner] 20:29:09
 VERY IMPORTANT, AND TODAY THEY ALSO PUBLISHED A PAPER

[Captioner] 20:29:12
 WHICH IS SOMETHING I'D BE HAPPY TO SHARE, IT'S THE ALLIANCE

[Captioner] 20:29:16
 FOR SUSTAINABLE FUTURE AND CITIES ADVANCING CLIMATE

[Captioner] 20:29:18
 ACTION, AND THEY PROVIDED SOME GOOD CASE STUDIES AS WELL AS EXAMPLES.


[Captioner] 20:29:22
AND SO JUST WANTED TO

[Captioner] 20:29:25
 SAY APPRECIATED THE CHANCE TO SHARE, AND LOOK FORWARD TO HOPEFULLY US

[Captioner] 20:29:29
 COMPETING FOR SOME OF THE FUNDING, WHICH I THINK IS SO CRITICAL.


[Captioner] 20:29:33
AND WITH THAT --

[Captioner] 20:29:35
 OH, COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN, DID YOU HAVE A REPORT OUT?


[Captioner] 20:29:38
>> Councilmember Salwan: OH, YES.
THAT REMINDED ME WHILE YOU WERE

[Captioner] 20:29:41
 IN YOUR CONFERENCE, I ATTENDED THE

[Captioner] 20:29:45
 ALAMEDA COUNTY MAYORS' CONFERENCE, AND WE WENT TO UNION CITY AT

[Captioner] 20:29:49
 THE MASONIC HOMES.
WE GOT A WONDERFUL TOUR THERE, AND WE

[Captioner] 20:29:51
 HEARD ABOUT UNION CITY'S MULTIMODAL PLAN AROUND THEIR BART

[Captioner] 20:29:55
 STATION, AND WE ALSO HEARD FROM THE MTC CHAIR ABOUT FUTURE

[Captioner] 20:29:58
 PLANS AS FAR AS TRANSPORTATION AND PLANNING AND SO FORTH.


[Captioner] 20:30:01
SO THAT WAS A VERY INTERESTING DISCUSSION, AND THE CITY

[Captioner] 20:30:05
 MANAGER WAS THERE AS WELL, AND WE WERE ABLE TO

[Captioner] 20:30:06
 MINGLE WITH OUR FELLOW MAYORS.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:30:10
>> Mayor Mei: NO, I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT, WE'RE EXCITED THAT WE HAVE 

[Captioner] 20:30:13
A NEW MTC EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, AND I THINK

[Captioner] 20:30:17
  DIRECTOR -- IS GOING TO

[Captioner] 20:30:20
 BE WORKING CLOSELY WITH US ON SOME INFRASTRUCTURE

[Captioner] 20:30:23
 PROJECTS.
RELATED TO THAT, I DIDN'T GET TO JOIN 

[Captioner] 20:30:26
THAT BUT I DID HAVE A MEETING SEPARATELY WITH HANS AND WITH MY

[Captioner] 20:30:29
 FELLOW MAYOR TO TALK ABOUT OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE CAN LEVERAGE,

[Captioner] 20:30:32
 ESPECIALLY I THINK IT'S MORE APRAKTIVE WHEN WE LOOK AT SOME OF THESE PROJECTS

[Captioner] 20:30:36
 TO NOT JUST DO IT INDIVIDUALLY IN OUR OWN CITIES BUT TO DO IT REGIONALLY, 

[Captioner] 20:30:39
AND CERTAINLY HAVING MULTIPLE CITIES IN THE TRI-CITY AREA AND NOT

[Captioner] 20:30:42
 JUST THAT WE'RE FUN, FREMONT, UNION

[Captioner] 20:30:46
 CITY AND NEWARK, BUT THAT WE'RE WORKING

[Captioner] 20:30:48
 TOGETHER GETTING THINGS DONE.
VICE MAYOR COX?


[Captioner] 20:30:52
>> Vice Mayor Cox: YES, I JUST WANTED TO MENTION, I WANTED TO THANK THE CITY

[Captioner] 20:30:55
 STAFF, IT WAS REPORTED OUT HOW THE CITY STAFF HAD WORKED

[Captioner] 20:30:58
 VERY CLOSELY WITH ASSEMBLYMEMBER

[Captioner] 20:31:02
 ALEX LEE'S OFFICE, THE ASSEMBLYMEMBER AS WELL

[Captioner] 20:31:06
 AS WITH SENATOR WAHAB AND HER STAFF, THAT

[Captioner] 20:31:08
 IT RESULTED IN I THINK -- I CAN'T QUOTE THE NUMBER.


[Captioner] 20:31:10
IS IT 5 MILLION OR IS IT MORE THAN THAT?


[Captioner] 20:31:14
I APOLOGIZE.
BUT IT WAS FOR THE COLLABORATION

[Captioner] 20:31:17
 THAT BROUGHT FORTH MORE MONEY HERE TO THE CITY OF

[Captioner] 20:31:22
 FREMONT FOR OUR RESIDENTS, FOR EVERYONE HERE IN FREMONT

[Captioner] 20:31:25
 TO ENJOY THE MONEYS

[Captioner] 20:31:28
 THAT CAME OUT OF WORKING CLOSELY IN THE RELATIONSHIPS WITH

[Captioner] 20:31:31
 OUR STATE LEGISLATIVE, AND SO I

[Captioner] 20:31:34
 REALLY WANTED TO THANK THE CITY STAFF AND THE OFFICES OF

[Captioner] 20:31:38
 BOTH OF THEM.
>> Mayor Mei: I CAN SEND LETTERS.


[Captioner] 20:31:40
>> Vice Mayor Cox: I HAVE IT IN THE EMAIL, I JUST COULDN'T PULL IT UP

[Captioner] 20:31:43
 QUICKLY ENOUGH TO REPORT THE NUMBER, BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT

[Captioner] 20:31:46
 WE RECOGNIZE AND APPRECIATE THE COLLABORATION THAT IS HELPING US IN 

[Captioner] 20:31:49
FREMONT.
WE WERE CHOSEN OUT OF OTHER CITIES TO

[Captioner] 20:31:53
 RECEIVE THIS AMOUNT OF MONEY, WHICH

[Captioner] 20:31:54
 HELPS MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THE QUALITY OF LIFE OF EVERYONE.


[Captioner] 20:31:58
SO I JUST WANTED TO GIVE A SHOUT OUT TO THE ENTIRE

[Captioner] 20:32:02
 CITY TEAM STAFF, ALL THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT

[Captioner] 20:32:05
 COLLABORATION WITH ASSEMBLYMEMBER ALEX

[Captioner] 20:32:09
 LEE AND SENATOR

[Captioner] 20:32:11
 WAHAB.
>> City Mgr. Shackelford: THANK YOU 

[Captioner] 20:32:13
FOR THAT.
SINCE YOU MENTIONED IT, WE RECEIVED A 

[Captioner] 20:32:16
MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF A MULTISERVICE

[Captioner] 20:32:20
 COMMUNITY CENTER AT CENTRAL PARK,

[Captioner] 20:32:23

>> Mayor Mei: I'LL BE HAPPY TO SHARE 

[Captioner] 20:32:38
THE LETTER, BECAUSE I'M THE ONE WHO WROTE IT, SO THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:32:43
SO ALSO, COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN.


[Captioner] 20:32:46
>> Councilmember Kassan: THANK YOU.
YEAH, I JUST WANTED TO POINT

[Captioner] 20:32:50
 OUT THAT WE HAD TALKED ABOUT HOW THIS

[Captioner] 20:32:53
 PART OF THE AGENDA CAN OFTEN START TO GO INTO

[Captioner] 20:32:56
 SOME THINGS BEYOND PEOPLE'S COMMITTEE ASSIGNMENTS, AND I JUST HOPE

[Captioner] 20:32:59
 WE CAN REMEMBER THAT WE DID AGREE AS A COUNCIL

[Captioner] 20:33:03
 THAT THIS TIME IS REALLY JUST FOR TALKING ABOUT OUR

[Captioner] 20:33:06
 COMMITTEE ASSIGNMENTS AND NOT OTHER MEETINGS WE'VE ATTENDED

[Captioner] 20:33:10
 OR GENERAL COMMENTS, SO I HOPE WE

[Captioner] 20:33:12
 CAN GO BACK TO WHAT WE ALL AGREED ON.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:33:15
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
COUNCILMEMBER

[Captioner] 20:33:18
 CAMPBELL.
NO, I'M GLAD THAT MANY OF US SERVE ON

[Captioner] 20:33:21
 SO MANY COMMITTEES AND I KNOW COUNCILMEMBER

[Captioner] 20:33:28
 FOR THE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES TO THE TRAINING THAT WAS THERE FOR THE 

[Captioner] 20:33:31

SO WITH THAT, I JUST

[Captioner] 20:33:34
 WANTED TO THANK EVERYONE FOR THEIR REPRESENTATION AND THEIR WORK ON

[Captioner] 20:33:37
 ALL THESE DIFFERENT EFFORTS, AND I

[Captioner] 20:33:41
