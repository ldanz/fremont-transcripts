BY VINAY SING.


[Captioner] 19:12:42
H


[Captioner] 19:12:43
>> Mayor Mei: THEY'RE COMING


[Captioner] 19:12:43
RIGHT NOW.


[Captioner] 19:12:52
SUE TWO MINUTES?


[Captioner] 19:12:53
>> Mayor Mei: TWO MINUTES,
PLEASE.


[Captioner] 19:12:55
>> I'M NOT GOOD AT PUBLIC


[Captioner] 19:12:56
SPEAKING SO I'M JUST GOING TO


[Captioner] 19:12:58
READ THE EMAIL I SENT EARLIER, A


[Captioner] 19:12:58
COUPLE DAYS AGO.


[Captioner] 19:13:03
SO I'VE BEEN A FREMONT RESIDENT


[Captioner] 19:13:08
SINCE 1987 AND I SUPPORT FREMONT


[Captioner] 19:13:09
INITIATIVES FOR BIKING


[Captioner] 19:13:10
INFRASTRUCTURE, THANK YOU FOR


[Captioner] 19:13:11
EVERYTHING YOU'RE DOING, REALLY


[Captioner] 19:13:11
APPRECIATE THAT.


[Captioner] 19:13:14
SO COUPLE OF SUGGESTIONS.


[Captioner] 19:13:15
FOR IMPROVEMENT.


[Captioner] 19:13:20
I KNOW BEFORE PANDEMIC, THERE


[Captioner] 19:13:24
WAS A HEARING TO IMPROVE THE


[Captioner] 19:13:25
STREET ON PASEO PADRE BETWEEN


[Captioner] 19:13:26
WASHINGTON AND DRISCOLL.


[Captioner] 19:13:32
I THINK THERE WAS SOME


[Captioner] 19:13:33
DISCUSSION ON IT AND THERE WAS


[Captioner] 19:13:35
SOME IDEAS HOW TO IMPROVE
SAFETY.


[Captioner] 19:13:40
BECAUSE THE TWO LANES ON PASEO


[Captioner] 19:13:44
PADRE GOING EACH WAY WHEN THERE


[Captioner] 19:13:46
ARE PARKED CARS AND VANS IN THE


[Captioner] 19:13:49
BIKE LANE IS WAY NARROW, SO IF


[Captioner] 19:13:52
YOU ARE BIKING ALONG, YOU NEED


[Captioner] 19:13:54
TO KEEP AT LEAST FOUR FEET


[Captioner] 19:13:56
DISTANCE FROM THE PARKED CARS SO


[Captioner] 19:13:58
OTHERWISE YOU GET DOORED, BUT IF


[Captioner] 19:14:01
YOU TRY TO KEEP 4 FEET DISTANCE,


[Captioner] 19:14:03
OR ALMOST INTO THE CAR LANE, THE


[Captioner] 19:14:03
SLOW CAR LANE.


[Captioner] 19:14:06
SO I HAVE USED THAT A FEW TIMES


[Captioner] 19:14:09
JUST TO GO TO LIBRARY OR TO


[Captioner] 19:14:11
DOWNTOWN, COMING FROM PASEO


[Captioner] 19:14:16
PADRE SOUTH INTO THE CITY, AND I


[Captioner] 19:14:19
NOTICE UNFORTUNATELY THE CARS


[Captioner] 19:14:20
THAT SPEED DON'T STAY IN THE


[Captioner] 19:14:20
LEFT LANE, THEY GO INTO THE


[Captioner] 19:14:22
RIGHT LANE, HOPING THE POLICE


[Captioner] 19:14:24
WON'T NOTICE THEM IF THEY'RE IN


[Captioner] 19:14:25
THE SLOW LANE.


[Captioner] 19:14:31
>> Mayor Mei: YOU STILL HAVE


[Captioner] 19:14:31
30 SECONDS LEFT.


[Captioner] 19:14:34
>> OKAY, SO THAT PUTS THE


[Captioner] 19:14:35
BICYCLE WAY CLOSE TO THE


[Captioner] 19:14:38
SPEEDING CAR, IN TRYING TO AVOID


[Captioner] 19:14:40
THE DOORS, YOU ARE REALLY


[Captioner] 19:14:41
GETTING INTO THE CAR LANE --


[Captioner] 19:14:42
CLOSE TO THE CAR LANE.


[Captioner] 19:14:45
SO I'M REQUESTING EITHER TO MAKE


[Captioner] 19:14:48
THE BIKE LANE WIDER OR MAKE THE


[Captioner] 19:14:49
NEXT LANE SHARED BETWEEN THE CAR


[Captioner] 19:14:51
AND THE BIKES, MAKE IT SHARED,


[Captioner] 19:14:55
SO RIGHT NOW THERE'S NOTHING


[Captioner] 19:14:57
EXISTING, AND LASTLY -- IS THAT
IT?


[Captioner] 19:14:58
>> Mayor Mei: YOU MAY FINISH


[Captioner] 19:14:59
YOUR SENTENCE.


[Captioner] 19:15:02
>> AND LASTLY, IF YOU COULD PUT


[Captioner] 19:15:04
SOME CAMERAS TO DISCOURAGE THE


[Captioner] 19:15:04
SPEEDING CARS.


[Captioner] 19:15:06
SO THEY KNOW THEY COULD GET


[Captioner] 19:15:09
TICKETED IF THEY'RE NOT, YOU


[Captioner] 19:15:09
KNOW, WITHIN THE LIMITS.


[Captioner] 19:15:10
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:15:10
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:15:15
>> Councilmember Campbell:


[Captioner] 19:15:17
EXCUSE ME, MAYOR MEI, CAN I
CLARIFY?


[Captioner] 19:15:19
ARE WE TALKING WITH SPEAKERS ON


[Captioner] 19:15:21
ITEMS THAT ARE NOT ON THE
AGENDA?


[Captioner] 19:15:23
BECAUSE HE WAS TALKING ABOUT THE


[Captioner] 19:15:26
BIKE AND ISN'T THAT M THAT'S


[Captioner] 19:15:26
COMING UP NEXT?


[Captioner] 19:15:28
>> Mayor Mei: WELL, THAT'S


[Captioner] 19:15:28
TRUE, YES.


[Captioner] 19:15:30
>> Ms. Gauthier: THEY TURN IN


[Captioner] 19:15:33
CARDS FOR -- INITIALLY 3A, WHICH


[Captioner] 19:15:35
WAS CEREMONIAL AND THEN IT WAS


[Captioner] 19:15:36
SWITCHED TO 4, FOR UNDER ORAL


[Captioner] 19:15:36
COMMUNICATION.


[Captioner] 19:15:38
>> Councilmember Campbell:


[Captioner] 19:15:38
OKAY, JUST CHECKING.


[Captioner] 19:15:38
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:15:42
>> Mayor Mei: BUT WE WILL BE


[Captioner] 19:15:43
TALKING ABOUT THE BIKE TRANSIT


[Captioner] 19:15:44
PLAN, SO JUST TO LET PEOPLE KNOW


[Captioner] 19:15:46
FOR THE AUDIENCE, WE HAVE AN


[Captioner] 19:15:47
ITEM THIS EVENING.


[Captioner] 19:15:49
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT WOULD CALL


[Captioner] 19:15:50
SPECIFICALLY ON TO THAT PLAN OR


[Captioner] 19:15:53
ON TO A COMMENT ABOUT PASEO
PADRE.


[Captioner] 19:15:57
BUT WE WILL BE HAVING AN AGENDA


[Captioner] 19:15:59
ITEM THIS EVENING GOING INTO


[Captioner] 19:16:00

[Captioner] 19:16:19
>> MY NAME IS GLEN KIRBY, MAYOR


[Captioner] 19:16:19
AND MEMBERS OF COUNCIL.


[Captioner] 19:16:20
I APPRECIATE THIS.


[Captioner] 19:16:23
I'M SPEAKING ACTUALLY ON THE


[Captioner] 19:16:24
CEREMONIAL PROCLAMATION THAT WAS


[Captioner] 19:16:25
JUST PRESENTED A BIT AGO.


[Captioner] 19:16:29
I'M PRESIDENT OF THE FREMONT


[Captioner] 19:16:30
FREEWHEELERS BICYCLE CLUB, WHICH


[Captioner] 19:16:33
HAS ABOUT 400 MEMBERS, AND WE


[Captioner] 19:16:35
HOST RIDES IN THE CITY PRETTY


[Captioner] 19:16:38
MUCH EVERY WEEK OF THE YEAR.


[Captioner] 19:16:39
JUST ABOUT A WEEK AND A HALF


[Captioner] 19:16:41
AGO, WE HAD OUR ANNUAL


[Captioner] 19:16:44
FUNDRAISING EVENT, THE PRIMA


[Captioner] 19:16:46
VERA CENTURY, WHICH BROUGHT


[Captioner] 19:16:47
NEARLY A THOUSAND PEOPLE INTO


[Captioner] 19:16:51
THE CITY TO RIDE ON CITY 
STREETS.


[Captioner] 19:16:54
I'M ALSO VICE CHAIR OF THE


[Captioner] 19:16:56
BICYCLE AND PEDESTRIAN ADVISORY


[Captioner] 19:16:58
COMMITTEE IN THE CITY OF UNION
CITY.


[Captioner] 19:17:00
SO FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE, I'D


[Captioner] 19:17:02
LIKE TO SAY I APPLAUD THE


[Captioner] 19:17:03
RESOLUTION AND THE PROCLAMATION


[Captioner] 19:17:05
THIS EVENING, AND ALSO YOUR


[Captioner] 19:17:07
ADOPTED BICYCLE PLAN.


[Captioner] 19:17:09
WE'RE SEEING RESULTS THROUGHOUT


[Captioner] 19:17:11
THE CITY IN IMPLEMENTING THAT


[Captioner] 19:17:14
PLAN AT ARTERIALS AND ON


[Captioner] 19:17:15
INTERSECTIONS THROUGHOUT THE
CITY.


[Captioner] 19:17:18
BUT FRANKLY, SOME OF THOSE


[Captioner] 19:17:19
FACILITIES HAVE BEEN VIEWED BY


[Captioner] 19:17:22
THE ACTIVE CYCLING COMMUNITY


[Captioner] 19:17:23
WITH MIXED REVIEWS.


[Captioner] 19:17:27
SO I'D LIKE TO SUGGEST AS AN


[Captioner] 19:17:29
ASIDE HERE THAT YOU RE-AUTHORIZE


[Captioner] 19:17:31
A BICYCLE AND PEDESTRIAN


[Captioner] 19:17:32
ADVISORY COMMITTEE.


[Captioner] 19:17:35
TO LOOK AT THE FUTURE FACILITIES


[Captioner] 19:17:36
YOU'RE PLANNING ON INSTALLING.


[Captioner] 19:17:39
AND UNION CITY, WE REVIEW


[Captioner] 19:17:41
PROPOSED FACILITIES IN THE EARLY


[Captioner] 19:17:44
PLANNING STAGES, SUCH AS 35%
DESIGN.


[Captioner] 19:17:47
COMMENTS FROM BPAC MEMBERS AND


[Captioner] 19:17:50
MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC HAVE


[Captioner] 19:17:52
RESULTED IN CHANGES IN THE


[Captioner] 19:17:53
PLANS, AND BETTER PROJECTS ON


[Captioner] 19:17:53
THE STREET.


[Captioner] 19:17:57
SO I WOULD SERIOUSLY LIKE TO SEE


[Captioner] 19:17:59
YOU IMPLEMENT THE BICYCLE PLAN


[Captioner] 19:18:01
THROUGH INCREASING PUBLIC SAFETY


[Captioner] 19:18:03
AND ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO LEAVE


[Captioner] 19:18:06
THEIR CAR AND RIDE THEIR BIKE TO


[Captioner] 19:18:08
ACTUALLY INCLUDE MORE ACTIVE


[Captioner] 19:18:09
CYCLISTS IN THE PLANNING PROCESS


[Captioner] 19:18:12
AND REACTIVATE YOUR BPAC.


[Captioner] 19:18:12
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:18:14
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:18:16
NEXT SPEAKER, PLEASE.


[Captioner] 19:18:19
>> Ms. Gauthier: VINAY SINGH


[Captioner] 19:18:20
FOLLOWED BY ANDREAS.


[Captioner] 19:18:21
>> HELLO.


[Captioner] 19:18:25
VINAY WILL TALK LATER ON BEHALF


[Captioner] 19:18:26
OF THE TIME THAT I WILL HAVE.


[Captioner] 19:18:31
SO I HAVE -- I LIVE IN VALDEZ


[Captioner] 19:18:37
WAY BY THE PACIFIC RAILROAD, AND


[Captioner] 19:18:38
THE GOLF COURSE, AND SOME OF


[Captioner] 19:18:41
MIGRATE NEIGHBORS ARE HERE, AND


[Captioner] 19:18:42
WE HAVE SOME ISSUE THAT WE


[Captioner] 19:18:45
NEEDED TO BRING UP TODAY TO THE


[Captioner] 19:18:45
COUNCIL.


[Captioner] 19:18:50
IT IS FOR 10 YEARS THAT WE HAVE


[Captioner] 19:18:52
HOMELESS ISSUE IN THE PACIFIC


[Captioner] 19:18:54
RAILROAD AND INSIDE TREES


[Captioner] 19:18:56
BETWEEN PACIFIC RAILROAD AND THE


[Captioner] 19:18:56
GOLF CORE.


[Captioner] 19:18:58
 COURSE.


[Captioner] 19:19:00
UNFORTUNATELY IT HAS NOT BEEN


[Captioner] 19:19:00
ADDRESSED YET.


[Captioner] 19:19:02
THE HOMELESS MAKE VERY LOUD


[Captioner] 19:19:04
NOISES BY FIGHTING EVEN AT
MIDNIGHT.


[Captioner] 19:19:06
I HAVE RECORDED THEIR VOICES


[Captioner] 19:19:06
WHEN THEY FIGHT.


[Captioner] 19:19:09
THE COMMUNITY IS WORRIED ABOUT


[Captioner] 19:19:10
THEIR FAMILY AND THEIR KIDS'
SAFETY.


[Captioner] 19:19:16
NOW IT'S SO MUCH THAT


[Captioner] 19:19:17
YOU NEED A BIG TRUCK TO REMOVE
THEM.


[Captioner] 19:19:22
THEY HAVE ALSO A SIGNIFICANT


[Captioner] 19:19:24
IMPACT ON THE ENVIRONMENT AND


[Captioner] 19:19:25
THEIR SPECIES LIVING IN THAT
AREA.


[Captioner] 19:19:28
THEY HAVE ALSO USED FIRE IN THE


[Captioner] 19:19:29
TREES TO WARM THEMSELVES.


[Captioner] 19:19:31
THIS IS VERY HAZARDOUS FOR THE


[Captioner] 19:19:31
NEIGHBORS.


[Captioner] 19:19:35
THE CITY HAS A FENCE AROUND THE


[Captioner] 19:19:37
AREA AND THE MAN-MADE LAKE TO


[Captioner] 19:19:39
PROTECT THE WILDLIFE FROM PEOPLE


[Captioner] 19:19:39
TO ENTER.


[Captioner] 19:19:41
WE CAN HAVE THE SAME FENCE


[Captioner] 19:19:43
AROUND THE PACIFIC RAILROAD AND


[Captioner] 19:19:46
THE TREES, MAKING IT


[Captioner] 19:19:47
INACCESSIBLE BY THE HOMELESS AND


[Captioner] 19:19:47
THE PEOPLE.


[Captioner] 19:19:51
THE CITY HAS THE CONTACT OF


[Captioner] 19:19:51
PACIFIC RAILROAD.


[Captioner] 19:19:53
THE CITY NEEDS TO GO AFTER THEM


[Captioner] 19:19:55
TO MAKE SURE THEY CLEAN THE
LAND.


[Captioner] 19:19:56
REMOVE THE HOMELESS AND PROTECT


[Captioner] 19:19:56
THE AREA.


[Captioner] 19:19:58
OTHERWISE THEY MUST GET A
CITATION.


[Captioner] 19:20:02
I AM IN TOUCH WITH LAURIE,


[Captioner] 19:20:03
MANAGER OF THE HOMELESS
DEPARTMENT.


[Captioner] 19:20:06
SHE HAS VISITED THE SITE, AND WE


[Captioner] 19:20:07
HAVE GOT PETITION FROM MOST OF


[Captioner] 19:20:12
THE RESIDENTS THAT THEY WOULD


[Captioner] 19:20:13
SUPPORT THE MOVE AND WOULD WANT


[Captioner] 19:20:14
THE CITY TO TAKE ACTION.


[Captioner] 19:20:16
EVERY RESIDENT ON THAT STREET


[Captioner] 19:20:17
HAS SIGNED THIS PETITION.


[Captioner] 19:20:19
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:20:27
>> Ms. Gauthier: VINAY SINGH


[Captioner] 19:20:29
FOLLOWED BY ANDREAS KADAVANICH.


[Captioner] 19:20:31
IS VINAY GOING TO SPEAK?


[Captioner] 19:20:31
>> YES.


[Captioner] 19:20:32
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.


[Captioner] 19:20:34
SO AS ALI SAID, WE HAVE THIS


[Captioner] 19:20:36
ISSUE FOR THE LAST 10 YEARS, AND


[Captioner] 19:20:39
I HAVE STAYED THERE ALL MY
LIFE.


[Captioner] 19:20:41
I DO FEEL FOR THE HOMELESS BUT


[Captioner] 19:20:46
IT TAKES A POINT WHERE THE FECES


[Captioner] 19:20:47
ARE SMELLING BAD AND WE ARE


[Captioner] 19:20:48
REALLY WORRIED ABOUT OUR KIDS


[Captioner] 19:20:52
AND, YOU KNOW, ALSO WE GET


[Captioner] 19:20:53
NEIGHBORS, YOU KNOW, VISITING


[Captioner] 19:20:55
WITH GUESTS AND WE HAVE THIS


[Captioner] 19:20:55
CONTINUOUS ISSUE.


[Captioner] 19:20:57
WE DO UNDERSTAND THAT WE NEED TO


[Captioner] 19:21:00
BE HUMAN, BUT WE NEED TO HAVE


[Captioner] 19:21:02
SANITARY, YOU KNOW, FACILITIES


[Captioner] 19:21:03
WHERE THE HOMELESS ARE TAKEN


[Captioner] 19:21:06
CARE OF AND NOBODY CAN SEE WHERE


[Captioner] 19:21:07
THEY ARE, IT'S ALMOST LIKE


[Captioner] 19:21:09
THEY'RE LIVING IN A JUNGLE.


[Captioner] 19:21:10
SO WE REALLY, REALLY REQUEST THE


[Captioner] 19:21:16
CITY TO TAKE SOME ACTION BECAUSE


[Captioner] 19:21:17
SOME ACTION WILL HELP US AND


[Captioner] 19:21:18
HELP US AS WELL.


[Captioner] 19:21:20
IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO NOT


[Captioner] 19:21:22
ONLY FOR US BUT ALSO FOR THE


[Captioner] 19:21:22
HOMELESS.


[Captioner] 19:21:24
IT CREATES A VERY, VERY BAD


[Captioner] 19:21:25
?RAIR YOE.


[Captioner] 19:21:27
LAST TIME WE TOOK ACTION AT THE


[Captioner] 19:21:28
LIBRARY WHERE THERE WAS A CRIME


[Captioner] 19:21:28
SCENE.


[Captioner] 19:21:30
WE DON'T WANT CRIME TO REPEAT


[Captioner] 19:21:32
FOR THE CITY TO TAKE ACTION SO


[Captioner] 19:21:34
WE REALLY URGE YOU TO HELP US


[Captioner] 19:21:34
DEAL WITH THE SITUATION.


[Captioner] 19:21:35
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.


[Captioner] 19:21:37
>> Ms. Gauthier: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:21:38
MR. KADAVANICH.


[Captioner] 19:21:49
FOLLOWED BY BEJAI SWARY.


[Captioner] 19:21:53
>> GOOD EVENING, ANDREAS


[Captioner] 19:21:54
KADAVANICH, BIKE FREMONT.


[Captioner] 19:21:56
FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU FOR THE


[Captioner] 19:21:57
PROCLAMATION FOR BIKE MONTH.


[Captioner] 19:21:58
IT'S VERY MUCH APPRECIATED.


[Captioner] 19:22:00
WE THINK IT'S REALLY GREAT WHAT


[Captioner] 19:22:02
THE CITY HAS DONE IN TERMS OF


[Captioner] 19:22:03
IMPROVEMENTS FOR BIKE SAFETY,


[Captioner] 19:22:06
PEDESTRIAN SAFETY, GENERALLY


[Captioner] 19:22:08
PEOPLE MOVING ABOUT ON THEIR OWN


[Captioner] 19:22:09
POWER.


[Captioner] 19:22:10
IT'S WHAT MAKES THE CITY TRULY
GREAT.


[Captioner] 19:22:12
ONE OF THE BEST THINGS THE CITY


[Captioner] 19:22:14
HAS DONE IS VISION ZERO.


[Captioner] 19:22:19
IT IS TRULY A REMARKABLE
POLICY.


[Captioner] 19:22:20
I COMMEND FREMONT FOR BEING ONE


[Captioner] 19:22:22
OF THE FEW CITIES THAT'S


[Captioner] 19:22:24
ACTUALLY PULLED IT OFF, AND HAS


[Captioner] 19:22:27
IMPROVED THE FATALITY RATES AND


[Captioner] 19:22:30
THE SEVERE INJURY RATES WITH


[Captioner] 19:22:31
VISION ZERO.


[Captioner] 19:22:33
NEVERTHELESS, AS WE SAW LAST


[Captioner] 19:22:35
WEEK, WE STILL HAVE A LONG WAY


[Captioner] 19:22:35
TO GO.


[Captioner] 19:22:39
WE HAD THREE FATALITIES IN THE


[Captioner] 19:22:39
LAST SIX DAYS ALONE.


[Captioner] 19:22:42
THAT DOESN'T MEAN VISION ZERO IS


[Captioner] 19:22:43
NOT WORKING.


[Captioner] 19:22:45
IF YOU LOOK AT THE STATISTICS,


[Captioner] 19:22:47
THE TREND IS CLEARLY DOWN.


[Captioner] 19:22:50
BUT THIS IS NOT THE TIME TO
WAIVER.


[Captioner] 19:22:53
THIS IS NOT THE TIME TO LISTEN


[Captioner] 19:22:57
TO NAYSAYERS WHO FREQUENTLY AND


[Captioner] 19:23:02
I SAW THIS TODAY, COME UP AND


[Captioner] 19:23:03
REQUEST CHANGES WITHOUT ANY
EVIDENCE.


[Captioner] 19:23:06
AND I REALLY URGE YOU TO LOOK AT


[Captioner] 19:23:08
THE DATA, LOOK AT THE EVIDENCE


[Captioner] 19:23:12
GATHERED BY YOUR STAFF, WHICH


[Captioner] 19:23:13
ALSO GETS REVIEWED BY THE


[Captioner] 19:23:14
MOBILITY COMMISSION, WHICH IS


[Captioner] 19:23:16
THE CITIZENS' REPRESENTATIVE


[Captioner] 19:23:18
THAT YOU HAVE APPOINTED TO MAKE


[Captioner] 19:23:23
SURE THAT THE STAFF -- REVIEW,


[Captioner] 19:23:25
AND I URGE YOU TO STAY THE


[Captioner] 19:23:27
COURSE BECAUSE IT IS WORKING,


[Captioner] 19:23:29
AND FREMONT REALLY IS AN EXAMPLE


[Captioner] 19:23:31
FOR A LOT OF CITIES NOT JUST FOR


[Captioner] 19:23:34
BIKE FRIENDLINESS, BUT FOR


[Captioner] 19:23:37
TRAFFIC SAFETY IN GENERAL FOR


[Captioner] 19:23:39
EVERYBODY:  CYCLISTS,


[Captioner] 19:23:40
PEDESTRIANS, MOTORCYCLISTS,


[Captioner] 19:23:41
DRIVERS TOO.


[Captioner] 19:23:42
VISION ZERO BENEFITS EVERYBODY.


[Captioner] 19:23:43
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.


[Captioner] 19:23:46

[Captioner] 19:24:07
KIND OF BIKING INFRASTRUCTURE


[Captioner] 19:24:08
THAT WE HAVE.


[Captioner] 19:24:11
I'M THE BENEFICIARY OF DECADES


[Captioner] 19:24:13
AND DECADES OF WORK THAT SO MANY


[Captioner] 19:24:13
PEOPLE THAT I KNOW AND DON'T


[Captioner] 19:24:15
KNOW HAVE PUT IN, SO THANKS TO


[Captioner] 19:24:15
EVERYBODY FOR THAT.


[Captioner] 19:24:20
BUT AS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT


[Captioner] 19:24:22
BIKING INFRASTRUCTURE, YOU KNOW,


[Captioner] 19:24:23
I'M SURE EVERYBODY IS THINKING


[Captioner] 19:24:25
ABOUT IT, BUT I WANT TO MENTION


[Captioner] 19:24:26
IT REGARDLESS.


[Captioner] 19:24:28
THIS SHOULD NOT BE A BIKE


[Captioner] 19:24:29
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT MAKES IT


[Captioner] 19:24:31
SAFE FOR, YOU KNOW, JUST PEOPLE


[Captioner] 19:24:32
IN BIKING COSTUMES LIKE ME AND A


[Captioner] 19:24:33
COUPLE OF OTHERS.


[Captioner] 19:24:35
IT SHOULD BE A PLACE THAT IS


[Captioner] 19:24:37
SAFE BIKING FOR EVERYBODY.


[Captioner] 19:24:38
KIDS ESPECIALLY, TO GO TO


[Captioner] 19:24:40
SCHOOL, PEOPLE THAT HAVE


[Captioner] 19:24:41
DISABILITIES, PEOPLE THAT CAN


[Captioner] 19:24:43
ONLY USE, YOU KNOW, MAYBE A


[Captioner] 19:24:44
TRIKE, THEY CANNOT USE A


[Captioner] 19:24:46
BICYCLE, PEOPLE THAT CAN ONLY


[Captioner] 19:24:49
USE A RECUMBENT BIKE, WHICH


[Captioner] 19:24:51
WOULD TYPICALLY NOT BE SEEN BY


[Captioner] 19:24:52
TRUCKS AND BIG VEHICLES, SO


[Captioner] 19:24:53
LET'S THINK ABOUT ALL THOSE


[Captioner] 19:24:55
THINGS AS WE IMPROVE BIKE


[Captioner] 19:24:55
INFRASTRUCTURE, WHICH I'M SURE


[Captioner] 19:24:57
IS PAR OF THE MOBILITY PLAN AS


[Captioner] 19:24:58
WELL M BUT THERE'S ONE THING


[Captioner] 19:25:00
MAYBE I DON'T KNOW ENOUGH OR I


[Captioner] 19:25:02
HAVEN'T BEEN INVOLVED WITH


[Captioner] 19:25:04
ENOUGH, IT'S NOT JUST THE


[Captioner] 19:25:05
INFRASTRUCTURE PART, BUT MY ASK


[Captioner] 19:25:07
IS ALSO TO THINK ABOUT HOW CAN


[Captioner] 19:25:10
WE MAKE A CULTURE CHANGE.


[Captioner] 19:25:14
WE'RE A COUNTRY THAT RELIES ON


[Captioner] 19:25:16
PERSONAL TRANSPORT, YOU KNOW,


[Captioner] 19:25:17
FOUR WHEEL PERSONAL TRANSPORT


[Captioner] 19:25:19
AND MAKING THAT CULTURE CHANGE


[Captioner] 19:25:21
INVOLVES SO MANY THINGS, SOME OF


[Captioner] 19:25:22
WHICH I CAN THINK OF, SOME OF


[Captioner] 19:25:23
WHICH I CANNOT THINK.


[Captioner] 19:25:25
AS PART OF THE PROCLAMATION FOR


[Captioner] 19:25:26
BIKE TO WORK DAY, I'M HOPING


[Captioner] 19:25:28
THAT YOU AS ELECTED OFFICIALS


[Captioner] 19:25:29
ARE ALSO ABLE TO PUT THAT INTO


[Captioner] 19:25:31
ACTION AND SHOW PEOPLE THAT YOU


[Captioner] 19:25:33
CAN GET TO WORK BY BIKE, RIGHT?


[Captioner] 19:25:35
I'LL ALSO JOIN -- I'M PART OF


[Captioner] 19:25:39
THE FREMONT BIKE CLUB, WE HOST A


[Captioner] 19:25:41
FUND, SUNDAY SOCIAL RIDE, JOIN


[Captioner] 19:25:43
US AND SHOW THAT YOU ACTUALLY


[Captioner] 19:25:43
SUPPORT IT.


[Captioner] 19:25:45
IT'S FUN AND WHEN PEOPLE SEE


[Captioner] 19:25:46
ELECTED OFFICIALS TAKING PART IN


[Captioner] 19:25:47
THINGS LIKE THAT, THEY WILL STEP
UP.


[Captioner] 19:25:53
AND ALSO LET'S DESTIGMATIZE
BIKING.


[Captioner] 19:25:55
WHEN I GO TO A LOT OF PLACES I


[Captioner] 19:25:56
SEE AS PART OF THE CITY CODE,


[Captioner] 19:25:57
THERE'S BIKE INFRASTRUCTURE


[Captioner] 19:25:58
THERE, BUT LET'S NOT PUT THEM IN


[Captioner] 19:26:01
THE BACK, WHERE ONLY THE, YOU


[Captioner] 19:26:01
KNOW, ECONOMIC --


[Captioner] 19:26:01
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:26:07
WE ARE LOOKING AT DIFFERENT


[Captioner] 19:26:07
INFRASTRUCTURE AS A WHOLE.


[Captioner] 19:26:08
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:26:11
>> Ms. Gauthier: NORMAN
HOWELL.


[Captioner] 19:26:16
>> THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:26:19
HONORABLE MAYOR MEI, MEMBERS OF


[Captioner] 19:26:22
THE COUNCIL, NORMAN HOWELL, 1585


[Captioner] 19:26:23
VALDEZ WAY.


[Captioner] 19:26:25
I STAND HERE LOOKING AT YOU AND


[Captioner] 19:26:25
THINK I'M ADDRESSING THE SCHOOL


[Captioner] 19:26:26
BOARD.


[Captioner] 19:26:31
AS I COME HERE TONIGHT, I AM


[Captioner] 19:26:34
WITH VINAY AND OUR OTHER


[Captioner] 19:26:34
NEIGHBORS HERE.


[Captioner] 19:26:35
WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THE


[Captioner] 19:26:38
HOMELESS ENCAMPMENT BEHIND US,


[Captioner] 19:26:40
VALDEZ WAY ACROSS THE RAILROAD


[Captioner] 19:26:42
TRACKS IN THE SOUTHEAST CORNER


[Captioner] 19:26:42
OF THE GOLF COURSE.


[Captioner] 19:26:44
IT HAS BECOME QUITE A PROBLEM,


[Captioner] 19:26:46
IT HAS BEEN FOR MANY, MANY


[Captioner] 19:26:51
YEARS, BUT RECENTLY IT'S BECOME


[Captioner] 19:26:52
VERY -- A VERY SERIOUS PROBLEM


[Captioner] 19:26:53
ONCE AGAIN.


[Captioner] 19:26:55
THERE'S BEEN A HUGE ACCUMULATION


[Captioner] 19:26:57
OF TRASH, A LOT OF GROCERY CARTS


[Captioner] 19:26:58
AROUND WHICH JUST IN THIS LAST


[Captioner] 19:27:00
WEEK THE CITY AS APPARENTLY COME


[Captioner] 19:27:02
IN AND LINED THEM UP OUT ON


[Captioner] 19:27:04
PASEO PADRE NOW FOR THE GROCERY


[Captioner] 19:27:05
CARTS FOR THOSE.


[Captioner] 19:27:08
BUT THE TRASH HAS REALLY BECOME


[Captioner] 19:27:13
VERY ANNOYING, AND VERY BULKY IN


[Captioner] 19:27:13
NATURE THERE.


[Captioner] 19:27:15
ANOTHER PROBLEM HAS BEEN


[Captioner] 19:27:16
SANITATION BACK THERE.


[Captioner] 19:27:18
THEY DON'T HAVE ANY TOILET


[Captioner] 19:27:20
FACILITIES AT ALL, AND THERE ARE


[Captioner] 19:27:20
FECES ALL OVER THE PLACE.


[Captioner] 19:27:24
IT IS -- IT IS REALLY VERY


[Captioner] 19:27:25
DISCOURAGING AND DISCOMFORTING


[Captioner] 19:27:26
TO TRY AND GO BACK THERE AND,


[Captioner] 19:27:28
YOU KNOW, AT TIMES HAVE TO WATCH


[Captioner] 19:27:30
WHERE YOU'RE WALKING AND WHEN


[Captioner] 19:27:30
YOU'RE STEPPING WITH THAT.


[Captioner] 19:27:33
IN ADDITION, THERE'S A FIRE


[Captioner] 19:27:34
HAZARD BACK THERE.


[Captioner] 19:27:36
WE'RE OKAY RIGHT NOW BECAUSE


[Captioner] 19:27:37
IT'S STILL WET.


[Captioner] 19:27:40
BUT BETWEEN THAT AREA IN THE


[Captioner] 19:27:42
SOUTHEAST CORNER OF THE GOLF


[Captioner] 19:27:44
COURSE AND WHAT BART DID NEXT TO


[Captioner] 19:27:46
IT, BUILDING A POND AND THEN


[Captioner] 19:27:47
PROCEEDING TO BUILD A JUNGLE


[Captioner] 19:27:50
AROUND IT, THERE'S AN EXTREME


[Captioner] 19:27:51
FIRE HAZARD IN THAT AREA, AND


[Captioner] 19:27:53
YOU HOPEFULLY CAN DO SOMETHING


[Captioner] 19:27:55
ABOUT ADDRESSING THAT SITUATION,


[Captioner] 19:27:58
AND TRY TO START EARLY ENOUGH


[Captioner] 19:28:01
HERE TO DEAL WITH THE FIRE


[Captioner] 19:28:02
HAZARD SITUATION WHICH IS GOING


[Captioner] 19:28:03
TO BE REALLY BAD THIS YEAR.


[Captioner] 19:28:03
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.


[Captioner] 19:28:05
>> Ms. Gauthier: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:28:08
THE NEXT SPEAKER IS JACK BALSH


[Captioner] 19:28:09
FOLLOWED BY RIM VI.


[Captioner] 19:28:14
DAS, FOLLOWED BY ANNIE.


[Captioner] 19:28:18
>> I'M JACK BALCH, 41296 VARGAS
ROAD.


[Captioner] 19:28:20
I'VE LIVED THERE FOR ALMOST 50
YEARS.


[Captioner] 19:28:23
VARGAS ROAD WAS ALWAYS A


[Captioner] 19:28:25
SUBSTANDARD ROAD AND IT'S BECOME


[Captioner] 19:28:28
MUCH WORSE, DUE TO BOTH THE


[Captioner] 19:28:30
INCREASED TRAFFIC AND THE
NEGLECT.


[Captioner] 19:28:33
WITH THE PARK OPEN, A LOT OF


[Captioner] 19:28:35
PEOPLE COME OUT THERE DON'T KNOW


[Captioner] 19:28:37
HOW TO DRIVE, DON'T KNOW HOW TO


[Captioner] 19:28:38
PULL OVER, WE'RE RUN OFF THE


[Captioner] 19:28:39
ROAD QUITE FREQUENTLY.


[Captioner] 19:28:40
WHY THE CITY CAN'T DO ANYTHING


[Captioner] 19:28:42
ABOUT THAT, THE SHOULDERS ARE


[Captioner] 19:28:43
FAILING ON THE ROAD.


[Captioner] 19:28:45
PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO DRIVE IN


[Captioner] 19:28:47
THE MIDDLE, MAKING THE ROAD MUCH


[Captioner] 19:28:48
LESS SAFE.


[Captioner] 19:28:49
IT COME TO THE POINT THAT ONE OF


[Captioner] 19:28:51
THE NEIGHBORS HAS SPENT OVER


[Captioner] 19:28:53
$50,000 HIMSELF MAKING REPAIRS


[Captioner] 19:28:54
TO THIS ROAD.


[Captioner] 19:28:59
WE HAVE TREES THAT HAVE FALLEN


[Captioner] 19:29:01
AND ARE CONTINUING TO FALL AND


[Captioner] 19:29:01
LOOK LIKE THEY'RE GOING TO
FALL.


[Captioner] 19:29:06
THE ADDITIONAL PARKED TRAFFIC IS


[Captioner] 19:29:08
A LEADING CAUSE OF THIS.


[Captioner] 19:29:11
IT'S PROBABLY TRIPLE THE
TRAFFIC.


[Captioner] 19:29:13
WE PREVAILED IN TWO SUITS


[Captioner] 19:29:15
AGAINST THE PARK THAT LIMITED


[Captioner] 19:29:18
THE AMOUNT OF PARKING THEY COULD


[Captioner] 19:29:22
PUT IN, BUT DUE TO


[Captioner] 19:29:22
NON-ENFORCEMENT, THERE'S


[Captioner] 19:29:23
PROBABLY TRIPLE THE AMOUNT OF


[Captioner] 19:29:26
PARKING WITH PEOPLE PARKING ON


[Captioner] 19:29:27
MORRISON CANYON, EVEN THOUGH IT


[Captioner] 19:29:28
IS NOT ALLOWED.


[Captioner] 19:29:31
SOME OF THIS IS DUE TO THE


[Captioner] 19:29:34
INCONSISTENCY OF THE SIGNS.


[Captioner] 19:29:35
THE CITY AND THE COUNTY DON'T


[Captioner] 19:29:37
SEEM TO KNOW WHERE THEIR


[Captioner] 19:29:39
BOUNDARIES IS SO THERE'S ABOUT A


[Captioner] 19:29:39
HUNDRED YARDS BETWEEN TWO SIGNS


[Captioner] 19:29:41
THAT SAY NO PARKING WHEN THE


[Captioner] 19:29:42
FACT OF THE MATTER IS, THERE ARE


[Captioner] 19:29:44
SIGNS THAT SAY NO PARKING ON


[Captioner] 19:29:46
MORRISON CANYON.


[Captioner] 19:29:49
WE'D APPRECIATE YOU OR THE CITY


[Captioner] 19:29:53
IF THEY WOULD, PLEASE, TO GET


[Captioner] 19:29:54
THE NO PARKING SIGNS CORRECT,


[Captioner] 19:29:59
ENFORCE THE NO PARKING, AND FIX


[Captioner] 19:29:59
THE ROAD.


[Captioner] 19:30:01
AND THEN PLEASE KEEP MORRISON


[Captioner] 19:30:03
CANYON CLOSED UNTIL THE UPPER


[Captioner] 19:30:05
MORRISON IS FIXED, BECAUSE THAT


[Captioner] 19:30:08
ROAD IS NOT WIDE ENOUGH FOR BIKE


[Captioner] 19:30:09
TRAFFIC, PEDESTRIAN TRAFFIC AND


[Captioner] 19:30:11
CARS, PARTICULARLY CARS THAT ARE


[Captioner] 19:30:14
NOT USED TO NAVIGATING THE HILLS


[Captioner] 19:30:14
AND THE ROADS.


[Captioner] 19:30:16
OTHER ISSUES, BUT I GUESS I'LL


[Captioner] 19:30:17
HAVE TO COME BACK NEXT WEEK.


[Captioner] 19:30:18
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:30:20
>> Ms. Gauthier: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:30:24
RIM VIDAS, FOLLOWED BY ANNIE.


[Captioner] 19:30:25
>> HELLO.


[Captioner] 19:30:29
I'M ALSO HERE FROM VALDEZ WAY.


[Captioner] 19:30:32
I'M ALSO TALKING ABOUT THE SAME


[Captioner] 19:30:36
PROBLEM OF HOMELESS, I'VE BEEN A


[Captioner] 19:30:39
RESIDENT OF FREMONT FOR OVER 25


[Captioner] 19:30:41
YEARS AND THE PROBLEM HAS NEVER


[Captioner] 19:30:44
BEEN AS ACUTE AS IT IS RIGHT 
NOW.


[Captioner] 19:30:48
TO ADD TO THE SANITATION AND


[Captioner] 19:30:49
ECOLOGY PROBLEM, I WOULD ALSO,


[Captioner] 19:30:51
YOU KNOW, FIRE DANGER, I WOULD


[Captioner] 19:30:54
LIKE TO TELL JUST ONE STORY THAT


[Captioner] 19:30:55
HAPPENED LAST MONTH.


[Captioner] 19:31:00
WHICH ONE OF THE AGITATED


[Captioner] 19:31:02
HOMELESS PERSON JUMPED THE FENCE


[Captioner] 19:31:03
OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD, RAN ACROSS


[Captioner] 19:31:05
THE NEIGHBOR'S BACKYARD, JUMPED


[Captioner] 19:31:07
ANOTHER FENCE AND ENTERED INTO


[Captioner] 19:31:09
THE VALDEZ WAY AND THEN JUMPED


[Captioner] 19:31:10
ANOTHER FENCE ON THE OTHER SIDE


[Captioner] 19:31:14
OF VALDEZ WAY, ENDED UP, YOU


[Captioner] 19:31:16
KNOW, SOMEBODY BASICALLY


[Captioner] 19:31:18
ARRESTED HIM EVENTUALLY, BUT


[Captioner] 19:31:21
THAT CREATED A LOT OF UNSAFETY


[Captioner] 19:31:23
KIND OF WORSE FOR EVERYBODY.


[Captioner] 19:31:24
IF THAT HAPPENS ONE TIME, YOU


[Captioner] 19:31:26
KNOW, IT CAN HAPPEN ANY OTHER


[Captioner] 19:31:26
TIME AS WELL.


[Captioner] 19:31:29
THE COMMUNICATION WITH THE CITY


[Captioner] 19:31:34
IN THE PAST HAS BEEN ALWAYS LIKE


[Captioner] 19:31:36
A PING-PONG BALL.


[Captioner] 19:31:38
BETWEEN CITY AND UNION


[Captioner] 19:31:40
PACIFIC, IT IS NOT CLEAR WHOSE


[Captioner] 19:31:40
RESPONSIBILITY IT IS TO TAKE


[Captioner] 19:31:42
CARE OF THAT SITUATION THAT


[Captioner] 19:31:43
ARISES HERE.


[Captioner] 19:31:45
AND I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS


[Captioner] 19:31:46
ACTUALLY THE CITY'S


[Captioner] 19:31:47
RESPONSIBILITY, BECAUSE IF I


[Captioner] 19:31:50
WOULD HAVE AN ILLEGAL ENCAMPMENT


[Captioner] 19:31:52
IN MY BACKYARD, CITY WOULD


[Captioner] 19:31:54
PROBABLY COMPLAIN AND WOULD


[Captioner] 19:31:54
PROBABLY FINE ME FOR THAT.


[Captioner] 19:31:55
IF UNION PACIFIC IS DOING THE


[Captioner] 19:31:57
SAME THING, IT'S NOT TAKING


[Captioner] 19:31:58
CARE, YOU SHOULD FINE THEM.


[Captioner] 19:32:01
I BELIEVE THAT'S -- THAT WOULD


[Captioner] 19:32:04
BE PROBABLY A MORE PRAGMATIC WAY


[Captioner] 19:32:05
OF DOING THINGS RATHER THAN, YOU


[Captioner] 19:32:08
KNOW, JUST EXCHANGING -- AND WE


[Captioner] 19:32:11
CAME HERE TO VOICE OUR CONCERN


[Captioner] 19:32:13
BECAUSE EXCHANGES OF EMAILS IS


[Captioner] 19:32:13
JUST NOT LEADING ANYWHERE.


[Captioner] 19:32:16
SO PLEASE TAKE SOME ACTION, YOU


[Captioner] 19:32:17
KNOW, TO SOLVE THIS SITUATION.


[Captioner] 19:32:17
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:32:19
>> Ms. Gauthier: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:32:21
ANNIE.


[Captioner] 19:32:24
THEN WE'LL CALL ON OUR PERSON ON


[Captioner] 19:32:24
ZOOM AFTER ANNIE.


[Captioner] 19:32:31
>> YES.


[Captioner] 19:32:33
THANK YOU, MAYOR AND COUNCIL.


[Captioner] 19:32:36
YOU'LL HEAR MY SPECIFIC COMMENTS


[Captioner] 19:32:37
ABOUT THE BIKEWAYS PLAN A BIT


[Captioner] 19:32:39
LATER ON THAT ITEM AS IT WAS
PULLED.


[Captioner] 19:32:41
BUT MORE GENERALLY, I ECHO MANY


[Captioner] 19:32:45
OF THE COMMENTS CONCERNING 


[Captioner] 19:32:46
BIKES, OUR BIKE PLAN AND BIKE


[Captioner] 19:32:48
LANES THAT MANY OF THE PREVIOUS


[Captioner] 19:32:48
COMMENTERS HAVE SAID.


[Captioner] 19:32:50
SPECIFICALLY, THAT THERE'S A


[Captioner] 19:32:54
NEED TO WORK TO INTEGRATE BIKE


[Captioner] 19:32:55
INFRASTRUCTURE AND ACTIVE


[Captioner] 19:32:56
TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE


[Captioner] 19:32:58
DIRECTLY INTO OUR TRANSPORTATION


[Captioner] 19:32:59
PLANS, OUR DEVELOPMENT PLANS,


[Captioner] 19:33:02
NOT AS AN AFTERTHOUGHT BUT JUST


[Captioner] 19:33:04
AS RESPECTED AND JUST AS IN


[Captioner] 19:33:04
THERE AS CAR TRANSPORTATION


[Captioner] 19:33:05
INFRASTRUCTURE.


[Captioner] 19:33:08
TO IMPROVE THE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE


[Captioner] 19:33:11
BIKING, OF PEOPLE USING ACTIVE


[Captioner] 19:33:12
TRANSPORTATION, THE


[Captioner] 19:33:13
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT PEOPLE USE


[Captioner] 19:33:15
TO ENGAGE IN THOSE TYPES OF


[Captioner] 19:33:17
TRANSPORTATION NEEDS TO BE GOOD


[Captioner] 19:33:19
AND NEEDS TO BE ADEQUATELY


[Captioner] 19:33:24
MAINTAINED AND RESPECTED AND


[Captioner] 19:33:25
INVESTED IN IN A SYSTEMIC AND


[Captioner] 19:33:25
MATERIAL FASHION.


[Captioner] 19:33:27
MANY OTHER NATIONS, MANY PARTS


[Captioner] 19:33:28
OF OUR NATION HAVE FIGURED OUT


[Captioner] 19:33:32
HOW TO TRANSITION FROM A VERY


[Captioner] 19:33:33
CAR-ORIENTED PLACE TO A PLACE


[Captioner] 19:33:36
THAT WELCOMES MORE ACTIVE


[Captioner] 19:33:37
TRANSPORTATION, SUCH THAT PEOPLE


[Captioner] 19:33:39
WHO EITHER CAN'T AFFORD TO


[Captioner] 19:33:41
DRIVE, PHYSICALLY CAN'T DRIVE,


[Captioner] 19:33:42
CAN'T GET THEMSELVES AROUND


[Captioner] 19:33:44
EITHER ON BIKES, WALKING OR


[Captioner] 19:33:45
OTHER TYPES OF TRANSPORTATION


[Captioner] 19:33:46
THAT DO NOT REQUIRE A CAR.


[Captioner] 19:33:49
AND THIS WILL BE A GREAT BENEFIT


[Captioner] 19:33:51
TO OUR CITY AS CLIMATE CHANGE


[Captioner] 19:33:53
WORSENS, WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT


[Captioner] 19:33:54
HOW TO GET PEOPLE OUT OF THEIR


[Captioner] 19:33:57
CARS AND ON TO TRANSIT


[Captioner] 19:33:59
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT DOES NOT


[Captioner] 19:34:02
CONTRIBUTE SO HEAVILY TO


[Captioner] 19:34:06
EMISSIONS, AND AS WELL WILL BE


[Captioner] 19:34:07
JUST FOR PEOPLE THAT DO NOT HAVE


[Captioner] 19:34:10
A CAR SO THEY CAN MORE EASILY


[Captioner] 19:34:10
MOVE AROUND OUR CITY.


[Captioner] 19:34:11
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:34:14
>> Ms. Gauthier: THANK YOU.

DIRECT ROUTE FROM MY HOUSE TO A


[Captioner] 19:34:51
SWIMMING CLUB ON LAS PALMAS
AVENUE.


[Captioner] 19:34:53
SOME PEOPLE MAY NOT HAVE TO CUT


[Captioner] 19:34:54
THROUGH GOMES PARK ANYMORE.


[Captioner] 19:34:59
TAKING LAS PALMAS AVENUE TO CUT


[Captioner] 19:35:00
TO THE LAKE THROUGH GOMES PARK


[Captioner] 19:35:01
IS A HASSLE BECAUSE IT'S LONG.


[Captioner] 19:35:06
SINCE SEPTEMBER 2017, MANY


[Captioner] 19:35:07
PEOPLE HAVE COMPLAINED THAT THE


[Captioner] 19:35:12
SHORTCUT IS CLOSED BETWEEN --


[Captioner] 19:35:13
MANY PEOPLE WITH UNDERLYING


[Captioner] 19:35:13
HEALTH CONDITIONS HAVE


[Captioner] 19:35:15
COMPLAINED ABOUT USING THE LONG


[Captioner] 19:35:15
ROUTE.


[Captioner] 19:35:18
SOME PEOPLE ARE USING THE


[Captioner] 19:35:19
SHORTCUT WITHOUT PERMISSION AND


[Captioner] 19:35:19
TRESPASSING.


[Captioner] 19:35:22
BUILDING THE BRIDGE WILL PREVENT


[Captioner] 19:35:22
THIS.


[Captioner] 19:35:24
NO ONE WILL HAVE TO WALK ON THE


[Captioner] 19:35:25
ROCKS IN THE CREEKS ANYMORE.


[Captioner] 19:35:26
THIS IS SAFER.


[Captioner] 19:35:29
I HOPE THAT YOU COULD LOOK INTO


[Captioner] 19:35:29
THIS SOON.


[Captioner] 19:35:39
AND I'M PRETTY SERIOUS ABOUT


[Captioner] 19:35:40
THIS BECAUSE I GOT TRIGGERED


[Captioner] 19:35:41
ABOUT THIS ON MY BAD DAYS.


[Captioner] 19:35:43
THAT'S WHY I WROTE TO THE CITY


[Captioner] 19:35:45
EARLIER ABOUT THIS.


[Captioner] 19:35:48
THIS IS LIKE IN JANUARY 2017, I


[Captioner] 19:35:49
SENT AN ESSAY TO THE CITY ABOUT


[Captioner] 19:35:51
THIS MATTER.


[Captioner] 19:35:55
JANUARY 2023, I MEAN.


[Captioner] 19:35:58
JANUARY 2023, I MEAN.


[Captioner] 19:36:03
SO CAN YOU LOOK INTO THIS SOON?


[Captioner] 19:36:20
>> Ms. Gauthier: WE'LL GO ON


[Captioner] 19:36:22
TO THE NEXT SPEAKER IN PERSON.


[Captioner] 19:36:28
CELINE MASTEN.


[Captioner] 19:36:34
>> GOOD EVENING, MAYOR AND THE


[Captioner] 19:36:35
CITY COUNCIL.


[Captioner] 19:36:38
I HAVE THREE POINTS.


[Captioner] 19:36:43
NUMBER ONE, WE SHOULD HAVE THE


[Captioner] 19:36:45
CITY DEPARTMENT OPEN ALL FIVE


[Captioner] 19:36:46
DAYS INSTEAD OF TWO DAYS OR ONE


[Captioner] 19:36:47
DAY OR THREE DAYS.


[Captioner] 19:36:51
IT IS CAUSING SOME PROBLEMS.


[Captioner] 19:36:56
SO ALL FIVE DAYS, THE CITY


[Captioner] 19:36:57
SHOULD BE OPEN TO THE PUBLIC.


[Captioner] 19:37:01
NUMBER TWO ON THE HOUSING,


[Captioner] 19:37:03
HOMELESS SITUATION, EVERYBODY


[Captioner] 19:37:04
TALK ABOUT A PROBLEM.


[Captioner] 19:37:05
WE NEED SOLUTIONS.


[Captioner] 19:37:10
AND MY SOLUTIONS ARE:  HAVE


[Captioner] 19:37:12
FACILITIES PROVIDED TO THE


[Captioner] 19:37:14
HOMELESS PEOPLE LIKE PORTABLE


[Captioner] 19:37:17
POTTIES, WATER TRUCKS, GARBAGE


[Captioner] 19:37:17
PICKUP.


[Captioner] 19:37:20
WE FEED THE HOMELESS PEOPLE HOT


[Captioner] 19:37:22
MEALS, WE'VE BEEN DOING IT FOR


[Captioner] 19:37:24
THE LAST TWO YEARS, AND WE


[Captioner] 19:37:25
ACTUALLY GO AND VISIT THEM.


[Captioner] 19:37:30
TO PROVIDE HOT MEALS.


[Captioner] 19:37:31
TO TALK TO THEM.


[Captioner] 19:37:33
EVERYBODY WHO HAS ISSUES WITH


[Captioner] 19:37:35
THE HOMELESS ARE TRUE.


[Captioner] 19:37:39
THE GARBAGE, THE DIRT, THE
FILTH.


[Captioner] 19:37:39
EVERYTHING IS THERE.


[Captioner] 19:37:43
SO I DON'T BELIEVE IN JUST


[Captioner] 19:37:45
CAUSING THESE TALKS THAT THIS IS


[Captioner] 19:37:46
A PROBLEM, THAT IS A PROBLEM.


[Captioner] 19:37:47
THIS IS A SOLUTION.


[Captioner] 19:37:52
GET CITY TO CLEAN UP, YOU PAY


[Captioner] 19:37:55
PEOPLE, YOU ASK THIS GARBAGE


[Captioner] 19:37:58
TRUCK COMPANIES, YOU GET PEOPLE


[Captioner] 19:37:59
TO TAKE CARE OF THIS MATTER.


[Captioner] 19:38:03
IF NOT, THIS WILL BECOME AN


[Captioner] 19:38:04
AVALANCHE WHERE MORE AND MORE


[Captioner] 19:38:06
PEOPLE WILL BE DISTURBED, AND


[Captioner] 19:38:08
THEY WILL KEEP COMING AGAIN AND


[Captioner] 19:38:08
AGAIN.


[Captioner] 19:38:12
THE LAST POINT IS THAT NEXT


[Captioner] 19:38:16
WEEK, WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT


[Captioner] 19:38:17
THE HOMES FOR THE HOMELESS.


[Captioner] 19:38:21
I WANT TO MAKE AN OBSERVATION.


[Captioner] 19:38:25
WE CAN BUILD 200 LOW-COST HOUSES


[Captioner] 19:38:26
FOR HALF THE MONEY THAT IS GOING


[Captioner] 19:38:28
TO BE SPENT ON THE MOTEL 6.


[Captioner] 19:38:33
AND WE CAN OPEN A HOMELESS -- A


[Captioner] 19:38:35
BATTERED WOMEN HOME FOR


[Captioner] 19:38:35
$5 MILLION, 30 WOMEN.


[Captioner] 19:38:36
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:38:38
>> Ms. Gauthier: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:38:42
MOSHE FOOS, FOLLOWED BY DUNCAN


[Captioner] 19:38:42
HARRIS.


[Captioner] 19:38:45
>> GOOD EVENING.


[Captioner] 19:38:49
MY NAME IS MOSHE FOSS, I AM ONE


[Captioner] 19:38:51
OF THE RABBIS AND DIRECTOR OF


[Captioner] 19:38:52
THE FREMONT JEWISH COMMUNITY
CENTER.


[Captioner] 19:38:54
THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR SERVICE


[Captioner] 19:38:56
AND BETTERING OUR COMMUNITY AND


[Captioner] 19:38:56
MAKING OUR COMMUNITY THE


[Captioner] 19:38:57
HAPPIEST CITY IN THE UNITED
STATES.


[Captioner] 19:39:03
I'M HERE TO BRING UP A SMALL


[Captioner] 19:39:05
POINT ABOUT THE WONDERFUL NEW


[Captioner] 19:39:07
PARK THAT -- DUSTERBERRY PARK


[Captioner] 19:39:08
THAT WILL BE OPENING HOPEFULLY


[Captioner] 19:39:09
SOON, WHICH WE'RE ALL VERY


[Captioner] 19:39:10
EXCITED ABOUT.


[Captioner] 19:39:13
JUST A POINT OF SAFETY THAT


[Captioner] 19:39:15
COULD IMPROVE IN OUR CITY


[Captioner] 19:39:18
SAFETY, WHICH I NOTICED THAT


[Captioner] 19:39:19
ACTUALLY JUST TODAY, I WAS


[Captioner] 19:39:20
LOOKING OUT THE WINDOW.


[Captioner] 19:39:22
OUR CENTER IS IMMEDIATELY ACROSS


[Captioner] 19:39:24
THE STREET FROM THE NEW PARK,


[Captioner] 19:39:25
DUSTERBERRY, AND I WAS LOOKING


[Captioner] 19:39:27
OUT THE WINDOW AND SOMEONE WAS


[Captioner] 19:39:29
ON A SCOOTER, AND THEY WERE


[Captioner] 19:39:30
CROSSING THE STREET IN THE


[Captioner] 19:39:33
MIDDLE OF PERALTA RIGHT


[Captioner] 19:39:33
IMMEDIATELY ACROSS THE STREET


[Captioner] 19:39:34
FROM THE PARK, IN BETWEEN THE


[Captioner] 19:39:38
PARK AND OUR CENTER, AND IT'S A


[Captioner] 19:39:41
TWO-WAY LANE IN EACH DIRECTION,


[Captioner] 19:39:42
SO IT'S A FOUR-LANE STREET.


[Captioner] 19:39:45
SOME CARS GO REALLY QUICKLY


[Captioner] 19:39:45
SOMETIMES.


[Captioner] 19:39:51
AND THIS SCOOTERRIST FELL IN THE


[Captioner] 19:39:52
MIDDLE OF THE STREET AND I'M


[Captioner] 19:39:54
GLAD THAT HE WAS SAFE AND NO CAR


[Captioner] 19:39:55
WAS SPEEDING AT THAT TIME.


[Captioner] 19:39:59
BUT IT BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION,


[Captioner] 19:40:02
AND IT ENCOURAGED ME TONIGHT TO


[Captioner] 19:40:04
COME HERE TONIGHT THAT IF WE


[Captioner] 19:40:06
WERE JUST TO ADD A CROSSWALK


[Captioner] 19:40:08
BECAUSE IT'S A VERY FAR DISTANCE


[Captioner] 19:40:10
FROM DUSTERBERRY ALL THE


[Captioner] 19:40:12
WAY UNTIL FREMONT BOULEVARD, SO


[Captioner] 19:40:13
PEOPLE DON'T REALLY WANT TO GO


[Captioner] 19:40:15
OUT OF THE WAY TO CROSS TO THE


[Captioner] 19:40:17
PARK, ESPECIALLY NOW THAT WE'RE


[Captioner] 19:40:19
ADDING ANOTHER PARK, I'M CERTAIN


[Captioner] 19:40:21
THAT PEOPLE ARE WANTING TO GO TO


[Captioner] 19:40:22
THE PARK AND CHILDREN THAT


[Captioner] 19:40:24
ATTEND OUR CENTER OF COURSE WILL


[Captioner] 19:40:27
CROSS INTO THE


[Captioner] 19:40:28
MIDDLE AND I THINK IT WOULD ADD


[Captioner] 19:40:28
A LOT OF SECURITY.


[Captioner] 19:40:29
SO THANK YOU SO MUCH.


[Captioner] 19:40:30
>> Ms. Gauthier: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:40:32
THE NEXT SPEAKER IS DUNCAN


[Captioner] 19:40:35
HARRIS, FOLLOWED BY KENDRA
TOYE.


[Captioner] 19:40:39
>> GOOD EVENING, MAYOR AND
COUNCIL.


[Captioner] 19:40:41
I JUST WANTED TO COME BY TO ALSO


[Captioner] 19:40:43
ECHO MY FELLOW CYCLISTS.


[Captioner] 19:40:46
I LOVE CYCLING AROUND FREMONT


[Captioner] 19:40:48
BECAUSE THE FACILITIES ARE WAY


[Captioner] 19:40:49
BETTER THAN WHERE I PREVIOUSLY
LIVED.


[Captioner] 19:40:51
UNFORTUNATELY, THEY STILL COULD


[Captioner] 19:40:52
USE SOME IMPROVEMENT.


[Captioner] 19:40:55
WHENEVER I GO TO, SAY, DOWNTOWN


[Captioner] 19:40:56
NILES, THERE'S BASICALLY NOWHERE


[Captioner] 19:40:57
TO PARK MY BIKE.


[Captioner] 19:41:00
WE'VE GOT PLENTY OF ROOM TO PARK


[Captioner] 19:41:01
CARS JUST ALL OVER THE PLACE.


[Captioner] 19:41:03
BUT THERE'S BASICALLY NOWHERE TO


[Captioner] 19:41:05
LOCK UP, SO I CAN'T LEAVE MY


[Captioner] 19:41:06
BIKE EFFECTIVELY, MEANING I NEED


[Captioner] 19:41:07
TO WALK AROUND WITH IT.


[Captioner] 19:41:10
ALSO, WHEN I AM BIKING AROUND


[Captioner] 19:41:13
THE CITY, OFTEN I'M ON OUR BIKE


[Captioner] 19:41:16
LANES, AND THESE ARE FULL


[Captioner] 19:41:16
TRAFFIC LANES.


[Captioner] 19:41:18
I SHOULD BE ABLE TO TREAT THEM


[Captioner] 19:41:21
AS SUCH, BUT I WILL OFTEN FIND


[Captioner] 19:41:22
DELIVERY VEHICLES JUST PARKED IN


[Captioner] 19:41:24
THEM, AND THIS CAN BE SOMEWHAT


[Captioner] 19:41:26
DIFFICULT TO MANEUVER AROUND


[Captioner] 19:41:27
BECAUSE I'LL BE ON MOWRY OR


[Captioner] 19:41:29
SOMETHING, WHICH IS A 50-MILE AN


[Captioner] 19:41:31
HOUR ROAD, AND I'LL NEED TO


[Captioner] 19:41:32
MERGE INTO 50-MILE AN HOUR


[Captioner] 19:41:34
TRAFFIC TO GO AROUND THESE


[Captioner] 19:41:35
VEHICLES, AND THAT'S NOT


[Captioner] 19:41:35
TERRIBLY SAFE.


[Captioner] 19:41:40
ALSO, I LIVE RIGHT OFF PERALTA


[Captioner] 19:41:42
BOULEVARD, IN THE AREA WHERE


[Captioner] 19:41:44
THERE'S THE PERALTA IMPROVEMENT


[Captioner] 19:41:45
PROJECT, RIGHT NEAR WHERE ONE OF


[Captioner] 19:41:47
THE CYCLISTS WAS UNFORTUNATELY


[Captioner] 19:41:48
KILLED LAST WEEK, AND I JUST


[Captioner] 19:41:50
WANTED TO EMPHASIZE THAT WE


[Captioner] 19:41:53
SHOULD IMPROVE OUR BIKING


[Captioner] 19:41:55
INFRASTRUCTURE FURTHER BECAUSE


[Captioner] 19:41:58
IT'S JUST STILL NOT GOOD ENOUGH,


[Captioner] 19:42:00
AND WE COULD GET OUR SEPARATION


[Captioner] 19:42:01
AND EVERYTHING EVEN BETTER AND


[Captioner] 19:42:02
KEEP OUR CITIZENS SAFER.


[Captioner] 19:42:05
I HAVE A RECUMBENT TRIKE AS ONE


[Captioner] 19:42:07
OF OUR OTHER PEOPLE MENTIONED,


[Captioner] 19:42:09
AND THEY'RE LOVELY VEHICLES BUT


[Captioner] 19:42:11
THEY'RE ALSO HILARIOUSLY HARD TO


[Captioner] 19:42:13
SEE AND I DO NOT FEEL SAFE


[Captioner] 19:42:14
RIDING IT IN OUR FAIR CITY.


[Captioner] 19:42:16
WHICH MAKES ME VERY SAD BECAUSE


[Captioner] 19:42:18
I'D BE A LOT MORE COMFORTABLE IF


[Captioner] 19:42:18
I WAS IN THAT.


[Captioner] 19:42:19
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:42:22
>> Ms. Gauthier: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:42:25
THE NEXT SPEAKER IS KENDRA TOYE,


[Captioner] 19:42:28
FOLLOWED BY NGUYEN KAGAYAMA.


[Captioner] 19:42:33
>> GOOD EVENING, MAYOR AND
COUNCIL.


[Captioner] 19:42:36
MY NAME IS KENDRA TO.


[Captioner] 19:42:38
YE, I'M A LIFETIME FREMONT BORN


[Captioner] 19:42:40
AND RAISED AND RESIDENT OF


[Captioner] 19:42:41
DISTRICT 2, AND I ALSO WANTED TO


[Captioner] 19:42:43
ECHO SOME OF THE COMMENTS MADE


[Captioner] 19:42:47
BY MY CYCLIST BICYCLE FRIENDS


[Captioner] 19:42:48
WHO SPOKE TONIGHT TO THANK YOU


[Captioner] 19:42:50
FOR THE PROCLAMATION FOR BIKE
MONTH.


[Captioner] 19:42:54
AN EARLIER SPEAKER BROUGHT UP


[Captioner] 19:42:56
HOW TO CHANGE THE CULTURE AROUND


[Captioner] 19:43:00
BIKING, AND TO MOVE FOR MORE


[Captioner] 19:43:01
CAR-CENTRIC MODES TO MORE ACTIVE


[Captioner] 19:43:02
TRANSPORTATION, AND I WANTED TO


[Captioner] 19:43:03
LET YOU KNOW THAT I'M ONE OF


[Captioner] 19:43:06
THOSE PEOPLE THAT THE CHANGES IN


[Captioner] 19:43:08
THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT YOU'VE


[Captioner] 19:43:09
SUPPORTED HAS GOTTEN ME TO RIDE


[Captioner] 19:43:09
A BIKE.


[Captioner] 19:43:12
I STARTED RIDING A BIKE FOR THE


[Captioner] 19:43:13
FIRST TIME SINCE I WAS A CHILD


[Captioner] 19:43:14
LAST AUGUST, SPECIFICALLY


[Captioner] 19:43:16
BECAUSE OF ALL OF THE


[Captioner] 19:43:18
IMPROVEMENTS THAT THE CITY OF


[Captioner] 19:43:18
FREMONT HAS MADE.


[Captioner] 19:43:20
I SAW THE BIKE LANES BEING PUT


[Captioner] 19:43:22
IN AND DECIDED I SHOULD TRY TO


[Captioner] 19:43:24
PUT THEM TO EU AND BICYCLING HAS


[Captioner] 19:43:26
BEEN SO GRADE FOR MY MOOD, MY


[Captioner] 19:43:27
HEALTH AND FOR ME GETTING AROUND


[Captioner] 19:43:29
AND SAVING MONEY, AND OF COURSE


[Captioner] 19:43:30
THERE'S ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT IN


[Captioner] 19:43:32
A LOT OF AREAS, LIKE OTHER


[Captioner] 19:43:34
PEOPLE HAVE MENTIONED, AND I'M


[Captioner] 19:43:35
SURE YOU'RE BECOMING MORE AND


[Captioner] 19:43:38
MORE AWARE OF, BUT I WANTED TO


[Captioner] 19:43:39
THANK YOU AND TO ENCOURAGE YOU


[Captioner] 19:43:42
TO KEEP UP THE MOMENTUM THAT AS


[Captioner] 19:43:43
YOU CONTINUE TO MAKE THESE


[Captioner] 19:43:44
CHANGES, YOU'LL START TO GET


[Captioner] 19:43:45
MORE AND MORE PEOPLE LIKE ME


[Captioner] 19:43:47
EVERY DAY CITIZENS OF FREMONT


[Captioner] 19:43:48
WHO ARE GETTING OUT OF THEIR


[Captioner] 19:43:50
CARS AND ON TO THEIR BIKES.


[Captioner] 19:43:51
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:43:52
>> Ms. Gauthier: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:43:58
NGUYEN KAGAYAMA.


[Captioner] 19:44:03
>> CITY COUNCIL, MY NAME IS
NGUYEN.


[Captioner] 19:44:05
I'M A LEAGUE CYCLING INSTRUCTOR


[Captioner] 19:44:07

FREMONT FREEWHEELERS BICYCLE


[Captioner] 19:44:14
CLUB, AND ONE OF THE INITIATIVES


[Captioner] 19:44:16
I'VE BEEN WORKING ON FOR THE


[Captioner] 19:44:19
LAST NUMBER OF YEARS WITH BIKE


[Captioner] 19:44:21
FREMONT AND FREMONT FREEWHEELERS


[Captioner] 19:44:22
BICYCLE CLUB IS A PROGRAM YOU


[Captioner] 19:44:24
MIGHT HAVE HEARD ABOUT CALLED


[Captioner] 19:44:25
FIX YOUR BIKE DAY, AND WE DO


[Captioner] 19:44:28
THAT AT THE IRVINGTON FARMERS


[Captioner] 19:44:35
MARKET, AND IT'S ALWAYS A 


[Captioner] 19:44:36
WELL-ATTENDED EVENT, AND WITH


[Captioner] 19:44:40
OUR VOLUNTEERS, WE'VE BEEN ABLE


[Captioner] 19:44:42
TO FIX HUNDREDS OF BIKES IN THE


[Captioner] 19:44:42
PROCESS.


[Captioner] 19:44:45
WHAT I'D LIKE TO TALK TO YOU


[Captioner] 19:44:47
ABOUT IS LEVEL OF SERVICE ON


[Captioner] 19:44:50
YOUR BICYCLE FACILITIES.


[Captioner] 19:44:53
OR LACK.


[Captioner] 19:44:57
AND SO THE CITY HAS BEEN PUTTING


[Captioner] 19:44:59
IN THESE BIKE LANES.


[Captioner] 19:45:01
AFTER A STORM, YOU MAY BE AWARE


[Captioner] 19:45:03
OR NOT AWARE THAT IT'S CLOGGED


[Captioner] 19:45:03
WITH DEBRIS.


[Captioner] 19:45:06
AND IF YOU HAVE A LEVEL OF


[Captioner] 19:45:08
SERVICE OF ONCE A MONTH OR TWICE


[Captioner] 19:45:10
A MONTH, WHERE YOU PUT A STREET


[Captioner] 19:45:12
SWEEPER THROUGH IT, THAT REALLY


[Captioner] 19:45:13
IS INSUFFICIENT.


[Captioner] 19:45:16
AND I WOULD RECOMMEND THAT


[Captioner] 19:45:18
BEFORE YOU APPROVE A PROJECT IN


[Captioner] 19:45:21
THE FUTURE, ASK ABOUT LEVEL OF


[Captioner] 19:45:21
SERVICE.


[Captioner] 19:45:24
WHAT HAPPENS AFTER A RAIN AND A


[Captioner] 19:45:26
TREE FALLS, NOW WHAT?


[Captioner] 19:45:29
WHEN IS THE CITY GOING TO COME


[Captioner] 19:45:32
OUT AND CLEAN THE SURFACE SO


[Captioner] 19:45:33
THAT IT'S SAFE FOR CYCLISTS TO
USE?


[Captioner] 19:45:38
AND WITH THAT, I THANK YOU VERY
MUCH.


[Captioner] 19:45:43
>> Ms. Gauthier: MAYOR, THAT'S


[Captioner] 19:45:44
THE LAST SPEAKER.


[Captioner] 19:45:46

[Captioner] 19:50:07
[APPLAUSE]


[Captioner] 19:50:17
>> THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:50:47
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU SO
MUCH.


[Captioner] 19:50:49
I'M VERY GLAD TO SEE THAT WE


[Captioner] 19:50:50
HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE


[Captioner] 19:50:52
ENGINEERING AND BUILDING NEW


[Captioner] 19:50:53
WAYS TO ADDRESS THE FUTURE.


[Captioner] 19:50:55
IT'S BEEN A LOT OF FUN FOR ME TO


[Captioner] 19:50:58
WATCH OVER THE YEARS TOO.


[Captioner] 19:51:02
MANY, MANY YEARS AGO, I GOT TO


[Captioner] 19:51:03
COACH SOME OF THESE TEAMS SO


[Captioner] 19:51:05
IT'S FUN TO SEE OUR NEXT


[Captioner] 19:51:05
GENERATION CONTINUING THE WORK.


[Captioner] 19:51:07
NEXT IS THE ITEM THAT'S PULLED


[Captioner] 19:51:08
FROM THE CONSENT CALENDAR.


[Captioner] 19:51:15
AND THAT WAS ITEM 2M AS IN


[Captioner] 19:51:15
MOVING, OR MOTOR.


[Captioner] 19:51:21
MULTIMODAL.


[Captioner] 19:51:25
SO WE HAD SOMEONE PULL THE ITEM,


[Captioner] 19:51:25
I THINK.


[Captioner] 19:51:27
>> Ms. Gauthier: WE HAVE THREE


[Captioner] 19:51:28
SPEAKER CARDS.


[Captioner] 19:51:29
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY.


[Captioner] 19:51:31
THERE WAS AN INDIVIDUAL WHO


[Captioner] 19:51:33
PULLED THE ITEM, I APOLOGIZE, I


[Captioner] 19:51:33
DON'T HAVE THEIR NAME.


[Captioner] 19:51:35
>> Ms. Gauthier: THERE ARE


[Captioner] 19:51:36
THREE SPEAKER CARDS ON IT.


[Captioner] 19:51:38
THE FIRST SPEAKER IS KEITH


[Captioner] 19:51:39
PARKER.


[Captioner] 19:51:41
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:51:43
>> Ms. Gauthier: SORRY, FOUR


[Captioner] 19:51:44
SPEAKER CARDS AND A HAND RAISED


[Captioner] 19:51:44
IN ZOOM.


[Captioner] 19:51:47
MR. PARKER?


[Captioner] 19:51:49
>> Mayor Mei: WELCOME.


[Captioner] 19:52:00
>> I'VE SPOKEN REPEATEDLY ABOUT


[Captioner] 19:52:02
HOW VISION ZERO HAS NOT REDUCED


[Captioner] 19:52:02
FATALITIES.


[Captioner] 19:52:04
IN TWEP 15, THE VEHICULAR


[Captioner] 19:52:05
MORTALITY RATE PER HUNDRED


[Captioner] 19:52:06
THOUSAND RESIDENTS WAS 5.88.


[Captioner] 19:52:08
IN 2022, IT WAS 6.


[Captioner] 19:52:11
I DON'T CLAIM TO BE GREAT AT


[Captioner] 19:52:12
MATH BUT I'M PRETTY SURE THAT


[Captioner] 19:52:12
6 IS MORE.


[Captioner] 19:52:15
AS FOR THE PROPOSAL TO REPLACE


[Captioner] 19:52:17
SOME OF THE BOLLARDS THAT


[Captioner] 19:52:18
EVERYONE LOVES SO MUCH WITH


[Captioner] 19:52:19
CONCRETE BARRIER, THREE REASONS


[Captioner] 19:52:20
WERE GIVEN FOR THIS.


[Captioner] 19:52:22
IT SEEMS THAT THE BOLLARDS ARE


[Captioner] 19:52:24
NOT DURABLE WHEN STRUCK BY


[Captioner] 19:52:26
VEHICLES, ARE NOT ESTHETICALLY


[Captioner] 19:52:28
PLEASING, AND ARE NOT SUFFICIENT


[Captioner] 19:52:29
TO PROVIDE THE COMFORT THAT


[Captioner] 19:52:29
RIDERS SEEK.


[Captioner] 19:52:32
LET'S LOOK AT EACH OF THESE.


[Captioner] 19:52:34
NOT DURABLE WHEN STRUCK BY
VEHICLES.


[Captioner] 19:52:35
NOW IF CARS ARE HITTING THEM,


[Captioner] 19:52:37
THINK ABOUT WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF


[Captioner] 19:52:38
WE REPLACE THEM WITH CONCRETE


[Captioner] 19:52:39
AND THEN CARS HIT THEM.


[Captioner] 19:52:40
PROBABLY NOT WHAT WE WANT.


[Captioner] 19:52:43
THE NEXT POINT IS THAT THEY ARE


[Captioner] 19:52:43
NOT ESTHETICALLY PLEASING.


[Captioner] 19:52:44
WHICH IS TRUE.


[Captioner] 19:52:48
BUT I THINK -- TELL ME IF YOU


[Captioner] 19:52:49
DISAGREE, RIGHTSLY HARD TO LOOK


[Captioner] 19:52:51
AT SOMETHING AND SAY YOU KNOW


[Captioner] 19:52:52
WHAT WOULD REALLY MAKE THAT LOOK


[Captioner] 19:52:52
BETTER?


[Captioner] 19:52:53
CONCRETE.


[Captioner] 19:52:54
AND THE FINAL POINT, WHICH IS


[Captioner] 19:52:56
THAT BOLLARDS ARE NOT SUFFICIENT


[Captioner] 19:52:57
TO PROVIDE THAT COMFORT THAT


[Captioner] 19:52:58
RIDERS SEEK, AND THIS IS REALLY


[Captioner] 19:53:00
WHAT THIS IS ABOUT, IT'S ABOUT


[Captioner] 19:53:03
GETTING PEOPLE OUT OF CARS AND


[Captioner] 19:53:03
USING BIKES.


[Captioner] 19:53:05
THE IDEA IS THAT IF PEOPLE FEEL


[Captioner] 19:53:06
COMFORTABLE ENOUGH, THEY WILL


[Captioner] 19:53:08
GIVE UP THEIR CARS AND RIDE


[Captioner] 19:53:09
THEIR BIKES TO GET AROUND SO WE


[Captioner] 19:53:11
BUILT THESE GREAT BIKE LANES SO


[Captioner] 19:53:12
PEOPLE WOULD FEEL COMFORTABLE


[Captioner] 19:53:13
AND START BIKING BUT FOR THE


[Captioner] 19:53:14
MOST PART, THEY DIDN'T.


[Captioner] 19:53:16
THIS PROPOSAL SAYS WELL, WE JUST


[Captioner] 19:53:17
DIDN'T MAKE THEM COMFORTABLE
ENOUGH.


[Captioner] 19:53:19
BUT WHAT IF THAT'S NOT THE
ISSUE?


[Captioner] 19:53:24
WHAT IF THE ISSUE IS THAT WE 


[Captioner] 19:53:26
ARE -- PEOPLE THAT COMMUTE LONG


[Captioner] 19:53:27
DISTANCES EITHER TO SAN JOSÉ AND


[Captioner] 19:53:28
BEYOND OR ACROSS THE BAY AND


[Captioner] 19:53:30
TAKING BIKES JUST ISN'T
PRACTICAL.


[Captioner] 19:53:30
MAYBE THAT'S IT.


[Captioner] 19:53:33
SO LET ME ASK YOU ONE QUESTION.


[Captioner] 19:53:36
IS IT THAT WHAT EACH OF YOU ARE


[Captioner] 19:53:36
WAITING FOR?


[Captioner] 19:53:38
ARE YOU ALL JUST EAGER TO GET


[Captioner] 19:53:39
RID OF YOUR CARS JUST WAITING TO


[Captioner] 19:53:41
THROW THEM ON THE SCRAP HEAP AND


[Captioner] 19:53:43
HOP OP YOUR BICYCLES TO GET ALL


[Captioner] 19:53:44
AROUND TOWN IF ONLY THE BIKE


[Captioner] 19:53:46
LANES WERE A LITTLE MORE
COMFORTABLE?


[Captioner] 19:53:48
YEAH, NEITHER IS ANYONE ELSE


[Captioner] 19:53:49
WHICH BRINGS ME TO MY FINAL


[Captioner] 19:53:52
POINT, THERE HAVE BEEN INCIDENTS


[Captioner] 19:53:53
WHERE FIRST RESPONDERS HAD TO


[Captioner] 19:53:55
DRIVE OVER THE BOLLARDS BECAUSE


[Captioner] 19:53:55
PEOPLE COULDN'T GET OUT OF THE


[Captioner] 19:53:56
WAY BECAUSE OF THE BOLLARDS.


[Captioner] 19:53:58
HOW IS THAT GOING TO WORK IF WE


[Captioner] 19:53:59
PUT IN CONCRETE?


[Captioner] 19:54:00
LET'S NOT DO THIS.


[Captioner] 19:54:01
>> Ms. Gauthier: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:54:03
THE NEXT SPEAKER IS ANDREAS


[Captioner] 19:54:03
KADAVANICH.


[Captioner] 19:54:14
>> GOOD EVENING, ANDREAS


[Captioner] 19:54:14
KADAVANICH, BIKE FREMONT.


[Captioner] 19:54:17
I'VE BEEN COMING TO THESE


[Captioner] 19:54:20
MEETINGS FOR 15 OR SO YEARS WHEN


[Captioner] 19:54:22
THESE ISSUES COME UP, AND YOU


[Captioner] 19:54:25
KNOW, I SEE THE PATTERN.


[Captioner] 19:54:27
EVERY TIME ONE OF THESE PROJECTS


[Captioner] 19:54:31
COMES UP THAT TRIES TO DO


[Captioner] 19:54:32
IMPROVEMENT FOR BIKE SAFETY OR


[Captioner] 19:54:33
PEDESTRIAN SAFETY OR ANYTHING


[Captioner] 19:54:34
REALLY, VISION ZERO, IT'S ALWAYS


[Captioner] 19:54:36
THE SAME, TWO THINGS STAND OUT.


[Captioner] 19:54:40
PEOPLE ARE OPPOSED TO IT MAKE UP


[Captioner] 19:54:40
DATA.


[Captioner] 19:54:42
I LOOKED THROUGH THE EMAILS


[Captioner] 19:54:43
TODAY THAT WERE SENT TO YOU.


[Captioner] 19:54:46
I MEAN, THERE ARE CLAIMS IN


[Captioner] 19:54:47
THERE, THEY'RE NOT BACKED UP BY


[Captioner] 19:54:48
ANY EVIDENCE.


[Captioner] 19:54:49
AND IT'S NOT JUST THIS PROJECT.


[Captioner] 19:54:51
IT'S A LOT OF PROJECTS.


[Captioner] 19:54:54
THE OTHER THING I HEAR A LOT IS


[Captioner] 19:54:57
THAT FREMONT CITY DID NOT GIVE


[Captioner] 19:54:58
ADVANCE NOTICE.


[Captioner] 19:55:01
THIS EXACT PROJECT, THEY SPENT


[Captioner] 19:55:02
ALMOST A LAST OUR AT THE LAST


[Captioner] 19:55:03
MOBILITY COMMISSION MEETING


[Captioner] 19:55:03
DISCUSSING THIS.


[Captioner] 19:55:05
THEY DISCUSSED ALL THESE SAFETY


[Captioner] 19:55:06
ASPECTS, HOW EMERGENCY VEHICLES


[Captioner] 19:55:08
WOULD GET AROUND IT, WHAT THE


[Captioner] 19:55:09
ALTERNATIVES ARE, WHY THIS IS


[Captioner] 19:55:11
THE BEST OPTION, HOW IT COMPLIES


[Captioner] 19:55:14
WITH EVERY SINGLE PLAN THAT THIS


[Captioner] 19:55:17
CITY HAS PASSED AFTER AN


[Captioner] 19:55:19
EXTENSIVE PUBLIC PROCESS OF


[Captioner] 19:55:22
REVIEW THAT THIS COUNCIL HAS


[Captioner] 19:55:22
CONSISTENTLY REAFFIRMED.


[Captioner] 19:55:28
WHAT HAPPENS IS, YEAH, THESE


[Captioner] 19:55:30
PEOPLE HAVE NOT SUCCEEDED ON THE


[Captioner] 19:55:34
MERITS, SO NOW THEY COME TO YOU,


[Captioner] 19:55:35
BYPASSING ALL THESE OTHER


[Captioner] 19:55:36
PROCESSES AND PROCEDURES AND


[Captioner] 19:55:38
THEY TRY TO SWAY YOU, YOU KNOW,


[Captioner] 19:55:39
BASICALLY ON POLITICAL GROUNDS


[Captioner] 19:55:40
AND BASICALLY JUST BY
SCREAMING.


[Captioner] 19:55:45
AND YES, I KNOW THAT'S HOW


[Captioner] 19:55:45
POLITICS WORKS.


[Captioner] 19:55:47
LIKE I SAID, I'VE BEEN DOING


[Captioner] 19:55:48
THIS FOR 15 YEARS.


[Captioner] 19:55:50
IT IS EXCEEDINGLY FRUSTRATING TO


[Captioner] 19:55:52
ME TO SEE US GET HUNG UP ON


[Captioner] 19:55:52
THESE THINGS.


[Captioner] 19:55:56
WHEN WE'VE SPENT SO MUCH TIME,


[Captioner] 19:55:59
MONEY, STAFF TIME ON


[Captioner] 19:56:00
EVIDENCE-BASED POLICIES THAT WE


[Captioner] 19:56:00
KNOW WORK.


[Captioner] 19:56:04
AND I WILL REITERATE, IF YOU


[Captioner] 19:56:07
LOOK AT THE DATA USING PROPER


[Captioner] 19:56:08
STATISTICAL METHODS, THE TREND


[Captioner] 19:56:08
IS CLEAR.


[Captioner] 19:56:11
WE ARE DOING SO MUCH BETTER THAN


[Captioner] 19:56:11
EVERYBODY ELSE.


[Captioner] 19:56:13
WHEN NUMBERS GO UP EVERYWHERE


[Captioner] 19:56:15
ELSE AND WE'RE STEADY, WE ARE


[Captioner] 19:56:15
DOING BETTER.


[Captioner] 19:56:19
SO LET'S NOT BACKTRACK, LET'S


[Captioner] 19:56:21
PASS THIS, LET JUST FOLLOW THE


[Captioner] 19:56:23
STAFF RECOMMENDATION AS REVIEWED


[Captioner] 19:56:24
BY THE MOBILITY COMMISSION, LIKE


[Captioner] 19:56:26
SO MANY OTHER PROJECTS, AND


[Captioner] 19:56:26
LET'S JUST GET THIS OVER WITH.


[Captioner] 19:56:29
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:56:33
[APPLAUSE]


[Captioner] 19:56:35
>> Ms. Gauthier: MAYOR, WE'RE


[Captioner] 19:56:36
GOING TO CALL ON A COUPLE OF THE


[Captioner] 19:56:37
ZOOM SPEAKERS.


[Captioner] 19:56:45
PADMA GOPALAKRISHNAN.


[Captioner] 19:56:46
>> GOOD EVENING, CAN YOU HEAR
ME?


[Captioner] 19:56:47
>> Mayor Mei: YES.


[Captioner] 19:56:48
>> OKAY.


[Captioner] 19:56:50
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:56:53
I'M A 20-PLUS YEAR RESIDENT OF


[Captioner] 19:56:54
FREMONT.


[Captioner] 19:56:56
THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO


[Captioner] 19:56:56
SPEAK TODAY.


[Captioner] 19:56:58
I'M HERE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION


[Captioner] 19:57:01
TO USING CONCRETE BARRIERS


[Captioner] 19:57:02
BETWEEN BIKE AND VEHICLE LANES.


[Captioner] 19:57:04
FIRSTLY, IS THIS ONLY REPLACING


[Captioner] 19:57:06
THE DAMAGED BOLLARDS ON PASEO


[Captioner] 19:57:09
PADRE, DRISCOLL AND FREMONT


[Captioner] 19:57:09
BOULEVARD?


[Captioner] 19:57:11
THE JUSTIFICATION GIVEN IS THAT


[Captioner] 19:57:12
THE BIKE USERS ARE NOT


[Captioner] 19:57:14
COMFORTABLE WITH PLASTIC


[Captioner] 19:57:17
BARRIERS AND THIS SOUNDS LIKE AN


[Captioner] 19:57:18
APPROVAL TO USE THEM VERY
WIDELY.


[Captioner] 19:57:20
SECONDLY THERE IS NO MENTION OF


[Captioner] 19:57:21
WHAT THIS BARRIER WOULD LOOK


[Captioner] 19:57:22
LIKE, WHAT ITS DIMENSIONS ARE.


[Captioner] 19:57:24
WHY SHOULD YOU ACCEPT A PROPOSAL


[Captioner] 19:57:26
WITH ONLY ONE OPTION FROM OUR


[Captioner] 19:57:27
DEPARTMENT?


[Captioner] 19:57:29
AND WE HEAR ABOUT THE MOBILITY


[Captioner] 19:57:33
COMMISSION, THERE'S THREE PEOPLE


[Captioner] 19:57:33
FOR TRANSIT.


[Captioner] 19:57:35
YOU TELL ME HOW MANY PEOPLE TAKE


[Captioner] 19:57:36
THE TRAIN VERSUS HOW MANY PEOPLE


[Captioner] 19:57:37
TAKE A CAR IN FREMONT.


[Captioner] 19:57:41
NEXT, FIRST THE LANES ARE NARROW


[Captioner] 19:57:42
UNDER THE GUISE OF LOWERING


[Captioner] 19:57:45
SPEEDS BUT THIS IS ONLY LED TO


[Captioner] 19:57:45
FRUSTRATING DRIVERS.


[Captioner] 19:57:47
PEOPLE ARE STILL SPEEDING AS YOU


[Captioner] 19:57:49
HAVE SEEN IN THE UNFORTUNATE


[Captioner] 19:57:50
INCIDENT, ACCIDENT ON BLACOW,


[Captioner] 19:57:54
WHERE A CAR WAS DRIVING AT


[Captioner] 19:57:55
90 MILES AND HOUR AND OUR


[Captioner] 19:57:56
FREMONT POLICE DEPARTMENT


[Captioner] 19:57:59
UNFORTUNATELY IS IGNORING


[Captioner] 19:58:00
TRAFFIC AND HENCE THERE ARE NO


[Captioner] 19:58:02
CONSEQUENCES FOR SUCH BAD
DRIVERS.


[Captioner] 19:58:05
CONCRETE BARRIERS WILL MAKE THIS


[Captioner] 19:58:07
PROBLEM EVEN WORSE BECAUSE THEY


[Captioner] 19:58:09
ARE RIGID AND THEY CAN CAUSE


[Captioner] 19:58:11
HEAVY DAMAGE UPON IMPACT AND


[Captioner] 19:58:12
MAKING A CRASH DEADLY FOR BIKES


[Captioner] 19:58:13
AND CAR USERS ALIKE.


[Captioner] 19:58:17
PLEASE ASK FOR MULTIPLE OPTIONS,


[Captioner] 19:58:23
INCLUDING RUMBLE STRIPS TO DETER


[Captioner] 19:58:24
CARS FROM STRAYING FROM THEIR


[Captioner] 19:58:25
LANES INTO THE BIKE LANES AND


[Captioner] 19:58:26
THAT IS WHAT THE PROBLEM IS.


[Captioner] 19:58:30
BY DOING THAT, THEY ENDANGER
BIKES.


[Captioner] 19:58:32
PLEASE ASK FOR OPTIONS THAT ARE


[Captioner] 19:58:33
NOT THE CONCRETE BARRIER.


[Captioner] 19:58:36
MAJOR TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS HAVE


[Captioner] 19:58:38
INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY AS SEEN


[Captioner] 19:58:39
BY THREE FATAL ACCIDENTS JUST IN


[Captioner] 19:58:39
THE LAST WEEK.


[Captioner] 19:58:45
PLEASE -- CHANGES TO OUR


[Captioner] 19:58:47
ROADS -- PLEASE INCREASE YOUR


[Captioner] 19:58:48
VISIBLE PRESENCE AND ENFORCE


[Captioner] 19:58:50
TRAFFIC LAWS --


[Captioner] 19:58:50
>> Ms. Gauthier: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:58:52
THE NEXT SPEAKER IS ROBERT
PRINZ.


[Captioner] 19:58:58
ON ZOOM.


[Captioner] 19:58:58
>> THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:59:02
THIS IS ROBERT PRINZ AGAIN WITH


[Captioner] 19:59:03
BIKE EAST BAY NOW ON AUDIO.


[Captioner] 19:59:06
I'D LIKE TO THANK STAFF FOR


[Captioner] 19:59:07
BRINGING THIS ITEM AND I HOPE


[Captioner] 19:59:07
COUNCIL WILL SUPPORT IT.


[Captioner] 19:59:10
THE TDA, TRANSPORTATION


[Captioner] 19:59:10
DEVELOPMENT ACT


[Captioner] 19:59:12
ARTICLE 3 FUNDING IS ONE OF THE


[Captioner] 19:59:13
CITY'S MOST FLEXIBLE FUNDING


[Captioner] 19:59:14
SOURCES FOR TRANSPORTATION


[Captioner] 19:59:16
INVESTMENTS ON BIKING AND


[Captioner] 19:59:17
WALKING, SO THIS IS A REALLY


[Captioner] 19:59:19
SMART WAY FOR THEM TO TRY TO


[Captioner] 19:59:21
APPLY THIS FUNDING, AND IT'S


[Captioner] 19:59:24
AVAILABLE ON AN ONGOING BASIS SO


[Captioner] 19:59:26
IF THIS PROJECT IS A SUCCESS, IT


[Captioner] 19:59:28
COULD BE REPLICATED IN FUTURE


[Captioner] 19:59:30
YEARS ON ADDITIONAL CORRIDORS AS


[Captioner] 19:59:30
WELL.


[Captioner] 19:59:35
WE'RE SEEING A LOT OF CITIES


[Captioner] 19:59:36
UPGRADING TO CONCRETE.


[Captioner] 19:59:39
THEY WERE INITIALLY INSTALLED ON


[Captioner] 19:59:40
A TRIAL BASIS TO SEE HOW THEY
WORK.


[Captioner] 19:59:42
MOST OF THEM ARE WORKING AND NOW


[Captioner] 19:59:43
THEY'RE GETTING UPGRADED.


[Captioner] 19:59:45
IT'S CALLED A PROTECTED BIKEWAY


[Captioner] 19:59:46
NOT TO PROTECT CARS FROM BIKE


[Captioner] 19:59:48
RIDERS BUT TO PROTECT BIKE


[Captioner] 19:59:48
RIDERS FROM CARS.


[Captioner] 19:59:51
FLEX POSTS ARE DESIGNED TO BE


[Captioner] 19:59:53
DRIVEN OVER AND SO OBVIOUSLY THE


[Captioner] 19:59:54
CONCRETE WILL PROVIDE MORE


[Captioner] 19:59:56
PROTECTION ON THAT FACILITY.


[Captioner] 19:59:59
I'D ALSO NOTE THAT SOME OF THE


[Captioner] 20:00:01
MOST RECENT GUIDANCE THAT WE


[Captioner] 20:00:04
HAVE ON THIS IS FROM NACTO, THE


[Captioner] 20:00:06
NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF CITY


[Captioner] 20:00:07
TRANSPORTATION OFFICIALS THAT


[Captioner] 20:00:09
PUTS OUT A GUIDE DIRECTING --


[Captioner] 20:00:12
WITH THE MOST RECENT


[Captioner] 20:00:13
RECOMMENDATIONS ON PROTECTIVE


[Captioner] 20:00:15
BIKEWAYS IS FROM THEIR URBAN


[Captioner] 20:00:18
BIKEWAY DESIGN GUIDE UPDATED IN


[Captioner] 20:00:20
JUST MARCH OF IN YEAR THAT


[Captioner] 20:00:22
RECOMMENDS ANY HIGH SPEED


[Captioner] 20:00:23
STREETS AT 30 MILES PER HOUR OR


[Captioner] 20:00:26
HIGHER TO USE EITHER CONCRETE


[Captioner] 20:00:28
OR -- CONCRETE MEDIAN OR K RAIL


[Captioner] 20:00:29
PROTECTION AS OPPOSED TO FLEX
POSTS.


[Captioner] 20:00:31
SO STAFF WITH THE RECOMMENDATION


[Captioner] 20:00:33
IS FOLLOWING THIS RECENT


[Captioner] 20:00:34
GUIDANCE AND I REALLY HIGHLY


[Captioner] 20:00:36
RECOMMEND THAT COUNCIL SUPPORT


[Captioner] 20:00:36
THAT AS WELL.


[Captioner] 20:00:39
IF THERE IS A CONCERN FROM


[Captioner] 20:00:40
DRIVERS ABOUT POTENTIALLY


[Captioner] 20:00:44
DRIVING INTO THE CURBS AND WANT


[Captioner] 20:00:46
TO USE A RUMBLE STRIP, I WOULD


[Captioner] 20:00:47
RECOMMEND PUTTING THAT TO THE


[Captioner] 20:00:53
LEFT OF THE CONCRETE CURBS AS


[Captioner] 20:00:54
OPPOSED TO AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE


[Captioner] 20:00:55
CONCRETE CURBS.


[Captioner] 20:00:56
JUST ONE SUGGESTION.


[Captioner] 20:00:56
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:00:57
>> Ms. Gauthier: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:01:00
THE NEXT SPEAKER ON ZOOM IS


[Captioner] 20:01:01
WILLIAM YRAGUI.


[Captioner] 20:01:04
>> GOOD AFTERNOON, GOOD
EVENING.


[Captioner] 20:01:07
THIS IS WILLIAM WITH MISSION


[Captioner] 20:01:07
PEAK CONSERVANCY.


[Captioner] 20:01:13
JUST WANT TO SAY THAT CONCRETE


[Captioner] 20:01:14
BOLLARDS -- CONCRETE ACTUALLY


[Captioner] 20:01:16
WORKS TO PROVIDE A MEDIUM OF


[Captioner] 20:01:17
SAFETY FOR THE BIKERS.


[Captioner] 20:01:19
I'M NOT TOO WORRIED ABOUT THE


[Captioner] 20:01:22
CAR DRIVERS ZOOMING DOWN THE


[Captioner] 20:01:25
STREETS, BUT I'M VERY CONCERNED


[Captioner] 20:01:28
ABOUT BIKE RIDERS MAINTAINING
SAFETY.


[Captioner] 20:01:31
PUBLIC SAFETY IS ENHANCED WHEN


[Captioner] 20:01:32
YOU PUT A LAYER OF CONCRETE


[Captioner] 20:01:37
BETWEEN THE BIKER AND THE


[Captioner] 20:01:38
VEHICLE, SO I WOULD HIGHLY


[Captioner] 20:01:40
RECOMMEND THAT YOU MOVE FORWARD


[Captioner] 20:01:42
WITH THE DECISION BY THE


[Captioner] 20:01:43
MOBILITY COMMISSION TO SUPPORT
THIS.


[Captioner] 20:01:44
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:01:45
>> Ms. Gauthier: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:01:46
THE NEXT SPEAKER IS ANNIE.


[Captioner] 20:01:48
THIS IS IN PERSON.


[Captioner] 20:01:51
NEXT SPEAKER IS ANNIE FOLLOWED


[Captioner] 20:01:52
BY STEVE SCALA.


[Captioner] 20:02:00
>> WE UNFORTUNATELY HAVE QUITE


[Captioner] 20:02:04
RECENTLY HAD A STRING OF CYCLIST


[Captioner] 20:02:05
DEATHS, AND THIS IS INDICATIVE


[Captioner] 20:02:08
OF THE NEED FOR SAFE ROAD


[Captioner] 20:02:09
DESIGN, BECAUSE SAFE ROAD DESIGN


[Captioner] 20:02:10
PREVENTS A LOT OF THESE DEATHS.


[Captioner] 20:02:13
AND SAFE ROAD DESIGN MEANS THAT


[Captioner] 20:02:15
CARS CANNOT GO AS FAST AS THEY


[Captioner] 20:02:17
WANT ALL THE TIME, DOWN THE
ROAD.


[Captioner] 20:02:20
BUT THAT'S WHAT'S NEEDED FOR
SAFETY.


[Captioner] 20:02:22
CARS CANNOT BE ZOOMING 60,


[Captioner] 20:02:24
70 MILES AN HOUR DOWN THE ROAD


[Captioner] 20:02:25
IF WE WANT ALL OF OUR COMMUNITY


[Captioner] 20:02:26
TO BE SAFE.


[Captioner] 20:02:28
AND I UNDERSTAND PEOPLE MIGHT BE


[Captioner] 20:02:31
UNHAPPY ABOUT THIS, BUT IT IS


[Captioner] 20:02:31
NEEDED TO SAVE LIVES.


[Captioner] 20:02:36
AND STRONGER AND STURDIER


[Captioner] 20:02:37
BARRIERS ALONGSIDE SOME OF OUR


[Captioner] 20:02:38
BIKE LANES ARE NEEDED.


[Captioner] 20:02:40
AS IF DRIVERS ARE AFRAID THEY


[Captioner] 20:02:42
ARE GOING TO HIT THE BARRIER,


[Captioner] 20:02:43
THEY IMPLICITLY ADMIT THAT THEY


[Captioner] 20:02:45
ARE DRIVING SO RECKLESSLY THAT


[Captioner] 20:02:46
THEY ARE GOING TO HIT THE


[Captioner] 20:02:47
CONCRETE -- OR THAT THEY'RE


[Captioner] 20:02:49
GOING TO HIT THE BOLLARDS AND


[Captioner] 20:02:51
IMPINGE UPON THE BIKE LANE AND


[Captioner] 20:02:53
HIT THE CYCLISTS BECAUSE THE


[Captioner] 20:02:55
BARRIERS WILL BE WHERE THE


[Captioner] 20:02:55
BOLLARDS ARE NOW.


[Captioner] 20:02:58
IT'S PROOF THAT YOU NEED THE


[Captioner] 20:03:00
BARRIERS TO PROTECT CYCLISTS.


[Captioner] 20:03:01
IRONICALLY ENOUGH.


[Captioner] 20:03:06
AND THIS TYPE OF DRIVING THAT


[Captioner] 20:03:07
WILL POTENTIALLY HIT A BARRIER


[Captioner] 20:03:12
OR HIT A BOLLARD IS SO RECKLESS


[Captioner] 20:03:14
AND WILL CAUSE CYCLISTS' DEATHS,


[Captioner] 20:03:17
AND ALSO IS GOING TO DAMAGE CITY


[Captioner] 20:03:17
PROPERTY.


[Captioner] 20:03:18
IT IS BAD FOR THE WHOLE ENTIRE


[Captioner] 20:03:18
COMMUNITY.


[Captioner] 20:03:22
AND THESE STURDY BARRIERS DO NOT


[Captioner] 20:03:23
MAKE IT HARD TO DRIVE.


[Captioner] 20:03:26
THEY MAKE IT HARD TO SPEED,


[Captioner] 20:03:27
WHICH IS WHAT WE WANT.


[Captioner] 20:03:30
WE WANT TO BE HARD TO SPEED ON


[Captioner] 20:03:32
OUR ROADS BECAUSE SPEEDING IS


[Captioner] 20:03:34
UNSAFE, AND PEOPLE DO NOT HAVE A


[Captioner] 20:03:36
RIGHT TO SPEED DOWN THE ROADS,


[Captioner] 20:03:38
DRIVE RECKLESSLY, AND ENDANGER


[Captioner] 20:03:39
THEMSELVES AND ENDANGER OTHERS.


[Captioner] 20:03:43
THE CITY JUST PRESENTED A


[Captioner] 20:03:45
PROCLAMATION ON ALL THE BENEFITS


[Captioner] 20:03:45
OF BIKING.


[Captioner] 20:03:47
IF WE WANT PEOPLE TO BIKE AND


[Captioner] 20:03:48
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ALL OF THOSE


[Captioner] 20:03:51
BENEFITS, WE NEED MATERIAL


[Captioner] 20:03:53
SYSTEMIC INVESTMENT IN BIKE


[Captioner] 20:03:53
INFRASTRUCTURE.


[Captioner] 20:03:55
AND THESE SAFER BIKE LANES WILL


[Captioner] 20:03:57
LIKELY CAUSE MORE PEOPLE TO


[Captioner] 20:03:58
BIKE, REDUCE -- AND REDUCE
TRAFFIC.


[Captioner] 20:03:59
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:04:00
>> Ms. Gauthier: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:04:00
[APPLAUSE]


[Captioner] 20:04:08
STEVE SCALA FOLLOWED BY VIJAY.


[Captioner] 20:04:08
>> THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:04:12
SO THIS DOES SEEM LIKE DEJA VU
AGAIN.


[Captioner] 20:04:14
EVERY PROJECT WE HAVE, WE HAVE


[Captioner] 20:04:15
THE SAME DISCUSSION, IT SEEMS


[Captioner] 20:04:19
LIKE PEOPLE WHO BIKE OR WALK


[Captioner] 20:04:20
DON'T EXIST.


[Captioner] 20:04:24
MAYOR, COUNCIL, I ASK YOU, GO TO


[Captioner] 20:04:26
THE CORNER OF PASEO PADRE AND


[Captioner] 20:04:28
WALNUT AROUND 5:00 AND COUNT HOW


[Captioner] 20:04:31
MANY PEOPLE ON SCOOTERS,


[Captioner] 20:04:31
SKATEBOARDS, BICYCLISTS,


[Captioner] 20:04:32
PEDESTRIANS ARE QUEUED UP


[Captioner] 20:04:33
WAITING TO CROSS THE
INTERSECTION.


[Captioner] 20:04:37
MAKE YOUR OWN DECISION ABOUT


[Captioner] 20:04:37
THAT, PLEASE.


[Captioner] 20:04:42
WE HEAR CONCRETE BARRIERS.


[Captioner] 20:04:44
IF YOU'RE NOT SURE WHAT THOSE


[Captioner] 20:04:44
ARE, ASK STAFF.


[Captioner] 20:04:45
THEY'LL EXPLAIN.


[Captioner] 20:04:47
THEY'RE ESSENTIALLY CURBS.


[Captioner] 20:04:50
WE COULD PUT IN CURBS BUT WE


[Captioner] 20:04:51
DON'T HAVE BUDGET TO PUT IN REAL


[Captioner] 20:04:51
CURBS.


[Captioner] 20:04:54
SO WE PUT IN THESE TEMPORARY


[Captioner] 20:04:56
CONCRETE BARRIERS TO MAKE IT A


[Captioner] 20:04:57
LITTLE SAFER FOR PEOPLE.


[Captioner] 20:05:00
NOT MUCH DIFFERENT FROM MISSION


[Captioner] 20:05:02
BOULEVARD UP BY HAYWARD, WHERE


[Captioner] 20:05:04
THEY HAD FUNDING TO PUT IN NICE


[Captioner] 20:05:06
PLANTERS BY THE BICYCLE LIGHT
LANES.


[Captioner] 20:05:07
THAT WOULD BE BETTER BUT WE


[Captioner] 20:05:09
DON'T HAVE FUNDING FOR THAT SO


[Captioner] 20:05:10
WE'RE DOING WHAT WE CAN, OUR


[Captioner] 20:05:11
STAFF IS DOING WHAT THEY CAN


[Captioner] 20:05:14
AFTER, AGAIN, CONSIDERABLE


[Captioner] 20:05:16
DISCUSSION WITH MOBILITY


[Captioner] 20:05:16
COMMISSION, AND OTHERS.


[Captioner] 20:05:20
AS FAR AS DRIVERS, IF YOU CAN'T


[Captioner] 20:05:22
DRIVE IN 11 FEET, DON'T DRIVE.


[Captioner] 20:05:23
YOU SHOULDN'T.


[Captioner] 20:05:28
AND NOTHING IS BEING TAKEN AWAY


[Captioner] 20:05:29
FROM DRIVERS.


[Captioner] 20:05:30
THE CAPACITY FOR THE ROADS IS


[Captioner] 20:05:32
STILL THERE, PEOPLE CAN STILL
DRIVE.


[Captioner] 20:05:34
YOU CAN TIME HOW LONG IT TAKES


[Captioner] 20:05:35
TO GET THROUGH THE CORRIDORS.


[Captioner] 20:05:38
IT HASN'T CHANGED.


[Captioner] 20:05:40
IT'S THE SAME AS IT HAS BEEN.


[Captioner] 20:05:42
WE'RE ONLY ALLOWING THE PEOPLE


[Captioner] 20:05:45
WHO CANNOT DRIVE OR DO NOT WANT


[Captioner] 20:05:47
TO DRIVE OR CAN'T AFFORD CARS,


[Captioner] 20:05:49
TO HAVE A WAY TO GET THROUGH THE


[Captioner] 20:05:49
CITY.


[Captioner] 20:05:52
SO LET'S PLEASE CONTINUE WITH


[Captioner] 20:05:54
WHAT STAFF HAS SUGGESTED AND


[Captioner] 20:05:54
MOVE FORWARD.


[Captioner] 20:05:55
THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 20:06:06
VIJAY SOURI FOLLOWED BY DANIEL.


[Captioner] 20:06:06
>> HI.


[Captioner] 20:06:08
A WHOLE BUNCH OF COMMENTS I


[Captioner] 20:06:09
HEARD, YOU KNOW, TODAY.


[Captioner] 20:06:12
FOR PEOPLE THAT BLAME ACCIDENTS


[Captioner] 20:06:17
AND SPEEDING ON BIKERS OR WHAT


[Captioner] 20:06:18
NOT, I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE HOW


[Captioner] 20:06:18
THAT WORKS.


[Captioner] 20:06:23
I AM YET TO READ OF AN INCIDENT


[Captioner] 20:06:24
WHERE SOMEONE IS WALKING TOO


[Captioner] 20:06:26
FAST AND KILLED SOMEBODY, OR


[Captioner] 20:06:27
SOMEONE WAS BIKING TOO FAST AND


[Captioner] 20:06:28
KILLED SOMEBODY.


[Captioner] 20:06:30
TELL ME IF THAT'S HAPPENED,
RIGHT?


[Captioner] 20:06:32
FOR PEOPLE THAT HAVE A PROBLEM


[Captioner] 20:06:33
WITH CONCRETE BARRIERS, THINK


[Captioner] 20:06:35
ABOUT THE NUMBER OF TIMES YOU


[Captioner] 20:06:37
SAID A BOLLARD WAS RUN OVER.


[Captioner] 20:06:39
WHAT IF THAT WAS SOMETHING
WALKING?


[Captioner] 20:06:41
OR WHAT IF SOMEBODY THAT WAS
BIKING?


[Captioner] 20:06:43
WHAT IF THAT WAS YOUR OWN KID,
RIGHT?


[Captioner] 20:06:47
I MEAN, KIDS LEARN TO BIKE


[Captioner] 20:06:48
BEFORE THEY RIDE A CAR.


[Captioner] 20:06:50
DON'T YOU WANT THOSE KIDS TO BE
SAFE?


[Captioner] 20:06:54
AND FOR PEOPLE THAT NEED TO


[Captioner] 20:06:57
COMMUTE TO SAN JOSÉ AND BACK,


[Captioner] 20:06:57
GUESS WHAT?


[Captioner] 20:07:02
I GO TO SAN JOSÉ, L.A.,


[Captioner] 20:07:03
SAN DIEGO, AND I CAN DO ALL OF


[Captioner] 20:07:05
THAT JUST FINE IN A CAR AS LONG


[Captioner] 20:07:06
AS I'M FOLLOWING THE SPEED
LIMIT.


[Captioner] 20:07:09
AND YOU KNOW WHAT, SOMETIMES I


[Captioner] 20:07:10
WANT TO BE THAT DOG THAT'S


[Captioner] 20:07:12
SITTING IN A CAR AND PUTTING THE


[Captioner] 20:07:12
HEAD OUT, RIGHT?


[Captioner] 20:07:14
YOU KNOW HOW I GET TO DO THAT?


[Captioner] 20:07:16
I GET TO DO THAT BY RIDING A


[Captioner] 20:07:17
BIKE, BECAUSE IT'S SO MUCH MORE
FUN.


[Captioner] 20:07:21
WHY DOES SOMEBODY WANT TO TAKE


[Captioner] 20:07:21
AWAY FUN FROM US?


[Captioner] 20:07:22
THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 20:07:35
>> HI.


[Captioner] 20:07:36
THANK YOU, CITY COUNCIL.


[Captioner] 20:07:40
I WANT TO EXPRESS MY SUPPORT FOR


[Captioner] 20:07:42
CONCRETE BARRIERS WHEREVER


[Captioner] 20:07:42
THEY'RE POSSIBLE.


[Captioner] 20:07:45
I JUST WANT TO ADDRESS SOME


[Captioner] 20:07:48
CONCERNS THAT PEOPLE MIGHT HAVE


[Captioner] 20:07:48
WITH THEM.


[Captioner] 20:07:51
IF YOU CAN'T DRIVE WELL ENOUGH


[Captioner] 20:07:53
TO NOT HIT A CONCRETE BARRIER,


[Captioner] 20:07:55
I'M SORRY, YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE A


[Captioner] 20:07:55
DRIVER'S LICENSE.


[Captioner] 20:07:56
IT'S JUST THAT SIMPLE.


[Captioner] 20:08:00
IF THAT IS A PROBLEM FOR YOU,


[Captioner] 20:08:02
LIKE -- THE CONCRETE BARRIERS


[Captioner] 20:08:03
AREN'T IN THE CAR LANE.


[Captioner] 20:08:04
THEY ARE IN THE BUFFER.


[Captioner] 20:08:06
IF LIKE -- IT'S NOT HARD.


[Captioner] 20:08:09
I DRIVE, I RIDE A MOTORCYCLE, I


[Captioner] 20:08:11
RIDE A BIKE, I WALK, I TAKE THE


[Captioner] 20:08:11
TRAIN.


[Captioner] 20:08:13
I AM ABLE TO DO ALL THOSE THINGS


[Captioner] 20:08:13
JUST FINE.


[Captioner] 20:08:16
AND I'VE NEVER HIT A CURB, I'VE


[Captioner] 20:08:19
NEVER HIT, YOU KNOW, A SIGN -- A


[Captioner] 20:08:20
POLE, A TRAFFIC LIGHT.


[Captioner] 20:08:22
ALL THOSE THINGS ARE IN THE


[Captioner] 20:08:24
ROAD, AND YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST
FINE.


[Captioner] 20:08:26
SO IF ANYONE IS CONCERNED ABOUT


[Captioner] 20:08:27
THAT, MAYBE YOU SHOULD CONSIDER,


[Captioner] 20:08:30
YOU KNOW, GIVING UP YOUR


[Captioner] 20:08:30
DRIVER'S LICENSE.


[Captioner] 20:08:32
MAYBE YOU SHOULD RIDE A BIKE IF


[Captioner] 20:08:33
YOU'RE THAT DANGEROUS ON THE


[Captioner] 20:08:34
ROAD, YOU COULD DO A LOT LESS


[Captioner] 20:08:35
DAMAGE ON A BIKE.


[Captioner] 20:08:38
PEOPLE WHO SAY, OH, I DRIVE TO


[Captioner] 20:08:40
SAN JOSÉ AND I CAN'T, YOU


[Captioner] 20:08:41
KNOW -- I CAN'T RIDE A BIKE
THERE.


[Captioner] 20:08:43
NO ONE IS TAKING YOUR CAR AWAY.


[Captioner] 20:08:44
YOU CAN DRIVE YOUR CAR.


[Captioner] 20:08:44
THAT'S FINE.


[Captioner] 20:08:49
BUT DO YOU GO TO SAN JOSÉ TO GO


[Captioner] 20:08:50
TO THE GROCERY STORE?


[Captioner] 20:08:52
DO YOU GO TO SAN JOSÉ TO GO TO


[Captioner] 20:08:53
THE COFFEE SHOP?


[Captioner] 20:08:53
PROBABLY NOT.


[Captioner] 20:08:56
SO MAYBE CONSIDER RIDING A BIKE


[Captioner] 20:08:58
FOR YOUR SHORTER, YOU KNOW,
TRIPS.


[Captioner] 20:09:01
I PERSONALLY -- I WORK IN
SAN JOSÉ.


[Captioner] 20:09:03
I BIKE TO THE TRAIN STATION.


[Captioner] 20:09:06
IT'S FIVE MINUTES AWAY.


[Captioner] 20:09:06
SERIOUSLY.


[Captioner] 20:09:07
LIKE IT'S NOT HARD.


[Captioner] 20:09:10
NO ONE IS TAKING ANYTHING AWAY


[Captioner] 20:09:10
FROM YOU.


[Captioner] 20:09:12
THE CAR LANES ARE STILL GOING TO


[Captioner] 20:09:13
BE THERE.


[Captioner] 20:09:15
NO ONE IS GOING TO TEAR DOWN


[Captioner] 20:09:17
880 AND TURN IT INTO A BIKE
PATH.


[Captioner] 20:09:18
MAYBE IN MY WILDEST DREAMS, BUT


[Captioner] 20:09:19
IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.


[Captioner] 20:09:22
SO LIKE SERIOUSLY, NO ONE IS


[Captioner] 20:09:22
TAKING ANYTHING AWAY FROM YOU.


[Captioner] 20:09:26
IT MAKES IT SAFER FOR CYCLISTS


[Captioner] 20:09:28
AND FOR DRIVERS, BECAUSE, HEY,


[Captioner] 20:09:30
AS A CYCLIST, I'M NO LONGER IN


[Captioner] 20:09:30
YOUR WAY.


[Captioner] 20:09:34
SO YOU CAN DRIVE ON YOUR LANE


[Captioner] 20:09:34
UNIMPEDED.


[Captioner] 20:09:40
HOPEFULLY YOU DON'T SPEED SO WE


[Captioner] 20:09:41
NARROW THOSE CAR LANES.


[Captioner] 20:09:41
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:09:42
>> Ms. Gauthier: THE LAST


[Captioner] 20:09:43
SPEAKER IS ZEE.


[Captioner] 20:09:49
>> HI, THANK YOU FOR HAVING US


[Captioner] 20:09:50
HERE TODAY AND FOR LISTENING TO
US.


[Captioner] 20:09:56
I WAS NOT INTO RIDING BIKES, BUT


[Captioner] 20:09:58
THEN I WAS INSPIRED BY MY


[Captioner] 20:09:59
HUSBAND AND HIS FRIENDS AND THEN


[Captioner] 20:10:01
I SAW THAT IT'S NOT THAT


[Captioner] 20:10:03
DANGEROUS, IT'S NOT THAT SCARY


[Captioner] 20:10:05
BECAUSE THERE ARE THOSE


[Captioner] 20:10:06
BOLLARDS, AND I WAS LIKE OH,


[Captioner] 20:10:08
THIS IS SO COOL, I DIDN'T KNOW


[Captioner] 20:10:08
THIS EXISTED.


[Captioner] 20:10:10
SO I WAS SOMEBODY WHO REALLY


[Captioner] 20:10:13
DIDN'T WANT TO BE ON THE STREET


[Captioner] 20:10:17
RIDING MY BIKES, AND ONCE I


[Captioner] 20:10:19
STARTED, I HAVE ENJOYED IT SO


[Captioner] 20:10:21
MUCH, IT IS SO DIFFERENT FOR


[Captioner] 20:10:23
PEOPLE WHO RIDE, I DO DRIVE MY


[Captioner] 20:10:25
CAR ALSO, RIGHT, SO FOR ME, I


[Captioner] 20:10:26
LOOK AT IT FROM BOTH


[Captioner] 20:10:28
PERSPECTIVES, THAT IF I'M


[Captioner] 20:10:30
DRIVING A CAR, DO I HAVE THE


[Captioner] 20:10:32
VISIBILITY OF A BIKER BECAUSE


[Captioner] 20:10:33
CAR DESIGN IS SUCH THAT THERE


[Captioner] 20:10:35
COULD BE BLIND SPOTS FOR CAR
DRIVERS.


[Captioner] 20:10:38
SO I ALWAYS DRIVE IN A DEFENSIVE


[Captioner] 20:10:40
MODE, I'M RIDING MY CAR OR I AM


[Captioner] 20:10:42
IN A BIKE, I'M ALWAYS THINKING


[Captioner] 20:10:45
ABOUT THE OTHER PERSON, IS THE


[Captioner] 20:10:46
DRIVER ABLE TO SEE ME.


[Captioner] 20:10:47
SO I THINK THAT'S ALL THINGS


[Captioner] 20:10:49
THAT AS YOU'RE RIDING IT MORE


[Captioner] 20:10:51
BIKERS WHO ARE EXPERIENCED, WE


[Captioner] 20:10:52
ARE LEARNING THAT.


[Captioner] 20:10:54
SO I DO HAVE EMPATHY FOR THE CAR


[Captioner] 20:10:56
DRIVERS IF THEY FEEL LIKE, OH, I


[Captioner] 20:10:58
DID NOT SEE THIS BIKE COMING, I


[Captioner] 20:11:00
DO HAVE THAT EMPATHY FOR THEM,


[Captioner] 20:11:01
BUT AT THE SAME TIME, I'M


[Captioner] 20:11:03
WONDERING HOW CAN FREMONT AS A


[Captioner] 20:11:05
CITY CHANGE THE CULTURE TO LET


[Captioner] 20:11:08
THE CAR DRIVERS KNOW THAT, HEY,


[Captioner] 20:11:11
YOU CAN LEAD WITH A LITTLE EMPA


[Captioner] 20:11:12
THESE BECAUSE IT IS ALWAYS


[Captioner] 20:11:14
HELPFUL, AND THEY WHEN I SEE THE


[Captioner] 20:11:15
BOLLARDS WHICH ARE LIKE HIT BY A


[Captioner] 20:11:18
CAR, I DO FEEL LIKE YOU, YOU


[Captioner] 20:11:20
KNOW, IT WAS HIT BY A CAR, THANK


[Captioner] 20:11:21
GOD NOBODY WAS WALKING THERE,


[Captioner] 20:11:22
AND AT THE SAME TIME, I ALSO


[Captioner] 20:11:24
FEEL LIKE CAR DID NOT GET A BIG


[Captioner] 20:11:25
BUMP WITH THAT BECAUSE IT'S
PLASTIC.


[Captioner] 20:11:27
THIS CAR DENTED BUT CAR IS
OKAY.


[Captioner] 20:11:29
SO I'M ALWAYS LOOKING AT BOTH


[Captioner] 20:11:31
THE SIDES OF THE THING, AND


[Captioner] 20:11:32
THINKING THAT THIS IS GOOD WE


[Captioner] 20:11:34
HAVE IT THIS WAY SO WHETHER WE


[Captioner] 20:11:36
ARE GOING WITH CONCRETE, WHETHER


[Captioner] 20:11:37
WE ARE GOING -- AT THE END OF


[Captioner] 20:11:39
THE DAY, IT'S ABOUT SAFETY OF


[Captioner] 20:11:40
EVERYBODY WHO LIVES IN FREMONT.


[Captioner] 20:11:47
I HAVE ENCOURAGED MY FRIENDS


[Captioner] 20:11:50
AND THEIR KIDS TO RIDE WITH ME


[Captioner] 20:11:51
BECAUSE THEY SEE I'M HAVING FUN


[Captioner] 20:11:52
AND I'M SAFE.


[Captioner] 20:11:53
SO WITH THAT, THANK YOU SO
MUCH.


[Captioner] 20:11:55
>> Ms. Gauthier: MAYOR, WE'VE


[Captioner] 20:11:57
HAD EDWARD CHEN HAS RAISED HIS


[Captioner] 20:11:59
HAND TO SPEAK TO THIS ITEM IN
ZOOM.


[Captioner] 20:12:02
THAT WILL BE THE LAST SPEAKER.


[Captioner] 20:12:07
>> HI.


[Captioner] 20:12:10
I FORGOT TO TELL YOU I LIVE ON


[Captioner] 20:12:12
VALDEZ WAY AND JUST HAD MY IDEAS


[Captioner] 20:12:14
ABOUT THE NEW BRIDGE IN THE GOLF


[Captioner] 20:12:16
COURSE AREA.


[Captioner] 20:12:20
HERE'S WHAT SHARON DAVIS SAID.


[Captioner] 20:12:23
DEAR CITY OF FREMONT CITY


[Captioner] 20:12:24
COUNCIL --


[Captioner] 20:12:26
>> Mayor Mei: JUST TO CLARIFY,


[Captioner] 20:12:31
THIS IS ON THE ITEM REGARDING


[Captioner] 20:12:33
THE ADOPTING A RESOLUTION FOR


[Captioner] 20:12:35
BIKE WAY ENHANCE M.


[Captioner] 20:12:36
IS YOUR COMMENTS PERTAINING TO


[Captioner] 20:12:38
THE BIKE WAY ENHANCEMENT
PROJECT?


[Captioner] 20:12:39
>> MM-HMM.


[Captioner] 20:12:43
I ALREADY SAID SOMETHING ABOUT


[Captioner] 20:12:45
THE CITY OF FREMONT PUTTING


[Captioner] 20:12:50
BRIDGE IN THE GOLF COURSE AREA


[Captioner] 20:12:52
TO LINK TO THE LAS PALMAS AREA.


[Captioner] 20:12:53
HERE'S WHAT SHARON DAVIS SAID.


[Captioner] 20:12:57
A PATH SEGMENT CONNECTING THE


[Captioner] 20:13:00
EXISTING BICYCLE PEDESTRIAN PATH


[Captioner] 20:13:01
FROM CENTRAL PARK ACROSS THE


[Captioner] 20:13:05
GOLF COURSE AREA TO THE OLD


[Captioner] 20:13:08
UNUSED UNION PACIFIC RAILROAD,


[Captioner] 20:13:10
OPEN ACCESS TO MISSION BLFL AND


[Captioner] 20:13:10
MANY FREMONT NEIGHBORHOODS.


[Captioner] 20:13:13
A SMALL PEDESTRIAN BRIDGE ACROSS


[Captioner] 20:13:15
THE DRAINAGE CHANNEL AT THE GOLF


[Captioner] 20:13:17
COURSE AREA --


[Captioner] 20:13:18
>> Mayor Mei: SIR, I'M TRYING


[Captioner] 20:13:20
TO UNDERSTAND HOW THAT


[Captioner] 20:13:21
PERTAINS -- THE BIKEWAY


[Captioner] 20:13:22
IMPROVEMENTS THAT WE'RE TALKING


[Captioner] 20:13:24
ABOUT ARE ACTUALLY ALONG THE


[Captioner] 20:13:26
COMPLETE STREETS WHICH ARE PASEO


[Captioner] 20:13:27
PADRE ITSELF.


[Captioner] 20:13:30
>> ACTUALLY A SMALL PEDESTRIAN


[Captioner] 20:13:31
BRIDGE ACROSS A DRAINAGE CHANNEL


[Captioner] 20:13:33
AT THE EDGE OF THE GOLF COURSE


[Captioner] 20:13:36
AREA WOULD ENABLE PEDESTRIANS


[Captioner] 20:13:38
WALKING FROM CENTRAL PARK ACROSS


[Captioner] 20:13:41
THE GOLF COURSE TO ACCESS THE


[Captioner] 20:13:41
RAIL BED.


[Captioner] 20:13:42
THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.


[Captioner] 20:13:44
>> Mayor Mei: BUT THAT


[Captioner] 20:13:45
WOULDN'T PERTAIN TO THIS ITEM,
SIR.


[Captioner] 20:13:48
>> OKAY, BUT YOU HEARD ME TALK


[Captioner] 20:13:49
ABOUT --


[Captioner] 20:13:50
>> Mayor Mei: WE HEARD YOUR


[Captioner] 20:13:51
THOUGHTS EARLIER BUT THAT'S NOT


[Captioner] 20:13:54
FOR THIS ITEM AND FOR PUBLIC


[Captioner] 20:13:55
COMMENTS IF ITEMS ARE NOT


[Captioner] 20:13:57
AGENDIZED YOU CAN MAKE YOUR


[Captioner] 20:13:59
COMMENT BUT WE DO NOT ADDRESS


[Captioner] 20:14:00
THOSE ITEMS AT THE COUNCIL


[Captioner] 20:14:01
MEETING BECAUSE IT'S NOT
AGENDIZED.


[Captioner] 20:14:06
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:14:08
SO AT THIS TIME, I WILL RETURN


[Captioner] 20:14:11
IT BACK TO THE COUNCIL FOR


[Captioner] 20:14:14
COMMENTS ON THIS ITEM, OR A


[Captioner] 20:14:15
MOTION.


[Captioner] 20:14:21
THIS IS, AGAIN, 2M AS IN MOVE.


[Captioner] 20:14:27
COUNCILMEMBER SHAO, I SEE YOUR


[Captioner] 20:14:27
BUTTON.


[Captioner] 20:14:28
>> Councilmember Shao: THANK


[Captioner] 20:14:28
YOU, MAYOR.


[Captioner] 20:14:29
I HAVE JUST A SIMPLE QUESTION.


[Captioner] 20:14:32
HOW TALL WILL THOSE CONCRETE


[Captioner] 20:14:33
BARRIERS BE?


[Captioner] 20:14:36
ARE THEY GOING TO BE AS TALL AS


[Captioner] 20:14:37
THE EXISTING GREEN BOLLARD?


[Captioner] 20:14:54
>> Mr. Larsen: GOOD AFTERNOON,


[Captioner] 20:14:55
MAYOR, MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL.


[Captioner] 20:14:57
COUNCILMEMBER SHAO, SO THANKS


[Captioner] 20:14:57
FOR THE QUESTION.


[Captioner] 20:15:00
YES, I THINK THERE'S A LITTLE


[Captioner] 20:15:01
BIT OF MISUNDERSTANDING OF WHAT


[Captioner] 20:15:02
WE'RE PLACING IN THERE.


[Captioner] 20:15:06
SO THE CONCRETE ITEMS THAT ARE


[Captioner] 20:15:08
GOING THERE ARE SIX-INCH CURBS,


[Captioner] 20:15:10
SO THEY'RE MODULAR CURBS, AND


[Captioner] 20:15:14
THEY WOULD REPLACE EVERY OTHER


[Captioner] 20:15:15
ONE OF THE GREEN BOLLARDS.


[Captioner] 20:15:17
SO THE INTENT IS TO PROVIDE SOME


[Captioner] 20:15:18
GREATER PHYSICAL PROTECTION OF


[Captioner] 20:15:23
THE BIKE LANE, BUT WE'RE


[Captioner] 20:15:26
RETAINING THE PLASTIC BOLLARDS


[Captioner] 20:15:27
WITHIN THE CORRIDOR, BUT AT A


[Captioner] 20:15:28
LESSER SPACING SO THAT YOU STILL


[Captioner] 20:15:31
HAVE KIND OF THE VISUAL


[Captioner] 20:15:32
SEPARATION WITHIN THE CORRIDOR.


[Captioner] 20:15:36
SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE


[Captioner] 20:15:37
ILLUSTRATED WHEN WE DISCUSSED


[Captioner] 20:15:39
THIS WITH THE MOBILITY


[Captioner] 20:15:40
COMMISSION AS AN IMPROVEMENT TO


[Captioner] 20:15:41
THE LEVEL OF PROTECTION.


[Captioner] 20:15:43
PART OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO


[Captioner] 20:15:45
ACCOMPLISH IS, YOU KNOW, WE DO


[Captioner] 20:15:46
FEEL THERE'S A BIT OF VANDALISM


[Captioner] 20:15:49
OF THE BOLLARDS, THEY JUST GET


[Captioner] 20:15:49
KNOWED DOWN.


[Captioner] 20:15:51
THAT'S REALLY THE ESTHETIC ISSUE


[Captioner] 20:15:53
WE'RE CONCERNED WITH, IS DAMAGED


[Captioner] 20:15:54
BOLLARDS, AND SO HAVING SOME


[Captioner] 20:15:56
ADDED PROTECTION THERE WITH


[Captioner] 20:15:57
THE -- IT'S LIKE A CURB STOP,


[Captioner] 20:15:59
YOU KNOW, THAT YOU WOULD SEE IN


[Captioner] 20:15:59
A PARKING LOT.


[Captioner] 20:16:09
WE DO HAVE SOME PHOTOS, IF THE


[Captioner] 20:16:10
COUNCIL WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT,


[Captioner] 20:16:12
MAYBE IT WOULD BENEFIT THE


[Captioner] 20:16:12
PUBLIC.


[Captioner] 20:16:13
>> Mayor Mei: YES, PLEASE.


[Captioner] 20:16:15
>> Councilmember Campbell:


[Captioner] 20:16:15
YES, PLEASE.


[Captioner] 20:16:21
>> Mr. Larsen: SO UP ON THE


[Captioner] 20:16:23
SLIDE HERE IS A VISUAL OF KIND


[Captioner] 20:16:26
OF THE TYPICAL INSTALLATION OF


[Captioner] 20:16:30
OUR SEPARATED BIKEWAY, SO WE


[Captioner] 20:16:32
HAVE A PAINTED BUFFER AREA.


[Captioner] 20:16:33
THERE HAS BEEN AN EVOLUTION WHEN


[Captioner] 20:16:35
WE STARTED THESE, WE WERE


[Captioner] 20:16:36
PUTTING IN SORT OF THE THIN


[Captioner] 20:16:37
WHITE POSTS.


[Captioner] 20:16:39
THERE WAS A CONCERN WITH JUST


[Captioner] 20:16:42
THE LOOKS OF THAT, AND WHEN THEY


[Captioner] 20:16:45
GET HIT, THEY LOOK -- THEY LOOK


[Captioner] 20:16:48
SCUFFED UP AND SO BASED ON


[Captioner] 20:16:50
INPUT, YOU KNOW, WE WENT TO THE


[Captioner] 20:16:53
GREEN BOLLARDS.


[Captioner] 20:16:55
THE MAP ON THE RIGHT IS THE


[Captioner] 20:16:56
LOCATION WHERE THESE ARE, SO


[Captioner] 20:16:58
THESE ARE NOT ANY NEW


[Captioner] 20:17:01
INSTALLATIONS BUT BASICALLY


[Captioner] 20:17:02
REPLACING BOLLARDS AND SEPARATED


[Captioner] 20:17:04
DEVICES WHERE THEY HAVE BEEN


[Captioner] 20:17:06
DAMAGED, AND SO THERE'S A NEED


[Captioner] 20:17:09
TO REPLACE THEM, AND THEN


[Captioner] 20:17:10
STRATEGICALLY WE'RE SELECTING


[Captioner] 20:17:12
LOCATIONS NEAR SCHOOLS, WHERE


[Captioner] 20:17:15
WE'RE TRYING TO ENCOURAGE MORE


[Captioner] 20:17:18
KIDS TO WALK AND BICYCLE TO
SCHOOL.


[Captioner] 20:17:21
THE NEXT SLIDE KIND OF INDICATES


[Captioner] 20:17:22
WHAT THESE WOULD LOOK LIKE.


[Captioner] 20:17:26
SO THE EXAMPLE ON THE LEFT IS


[Captioner] 20:17:27
FREMONT BOULEVARD IN FRONT OF


[Captioner] 20:17:29
AMERICAN HIGH SCHOOL, SO YOU CAN


[Captioner] 20:17:32
SEE THE COMBINATION, IN THIS


[Captioner] 20:17:33
CASE THIS IS SOMETHING WE TRIED


[Captioner] 20:17:36
OUT WITH A PLASTIC CURB WITH A


[Captioner] 20:17:38
WHITE POST ON IT, ALTERNATING


[Captioner] 20:17:40
WITH THE GREEN BOLLARDS.


[Captioner] 20:17:45
WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING WITH THIS


[Captioner] 20:17:46
EFFORT, AND IT'S REALLY KIND OF


[Captioner] 20:17:49
THE CONTINUATION OF


[Captioner] 20:17:49
EXPERIMENTING DIFFERENT


[Captioner] 20:17:51
TREATMENTS, IS TO ACTUALLY HAVE


[Captioner] 20:17:53
A CONCRETE CURB WHERE THE WHITE


[Captioner] 20:17:54
IS, THEN ALTERNATING WITH THE


[Captioner] 20:17:55
GREEN BOLLARD.


[Captioner] 20:17:57
THE PHOTO ON THE RIGHT IS AN


[Captioner] 20:17:58
EXAMPLE OF THE TYPES OF CURBS WE


[Captioner] 20:18:00
WOULD PLACE THAT -- THIS IS AN


[Captioner] 20:18:02
EXAMPLE IN CUPERTINO, WHERE THEY


[Captioner] 20:18:04
PLACED THEM CONTINUOUSLY ALONG


[Captioner] 20:18:05
THE CORRIDOR.


[Captioner] 20:18:08
IT'S A BIT MORE EXPENSIVE, BUT


[Captioner] 20:18:10
OUR VIEW IS IT DOESN'T HAVE THE


[Captioner] 20:18:13
BENEFIT OF THE VISUAL HEIGHT,


[Captioner] 20:18:16
WHICH CREATES SORT OF A MORE


[Captioner] 20:18:17
VISUAL SEPARATION INTO THE
AREA.


[Captioner] 20:18:20
WHAT WE'RE DOING IS VERY


[Captioner] 20:18:23
CONSISTENT WITH CURRENT GUIDANCE


[Captioner] 20:18:25
THAT WAS MENTIONED FROM NACTO,


[Captioner] 20:18:27
AS WELL AS STATE AND FEDERAL


[Captioner] 20:18:29
GOVERNMENT, ON WHEN YOU DO HAVE


[Captioner] 20:18:32
PHYSICALLY SEPARATED BIKEWAYS,


[Captioner] 20:18:34
REALLY ISN'T ENOUGH TO JUST HAVE


[Captioner] 20:18:35
PLASTIC IN THERE, BUT HAVING


[Captioner] 20:18:37
SOMETHING THAT IS BOTH MORE


[Captioner] 20:18:38
DURABLE AND PROVIDES AN ADDED


[Captioner] 20:18:41
LEVEL OF PROTECTION AN SO


[Captioner] 20:18:43
CONCRETE IS THE RECOMMENDED


[Captioner] 20:18:44
DIRECTION TO GO IN.


[Captioner] 20:18:47
>> Councilmember Shao: THANK
YOU.


[Captioner] 20:18:51
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:18:53
NEXT IS COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL.


[Captioner] 20:18:55
>> Councilmember Campbell: I


[Captioner] 20:18:56
WAS ACTUALLY GOING TO ASK IF


[Captioner] 20:18:58
THERE WAS A PICTURE, BUT I'D


[Captioner] 20:18:59
LIKE TO MOVE TO APPROVE,
PLEASE.


[Captioner] 20:19:01
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY.


[Captioner] 20:19:04
I SEE A MOTION.


[Captioner] 20:19:06
>> Councilmember Kassan:
SECOND.


[Captioner] 20:19:07
>> Mayor Mei: COUNCILMEMBER


[Captioner] 20:19:10
KASSAN, IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE --


[Captioner] 20:19:11
>> Councilmember Kassan: YES.


[Captioner] 20:19:12
>> Mayor Mei: WE HAVE A MOTION


[Captioner] 20:19:13
AND SECOND AND ALSO WE HAVE


[Captioner] 20:19:14
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN, SO WE'VE


[Captioner] 20:19:15
HAD A MOTION AND SECOND.


[Captioner] 20:19:19
DID YOU -- OH, YOU HAD A
QUESTION?


[Captioner] 20:19:20
OKAY.


[Captioner] 20:19:23
YOU HAD A QUESTION?


[Captioner] 20:19:25
>> Councilmember Salwan: OKAY,


[Captioner] 20:19:25
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:19:30
I'M GLAD YOU SHOWED THE PHOTOS


[Captioner] 20:19:33
BECAUSE I GOOGLED IT AND IT


[Captioner] 20:19:35
LOOKED TERRIBLE, PRECAST
CONCRETE.


[Captioner] 20:19:37
SO THIS IS DEFINITELY MUCH MORE


[Captioner] 20:19:37
REASSURING.


[Captioner] 20:19:41
SO IS THERE LIKE ANY ONGOING


[Captioner] 20:19:42
MAINTENANCE THAT WE HAVE TO DO


[Captioner] 20:19:45
WITH THESE CONCRETE -- WHATEVER


[Captioner] 20:19:47
YOU CALL THEM, SEPARATIONS?


[Captioner] 20:19:48
?


[Captioner] 20:19:50
>> Mr. Larsen: I MEAN, THAT'S


[Captioner] 20:19:51
KIND OF A KEY INTEREST.


[Captioner] 20:19:53
WE'RE FINDING WE'RE HAVING TO


[Captioner] 20:19:55
REPLACE DAMAGED PLASTIC BOLLARDS


[Captioner] 20:19:57
SORT OF MORE FREQUENTLY THAN WE


[Captioner] 20:20:01
EXPECTED, AND SO GOING WITH A


[Captioner] 20:20:03
CONCRETE DEVICE, THERE'S -- IT'S


[Captioner] 20:20:05
A BIT HIGHER IN TERMS OF THE


[Captioner] 20:20:06
INITIAL INSTALLATION, BUT


[Captioner] 20:20:08
CERTAINLY THAT LOW CURB IS NOT


[Captioner] 20:20:10
SOMETHING THAT IS GOING TO BE


[Captioner] 20:20:13
DAMAGED IF A VEHICLE HITS IT,


[Captioner] 20:20:15
AND SO IN THE LONG TERM, WE


[Captioner] 20:20:16
THINK, YOU KNOW, THIS IS GOING


[Captioner] 20:20:18
TO MINIMIZE THE AMOUNT OF


[Captioner] 20:20:20
MAINTENANCE THAT WE HAVE TO DO,


[Captioner] 20:20:22
AND THEN ALSO KIND OF IMPROVE


[Captioner] 20:20:24
THE ESTHETICS OF THE CORRIDOR BY


[Captioner] 20:20:26
NOT HAVING SO MANY DAMAGED


[Captioner] 20:20:28
BOLLARDS IN THE AREA.


[Captioner] 20:20:29
>> Councilmember Salwan: SO IF


[Captioner] 20:20:31
LIKE A CAR RUNS OVER IT OR A


[Captioner] 20:20:33
BIKE HITS IT, IT WON'T HAVE ANY


[Captioner] 20:20:33
DAMAGE OR ANY --


[Captioner] 20:20:34
>> Mr. Larsen: WELL, I THINK


[Captioner] 20:20:35
IT'S PROBABLY NOT -- I MEAN, SO


[Captioner] 20:20:37
THERE ARE KIND OF OPENINGS IN


[Captioner] 20:20:38
TERMS OF THE WAY THAT WE'RE


[Captioner] 20:20:40
LOOKING AT IT, SO CERTAINLY IT


[Captioner] 20:20:44
ALLOWS DRAINAGE TO FLOW OR, YOU


[Captioner] 20:20:45
KNOW, SOMETIMES THERE'S A NEED


[Captioner] 20:20:48
TO GET TO THE CURB, YOU KNOW,


[Captioner] 20:20:51
FOR EMERGENCY RESPONSE


[Captioner] 20:20:52
PURPOSES SO THEY'RE LOW, SO THEY


[Captioner] 20:20:55
CAN EASILY BE CLEARED BY AN


[Captioner] 20:20:57
EMERGENCY VEHICLE, BUT I THINK


[Captioner] 20:20:59
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS --


[Captioner] 20:21:00
YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE A DISTRACTED


[Captioner] 20:21:03
DRIVER THAT'S MAYBE NOT PAYING


[Captioner] 20:21:04
ATTENTION, THE THOUGHT WAS THAT


[Captioner] 20:21:07
IT HIT THE PLASTIC BOLLARD, THAT


[Captioner] 20:21:08
WILL ALETTERED THEM TO CORRECT.


[Captioner] 20:21:12
THIS PROVIDES KIND OF A STRONGER


[Captioner] 20:21:14
PHYSICAL CORRECTION FOR SOMEBODY


[Captioner] 20:21:15
WHO'S NOT STAYING IN THEIR
LANE.


[Captioner] 20:21:16
>> Councilmember Salwan: THEN


[Captioner] 20:21:18
ROBERT MENTIONED ABOUT THE


[Captioner] 20:21:18
RUMBLE STRIPS.


[Captioner] 20:21:20
IS THAT HELPFUL AS WELL OR


[Captioner] 20:21:22
WHAT'S THE THOUGHT ON THAT?


[Captioner] 20:21:25



[Captioner] 20:21:26
>> Mr. Larsen: RUMBLE STRIPS


[Captioner] 20:21:29
ARE VERY EFFECTIVE ON SORT OF


[Captioner] 20:21:30
MORE A HIGHWAY ENVIRONMENT OR


[Captioner] 20:21:32
KIND OF A RURAL ROAD NIGHTTIME


[Captioner] 20:21:33
DRIVING OR SO, YOU CROSS INTO


[Captioner] 20:21:35
THE CENTER LANE, YOU PROBABLY


[Captioner] 20:21:38
FELT IT OR ON THE SIDE, YOU FEEL


[Captioner] 20:21:40
THAT YOU'RE OUT OF THE LANE AND


[Captioner] 20:21:41
THAT ALLOWS YOU TO CORRECT.


[Captioner] 20:21:43
BUT THEY DON'T HAVE ANY --


[Captioner] 20:21:45
THERE'S NO VISUAL ELEMENT TO
IT.


[Captioner] 20:21:47
AND SO YOU DON'T SORT OF HAVE,


[Captioner] 20:21:49
YOU KNOW, WHAT WE'RE STRIVING


[Captioner] 20:21:52
FOR HERE IS SOME LEVEL OF


[Captioner] 20:21:55
VISIBLE PROTECTION, WHICH HELPS


[Captioner] 20:21:56
SORT OF GUIDE PEOPLE IN THE


[Captioner] 20:21:59
PROPER SPACE WHEREAS THE RUMBLE


[Captioner] 20:22:00
STRIPS, YOU KNOW, ARE REALLY


[Captioner] 20:22:02
FLAT WITH THE SURFACE AND WHILE


[Captioner] 20:22:04
IT'S EFFECTIVE IN SOME CASES, WE


[Captioner] 20:22:06
WOULDN'T SEE IT AS MEETING OUR


[Captioner] 20:22:07
NEEDS IN THIS TYPE OF
APPLICATION.


[Captioner] 20:22:09
>> Councilmember Salwan: THANK
YOU.


[Captioner] 20:22:11
THEN LAST QUESTION, YOU SHOWED


[Captioner] 20:22:13
TWO EXAMPLES.


[Captioner] 20:22:15
ONE WAS CUPERTINO AND ONE WAS


[Captioner] 20:22:16
ACROSS FROM AMERICAN HIGH
SCHOOL.


[Captioner] 20:22:18
SO ARE WE GOING TO DO IT LIKE


[Captioner] 20:22:21
 CUPERTINO OR WHAT'S THE


[Captioner] 20:22:22
THINKING THERE?


[Captioner] 20:22:24
>> Mr. Larsen: SO THAT


[Captioner] 20:22:25
CONTINUOUS CONCRETE CUSHING IS


[Captioner] 20:22:26
QUITE A BIT MORE EXPENSIVE.


[Captioner] 20:22:30
SO I THINK WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO


[Captioner] 20:22:33
SEE IF WE GET SORT OF THE


[Captioner] 20:22:35
SAFETY, THE PROTECTION, SORT OF


[Captioner] 20:22:37
THE SENSE OF COMFORT OF


[Captioner] 20:22:39
PROTECTION WITH A LOWER SORT OF


[Captioner] 20:22:39
LEVEL OF IMPROVEMENT.


[Captioner] 20:22:45
THE WAY IT'S DESIGNED, WE COULD


[Captioner] 20:22:45
EVOLVE INTO KIND OF FILLING IN


[Captioner] 20:22:48
THE GAPS IF WE FIND THAT THE


[Captioner] 20:22:50
CONTINUOUS CURB IS A BETTER


[Captioner] 20:22:52
TREATMENT OVERALL.


[Captioner] 20:22:55
I MIGHT ADD AS THE COUNCIL IS


[Captioner] 20:22:56
AWARE, WE ARE GOING TO BE


[Captioner] 20:22:59
ROLLING OUT THIS SUMMER AND FALL


[Captioner] 20:23:01
WITH A NEW FIVE-YEAR ACTIVE


[Captioner] 20:23:03
TRANSPORTATION PLAN, SO AN


[Captioner] 20:23:05
UPDATE TO OUR BICYCLE AND


[Captioner] 20:23:09
PEDESTRIAN PLANS, AND WE REALLY


[Captioner] 20:23:11
WANT TO HEAR FROM THE COMMUNITY,


[Captioner] 20:23:13
WHAT IT IS, HOW WE CAN SORT OF


[Captioner] 20:23:16
BEST FIT IN GOOD, SAFE


[Captioner] 20:23:18
INFRASTRUCTURE TO ENCOURAGE MORE


[Captioner] 20:23:18
WALKING AND BIKING.


[Captioner] 20:23:21
BUT WE DO WANT TO ALSO PAY


[Captioner] 20:23:23
ATTENTION TO KIND OF THE


[Captioner] 20:23:25
ESTHETICS OF THE STREETSCAPE,


[Captioner] 20:23:29
THE MAINTENANCE.


[Captioner] 20:23:31
SO THE THINK THE DISCUSSION HERE


[Captioner] 20:23:32
TODAY ON THIS ITEM IS REALLY


[Captioner] 20:23:33
GOOD TO HEAR, THE KINDS OF


[Captioner] 20:23:35
CONCERNS THAT ARE OUT THERE, AND


[Captioner] 20:23:36
THEN WE'LL HAVE A FORMAL PROCESS


[Captioner] 20:23:40
FOR PEOPLE TO GIVE US THIS KIND


[Captioner] 20:23:43
OF INPUT, MORE INPUT, AND THEN


[Captioner] 20:23:45
THAT WILL GO INTO A NEW ACTIVE


[Captioner] 20:23:46
TRANSPORTATION PLAN THAT WILL


[Captioner] 20:23:49
COME TO COUNCIL HOPEFULLY A


[Captioner] 20:23:50
LITTLE LESS THAN A YEAR FROM
NOW.


[Captioner] 20:23:53
>> Councilmember Salwan: TWO


[Captioner] 20:23:53
FINAL THINGS.


[Captioner] 20:23:55
ONE WAS ABOUT PUBLIC SAFETY,


[Captioner] 20:23:56
SOME OF THE POLICE OFFICERS WERE


[Captioner] 20:24:00
SAYING THAT THEY CUT ACROSS THE


[Captioner] 20:24:01
BOLLARDS IN AN EMERGENCY BASIS.


[Captioner] 20:24:03
WOULD THEY STILL BE ABLE TO DO


[Captioner] 20:24:05
THAT HERE OR HOW DOES THAT
WORK?


[Captioner] 20:24:06
>> YES, THEY'LL STILL BE ABLE TO


[Captioner] 20:24:06
DO THAT.


[Captioner] 20:24:08
SO THEY'RE DESIGNED TO


[Captioner] 20:24:09
ACCOMMODATE PUBLIC SAFETY.


[Captioner] 20:24:10
>> Councilmember Salwan:
OKAY.


[Captioner] 20:24:13
AND THEN VISUALLY, IT SEEMS LIKE


[Captioner] 20:24:14
WHEN THEY'RE UPRIGHT, YOU CAN


[Captioner] 20:24:15
SEE THEM FROM FURTHER AWAY.


[Captioner] 20:24:17
IS THERE SOME TRADEOFFS AS FAR


[Captioner] 20:24:20
AS HAVING CONCRETE THAT'S LOWER


[Captioner] 20:24:21
VERSUS SOMETHING HIGHER THAT YOU


[Captioner] 20:24:24
CAN SEE FROM FURTHER AWAY?


[Captioner] 20:24:25
>> Mr. Larsen: THAT'S KIND OF


[Captioner] 20:24:27
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET, IS THE


[Captioner] 20:24:29
BEST OF BOTH WORLDS WITH SORT


[Captioner] 20:24:31
OF -- YOU CAN SORT OF CALL IT A


[Captioner] 20:24:31
HYBRID DESIGN.


[Captioner] 20:24:33
SO WHAT WE'RE DOING IS KIND OF


[Captioner] 20:24:35
IN BETWEEN WHAT WE HAVE NOW AND


[Captioner] 20:24:38
THEN WHAT CUPERTINO HAS, AND SO


[Captioner] 20:24:39
YOU GET BOTH --


[Captioner] 20:24:40
>> Councilmember Salwan:
HYBRID.


[Captioner] 20:24:41
>> Mr. Larsen: YOU CAN SEE THE


[Captioner] 20:24:43
CORRIDOR WITH THE REFLECTED


[Captioner] 20:24:45
PLASTIC BOLLARDS, BUT THEN YOU


[Captioner] 20:24:47
HAVE MORE PHYSICAL PROTECTION


[Captioner] 20:24:50
WITH THE LOWER OR CONCRETE
CURBS.


[Captioner] 20:24:51
>> Councilmember Salwan: WHILE


[Captioner] 20:24:52
WE'RE TALKING, THERE'S ALSO THE


[Captioner] 20:24:54
ISSUE THAT COMES ABOUT CLEANING


[Captioner] 20:24:54
THE BIKE LANES.


[Captioner] 20:24:56
SOMEBODY MENTIONED THAT THE


[Captioner] 20:25:01
STREET SWEEPER CAN'T GET THERE


[Captioner] 20:25:02
OR -- IS THAT TRUE OR HOW DO WE


[Captioner] 20:25:03
ADDRESS THAT?


[Captioner] 20:25:05
>> Mr. Larsen: OUR BIKE LANES


[Captioner] 20:25:06
JUST AS OUR STREETS ARE CLEANED


[Captioner] 20:25:07
ON A MONTHLY BASIS.


[Captioner] 20:25:09
SO THAT'S A SERVICE THAT'S


[Captioner] 20:25:11
PROVIDED THROUGHOUT THE CITY OF


[Captioner] 20:25:11
FREMONT.


[Captioner] 20:25:14
THE COMMENT THAT WAS RAISED IS


[Captioner] 20:25:17
THAT YOU MAY HAVE A WINDSTORM OR


[Captioner] 20:25:18
SOMETHING, OR THERE'S DEBRIS


[Captioner] 20:25:20
THAT GETS INTO THE BIKE LANE,


[Captioner] 20:25:24
AND IT MAY GO -- IT MAY HAPPEN


[Captioner] 20:25:26
TWO DAYS AFTER IT WAS SWEPT,


[Captioner] 20:25:28
THEN IT'S SITTING THERE FOR, YOU


[Captioner] 20:25:29
KNOW, FOUR WEEKS OR SOMETHING


[Captioner] 20:25:31
LIKE THAT.


[Captioner] 20:25:35
SO I THINK FOR FOLKS THAT ARE


[Captioner] 20:25:37
RIDE AGO BIKE MORE SENSITIVE


[Captioner] 20:25:38
TO DEGREE AND THINGS WITH THE


[Captioner] 20:25:40
BIKE LANE, SO WE'VE HEARD THE


[Captioner] 20:25:41
INTEREST OF MORE FREQUENT
CLEANING.


[Captioner] 20:25:43
WHAT WE ARE DOING TO RESPOND TO


[Captioner] 20:25:46
THAT IS THAT WE DO HAVE A


[Captioner] 20:25:51
CONTRACT TO DO SUPPLEMENTAL


[Captioner] 20:25:56
 BIKE


[Captioner] 20:25:58
LANE CLEANINGS ON A NEEDED
BASIS.


[Captioner] 20:26:01
WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO GO IN AND


[Captioner] 20:26:04
REMOVE THE DEBRIS THAT GETS IN


[Captioner] 20:26:05
THERE BETWEEN THE REGULAR


[Captioner] 20:26:05
MONTHLY CLEANINGS.


[Captioner] 20:26:08
WE ALSO KNOW YOU HAVE LEAF


[Captioner] 20:26:10
DEBRIS AND THERE'S TIMES OF THE


[Captioner] 20:26:14
YEAR WHERE THEY GET DIRTIER, SO


[Captioner] 20:26:15
WE'RE AWARE OF THAT AND WE'LL


[Captioner] 20:26:18
HAVE OUR CONTRACTOR DO


[Captioner] 20:26:19
SUPPLEMENTAL CLEANINGS DURING


[Captioner] 20:26:21
THAT TIME IN ORDER TO PROVIDE A


[Captioner] 20:26:21
HIGHER LEVEL OF CLEANING.


[Captioner] 20:26:26
SO I THINK WE'LL LEARN FROM THE


[Captioner] 20:26:28
COMMUNITY IF WHAT WE'RE DOING IS


[Captioner] 20:26:28
SATISFACTORY.


[Captioner] 20:26:30
IT MAY BE THAT FOLKS DON'T


[Captioner] 20:26:32
REALIZE WE HAVE THIS ON-CALL


[Captioner] 20:26:34
SERVICE AS NEEDED, AND GO ON


[Captioner] 20:26:36
YOUR PHONE AND HIT THE FREMONT


[Captioner] 20:26:38
APP AND SAY THERE'S DEBRIS IN


[Captioner] 20:26:39
THE BIKE LANE AND WE'LL TAKE


[Captioner] 20:26:40
CARE OF IT.


[Captioner] 20:26:41
>> Councilmember Salwan:
GREAT.


[Captioner] 20:26:42
THANK YOU, MR. LARSEN.


[Captioner] 20:26:44
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:26:46
COUNCILMEMBER SHAO, I WILL


[Captioner] 20:26:47
MENTION THAT WE HAVE A MOTION


[Captioner] 20:26:48
AND A SECOND AND ALSO WE'RE


[Captioner] 20:26:49
GOING TO BE DUE FOR A BREAK IN A


[Captioner] 20:26:50
LITTLE BIT.


[Captioner] 20:26:51
>> Councilmember Shao: SURE.


[Captioner] 20:26:52
THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR.


[Captioner] 20:26:55
I FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE UNTIL I GET


[Captioner] 20:26:55
ANSWERS.


[Captioner] 20:27:00
SO ONE IS A FOLLOW-UP TO


[Captioner] 20:27:03
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN'S


[Captioner] 20:27:04
QUESTION REGARDING THE CLEANING


[Captioner] 20:27:04
OF THE BIKE LANE.


[Captioner] 20:27:08
I REALLY DON'T WANT US TO SHOOT


[Captioner] 20:27:09
OURSELVES IN THE FOOT BY MAKING


[Captioner] 20:27:11
THE CLEANING OF THE BIKE LANE


[Captioner] 20:27:16
MORE DIFFICULT OR MORE COSTLY BY


[Captioner] 20:27:19
IMPLEMENTING THOSE CONCRETE
BARRIERS.


[Captioner] 20:27:20
SO WHAT'S YOUR RESPONSE?


[Captioner] 20:27:23
>> Mr. Larsen: THERE WOULD BE


[Captioner] 20:27:24
NO CHANGE.


[Captioner] 20:27:27
>> Councilmember Shao: THE


[Captioner] 20:27:29
SECOND ONE IS THAT TO YOUR


[Captioner] 20:27:33
KNOWLEDGE, IS THERE AN INCIDENT


[Captioner] 20:27:37
IN THE LAST THREE TO FIVE YEARS


[Captioner] 20:27:39
OR EVER SINCE WELL INSTALLED


[Captioner] 20:27:46
THOSE GREEN BOLLARDS, THERE'S


[Captioner] 20:27:47
TRAFFIC ACCIDENT WHERE THE


[Captioner] 20:27:48
VEHICLE ACCIDENTALLY HIT THE


[Captioner] 20:27:49
BOLLARD, CAME INTO THE BIKE


[Captioner] 20:27:50
LANE, AND HIT SOMEONE.


[Captioner] 20:27:54
OR IS THIS JUST A FEAR, WHAT
IF?


[Captioner] 20:27:58
>> Mr. Larsen: YEAH, ACTUALLY


[Captioner] 20:27:59
I BELIEVE IT WAS LAST YEAR, WE


[Captioner] 20:28:02
HAD A PERSON DRIVING A VEHICLE,


[Captioner] 20:28:05
FELL ASLEEP, AND THEY BASICALLY


[Captioner] 20:28:09
WENT INTO A PROTECTED BIKE LANE


[Captioner] 20:28:11
AREA, HIT AND KILLED A PERSON


[Captioner] 20:28:13
WHO WAS ACTUALLY WALKING THEIR


[Captioner] 20:28:14
BICYCLE WITHIN THE LANE.


[Captioner] 20:28:16
THEY JUMPED THE CURB AND HIT A
TREE.


[Captioner] 20:28:22
SO THIS WAS ON THE CURVE AT


[Captioner] 20:28:23
DRISCOLL, AS YOU'RE APPROACHING


[Captioner] 20:28:27
KIND OF THE FUTURE BART STATION
AREA.


[Captioner] 20:28:29
SO THAT'S A CASE WHERE THE LEVEL


[Captioner] 20:28:31
OF PROTECTION OF THE BIKE LANE


[Captioner] 20:28:34
WITH JUST THE PLASTIC BOLLARDS


[Captioner] 20:28:35
IS NOT SUFFICIENT.


[Captioner] 20:28:37
YOU KNOW, IT'S HARD TO SAY IF


[Captioner] 20:28:39
SOMEBODY FELL ASLEEP AT A CURB,


[Captioner] 20:28:41
YOU KNOW, THEY WOULD PROBABLY --


[Captioner] 20:28:43
YOU MAY HAVE HAD THE SAME RESULT


[Captioner] 20:28:46
IN THAT THEY WOULD HAVE JUST


[Captioner] 20:28:48
JUMPED THE BIKE LANE CURB AS


[Captioner] 20:28:49
WELL, BUT I THINK THERE'S A LOT


[Captioner] 20:28:52
OF CASES WHERE THAT DOES PROVIDE


[Captioner] 20:28:53
A HIGHER LEVEL OF PROTECTION


[Captioner] 20:28:54
THAN WHAT YOU HAVE NOW.


[Captioner] 20:28:59
SO WE'RE LOOKING TO MINIMIZE THE


[Captioner] 20:29:00
ODDS OF SOMETHING BAD
HAPPENING.


[Captioner] 20:29:04
BUT WE DO HAVE INSTANCES IN


[Captioner] 20:29:06
OUR -- IN FREMONT WHERE WE'VE


[Captioner] 20:29:08
HAD PEOPLE CROSS THE LANES AND


[Captioner] 20:29:09
BAD THINGS HAVE HAPPENED.


[Captioner] 20:29:10
>> Councilmember Shao: THANK
YOU.


[Captioner] 20:29:11
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:29:12
COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL.


[Captioner] 20:29:16
>> Councilmember Campbell: MY


[Captioner] 20:29:17
QUESTION HAS BEEN ANSWERED.


[Captioner] 20:29:17
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:29:18
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:29:19
COUNCILMEMBER COX.


[Captioner] 20:29:24
>> Vice Mayor Cox: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:29:26
A LOT OF MY QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN


[Captioner] 20:29:28
ANSWERED, BUT I DID HAVE ONE IN


[Captioner] 20:29:32
TERMS OF LOOKING AT THE WHITE


[Captioner] 20:29:36
CONCRETE BARRIER, IS IT REALLY A


[Captioner] 20:29:38
STEP THE SAME LEVEL SIZED AS


[Captioner] 20:29:41
LIKE A PARKING LOT CONCRETE


[Captioner] 20:29:43
BLOCK AS YOU DRIVE YOUR CAR IN


[Captioner] 20:29:44
TO PARK AT A SHOPPING CENTER?


[Captioner] 20:29:47
IS THAT KIND OF LIKE THE SAME


[Captioner] 20:29:48
DIMENSIONS FROM LOOKING AT YOUR


[Captioner] 20:29:48
PICTURE?


[Captioner] 20:29:55
>> I THINK THEY HAVE A SIX-INCH


[Captioner] 20:29:55
HEIGHT.


[Captioner] 20:29:56
IT'S NOT EXACTLY THE SAME TYPE.


[Captioner] 20:29:58
IT HAS LIKE A LITTLE DIFFERENT


[Captioner] 20:30:01
ANGLE ON IT AND IT HAS A LONGER


[Captioner] 20:30:02
LENGTH THAN WHAT YOU WOULD SEE


[Captioner] 20:30:05
AT A -- IN A PARKING LOT AS A


[Captioner] 20:30:05
WHEEL CURB STOP.


[Captioner] 20:30:09
SO THERE IS SPECIFICALLY DESIGN


[Captioner] 20:30:11
FOR THIS TYPE OF APPLICATION, AS


[Captioner] 20:30:12
PART OF A PROTECTED BIKE LANE.


[Captioner] 20:30:15
>> Vice Mayor Cox: OKAY.


[Captioner] 20:30:17
MY OTHER QUESTION IS THAT WHITE


[Captioner] 20:30:18
CASING, HOW HARD IS IT?


[Captioner] 20:30:21
IS THAT THE SAME KIND OF


[Captioner] 20:30:22
MATERIAL THAT WOULD BE SIMILAR


[Captioner] 20:30:25
TO WHAT'S ON THE GREEN
BOLLARDS?


[Captioner] 20:30:27
IS THAT THE SAME?


[Captioner] 20:30:31
>> Mr. Larsen: SO WE'RE NOT


[Captioner] 20:30:34
REPLACING THE GREEN BOLLARDS --


[Captioner] 20:30:35
>> Vice Mayor Cox: NO I'M


[Captioner] 20:30:35
TALKING ABOUT THE MATERIAL ON


[Captioner] 20:30:37
THE WHITE CONCRETE, IS THAT THE


[Captioner] 20:30:39
SAME HARDNESS AS THE BOLLARDS?


[Captioner] 20:30:40
OR DIFFERENT?


[Captioner] 20:30:42
>> Mr. Larsen: SO THE BOLLARDS


[Captioner] 20:30:43
ARE -- IT'S HOLLOW PLASTIC.


[Captioner] 20:30:45
SO IT KIND OF LOOKS MORE


[Captioner] 20:30:46
SUBSTANTIAL THAN WHAT IT IS, BUT


[Captioner] 20:30:47
IT'S JUST PLASTIC.


[Captioner] 20:30:49
AND IT'S HOLLOW.


[Captioner] 20:30:54
SO THE CONCRETE, YOU KNOW, IS


[Captioner] 20:30:56
SIMILAR TO A CURB STOP, IT'S


[Captioner] 20:30:58
JUST UNIFORMLY CONCRETE, SO IT'S


[Captioner] 20:31:01
HARD, IT'S DURABLE, AND YOU


[Captioner] 20:31:03
KNOW, IF A CAR HITS IT FROM THE


[Captioner] 20:31:06
SIDE, THEY'LL BE ABLE TO FEEL IT


[Captioner] 20:31:07
AND DEFLECT BACK INTO THEIR
LANE.


[Captioner] 20:31:11
SO IT REGULAR STANDARD, YOU


[Captioner] 20:31:11
KNOW, CONCRETE MATERIAL.


[Captioner] 20:31:14
>> Vice Mayor Cox: OKAY.


[Captioner] 20:31:16
AND IT JUST WRAPPED IN THAT


[Captioner] 20:31:17
WHITE MATERIAL THAT IS A


[Captioner] 20:31:19
PROTECTIVE -- AN EXTRA BARRIER


[Captioner] 20:31:20
OF PROTECTION?


[Captioner] 20:31:21
>> Mr. Larsen: YEAH, I THINK


[Captioner] 20:31:23
WHAT MAY HAVE BEEN CONFUSING IS


[Captioner] 20:31:29
THAT THE -- WE DO HAVE A DEVICE


[Captioner] 20:31:33
IN THE PROTECTED BIKE LANE BY


[Captioner] 20:31:34
AMERICAN HIGH SCHOOL, THAT IS A


[Captioner] 20:31:35
PLASTIC PRODUCT AND IT IS


[Captioner] 20:31:36
HOLDING A PLASTIC POST.


[Captioner] 20:31:38
SO THIS IS SOMETHING DIFFERENT.


[Captioner] 20:31:41
THIS WILL BE THE FIRST TIME THAT


[Captioner] 20:31:44
WE'VE TRIED OUT THIS MATERIAL,


[Captioner] 20:31:45
AND BECAUSE IT'S CONCRETE, IT


[Captioner] 20:31:47
WILL BE MORE DURABLE THAN THE


[Captioner] 20:31:50
PLASTIC PRODUCT THAT WE HAVE


[Captioner] 20:31:50
TRIED OUT ALREADY.


[Captioner] 20:31:52
KOCH COX OKAY.


[Captioner] 20:31:55
>> Vice Mayor Cox: OKAY.


[Captioner] 20:31:56
COULD YOU BRING UP THE PICTURE


[Captioner] 20:31:57
ONE MORE TIME AND IF IT'S


[Captioner] 20:31:59
POSSIBLE TO BLOW UP ONE MORE


[Captioner] 20:32:00
TIME TO SHOW WHAT'S THE ACTUAL


[Captioner] 20:32:01
CONCRETE PICTURES JUST SO I'M


[Captioner] 20:32:02
CLEAR ON THIS?


[Captioner] 20:32:03
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:32:05
>> IT WOULD BE THE SECOND -- SO


[Captioner] 20:32:08
THE ONE ON THE LEFT, SO THE BASE


[Captioner] 20:32:10
OF THE WHITE CURB THERE IS


[Captioner] 20:32:12
ACTUALLY A PLASTIC MATERIAL, AND


[Captioner] 20:32:16
THEN IT'S HOLDING A WHITE POST.


[Captioner] 20:32:18
THE ONE ON THE RIGHT, SO THAT'S


[Captioner] 20:32:20
THE CUPERTINO EXAMPLE, AND SO


[Captioner] 20:32:23
THERE, THERE'S A LINE OF


[Captioner] 20:32:26
CONCRETE CUSHING.


[Captioner] 20:32:31
 CURB -- CONCRETE
CUSHING.


[Captioner] 20:32:33
THEY MAY LOOK THE SAME BUT ONE


[Captioner] 20:32:34
IS PLASTIC AND ONE IS CONCRETE.


[Captioner] 20:32:36
>> Vice Mayor Cox: OH, OKAY.


[Captioner] 20:32:36
I SEE.


[Captioner] 20:32:43
OH, THAT MAKES IT MUCH BETTER.


[Captioner] 20:32:43
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:32:48
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:32:49
COUNCILMEMBER KENG.


[Captioner] 20:32:51
>> Councilmember Keng: THANK


[Captioner] 20:32:52
YOU, MADAME MAYOR.


[Captioner] 20:32:54
JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY, ARE WE


[Captioner] 20:32:56
PROPOSING TO USE THE FREMONT


[Captioner] 20:32:58
EXAMPLE, RIGHT, WITH THE


[Captioner] 20:32:59
CONCRETE GREEN STRIPES?


[Captioner] 20:33:02
OR A COMBINATION OF THESE TWO?


[Captioner] 20:33:06
>> Mr. Larsen: SO ON THE LEFT,


[Captioner] 20:33:08
THE FREMONT BOULEVARD EXAMPLE,


[Captioner] 20:33:10
IF YOU REPLACE THE WHITE PLASTIC


[Captioner] 20:33:13
WITH THE POST, WITH ONE OF THE


[Captioner] 20:33:17
CUPERTINO CONCRETE PIECES,


[Captioner] 20:33:18
THAT'S WHAT WE WOULD BE DOING


[Captioner] 20:33:19
WITH THIS PROJECT.


[Captioner] 20:33:24
>> Councilmember Keng: SO NOT


[Captioner] 20:33:26
THE GREEN AND WHITE STRIPE


[Captioner] 20:33:27
CONCRETE POSTS?


[Captioner] 20:33:30
>> Mr. Larsen: SO THE GREEN


[Captioner] 20:33:33
POST, SO THAT'S A PLASTIC


[Captioner] 20:33:33
BOLLARD.


[Captioner] 20:33:37
SO THAT WOULD REMAIN KIND OF IN


[Captioner] 20:33:37
THIS EXAMPLE.


[Captioner] 20:33:39
SO RIGHT NOW, IF YOU GO TO THE


[Captioner] 20:33:43
FIRST PICTURE, WE JUST HAVE A --


[Captioner] 20:33:46
KIND OF A UNIFORM CLOSED SPACING


[Captioner] 20:33:47
OF THE GREEN PLASTIC BOLLARDS.


[Captioner] 20:33:51
SO WE WILL BE TAKING OUT EVERY


[Captioner] 20:33:53
OTHER ONE AND THEN PUTTING IN


[Captioner] 20:33:55
ONE OF THE CUPERTINO STYLE


[Captioner] 20:33:56
CONCRETE PANELS.


[Captioner] 20:33:58
IN THE CORRIDORS WHERE WE'RE


[Captioner] 20:34:02
DOING THIS, MANY OF THEM -- YOU


[Captioner] 20:34:05
KNOW, THE GREEN BOLLARD HAVE


[Captioner] 20:34:07
BEEN DAMAGED OR REMOVED, SO


[Captioner] 20:34:09
THERE'S AREAS WHICH HAVE NO KIND


[Captioner] 20:34:12
OF PHYSICAL PROTECTION THERE, SO


[Captioner] 20:34:14
WHERE WE HAVE THAT, YOU KNOW,


[Captioner] 20:34:16
WE'LL BE PUTTING BACK A GREEN


[Captioner] 20:34:18
BOLLARD AND ALTERNATING IT WITH


[Captioner] 20:34:21
THE CONCRETE PANEL.


[Captioner] 20:34:22
>> Councilmember Keng: THANK
YOU.


[Captioner] 20:34:25
THAT MAKES SENSE BECAUSE WE'VE


[Captioner] 20:34:28
BEEN HEARING AND AGREEING A LOT


[Captioner] 20:34:30
OF AGGRESSIVE DRIVING ESPECIALLY


[Captioner] 20:34:32
AROUND SCHOOLS AND WE HAVE A LOT


[Captioner] 20:34:35
OF VERY -- ON THEIR PHONES SO


[Captioner] 20:34:37
THAT'S WHY WE SEE ALL THESE


[Captioner] 20:34:40
PLASTIC BOLLARDS BEING LIKE


[Captioner] 20:34:43
DRIVEN OVER AND THAT PUTS ALL


[Captioner] 20:34:45
THE BICYCLISTS AT RISK AND EVEN


[Captioner] 20:34:47
THE PEDESTRIANS.


[Captioner] 20:34:50
SO I CAN SEE THE ONGOING CAUSE


[Captioner] 20:34:53
OF, YOU KNOW, MAINTENANCE COST


[Captioner] 20:34:54
OF THE PLASTIC, IF IT'S LIKE


[Captioner] 20:34:56
PLASTIC ONLY, AND PEOPLE, YOU


[Captioner] 20:34:59
KNOW, THINK THAT, OFF, IT WON'T


[Captioner] 20:35:02
DAMAGE PIE CAR IF I HIT IT AND


[Captioner] 20:35:07
PEOPLE PEOPLE ARE NOT PUTTING


[Captioner] 20:35:08
THEIR -- BECAUSE THEY'RE THERE


[Captioner] 20:35:10
AND CARS ARE SUPPOSED TO DRIVE


[Captioner] 20:35:12
WITHIN THEIR LANE, SO I WILL BE


[Captioner] 20:35:13
SUPPORTIVE OF THE CHANGE.


[Captioner] 20:35:15
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:35:16
>> Mr. Larsen: JUST TO ADD,


[Captioner] 20:35:18
APPRECIATE THAT, I THINK, YOU


[Captioner] 20:35:20
KNOW, ON PASEO PADRE PARKWAY, IN


[Captioner] 20:35:22
SORT OF NORTH FREMONT, THERE'S


[Captioner] 20:35:24
BEEN INSTANCES WHERE THE WE'LL


[Captioner] 20:35:26
LINE OF BOLLARDS HAS BEEN RUN
OVER.


[Captioner] 20:35:28
SO SOMEBODY PROBABLY A BIG


[Captioner] 20:35:30
TRUCK, BIG TIRES OR -- IS JUST


[Captioner] 20:35:31
GOING OVER THEM AND TAKING THEM
DOWN.


[Captioner] 20:35:34
SO PART OF THIS SOLUTION WHERE


[Captioner] 20:35:35
YOU HAVE THE RAISED CONCRETE


[Captioner] 20:35:39
THAT ALTERNATES WITH THAT, IT


[Captioner] 20:35:41
NOT GOING TO BE VERY EASY OR


[Captioner] 20:35:46
COMFORTABLE TO -- YOU KNOW, THAT


[Captioner] 20:35:48
VANDALIZE THEM THAT HAS BEEN


[Captioner] 20:35:49
DONE IN THE PAST.


[Captioner] 20:35:49
>> Councilmember Keng: THANK
YOU.


[Captioner] 20:35:50
>> Mayor Mei: WE HAVE A MOTION


[Captioner] 20:35:51
AND A SECOND.


[Captioner] 20:35:52
I'M GOING TO CALL THE QUESTION


[Captioner] 20:35:55
FOR THE VOTE, PLEASE.


[Captioner] 20:36:08
SO THE MOTION PASSES


[Captioner] 20:36:10
UNANIMOUSLY, AND BEFORE WE MOVE


[Captioner] 20:36:11
ON TO THE NEXT ITEM, WE ALSO


[Captioner] 20:36:13
HAVE THE ORDINANCE, PLEASE, IF


[Captioner] 20:36:15
YOU COULD SHARE THAT, CITY

[Captioner] 20:36:46
SO PLEASE NOTE THAT ITEM HAS


[Captioner] 20:36:48

 [ RECESS ]


[Captioner] 20:49:42
>> Mayor Mei:   WE'RE GOING TO 


[Captioner] 20:49:48
RETURN TO ITEM 6A, SABERCAT AND 


[Captioner] 20:49:51
MUSEUM PROJECTS.


[Captioner] 20:49:54
HANS LARSEN, WELCOME.


[Captioner] 20:49:56
>> Hans Larsen:   I HAVE A BRIEF 


[Captioner] 20:49:56
PRESENTATION.


[Captioner] 20:49:59
THIS IS MOSTLY A FEEL GOOD 


[Captioner] 20:50:01
REPORT IN TERMS OF THE GREAT 


[Captioner] 20:50:03
PROGRESS ON SABERCAT TRAIL.


[Captioner] 20:50:05
MAYBE SOME YOU WILL HAVE 


[Captioner] 20:50:10
SOMETHING YOU WANT TO GET TO 


[Captioner] 20:50:12
TONIGHT, HAPPY TO PASS ON THE 


[Captioner] 20:50:14
PRESENTATION, IT WILL BE ABOUT 


[Captioner] 20:50:15
TEN MINUTES.


[Captioner] 20:50:17
>> Mayor Mei:   POLL THE COUNTY, 


[Captioner] 20:50:20
YOU'D LIKE TO SEE IT?


[Captioner] 20:50:20
PASS?


[Captioner] 20:50:22
OKAY, HOW ABOUT THE REST OF THE 


[Captioner] 20:50:23
COUNCIL?


[Captioner] 20:50:25
WOULD ANYONE LIKE TO SEE IT?


[Captioner] 20:50:26
>> Councilmember Campbell:   NO 


[Captioner] 20:50:27
I'M OKAY WITH NOT SEEING IT.


[Captioner] 20:50:30
I DID HAVE A QUESTION THOUGH.


[Captioner] 20:50:31
>> Mayor Mei:   OKAY WE WILL 


[Captioner] 20:50:32
ALLOW QUESTIONS FOR SURE.


[Captioner] 20:50:36
SO DO YOU WANT TO BEGIN WITH THE 


[Captioner] 20:50:37
QUESTIONS?


[Captioner] 20:50:37
COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL.


[Captioner] 20:50:39
>> Councilmember Campbell:   I 


[Captioner] 20:50:40
DON'T HAVE THE PRESENTATION IN 


[Captioner] 20:50:42
FRONT OF ME SO I'M GOING OFF MY 


[Captioner] 20:50:45
MEMORY SO THAT MIGHT NOT BE TOO 


[Captioner] 20:50:45
HELPFUL.


[Captioner] 20:50:47
BUT IT'S ABOUT THE FUNDING.


[Captioner] 20:50:50
IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'VE GOTTEN 


[Captioner] 20:50:53
MAYBE ABOUT 17, A LITTLE OVER 


[Captioner] 20:50:53
$17 MILLION.


[Captioner] 20:50:56
BUT YOU NEED 50.


[Captioner] 20:50:59
>> Hans Larsen:   WELL, THERE'S 


[Captioner] 20:51:01
TWO THINGS THAT WE'RE PURSUING.


[Captioner] 20:51:04
ONE IS EXTENSION OF THE SABERCAT 


[Captioner] 20:51:06
TRAIL WITH THE BRIDGE OVER 680.


[Captioner] 20:51:09
AND THEN WE'RE ALSO PURSUING 


[Captioner] 20:51:15
A -- THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE 


[Captioner] 20:51:16
IRVINGTONIAN FOSSIL MUSEUM.


[Captioner] 20:51:20
MOST HAS BEEN LATED IS TOWARDS 


[Captioner] 20:51:22
THE TRAIL BUT WE NEED PLANNING 


[Captioner] 20:51:23
FOR THE MUSEUM.


[Captioner] 20:51:25
WE NEED ABOUT $25 MILLION TO 


[Captioner] 20:51:26
COMPLETE THE TRAIL PROJECT FOR 


[Captioner] 20:51:27
CONSTRUCTION.


[Captioner] 20:51:29
WITH THE FUNDING THAT WE HAVE, 


[Captioner] 20:51:31
WE WILL BRING THIS PROJECT TO A 


[Captioner] 20:51:32
POINT OF BEING READY OR THE 


[Captioner] 20:51:34
CONSTRUCTION AND WE'LL NEED $25 


[Captioner] 20:51:37
MILLION TO BUILD THE PROJECT.


[Captioner] 20:51:40
THE MUSEUM HAS AN ESTIMATED COST 


[Captioner] 20:51:41
ABOUT $50 MILLION.


[Captioner] 20:51:44
AND WE ONLY HAVE RESOURCES TO DO 


[Captioner] 20:51:48
PLANNING FOR IT AT THIS POINT.


[Captioner] 20:51:49
FTC.


[Captioner] 20:51:50
>> Councilmember Campbell:   


[Captioner] 20:51:50
OKAY.


[Captioner] 20:51:51
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:51:53
HE ACTUALLY BROUGHT IT TO ME.


[Captioner] 20:51:55
SO I APPRECIATE THAT.


[Captioner] 20:52:00
IT'S THE SUMMARY PAGE WHERE IT 


[Captioner] 20:52:03
TALKS ABOUT NEXT STEPS, OBTAIN 


[Captioner] 20:52:03
CONSTRUCTION FUNDING.


[Captioner] 20:52:05
SO IT LOOKS LIKE MOST OF THE 


[Captioner] 20:52:07
WORK HAS BEEN DONE BUT THE 


[Captioner] 20:52:10
FUNDING IS NOT THERE TO ACTUALLY 


[Captioner] 20:52:13
CONSTRUCT THE ACTUAL TRAIL.


[Captioner] 20:52:14
BRIDGE AND TRAIL EXTENSION.


[Captioner] 20:52:17
>> Hans Larsen:   THE FUNDING 


[Captioner] 20:52:19
HAD A WE RECEIVED FROM THE 


[Captioner] 20:52:21
STATE, I WOULD SAY THE TRAIL 


[Captioner] 20:52:23
WE'VE COMPLETED THE PLANNING.


[Captioner] 20:52:25
AND LAST YEAR, THE COUNCIL 


[Captioner] 20:52:26
APPROVED ENVIRONMENTAL CLEARANCE 


[Captioner] 20:52:28
FOR THE TRAIL EXTENSION PROJECT 


[Captioner] 20:52:29
INCLUDING THE BRIDGE.


[Captioner] 20:52:32
AND THEN WE HAVE MONEY FOR FINAL 


[Captioner] 20:52:34
DESIGN AND THERE'S SOME LAND 


[Captioner] 20:52:38
 


[Captioner] 20:52:39
ACQUISITION THAT'S NEEDED.


[Captioner] 20:52:42
SO THERE'S GOING TO BE WORK 


[Captioner] 20:52:43
ACTIVITIES PROBABLY THE NEXT 18 


[Captioner] 20:52:45
MONTHS AND THEN WE'LL BE READY 


[Captioner] 20:52:46
TO GO TO CONSTRUCTION IF WE CAN 


[Captioner] 20:52:48
SECURE THE ADDITIONAL $25 


[Captioner] 20:52:48
MILLION.


[Captioner] 20:52:49
SOME OF THE STATE MONEY THAT WE 


[Captioner] 20:52:53
DO HAVE IS A CONTRIBUTION 


[Captioner] 20:52:54
TWARTDZ CONSTRUCTION.


[Captioner] 20:52:57
 


[Captioner] 20:52:58
TOWARDS CONSTRUCTION SO WE'RE 


[Captioner] 20:53:00
LITTLE BIT OF THE WAY OF HAVING 


[Captioner] 20:53:02
THE CONSTRUCTION PHASE FUNDED.


[Captioner] 20:53:02
>> Councilmember Campbell:   IS 


[Captioner] 20:53:04
THERE ANY DISCUSSION?


[Captioner] 20:53:06
I KNOW WE'RE GOING TO HAVE OUR 


[Captioner] 20:53:07
BUDGET DISCUSSION IN THE NEXT 


[Captioner] 20:53:08
SEVERAL WEEKS.


[Captioner] 20:53:09
IS THERE ANY DISCUSSION ABOUT 


[Captioner] 20:53:11
THIS COMING FROM GENERAL FUNDS 


[Captioner] 20:53:13
OR CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT FUNDS OR 


[Captioner] 20:53:14
ANYTHING LIKE THAT?


[Captioner] 20:53:15
>> Hans Larsen:   NO.


[Captioner] 20:53:17
WE'RE NOT RECOMMENDING PUTTING 


[Captioner] 20:53:19
ANY CITY MONEY INTO THIS PROJECT 


[Captioner] 20:53:20
AT THIS TIME.


[Captioner] 20:53:25
WE ARE, YOU KNOW, WE'VE GOTTEN 


[Captioner] 20:53:26
THREE STATE GRANTS FOR THIS 


[Captioner] 20:53:27
PROJECT ALREADY.


[Captioner] 20:53:29
THE ENVIRONMENTAL CLEARANCE THAT 


[Captioner] 20:53:32
WE'RE PREPARING ALLOWS US TO BE 


[Captioner] 20:53:34
ELIGIBLE FOR FEDERAL MONEY SO WE 


[Captioner] 20:53:36
THINK THIS IS A REALLY EXCELLENT 


[Captioner] 20:53:38
PROJECT TO BE ABLE TO GET MONEY 


[Captioner] 20:53:41
FROM OUTSIDE SOURCES.


[Captioner] 20:53:43
WE MIGHT HAVE TO PUT A LITTLE 


[Captioner] 20:53:44
BIT MORE IN BUT THAT WOULD 


[Captioner] 20:53:45
LIKELY COME THERE OUR 


[Captioner] 20:53:47
TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM.


[Captioner] 20:53:47
>> Councilmember Campbell:   


[Captioner] 20:53:48
TRANSPORTATION, OKAY.


[Captioner] 20:53:49
SO THAT'S THE TRAIL AND THE 


[Captioner] 20:53:50
BRIDGE.


[Captioner] 20:53:52
NOW MUSEUM WHICH LOOKS LIKE IT'S 


[Captioner] 20:53:53
GOING TO BE PHENOMENAL.


[Captioner] 20:53:55
I'M SURE THAT THE KIDS WOULD 


[Captioner] 20:53:56
ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS MUSEUM.


[Captioner] 20:53:59
IT'S GOING TO BE AN ATTRACTION 


[Captioner] 20:54:01
FROM ALL OVER THE BAY TO COME 


[Captioner] 20:54:04
SEE THIS MUSEUM BUT YOU NEED AN 


[Captioner] 20:54:06
ADDITIONAL $50 MILLION TO -- FOR 


[Captioner] 20:54:09
CONSTRUCTION OF THAT.


[Captioner] 20:54:10
AND DESIGN.


[Captioner] 20:54:11
DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION, 


[Captioner] 20:54:12
ACCORDING TO WHAT WE HAVE IN 


[Captioner] 20:54:14
FRONT OF US.


[Captioner] 20:54:15
WHAT KIND OF PROGRESS ARE WE 


[Captioner] 20:54:19
MAKING TO SECURE THOSE FUNDS?


[Captioner] 20:54:21
>> Hans Larsen:   SO THE WORK 


[Captioner] 20:54:23
THAT WE'RE DOING AND PART OF 


[Captioner] 20:54:24
WHAT'S RECOMMENDED HERE IS TO 


[Captioner] 20:54:27
CONTINUE TO DO STUDY WORK FOR 


[Captioner] 20:54:27
IT.


[Captioner] 20:54:29
SO KIND OF SOME OF THE EXCITING 


[Captioner] 20:54:31
WORK THAT'S HAPPENING IS WE HAVE 


[Captioner] 20:54:33
A SITE THAT'S LOCATED ON THE 


[Captioner] 20:54:36
HILL AT THE CURVE OF 680.


[Captioner] 20:54:37
AND, YOU KNOW, IF YOU HAVE BEEN 


[Captioner] 20:54:40
DOWN TO L.A. AND THE GETTY 


[Captioner] 20:54:43
MUSEUM THAT YOU SEE OFF OF 405 


[Captioner] 20:54:45
YOU KNOW IT SORT OF HAS THAT 


[Captioner] 20:54:47
EFFECT THAT IT HAS SORT OF GREAT 


[Captioner] 20:54:50
VISIBILITY TO PEOPLE PASSING BY 


[Captioner] 20:54:51
IT IN THE REGION WE'RE GOING TO 


[Captioner] 20:54:53
HAVE THE BEAUTIFUL SABERCAT 


[Captioner] 20:54:54
RIDGE NEXT TO IT.


[Captioner] 20:54:56
SO WE HAVE A LOCATION SELECTED.


[Captioner] 20:54:59
IT'S ON STATE-OWNED PROPERTY BUT 


[Captioner] 20:55:04
IT'S CalTRANS PROPERTY.


[Captioner] 20:55:07
WE ARE LOOKING TO GET IT 


[Captioner] 20:55:10
TRANSFERRED SO IT CAN BE USED BY 


[Captioner] 20:55:13
THE CLAWF NATIONAL RESOURCE 


[Captioner] 20:55:13
AGENCY.


[Captioner] 20:55:15
WE HAVE THE SITE SECURED AND 


[Captioner] 20:55:16
WE'RE WORKING ON ENVIRONMENTAL 


[Captioner] 20:55:17
CLEARANCE FOR THE MUSEUM 


[Captioner] 20:55:19
FACILITY AND THEN WHAT'S 


[Captioner] 20:55:22
RECOMMENDED HERE IS AN AGREEMENT 


[Captioner] 20:55:25
WITH THE MASS SCIENCE NUCLEUS TO 


[Captioner] 20:55:27
ESSENTIALLY WORK WITH U.C. 


[Captioner] 20:55:30
BERKELEY MUSEUM OF PALEONTOLOGY.


[Captioner] 20:55:33
AND SO WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A 


[Captioner] 20:55:34
REALLY STRONG STATE PARTNERSHIP 


[Captioner] 20:55:35
ON THIS PROJECT AS WELL AS 


[Captioner] 20:55:37
EXPERTS FROM ACROSS THE COUNTRY 


[Captioner] 20:55:39
TO HELP SORT OF FIGURE OUT SORT 


[Captioner] 20:55:42
OF THE SCIENTIFIC CONTENT OF 


[Captioner] 20:55:44
WHAT GOES INTO THE MUSEUM.


[Captioner] 20:55:46
IN OUR PRESENTATION WE SHOWED 


[Captioner] 20:55:52
PHOTOS OF THE LA BREA TAR PITS 


[Captioner] 20:55:52
MUSEUM.


[Captioner] 20:55:53
THIS IS SOMETHING ALONG THOSE 


[Captioner] 20:55:55
LINES BUT WE'LL BE ABLE TO MAKE 


[Captioner] 20:55:57
A BETTER KIND OF MARKETING CASE 


[Captioner] 20:55:59
FOR WHY THIS MUSEUM IS IMPORTANT 


[Captioner] 20:56:00
AND THAT WILL BE CRITICAL TO TRY 


[Captioner] 20:56:05
TO HELP SECURE INVESTMENT 


[Captioner] 20:56:08
DONATIONS, NONPROFIT, YOU KNOW, 


[Captioner] 20:56:09
OTHER GOVERNMENT INVESTMENT AND 


[Captioner] 20:56:11
PUTTING IT TOGETHER.


[Captioner] 20:56:12
ON E-SO IN A WAY IT'S KIND OF 


[Captioner] 20:56:14
LIKE THE APPROACH THAT WE'VE 


[Captioner] 20:56:16
TAKEN WITH THE NEW CENTRAL PARK 


[Captioner] 20:56:17
COMMUNITY CENTER.


[Captioner] 20:56:19
THERE'S SOME CITY MONEY IN 


[Captioner] 20:56:20
THERE, WE'VE GOT SOME STATE 


[Captioner] 20:56:23
GRANTS BUT WE ARE RELYING ON, 


[Captioner] 20:56:24
YOU KNOW, SOME OTHER PRIVATE OR 


[Captioner] 20:56:26
GRANT MONEYS TO BE ABLE TO FULLY 


[Captioner] 20:56:27
BUILD THAT PROJECT.


[Captioner] 20:56:30
THAT'S A $58 MILLION PROJECT.


[Captioner] 20:56:31
SO WE'VE GOT TWO REALLY COOL 


[Captioner] 20:56:32
BUILDINGS WE'RE TRYING TO 


[Captioner] 20:56:34
DEVELOP HERE IN FREMONT.


[Captioner] 20:56:34
>> Councilmember Campbell:   


[Captioner] 20:56:35
THANK YOU FOR THAT.


[Captioner] 20:56:37
SO ARE YOU -- WHAT IS YOUR 


[Captioner] 20:56:38
CONFIDENCE LEVEL IN TERMS OF 


[Captioner] 20:56:39
BEING ABLE TO GET THE FUNDING 


[Captioner] 20:56:41
THAT YOU NEED TO MOVE THIS 


[Captioner] 20:56:44
FORWARD?


[Captioner] 20:56:45
>> Hans Larsen:   WELL I THINK 


[Captioner] 20:56:46
AT THE -- WITH THESE ACTIONS 


[Captioner] 20:56:48
HERE ON THE MUSEUM, WE SHOULD 


[Captioner] 20:56:50
HAVE A REALLY GOOD PLAN IN PLACE 


[Captioner] 20:56:54
TO BE ABLE TO PROMOTE AND MARKET 


[Captioner] 20:56:55
IT AND TRY TO BRING IN 


[Captioner] 20:56:56
FOUNDATION MONEY OR OTHER STATE 


[Captioner] 20:56:58
AND FEDERAL GRANTS.


[Captioner] 20:57:00
SO, YOU KNOW, I'VE NEVER BEEN 


[Captioner] 20:57:01
INVOLVED WITH DOING A MUSEUM 


[Captioner] 20:57:03
BEFORE BUT THIS IS 


[Captioner] 20:57:04
SUPER-EXCITING.


[Captioner] 20:57:07
AND AS YOU POINTED OUT I MEAN 


[Captioner] 20:57:11
JUST THE UNIQUE EXTRAORDINARY 


[Captioner] 20:57:13
HISTORY IN FREMONT, AROUND YOU 


[Captioner] 20:57:15
KNOW WHAT WAS HERE A MILLION, 


[Captioner] 20:57:16
TWO MILLION YEARS AGO.


[Captioner] 20:57:19
THERE'S A LOT TO BE LEARNED.


[Captioner] 20:57:21
THIS WILL BE ATTRACTION FOR 


[Captioner] 20:57:23
SCHOOL KIDS FROM ACROSS THE BAY 


[Captioner] 20:57:26
AREA, A TOURIST ATTRACTION FROM 


[Captioner] 20:57:27
ACROSS THE COUNTRY TO COME SEE 


[Captioner] 20:57:28
SOMETHING LIKE THIS.


[Captioner] 20:57:30
SO WE THINK IT HAS A LOT OF 


[Captioner] 20:57:32
POTENTIAL, AND BEING A MAGNET 


[Captioner] 20:57:34
FOR THE RESOURCES TO MAKE IT 


[Captioner] 20:57:35
HAPPEN.


[Captioner] 20:57:35
>> Councilmember Campbell:   


[Captioner] 20:57:36
GREAT JOB.


[Captioner] 20:57:36
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:57:38
LET ME KNOW WHAT I COULD DO TO 


[Captioner] 20:57:39
HELP.


[Captioner] 20:57:40
>> Hans Larsen:   WILL DO.


[Captioner] 20:57:40
>> Councilmember Campbell:   


[Captioner] 20:57:45
OKAY.


[Captioner] 20:57:45
>> Mayor Mei:   COUNCILMEMBER 


[Captioner] 20:57:46
KENG.


[Captioner] 20:57:47
>> Councilmember Keng:   THANK 


[Captioner] 20:57:48
YOU, MADAM MAYOR.


[Captioner] 20:57:50
SO I WAS ALSO WANTING TO FIND 


[Captioner] 20:57:51
OUT MORE ABOUT WHERE THE FUNDING 


[Captioner] 20:57:55
FOR THE CONSTRUCTION ARE AT.


[Captioner] 20:57:57
SO I THINK WE WILL REALLY BE 


[Captioner] 20:57:59
TRYING TO LOCATE AND MAKE SURE 


[Captioner] 20:58:01
THAT WE HAVE THE FUNDING.


[Captioner] 20:58:04
BECAUSE THE PLANS LOOK AMAZING.


[Captioner] 20:58:07
AND IT WILL, YOU KNOW, LIKE 


[Captioner] 20:58:08
COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL WAS 


[Captioner] 20:58:11
TALKING ABOUT, THIS IS A HUGE 


[Captioner] 20:58:13
IMPROVEMENT FROM THE CURRENT 


[Captioner] 20:58:15
CENTER, ON FREMONT BOULEVARD 


[Captioner] 20:58:18
WHICH IS KIND OF LIKE A HIDDEN 


[Captioner] 20:58:21
GEM BUT IT REALLY NEEDS A LOT OF 


[Captioner] 20:58:22
UPDATING TO BRING IT UP TO THE 


[Captioner] 20:58:23
MODERN DESIGN.


[Captioner] 20:58:26
BUT YOU KNOW, THIS KIND OF 


[Captioner] 20:58:28
EDUCATIONAL AND FAMILY-FRIENDLY 


[Captioner] 20:58:31
KIND OF ATTRACTION AND YOU KNOW 


[Captioner] 20:58:34
BEING IN THE NATURE, IT IS KIND 


[Captioner] 20:58:39
OF ALL ENCOMPASSING ATTRACTION 


[Captioner] 20:58:42
THAT FAMILIES CAN BRING THEIR 


[Captioner] 20:58:44
KIDS TO FROM ALL AROUND THE 


[Captioner] 20:58:44
AREA.


[Captioner] 20:58:45
DEFINITELY LOOKING FORWARD TO 


[Captioner] 20:58:46
BRINGING THIS TO REALITY.


[Captioner] 20:58:50
>> Mayor Mei:   COUNCILMEMBER 


[Captioner] 20:58:51
SHAO.


[Captioner] 20:58:52

[Captioner] 20:59:03

[Captioner] 20:59:06
THAT I'VE BEEN A FAN OF JOYCE 


[Captioner] 20:59:11
BLUEFORD AND MATH NUCLEUS DURING 


[Captioner] 20:59:11
MANY YEARS.


[Captioner] 20:59:13
AND SOME OF THE WORST TIMES FOR 


[Captioner] 20:59:16
BUDGETS THEY WERE ABLE TO SECURE 


[Captioner] 20:59:17
SOME OF THIS CURRICULUM.


[Captioner] 20:59:20
FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVEN'T HAD 


[Captioner] 20:59:24
A CHANCE TO VISIT THE MUSEUM AND 


[Captioner] 20:59:25
ACRES RIGHT THERE, IT IS A GREAT 


[Captioner] 20:59:26
OPPORTUNITY.


[Captioner] 20:59:28
IT IS TRULY AN EXAMPLE WHERE WE 


[Captioner] 20:59:30
CAN HOPEFULLY SHOWCASE BOTH THE 


[Captioner] 20:59:32
PAST WITH THE FOSSILS AND THE 


[Captioner] 20:59:34
FUTURE AND THE FUTURE AND I 


[Captioner] 20:59:36
THINK THIS IS AN EXCELLENT 


[Captioner] 20:59:37
SHOWCASE AND IT WILL BE 


[Captioner] 20:59:39
SOMETHING THAT WILL HELP PUT US 


[Captioner] 20:59:41
ON THE MAP LITERALLY AND ALSO IN 


[Captioner] 20:59:44
TERMS OF HELPING INSPIRE FUTURE 


[Captioner] 20:59:44

[Captioner] 21:01:41
>> Councilmember Salwan:   I'LL 


[Captioner] 21:01:42
KEEP IT BRIEF SINCE I KNOW 


[Captioner] 21:01:44
EVERYBODY'S READY TO GO.


[Captioner] 21:01:46
ONE WAS THAT WE HAD THE EAST BAY 


[Captioner] 21:01:48
PARK DISTRICT AND CITY OF 


[Captioner] 21:01:50
FREMONT LIAISON COMMITTEE AND WE 


[Captioner] 21:01:52
DISCUSSED THE MISSION PEAK LEASE 


[Captioner] 21:01:53
THAT WILL BE COMING BEFORE US 


[Captioner] 21:01:54
NEXT WEEK.


[Captioner] 21:01:56
FOR THE ENTIRE CITY COUNCIL TO 


[Captioner] 21:01:56
VOTE ON.


[Captioner] 21:01:59
AND SECOND, I ATTENDED THE ACTC 


[Captioner] 21:02:03
MEETING ON BEHALF OF THE MAYOR.


[Captioner] 21:02:04
AND WE VOTED FOR SOME PROJECTS 


[Captioner] 21:02:07
AND ALSO, I RAISED THE CONCERN 


[Captioner] 21:02:10
ABOUT THE CURRENT FUNDING, WHICH 


[Captioner] 21:02:13
FOWBLTIONS ON HISTORICALLY 


[Captioner] 21:02:15
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES THAT 


[Captioner] 21:02:16
LEAVES CITY OF FREMONT OUT OF A 


[Captioner] 21:02:18
LOT OF FUNDING SO I DID RAISE 


[Captioner] 21:02:19
THAT CONCERN.


[Captioner] 21:02:28
AND THERE IS A 2023 DESIGNATION 


[Captioner] 21:02:31
WHICH CERTAIN AREAS AROUND 


[Captioner] 21:02:34
GRIMMER AND CABRILLO AREA WHICH 


[Captioner] 21:02:35
DO QUALIFY.


[Captioner] 21:02:37
I MADE THE POINT THAT CITY OF 


[Captioner] 21:02:39
FREMONT NEEDS TO BE FACTORED IN 


[Captioner] 21:02:40
CONSIDERING OUR LARGE GEOGRAPHIC 


[Captioner] 21:02:43
AREA AND THE HIGH GENERATION 


[Captioner] 21:02:45
THAT WE DO HERE WE NEED TO MAKE 


[Captioner] 21:02:46
SURE WE GET OUR FAIR SHARE.


[Captioner] 21:02:48
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 21:02:48
>> Mayor Mei:   REAL QUICKLY I 


[Captioner] 21:02:50
WANTED TO THANK THIS MONTH WAS 


[Captioner] 21:02:52

[Captioner] 21:03:00
OUR LOCAL NEIGHBORHOOD 


[Captioner] 21:03:00
DISTRICTS.


[Captioner] 21:03:03
AND THEN I ALSO SAW MANY OF YOU

CELEBRATE FOR THE OHLONE DEAF 


[Captioner] 21:03:17
