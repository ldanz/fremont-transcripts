[Note to readers: For some reason this meeting had both the human stenocaptioner (the part in all-caps) and the Zoom autocaptioner (the lines that include lower-case letters).  There was at least one section where the human-captioned part did not appear, so I've left both versions in this document.  Where available, the all-caps section will be more accurate.]

ONCE AGAIN, THE HISTORY

[City of Fremont] 19:12:37
Policy fits all I remember in 2019. The rank control was put on a ballot, and majority of California's.

[Captioner] 19:12:38
 PROVES
THAT IT'S NOT ALWAYS ONE POLICY
FITS ALL.


[Captioner] 19:12:42
I REMEMBER IN 2018, WHEN THE
RENT

[Captioner] 19:12:45
 CONTROL WAS PUT ON THE
BALLOT AND MAJORITY

[City of Fremont] 19:12:46
So voters voted No, and over here it already showed over the years that that the Brand Review Board is the right approach for us to on my hand, protect the interests and benefits of the tenants, but on the other hand, also protect the interests of a lot of

[Captioner] 19:12:48
 OF
CALIFORNIA'S VOTERS

[Captioner] 19:12:52
 VOTED NO.
AND OVER HERE, IT ALREADY SHOWED
OVER THE

[Captioner] 19:12:55
 YEARS THAT THE RENT
REVIEW BOARD IS

[Captioner] 19:12:59
 THE RIGHT
APPROACH FOR

[Captioner] 19:13:04
 US TO, ON ONE HAND,
PROTECT THE INTEREST AND


[Captioner] 19:13:07
BENEFITS OF THE TENANTS BUT ON
THE OTHER

[Captioner] 19:13:11
 HAND ALSO PROTECT THE
INTERESTS OF A

[City of Fremont] 19:13:11
senior people who would adjust the a house rented out for investment, so called, moms and Pops brand new houses for making living and in joining their retirements.

[Captioner] 19:13:15

[Captioner] 19:13:28
 MAKING A
LIVING AND ENJOYING THEIR

and that is all I have to say

[City of Fremont] 19:13:49
Thank you, Seeing no other comments from the Council I'll make some comments on this.

[City of Fremont] 19:13:55
I wanted to thank our staff and also the community members and our Rent Review Commission, who've helped out and serving.

[City of Fremont] 19:14:03
It's great that we were able to do education in the past with both the landlords and the tenants, and to be able to have a process that seems to be working well for our city it's important for us to have these annual reports as we had committed to accountability and terms

[City of Fremont] 19:14:21
of looking at the different cases that have been received, and then I definitely concur with the rest of the Council that it's very reasonable increase in the fee.

[City of Fremont] 19:14:33
We have worked very hard in this time period, I want to thank are staff and team for making sure that when it came to delivering the rental assistance, the over 16 million we're really grateful that we were able to do so and having experience in the past with the community block development.

[City of Fremont] 19:14:50
Grant be able to prep our relationships with both the tenets and landlords, to ensure that the process was one that was successfully fulfilled.

[City of Fremont] 19:14:57
I even saw people I know during our summer concerts in the parks, and our people that were giving out the information in multiple languages, which I think is also very important for access, and So I just wanted to commend the staff and say that this is a public hearing and I would like to get a motion to adopt

[City of Fremont] 19:15:13
the resolution for the master Fee schedule, please.

[City of Fremont] 19:15:17
So I move to except staff recommendation, including the authorization of an increase in the fee, and to about the resolution to amend the master fee schedule to reflect that change Okay, see? A motion.

[City of Fremont] 19:15:34
And I see it current. I guess the second would be Council Member Kang, because I see it on the screen, and so, if we can vote, please thank you.

COMMUNITY MEETING AND PUT IT

[Captioner] 19:22:35
 UP
ON THE NEW WEBSITE BUT I'M
WONDERING IF

[Captioner] 19:22:38
 ANY OUTREACH WAS
DONE TO PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY
PRIOR TO THAT

[Captioner] 19:22:41
 WHILE THE
ORDINANCE WAS IN THE PROCESS OF
BEING DRAFTED.


[City of Fremont] 19:22:42
advocates for urban agriculture people who already have chickens or bees or goats.

[Captioner] 19:22:44
WAS THERE ANY OUTREACH TO


[Captioner] 19:22:47
ADVOCATES FOR URBAN AGRICULTURE
OR PEOPLE WHO ALREADY HAVE


[City of Fremont] 19:22:49
what kind of outreach was done during that, you know, about 1215 month timeframe of of the drafting process

[Captioner] 19:22:51
CHICKENS OR BEES OR GOATS, WHAT
KIND OF OUTREACH WAS

[Captioner] 19:22:54
 DONE

[Captioner] 19:22:58
 DURING
THAT 15-MONTH TIME FRAME OF THE
DRAFTING PROCESS?


[Kelly Miott] 19:22:59
So we this is these are all based on the best professional recommendation and analysis, and similar city ordinances, and we currently do not have any goat permitees in the city.

[Captioner] 19:23:04
>> SO THESE ARE ALL BASED ON THE
BEST

[Captioner] 19:23:07
 PROFESSIONAL RECOMMENDATION
AND ANALYSIS OF SIMILAR CITY


[Captioner] 19:23:12
ORDINANCES, AND WE CURRENTLY DO
NOT HAVE

[Kelly Miott] 19:23:15
and we have 5 people that currently have beehive comments and 4 people that residents that have chicken permits.

[Captioner] 19:23:15
 ANY GOAT PERMITEES IN
THE CITY, AND WE

[Captioner] 19:23:19
 HAVE FIVE
PEOPLE THAT CURRENTLY HAVE
BEEHIVE

[Captioner] 19:23:22
 PERMITS, AND FOUR PEOPLE
THAT -- RESIDENTS THAT HAVE


[Kelly Miott] 19:23:23
So we were looking for big picture and looking at other cities, ordinances

[Captioner] 19:23:26
CHICKEN PERMITS.
SO WE WERE LOOKING FOR BIG
PICTURE AND

[City of Fremont] 19:23:29
So just so no community outreach was done to those people while you were drafting it

[Captioner] 19:23:29
 LOOKING AT OTHER
CITY'S ORDINANCES.


[Captioner] 19:23:35
>> Councilmember Kassan: SO NO
COMMUNITY OUTREACH WAS DONE TO


[Captioner] 19:23:38
THOSE PEOPLE WHILE YOU WERE
DRAFTING IT?
>> I DID GET FEEDBACK FROM QUITE


[Captioner] 19:23:41

[Captioner] 19:23:44

Good for neighbors, and also good for healthy bees, which have considerable problems surviving for many years Now, as as you've probably heard, we've researched different policy approaches in that time, and worked with many cities to change restrictive, regulations and to develop what we call win-win

there's considerable interest in Fremont to recognize and encourage good beekeeping practices in the city.

[Captioner] 19:25:36
 TO
BEE KEEPING REGULATIONS.


[Captioner] 19:25:39
THERE'S CONSIDERABLE INTEREST IN
FREMONT

[Captioner] 19:25:42
 TO RECOGNIZE AND
ENCOURAGE GOOD BEE KEEPING
PRACTICES IN THE

[Nickie Irvine] 19:25:42
So changing the old ordinance will have widespread support in the community.

[Captioner] 19:25:46
 CITY, SO
CHANGING THE OLD ORDINANCE WILL
HAVE WIDESPREAD

[Nickie Irvine] 19:25:48
we did participate like last year, when we urged you to consider a combined nuisance and mitigation approach, to regulating, beekeeping in Fremont.

[Captioner] 19:25:49
 SUPPORT IN THE
COMMUNITY.
WE

[Captioner] 19:25:52
 DID PARTICIPATE LAST YEAR
WHEN WE URGED YOU

[Captioner] 19:25:55
 TO CONSIDER A
COMBINED NUISANCE AND

[Nickie Irvine] 19:25:57
This has been the major approach throughout bay area in many jurisdictions over the last 10 years, and restrictive regulations, such as the ones in this for proposal have not been the approach that's been used more recently mitigation which is the services of expert

[Captioner] 19:25:58
 MITIGATION
APPROACH TO REGULATING BEE
KEEPING IN FREMONT.


[Captioner] 19:26:02
THIS HAS BEEN THE MAJOR APPROACH


[Captioner] 19:26:06
THROUGHOUT BAY AREA IN MANY
JURISDICTIONS OVER THE LAST 10


[Captioner] 19:26:10
YEARS, AND RESTRICTIVE
REGULATIONS SUCH AS THE

[Captioner] 19:26:13
 ONES IN
THIS PROPOSAL HAVE NOT

[Captioner] 19:26:16
 BEEN THE
APPROACH THAT'S BEEN USED MORE


[Captioner] 19:26:20
RECENTLY.
MITIGATION, WHICH IS THE


[Nickie Irvine] 19:26:21
beekeepers to recess whether nuisance has occurred make it much easier for the city to respond to rare complaints and result in much better outcomes for both, neighbors and big keepers.

[Captioner] 19:26:23
SERVICES OF EXPERT BEE KEEPERS,


[Captioner] 19:26:26
TO ASSESS WHETHER NUISANCE HAS
OCCURRED MAKE IT MUCH

[Captioner] 19:26:30
 EASIER FOR
THE CITY

[Captioner] 19:26:33
 TO RESPOND TO
COMPLAINTS AND RESULT IN MUCH
BETTER

[Captioner] 19:26:36
 OUTCOMES FOR BOTH
NEIGHBORS AND BEE KEEPERS.
I'M

[Captioner] 19:26:39
 NOT SURE WHY COMMUNICATION
SEEMS TO HAVE

[City of Fremont] 19:26:41
Sorry. Thank you. Time is up next

[Captioner] 19:26:43
 BROKEN DOWN.
>> Mayor Mei: SORRY.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:26:48
>> Ms. Gauthier: TIME IS UP.
JOHN HINDS.


[City of Fremont] 19:26:49
Welcome, Mr.

[John Hinds] 19:26:51
Hello! Everyone first. I'd like to thank Staff for the work they did on this, but especially the compilation of how other cities approach suburban agriculture.

[Captioner] 19:26:53
>> Mayor Mei: WELCOME,
MR. HINDS.
>> HELLO, EVERYONE.


[Captioner] 19:26:56
FIRST, I'D LIKE TO THANK STAFF
FOR THE WORK THEY DID ON

[Captioner] 19:26:59
 THIS.
ESPECIALLY THE COMPILATION OF


[John Hinds] 19:27:01
Very helpful. As for the public meeting, I was impressed that you were able to get 53 people on on unusual topic.

[Captioner] 19:27:02
HOW OTHER CITIES APPROACH
SUBURBAN AGRICULTURE.
VERY HELPFUL.


[Captioner] 19:27:05
AS FOR THE PUBLIC MEETING, I WAS
IMPRESSED THAT YOU WERE ABLE TO


[John Hinds] 19:27:08
But maybe you could have got more. I didn't know this meeting was coming, for instance.

[Captioner] 19:27:09
GET 53 PEOPLE ON AN UNUSUAL


[Captioner] 19:27:12
TOPIC, BUT MAYBE YOU COULD HAVE
HAD MORE.
I DIDN'T KNOW THIS MEETING WAS


[John Hinds] 19:27:14
Then the survey, the survey could have been a good way to learn what people think are the appropriate setbacks, and then limits on animals, and we could hear both from people who would like to keep more animals and their neighbors.

[Captioner] 19:27:16
COMING, FOR INSTANCE.
THEN THE SURVEY.


[Captioner] 19:27:19
THE SURVEY COULD HAVE BEEN A
GOOD WAY TO LEARN

[Captioner] 19:27:22
 WHAT PEOPLE
THINK ARE THE APPROPRIATE
SETBACKS AND LIMITS

[Captioner] 19:27:26
 ON ANIMALS,
AND WE COULD HEAR BOTH FROM
PEOPLE

[John Hinds] 19:27:27
In case they see it differently. I can see that some work put into preparing the survey, but we have to discount the results considerably, because with just 58 self chosen respondents It's much harder to know how representative that group is the survey still has value especially those free

[Captioner] 19:27:30
 WHO'D LIKE TO KEEP MORE
ANIMALS AND THEIR NEIGHBORS IN
CASE THEY SEE

[Captioner] 19:27:33
 IT DIFFERENTLY.
I CAN SEE THAT SOME WORK WITH
END

[Captioner] 19:27:36
 UP REPAIRING THE SURVEY, BUT
WE HAVE TO DISCOUNT THE RESULTS


[Captioner] 19:27:40
CONSIDERABLY BECAUSE WITH JUST
58 SELF-CHOSEN

[Captioner] 19:27:43
 RESPONDENTS, IT'S
MUCH HARDER TO KNOW HOW
REPRESENTATIVE THAT GROUP IS.


[John Hinds] 19:27:46
form essays, just less value than I could have had. I have a couple of suggestions for next time around first split the meeting and the survey into 2 independent events.

[Captioner] 19:27:47
THE SURVEY STILL HAS VALUE,
ESPECIALLY THOSE

[Captioner] 19:27:50
 FREEFORM
ESSAYS, JUST LESS VALUE THAN IT
COULD HAVE

[Captioner] 19:27:53
 HAD.
I HAVE A COUPLE OF SUGGESTIONS
FOR NEXT TIME AROUND.


[Captioner] 19:27:57
FIRST, SPLIT THE MEETING AND THE
SURVEY

[John Hinds] 19:27:59
The meeting is more demanding of people's time, and probably drove away.

[Captioner] 19:28:01
 INTO TWO INDEPENDENT
EVENTS.
THE MEETING IS MORE DEMANDING

[John Hinds] 19:28:02
Some people who might have participated in an online survey that was open for a 3 week window or so.

[Captioner] 19:28:04
 OF
PEOPLE'S TIME AND PROBABLY DROVE
AWAY SOME PEOPLE WHO

[Captioner] 19:28:07
 MIGHT HAVE
PARTICIPATED IN AN ONLINE SURVEY
THAT WAS OPEN

[John Hinds] 19:28:08
That might have gotten another 100 people second for every hour that's spent on preparing the survey.

[Captioner] 19:28:10
 FOR A THREE-WEEK
WINDOW OR SO.
THAT MIGHT HAVE GOTTEN

[Captioner] 19:28:14
 ANOTHER
HUNDRED PEOPLE.
SECOND, FOR EVERY HOUR

[John Hinds] 19:28:15
Questions. Consider spending an equal hour on strategizing how to get broader participation.

[Captioner] 19:28:17
 THAT'S
SPENT ON PREPARING THE SURVEY


[Captioner] 19:28:20
QUESTIONS, CONSIDER SPENDING AN
EQUAL HOUR ON

[John Hinds] 19:28:22
The value of the information we get from the survey depends really heavily on that.

[Captioner] 19:28:23
 STRATEGIZING HOW
TO GET BROADER PARTICIPATION.


[Captioner] 19:28:26
THE VALUE OF THE INFORMATION WE
GET FROM

[John Hinds] 19:28:27
Again. Thank you. For the good work. But but this is something to look for next time we do surveys.

[Captioner] 19:28:30
 THE SURVEY DEPENDS
REALLY HEAVILY ON THAT.
AGAIN THANK YOU FOR THE GOOD


[Captioner] 19:28:33
WORK, BUT THIS IS SOMETHING TO
LOOK FOR NEXT TIME WE DO
SURVEYS.


[City of Fremont] 19:28:34

DEVELOPING PROBLEMS THAT COME UP

I think it's a longer discussion that should take place.

[Captioner] 19:29:25
 THE URBAN AND SEMI


[Captioner] 19:29:27
URBAN ENVIRONMENT.
I THINK IT'S A LONGER DISCUSSION
THAT SHOULD TAKE PLACE.


[richard] 19:29:27

THAT I WANTED TO COMMENT ON.
AND

[Captioner] 19:32:26
 THAT ARE THE REQUIREMENTS
THAT BECOME EFFECTIVE


[Steve Skala] 19:32:30
So number one is the lot requirement at 6,000 square feet.

[Captioner] 19:32:31
RESTRICTIONS, ESPECIALLY FOR
CHICKENS.
SO

[Captioner] 19:32:34
 NUMBER ONE IS THE LOT
REQUIREMENT

[Steve Skala] 19:32:35
The that's bigger than my lot, and I have an older lot with the rather large backyard.

[Captioner] 19:32:38
 AT 6,000 SQUARE
FEET.
THAT'S BIGGER THAN

[Captioner] 19:32:42
 MY LOT, AND I
HAVE AN OLDER LOT WITH A RATHER
LARGE

[Steve Skala] 19:32:43
I'll say if I can't have a chicken, or my neighbors can't, You're probably blocking off half of the residents of Fremont and the property line requirement.

[Captioner] 19:32:46
 BACKYARD.
I'D SAY IF I CAN'T HAVE A
CHICKEN OR MY

[Captioner] 19:32:49
 NEIGHBORS CAN'T,
YOU'RE PROBABLY BLOCKING OFF
HALF OF THE

[Captioner] 19:32:52
 RESIDENTS OF
FREMONT.
AND THE

[Steve Skala] 19:32:54
I didn't see that in any other cities most other cities have 20 feet to adjacent dwelling.

[Captioner] 19:32:56
 PROPERTY LINE
REQUIREMENT, I DIDN'T SEE THAT
IN ANY OTHER CITIES.


[Steve Skala] 19:32:59
That's a big difference from 10 feet to property line.

[Captioner] 19:32:59
MOST OTHER CITIES HAVE 20 FEET
TO

[Captioner] 19:33:03
 ADJACENT DWELLING.
THAT'S A BIG DIFFERENCE

[Steve Skala] 19:33:04
from my own experience I've had neighbors with dogs that have been trying to jump the fence couple of years ago.

[Captioner] 19:33:06
 FROM
10 FEET TO PROPERTY LINE.
FROM MY OWN EXPERIENCE, I'VE HAD


[Captioner] 19:33:09
NEIGHBORS WITH DOGS THAT HAVE
BEEN TRYING TO JUMP THE

[Steve Skala] 19:33:11
again. I don't have goats or chickens, but I've been to Arden Wood.

[Captioner] 19:33:14
 FENCE A
COUPLE OF YEARS AGO.
AGAIN, I DON'T HAVE GOAT OR


[Steve Skala] 19:33:15
I could say pretty safely, I would have been happier if they would have had a go to a chicken coming up to the fence.

[Captioner] 19:33:18
CHICKENS BUT I'VE BEEN TO
ARDENWOOD.
I COULD SAY PRETTY SAFELY I


[Steve Skala] 19:33:20
I just don't see a problem or a need for for that level of restriction.

[Captioner] 19:33:21
WOULD HAVE BEEN HAPPIER IF THEY
WOULD HAVE HAD A GOAT OR A


[Captioner] 19:33:24
CHICKEN COMING UP TO THE FENCE.
I JUST DON'T SEE A PROBLEM OR A
NEED FOR THAT

[Steve Skala] 19:33:25
If some kid wants to have a couple of chickens as a project for themselves, I seems like effectively telling them No, and I just think that's that's not the right decision I think you're overly restrictive, and and shall look especially at those 2 property line, limits, and and a

[Captioner] 19:33:27
 LEVEL

[Captioner] 19:33:29
 OF
RESTRICTION.
IF SOME KID WANTS TO HAVE A


[Captioner] 19:33:33
COUPLE CHICKENS AS A PROJECT FOR


[Captioner] 19:33:36
THEMSELVES, IT SEEMS LIKE WE'RE
EFFECTIVELY TELLING THEM

[Captioner] 19:33:38
 NO, AND
I THINK THAT'S NOT THE RIGHT
DECISION.


[Captioner] 19:33:42
I THINK YOU'RE OVERLY
RESTRICTIVE, AND SHOULD

[Captioner] 19:33:45
 LOOK
ESPECIALLY AT THOSE TWO PROPERTY


[Steve Skala] 19:33:47
lot, size limits for for the small number, for the minimum, number of chickens.

[Captioner] 19:33:51
LINE LIMITS AND LOT SIZE LIMITS
FOR THE SMALL NUMBER FOR THE


[Steve Skala] 19:33:52
Probably for goats, too, but I really don't see the need for chickens, so I hope you take a look at that.

[Captioner] 19:33:54
MINIMUM NUMBER OF CHICKENS.
PROBABLY FOR GOATS

[Captioner] 19:33:57
 TOO, BUT I
REALLY DON'T SEE THE NEED FOR
CHICKENS.


[Captioner] 19:34:00
SO I HOPE YOU TAKE A LOOK AT
THAT.
THANK YOU.


[City of Fremont] 19:34:01
Okay, cool. We'll go back to this speaker, the caller with X, the last 3 digits, 4, 8, 9,

[City of Fremont] 19:34:24
Okay, we'll go on to Marie, Marie H.

[Captioner] 19:34:29
WE'LL GO ON TO MARIE.
MARIE H.


[Marie H] 19:34:30
thank you. This is Marie Hughes, longtime resident of Fremont, and someone who wants to own chickens.

[Captioner] 19:34:35
>> THIS IS MARIE HUGHES, LONG
TIME RESIDENT OF

[Marie H] 19:34:39
Unfortunately, my lot right now is too small. So I'm a little jealous of those who can do it.

[Captioner] 19:34:40
 FREMONT, AND
SOMEONE WHO WANTS TO OWN
CHICKENS,

[Marie H] 19:34:44
I read through the entire staff report, and I have 2 comments.

[Captioner] 19:34:44
 UNFORTUNATELY MY LOT
RIGHT NOW IS TOO SMALL, SO I'M A
LITTLE JEALOUS

[Captioner] 19:34:46
 OF THOSE WHO CAN
DO IT.
I READ THROUGH THE ENTIRE STAFF


[Marie H] 19:34:47
First of all, I applaud changing the leash limit to 6 feet from 12, and also I noticed in the staff report, I can continuous reference to the fact that there aren't livestock that's in Fremont, and I feel like this is kind of a chicken and egg.

[Captioner] 19:34:49
REPORT AND I HAVE TWO COMMENTS.
FIRST OF ALL, I

[Captioner] 19:34:53
 APPLAUD CHANGING
THE LEASH LIMIT TO 6 FEET

[Captioner] 19:34:56
 FROM
12, AND ALSO I NOTICED IN THE


[Captioner] 19:35:00
STAFF REPORT A CONTINUOUS
REFERENCE TO THE

[Captioner] 19:35:03
 FACT THAT THERE
AREN'T

[Captioner] 19:35:07
 LIVESTOCK VETS IN
FREMONT, AND I FEEL LIKE THIS IS
KIND OF A

[Marie H] 19:35:08
sort of situation, Where? Well, nobody in Fremont has livestock, so so, if you pass this, these suggestions, and allow people to have goats and chickens, I do believe that we will attract at least one bet who can handle them and so I I urge the council members not to let that

[Captioner] 19:35:10
 CHICKEN AND AN EGG
SORT OF SITUATION WHERE NOBODY


[Captioner] 19:35:13
IN FREMONT HAS LIVESTOCK, SO IF
YOU

[Captioner] 19:35:17
 PASS THESE SUGGESTIONS AND
ALLOW PEOPLE TO

[Captioner] 19:35:20
 HAVE GOATS AND
CHICKENS, I DO BELIEVE THAT WE


[Captioner] 19:35:24
WILL ATTRACT AT LEAST ONE VET
WHO CAN HANDLE THEM.


[Captioner] 19:35:30
SO I URGE THE COUNCILMEMBERS NOT
TO LET THAT DISCOURAGE THEM FROM


[Captioner] 19:35:34
APPROVING THE SUGGESTIONS.
THANK

[City of Fremont] 19:35:36
Thank you. With that, so we'll try the caller again for it.

[Captioner] 19:35:41

>> Ms. Gauthier: WE'LL TRY THE
CALLER

 AGAIN, 489.


[] 19:35:48
let's Hello! My name is Ola Marty.

[] 19:35:50
I am a resident of Fremont, and an attorney.

[Captioner] 19:35:51
>> HELLO, MY NAME IS

[] 19:35:53
Thank you for the updates to the animal ordinance, and giving me an opportunity to see, I did email my full comments to the City Council, given the limited time for public point 0 3 5 goats held on residential property should not be used for food whether dairy or meat no one should

[Captioner] 19:35:55
 ELEHAN
MARTYR, I'M A RESIDENT OF
FREMONT AND AN ATTORNEY.


[Captioner] 19:35:58
THANK YOU FOR THE UPDATES TO THE
ANIMAL ORDINANCE AND GIVING ME
AN OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK.


[Captioner] 19:36:02
I DID EMAIL MY FULL COMMENTS TO
THE CITY COUNCIL GIVEN

[Captioner] 19:36:05
 THE
LIMITED TIME FOR PUBLIC COMMENT.
MY FIRST

[Captioner] 19:36:08
 CONCERN IS

[Captioner] 19:36:12
 SECTION
6.40.035.
GOATS HELD ON RESIDENTIAL


[Captioner] 19:36:15
PROPERTY SHOULD NOT BE USED

[] 19:36:16
be slaughtering goats, that they keep on their residential property, and, secondly, goat milk comes from a lactating mother goat who has had so goats on residential property should not be used for their dairy I mean what happens to the baby how do they be

[Captioner] 19:36:19
 FOR
FOOD, DAIRY OR MEAT.
NOBODY SHOULD BE

[Captioner] 19:36:25
 SLAUGHTERING --
AND GOAT MILK COMES FROM A
LACTATING MOTHER GOAT WHO HAS


[Captioner] 19:36:28
HAD A BABY, SO GOAT ON
RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY SHOULD NOT


[Captioner] 19:36:31
BE USED FOR THEIR DAIRY.
I MEAN, WHAT HAPPENS TO THE

[] 19:36:31
pregnant.

[Captioner] 19:36:33

BABY, HOW DO THEY BECOME
PREGNANT.


[] 19:36:35
Right. I also recommend language on the use of Chicken; food. Again, no one should be slaughtering chicken from a residential property, and I think we should put guard rails as far as eggs produced by hence being used for personal consumption and not a commercial purposes second section 6 point

[Captioner] 19:36:37
SUBSECTION D PROVIDES THAT MALES
NEED TO BE N

[Captioner] 19:36:40
 BE NEUTERED.


[Captioner] 19:36:43
ALSO CHICKENS FOR FOOD, AGAIN NO
ONE SHOULD BE SLAUGHTERING


[Captioner] 19:36:46
CHICKENS ON A RESIDENTIAL
PROPERTY AND I THINK WE SHOULD
PUT

[Captioner] 19:36:50
 GUARDRAILS AS FAR AS EGGS
PRODUCED BY HENS BEING USED FOR


[] 19:36:52
1 0, point 0, 7 0, one shelter and shelter maintenance, meet some clarification A shelter provides to an animal, whereas an enclosure is a spacey animal is confined to and it may not necessarily have shelters so I think this section needs to be divided between

[Captioner] 19:36:53
PERSONAL CONSUMPTION AND NOT FOR
COMMERCIAL PURPOSES.


[Captioner] 19:36:57
SECOND, SECTION ON

[Captioner] 19:36:59
 SHELTER AND
SHELTER MAINTENANCE NEEDS SOME
CLARIFICATION.


[Captioner] 19:37:03
A SHELTER PROVIDES COVER TO AN
ANIMAL, WHEREAS AN

[Captioner] 19:37:05
 ENCLOSURE IS
A SPACE THE ANIMAL IS CONFINED
TO.


[Captioner] 19:37:08
AND IT MAY NOT NECESSARILY HAVE
SHELTER.
SO I THINK THE SECTION

[] 19:37:09
what are shelter? Requirements versus what our enclosure requirements.

[Captioner] 19:37:11
 NEEDS TO
BE DIVIDED BETWEEN WHAT ARE


[] 19:37:14
I'm a currently blended, and it could be clear.

[Captioner] 19:37:14
SHELTER REQUIREMENTS VERSUS WHAT
ARE

[Captioner] 19:37:17
 ENCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS.
IT CURRENTLY BLENDS THEM AND IT
COULD BE

[] 19:37:18
I agree with the shelter requirements, but there needs to be more clarity as to the closure requirements.

[Captioner] 19:37:20
 CLEARER.
I AGREE WITH THE SHELTER
REQUIREMENTS BUT THERE NEEDS TO


[] 19:37:23
For example, an enclosure should be large enough to allow an animal to sit, stand, turn, and also exercise normal behaviors.

[Captioner] 19:37:23
BE MORE CLARITY AS TO THE
ENCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS.


[Captioner] 19:37:26
FOR EXAMPLE, AN ENCLOSURE SHOULD
BE LARGE ENOUGH TO

[Captioner] 19:37:30
 ALLOW AN
ANIMAL TO SIT, STAND, TURN AND


[Captioner] 19:37:33
ALSO EXERCISE NORMAL BEHAVIORS.
I ALSO THINK THERE NEEDS TO

[] 19:37:33
I also think there needs to be more clarity as to how this Shan relates to that enclosure.

[Captioner] 19:37:36
 BE
MORE CLARITY AS TO HOW THIS
SECTION RELATES

[Captioner] 19:37:39
 TO THE ENCLOSURE
REQUIREMENTS FOR CHICKENS AND


[Captioner] 19:37:43
GOATS IN THOSE OTHER SECTIONS.
THANK YOU FOR LISTENING TO MY
COMMENTS.


[City of Fremont] 19:37:44
The next speaker is Diane

[Captioner] 19:37:48
>> Ms. Gauthier: THE NEXT
SPEAKER IS DIANNE.


[Diane] 19:37:52
Hello! Can you hear me? Thank you very much. This is Diane Shaw with Alona Humane Society, and some of the speakers have already brought up some of our concerns But I did want to bring up.

[City of Fremont] 19:37:54
Yes.

[Captioner] 19:37:56
>> HELLO, CAN YOU HEAR ME?
>> Mayor Mei: YES.
>> THANK

[Captioner] 19:37:59
 YOU VERY MUCH.
THIS IS

[Captioner] 19:38:02
 DIANE SHAW WITH OHLONE
HUMANE SOCIETY.


[Diane] 19:38:04
2 things that I haven't heard about haven't heard yet.

[Captioner] 19:38:05
SOME OF THE SPEAKERS HAVE
ALREADY BROUGHT UP SOME OF OUR
CONCERNS BUT I DID WANT

[Diane] 19:38:08
What is around the staying in the shelter for 3 calendar days change from 4 business days. One of the things currently with our current shelter manager.

[Captioner] 19:38:08
 TO BRING
UP TWO THINGS THAT I HADN'T
HEARD ABOUT.


[Captioner] 19:38:11
HAVEN'T HEARD YET.
ONE IS

[Captioner] 19:38:15
 AROUND THE STAYING IN THE
SHELTER FOR THREE CALENDAR DAYS
CHANGED

[Captioner] 19:38:18
 FROM FOUR BUSINESS DAYS.
ONE OF THE THINGS CURRENTLY

[Diane] 19:38:19
I don't think that's any concern. I wouldn't be concerned about that.

[Captioner] 19:38:20
 WITH
OUR CURRENT SHELTER MANAGER, I
DON'T THINK THAT'S ANY CONCERN,


[Diane] 19:38:22
As a policy, however, in the future, if we were to have somebody else, I am concerned, if somebody else is in there that we change that because that's 3 calendar days is a very short time, and there are some people that don't always look to fostering and other organizations.

[Captioner] 19:38:23
I WOULDN'T BE CONCERNED ABOUT
THAT AS

[Captioner] 19:38:26
 A POLICY, HOWEVER, IN
THE FUTURE, IF WE WERE TO HAVE
SOMEBODY

[Captioner] 19:38:29
 ELSE, I AM CONCERNED IF
SOMEBODY ELSE IS IN THERE

[Captioner] 19:38:33
 THAT
WE CHANGE THAT BECAUSE THAT'S --
THREE CALENDAR

[Captioner] 19:38:36
 DAYS IS A VERY
SHORT TIME, AND THERE ARE SOME


[Diane] 19:38:40
To find a place for these animals, or which isn't like.

[Captioner] 19:38:40
PEOPLE THAT DON'T ALWAYS LOOK TO


[Captioner] 19:38:44
FOSTERING IN OTHER ORGANIZATIONS
TO FIND A PLACE FOR THESE
ANIMALS,

[Diane] 19:38:44
I say isn't true, for our current manager, but in the future I'm concerned about putting that in writing.

[Captioner] 19:38:47
 WHICH ISN'T -- LIKE I
SAY, ISN'T TRUE FOR OUR CURRENT
MANAGER, BUT IN

[Diane] 19:38:49
I think that seems like a very short timeframe Secondly, is some of the things the requirements you're putting on animal services and what they're going to have to do to go And inspect these places seems like a lot of them and a lot of work and i'm, concerned.

[Captioner] 19:38:50
 THE FUTURE, I'M
CONCERNED ABOUT PUTTING THAT IN
WRITING, I THINK THAT SEEMS

[Captioner] 19:38:53
 LIKE
A VERY SHORT TIME FRAME.
SECONDLY IS,

[Captioner] 19:38:57
 SOME OF THE
THINGS -- THE REQUIREMENTS
YOU'RE

[Captioner] 19:39:00
 PUTTING ON ANIMAL
SERVICES AND WHAT THEY'RE GOING
TO HAVE TO DO AND GO

[Captioner] 19:39:04
 AND INSPECT
THESE PLACES SEEMS LIKE A LOT

[Diane] 19:39:07
That we already have too much work for the animal services. People.

[Captioner] 19:39:07
 OF
LABOR AND A LOT

[Diane] 19:39:09
We have, and that you will need more staff. Thus the high costs, and so I'm hoping that that can be looked at.

[Captioner] 19:39:11
 OF WORK ABANDONS
I'M CONCERNED THAT WE ALREADY
HAVE TOO MUCH WORK FOR THE


[Captioner] 19:39:14
ANIMAL SERVICES WE HAVE AND YOU
WILL NEED MORE STAFF, THUS THE


[Captioner] 19:39:17
HIGH COST, SO I'M HOPING THAT
THAT CAN BE LOOKED

[Diane] 19:39:18
and then I think, as people have spoke, I think there's just a little bit more work that needs to be done on this.

[Captioner] 19:39:20
 AT.
AND THEN I THINK AS PEOPLE

[Captioner] 19:39:23
 HAVE
SPOKE, I THINK THERE'S JUST A
LITTLE BIT MORE WORK THAT NEEDS


[Diane] 19:39:24
But I think you guys have done a great job, and I I appreciate that you're looking at this and moving forward with it.

[Captioner] 19:39:26
TO BE DONE ON THIS, BUT I THINK
YOU GUYS HAVE DONE

[Captioner] 19:39:30
 A GREAT JOB.
APPRECIATE YOU LOOKING AT THIS
AND

[Captioner] 19:39:33
 MOVING FORWARD WITH IT.
THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 19:39:58
>> Councilmember Cox: THANK YOU.
I REALLY APPRECIATE THE STAFF
WORKING ON THIS NEW

[City of Fremont] 19:40:00
I wanted to find out a little bit more on the animal services that are dedicated for supporting this effort.

[Captioner] 19:40:01
 AMENDMENTS
TO OUR ANIMAL ORDINANCE.
I WANTED

[Captioner] 19:40:04
 TO FIND OUT A LITTLE
BIT MORE ON THE ANIMAL

[Captioner] 19:40:09
 SERVICES
THAT ARE DEDICATED FOR

[Captioner] 19:40:12

SUPPORTING THIS EFFORT.
HOW

[City of Fremont] 19:40:12
how many people actually work in supporting this on a full time basis.

[Captioner] 19:40:15
 MANY PEOPLE ACTUALLY WORK IN
SUPPORTING THIS ON A FULL TIME


[Captioner] 19:40:18
BASIS?


[Kelly Miott] 19:40:21
are you asking about how many staff we had working on this

[City of Fremont] 19:40:26
No, no, no! How many staff are supporting the animal services to be able to carry out this ordinances

[Captioner] 19:40:26
>> ARE YOU ASKING ABOUT HOW MANY
STAFF WE HAVE WORKING ON THIS?


[Captioner] 19:40:31
>> Councilmember Cox: NO, NO,
NO, HOW MANY STAFF ARE
SUPPORTING THE ANIMAL

[Captioner] 19:40:34
 SERVICES
TO BE ABLE TO CARRY OUT THESE
ORDINANCES?


[Kelly Miott] 19:40:34
So we have 4 full time animal services, officers, currently a budgeted with one of those positions only one of those positions currently fill, and then any animal services supervisor to full time administrators and myself

[Captioner] 19:40:37
>> SO WE HAVE FOUR FULL TIME
ANIMAL SERVICES

[Captioner] 19:40:41
 OFFICERS
CURRENTLY BUDGETED.
WITH ONE OF THOSE -- ONLY ONE

[Captioner] 19:40:45
 OF
THOSE POSITIONS CURRENTLY
FILLED, AND THEN ANIMAL

[Captioner] 19:40:49
 SERVICES
SUPERVISOR, TWO FULL-TIME
ADMINISTRATORS AND MYSELF.


[City of Fremont] 19:40:50
Okay, we are in them. We are in the process of filling the vacancies that Kelly just mentioned.

[Kelly Miott] 19:40:52

[Captioner] 19:40:55
>> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.

>> City Mgr. Shackelford: WE ARE
IN THE PROCESS OF FILLING THE


[City of Fremont] 19:40:58
Okay, that are advertised. Yes, Okay, great. I I appreciate that on that update, I think it's really important.

[Captioner] 19:41:01
VACANCIES THAT KELLY JUST
MENTIONED.
>> Councilmember Cox: 

[Captioner] 19:41:04
OKAY,
THEY'RE ADVERTISED, YES.
>> THEY'RE

[Captioner] 19:41:06
 ACTUALLY IN
BACKGROUND.
>> Councilmember Cox: GREAT.


[Captioner] 19:41:09
I APPRECIATE THAT, ON THAT
UPDATE.
I THINK IT'S

[City of Fremont] 19:41:10
another advantage of having goats also, as we've seen, it is health out in the wildfire prevention, as they do a sustainable way of making sure that a lot of the items that are weeds and things growing near our different roadways are keeping it safe for us and

[Captioner] 19:41:14
 REALLY IMPORTANT,
ANOTHER ADVANTAGE OF HAVING


[Captioner] 19:41:17
GOATS ALSO AS WE'VE SEEN IT IS
HELPING OUT IN THE

[Captioner] 19:41:21
 WILDFIRE
PREVENTION AS THEY DO A

[Captioner] 19:41:24


[Captioner] 19:41:27

SUSTAINABLE WAY OF MAKING SURE A
LOT OF THE ITEMS THAT ARE WEEDS


[Captioner] 19:41:30
AND THINGS GROWING NEAR OUR
DIFFERENT ROADWAYS ARE KEEPING
IT SAFE

[City of Fremont] 19:41:32
So I really appreciate some of the focus there on helping out in in terms of the goats, but also allowing it to be as as pets that people can maintain Another part that I thought was really interesting was the amount of there's, a scarcity happening right now with

[Captioner] 19:41:34
 FOR US, AND SO I REALLY
APPRECIATE SOME OF

[Captioner] 19:41:37
 THE FOCUS
THERE ON HELPING OUT IN TERMS

[Captioner] 19:41:40
 OF
THE GOATS BUT ALSO ALLOWING

[Captioner] 19:41:45
 TO
BE -- AS PETS THAT PEOPLE CAN


[Captioner] 19:41:50
MAINTAIN.
ANOTHER PART I THOUGHT WAS
REALLY INTERESTING WAS THE


[Captioner] 19:41:54
AMOUNT OF -- THERE'S A SCARCITY
HAPPENING RIGHT NOW WITH


[City of Fremont] 19:41:54
veterinarian services that there's a lot of different orders throughout the counties.

[Captioner] 19:41:58
VETERINARIAN SERVICES THAT
THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT
ORDERS THROUGHOUT

[City of Fremont] 19:42:00
as I look to being able to maintain the support of keeping the animals healthy, and maintaining all of the as it's called out in the anti rabi shots that are needed even for the dogs, for the updates as some of the new California health and safety codes, but just kind

[Captioner] 19:42:01
 THE COUNTIES.
AS I LOOK TO BEING ABLE

[Captioner] 19:42:04
 TO
MAINTAIN THE SUPPORT OF KEEPING
THE

[Captioner] 19:42:08
 ANIMALS HEALTHY AND
MAINTAINING

[Captioner] 19:42:11
 ALL OF THE -- AS
IT'S CALLED OUT IN

[Captioner] 19:42:15
 THE
ANTIRABIES SHOTS THAT ARE NEEDED
EVEN FOR THE DOGS FOR

[Captioner] 19:42:18
 THE UPDATE
OF SOME OF THE NEW CALIFORNIA
HEALTH AND

[City of Fremont] 19:42:20
of watching that as that progresses, to make sure that we're looking outward to be able to support that.

[Captioner] 19:42:21
 SAFETY CODES, BUT
JUST KIND OF WATCHING THAT

[Captioner] 19:42:25
 AS
THAT PROGRESSES TO MAKE SURE
THAT WE'RE LOOKING OUTWARD TO

[City of Fremont] 19:42:28
but I really appreciate a lot of the hard work that's been put into work with the animals work with.

[Captioner] 19:42:29
 BE
ABLE TO

[Captioner] 19:42:32
 SUPPORT THAT, BUT I
REALLY APPRECIATE A LOT OF THE
HARD WORK THAT'S

[Captioner] 19:42:35
 BEEN PUT INTO


[City of Fremont] 19:42:36
in our community. So some families can be able to appreciate having pets and also supporting healthy moving, as we maintain assistance with animals and in humankind, and being kind to each other, another part that I wanted to raise the question on the animal ordinances is that I I wanted

[Captioner] 19:42:40
WORK WITH -- IN OUR COMMUNITY,
SO SOME FAMILIES CAN BE

[Captioner] 19:42:44
 ABLE TO
APPRECIATE HAVING PETS AND ALSO


[Captioner] 19:42:48
SUPPORTING HEALTHY LIVING

[Captioner] 19:42:51
 AS WE
MAINTAIN EXISTENCE WITH ANIMALS


[Captioner] 19:42:54
AND HUMANKIND AND BEING KIND TO
EACH OTHER.
ANOTHER

[Captioner] 19:42:58
 PART THAT I WANTED TO
RAISE

[City of Fremont] 19:43:01
to find out. I saw quite a few public communications regarding the Alameda beekeepers.

[Captioner] 19:43:04
 THE QUESTION ON THE ANIMALORDINANCE

[Captioner] 19:43:07
 IS, I WANTED TO FIND
OUT, I SAW QUITE A FEW

[City of Fremont] 19:43:09
Were there any members at that meeting? Was it able to identify that?

[Captioner] 19:43:10
 PUBLIC
COMMUNICATIONS ON THE ALAMEDA
BEE KEEPERS.


[Captioner] 19:43:13
WERE THERE ANY MEMBERS AT THAT
MEETING, WAS IT ABLE

[City of Fremont] 19:43:13
Because I saw quite a few written communications, as well as public comments, and being able to understand I didn't really quite grasp all of the the the alignment there with the beekeepers but looking for us to continue this, is a living document this ordinance

[Captioner] 19:43:16
 TO IDENTIFY
THAT BECAUSE I SAW QUITE

[Captioner] 19:43:20
 A FEW
WRITTEN COMMUNICATIONS AS WELL
AS PUBLIC

[Captioner] 19:43:24
 COMMENTS, AND BEING
ABLE

[Captioner] 19:43:27
 TO UNDERSTAND -- I DIDN'T
REALLY QUITE GRASP ALL

[Captioner] 19:43:31
 OF THE
ALIGNMENT THERE WITH THE BEE


[Captioner] 19:43:35
KEEPERS, BUT LOOKING FOR US

[City of Fremont] 19:43:36
and as things come up that will you work together to see how there could be some other things updated as needed.

[Captioner] 19:43:40
 TO
CONTINUE, THIS IS A LIVING
DOCUMENT, THIS ORDINANCE,

[Captioner] 19:43:42
 AND AS
THINGS

[City of Fremont] 19:43:44
So I appreciate. I know this is a a lot of work that's been put into this document, and I appreciate everyone's effort for the city staff to be able to carry that out.

[Captioner] 19:43:46
 COME UP THAT WE'LL WORK
TOGETHER TO SEE HOW THERE COULD
BE SOME OTHER THINGS

[Captioner] 19:43:48
 UPDATED AS
NEEDED.
SO I APPRECIATE -- I KNOW A LOT


[Captioner] 19:43:51
OF WORK HAS BEEN PUT INTO THIS
DOCUMENT, AND I

[Captioner] 19:43:55
 APPRECIATE
EVERYONE'S EFFORT FOR THE CITY
STAFF TO

[City of Fremont] 19:43:55
So I look forward to moving forward with this senses

[Captioner] 19:43:58
 BE ABLE TO CARRY THAT
OUT.
SO I LOOK

[Captioner] 19:44:01
 FORWARD TO MOVING
FORWARD WITH

[Captioner] 19:44:04
 THESE ORDINANCES.


[City of Fremont] 19:44:04
Thank you. Next is Council Member Shell

[City of Fremont] 19:44:09
Thank you, Mana Mayor. As a scientist, I always will come data, and I always will welcome any survey down by the city. Staff.

[Captioner] 19:44:10
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
NEXT IS COUNCILMEMBER SHAO.
>> Councilmember Shao: THANK


[Captioner] 19:44:13
YOU, MADAME MAYOR.


[Captioner] 19:44:17
AS A SCIENTIST, I ALWAYS WELCOME


[Captioner] 19:44:20
DATA, AND HENCE I ALWAYS WELCOME
ANY SURVEY DONE

[Captioner] 19:44:23
 BY THE CITY
STAFF.


[City of Fremont] 19:44:23
Indeed, the sample is arguably small, but it certainly reflects solid things, and I also does some useful information from the data.

[Captioner] 19:44:27
INDEED THE SAMPLE IS ARGUABLY
SMALL, BUT IT

[Captioner] 19:44:30
 CERTAINLY REFLECTS
CERTAIN THINGS

[City of Fremont] 19:44:32
For example, regarding the different kinds of animals, especially for the chicken, that I'll focus on most people who are concerned about chickens are the afraid of the smell and the noise.

[Captioner] 19:44:33
 AND I ALSO FOUND
SOME USEFUL INFORMATION FROM THE
DATA.


[Captioner] 19:44:36
FOR EXAMPLE,

[Captioner] 19:44:39
 REGARDING THE
DIFFERENT KINDS OF ANIMALS,
ESPECIALLY FOR THE

[Captioner] 19:44:43
 CHICKEN THAT
I WILL FOCUS ON, MOST PEOPLE

[Captioner] 19:44:45
 WHO
ARE CONCERNED ABOUT

[Captioner] 19:44:49
 CHICKENS ARE
AFRAID OF THE SMELL AND THE


[City of Fremont] 19:44:51
And that suddenly brings up the issue of the balance of certain people's rights versus other people's rights, doing the pandemic.

[Captioner] 19:44:58
NOISE.
THAT CERTAINLY BRINGS UP THE
ISSUE OF THE BALANCE OF CERTAIN


[Captioner] 19:45:01
PEOPLE'S RIGHTS VERSUS OTHER
PEOPLE'S RIGHTS.
DURING THE

[City of Fremont] 19:45:02
I got a multiple complaints from my constituents regarding certain people raising chickens in the backyard, you know, understandably during the pandemic if you can be self-sufficient by raising chickens, and then and then have eggs, and suddenly that's, good

[Captioner] 19:45:06
 PANDEMIC, I GOT
MULTIPLE COMPLAINTS

[Captioner] 19:45:09
 FROM MY
CONSTITUENTS REGARDING CERTAIN
PEOPLE

[Captioner] 19:45:13
 RAISING CHICKENS IN THE
BACKYARD.


[Captioner] 19:45:16
UNDERSTANDABLY DURING THE
PANDEMIC, IF YOU CAN BE
SELF-SUFFICIENT BY

[Captioner] 19:45:20
 RAISING
CHICKENS AND THEN HAVE EGGS AND
CERTAINLY

[City of Fremont] 19:45:20
thing. But, on the other hand, where the shelter would be placed is a big issue.

[Captioner] 19:45:23
 THAT'S A GOOD THING,
BUT ON THE OTHER

[Captioner] 19:45:27
 HAND, WHERE THE
SHELTER WOULD BE

[City of Fremont] 19:45:28
So, therefore I welcome the new code where there is a certain requirement regarding the shelter away from the property line.

[Captioner] 19:45:30
 PLACED IS A BIG
ISSUE.
SO, THEREFORE,

[Captioner] 19:45:33
 I WELCOME THE NEW


[Captioner] 19:45:36
CODE WHERE THERE'S A CERTAIN
REQUIREMENT

[City of Fremont] 19:45:39
English, complaints. I received, indeed, one in one neighbor just put the shelter right on the fence, even though it's a completely compliant to the code at that time.

[Captioner] 19:45:40
 REGARDING THE
SHELTER AWAY FROM THE

[Captioner] 19:45:43
 PROPERTY
LINE, AND WHILE THE COMPLAINTS I
RECEIVED,

[Captioner] 19:45:46
 INDEED ONE NEIGHBOR
JUST PUT THE

[Captioner] 19:45:51
 SHELTER RIGHT ON
THE FENCE.


[Captioner] 19:45:54
AND EVEN THOUGH IT'S COMPLETELY
COMPLIANT

[City of Fremont] 19:45:55
And then there's nothing the city coding enforcement could do opting inspection, but certainly it calls the new nuisance to the neighbors.

[Captioner] 19:45:58
 TO THE CODE AT THAT
TIME AND THEN THERE'S NOTHING IN


[Captioner] 19:46:01
THE CITY CODE ENFORCEMENT COULD
DO

[Captioner] 19:46:04
 AFTER INSPECTION, BUT
CERTAINLY IT

[City of Fremont] 19:46:06
So. I believe this version already is concerned about that.

[Captioner] 19:46:08
 CAUSES NUISANCE TO
THE NEIGHBORS.
SO I

[Captioner] 19:46:11
 BELIEVE THIS VERSION
ALREADY

[City of Fremont] 19:46:11
And make the necessary mitigating approaches. But even with this current one I still encourage the neighbors when they're exercising their rights.

[Captioner] 19:46:14
 IS CONCERNED ABOUT

[Captioner] 19:46:18
 THAT
AND MAKE THE NECESSARY
MITIGATING

[Captioner] 19:46:22
 APPROACHES, BUT EVEN
WITH THIS CURRENT ONE, I STILL
ENCOURAGE THE

[Captioner] 19:46:26
 NEIGHBORS, WHEN
THEY ARE EXERCISING THEIR
RIGHTS, THEY HAD

[City of Fremont] 19:46:26
They have to be considerate of their the neighbors, just like, you know, you have the right to keep a dog, for example.

[Captioner] 19:46:30
 TO BE CONTRACT
OF THEIR NEIGHBORS

[Captioner] 19:46:34
 JUST LIKE YOU
HAVE THE RIGHT TO KEEP A DOG,
FOR EXAMPLE,

[City of Fremont] 19:46:34
But if the dog keeps barking and night, and then cannot really allow the neighbors to sleep, that that becomes a an issue that so, and it cannot be solved.

[Captioner] 19:46:37
 BUT IF THE DOG
KEEPS BARKING AT NIGHT

[Captioner] 19:46:40
 AND THEN
CANNOT REALLY

[Captioner] 19:46:43
 ALLOW THE
NEIGHBORS TO SLEEP, THAT

[Captioner] 19:46:47
 BECOMES
AN ISSUE, THAT CERTAINLY

[City of Fremont] 19:46:48
You know, with legal approaches, but certainly I still think neighbors should work together, especially in the compassionate city of Fremont.

[Captioner] 19:46:51
 CANNOT
BE SOLVED, YOU KNOW, WITH LEGAL
APPROACHES BUT

[Captioner] 19:46:55
 CERTAINLY I STILL
THINK NEIGHBORS

[Captioner] 19:46:58
 SHOULD WORK
TOGETHER,

[City of Fremont] 19:47:01
We have to really love each other, help each other.

[Captioner] 19:47:02
 ESPECIALLY IN THE
COMPASSIONATE CITY OF FREMONT,
WE HAVE TO

[City of Fremont] 19:47:06
so when you exercise your right to keep all the animals, including the chickens, you have to be considerate of the needs of your neighbors, and try to take every mitigating approach to reduce noise and smell was again in the case of keeping chickens thank you very much

[Captioner] 19:47:09
 REALLY LOVE EACH
OTHER, HELP EACH OTHER, SO WHEN
YOU EXERCISE YOUR RIGHT

[Captioner] 19:47:12
 TO KEEP
ALL THE ANIMALS INCLUDING THE
CHICKENS, YOU HAVE

[Captioner] 19:47:15
 TO BE
CONTRACT OF THE NEEDS OF YOUR


[Captioner] 19:47:18
NEIGHBORS AND TRY TO TAKE EVERY
MITIGATING APPROACH

[Captioner] 19:47:22
 TO REDUCE
NOISE AND SMELL, ONCE

[Captioner] 19:47:25
 AGAIN, IN
THE CASE OF KEEPING CHICKENS.
THANK YOU VERY

[City of Fremont] 19:47:28
Thank you. Next we have Councilmember, Caston. Thank you.

[Captioner] 19:47:31
 MUCH.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
NEXT WE HAVE COUNCILMEMBER


[Captioner] 19:47:34
KASSAN.
>> Councilmember Kassan: THANK
YOU.


[City of Fremont] 19:47:34
I really appreciate the work that was done on this.

[Captioner] 19:47:38
I REALLY APPRECIATE THE WORK
THAT WAS DONE ON THIS.


[City of Fremont] 19:47:39
I just have a few comments. So one I do want to say there was a someone who spoke from the public said: We have no livestock in Fremont, and that is not the case.

[Captioner] 19:47:42
I JUST HAVE A FEW COMMENTS.
SO ONE, I DO WANT

[Captioner] 19:47:45
 TO SAY THERE
WAS SOMEONE WHO SPOKE FROM THE
PUBLIC SAID WE

[Captioner] 19:47:47
 HAVE NO LIVESTOCK
IN FREMONT, AND THAT IS NOT THE
CASE.


[City of Fremont] 19:47:48
We do have quite a bit of livestock in Fremont This ordinance is about livestock on in residentially zoned areas, so it's not such an new thing to have livestock in fremont it's just that we're making hopefully making it a little easier

[Captioner] 19:47:51
WE DO HAVE QUITE A BIT OF
LIVESTOCK IN FREMONT.
THIS

[Captioner] 19:47:54
 ORDINANCE IS ABOUT
LIVESTOCK IN

[Captioner] 19:47:58
 RESIDENTIALLY ZONED
AREAS, SO IT'S NOT

[Captioner] 19:48:01
 SUCH A NEW
THING TO HAVE LIVESTOCK IN
FREMONT, IT'S JUST

[City of Fremont] 19:48:03
for people on residentially zoned properly to have livestock regarding the community outreach process.

[Captioner] 19:48:05
 THAT WE'RE
HOPEFULLY MAKING IT A LITTLE
EASIER FOR PEOPLE

[Captioner] 19:48:07
 ON
RESIDENTIALLY ZONED PROPERTY TO
HAVE LIVESTOCK.


[City of Fremont] 19:48:11
I do have some real concerns about that. First of all, the link to the page about this was broken at some point.

[Captioner] 19:48:12
REGARDING THE COMMUNITY OUTREACH
PROCESS, I DO HAVE SOME

[Captioner] 19:48:15
 REAL
CONCERNS ABOUT

[Captioner] 19:48:21
 THAT.
FIRST OF ALL THE LINK TO THE
PAGE ABOUT THIS WAS BROKEN AT


[City of Fremont] 19:48:21
I got the link to the page, and then a few days later, it was no longer working.

[Captioner] 19:48:24
SOME POINT.
I GOT THE LINK TO THE PAGE AND
THEN A FEW

[Captioner] 19:48:27
 DAYS LATER, IT WAS NO
LONGER WORKING.


[City of Fremont] 19:48:27
Also, I'm I'm really surprised that, given how many people in Fremont are really interested in seeing more urban agriculture happening, You know people who are enthusiastic for bees and and chickens etc.

[Captioner] 19:48:32
ALSO I'M REALLY SURPRISED THAT
GIVEN HOW MANY PEOPLE IN

[Captioner] 19:48:35
 FREMONT
ARE REALLY INTERESTED IN SEEING


[Captioner] 19:48:39
MORE URBAN AGRICULTURE
HAPPENING, PEOPLE WHO

[City of Fremont] 19:48:40
The it doesn't seem like there was much communication with those stakeholders during this 14 month, or fifteen-month process of drafting the the ordinance.

[Captioner] 19:48:42
 ARE
ENTHUSIASTS FOR BEES AND
CHICKENS

[Captioner] 19:48:45
 AND ET CETERA, IT
DOESN'T SEEM LIKE THERE WAS MUCH
COMMUNICATION

[Captioner] 19:48:48
 WITH THOSE
STAKEHOLDERS DURING THIS

[Captioner] 19:48:52

14-MONTH OR 15-MONTH PROCESS OF


[City of Fremont] 19:48:52
I did heal here from quite a few constituents, that they were not all invited to participate in that conversation, and the fact that there was just one community meeting right before it came to council it that really is surprising to me I would think that if we wanted to make sure it was drafted in a way that

[Captioner] 19:48:57
DRAFTING THE ORDINANCE.
I DID HEAR FROM QUITE A

[Captioner] 19:48:59
 FEW
CONSTITUENTS THAT THEY WERE NOT
AT ALL INVITED TO PARTICIPATE IN


[Captioner] 19:49:06
THAT CONVERSATION AND THE FACT
THAT THERE WAS JUST ONE
COMMUNITY MEETING BEFORE IT


[City of Fremont] 19:49:09
really was meeting what the community wanted, obviously balancing interests, that we would have had several communicate like community meetings leading up to the ordinance, all being drafted.

[Captioner] 19:49:10
BECAME TO COUNCIL, THAT REALLY
WAS SURPRISING TO ME.
I WOULD THINK THAT IF

[Captioner] 19:49:13
 WE WANTED
TO MAKE SURE THAT IT WAS DRAFTED
IN A WAY THAT WAS REALLY MEETING


[Captioner] 19:49:16
WHAT THE COMMUNITY WANTED,
OBVIOUSLY BALANCING ALL


[Captioner] 19:49:19
INTERESTS, THAT WE WOULD HAVE
HAD SEVERAL COMMUNITY MEETINGS


[Captioner] 19:49:23
LEADING UP TO THE ORDINANCE
BEING

[City of Fremont] 19:49:23
So that when it was drafted it really reflected what the community wanted, and my understanding, as far as I know, there were no community meetings over the last 14 months.

[Captioner] 19:49:26
 DRAFTED SO THAT WHEN IT
WAS DRAFTED, IT REALLY


[Captioner] 19:49:29
 REFLECTED
WHAT THE COMMUNITY WANTED.
MY UNDERSTANDING, AS FAR AS I


[Captioner] 19:49:32
KNOW, THERE WERE NO COMMUNITY
MEETINGS OVER THE LAST 14
MONTHS.


[City of Fremont] 19:49:33
also I feel like there are a lot of things in the ordinance that are unclear and and really rely on the fact that we do currently have amazing staff in our animal services. Program.

[Captioner] 19:49:36
ALSO I FEEL LIKE THERE ARE A LOT
OF THINGS IN THE ORDINANCE THAT
ARE

[Captioner] 19:49:41
 UNCLEAR, AND REALLY RELY ON
THE

[Captioner] 19:49:45
 FACT THAT WE DO CURRENTLY
HAVE AMAZING STAFF.


[City of Fremont] 19:49:47
I mean, I am so impressed with Kelly, and you know everyone who's working in that department.

[Captioner] 19:49:51
IN OUR ANIMAL SERVICES PROGRAM.
I MEAN, I AM SO IMPRESSED

[Captioner] 19:49:54
 WITH
KELLY AND EVERYONE WHO'S WORKING


[City of Fremont] 19:49:56
However, you know this ordinance. We don't amend ordinances very often, and this ordinance has to be effective, for maybe decades to come, and we we may not always have some amazing.

[Captioner] 19:50:00
IN THAT DEPARTMENT.
HOWEVER, WE DON'T AMEND
ORDINANCES

[Captioner] 19:50:03
 VERY OFTEN.


[Captioner] 19:50:07
AND THIS ORDINANCE HAS TO BE
EFFECTIVE FOR MAYBE DECADES TO
COME, AND WE

[City of Fremont] 19:50:09
Like Kelly running our that department to Diane's Point.

[Captioner] 19:50:10
 MAY NOT ALWAYS HAVE
SOMEONE AMAZING LIKE KELLY
RUNNING

[Captioner] 19:50:14
 THAT DEPARTMENT TO


[City of Fremont] 19:50:15
the 3 days before an animal can be disposed of in one way or another.

[Captioner] 19:50:18
DIANE'S POINT, THE THREE DAYS
BEFORE

[Captioner] 19:50:21
 AN ANIMAL CAN BE DISPOSED
OF IN ONE

[City of Fremont] 19:50:21
Right now we know that there would be so much of an effort to get those animals out to Foster.

[Captioner] 19:50:25
 WAY OR ANOTHER.
RIGHT NOW WE KNOW THERE WOULD BE
SO MUCH OF AN EFFORT TO

[City of Fremont] 19:50:26
But we don't know what could be happening in the future, so I do have a concern about the the switch to the 3 days, and there's a lot of other things that I'm concerned about.

[Captioner] 19:50:28
 GET
THOSE ANIMALS OUT TO FOSTER, BUT
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT COULD BE


[Captioner] 19:50:31
HAPPENING IN THE FUTURE, SO I DO
HAVE A CONCERN ABOUT

[Captioner] 19:50:36
 THE SWITCH
TO THE THREE DAYS.


[City of Fremont] 19:50:37
In the ordinance. I do wanna make sure that people who already have these animals can be grandfathered in.

[Captioner] 19:50:39
AND THERE'S A LOT OF OTHER
THINGS THAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT
IN THE

[Captioner] 19:50:44
 ORDINANCE.
I DO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT
PEOPLE WHO ALREADY HAVE THESE


[City of Fremont] 19:50:46
I understand. That I know the goats situation is kind of unique, but my understanding is that there is a goat structure in Fremont that would have to be torn down if this if the ordinance went into effect.

[Captioner] 19:50:48
ANIMALS CAN BE GRANDFATHERED

[Captioner] 19:50:51
 IN.
I KNOW THE GOAT SITUATION IS
KIND

[Captioner] 19:50:55
 OF UNIQUE, BUT MY
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THERE IS A
GOAT STRUCTURE

[Captioner] 19:50:58
 IN FREMONT THAT
WOULD HAVE TO BE TORN DOWN

[Captioner] 19:51:00
 IF
THIS -- IF THE ORDINANCE WENT
INTO EFFECT THE WAY IT IS NOW


[City of Fremont] 19:51:00
The way. It is now, and it's not bothering anyone, and it's a very beautiful structure that nobody you know, is is very, that is very friendly to the goat.

[Captioner] 19:51:04
AND IT'S NOT BOTHERING ANYONE,
AND IT'S A

[Captioner] 19:51:07
 VERY BEAUTIFUL
STRUCTURE THAT NOBODY, YOU KNOW,
IS

[City of Fremont] 19:51:09
So I would hate to see that happening. So we we do need to see some grandfathering in.

[Captioner] 19:51:11
 VERY -- IS VERY FRIENDLY TO
THE GOATS SO I WOULD HATE TO

[Captioner] 19:51:14
 SEE
THAT HAPPENING, SO WE DO NEED TO
SEE SOME GRANDFATHERING

[City of Fremont] 19:51:14
I agree that that it should be distance from dwelling, not from property line.

[Captioner] 19:51:18
 IN.
I AGREE THAT IT SHOULD BE
DISTANCED FROM

[City of Fremont] 19:51:19
I think the the regulations regarding lot size and property line are too restrictive, and it's also kind of funny, because property side lot size is kind of Oh, it's not a great proxy for how much actual space there is in to keep these animals.

[Captioner] 19:51:21
 DWELLING, NOT
FROM PROPERTY LINE.
I THINK THE REGULATIONS

[Captioner] 19:51:24

REGARDING LOT SIZE AND PROPERTY
LINE ARE TOO

[Captioner] 19:51:30
 RESTRICTIVE, AND
IT'S ALSO KIND OF FUNNY BECAUSE
PROPERTY -- LOT

[Captioner] 19:51:35
 SIZE IS KIND
OF -- IT'S NOT A GREAT

[Captioner] 19:51:38
 PROXY FOR
HOW MUCH ACTUAL SPACE THERE IS
TO KEEP

[City of Fremont] 19:51:38
You might have a very small house, or a very large house, with an adu.

[Captioner] 19:51:41
 THESE ANIMALS.
YOU MIGHT HAVE A VERY SMALL
HOUSE OR A VERY LARGE HOUSE

[City of Fremont] 19:51:43
I know it's hard to base it on. How much open space there is, but lot size is maybe not the best proxy, for where it makes sense to have these animals, and I know many many people who keep chickens on much smaller lot sizes with no problem whatsoever the approach on the bees I think

[Captioner] 19:51:45
 WITH
AN ADU.
I KNOW IT'S

[Captioner] 19:51:49
 HARD TO BASE IT ON
HOW MUCH OPEN SPACE THERE IS BUT
LOT SIZE

[Captioner] 19:51:52
 IS MAYBE NOT THE BEST
PROXY FOR WHERE IT MAKES SENSE
TO HAVE THESE

[Captioner] 19:51:55
 ANIMALS.
AND I KNOW MANY, MANY PEOPLE WHO
KEEP CHICKENS

[Captioner] 19:51:58
 ON MUCH SMALLER
LOT SIZES WITH NO PROBLEM
WHATSOEVER.


[City of Fremont] 19:51:59
isn't, isn't the right approach. There's many, many cities that are using the nuisance-based approach, and there's many activist groups we heard from one representative of one of those groups that has a great track record of making sure bees are don't become, a nuisance and

[Captioner] 19:52:01
THE APPROACH ON THE BEE, I
THINK, ISN'T THE RIGHT APPROACH.


[Captioner] 19:52:05
THERE'S MANY, MANY CITIES THAT
ARE USING THE

[Captioner] 19:52:08
 NUISANCE-BASED
APPROACH AND THERE'S MANY
ACTIVIST

[Captioner] 19:52:11
 GROUPS THAT WE HEARD
FROM ONE REPRESENTATIVE OF ONE
OF THOSE GROUPS THAT

[Captioner] 19:52:15
 HAS A GREAT
TRACK RECORD OF MAKING SURE BEES
DON'T BECOME

[City of Fremont] 19:52:15
address problems that come up. I think the fees are also quite high.

[Captioner] 19:52:18
 A NUISANCE AND
ADDRESS PROBLEMS THAT

[Captioner] 19:52:20
 COME UP.
I THINK THE FEES ARE ALSO QUITE
HIGH.


[City of Fremont] 19:52:21
So these are just some of my concerns, so I would really like to see us.

[Captioner] 19:52:24
SO THESE ARE JUST SOME OF MY
CONCERNS.
SO I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO

[City of Fremont] 19:52:25
not not adopt this tonight and ask Staff to go back and have some some more meetings with our stakeholders in free month as well as people outside of Fremont.

[Captioner] 19:52:30
 SEE US
NOT ADOPT THIS TONIGHT AND ASK
STAFF TO GO BACK AND

[Captioner] 19:52:34

MORE MEETINGS WITH OUR
STAKEHOLDERS IN

Who have a lot of experience with these kinds of issues.

[Captioner] 19:52:38
 FREMONT AS WELL
AS PEOPLE OUTSIDE OF FREMONT WHO
HAVE A LOT OF EXPERIENCE WITH


[City of Fremont] 19:52:39
Thank you. Thank you. Next is Vice Mayor Kang.

[Captioner] 19:52:41
THESE KINDS OF ISSUES.
THANK YOU.


[City of Fremont] 19:52:44
Thank you, Madam Mayor, so I I do want to support urban farming.

[Captioner] 19:52:45
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
NEXT IS VICE MAYOR KENG.
>> Vice Mayor Keng: THANK

[Captioner] 19:52:48
 YOU,
MADAME MAYOR.
SO I DO WANT TO

[City of Fremont] 19:52:50
at the same time we need some balance in the residential area.

[City of Fremont] 19:52:53
So it's a it's good that we're updating our animal ordinance, and I appreciate the staff.

[Captioner] 19:52:54
 SUPPORT OUR
FARMING, AT THE SAME TIME WE
NEED BALANCE IN THE RESIDENTIAL


[Captioner] 19:52:58
AREA SO IT'S GOOD THAT WE'RE
UPDATING OUR ANIMAL

[City of Fremont] 19:53:00
The survey, of what other cities are doing, And I have, I, you know, have also had some feedback from the community, some community community members that had neighbors that have been raising a number of chickens and in some cases cause you know a lot of nuisance when the chicken

[Captioner] 19:53:01
 ORDINANCE,
AND I APPRECIATE THE STAFF DOING


[Captioner] 19:53:05
THE SURVEY OF WHAT OTHER CITIES
ARE

[Captioner] 19:53:08
 DOING.
AND I HAVE ALSO HAD SOME
FEEDBACK FROM

[Captioner] 19:53:12
 THE COMMUNITY,
SOME COMMUNITY MEMBERS THAT HAD


[Captioner] 19:53:15
NEIGHBORS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISING
A NUMBER OF

[City of Fremont] 19:53:19
coop is actually closer to the to the neighbors home instead of the owners of the chickens.

[Captioner] 19:53:20
 CHICKENS AND IN SOME
CASES CAUSE A LOT OF NUISANCE
WHEN THE CHICKEN COOP IS


[Captioner] 19:53:23
ACTUALLY CLOSER TO THE


[City of Fremont] 19:53:25
So I think, having the proposed ordinance, having the appropriate, and, you know, clarification of chicken ownership would help.

[Captioner] 19:53:27
NEIGHBORS' HOME INSTEAD OF THE
OWNERS OF THE CHICKENS.
SO I THINK HAVING

[Captioner] 19:53:30
 THE PROPOSED
ORDINANCE HAVING THE

[Captioner] 19:53:34
 APPROPRIATE
CLARIFICATION OF CHICKEN
OWNERSHIP WOULD

[City of Fremont] 19:53:35
May good Pr. Good practice of good neighbors. Oh, so I I do want to sure that, you know, while we have a shorter leash requirement I would recommend for you know for Fremont to have more dog parks or or dola some of the neighboring cities.

[Captioner] 19:53:38
 HELP MAKE GOOD
PRACTICES OF THE

[Captioner] 19:53:44
 NEIGHBORS.
ALSO I DO WANT TO SHARE THAT
WHILE WE

[Captioner] 19:53:47
 HAVE A

[Captioner] 19:53:51
 SHORTER LEASH
REQUIREMENT, I WOULD RECOMMEND
FOR FREMONT TO

[Captioner] 19:53:54
 HAVE MORE DOG


[City of Fremont] 19:53:54
In the bay area also having these dog off leash areas where it would require less land, as more people are have dongs over the last couple of years over the pandemic in regards to one of the callers concerned.

[Captioner] 19:53:57
PARKS OR SOME OF THE NEIGHBORS
CITIES IN THE BAY AREA ALSO

[Captioner] 19:54:01

HAVING THESE DOG OFF LEASH AREAS


[Captioner] 19:54:04
WHERE IT WOULD REQUIRE LESS LAND
AS MORE

[Captioner] 19:54:08
 PEOPLE ARE -- HAVE DOGS
OVER THE LAST COUPLE YEARS, OVER


[Captioner] 19:54:11
THE PANDEMIC.
IN

[City of Fremont] 19:54:15
About. You know whether goats and chicken could be consume, you know, could be slaughter on site.

[Captioner] 19:54:18
 REGARDS TO ONE OF THE CALLERS
CONCERNED ABOUT WHETHER THE
GOATS

[Captioner] 19:54:21
 AND CHICKEN COULD BE
CONSUMED, YOU

[City of Fremont] 19:54:24
I think we didn't really adjust. Well, I think we did say that it could only be consumed by the owners, so I I do also want to share about the you know, changing the 4 to 3 days when it's kept at our animal shelters and whether you know when we move

[Captioner] 19:54:25
 KNOW, COULD BE
SLAUGHTERED ON

[Captioner] 19:54:28
 SITE, I THINK WE
DIDN'T REALLY ADDRESS -- WELL, I
THINK WE DID SAY

[Captioner] 19:54:31
 THAT IT COULD
ONLY BE CONSUMED BY THE

[Captioner] 19:54:35
 OWNERS.
SO I DO

[Captioner] 19:54:38
 ALSO WANT TO SHARE  ABOUT


[Captioner] 19:54:43
CHANGING THE FOUR TO THREE DAYS
WHEN IT'S KEPT AT OUR

[City of Fremont] 19:54:45
the practice to 3 days. If we are able to make sure that the animals have.

[Captioner] 19:54:46
 ANIMAL
SHELTERS AND WHETHER, WHEN WE
MOVE THE PRACTICE TO THREE DAYS,


[Captioner] 19:54:50
IF WE ARE ABLE TO MAKE

[City of Fremont] 19:54:51
You know we have good efforts to finding homes for the for the animals.

[Captioner] 19:54:53
 SURE THAT
THE ANIMALS HAVE -- WE HAVE GOOD
EFFORTS

[Captioner] 19:54:57
 TO FINDING HOMES FOR THE
ANIMALS.


[City of Fremont] 19:54:57
last question is whether current owners in this case, like current chicken owners, would need to comply to the updated ordinance.

[Captioner] 19:55:00
LAST QUESTION IS WHETHER

[Captioner] 19:55:03
 CURRENT


[Captioner] 19:55:07
OWNERS IN THIS CASE, LIKE
CURRENT CHICKEN OWNERS WOULD
NEED

[City of Fremont] 19:55:09
Thank you.

[Captioner] 19:55:10
 TO COMPLY TO THE UPDATED
ORDINANCE.
THANK

[City of Fremont] 19:55:12
Thank you would stop. Be able to answer any of those questions or comments.

[Captioner] 19:55:13
 YOU.


[Captioner] 19:55:18
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
WOULD STAFF BE ABLE TO ANSWER
ANY OF THOSE QUESTIONS OR


[City of Fremont] 19:55:18
Kelly.

[Captioner] 19:55:21
COMMENTS?
KELLY?


[Kelly Miott] 19:55:22
or chicken owner, compliance, or or current owners, we could definitely put in some provisions for grandfathering and current owners

[Captioner] 19:55:27
>> FOR CHICKEN OWNER COMPLIANCE,


[Captioner] 19:55:30
OUR CURRENT OWNERS, WE COULD
DEFINITELY PUT IN SOME
PROVISIONS

[Captioner] 19:55:34
 FOR GRANDFATHERING IN
CURRENT OWNERS.


[Kelly Miott] 19:55:36
Was there another question

[City of Fremont] 19:55:37
actually I I meant, you know, if the I I'm leaning towards, you know, having the current owners having to comply.

[Captioner] 19:55:39
WAS THERE ANOTHER

[Captioner] 19:55:42
 QUESTION?
>> Vice Mayor Keng: ACTUALLY I
MEANT -- I'M LEANING TOWARDS


[Captioner] 19:55:46
HAVING THE CURRENT OWNERS HAVING


[Kelly Miott] 19:55:47
Okay.

[Captioner] 19:55:48
TO --
>> Mayor Mei: COMPLY, IT SOUNDS
LIKE.


[City of Fremont] 19:55:48
yeah, especially if they're the chicken coop is like, maybe closer to the neighbors home.

[Captioner] 19:55:50
>> Vice Mayor Keng: COMPLY,
YEAH.
ESPECIALLY IF THE CHICKEN COOP


[City of Fremont] 19:55:52
Then their home. So you know, but I think we can have some flexibilities, but it kind of needs to be a case by case.

[Captioner] 19:55:54
IS LIKE MAYBE CLOSER TO THE


[Captioner] 19:55:57
NEIGHBORS' HOME THAN THEIR HOME.
SO I THINK WE CAN HAVE SOME


[City of Fremont] 19:56:00
If there's really complaints. Yeah.

[Captioner] 19:56:01
FLEXIBILITIES, BUT IT KIND OF
NEEDS TO BE CASE BY CASE.


[Kelly Miott] 19:56:01
Absolutely absolutely sorry. I was just referencing whether or not they could own it, but in terms of where the coup would be, I would definitely like to have some ability to enforce, that so that the people that don't want to have chickens or animals up against their fence line could.

[Captioner] 19:56:04
IF THERE'S REALLY COMPLAINTS,
YEAH.
>> ABSOLUTELY.


[Captioner] 19:56:07
SORRY.
I WAS JUST REFERENCING WHETHER
OR NOT THEY COULD OWN IT, BUT IN


[Captioner] 19:56:10
TERMS OF WHERE THE COUP WOULD
BE, I WOULD DEFINITELY LIKE TO


[Captioner] 19:56:14
HAVE SOME ABILITY TO ENFORCE
THAT SO THAT THE

[Captioner] 19:56:17
 PEOPLE THAT
DON'T WANT TO HAVE CHICKENS OR


[Captioner] 19:56:21
ANIMALS UP AGAINST THEIR FENCE
LINE COULD ALSO LIVE WELL IN OUR
CITY.


[City of Fremont] 19:56:21
Great. Thank you so much. Yeah. Thank you. Councilmember Cox.

[Captioner] 19:56:25
>> Vice Mayor Keng: GREAT.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[City of Fremont] 19:56:26
Did you have comments? Because I see we have some couple more from the Council or it's happened before.

[Captioner] 19:56:29
COUNCILMEMBER COX, DID YOU HAVE
COMMENTS?
BECAUSE I SEE WE STILL HAVE

[Captioner] 19:56:31
 A
COUPLE MORE FROM THE COUNCIL.
OR IS THAT FROM BEFORE?


[City of Fremont] 19:56:33
Okay, Thank you. Councilmember Saw one

[Captioner] 19:56:35
>> Councilmember Cox: THAT'S
FROM BEFORE.
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY, THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:56:38
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN.


[City of Fremont] 19:56:38
Yeah, wanted to see

[City of Fremont] 19:56:44
Okay, here we are just wanted to see Staff's perspective on.

[Captioner] 19:56:45
>> Councilmember Salwan: THANK
YOU, MADAME MAYOR.
I JUST WANTED TO SEE --

[Captioner] 19:56:48
 OKAY.
HERE WE ARE.
JUST

[City of Fremont] 19:56:49
There was a mention of no chickens. If the lot was less than 6,000 square feet.

[Captioner] 19:56:51
 WANTED TO SEE STAFF'S
PERSPECTIVE ON -- THERE WAS A
MENTION

[Captioner] 19:56:54
 OF NO CHICKENS IF THE
LOT WAS LESS

[City of Fremont] 19:56:56
Is Is there some leeway there? What's the thinking as far as Why, chickens are not allowed?

[Captioner] 19:56:57
 THAN 6,000 SQUARE
FEET.
IS

[Captioner] 19:57:01
 THERE SOME LEEWAY THERE?
WHAT'S THE THINKING AS FAR

[City of Fremont] 19:57:01
If the lot is less than 6,000

[Captioner] 19:57:03
 AS
WHY CHICKENS ARE NOT ALLOWED IF
THE LOT IS LESS THAN 6,000?


[Kelly Miott] 19:57:06
the that first for starters. We put the square footage in, because it's the best metric the city has to define the lot space, and it's also been the historical standard.

[Captioner] 19:57:11
>> THAT FIRST -- FOR STARTERS,
WE PUT THE SQUARE

[Captioner] 19:57:15
 FOOTAGE IN
BECAUSE IT'S THE BEST METRIC THE
CITY HAS

[Captioner] 19:57:18
 TO DEFINE THE LOT
SPACE.


[Captioner] 19:57:21
AND IT ALSO BEEN THE HISTORICAL
STANDARD THE CITY HAS USED FOR
ANIMAL

[City of Fremont] 19:57:23
Okay. And then there was mention about some discrepancy between the Alameda County beekeepers and what we're proposing.

[Captioner] 19:57:24
 ORDINANCES.
>> Councilmember Salwan: OKAY.


[Captioner] 19:57:29
AND THEN THERE WAS MENTION ABOUT
SOME DISCREPANCY BETWEEN

[Captioner] 19:57:32
 THE
ALAMEDA COUNTY BEE KEEPERS AND


[City of Fremont] 19:57:33
I couldn't really figure out the difference. What?

[Captioner] 19:57:35
WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING.
I CAN

[City of Fremont] 19:57:36
What are they looking for, and what how is that different?

[Captioner] 19:57:39
 CAN'T REALLY FIGURE OUT THE
DIFFERENCE.
WHAT ARE THEY

[City of Fremont] 19:57:39
What we have now

[Kelly Miott] 19:57:40
in general, the the main concern and I hope I'm not misrepresenting them is that they want our be high enforcement to be more new sense based and less per requiring permits and having lot sizes

[Captioner] 19:57:41
 LOOKING FOR AND
HOW IS THAT DIFFERENT FROM WHAT
WE HAVE NOW?


[Captioner] 19:57:44
>> IN GENERAL, THE MAIN CONCERN,
AND I HOPE

[Captioner] 19:57:48
 I'M NOT
MISREPRESENTING THEM, IS THAT
THEY WANT OUR

[Captioner] 19:57:51
 BEEHIVE
ENFORCEMENT TO BE MORE
NUISANCE-BASED

[Captioner] 19:57:54
 AND LESS
REQUIRING PERMITS.
AND HAVING LOT

[Captioner] 19:57:57
 SIZES.
>> Councilmember Salwan:NUISANC


[City of Fremont] 19:57:57
nuisance based meaning what complaint driven?

[Kelly Miott] 19:58:00
Yes.

[Captioner] 19:58:01
E-BASED MEANING WHAT,
COMPLAINT-DRIVEN OR --
>> YES.


[City of Fremont] 19:58:01
Or okay, So you can do what you want. If there's a complaint, then enforcement comes.

[Captioner] 19:58:05
>> Councilmember Salwan: OKAY.
SO YOU CAN DO WHAT YOU WANT, IF
THERE'S A

[City of Fremont] 19:58:06
Is that what in kind of a simple version, what they're looking they're trying to stay.

[Captioner] 19:58:08
 COMPLAINT, THEN
ENFORCEMENT COMES.
IS THAT

[Captioner] 19:58:11
 WHAT -- IN KIND OF A
SIMPLE VERSION WHAT THEY'RE
TRYING

[City of Fremont] 19:58:11
Okay, Okay, Okay, Thank you. And I think we must have had the at least 3 or 4 of us that got contacted by the same person about that.

[Captioner] 19:58:14
 TO STATE?
>> YES, YES.
>> Councilmember Salwan: OKAY.


[Captioner] 19:58:17
THANK YOU.
AND I THINK WE MUST HAVE HAD
THE --

[Captioner] 19:58:20
 AT LEAST THREE OR FOUR OF
US THAT GOT CONTACTED BY THE


[City of Fremont] 19:58:21
Chicken cube being right next to his house, and it was very far from the current residents.

[Captioner] 19:58:23
SAME PERSON ABOUT THE CHICKEN
COOP BEING RIGHT NEXT TO HIS


[Captioner] 19:58:27
HOUSE, AND IT WAS VERY FAR FROM


[City of Fremont] 19:58:27
The residents house, but it's very close to the the neighbors, so I can see how if there's lots of chickens that the odor can be be a concern Good!

[Captioner] 19:58:30
THE CURRENT -- THE

[Captioner] 19:58:33
 RESIDENT'S
HOUSE BUT IS VERY CLOSE TO THE
NEIGHBOR'S, SO I CAN SEE

[Captioner] 19:58:36
 HOW IF
THERE'S LOTS OF CHICKENS, THE
ODOR CAN

[City of Fremont] 19:58:38
Well, this is not a perfect document. And you know, I think Council Member Cox mentioned, This is a living document.

[Captioner] 19:58:39
 BE A CONCERN.
OKAY.
WELL, THIS IS

[Captioner] 19:58:42
 NOT A PERFECT
DOCUMENT.
I THINK COUNCILMEMBER COX


[City of Fremont] 19:58:44
It's a work in progress. And so I think there are some good changes here that I can get behind, and we can always revisit anything that needs to be expanded upon in the future.

[Captioner] 19:58:45
MENTIONED, THIS IS A LIVING
DOCUMENT, IT'S A WORK IN
PROGRESS.


[Captioner] 19:58:49
AND SO I THINK THERE ARE SOME
GOOD CHANGES HERE THAT I CAN

[Captioner] 19:58:52
 GET
BEHIND.
AND WE CAN ALWAYS REVISIT


[City of Fremont] 19:58:54
I do want to thank Staff for your diligent work and getting community feedback.

[Captioner] 19:58:55
ANYTHING THAT NEEDS TO BE
EXPANDED UPON IN THE FUTURE.
I DO WANT

[Captioner] 19:58:58
 TO THANK STAFF FOR
YOUR DILIGENT WORK, AND

[City of Fremont] 19:58:59
I think this is a good process, and I think Staff has done their level best to.

[Captioner] 19:59:01
 GETTING
COMMUNITY FEEDBACK.
I THINK THIS IS A GOOD PROCESS


[Captioner] 19:59:04
AND I THINK STAFF HAS DONE THEIR
LEVEL BEST

[City of Fremont] 19:59:04
I guess this far. Thank you

[City of Fremont] 19:59:07
Thank you. I I wanted to add some comments to him, or some quick questions, just because these days there's so many also challenges with allergies, and I know that there are people who are also allergic, to bees themselves.

[Captioner] 19:59:08
 TO GET US THIS FAR.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:59:11
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
I WANTED TO ADD SOME

[Captioner] 19:59:14
 COMMENTS
TOO OR SOME QUICK QUESTIONS.
JUST BECAUSE THESE DAYS, THERE'S


[Captioner] 19:59:18
SO MANY ALSO CHALLENGES WITH
ALLERGY, AND I KNOW THAT THERE
ARE

[Captioner] 19:59:22
 PEOPLE WHO ARE ALSO ALLERGIC
TO BEES THEMSELVES,

[City of Fremont] 19:59:22
And so I was wondering was that something that was also looked at in terms of I know that the beekeepers will be keeping the bees, but in just in terms of any other was there any comments on that area

[Captioner] 19:59:25
 AND SO I WAS
WONDERING, WAS THAT SOMETHING
THAT WAS ALSO

[Captioner] 19:59:28
 LOOKED AT IN TERMS
OF -- I KNOW THAT THE BEE
KEEPERS

[Captioner] 19:59:31
 WILL BE KEEPING THE BEES
BUT JUST IN TERMS

[Captioner] 19:59:34
 OF -- WAS
THERE ANY COMMENTS ON THAT AREA?


[Kelly Miott] 19:59:34
there was not public feedback on that. But I will let you know that some cities do require people who are interested in having beehives to get approval from their neighbors, and confirm whether or not their neighbors have the allergies but this was not something that was brought up.

[Captioner] 19:59:38
>> THERE WAS NOT PUBLIC FEEDBACK
ON THAT, BUT I WILL LET YOU KNOW


[Captioner] 19:59:41
THAT SOME CITIES DO REQUIRE


[Captioner] 19:59:45
PEOPLE WHO ARE INTERESTED IN
HAVING BEE HIVES TO GET

[Captioner] 19:59:48
 APPROVAL
FROM THEIR NEIGHBORS AND CONFIRM
WHETHER OR NOT THEIR

[Captioner] 19:59:52
 NEIGHBORS
HAVE BEE ALLERGIES, BUT THIS WAS
NOT SOMETHING THAT WAS BROUGHT


[Captioner] 19:59:55
UP DURING OUR ENGAGEMENT.
>> Mayor Mei: 

[City of Fremont] 19:59:55
I was just curious, because I know that having been involved previously with education schools, like because of the peanut allergies, and things, and the fact that you're trying to respect everyone's needs and concerns and health, that you know when it comes to that there's sometimes like literally I guess

[Captioner] 19:59:59
I WAS JUST CURIOUS
BECAUSE I KNOW THAT HAVING BEEN
INVOLVED PREVIOUSLY

[Captioner] 20:00:02
 WITH
EDUCATION IN SCHOOLS, BECAUSE OF
THE PEANUT ALLERGIES AND THINGS


[Captioner] 20:00:06
AND THE FACT THAT YOU'RE TRYING
TO RESPECT EVERYONE'S

[Captioner] 20:00:09
 NEEDS AND
CONCERNS AND HEALTH, THAT, YOU
KNOW, WHEN IT COMES TO THAT,


[City of Fremont] 20:00:10
peanut free tables that they have in the cafeteria or peanut butter, free areas.

[Captioner] 20:00:12
THERE'S SOMETIMES LIKE
LITERALLY, I GUESS, PEANUT-FREE


[Captioner] 20:00:15
TABLES THAT THEY HAVE IN THE
CAFETERIA OR

[City of Fremont] 20:00:15
So that's why I just wondering about that question about the Allergies, because some people it could be very Ted deadly and toxic too.

[Captioner] 20:00:18
 PEANUT BUTTER-FREE
AREAS, SO THAT'S WHY I WAS


[Captioner] 20:00:22
WONDERING ABOUT THAT QUESTION
ABOUT THE

[City of Fremont] 20:00:22
So that's why I just wanted to be of that process.

[Captioner] 20:00:25
 ALLERGIES, BECAUSE
SOME PEOPLE IT COULD BE VERY
DEADLY AND

[City of Fremont] 20:00:26
I will say that I have to differ a little bit to one of my council members, because he spends a lot of time with some of these animals, so I don't think these are his specific ones.

[Captioner] 20:00:29
 TOXIC TO SO I WANTED
TO BE THOUGHTFUL ABOUT THAT


[Captioner] 20:00:32
PROCESS.
I WILL SAY I HAVE TO DEFER ONE
OF MY

[Captioner] 20:00:35
 COUNCILMEMBERS BECAUSE HE
SPENDS A LOT OF TIME WITH THESE
ANIMALS BUT I

[City of Fremont] 20:00:35
That he it treats. And I think that there is up opportunities Certainly we don't have of the that same type of veterinary program locally, at least not for farm animals.

[Captioner] 20:00:37
 DON'T THINK THESE
ARE HIS SPECIFIC ONES THAT HE
TREATS.


[Captioner] 20:00:40
AND I THINK THAT THERE IS
OPPORTUNITY CERTAINLY, WE

[Captioner] 20:00:44
 DON'T
HAVE THAT SAME TYPE OF
VETERINARY PROGRAM LOCALLY,

[City of Fremont] 20:00:45
But I would encourage us to continue to work with the different organizations that have spoken this evening.

[Captioner] 20:00:47
 AT
LEAST, NOT FOR FARM ANIMALS.
BUT I WOULD ENCOURAGE

[Captioner] 20:00:50
 US TO
CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE
DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS THAT


[City of Fremont] 20:00:50
I know that some of them have spoken in the past in particular, during our Earth day partnerships with Washington Hospital we've had certain representations, and certainly with different organizations Here, in Alameda county we're fortunate to have that partnership and so i'd like to continue

[Captioner] 20:00:53
HAVE SPOKEN THIS EVENING.
I KNOW THAT SOME OF THEM HAVE
SPOKEN IN THE

[Captioner] 20:00:56
 PAST, IN
PARTICULAR, DURING OUR EARTH DAY
PARTNERSHIPS

[Captioner] 20:01:00
 WITH WASHINGTON
HOSPITAL, WE'VE HAD CERTAIN
REPRESENTATIONS AND

[Captioner] 20:01:04
 CERTAINLY
WITH DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS
HERE IN ALAMEDA

[Captioner] 20:01:06
 COUNTY, WE'RE
FORTUNATE TO HAVE THAT
PARTNERSHIP, SO I'D LIKE TO


[City of Fremont] 20:01:06
that type of support and working to drive these ordinances, I would concur with Councilmember, Salin and Council Member Cox, that this is a living document, and hopefully something that I I would like to see That's not something that We'd have to wait decades to be able to

[Captioner] 20:01:10
CONTINUE THAT TYPE

[Captioner] 20:01:14
 OF SUPPORT IN
WORKING TO DRIVE THESE
ORDINANCES.


[Captioner] 20:01:18
I WOULD CONCUR WITH
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN AND
COUNCILMEMBER COX THAT THIS IS A


[Captioner] 20:01:21
LIVING DOCUMENT AND HOPEFULLY
SOMETHING THAT I WOULD LIKE TO


[City of Fremont] 20:01:23
evaluate That something that we should be able to evaluate as needed.

[Captioner] 20:01:24
SEE, IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT
WE'D HAVE TO WAIT DECADES TO BE
ABLE

[City of Fremont] 20:01:26
But I think also at the same time, and and respect. I think that there was some questions from the public, and I know Council Member Cassin had put this agenda item out for referral.

[Captioner] 20:01:28
 TO EVALUATE, WE SHOULD BE
ABLE TO RE-EVALUATE AS NEEDED,
BUT

[Captioner] 20:01:31
 I THINK ALSO AT THE SAME
TIME, IN RESPECT, I THINK THAT
THERE WAS SOME QUESTIONS FROM


[Captioner] 20:01:34
THE PUBLIC, AND I KNOW
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN HAD PUT

>> Mayor Mei: THAT WOULD BE NICE
TO KNOW, BECAUSE WE DO WANT TO


[Captioner] 20:03:03
HAVE A REASONABLE TIME FRAME

>> Councilmember Kassan: 

[City of Fremont] 20:03:05
If you were at the community meeting and anyone who gave comments.

[Captioner] 20:03:06
SO
THERE HASN'T REALLY BEEN MUCH
OUTREACH IF YOU WERE AT

[City of Fremont] 20:03:08
They were told to just put their comments in the survey. And the survey.

[Captioner] 20:03:10
 THE
COMMUNITY MEETING, AND ANYONE
WHO GAVE

[Captioner] 20:03:13
 COMMENTS, THEY WERE
TOLD TO JUST PUT THEIR COMMENTS
IN THE SURVEY AND

[City of Fremont] 20:03:13
You know, we just got the results. So I I would like to see some community meetings done where there's a meaningful opportunity for stakeholders on this issue to give feedback that could actually influence the how the ordinance is drafted instead of just saying Well, here's the ordinance if you

[Captioner] 20:03:15
 THE SURVEY,
YOU KNOW, WE JUST GOT THE
RESULTS.


[Captioner] 20:03:18
SO I WOULD LIKE TO SEE SOME
COMMUNITY MEETINGS

[Captioner] 20:03:21
 DONE WHERE
THERE'S A MEANINGFUL OPPORTUNITY
FOR STAKEHOLDERS ON

[Captioner] 20:03:25
 THIS ISSUE
TO GIVE FEEDBACK THAT COULD


[Captioner] 20:03:29
ACTUALLY INFLUENCE HOW THE
ORDINANCE IS DRAFTED INSTEAD OF
JUST

[City of Fremont] 20:03:30
have comments on it. Please submit that I I see also Councilmember Jones.

[Captioner] 20:03:32
 SAYING, WELL, HERE'S THE
ORDINANCE IF YOU HAVE COMMENTS
ON IT, PLEASE

[Captioner] 20:03:35
 SUBMIT THEM.
>> Mayor Mei: I SEE ALSO


[City of Fremont] 20:03:35
Did you I'll also press the button. Yeah, just a quick question.

[Captioner] 20:03:38
COUNCILMEMBER JONES, DID YOU
ALSO PRESS THE BUTTON TOO?
>> Councilmember Jones: 

[City of Fremont] 20:03:38
And maybe Kelly knows. Maybe she doesn't. How many people were we talking about that actually own goats, chicken, or bees?

[Captioner] 20:03:41
JUST A
QUICK QUESTION, AND MAYBE KELLY
KNOWS, MAYBE SHE DOESN'T.


[Captioner] 20:03:45
HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE WE TALKING
ABOUT THAT ACTUALLY OWN GOATS,


[City of Fremont] 20:03:45
I think she mentioned that presentation. But, Kelly, would you like to

[Captioner] 20:03:48
CHICKENS OR BEES?
>> Mayor Mei: I THINK SHE
MENTIONED THAT IN THE


[Kelly Miott] 20:03:50
yes, so since to the year 2,000, the city has issued 5 permits for goat ownership to 4 unique residents. For beehives, we have 5 current beehive permits since the year.

[Captioner] 20:03:51
PRESENTATION, BUT KELLY, WOULD
YOU LIKE TO --
>> YES.


[Captioner] 20:03:55
SO SINCE THE YEAR 2000, THE CITY
HAS

[Captioner] 20:03:59
 ISSUED FIVE PERMITS FOR GOAT
OWNERSHIP

[Captioner] 20:04:03
 TO FOUR UNIQUE
RESIDENTS.
FOR BEE HIVES, WE

[Kelly Miott] 20:04:05
2,000 The city has issued 29 permanent for beehive ownership to 27 unique residents.

[Captioner] 20:04:06
 HAVE FIVE
CURRENT BEEHIVE PERMITS.
SINCE THE YEAR 2000, THE CITY


[Captioner] 20:04:10
HAS ISSUED 29 PERMITS FOR
BEEHIVE

[Captioner] 20:04:13
 OWNERSHIP TO 27 UNIQUE
RESIDENTS.
WE

[Captioner] 20:04:16
 HAVE CURRENTLY FOUR CHICKEN
PERMITS, AND SINCE THE

[Captioner] 20:04:20
 YEAR
2000, THE CITY HAS ISSUED 46
PERMITS

[Captioner] 20:04:24
 FOR CHICKEN OWNERSHIP TO
40 UNIQUE

[Captioner] 20:04:27
 RESIDENTS.


[City of Fremont] 20:04:27
Okay. So essentially, we have right around 40 to 43, something like that.

[Captioner] 20:04:31
>> Councilmember Jones: SO
ESSENTIALLY WE HAVE RIGHT

[Captioner] 20:04:34
 AROUND
40 TO 43, SOMETHING LIKE THAT,
TOTAL

[City of Fremont] 20:04:34
Total households? Is that correct? 41, 41 little faster on the map?

[Captioner] 20:04:38
 HOUSEHOLDS, IS THAT
CORRECT?
>> Councilmember Cox: 

[Captioner] 20:04:42
41.
>> Councilmember Jones: 

[City of Fremont] 20:04:42
Well, they could be duplicates. I know some of the ones that spoke in the past at both animals, multiple animals, so it doesn't mean they're totally so much my point being the outreach the community meeting that we had had I believe Kelly said 53.

[Captioner] 20:04:45
41?
A LITTLE FASTER ON THE MAP.
>> Mayor Mei: THEY

[Captioner] 20:04:48
 COULD BE
DUPLICATES.
I KNOW PEOPLE THAT

[Captioner] 20:04:52
 SPOKE IN THE
PAST HAD BOTH ANIMALS, MULTIPLE


[Captioner] 20:04:54
ANIMALS.
>> Councilmember Jones: THE
COMMUNITY MEETING WE HAD, I


[City of Fremont] 20:04:55
Attendees, and if we have 41, interested by parties or affected parties, I I do think that's probably you know, the the only outreach you're gonna get.

[Captioner] 20:04:58
BELIEVE KELLY SAID 53 ATTENDEES,
AND IF WE

[Captioner] 20:05:02
 HAVE 41 INTERESTED
PARTIES OR AFFECTED PARTY,

[Captioner] 20:05:05
 I DO
THINK THAT'S PROBABLY, YOU

[Captioner] 20:05:07
 KNOW,
THE ONLY OUTREACH YOU'RE GOING
TO GET.


[City of Fremont] 20:05:07
I mean, if if people don't have these types of situations, then they are probably not going to attend that meeting, because it doesn't really affect them.

[Captioner] 20:05:10
I MEAN, IF PEOPLE DON'T HAVE
THESE TYPES OF

[Captioner] 20:05:13
 SITUATIONS, THEN
THEY ARE PROBABLY NOT GOING TO
ATTEND THAT MEETING BECAUSE

[City of Fremont] 20:05:14
So it does seem like there was some outreach to get that done.

[Captioner] 20:05:16
 IT
DOESN'T REALLY AFFECT THEM.
SO IT DOES SEEM LIKE THERE WAS


[City of Fremont] 20:05:18
That's my only comment

[Captioner] 20:05:19
SOME OUTREACH TO GET THAT DONE.
THAT'S MY ONLY

[City of Fremont] 20:05:21
Thank you. I think we have a motion a second. I see some other hands, because somebody had asked clarification.

[Captioner] 20:05:25
 COMMENT.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
I THINK WE HAVE A MOTION AND A


[City of Fremont] 20:05:27
I don't know. My only other question would be to Staff in terms of if we were to do more outreach.

[Captioner] 20:05:29
SECOND.
I SEE SOME OTHER HANDS BECAUSE
SOMEBODY HAD ASKED FOR


[Captioner] 20:05:31
CLARIFICATION.
MY ONLY OTHER QUESTION WOULD BE
TO STAFF IN TERMS OF IF WE WERE


[City of Fremont] 20:05:32
What's the bandwidth? I mean? That was the question that came up originally is even with the ordinance, How much staff support do we need?

[Captioner] 20:05:35
TO DO MORE OUTREACH, WHAT'S THE
BANDWIDTH?
THAT WAS THE QUESTION THAT

[Captioner] 20:05:38
 CAME
UP ORIGINALLY, IS EVEN WITH THE
ORDINANCE, HOW MUCH STAFF


[City of Fremont] 20:05:38
And if we were gonna do additional meetings, this is something, and I would defer to the city manager or to Kelly on that comment

[Captioner] 20:05:41
SUPPORT DO WE NEED, AND IF WE
WERE GOING TO DO ADDITIONAL


[Captioner] 20:05:45
MEETINGS, IS THIS SOMETHING --
AND I WOULD DEFER TO THE CITY
MANAGER OR TO KELLY ON

[Captioner] 20:05:48
 THAT
COMMENT.


[City of Fremont] 20:05:51
Hey, Kelly, go ahead and offer your response.

[Captioner] 20:05:55
>> City Mgr. Shackelford: KELLY,
GO AHEAD AND OFFER YOUR
RESPONSE.


[Kelly Miott] 20:05:55
I'm sorry I didn't hear you

[City of Fremont] 20:05:56
Oh, I was asking so my biggest concern here. Besides, the a question about additional outreach is, what type of capacity would that take for our staff to be able to go out for additional outreach

[Captioner] 20:05:58
>> I'M SORRY, I DIDN'T HEAR YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: OH.
I WAS

[Captioner] 20:06:01
 ASKING, SO MY BIGGEST
CONCERN HERE

[Captioner] 20:06:05
 BESIDES THE
QUESTION  ADDITIONAL OUTREACH IS
WHAT TYPE OF CAPACITY WOULD THAT


[Captioner] 20:06:08
TAKE FOR OUR STAFF TO BE ABLE TO
GO OUT FOR ADDITIONAL

[Kelly Miott] 20:06:09
I'm willing to take direction from Council if you would like me to provide more outreach.

[Captioner] 20:06:11
 OUTREACH?
>> I'M WILLING TO TAKE DIRECTION


[Captioner] 20:06:14
FROM COUNCIL.
IF YOU WOULD LIKE ME TO PROVIDE
MORE OUTREACH.


[Captioner] 20:06:19
OUR STAFFING IS A CHALLENGE
RIGHT NOW.
BUT

[Captioner] 20:06:22
 I'M WILLING TO DO WHATEVER
IT TAKES TO GET THIS TO THE
POINT WHERE IT

[Captioner] 20:06:26
 IS A GOOD
ORDINANCE FOR OUR COMMUNITY.


[City of Fremont] 20:06:26
And so I guess I would ask, is that one more community meeting, 5 more community meetings?

[Captioner] 20:06:29
>> City Mgr. Shackelford: SO I
GUESS I WOULD ASK, IS

[Captioner] 20:06:32
 THAT ONE
MORE COMMUNITY MEETING, FIVE
MORE COMMUNITY

[City of Fremont] 20:06:34
What what would be satisfactory?

[Captioner] 20:06:38
 MEETINGS?
WHAT WOULD BE SATISFACTORY?


[Captioner] 20:06:43
>> Councilmember Kassan: I DON'T
THINK IT ABOUT A NUMBER.
I THINK THE

[City of Fremont] 20:06:44
I don't think it's about a number.

[City of Fremont] 20:06:44
I think the situation the current situation is there doesn't seem to have been outreach in drafting the ordinance to the stakeholders, and I want to differ with Councilmember Jones that only 40 people are affected because this ordinance First, of all it affects everyone who

[Captioner] 20:06:47
 CURRENT SITUATION IS
THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE BEEN


[Captioner] 20:06:50
OUTREACH IN DRAFTING THE
ORDINANCE TO THE

[Captioner] 20:06:53
 STAKEHOLDERS,
AND I WANT TO DEFER WITH
COUNCILMEMBER JONES

[Captioner] 20:06:57
 DIFFER WITH
COUNCILMEMBER JONES THAT ONLY 40
PEOPLE

[City of Fremont] 20:06:57
cares about animals, especially when we're talking about the disposition period of 3 days versus 4 business days.

[Captioner] 20:07:00
 ARE AFFECTED BECAUSE
FIRST OF ALL, IT AFFECTS
EVERYONE WHO CARES ABOUT


[Captioner] 20:07:03
ANIMALS, ESPECIALLY WHEN WE'RE
TALKING ABOUT THE DISPOSITION
PERIOD OF THREE DAYS

[City of Fremont] 20:07:04
Also there are many, many people who would like to have chickens or other animals, but cannot, currently because of our current ordinance.

[Captioner] 20:07:06
 VERSUS FOUR
BUSINESS DAYS.
ALSO THERE ARE MANY, MANY PEOPLE


[Captioner] 20:07:09
WHO WOULD LIKE TO HAVE CHICKENS
OR OTHER ANIMALS BUT CANNOT


[City of Fremont] 20:07:11
So I think, saying it only affects 40 people is a bit synchronous, but I think the idea is that when you draft an ordinance like this, and I don't agree it's a living document.

[Captioner] 20:07:12
CURRENTLY BECAUSE OF OUR CURRENT
ORDINANCE.
SO I THINK SAYING

[Captioner] 20:07:15
 IT ONLY
AFFECTS 40 PEOPLE IS A

[Captioner] 20:07:18
 BIT
DISINGENUOUS, BUT I THINK THE
IDEA IS THAT WHEN YOU DRAFT AN


[City of Fremont] 20:07:20
Because realistically, we don't. A mend ordinances very often, and when you draft an ordinance like this I think it's important that it be drafted after the community feedback is made.

[Captioner] 20:07:21
ORDINANCE LIKE THIS -- AND I
DON'T AGREE IT A LIVING
DOCUMENT,

[Captioner] 20:07:24
 BECAUSE REALISTICALLY,
WE DON'T AMEND ORDINANCES VERY
OFTEN.


[Captioner] 20:07:28
AND WHEN YOU DRAFT AN ORDINANCE
LIKE THIS, I THINK

[Captioner] 20:07:31
 IT'S
IMPORTANT THAT IT BE

[City of Fremont] 20:07:33
Not that community feedback is gathered after the ordinance is drafted, and if you look at the feedback that came out of that meeting, it was most almost all negative.

[Captioner] 20:07:35
 DRAFTED
AFTER THE COMMUNITY FEEDBACK IS
MADE, NOT THAT COMMUNITY


[Captioner] 20:07:38
FEEDBACK IS GATHERED AFTER THE
ORDINANCE IS DRAFTED.


[Captioner] 20:07:41
AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE FEEDBACK
THAT CAME OUT OF THAT MEETING,
IT

[City of Fremont] 20:07:43
So even if you do take that meeting as a valid way of gathering community input it was almost all negative.

[Captioner] 20:07:44
 WAS ALMOST ALL NEGATIVE.
SO EVEN IF YOU DO

[Captioner] 20:07:47
 TAKE THAT
MEETING AS

[Captioner] 20:07:50
 A VALID

[City of Fremont] 20:07:51
So I just think we need to go back to the drawing board and base, the the drafting of the ordinance on what our community stakeholders say, and I'm very very happy to help with that process.

[Captioner] 20:07:54
 WAY OF
GATHERING COMMUNITY INPUT, IT
WAS ALMOST ALL NEGATIVE.


[Captioner] 20:07:57
SO I JUST THINK WE NEED TO GO
BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD AND
BASE THE

[Captioner] 20:08:01
 DRAFTING OF THE
ORDINANCE ON WHAT OUR COMMUNITY
STAKEHOLDERS SAY.


[City of Fremont] 20:08:02
I know many of the community stakeholders that I know would be very happy to participate in help in that process.

[Captioner] 20:08:04
AND I'M VERY, VERY HAPPY TO HELP
WITH THAT PROCESS.
I

[Captioner] 20:08:07
 KNOW MANY OF THE COMMUNITY
STAKEHOLDERS THAT I KNOW WOULD
BE VERY HAPPY

[City of Fremont] 20:08:09
This

[Captioner] 20:08:11
 TO PARTICIPATE AND
HELP IN THAT PROCESS.


[City of Fremont] 20:08:11
I see Councilmember shell, and also. Councilmember saw one headquarters.

[Captioner] 20:08:15
>> Mayor Mei: I SEE
COUNCILMEMBER SHAO AND ALSO
COUNCILMEMBER

[City of Fremont] 20:08:16
Comments into this. All up, but I think we have a mayor. I just want to make a kind of motion, and I understand the rule is that if I get a second mode a second for the counter, motion then the kind of motion gets voted on first, substitute

[Captioner] 20:08:25
I JUST WANT TO MAKE A COUNTER

[Captioner] 20:08:28

COUNTER MOTION GETS VOTED ON
FIRST.


[City of Fremont] 20:08:33
motion motion. Can I get clarification from our city attorney?

[Captioner] 20:08:37
>> Mayor Mei: SUBSTITUTE MOTION.
CAN I GET CLARIFICATION FROM OUR
CITY ATTORNEY?


[Captioner] 20:08:41
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: I'LL
HAVE TO LOOK UP THE HANDBOOK.
GIVE ME A MOMENT.


[City of Fremont] 20:09:20
emotion to substitute takes precedent over the existing motion.

[Captioner] 20:09:23
A MOTION TO SUBSTITUTE TAKES
PRECEDENT OVER THE EXISTING
MOTION.


[City of Fremont] 20:09:24
Thank you. Well, it needs a second, first, 2, So there's a proposal from.

[Captioner] 20:09:28
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
WELL, IT NEEDS A SECOND FIRST,


[City of Fremont] 20:09:29
I'm sorry. What is the motion? What is the motion?

[Captioner] 20:09:31

>> Ms. Gauthier: I'M SORRY, WHAT


[City of Fremont] 20:09:32
The motion is to, except

[Captioner] 20:09:35
IS THE MOTION?
>> Councilmember Shao: THE
MOTION IS TO ACCEPT

[City of Fremont] 20:09:36
And then you second. So we have a motion a second on the substitute, and for the clarification of our city attorney, the substitute motion takes precedence.

[Captioner] 20:09:39
 THE STAFF'S
RECOMMENDATION

[Captioner] 20:09:42

[Captioner] 20:09:46
>> Councilmember Cox: SECOND.

SECOND ON THE SUBSTITUTE AND FOR


[City of Fremont] 20:09:48
So at this time I'd like to ask for a vote on the substitute motion which is to accept the staff recommendation.

[Captioner] 20:09:49
THE CLARIFICATION OF OUR CITY
ATTORNEY, THE SUBSTITUTE MOTION
TAKES PRECEDENCE.


[Captioner] 20:09:52
SO AT THIS TIME, I'D LIKE TO ASK
