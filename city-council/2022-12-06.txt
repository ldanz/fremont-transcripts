 MAYOR MEI,
FOR PRESENTING OUR CLINIC

[Captioner] 19:11:28
I WILL START BY SAYING TRANS

 IS LOCATED AT

[Captioner] 19:11:36
 LIBERTY
CLINIC, AT

[Captioner] 19:11:39
 39500 LIBERTY STREET.
SO OUR SERVICES ARE MAINLY


[Captioner] 19:11:45
FOCUSED ON HORMONE REPLACEMENT
THERAPY FOR OUR

[Captioner] 19:11:48
 TRANS FOLKS OR
TRANS POPULATION, THAT'S THE
MAJORITY OF

[Captioner] 19:11:51
 OUR CLIENT AND
PATIENTS.


[Captioner] 19:11:54
AND ALSO WE HAVE RAPID HIV
TESTING, WE HAVE

[Captioner] 19:11:57
 STD TESTING AS
WELL.
WE'RE ALSO

[Captioner] 19:12:01
 DOING  NAME AND

[Captioner] 19:12:04
 GENDER
ASSIGN ASSISTANCE.
WE HAVE

[Captioner] 19:12:07
 EVENTS AS WELL, WE HAVE
GROUPS THAT PROVIDE SUPPORT

[Captioner] 19:12:11
 TO
OUR COMMUNITIES, ESPECIALLY --
THIS IS FOR THE

[Captioner] 19:12:14
 GENERAL
COMMUNITIES, THE

[Captioner] 19:12:17
 LGBTQIA PLUS
COMMUNITIES.
WE ALSO HAVE DIFFERENT

[Captioner] 19:12:20
 EVENTS
RECENTLY WE JUST FINISHED

[Captioner] 19:12:25
 THE
TRANSGENDER DAY OF

[Captioner] 19:12:30
 REMEMBRANCE
THAT SHOWS RESILIENCE OF OUR
TRANS FOLKS, ALSO

[Captioner] 19:12:38
 RECOGNIZING
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE

[Captioner] 19:12:44
 STILL
SUFFERING WITH THE


[Captioner] 19:12:48
DISCRIMINATION AND ALSO HATRED.
SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

[Captioner] 19:12:52
 TODAY,
THE HIV, SOME OF OUR POPULATIONS


[Captioner] 19:12:56
ARE HIV-POSITIVE CLIENTS.
WE HELP THEM

[Captioner] 19:13:00
 TO NAVIGATE TO FIND
CARE.


[Captioner] 19:13:04
ESPECIALLY WITH HEALTHCARE
OPPORTUNITIES

[Captioner] 19:13:08
 LIKE HEALTHCARE
INSURANCE, LIKE HEALTH

[Captioner] 19:13:11
 AND --
NAVIGATE AND TO LOOK FOR THE
SERVICES THAT WE HAVE AND TO


[Captioner] 19:13:14
GIVE THE SERVICES THAT WE CAN
OFFER.


[Captioner] 19:13:19
SO WHAT ARE THE BARRIERS USUALLY
WE ENCOUNTER FOR OUR CLIENTS

[Captioner] 19:13:22
 ARE
SOMETIMES MAJORITY OF OUR
CLIENTS ARE -- THEY'RE ALSO PART


[Captioner] 19:13:25
OF THE COMMUNITY, AND ALSO

[Captioner] 19:13:32
 THERE
ARE HOMELESS, THEY DON'T KNOW
THE SERVICES THAT WE OFFER,

[Captioner] 19:13:35
 THEY
DON'T KNOW WHERE TO GO, WHERE
ARE THE CLINICS THAT THEY CAN

[Captioner] 19:13:39
 GO
FOR THE SERVICES, SO

[Captioner] 19:13:42
 THAT'S WHY
BAY AREA COMMUNITY HEALTH TRANS
VISION IS

[Captioner] 19:13:45
 DOING

[Captioner] 19:13:50
 OUTREACH
PROGRAMS THAT WE DO FOR
OUTREACH, WE

[Captioner] 19:13:54
 ALSO PARTICIPATED
IN DIFFERENT KINDS OF EVENTS


[Captioner] 19:13:57
LIKE FOR EXAMPLE LIKE ZEBRAFISH


[Captioner] 19:14:05

SAN FRANCISCO PRIDE, PRIDE
EVENTS.


[Captioner] 19:14:08
WE HELP TO EDUCATE OUR CLIENTS
AND ALSO TO

[Captioner] 19:14:11
 OFFER OUR SERVICES
TO THEM.
WE'RE TRYING TO REACH OUT

[Captioner] 19:14:15
 TO
THEM HAND IN HAND, LIKE ALL THE
WAY TO THEIR

[Captioner] 19:14:18
 HOUSES SOMETIMES,
WE ALSO VISITED

[Captioner] 19:14:24
 SOME OF THE
AREAS

[Captioner] 19:14:27
 THAT ARE -- WE HAVE TENTS,
YOU KNOW,

[Captioner] 19:14:33
 AND THIS -- THE
CLIENTS WE ARE SERVING, WHICH
ARE THE

[Captioner] 19:14:37
 HOMELESS POPULATION AND
ALSO THE SUBSTANCE

[Captioner] 19:14:40
 USERS AS
WELL.
SO

[Captioner] 19:14:43
 OUR CLINIC IS OPEN

[Captioner] 19:14:48
 9:00 TO
5:30 FROM MONDAY TO FRIDAY.
WE ALSO EXTEND OUR

[Captioner] 19:14:51
 SERVICES ALL
THE WAY TO WEEKENDS

[Captioner] 19:14:54
 OR THE
EVENTS AS WELL

[Captioner] 19:14:58
 AS TABLING EVENTS
AND ALSO RAPID HIV

[Captioner] 19:15:03
 TESTING, ALSO


[Captioner] 19:15:06
WE OFFER SAFE SEX MATERIALS TO


[Captioner] 19:15:11
OUR CLIENTS AND ALSO FREE NEEDLE
EXCHANGE TO SUBSTANCE USERS.


[Captioner] 19:15:14
IF WE'RE TALKING

[Captioner] 19:15:18
 ABOUT HIV, IT
IS NOT ALWAYS IN

[Captioner] 19:15:23
 THE COMMUNITY.
I KNOW IT WAS A GOAL TO HAVE


[Captioner] 19:15:27
SOMEONE TO SPEAK ABOUT THEIR
STORIES

[Captioner] 19:15:31
 REGARDING THEIR STATUS
AS HIV-POSITIVE.
ONE REASON WHY

[Captioner] 19:15:34
 IT'S SO HARD TO
FIND A

[Captioner] 19:15:37
 PERSON TO SPEAK

[Captioner] 19:15:40
 ABOUT
THEIR STORIES OR STATUS, ONE
THING IS THE

[Captioner] 19:15:43
 STIGMA THAT WE
FACE.
MAJORITY OF MY

[Captioner] 19:15:47
 PATIENTS ARE
TRANS FOLKS

[Captioner] 19:15:52
 OR TRANSGENDER AND
TRANSGENDER WOMEN,

[Captioner] 19:15:55
 TRANSGENDER
MEN, SO THOSE ARE THE POPULATION
THAT WE SERVE IN TRANS

[Captioner] 19:15:58
 VISION.
WE

[Captioner] 19:16:01
 EXPERIENCE A STIGMA ASIDE
FROM OUR GENDER.


[Captioner] 19:16:07
IT'S -- IT IS BECAUSE ON HOW WE
TAKE IT OR HOW WE THINK ABOUT
THE

[Captioner] 19:16:10
 HIV.
WE ALWAYS THINK

[Captioner] 19:16:12
 ABOUT HIV IS
ALWAYS CONNECTED TO THE
COMMUNITY AS WELL.


[Captioner] 19:16:15
I THINK WE

[Captioner] 19:16:21
 HAVE TO THINK ABOUT
THE THINGS THAT

[Captioner] 19:16:24
 WE -- WE SHOULD
ALSO ENCOURAGE EVERYBODY TO
UNDERSTAND

[Captioner] 19:16:27
 THAT IT'S NOT -- IF
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HIV,

[Captioner] 19:16:30
 IT'S
NOT ALWAYS IN OUR

[Captioner] 19:16:32
 COMMUNITY,
IT'S ALSO COMING FROM ANY
GENDER.


[Captioner] 19:16:36
SO I THINK ONE THING THAT IT'S
HARD FOR THEM

[Captioner] 19:16:39
 TO SHARE THEIR
STORIES IS BECAUSE OF THE STIGMA
THAT WE FACE, AND

[Captioner] 19:16:43
 THAT'S ONE OF
THE BIGGEST CONCERNS

[Captioner] 19:16:46
 OF THE
COMMUNITY, THE LGBT COMMUNITY,


[Captioner] 19:16:50
TO BE ALSO ACCESSING HEALTHCARE
AS

[Captioner] 19:16:52
 WELL.
THAT'S ONE THING ALSO THAT THEY
ARE FACING AS WELL.


[Captioner] 19:16:57
SO I THINK THE IMPORTANCE OF


[Captioner] 19:17:03
HEALTH EDUCATION TO EACH

[Captioner] 19:17:07
 CLIENT
OR SERVICES THAT WE OFFER, IT'S
REALLY IMPORTANT TO

[Captioner] 19:17:12
 HAVE THAT
KNOWLEDGE OF HOW WE CAN SHARE
THE

[Captioner] 19:17:16
 KNOWLEDGE THAT WE HAVE AS

[Captioner] 19:17:20
 A
CLINIC, ESPECIALLY KNOWING OR


[Captioner] 19:17:23
UNDERSTANDING THE HIV OR HOW WE
TRANSMIT

[Captioner] 19:17:27
 THE DISEASE FROM

[Captioner] 19:17:30
 OTHER
PERSON TO ANOTHER PERSON.


[Captioner] 19:17:33
AND ALSO TO EDUCATE OUR CLIENTS
AS WELL.


[Captioner] 19:17:36
WE OFFER IN OUR CLINIC IN TRANS
VISION, WE OFFER ALSO PREP


[Captioner] 19:17:40
MEDICATIONS.
PREP MEDICATION IS ONE OF THE
EFFECTIVE

[Captioner] 19:17:44
 WAYS ON HOW WE PREVENT


[Captioner] 19:17:51
HIV, AND WORLD AIDS DAY,
ACTUALLY AS A CLINIC, WE HAD

[Captioner] 19:17:54
 AN
EVENT IN OUR

[Captioner] 19:17:59
 CLINIC FROM ALAMEDA
COUNTY AND ALSO SANTA

[Captioner] 19:18:02
 CLARA
COUNTY.
WE ALSO HAD AN EVENT THAT IS

[Captioner] 19:18:05
 FOR
WORLD AIDS DAY

[Captioner] 19:18:10
 THAT WE GIVE OUT
THE

[Captioner] 19:18:13
 AIDS TEST KIT TO EVERYBODY.
WE GENERALIZE THE POPULATION
BECAUSE WE

[Captioner] 19:18:19
 TRY TO ELIMINATE THE
STIGMA.
AGAIN, IT'S NOT ONLY FOR

[Captioner] 19:18:23
 THE
LGBT COMMUNITY, I

[Captioner] 19:18:29
 THINK
PREVENTION FOR HIV IS FOR
EVERYBODY.


[Captioner] 19:18:32
I THINK THAT'S HOW TRANSVISION
WORKS IN.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.


[Captioner] 19:18:36
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU, YUGI.
WE ARE VERY FORTUNATE TO

[Captioner] 19:18:39
 HAVE
THE RESOURCE AND TO BE ABLE TO


[Captioner] 19:18:42
CREATE THE AWARENESS FOR WORLD
AIDS DAY, AND I THINK THAT THE
QUESTION OF

[Captioner] 19:18:45
 PUTTING THE

[Captioner] 19:18:49
 TEST AND
TRY TO ACHIEVE EQUITY IS ONE OF
THE ONES WE'RE

[Captioner] 19:18:52
 HOPING TO BE ABLE
TO HONOR AND IT IMPORTANT FOR US
TO KEEP

[Captioner] 19:18:55
 EVERYONE HEALTHY, SO I'M
GLAD THAT BAY AREA HEALTH IS A


[Captioner] 19:18:58
WONDERFUL RESOURCE HERE IN OUR
COMMUNITY, SO THANK YOU FOR
JOINING US TODAY.


[Captioner] 19:19:02
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH.
>> Mayor Mei: NEXT IS ORAL


[Captioner] 19:19:06
COMMUNICATIONS, AND I'D LIKE

[Captioner] 19:19:09
 TO
SEE IF THERE'S ANY SPEAKERS
WHOSE HANDS ARE RAISED FOR THAT.


[Captioner] 19:19:15
ALBERTO?
>> Mr. Quintanilla: YES.
>> Mayor Mei: 

[Captioner] 19:19:18
THESE ARE ITEMS
THAT ARE NOT AGENDIZED ON OUR
CALENDAR THIS

[Captioner] 19:19:21
 EVENING.
>> Mr. Quintanilla: 

[Captioner] 19:19:24
OUR FIRST
SPEAKER IS JOHN HINDS.
>> Mayor Mei: WELCOME, JOHN.


[Captioner] 19:19:29
>> HELLO, EVERYONE.
PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS IS NOT


[Captioner] 19:19:32
ABOUT ITEM 6 TONIGHT.
35 YEARS FROM NOW

[Captioner] 19:19:35
 WILL BE THE
YEAR 2057.


[Captioner] 19:19:41
THAT SEEMS SO FAR INTO THE
FUTURE THAT IT'S HARD TO

[Captioner] 19:19:44
 IMAGINE
WHAT LIFE WILL BE LIKE THEN.
WILL PEOPLE

[Captioner] 19:19:49
 IN

[Captioner] 19:19:52
 FREMONT -- IF
INSTEAD WE LOOK BACK 35 YEARS,
WE

[Captioner] 19:19:55
 CAN SEE HOW VERY LITTLE DID
CHANGE IN

[Captioner] 19:19:59
 THAT TIME, AND WE
COULD TRY TO IMAGINE

[Captioner] 19:20:02
 WHAT
FREMONT WAS THINKING WHEN IT
APPROVED A DEVELOPMENT ON WHAT'S


[Captioner] 19:20:04
NOW STANFORD AVENUE WITHOUT
PROVIDING PARKING AT THE
TRAILHEAD.


[Captioner] 19:20:07
DID THEY THINK THEN THAT WE'D
HAVE

[Captioner] 19:20:10
 THE ANTIGRAVITY BOOTS BY
NOW?
WELL, SOME THINGS WERE


[Captioner] 19:20:14
PREDICTABLE.
WE HAD AN ATTRACTION, A TRAIL
THAT WAS GOING TO

[Captioner] 19:20:17
 DRAW PEOPLE
WHO WERE GOING TO GET

[Captioner] 19:20:20
 THERE
PRESUMABLY IN CARS, THEY WERE
PROBABLY GOING TO PARK AND IF WE


[Captioner] 19:20:23
DIDN'T PROVIDE FOR ORDERED
PARKING, WE WOULD GET DISORDERED


[Captioner] 19:20:28
PARKING.
AND IF THE CITY HAD INSISTED ON
A PARKING LOT BACK

[Captioner] 19:20:31
 THEN, THAT
WOULD HAVE SAFEGUARDED THE
INTERESTS OF THE RESIDENTS WHO


[Captioner] 19:20:35
MOVED INTO THAT AREA BY GIVING
THEM SOME CLARITY ON WHAT

[Captioner] 19:20:40
 TO
EXPECT, AND IT WOULD HAVE
SAFEGUARDED THE INTERESTS OF THE


[Captioner] 19:20:43
PUBLIC WHO WANTED ACCESS TO THE
PUBLIC TRAILHEAD.
THE CITY DID NOT.


[Captioner] 19:20:49
AND WE'RE STILL ARGUING NOW, 35
YEARS LATER, WITH

[Captioner] 19:20:52
 NO WIN-WIN
SOLUTIONS AVAILABLE.
SO LET'S

[Captioner] 19:20:55
 LOOK FORWARD AGAIN.
WHEN WE

[Captioner] 19:20:58
 MAKE LAND USE DECISIONS
TODAY THAT CREATE ATTRACTIONS
FOR PEOPLE.


[Captioner] 19:21:02
TRAIL HEADS, PARKS, SHOPPING
AREAS,

[Captioner] 19:21:05
 EVENT CENTERS.
IF WE DON'T PLAN FOR ENOUGH
PARKING

[Captioner] 19:21:08
 OR FOR ENOUGH ROAD
CAPACITY FOR PEOPLE TO GET

[Captioner] 19:21:12

THERE, ARE WE JUST ASSUMING THAT
IN THE NEXT 35 YEARS,

[Captioner] 19:21:15
 WE ARE
REALLY GOING TO GET THE SOLAR
TRAINS

[Captioner] 19:21:18
 AND SAIL BUSES THAT WE
DIDN'T GET IN THE LAST 35?


[Captioner] 19:21:22
THAT CURRENT NEEDS WILL


[Captioner] 19:21:25
DISAPPEAR AND THE NEAR FUTURE
WILL HAVE NO RESEMBLANCE TO THE


[Captioner] 19:21:28
NEAR PAST?
IF SO, WE ARE BASING OUR PLANS
ON

[Captioner] 19:21:32
 BELIEF AND MAGIC, AND WE'RE
SETTING UP THE SAME KINDS OF


[Captioner] 19:21:35
INTRACTABLE PROBLEMS 35 YEARS
INTO THE

[Captioner] 19:21:40
 FUTURE THAT

[Captioner] 19:21:43
 WILL BE
HERE AGAIN 35 MINUTES FROM
TONIGHT.


[Captioner] 19:21:46
THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
>> Mr. Quintanilla: OUR NEXT


[Captioner] 19:21:49
SPEAKER IS KELLY ABREU.
>> THANK

[Captioner] 19:21:52
 YOU.
SO IN THE SPIRIT OF THE LAST
COMMENT WHICH

[Captioner] 19:21:56
 WAS NOT ABOUT ITEM 6, I'LL POINT YOU TO AN


[Captioner] 19:21:59
AGREEMENT SIGNED BETWEEN THE
CITY AND THE

[Captioner] 19:22:02
 PARK DISTRICT.
ON JUNE 8TH, 2010.
FOR

[Captioner] 19:22:06
 THE ARDENWOOD HISTORIC FARM.
THAT WAS

[Captioner] 19:22:09
 IN 2010, AND THE TERM
OF THE LEASE

[Captioner] 19:22:12
 AGREEMENT, 50
YEARS.
50 YEARS.


[Captioner] 19:22:16
NOW, IF YOU GO THERE THIS
WEEKEND, YOU'LL FIND PEOPLE
DRESSING UP IN

[Captioner] 19:22:19
 OLD VICTORIAN
COSTUMES, AND THEY TRY

[Captioner] 19:22:22
 TO
MAINTAIN THAT IN A STATE OF
HISTORICAL

[Captioner] 19:22:28
 STASIS.
IN ALWAYS LIVING, YOU KNOW,
SOMEWHERE IN

[Captioner] 19:22:31
 THE VICTORIAN ERA,
YOU KNOW, WAY BACK

[Captioner] 19:22:34
 WHEN, AND IN
A STATE OF

[Captioner] 19:22:40
 HAPPINESS AND
HARMONY, AND CONTINUING ON,
LOOKING INTO

[Captioner] 19:22:44
 THE FUTURE, AS THE
PREVIOUS SPEAKER

[Captioner] 19:22:49
 SAID, THE
ALAMEDA COUNTY FLOOD CONTROL
DISTRICT

[Captioner] 19:22:52
 OWNS 40 ACRES OF LAND
IN CENTRAL PARK.
THE

[Captioner] 19:22:56
 NAME, IT'S MISNAMED

[Captioner] 19:22:59

STEIBER'S LAGOON.
40 ACRES.


[Captioner] 19:23:02
IT'S NOT EVEN A LAGOON BECAUSE
IT'S KIND OF A DRY,

[Captioner] 19:23:07
 BRUSHY
TREE-FILLED SHRUBS, AND


[Captioner] 19:23:10
40 ACRES, AND IT'S KIND OF A
MESS.
IN FACT, I THINK IT

[Captioner] 19:23:13
 HAD A COUPLE
OF FIRES THERE LAST

[Captioner] 19:23:16
 SUMMER, IF
THE FIRE DEPARTMENT PROBABLY
KNOWS ABOUT THOSE.


[Captioner] 19:23:20
SO THIS ALAMEDA COUNTY FLOOD
CONTROL DISTRICT IS HEADED

[Captioner] 19:23:23
 UP BY
DANIEL WOLD

[Captioner] 19:23:27
 ESENBET, AND THEY
HAVE GOTTEN SOME MONEY FROM

[Captioner] 19:23:30
 THE
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, $2 MILLION,
AND OF COURSE WHY AM

[Captioner] 19:23:33
 I TALKING
ABOUT THIS?
BECAUSE WE DON'T

[Captioner] 19:23:35
 HEAR ABOUT THIS
FROM THE CITY.
WE DO HEAR ABOUT IT FROM THE


[Captioner] 19:23:39
COUNTY, THEY DO HAVE DOCUMENTS
OUT THERE, BUT THE CITY REALLY
HASN'T PUBLICIZE

[Captioner] 19:23:42
 THE FUTURE
PLANS FOR 40 ACRES IN CENTRAL


[Captioner] 19:23:46
PARK.
THIS FLOOD CONTROL DISTRICT WILL
PLAN, DESIGN AND EXCAVATE

[Captioner] 19:23:49
 A NEW
OPEN WATER POND,

[Captioner] 19:23:52
 CONSTRUCT A
RIPARIAN CORRIDOR, CONSTRUCT A
RECREATIONAL

[Captioner] 19:23:55
 TRAIL ALONGSIDE
MISSION CREEK.
THEY WILL ALSO BUILD A


[Captioner] 19:24:00
PEDESTRIAN BRIDGE OVER MISSION
CREEK AND BUILD A CATWALK

[Captioner] 19:24:03
 FOR
PEDESTRIAN ACCESS.
THEY WILL PLANT

[Captioner] 19:24:05
 NATIVE
VEGETATION TO ENHANCE THE
HABITAT.


[Captioner] 19:24:09
THE CITY KNOWS ABOUT THIS
BECAUSE THE CITY DID THE
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT

[Captioner] 19:24:11
 ON
THIS.
NOW, THE CITY IS ALSO EXPECTED


[Captioner] 19:24:16
TO NEGOTIATE AN AGREEMENT, A
LEGAL AGREEMENT WITH

[Captioner] 19:24:19
 THE COUNTY,
WITH THE

[Captioner] 19:24:23
 FLOOD CONTROL DISTRICT,
AND THE CITY PARKS AND
RECREATION DEPARTMENT IS


[Captioner] 19:24:26
EXPECTED TO TAKE FULL
RESPONSIBILITY FOR

[Captioner] 19:24:30
 MAINTAINING
AND OPERATING THESE NEW


[Captioner] 19:24:33
RECREATIONAL AMENITIES.
NOW,

[Captioner] 19:24:38
 WE 

[Captioner] 19:24:41
 HERE AS FREMONT
RESIDENTS LOOK FORWARD TO ALL
THESE NEW

[Captioner] 19:24:43
 RECREATIONAL THINGS,
THE NEW TRAILS, THE NEW
HABITATS.


[Captioner] 19:24:47
THIS IS GOING TO BE A WONDERFUL
NEW THING AND IT NEEDS TO BE
PUBLICIZE

[Captioner] 19:24:50
 MORE.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:24:53
>> Mr. Quintanilla: OUR NEXT
SPEAKER IS IRIS.


[Captioner] 19:25:05
>> Mayor Mei: WELCOME, IRIS.


[Captioner] 19:25:15
>> Mr. Quintanilla: IRIS?
>> Mayor Mei: IRIS,

[Captioner] 19:25:18
 CAN YOU
UNMUTE?


[Captioner] 19:25:25
>> Mr. Quintanilla: YOU'RE
UNMUTED, IRIS.
YOU CAN SPEAK.


[Captioner] 19:25:40
>> Mayor Mei: PERHAPS SHOULD WE
MOVE TO THE NEXT SPEAKER AND
COME BACK

[Captioner] 19:25:44
 TO IRIS?
>> Mayor Mei: THAT IS THE LAST
HAND WE CURRENTLY HAVE

[Captioner] 19:25:47
 RAISED.
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY.


[Captioner] 19:25:50
DO WE SEE HER -- OR THEM

[Captioner] 19:25:53
 ON --
>> Mr. Quintanilla: YEAH AND IT
SHOWS THAT SHE'S UNMUTED.


[Captioner] 19:25:56
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY.


[Captioner] 19:26:00
I GUESS ONE MORE -- I GUESS
THAT'S THE FINAL CALL

[Captioner] 19:26:03
 FOR IRIS
IN THE ORAL COMMUNICATIONS.
IF YOU'RE HAVING DIFFICULTIES,


[Captioner] 19:26:06
FEEL FREE TO USE THE CHAT OR


[Captioner] 19:26:09
ANOTHER RESOURCE TO REACH OUR
CITY CLERK.
AT THIS

[Captioner] 19:26:13
 TIME, I'M GOING TO CLOSE
ORAL

[Captioner] 19:26:16
 COMMUNICATIONS.
AND I WILL RETURN TO OUR
REGULARLY

[Captioner] 19:26:20
 SCHEDULED ITEM, AND
THAT IS

[Captioner] 19:26:24
 OUR ITEM 5A, THE


[Captioner] 19:26:28
I-880 INNOVATION BRIDGE AND
TRAIL PROJECT, AND OUR PUBLIC
WORKS DIRECTOR, HANS

[Captioner] 19:26:30
 LARSEN,
WILL BE PROVIDING A PRESENTATION
THIS EVENING.


[Captioner] 19:26:36
WELCOME.


[Captioner] 19:26:44
>> Mr. Larsen: GOOD EVENING,
MAYOR MEI AND MEMBERS OF THE


[Captioner] 19:26:47
COUNCIL.
I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU CAN
HEAR ME AND SEE OUR

[Captioner] 19:26:50
 PRESENTATION
SCREEN?
SO I'M PLEASED TO PRESENT

[Captioner] 19:26:54
 TO YOU
A REPORT ON THE PROGRESS FOR A
MAJOR

[Captioner] 19:26:57
 NEW TRAIL EXPANSION
PROJECT, A PROJECT REFERRED TO


[Captioner] 19:27:00
AS THE

[Captioner] 19:27:03
 I-880/INNOVATION BRIDGE
AND TRAIL.
THIS PROJECT WILL LINK

[Captioner] 19:27:06
 TOGETHER
THE TWO SIDES OF THE

[Captioner] 19:27:09
 FREMONT
INNOVATION DISTRICT AND THE WARM
SPRINGS SOUTH

[Captioner] 19:27:13
 FREMONT AREA.
AND A MAJOR ELEMENT OF THE
PROJECT

[Captioner] 19:27:18
 IS WHAT'S ILLUSTRATED
HERE AS A NEW BRIDGE FOR PEOPLE
WALKING AND

[Captioner] 19:27:21
 BIKING ACROSS
INTERSTATE 880.
WHERE TODAY AT

[Captioner] 19:27:25
 A MAJOR MILESTONE
IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS
PROJECT

[Captioner] 19:27:30
 WITH COMPLETION OF THE
PRELIMINARY DESIGN, AS WELL AS
THE ENVIRONMENTAL CLEARANCE,


[Captioner] 19:27:33
WHICH IS AN ITEM THAT IS --


[Captioner] 19:27:36
WE'RE RECOMMENDING THAT YOU
APPROVE HERE

[Captioner] 19:27:40
 TONIGHT.
LET ME SHARE WITH YOU A LITTLE
BIT MORE ABOUT THE PROJECT.


[Captioner] 19:27:43
SO THE PROJECT'S GOALS ARE TO
CONNECT THE WARM

[Captioner] 19:27:47
 SPRINGS BART
STATION AREA

[Captioner] 19:27:50
 AREA TO THE BAYSIDE
BUSINESS DISTRICT AS WELL AS THE
BAY TRAIL.


[Captioner] 19:27:53
WHAT THIS PROJECT DOES IS KIND
OF

[Captioner] 19:27:56
 TAKES AWAY THE ISOLATION OF
THE BAYSIDE BUSINESS DISTRICT


[Captioner] 19:28:00
FROM OTHER PARTS OF FREMONT AND
PARTICULARLY

[Captioner] 19:28:03
 TRANSIT ACCESS, AND
LINKS TOGETHER THE

[Captioner] 19:28:06
 GROWING
NEIGHBORHOOD AROUND THE WARM


[Captioner] 19:28:09
SPRINGS BART STATION, CONNECTS
TRANSIT,

[Captioner] 19:28:12
 HOUSING, JOBS, AS WELL
AS

[Captioner] 19:28:16
 RECREATION OPPORTUNITIES WITH
A CONNECTION TO THE BAY TRAIL.
THIS

[Captioner] 19:28:19
 PROJECT EXPANDS UPON WORK
THAT'S

[Captioner] 19:28:22
 ALREADY BEEN DELIVERED
THAT INCLUDES THE BART STATION
THAT

[Captioner] 19:28:25
 RECENTLY COMPLETED WEST
ACCESS

[Captioner] 19:28:30
 BRIDGE, AND A TRAIL THAT
WAS CONSTRUCTED

[Captioner] 19:28:33
 THROUGH THE
LENNAR DEVELOPMENT ALONG QUANTUM
DRIVE.


[Captioner] 19:28:36
FROM THERE, THE PROJECT PICKS UP
AND

[Captioner] 19:28:41
 IT GOES ADJACENT TO THE
TESLA

[Captioner] 19:28:44
 FACTORY FRONTAGE ON KATO
ROAD.
THAT'S SHOWN IN

[Captioner] 19:28:47
 YELLOW ON THE
EXHIBIT TO THE RIGHT.
AND THEN WE HAVE A

[Captioner] 19:28:51
 NEW BRIDGE
THAT CROSSES

[Captioner] 19:28:54
 I-880, AND IT
CONNECTS INTO THE BAYSIDE
BUSINESS

[Captioner] 19:28:58
 DISTRICT ALONG --
ADJACENT TO A FLOOD CONTROL


[Captioner] 19:29:01
CHANNEL AND PROVIDES A
CONNECTION BETWEEN LANDING
PARKWAY

[Captioner] 19:29:05
 AND FREMONT BOULEVARD,
AND AT THAT POINT, IT CONNECTS
TO THE BAY

[Captioner] 19:29:08
 TRAIL SYSTEM.
SO AGAIN, PART OF THIS PROJECT
IS

[Captioner] 19:29:11
 REALLY TO KNIT TOGETHER THE
TWO SIDES OF THE

[Captioner] 19:29:14
 INNOVATION
DISTRICT.
IT'S NOTABLE THAT THIS TRAIL


[Captioner] 19:29:18
SEGMENT IS THE SOUTHERN MOST
SEGMENT OF THE EAST

[Captioner] 19:29:21
 BAY GREENWAY
TRAIL, WHICH IS A MAJOR REGIONAL
TRAIL

[Captioner] 19:29:24
 THAT EXTENDS FROM OAKLAND


[Captioner] 19:29:27
ALL THE WAY SOUTH THROUGH
FREMONT WITH A CONNECTION TO

[Captioner] 19:29:30
 THE
TRAIL SYSTEM IN SANTA CLARA
COUNTY.


[Captioner] 19:29:34
WE'RE FORTUNATE TO BE SUPPORTED
WITH THIS PROJECT WITH

[Captioner] 19:29:38
 FUNDING
THROUGH ALAMEDA COUNTY'S MEASURE
BB PROGRAM, WHICH

[Captioner] 19:29:42
 INCLUDES
SPECIFIC FUNDING FOR THE EAST
BAY GREENWAY.


[Captioner] 19:29:47
THIS PROJECT IS IN STRONG


[Captioner] 19:29:52
ALIGNMENT WITH MANY CITY PLANS
AND

[Captioner] 19:29:55
 POLICIES, AS IDENTIFIED AS A
PRIORITY IN FREMONT'S RECENTLY
APPROVED TRAIL

[Captioner] 19:29:59
 STRATEGY PLAN,
IT'S PART OF OUR BIKE MASTER
PLAN, IT'S

[Captioner] 19:30:02
 CONTAINED IN THE
CITY'S GENERAL PLAN, AND IS A


[Captioner] 19:30:05
CRITICAL PIECE OF INFRASTRUCTURE
AS PART OF THE WARM SPRINGS


[Captioner] 19:30:08
COMMUNITY PLAN.
THIS PROJECT ALSO HAS

[Captioner] 19:30:12
 BEEN
RECOGNIZED AS A REGIONAL


[Captioner] 19:30:15
PRIORITY, AND IT IS INCLUDED AS
A NEAR-TERM PROJECT FOR

[Captioner] 19:30:18
 DELIVERY
IN THE COUNTY TRANSPORTATION
PLAN APPROVED

[Captioner] 19:30:22
 BY ALAMEDA COUNTY
TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION, AND
IT IS

[Captioner] 19:30:25
 ALSO A TIER 1 PRIORITY IN


[Captioner] 19:30:28
PLAN BY AREA, WHICH MEANS IT'S A
PROJECT THAT IS INTENDED TO BE


[Captioner] 19:30:31
FUNDED AND COMPLETED WITHIN THE
NEXT 15 YEARS.


[Captioner] 19:30:39
THIS PROJECT IS A SIGNIFICANT
OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY CONNECT
COMMUNITIES AND IMPROVE

[Captioner] 19:30:42
 ACCESS
TO TRANSIT

[Captioner] 19:30:46
 AND JOBS AND
RECREATION, AND ACCORDINGLY,
PROJECTS OF THIS TYPE

[Captioner] 19:30:49
 ARE
CONSIDERED PRIORITIES FOR
FUNDING FROM REGIONAL, STATE

[Captioner] 19:30:52
 AND
FEDERAL SOURCES.


[Captioner] 19:30:56
SO JUST A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE
HISTORY OF THE PROJECT.
WE

[Captioner] 19:31:00
 COMPLETED A SCOPING CONCEPT
FOR THIS

[Captioner] 19:31:07
 IN 2016 WITH FUNDING
FROM MEASURE BB.
AFTER THAT

[Captioner] 19:31:10
 SCOPING REPORT WAS
COMPLETED, WE WERE ABLE TO GET

[Captioner] 19:31:15
 A
$5.5 MILLION GRANT FROM ALAMEDA
COUNTY TRANSPORTATION

[Captioner] 19:31:18
 COMMISSION
TO DO THE WORK THAT WE'RE
WORKING

[Captioner] 19:31:23
 ON NOW, AND THAT
INCLUDES ENVIRONMENTAL CLEARANCE
FOR BOTH STATE AND FEDERAL


[Captioner] 19:31:26
SOURCES, AS WELL AS FULLY
FUNDING THE PROJECT THROUGH
FINAL

[Captioner] 19:31:32
 DESIGN.
THE CITY

[Captioner] 19:31:35
 HIRED T.Y. LIN


[Captioner] 19:31:38
INTERNATIONAL WITH SPECIALTY IN
UNIQUE DESIGN PROJECTS AS OUR
PROJECT DESIGNER.


[Captioner] 19:31:41
THE COUNCIL APPROVED AN
AGREEMENT WITH THEM

[Captioner] 19:31:45
 IN 2018.
AND THEN THERE'S BEEN A

[Captioner] 19:31:48
 VERY
CLOSE PARTNERSHIP WITH CALTRANS
BECAUSE OF THE

[Captioner] 19:31:51
 FREEWAY CROSSING
AND CALTRANS APPROVED THE BRIDGE


[Captioner] 19:31:54
DESIGN CONCEPT

[Captioner] 19:31:59
 IN 2020.
AND WE ARE HERE TODAY TO REVIEW
AND APPROVE THE

[Captioner] 19:32:02
 CEQA LEVEL
ENVIRONMENTAL CLEARANCE FOR THE
PROJECT.


[Captioner] 19:32:06
HERE TONIGHT, CALTRANS IS
HELPING TO FACILITATE

[Captioner] 19:32:09
 A FEDERAL
ENVIRONMENTAL CLEARANCE FOR THE
PROJECT, WHICH IS

[Captioner] 19:32:13
 EXPECTED NEXT
SPRING, AND THAT WILL HELP US
QUALIFY FOR

[Captioner] 19:32:15
 FEDERAL GRANT
FUNDING FOR PROJECT
CONSTRUCTION.


[Captioner] 19:32:20
I JUST WANTED TO POINT OUT THAT
PROBABLY KIND OF THE MOST


[Captioner] 19:32:23
EXCITING AND UNIQUE PART OF THIS
PROJECT

[Captioner] 19:32:27
 IS THE REALLY UNIQUE
BRIDGE STRUCTURE THAT'S PLANNED


[Captioner] 19:32:33
HERE.
AND IT'S REALLY INTENDED TO
SERVE AS -- IT'S KIND OF

[Captioner] 19:32:38
 A
LANDMARK ICONIC IMAGE FOR THE
INNOVATION DISTRICT.


[Captioner] 19:32:42
BUT I WANTED TO POINT OUT THAT
THE UNIQUE DESIGN

[Captioner] 19:32:45
 OF THIS
PROJECT IS ACTUALLY

[Captioner] 19:32:49
 ROOTED IN
SOME VERY TIGHT CONSTRAINTS IN


[Captioner] 19:32:52
THE AREA AND IS ACTUALLY KIND OF
THE

[Captioner] 19:32:55
 MOST COST-EFFECTIVE DESIGN
TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE

[Captioner] 19:32:58
 THE TRAIL
CONNECTION ACROSS 880.
AND SO

[Captioner] 19:33:01
 SOME OF THE CONSTRAINTS
WE FACE HERE IS THE

[Captioner] 19:33:07
 INABILITY TO
PLACE A FOUNDATION IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE 880 FREEWAY,

[Captioner] 19:33:10
 AND SO THIS
NEEDS TO BE SOMEWHAT OF A
SPECIAL STRUCTURE TO BE

[Captioner] 19:33:13
 ABLE TO
FULLY SPAN

[Captioner] 19:33:16
 THE 880 FREEWAY, AND
THEN WE HAVE TO THREAD THE
NEEDLE IN

[Captioner] 19:33:19
 GETTING A RAMP DOWN
INTO A VERY NARROW AREA

[Captioner] 19:33:23
 BETWEEN
880 AND KATO ROAD ACROSS FROM
THE TESLA FACTORY.


[Captioner] 19:33:27
AND SO THAT HAS

[Captioner] 19:33:30
 RESULTED IN THE
MOST COST-EFFECTIVE STRUCTURE
BEING

[Captioner] 19:33:35
 A CABLE STAY STRUCTURE
WHICH IS SHOWN HERE, AND THEN
BECAUSE OF

[Captioner] 19:33:38
 THE UNIQUE CURVATURE
THAT THE SUPPORT CABLES OF THE


[Captioner] 19:33:41
STRUCTURE CREATE ALMOST KIND OF
A

[Captioner] 19:33:46
 SPIROGRAPH-TYPE PATTERN HERE,
WHICH IS REALLY GOING TO BE
QUITE UNIQUE AND SPECIAL AND


[Captioner] 19:33:50
REALLY REPRESENT KIND OF A


[Captioner] 19:33:53
ICONIC LOCATION THAT REALLY
SIGNIFIES THE

[Captioner] 19:33:56
 UNIQUE PLACE AND
THE CREATIVITY OF THE FREMONT
INNOVATION DISTRICT.


[Captioner] 19:34:02
AND SO WE REALLY GIVE KUDOS TO


[Captioner] 19:34:05
TY LIN, OUR DESIGN ARCHITECTS,
AS WELL AS OR PARTNER WITH


[Captioner] 19:34:08
CALTRANS IN COMING UP WITH WHAT
WE THINK IS A REALLY SPECIAL


[Captioner] 19:34:12
PROJECT AND UNIQUE

[Captioner] 19:34:16
 DESIGN.
SO WE'RE HERE TO APPROVE

[Captioner] 19:34:18
 THE --
CONSIDER APPROVAL OF THE
ENVIRONMENTAL CLEARANCE, AND SO


[Captioner] 19:34:22
A INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL STUDY


[Captioner] 19:34:26
AND MITIGATED NEGATIVE
DECLARATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH


[Captioner] 19:34:29
THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL
QUALITY ACT HAS BEEN PREPARED.
SOME OF THE KEY

[Captioner] 19:34:33
 ISSUES IN TERMS
OF POTENTIAL EFFECTS TO THE


[Captioner] 19:34:36
ENVIRONMENT RELATE TO KIND OF
THE CONSTRUCTION

[Captioner] 19:34:39
 AND THE
EXCAVATION TO

[Captioner] 19:34:42
 BUILD THE BRIDGE,
WHICH HAS POTENTIAL TO

[Captioner] 19:34:47
 UNCOVER
VARIOUS TYPES

[Captioner] 19:34:50
 OF

[Captioner] 19:34:59
 PALEOTOLO --
FOR JOINING PROPERTIES RELATED
TO CONSTRUCTION, NOISE AND


[Captioner] 19:35:02
VIBRATION.
AND SO A PLAN HAS BEEN

[Captioner] 19:35:06
 PREPARED
TO MITIGATE THESE ISSUES

[Captioner] 19:35:09
 TO A
LESS THAN SIGNIFICANT LEVEL, AND
SO

[Captioner] 19:35:12
 THERE IS A MITIGATION

[Captioner] 19:35:15

MONITORING AND REPORTING PROGRAM
THAT WE'RE ASKING YOU TO APPROVE


[Captioner] 19:35:19
ALSO THAT'S PART OF THE
ENVIRONMENTAL CLEARANCE.


[Captioner] 19:35:22
THE CITY OF FREMONT HAS ITS OWN


[Captioner] 19:35:26
STANDARDS TO MINIMIZE IMPACTS TO
THE ENVIRONMENT, AND THESE ARE
INCORPORATED

[Captioner] 19:35:29
 INTO THE PROJECT BY
REFERENCE

[Captioner] 19:35:32
 AND THESE DEAL WITH
AIR QUALITY, BIOLOGICAL
RESOURCES, CULTURAL

[Captioner] 19:35:36
 RESOURCES,
CONSTRUCTION NOISE AND TREE
PRESERVATION.


[Captioner] 19:35:40
WE ISSUED THE ENVIRONMENTAL
REPORTS FOR

[Captioner] 19:35:44
 PUBLIC REVIEW IN
AUGUST.
IT WENT THROUGH THE TYPICAL


[Captioner] 19:35:48
NOTIFICATION

[Captioner] 19:35:50
 PROCESS TO PUBLIC
AGENCIES THROUGH THE STATE
CLEARINGHOUSE.


[Captioner] 19:35:54
THERE'S NOTIFICATION TO ADJACENT
PROPERTIES, INFORMATION ON THE


[Captioner] 19:35:57
CITY'S WEBPAGE AND THIS HEARING
TONIGHT HAS BEEN

[Captioner] 19:36:01
 NOTICED AS PART
OF THE COUNCIL AGENDA.


[Captioner] 19:36:04
WE RECEIVED ONE WRITTEN COMMENT,


[Captioner] 19:36:08
ACTUALLY PRIOR TO OUR STAFF


[Captioner] 19:36:11
REPORT AND THROUGH THE PRIMARY
REVIEW PROCESS, THERE WAS ONE


[Captioner] 19:36:14
WRITTEN COMMENT FROM THE
DEPARTMENT OF TOXIC

[Captioner] 19:36:20
 SUBSTANCES
CONTROL THAT RAISED CONCERNS
ABOUT THE POTENTIAL

[Captioner] 19:36:23
 FOR
ENCOUNTERING HAZARDOUS MATERIALS


[Captioner] 19:36:27
DURING EXCAVATION.
WE RECOGNIZE AND ACKNOWLEDGE
THAT POTENTIAL, AND AS

[Captioner] 19:36:30
 PART OF
THE PROJECT, THERE WILL BE SOME
ADDITIONAL SOIL

[Captioner] 19:36:36
 TESTING AND ANY
ISSUES WILL BE COORDINATED WITH
THAT

[Captioner] 19:36:39
 AGENCY.
WE DID RECEIVE

[Captioner] 19:36:42
 ANOTHER COMMENT
ABOUT THE PROJECT BY EMAIL
YESTERDAY FROM THE

[Captioner] 19:36:45
 ALAMEDA
COUNTY WATER DISTRICT, AND

[Captioner] 19:36:49
 OUR
RESPONSE TO THAT IS INCLUDED AS
PART OF YOUR COUNCIL

[Captioner] 19:36:55
 PACKET, AND
THEY'RE RAISING ISSUES TOO THAT
WE CAN ADDRESS WITH

[Captioner] 19:36:58
 THE PROJECT.
THEY DON'T RAISE ANY NEW
ENVIRONMENTAL

[Captioner] 19:37:03
 ISSUES THAT
HAVEN'T BEEN DISCLOSED AS PART
OF THE MAIN DOCUMENT, AND THEIR


[Captioner] 19:37:07
CONCERNS ARE PRIMARILY
ASSOCIATED

[Captioner] 19:37:10
 WITH EXCAVATION AND
FOUNDATION WORK THAT MAY HAVE
IMPACTS

[Captioner] 19:37:14
 TO THE GROUNDWATER TABLE
IN THE AREA.
AND SO WE

[Captioner] 19:37:19
 CERTAINLY RECOGNIZE
THOSE ISSUES AND WE'RE COMMITTED
TO

[Captioner] 19:37:22
 WORKING WITH ALAMEDA COUNTY
WATER DISTRICT TO ADDRESS
ANYTHING

[Captioner] 19:37:25
 THAT COMES UP DURING
THE CONSTRUCTION AND

[Captioner] 19:37:29
 TO PLAN FOR
MANAGING THOSE ISSUES

[Captioner] 19:37:32
 AS PART OF
THE DESIGN PROCESS.


[Captioner] 19:37:36
AND SO JUST IN SUMMARY, THE
ACTIONS HERE ARE

[Captioner] 19:37:39
 FOR COUNCIL TO
CONVENE A PUBLIC HEARING TO


[Captioner] 19:37:42
IMPROVE THE -- APPROVE THE
ENVIRONMENTAL CLEARANCE, WHICH


[Captioner] 19:37:45
INCLUDES ADOPTION OF A MITIGATED
NEGATIVE DECLARATION AND

[Captioner] 19:37:49
 THE
MITIGATION

[Captioner] 19:39:45
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU, HANS.
AT THIS TIME, I'M GOING TO TURN
IT OVER TO COUNCIL FOR QUESTIONS


[Captioner] 19:39:45
AND I SEE COUNCILMEMBER RAJ
SALWAN.
>> THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR, AND


[Captioner] 19:39:46
THANK YOU, MR. LARSEN, FOR THAT
WONDERFUL PRESENTATION.
THE PROJECT REALLY TIED IN


[Captioner] 19:39:47
NICELY TO THE INNOVATION
DISTRICT CONNECTING THE TWO
ENDS, BAYSIDE AS WELL AS THE


[Captioner] 19:39:47
CURRENT INNOVATION DISTRICT.
I GUESS THE BIG ISSUE IS ABOUT
FUNDING, SO THE 77 MILLION, IS


[Captioner] 19:39:47
THAT THROUGH ALAMEDA COUNTY OR
STATE OR FEDERAL OR HOW DO WE
PIECE TOGETHER THAT LARGE


[Captioner] 19:39:50
FUNDING PIECE?
>> THAT WILL BE THE BIG
CHALLENGE, I THINK FOR A PROJECT


[Captioner] 19:39:54
OF THIS SCALE, IT REALLY IS


[Captioner] 19:39:57
PROBABLY PARTICIPATION FROM ALL
OF THE ABOVE.


[Captioner] 19:40:01
SO AS I NOTED, THE EAST BAY
GREENWAY TRAIL

[Captioner] 19:40:04
 WHICH THIS IS A
PART OF, THERE'S A FUNDING

[Captioner] 19:40:08
 POT
WITHIN ALAMEDA COUNTY'S MEASURE
BB PROGRAM

[Captioner] 19:40:11
 THAT COULD ASSIST.


[Captioner] 19:40:15
THERE

[Captioner] 19:40:19
 ARE FUNDS THROUGH REGIONAL
SOURCES THAT WOULD BE MANAGED BY
MTC

[Captioner] 19:40:22
 AND WE'RE IN DISCUSSIONS
WITH THEM, AS WELL AS WE

[Captioner] 19:40:26
 HOPE TO
SECURE FUNDING FROM THE STATE
AND THE FEDERAL

[Captioner] 19:40:29
 GOVERNMENT.
SO AS WE WORK TO GET THE

[Captioner] 19:40:32
 PROJECT
TO HIGHER STATE OF READINESS,
YOU KNOW, WE'LL BE

[Captioner] 19:40:35
 WORKING WITH
OUR PARTNERS AT ALL AGENCIES TO


[Captioner] 19:40:38
WORK ON THE CHALLENGE OF
PROVIDING THE FUNDING.


[Captioner] 19:40:42
>> Councilmember Salwan:WONDERF
UL.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:40:46
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
NEXT I SEE COUNCILMEMBER SHAO
HAS HIS HAND RAISED.


[Captioner] 19:40:51
>> Councilmember Shao: THANK


[Captioner] 19:40:55
YOU.  MAYOR MEI, MAY QUESTION
IS, HAVE WE EVER

[Captioner] 19:40:58
 RECEIVED
FUNDING OF THIS MAGNITUDE AS A


[Captioner] 19:41:04
CITY FROM WHATEVER SOURCES
BECAUSE

[Captioner] 19:41:07
 WE'RE LOOKING AT BETWEEN
50 TO $80 MILLION OF FUNDING

[Captioner] 19:41:11
 FOR
THE EVENTUAL

[Captioner] 19:41:14
 CONSTRUCTION OF THE
PROJECT, AND SO FAR, THE FUNDING
THAT

[Captioner] 19:41:17
 I

[Captioner] 19:41:21
 HAVE HEARD ARE BELOW
$10 MILLION, SO

[Captioner] 19:41:26
 HOW LIKELY WE
CAN GET FUNDING OF THIS
MAGNITUDE BASED

[Captioner] 19:41:29
 ON OUR HISTORY
AS A CITY?
SO THAT'S THE QUESTION.


[Captioner] 19:41:36
>> Mr. Larsen: GOOD QUESTION.
I THINK PROBABLY A COUPLE
EXAMPLES OF

[Captioner] 19:41:39
 HISTORY, SO THE
RECENTLY COMPLETED

[Captioner] 19:41:43
 WEST ACCESS
BRIDGE PROJECT, WHICH CONNECTED
THE WARM SPRINGS BART

[Captioner] 19:41:46
 STATION
INTO THE

[Captioner] 19:41:49
 NEW DEVELOPMENT AREA,
THAT WAS A $41 MILLION PROJECT
IN

[Captioner] 19:41:52
 WHICH WE

[Captioner] 19:41:56
 RECEIVED $30 MILLION
FROM ALAMEDA COUNTY
TRANSPORTATION

[Captioner] 19:42:00
 COMMISSION.
IF YOU KIND OF GO BACK MANY
YEARS IN

[Captioner] 19:42:03
 HISTORY, WE SECURED
OVER $100 MILLION TO

[Captioner] 19:42:06
 HELP
FACILITATE GETTING BART EXTENDED
TO WARM SPRINGS

[Captioner] 19:42:11
 BY BUILDING
GRADE SEPARATIONS AT PASEO PADRE


[Captioner] 19:42:15
PARKWAY AND WARREN, AND SO THAT
WAS

[Captioner] 19:42:20
 OVER $100 MILLION PROJECT,
AND THAT PROJECT SECURED FUNDING
FROM

[Captioner] 19:42:23
 BOTH STATE AND FEDERAL
SOURCES.
SO THERE'S A COUPLE EXAMPLES.


[Captioner] 19:42:26
YOU KNOW, IT CERTAINLY IN HIGHER
RANGE OF PROJECTS

[Captioner] 19:42:29
 THAT WE'VE


[Captioner] 19:42:33
PURSUED, BUT AS YOU LOOK AT SOME
OF THE THINGS THAT ARE BEING


[Captioner] 19:42:36
CONSIDERED AT THE REGIONAL
LEVEL, I

[Captioner] 19:42:39
 MEAN, THE COST TO
EXTEND BART INTO DOWNTOWN
SAN JOSÉ

[Captioner] 19:42:44
 IS $9 BILLION, TO GET
BART -- OR CALTRAIN EXTENDED


[Captioner] 19:42:47
INTO DOWNTOWN SAN FRANCISCO IS
ON THE ORDER

[Captioner] 19:42:51
 OF $5 BILLION, SO
THERE'S -- YOU KNOW,


[Captioner] 19:42:55
TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE IS
EXPENSIVE.
THIS IS IN THE

[Captioner] 19:42:58
 SCHEME OF, YOU
KNOW, THE TYPES OF INVESTMENTS
CONSIDERED AROUND

[Captioner] 19:43:01
 THE BAY AREA,
A

[Captioner] 19:43:04
 RELATIVELY SMALL PROJECT
COMPARED TO SOME OF THE OTHER
THINGS THAT ARE

[Captioner] 19:43:08
 BEING ACTIVELY
PURSUED.


[Captioner] 19:43:13
>> Councilmember Shao: THANK
YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: I'LL

[Captioner] 19:43:14
 ASK A
CLARIFYING QUESTION.
OOPS.


[Captioner] 19:43:19
I SEE A COUNCILMEMBER, I'LL ASK
THE QUESTION FIRST AND THEN I'LL
TURN TO COUNCILMEMBER

[Captioner] 19:43:22
 COX.
BUT TO CLARIFY FOR THE PUBLIC,


[Captioner] 19:43:25
HANS, IF YOU COULD BE SO KIND, I
KNOW THAT THE QUESTION JUST CAME
UP

[Captioner] 19:43:28
 REGARDING FUNDING, AND THAT
THERE'S OFTEN SOMETIMES SOME
CONFUSION

[Captioner] 19:43:31
 AS TO THE FUNDING
ALLOCATIONS LIKE THE MONEY THAT
WE

[Captioner] 19:43:34
 SECURED FROM ALAMEDA COUNTY
TRANSPORTATION

[Captioner] 19:43:37
 COMMISSION.
COULD YOU CLARIFY HOW THAT
DIFFERS FROM, LET'S SAY,

[Captioner] 19:43:40
 OUR
GENERAL FUND, BECAUSE WE'LL BE
TALKING ABOUT BUDGET IN JANUARY,


[Captioner] 19:43:43
SO PEOPLE UNDERSTAND HOW THAT IS
A LITTLE DIFFERENT WHEN

[Captioner] 19:43:47
 IT COMES
TO FUNDING THAT'S ALLOCATED
EITHER FROM

[Captioner] 19:43:50
 THE TRANSPORTATION
COMMISSION OR THROUGH MEASURES,
AND HOW

[Captioner] 19:43:52
 THAT DIFFERENTIATES FROM
THOSE AVAILABLE FOR GENERAL
FUNDS?


[Captioner] 19:43:59
>> Mr. Larsen: YEAH, WE DON'T
ANTICIPATE ANY CITY GENERAL FUND


[Captioner] 19:44:02
MONEYS GOING INTO THIS PROJECT,
SO WE

[Captioner] 19:44:06
 WOULD -- BRIDGING A
FREEWAY AND

[Captioner] 19:44:09
 INTERSTATE HIGHWAY,
THESE ARE TYPICAL PROJECTS THAT


[Captioner] 19:44:12
RECEIVE STATE AND FEDERAL
FUNDING, AND

[Captioner] 19:44:16
 THERE IS A VERY
KIND OF STRONG

[Captioner] 19:44:19
 POLICY INTEREST
TO KIND OF KNIT TOGETHER


[Captioner] 19:44:22
COMMUNITIES, PARTICULARLY TO
CREATE ABILITIES TO WALK AND
BIKE ACROSS

[Captioner] 19:44:25
 FREEWAY CORRIDORS,
AND I THINK ONE OF THE
CHALLENGES IN THIS AREA IS

[Captioner] 19:44:28
 THE
ONLY WAY TO BE ABLE TO CONNECT
TO THE BAYSIDE

[Captioner] 19:44:32
 BUSINESS DISTRICT
IS TO GO THROUGH A VERY BUSY


[Captioner] 19:44:35
FREEWAY INTERCHANGE LIKE THE ONE
AT 880 AND FREMONT BOULEVARD.


[Captioner] 19:44:40
AND SO THERE IS A VERY

[Captioner] 19:44:44
 HIGH
PRIORITY FOCUS WITHIN THE BAY
AREA OR ALAMEDA

[Captioner] 19:44:47
 COUNTY
TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION STATE
AND FEDERAL LEVEL, IS TO

[Captioner] 19:44:50
 REALLY
KNIT TOGETHER COMMUNITIES WITH
TRAILS

[Captioner] 19:44:54
 AND WITH OPPORTUNITIES TO
WALK

[Captioner] 19:44:58
 AND BIKE, TO PROVIDE THAT
LEVEL OF CONNECTIVITY.
SO

[Captioner] 19:45:03
 AGAIN, JUST TO COME BACK TO
THE QUESTION, WE DON'T


[Captioner] 19:45:07
ANTICIPATE SEEING ANY GENERAL
FUND MONEY COMING INTO THIS.


[Captioner] 19:45:10
WE DO HAVE SOME TRANSPORTATION
FUNDS THAT WE RECEIVE

[Captioner] 19:45:14
 FROM
REGIONAL, STATE GAS TAX SOURCES
THAT WOULD

[Captioner] 19:45:17
 BE PART OF
POTENTIALLY A

[Captioner] 19:45:20
 SMALL FREMONT
CONTRIBUTION, BUT WE WOULD LOOK
TO LEVERAGE

[Captioner] 19:45:23
 THAT INTO GETTING
FUNDING FROM KIND OF THE OTHER
BIG THREE SOURCES.


[Captioner] 19:45:26
SO COUNTY, REGION, STATE, AND
FEDERAL.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK

[Captioner] 19:45:29
 YOU.
I JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY BECAUSE
OFTENTIMES I KNOW THERE'S

[Captioner] 19:45:33
 PUBLIC
COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS, AND THE
QUESTION IS, WHY ARE WE

[Captioner] 19:45:36
 USING
THE MONEY FROM OUR TAXPAYERS
THAT ARE LOCAL TO FUND

[Captioner] 19:45:39
 CAPITAL
IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS, AND MAKING
SURE THAT

[Captioner] 19:45:42
 PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT
THOSE FUNDS ARE ACTUALLY COMING


[Captioner] 19:45:46
FROM SEPARATE POOLS WHEN IT
COMES TO CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT
PROGRAMS

[Captioner] 19:45:49
 AS OPPOSED TO OUR
GENERAL FUNDS, WHICH ARE GOING
TO BE

[Captioner] 19:45:52
 BUDGET THAT WE'RE GOING TO
BE TALKING ABOUT THIS YEAR,
EARLY NEXT YEAR.


[Captioner] 19:45:55
SO I JUST WANTED TO THANK YOU
FOR THAT CLARIFICATION SO THAT
THE PUBLIC

[Captioner] 19:45:58
 UNDERSTANDS, THOSE
ARE SEPARATE POOLS OF MONEY THAT
CANNOT BE

[Captioner] 19:46:02
 EXCHANGED WITHIN THAT.
COUNCILMEMBER COX, DO YOU HAVE A


[Captioner] 19:46:06
CLARIFYING QUESTION?


[Captioner] 19:46:10
PLEASE.


[Captioner] 19:46:16
>> Councilmember Cox: CAN YOU
HEAR ME NOW?
OKAY.


[Captioner] 19:46:19
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU

[Captioner] 19:46:23
 SO MUCH TO HANS AND
THE REST OF THE TEAM FOR THEIR
HARD

[Captioner] 19:46:26
 WORK ON THIS PROJECT.
AND IT

[Captioner] 19:46:29
 LOOKS -- THIS IS THE
FUTURE, I'VE BEEN PART OF THE
ECONOMIC

[Captioner] 19:46:33
 DEVELOPMENT COMMISSION
OVER 12 YEARS AGO, AND I
REMEMBER WHEN

[Captioner] 19:46:36
 WE FIRST STARTED
TALKING ABOUT THE

[Captioner] 19:46:39
 INNOVATION
DISTRICT, AND SEEING HOW

[Captioner] 19:46:42
 IT'S
NOW BECOMING INTO

[Captioner] 19:46:46
 FULL BLOOM.
AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT --
BESIDES THE

[Captioner] 19:46:50
 FUNDING THAT WE JUST
TALKED ABOUT, I

[Captioner] 19:46:54
 WANTED TO ADD A
LITTLE BIT MORE ON GIVING SOME
MORE EXPLANATION AND


[Captioner] 19:46:57
UNDERSTANDING

[Captioner] 19:47:02
 MITIGATION PLAN.
BASED ON SOME OF THE FINDINGS,
THERE IS SOME

[Captioner] 19:47:05
 HAZARDOUS MATERIAL
THAT'S BEING FOUND SUCH AS
BENZENE AND

[Captioner] 19:47:11
 IN THE GROUNDWATER, AND
SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WOULD BE


[Captioner] 19:47:16
USED TO -- THAT COULD COME UP,
OTHER TYPES

[Captioner] 19:47:19
 OF CONTAMINANTS.
AND IF YOU COULD EXPLAIN A
LITTLE

[Captioner] 19:47:24
 BIT MORE OF -- I
UNDERSTAND THERE'S A MITIGATION
PLAN, BUT

[Captioner] 19:47:27
 HOW RIGOROUS IS THE
TESTING AND THINGS

[Captioner] 19:47:32
 LIKE THAT,
THAT WILL BE OCCURRING DURING
THIS PART OF

[Captioner] 19:47:35
 THE PROJECT IF
FUNDING IS FOUND AND IDENTIFIED
AND

[Captioner] 19:47:38
 BEING ABLE TO BE USED FOR
THIS PROJECT?


[Captioner] 19:47:44
>> GREAT, THANK YOU FOR THAT
QUESTION.
I'D LIKE TO REFER THIS TO

[Captioner] 19:47:47
 OUR
ENVIRONMENTAL

[Captioner] 19:47:53
 SPECIALIST, ANDREW

[Captioner] 19:47:57
METZGER.
>> HI.
ALL RIGHT.


[Captioner] 19:48:00
SO THANKS FOR THE QUESTION.
SO AS YOU

[Captioner] 19:48:04
 MENTIONED, THERE IS A
MITIGATION

[Captioner] 19:48:08
 PLAN IN PLACE, SO
WHAT WOULD

[Captioner] 19:48:11
 HAPPEN IS, THERE
WOULD BE A PHASE II PRELIMINARY


[Captioner] 19:48:14
SITE ASSESSMENT, AND THAT WOULD
BE A

[Captioner] 19:48:19
 TARGETED -- A TARGETED
ASSESSMENT WITH SOIL

[Captioner] 19:48:23
 SAMPLING TO
ALLOW THE

[Captioner] 19:48:26
 TESTERS TO DETECT
EXACTLY WHAT'S OUT THERE,


[Captioner] 19:48:29
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW IT'S KIND

[Captioner] 19:48:32
 OF
BASED ON THE HISTORY OF THE
SITE, YOU

[Captioner] 19:48:36
 KNOW, THE

[Captioner] 19:48:39
 POTENTIAL
FOR AERIALLY DEPOSITED

[Captioner] 19:48:42
 LEAD,
POTENTIAL AGRICULTURAL USES IN
THE PAST.


[Captioner] 19:48:46
SO IT'S NOT A FOR SURE THING
THAT THERE IS ANYTHING

[Captioner] 19:48:49
 OUT
THERE, BUT THE TARGETED SOIL


[Captioner] 19:48:53
SAMPLING AND THE CORES THAT
WOULD BE TAKEN WOULD

[Captioner] 19:48:58
 ALLOW FOR A
REALLY TARGETED APPROACH.
AND

[Captioner] 19:49:01
 THE PRIMARY THING THAT THEY
WOULD

[Captioner] 19:49:05
 PROBABLY BE FINDING WITH
THAT TESTING OR THE PRIMARY
PURPOSE OF

[Captioner] 19:49:08
 THE TESTING WOULD

[Captioner] 19:49:11
 BE
TO ALLOW FOR SAFE DISPOSAL

[Captioner] 19:49:15
 OF
ANY SOILS THAT

[Captioner] 19:49:20
 ARE FOUND TO BE
CONTAMINATED.
>> Councilmember Cox: AND THAT


[Captioner] 19:49:22
COULD TAKE A NUMBER OF TESTING,
I GUESS, OVER THE TIME PERIOD
BECAUSE BENZENE HAS A PRETTY


[Captioner] 19:49:27
LONG LIFE IN STAYING IN THE
SOIL, AND ESPECIALLY IF

[Captioner] 19:49:30
 IT'S
COMING FROM ANY UNDERGROUND FUEL


[Captioner] 19:49:33
STORAGE TANKS OR OTHER THINGS
THAT HAVE BEEN THERE IN THE

[Captioner] 19:49:36
 PAST
HISTORY.
SO THIS COULD DELAY THE PROJECT


[Captioner] 19:49:39
IN TERMS OF THE

[Captioner] 19:49:42
 COMPLETION, IF
YOU HAVE TO CONTINUE TESTING AND
THEN I GUESS YOU'RE SAYING


[Captioner] 19:49:45
REMOVING THE SOIL, BECAUSE IT
COULD GO

[Captioner] 19:49:49
 DOWN DEEP INTO THE
GROUND, RIGHT?
AND

[Captioner] 19:49:52
 PROTECTING THE WATER

[Captioner] 19:49:55
 SUPPLY
THAT WOULD BE USED FOR THE LOCAL
COMMUNITY THAT IS

[Captioner] 19:49:58
 HOUSED AROUND
THAT AREA.
SO IT COULD BE A

[Captioner] 19:50:01
 LOT OF
EXTENSIVE WORK THAT COULD DRIVE
THE COST UP

[Captioner] 19:50:05
 ON THIS PROJECT.


[Captioner] 19:50:09
>> WELL, I'M NOT SURE THAT IT
WILL

[Captioner] 19:50:14
 NEED TO OCCUR ON A
RECURRING BASIS.


[Captioner] 19:50:17
I THINK THAT THE SOIL SAMPLING


[Captioner] 19:50:21
WOULD BE DONE TO

[Captioner] 19:50:25
 GET AN ACCURATE
SENSE OF WHAT IS OUT THERE, AND
THEN THAT WOULD ALLOW

[Captioner] 19:50:28
 YOU TO --
EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE NOT GOING TO
SAMPLE

[Captioner] 19:50:34
 EVERY SINGLE -- YOU'RE
NOT GOING TO TAKE A SOIL SAMPLE
AT EVERY SINGLE

[Captioner] 19:50:37
 PLACE WHERE
THERE'S SOIL DISTURBANCE, IT
WOULD ALLOW YOU

[Captioner] 19:50:40
 TO MAKE AN
EDUCATED GUESS AS TO WHETHER OR
NOT IT IS

[Captioner] 19:50:43
 CONTAMINATED AND THEN
ACT IN

[Captioner] 19:50:47
 A CONSERVATIVE MANNER TO
TREAT THAT SOIL WITH

[Captioner] 19:50:52
 CAUTION,
ASSUMING THAT IT IS CONTAMINATED
IF THAT'S WHAT THE

[Captioner] 19:50:55
 TESTING SAYS.


[Captioner] 19:50:59
SO THIS IS A

[Captioner] 19:51:04
 PRETTY STANDARD
TYPE OF REPORT AND PRETTY
STANDARD

[Captioner] 19:51:07
 APPROACH TO MITIGATION.
SO I'M NOT POSITIVE

[Captioner] 19:51:11
 THAT IT
WOULD RESULT IN DELAYS TO THE
PROJECT.


[Captioner] 19:51:16
>> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.
OR WE JUST DON'T KNOW YET UNTIL,
I

[Captioner] 19:51:19
 GUESS, YOU'RE SAMPLING IT.
AND I GET IT FOR THE

[Captioner] 19:51:23
 SAMPLING,
YOU DON'T TEST EVERYWHERE, JUST
IN INDICATED AREAS THAT

[Captioner] 19:51:25
 WOULD
MOST LIKELY, BUT MOST
IMPORTANTLY, TO PROTECT OUR


[Captioner] 19:51:29
COMMUNITY, PROTECT THE WORKERS,
PROTECT THE SCHOOLS THAT ARE


[Captioner] 19:51:34
NEARBY, YOU KNOW, FOR THE --

[Captioner] 19:51:35
 FOR
PROTECTING EVERYONE'S BEST
INTERESTS THERE.


[Captioner] 19:51:39
SO I WANTED TO ASK ABOUT THAT,
AND THEN THERE WAS SOMETHING


[Captioner] 19:51:42
WITH ELECTRICAL TRANSFORMERS.
DO THOSE HAVE TO BE

[Captioner] 19:51:46
 REMOVED IN
THAT AREA AS WELL?


[Captioner] 19:51:53
>> I'M NOT SURE, HANS, IF THAT'S
A QUESTION

[Captioner] 19:51:57
 FOR ME.


[Captioner] 19:52:02
>> LET ME REFER THIS TO

[Captioner] 19:52:11
 MIRABEL?
>> I'LL DEFER TO MIRABEL TO
BEGIN.


[Captioner] 19:52:15
>> GOOD EVENING, MAYOR AND
COUNCIL.


[Captioner] 19:52:18
COUNCILMEMBER COX, I'M NOT

[Captioner] 19:52:22
 AWARE
OF

[Captioner] 19:52:27
 ELECTRICAL VAULTS BEING
DISTURBED BY THE PROJECT.
JOHN, I DON'T

[Captioner] 19:52:30
 KNOW IF THERE'S
ANYTHING ELSE THAT

[Captioner] 19:52:33
 WE HAVEN'T
IDENTIFIED IN OUR PRELIMINARY
ENGINEERING EFFORTS.


[Captioner] 19:52:37
>> RIGHT, SO, YOU KNOW, WE'LL BE
OBVIOUSLY, YOU

[Captioner] 19:52:40
 KNOW, BRINGING
POWER TO THE STRUCTURE ITSELF,
AND

[Captioner] 19:52:45
 THERE'S ALSO A MID BLOCK
CROSSING ON FREMONT BOULEVARD
AND WE'LL HAVE A SIGNAL

[Captioner] 19:52:48
 THERE.
BUT AS WE BRING POWER TO THE


[Captioner] 19:52:51
LOCATION, OBVIOUSLY WE'RE GOING
TO BE COORDINATING WITH OTHER
UTILITIES

[Captioner] 19:52:54
 WITHIN THE
JURISDICTION.
WE'RE NOT AWARE

[Captioner] 19:52:57
 OF ANY CONFLICTS
RIGHT NOW THAT YOU'RE ALLUDING
TO, AND SO I'D

[Captioner] 19:53:00
 BE CURIOUS IF
THERE WAS

[Captioner] 19:53:04
 MORE INFORMATION
AVAILABLE, BUT THE IDEA WOULD BE
WHEN YOU BRING A BRIDGE FORWARD


[Captioner] 19:53:07
LIKE THIS, YOU'RE GOING TO WANT
TO LIGHT IT IN THE EVENING AND
YOU WANT TO MAKE

[Captioner] 19:53:10
 SURE THAT
THERE'S -- THE SIGNS ARE

[Captioner] 19:53:13
 LIT
AROUND IT AND ALL THAT TYPE OF
STUFF, SO WE HAVE BEEN WORKING


[Captioner] 19:53:16
CLOSELY WITH THE CITY AND
CALTRANS IN

[Captioner] 19:53:22
 REGARDS TO THE
LIGHTING ELEMENTS AND HOW WE'RE
BRINGING SOURCE POWER,

[Captioner] 19:53:25
 WE'VE
ACTUALLY COMMUNICATED WITH PG&E
ON MULTIPLE

[Captioner] 19:53:28
 OCCASIONS.
THEY'VE NOT BROUGHT UP ANY
CONCERNS IN REGARDS TO THE


[Captioner] 19:53:31
PROJECT, AND SO RIGHT NOW WE
FEEL LIKE WE'VE

[Captioner] 19:53:34
 WORKED OUT BOTH
THE RIGHT-OF-WAY AND UTILITY
NEEDS

[Captioner] 19:53:37
 FOR THE PROJECT IN A WAY
THAT WOULD SUIT THE PROJECT.


[Captioner] 19:53:43
>> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.
I GUESS AS JUST A WORD OF
CAUTION AND

[Captioner] 19:53:46
 MAKING SURE WITH THE
ELECTRICAL TRANSFORMERS THAT IT
HAS, I

[Captioner] 19:53:49
 GUESS, ITS OWN STANDALONE
HOPEFULLY AND NOT TIED TO OUR
HOSPITALS

[Captioner] 19:53:52
 OR TO OTHER COMMERCIAL


[Captioner] 19:53:58
BUSINESSES.
I'M DISCOVERING THAT IN SOME
OTHER AVENUES OF SOME

[Captioner] 19:54:01
 PREVIOUS
EXPERIENCE, SO THAT'S WHY I JUST
BROUGHT IT

[Captioner] 19:54:04
 UP, JUST TO KIND OF
PUT IT AS ON THE RADAR, AND IT
WAS

[Captioner] 19:54:08
 NOTED IN ONE OF THE MEETINGS
THAT WAS WITH THE

[Captioner] 19:54:11
 PAPERWORK THAT
WAS SUBMITTED, THAT'S WHY I
RAISE THAT

[Captioner] 19:54:15
 QUESTION, AND THE
DRAFTED MITIGATED

[Captioner] 19:54:18
 NEGATIVE
DECLARATION, AND IT TALKED ABOUT
IN THE RED THERE, ABOUT A COUPLE


[Captioner] 19:54:21
OF AREAS, AND THAT'S WHY I WAS
RAISING THAT QUESTION.


[Captioner] 19:54:26
SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO ALL
AND TEAM FOR

[Captioner] 19:54:27
 ANSWERING MY
QUESTIONS.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:54:33
>> THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
SEEING NO OTHER --

[Captioner] 19:54:36
 OH,
COUNCILMEMBER KENG, DO YOU HAVE
A CLARIFYING QUESTION?


[Captioner] 19:54:39
>> Vice Mayor Keng: YES.
I JUST WANTED TO ASK REAL QUICK
IF YOU

[Captioner] 19:54:43
 COULD SHARE WITH US

[Captioner] 19:54:45
 THE
POTENTIAL ESTIMATE OF THE TIME
LINES FOR THE NEXT STAGES?


[Captioner] 19:54:50
>> Mr. Larsen: YES,
COUNCILMEMBER

[Captioner] 19:54:54
 KENG.
SO THE WORK THAT WE HAVE TO

[Captioner] 19:54:58
 SORT
OF -- THE NEXT STEP AFTER,
ASSUMING WE

[Captioner] 19:55:01
 GET ENVIRONMENTAL


[Captioner] 19:55:06
CLEARANCE FROM THE COUNCIL HERE
TONIGHT, SO THE NEXT STEP IS TO
GET

[Captioner] 19:55:11
 FEDERAL CLEARANCE THROUGH
CALTRANS, WHICH WOULD BE IN
SPRING OF NEXT YEAR, AND THEN

[Captioner] 19:55:15
 WE
HAVE DESIGN WORK TO

[Captioner] 19:55:19
 COMPLETE,
AND THERE'S A COUPLE OF
PROPERTIES, PORTIONS

[Captioner] 19:55:20
 OF
PROPERTIES THAT NEED TO BE
ACQUIRED.


[Captioner] 19:55:24
SO THOSE WOULD BE THE ACTIVITIES
OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS.


[Captioner] 19:55:28
WHILE WE WORK TO TRY TO FIND
CONSTRUCTION MONEY FOR THE
PROJECT.


[Captioner] 19:55:31
SO WE'VE GOT ABOUT TWO MORE
YEARS OF WORK IN GETTING

[Captioner] 19:55:34
 THE
PROJECT SHOVEL-READY, SO TO
SPEAK, AND THEN

[Captioner] 19:55:38
 IF ALL GOES WELL
ON THE FUNDING SIDE, WE COULD
START

[Captioner] 19:55:41
 CONSTRUCTION IN

[Captioner] 19:55:44
 FALL OF
2024, AND IT WOULD TAKE
APPROXIMATELY THREE

[Captioner] 19:55:47
 YEARS TO
COMPLETE.


[Captioner] 19:55:50
>> Vice Mayor Keng: SOUNDS GOOD.
THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: I'M JUST GOING TO


[Captioner] 19:55:53
LET YOU KNOW, IT'S ALSO ON

[Captioner] 19:55:56
 HANS
SLIDE NUMBER 7.


[Captioner] 19:56:00
OKAY.
AT THIS TIME, IF THERE ARE NO
CLARIFYING QUESTIONS, I'LL TURN


[Captioner] 19:56:04
TO -- I'LL OPEN THE PUBLIC
HEARING.


[Captioner] 19:56:08
AND IF THERE'S ANY SPEAKERS ON
THIS?
>> Mr. Quintanilla: WE

[Captioner] 19:56:11
 HAVE ONE
SPEAKER.


[Captioner] 19:56:19
WILLIAM YRAGUI.
>> SPEAKING FOR MISSION

[Captioner] 19:56:21
 PEAK
CONSERVANCY.
THIS IS ACTUALLY A VERY GOOD


[Captioner] 19:56:24
PROJECT AND ONE WE SUPPORT,
EXTENSION OF THE GREENWAY

[Captioner] 19:56:25
 TRAIL
THROUGH FREMONT IS EXTREMELY
IMPORTANT.


[Captioner] 19:56:29
IT WILL REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT
FUNDING, AND I THINK THAT
FUNDING WILL BE AVAILABLE,

[Captioner] 19:56:32
 I
DON'T THINK MR. LARSEN

[Captioner] 19:56:35
 HAS HAD
ANY PROBLEM

[Captioner] 19:56:39
 GETTING PUBLIC
AGENCIES AND REGULATORY BODIES


[Captioner] 19:56:42
TO SUPPORT US.
SO WE'RE FULLY IN SUPPORT OF
THIS.


[Captioner] 19:56:46
THE GREENWAY TRAIL, THE
EXTENSION OF IT

[Captioner] 19:56:49
 FROM OAKLAND
THROUGH MILIPITAS IS ACTUALLY
QUITE IMPORTANT.


[Captioner] 19:56:52
THIS INCLUDES THE INVESTMENT OF


[Captioner] 19:56:55
FUNDING TO PURCHASE AND DEVELOP


[Captioner] 19:56:59
THE UNION PACIFIC CORRIDOR


[Captioner] 19:57:02
THROUGH FREMONT.
THAT'S A 2.7-MILE

[Captioner] 19:57:06
 LONG 60-FOOT
EASEMENT.
THE REASON THE

[Captioner] 19:57:09
 GREENWAY TRAIL IS
IMPORTANT IS BECAUSE WE NEED
THAT

[Captioner] 19:57:12
 NORTH/SOUTH TRAIL THAT
ALLOWS PEOPLE TO STAY OFF THE


[Captioner] 19:57:16
STREETS, A COMBINATION OF
VEHICULAR TRAFFIC,

[Captioner] 19:57:19
 PEDESTRIANS,
CREATES PROBLEMS.
WE'VE HAD SEVEN DEATHS

[Captioner] 19:57:22
 IN
FREMONT FROM PEDESTRIANS GETTING
HIT BY CARS

[Captioner] 19:57:26
 THIS YEAR.
THE ONLY WAY TO PREVENT THAT IS
TO

[Captioner] 19:57:29
 SEPARATE PEDESTRIAN TRAFFIC
FROM VEHICULAR TRAFFIC.
SO THAT IS

[Captioner] 19:57:32
 WHAT THE GREENWAY
TRAIL, THE DESIGN S

[Captioner] 19:57:35
 THIS IS A


[Captioner] 19:57:38
PEDESTRIAN BICYCLING BRIDGE.
WE FULLY SUPPORT IT AND WE


[Captioner] 19:57:42
COMMEND HANS LARSEN FOR HAVING
THE SCITION TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN.

[Captioner] 19:57:46
 VISION TO MAKE

[Captioner] 19:57:48
 THIS HAPPEN.
THANK YOU.
>> Mr. Quintanilla: NEXT SPEAKER


[Captioner] 19:57:51
IS STEVE SCALA.
>> Mayor Mei: WELCOME, STEVE.
>> THANK

[Captioner] 19:57:54
 YOU, MAYOR, COUNCIL.
JUST LIKE TO POINT

[Captioner] 19:57:58
 OUT AFTER
MANY, MANY YEARS OF DRIVING
AROUND THE BAY AREA AND

[Captioner] 19:58:02
 SEEING
PEDESTRIAN BICYCLE OVERPASSES


[Captioner] 19:58:05
ACROSS MANY

[Captioner] 19:58:08
 HIGHWAYS, SUNNYVALE,
HAYWARD, UP

[Captioner] 19:58:13
 NORTH, INCLUDING A
BRIDGE

[Captioner] 19:58:16
 SIMILAR IN CUPERTINO,
WHICH LIKE THIS

[Captioner] 19:58:19
 LOCATION, WAS A
VERY WIDE

[Captioner] 19:58:23
 SPAN, AND IS A SIMILAR
CABLE TAI BRIDGE.


[Captioner] 19:58:28
I'D SAY IT'S REALLY NICE TO SEE
FREMONT CATCHING UP

[Captioner] 19:58:31
 WITH THE
REST OF THE BAY AREA, AS THIS
WOULD BE OUR FIRST

[Captioner] 19:58:35
 PEDESTRIAN
OVERPASS OVER A MAJOR

[Captioner] 19:58:37
 HIGHWAY,
SO I HOPE THIS PROJECT CAN MOVE
FORWARD.


[Captioner] 19:58:42
AND THE ONE OTHER COMMENT I'LL
JUST MAKE, I'M

[Captioner] 19:58:47
 SURE THAT
MR. LARSEN AND THE

[Captioner] 19:58:50
 STAFF WILL
TAKE POINT, BUT THIS BRIDGE ALSO
IS REASONABLY

[Captioner] 19:58:54
 CLOSE TO WARREN
AVENUE,

[Captioner] 19:58:57
 WHICH HAS AN APPROACH
FROM THE SOUTH ALONG KATO, WHICH
MEANS

[Captioner] 19:59:00
 THAT PEOPLE USING THIS
BRIDGE AS AN

[Captioner] 19:59:05
 ALTERNATE WILL HAVE
TO CROSS KATO, WHICH HAS BECOME
VERY,

[Captioner] 19:59:08
 VERY BUSY RECENTLY WITH
TESLA, SO I HOPE THE

[Captioner] 19:59:11
 PROJECT
WILL INCLUDE A NICE WAY FOR
PEOPLE TO

[Captioner] 19:59:15
 APPROACH THE BRIDGE
FROM THE SOUTH ON KATO AS

[Captioner] 19:59:18
 WELL.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:59:26
>> Mr. Quintanilla: OUR NEXT
SPEAKER IS KELLY ABREU.


[Captioner] 19:59:29
>> THANK YOU.
IT SEEMS

[Captioner] 19:59:33
 LIKE WHENEVER PEOPLE IN


[Captioner] 19:59:36
FREMONT WANT TO TRY TO SABOTAGE
A PROJECT, THEY POINT

[Captioner] 19:59:39
 TO SOME
TOXIC WASTE

[Captioner] 19:59:42
 RAIL LINE
CONTAMINATION OR SOMETHING

[Captioner] 19:59:46
 THAT
IS ALONG THE PATH I

[Captioner] 19:59:49
 OF A PROPOSED
BICYCLE TRAIL.


[Captioner] 19:59:53
AND THAT HAS ALSO

[Captioner] 19:59:56
 BEEN TRIED IN
THE DOWNTOWN AREAS OF OTHER
CITIES IN THE TRI-VALLEY TO


[Captioner] 20:00:00
BLOCK HIGH-DENSITY LOW INCOME
HOUSING.


[Captioner] 20:00:03
THIS TOXIC WASTE, YOU

[Captioner] 20:00:06
 KNOW,


[Captioner] 20:00:10
TACTIC.
AND THIS, OF COURSE IT DOESN'T
REALLY HOLD A LOT OF

[Captioner] 20:00:13
 WATER, IT'S
NOT

[Captioner] 20:00:18
 REALLY TECHNICALLY VERY --
YOU KNOW, VERY SOLID WAY TO
BLOCK THESE

[Captioner] 20:00:21
 PROJECTS.
IF YOU LOOK AT THE IRON HORSE
TRAIL THAT RUNS THROUGH

[Captioner] 20:00:24
 THE SAN
RAMON VALLEY ALL THE WAY UP INTO
COULD

[Captioner] 20:00:27

CONCORD AND ALL WAY DOWN INTO
PLEASANTON FOR

[Captioner] 20:00:31
 LIKE 30 MILES,
THAT WHOLE THING IS A TOXIC
WASTE

[Captioner] 20:00:34
 LINE.
AND THEY WENT AHEAD AND

[Captioner] 20:00:39
 BUILT A
BIKE PEDESTRIAN TRAIL, THE IRON
HORSE

[Captioner] 20:00:42
 TRAIL, THAT IS THE CENTER
PIECE OF MANY OF THOSE
COMMUNITIES,

[Captioner] 20:00:46
 INCLUDING DOWNTOWN
DANVILLE, THEY'RE SO PROUD OF
THAT TRAIL.


[Captioner] 20:00:50
THEY LOVE THAT TRAIL.
AND IT'S -- YOU

[Captioner] 20:00:53
 KNOW, COMPLETELY
LINED WITH TOXIC WASTE, WHICH IS
WHAT

[Captioner] 20:00:58
 WAS -- WHAT THE RAILROADS
DID, AND THEY FOUND WAYS TO
MITIGATE

[Captioner] 20:01:01
 IT.
VARIOUS -- THEY REMOVED IT OR
CAPPED IT OR WHATEVER THEY

[Captioner] 20:01:04
 DO.
SO I'M SURE THAT THE CITY OF


[Captioner] 20:01:08
FREMONT WILL FIGURE OUT HOW TO
DEAL WITH THE TOXIC WASTE,

[Captioner] 20:01:11
 AND I
THINK WE NEED TO GET THESE
TRAILS BUILT

[Captioner] 20:01:13
 TO MAKE OUR CITY A
BETTER PLACE.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:01:19
>> Mr. Quintanilla: WE HAVE NO
ADDITIONAL SPEAKERS.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:01:23
AT THIS TIME, I'LL CLOSE OUR
PUBLIC HEARING.


[Captioner] 20:01:27
I WAS GOING TO SEE IF THERE'S
ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS FROM

[Captioner] 20:01:30
 OUR
COUNCILMEMBERS.
I SEE COUNCILMEMBER

[Captioner] 20:01:34
 SALWAN.
>> Councilmember Salwan: MADAME
MAYOR,

[Captioner] 20:01:36
 I'M READY TO MOVE THIS
FORWARD IF THERE'S NO FURTHER
COMMENT.


[Captioner] 20:01:39
>> Councilmember Cox: SECOND.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
I APPRECIATE THE SUPPORT.


[Captioner] 20:01:42
AND I WANTED TO SAY ALSO, OVER
THE PAST

[Captioner] 20:01:45
 COUPLE YEARS, WHETHER
IT'S FROM THE DESIGN AND SCOPE


[Captioner] 20:01:49
THAT ORIGINALLY HAPPENED, AND I
APPRECIATE THE

[Captioner] 20:01:52
 PROJECT TIMELINE
THAT'S BEEN ONGOING FOR SOME
TIME,

[Captioner] 20:01:56
 SINCE 2016, AND THE
PARTNERSHIP

[Captioner] 20:01:59
 WITH HANS AND ALSO
REPRESENTING

[Captioner] 20:02:02
 US ON THE ALAMEDA
COUNTY TRANSPORTATION
COMMISSION,

[Captioner] 20:02:05
 THE PARTNERSHIP
WITHIN THE COMMISSION TO ENSURE
THAT WE RECEIVE

[Captioner] 20:02:10
 THE $5.5 MILLION
GRANT, AND WORK ON THIS CONCEPT


[Captioner] 20:02:14
DESIGN AS WELL AS THE IMPORTANCE
OF GETTING BOTH THE

[Captioner] 20:02:18
 CEQA DONE
AND NOW THE NEPA IN

[Captioner] 20:02:21
 SPRING.
SO I AM VERY ALSO SUPPORTIVE OF
GETTING

[Captioner] 20:02:24
 THIS PROJECT MOVING
FORWARD AND I'M GLAD THAT WHEN
WE WERE

[Captioner] 20:02:28
 TALKING ABOUT PLAN BAY
AREA 2050, TO HELP

[Captioner] 20:02:31
 ADVOCATE, I
KNOW THE QUESTION CAME EARLIER


[Captioner] 20:02:34
FROM COUNCIL, I ALSO WANTED TO
MAKE SURE COUNCILMEMBER SHAO,
BECAUSE HE'S

[Captioner] 20:02:37
 REMOTE TODAY, I
DON'T KNOW IF HE HAD HIS
HAPPENED RAISED AT ALL, I WOULD


[Captioner] 20:02:40
CHECK WITH OUR CITY CLERK, BUT I


[Captioner] 20:02:44
KNOW THAT IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US
TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE

[Captioner] 20:02:47
 THESE
AMENITIES AS WE'RE LOOKING AT --
I

[Captioner] 20:02:50
 KNOW THERE WAS A SPEAKER
EARLIER TODAY TALKING

[Captioner] 20:02:54
 ABOUT HOW
WE WOULD LOVE TO SEE PEOPLE,
EVERYONE DOING JET

[Captioner] 20:02:58
 PACKS OR MEET
GEORGE

[Captioner] 20:03:02
 JETSORNTION BUT THIS IS A
WAY TO

[Captioner] 20:03:06
 PRIDE THE BIKE PEDESTRIAN


[Captioner] 20:03:09
ACTIVITY BUT TO MAKE A VERY
INTERESTING AND ALSO UNIQUE
SKYLINE

[Captioner] 20:03:12
 STATEMENT THAT WOULD
HELP CONNECT OUR COMMUNITIES.
I REMEMBER LOOKING AT

[Captioner] 20:03:16
 ALL THE
ORIGINAL THREE DESIGNS THAT WE
SAW BACK IN 2016,

[Captioner] 20:03:19
 AND THIS HAS
CERTAINLY EVOLVED.
AND SO IF WE

[Captioner] 20:03:22
 HAVE A MOTION AND A
SECOND, I'D LIKE TO ASK FOR A


[Captioner] 20:03:25
ROLL CALL, PLEASE.
AND IT WILL BE

[Captioner] 20:03:28
 A ROLL CALL VOTE
BECAUSE OF COUNCILMEMBER SHAO
BEING REMOTE.


[Captioner] 20:03:31
THANK YOU.
>> Mr. Quintanilla:COUNCILMEMBE
R

[Captioner] 20:03:36
 COX, COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN,
AYE.
COUNCILMEMBER SHAO,

[Captioner] 20:03:40
 AYE.
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, AYE.
COUNCILMEMBER

[Captioner] 20:03:43
 JONES, AYE.
VICE MAYOR KENG, AYE.
MAYOR

[Captioner] 20:03:46
 MEI, AYE.
SO I'M PROUD TO SAY THAT

[Captioner] 20:03:51
 THIS
PROJECT, IN TERMS OF ACCEPTING
THE STAFF'S

[Captioner] 20:03:54
 RECOMMENDATION TO
MOVE FORWARD WITH THE


[Captioner] 20:03:58
ENVIRONMENTAL -- APPROVING THE
ENVIRONMENTAL CLEARANCE, AND
THEN AS WE PROCEED

[Captioner] 20:04:01
 WITH THE NEXT
STEPS WITH FEDERAL, CALTRANS

[Captioner] 20:04:05
 AND
FINAL DESIGN, SEEKING FUNDING
AND LOBBIES TO

[Captioner] 20:04:08
 WORK ON THESE
EFFORTS WILL ALLOW US HOPEFULLY
TO BE ABLE TO

[Captioner] 20:04:11
 COME BACK AND BY
FALL OF 2024, MAYBE BE

[Captioner] 20:04:14
 MOVING
FORWARD ON THIS PROJECT.
SO I PROASHT ALL THE COUNCIL


[Captioner] 20:04:18
WORKING TOGETHER ON GETTING THIS
DONE.


[Captioner] 20:04:22
I'M SEEING

[Captioner] 20:04:25
 THE TIMELINE, AND I
THINK THIS NEXT ITEM WILL TAKE
MORE THAN 10

[Captioner] 20:04:28
 MINUTES, BECAUSE I
THINK WE'RE DUE FOR A BREAK AT
8:15?


[Captioner] 20:04:32
IF THAT'S CORRECT?
>> Mr. Quintanilla: CORRECT.
>> Mayor Mei: PERHAPS THIS IS A


[Captioner] 20:04:35
GOOD TIME FOR US TO PAUSE FOR A
QUICK FIVE-MINUTE

[Captioner] 20:04:38
 BREAK AND THEN
WE'LL COME BACK BECAUSE I KNOW
THAT THIS ITEM WILL DEFINITELY


[Captioner] 20:04:42
TAKE MORE THAN FIVE MINUTES OR
10 MINUTES.
SO WE'LL PAUSE

[Captioner] 20:04:45
 FOR A BREAK AND
WE'LL RETURN

[Captioner] 20:04:49
 ABOUT 8:10.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:06:15





[Captioner] 20:06:15





[Captioner] 20:11:07





[Captioner] 20:11:07





[Captioner] 20:15:27
>> Mayor Mei: GOOD EVENING.
WELCOME BACK TO OUR CITY COUNCIL
MEETING FOR

[Captioner] 20:15:30
 DECEMBER 6TH.
AND I'D LIKE TO RETURN TO
ITEM 5B, WHICH IS THE

[Captioner] 20:15:34

DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEE ANNUAL
REPORT AND PROPOSED INCREASE IN


[Captioner] 20:15:38
FEES, AND OUR PUBLIC WORKS
DIRECTOR HANS

[Captioner] 20:15:42
 LARSEN WILL
INTRODUCE THIS ITEM.


[Captioner] 20:15:44
>> Mr. Larsen: GREAT.
THANK YOU, MAYOR MEI AND MEMBERS
OF THE COUNCIL.


[Captioner] 20:15:48
I HAVE JUST SOME BRIEF VERBAL
COMMENTS AND WE HAVE A

[Captioner] 20:15:51
 STAFF
TEAM HERE READY TO ADDRESS ANY
QUESTIONS THE COUNCIL

[Captioner] 20:15:54
 HAS.
SO THE PURPOSE OF THE ACTIONS
FOR THIS ITEM ARE

[Captioner] 20:15:57
 TWOFOLD.
ONE, IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH


[Captioner] 20:16:00
STATE LAW UNDER THE MITIGATION
FEE ACT, THE CITY

[Captioner] 20:16:03
 MUST PRODUCE
AND HAVE COUNCIL APPROVE AN
ANNUAL

[Captioner] 20:16:07
 REPORT THAT DISCLOSES HOW
THE CITY IS USING ITS


[Captioner] 20:16:10
DEVELOPMENT IMPACT

[Captioner] 20:16:13
 FEES.
SO YOU HAVE THAT REPORT, IT PART
OF YOUR PACKET HERE

[Captioner] 20:16:16
 TONIGHT AND
WE RECOMMEND ITS APPROVAL.


[Captioner] 20:16:22
THE SECOND ACTION RELATES TO
ADJUSTING OUR DEVELOPMENT IMPACT
FEE TO

[Captioner] 20:16:25
 ACCOUNT FOR INFLATION.
BASED ON

[Captioner] 20:16:28
 PAST COUNCIL POLICY AND
LONG-STANDING

[Captioner] 20:16:31
 PRACTICE, THE CITY
HAS ANNUALLY ADJUSTED ITS
DEVELOPMENT

[Captioner] 20:16:38
 FEES TO ADJUST FOR
INFLATION REA LATED

[Captioner] 20:16:40
 TO
CONSTRUCTION COSTS.
JUST AS A REMINDER, THE PURPOSE


[Captioner] 20:16:43
OF OUR DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEES
IS

[Captioner] 20:16:47
 TO ALLOW FOR BUILDING
COMMUNITY

[Captioner] 20:16:51
 INFRASTRUCTURE THAT
SUPPORTS A GROWING POPULATION.
SO AS THE

[Captioner] 20:16:54
 CITY DEVELOPS, BOTH
JOBS AND HOUSING, WE HAVE

[Captioner] 20:16:59
 FEES
THAT ARE PART OF MITIGATION OF
THE IMPACTS OF DEVELOPMENT THAT


[Captioner] 20:17:03
SUPPORTS OUR COMMUNITY
INFRASTRUCTURE.
AND SO

[Captioner] 20:17:06
 THIS INCLUDES ADDING
SPACE AT OUR FIRE

[Captioner] 20:17:11
 STATIONS,
EXPANDING SPACE AT OUR POLICE
CENTER

[Captioner] 20:17:15
 TO SUPPORT GROWING PUBLIC
SAFETY

[Captioner] 20:17:18
 DEMANDS, ENHANCING OUR
TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE,


[Captioner] 20:17:22
AND THEN GROWING OUR PARK AND
RECREATION FACILITIES

[Captioner] 20:17:25
 TO RESPOND
TO THE NEEDS OF A GROWING
COMMUNITY.


[Captioner] 20:17:28
SO OUR TYPICAL PRACTICE HAS BEEN
AS

[Captioner] 20:17:34
 COSTS INCREASE TO BUILD THIS
INFRASTRUCTURE, WE ADJUST OUR


[Captioner] 20:17:39
DEVELOPMENT PLANS ACCORDINGLY.
NOW WE DO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS
YEAR

[Captioner] 20:17:43
 IS QUITE EXTRAORDINARY IN
THAT

[Captioner] 20:17:46
 THE INFLATION RATE THAT
AFFECTS CONSTRUCTION

[Captioner] 20:17:51
 COSTS IS
VERY HIGH THIS YEAR, SO BASED ON


[Captioner] 20:17:54
PUBLISHED SOURCES THAT QUANTIFY
CONSTRUCTION

[Captioner] 20:17:59
 COSTS FOR
INFRASTRUCTURE OF BUILDINGS AND
TRANSPORTATION

[Captioner] 20:18:03
 FACILITIES, THE
INFLATION RATE IS

[Captioner] 20:18:07
 13.65%.
SO WE HAVE USED THIS PUBLISHED


[Captioner] 20:18:10
RATE FOR THE BAY AREA AS A BASIS
FOR OUR ANNUAL

[Captioner] 20:18:16
 ADJUSTMENT.
I DO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT
THERE IS A LETTER ON

[Captioner] 20:18:19
 THIS TOPIC
FROM THE BUILDING INDUSTRY
ASSOCIATION, AND WE

[Captioner] 20:18:22
 PROVIDED
THAT TO COUNCIL FOR

[Captioner] 20:18:28
 YOUR
INFORMATION.
I DO WANT TO NOTE CERTAINLY THE


[Captioner] 20:18:31
COST OF DEVELOPMENT IS SOMETHING
WE'RE SENSITIVE TO, AND WE KNOW
THAT

[Captioner] 20:18:34
 THE COUNCIL HAS ESTABLISHED
A PRIORITY

[Captioner] 20:18:37
 TO SUPPORT AFFORDABLE
HOUSING.
JUST WANTED TO REMIND THE


[Captioner] 20:18:40
COUNCIL THAT THE FEE STRUCTURE
THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE

[Captioner] 20:18:43
 AND THAT
WOULD NOT CHANGE, HAS A

[Captioner] 20:18:46
 50%
REDUCTION ON OUR FEES FOR
AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS.


[Captioner] 20:18:50
SO THAT WOULD CONTINUE TO STAY
IN PLACE.


[Captioner] 20:18:53
SO THAT CONCLUDES OUR JUST
OPENING

[Captioner] 20:19:00
 REMARKS, AND

[Captioner] 20:19:02
 WE CAN
ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THE COUNCIL
HAS.


[Captioner] 20:19:06
THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU FOR THE
INTRODUCTION OF THIS ITEM FOR


[Captioner] 20:19:10
THE DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEE AND
THE ANNUAL REPORT AS WELL AS THE
PROPOSED INCREASE

[Captioner] 20:19:13
 IN FEES AND
THE CLARIFICATIONS FOR

[Captioner] 20:19:16
 THE
JUSTIFICATION OF THESE.
I WANTED TO TURN IT AT THIS TIME


[Captioner] 20:19:19
FOR THE COUNCIL FOR

[Captioner] 20:19:26
 QUESTIONS.
SEEING NO QUESTIONS

[Captioner] 20:19:29
 AT THIS
TIME, I'M GOING TO OPEN THE
PUBLIC HEARING AND ALLOW

[Captioner] 20:19:31
 FOR
SPEAKERS.
>> Mr. Quintanilla: OUR FIRST


[Captioner] 20:19:34
SPEAKER IS LISA DANZ.
>>

[Captioner] 20:19:37
 HI, THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:19:40
I'M SPEAKING TONIGHT BECAUSE I
BELIEVE THE SO

[Captioner] 20:19:44
 NAMED IMPACT FEE
DOESN'T TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THAT
NOT BUILDING HOUSING ALSO HAS

[Captioner] 20:19:46
 AN
IMPACT AND HAS A VERY NEGATIVE
IMPACT.


[Captioner] 20:19:49
WE ALL KNOW THE DOWN SIDES OF
THE HIGH COST OF

[Captioner] 20:19:52
 HOUSING.
SOME OF OUR NEIGHBORS GET PRICED
OUT TO FURTHER AWAY AND HAVE

[Captioner] 20:19:55
 TO
SPEW MORE CARBON DIOXIDE AS THEY
COMMUTE FURTHER

[Captioner] 20:19:58
 AND OTHER
NEIGHBORS GET PUSHED OUT
ENTIRELY AND

[Captioner] 20:20:01
 END UP ON THE
STREETS.
CHRONIC BUILDING STATEWIDE AND


[Captioner] 20:20:04
REGION WIDE ARE PART OF THE
REASON FOR THE HIGH HOUSING
COSTS AND

[Captioner] 20:20:06
 ADEQUATE HOUSING IS A
PUBLIC GOOD AND OUR POLICIES
SHOULD ENCOURAGE IT.


[Captioner] 20:20:10
THE MORE THAT WE DRIVE UP THE
COST TO BUILD, THE MORE IT
BECOMES UNTENABLE

[Captioner] 20:20:12
 TO BUILD
ANYTHING OTHER THAN HIGH COST
LUXURY HOUSING.


[Captioner] 20:20:16
AND SO I'M PRETTY CONCERNED THAT
THE PROPOSED FEE INCREASE IS TOO
HIGH.


[Captioner] 20:20:19
THANK

[Captioner] 20:20:25
 YOU.
>> OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS DENNIS


[Captioner] 20:20:28
MARTIN.


[Captioner] 20:20:32
>> GOOD EVENING, MAYOR AND CITY
COUNCIL.
DENNIS MARTIN SPEAKING

[Captioner] 20:20:35
 ON BEHALF
OF BIA BAY AREA.
I JUST

[Captioner] 20:20:38
 WANTED TO CALL YOUR
ATTENTION TO THE BIA LETTER THAT


[Captioner] 20:20:41
WAS FILED ON THIS

[Captioner] 20:20:45
 ISSUE.
AND RAISE OUR OBJECTION TO THE
HIGH RATE OF

[Captioner] 20:20:49
 FEE INCREASES THAT
FREMONT IS IS PROPOSING

[Captioner] 20:20:53
 PROPOSING HERE RMT
LET'S KEEP IN

[Captioner] 20:20:56
 MIND JUST LAST
YEAR, IN FACT TAKING EFFECT ON


[Captioner] 20:21:00
JULY 1ST, 2022, WAS A 6.6%
INCREASE,

[Captioner] 20:21:03
 COMBINED WITH THIS


[Captioner] 20:21:07
13.65% INCREASE, THESE IN
BASICALLY A CALENDAR YEAR

[Captioner] 20:21:10
 ARE
GOING UP 20%.
NOW THAT'S

[Captioner] 20:21:13
 UNPRECEDENTED AS FAR
AS I KNOW.


[Captioner] 20:21:16
AND THE CITY SHOULD REALLY -- I
HOPE THE CITY COUNCIL

[Captioner] 20:21:19
 REALLY
CONSIDERS WHETHER OR NOT A 20%
INCREASE

[Captioner] 20:21:23
 IN FEES IN A YEAR IS
THE

[Captioner] 20:21:26
 RIGHT POLICY FOR HOUSING IN
THE CITY OF

[Captioner] 20:21:30
 FREMONT.
SO WE'VE ASKED THAT ARE AT
LEAST, AT THE VERY LEAST,

[Captioner] 20:21:33
 THAT
THE CITY RETURN TO AND REINSTATE
THE

[Captioner] 20:21:38
 POLICY OF PAYMENT OF FEES,
IMPACT FEES AND OTHER

[Captioner] 20:21:44
 FEES AT
THE CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY
RATHER THAN A

[Captioner] 20:21:47
 BUILDING PERMIT,
AND THIS AT LEAST ALLOWS

[Captioner] 20:21:50
 THAT
THE DEVELOPER CAN AVOID
FINANCING THE

[Captioner] 20:21:53
 HIGH FEES THAT
FREMONT IS NOW CHARGING OVER THE


[Captioner] 20:21:57
COURSE OF THE BUILDING

[Captioner] 20:22:02
 PROJECT,
AND PAY THOSE ONCE CASH

[Captioner] 20:22:05
 IS BEING
REALIZED AT THE CONCLUSION OF
THE PROJECT.


[Captioner] 20:22:10
SO PLEASE CONSIDER THAT AS WELL
AS SOME OF

[Captioner] 20:22:14
 THE OTHER SUGGESTIONS
THAT WE'VE INCLUDED IN OUR


[Captioner] 20:22:17
LETTER, AND TAKE INTO ACCOUNT
THAT THESE FEES ARE AN OBVIOUS
STA

[Captioner] 20:22:25
 OBSTACLE
AND CONSTRAINT TO HOUSING AND
THE CITY COUNCIL NEEDS

[Captioner] 20:22:28
 TO TAKE A
LOOK AT THESE IN RELATION TO THE
HOUSING ELEMENT THAT THE

[Captioner] 20:22:31
 CITY IS
NOW PUTTING TOGETHER FOR THE
STATE.


[Captioner] 20:22:35
SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR
LISTENING TO MY

[Captioner] 20:22:38
 REMARKS, AND
GOODNIGHT.


[Captioner] 20:22:44
>> Mr. Quintanilla: WE HAVE

[Captioner] 20:22:47
 NOADDITIONAL SPEAKERS.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
AT THIS TIME

[Captioner] 20:22:50
 I'M GOING TO CLOSE
THE PUBLIC HEARING.
I'LL FIRST START -- AND I


[Captioner] 20:22:53
APPRECIATE BOTH THE SPEAKERS ON
THIS ITEM

[Captioner] 20:22:58
 AND THAT WE SHOULD
LOOK AT THE DIFFERENT IMPACTS.


[Captioner] 20:23:01
I DEFINITELY THINK THAT THERE IS
A CHALLENGE AT THIS TIME IN


[Captioner] 20:23:05
TERMS OF WHEN WE ARE GOING TO BE
HAVING AN UPCOMING

[Captioner] 20:23:08
 CONVERSATION
ABOUT THE

[Captioner] 20:23:11
 HOUSING ELEMENT AND
OUR GOALS IN TRYING TO DELIVER
THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF

[Captioner] 20:23:14
 HOUSING
AND AFFORDABILITY LEVELS.
AND ALSO

[Captioner] 20:23:17
 RECOGNIZING THE
FINANCING HAS BEEN BESIDES THE
MATERIAL COST AND LABOR

[Captioner] 20:23:21
 COST,
THE FINANCE PIECE HAS BEEN A KEY


[Captioner] 20:23:28
ASPECT.
I'VE READ THE LETTER AND SEEN
SOME OF THE DIFFERENT


[Captioner] 20:23:31
RECOMMENDATIONS.
I THINK WITH THE IMPACTS OF THE
GROWTH OF FEE, I'D BE

[Captioner] 20:23:34
 INTERESTED
IN LOOKING AT REINSTATING THE
IMPACT FEE DEFERRAL TO THE

[Captioner] 20:23:38
 TIME
OF THE CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY.
AND I THINK THAT

[Captioner] 20:23:41
 WOULD ALLOW
US -- I THINK ONE OF THE
CHALLENGES, SO MANY OF THE


[Captioner] 20:23:44
DEVELOPERS HAVE BEEN FACING IS
THE ABILITY

[Captioner] 20:23:49
 TO FINANCE SOME OF
THE FEE FOR A TIME PERIOD WHEN
YOU'RE NOT

[Captioner] 20:23:52
 ABLE TO HAVE THE
RECOGNITION OF THE REVENUE.


[Captioner] 20:23:55
SO THAT'S MY PERSONAL VIEW ON
THIS, BUT I'LL TURN IT

[Captioner] 20:23:58
 BACK TO
OUR COUNCIL FOR SOME OF THE
COMMENTS AND

[Captioner] 20:24:01
 DISCUSSIONS.
COUNCILMEMBER

[Captioner] 20:24:03
 KASSAN.
>> Councilmember Kassan: THANK
YOU.


[Captioner] 20:24:07
YOU KNOW, WE TEND TO

[Captioner] 20:24:10
 BUILD
MULTIPLES OF THE AMOUNT OF
MARKET

[Captioner] 20:24:13
 RATE HOUSING THAT IS


[Captioner] 20:24:18
CALLED FOR IN THE RHNA NUMBERS,
400% LAST TIME

[Captioner] 20:24:21
 I CHECKED.
AND THERE'S PLENTY OF ADDITIONAL
PROJECTS

[Captioner] 20:24:24
 BEING PROPOSED.
SO I

[Captioner] 20:24:29
 THINK THAT RIGHT NOW WE
DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH HAVING


[Captioner] 20:24:32
SUFFICIENT MARKET RATE HOUSING.
WHAT WE DO HAVE A PROBLEM WITH
IS

[Captioner] 20:24:35
 SUFFICIENT AFFORDABLE
HOUSING, AND AS WE KNOW FROM

[Captioner] 20:24:38
 OUR
NEXUS STUDY, EVERY TIME
ADDITIONAL

[Captioner] 20:24:41
 MARKET RATE HOUSING
IS BUILT IT CREATES THE NEED FOR

[Captioner] 20:24:45
MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING, SO
BUILDING MORE MARKET RATE
HOUSING ACTUALLY

[Captioner] 20:24:48
 DOESN'T SOLVE
THE PROBLEM, IT MAKES IT WORSE.
AND

[Captioner] 20:24:51
 THE REASON THIS IS GOING UP
ISN'T OUT OF ANY GREED, IT'S
THAT OUR

[Captioner] 20:24:54
 COST AS A CITY TO BUILD
WHAT WE NEED TO BUILD IS GOING
UP, AND SO OUR

[Captioner] 20:24:57
 FEES NEED TO
REFLECT THAT.
AND I DON'T SEE ANY

[Captioner] 20:25:01
 CRISIS
WHATSOEVER IN THE --

[Captioner] 20:25:04
 YOU KNOW,
THERE'S NO LACK OF BUILDING
MARKET RATE HOUSING

[Captioner] 20:25:07
 IN

[Captioner] 20:25:10
 FREMONT.
THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING GETS A
BIG

[Captioner] 20:25:13
 DISCOUNT AND GETS THE DEEFL,
SO I'M PERFECTLY HAPPY TO
SUPPORT THIS.


[Captioner] 20:25:16
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:25:25
>> Mayor Mei: ARE THERE ANY
OTHER COUNCILMEMBERS WHO WISH TO
SPEAK OR ADDRESS

[Captioner] 20:25:27
 THIS ITEM
BEFORE WE MAKE A DECISION ON THE
PROPOSED?


[Captioner] 20:25:31
COUNCILMEMBER JONES.


[Captioner] 20:25:34
>> Councilmember Jones: THANK
YOU, MADAME MAYOR.
SO I WOULD AGREE WITH YOUR


[Captioner] 20:25:37
SUGGESTION REGARDING THE
DEFERRAL OF FEES BECAUSE

[Captioner] 20:25:41
 THERE
IS A HUGE IMPACT

[Captioner] 20:25:44
 TO THE BUILDERS
AND NOT ONLY OF MARKET RATE
HOUSING BUT

[Captioner] 20:25:47
 OF AFFORDABLE
HOUSING AS WELL.
SO YOU

[Captioner] 20:25:55
 KNOW, IT'S -- AS A COUPLE


[Captioner] 20:25:58
PEOPLE MENTIONED, THIS IS KIND
OF AN UNPRECEDENTED INCREASE,


[Captioner] 20:26:01
THIS IS A VERY TRYING TIME FOR
EVERYONE, FOR

[Captioner] 20:26:04
 BUSINESSES,
DEVELOPERS, FOR REAL ESTATE, FOR
EVERYTHING YOU COULD IMAGINE


[Captioner] 20:26:06
WITH THE COST OF MATERIALS AND
LABOR AND EVERYTHING GOING
THROUGH THE ROOF.


[Captioner] 20:26:11
BUT I WOULD BE AGREEABLE TO THE


[Captioner] 20:26:14
SUGGESTION OF DEFERRING THOSE
FEES UNTIL THE CERTIFICATE OF
OCCUPANCY

[Captioner] 20:26:17
 IS ACTUALLY ISSUED.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:26:22
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
NEXT IS COUNCILMEMBER

[Captioner] 20:26:26
 KENG.


[Captioner] 20:26:29
>> Vice Mayor Keng: THANK YOU,
MADAME MAYOR.
I WOULD ALSO SUPPORT THE

[Captioner] 20:26:33
 MAYOR'S
SUGGESTION OF MAKING THE
DEFERRAL OF THE FEES

[Captioner] 20:26:36
 UNTIL THE
CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY.


[Captioner] 20:26:39
I THINK THE COSTS FOR
CONSTRUCTION OVERALL

[Captioner] 20:26:43
 HAS GONE UP
TREMENDOUSLY OVER THE LAST TWO,
THREE

[Captioner] 20:26:46
 YEARS, AND EVEN THE FEES
ARE GOING TO REFLECT IN

[Captioner] 20:26:49
 THE
FINAL PRICES OF

[Captioner] 20:26:52
 THE UNITS, AND


[Captioner] 20:26:55
MOST PEOPLE AREN'T ABLE TO GET
THOSE AFFORDABLE

[Captioner] 20:26:59
 HOUSING UNITS
OR EVEN IF THEY ARE IN THE
MIDDLE

[Captioner] 20:27:03
 INCOME, THEY'RE JUST
GOING TO HAVE TO SAVE UP AND

[Captioner] 20:27:07
 GET
IN LINE FOR WHEN THEY'RE READY
TO PURCHASE THOSE MARKET

[Captioner] 20:27:10
 RATE
HOUSING.
SO I WOULD BE HAPPY

[Captioner] 20:27:14
 TO SUPPORT
TO MAKE THE COST

[Captioner] 20:27:17
 FOR BUILDING
FOR THE BUILDERS A LITTLE LESS.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:27:24
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
NEXT IS COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN.
>> Councilmember Kassan: YEAH, I


[Captioner] 20:27:27
JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE IT'S
CLEAR, AND JUST TO REFRESH MY
MEMORY

[Captioner] 20:27:30
 IF I'M NOT

[Captioner] 20:27:33
 MISTAKEN, WE
DO HAVE THE FEE DEFEFERL 

[Captioner] 20:27:38
 DEFERRAL IN


[Captioner] 20:27:42
PLACE, SO IT WOULD JUST BE A
WIND FALL FOR

[Captioner] 20:27:45
 MARKET RATE FOR
FOR PROFIT HOUSING DEVELOPERS
AND

[Captioner] 20:27:49
 WOULD HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO
EFFECT ON

[Captioner] 20:27:50
 AFFORDABLE RATE
HOUSING DEVELOPERS.
IS THAT CORRECT?


[Captioner] 20:27:54
>> GOOD EVENING, MADAME MAYOR,
MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL.


[Captioner] 20:27:57
DAN

[Captioner] 20:28:08
 SHOWN HOLTZ.
UNDER STATE LAW,

[Captioner] 20:28:13
 NON-PROFIT --
DO QUALIFY FOR DEFERRAL OF
IMPACT

[Captioner] 20:28:16
 FEES UNTIL CERTIFICATE OF
OCCUPANCY.


[Captioner] 20:28:19
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
I ALSO WANTED TO CLARIFY THAT WE
AS A CITY IN THE

[Captioner] 20:28:23
 PAST SIX YEARS
HAVE BUILT AND WILL BE

[Captioner] 20:28:26
 HAVING
FURTHER CONVERSATIONS DURING THE
HOUSING ELEMENT, BUT RECORD


[Captioner] 20:28:29
NUMBERS OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING
AND PERHAPS, DAN, YOU COULD

[Captioner] 20:28:32
 ALSO
ANSWER THIS, BUT I THINK A LOT
OF THIS HAS BEEN

[Captioner] 20:28:35
 UTILIZING OUR
NOFA FUNDING POOLS, WHICH IS THE
NOTICE OF

[Captioner] 20:28:39
 FUNDING AVAILABILITY,
WHERE WE HAVE TAKEN THE POOL OF


[Captioner] 20:28:43
FUNDING FROM MARKET RATE HOUSING
THAT WE HAVE BEEN ABLE

[Captioner] 20:28:46
 TO
COALESCE TO THEN BE ABLE TO
OFFSET, AND I

[Captioner] 20:28:51
 THINK JUST LAST
WEEK OR AT OUR MOST RECENT
COUNCIL MEETING, WE

[Captioner] 20:28:54
 UTILIZED
SOME OF THOSE FUNDINGS TO BE
ABLE TO SUPPORT THE

[Captioner] 20:28:59
 FINANCING OF
ONE OF THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING
PROJECTS THAT I REMEMBER


[Captioner] 20:29:02
CORRECTLY OFF OF OSGOOD
RECENTLY, OR I'M TRYING TO


[Captioner] 20:29:05
REMEMBER, THERE WAS A COUPLE
PROJECTS THIS YEAR ALONE THAT
WERE PART

[Captioner] 20:29:09
 OF THE PACKAGE THAT WE
LOOKED AT FOR NOTICE OF

[Captioner] 20:29:12
 FUNDING
AVAILABILITY.
I THINK IT WAS 42 MILLION THAT


[Captioner] 20:29:15
WE APPLIED TO THREE OR FOUR
PROJECTS,

[Captioner] 20:29:19
 DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS
AT THAT

[Captioner] 20:29:22
 TIME.
COULD YOU PLEASE CLARIFY?


[Captioner] 20:29:26
>> Mr. Schoenholz: THANK YOU,
MAYOR MEI.


[Captioner] 20:29:30
FEES THAT WE COLLECT FROM THE
AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN LIEU

[Captioner] 20:29:34
 FEE
THAT'S ALLOWED UNDER OUR
AFFORDABLE HOUSING ORDINANCE

[Captioner] 20:29:37
 ARE
PROBABLY THE

[Captioner] 20:29:40
 PRIMARY SOURCE OF
FUNDS

[Captioner] 20:29:43
 FOR CITY SUBSIDIZED
AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN FREMONT.


[Captioner] 20:29:49
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
NEXT

[Captioner] 20:29:53
 IS COUNCILMEMBER COX.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:30:01
I'M SORRY, YOUR MIC IS OFF.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:30:05
>> Councilmember Cox: IS IT ON
NOW?
OKAY.


[Captioner] 20:30:08
>> Mayor Mei: YES.
>> Councilmember Cox: I JUST
WANTED TO, YOU

[Captioner] 20:30:11
 KNOW, INDICATE
THAT IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE
STILL PROVIDE HOUSING

[Captioner] 20:30:15
 AND
ESPECIALLY IN THE AREA OF
AFFORDABLE

[Captioner] 20:30:19
 HOUSING.
FOR THOSE IN OUR COMMUNITY.
AND WE CAN'T

[Captioner] 20:30:22
 STOP HOUSING


[Captioner] 20:30:25
TOTALLY, BUT WE CAN SLOW DOWN
THE IMPACT FEE.
AND I THINK

[Captioner] 20:30:29
 BASED ON WHAT WE'RE
SEEING AS A LOT OF

[Captioner] 20:30:33
 THE ECONOMIC
INDICATORS, YOU KNOW, IN THE
BUILDING TIED

[Captioner] 20:30:37
 INTO THE
MATERIALS, TIED INTO LABOR, TIED
INTO EVEN

[Captioner] 20:30:40
 FUEL CHARGES

[Captioner] 20:30:43
 AND
DELIVERY CHARGES THAT ARE
INCURRING AS BUSINESSES

[Captioner] 20:30:46
 HAVE TO
STILL MOVE

[Captioner] 20:30:50
 FORWARD AND WORK IN
THIS CLIMATE, THAT THERE'S SO
MANY DIFFERENT

[Captioner] 20:30:53
 ASSESSMENTS, AND
IT WOULD MAKE SENSE TO BE ABLE
TO

[Captioner] 20:30:57
 HAVE A CERTIFICATE OF


[Captioner] 20:31:01
OCCUPANCY AT THAT TIME TO THEN
ALLOW FOR THE IMPACT FEE TO

[Captioner] 20:31:04
 BE
INCURRED, AND

[Captioner] 20:31:08
 I THINK IT WOULD
JUST HELP IN TERMS OF HELPING
THE COMMUNITY, HELPING THOSE


[Captioner] 20:31:11
THAT NEED THE HOUSING,
ESPECIALLY THE AFFORDABLE
HOUSING, WOULD BE

[Captioner] 20:31:14
 A WIN-WIN.


[Captioner] 20:31:20
>> Mayor Mei: COUNCILMEMBER
JONES.
>> Councilmember Jones: THANK


[Captioner] 20:31:24
YOU, MADAME MAYOR.
SO BACK TO

[Captioner] 20:31:27
 MR. SCHOENHOLZ, JUST
TO CLARIFY, IF WE DID NOT HAVE
THE NOFA FUNDING THAT WE

[Captioner] 20:31:30
 HAD
AVAILABLE LAST YEAR, WE WOULD
NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO BUILD


[Captioner] 20:31:33
THOSE AFFORDABLE HOUSING
PROJECTS BECAUSE THE PARTNERS
THAT WE

[Captioner] 20:31:37
 PARTNER WITH DID NOT
HAVE THE SOURCE OF FUNDING
AVAILABLE OTHER THAN THE

[Captioner] 20:31:40
 MONEY
THAT CAME FROM OUR IN LIEU

[Captioner] 20:31:43
 FEES
FROM MARKET RATE HOUSING, IS
THAT

[Captioner] 20:31:47
 CORRECT

[Captioner] 20:31:49
?
>> Mr. Schoenholz: YES, THAT'S
CORRECT.


[Captioner] 20:31:52
MOST OF THE FEES WE MAKE
AVAILABLE DO COME

[Captioner] 20:31:55
 FROM MARKET
RATE RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT BUT
NOT ALL, BECAUSE WE HAVE A

[Captioner] 20:31:59
 JOBS
HOUSING LINKAGE FEE NOW AS WELL,
SO SOME OF

[Captioner] 20:32:02
 THOSE FUNDS ARE
GENERATED FROM COMMERCIAL AND
INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT.


[Captioner] 20:32:08
>> Councilmember Jones: THE
BOTTOM LINE IS, IF WE DID NOT
HAVE THE IN LIEU

[Captioner] 20:32:11
 FEES FROM
MARKETABLE HOUSING OR MARKET
RATE HOUSING,

[Captioner] 20:32:14
 THEN IT WOULD HAVE
AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON AFFORDABLE
HOUSING

[Captioner] 20:32:19
 PROJECTS?
>> Mr. Schoenholz: CORRECT, I


[Captioner] 20:32:24
MEAN, THE IN LIEU FEE, REMEMBER,
IS IN LIEU OF INCORPORATING
AFFORDABLE

[Captioner] 20:32:27
 HOUSING INTO MARKET
RATE DEVELOPMENTS, SO WE HAVE

[Captioner] 20:32:31
 AN
ORDINANCE THAT BASICALLY IS

[Captioner] 20:32:33
 AN
INCLUSIONARY HOUSING ORDINANCE
THAT REQUIRES DEVELOPERS TO


[Captioner] 20:32:39
INCLUDE SOME AFFORDABLE UNITS IN


[Captioner] 20:32:42
THE RESIDENTIAL PROJECT, BUT WE
PROVIDE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT


[Captioner] 20:32:45
ALTERNATIVES, ONE OF THEM BEING
WHAT WE CALL THE IN LIEU FEE,
AND THEY CAN

[Captioner] 20:32:48
 PROVIDE US FUNDS TO
THEN

[Captioner] 20:32:51
 PUSH OUT AND CONSTRUCT
AFFORDABLE HOUSING WITH THAT
MONEY.


[Captioner] 20:32:57
>> Councilmember Jones: JUST OUT
OF CURIOSITY, WOULD WE BE ABLE
TO

[Captioner] 20:33:00
 CONSTRUCT MORE UNITS WITH THE
IN LIEU FEES THAN WOULD

[Captioner] 20:33:03
 BE
PROVIDED FOR AN

[Captioner] 20:33:06
 ON SITE
INCLUSIONARY

[Captioner] 20:33:11
 HOUSING?
>> Mr. Schoenholz: THAT IS A
TOUGH QUESTION TO ANSWER.


[Captioner] 20:33:14
IT DEPENDS A LOT ON ECONOMIC
CONDITIONS AT

[Captioner] 20:33:21
 DIFFERENT TIMES.
WHEN WE SET THE FEE, WE TRIED TO
MAKE IT -- WE

[Captioner] 20:33:26
 LOOKED AT WOULD WE
BE DRIVING DEVELOPERS TO PAY

[Captioner] 20:33:29
 THE
FEE RATHER THAN INCORPORATE
UNITS IN THEIR

[Captioner] 20:33:33
 PROJECTS OR WHAT
WOULD BE DRIVING DEVELOPERS TO
INCORPORATE

[Captioner] 20:33:36
 UNITS RATHER THAN
PROVIDING A FEE, AND I THINK AT
THE TIME

[Captioner] 20:33:39
 WE THOUGHT IT

[Captioner] 20:33:42
 WAS
ABOUT, YOU KNOW, EQUAL, IT COULD
GO EITHER WAY.


[Captioner] 20:33:46
BUT I THINK OUR EXPERIENCE HAS


[Captioner] 20:33:50
SHOWN THAT DEVELOPERS TYPICALLY
TEND TO

[Captioner] 20:33:53
 CHOOSE THE IN LIEU FEE
RATHER THAN BUILDING THE ON-SITE


[Captioner] 20:33:56
UNITS.
I THINK IT'S JUST EASIER

[Captioner] 20:34:00
 FOR
THEM, AND THEY JUST --

[Captioner] 20:34:03
 THEY'VE
TENDED TO CHOOSE THAT OPTION.
>> Councilmember Jones: 

[Captioner] 20:34:06
OKAY.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:34:09
>> Mayor Mei: COUNCILMEMBER
SALWAN.
>> Councilmember Salwan: THANK


[Captioner] 20:34:12
YOU, MADAME MAYOR.
DAN, I WAS WONDERING IF

[Captioner] 20:34:15
 YOU
COULD REFRESH OUR MEMORY WHEN WE
STARTED

[Captioner] 20:34:19
 THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING
50% REDUCTION, WHEN WAS THAT?


[Captioner] 20:34:25
>> Mr. Schoenholz: SO THE 50%
REDUCTION WAS JUST

[Captioner] 20:34:29
 ADOPTED LAST
YEAR, WHEN THE COUNCIL

[Captioner] 20:34:34
 DID ITS
FIVE-YEAR UPDATE OF THE IMPACT
FEE PROGRAM.


[Captioner] 20:34:38
SO THAT WAS A MAJOR POLICY
DECISION.
PRIOR TO

[Captioner] 20:34:42
 THAT, AFFORDABLE
DEVELOPMENTS HAD PAID THE SAME
LEVEL

[Captioner] 20:34:45
 OF IMPACT FEES AS MARKET
RATE DEVELOPMENTS,

[Captioner] 20:34:48
 BUT BECAUSE
OF THE COUNCIL PRIORITY ON
AFFORDABLE HOUSING, THE

[Captioner] 20:34:52
 CLEAR
NEED IN THE COMMUNITY, THE
RELATIVE LACK

[Captioner] 20:34:56
 OF PRODUCTION OF
AFFORDABLE UNITS VERSUS MARKET
RATE

[Captioner] 20:35:00
 UNITS, COUNCIL DECIDED TO
LOWER THE

[Captioner] 20:35:03
 FEES FOR AFFORDABLE
PROJECTS.


[Captioner] 20:35:07
>> Councilmember Salwan: SO
WOULD YOU CHARACTERIZE IT AS AN
INCENTIVE FOR

[Captioner] 20:35:10
 AFFORDABLE
HOUSING?


[Captioner] 20:35:16
>> Mr. Schoenholz: YEAH, I GUESS
I WOULD.
I WOULD CHARACTERIZE IT AS A

[Captioner] 20:35:20
 WAY
TO MAKE AFFORDABLE

[Captioner] 20:35:23
 DEVELOPMENT
MORE ECONOMICALLY FEASIBLE.
>> Councilmember Salwan: OKAY.


[Captioner] 20:35:26
THANK YOU.
AND TO CARRY

[Captioner] 20:35:29
 COUNCILMEMBER
JONES' CONVERSATION, WHEN

[Captioner] 20:35:33
 YOU
BUILD IN LIEU FEES, DOES THAT
ALLOW

[Captioner] 20:35:36
 FOR MORE LEVERAGE OF CITY


[Captioner] 20:35:39
FUNDS TO LEVERAGE COUNTY, STATE,


[Captioner] 20:35:42
FEDERAL FUNDING TO GET LARGER


[Captioner] 20:35:45
PROJECTS THAN A DEVELOPER WOULD
BUILD BY HIMSELF OR HER

[Captioner] 20:35:51
 SELF?
>> Mr. Schoenholz: TYPICALLY
WHAT WE'VE SEEN IS THAT WHEN WE


[Captioner] 20:35:56
GET IN LIEU FEES, WE'RE ABLE TO
LEVERAGE STATE AND

[Captioner] 20:35:59
 FEDERAL AND
COUNTY DOLLARS AND

[Captioner] 20:36:02
 BUILD IS 100%
AFFORDABLE

[Captioner] 20:36:05
 PROJECTS, SO PROJECTS
THAT ARE ENTIRELY AFFORDABLE.
WHEN

[Captioner] 20:36:10
 DEVELOPERS DO INCLUSIONARY
UNITS, TYPICALLY IT'S MORE OF A


[Captioner] 20:36:13
MIXED INCOME KIND OF A
DEVELOPMENT, THEY

[Captioner] 20:36:17
 HAVE SOME
PERCENTAGE OF THE UNITS IN THEIR
PROJECT THAT ARE AFFORDABLE AND


[Captioner] 20:36:20
THE REST ARE MARKET RATE.


[Captioner] 20:36:23
SO THOSE KINDS OF PROJECTS DON'T
ATTRACT TYPICALLY THE SAME

[Captioner] 20:36:27
 KIND
OF EXTERNAL FUNDING AS

[Captioner] 20:36:30
 100%
AFFORDABLE PROJECTS.
>> Councilmember Salwan: SO DOES


[Captioner] 20:36:33
THAT ALLOW FOR MORE NUMBER OF
UNITS WHEN WE USE THE IN

[Captioner] 20:36:36
 LIEU
PROGRAM WHERE WE HAVE ONE LARGE
PROJECT

[Captioner] 20:36:40
 IN ONE PLACE COMPARED TO
JUST AN INDIVIDUAL BUILT

[Captioner] 20:36:42
 BY A
DEVELOPER?
>> Mr. Schoenholz: AGAIN, THAT'S


[Captioner] 20:36:46
A LITTLE TOUGH TO ANSWER, BUT
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE

[Captioner] 20:36:49
 NUMBERS, IT
LOOKS LIKE, YOU KNOW, SOMEWHERE
BETWEEN 10

[Captioner] 20:36:52
 AND 15% OF THE UNITS
BEING PRODUCED

[Captioner] 20:36:58
 IN FREMONT ARE
AFFORDABLE, AND THAT'S KIND OF
IN LINE WITH WHAT

[Captioner] 20:37:01
 OUR
INCLUSIONARY REQUIREMENT IS, SO
I DON'T KNOW THAT WE'RE


[Captioner] 20:37:05
PRODUCING MORE UNITS WITH THE
FEE THAN WE WOULD BE

[Captioner] 20:37:09
 OTHERWISE,
BUT I THINK WE ARE ABLE TO
ACHIEVE

[Captioner] 20:37:12
 DEEPER AFFORDABILITY
BECAUSE WE ARE ABLE TO

[Captioner] 20:37:16
 LEVERAGE
OUTSIDE FUNDS AND THE UNITS THAT


[Captioner] 20:37:19
WE'RE PRODUCING IN THESE 100%
AFFORDABLE PROJECTS

[Captioner] 20:37:22
 TYPICALLY
HAVE SOME COMPONENT OF EXTREMELY
LOW INCOME

[Captioner] 20:37:25
 OR VERY LOW INCOME
UNITS THAT WE WOULD HAVE A MUCH


[Captioner] 20:37:29
HARDER TIME GETTING AS
INCLUSIONARY UNITS.


[Captioner] 20:37:33
>> Councilmember Salwan: AND DO
THESE LARGER UNITS ALLOW FOR
WRAP-AROUND

[Captioner] 20:37:36
 SERVICES TO HELP THE
FOLKS LIVING IN THESE

[Captioner] 20:37:40
 AFFORDABLE
HOUSING UNITS?


[Captioner] 20:37:43
>> Mr. Schoenholz: YEAH, THE
100% AFFORDABLE PROJECTS, THEY
ALWAYS INCLUDE

[Captioner] 20:37:46
 SOME SERVICES,
THEY

[Captioner] 20:37:50
 OFTEN INCLUDE WHAT WE OFTEN
REFER TO AS

[Captioner] 20:37:53
 WRAP-AROUND SERVICES
WHERE THEY'RE REALLY

[Captioner] 20:37:57
 SERVING
PEOPLE AT THE LOWER END OF THE
INCOME SCALE WHO

[Captioner] 20:38:00
 MIGHT HAVE
CHALLENGES STAYING

[Captioner] 20:38:04
 HOUSED
WITHOUT THE SERVICES THAT ARE
PROVIDED AT THE PROJECT.


[Captioner] 20:38:10
>> Councilmember Salwan: THANK
YOU, DAN.
SO REGARDING THE MAYOR'S


[Captioner] 20:38:13
SUGGESTION ABOUT PAYING IMPACT
FEES AT THE TIME OF BUILDING
PERMITS,

[Captioner] 20:38:17
 HOW WOULD THAT AFFECT
CITY

[Captioner] 20:38:20
 POLICY OR FINANCES?
IS THAT A BIG CONCERN

[Captioner] 20:38:23
 FOR STAFF
OR IS THAT -- STAFF IS

[Captioner] 20:38:26
 OKAY WITH
IT?
WHAT'S THE FEEDBACK ON THAT, OR


[Captioner] 20:38:29
ANYBODY ELSE?
>> Mr. Schoenholz: MAYBE I'LL
START AND I CAN

[Captioner] 20:38:32
 TURN IT OVER TO
HANS TO TALK ABOUT MAYBE IN
TERMS OF HOW THE MONEY IS

[Captioner] 20:38:36
 USED
FOR PROJECTS.
IN TERMS OF THE

[Captioner] 20:38:43
 PROCESS, THE FEE
DEFERRAL SEGMENT OF THE

[Captioner] 20:38:46
 CODE,
IT'S A SEPARATE ORDINANCE, SO WE


[Captioner] 20:38:49
COULDN'T DO THAT TONIGHT.
WE'D HAVE TO BE

[Captioner] 20:38:52
 DIRECTED TO COME
BACK WITH AN ORDINANCE

[Captioner] 20:38:56
 AMENDMENT
AND SORT OF FOLLOW THE NORMAL
ORDINANCE

[Captioner] 20:38:59
 CHANGE PROCESS TO
REINSTITUTE THE

[Captioner] 20:39:03
 FEE DEFERRAL.
AND YOU KNOW, THAT WOULD TAKE US


[Captioner] 20:39:06
A LITTLE BIT OF TIME TO BRING
BACK.


[Captioner] 20:39:10
SO THAT'S SORT OF THE PROCESS.
MAYBE HANS CAN SPEAK

[Captioner] 20:39:13
 TO THE
IMPACTS

[Captioner] 20:39:16
 ON PUBLIC WORKS
PROJECTS.


[Captioner] 20:39:19
>> Mr. Larsen: YEAH, I THINK,
YOU KNOW, SO DAN, IF YOU COULD
JUST

[Captioner] 20:39:22
 ADD SORT OF WHAT'S
TYPICALLY THE LAG TIME BETWEEN


[Captioner] 20:39:25
WHEN WE WOULD COLLECT FEES INTO
THE CURRENT PROCESS

[Captioner] 20:39:29
 BASICALLY AT
BUILDING PERMIT TO

[Captioner] 20:39:33
 OCCUPANCY, I
MEAN, THAT WOULD BE

[Captioner] 20:39:39
 A PERIOD,
SORT OF A LAG PERIOD IN WHICH WE
RECEIVE THE REVENUE

[Captioner] 20:39:41
 THAT COULD
SUPPORT CAPITAL INVESTMENTS THAT
WE INCLUDE IN OUR BUDGET.


[Captioner] 20:39:45
SO I MEAN, THAT'S TYPICALLY A
YEAR

[Captioner] 20:39:51
 OR TWO?
>> Mr. Schoenholz: THE ORDINANCE
WE PREVIOUSLY HAD IN PLACE

[Captioner] 20:39:54
 THE
SPEAKER WAS ASKING TO BE
REINSTATED, IT OFFERED

[Captioner] 20:40:00

DEVELOPERS 18 MONTHS OF FEE
DEFERRAL

[Captioner] 20:40:04
 OR UNTIL CERTIFICATE OF
OCCUPANCY,

[Captioner] 20:40:07
 WHICHEVER CAME FIRST.
SO IT WAS BASICALLY AN

[Captioner] 20:40:11
 18-MONTH
DEFERRAL.
I THINK USUALLY THE FEES

[Captioner] 20:40:14
 WERE
DUE BEFORE CERTIFICATE OF
OCCUPANCY, MAYBE NOT ALWAYS, BUT


[Captioner] 20:40:18
I THINK 18 MONTHS WAS

[Captioner] 20:40:21
 THE
TYPICAL DEFERRAL TIME FRAME.


[Captioner] 20:40:29
>> Mr. Larsen: SO JUST TO
TRANSLATE THAT INTO IMPACT TO
OUR CAPITAL

[Captioner] 20:40:32
 PROGRAM FOR BUILDING
PROJECTS THAT ARE FUNDED BY
DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEES, SO


[Captioner] 20:40:36
THESE ARE COMMUNITY BUILDINGS,
PARK FACILITIES,

[Captioner] 20:40:39
 TRANSPORTATION
INFRASTRUCTURE.
SO THAT'S MONEY THAT'S NOT


[Captioner] 20:40:43
COMING INTO OUR BUDGETS THAT WE
COULD USE TO

[Captioner] 20:40:46
 DO PROJECTS, SO IT
REPRESENTS

[Captioner] 20:40:49
 A DELAY IN THOSE
KINDS OF IMPROVEMENTS THAT --
YOU

[Captioner] 20:40:52
 KNOW, THAT WOULD BE APPROVED
IN OUR CAPITAL PROGRAM,

[Captioner] 20:40:56
 AND THEN
ON OUR SIDE, YOU KNOW, THEN
WE'RE

[Captioner] 20:40:59
 FACING A HIGHER ESCALATION


[Captioner] 20:41:02
COST DUE TO THAT DEFERRAL.
SO THAT'S

[Captioner] 20:41:06
 THE POLICY TRADEOFF,
IS

[Captioner] 20:41:09
 ESSENTIALLY CAPITAL
IMPROVEMENTS THAT MITIGATE
IMPACTS OF

[Captioner] 20:41:12
 GROWTH COME LATER,
AND THEY'RE GOING TO

[Captioner] 20:41:15
 COST THE
CITY MORE TO IMPLEMENT

[Captioner] 20:41:18
 THOSE AS
OPPOSED TO GETTING THE

[Captioner] 20:41:20
 MONEY
UNDER KIND OF THE CURRENT
PROCESS.


[Captioner] 20:41:27
>> Councilmember Salwan: THANK
YOU.
HAS THERE BEEN ANY STUDIES DONE


[Captioner] 20:41:31
THAT, AS YOU INCREASE IMPACT
FEES, HOW

[Captioner] 20:41:34
 IT AFFECTS COST OF
HOUSING?


[Captioner] 20:41:41
>> Mr. Schoenholz: UM, SO THE
TURNER CENTER

[Captioner] 20:41:44
 AT U.C. BERKELEY
HAS DONE

[Captioner] 20:41:47
 STUDIES, AND THEY DO
INDICATE

[Captioner] 20:41:50
 THAT IMPACT FEES


[Captioner] 20:41:54
REPRESENT -- I DON'T WANT TO
QUOTE THE NUMBERS BECAUSE I
DON'T REMEMBER EXACTLY,

[Captioner] 20:41:57
 BUT YOU
KNOW, I THINK THEY REPRESENT
MAYBE 10

[Captioner] 20:42:00
 TO 15% OF THE TOTAL
COST OF HOUSING

[Captioner] 20:42:02
 IN SOME
COMMUNITIES.
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S THE CASE


[Captioner] 20:42:06
IN FREMONT OR

[Captioner] 20:42:12
 NOT.
THE LAST TIME WE DID A STUDY
LOOKING AT THE IMPACT OF FEES

[Captioner] 20:42:15
 ON
HOUSING DEVELOPMENT

[Captioner] 20:42:18
 WAS IN
ASSOCIATION WITH THE AFFORDABLE
HOUSING ORDINANCE, NOT THE


[Captioner] 20:42:21
IMPACT FEE ORDINANCE BUT THE
AFFORDABLE HOUSING ORDINANCE
WHEN WE WERE

[Captioner] 20:42:26
 LOOKING AT WHAT IN


[Captioner] 20:42:32
LIEU FEE MARKET RATE PROJECTS
COULD SUPPORT,

[Captioner] 20:42:35
 AND SO THAT WAS,
I DON'T KNOW, A YEAR AND

[Captioner] 20:42:38
 A HALF
AGO OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.


[Captioner] 20:42:42
AND THAT INFORMATION WAS

[Captioner] 20:42:47
 USED
TO -- YOU KNOW, IT WAS PART OF
THE DECISION-MAKING PROCESS

[Captioner] 20:42:49
 WHEN
COUNCIL ADOPTED THE IN LIEU
FEES.


[Captioner] 20:42:53
AND OF COURSE WE WERE USING --
WHEN WE WERE LOOKING AT

[Captioner] 20:42:56
 THE
FEASIBILITY, WE WERE USING
WHATEVER THE COST OF DEVELOPING


[Captioner] 20:42:59
HOUSING WERE AT THAT TIME, AND
THINGS HAVE

[Captioner] 20:43:03
 CHANGED, BUT WE
HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING MORE
RECENT THAN THAT.


[Captioner] 20:43:09
>> Councilmember Salwan: OKAY.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:43:14
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
NEXT IS COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN.
>> Councilmember Kassan: THANK


[Captioner] 20:43:17
YOU.
SO JUST TO

[Captioner] 20:43:21
 CLARIFY, YOU DID A
LOT OF OUTREACH ON THIS

[Captioner] 20:43:29
 TOPIC
AND IT WENT OUT TO QUITE A FEW
PEOPLE AND

[Captioner] 20:43:32
 I THINK WE ONLY GOT
ONE LETTER FROM THE BUILDING
INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION.


[Captioner] 20:43:35
DID ANYONE ELSE SEND IN A LETTER
OF CONCERN REGARDING THE

[Captioner] 20:43:38
 FEE
INCREASE OTHER THAN THE BUILDING
INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION?


[Captioner] 20:43:44
>> Mr. Larsen: NO, EVERYTHING
THAT WE'VE RECEIVED, WE'VE
SHARED WITH COUNCIL.


[Captioner] 20:43:48
>> Councilmember Kassan: OKAY.
SO IF I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY, WE


[Captioner] 20:43:53
HAVE ONE INTEREST GROUP THAT IS
EXPRESSING CONCERN AND ASKING US


[Captioner] 20:43:56
TO GIVE THEM AN 18-MONTH
DEFERRAL ON

[Captioner] 20:44:00
 FEES, WHICH RESULTS
IN AN 18-MONTH DEFERRAL ON

[Captioner] 20:44:03
 THE
CITY'S ABILITY TO DO CAPITAL
IMPROVEMENT

[Captioner] 20:44:06
 PROJECTS, WHICH WE
SAY ARE IMPORTANT TO US, AND
WHICH

[Captioner] 20:44:10
 ARE TAXPAYER-FUNDED.
AND SO

[Captioner] 20:44:13
 THIS COUNCIL SEEMS TO BE
SAYING THAT IT'S MORE IMPORTANT


[Captioner] 20:44:16
TO GIVE A FINANCIAL BREAK TO


[Captioner] 20:44:19
FOR-PROFIT DEVELOPERS THAN TO
ENSURE THAT OUR

[Captioner] 20:44:23
 TAXPAYERS ARE
PAYING THE LEAST

[Captioner] 20:44:26
 POSSIBLE AMOUNT
FOR CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS,
BECAUSE IF WE HAVE

[Captioner] 20:44:29
 AN 18-MONTH
DEFERRAL ON FEES, THAT RESULTS
IN HIGHER

[Captioner] 20:44:33
 COSTS, WHICH ARE COSTS
TO OUR TAXPAYERS.
SO I JUST WANT

[Captioner] 20:44:36
 TO MAKE SURE THAT
THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE REALLY
WANTING TO DO, THAT THERE

[Captioner] 20:44:39
 IS
SUCH A DESIRE TO ACCOMMODATE THE
REQUEST OF THE

[Captioner] 20:44:42
 BUILDING INDUSTRY
ASSOCIATION THAT WE'RE WILLING
TO DEAL WITH

[Captioner] 20:44:45
 HIGHER COSTS FOR
OUR OWN CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS
BECAUSE

[Captioner] 20:44:48
 OF THAT FEE DEFERRAL,
AND IF PEOPLE REALLY FEEL THAT
THAT'S THE

[Captioner] 20:44:51
 RIGHT DECISION TO
MAKE, THAT REALLY DOES CONCERN
ME.


[Captioner] 20:44:54
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:45:01
>> Mayor Mei: COUNCILMEMBER COX.


[Captioner] 20:45:16
>> Councilmember Cox: I THINK IT
WAS SOME IMPORTANT INFORMATION
BROUGHT

[Captioner] 20:45:19
 FORTH THAT IF WE LOOK AT
THE DELAY OF

[Captioner] 20:45:23
 OCCUPANCY OF 18
MONTHS WHICH I WAS NOT AWARE OF
WHICH IS WHY

[Captioner] 20:45:25
 WE'RE HAVING AN
OPEN DISCUSSION FOR EVERYONE TO
SHARE THIS INFORMATION.


[Captioner] 20:45:29
BUT IT'S JUST AN EDUCATION
AWARENESS OF THE

[Captioner] 20:45:33
 DECISIONS, OR
THE INFORMATION THAT WE NEED TO
SHARE BEFORE MAKING

[Captioner] 20:45:37
 A DECISION.
ONE OF THE OTHER THING I WANTED
TO UNDERSTAND

[Captioner] 20:45:40
 WITH THE WAY THAT
THE ORDINANCE IS

[Captioner] 20:45:44
 WRITTEN, AND I
KNOW TONIGHT IT

[Captioner] 20:45:48
 IS THE

[Captioner] 20:45:52
 ACTION IS
ASKING TO HAVE

[Captioner] 20:45:56
 A 13.65%
INCREASE, IS THERE SOME WAY THAT
THERE COULD BE A

[Captioner] 20:45:59
 LITTLE BIT OF
THE SMOOTHING OUT OF THE
INCREASE THAT

[Captioner] 20:46:03
 MAYBE WE COULD DO
HALF NOW,

[Captioner] 20:46:06
 THE FIRST HALF OF THE
YEAR, AND SECOND,

[Captioner] 20:46:09
 THE SECOND
PART OF THE YEAR?
I'M NOT SURE IF THAT WOULD BE


[Captioner] 20:46:12
SOMETHING THAT OUR CITY ATTORNEY
WOULD BE ABLE TO

[Captioner] 20:46:16
 RESPOND TO OR
IT WOULD BE SOMETHING

[Captioner] 20:46:19
 WITH OUR
FINANCE, SO I'M NOT SURE WHO
WOULD BE THE DIRECT ACTION

[Captioner] 20:46:22
 TO
OUR CITY MANAGER TO DIRECT THE
ATTENTION IN

[Captioner] 20:46:25
 ANSWERING THAT
QUESTION.


[Captioner] 20:46:31
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: THERE
IS A LEGAL RESPONSE TO THAT


[Captioner] 20:46:34
QUESTION BUT THE MORE IMPORTANT
MIGHT

[Captioner] 20:46:37
 BE THE FINANCIAL ASPECTS
OF THAT DECISION-MAKING SO


[Captioner] 20:46:40
BEFORE I RESPOND WHAT IS
POSSIBLE BECAUSE

[Captioner] 20:46:43
 OF PROCEDURAL
STEPS HERE, IT MIGHT BE GOOD FOR
STAFF TO RESPOND TO THE


[Captioner] 20:46:46
OPERATIONAL ASPECTS OF THAT
PROPOSAL.


[Captioner] 20:46:52
>> Mr. Larsen: I THINK WE'RE
HEARING SOME

[Captioner] 20:46:55
 INTEREST FROM
COUNCIL ON LOOKING AT SOME


[Captioner] 20:46:58
ALTERNATIVES HERE.
I THINK FROM STAFF'S
PERSPECTIVE, YOU KNOW, WE'RE


[Captioner] 20:47:01
KIND OF OPERATING UNDER PAST


[Captioner] 20:47:04
PRACTICE

[Captioner] 20:47:08
 IN COUNCIL DIRECTION TO
MAKE ANNUAL ADJUSTMENTS TO THE
FEES,

[Captioner] 20:47:14
 AND SO I THINK IF THERE'S
AN INTEREST FROM COUNCIL IN
DOING

[Captioner] 20:47:18
 SOMETHING DIFFERENT, WE'D
LOOK FOR DIRECTION FROM COUNCIL
ON WHAT THAT IS.


[Captioner] 20:47:21
SO I THINK COUNCILMEMBER COX,
YOUR

[Captioner] 20:47:25
 SUGGESTION IS A LITTLE BIT
DIFFERENT

[Captioner] 20:47:29
 APPROACH THAN
DEFERRING THE FEES TO OCCUPANCY.


[Captioner] 20:47:33
SO I THINK COUNCIL HAS A
DISCRETION

[Captioner] 20:47:36
 TO PROVIDE DIRECTION
ON HOW WE DEAL

[Captioner] 20:47:40
 WITH INFLATIONARY
ADJUSTMENTS,

[Captioner] 20:47:45
 SO ANYTHING OTHER
THAN WHAT

[Captioner] 20:47:49
 WE'VE RECOMMENDED, AND
I JUST WANT TO ALSO LET COUNCIL


[Captioner] 20:47:52
KNOW THAT THE

[Captioner] 20:47:56
 RECOMMENDED
INCREASE TO ADJUST FOR INFLATION
WOULDN'T TAKE PLACE

[Captioner] 20:47:59
 IMMEDIATELY.
AND SO AS INDICATED IN THE STAFF
REPORT, IT WOULD BE

[Captioner] 20:48:03
 EFFECTIVE IN
JULY OF NEXT

[Captioner] 20:48:06
 YEAR, SO WE'RE


[Captioner] 20:48:11
TAKING ACTION MORE THAN SIX
MONTHS IN ADVANCE, AND REALLY
THE PURPOSE OF THAT

[Captioner] 20:48:14
 IS TO DO TWO
THINGS.
ONE IS TO GIVE LEAD TIME TO

[Captioner] 20:48:17
 THE
DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY OF


[Captioner] 20:48:20
ADJUSTMENTS IN FEES, AND WE DO
KNOW THAT THERE'S A

[Captioner] 20:48:24
 LOT OF
PROJECTS THAT ARE IN THE
PIPELINE AND

[Captioner] 20:48:27
 SOME PROJECTS OF
KIND OF

[Captioner] 20:48:33
 KEEN INTEREST WE EXPECT
TO GET THROUGH THE PERMIT
PROCESS BEFORE JULY OF

[Captioner] 20:48:36
 NEXT YEAR
SO THEY WOULDN'T BE AFFECTED.
LEGALLY, WE HAVE 60

[Captioner] 20:48:39
 DAYS TO PUT
INTO EFFECT A FEE CHANGE,

[Captioner] 20:48:43
 BUT WE
PURPOSELY ARE DOING THIS, YOU


[Captioner] 20:48:49
KNOW, PROVIDE LONGER LEAD TIME
TO THE DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY IN
ORDER

[Captioner] 20:48:52
 TO PLAN AND MAKE
ADJUSTMENTS.


[Captioner] 20:48:55
THE OTHER BENEFIT OF DOING

[Captioner] 20:48:59
 THIS
NOW

[Captioner] 20:49:03
 IN THAT -- TO BETTER PLAN
FOR OUR CAPITAL

[Captioner] 20:49:07
 IMPROVEMENT
PROGRAM WHICH WE'LL BE TAKING TO
COUNCIL NEXT SPRING, SO HAVING


[Captioner] 20:49:10
SOME CERTAINTY TO WHAT OUR
DEVELOPMENT FEE INFRASTRUCTURE
IS

[Captioner] 20:49:13
 NOW ALLOWS US TO PLAN FOR
WHAT KIND

[Captioner] 20:49:16
 OF PROJECTS AND HOW
MUCH MONEY WE HAVE TO WORK WITH
IN

[Captioner] 20:49:20
 THE UPCOMING CIP CYCLE.


[Captioner] 20:49:23
SO WHAT WE'VE RECOMMENDED AND
WHAT WE'VE TRADITIONALLY DONE IS
TO

[Captioner] 20:49:26
 MAKE AN ANNUAL ADJUSTMENT SIX


[Captioner] 20:49:30
MONTHS IN ADVANCE PACED ON
PUBLISHED RATES.
IF WE

[Captioner] 20:49:33
 SMOOTH IT OUT OR DELAY IT,
IT WOULD MEAN BASICALLY LESS


[Captioner] 20:49:36
MONEY AVAILABLE FOR OUR CAPITAL


[Captioner] 20:49:41
PROGRAM TO DELIVER THE PROJECTS
THAT ARE MITIGATIONS FOR
DEVELOPMENT

[Captioner] 20:49:44
 IMPACTS.


[Captioner] 20:49:49
>> Mr. Schoenholz: HANS, IF I
COULD JUST ADD ON, IF COUNCIL


[Captioner] 20:49:57
WANTED TO FOLLOW STAFF
RECOMMENDATION REGARDING THE
INCREASE BUT ALSO WAS INTERESTED


[Captioner] 20:50:00
IN HAVING A

[Captioner] 20:50:03
 DISCUSSION ABOUT FEE
DEFERRAL AT A

[Captioner] 20:50:07
 LATER DATE, YOU
COULD TONIGHT ADOPT THE INCREASE


[Captioner] 20:50:10
EFFECTIVE JULY 1, 2023, AND

[Captioner] 20:50:13
 YOU
COULD ALSO DIRECT US TO

[Captioner] 20:50:18
 COME
BACK WITH OPTIONS FOR LOOKING AT
THE

[Captioner] 20:50:22
 FEE DEFERRALS, AND WE COULD
DO THAT WELL BEFORE THE

[Captioner] 20:50:26

JULY 1 IMPLEMENTATION DATE OF
THE

[Captioner] 20:50:29
 IMPACT FEE INCREASE.
SO THAT'S ANOTHER OPTION

[Captioner] 20:50:32
 IFTHAT'S OF INTEREST TO COUNCIL.


[Captioner] 20:50:42
>> Councilmember Cox:  -- MOVE
FORWARD WITH WHAT'S RECOMMENDED


[Captioner] 20:50:45
BUT THEN COME BACK WITH WHAT'S
THE MAGIC NUMBER, RIGHT, OF

[Captioner] 20:50:48
 THE
OPTIONS FOR THE IMPACT FEES,
WHETHER WE DO

[Captioner] 20:50:51
 THE WHOLE 13 OR DO
WE BREAK IT UP

[Captioner] 20:50:55
 OR -- YOU KNOW,
AND YOU CAN RUN THE

[Captioner] 20:50:58
 NUMBERS AND
KIND OF SHOW US A LITTLE BIT
MORE OF THE

[Captioner] 20:51:01
 BACKGROUND DETAIL OF
WHAT THAT WOULD ULTIMATELY MEAN


[Captioner] 20:51:04
IF WE DON'T TAKE THE ACTUAL FULL


[Captioner] 20:51:08
AMOUNT OF 13% STARTING

[Captioner] 20:51:12
 JULY 1ST,
BUT SMOOTHING IT OUT OR LOOKING
AT THAT, THAT WOULD BE

[Captioner] 20:51:13
 VERY
HELPFUL.
I APPRECIATE THAT OPTION.


[Captioner] 20:51:20
>> Mayor Mei: COUNCILMEMBER
JONES.
>> Councilmember Jones: THANK


[Captioner] 20:51:24
YOU, MADAME MAYOR.
SO

[Captioner] 20:51:27
 MR. SCHOENHOLZ, JUST TO
CLARIFY, THE FEE DEFERRAL IS A


[Captioner] 20:51:31
SEPARATE ORDINANCE AND WOULD
HAVE TO COME BACK AS AN
AGENDIZED ITEM AT

[Captioner] 20:51:34
 ANOTHER
MEETING, IS THAT CORRECT?
>> THAT'S

[Captioner] 20:51:37
 RIGHT.


[Captioner] 20:51:39
>> Councilmember Jones: SO WE
CAN PUT THAT PART OF TO BED.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:51:42
>> Mayor Mei: COUNCILMEMBER
SALWAN, DID YOU HAVE ANOTHER --
>> Councilmember Salwan: JUST TO


[Captioner] 20:51:45
MOVE THIS FORWARD, I THINK DAN


[Captioner] 20:51:49
SUGGESTED A GOOD SUGGESTION TO
GO AHEAD AND APPROVE

[Captioner] 20:51:52
 THE CURRENT
RECOMMENDATION BY CITY STAFF,
AND BRING BACK

[Captioner] 20:51:56
 THE OTHER ISSUES
ABOUT

[Captioner] 20:52:00
 DELAYED PERMITS OR
OTHER -- SORRY,

[Captioner] 20:52:04
 DELAYED FEES
PAID AT TIME OF OCCUPANCY OR
OTHER ALTERNATIVES AT

[Captioner] 20:52:07
 A LATER
DATE WITH DIFFERENT OPTIONS
PRESENTED BY CITY

[Captioner] 20:52:10
 STAFF, THAT WE
COULD HAVE IN A FUTURE MEETING.


[Captioner] 20:52:17
>> Mayor Mei: I APPRECIATE THE
MOTION AND SECOND.
I WANTED TO

[Captioner] 20:52:20
 CLARIFY THE COMMENTS
THAT HAVE BEEN MADE REGARDING
THE

[Captioner] 20:52:23
 DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FEES AT
THE TIME

[Captioner] 20:52:26
 OF THE BUILDING PER
MATE

[Captioner] 20:52:31
 PERMIT


[Captioner] 20:52:34
VERSUS TIME OF OCCUPANCY, OR IT
MAY BE

[Captioner] 20:52:37
 PERCEIVED OR ALLUDED TO
THE IDEA OF WE WERE LOOKING AT


[Captioner] 20:52:40
BUILDING EITHER WINDFALLS OR
MAKING A STATEMENT IN TERMS

[Captioner] 20:52:44
 OF
PREFERENCE FOR ONE TYPE OF
HOUSING OR ANOTHER,

[Captioner] 20:52:47
 THERE HAS
BEEN A TURNER STUDY THAT WAS
RELEASED BACK IN AUGUST

[Captioner] 20:52:51
 OF 2022
THAT TALKS SPECIFICALLY ABOUT
THE

[Captioner] 20:52:54
 COST TO BUILD NEW HOUSING
AND HOW IT KEEPS

[Captioner] 20:52:57
 RISING.
IN FACT, OUR STATE LEGISLATION
IS AIMING TO TRY

[Captioner] 20:53:00
 TO REVERSE THE
TRENDS,

[Captioner] 20:53:03
 THE UPWARD TRENDS THAT
IT

[Captioner] 20:53:07
 IMPACTS.
I WOULD ECHO

[Captioner] 20:53:12
 SOME OF THE --
WHILE THERE IS A NEED TO BUILD
AFFORDABLE HOUSING

[Captioner] 20:53:15
 AND THAT'S
WHAT OUR GOAL IS, THERE'S ALSO
THE LOST OPPORTUNITY COST

[Captioner] 20:53:18
 OF
BUILDING HOUSING, SO WHEN WE
HAVE BEEN

[Captioner] 20:53:21
 IN -- AND CHARGED WITH
TRYING TO BUILD MORE HOUSING,
PEOPLE MAY NOT

[Captioner] 20:53:25
 KNOW AND THEY'VE
SEEN THE HOUSING ELEMENT WHICH
WE'LL BE LOOKING

[Captioner] 20:53:28
 AT, ORIGINALLY
OUR NUMBERS FOR THIS MOST RECENT


[Captioner] 20:53:31
HOUSING ALLOCATION WAS ACTUALLY
CLOSE TO 17,000 FOR FREMONT.


[Captioner] 20:53:34
AND I KNOW THAT BECAUSE I

[Captioner] 20:53:37
 MADE
WEEKLY TRIPS UP TO ABAG

[Captioner] 20:53:41
 AND, AND
WE'VE BEEN ABLE

[Captioner] 20:53:44
 TO ADJUST THOSE
TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS WITH


[Captioner] 20:53:48
JOBS-HOUSING BALANCE, THE
JOBS-RICH ENVIRONMENT, THE


[Captioner] 20:53:51
TRANSIT-ORIENT DEVELOPMENT AND
OUR NUMBERS ARE

[Captioner] 20:53:55
 NOW 12,900.
BUT AT THE SAME TIME, I FEEL
THAT WITHOUT THE FINANCING


[Captioner] 20:53:58
THAT'S CRITICAL, AND THAT'S WHAT
THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT IN THIS
ARTICLE IN

[Captioner] 20:54:01
 AUGUST OF 2022, IS
THAT THE DRIVER OF

[Captioner] 20:54:05
 THIS COST
THEN RESULTS IN

[Captioner] 20:54:09
 HOUSING NOT
BEING BUILT, SO WHILE WE'RE
COUNTING ON THE FUNDING

[Captioner] 20:54:12
 FOR THE
CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROGRAMS, I
CAUTION THAT AT THE SAME TIME,


[Captioner] 20:54:15
IT'S NO THE JUST FOR THE BENEFIT
OF THE DEVELOPERS

[Captioner] 20:54:18
 OR THE
BUILDERS THAT ARE IN QUESTION,


[Captioner] 20:54:22
BUT IF NOTHING IS BUILT, THEN
NONE OF THOSE FEES

[Captioner] 20:54:25
 COME IN, AND
THEREFORE THE PROGRAMS THAT
YOU'RE TRYING TO

[Captioner] 20:54:28
 FUND, WHETHER
IT'S CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS AND
OTHER PROJECTS,

[Captioner] 20:54:31
 WILL SIMPLY NOT
GET BUILD, AND WE'VE CERTAINLY
EXPERIENCED

[Captioner] 20:54:34
 THIS MOST RECENTLY
IN THE DOWN

[Captioner] 20:54:37
 TREND, WHEN IT CAME
TO THE PANDEMIC AND BECAUSE OF


[Captioner] 20:54:40
OUR CITY'S THOUGHTFULNESS IN
TERMS OF FINANCING, AND I THINK


[Captioner] 20:54:44
FOR MANY BUSINESS OWNERS,
WHETHER IT'S THE DEVELOPERS

[Captioner] 20:54:47
 OR
EVEN THINGS LIKE WHEN WE LOOK AT


[Captioner] 20:54:50
COMMERCIAL PROJECT, THE THINGS
THAT PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR IS
FINANCIAL STABILITY

[Captioner] 20:54:54
 AND
UNDERSTANDING.
SO I'D

[Captioner] 20:54:57
 CAUTION THAT BESIDES
APPROVING FEET SCHEDULE, WHEN IT
COMES TO THE

[Captioner] 20:55:00
 PROPOSALS THAT ARE
GOING TO BE BROUGHT BACK TO US
IN TERMS OF

[Captioner] 20:55:03
 MITIGATION, WHETHER
IT'S THE ONES THAT WERE PROPOSED
BY THE BUILDING

[Captioner] 20:55:07
 INDUSTRY LETTER
THAT WAS SENT TO US OR THE
DIFFERENT

[Captioner] 20:55:10
 HYBRIDS, I THINK MOST
PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR

[Captioner] 20:55:13

STABILITY, CLARITY AND
UNDERSTANDING AND CONSISTENCY TO


[Captioner] 20:55:16
THEY CAN FINANCE AND BUILD THESE
PROJECTS IN A MANNER THAT

[Captioner] 20:55:20
 COULD
BE EASILY ADDRESSED.  SO I JUST
WANTED TO MAKE SURE

[Captioner] 20:55:24
 THAT THE
COUNCIL -- THE HYBRID OPTION

[Captioner] 20:55:27
 OR
THAT CONSISTENCY --

[Captioner] 20:55:30
 IF WE DO
HAVE TO INCREASE THE FEES, IN
RECOGNITION OF

[Captioner] 20:55:33
 THE FACT THAT
COST HAS GONE UP, WHETHER IT FOR
TRANSPORTATION, MATERIALS

[Captioner] 20:55:37
 OR
EVEN LABOR'S IMPACT, SO
THEREFORE, THIS

[Captioner] 20:55:40
 TYPE OF OPTION
TO ALLOW FOR THE INCREASE OF
FEES

[Captioner] 20:55:43
 TO ADDRESS OUR CONCERNS
WHILE AT THE SAME TIME LOOKING
AT THE

[Captioner] 20:55:46
 REALITY THAT WE AS A CITY
ARE ONLY LOOKING AT THE

[Captioner] 20:55:49

ENTITLEMENTS AND PLANNING BUT
NOT THE FINANCING WOULD

[Captioner] 20:55:52
 BE A
GOOD AND WISE, PRUDENT DECISION
AND

[Captioner] 20:55:56
 MORE PRAGMATIC.
AND SO I SEE THAT WE'VE HAD A


[Captioner] 20:55:59
MOTION AND A SECOND.
I DON'T KNOW IF ANY ONE WAS


[Captioner] 20:56:03
INTERESTED, IT SOUNDS LIKE IN
YOUR MOTION AND SECOND THAT YOU
BOTH

[Captioner] 20:56:06
 WANTED TO HAVE SOME
TIMELINE IN TERMS

[Captioner] 20:56:09
 OF BRINGING
BACK THE OPTION ABOUT THE


[Captioner] 20:56:14
FINANCING IN TERMS OF THE
ORDINANCE.
CAN I GET CLARITY FROM THE STAFF


[Captioner] 20:56:18
IN TERMS OF WHEN

[Captioner] 20:56:21
 IS THE TIMELINE
THAT YOU WOULD PROPOSE THE
ORDINANCE COMING BACK?


[Captioner] 20:56:24
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S FOR LEGAL
OR FROM DAN

[Captioner] 20:56:27
 OR HANS ON

[Captioner] 20:56:30
 THAT.
>> Mr. Schoenholz: I CAN TAKE A
GUESS.


[Captioner] 20:56:34
I THINK WE CAN PROBABLY BRING IT
BACK IN ABOUT THREE MONTHS.


[Captioner] 20:56:42
>> Mayor Mei: WOULD THAT GIVE US
TIME TO COINCIDE -- I KNOW RIGHT
NOW THE

[Captioner] 20:56:45
 HOUSING ELEMENT AND SOME
OF THE FEEDBACK THAT WAS
INSTITUTED FROM THE

[Captioner] 20:56:48
 STATE IS
RUNNING THROUGH THE PLANNING
COMMISSION.


[Captioner] 20:56:51
I THINK IT'S NEXT WEEK ON THE
AGENDA.
AND THEN IT WILL

[Captioner] 20:56:54
 BE COMING TO
US, AND I THINK WE HAVE A
TIMELINE, IF

[Captioner] 20:56:57
 I'M CORRECT, OF
JANUARY BY WHICH WE HAVE TO
RESPOND AND FILE

[Captioner] 20:57:00
 AND GET
SUBMISSION AND APPROVAL.
I KNOW THAT MOST RECENT

[Captioner] 20:57:03
 LETTER
THAT WE HAD FOR THE HOUSING
ELEMENT HAD SOME GENERAL --

[Captioner] 20:57:06
 I
THINK IT WAS THREE POINTS OF
CHANGE THAT THEY WANT US TO


[Captioner] 20:57:11
MAKE.
SO WOULD THIS GIVE US SUFFICIENT


[Captioner] 20:57:14
TIMING TO

[Captioner] 20:57:22
 OF THE HOUSING ELEMENT --
>> Mr. Schoenholz: 

[Captioner] 20:57:25
THE TIMING OF
THE HOUSING ELEMENT, WE HAVE

[Captioner] 20:57:27
 TO
SUBMIT TO THE STATE BY THE END
OF JANUARY AND WE'RE NOT GOING


[Captioner] 20:57:31
TO BE ABLE TO DO AN ORDINANCE
CHANGE BY THE END OF JANUARY.


[Captioner] 20:57:37
SO I THINK THE HOUSING ELEMENT
WILL

[Captioner] 20:57:43
 JUST REFLECT WHAT OUR
CURRENT POLICIES

[Captioner] 20:57:46
 ARE, IT CAN
IDENTIFY, I SUPPOSE,

[Captioner] 20:57:49
 THAT WE'RE
GOING TO BE LOOKING AT OUR FEE


[Captioner] 20:57:54
DEFERRAL REQUIREMENTS AND


[Captioner] 20:57:59
CONSIDERING WHETHER TO MODIFY
THOSE, BUT THE HOUSING ELEMENT
WILL HAVE TO BE

[Captioner] 20:58:03
 SUBMITTED BEFORE
COUNCIL IS ABLE TO HAVE

[Captioner] 20:58:06
 THE ITEM
REGARDING FEE

[Captioner] 20:58:09
 DEFERRAL, BEFORE
YOU'RE ABLE TO HAVE THAT
DISCUSSION AND MAKE THAT


[Captioner] 20:58:12
DECISION.


[Captioner] 20:58:16
>> Mayor Mei: HANS, COULD YOU
CLARIFY?
>> Mr. Larsen: I THINK IN TERMS


[Captioner] 20:58:20
OF THE PLANNING FOR THE CAPITAL
IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM, WE'RE


[Captioner] 20:58:23
PLANNING TO KIND OF HAVE OUR
KICKOFF MEETING WITH

[Captioner] 20:58:27
 THE CITY
COUNCIL IN MID MARCH.


[Captioner] 20:58:30
AND THEN THERE WOULD BE OTHER
ACTION

[Captioner] 20:58:33
 ITEMS, REVIEW ITEMS IN
MAY AND JUNE.


[Captioner] 20:58:38
SO DAN'S SUGGESTION OF COMING
BACK WITHIN 90 DAYS, I THINK,


[Captioner] 20:58:41
YOU KNOW, GETS DIRECTION IN
TERMS

[Captioner] 20:58:44
 OF FEE ESTIMATE.
A LITTLE LATER

[Captioner] 20:58:47
 THAN NORMAL, THAN
WE WOULD LIKE, BUT I THINK EARLY
ENOUGH IN

[Captioner] 20:58:51
 THE PROCESS THAT WE'RE
ABLE TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS.
SO I

[Captioner] 20:58:54
 THINK IF WEERL

[Captioner] 20:58:58
 -- IF

[Captioner] 20:59:01
 WE'RE BACK
WITH LOOKING AT SOME OPTIONS AND


[Captioner] 20:59:06
GETTING SOME -- BY MARCH, THAT
SHOULD BE FINE FOR A CAPITAL
PLANNING PROCESS.


[Captioner] 20:59:09
JUST TO CLARIFY, I THINK IF --
FOR STAFF, WHAT

[Captioner] 20:59:12
 WE'VE HEARD IS
KIND OF TWO OPTIONS FOR US TO
CONSIDER.


[Captioner] 20:59:18
ONE IS DEFERRAL OF FEE

[Captioner] 20:59:21
 PAYMENT
UNTIL OCCUPANCY OR I THINK AS


[Captioner] 20:59:24
DAN SUGGESTED, IT WAS 18

[Captioner] 20:59:27
 MONTHS,
WHICHEVER COMES FIRST, THAT'S
BEEN OUR PRACTICE IN THE

[Captioner] 20:59:30
 PAST IN
TERMS OF

[Captioner] 20:59:34
 CONSIDERING FEE
DEFERRAL, SO WE WOULD PROBABLY
COME BACK WITH THAT

[Captioner] 20:59:36
 AS ONE
OPTION.
AND THEN AS COUNCILMEMBER COX


[Captioner] 20:59:40
SUGGESTED, SOME KIND OF
SMOOTHING OUT

[Captioner] 20:59:43
 OF THE FEE, AND I
WOULD INTERPRET

[Captioner] 20:59:46
 THAT AS
SOMETHING -- LAST YEAR WHEN WE


[Captioner] 20:59:50
DID THIS AND, YOU KNOW, I JUST
WANT TO CLARIFY,

[Captioner] 20:59:54
 THIS IS NOT 6%


[Captioner] 20:59:57
PLUS 13, IT AN ADDITIVE, IT LIKE
EACH YEAR, THESE

[Captioner] 21:00:00
 ARE ANNUAL FEE
INCREASES EACH TAKING PLACE IN


[Captioner] 21:00:03
THE JULY TIME FRAME.


[Captioner] 21:00:10
SO I THINK THE THOUGHT WOULD BE
TO TAKE THE 13.65 AND MAYBE
SMOOTH THAT

[Captioner] 21:00:13
 OUT OVER A TIME


[Captioner] 21:00:16
PERIOD SAY WHERE PART OF THE
INCREASE HAPPENS

[Captioner] 21:00:21
 IN JULY AND
THEN ANOTHER PHASE INCREASE
HAPPENS IN,

[Captioner] 21:00:24
 SAY, DECEMBER AS A
WAY TO SMOOTH OUT THE INCREASE,
SO THERE ISN'T

[Captioner] 21:00:27
 SUCH A KIND OF A
ONE-TIME SORT OF SHOCK TO THE


[Captioner] 21:00:30
SYSTEM SO TO SPEAK.
SO THAT'S HOW I'M INTERPRETING


[Captioner] 21:00:34
WHAT WE'VE HEARD FROM COUNCIL,
IS THE TWO DIFFERENT SCENARIOS.


[Captioner] 21:00:37
IF THERE ARE OTHER IDEAS THAT
COUNCIL

[Captioner] 21:00:40
 HAS, WE WOULD LOVE TO
HEAR THOSE NOW.


[Captioner] 21:00:47
OTHERWISE WE'LL COME BACK WITH
SOME ANALYSIS BETWEEN THOSE TWO


[Captioner] 21:00:51
OPTIONS.
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: IF I
MAY,

[Captioner] 21:00:54
 MAYOR, JUST TWO TIME FRAMES
THAT COUNCIL SHOULD KEEP IN MIND
AS THEY CONSIDER

[Captioner] 21:00:58
 ANY ACTION THIS
EVENING.
ANY INCREASE TO A

[Captioner] 21:01:01
 FEE, YOU NEED
A 60-DAY PERIOD BEFORE IT'S
EFFECTIVE.


[Captioner] 21:01:05
AND IF WE ARE GOING TO CHANGE
THE FREMONT MUNICIPAL

[Captioner] 21:01:08
 CODE TO


[Captioner] 21:01:12
 WE'RE GOING TO NEED AT LEAST A 
45 DAY PERIOD

[Captioner] 21:01:15
 TO INTRODUCE AN 
ORDINANCE AND THEN ADOPT IT AND 
THEN

[Captioner] 21:01:18
 THERE'S A 30 DAY EFFECTIVE 
DATE SO WE'RE

[Captioner] 21:01:22
 REALLY TALKING A 
45 TO 60

[Captioner] 21:01:25
 DAY PERIOD, MINIMUM FOR 
ANY CHANGES.
>> Mayor Mei:  

[Captioner] 21:01:28
 THANK YOU, CITY 
ATTORNEY FOR

[Captioner] 21:01:31
 THE CLARIFICATION.
I ALSO KNOW THAT FOR SOME OF

[Captioner] 21:01:35
 OUR 
CONVERSATIONS, MOST RECENTLY, 
DAN

[Captioner] 21:01:38
 WE HAVE ABOUT SEARCH 
PROJECTS THAT ARE PENDING RIGHT 
NOW, SOME

[Captioner] 21:01:41
 OF THEM COMMERCIAL 
SOME OF THEM MIXED USE.
SO DO YOU THINK

[Captioner] 21:01:44
 THAT THIS COULD 
BE IMPACTING IN TERMS OF THE

[Captioner] 21:01:47
 
VIABILITY OF SOME OF THESE, OR 
THE ABILITY

[Captioner] 21:01:50
 TO DELIVER?

[Captioner] 21:01:55

BECAUSE I KNOW THAT FOR EXAMPLE 
MOST RECENTLY WE HAD

[Captioner] 21:01:58
 ANOTHER 
PROJECT THE

[Captioner] 21:02:02
 ISLANDER MOTEL THAT 
WE HAD BEEN ABLE TO

[Captioner] 21:02:05
 FINANCE 
THROUGHOUT SOME OTHER PROGRAMS 
AND EVEN SUPPORT FOR

[Captioner] 21:02:08
 SOME OF THE 
FINANCING, IT WOULD TAKE

[Captioner] 21:02:11
 A 
LITTLE BIT LONGER THAN HOPED FOR 
BECAUSE COST HAD

[Captioner] 21:02:15
 BEEN SUCH AN 
IMPACTING FACTOR, THIS

[Captioner] 21:02:17
 LAST YEAR 
AND A HALF ESPECIALLY DURING THE 
PANDEMIC.


[Captioner] 21:02:20
EVEN TODAY WHEN I WAS TALKING 
ABOUT SOME OF COMMERCIAL, I 
THINK A

[Captioner] 21:02:24
 LOT OF PEOPLE ARE NOW 
TRYING TO BECAUSE OF THE 
CONSTRAINTS

[Captioner] 21:02:27
 OF SUPPLY EVEN HAVE 
TO ADDRESS THOSE AHEAD OF TIME

[Captioner] 21:02:31
.
BECAUSE

[Captioner] 21:02:34
 OF THE LEAD TIME FOR 
MATERIALS

[Captioner] 21:02:37
 HAS SIGNIFICANTLY 
CHANGED.


[Captioner] 21:02:41
>> Dan Schoenholz:   ABSOLUTELY, 
A CHANGE IN DEVELOPMENT RIGHT 
NOW

[Captioner] 21:02:44
 WITH INFLATION AND INTEREST 
RATES, SUPPLY CHAIN

[Captioner] 21:02:48
 ISSUES AND 
THAT IS REFLECTED

[Captioner] 21:02:51
 BY THIS 13.5 
NUMBER

[Captioner] 21:02:54
, THAT'S WHAT'S DRIVING 
IT.
SO, YOU KNOW, I THINK

[Captioner] 21:02:57
 THE 
REALITY OF OUR COSTS INCREASING

[Captioner] 21:03:01
, 
AND OUR

[Captioner] 21:03:04
 NEED TO INCREASE FEES TO 
KEEP UP THAT IS AN EXPENSE THAT 
WE TRY

[Captioner] 21:03:07
 OPASS ON TO

[Captioner] 21:03:12
 NEW 
DEVELOPMENT, SO IT DOES, IT ADDS 
TO THE PRICE TAG

[Captioner] 21:03:15
.
YOU KNOW IT'S THESE 
MACROECONOMIC

[Captioner] 21:03:18
 CONDITIONS THAT 
WE'RE NOT IMMUNE TO, IT ALL

[Captioner] 21:03:21
 
PLAYS INTO DEVELOPMENT AND 
DEVELOPMENT IS TYPICALLY 


[Captioner] 21:03:24
CYCLICAL.
THERE ARE PERIODS WHERE 
DEVELOPMENT

[Captioner] 21:03:28
 IS NOT FINANCIALLY

[Captioner] 21:03:31
 
FEASIBLE AND THERE ARE PERIODS 
WHERE VERY

[Captioner] 21:03:35
 FEESIBLE AND THAT'S 
WHERE YOU SEE A LOT OF 
DEVELOPMENT HAPPENING.

[Captioner] 21:03:38

SO I DON'T KNOW IF THAT REALLY 
ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION BUT

[Captioner] 21:03:41
 IT 
BASICALLY I THINK COSTS

[Captioner] 21:03:46
 COST

[Captioner] 21:03:51
 INCREASES 
ARE TRINING

[Captioner] 21:03:55
 NOW PROFIT NONPROFIT 
AND GOVERNMENT.
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU FOR

[Captioner] 21:03:58
 
THE CLARIFICATION.
THERE IS A MOTION AND

[Captioner] 21:04:01
 SECOND, I 
DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S A 
DISCUSSION TO MOVE FORWARD

[Captioner] 21:04:05
, 
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, YOU HAD 
THE

[Captioner] 21:04:09
 BUTTON PUSHED.
>> Councilmember Kassan:   
BEFORE WE VOTE ON DOING

[Captioner] 21:04:12
 ANYTHING 
DIFFERENT THAN THE 
RECOMMENDATION WHEN IT DOES COME 


[Captioner] 21:04:15
BACK THAT WE DO GET A FULL 
REPORT FROM OUR

[Captioner] 21:04:19
 FINANCE 
DEPARTMENT ON THE IMPACTS OF 
OFFICIAL CHANGES

[Captioner] 21:04:22
.
YOU KNOW, I THINK WE NEED A LOT 
MORE INFORMATION ON

[Captioner] 21:04:25
 IT, 
SPECIFICALLY WHAT THE IMPACTS 
WOULD BE ON

[Captioner] 21:04:28
 OR CAPITAL BUDGET 
FOR ANY OF THE PROPOSALS THAT 
HAVE BEEN

[Captioner] 21:04:31
 MADE.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 21:04:35
>> Mayor Mei:   COUNCILMEMBER 
SALWAN.
>> Councilmember Salwan:   THANK

[Captioner] 21:04:38
 
YOU, MADAM MAYOR.
YES, AND I

[Captioner] 21:04:41
 THINK HANS WAS ASKING 
A QUESTION AND I THINK I

[Captioner] 21:04:44
 
PERSONALLY WOULD BE OPEN TO ANY 
STAFF RECOMMENDATION.


[Captioner] 21:04:47
MAYBE YOU HAVE SOME OUT OF THE 
BOX IDEAS THAT YOU CAN

[Captioner] 21:04:50
 BRING 
BACK.
SO THE WAY THAT I PERCEIVE IT IS

[Captioner] 21:04:53
 
THAT WE ARE MOVING STAFF 
RECOMMENDATION TODAY AND WE ARE 


[Captioner] 21:04:56
ASKING STAFF TO BRING BACK A 
COMPREHENSIVE DISCUSSION ON WHAT

[Captioner] 21:04:59
 
THE OPTIONS ARE, IF WE EXPLORE 
SOME OF THESE THINGS.

[Captioner] 21:05:02

RIGHT NOW WE HAVE NOT MADE ANY 
COMMITMENTS OR ANYTHING LIKE 


[Captioner] 21:05:07
THAT.
YOU KNOW, I'M ONE OF THE FEW 
FOLKS HERE THAT WAS ON

[Captioner] 21:05:10
 PLANNING 
COMMISSION IN 2010 AND I KNOW 
CHRISTINA

[Captioner] 21:05:14
 AND KELLY AND MANY 
OTHERS, BACK THEN FOLKS WERE

[Captioner] 21:05:16
 
BEGGING FOLKS TO COME IN AND 
HAVE PROJECTS.


[Captioner] 21:05:19
AND SO WE HAD ALL THESE HIGH 
FEES, WE

[Captioner] 21:05:22
 WERE GOING HOT IN 2008, 
AND WE HAD ZERO

[Captioner] 21:05:25
 PRODUCTS.
NOBODY WANTED TO BUILD IN 
FREMONT.


[Captioner] 21:05:28
AND SO THEY HAD TO CANCEL A LOT 
OF

[Captioner] 21:05:32
 THESE PLANNING COMMISSION 
TYPE MEETINGS.
SO AS WE LOOK AT THE

[Captioner] 21:05:35
 INFLATION 
AND THE RISING INTEREST RATE AND 
MAYBE A

[Captioner] 21:05:38
 POSSIBLE RECESSION IN 
THE HORIZON WE COULD HAVE ALL 
THESE HIGH

[Captioner] 21:05:41
 FEES BUT IF NOTHING 
GETS BUILT WE GET ZERO

[Captioner] 21:05:44
.
YOU KNOW?
SO I REMEMBER WE WERE DOING 


[Captioner] 21:05:48
INCENTIVE PROGRAMS, WE WERE -- 
CHRISTINA'S NODDING HER HEAD

[Captioner] 21:05:51
, WE 
HAD 50% OFF CERTAIN

[Captioner] 21:05:54
 AREAS, 
TRYING TO NERVOUS TO GET

[Captioner] 21:05:57
 NERVOUS

[Captioner] 21:06:01
 NERV

[Captioner] 21:06:04
 INCENTIVIZE TO GET 
SOMETHING

[Captioner] 21:06:07
 GUG.
I THINK THIS IS A GOOD 
DISCUSSION TO BE HAD, I

[Captioner] 21:06:10
 WELCOME 
THAT IN THE FUTURE.
BUT LET'S MOVE

[Captioner] 21:06:14
 THIS FORWARD.
>> Mayor Mei:   I SEE A

[Captioner] 21:06:17
 MOTION 
AND SECOND.
I

[Captioner] 21:06:21
 KNOW COUNCILMEMBER SHAO IS 
STILL ONLINE.

[Captioner] 21:06:26

>> COUNCILMEMBER COX, 
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN.

[Captioner] 21:06:29

AYE.
COUNCILMEMBER SHAO, AYE.

[Captioner] 21:06:32

COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, AYE.
COUNCILMEMBER JONES, AYE

[Captioner] 21:06:36
.
VICE MAYOR KENG.
AYE

[Captioner] 21:06:40
.
MAYOR MEI.
>> Mayor Mei:  

[Captioner] 21:06:43
 AYE AND THE 
MOTION PASSES, WE LOOK FORWARD 
TO THE CONVERSATION

[Captioner] 21:06:46
 AND 
DISCUSSION, I'M SURE STAFF HAS

[Captioner] 21:06:48
 
ADDITIONAL FEEDBACK FROM THE 
LEAGUE AND OTHER INDUSTRIES.


[Captioner] 21:06:53
NEXT, I'M LOOKING AT THE TIMING 
A LITTLE BIT WHICH IS HARD TO 
BELIEVE

[Captioner] 21:06:56
 THAT WE MIGHT BE NEEDING 
ANOTHER BREAK SOON.
BUT

[Captioner] 21:07:00
 WE'LL START THE CONVERSATION 
AT LEAST

[Captioner] 21:07:03
 WITH THE MISSION PEAK 
LEASE AGREEMENT

[Captioner] 21:07:07
 WITH EAST BAY 
REGIONAL PARK DISTRICT.

[Captioner] 21:07:10

AND OUR CITY MANAGER

[Captioner] 21:07:14
, KARENA

[Captioner] 21:07:19
 
SHACKELFORD WILL BE INTRODUCING 
THIS ITEM THIS

[Captioner] 21:07:22
 EVENING.

[Captioner] 21:07:26



[Captioner] 21:07:34
>> THANK YOU MADAM MAYOR

[Captioner] 21:07:37
.
AT THAT POINT YOU DID NOT -- YOU 
CHOSE TO

[Captioner] 21:07:41
 NOT APPROVE THE DRAFT 
AGREEMENT AND RATHER,

[Captioner] 21:07:44
 REQUESTED 
THAT STAFF RETURN WITH A WORK 
SESSION

[Captioner] 21:07:47
 TO REVIEW THE DRAFT IN 
DEPTH

[Captioner] 21:07:50
 FOR FURTHER NEGOTIATION.
SUBSEQUENT TO THAT

[Captioner] 21:07:53
 MEETING,

[Captioner] 21:07:59
 WE 
WERE NOTIFIED BY THE EAST BAY

[Captioner] 21:08:02
 
REGIONAL PARK DISTRICT THAT THEY 
ARE NOT WILLING TO NEGOTIATE ANY 


[Captioner] 21:08:06
FURTHER.
I THOUGHT IT PRUDENT TO BRING 
THAT INFORMATION BACK TO

[Captioner] 21:08:09
 YOU ALL 
ASAP AND ALSO REAFFIRM MY

[Captioner] 21:08:12
 BELIEF 
THAT THE DRAFT LEASE AGREEMENT 
AS PRESENTED

[Captioner] 21:08:17
 REPRESENTS GOOD 
STAFF WORK ON BOTH SIDES AND IS

[Captioner] 21:08:21
 
ALSO REPRESENTATIVE OF NEGOTIATE 
A

[Captioner] 21:08:24
 COMPROMISE BETWEEN BOTH SIDES.
HOWEVER WHILE I AM RECOMMENDING

[Captioner] 21:08:27
 
EXECUTION OF THE LEASE AGREEMENT 
I UNDERSTAND THE COUNCIL'S 


[Captioner] 21:08:30
CONCERNS AND THE CONCERNS 
EXPRESSED BY THE COMMUNITY WHICH

[Captioner] 21:08:33
 
IS WHY IN THE STAFF REPORT

[Captioner] 21:08:35
 
ALTERNATIVE OPTIONS ARE 
PRESENTED.


[Captioner] 21:08:39
FOR YOU TO CONSIDER AS WELL.


[Captioner] 21:08:42
I'LL LEAVE IT AT THAT AND TURN 
IT BACK TO THE

[Captioner] 21:08:45
 MAYOR.
AND I'LL ALSO JUST SAY THAT 
STAFF IS AVAILABLE FOR ANY

[Captioner] 21:08:48
 
QUESTIONS YOU ALL MAY HAVE.


[Captioner] 21:08:53
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.
WE'LL BEGIN WITH THE QUESTIONS

[Captioner] 21:08:56
 
FROM COUNCIL.
SO THESE ARE CLARIFYING 


[Captioner] 21:08:59
QUESTIONS.
WE'LL BEGIN WITH COUNCILMEMBER 
SALWAN.


[Captioner] 21:09:06
OKAY.
SORRY, THAT MAY BE FROM BEFORE.


[Captioner] 21:09:12
COUNCILMEMBER JONES.
>> Councilmember Jones:   THANK 
YOU, MADAM MAYOR

[Captioner] 21:09:15
.
JUST A QUICK QUESTION REGARDING 
A LINE IN THE

[Captioner] 21:09:18
 STAFF REPORT 
REGARDING A STUDY THAT WAS DONE 
IN

[Captioner] 21:09:21
 2014 ON WHAT IT WOULD COST US 
TO MAINTAIN THE

[Captioner] 21:09:25
 900 ACRES THAT 
IS CURRENTLY MAINTAINED BY EAST 
BAY

[Captioner] 21:09:28
 REGIONAL PARKS.
AT THAT TIME IT WAS ESTIMATED TO 
BE $1

[Captioner] 21:09:31
 MILLION, THAT WAS EIGHT 
YEARS AGO.
DO WE HAVE ANY

[Captioner] 21:09:34
 IDEA WHAT IT 
MIGHT COST US TODAY

[Captioner] 21:09:38
?
>> THANK

[Captioner] 21:09:41
 YOU FOR THAT QUESTION, 
COUNCILMEMBER JONES.
WE DON'T HAVE

[Captioner] 21:09:44
 ENOUGH UPDATED 
INFORMATION ON THAT.
THAT IS THE LAST INFORMATION WE 


[Captioner] 21:09:48
HAVE FROM THE NATIONAL PARKS AND 
RECREATION ASSOCIATION THAT 
IDENTIFIES

[Captioner] 21:09:51
 COSTS.
WE WOULD BE RECOMMENDING IF YOU 
WANTED US TO

[Captioner] 21:09:54
 LOOK AT THAT 
ALTERNATIVE TO HIRE A CONSULTANT

[Captioner] 21:09:57
 
TO ENGAGE IN A STUDY TO SEE WHAT 
THE ACTUAL COST WOULD BE FOR THE

[Captioner] 21:10:00
 
SITE BUS THAT GIVES US AN PRKS

[Captioner] 21:10:04
 
PROXTION

[Captioner] 21:10:13
 
APPROXIMATION TO WHAT IT WOULD 
COST AT

[Captioner] 21:10:16
 THAT SITE.
>> Councilmember Jones:   I WAS 
LOOKING FOR

[Captioner] 21:10:19
 A I THINK WE'VE

[Captioner] 21:10:22
 
REACHED POINT WHERE WE COULD 
MOVE THIS FORWARD.


[Captioner] 21:10:25
THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU

[Captioner] 21:10:28
.
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN.
CLARIFYING QUESTIONS.


[Captioner] 21:10:33
>> Councilmember Kassan:   YES, 
I WAS CONFUSED ABOUT

[Captioner] 21:10:35
 THE 
IMPLICATION THAT WE WOULD HAVE 
TO DO THAT.


[Captioner] 21:10:38
I MEAN WE HAVEN'T HAD A LEASE 
FOR QUITE A WHILE.
SO WAS THERE

[Captioner] 21:10:41
 A THREAT MADE,

[Captioner] 21:10:44
 THAT 
SOMETHING WOULD CHANGE FROM THE 
STATUS QUO

[Captioner] 21:10:49
?
OR, YOU KNOW, WHY WOULDN'T WE 
JUST CONTINUE TO

[Captioner] 21:10:52
 OPERATE AS WE 
ARE UNTIL SOMEHOW WE CAN

[Captioner] 21:10:55
 
EVENTUALLY REACH A INFLUENCE 
AGREEMENT

[Captioner] 21:10:59
?

[Captioner] 21:11:03

>> Karena Shackelford:   THERE 
WAS NO THREAT MADE AND THERE IS

[Captioner] 21:11:06
 
AN OPTION FOR US TO CONTINUE ON 
A MONTH TO MONTH BASIS.


[Captioner] 21:11:09
I THINK THE POINT OF POINTING IT 
OUT, THOUGH,

[Captioner] 21:11:12
 IS THAT EACH PARTY 
AT THIS POINT

[Captioner] 21:11:15
, AND THIS WOULD BE 
TRUE, I THINK, IF WE WERE IN

[Captioner] 21:11:19
 A 
FULL LEASE AGREEMENT BUT EACH

[Captioner] 21:11:22
 
PARTY AT THIS POINT HAS THE 
OPTION TO NOTIFY THE OTHER

[Captioner] 21:11:25
 
PARTY, WITH 30 DAYS, IF THEY 
WANT TO PULL

[Captioner] 21:11:29
 OUT OF THE TERMS OF 
THIS

[Captioner] 21:11:32
 AGREEMENT, A MONTH TO 
MONTH.
SO THAT IS AN OPTION.


[Captioner] 21:11:35
THERE WAS NO THREAT.
IT'S JUST, YOU KNOW, SOMETHING 
FOR YOU

[Captioner] 21:11:38
 TO CONSIDER.


[Captioner] 21:11:43
>> Councilmember Jones:   JUST 
TO CLARIFY, THE QUESTION WAS 
BASED ON ONE OF THE

[Captioner] 21:11:46
 OPTIONS THAT 
WAS LISTED.
IF IT WERE TO -- IF WE

[Captioner] 21:11:49
 WERE TO 
TERMINATE THE LEASE AND HAVE TO 
TAKE

[Captioner] 21:11:53
 OVER RESPONSIBILITY FOR 
THAT LAND.
SO I WAS JUST KIND

[Captioner] 21:11:56
 OF CURIOUS 
WHAT THAT WOULD LOOK LIKE.
NOT TO INDICATE

[Captioner] 21:12:00
 THAT C

[Captioner] 21:12:05
 THAT'S 
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU, I SEE 


[Captioner] 21:12:08
NO OTHER CLARIFYING QUESTIONS 
FROM THE COUNCIL.
AT THIS TIME

[Captioner] 21:12:11
 I AM GOING TO OPEN 
THE

[Captioner] 21:12:15
 PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD.
DO WE HAVE SOME SPEAKERS?

[Captioner] 21:12:18

I'M CERTAIN.
>> YES WE DO.


[Captioner] 21:12:21
THE FIRST SPEAKER IS SUE INKY.


[Captioner] 21:12:26
>> Mayor Mei:   CAN WE MAKE IT 
TWO MINUTES FOR EACH ONE

[Captioner] 21:12:30
.
>> YES, HELLO?
>> YES SUE

[Captioner] 21:12:33
.
>> YES, THANK YOU CITY, MAYOR

[Captioner] 21:12:36
 
AND CITY COUNCIL.
MEMBERS, FOR

[Captioner] 21:12:39
 ALLOWING US TO 
SPEAK.
AND

[Captioner] 21:12:42
 THIS IS REGARDING THE PARK

[Captioner] 21:12:46
 
AND

[Captioner] 21:12:50
 WE HAVE A FEW CONCERNS 
BECAUSE THE PARK IS OWNED BY

[Captioner] 21:12:53
 THE 
CITY, WHY IS THE CITY LETTING 
THE DISTRICT GET

[Captioner] 21:12:56
 AWAY WITH THE 
CITY WHEN THE CITY OWNS THE 
PROPERTY AND LEASES TO THE

[Captioner] 21:12:59
 
DISTRICT FOR FREE.
SO CITY MUST HAVE A SAY ON ABOUT

[Captioner] 21:13:02

A

[Captioner] 21:13:05
 THIS.
THEY CANNOT WASH THEIR HANDS ON 
THE

[Captioner] 21:13:09
 RESPONSIBILITY.
THE CITY DOES OWN THE ACRES FOR 
FREE AND

[Captioner] 21:13:11
 WE CANNOT GIVE IT TO 
THE PARK TO MAINTAIN IT WITHOUT

[Captioner] 21:13:15
 
SOME, YOU KNOW, AGENDA ITEMS 
THAT NEED

[Captioner] 21:13:18
 TO BE MENTIONED IN THE 
LEASE

[Captioner] 21:13:21
.

[Captioner] 21:13:24

WE NEED TO MENTION THAT IT IS 
ONE OF THE FREE PARKING, THIS 


[Captioner] 21:13:28
PARK HAS GOT FREE PARKING, IT IS 
MOST HEAVILY VISITED

[Captioner] 21:13:31
 AND ALSO, 
WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THERE'S NO 
PARK

[Captioner] 21:13:35
ING LOT STRUCTURE THAT WOULD 
BE BUILT.

[Captioner] 21:13:38

THIS PARK AS YOU KNOW IS AN OPEN 
SPACE

[Captioner] 21:13:42
 CONSERVATION PRESERVE.
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IF

[Captioner] 21:13:45
 
THERE'S, YOU KNOW, BECAUSE IF 
THERE'S A PARKING

[Captioner] 21:13:48
 LOT THE 
FLOODING IN THE DOWNSTREAM CREEK 
DOWNSTREAM

[Captioner] 21:13:51
 TOWARDS MANY HOMES 
AND WHO'S GOING TO TAKE THE 
RESPONSIBILITY FOR

[Captioner] 21:13:55
 THE CITY.
WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THERE'S 
ZERO

[Captioner] 21:13:58
 ENTRANCE FEE RIGHT NOW BUT 
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THERE'S

[Captioner] 21:14:01
 
THOUSANDS OF VISITORS PER DAY 
AND IT'S A FREE ENTRANCE

[Captioner] 21:14:04
.
THAT DOES NOT MAKE SENSE.
WE NEED TO

[Captioner] 21:14:08
 NEED TO MAKE SOME 
GATE AND CAMERAS AND

[Captioner] 21:14:11
 ENSURE 
VISITING HOURS, RESTRICT THE 
VISITING HOURS TO THE

[Captioner] 21:14:14
 PARK.
MAKE THE PERMIT PARKING

[Captioner] 21:14:17
, PERMIT 
PARKING A PERMANENT FEATURE

[Captioner] 21:14:21
.
THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO BE 
SENSITIVE

[Captioner] 21:14:24
 AND NO CHANGES TO BE 
MADE THEREAFTER.
CITY NEEDS TO

[Captioner] 21:14:27
 MAKE SURE THIS ALL 
MENTIONED IN THE LEASE AND IF

[Captioner] 21:14:32
 
THERE IS FIRE AND EVACUATION WHO 
IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT.


[Captioner] 21:14:36
>> OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS AJIT

[Captioner] 21:14:41
.

[Captioner] 21:14:50

>> HI, I'M ASSUMING YOU GUYS CAN 
HEAR ME

[Captioner] 21:14:54
.
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE LEASE 
MODIFIED BEFORE IT IS APPROVED

[Captioner] 21:14:57
.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 21:15:00
>> OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS IV

[Captioner] 21:15:03
Y E.


[Captioner] 21:15:10
IVY PLEASE UNMUTE.


[Captioner] 21:15:14
>> I'M HERE TO SUPPORT THE CITY 
COUNCIL MEMBERS FROAM TO SET

[Captioner] 21:15:17
 UP 
A SPECIAL COMMISSION TO ADDRESS 
CONCERNS

[Captioner] 21:15:21
 WITH PRETERMS IN THE 
LEASE TO THE EAST BAY REGIONAL

[Captioner] 21:15:24
 
PARKS COMMISSION BY THE CITY OF 
FREMONT.


[Captioner] 21:15:27
THE GOAL IS TO GIVE EQUAL 
PROTECTION TO MISSION PEAK

[Captioner] 21:15:30
 AREA 
RESIDENTS.
PROPOSAL

[Captioner] 21:15:37
PERFORMS IS A MEASURE TO

[Captioner] 21:15:40
 MAKE 
THE MISSION PEAK AREA SOUND

[Captioner] 21:15:43
 AND 
SAFE.
ANY

[Captioner] 21:15:47
 FUTURE CONSTRUCTION OF A

[Captioner] 21:15:50
 
PARKING STRUCTURE SHOULD BE, 
WITHIN FREMONT, SPEAKING

[Captioner] 21:15:55
 AREAS 
ENOUGH FOR PROMOTING THE 
TRAIL-WALKING.


[Captioner] 21:15:59
THIS NAKED WAS BOMBARDED WITH 
ATTACK

[Captioner] 21:16:03
 TO THEIR PARKING 
STRUCTURE DESPITE OUR

[Captioner] 21:16:06
 CONCERNS 
IN THE LAST TEN YEARS

[Captioner] 21:16:09
.
ENFORCE UNIFORM OPERATING

[Captioner] 21:16:12
 HOURS 
LIKE ANY STAGING HOURS IN 
FREMONT.


[Captioner] 21:16:15
STAGING HOURS SHOULD BE 
DECOUPLED FROM PARK HOURS

[Captioner] 21:16:18
 TO 
AVOIDED CONTROVERSIAL ARGUMENT

[Captioner] 21:16:22
 
OVER JURISDICTION.
I URGE OUR CITY MAYOR TO PUT

[Captioner] 21:16:26
 IN 
LEASE THE CLEAR TERMS.

[Captioner] 21:16:29

THIS IS A 20 YEAR LEASE THAT WE 
COULDN'T AFFORD TO GIVE

[Captioner] 21:16:33
 AWAY 
WITHOUT ANY LEGAL PROTECTION TO 
RESIDENTS IMPACTED

[Captioner] 21:16:36
 BY THESE 
ISSUES.


[Captioner] 21:16:46
>> OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS TONY

[Captioner] 21:16:49
 
PANG.


[Captioner] 21:16:54
>> GOOD EVENING.
I OPPOSE THE NEW MISSION PEAK

[Captioner] 21:16:58
 
LEASE WITH THE PARK DISTRICT.
GIVING PARK DISTRICT ANOTHER

[Captioner] 21:17:02
 20 
YEARS OF

[Captioner] 21:17:05
 FREE REIN IS A

[Captioner] 21:17:08
 BIG RISK 
AND RISKY.
THREATEN TO SUE THE

[Captioner] 21:17:11
 CITY EVERY 
DAY TO INTERFERE WITH FUTURE 
PARK

[Captioner] 21:17:15
 OPERATION.
DISTRICT WAS UNCOOPERATIVE 
DURING THE

[Captioner] 21:17:18
 HEIGHT OF THE 
PANDEMIC AND SOCIAL

[Captioner] 21:17:22
 DISTANCING 
WAS NECESSARY,

[Captioner] 21:17:25
 TO FAILURE TO 
CLEAN THE TOILETS.
BETTER

[Captioner] 21:17:28
 HUMAN WAYS AND 
TRANSMITTING INTO THE

[Captioner] 21:17:30
 
NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS AND 
SIDEWALK.


[Captioner] 21:17:33
THIS IS IRRESPONSIBLE AS IT 
CREATED ANNAL UN

[Captioner] 21:17:37
SAFE AND 
SANITATION ISSUE.
WHEN THE CITY TOOK THE

[Captioner] 21:17:40
 ACTION TO 
BLOCK THE STREET FOR PUBLIC 
SAFETY PARK

[Captioner] 21:17:43
 DISTRICT HAD THE 
AUDACITY

[Captioner] 21:17:46
 TO CRY FOUL.
SUCH HUE

[Captioner] 21:17:51
 HUBRIS IS

[Captioner] 21:17:56
 ASTOUNDING.
MAYOR MEI PENNED A LETTER TO

[Captioner] 21:17:58
 
DISTRICT TO CONVINCE THEM NOT 
TO.


[Captioner] 21:18:01
THAT IS IMPORTANT TO RETAIN THIS 
RIGHT TO DO SO, MOVING FORWARD.


[Captioner] 21:18:07
LACK OF OVERSIGHT IS ALWAYS 
PROBLEMATIC

[Captioner] 21:18:11
.
WHETHER A LEASE OF 5 YEARS 
SUBJECT

[Captioner] 21:18:14
 TO REVIEW AFTER THAT IS 
MORE PRUDENT.
I CAN'T THINK OF

[Captioner] 21:18:18
 ANY OWNER WOULD 
HAVE

[Captioner] 21:18:22
 THIS GIVE UNLIMITED 
PRIVILEGE

[Captioner] 21:18:25
 TO THE TENANTS, AS A 
WISE

[Captioner] 21:18:28
 POLITICIAN ONCE SAID, TRUST 
BUT VERIFY.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 21:18:35
>> OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS MOHAN H

[Captioner] 21:18:38

HEJDE.


[Captioner] 21:18:44
>> HONORABLE MAYOR AND CITY 
COUNCIL MEMBERS, YOU KNOW SO 
EVERY TIME,

[Captioner] 21:18:47
 LIKE EVERY TIME I'VE 
COME TO THIS MEETING I HEAR THE 
SAME

[Captioner] 21:18:50
 PEOPLE FROM MISSION PEAK 
ROAD COMPLAINING

[Captioner] 21:18:53
 ABOUT PARKING, 
YOU KNOW, ABOUT SANITARY 
CONDITIONS

[Captioner] 21:18:57
, I DON'T KNOW WHAT 
EXACTLY THEY MEAN.

[Captioner] 21:19:01

I'M BEING AT MISSION PEAK SO

[Captioner] 21:19:03
 
LONG I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING 
LIKE THAT.


[Captioner] 21:19:06
AND REMEMBER LIKE THESE ARE THE 
SAME PEOPLE WHO OPPOSE A PARKING 
LOT AND THEN

[Captioner] 21:19:09
 THEY ALWAYS 
COMPLAIN ABOUT PARKING IN THE 
NEIGHBORHOOD.


[Captioner] 21:19:12
AND THEN LET ME REMIND YOU THAT, 
YOU KNOW, YOU

[Captioner] 21:19:15
 TAKE AND HEAR THE 
IMPORTANT CITY PARK LIKE CENTRAL

[Captioner] 21:19:18
 
PARK, THERE IS NO PARKING FEE 
THERE AND THEN PEOPLE LIVING 


[Captioner] 21:19:22
ALONG THAT PLACE ARE ALSO 
AFFECTED AND THEN

[Captioner] 21:19:26
 LIKE I'M 
REALLY SURPRISED AND AMAZING 
THAT IT HAS

[Captioner] 21:19:29
 TAKEN MORE THAN TWO 
YEARS FOR THIS

[Captioner] 21:19:32
 IMPORTANT LINE 
MARKING AGREEMENT TO BE HANDLED

[Captioner] 21:19:35
.
LIKE I REMEMBER I GO

[Captioner] 21:19:38
 LIKE JUNE 
OR JULY OF 2020 THAT THE LEASE 
DISCUSSIONS

[Captioner] 21:19:42
 STARTED AND WE ARE 
IN LIKE END OF 2022 AND

[Captioner] 21:19:44
 IT'S 
STILL GOING ON.
RIGHT?


[Captioner] 21:19:47
I'M REALLY SURPRISED THAT CITY 
COUNCIL PANDERS

[Captioner] 21:19:50
 TO THESE 20 OR 
25 PEOPLE WHO COME EVERY DAY

[Captioner] 21:19:53
 
EVERY TIME OTHIS MEETING AND 
THEN COMPLAIN ABOUT THIS PLACE 


[Captioner] 21:19:56
AND REMEMBER THESE PEOPLE BUILT 
THEIR HOMES IN THE SAME PLACE

[Captioner] 21:20:00
 
KNOWING THAT THIS IS HIKING

[Captioner] 21:20:03
 
PLACE AROUND AND EACH OF THESE 
IN NEED OF THESE PLACES

[Captioner] 21:20:06
 THERE 
ARE OVER 4 MILLION COST

[Captioner] 21:20:10
, MORE 
THAN 4 MILLION, SOME OF THEM

[Captioner] 21:20:13
 ARE 
AROUND 16 ROOMS AND THEN LIKE 
THEY ARE

[Captioner] 21:20:16
 ARE CREATING ALL THESE 
HOMES AND NOW THEY WANT TO 
PREVENT

[Captioner] 21:20:20
 ANYONE ELSE DOMG THIS 
PLACE.
PLEASE REMEMBER THAT YOU KNOW SO 


[Captioner] 21:20:23
YOU ARE ALSO, YOU ALSO HAVE 
DEVELOPING

[Captioner] 21:20:26
 AND THEN WHAT IN THE 
225

[Captioner] 21:20:29
,000 FREMONT RESIDENTS THINK 
ABOUT AND THEN TAKE ACTION.
THANK

[Captioner] 21:20:32
 YOU.

[Captioner] 21:20:38

>> NEXT SPIEKER IS VERONICA.
>> MY

[Captioner] 21:20:41
 NAME IS VERONICA PANG.
GOOD EVENING

[Captioner] 21:20:44
.
CITY IS NOT JUST LEFT WITH A 
CHOICE TO

[Captioner] 21:20:48
 CHOOSE BETWEEN 
APPROVING THE LEASE NOW OR 
HAVING TO SPEND

[Captioner] 21:20:51
 A MILLION PLUS 
DOLLARS TO MANAGE THE PARK.
PLEASE

[Captioner] 21:20:54
 DO NOT RUSH.
IF

[Captioner] 21:20:58
 AGREEMENT CANNOT BE REACHED 
LET THE MONTH BE MONTH

[Captioner] 21:21:01
 TO MONTH 

[Captioner] 21:21:05
  
TEMPORARILY.


[Captioner] 21:21:10
LEASE AS AUTHORIZED ON NOVEMBER 
15th IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE

[Captioner] 21:21:13
 THAT 
THE DISTRICT IS UNABLE TO 
COOPERATE WITH CITY.


[Captioner] 21:21:16
THE DISTRICT HAS NOT BEEN 
COOPERATING IN THE PAST.

[Captioner] 21:21:19

HOW WILL THEY COOPERATE AND ACT 
IN GOOD FAITH IN THE

[Captioner] 21:21:22
 FUTURE WHEN 
THEY HAVE ABSOLUTE CONTROL OF 
THE PARK AND WITHOUT

[Captioner] 21:21:26
 ANY 
PERFORMANCE METRICS FOR 20 YEARS

[Captioner] 21:21:28

YEARS?
NO PARKING LOT OF ANY SIZE 


[Captioner] 21:21:31
SHOULD BE PUT ON THE PRESERVE.
THE SIDE

[Captioner] 21:21:34
 LETTER STATING A 
PARKING STRUCTURE WOULD NOT BE 
BUILT IS

[Captioner] 21:21:38
 NOT ENFORCEABLE 
ACCORDING TO CITY ATTORNEY ON 
NOVEMBER 15th.

[Captioner] 21:21:42

THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE.
WE NEED SOMETHING ENFORCEABLE

[Captioner] 21:21:45
 IN 
THE CONTRACT.
ALSO, PARK HOURS SHOULD BE 


[Captioner] 21:21:48
STATED ON THE LEASE.
THE STANFORD ENTRANCE

[Captioner] 21:21:52
 IS 
SITUATED WITHIN A RESIDENTIAL 
AREA BELONGING TO FREMONT, AND

[Captioner] 21:21:55
 
SO CITY SHOULD HAVE THE 
AUTHORITY TO SET THE

[Captioner] 21:21:58
 HOURS 
AFFECTING ITS RESIDENTS.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 21:22:08
>> OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS KEITH 
PARKER.


[Captioner] 21:22:16
>> SO MISSION PEAK OR THE SOME 
IT'S A REGULAR PART OF OUR

[Captioner] 21:22:19
 
LIVES, WHERE WE EXERCISE AROUND

[Captioner] 21:22:22
 
TO OTHERS, IT IS A BIG HILL IN 
THE DISTANCE

[Captioner] 21:22:26
.
MISSION PEAK IS AN ICONIC THING 
IN FREMONT.


[Captioner] 21:22:30
IT IS A BIG THING IN THE MIDDLE 
OF OUR CITY LOGO

[Captioner] 21:22:33
.
EAST BAY REGIONAL PARK DISTRICT 
HAS DONE AN

[Captioner] 21:22:37
 EXCELLENT JOB OF 
MANAGING

[Captioner] 21:22:40
 THE MISSION PEAK FOR 
OVER FOUR

[Captioner] 21:22:43
 DECADES.
HIKING AND RECREATION AREAS OF 
THE

[Captioner] 21:22:47
 ENTIRE EAST BAY.
MISSION PEAK TRULY IS ONE OF THE 
CROWN

[Captioner] 21:22:50
 JEWELS OF FREMONT.
DURING THEIR MANY DECADES

[Captioner] 21:22:53
 OF 
MANAGING THIS AREA THE PARK 
DISTRICT HAS BEEN

[Captioner] 21:22:56
 AN OUTSTANDING 
PARTNER FOR THE CITY OF FREMONT.
AS IT HAS

[Captioner] 21:22:59
 BEEN FOR ALL THE 
CITIES ACROSS THE EAST BAY.

[Captioner] 21:23:02

THE EAST BAY REGIONAL PARK 
DISTRICT CURRENTLY MAINTAINS

[Captioner] 21:23:06
 THE 
LARGEST REGIONAL PARK DISTRICT 
IN THE

[Captioner] 21:23:08
 ENTIRE COUNTRY, 65 PARKS 
AND OVER 1200 MIEMTION

[Captioner] 21:23:11
 OF HIKING 
TRAILS.
ONE MIGHT THINK THEY WOULD BE 


[Captioner] 21:23:15
DOING SOMETHING RIGHT.
SO OVER FOUR DECADES OF

[Captioner] 21:23:18
 
OUTSTANDING MANAGEMENT, OVER 
FOUR DECADES OF

[Captioner] 21:23:21
 EXEMPLARY 
STEWARDSHIP, OVER FOUR DECADES 
OF

[Captioner] 21:23:25
 PARTNERSHIP, THAT'S WHAT WE 
HAVE HERE.
NOW WE HAVE A

[Captioner] 21:23:28
 DANGER OF THROWING 
IT ALL AWAY, ON THE SPHERE THAT

[Captioner] 21:23:31
 
THEY WOULD BE GOING ROGUE AND

[Captioner] 21:23:36
 
BUILDING A PARKING LOT OR THEY 
MIGHT DO THE UN

[Captioner] 21:23:39
THINKABLE OF 
CHANGING THE OPERATING HOURS

[Captioner] 21:23:42
 OF 
THE PARK, WHICH AGAIN THEY SAY 
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO DO

[Captioner] 21:23:45
.
NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE DISTRICT 
HAVE GOTTEN TO THE POINT WHERE 


[Captioner] 21:23:49
THEY ARE SO FRUSTRATED BY THE 
CITY THAT

[Captioner] 21:23:52
 THE CITY TAKING OVER 
MANAGEMENT OF THE PARK

[Captioner] 21:23:54
 IS 
APPARENTLY ONE OF THE OPTIONS ON 
THE TABLE.


[Captioner] 21:23:57
THEY DON'T WANT TO DO THAT.
THEY WANT

[Captioner] 21:24:00
 TO RESPONSIBLY MANAGE 
THE

[Captioner] 21:24:04
 PARK JUST LIKE THEY HAVE 
DONE AND

[Captioner] 21:24:08
 WE DON'T WANT TO DO 
THAT.
IT'S TIME TO BE REASONABLE

[Captioner] 21:24:10
 AND 
MOVE FORWARD AS RECOMMENDED BY 
STAFF.


[Captioner] 21:24:13
LET'S GET THIS DONE.


[Captioner] 21:24:16
>> NEXT SPIEKER IS RAVI KASWAN

[Captioner] 21:24:19
I.
>> GOOD EVENING, MAYOR

[Captioner] 21:24:23
 AND CITY 
COUNCIL MEMBERS.
I

[Captioner] 21:24:26
 URGE YOU TO REJECT THE 
PROPOSED LEASE FOR MISSION

[Captioner] 21:24:29
 PEAK 
STANFORD AS PRESENTED.
I HAVE

[Captioner] 21:24:33
 REVIEWED THESE LEASE 
DOCUMENTS AND I'M RAISING FOUR 
VERY

[Captioner] 21:24:36
 SERIOUS CONCERNS HERE, 
THESE ARE CONCERNS

[Captioner] 21:24:40
 THAT ARE 
GOING TO BECOME A HEADACHE FOR 
PEOPLE WHO VISIT THE PARK AS 


[Captioner] 21:24:43
WELL AS THE PEOPLE AND THE 
RESIDENTS.
NUMBER 1,

[Captioner] 21:24:46
 THE SINGLE LIMIT OF 
INSURANCE IS

[Captioner] 21:24:49
 WAY TOO LOW.
WHAT INSURANCE ARE THEY GOING TO

[Captioner] 21:24:52
 
PROVIDE PROPERTY OWNERS OR 
DAMAGE COST TO THE PROPERTIES BY 


[Captioner] 21:24:56
THE PARK LAND, SAY FOR LACK OF 
MAINTENANCE

[Captioner] 21:24:59
, ADVERSE 
IMPROVEMENTS?
LACK OF APPROPRIATE

[Captioner] 21:25:03
 FIRE 
MITIGATION OR PREP CONTROL?
I'M A REGULAR

[Captioner] 21:25:06
 VISITOR OF THE 
PARK, I SEE PLENTY OF LARGE

[Captioner] 21:25:10
 DOGS 
WITHOUT LEASH AND WITHOUT VOICE 
CONTROL

[Captioner] 21:25:13
 OF OWNERS.
ANY OF THESE INCIDENCES WILL 
CONSUME THIS

[Captioner] 21:25:16
 LIMIT.
$3 MILLION SHOULD BE PER CLAIM

[Captioner] 21:25:20
.
CONCERN NUMBER 2, THE STAFF 
REPORT SAYS THE

[Captioner] 21:25:23
 CITY MAY SELECT 
TO HOST A COMMUNITY MEETING 
BEFORE

[Captioner] 21:25:26
 DETERMINING WHETHER TO 
PROCEED WITH THE CAPITAL PROJECT 
THAT REQUIRES

[Captioner] 21:25:29
 PERMIT.
WHAT I'VE SEEN IN THE LEASE 
DOCUMENT IS CITY MAY

[Captioner] 21:25:32
 CHOOSE TO 
HOLD A COMMUNITY MEETING AT A 
DESIGNATED

[Captioner] 21:25:35
 LOCATION BUT FOR WHAT 
PURPOSE IT'S NOT CLEAR.
THE STAFF

[Captioner] 21:25:39
 REPORT CONCERN NUMBER 
3 SAYS, YOU KNOW, THEY'VE

[Captioner] 21:25:42
 AGREED 
TO A SIDE LETTER TO NOT BUILD A 
PARKING LOT.


[Captioner] 21:25:45
WHAT DOES THE SIDE LETTER MEAN?
WHAT IS THE LEGAL BINDING

[Captioner] 21:25:48
 OF THE 
SIDE LETTER?
WHY NOT INCORPORATE NOT BUILDING

[Captioner] 21:25:51
 
THE PARKING LOT IN THE LEASE 
ITSELF.


[Captioner] 21:25:54
AND THEN FINALLY CONCERN NUMBER 
4 ITEM NUMBER 18

[Captioner] 21:25:57
 IN THE LEASE 
SAYS THIS LEASE MAY BE

[Captioner] 21:26:00
 IMAWNED, 
MODIFIED AT ANY TIME

[Captioner] 21:26:04
 THAT THE 
CITY OF FREMONT AND THE 
DIRECTORS OF THE

[Captioner] 21:26:08
 EAST BAY 
REGIONAL PARK DISTRICT.
HOW WOULD THESE

[Captioner] 21:26:11
 ISSUES WORK?
WOULD THERE BE A PUBLIC HEARING?
WITHOUT

[Captioner] 21:26:14
 ANY MODIFICATION THIS 
LEASE HAS NO LEGAL BINDING, THIS 
SECTION

[Captioner] 21:26:19
 SHOULD BE COMPLETELY 
REMOVED.
BECAUSE OF THE CONCERNS

[Captioner] 21:26:22
 I WOULD 
SAY WE SHOULD NOT SIGN 20

[Captioner] 21:26:25
 YEARS.
THANK YOU.
>> OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS SAR

[Captioner] 21:26:28
ESH.


[Captioner] 21:26:33
>> HI, CAN YOU HEAR ME?
>> YES.


[Captioner] 21:26:36
>> HONORABLE MAYOR AND CITY 
COUNCIL MEMBERS.
TO

[Captioner] 21:26:39
 BEGIN WITH, I SUPPORT THE

[Captioner] 21:26:42
 
SPEAKER WHO SAID THE CITY SHOULD 
GO AHEAD AND SIGN

[Captioner] 21:26:47
 THE BEST 
AGREEMENT THAT THEY HAVE -- THE 
STAFF HAS NEGOTIATE

[Captioner] 21:26:50
ED.

[Captioner] 21:26:53

THE STAFF HAS ALREADY NEGOTIATED 
A NUMBER OF CONCESSIONS

[Captioner] 21:26:56
 OVER THE 
PREVIOUS LEASE.
I WANT TO

[Captioner] 21:27:00
 TALK ABOUT A MYTH THAT 
HAS BEEN OFTEN QUOTED,

[Captioner] 21:27:03
 OR 
REPEATED IN MANY OF THESE

[Captioner] 21:27:06
 
MEETINGS ABOUT, WELL, YOU KNOW,

[Captioner] 21:27:11
 
OHLONE ENTRANCE AND THE STANFORD 
ENTRANCE

[Captioner] 21:27:14
, THEY BOTH LEAD TO THE 
SAME PEAK.
SO

[Captioner] 21:27:18
 WHY DO PEOPLE COME TO THE 
STANFORD ENTRANCE?
AND

[Captioner] 21:27:21
 THE CLAIM IS WELL THEY CAME 
HERE BECAUSE THEY WANT TO SAVE 
THE

[Captioner] 21:27:25
 $4 IN PARKING AND NOTHING 
CAN BE FURTHER FROM TRUTH

[Captioner] 21:27:28
.
IN FACT VERY FEW HIKERS MAKE IT 
TO THE PEAK.

[Captioner] 21:27:31

MOST CONSIDER IT A 
ACCOMPLISHMENT IF THEY MAKE IT 


[Captioner] 21:27:34
TO THE THIRD OR FOURTH BENCH ON 
THE STANFORD ENTRANCE.

[Captioner] 21:27:37

THIS INCLUDES PEOPLE WHOSE 
HOUSES ARE CLOSE TO THE ENTRANCE

[Captioner] 21:27:40

ENTRANCE.
IN THE '90s I USED TO RACE

[Captioner] 21:27:43
 TO 
THE PEAK ABOUT AN HOUR.

[Captioner] 21:27:46

UNFORTUNATELY AGE HAS THAN I ITS 
TOLL.


[Captioner] 21:27:49
I HAVEN'T BEEN TO THE PEAK SINCE 
2007,

[Captioner] 21:27:52
 TODAY I CANNOT EVEN GO TO 
THE POINT WHERE THE TWO

[Captioner] 21:27:55
 TRAILS 
MEET AND THERE ARE MANY REASONS 
WHY MYSELF AND MANY

[Captioner] 21:27:59
 OTHER PEOPLE 
USE THE STANFORD TRAIL.
IT

[Captioner] 21:28:02
 IS FREE OF POISON OAK, IT IS 
22

[Captioner] 21:28:05
 FEET WIDE WITH AN EXCELLENT 
ROAD BASE AND GRAVEL SO THAT

[Captioner] 21:28:08
 ONE 
DOES NOT NEED TO MOVE TO THE 
SIDE TO

[Captioner] 21:28:12
 AVOID RISKING POISON OAK 
RASH TO LET OTHERS PASS

[Captioner] 21:28:15
.
IT DOES NOT HAVE SNARE OWE 
SECTIONS WHICH HAVE

[Captioner] 21:28:18
 SHARP DROP 
ON ONE SIDE.
IT HAS BENCHES FOR PEOPLE TO

[Captioner] 21:28:21
 
REST AND ENJOY THE VIEW.
IT OFFERS UNPARALLEL

[Captioner] 21:28:24
ED VIEWS 
THAT CANNOT BE MATCHED ANYWHERE 
ELSE.


[Captioner] 21:28:27
IT IS A GREAT TRAIL TO MAKE NEW 
FRIENDS.
IN FACT THE FRIEND THAT

[Captioner] 21:28:31
 I'VE 
BEEN HIKING FOR THE LAST TEN 
YEARS ARE PEOPLE THAT I

[Captioner] 21:28:34
 MET ON.
>> OUR NEXT SPEAKER

[Captioner] 21:28:39
 IS MARYELLE

[Captioner] 21:28:43
 
OYONO.

[Captioner] 21:28:48

MARY, PLEASE UNMUTE.


[Captioner] 21:28:51
>> I UNDERSTAND THAT ALL PEOPLE 
HAVE THE RIGHT TO ENJOY MISSION

[Captioner] 21:28:54
 
PEAK.
HOWEVER, WHEN IT'S SURROUND

[Captioner] 21:28:58
ING 
RESIDENTS, PEACEFUL LIVING AND 
SECURITY

[Captioner] 21:29:02
 ARE INVADED BY EARLY 
MORNING TRAFFIC, CROWDS,

[Captioner] 21:29:05
 NOISE, 
TRASH, AND IN A FEW INSTANCES,

[Captioner] 21:29:09
 
CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES, SOME 
REGULATIONS AND LIMITS

[Captioner] 21:29:12
 SHOULD BE 
PLACED.
TO PROTECT THE RESIDENTS

[Captioner] 21:29:16
' RIGHT 
TO A CLEAN AND PEACEFUL 
NEIGHBORHOOD

[Captioner] 21:29:19
.
I HAVE HEARD ARGUMENTS THAT 
MISSION PEAK PARK EXIST

[Captioner] 21:29:22
ED BEFORE 
THE STANFORD NEIGHBORHOOD.
THEREFORE, THE

[Captioner] 21:29:25
 VISITORS' RIGHTS 
TO ENJOY THE PARK

[Captioner] 21:29:30
 TAKES 
PRECEDENCE OVER THE STANFORD 
NEIGHBORHOOD

[Captioner] 21:29:33
'S RESIDENTS RIGHT 
TO ENJOY A CLEAN AND PEACEFUL

[Captioner] 21:29:36
 
SURROUNDING.
I THINK THIS ARGUMENT IS A BIG 


[Captioner] 21:29:40
INSULT TO OUR NEIGHBORHOOD 
BECAUSE IT SAYS THAT OUR RIGHTS 
TO

[Captioner] 21:29:43
 SECURITY AND ENJOYMENT OF 
PEACEFUL AND

[Captioner] 21:29:46
 QUIETNESS IN OUR 
OWN HOMES DO NOT MATTER.

[Captioner] 21:29:50

I UNDERSTAND THAT THE CITY OF 
FREMONT WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A

[Captioner] 21:29:54
 
LEASE AGREEMENT WITH THE -- WITH

[Captioner] 21:29:57
 
EAST BAY REGIONAL PARK BECAUSE 
OF THE FISCAL IMPACT

[Captioner] 21:30:00
.
HOWEVER, I WOULD LIKE TO SAY DO

[Captioner] 21:30:03
 
NOT SELL OUT THE RESIDENTS AT 
MISSION

[Captioner] 21:30:06
 PEAK NEIGHBORHOOD.
WHATEVER WE SIGN NEEDS TO BE

[Captioner] 21:30:10
 
VERY SPECIFIC.
BECAUSE IT

[Captioner] 21:30:13
 HAS VERY LARGE IMPACT 
ON THE NEIGHBORHOOD

[Captioner] 21:30:16
.
THESE ARE MY SUGGESTIONS.
I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE

[Captioner] 21:30:20
 IT STATED 
IN THE LEASE THAT NO PARKING 
STRUCTURE CAN BE

[Captioner] 21:30:23
 BUILT.
NUMBER 2, PARKING HOURS

[Captioner] 21:30:26
 SHOULD 
BE NO LATER THAN 9 P.M.
AND SHOULD NOT

[Captioner] 21:30:30
 BE SUBJECT TO 
CHANGE.
NUMBER 3, MAKE PERMANENT

[Captioner] 21:30:33
 PARKING 
PROGRAM PERMANENT.
BECAUSE IT HAS WORKED

[Captioner] 21:30:37
.
MAKE OHLONE COLLEGE THE PRIMARY

[Captioner] 21:30:40
 
DESIRED ENTRANCE TO MISSION PEAK 
AND

[Captioner] 21:30:43
 THERE SHOULD BE ANNUAL 
REVIEW OF ITS PROGRESS.
AND

[Captioner] 21:30:47
 LEASE TEARM OF 20 YEARS IS 
JUST TOO LONG.

[Captioner] 21:30:50

ALL CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT NEEDS TO 
BE

[Captioner] 21:30:54
 APPROVED BY THE CITY COUNCIL.
THANK YOU.
>> OUR NEXT SPEAKER

[Captioner] 21:30:57
 IS WILLIAM 
EUREK

[Captioner] 21:31:00
KE.
>> GOOD EVENING,

[Captioner] 21:31:04
 THIS IS WILLIAM 
EUREGE

[Captioner] 21:31:07
, EAST BAY

[Captioner] 21:31:12
 CONSERVANCY.
WE WORKED WITH THE CITY 
TRANSPORTATION

[Captioner] 21:31:15
 AND PARK DISTRICT 
TO GET SIGNAGE ON THE STREETS

[Captioner] 21:31:18
 
COVERED SO THAT PEOPLE COULD 
ACTUALLY PARK OUT THERE BEFORE 


[Captioner] 21:31:22
8:00 IN THE MORNING.
WE DID THE SAME THING

[Captioner] 21:31:25
 WITH 
PICKERRING STREET AND

[Captioner] 21:31:28
 PLATEAU 
WHERE WE WORKED WITH THE CITY 
TRANSPORTATION DEPARTMENT TO 


[Captioner] 21:31:31
MAKE SURE THAT PARKING WAS 
AVAILABLE.
PARKING DOESN'T HAVE TO BE

[Captioner] 21:31:34
 
CONFRONTATIONAL.
YOU KNOW THE BOTTOM LINE IS

[Captioner] 21:31:37
, 
COYOTE HILLS GETS 840,000

[Captioner] 21:31:40
 PEOPLE 
A YEAR.
YOU NEVER TALK ABOUT IT IN A

[Captioner] 21:31:44
 
PERSPECTIVE AS HAVING CONFLICT.
THERE IS NO CONFLICT THERE.


[Captioner] 21:31:47
IT'S NOT BECAUSE THERE IS NOBODY 
THAT LIVES AROUND THERE.
IT'S BECAUSE

[Captioner] 21:31:50
 THERE IS NOT A 
SMALL GROUP OF RESIDENTS THAT 
HAVE CONTROLLED THE

[Captioner] 21:31:53
 MINDSET OF 
THE COUNCIL.
THIS THING COMES UP

[Captioner] 21:31:56
 AGAIN AND 
AGAIN AND IT HAS TO STOP.
THE LEASE NEEDS

[Captioner] 21:32:00
 TO BE REU 
RENEWED UNLESS YOU ARE WILLING 
TO SPEND A MILLION

[Captioner] 21:32:04
 DOLLARS OR 
MORE TO MANAGE THE PARK AND IF 
YOU ARE WILLING

[Captioner] 21:32:07
 TO SPEND A 
MILLION DOLLARS OR MORE, LET'S 
TAKE

[Captioner] 21:32:10
 THE LOCAL DISTRICT, THE 
LOCAL AREA,

[Captioner] 21:32:13
 RAJ SALWAN'S AREA, 
LET THEM PAY FOR THE

[Captioner] 21:32:16
 MANAGEMENT 
OF THAT PARK.
IT IS A REGIONAL PARK AVAILABLE 


[Captioner] 21:32:19
TO EVERYBODY.
UNLESS WE ARE ONLY GOING TO MAKE 
IT A PRIVATE PARK FOR THE

[Captioner] 21:32:22
 
NEIGHBORHOOD.
I MEAN, YOU KNOW, IT IS 


[Captioner] 21:32:25
INTERESTING.
THEY WANT TO DENY SANITARY 
TOILETS,

[Captioner] 21:32:29
 BECAUSE THEY WANT LESS 
PEOPLE TO ENTER THE PARK.
THAT'S IN

[Captioner] 21:32:32
SANE.
THIS IS A REGIONAL PARK.
WE NEED TO

[Captioner] 21:32:35
 ALLOW ACCESS TO THE 
PUBLIC AND WE NEED TO MANAGE IT

[Captioner] 21:32:38
 
LIKE IT'S A PROFESSIONAL 
ENTRANCE WHICH I MEAN IT IS

[Captioner] 21:32:42
, YOU 
KNOW, IT IS AN ENTRANCE USED BY 
LOTS OF PEOPLE

[Captioner] 21:32:45
.
APPROXIMATELY 479 IF YOU AVERAGE 
THE 175

[Captioner] 21:32:48
,000 A YEAR, IT'S NOT A 
BIG NUMBER

[Captioner] 21:32:51
.
YOU KNOW, AT LEAST WE THINK THE 
LEASE SHOULD BE

[Captioner] 21:32:55
 RESIGNED.
THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 21:32:59

>> OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS GARY 
PARK.


[Captioner] 21:33:04
>> THANK YOU.
MAYOR

[Captioner] 21:33:07
 MEI AND CITY COUNCIL 
MEMBERS, FIRST AND FOREMOST, 
I'VE

[Captioner] 21:33:10
 HEARD A LOT OF STUFF ABOUT 
PARK OPENING AND CLOSING

[Captioner] 21:33:14
 CLOSING 
ENTRANCE AND ALL THAT.

[Captioner] 21:33:17

NOBODY IS TRYING TO CLOSE THIS 
ENTRANCE OR CANCEL THE LEASE

[Captioner] 21:33:20
 AS 
SOME ARE FOR STRAYING IT.
THIS

[Captioner] 21:33:23
 LEASE DOES REQUIRE LANGUAGE 
FOR PROPER OPERATIONS,

[Captioner] 21:33:26
 
RESPONSIBILITIES AND DISCIPLINE 
BY USERS.


[Captioner] 21:33:29
THE STAFF RECOMMENDED APPROVAL 
BECAUSE OF IT

[Captioner] 21:33:32
 APPARENTLY IS THAT 
EAST BAY REGIONAL PARK IS 
THREATENING

[Captioner] 21:33:35
 THE CITY.
THEY DO NOT WANT TO NEGOTIATE 
ANYTHING

[Captioner] 21:33:38
.
SIGN IT OR LEAVE IT,

[Captioner] 21:33:41
 JUST THE 
BEGINNING, THIS IS ALARMING.
WHAT WILL YOU EXPECT

[Captioner] 21:33:44
 IN TERMS OF 
COOPERATION FROM THEM IN THE 
FUTURE?


[Captioner] 21:33:47
ALL THE LEASE LANGUAGE IS BASED 
ON REASONABLENESS AND

[Captioner] 21:33:50
 WORKING 
TOGETHER AND COOPERATION.
THERE IS NO GOOD

[Captioner] 21:33:53
 FAITH HERE THAT 
THE CITY CAN RELY UPON

[Captioner] 21:33:56
.
ALL OF THAT CAN BE THROWN OUT 
THE WINDOW BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT

[Captioner] 21:34:00
 
EVEN READY TO COMPROMISE OR

[Captioner] 21:34:03
 
NEGOTIATE SOMETHING THAT IS 
REALLY A SITUATION

[Captioner] 21:34:06
.
THERE IS A SIDE LETTER, 
EVERYBODY'S TALKED ABOUT

[Captioner] 21:34:10
 IT IN 
THE AGREEMENT, THE CITY ATTORNEY 
HAS

[Captioner] 21:34:13
 SAID NOPE IT IS NOT AN 
AGREEMENT IT CANNOT BE ENFORCED

[Captioner] 21:34:15
.
THAT IS ONLY BASED ON GOOD 
FAITH.


[Captioner] 21:34:18
IS A 20 YEAR LEASE BASED ON GOOD 
FAITH

[Captioner] 21:34:23
?
LAST HEARD, SIGN IT AND WE'LL 
FIGURE IT

[Captioner] 21:34:26
 OUT LATER.
NO REALISTIC LEASE IS SIGNED

[Captioner] 21:34:29
 ON 
IMPROPER NEGOTIATIONS

[Captioner] 21:34:31
 TO BE 
FIGURED OUTER LATER.
THAT IS INSANE.


[Captioner] 21:34:34
HOW CAN THE CITY BE FORCED TO DO 
THAT?

[Captioner] 21:34:37

PLEASE REMEMBER IF YOU DO THIS 
WITHOUT HAVING PROPER LANGUAGE 


[Captioner] 21:34:41
THE CITY COUNCIL WILL BE 
REMEMBERED FOREVER.
THIS IS NOT WHAT YOU REALLY WANT

[Captioner] 21:34:44

WANT.
THE PEOPLE TALKED ABOUT A $3 


[Captioner] 21:34:47
MILLION INSURANCE.
WE JUST HEARD $1 MILLION EIGHT

[Captioner] 21:34:50
 
YEARS AGO, WHAT IS WORTH TODAY.


[Captioner] 21:34:53
$3 MILLION FLAT NOT EVEN PER 
EVENT OR

[Captioner] 21:34:56
 PER OCCURRENCE.
WHAT IS IT WORTH IN TEN YEARS

[Captioner] 21:35:00
 OR 
20 YEARS DOWN THE ROAD, THINK  
ABOUT

[Captioner] 21:35:03
 IT.
THANK YOU.
>> OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS

[Captioner] 21:35:06
 BEN.

[Captioner] 21:35:09

>> GOOD EVENING, MAYOR AND CITY 
COUNCIL.


[Captioner] 21:35:12
THIS IS BEN YEE.
I'VE BEEN A MISSION PEEK

[Captioner] 21:35:15
 PARK 
USER SINCE 1991 AND A FORMER V

[Captioner] 21:35:18

VTSP BIKE PATROLLER FOR OVER

[Captioner] 21:35:21
 
SEVEN YEARS PAROLE FOR

[Captioner] 21:35:25
 EAST BAY 
REGIONAL PARKS.
I SAY I

[Captioner] 21:35:28
 AM IN SUPPORT OF THE 
LEASE AGREEMENT.
THEY SPEND

[Captioner] 21:35:31
 APPROXIMATELY 
$450,000 A YEAR TO MAINTAIN THIS 
ENTRANCE.

[Captioner] 21:35:34

SO IS THE CITY WILLING TO TAKE 
THIS ENTRANCE OVER AND PAY

[Captioner] 21:35:37
 OR 
THE THAT MAINTENANCE?
IF WE CLOSE THE

[Captioner] 21:35:40
 ENTRANCE DOWN 
WILL

[Captioner] 21:35:43
 THE ELECTEDS WILLING TO 
HANDLE

[Captioner] 21:35:47
 THE BACKLASH?
I'D LIKE TO REMIND

[Captioner] 21:35:50
 THE 
HOMEOWNERS NEAR MISSION PEAK 
THAT CURRENTLY THE NUMBER OF

[Captioner] 21:35:53
 
PARK USERS HAS DECREASED

[Captioner] 21:35:56
 
SIGNIFICANTLY SINCE 2012,

[Captioner] 21:35:59
 2013.
FOR THE PARK USERS YOU'RE GOING 
INTO SOMEONE

[Captioner] 21:36:03
'S NEIGHBORHOOD SO 
PLEASE SHOW THEM RESPECT.
I HAVE SEEN

[Captioner] 21:36:06
 PEOPLE BLASTING 
THEIR RADIOS AND SPEAKING LOUDLY 
IN LARGE

[Captioner] 21:36:09
 GROUPS AS EARLY AS 4 
A.M.
BUT THE WORST

[Captioner] 21:36:12
 WAS WHEN I CAUGHT 
PEOPLE URINATING AND DEFECATING 
IN

[Captioner] 21:36:15
 THIS NEIGHBORHOOD AND FOR 
THOSE WHO SAY THE PARK WAS HERE 
FIRST,

[Captioner] 21:36:18
 THAT IS TRUE.
BUT WHEN THE HOMES WERE BUILT IN 
1996

[Captioner] 21:36:22
 AND I WAS ON PATROL I WAS 
MORE WORRIED ABOUT

[Captioner] 21:36:25
 THE ANIMALS 
IN THE PARK.
THERE WERE VERY FEW HIKE

[Captioner] 21:36:28
ERS ON 
THE TRAIL AT THE TIME AND NO ONE 
AT THE TIME WOULD HAVE PREDICTED

[Captioner] 21:36:32
 
THE USE TEN TO 15 YEARS LATER.
IF PEOPLE WANT TO FURTHER

[Captioner] 21:36:35
 
ADDRESS ISSUES AT MISSION PEAK 
AN IDEA OF

[Captioner] 21:36:38
 AN AUTOMATIC GATE HAS 
BEEN FLOATING AROUND FOR YEARS 
AND

[Captioner] 21:36:42
 WOULD ADDRESS THE REMAINDER 
OF THE ISSUES

[Captioner] 21:36:45
.
THE TITLE IT HAS IS LOVE TO

[Captioner] 21:36:48
 
DEATH, WHICH IS WHAT THE 
NEIGHBORS HAVE TO

[Captioner] 21:36:51
 DEAL WITH.
AND AGAIN LEASE ACCEPT THE LEASE 
AGREEMENT

[Captioner] 21:36:55
 FROM THE PARK 
DISTRICT.
IT IS FOR THE BEST INTERESTS OF 


[Captioner] 21:36:58
THE CITY OF FREMONT AND ITS PARK 
USERS, THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 21:37:02
>> OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS

[Captioner] 21:37:05
 SUE JATA.
>> GOOD EVENING.

[Captioner] 21:37:08

MY NAME IS SUE JATA.
I'M

[Captioner] 21:37:12
 A FREMONT RESIDENT AND LIKE 
TO STATE THAT WE DO NOT NEED

[Captioner] 21:37:15
 A 
PARKING LOT OF ANY

[Captioner] 21:37:19
 SIZE AT THE 
STANFORD STAGING AREA OF MISSION 
PEAK

[Captioner] 21:37:22
.
WE HAVE A TAXPAYER FUNDED 
PARKING LOT AT

[Captioner] 21:37:25
 OHLONE COLLEGE 
THAT CAN BE USED BY HIKERS.
WE

[Captioner] 21:37:29
 SHOULD ENCOURAGE THIS.
THE PARKING LOT IS A

[Captioner] 21:37:32
 VERY 
CRITICAL TOPIC AND SHOULD NOT BE 
ADDRESS

[Captioner] 21:37:36
ED VIA A SIDE LETTER 
WHICH IS NON

[Captioner] 21:37:39
BINDING.
IT SHOULD BE VERY CLEARLY STATE

[Captioner] 21:37:42
ED 
AND ENFORCED IN THE LEASE.

[Captioner] 21:37:45

ALSO, WE NEED PROPER VISIT

[Captioner] 21:37:49
OR 
ENFORCEMENT AT MISSION PEAK.
THERE HAVE BEEN

[Captioner] 21:37:52
 TWO FIRES THAT 
WERE STARTED DURING TIMES

[Captioner] 21:37:55
 THAT 
THE PARK WAS SUPPOSEDLY CLOSED

[Captioner] 21:37:58
.
WHY WERE THE PEOPLE IN THE PARK 
AT THAT TIME

[Captioner] 21:38:03
?
IN THE EVENT OF DAMAGE TO LIFE 
OR

[Captioner] 21:38:07
 PROPERTY CAUSED BY EVENTS 
LIKE THIS, WHAT KIND OF 
INSURANCE

[Captioner] 21:38:09
 DOES THE PARK DISTRICT 
HAVE?
WE ALL KNOW

[Captioner] 21:38:13
 THAT IS CLEARLY 
INADEQUATE.
PLEASE

[Captioner] 21:38:16
 DO NOT BE IN A

[Captioner] 21:38:19
 RUSH TO 
SIGN THE LEASE.
LET'S TAKE THE TIME AND GO ON A 


[Captioner] 21:38:22
MONTH TO MONTH LEASE UNLESS ALL 
OF THESE

[Captioner] 21:38:25
 ISSUES CAN BE 
ADEQUATELY ADDRESSED IN THE

[Captioner] 21:38:29
 
TERMS AND CONDITIONS CAN BE 
CLEARLY STATED AS

[Captioner] 21:38:32
 IS ALWAYS THE 
PURPOSE OF A CONTRACT.

[Captioner] 21:38:35

WE HAVE THE TIME.
LET'S TAKE THE TIME.


[Captioner] 21:38:38
DO OUR DUE DILIGENCE AND GET 
THIS RIGHT.

[Captioner] 21:38:41

THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 21:38:44
>> OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS

[Captioner] 21:38:47
 KELLY 
ABREW

[Captioner] 21:38:51
 
ABREU.
>> THERE IS A NO

[Captioner] 21:38:53
 GOOD FAITH IN 
THIS CITY.
THE CITY COUNCIL AND MAYOR 


[Captioner] 21:38:56
SUPPORTED THE PARKING EXPANSION 
IN 2012

[Captioner] 21:39:00
 AND 2015.
THE LOCAL RESIDENTS DID NOT ASK

[Captioner] 21:39:03
 
FOR MORE REST ROOMS WHEN THEY 
FIRST

[Captioner] 21:39:06
 HEARD ABOUT YOU'RE NATION 
AND DEFECATION.
THE CITY

[Captioner] 21:39:09
 DOESN'T OWN A VALUABLE 
ASSET AT MISSION

[Captioner] 21:39:12
 PEAK.
IT OWNS AN EXPENSIVE LIABILITY 
WITH

[Captioner] 21:39:15
 REAL OPERATING RISKS AND 
REAL

[Captioner] 21:39:19
 OPERATING COSTS.
MANY ANTI

[Captioner] 21:39:22
PARK

[Captioner] 21:39:27
 ACTIVISTS,

[Captioner] 21:39:30
 THE 
CITY HAS REFUSED TO RENEW

[Captioner] 21:39:33
 THE 
LEASE IN NOVEMBER 2021 AND THEN

[Captioner] 21:39:36
 
AGAIN THREE WEEKS AGO.
BUT MISSION PEAK WON'T GO AWAY 


[Captioner] 21:39:40
AND YOUR COUNCIL CAN'T THROW 
THIS PARK IN THE RECYCLE BIN 
WHEN

[Captioner] 21:39:43
 YOU GET TIRED OF KICKING IT 
AROUND.
I'M WORRIED

[Captioner] 21:39:46
 THAT THE CITY 
COUNCIL IS ACTING LIKE THE DOG 
THAT CAUGHT THE

[Captioner] 21:39:49
 CAR.
HAVING SPENT THE LAST THREE

[Captioner] 21:39:53
 
YEARS DEMANDING FULL CONTROL 
OVER THE PARK,

[Captioner] 21:39:56
 THIS COUNCIL IS 
ONLY

[Captioner] 21:39:59
 NOW DISCOVERING THAT THE 
CITY LACKS THE BUDGET RESOURCES 
AND

[Captioner] 21:40:02
 LACKS THE POLITICAL WILL TO 
OPERATE IT.


[Captioner] 21:40:05
IT'S TIME FOR THIS COUNCIL TO 
REALIZE THAT

[Captioner] 21:40:09
 YOU REPRESENT THE 
ENTIRE CITY.

[Captioner] 21:40:12

NOT JUST A FEW ANTIPARK

[Captioner] 21:40:15
 
ACTIVISTS WHO CALL THEMSELVES 
THE COMMUNITY.

[Captioner] 21:40:18

THE CITY COUNCIL HAS TO GROW UP.
AND STOP CHASING

[Captioner] 21:40:22
 THIS CAR.
YOUR COUNCIL SHOULD PUT ASIDE

[Captioner] 21:40:26
 
THE MISTAKES IT HAS MADE IN THE 
PAST, BY SIGNING THE 20

[Captioner] 21:40:29
-YEAR 
LEASE EXTENSION.
THE CITY NEEDS THE

[Captioner] 21:40:32
 PARK DISTRICT 
TO OPERATE MISSION PEAK IN 
COMPLIANCE

[Captioner] 21:40:36
 WITH PROFESSIONAL 
STANDARDS AS A REGIONAL

[Captioner] 21:40:39
 ASSET 
FOR RECREATION

[Captioner] 21:40:42
, PUBLIC HEALTH 
AND NATURAL PRESERVATION.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 21:40:49
>> OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS NARIN IM

[Captioner] 21:40:52

IMADI.
>> HI.


[Captioner] 21:40:55
MY NAME IS NARIN I.MADI

[Captioner] 21:40:58
.
I'M A RESIDENT OF CANYON HEIGHTS 
NEIGHBORHOOD.


[Captioner] 21:41:01
SO I SUPPORT THE LEASE

[Captioner] 21:41:04
, AND IN 
FACT MY FELLOW

[Captioner] 21:41:08
 CITIZENS KATE 
PARKER AND WILLIAM HAVE PUT

[Captioner] 21:41:11
 UP A -- SAID PRETTY NEATLY ABOUT 
THE

[Captioner] 21:41:14
 THINGS THAT I THOUGHT OF 
SAYING IN FACT.

[Captioner] 21:41:17

SO IT HAS TO BE, IN MY OPINION 
THIS

[Captioner] 21:41:20
 HAS TO BE WITH THE 
DISTRICT, THE CITY COUNCIL HAS 
OTHER

[Captioner] 21:41:24
 THINGS TO DO LIKE, YOU 
KNOW, IT IS NOT THAT

[Captioner] 21:41:27
 EAST BAY 
PARK DISTRICT IS VERY

[Captioner] 21:41:31
 WELL 
VERSED WITH HANDLING

[Captioner] 21:41:34
 THESE 
THINGS, THEY ARE ALREADY 
CONTROLLING THE OTHER PARKS.


[Captioner] 21:41:37
THEY ARE THE RIGHT PEOPLE.
IN FACT.
SO I

[Captioner] 21:41:40
 PREFER THAT THEY CAN TAKE 
THIS LEASE LIKE, YOU KNOW, AND

[Captioner] 21:41:43
 
ANOTHER THING IS LIKE WITH 
RESPECT TO PARK

[Captioner] 21:41:46
 HOURS, I THINK I 
RESPECT

[Captioner] 21:41:50
 YOU ALL THAT THE LEASE 
IS GOING TO BE SIGNED FOR TEN 
YEARS

[Captioner] 21:41:53
 OR 15 YEARS OR 20 YEARS.
THE TERMS OF PARKING HOURS

[Captioner] 21:41:56
 
SHOULD BE LOOSE.
BASICALLY BECAUSE THE REASON IS

[Captioner] 21:41:59
 
YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO 
HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE LIKE

[Captioner] 21:42:03
 WHY -- 
WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHY THERE 
IS A NEED FOR THE

[Captioner] 21:42:06
 PARK DISTRICT 
TO CHANGE FOR US.
IF

[Captioner] 21:42:10
 THERE IS EVEN A PANDEMIC LIKE 
WE SAW RECENTLY

[Captioner] 21:42:13
 IF IT HAPPENS 
LATER FOR SOME OTHER REASON 
THERE IS A NEED

[Captioner] 21:42:16
 FOR THE HOURS TO 
BE CHANGED EVEN IN CASE OF 
EMERGENCY

[Captioner] 21:42:19
 YOU CAN'T JUST GIVE 
ONE MONTH OR TWO MONTHS

[Captioner] 21:42:22
 UP FRONT 
TIME TO DISCUSS AND THEN 
NEGOTIATE

[Captioner] 21:42:26
 AND COME BACK AND 
CHANGE IT BY THE TIME THE TIME 
WILL

[Captioner] 21:42:29
 HAVE BEEN ALREADY PASSED.
THE OTHER THING IS WITH RESPECT

[Captioner] 21:42:32
 
TO THE PARKING LOT BUILD, 
BUILDING THE PARKING LOT,

[Captioner] 21:42:35
 I 
THINK IT SHOULD BE CONSTRUED, IT 
SHOULD THEN

[Captioner] 21:42:38
 BE COMPLETELY TOOK 
IT OFF BECAUSE IF THERE ARE 
PROBLEMS THAT NEED

[Captioner] 21:42:42
 TO BE SOLVED, 
IF THE PARKING IS A PROBLEM 
THERE WE SHOULD

[Captioner] 21:42:45
 BASICALLY SOLVE 
IT BY HAVING A PARKING LOT.
IN FACT THAT'S WHAT I

[Captioner] 21:42:48
 PREFER 
EVEN

[Captioner] 21:42:52
 HERE IN ALAMEDA CREEK WHEN 
THERE WAS AN INCREASE IN THE

[Captioner] 21:42:54
 
PEOPLE GOING IN THERE DURING THE 
PANDEMIC TIME I WOULD PREFER 


[Captioner] 21:42:58
THAT THEY HAVE --

[Captioner] 21:43:00

>> WE HAVE NO ADDITIONAL 
SPEAKERS.


[Captioner] 21:43:03
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.
AT THIS TIME I'M GOING TO CLOSE 
THE PUBLIC HEARING

[Captioner] 21:43:06
 OR PUBLIC 
COMMENTS ON THIS AND I'M GOING 
TO BRING IT BACK TO THE

[Captioner] 21:43:09
 COUNCIL 
FOR DISCUSSION.


[Captioner] 21:43:14
I'LL BEGIN WITH COUNCILMEMBER 
KASSAN.


[Captioner] 21:43:18
>> Councilmember Jones:   EXCUSE 
ME, MADAM MAYOR ARE WE PAST DUE 
FOR A

[Captioner] 21:43:22
 STENO CAPTIONER BREAK?
>> Mayor Mei:   WE COULD.
WE'LL TAKE

[Captioner] 21:43:25
 A QUIRK TEN-MINUTE 
BREAK AND THERE IS NO

[Captioner] 21:43:28
 OTHER 
PUBLIC SPEAKERS AT THIS TIME.
AND WHEN WE RETURN WE'LL BE 


[Captioner] 21:43:31
STRICTLY FOR THE COUNCIL.
I'M HAPPY TO DO THAT

[Captioner] 21:43:34
.
I THINK IT'S TRUE THANK YOU, SO 
WE'LL TAKE A QUICK

[Captioner] 21:43:37
 TEN-MINUTE 
BREAK.


[Captioner] 21:43:44
[ RECESS ]


>> MAYOR MEI: WE'RE RETURNING TO OUR CITY COUNCIL MEETING FOR DECEMBER 6TH, AND WE'VE HAD A DISCUSSION AND CONVERSATION, PUBLIC COMMENTS FROM THE

MISSION PEAK LEASE AGREEMENT AND WE'RE BRINGING IT BACK TO THE COUNCIL NOW FOR DISCUSSION AND WE'LL BEGIN WITH COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN.
>> COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN: THANK YOU.
I'M JUST REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT HOW THIS IS COMING BACK TO THE COUNCIL.
YOU KNOW, WHEN THE CITY OF FREMONT NEGOTIATES WITH ANYONE, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE WILL OBSERVE OUR BEHAVIOR IN OUR NEGOTIATIONS, AND LEARN FROM THAT BEHAVIOR, AND IN THIS CASE NOTHING HAS CHANGED EXCEPT WE WERE TOLD BY THE OTHER PARTY TO THE NEGOTIATIONS THAT THEY REFUSED TO DO ANY FURTHER NEGOTIATIONS.
AND I THINK IF THAT CHANGES OUR ORIGINAL DECISION, JUST THEIR, YOU KNOW, TELLING US THAT THEY WOULD NOT FURTHER NEGOTIATE WITH US, IF THAT CHANGES OUR ORIGINAL DECISION, THAT SENDS A REALLY BAD MESSAGE TO ANY PARTY THAT WE EVER NEGOTIATE WITH IN THE FUTURE.
I THINK WE NEED A MUCH BETTER REASON TO CHANGE OUR POSITION THAN THE OTHER PARTY SIMPLY SAYING SORRY, WE REFUSE TO CONTINUE NEGOTIATING, TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT. SO I THINK FOR THAT REASON ALONE WE SHOULD CERTAINLY CONTINUE TO VOTE NO ON THIS AS WE DID THE LAST TIME.
BUT IN ADDITION TO THAT, I JUST THINK THAT A LEASE THAT IS SO IMPORTANT AND HAS SO MANY IMPACTS ON OUR COMMUNITY, IT NEEDS TO BE SO MUCH MORE DETAILED.
I MEAN I'VE WORKED IN COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE, AND, YOU KNOW, MOST LEASES FOR COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE ARE 30 PAGES LONG AND THEY GO INTO A TON OF DETAIL ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS UNDER DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES.
AND, YOU KNOW, I DEFINITELY THINK WE COULD COME UP WITH A LEASE THAT WOULD BE REASONABLE FOR BOTH PARTIES.
BUT IT JUST NEEDS TO BE WAY MORE DETAILED, HAVE WAY MORE PROTECTIONS FOR PARTIES, AND NOT JUST BE BASED ON THE GOOD FAITH, THE REASONABLENESS.
SO I FEEL THAT THIS LEASE IS SO FAR FROM SOMETHING THAT I WOULD BE COMFORTABLE APPROVING.
AND CERTAINLY NOT JUST BECAUSE THE OTHER PARTY HAS TOLD US, YOU KNOW, SORRY, WE REFUSE TO CONTINUE TO NEGOTIATE.
SO I HOPE WE WILL VOTE AGAIN AS WE DID THE LAST TIME THIS WAS BROUGHT TO US, AGAINST THIS LEASE.
THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR MEI: THANK YOU.
NEXT IS COUNCILMEMBER JONES.
>> COUNCILMEMBER JONES: THANK YOU MADAM MAYOR.
YOU KNOW, AS ONE OF THE SPEAKERS BROUGHT UP EARLIER, THIS IS AN AGREEMENT THAT WE'VE HAD WITH EAST BAY REGIONAL PARKS FOR 44 YEARS NOW, 44 PLUS YEARS.
AND I DON'T RECALL, AND I'VE BEEN HERE IN FREMONT FOR MOST OF THOSE YEARS, AND WORKING THAT AREA, IN MY EARLY YEARS ON THE POLICE DEPARTMENT, I DON'T RECALL THE TYPES OF ISSUES THAT WE HAVE OR THE CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP TODAY. YOU KNOW, THIS IS SOMETHING IT IS SUCH AN AMENITY FOR NOT ONLY OUR RESIDENTS BUT FOR THE ENTIRE EAST BAY.

AND FOR PEOPLE WHO COME HERE FROM ALL OVER THE PLACE AND AGAIN, ALLUDING TO THE EARLIER SPEAKER, MR. PARKER, EAST BAY REGIONAL RUNS THE LARGEST PARK DISTRICT IN THE COUNTRY.
AND SO TO HAVE THAT TYPE OF REPUTATION, TO HAVE THOSE TYPE OF RESOURCES, TO HAVE THAT TYPE OF EXPERTISE IS SOMETHING THAT IS CERTAINLY A HUGE BENEFIT TO FREMONT. YOU KNOW, WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS NOW FOR MORE THAN TWO AND A HALF YEARS. AND, YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE TO REALIZE YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO MAKE EVERYONE HAPPY. IT'S JUST NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.
BUT YOU CAN ONLY DO WHAT IS THE BEST FOR THE MOST.
AND THAT TAKES INTO ACCOUNT ALL OF THE PEOPLE THAT VISIT THIS PARK ON A DAILY BASIS. OR THAT THEY LIVE IN THE EAST BAY, WHETHER THEY LIVE IN FREMONT, WHETHER THEY COME FROM OUT OF STATE, WHETHER THEY COME FROM ANOTHER COUNTRY.
IT IS AN AMENITY THAT WE ENJOY.
AND THE EAST BAY REGIONAL HAS DONE AN OUTSTANDING JOB OF MAINTAINING.
THE CONCERN IS, YOU KNOW, WE'VE STRUNG THIS ALONG FOR TWO AND A HALF YEARS.
AND IF I WERE IN THE PROCESS OF BUYING A HOUSE OR BUYING A BUSINESS AND SOMEBODY STRUNG ME ALONG FOR TWO AND A HALF YEARS I'D PROBABLY THINK ABOUT WALKING AWAY.
AND THAT'S NOT SOMETHING I THINK WE WANT TO SEE HAPPEN.
YOU KNOW, THIS IS SOMETHING THAT EVEN IF -- TAKE THE WORST CASE SCENARIO AND, YOU KNOW, WE END THIS LEASE WITH EAST BAY REGIONAL PARKS, WE DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES.
WE DON'T HAVE THE STAFFING.
WE DON'T HAVE THE FINANCIAL CAPABILITY OF MAINTAINING THIS PARK.
WE DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TO KEEP OUT THE TRESPASSERS THAT SOME OF THE RESIDENTS ARE COMPLAINING ABOUT.
YOU KNOW, I KNOW FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE HAVING SPENT THE NIGHT IN SOME OF OUR EAST BAY REGIONAL PARKS THAT THEY HAVE REGULAR PATROLS THAT COME THROUGH THEIR PARKS AND THEY MAKE SURE THAT EVERYTHING IS GOING SMOOTHLY.
THE POLICE DEPARTMENT DOESN'T HAVE THAT LUXURY.
NOT WITH THE CURRENT STAFFING LEVELS.
NOT WITH THE CURRENT CALLS FOR SERVICE, THOSE KINDS OF THINGS AND THEY DON'T HAVE THE EXPERTISE.
YOU KNOW, I DON'T SEE ANY OF THE OFFICERS NIGHT RIDING ON MOTORCYCLES UP AND DOWN THE HILLS OF MISSION PEAK WITHOUT GETTING THEMSELVES INTO SOME TROUBLE. THERE IS A LOT OF SPEECH.
THERE IS A LOT OF KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE MANAGEMENT OF THIS PARK.
IT'S A HUGE AMENITY FOR AGAIN NOT ONLY OUR COMMUNITY BUT THE ENTIRE EAST BAY AND BEYOND.
AND I THINK THAT WE NEED TO JUST PUT THIS TO BED AND MOVE TOWARD.
AND THERE HAVE BEEN SOME COMMENTS ABOUT THE LENGTH OF THE LEASE.
WE'VE DONE 20 OR 25-YEAR LEASES THROUGHOUT THE HISTORY OF THIS AGREEMENT WITH EAST BAY REGIONAL PARKS AND I FOR ONE WOULD NOT WANT TO SEE STAFF GO THROUGH A

FIVE YEAR LEASE AND SPEND TWO AND A HALF YEARS OF IT TRYING TO MODIFY THINGS TO APPEASE EVERY PERSON BECAUSE IT'S NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN.
SO I'LL BE CURIOUS TO SEE WHAT THE OTHER COUNCILMEMBERS HAVE TO SAY BUT I'M READY TO PUT FORWARD A MOTION TO MOVE THIS FORWARD, THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR MEI: THANK YOU.
BEFORE WE CONTINUE I KNOW WE ALSO HAVE ONE COUNCILMEMBER VIA ZOOM, I DON'T KNOW IF HE WANTED TO ADD ANYTHING, HIS HAND IS RAISED, I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE BEFORE I MOVE ON TO THE NEXT COUNCILMEMBER.
>> COUNCILMEMBER SHAO'S HAND IS RAISED.
>> MAYOR MEI: I WAS GOING TO SAY CAN WE CALL HIM.
>> COUNCILMEMBER SHAO: THANK YOU, ENHANCEMENT MAYOR.
I CONCUR WITH WHAT COUNCILMEMBER JONES JUST SAID ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS ORIGINAL PARK TO FREMONT.
THE COST OF MAINTAINING IT, THE HISTORY OF THE DISTRICT SERVICE THAT HAVE BEEN OFFERED TO US IN THE PAST.
AS WELL AS THE GOOD RELATIONSHIPS.
I UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN YOU TRY TO WORK WITH A BUSINESS PARTNER THAT YOU HAVE NEVER DEALT BEFORE, THERE'S NO MUTUAL TRUST AND YOU HAVE TO DO YOUR HOMEWORK AND TRY YOUR BEST TO MAKE SURE ALL THE TERMS IN THE AGREEMENT WOULD PROTECT YOU AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE.
WE ARE, ON THE OTHER HAND, TALKING ABOUT A PARTNER THAT'S BEEN WORKING WITH US FOR DECADES.
NOT ONLY FOR MISSION PEAK, BUT OTHER PROPERTIES REGIONAL PARKS, WITHIN FREMONT. SO BASED ON WHAT COUNCILMEMBER JONES HAVE JUST SAID, I'M ALSO SUPPORTIVE TO APPROVING THE LEASE.
TONIGHT.
THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR MEI: THANK YOU.
ARE THERE -- OKAY.
A MOTION THEN?
>> COUNCILMEMBER JONES:
RECOMMENDATION.
>> MAYOR MEI: AND THEN WE HAVE --
>> COUNCILMEMBER SHAO: I SECOND.
>> MAYOR MEI: A SECOND FROM COUNCILMEMBER SHAO.
SO WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND.
CAN WE HAVE A ROLL CALL VOTE PLEASE.
>> COUNCILMEMBER COX.
>> MAYOR MEI: SORRY, YOU'RE MUTED.
NO.
THERE.
>> COUNCILMEMBER COX: OKAY.
I STILL WOULD LIKE TO HAVE SOME QUESTIONS ANSWERED BEFORE WE GO THROUGH THE VOTE.
I WILL MAKE A MOTION TO APPROVE STAFF

I DIDN'T GET ALL MY QUESTIONS ANSWERED YET. I WAS THINKING ABOUT A COUPLE OF THINGS. >> MAYOR MEI: OKAY.
WELL I ALSO SEE COUNCILMEMBER KENG.
WERE YOU PLANNING TO MAKE A MOTION OR -- BECAUSE YOU'RE IN QUEUE BEFORE HER BUT -- THERE IS A MOTION AND SECOND ALSO ON THE FLOOR.
>> VICE MAYOR KENG: I WOULD LIKE TO MOVE FORWARD SO WE HAVE AN AGREEMENT BUT I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO SEE MORE EFFORTS TO PROMOTE AND MAKE SURE PEOPLE ARE PARKING AT THE OHLONE ENTRANCE.
I THINK RIGHT NOW WE HAVE -- HAVING THE DATA SHOWING THAT IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS THERE HASN'T REALLY BEEN A KIND OF PROGRESS MOVING VISITORS OVER TO THE OHLONE SITE.
AND I THINK WE -- IF WE CAN LIKE PUT IN THE CONTRACT THAT TO ADVERTISE MAYBE LIKE -- ADVERTISE THE OHLONE SITE AS THE MAIN ENTRANCE EVEN THOUGH WE ARE STILL KEEPING THE OTHER ENTRANCE OPEN.
BUT MAKING MORE OF AN EFFORT TO DIRECT PEOPLE THAT WAY.
>> MAYOR MEI: OKAY.
THANK YOU.
COUNCILMEMBER COX.
DID YOU HAVE CLARIFYING QUESTION?
OTHERWISE WE HAVE A MOTION AND SECOND.
>> COUNCILMEMBER COX: YES, I WOULD LIKE TO FIND OUT, AND IN TERMS OF -- I THINK THERE'S SOME THINGS THAT ARE MISUNDERSTOOD.
AND MAKING SURE THAT IF THERE'S ANY PARKING THAT IS GOING TO BE BUILT, THAT WE STILL HAVE TO APPROVE IT --
>> MAYOR MEI: WE DO.
>> COUNCILMEMBER COX: AS A CITY.
AND I THINK WHEN OTHERS HAVE MADE COMMENTS IN ADDRESSING SOME OF THE PUBLIC COMMENTS, IT STILL HAS TO FLOW THROUGH THE CITY PROCESS BEFORE ANYBODY CAN BUILD ON CITY PROPERTY.
THAT THEY HAVE TO HAVE FOLLOWED THE CITY OF FREMONT APPROVAL.
AND I JUST WANT TO ADDRESS A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN REPEATEDLY STATED, AND SOME OF THE COMMENTS TONIGHT, JUST TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND WHY WE'RE DOING WHAT WE'RE DOING.
AND ADDRESSING THAT 900 ACRES OF -- I'M SORRY, THE PARKING SPOT FOR 300 PARKING SPOTS, AT MISSION PEAK.
AND JUST TO REITERATE THAT, I KNOW THERE'S AN ATTACHMENT, THERE'S BEEN VERY DETAILED INFORMATION FROM THE STAFF, TO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE CONCERNS.
BUT I JUST WANT TO REITERATE THAT AS AN IMPORTANCE THAT'S PART OF OUR DUE PROCESS AS A CITY TO APPROVE THOSE TYPE OF EXAM IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS.
EVEN THOUGH THERE'S A SIDE LETTER WRITTEN, IT MAY NOT BE IN BEST TERMS AS LEGAL SOUND AS WE WOULD LIKE IT TO BE.
BUT THERE IS A LETTER, BUS THERE IS A PROCESS.

THAT ANY TYPE OF CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT HAS TO FOLLOW THE CITY OF FREMONT AND GET OUR APPROVAL FIRST.
SO JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE CLEAR ON THE PUBLIC COMMENTS, AND IF OUR CITY ATTORNEY WANTED TO SAY ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS THERE, THAT WOULD BE MOST HELPFUL TOO.
>> CTY. ATTNY. ALVARADO: SURE AS TO THE PARKING STRUCTURE AS THE STAFF REPORT INDICATES, SHOULD THE DISTRICT DESIRE TO BUILD THAT STRUCTURE, IT WOULD BE REQUIRED TO COME TO THE CITY FOR BOTH A GRADING AND A BUILDING PERMIT AND THE CITY WOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO DENY THAT REQUEST FOR PERMIT.
SO THE CITY DOES HAVE THE ABILITY TO DENY THAT PROJECT THROUGH THOSE BUILDING PERMITS.
IN ADDITION, TO THE SIDE LETTER THAT WAS OF COURSE RECEIVED, THEY'VE ALREADY MADE THE ASSURANCE BUT THE CITY DOES HAVE THE MECHANISM TO DENY THAT PROJECT. REGARDING OHLONE ENTRANCE THERE ARE A CUSTOM SECTION WITHIN THE STAFF REPORT THAT DOES ADDRESS THE OHLONE ENTRANCE, SECTION 13 SIGNS IN MARKETING THAT THE DISTRICT IS TO ESSENTIALLY PROMOTE THAT AS THE MAIN ENTRANCE VIA ITS WEBSITE AND PROMOTIONAL MATERIALS AND SECTION 14 SAYS THE PARTIES UNDER THE COOPERATION SECTION SAYS THE PARTIES WILL WORK TO PROMOTE THE OHLONE ENTRANCE AS THE PRIMARY ENTRANCE TO THE PRESERVE.
THERE ARE A COUPLE OF PROVISIONS THAT ADDRESS THAT ISSUE.
>> COUNCILMEMBER COX: RIGHT, TO SET OHLONE AS THE PRIMARY ENTRANCE.
AND THAT CAN'T BE DONE UNTIL THIS LEASE IS AGREED TO TONIGHT, IS THAT CORRECT? THAT'S HOW IT WOULD THEN BE IMPLEMENTED?
>> THEY'VE ALREADY ACTUALLY BEGUN DOING THAT BASED ON FEEDBACK THEY'VE RECEIVED FROM THE CITIZENS AND THE CITY.
OHLONE HAS BEEN PROMOTED AS THE PRIMARY ENTRANCE TO MISSION PEAK.
>> COUNCILMEMBER COX: OKAY, I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE, BECAUSE I'M HEARING SOME THINGS AND I WANT TO INTRODUCE THAT BEFORE WE TAKE A VOTE.
>> IT IS A STRONG INTEREST OF THE COUNCIL WE WANTED TO HAVE IT DOCUMENTED IN THE LEASE AGREEMENT AS WELL.
>> COUNCILMEMBER COX: EXACTLY, THANK YOU.
AND THE OTHER PART IS JUST MAKING SURE IT'S NOT CLEAR IN TERMS OF I KNOW WE HAVE A CLAUSE ON COOPERATION THAT WILL RESOLVE EVERYTHING, WORK THINGS OUT.
BUT THERE IS ALSO A PART THAT HOW WILL WE BE ABLE TO ADDRESS WHEN THERE'S ISSUES IN THE PARK, AND AS FAR AS THOSE THAT LIVE OUTSIDE OF THE MISSION PEAK AREA AND THOSE THAT LIVE INSIDE, RIGHT AROUND THAT AREA.
HOW WILL THEY BE BEST TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS?
IF THERE'S THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING WITH THE PARK THAT THEY'RE NOT -- THAT ARE NOT IN THE CONSTITUENTS EYES AS BEING GOOD FOR THAT AREA?
>> I'D FIRST LIKE TO REMIND EVERYONE THAT THE RESIDENTS OF TREATMENT ARE CONSTITUENTS OF EAST BAY REGIONAL PARK DISTRICT AS WELL AS, YOU KNOW, YOUR CONSTITUENTS.
>> COUNCILMEMBER COX: UH-HUH.

>> CITY MGR. SHACKELFORD: AND JUST LIKE RESIDENTS CONTACT YOU WITH ISSUES OR CONCERNS, THEY DO, YOU KNOW, DO THE SAME THING AND SHOULD DO THE SAME THING WITH EAST BAY REGIONAL PARK DISTRICT AND THEIR BOARD OF DIRECTORS.
AND JUST LIKE YOU TOLL UP ON THOSE ITEMS AND ISSUES, SO DO THEY.
>> COUNCILMEMBER COX: OKAY.
>> CITY MGR. SHACKELFORD: AND THEY'RE WELCOME TO TALK WITH US AS WELL AND OF COURSE WE'LL, YOU KNOW, ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS WITH THE PARK DISTRICT AS WELL. SO THERE ARE A NUMBER OF AVENUES.
>> COUNCILMEMBER COX: OKAY.
AND I ALSO SEE IN THE HOURS OF OPERATION THAT THERE IS A 30-DAY NOTIFICATION THAT IS NOTIFIED THE CITY, 30 DAYS BEFORE THEY CHANGE ANY HOURS.
AND ALSO, THAT THE CITY MAY CHOOSE TO HOLD A CITY MEETING AS A WAY OF ADDRESSING AND HAVING A DISCUSSION.
SO I'M JUST TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE THAT ARE OUT THERE, THAT ARE CONCERNED AND I APPRECIATE ALL OF THE E-MAILS, THE PHONE CALLS, RELATING TO THE MISSION PEAK LEASE AGREEMENT, THAT THERE ARE SOME AVENUES THAT CAN BE ADDRESSED, AND THAT THE PUBLIC CAN SPEAK.
AND THIS PARK IS FOR EVERYONE.
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE EVERYBODY HAS ACCESS TO THE PARK AND THAT YOU EITHER GO TO OHLONE SIDE AS THE PREFERRED ENTRANCE TO GO AND VISIT MISSION PEAK, THE OTHER PART THAT I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IS TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THIS PIECE IS THAT THIS LEASE AGREEMENT NEVER WENT TO THE EAST BAY PARK BOARD OF DIRECTORS, IS THAT WHAT I'M UNDERSTANDING?
BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WAS ON THE AGENDA FOR SOMETIME IN DECEMBER TO HAVE THIS LEASE AGREEMENT REVIEWED AND DISCUSSED AT AN UPCOMING MEETING FOR THE EAST BAY BOARD OF DIRECTORS.
SO IT'S KIND OF A LITTLE SHOCK THAT IT CAME BACK SOONER AND IT WAS BASICALLY MORE OF THE STAFF THAT HAD ADVISED THE STAFF, YOU, THE CITY MANAGER OR CITY STAFF, OF FREMONT.
>> CITY MGR. SHACKELFORD: CORRECT.
>> COUNCILMEMBER COX: THAT THIS IS THE POSITION THEY WERE TAKING AT EAST BAY PARK.
>> CITY MGR. SHACKELFORD: CORRECT.
>> COUNCILMEMBER COX: SO I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT WAS CLEAR.
THE ONLY OTHER ONE THAT I WANTED TO FIND OUT A LITTLE BIT MORE WAS THAT EVEN THOUGH THERE'S NOT NECESSARILY A MECHANISM TO REVIEW THE PERFORMANCE OF THE EAST BAY, DO WE IN THE CITY HAVE ANY OTHER PERFORMANCE INDICATORS TO KNOW EXCUSE ME HOW WELL THIS LEASE IS WORKING?
I KNOW IT'S BEING MANAGED BY THE EAST BAY PARK DISTRICT, BUT IS THERE THINGS THAT YOU'RE MEASURING, IS IT MORE LIKE HOW MANY ISSUANCE OF CODE ENFORCEMENT AND PARKING CITATIONS THAT ARE ISSUED TO KNOW IF IT'S GOOD, BAD, OR IS IT MORE OF THE COMPLAINTS THAT WE AS CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS RECEIVE OVER TIME?

HOW ARE YOU, YOU KNOW, IF THERE'S NO OTHER MECHANISM TO UNDERSTAND HOW WELL EAST BAY IS PERFORMING OR, YOU KNOW, YOU COULD HAVE YOUR TOWN HALL MEETINGS, THAT IS ONE GAUGE, I GET THAT.
BUT WHAT OTHER MECHANISMS DO WE HAVE TO KNOW HOW WELL THE PARK IS GOING TO BE MANAGED, AND JUST MAKING SURE THAT IS THERE SOME TRACKING OR SOME WAY THAT WE WOULD BE WATCHING OUT OR THE THIS?
>> CITY MGR. SHACKELFORD: SUZANNE CAN YOU RESPOND TO THAT PLEASE?
>> CERTAINLY.
THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION.
WE MEET AS A GROUP WITH REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE CITY COUNCIL AND THE BOARD MEMBERS THROUGH LIAISON COMMITTEE.
AND THAT'S A SPACE WHERE WE DISCUSS ISSUES THAT COME UP FROM ALL OF OUR SITES THROUGHOUT THE -- WE HAVE SEVEN REGIONAL PARK SITES IN FREMONT.
WE'RE VERY GRATEFUL TO HAVE THAT MANY SITES HERE THAT WE DISCUSS AT OUR LIAISON COMMITTEE MEETINGS AND IF THERE IS AN ISSUE THAT WE NEED TO DISCUSS OR AN ITEM THAT COMES UP THAT WE WANT TO ADDRESS THE PUBLIC COMES TO SPEAK TO THAT LIAISON COMMITTEE AND WE ADDRESS ITEMS THAT WE FEEL ARE IMPORTANT TO AGENDIZE AS A MUTUAL AGREED UPON TOPIC.
SIMILAR TO THE WAY WE ADDRESS ISSUES AT THE FREMONT UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT IN BOARD MEETINGS AND IT WOULD BE VERY SIMILAR IN THE WAY WE IDENTIFY JOINT TOPICS. >> COUNCILMEMBER COX: OKAY.
AND HOW OFTEN DO YOU MEET WITH THE LIAISON COMMITTEE?
>> WE'RE SUPPOSED TO MEET TWICE A YEAR.
AND IT REALLY DEPENDS ON HOW HEAVY THE TOPICS ARE IF WE HAVE TOPICS OF INTEREST THAT COME FORWARD AND THAT'S HOW IT'S BEEN DETERMINED SO FAR.
>> COUNCILMEMBER COX: OKAY.
AND SO YOU REPRESENT FREMONT AND THEN WHO WOULD BE THE PARALLEL ON THE SIDE OF THE EAST BAY?
>> SO COUNCILMEMBER JONES HAS BEEN OUR REPRESENTATIVE FOR THE CITY OF FREMONT ON THE LIAISON COMMITTEE.
AND THERE'S TWO BOARD MEMBERS THAT SIT ON THE REPRESENTATION FROM EAST BAY REGIONAL PARKS DISTRICT AND THEN A REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE CREATION COMMISSION ALSO SITS AS A REPRESENTATIVE.
>> COUNCILMEMBER COX: OKAY.
AND DO YOU PUBLISH MEETING MINUTES AND REPORTS FROM YOUR MEETINGS?
I ASSUME YOU DO SINCE IT'S A PUBLIC --
>> YES.
>> COUNCILMEMBER COX: OKAY AND WHERE CAN PEOPLE FIND THAT INFORMATION?
>> THE SAME PLACE THAT WE PUBLISH ALL OF OUR MEETING NOTES AND THAT COMES FROM THE CLERK'S OFFICE.
>> COUNCILMEMBER COX: OKAY BUT IT IS PUBLICIZED SOMEWHERE ON THE WEBSITE THAT WE CAN GET A LINK TO ON -- BECAUSE I WANT TO BE ABLE TO RESPOND TO SOME OF THE CONSTITUENTS THAT HAVE BEEN SO KIND TO SPEND TIME TO WRITE TO US, THAT WE WANT

TO BE ABLE TO REDIRECT WHERE THEY CAN FOLLOW UP AND HAVE ACTIONS AND BE ABLE TO FEEL COMFORTABLE THAT THEY CAN HAVE A VOICE IN CARRYING THAT OUT.
AND I HAVE -- LET ME JUST CHECK ONE MORE TIME HERE.
AND IF WE JUST REFRESH, I'M SORRY WE'VE TALKED SO MUCH, JUST TO REFRESH ON IF WE GO MONTH TO MONTH, THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT IT WOULD JUST BE A MONTH TO MONTH TYPE OF ARRANGEMENT, THERE IS NOTHING BINDING ON ANY TYPE OF LEASE AGREEMENT.
WHEN YOU ARE SAYING MONTH TO MONTH, THEY ARE JUST MAINTAINING IT ON A MONTH TO MONTH BASIS.
JUST TO REITERATE WHAT THAT MEANS.
I KNOW THAT WAS ONE OF THE OPTIONS THAT WAS PRESENTED IN THE STAFF REPORT.
>> CTY. ATTNY. ALVARADO:
THE LEASE THAT EXPIRED.
>> COUNCILMEMBER COX:
>> CTY. ATTNY. ALVARADO:
WE'RE PROPOSING NOW OR COME UP WITH SOME OTHER PLAN. BUT IT BASICALLY IS JUST MAINTAINING THE STATUS QUO.
>> COUNCILMEMBER COX: OKAY.
AND I KNOW FROM THE NOVEMBER 15TH MEETING, THERE WAS SOME ADDITIONS MADE AND CHANGES BASED ON SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT WERE PLACED LAST DECEMBER, 2021, THAT ROLLED INTO THE AGREEMENT THAT WAS DISCUSSED ON THE NOVEMBER 15TH CITY COUNCIL MEETING THAT THERE WERE SOME CONCESSIONS MADE IN THAT PART.
>> CTY. ATTNY. ALVARADO: THAT IS CORRECT.
THERE WERE CHANGES MADE AND IMPLEMENTED BETWEEN THE LAST MEETING WE HAD IN NOVEMBER AND THE PRIOR TIME THE CITY COUNCIL CONSIDERED IT IN LATE 2021.
>> COUNCILMEMBER COX: OKAY.
AND AT THIS POINT, EAST BAY REGIONAL PARK IS SAYING THAT THEY ARE NOT WILLING TO TALK ANY FURTHER ABOUT THIS LEASE AGREEMENT, IS THAT WHAT THE BOTTOM LINE IS HERE?
>> CITY MGR. SHACKELFORD: THAT'S CORRECT.
>> COUNCILMEMBER COX: AND THERE WAS NO OPPORTUNITY OF ANY OTHER DISCUSSION? BECAUSE I WAS SO LOOKING FORWARD TO HAVING A WORKING GROUP MEETING, AND, YOU KNOW, IRONING OUT SOME OF THESE OTHER THINGS THAT WERE MORE DETAILED.
BUT AT THIS POINT, THEY'RE SAYING NO, WE WANT -- TAKE THE LEASE OR GO TO MONTH-TO- MONTH.
>> CITY MGR. SHACKELFORD: AND THEY'RE SAYING THEY'RE NOT INTERESTED IN NEGOTIATING ANY FURTHER AND THEY FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE MADE CONCESSIONS, AS HAVE WE.
AND THIS IS WHERE WE ARE.
IT MEANS THAT WE CONTINUE TO CARRY OVER THE TERMS OF
OKAY.
UNTIL SUCH A TIME THAT WE EITHER CREATE A NEW LEASE AS
OKAY.
>> COUNCILMEMBER COX:
OKAY.
>> CTY. ATTNY. ALVARADO:
>> COUNCILMEMBER COX:
WAS TRYING TO EXPRESS IN MY QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS.
I THINK YOUR MIC MIGHT BE OFF COUNCILMEMBER COX.
THAT THERE ARE DIFFERENT AVENUES ON THIS CONTRACT THAT I

BUT ALSO THERE IS THE TERMINATION THAT EITHER PARTY CAN GIVE TO EACH OTHER IF IT'S NOT WORKING WITH A 30 DAY NOTICE.
SO WE'RE NEVER LOCKED IN TO AN AGREEMENT.
THERE'S ALWAYS THE WAY OF TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE.
AND IF THERE'S A PROBLEM THEY HAVE 30 DAYS TO BE ABLE TO CURE THAT, IS THAT CORRECT?
TO OUR CITY ATTORNEY?
ALVARADO?
>> CTY. ATTNY. ALVARADO: IF YOU REFER TO SECTION 15 THAT TALKS ABOUT TERMINATION OF THE LEASE UNDER SUBDIVISION C YOU'RE CORRECT THAT THE LEASE CAN BE TERMINATED UNDER 30 DAYS NOTICE.
AND IF THERE IS A MATERIAL BREACH, THE FATHERS HAVE 90 DAYS TO CURE.
OTHERWISE THE CITY COULD ALSO TERMINATE.
BUT THAT OF COURSE DOESN'T PRECLUDE THE PARTIES FROM COOPERATING UNDER SECTION 14 TO TRY TO RESOLVE THOSE CONCERNS BEFORE IT GETS TO THAT POINT.
SO THERE'S AN ADDITIONAL MECHANISM TO HAVE DISCUSSION BEFORE ANYONE IS ISSUING OFFICIAL LEASES, OFFICIAL NOTICES UNDER THE LEASE.
>> COUNCILMEMBER COX: THANK YOU FOR CLARIFYING THAT AND CONFIRMING THAT PART.
OKAY.
I'M NOW READY TO VOTE AND YOU COULD STILL HEAR ME.
I'M GOING TO SAY YES.
AYE.
>> MAYOR MEI: OKAY, THANK YOU.
I THINK WE HAVE A MOTION AND SECOND, AND I SEE THAT MORE PEOPLE HAVE ADDED SINCE THEN.
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN DID YOU HAVE SOMETHING ELSE TO ADD OR -- YOUR MIC IS OFF. SORRY, THANK YOU.
>> COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN: THANK YOU, MADAM MAYOR.
JUST WANT TO MAKE SOME QUICK COMMENTS.
I DO BELIEVE THAT, YOU KNOW, WE'VE COME A LONG WAYS FROM THE EITHER DAYS WHEN WE HAD A LOT OF PARKING ISSUES, LOT OF SAFETY AS WELL AS BLIGHT TYPE ISSUES.
AND SO I THINK AT THIS POINT, WE HAVE TO WORK IN GOOD FAITH, AND, YOU KNOW, WE HAVE A NEW DIRECTOR AT THE EAST BAY PARK DISTRICT AND WE MADE SOME GOOD INROADS.
WE ALSO HAVE DEPUTY CHIEF LANCE BREED WHO IS ALSO FROM THE PARK DISTRICT SO WE DO HAVE SOME I DON'T WANT TO SAY BACK DOOR BUT WAYS TO INTERACT WITH THE PARK DISTRICT.
AND IN GENERAL THE PARK DISTRICT HAS DONE A GOOD JOB.
THIS IS ONE AREA WHERE THE INTERFACE WITH THE RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD AND THE PARK DISTRICT HAS BEEN A CONCERN.
AND I THINK IN ALL OF THIS WE'RE LOOKING FOR BALANCE.
WE'RE TRYING TO BALANCE THE HARM TO MAKE SURE THAT THE NEIGHBORHOOD COMMUNITY IS -- THEIR NEEDS ARE ADDRESSED, MAKE SURE THE PARK DISTRICT IS GOOD

STEWARD AND MAKE SURE THAT THE ISSUES RELATED TO THE PARK ARE ADEQUATELY ADDRESSED.
AND I THINK LAST TIME WHEN WE WERE HERE WE HAD THE THREE ISSUES, THE ONE WITH THE PARKING, I THINK THAT HAS BEEN SATISFIED IN THE SENSE THAT IF ANY PARKING LOT NEEDS TO BE BUILT IT REQUIRES CITY APPROVAL.
THE OTHER WAS THE HOURS.
THE HOURS, WE JUST HAVE TO HAVE GOOD FAITH AND TRUST THAT THE PARK DISTRICT WILL BE A WILLING PARTNER, AND TRY TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS OF OUR RESIDENTS WHICH ARE ALSO CONSTITUENTS OF THE PARK DISTRICT.
AND HOPEFULLY, THE LIAISON COMMITTEE WILL ALLOW US TO CHANNEL SOME OF THOSE ISSUES AND CONCERNS.
WE ALSO HAVE A NEW EAST BAY PARK DIRECTOR WHICH I THINK WE SHOULD ALSO TRY TO INCLUDE IN THAT COMMITTEE AND ALSO HOPEFULLY THE COMMUNITY CAN ALSO REACH OUT TO THE NEW PARK DIRECTOR WHO IS WILLING TO COME BY THE WAY AND MEET WITH EVERYONE.
AND HOPEFULLY, COMMUNITY MEMBERS CAN EDUCATE HER ABOUT THE ISSUES AND CONCERNS THEY HAVE AND HAVE A FRIENDLY EAR EARLY ON SO THEY CAN HELP ADVOCATE FOR THE ISSUES THAT THEY'RE FACING.
SO WITH THAT I THINK IN GOOD FAITH AND, YOU KNOW, BEING A WILLING PARTNER WE HAVE TO WORK WITH OUR NEIGHBORING AGENCIES.
THE PARK DISTRICT IS THE BIGGEST PARK DISTRICT IN THE COUNTRY AND SO I THINK IT'S IN OUR INTEREST TO TRY TO WORK WELL WITH THEM, TO HAVE FAITH AND TRY TO SEE HOW WE CAN IMPROVE SOME OF THE SHORTCOMINGS WE HAD IN THE PAST AND TRY TO BUILD FOR A STRONGER FUTURE SO WITH THAT I'M READY TO VOTE AS WELL.
THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR MEI: OKAY GREAT, THANK YOU.
AND COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN YOU PRESSED AGAIN OR -- WE HAVE A MOTION AND SECOND, STILL.
>> COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN: I'M FINE, THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR MEI: OKAY.
WELL, I'D LIKE TO ASK FOR A ROLL CALL VOTE AND WE'LL BEGIN AGAIN PLEASE.
>> COUNCILMEMBER JONES: >> MAYOR MEI: YES PLEASE. >> COUNCILMEMBER JONES: RECOMMENDATION.
DO YOU NEED ME TO REPEAT THE MOTION?
SO I MOVE THAT WE GO FORWARD WITH STAFF
TO CLARIFY A 20 YEAR LEASE.
>> COUNCILMEMBER SHAO:
>> MAYOR MEI: I HAVE A MOTION AND SECOND. ROLL CALL LEASE.
>> COUNCILMEMBER COX, COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN. >> COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN: AYE. COUNCILMEMBER SHAO.
>> COUNCILMEMBER SHAO: AYE.
>> COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, NO.
I SECOND.

>> THE CLERK:
>> THE CLERK:
>> MAYOR MEI:
THE MOTION PASSES WITH ONE ANYWAY NAY, COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN. ARE THERE ANY REPORT-OUTS FROM COMMITTEE MEETINGS? COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN DID YOU JUST PRESS FOR A REPORT-OUT.
>> COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN: YES, FOR THE EAST BAY LEAGUE OF CITIES.
WE HAD A STRATEGY SESSION TO COME UP WITH A CALENDAR FOR THE NEXT YEAR.
AND SO I'LL HOPEFULLY HAVE ALL OF YOU GET E-MAILS FROM SAM SO THAT SHE CAN UPDATE YOU SO YOU CAN JOIN FUTURE EVENTS.
WE HAVE SO MANY THINGS PLANNED OVER THE COURSE OF NEXT YEAR.
AND WE ALSO HAVE A NEW COUNCILMEMBER WHO IS GOING TO BE JOINING US SOON.
SO WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE SHE'S IN TOUCH WITH THAT.
SO WE'D LOVE TO GET ALL OF YOU INVOLVED AND BE A PART OF THAT.
THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR MEI: THANK YOU FOR REPRESENTING AND I DO THINK THAT LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CAL CITIES DOES A GREAT JOB IN TERMS OF SAM IN PARTICULAR CAHILL FOR BEING A REPRESENTATIVE AND MAKING SURE THAT WE HAVE GOOD PULSE THIS TERMS OF THE REGIONAL ISSUES AND CONCERNS AS WELL AS POLICIES.
AND IN DOING SO BEFORE I THINK WE MENTIONED IT EARLIER AND IN ACKNOWLEDGMENT I JUST WANTED TO MENTION THAT FOR EAST BAY REGIONAL PARKS WHICH HAS BEEN A LONG CONVERSATION THIS EVENING BUT THAT COUNCILMEMBER JONES WAS A REPRESENTATIVE AND I KNOW THAT COUNCILMEMBER COX HAS ALSO BEEN THE ALTERNATE FOR THAT SO I APPRECIATE THAT.
AND THEN I ALSO WANTED TO THANK SINCE YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT EAST BAY REPRESENTS FOR LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES COUNCILMEMBER JONES ALSO FOR HIS MANY YEARS OF SERVICE IN THAT AREA.
BECAUSE THE MEETINGS DO ROTATE IN TERMS OF LOCATION.
SO COUNCILMEMBER KENG DID YOU HAVE A REPORT-OUT?
>> VICE MAYOR KENG: YES MA'AM, SO EARLIER THIS WEEK I WAS INVITED TO JOIN AN ENERGY SUMMIT AT THE STATE CAPITOL WITH -- AT THE ENERGY COMMISSION.
SO WE HEARD A LOT ABOUT OFFSHORE WIND ENERGY, SO THIS WOULD BE COMING IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS AS CALIFORNIA ACTUALLY IS PRETTY BEHIND IN HAVING, YOU KNOW, THESE OFFSHORE WIND INDUSTRY KIND OF LIKE INSTALLATIONS.
COMPARED TO EAST COAST WHICH.
>> CITY ATTORNEY LEVINE: HAD ALREADY HAD A LOT OF COLLABORATIONS WITHIN -- WITH THE DIFFERENT STATES.
AND IT WAS GREAT TO SEE THAT AT THE STATE LEGISLATURE THEY ACTUALLY HAVE RECEIVED A LOT OF BIPARTISAN SUPPORT FOR THE OFFSHORE WIND ENERGY.
SO IT WILL BE PRETTY EXCITING TO SEE THAT WE HAVE, YOU KNOW, OTHER ENERGY SOURCES AS WE, YOU KNOW, NEED TO BE MORE MINDFUL.
THIS IS ONE OF THE TOP ISSUES THAT WE WILL BE FOCUSING ON IN THE COMING YEARS. THANK YOU.
>> MAYOR MEI: THANK YOU.
COUNCILMEMBER KENG, AYE. MAYOR MEI.
AYE.

I WANTED JUST TO ECHO AND I KNOW THAT FREMONT IS FORTUNATE TO BE BURGEONING AS MANY OF THESE INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES.
AND SO THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO SERVE AND REPRESENT US ON THIS PAST WEEK IS ON INNOVATION TECHNOLOGY COMMITTEE FOR THE U.S. CONFERENCE OF MAYORS WHERE I WAS IN A CONVERSATION WITH MAYOR BIB AS WELL AS MAYOR SUAREZ, TALKING ABOUT THESE TECHNOLOGIES IN PARTICULAR AS WE HAVE CHALLENGES FOR THE RENTAL ASSISTANCE AND ONE OF THE OTHER SPEAKERS WAS RINO WHICH WAS FOCUSED ON SOME OF THE OPTIONS FOR PEOPLE TO HAVE ACCESS IN LIEU OF SECURITY DEPOSITS AND THAT INCLUDES RENTAL HOUSING INSURANCE OPTION.
AND THEY'VE MADE SOME INCREDIBLE INROADS IN THAT AREA IN PROVIDING THOSE OPTIONS SO IT ALLOWS FOR THE CONVERSATION THAT WE HAD TODAY, TALKING ABOUT ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING, IN A PARTICULAR NOT BEING AS CONSTRAINT BASED OFF OF HAVING THE SECURITY DEPOSIT, AND CERTAINLY WOULD ECHO THE CONVERSATION ON CLEAN ENERGY AND OFFSHORE WINDS.
THAT'S, WIND USAGE I KNOW THAT IN THE EAST COAST MANY OF THE CITIES ESPECIALLY ON THOSE BORDERING ON THE SHORELINES HAVE BEEN UTILIZING AND EXPLORING THOSE CONVERSATIONS.
I ALSO WANTED TO THANK SOME OF MY COUNCILMEMBERS FOR JOINING ME TODAY.
WE HAD THE OPENING OF PERSONALIS AND WE HAVE REALLY DONE, AND I HAVE TO THANK OUR STAFF OUR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT TEAM OUR PERMITTING AS WELL AS OUR FIRE DEPARTMENT FOR THE SUPPORT IN MAKING SURE THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO HELP WITH THE EXPANSION.
AND SO IT WAS TO REIMAGINE, REUTILIZE A SPACE THAT WE HAD IN THE ARDENWOOD NORTH FREMONT AREA AND I WAS JOINED BY COUNCILMEMBER KENG OR VICE MAYOR KENG AND ALSO COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN TODAY IN THAT CONVERSATION.
AND IT IS VERY EXCITING FOR US TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THAT FLEX-SPACE WHICH MAKES IT UNIQUE IN THIS OPPORTUNITY AND TIME TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS MANUFACTURING AND ALSO REALLY COALESCE AND EXPAND ON OUR LIFE SCIENCES AND MANUFACTURING IN THOSE AREAS.
AND THAT ONE ALLOWS YOU TO, THEIR QUOTE AND TAG LINE I BELIEVE IS TO SEE THE FUTURE, OR SEE THE NEEDS I THINK AND SO YOU ARE ABLE TO HAVE BETTER PERSONALIZED TUMOR ACCESSING SOLUTIONS AS WELL AS TO BE ABLE TO ATTEST AND BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THOSE.
IT IS SOMETHING THAT UNFORTUNATELY, CANCER TOUCHES SO MANY OF OUR LIVES SO I'M VERY EXCITED TO SEE THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO BE ON THE FOREFRONT.
I KNOW TOMORROW IN FREMONT WE ARE ALSO HOSTING BIOCOM IN THAT CONVERSATION TO TALK ABOUT OTHER DOWNTOWN EVENT CENTER AND TO HIGHLIGHT AND IT'S BEEN ONE OF OUR KEY AREAS IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THAT ON OUR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT THINK SILICON VALLEY'S WEBSITE THAT FOCUSES ON SOME OF THE LIFE SCIENCES AND THE INCREDIBLE ADVANCEMENTS THAT WE'VE MADE.
I'M PROUD OF THE FACT THAT IN THE PAST SIX YEARS WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO GO FROM 75 BIOMEDICAL COMPANIES TO OVER 151.

SO IT REALLY ALLOWS US IN THIS MOMENT OF THE PANDEMIC AND WELLNESS CHALLENGES TO BE REALLY A LEADER IN THE BAY AREA AND ALSO IN THE REGION OF SAN FRANCISCO AND TRULY IN THE NATION IN TERMS OF DELIVERING THIS CARE.
SO I WANTED TO THANK OUR STAFF FOR MAKING THAT POSSIBLE.
I ALSO WANTED TO MENTION, WHEN WE TALKED ABOUT TODAY ABOUT ACCESS, THAT ALAMEDA COUNTY TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION, AGAIN WE TALKED ABOUT SOME OF THE PROJECTS, THE CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PLANS AND ALSO HAVING THE RACIAL EQUITY LENS AND LOOKING AT THAT.
AND SO THE PROJECTS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT TODAY HAVE BEEN ONES THAT HAVE BEEN AT THE FOREFRONT AND THAT WE HAVE BEEN CONTINUING TO PUSH IN TERMS OF REPRESENTATION.
I WANTED TO THANK COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN FOR SERVING ON THAT WITH ME, FOR THE TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION.
AND SO IN CLOSING, I JUST WANTED TO THANK ALL, I WOULD LIKE TO PAUSE FOR JUST A MOMENT OF SILENCE FOR WORLD AIDS TODAY, BECAUSE THE FACT THAT THERE HAVE BEEN SO MANY PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN IMPACTED BY THAT.
IF WE COULD JUST PAUSE FOR A MOMENT OF SILENCE.
THANK YOU.
[ MOMENT OF SILENCE ]
>> MAYOR MEI: THANK YOU SO IN CLOSING I JUST WANT TO WISH ALL TO BE WELL TO BE SAFE TO BE JUST TO BE KIND AND TO BE THANKFUL FOR EVERYTHING WE HAVE IN OUR COMMUNITIES.
HAVE A GOOD EVENING.
