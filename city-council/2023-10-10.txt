 FREMONT.GOV.
I'D LIKE TO ANNOUNCE THAT THE MEETING WILL GO UP UNTIL 11:30 P.M. THIS 

[Captioner] 19:02:03
EVENING IF NEEDED AND WE'LL ALLOW FOR 30 MINUTES OF GENERAL PUBLIC COMMENT IN THE BEGINNING, AND IF

[Captioner] 19:02:07
 THERE ARE ADDITIONAL SPEAKERS FOR ORAL COMMUNICATIONS AFTER THE INITIAL 30 MINUTES, WE

[Captioner] 19:02:11
 WILL TAKE ADDITIONAL SPEAKERS AT THE END OF THE MEETING IF TIME

[Captioner] 19:02:15
 REMAINS.
I WILL NOW TURN THE MEETING OVER TO OUR CITY MANAGER,

[Captioner] 19:02:19
 KARENA SHACKELFORD, TO MAKE ANY ANNOUNCEMENTS AND INTRODUCE HER STAFF AT THIS TIME.


[Captioner] 19:02:23
THANK YOU.
>> City Mgr. Shackelford: THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR, AND

[Captioner] 19:02:27
 GOOD EVENING TO YOU AND MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL.
SO

[Captioner] 19:02:32
 BEFORE I INTRODUCE MY COLLEAGUES, I JUST WANT TO MAKE A QUICK ANNOUNCEMENT

[Captioner] 19:02:36
 TO REITERATE WHAT WE'VE ALREADY PUT OUT THERE PUBLICLY, SO THIS EVENING

[Captioner] 19:02:40
 AS WE COMMENCE THIS MEETING, I JUST WANTED TO TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ACKNOWLEDGE

[Captioner] 19:02:45
 THAT THE CITY OF FREMONT HAS ENDED ITS PRACTICE OF ALLOWING

[Captioner] 19:02:49
 VIRTUAL PUBLIC COMMENT BY PHONE AND ZOOM DURING COUNCIL MEETINGS.


[Captioner] 19:02:55
WE TAKE THIS ACTION IN RESPONSE TO A TROUBLING WAVE OF ABUSE OF

[Captioner] 19:02:59
 VIRTUAL COMMENT, ONE IN WHICH SEVERAL OF OUR NEIGHBORING CITIES, CITY

[Captioner] 19:03:04
 COUNCILS AND REGIONAL ELECTED DECISION-MAKING BODIES HAVE BEEN SUBJECTED TO

[Captioner] 19:03:08
 DISRUPTIVE RACIST VERBAL ATTACKS BY ANONYMOUS CALLERS.
UNFORTUNATELY,

[Captioner] 19:03:13
 ELIMINATING VIRTUAL PUBLIC COMMENTS ENTIRELY IS THE ONLY

[Captioner] 19:03:17
 FEASIBLE OPTION TO PREVENT OUR MEETINGS FROM BECOMING A MEANS OF

[Captioner] 19:03:21
 BROADCASTING DISRUPTIVE, TROUBLING HATE SPEECH.


[Captioner] 19:03:25
REGULARLY SCHEDULED COUNCIL MEETINGS WILL CONTINUE TO BE BROADCAST ON ZOOM ON

[Captioner] 19:03:30
 FREMONT.GOV, AND OUR CABLE TELEVISION CHANNEL 27.
MEMBERS OF

[Captioner] 19:03:34
 THE PUBLIC MAY STILL WATCH MEETINGS REMOTELY AND ARE WELCOME TO

[Captioner] 19:03:38
 SUBMIT PUBLIC COMMENTS IN ADVANCE OF COUNCIL MEETINGS VIA

[Captioner] 19:03:42
 EMAIL.
ALL EMAIL COMMENTS RECEIVED BY 4:00 P.M. ON THE DAY OF THE

[Captioner] 19:03:46
 COUNCIL MEETING WILL BE DISTRIBUTED TO COUNCIL MEMBERS AND PUBLISHED IN THE

[Captioner] 19:03:50
 CITY'S AGENDA CENTER ON

[Captioner] 19:03:55
 FREMONT.GOV IN ADVANCE OF THE MEETING.
SO THAT COMPLETES MY ANNOUNCEMENT,

[Captioner] 19:03:59
 AND I'LL TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO INTRODUCE MY COLLEAGUES.
WE

[Captioner] 19:04:03
 HAVE RAFAEL ALVARADO, OUR CITY ATTORNEY WITH US THIS EVENING, SUSAN GAUTHIER,

[Captioner] 19:04:08
 OUR CITY CLERK,

[Captioner] 19:04:12
 AND KHANH VO, OUR I.T. SPECIALIST HELPING US OUT THIS EVENING.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:04:16
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
SO AT THIS TIME, I'D LIKE TO ALSO

[Captioner] 19:04:22
 SHARE THAT I NOTICE WE HAVE SEVERAL SIGNS IN THE AUDIENCE

[Captioner] 19:04:26
 AND THAT'S FINE, BUT DURING THE SPEAKERS, I WANTED TO NOTE THAT WE NEED TO MAKE

[Captioner] 19:04:30
 SURE PEOPLE CAN SEE, SO PLEASE DO NOT LIFT THE SIGNS UP SO THAT PEOPLE DON'T

[Captioner] 19:04:34
 HAVE AN OBSTRUCTED VIEW AND PLEASE DON'T WAVE THEM IN THE MIDDLE OF THE

[Captioner] 19:04:39
 SPEECH, BUT YOU'RE WELCOME TO HAVE THEM.
ALSO I WANTED

[Captioner] 19:04:44
 TO NOTE AT THIS TIME THE CONSENT CALENDAR ARE ITEMS THAT WILL BE PASSED WITH ONE COUNCIL VOTE

[Captioner] 19:04:48
 AND STAFF RECOMMENDATION WILL STAND.
DOES ANY MEMBER OF THE COUNCIL

[Captioner] 19:04:52
 WISH -- OH, ONE OTHER THING REAL QUICK, I JUST REMEMBERED.
SORRY, WE HAD CLOSED SESSION RIGHT 

[Captioner] 19:04:56
BEFORE THIS AND I WANTED TO TURN IT TO THE CITY ATTORNEY.
IS THERE ANYTHING TO REPORT OUT FROM 

[Captioner] 19:05:01
CLOSED SESSION?
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: THANK YOU, GOOD EVENING MAYOR AND COUNCIL.


[Captioner] 19:05:06
IN CLOSED SESSION THE COUNCIL DISCUSSED TWO CATEGORIES OF

[Captioner] 19:05:10
 ITEM, FIRST WAS ANTICIPATED LITIGATION, ONE CASE, THE COUNCIL TOOK NO REPORTABLE ACTION.


[Captioner] 19:05:15
THE COUNCIL ALSO CONDUCTED ITS BIANNUAL LITIGATION UPDATE

[Captioner] 19:05:19
 PURSUANT TO THE EXISTING LITIGATION PROVISION UNDER GOVERNMENT CODE

[Captioner] 19:05:25
 SECTION 54,956.9, DISCUSSED THE 15 CASES ON THE AGENDA BUT ALSO TOOK NO REPORTABLE

[Captioner] 19:05:27
 ACTION.
THANK YOU, MAYOR.
THAT CONCLUDES MY REPORT.


[Captioner] 19:05:31
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
AND SO AGAIN I RETURN TO THE CONSENT

[Captioner] 19:05:35
 CALENDAR ITEMS, AND CONSENT CALENDAR ITEMS ARE THOSE PASSED

[Captioner] 19:05:39
 WITH ONE COUNCIL VOTE AND THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION WILL STAND.
DOES ANY MEMBER OF THE COUNCIL WISH TO 

[Captioner] 19:05:43
REMOVE AN ITEM FROM THE CONSENT CALENDAR?


[Captioner] 19:05:48
SEEING NONE, IS THERE ANY SPEAKER CARDS FOR AN ITEM ON THE CONSENT CALENDAR FROM

[Captioner] 19:05:52
 THE PUBLIC OR EITHER ON ZOOM?
>> Ms. Gauthier:

[Captioner] 19:05:54
 NO SPEAKERS ON ZOOM.
WE WILL NOT BE HAVING THAT ANY LONGER.


[Captioner] 19:05:59
>> Mayor Mei: OH, THAT'S RIGHT.
>> Ms. Gauthier: AND

[Captioner] 19:06:03
 NO SPEAKERS FOR CONSENT, NO.
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY, THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:06:16
SO AT THIS TIME CAN I GET A MOTION TO MOVE THE CONSENT CALENDAR AS IT STANDS?


[Captioner] 19:06:21
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN AND VICE MAYOR COX?


[Captioner] 19:06:28
>> Vice Mayor Cox: YES, I WAS GOING TO MAKE A MOTION TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THE CONSENT

[Captioner] 19:06:32
 AGENDA FOR ITEMS C THROUGH I ON TONIGHT'S CONSENT AGENDA.


[Captioner] 19:06:37
>> Mayor Mei: SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN.
PLEASE VOTE.


[Captioner] 19:06:48
>> Ms. Gauthier: COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL?
>> Councilmember Campbell: I'M SORRY, 

[Captioner] 19:06:52
I HAD A CLARIFYING QUESTION BEFORE THE VOTE WAS CAST.
>> Mayor Mei: I DIDN'T SEE

[Captioner] 19:06:56
 THAT.
>> Councilmember Campbell: I HEARD COUNCILMEMBER COX SAY CONSENT

[Captioner] 19:07:00
 C THROUGH F, BUT I THOUGHT IT STARTED AT A.
AND

[Captioner] 19:07:04
 MOVED DOWN TO I.


[Captioner] 19:07:09
>> Mayor Mei: THE CONSENT CALENDAR, YES, IT'S CORRECT, THE IT'S ENTIRE CONSENT

[Captioner] 19:07:14
 CALENDAR, SO IT WOULD BE A THROUGH I.
>> Councilmember Campbell: THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: SO WE'LL CLARIFY THAT.


[Captioner] 19:07:17
THANK YOU.
THE WHOLE CONSENT CALENDAR AS IT STANDS.


[Captioner] 19:07:22
PLEASE VOTE.


[Captioner] 19:07:27
AND SO THE CONSENT CALENDAR PASSES UNANIMOUSLY, NOTING THE

[Captioner] 19:07:29
 ONLY -- THE ABSENCE OF COUNCILMEMBER SHAO.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:07:36
AND AT THIS TIME, I ALSO HAVE SEVERAL CEREMONIAL ITEMS.
AND

[Captioner] 19:07:41
 WE HAVE A PROCLAMATION FOR EXTRA MILE DAY BUT THAT'S ALREADY GOING TO BE SENT

[Captioner] 19:07:46
 TO THE --
>> Ms. Gauthier: RIGHT, MADAME MAYOR.
WE LEARNED THAT MS. OTT IS UNABLE

[Captioner] 19:07:50
 TO ATTEND THE MEETING THIS EVENING, SO WE WILL NOT BE READING THAT THIS

[Captioner] 19:07:54
 EVENING, AND WE WILL SEND THE PROCLAMATION TO HER.
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY.


[Captioner] 19:07:58
THANK YOU.
THEN THE OTHER CEREMONIAL ITEM

[Captioner] 19:08:03
 TODAY IS A CHECK PRESENTATION, AND I'D LIKE TO

[Captioner] 19:08:08
 INVITE SENATOR WAHAB TO JOIN ME FOR THE CHECK PRESENTATION.
IS

[Captioner] 19:08:12
 SHE COMING?
OKAY.


[Captioner] 19:08:17
AND I ALSO WOULD LIKE TO INVITE, I BELIEVE THERE'S ALSO

[Captioner] 19:08:22
 BACS CEO JAMIE ALMANZA.


[Captioner] 19:08:26
IS SHE COMING TODAY TOO?


[Captioner] 19:08:32
OKAY, THEN LET ME SEE WHO ELSE.


[Captioner] 19:08:37
ANY MEMBERS OF THE CITY'S I.T. OR HUMAN SERVICES

[Captioner] 19:08:41
 DEPARTMENT.


[Captioner] 19:08:49
I'LL GO DOWN THERE FIRST, WE'LL READ THIS FIRST.


[Captioner] 19:09:21
SO ON BEHALF OF THE FREMONT CITY COUNCIL AND CITY STAFF AND THE FREMONT COMMUNITY, I'D LIKE TO

[Captioner] 19:09:25
 THANK SENATOR WAHAB FOR HER EFFORTS IN HELPING US SECURE $2 MILLION IN FUNDING

[Captioner] 19:09:29
 FOR THE 2023-24 STATE BUDGET FOR THE HOUSING

[Captioner] 19:09:33
 NAVIGATION CENTER, AND THAT'S WHY WE ALSO HAVE THE REPRESENTATION FROM

[Captioner] 19:09:37
 BACS, AND TO EXPAND FREE COMMUNITY WIFI FOR

[Captioner] 19:09:41
 THE FREMONT SIX COMMERCIAL DISTRICTS.
AND SO I

[Captioner] 19:09:45
 BELIEVE THAT THE $500,000 IN PARTICULAR IS

[Captioner] 19:09:50
 OUR SECOND ROUND OF FUNDING WHICH WE'VE UTILIZED IN THE PAST FOR OPERATIONAL FUNDS, WHICH

[Captioner] 19:09:54
 I THINK ARE IMPORTANT FOR OUR CITY'S HOUSING NAVIGATION CENTER, WHICH IS LOCATED

[Captioner] 19:09:58
 RIGHT BEHIND US OVER AT THE CITY HALL.
AND IT'S ALSO IN PARTNERSHIP

[Captioner] 19:10:03
 WITH BAY AREA COMMUNITY SERVICES, AND IT'S A

[Captioner] 19:10:07
 45-BED AND I DON'T KNOW IF WE'RE FULLY OPERATIONAL NOW IN TERMS OF THE

[Captioner] 19:10:11
 FULL CAPACITY?
OH, WONDERFUL, WE'RE BACK UP NOW IN TERMS OF FULL CAPACITY, AND IT

[Captioner] 19:10:16
 OPENED DURING COVID IN 2020, AND HAS SERVED MORE

[Captioner] 19:10:20
 THAN 160 COMMUNITY MEMBERS TO DATE, AND WE'RE REALLY PLEASED TO SHOW THAT FROM THE REPORTS THAT WE'VE

[Captioner] 19:10:24
 HAD OUT OF THAT, THAT IT'S BEEN ABLE TO DELIVER EXCELLENT QUALITY CARE,

[Captioner] 19:10:28
 AND THE RESIDENTS OF THE AGENCY RECEIVE WRAP-AROUND SERVICES

[Captioner] 19:10:33
 INCLUDING HEALTH AND WELLNESS, EMPLOYEE ASSISTANCE, SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND COUNSELING, AND I

[Captioner] 19:10:37
 THINK WE HAVE A 68% PLACEMENT RATE, THE TWO-YEAR REPORT.


[Captioner] 19:10:43
IS IT 60%?


[Captioner] 19:10:48
OKAY.
AND WE ALSO WANT TO NOTE THAT WE PLACED 60% OF THE PEOPLE

[Captioner] 19:10:52
 SO FAR IN HOUSING.
THE SECOND PIECE OF IT IS FOR THE COMMERCIAL DISTRICT

[Captioner] 19:10:56
 WIFI PROJECT, WHICH IS FOR ACCESS FREMONT, AND WE

[Captioner] 19:11:00
 HAD A PRESENTATION ALSO FROM OUR ASSEMBLYMEMBER, AND IT'S

[Captioner] 19:11:06
 FOR $1.5 MILLION, WHICH WAS SECURED IN THE STATE BUDGET FOR THE CITY OF FREMONT'S COMMERCIAL DISTRICT

[Captioner] 19:11:11
 WIFI ACCESS EXPANSION PROJECT KNOWN AS ACCESS FREMONT,

[Captioner] 19:11:16
 AND

[Captioner] 19:11:20
 IT'S -- THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR

[Captioner] 19:11:24
 US, DURING THE PANDEMIC WE'VE HAD MANY STUDENTS AND FAMILIES WHO NEED ACCESS AND WE WANT TO

[Captioner] 19:11:29
 HAVE EQUITY IN DELIVERY OF THAT.
SO THESE DISTRICTS

[Captioner] 19:11:33
 COMPRISE OF CENTERVILLE, IRVINGTON, MILES, MISSION SAN JOSÉ, WARM SPRINGS AND OUR

[Captioner] 19:11:37
 DOWNTOWN CITY CENTER.
SO IN 2022, THE CITY

[Captioner] 19:11:41
 RECEIVED $1.5 MILLION IN FEDERAL FUNDING WHICH WAS HALF THE PROJECTED COST FOR THIS, AND

[Captioner] 19:11:46
 THIS STATE FUNDING ALLOCATION WILL ALLOW THE CITY TO BUILD OUT OUR

[Captioner] 19:11:50
 WIFI PROJECT TO SERVE A LARGER AREA OF EACH DISTRICT AND

[Captioner] 19:11:55
 TO INCLUDE PLAZAS AND GATHERING SPACES WHICH ARE SO IMPORTANT FOR OUR COMMUNITY WHICH WILL HAVE A GREATER

[Captioner] 19:11:59
 IMPACT ON RESIDENTS AND SMALL BUSINESSES INCLUDING THOSE WHO COME TO

[Captioner] 19:12:03
 FREMONT FOR EVENTS LIKE WEEKLY FARMERS' MARKETS, FOOD, TRUCK EVENTS AND

[Captioner] 19:12:07
 OUR FESTIVAL OF ARTS.
SO ON BEHALF OF THE CITY COUNCIL, WE JUST WANT TO SHARE THAT WE ARE VERY

[Captioner] 19:12:13
 GRATEFUL FOR OUR EFFORTS TO HELP OUR COMMUNITY.
SO I'D LIKE TO INVITE SENATOR WAHAB TO 

[Captioner] 19:12:17
SAY A FEW WORDS AND AFTERWARDS I'LL INVITE THE COUNCIL DOWN TO TAKE A PHOTO.


[Captioner] 19:12:21
>> THANK YOU.
THANK YOU, MAYOR MEI.
I DO JUST WANT TO SAY THAT I'M VERY

[Captioner] 19:12:25
 PROUD TO BE ABLE TO SERVE THIS CITY.
I GREW UP IN

[Captioner] 19:12:29
 THE CITY AND IT'S VERY INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TO GIVE BACK AND, YOU KNOW,

[Captioner] 19:12:34
 GRANTED WE ARE FACING MORE TOUGHER ECONOMIC TIMES.
IT'S

[Captioner] 19:12:38
 INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT OUR HOMELESS POPULATION IS A GROWING

[Captioner] 19:12:42
 POPULATION.
AND I OFTEN STATE THAT WITH OUR HOMELESS POPULATION, THE

[Captioner] 19:12:46
 FASTEST DEMOGRAPHIC WITHIN THAT HOMELESS POPULATION

[Captioner] 19:12:51
 IS OUR SENIOR COMMUNITY.
THOSE ARE OUR GRANDPARENT AND MUCH

[Captioner] 19:12:56
 MORE, AND AT THE SAME TIME, WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO

[Captioner] 19:13:01
 SECURE $500,000, HALF A MILLION DOLLARS TO THE NAVIGATION CENTER THAT

[Captioner] 19:13:05
 FREMONT HAS ESTABLISHED AT THE 2,022-POINT IN TIME

[Captioner] 19:13:10
 COUNT, FREMONT'S HOMELESS POPULATION GREW BY NEARLY 69% IN THREE YEARS.


[Captioner] 19:13:14
NO DOUBT IN LARGE PART DUE TO THE PANDEMIC AND MUCH MORE, AND

[Captioner] 19:13:18
 NAVIGATION CENTERS ARE A PROVEN MODEL FOR MOVING PEOPLE OFF OF THE

[Captioner] 19:13:22
 STREETS AND EVENTUALLY INTO MORE PERMANENT HOUSING.
NOT JUST HOUSING BUT

[Captioner] 19:13:27
 ALSO SUPPORTIVE SERVICES THAT SUPPORT THE WHOLE INDIVIDUAL,

[Captioner] 19:13:31
 WRAP-AROUND SERVICES AND MUCH MORE, AND THAT'S THROUGH THE PARTNERSHIP WITH THE BAY AREA COMMUNITY

[Captioner] 19:13:36
 SERVICES, WHICH I'M VERY HAPPY TO SEE.
I'M GLAD TO SEE THAT FREMONT IS ALSO

[Captioner] 19:13:40
 INVESTING IN PROGRAMS AND MODELS THAT WE KNOW WORK.
AND AT THE SAME TIME,

[Captioner] 19:13:44
 I WOULD LIKE TO ALSO JUST ACKNOWLEDGE THE FACT THAT WE WERE ALSO ABLE

[Captioner] 19:13:48
 TO SECURE $1.5 MILLION FOR THE WIFI ACCESS

[Captioner] 19:13:53
 EXPANSION PROJECT.
DIGITAL LITERACY IS A KEY TO SUCCESS AND A TOOL

[Captioner] 19:13:57
 FOR SELF EMPOWERMENT, AND WE SEE THE GROWING DIGITAL DIVIDE AND HERE

[Captioner] 19:14:01
 EVEN IN THE SILICON VALLEY, WE STILL SEE HUGE GAPS, AND THE FACT

[Captioner] 19:14:05
 THAT FREMONT IS MOVING FORWARD IS VERY BENEFICIAL

[Captioner] 19:14:09
 TO THE LARGER COMMUNITY, AND WE NEED THE INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS TO

[Captioner] 19:14:13
 SUPPORT ACCESS.
PANDEMIC HIGHLIGHTED THE ISSUES FOR K THROUGH 12

[Captioner] 19:14:18
 STUDENTS, REGARDLESS OF WHAT CITY YOU BELONGED INTO, WE SAW THAT

[Captioner] 19:14:22
 PEOPLE DID NOT HAVE ACCESS TO CHROMEBOOKS, TO WIFI, TO HOT SPOTS, TO YOU NAME IT.


[Captioner] 19:14:26
AND IT'S ALSO AN ISSUE FOR AGING ADULTS ATTEMPTING TO ACCESS

[Captioner] 19:14:31
 SAFETY NETS AND THE BENEFIT AROUND IT.
EVEN THE COVID SHOTS, YOU HAD TO SIGN

[Captioner] 19:14:35
 UP ONLINE.
SO I'M PROUD TO SUPPORT THIS

[Captioner] 19:14:39
 EVIDENT THAT BRIDGES GAPS IN THE DIGITAL DIVIDE.
I WELCOME ALL OF THE COUNCILMEMBERS TO 

[Captioner] 19:14:43
TAKE A PHOTO AND I'M VERY PROUD TO PARTNER WITH THE CITY OF FREMONT.
THANK YOU TO

[Captioner] 19:14:47
 THE STAFF.
WE REALLY COULDN'T DO IT WITHOUT YOU GUYS AND FOR THAT VISION AND WE REALLY 

[Captioner] 19:14:52
APPRECIATE THAT, AND I JUST REALLY WANT TO THANK THE COMMUNITY MEMBERS ALSO FOR JUST

[Captioner] 19:14:54
 TRUSTING THE MOVEMENT THAT WE'RE TRYING TO START.
SO THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:15:03
>> Mayor Mei: WHY DON'T WE INVITE THE COUNCILMEMBERS TO COME DOWN AND TAKE A PHOTO.


[Captioner] 19:15:08
WOULD YOU LIKE TO SHARE?
>> I JUST WANT TO

[Captioner] 19:15:12
 SAY THANK YOU TO THE BOARD AND TO THE SUPERVISORS WHO ARE HERE

[Captioner] 19:15:17
 THIS EVENING, AND WE REALLY COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT WITHOUT THE CITY OF FREMONT'S HELP.


[Captioner] 19:15:22
IT'S BEEN A GREAT WORK-AROUND AND A GREAT WORKABILITY THAT WE'VE HAD

[Captioner] 19:15:26
 WITH THEM TO MAKE THIS WORK AND BE SUCCESSFUL.


[Captioner] 19:15:30
>> Mayor Mei: NO, THANK YOU.
IT CERTAINLY TOOK A LOT OF SUPPORT FROM

[Captioner] 19:15:34
 THE COMMUNITY AND THE COUNCIL TO BE ABLE TO MOVE THE AGENCY FORWARD.


[Captioner] 19:17:54
>> Mayor Mei: SO THANK YOU FOR ALL WHO HAVE JOINED US THIS EVENING.
I ALSO AT THIS TIME AM GOING

[Captioner] 19:17:58
 TO THEN OPEN US UP TO PUBLIC COMMENTS.

HONORED COUNCILMEMBERS, CITY STAFF, EXECUTIVES, AND

[Captioner] 19:19:14
 ART LOVERS EVERYWHERE IN FREMONT!
I WANT

[Captioner] 19:19:18
 TO TELL YOU THAT ART IS A -- IT CAN CAPTURE AN

[Captioner] 19:19:22
 HISTORICAL MOMENT.
MAYBE A

[Captioner] 19:19:27
 SOCIAL ISSUE.
MAYBE A PORTRAIT OR A LANDSCAPE.


[Captioner] 19:19:32
BUT ART IS ALSO A HEALING THING.


[Captioner] 19:19:36
THOSE THAT CREATE ART ARE OFTEN HEALING THEMSELVES.


[Captioner] 19:19:41
MY NAME IS KATE, AND TONIGHT I'M

[Captioner] 19:19:46
 REPRESENTING THE OLIVE HEIGHT ART GUILD.
AND I'D LIKE TO INVITE

IT'S A BIG

[Captioner] 19:19:53
 EVENT, IF YOU HAVEN'T HAD A REALLY FUN DATE OR NIGHT OUT, THIS WOULD BE THE ONE.

[Captioner] 19:21:14
 MACK.
>> WELCOME,

[Captioner] 19:21:18
 MR. HINDS.
>> Ms. Gauthier: BRIDGET MACK FOLLOWED BY SHARON.


[Captioner] 19:21:32
>> Mayor Mei: WELCOME, BRIDGET.
>> HELLO, MADAME

[Captioner] 19:21:36
 MAYOR AND COUNCILMEMBERS.
I WANTED TO SPEAK ABOUT MY CONCERNS REGARDING

[Captioner] 19:21:40
 THE FREMONT TRI-CITY ANIMAL SHELTER.
I HAD TO HAVE CONTACT WITH THEM

[Captioner] 19:21:44
 RECENTLY REGARDING AN ANIMAL THAT I FOUND.
I'VE NOT BEEN ABLE

[Captioner] 19:21:49
 TO GET AHOLD OF ANYBODY AT THE SHELTER WHEN I CALLED FOR ANIMAL OFFICER

[Captioner] 19:21:53
 ASSISTANCE, THEY SAID THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANYONE AND THAT I WOULD HAVE TO CAPTURE THE ANIMAL MYSELF AND TAKE

[Captioner] 19:21:58
 TO BEACON ANIMAL HOSPITAL, WHICH I DID.
SINCE

[Captioner] 19:22:02
 THEN I'VE BEEN TRYING TO REACH SOMEBODY AT THE ANIMAL SHELTER BUT NO MATTER WHEN YOU

[Captioner] 19:22:06
 CALL, NOBODY ANSWERS THE PHONE.
AND I'VE

[Captioner] 19:22:10
 KIND OF DONE A DEEPER DIVE INTO THE ISSUES THERE AND THEY'RE VERY

[Captioner] 19:22:15
 UNDERSTAFFED.
THEY'VE BEEN TRYING TO HIRE STAFF IN.
I LOOKED AT THE

[Captioner] 19:22:19
 ANIMAL ASSISTANCE, THE POLICE ASSISTANCE THAT WILL HELP IN THE

[Captioner] 19:22:23
 PROGRAM AND THEY'RE PAYING THEM HORRIBLY SMALL SALARY.


[Captioner] 19:22:27
IF SOMEBODY WOULD WORK FULL TIME AT $16 AN HOUR, NO BENEFITS ARE

[Captioner] 19:22:32
, THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE $32,000 A

[Captioner] 19:22:36
 YEAR.
TO WORK THERE OR EEN VOLUNTEER, YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH POLICE VETTING

[Captioner] 19:22:40
 INCLUDING GOING THROUGH LIE DETECTOR TESTS AND SECURITY CLEARANCES SO PEOPLE THAT DO WANT TO HELP

[Captioner] 19:22:44
 ARE NOT ABLE TO VOLUNTEER BECAUSE THE PROCESS IS VERY DIFFICULT.


[Captioner] 19:22:49
SO I FEEL LIKE A CITY OF FREMONT THAT HAS THE WEALTH

[Captioner] 19:22:53
 THAT WE HAVE, WE SHOULD HAVE A WORLD CLASS ANIMAL SHELTER AND

[Captioner] 19:22:57
 NOT ONE THAT THE PUBLIC CAN'T EVEN ACCESS.
AS A PUBLIC CITIZEN, I CAN'T GO TO THE 

[Captioner] 19:23:01
ANIMAL SHELTER.
THE SHELTER IS CLOSED TO THE PUBLIC.


[Captioner] 19:23:05
WHEN I COULDN'T REACH ANYBODY BY PHONE I DROVE TO THE

[Captioner] 19:23:09
 SHELTER, THE LOBBY WAS CLOSED AND THERE WAS NO WAY TO GAIN ENTRANCE.
SO I WOULD APPEAL TO YOU

[Captioner] 19:23:13
 TO FIND WAYS TO BETTER FUND THE SHELTER, TO GIVE THE PUBLIC

[Captioner] 19:23:18
 ACCESS BACK TO THE SHELTER, AND TO TAKE CARE OF THE ANIMALS HERE

[Captioner] 19:23:22
 IN FREMONT IN A BETTER MANNER THAN WHAT THEY'RE BEING CARED FOR.


[Captioner] 19:23:27
AND THE LAST COUPLE ANIMALS I HAVE ADOPTED THROUGH THE HUMANE SOCIETY

[Captioner] 19:23:31
 OF SILICON VALLEY IN MILIPITAS, AND THEY HAVE LIKE A WORLD CLASS SHELTER THERE, AND FREMONT

[Captioner] 19:23:35
 SHOULD TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT THEY HAVE AVAILABLE AND TRY TO EMULATE THAT.


[Captioner] 19:23:40
SO THOSE ARE MY CONCERNS.
AS A CONCERNED CITIZEN OF LIVING HERE IN FREMONT

[Captioner] 19:23:44
 FOR 30 YEARS.
THANK YOU.
>> Ms. Gauthier: THANK

[Captioner] 19:23:49
 YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
I KNOW YOU SENT AN EMAIL

[Captioner] 19:23:54
 TO SOME OF US TOO, SO THANK YOU.
>> Ms. Gauthier: THE NEXT SPEAKER

[Captioner] 19:23:58
 IS SHARON GIOHONINI.


[Captioner] 19:24:07
>> Mayor Mei: WELCOME, SHARON.


[Captioner] 19:24:12
>> I HAVE BEEN A RESIDENT OF FREMONT SINCE 1973.


[Captioner] 19:24:17
AND I'M CURRENTLY A MEMBER, HAVE BEEN FOR SOME TIME, OF THE

[Captioner] 19:24:21
 OHLONE HUMANE SOCIETY FOR THE LAST THREE MONTHS, I'VE BEEN ON THE INFORMATION

[Captioner] 19:24:25
 LINE.
AND THE PROBLEM

[Captioner] 19:24:29
 WITH COMMUNITY OR FERAL CATS

[Captioner] 19:24:33
 IS EXTREME.
IF ANYONE IS READING THEIR NEXTDOOR,

[Captioner] 19:24:38
 THINK EVERYBODY NEIGHBORHOOD IN FREMONT, UNION CITY AND NEWARK IS EXPERIENCING

[Captioner] 19:24:42
 THIS HEAVY INCREASE IN COMMUNITY STRAY

[Captioner] 19:24:47
 CATS.
AND SO YOU MAY THINK THAT IT IS JUST AN ANIMAL

[Captioner] 19:24:51
 PROBLEM, BUT THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE CALLING ME ON THE INFORMATION LINE.
AND

[Captioner] 19:24:55
 THEY'RE UPSET.
SOME OF THEM ARE CRYING, SOME OF THEM ARE YELLING, AND THEY'RE SAYING 

[Captioner] 19:24:59
THEY'RE NOT GETTING HELP.
AND THEY'RE SO GLAD

[Captioner] 19:25:03
 THAT SOMEONE PICKS UP THE PHONE AT THE HUMANE SOCIETY THAT THEY'RE ALWAYS SO PLEASANT TO

[Captioner] 19:25:07
 ME.
BUT IT IS A REAL

[Captioner] 19:25:12
 PROBLEM, AND TRYING TO FIND SPAY AND NEUTER SERVICES

[Captioner] 19:25:16
 FOR THEM, AND PEOPLE ARE WILLING IN THE COMMUNITY TO PAY

[Captioner] 19:25:20
 THIS

[Captioner] 19:25:27
 LOW CO-PAY, EVEN THOUGH THE COMMUNITY CATS ARE NOT THEIRS,

[Captioner] 19:25:31
 THEY'RE OFTEN WILLING TO PAY, BUT WE HAVE RECENTLY SHUT DOWN OUR

[Captioner] 19:25:35
 LOW COST VOUCHER PROGRAM BECAUSE WE'VE GONE THROUGH OUR BUDGET.
AND

[Captioner] 19:25:39
 I WONDER IF THIS IS THE BEST FREMONT CAN DO FOR ITS

[Captioner] 19:25:43
 CITIZENS.
THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:25:47
NEXT SPEAKER, PLEASE.
>> Ms. Gauthier:

[Captioner] 19:25:52
 CHRISTINA MARTINEZ, FOLLOWED BY FABIAN MEYER.


[Captioner] 19:26:04
>> GOOD EVENING, COUNCILMEMBER, STAFF AND MAYOR.
MY NAME IS

[Captioner] 19:26:08
 CHRISTINA MARTINEZ.
I'VE BEEN VOLUNTEERING FOR THE OHLONE HUMANE SOCIETY FOR THE LAST

[Captioner] 19:26:12
 YEAR AND A HALF.
YOU WON'T BELIEVE THE NUMBER OF HOURS

[Captioner] 19:26:16
 WE HAVE -- I HAVE SPENT DOING THE

[Captioner] 19:26:21
 TNR PART OF THE PROGRAM, DRIVING TO RICHMOND, DRIVING TO

[Captioner] 19:26:26
 PLEASANTON, DRIVING TO SAN FRANCISCO, I DON'T DO THAT, SOMEBODY ELSE DOES THAT,

[Captioner] 19:26:30
 DRIVING TO REDWOOD CITY, HERE IN

[Captioner] 19:26:34
 FREMONT, FOUR PAWS, ALL OVER THE BAY AREA, TRYING TO FIND A

[Captioner] 19:26:38
 PLACE WHERE WE CAN NEUTER AND SPAY THE FERAL CATS THAT ARE FOUND IN FREMONT.


[Captioner] 19:26:43
WHEN I LOOK AT THE WEBSITE IN FREMONT, I

[Captioner] 19:26:48
 SEE A LINE THAT SAYS "HOW CAN I HELP?


[Captioner] 19:26:52
PLEASE FILL OUT THIS COMMUNITY QUESTIONNAIRE THAT ASKS

[Captioner] 19:26:56
 IF THE PERSON IS ABLE TO TRAP AND TRANSPORT TO THE SHELTER.
MANY RESIDENTS

[Captioner] 19:27:01
 OF FREMONT FILL OUT THIS QUESTIONNAIRE WITH NO RESPONSE FROM THE SHELTER.


[Captioner] 19:27:06
IT'S ABSOLUTELY BEYOND BELIEF THAT WE HAVE A SHELTER THAT DOES NOT COMMUNICATE WITH

[Captioner] 19:27:12
 THE COMMUNITY.
YOU'RE ALSO MISLEADING THE PUBLIC.
YOU'RE BASICALLY SAYING THAT WE'RE

[Captioner] 19:27:16
 DOING SPAY AND NEUTER WHEN YOU'RE NOT.
THAT WEBSITE NEEDS TO BE UPDATED.


[Captioner] 19:27:23
IN TERMS OF LIKE SHARON SAID, SHOWING UP AT THE

[Captioner] 19:27:27
 SHELTER, IT FEELS VERY HOSTILE.
IT FEELS THAT YOU ARE NOT WELCOME.


[Captioner] 19:27:32
AND WHEN YOU'RE PART OF THE CITY, THE CITY SHOULD BE WELCOMING ITS

[Captioner] 19:27:36
 RESIDENTS.
THE DAYS OF CLOSING DOORS ON PEOPLE ARE OVER, AND WE SHOULD BE

[Captioner] 19:27:40
 ALLOWED TO GO INSIDE AND HAVE A WORD WITH THE SHELTER.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:27:45
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
NEXT SPEAKER?
AND PLEAS NOTE THE COMMENTS THAT ARE 

[Captioner] 19:27:50
BEING MADE WILL BE SHARED WITH OUR STAFF AND TEAM.


[Captioner] 19:27:56
>> Ms. Gauthier: NEXT SPEAKER IS FABIAN MEYER, FOLLOWED BY KELLY ABREU.


[Captioner] 19:28:03
>> HELLO, GOOD EVENING.
I'M HERE TODAY BECAUSE I WANT TO RAISE

[Captioner] 19:28:06
 AWARENESS TO A TOPIC THAT WAS EASY TO IGNORE UNTIL IT GREW OUT OF PROPORTION.


[Captioner] 19:28:11
I'M TALKING ABOUT THE FERAL AND STRAY CAT POPULATION IN THE TRI-CITY

[Captioner] 19:28:15
 AREA.
I CONSIDER MYSELF AN ANIMAL ADVOCATE AND I GOT

[Captioner] 19:28:18
 INVOLVED WITH RESCUING CATS WHEN WE FOUND 25 KITTENS IN SOMEONE'S BACKYARD.


[Captioner] 19:28:22
THIS IS WHEN I JOINED THE OHLONE HUMANE SOCIETY AND I'M NOW PART OF A GROUP THAT

[Captioner] 19:28:27
 PROVIDES A SERVICE TO THE CITY CALLED TRAP, NEUTER AND RETURN, IN

[Captioner] 19:28:31
 SHORT, TNR.
WE MAINLY TRAP FERAL AND STRAY

[Captioner] 19:28:35
 CATS, SPAY AND NEUTER THEM BY A VETERINARIAN AND RETURN THEM TO THE ORIGINAL LOCATION.


[Captioner] 19:28:39
WE RUN A FOSTER PROGRAM FOR KITTENS THAT WOULD OTHERWISE DIE ON THE STREET OR CONTRIBUTE TO

[Captioner] 19:28:43
 THE PROBLEM OF CAT COLONIES WITH 100 AND MORE

[Captioner] 19:28:46
 CATS ACROSS FREMONT.
FREMONT IS CONSIDERED ONE OF THE BEST PLACES TO LIVE IN THE BAY AREA.


[Captioner] 19:28:51
IT IS ALSO KNOWN, WELL, FOR HUMANS, IT IS ALSO

[Captioner] 19:28:55
 KNOWN, DO YOU KNOW WHAT FREMONT IS ALSO KNOWN FOR?
SUPPLYING

[Captioner] 19:28:59
 THE ENTIRE BAY AREA WITH RESCUE KITTENS.
I HELP A LOT OF

[Captioner] 19:29:04
 CITIZENS WITH INJURED CATS AND KITTENS THAT NEED TO GET RESCUED.
I LOVE

[Captioner] 19:29:08
 ANIMALS AND IT SADDENS ME, HOW MANY SUFFER IN THIS CITY.
HAVING

[Captioner] 19:29:12
 BATTLED THIS PROBLEM IN FREMONT FOR OVER THREE YEARS NOW I'VE NOTICED IT IS GETTING WORSE

[Captioner] 19:29:16
 SINCE THE SHELTER SHUT DOWN DURING THE PANDEMIC AND DIDN'T RE-OPEN.


[Captioner] 19:29:21
THE NUMBER OF REQUESTS OF

[Captioner] 19:29:25
 FOSTER CATS, INJURED KIT TENS HAVE ALSO INCREASED.
WHAT HAS ALSO

[Captioner] 19:29:29
 INCREASED ARE DISEASES WE CAN ALSO SPREAD TO HUMANS.
THE PUBLIC IS OUTRAGED BECAUSE THEY 

[Captioner] 19:29:32
WANT TO HELP BUT IT IS TOO DIFFICULT AND EXPENSIVE TO DO THE RIGHT THING IN OUR CITY.


[Captioner] 19:29:37
THIS IS A PRINTOUT OF A NEXTDOOR THREAD ABOUT THE TRI-CITY SHELTER

[Captioner] 19:29:41
 THAT SKYROCKETED TO OVER 20 PAGES WITHIN HOURS AND GOT MANY REACTIONS FROM CONCERNED

[Captioner] 19:29:45
 CITIZENS.
OTHER CITIES SHOW

[Captioner] 19:29:49
 HOW TO RUN AN EFFECTIVE SHELTER BY PROVIDING TRANSPARENCY, ATTRACTIVE SALARIES

[Captioner] 19:29:54
 AND ALLOWING DONATIONS, ADOPTION EVENTS AND SO ON.
WE CAN DO BETTER

[Captioner] 19:29:58
 AND I'M HERE BECAUSE I WANT TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION.


[Captioner] 19:30:02
>> Ms. Gauthier: THE NEXT SPEAKER IS KELLY ABREU.


[Captioner] 19:30:07
FOLLOWED BY RAJ NANDU.


[Captioner] 19:30:16
>> FIRST I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT THE INCONSISTENCY AND ILL LOGIC IN CUTTING OFF

[Captioner] 19:30:20
 ZOOM.
YOU KNOW, YOU JUST HAD A MEETING AN HOUR AND A HALF AGO

[Captioner] 19:30:25
 AT 5:30 P.M., AND YOU DECIDED YOU WOULD ACCEPT ZOOM.
CLOSED

[Captioner] 19:30:29
 SESSION.
SAID RIGHT THERE ON YOUR AGENDA.
CALL US AT THIS NUMBER

[Captioner] 19:30:33
 FOR ZOOM.
SO WHAT IS THIS?
YOU'RE GOING TO SELECTIVELY PICK WHICH 

[Captioner] 19:30:37
MEETINGS YOU WANT TO ACCEPT ZOOM ON?
AND YOU ALREADY HAD, REMEMBER, AS OF LAST

[Captioner] 19:30:41
 WEEK AND FOR THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS, YOU HAD SOMETHING ABOUT

[Captioner] 19:30:45
 DISRUPTIVE BEHAVIOR WILL NOT BE TOLERATED, BLAH BLAH PLA, AND I'M SURE YOU HAVE METHODS

[Captioner] 19:30:49
 OF DELAYING ZOOM CALLS BY A FEW SECONDS AND YOU HAVE METHODS OF CUTTING THEM OFF,

[Captioner] 19:30:54
 SO THIS IDEA OF CUTTING OFF ZOOM

[Captioner] 19:30:58
 PREEMPTIVELY PRECAUTIONARY, AND HOW MANY DISRUPTIVE ZOOM

[Captioner] 19:31:02
 CALLERS HAVE YOU HAD?
I THINK IT'S A GRAND TOTAL

[Captioner] 19:31:07
 OF ZERO?
ZERO.
SO THIS -- YOU

[Captioner] 19:31:11
 KNOW, IT'S A PREEMPTIVE ASSAULT ON FREE SPEECH IS WHAT IT IS.


[Captioner] 19:31:15
AND THEN AT MISSION PEAK, WE DO HAVE GOOD

[Captioner] 19:31:20
 NEWS.
PEOPLE HERE WERE WHISPERING, MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T BE OUT THERE REPAIRING

[Captioner] 19:31:24
 THE POLE.
MAYBE THAT POLE JUST GOT CUT OFF BY ITSELF.


[Captioner] 19:31:31
DAMAGED.
BUT WHEN IT WAS REPAIRED, JUST

[Captioner] 19:31:37
 RECENTLY, 1,000 LIKES ON FACEBOOK WHICH I'M TOLD IS A

[Captioner] 19:31:41
 VERY -- 1300 LIKES ON FACEBOOK, WHICH IS A

[Captioner] 19:31:46
 VERY, VERY INTENSE ENGAGEMENT, AND ONE-THIRD OF THOSE PEOPLE WERE FORWARDING THOSE

[Captioner] 19:31:49
 MESSAGES TO THEIR FRIENDS ON FACEBOOK.
A LOT OF FORWARDING GOING ON.


[Captioner] 19:31:56
THE BAY AREA COMMUNITY IS ECSTATIC OVER THE PROTECTION AND

[Captioner] 19:31:59
 PRESERVATION AND RESTORATION OF THE MISSION PEAK POLE.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:32:11
>> Ms. Gauthier: RAJ NANDU FOLLOWED BY DANIEL

[Captioner] 19:32:16
 CARPELOVICH.
>> THANK YOU.
I'M SPECIFICALLY HERE TO THANK STATE

[Captioner] 19:32:21
 OF CALIFORNIA, SPECIFICALLY GOVERNOR NEWSOM AND ALSO

[Captioner] 19:32:25
 SPECIFICALLY THE CITY COUNCIL, FREMONT CITY COUNCIL FOR

[Captioner] 19:32:31
 OPPOSING THE POINTLESS

[Captioner] 19:32:37
 UNCONSTITUTIONAL SB -- BILL, AS YOU KNOW, GAVIN NEWSOM HAS VETOED

[Captioner] 19:32:41
 THE BILL SATURDAY, AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THE SUPPORT SO FAR WE GOT

[Captioner] 19:32:45
 FROM CITY OF FREMONT.
I ALSO WOULD LIKE TO REQUEST THE CITY, CITY

[Captioner] 19:32:49
 CAN PASS A RESOLUTION, NOT THAT

[Captioner] 19:32:52
 UPSETS BILLS IN THE FUTURE IN ANY OTHER FORM OR SHAPE.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:33:04
>> Ms. Gauthier: DANIEL CARPELOVICH FOLLOWED BY

[Captioner] 19:33:09
 HILLARY.


[Captioner] 19:33:14
>> HI.
GOOD EVENING.
IS THIS THING ON?


[Captioner] 19:33:20
>> Mayor Mei: YES.
>> MY FIRST COMMENT, I JUST WANTED TO COMMENT ON

[Captioner] 19:33:24
 THE ZOOM COMMENTS THING.
I PERSONALLY THINK IT'S A GOOD

[Captioner] 19:33:29
 IDEA TO KEEP IT JUST IN PERSON ONLY.
I THINK IT IMPROVES THE

[Captioner] 19:33:33
 QUALITY OF THE RESPONSES, IT PUTS A FACE TO A NAME, IT

[Captioner] 19:33:38
 KIND OF MAYBE ACTS AS A BIT OF A BARRIER TO ENTRY IF YOU CARE ABOUT AN ISSUE ENOUGH

[Captioner] 19:33:42
 TO GET OUT OF YOUR -- OFF YOUR COUCH AND GO TO THE MEETING AND TALK ABOUT IT.


[Captioner] 19:33:46
I THINK THAT'S A GOOD THING.
YOU KNOW, THERE ARE OBVIOUSLY ACCESSIBILITY

[Captioner] 19:33:50
 CONCERNS BUT I THINK LEAVING THE EMAIL OPTION OPEN

[Captioner] 19:33:55
 IS A GOOD IDEA FOR THAT.
BUT I ALSO WANT TO

[Captioner] 19:33:59
 TALK ABOUT A DIFFERENT TOPIC.
I'VE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO ON

[Captioner] 19:34:03
 A FEW COMMUNITY BIKE RIDES WITH CITY STAFF, AND I WAS HAPPY TO SEE A

[Captioner] 19:34:07
 FEW OF THE COUNCILMEMBERS THERE AS WELL, AS WELL AS THE MAYOR.


[Captioner] 19:34:12
AND ONE THING I LEARNED BASICALLY FROM THOSE

[Captioner] 19:34:16
 EXPERIENCES IS FOR ALL OF THE GREAT PLANNING, ALL THE GREAT

[Captioner] 19:34:20
 PLANS THAT WE HAVE, WE HAVE SO MANY PROJECTS

[Captioner] 19:34:24
 THAT ARE JUST

[Captioner] 19:34:28
 WAITING ON FUNDING.
PLACES WE'VE DONE THE ENGINEERING, THE

[Captioner] 19:34:33
 DESIGN, SOMETIMES EVEN THE ENVIRONMENTAL CLEARANCES, AND WE'RE JUST

[Captioner] 19:34:37
 WAITING ON FUNDING.
WE CAN MAKE ALL THESE GREAT

[Captioner] 19:34:41
 PLANS, WE CAN VOTE ON THEM, WE CAN PASS THEM, WE

[Captioner] 19:34:45
 CAN TALK ABOUT HOW GREAT OF A JOB WE DID ON PASSING THOSE PLANS AND RUNNING

[Captioner] 19:34:49
 THEM UP AND THEY'RE GREAT PLANS, BUT IT DOESN'T REALLY COUNT FOR MUCH

[Captioner] 19:34:54
 IF WE DON'T ACTUALLY PUT OUR MONEY WHERE OUR MOUTH IS AND ACTUALLY FUND THOSE PROJECTS

[Captioner] 19:34:57
 AND FUND THEM QUICKLY AND FUND THEM FULLY FROM THE START.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:35:05
>> Ms. Gauthier: THE NEXT SPEAKER IS HILLARY FOLLOWED BY DOTTIE.


[Captioner] 19:35:14
>> GOOD EVENING.
THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING US TO SPEAK.
I'M HERE AS

[Captioner] 19:35:19
 A REPRESENTATIVE OF OHLONE HUMANE SOCIETY.
MY WHOLE EFFORT IS

[Captioner] 19:35:23
 TO SEE THE CATS AND FOR THE LOW INCOME

[Captioner] 19:35:28
 RESIDENTS IN FREMONT, CATS, DOGS AND BUNNIES GET SPAYED AND NEUTERED.
MY

[Captioner] 19:35:33
 UNPAID JOB AS DIRECTOR OF SPAY AND NEUTER FOR OHLONE HUMANE SOCIETY.


[Captioner] 19:35:37
I WANTED TO ADDRESS THE CITY COUNCIL AND MAYOR TONIGHT BECAUSE WE'RE VERY CONCERNED.


[Captioner] 19:35:41
WE DO HAVE A LOW INCOME SUBSIDIZED SPAY AND

[Captioner] 19:35:46
 NEUTER PROGRAM AS WELL AS THE TNR PROGRAM FOR THE FERAL CATS AND WE'VE RUN OUT

[Captioner] 19:35:50
 OF MONEY.
WHAT DO WE DO AT THIS POINT?
WE HAVE HELPED -- WE HAVE SPENT

[Captioner] 19:35:56
 OVER $52,000 AS OF SEPTEMBER SPAYING AND NEUTERING,

[Captioner] 19:36:00
 VACCINATING AND TREATING FOR PARASITES, BUT WE HAVE NO MORE MONEY.


[Captioner] 19:36:06
WHAT IS THE PUBLIC GOING TO DO?
THE LOW INCOME RESIDENTS HAVE DEPENDED ON US FOR

[Captioner] 19:36:11
 ASSISTANCE, THE TNR CATS WHO HAVE NO ONE TO SPEAK FOR THEM ARE DEPENDING ON US AND

[Captioner] 19:36:15
 OUR K KITTEN PROGRAM.
WE

[Captioner] 19:36:18
 NEED MORE ASSISTANCE FROM THE SHELTER.
WE REALLY HAD A GOOD PROGRAM GOING 

[Captioner] 19:36:22
THERE FOR A WHILE WHERE WE COULD BRING IN CATS FROM

[Captioner] 19:36:27
 THE COMMUNITY, GET THEM SPAYED AND NEUTERED, AND THAT WAS EVEN

[Captioner] 19:36:32
 DURING COVID, AND THEN THAT STOPPED.
SO I IMPLORE YOU, WE

[Captioner] 19:36:36
 NEED TO FIND A WAY TO FUND A VETERINARIAN AT OUR SHELTER

[Captioner] 19:36:40
 TO SUPPORT SERVICES THAT THE RESIDENTS OF FREMONT ARE PAYING FOR.


[Captioner] 19:36:47
THIS IS NOT SOMETHING INORDINATE.
WE CAN DO THIS.
SO WE

[Captioner] 19:36:51
 NEED EVERYONE'S SUPPORT AND WE WILL BE BACK TO CITY COUNCIL MEETINGS IF NEED

[Captioner] 19:36:55
 BE, WE'LL START A PETITION TO TALK ABOUT WHAT

[Captioner] 19:36:58
 NEEDS TO BE DONE.
WE NEED YOUR HELP.
OHLONE HAS DONE THEIR PART.


[Captioner] 19:37:03
WE'RE OUT OF MONEY.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.


[Captioner] 19:37:08
>> Ms. Gauthier: THANK YOU.
THE NEXT SPEAKER IS DOTTIE.


[Captioner] 19:37:13
AND SUNIL SINGH TURNED IN

[Captioner] 19:37:17
 A CARD BUT DID NOT NOTE WHICH ITEM.
IF YOU CAN PLEASE TELL ME

[Captioner] 19:37:21
 WHICH ITEM YOU WANT TO SPEAK ON?


[Captioner] 19:37:29
>> GOOD EVENING.


[Captioner] 19:37:43
>> Mayor Mei: WELCOME, DOTTIE.
>> HI, GOOD EVENING TO EVERYONE.
I'M HERE

[Captioner] 19:37:48
 KIND OF AS AN INDEPENDENT BUT ALSO AS A BUSINESS OWNER IN

[Captioner] 19:37:52
 FREMONT.
MY BUSINESS IS FOUR PAWS SPAY AND NEUTER

[Captioner] 19:37:56
 CLINIC.
I WAS AN EMPLOYEE FOR THE CITY OF FREMONT FOR THE

[Captioner] 19:38:00
 TRI-CITY ANIMAL SHELTER FOR NEAR 20 YEARS, AND UNFORTUNATELY,

[Captioner] 19:38:05
 THIS IS A VERY REPETITIVE CONVERSATION.
SO HISTORICALLY, THE

[Captioner] 19:38:10
 SHELTER HAS PROVIDED SOME LIMITED SERVICES FOR THE FREMONT

[Captioner] 19:38:15
 RESIDENTS, AND IT JUST SEEMS TO GO UP AND DOWN ON A STEADY,

[Captioner] 19:38:19
 STEADY BASIS, AND UNTIL SOMEONE ACTUALLY TAKES AN INTEREST IN THE

[Captioner] 19:38:24
 SHELTER, I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT'S GOING TO CHANGE.
OHLONE

[Captioner] 19:38:28
 HUMANE SOCIETY HAS SUPPORTED THE PUBLIC OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF

[Captioner] 19:38:32
 YEARS AS THE SHELTER, QUOTE, QUOTE, TRIES TO GET THEIR

[Captioner] 19:38:36
 ACT TOGETHER.
I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING THERE ANY

[Captioner] 19:38:40
 LONGER.
I DON'T KEEP IN CONTACT WITH ANYONE AT THE SHELTER

[Captioner] 19:38:45
 REALLY.
BUT I WILL TELL YOU WORKING THERE, I WAS A WITNESS

[Captioner] 19:38:49
 TO THE ONGOING TURNOVER OF EMPLOYEES.
THE ONGOING

[Captioner] 19:38:53
 STRESSES OF SHELTERING.
THIS IS NOT NEW.
IT'S NOT DIFFERENT.


[Captioner] 19:38:57
BUT IT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED AND I DON'T KNOW THAT ANYONE

[Captioner] 19:39:01
 REALLY IS GOING TO TAKE THAT ON.
SO I GUESS

[Captioner] 19:39:06
 THAT'S KIND OF THE QUESTION AS TO WHO'S REALLY GOING TO GET IN DEPTH, THERE'S A LOT OF

[Captioner] 19:39:10
 THINGS GOING ON IN THE CITY OF FREMONT, THERE'S NO DOUBT, BUT THE SHELTER SEEMS TO ALWAYS SLIDE TO THE

[Captioner] 19:39:16
 BOTTOM, AND I DO HOPE THAT YOU WILL ADDRESS THAT AND ALSO DISCUSS

[Captioner] 19:39:20
 POSSIBLE CHANGES WITH THE DIRECTOR OF OHLONE HUMANE SOCIETY.
THEY REALLY DO

[Captioner] 19:39:25
 A WONDERFUL THING AS FAR AS COMMUNICATION, COMMUNITY

[Captioner] 19:39:29
 SUPPORT, EDUCATION IS INTENSE, AND FOUR PAWS IS THERE TO SUPPORT THEM

[Captioner] 19:39:33
 AS BEST WE CAN.
WE HAVE VERY LIMITED SERVICES, BUT WE DO TRY AND HELP AS MUCH AS

[Captioner] 19:39:37
 WE CAN.
TO THE TUNE OF 30 SURGERIES A DAY.
SO THERE YOU HAVE IT.


[Captioner] 19:39:41
PLEASE HELP OHLONE AND PLEASE GET SOMEONE TO IDENTIFY WITH THE SHELTER.


[Captioner] 19:39:46
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:39:52
>> Ms. Gauthier: SUNIL SINGH FOLLOWED BY

[Captioner] 19:39:57
 SUNITA LODA.
>>

[Captioner] 19:40:02
 GOOD EVENING.
THIS IS SUNIL SINGH FROM

[Captioner] 19:40:06
 FREMONT, PERALTA BOULEVARD RESIDENT.
I WOULD LIKE TO

[Captioner] 19:40:11
 DRAW THE ATTENTION OF THE ROAD CONDITION, PERALTA AND

[Captioner] 19:40:15
 THORNTON AREA,

[Captioner] 19:40:20
 ROAD CONDITION IS NOT NICE, PARTICULARLY PERALTA AND THORNTON IS

[Captioner] 19:40:24
 VERY BAD.
YOU GO, VERY BIG BUMP, ON PERALTA THERE'S A

[Captioner] 19:40:28
 VERY BIG BUMP, AND I WAS HEARING SINCE TWO YEARS THAT PERALTA

[Captioner] 19:40:33
 ROAD HAS BEEN TAKEN BY THE FREMONT CITY BUT NOTHING IS

[Captioner] 19:40:37
 HAPPENING, NO CONSTRUCTION THING IS HAPPENING.
A LOT OF

[Captioner] 19:40:41
 MONEY HAS BEEN SPENT IN MAKING CONGESTION, MAKING

[Captioner] 19:40:45
 A BIKE LANE FOR THAT WHICH IS OF NO USE.
ANY PUBLIC YOU GO AND ASK, WHICH IS

[Captioner] 19:40:49
 HAVING NO USE, AND -- OR MAKING THE ROAD, YOU DON'T HAVE MONEY.
I

[Captioner] 19:40:54
 DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS LOGIC.
AND ALSO

[Captioner] 19:40:59
 NEAR TO ARTIST WALK, THE ROAD WAS TWO LANE,

[Captioner] 19:41:03
 BUILDER HAS BEEN GIVEN

[Captioner] 19:41:07
 PERMISSION, NOW THE PARKING LOT, ONLY ONE LANE IS THERE WHICH

[Captioner] 19:41:12
 MAKES A VERY BIG QUEUE.
I DON'T KNOW WHO

[Captioner] 19:41:16
 IS DOING THIS KIND OF PLANNING.
I COULD HAVE THOUGHT SO MANY

[Captioner] 19:41:20
 TIMES TO GO TO THE PLANNING DEPARTMENT AND RAISE THIS QUESTION BUT SOMEHOW I COULD NOT MAKE IT.


[Captioner] 19:41:25
AND THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE.
THAT'S WHAT I WANTED TO RAISE

[Captioner] 19:41:30
 MY CONCERN, ROAD CONDITION IN GENERAL, FREMONT.


[Captioner] 19:41:34
SO MORE ATTENTION SHOULD BE GIVEN ON THE

[Captioner] 19:41:37
 ROAD CONDITION THAN ANY OTHER THINGS.
THANK YOU.
>> Ms. Gauthier: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:41:42
THE LAST SPEAKER IS

[Captioner] 19:41:46
 SUNITA.
>> HI.
I WOULD LIKE TO THANK

[Captioner] 19:41:51
 THE FREMONT CITY COUNCIL AND HONORABLE

[Captioner] 19:41:55
 MAYOR AND I WOULD LIKE TO ESPECIALLY THANK GOVERNOR GAVIN

[Captioner] 19:41:59
 NEWSOM FOR -- THE

[Captioner] 19:42:04
 BILL 403.

[Captioner] 19:42:10
 HINDU,, MANY WHO HAVE COME OUT TO HELP THE HINDU COMMUNITY, AND

[Captioner] 19:42:14
 I HOPE THAT WE DON'T HAVE SUCH BILL PRESENTED IN THE

[Captioner] 19:42:18
 FREMONT COUNCIL AND THANK YOU TO FREMONT CITY COUNCIL FOR

[Captioner] 19:42:23
 SUPPORTING US IN SB403 BILL TO OPPOSE IT, AND I JUST

[Captioner] 19:42:28
 HOPE THAT FREMONT CITY ALSO FOCUSES

[Captioner] 19:42:34
 AND -- TO CONTROL THE CRIME IN THE CITY AND HELP THIS HOMELESSNESS BY

[Captioner] 19:42:38
 PROVIDING SHELTER TO THE HOMELESSNESS SO WE DON'T HAVE MORE CRIME.
I WOULD LIKE TO THANK

[Captioner] 19:42:42
 FREMONT CITY FOR DOING A GREAT JOB.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:42:51
>> Ms. Gauthier: THAT'S THE LAST SPEAKER UNDER ORAL COMMUNICATIONS.
>> Mayor Mei: SO I JUST

[Captioner] 19:42:55
 WANT TO SAY REAL BRIEFLY THAT ORAL COMMUNICATIONS ARE ITEMS THAT ARE NOT AGENDIZED

[Captioner] 19:42:59
 BUT PLEASE NOTE THAT THE COMMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN PROVIDED -- IS THERE ONE MORE

[Captioner] 19:43:03
 CARD?
OKAY.
COMMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN PROVIDED TO

[Captioner] 19:43:06
 THE COUNCIL --
>> Ms. Gauthier: SORRY, YES, THERE ARE TWO MORE CARDS HERE.


[Captioner] 19:43:10
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY.


[Captioner] 19:43:20
SORRY, RANJITA FOLLOWED BY KATHY WILLIAMS.


[Captioner] 19:43:24
>> Mayor Mei: WELCOME, RANJITA.
>> THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK.


[Captioner] 19:43:30
>> Mayor Mei: COULD YOU GET A LITTLE CLOSER, PLEASE?
I'M SORRY, I CAN'T HEAR YOU.


[Captioner] 19:43:39
>> FIRST I WANT TO THANK GOVERNOR NEWSOM AND THE FREMONT CITY

[Captioner] 19:43:43
 COUNCIL, THE TOWNSHIP OF FREMONT FOR RECOGNIZING THE DIVISIVE AND

[Captioner] 19:43:49
 HINDUPHOBIC BILL AND VETOING 403(B).
SECONDLY, AFTER HEARING ALL THE COMMENTS

[Captioner] 19:43:54
 AND THE PLEAS FOR HELP WITH ALL THE FUNDING NEEDED FOR

[Captioner] 19:43:58
 ANIMALS AROUND FREMONT AND ANYBODY HAS TO TAKE A WALK AROUND CENTRAL PARK TO

[Captioner] 19:44:02
 RECOGNIZE THE EXPLOSION IN THE FERAL CAT POPULATION, I WONDER

[Captioner] 19:44:06
 IF THAT MONEY THAT SENATOR WAHAB HAD

[Captioner] 19:44:11
 USED WAS FROM THE GOVERNMENT AND HER

[Captioner] 19:44:16
 OWN PERSONAL FUNDRAISING TO ACTUALLY CONTRIBUTE TO SOMETHING THAT IS MORE MEANINGFUL AND A

[Captioner] 19:44:20
 PROBLEM THAT ACTUALLY EXISTED RATHER THAN SOMETHING SUCH

[Captioner] 19:44:25
 AS CASTE THAT BEFORE SHE INTRODUCED FOUR SEE OWE

[Captioner] 19:44:28
 3B IF YOU ASKED THE AVERAGE CITIZEN WHAT CAST IS, NOBODY WOULD KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.


[Captioner] 19:44:33
SO I WOULD AGAIN COMMEND THE CITY FOR DOING THE RIGHT THING, BUT AT THE SAME

[Captioner] 19:44:39
 TIME, RE-THINKING WHAT'S THE BEST PLACE TO INVEST OUR FUNDRAISING DOLLARS.


[Captioner] 19:44:43
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:44:49
>> Ms. Gauthier: KATHY WILLIAMS.


[Captioner] 19:44:54
AND THERE ARE NO OTHER CARDS IN THE TRAY, MADAME MAYOR, SO THIS WILL BE THE LAST SPEAKER.


[Captioner] 19:44:58
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
>> GOOD EVENING.
I CAME HERE THIS

[Captioner] 19:45:02
 EVENING TO SUPPORT A GROUP.
I HAD NO

[Captioner] 19:45:06
 INTENTIONS OF GETTING UP AND SPEAKING.
OTHERWISE I MIGHT HAVE DONE SOMETHING 

[Captioner] 19:45:10
WITH MY HAIR AND SLAPPED ON A LITTLE BIT OF MAKEUP.


[Captioner] 19:45:14
SO HERE I AM.
OHS IS OUT OF MONEY BUT I DON'T

[Captioner] 19:45:19
 THINK THAT OUR SHELTER IS.
ON AUGUST 19TH, I

[Captioner] 19:45:23
 DEPOSITED A CHECK IN THE DROPBOX FOR LICENSING.


[Captioner] 19:45:28
IT TOOK THEM UP UNTIL TWO DAYS AGO TO PUT

[Captioner] 19:45:32
 MY CHECK THROUGH.
TRYING TO CALL THE

[Captioner] 19:45:37
 SHELTER IS RIDICULOUS.
THERE IS NOBODY ANSWERING PHONES.


[Captioner] 19:45:41
THIS SHELTER IN FREMONT IS A DISGRACE IN COMPARISON TO THE

[Captioner] 19:45:45
 SHELTERS THAT SURROUND OUR BAY AREA.
I'D LIKE TO GIVE YOU

[Captioner] 19:45:49
 A LITTLE STATISTIC THAT

[Captioner] 19:45:54
 MIGHT HELP SHOCK YOU INTO HELPING OHS AND DOING SOMETHING

[Captioner] 19:45:58
 WITH OUR SHELTER.
ONE FEMALE KITTEN

[Captioner] 19:46:03
 AND ONE MALE KITTEN THAT ARE NOT SPAYED OR NEUTERED IN SEVEN YEARS

[Captioner] 19:46:08
 CAN PRODUCE 420,000 KITTENS.


[Captioner] 19:46:12
IF WE DON'T START WORKING ON THIS SITUATION NOW, YOU WILL BE

[Captioner] 19:46:16
 HEARING FROM ALL OF THESE RESIDENTS IN FREMONT, NEWARK,

[Captioner] 19:46:20
 AND UNION CITY.
BECAUSE NOBODY

[Captioner] 19:46:25
 WANTS THAT MANY CATS IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD.


[Captioner] 19:46:29
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME.


[Captioner] 19:46:33
[APPLAUSE]


[Captioner] 19:46:39
>> Mayor Mei: THAT'S THE LAST OF OUR SPEAKERS.
AT THIS TIME I'M GOING TO CLOSE ORAL 

[Captioner] 19:46:44
COMMUNICATION.
I WANTED TO SAY AGAIN THAT SINCE ITEMS ARE NOT AGENDIZED, WE WILL NOT BE

[Captioner] 19:46:48
 DIRECTLY ADDRESSING THEM BUT WE WILL BE FOLLOWING UP AND I KNOW THAT OUR STAFF HAS TAKEN DOWN NOTES

[Captioner] 19:46:54
 ON THIS, SO I'M SURE WE'LL BE FOLLOWING UP WITH OUR DIFFERENT

[Captioner] 19:46:58
 DEPARTMENTS FROM THE TRI-CITY ANIMAL SHELTER TO OUR

[Captioner] 19:47:03
 PUBLIC WORKS AND OTHER DEPARTMENTS SUCH AS HUMAN SERVICES, AND PLEASE NOTE THAT

[Captioner] 19:47:07
 ALL THESE ARE CONSIDERED PART OF PUBLIC RECORDS.


[Captioner] 19:47:13
NEXT ON OUR AGENDA ITEM THIS EVENING IS ACTUALLY

[Captioner] 19:47:17
 ITEM 6A, A CLIMATE READY FREMONT PLAN.
AND SO I'D LIKE TO

[Captioner] 19:47:22
 INVITE OUR SUSTAINABILITY MANAGER RACHEL DIFRANCO,

[Captioner] 19:47:26
 WHO WILL PROVIDE A PRESENTATION, AND ALSO PLEASE NOTE THAT THERE WAS A

[Captioner] 19:47:30
 GREEN SHEET THAT WAS UPDATED BY HER STAFF, AND ALSO DAN SCHOENHOLZ.


[Captioner] 19:47:35
WELCOME THIS EVENING, AND THANKS FOR JOINING US.


[Captioner] 19:47:52
>> GOOD EVENING, MADAME MAYOR, VICE MAYOR COX AND THE REST OF THE CITY COUNCIL.


[Captioner] 19:47:56
THANK YOU FOR HAVING US TONIGHT.
ARE WE GETTING THE

[Captioner] 19:48:00
 SLIDES UP?
SO I'D LIKE TO THANK

[Captioner] 19:48:06
 YOU FOR

[Captioner] 19:48:17
 -- I'M HERE TO PRESENT THE

[Captioner] 19:48:22
 CLIMATE PLAN.
WE'VE MADE SOME REVISIONS TO THE

[Captioner] 19:48:26
 PLAN AND ARE BRINGING YOU THE FINAL PLAN TONIGHT.
FIRST I

[Captioner] 19:48:30
 WANT TO GIVE JUST A QUICK BACKGROUND ON

[Captioner] 19:48:34
 OUR CLIMATE ACTION PLANNING EFFORTS AND HOW WE GOT TO THIS POINT TODAY.
SO AS YOU ARE AWARE, OUR GENERAL PLAN

[Captioner] 19:48:39
 WAS ADOPTED IN 2011 AND THAT SET FORTH A VISION FOR FREMONT TO

[Captioner] 19:48:44
 TRANSITION FROM AN AUTO ORIENTED SUBURB TO A SUSTAINABLE STRATEGICALLY

[Captioner] 19:48:48
 URBAN AND MODERN CITY.
AND THE GENERAL PLAN MEMORIALIZED OUR GOAL OF

[Captioner] 19:48:52
 REDUCING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS 25% FROM A 2005

[Captioner] 19:48:57
 BASELINE LEVEL BY THE YEAR 2020.
OUR CLIMATE ACTION PLAN FOLLOWED A YEAR

[Captioner] 19:49:03
 LATER, AND THAT REALLY SET A PATHWAY FOR HOW WE COULD REDUCE EMISSIONS OVER

[Captioner] 19:49:07
 THE NEXT YEARS TO ACHIEVE THAT

[Captioner] 19:49:12
 GOAL.
IN 2018, WE ACTUALLY ACHIEVED

[Captioner] 19:49:16
 A 24% REDUCTION FROM OUR 2005 BASELINE.
AND SO

[Captioner] 19:49:21
 IN 2019, THE CITY COUNCIL AS RECOMMENDED BY THE ENVIRONMENTAL

[Captioner] 19:49:26
 SUSTAINABILITY COMMISSION ADOPTED A CARBON NEUTRALITY

[Captioner] 19:49:30
 RESOLUTION TO LOOK TOWARD A LONG TERM NEUTRALITY GOAL BY THE

[Captioner] 19:49:34
 YEAR 2045, WHICH IS IN ALIGNMENT WITH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA'S GOALS FOR

[Captioner] 19:49:39
 GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS AND A TARGET AT A

[Captioner] 19:49:43
 COMMUNITY WIDE LEVEL BY 55% FROM OUR SAME 2005 BASELINE YEAR.


[Captioner] 19:49:47
THAT REDUCTION IS EQUIVALENT TO 30% REDUCTION FROM OUR 2018

[Captioner] 19:49:54
 BASELINE.


[Captioner] 19:50:01
SO GOALS OF THE CLIMATE READY FREMONT PLAN ARE THREE FOLD.
FIRST WE'RE

[Captioner] 19:50:06
 FOCUSING ON GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION REDUCTIONS OR CLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION AND

[Captioner] 19:50:10
 REALLY LOOKING AT MEASURES THAT WILL ACHIEVE OUR 2030 GOAL OF REDUCING EMISSIONS BY

[Captioner] 19:50:14
 30%.
IN ADDITION TO THAT, WE'RE PRESENTING

[Captioner] 19:50:18
 A PLAN THAT REALLY ADDRESSES CLIMATE ADAPTATION AND RESILIENCY IN A

[Captioner] 19:50:22
 MUCH MORE ROBUST WAY THAN WE DID IN OUR FIRST CLIMATE ACTION PLAN, SO REALLY LOOKING AT

[Captioner] 19:50:27
 WAYS THAT THE CITY CAN PREPARE AND RESPOND AND ADAPT TO A CHANGING CLIMATE

[Captioner] 19:50:31
 AROUND US.
AND THINK ABOUT WHAT THE FUTURE EFFECTS

[Captioner] 19:50:35
 OF CLIMATE CHANGE MIGHT BE IN OUR COMMUNITY.
THE THIRD IS

[Captioner] 19:50:39
 TO PROVIDE CEQA STREAMLINING FOR DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS.
SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT

[Captioner] 19:50:43
 OUR FIRST CLIMATE ACTION PLAN DID NOT DO, WHERE WE'RE LOOKING AT

[Captioner] 19:50:48
 DISCRETIONARY PROJECTS AND THEIR ABILITY TO TIER OFF OF OUR CLIMATE ACTION PLAN UTILIZING THE

[Captioner] 19:50:52
 EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS THAT WE'VE CALCULATED FROM OUR CLIMATE

[Captioner] 19:50:56
 ACTION PLAN AS A WAY TO ADDRESS THEIR CLIMATE MITIGATION

[Captioner] 19:51:01
 NEEDS.


[Captioner] 19:51:06
IN TERMS OF COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT IN PREPARATION FOR THE PLAN, WE KICKED

[Captioner] 19:51:10
 OFF A SERIES OF CONVERSATIONS WITH THE COMMUNITY.


[Captioner] 19:51:15
WE HAD KEY STAKEHOLDER CONVERSATIONS WITH DOZENS

[Captioner] 19:51:19
 OF COMMUNITY GROUPS, WE TALKED TO A NUMBER OF BOARDS AND

[Captioner] 19:51:23
 COMMISSIONS.
WE KICKED OFF A VIRTUAL WORKSHOP IN SEPTEMBER

[Captioner] 19:51:28
 OF 2020 WITH 160 PARTICIPANTS AND HAD A SERIES OF

[Captioner] 19:51:33
 LUNCHTIME CLIMATE TALKS.
WE ALSO LAUNCHED A VIRTUAL COMMUNITY FORUM

[Captioner] 19:51:37
 CALLED CONSIDERATE, WHERE WE PRESENTED POSSIBLE MEASURES THAT COULD

[Captioner] 19:51:41
 GO INTO THE CLIMATE ACTION PLAN AND GOT A NUMBER OF COMMENTS FROM THE PUBLIC ON IF THEY

[Captioner] 19:51:46
 SUPPORTED THOSE MEASURES AND THEY COULD ALSO PRESENT THEIR OWN

[Captioner] 19:51:50
 MEASURES.
THEN WE TOOK ALL OF THAT INFORMATION AND WORKED WITH A TECHNICAL

[Captioner] 19:51:55
 CONSULTANT FROM ASCENT ENVIRONMENTAL TO CALCULATE EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH

[Captioner] 19:51:59
 VARIOUS MEASURES THAT HAVE ULTIMATELY MADE THEIR WAY INTO THE

[Captioner] 19:52:03
 CLIMATE READY FREMONT PLAN THAT YOU SEE BEFORE YOU TODAY.


[Captioner] 19:52:08
WE HAD PREPARED A DRAFT CLIMATE ACTION PLAN THAT WE BROUGHT TO OUR SUSTAINABILITY

[Captioner] 19:52:12
 COMMISSION AND TO CITY COUNCIL EARLIER THIS SUMMER, AND

[Captioner] 19:52:16
 THEN WITH THE COUNCIL'S APPROVAL PUT THAT

[Captioner] 19:52:21
 OUT UTILIZING THE MYFREMONT PLATFORM FOR COMMUNITY

[Captioner] 19:52:25
 COMMENT.
WE HAD 77 PEOPLE COMMENT ON THE PLAN AND ALL OF THAT FEEDBACK FROM COUNCIL 

[Captioner] 19:52:29
FROM THE COMMISSION AND FROM THE PUBLIC HAS BEEN INCORPORATED INTO

[Captioner] 19:52:33
 THE FINAL PLAN THAT YOU SEE BEFORE YOU.


[Captioner] 19:52:41
IN TERMS OF OUR GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION REDUCTION

[Captioner] 19:52:45
 TARGETS, THE CLIMATE READY FREMONT PLAN ACTUALLY EXCEEDS OUR 2030 GOAL BY REDUCING

[Captioner] 19:52:49
 EMISSIONS BY 39%.


[Captioner] 19:52:53
AND IN TERMS OF THE LONG TERM TRAJECTORY FOR CARBON NEUTRALITY WE STILL, WITH

[Captioner] 19:52:57
 THE MEASURES THE IN PLAN, WILL NOT ACHIEVE CARBON NEUTRALITY

[Captioner] 19:53:02
 BY 2045, BUT THE PLAN IS REALLY FOCUSED ON THE

[Captioner] 19:53:06
 NEXT SEVEN YEARS OF IMPLEMENTATION THROUGH 2030, AND WE RECOGNIZE THERE WILL BE A

[Captioner] 19:53:11
 NUMBER OF POLICY CHANGES AT THE STATE LEVEL AS WELL AS TECHNOLOGY CHANGES THAT LIMB

[Captioner] 19:53:15
 PACT OUR ABILITY TO ACTUALLY ACHIEVE OUR LONG TERM CARBON NEUTRALITY

[Captioner] 19:53:19
 GOAL, AND SO THIS PLAN IS REALLY FOCUSED ON MEETING AND EXCEEDING OUR 2030

[Captioner] 19:53:23
 TARGET, AND THEN COMING BACK AND UPDATING THE PLAN AGAIN

[Captioner] 19:53:28
 TO WORK TOWARD CARBON NEUTRALITY AT A LATER TIME.
ONE OF THE THINGS

[Captioner] 19:53:32
 I WANTED TO POINT OUT ON THE SLIDE ACTUALLY IS IF YOU LOOK AT THE

[Captioner] 19:53:36
 EMISSIONS BY SECTOR, BUILDING

[Captioner] 19:53:40
 ENERGY AND ONWARD TRANSPORTATION MAKE UP THE BULK OF EMISSIONS AND THOSE ARE THE

[Captioner] 19:53:45
 SECTORS THAT WE'RE REALLY SEEING THE ABILITY TO REDUCE EMISSION AND WITH THE CLIMATE READY FREMONT

[Captioner] 19:53:49
 PLAN.


[Captioner] 19:53:53
IN TERMS OF THE CONTENT OF THE

[Captioner] 19:53:58
 PLAN, OUR CHAPTERS KIND OF FLOW IN TERMS OF EXECUTIVE SUMMARY, WE HAVE AB INTRODUCTION OF ALL THE MEASURES

[Captioner] 19:54:02
 WITHIN THE PLAN, CHAPTER 1 PROVIDES

[Captioner] 19:54:06
 AN OVERVIEW OF THE WORK THAT WE'VE DONE IN TERMS OF PAST CLIMATE ACTION

[Captioner] 19:54:12
 IMPLEMENTATION, AS WELL AS THE OUTREACH THAT WE'VE CONDUCTED AROUND THIS PLAN

[Captioner] 19:54:17
 UPDATE PROCESS.
CHAPTER 2 PRESENTS A LONG-TERM

[Captioner] 19:54:22
 EMISSIONS FORECAST IF NO NEW CLIMATE ACTIONS ARE TAKEN BY THE YEAR 2045, SO IT'S REALLY

[Captioner] 19:54:27
 LOOKING AT BASED ON CURRENT POLICY ADOPTED AT THE STATE LEVEL, WHAT WOULD HAPPEN

[Captioner] 19:54:32
 TO LONG TERM GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS OVER TIME.
SO IT'S A NO

[Captioner] 19:54:36
 LOCAL ACTION SCENARIO.
AND THEN CHAPTER 3 GOES INTO A SERIES OF MEASURES

[Captioner] 19:54:40
 THAT THE CITY OF FREMONT CAN UNDERTAKE WITHIN OUR OWN OPERATIONS AND ON

[Captioner] 19:54:45
 A COMMUNITY SCALE TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS SO THAT WE CAN ACHIEVE

[Captioner] 19:54:50
 OUR 2030 GOAL AND REDUCE EMISSIONS BEYOND

[Captioner] 19:54:54
 THAT LONG TERM FORECAST OF NO LOCAL ACTION.
CHAPTER 4 FOCUSES

[Captioner] 19:54:58
 ON IMPLEMENTATION AND MONITORING AND PRESENTS A GAME PLAN

[Captioner] 19:55:02
 FOR SHORT TERM PRIORITY IMPLEMENTATION ACTIONS THAT THE CITY PLANS TO

[Captioner] 19:55:06
 UNDERTAKE OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS.
BOTH AT THE COMMUNITY SCALE AND THE MUNICIPAL LEVEL.


[Captioner] 19:55:10
AND THEN WE HAVE A SERIES OF APPENDICES THAT PROVIDE ALL OF THE TECHNICAL

[Captioner] 19:55:14
 ANALYSIS BEHIND THE EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS CALCULATIONS IN THE PLAN.


[Captioner] 19:55:22
SO I WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT FOR YOU SOME OF THE MEASURES WITH THE LARGEST

[Captioner] 19:55:26
 GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS.
AS YOU RECALL FROM THE CHART I PROVIDED A COUPLE SLIDES BACK,

[Captioner] 19:55:30
 THE LARGEST SECTORS OF EMISSIONS ARE TRANSPORTATION AND THE BUILDING

[Captioner] 19:55:34
 SECTOR, AND THAT'S REALLY WHERE WE CAN SEE THE DEEPEST EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS WITH THE PLAN.


[Captioner] 19:55:38
SO THE FOCUS IS ON ELECTRIFICATION OF BOTH OUR BUILDING

[Captioner] 19:55:43
 SECTOR AND OUR TRANSPORTATION SECTOR.
SO YOU CAN SEE WITH

[Captioner] 19:55:49
 THE FIRST MEASURE THAT IS LISTED HERE, INSTALLING INFRASTRUCTURE

[Captioner] 19:55:53
 TO SUPPORT ELECTRIFICATION OF OUR VEHICLES IS GOING TO ACHIEVE 28% OF THE TOTAL EMISSIONS

[Captioner] 19:55:57
 THAT WE'VE CALCULATED WE CAN ACHIEVE BY 2030.
AND THEN THE

[Captioner] 19:56:01
 NEXT TWO MEASURES, MEASURE BU-1 WHICH IS THE

[Captioner] 19:56:05
 TRANSITION TO CLEAN ENERGY, WILL FOCUS ON TAPERING

[Captioner] 19:56:09
 OFF OF THE USE OF -- REDUCING THE EMISSIONS ASSOCIATED

[Captioner] 19:56:13
 WITH ELECTRICITY FROM NON-RENEWABLE SOURCES LIKE

[Captioner] 19:56:17
 FOSSIL FUELS, AND THEN MEASURE BU-4 WHICH IS FOCUSED ON

[Captioner] 19:56:22
 RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS AND THEN A SEPARATE MEASURE WHICH HAS AN

[Captioner] 19:56:26
 ADDITIONAL 4% REDUCTION, SO TOGETHER 18% IS FOCUSED ON

[Captioner] 19:56:30
 THE EMISSION REDUCTIONS WE CAN ACHIEVE IN THE EXISTING BUILDING SECTOR.
SO ALL

[Captioner] 19:56:35
 TOGETHER, THOSE THREE THAT YOU SEE THERE AND THEN THE FOURTH THAT I MENTIONED WILL

[Captioner] 19:56:39
 ACHIEVE ABOUT A 64% REDUCTION IN OUR EMISSIONS

[Captioner] 19:56:43
 BY 2030.
I WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT

[Captioner] 19:56:47
 A FEW OF THE PRIORITY ACTIONS WITHIN THE GAME

[Captioner] 19:56:51
 PLAN FOCUSED AROUND THE FIRST YEAR OF

[Captioner] 19:56:55
 IMPLEMENTATION AT THE COMMUNITY LEVEL.
WE'RE LOOKING TO ESTABLISH THE

[Captioner] 19:57:00
 RENEWABLE 100 RATE PLAN UNDER WHAT IS CURRENTLY KNOWN AS EAST BAY COMMUNITY ENERGY

[Captioner] 19:57:04
 BUT TRANSITIONING ITS NAME TO AVA COMMUNITY ENERGY AS THE DEFAULT

[Captioner] 19:57:08
 FOR RESIDENTS AND BUSINESSES.
SO THAT ACHIEVES THE

[Captioner] 19:57:12
 GOAL OF THE CLEAN ENERGY MEASURE THAT I MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY.
WE'RE

[Captioner] 19:57:17
 ALSO LOOKING AT PROPOSING REACH CODES FOR BUILDING

[Captioner] 19:57:21
 ELECTRIFICATION, ELECTRIC VEHICLE READINESS AND GREEN BUILDING IN NEW CONSTRUCTION.


[Captioner] 19:57:25
THERE'S A NUMBER OF OTHER MEASURES HERE

[Captioner] 19:57:29
 FOCUSED ON ENGAGING WITH THE SCHOOLS TO IMPLEMENT SAFE

[Captioner] 19:57:33
 ROUTES TO SCHOOL, AND FOCUSING ON PLASTIC

[Captioner] 19:57:37
 WASTE AND ORGANICS WASTE REDUCTION AND PROPER MANAGEMENT.
THERE'S

[Captioner] 19:57:42
 ALSO A FOCUS ON TREE

[Captioner] 19:57:46
 PLANTING IN ALIGNMENT WITH OUR URBAN FORESTRY MANAGEMENT PLAN AND ALSO

[Captioner] 19:57:50
 LAUNCHING A PUBLIC-FACING DASHBOARD TO TRACK PROGRESS ON THE IMPLEMENTATION

[Captioner] 19:57:54
 OF CLIMATE-READY FREMONT.


[Captioner] 19:57:58
IN TERMS OF CITY OPERATIONAL ACTIONS, WE'RE

[Captioner] 19:58:03
 LOOKING AT PROPOSING A

[Captioner] 19:58:08
 ALL-ELECTRIC OR ZERO NET ENERGY DESIGN REQUIREMENT FOR CITY FACILITIES THAT WOULD

[Captioner] 19:58:12
 UPDATE OUR EXISTING SUSTAINABILITY POLICY ADOPTED BACK IN 2006.
WE'RE ALSO LOOKING AT

[Captioner] 19:58:17
 REPLACING EXISTING GAS POWER HVAC SYSTEMS IN

[Captioner] 19:58:21
 OUR CITY BUILDINGS WITH HEAT PUMPS AND CONTINUING TO UPDATE

[Captioner] 19:58:25
 OUR CITY FLEET VEHICLES WITH ELECTRIC VEHICLES, REALLY FOCUSING ON INSTALLING

[Captioner] 19:58:30
 THE SUPPORTING CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE.
THOSE TWO MEASURES HAVE BEEN FUNDED 

[Captioner] 19:58:34
UNDER THE CITY'S CIP THAT WAS RECENTLY ADOPTED THIS YEAR.
WE'RE ALSO

[Captioner] 19:58:40
 LOOKINGALITY OTHER ACTIONS THAT WOULD FOCUS ON UTILIZING REUSABLE

[Captioner] 19:58:45
 FOODWARE AT SOME OF OUR CITY FACILITIES, DOING

[Captioner] 19:58:49
 A WASTE AUDIT AT CITY FACILITIES TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE INCREASING OUR OWN

[Captioner] 19:58:53
 WASTE DIVERSION EFFORTS, APPLYING ADDITIONAL MULCH AT CITY FACILITIES IN

[Captioner] 19:58:57
 ALIGNMENT WITH THE GOALS OF SB1383, AND THEN

[Captioner] 19:59:02
 FOCUSING ON GREEN PURCHASING IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR UPDATED ENVIRONMENTAL

[Captioner] 19:59:06
 PURCHASING POLICY.


[Captioner] 19:59:11
IN TERMS OF PREPARING THE FINAL DRAFT OF CLIMATE-READY FREMONT, WE

[Captioner] 19:59:16
 DID MAKE A NUMBER OF CHANGES I ATTACHED A DOCUMENT TO

[Captioner] 19:59:20
 THE STAFF REPORT THAT HIGHLIGHTS ALL THE CHANGES MADE, BUT I WANTED TO MENTION

[Captioner] 19:59:25
 A FEW HERE.
SO FIRST I ALREADY MENTIONED EAST BAY COMMUNITY ENERGY

[Captioner] 19:59:29
 IS CHANGING THEIR NAME TO AVA SO IN THE PLAN WE'RE REFERENCING AVA THROUGHOUT

[Captioner] 19:59:33
 THE DOCUMENT.
WE'VE ALSO MADE SOME CHANGES TO SOME OF

[Captioner] 19:59:37
 THE SPECIFIC ACTION LEVEL LANGUAGE WHERE WE HEARD FROM THE PUBLIC

[Captioner] 19:59:42
 OR FROM COUNCIL OR THE SUSTAINABILITY COMMISSION THAT IT WAS UNCLEAR WE

[Captioner] 19:59:46
 NEEDED MORE SPECIFICITY.
WE ALSO PROVIDED SOME

[Captioner] 19:59:51
 LANGUAGE AROUND THE CONSUMER CHOICE THAT

[Captioner] 19:59:55
 IS STILL AVAILABLE TO RESIDENTS AND BUSINESSES

[Captioner] 20:00:00
 REGARDING THE OPT UP TO RENEWABLE 100 FOR THE AVA RATE PLAN.
WE RECEIVED

[Captioner] 20:00:05
 SOME FEEDBACK FROM THE ALAMEDA COUNTY WATER DISTRICT REGARDING SOME OF THE ASSUMPTIONS WE

[Captioner] 20:00:09
 HAD FOR WATER USE REDUCTIONS AND INCORPORATED THOSE INTO OUR

[Captioner] 20:00:13
 CALCULATIONS.
WE ALSO PROVIDED -- OR

[Captioner] 20:00:17
 CLARIFIED THAT THE GAME PLAN WILL BE UPDATED ON A

[Captioner] 20:00:21
 THREE-YEAR BASIS SO AFTER THE FIRST THREE YEARS OF IMPLEMENTATION, WE WILL REVIEW THE

[Captioner] 20:00:26
 GAME PLAN AND PROVIDE SOME UPDATES TO THAT.


[Captioner] 20:00:30
AND THEN WE ALSO WHERE APPROPRIATE UPDATED TIMES IN THE GAME PLAN

[Captioner] 20:00:34
 FOR SPECIFIC ACTIONS.


[Captioner] 20:00:39
FINALLY I WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT THAT THE STAFF REPORT

[Captioner] 20:00:44
 INCLUDES AN AGENERAL DUMB TO THE GENERAL PLAN EIR FOR THE

[Captioner] 20:00:49
 CAP UPDATE, THE SPECIFIC ADAPTATION MEASURES WITHIN THE CLIMATE ACTION

[Captioner] 20:00:53
 PLAN AND DEMONSTRATES THAT THE CLIMATE READY FREMONT PLAN WON'T RESULT IN

[Captioner] 20:00:57
 ANY NEW OR SUBSTANTIALLY MORE SEVERE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS THAN THOSE ALREADY

[Captioner] 20:01:01
 IDENTIFIED IN THE GENERAL PLAN UPDATE EIR AND THIS ALLOWS FOR

[Captioner] 20:01:08
 PROJECTS, DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS UNDER DISCRETIONARY REVIEW TO STREAMLINE

[Captioner] 20:01:13
 WITH THE CLIMATE ACTION PLAN AND DEMONSTRATE THEY ARE

[Captioner] 20:01:17
 MEETING THE GOALS OF THE CLIMATE ACTION PLAN AND THEREFORE THEY ARE

[Captioner] 20:01:21
 MEETING THEIR CEQA MITIGATION NEEDS.


[Captioner] 20:01:30
SO TONIGHT ADOPTION OF THE CLIMATE

[Captioner] 20:01:34
 READY FREMONT PLAN, THE COUNCIL WILL MAKE FINDINGS RELATED TO THE

[Captioner] 20:01:38
 THE ADDENDUM TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THE CLIMATE READY FREMONT PLAN DOES

[Captioner] 20:01:43
 NOT HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS BEYOND THE GENERAL

[Captioner] 20:01:47
 PLAN UPDATE EIR.
THERE'S A RESOLUTION IN THE

[Captioner] 20:01:52
 ADDENDUM AND THEN GIVING DIRECTION TO STAFF TO AGAIN IMPLEMENTATION OF CLIMATE READY FREMONT WITH A

[Captioner] 20:01:57
 FOCUS ON THE PRIORITY ACTIONS THAT ARE IDENTIFIED WITHIN THE GAME PLAN

[Captioner] 20:02:02
 IN CHAPTER 4.
WITH THAT, I WANTED TO OPEN IT UP

[Captioner] 20:02:06
 FOR COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS FROM COUNCIL AND

[Captioner] 20:02:10
 LET YOU KNOW HERE WITH ME IS OUR DEVELOPMENT

[Captioner] 20:02:14
 DIRECTOR DAN AND IN THE AUDIENCE WE HAVE HANS FROM

[Captioner] 20:02:18
 PUBLIC WORKS AS WELL AS JOEL FROM OUR PLANNING DIVISION

[Captioner] 20:02:23
 TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AND ON THE LINE WE HAVE HONEY WALTERS FROM

[Captioner] 20:02:27
 ASCENT ENVIRONMENTAL WHO CAN ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS REGARDING THE GHG

[Captioner] 20:02:31
 CALCULATIONS AND THE ADDENDUM TO THE

[Captioner] 20:02:35
 GENERAL PLAN EIR.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION ON

[Captioner] 20:02:39
 BEHALF OF THE ENTIRE COUNCIL AND AT THIS TIME, I'M GOING TO TURN IT OVER TO

[Captioner] 20:02:44
 THE COUNCIL FOR QUESTIONS FOR THE STAFF.
I SEE AT

[Captioner] 20:02:49
 THIS TIME COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN.
THIS IS FOR CLARIFYING QUESTIONS AND WE HAVE SOME PUBLIC

[Captioner] 20:02:53
 SPEAKERS TOO.
>> Councilmember Kassan: ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:02:59
SO MY BIGGEST QUESTION IS, I FEEL LIKE THERE'S NOT A LOT OF DISCUSSION

[Captioner] 20:03:03
 ON TIMING OF A LOT OF THE MEASURES EXCEPT FOR

[Captioner] 20:03:08
 THE SHORT TERM ACTIONS IN CHAPTER 4.
AND SO

[Captioner] 20:03:12
 I ASSUME THAT TO BE ABLE TO CALCULATE THE

[Captioner] 20:03:17
 POTENTIAL REDUCTION IN EMISSIONS FOR EACH ACTION, THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME

[Captioner] 20:03:21
 IDEA OF WHEN THEY WOULD BE IMPLEMENTED, BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, IF YOU DO

[Captioner] 20:03:25
 IT 10 YEARS FROM NOW VERSUS FIVE YEARS FROM NOW, THAT'S GOING TO AFFECT THE

[Captioner] 20:03:29
 TOTAL REDUCTION.
SO HOW DID YOU DEAL WITH THOSE

[Captioner] 20:03:34
 ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT TIMING FOR SOME OF THE THINGS THAT ARE NOT -- YOU KNOW, THERE'S NO

[Captioner] 20:03:38
 TIMELINE ASSOCIATED WITH THEM IN THE

[Captioner] 20:03:42
 PLAN, AND HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT THESE THINGS GET IMPLEMENTED IF THEY'RE NOT --

[Captioner] 20:03:46
 YOU KNOW, THERE'S REALLY NO TIMELINE ASSOCIATED WITH THEM?
>>

[Captioner] 20:03:51
 SO FOR ALL OF THE MEASURES THAT HAVE QUANTIFIED GREENHOUSE GAS

[Captioner] 20:03:55
 REDUCTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THEM, THERE ARE ASSUMPTIONS IN TERMS OF

[Captioner] 20:03:59
 HOW WE ARE GOING TO ACHIEVE THOSE EMISSION REDUCTIONS.
FOR

[Captioner] 20:04:03
 INSTANCE, WHEN WE LOOK AT

[Captioner] 20:04:08
 THE TRANSITION TO 100% CLEAN ENERGY, WE KNOW THAT

[Captioner] 20:04:12
 BY 2030, EAST BAY COMMUNITY ENERGY HAS ADOPTED A GOAL THAT

[Captioner] 20:04:16
 ALL OF THE ELECTRICITY THEY PROVIDE WILL BE 100% CLEAN.


[Captioner] 20:04:21
SO ADOPTION OF A RESOLUTION OR

[Captioner] 20:04:25
 AN ORDINANCE TO OPT UP -- IT WOULD BE A RESOLUTION TO OPT UP ALL

[Captioner] 20:04:29
 OF OUR RESIDENTS AND BUSINESSES TO THE RENEWABLE 100 RATE PLAN AHEAD OF

[Captioner] 20:04:34
 THAT SCHEDULE GETS US THOSE EMISSION REDUCTIONS SOONER.


[Captioner] 20:04:38
SO FOR EACH OF THOSE CALCULATIONS, WE DO HAVE

[Captioner] 20:04:42
 ASSUMPTIONS WITH DIFFERENT TIME LINES ASSOCIATED WITH THEM.
I WON'T BE ABLE TO GO THROUGH ALL OF 

[Captioner] 20:04:46
THEM RIGHT NOW.
IN TERMS OF IMPLEMENTATION, THE GAME

[Captioner] 20:04:50
 PLAN IS REALLY FOCUSED ON WHAT WE CAN DO

[Captioner] 20:04:54
 WITHIN THE FIRST THREE YEARS OF PLAN IMPLEMENTATION

[Captioner] 20:04:59
 BASED ON AN ANALYSIS OF WHAT WE

[Captioner] 20:05:03
 THINK, YOU KNOW, IS GOING TO ACHIEVE A GOOD AMOUNT OF EMISSION REDUCTIONS FROM THE QUANTIFICATIONS

[Captioner] 20:05:07
 THAT WE'VE ALREADY DONE, AS WELL AS THINGS THAT ALREADY

[Captioner] 20:05:11
 MIGHT BE UNDERWAY BASED ON OTHER -- ALIGNMENT WITH OTHER CITY

[Captioner] 20:05:16
 PLANS, THINGS THAT MAY BE FUNDED

[Captioner] 20:05:20
 THROUGH OUTSIDE FUNDING RESOURCES OR THE CITY CIP, SO WHAT CAN

[Captioner] 20:05:25
 WE DO AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, WHERE DO WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO MOVE THE NEEDLE

[Captioner] 20:05:29
 QUICKLY AND THEN REVISIT THAT GAME PLAN WITHIN THREE YEARS OR LESS IF WE HAVE DIRECTION FROM

[Captioner] 20:05:33
 COUNCIL TO DO SO, TO UPDATE THAT GAME PLAN AND LOOK AT

[Captioner] 20:05:37
 OTHER ACTIONS THAT WE MAY WANT TO FOCUS ON NEXT.


[Captioner] 20:05:41
>> Councilmember Kassan: IS IT POSSIBLE TO GET MORE TRANSPARENCY ON THE ASSUMPTIONS ON TIMELINE?


[Captioner] 20:05:46
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT THOSE ASSUMPTIONS ARE

[Captioner] 20:05:50
 SO THAT AS A COUNCIL, WE CAN BE PLANNING AHEAD, OH, YOU

[Captioner] 20:05:54
 KNOW, THIS THING REALLY IDEALLY NEEDS TO HAPPEN BY YEAR, YOU

[Captioner] 20:05:59
 KNOW, 2028 OR WHATEVER.
I FEEL LIKE THAT'S AN

[Captioner] 20:06:03
 IMPORTANT COMPONENT, AND IT MIGHT BE BURIED KIND OF IN THE APPENDICES, BUT

[Captioner] 20:06:07
 I DON'T FEEL LIKE THERE'S ANY CLARITY ON THOSE TIMING ASSUMPTIONS

[Captioner] 20:06:11
 THAT I SAW.
>> SO WE

[Captioner] 20:06:16
 CAN DO THAT AS A FOLLOW-UP, IF THAT'S SOMETHING OF INTEREST.


[Captioner] 20:06:21
I THINK THE FOCUS WITH THE GAME PLAN WAS TO LOOK

[Captioner] 20:06:25
 AT, YOU KNOW, KIND OF ALL OF THE DIFFERENT CRITERIA THAT ARE LISTED WITHIN

[Captioner] 20:06:30
 CHAPTER 4 AROUND, YOU KNOW, OUR ABILITY TO IMPLEMENT BASED ON ARE THERE OTHER CITIES THAT

[Captioner] 20:06:34
 HAVE DONE IT THAT WE CAN EASILY KIND OF PIGGY BACK OFF OF, IS THERE, YOU KNOW,

[Captioner] 20:06:39
 SUPPORTING POLICY OR REGIONAL RESOURCES TO SUPPORT US, ARE THERE, YOU KNOW,

[Captioner] 20:06:44
 FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE CAN LEVERAGE.
SO ALL OF THAT DID FACTOR

[Captioner] 20:06:48
 IN.
BUT IT WAS MORE OF A QUALITATIVE RATHER THAN A

[Captioner] 20:06:54
 QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS.
IN TERMS OF THE, YOU KNOW, STRICT EMISSION REDUCTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH

[Captioner] 20:06:59
 MEASURES, WE COULD, YOU KNOW, PROVIDE THAT IN A DIFFERENT

[Captioner] 20:07:04
 FORMAT IF THAT'S HELPFUL, BUT I THINK REALLY WITHIN THE PLAN, EACH MEASURE DOES

[Captioner] 20:07:08
 HAVE THAT PERCENTAGE REDUCTION ASSOCIATED WITH IT, AND THAT'S BASED ON

[Captioner] 20:07:13
 THE PERCENTAGE OF THE TOTAL 2030 EMISSION REDUCTIONS, SO

[Captioner] 20:07:17
 IT REALLY HELPS TO HIGHLIGHT WHICH MEASURES ARE GOING TO GET US TO

[Captioner] 20:07:22
 OUR 2030 GOAL IN A SUBSTANTIAL WAY, AND THEN THE ACTIONS WITHIN THOSE MEASURES

[Captioner] 20:07:26
 ARE THE PATHWAY FOR DOING THAT.
>> Councilmember Kassan: RIGHT, BUT I MEAN, IF WE DON'T KNOW --

[Captioner] 20:07:31
 YOU KNOW, WE HAVE A 2030 GOAL AND THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS THAT SHOULD HAPPEN

[Captioner] 20:07:36
 BEFORE 2030, WE NEED TO KNOW THAT SO THAT WE'RE NOT IN 2029 AND

[Captioner] 20:07:40
 SAYING, OOPS, WE FORGOT TO DO THESE THINGS.
SO I'M

[Captioner] 20:07:44
 JUST -- I'M JUST A LITTLE CONFUSED HOW WE WOULD

[Captioner] 20:07:48
 KNOW, YOU KNOW, A PLAN IS SUPPOSED TO TELL US NOT JUST WHAT WE SHOULD BE

[Captioner] 20:07:52
 DOING, BUT WHEN WE SHOULD BE DOING

[Captioner] 20:07:57
 IT, SO I'M JUST A LITTLE CONFUSED IF THAT'S NOT LAID OUT, HOW DOES THE LEADERSHIP OF

[Captioner] 20:08:01
 THE CITY KNOW WHAT THINGS NEED TO COME WHEN.
ESPECIALLY IF

[Captioner] 20:08:05
 THOSE -- THERE WERE TIMING ASSUMPTIONS BUILT INTO THE

[Captioner] 20:08:09
 CALCULATIONS OF THE EMISSION REDUCTIONS.
>> ONE OF THE

[Captioner] 20:08:15
 THINGS THAT WE HAVE LEARNED THROUGH IMPLEMENTATION OF THE FIRST CLIMATE ACTION

[Captioner] 20:08:20
 PLAN IS THAT THIS SPACE IS EVER-CHANGING, SO A NEW

[Captioner] 20:08:24
 POLICY AT THE STATE LEVEL, A NEW OPPORTUNITY AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL SUCH

[Captioner] 20:08:29
 AS INFLATION REDUCTION ACT CAN REALLY BE A GAME-CHANGING

[Captioner] 20:08:33
 MOMENT IN TIME WHERE ALL OF A SUDDEN,

[Captioner] 20:08:37
 SOMETHING WITHIN THE PLAN THAT WE THOUGHT WAS GOING TO BE A LONGER TERM

[Captioner] 20:08:42
 IMPLEMENTATION MEASURE CAN NOW BE FOCUSED ON IMMEDIATELY.
AND SO THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT

[Captioner] 20:08:46
 WE CAN CONTINUE TO BE NIMBLE ON, AND IN TERMS OF UPDATES

[Captioner] 20:08:51
 TO COUNCIL, IF THERE'S DIRECTION

[Captioner] 20:08:55
 TO UPDATE THE GAME PLAN ON A MORE REGULAR BASIS

[Captioner] 20:09:00
 THAN THREE YEARS, THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE CAN DO AT

[Captioner] 20:09:04
 A STAFF LEVEL.
AT THE SAME TIME, A LOT OF THE ACTIONS THAT WE'RE FOCUSED ON IN THE GAME PLAN

[Captioner] 20:09:08
 WILL TAKE MULTIPLE YEARS TO IMPLEMENT, SO SOME OF THE THINGS THAT I DIDN'T HIGHLIGHT IN THE PRESENTATION THAT

[Captioner] 20:09:12
 WE'RE CURRENTLY WORKING ON BUT WILL TAKE A FEW YEARS TO IMPLEMENT ARE IN PARTNERSHIP

[Captioner] 20:09:16
 WITH EAST BAY COMMUNITY ENERGY, YOU KNOW, WHERE WE'RE LOOKING

[Captioner] 20:09:21
 AT INSTALLING DIRECT CHARGING, FAST

[Captioner] 20:09:25
 CHARGING HUBS FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLES IN PUBLIC SPACES, AND WE'RE ALSO WORKING WITH

[Captioner] 20:09:29
 EBCE TO INSTALL SOLAR AND STORAGE ON A NUMBER OF OUR CITY

[Captioner] 20:09:33
 FACILITIES.
SO THOSE

[Captioner] 20:09:38
 ARE BIG MEASURES THAT CAN HAVE SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS, BUT THEY WILL TAKE

[Captioner] 20:09:42
 A COUPLE YEARS TO IMPLEMENT.
>> Councilmember Kassan: I THINK THAT DOES

[Captioner] 20:09:46
 MAKE A LOT OF SENSE.
OBVIOUSLY WE DON'T -- IT'S HARD TO PLAN THINGS THAT FAR

[Captioner] 20:09:50
 IN ADVANCE BUT YOU KNOW, IT JUST CONCERNS ME THAT THERE

[Captioner] 20:09:54
 WERE ASSUMPTIONS MADE ABOUT TIMING SO I WOULD LOVE FOR THOSE TO BE MORE

[Captioner] 20:09:58
 TRANSPARENT.
THE OTHER QUESTION I HAVE IS ABOUT THE USE OF THE WORD ENCOURAGE.


[Captioner] 20:10:03
THAT IS USED QUITE A BIT IN THE PLAN, AND I FEEL LIKE THAT'S

[Captioner] 20:10:07
 VERY VAGUE.
WE WANT TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO SWITCH FROM

[Captioner] 20:10:12
 GAS POWERED LEAF BLOWERS TO ELECTRIC LEAF BLOWERS, YOU KNOW, WHAT

[Captioner] 20:10:16
 DOES THAT MEAN EXACTLY?
YOU KNOW, IN THE CASE OF

[Captioner] 20:10:20
 THAT, I KNOW THAT THERE IS SOME STATE LEGISLATION THAT WILL ADDRESS

[Captioner] 20:10:24
 THAT, BUT YOU KNOW, THE WORD ENCOURAGE KIND OF CONCERNS ME ALSO BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE

[Captioner] 20:10:28
 IT'S QUITE VAGUE.
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN, YOU KNOW, WHAT ACTION DO WE TAKE

[Captioner] 20:10:32
 TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO DO SOMETHING.
>>

[Captioner] 20:10:39
 YEAH, THERE ARE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT ACTION VERBS THAT WE'VE USED FOR VARIOUS

[Captioner] 20:10:45
 ACTIONS DEPENDING ON THE LEVEL BASED

[Captioner] 20:10:49
 ON CONVERSATIONS WITHIN STAFF AND WITH THE PUBLIC

[Captioner] 20:10:54
 SEEMED MOST APPROPRIATE FOR THAT EXAMPLE, LIKE YOU SAID,

[Captioner] 20:10:58
 THERE IS A STATE LAW THAT WILL PROHIBIT THE

[Captioner] 20:11:02
 SALE OF NEW GAS POWERED LANDSCAPING EQUIPMENT

[Captioner] 20:11:07
 AFTER 2024 IN TERMS OF EXISTING EQUIPMENT BEING USED, YOU KNOW, WE CAN

[Captioner] 20:11:11
 PROVIDE INCENTIVES, IF THERE ARE ANY AVAILABLE REGIONALLY, WE

[Captioner] 20:11:15
 CAN PROVIDE INFORMATION AROUND RESOURCES THAT ARE

[Captioner] 20:11:21
 OUT THERE TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO MAKE THAT TRANSITION.
SO ENCOURAGE CAN INVOLVE A LOT OF

[Captioner] 20:11:25
 DIFFERENT THINGS AND I UNDERSTAND, YOU KNOW, THERE CAN

[Captioner] 20:11:29
 BE

[Captioner] 20:11:34
 VAGUARITY BEHIND IT FOR A REASON.
>> Councilmember Kassan: OKAY, THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:11:38
>> Mayor Mei: NEXT FOR CLARIFYING QUESTIONS IS COUNCILMEMBER KENG.
>> Councilmember Keng: THANK

[Captioner] 20:11:43
 YOU, MADAME MAYOR, AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE STAFF TEAM FOR YOUR IMPORTANT WORK

[Captioner] 20:11:47
 ON THIS MATTER.
I JUST HAVE A QUICK QUESTION.
HOW ARE WE LOOKING

[Captioner] 20:11:51
 FUNDING-WISE, AND IF WE ARE LOOKING AT ANY GRANT

[Captioner] 20:11:56
 FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE'RE LOOKING TO PURSUE?
>> WELL,

[Captioner] 20:12:00
 CURRENTLY FOR SOME OF THE CITY OPERATIONAL ACTIONS, WE DO

[Captioner] 20:12:04
 HAVE SOME CIP FUNDING TO SUPPORT THAT WORK WHEN IT COMES TO FLEET

[Captioner] 20:12:08
 ELECTRIFICATION AND ALSO EXISTING BUILDING ELECTRIFICATION.


[Captioner] 20:12:12
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF INCENTIVE PROGRAMS OUT THERE

[Captioner] 20:12:18
 TO SUPPORT EXISTING RESIDENTS AND BUSINESSES TO TAKE ACTION, ESPECIALLY COMING

[Captioner] 20:12:22
 OUT OF THE INFLATION

[Captioner] 20:12:27
 REDUCTION ACT, A LOT OF TAX CREDIT AND INCENTIVES AS WELL.
WE'RE ALSO LOOKING

[Captioner] 20:12:31
 AT VARIOUS OPPORTUNITIES THAT MIGHT BE AVAILABLE TO THE CITY EITHER TO APPLY FOR DIRECTLY OR

[Captioner] 20:12:35
 IN PARTNERSHIP WITH OTHER REGIONAL AGENCIES FOR FUNDING TO SUPPORT CLIMATE

[Captioner] 20:12:39
 ACTION IMPLEMENTATION.
FOR EXAMPLE, CURRENTLY

[Captioner] 20:12:43
 THE BAY AREA AIR QUALITY DISTRICT IS GOING AFTER FUNDING FROM THE

[Captioner] 20:12:47
 EPA FOR CLIMATE ACTION IMPLEMENTATION AND THEY HAVE BEEN ENGAGING

[Captioner] 20:12:53
 CITY STAFF AROUND THE BAY AREA INCLUDING THE CITY OF FREMONT

[Captioner] 20:12:57
 ON MEASURES THAT WE'RE INTERESTED IN SEEING IMPLEMENTED IN OUR COMMUNITY IN

[Captioner] 20:13:01
 WAYS THAT THAT FUNDING PROVIDED AT THE REGIONAL LEVEL COULD SUPPORT OUR CLIMATE

[Captioner] 20:13:05
 ACTION IMPLEMENTATION EFFORTS.


[Captioner] 20:14:50
 THOROUGH, SO I THINK IT'S GREAT WE'RE CONTINUING WITH THAT THEME.
IT'S A GREAT GENERAL PLAN, EVERYBODY 

[Captioner] 20:14:54
SHOULD READ IT.
REQUIRED READING.


[Captioner] 20:15:00
SO I GUESS ONE THING THAT WAS TROUBLING WAS 2030

[Captioner] 20:15:04
 SEEMED LIKE WE'RE DOING GREAT, BUT 2040, THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT

[Captioner] 20:15:09
 GAP SO HOW DO WE GET THERE IN 2040?
>> THANK

[Captioner] 20:15:13
 YOU FOR THE QUESTION.
SO YOU KNOW, AGAIN, THE

[Captioner] 20:15:17
 ASSUMPTIONS FOR OUR EMISSION REDUCTIONS, THE BASIS FOR IT

[Captioner] 20:15:21
 IS LOOKING AT WHAT'S CURRENTLY ADOPTED BY

[Captioner] 20:15:26
 THE STATE, WHAT'S ENACTED AT THE STATE LEVEL FOR CLIMATE

[Captioner] 20:15:30
 POLICY, AND WE LOOK AT THE EMISSION REDUCTIONS THAT THOSE

[Captioner] 20:15:35
 ACTIONS HAVE, AND THEN WE LOOK AT WHAT CAN WE DO AT THE LOCAL LEVEL TO

[Captioner] 20:15:39
 REDUCE EMISSIONS FURTHER.
SO ALL THE MEASURES WITHIN CLIMATE READY FREMONT ARE

[Captioner] 20:15:44
 REDUCING EMISSIONS FURTHER FROM CURRENTLY ADOPTED STATE

[Captioner] 20:15:49
 POLICY.
WE KNOW THAT THERE WILL BE NEW

[Captioner] 20:15:54
 CLIMATE FOCUSED STATE POLICIES MOVING FORWARD.
THOSE CAN REDUCE EMISSIONS FURTHER.


[Captioner] 20:15:58
WE ALSO KNOW THAT THERE WILL BE ADVANCEMENTS IN TECHNOLOGY THAT MAY

[Captioner] 20:16:02
 BE ABLE TO TAKE US

[Captioner] 20:16:07
 TO THE NEXT LEVEL IN TERMS OF GREENHOUSE GAS

[Captioner] 20:16:10
 EMISSION REDUCTIONS AND THERE CAN BE POSSIBILITIES THAT WE'RE NOT EVEN AWARE OF OR THINKING OF YET.


[Captioner] 20:16:14
FOR INSTANCE, WITH THE FIR CLIMATE ACTION PLAN, WE DIDN'T ANTICIPATE

[Captioner] 20:16:18
 THE ROLLOUT OF COMMUNITY CHOICE ENERGY.
ONCE WE JOINED EAST BAY COMMUNITY

[Captioner] 20:16:23
 ENERGY, BECAUSE WE HAD A CLEANER ELECTRICITY PRODUCT, THAT REDUCED OUR COMMUNITY-WIDE

[Captioner] 20:16:27
 EMISSIONS BY 10%.
SO THOSE ARE, YOU KNOW, THINGS

[Captioner] 20:16:32
 THAT MAY COME UP DURING IMPLEMENTATION OF

[Captioner] 20:16:36
 CLIMATE READY FREMONT BEFORE 2030 THAT CAN HAVE AN IMPACT ON OUR LONGER

[Captioner] 20:16:40
 TERM EMISSION TRAJECTORY THAT WE'RE NOT YET AWARE OF, AND WHEN

[Captioner] 20:16:44
 WE LOOK AT WHAT'S TO COME AFTER 2030, WE'LL BE LOOKING AT

[Captioner] 20:16:49
 ACTIONS THAT GO DEEPER OR MORE WIDESPREAD THAN WHAT WE'VE BEEN

[Captioner] 20:16:53
 ABLE TO DO SO FAR, AND THE GOAL IS

[Captioner] 20:16:58
 THEN TO MEET OUR 2045 CARBON NEUTRALITY

[Captioner] 20:17:01
 TARGET.
OR SOONER.
>> Councilmember Salwan: GOT IT.


[Captioner] 20:17:06
SO PART OF THE CONCEPT IS PREPARING FOR LUCK OR CHANCES THAT COME UP AND BE

[Captioner] 20:17:10
 OPPORTUNISTIC TO SEIZE THEM AT THAT TIME.
>> YEAH, AND JUST TO ADD TO THAT, IN

[Captioner] 20:17:14
 THE FIRST CLIMATE ACTION PLAN, WE HAD A GAP.
WE DIDN'T KNOW HOW WE

[Captioner] 20:17:18
 WERE GOING TO ACTUALLY ACHIEVE THE 25% REDUCTION GOAL.
WE

[Captioner] 20:17:22
 KNEW WITH LOCAL ACTIONS THAT WE WOULD ACHIEVE ABOUT A 15%

[Captioner] 20:17:28
 REDUCTION.
JOINING EAST BAY COMMUNITY ENERGY GOT US THAT ADDITIONAL 10%.


[Captioner] 20:17:32
>> Councilmember Salwan: OKAY.
SO SPEAKING OF COMMUNITY ENERGY, I THOUGHT

[Captioner] 20:17:36
 WE ALREADY WENT TO 100%.
ISN'T THAT ALREADY THE CASE?
>> WE HAVE FOR CITY

[Captioner] 20:17:40
 OPERATIONS.
>> Councilmember Salwan: OH, OKAY.
>> SO WE'RE LOOKING AT SETTING AS A

[Captioner] 20:17:44
 DEFAULT RENEWABLE 100 FOR RESIDENTS AND BUSINESSES AS WELL.
>> Councilmember Salwan:

[Captioner] 20:17:48
 AND WHEN WOULD THAT START?
>> SO I WAS LOOKING AT THE TIMELINES WITH THE STAFF

[Captioner] 20:17:53
 FROM EBCE, AND THE GOAL

[Captioner] 20:17:57
 WOULD BE TO

[Captioner] 20:18:01
 TARGET A RESOLUTION WE BRING TO CITY COUNCIL IN THE

[Captioner] 20:18:06
 SPRINGTIME, BECAUSE EBCE SAYS WE NEED TO HAVE BOARD APPROVAL BY

[Captioner] 20:18:10
 APRIL 30TH OF 2024 IN ORDER TO HAVE IMPLEMENTATION

[Captioner] 20:18:14
 ROLLING OUT AT THE END OF OCTOBER 2024.
THEY HAVE TWO

[Captioner] 20:18:19
 ENROLLMENT WINDOWS EVERY YEAR, SO SIX-MONTH PERIOD.
IF WE MISS THAT,

[Captioner] 20:18:23
 SPRINGTIME ENROLLMENT, THEN WE'D HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL FALL WHICH

[Captioner] 20:18:28
 WOULD THEN PUSH OUT ACTUAL MOVING OF PEOPLE ON TO THE NEW RATE

[Captioner] 20:18:32
 PLAN INTO EARLY 2025.
>> Councilmember Salwan: GOT

[Captioner] 20:18:36
 IT.
THEN THE LAST THING ABOUT THE CEQA STREAMLINING, IS

[Captioner] 20:18:40
 THERE CRITERIA THAT THEY CHECK CERTAIN THINGS OR HOW DOES THAT

[Captioner] 20:18:45
 WORK?
>> RIGHT, SO AT THE STAFF LEVEL, WE WILL HAVE A

[Captioner] 20:18:49
 CHECKLIST.
WE'RE PREPARING THAT CURRENTLY WITH OUR CONSULTANT, AND IT ALIGNS WITH

[Captioner] 20:18:54
 THE MEASURES WITHIN CLIMATE-READY FREMONT, SO THAT CHECKLIST WOULD

[Captioner] 20:18:59
 THEN BE SOMETHING AT THE PROJECT LEVEL THE DEVELOPER COULD FILL OUT

[Captioner] 20:19:03
 AND SAY OKAY, WE'RE DOING THESE THINGS THAT ALIGN WITH CLIMATE-READY FREMONT

[Captioner] 20:19:07
 AND THAT WOULD BE

[Captioner] 20:19:11
 PROVIDED AS THEY GO THROUGH THE APPROVAL PROCESS.
>> Councilmember Salwan: SO IT WOULD 

[Captioner] 20:19:15
KIND OF LIKE BE AN INCENTIVE TO MAKE THE PROJECT PROCEED FASTER?
>>

[Captioner] 20:19:20
 RIGHT.
DAN?
>> Mr. Schoenholz: I THINK IN MOST

[Captioner] 20:19:24
 CASES, THEY'LL WANT TO USE OUR CHECKLIST AND DO WHAT IT TAKES TO BE CONSISTENT WITH OUR PLAN.


[Captioner] 20:19:29
OTHERWISE THEY HAVE TO DO A SEPARATE CEQA GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS ANALYSIS,

[Captioner] 20:19:33
 AND THAT WILL BE COSTLY AND TAKE LONGER

[Captioner] 20:19:37
 AND HAVE AN UNCERTAIN OUTCOME.
>> Councilmember Salwan: EXCELLENT.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:19:41
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
I JUST WANTED TO NOTE REAL QUICKLY, WE HAVE

[Captioner] 20:19:45
 ALSO COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL, BUT WE ARE GOING TO BE TAKING A BREAK

[Captioner] 20:19:49
 AT 8:30 FOR OUR STENOCAPTIONER.
SO COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL, QUESTIONS?


[Captioner] 20:19:55
>> Councilmember Campbell: WELL, THANK YOU FOR THIS CLIMATE ACTION PLAN.


[Captioner] 20:19:59
IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S GOTTEN A LOT OF TRACTION.
WE'VE GO TON SOME

[Captioner] 20:20:03
 GOTTEN SOME REALLY WONDERFUL NOTES FROM THE SCHOOL DISTRICT, WATER

[Captioner] 20:20:08
 DISTRICT, EAST BAY ENERGY, LOTS OF WONDERFUL COMMENTS AND SUPPORT OF THIS

[Captioner] 20:20:12
 GREAT PRODUCT THAT YOU'VE DONE.
I'VE DUG A LITTLE DEEPER INTO

[Captioner] 20:20:18
 IT AND DAN, I THINK I SENT -- I KNOW I DID, I SENT

[Captioner] 20:20:22
 YOU A

[Captioner] 20:20:27
 SCORECARD I RECEIVED FROM THE BERKELEY FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM THAT WAS ACTUALLY

[Captioner] 20:20:32
 LOOKING AT OUR SURROUNDING CITIES AND DETERMINING WHERE WE SCORED ON THIS.
IT'S

[Captioner] 20:20:36
 THE CLIMATE EMERGENCY MOBILIZATION TASK FORCE

[Captioner] 20:20:40
 THAT HAD DONE

[Captioner] 20:20:45
 THIS.
OUR SCORE CAME BACK A LITTLE LOW ON SOME OF THE

[Captioner] 20:20:49
 AREAS THAT AT LEAST THIS

[Captioner] 20:20:53
 GROUP HAD BEEN INVESTIGATING AND HAD BEEN LOOKING AT, AND

[Captioner] 20:20:57
 YOU GAVE ME SOME GREAT INFORMATION THAT I THINK MAYBE WE SHOULD SHARE

[Captioner] 20:21:01
 WHILE WE'RE CELEBRATING AND I GUESS THAT WOULD BE A

[Captioner] 20:21:04
 QUESTION.
I NEED TO ASK A QUESTION AND NOT MAKE A STATEMENT SO THE QUESTION IS, HOW DO 

[Captioner] 20:21:10
YOU THINK WE FARED ON THE

[Captioner] 20:21:13
 SCORECARD?
>> Mr. Schoenholz: THIS IS LIKE JEOPARDY, YOU HAVE TO PUT IT IN A 

[Captioner] 20:21:17
QUESTION FORM.
SO COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL HAD FORWARDED A SCORECARD THAT WAS

[Captioner] 20:21:23
 DONE BY A STUDENT GROUP ON BEHALF OF THE NON-PROFIT, I THINK.
THAT WE WEREN'T

[Captioner] 20:21:27
 FAMILIAR WITH.
IT RATED ALL THE CITIES

[Captioner] 20:21:32
 IN ALAMEDA COUNTY, WE CAME OUT PROBABLY LOWER MIDDLE IN TERMS

[Captioner] 20:21:36
 OF OUR SCORE.
ONE OF

[Captioner] 20:21:40
 MY COMMENTS BACK TO COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL IS THAT ASSUMING COUNCIL ADOPTS THE PLAN TONIGHT WE CAN GO

[Captioner] 20:21:44
 BACK TOMORROW AND OUR SCORE WILL INCREASE DRAMATICALLY BECAUSE PART OF WHAT THEY WERE LOOKING AT WAS

[Captioner] 20:21:48
 HOW OLD OUR PLAN WAS AND SOME OF THE LANGUAGE IN OUR

[Captioner] 20:21:53
 PLAN AND THEY WERE LOOKING AT THE 2012 PLAN SO

[Captioner] 20:21:57
 THAT'S ONE COMPONENT.
ANOTHER IS THEY PICKED SOME SORT OF RANDOM CRITERIA

[Captioner] 20:22:01
 THAT WERE SORT OF IN MY MIND TANGENTIALLY

[Captioner] 20:22:07
 RELATED TO THE QUALITY OF OUR PLAN BUT WE CAN ALSO TALK TO THEM

[Captioner] 20:22:10
 ABOUT THAT AND GIVE THEM SOME SUGGESTIONS.
ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS I POINTED OUT 

[Captioner] 20:22:14
TO COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL IS THAT ON OTHER SCORE CARDS,

[Captioner] 20:22:18
 FREMONT HAS RATED EXTREMELY HIGH, WE WERE

[Captioner] 20:22:23
 RATED THE NINTH GREENEST CITY IN THE WHOLE

[Captioner] 20:22:27
 COUNTRY.
WHAT WAS THE OTHER ONE?
>> THE INSTITUTE

[Captioner] 20:22:31
 FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT BEACON AWARD.


[Captioner] 20:22:36
BACK IN 2016 OR 2017 WE RECEIVED THE SILVER LEVEL BEACON AWARD FROM

[Captioner] 20:22:40
 THE ILG AND IN 2021, WE

[Captioner] 20:22:44
 ACTUALLY RE-APPLIED IN

[Captioner] 20:22:48
 TERMS OF REDUCTIONS AND ENERGY SAVINGS BOTH WITHIN

[Captioner] 20:22:52
 OUR CITY OPERATIONS AND OUR CLIMATE ACTION BEST PRACTICES AND WE RECEIVED

[Captioner] 20:22:56
 A PLATINUM LEVEL AWARD FROM THE ILG WHICH WE'RE STILL ONE OF A

[Captioner] 20:23:01
 HANDFUL OF CITIES WITH THAT RANKING.


[Captioner] 20:23:07
>> Councilmember Campbell: THAT'S ACTUALLY VERY WONDERFUL IN TERMS OF ANSWERING THAT QUESTION.


[Captioner] 20:23:11
SO IN TERMS OF THAT SCORECARD, I NOTICED THERE WERE SEVERAL OF OUR SURROUNDING CITIES.


[Captioner] 20:23:16
DUBLIN, NEWARK AND FREMONT.
WE ALL SCORED THE SAME

[Captioner] 20:23:20
 IN THAT.
SO MY QUESTION IS, DOES THE SURROUNDING

[Captioner] 20:23:23
 CITIES' CLIMATE READINESS HAVE AN IMPACT ON US, SINCE WE'RE SO CLOSE TOGETHER?


[Captioner] 20:23:31
>> THAT'S AN INTERESTING QUESTION.
I THINK, YOU

[Captioner] 20:23:37
 KNOW, I'LL RESPOND IN A WAY THAT HOPEFULLY IS HELPFUL.
SO WHEN WE LOOK AT OUR

[Captioner] 20:23:42
 EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS THAT WE CAN ACHIEVE LOCALLY, WE'RE REALLY FOCUSED ON WHAT IS HAPPENING WITHIN

[Captioner] 20:23:46
 OUR BORDERS THAT WE HAVE LOCAL CONTROL OVER THAT

[Captioner] 20:23:51
 WE CAN ADOPT NEW POLICIES THAT WE CAN IMPLEMENT PROJECTS, THAT WE

[Captioner] 20:23:55
 CAN PARTNER WITH OTHER AGENCIES FOR

[Captioner] 20:24:00
 IMPLEMENTATION.
ALAMEDA COUNTY HAS BEEN AT THE FOREFRONT OF CLIMATE ACTION FOR

[Captioner] 20:24:04
 A LONG TIME.
WE WERE THE FIRST COUNTY TO HAVE EVERY CITY ADOPT A CLIMATE ACTION PLAN

[Captioner] 20:24:08
 WITH THE SUPPORT OF STOPWASTE YEARS AGO.


[Captioner] 20:24:14
ALAMEDA COUNTY ACTUALLY HAS ONE OF THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF POPULATION THAT BELIEVE IN THE SCIENCE OF CLIMATE 

[Captioner] 20:24:18
CHANGE AND THAT WE SHOULD DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.


[Captioner] 20:24:23
SO IN TERMS OF THE REGIONAL COOPERATION FOR CLIMATE ACTION PLAN

[Captioner] 20:24:27
 IMPLEMENTATION, IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT AND IT'S INTEGRAL TO THE WORK THAT I

[Captioner] 20:24:31
 DO, BECAUSE MOST OF THE STAFF WITHIN THE CITIES IN ALAMEDA

[Captioner] 20:24:35
 COUNTY THAT WORK ON CLIMATE ARE, YOU KNOW, A TEAM OF A FEW PEOPLE AT

[Captioner] 20:24:39
 MOST.
SO WE REALLY RELY ON EACH OTHER FOR LEARNING BEST

[Captioner] 20:24:44
 PRACTICES, SUPPORTING THINGS THAT MAY BE MORE REGIONAL IN

[Captioner] 20:24:48
 IMPLEMENTATION THAT CROSS OUR BORDERS.
SO YOU KNOW, THERE'S

[Captioner] 20:24:52
 THE LOCAL SIDE TO IT AND THERE'S DEFINITELY THE REGIONAL SIDE TO IT.


[Captioner] 20:24:56
>> Councilmember Campbell: WONDERFUL.
THANK YOU FOR THAT.
THE OTHER QUESTION I HAVE, I HAVE TWO 

[Captioner] 20:25:01
OTHER QUESTIONS.
ONE IS, WHERE IS THE CARBON

[Captioner] 20:25:05
 STORED WHEN IT'S SEQUESTERED?
I MEAN, I COULDN'T

[Captioner] 20:25:09
 FIND THAT IN THE PLAN, SO I MEAN -- BECAUSE THAT'S OUR

[Captioner] 20:25:14
 ULTIMATE GOAL, IS TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT, BUT WHERE DOES IT

[Captioner] 20:25:18
 GO ONCE IT'S SEQUESTERED?
>> SO WHAT WE'RE FOCUSED ON

[Captioner] 20:25:23
 WITH CARBON SEQUESTRATION IN OUR CLIMATE ACTION PLAN ARE BIOLOGICAL WAYS OF

[Captioner] 20:25:28
 SEQUESTERING CARBON.
SO THAT'S LITERALLY DRAWING DOWN THE CARBON

[Captioner] 20:25:32
 DIOXIDE FROM THE ATMOSPHERE AND TURNING IT

[Captioner] 20:25:37
 INTO CARBON IN THE FORM OF TREE GROWTH OR

[Captioner] 20:25:42
 VEGETATIVE GROWTH, AND THEN ALSO WE CAN DRAW DOWN

[Captioner] 20:25:47
 CARBON DIOXIDE INTO THE SOIL WHEN WE APPLY COMPOST AND

[Captioner] 20:25:51
 MULCH, THE MICROORGANISMS WITHIN THAT TAKE IN THE CARBON

[Captioner] 20:25:55
 DIOXIDE.
SO THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENT WAYS TO SEQUESTER CARBON

[Captioner] 20:25:59
 THAT WE'RE NOT ADDRESSING IN OUR CLIMATE ACTION PLAN.


[Captioner] 20:26:03
TECHNOLOGICAL WAYS OF DOING THAT THROUGH CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE, THAT'S BEYOND WHAT WE

[Captioner] 20:26:07
 CAN DO AT THE LOCAL LEVEL.
BUT WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE

[Captioner] 20:26:12
 IS PLANTING TREES.
AS THOSE TREES GROW, THEY TAKE IN

[Captioner] 20:26:16
 CARBON DIOXIDE AND TURN THAT

[Captioner] 20:26:20
 INTO CARBON IN TERMS OF THEIR TRUNKS, THEIR BRANCHES, THEIR LEAVESMENT
>> Councilmember

[Captioner] 20:26:24
 Campbell: OKAY.
I DID SEE A LOT OF THAT IN THE PLAN.

[Captioner] 20:26:29
 WITH THAT.
AND THEN MY FINAL QUESTION

[Captioner] 20:26:34
 IS, THIS -- WELL, ACTUALLY I WAS THINKING ABOUT PG&E AND THEIR ABILITY TO BE ABLE

[Captioner] 20:26:39
 TO HANDLE EVERYTHING THAT WE'RE ASKING FOR IN OUR PLAN, BUT THE

[Captioner] 20:26:43
 GRAY WATER PIECE WAS VERY INTERESTING TO ME.
SO I WOULD LIKE

[Captioner] 20:26:48
 TO KNOW, HOW ARE WE GOING TO -- WHAT IS THE

[Captioner] 20:26:52
 PROCESS OF 5% OF HOUSEHOLDS WILL RE-USE THEIR GRAY

[Captioner] 20:26:57
 WATER IN

[Captioner] 20:27:01
 2030?
HOW DO WE PLAN TO GET THERE?
>> SO

[Captioner] 20:27:06
 GRAY WATER IS AN INTERESTING TOPIC

[Captioner] 20:27:11
 AND ONE THAT ONE OF OUR COMMISSIONERS, OUR STUDENT COMMISSIONER IS VERY WELL VERSED IN,

[Captioner] 20:27:15
 SO THIS IS HER SWEET SPOT.
WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT WHEN WE'RE

[Captioner] 20:27:19
 TALKING ABOUT GRAY WATER IS BEING ABLE TO RE-USE

[Captioner] 20:27:24
 THE WATER THAT IS USED IN HOMES FOR, YOU

[Captioner] 20:27:28
 KNOW, WASHING OUR HANDS, FOR WASHING OUR LAUNDRY, IF

[Captioner] 20:27:32
 THAT WATER IS NOT CONTAMINATED, IT CAN BE

[Captioner] 20:27:37
 RE-USED FOR THE PURPOSE OF WATERING LANDSCAPES.
AND SO THERE'S A

[Captioner] 20:27:42
 LOT OF BEST PRACTICES FOR GRAY WATER IN TERMS OF WHAT TYPE OF SOAPS ARE

[Captioner] 20:27:46
 APPROPRIATE TO USE FOR LAUNDRY, WHERE YOU CAN DO A LAUNDRY

[Captioner] 20:27:51
 TO LANDSCAPE SYSTEM WHERE YOU DIVERT THE RINSE CYCLE OF YOUR LAUNDRY INTO YOUR

[Captioner] 20:27:55
 LANDSCAPE.
THE WATER DISTRICT HAS A LOT OF INTEREST IN MAKING SURE

[Captioner] 20:27:59
 THAT THESE TYPES OF SYSTEMS ARE DESIGNED PROPERLY TO ENSURE THAT

[Captioner] 20:28:03
 WE'RE PRESERVING THE QUALITY OF THE GROUNDWATER.


[Captioner] 20:28:07
AND SO THERE ARE EFFORTS THAT HAVE BEEN DONE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL

[Captioner] 20:28:12
 TO EDUCATE RESIDENTS IN EXISTING SINGLE-FAMILY HOMES ON HOW TO INSTALL

[Captioner] 20:28:17
 GRAY WATER SYSTEMS.
TRI-CITY ECOLOGY CENTER HAS DONE SOME DEMONSTRATIONS

[Captioner] 20:28:21
 OF THAT.


[Captioner] 20:28:25
AND THE GRAY WATER

[Captioner] 20:28:29
 ACTION ORGANIZATION HAS PROVIDED A LOT OF INFORMATION TO OUR RESIDENTS AS WELL AS

[Captioner] 20:28:33
 RESIDENTS BEYOND THE BORDERS OF FREMONT ON THE BENEFITS OF GRAY WATER USE.


[Captioner] 20:28:37
>> Councilmember Campbell: THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THIS.
GREAT JOB.


[Captioner] 20:28:41
>> THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
SO WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A 10-MINUTE 

[Captioner] 20:28:45
BREAK AND WE'LL RETURN WITH COUNCILMEMBER COX'S QUESTIONS.
AND THEN I ALSO KNOW

[Captioner] 20:28:49
 WE HAVE NINE OR 10 PUBLIC SPEAKERS AT LEAST.


[Captioner] 20:28:54
VICE MAYOR.
OKAY.
BUT SO WE'LL RETURN AFTER THE 

[Captioner] 20:28:58
10-MINUTE BREAK.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:29:59
[ RECESS ]

[Captioner] 20:42:25

>> The Clerk:   ASK WE COME

[Captioner] 20:42:29
CAN WE COME BACK 
TO THE DAIS

[Captioner] 20:42:32
 PLEASE, 
COUNCILMEMBERS BACK TO THE DAIS 
PLEASE.


[Captioner] 20:42:43
>> Mayor Mei:   WELCOME BACK.


[Captioner] 20:42:52
AND I SEE WE ALSO HAVE QUITE A 
FEW PEOPLE WHO ARE SPEAKING ON 
THE

[Captioner] 20:42:57
 ITEM AFTERWARDS BUT VICE 
MAYOR COX IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO 
START

[Captioner] 20:43:01
 WITH YOUR QUESTIONS.
THANKS FOR YOUR QUESTIONS.


[Captioner] 20:43:06
>> Vice Mayor Cox:   THANK YOU 
VERY MUCH.
I REALLY APPRECIATE ALL THE HARD 


[Captioner] 20:43:10
WORK THAT'S GONE IN ON THE TEAM 
FOR SUSTAINABILITY IN

[Captioner] 20:43:14
 OUR 
CLIMATE ACTION PLAN AND I 
APPRECIATE ALLOWING US 


[Captioner] 20:43:18
OPPORTUNITY TO ASK QUESTIONS.
YOU KNOW ONE OF THE BIG THINGS 
AS YOU CARRY OUT THE CLIMATE

[Captioner] 20:43:23
 
ACTION PLAN IS HOW STRONG IS OUR 
PURCHASE

[Captioner] 20:43:27
ING PROCUREMENT 
DEPARTMENT?
BECAUSE A LOT OF THESE ACTIONS 


[Captioner] 20:43:31
THAT YOU'RE TAKING ARE GOING TO 
REQUIRE A LOT OF COMPETITIVE 
SOLICITATIONS

[Captioner] 20:43:36
, NEGOTIATIONS,

[Captioner] 20:43:40
 AND 
SOME OF THOSE THINGS COULD TAKE 
TWO YEARS OUT JUST TO COMPLETE 


[Captioner] 20:43:44
THOSE.
MAYBE YOU HAVE HAD SOME OF THOSE 
COMPLETED AN YOUR PHASING THEM 


[Captioner] 20:43:48
IN NOW BUT IF YOU COULD ADDRESS 
MY QUESTION IN TERMS OF 
UNDERSTAND

[Captioner] 20:43:53
ING ALSO DE F

[Captioner] 20:43:57
ALCO, BUT 
ALSO IN PROCUREMENT AS WELL IN

[Captioner] 20:44:01
 
DOING THAT ASPECT BUT JUST 
TRYING TO UNDERSTAND YOUR TEAM 


[Captioner] 20:44:05
YOUR STAFF TO IMPLEMENT THIS 
CLIMATE ACTION PLAN THAT WOULD 
BE MOST HELPFUL IN

[Captioner] 20:44:08
 UNDERSTANDING 
THIS PIECE.
>> SO I SAID IN COMMUNITY 


[Captioner] 20:44:14
 -- I 
SIT IN COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT AS 
WE WORK ON CONTRACTS WE

[Captioner] 20:44:18
 HAVE TO 
WORK ON PROCUREMENT WITH 
PURCHASING PRETTY SIGNIFICANTLY.


[Captioner] 20:44:22
SO WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT 
PROJECTS THAT WE'RE DOING 
DIRECTLY TO

[Captioner] 20:44:28
 IMPLEMENT

[Captioner] 20:44:34
 TO CITY 
OPERATIONS THOSE ARE THINGS THAT 
ARE GOING TO BE CLEAN ENERGY 


[Captioner] 20:44:39
PROJECTS OR BATTERY BACKUPS, EV  
CHARGING FOR

[Captioner] 20:44:43
 OUR FLEET.
I THINK WHERE WE LOOK AT KIND

[Captioner] 20:44:47
 OF 
THE OPPORTUNITIES AROUND 
PURCHASING MORE HOLISTICALLY

[Captioner] 20:44:51
 ARE 
HOW ARE WE INTEGRATING IN SOME 
OF THE GOALS AROUND CLEAN

[Captioner] 20:44:55
ER 
PRODUCTS, LOW CARBON PRODUCTS 
INTO MORE STANDARD DECISION 


[Captioner] 20:45:00
MAKING.
YOU KNOW, SO FOR INSTANCE,

[Captioner] 20:45:09
 
UTILIZING

[Captioner] 20:45:13
 LOWER PAVING MATERIALS 
IN OUR STREET.
THOSE ARE THINGS THAT

[Captioner] 20:45:18
 WE 
INCLUDED IN THE CLIMATE PLAN  
GREEN

[Captioner] 20:45:22
 AND CIRCULAR PURCHASING, 
GREEN PURCHASING

[Captioner] 20:45:26
 AS A STRATEGY.
SO YOU'LL SEE KIND OF WHERE WE 
IDENTIFIED THE OPPORTUNITIES

[Captioner] 20:45:31
 TO 
MORE DEEPLY INTEGRATE GREEN 
PURCHASING DECISIONS INTO KIND 


[Captioner] 20:45:36
OF OUR STANDARD BUSINESS 
OPERATIONS.
>> Vice Mayor Cox:   YES

[Captioner] 20:45:40
, THAT'S 
IMPORTANT BUT ALSO MAKING SURE 
IN OUR TERMS AND CONDITIONS THAT

[Captioner] 20:45:42
 
WE'RE ADDING THAT TYPE OF 
LANGUAGE.


[Captioner] 20:45:46
BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE PART OF 
WHAT IS THE CRITERIA WHEN WE 
SELECT VENDORS

[Captioner] 20:45:51
, YOU KNOW, TO DO 
EVEN THE

[Captioner] 20:45:55
 MULCH.
EVEN TO DO THE ELECTRIC VEHICLE 
YOU KNOW ELECTRIFICATION

[Captioner] 20:45:59
 THAT 
ALL THESE TYPES OF THINGS, PORTS 
AND CHARGING STATIONS THAT ALL 


[Captioner] 20:46:03
THESE THINGS ARE IN THERE TO 
MAKE SURE THAT THAT'S A HIGH 
REQUIREMENT IN EVALUATE

[Captioner] 20:46:08
ING THOSE 
TYPE OF VENDORS AND CONTRACTORS 
THAT ARE DOING

[Captioner] 20:46:12
 THE WORK.
BUT ALSO, THAT WE'RE STILL 
ACHIEVING

[Captioner] 20:46:17
 THE GOAL EVERY STEP OF 
THE WAY.
AND JUST MAKING SURE

[Captioner] 20:46:21
 THAT'S 
BUILT IN THERE SUCCINCTLY.
BECAUSE I DON'T REALLY SEE THE 


[Captioner] 20:46:25
TIE IN ON THE ACTION PLAN.
I SEE THE --

[Captioner] 20:46:29
 WHAT WE'RE TRYING 
TO ACHIEVE BUT ALSO AHOW WE'RE 
GOING TO GET THERE

[Captioner] 20:46:33
 A LITTLE BIT 
MORE DETAIL ON EACH ONE OF THOSE 
ASPECTS OF HITTING THE

[Captioner] 20:46:39
 DIFFERENT 
SUB-- I GET IT WOULD BE 
SUBTARGETS GOING UNDER EACH

[Captioner] 20:46:43
 LINE 
THAT WE'RE ADDRESSING.
AND YOU KNOW I'M GREAT TO SEE A

[Captioner] 20:46:46
 
LOT OF 74th THAT CAME FROM THE 
DIFFERENT COMMUNITY 


[Captioner] 20:46:50
ORGANIZATIONS, STOP WEIGHS AND 
BAY EAST REALTORS AND

[Captioner] 20:46:53
 ALAMEDA 
COUNTY WATER DISTRICT.
ALL THESE TYPE OF THINGS ARE 


[Captioner] 20:46:58
VERY IMPORTANT AND EVEN THE 
SCHOOLWORKING WITH THE SCHOOLS.
THAT IT'S

[Captioner] 20:47:02
 GREAT BUT I KNOW WE 
HAD TO COORDINATE WITH OUR

[Captioner] 20:47:06
 
SCHOOL BOARD AND THE 
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE WHOLE

[Captioner] 20:47:11
 
ENTIRE ORGANIZATION, SO THAT CAN 
COUNT AS PART OF OUR BUILDINGS

[Captioner] 20:47:14
 
IN THE CITY OF FREMONT, THAT 
WE'RE UTILIZING THE GREEN 


[Captioner] 20:47:19
TECHNOLOGY.
SO I GET A LITTLE CONCERNED WHEN 
WE ADD IN SCHOOL BOARD AND 


[Captioner] 20:47:23
THINGS LIKE THAT, THAT THEY'RE 
OUR PARTNERS BUT WE DON'T HAVE

[Captioner] 20:47:26
 
THE CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS 
JURISDICTION TO SAY YOU HAVE TO 


[Captioner] 20:47:31
DO THIS.
BECAUSE WE CAN'T CONTROL THE 
SCHOOLS PER SE.

[Captioner] 20:47:35

BUT WE CAN CERTAINLY SHARE IN 
OUR VISION AND SEEMS LIKE

[Captioner] 20:47:39
 
THEY'RE VERY SUPPORTIVE BASED ON 
THE SUPPORT

[Captioner] 20:47:44
 LETTER, IF I COULD 
CALL IT THAT, THAT INTAIMS

[Captioner] 20:47:48
 ENTAILS ALL 
THE READINESS AND WILLINGNESS TO

[Captioner] 20:47:51
 
WORK WITH US AND ALL THOSE TYPE 
OF THINGS.


[Captioner] 20:47:55
LOOKING FORWARD EVEN IF THERE'S 
COLLABORATION IN SUSTAINABLE

[Captioner] 20:47:59
 SUSTAINABLE 
PUMPING AS WE GO OUT TO REPLACE 
ALL OF OUR H

[Captioner] 20:48:04
 VACS MAYBE THEY CAN 
COMBINE TOGETHER POSSIBLY SO WE 
CAN HAVE

[Captioner] 20:48:08
 MORE REDUCTION IN 
GETTING MORE

[Captioner] 20:48:14
 QUALITY PRODUCTS AT 
BETTER PRICING FOR SOME SORT OF 
LEVERAGING

[Captioner] 20:48:18
 OR SORTING UP OUR OWN 
CONSORTIUM OF

[Captioner] 20:48:21
 SUSTAINABLE 
PURCHASING.
ANOTHER PART THAT I WANTED TO 


[Captioner] 20:48:26
FIND OUT, YOU KNOW, I SIT ON THE 
BOARD FOR EAST BAY ENERGY NOW 
KNOWN AS

[Captioner] 20:48:30
 AVA.
AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE THE

[Captioner] 20:48:35
 
RENEWABLE 100 CLEAN POWER.
BUT ALSO, I HAVE TO DO A

[Captioner] 20:48:39
 BALANCE 
THAT IN SOME SENSE THERE IS A 
CONSUMER

[Captioner] 20:48:43
 PROTECTION ACTS THAT 
ARE OUT THERE THAT CONSUMERS WE 
COULD

[Captioner] 20:48:48
 SAY THIS IS OUR PREFERRED 
IF WE ARE USING LANGUAGE FOR THE 
RESOLUTION, THAT

[Captioner] 20:48:51
 IT'S SOMETHING 
THAT WE'RE PREFERRING TO DO THIS 
PLAN.


[Captioner] 20:48:55
BUT THE CONSUMER STILL HAS THE 
RIGHT BY FEDERAL LAW AND STATE 
LAW TO

[Captioner] 20:48:59
 EITHER OPT IN OR OPT OUT 
OF THE PLAN IN CASE THEY MAY

[Captioner] 20:49:04
 
HAVE SOMETHING THAT MAY 
BETTER -- THAT MAY BE A BETTER

[Captioner] 20:49:08
 
OFFERING.
BUT I AM IN SUPPORT OF IT

[Captioner] 20:49:12
.
WE JUST GOT TO BE CAREFUL WHEN 
YOU TALK ABOUT AN ORDINANCE YOU 


[Captioner] 20:49:16
CAN'T WRITE A CITY ORDINANCE AND 
IT'S STILL GOING TO BE OUT 
RESUMED

[Captioner] 20:49:20
 
RULED, RULED OUT BECAUSE WE

[Captioner] 20:49:25
 HAVE 
EXISTING CONSUMER PROTECTION 
LAWS, I SAW THAT WORDING WITH 


[Captioner] 20:49:29
THE ORDINANCE I KIND OF RAISED A 
FLAG, WORK

[Captioner] 20:49:33
 IN THE LEGAL FIELD, 
NOT A LAWYER BUT DO A LOT OF 
CONTRACT WORK THAT WE

[Captioner] 20:49:37
 CAN BE 
KIND OF SENSITIVE ABOUT THAT, 
THAT WE CAN ENCOURAGE OUR 


[Captioner] 20:49:42
RESIDENTS TO, THAT MAY BE THE 
PREFERRED METHOD BUT JUST TO BE 
VERY CAREFUL ABOUT THAT

[Captioner] 20:49:47
.
IN CASE ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE IN 
SENIOR CITIZENS THEY

[Captioner] 20:49:51
 HAVE A 
FIXED RATE THROUGH PG&E AND 
THEY'RE LESS LIKELY TO SWITCH

[Captioner] 20:49:54
 
OVER IF THEY HAVE A SET RATE AND 
THINGS LIKE THAT, THAT HAVE 


[Captioner] 20:49:59
ALREADY BEEN ESTABLISHED AS A 
LOYAL CUSTOMER FOR YEARS.
BUT ENCOURAGING THAT WE CAN

[Captioner] 20:50:03
 GET 
THE MAJORITY BUT NOT EVERYONE TO 
BE UNDERSTOOD THERE

[Captioner] 20:50:08
.
ANOTHER PART THAT I WANTED TO 
FIND OUT WAS, YOU KNOW WE TALK

[Captioner] 20:50:13
 A 
LOT ABOUT ELECTRIFICATION, 
EVERYWHERE, BUT I

[Captioner] 20:50:17
 DON'T SEE AS 
PART OF THE PLAN WE WANT TO DO 
ALL THESE

[Captioner] 20:50:21
 GREAT ACTIONS.
BUT WHAT'S THE BACKUP IN CASE

[Captioner] 20:50:27
 
THINGS -- DEPENDENT ON 
ELECTRICITY AND

[Captioner] 20:50:31
 THE GRIDS AND 
ALL THE MICROINTEGRATION AND 
THINGS LIKE THAT.


[Captioner] 20:50:35
WHERE IS THERE A BACKUP TO HELP 
US CONTINUE TO SUPPORT OUR 
COMMUNITY

[Captioner] 20:50:39
 IN THE EVENT THERE'S A 
PROBLEM WITH OUR ELECTRICAL 
POWER

[Captioner] 20:50:43
 JUST ON SUNDAY NIGHT, 
UNEXPECTEDLY IN

[Captioner] 20:50:47
 MY AREA OF 
IRVINGTON WE WENT DOWN FOR ABOUT 
AN HOUR, HOUR

[Captioner] 20:50:51
 AND A HALF WITHOUT 
ANY POWER AND THERE WAS NOT ANY 
WARNING.


[Captioner] 20:50:55
AND SO COULD YOU SHARE A LITTLE 
BIT MORE ON WHAT WOULD BE YOUR 
CONTINUITY

[Captioner] 20:50:59
 OF PLAN IN THE EVENT 
WHAT'S A BACKUP IN THE EVENT 
THERE'S

[Captioner] 20:51:04
 AN ELECTRIFICATION, IF 
IT GOES DOWN, HOW DO YOU INTEND 
TO

[Captioner] 20:51:07
 SUPPORT OUR COMMUNITY AND 
KEEP THINGS UP AND RUNNING?
>> YES.


[Captioner] 20:51:11
SO IN TERMS OF ELECTRIFICATION, 
YOU KNOW WE FOCUS A LOT

[Captioner] 20:51:15
 ON HOW 
DO WE TAPER OFF OF FOSSIL FUELS 
BUT ALSO

[Captioner] 20:51:20
 HOW DO WE INCREASE 
ENERGY RESILIENCY MORE

[Captioner] 20:51:23
 
HOLISTICALLY?
SO WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT, YOU 


[Captioner] 20:51:27
KNOW, ADOPTING CODES FOR NEW 
CONSTRUCTION AND THEN WE'RE 
LOOKING AT WAYS THAT WE CAN 


[Captioner] 20:51:31
SUPPORT THE TRANSITION IN 
EXISTING BUILDINGS, THERE IS A 
VERY HEAVY

[Captioner] 20:51:35
 FOCUS ON HOW DO WE 
ENCOURAGE OR REQUIRE ON SITE

[Captioner] 20:51:39
 
RENEWABLES, SUPPORTED WITH 
BATTERY BACKUP, SO THAT

[Captioner] 20:51:43
 IN THE 
EVENT OF AN OUTAGE AT THE GRID 
LEVEL THERE IS THAT OPPORTUNITY

[Captioner] 20:51:47
 
TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE YOUR OWN 
ELECTRIC POWER AND

[Captioner] 20:51:52
 UTILIZE 
EITHER AN ONSITE BATTERY OR IN 
THE FUTURE, BE ABLE TO TAP

[Captioner] 20:51:56
 INTO 
THE BATTERY WITHIN YOUR ELECTRIC 
VEHICLE AND PULL FROM YOUR 


[Captioner] 20:52:00
ELECTRIC VEHICLE THE STORED 
POWER TO KEEP YOUR

[Captioner] 20:52:04
 HOUSE RUNNING 
WHEN THERE IS AN OUTAGE FOR A 
NUMBER OF HOURS.

[Captioner] 20:52:08

AND I'VE SEEN SOME STUDIES 
WHERE, YOU KNOW, A FULLY CHARGED

[Captioner] 20:52:12
 
ELECTRIC VEHICLE COULD ACTUALLY 
SUPPORT A HOME FOR A FEW DAYS.


[Captioner] 20:52:16
YOU KNOW, DEPENDING ON WHAT KIND 
OF ELECTRIC LOAD YOU HAVE.
SO THOSE

[Captioner] 20:52:21
 OTHER, YOU KNOW, THINGS 
THAT WE DEFINITELY HAVE BEEN, 
YOU KNOW, LOOKING AT,

[Captioner] 20:52:25
 HOW DO WE 
ENCOURAGE EXISTING HOMES AND 
BUSINESS

[Captioner] 20:52:29
ES, TO CONTINUE TO 
INSTALL RENEWABLES, ADDING

[Captioner] 20:52:34
 IN 
BACKUP POWER, WHEREVER POSSIBLE, 
WE ALSO HAVE A

[Captioner] 20:52:38
 FOCUS WITHIN THE 
RESILIENCY AND

[Captioner] 20:52:42
 ADAPTATION PART 
OF THE PLAN AT LOOKING AT A 
RESILL

[Captioner] 20:52:47
 
RESILIENCY HUBS IN A MORE

[Captioner] 20:52:51
 
PROACTIVE WAY.
HEAT EVENTS OR OTHER INCLEMENT

[Captioner] 20:52:56
 
WEATHER, PEOPLE CAN COME TO OUR 
COMMUNITY CENTERS TO GET THE 


[Captioner] 20:53:00
RESOURCES WE NEED.
WE CAN LOOK AT WAYS TO SUPPORT 
THOSE LOCATIONS

[Captioner] 20:53:04
 WITH ENERGY 
SYSTEMS THAT WOULD MAKE THEM 
MORE RESILIENT AS WELL.


[Captioner] 20:53:09
AGAIN THAT WOULD BE SOLAR AND 
BATTERY STORAGE AND WE ARE 
WORKING

[Captioner] 20:53:13
 CURRENTLY WITH AVA TO 
INSTALL ADDITIONAL MICROGRIDS ON

[Captioner] 20:53:17
 
OTHER CITY FACILITIES AND WE'VE 
IDENTIFIED SOME OF OUR COMMUNITY

[Captioner] 20:53:21
 
CENTERS AS PART OF THOSE.
I ALSO WANTED TO QUICKLY ADDRESS 


[Captioner] 20:53:25
THE COMMENT AROUND THE RENEWABLE 
AND 100 OPT-

[Captioner] 20:53:29
UP.
SO STATE LAW ALLOWS FOR 
COMMUNITY

[Captioner] 20:53:34
 CHOICE AUTHORITIES TO 
BE, YOU KNOW, A DEFAULT 
ENROLLMENT AND

[Captioner] 20:53:38
 THEN OPT OUT AS 

[Captioner] 20:53:42
 
AN OPTION FOR CUSTOMERS.
THAT'S WHAT HAS REALLY ALLOWED 


[Captioner] 20:53:47
CCA'S TO BE ABLE TO ROLL OUT IN 
A FEDERATE SUBSTANTIAL

[Captioner] 20:53:51
 MANNER 
ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA 
OVER THE LAST TEN FULL YEARS.


[Captioner] 20:53:55
WE HAVE THE ABILITY FOR ANYBODY 
WHO WOULD BE ENROLLED IN 
RENEWABLE 100

[Captioner] 20:53:59
 TO SAY NO, I DON'T 
WANT TO GO UP.
I WANT TO STAY

[Captioner] 20:54:04
 AT THE BRIGHT 
CHOICE LEVEL OR I WOULD PREFER 
TO NOT BE A PART

[Captioner] 20:54:08
 OF AVA AND BE A 
PG&E CUSTOMER.
THAT CHOICE IS ALWAYS

[Captioner] 20:54:12
 THERE.

[Captioner] 20:54:17

AS WE MOVE FORWARD IN PURSUING 
THIS POLICY THERE WILL BE VERY

[Captioner] 20:54:21
 
HEAVY COMMUNITY OUTREACH AND 
ENGAGEMENT TO BE

[Captioner] 20:54:25
 SURE EVERYBODY 
IS WELL AWARE OF THESE CHOICES.
WE DID THIS WHEN WE

[Captioner] 20:54:29
 WERE FIRST 
ROLLING OUT EVCE IN

[Captioner] 20:54:33
 2018 TO 
BUSINESSES AS WELL, THIS IS A 
BIG CAMPAIGN.

[Captioner] 20:54:37

THERE IS ACTUALLY EIGHT CITIES 
THAT HAVE ADOPTED RENEWABLE 100 


[Captioner] 20:54:41
AS THE DEFAULT FOR RESIDENTS AND 
BUSINESSES.
AND SIX THAT HAVE NOT.

[Captioner] 20:54:45

WE'RE ONE OF THE SIX THAT HAVE 
NOT.

[Captioner] 20:54:51

SO MY UNDERSTANDING IS THERE ARE 
A FEW CITIES THAT ARE LOOKING TO 


[Captioner] 20:54:55
DO THIS IN THE COMING YEAR AS 
WELL AND WE COULD BE PART OF 
THAT COHORT.

[Captioner] 20:54:59

AND THIS IS REALLY TO MOVE THE 
NEEDLE BEFORE

[Captioner] 20:55:03
 EBCE HAS 
ROOUBILITY 100 AS THE DEFAULT 
FOR

[Captioner] 20:55:07
 EVERYBODY.
AND THERE WILL

[Captioner] 20:55:12
 BE A

[Captioner] 20:55:16
 ALTERNATIVE 
FOR LOW INCOME CUSTOMERS.
>> I

[Captioner] 20:55:21
 APPRECIATE YOU MAKING SURE 
THAT THAT'S GOING TO BE WORDED 
ACCORDINGLY BECAUSE

[Captioner] 20:55:25
 WHEN I JUST 
READ WHEN I READ THAT IT DOESN'T 
ALLOW FOR

[Captioner] 20:55:29
 THAT PART OF THE 
EXPLANATION THERE.
AND I APPRECIATE THE 


[Captioner] 20:55:33
CLARIFICATION ON THAT.

[Captioner] 20:55:38

I KNOW THAT, I FEEL PART OF THE 
PLAN SHOULD ALSO HAVE A LIST

[Captioner] 20:55:41
 OF 
SOME BACKUP OPPORTUNITIES AND 
OPTIONS FOR US.


[Captioner] 20:55:45
BECAUSE IT WOULD NOT BE COMPLETE 
WITHOUT THAT.
AND THAT WOULD BE PROBABLY

[Captioner] 20:55:49
 
SOMETHING THAT WOULD LIKE TO 
SEE,

[Captioner] 20:55:54
 TO MAKES SURE THAT THAT'S 
CLEAR WITH THE RESIDENTS THAT WE 
ARE

[Captioner] 20:55:58
 PLANNING TO DO THIS, AND 
IT'S A PHASE-IN TYPE

[Captioner] 20:56:02
 OF 
ARRANGEMENT, BECAUSE EVERYTHING 
CAN'T BE DONE ALL AT ONCE.


[Captioner] 20:56:06
AND -- BUT KNOWING THAT WE HAVE 
SOME OPTIONS OF BESIDES THE

[Captioner] 20:56:09
 
WARMING CENTER AND THINGS LIKE 
THAT BUT MORE CONCERN, YOU KNOW, 


[Captioner] 20:56:14
AS WE'VE HEARD ABOUT CONCERN 
FROM PUBLIC COMMENT

[Captioner] 20:56:18
 ON CRIME 
THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT 
OUR POLICE AND ALL

[Captioner] 20:56:22
 OF THEIR 
VEHICLES AND OUR FIRE ARE 24

[Captioner] 20:56:26
/7 
AND THEN SOME WITH EXTRA 
TRANSFORMERS

[Captioner] 20:56:30
 
TRANSFORMERS AND YEERK 
SUSTAINABILITY THAT IS GOING TO 


[Captioner] 20:56:35
KEEP THEM UP 24 -- AND BEYOND 
THE THREE DAYS OF OPERATION JUST 
IN THE EVENT THAT

[Captioner] 20:56:39
 WE JUST HAVE 
CONTINUATION OF CONTINUITY OF 
OPERATIONS FOR THE

[Captioner] 20:56:42
 CITY.
AND THAT'S WHERE I'M COMING 
FROM.


[Captioner] 20:56:46
AND LOOKING AT THAT WHEN I LOOK 
AT A PLAN I ALWAYS LOOK AT SOME 
OF THE

[Captioner] 20:56:50
 BACKUP AS WELL TO KEEP US 
GOING.
ANOTHER FARTHER

[Captioner] 20:56:54
 IS ARE YOU 
PLANNING AT ANY POINT TO USE ANY 
TYPE OF ARTIFICIAL

[Captioner] 20:56:58
 INTELLIGENCE, 
AND ANALYZING HOW THINGS ARE 
OCCURRING

[Captioner] 20:57:03
 WITH THE CLIMATE 
ACTION PLAN GOING FORWARD

[Captioner] 20:57:08
?
>> I HAVE NEVER HAD THAT 
QUESTION POSED TO ME SO NO, I'M

[Captioner] 20:57:12
 
NOT PLANNING ON THAT AS OF YET.
THERE MAY BE

[Captioner] 20:57:16
 THOUGHTS AT THE 
STATE LEVEL ON HOW THEY MIGHT 
START THINKING ABOUT THAT

[Captioner] 20:57:20
.
BUT WE'RE REALLY FOCUSED ON, YOU 
KNOW, DIRECT ACTIONS

[Captioner] 20:57:25
 THAT 
INVOLVE EITHER POLICY OR 
PROJECTS OR

[Captioner] 20:57:29
 PROGRAMS FOR THE 
COMMUNITY.
>> Vice Mayor Cox:   OKAY.


[Captioner] 20:57:33
JUST ANOTHER TOOL THAT 
CONSTANTLY COULD BE OUT THERE 
FOR PRODUCTIVITY AND

[Captioner] 20:57:37
 KIND OF 
HELPING TO RANK SOME OF THESE 
PROJECTS INTO MORE OF A

[Captioner] 20:57:41
 HIGHER 
IMPACT IF THERE'S SOME OTHER 
TOOLS OUT THERE THAT CAN BE 


[Captioner] 20:57:45
PURSUED THERE.
AT THIS TIME, I THINK I'VE 
COMPLETED MY

[Captioner] 20:57:49
 FIRST ROUND OF 
QUESTIONS BUT THANK YOU VERY 
MUCH FOR YOUR

[Captioner] 20:57:53
 CLARIFICATIONS AND 
AGAIN THANK YOU FOR YOUR TEAM 
FOR THEIR HARD WORK ON THIS

[Captioner] 20:57:57
.
>> THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei:   COUNCILMEMBER 


[Captioner] 20:58:01
CAMPBELL DO YOU HAVE CLARIFYING 
QUESTIONS BEFORE I BEGIN MINE?
OKAY THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:58:05
SO THANK YOU AGAIN, SO SOME OF 
THE CLARIFYING QUESTIONS I HAD 
IS I KNOW

[Captioner] 20:58:09
 THAT JUST TO LET YOU 
KNOW I THINK WE HAD THE 
CONVERSATION

[Captioner] 20:58:13
 PREVIOUSLY WITH NOW 
AVA FORMERLY

[Captioner] 20:58:17
 EBCE WHEN WE 
STARTED AND PART OF IT WAS TO 
ENSURE

[Captioner] 20:58:22
 THE CONSUMERS ARE BEING 
PROTECTED, IT WAS NOT JUST THE 
COST,

[Captioner] 20:58:26
 BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO 
GO -- PART OF IT WAS TIMING FOR 
US

[Captioner] 20:58:30
.
I THINK HAVING THE POLICY AS WE 
MOVE FORWARD WHERE IT'S AN OPT

[Captioner] 20:58:34
 
OUT RATHER THAN OPT IN, MAYBE A 
DIRECTION FOR THE FIRST PHASE

[Captioner] 20:58:38
, 
ONE OF THE DELAYS FOR US IS THE 
COST FOR THE CONSUMERS AND THE

[Captioner] 20:58:41
 
SENIORS.
SO DO YOU THINK THERE'S BEEN 


[Captioner] 20:58:45
GREATER OUTREACH SINCE THEN THAT 
WOULD ALLOW US OR JUST THE FACT 
THAT THERE'S

[Captioner] 20:58:49
 MORE ADOPTION 
GRADERS THAT WOULD BE ABLE TO 
MAKE THAT TRANSITION FOR THE

[Captioner] 20:58:52
 
CITY?
I KNOW WE AS A BUSINESS HAVE 


[Captioner] 20:58:57
DONE THAT BUT ALSO FOR THE 
CONSUMERS DO YOU THINK WE NEED 
ODO MORE OUTREACH IN THAT

[Captioner] 20:59:01
 AREA?
>> JUST TO CLARIFY, ARE YOU 
ASKING ABOUT OUTREACH

[Captioner] 20:59:04
 TO 
ENCOURAGE --
>> Mayor Mei:   YES.


[Captioner] 20:59:08
>>   -- OPTING UP TO 100 WITHOUT 
A POLICY?
>> Mayor Mei:  

[Captioner] 20:59:11
 NO WITH A 
POLICY.
I THINK PART OF IT IS HAVING 


[Captioner] 20:59:16
PEOPLE AS A CARROT AND STICK 
APPROACH A LITTLE BIT AND WE'RE

[Captioner] 20:59:20
 
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW CAN WE 
HAVE THE CARROT ASPECT FROM THE

[Captioner] 20:59:23
 
ENVIRONMENT WE'VE SEEN THESE 
LAST COUPLE OF YEARS, CERTAINLY 


[Captioner] 20:59:27
SOME OF THE DRAMATIC WEATHER 
CHANGES AND IMPACTS, DO YOU 
THINK PEOPLE WOULD MUCH HAVE

[Captioner] 20:59:31
 -- 
BECAUSE ALSO WE ARE COMING OUT 
OF THE PANDEMIC

[Captioner] 20:59:35
, WE HOPE TO STAY 
THAT WAY, AND AT THAT TIME WE 
WERE LOOKING AT THE 


[Captioner] 20:59:39
CONSIDERATION THERE WAS A 
SHUTDOWN AND A LOT OF THEM ARE 
MORE UNKNOWNS

[Captioner] 20:59:43
.
DO YOU THINK AT THIS TIME AS A 
CITY IN YOUR OUTREACH I KNOW 


[Captioner] 20:59:47
THERE WAS SOME DISCUSSION 
EARLIER THIS EVENING ABOUT SOME 
OF THE 84th REACH IN OUR

[Captioner] 20:59:50
 
GRAPHIC DESIGN AND CUSTOMERS IN 
OUR CITY.


[Captioner] 20:59:54
DO YOU THINK THE RESIDENTS ARE 
READY TO ADOPTIVE THE AV

[Captioner] 20:59:58
A 
RENEWABLE 100?
>> WE CAN GET A SENSE OF THAT 


[Captioner] 21:00:02
THROUGH ADDITIONAL OUTREACH.
IN TERMS OF THE PERCENTAGE THAT 
HAVE

[Captioner] 21:00:06
 OPTED UP WITHOUT A POLICY 
IN PLACE, YOU KNOW, THAT'S

[Captioner] 21:00:11
 A 
VERY SMALL AMOUNT OF OUR 
CUSTOMERS FROM FREMONT

[Captioner] 21:00:15
.
THE ONE THING THAT I CAN SHARE 
IS, IN

[Captioner] 21:00:19
 JUNE EBCE NOW AVA UPDATED 
THEIR

[Captioner] 21:00:24
 RATES AND SO THE PREMIUM 
ON THE RENEWABLE 100 PLAN

[Captioner] 21:00:28
 USED 
TO BE THREE QUARTERS OF A CENT 
HIGHER THAN PG&E AND NOW IT'S

[Captioner] 21:00:32
 
ONE QUARTER OF A CENT HIGHER 
THAN PG&E.


[Captioner] 21:00:36
IT IS REDUCING IN PRICE 
COMPARATIVELY SPEAKING TO PG&E.
THE BRIGHT CHOICE

[Captioner] 21:00:42
 PRODUCTS HAVE 
ALSO BEEN REDUCED IN PRICE SO IT 
WAS 3% LOWER THAN

[Captioner] 21:00:46
 PG&E NOW 5% 
LOWER.
SO THERE IS A DIFFERENTIAL 


[Captioner] 21:00:50
BETWEEN BRIGHT CHOICE AND 
RENEWABLE 100 AND THAT'S WHAT 
WE'LL BE COMMUNICATING WITH

[Captioner] 21:00:54
 
RESIDENTS AND BUSINESSES.
HERE IS WHAT YOU

[Captioner] 21:00:58
 CAN EXPECT TO 
SEE THERE THIS CHANGE.
AN AVERAGE BILL WOULD INCREASE

[Captioner] 21:01:01
 
BY X AMOUNT.
THESE ARE THE BENEFITS IF YOU 


[Captioner] 21:01:06
CHOOSE TO NOT PARTICIPATE HERE 
ARE THE WAYS THAT YOU CAN OPT 
OUT

[Captioner] 21:01:07
.
>> Mayor Mei:   THAT'S VERY 
HELPFUL.


[Captioner] 21:01:11
I KNOW WHEN WE MADE THAT 
ORIGINAL COMMITMENT AS ONE OF 
THE FOUNDING MEMBERS

[Captioner] 21:01:15
 THE CITY OF 
FREMONT AND US SERVING ON IT HAD 
THE OPPORTUNITY.


[Captioner] 21:01:19
I KNOW WE MADE THAT COMMITMENT 
TO THE CONSUMERS TOO.
THE

[Captioner] 21:01:23
 OTHER PIECE IS THAT WE 
TALKED ABOUT BATTERY BACKUP AND 
RESILIENCY AND

[Captioner] 21:01:27
 REDUNDANCY.
ARE WE DOING SOME OUTREACH?
I KNOW WE HAVE BEEN VERY

[Captioner] 21:01:32
 
FORTUNATE AS A CITY TO PILOT AND 
PHI NEAR A LOT OF THIS WITH OUR

[Captioner] 21:01:36
 
FIRE STATIONS AND WE HAVE TALKED 
ABOUT WE'VE SELECTED ANOTHER

[Captioner] 21:01:40
 
EIGHT LOCATIONS HERE IN THE CITY 
TO LOOK AT BACKUPS AND THEN ALSO

[Captioner] 21:01:44
 
BECAUSE THE INVENTATION YOU 
WHICH ARE JUST TALKING ABOUT, 


[Captioner] 21:01:48
YOU JUST TALKED ABOUT IT IN THE 
FIRST PHASE, WE DIDN'T KNOW WE 
WOULD

[Captioner] 21:01:53
 JOIN EBCE, THE TWO WAY OR 
BI

[Captioner] 21:01:58
LATERAL CHARGING OPTIONS IN 
THE FUTURE.
WITH EACH

[Captioner] 21:02:03
 REV THAT WE CREATE 
MAYBE THAT'S SOMETHING WE NEED 
TO ADOPT IN

[Captioner] 21:02:07
 OUR FACILITIES 
WHETHER IT'S THE COMMUNITY 
CENTERS AND OTHERS SO WE CAN 


[Captioner] 21:02:11
HAVE SOME RESILIENCY HUBS.
IS THAT SOMETHING THAT WE ARE 
LOOKING INTO WHEN

[Captioner] 21:02:14
 WE MADE THE 
PLANS?
I KNOW THE PLANS WERE MADE ABOUT 


[Captioner] 21:02:18
A YEAR AND A HALF TWO YEARS AGO 
BUT AT THE SAME TIME AS WE'RE 
ADOPTING AND MAKING

[Captioner] 21:02:23
 THOSE ACTUAL 
IMPLEMENTATIONS, WE SHOULD BE 
UTILIZED WHAT IS THE LATE

[Captioner] 21:02:28
 -- WE 
SHOULD BE UTILIZING WHATEVER IS 
THE LATE

[Captioner] 21:02:32
EST.
>> COUNCIL PROVIDED A RESOLUTION

[Captioner] 21:02:36
 
SAYING IF THE END OF THE PROJECT 
LOOKED FAVORABLE FOR

[Captioner] 21:02:39
 THE CITY WE 
WOULD MOVE FORWARD ON THOSE 
SITES.


[Captioner] 21:02:43
YOU KNOW, WE ARE WAITING TO 
RECEIVE MORE INFORMATION

[Captioner] 21:02:47
 FROM 
AVCE ON WHAT

[Captioner] 21:02:51
 THOSE PROJECTS 
WOULD LOOK LIKE, WHAT THAT 
EQUIPMENT WOULD EVOLVE

[Captioner] 21:02:56
 INVOLVE, WHAT

[Captioner] 21:03:00
 
WE'LL HAVE MORE INFORMATION TO 
SHARE ON A FUTURE DATE.


[Captioner] 21:03:04
WHAT THE INFORMATION I WANTED TO 
SHARE ON RESIDENTIAL, TALKING 
ABOUT BATTERY

[Captioner] 21:03:08
 BACKUP, WE 
PARTICIPATED IN THE BAY AREA SUN 
SHARES PROGRAM FOR A NUMBER OF 


[Captioner] 21:03:12
YEARS NOW AND THAT'S AN EFFORT 
TO PROVIDE UP FRONT DISCOUNTED 
PRICING

[Captioner] 21:03:17
 ON SOLAR SYSTEMS FOR 
FREMONT RESIDENTS.
AND THERE'S

[Captioner] 21:03:21
 A BATTERY STORAGE 
OPTION THAT'S INCREASINGLY 
POPULAR

[Captioner] 21:03:26
.
I'VE SEEN, YOU KNOW, MORE THAN 
10% OF

[Captioner] 21:03:30
 RESIDENTIAL SOLAR 
INSTALLS NOW IN FREMONT ARE 
GOING IN WITH BATTERY

[Captioner] 21:03:34
 SYSTEMS AS 
WELL.
>> Mayor Mei:   YES, I JUST

[Captioner] 21:03:38
 
ADOPTED ONE MYSELF A WHILE BACK 
BUT I HAVE NOT DONE THE BATTERY 


[Captioner] 21:03:42
STORAGE YET BUT I'M SLOWLY 
BUILDING TO THAT

[Captioner] 21:03:45
 INFRASTRUCTURE 
MYSELF.
SPEAKING OF WHICH WHEN IT COMES 


[Captioner] 21:03:49
TO THIS PAST WEEK WE HAD CMTA 
AND CALIFORNIA

[Captioner] 21:03:53
 MANUFACTURERS 
TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION HAD 
RECOGNIZED SOME OF OUR VENDORS.


[Captioner] 21:03:57
AND SEEING THAT WE HAVE A HUGE 
BASE AND FOUNDATION

[Captioner] 21:04:00
 WITH 
MANUFACTURING, WHAT TYPE OF 
OUTREACH ARE WE DOING?


[Captioner] 21:04:04
BECAUSE I WILL TELL YOU ON THE 
TOURS THAT I ATTENDED WE HAD 13 
TOURS AND I ATTEND

[Captioner] 21:04:08
ED SIX OF THEM 
AND I KNOW THERE IS A LOT OF THE 
COMPANIES WHO THEMSELVES ARE 


[Captioner] 21:04:13
MAKING THESE TRANSITIONS AND 
ADOPTIONS IN THEIR POLICIES AND 
ARE REALLY WORKING HARD WITH 


[Captioner] 21:04:16
THEIR OWN TEAMS.
IS THERE ANYTHING THAT WE ARE 
DOING IN TERMS OF ECONOMIC 


[Captioner] 21:04:20
DEVELOPMENT OR THERE YOUR SIDE 
TO OUTREACH TO THOSE 
ORGANIZATIONS OR SOME OF THE

[Captioner] 21:04:24
 
TRADE ASSOCIATIONS?
>> I'VE WORKED CLOSELY WITH OUR 


[Captioner] 21:04:29
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DIRECTOR 
DONOVAN LAZARO ON

[Captioner] 21:04:33
 OUTREACHING TO 
A LOT OF OUR LARGER BUSINESS 
CUSTOMERS IN TREATMENT IN 


[Captioner] 21:04:37
PREPARATION FOR THE PLAN DOING 
OUTREACH ASKING THEM, YOU KNOW,

[Captioner] 21:04:41
 
WHAT THEY'RE INTERESTED IN 
SEEING, WHAT THEY'RE CURRENTLY 


[Captioner] 21:04:46
DOING, WHAT THEY'D LIKE TO SEE 
MORE OF, WHAT THEY WOULD BE 
74thIVE OF THE CITY

[Captioner] 21:04:49
 DOING AND 
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE 
IDENTIFIED IN THE PLAN THAT WE 


[Captioner] 21:04:54
WOULD LIKE TO IMPLEMENT ON IN 
THE SHORT TERM GAME PLAN

[Captioner] 21:04:58
 IS 
DOING MORE PROGRAMMING EVENTS TO

[Captioner] 21:05:02
 
SHOWCASE WHAT SOME OF OUR 
BUSINESSES ARE DOING,

[Captioner] 21:05:05
 THE 
INNOVATIVE THINGS THEY HAVE BEEN 
ABLE TO IMPLEMENT.


[Captioner] 21:05:09
SHARING THAT WITH OTHER 
BUSINESSES IN FREMONT AND KIND 
OF PROVIDING A CASE STUDY

[Captioner] 21:05:12
 AND 
INFORMATION SHARING 
OPPORTUNITIES FOR THEM.


[Captioner] 21:05:16
>> Mayor Mei:   NO, I DEFINITELY 
THINK THERE'S SOME GREAT 
OPPORTUNITIES

[Captioner] 21:05:20
.
DELTA ELECTRONICS HAS BEEN NOTED 
BEING LEED PLATINUM

[Captioner] 21:05:24
 AND SEAGATE 
THEY HAVE USED EVERYTHING THERE 
SOLAR, GEE

[Captioner] 21:05:30
 GEOTHERMAL, I'M CERTAINLY 
WILLING

[Captioner] 21:05:35
 TO RINSE RELOAD AND 
REPEAT NOT JUST THE WATER

[Captioner] 21:05:39
.
ESPECIALLY I THINK THERE IS SOME 
INTERESTING SKEPTICS

[Captioner] 21:05:44
 
INTERESTING CONCEPTS, THEY WERE 
LOOKING

[Captioner] 21:05:49
 AT VIRTUAL EARTH AND 
OTHER CONCEPTS, SOMETHING

[Captioner] 21:05:53
 YOU 
CAN INNOVATE, TO HELP

[Captioner] 21:05:56
 US 
CALCULATE WHAT IS THE BEST 
SOLUTIONS.


[Captioner] 21:06:00
I KNOW THIS IS AN EVER CHANGING 
WORLD.
HOPEFULLY WE CAN MAKE

[Captioner] 21:06:04
 GREAT 
THESE THINGS.
I ALSO KNOW WE HAVE NINE 


[Captioner] 21:06:08
SPEAKERS.
IF WE WANT TO GO THROUGH THE 
SPEAKER CARDS, 10 PUBLIC 


[Captioner] 21:06:12
SPEAKERS IF WE CAN CALL THEM UP 
AND ONE IS GOING TO BE OUR

[Captioner] 21:06:16
 GRAY 
WATER DISCUSSION.
>> The Clerk:   JOHN HINES

[Captioner] 21:06:20
 IS 
THE FIRST SPEAKER FOLLOWED BY 
RICHARD GODFREY.

[Captioner] 21:06:24

>> HOW MUCH TIME FOR THIS ONE?
>> Mayor Mei:   TWO MINUTES IS 


[Captioner] 21:06:28
THAT OKAY?
>> I'LL PASS, OKAY.
>> Mayor Mei:   DO YOU NEED MORE 


[Captioner] 21:06:32
THAN TWO?
>> THIS WOULD BE THREE.
BUT EVERYBODY GETS THE SAME

[Captioner] 21:06:38
.
>> Mayor Mei:   OKAY.
IF YOU

[Captioner] 21:06:42
 WOULD LIKE TO SEND IT TO 
US IN WRITING WE WOULD LOVE TO 
SEE IT STILL TOO.


[Captioner] 21:06:49
>> I TALK FAST AND THANK YOU FOR 
THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT.
FIRST I WANT TO TALK

[Captioner] 21:06:53
 A LITTLE 
BIT ABOUT THE GOOD BAD AND THE 
UGLY AND NICELY THERE'S REALLY 


[Captioner] 21:06:58
NOTHING UGLY.
THE GOOD IS EXTRAORDINARY JOB ON 
BEHALF OF DAN

[Captioner] 21:07:03
 AND RACHEL AND ALL 
OF YOU THAT HAVE PARTICIPATED IN 
THE CLIMATE

[Captioner] 21:07:07
 ACTION PLAN WE THINK 
IT'S EXTREMELY WELL DONE WITH 
THE HUGE AMOUNT OF WORK

[Captioner] 21:07:11
 THAT 
WENT INTO IT.
SO ONE OF THE AREAS THAT IS 


[Captioner] 21:07:15
GOOD, AND THIS IS REGARDING WE 
TALKED EARLIER ABOUT PROBLEMS 
WITH

[Captioner] 21:07:19
 ANIMAL CODE AND WITH THE 
ANIMAL SERVICES HERE IN FREMONT 
AND

[Captioner] 21:07:24
 THE OHLONE HEALTH SYSTEM.
AND ONE OF THE WAYS THAT

[Captioner] 21:07:28
 WE 
ACTUALLY SOLVED A PROBLEM WAS TO 
GO AND COLLABORATE WITH THE

[Captioner] 21:07:31
 
NONPROFITS.
SO IN THIS CASE WE GATHERED A 


[Captioner] 21:07:36
WAY TO WORK WITH THE ALAMEDA BEE 
KEEP

[Captioner] 21:07:40
ERS WE TAKE CARE OF MOST OF 
THE BEE PROBLEMS HERE IN 
TREATMENT AND WE NO

[Captioner] 21:07:44
 LONGER HAVE 
TO PAY EXTENSIVE REGISTRATION 
FEES SO THANK YOU

[Captioner] 21:07:48
 ALL IN WORKING 
IN GREEN WITH THAT.
I WANT TO SPEAK A LITTLE BIT 


[Captioner] 21:07:52
TOWARDS TREES AND THAT IS JUST 
TO SAY THAT, YOU KNOW, THE

[Captioner] 21:07:57
 URBAN 
TREFTARY MASTER PLAN HAS -- 
FOREST

[Captioner] 21:08:02
RY MASTER PLAN HAS 134 
PAGE VERY DETAILED PROGRAM.
AND

[Captioner] 21:08:06
 ONE OF THE THINGS THAT 
STANDS OUT WE HAVE 14.4% URBAN

[Captioner] 21:08:09
 
CANOPY BUT WE WANT TO GET TO 
24%.


[Captioner] 21:08:14
HOW DO WE DO THAT SO THIS YEAR 
IT'S ANTICIPATED WE'LL

[Captioner] 21:08:18
 PLANT 800 
TREES, TOWARDS THE END IT IS

[Captioner] 21:08:22
 
ANTICIPATED THAT WE WILL

[Captioner] 21:08:27
 PLANT 
700 TREES NOT LIKELY.

[Captioner] 21:08:29

SO THANK YOU FOR THIS 
OPPORTUNITY.


[Captioner] 21:08:33
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.
>> The Clerk:   STEVE SCALO 
FOLLOWED BY ABE

[Captioner] 21:08:37
.
>> Mayor Mei:   WELCOME STEVE.


[Captioner] 21:08:42
>> THANK YOU MAYOR AND COUNCIL.
SO AS I REVIEWED THIS PLAN AND 
DID

[Captioner] 21:08:46
 A FAIR AMOUNT OF PUBLIC 
OUTREACH, TO SUPPORT IT

[Captioner] 21:08:51
, ONE OF 
THE THINGS THAT REALLY STRIKES 
ME ARE A COUPLE OF THINGS

[Captioner] 21:08:55
.
ONE THERE IS A LOT OF 
CORRESPONDENCE TO THE GENERAL 


[Captioner] 21:08:59
PLAN AND THIS ISN'T A PLAN THAT 
REALLY IS THERE TO SAVE THE 
PLANET

[Captioner] 21:09:03
 BUT HAS A SIGNIFICANT 
IMPACT RELATED TO THE QUALITY OF 
LIFE OF EVERYBODY

[Captioner] 21:09:07
 IN FREMONT.
AND MANY OF THE ACTIONS HERE ARE 
GOING TO HELP PEOPLE IN MANY 


[Captioner] 21:09:12
WAYS.
A FEW EXAMPLES, PEOPLE WANT THE 
ABILITY TO WALK TO AMENITIES

[Captioner] 21:09:15
 SO 
THEY DON'T HAVE TO DRIVE 
EVERYWHERE.


[Captioner] 21:09:19
WELL HOW MANY TIMES HAVE YOU AND 
COUNCIL TALKED ABOUT THE 
IMPORTANCE OF

[Captioner] 21:09:23
 HAVING VIBRANT 
NEIGHBORHOODS?
IT'S REALLY THE SAME THING.


[Captioner] 21:09:27
WE NEED TO MAKE IT HAPPEN BY 
IMPLEMENTING THE ACTIONS OF THIS 
PLAN.


[Captioner] 21:09:31
YOU CAN LOOK AROUND TOWN AND SEE 
MANY IMPORTANT ACTIONS

[Captioner] 21:09:35
 LIKE AN 
EXAMPLE, PERSON WHO RECENTLY 
BOUGHT AN ELECTRIC SCOOTER

[Captioner] 21:09:40
 AND 
TAKES IT ON BART TO GET TO WORK 
BECAUSE IT COST LESS

[Captioner] 21:09:43
 THAN FIXING 
HIS CAR.
IF YOU SEE THE HANDFUL OF OTHER 


[Captioner] 21:09:48
PEOPLE THAT TAKE A BICYCLE OR 
SCOOTER ON AND OFF EVERY

[Captioner] 21:09:52
 SINGLE 
BART TRAIFN YOU'LL SEE THAT THE 
SUPPORT FOR ACTIVE TRANSIT IS

[Captioner] 21:09:56
 
NOT ONLY HELPING THE PLANET BUT 
IT'S HELPING PEOPLE KEEP THEIR 


[Captioner] 21:10:00
JOBS AND STILL PAY RENT.
THE YOUNG PROFESSIONALS THAT ARE 
HERE,

[Captioner] 21:10:04
 AND ARE SHARING A CAR AND 
TAKING TRANSIT WHENEVER POSSIBLE 
THEY'RE

[Captioner] 21:10:08
 NOT ONLY REDUCING VMT 
BUT THEY'RE ALSO TRYING TO SAVE 
MONEY FOR

[Captioner] 21:10:12
 A DOWN PAYMENT FOR 
WHAT'S NOW LIKE AN $

[Captioner] 21:10:16
800,000 
STARTER CONDO WHICH IS SOMETHING 
WE DIDN'T HAVE TO DO US OLD

[Captioner] 21:10:20
ER 
GENERATION.
SO PLEASE I HOPE YOU LOOK AT 


[Captioner] 21:10:24
THIS NOT JUST AS AN ESOTERIC 
PLAN

[Captioner] 21:10:28
 THAT SAVES THE PLANET BUT 
SOMETHING THAT REALLY HELPS 
ABOUT

[Captioner] 21:10:31
 THE 
PEOPLE IN THE CITY CONTINUE TO 
STAY HERE.


[Captioner] 21:10:35
I HOPE YOU CAN LOOK AT IT

[Captioner] 21:10:40
 
EMBRACE IT AND AGGRESSIVELY 
IMPLEMENT IT.


[Captioner] 21:10:42
THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei:   NEXT SPEAKER, 
WELCOME ABE.


[Captioner] 21:10:51
>> GOOD EVENING.
CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS, MAYOR MEI

[Captioner] 21:10:55
, 
AND CITY STAFF.
I ALSO WOULD

[Captioner] 21:10:59
 LIKE TO THANK THE 
SUSTAINABILITY COMMITTEE FOR ALL 
THEIR

[Captioner] 21:11:03
 HARD WORK IN PUTTING THIS 
PLAN TOGETHER.
AND I STRONGLY

[Captioner] 21:11:08
 RECOMMEND THAT 
THE CITY COUNCIL ADOPT THIS PLAN 
AS WRITTEN

[Captioner] 21:11:12
.
I THINK THE CHALLENGE IS 
IMPLEMENTATION

[Captioner] 21:11:16
.
AND IMPLEMENTATION WILL TAKE A 
LONG TIME AND A LOT OF HARD 


[Captioner] 21:11:20
WORK.
AND I'D LIKE TO SEE THE CITY OF 
FREMONT TAKE A LEADERSHIP ROLE 


[Captioner] 21:11:25
IN THIS.
WE ARE A GREAT CITY AND I'D LIKE 
TO

[Captioner] 21:11:30
 SEE READ IN THE PAPER HOW THE 
CITY OF FREMONT IS

[Captioner] 21:11:34
 DOING 
EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO HELP 
FIGHT CLIMATE CHANGE.

[Captioner] 21:11:39

I THINK THE CHALLENGE IS THAT

[Captioner] 21:11:43
 WE 
NEED TO GET -- ALLOW THE CITY 
MANAGER THE POWER TO WORK WITH 


[Captioner] 21:11:47
ALL THE DEPARTMENTS THAT ARE 
DOING SOMETHING ABOUT CLIMATE 
CHANGE TO SUPPORT THIS

[Captioner] 21:11:52
 PLAN AND 
GIVE THE CITY MANAGER ALL THE 
SUPPORT AND POWER TO DO THAT

[Captioner] 21:11:57
.
ALSO IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THE 
CITY

[Captioner] 21:12:02
 COMMUNICATE WITH THE 
RESIDENTS OF FREMONT ABOUT ALL 
THE THINGS

[Captioner] 21:12:07
 THAT THEY 
INDIVIDUALLY CAN DO TO REDUCE

[Captioner] 21:12:11
 
THEIR IMPACT ON CLIMATE CHANGE

[Captioner] 21:12:14
 
AND ELECTRIFY THEIR HOME.
I THINK THE PROBLEM IS 


[Captioner] 21:12:19
EDUCATION, AND COMMUNICATION.
THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH THAT THE 
CITY CAN DO WITH

[Captioner] 21:12:24
 YOUR BUDGET, 
BUT YOU CAN DO A LOT MORE BY 
WORKING ON

[Captioner] 21:12:28
 YOUR WEBSITE, PUSHING 
THE GREEN CHALLENGE,

[Captioner] 21:12:32
 MORE, AND 
LETTING YOUR CITIZENS KNOW

[Captioner] 21:12:36
 
THERE'S MONEY TO BE USED FROM 
THE

[Captioner] 21:12:40
 INFLATION REDUCTION ACT AND 
LET'S GET IT DONE.
THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 21:12:45

>> The Clerk:   THANK YOU.
THE NEXT SPEAKER IS LISA

[Captioner] 21:12:49
 DANS 
FOLLOWED BY DANIELLE

[Captioner] 21:12:53
 
CARPELLOVICH.
>> GOOD EVENING, I'M LISA

[Captioner] 21:12:58
 DANS, 
I BELIEVE I PARTICIPATED IN JUST 
ABOUT EVERYTHING THAT

[Captioner] 21:13:02
 WAS ON 
RACHEL de FRAN

[Captioner] 21:13:06
CO'S LIST.
I THINK I OPTED UP THE MINI 
COULD.


[Captioner] 21:13:10
AS A RENTER THAT IS THE MAIN WAY 
THAT I CAN CHOOSE RENEWABLE 
ENERGY FOR

[Captioner] 21:13:15
 MY HOME SO I'M 
GRATEFUL FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO 
BE ABLE TO DO THAT AND EXCITE

[Captioner] 21:13:18
ED 
THAT THE OTHER RESIDENTS WILL 
HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY AS THEIR 


[Captioner] 21:13:22
DEFAULT.
I'M HERE TO SAY PLEASE DO 
SUPPORT

[Captioner] 21:13:27
 THE CAP, PLEASE SUPPORT 
THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION AS 
WRITTEN TO ADOPT

[Captioner] 21:13:31
 THE CLIMATE 
ACTION PLAN AND TO DIRECT AND 
SUPPORT STAFF IMPLEMENTING

[Captioner] 21:13:35
 IT 
WITH THE RESOURCES AND DIRECTION 
NEEDED ACROSS THE BOARD AS HAS 


[Captioner] 21:13:39
BEEN NOTED BY PREVIOUS SPEAKERS.
I'M GOING TO TAKE A MINUTE TO 
BRING

[Captioner] 21:13:43
 IT BACK TO WHY WE ALL CARE 
SO MUCH ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE IN 
THE FIRST PLACE.


[Captioner] 21:13:47
I KNOW THIS IS REVIEW BUT I 
THINK IT'S HELPFUL TO REMEMBER.
WE'RE ALL

[Captioner] 21:13:52
 IMPACTED, OUR HEALTH 
TODAY WITH THE CLIMATE IMPACTS

[Captioner] 21:13:56
 
THAT WE'VE FACED.
WE'VE HAD WILDFIRE SMOKE THIS

[Captioner] 21:14:00
 
YEAR, WE'VE HAD WORSE WILDFIRE 
SMOKE IN PREVIOUS YEARS,

[Captioner] 21:14:04
 I DON'T 
LIKE IT YOU DON'T LIKE IT, IT'S 
BAD FOR US NOW, IT'S

[Captioner] 21:14:08
 GOING TO BE 
WORSE IN THE FUTURE, IT'S 
ALREADY WORSE FOR FOLKS IN OTHER 


[Captioner] 21:14:13
PLACES NOT FAR FROM HERE AS WELL 
AS VERY FAR FROM HERE.
THIS IS A HUMAN RIGHTS

[Captioner] 21:14:17
 ISSUE AND 
IT'S A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR THE 
CITY OF FREMONT TO BE ABLE

[Captioner] 21:14:20
 TO DO 
ITS PART.
AND THE CLIMATE ACTION PLAN 


[Captioner] 21:14:24
REALLY GETS THAT.
IT REALLY ATTACKS THE ISSUES 
THAT THE CITY OF FREMONT HAS

[Captioner] 21:14:27
 IN 
ITS JURISDICTION TO BE ABLE TO 
DO.


[Captioner] 21:14:31
IT HAS THE RIGHT TARGETS, IT HAS 
THE RIGHT PROGRAMS

[Captioner] 21:14:35
.
AND I'M VERY EXCITED ABOUT THE 
CEQA STREAMLINING BECAUSE I 


[Captioner] 21:14:39
THINK THAT WILL REALLY HELP GOOD 
PROJECTS GET DONE MORE AND 
FASTER

[Captioner] 21:14:44
.
SO TO SUMMARIZE FROM MY LAST 
EIGHT SECONDS, PLEASE

[Captioner] 21:14:46
 SUPPORT 
STAFF RECOMMENDATION.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.


[Captioner] 21:14:52
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU 
MS. DANS LISA.
NEXT SPEAKER

[Captioner] 21:14:56
.
>> The Clerk:   DANIEL, FOLLOWED 
BY SHRAI

[Captioner] 21:15:00
A.
>> Mayor Mei:   WELCOME DANIEL

[Captioner] 21:15:05
.
>> HELLO AGAIN.
I'LL JUST START OFF WITH

[Captioner] 21:15:09
 SAYING 
YEAH, PASS THE PLAN AS WRITTEN 
OF COURSE.


[Captioner] 21:15:15
THAT IS THE OBVIOUS CHOICE, 
THERE'S NO REALLY DISCUSSION, 
THIS IS A GREAT PLAN

[Captioner] 21:15:19
.
I WILL SAY I WAS SURPRISED JUST 
HOW WELL ORGANIZED IT

[Captioner] 21:15:23
 WAS.
HAVING EACH SPECIFIC GOAL

[Captioner] 21:15:28
, EACH 
SPECIFIC ACTION, HAVE ITS OWN

[Captioner] 21:15:32
 
LITTLE ABBREVIATED CODE AND BE 
ORGANIZED BY CATEGORY MAKES IT 


[Captioner] 21:15:36
REAL EASY TO SEE WHERE YOU'RE 
DOING, SEE WHERE EVERYONE IS -- 
WHAT'S

[Captioner] 21:15:40
 BEING PRIORITIZED, IT'S 
GREAT.
BUT TO MAKE THIS A LITTLE BIT OF

[Captioner] 21:15:44
 
A COMPLIMENT SANDWICH I WILL 
JUST SAY, YOU KNOW,

[Captioner] 21:15:48
 THERE'S A 
LOT OF FOCUS ON GRATION 

[Captioner] 21:15:53
 GREENHOUSE GAS E

[Captioner] 21:15:57

EMISSIONS, I DON'T WANT TO GET 
FOCUSED AS THE

[Captioner] 21:16:02
 ONLY CAUSE OF 
CLIMATE CHANGE THE ONLY IMPACT 
OF CLIMATE CHANGE

[Captioner] 21:16:07
.
THERE IS OTHER THINGS WE CAN DO 
TO PREVENT

[Captioner] 21:16:11
 CLIMATE CHANGE AND 
HELP ADAPT TO IT.
THERE IS A LOT OF FOCUS ON EV'S

[Captioner] 21:16:14
.
I FIRST OF ALL JUST TO MAKE 
CLEAR I COMPLETELY AGREE EVERY 


[Captioner] 21:16:19
NEW VEHICLE SHOULD BE AN EV.
WE SHOULD, YOU KNOW, TRY TO 
REPLACE

[Captioner] 21:16:23
 GAS CARS AT THE END OF 
THEIR LIFE WITH EV'S BUT I

[Captioner] 21:16:27
 DON'T 
WANT TO CONFUSE THAT WHERE

[Captioner] 21:16:31
 
THINKING MORE EV'S IS BETTER.
LESS CARS IS BETTER FOR THE 


[Captioner] 21:16:35
ENVIRONMENT NO MATTER IF IT'S EV 
OR NOT.
IF WE

[Captioner] 21:16:39
 JUST MOVE THE 
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF CARS 
INSTEAD OF FROM THE TAIL

[Captioner] 21:16:43
 PIPE TO 
THE BATTERY FACTORY, THAT 
DOESN'T DO ANYTHING BECAUSE

[Captioner] 21:16:48
 WE 
ALL SHARE THE SAME ATMOSPHERE NO 
MATTER IF THE BATTERY FACTORY

[Captioner] 21:16:52
 IS 
IN CHINA, DOESN'T REALLY MATTER.
AND THERE IS A GOOD CHANCE THAT

[Captioner] 21:16:56
 
EV WAS MANUFACTURED IN TREATMENT 
BECAUSE WE HAVE A TESLA

[Captioner] 21:16:59
 FACTORY 
HERE.
JUST TO CLOSE OUT, PASS THE PLAN 


[Captioner] 21:17:03
BUT WE CAN DO A LITTLE BIT 
BETTER NEXT TIME.
THANK YOU

[Captioner] 21:17:08

ON THE SUSTAINABILITY

[Captioner] 21:17:23
 
COMMISSION.
I WANT TO EARTHQUAKE OWE WHAT 


[Captioner] 21:17:27
OTHERS HAVE SAID AND EXPRESS MY 
SUPPORT FOR THE FINAL

[Captioner] 21:17:30
 ADOPTION 
OF THE CLIMATE ACTION PLAN BY 
THE CITY COUNCIL.


[Captioner] 21:17:35
FIRST IT CONTAINS MEASURES THAT 
ARE

[Captioner] 21:17:41
 SUSTAINABLE, IN THE BAY AREA 
AND BEYOND.
IT IS A SURPRISE TO IN ONE THAT

[Captioner] 21:17:44
 
I'M MOST EXCITED ABOUT THE 
MEASURES ABOUT GRAY WATER USE, 


[Captioner] 21:17:49
INCREASING THE AMOUNT OF GRAY 
WATER USE THAT WE DO IS CRUCIAL 
TO MAKE FREMONT

[Captioner] 21:17:53
 DROUGHT 
RESILIENT SO I'M GLAD THERE'S 
MEASURES IN THE PLAN

[Captioner] 21:17:57
 AND I'M 
HAPPY TO TALK TO ANYONE WHO IS 
INTERESTED

[Captioner] 21:18:01
 IN THAT MORE.
I WANT TO TOUCH ON SOMETHING 
THAT THE

[Captioner] 21:18:06
 VALUES THAT THE VALUES 
INCLUDE EQUITY

[Captioner] 21:18:10
 AND ACCESS 
ENSURING THAT EVERYONE HAS THE 
OPPORTUNITY TO

[Captioner] 21:18:14
 BENEFIT EQUALLY 
FROM CLIMATE SOLUTIONS, 
EFFICIENCY AND

[Captioner] 21:18:19
 I

[Captioner] 21:18:23
 INNOVATION.
SAFEGUARDING AND ENHANCING OUR 
ABILITY TO LIVE WORK PLAY

[Captioner] 21:18:26
 AND 
CONNECT IN THIS COMMUNITY THAT 
WE ALL LOVE.


[Captioner] 21:18:30
AS WELL AS RESILIENCY AND 
CAPACITY BUILDING, PROVIDING 
EDUCATION AND TRAINING

[Captioner] 21:18:35
, TO BUILD 
A MORE RESILIENT AND SUSTAINABLE 
FUTURE

[Captioner] 21:18:38
.
SO IMPLEMENTING THESE 
RECOMMENDATION IS REALLY WHERE 


[Captioner] 21:18:42
WE WILL SEE MOST OF THESE 
BENEFITS AND WHERE WE WILL SEE 
THE EMISSIONS REDUCTION HE

[Captioner] 21:18:47
 THAT 
OUR SUSTAINABILITY MANAGER HAS 
ALREADY PLAYED OUT

[Captioner] 21:18:50
.
I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THESE 
BEING ADOPTED BY THE CITY 


[Captioner] 21:18:55
COUNCIL BUT THAT IS WHERE THE 
REAL WORK WILL BEGIN.
I'M EXCITED TO SEE THIS

[Captioner] 21:18:59
 BEING 
ADOPTED AND EXCITED TO SEIZE 
THIS PLAN BEING USED

[Captioner] 21:19:03
 AS A BASIS 
UPON WHICH WE CAN BUILD SO 
ACTIONS MAY BE

[Captioner] 21:19:06
 TAKEN MOVING 
FORWARD.

[Captioner] 21:19:19
GOOD EVENING, MY NAME IS WILLIAM 
UREG

[Captioner] 21:19:23
I REPRESENTING THE SIERRA 
CLUB.
WE ARE THE

[Captioner] 21:19:28
 OLDEST ENVIRONMENTAL 
ORGANIZATION IN THE UNITED 
STATES ACTIVELY INVOLVED

[Captioner] 21:19:32
 IN 
ACTIONS OF THIS TYPE THROUGHOUT 
THE COUNTRY IN TERMS OF CLIMATE 


[Captioner] 21:19:36
ACTION PLANS.
CLIMATE ACTION PLANS ARE -- 
THEY'RE A DETAILED

[Captioner] 21:19:40
 PROPOSAL FOR 
DOING OR ACHIEVING SOMETHING AND 
THIS PLAN

[Captioner] 21:19:45
 HAS ENOUGH DETAILS AND 
ENOUGH OFNTS THAT YOU CAN

[Captioner] 21:19:48
 
ACTUALLY PUT STAKES IN THE 
GROUND AND THEN PULL TOWARDS 


[Captioner] 21:19:50
THEM.
SO WE'RE SUPPORTIVE OF THIS 
PLAN.


[Captioner] 21:19:54
SURE THERE COULD BE MORE DETAILS 
AND THERE COULD BE MORE STAKES 
IN THE GROUND.


[Captioner] 21:19:58
BUT YOU START SOMEWHERE AND THEN 
YOU FINISH SOMEWHERE ELSE.
AND SO

[Captioner] 21:20:02
 WE'RE SUPPORTIVE OF THE 
PLAN.
JUST PERSONALLY

[Captioner] 21:20:07
 I'VE LIVED IN 
FREMONT SINCE 1983 
APPROXIMATELY, SOME 40

[Captioner] 21:20:11
 YEARS.
AND THIS CITY HAS CHANGED.
IT HAS BECOME GREENER

[Captioner] 21:20:15
.
I WOULD LOVE TO SEE MORE 
WALKWAYS, MORE

[Captioner] 21:20:19
 PEDESTRIAN 
PATHWAYS, MORE BICYCLE PATHS.
YOU CAN'T ENCOURAGE PARENTS TO

[Captioner] 21:20:23
 
PUT THEIR KIDS IN BICYCLES IF 
THE KIDS ARE IN THE STREET GET

[Captioner] 21:20:27

GETTING HIT BY CARS.
WE HAVE TO FIND MORE PATHS TO 


[Captioner] 21:20:31
PEDESTRIAN WALKWAYS IN THE CITY 
AND BY THE WAY WHEN YOU DO THAT 
YOU'LL HAVE MORE

[Captioner] 21:20:36
 GREEN TREES SO 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU

[Captioner] 21:20:40
.

[Captioner] 21:20:43

WELCOME KELLY.
>> AND THEN THE LAST SPEAKER 


[Captioner] 21:20:47
WILL BE CAROLINE HARRIS.
>> SO YEAH,

[Captioner] 21:20:52
 I SUPPORT THE PLAN.
BUT

[Captioner] 21:20:56
 AS FAR AS HOW THE PLAN IS 
BEING OVER

[Captioner] 21:21:00
SEEN, AND MONITORED 
OVER TIME

[Captioner] 21:21:04
, YOU KNOW, I SEE SOME 
WEAKNESSES THERE WHERE, YOU 
KNOW,

[Captioner] 21:21:09
 YOU'RE NOT LOOKING AT IT 
EVERY YEAR AND SAYING

[Captioner] 21:21:11
 ARE WE 
PROCEEDING ACCORDING TO 
SCHEDULE.


[Captioner] 21:21:15
I THINK THIS IS WHAT EVERY FIVE 
YEARS OR SOMETHING?
BECAUSE IT'S A LOT OF WORK

[Captioner] 21:21:19
.
MAYBE -- SO THAT'S A LITTLE BIT,

[Captioner] 21:21:23
 
YOU REALLY AREN'T FOLLOWING 
ALONG CHECKING THE

[Captioner] 21:21:27
 SPEEDOMETER 
TO SEE OR CHECKING THE MILE 
POSTS AS

[Captioner] 21:21:32
 YOU ARE GOING ALONG.
ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF

[Captioner] 21:21:36
 THERE'S SOME 
INCONGRUITIES IN FOR EXAMPLE THE 
WATER FORECAST

[Captioner] 21:21:40
.
PEOPLE WILL COME AND TELL YOU OH 
YEAH WE'RE GOING TO DROP THE 


[Captioner] 21:21:44
WATER USE, EACH HOUSEHOLD IS 
GOING TO DROP ITS WATER USE BY A 
CERTAIN

[Captioner] 21:21:48
 AMOUNT.
WHICH IS PROBABLY PERFECTLY 
REALISTIC.


[Captioner] 21:21:52
BUT IF WE LOOK AT ALL THESE 
WATER DISTRICTS, OURS AND

[Captioner] 21:21:56
 
EVERYBODY ELSE'S THEY ARE ALL

[Captioner] 21:22:00
 
FORECASTING STEAD GROWTH OVER 
LONG TERM

[Captioner] 21:22:05
.
THEY HAVE ALL BEEN WRONG ABOUT 
THAT BECAUSE

[Captioner] 21:22:09
 OVERALL WATER USE 
HAS BEEN DROPPING.
THEY HAVE THIS HABIT OF PUTTING 


[Captioner] 21:22:13
OUT ROSY FORECAST AND THEN 
ACTUALLY SEEING WATER

[Captioner] 21:22:17
 
CONSERVATION TAKE HOLD HARDER 
AND STRONGER THAN THEY EXPECTED

[Captioner] 21:22:21
.
ELECTRICITY PRICE INCREASES SAME 
THING.


[Captioner] 21:22:25
THERE ARE HUGE PRICE INCREASES 
FOR ELECTRICITY IN THE PIPELINE, 
HUGE REGARDLESS OF

[Captioner] 21:22:29
 THIS PLAN.
AND I'M SURE THAT THE IMPACTS OF 
THAT ARE NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD AND

[Captioner] 21:22:34
 
PEOPLE -- SO THESE ACTIVITIES 
ARE NOT GOING

[Captioner] 21:22:38
 TO BE PAINLESS, 
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE LOW 
EFFORT, THEY ARE NOT GOING

[Captioner] 21:22:43
 TO BE 
UNOBTRUSIVE, THEY ARE NOT GOING

[Captioner] 21:22:47
 
TO BE TECHNOLOGICAL MIRACLES AND 
THERE WILL BE SOME PAIN HERE.


[Captioner] 21:22:53
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.
WELCOME CAROLINE.


[Captioner] 21:23:01
>> HI, MY NAME IS CAROLINE 
HARRIS.
I'M A LONG TERM,

[Captioner] 21:23:05
 20 YEARS 
RESIDENT OF IRVINGTON.
I ALSO HAPPEN TO BE THE

[Captioner] 21:23:09
 CURRENT 
CHAIR OF THE TRICITY ECOLOGY 
CENTER.


[Captioner] 21:23:14
I'M PASSIONATE OF THE 
ENVIRONMENT WHICH IS WHY I'M 
PART

[Captioner] 21:23:18
 OF THE TRICITY ENVIRONMENT 
CENTER AND WHY I'M HERE NOW.

[Captioner] 21:23:21

WE HAVE GOT TO CHANGE THE 
PERCEPTION OF THE PEOPLE THAT 


[Captioner] 21:23:26
IT'S IN THEIR HANDS TO USE LESS 
VEHICLES, TO DRIVE

[Captioner] 21:23:30
 LESS, TO 
ENCOURAGE THE KIDS TO WALK TO 
SCHOOL TO DRIVE TO SCHOOL

[Captioner] 21:23:34
, IT'S 
REALLY ABOUT THE EDUCATION, 
ABOUT THE PERCEPTION, WE

[Captioner] 21:23:38
 NEED TO 
PICK UP THE CONVENIENCE FACTOR 
OF GRABBING

[Captioner] 21:23:42
 UP A PLASTIC

[Captioner] 21:23:47
 BOTTLE, 
USING IT AND THROWING IT AWAY.
THEIR

[Captioner] 21:23:51
 DAILY LIVES, I AGREE WITH 
JENNY WE HAVE GOT TO HAVE TIME 
LINES OF WHEN THINGS

[Captioner] 21:23:55
 ARE GOING 
TO HAPPEN TO ACHIEVE THESE 
GOALS.


[Captioner] 21:23:59
I THINK IT'S QUITE DISAPPOINTING 
THAT EVEN THOUGH WE GOT THIS 
PLAN WE KNOW WE

[Captioner] 21:24:03
 HAVE GOT TO FAIL 
BY 2044

[Captioner] 21:24:07
, 2045, BECAUSE WE'RE 
HOPING FOR A MIRACLE ON THE

[Captioner] 21:24:11
 
STATE AND FEDERAL LEVEL.
OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH.


[Captioner] 21:24:14
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.
AND AT THIS TIME I'M GOING TO 
CLOSE THE PUBLIC COMMENT.

TWO POINTS, ONE WAS RAISED

MR. ABREW ABOUT COMING BACK, I 
THINK YOU SAID THIS WOULD COME

[Captioner] 21:24:33
 
BACK IN THREE YEARS WE WOULD 
LOOK AT IT WHAT THE FREQUENCY OF 


[Captioner] 21:24:38
LOOKING AT THE CLIMATE ACTION 
PLAN.
>> YES, SO THE GOAL IS

[Captioner] 21:24:43
 TO FOCUS 
ON IMPLEMENTATION OF THE 
MEASURES OR ACTION HE WITHIN THE

[Captioner] 21:24:46
 
GAME PLAN OVER THE NEXT THREE 
YEARS.


[Captioner] 21:24:50
AND AFTER THREE YEARS OF 
IMPLEMENTATION, YOU KNOW, COMING 
BACK TO

[Captioner] 21:24:54
 UPDATE THE GAME PLAN, 
AND LOOKING AT, YOU KNOW, 
WHATEVER

[Captioner] 21:24:59
 OTHER ACTIONS THAT WE 
HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO UNDERTAKE 
AT THAT POINT

[Captioner] 21:25:04
 THAT WE COULD 
FOCUS ON MOVING FORWARD.
THAT SAID,

[Captioner] 21:25:09
 THERE IS, YOU KNOW, A 
SHORT TERM PRIORITY 
IMPLEMENTATION ACTION WITHIN THE

[Captioner] 21:25:13
 
GAME PLAN TO ESTABLISH CLIMATE

[Captioner] 21:25:17
 
READY TREATMENT DASHBOARD THAT 
WOULD PROVIDE

[Captioner] 21:25:20
, YOU KNOW, UPDATES 
ON THE PLAN IMPLEMENTATION 
PROGRESS.


[Captioner] 21:25:24
AND TRACK KEY PERFORMANCE 
INDICATORS AS BEST AS POSSIBLE 
TO BE ABLE TO

[Captioner] 21:25:29
 SHOW HOW WE ARE 
DOING ALONG THE WAY.
WE DO

[Captioner] 21:25:34
 REGULAR GREENHOUSE 
INVENTORY

[Captioner] 21:25:38
 UPDATES BUT THIS WOULD 
FOCUS A LITTLE MORE DETAIL IN 
TERMS OF WHAT ARE THE ADOPTION

[Captioner] 21:25:42
 
RATES OF RENEWABLE ENERGY FOR 
INSTANCE,

[Captioner] 21:25:47
 HOW MANY HOMES HAVE 
INSTALLED SOLAR, HOW ARE WE 
DOING

[Captioner] 21:25:51
 IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO 
TRACK THAT IN A

[Captioner] 21:25:55
 MORE REGULAR 
FASHION AND BE ABLE TO PRODUCE 
REPORTS OUT OF THAT AS WELL, 


[Captioner] 21:26:00
THAT WE CAN SHARE WITH THE 
SUSTAINABILITY

[Captioner] 21:26:02
 COMMISSION AND 
WITH THE COIMENT.
>> Councilmember Salwan:   THANK 


[Captioner] 21:26:06
YOU, I LIKE THE DASHBOARD, I 
THINK THAT'S FANTASTIC.
YOU HAVE

[Captioner] 21:26:11
 DONE GREAT WORK, ALL OF 
THE FOLKS HERE ARE SUPPORTIVE

[Captioner] 21:26:15
 OF 
THIS, COUNCIL IS SUPPORTIVE OF 
IT SO I WOULD LIKE

[Captioner] 21:26:19
 TO MOVE THIS 
FORWARD, MOVE ADOPTION OF THE

[Captioner] 21:26:22
 
RECOMMENDATION.
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU, 


[Captioner] 21:26:25
COUNCILMEMBER KENG.
>> Councilmember Keng:   THANK 
YOU, MAYOR.


[Captioner] 21:26:29
FREMONT HAS BEEN A LEADER IN THE 
ENVIRONMENT AND SUSTAIN

[Captioner] 21:26:33
ABLE 
ACTION AND WE RECOGNIZE AS

[Captioner] 21:26:37
 SUCH, 
WE ARE RACING WITH TIME ON 
CLIMATE ACTION AND WE

[Captioner] 21:26:41
 NEED TO BE 
AGGRESSIVE IN OUR CLIMATE ACTION 
GOALS AND POLICIES.


[Captioner] 21:26:45
SO I REALLY COMMEND ALL YOUR 
EFFORT AND GREAT WORK

[Captioner] 21:26:49
 IN 
REACHING THIS MILESTONE WITH OUR 
NEW CLIMATE ACTION PLAN.

[Captioner] 21:26:53

AND I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS -- I 
WOULD MOVE THIS

[Captioner] 21:26:57
 FORWARD AND TO 
BE ADOPTED.


[Captioner] 21:27:02
THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei:   SO ARE YOU 
SECONDING THE MOTION

[Captioner] 21:27:05
?
>> Councilmember Keng:   I WILL.
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 21:27:08
COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL.
>> Councilmember Campbell:   
ACTUALLY I WAS GOING TO SECOND 


[Captioner] 21:27:12
THE MOTION.
>> Mayor Mei:   OKAY THAT'S 
PERFECT.


[Captioner] 21:27:15
>> Councilmember Campbell:   
BECAUSE I REALLY DO THINK THIS 
IS A GREAT PLAN AND YOU'VE DONE 


[Captioner] 21:27:20
SOME FABULOUS WORK ON IT.
I AM CONCERNED, AS SOME OF THE 
COUNCILMEMBERS

[Captioner] 21:27:24
 HAVE ALLUDED TO, 
THE SOMETIME LINE IN TERMS OF 
BEING ABLE --

[Captioner] 21:27:29
 THE TIME LINE IN 
TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO GET, I 
KNOW YOU HAVE

[Captioner] 21:27:33
 YOUR FIRST YEAR 
PRIORITIES, IT WOULD BE ABLE TO 
SEE THAT HAVE

[Captioner] 21:27:37
 MADE SOME 
MILESTONES AS TO WHERE YOU ARE 
WITHIN THE, YOU KNOW, SIX MONTH

[Captioner] 21:27:41
, 
EIGHT MONTH, 12 MONTH OR 
WHATEVER THAT THAT PERIOD MIGHT 


[Captioner] 21:27:45
BE, TO HELP ENSURE THAT WE MIGHT 
BE ABLE TO GET THERE.
I'M VERY INTEREST

[Captioner] 21:27:49
ED IN THE GRAY 
WATER AND HOW WE'RE GOING TO BE 
ABLE TO DO THAT.


[Captioner] 21:27:54
I DID HAVE ONE OTHER THING THAT 
I DIDN'T MENTION EARLIER, WAS 
ABOUT

[Captioner] 21:27:58
 THE COMPOST HUBS.
ARE THESE GOING TO BE SOMETHING 
THAT ARE GOING TO

[Captioner] 21:28:02
 BE REGULATED?
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, WE HAVE THESE -- WE

[Captioner] 21:28:06
 HAVE HAD THESE 
LITTLE BINS SITTING OUT WHERE 
PEOPLE COULD PUT

[Captioner] 21:28:10
 CLOTHES IN IT 
AND SHOES AND ALL THIS OTHER 
KIND OF STUFF AND THEN IT

[Captioner] 21:28:14
 WAS 
RUNNING OVER.
I CAN ENVISION THESE COMPOST 


[Captioner] 21:28:18
HUBS BEING A PLACE WHERE WE 
MIGHT GET SOME LITTLE PESTS THAT 
WE MIGHT

[Captioner] 21:28:22
 NOT WANT TO HAVE TO 
DEAL WITH.
BECAUSE I KNOW MY COMPOST BIN AT 


[Captioner] 21:28:27
HOME CAN GET A LITTLE, YOU KNOW.
SO IS

[Captioner] 21:28:31
 THERE A PLAN TO HAVE THESE 
REGULATED OR WHAT

[Captioner] 21:28:35
 -- OR TREATED?
>> THERE IS SUPPOSED

[Captioner] 21:28:40
 TO BE A 
LOCATION TO BE ABLE TO PICK UP 
COMPOST

[Captioner] 21:28:44
 AND MULCH THAT'S BEEN 
ALREADY PROCESSED NOT TO DROP 
OFF FOOD

[Captioner] 21:28:47
 SO IF THAT HELPS ANSWER 
THE QUESTION.
THE OTHER THING IS THAT THERE IS 


[Captioner] 21:28:52
SOME EXAMPLES IN SOME OF THE 
OTHER CITIES IN ALAMEDA COUNTY 
WHERE THEY PARTNERED

[Captioner] 21:28:55
 WITH LOCAL 
NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS, 
ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE FOCUSED 


[Captioner] 21:29:00
ON COMMUNITY GARDENING TRINS, TO 
BE ABLE TO ESTABLISH THESE TYPES 
OF LOCATIONS

[Captioner] 21:29:04
 FOR PEOPLE TO COME 
AND ACCESS THAT FREE COMPOST.
>> Councilmember Campbell:   


[Captioner] 21:29:08
OKAY, MY BAD.
I THOUGHT WE WERE LIKE LETTING

[Captioner] 21:29:12
 
PEOPLE BRING THEIR COMPOST IN.
>> WE WOULD LIKE THEM TO

[Captioner] 21:29:15
 PUT IT 
IN THEIR GREEN BINS.
>> Councilmember Campbell:   


[Captioner] 21:29:19
OKAY, I SUPPORT THIS THANK YOU 
SO MUCH.
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU WE 


[Captioner] 21:29:23
HAVE A MOTION AND SECOND.
I WILL RUN THROUGH MY BULLETS.
I WANT TO

[Captioner] 21:29:27
 THANK EVERYBODY WHO 
CAME OUT, I'M PROUD OF SOME OF 
OUR YOUTH TAKING CHARGE

[Captioner] 21:29:32
 AND 
TAKING LEADERSHIP SO WHETHER 
IT'S THROUGH OUR

[Captioner] 21:29:36
 INTERNATIONAL 
WALK AND ROLL DAY, OR TO MOVE 
THROUGH THAT TRANSPORTATION

[Captioner] 21:29:40
, I 
KNOW DANIELLE I SAW YOU AT SOME 
OF THE BIKE

[Captioner] 21:29:44
 RIDES TOO.
THE MORE WE CAN GET PEOPLE TO 
ADOPT AND BE

[Captioner] 21:29:48
 OUR AMBASSADORS, WE 
CAN'T DO THIS ALONE.
THE MORE WE CAN GET

[Captioner] 21:29:52
 OUR 
COMMISSIONERS OR PEOPLE IN OUR 
COMMUNITY, ESPECIALLY OUR 


[Captioner] 21:29:57
STUDENTS, TO BE OUR AMBASSADORS, 
THAT MAKES A HUGE DIFFERENCE.
OUR

[Captioner] 21:30:01
 GREEN CHALLENGE THUZ LETTER 
AND ALL THESE TIPS THAT GO OUT, 
PEOPLE TO ADOPT

[Captioner] 21:30:05
 IT WILL MAKE A 
HUGE DIFFERENCE.
SECOND AGAIN WITH OUR 


[Captioner] 21:30:09
MANUFACTURERS, WE HAVE SUCH A 
HUGE BASE, WE HAVE THE

[Captioner] 21:30:13
 LARGEST 
MANUFACTURERS IN CALIFORNIA FOR 
ADVANCE MANUFACTURING.

[Captioner] 21:30:16

THAT WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE.
I SUPPORT ABSOLUTELY THE 


[Captioner] 21:30:20
DASHBOARD.
MANY YEARS AGO, COUNCILMEMBER 
CAMPBELL AND I WE HAD SOME FOR 


[Captioner] 21:30:24
THE SCHOOL BOARD AND WHAT YOU 
COULD SEE IS WE COULD CREATE A 
LIST OF METRICS AND

[Captioner] 21:30:29
 I THINK IT 
HELPS TO FOCUS AS WE CHIEF

[Captioner] 21:30:33
 THE 
GOALS WE WANT TO SEE WHETHER 
IT'S THE ADOPTION OF

[Captioner] 21:30:37
 THE RIGHT 
CHOICE, NOT THE RIGHT CHOICE, 
THE CLEAN RENEWABLE

[Captioner] 21:30:42
 100 SORRY, 
I'VE BEEN UP SINCE 5:30

[Captioner] 21:30:45
, THE 
RENEWABLE 100 AND ALL THESE 
OTHER THINGS.


[Captioner] 21:30:49
I THINK WE COULD MOVE TOWARDS 
UPDATING THEM AND TAKING THEM 
OFF AND ADOPT

[Captioner] 21:30:53
ING NEW ONES.
BUT EVEN IF WE START WITH A CORE 
OF

[Captioner] 21:30:57
 15 OR 20 OF THESE GOALS, I 
THINK YOU CAN TRACK THE PROGRESS 
AND WE NEED THE

[Captioner] 21:31:01
 ADOPTION OF 
EVERYONE FOR THAT.
WE HAVE A MOTION AND SECOND AND 


[Captioner] 21:31:05
IF WE COULD ALL HAVE -- OOPS

[Captioner] 21:31:09
 DO 
YOU HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION?

[Captioner] 21:31:12

>> Vice Mayor Cox:   I JUST HAVE 
A QUESTION, BEFORE WE VOTE I 


[Captioner] 21:31:16
WANT TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE A 
QUESTION ANSWERED.
AS YOU

[Captioner] 21:31:20
 ROLL OUT THE DASHBOARD 
WHAT IS THE ESTIMATED TIME 
PERIOD THAT IT WOULD BE

[Captioner] 21:31:23
 UP AND 
RUNNING?
BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE A SENSE OF 


[Captioner] 21:31:27
WHERE WE STAND AT ANY -- IS IT 
LIVE THAT IT BE UPDATED BUT WHEN

[Captioner] 21:31:31
 
DO YOU THINK THAT WOULD HAPPEN 
AND HOW OFTEN WOULD IT BE 


[Captioner] 21:31:35
UPDATED AFTER?
>> I'M HOPING TO GET THAT GOING 
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.


[Captioner] 21:31:39
YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO GO THROUGH 
PROCESS OF SELECTING A

[Captioner] 21:31:42
 FIRM TO 
SUPPORT IT.
>> Vice Mayor Cox:   YOU HAVEN'T 


[Captioner] 21:31:46
HAD THAT SELECTION YET?
>> NO WE HAVEN'T.
WE HAVE TALKED TO A COUPLE OF 


[Captioner] 21:31:50
GROUPS ABOUT WHAT THEY OFFER IN 
TERMS OF THEIR PRODUCTS.
THERE AREN'T THAT MANY OUT

[Captioner] 21:31:54
 THERE 
AND HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING OF, 
YOU KNOW, WHAT WOULD WORK

[Captioner] 21:31:58
 FOR 
THE CITY.
AND

[Captioner] 21:32:02
, YOU KNOW, THE TIME FRAME IS 

[Captioner] 21:32:07
 
AT THIS POINT, NOW THAT WE HAVE 
ADOPTION, ONE OF THE

[Captioner] 21:32:11
 THINGS I'D 
LIKE TO FOCUS ON IN THE COMING 
MONTHS IS MOVING FORWARD AND 


[Captioner] 21:32:16
SETTLING UP A CONTRACT FOR THAT 
WORK AND THEN GETTING A 
DASHBOARD UP AND GOING

[Captioner] 21:32:18
.
>> Vice Mayor Cox:   YOU DIDN'T 
REALLY ANSWER THE QUESTION 


[Captioner] 21:32:23
BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE AN IDEA OF 
WHEN THAT WOULD GO LIVE.
IF YOU HAVEN'T

[Captioner] 21:32:27
 GONE OUT FOR 
SOLICITATION YET WHICH COULD 
TAKE A YEAR OR TWO DEPENDING

[Captioner] 21:32:31
 ON 
HOW COMPLEX IT IS.
OR COULD YOU ASK A

[Captioner] 21:32:35
 LITTLE --

[Captioner] 21:32:39

>> IT WOULD PROBABLY TAKE A FEW 
MONTHS, FOUR TO SIX I WOULD 


[Captioner] 21:32:43
GUESS.
>> Vice Mayor Cox:   OKAY.
SO THEN YOU'RE PROBABLY LOOKING 


[Captioner] 21:32:47
AT A YEAR, LESS THAN A YEAR, TO 
HAVE THE DASHBOARD READY?
I'M JUST

[Captioner] 21:32:51
 TRYING TO ENGAGE SO I 
CAN UNDERSTAND IF WE APPROVE 
THIS, I DON'T WANT TO HAVE

[Captioner] 21:32:54
 TO 
SEE THE FINAL RESULTS IN THREE 
YEARS.


[Captioner] 21:32:58
BUT SEE SOME SORT OF LIVE 
DATA --

[Captioner] 21:33:05

>> Dan Schoenholz:   I DON'T 
THINK IT WOULD TAKE US FOUR TO 


[Captioner] 21:33:09
SIX MONTHS, I THINK IT WOULD 
TAKE US FOUR TO SIX MONTHS TO 
GET THE DASHBOARD

[Captioner] 21:33:13
 STARTED.
>> Vice Mayor Cox:   TO GET THE 
IMPLEMENTATION

[Captioner] 21:33:18
?
>> Dan Schoenholz:   I'D SAY IN 
THE SPRING WE WOULD BE

[Captioner] 21:33:22
 UP AND 
FOCUSED TO HAVE

[Captioner] 21:33:25
 IT RUNNING.
>> Vice Mayor Cox:   I'M SURE 
YOU WILL.


[Captioner] 21:33:29
I JUST WANTED TO GET A GAUGE A 
LITTLE BIT WHERE WE WERE IN THE

[Captioner] 21:33:33
 
PROCESS BEFORE WE TAKE A VOTE SO 
THAT WOULD HELP ME TO MAKE THE 


[Captioner] 21:33:37
DECISION.
OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
>> Mayor Mei:   SO WE HAVE A

[Captioner] 21:33:39
 
MOTION AND SECOND.
IF WE COULD PLEASE CALL THE 


[Captioner] 21:33:44
VOTE.
THANK YOU.
SO

[Captioner] 21:33:48
 CONGRATULATIONS.
THE CLIMATE PLAN IS ADOPTED 
UNANIMOUSLY.

[Captioner] 21:33:52

AND I'M SURE COUNCILMEMBER SHAO 
WHO IS ABSENT TODAY

[Captioner] 21:33:56
 WOULD BE 
INTERESTED IN SUPPORTING.
BUT AT THIS TIME

[Captioner] 21:33:59
, I THINK THAT 
WAS THE LAST OF OUR AGENDA ITEMS 
THIS EVENING.


[Captioner] 21:34:04
I WANT TO THANK ALL THE SPEAKERS 
WHO HAVE COME AND WHO HAVE 
PARTICIPATED

[Captioner] 21:34:09
, AND I ENCOURAGE 
PEOPLE TO HELP US PARTICIPATE IN

[Captioner] 21:34:13
 
THE NEXT PIECE OF IT WHICH IS 
THE ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION DEMAND

[Captioner] 21:34:17
 
PLAN AS WELL AS JUST IN GENERAL 
FOLLOWING ALONG WITH OUR CLIMATE

[Captioner] 21:34:21
 
ACTION NEWSLETTERS IN OUR 
COMMISSIONS, SO AGAIN ALL OF YOU

[Captioner] 21:34:25
 
THE MORE YOU SPREAD THE 
AWARENESS WHETHER IT IS THROUGH 


[Captioner] 21:34:29
CO-HOUSING OR SOME OF THESE 
TRICITY ECOLOGY AND OTHER

[Captioner] 21:34:31
 GROUPS 
I THINK IT'S A GREAT 
OPPORTUNITY.


[Captioner] 21:34:35
IS THERE ANY REPORTS OUT ON 
COMMITTEE ASSIGNMENTS AT THIS 
TIME?


[Captioner] 21:34:42
I'LL JUST GIVE A QUICK REPORT 
OUT ON A COUPLE OF ITEMS.
ONE, I WANT

[Captioner] 21:34:46
 TO THANK ALL THE 
MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY FOR 
PARTICIPATE

[Captioner] 21:34:50
ING.
LAST FRIDAY WE HAD THE COOLEST

[Captioner] 21:34:53
 
MANUFACTURED PRODUCT MADE IN 
CALIFORNIA, IT WAS THE FIRST 


[Captioner] 21:34:58
TIME THEY'D EVER HAD THAT AND I 
WANT TO THANK OUR ECONOMIC 
DEVELOPMENT TEAM

[Captioner] 21:35:02
 AND ALL THE 
MANUFACTURERS IN OUR CITY.
OF THE 16 ORIGINAL FINALIST

[Captioner] 21:35:06
S, 
THREE OF THEM CAME THERE FREMONT 
AND SO

[Captioner] 21:35:11
 THERE'S BOEHRIN

[Captioner] 21:35:15
GER 
INGELHEI

[Captioner] 21:35:19
M.
AND THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR TO 
FRERCHT

[Captioner] 21:35:23
 THE AWARD TO TESLA, IT 
IS VERY GOOD TO

[Captioner] 21:35:27
 SEE THAT IS A 
RECOGNITION FOR OUR CITY.
I WANT TO ENCOURAGE, WE

[Captioner] 21:35:31
 TALKED 
ABOUT INNOVATION AND 
OPPORTUNITIES, THEY ARE GETTING

[Captioner] 21:35:36
 
READY FOR THE NEXT ROUND I HOPE

[Captioner] 21:35:40
 
THAT WE CAN PARTICIPATE WITH THE 
COMPANIES AND THE IDEAS.

[Captioner] 21:35:44

THE IDEAS DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE 
TO BE

[Captioner] 21:35:48
 HIGH TECH EITHER.
ONE WAS A POPCORN MANUFACTURER

[Captioner] 21:35:52
 
IN SACRAMENTO.
IT CAN BE TASTY AND MANY WAYS TO 


[Captioner] 21:35:57
HELP US NEED THE OPPORTUNITIES 
AND IDEAS AS WELL AS OUR SOULS.
SO I WOULD LIKE

[Captioner] 21:36:00
 TO ASK A FAVOR 
AT THIS POINT.
I KNOW THIS HAS BEEN A REALLY 


[Captioner] 21:36:06
DIFFICULT WEEK THE PAST COUPLE 
OF WEEKS FOR MANY DIFFERENT 
REASONS

[Captioner] 21:36:10
, WE'VE HAD LOSSES ACROSS 
THE GLOBE FROM NATIONAL 
DISASTERS

[Captioner] 21:36:14
 AND MAN MADE ONES.
I'D LIKE US TO PAUSE AND END ON 
A MOMENT

[Captioner] 21:36:18
 OF SILENCE.
[ MOMENT OF SILENCE ]

[Captioner] 21:36:30

>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU VERY 
MUCH.


[Captioner] 21:36:35
AND I'D ASK ALL OF YOU TO GO AND 
BE WELL, BE SAFE,

[Captioner] 21:36:37
 BE JUST AND BE 
KIND.
THANKS.
