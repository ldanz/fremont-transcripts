 THE CITY COUNCIL HAS RECENTLY


[Captioner] 19:23:34
PASSED MORE ORDINANCES, I


[Captioner] 19:23:38
THOUGHT I'D CALL OUT HOW
ORDINANCES

[Captioner] 19:23:41
 EITHER NEED UPDATES
OR TO NOT BE

[Captioner] 19:23:45
 USED WHEN IN CITY


[Captioner] 19:23:49
DOCUMENTS.
I SEE A LOT OF DOCUMENTS THAT
SEEM TO

[Captioner] 19:23:55
 CALL OUT MUNICIPAL CODES
FOR FUNDING WITH

[Captioner] 19:23:58
 EXCEPTIONS, BUTTHE EXCEPTIONS DON'T

[Captioner] 19:24:02
 ACTUALLY
MATCH WHAT IT

[Captioner] 19:24:06
 IS.
I'M ACTUALLY SPEAKING ABOUT
WHAT'S CONSIDERED, I

[Captioner] 19:24:09
 THINK, THE
PUBLIC PURCHASING

[Captioner] 19:24:15
 CODES, THE
CITY OF FREMONT 3.20.280.


[Captioner] 19:24:19
 3.20.280 IS THE
SPECIFIC SECTION, AND IN THAT


[Captioner] 19:24:22
SECTION,

[Captioner] 19:24:27
 SUBSECTION C, WHAT THE
SUBSECTION IDENTIFIES IS
EXEMPTIONS

[Captioner] 19:24:33
 FROM CERTAIN
CONTRACTS.
THIS IS FOR SOFTWARE UPDATES AND


[Captioner] 19:24:36
MAINTENANCE.
SOFTWARE LICENSES, RENEWALS,


[Captioner] 19:24:39
OPERATING SYSTEMS.
SERVICES

[Captioner] 19:24:42
 WHERE THE CITY HAS
PREVIOUSLY PROCURED SOFTWARE AND


[Captioner] 19:24:46
OPERATING SYSTEMS.
AND SO I'D JUST LIKE TO BRING
THAT TO YOUR ATTENTION

[Captioner] 19:24:49
 BECAUSE
YOU CALLED OUT WHEN YOU'RE
PURCHASING

[Captioner] 19:24:53
 HARDWARE, AND
HARDWARE IS LISTED NOWHERE IN
THAT

[Captioner] 19:24:56
 SECTION.
AND HARDWARE IS SOMETHING VERY
DIFFERENT THAN

[Captioner] 19:24:59
 SOFTWARE.
THANK

[Captioner] 19:25:04
 YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
DO WE HAVE ANY OTHER SPEAKERS?

 IS IRIS.
I'M SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE


[Captioner] 19:25:30
RESIDENTS OF METRO CROSSING
COMMUNITY.


[Captioner] 19:25:33
DURING THE LAST TWO MONTHS, WE
HAVE SEEN INCREASING CRIME RISK


[Captioner] 19:25:36
IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD, WHICH HAS
THREATENED THE SAFETY OF

[Captioner] 19:25:40
 OUR
FAMILY AND THE CHILDREN.
WE HAVE SHARED A

[Captioner] 19:25:43
 COPY OF VIDEOS
WITH THE CITY COUNCIL, AND THE


[Captioner] 19:25:46
POLICE DEPARTMENT ON THIS TOPIC.


[Captioner] 19:25:49
INCLUDING PEOPLE STEALING
PACKAGES, FOLLOWING CHILDREN AND
WOMEN IN THE

[Captioner] 19:25:53
 PARKS, JUMPING IN
OUR COMMUNITY

[Captioner] 19:25:56
 JACUZZI WITH FULL
CLOTHES,

[Captioner] 19:25:59
 AND INTRUDERS EVEN
TRYING TO BREAK INTO OUR
BUILDINGS IN

[Captioner] 19:26:02
 THE MIDDLE OF THE
NIGHT.
WE HAVE INSTALLED

[Captioner] 19:26:05
 CAMERAS SO WE
CAN CAPTURE THOSE,

[Captioner] 19:26:08
 BUT WE CANNOT
STOP THEM FROM COMING.
THEY

[Captioner] 19:26:11
 ARE VERY SCARY AND
FRIGHTENING TIMES FOR US.


[Captioner] 19:26:14
WE FEEL WE NEED A GATE AT


[Captioner] 19:26:20
INTERSECTION OF -- AVENUE ON


[Captioner] 19:26:23
BLALOCK TO PROTECT OUR
COMMUNITY.
WE HAVE

[Captioner] 19:26:26

FOR A GATE SIGNED BY

[Captioner] 19:26:30
 OVER 500
RESIDENTS FROM THE METRO
CROSSING COMMUNITY

[Captioner] 19:26:33

DAYS.
WE HAVE SHARED THIS

[Captioner] 19:26:37
 PETITION

WE URGE YOU

[Captioner] 19:26:40
 TO TAKE QUICK ACTION
BEFORE ANY FATALITY

[Captioner] 19:26:43
 HAPPENS.

[Captioner] 19:27:03
I JUST WANT TO THANK THE CITY
COUNCIL FOR

[Captioner] 19:27:06
 RECOGNIZING MUSLIM
APPRECIATION AWARENESS MONTH.
IT IS VERY

[Captioner] 19:27:10
 IMPORTANT THAT
MINORITIES ARE RECOGNIZED

[Captioner] 19:27:13
 AND
ESPECIALLY MARGINALIZED


[Captioner] 19:27:15
MINORITIES ARE RECOGNIZED BY THE
COUNCIL.

[Captioner] 19:27:23
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 19:27:25

THANK YOU FOR ALL

[Captioner] 19:28:07
 THESE
DEDICATIONS OF MUSLIM MONTHS

[Captioner] 19:28:10
 AND
HINDU MONTHS.
I

[Captioner] 19:28:13
 JUST WANT TO BRING TO YOUR
ATTENTION TODAY THAT THE CITY

[Captioner] 19:28:17
 OF
ANTIOCH HAD PASSED TODAY

[Captioner] 19:28:21
 AN
EVENT INCREASE CAP FOR THE CITY
TO, YOU

[Captioner] 19:28:24
 KNOW, STOP THE EVICTIONS
AND THE HOMELESSNESS AND

[Captioner] 19:28:29
 ALL
THIS PROBLEM THAT THESE PEOPLE
ARE

[Captioner] 19:28:32
 FACING UNDER SUCH HARSH
ECONOMIC SITUATION THAT WE'RE
FACING RIGHT NOW,

[Captioner] 19:28:35
 SO I WISH THAT
THE CITY OF OAKLAND CAN ALSO --
CITY OF FREMONT

[Captioner] 19:28:38
 CAN ALSO FOLLOW


[Captioner] 19:28:42
SUIT, AND PROPOSE OR BRING INTO


[Captioner] 19:28:46
EXISTENCE RENT INCREASE CAP
BECAUSE RENTAL IN

[Captioner] 19:28:49
 THE CITY OF
FREMONT HAS

[Captioner] 19:28:54
 BECOME LIKE
UNBEARABLE, PEOPLE CANNOT -- YOU
KNOW,

[Captioner] 19:28:58
 AND WE'VE LOST A LOT OF
OUR SERVICE PEOPLE, A LOT OF


[Captioner] 19:29:01
MINORITIES, A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO
DO NOT HAVE THE HIGH

[Captioner] 19:29:06
 INCOME TO
RENT AT SUCH CRAZY PRICES.
SO TO

[Captioner] 19:29:10
 KEEP THE CITY DIVERSE AND
TO KEEP THE CITY THIS

[Captioner] 19:29:13
 COLORFUL,
WE NEED TO PROVIDE FOR OUR

[Captioner] 19:29:16
 NEEDY
AND POOR AND

[Captioner] 19:29:20
 ALSO LIKE OUR LOW
INCOME FOLKS.
SO THANK YOU SO MUCH AND I HOPE


[Captioner] 19:29:23

THANKS.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:29:26

[Captioner] 19:29:57
 DALWANI.
I'M ECHOING IRIS' THOUGHTS.
I SENT

[Captioner] 19:30:00
 AN EMAIL TO ALL SEVEN


[Captioner] 19:30:03
COUNCILMEMBERS, AND CHIEF OF
POLICE, ABOUT TWO

[Captioner] 19:30:06
 MONDAYS AGO,
AND I'VE SENT VIDEOS

[Captioner] 19:30:10
 AND
PICTURES WHERE THE INTRUDERS,


[Captioner] 19:30:13
BURGLARS ARE TRYING TO BREAK
OPEN OUR DOORS, AND

[Captioner] 19:30:17
 SOMETIMES
THEY HAVE SUCCEEDED.
SO I DON'T WANT TO REPEAT

[Captioner] 19:30:20
 THE
WHOLE THING, BUT PLEASE CHECK
YOUR

[Captioner] 19:30:24
 EMAILS FOR THOSE VIDEOS AND
PICTURES.
THESE ARE

[Captioner] 19:30:27
 VERY SCARY.
WE LIVE IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD
WHERE THE

[Captioner] 19:30:31
 CRIME IS VERY HIGH,
AND WE'RE ASKING FOR A GATE TO


[Captioner] 19:30:34
BE PUT IN BETWEEN

[Captioner] 19:30:38

[Captioner] 19:30:41

THAT ARE NOT

[Captioner] 19:30:54
 AGENDIZED, WE DON'T
COMMENT ON THEM OTHER THAN THANK
YOU FOR THE

[Captioner] 19:30:57
 INFORMATION.
WE'VE SHARED THEM WITH OUR
POLICE DEPARTMENT,

[Captioner] 19:31:01
 AND ALSO
REGARDING IF YOU'RE INTERESTED
IN ANY SORT

[Captioner] 19:31:05
 OF INFRASTRUCTURE
CHANGE, IT USUALLY GOES THROUGH
THE PUBLIC

[Captioner] 19:31:08
 WORKS DEPARTMENT, AND
THAT WOULD REQUIRE A STUDY

[Captioner] 19:31:13
 AND
ALSO DISCUSSIONS WITHIN NOT JUST
ONE NEIGHBORHOOD

[Captioner] 19:31:16
 BUT THE
COMPLETE NEIGHBORHOOD THAT HAS
ACCESS TO THOSE STREETS,

[Captioner] 19:31:19
 SO IT'S
NOT JUST ONE NEIGHBORHOOD, IT
WOULD HAVE TO BE ALL THAT

[Captioner] 19:31:22
 HAVE
ACCESS TO THAT STREET.
NEXT

[Captioner] 19:31:25
 ON OUR AGENDA ITEMS ARE
ITEMS THAT WERE REMOVED FROM

[Captioner] 19:31:29
 THE
CONSENT CALENDAR, AND IF I
REMEMBER CORRECT, IT'S

[Captioner] 19:31:32
 ITEM 2E
AS IN EDWARD AND THAT'S

[Captioner] 19:31:35

CONCERNING THE CIP

[Captioner] 19:31:39
 PLANNER/CIP
CONSULTING SERVICES AND SUPPORT
CONTRACT APPROVALS.


[Captioner] 19:31:42
AND I THINK --
>> Ms. Gauthier: CHRIS.
>> Mayor Mei: 

[Captioner] 19:31:45
CHRIS, PLEASE?


[Captioner] 19:31:49
WELCOME.


[Captioner] 19:31:53
>> CAN YOU HEAR ME?
>> Mayor Mei: YES, SIR.


[Captioner] 19:31:56
>> YES.
SO

[Captioner] 19:31:59
 THERE'S A FEW THINGS I DON'T
SEE IN HERE.


[Captioner] 19:32:02
I DON'T SEE IN THE
RECOMMENDATION DONE BY

[Captioner] 19:32:05
 CITY
STAFF WHERE THEY LOOKED AT AN


[Captioner] 19:32:09
ALTERNATIVE IN THE CLOUD.
IT

[Captioner] 19:32:12
 APPEARS THAT, JUST WITH A
QUICK SEARCH RESULT, THAT THEY
APPEAR

[Captioner] 19:32:16
 TO OFFER HOSTING IN


[Captioner] 19:32:19
MICROSOFT AZURE, SO THAT MIGHT
ACTUALLY ELIMINATE

[Captioner] 19:32:23
 THE SECOND
UPGRADE COST AND ONLY HAVE A


[Captioner] 19:32:27
ONE-TIME UPDATE COST.
IT IS ALSO MAYBE

[Captioner] 19:32:30
 REDUCE THE --
OR INCREASE THE NUMBER OF
VENDORS WHO COULD

[Captioner] 19:32:33
 ACTUALLY HELP
SERVICE IT.


[Captioner] 19:32:37
SO, IN ADDITION TO

[Captioner] 19:32:42
 THAT, IT
CALLS OUT

[Captioner] 19:32:46
 AN EXCEPTION WHERE --
THAT DOESN'T INCLUDE HARDWARE,
AND

[Captioner] 19:32:51
 IT SAYS IN THIS MONEY, THIS
INCLUDES

[Captioner] 19:32:54
 SOFTWARE INSTALLATIONS,
HARDWARE REFRESH, AND
PROFESSIONAL SERVICES.


[Captioner] 19:32:58
AND HARDWARE IS NOT IN ONE OF
THE EXEMPTIONS IN THE CITY

[Captioner] 19:33:02
 CODE,
SO I URGE CITY COUNCIL TO NOT
VOTE TO APPROVE

[Captioner] 19:33:05
 UNTIL EITHER YOU
CHANGE THE CITY COUNCIL

[Captioner] 19:33:09
 MEETING
OR STAFF DOES A BETTER JOB AT
LOOKING AT WHAT TECHNOLOGY IS


[Captioner] 19:33:12
AVAILABLE.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:33:19
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
DO I HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR

[Captioner] 19:33:21

ITEMS -- IS THE STAFF MEMBER FOR
THIS ITEM ALSO AVAILABLE?


[Captioner] 19:33:26
I THINK THAT WOULD BE

[Captioner] 19:33:31
 SANDY?
>> Ms. Briggs: WE CAN ASK IF OUR
I.T. STAFF

[Captioner] 19:33:34
 IS ON THE MEETING,
EITHER OUR -- THERE HE

[Captioner] 19:33:38
 IS.
OUR DIRECTOR SANDY TAYLOR.
>>

[Captioner] 19:33:41
 GOOD EVENING, I'M SANDY
TAYLOR, THE DIRECTOR

[Captioner] 19:33:44
 OF
INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY.
I'M ALSO JOINED THIS EVENING BY


[Captioner] 19:33:47
OUR ENTERPRISE SYSTEMS MANAGER,


[Captioner] 19:33:51
ALICIA HERNANDEZ, SO WE'RE
AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY
QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE


[Captioner] 19:33:54
REGARDING THIS ITEM.


[Captioner] 19:33:58
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT
YOU'RE ON THE

[Captioner] 19:34:00
 LINE, AND IS THERE
ANY QUESTIONS OR ANY MOTIONS
FROM THE COUNCIL?


[Captioner] 19:34:05
OR ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS?
I

[Captioner] 19:34:09
 SEE -- I SEE COUNCILMEMBER
KASSAN.


[Captioner] 19:34:13
>> Councilmember Kassan: SANDY,
DID YOU HEAR A

[Captioner] 19:34:17
 COMMENT THAT K

[Captioner] 19:34:20
 THIS
WAS RELATED TO HARDWARE AND
WE'RE POTENTIALLY

[Captioner] 19:34:24
 NOT ELIGIBLE
FOR THAT EXEMPTION?
WHEN I READ IT I

[Captioner] 19:34:27
 JUST HEAR
SOFTWARE BUT I JUST WONDERED IF
YOU HEARD THE COMMENT AND YOU


[Captioner] 19:34:30
HAD ANY RESPONSE TO IT.
>> COUNCILMEMBER, YES,

[Captioner] 19:34:33
 I DID
HEAR THE COMMENT.
AND ALTHOUGH IT'S

[Captioner] 19:34:37
 REFERENCED IN
THE SUBJECT, THIS IS A

[Captioner] 19:34:41
 SOFTWARE
PURCHASE.
WE HAVE CURRENTLY IN

[Captioner] 19:34:44
 OUR DATA
CENTER VIRTUALIZED ENVIRONMENT


[Captioner] 19:34:48
THAT WILL SUPPORT THE

[Captioner] 19:34:52
 SOFTWARE
INTERNALLY, AND WHEN WE REVIEWED


[Captioner] 19:34:55
THE COST BETWEEN THE DIFFERENCES


[Captioner] 19:34:58
BETWEEN A HOSTED SOLUTION VERSUS
ON

[Captioner] 19:35:02
 PREM, THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT
COST SAVINGS TO CONTINUE TO


[Captioner] 19:35:06
SUPPORT THIS TECHNOLOGY IN
HOUSE.


[Captioner] 19:35:13
>> Councilmember Kassan: THANK
YOU.


[Captioner] 19:35:16
>> Councilmember Jones: I'LL
MOVE TO APPROVE STAFF
RECOMMENDATION.


[Captioner] 19:35:20
>> Mayor Mei: SORRY, JUST ONE
MORE SPEAK E

[Captioner] 19:35:23
 SPEAKER, I WANTED TO SAY.
COUNCILMEMBER COX, DID YOU HAVE
A QUESTION TOO?


[Captioner] 19:35:27
>> Councilmember Cox: YES, AND
REFERRING TO AN EARLIER COMMENT
ABOUT THE

[Captioner] 19:35:31
 SELECTION PROCESS,
MAYBE YOU COULD EXPAND

[Captioner] 19:35:34
 UPON THAT
BASED ON WHAT YOUR FINDINGS
WERE.


[Captioner] 19:35:38
>> OKAY.
ALICIA,

[Captioner] 19:35:41
 DO YOU WANT TO ANSWER
THAT PARTICULAR

[Captioner] 19:35:46
 QUESTION ABOUT
WHY WE CHOSE TO CONTINUE

[Captioner] 19:35:49
 TO USE
CIPA?
I THINK IT WAS CLEARLY

[Captioner] 19:35:53
 OUTLINED
IN THE STAFF REPORT, BUT YOU
KNOW, MAYBE WE CAN GIVE SOME


[Captioner] 19:35:56
MORE DETAIL.


[Captioner] 19:35:59
>> YES.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:36:03
SO THE CITY OF

[Captioner] 19:36:07
 FREMONT, THE
REASON WHY WE DECIDED TO STAY
WITH THE

[Captioner] 19:36:10
 EXISTING SOFTWARE IS
BECAUSE THE

[Captioner] 19:36:13
 CIP PROCESS THAT WE
HAVE

[Captioner] 19:36:16
 IS PRETTY WEAK IN THE

[Captioner] 19:36:19
 SENSE
OF THE FUND ACCOUNTING THAT
NEEDS TO HAPPEN,

[Captioner] 19:36:23
 AND NEIGHBORING
CITIES WERE LOOKING TO CITY OF
FREMONT WANTING

[Captioner] 19:36:26
 TO KNOW WHAT
SOFTWARE CITY OF FREMONT USES


[Captioner] 19:36:30
BECAUSE OTHER CITIES HAVE NOT
BEEN ABLE

[Captioner] 19:36:33
 TO FIND A SOFTWARE
THAT CAN HELP THEM WITH THEIR
TYPE

[Captioner] 19:36:37
 OF FUND ACCOUNTING THAT
THEY NEED TO DO FOR THE CAPITAL


[Captioner] 19:36:40
IMPROVEMENT TYPE OF

[Captioner] 19:36:44
 PROJECTS.
SO FROM OUR -- FROM OUR

[Captioner] 19:36:47
 END
USERS, FROM OUR BUSINESS SIDE,
THEY

[Captioner] 19:36:50
 HAD A STRONG DESIRE TO STAY
ON THE CURRENT

[Captioner] 19:36:53
 SYSTEM.


[Captioner] 19:36:57
>> Councilmember Cox: SO
BASICALLY IT'S A CONTINUATION OF


[Captioner] 19:37:00
THE SOFTWARE SERVICES BASED UPON


[Captioner] 19:37:04
A SOLE JUSTIFICATION ON THIS
ROUND OF AWARDING

[Captioner] 19:37:07
 THE CONTRACT,
OR CONTINUE TO AWARD THE
CONTRACT?


[Captioner] 19:37:10
>> THAT'S CORRECT,
COUNCILMEMBER.


[Captioner] 19:37:14
>> Councilmember Cox: I JUST
WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT WAS
ADDRESSED

[Captioner] 19:37:17
 BASED ON THE -- I
THINK IT WAS WITH THE FIRST

[Captioner] 19:37:20
 OR
SECOND COMMENT THAT WAS STATED
EARLIER

[Captioner] 19:37:23
 IN OUR PUBLIC COMMENTS.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
TO BOTH OF YOU.


[Captioner] 19:37:28
>> THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: NO, THANK YOU TO
THE STAFF.


[Captioner] 19:37:31
I KNOW THAT IN THE WRITE-UP, IT
DOES SAY

[Captioner] 19:37:34
 THAT THIS IS THE
PROPRIETARY VENDOR, WHICH HAS


[Captioner] 19:37:37
BEEN EXISTING SERVICE PROVIDER,
AND SO

[Captioner] 19:37:40
 THAT'S WHY THE SOLE
SOURCE JUSTIFICATION WAS
APPROVED.


[Captioner] 19:37:44
AND I APPRECIATE THAT YOU DID
WORK WITH OUR

[Captioner] 19:37:47
 END USERS AS
THEY'RE THE ONES WHO ARE SEEING
THE

[Captioner] 19:37:51
 IMPACT AND THE ABILITY TO
CONTINUE.
SO WITH THAT, I KNOW THERE WAS A


[Captioner] 19:37:54
MOTION.
>> Ms. Gauthier: THERE'S STILL A
HAND RAISED HERE FOR KELLY.


[Captioner] 19:37:57
I DON'T KNOW IF KELLY INTENDED
TO RAISE HIS HAND FOR

[Captioner] 19:38:00
 THIS
PARTICULAR ITEM?
>> Mayor Mei: I THINK IT'S THE


[Captioner] 19:38:03
NEXT ITEM, BUT SURE, YOU WANT TO
CHECK WITH KELLY IS THIS
REGARDING

[Captioner] 19:38:06
 THIS ITEM?
BECAUSE NORMALLY AFTER WE ASK
FOR THE SPEAKER ON THIS

[Captioner] 19:38:08
 ITEM.
>> Ms. Gauthier: SORRY, THE HAND
IS DOWN NOW.


[Captioner] 19:38:12
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
I THINK IT'S FOR THE NEXT ITEM.
I HAVE A MOTION

[Captioner] 19:38:15
 BY COUNCILMEMBER
JONES AND A SECOND BY


[Captioner] 19:38:18
COUNCILMEMBER KENG.
SO CAN I PLEASE

[Captioner] 19:38:21
 HAVE A VOTE?


[Captioner] 19:38:25
AND AGAIN, THIS IS FOR

[Captioner] 19:38:29
 ITEM --
>> Ms. Gauthier: 2E.
>> Mayor Mei:  -- 2E.


[Captioner] 19:38:32
AND THE MOTION PASSES
UNANIMOUSLY.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:38:36
FOR 2E.
NEXT

[Captioner] 19:38:42
 IS ITEM 2F AS IN FRANK,
WHICH IS THE HAZARD

[Captioner] 19:38:45
 MITIGATION
GRANT FUNDS, AND I BELIEVE THAT
IS THE ONE THAT KELLY HAD

[Captioner] 19:38:48
 RAISED
HIS LAND.
>> Ms. Gauthier: YES.


[Captioner] 19:38:51
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
WELCOME, KELLY.
>> THANK

[Captioner] 19:38:58
 YOU.
AS WE UPDATE THE

[Captioner] 19:39:02
 HAZARDS,
THERE'S A NUMBER OF KNOWN
HAZARDS THAT THE CITY HASN'T


[Captioner] 19:39:05
DONE A VERY GOOD

[Captioner] 19:39:09
 JOB OF
ACKNOWLEDGING AND INTEGRATING
THE KNOWN KNOWLEDGE OUT

[Captioner] 19:39:12
 THERE.
FOR EXAMPLE, THE

[Captioner] 19:39:17
 EARTHQUAKE
FAULT -- EARTHQUAKE FAULTS.


[Captioner] 19:39:21
THERE'S SOME -- THE HAYWARD
FAULT IS PROBABLY

[Captioner] 19:39:24
 PRETTY WELL
MAPPED, BUT THE MISSION FAULT
DOESN'T SHOW UP ON

[Captioner] 19:39:27
 CITY MAPS
HARDLY AT ALL.


[Captioner] 19:39:33
WHEN PROJECTS ARE PROPOSED UP
THERE NEAR STANFORD

[Captioner] 19:39:38
 AVENUE AND
MISSION PEAK, WE GET A PARADE OF
GEOTECHNICAL

[Captioner] 19:39:41
 EXPERTS THAT HAPPEN
TO LIVE IN SUBURBS

[Captioner] 19:39:44
 RIGHT THERE.
THEY SWEAR UP AND DOWN

[Captioner] 19:39:47
 THAT


[Captioner] 19:39:50
THERE ARE GEOTECHNICAL HAZARDS
UP THERE, ALL KINDS

[Captioner] 19:39:54
 OF EARTH
MOVEMENT AND THINGS, PROBABLY
RELATED TO THOSE FAULTS,

[Captioner] 19:39:57
 BUT
WHATEVER.
AND

[Captioner] 19:40:01
 SO THE LANDSLIDE MAPS AND
THE EXISTING

[Captioner] 19:40:04
 LANDSLIDES,
HISTORICAL LANDSLIDES, ANCIENT


[Captioner] 19:40:10
LANDSLIDE, THERE'S LANDSLIDE
UPON LANDSLIDE OVER THERE, AND
THEY

[Captioner] 19:40:13
 KNOW ALL ABOUT THEM.
AND THE CITY NEEDS TO KNOW

[Captioner] 19:40:15
 ABOUT
THEM BEFORE PUTTING IN
SUBDIVISIONS.


[Captioner] 19:40:19
OR PUTTING IN ANY MORE
SUBDIVISIONS UP

[Captioner] 19:40:22
 THERE.
AND THEN THE TSUNAMI MAPS.
THE STATE

[Captioner] 19:40:25
 OF CALIFORNIA LIKE A
WEEK AGO JUST PUT OUT A NEW


[Captioner] 19:40:28
TSUNAMI MAP, AND THAT GOES ALL
ALONG

[Captioner] 19:40:31
 THE BAYSHORE UP TO CERTAIN
POINT.


[Captioner] 19:40:36
THE CITY IS NOT AS BAD, IT'S NOT
LIKE THE CITY OF ALAMEDA THAT
HAS LIKE

[Captioner] 19:40:39
 HALF THE CITY IS
UNDERNEATH THE TSUNAMI

[Captioner] 19:40:42
 WARNING,
BUT YOU KNOW, THE CITY SHOULD
TAKE THAT INTO

[Captioner] 19:40:46
 ACCOUNT BEFORE
PUTTING ANY MORE INDUSTRIAL
BUILDINGS

[Captioner] 19:40:50
 OVER THERE LOW DOWN IN
THE BAYSIDE DISTRICT.


[Captioner] 19:40:53
SO YEAH, THE EXISTING

[Captioner] 19:40:56
 SITUATION
WHEN IT COMES TO HAZARD
MITIGATION AND FAULT

[Captioner] 19:41:01
 MAPS AND
HAZ-MAPS AND EVEN THE WILDFIRE


[Captioner] 19:41:05
RISKS, I'M SURE, HAVE NOT BEEN
THOROUGHLY ANALYZED.


[Captioner] 19:41:08
THESE THINGS NEED TO BE DONE
MORE CAREFULLY AND MORE

[Captioner] 19:41:11

RIGOROUSLY, AND WITH REAL FAULT
MAPS AND

[Captioner] 19:41:15
 REAL LANDSLIDE MAPS.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:41:21
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
I THINK THAT JUST IN

[Captioner] 19:41:24
 READING
THIS, THOUGH, I JUST WANTED TO
CLARIFY, I THINK IT'S FOR

[Captioner] 19:41:26
 THE
GRANT FUNDING TO REQUEST THE
UPDATES.


[Captioner] 19:41:29
AND I APPRECIATE YOU MENTIONING
SOME OTHER HAZARDS THAT MAY OR
MAY

[Captioner] 19:41:32
 NOT BE MENTIONED, BUT I
THINK IT'S UNDER THE COMMON


[Captioner] 19:41:36
PROFILE AND HOPEFULLY AS WE WORK
WITH FEMA

[Captioner] 19:41:39
 AND WITH CAL OES TO
SECURE THIS

[Captioner] 19:41:43
 CONTRACT, THAT THEY
WILL BE UPDATING IT AND


[Captioner] 19:41:46
INCLUSIVE OF THE NEWER MAPS THAT
ARE BEING CURRENTLY RELEASED, I


[Captioner] 19:41:49
BELIEVE THIS IS OVER THE

[Captioner] 19:41:52
 NEXT
PERIOD OF TIME, WHICH WILL BE
ALLOWING US THE FUNDING TO


[Captioner] 19:41:56
PROCURE THAT SERVICE.
ARE THERE ANY

[Captioner] 19:41:59
 QUESTIONS FROM THE
COUNCIL?
I'M TRYING TO SEE WHO'S

[Captioner] 19:42:02
 THE
STAFF MEMBER.


[Captioner] 19:42:05
>> Ms. Gauthier: 

[Captioner] 19:42:10
ALEC TUNE IS
HERE.
>> Mayor Mei: I SEE


[Captioner] 19:42:13
COUNCILMEMBER SHAO.
>> Councilmember Shao: THANK


[Captioner] 19:42:17
YOU, MADAME MAYOR.
I'M READY TO MOVE TO APPROVE THE
ITEM.


[Captioner] 19:42:20
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER SHAO, AND


[Captioner] 19:42:23
THEN I SEE A SPEAKER BUTTON

[Captioner] 19:42:26
 FROM
COUNCILMEMBER COX.
DID YOU HAVE --


[Captioner] 19:42:28
>> Councilmember Cox: I WAS
GOING TO SAY SECOND.
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY, THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:42:32
SO WE HAVE IT MOVED AND SECOND.
AND IF YOU CAN

[Captioner] 19:42:35
 PUSH YOUR BUTTON
ON THE DAIS.


[Captioner] 19:42:40
THIS IS AGAIN ITEM 2F AS IN
FRANK TO UPDATE

[Captioner] 19:42:43
 THE LOCAL HAZARD
MITIGATION PLAN.
AND ACCEPT

[Captioner] 19:42:46
 THE FUNDS FROM FEMA
ONLY.


[Captioner] 19:42:51
>> Ms. Gauthier: CAN EVERYONE
VOTE, PLEASE?
>> Mayor Mei: HAS EVERYONE


[Captioner] 19:42:54
VOTED, PLEASE, ON THE DAIS?


[Captioner] 19:43:03
>> Ms. Gauthier: KASSAN IS THE
LAST ONE.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:43:05
SO THE MOTION CARRIES
UNANIMOUSLY.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:43:12
NEXT ON OUR REGULARLY SCHEDULED
ITEMS THIS EVENING IS

[Captioner] 19:43:16
 ITEM 5A,
WHICH IS THE BOND ISSUANCE FOR


[Captioner] 19:43:19
PACIFIC WEST COMMUNITIES.
AND THIS IS A

[Captioner] 19:43:23
 PUBLIC HEARING TO
CONSIDER THE ISSUANCE OF


[Captioner] 19:43:26
TAX-EXEMPT BONDS FOR THE PURPOSE
OF REFINANCING A MULTIFAMILY
AFFORDABLE

[Captioner] 19:43:29
 HOUSING PROJECT KNOWN
AS OSGOOD

[Captioner] 19:43:34
 APARTMENTS SOUTH
AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECT,
LOCATED IN THE CITY

[Captioner] 19:43:37
 OF FREMONT,
AND THE PUBLIC HEARING IS
REGARDING THE FINANCING WHICH


[Captioner] 19:43:40
 WHICH IS
REQUIRED BY FEDERAL TAX LAW.


[Captioner] 19:43:43
AND THERE'S NO PRESENTATION THIS
EVENING, BUT WE HAVE

[Captioner] 19:43:49
 LEE MC
COREMICQ FROM

[Captioner] 19:43:51
 THE CALIFORNIA
MUNICIPAL AUTHORITY AS WELL AS
FINANCE DIRECTOR DAVE PERSSELIN


[Captioner] 19:43:55
AND HOUSING MANAGER

[Captioner] 19:43:59
 LUCIA HUGHES
ARE AVAILABLE FOR ANY QUESTIONS.
AND AT THIS TIME, ARE THERE

[Captioner] 19:44:02
 ANY
QUESTIONS FROM THE
COUNCILMEMBERS ON

[Captioner] 19:44:05
 THIS

[Captioner] 19:44:11
 ITEM?
SEEING NONE, I'M GOING TO OPEN
THE

[Captioner] 19:44:14
 PUBLIC HEARING AND WE WILL
NOW HEAR FROM ANY PERSONS WHO


[Captioner] 19:44:17
WISH TO SPEAK ABOUT THE PROPOSED

 OR IF YOU'RE
CALLING IN, PLEASE PRESS
STAR NINE IF YOU'D LIKE

[Captioner] 19:44:29
 TO
ADDRESS THIS ITEM.
>> Ms. Gauthier: WE CURRENTLY


[Captioner] 19:44:33
HAVE ONE, KEITH PARKER.


[Captioner] 19:44:35
SORRY, TWO.
KEITH PARKER IS THE FIRST.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:44:39
WELCOME, KEITH.


[Captioner] 19:44:42
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.


[Captioner] 19:44:45
SO TONIGHT I WANT TO GO AHEAD
AND DISCUSS THE PROPOSED BOND
FOR AFFORDABLE

[Captioner] 19:44:47
 HOUSING ON OSGOOD
ROAD.
I WANT TO START OFF BY SAYING


[Captioner] 19:44:50
THAT I THINK THIS IS EXACTLY THE
KIND OF DEVELOPMENT THAT WE NEED
TO SEE HERE IN

[Captioner] 19:44:54
 FREMONT.
IT OFFERS A MEANINGFUL NUMBER OF


[Captioner] 19:44:57
AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS AT A
PREDETERMINED COST

[Captioner] 19:45:00
 STRUCTURES,
MEANING WE'VE DEFINED WHAT
CONSTITUTES AFFORDABLE,

[Captioner] 19:45:04
 TO 100
FAMILIES IN OUR CITY.
IT'S WITHOUT FISCAL

[Captioner] 19:45:07
 IMPACT OTHER
THAN THE $6 MILLION LOAN WHICH
WAS ALREADY APPROVED.


[Captioner] 19:45:10
NOW PLEASE DON'T THINK I'M
OPPOSING THIS IN ANY

[Captioner] 19:45:13
 WAY, THIS
IS POTENTIALLY THE EXACT KIND OF
PROGRAM WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT.


[Captioner] 19:45:16
WHAT I WANT TO BE SURE OF IS
THAT WE'RE APPROACHING THIS
PROJECT IN A

[Captioner] 19:45:19
 THOUGHTFUL MANNER.
BY THAT I MEAN AS WE MAKE THESE


[Captioner] 19:45:23
UNITS AVAILABLE TO THOSE IN
NEED, IS THERE A PREESTABLISHED
PROCESS BY WHICH

[Captioner] 19:45:26
 WE CAN IDENTIFY
THOSE TO WHOM WE WANT TO MAKE
THESE

[Captioner] 19:45:29
 UNITS AVAILABLE TO, TO
TRACK THOSE PEOPLE ARE BEING


[Captioner] 19:45:33
SUCCESSFULLY HOUSED LONG TERM
AND MADE AVAILABLE TO THOSE WHO
CAN

[Captioner] 19:45:36
 BEST BENEFIT FROM THEM?
IN OTHER WORDS, HOW EXACTLY IS
THE PROGRAM BEING

[Captioner] 19:45:39
 MANAGED?
LET ME EXPLAIN WHY I THINK THIS
IS SO

[Captioner] 19:45:43
 IMPORTANT.
I THINK IT'S VITAL WE LOOK AT
HOW OTHER

[Captioner] 19:45:46
 CITIES ARE ATTACKING
THE HOMELESS CHALLENGE AND LEARN
FROM THEM AND

[Captioner] 19:45:48
 IDENTIFY WHAT'S
WORKING WELL AND WHAT COULD BE
DONE BETTER.


[Captioner] 19:45:52
IN SHORT I WANT TO BE SURE WE'RE
LEARNING FROM THE MISTAKES AND


[Captioner] 19:45:55
SUCCESSES OF OTHERS, THAT WE'RE
APPLYING OUR LIMITED RESOURCES
IN

[Captioner] 19:45:58
 A THOUGHTFUL MANNER, ONE THAT
ASSURES WE'RE PROVIDING THE
GREATEST

[Captioner] 19:46:00
 BENEFIT POSSIBLE TO THE
MOST PEOPLE POSSIBLE FOR EVERY
DOLLAR SPENT.


[Captioner] 19:46:04
AND WITH THAT IN MIND, I WANT TO
POINT OUT THAT THE CITY OF
OAKLAND

[Captioner] 19:46:07
 RECENTLY PUBLISHED AN
AUDIT OF THEIR HOMELESS
SERVICES, AND

[Captioner] 19:46:10
 ACCORDING TO THEIR
OWN INTERNAL AUDIT, THERE IS A
LOT OF ROOM

[Captioner] 19:46:13
 FOR IMPROVEMENT.
NOW IN THE TIME TONIGHT I CAN'T
GO INTO SPECIFIC

[Captioner] 19:46:16
 DETAIL, BUT IT
ESSENTIALLY SAYS THE CITY OF


[Captioner] 19:46:20
OAKLAND SPENT $69 MILLION FOR
HOMELESS SERVICES FOR WHICH IT
HAS

[Captioner] 19:46:23
 RECEIVED, AND I QUOTE, MIXED
RESULTS.
THERE'S SIX

[Captioner] 19:46:26
 SECTIONS IN THE
AUDIT AND I WANT TO QUOTE THREE
EXAMPLES.


[Captioner] 19:46:30
SECTION ONE

[Captioner] 19:46:33
 STATES THE CITY HAD
MIXED RESULTS IN HELPING
PARTICIPANTS EXIT

[Captioner] 19:46:36
 TO PERMANENT
HOUSING, MANY LONG TERM OUTCOMES
WERE

[Captioner] 19:46:40
 UNKNOWN, AND LENGTH OF STAY
NEED MORE ANALYSIS.


[Captioner] 19:46:44
SECTION THREE STATE, AND I
QUOTE, THE CITY LACKS ACCESS TO


[Captioner] 19:46:47
ACCURATE, TIMELY AND COMPLETE
DATA TO FULLY UNDERSTAND SERVICE


[Captioner] 19:46:51
PROVIDER PERFORMANCE,

[Captioner] 19:46:56
 -- RETURN
TO HOMELESSNESS.


[Captioner] 19:46:59
FINALLY THE CITY NEEDS TO MOVE
HOMELESSNESS SERVICES FORWARD BY


[Captioner] 19:47:03
ADOPTING AN ADOPTABLE STRATEGIC
PLAN.
IN SHORT

[Captioner] 19:47:06
 THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT
IN AND OF ITSELF LOOKS GREAT ON
PAPER.


[Captioner] 19:47:10
PROVIDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS
ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS
WE CAN DO TO MITIGATE

[Captioner] 19:47:13

HOMELESSNESS.
I'M COMPLETELY IN FAVOR OF IT


[Captioner] 19:47:16
BUT ONLY PART OF A LONGER, LARGE
TERM

[Captioner] 19:47:19
 COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAM
THOUGHTFULLY CONSTRUCTED TO HELP
SOLVE

[Captioner] 19:47:23
 HOMELESSNESS IN FREMONT.
LET'S LEARN FROM OAKLAND'S


[Captioner] 19:47:25
MISTAKES.
DO FORWARD AND DO EVEN BETTER.
LET'S LEAD THE WAY WITH


[Captioner] 19:47:29
THOUGHTFUL, INTELLIGENT PROGRAMS
THAT PROVIDE REAL BENEFITS TO
THE PEOPLE WHO NEED IT THE MOST.


[Captioner] 19:47:33
IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO FOR
OUR UNHOUSED POPULATION, OUR


[Captioner] 19:47:36
TAXPAYERS AND OUR COMMUNITY.
THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK

[Captioner] 19:47:39
 YOU.
>> Ms. Gauthier: NEXT SPEAKER IS
CHRIS.


[Captioner] 19:47:42
>> Mayor Mei: WELCOME, CHRIS.


[Captioner] 19:47:46
>> SO I'M ALL FOR DOING
HOMELESSNESS

[Captioner] 19:47:50
 IN FREMONT.
BUT WHEN I LOOK AT THE PRICETAG
FOR

[Captioner] 19:47:54
 THIS, I THOUGHT THERE MUST
HAVE BEEN SOMETHING WRONG.


[Captioner] 19:47:58
AND SOMEONE PLEASE CORRECT ME IF
I'M WRONG, BUT IF

[Captioner] 19:48:01
 WE WERE
BUILDING STANDALONE HOMES

[Captioner] 19:48:05
 HERE,
WE'D BE SPENDING OVER HALF A


[Captioner] 19:48:07
MILLION DOLLARS ON EACH
STANDALONE HOME WE WERE
BUILDING.


[Captioner] 19:48:11
BUT WE'RE BUILDING APARTMENTS.
AND WE'RE GOING

[Captioner] 19:48:15
 TO SPEND
$650,000

[Captioner] 19:48:18
 PER UNIT BASICALLY TO
PUT APARTMENTS IN.
SOMEONE

[Captioner] 19:48:22
 HAS GOT TO BE MAKING
MONEY THERE, AND IT'S NOT GOING
TO THE BENEFIT OF

[Captioner] 19:48:25
 THE HOMELESS.
THERE'S

[Captioner] 19:48:28
 GOT TO BE SOME SET OF --
BETTER

[Captioner] 19:48:31
 PLAN, MAYBE WITH FINDING
SOMEONE TO

[Captioner] 19:48:35
 REDUE THE FRY CENTER
INTO

[Captioner] 19:48:38
 MULTIPLE LARGE UNITS FOR
HOMELESS OR LOW INCOME PEOPLE.
I DO

[Captioner] 19:48:41
 REALIZE THAT THIS WAS GOING
TO

[Captioner] 19:48:44
 PEOPLE 55 AND OLDER.
AND

[Captioner] 19:48:47
 SO -- BUT IT'S STILL A LOT
OF MONEY BEING SPENT FOR

[Captioner] 19:48:51
 THE
IMPACT IT'S GOING TO HAVE.
THANK

[Captioner] 19:48:55
 YOU.
>> Ms. Gauthier: THANK YOU.
WE HAVE AN ADDITIONAL

[Captioner] 19:48:58
 SPEAKER.
MERVIN.


[Captioner] 19:49:02
>> Mayor Mei: WELCOME, MERVIN.


[Captioner] 19:49:15
MERVIN?
>> YES.
GOOD EVENING, EVERYBODY.


[Captioner] 19:49:19
AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
I JUST WANTED

[Captioner] 19:49:22
 TO PUT

[Captioner] 19:49:26
 ACROSS THE
HOME SITUATION IN FREMONT.
I HAVE BEEN DOING A

[Captioner] 19:49:30
 LOT OF --
THERE IS NOTHING DONE

[Captioner] 19:49:34
 FOR THE
SENIORS.
THEY TALK OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING,


[Captioner] 19:49:37
THEY ARE TALKING HOMELESSNESS
AND EVERYTHING.
WHAT

[Captioner] 19:49:42
 IS THE FACILITY AVAILABLE
FOR SENIORS?
I

[Captioner] 19:49:44
 HAVE NEVER SEEN THE WORD
"SENIOR" USED IN ANY OF THESE.


[Captioner] 19:49:50
WHEN YOU SAY A SENIOR HOUSING IS
COMING UP, YOU

[Captioner] 19:49:54
 SEE THE MONEY
INVOLVED OVER THERE.


[Captioner] 19:49:59
$1,400 A -- IS GOING TO PAY, AND
THEY SAY YOU SHOULD BE EARNING


[Captioner] 19:50:02
TWICE THE RENT.
I DON'T KNOW WHO MAKES THESE
ISSUES.


[Captioner] 19:50:06
IT'S REALLY STRANGE THAT, YOU
KNOW, YOU ARE MAKING

[Captioner] 19:50:09
 AN
AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR A THE


[Captioner] 19:50:13
SENIORS, HE SHOULD PAY AND THEN
DOUBLE THE

[Captioner] 19:50:16
 RENT, HE SHOULD BE
EARNING PAY STUB.


[Captioner] 19:50:23
I DON'T -- I HAVE NEVER SEEN THE
WORD "SENIOR

[Captioner] 19:50:26
 HOUSING."
THEY TALK HOMELESSNESS, THEY
TALK OF

[Captioner] 19:50:29
 AFFORDABLE HOUSING,
THEY'RE TALKING OF SUBSIDIZED


[Captioner] 19:50:33
HOUSING, SO MANY HOUSING THEY'RE
TALKING.
EVEN

[Captioner] 19:50:36
 TALKING

[Captioner] 19:50:40
 TO DR. HUANG,
EVERYONE AT

[Captioner] 19:50:43
 HOME, HABITAT FOR
HUMANITY.
I'VE DONE A LOT OF RESEARCH ON


[Captioner] 19:50:47
THIS HOME FRONT.
I SHOULD BECOME A

[Captioner] 19:50:50
 CONSULTANT,
WHICH I AM NOT.


[Captioner] 19:50:55
ANYWAY, WHAT IS AVAILABLE OR
AVAILABLE FOR THEM

[Captioner] 19:50:57
 IN THEIR
GOLDEN YEARS?
I WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE IF THE


[Captioner] 19:51:01
CITY LOOKS INTO

[Captioner] 19:51:06
 THAT RIGHT AWAY.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
>> Ms. Gauthier: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:51:09
THE NEXT SPEAKER IS KATHERINE.


[Captioner] 19:51:15
>> HI.
CAN YOU HEAR ME?
>> Mayor Mei: YES.


[Captioner] 19:51:18
>> OKAY.
I WANTED TO LET YOU

[Captioner] 19:51:21
 KNOW FIRST
BEFORE I GET STARTED IS, I TRIED
TO SIGN IN

[Captioner] 19:51:25
 TO THE LIVESTREAM
FROM YOUR WEBSITE, AND I COULD


[Captioner] 19:51:28
NOT HEAR YOU, I HAD ALL MY
VOLUME LEVELS TURNED

[Captioner] 19:51:31
 ALL THE WAY
UP, SO YOU MIGHT WANT TO HAVE A
TECH PERSON CHECK INTO

[Captioner] 19:51:37
 THAT.
OKAY.


[Captioner] 19:51:41
SO OF COURSE I AM IN FAVOR

[Captioner] 19:51:44
 OF
ANY HOUSING THAT IS GOING TO BE


[Captioner] 19:51:48
SUPPORTIVE OF OUR HOMELESS
POPULATION.
IT IS

[Captioner] 19:51:51
 GETTING INSANELY OUT OF
CONTROL WITH COST OF

[Captioner] 19:51:54
 LIVING, NOT
KEEPING

[Captioner] 19:52:00
 UP WITH

[Captioner] 19:52:03
 INFLATION,
HIGHER RENT PRICES, HIGHER
OWNING PRICES AND

[Captioner] 19:52:06
 WE ARE FAR,
FAR, FAR BEHIND IN BUILDING
HOUSING

[Captioner] 19:52:11
 FOR MIDDLE INCOME ALL
THE WAY

[Captioner] 19:52:15
 DOWN.
WHEN A MIDDLE INCOME PERSON
CAN'T FIND A

[Captioner] 19:52:19
 HOME THAT THEY CAN
GET INTO, THEY'RE GOING TO LOOK
FOR LOWER INCOME

[Captioner] 19:52:22
 HOUSING WHICH
IS GOING TO DISPLACE LOWER
INCOME PEOPLE AND IT JUST KEEPS


[Captioner] 19:52:25
GOING ON DOWN.
AND WE'VE GOT, OF

[Captioner] 19:52:29
 COURSE, COVID
WHICH HAS INTERFERED WITH PEOPLE
BEING ABLE TO HOLD ON TO JOBS


[Captioner] 19:52:33
AND HOMES, AND IT'S EXACERBATING
THE

[Captioner] 19:52:38
 ISSUE.


[Captioner] 19:52:41
SO I FEEL LIKE WE HAVE STARTED
OFF

[Captioner] 19:52:45
 STRONG BY BUILDING THE

[Captioner] 19:52:48
 HNC
CENTER.
I FEEL LIKE WE STARTED

[Captioner] 19:52:52
 OFF ON
THE RIGHT FOOT

[Captioner] 19:52:55
 WITH THE SAFE
PARKING PLAN, AND WE WERE HOPING


[Captioner] 19:52:58
TO GET STATE FUNDING FOR THE


[Captioner] 19:53:01
HOMEKEY PROJECT, WHICH DID NOT
COME THROUGH,

[Captioner] 19:53:04
 AND I FEEL LIKE
THE SAFE PARKING PROGRAM HAS
FROZEN

[Captioner] 19:53:07
 IN PLACE,

[Captioner] 19:53:11
 AND SO I'M
FEELING

[Captioner] 19:53:14
 LIKE THESE ARE ALL
STAGES TOWARDS THE END

[Captioner] 19:53:17
 RESULT OF
BEING HOUSED IN A LONG-TERM
BASIS.


[Captioner] 19:53:26
AND MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IS
THE ULTIMATE GOAL, EVEN WITH THE
SAFE

[Captioner] 19:53:29
 PARKING.
SO I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO SEE
THAT PROGRAM

[Captioner] 19:53:32
 GET EXTENDED INTO
THE NEXT STAGES

[Captioner] 19:53:36
 SO THAT WE CAN
KEEP THIS GOING, AND HAVE PEOPLE
READY

[Captioner] 19:53:39
 TO MOVE INTO HOUSING, WHEN
IT IS

[Captioner] 19:53:42
 BUILT.


[Captioner] 19:53:47
SO OBVIOUSLY THIS NEEDS TO BE
LONG TERM AS WELL.


[Captioner] 19:53:52
SO I JUST NEED TO SEE MORE

[Captioner] 19:53:55
 HOMES
BUILT.
AND MY LAST CONCERN IS PEOPLE


[Captioner] 19:53:59
BEING REMOVED FROM

[Captioner] 19:54:05
 APPLICATIONS
AND A WAIT LIST IF THEY HAVE AN
ADDRESS, AND I THINK

[Captioner] 19:54:09
 THAT
THAT'S -- I UNDERSTAND THE
REASONING BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S


[Captioner] 19:54:12
FAIR TO PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO
GET OUT OF AN

[Captioner] 19:54:15
 UNHEALTHY HOUSING
SITUATION.
SO THESE ARE THINGS TO CONSIDER.


[Captioner] 19:54:25
>> Ms. Gauthier: WE HAVE AN
ADDITIONAL SPEAKER, BLAIR
BEEKMAN.


[Captioner] 19:54:29
>> Mayor Mei: JUST TO CLARIFY
FOR ALL, THIS IS REGARDING THE
BOND

[Captioner] 19:54:30
 ISSUANCE.
THANK YOU.
>> HI.


[Captioner] 19:54:34
THANK YOU.
BLAIR BEEKMAN HERE.


[Captioner] 19:54:37
IT'S BEEN A WHILE SINCE I'VE
BEEN AT A FREMONT PUBLIC
MEETING.


[Captioner] 19:54:40
HELLO.
I

[Captioner] 19:54:43
 JUST WANTED TO OFFER

[Captioner] 19:54:47
 A THANK
YOU FOR THIS ITEM, AND

[Captioner] 19:54:50
 YOUR
FIRST PUBLIC COMMENTER, I WAS
INTERESTED IN HIS WORDS.


[Captioner] 19:54:53
HE OFFERED A REALLY ORGANIZED,
GOOD

[Captioner] 19:54:56
 APPROACH OF HOW TO ADDRESS
THIS SORT OF ISSUE AND

[Captioner] 19:55:00
 USED
EXAMPLES OF REFERRING TO OTHER


[Captioner] 19:55:03
CITIES AND LEARNING

[Captioner] 19:55:07
 HOW TO LEARN
FROM THEIR MISTAKES, LEARN THEIR
GOOD

[Captioner] 19:55:10
 POINTS, AND THAT WAS
IMPORTANT TO MYSELF.
AND

[Captioner] 19:55:13
 THE PREVIOUS PUBLIC
COMMENTER SPOKE ON THE CONCEPTS
OF

[Captioner] 19:55:16
 WHAT ARE WE DOING OVERALL IN
FREMONT FOR THE FUTURE OF

[Captioner] 19:55:20
 REAL
AFFORDABLE HOUSING FOR EXTREMELY
LOW AND VERY LOW INCOME

[Captioner] 19:55:23
 PEOPLE.
AND SO I

[Captioner] 19:55:26
 WAS CURIOUS, I WAS
INTERESTED IN PUBLIC COMMENT

[Captioner] 19:55:30
 AT
THIS

[Captioner] 19:55:33
 TIME TO QUICKLY OFFER.
THANK YOU FOR THE WORDS OF

[Captioner] 19:55:35

MERVIN AND THE CONCEPTS OF
SENIOR HOUSING.


[Captioner] 19:55:39
THAT WAS NICE TO HEAR FOR THE
FUTURE OF FREMONT ALSO.


[Captioner] 19:55:43
WHAT'S OF INTEREST TO MYSELF
WITH THIS SORT OF

[Captioner] 19:55:47
 PROJECT IS AS
ALWAYS, I'M LEARNING MORE AND
MORE HOW WE CAN

[Captioner] 19:55:50
 ADDRESS THE
FUTURE OF VERY LOW

[Captioner] 19:55:53
 AND EXTREMELY
LOW INCOME HOUSING IN

[Captioner] 19:55:56
 TERMS OF
MIXED INCOME IDEAS, AND HOW
MIXED

[Captioner] 19:56:00
 INCOME CAN OFFER THE
FLEXIBILITY AND CHOICES IN

[Captioner] 19:56:03
 OUR
FUTURE TO HOUSE, YOU

[Captioner] 19:56:07
 KNOW, VERY
LOW AND EXTREMELY LOW WITH
MODERATE AND

[Captioner] 19:56:10
 REGULAR INCOME
PEOPLE.
OR MODERATE AND LOW

[Captioner] 19:56:14
 INCOME
PEOPLE.
THAT'S A CONCEPT THAT

[Captioner] 19:56:17
 I THINK WE
ALL UNDERSTAND, BUT WE

[Captioner] 19:56:20
 JUST --
WE DON'T KNOW HOW TO PRACTICE IT
BETTER AND TALK ABOUT IT

[Captioner] 19:56:23
 BETTER
OPENLY.
AND I THINK IN THE NEXT FEW


[Captioner] 19:56:27
YEARS, AND THE NEXT DECADE,
THERE CAN BE A

[Captioner] 19:56:30
 TIME TO DO THAT.
I DON'T KNOW IF THIS SORT OF
PROJECT, WHAT

[Captioner] 19:56:34
 YOU'RE WORKING ON
TODAY, CAN OFFER THOSE CHOICES
BUT I

[Captioner] 19:56:37
 THINK IT OFFERS AN AMAZING
FLEXIBILITY IN HOW TO TALK

[Captioner] 19:56:40
 ABOUT
AFFORDABLE HOUSING ISSUES FOR
OUR FUTURE, THAT I JUST WANTED


[Captioner] 19:56:45
TO REMIND YOURSELVES OF AND ALSO
TO

[Captioner] 19:56:48
 REMIND THE COUNTY OF SANTA
CLARA IS WORKING

[Captioner] 19:56:51
 ON A PROGRAM TO
HOUSE THE

[Captioner] 19:56:55
 MAJORITY OF HOMELESS
FAMILIES

[Captioner] 19:56:58
 BY 2025.
IT'S AN AMBITIOUS

[Captioner] 19:57:02
 GOAL, BUT WITH
THE INTENTION OF NOT JUST USING


[Captioner] 19:57:06
HOMEKEY FUND BUG PUCING WHAT CAN
BE AVAILABLE IN THE

[Captioner] 19:57:09
 NEXT DECADE
OF STATE FUNDING TO REALLY HOUSE


[Captioner] 19:57:12
AND SUBSIDIZE HOMELESS FAMILIES
WHO PREVIOUSLY, YOU

[Captioner] 19:57:15
 KNOW, COULD
ONLY GET HOUSING FOR, YOU KNOW,
SIX MONTHS

[Captioner] 19:57:19
 TO 18 MONTHS.
WE CAN NOW SUBSIDIZE THEM FOR
TWO TO FIVE

[Captioner] 19:57:22
 YEARS, AND THAT
COULD REALLY GET THEM A GOOD
HANDLE ON

[Captioner] 19:57:25
 THINGS.
AND I HOPE THAM 

[Captioner] 19:57:28
 THAT CAN BE
APPLICABLE FOR THIS ITEM AND
REALLY CONSIDER

[Captioner] 19:57:31
 THE FUTURE OF
HOW TO HOUSE OUR PEOPLE, AS WAS
SPOKEN

[Captioner] 19:57:35
 ABOUT.
>> Ms. Gauthier: THE NEXT
SPEAKER IS

[Captioner] 19:57:38
 LISA DANZ.
>> Mayor Mei: WELCOME, LISA.
>> HI, THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:57:41
I'LL KEEP THIS QUICK.
JUST SAYING THAT I AM IN FAVOR
OF THIS ITEM,

[Captioner] 19:57:45
 AND I WANT TO
POINT OUT TO THE COMMENTER WHO
WAS

[Captioner] 19:57:48
 CONCERNED ABOUT THE COST
THAT THE FISCAL IMPACT IS LISTED
AS

[Captioner] 19:57:51
 NONE BECAUSE THERE'S NO COST
TO THE CITY FOR THIS.
WE DESPERATELY

[Captioner] 19:57:54
 NEED THIS
AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND I HOPE
YOU'LL APPROVE IT.


[Captioner] 19:57:57
THANK YOU.
>> Ms. Gauthier: THANK YOU.
THAT'S THE LAST SPEAKER.


[Captioner] 19:58:00
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
AND I'LL TURN IT BACK --

[Captioner] 19:58:03
 I'LL
CLOSE THE PUBLIC

[Captioner] 19:58:06
 HEARING.
AND WERE THERE ANY WRITTEN


[Captioner] 19:58:10
COMMENTS ON PROPOSED TAX EXEMPT


[Captioner] 19:58:13
BONDS OR OTHER PROJECT RECEIVED
BY THE CLERK?
THANK

[Captioner] 19:58:16
 YOU.
AND SO AS I CLOSE THE PUBLIC
HEARING, I'LL

[Captioner] 19:58:19
 TURN IT BACK FOR
COMMENTS FROM THE
COUNCILMEMBERS.


[Captioner] 19:58:22
I'M HAPPY TO ADD SOME COMMENTS
TOO.
COUNCILMEMBER KENG.


[Captioner] 19:58:27
>> Vice Mayor Keng: THANK YOU,MADAME MAYOR.


[Captioner] 19:58:30
INDEED WE ALL KNOW HIGH COST OF
LIVING AND HOUSING IN THE


[Captioner] 19:58:33
REGION, THAT WE'RE NOT BUILDING 
THIS MUCH

[Captioner] 19:58:37
 NEEDED AFFORDABLE
HOUSING UNITS FAST ENOUGH.
I THINK IF WE CAN HAVE A

[Captioner] 19:58:40
 STAFF
MEMBER ADDRESS SOME OF

[Captioner] 19:58:43
 THE
CONFUSION, CLARIFY BL THE

[Captioner] 19:58:47
 FISCAL
IMPACT SINCE IN THE ESTIMATED
SOURCES

[Captioner] 19:58:53
 OF FUNDS IT'S LISTED
UNDER CITY OF FREMONT HOUSING


[Captioner] 19:58:56
LOAN $6 MILLION, SO MAYBE THAT'S
WHERE PEOPLE ARE NOT CLEAR
WHETHER FREMONT IS

[Captioner] 19:58:59
 PAYING FOR
THIS OR NOT.


[Captioner] 19:59:02
>> Ms. Briggs: THANK YOU,
COUNCILMEMBER.
WE HAVE OUR FINANCE DIRECTOR AND


[Captioner] 19:59:05
HOUSING MANAGER BOTH AVAILABLE
FOR QUESTIONS.
THIS IS A BOND ISSUANCE

[Captioner] 19:59:08
 AS THE
MAYOR MENTIONED AND THE LOAN YOU
ARE

[Captioner] 19:59:12
 REFERRING TO IS A PREVIOUSLY
APPROVED LOAN, BUT I'LL ASK OUR


[Captioner] 19:59:15
FINANCE DIRECTOR PERHAPS TO ADD.
>> Mayor Mei: DIRECTOR

[Captioner] 19:59:19

PERSSELIN, WAS THIS ONE OF OUR
NOFA

[Captioner] 19:59:22
 FUNDINGS?
>> Mr. Persselin: SO I CAN


[Captioner] 19:59:26
ACTUALLY LET LUCIA HUGHES

[Captioner] 19:59:28
 TALK
ABOUT IT AS IT'S PREVIOUSLY BEEN
APPROVED.


[Captioner] 19:59:32
>> Mayor Mei: WELCOME, LUCY A,

[Captioner] 19:59:35
 LUCIA.
>> YOU ARE CORRECT, THIS IS PART


[Captioner] 19:59:38
OF THE NOFA FUNDING AT THE CITY
PROVIDED

[Captioner] 19:59:41
 A $6 MILLION LOAN.
>> Mayor Mei: AND COULD YOU
CLARIFY FOR THE PUBLIC TOO WHAT


[Captioner] 19:59:44
A NOFA IS?
IT'S A NOTICE OF FUNDING
AVAILABILITY

[Captioner] 19:59:47
 THAT I BELIEVE --
IF YOU WANT TO CLARIFY

[Captioner] 19:59:51
 WHERE THE
FUNDING COMES FROM?
>>

[Captioner] 19:59:54
 YES, NOTICE OF FUNDING
AVAILABILITY BACK IN 2021 THAT


[Captioner] 19:59:57
WE ISSUED, AND THE CITY COUNCIL
DECIDED

[Captioner] 20:00:00
 TO FUND THREE PROJECTS.
THIS PROJECT IS ONE OF THEM.


[Captioner] 20:00:05
AND THE PROCESS WAS THE
DEVELOPERS, THEY

[Captioner] 20:00:08
 NEED TO SUBMIT
A COMPETITIVE PROPOSAL

[Captioner] 20:00:11
 AND THEN
STAFF AND CONSULTANTS LOOK AT
THE

[Captioner] 20:00:14
 PROPOSALS AND THEN RECOMMEND


[Captioner] 20:00:17
FUNDING TO THE CITY COUNCIL.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
AND I BELIEVE THAT ALSO

[Captioner] 20:00:21
 TO
CLARIFY WHERE THE FUNDING COMES


[Captioner] 20:00:24
FROM, AT TIMES

[Captioner] 20:00:27
 THERE'S BEEN --
SOME OF THE OTHER IN LIEU FEES,
AND WHAT WE'VE

[Captioner] 20:00:30
 DONE AS A CITY
WITH SOME OF THE GROWTH THAT
WE'VE SEEN IS THAT WE'VE HAD A


[Captioner] 20:00:33
PERCENTAGE OF FUNDING THAT WAS
ALLOCATED

[Captioner] 20:00:36
 SPECIFICALLY TO BE
ABLE TO BE COBBLED TOGETHER, AND
SOME

[Captioner] 20:00:39
 OF THESE PROJECTS THEN
RESULT IN A PROJECT LIKE

[Captioner] 20:00:42
 THIS
ONE, TO BE

[Captioner] 20:00:46
 ABLE TO PRODUCE THE
FINANCING BECAUSE WHILE WE AS A
COUNCIL ARE

[Captioner] 20:00:49
 DOING THE
ENTITLEMENT AND APPROVAL

[Captioner] 20:00:53
 OF
THESE FOR OUR GENERAL PLAN
GUIDELINES OR OTHER AMENDMENTS,


[Captioner] 20:00:56
OTHER PLANNED DISTRICTS, NOT
ALWAYS IS THE FUNDING

[Captioner] 20:00:59
 FULLY
AVAILABLE SO THERE WE'RE ABLE TO
UTILIZE AND PULL SOME OF THE


[Captioner] 20:01:02
FUNDING TOGETHER LIKE WE DID
WITH THIS CASE WITH THREE
PROJECTS TO

[Captioner] 20:01:06
 PROVIDE A NOFA
FUNDING, WHICH IS WHY IT'S NOT


[Captioner] 20:01:10
DIRECTLY COUNTING THE GENERAL
FUNDING AND IF THAT'S INCORRECT,


[Captioner] 20:01:13
DIRECTOR PERSSELIN, IF THERE'S
ANYTHING YOU WANT TO CLARIFY.


[Captioner] 20:01:17
BUT WHAT WE'RE APPROVING TONIGHT
IS TO HOLD A

[Captioner] 20:01:20
 PUBLIC HEARING AND
TO ADOPT A RESOLUTION

[Captioner] 20:01:24
 APPROVING
THE ISSUANCE OF THE MULTIFAMILY
HOUSING REVENUE

[Captioner] 20:01:27
 BONDS BY THE
CALIFORNIA MUNICIPAL FINANCE
NORTH FOR THE

[Captioner] 20:01:30
 PURPOSE OF
SPECIFICALLY FINANCING THIS


[Captioner] 20:01:34
AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECT.
AND I KNOW THERE WERE COMMENTS
ALSO ABOUT

[Captioner] 20:01:37
 THE DIFFERENT
AFFORDABILITY LEVELS, AND IN THE
STAFF

[Captioner] 20:01:40
 REPORT, IT DOES BREAK
THROUGH SOME OF THE DIFFERENT


[Captioner] 20:01:43
ALLOCATIONS OF NUMBER OF UNITS
THAT ARE ALLOCATED BASED

[Captioner] 20:01:46
 OFF OF
THE LOCAL AREA MEDIAN INCOME.
AND WHILE I

[Captioner] 20:01:50
 KNOW THAT HOUSINGAFFORDABILITY IS SOMETIMES A
QUESTION,

[Captioner] 20:01:53
 WHEN IT COMES TO THE
LOCAL AREA MEDIAN HOUSING

[Captioner] 20:01:56

INCOMES AND WHAT CONSTITUTES
AFFORDABLE OR

[Captioner] 20:02:01
 NON-AFORPDABLE
THOUSANDSING, IF YOU COULD
CORRECT OR JUST

[Captioner] 20:02:05
 IDENTIFY, LUCIA,
IT'S SET BY THE STATE, NOT THE
CITY OF

[Captioner] 20:02:07
 FREMONT.
>> IT IS SET BY THE STATE AND
IT'S SUBJECT TO CHANGE EVERY


[Captioner] 20:02:10
YEAR.
>> Mayor Mei: YES.
AND SO

[Captioner] 20:02:14
 THAT'S HOW THAT COMES
ABOUT FOR SOME OF THE QUESTIONS
THAT

[Captioner] 20:02:17
 HAD COME FROM THE

[Captioner] 20:02:22
 PUBLIC.
I SEE NEXT COUNCILMEMBER SHAO,
DID YOU HAVE A QUESTION

[Captioner] 20:02:24
 OR
COMMENT ON THIS?
>> Councilmember Shao: THANK


[Captioner] 20:02:27
YOU, MAYOR.
I HAVE SOME COMMENTS.
I NOTICED THAT A LOT OF

[Captioner] 20:02:31
 PEOPLE
WOULD BE PREOCCUPIED WITH THE
IDEA

[Captioner] 20:02:34
 THAT THIS PROJECT IS SOLELY
FOR

[Captioner] 20:02:39
 HOMELESS PEOPLE.
ACTUALLY IF YOU LOOK AT THE
WHOLE PROJECT, IT IS TO HELP THE


[Captioner] 20:02:43
LOW INCOME

[Captioner] 20:02:46
 FAMILIES IN THE ALAMEDA COUNTY.
BY

[Captioner] 20:02:50
 WORKING ON THE HOUSING
COMMISSION IN THE HOUSING


[Captioner] 20:02:54
AUTHORITY OF THE COUNTY OF
ALAMEDA, ALSO

[Captioner] 20:02:58
 KNOWN AS HACA, WE
HAVE

[Captioner] 20:03:01
 USED SO MANY DIFFERENT
TYPES OF FUNDS FROM THE

[Captioner] 20:03:07
 FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT IN FORMS SUCH AS
VOUCHERS TO HELP LOW

[Captioner] 20:03:10
 INCOME


[Captioner] 20:03:13
FAMILIES IN THE COUNTY OF
ALAMEDA BY

[Captioner] 20:03:16
 PROVIDING SUCH
FINANCIAL SUPPORT, WE


[Captioner] 20:03:19
SUCCESSFULLY PREVENT THEM FROM
BECOMING HOMELESS.
AND

[Captioner] 20:03:22
 I BELIEVE THAT THIS PROJECT


[Captioner] 20:03:26
IS ALSO MEANT TO PREVENT MORE


[Captioner] 20:03:29
AND MORE INDIVIDUALS AND
FAMILIES FROM BECOMING

[Captioner] 20:03:32
 HOMELESS.
THAT'S WHY YOU SEE THAT THE


[Captioner] 20:03:35
PROJECT HAS NOT ONLY

[Captioner] 20:03:39
 STUDIOS BUT
ALSO 2 BEDROOM AND

[Captioner] 20:03:41
 3 BEDROOM
UNITS AND THE RENTS WILL BE
SUBSIDIZED.


[Captioner] 20:03:44
SO I THINK THIS IS THE

[Captioner] 20:03:47
 RIGHT
WAY.
WE DEFINITELY WILL TRY TO GATHER


[Captioner] 20:03:50
ALL THE RESOURCES TO HELP THE
HOMELESS, BUT IN THE

[Captioner] 20:03:53
 MEANTIME S
WE ALSO NEED TO BE SMART AND
THEN HELP

[Captioner] 20:03:58
 THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE
ABOUT TO BECOME

[Captioner] 20:04:01
 HOMELESS IF --
WITHOUT HELP FROM

[Captioner] 20:04:04
 US.
MY ONLY COMMENT ON THIS PROJECT
OR

[Captioner] 20:04:08
 ACTUALLY TWO COMMENTS, IN
TERMS OF LOCATION I THINK IT'S A
VERY GOOD LOCATION.


[Captioner] 20:04:11
IT'S LOCATED CLOSE TO

[Captioner] 20:04:17
 THE FUTURE
IRVINGTON BART STATION, SO
TRANSPORTATION CERTAINLY IS


[Captioner] 20:04:20
GOING TO BE HELPFUL

[Captioner] 20:04:23
  FOR THOSE
LOW INCOME

[Captioner] 20:04:26
 FAMILIES IF THEY CAN
RELY ON PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION.
SECOND

[Captioner] 20:04:30
 COMMENT IS THAT SINCE THE
CITY OF FREMONT REALLY

[Captioner] 20:04:33
 PROVIDED
LONG AND ALL KINDS OF

[Captioner] 20:04:36
 SUPPORT TO
INCLUDE THIS PROJECT AS PART

[Captioner] 20:04:39
 OF
OUR HUGE PLAN TO HELP THE LOW
INCOME

[Captioner] 20:04:45
 FAMILIES AND HOMELESS
PEOPLE, I WOULD PROPOSE THAT
WHEN WE

[Captioner] 20:04:48
 SCREEN APPLICANTS FOR


[Captioner] 20:04:51
TENANTS, WE SHOULD PUT FREMONT


[Captioner] 20:04:55
FAMILIES AS A PRIORITY INSTEAD
OF

[Captioner] 20:04:58
 JUST TO FAMILIES

[Captioner] 20:05:01
 ALL OVER THE
COUNTY OF ALAMEDA.
AFTER ALL, WE HAVE TO

[Captioner] 20:05:04
 HELP
PEOPLE WHO ARE RIGHT NOW
SUFFERING IN THE CITY

[Captioner] 20:05:07
 OF
FREMONT.
SO THIS IS

[Captioner] 20:05:10
 HOW WE SHOULD USE OUR
FREMONT

[Captioner] 20:05:13
 TAXPAYERS' MONEY BETTER
TO HELP THE LOCAL PEOPLE.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:05:17
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
REGARDING THE QUESTION OF
SCREENING, I DON'T KNOW

[Captioner] 20:05:20
 IF
LUCIA, IF YOU COULD KINDLY SHARE
HOW

[Captioner] 20:05:24
 THAT PROCESS WORKS RIGHT NOW
IN TERMS OF PLACEMENT.
THANK

[Captioner] 20:05:25
 YOU.
>> YES.
ABSOLUTELY.


[Captioner] 20:05:29
SO THE CITY HAS A LONG-STANDING


[Captioner] 20:05:33
PRACTICE OF PRIORITIZING
AFFORDABLE

[Captioner] 20:05:36
 UNITS FOR PEOPLE THAT
LIVE OR WORK IN FREMONT,

[Captioner] 20:05:39
 AND
THIS PROJECT IS NO EXCEPTION.
SO WHEN

[Captioner] 20:05:44
 THIS PROJECT WAS READY
TO COME ONLINE, THERE WILL

[Captioner] 20:05:47
 BE AN
APPLICATION PROCESS AND THERE
WILL BE A LOTTERY PROCESS.


[Captioner] 20:05:51
AND THE PEOPLE THAT LIVE OR WORK
IN FREMONT

[Captioner] 20:05:54
 WILL BE PRIORITIZED
FOR UNITS.


[Captioner] 20:05:59
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
NEXT IS COUNCILMEMBER COX.


[Captioner] 20:06:05
>> Councilmember Cox: ACTUALLY
I'D HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE THINGS
THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN

[Captioner] 20:06:08
 STATED,
BUT IT'S TRULY AN HONOR TO HAVE
IT IN

[Captioner] 20:06:12
 DISTRICT 6, BUT ALSO
HOPING THAT WE CAN SPREAD THIS


[Captioner] 20:06:15
TYPE OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING TO
OTHER PARTS

[Captioner] 20:06:18
 OF FREMONT, SO THAT
WE CAN ADDRESS

[Captioner] 20:06:21
 THIS ISSUE OF
HOMELESSNESS AND

[Captioner] 20:06:23
 PROVIDING A
QUALITY OF LIFE FOR OUR
RESIDENTS.


[Captioner] 20:06:28
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
I WAS ALSO GOING TO

[Captioner] 20:06:30
 REALLY
QUICKLY MENTION THAT FOR THOSE
WHO DON'T KNOW, FREMONT IS A


[Captioner] 20:06:34
LITTLE UNIQUE THAT WE HAVE
ORIGINALLY PUT A PLANNED
DISTRICT SPECIFICALLY

[Captioner] 20:06:37
 FOR
55-PLUS, AND THAT'S RIGHT
ADJACENT DIRECTLY

[Captioner] 20:06:41
 TO OUR SENIOR
HOUSING AND OUR NEW

[Captioner] 20:06:45
 AGE WELL
CENTER IN DISTRICT 35.
AND SO RIGHT THERE,

[Captioner] 20:06:48
 WE HAD PUT
IN 500 UNITS OF SENIOR HOUSING,
AND

[Captioner] 20:06:51
 THE FIRST PIECE, WHICH I'M
REALLY PROUD THAT WE WERE ABLE
TO

[Captioner] 20:06:54
 COMPLETE, AND THANK YOU TO
THE STAFF AND THOSE WHO HELPED
WITH US, WAS THE PAULINE

[Captioner] 20:06:58
 WEAVER
SENIOR APARTMENTS, WHICH I THINK
WAS VERY CRITICAL TO PUT

[Captioner] 20:07:02
 THAT
FIRST IN TO SHOW OUR SUPPORT
SPECIFICALLY FOR THE

[Captioner] 20:07:05
 SENIORS.
AND WE HAVE A MOTION

[Captioner] 20:07:07
 BY
COUNCILMEMBER COX AND DO I HAVE
A SECOND?


[Captioner] 20:07:12
OKAY, SECOND BY COUNCILMEMBER
KENG, I SEE ALSO ON THIS.


[Captioner] 20:07:16
DO YOU HAVE ANY -- THAT WAS JUST
FOR THE MOTION, RIGHT?
OKAY.


[Captioner] 20:07:19
THANK YOU.
SO I HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND.
IF I COULD HAVE A

[Captioner] 20:07:22
 VOTE, PLEASE.


[Captioner] 20:07:30
AND THE MOTION CARRIES
UNANIMOUSLY.


[Captioner] 20:07:35
THE NEXT ITEM I THINK MAY BE A
LITTLE BIT LONG.
WE'RE

[Captioner] 20:07:38
 AT 8:10 RIGHT NOW, AND I
DON'T KNOW IF IT WOULD BE OKAY,
LET'S CALL A

[Captioner] 20:07:41
 QUICK FIVE-MINUTE
BREAK, IS THAT OKAY?
BECAUSE I THINK IT WILL BE MORE


[Captioner] 20:07:44
THAN 8:30, SO LET'S CALL A QUICK
FIVE-MINUTE BREAK BECAUSE I
THINK THE

[Captioner] 20:07:47
 BUDGET AND YEAR-END
REPORT WILL DEFINITELY BE MORE
THAN 20

[Captioner] 20:07:50
 MINUTES.
AND SO WE'LL TAKE A QUICK --
WE'LL --

[Captioner] 20:07:52
 ACTUALLY WE'LL COME
BACK AT 8:15.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:17:02
>> Mayor Mei: GOOD

[Captioner] 20:17:08
 EVENING.
SO LET'S RETURN.


[Captioner] 20:17:13
AT THIS TIME, WE'RE GOING TO
RETURN TO THE NEXT AGENDA ITEM,
WHICH

[Captioner] 20:17:16
 IS ITEM 7A, WHICH IS THE
FISCAL

[Captioner] 20:17:20
 YEAR 2021-2022 YEAR-END
REPORT

[Captioner] 20:17:24
 AND 2022-2023 BUDGET
UPDATE.


[Captioner] 20:17:29
AND SO I BELIEVE OUR FINANCE
DIRECTOR, DAVE PERSSELIN,

[Captioner] 20:17:30
 WILL
PROVIDE A PRESENTATION THIS
EVENING.


[Captioner] 20:17:34
WELCOME, DIRECTOR PERSSELIN.
>> Mr. Persselin: THANK YOU,
MAYOR

[Captioner] 20:17:37
 MEI.
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO REMAIN OFF
SCREEN TONIGHT AS I'M HAVING


[Captioner] 20:17:41
SOME CONNECTIVITY CHALLENGES.


[Captioner] 20:17:44
TONIGHT I'LL BE REVIEWING OUR
GENERAL FUND OPERATING RESULTS
FOR

[Captioner] 20:17:47
 LAST FISCAL YEAR,
RECOMMENDING APPROPRIATE


[Captioner] 20:17:52

APPROPRIATION OF THE ENDING FUND
BALANCE AND

[Captioner] 20:17:55
 REPORTING ON BUDGET
ACTIONS TAKEN PURSUANT TO THE
CITY COUNCIL'S

[Captioner] 20:17:58
 DELEGATION OF
AUTHORITY TO THE CITY MANAGER.
I'LL ALSO PROVIDE

[Captioner] 20:18:01
 A BRIEF UPDATE
ON CURRENT-YEAR REVENUE AND


[Captioner] 20:18:05
EXPENDITURE

[Captioner] 20:18:08
 PROJECTIONS.
THE AUDIT OF THE CITY'S FISCAL


[Captioner] 20:18:12
YEAR 2021-22 FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS BY AN INDEPENDENT


[Captioner] 20:18:15
CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
IS UNDERWAY.
AND

[Captioner] 20:18:18
 THE ANNUAL COMPREHENSIVE
FINANCIAL REPORT, INCLUDING

[Captioner] 20:18:21
 THE
AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, IS
EXPECTED TO BE

[Captioner] 20:18:25
 AVAILABLE BY
DECEMBER 31ST.
TO

[Captioner] 20:18:28
 PROVIDE THE CITY COUNCIL WITH
MORE TIMELY INFORMATION ABOUT


[Captioner] 20:18:31
THE YEAR JUST COMPLETED, WE HAVE
PREPARED THE

[Captioner] 20:18:34
 FOLLOWING
INFORMATION USING UNAUDITED
AMOUNTS.


[Captioner] 20:18:37
WE'LL REPORT ON ANY MATERIAL
AUDIT ADJUSTMENTS AT

[Captioner] 20:18:40
 THE TIME
THE ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT IS
PROVIDED TO THE CITY COUNCIL.


[Captioner] 20:18:46
WE UPDATE OUR REVENUE
PROJECTIONS THROUGHOUT THE YEAR
AS WE

[Captioner] 20:18:49
 RECEIVE NEW INFORMATION.
FOR EXAMPLE,

[Captioner] 20:18:52
 WE USE THE FISCAL
YEAR

[Captioner] 20:18:56
 2021-22 MID-YEAR REPORT IN
MARCH TO INCREASE OUR SALES

[Captioner] 20:18:59
 TAX
PROJECTION TO REFLECT HIGHER
THAN ANTICIPATED REVENUE

[Captioner] 20:19:03
 FROM
NEW AUTO SALES.
WE LAST

[Captioner] 20:19:06
 ESTIMATED FISCAL YEAR
2021-22 GENERAL FUND

[Captioner] 20:19:09
 REVENUES IN
EARLY MAY AS PART OF THE

[Captioner] 20:19:12
 GENERAL
FUND FORECAST, INCLUDED IN THE
FISCAL

[Captioner] 20:19:16
 YEAR 2022-23 PROPOSED
BUDGET

[Captioner] 20:19:21
 PRESENTATION.
AT THAT TIME, WE ONLY HAD
PARTIAL YEAR INFORMATION

[Captioner] 20:19:24
 FOR
MOST OF OUR REVENUES.
OVER THE

[Captioner] 20:19:28
 LAST FOUR MONTHS, WE'VE
RECEIVED THE REMAINING PAYMENTS


[Captioner] 20:19:31
WHICH HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY
INCREASED THE

[Captioner] 20:19:37
 ESTIMATE.
THE MAJOR CHANGES TO OUR REVENUE
ESTIMATE

[Captioner] 20:19:40
 RELATE AT LEAST IN PART
TO THE

[Captioner] 20:19:43
 UNUSUALLY STRONG
RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE MARKET,
AND BUSINESSES

[Captioner] 20:19:47
 PAYING PRIOR-YEAR
DELINQUENT BUSINESS TAXES.


[Captioner] 20:19:50
THE FINAL INSTALLMENT OF
PROPERTY TAX PAYMENTS FROM THE


[Captioner] 20:19:54
COUNTY IN AUGUST INCLUDED FOUR
MONTHS OF

[Captioner] 20:19:57
 SUPPLEMENTAL PROPERTY
TAX, WHICH OUTPERFORMED THE

[Captioner] 20:20:00
 MAY
ESTIMATE BY ALMOST $900,000.


[Captioner] 20:20:04
WITH AN ADDITIONAL $400,000


[Captioner] 20:20:07
COMING FROM THE SECURED AND
UNSECURED

[Captioner] 20:20:10
 TAX ROLLS.
THE LAST TWO MONTHS OF BUSINESS


[Captioner] 20:20:13
TAX REVENUE EXCEEDED OUR
ESTIMATE

[Captioner] 20:20:17
 BY $1.3 MILLION.
THE MAGNITUDE OF THESE

[Captioner] 20:20:21
 INCREASES
TO OUR ESTIMATE ISN'T

[Captioner] 20:20:24
 UNUSUAL,
GIVEN THE LIMITED INFORMATION ON
WHICH THE ESTIMATE IS

[Captioner] 20:20:27
 BASED.
HOWEVER, THE LAST

[Captioner] 20:20:30
 QUARTER OF
2021-22 SALES TAX

[Captioner] 20:20:34
 REVENUE
RECEIVED IN AUGUST EXCEED

[Captioner] 20:20:37
 EXCEEDED THE
AVERAGE OF THE PRIOR EIGHT
QUARTERS

[Captioner] 20:20:40
 BY ABOUT $8 MILLION.
MOST OF

[Captioner] 20:20:44
 THAT UNANTICIPATED
REVENUE WAS IN THE NEW AUTO


[Captioner] 20:20:48
SALES CATEGORY.
OUR UNUSUALLY HIGH AUTO SALES


[Captioner] 20:20:52
REVENUE THEN HAD A MULTIPLIER
EFFECT, BECAUSE OUR SHARE OF


[Captioner] 20:20:56
COUNTY-WIDE POOLED SALES TAX
REVENUE IS

[Captioner] 20:20:59
 DETERMINED EACH
QUARTER BY OUR PORTION OF


[Captioner] 20:21:02
COUNTY-WIDE POINT OF SALE
REVENUE.


[Captioner] 20:21:08
I'M GOING TO FOCUS FOR A MOMENT
ON OUR NEW AUTO SALES

[Captioner] 20:21:11
 TAX
REVENUE BECAUSE LATER IN THE
PRESENTATION, I'LL BE MAKING A


[Captioner] 20:21:15
RECOMMENDATION RELATED TO THE
QUARTER OVER QUARTER VOLATILITY
YOU CAN SEE

[Captioner] 20:21:18
 ON THIS SLIDE.
OUR

[Captioner] 20:21:22
 YEAR-END ESTIMATE FOR NEW
AUTO SALES WAS

[Captioner] 20:21:25
 BASED ON THE
EIGHT QUARTER MOVING AVERAGE
THROUGH THE SECOND QUARTER,


[Captioner] 20:21:28
SHOWN AS A RED DIAMOND ON THE
CHART.


[Captioner] 20:21:32
THE EIGHT QUARTER MOVING AVERAGE
IS INTENDED TO PICK UP ANY

[Captioner] 20:21:35
 TREND
IN THE HISTORICAL DATA WHILE
PROTECTING

[Captioner] 20:21:38
 US FROM WHAT WOULD
OTHERWISE BE SIGNIFICANT OVER

[Captioner] 20:21:42
 OR
UNDERESTIMATING IF WE WERE ONLY
TO LOOK AT THE MOST

[Captioner] 20:21:45
 RECENT ONE
OR TWO QUARTERS.
AS YOU

[Captioner] 20:21:51
 CAN SEE, THE 2021-223RD


[Captioner] 20:21:54
QUARTER SALES TAX REVENUES
RECEIVED IN LATE MAY WERE


[Captioner] 20:21:58
CONSISTENT WITH OUR FORECAST


[Captioner] 20:22:00
ESTIMATE.
HOWEVER, IN LATE AUGUST WE
RECEIVED THE FOURTH QUARTER


[Captioner] 20:22:05
REVENUES, WHICH ARE MORE THAN
DOUBLE THE ESTIMATE.


[Captioner] 20:22:10
THE DROP FROM THE SECOND QUARTER
TO THE THIRD QUARTER AND THEN
THE JUMP FROM THE THIRD

[Captioner] 20:22:13
 QUARTER
TO THE FOURTH QUARTER
ILLUSTRATES

[Captioner] 20:22:17
 THE CHALLENGE WE
FACE IN ESTIMATING FUTURE SALES
TAX

[Captioner] 20:22:24
 REVENUE.
THERE ARE TWO POINTS TO TAKE
AWAY ON THIS SLIDE.


[Captioner] 20:22:28
FIRST WE'RE INCREASING OUR SALES
TAX ESTIMATE FOR THIS YEAR

[Captioner] 20:22:30
 AND
FUTURE YEARS TO REFLECT THE
UPDATED MOVING AVERAGE.


[Captioner] 20:22:34
BUT SECOND, WE SHOULD EXPECT
SIGNIFICANT

[Captioner] 20:22:38
 VARIATION BETWEEN
WHAT WE FORECAST AND WHAT WE


[Captioner] 20:22:41
ACTUALLY RECEIVE.
THAT'S WHY WE HAVE A

[Captioner] 20:22:44
 BUDGET
UNCERTAINTY

[Captioner] 20:22:49
 RESERVE.
AS YOU CAN SEE, OUR ACTUAL
CLKTIONS

[Captioner] 20:22:53

COLLECTIONS OUT PERFORM THE
ESTIMATE

[Captioner] 20:22:57
 BY $12.5 MILLION.
AS I MENTIONED, THE LARGEST
CONTRIBUTOR TO THAT

[Captioner] 20:23:00
 WAS SALES
TAX, WITH PROPERTY TAX AND
BUSINESS TAX

[Captioner] 20:23:04
 ALSO PERFORMING
BETTER THAN

[Captioner] 20:23:08
 ANTICIPATED.
WHILE NOT PARTICULARLY A LARGE
CONTRIBUTION IN ABSOLUTE

[Captioner] 20:23:11

DOLLARS, IT'S ENCOURAGING TO SEE
THAT OUR HOTEL TAX

[Captioner] 20:23:15
 REVENUE ALSO
BE ITS ESTIMATE.
AS

[Captioner] 20:23:18
 NOTED ON THE SLIDE, THE
AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN

[Captioner] 20:23:22
 ACT FISCAL
RECOVERY FUNDS WE RECEIVED FROM
THE FEDERAL

[Captioner] 20:23:25
 GOVERNMENT IN 2021
AND

[Captioner] 20:23:29
 2021-22 ARE INCLUDED IN THE
OTHER REVENUE CATEGORY.


[Captioner] 20:23:39
THE EXPENDITURE ESTIMATE
INCLUDED IN THE GENERAL FUND
FORECAST ASSUMED WE WOULD MEET


[Captioner] 20:23:42
THE CITY-WIDE SAVINGS ESTIMATE
OF $11 MILLION.


[Captioner] 20:23:46
WE EXCEEDED THAT TARGET

[Captioner] 20:23:49
 BY WITH
$2.1 MILLION, BUT AS I'LL SHOW
ON THE NEXT

[Captioner] 20:23:53
 SLIDE, MOST OF THAT
ADDITIONAL

[Captioner] 20:23:55
 SAVINGS REPRESENTS
ENCUMBERED CONTRACTS THAT WILL
BE PAID NEXT YEAR.


[Captioner] 20:24:01
AS A REMINDER, THE 2020-21
BUDGET

[Captioner] 20:24:07
 INCORPORATED $12 MILLION
OF PANDEMIC-RELATED BUDGET
REDUCTIONS,

[Captioner] 20:24:11
 INCLUDING
CONTINUATION OF THE HIRING
FREEZE

[Captioner] 20:24:14
 THAT BEGAN IN MARCH 2020,
AND THE SUSPENSION OF

[Captioner] 20:24:17
 TRANSFERS
FOR STREET, PARK AND PUBLIC


[Captioner] 20:24:22
BUILDING MAINTENANCE.
WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF OUR FIRST
INSTALLMENT

[Captioner] 20:24:25
 OF ARPA FISCAL
RECOVERY FUNDS, IN THE

[Captioner] 20:24:28

2021-22 BUDGET, WE WERE ABLE TO
LIFT THE

[Captioner] 20:24:30
 HIRING FREEZE AND
RESTORE THE MAINTENANCE
TRANSFERS.


[Captioner] 20:24:35
THE COMBINATION OF UNUSUALLY
HIGH SALES TAX REVENUES

[Captioner] 20:24:39
 AND
UNEXPECTEDLY HIGH VACANCY RATES
THEN

[Captioner] 20:24:42
 ALLOWED US TO PROVIDE
FUNDING FOR CAPITAL

[Captioner] 20:24:45
 PROJECTS AND
MAKE AN ADDITIONAL CONTRIBUTION
TO PAY

[Captioner] 20:24:48
 DOWN THE CITY'S UNFUNDED
LIABILITY FOR

[Captioner] 20:24:51
 RETIREE
HEALTHCARE.
YOU CAN SEE THE IMPACT OF THOSE


[Captioner] 20:24:55
ACTIONS IN THE CAPITAL PROJECTS
AND

[Captioner] 20:24:59
 RETIREE HEALTHCARE TRUST
ROWS OF THIS SLIDE, BY COMPARING


[Captioner] 20:25:03
THE 0-DOLLAR TRANSFERS IN
2020-21 WITH

[Captioner] 20:25:06
 THE TRANSFERS IN
2021-22.


[Captioner] 20:25:16
WE FINISHED 2021 WITH

[Captioner] 20:25:19
 A
$26.1 MILLION OF UNRESERVED FUND
BALANCE, OF

[Captioner] 20:25:24
 WHICH $20 MILLION
WAS ARPA FISCAL RECOVERY FUNDS


[Captioner] 20:25:27
RECEIVED IN MAY 2021.
IN THE

[Captioner] 20:25:31
 ACTUALS COLUMN, YOU CAN
SEE THE REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE


[Captioner] 20:25:34
ESTIMATES WE JUST REVIEWED.
AS WELL AS

[Captioner] 20:25:37
 THE ADDITION OF
$1.4 MILLION

[Captioner] 20:25:41
 OF ENCUMBRANCES,
CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS THAT


[Captioner] 20:25:44
REMAIN UNSPENT AT YEAR-END, AND
SERVE

[Captioner] 20:25:58
 OF THE YEAR 
END REPORT, THE CITY COUNCIL WAS 
ABLE TO RESTORE

 WHICH 
CONSTITUTES MOST EVER OF THE

THE UNRESERVED FUND BALANCE 
ESTIMATE SHOWN

[Captioner] 20:26:18

THE ARPA FISCAL

[Captioner] 20:26:27

THAT WE RECEIVED IN MAY 2022.


[Captioner] 20:26:31
IN THE ACTUAL COLUMN YOU CAN SEE 
THAT OUR HIGHER

 REVENUES AND 
LOWER

[Captioner] 20:26:38
 EXPENDITURES LEAVE US WITH 
AN

[Captioner] 20:26:41

THE

ON THE OTHER HAND IS

[Captioner] 20:27:43
 MERNT AS A

[Captioner] 20:27:47
 
SHOCK ABSORBER.
THE COUNCIL ADOPTED

[Captioner] 20:27:50
 SPOT FOR 
THIS RESERVE IS TO FUND SANTA

[Captioner] 20:27:53
 
LEVEL CONSISTENT WITH THE

[Captioner] 20:27:57

 GOAL OF

AS PART OF LAST YEAR'S YEAR

[Captioner] 20:28:21
 INCREASE THE 
BUDGET UNCERTAINTY RESERVE TO $

[Captioner] 20:28:23

$10 MILLION.

[Captioner] 20:28:30
CONSISTENT WITH THE CITY 
COUNCIL'S ADOPTED BUDGET 
PRINCIPLES

[Captioner] 20:28:34
, STAFF WILL ARE 

[Captioner] 20:28:37
 BE 
RECOMMENDING THAT THE 13

[Captioner] 20:28:40
.2 
MILLION UNAVAILABLE 
UNANTICIPATED FUND

[Captioner] 20:28:43
 BALANCE BE 
ALLOCATED TO ONE TIME

[Captioner] 20:28:46
 USES.
AS I MENTIONED, THE BUDGET 
UNCERTAINTY

[Captioner] 20:28:49
 RESERVE IS DEPENDED 
TO OFF

[Captioner] 20:28:53
SET BUDGET UNCERTAINTY 
RESERVES, FROM UN

[Captioner] 20:28:57
ANTICIPATED 
COST INCREASES.
THE FUNDING LEFT IS DETERMINED

[Captioner] 20:29:00
 
BY MEASURING THE LEVEL OF 
FINANCIAL RISK OVER THE THREE

[Captioner] 20:29:04
 
YEAR FORECAST PERIOD.
RECOGNIZING BOTH THE IMPORTANCE 


[Captioner] 20:29:07
OF SALES TAX AND ITS INHERENT 
VOLATILITY

[Captioner] 20:29:11
 AS PART OF THE

[Captioner] 20:29:15
 
2019-20, THE

[Captioner] 20:29:20
 CITY COUNCIL 
INCREASED TO ROUGHLY THREE YEARS 
OF PROJECTED

[Captioner] 20:29:23
 SALES TAX GROWTH.
THE CURRENTS RESERVE LEVEL OF

[Captioner] 20:29:26
 
$10 MILLION IS CONSISTENT WITH 
THE THREE YEARS OF GROWTH 


[Captioner] 20:29:29
PROJECTED IN THE 2022-23 ADOPTED 
BUDGET FORECAST

[Captioner] 20:29:32
.
HOWEVER,

[Captioner] 20:29:36
 SEVERAL FACTORS SUGGEST 
THAT THE CITY COULD BE FACING

[Captioner] 20:29:39
 
EVEN GREATER BUDGETARY RISK OVER 
THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS

[Captioner] 20:29:42
.
FIRST, WE'VE EXPERIENCED

[Captioner] 20:29:46
 
SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER VOLATILITY 
IN SALES

[Captioner] 20:29:49
 TAX REVENUE OVER THE 
LAST 75 YEARS PARTICULARLY IN 
THE

[Captioner] 20:29:53
 NEW AUTO SALES CATEGORY.
SECOND, WE'RE

[Captioner] 20:29:57
 SEEING SUSTAINED 
HIGH INFLATION LEVELS THAT

[Captioner] 20:30:01
 COULD 
ULTIMATELY LEAD TO UNANTICIPATED 
INCREASES

[Captioner] 20:30:04
 IN COSTS FOR SERVICES 
AND SUPPLIES.


[Captioner] 20:30:09
FINALLY, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT 
IS

[Captioner] 20:30:13
 AGGRESSIVELY RAISING INTEREST 
RATES TO CURB INFLATION.

[Captioner] 20:30:16

THAT POTENTIALLY AT THE COST OF 
A RECESSION WHICH

[Captioner] 20:30:19
 COULD RESULT 
IN LOWER REVENUES TO THE CITY.
TO

[Captioner] 20:30:22
 ACCOMMODATE THOSE ADDITIONAL 
RISKS,

[Captioner] 20:30:26
 STAFF RECOMMENDS THE $2.5 
MILLION OF THE

[Captioner] 20:30:29
 UNANTICIPATED 
ENDING FUND BALANCE BE ALLOCATED 
TO

[Captioner] 20:30:32
 INCREASE THE BUDGET 
UNCERTAINTY RESERVE TO

[Captioner] 20:30:36
 $12.5 
MILLION.


[Captioner] 20:30:38
APPROXIMATELY 5% OF THE ADOPTED

[Captioner] 20:31:21
ALTHOUGH THE COST OF THESE

[Captioner] 20:31:24
 THE 
RESOURCES AVAILABLE, THE UN

[Captioner] 20:31:28

WERE RECEIVED

[Captioner] 20:32:53

[Captioner] 20:34:11
 THE NEW ASSESSMENT ROLL

APPROXIMATELY $1.8

ADDITIONALLY, THE TWO ADDITIONAL 
QUARTERS

BELIEVED WAS ONE

RELATED TO NEW AUTO SALES

 MONTHS 
OF PAYROLL DATA COMBINED WITH 
MORE

[Captioner] 20:34:48
 IN DEPTH ANALYSIS OF 
HISTORICAL

[Captioner] 20:34:51

[Captioner] 20:34:56
 EXPECT 
SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER VACANCY 
SAVINGS THAN PROJECT

[Captioner] 20:34:59
ED OVER THE 
NEXT SEVERAL YEARS.
THE COMBINATION OF

[Captioner] 20:35:02

 IS PROJECTED TO MORE 
THAN OFFSET THE ADDITIONAL URCH

 UN

[Captioner] 20:35:11

UNANTICIPATED LABOR COSTS OVER 
THE THREE YEAR FORECAST PERIOD 


[Captioner] 20:35:14
SO STAFF IS NOT RECOMMENDING ANY

AS PART OF THE 2022

[Captioner] 20:36:16
FUNNELED BALANCE TO INCREASE THE

DIRECTOR PERNLZ

[Captioner] 20:37:24
 PERSSELIN

[Captioner] 20:37:28
 AND FOR THEIR 
DUE DILIGENCE IN THIS AREA AND 
WE REALLY

[Captioner] 20:37:31
 APPRECIATE ALL THE 
THOUGHTFULNESS THAT'S BEEN PUT 
INTO

[Captioner] 20:37:34
 THE PROPOSALS AND HOW WE 
HAVE BEEN ABLE TO HAVE 
CONSISTENCY

[Captioner] 20:37:37
 IN HAVING A STRONG 
FINANCIAL REPORTING FOR THE LAST 
27 YEARS

[Captioner] 20:37:41
.
AND SO AT THIS TIME, I'D LIKE TO 
TURN IT FOR

[Captioner] 20:37:44
 COUNCILMEMBERS 
QUESTIONS.
AND I'LL BEGIN

[Captioner] 20:37:47
 WITH 
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN.


[Captioner] 20:37:52
>> Councilmember Kassan:   THANK 
YOU, THIS THE WONDERFUL NEWS, 
VERY GOOD

[Captioner] 20:37:56
 TO HEAR.
I DO HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT THE 
UPCOMING AUDIT.

[Captioner] 20:37:59

THERE HAVE BEEN SOME QUESTIONS 
FROM THE PUBLIC

[Captioner] 20:38:03
 ABOUT THE 
SITUATION WITH OUR FORMER CITY 
MANAGER

[Captioner] 20:38:07
.
AND I'M WONDERING IF THE AUDIT 
WILL INCLUDE

[Captioner] 20:38:10
 A REPORT REGARDING

[Captioner] 20:38:14
 
POSSIBLE MISALLOCATION OF FUNDS 
RELATED TO

[Captioner] 20:38:17
 THAT SITUATION.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:38:22
>> David Persselin:   THANKS, 
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN.
THAT

[Captioner] 20:38:25
 IS A BIG QUESTION AND IN 
FACT OUR

[Captioner] 20:38:29
 OUTSIDE AUDITOR HAS 
BEEN ENGAGED BY THE CITY AS A 
SEPARATE ENGAGE

[Captioner] 20:38:32
MENT TO ASSESS

[Captioner] 20:38:35
 
THE PURCHASE CARD PROGRAM AND 
MAKE RECOMMENDATION

[Captioner] 20:38:39
S.
AND WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF 
REVIEWING A

[Captioner] 20:38:42
 DRAFT, AND THAT 
SHOULD BE AVAILABLE PROBABLY 
WITHIN THE

[Captioner] 20:38:45
 NEXT MONTH.


[Captioner] 20:38:50
>> Councilmember Kassan:   OKAY 
SO I'M HEARING THAT THERE WILL 
BE RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING

[Captioner] 20:38:53
 
PREVENTING THIS FROM HAPPENING 
AGAIN.


[Captioner] 20:38:56
BUT I'M WONDERING IF THERE WILL 
BE A REPORT ON THE DETAILS THAT 
COULD BE AVAILABLE

[Captioner] 20:39:00
 TO THE PUBLIC 
REGARDING THE MISMANAGEMENT OR

[Captioner] 20:39:02
 
THE MISAPPROPRIATION THAT 
HAPPENED IN THE PAST.


[Captioner] 20:39:09
>> David Persselin:   THE 
ASSESSMENT BY THE OUTSIDE

[Captioner] 20:39:12
 
AUDITOR WAS TO LOOK AT OUR

[Captioner] 20:39:16
 
COMPLIANCE WITH OUR PURCHASE 
CARD PROCEDURES

[Captioner] 20:39:19
 AND TO IDENTIFY

[Captioner] 20:39:23
 
ANY OPPORTUNITIES FOR US TO MAKE

[Captioner] 20:39:26
 
IMPROVEMENTS, AND THAT'S WHAT 
WILL BE IN THE PUBLIC REPORT.


[Captioner] 20:39:31
>> Councilmember Kassan:   OKAY, 
SO IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE WILL NOT 
BE ANY

[Captioner] 20:39:35
 REPORT REGARDING WHAT 
HAPPENED

[Captioner] 20:39:39
 WITH OUR FORMER CITY 
MANAGER,

[Captioner] 20:39:43
 AND I'M NOT CERTAIN 
THAT IT'S CLEAR

[Captioner] 20:39:46
 THAT EVERYTHING 
WAS NECESSARILY JUST RELATED TO 
THAT

[Captioner] 20:39:49
 CARD.
I JUST -- I

[Captioner] 20:39:53
 WOULD REQUEST, AND I 
DON'T KNOW, YOU KNOW,

[Captioner] 20:39:56
 IF OTHERS 
WOULD SUPPORT THIS.
BUT I WOULD REQUEST THAT

[Captioner] 20:39:59
 WE DO 
PROVIDE A REPORT TO THE PUBLIC.
I THINK PEOPLE

[Captioner] 20:40:02
 DO DESERVE TO 
KNOW WHAT HAPPENED

[Captioner] 20:40:05
.
AND NOT ONLY KNOW WHAT

[Captioner] 20:40:08
 WE'RE 
GOING TO DO TO PREVENT IT IN THE 
FUTURE BUT TO ALSO HAVE A

[Captioner] 20:40:11
 
COMPLETE ACCOUNTING OF WHAT DID 
HAPPEN.

[Captioner] 20:40:14

THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:40:24
>> Mayor Mei:   NEXT ON OUR 
COUNCIL LIST

[Captioner] 20:40:28

[Captioner] 20:40:31
 COUNCILMEMBER 
SALWAN.
>> Councilmember Salwan:   THANK 


[Captioner] 20:40:34
YOU, MADAM MAYOR AND THANK YOU 
MR. PERSSELIN

[Captioner] 20:40:37
 FOR THE DETAILED 
REPORT.
I ALWAYS ENJOY

[Captioner] 20:40:40
 THESE BUDGET 
PRESENTATIONS.
COUPLE OF QUESTIONS.


[Captioner] 20:40:43
WHAT IS THE EXPLANATION FOR THE 
VOLATILITY OF

[Captioner] 20:40:47
 THE AUTO SALES?
IT SEEMS LIKE IT JUMPS A LOT

[Captioner] 20:40:50
.
IS THERE ANY EXPLANATION THAT 
CAN YOU OFFER THAT CAN

[Captioner] 20:40:54
 HELP 
SMOOTH US GOING FORWARD SO WE 
CAN PREDICT

[Captioner] 20:40:58
 IT BETTER?
>> David Persselin:   I WISH I 
HAD A

[Captioner] 20:41:01
 GOOD EXPLANATION.
IT IS VERY CHALLENGING FOR US TO

[Captioner] 20:41:04
 
IDENTIFY WHAT THE FACTORS ARE 
THAT CAUSE EITHER A BIG SPIKE OR 


[Captioner] 20:41:07
A BIG DROP.
AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHY I

[Captioner] 20:41:10
 MADE 
THE RECOMMENDATION TO INCREASE 
THE BUDGET UNCERTAINTY RESERVE

[Captioner] 20:41:14
.
BECAUSE THIS IS AN AREA WHERE WE 
JUST DON'T HAVE A LOT

[Captioner] 20:41:18
 OF INSIGHT 
OR INFORMATION THAT CAN HELP US.


[Captioner] 20:41:24
>> Councilmember Salwan:   OKAY.
AND

[Captioner] 20:41:27
 AS FAR AS THE UPCOMING 
RECESSION, ARE WE MAKING

[Captioner] 20:41:33
 ANY 
ADJUSTMENTS TO ANY OF OUR 
PROJECTIONS FOR A

[Captioner] 20:41:36
 POTENTIAL 
RECESSION OR SLOW DOWN?
>> David Persselin: 

[Captioner] 20:41:39
  SO TO BE 
CLEAR, WE AREN'T

[Captioner] 20:41:42
 CURRENTLY 
SEEING A RECESSION OR SLOW DOWN 
IN OUR REVENUE

[Captioner] 20:41:45
 STREAM.
WHAT WE DO KNOW IS

[Captioner] 20:41:49
 THAT THE 
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS INCREASING 
INTEREST

[Captioner] 20:41:52
 RATES IN AN ATTEMPT TO 
SLOW

[Captioner] 20:41:56
 OR REVERSE THE HIGH LEVELS 
OF INFLATION

[Captioner] 20:41:59
.
AND THAT MANY ECONOMISTS

[Captioner] 20:42:03
 ARE 
PROJECTING THAT THOSE HIGH 
INTEREST

[Captioner] 20:42:06
 RATES WILL BRING A 
RECESSION IN THE FUTURE

[Captioner] 20:42:10
.
AGAIN THIS IS PART OF THE REASON 
WHY WE'RE RECOMMENDING

[Captioner] 20:42:13
 THAT WE 
INCREASE THE BUDGET UNCERTAINTY 
RESERVE,

[Captioner] 20:42:16
 BUT AT THIS POINT, IT 
WOULDN'T MAKE SENSE FOR US

[Captioner] 20:42:20
 TO 
REDUCE SERVICES TO THE COMMUNITY 
BASED

[Captioner] 20:42:23
 ON SPECULATION, THAT A 
RECESSION WILL LAP

[Captioner] 20:42:30
 HAPPEN IN THE 
FUTURE AT SOME POINT.
>> Councilmember Salwan:   SO 


[Captioner] 20:42:33
WHAT IS THE APPROPRIATE RESPONSE 
IF THERE IS A SLOW DOWN?


[Captioner] 20:42:36
>> David Persselin:   SO IF 
THERE IS A SLOW DOWN DEPENDING 
ON WHEN IT

[Captioner] 20:42:39
 OCCURS, WE CAN 
OBVIOUSLY TAKE STEPS

[Captioner] 20:42:44
 TO MAKE 
CHANGES TO OUR BUDGET

[Captioner] 20:42:47
.
IN THE CASE I'LL JUST GO BACK TO 
WHAT HAPPENED WITH COVID

[Captioner] 20:42:50
.
WHEN COVID HIT, IN MARCH

[Captioner] 20:42:54
 OF 
2020, WE WERE ABLE TO

[Captioner] 20:42:57
 DRAW ON 
OUR BUDGET UNCERTAINTY RESERVE

[Captioner] 20:43:00
 
TO MAINTAIN SERVICES FOR THE 
REMAINDER OF

[Captioner] 20:43:03
 THAT FISCAL YEAR 
WHILE WE

[Captioner] 20:43:07
 IDENTIFIED $12 MILLION 
OF BUDGET REDUCTION

[Captioner] 20:43:10
S THAT WE 
INCLUDED IN THE NEXT YEAR

[Captioner] 20:43:13
'S 
BUDGET.
SO THAT'S PRETTY MUCH

[Captioner] 20:43:17
 THE 
APPROACH THAT WE WOULD PROBABLY 
TAKE.

[Captioner] 20:43:20

THAT'S, AGAIN, THE IDEA OF THE 
BUDGET UNCERTAINTY

[Captioner] 20:43:24
 RESERVE IS TO 
ALLOW US TO MAINTAIN SERVICES TO 
THE

[Captioner] 20:43:27
 COMMUNITY WHILE WE IDENTIFY 
AND, YOU KNOW,

[Captioner] 20:43:30
 TAKE MEASURED 
STEPS TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS TO OUR

[Captioner] 20:43:34
 
BUDGET ACCORDING TO WHAT THE 
CIRCUMSTANCES ARE.


[Captioner] 20:43:42
>> Councilmember Salwan:   SO 
MORE OR LESS THIS SOUNDS LIKE 
THE BUDGET

[Captioner] 20:43:45
 UNCERTAINTY RESERVE 
WILL BE THE WAY

[Captioner] 20:43:48
 WE'LL FUND ANY 
DEFICIENCIES AND THEN CORRECT IT 
OVER TIME IS

[Captioner] 20:43:51
 WHAT IT SOUNDS 
LIKE.
YEAH I HEAR THE

[Captioner] 20:43:55
 ASSISTANT CITY 
MANAGER NODDING HER HEAD SO THAT 
MAKES SENSE

[Captioner] 20:43:58
.
SO SPEAKING OF FED

[Captioner] 20:44:01
 RATE HIKES 
HOW WILL THAT AFFECT OUR DEBT 
THAT WE HAVE TO

[Captioner] 20:44:04
 PAY?
>> David Persselin:   ALL OF OUR 
DEBT

[Captioner] 20:44:07
 ISSUANCE IS FIXED RATE 
BONDS.

[Captioner] 20:44:11

SO THOSE RATES ARE FIXED, AND 
THEY ARE

[Captioner] 20:44:15
 NOT AFFECTED BY

[Captioner] 20:44:18
 THE 
INCREASES THAT YOU'RE SEEING IN 
THE, SAY

[Captioner] 20:44:22
, MORTGAGE MARKET OR 
OTHER INTEREST RATE MARKETS.


[Captioner] 20:44:26
>> Councilmember Salwan:   
THAT'S ENCOURAGING TO HEAR.


[Captioner] 20:44:29
THERE WAS NO MENTION ABOUT THE 
NEW FIRE ENGINE

[Captioner] 20:44:32
 SERVICE THAT WE 
SPOKE ABOUT.
IS THAT STILL HAPPENING OR

[Captioner] 20:44:35
 
WHAT'S THE STATUS ON THAT?
>> David Persselin:   YES

[Captioner] 20:44:39
, SO 
BECAUSE WE ARE NOT RECOMMENDING 
ANY

[Captioner] 20:44:42
 ADJUSTMENTS TO THE CURRENT 
YEAR ADOPTED BUDGET, WE ARE

[Captioner] 20:44:45
 
MOVING FORWARD WITH THE 
ACTIVATION OF THE NEW

[Captioner] 20:44:48
 FIRE 
ENGINE COMPANY.
>> Councilmember Salwan:   


[Captioner] 20:44:51
EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT.
CAN YOU DESCRIBE MORE ABOUT YOU 
MENTIONED

[Captioner] 20:44:55
 THE ENCUMBRANCE 
BALANCE OF APPROXIMATELY $

[Captioner] 20:44:59
20 
MILLION AND THE WAY I INTERPRET 
IT IS THAT THESE ARE

[Captioner] 20:45:02
 EXPENSES OR 
THINGS OWED.

[Captioner] 20:45:05

COULD YOU GIVE US MORE DETAILS 
ABOUT WHAT THESE ARE FROM

[Captioner] 20:45:08
?
FOR THE DIFFERENT CATEGORIES IN 
KIND OF HIGH

[Captioner] 20:45:11
 LEVEL FASHION?
>> David Persselin:   SURE.
SO AS I

[Captioner] 20:45:14
 MENTIONED ABOUT HALF OF 
THE TOTAL CITY-WIDE

[Captioner] 20:45:18
 ENCUMBRANCE 
BALANCE, SO THIS IS CITYWIDE, 
NOT IN THE

[Captioner] 20:45:21
 GENERAL FUND, RELATES 
TO OUR CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT FUNDS

[Captioner] 20:45:24
 
AND ACTUALLY ANOTHER LARGE 
PORTION RELATES TO OUR

[Captioner] 20:45:28
 GAS TAX 
FUNDS WHICH PROVIDE STREET 
MAINTENANCE SERVICES

[Captioner] 20:45:31
.
SO MOST OF THOSE ENCUMBRANCE

[Captioner] 20:45:34
S 
ARE RELATED TO CONTRACTS

[Captioner] 20:45:37
 THAT 
WE'VE ENTERED INTO WITH SERVICE 
PROVIDERS

[Captioner] 20:45:40
 OR CONTRACTORS FOR 
CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS

[Captioner] 20:45:43
.
AND THEY'RE BEING CARRIED OVER 
TO THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR

[Captioner] 20:45:46
.
IN THE GENERAL FUND ITSELF, 
THERE'S

[Captioner] 20:45:50
 ABOUT $1.4 MILLION OF 
ENCUMBRANCE

[Captioner] 20:45:53
S, AND ABOUT $600,000 
OF

[Captioner] 20:45:57
 THAT RELATES TO CONTRACTS FOR 
SOMETHING THAT

[Captioner] 20:46:00
 YOU MIGHT RECALL 
WHICH IS THAT WE'RE UPGRADING

[Captioner] 20:46:05
 
THE PUBLIC

[Captioner] 20:46:09
 RADIO ENCRYPTION 
CAPABILITIES

[Captioner] 20:46:12
 ON OUR PUBLIC 
SAFETY RADIOS.

[Captioner] 20:46:16

AND ABOUT $600,000 OF THAT $1

[Captioner] 20:46:19
.4 
MILLION IS THE CONTRACT FOR 
THOSE

[Captioner] 20:46:22
 ENCRYPTION SERVICES WHICH 
AGAIN, WASN'T COMPLETED IN

[Captioner] 20:46:26
 THE 
CURRENT YEAR.
SO WE'LL BE PAYING SOME

[Captioner] 20:46:29
 OF THAT 
NEXT FISCAL YEAR.
>> Councilmember Salwan:  

[Captioner] 20:46:32
 THANK 
YOU.
AND THERE WAS A MENTION OF AN

[Captioner] 20:46:35
 
ALLOCATION OF GENERAL FUND

[Captioner] 20:46:38
 
TRANSFER $10.SEN

[Captioner] 20:46:42
10.7 MILLION FOR 
CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT FUND.


[Captioner] 20:46:45
I UNDERSTAND TWO OF THEM, THE 
PARKS MASTER PLAN,

[Captioner] 20:46:48
 IS THAT FOR 
DESIGN OF THE MASTER PLAN OR 
IMPLEMENTATION

[Captioner] 20:46:51
 OF THINGS WE WANT 
TO SEE IN THE PARKS?
WHAT SPECIFICALLY

[Captioner] 20:46:54
 IS THAT GOING 
FOR?

[Captioner] 20:46:57

>> David Persselin:   SO THE

[Captioner] 20:47:00
 
$10.7 MILLION TRANSFER IS FOR 
TRANSFER

[Captioner] 20:47:04
 TO THE CAPITAL 
IMPROVEMENTS FUND.
STAFF WILL BE WORKING ON THE

[Captioner] 20:47:08
 
NEXT FIVE-YEAR CIP, START

[Captioner] 20:47:11
ING 
REALLY RIGHT NOW.
IT AGAINST

[Captioner] 20:47:14
 I

[Captioner] 20:47:17
 BEGINS IN THE FALL.
AND WE'LL BE

[Captioner] 20:47:20
 BRINGING TO THE 
COUNCIL A LIST OF RECOMMENDED 
CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS

[Captioner] 20:47:23
 
OVER THAT FIVE YEAR HORIZON, 
SOME OF WHICH WILL BE FUND

[Captioner] 20:47:25
ED 
FROM THE CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS 
FUND.


[Captioner] 20:47:28
SO WHAT WE'RE DOING IS, WE'RE 
MAKING

[Captioner] 20:47:32
 DOLLARS AVAILABLE FOR 
PROJECTS IN GENERAL, AND

[Captioner] 20:47:35
 THEN 
WE'RE GOING TO BE RETURNING TO 
COUNCIL WITH THE

[Captioner] 20:47:38
 CAPITAL 
IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM TO OBTAIN 
COUNCIL

[Captioner] 20:47:41
 APPROVAL FOR SPECIFIC 
PROJECTS.


[Captioner] 20:47:45
>> Councilmember Salwan:   THANK 
YOU.
SO THAT WILL BE PART OF THE CIP 


[Captioner] 20:47:47
CYCLE.
>> YES.
>> Councilmember Salwan:   


[Captioner] 20:47:50
EXCELLENT, YES.
AND LABORATORIES,

[Captioner] 20:47:54
 LAST BUT NOT LEAST,

[Captioner] 20:47:57
 I G

[Captioner] 20:48:00
 GUESS 
I'M CHIME IN TOO, LOOK

[Captioner] 20:48:05
ING TO 
WHAT HAPPENED DURING THAT TIME 
AND TO

[Captioner] 20:48:09
 PREVENT SUCH AN INCIDENT 
OCCURRING AND ALSO MAKING SURE 
THAT

[Captioner] 20:48:12
 WAS AN ISOLATED INCIDENT SO 
I WOULD SUPPORT THE EFFORTS

[Captioner] 20:48:15
 TO 
LET THERE BE LIGHT AND CLARITY 
ON WHAT HAPPENED AND HOW WE

[Captioner] 20:48:18
 CAN 
PREVENT THAT GOING FORWARD AS 
FAR AS THE ACTIONS

[Captioner] 20:48:20
 OF THE CITY 
MANAGER.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:48:24
>> David Persselin:   JUST TO BE 
CLEAR.
THE OUTSIDE AUDITOR THAT

[Captioner] 20:48:28
 WE'VE 
ENGAGED TO LOOK AT OUR PURCHASE

[Captioner] 20:48:31
 
CARD PROGRAM WOULDN'T BE THE

[Captioner] 20:48:35
 
APPROPRIATE TYPE OF

[Captioner] 20:48:38
 CONSULTANT 
OR INVESTIGATOR TO LOOK AT WHAT

[Captioner] 20:48:42
 
PERHAPS WAS A CRIMINAL ACTION.
SO I'M

[Captioner] 20:48:45
 GOING TO DEFER

[Captioner] 20:48:48
 TO THE 
CITY MANAGER OR THE CITY 
ATTORNEY

[Captioner] 20:48:51
 ON, YOU KNOW, ANYTHING 
RELATED TO INVESTIGATION

[Captioner] 20:48:55
 RELATED 
TO FORMER CITY MANAGER.


[Captioner] 20:49:03
>> THANK YOU, I'LL TAKE THAT 
QUESTION.
AS THE COUNCIL IS AWARE

[Captioner] 20:49:06
 AND AS 
MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC ARE LIKELY 
AWARE

[Captioner] 20:49:10
, THE MATTER RELATED TO 
FORMER

[Captioner] 20:49:14
 CITY MANAGER MARK DANAJ 
IS

[Captioner] 20:49:17
 CURRENTLY WITH THE

[Captioner] 20:49:20
 DISTRICT 
ATTORNEY'S, CONSIDERED A 
CRIMINAL MATTER

[Captioner] 20:49:23
, AND THAT'S 
WHERE WE ARE STATUS WISE, THERE 
IS NO ACTION

[Captioner] 20:49:26
 FOR THE CITY TO 
TAKE.
I UNDERSTAND THAT HEARING

[Captioner] 20:49:29
 IN 
THAT MATTER WILL TAKE PLACE 
SOMETIME IN DECEMBER OF THIS

[Captioner] 20:49:33
 
YEAR AND THAT IS THE LATEST 
INFORMATION THAT THE CITY HAS AT 


[Captioner] 20:49:36
THIS POINT.


[Captioner] 20:49:41
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS

[Captioner] 20:49:42
 LEFT FOR 
YOU?
>> Councilmember Salwan:   


[Captioner] 20:49:46
THAT'S IT.
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.
NEXT IS COUNCILMEMBER KENG.


[Captioner] 20:49:49
THANK YOU.
I SEE TWO.


[Captioner] 20:49:54
>> Councilmember Keng:   THANK 
YOU MADAM MAYOR AND THANK YOU 
AGAIN

[Captioner] 20:49:57
 DIRECTOR PERSSELIN FOR 
YOUR DETAILED PRESENTATION.
SO IN

[Captioner] 20:50:00
 FREMONT IT IS A PRIORITY 
FOR THE COUNCIL TEAM AND STAFF 
THAT

[Captioner] 20:50:03
 WE ARE FISCALLY 
RESPONSIBLE,

[Captioner] 20:50:07
 AND THAT WE ARE 
FISCALLY CONSERVATIVE, SO

[Captioner] 20:50:10
 IT'S 
GREAT TO SEE THAT WE ARE SEEING 
THE

[Captioner] 20:50:14
 HIGHER TAX, SALES TAX 
REVENUE COMING OUT OF

[Captioner] 20:50:17
 THE 
PANDEMIC.
HOWEVER WE DO NEED TO FRIAR FOR

[Captioner] 20:50:20
 
THE INCOMING YEARS

[Captioner] 20:50:23
 OF 
UNCERTAINTY INCLUDING INFLATION

[Captioner] 20:50:27
, 
RATE INCREASE, POTENTIAL

[Captioner] 20:50:30
 
RECESSION.
SO I WOULD STRONGLY SUPPORT TO 


[Captioner] 20:50:34
INCREASE THE BUDGET

[Captioner] 20:50:37
 UNCERTAINTY 
RESERVE.
THE PROPOSED ONE AND ALSO

[Captioner] 20:50:41
 TO 
SUPPORT THE INCREASE OF CIP.


[Captioner] 20:50:47
AND ALSO THE TIMING, AS EARLIER

[Captioner] 20:50:52
 
CITY ATTORNEY ALVARADO, HAD

[Captioner] 20:50:56
 
MENTIONED THAT THE FORMER CITY 
MANAGER'S

[Captioner] 20:50:59
 MISHANDLING OF FUNDS 
IS IN THE HANDS OF THE

[Captioner] 20:51:02
 D.A. AND 
ONCE WE HAVE MORE INFORMATION 
COMING OUT THERE

[Captioner] 20:51:06
 THAT IF WE CAN 
MAKE IT THE CITY THE

[Captioner] 20:51:08
 CONFINED OF 
SHARE THAT INFORMATION SO IT'S 
CLEAR WHAT HAPPENED.


[Captioner] 20:51:11
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:51:20
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.
NEXT ON OUR COUNCIL IS 
COUNCILMEMBER COX.


[Captioner] 20:51:26
>> Councilmember Cox:   THANK 
YOU VERY MUCH.


[Captioner] 20:51:36
MADAM MAYOR, AND THANK YOU SO 
MUCH, TO

[Captioner] 20:51:39
 MR. PERSSELIN OF HIS

[Captioner] 20:51:43
 
VERY INFORMATIVE REPORT THAT 
DOES RIGHT NOW

[Captioner] 20:51:46
 HAVE SOME GOOD 
NEWS.
AND I

[Captioner] 20:51:49
 DID WANT TO ASK A COUPLE 
OF QUESTIONS

[Captioner] 20:51:53
.
IN TERMS OF THE BUDGET 
UNCERTAINTY

[Captioner] 20:51:57
 RESERVE THAT YOU'RE 
PROPOSING,

[Captioner] 20:52:00
 $2.5 MILLION, YOU 
KNOW, AS WE LOOK AT

[Captioner] 20:52:03
 JUST BASIC 
LIVING THAT HAS IMPACTED ALL OF

[Captioner] 20:52:06
 
US ACROSS THE ENTIRE COUNTRY, 
BUT WHEN YOU LOOK

[Captioner] 20:52:10
 AT GAS AND HOW 
EXPENSIVE THE GAS IS,

[Captioner] 20:52:13
 AND 
LOOKING AT HOW IMPORTANT THAT IS 
FOR OUR

[Captioner] 20:52:18
 FIRST RESPONDERS TO DO 
WHAT THEY NEED TO DO, IS

[Captioner] 20:52:22
 THERE A 
DOUBLE CHECK IN TERMS OF THE 
NUMBER FOR

[Captioner] 20:52:25
 FUEL COST, BECAUSE

[Captioner] 20:52:29
 AS 
RECEDING

[Captioner] 20:52:32
 ATREND, SOME OF IT HAS 
GONE UP 60% IN ONE

[Captioner] 20:52:35
 YEAR.
I WANT TO MAKE SURE.
I KNOW WE HAVE

[Captioner] 20:52:38
 ELECTRIC 
TRIRVETION

[Captioner] 20:52:42
 ELECTRIFICATION 
GOING ON WITH

[Captioner] 20:52:45
 SOME OF OUR 
VEHICLES BUT BEING SETTLE UP

[Captioner] 20:52:48
 IN 
THE ELECTRICAL BUDGET MODE, 
ELECTRICAL VEHICLE MODE.


[Captioner] 20:52:51
SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT 
WE ARE PAYING ATTENTION TO

[Captioner] 20:52:54
 THIS 
AND ESPECIALLY WITH A LOT

[Captioner] 20:52:58
 OF THE 
COMMODITY FRIESING THAT'S 
HAPPENING WITH FUEL BUT

[Captioner] 20:53:01
 ALSO 
JUST DOUBLE CHECKING IN TERMS OF 
A LOT OF OUR

[Captioner] 20:53:04
 CONTRACTS.
BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME

[Captioner] 20:53:08
 CONTRACTS 
THAT DO HAVE PROVISIONS OF PRICE 
ADJUSTMENT

[Captioner] 20:53:11
.
AND I KNOW THAT

[Captioner] 20:53:15
 WE'RE DOING OUR 
BEST TO TRY TO MAINTAIN THE 
COST.


[Captioner] 20:53:18
BUT THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT 
ARE BEING PASSED ON WHETHER

[Captioner] 20:53:21
 IT'S 
FROM THE TRUCKING INDUSTRY, 
WHETHER IT'S

[Captioner] 20:53:25
 FROM THE INDUSTRY 
SURCHARGES FROM THE STATE

[Captioner] 20:53:28
 OF 
CALIFORNIA COMMISSION ON ENERGY 
USAGE.


[Captioner] 20:53:31
THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS 
HAPPENING

[Captioner] 20:53:34
 AT THE SAME TIME THAT 
ARE ROLLING OUT BUDGETS

[Captioner] 20:53:37
 THAT

[Captioner] 20:53:42
 
WHAT YOU HAVE IN RETHINKING IF 
THERE'S

[Captioner] 20:53:45
 ANY ADVICE OR ANYTHING 
ELSE THAT YOU COULD

[Captioner] 20:53:49
 REASSURE 
NIGHT AS THIS BUDGET IS BEFORE 
US AND

[Captioner] 20:53:52
 YOU'RE DOING WHAT WE HAD 
ALL TALKED ABOUT A FEW MONTHS

[Captioner] 20:53:55
 
AGO BACK IN JULY OF DELIVERING A 
BALANCED BUDGET

[Captioner] 20:53:58
 BUT ALSO 
DELIVERING

[Captioner] 20:54:01
 WHAT IS HAPPENING AND 
WHERE THERE'S THE PROS

[Captioner] 20:54:05
 AND CONS 
IN THIS BUDGET.
BUT JUST TRYING TO SEE IF

[Captioner] 20:54:08
 
THERE'S SOME OTHER AREAS TO MAKE

[Captioner] 20:54:11
 
SURE THAT WE DO HAVE A LITTLE 
BIT MORE IN THE RESERVE FOR 


[Captioner] 20:54:14
THESE ONE-TIME USES THAT COULD 
OCCUR A

[Captioner] 20:54:18
 LITTLE BIT FASTER THAN 
WHAT WE PREDICTED RIGHT NOW.


[Captioner] 20:54:23
>> David Persselin:   YES, ONE 
OF THE THINGS THAT I DID MENTION 
WAS THAT AS

[Captioner] 20:54:26
 PART OF THE MID YEAR 
BUDGET REPORT IN MARCH,

[Captioner] 20:54:29
 WHICH IS 
BASED ON APPROXIMATELY SIX 
MONTHS

[Captioner] 20:54:33
 OF REVENUE EXPENDITURE 
DATA, WE MAY BE

[Captioner] 20:54:36
 MAKING BUDGET 
ADJUSTMENT

[Captioner] 20:54:39
 RECOMMENDATIONS TO 
THE CITY COUNCIL.
SO IF,

[Captioner] 20:54:42
 AT THE MIDWAY POINT, WE 
SEE THAT WE ARE

[Captioner] 20:54:45
 IN FACT 
SIGNIFICANTLY EXCEEDING OUR 
BUDGET FOR

[Captioner] 20:54:48
 FUEL, FOR EXAMPLE, WE 
MIGHT

[Captioner] 20:54:52
 ACTUALLY RECOMMEND TO THE 
CITY COUNCIL THAT WE INCREASE 
APPROPRIATIONS FOR

[Captioner] 20:54:55
 THAT PURPOSE.
SO THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE

[Captioner] 20:54:58
 WOULD 
BE DOING AS PART OF THE MID YEAR 
BUDGET REPORT

[Captioner] 20:55:02
.
>> Councilmember Cox:   OKAY SO 
IT'S BASICALLY COULD YOU COME 


[Captioner] 20:55:05
BACK, I MEAN TODAY IS TODAY, OF 
WHAT THE FACTS ARE, AND

[Captioner] 20:55:08
 THEN IF 
THERE'S SOME AREAS THAT WE NEED

[Captioner] 20:55:11
 
TO ADDRESS YOU WOULD BRING IT 
FORTH IN THAT

[Captioner] 20:55:14
 SIX-MONTH REVIEW 
PERIOD TO HIGHLIGHT WHAT THINGS 
NEED

[Captioner] 20:55:18
 TO BE ADJUSTED AT THAT 
TIME.
CORRECT?

[Captioner] 20:55:20

>> David Persselin:   THAT'S 
EXACTLY RIGHT.


[Captioner] 20:55:23
>> Councilmember Cox:   OKAY.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.


[Captioner] 20:55:26
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.
I

[Captioner] 20:55:30
 SEE COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN.

[Captioner] 20:55:32

>> Councilmember Kassan:   YEAH, 
I JUST WANT TO UNDERSTAND A 


[Captioner] 20:55:35
LITTLE BIT BETTER THE DIVISION 
OF RESPONSIBILITIES

[Captioner] 20:55:38
 TO 
UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENED WITH 
THE FORMER CITY MANAGER

[Captioner] 20:55:41
.
I UNDERSTAND THAT THE CASE IS

[Captioner] 20:55:44
 
BEING PROSECUTED, SO

[Captioner] 20:55:48
 OBVIOUSLY 
SOME EVIDENCE WOULD NEED TO BE 
GATHERED BY

[Captioner] 20:55:51
 THE D.A.
BUT IF WE'RE

[Captioner] 20:55:55
 HAVING AN AUDIT IT 
SEEMS LIKE THE AUDIT

[Captioner] 20:55:58
 MIGHT COVER 
THAT AS WELL.
AND I'M JUST

[Captioner] 20:56:01
 WONDERING, YOU 
KNOW, HAS THE

[Captioner] 20:56:04
 D.A. HIRED LIKE A 
FREFN SICK

[Captioner] 20:56:07
 
FORENSIC ACCOUNTANT TO DETERMINE

[Captioner] 20:56:10
 
WHAT HAPPENED?
I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE 


[Captioner] 20:56:13
CAN ULTIMATELY GET TO A POINT 
WHERE WE CAN SHARE DETAILS WITH 
THE

[Captioner] 20:56:16
 PUBLIC ON WHAT EXACTLY DID  
HAPPEN.


[Captioner] 20:56:23
>> THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION, 
I'LL TAKE A PORTION.
CAN YOU HEAR

[Captioner] 20:56:26
 ME NOW?

[Captioner] 20:56:29

>> ONE MORE TIME.
>> TRY AGAIN.


[Captioner] 20:56:32
BETTER?
THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S CASE IS

[Captioner] 20:56:35
 
PENDING AND REALLY THE CITY IS 
JUST MONITORING

[Captioner] 20:56:38
 UNTIL THAT 
MATTER IS RESOLVED.
AND WE'RE

[Captioner] 20:56:42
 NOT PRIVY TO WHAT 
INVESTIGATIONS

[Captioner] 20:56:45
 THE D.A.'S OFFICE 
MAY CONDUCT ON A

[Captioner] 20:56:48
 CRIMINAL MATTER 
AND THEREFORE JUST WAITING TO 
GET UPDATES AS THE

[Captioner] 20:56:50
 CASE 
PROCEEDS.
AT THIS POINT THE ONLY 


[Captioner] 20:56:54
INFORMATION WE DO HAVE IS THE 
NEXT MEETING WILL TAKE PLACE

[Captioner] 20:56:57
 IN 
DECEMBER AND AT THAT POINT WE 
MAY HAVE SOMETHING

[Captioner] 20:57:00
 ADDITIONAL TO 
REPORT.
THE AUDIT IS A COMPLETELY

[Captioner] 20:57:03
 
SEPARATE REPORT THAT HAS 
SEPARATE OBJECTIVES

[Captioner] 20:57:06
.
AND OF COURSE,

[Captioner] 20:57:09
 DIRECTOR 
PERSSELIN COULD SPEAK TO THE 
SPECIFICS OF THE

[Captioner] 20:57:12
 FOCUS BY THE 
CONSULTANT BUT THEY'RE CERTAINLY 
NOT

[Captioner] 20:57:16
 GOING TO BE OVERLAP AND 
WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO

[Captioner] 20:57:19
 
OBVIOUSLY ENTERTAIN THE SAME 
LEVEL OF FACT REVIEW

[Captioner] 20:57:23
 THAT THE 
D.A.'S OFFICE HAS ON

[Captioner] 20:57:26
 THE 
INVESTIGATORY SIDE

[Captioner] 20:57:29
.
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU, 
COUNCILMEMBER COX.


[Captioner] 20:57:36
>> Councilmember Cox:   THANK 
YOU VERY MUCH, MADAM MAYOR.
I THINK WHAT WE'RE TRYING

[Captioner] 20:57:39
 TO SAY 
HERE, I THINK FROM

[Captioner] 20:57:42
 OUR CITY 
ATTORNEY'S PERSPECTIVE, THERE'S 
TWO THINGS GOING ON

[Captioner] 20:57:45
 THAT YOUR 
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT

[Captioner] 20:57:49
 WHEN 
SOMETHING'S INVESTIGATION THAT'S 
ONE THING.


[Captioner] 20:57:52
THEN THERE'S A SEPARATE AUDITOR 
THAT IS REVIEWING OUR

[Captioner] 20:57:55
 PURCHASE 
CARD PROGRAM, RIGHT?
AND ONCE THEY

[Captioner] 20:57:59
 IDENTIFY, BECAUSE 
I USED TO RUN ONE OF THOSE

[Captioner] 20:58:03
 IN 
THE PAST LIFE BUT USUALLY WHAT 
TENDS TO HAPPEN IS THAT

[Captioner] 20:58:06
 AFTER 
YOU HAVE AN AUDIT AND YOU HAVE 
THE GAPS IN THE

[Captioner] 20:58:09
 FINDINGS AND 
THEN YOU PUT TOGETHER 
PROCEDURES, TO BE

[Captioner] 20:58:12
 ABLE TO MAKE 
THOSE THINGS HAPPEN, IS

[Captioner] 20:58:15
 THAT 
SOMETHING FROM THE AUDITOR'S

[Captioner] 20:58:19
 
WORK THAT IT WOULD BE SOMETHING 
TO BE SHARED

[Captioner] 20:58:23
 WITH CITY COUNCIL 
JUST IN THE PRACTICE, JUST IN 
THE PURCHASE

[Captioner] 20:58:26
 CARD PROGRAM?
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW IF SOME OF

[Captioner] 20:58:29
 
OUR -- MY OTHER CITY COUNCIL 
MEMBERS

[Captioner] 20:58:33
 HAVE PURCHASE CARDS 
ISSUED TO THEM

[Captioner] 20:58:36
 FROM THE CITY OF 
FREMONT BUT JUST AS SOME OF US

[Captioner] 20:58:40
 
AS EVEN AS YOU BECOME NEW 
MEMBERS AND THEN AS THINGS

[Captioner] 20:58:43
 ARE 
UPDATED BASED ON REGULATIONS AND 
REPORTING

[Captioner] 20:58:47
 WITH THE GOVERNMENT 
ENTITIES THAT THINGS DO CHANGE 
AND THEY HAVE SOME SORT

[Captioner] 20:58:50
 OF  
RETRAINING FOR THE CARD PROGRAM.
IF

[Captioner] 20:58:53
 THERE'S ANY LIKE YOU COULD 
SHARE AND JUST GENERAL 
INFORMATION

[Captioner] 20:58:56
 IN TERMS OF

[Captioner] 20:59:00
 -- I 
UNDERSTAND THE CONCERN WITH 
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN

[Captioner] 20:59:03
 AS WELL AS 
IT'S, YOU KNOW, BEEN SUPPORTED 
BY MY OTHER

[Captioner] 20:59:07
 TWO CITY COUNCIL 
MEMBERS.
BUT IS THERE SOMETHING THAT

[Captioner] 20:59:10
 CAN 
BE SHARED IN TERMS OF A NEW 
PROGRAM,

[Captioner] 20:59:13
 A NEW POLICY, A NEW

[Captioner] 20:59:16
 
THING, A NEW PART OF HOW WE'LL

[Captioner] 20:59:20
 
BE, BASED ON THE AUDIT RESULTS, 
AND HOW THOSE THINGS

[Captioner] 20:59:23
 WOULD LEAD 
TO US HAVING A NEW PURCHASE CARD

[Captioner] 20:59:27
 
PROGRAM AND PROCEDURE, IS THAT 
SOMETHING THAT CAN BE DONE 


[Captioner] 20:59:31
WITHIN THE NEXT SIX MONTHS?
OR IS THAT SOMETHING

[Captioner] 20:59:35
 TOO EARLY 
OR IS IT MORE INFORMATION

[Captioner] 20:59:39
 NEEDED 
TO ADVISE US

[Captioner] 20:59:42
?
>> I BELIEVE DIRECTOR PERSSELIN 
SAID

[Captioner] 20:59:45
 THE INFORMATION WOULD COME 
BACK PRIOR TO THAT TIME.

[Captioner] 20:59:48

I'LL LET HIM ANSWER.
BUT THE INFORMATION FROM THE 


[Captioner] 20:59:52
AUDIT WILL BE PUBLIC AND WOULD 
BE SHARED WITH THE

[Captioner] 20:59:56
 CITY COUNCIL 
TOGETHER WITH I WOULD IMAGINE 
CHANGES

[Captioner] 20:59:59
 TO THE PROCESS.
DIRECTOR PERSSELIN

[Captioner] 21:00:03
 MAY WANT TO 
EXPAND ON WHAT I SAID.
>> David Persselin:  

[Captioner] 21:00:06
THANKS.
AS I

[Captioner] 21:00:10
 NOTED WE SEPARATELY ENGAGED 
THE AUDITOR TO DO

[Captioner] 21:00:13
 AN ASSESSMENT 
OF OUR PURCHASE CARD PROCEDURES 
AND

[Captioner] 21:00:17
 PROGRAM AND WE ARE REVIEWING 
A DRAFT OF THAT NOW.
I WOULD EXPECT

[Captioner] 21:00:20
 THAT THAT WOULD 
BE AVAILABLE TO THE

[Captioner] 21:00:23
 CITY COUNCIL 
AND THE PUBLIC SOMETIME WITHIN 
THE NEXT MONTH OR

[Captioner] 21:00:26
 TWO.
AND AT THAT TIME, WE CAN

[Captioner] 21:00:29
 TALK 
MORE IF WE WANT TO ABOUT, YOU 
KNOW,

[Captioner] 21:00:32
 WHAT CHANGES WE MIGHT BE 
MAKING TO OUR PROCEDURES.


[Captioner] 21:00:38
>> Councilmember Cox:   THAT 
WOULD BE GREAT.
I THINK THAT WOULD HELP ADDRESS 


[Captioner] 21:00:41
SOME OF THAT.
EVEN THOUGH WE WOULDN'T GET FULL 
DISCLOSURE

[Captioner] 21:00:44
 BUT AT LEAST THAT 
PART AND FRAIGHT

[Captioner] 21:00:47
 OPERATING IT AND 
SUCCESSFULLY

[Captioner] 21:00:50
 GOING FORWARD.
THAT WOULD BE GREATLY.
THANK YOU FOR THE UPDATE

[Captioner] 21:00:53
.
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.
I ALSO WANTED TO CHECK BEFORE

[Captioner] 21:00:57
 WE 
PROCEED, I ALSO WANT TO SEE IF 
THERE ARE ANY SPEAKERS

[Captioner] 21:01:00
 ON THIS 
AGENDA ITEM WHICH I THINK THERE 
ARE

[Captioner] 21:01:03
.
>> The Clerk:   YES, WE 
CURRENTLY HAVE THREE SPEAKERS.


[Captioner] 21:01:06
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.
>> The Clerk:   FIRST SPEAKER IS 
CHRIS

[Captioner] 21:01:09
.
>> Mayor Mei:   WELCOME CHRIS.
>> THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 21:01:14

SO

[Captioner] 21:01:21
 MY COMMENT IS GOING TO LOOK 
VERY STRANGE RIGHT NOW OR

[Captioner] 21:01:24
 SOUND 
A LITTLE STRANGE, DO YOU

[Captioner] 21:01:27
 EVER 
LOOK BACKWARDS

[Captioner] 21:01:30
?
I THINK EVERYONE ON THE CITY 
COUNCIL WANTS TO LOOK BACKWARDS

[Captioner] 21:01:34
.
BUT IF YOU LOOK BACKWARDS TO THE 
FACT THAT

[Captioner] 21:01:38
 IF WE BUILT THAT PARK 
FIVE YEARS EARLIER

[Captioner] 21:01:41
 AND PAID 
MAINTENANCE ON IT THE TAXPAYER 
WOULD HAVE

[Captioner] 21:01:45
 PAID LEST?
WHAT'S GOING UP MORE THAN THE 
COST

[Captioner] 21:01:49
 OF LABOR IS THE COST TO 
CONSTRUCT PLACES.
AND WHEN I

[Captioner] 21:01:53
 JUST LOOK AT THINGS 
IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD,

[Captioner] 21:01:56
 I SEE COSTS 
THAT YOU GUYS PUT DOWN

[Captioner] 21:01:59
 
ORIGINALLY FOR $150,000 AND THEN 
A YEAR LATER

[Captioner] 21:02:02
 YOU HAD TO COME 
BACK FOR $230,000 MORE JUST TO

[Captioner] 21:02:05
 
COMPLETE THE PROJECT.
SO BY SAVING THAT

[Captioner] 21:02:09
 $150,000, AT A 
VERY

[Captioner] 21:02:12
 FEW PERCENTAGE RATES YOU 
LOS THE TAXPAYERS

[Captioner] 21:02:15
 A BUNCH MUCH 
MONEY AND I HEAR THAT TIME AND 
TIME AGAIN IN THE

[Captioner] 21:02:18
 BUDGET.
BUT I'D ALSO LIKE TO SAY THAT 
WHAT

[Captioner] 21:02:22
 I HEAR IN THIS THING IS OH 
WE HAVE MONEY WE SHOULD SAVE IT

[Captioner] 21:02:25
.
AND THAT'S WHERE I THINK YOU 
GUYS SHOULD SORT OF LOOK

[Captioner] 21:02:28
 AT THE 
LONG TERM COST TO BUILD STUFF 
AND WHETHER YOU SHOULD BUILD IT

[Captioner] 21:02:31
 
NOW OR SAVE THE MONEY.
I UNDERSTAND THAT

[Captioner] 21:02:34
 A CITY CAN'T 
GO ON TO THE RED, I UNDERSTAND

[Captioner] 21:02:37
 
THAT.
BUT I THINK THE

[Captioner] 21:02:40
 COSTS, YOU'RE 
SAVING MONEY TODAY AND

[Captioner] 21:02:44
 -- BUT 
THE TAXPAYER IS PAYING MUCH MORE 
IN THE LONG

[Captioner] 21:02:47
 RUN.

[Captioner] 21:02:52

SO YOU HAVE A SURPLUS

[Captioner] 21:02:55
.
YOU WANT TO SAY YOU WANT TO USE 
IT FOR A RAINY DAY

[Captioner] 21:02:59
.
TELL THE HOMELESS THAT TODAY IS 
NOT A RAINY

[Captioner] 21:03:02
 DAY.
YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY, YOU 
GUYS

[Captioner] 21:03:05
 COULD BUILD A GREAT SAFE 
PARKING STRUCTURE

[Captioner] 21:03:09
 IN THE AUTO 
MALL PARKWAY.
YOU OWN THE LAND,

[Captioner] 21:03:12
 YOU'VE ALREADY 
DONE IMPROVEMENTS.
IT WOULD COST YOU LESS THAN

[Captioner] 21:03:15
 YOUR 
ACTUAL SURPLUS IS.


[Captioner] 21:03:18
ADDITIONALLY I WANT TO COMMENT 
ON THINGS I HEARD DURING THE

[Captioner] 21:03:21
 
TIME PERIOD.
I HEARD OH NO THE PUBLIC

[Captioner] 21:03:24
 REPORT 
WON'T CONTAIN THAT, AND

[Captioner] 21:03:28
 THAT 
UPSETS ME BECAUSE THERE

[Captioner] 21:03:31
 
SHOULDN'T BE ONE REPORT, THERE 
SHOULD BE DATA AND THEN THE 


[Captioner] 21:03:34
REPORT AND IF THE PUBLIC WANTS 
TO ASK FOR THE DATA, THEY CAN 
UNDER

[Captioner] 21:03:38
 THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION 
ACT UNLESS IT FALLS UNDER A

[Captioner] 21:03:41
 VERY 
SMALL SET OF THINGS THEY CAN'T 
DO.


[Captioner] 21:03:44
ADDITIONALLY YOU GUYS SAID MAYBE 
YOU TWICE

[Captioner] 21:03:47
 SHOULD BUILD SPEND THE 
MONEY TO BUILD

[Captioner] 21:03:50
 THE CENTERVILLE 
COMMUNITY CENTER, REBUILD IT, 
THAT

[Captioner] 21:03:53
 WOULD BE NICE EXCEPT IT 
CURRENTLY

[Captioner] 21:03:57
 OPERATES AFTER 10 P.M. 
UNDER THE

[Captioner] 21:04:00
 CITY USE WHICH IS

[Captioner] 21:04:03
 
ASSEMBLY CODE 0.

[Captioner] 21:04:06
15.19.
I COULD

[Captioner] 21:04:09
 GO ON BECAUSE OF HOW THE

[Captioner] 21:04:13
 
AUTO R FLUCTUATE.
THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 21:04:16

>> The Clerk:   NEXT SPEAKER IS 
KELLY.


[Captioner] 21:04:19
>> THANK YOU.
SO WE JUST HEARD THAT MARCH IS 
GOING TO BE THE

[Captioner] 21:04:22
 MIDWAY POINT BUT 
I JUST CHECKED MY

[Captioner] 21:04:25
 CALENDAR, 
DECEMBER 31st IS ACTUALLY THE 
HALFWAY POINT

[Captioner] 21:04:27
 IN THE FISCAL 
YEAR.
AND IT WOULD BE NEARLY THREE 


[Captioner] 21:04:31
QUARTERS COMPLETE IN MARCH.
SO THAT IDEA OF

[Captioner] 21:04:35
 THAT DESCRIPTOR 
OF MIDWAY NEVER APPLIES

[Captioner] 21:04:38
 TO 
MARCH.
IT MIGHT APPLY TO DECEMBER NOT

[Captioner] 21:04:41
 
MARCH.
SO TODAY WE'RE LOOKING 


[Captioner] 21:04:45
BACKWARDS, HISTORICAL REPORTS, 
NOT LOOKING FORWARD.
THE FREMONT

[Captioner] 21:04:48
 AND WE'RE NOT 
LOOKING AT OTHER CITIES.
FREMONT'S MAINTAIN

[Captioner] 21:04:51
ING A GENERAL 
FUND RESERVE

[Captioner] 21:04:54
 AT THE BEAR MINIMUM 
OF 17% OF OPERATING

[Captioner] 21:04:59
 EXPENSES

[Captioner] 21:05:03
, 
PLEASANTON KEEPS ITS OPERATING 
RESERVE

[Captioner] 21:05:08
 EVER 15% OF

[Captioner] 21:05:11
 OPERATING 
RESERVES.
ALL OR THE THE BEST, FREMONT

[Captioner] 21:05:15
 
MANAGERS OBVIOUSLY BELIEVE THAT 
THIS IS THE BEST OF ALL POSSIBLE

[Captioner] 21:05:18
 
WORLDS.
BUT, YOU KNOW, IF YOU LOOK AT 


[Captioner] 21:05:21
OTHER CITIES LIKE SURVEY OF THE 
NATIONAL LEAGUE OF CITIES THAT 
JUST

[Captioner] 21:05:24
 CAME OUT A FEW DAYS AGO, 
THEY SURVEY

[Captioner] 21:05:27
ED U.S. CITY FINANCE

[Captioner] 21:05:31
 
OFFICERS AND THEY'RE COMING OUT 
LESS OPTIMISTIC

[Captioner] 21:05:34
, THEY LOOKED AT 
FOUR CITIES AND SAW WORSENING 
FINANCES

[Captioner] 21:05:38
 IN 2023 WITH A DROP IN 
REVENUE AS THE

[Captioner] 21:05:41
 ECONOMY SLOWS.
LAST YEAR THEY WERE MUCH MORE

[Captioner] 21:05:44
 
OPT MIRVEG, 90% OMENTD 
MISCELLANEOUS BECAUSE THE

[Captioner] 21:05:47
 CITIES 
WERE RECEIVING FUNDS FOR 
PANDEMIC RELIEF.


[Captioner] 21:05:50
SOME OF THE CITIES EVEN EXPECT 
PROPERTY TAXES TO SLOW

[Captioner] 21:05:54
 DOWN OR 
DECLINE SINCE THE

[Captioner] 21:05:57
 FEDERAL 
RESERVE IS AGGRESSIVELY HIKING 
INTEREST

[Captioner] 21:06:00
 RATES, REMEMBER WE'RE 
NOT LOOKING FORWARD HERE WE'RE 
LOOK

[Captioner] 21:06:04
ING BACKWARDS TODAY.
AND NOW ACCORDING TO THE

[Captioner] 21:06:07
 CHIEF 
EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF THE 
NATIONAL LEAGUE OF CITIES, 


[Captioner] 21:06:10
QUOTE, AMERICA'S CITIES ARE 
WRAISING FOR STAGF

[Captioner] 21:06:13
LATION AND 
POSSIBLE ECONOMIC

[Captioner] 21:06:16
 DOWNTURN END 
QUOTE,

[Captioner] 21:06:19
 SOME BUDGETING 
CONSERVATIVELY.

[Captioner] 21:06:24

THE

[Captioner] 21:06:27
 DISCIPLES OF

[Captioner] 21:06:31
 DR. PENGLOVE, 
WE THINK THAT'S ENOUGH OF A

[Captioner] 21:06:34
 
CUSHION TO CUSHION US FOR

[Captioner] 21:06:37
 
ANYTHING, WE'RE VERY BUSY 
LOOKING

[Captioner] 21:06:41
 IN THE REARVIEW MIRROR 
SO WE CAN'T REALLY SEE ANY

[Captioner] 21:06:44
 
RECESSION AHEAD OF US BECAUSE 
WE'RE LOOKING

[Captioner] 21:06:47
 AT THE REARVIEW 
MIRROR AT THE REVENUE STREAM.

[Captioner] 21:06:51

FREMONT HAS NO PLANS TO ISSUE 
ANY FIXED RATE BONDS SO

[Captioner] 21:06:54
 OF 
COURSE WE ARE NOT GOING TO BE 
AFFECTED BY HIGHER INTEREST 


[Captioner] 21:06:57
RATES.
WE'RE ONLY LOOKING BACKWARDS AT 
THE BONDS WE

[Captioner] 21:07:00
 ALREADY ISSUED 
REMEMBER.
SO WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO

[Captioner] 21:07:03
 BE -- TO LIVING HERE.
LIVING HERE WE'RE GOING TO 
CONTINUE

[Captioner] 21:07:06
 LIVING IN THE BEST OF 
ALL POSSIBLE WORLDS AS

[Captioner] 21:07:11
 PROFESSOR 
PENGLOSS TOLD US YOU KNOW,

[Captioner] 21:07:15
 JUST 
KEEP A SMILING FACE, HAPPY FACE 
AND DON'T

[Captioner] 21:07:18
 ISSUE ANY NEW BONDS 
BECAUSE THE INTEREST RATES MIGHT 
GO

[Captioner] 21:07:21
 UP.
THANK YOU.
>> The Clerk:  

[Captioner] 21:07:24
 NEXT SPEAKER IS 
VENETA

[Captioner] 21:07:27
 VERMA.
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

[Captioner] 21:07:30

SO I'M REALLY GLAD THAT WE HAVE 
A POSITIVE

[Captioner] 21:07:34
 BUDGET, AND WE HAVE 
GOOD INFLOW

[Captioner] 21:07:37
 AND I'M HAPPY THAT 
FREMONT IS DOING GOOD.


[Captioner] 21:07:41
BUT AS CHRIS MENTIONED, NOT 
EVERYBODY IS DOING WELL

[Captioner] 21:07:44
.
OUR HOMELESS POPULATION IS NOT 
DOING WELL.

[Captioner] 21:07:49

AND AS SOME OF YOU KNOW,

[Captioner] 21:07:52
 OUR 
WALKWAYS, OUR PATHWAYS

[Captioner] 21:07:55
 OUR LOCAL 
STREETS ARE NOT ADA COMPLIANT.

[Captioner] 21:07:58

THAT IS FEDERAL VIOLATION -- 
THAT IS

[Captioner] 21:08:01
 VIOLATION OF FEDERAL 
LAW.
IF

[Captioner] 21:08:04
 OUR -- THE PEOPLE WHO ARE 
DISABLED ARE NOT ABLE TO USE

[Captioner] 21:08:07
 THE 
WALKWAY, THE PATHWAY

[Captioner] 21:08:11
 NEXT TO THE 
PUBLIC STREET THAT IS CERTAINLY

[Captioner] 21:08:14
 
SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD BE 
WORKING ON,

[Captioner] 21:08:17
 THINK ABOUT IT.
WHAT ARE WE -- WHAT ARE WE

[Captioner] 21:08:20
 
SAYING?
WE ARE SAYING WE VALUE OUR BIKE 


[Captioner] 21:08:23
RIDERS, WE VALUE -- MAYBE WE 
VALUE

[Captioner] 21:08:26
 OUR CAR RIDERS, WE DON'T 
CARE ABOUT OUR ADA PEOPLE.

[Captioner] 21:08:29

WE DON'T CARE ABOUT DISABLED 
PEOPLE.


[Captioner] 21:08:32
THEY WANT TO TAKE A STROLL, LET 
THEM FIGURE OUT

[Captioner] 21:08:36
 HOW TO DO IT.
BECAUSE OUR LOCAL

[Captioner] 21:08:39
 CITY STREETS 
ARE CERTAINLY, CERTAINLY,

[Captioner] 21:08:42
 NOT 
ADA COMPLIANCE.
ON MY STREET WE

[Captioner] 21:08:45
 HAVE SIX, FIVE 
OR SIX TREES WHICH

[Captioner] 21:08:48
 HAVE UPROOTED 
THE SIDEWALK

[Captioner] 21:08:52
, BY ABOUT A 7

[Captioner] 21:08:55
 FOOT OR 
MORE.
I CANNOT EVEN IMAGINE ANYBODY

[Captioner] 21:08:58
 
WHO IS ON WHEELCHAIR TO GO ON 
THEM.


[Captioner] 21:09:03
SO THERE ARE -- OUR CITY IS IN 
DIRE NEED

[Captioner] 21:09:06
 OF LOTS OF STUFF.
I HOPE YOU GUYS

[Captioner] 21:09:10
 LOOK AT THOSE 
THINGS TOO.
WE HAVE PUSHED A LOT

[Captioner] 21:09:13
 OF THINGS 
TO OH NOT, WE DON'T HAVE BUDGET,

[Captioner] 21:09:16
 
WE DON'T HAVE MONEY.
WE WILL NOT TAKE CARE OF

[Captioner] 21:09:19
 OUR 
CITY TREES, WE WILL NOT TAKE 
CARE OF OUR CITY

[Captioner] 21:09:22
 SIDEWALKS.
WE WILL NOT TAKE CARE OF THIS, 
THIS IS ALL, WE HAVE

[Captioner] 21:09:26
 PUSHED IT 
TO THE HOMEOWNERS BUT THAT IS 
NOT FAIR.

[Captioner] 21:09:29

THEN SOMEBODY BUYS A HOUSE IN 
FREMONT THEY'RE

[Captioner] 21:09:32
 NOT AWARE THAT 
THE CITY IS NOT DEALING WITH 
THAT.


[Captioner] 21:09:35
AND MORE THAN ANYTHING AS I SAID 
WE NEED TO BE ADA COMPLIANT

[Captioner] 21:09:39
.
I AM JUST HOPING THAT NOBODY 
GETS AN

[Captioner] 21:09:42
 IDEA THAT CITY CAN BE 
SUED FOR NOT

[Captioner] 21:09:45
 BEING FEDERALLY 
COMPLIANT WITH ADA.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 21:09:51
>> The Clerk:   THE NEXT SPEAKER 
IS

[Captioner] 21:09:56
 BLAIR BEEKMAN.

[Captioner] 21:09:59

>> HI BLAIR BEEKMAN HERE, THANKS 
A LOT FOR THIS ITEM

[Captioner] 21:10:03
.
(INAUDIBLE) HAVE TO CONSIDER

[Captioner] 21:10:07
 
WHAT MOVING FORWARD MEANS FOR 
OURSELVES

[Captioner] 21:10:10
.
FIRST OF ALL, VERY MUCH OF

[Captioner] 21:10:13
 A 
THANK YOU TO COUNCILPERSON

[Captioner] 21:10:16
 COME 
WHO I THINK VERY NICELY TRIED TO 
DESCRIBE KIND OF

[Captioner] 21:10:20
 THE FACTORS 
THAT CONTRIBUTED STARTING IN 20

[Captioner] 21:10:23

2021, TO THE CURRENT INFLATION 
ISSUES WE ARE NOW

[Captioner] 21:10:26
 HAVING.
WHAT SHE DIDN'T ADD

[Captioner] 21:10:29
 TO THE LIST 
THAT STARTED THE LIST I FELT 
BASICALLY,

[Captioner] 21:10:33
 WAS A PRETTY 
SIGNIFICANT RAISE IN

[Captioner] 21:10:36
 POLICE 
UNION WAGES

[Captioner] 21:10:40
 BACK IN EARLY SPRING 
OF 2021.


[Captioner] 21:10:43
AND A CONTINUING

[Captioner] 21:10:48
 (INAUDIBLE) 
THAT

[Captioner] 21:10:51
 (INAUDIBLE) BUT

[Captioner] 21:10:55
 LET'S GO 
AROUND LET IT HAPPEN.
ALL RIGHT WITH THAT

[Captioner] 21:10:59
 SAID,

[Captioner] 21:11:02
 THAT 
WE SEEM TO BE AT A TIME IN 
SILICON VALLEY

[Captioner] 21:11:06
 OF CONSOLIDATING 
AND REORGANIZING OURSELVES AND

[Captioner] 21:11:09
 
PEOPLE ARE SAYING IT IS THE END 
OF SILICON VALLEY.

[Captioner] 21:11:12

BUT (INAUDIBLE)

[Captioner] 21:11:21

[ DISTORTED SPEECH.]
>> The Clerk: 

[Captioner] 21:11:24
  MR. BEAKMAN --

[Captioner] 21:11:27

>> YES AND RESPONSIBILITY WITH 
THOSE PRACTICES MEAN THIS HAS A 


[Captioner] 21:11:30
PURPOSE WHAT I'M SPEAKING ABOUT.
AND THE CONCEPTS OF 
RESPONSIBILITY HAS

[Captioner] 21:11:34
 A PURPOSE IN 
HOW WE PRACTICE OUR LIVES

[Captioner] 21:11:37
 AND 
COMMUNITY AND IT IS WITH THAT IN

[Captioner] 21:11:40
 
MIND THAT THAT'S HOW WE CAN 
CONSIDER WHAT 20

[Captioner] 21:11:44
23 WILL BE 
ABOUT, AND IT

[Captioner] 21:11:48
 BUILDS -- IT 
BUILDS OUR BETTER FUTURE TO

[Captioner] 21:11:51
 
CONSIDER OUR HUMAN RIGHTS 
VALUES, CIVIL RIGHTS AND

[Captioner] 21:11:54
 
CIVILITY PROTECTION VALUES AND 
THAT'S HOW WE BUILD SUSTAIN

[Captioner] 21:11:57

SUSTAINABILITY AND COMMUNITY.
WE HAVE VERY TOUGH ISSUES OF THE 


[Captioner] 21:12:00
ECONOMY COMING UP AND IT'S MUDDY 
AND QUESTIONABLE.

[Captioner] 21:12:04

AND WE'S NAVIGATED

[Captioner] 21:12:07
 WE WE'VE

[Captioner] 21:12:10
 ALWAYS NAVIGATED 
AND RECEIVED,

[Captioner] 21:12:13
 BASICALLY AND 2023 
IS AN UN

[Captioner] 21:12:17
COMFORTABLE KIND OF YEAR 
WE CAN SAY WE HAVE BETTER PLANS 
IN STORE AND

[Captioner] 21:12:20
 WE CAN WORK TOWARDS 
THOSE PLANS AND I THINK I'M 
TRYING TO

[Captioner] 21:12:23
 DESCRIBE WAYS TO 
REALLY NAVIGATE 2023.

[Captioner] 21:12:26

AND ALL MY PREVIOUS WORDS IN 
PAST MONTHS

[Captioner] 21:12:30
 ABOUT DO WE HAVE TO 
PREPARE FOR A NATURAL DISASTER 
OR

[Captioner] 21:12:33
 EARTHQUAKE IN 23, TO SIMPLY 
MENTION IT AND

[Captioner] 21:12:36
 TO TRY TO 
MITIGATE IT, IT'S IMPORTANT TO 
TRY TO MITIGATE

[Captioner] 21:12:39
 IT THAT CAN GIVE 
US OPTIONS IN HOW TO OPENLY TALK

[Captioner] 21:12:42
 
ABOUT AND SAFELY TALK ABOUT 2023 
AND PLAN

[Captioner] 21:12:46
 WELL AND WORK TOWARDS A 
COMMUNITY

[Captioner] 21:12:49
 SAFETY PRACTICES, 
HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES 
REIMAGINE THOSE ARE

[Captioner] 21:12:53
 REALLY 
IMPORTANT CONCEPTS WAY MORE 
IMPORTANT

[Captioner] 21:12:56
 THAN LAW ENFORCEMENT 
AND TECHNOLOGY.
LET'S FOCUS ON THOSE THINGS.

[Captioner] 21:12:59

>> The Clerk:   NEXT SPEAKER IS 
KATHERINE.


[Captioner] 21:13:13
>> HI, I'M GOING TO AGREE WITH 
EVERYONE HERE THAT IS TALKING 
ABOUT

[Captioner] 21:13:16
 THE NEED FOR A SURPLUS TO 
BE USED

[Captioner] 21:13:20
 FOR HOMELESS, UNHOUSED,

[Captioner] 21:13:23
 
UNDERHOUSED

[Captioner] 21:13:29
 PEOPLE.
THERE ARE A LOT OF PLACE WREST 
THAT MONEY

[Captioner] 21:13:32
 PLACES

[Captioner] 21:13:36
 WHERE 
THAT MONEY COUGH USED.
AND I

[Captioner] 21:13:39
 COULD BE USED.
AND I

[Captioner] 21:13:42
 THINK DIVIDING THAT MONEY 
IN PLACES WHERE THAT

[Captioner] 21:13:45
 MONEY COULD 
BE USED TO SERVICE PEOPLE WHO 
ARE AT RISK

[Captioner] 21:13:49
 OR HOMELESS WOULD BE 
A GREAT

[Captioner] 21:13:52
 HELP IN SPEEDING THINGS

[Captioner] 21:13:56
 
UP FOR ASSISTANCE FOR PEOPLE WHO 
ARE LIVING ON THE

[Captioner] 21:13:59
 STREETS.

[Captioner] 21:14:05

ONE OF THE SUGGESTIONS I HAVE, 
TOO,

[Captioner] 21:14:09
 IS THAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE 
SOME

[Captioner] 21:14:12
 SORT OF ENTITY OR

[Captioner] 21:14:15
 AGENCY 
THAT WOULD GIVE OVERSIGHT TO

[Captioner] 21:14:18
 
SOME OF THESE LOW INCOME 
COMMUNITIES

[Captioner] 21:14:22
 THAT ARE BEING 
BUILT, BECAUSE I HAD AN

[Captioner] 21:14:25
 
EXPERIENCE A FEW YEARS AGO WITH 
ONE OF THESE

[Captioner] 21:14:28
 THAT I KNOW BROKE 
STATE LAW FOR

[Captioner] 21:14:32
 ONE, AND I SUSPECT 
IS ALSO

[Captioner] 21:14:35
 RUNNING A SCAM THAT'S 
TAKING ADVANTAGE OF APPLICANTS

[Captioner] 21:14:39
, 
AND I HAD NOWHERE TO TURN

[Captioner] 21:14:43
 FOR 
HAVING AN AUDIT OR AN 
INVESTIGATION DONE

[Captioner] 21:14:47
 FOR THESE 
PEOPLE.
AND THAT IS

[Captioner] 21:14:50
 VERY DISTURBING FOR 
ME IF PEOPLE ARE

[Captioner] 21:14:53
 TAKING 
ADVANTAGE OF PEOPLE WHO BARELY 
HAVE TWO

[Captioner] 21:14:57
 PENNIES TO RUB 
TOGETHER.
I THINK THAT'S JUST WISE IN

[Captioner] 21:15:00
 
MAKING SURE THAT YOUR 
INVESTMENTS ARE

[Captioner] 21:15:04
 ALSO BEING 
PROTECTED.
THAT IS

[Captioner] 21:15:06
 TAXPAYERS, ALL OF US 
SHOULD BE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT 
KIND OF

[Captioner] 21:15:09
 THING.

[Captioner] 21:15:16

AND I JUST FEEL

[Captioner] 21:15:20
 LIKE THERE ARE A 
LOT OF

[Captioner] 21:15:23
 AGENCIES THAT CURRENTLY 
EXIST THAT COULD

[Captioner] 21:15:26
 BE ASSISTING 
PEOPLE WHO ARE LOW INCOME,

[Captioner] 21:15:30
 AT 
RISK, PEOPLE, I KNOW THAT WHEN

[Captioner] 21:15:33
 I 
WAS GOING THROUGH MY ISSUES, 
THERE

[Captioner] 21:15:36
 WAS NOTHING IN PLACE TO 
HELP KEEP ME HOUSE

[Captioner] 21:15:39
ED, WHILE I 
WAITED TO GET

[Captioner] 21:15:43
 INTO AFFORDABLE 
HOUSING.
AND I ENDED UP BEING

[Captioner] 21:15:46
 TOLD BY A 
NUMBER OF LOCAL AGENCIES TO CALL 
THEM

[Captioner] 21:15:49
 BACK WHEN I'M HOMELESS.
WHICH CLEARLY TELLS

[Captioner] 21:15:53
 ME THAT OUR 
MONEY IS GOING TO THE BACK END 
OF THE

[Captioner] 21:15:56
 PROBLEM.
WHICH IS MUCH MORE COST

[Captioner] 21:15:59
LY AND 
MUCH MORE INEFFICIENT

[Captioner] 21:16:03
 THAN IF 
THAT MONEY HAD BEEN USED TO KEEP 
ME HOUSED

[Captioner] 21:16:06
.


[Captioner] 21:16:14
>> The Clerk:   THE THEM SPEAKER 
IS JOHN HINES.


[Captioner] 21:16:20
 NEXT SPEAKER 
IS JOHN HINES.
>> HELLO EVERYONE.


[Captioner] 21:16:23
WE'VE HEARD VERY GOOD 
SUGGESTIONS WHAT WE SHOULD DO

[Captioner] 21:16:26
 
WITH SURPLUSES.
I'D LIKE TO ADD ANOTHER OR KEEP 


[Captioner] 21:16:30
ANOTHER ON THE LIST.
THAT'S ACCELERATING THE PAY DOWN

[Captioner] 21:16:33
 
OF THE UNFUNDED LIABILITIES.
IT IS NOT VERY

[Captioner] 21:16:36
 SEXY, NOBODY SEES 
IT AS A PROBLEM

[Captioner] 21:16:39
 UNTIL DISASTER 
HAPPENS AND DISASTER USUALLY 
DOESN'T HAPPEN SO

[Captioner] 21:16:42
 IT STAYS 
HIDDEN.
THERE WAS A TOWN IN MICHIGAN TEN

[Captioner] 21:16:45
 
OR 15 YEARS AGO, WHO HAD A LONG 
HAND

[Captioner] 21:16:50
 
HABIT OF ANY TIME THERE WAS A 
GOOD

[Captioner] 21:16:53
 YEAR THEY FOUND SOMETHING 
TO SPEND IT ON OTHER THAN THE

[Captioner] 21:16:55
 
PENSION PLAN.
BUT WHEN THE TROUBLE DID OCCUR 


[Captioner] 21:16:58
THEY WERE IN THIS AWFUL, AWFUL 
POSITION WHERE

[Captioner] 21:17:01
 THEY HAD TO 
EITHER END BENEFITS FOR

[Captioner] 21:17:05
 CITY 
EMPLOYEES WHO HAD ALREADY 
RETIRED AND WERE NO LONGER IN

[Captioner] 21:17:08
 A 
POSITION TO FIND ANY MORE INCOME 
OR

[Captioner] 21:17:11
 CUT BACK DRASTICALLY ON CITY 
SERVICES THAT

[Captioner] 21:17:14
 EVERYONE NEEDED.
SO THE IDEA OF HAVING AN 
UNFUNDED

[Captioner] 21:17:17
 LIABILITY FOR PENSIONS 
AT ALL IS SOMETHING

[Captioner] 21:17:20
 THAT'S NOT 
EVEN ACCEPTED IN THE PRIVATE 
SECTOR.


[Captioner] 21:17:23
STARTING IN THE LATE 70s

[Captioner] 21:17:27
 THERE 
WAS A FEDERAL LAW THAT REQUIRED 
COMPANIES TO

[Captioner] 21:17:30
 FUND PENSIONS 
IMMEDIATELY.
AND ONLY

[Captioner] 21:17:33
 GOVERNMENTS CAN GET 
AWAY WITHOUT DOING

[Captioner] 21:17:37
 THAT, WHICH 
DOESN'T MAKE IT A GOOD IDEA.
SO PLEASE,

[Captioner] 21:17:40
 IN THIS GREAT LIST OF 
IDEAS, FOR HOW TO

[Captioner] 21:17:43
 MAKE USE OF A 
SURPLUS, THINK OF THE 
OPPORTUNITY

[Captioner] 21:17:46
 TO CLOSE THE GAP ON 
THE UNFUNDED LIABILITY.
THANK YOU

[Captioner] 21:17:51
.


[Captioner] 21:17:56
>> Mayor Mei:   WAS THAT THE 
LAST OF OUR SPEAKERS?

[Captioner] 21:17:58

>> The Clerk:   YES, MA'AM.
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 21:18:01
I HAVEN'T MADE ANY COMMENTS YET 
BUT I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE

[Captioner] 21:18:05
 REAL 
QUICKLY REGARDING THE UNFUNDED 
LIABILITIES.

[Captioner] 21:18:08

AND I DON'T KNOW IF DIRECTOR 
PERSSELIN YOU WANT

[Captioner] 21:18:11
 TO COMMENT ON 
IT, HAS BEEN SOMETHING I TRULY

[Captioner] 21:18:15
 
VALUE MY COUNCIL

[Captioner] 21:18:16
 COLLEAGUES IN 
MAKING THE DECISIONS IN THE 
PAST.


[Captioner] 21:18:19
I KNOW IT'S VERY DIFFICULT WHEN 
IT COMES TO LOOKING AT THAT

[Captioner] 21:18:22
.
BUT WE HAVE ALWAYS AS A COUNCIL 
MADE A PRIORITY

[Captioner] 21:18:25
.
BECAUSE IT'S A RAPIDLY GROWING 
AREA.


[Captioner] 21:18:29
IT'S LIKE NOT PAYING YOUR CREDIT 
CARD AND HAVING THE INTEREST

[Captioner] 21:18:32
 
RATES, I THINK THAT WOULD BE 
SOMETHING THAT A COMMON FERN 


[Captioner] 21:18:35
 PERSON

[Captioner] 21:18:38
 
WOULD UNDERSTAND MORE.
THAT'S WHY AS A COUNCIL PRIORITY 


[Captioner] 21:18:41
WE HAD MADE A POLICY DECISION 
AND I DON'T KNOW IF DIRECTOR

[Captioner] 21:18:43
 
PERSSELIN YOU WANT TO SHARE UPON 
THAT.


[Captioner] 21:18:46
>> David Persselin:   SURE.
SO FIVE YEARS AGO THE CITY 
COUNCIL OF THE

[Captioner] 21:18:49
 CITY OF FREMONT 
ADOPTED A POLICY TO INCLUDE

[Captioner] 21:18:53
 AN 
ADDITIONAL CONTRIBUTION

[Captioner] 21:18:56
 TOWARD 
PAYING DOWN OUR UNFUNDED PENSION 
LIABILITY

[Captioner] 21:18:59
 AS PART OF THE 
PROPOSED BUDGET EVERY SINGLE 
YEAR

[Captioner] 21:19:02
.
IN AN AMOUNT THAT'S AT

[Captioner] 21:19:06
 LEAST 
EQUAL TO 10% OF THE REQUIRED 
UNFUND

[Captioner] 21:19:09
ED LIABILITY CONTRIBUTION.
AND FOR THE LAST FIVE YEARS 
WE'VE

[Captioner] 21:19:12
 MADE THOSE ADDITIONAL 
CONTRIBUTIONS.
AND

[Captioner] 21:19:15
 I'D ALSO NOTE THAT EARLIER 
THIS YEAR

[Captioner] 21:19:19
 THE CITY COUNCIL VOTED 
TO USE $10 MILLION OF

[Captioner] 21:19:22
 
UNANTICIPATED SALES TAX REVENUE 
TO MAKE

[Captioner] 21:19:25
 AN ADDITIONAL 
CONTRIBUTION TOWARDS

[Captioner] 21:19:28
 PAYING DOWN 
OUR UNFUNDED RETIREE

[Captioner] 21:19:32
 HEALTH CARE 
LIABILITY.
AND

[Captioner] 21:19:35
 IN ADDITION TO REDUCING THAT 
LIABILITY SIGNIFICANTLY

[Captioner] 21:19:39
, THAT 
$10 MILLION CONTRIBUTION

[Captioner] 21:19:42
 WILL 
SERVE TO REDUCE OUR ONGOING

[Captioner] 21:19:45
 
OPERATING COSTS MOVING FORWARD, 
BECAUSE THE

[Captioner] 21:19:49
 AMOUNT LEFT PAID 
EACH YEAR IS CORRESPONDINGLY

[Captioner] 21:19:52
 
LESS BY ABOUT $1 MILLION A YEAR.
SO THE CITY COUNCIL

[Captioner] 21:19:56
, THE CITY OF 
FREMONT, HAS ABSOLUTELY

[Captioner] 21:19:59
 MADE A 
COMMITMENT TO PAYING DOWN OUR 
UNFUNDED LIABILITIES

[Captioner] 21:20:02
 AND WE'RE 
MAKING GREAT PROGRESS IN THAT 
DIRECTION

[Captioner] 21:20:05
.
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.
I KNOW THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S 


[Captioner] 21:20:08
VERY IMPORTANT TO OUR COUNCIL, 
AND THAT WE STRONGLY

[Captioner] 21:20:11
 FEEL AND I 
APPRECIATE THE SPEAKER

[Captioner] 21:20:14
 MR. HINES 
FOR REFERENCING IT.
I KNOW IT'S NOT AS

[Captioner] 21:20:17
 MANY PEOPLE 
MENTIONED SEXY IN TERMS OF ONE 
OF THE

[Captioner] 21:20:21
 MORE POPULAR, NECESSARY 
ITEMS ON A BUDGET BUT

[Captioner] 21:20:24
 I THINK 
IT'S REALLY CRITICAL AND THAT'S 
WHY WE'VE BEEN RECOGNIZED

[Captioner] 21:20:27
 FOR 
OUR FISCAL SOLVENCY AND 
THOUGHTFULNESS

[Captioner] 21:20:32
.
I ALSO WAS GOING

[Captioner] 21:20:35
 TO MENTION THAT 
I AX SUPPORTIVE OF PUTTING THE 
SET

[Captioner] 21:20:38
 ASIDE.
I KNOW PEOPLE WOULD COMMENT AND 
THERE

[Captioner] 21:20:41
 HAS BEEN QUESTION IN THE 
PAST OF AUTO SALES AND

[Captioner] 21:20:43
 I 
APPRECIATE MY COUNCILMEMBER FOR 
ASKING THAT.


[Captioner] 21:20:47
THAT'S WHY WHEN WE HAD LOOKED AT 
THE SPIKES THAT YOU SAW IN SOME

[Captioner] 21:20:50
 
OF THE EARLIER CYCLES WHEN YOU 
ARE LOOKING AT THOSE

[Captioner] 21:20:53
 PAST TRENDS 
WE HAD SEEN IT WAS VERY CYCLICAL 
AND

[Captioner] 21:20:56
 A LITTLE BIT UNPREDICTABLE.
KNOWING THAT WE

[Captioner] 21:20:59
 PUT THE RESERVED 
AND ACTUALLY IT FARED

[Captioner] 21:21:02
 VERY WELL 
FOR US AS A COUNCIL AND AS A 
CITY.

[Captioner] 21:21:05

BECAUSE WHEN THE PANDEMIC HIT, 
MANY OF THE

[Captioner] 21:21:08
 CITIES COULDN'T 
ANTICIPATE SOME OF THE NATURAL 
DISASTERS THEY HAD

[Captioner] 21:21:11
 BEEN SEEING, 
IT ALLOWED US FLUIDITY

[Captioner] 21:21:15
 TO NOT 
HAVE TO MAKE THE CUTS.
SO WE

[Captioner] 21:21:19
 DID SPEND THAT DOWN.
THANK YOU TO THE ARPA

[Captioner] 21:21:22
 FUND THAT 
WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO HAVE SOME 
OF THAT RESTORED

[Captioner] 21:21:25
.
JUST TO CLARIFY, I WANTED TO 
MAKE A

[Captioner] 21:21:29
 QUICK COMMENT.
I THINK THERE WAS A SPEAKER THAT

[Captioner] 21:21:32
 
ASKED ABOUT US ADDING $2.5 
MILLION

[Captioner] 21:21:35
 TO UNANTICIPATED BUDGET 
IMPACTS, SO

[Captioner] 21:21:38
 IT'S ACTUALLY 12.5 
MILLION IF I'M CORRECT

[Captioner] 21:21:42
 DIRECTOR 
PERSSELIN.


[Captioner] 21:21:45
>> David Persselin:   THAT'S 
CORRECT, 12.5 MILLION WOULD BE 
THE TOTAL.

[Captioner] 21:21:47

>> Mayor Mei:   OKAY I JUST 
WANTED TO CLARIFY.


[Captioner] 21:21:51
AND THEN COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN 
DID YOU HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION

[Captioner] 21:21:54
?
>> Councilmember Kassan:   YES,

[Captioner] 21:21:57
 
THANK YOU.
WELL I REALLY APPRECIATED THE 


[Captioner] 21:22:01
COMMENTS OF KATHERINE AND CHRIS.
I WAS REALLY TOUCHED BY WHAT

[Captioner] 21:22:04
 
CHRIS SAID WHEN HE SAID ASK A 
HOMELESS

[Captioner] 21:22:07
 PERSON IF IT'S A RAINY 
DAY RIGHT NOW.

[Captioner] 21:22:10

AND I KNOW WE DO HAVE AN AGENDA 
ITEM

[Captioner] 21:22:13
 LATER ON THE AGENDA ABOUT 
WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THE

[Captioner] 21:22:16
 
HOMELESSNESS SITUATION IN 
FREMONT.


[Captioner] 21:22:23
AND WE ARE SPENDING SO MUCH 
MONEY ON

[Captioner] 21:22:26
 QUOTE UNQUOTE 
MITIGATION AND WE COULD

[Captioner] 21:22:29
 
POTENTIALLY SAVE THAT MUCH MONEY 
BY DOING MORE TO PREVENT THE

[Captioner] 21:22:32
 
PROBLEM AND POSSIBLY, YOU KNOW, 
MAYBE

[Captioner] 21:22:35
 GO AHEAD AND DO THE OTHER 
PRONGS OF THE SAFE PARK

[Captioner] 21:22:38
ING 
PROGRAM.
I IMAGINE OUR

[Captioner] 21:22:42
 STAFF THAT 
SPECIALIZES IN SUPPORTING OUR

[Captioner] 21:22:45
 
HOMELESS POPULATION AND HELPING 
THEM GET INTO

[Captioner] 21:22:48
 PERMANENT HOUSING 
AND ALSO PREVENTION OF 
HOMELESSNESS WOULD HAVE

[Captioner] 21:22:51
 LOTS OF 
IDEAS OF HOW TO SPEND SOME OF 
THIS MONEY.


[Captioner] 21:22:54
SO I REALLY UNDERSTAND THE 
DESIRE TO ADD

[Captioner] 21:22:57
 TO THE BUDGET 
UNCERTAINTY RESERVE AND THE 
DESIRE TO

[Captioner] 21:23:00
 ADD MORE FUNDING TO 
THE CIP.

[Captioner] 21:23:04

BUT I JUST WAS REALLY MOVED BY 
WHAT CHRIS

[Captioner] 21:23:07
 AND KATHERINE SAID 
AND IT JUST REMIND

[Captioner] 21:23:10
ED ME THAT WE 
ARE ABOUT TO TALK ABOUT HOMELESS 
ISSUES

[Captioner] 21:23:13
.
AND THE LESS WE ADDRESS THE ROOT 
OF THE PROBLEM

[Captioner] 21:23:16
 BY PREVENTING 
HOMELESSNESS AND HELPING THOSE 
WHO ARE HOMELESS

[Captioner] 21:23:20
 TO GET INTO 
AFFORDABLE HOUSING, THE MORE 
EXPENSIVE

[Captioner] 21:23:23
 IT DOES BECOME TO DEAL 
WITH THE QUOTE UNQUOTE

[Captioner] 21:23:26
 
MITIGATION ISSUES.
SO I DO WONDER IF THERE'S

[Captioner] 21:23:31
 
ANYTHING THAT OUR HUMAN SERVICES 
DEPARTMENT COULD

[Captioner] 21:23:34
 USE SOME 
FUNDING FOR THAT COULD ADDRESS

[Captioner] 21:23:37
 
THE ROOT CAUSES AND NEED

[Captioner] 21:23:40
 TO GET 
PEOPLE INTO PERMANENT HOUSING 
THAT WE COULD MAYBE

[Captioner] 21:23:44
 ALLOCATE A 
PORTION OF THIS FUNDING TO,

[Captioner] 21:23:47
 
INSTEAD OF PUTTING IT ALL INTO 
THE CIP.


[Captioner] 21:23:50
THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU

[Captioner] 21:23:54
.
I WAS GOING TO MAKE A COMMENT 
THAT I REALLY

[Captioner] 21:23:57
 APPRECIATE THIS 
LAST COUPLE OF YEARS AND I WANT 
TO PUBLIC TO UNDERSTAND

[Captioner] 21:24:00
, WE 
ABSOLUTELY UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT 
OF PREVENT

[Captioner] 21:24:04
ING HOMELESSNESS AS 
MUCH AS IT IS FOR THE OTHER

[Captioner] 21:24:07
 
AREAS, THAT'S WHY WE'VE GIVEN 
OUT A DIRECT ALLOCATION

[Captioner] 21:24:10
 WHICH 
WE'RE VERY GRATEFUL TO HAVE BEEN 
ABLE TO HAVE.

[Captioner] 21:24:13

BECAUSE ORIGINALLY WITH THE 
C.A.R.E.S. MONEY IT

[Captioner] 21:24:17
 WAS ONLY 
GOING TO CITIES BIGGER THAN 500

[Captioner] 21:24:20

500,000 PEOPLE AND IN THE PAST 
YEAR AND A HALF WE HAVE

[Captioner] 21:24:23
 GIVEN 
OUT OVER $16 MILLION IN 
DIRECTION ALLOCATION

[Captioner] 21:24:26
 FOR RENTAL 
ASSISTANCE.
I THINK THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT.


[Captioner] 21:24:29
ALSO AS A CITY WHERE WE HAVE 
MANY FAMILIES WHICH

[Captioner] 21:24:32
 ARE 
IMMIGRANTS AND WE TALKED ABOUT 
THE NEED FOR HELPING IN THOSE 


[Captioner] 21:24:35
SITUATIONS AND I WANT TO THANK 
THE PEOPLE IN THE OTHER 40 STAYS 
THAT

[Captioner] 21:24:38
 HAVE STEPPED UP TO HELP US 
RAISE OVER $

[Captioner] 21:24:42
600,000 IN

[Captioner] 21:24:45
 AFGHAN 
REFUGEE ASSISTANCE AND WE'VE 
ALSO HAD

[Captioner] 21:24:48
 ALMOST HALF A MILLION 
IN DONATIONS.
SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE

[Captioner] 21:24:52
 WAYS.
I DO AGREE WITH THE IDEA AND 
WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT HOME

[Captioner] 21:24:55

HOMELESSNESS WHICH IS WHY THERE 
IS A COUNTY WIDE PLAN.


[Captioner] 21:24:58
I KNOW THAT A

[Captioner] 21:25:01
 SPEAKER EARLIER 
TONIGHT REFERENCED THERE HAS 
BEEN

[Captioner] 21:25:05
 AUDITING OF SOME OF THESE 
PROGRAMS IN DIFFERENT CITIES

[Captioner] 21:25:08
 AND 
THAT'S ALSO WHY WE'VE HAD A SIX 
MONTH

[Captioner] 21:25:11
 REPORT ONE YEAR REPORT AND 
ALSO TWO YEAR REPORT THAT WILL

[Captioner] 21:25:14
 
BE FORTH COME FOR HOUSING 
NAVIGATION CENTER.


[Captioner] 21:25:17
BECAUSE WE DO SEE THE RESULTS, 
THE QUESTIONS OF WHO IS

[Captioner] 21:25:20
 BEING 
SERVED, HOW IT'S

[Captioner] 21:25:23
 BEING SERVED 
AND AS WE TALK ABOUT THE  
HOMELESS

[Captioner] 21:25:27
NESS ITEM.
>> Councilmember Kassan:   I 
WANTED TO CLARIFY THAT IS

[Captioner] 21:25:29
 A 
QUESTION FOR THE HUMAN SERVICES 
TEAM.


[Captioner] 21:25:32
I'M SURE, IT IS A

[Captioner] 21:25:36
 COMMENT

[Captioner] 21:25:40
 A 
QUESTION NOT A COMMENT.
>> COUNCILMEMBER

[Captioner] 21:25:43
 KASSAN, WE WILL 
BE COVERING THAT TOPIC IN DAME 
WITH OUR KIND

[Captioner] 21:25:46
 OF RECOMMENDED 
NEXT STEP.
>> Councilmember Kassan:   BUT 


[Captioner] 21:25:49
WE HAVE TO VOTE ON THIS FIRST SO 
I THOUGHT IT WAS IMPORTANT TO 
BRING

[Captioner] 21:25:52
 IT UP BEFORE WE VOTE ON 
THIS BUDGET, THE BUDGET

[Captioner] 21:25:55
 
RECOMMENDATIONS.
>> I DON'T KNOW IF STAFF

[Captioner] 21:25:58
 IS 
PREPARED TO RESPOND ACCURATELY 
OR IN DETAIL TO YOUR

[Captioner] 21:26:01
 QUESTION 
WITH RESPECT TO THE BUDGET 
PROPOSAL TONIGHT.


[Captioner] 21:26:04
AND HUMAN SERVICES OR HOMELESS 
PROGRAMS

[Captioner] 21:26:07
.
SO THAT WOULD BE MY 
RECOMMENDATION, IS

[Captioner] 21:26:10
 TO LISTEN OR 
DISCUSS THE UPCOMING

[Captioner] 21:26:13
 AGENDA ITEM 
AND

[Captioner] 21:26:17
 PROCEED ACCORDINGLY.
>> Mayor Mei:   I ALSO WANTED

[Captioner] 21:26:20
 TO 
NOTE THAT WHILE ONE OF ITS BEING 
ALLOCATE

[Captioner] 21:26:23
ED AND SPECIFICALLY INTO 
TWO DIFFERENT BUCKETS,

[Captioner] 21:26:26
 ONE OF 
THOSE IS UNANTICIPATED AND 
UNRESERVE

[Captioner] 21:26:30
 ENDING FUND BALANCE 
WHICH DURING THAT CONVERSATION 
IF

[Captioner] 21:26:33
 WE AFTER HAVING THE BUDGET 
UPDATE OR THE HOME

[Captioner] 21:26:37
 HOMELESS 
DISCUSSION, HAVING THE 
UNALLOCATED OR

[Captioner] 21:26:40
 UNRESERVE ENDING 
FUND BALANCE ALLOWS US

[Captioner] 21:26:43
 THE 
CAPABILITY WHEN WE GO OUT FOR 
PROJECTS TO BE ABLE TO COMPETE

[Captioner] 21:26:46
 
FOR MATCHING GRANTS.
AND THE COUNTY RIGHT NOW IS 


[Captioner] 21:26:49
LOOKING AT A HOME TOGETHER PLAN 
AND LOOKING AT SOME OF THE 
COHESIVE

[Captioner] 21:26:53
 WAYS THAT WE CAN RULE 
AND

[Captioner] 21:26:56
 TO PARTNER WITH FOR EXAMPLE 
SURROUNDING CITIES WE ARE PART

[Captioner] 21:26:59
 
OF SOUTH COUNTY SO WE ALSO ARE 
WORKING AND WE

[Captioner] 21:27:03
 HAVE ACTUALLY 
MONTHLY MEETINGS, WITH THE

[Captioner] 21:27:06
 
DIFFERENT CITIES, TO TALK ABOUT 
SOME OF THE HOMELESSNESS

[Captioner] 21:27:09
 
APPLICATIONS AROUND HOW WORKING 
TOGETHER WE

[Captioner] 21:27:16
 ARE WORKING ON SOME 
OF THE RESOLUTIONS ON THIS PLAN.

[Captioner] 21:27:19

WE ACTUALLY HAVE A 
REPRESENTATIVE FROM OUR STAFF

[Captioner] 21:27:23
, 
LORIE

[Captioner] 21:27:28
 AND SUZANNE SHENFIL, THAT

[Captioner] 21:27:31
 
BEING SAID, I KNOW THIS IS AN 
ACTION ITEM THIS

[Captioner] 21:27:34
 EVENING TO TALK 
ABOUT THE ALLOCATIONS AND 
SPECIFICALLY,

[Captioner] 21:27:37
 THE TWO 
RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE STAFF

[Captioner] 21:27:41
.
SO LET ME PULL THIS UP.
AND

[Captioner] 21:27:44
 THAT IS FOR DIRECTOR 
PERSSELIN COULD YOU SUMMARIZE

[Captioner] 21:27:46
 
THAT FOR ME?
I KNOW THAT THERE'S TWO ITEMS 


[Captioner] 21:27:49
THAT WE ARE ASKING TO TAKE 
ACTION THIS EVENING.

[Captioner] 21:27:52

>> David Persselin:   RIGHT.
SO WE RECOMMENDED THAT THE CITY 


[Captioner] 21:27:56
COUNCIL ALLOCATE $2.5 MILLION OF 
THE AVAILABLE

[Captioner] 21:27:59
 ENDING FUND 
BALANCE TO INCREASE THE BUDGET

[Captioner] 21:28:02
 
UNCERTAINTY RESERVE, AND TO 
ALLOCATE

[Captioner] 21:28:05
 THE SECOND ITEM IS TO 
ALLOCATE THE APPROXIMATELY $

[Captioner] 21:28:08
10.7 
MILLION REMAINING

[Captioner] 21:28:12
 TO A TRANSFER 
TO THE CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT

[Captioner] 21:28:15
 FUND 
WHICH WOULD BE USED TO SUPPORT 
THE CAPITAL

[Captioner] 21:28:19
 IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM 
THAT WILL COME TO THE CITY 
COUNCIL IN

[Captioner] 21:28:22
 2023.
>> Mayor Mei:   I ALSO WANTED

[Captioner] 21:28:25
 TO 
NOTE AND PERHAPS DIRECTOR 
PERSSELIN YOU CAN

[Captioner] 21:28:28
 CLARIFY.
WHEN IT COMES TO CAPITAL 
IMPROVEMENT PROGRAMS,

[Captioner] 21:28:31
 WHAT IS 
THAT SPECIFICALLY DETAIL?
I KNOW SOME OF IT HAS

[Captioner] 21:28:34
 BEEN ON 
ROADWAYS, SOME OF IT HAS BEEN 
DIFFERENT

[Captioner] 21:28:38
 PROJECTS.
BUT AT THAT TIME WHEN WE'RE 
LOOKING AT THE CAPITAL

[Captioner] 21:28:41
 
IMPROVEMENT PLAN AS WE HAVE IN 
PAST YEARS WE DO TALK ABOUT ALL 


[Captioner] 21:28:44
THE DIFFERENT PROJECTS.
WOULD SOMETHING LIKE A SAFE 
PARKING

[Captioner] 21:28:48
 PROGRAM OR IF IT'S A 
PHYSICAL STRUCTURE THAT WE'RE

[Captioner] 21:28:51
 
LOOKING AT TO IMPLEMENT BE ALSO 
CONSIDERED A

[Captioner] 21:28:57
 A EXAM IMPROVEMENT?

[Captioner] 21:29:00

>> David Persselin:   SO 
PHYSICAL STRUCTURES ARE CAPITAL 


[Captioner] 21:29:03
IMPROVEMENTS.
ONE OF THE SPEAKERS TONIGHT DID 
A PRETTY

[Captioner] 21:29:06
 GOOD JOB OF IDENTIFYING 
THE

[Captioner] 21:29:10
 MAJOR PROJECTS THAT ARE 
INCLUDED IN THE CITY'S

[Captioner] 21:29:13
 CAPITAL 
IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM.
THAT INCLUDES THINGS LIKE ADA

[Captioner] 21:29:16
 
COMPLIANCE IMPROVEMENTS.
IT INCLUDES THE 50-50 SIDEWALK

[Captioner] 21:29:20
 
STREET TREE PROGRAM.
IT INCLUDES PAVEMENT MAINTENANCE

[Captioner] 21:29:23

MAINTENANCE.
IT ALSO INCLUDES CITY 


[Captioner] 21:29:27
FACILITIES, TECHNOLOGY, TO THE 
EXTENT THAT

[Captioner] 21:29:30
, YOU KNOW, 
SOMETHING, SOMETHING INVOLVES 
EITHER PHYSICAL STRUCTURE

[Captioner] 21:29:35
 OR 
TECHNOLOGICAL INFRASTRUCTURE, 
THEN THAT

[Captioner] 21:29:38
 WOULD BE INCLUDED IN 
THE CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM

[Captioner] 21:29:41
.
>> AND MAYOR IF I MAY JUST TO 
CLARIFY.


[Captioner] 21:29:44
IN THIS SCHOLAR BUDGET THE

[Captioner] 21:29:48
 CITY 
COUNCIL DID AUTHORIZE FUNDING 
FOR A STRATEGIC PLAN WITH REGARD

[Captioner] 21:29:50
 
TO HOMELESSNESS IN THE CITY OF 
FREMONT.


[Captioner] 21:29:54
WITHOUT STRAYING TOO MUCH INTO 
THE NEXT AGENDA ITEM THAT WILL 
BE A

[Captioner] 21:29:57
 RECOMMENDATION THAT THE 
CITY PROCEED WITH THAT ACTION 
FOLLOWING TONIGHT'S ITEM

[Captioner] 21:30:00
.
AND CERTAINLY ANY 
RECOMMENDATIONS

[Captioner] 21:30:04
 OR PROJECTS 
ARTICULATED IN THAT

[Captioner] 21:30:07
 MASTER PLAN 
WOULD THEN BE POTENTIALLY 
ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE CIP

[Captioner] 21:30:12
.
>> Mayor Mei:   SO I JUST WANTED 
TO LET

[Captioner] 21:30:15
 PEOPLE KNOW I KNOW THAT 
THIS WILL BE AN AREA OF TOPIC 
THAT

[Captioner] 21:30:18
 WE'LL BE COVERING IN THE 
NEXT AGENDA ITEM SO SOME OF THAT

[Captioner] 21:30:21
 
CAN BE APPLIED AS PART OF OUR 
CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PLAN

[Captioner] 21:30:24
 BE IT 
THE ADA, BE IT SOME OF THE 
CONVERSATIONS HOW

[Captioner] 21:30:27
 WE WANT TO 
ADDRESS AND ALSO THIS WEEK FOR 
THE PUBLIC IN CASE

[Captioner] 21:30:31
 SOME PEOPLE 
DIDN'T KNOW WE ALSO SECURED SOME 
FUNDING THROUGH

[Captioner] 21:30:34
 OUR LEGISLATORS 
FOR SPECIFICALLY OUR TEEN

[Captioner] 21:30:37
 CENTER 
AND SOME OF THE OTHER AREAS.
SO THOSE WILL THEN

[Captioner] 21:30:40
 BE MARRIED 
TOGETHER IN TERMS OF PARTNERING 
THOSE TO MAKE IT

[Captioner] 21:30:44
 A MORE 
ATTRACTIVE COMPREHENSIVE

[Captioner] 21:30:47
 
PROGRAM.
I DON'T KNOW I SEE ALL

[Captioner] 21:30:50
 THESE 
DIFFERENT BUTTONS THAT ARE 
COMING UP

[Captioner] 21:30:54
.
COUNCILMEMBER SHAO, 
COUNCILMEMBER COX

[Captioner] 21:30:58
, COUNCILMEMBER 
SALWAN, DO WE

[Captioner] 21:31:01
 HAVE MORE 
COMMENTS?
COUNCILMEMBER SHAO.


[Captioner] 21:31:05
>> Councilmember Shao:   THANK 
YOU MADAM MAYOR.
I WANTED TO MAKE A COMMENT, THE

[Captioner] 21:31:08
 
CITY GIVE THE POLICE OFFICERS A 
RAISE IN SPRING OF

[Captioner] 21:31:11
 2021.
HE MAY BE TALKING ABOUT ANOTHER 
CITY

[Captioner] 21:31:14
 BECAUSE NOT ONLY THE POLICE 
OFFICERS BUT ALL THE CITY 
EMPLOYEES

[Captioner] 21:31:17
, BECAUSE OF THE 
PANDEMIC, VOLUNTARILY TOOK A

[Captioner] 21:31:21
 
YEAR OF SALARY INCREASE FREEZE

[Captioner] 21:31:24
 
TO SUPPORT THE CITY, GO THROUGH 
THE PANDEMIC

[Captioner] 21:31:27
.
AND WE REALLY APPRECIATE THAT

[Captioner] 21:31:30
.
SECONDLY, I JUST

[Captioner] 21:31:33
 WANT TO COMMENT 
THAT ON ONE HAND

[Captioner] 21:31:37
 WE SEE THIS 
SURPLUS, IT'S VERY GOOD

[Captioner] 21:31:40
 THING.
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND, I SEE

[Captioner] 21:31:43
 
THAT SOME OF THE SURPLUS IS FROM 
THE VACANCY

[Captioner] 21:31:46
 SAVINGS WHICH MEANS 
THAT WE HAVE TO

[Captioner] 21:31:49
 REALLY WORK HARD 
TO FILL THE

[Captioner] 21:31:52
 VACANCIES OF THE 
ADDITIONAL POLICE OFFICERS 
POSITIONS

[Captioner] 21:31:56
, TWO POLICE OFFICERS 
AND NINE FIREFIGHTERS POSITIONS

[Captioner] 21:32:00
 
IN OUR EFFORTS OF RECRUITMENT

[Captioner] 21:32:04
 IN 
THE NEAR FUTURE SO THAT WE DON'T 
TRY

[Captioner] 21:32:08
 TO SAVE MONEY BY 
COMPROMISING

[Captioner] 21:32:11
 OUR PUBLIC SAFETY 
STRENGTH IN GENERAL.

THOUGHTFUL.
OUR CITY ATTORNEY

[Captioner] 21:35:03
 RAFAEL AFERLTD

WE'LL BEGIN WITH QUESTIONS

[Captioner] 21:35:06
 FROM 
THE COUNCILMEMBERS.


[Captioner] 21:35:10
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN.
>> Councilmember Salwan:   NO 
QUESTION, JUST A COMMENT THAT

[Captioner] 21:35:13
 WE 
CAN PROBABLY ADD THE HINDU 
HERITAGE

[Captioner] 21:35:17
 MONTH AND MUSLIM 
APPRECIATION MONTH FOR OCTOBER,

[Captioner] 21:35:19
 
I DIDN'T SEE THAT ON THE LIST IF 
THAT'S OKAY.


[Captioner] 21:35:23
>> Mayor Mei:   OKAY.
SORRY,

[Captioner] 21:35:26
 THERE'S ONE OTHER HAND I 
JUST MUST HAVE ACCIDENTALLY,

[Captioner] 21:35:29
 
COUNCILMEMBER COX DO YOU HAVE 
ANOTHER COMMENT ON THE COUNCIL 


[Captioner] 21:35:33
HANDBOOK?
>> Councilmember Cox:   ONE OF 
THE THINGS THAT WASN'T CLEAR

[Captioner] 21:35:36
, IN 
THE HANDBOOK, IS

[Captioner] 21:35:40
 WHEN 
PROCLAMATIONS ARE MADE, ARE THEY

[Captioner] 21:35:43
 
MADE REGARDING THE CITY OF 
FREMONT,

[Captioner] 21:35:46
 AND THE

[Captioner] 21:35:49
 ORGANIZATIONS, 
THAT WASN'T CLEAR IN OUR HANDLED 
BOOKER

[Captioner] 21:35:53
 
HANDBOOK.
>> I'M NOT

[Captioner] 21:35:56
 SURE I UNDERSTAND THE 
QUESTION, COUNCILMEMBER COX.
>> Councilmember Cox:  

[Captioner] 21:35:59
 THE 
QUESTION IS IF THERE'S A 
PROCLAMATION GIVEN THAT WE WANT 


[Captioner] 21:36:02
TO MAKE SURE SINCE IT'S USING 
OUR TAXPAYERS

[Captioner] 21:36:05
, FREMONT TAXPAYERS 
MONEYS THAT IT'S REGARDING 
ORGANIZATIONS

[Captioner] 21:36:09
 THAT ARE IN OR 
RELATED TO FREMONT RESIDENTS

[Captioner] 21:36:12
, 
RIGHT?
>> YES.


[Captioner] 21:36:15
THE COUNCIL HANDBOOK IN THE

[Captioner] 21:36:22
 APPENDIX 
RECEIVES THERE HAS TO BE SOME 
CONNECTION

[Captioner] 21:36:25
 TO THE CITY OF 
FREMONT.
THE APPENDIX DOES INCLUDE 


[Captioner] 21:36:28
LANGUAGE THAT SPECIFIES THAT 
REQUIREMENT.
>> Councilmember Cox:   I JUST 


[Captioner] 21:36:31
WANTED TO DOUBLE CHECK BECAUSE 
IT DIDN'T KIND OF POP OUT

[Captioner] 21:36:34
 AT ME 
FOR THAT CLARIFICATION.
ONE OTHER THING I

[Captioner] 21:36:38
 DID HAVE 
ADDITIONAL LIST

[Captioner] 21:36:42
 OF CELEBRATIONS 
THAT I THINK

[Captioner] 21:36:45
 WOULD BE IMPORTANT.
AND ALSO MAKE SURE WE'RE 
OBSERVING

[Captioner] 21:36:49
 IT IN THE CORRECT 
MONTH

[Captioner] 21:36:53
.

[Captioner] 21:36:56

THAT WE'RE ABLE TO MAKE SURE 
THAT KIND OF GETS CLEANED UP A 


[Captioner] 21:36:59
LITTLE BIT SO THAT WE KNOW, FOR 
EXAMPLE,

[Captioner] 21:37:04
 THE

[Captioner] 21:37:07
 SIKH APPRECIATION 
MONTH

[Captioner] 21:37:11
 IS TRADITIONALLY 
CELEBRATED IN APRIL AND IT WAS 
DONE IN NOVEMBER

[Captioner] 21:37:14
.
AND I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT 
THERE ARE

[Captioner] 21:37:17
 CERTAIN CULTURAL 
OBSERVANCES THAT ARE BY THE

[Captioner] 21:37:19
 
CALENDAR THAT WE ARE FOLLOWING 
THAT.


[Captioner] 21:37:22
FOR ANOTHER ONE FOR JANUARY,

[Captioner] 21:37:26
 
INDIA REPUBLIC DAY, IN MARCH,

[Captioner] 21:37:30
 
CESAR CHAVEZ DAY, IN APRIL I 
JUST MENTION

[Captioner] 21:37:33
 BED THE SIKH 
APPRECIATION MONTH.
THERE IS

[Captioner] 21:37:37
ED ABOUT THE

[Captioner] 21:37:40
 SIKH 
APPRECIATION MONTH.
IN MAY NATIONAL PET MONTH AND IN 


[Captioner] 21:37:43
JULY IT KIND OF GETS A LITTLE 
BIT MORE CELEBRATION

[Captioner] 21:37:46
S BECAUSE WE 
DO NOT HAVE

[Captioner] 21:37:50
 OUR MEETINGS, WE 
HAVE A RECESS IN THE MONTH OF 
AUGUST.

[Captioner] 21:37:53

AND SO AND ADDITIONALLY

[Captioner] 21:37:56
 THE 
AFGHAN AMERICAN HERITAGE MONTH,

[Captioner] 21:38:00
 
SHOULD BE ONE THAT WOULD BE 
CONDUCT

[Captioner] 21:38:04
ED FOR JULY.
AND I KNOW THAT

[Captioner] 21:38:07
 MY COUNCILMEMBER 
SALWAN HAD MENTIONED ABOUT

[Captioner] 21:38:10
 THE 
AMERICAN MUSLIM APPRECIATION 
AWARENESS MONTH,

[Captioner] 21:38:13
 THAT SHOULD 
REALLY BE DONE IN JULY

[Captioner] 21:38:16
.
IN LOOKING AT THE CORRECTNESS OF 
THE CELEBRATION

[Captioner] 21:38:19
S AND THE DATES.
AND

[Captioner] 21:38:22
 PAKISTAN AMERICAN HERITAGE 
MONTH WOULD ALSO BE

[Captioner] 21:38:25
 DONE IN 
JULY.
AND

[Captioner] 21:38:29
 AS FAR AS

[Captioner] 21:38:33
 IN SEPTEMBER, THE 
HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH

[Captioner] 21:38:36
 GOES 
FROM THE MID PART OF SEPTEMBER 
TO THE MID PART OF

[Captioner] 21:38:39
 OCTOBER.


[Captioner] 21:38:44
AND LOOKING AT ALSO SINCE WE ARE 
THE HOME OF THE

[Captioner] 21:38:49
 CALIFORNIA D

[Captioner] 21:38:52
 DEAF 
SCHOOL, IT WOULD BE RECOGNIZING 
THE DEAF AWARENESS MONTH

[Captioner] 21:38:56
 AS 
WELL.
AND FOR OCTOBER

[Captioner] 21:39:00
, I KNOW THAT 
REPLY COLLEAGUE HAD ALREADY 
MENTIONED ABOUT

[Captioner] 21:39:03
 THE HINDU 
APPRECIATION.
FOR OCTOBER

[Captioner] 21:39:07
 ALSO WE'RE 
CELEBRATING IN FACT THIS COMING 
THURSDAY IS

[Captioner] 21:39:10
 EARTHQUAKE READINESS 
DAY AND I THINK THAT WOULD BE 
SOMETHING THAT

[Captioner] 21:39:13
 WOULD ALSO, WE 
SHOULD BE ADDING THAT

[Captioner] 21:39:16
 TO OUR 
CALENDAR.
BECAUSE THAT'S A

[Captioner] 21:39:19
 STATEWIDE EVENT 
THAT EVERYONE DOES ACROSS

[Captioner] 21:39:22
 EVERY 
CITY.
AND NATIONAL

[Captioner] 21:39:26
 DISABILITY 
AWARENESS MONTH WOULD BE ANOTHER 
ONE THAT'S CONDUCTED

[Captioner] 21:39:30
 IN OCTOBER.
AND

[Captioner] 21:39:33
 THE FILIPINO HERITAGE MONTH 
SHOULD BE CELEBRATED IN THE

[Captioner] 21:39:36
 
MONTH OF OCTOBER AS WELL.
AND

[Captioner] 21:39:39
 THEN WHEN YOU GET TO 
NOVEMBER WE DID CELEBRATE LAST

[Captioner] 21:39:42
 
YEAR THE SMALL BUSINESS DAY.
THAT ALSO

[Captioner] 21:39:45
 SHOULD BE ADDED FOR 
NOVEMBER.
AND FOR

[Captioner] 21:39:48
 DECEMBER, WE SHOULD BE 
LOOKING AT

[Captioner] 21:39:52
 WORLD AIDS AWARENESS 
MONTH AND NATIONAL

[Captioner] 21:39:55
 HUMAN RIGHTS 
MONTH IN DECEMBER.


[Captioner] 21:39:59
>> Mayor Mei:   SO WE MIGHT WANT 
TO TAKE SOME OF THIS OFFLINE.
I

[Captioner] 21:40:02
 KNOW FOR EXAMPLE THE SIKH 
AWARENESS APPRECIATION MONTH WAS

[Captioner] 21:40:05
 
ACTUALLY, BEGAN FROM SENATOR 
WIECKOWSKI, I

[Captioner] 21:40:09
 THINK HE IN JUNE 
OF 2012 PASSED

[Captioner] 21:40:12
 A RESOLUTION 97 
THAT DECLARES NOVEMBER AS

[Captioner] 21:40:15
 SIKH 
AWARENESS MONTH THROUGH STATE SO 
WE'RE TRYING TO

[Captioner] 21:40:18
 KEEP CONSISTENT 
WITH THE STATE IN TERMS OF WHEN 
THEY

[Captioner] 21:40:21
 HONOR SIKH AWARENESS AND 
PREECIALTION MONTH.

[Captioner] 21:40:29
 
APPRECIATION MONTH.
FOR SOME OF THE

[Captioner] 21:40:33
 CALENDAR 
HOLIDAYS THEY ARE LUNAR RELATED 
SO WE WOULD WANT TO

[Captioner] 21:40:36
 GO WITH 
WHATEVER THAT YEAR, IT MAY BE 
VARYING

[Captioner] 21:40:39
 FROM MONTH TO MONTH 
BECAUSE THERE IS A WIDE RANGE.
I KNOW THAT I

[Captioner] 21:40:42
 WANTED TO THANK I 
KNOW

[Captioner] 21:40:45
 ASSEMBLY MEMBER LOWE JUST 
ADDED

[Captioner] 21:40:49
 LUNAR NEW YEAR, THAT'S

[Captioner] 21:40:53
 
SOMETHING VARIES FROM YEAR TO 
YEAR THAT IS LUNAR

[Captioner] 21:40:56
 CALENDAR 
VERSUS THE OTHER CALENDAR.
WE MAY WANT TO TAKE

[Captioner] 21:40:59
 THAT LIST 
AND BE ABLE TO CHANGE,

[Captioner] 21:41:02
 SEND IT 
IN WRITING TO OUR -- WE CAN PASS 
THAT AROUND FOR

[Captioner] 21:41:06
 REVIEW.
I DON'T KNOW IF THERE IS A BEST 
PROCESS FOR THAT BUT

[Captioner] 21:41:09
 I THINK 
THERE'S QUITE A FEW DAYS.
I KNOW THE

[Captioner] 21:41:12
 CALIFORNIA SHAKE OUT, 
SOMETHING THAT OUR FIREFIGHTERS 
WORK

[Captioner] 21:41:16
 ON IN CONJUNCTION 
WITHFUL --
>> Councilmember Cox:   THAT IS

[Captioner] 21:41:19
 
THE EARTHQUAKE READINESS THAT I 
MENTIONED.

[Captioner] 21:41:21

>> Mayor Mei:   CALIFORNIA 
SHAKEOUT.


[Captioner] 21:41:25
>> Councilmember Cox:   WE COULD 
TAKE A LOOK AND MAKE SURE IT'S

[Captioner] 21:41:28
 
ALL MAPPED OUT CORRECTLY.
YES, I JUST CELEBRATE

[Captioner] 21:41:31
ED LUNAR NEW 
YEAR AND MOON JUST RECENTLY.
AND I

[Captioner] 21:41:34
 THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT 
WE JUST HAVE IT ON THE CALENDAR 
BUT

[Captioner] 21:41:37
 JUST MAKE SURE WE DOUBLE 
CHECK WHEN THAT OCCURS.
SO

[Captioner] 21:41:40
 WE'RE IN ACCEPTANCE OF 
RESPECTING THE

[Captioner] 21:41:44
 CULTURE AND 
RESPECTING THE PROPER

[Captioner] 21:41:47
 OBSERVANCE 
SO THAT WE FEEL THAT EVERYONE 
WILL

[Captioner] 21:41:50
 BE INCLUDED IN THAT 
PROCESS.

[Captioner] 21:41:53

>> THROUGH THE MAYOR MAY I ADD A 
COMMENT.


[Captioner] 21:41:56
>> Mayor Mei:   YES THANK YOU.
>> OBSERVATION TO RESPOND TO

[Captioner] 21:41:59
 
YOUR PROCEDURAL QUESTIONS.
NUMBER 1 I WANTED TO CONFIRM

[Captioner] 21:42:03
 
THAT APPENDIX D IN EACH OF THE 
SUBSECTIONS FOR TYPES OF

[Captioner] 21:42:06
 
CEREMONIAL DOCUMENTS WHETHER 
THEY BE PROCLAMATIONS OR 


[Captioner] 21:42:09
RECOGNITIONS, IT DOES SPECIFY 
HOW

[Captioner] 21:42:13
 THAT PROCLAMATION OR

[Captioner] 21:42:18
 
CERTIFICATE MUST BE ISSUED IN 
CONNECTION WITH THE COMMUNITY OR

[Captioner] 21:42:19
 
THE CITY OF FREMONT 
SPECIFICALLY.


[Captioner] 21:42:22
SO THERE IS EXISTING LANGUAGE 
THAT ADDRESSES YOUR CONCERN AND 
I

[Captioner] 21:42:25
 JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT 
COUNCILMEMBER COX IS AWARE OF 
THAT,

[Captioner] 21:42:28
 THAT THOSE PROTECTIONS DO 
EXIST IN THERE.
ALSO

[Captioner] 21:42:32
, THE RESOLUTION THAT IS IN 
TONIGHT

[Captioner] 21:42:36
'S COUNCIL PACKET IS A 
REFLECTION OF SOME

[Captioner] 21:42:40
 OF THE EVENTS 
THAT THE COUNCIL APPROVED LAST 
YEAR.

[Captioner] 21:42:44

SO IT'S NOT INTENDED TO BE  
EXHAUSTIVE

[Captioner] 21:42:45
.
LIKE THIS IS THE COUNCIL'S 
DOCUMENT.


[Captioner] 21:42:49
CAN YOU ADD OR REMOVE AS YOU 
DEEM FIT.
THAT CAN

[Captioner] 21:42:52
 HAPPEN THIS EVENING AS 
PART OF A MOTION.
CAN YOU ADD LANGUAGE

[Captioner] 21:42:55
YOU CAN ADD LANGUAGE

[Captioner] 21:42:58
 TO THE 
MOTION OR AS THE MAYOR INDICATED 
THAT CAN HAPPEN AT A LATER TIME

[Captioner] 21:43:02
.
NOTHING HERE PRECLUDES THE CITY 
COUNCIL FROM ADOPT

[Captioner] 21:43:05
ING ADDITIONAL 
RESOLUTIONS, EXCUSE ME STISKTS

[Captioner] 21:43:09
 
CERTIFICATES OR RESOLUTIONS EVEN 
THOUGH THEY ARE NOT INCLUDED

[Captioner] 21:43:12
 ON 
THE RESOLUTION

[Captioner] 21:43:16
 ITSELF.
>> Councilmember Cox:   I THINK 
IT'S IMPORTANT

[Captioner] 21:43:19
 THAT AS WE'RE 
TALKING ABOUT IT WE CAPTURE 
SMUMPTS WE CAN

[Captioner] 21:43:22
.
I KNOW THERE ARE INSTANCES THAT 
COME UP THAT

[Captioner] 21:43:25
 GET INSTITUTED FOR 
OUR FEDERAL OR STATESIDE THAT 
WILL

[Captioner] 21:43:29
 BE THINGS THAT WILL BE THE 
ONE-OFFS BUT AT

[Captioner] 21:43:32
 LEAST WE CAN 
HAVE CLOSE TO, YOU KNOW, 95

[Captioner] 21:43:36
% 
CAPTURED AND MAKING SURE THAT 
EVERYONE KNOWS THAT WE

[Captioner] 21:43:39
 WANT 
EVERYONE TO BE WELCOMED HERE IN 
FREMONT A CITY OF

[Captioner] 21:43:42
 COMPASSION.
>> Mayor Mei:   YES, ONE OF THE 
THINGS WE

[Captioner] 21:43:45
 ARE VERY FORTUNATE WE 
HAVE INCREDIBLE

[Captioner] 21:43:50
 DIVERSITY OF 
LANGUAGE AND HERITAGES.
SOMETIMES THE CITY

[Captioner] 21:43:53
 MAKES A 
STRUGGLE TO MAKE THE LOCATIONS 
BUT I HAVE A

[Captioner] 21:43:56
 CAVEAT THAT WE HAVE 
MANY PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN FREMONT 
BUT

[Captioner] 21:44:00
 ALSO WORSHIP ELSEWHERE AND 
PERFORM ELSEWHERE BECAUSE WE

[Captioner] 21:44:02
 
DON'T HAVE A PERFORMING ARTS 
CENTER TOO.


[Captioner] 21:44:06
SO THEREFORE SOMETIMES THESE 
REACH OUT TO OTHER CITIES NOT 
BECAUSE

[Captioner] 21:44:09
 THEY AREN'T OUR 
RESIDENTS BUT BECAUSE THEY DON'T 
HAVE THE FAITH

[Captioner] 21:44:12
, THE WORSHIP, 
FACILITIES THAT ARE HERE,

[Captioner] 21:44:15
 AND 
THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO BE AT 
LEAST INCLUDED

[Captioner] 21:44:19
, ESPECIALLY IF 
THEY'RE RESIDENT OF FREEMONTS 
WHO

[Captioner] 21:44:25
 RESIDENTS OF FREMONT 
THAT WORK ON FOOD DONATIONS

[Captioner] 21:44:28
 AND 
OTHER THINGS WE WORK ON SO I 
WANT TO MAKE

[Captioner] 21:44:32
 SURE I INCLUDE 
THAT.
ARE THERE ANY -- I JUST WANT

[Captioner] 21:44:34
 TO 
CHECK IF THERE ARE DESTINY 
QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME FROM 


[Captioner] 21:44:38
COUNCILMEMBERS, QUESTIONS FROM 
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN.
DO YOU HAVE A QUESTION BECAUSE

[Captioner] 21:44:41
 
OTHERWISE I ALSO WANTED TO 
INCLUDE THE PUBLIC BEFORE I 


[Captioner] 21:44:44
CONTINUE.
>> Councilmember Kassan:   I 
DON'T KNOW IF IT'S A QUESTION 


[Captioner] 21:44:47
BUT I THINK I CAUGHT A COUPLE OF 
ERRORS.
SO MAYBE IT IS A

[Captioner] 21:44:50
 QUESTION TO 
DOUBLE

[Captioner] 21:44:54
 CHECK WHETHER THESE ARE 
ERRORS.
ON PAGE 3 TOWARDS THE

[Captioner] 21:44:57
 BOTTOM IN 
H IT SAYS SHALL

[Captioner] 21:45:00
 GIVE ORDERS TO 
SUBORDINATES

[Captioner] 21:45:04
 OF THE CITY 
MANAGER, WE SHOULD ADD THE CITY 
ATTORNEY

[Captioner] 21:45:07
.
AND THEN THE OTHER

[Captioner] 21:45:11
 ONE WAS ON 
PAGE 10, AND I

[Captioner] 21:45:14
 THINK I POINTED 
THIS OUT BEFORE, AND

[Captioner] 21:45:17
 IT SEEMS 
LIKE AN ERROR TO ME BECAUSE IT

[Captioner] 21:45:21
 
SAYS, ONE SECOND, IT

[Captioner] 21:45:24
 SAYS UNDER 
3

[Captioner] 21:45:27
A PUBLIC COMMUNICATIONS IT SAYS

[Captioner] 21:45:30

SAYS, "WRITTEN SUBJECT TO THE 
TIME LIMITS DESCRIBED IN THIS

[Captioner] 21:45:33
 
DOCUMENT ANY MEMBER OF THE 
PUBLIC OR THEIR

[Captioner] 21:45:37
 AUTHORIZED 
REPRESENTATIVE MAY ADDRESS THE 
CITY COUNCIL

[Captioner] 21:45:40
 BY WRITTEN 
COMMUNICATIONS.
IT SEEMS LIKE THE

[Captioner] 21:45:43
 SUBJECT TO THE 
TIME LIMITS SHOULD BE REMOVED 
BECAUSE THERE'S NO

[Captioner] 21:45:46
 TIME LIMITS 
ON WRITTEN COMMUNICATION.
THANK YOU

[Captioner] 21:45:51
.

[Captioner] 21:45:56

>> Mayor Mei:   RAFAEL WOULD YOU 
LIKE TO COMMENT ON THAT?


[Captioner] 21:46:00
>> SURE.
WITH RESPECT TO THE COMMENT FOR 
CHAPTER

[Captioner] 21:46:04
 1 SUB H

[Captioner] 21:46:07
 I THINK IT'S I 
THINK BEST TO

[Captioner] 21:46:10
 LEAVE IT AS IS NOW 
BECAUSE I THINK IT ACTUALLY

[Captioner] 21:46:14
 
REFLECTS CURRENT OPERATIONS IN 
TERMS OF HOW THE CITY MANAGER

[Captioner] 21:46:16
 
SERVES AS THE PERSONNEL OFFICER 
FOR CITY.


[Captioner] 21:46:19
SO I THINK THERE'S SOME BENEFIT

[Captioner] 21:46:22
 
TO LEAVING IT THE WAY THAT IT IS 
TO REFLECT

[Captioner] 21:46:26
 THAT MUNICIPAL CODE 
PROVISION THAT GOVERNS

[Captioner] 21:46:29
 THAT 
ISSUE.
>> Councilmember Kassan:   ARE 


[Captioner] 21:46:33
YOU SURE?
BECAUSE DO YOU WANT 
COUNCILMEMBERS TO GIVE ORDERS

[Captioner] 21:46:36
 TO 
SUBORDINATES OF THE CITY 
ATTORNEY

[Captioner] 21:46:39
?
>> I UNDERSTAND THE QUESTION BUT 
ACTUALLY TECHNICALLY, SINCE

[Captioner] 21:46:42
 THE 
CITY MANAGER SERVES AS THE 
PERSONNEL OFFICER FOR

[Captioner] 21:46:45
 ALL 
EMPLOYEES OF THE CITY OTHER THAN 
THE CITY ATTORNEY

[Captioner] 21:46:49
 ITSELF WHO IS 
A COUNCIL APPOINTEE UNDER

[Captioner] 21:46:52
 THE 
RULES YOU'D ACTUALLY NEED TO GO 
THROUGH CITY MANAGER BEFORE

[Captioner] 21:46:54
 YOU 
SPEAK TO ONE OF THE STAFF 
ATTORNEYS.


[Captioner] 21:46:58
AS AN EXAMPLE, IT IS A UNIQUE 
RULE IN FREMONT

[Captioner] 21:47:01
 BUT ACKNOWLEDGE 
THAT IS THE WAY IT WORKS HERE.
>> Councilmember Kassan:   OKAY

[Captioner] 21:47:04
, 
BUT IT SEEMS TO BE SAYING WE 
COULD

[Captioner] 21:47:07
 GIVE ORDERS TO YOUR 
SUBORDINATES WHICH I ASSUME

[Captioner] 21:47:10
 WE 
WOULDN'T WANT BUT I'M FINE WITH 
KEEPING IT

[Captioner] 21:47:14
 IF YOU DO THINK IT'S 
FINE.
>> I DO THINK IT'S OKAY

[Captioner] 21:47:17
 BECAUSE 
IT'S IN LINE OF WHAT THE 
MUNICIPAL CODE

[Captioner] 21:47:20
 REQUIRES OF THE 
CITY MANAGER'S OFFICE.
IN TERMS

[Captioner] 21:47:23
 OF THE SECOND COMMENT I 
DON'T THINK I COMPLETELY 
CAPTURED

[Captioner] 21:47:26
 IT.
CAN YOU WALK ME THROUGH THAT ONE

[Captioner] 21:47:29
 
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN?
>> Councilmember Kassan:   SO ON 


[Captioner] 21:47:32
PAGE 10 UNDER 3

[Captioner] 21:47:35
A, IT REFERS TO 
TIME LIMITS.
BUT

[Captioner] 21:47:38
 I'M NOT SURE WHY THERE WOULD 
BE TIME

[Captioner] 21:47:41
 LIMITS RELATED TO 
WRITTEN COMMUNICATION.


[Captioner] 21:47:45
>> I BELIEVE THE CITY ATTORNEY 
CAN CORRECT ME WHILE

[Captioner] 21:47:48
 HE'S 
REVIEWING BUT I BELIEVE IT 
REFERS TO FOR

[Captioner] 21:47:51
 THOSE COMMENTS TO 
BE PUBLISHED AS PART OF THE 
RECORD

[Captioner] 21:47:54
 AHEAD OF A PUBLIC 
MEETING.
THIS IS A SECTION REFERRING TO

[Captioner] 21:47:57
 
PUBLIC MEETINGS.
WE DO HAVE A TIME LIMIT BY WHICH 


[Captioner] 21:48:01
WE NEED THOSE RECEIVED.
I BELIEVE THIS IS WHAT

[Captioner] 21:48:04
 THIS IS 
REFER TO SO THAT IS WHAT THE 
TIME LIMIT IS.

[Captioner] 21:48:07

>> Councilmember Kassan:   OKAY, 
AND WHERE IS THAT TIME LIMIT 


[Captioner] 21:48:10
REFERENCED?


[Captioner] 21:48:19
>> I BELIEVE IT IS ON THE COVER 
PAGE OF THE AGENDA.

[Captioner] 21:48:21

>> Councilmember Kassan:   IT IS 
NOT IMPORTANT.


[Captioner] 21:48:24
IT IS OBVIOUSLY A MINOR ISSUE.
I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING

[Captioner] 21:48:27
 ABOUT TIME 
LIMITS RELATED TO WRITTEN 
COMMUNICATIONS BUT IT'S

[Captioner] 21:48:28
 NOT 
IMPORTANT.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 21:48:35
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.
NEXT IS COUNCILMEMBER SHAO,

[Captioner] 21:48:39
 
CLARIFYING QUESTIONS.
>> Councilmember Shao:   THANK 


[Captioner] 21:48:42
YOU MADAM MAYOR.
FIRST OF ALL,

[Captioner] 21:48:45
 MANY THANKS TO 
COUNCILMEMBER COX FOR PROVIDING 
SUCH

[Captioner] 21:48:49
 A COMPREHENSIVE LIST

[Captioner] 21:48:53
 OF 
IMPORTANT DAYS TO OBSERVE.

[Captioner] 21:48:56

AND EVEN INCLUDING MONTH FOR

[Captioner] 21:48:59
 THE 
PAT, IF I'M NOT WRONG.
>> Councilmember Cox:   UH-HUH

[Captioner] 21:49:04
.
>> Councilmember Shao:   BUT

[Captioner] 21:49:07
 YOU 
CLAIM IT COVERED 90% OF

[Captioner] 21:49:10
 THE 
FORTUNATE DAYS, BUT I'M WAITING 
FOR ONE IMPORTANT

[Captioner] 21:49:13
 DAY COMING UP 
WHICH IS SUNDAY.
CALIFORNIA

[Captioner] 21:49:16
 STARTED CELEBRATING 
CHINESE AMERICAN DAY OCTOBER

[Captioner] 21:49:19
 
23rd WHICH IS THE COMING 
SUNDAY.

[Captioner] 21:49:23

SINCE 2019.
AND SO THAT CERTAINLY

[Captioner] 21:49:26
 IS, TO ME, 
AN IMPORTANT DAY.

[Captioner] 21:49:30

BUT THAT'S NOT MY POINT.
MY POINT IS THAT

[Captioner] 21:49:33
 IF WE KEEP 
ADDING ALL THE

[Captioner] 21:49:36
 DAYS, ONTO THE 
LIST

[Captioner] 21:49:39
, IMAGINING THAT NOBODY 
WOULD EVER JUST STOP

[Captioner] 21:49:43
, YOU KNOW, 
CELEBRATING A DAY, BUT MORE DAYS 
WILL

[Captioner] 21:49:46
 BE GENERATED AND THE

[Captioner] 21:49:49
 LIST 
WILL GET LONGER AND LONGER AND 
THE

[Captioner] 21:49:52
 WEEKLY CITY COUNCIL MEETING 
FOR THE

[Captioner] 21:49:57
 CEREMONIAL, IT WILL

[Captioner] 21:50:00
 BE 
PRETTY MUCH OCCUPYING MORE THAN 
HALF OF THE

[Captioner] 21:50:03
 AGENDA ITEMS.
AND SO IN LIGHT

[Captioner] 21:50:07
 OF STREAMLINING 
THE MEETING, MY

[Captioner] 21:50:10
 QUESTION IS, CAN 
WE INSTEAD OF

[Captioner] 21:50:14
 JUST REPEATING 
ISSUING THE SAME

[Captioner] 21:50:18
 LANGUAGE, 
CERTIFICATE YEAR AFTER YEAR, FOR 
CERTAIN

[Captioner] 21:50:21
 ONES WE CAN JUST HAVE A 
COMBINED LIKE

[Captioner] 21:50:25
 STATEMENT TO SAY, 
FOR THE MONTH OF MAY

[Captioner] 21:50:29
 WE, YOU 
KNOW, CELEBRATE CERTAIN DAY

[Captioner] 21:50:34
, WE 
CAN HAVE THE CERTIFICATE READY,

[Captioner] 21:50:37
 
FOR CERTAIN ORGANIZATIONS,

[Captioner] 21:50:40
 BUT 
JUST SO WE JUST DON'T HAVE TO GO

[Captioner] 21:50:43
 
ITEM BY ITEM FOR THAT

[Captioner] 21:50:46
 CEREMONIAL 
SO THAT IT SAVES A LOT

[Captioner] 21:50:50
 OF 
TAXPAYERS TIME.
IF

[Captioner] 21:50:53
 THEY REALLY WANT TO ATTEND 
THE MEETING AND THEN

[Captioner] 21:50:56
 TRY TO 
CONTRIBUTE TO THE MEETING.

[Captioner] 21:50:59

THAT WOULD MAKE THE MEETING MORE 
EFFICIENT.

[Captioner] 21:51:02

MY QUESTION IS, IS

[Captioner] 21:51:06
 THAT 
POSSIBLE?
>> Mayor Mei:   WELL I KNOW THAT

[Captioner] 21:51:09
 
I JUST WANTED TO COMMENT IN 
GENERAL.


[Captioner] 21:51:12
SOMETIMES IN THE PAST WE 
PRESENTED THE CERTIFICATES

[Captioner] 21:51:15
 AT 
THE EVENTS THAT PERTAIN TO THE 
ORGANIZATIONS.


[Captioner] 21:51:18
BECAUSE THE COUNCIL MEETING IS 
NOT, I MEAN WE'VE

[Captioner] 21:51:21
 HAD 
DISCUSSIONS IN THE PAST WE'VE 
HAD MANY THINGS IN THE PAST

[Captioner] 21:51:24
 WHEN 
FOR EXAMPLE WE'VE HAD FLAG 
RAISINGS,

[Captioner] 21:51:27
 WE'VE HAD ALSO 
CHILDREN COME AND SING.
BUT

[Captioner] 21:51:30
 WE ARE ALSO TRYING TO MAKE 
SURE THAT WE ARE RESPECTFUL

[Captioner] 21:51:34
 OF 
THE PUBLIC'S TIME AND ALSO 
IMPORTANTLY OUR STAFF'S TIME TOO

[Captioner] 21:51:36

TOO.
FOR AGENDA IDEAS THAT ARE COMING 


[Captioner] 21:51:39
BEFORE US.
SO I DON'T KNOW PERHAPS THAT'S 
SOMETHING WE'LL HAVE TO

[Captioner] 21:51:42
 TAKE UP 
AT THE COUNCIL RETREAT NEXT YEAR 
IN TERMS

[Captioner] 21:51:45
 OF HOW DO WE BALANCE 
IT?
BECAUSE IT MIGHT NOT BE

[Captioner] 21:51:49
 THE BEST 
USE IN TERMS IF

[Captioner] 21:51:52
 OF IF IT EXCEEDS

[Captioner] 21:51:55
, 
LET'S SAY THE FIRST WEEK IS THIS 
TYPE OF DAY, THE

[Captioner] 21:51:58
 SECOND IS THE 
PROCLAMATIONS OR THEY'LL LIMIT 
IT TO

[Captioner] 21:52:01
 CERTAIN, AT CERTAIN TIMES 
OF THE MONTH.
RATHER THAN THROUGHOUT

[Captioner] 21:52:05
 THE 
ENTIRE MONTH.
SO THAT MIGHT BE SOMETHING I

[Captioner] 21:52:08
 
APPRECIATE COUNCILMEMBER SHAO'S 
QUESTION SO I DON'T KNOW IF 


[Captioner] 21:52:11
THAT'S SOMETHING WE RESEARCHED.
>> ONE THING I DO WANT TO 
CLARIFY IS

[Captioner] 21:52:15
 THAT THIS RESOLUTION 
DOESN'T IMPOSE ANY ADDITIONAL 
REQUIREMENTS.

[Captioner] 21:52:18

SO FOR EXAMPLE EVEN IF YOU WERE 
TO APPROVE THIS RESOLUTION

[Captioner] 21:52:22
 THIS 
EVENING THERE IS NO REQUIREMENT 
THAT YOU TAKE TIME

[Captioner] 21:52:25
 AT THE CITY 
COUNCIL MEETINGS TO MAKE THOSE

[Captioner] 21:52:28
 
PRESENTATIONS, THOSE 
PRESENTATION

[Captioner] 21:52:31
S COULD BE MADE AT 
EVENTS LET'S SAY.

[Captioner] 21:52:35

IN THE SENSE THAT IT DOESN'T 
HAVE TO BE REQUESTED, THE MAYOR

[Captioner] 21:52:38
 
COULD SIMPLY ISSUE THEM BASED ON 
THIS APPROVED

[Captioner] 21:52:42
 LIST AND 
INDIVIDUAL COUNCILMEMBERS OR 
PEOPLE FROM THE

[Captioner] 21:52:45
 PUBLIC WOULD NOT 
HAVE TO PRESENTLY TWO WEEKS

[Captioner] 21:52:48
 IN 
ADVANCE.
IT IS MEANT TO CREATE

[Captioner] 21:52:50
 
ADMINISTRATIVE EFFICIENCIES AND 
NOT TO CREATE ANY NEW 


[Captioner] 21:52:54
RESTRICTIONS AND THE LIST IS 
YOUR LIST.
SO WE CAN ADD

[Captioner] 21:52:58
 OR DEDUCT AS THIS

[Captioner] 21:53:01
 
COUNCIL DEEMS FIT.
>> Mayor Mei:   NEXT

[Captioner] 21:53:04
 IS 
COUNCILMEMBER JONES.
FOR CLARIFYING QUESTIONS.

[Captioner] 21:53:06

>> Councilmember Jones:   THANK 
YOU MADAM MAYOR.


[Captioner] 21:53:09
ACTUALLY COUNCILMEMBER SHAO AND 
CITY ATTORNEY ALVARADO

[Captioner] 21:53:13
 JUST KIND 
OF CLARIFIED MOST OF WHAT I HAD 
IN MIND AND

[Captioner] 21:53:16
 THAT WAS, YOU KNOW,

[Captioner] 21:53:18
 
WE DO THESE RECOGNITIONS EVERY 
YEAR.


[Captioner] 21:53:21
IF WE DID A RESOLUTION FOR EVERY 
ITEM

[Captioner] 21:53:25
, FOR INSTANCE IN THE MONTH 
OF NOVEMBER, YOU'RE

[Captioner] 21:53:28
 LOOKING AT, 
YOU KNOW, AT LEAST AN HOUR OF 
TIME THAT

[Captioner] 21:53:31
 WE'RE SPENDING ON 
RESOLUTIONS RATHER THAN ACTUALLY 
TAKING CARE OF CITY

[Captioner] 21:53:34
 BUSINESS.
AND I UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE 
OF RECOGNIZING ALL OF

[Captioner] 21:53:37
 THESE DAYS 
AND ALL OF THESE ORGANIZATIONS 
AND ALL

[Captioner] 21:53:41
 OF THESE GROUPS.
BUT I'M WONDERING IF

[Captioner] 21:53:43
 THERE'S A 
MORE EFFICIENT WAY TO DO THAT AS 
OPPOSED

[Captioner] 21:53:47
 TO READING INDIVIDUAL 
RESOLUTIONS FOR EACH AND EVERY

[Captioner] 21:53:50
 
ITEM AS WE GO THROUGH THE MONTH.
I'VE HEARD A LOT

[Captioner] 21:53:54
 OF COMMENTS 
FROM MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC 
ABOUT, YOU KNOW, I SPENT THE

[Captioner] 21:53:57
 
FIRST HALF OF MY MEETING 
LISTENING TO RESOLUTIONS

[Captioner] 21:54:00
 BE READ 
AND PEOPLE BEING THANKED FOR 
BRINGING THOSE

[Captioner] 21:54:03
 RESOLUTIONS 
FORWARD.
YOU KNOW, WHEN WERE YOU GOING TO

[Captioner] 21:54:06
 
GET DOWN TO BUSINESS.
SO I THINK

[Captioner] 21:54:09
 THERE MAY BE A WAY OF 
STREAMLINING THIS

[Captioner] 21:54:13
, AND TO 
MS. BRIGGS POINT,

[Captioner] 21:54:16
 THERE MAY BE 
SOMETHING THAT COMES UP IN THE

[Captioner] 21:54:19
 
COUNCIL RETREAT.
SO I WON'T BE THERE FOR THAT.


[Captioner] 21:54:22
BUT YOU GUYS CAN HASH THAT OUT 
I'M SURE.

[Captioner] 21:54:25

BUT I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT 
IT HAS BROUGHT A LOT

[Captioner] 21:54:28
 OF 
ATTENTION, AND IT HAS CONCERNED

[Captioner] 21:54:31
 
THE PUBLIC ABOUT THE

[Captioner] 21:54:35
 INORDINATE 
AMOUNT OF TIME THAT IS SPENT ON

[Captioner] 21:54:38
 
CEREMONIAL ITEMS RATHER THAN THE 
ACTUAL TAKING CARE OF

[Captioner] 21:54:41
 CITY 
BUSINESS.
>> Mayor Mei:   SO JUST

[Captioner] 21:54:44
 TO LET 
YOU KNOW TO SHARE A LITTLE BIT 
OF INSIGHT I KNOW ON

[Captioner] 21:54:47
 THE SCHOOL 
DISTRICT SIDE AT ONE POINT

[Captioner] 21:54:50
 WE 
WERE DOING A NUMBER OF DAYS BUT 
WE ADOPTED THE

[Captioner] 21:54:54
 CALIFORNIA 
DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION DAYS.
SO THAT WAY IT WOULDN'T

[Captioner] 21:54:57
 BE 
INDIVIDUALLY.
IT'S NOT THAT WE DON'T RESPECT, 


[Captioner] 21:55:00
WE WANT TO BE MORE CONCLUSIVE 
NOT LESS.
WE

[Captioner] 21:55:03
 ADOPTED THE ENTIRE CALIFORNIA 
DEPARTMENT OF 

[Captioner] 21:55:07
EDUCATION 
DOCUMENT, IT WAS A 20 PAGE 
DOCUMENT AND

[Captioner] 21:55:10
 THAT MADE IT EASIER 
FOR US.
THAT

[Captioner] 21:55:13
 WAS ADDED ON TO THE 
CALENDAR SO EVERYONE COULD SEE

[Captioner] 21:55:16
 
IT.
I THINK THAT COUNCILMEMBER 


[Captioner] 21:55:19
SALWAN, CLARIFYING QUESTIONS AND 
WE STILL WANT THE

[Captioner] 21:55:22
 PUBLIC TO 
COMMENT ON THIS.
>> Councilmember Salwan:  

[Captioner] 21:55:25
 NO 
COMMENT JUST NEED TO MAKE A 
MOTION

[Captioner] 21:55:29
 WHEN WE ARE READY.
>> Mayor Mei:   WE HAVE

[Captioner] 21:55:33
 THE 
PUBLIC AND THEN I HAVE A COUPLE 
OF COMMENTS NOW

[Captioner] 21:55:37
.
>> The Clerk:   WE HAVE A 
COUPLE, CHRIS, SORRY

[Captioner] 21:55:40
, CHRIS 
LOWERED HIS HAND.

[Captioner] 21:55:45

VENITA VERMA.

[Captioner] 21:55:47

>> THANK YOU COUNCILMEMBERS AND 
MADAM MAYOR.


[Captioner] 21:55:50
I JUST HAVE A VERY SIMPLE 
CONCERN.
THAT I

[Captioner] 21:55:53
 DO RESPECT THE DIVERSITY 
WE HAVE

[Captioner] 21:55:57
 IN FREMONT.
I LOVE TO STAY IN FREMONT.
I HAVE BEEN IN FREMONT

[Captioner] 21:56:00
 FOR A 
VERY LONG TIME.
THIS IS THE LONGEST I'VE STAYED

[Captioner] 21:56:03
 
IN ONE PLACE

[Captioner] 21:56:06
.
I LOVE ALL THE CULTURES AND 
RELIGIONS THAT WE

[Captioner] 21:56:10
 HAVE AND I 
RESPECT THEM TOO.
HOWEVER

[Captioner] 21:56:13
, I THINK IT WILL BE 
REALLY BENEFICIAL

[Captioner] 21:56:16
 FOR EVERYBODY 
IN THIS COMMUNITY TO

[Captioner] 21:56:19
 JUST HAVE 
COUPLE OF DAYS LIKE ONE

[Captioner] 21:56:22
 
INTERNATIONAL DAY WHICH IS --

[Captioner] 21:56:26
 
WHICH HONORS EACH AND EVERY 
PERSON FROM ALL

[Captioner] 21:56:29
 THE PEOPLE FROM 
ALL THE COUNTRIES.
AND THEN MAYBE ANOTHER

[Captioner] 21:56:32
 ONE WHICH 
IS INTERNATIONAL FAITH,

[Captioner] 21:56:34
 
INTERFAITH DAY OR SOMETHING LIKE 
THAT.


[Captioner] 21:56:38
WHICH WILL AGAIN HONOR ALL THE 
FAITHS,

[Captioner] 21:56:42
 INSTEAD OF HONORING ONE 
FAITH OVER THE OTHER.
YOU

[Captioner] 21:56:45
 CAN HAVE THE CERTIFICATES 
AND ALL THOSE

[Captioner] 21:56:48
 THINGS.
THOSE ARE UP TO YOU GUYS BUT I 
THINK

[Captioner] 21:56:52
 THAT IT WILL BE WELL TAKEN 
AND IT WILL BE MORE RESPECT

[Captioner] 21:56:55
FUL 
TO THE COMMUNITY MEMBERS WHO 
WILL BE LISTENING TO THE

[Captioner] 21:56:58
 
MEETINGS WHO COME TO THE 
MEETINGS ALL THE TIME AND ALSO 


[Captioner] 21:57:01
TO THE STAFF MEMBERS.
AND IN ADDITION TO THAT

[Captioner] 21:57:04
, IT WILL 
ALSO KEEP

[Captioner] 21:57:08
 YOU AWAY FROM HURTING

[Captioner] 21:57:12
 
EMOTIONS OF THOSE WHO ARE NOT 
QUOTE UNQUOTE GETTING

[Captioner] 21:57:15
 HONORED IN 
THESE PROCLAMATIONS

[Captioner] 21:57:18
.
THERE ARE SOME ORGANIZATIONS 
THAT I DON'T

[Captioner] 21:57:21
 FAVOR THAT ARE 
GETTING HONORED

[Captioner] 21:57:25
 BY OUR CITY BUT 
THAT'S A DIFFERENT STORY

[Captioner] 21:57:29
.
IF

[Captioner] 21:57:32
 WE RESPECT ONE WE NEED TO 
RESPECT ALL.
AND INSTEAD OF

[Captioner] 21:57:36
 HAVING INDIVIDUAL 
RELIGIONS BEING HONORED

[Captioner] 21:57:38
 INSTEAD 
OF BEING -- INSTEAD OF 
INDIVIDUAL COUNTRY,

[Captioner] 21:57:42
 PEOPLE 
GETTING HONORED LET'S JUST HONOR 
EVERYBODY ON

[Captioner] 21:57:45
 ONE OR TWO DAYS.
THANK YOU

[Captioner] 21:57:48
.
>> The Clerk:   THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 21:57:51

IS THAT --
>> The Clerk:   CHRIS.


[Captioner] 21:57:59
>> THANKS, THE UNMUTE POPPED UP 
THIS TIME, LAST TIME

[Captioner] 21:58:02
 IT DIDN'T.
SO I HOPE I'M SPEAKING ON THE 
CORRECT

[Captioner] 21:58:05
 TOPIC.
BUT CHANGES

[Captioner] 21:58:08
 TO THE CITY COUNCIL,

[Captioner] 21:58:11
 
SO THE

[Captioner] 21:58:15
 COUNCIL, THE CHANGE 
MENTIONED

[Captioner] 21:58:18
 BY COUNCILMEMBER -- 
ONE

[Captioner] 21:58:22
 OF THE COUNCILMEMBERS, I 
WON'T SAY HER NAME CORRECTLY

[Captioner] 21:58:25
.
NOTED THAT WRITTEN

[Captioner] 21:58:28
 COMMUNICATION 
HAD AN ISSUE AND I BELIEVE THAT 
WAS BROUGHT UP A

[Captioner] 21:58:31
 YEAR AGO ON OUR 
MEETING.
AND I WAS

[Captioner] 21:58:34
 ONE OF THE PEOPLE THAT 
BROUGHT IT UP AND IT WAS TAKEN 
AS

[Captioner] 21:58:38
 A MEETING NOTE THAT THAT 
WOULD BE CHANGED.
SO I'M CONCERNED

[Captioner] 21:58:41
 ABOUT WHETHER 
OR NOT AT A CITY COUNCIL

[Captioner] 21:58:44
 
MEETING, SOMETHING CHANGED IN 
THE LAW BEFORE

[Captioner] 21:58:47
 IT'S ADDRESSED 
WHETHER OR NOT IT IS.
THE OTHER THING IS

[Captioner] 21:58:51
, SOMETIMES I 
HEAR CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS SAYING 
THEY CAN'T

[Captioner] 21:58:54
 ANSWER QUESTIONS.
BUT I'M NOT SEEING THAT IN THE 
RULES HERE

[Captioner] 21:58:58
.
AND THE OTHER THING IS, I SEE 
YOU

[Captioner] 21:59:02
 WANT TO MAKE CHANGES ABOUT 
PEOPLE BEING ABLE TO

[Captioner] 21:59:05
 STOP 
TALKING AT PUBLIC,

[Captioner] 21:59:08
 PUBLIC, STOP 
TALKING AT CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS

[Captioner] 21:59:12
, 
AND SO YOU'VE CHANGED SOME OF 
THE RULES AROUND THAT

[Captioner] 21:59:15
, THAT'S 
NOT VERY CLEAR AT ALL

[Captioner] 21:59:18
.
AND I THINK THIS IS

[Captioner] 21:59:21
 IN WHAT IS 
I.T.,

[Captioner] 21:59:30
 
IT, CHAPTER 4

[Captioner] 21:59:33
B.
THAT'S WHAT I'LL PUT FORTH

[Captioner] 21:59:37
.
I'D ALSO LIKE TO KNOW, WHEN CAN

[Captioner] 21:59:39
 
QUESTIONS ASKED BY THE PUBLIC BE 
ANSWERED?


[Captioner] 21:59:42
IT IS A POLICY BY THE CITY 
COUNCIL MEMBERS NOT TO ANSWER

[Captioner] 21:59:46
 
THEM BECAUSE I'M NOT SEEING THEM 
IN THE HANDBOOK HERE.


[Captioner] 21:59:49
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 21:59:53
>> The Clerk:   NEXT SPEAKER IS 
KATHERINE.
>> Mayor Mei:   WELCOME

[Captioner] 21:59:56
, 
KATHERINE.
>> THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 21:59:58

I'M GOING TO MAKE THIS REAL 
QUICK.


[Captioner] 22:00:01
I DON'T SEE ANY SENSE IN 
REPEATING SOMETHING THAT

[Captioner] 22:00:04
 HAS 
ALREADY BEEN SAID.
SO I AM GOING

[Captioner] 22:00:07
 TO SAY THAT EVERY 
POINT

[Captioner] 22:00:12
 THAT VENETA MADE WAS 100%

[Captioner] 22:00:13
 
OF SOMETHING THAT I WOULD HAVE 
SAID.


[Captioner] 22:00:16
SO I'M IN FULL AGREEMENT WITH 
HER SUGGESTIONS

[Captioner] 22:00:21
.
AND THANK YOU FOR,

[Captioner] 22:00:24
 COUNCILMEMBER 
JONES FOR BRINGING THAT UP IN 
TERMS OF STREAMLINING EVERYTHING

[Captioner] 22:00:26

EVERYTHING.
ALL RIGHT, I YIELD THE REST OF 


[Captioner] 22:00:29
MY TIME.
>> The Clerk:   THANK YOU.
THE NEXT SPEAKER

[Captioner] 22:00:34
 IS MARIE

[Captioner] 22:00:37
.
>> THIS IS MARIE HUGHES THERE 
NILES

[Captioner] 22:00:41
.
I JUST WANTED TO THANK THE 
COUNCIL AND THE

[Captioner] 22:00:44
 STAFF FOR 
LISTENING TO US ATHE THE LAST 
MEETING

[Captioner] 22:00:47
 AND REMOVING THE SECTION 
WHERE YOU WERE GOING TO

[Captioner] 22:00:50
 CHANGE 
HOW PUBLIC COMMENT ON THE 
CONSENT CALENDAR WOULD HAPPEN

[Captioner] 22:00:53
 SO 
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 22:01:00
>> Mayor Mei:   WAS THAT THE 
LAST OF OUR SPEAKERS, THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 22:01:03

SO I'M GOING TO CLOSE THE PUBLIC 
COMMENT AND I'LL BRING IT BACK.

[Captioner] 22:01:07

THERE IS A COUPLE OF 
CLAIRVETIONS, I

[Captioner] 22:01:13
 
CLARIFICATIONS.
ORIGINALLY WE HAD

[Captioner] 22:01:16
 TALKED ABOUT 
PUBLIC SPEAKERS, THAT IS 
SOMETHING WE HAD CHANGED AND I 


[Captioner] 22:01:19
THINK THE LAST SPEAKER MENTIONED 
THAT IN TERMS OF THE ONLY THING

[Captioner] 22:01:22
 
IS THAT WE HAVE THE RIGHT IF 
THINGS BECOME

[Captioner] 22:01:26
 I THINK WE'VE HAD 
SOME SITUATIONS WHERE IT BECOMES

[Captioner] 22:01:29

BECOMES, READING WHERE WE STRUCK 
OUT BECOMES BOISTEROUS

[Captioner] 22:01:33
 WHILE 
ADDRESSING.
WE'VE HAD SOME ISSUES IN THE 


[Captioner] 22:01:36
PAST WHERE PEOPLE TRIED SMASHING 
A WINDOW WHICH

[Captioner] 22:01:39
 WOULD BE 
DISRUPTIVE TO THE COUNCIL.
BUT I WAS GOING TO SAY IS

[Captioner] 22:01:43
 THERE 
ANYTHING ELSE THAT YOU WANT TO 
CLARIFY ON THAT ITEM ON PAGE

[Captioner] 22:01:46
 14, 
ITEM 3?
AND I THINK IT'S SECTION

[Captioner] 22:01:49
 4 ITEM 
B

[Captioner] 22:01:52
.
AND B-3 ON PAGE 14.
I THINK

[Captioner] 22:01:56
 THAT MAY BE THE ONE 
SOMEBODY WAS REFERENCING.


[Captioner] 22:02:02
>> WE TOOK OUT THE TERM 
BOISTEROUS SIMPLY

[Captioner] 22:02:06
 BECAUSE IT'S 
AMBIGUOUS,

[Captioner] 22:02:09
 CAN BE INTERPRETED 
MANY WAYS.
THE COUNCIL IN ITS CURRENT

[Captioner] 22:02:12
 
HANDBOOK FORM CAN -- YOU KNOW,

[Captioner] 22:02:15
 
ADDRESS DISRUPTIVE BEHAVIOR

[Captioner] 22:02:19
 AND 
THAT PROVISION REMAINS.
YOU CAN STILL

[Captioner] 22:02:22
 ADDRESS DISRUPTIVE 
BEHAVIOR IN YOUR MEETING,

[Captioner] 22:02:27
 THE 
WORD BOISTEROUS

[Captioner] 22:02:31
 CAN BE JOYFUL

[Captioner] 22:02:34
.
WE DECIDED TO

[Captioner] 22:02:38
 LEAVE DISRUPTIVE.
>> Mayor Mei:   THERE WAS A 
QUESTION EARLIER TONIGHT

[Captioner] 22:02:41
 TALKING 
ABOUT THE TWO, WHO IT REPORTS TO 
THE COUNCIL

[Captioner] 22:02:44
.
AND I BELIEVE THAT THE DIRECT 
REPORTS AND THE

[Captioner] 22:02:47
 DIRECT HIRES 
REMAIN THE CITY

[Captioner] 22:02:50
 MANAGER AND

[Captioner] 22:02:53
 THE 
CITY ATTORNEY.
AND MAY I CLARIFY AS TO HOW THAT 


[Captioner] 22:02:57
DECISION'S BEING MADE?
BECAUSE I'M NOT SURE WE HAVE THE

[Captioner] 22:03:00
 
CLARIFICATION OF THE ROLE.
>> THE CITY MANAGER AND CITY 


[Captioner] 22:03:03
ATTORNEY ARE BOTH COUNCIL 
APPOINTED

[Captioner] 22:03:06
 EXECUTIVES.
MEANING THAT IN ORDER TO HIRE

[Captioner] 22:03:09
 
THE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE SITTING

[Captioner] 22:03:12

SITTING, SERVING THOSE CHAIRS, 
THOSE TITLES, THE

[Captioner] 22:03:16
 COUNCIL 
MAJORITY HAS TO VOTE IN FAVOR OF 
THE APPOINTMENT

[Captioner] 22:03:20
.
>> Mayor Mei:   AND JUST TO 
CLARIFY IF THERE IS A

[Captioner] 22:03:24
 CHANGE IN 
THAT RELATIONSHIP OR IF THERE'S 
A DISCUSSION I KNOW

[Captioner] 22:03:27
 THAT THE 
CITY MAYOR HAS

[Captioner] 22:03:31
 ONE DECLINATION 
AS MAYOR I'M

[Captioner] 22:03:34
 PART OF THE COUNCIL 
WHICH IS THE SEVEN OF US.
BUT THERE ARE

[Captioner] 22:03:37
 SEVERAL DUTIES 
THAT ARE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT 
FOR THE MAYOR AS

[Captioner] 22:03:41
 THE 
SPOKESPERSON FOR THE COUNCIL AS 
WELL AS IN TERMS OF MAKING

[Captioner] 22:03:45
 
APPOINTMENTS.
AND THOSE ARE SELECTED

[Captioner] 22:03:48
 BY THE 
MAYOR BUT THEY HAVE TO THE 

[Captioner] 22:03:51
 TO BE 
RATIFIED AND APPROVED BY THE

[Captioner] 22:03:54
 
COUNCIL MAJORITY.
AND THEN ALSO WHIT COMES TO 


[Captioner] 22:03:57
SIGNING LETTERS OF AGREEMENT, 
THE MAYOR GENERALLY DOES THAT IN

[Captioner] 22:04:00
 
THAT CAPACITY.
BUT AGAIN, I JUST WANTED TO

[Captioner] 22:04:03
 
CLARIFY WHO LAST TO APPROVE 
THESE WHEN IT COMES

[Captioner] 22:04:06
 HAS TO APPROVE

[Captioner] 22:04:10
 THESE 
WHEN IT COMES OUT.
>> THE MAYOR DOES NOT HAVE

[Captioner] 22:04:12
 
INDEPENDENT AUTHORITY OTHER THAN 
THOSE AUTHORITIES CONFERRED IN 


[Captioner] 22:04:16
THE HANDBOOK WHICH THE HANDBOOK 
AS THAT'S THE DISCUSSION

[Captioner] 22:04:19
 THIS 
EVENING ONLY ADDRESSES 
CEREMONIAL ITEMS,

[Captioner] 22:04:22
 AND 
APPOINTMENT TO THE CITY'S 
ADVISORY BODIES.


[Captioner] 22:04:25
OTHER THAN THAT, THE COUNCIL 
VOTES AS A MAJORITY

[Captioner] 22:04:29
.
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU FOR 
THAT CLARIFICATION.


[Captioner] 22:04:32
I APPRECIATE THAT.
AND THE OTHER THING IS, OF 
COURSE,

[Captioner] 22:04:36
 AND WE'LL DECIDE IN THE 
FUTURE HOW THAT WORKS, TOO, IN 
TERMS

[Captioner] 22:04:39
 OF WE HAVE CEREMONIAL AND 
THE MAYOR IS

[Captioner] 22:04:42
 THE ONE WHO USUALLY 
DELIVERS THAT.
BUT I APPRECIATE THAT WE

[Captioner] 22:04:45
 HAVE A 
VERY ACTIVE COMMUNITY.
WE'RE ALSO JUST TRYING

[Captioner] 22:04:48
 OFIGURE 
OUT AND AS THIS MEETING RUNS A 
LITTLE LATER THIS

[Captioner] 22:04:52
 EVENING, THAT 
WE WOULD LOVE TO BE ABLE TO

[Captioner] 22:04:54
 
INCLUDE THE PUBLIC AS PART OF 
THE PROCESS BUT PART OF THE

[Captioner] 22:04:58
 
PROCESS OF WHY PEOPLE ARE COMING 
THIS EVENING IS

[Captioner] 22:05:02
 TRULY TO 
PARTICIPATE IN THE OTHER ITEMS

[Captioner] 22:05:05
 
THAT ARE CRITICAL FOR OUR 
DISCUSSION SUCH AS THE HOME

[Captioner] 22:05:07

HOMELESSNESS REPORT WHICH IS 
COMING NEXT.


[Captioner] 22:05:10
SO CAN I GET A MOTION TO ADOPT

[Captioner] 22:05:13
 
THE RESOLUTION ENTERING THE CITY 
COUNCIL HANDBOOK

[Captioner] 22:05:17
 RULES AND 
PROCEDURES AND THE

[Captioner] 22:05:20
, IT IS A 
LIVING DOCUMENT PERHAPS AND 
WE'RE STILL

[Captioner] 22:05:23
 HAVING THAT 
DISCUSSION AND THAT MAY BE 
REVISITED DURING

[Captioner] 22:05:27
 RETREAT.
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN I SAW YOU 
RAISE YOUR

[Captioner] 22:05:30
 HAND AND 
COUNCILMEMBER KENG.
SO WE HAVE A MOTION AND A

[Captioner] 22:05:33
 SECOND 
TO ADOPT A RESOLUTION AMENDING 
THE COUNCIL HANDBOOK

[Captioner] 22:05:37
, OF THE 
RULES AND PROCEDURES AND

[Captioner] 22:05:40
 ADOPT A 
PROCEDURE

[Captioner] 22:05:44
 OF THE LIST OF ANNUAL 
CEREMONIAL CELEBRATIONS

[Captioner] 22:05:46
.
WE HAVE A MOTION AND SECOND.
PLEASE VOTE.


[Captioner] 22:05:49
>> Councilmember Cox:   I HAVE A 
QUESTION.
SO BASICALLY YOU'RE

[Captioner] 22:05:52
 ACCEPTING 
WHAT IS WRITTEN, NOT ANY OTHER

[Captioner] 22:05:55
 
COMMENTS AT THIS POINT?
IS THAT WHAT WE'RE VOTING

[Captioner] 22:05:59
 ON?
>> Mayor Mei:   I THINK THE 
PROPOSAL AND I WOULD HAVE

[Captioner] 22:06:02
 TO 
GIVE IT TO THE MAKER, TO ASK 
WHAT HE'S MAKING

[Captioner] 22:06:05
 THE MOTION ON.


[Captioner] 22:06:10
>> Councilmember Salwan:   GOOD 
YES.
YES I THINK WE'RE

[Captioner] 22:06:13
 ACCEPTING 
MOVING THIS FORWARD, THIS 
RESOLUTION, AND WE'RE

[Captioner] 22:06:16
 TAKING 
FEEDBACK ABOUT THE DIFFERENT 
DATES AND SO FORTH AND IT'S

[Captioner] 22:06:19
 A 
LIVING DOCUMENT SO WE'LL 
CONTINUE TO LOOK

[Captioner] 22:06:22
 AT IT AND ADD,

[Captioner] 22:06:26
 
AS DEEMS FIT BY THE COUNCIL.


[Captioner] 22:06:31
>> Councilmember Cox:   I THINK 
IT SHOULD BE A LITTLE MORE 
SPECIFIC IF WE'RE GOING

[Captioner] 22:06:33
 TO DO 
THIS, THAT IT'S A LIVING 
DOCUMENT.


[Captioner] 22:06:36
BUT IT GIVES THE APPEARANCE THAT 
IF IT'S NOT

[Captioner] 22:06:40
 WRITTEN, IT GIVES 
THE APPEARANCE

[Captioner] 22:06:43
 THAT IF IT'S NOT 
WRITTEN IN NOW, IT MAY NOT

[Captioner] 22:06:46
 BE 
WRITTEN.
BECAUSE IT'S NOT

[Captioner] 22:06:50
 FORMALLY 
LISTING THINGS THAT WE TALKED 
ABOUT ALREADY.

[Captioner] 22:06:53

SO THAT'S WHAT MY CONCERN IS.
I HEAR IT'S

[Captioner] 22:06:56
 LIVING BUT I GOT TO 
RECOGNIZE THAT IF I VOTE TONIGHT 
IT'S

[Captioner] 22:06:59
 VOTING ON THE LIST AS-IS

[Captioner] 22:07:02
 
AND NOT AS AMENDED OR SUGGESTED.
>> Mayor Mei:   WELL ONE

[Captioner] 22:07:06
 OF THE 
THINGS WE WANT TO CLARIFY IS 
THERE ARE THESE ITEMS

[Captioner] 22:07:09
 AND 
PERHAPS THIS IS SOMETHING THAT 
WE WOULD HAVE TO LOOK AT BUT

[Captioner] 22:07:12
 WE 
HAVE SAID THIS IS THE ITEMS THAT 
WE ARE PRESENTING

[Captioner] 22:07:15
 AT THE COUNCIL 
MEETINGS.
AND THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT 


[Captioner] 22:07:18
EVENTS AND OCCASIONS AND WE HAVE 
CHURCHES AND OTHER PLACES THAT

[Captioner] 22:07:22
 
HAVE 150th ANNIVERSARY AND 
OTHER THINGS AND THOSE ARE

[Captioner] 22:07:26
 NOT 
USUALLY PRESENTED AT COUNCIL 
MEETINGS, THOSE ARE

[Captioner] 22:07:29
 THINGS THAT 
PEOPLE HAVE WRITTEN TO ASK 
SPECIFICALLY FOR

[Captioner] 22:07:32
 THEIR EVENTS.
SO WE WANTED TO BE ABLE TO STILL 
PROVIDE

[Captioner] 22:07:36
 THAT FLEXIBILITY BECAUSE 
WE HAVE HAD INCREDIBLE

[Captioner] 22:07:40
 LONGEVITY 
IN OUR COMMUNITY, PEOPLE

[Captioner] 22:07:44
 HITTING 
THEIR 100th BIRTHDAY.


[Captioner] 22:07:47
FOR EXAMPLE WE HAVE OHLONE 
COLLEGE THAT IS HITTING

[Captioner] 22:07:50
 THEIR 
50th ANNIVERSARY FOR THEIR 
DEAF COLLEGE

[Captioner] 22:07:53
 PROGRAM AND WE 
MIGHT ASK THEM TO PRESENT

[Captioner] 22:07:56
 
SOMETHING AT THEIR EVENT.
THAT IS SEPARATE.


[Captioner] 22:08:00
THAT'S WHY WE'RE TRYING TO FOCUS 
THE COUNCIL MEETINGS

[Captioner] 22:08:03
 AND HAVING 
SOME NEED BACK FROM THE 
COMMUNITY

[Captioner] 22:08:06
 MEMBERS THIS IS THE 
LIST WE HAVE NOW.
OUR COUNSEL

[Captioner] 22:08:09
 RETREAT WILL BE IN 
JANUARY AND AT THAT TIME IF 
THERE ARE THINGS THAT NEEDED TO

[Captioner] 22:08:12
 
CHANGE BUT THIS IS THE LIST THAT 
WE HAVE RIGHT NOW.


[Captioner] 22:08:15
I DON'T THINK THERE IS ANY 
OBJECTION TO THE DATES OR THE

[Captioner] 22:08:18
 
SUGGESTIONS THAT YOU SUBMITTED 
ALSO,

[Captioner] 22:08:21
 OR ASKED ABOUT, BUT I 
THINK THAT IT WON'T BE LIMITED 
TO

[Captioner] 22:08:24
 JUST THAT DATE.
SO I DON'T KNOW IF ANYONE ELSE 
WANTS

[Captioner] 22:08:27
 TO COMMENT AND IF THE 
MAKER AND THE SECOND WOULD LIKE 
TO MAKE

[Captioner] 22:08:30
 ANY CHANGES I KNOW THAT 
YOU MADE THE MOTION,

[Captioner] 22:08:33
 
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN.
AND COUNCILMEMBER KENG.


[Captioner] 22:08:36
SO --
>> Councilmember Keng:   YES SO 
I THINK WE SHOULD ADD EARLIER

[Captioner] 22:08:41
 
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN MENTIONED 
THAT THE HINDU MONTH AND THE

[Captioner] 22:08:44
 
MUSLIM MONTH WHICH WE JUST DID 
TODAY, RIGHT?


[Captioner] 22:08:47
SO I THINK THERE ARE SOME AND 
THEN ALSO

[Captioner] 22:08:50
 SOME THAT 
COUNCILMEMBER COX SAID ABOUT 
SOME

[Captioner] 22:08:53
 OF THE THINGS THAT WE 
ALREADY CELEBRATE LIKE

[Captioner] 22:08:57
 IN THE 
LAST, LAST YEAR SO MAYBE

[Captioner] 22:09:00
 --
>> Mayor Mei:   AND CHINESE 
AMERICAN DAY MAYBE

[Captioner] 22:09:03
.
>> Councilmember Keng:   THERE 
ARE SOME WE MAY HAVE MISSED AND 


[Captioner] 22:09:07
CERTAINLY TAKE INTO 
CONSIDERATION AND LOOK AT THE 
LIST THAT

[Captioner] 22:09:11
 BOTH COUNCILMEMBER 
SALWAN

[Captioner] 22:09:14
 AND COME HAD.
>> Mayor Mei:   AND SHAO

[Captioner] 22:09:19
.
>> Councilmember Keng:   AND TO 
CITY ATTORNEY ALVARADO'S

[Captioner] 22:09:22
 POINT, 
ADDING TO THE EFFICIENCY OF THE 
STAFF SO THEY CAN

[Captioner] 22:09:25
 GO AHEAD AND 
PREPARE THOSE PROCLAMATION 
WITHOUT HAVING TO GO

[Captioner] 22:09:28
 THROUGH ALL 
THE, YOU KNOW, APPLICATION AND 
REQUEST AND

[Captioner] 22:09:31
 THINGS LIKE THAT SO 
THEY CAN PREPARE IT AHEAD OF 
TIME.


[Captioner] 22:09:34
SO THAT WOULD ACTUALLY, YOU 
KNOW, HELP WITH THE STAFF

[Captioner] 22:09:37
.
>> Councilmember Salwan:   
COUNCILMEMBER COX BY ALL MEANS 


[Captioner] 22:09:41
SUBMIT YOUR LIST TO THE CITY 
STAFF AND I THINK YOU SHOULD BE 
GIVEN

[Captioner] 22:09:44
 
GIVEN THE DUE DEFERENCE AS FAR 
AS

[Captioner] 22:09:48
 PROTOCOL AND PROCEDURE.
BUT IN THE INTEREST OF MOVING

[Captioner] 22:09:50
 
THIS FORWARD I WOULD LIKE TO GO 
AHEAD WITH THIS AS LONG AS YOU 


[Captioner] 22:09:53
CAN SUBMIT THE DATES THAT YOU 
MENTIONED.
>> Mayor Mei:   AND

[Captioner] 22:09:58
 ALSO 
COUNCILMEMBER SHAO I THINK ALSO, 
ANYONE ON THE COUNCIL.

[Captioner] 22:09:59

>> Councilmember Salwan:   
ABSOLUTELY.


[Captioner] 22:10:02
>> Mayor Mei:   ONE OF THE 
THINGS WE HAVE TO REVISIT IN THE 
RETREAT

[Captioner] 22:10:05
 IS THE EFFICIENCY 
BECAUSE I THINK THAT IS NOT WHAT 
THE MAJORITY

[Captioner] 22:10:08
 OF THE PEOPLE ARE 
COMING TO FOCUS ON.


[Captioner] 22:10:12
>> Councilmember Cox:   YES, I 
AGREE THERE IS MORE IMPORTANT 
ISSUES THAT WE NEED TO

[Captioner] 22:10:16
 WORK 
THROUGH BUT I APPRECIATE THE 
COMMENTS OF COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN

[Captioner] 22:10:20
 
AND MAYOR MEI TO HAVE IT UNDER 
CONVERSATION AND

[Captioner] 22:10:23
 WITH FELLOW 
COUNCILMEMBER KENG AND MAKING 
SURE THAT

[Captioner] 22:10:26
 THINGS ARE ADDRESSED 
ACCORDINGLY, THAT MAKES ME FEEL

[Captioner] 22:10:29
 
A LOT BETTER.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 22:10:32
>> Councilmember Salwan:   
ABSOLUTELY.
>> Mayor Mei:   SO WE HAVE

[Captioner] 22:10:35
 
MOTION AND SECOND.
PLEASE VOTE WITH YOUR DAIS 


[Captioner] 22:10:38
BUTTON.
>> JUST TO BE CLEAR, NO 
AMENDMENT WAS ACCEPTED TO THE

[Captioner] 22:10:40
 
MOTION.
SO THIS IS JUST THE ORIGINAL 


[Captioner] 22:10:43
MOTION WITH NO CHANGES.


[Captioner] 22:10:46
>> Mayor Mei:   WELL, DID YOU 
AMEND IT?
I THINK

[Captioner] 22:10:50
 YOU --

[Captioner] 22:10:51

>> Councilmember Salwan:   
THAT'S CORRECT.


[Captioner] 22:10:54
IT WAS AMENDED TO INCLUDE THE 
FEEDBACK

[Captioner] 22:10:56
 FROM FELLOW 
COUNCILMEMBERS.
>> Mayor Mei:   ON ADDITIONAL 


[Captioner] 22:11:00
DAYS.
>> OKAY, SO THIS IS A

[Captioner] 22:11:04
 GOOD 
OPPORTUNITY TO CLARIFY 
BECAUSE --

[Captioner] 22:11:06

>> Mayor Mei:   FOR PURPOSES 
OF --


[Captioner] 22:11:09
>> FOR PURPOSES OF THIS 
RESOLUTION --
>> Mayor Mei:   WE

[Captioner] 22:11:13
 CAN'T CHANGE.
>> YOU CAN CHANGE IT.
THE COUNCIL

[Captioner] 22:11:16
 MAJORITY THIS 
EVENING CAN ADD AS MANY OR AS 
LITTLE CELEBRATION

[Captioner] 22:11:19
S AS IT 
DESIRES.
IT ALSO DOESN'T HAVE TO ADOPT

[Captioner] 22:11:22
 
ANY RESOLUTION AND CAN YOU 
MAINTAIN YOUR EXISTING PROCESS.


[Captioner] 22:11:26
BUT IF WE'RE GOING TO ADD TO THE 
LIST, THAT

[Captioner] 22:11:29
 WAS PUBLICIZED IT 
WOULD BE GOOD FOR THE COUNCIL

[Captioner] 22:11:33
 
MAJORITY TO WEIGH IN ON WHICH 
ONES ARE GOING TO BE ADDED SO

[Captioner] 22:11:36
 
THE RECORD IS CLEAR THAT THE 
RESOLUTION REFLECTS THE

[Captioner] 22:11:39
 COUNCIL 
MAJORITY'S VOTE.
>> Councilmember Salwan:   OKAY 


[Captioner] 22:11:42
SO LET'S ACTUALLY TABLE THAT FOR 
MAYBE THE RETREAT

[Captioner] 22:11:45
 AND WE CAN 
APPROVE THE REST.
>> YOU ARE THE

[Captioner] 22:11:48
 MOVERS.
>> Councilmember Salwan:   I 
THINK HERE WE CAN'T FIGURE

[Captioner] 22:11:52
 OUT 
THE DATES AND WE NEED TO HAMMER 
THIS OUT IN LONGER SESSION

[Captioner] 22:11:55
.
>> WHAT STAFF HAS ALSO HEARD IS

 ABOUT WHO 
THE STAFF WAS --
>> Councilmember Salwan:   I 


[Captioner] 22:12:28
THINK SHE WAS SATISFIED.
>> Mayor Mei:   I THINK THE 
STAFF

[Captioner] 22:12:31
 HAS NOTED THE EDITS THAT 
SHE ASKED

[Captioner] 22:12:34
 ABOUT.
>> Councilmember Salwan:   DO WE

[Captioner] 22:27:27
 ON ONE
HAND A RESPONSE TO A REFERRAL
THAT MAYOR MEI MADE

[Captioner] 22:27:31

REGARDING MITIGATION OF
HOMELESSNESS

[Captioner] 22:27:35
 IMPACTS, ALONG WITH
AN INFORMATIONAL ITEM FOR YOU
ALL THIS

[Captioner] 22:27:38
 EVENING, REALLY A
STATUS UPDATE AND COMPREHENSIVE
OVERVIEW OF

[Captioner] 22:27:42
 THE CITY'S EFFORTS
ON ALL THINGS RELATED TO
HOMELESSNESS

[Captioner] 22:27:45
 AND WITH THAT, I'LL
TURN IT OVER TO ALLEN

[Captioner] 22:27:49
 DEMERS,
ASSISTANT TO THE CITY MANAGER.


[Captioner] 22:27:54
>> THANK YOU, KRISTINA.
I'M

[Captioner] 22:27:58
 GOING TO SHARE MY SCREEN
HERE.


[Captioner] 22:28:03
AND NOTE THAT JOINING ME FOR


[Captioner] 22:28:07
THIS PRESENTATION IS LAUREN
FLORES, THE

[Captioner] 22:28:10
 CITY'S HOMELESS
SERVICES MANAGER, AND

[Captioner] 22:28:13
 AS
KRISTINA MENTIONED, WE ARE

[Captioner] 22:28:17
 GOING
TO PRESENT A STAFF REPORT THAT
IS

[Captioner] 22:28:22
 RESPONSIVE TO COUNCIL'S
REFERRAL ISSUE BY MAYOR

[Captioner] 22:28:25
 MEI ON
SEPTEMBER 6TH.
THIS REPORT

[Captioner] 22:28:29
 PROVIDES FOR A
GENERAL OVERVIEW OF THE STATUS
OF

[Captioner] 22:28:33
 HOMELESSNESS IN THE CITY OF
FREMONT.
THE

[Captioner] 22:28:36
 CITY'S MITIGATION ACTIVITIES
WITH A SPECIAL

[Captioner] 22:28:41
 FOCUS ON THE
HEALTH HAZARDS, ILLEGAL

[Captioner] 22:28:44
 DUMPING
AND RELATED CLEAN-UPS THAT WERE
MENTIONED IN THE REFERRAL,

[Captioner] 22:28:48
 BUT
ALSO TO PROVIDE A GENERAL
OVERVIEW OF THE

[Captioner] 22:28:51
 WORK THAT IS
BEING DONE BY STAFF MEMBERS


[Captioner] 22:28:54
ACROSS THE CITY OF FREMONT TO
ADDRESS

[Captioner] 22:28:59
 HOMELESSNESS.
I WANT TO NOTE THAT THIS REPORT


[Captioner] 22:29:03
IS NOT REQUESTING

[Captioner] 22:29:06
 ACTION BY THE
CITY COUNCIL TONIGHT OTHER THAN
TO

[Captioner] 22:29:09
 ACCEPT THE REPORT AS
RESPONSIVE

[Captioner] 22:29:12
 TO THE REFERRAL, AND
I'LL

[Captioner] 22:29:16
 MENTION SOME NEXT STEPS AT
THE END OF THE MEETING, BUT


[Captioner] 22:29:19
WE'RE GOING TO START OUT TALKING
ABOUT MITIGATION AND

[Captioner] 22:29:23
 ACTIVITY --
MITIGATION ACTIVITY AND
COMMUNITY SUPPORT, WE'RE GOING


[Captioner] 22:29:27
TO DISCUSS DIRECT ASSISTANCE TO
OUR UNHOUSED

[Captioner] 22:29:31
 RESIDENTS, WE'RE
GOING TO MENTION

[Captioner] 22:29:34
 AFFORDABLE
HOUSING, AND A BRIEF SURVEY

[Captioner] 22:29:36
 OF
ADDITIONAL STRATEGIES THAT WE
CONDUCTED.


[Captioner] 22:29:44
THE 2022 POINT IN TIME COUNT AND
SURVEY REPORT RELEASED

[Captioner] 22:29:47
 IN AUGUST
IS THE CITY'S MOST CURRENT AND


[Captioner] 22:29:51
COMPREHENSIVE DATA ON THE STATE
OF HOMELESSNESS

[Captioner] 22:29:54
 IN FREMONT.
THE COMMUNITY COUNT IDENTIFIED
THAT

[Captioner] 22:29:57
 AT LEAST 1,026 RESIDENTS OF
FREMONT

[Captioner] 22:30:00
 ARE UNHOUSED, WHICH IS A


[Captioner] 22:30:04
68% INCREASE IN HOMELESSNESS
FROM THE LAST COUNT CONDUCTED
THREE

[Captioner] 22:30:07
 YEARS AGO.
RESPONDENTS TO THE

[Captioner] 22:30:10
 SURVEY
IDENTIFIED THAT THE CAUSE OF
THEIR HOMELESSNESS WAS

[Captioner] 22:30:12

LARGELY --
>> Mayor Mei: APOLOGIES, ALLEN,


[Captioner] 22:30:15
I DON'T THINK YOUR PRESENTATION
IS

[Captioner] 22:30:20
 MOVING IN LINE WITH -- AT
LEAST MINE IS JUST FROZEN ON

[Captioner] 22:30:23
 THE
COVER PAGE RIGHT NOW.
>> Ms. Gauthier: ALBERTO CAN


[Captioner] 22:30:27
SHARE HIS SCREEN AND IT APPEARS
THAT ALLEN'S SCREEN IS

[Captioner] 22:30:30
 FROZEN.
>> SORRY ABOUT THAT.
THANK YOU, ALBERTO.


[Captioner] 22:30:33
>> Mayor Mei: NO, AND THANK

[Captioner] 22:30:35
 YOU
FOR THAT.
SO I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE


[Captioner] 22:30:38
PEOPLE KNEW.
THANK YOU.
>> IF YOU CAN ADVANCE ONE SLIDE,


[Captioner] 22:30:41
ALBERTO.


[Captioner] 22:30:45
SO AS

[Captioner] 22:30:48
 MENTIONED, THE HOMELESS
POPULATION OF FREMONT IS
ESTIMATED

[Captioner] 22:30:52
 AT 1,026 BASED ON OUR
POINT IN TIME COUNT, WHICH IS

[Captioner] 22:30:55
 A
SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE OVER

[Captioner] 22:30:59
 THE
POPULATION THAT WAS COUNTED
THREE YEARS AGO.


[Captioner] 22:31:09
48% OF THE HOMELESS RESIDENTS IN
FREMONT REPORT THAT THEY HAVE A


[Captioner] 22:31:12
DISABLING CONDITION, WHICH MEANS
THAT THEY LIVE WITH A

[Captioner] 22:31:15
 LONG-TERM
PHYSICAL OR MENTAL DISABILITY
THAT IMPACTS THEIR

[Captioner] 22:31:18
 ABILITY TO
LIVE INDEPENDENTLY OR TAKE THE
NECESSARY

[Captioner] 22:31:22
 STEPS TO SECURE
HOUSING.


[Captioner] 22:31:28
14% OF THOSE COUNTED ARE
EMPLOYED

[Captioner] 22:31:31
 AND 35% ARE SEEKING
EMPLOYMENT.


[Captioner] 22:31:35
BUT 80% OF THE HOMELESS


[Captioner] 22:31:39
RESIDENTS ARE UNSHELTERED,
MEANING THEY ARE SLEEPING

[Captioner] 22:31:42
 OR
RESIDING IN A PLACE NOT MEANT
FOR HUMAN HABITATION, LIKE

[Captioner] 22:31:46
 A
VEHICLE, A

[Captioner] 22:31:49
 TENT ENCAMPMENT OR AN
ABANDONED BUILDING.


[Captioner] 22:31:52
GENERALLY SPEAKING, THERE ARE
MORE

[Captioner] 22:31:55
 HOMELESS IN THE CITY OF
FREMONT AND THOSE HOMELESS
INDIVIDUALS ARE

[Captioner] 22:31:58
 REMAINING
HOMELESS LONGER THAN THEY WERE
BEFORE.


[Captioner] 22:32:03
IF YOU CAN ADVANCE.


[Captioner] 22:32:10
SO, THE CITY'S STRATEGY TO


[Captioner] 22:32:13
ADDRESSING HOMELESSNESS IS
CURRENTLY A BALANCED


[Captioner] 22:32:16
MULTIDISCIPLINARY

[Captioner] 22:32:20
 APPROACH, A
PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN MULTIPLE
DEPARTMENTS IN

[Captioner] 22:32:26

OUR

[Captioner] 22:35:40
 POLICE DEPARTMENT PROVIDES
FOR THE GENERAL LAW

[Captioner] 22:35:44
 ENFORCEMENT
AND SAFETY SERVICES THAT WE ALL
EXPECT FROM A

[Captioner] 22:35:47
 POLICE DEPARTMENT.


[Captioner] 22:35:50
THEIR PRIMARY METRIC FOR
HOMELESS SERVICES

[Captioner] 22:35:55
 CALLS IS A
CODE FOR SERVICE THAT THEY
ASSOCIATE WITH A

[Captioner] 22:35:58
 REQUEST FOR
SERVICE RESULTING FROM A


[Captioner] 22:36:02
HOMELESSNESS ISSUE.
OVER THE LAST TWO

[Captioner] 22:36:05
 YEARS, THE
POLICE DEPARTMENT HAS RECEIVED
10,000 CALLS

[Captioner] 22:36:10
 FOR SERVICE RELATED
TO

[Captioner] 22:36:13
 HOMELESSNESS ISSUES.
TO PUT THAT NUMBER IN
PERSPECTIVE,

[Captioner] 22:36:16
 OVER THAT SAME
PERIOD, THEY DID

[Captioner] 22:36:19
 RECEIVE 300,000
TOTAL CALL FORCE SERVICE OF ALL
TYPES.


[Captioner] 22:36:23
SO CALLS FOR SERVICE RELATED TO
HOMELESS

[Captioner] 22:36:26
 INDIVIDUALS REPRESENTS
APPROXIMATELY 3% OF

[Captioner] 22:36:29
 THEIR
ONGOING CALLS FOR SERVICE.


[Captioner] 22:36:33
SLIDE, PLEASE.
THE CITY

[Captioner] 22:36:36

IT CONNECTS COMMUNITY

[Captioner] 22:37:05

NEEDING ASSISTANCE WITH LOCAL
MENTAL HEALTH AND HOMELESS


[Captioner] 22:37:08
SERVICE PROVIDERS.
ALTHOUGH THE FOCUS OF THE

[Captioner] 22:37:12
 MET
TEAM IS TO CONNECT PEOPLE AND
SERVICES, THE

[Captioner] 22:37:15
 TEAM HAS ALSO BEEN
REPURPOSED

[Captioner] 22:37:18
 TO PROVIDE SECURITY
OVERSIGHT DURING

[Captioner] 22:37:21

[Captioner] 22:37:34

FREMONT'S FIRE DEPARTMENT TRACKS

[Captioner] 22:37:37
 FOR SERVICE
AS WELL, RESULTING FROM
HOMELESSNESS OR

[Captioner] 22:37:41

HOMELESSNESS-RELATED ISSUES.
IN THE LAST TWO FISCAL

[Captioner] 22:37:44
 YEARS,
THE FIRE DEPARTMENT ESTIMATES IT
HAS

[Captioner] 22:37:47
 RECEIVED 2900 TOTAL
HOMELESSNESS-RELATED CALLS

[Captioner] 22:37:51
 FOR
SERVICE.
852 OF THOSE WERE RELATED

[Captioner] 22:37:54

 CONCERNS, AND JUST
NORTH OF 1400 OF THOSE CALLS
WERE RELATED TO HEALTH

[Captioner] 22:38:01
 AND
RESCUE.
I'M GOING TO TURN IT OVER

[Captioner] 22:38:04
 TO
LAURIE NOW TO DISCUSS THE DIRECT


[Captioner] 22:38:08

AT THIS TIME, WINTER RELIEF IS


[Captioner] 22:39:22

OF THE YEAR.


[Captioner] 22:39:25
SUFFICIENT AVAILABILITY OF THESE
TYPES OF PROGRAMS CAN BALANCE

ENFORCEMENT BY PROVIDING LOW
BARRIER OPTIONS TO RELOCATE TO

EXAMPLE.

OF PROGRAMS THAT EITHER PROVIDE
AFFORDABLE PLACES TO

SO IN CLOSING, AND AS KRISTINA
REFERENCED EARLIER IN

[Captioner] 22:44:39
 THE
MEETING, CITY STAFF

[Captioner] 22:44:42
 IS CURRENTLY
CONSTRUCTING AN

[Captioner] 22:44:45
 RFP FOR A
CONSULTANT THAT WILL ASSIST THE
CITY

[Captioner] 22:44:49
 IN CONSTRUCTING A
HOMELESSNESS RESPONSE MASTER
PLAN.


[Captioner] 22:44:53
WE EXPECT TO ISSUE THAT

[Captioner] 22:44:56
 RFP AT
THE END OF NOVEMBER, AND

[Captioner] 22:44:59
 THAT
RFP WILL

[Captioner] 22:45:02
 REQUIRE A CONSULTANT
THAT WILL ADVISE

[Captioner] 22:45:05
 US IN
CONSTRUCTING THIS PLAN THAT WILL
HELP

[Captioner] 22:45:10
 US REVIEW HOW WE'RE
SPENDING OUR RESOURCES ON

[Captioner] 22:45:13

HOMELESS SERVICES AND PROVIDE US
WITH RECOMMENDATIONS

[Captioner] 22:45:16
 FOR
POTENTIAL POLICY

[Captioner] 22:45:19
 CHANGES.
IT IS LIKELY THAT THAT

[Captioner] 22:45:23
 WILL
NECESSITATE STAFF RETURNING TO
COUNCIL WITH A DRAFT

[Captioner] 22:45:26
 HOMELESS
RESPONSE MASTER PLAN, AND AT
THAT TIME,

[Captioner] 22:45:30
 STAFF WILL SEEK
ADDITIONAL

[Captioner] 22:45:33
 COUNCIL DIRECTION
REGARDING NEXT STEPS.
IN THE

[Captioner] 22:45:37
 MEANTIME, STAFF REQUESTS
THAT COUNCIL ACCEPT

[Captioner] 22:45:40
 THIS
REFERRAL RESPONSE WITH THE
UNDERSTANDING THAT WE'LL BE


[Captioner] 22:45:43
RETURNING FOR ADDITIONAL
DIRECTION ONCE WE HAVE A

[Captioner] 22:45:45
 DRAFT
HOMELESS RESPONSE MASTER PLAN
COMPLETED.


[Captioner] 22:45:50
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF SUBJECT
MATTER EXPERTS

[Captioner] 22:45:53
 FROM ACROSS THE
CITY THAT ARE ON THE CALL IF
THERE ARE SPECIFIC

[Captioner] 22:45:56
 QUESTIONS AT
THIS TIME, AND I WANT

[Captioner] 22:45:59
 TO THANK
THOSE FOLKS AND ALL

[Captioner] 22:46:03
 OF THEIR
STAFF THROUGHOUT THE CITY FOR
ALL OF THE WORK THAT THEY

[Captioner] 22:46:06
 HAVE
DONE TO PREPARE THIS RESPONSE
AND FOR THE WORK

[Captioner] 22:46:09
 THAT THEY DO ON
AN ONGOING BASIS.
SO

[Captioner] 22:46:12
 WITH THAT, I THINK WE'LL TAKE


[Captioner] 22:46:16
QUESTIONS IF THERE ARE ANY.


[Captioner] 22:46:21
>> Mayor Mei: SURE.
SO I WANT TO THANK ALL OF YOU
FOR BEING ON THE CALL AND FOR


[Captioner] 22:46:24
PROVIDING THIS REPORT.
I WANT TO

[Captioner] 22:46:28
 CLARIFY ALSO, I THINK
LAURIE, I'VE ASKED THIS

[Captioner] 22:46:30
 QUESTION
BEFORE JUST FOR A QUICK
CLARIFYING QUESTION, IS THAT


[Captioner] 22:46:33
WHEN I LOOK AT OUR DATA, OUR
CITY IS A

[Captioner] 22:46:36
 LITTLE UNIQUE WHEN I
COMPARE TO SOME OF THE OTHER
CITIES THAT WE HAVE

[Captioner] 22:46:39
 ACTUALLY
SEEN A REDUCTION OF

[Captioner] 22:46:43
 THE TENT
RESIDENTS, UNSHELTERED

[Captioner] 22:46:46

RESIDENTS, BUT WE'VE SEEN A
TREMENDOUS

[Captioner] 22:46:49
 INCREASE IN THE CAR
AND RV, AND I THINK THAT ALSO
LEADS TO

[Captioner] 22:46:53
 SOME OF THE GROWTH THAT
WE'VE BEEN SEEING, BECAUSE
UNLIKE IN PAST

[Captioner] 22:46:56
 YEARS, JUST TO
CLARIFY, I THINK WE USED TO HAVE
A ONE ON ONE IN TERMS OF

[Captioner] 22:46:59
 WHEN WE
SAID, YOU KNOW, WE'D ANTICIPATED


[Captioner] 22:47:02
THAT I THINK IT WAS LIKE ONE
PERSON ALLOCATED PER

[Captioner] 22:47:05
 VEHICLE
BECAUSE WE REALLY COULDN'T TELL
AND THIS

[Captioner] 22:47:09
 YEAR IT WAS UNFORTUNATE
THAT WE HAD TO WAIT A YEAR, SO
IT'S THREE YEARS INSTEAD

[Captioner] 22:47:13
 OF TWO
YEARS, AND BECAUSE OF THE


[Captioner] 22:47:16
INCREDIBLY COLD MORNING THAT
WERE OUT

[Captioner] 22:47:20
 THERE, LIKE 34,
36 DEGREES OUT THERE, WE WERE
ABLE TO HAVE BETTER

[Captioner] 22:47:24
 VISIBILITY
INTO SOME OF THE CAR AND RV
PARKING, BUT I THINK WE

[Captioner] 22:47:27
 HAD ALSO
APPLIED A FACTOR, THERE WAS A
PRE-STUDY

[Captioner] 22:47:31
 CONDUCTED IN TERMS OF
CAR AND RVs, AND I THINK MY


[Captioner] 22:47:34
UNDERSTANDING, IF YOU COULD
CLARIFY, THERE WAS A FACTOR


[Captioner] 22:47:37
APPLIED INSTEAD OF THE ONE ON
ONE IN THE PAST, SO ONE VEHICLE


[Captioner] 22:47:41
EQUALS ONE PERSON, WE ALSO PUT A
FACTOR IN THIS TIME AROUND FROM
THE

[Captioner] 22:47:44
 COUNTY FOR THE POINT IN TIME
COUNT.


[Captioner] 22:47:50
>> MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT,
YES, WHAT THEY CALL A

[Captioner] 22:47:54
 MULTIPLIER
IS

[Captioner] 22:47:57
 APPLIED TO TENTS, VEHICLES
AND ABANDONED

[Captioner] 22:48:00
 BUILDINGS COUNTED
BECAUSE IT IS NOT A ONE

[Captioner] 22:48:03
 FOR ONE
SCENARIO, THERE COULD BE
MULTIPLE PEOPLE LIVING IN

[Captioner] 22:48:06
 A
VEHICLE, TENT OR BUILDING.


[Captioner] 22:48:10
BUT MY UNDERSTANDING FROM THOSE
THAT

[Captioner] 22:48:13
 CONDUCTED THE COUNT
METHODOLOGY AND DATA, THAT THAT
WAS

[Captioner] 22:48:16
 A SIMILAR PROCESS DONE IN
YEARS PAST.


[Captioner] 22:48:21
>> Mayor Mei: I THINK IT WAS A
SIMILAR PROCESS BUT IF I
REMEMBER CORRECTLY,

[Captioner] 22:48:24
 I'D ASKED
THIS QUESTION EARLIER WHEN WE
FIRST SAW THE DATA, I THINK PART


[Captioner] 22:48:27
OF IT IS ALSO SINCE WE'RE ADDING
A MULTIPLIER,

[Captioner] 22:48:30
 I THINK THE TYPES
OF -- THE

[Captioner] 22:48:33
 MULTIPLIER APPLIED
BECAUSE IN THE PAST IF YOU LOOK
AT OUR

[Captioner] 22:48:37
 DETAIL, AND I KNOW WE
DON'T HAVE IT HERE BUT I'M
LOOKING AT

[Captioner] 22:48:41
 THE EVERYONE HOME
DETAILED POINT IN TIME COUNT AND
YOU CAN SEE

[Captioner] 22:48:45
 FREMONT 2019 VERSUS
2022, AND IN PARTICULAR, YOU

[Captioner] 22:48:49
 CAN
SEE ON THE CAR AND VAN, THERE
WAS

[Captioner] 22:48:52
 A TREMENDOUS INCREASE THERE,
ALMOST DOUBLING IN PERCENTAGE OF


[Captioner] 22:48:55
HOMELESSNESS RIGHT THERE ALONE,
AND THEN OF COURSE SOME INCREASE
IN RV,

[Captioner] 22:48:58
 SO I JUST WANTED TO NOTE
THAT TO THE PUBLIC.


[Captioner] 22:49:01
SO THAT'S WHY THE WHOLE SAFE
PARKING DISCUSSION AND WE WERE
REALLY HOPING

[Captioner] 22:49:05
 FOR THE PROJECT
HOMEKEY, SO I'M HOPING THAT

[Captioner] 22:49:07
 WE
CAN STILL CONTINUE.
I KNOW THAT WE'RE PUTTING IN FOR


[Captioner] 22:49:10
THE ROUND THREE.
AND SO I ALSO

[Captioner] 22:49:13
 WANT TO LOOK FOR
ANY OTHER CLARIFYING QUESTIONS.
I SEE COUNCILMEMBER

[Captioner] 22:49:15
 KASSAN AND
THEN WE ALSO HAVE PUBLIC
SPEAKERS, I THINK.


[Captioner] 22:49:24
>> Councilmember Kassan: UM,
LET'S SEE.
I HAD A QUESTION THAT I FOR

[Captioner] 22:49:28
 FORGOT,
BUT I HAVE ANOTHER

[Captioner] 22:49:32
 QUESTION, AND
THAT IS I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR
WHAT YOU

[Captioner] 22:49:35
 WOULD DO

[Captioner] 22:49:39
 WITH
$10 MILLION TO ADDRESS THE
PROBLEM AT

[Captioner] 22:49:43
 THE ROOT, SO THAT WE
COULD REDUCE SOME OF THESE


[Captioner] 22:49:46
EXPENDITURES ON, QUOTE-UNQUOTE,
MITIGATION, IF YOU

[Captioner] 22:49:46
 HAD
$10 MILLION.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 22:49:55
>> COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, THAT'S
NOT INFORMATION THAT

[Captioner] 22:49:58
 WE PREPARED


[Captioner] 22:50:02
FOR TONIGHT, SORT OF OUTSIDE THE
BOUNDS OF

[Captioner] 22:50:05
 THE REFERRAL AND THE
INFORMATION PREPARED.
I'M SORRY.


[Captioner] 22:50:10
>> AND AS ALAN INDICATED, THAT'S
PRECISELY ONE OF THE QUESTIONS


[Captioner] 22:50:13
WE WOULD LIKE TO POSE IN THE
MASTER PLAN PROCESS, YOU

[Captioner] 22:50:17
 KNOW,
SPECIFICALLY ABOUT HOW TO
ALLOCATE

[Captioner] 22:50:20
 RESOURCES.
ACROSS THE CITY'S PROGRAMS.


[Captioner] 22:50:32
>> Mayor Mei: NEXT IS
COUNCILMEMBER JONES.
DID YOU HAVE A CLARIFYING


[Captioner] 22:50:35
QUESTION?
>> Councilmember Jones: NO, I
THINK MR. DEMERS ANSWERED

[Captioner] 22:50:36
 THE
QUESTION.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 22:50:39
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
AND NOW I'LL TURN TO

[Captioner] 22:50:43
 THE PUBLIC
FOR THEIR COMMENTS AT THIS TIME.


[Captioner] 22:50:49
OH, SORRY.
OH, SORRY, COUNCILMEMBER KENG
JUST SHOWED UP.


[Captioner] 22:50:52
SORRY, COUNCILMEMBER KENG.
>> Vice Mayor Keng: SURE, THANK
YOU, MADAME MAYOR.


[Captioner] 22:50:56
I HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS.


[Captioner] 22:51:02
FIRST, IN THE EXPECTED INCREASE
IN BUDGET IN

[Captioner] 22:51:05
 ABATEMENT, WHERE
WOULD THIS BUDGET BE COMING OUT
FROM?


[Captioner] 22:51:09
>> I KNOW THAT STAFF IS ON THE
CALL THAT CAN ANSWER

[Captioner] 22:51:12
 THIS
QUESTION MORE EFFECTIVELY THAN
ME, BUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT


[Captioner] 22:51:15
THOSE ARE LARGELY

[Captioner] 22:51:18
 FEE-BASED
EXPENSES, SO THERE

[Captioner] 22:51:22
 IS NOT A
DIRECT IMPACT

[Captioner] 22:51:25
 TO THE CITY'S
OPERATING BUDGET.
IS THAT CORRECT?


[Captioner] 22:51:28
I SEE SUZANNE OUT THERE.
>> Ms. Wolf: 

[Captioner] 22:51:32
THAT IS CORRECT, WE
HAVE INTEGRATED WASTE MANAGEMENT
FUNDS THAT WE

[Captioner] 22:51:35
 WOULD GO TO, TO
LOOK TOWARDS -- FOR ADDITIONAL
FUNDING AT THIS

[Captioner] 22:51:39
 TIME.
>> Vice Mayor Keng: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 22:51:42
AND ANOTHER QUESTION IS RECENTLY
WE'VE BEEN RECEIVING A LOT OF


[Captioner] 22:51:46
EMAILS AND CALLS REGARDING SOME


[Captioner] 22:51:49
HOMELESS ACTIVITIES IN THE METRO


[Captioner] 22:51:53
CROSSING AREA, AND THERE WERE A
COUPLE CALLERS EARLIER THIS


[Captioner] 22:51:57
EVENING, AND WE SAW EARLIER THE
DATA, YOU

[Captioner] 22:52:02
 KNOW, OUR POLICE
RECEIVED ABOUT 10,000 CALLS IN
THE LAST TWO

[Captioner] 22:52:05
 YEARS, AND IF WE
WERE ABLE TO RESPOND TO SOME

[Captioner] 22:52:09
 OF
THESE CONCERNS IN THE METRO
CROSSING

[Captioner] 22:52:12
 AREA

[Captioner] 22:52:16
 YET?
>>

[Captioner] 22:52:20
 UM, I BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE --
>> Ms. Briggs: OUR

[Captioner] 22:52:23
 PUBLIC WORKS
DIRECTOR HANS LARSEN MAY BE ABLE
TO COMMENT ON THAT.


[Captioner] 22:52:37
>> Mr. Larsen: SO IF THE
QUESTION IS RELATED TO KIND OF


[Captioner] 22:52:41
POLICE RESPONSE, MAYBE THE
POLICE DEPARTMENT COULD

[Captioner] 22:52:44
 ADDRESS
THAT, BUT LET ME JUST ADDRESS
FOR THE COUNCIL

[Captioner] 22:52:47
 THE PROPOSAL TO
PUT UP

[Captioner] 22:52:50
 A GATE OR CLOSE THE


[Captioner] 22:52:54
CONNECTION OF THE STREET WHERE
IT TIES

[Captioner] 22:52:57
 IN WITH RESEARCH.
SO BECAUSE THAT'S A

[Captioner] 22:53:00
 PUBLIC
STREET, YOU CAN'T GATE

[Captioner] 22:53:03
 THE ROAD
AND SELECTIVELY PROVIDE ACCESS
JUST TO

[Captioner] 22:53:06
 THE RESIDENTS,

[Captioner] 22:53:09
 SO THAT'S
NOT LEGALLY ALLOWED ON A PUBLIC
ROAD.


[Captioner] 22:53:14
THERE'S BEEN PROPOSALS TO CHANGE
THE STREETS

[Captioner] 22:53:17
 TO PRIVATE STREETS,
AND THAT IS -- THAT WOULD BE


[Captioner] 22:53:21
VERY DIFFICULT TO ACHIEVE, GIVEN
JUST THE

[Captioner] 22:53:24
 WAY THAT THE ACCESS

[Captioner] 22:53:25
 IN
PROPERTY RIGHTS HAVE BEEN
ESTABLISHED WITHIN THAT NEW


[Captioner] 22:53:29
DEVELOPMENT, AND SO REALLY THE


[Captioner] 22:53:33
MECHANISM THAT WOULD SORT OF
ADDRESS KIND OF THE CONCERN

[Captioner] 22:53:37

THAT'S BEEN RAISED IS ACTUALLY
CLOSING THE

[Captioner] 22:53:41
 PUBLIC STREET AT TOM
BLALOCK

[Captioner] 22:53:44
 AND RESEARCH, AND SO
ESSENTIALLY PUT IN

[Captioner] 22:53:47
 A BACK TO
BACK CUL DE SAC AT THAT
LOCATION, AND

[Captioner] 22:53:50
 THEN WHETHER YOU
FENCE TO VEHICLES AND ALLOW


[Captioner] 22:53:54
PEDESTRIANS OR YOU CLOSE IT OFF


[Captioner] 22:53:58
TO EVERYBODY WOULD REQUIRE GOING
THROUGH A STUDY PROCESS

[Captioner] 22:54:02
 TO
EVALUATE THE ISSUES AND IMPACTS
WITH THAT KIND

[Captioner] 22:54:06
 OF CHANGE TO THE
STREET

[Captioner] 22:54:09
 SYSTEM.
AS THE COUNCIL MAY RECALL, WE
DID SOMETHING SIMILAR WITH THE


[Captioner] 22:54:13
CLOSURE OF MORRISON CANYON ROAD,
AND THAT

[Captioner] 22:54:17
 WAS A STUDY EFFORT THAT
WENT ON FOR A

[Captioner] 22:54:20
 YEAR, IT WAS ABOUT
$150,000 IN

[Captioner] 22:54:23
 CONSULTANT COST TO
DO THE STUDY, AND SO IF THAT WAS


[Captioner] 22:54:26
SOMETHING THAT THE COMMUNITY OR
COUNCIL WANTED TO CONSIDER,

[Captioner] 22:54:29
 YOU
KNOW, THAT WOULD BE THE
MECHANISM THAT WE WOULD NEED

[Captioner] 22:54:32
 TO
PURSUE TO ADDRESS THAT
PARTICULAR ISSUE.


[Captioner] 22:54:38
>> Vice Mayor Keng: GREAT, THANK
YOU SO MUCH.
AND LASTLY, I WAS REAL


[Captioner] 22:54:41
INTERESTED IN SEEING MORE


[Captioner] 22:54:44
INFORMATION ON THE PROJECT
REHOPE, WHERE ANOTHER CITY WAS


[Captioner] 22:54:47
ABLE TO RE-HOUSE -- WELL, THE
GOAL

[Captioner] 22:54:51
 IS TO RE-HOUSE THE FAMILIES
LIVING IN THE RVs WHEN

[Captioner] 22:54:54
 THEY
TRY TO RELOCATE THEM TO

[Captioner] 22:54:57
 AN
RV-SAFE PARKING, SO I THINK
THAT'S

[Captioner] 22:55:00
 REALLY ONE OF THE
PROJECTS THAT WE CAN REALLY
BENEFIT FROM.


[Captioner] 22:55:04
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 22:55:12
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
NEXT, I DON'T KNOW --
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN?


[Captioner] 22:55:14
>> Councilmember Kassan: I'M
SORRY, I REMEMBERED MY OTHER
QUESTION.


[Captioner] 22:55:17
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY.
I WAS JUST WONDERING.
>> Councilmember Kassan: SO I


[Captioner] 22:55:20
KNOW THAT WITH THE SAFE PARKING
PROGRAM, IT HAS BEEN USED A
LITTLE BIT LESS THAN WHAT

[Captioner] 22:55:24
 WE HAD
ANTICIPATED, WHICH IS SURPRISING


[Captioner] 22:55:28
GIVEN THE LARGER NUMBER OF
PEOPLE LIVING IN CARS.
I

[Captioner] 22:55:31
 WAS JUST WONDERING IF WE COULD
GET AN UPDATE

[Captioner] 22:55:36
 ON THAT, THE
CURRENT NUMBER OF PEOPLE USING
THE PROGRAM AND WHAT'S BEING


[Captioner] 22:55:39
DONE TO OUTREACH TO MORE PEOPLE.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 22:55:45
>> THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION,
COUNCILMEMBER.
IT

[Captioner] 22:55:48
 WAS SLOW TO BUILD UP TO
CAPACITY

[Captioner] 22:55:51
 TO GET THE WORD OUT
BECAUSE ONE OF THE BEST WAYS

[Captioner] 22:55:54
 TO
GET INFORMATION OUT TO MANY


[Captioner] 22:55:57
UNSHELTERED COMMUNITY MEMBERS IS
THROUGH WORD OF MOUTH AND
EXPERIENCE WITH

[Captioner] 22:56:00
 THE PROGRAM
HEARING FROM THEIR PEERS AND


[Captioner] 22:56:04
THEIR SUCCESSES OF A PROGRAM, SO
WE ARE

[Captioner] 22:56:07
 NOW -- WE ARE NOT AT
CAPACITY BUT WE CONTINUE TO
RECEIVE

[Captioner] 22:56:10
 REFERRALS ALMOST DAILY.


[Captioner] 22:56:14
WE DO OUTREACH TO CENTRAL PARK


[Captioner] 22:56:17
IN PARTICULAR, AREAS WHERE WE
KNOW THERE ARE GROUPS OF

[Captioner] 22:56:20
 PEOPLE
WHO ARE LIVING IN VEHICLES, SO
WHEN

[Captioner] 22:56:23
 THERE IS AN ABATEMENT
IDENTIFIED AT A CERTAIN PLACE,
WE WILL ALSO

[Captioner] 22:56:26
 DO OUTREACH AND
NOTIFY PEOPLE ABOUT THE SAFE


[Captioner] 22:56:29
PARKING PROGRAM FOR THOSE WHO
ARE ELIGIBLE.


[Captioner] 22:56:33
UNDERSTAND THAT THE ELIGIBILITY
FOR SAFE

[Captioner] 22:56:38
 PARKING DOESN'T FIT
THE -- MAY NOT FIT THE

[Captioner] 22:56:41
 MAJORITY
OF PEOPLE WHO ARE LIVING IN
VEHICLES AND THAT RIGHT NOW


[Captioner] 22:56:44
WE'RE NOT ABLE TO -- WE DON'T
HAVE THE CAPACITY TO TAKE RVs,
SO WE'RE

[Captioner] 22:56:48
 WORKING WITH PEOPLE IN
PASSENGER VEHICLES.
THEY HAVE

[Captioner] 22:56:51
 TO BE CONSISTENTLY
OPERABLE AND THEY DO HAVE TO GET
ON AND

[Captioner] 22:56:54
 OFF THE SITE DAILY, AND
THEN

[Captioner] 22:56:57
 MOVE ACROSS THE CITY MONTH
TO MONTH AT THE DIFFERENT

[Captioner] 22:57:01
 SITES,
AND SOME PEOPLE DECIDE TO OPT
OUT FROM CERTAIN

[Captioner] 22:57:04
 SITES IF THEY
FEEL IT'S TOO FAR TO

[Captioner] 22:57:07
 DRIVE ON A
NIGHTLY BASIS.
GAS, AS WAS MENTIONED

[Captioner] 22:57:11
 EARLIER IN
THIS MEETING, CAN STILL BE A
COST BURDEN TO MANY PEOPLE.


[Captioner] 22:57:14
SO THERE'S MANY FACTORS THAT GO
INTO

[Captioner] 22:57:17
 THE DECISION-MAKING OF WHY
SOMEONE WOULD CHOOSE

[Captioner] 22:57:21
 TO
PARTICIPATE IN A PROGRAM, BUT WE
DO

[Captioner] 22:57:25
 CONSIST TENT OUTREACH AND
ABATEMENT ACTIVITIES FOR THIS


[Captioner] 22:57:27
PROGRAM.
>> Councilmember Kassan: SO IF
WE'RE NOW AT CAPACITY, ARE HE


[Captioner] 22:57:30
WITH ACTUALLY HAVING TO TURN
PEOPLE AWAY OR IS THERE

[Captioner] 22:57:33
 THE
POTENTIAL THAT WE WILL HAVE TO
TURN PEOPLE

[Captioner] 22:57:39
 AWAY?
>> THERE IS THE POTENTIAL.
IT IS

[Captioner] 22:57:42
 A VERY MUCH DYNAMIC WAIT
LIST AS WE ARE WORKING WITH
PEOPLE TO

[Captioner] 22:57:46
 FIND MORE APPROPRIATE
ALTERNATIVES TO EXIT THE PROGRAM
AND THEN WE CAN BRING

[Captioner] 22:57:49
 IN OTHERS
WHO HAVE WAITED, BUT IT'S
DEFINITELY

[Captioner] 22:57:52
 A POTENTIAL THAT
WE'LL HAVE TO TURN PEOPLE

[Captioner] 22:57:57
 AWAY.
>> Councilmember Kassan: THANK
YOU.


[Captioner] 22:58:00
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
LAURIE, IF YOU COULD CLARIFY, I
THINK WE ALSO

[Captioner] 22:58:03
 PARTNER WITH SOME
OF OUR SURROUNDING CITIES IN THE
SOUTH

[Captioner] 22:58:06
 COUNTY, IN PARTICULAR, TO
HELP WITH SOME OF THE OTHER SAFE


[Captioner] 22:58:10
PARKING, AND I BELIEVE UNION
CITY IS ALSO PARTNERING WITH US


[Captioner] 22:58:13
IN THIS EFFORT.
>>

[Captioner] 22:58:17
 YES, ABSOLUTELY, WE WORK WITH
THEM TO MAKE REFERRALS

[Captioner] 22:58:20
 INTO
THEIR CARAVAN PROGRAM, WHICH IS
A SIMILAR

[Captioner] 22:58:23
 MODEL.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
AND I

[Captioner] 22:58:25
 THINK THAT'S IT FOR
CLARIFYING QUESTIONS AT THIS
TIME.


[Captioner] 22:58:28
I THINK WE'RE GOING TO TURN TO
THE PUBLIC AND SEE --

[Captioner] 22:58:31
 WE HAVE
SOME SPEAKERS ON THIS ITEM.
>> Ms. Gauthier: 

[Captioner] 22:58:35
WE CURRENTLY
HAVE THREE SPEAKERS AT THIS

[Captioner] 22:58:37

TIME.
HOW MUCH TIME ARE YOU ALLOTTING


[Captioner] 22:58:41
PER SPEAKER?


[Captioner] 22:58:44
>> Mayor Mei: THREE MINUTES
EACH.


[Captioner] 22:58:52
>> Ms. Gauthier: SORRY, WE NOW
HAVE FIVE SPEAKERS.


[Captioner] 22:58:55
FIRST SPEAKER IS CHRIS.


[Captioner] 22:58:59
>> Mayor Mei: WELCOME, CHRIS.
>> THANK YOU.
AND I'LL

[Captioner] 22:59:02
 TRY AND TAKE LESS THAN
MY ALLOTTED TIME SO YOU GUYS CAN
MOVE

[Captioner] 22:59:05
 ALONG.
SO SOME OF THE THINGS I HEARD

[Captioner] 22:59:08
 IN
THIS PRESENTATION WERE ABOUT
RVs ARE

[Captioner] 22:59:12
 NOT OKAY IN SAFE
PARKING.
A

[Captioner] 22:59:15
 LOT OF PEOPLE UNDER LOWER
BUDGETS HAVE FLED TO

[Captioner] 22:59:18
 RVs TO
TRY AND STILL HAVE

[Captioner] 22:59:22
 A HOME, AND
YOU GUYS JUST CAN'T EXCLUDE
THEM.


[Captioner] 22:59:25
YOU NEED TO FIND A PLACE FOR
THEM.


[Captioner] 22:59:30
THEY ALSO WENT THROUGH AND DID


[Captioner] 22:59:37
NUMBERS, I THOUGHT IT WAS

[Captioner] 22:59:42
 VERY
UNKUSCH FOR YOU GUYS TO SAY TO


[Captioner] 22:59:45
PUT BOULDERS IN FRONT OF TESLA
WAS FOR FIRE SAFETY.
YOU GUYS

[Captioner] 22:59:48
 NOTED THAT 3.5% OF THE
POLICE CALLS WERE FOR IT,

[Captioner] 22:59:57
 RIGHT?
BUT NO ONE EVER SAYS LIKE WHAT
PERCENT OF

[Captioner] 23:00:00
 THE MONEY THAT IS.
YOU KNOW?
AND IF I LOOK AT

[Captioner] 23:00:04
 NON-OVERTIME
MONEY, YOU

[Captioner] 23:00:08
 KNOW, THE CITY SPENDS
APPROXIMATELY 84,000

[Captioner] 23:00:11
 LAST YEAR
ON PEOPLE

[Captioner] 23:00:14
 TO HAVE POLICE

[Captioner] 23:00:19

OFFICERS -- 3% OF THAT IS 2 1/2
MILLION.


[Captioner] 23:00:22
SO THE 3% POLICE CALLS IS NOT


[Captioner] 23:00:25
NOT, YOU KNOW, A COST -- THE
MONEY, AND IT ALSO

[Captioner] 23:00:28
 MEANS THAT
CALLS FOR OTHER SERVICES ARE


[Captioner] 23:00:32
DELAYED, WHICH IS THE BIGGER
PROBLEM.
AND IF YOU GUYS

[Captioner] 23:00:35
 WILL NOT FUND
THE POLICE AT A VERY HIGH
PERCENTAGE

[Captioner] 23:00:38
 FOR OUR POPULATION,
THEN YOU SHOULD AT LEAST FREE


[Captioner] 23:00:41
THEM UP SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO
DEAL WITH HOMELESS ISSUES.


[Captioner] 23:00:45
YOU CAN'T ASK THEM TO DO BOTH.
THAT'S REALLY UNFAIR.


[Captioner] 23:00:51
AND, I STILL SEE NO PLACE THE
CITY

[Captioner] 23:00:54
 HAS PROPOSED FOR SAFE


[Captioner] 23:00:59
PARKING -- I MADE A PUBLIC
INFORMATION ACT REQUEST ASKING
FOR

[Captioner] 23:01:02
 ALL PLACES THE CITY HAD
LOOKED

[Captioner] 23:01:05
 AND PROPOSED FOR SAFE
LOCATION.
I GOT A

[Captioner] 23:01:09
 RESPONSE OF NONE.
SO I REALLY DON'T THINK YOU GUYS
HAVE DONE ANYTHING TO LOOK

[Captioner] 23:01:13
 AT
SAFE PARKING IF THE CITY HAS
LOOKED

[Captioner] 23:01:16
 AT ZERO SAFE PARKING
LOCATIONS WHEN SOMEONE PUTS

[Captioner] 23:01:19
 IN A
PUBLIC RECORD

[Captioner] 23:01:23
 REQUEST THAT'S
OVER -- PROBABLY AT THIS POINT
IT'S

[Captioner] 23:01:26
 OVER 30 DAYS OLD.
SO IT'S NOT LIKE THEY HAVEN'T
HAD TIME TO ANSWER THE QUESTION.


[Captioner] 23:01:30
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 23:01:35
>> Ms. Gauthier: NEXT SPEAKER IS
BLAIR BEEKMAN.
BLAIR

[Captioner] 23:01:37
 BEEKMAN.
>> HI.
BLAIR BEEKMAN HERE.


[Captioner] 23:01:41
THANKS A LOT

[Captioner] 23:01:44
 FOR OFFERING


[Captioner] 23:01:48
3 MINUTES PUBLIC COMMENT TIME.
FIRST OFFER

[Captioner] 23:01:51
 A CLARIFICATION FROM
A COUNCILPERSON WHO

[Captioner] 23:01:54
 SPOKE THAT I


[Captioner] 23:01:57
MISUNDERSTOOD THAT IT WAS MAJOR
BAY AREA CITIES THAT

[Captioner] 23:02:00
 HAD THE
INCREASE IN

[Captioner] 23:02:04
 POLICE WAGES

[Captioner] 23:02:07
 IN
2021, AND YOU HOPEFULLY
CORRECTED THE

[Captioner] 23:02:10
 SITUATION WELL AND
THAT FREMONT IS ACTUALLY IN A
RATE

[Captioner] 23:02:14
 FREEZE.
SO WITH THAT SAID, I JUST WANTED


[Captioner] 23:02:17
TO -- I HAD SPOKEN OF HOMELESS


[Captioner] 23:02:21
ISSUES IN ITEMS AT THE BEGINNING
OF THE MEETING TONIGHT, AND JUST
TO

[Captioner] 23:02:25
 CLARIFY A BIT AND REMIND THE
IMPORTANCE

[Captioner] 23:02:29
 OF WHAT MIXED INCOME
IDEAS COULD HELP WITH FOR


[Captioner] 23:02:33
OURSELVES, I HOPE WE CAN REALLY
FOCUS ON THE IDEAS OF VERY LOW


[Captioner] 23:02:36
AND EXTREMELY LOW INCOME IDEAS,
AND IT'S THOSE

[Captioner] 23:02:39
 CONCEPTS WITH THE
HELP OF MIXED INCOME

[Captioner] 23:02:42
 THAT CAN
CONNECT OURSELVES ON HOW TO


[Captioner] 23:02:46
BUILD HOUSING THAT CONNECTS VERY
LOW

[Captioner] 23:02:49
 WITH THE MODERATE AND LOW
INCOME

[Captioner] 23:02:52
 HOUSING GROUPS.
THOSE ARE PLANS THAT ARE SET

[Captioner] 23:02:55
 TO
BE PUT INTO

[Captioner] 23:02:58
 PLACE IN A MOTION IN
THE LATE 2020s HERE

[Captioner] 23:03:02
 IN
CALIFORNIA OR AT LEAST IN THE
BAY

[Captioner] 23:03:08
 AREA.
BUT IT'S MY FEELING WHY DON'T WE
REALLY START TALKING ABOUT THOSE


[Captioner] 23:03:11
THINGS NOW SO WE CAN REALLY KILL
THE SOIL AND GET

[Captioner] 23:03:14
 OURSELVES
READY.
THE MORE WE GET READY NOW,


[Captioner] 23:03:17
THINGS WILL BE MUCH EASIER TO
TALK ABOUT

[Captioner] 23:03:20
 IN, SAY, A YEAR OR
TWO, LIKE 2025.
AND I JUST

[Captioner] 23:03:24
 THINK IT'S A REALLY
IMPORTANT FUTURE THAT MIXED
INCOME

[Captioner] 23:03:27
 OFFERS OURSELVES ON HOW
TO VIEW

[Captioner] 23:03:30
 THE FUTURE OF OUR
HOUSING.
I THINK

[Captioner] 23:03:33
 IT'S MORE DEMOCRATIC AND


[Captioner] 23:03:38
IT'S MORE -- IT'S A SHARING OF
RESPONSIBILITY, AND WE

[Captioner] 23:03:41
 HAVE TO
LEARN HOW TO ACCEPT IT.
I

[Captioner] 23:03:45
 THINK WE UNDERSTAND IT AND WE
PRACTICE IT SOMETIMES, BUT MAYBE


[Captioner] 23:03:48
NOT AS MUCH AS WE'D LIKE TO.
SO

[Captioner] 23:03:51
 GOOD LUCK IN THOSE EFFORTS
AND THE OVERALL EFFORTS

[Captioner] 23:03:55
 TO
ADDRESS THE CONCEPTS

[Captioner] 23:03:58
 OF HEALTH
AND HUMAN SERVICES AND RACIAL


[Captioner] 23:04:01
EQUITY, BEFORE THE CONCEPTS OF
MORE AND MORE LAW ENFORCEMENT
AND

[Captioner] 23:04:04
 TECHNOLOGY.
AND OF COURSE OPEN PUBLIC POLICY
AND ACCOUNTABILITY WORK THAT

[Captioner] 23:04:08
 I
DO, YOU KNOW, CAN REALLY HELP
NAVIGATE AND

[Captioner] 23:04:11
 ORGANIZE HOW TO
ADDRESS SUCH

[Captioner] 23:04:15
 QUESTIONS, AND JUST
AN OVERALL GOOD LUCK THAT THESE


[Captioner] 23:04:18
ARE THE CONCEPTS TO FOCUS ON
THAT

[Captioner] 23:04:21
 CAN BE PROGRESSIVE GOOD
WAYS AND NOT FEEL LIKE WE'RE
JUST

[Captioner] 23:04:24
 CREATING MISERY.
I THINK THERE'S

[Captioner] 23:04:28
 SOMETHING
THAT -- TO ADDRESS OUR HUMAN
RIGHTS

[Captioner] 23:04:30
 CONCERNS.
GOOD LUCK HOW WE CAN DO THAT IN
THE NEXT YEAR.


[Captioner] 23:04:33
THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN TRYING TO
OFFER, AND GOOD LUCK

[Captioner] 23:04:36
 WITH THIS
SORT OF ITEM AND ITS

[Captioner] 23:04:38
 ISSUES.
THANK YOU.
>> Ms. Gauthier: NEXT SPEAK SER


[Captioner] 23:04:42
LISA DANZ.
>> GOOD EVENING.
THANK

[Captioner] 23:04:45
 YOU.
FIRST I WANT TO AGREE WITH CHRIS
FOR POINTING OUT

[Captioner] 23:04:48
 THAT THE
BOULDERS AT KATO WAS A VERY
HARSH

[Captioner] 23:04:51
 PROGRAM AND WE SHOULD CALL
IT WHAT IT IS.
I ALSO AGREE WITH HOW HE POINTED


[Captioner] 23:04:54
OUT THAT RVs NEED SOMEWHERE TO
PARK AND WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS
IN

[Captioner] 23:04:58
 PREVIOUS CITY COUNCIL
MEETINGS, THE PROPOSED IDEA FOR
THAT IS

[Captioner] 23:05:01
 A CITY-OWNED SAFE
PARKING LOT AND IF I REMEMBER


[Captioner] 23:05:04
CORRECTLY FROM WHEN THIS CAME UP
INITIALLY LIKE A YEAR AND A HALF


[Captioner] 23:05:07
AGO, COUNCIL DIRECTED STAFF TO
ONLY PROCEED WITH THE

[Captioner] 23:05:10
 VERY
LIMITED HOST SITE PROGRAM AND
NOT YET PROCEED WITH THE OTHER


[Captioner] 23:05:13
PRONGS OF THE SAFE PARKING
PROGRAM.
I THINK IT'S HIGH TIME TO MOVE


[Captioner] 23:05:16
FORWARD WITH THE OTHER PRONGS
AND I WOULD LIKE TO SEE COUNCIL


[Captioner] 23:05:19
EXPLICITLY DIRECT STAFF TO
PROCEED WITH

[Captioner] 23:05:22
 CREATING A
CITY-OWNED LOT THAT WOULD
ACCOMMODATE MORE PEOPLE


[Captioner] 23:05:25
INCLUDING RVs, INOPERABLE
VEHICLES AND FAMILIES WITH


[Captioner] 23:05:29
CHILDREN.
MORE SPECIFICALLY ABOUT

[Captioner] 23:05:32
 THIS
PARTICULAR REPORT, I'M A LITTLE
BIT CONCERNED THAT THE


[Captioner] 23:05:35
STATISTICS WITHOUT

[Captioner] 23:05:40
 CONTEXT THAT
DEMONIZE THE COMMUNITY MAKING IT
SOUND LIKE THE UNHOUSED FOLKS


[Captioner] 23:05:43
CAUSE ALL OF THESE PROBLEMS
WITHOUT ACTUALLY TALKING ABOUT
WHAT PROPORTION OF

[Captioner] 23:05:46
 ISSUES SUCH
AS ILLEGAL DUMPING ARE CAUSED BY


[Captioner] 23:05:50
UNHOUSED INDIVIDUALS VERSUS
OTHER INDIVIDUALS,

[Captioner] 23:05:53
 SUCH AS
HOUSED INDIVIDUALS OR
BUSINESSES.


[Captioner] 23:05:56
AND ALSO I'M NOT SURE IF YOU
HAVE A GOOD

[Captioner] 23:06:00
 SENSE OF HOW MUCH OF
THE TRASH NEAR ENCAMPMENTS IS


[Captioner] 23:06:03
ACTUALLY PRODUCED BY THE LOCAL
UNHOUSED RESIDENTS VERSUS

[Captioner] 23:06:06
 DUMPED
BY OTHER PEOPLE WHO FEEL LIKE AN


[Captioner] 23:06:10
ENCAMPMENTMENT IS A GOOD PLACE
TO DUMP THEIR STUFF.
I DON'T KNOW IF THOSE

[Captioner] 23:06:11
 QUESTIONS
ARE OUT OF THE SCOPE OF THE
RESEARCH.


[Captioner] 23:06:15
IF THEY ARE I WOULD URGE THE
COUNCIL TO KEEP IN MIND THERE IS
AN

[Captioner] 23:06:18
 UNMEASURED BUT STILL


[Captioner] 23:06:21
SIGNIFICANT PROPORTION OF
ACTIVITIES SUCH AS ILLEGAL
DUMPING CARRIED OUT BY OTHER


[Captioner] 23:06:24
PEOPLE THAT ARE NOT JUST CARRIED
OUT BY OUR UNHOUSED RESIDENTS.


[Captioner] 23:06:29
AND SORT OF IN THE SAME VEIN

[Captioner] 23:06:32
 OF
CONCERN ABOUT HOW THIS REPORT
SEEMS

[Captioner] 23:06:35
 TO INCLUDE SOME ELEMENTS
OF DEMONIZING OUR UNHOUSED


[Captioner] 23:06:38
NEIGHBORS, IT TALKS ABOUT THE,
QUOTE-UNQUOTE, IMPACTS OF THE
HOMELESS

[Captioner] 23:06:41
 ON THE CITY'S BUSINESS
COMMUNITY.
BUT IT DOESN'T TALK ABOUT THE


[Captioner] 23:06:45
IMPACTS OF DECADES WORTH OF, YOU
KNOW,

[Captioner] 23:06:49
 NIMBY HOUSING POLICY ON
LOAT

[Captioner] 23:06:52

LOW INCOME COMMUNITY AND I THINK
WE NEED TO

[Captioner] 23:06:55
 BE FAIR AND NOTE THAT
THE IMPACTS GO BOTH

[Captioner] 23:06:58
 WAYS.
AND FINALLY, I WOULD SAY AS
YOU'RE COMPARING

[Captioner] 23:07:02
 WITH OTHER
CITIES'

[Captioner] 23:07:05
 STRATEGIES, I WOULD
IMPLORE YOU TO FAVOR THOSE WHO


[Captioner] 23:07:08
PRIORITIZE THE HUMANITY OF THE
UNHOUSED INDIVIDUALS.
FOR EXAMPLE, THE CITY OF


[Captioner] 23:07:11
BERKELEY CONSIDERING SHELTER
AVAILABILITY MAKES SENSE

[Captioner] 23:07:13
 BECAUSE
THAT'S COMING -- LOOKING THROUGH
THE LENS OF PUTTING YOURSELF IN


[Captioner] 23:07:17
THE SHOES OF AN UNHOUSED
INDIVIDUAL

[Captioner] 23:07:20
 AND WHAT
OPPORTUNITIES DO THEY HAVE, AND
IN CONTRAST, I THINK SAN JOSÉ


[Captioner] 23:07:23
SOUNDS PRETTY HARSH WITH HOW
THEY SORT OF BLANKET,

[Captioner] 23:07:27
 PROHIBIT
ANY SORT OF ENCAM MMENT WITHIN
150 FEET OF PUBLIC

[Captioner] 23:07:30
 FACILITIES.
SO THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SAY.


[Captioner] 23:07:33
PLEASE CONSIDER THE HUMANITY OF
OUR UNHOUSED NEIGHBORS.
THANK

[Captioner] 23:07:39
 YOU.
>> Ms. Gauthier: NEXT SPEAKER IS


[Captioner] 23:07:43
MARIE.
>> GREETINGS.
THIS IS MARIE HUGHES, LONG TIME


[Captioner] 23:07:46
RESIDENT OF FREMONT, AND A
MEMBER OF FREMONT FOR EVERYONE

[Captioner] 23:07:49
 I
KNOW THAT THE -- THAT THIS
COUNCIL CARES ABOUT THE

[Captioner] 23:07:51

HOMELESS.
I'VE SEEN THAT WITH THE VOTES TO


[Captioner] 23:07:54
START A SAFE PARKING PROGRAM, TO
APPLY

[Captioner] 23:07:57
 FOR A PROJECT HOMEKEY
GRANT, AND TO BUILD A HOUSING
NAVIGATION

[Captioner] 23:08:02
 CENTER.
HOWEVER, I REMAIN FRUSTRATED
WITH THE CURRENT STATE OF THE


[Captioner] 23:08:05
UNHOUSED HERE IN FREMONT.
THIS

[Captioner] 23:08:08
 YEAR'S POINT IN TIME COUNT
SHOWS THAT THE HOMELESS
POPULATION HAS

[Captioner] 23:08:11
 ACTUALLY FALLEN
IN A FEW CITIES IN THE AREA, BUT
IN OUR CITY, HAS

[Captioner] 23:08:15
 RISEN.
TO BE HONEST, I FIND THAT A BIT
EMBARRASSING, AND I THINK WE


[Captioner] 23:08:19
SHOULD BE ABLE TO BETTER THAN A
CITY LIKE

[Captioner] 23:08:22
 SAN FRANCISCO, WHICH
HAS MANY, MANY MORE PROBLEMS
THAN WE

[Captioner] 23:08:25
 DO.
GIVEN THE SUCCESS OF THESE OTHER
CITIES, I HOPE THERE ARE PLANS


[Captioner] 23:08:28
TO REACH OUT TO THEM

[Captioner] 23:08:30
 TO FIND OUT
WHAT THEY DID AND HOW IT COULD
APPLY TO FREMONT.


[Captioner] 23:08:34
WE ALSO HAVE NOT HAD ANY VISIBLE
PROGRESS

[Captioner] 23:08:37
 TOWARDS A CITY
SPONSORED SAFE PARKING PROGRAM
THAT WOULD SERVE

[Captioner] 23:08:40
 A WIDER RANGE
OF PARTICIPANTS, SUCH AS
FAMILIES AND

[Captioner] 23:08:43
 PEOPLE IN RVs AS
HAS BEEN MENTIONED, WHICH

[Captioner] 23:08:46
 OUR
CURRENT PROGRAM DOES NOT ALLOW.
IN ADDITION, I

[Captioner] 23:08:49
 SEE THE CITY
ENGAGING IN THE SAME GAME

[Captioner] 23:08:53
 OF HOT
POTATO THAT OTHER CITIES DO.
I'M REFERRING TO CLEANING OUT

[Captioner] 23:08:56
 A
HOMELESS ENCAMPMENT IN ONE AREA,


[Captioner] 23:08:59
THOSE HOMELESS PEOPLE MOVE TO
ANOTHER AREA, A MONTH LATER,
THEY GET

[Captioner] 23:09:02
 CLEARED OUT FROM THERE,
THEY MOVE AGAIN, AND THIS
HAPPENS OVER AND OVER.


[Captioner] 23:09:05
JUST MOVING THE UNHOUSED FROM
ONE PART OF THE CITY TO

[Captioner] 23:09:09
 ANOTHER
IS NOT A SOLUTION, AND I THINK
WE CAN ALL AGREE ON THAT.


[Captioner] 23:09:15
I KNOW FREMONT CAN DO BETTER AND
I LOOK FORWARD TO THE CREATION
OF THE HOMELESS

[Captioner] 23:09:18
 WORKING GROUP
AND TO SEE SOME REAL PROGRESS
TOWARDS A BETTER SAFE PARKING


[Captioner] 23:09:22
PROGRAM, AND OTHER PROVEN
SOLUTIONS THAT WILL GET OUR
UNHOUSED

[Captioner] 23:09:24
 RESIDENTS INTO
PERMANENT HOUSING.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 23:09:32
>> Ms. Gauthier: THE LAST
SPEAKER IS

[Captioner] 23:09:37
 KATHERINE.
>> HI.
I'M

[Captioner] 23:09:40
 HAVING  COMPUTER ISSUES

[Captioner] 23:09:43
 SO IF
I GET CUT OFF I JUST HAVE TO
WRITE YOU A LETTER.


[Captioner] 23:09:45
ALL RIGHT.
FIRST I WANT TO THANK
COUNCILMEMBER SHAO FOR HIS


[Captioner] 23:09:50
CONCERN ABOUT ENSURING THAT
LOCAL RESIDENTS IN FREMONT WHO
ARE

[Captioner] 23:09:54
 UNHOUSED GET PRIORITY ON
HOUSING LISTS, AND I WOULD

[Captioner] 23:09:57
 HOPE
THAT YOUR WORK WOULD ALSO BE
INCLUDED BECAUSE THEY SEEM TO BE


[Captioner] 23:10:01
VERY CLOSELY RELATED CITIES WITH
FREMONT

[Captioner] 23:10:04
 SURROUNDING NEWARK AND
MOST OF

[Captioner] 23:10:09
 NEWARK'S MEDICAL CARE,
SHOPPING AND OTHER BUSINESSES IN


[Captioner] 23:10:15
FREMONT, AND IN FACT I AM
WANTING TO TRANSITION FROM
NEWARK TO FREMONT BECAUSE

[Captioner] 23:10:18
 THAT
IS EXACTLY WHERE ALL MY

[Captioner] 23:10:20
 BUSINESS
IS AND I NEED BETTER
TRANSPORTATION AVAILABLE TO ME


[Captioner] 23:10:23
BECAUSE I NO LONGER DRIVE.
I WOULD

[Captioner] 23:10:26
 ALSO

[Captioner] 23:10:32
 LIKE TO

[Captioner] 23:10:36
 SEE THAT
LOCAL RESIDENTS GIVE -- BE

[Captioner] 23:10:39
 GIVEN
A HIGHER NUMBER

[Captioner] 23:10:42
 OF UNITS AS
PRIORITY THAN ARE CURRENTLY
GIVEN.


[Captioner] 23:10:46
THEY SEEM TO BE GIVEN A SMALL
NUMBER, WHEREAS THE LARGER


[Captioner] 23:10:49
NUMBER IS GIVEN TO LOTTERY, AND
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT CHANGE
BECAUSE WE

[Captioner] 23:10:52
 DO HAVE A VERY
SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM

[Captioner] 23:10:55
 HERE IN
FREMONT.


[Captioner] 23:10:59
IN ADDITION, THIS TOPIC HAS BEEN
BROUGHT UP

[Captioner] 23:11:02
 A COUPLE OF TIMES NOT
JUST BY ME BUT

[Captioner] 23:11:05
 OTHERS AS WELL.
AND I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT


[Captioner] 23:11:08
THAT I BELIEVE

[Captioner] 23:11:11
 THAT I AM BEING
REMOVED FROM CONSIDERATION FOR
HOUSING BECAUSE I CURRENTLY HAVE


[Captioner] 23:11:14
AN ADDRESS, AND IT IS IMPOSSIBLE
ON AN

[Captioner] 23:11:17
 APPLICATION TO INDICATE
WHY I'M

[Captioner] 23:11:21
 SEEKING A DIFFERENT
ADDRESS.
IN FACT, I'M LIVING

[Captioner] 23:11:24
 IN A UNIT
WHERE I HAVE A SLUM

[Captioner] 23:11:27
 LANDLORD,
AND MY UNIT WAS

[Captioner] 23:11:30
 METHAMPHETAMINE
CONTAMINATED BY THE PREVIOUS RES
TENT WHO WAS A

[Captioner] 23:11:34

RESIDENT WHO WAS A DRUG DEALER
AND

[Captioner] 23:11:37
 I'VE BEEN HAVING ONGOING
RESPIRATORY

[Captioner] 23:11:41
 ISSUES, AND THIS HAS
BEEN AFFECTING OTHER HEALTH
ISSUES THAT I HAVE, AND IT

[Captioner] 23:11:44
 WOULD
BE REALLY NICE IF I WAS NOT


[Captioner] 23:11:47
OVERLOOKED SIMPLY BY THE FACT
THAT I HAVE

[Captioner] 23:11:51
 AN ADDRESS WHEN I
HAVE EXTENUATING

[Captioner] 23:11:54
 CIRCUMSTANCES.
SO IF THERE IS ANY CONTROL ON
YOUR PART IN

[Captioner] 23:11:57
 TERMS OF QUESTIONS
THAT ARE ASKED, I WOULD REALLY


[Captioner] 23:12:00
LOVE TO SEE A QUESTION ON THE
APPLICATION FORM THAT

[Captioner] 23:12:04
 ASKS WHY
YOU'RE WANTING TO MOVE FROM ONE
ADDRESS TO

[Captioner] 23:12:08
 ANOTHER SO THAT
EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES CAN BE
TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION.


[Captioner] 23:12:15
AND I THINK MY LAST POINT IS
THAT I WOULD

[Captioner] 23:12:18
 LIKE TO THANK JENNY
KASSAN FOR ACKNOWLEDGING

[Captioner] 23:12:21
 MY
COMMENTS IN REGARDS TO
MITIGATION, AND FOR


[Captioner] 23:12:25
ACKNOWLEDGING THAT HOMELESS
FOLKS DO ACTUALLY HAVE

[Captioner] 23:12:28
 IDEAS.
WE'VE LIVED THIS.
AND WE HAVE GREAT

[Captioner] 23:12:31
 INSIGHTS IN
HOW INEFFICIENT THINGS

[Captioner] 23:12:34
 ARE IN
OUR SYSTEM.
I PERSONALLY HAVE A

[Captioner] 23:12:37
 LOT OF
IDEAS, AND THAT ALSO INCLUDES
SAVING

[Captioner] 23:12:40
 TAXPAYERS MONEY.


[Captioner] 23:12:47
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
I'LL BRING IT BACK TO THE
COUNCIL FOR COMMENTS AT THIS


[Captioner] 23:12:50
TIME.
AND

[Captioner] 23:12:53
 COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, IS
THAT FROM BEFORE OR THIS IS NEW?
>> Councilmember Kassan: 

[Captioner] 23:12:56
THIS IS
NEW.


[Captioner] 23:13:01
YEAH, SO IT'S OBVIOUS THAT THE
COSTS FOR

[Captioner] 23:13:05
 THE, QUOTE-UNQUOTE,
MITIGATION IS GOING UP


[Captioner] 23:13:08
INCREDIBLY HIGH.
AND ADDRESSING

[Captioner] 23:13:11
 THE ROOT CAUSES
OF THE PROBLEM WOULD BE A

[Captioner] 23:13:15
 MUCH
MORE FINANCIALLY RESPONSIBLE
THING TO DO, AND IF

[Captioner] 23:13:18
 YOU LOOK AT
THE THINGS THAT WE ARE CURRENTLY


[Captioner] 23:13:21
DOING, THERE'S A REALLY HIGH
RATE OF SUCCESS IN

[Captioner] 23:13:24
 TERMS OF
PEOPLE WHO ARE COMING

[Captioner] 23:13:30
 INTO THE
PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE AND ARE
ACTUALLY GETTING

[Captioner] 23:13:33
 PLACED IN
PERMANENT AFFORDABLE HOUSING.
I'M TRYING TO FIND

[Captioner] 23:13:36
 THOSE NUMBERS
HERE IN THE REPORT AND I CAN'T
FIND THEM RIGHT NOW.


[Captioner] 23:13:41
BUT THEY'RE ACTUALLY INCREDIBLY
HIGH.
IT'S KIND

[Captioner] 23:13:44
 OF -- THEY'RE WORKING
MIRACLES, PEOPLE WHO ARE COMING
INTO

[Captioner] 23:13:47
 THE SAFE PARKING PROGRAM
AND THE HOUSING

[Captioner] 23:13:50
 NAVIGATION
CENTER, THEY ACTUALLY --

[Captioner] 23:13:53
 LARGE
NUMBERS ARE GETTING PLACED IN
PERMANENT AFFORDABLE HOUSING.


[Captioner] 23:13:57
AND THE FACT -- I'M REALLY
THRILLED TO HEAR THAT MORE AND
MORE PEOPLE ARE

[Captioner] 23:14:01
 TAKING ADVANTAGE
OF OUR SAFE PARKING PROGRAM, AND


[Captioner] 23:14:04
I DO JUST -- I WAS LOOKING BACK
OVER THE

[Captioner] 23:14:07
 YEARS OF DISCUSSIONS
ABOUT SAFE PARKING, AND

[Captioner] 23:14:11
 IT FIRST
CAME UP IN 2018, BEFORE I WAS ON


[Captioner] 23:14:14
THE COUNCIL, AND IT NEVER REALLY
CAME UP AGAIN.
SO I

[Captioner] 23:14:18
 BROUGHT A REFERRAL IN 2020
TO ASK FOR AN UPDATE

[Captioner] 23:14:21
 ON IT, AND
I WAS TOLD AT THAT TIME, WELL,
WE JUST HAVEN'T

[Captioner] 23:14:25
 REALLY BEEN ABLE
TO FOCUS ON IT BECAUSE WE'VE
BEEN SO

[Captioner] 23:14:28
 FOCUSED ON THE HOUSING
NAVIGATION CENTER.
AND

[Captioner] 23:14:31
 THEN FINALLY WE DID GET A
REPORT FROM STAFF

[Captioner] 23:14:34
 WITH
RECOMMENDATIONS AND A MAJORITY
OF THE COUNCIL DECIDED TO

[Captioner] 23:14:37
 ONLY
MOVE FORWARD WITH ONE OF THE
THREE

[Captioner] 23:14:42
 RECOMMENDATIONS.
IT'S NOW FOUR YEARS

[Captioner] 23:14:46
 LATER, AND
THERE'S DEFINITELY A NEED

[Captioner] 23:14:49
 TO
GROW OUR PROGRAMS AND WE ALREADY


[Captioner] 23:14:52
HAVE AN EXCELLENT RECOMMENDATION
THAT CAME

[Captioner] 23:14:55
 TO US OVER A YEAR AGO
FOR

[Captioner] 23:14:58
 PROVIDING ADDITIONAL SAFE
PARKING.
SO I THINK WE SHOULD

[Captioner] 23:15:02
 REALLY MOVE
FORWARD WITH THAT.
WE HAVE A WINDFALL

[Captioner] 23:15:05
 THAT HAS COME
TO US, WE COULD USE SOME OF THAT
MONEY FOR THAT.


[Captioner] 23:15:08
IT'S BEEN REALLY EFFECTIVE AND
IT IS -- WE'RE GETTING TO

[Captioner] 23:15:11
 A
POINT NOW WHERE WE ARE HAVING TO
POTENTIALLY TURN

[Captioner] 23:15:14
 PEOPLE AWAY
FROM THE CURRENT PROGRAM.
SO THAT'S WHAT I WOULD LOVE

[Captioner] 23:15:17
 TO
SEE HAPPEN AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
AND NOT

[Captioner] 23:15:20
 WAIT MORE YEARS TO START
TO IMPLEMENT THIS.
WE

[Captioner] 23:15:24
 REALLY -- IT IS AN URGENT
SITUATION AND THE COST

[Captioner] 23:15:27
 OF
MITIGATION IS GETTING HIGHER AND
HIGHER, AND IT'S

[Captioner] 23:15:31
 REALLY JUST --
EVERYONE

[Captioner] 23:15:34
 IS UPSET, NOBODY WANTS
TO BE SUBJECT TO MITIGATION,
NOBODY WANTS TO BE

[Captioner] 23:15:36
 FORCED OUT OF
WHERE THEY'RE LIVING BECAUSE
PEOPLE ARE COMPLAINING ABOUT


[Captioner] 23:15:40
THEM OR HAVING FENCES BUILT
BECAUSE PEOPLE

[Captioner] 23:15:44
 DON'T LIKE TO SEE
THOSE FOLKS AROUND.
THE

[Captioner] 23:15:47
 BEST SOLUTION IS TO HELP
PEOPLE GET INTO

[Captioner] 23:15:48
 PERMANENT
AFFORDABLE HOUSING.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 23:15:56
>> Mayor Mei: SO I WANTED TO,
ONE, THANK EVERYONE FOR THE
REPORT AND

[Captioner] 23:15:59
 FOR THE SPEAKERS WHO
HAVE MADE THE COMMENTS.


[Captioner] 23:16:02
I THINK THAT'S WHY ORIGINALLY
WHEN WE TALKED ABOUT THE BEST


[Captioner] 23:16:05
WAY TO HOUSE PEOPLE IS TO


[Captioner] 23:16:08
PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING AND
THAT'S WHY WE SUBMITTED
ORIGINALLY THE

[Captioner] 23:16:12
 PROJECT HOMEKEY,
WHICH UNFORTUNATELY DID NOT

[Captioner] 23:16:15
 GET
APPROVED FOR FUNDING, AND THAT I


[Captioner] 23:16:18
WANTED TO NOTE THAT AS YOU
RECALL, FROM

[Captioner] 23:16:21
 BOTH THE
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE
NAVIGATION CENTER,

[Captioner] 23:16:24
 THE
CONVERSATIONS THAT WE'VE HAD
ABOUT PROJECT

[Captioner] 23:16:29
 HOMEKEY, AND WHEN
WE HAD OUR HOMELESSNESS STUDY,
WE

[Captioner] 23:16:32
 DID LOOK AND I

[Captioner] 23:16:35
 APOLOGIZE IF
IT WASN'T GIVEN TO ONE OF THE


[Captioner] 23:16:39
SPEAKERS WHO REQUEST -- I
REMEMBER WE HAD LOOKED AT SAFE


[Captioner] 23:16:42
PARKING SITES AND THERE WERE
DIFFERENT LOCATIONS THAT WE HAD
LOOKED

[Captioner] 23:16:46
 AT THROUGHOUT THE
DISTRICT, AND CERTAINLY THERE
ARE SOME PLACES THAT

[Captioner] 23:16:49
 HAVE CITY
PROPERTIES, BUT I THINK THAT
THAT'S

[Captioner] 23:16:52
 WHY, YOU KNOW, WHEN WE
LOOK AT SAFE PARKING, WE WERE


[Captioner] 23:16:55
FOCUSING ON OUR NEXT PIECE WAS
HOPEFULLY GOING TO BE THE
PROJECT

[Captioner] 23:16:59
 HOMEKEY IN TERMS OF THE
PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE

[Captioner] 23:17:01
 HOUSING
WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN A VERY
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF HOUSING IF


[Captioner] 23:17:04
IT HAD PASSED, AND THAT WILL BE
STILL SUBMITTED HOPEFULLY FOR
ROUND THREE,

[Captioner] 23:17:08
 WHICH IS IN MARCH.


[Captioner] 23:17:12
AND PERHAPS WE'LL BE LOOKING AT
DIFFERENT PROPERTIES.
I THINK THAT WHEN IT

[Captioner] 23:17:16
 COMES TO
THE POINT IN TIME COUNT, I ALSO
WANTED TO ADDRESS THAT FOR

[Captioner] 23:17:19
 SOME
OF THE SPEAKERS.


[Captioner] 23:17:22
LAURIE, I APOLOGIZE I'LL PUT YOU
A LITTLE ON SPOT HERE, BUT I
RECALL WHEN WE HAD

[Captioner] 23:17:26
 THE COVID
RESPONSIVENESS, WE HAD A LARGE
FACILITY THAT WAS

[Captioner] 23:17:29
 UTILIZED FOR
FOUR CITIES.
IT WAS

[Captioner] 23:17:32
 THE SPRING HILL SUITES IN
NEWARK, AND I

[Captioner] 23:17:36
 KNOW THAT -- I
DON'T KNOW IF THAT WAS STILL IN
OPERATION AT THAT TIME,

[Captioner] 23:17:39
 BUT I
KNOW THAT WE HAD SHARED

[Captioner] 23:17:42
 RESOURCE
BETWEEN FREMONT, UNION CITY,
NEWARK AND HAYWARD, AND DO

[Captioner] 23:17:45
 YOU
KNOW, I MEAN, HOW MANY UNITS
THAT WAS AND HOW MUCH THE


[Captioner] 23:17:49
OCCUPANCY WAS UTILIZED?
I THINK IT WAS FULLY UTILIZED


[Captioner] 23:17:52
ACTUALLY, IF I RECALL, IN OUR
WEEKLY -- OR

[Captioner] 23:17:55
 OUR BI-WEEKLY
UPDATES.
>> THANK YOU, MAYOR.


[Captioner] 23:17:58
YES, THAT PROGRAM WAS FULLY


[Captioner] 23:18:03
UTILIZED.
IT WAS A -- I'M GOING TO MIX UP
ALL

[Captioner] 23:18:07
 THESE PROJECT -- PROJECT
ROOM KEY, AND THERE

[Captioner] 23:18:09
 WERE
MULTIPLE ROOM KEY SITES
THROUGHOUT THE COUNTY.


[Captioner] 23:18:13
THE SPRING HILL SUITES WAS THE
ONLY ONE SERVING

[Captioner] 23:18:17
 SOUTH COUNTY.
AND I APOLOGIZE, I

[Captioner] 23:18:20
 DON'T RECALL
THE NUMBER OF UNITS, BUT IT

[Captioner] 23:18:23
 WAS
FULLY

[Captioner] 23:18:27
 UTILIZED, AND THEY WORKED
REALLY HARD TO

[Captioner] 23:18:30
 RELOCATE PEOPLE
PRIOR TO THE CLOSURE.
>> Mayor Mei: DO YOU KNOW

[Captioner] 23:18:33
 WHEN
IT CLOSED?


[Captioner] 23:18:39
>> I WANT TO SAY JULY 2021.


[Captioner] 23:18:42
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY.
BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THAT'S ONE
OF THE THINGS I WAS TRYING

[Captioner] 23:18:45
 TO
FIGURE OUT, IS HOW MUCH WAS IT
STILL BEING HOUSED IN THAT.


[Captioner] 23:18:48
I KNOW THAT THAT'S ONE OF THE
THINGS THAT WE ARE LOOKING AT IN
LONGER TERM

[Captioner] 23:18:54
 SOLUTIONS, AND I
KNOW THE COUNCIL WHEN WE

[Captioner] 23:18:56
 HAD
THIS CONVERSATION AGAIN, WE
LOOKED AT CITY-OWNED PROPERTY


[Captioner] 23:19:00
SITES AND PRIORITIZED BASED OFF
LOCATION SIMILAR TO

[Captioner] 23:19:03
 WHAT WE DID
FOR THE HNC, AND THERE ARE
CERTAIN SITES THAT

[Captioner] 23:19:06
 ARE LARGE
ENOUGH.
THERE ARE VERY FEW THAT WOULD

[Captioner] 23:19:08
 BE
LARGE ENOUGH FOR SAFE PARKING
FOR RVs.


[Captioner] 23:19:12
AND I THINK SOME OF THEM, YOU
MAY BE FAMILIAR WITH, AND I
THINK

[Captioner] 23:19:15
 THIS WOULD REQUIRE MORE OF
AN AGENDIZED -- BECAUSE THERE IS
A REPORT AT

[Captioner] 23:19:18
 THIS TIME, BUT THERE
ARE SITES THAT

[Captioner] 23:19:22
 ARE OFF OF -- BUT
THEN THERE'S ALSO THE
REQUIREMENT FOR PEOPLE TO

[Captioner] 23:19:25
 HAVE
ACCESS TO SERVICES, AND SO
THAT'S WHY ORIGINALLY

[Captioner] 23:19:28
 THIS HNC,
WHEN ALL THINGS WERE

[Captioner] 23:19:31
 BROUGHT AND
I'M SURE PEOPLE WILL BE WRITING
US FROM THIS

[Captioner] 23:19:34
 MEETING, AND WE HAD
THIS CONVERSATION MANY YEARS
AGO.


[Captioner] 23:19:37
WE HAD LOOKED AT SEVERAL
DIFFERENT CITY PROPERTY SITES
THAT WERE

[Captioner] 23:19:40
 LARGE ENOUGH FOR THIS
AND

[Captioner] 23:19:45
 UNFORTUNATELY IT WAS VERY
VOCAL, AT IN THE

[Captioner] 23:19:48
 END, IT ENDED
UP BEING LOCATED HERE AT CITY
HALL.


[Captioner] 23:19:51
AND I THANK COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN
FOR RECOGNIZING THIS, BUT WE'VE
HAD AN

[Captioner] 23:19:56
 INCREDIBLE RESPONSE AND
SUCCESS RATE.
WE'VE BEEN HOUSING

[Captioner] 23:19:59
 I THINK
ROUGHLY, IF I REMEMBER
CORRECTLY, ABOUT 71% OF

[Captioner] 23:20:01
 THE
PEOPLE.
THERE WILL BE A TWO-YEAR REPORT


[Captioner] 23:20:04
COMING OUT, BUT 71% OF THE
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFULLY


[Captioner] 23:20:08
HOUSED AND I CAN HONESTLY SAY I
COME HERE AT ALL DIFFERENT

[Captioner] 23:20:11
 HOURS
OF THE MORNING AND NIGHT, AND
IT'S LOCATED AT

[Captioner] 23:20:14
 CITY HALL, AND
COULD YOU MENTION TO ME, I

[Captioner] 23:20:17
 THINK
WHEN WE DID THE STUDY FOR THE
PROJECT HOMEKEY, WE ACTUALLY


[Captioner] 23:20:22
COMPARED THE ISSUES WITH ANY
POLICE REPORTS OR

[Captioner] 23:20:25
 CRIMES, AND
OUR HOMEKEY, AS WELL AS THE
ISLANDER, WHICH IS RIGHT NOW


[Captioner] 23:20:29
ACTUALLY BEING BUILT FOR LOW
INCOME HOUSING AND RENOVATED
RIGHT

[Captioner] 23:20:33
 NOW, HAD THE LOWER RATE
THAN THE OTHER SITE

[Captioner] 23:20:36
 THAT WE WERE
LOOKING AT FOR THE PROJECT
HOMEKEY, IS THAT

[Captioner] 23:20:39
 CORRECT?
I DON'T HAVE CHIEF WASHINGTON
ONLINE RIGHT NOW,

[Captioner] 23:20:42
 BUT I REMEMBER
THAT VIVIDLY.


[Captioner] 23:20:47
BECAUSE I HAVE SEEN AT LEAST
HERE AT THE CITY HALL,

[Captioner] 23:20:51
 AND I'VE
COME AT MANY DIFFERENT TIMES OF
THE DAY AND ALSO HAVE BEEN

[Captioner] 23:20:54
 OVER
THERE, I HAVE TO SAY THAT I'M
VERY PROUD OF THE

[Captioner] 23:20:57
 FACT THAT IT
HAS BEEN A FACILITY THAT HAS
BEEN WELL UTILIZED AND

[Captioner] 23:21:02
 HOPEFULLY
AS THE PANDEMIC RESTRICTIONS
EASE, THAT

[Captioner] 23:21:05
 WE CAN HAVE MORE
PEOPLE UTILIZING THAT PROGRAM.
WE

[Captioner] 23:21:09
 HAD SOME PHYSICAL SPACE
DISTANCING REQUIREMENTS

[Captioner] 23:21:12
 BY
HEALTH BECAUSE OF THE COVID
REQUIREMENTS AT THAT TIME.


[Captioner] 23:21:17
BUT LAURIE, COULD YOU MENTION IF
THERE IS -- I THINK

[Captioner] 23:21:21
 THE TWO-YEAR
REPORT IS COMING OUT SOON.
>>

[Captioner] 23:21:26
 YES, THEY'LL BE PROVIDING A
TWO-YEAR UPDATE

[Captioner] 23:21:29
 ON THE HOUSING
NAVIGATION CENTER.
>> Mayor Mei: SO I

[Captioner] 23:21:32
 NOLL THAT ONE
OF THE THINGS THAT SOME OTHER
CITIES HAVE DONE IS THEY'VE PUT


[Captioner] 23:21:35
HOUSING NAVIGATION CENTERS IN
MULTIPLE PLACES AND SOME OF THEM
HAVE ACTUALLY

[Captioner] 23:21:39
 BEEN REJECTED
AFTER THEY WERE APPROVED

[Captioner] 23:21:44
 IN
OTHER PARTS OF THEIR CITY, SO


[Captioner] 23:21:47
THIS IS A REPORT OUT AND I DO
AGREE THERE HAS BEEN A
SIGNIFICANT

[Captioner] 23:21:53
 IMPACT ON -- WE'VE
SEEN QUITE A FEW FIRES, WE'VE
SEEN QUITE A FEW ISSUES

[Captioner] 23:21:56
 WITH THE
TRASH MITIGATION, AND I DO HAVE
TO

[Captioner] 23:21:59
 SAY, I KNOW IT'S NOT TO
CRIMINALIZE PEOPLE OR TO

[Captioner] 23:22:03
 PUT
THIS -- BUT I THINK THERE IS AN
IMPACT AND I THINK

[Captioner] 23:22:06
 IN PARTICULAR
ON OUR PUBLIC FACILITIES, WE
WANT TO BALANCE THE

[Captioner] 23:22:09
 FACT THAT AS
PEOPLE ARE RETURNING TO UTILIZE
THE FACILITIES, WE WANT TO MAKE


[Captioner] 23:22:13
SURE IT'S ACCESSIBLE, AND SOPART OF

[Captioner] 23:22:16
 OUR MASTER PARK PLAN AND
OTHER THINGS IS WE WANT TO MAKE
SURE OUR FACILITIES

[Captioner] 23:22:19
 ARE
ACCESSIBLE, SO THAT'S A
PARTNERSHIP WITH THE

[Captioner] 23:22:22
 COUNTY, AND
IT ALLOWS US THEN TO UTILIZE
SOME OF THEIR

[Captioner] 23:22:25
 MATCHING FUNDS AND
HOPEFULLY WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT
THESE

[Captioner] 23:22:29
 PROCESS, I KNOW LAURIE,
THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE LEAD
AND

[Captioner] 23:22:32
 BEING OUR SPOKESPERSON ON
THE HOMELESSNESS

[Captioner] 23:22:35
 WORKING GROUP.
SO JUST TO CLARIFY, THE
HOMELESSNESS WORKING

[Captioner] 23:22:38
 GROUP IS A
MEETING OF SOME OF THE DIFFERENT


[Captioner] 23:22:41
STAFF MEMBERS WITHIN THE OTHER
CITIES, AND WE MEET ON A

[Captioner] 23:22:45
 MONTHLY
BASIS, AND THAT'S BEFORE THE


[Captioner] 23:22:48
ALAMEDA COUNTY MAYORS CONFERENCE
MEETING EVERY TIME, AND I

[Captioner] 23:22:52
 KNOW
THAT SUZANNE SHENFIL, WHO'S OUR
DIRECTOR,

[Captioner] 23:22:54
 AND LAURIE HAVE BEEN
PARTICIPATING, AS WELL AS OTHER
STAFF MEMBERS.


[Captioner] 23:22:57
SO WE ARE CONSTANTLY LOOKING AT
THE DIFFERENT OPTIONS.


[Captioner] 23:23:01
I THINK THAT BY HAVING

[Captioner] 23:23:04
 US MOVE
FORWARD IN TERMS OF TRYING TO
BUILD A

[Captioner] 23:23:07
 HOMELESSNESS MASTER
PLAN, AS WELL AS LOOKING AT SAFE
PARKING

[Captioner] 23:23:12
 SITE, IS THE RIGHT
DIRECTION TO GO.
I WOULD BE SUPPORTIVE

[Captioner] 23:23:15
 OF THAT,
AND I KNOW THAT THERE WILL BE
PLENTY OF COMMUNITY

[Captioner] 23:23:19
 FEEDBACK AND
WE'LL HAVE TO DO OUTREACH BEFORE
WE PUT

[Captioner] 23:23:22
 THAT IN.
I ALSO SEE THAT WE HAVE
COUNCILMEMBER

[Captioner] 23:23:25
 JONES WHO WOULD
LIKE TO ADD TO THAT COMMENT,
BECAUSE I KNOW

[Captioner] 23:23:29
 PERHAPS HE HAS
SOME GREAT INSIGHTS FOR BEING AN


[Captioner] 23:23:32
RV USER AND OTHER PERSPECTIVES,
SO I WOULD LOVE TO SEE US
UTILIZE

[Captioner] 23:23:35
 THAT.
>> Councilmember Jones: YEAH,
ACTUALLY I THINK

[Captioner] 23:23:38
 THAT'S
SOMETHING IN THE INTEREST OF
TIME AND IN THE FACT THAT WE


[Captioner] 23:23:41
HAVE A HARD STOP TIME OF 11:30,


[Captioner] 23:23:45
I WOULD LIKE TO ACCEPT THE
REPORT AND, YOU

[Captioner] 23:23:48
 KNOW, STAFF IS
GOING TO BE COMING BACK WITH A


[Captioner] 23:23:51
HOMELESSNESS RESPONSE MASTER
PLAN AND I THINK THAT WOULD BE
THE APPROPRIATE TIME FOR THE


[Captioner] 23:23:54
CONVERSATION ABOUT ALL OF OUR
OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO

[Captioner] 23:24:01
 US.
WITH REGARD TO THE RVs, IT
DOES BECOME CHALLENGING, AND IT


[Captioner] 23:24:04
IS GOING TO REQUIRE SOME SPECIAL
SERVICES FOR THAT.


[Captioner] 23:24:07
SO -- BUT I WOULD RECOMMEND THAT
WE MOVE THIS ITEM FORWARD SO


[Captioner] 23:24:10
THAT WE CAN ABIDE BY OUR HARD
STOP TIME.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 23:24:13
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY.
MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER

[Captioner] 23:24:14
 JONES,
SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER
SALWAN.


[Captioner] 23:24:21
AND COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN --
>> Councilmember Kassan: YEAH, I
DO HAVE A

[Captioner] 23:24:22
 CLARIFYING QUESTION
BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE I'M HEARING
TWO DIFFERENT THINGS.


[Captioner] 23:24:26
WHAT I HAD UNDERSTOOD IS THAT


[Captioner] 23:24:28
THERE WASN'T ANY EFFORT BEING
PUT INTO

[Captioner] 23:24:32
 IMPLEMENTING THE SECOND
AND THIRD

[Captioner] 23:24:35
 PRONGS OF THE SAFE
PARKING RECOMMENDATIONS BECAUSE
THE

[Captioner] 23:24:38
 MAJORITY OF THE COUNCIL HAD
SAID TO JUST FOR NOW FOCUS ON
JUST ONE OF

[Captioner] 23:24:41
 THEM.
BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE SAYING
THAT THERE HAS BEEN

[Captioner] 23:24:45
 SOME
EXPLORATION OF LOCATION, SO I
WAS WONDERING IF

[Captioner] 23:24:48
 I COULD HEAR
FROM STAFF SOME

[Captioner] 23:24:51
 CLARIFICATION ON
WHAT ACTIONS HAVE BEEN

[Captioner] 23:24:54
 TAKEN ON
THE OTHER PRONGS OF THE -- YOU
KNOW,

[Captioner] 23:24:58
 THE PRONGS OF HAVING AN
ACTUAL LOCATION THAT

[Captioner] 23:25:01
 IS OWNED BY
THE CITY FOR SAFE PARKING.
HAS ANY

[Captioner] 23:25:04
 WORK BEEN DONE ON THAT?

[Captioner] 23:25:07
AT ALL SINCE YOU RECEIVED THE
DIRECTION FROM COUNCIL TO ONLY


[Captioner] 23:25:10
FOCUS ON THE HOSTED SITES?


[Captioner] 23:25:17
>> Ms. Briggs: LAURIE CAN
EXPANDS ON THIS BUT I BELIEVE
THE ANSWER WAS NO.


[Captioner] 23:25:20
THERE WAS SOME PRELIMINARY
INFORMATION DELIVERED TO THE
CITY COUNCIL WHEN THE DIFFERENT


[Captioner] 23:25:23
OPTIONS WERE LAID OUT AND AT
THAT TIME, CITY COUNCIL ELECTED
TO JUST

[Captioner] 23:25:27
 GO WITH THE SINGLE
PRONG.


[Captioner] 23:25:32
>> Councilmember Kassan: SO
GIVEN THAT THERE HAVE BEEN A


[Captioner] 23:25:36
COUPLE OF OPINIONS EXPRESSED
THAT MAYBE NOW WOULD BE A GOOD
TIME TO

[Captioner] 23:25:39
 START THAT PROCESS SINCE
WE KNOW IT TAKES A VERY

[Captioner] 23:25:41
 LONG
TIME.
WOULD IT BE APPROPRIATE TO ASK


[Captioner] 23:25:45
THAT STAFF START TO FOCUS ON
THAT NOW INSTEAD OF HAVING

[Captioner] 23:25:51
 TO
WAIT FOR A WHOLE PLANNING
PROCESS TO BE DONE SINCE WE'VE


[Captioner] 23:25:54
BEEN WAITING QUITE A WHILE?
>> Mayor Mei: 

[Captioner] 23:25:57
I BELIEVE THIS
AGENDA ITEM THIS EVENING IS TO
ACCEPT

[Captioner] 23:26:00
 THE REPORT.
I KNOW THAT IN THE

[Captioner] 23:26:03

CONVERSATIONS, AND I WON'T SPEAK
FOR LAURIE ON THIS, BUT I KNOW


[Captioner] 23:26:07
THAT THIS HAS BEEN SOMETHING
THAT HAS BEEN

[Captioner] 23:26:11
 DISCUSSED AT THE
HOMELESSNESS WORKING GROUP, AND
THAT

[Captioner] 23:26:14
 THERE ARE INTEREST IN
PURSUING THOSE

[Captioner] 23:26:19
 OPTIONS, SHOULD
THE FUNDING AND SOME OF THESE
OPTIONS BECOME AVAILABLE.


[Captioner] 23:26:22
SO IT'S NOT THAT WE AREN'T
CONSIDERING THESE AT ALL.


[Captioner] 23:26:26
SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE --
BECAUSE IN FAIRNESS, THIS IS


[Captioner] 23:26:29
WHAT'S AGENDIZED THIS EVENING.
WE DON'T

[Captioner] 23:26:33
 HAVE AGENDIZED OTHER
ACTIONS.
SO I SEE

[Captioner] 23:26:36
 A MOTION BY
COUNCILMEMBER JONES AND A SECOND
BY COUNCILMEMBER

[Captioner] 23:26:39
 SALWAN.
SO PLEASE VOTE.


[Captioner] 23:26:49
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: THROUGH
THE CHAIR.
YOU DON'T TECHNICALLY NEED TO


[Captioner] 23:26:50
VOTE ON --
>> Councilmember Kassan: YEAH, I
WAS CONFUSED.


[Captioner] 23:26:54
>> Mayor Mei: SORRY, MY
APOLOGIZE BECAUSE IT'S JUST A
REPORT, THAT'S RIGHT.


[Captioner] 23:26:57
SO I DON'T NEED TO VOTE.
I APOLOGIZE, IT'S GETTING LATE
FOR ME

[Captioner] 23:27:00
 TOO AND EVERYONE ELSE.
BUT SO I

[Captioner] 23:27:03
 WOULD AT LEAST SUPPORT
THE IDEA OF HAVING THIS


[Captioner] 23:27:07
CONVERSATION, AND SO I THINK
THAT PERHAPS WHEN WE RECEIVE THE


[Captioner] 23:27:10
REPORT, I KNOW THAT, LAURIE, YOU
JUST MENTIONED EARLIER

[Captioner] 23:27:13
 WE'RE
GOING TO BE GETTING A REPORT FOR
THE HOMELESS NAVIGATION

[Captioner] 23:27:17
 CENTER,
AND ALSO I THINK THERE'S A
REPORT ON THE ISLANDER

[Captioner] 23:27:20
 AND ALSO
AT THAT TIME PERHAPS WE COULD
AGENDIZE THIS

[Captioner] 23:27:23
 FOR FUTURE
DISCUSSION.
SO WITH THAT, THANK YOU FOR


[Captioner] 23:27:26
JOINING US THIS EVENING.
I'M NOT GOING TO

[Captioner] 23:27:29
 GO INTO ANY
OTHER THINGS AT THIS TIME, AND
SO I'D LIKE TO SAY THE MEETING


[Captioner] 23:27:32
IS ADJOURNED BEFORE ON
