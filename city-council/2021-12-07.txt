19:14:24  OUT THERE TO BE CAREFUL, BECAUSE THE
19:14:28  NATURE IS A VERY VOLATILE FORCE.
THANK
19:14:31  YOU FOR PROVIDING THIS RESOURCE.
AT THIS TIME, I KNOW AT
19:14:34  7:15 WE HAVE TO OPEN THE PUBLIC HEARING, AND SO I WANTED TO MAKE

19:15:22  INTRODUCTION AND KRISTEN PARKS WHO IS A CONSULTANT WITH NATIONAL
19:15:25  DEMOGRAPHICS CORPORATION WILL PROVIDE A PRESENTATION.
WELCOME
19:15:28 .

19:15:33 >> THANK YOU, MAYOR MEI, GOOD EVENING
19:15:36 .
AS MENTIONED, WE
19:15:39  ARE HOSTING OUR SECOND REDISTRICTING PUBLIC HEARING HERE AT THE CITY OF FREMONT
19:15:42 .
REALLY LOOKING TO GET THE PUBLIC
19:15:46  PUBLIC'S ENGAGEMENT IN THIS PROCESS AS WELL AS TO
19:15:49  NOW REVIEW ITEMS
19:15:53  AND PUBLIC COMMENT, MAPS THAT WERE SUBMITTED
19:15:56  TO THE CITY OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS, AND REVIEW THEM
19:15:59  AMONGST THE COUNCIL HERE
19:16:03  TONIGHT.
JUST A LITTLE OVERVIEW, OVER THE PAST FEW MONTHS, THE CITY
19:16:07  HAS DONE PUBLIC OUT
19:16:11 REACH THROUGHOUT FREMONT.

19:16:14 WITH A STRONG EMPHASIS ON REACHING OUR COMMUNITIES WHO
19:16:17  ARE NON-ENGLISH SPEAKERS, ALL OF OUR DOCUMENTS
19:16:20  FROM OUR PAST HOSTED MEETINGS AND GOING
19:16:24  FORWARD TO TONIGHT HAVE BEEN TRANSLATED INTO EIGHT LANGUAGES
19:16:27 .
MANY OF WHICH ARE POPULAR HERE IN
19:16:30  FREMONT.
WE HAVE POSTED
19:16:33  THESE NOTICES AND
19:16:37  ADS IN VARIOUS ETHNIC MEDIA NEWSPAPERS ACROSS THE
19:16:40  BAY AREA, AND WHICH SERVICE FREMONT.
WE
19:16:43  HAVE ALSO OPENED UP A
19:16:47  SURVEY THAT IS OPEN TO OUR RESIDENTS AND WE'VE RECEIVE
19:16:50 ED OVER 30 RESPONSES, WHICH IS GOING TO BE
19:16:53  VERY HELPFUL TO OUR COUNCIL AND MOVING
19:16:56  FORWARD IN THIS PROCESS, WHERE WE HAVE RECEIVED
19:16:59  FEEDBACK ABOUT OUR RESIDENTS
19:17:03 ' COMMUNITY OF INTEREST, THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS, WHAT BRINGS THEM
19:17:06  TOGETHER, AND THESE VARIOUS COMMUNITIES, NEIGHBORHOODS
19:17:10 , RELIJ, LOCATION, E
19:17:13  RELIGION, LOCATION, WE WILL
19:17:16  BE GOING INTO MORE OF THAT TONIGHT.
WE DID OUTREACH AND HAD
19:17:19  SIX PUBLIC MAPS SUBMITTED ELECTRONICALLY.
THREE OF THEM WILL BE REVIEWED
19:17:22  TONIGHT, AND THE CONSULTANT WILL EXPLAIN
19:17:26  FURTHER WHY ALL SIX AREN'T GOING TO BE REVIEWED TONIGHT.

19:17:30 SO WE REALLY WILL CONTINUE THIS PUBLIC OUT
19:17:33 REACH.
WE ARE ENCOURAGING RESIDENTS TO STILL RESPOND TO THE
19:17:36  SURVEY, WHICH WILL BE OPEN
19:17:40  THROUGH THE END OF JANUARY 2022.
WE ARE ALSO
19:17:43  STILL ACCEPTING  MAPS,
19:17:46  DRAFT MAPS LEX
19:17:53  ELECTRONICALLY WHICH ARE AVAILABLE
19:17:58  ONLINE AND AT ALL COMMUNITY CENTERS AND LIBRARY.

19:18:01 SO THAT PUBLIC OUTREACH IS STILL A BIG IMPORTANCE OF THIS  PROCESS, AND IT WILL
19:18:06  CONTINUE THROUGH APRIL 2022.

19:18:11 WITH THAT, I WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT THAT OUR OUTSIDE
19:18:14  COUNSEL, TRICIA ORTIZ, AS WELL AS DEBRA MARGOLIS
19:18:18  ARE HERE ON THE MEETING TONIGHT IF THERE ARE ANY LEGAL  QUESTIONS.

19:18:22 AND SO I WOULD LIKE TO TURN IT OVER, KRISTEN
19:18:25  PARKS IS OUR USUAL CONSULTANT
19:18:29  ON THIS PROJECT.
SHE'S ACTUALLY AT A  REDISTRICTING HEARING FOR MARIN
19:18:32  COUNTY SO SHE'LL BE ON LATER, SO WE'LL HAVE
19:18:36  KEN
19:18:42  CHALKINS GIVE US A PRESENTATION.
LIKE IN THIS STAFF REPORT,
19:18:45  YOU WILL NOTICE SOME OF THIS INFORMATION IS
19:18:48  REPEATED, BUT WE ARE OPEN AND HOPING THAT NEW
19:18:51  MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC ARE  JOINING US HERE TONIGHT AND GETTING INVOLVED IN THIS
19:18:54  PROCESS.
SO I'M GOING TO TURN IT OVER TO KEN
19:18:58 .
>> GREAT, THANK YOU, AMANDA,
19:19:01  THANK YOU, MAYOR, MEMBERS OF COUNCIL.

19:19:04 APOLOGIES, I'M THE UNUSUAL CONSULTANT.
AMANDA, AM I
19:19:08  SHARING MY SCREEN AND SHOWING FROM HERE?
IS THAT THE BEST WAY TO DO IT
19:19:11  OR ARE YOU GOING TO CLICK THROUGH?
>> SURE, IF YOU COULD.
>> I'LL
19:19:14  SHARE A SCREEN.
OKAY.

19:19:19 I JUST WANT TO SAY WHAT IS GOING ON AT NDC, BUT IT'S REALLY
19:19:22  IMPORTANT FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC AND PARTICULARLY THE PUBLIC
19:19:25  SERVANTS WHO ARE SERVING.
THIS IS
19:19:29  MADNESS GOING ON ACROSS THE COUNTRY.
COVID HAS
19:19:32  DELAYED A LOT OF THE DATA, IT CAME IN LATE.

19:19:35 WE CAN TALK ABOUT THAT LATER, BUT IT IS THIS PROCESS
19:19:38  OF  REDRAWING THE MAPS IS HAPPENING IN EVERY JURISDICTION
19:19:42  IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

19:19:45 AND IT FEELS VERY PAROCHIAL BECAUSE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT YOUR LIST, BUT
19:19:48  IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT IS REALLY THE FUNDAMENTAL
19:19:51  ELEMENT OF A DEMOCRACY.
YOU'RE DRAWING THE PLACES
19:19:55  WHERE FOLKS ARE REPRESENTING.
AND IT HAPPENS EVERY 10 YEARS.
SO
19:19:58  IT'S QUITE DRAMATIC FOR US ON OUR SIDE TO KIND OF WATCH ALL OF THIS
19:20:01  TUMBLE AROUND IN MANY DIFFERENT JURISDICTIONS.

19:20:04 AND I SUSPECT -- I DON'T KNOW, COUNCILMEMBERS
19:20:07  AND MAYOR, IF YOU ARE HEARING FROM YOUR  COLLEAGUES, A LOT CAN BE LEARN
19:20:10 ED SORT OF FROM ALL THE OTHER
19:20:14  PROCESSES AS WELL.
BUT IT'S REALLY PROFOUND BECAUSE IN THE END, NOW YOU'RE GOING
19:20:18  TO FIND OUT WHERE PEOPLE GET REPRESENTED.
THE JUXTAPOSITION TO THAT, VERY
19:20:21  QUICKLY, AMANDA, YOU SHOULD
19:20:24  BE COMMENDED.
THE SURVEY IS NOT DONE IN VERY MANY PLACES
19:20:27 .
THE OUTREACH IS REALLY HARD.
THIS IS AN OPAQUE
19:20:30  KIND OF SUBJECT MATTER FOR CITIZENS.
THEY UNDERSTAND
19:20:33  A ROAD OR A STOP SIGN.
THIS IS A
19:20:36  HARD ONE TO GET PEOPLE EXCITED ABOUT.

19:20:40 THAT YOU GOT 30 RESPONSES IS REALLY IMPORTANT, SO WE'RE GOING TO GO THROUGH THE
19:20:43  PROCESS HERE.
HOPEFULLY THERE ARE SOME  CITIZENS THAT HAVEN'T HEARD THIS
19:20:46  PRESENTATION AND WE'LL SEE SOME IDEAS AND SOME MAPS
19:20:49  AND WANT TO LEND THEIR VOICES TO THE PROCESS.

19:20:59 I DON'T SEE WHERE I CAN SHARE MY SCREEN.
I CAME IN AS A PARTICIPANT
19:21:02 , AMANDA.
>> Mayor Mei: DO WE HAVE ACCESS
19:21:05  TO THAT, MS. GAUTHIER?
MAYBE WE CAN SHARE FROM OUR  SIDE.

19:21:09 >> OH, I GOT IT.
SORRY.
I GOT IT.

19:21:13 MY APOLOGIES.

19:21:20 EVERYBODY SEE THAT?

19:21:28 OKAY.

19:21:33 THIS IS JUST YOUR CURRENT DISTRICT MAP AND YOU'RE GOING TO SEE WHERE
19:21:36  THIS IS IMPORTANT.
LATER
19:21:39  ON, BUT THIS IS THE CURRENT BOUNDARIES AS THEY EXIST RIGHT NOW.

19:21:45 DRAWN IN 2017,
19:21:48  BECAUSE YOU DID IT INSTEAD OF AT THE CENSUS, YOU DID IT
19:21:52  IN BETWEEN -- IN THE MIDDLE OF A
19:21:56  DECADE FOR A WHOLE HOST OF REASONS.
SO THIS IS RELATIVELY
19:21:59  RECENT.
IT DOESN'T MEAN -- AND YOU'RE GOING TO SEE THE NUMBERS DON'T
19:22:02  CHANGE BECAUSE POPULATIONS DO OVER TIME.

19:22:06 HERE IS AN IMPORTANT TIMELINE.
YOU'RE REQUIRED TO DO AT
19:22:09  LEAST FOUR PUBLIC HEARINGS.
THIS WOULD BE THE SECOND OF
19:22:12  THEM, IN BETWEEN THAT THERE ARE
19:22:16  DIFFERENT EITHER WORKSHOPS  AND/OR OUTREACHES TO DIFFERENT
19:22:19  AUDIENCES, DIFFERENT CITIES OR JURISDICTIONS
19:22:22  DO THIS DIFFERENTLY.
THE IMPORTANT NOTE FOR YOU ALL IS THAT DEADLINE AT THE END
19:22:25  IS APRIL 17TH.
THAT'S WHEN YOU HAVE TO ADOPT
19:22:29  A NEW MAP.
MANY JURISDICTIONS HAVE TO ADOPT BY
19:22:32  DECEMBER 15, SO THEY'RE AT THE END OF THIS PROCESS.
YOU'RE SORT
19:22:35  OF IN THE MIDDLE, BEGINNING, ET CETERA, SO YOU'VE GOT SOME TIME TO
19:22:39  AIR THE SUBJECT OUT.
BY THE WAY, I CAN'T SEE EVERYBODY.

19:22:42 PLEASE JUST JUMP IN AND INTERRUPT IF THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS ALONG
19:22:46  THE WAY.
THIS IS PROBABLY THE
19:22:49  MOST CRITICAL SLIDE FOR THE PUBLIC
19:22:52  TO UNDERSTAND.
IF THERE WERE NO RULES
19:22:55  AND WE COULD JUST DRAW THE MAPS, THAT MIGHT BE ONE WAY TO DO IT,
19:22:58  BUT THERE ARE RULES.
THERE ARE FEDERAL RULES AND THERE ARE STATE
19:23:01  RULES.
IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND HOW THEY OPERATE BECAUSE
19:23:04  WHEN YOU'RE DRAWING MAPS,
19:23:07  YOU HAVE TO BE AWARE OF WHAT THE RULES ARE, OTHERWISE
19:23:11  THEY WON'T PASS  MUSTER.
THE FIRST IS THE
19:23:14  FEDERAL VOTING RIGHTS ACT ON THE LEFT.
THE EQUAL POPULATION
19:23:18  RULE WAS SIMPLY ONE PERSON, ONE VOTE.

19:23:21 IT MAINTAINS THAT.

19:23:25 AS DISTRICTS GROW IN SIZE AND SHAPE, YOU CAN'T HAVE
19:23:28  SOMEBODY IN THE SAME JURISDICTION REPRESENTING MANY MORE
19:23:31  PEOPLE OR FEWER PEOPLE THAN SOMEBODY NEXT TO THEM.

19:23:34 AND SO AS POPULATIONS CHANGE, YOU HAVE TO
19:23:38  ADJUST THE MAP IN AN EQUAL POPULATION.
SO
19:23:41  FOR EXAMPLE, THE EASIEST ONE FOR PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND IS THERE
19:23:44  ARE 435 MEMBERS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
THEY COUNT ALL
19:23:48  OF THE PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES, THEY DIVIDE BY 435
19:23:51  AND THAT'S THE NEW SIZE, THE TARGET SIZE OF A DISTRICT.

19:23:54 THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT IS ALSO REALLY
19:23:57  IMPORTANT AND IT'S A SUBTLE THING TO SAY.
AND
19:24:00  I'LL SHOW YOU WHEN WE GET TO THE NOTES.

19:24:04 THE FEDERAL VOTING RIGHTS ACT SUGS THAT THERE ARE PROTECTED
19:24:08  CLASSES OF PEOPLE, RACIAL, ETHNIC AND LINGUISTIC GROUPS.

19:24:11 YOU CANNOT DRAW LINES THAT DILUTE
19:24:14  THE POTENTIAL FOR THOSE GROUPS TO
19:24:18  ELECT A  REPRESENTATIVE.
IT DOESN'T GUARANTEE ANYTHING, IT
19:24:21  DOESN'T GIVE YOU A NUMBER, IT DOESN'T SAY WHAT THE SPECIFIC NUMB
19:24:24  NUMBER IS, BUT IF
19:24:28  A LINE IS SEEN AS DRAWING TO DILUTE THE
19:24:31  POTENTIAL, THE COURTS WILL LOOK AT THAT AND SAY, NO, YOU'VE EITHER
19:24:35  CRACKED IT, IN OTHER WORDS, YOU'VE SPLIT IT SO THAT THE
19:24:39  TWO DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES -- THEY GO TO TWO DIFFERENT DISTRICTS AND YOU DISALLOW
19:24:42  THEM THE REPRESENTATION, OR YOU CAN ALSO PACK IT.
IF
19:24:45  YOU HAVE ENOUGH PEOPLE IN AN AREA THAT SHOULD
19:24:50  POTENTIALLY -- THE POTENTIAL FOR TWO DISTRICTS AND YOU CARVE
19:24:53  OFF AND YOU PACK EVERYBODY INTO ONE, YOU CAN'T DO
19:24:56  THAT EITHER.
IT'S SUBTLE BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO
19:24:59  UNDERSTAND THAT THAT'S WHAT THE COURTS ARE LOOKING FOR.

19:25:03 THE THIRD, I THINK MOST PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THE
19:25:06  PHRASE GERRYMANDERING, YOU MAY NOT KNOW WHERE IT COMES FROM.

19:25:09 THERE WAS A GOVERNOR NAMED GERRY
19:25:13  AND THEY CREATED A DISTRICT THAT LOOKED LIKE A SAL PLAN DER, AND
19:25:16  SALAMANDER.
HE APPROV
19:25:19 ED THAT MANY, MANY YEARS AGO SO THEY CALLED THAT GERRYMANDERING
19:25:22 .
BUT YOU CANNOT CREATE A DISTRICT THAT'S SPECIFIC FOR A
19:25:25  RACIAL GROUP.
AND THE COURTS WILL LOOK AT IT AND SAY, WELL,
19:25:28  WHAT'S THE LOGIC OF THAT DISTRICT,
19:25:31  AND IF YOU JUST GO AROUND TRYING TO CAPTURE A CERTAIN ETHNIC
19:25:34  OR RACIAL  GROUP, IT BECOMES OBVIOUS AND THEY'LL DISALLOW
19:25:38 .
THAT'S THE FEDERAL SIDE OF THIS
19:25:41  EQUATION.
THAT LITTLE ASTERISK THERE AS
19:25:44  WELL IS
19:25:48  CONNECTED TO THE FIRST
19:25:51  ONE, EQUAL POPULATION.
THE COURTS UNDERSTAND YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET IT
19:25:55  PERFECTLY.
WHAT THEY'VE SAID IS THEY WANT TO ALLOW A MAXIMUM DEVIATION OF
19:25:58  10%.
AND THAT MEANS IF YOUR
19:26:01  LARGEST DISTRICT IS ABOVE 5 AND YOUR SMALL
19:26:04 EST DISTRICT IS BELOW 5%
19:26:07  OF THE TARGET, THAT'S MORE THAN
19:26:11  10 SPREAD, YOU WANT TO STAY AS FAR UNDER THAT 10 AS YOU POSSIBLY
19:26:14  CAN.

19:26:18 IDEALLY YOU'D WANT TO GET EVERY DISTRICT THE SAME SIZE.
BUT YOU KNOW
19:26:21  THERE'S GOING TO BE SOME VARIATION, YOU JUST DON'T WANT TO GO OVER 10% AND
19:26:24  YOU'RE GOING TO SEE, I THINK A GOOD EXAMPLE IN YOUR EXISTING MAPS.

19:26:30 SECONDLY, THE CALIFORNIA FAIR MAPS ACT WHICH WAS PASSED
19:26:33  JUST A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO.
THIS ADDS ANOTHER LAYER AND IT'S
19:26:36  IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND TWO THINGS.
THESE PRIORITIES
19:26:40  ARE LISTED -- THESE CRITERIA ARE LISTED
19:26:43  IN THE ORDER OF PRIORITY.

19:26:46 THEY ARE ALSO INTENDED TO BE ACCOMPLISH
19:26:50 ED WHERE PRACTICABLE
19:26:54 .
YOU CANNOT GET THESE THINGS PERFECT.
IT'S A MIXTURE OF SORT OF
19:26:57  ART AND SCIENCE.
BUT TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU
19:27:00  GO CROSS WAYS ON ONE OF THESE OR THE COURTS SEE THAT YOU DON'T
19:27:03  DO ONE OF THESE, THAT'S WHEN THEY'LL SAY, THIS MAP IS
19:27:06  NOT  VIABLE
19:27:10 .
SO IN ORDER THEY GO LIKE THIS.
CO
19:27:13 NTIGUITY MEANS THE DISTRICTS HAVE TO TOUCH
19:27:16  EACH OTHER.
YOU CANNOT HAVE MAPS THAT ARE COMPLETELY
19:27:19  SEPARATE FROM EACH OTHER.
THAT ONE IS RELATIVELY EASY TO
19:27:22  SEE VISUALLY.
BUT THERE ARE MAPS THAT KIND OF
19:27:25  LOOK LIKE THEY'RE NOT  CONTIGUOUS, AND THEY ARE BY
19:27:29  SLIVERS AS LONG AS YOU HAVE THE RIGHT LOGIC
19:27:33  OF HOW THEY WERE KEPT CONTIGUOUS, YOU'RE
19:27:36  IN GOOD SHAPE.
BUT THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING.

19:27:39 SECONDLY, YOU'LL HEAR THIS TERM
19:27:42  "NEIGHBORHOODS AND COMMUNITIES OF INTEREST."
IF YOU SAID TO
19:27:46  SOMEBODY, WHAT'S A NEIGHBORHOOD, THEY WOULD  CLEARLY
19:27:49  THINK GEOGRAPHY.

19:27:52 MOST PEOPLE DO.
SIMILARLY, IF YOU SAID WHAT'S YOUR COMMUNITY
19:27:55 , THEY WILL THINK GENERALLY COMMUNITY.
BUT I
19:27:58  THINK AMANDA, IN YOUR COMMENTS, YOU POINTED OUT, I WOULD
19:28:02  ENCOURAGE THE PUBLIC AND COUNCIL TO BE THINKING BROADLY
19:28:05 .
IS A COMMUNITY OF INTEREST A SCHOOL
19:28:09  DISTRICT OR SCHOOL ATTENDANCE ZONES, IS
19:28:12  IT SOCIOECONOMIC, IS IT AGE, YOU COULD HAVE A SENIOR
19:28:16  COMMUNITY.
THERE'S ALL SORTS OF WAYS TO
19:28:20  DEFINE COMMUNITY, AND I WOULD ASK YOU TO NOT THINK ABOUT THE
19:28:23  MAP BUT THINK ABOUT THE TERRITORY.
WHERE DO
19:28:27  PEOPLE WORK, WHERE DO THEY PLAY, WHERE DO THEY CONGREGATE,
19:28:30  WHERE DO THEY DO WHAT THEY DO, AND THAT WILL HELP YOU
19:28:33  MOVE TO COMMUNITIES OF INTEREST.

19:28:36 THAT'S THE TERM OF ART THAT'S USED IN THIS PROCESS.
THE THIRD ONE IS
19:28:40  IDENTIFIABLE BOUNDARIES.
THE COURT HAS SAID IT IS VERY,
19:28:43  VERY LEGITIMATE, BOTH EITHER PERSON-
19:28:46 MADE BOUNDARIES LIKE FREEWAYS AND ROADS AND SHOPPING CENTERS AND
19:28:50  ALL KINDS OF THINGS,
19:28:53  OR NATURAL ONES.
IF THERE'S A MOUNTAIN RANGE, IF THERE'S A PARK, IF
19:28:57  THERE'S A GREENWAY.
YOU CAN USE
19:29:01  THOSE IN THE CITY OF FREMONT TO IDENTIFY BOUNDARIES IF THEY
19:29:04  MAKE SENSE.
OFTEN THOSE PLAY VERY WELL WITH COMMUNITIES
19:29:08  OF INTEREST.

19:29:11 AND THE FINAL ONE IS  COMPACTNESS.
IT
19:29:15  SIMPLY MEANS IF THE MAP LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE JUMPING OVER ONE AREA
19:29:18  TO GET TO ANOTHER, THAT STARTS TO LOOK REALLY
19:29:22  UNUSUAL UNLESS YOU HAVE SOME REALLY UNUSUAL LOGIC
19:29:28  OR A LOGIC THAT'S UNIQUE TO YOUR CITY, TO FREMONT.
BUT YOU'D WANT TO
19:29:31  MAKE SURE THAT THE DISTRICTS ARE AS COMPACT AS POSSIBLE, TO STAY
19:29:35  AWAY FROM THIS NOTION OF GERRYMANDERING.

19:29:38 THE LITTLE CHECKMARKS SUGGEST THAT YOU CAN'T DISCRIMINATE, YOU
19:29:41  CAN'T USE POLITICAL PARTY IN FAVOR OF
19:29:45  ONE DISTRICT VERSUS ANOTHER.

19:29:49 THESE OTHER THREE ON THE RIGHT ARE NOT BY LAW, BUT IT
19:29:52  IS THINGS THAT WE USE JUST AS A GUIDE
19:29:55  AND YOU CAN USE THEM OR NOT
19:29:59 .
GENERALLY SPEAKING, IF MEMBERS OF AN ELECTED
19:30:02  BODY ARE ELECTED IN CERTAIN YEARS, YOU WANT TO TRY AND
19:30:05  MAKE SURE NOT ONLY THAT IF THEIR DISTRICT CHANGES AND
19:30:08  THEY MOVE INTO A DIFFERENT DISTRICT, THAT THINGS
19:30:11  DON'T UNDO THEIR
19:30:15  ELECTION CYCLE, WHEN THEY WERE ELECTED FOR.
SIMILARLY,
19:30:18  ELECTED OFFICIALS WERE ELECTED FOR A CERTAIN PERIOD OF TIME.
VOTERS
19:30:21  MADE THAT CHOICE, AND YOU WANT TO TRY AND PRESERVE THAT
19:30:25 .
IF YOU CAN KEEP THE EXIST
19:30:29 ING DISTRICTS AND THEY WORK FOR YOU, I
19:30:32  WOULD SUGGEST YOU DON'T CALL OUT AND SAY, HEY, WE'RE STARTING AND WE WANT
19:30:35  TO MAKE THIS OUR DISTRICT, WE'RE JUST GOING TO NIBBLE
19:30:39 .
YOU'LL SEE NDC HAS PROVIDED A MINIMAL
19:30:42  ADJUSTMENT MAP FOR YOU TO THINK ABOUT AND THINK  THROUGH.

19:30:45 BUT IT IS SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN USE OR NOT.
SOMETIMES
19:30:49  PEOPLE COME IN AND CHANGE MAPS COMPLETELY.

19:30:53 MOST IMPORTANTLY ON THE RIGHT-HAND SIDE, THOSE THREE, THEY'RE NOT REQUIRED BUT IT IS
19:30:56  SOMETHING YOU WANT TO BE SENSITIVE TO.
LET ME STOP THERE AND SEE
19:30:59  IF THERE'S ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS THAT YOU HAVE.

19:31:07 OKAY.
IF NOT, I'LL CONTINUE ON.

19:31:12 THIS IS WITH EACH OF THE MAPS, YOU WILL
19:31:15  SEE THIS KIND OF -- THIS SPREADSHEET
19:31:18 .
YOU SHOULD KNOW, THERE ARE MANY, MANY, MANY MORE
19:31:21  LINES.
THIS COMES FROM THE CENSUS DATA.

19:31:25 WE'VE CUT OUT THESE PARTICULAR ONES BECAUSE WE HAVE FOUND THESE TO BE THE
19:31:28  MOST IMPORTANT TO PEOPLE MAKING THESE DECISIONS.

19:31:31 LET ME POINT OUT TWO ITEMS HERE.
FIRST,
19:31:34  THAT THIRD LINE IS PERCENT DEVIATION
19:31:37 .
SO REMEMBER AT THE
19:31:40  BOTTOM, YOU'LL SEE YOUR TARGET IS
19:31:44  38,441.
THAT IS
19:31:47  -- DIVIDED BY 6.

19:31:51 SO YOU CAN SEE WHERE THE DEVIATION IS IN SOME
19:31:54  DISTRICTS LOW, FOR EXAMPLE,
19:31:59  1 AND 3 AND 5 AND IT'S A LITTLE HIGH IN 2, 4 AND
19:32:02  6.
THAT RED NUMBER ON THE RIGHT SUGGESTS THAT YOU ARE OUTSIDE
19:32:05  OF THE 10% DEVIATION.

19:32:09 AND THAT IS IF YOU ADD THE  HIGHEST OF THE
19:32:13  UPSIDE,  DISTRICT 6, AND THE LOWEST OF THE DOWNSIDE
19:32:16 , DISTRICT 3, YOU'LL
19:32:19  SEE THAT ADDS TO 10.62.

19:32:23 THAT'S AN IMPORTANT NUMBER BECAUSE THAT MEANS YOU'RE OUTSIDE, YOU HAVE
19:32:26  TO DO SOMETHING WITH YOUR CURRENT  MAPS.

19:32:30 SECONDLY, YOU'LL SEE CITIZEN VOTING AGE
19:32:33  POPULATION, AND THESE ARE PROTECTED CLASSES.

19:32:37 HISPANIC, NON-HISPANIC WHITE, NON-HISPANIC
19:32:41  -- AND PACIFIC ISLANDERS.
WHAT'S IMPORTANT ABOUT THIS IS
19:32:44  YOU'LL SEE THE TOTAL POPULATION
19:32:48 , BUT THE CITIZEN VOTING AGE IS THE MOST
19:32:51  IMPORTANT PERCENTAGE THAT YOU'RE AFTER.

19:32:54 WE COULD GIVE YOU A PERCENTAGE THAT IS OF THE WHOLE, BUT INSTEAD
19:32:58  THESE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT CAN VOTE.

19:33:02 AND THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT TO BE LOOKING FOR IN TERMS OF ARE YOU
19:33:05  DILUTING OR CRACKING OR PACKING
19:33:08  A PROTECTED CLASS.

19:33:12 AGAIN SIMILARLY, YOU WANT TO BE CAREFUL OF LANGUAGE THAT SAYS WE'RE
19:33:16  TRYING TO CREATE AN AGENCY
19:33:21  BUT YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE NOT EITHER CRACKING OR PACKING
19:33:24 , DILUTING IN ONE WAY OR ANOTHER.
LET ME STOP AND ASK IF
19:33:27  THERE'S ANY QUESTION THERE.

19:33:32 OKAY.
LET'S KEEP GOING.

19:33:35 I'M CHECKING, BY THE WAY, KRISTEN IS TRYING TO GET OFF
19:33:38  OF HERS AND JOIN HERE AS WELL, SO I'M HAPPY TO DO BOTH.

19:33:42 I EXPLAINED THIS A MOMENT AGO.
THE IDEAL DISTRICT SIZE
19:33:46  IS 38,441, THAT'S YOUR OVERALL POPULATION DIVIDED
19:33:49  BY 6.
THE TOTAL DEVIATION, YOU
19:33:52  SUBTRACT THE LARGEST FROM THE SMALLEST AND THEN THE PERCENT IS THE SAME THING.

19:33:55 THAT'S EXACTLY HOW YOU GET THOSE NUMBERS.

19:34:00 NOW, THIS TERM COMMUNITY OF
19:34:03  INTEREST AND NEIGHBORHOOD IS WHAT WE REALLY WOULD WANT TO
19:34:07  ENGAGE, YOU, THE CITY COUNCIL, AS WELL AS THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY
19:34:11 .
I SHOULD MENTION THAT IN
19:34:14  DRAWING THE MAPS, WE TAKE A LOT OF INFORMATION
19:34:17 .
IF SOMEBODY WANTS TO SUBMIT A FULL MAP, THAT'S GREAT.

19:34:21 IF THEY WANT TO SEND US A NOTE THAT SAYS THESE ARE THE COMMUNITIES I THINK
19:34:24  ARE IMPORTANT OR THE COMMUNITIES OF INTEREST ARE IMPORTANT, THAT'S GREAT AS
19:34:27  WELL.
I WOULD ASK YOU TO BE
19:34:31   THINKING -- ASKING, THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF QUESTIONS THAT
19:34:34  YOU WANT TO ENGAGE YOUR
19:34:38  CONSTITUENTS WITH, AND MAKE SURE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO BE THE ONES MAKING
19:34:42  THE DECISION WHAT IS THE MOST CRITICAL OF
19:34:45  THESE THAT YOU NEED TO TRY AND REPRESENT
19:34:48  IN A MAP.
I BELIEVE YOU'VE
19:34:52  DONE -- YES, IN THE FIRST PUBLIC TESTIMONY, AND I THINK,
19:34:55  AMANDA, YOU MAY BE ABLE TO HELP ME WITH THIS, DID SOME OF THIS COME FROM
19:34:58  THE SURVEY AS WELL?
>> YES, THESE
19:35:01  WERE MAINLY  DERIVED FROM THE SURVEY RESPONSES
19:35:04 .
>> PERFECT.
SO THIS
19:35:08  IS A BEGINNING, THIS IS A STARTING
19:35:11  POINT FROM THE FIRST PUBLIC HEARING, WE'RE IN THE SECOND.
AGAIN, THIS IS COMING FROM YOUR
19:35:14  CITIZENS -- OR YOUR RESIDENTS INDEED, I SHOULD HAVE MENTIONED THIS HAS NOTHING TO
19:35:17  DO WITH CITIZENSHIP.
THIS IS COMPLETE AND TOTAL RESIDENTS
19:35:20 , PEOPLE LIVING IN THE CITY OF
19:35:23  FREMONT.
BUT DO THESE MAKE SENSE, DO THEY NOT.
ARE THERE OTHERS THAT YOU
19:35:27  SHOULD INCLUDE OR YOU SHOULDN'T.
IS THERE A BOUNDARY THAT YOU THINK IS
19:35:30  IMPORTANT VERSUS  OTHERS.
I'M NOT INTIMATELY --
19:35:34  I KNOW WHERE FREMONT IS BUT I'M NOT INTIMATELY FAMILIAR WITH YOUR CITY
19:35:37  AND I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT.
ONLY YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO SORT OF
19:35:40  DETERMINE WHAT MAKES SENSE.
WE WOULD REALLY
19:35:43  LIKE TO -- THAT HELPS US TO THE EXTENT THAT WE'RE GOING TO DESIGN
19:35:46  AND DRAW MAPS, IT HELPS US DRAW THE MAPS THAT WE'RE
19:35:49  GOING TO DRAW.
BUT I SUSPECT IT WILL HELP YOUR
19:35:53  CITIZENS AS WELL.
AMANDA, ARE YOU LEANING IN
19:35:56  OR JUST CHECKING IN.
>> I JUST WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT THAT I SEE KRISTEN
19:35:59  HERE ON THE MEETING.
AND FOR THE COUNCILMEMBERS,
19:36:02  THE EIGHT QUESTION SURVEY AND THE RESPONSE
19:36:05 S WERE ATTACHED TO YOUR STAFF REPORT, IF YOU WANT A LITTLE CONTEXT OF
19:36:09  WHERE THIS COMES FROM.
THANK YOU.

19:36:12 >> SO I'LL FINISH THIS OFF AND KRISTEN, WELCOME,
19:36:16  AND WE'LL TRY AND TAG
19:36:19  TEAM OR DO THIS AS BEST WE CAN.

19:36:23 THERE ARE DIFFERENT MAPPING TOOLS THAT YOU CAN
19:36:26  USE.
YES, WE'RE IN A COMPUTER AGE BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE
19:36:29  FIND USING A PAPER MAP
19:36:33  MORE CONVENIENT.
IT LITERALLY IS A
19:36:36  PIECE OF PAPER THAT
19:36:40  YOU CAN DRAW WITH A CRAYO
19:36:43 N OR A PENCIL OR YOU CAN USE AN EXCEL SPREADSHEET THAT
19:36:46  CONNECTS TO THIS MAP, AND YOU SIMPLY GO AROUND
19:36:49  THOSE LINES AND YOU ADD UP ALL THOSE NUMBERS
19:36:53  WHICH -- SORRY, THIS SCREEN IS IN THE  WAY.

19:36:57 BUT YOU ADD UP THOSE NUMBERS AND IT WILL SHOW YOU
19:37:01  THE COUNTS OF EACH DISTRICT
19:37:04  THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DRAW, IF THAT MAKES SENSE.
YOU CAN
19:37:07  SEE HERE ON THE INSTRUCTIONS, IT'S EASIER FOR US IF WE
19:37:11  SEE A THICK COLORED PEN THAT DOES THIS.
AGAIN, THIS CAN BE DONE EASILY
19:37:14  BY HAND, AND IT ALSO CAN BE JUST CERTAIN AREA
19:37:18 S AS OPPOSED TO A FULL-ON
19:37:21  MAP.
SOMEBODY LOOKING AT THIS MIGHT ASK, HOW DO
19:37:24  THE FREEWAYS PLAY INTO THINGS
19:37:27 , WHERE ARE THE MAIN HIGHWAYS.
AS YOU ZOOM
19:37:31  IN AND OUT, YOU CAN SEE THE BOUNDARIES THAT YOU WOULD BE AWARE OF AS RESIDENTS OF
19:37:35  FREMONT.
SECONDLY, THERE'S A TOOL,
19:37:38  THE DISTRICTR ONLINE MAPPING TOOL.
IT'S A RELATIVELY
19:37:41  EASY TO USE TOOL.

19:37:44 THAT CITIZENS -- THERE'S TRAINING ON IT AS WELL.
FOLKS CAN
19:37:48  GET IN AND RESIDENTS CAN GET IN, USE THIS
19:37:51  TOOL, AND YOU'RE GOING TO SEE THE MAPS WERE, I THINK
19:37:54 , DONE IN THIS TOOL, IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN, KRISTEN
19:37:57 .
THESE ARE
19:38:00  ALL -- BY THE WAY, THESE TWO TOOLS ARE ON THE WEBSITE.

19:38:06 SO --
>> I CAN PROBABLY
19:38:10  TAKE IT FROM HERE, KEN.
>> DO YOU WANT IT?
>> I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT
19:38:13  TO STICK AROUND AND ADVANCE THE SLIDES OR IF I SHOULD SHARE
19:38:16  MY SCREEN, BUT I KNOW YOU MAY HAVE ANOTHER MEETING THAT
19:38:19  YOU ARE  RUNNING OFF TO?
>> I MIGHT.
BUT LET ME STAY WITH THIS
19:38:22 .
I'LL ADVANCE THE SCREENS UNTIL YOU GET TO THE END AND THEN WE'LL GO
19:38:23 .
>> PERFECT.
ALL RIGHT.

19:38:28 SO I WILL SAY, FREMONT, YOU ARE MOVING
19:38:31  AHEAD OF THE PACK.
YOU'RE MOVING QUICKLY
19:38:35 .
IT'S EXCITING TO SEE THAT YOU HAVE ALREADY STARTED TO
19:38:39  RECEIVE MAPS FROM THE PUBLIC
19:38:44  AND ONE MAP INTO THE MIX, WE ARE NOT SUGGESTING THAT THIS IS THE BEST MAP
19:38:47  OR THE MAP YOU SHOULD GO WITH, BUT JUST SO THAT YOU
19:38:50  HAVE SOMETHING ELSE ON THE TABLE
19:38:53  TO ROUND IT OUT, AND WE WILL ABSOLUTELY BE CONTINUING TO SOLICIT MAP
19:38:57 S FROM THE PUBLIC
19:39:00 , SO THIS BY NO MEANS IS
19:39:03  THE FINALIST OF MAPS THAT YOU WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO
19:39:07  CONSIDER.
OF THE SIX MAPS PRESENTED
19:39:10  OR SUBMITTED BY THE PUBLIC, I JUST WANT TO
19:39:13  POINT OUT THAT ONE OF THEM WAS NOT POPULATION
19:39:17  BALANCED AND TWO WERE INCOMPLETE.
SO THE NEXT SLIDE
19:39:20  WILL SHOW THOSE.
SO WE
19:39:24  JUST CLICKED TO THE NEXT SLIDE.
WHAT YOU HAVE HERE
19:39:27  IS ONE ON THE TOP RIGHT HERE, THE PUBLIC MAP
19:39:33  85704 DID HAVE A
19:39:37  25.93  DEVIATION, SO IT'S NOT GOING TO MEET THAT LEGAL
19:39:40  REQUIREMENT FOR POPULATION BALANCE.

19:39:44 AND THE OTHER TWO MAPS WERE
19:39:47  PARTIAL MAPS THAT ARE NOT
19:39:50  COMPLETE.
SO
19:39:54  IT'S IMPORTANT TO STILL LOOK AT THESE MAPS TO SEE WHAT MESSAGES THE PUBLIC
19:39:58  IS SENDING WITH THEM,
19:40:01  SO CERTAINLY WITH THAT MAP ON THE BOTTOM, PERHAPS THEY'RE
19:40:06  DRAWING THEIR COMMUNITY OF INTEREST AND THEY USED THE DISTRICTING TOOL OR PERHAPS THEY'RE TRYING
19:40:11  TO DRAW JUST ONE DISTRICT.
ALL OF THIS IS INFORMATION THAT WE CAN
19:40:14  INTEGRATE ALONG WITH THE WONDERFUL RESULTS OF THE SURVEY
19:40:17  THAT AMANDA HAS WORKED ON.
SO THE NEXT
19:40:20  SLIDE, I AM GOING TO SHOW YOU JUST REALLY QUICKLY
19:40:24  AN OVERVIEW OF ALL OF THESE MAPS, AND THEN IF DURING YOUR DISCUSSION YOU
19:40:27  WANT TO LOOK MORE CLOSELY AT ANY OF THEM,
19:40:32  I WILL PULL THOSE UP ON THE BROWSER AND YOU CAN ZOOM IN AND
19:40:35  OUT ON THESE MAPS, AND AGAIN, FOR MEMBERS OF THE
19:40:38  PUBLIC, WE WELCOME YOUR FEEDBACK
19:40:41  ON COMMUNITIES OF INTEREST ON THESE
19:40:44  PARTICULAR DRAFT MAPS OR MAPS THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE OR PRESENT IN THE
19:40:48  FUTURE, AND FROM THE COUNCIL ANY DIRECTION
19:40:51  FOR THE NEXT HEARING IN TERMS
19:40:55  OF WHAT YOU WOULD LIKE NDC TO BRING OR
19:40:58  WHAT FEEDBACK YOU HAVE ON WHAT'S BEEN PRESENTED TODAY.

19:41:03 SO YOU CAN SEE AS WELL WITH THESE
19:41:06  PUBLIC MAPS, WE DO -- THERE'S A LOT OF
19:41:09  VARIATION.
SO THIS MAP
19:41:12  IS  POPULATION-BALANCED WITH
19:41:16  2.54%.
AND WE'LL LOOK AT THE NEXT ONE.

19:41:23 SO YOU CAN SEE HOW SORT OF
19:41:26  DIFFERENT IN THE DOWNTOWN AND CENTRAL AREAS OF FREMONT,
19:41:30  HOW DIFFERENTLY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC ARE CONCEIVING OF THESE BOUNDARY
19:41:33 IES.
AGAIN, THIS IS A MAP THAT HAS A
19:41:36  2.1% DEVIATION.
AND THEN THERE'S
19:41:40  ONE MORE PUBLIC MAP HERE,
19:41:43  AND THIS MAP TAKES A SORT OF TOTALLY DIFFERENT APPROACH
19:41:50  TO FREMONT, SORT OF SLICING THE PIE IN A DIFFERENT WAY THAN
19:41:53  IT CURRENTLY IS.

19:42:01 WHEN WE LOOK AT THESE ON DISTRICTR, YOU CAN CLICK A BUTTON TO
19:42:04  COMPARE WHAT'S BEEN DRAWN TO THE CURRENT BOUNDARIES.
THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M SHOWING YOU
19:42:07  HERE IN THESE SLIDES.

19:42:12 BUT FOR ANYONE JUST SORT OF THINKING, I'M SURE  COUNCILMEMBERS OR THE MAYOR
19:42:15  ARE THINKING, WHAT DOES THIS LOOK LIKE COMPARED TO THE CURRENT LINES
19:42:18 ?
I'LL SHOW YOU WHERE YOU CAN CHECK THAT BOX AND LOOK AT THAT
19:42:21 .
BUT THEN TO END
19:42:25  WITH NDC DID CREATE A MINIMAL CHANGE
19:42:28  MAP.
THIS MAP BRINGS THE
19:42:32  TOTAL POPULATION DEVIATION DOWN TO
19:42:36  3.2%, AND THE GOAL OF THIS MAP, BECAUSE IT WAS SO
19:42:39  EARLY IN THE PROCESS
19:42:45  AND I HAVE NOT RECEIVED DIRECTION FROM THE COUNCIL YET TO DRAW
19:42:48  MAPS WITH ANY SPECIFIC CHANGES, SO I AIM TO PRESERVE THE
19:42:51  CURRENT DISTRICTS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE, AND
19:42:55  IN FACT, I BELIEVE AT LEAST TWO OF THESE DISTRICTS ARE
19:42:58  TOTALLY UNCHANGED.
IN FACT -- YEAH
19:43:02 , CHANGES WERE ONLY MADE TO FOUR OF
19:43:05  THESE DISTRICTS.
SMALL CHANGES JUST TO TRY TO MOVE POPULATION
19:43:09 .
SO AGAIN WE'RE NOT REALLY
19:43:12  SAYING THAT THIS IS A GOOD MAP FOR YOU, BUT JUST TO SHOW YOU
19:43:15  WHAT ONE OPTION MIGHT BE, AND TO SHOW YOU HOW MUCH
19:43:19  POPULATION WOULD NEED TO MOVE
19:43:22  IN ORDER TO BRING THAT TOTAL DEVIATION DOWN TO A LOWER NUMBER.

19:43:25 SO THE NEXT TWO SLIDES JUST SHOW
19:43:28  IN THIS MINIMAL CHANGE MAP WHAT THE
19:43:32  TWO CHANGES ARE.
SO THE FIRST CHANGE IS THE CHANGE
19:43:35  BETWEEN DISTRICTS 1 AND 2.

19:43:40 SO THE THICK BLACK LINES ARE THE CURRENT
19:43:43  DISTRICTS, THEN THE COLORED AREA, THE COLOR THE  AREAS ARE
19:43:46  THE PROPOSED
19:43:50  CHANGES, AND SO THE PINK IS DISTRICT 1, AND
19:43:53  THE BLUE IS DISTRICT 2, SO YOU SEE WE'RE JUST PULL
19:43:57 ING SORT OF THAT ONE NEIGHBORHOOD THERE
19:44:00  INTO DISTRICT
19:44:05  1.
I'M NOT NECESSARILY SUGGESTING THIS IS LOGICAL.

19:44:08 YOU COULD PULL OTHER PARTS OF DISTRICT 2 INTO DISTRICT 1, BUT
19:44:11  THAT'S THE SORT OF CHANGE THAT WE COULD
19:44:14  MAKE MINIMALLY ON THE
19:44:17  POWN DRI
19:44:21  BOUNDARY LINES IN ORDER TO
19:44:24  BALANCE POPULATION.
SIMILARLY WE'RE DOING
19:44:27  SAME SORT OF THING HERE, THE BLACK LINES ARE THE CURRENT
19:44:30  DISTRICT BOUNDARIES AND THE GREEN SHADE AREA IS THE
19:44:34  PROPOSED  DISTRICT 3 AND THE YELLOW SHADED AREA IS
19:44:37  THE PROPOSED DISTRICT 6.
SO JUST PULLING
19:44:41  A CHUNK OF POPULATION
19:44:45  FROM DISTRICT 6 INTO DISTRICT
19:44:48  3 TO BALANCE OUT POPULATION.
SO HOPEFULLY
19:44:51  IF ANYTHING, WHAT THIS DOES
19:44:54  IS JUST GIVE YOU
19:44:58  A STARTING POINT FOR YOUR DISCUSSION GOING FORWARD FOR WHAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO
19:45:01  SEE IN FUTURE PROPOSALS.

19:45:08 SO WE CAN END IT THERE.
I THINK THERE'S JUST THE LAST SLIDE ENCOURAGING
19:45:10  DISCUSSION AND GIVING YOU AN OPPORTUNITY TO OPEN THE PUBLIC COMMENT.

19:45:18 OR ASK ANY QUESTIONS.
>> SHOULD I STOP SHARING AT THIS POINT?

19:45:21 >> THAT WOULD BE GREAT, KEN.
THANK YOU.

19:45:25 >> Mayor Mei: SO AT THIS TIME, I'D LIKE
19:45:28  TO THANK YOU FIRST FOR THE PRESENTATION AND AMANDA AND THE TEAM FOR THE WORK
19:45:31 .
I WOULD LIKE TO TURN IT OVER TO THE COUNCIL FIRST FOR CLARIFYING QUESTIONS
19:45:34 , AND THEN AFTER WHICH I WILL OPEN THE PUBLIC HEARING
19:45:36 .
FIRST, CLARIFYING QUESTIONS FROM THE COUNCIL.

19:45:43 COUNCILMEMBER JONES.
>> Councilmember Jones: THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR
19:45:47 .
SO
19:45:51  KRISTEN, JUST A QUICK QUESTION.
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO PUBLIC MAPS AND THE
19:45:54  MINIMAL MAP THAT YOU HAVE PROPOSED
19:45:58 , IS THE POPULATION DIFFERENCE ACTUALLY SMALLER ON THE
19:46:02  TWO PUBLIC MAPS THAN IT IS ON YOUR PROPOSAL
19:46:06 ?

19:46:12 >> GOOD QUESTION.
THAT MAY BE TRUE.
WHAT DID I SAY FOR THE
19:46:15  NDC MINIMAL CHANGE, YES, OUR
19:46:18  DEVIATION IS 3.2%.
YEAH.
AND
19:46:22  TWO OF THE PUBLIC MAPS GOT THAT MAXIMUM DEVIATION
19:46:25  UNDER 3%, YEAH.
SO THEY'RE CLOSE,
19:46:28  BUT -- WE ALWAYS
19:46:31  HOPE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC CAN DO IT BETTER, BUT AGAIN
19:46:35 , I THINK NDC WILL
19:46:38  BE MAKING
19:46:41  ADDITIONAL MAPS BASED ON WHAT COUNCIL
19:46:45  ASKS US TO BRING FORWARD.

19:46:48 >> Councilmember Jones: OKAY.
AND ONE OTHER QUESTION ON BOTH OF THE
19:46:51  MAPS SUBMITTED BY THE PUBLIC, IF I'M
19:46:55  NOT MISTAKEN, IT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFICULT TO TELL
19:46:58  AT SOME POINTS BECAUSE THERE ARE NO STREET NAMES ON ANY OF THE MAPS, BUT BOTH
19:47:01  OF THOSE SUBMISSIONS ARE MOVE
19:47:04 ING THE DISTRICT OF NILES INTO  DISTRICT 2,
19:47:08  IS THAT CORRECT?

19:47:12 I'M JUST GOING BY THE COLOR SHADING.
YES, YES.

19:47:15 LET ME PULL THOSE OPEN TOO.

19:47:19 JUST TO CONFIRM THAT.
I KNOW THAT
19:47:23  ONE OF THE PUBLIC COMMENTS THAT WE RECEIVED
19:47:27  MENTIONED THAT ONE OF THE ADVANTAGES OF THE CURRENT DISTRICT BOUNDARIES
19:47:30  WAS THAT IT PRESERVED INTACT THE
19:47:33  NILES DISTRICT.

19:47:37 SO THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT WE RECEIVED IN THE SURVEY.

19:47:42 AND YOU SHOULD ACTUALLY SEE STREET NAMES IF YOU ZOOM
19:47:46  IN CLOSE ENOUGH, IF YOU'RE ACTUALLY CLICKING THE
19:47:49  LINK ON THE DRAFT MAPS.
19:47:52  PAGE.

19:47:57 THE OTHER INTERESTING THING IS THAT YOU KIND OF HAVE TO KNOW WHAT THE DISTRICTS
19:48:00  ARE, THE NUMBERING
19:48:05  ON THIS ONLINE TOOL IS SOMETIMES, YOU KNOW, NOT
19:48:09  REALLY HELPFUL.

19:48:14 SO THERE ARE THREE PUBLIC MAPS
19:48:20 , AND IF YOU WANT, I CAN SHARE MY SCREEN HERE SO YOU
19:48:24  CAN SEE WHAT I'M LOOKING AT.
IF YOU WANT TO GO THROUGH THEM
19:48:27  REALLY QUICKLY, JUST SORT OF FOCUSING ON THAT ONE AREA.

19:48:34 >> Mayor Mei: SURE.
I SEE COUNCILMEMBER JONES NODDING HIS HEAD
19:48:35 .
>> OKAY, GREAT.
THANK YOU.

19:48:39 >> Councilmember Jones: FROM THE LOOKS OF IT, IT SEEMS THAT THAT
19:48:42  BOTH OF THOSE MAPS ARE FOLLOWING THE
19:48:45  ATTENDANCE AREA OF WASHINGTON HIGH SCHOOL.

19:48:48 >> YEAH, AND THAT'S ANOTHER THING THAT MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC REALLY
19:48:53  -- AND UNSURPRISINGLY REALLY RESONATED WITH THEM,
19:48:57  WAS THEIR COMMUNITIES OF INTEREST, AND
19:49:01  OFTENTIMES ARE DEFINED BY THEIR HIGH SCHOOL ATTENDANCE AREAS
19:49:04 .
SO
19:49:09  I'M GOING TO SHARE MY SCREEN.
>> Mayor Mei: RELATED TO THAT, I
19:49:12  JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY TO THE PUBLIC THAT WHILE THAT MAY BE
19:49:15  OF SOME INTEREST FOR THE DISCUSSIONS OR MAP DRAWINGS
19:49:18 , WE AS A CITY DO NOT SET THOSE BOUNDARIES
19:49:22 , JUST TO CLARIFY FOR
19:49:25  THE ATTENDANTS.
I READ ALL THE
19:49:28  COMMENTS, WE HAVE ABOUT 30-SOME, AS WE SAID
19:49:32 , BUT I SAW THEM AND SOME OF THE QUESTIONS WERE SPECIFICALLY
19:49:35  TOWARDS ATTENDANCE OF THEIR SCHOOL
19:49:38 , WHETHER ELEMENTARY, JUNIOR OR HIGH SCHOOL.
WE DO NOT SET
19:49:40  THOSE.
THOSE ARE SEPARATE FROM OUR DISTRICTS.

19:49:44 THOSE ARE COMMUNITIES OF INTEREST, MAYBE, BUT WE DO NOT SET
19:49:48  THE ATTENDANCE.
>> EXACTLY.
THOSE DISTRICT BOUNDARY
19:49:51 IES AS WELL FOR THOSE DISTRICTS ALSO HAVE A DIFFERENT LEGAL PROCESS
19:49:55  AND REQUIREMENT.
>> Mayor Mei: KRISTEN, BEFORE YOU BEGIN,
19:49:58  I JUST WANTED TO SEE THAT -- COUNCILMEMBER
19:50:01  SHAO HAS HIS HAND RAISED, HE'S
19:50:04  FROM DISTRICT 4.
COUNCILMEMBER SHAO, IS THIS RELATED TO THIS MAP?

19:50:08 OKAY.
WE'LL CALL YOU AFTER THIS WILL.

19:50:12 >> OKAY.
SO --
>> Mayor Mei: CLARIFY
19:50:15 ING QUESTIONS, YES.
>> I'M GOING TO JUST REALLY QUICKLY SHOW THE
19:50:18  THREE PUBLIC MAPS FOCUSED IN ON THE NILES DISTRICT.

19:50:25 SO I HAVE ADDED THE CURRENT DISTRICT BOUNDARIES, SO THOSE ARE
19:50:28  IN BLACK HERE.

19:50:32 AND THEN WHAT IS PROPOSED BY THE MEMBERS OF THE
19:50:35  PUBLIC IS  COLORED, AND I'LL GO BACK SO YOU CAN SEE THE POPULATION HERE
19:50:38 .
THIS
19:50:41  MAP IS 85739.

19:50:49 SO IF YOU'RE ON THE PAGE HERE, THIS IS THE SECOND ONE.

19:50:54 85739.

19:50:57 AND THEN
19:51:00  THIS ONE HERE IS
19:51:06  8017 OH, SO THAT'S ACTUALLY THE FIRST ONE, ON THE TOP HERE.
YOU CAN SEE
19:51:10  THAT WHAT THEY'RE DRAWING HERE IS ACTUALLY
19:51:14  QUITE DIFFERENT.
LET ME PULL
19:51:17  THE CURRENT DISTRICTS UP ON TO HERE.

19:51:22 AND THEN THE LAST ONE HERE
19:51:25 , WHICH WOULD BE
19:51:30  86345, IS AT LEAST IN
19:51:34  THIS NILES AREA A LITTLE BIT MORE SIMILAR TO THAT
19:51:37  ONE.

19:51:43 YEAH.
AND AGAIN, LET ME PULL THE CURRENT DISTRICT BOUNDARY
19:51:46 IES ON FOR YOU.

19:51:52 SO YOU CAN SEE, AND AGAIN
19:51:56 , THE NDC -- THIS WAS THE NDC MINIMAL
19:51:59  CHANGE MAP.
YOU CAN ALSO VIEW THE NDC MINIMAL
19:52:02  CHANGE MAP OR THE CURRENT DISTRICTS IN THIS
19:52:05  INTERACTIVE REVIEW MAP.
IF YOU WANT TO DO THAT
19:52:08 .
BUT IT DOES
19:52:11  LOOK LIKE
19:52:15  NILES DISTRICT, WHICH IS CURRENTLY IN DISTRICT
19:52:20  4.
LOOKS LIKE IT'S STAYING IN
19:52:25  DISTRICT 4, ALTHOUGH WITH THIS ONE MAP, IT'S SORT OF UNCLEAR WHAT
19:52:28  THE -- I DON'T THINK THAT WOULD BE DISTRICT 4 ANYMORE.

19:52:33 BUT THE OTHER TWO, I THINK IT STILL
19:52:37  WOULD BE -- OH, NO, YOU'RE RIGHT.
THAT'S
19:52:40  NOT A DISTRICT 4 ANYMORE, AND WHAT ABOUT THIS ONE?

19:52:43 THIS ONE IS KIND OF HARD TO  TELL.
YEAH,
19:52:46  NO.
SO YEAH.
ALL OF THOSE ARE MAKING
19:52:50  SUBSTANTIAL CHANGES FROM THE CURRENT MAP.

19:52:55 >> Councilmember Jones: OKAY.
THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:52:58 AT THIS TIME, AGAIN, CLARIFYING QUESTIONS, AND WE HAVE SOME
19:53:01  -- WE HAVE TO OPEN THE PUBLIC HEARING TOO.
SO COUNCILMEMBER SHAO
19:53:05 ,  CLARIFYING QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME.
>> Councilmember Shao: THANK YOU
19:53:08  YOU, MADAME MAYOR.
I HAVE TWO CLARIFYING QUESTIONS.

19:53:11 FIRST ONE IS FOR THE NDC
19:53:15  MAP, WOULD THAT
19:53:19  -- GOING TO -- WOULD THAT BE ABLE TO
19:53:22  ADDRESS THE ZIGZAGGING
19:53:26  BORDER THAT WAS LEFT
19:53:30  IN THE CURRENT BORDER THAT A LOT OF
19:53:33  PEOPLE THOUGHT
19:53:36  IT WAS A SIGN OF GERRYMANDER
19:53:40 ING, THAT'S, YOU KNOW, ONE
19:53:43  QUESTION.
SO THE
19:53:46  SECOND QUESTION IS THAT I NOTICED THAT
19:53:50  PUBLIC HAS IDENTIFIED WARM
19:53:53  SPRINGS BART STATION COMMUNITY
19:54:00  AS ONE COMMUNITY.
AND EVEN THOUGH RIGHT NOW THE HOUSE
19:54:04 S ARE BEING BUILT AND PEOPLE HAVEN'T MOVED IN,
19:54:07  BUT WE CAN FORESEE THAT
19:54:10  IN THE VENEER FUTURE,
19:54:14  THE LOCAL POPULATION IN THAT NEIGHBORHOOD IS GOING TO INCREASE
19:54:17  DRAMATICALLY, WHICH MAY OR MAY
19:54:20  NOT TIP OVER THE SO
19:54:23   CALLED BALANCE.
SO IS THAT ALSO
19:54:27  TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION?

19:54:32 >> NO, NOT YET.
AND PART OF WHAT I'M HERE TO DO TONIGHT IS TO
19:54:35  TAKE NOTES ON YOUR RECOMMENDATIONS.
SO
19:54:41  FIRST IN THE CASE OF THE WARM SPRINGS BART AREA, IF WE DID WANT TO UNDER
19:54:46 POPULATE DISTRICT 5 BY MAYBE ONE
19:54:49  1 OR 2%, DEPENDING
19:54:52  ON HOW MUCH GROWTH YOU ANTICIPATE, THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS
19:54:56  LEGALLY ADMISSIBLE AND SOMETHING THAT WE CAN
19:55:00  DO.
AGAIN, WE
19:55:03  NEVER REALLY WANT TO PRIORITIZE THINKING ABOUT FUTURE
19:55:06  GROWTH, BUT ONCE WE HAVE CONSIDERED COMMUNITIES OF INTEREST
19:55:10 , AND
19:55:13  ALL OF THE OTHER LEGAL REQUIREMENT, WE CAN DO THAT.
AND WITH
19:55:16  THE ZIGZAGGING LINES THAT WE HEARD A LOT FROM THE PUBLIC
19:55:19  ABOUT, PARTICULARLY THE DIVISION OF THE GLENMOOR
19:55:23  AREA, I THINK THAT
19:55:27  THAT DEFINITELY -- IF THERE ARE SPECIFIC SUGGESTIONS
19:55:31  FROM THE COUNCIL ON WHAT THEY MIGHT LIKE TO SEE IN THAT
19:55:34  AREA, I WOULD WELCOME THAT.
OTHERWISE IF YOU WOULD JUST
19:55:38  LIKE ME TO BRING FORWARD, BECAUSE MY
19:55:42  HUNCH -- BECAUSE THE POPULATION ALWAYS
19:55:45  HAS A RIPPLE EFFECT WHEN YOU MOVE THE POPULATION
19:55:49 , IT'S NOT JUST GOING TO BE ONE OPTION.

19:55:52 IN ORDER TO UNIFY GLENMOOR.
SO IF THE COUNCIL
19:55:55  WOULD LIKE ME TO BRING FORWARD TO THE NEXT
19:55:58  HEARING TWO OPTIONS THAT WOULD UNIFY GLENMOOR
19:56:02 , YOU KNOW, OR AS A MINIMUM
19:56:05 , RIGHT?
YOU KNOW, RATHER THAN JUST
19:56:08  ONE, I THINK THAT WOULD PROBABLY BE REASONABLE.

19:56:15 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU, COUNCILMEMBER SHAO.
IS THAT YOUR ONLY CLARIFY
19:56:18 ING QUESTION?
I THINK YOU'RE DONE?
OKAY
19:56:21 .
SORRY, YOU'RE ON MUTE.
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN
19:56:25 .
VICE MAYOR SALWAN, CLARIFYING QUESTION
19:56:27 S.
>> Vice Mayor Salwan: THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR.

19:56:30 YEAH, COUNCILMEMBER SHAO JOGGED MY MEMORY.
SO WHAT IS THE
19:56:33  CURRENT POPULATION OF THAT WARM SPRINGS AREA?
I KNOW
19:56:37  LIKE -- I DON'T KNOW, 75% IS OCCUPIED OR WHAT IS
19:56:40  THE ROOM FOR
19:56:44  GROWTH ONCE IT'S ALL FULLY OCCUPIED?
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN ANSWER THAT OR
19:56:47  IF ANYONE FROM STAFF KNOWS?
>> 
19:56:51 I COULD TELL YOU THE CURRENT DISTRICT 5, BUT I DON'T HAVE IT ACTUALLY
19:56:54  DOWN TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD LEVEL.
I COULD PULL IT BUT I DON'T HAVE IT RIGHT
19:56:56  NOW.
>> Vice Mayor Salwan: OKAY.
MAYBE IN THE FUTURE THEN.

19:57:00 THANKS.
>> Mayor Mei: I JUST WANTED TO MAKE A COMMENT.

19:57:03 I THINK UNFORTUNATELY THIS YEAR THE CENSUS IS GOING BACK AND
19:57:06  FORTH IN TERMS OF THE DEADLINE AS WELL AS SOME OTHER MITIGATING
19:57:09  FACTORS THAT MADE IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR US TO COUNT, AND I KNOW THAT WAS
19:57:13  A DISAPPOINTMENT FOR ME BECAUSE I WOULD LOVE
19:57:16  TO SEE US GET A BETTER COUNT.
UNFORTUNATELY BECAUSE OF
19:57:19  COVID AND OTHER PROJECTS, IN TERMS OF HAVING PEOPLE MOVE
19:57:22  IN WERE  DELAYED A LITTLE BIT TOO, SO WE SAW THAT.
AT THIS TIME,
19:57:26  I DON'T SEE ANY CLARIFYING QUESTIONS FROM THE COUNCIL.
I'M GOING
19:57:29  TO OPEN THE PUBLIC HEARING.
SO
19:57:35  WE'D LIKE TO CALL OUR SPEAKERS FOR THIS ITEM.
I'LL BEGIN
19:57:38  WITH DIANE SHAW.

19:57:44 >> SO I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING FOR THIS ITEM.
JUST
19:57:47  FOR --
>> Mayor Mei: OH.

19:57:51 MY APOLOGIES.

19:57:55 MAYBE THAT'S MY FAULT.
DID I SKIP EARLIER THE -- OH,  NO,
19:57:58  WE SAID WE HAVE TO GO  BACK -- IT'S BECAUSE
19:58:01  WE HAVE TO GO BACK TO PUBLIC COMMENT AFTER THE PUBLIC HEAR
19:58:04 ING.
SO KELLY, YOU'RE RAISING
19:58:07  YOUR HAND FOR THIS ITEM, CORRECT?
>> YES, I AM
19:58:09 .
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY.
WELCOME.

19:58:14 >> THIS DISTRICTING PROCESS  SHOWS
19:58:19  -- IT'S EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING.
LET'S START AT
19:58:22  THE TOP, AT THE DIVISION BETWEEN DISTRICT 1 AND DISTRICT 2.
YOU'RE
19:58:25  PROPOSING TO PUT A NARROW NECK IN ALONG
19:58:29  PASEO PADRE, AND RUN IT OVER AND THEN CREATE
19:58:32  THIS APPENDIX THAT'S GOING
19:58:36  TO GRAB SOME HOUSES, AND YOU'RE CALLING
19:58:39  THAT CONTIGUOUS.

19:58:46 WHICH IS STRETCHING THE MEANING ENORMOUSLY.

19:58:50 THAT SHAPE SHOWS, YOU KNOW, A
19:58:53  LACK OF
19:58:56  A DEEP SEEDED
19:59:00  FOUNDATIONAL GUT FEEL FOR WHAT
19:59:03  IS CONTIGUITY.
ALTHOUGH MAYBE IT'S LEGAL.

19:59:07 LET'S TALK ABOUT THE BOUNDARY BETWEEN DISTRICT
19:59:10  2 AND 3.
YOU'RE RELUCTANT TO
19:59:13  PLAY AROUND WITH THAT.
YOU WANT SUGGESTIONS?
WELL, WHY DON'T YOU GO BACK TO
19:59:16  THE 2017 WEBSITE, TAKE A LOOK AT THOSE MAPS, AND YOU'LL
19:59:19  SEE THAT THERE WAS A MAP THAT DIVIDED UP
19:59:22  GLENMOOR USING STRAIGHT LINES.

19:59:26 AND IT WAS A POPULATION
19:59:29  BALANCED MAP.
AND WHY DON'T YOU JUST GRAB THAT MAP THAT WAS
19:59:32  PUT TOGETHER BY, YOU KNOW, EXPERT CONSULTANTS,
19:59:35  AND USE THAT AND SEE HOW THAT WORKS.
AND
19:59:39  IF IT DOESN'T WORK, THEN TWEAK THAT A LITTLE BIT,
19:59:42  BUT I'LL TELL YOU ONE THING, THAT MAP WAS KIND OF
19:59:46  STRAIGHT AND KIND OF SIMPLE.
SO
19:59:49  THE DIFFICULTY IS NOT SO DIFFICULT
19:59:53  IF YOU HAVE ACCESS TO THE
19:59:56  2017 MAPS.
AND THIS QUESTION ABOUT, OH, MY, WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO
19:59:59  WITH ALL THOSE NEW PEOPLE THAT BOUGHT PROPERTIES,
20:00:02  HOMES, RESIDENCES, RIGHT NEXT TO THE
20:00:05  WARM SPRINGS BART STATION?
WELL,
20:00:10  UNFORTUNATELY, IF YOU STUDY THE LAWS,
20:00:13  YOU'LL FIND OUT THAT THAT'S AN
20:00:16  INVALID QUESTION.
WE ONLY CARE ABOUT WHAT WAS THE
20:00:19  POPULATION BALANCE AS OF
20:00:22  SOME DATE IN EARLY 2020, THE
20:00:26  CENSUS DATE.

20:00:30 IF POPULATION HAS CHANGED ENORMOUSLY IN THE LAST,
20:00:33  YOU  KNOW, YEAR OR YEAR AND A HALF OR WHATEVER, SIX MONTHS
20:00:36  OR HOWEVER LONG IT'S BEEN SINCE THE LAST CENSUS.

20:00:40 THAT'S NOT LEGALLY ADMISSIBLE.
YOU
20:00:43  CANNOT BE SETTING UP YOUR DISTRICTS IN ANTICIPATION OF FUTURE CHANGES
20:00:46  OR TO REACT TO CHANGES THAT YOU KNOW ALREADY HAPPENED,
20:00:49  BUT ONLY HAPPENED AFTER
20:00:53  -- YOU MUST SET UP YOUR DISTRICTS TO ACCOUNT FOR THE CENSUS
20:00:56  DATA.
THIS TALK ABOUT WHAT ARE WE
20:00:59  GOING TO DO WITH ALL THESE FUTURE CHANGES IS
20:01:03  COMPLETELY ILLEGAL AND IRRELEVANT.
AND PLEASE, PLEASE,
20:01:06  PLEASE, IF BACK TO THE 2017 MAPS AND FIX
20:01:10  THAT GLENMOOR DIVISION.
PLEASE.

20:01:13 THANK YOU.

20:01:20 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU FOR THE COMMENT.
I WOULD LIKE TO CALL ONE MORE TIME FOR
20:01:24  PUBLIC HEARING AND IF YOU CAN MAKE THE COMMENTS TODAY OR FEEL FREE TO
20:01:27  ALSO LOOK AT THE MAPS ONLINE.

20:01:30 SEEING NONE, I'M GOING TO CLOSE THE PUBLIC HEARING AT THIS TIME.
AND I'M
20:01:33  GOING TO TURN IT BACK TO COUNCIL FOR OUR COMMENTS AND DISCUSSION.

20:01:40 ARE THERE ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM THE COUNCIL?

20:01:50 OKAY.
COUNCILMEMBER SHAO.
OR
20:01:53  --
>> Councilmember Shao: THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR.

20:01:56 I JUST WANT TO MAKE A COMMENT ON
20:01:59  ONE OF THE THREE PUBLIC MAPS, WHERE
20:02:02  MISSION SAN JOSÉ COMMUNITY WAS DIVIDED
20:02:06  INTO THREE DIFFERENT PARTS, AND
20:02:09  THAT CERTAINLY, TO  ME, DIDN'T
20:02:13  COMPLY TO THE RULE OF
20:02:16  COMPACTNESS, AS WELL AS
20:02:19  REASONABLE BOUNDARY.
IF YOU LOOK AT THAT
20:02:23  MAP, DISTRICT 6, I
20:02:26  BELIEVE, LOOKS LIKE A
20:02:30  CANDLELIGHT OF SOME
20:02:33   SHAPE, INSERTING INTO
20:02:40  -- IN THE IRVINGTON COMMUNITY INTO THE MISSION SAN JOSÉ COMMUNITY.

20:02:43 THEREFORE, FURTHER DIVIDING THE MISSION SAN JOSÉ COMMUNITY.

20:02:47 SO EVEN THOUGH THAT MAP HAS THE BALANCE OF THE
20:02:50  POPULATION, I
20:02:54  JUST CAN'T HELP BUT POINT OUT
20:02:58  THE LACK OF COMPLIANCE WITH
20:03:02  THE CURRENT RULES.

20:03:04 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS.
COUNCILMEMBER JONES.

20:03:10 >> Councilmember Jones: THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR.
I JUST WANTED TO MAKE A COMMENT
20:03:13  THAT I'VE RECEIVED A NUMBER OF EMAILS
20:03:17  REGARDING THE INCLUSION OF WASHINGTON HIGH SCHOOL WITHIN
20:03:20  DISTRICT 2, SO MOVING THAT BOUNDARY
20:03:23  FURTHER EAST TO POSSIBLY
20:03:26  PASEO PADRE.
I DO NOT KNOW HOW THAT WOULD AFFECT THE POPULATION
20:03:29 .
I BELIEVE IT WOULD BE MINIMAL BECAUSE
20:03:32  SUCH A LARGE PORTION OF THAT LAND IS TAKEN UP BY THE HIGH SCHOOL PROPERTY ITSELF.

20:03:36 SO I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S SOMETHING THAT KRISTEN COULD LOOK INTO
20:03:39  GOING FORWARD OR NOT.

20:03:44 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS.
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN.

20:03:48 WELCOME.
>> Councilmember Kassan: THANK YOU.

20:03:52 RIGHT NOW, THE CENTERVILLE COMMERCIAL
20:03:56  DISTRICT IS DIVIDED INTO TWO PIECES, AND I THINK,
20:03:59  YOU KNOW, THAT IS A PRETTY COHESIVE AREA THAT HAS A LOT OF
20:04:02  POTENTIAL TO GROW AND BECOME KIND OF
20:04:06  A MORE URBAN WALKABLE DISTRICT AND I WOULD LIKE TO SEE
20:04:09  THAT ALL IN ONE DISTRICT INSTEAD OF
20:04:14  DIVIDED INTO TWO.
THANK YOU.

20:04:20 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

20:04:24 I DON'T SEE COMMENTS FROM OTHER MEMBERS ON THE COUNCIL AT THIS TIME.

20:04:32 OR OTHER ATTENDEES.
AGAIN, I STRONGLY ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO GET
20:04:35  INVOLVED IN THIS PROCESS, AND TO LOOK AT THE --
20:04:38  WHAT IS CONSIDERED COMMUNITIES OF INTEREST.
I
20:04:42  DO APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT YOU'RE ABLE TO LOOK AT
20:04:45  THE MAPS WITH THE OTHER OVERLAY, WHICH IS VERY
20:04:49  IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND THAT.
AND THEN AGAIN, I WOULD
20:04:52  JUST STRESS BECAUSE HAVING READ SOME OF THE QUESTIONS WERE
20:04:55  ABOUT  PARKS, CERTAINLY READ ABOUT GLENMOOR
20:04:58 , GOTTEN FEEDBACK ON THAT SPECIFICALLY, ABOUT TRYING TO BRING
20:05:01  BACK THE NEIGHBORHOOD TOGETHER,
20:05:04  OR ALL GLENMOOR.
A LOT OF THE QUESTIONS ABOUT ATTENDANCE
20:05:07  AREAS.
AND AGAIN, EVEN IF WE WERE TO DRAW COMMUNITY OF
20:05:11  INTEREST THAT WAY, I WAS LOOKING AT ONE OF THE DATA
20:05:15  POINTS THAT YOU NOTED, HOW MANY POPULATION BY
20:05:18  DISTRICT HAD CHILDREN OR HAD SCHOOL AGED CHILDREN
20:05:21 , I NOTICED THAT TOO WAS ONE OF THEM
20:05:24 , SO THAT WAS SOME OF THE DELINEATION AND THE
20:05:28   BREAKDOWN, SO I WOULD ASK  PEOPLE -- EVEN IF WE
20:05:31  WERE TO MAKE SOME OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS LOOKING AT SOME OF THAT,
20:05:34  AGAIN, IT DOES NOT AFFECT AT ALL THE ENROLLMENT PLACEMENT OR
20:05:38  THE FUNDING FOR THE SCHOOLS OR THE ATTENDANCE AREAS,
20:05:41  BECAUSE WE DO NOT -- I SAW SOME PEOPLE ASKING FOR CERTAIN
20:05:44  AMENITIES FOR THE SCHOOLS.
AGAIN, WE DO NOT GET
20:05:47  INVOLVED IN ANY OF THE SCHOOL SITES, LIKE THE MAINTENANCE OF
20:05:50  THOSE.
SO SEEING
20:05:54  NO OTHER QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME,
20:05:57  I'VE ALREADY CLOSED THE PUBLIC HEARING.
I WANT TO SEE
20:06:01  IF -- I HAVE A COUNCILMEMBER THAT RAISED THEIR HAND.

20:06:04 COUNCILMEMBER COX, DID YOU HAVE A CLARIFYING QUESTION OR COMMENT AT THIS TIME?

20:06:07 >> Councilmember Cox: I DID.
I WAS LOOKING AT THE
20:06:10  DNC MEMO AND CHANGE MAP, AND I
20:06:14  NOTICED THAT SOME OF THE
20:06:18  AREA THAT WAS IN
20:06:21  THE GREEN, WE HAVE HAD SOME OF THE
20:06:24  SMALL BUSINESSES AND COMMUNITIES OF
20:06:28  INTEREST AROUND STEVENSON
20:06:31  BOULEVARD, AND IN YOUR MAP, YOU HAD KIND OF CUT OFF A LOT
20:06:34  OF THAT, A
20:06:37  CERTAIN PORTION AROUND THAT AREA THAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE
20:06:41  RE-ENTERED IN WITH
20:06:45  STEVENSON, BECAUSE I THINK IT HADZ A LITTLE BIT MORE
20:06:48  ADDS A LITTLE BIT
20:06:51  MORE CONFUSION IF YOU CUT A CERTAIN PART OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD OUT.
I WOULD
20:06:54  LIKE TO SEE THE MISSION
20:07:00  MISSION -- AND BE BACK PART OF THE STEVENSON AREA, IF I CAN MAKE A RECOMMENDATION ON
20:07:03  THAT PART.
BECAUSE THAT'S A REALLY BUSY STREET
20:07:07 , AS YOU KNOW.
WITH STEVENSON
20:07:10  BOULEVARD AND INCLUDING BACK IN THAT AREA.

20:07:18 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

20:07:20 VICE MAYOR SALWAN.
>> Vice Mayor Salwan: THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR.

20:07:23 I GUESS THE DEMOGRAPHER IS LOOKING FOR COMMENTS, SO SOME OF THE STUFF THAT
20:07:26  WE TALKED ABOUT, I MIGHT AS WELL GET MY THOUGHTS OUT THERE.
SO I
20:07:30  THINK DEFINITELY THE GLENMOOR, WE WANT TO CLEAN UP,
20:07:33  MAKE IT NICE AND STRAIGHT, GET ALL THAT IN
20:07:36  ONE AREA.
I'M NOT FAMILIAR HOW THAT'S DIVIDED
20:07:39  BUT I DO AGREE WITH COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, IF WE
20:07:42  CAN MAKE CENTERVILLE CORE IN ONE DISTRICT, THAT WOULD BE
20:07:46  IDEAL.
I DIDN'T COMPLETELY
20:07:49  APPRECIATE COUNCILMEMBER SHAO'S COMMENT
20:07:52  -- DIDN'T REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT HE MEANT BY THREE DIFFERENT DISTRICTS,
20:07:56  BUT WE CAN DEFINITELY LOOK AT
20:07:59  MISSION SAN JOSÉ AND IF TON INTERSECTION OR SOME OF THE
20:08:02  AREAS THERE WHERE THERE MAY BE
20:08:05  SOME WAY TO UNITE SOME OF
20:08:08  THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS.
>> IF YOU'D LIKE,
20:08:11  I CAN SHARE MY SCREEN AND SHOW YOU THE
20:08:15  TWO THINGS THAT YOU JUST
20:08:18  WERE TALKING ABOUT,
20:08:22  SO MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WERE ALL ON THE SAME PAGE HERE
20:08:25  HERE.
THIS IS THE CURRENT MAP SO YOU CAN SEE THE CENTERVILLE
20:08:29  DISTRICT HERE THAT HAS PORTIONS OF IT IN DISTRICT
20:08:32  3 AND DISTRICT 2.
AND
20:08:35  THEN
20:08:39  THE MAP THAT WAS DIVIDING UP MISSION SAN JOSÉ, I
20:08:42  BELIEVE IT'S THIS ONE WHICH IS
20:08:46  80170, THE PUBLIC MAP, AND IT IS
20:08:50  MAKING -- THIS IS THE CANDLE, RIGHT, THE FLAME OF THE CANDLE
20:08:53 .
SO I DID MAKE A NOTE OF
20:08:56  THAT, AND THIS IS EXACTLY THE KIND OF FEET BACK
20:09:02  FEEDBACK THAT I'M LOOKING FOR, SO THANK YOU.
KEEP IT
20:09:05  COMING, AND I'M SORRY TO INTERRUPT.
I'LL STOP SHARING NOW.

20:09:10 >> Mayor Mei: I APPRECIATE THAT.
IT'S EASIER TO SEE SOMETIMES.

20:09:14 COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN?
>> AND ONE OF
20:09:17  THE MAPS WAS
20:09:20  -- MAYBE TOO FAR OUT OF SCOIP BUT THAT WAS DESIGNED BY THE COMMUNITY.

20:09:24 IT WOULD REQUIRE A LOT OF CHANGES.
REGARDING NILES
20:09:27 , I AM INTRIGUED BY SOME OF THE
20:09:31  MAPS THAT COMBINE THE NORTH
20:09:34  PART OF TOWN, SO IF DISTRICT 2 WENT UP TO
20:09:37  NILES, I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH
20:09:40  POPULATION THERE IS IN NILES, BUT
20:09:43  IF WE CAN HAVE UP TO MAYBE LIKE MISSION AND MOWRY
20:09:47 , OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT TO SEE IF THAT CAN BE
20:09:50  MADE PART OF DISTRICT 2, I WOULD BE OPEN TO THAT.

20:09:53 OF COURSE IT GOING TO -- IN MY
20:09:57  FEEDBACK FROM MY COLLEAGUES, TO SEE WHAT
20:10:00  THEY THINK.
BUT I THINK WE SHOULD EXPLORE SOME OF THESE THINGS
20:10:04 .   DISTRICT 6, I WAS SURPRISED BY THE POPULATION.

20:10:07 THAT'S QIED -- A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE
20:10:11  -- IF THERE'S SOME MINOR TWEAKS TO KIND OF
20:10:14  OFFSET SOME OF THE IMPACTS IF WE DO END UP CHANGING
20:10:18  DISTRICT 4, WE CAN LOOK AT THAT AS LONG AS THERE'S MAJORITY
20:10:22  CONSENSUS.
BUT OVERALL, I THINK THIS IS A GOOD
20:10:25  DISCUSSION, AND I THINK WE'VE GOT SOME
20:10:29  GOOD BUILDING BLOCKS.
LOOK FORWARD TO MORE DISCUSSIONS IN THE
20:10:31  FUTURE.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
COUNCILMEMBER KENG.

20:10:35 COMMENTS?
>> Councilmember Keng: THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR.

20:10:38 SO I THINK BEFORE THE CURRENT -- THE CURRENT BOUNDARY
20:10:41  LINES PROBABLY DISTRICT 1, THE LINE BETWEEN
20:10:45  DISTRICT 1 AND 2 IS PROBABLY THE MOST STRAIGHTFORWARD, WHICH IS
20:10:48  ONE STRAIGHT LINE ALONG DECOTO AND
20:10:52  HIGHWAY 880.
SINCE WE'RE LACKING A LITTLE BIT IN
20:10:55  POPULATION IN DISTRICT 1, SO I SAW
20:10:59  THAT MIDDLE POCKET ALONG PASEO
20:11:02  PADRE.
I GUESS IT DOES LOOK LIKE IT'S KIND
20:11:05  OF BECAUSE IT'S IN ITS OWN LITTLE POCKET,
20:11:09  SO I THINK WE COULD
20:11:14  EXPLORE OTHER OPTIONS IF THERE'S
20:11:20  OTHER AREAS, I THINK WE'D PROBABLY BE IN A SIMILAR SITUATION,
20:11:24  BUT I DO HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT THE COMMUNITY OF TRF
20:11:27 .
I'M NOT SURE IF I SAW ANY AREA THAT'S
20:11:30  IN DISTRICT 1 THAT'S PART OF THE COMMUNITY OF INTEREST
20:11:33  IN THAT LIST, OR
20:11:36  ARE THEY JUST LIKE EXAMPLES OF COMMUNITIES OF INTEREST BUT NOT
20:11:39  THE WHOLE LIST?

20:11:46 >> THAT'S A REALLY GOOD  QUESTION.
AMANDA, I
20:11:49  DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO ADD, IF WE'VE HEARD FROM FOLKS
20:11:53  EXPLICITLY FROM DISTRICT
20:11:56  1?
>> SO THE LIST THAT WAS  PRESENTED ON THE
20:11:59  SLIDES, THAT WAS A SUMMARY OF THE
20:12:02  TOP 10 COMMUNITIES OF INTEREST OR THE RESPONSES THAT WE
20:12:06  SAW OVER AND OVER THE MOST RESPONSES ABOUT.

20:12:10 SO I HAVEN'T GOTTEN
20:12:14  ANY
20:12:18  SPECIFIC EMAILS ABOUT DISTRICT 1, SO I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOUR
20:12:21  CONSTITUENTS TO BE ENGAGED IN THE PROCESS.

20:12:25 THE CITY HAS POSTED A LOT OF THINGS ON OUR SOCIAL
20:12:28  MEDIA SITES REGARDING THIS PROCESS OR IN THE FREMONT
20:12:32  CONNECTION NEWSLETTER, SO WE WILL CONTINUE TO  PROVIDEWAY
20:12:35 S THAT WE CAN REACH THE PUBLIC.
BUT I WOULD
20:12:38  SAY IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO SHARE TO YOUR
20:12:41  CONSTITUENTS AS WELL, WE WOULD WELCOME ALL THEIR FEEDBACK
20:12:46 .
>> City Mgr. Shackelford:CORREC T ME IF I'M WRONG, BUT THAT LIST WAS --
20:12:50  I'M SORRY.
I'M HAVING
20:12:53  COMPUTER ISSUES SO I'M ON TWO DIFFERENT
20:12:56  DEVICES.
THE LIST WAS REFLECTIVE
20:12:59  OF THE EIGHT QUESTIONS THAT WERE  ATTACHED TO THE STAFF
20:13:02  REPORT?
>> YES.
SO THE
20:13:06  ONLINE SURVEY.

20:13:09 >> OKAY, THANK YOU.

20:13:13 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
COUNCILMEMBER JONES.

20:13:19 >> Councilmember Jones: I WANTED TO ECHO THE COMMENTS MADE BY COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN AND COUNCILMEMBER
20:13:23  KASSAN,  STRAIGHTENING OUT THE LINE PROBABLY USE
20:13:26 ING MOWRY AT THE SOUTHERN BORDER
20:13:30 .
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN'S ABOUT THE LINE
20:13:34  CURRENTLY BETWEEN 2 AND 3, FREMONT BOULEVARD
20:13:36 , ONE SIDE OF THE STREET IS ONE DISTRICT, THE OTHER SIDE IS THE OTHER.

20:13:39 WE DO HAVE A MAJOR DEVELOPMENT, FINGERS CROSSED
20:13:43 , COMING IN  THERE, SO MOVING THAT LINE A LITTLE BIT
20:13:46  EAST, UPON BRI TO JASON WAY,
20:13:49  BUT ALSO MOVING IT NORTH AND EAST AGAIN
20:13:52  TO INCORPORATE DALE
20:13:55  HARD WEAR AND SOME OF THE OTHER BUSINESSES SO THAT ALL IS INCLUDED
20:13:58  BECAUSE THAT'S ALL PART OF THE CENTERVILLE BUSINESS AND COMMUNITY ASSOCIATION.

20:14:01 SO THAT DOES MAKE A LOT OF  SENSE.

20:14:08 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
AND I SEE COUNCILMEMBER COX.

20:14:11 >> Councilmember Cox: YES, I ALSO WANTED TO MAKE
20:14:15  SURE WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT SOME OF
20:14:18  THE
20:14:25  PUBLIC MAPS, IT'S TAKING ME A LITTLE WHILE TO GO BACK AND
20:14:28  FORTH HERE.
SOME OF THE PUBLIC MAPS, THEY'RE
20:14:31  VERY DIFFERENT AND NOT ALIGNED WITH SOME OF
20:14:34  THE THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN PROPOSED BACK IN
20:14:39  2017.
LOOKING AT SOME VERY DRASTIC
20:14:43  CHANGES WITH PUBLIC MAP
20:14:47  80170 AND 86343.

20:14:51 THAT COULD LEAD TO A LOT OF
20:14:55  NEIGHBORHOODS REALLY CONFUSED ON HOW THAT IS WORK
20:14:58 ED OUT.
AND
20:15:05  BETWEEN NDC MEMO MAP AND
20:15:09  THE MAP THAT IS
20:15:16  85739, FOR  DISTRICT 6, I THINK KEEPING ALONG THE
20:15:19  LINES OF STEVENSON,
20:15:22  PASEO PADRE, OSGOOD, AND
20:15:25  WE BACK AWAY UP AGAINST THE
20:15:29  FREEWAY
20:15:32 .
AND THEN ALSO ON AUTOMALL PARK
20:15:35  PARKWAY.
THOSE ARE KIND OF
20:15:40  THE -- WHAT'S CONSISTENT WITH WHAT'S BEEN ESTABLISH
20:15:44 ED WITH THE IRVINGTON AREA THERE, TO KIND OF KEEP ALONG
20:15:47  THOSE LINES.

20:15:50 BUT IT'S -- BUT NOT INCLUDING
20:15:53  ANY STREETS THAT GO INTO
20:15:59   MISSION, BECAUSE IT KIND OF GETS MORE CONFUSED THERE, THAT
20:16:02  OSGOOD IS KIND OF LIKE THE DRAWING LINE OF KEEPING WITHIN THE IRVINGTON
20:16:06  AREA.

20:16:21 THANK YOU.

20:16:24 >> MAYOR, YOU'RE MUTED.
>> Mayor Mei: I WAS SAYING THAT
20:16:28  I APPRECIATE THAT MANY PEOPLE HAVE WANTED TO GO
20:16:31  WITHIN SOME OF THE NATURAL STREET BOUNDARIES AND I KNOW HAVE
20:16:34 ING SAT FORMALLY AT LEAST ON AN
20:16:37  ATTENDANCE AREA, THAT'S OBVIOUSLY CHANGE
20:16:41 ED TOO, AT
20:16:44  ONE POINT -- TRYING TO PARALLEL NATURAL STREET AND BORDERS BUT THE
20:16:48  POPULATION PIECE OF IT IS SOMETIMES A LITTLE BIT OF A CHALLENGE.

20:16:51 SO I SAW THAT IF WE CAN DO -- I MEAN, I KNOW WE'VE BEEN DOING
20:16:54  A LOT OF OUTREACH, BOTH ON ETHNIC AND WITH
20:16:57  OUR COMMUNITY AND FAITH-BASED GROUPS
20:17:00 , BUT IF EACH OF US AS COUNCILMEMBERS COULD
20:17:03  ALSO TRY TO REACH OUT TO THOSE THAT YOU'RE WORKING WITH BECAUSE
20:17:06  I SAW WHEN READING THE COMMENTS, THERE WERE CERTAINLY SOME DISTRICTS
20:17:10  THAT WERE MORE VOCAL THAN OTHERS IN PROVIDING FEEDBACK
20:17:13 .
BECAUSE I LOOKED THROUGH ALL OF THEM.
SOME
20:17:16  ARE JUST MORE ENGAGED IN THIS PROCESS.
AND I WOULD
20:17:19  LOVE US TO HAVE MORE OF THAT INPUT EARLY ON, RATHER THAN
20:17:22  AT THE END, WHICH I THINK IS
20:17:26  MOST UNFORTUNATELY WHAT HAPPENS, IS THAT PEOPLE COME AT THE VERY END AND GO
20:17:29 , WAIT, I DON'T WANT THIS TO BE MY DISTRICT.
WELL,
20:17:32  THIS IS WHY WE'RE HAVING THESE FOUR PUBLIC HEARINGS, IS TO ENSURE
20:17:36  THAT PEOPLE DO GIVE US THOSE COMMENTS.
SO I'M HOPING THAT
20:17:39  PEOPLE DO JOIN US IN THIS.
AGAIN AS
20:17:42  COUNCILMEMBERS, FEEL FREE AS WELL AS OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS,
20:17:45  TO MOCKUP SOME OF THESE AND THEN TO COME TALK TO US ABOUT THIS IF YOU HAVE
20:17:48   QUESTIONS.
AND THAT'S WHY WE HAVE THESE HEARINGS AND
20:17:51  THESE EDUCATIONAL SESSIONS.

20:17:56 GREAT.
I'VE ALREADY CLOSED THE PUBLIC SESSION.

20:17:59 WE'RE GOING TO GO BACK, THIS TIME HAS NOW ENDED.
MY APOLOGIES TO
20:18:02  THE PUBLIC COMMENT PEOPLE.
BUT
20:18:06  THE WAY THAT THIS IS  DESIGNED BY LAW IS
20:18:09  FOR OUR REDISTRICTING PROCESS MUST BE
20:18:12  CONDUCTED EXACTLY AT 7:15.
SO NOW WE'RE GOING
20:18:15  TO GO BACK TO PUBLIC COMMENT, AND ANY
20:18:18  OF THE SPEAKERS.
I SEE
20:18:21  DIANE SHAW IS STILL THERE, PATIENTLY WAITING.
SO
20:18:24  MS. SHAW?
>> THANK YOU.
I HAVE NO PROBLEM, IT WAS VERY 
20:18:28 INTERESTING LISTENING TO THE LAST ONE.
HELLO, MY NAME IS
20:18:31  DIANE SHAW AND I AM VICE PRESIDENT OF OHLONE
20:18:34  HUMANE SOCIETY.
OHS IS A VOLUNTEER-RUN
20:18:37   NON-SHELTER ORGANIZATION THAT SERVES THE NEEDS OF
20:18:41  WILD AND DOMESTIC
20:18:44  ANIMALS IN OUR COMMUNITY.
WE FOCUS ON PET OVERPOPULATION AND PROVIDE SUPPORT
20:18:47  TO  STRUGGLING PET OWNERS.
WE'VE PARTNER DOLLARS WITH THE  TR
20:18:51 I -- THERE WAS PUBLIC OUTDRY OVER THE
20:18:55  EUTHANASIA RATE AT THE SHELTER.
WE PUT TOGETHER BOTH THE TN
20:18:58 R TEAM AND KIT ENFOSTER PROGRAM TO HELP U.S. PORE
20:19:01  SUPPORT THE PROGRAM.
TNR
20:19:04  STANDS FOR TRAP NEUTER RETURN AND IS ALL ABOUT
20:19:07  ENSURING OUR COMMUNITY CATS ARE FIXED SO WE DON'T
20:19:10  GET INUNDATED.
ABOUT ONE-THIRD OF OUR CALL
20:19:13 S AND EMAILS WERE ABOUT
20:19:17  HOW TO GET
20:19:20  CATS FIXED YOU CAN SEE THE PROBLEM IS
20:19:23  GROWING IN OUR COMMUNITY.
AND THIS DOESN'T INCLUDE THE NUMBER OF
20:19:27  DOMESTIC CATS AND KITTENS THAT NEED THE SAME SURGERY DONE.

20:19:30 IT IS QUICKLY GETTING OUT OF CONTROL AND THERE ARE NOT
20:19:33  ENOUGH VETERINARIANS TO HELP US WITH OUR WORK.
THE SHELTER
20:19:37  HAS THE SAME ISSUE.
I'M HERE TO SAY THANK YOU FOR
20:19:40  INCREASING THE CONTRACT ALLOWANCE FOR THE VETERINARIAN SERVICE
20:19:43  AT THE SHELTER THAT YOU DID ON NOVEMBER 2ND.
THAT REALLY WAS A HELP.

20:19:47 BUT TO BE HONEST, IT'S NOT ENOUGH.
WE NEED A FULL TIME VET AT THE
20:19:50  SHELTER TO ASSIST WITH ALL OF THE COMMUNITY NEEDS.
AND THIS
20:19:53  IS A TRI-CITY SHELTER BUT WHEN IT COMES TO COMMUNITY CATS,
20:19:56  THEY ONLY SERVE FREMONT AND NOT UNION CITY OR NEWARK.

20:20:00 CURRENTLY THE SHELTER IS NOT  DOING ANY SPAY AND NEW
20:20:03  NEUTER
20:20:06  SERVICES AND THAT IS REALLY HURTING OUR PROGRAMS AS WELL.
WE USED TO BE
20:20:09  ABLE TO RELY ON THE SHELTER AT LEAST ONE DAY A WEEK TO HELP UTION
20:20:13  WITH THE COMMUNITY CATS BUT NOW THEY
20:20:16  AREN'T ENOUGH OF THEM WILLING TO DO THIS SERVICE, ALTHOUGH
20:20:19  I DO HAVE TO GIVE A SHOUT OUT TO DR. SALWAN BECAUSE HE'S
20:20:23  BEEN AN INCREDIBLE HELP.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE'D DO ABOUT HIM.
SO
20:20:26  WHILE WE HAVE A GREAT PARTNERSHIP WITH THE SHELTER, AND I EXPECT THAT
20:20:29  TO CONTINUE, THE SHELTER NEEDS YOUR HELP IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE THE
20:20:32  SERVICE OF THE COMMUNITY THAT THEY SO DESPERATELY NEED.
WITHOUT
20:20:35  THE HELP OF THE SHELTER, ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS OURS WILL
20:20:39  STRUGGLE TO HELP OUR COMMUNITY.
AND YOU NEED US AS
20:20:42  WELL, OR THE PROBLEM WILL SOON GET OUT OF CONTROL.
SOME
20:20:45  WILL SAY IT ALREADY HAS.
PLEASE PROVIDE MORE BUDGET
20:20:48  TO HIRE A FULL TIME VET IN THE
20:20:51  COMING YEAR AND PLEASE ALLOW THEM TO HIRE THE STAFF CURRENTLY ON FREEZE
20:20:55  THAT THEY NEED TO DO THIS VERY IMPORTANT WORK.
THANK YOU
20:20:58  FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK.

20:21:05 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU, MS. SHAW.
NEXT SPEAKER IS CONNOR CHEN.

20:21:10 WELCOME.
>> 
20:21:12 OKAY.
HELLO, EVERYONE.
MY NAME IS CONNOR CHEN.

20:21:16 AND I'M A SENIOR AT IRVINGTON HIGH SCHOOL.
SO OVER THE PAST
20:21:19  YEAR, I'VE WITNESSED A SIGNIFICANT ESCALATION IN
20:21:22  HATE SPEECH, HATE CRIME AND OTHER HARASSMENTS AGAINST MEMBERS
20:21:25  OF THE ASIAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY.
AND IN FACT
20:21:28 , LIKE STUDYS HAVE REVEALED ONE QUARTER OF
20:21:32  ASIAN AMERICANS AND PACIFIC ISLANDER YOUNG ADULTS
20:21:35  HAVE BEEN A TARGET OF RACISM SINCE THE START OF THE PANDEMIC
20:21:38 .
THESE FORMS OF HARASSMENT COME IN
20:21:41  MANY FORMS, TO PHYSICAL VIOLENCE AGAINST
20:21:44  ASIAN AMERICANS IN COMMUNITIES SUCH AS L.A., BAY AREA
20:21:48 , NEW YORK, AND MANY MORE.

20:21:51 THESE WORDS NOT ONLY IMPACT THE ASIAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY
20:21:54 , BUT THERE'S ALSO A LARGE IMPACT ON FOREIGN INDIVIDUALS
20:21:58  WHO WORK, STUDY AND TRAVEL IN THE UNITED STATE.
NORMALIZE
20:22:01  RACISM AGAINST ASIANS HAS LED TO A LARGER CULTURE
20:22:05  OF HATE, PREJUDICE AND INTOLERANCE NOT
20:22:08  ONLY AMONG ASIANS BUT IN OUR SOCIETY AS A WHOLE.
WHEN
20:22:12  POLITICIANS
20:22:15  FAIL TO ACKNOWLEDGE THESE STREUTS IT EXACERBATES
20:22:18  ORIGINAL CRIME AND LEAVES FAMILIES SUBJECT TO
20:22:22  VICTIMIZATION.
LAST
20:22:25  WEEK AN 18-YEAR-OLD PHILADELPHIA NATIVE WAS
20:22:29  BRUTALLY ATTACKED, SHE WAS
20:22:32  THROWN TO THE GROUND, KICKED AND BRUTALLY  BEAT, ALL WHILE
20:22:35  BEING CALLED RACIAL SLURS.
HOWEVER, THIS NEWS IS NOT
20:22:38  UNCOMMON.
EVERY WEEK, I HAVE BEEN HEARING NEW FORMS OF VIOLENCE
20:22:42 , FROM THE 89-YEAR-OLD WOMAN BEING LIT ON FIRE TO A
20:22:45  61-YEAR-OLD MAN BEING IN
20:22:48  CRITICAL CONDITIONS.
DESPITE ITS HIGH PRIORITY POPULATION
20:22:52 , FREMONT IS ALSO NOT AN EXCEPTION.

20:22:55 AT IRVINGTON, I FREQUENTLY WITNESS SEVERAL FORMS
20:22:58  OF RACISM, CYBERBULLYING.

20:23:03 OUR COMMUNITY MUST TAKE ACTION AND STAND AGAINST ASIAN HIT
20:23:06 .
FROM STEREOTYPES TO RACIST REMARKS TO PHYSICAL
20:23:10  ATTACKS, PREJUDICE AGAINST MINORITIES WILL ONLY
20:23:13  CONTINUE TO GROW.
THE SUPPORT OF
20:23:16  ANY FORUM CAN CREATE AN
20:23:20  EVERLASTING IMPACT ON THE ASIAN COMMUNITY, WHETHER ATTENDING
20:23:23  PROTESTS, TO SIMPLY LEARNING ABOUT CULTURE AND HISTORY OF
20:23:26  ASIAN AMERICANS.
I STRONGLY ENCOURAGE EVERYONE TO BEGIN TO
20:23:29  TAKE ACTION AND TAKE A STAND AGAINST RACISM.
THANK YOU.

20:23:33 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU FOR SHARING THAT.
I WANTED JUST TO
20:23:36  NOTE WITH THE PUBLIC THAT IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR ADDITIONAL RESOURCES,
20:23:39  THERE IS INFORMATION AVAILABLE ON OUR CITY WEBSITE,
20:23:42  AND WE'VE ALSO PARTNERED WITH
20:23:45  THE D.A. AND CONTINUE WITH THE SCHOOL DISTRICT
20:23:49  BUT HEART BRO KIN TO SEE
20:23:53  -- UNFORTUNATELY IT'S SOMETHING NOW THAT MORE THAN
20:23:56  EVER, WE NEED PEOPLE TO STAND UP, SO I APPRECIATE YOU SHARING THAT.

20:24:00 NEXT SPEAKER IS KELLY ABREU.

20:24:07 >> HI.
I'D LIKE TO DIRECT YOUR ATTENTION
20:24:11  TO A NEWSPAPER ARTICLE BY JOAN MORRIS.
IT
20:24:14  APPEARED IN THE MERCURY
20:24:17  NEWS ON NOVEMBER 28.

20:24:20 THE HEADLINE IS: -- AND THIS IS VERY
20:24:23  MUCH -- IT'S ALMOST EXACTLY
20:24:28  WHAT MS. SHAW JUST TOLD US  ABOUT.
RESCUE GROUPS RUNNING INTO PROBLEMS
20:24:31  TRYING TO STOP CAT OVERPOPULATION
20:24:34 .
THEY TALK ABOUT LACK OF ACCESS TO SPAY/NEUTER
20:24:38  CLINICS, AND BASICALLY IT'S
20:24:42  SKILLED MANPOWER BECAUSE DR. SALWAN CAN TELL YOU THAT IT
20:24:45  ACTUALLY REQUIRES SOME SKILL TO SPAY OR NEUTER A CAT.

20:24:50 YOU CAN'T JUST HAVE ANYBODY DOING IT
20:24:53 .
IT
20:24:57  ACTUALLY REQUIRES SOME PROFESSIONALS.
SO THIS KIND OF
20:25:00  PRACTICAL DIFFICULTIES IN
20:25:03  THERE, WE NEED TO ADDRESS THEM IN
20:25:06  VARIOUS WAYS.
IT'S HAPPENING ALL OVER THE BAY AREA.
NOT JUST HERE IN FREMONT.

20:25:10 IT'S HAPPENING EVERYWHERE.
AND IT'S HAPPENING
20:25:13  A LOT MORE NOW THAN BEFORE, FOR THE REASONS THAT
20:25:16  ARE DESCRIBED IN THIS NEWSPAPER ARTICLE.

20:25:19 SO YOU KNOW, I WOULD LIKE TO DRAW
20:25:23  A PARALLEL, THOUGH, AS I'VE ALREADY WRITTEN
20:25:26  TO SOME OF THE MEMBERS OF THE CITY COUNCIL
20:25:29 , TO THIS CLOSURE OF MISSION PEAK.
THIS
20:25:33  CITY COUNCIL WAS SO VOCAL, SO OUTSPOKEN
20:25:37  IN SAYING THAT THEY DIDN'T CLOSE THE PARK, THE
20:25:41  900-ACRE PARK, ONLY CLOSED THE STREET.
OF COURSE FACTUALLY, THAT
20:25:44  IS COMPLETELY COUNTER FACTUAL,
20:25:47  COMPLETELY CONTRARY TO WHAT ACTUALLY --
20:25:50  WHAT HAPPENED ON THE GROUND.
AND THERE'S
20:25:53  EVEN PHOTOGRAPHIC EVIDENCE TO PROVE THE FALSE
20:25:57 ITY, THE FALSEHOOD, THE UNTRUTH OF
20:26:00  THAT CLAIM.
AND YOU KNOW
20:26:04 , WHEN WE COMPARE THAT TO
20:26:08  THE TAD CLINIC, I WOULD ASK, ARE YOU GOING TO SAY
20:26:11  WE DIDN'T CLOSE THE CAT CLINIC?
WE JUST DON'T
20:26:15  HAVE ANY  SPAY/NEUTER APPOINTMENTS AVAILABLE?
YOU
20:26:18  KNOW, THESE FINE LEGAL DISTINCTIONS
20:26:24 , THEY DON'T MATTER WHEN IT COMES TO CAT OVERPOPULATION.
THE
20:26:27  CATS OVERPOPULATION HAS TO BE DEALT WITH ONE WAY OR ANOTHER
20:26:31  ANOTHER.
YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT EASY.

20:26:34 AND WHEN YOU CLOSE PARKS, THERE'S MANY WAYS TO CLOSE A PARK
20:26:38 .
YOU CAN OWN UP TO IT.
YOU
20:26:41  DON'T
20:26:45  HAVE TO RUN AND HIDE FROM IT.
YOU SHOULDN'T BE SPEWING  FALSEHOODS ABOUT
20:26:48  HISTORICAL FACTS OF WHAT THE CITY OFFICIALS ACTUALLY
20:26:52  DID AT MISSION PEAK.
IT'S THE SAME WITH THE CATS.

20:26:55 THANKS.

20:27:00 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
NEXT SPEAKER IS RICKEY LIN.

20:27:04 WELCOME.

20:27:10 >> GOOD EVENING.
I'M ONE OF CONNOR'S COLLEAGUES.

20:27:14 I COULDN'T SEEM TO UNDERSTAND WHY, AS A YOUNG KID ATTENDING
20:27:18  ELEMENTARY SCHOOL I REMEMBER LISTENING TO MARTIN LUTHER KING
20:27:21 KING JR.'S I HAVE A DREAM SPEECH AND WATCHING IN AWE AS HUNDREDS
20:27:24  OF THOUSANDS GATHERED TO FIGHT FOR THEIR RIGHTS.
I COULDN'T UNDERSTAND.

20:27:27 NEXT I GREW A LITTLE BIGGER, A LITTLE TALL
20:27:30 ER.
ENTERING HORNER
20:27:33  JUNIOR HIGH I SAW MALAY
20:27:36  LA, HOW HARD SHE FOUGHT FOR WOMEN'S EDUCATIONS AND RIGHTS.

20:27:40 I STILL COULDN'T SEEM TO GRASP WHY, WHY DID ALL THESE PEAM CARE SO
20:27:43  MUCH?
THAT'S WHEN IT CAME TO ME, NOW AS A JUNIOR AT
20:27:46  IRVINGTON HIGH SCHOOL AND A FREMONT RESIDENT WHO
20:27:49  HAS LED WITHIN MY FAMILY, BOY SCOTT TROOP
20:27:52 , FOOTBALL TEAM AND CLASSROOM AND MY COMMUNITY I NOW UNDERSTAND.

20:27:55 LOTS OF PEOPLE DISTANCE THEMSELVES FROM ONE ANOTHER  BASED ON THEIR DIFFERENCES
20:27:58  BUT OFTEN FAIL TO REALIZE ALL THEY HAVE IN COMMON.
I BELIEVE
20:28:01  THE FIGHT AGAINST RACIAL DISCRIMINATION IS A HARD ONE, ESPECIALLY
20:28:05  WHEN PEOPLE DRIFT AWAY FROM EACH OTHER.
ACKNOWLEDGING
20:28:08  DIFFERENCES BUT STILL COMING TOGETHER MEANS  HAVING EMPATHY AND
20:28:11  RESPECT.
AND A LOT OF TIMES I THINK SOME PEOPLE FORGET ABOUT THAT.

20:28:15 ESPECIALLY WHEN IT'S EASY TO IGNORE EVERYTHING GOING ON UNTIL IT
20:28:18  HAPPENS TO YOU.
IT'S NOT UNTIL YOUR OWN PEOPLE ARE HARMED
20:28:21  THAT YOU CARE.
EARLIER THIS YEAR WITH THE
20:28:24  CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC, PEOPLE BEGAN BLAMING
20:28:27  AND TURNING ON THE ASIAN COMMUNITY, HORRIFIC AND UNSPEAK
20:28:30 ABLE ACTS OF VIOLENCE AGAINST ASIANS IN SAN FRANCISCO.
IT
20:28:34  TRULY HURT TO SEE HOW PEOPLE SPREAD HATE AND LACKED EMPATHY
20:28:37  AND RESPECT FOR EACH OTHER.
EVEN AS A HIGH
20:28:40  SCHOOL STUDENT, I COULD SEE THAT.
PEOPLE ONLY SAW THEIR  DIFFERENCES, THEIR RACE
20:28:43  AND CULTURAL BACKGROUND.
THAT WAS IN THE PAST.
NOW I WANT TO MAKE A STAND
20:28:46  FOR CHRISTINA LU'S INCIDENT.
SHE WAS A HERO WHO
20:28:49  STOOD UP AGAINST RACIAL DISCRIMINATION BUT ENDED UP BEING A
20:28:52  VICTIM OF A RACIALLY MOTIVATED ATTACK.
NOW IT'S MY TURN
20:28:56  TO CARE, STAND UP AND FIGHT FOR HER, BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND.
ALTHOUGH
20:28:59  HOWEVER SMALL MAY SEEM, I HOPE TO MAKE AN IMPACT WITHIN MY
20:29:02  COMMUNITY TO ENCOURAGE FELLOW STUDENTS, ASIAN AMERICANS AND RESIDENTS
20:29:05  OF FREMONT ALIKE TO SHOW A COMMITMENT AND DEDICATION TO
20:29:08  A FREE SOCIETY WITHOUT DISCRIMINATION.
I'M ORGANIZE
20:29:11 ING A PEACEFUL PROTEST WITH THE POLICE APPROVAL ON
20:29:14  DECEMBER 11TH AT FREMONT CITY HALL AND I HOPE TO SPREAD MY MESSAGE
20:29:17 , ESPECIALLY TO THE YOUNG GENERATION OF STUDENTS WHO WILL
20:29:21  SHAPE THE FUTURE OF OUR COMMUNITY AND SOCIETY.
TO SPREAD THE IMPORTANCE
20:29:24  OF EMPATHY AND RESPECT, FOR PEOPLE TO COME TOGETHER
20:29:27  INSTEAD OF TURNING AGAINST ONE ANOTHER AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, CARE FOR ONE
20:29:30  ANOTHER, BECAUSE IF WE DON'T, THEN WHO WILL?
THANK YOU.

20:29:36 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU FOR THE COMMENT.
UNFORTUNATELY
20:29:41 , I'M SAD TO SAY THAT ASIAN HATE IS NOT
20:29:44  SOMETHING THAT IS NEW IN OUR HISTORY
20:29:47 .
AS WE HAVE SEEN THE INTOURNAMENT
20:29:50  OF THE JAPANESE AND CHINESE EXCLUSION AK.
THAT'S WHY
20:29:54  IT'S VERY IMPORTANT AS COLLECTIVE THAT WE'VE
20:29:57  ASKED FOR FUNDING FROM THE STATE AND ALSO
20:30:00  FROM THE SCHOOL DISTRICT, I HAVE TO SAY PERSONALLY SEE
20:30:03 ING THIS OVER THE YEARS AND ESPECIALLY
20:30:06  WHEN THIS CONVERSATION BEGAN
20:30:10  WITH SOME OF THE HATRED WE SAW TO OUR BUSINESSES AND TO
20:30:13  OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS, IT WAS JUST SAD AND SO
20:30:16  ABSOLUTELY, WHEN JUST THIS LAST WEEK WE STOOD AGAINST
20:30:19  ANTISEMITISM IN OTHER AREAS, WE WANT TO STAND FOR ALL OF OUR
20:30:22  COMMUNITY AND THAT'S WHY IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE SPEAK UP ON THIS
20:30:26 , AND WE MUST, AS
20:30:29  YOU SAID, AMPLIFY IT.
I REGRET THAT I WILL NOT BE ABLE TO
20:30:32  JOIN YOU FOR YOUR RALLY BECAUSE SOME OF OUR COUNCILMEMBERS ARE
20:30:35  DANCING IN THE NUTCRACKER THAT EVENING, BUT WE CERTAINLY WILL BE STANDING WITH YOU
20:30:38  IN SOLIDARITY AND SUPPORT EMOTIONALLY FOR THAT.

20:30:43 OTHER ITEMS THAT I THINK ARE ALSO VERY IMPORTANT I WANTED TO NOTE NOW
20:30:47  THAT WE'VE FINISHED PUBLIC COMMENT
20:30:50  IS THAT TONIGHT I'M ALSO MAKING SOME APPOINTMENTS
20:30:53  TO OUR COMMISSIONS.

20:30:59 I'M HOPING PEOPLE WILL CONTINUE TO APPLY FOR THEM.
SO I'M
20:31:02  MAKING APPOINTMENTS TO THE ALAMEDA
20:31:05  COUNTY MOSQUITO ABATEMENT, THE ART REVIEW BOARD, REGIONAL PARK
20:31:08  DISTRICT, ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, GEORGE PATTERSON
20:31:12  HISTORICAL ARCHITECTURAL REVIEW BOARD,
20:31:15  HUMAN RELATIONS COMMISSIONS, LIBRARY COMMISSION, MOBILITY COMMISSIONS
20:31:19 , PLANNING COMMISSION, AS WELL AS
20:31:22  RECREATION COMMISSION AND SENIOR CITIZENS COMMISSION AND YOUTH ADVISORY
20:31:26 .
SO WE WILL BE ADDING MORE COMMISSIONERS AND
20:31:30  SO I'D LIKE TO
20:31:34  CONTINUE WITH THAT AND ASK THAT WE MOVE THIS FORWARD.

20:31:39 AND IF I CAN GET A VOTE
20:31:43  FOR  THAT, PLEASE?
COUNCILMEMBER
20:31:46  SHAO?

20:31:50 >> Councilmember Shao: SO MOVED.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

20:31:54 >> Councilmember Keng: I WILL SECOND.
>> Mayor Mei: SECONDED BY
20:31:57  COUNCILMEMBER KENG.
ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE.

20:32:03 I THINK WE JUST HAVE TO APPROVE IT, RIGHT?
IF I
20:32:05  REMEMBER CORRECTLY.
WE HAVEN'T MADE COMMISSION APPOINTMENTS.

20:32:08 I WANTED TO NOTE ONE OTHER THING THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT
20:32:12  FOR  THEM --
20:32:15  EXPIRE SO WE NEED TO THEN ASK PEOPLE TO APPLY AGAIN.
YES.

20:32:18 GO AHEAD, MS. PFAU
20:32:22  GAUTHIER.
>> Ms. Gauthier: OKAY.
COUNCILMEMBER COX
20:32:25 , AYE.
COUNCILMEMBER SHAO, AYE.
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN
20:32:28 , AYE.
COUNCILMEMBER JONES,
20:32:32  AYE.
COUNCILMEMBER KENG, AYE.
VICE MAYOR SALWAN
20:32:35 , AYE.
MAYOR MEI, AYE
20:32:38 .
>> Mayor Mei: SO THE MOTION PASSES UNANIMOUSLY.

20:32:42 AND SO I'LL TAKE
20:32:46  SOMETHING ELSE -- I THINK ONE PERSON'S NAME MIGHT BE MISSING
20:32:49 , I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED BUT
20:32:52  I'LL FOLLOW UP WITH THAT SEPARATELY.
BUT WE WILL BE MAKING ADDITIONAL
20:32:56  APPOINTMENTS AT THE NEXT MEETING SO IF YOU HAVE NOT APPLIED AND ARE INTERESTED,
20:32:59  I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO GET OUR VOICE OUT THERE AND FOR PEOPLE TO
20:33:02  PARTICIPATE ON DIFFERENT  AREAS.
SO THANK YOU.

20:33:07 AT THIS TIME, I ALSO WANTED TO MENTION THAT SEVERAL OF
20:33:10  OUR COUNCILMEMBERS AND OTHERS SERVE ON DIFFERENT
20:33:13  COMMISSIONS, AND I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S ANY REPORT OUT ON THE COMMISSIONS
20:33:16  THEMSELVES.
WE'VE HAD A LOT OF MULTICULTURAL EVENTS HERE
20:33:19  IN THE COMMUNITY, AND THAT'S WHY IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US
20:33:23 , WE'VE HAD THE LIGHTING OF THE MENORAH, TRI-CITY
20:33:27  INTERFAITH THANKSGIVING, AND OTHER CELEBRATIONS
20:33:31 .
BUT I DEFINITELY AGREE WITH SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE THIS 
20:33:34 EVENING, WHICH IS THAT WE HAVE MORE IN COMMON THAN WE
20:33:37  HAVE IN DIFFERENCE, AND SO THAT HOPEFULLY WE CAN STAND IN SOLIDARITY
20:33:41  WITH ONE ANOTHER.
ARE THERE ANY REPORT OUT FOR ANY
20:33:44  OF THE COMMISSIONS FROM
20:33:47  THE COUNCILMEMBERS?
OKAY.
THANK YOU.

20:33:51 SEEING NONE, I WILL ADJOURN THE MEETING.
I WISH
20:33:54  YOU ALL SAFETY AND  HEALTH, AND I LOOK FORWARD TO SPEAKING WITH YOU
20:33:57  ALL NEXT WEEK.
AND PARTICIPATING IN THIS PROCESS.
AND
20:34:01  AGAIN, I ASK THE COUNCILMEMBERS TO PLEASE ENCOURAGE
20:34:04  YOUR COMMUNITY DISTRICT REPRESENTATIVES TO
20:34:06  PARTICIPATE IN OUR REDISTRICTING PROCESS.
THANK YOU.
