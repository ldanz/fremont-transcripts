19:00:44 

19:02:43  I SEE THAT WE HAVE A COUNCILMEMBER WITH A HAND RAISE THED.
19:02:47   RAISED.
19:02:48 
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN?
19:02:53 
>> Councilmember Kassan: I DON'T NEED TO PULL AN ITEM BUT FOR 2C, I WOULD 
19:03:03 LIKE TO RECORD MY VOTE AS A NO VOTE BECAUSE I DO BELIEVE WE SHOULD BE SCREENING OUR INVESTMENTS ACCORDING TO 
19:03:11 ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE STANDARDS, SO IF I CAN JUST HAVE THAT RECORDED AS A NO VOTE.
19:03:14 
>> Mayor Mei: AND THEN THE REST OF THE CONSENT CALENDAR, YOU DON'T HAVE ANY 
19:03:17 --
>> Councilmember Kassan: NO, I COULD MOVE TO APPROVE THE CONSENT CALENDAR 
19:03:18 WITH THAT CAVEAT.
19:03:22 
>> Mayor Mei: NOTED FOR COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN.
19:03:24 
SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER JONES.
19:03:25 
I SAW HIS HAND RAISED.
19:03:30 
MAY I PLEASE GET A ROLL CALL VOTE?
19:03:31 
>> Ms.
19:03:32  Gauthier: YES, MADAME MAYOR.
19:03:35 
COUNCILMEMBER COX, AYE.
19:03:37 
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN, AYE.
19:03:39 
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, AYE.
19:03:42 
COUNCILMEMBER JONES, AYE.
19:03:45 
COUNCILMEMBER KENG, AYE.
19:03:48 
VICE MAYOR SHAO, AYE.
19:03:55 
MAYOR MEI, AND THEN I HAVE REFLECTED 2C, THE MANAGING INVESTMENTS WITH 
19:03:56 KASSAN VOTING NO.
19:03:57 
>> Mayor Mei: YES, AYE.
19:04:02 
SO THE CONSENT CALENDAR PASSES WITH UNANIMOUS VOTE EXCEPT FOR ON CONSENT 
19:04:04 ITEM NUMBER 2C, FOR COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN.
19:04:10 
WONDERFUL.
19:04:10

19:06:59 I'D LIKE TO GIVE A FEW MINUTES TO OUR HUMAN RELATIONS COMMISSIONER, MARTY.
19:07:00 
WELCOME, MARTIN.
19:07:04 
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH, MAYOR MEI.
19:07:06 
GOOD EVENING TO YOU AND MEMBERS OF THE CITY COUNCIL.
19:07:11 
I'M JOINED BY MY FELLOW HUMAN RELATIONS COMMISSIONERS AND LGBTQ 
19:07:15 COMMITTEE MEMBERS, TEJINDER DHAMI AND DHARMINDER DEWAN.
19:07:20 
AS A PROUD GAY MAN AND WITH THEIR SUPPORT, I THANK YOU FOR PROCLAIMING 
19:07:21 THIS MONTH AS PRIDE MONTH.
19:07:26 
THIS PROCLAMATION CONFIRMS THE DEDICATION THAT FREMONT HAS FOR ITS 
19:07:28 LGBTQ+ COMMUNITY.
19:07:32 
PRIOR TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, FREMONT HAS HAD AN ENTRY IN SAN 
19:07:41 FRANCISCO'S PRIDE PARADE WHERE MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY, BOTH LGBTQ+ PEOPLE, ALLIES AS WELL AS LOCAL OFFICIALS 
19:07:45 COULD BE SEEN MARCHING IN SOLIDARITY AS ONE CONTINGENT.
19:07:50 
WHILE THERE WILL NOT BE A PARADE THIS YEAR I LOOK FORWARD TO THE DAY -- AS 
19:07:57 THE HOME OF  TRANSVISION, FREMONT IS A PLACE OF DIGNITY FOR OUR TRANS SISTERS AND BROTHERS.
19:08:03 
THEIR WORK IS ESSENTIAL IN PROVIDING HEALTHCARE IN THE BAY AREA.
19:08:08 
THE COMMITMENT OF LGBTQ+ PEOPLE IS QAWPT FIED BY THE HUMAN RIGHTS 
19:08:10 CAMPAIGNS SCORE OF 90 OUT OF 100.
19:08:13 
WHILE THERE IS ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT IN THIS NUMBER, IT PROVIDES A BENCHMARK 
19:08:16 FROM WHICH OUR COMPASSIONATE CITY CAN GROW.
19:08:21 
PRIDE IS THE OPPOSITE OF SHAME, AND FREMONT'S AFFIRMATION OF VISIBILITY, 
19:08:29 DIGNITY, AND EQUALITY FOR ITS LGBTQ+ COMMUNITY IS BOTH NEEDED AND DESERVED.
19:08:30 
THIS PRIDE MONTH.
19:08:37 
I ENCOURAGE EVERYONE TO SHOI THEIR ALLYSHIP BY RAISING AND DISPLAYING THE 
19:08:44 PRIDE FLAG BY MARKING THE TRANSGENDER DAY OF REMEMBRANCE, DONATING TO A PRO LGBTQ+ CAUSE AND PARTICIPATING IN 
19:08:48 CREATING A MORE EQUITABLE AND INCLUSIVE COMMUNITY IN OUR CITY.
19:08:48 
THANK YOU.
19:08:55 
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU, MARTIN, AND ALL OF THE FELLOW COMMISSIONERS OF THE 
19:08:59 HUMAN RELATIONS COMMISSION FOR JOINING US IN THIS, AS WELL AS OUR FELLOW COUNCILMEMBERS.
19:09:02 
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS RECOGNITION.
19:09:10 
NEXT IS OUR PUBLIC COMMUNICATION AND I WANT TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY SPEAKERS ON 
19:09:11 THAT AND I SEE WITH HAVE A COUPLE.
19:09:15 
AND THIS IS FOR ITEMS THAT ARE NON-AGENDIZED ON THE CALENDAR THIS 
19:09:16 EVENING.
19:09:30 
THE FIRST SPEAKER IS ARDIE.
19:09:31 
WELCOME.
19:09:32 
>> THANKS, MADAME MAYOR.
19:09:33 
CAN YOU HEAR ME?
19:09:37 
>> Mayor Mei: YES.
19:09:43 
PLEASE PROCEED.
19:09:48 
>> MADAME MAYOR, CAN YOU HEAR  ME?
19:09:49 
>> YES.
19:09:50 
>> OKAY, GREAT.
19:09:50 
THANK YOU.
19:09:52 
THIS IS ARDIE WITH ST.
19:09:52  ANTON.
19:09:55 
WE'RE AN ACTIVE AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPER IN CALIFORNIA.
19:09:59 
I THINK WE'RE THE FIRST OR SECOND MOST ACTIVE AND WE'RE PLEASED TO HAVE 
19:10:09 COMPLETED THE WARM SPRINGS BART STATION INNOVIA AFFORDABLE HOUSING COMMUNITY THAT'S 290 UNITS OF VERY LOW AND LOW 
19:10:15 INCOME HOUSING, ALL HAVE BEEN FULLY OCCUPIED SINCE AUGUST OF LAST YEAR, SO WE'RE COMING UP ON 10 MONTHS AND THE 
19:10:21 CITY REALLY HAS BEEN A LEADER IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING POLICY, CREATIVE POLICY  ENACTMENT AND ENFORCEMENT BOTH 
19:10:26 IN YOUR HOUSING ELEMENT AND THROUGH YOUR STAFF LEADERSHIP, EVERYBODY HAS DONE A GREAT JOB BUT I'M HERE BEFORE 
19:10:27 YOU THIS EVENING PLEADING FOR YOUR HELP.
19:10:31 
THIS PROJECT HAS BEEN OPEN NOW FOR NEARLY 10 MONTHS, ALMOST A YEAR.
19:10:36 
OUR AMENITIES ARE READY, THEY'RE READY TO BE OPENED, ESPECIALLY WITH SUMMER 
19:10:42 COMING UP, THE SWIMMING POOL, CLASSROOM AMENTS, THE AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMMING, THE GYMNASIUM, THE OTHER ON-SITE 
19:10:48 FACILITIES, THEY'RE ALL READY TO GO, AND WE NEED TO OPEN THEM AND WE CAN'T OPEN THEM WITHOUT A FINAL CERTIFICATE 
19:10:51 OF OCCUPANCY, AND WE'VE BEEN WORKING HAND IN HAND WITH YOUR STAFF.
19:10:56 
THERE WERE SOME MINOR ISSUES RELATED TO THE EXECUTION OF A PUBLIC PARK THAT 
19:11:02 WE BUILT, FRANKLY DUE TO COVID, LACK OF INSPECTION AVAILABILITY, LACK OF SUPPLY, LACK OF MANPOWER.
19:11:05 
THAT PARK TOOK MUCH LONGER THAN EXPECTED.
19:11:09 
YOU'VE SEEN THAT WITH THE BART BRIDGE, IT'S TAKEN YEARS LONGER THAN EXPECTED, 
19:11:14  EVERYWHERE IN THE COUNTRY NOW IS SUFFERING FROM THAT, BUT UNFORTUNATELY, BECAUSE OF THE DELAY IN 
19:11:16 THE PARK WHICH IS NOW DONE, NONE OF THESE AMEN ITS ARE AVAILABLE.
19:11:21 
WE CAN'T PROCEED TO OPERATE OUR COMMUNITY LIKE IT NEEDS TO BE 
19:11:29 OPERATED, BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, THE STATE HAS GIVEN RELIEF TO TENANTS, HAS GIVEN RELIEF TO LENDERS BUT HASN'T 
19:11:31 GIVEN RELIEF TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING  DEVELOPERS.
19:11:36 
WE HAD THESE VERY, VERY STRICT MILESTONES WHERE TOAD TODAY WE NEEDED 
19:11:39 OUR FINAL CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY SO THE PROJECT WOULD NOT.
19:11:40 
>> INTO ANY RISK OF FORECLOSURE.
19:11:45 
UN14THLY WE WERE NOT ABLE TO RECEIVE IT, WE THINK IT'S VERY CLOSE, 
19:11:51 HOPEFULLY TOMORROW OR THE DAY AFTER, IT MAY BE AVAILABLE, BUT UNLESS IF WE GET THAT, THERE IS SOME JEOPARDY TO THE 
19:11:59 PROJECT FOR GOING INTO FORECLOSURE, WE'RE JUST HOPEFUL SINCE YOU'VE DONE SO MUCH FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING, LAST 
19:12:04 MONTH WAS AFFORDABLE HOUSING MONTH, YOU'VE DELIVERED MORE UNITS THAN MANY REGIONS IN THE STATE.
19:12:08 
I'M HOPING YOU CAN DIRECT YOUR CITY MANAGER AND OTHER STEEN YOUR STAFF TO 
19:12:14 REALLY WORK WITH US OVER THE NEXT DAY OR TWO TO GET THIS, WE WILL PUT UP ANY SECURITY THE CITY NEEDS, I THINK THE 
19:12:17 FINAL REMAINING ITEM IS A MONUMENT SIGN IN THE PUBLIC  PARK.
19:12:21 
THINGS LIKE THAT ARE WHAT'S LEFT BUT IT'S JEOPARDIZING THE LONG TERM 
19:12:24 OPERATIONAL ABILITY OF THIS COMMUNITY, AND WE'RE HOPEFUL THAT YOU CAN HELP.
19:12:26 
I KNOW IT'S NOT AGENDIZED.
19:12:28 
I REALLY WANTED TO GET ON THE PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD.
19:12:29 
NEVER HAVE DONE THIS.
19:12:32 
WE'VE BEEN SUCCESSFUL FOR 35 YEARS, 13,000 UNITS.
19:12:36 
THIS HAS NEVER HAPPENED, BUT WE'RE HOPEFUL YOUR CITY MANAGER AND OTHERS 
19:12:41 WILL CONTACT US TOMORROW AND WORK WITH US SO WE CAN CONTINUE TO BE SUCCESSFUL PROVIDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THE 
19:12:41 CITY OF FREMONT.
19:12:43 
THANK YOU FOR YOUR  CONSIDERATION.
19:12:54 
>> Mayor Mei: I WILL SAY THAT WE'VE NOTED THIS AND I'M SURE THAT -- I SEE 
19:13:02 CITY MANAGER MARK DANAJ AS WELL AS DAN, AND I WILL HOPE THAT TOMORROW WE CAN WORK ON SOMETHING THAT CAN MOVE US 
19:13:09 FORWARD BECAUSE WE ARE HAPPY TO BE PARTICIPATING IN BOTH THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING MONTH AND ACTUALLY WE JUST 
19:13:17 RELEASED A  NOFA, NOTICE OF FUNDING AVAILABILITY TO WORK ON MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING.
19:13:17 
SO THANK YOU.
19:13:21 
SPEAKING OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND SOME OF THE OTHER ITEMS, WE'RE GOING 
19:13:27 TO BE TALKING AND WE HAVE A PRESENTATION THIS EVENING FROM HANS LARSEN, WHO IS OUR PUBLIC WORKS 
19:13:33 DIRECTOR, WHO WILL PROVIDE A PRESENTATION AND IT'S AN UPDATE ON A DISCUSSION WE HAD PREVIOUSLY TALKING 
19:13:35 ABOUT  DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEES.
19:13:38 
THANK YOU FOR JOINING US THIS EVENING.
19:13:39 
>> Mr.
19:13:41  Larsen: THANK YOU, MAYOR MEI AND MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL.
19:13:44 
THE PURPOSE OF THIS ITEM IS TO RECOMMEND APPROVAL OF AN UPDATE TO THE 
19:13:47 CITY'S DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEE PROGRAM.
19:13:54 
AS YOU KNOW, THE CITY CHARGES FEES TO NEW DEVELOPMENT TO HELP PROVIDE THE 
19:14:01 CITY'S CAPITAL INFRASTRUCTURE, AND THIS RELATES TO OUR INFRASTRUCTURE ASSOCIATED WITH PARKS, TRANSPORTATION, 
19:14:03 AND CITY'S BUILDINGS.
19:14:12 
AS YOU RECALL, WE HAD A PRESENTATION AND A DISCUSSION WITH COUNCIL BACK IN 
19:14:17 MARCH, WHERE WE PROVIDED YOU AN UPDATE ON THIS TOPIC AND SOUGHT YOUR DIRECTION ON SOME KEY POLICY ISSUES.
19:14:23 
AND SO I'LL GO THROUGH OUR RECOMMENDATION, BUT JUST AS A 
19:14:33 REFRESHER, DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEES ARE ENABLED BY STATE LAW, THEY ARE FEES THAT PAY FOR NEW
19:14:38  FACILITIES THAT WE CAN PROVIDE TO THE COMMUNITY THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH DEVELOPMENT GROWTH, AND UNDER STATE 
19:14:44 LAW, THE FEES MUST HAVE A PROPORTIONALITY TO THE LEVEL OF GROWTH, OR IN OTHER WORDS, YOU CAN'T 
19:14:57 USE DEVELOPMENT FEES TO FIX THINGS WE ALREADY HAVE, SO IT HAS TO GO FOR -- AS NOTED, WE HAVE FIVE IMPACT FEES, 
19:15:01 TWO ASSOCIATED WITH PARKS, ONE FOR PARKLAND ACQUISITION, ONE FOR ACTUALLY DEVELOPING PARKS.

19:15:11 WE HAVE ONE FOR TRANSPORTATION, WE HAVE A DEDICATED FEE FOR OUR FIRE FACILITIES, AND THEN A GENERAL CAPITAL 
19:15:17 FACILITY FEES THAT GOES TOWARDS OTHER CITY BUILDINGS.
UNDER STATE LAW, WE ARE REQUIRED TO 
19:15:24 REPORT ON HOW WE USE THE FUNDS, AND THEN EVERY FIVE YEARS, WE NEED TO DO A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW AND UPDATE OF THE 
19:15:33 FEE PROGRAM, AND THAT IS THE TOPIC BEFORE YOU HERE THIS EVENING.
SO AGAIN, WE DISCUSSED THIS A FEW 
19:15:42 MONTHS BACK WITH YOUR DIRECTION, WE REVIEWED A PROPOSAL WITH DEVELOPMENT STAKEHOLDERS THAT WE NOTICED THROO YOU 
19:15:49  THROUGH OUR COMMUNICATION CHANNELS, AND WE'RE HERE TONIGHT TO FORMALLY HAVE A PUBLIC  HEARING TO CONSIDER 
19:15:54 APPROVAL OF AN UPDATE OF OUR FEE PROGRAM.
JUST IN THE WAY OF CONTEXT, THE 
19:16:04 DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEES REPRESENT ABOUT HALF OF THE CITY'S CAPITAL PROGRAM, SO IT'S A VERY SIGNIFICANT COMPONENT OF 
19:16:11 OUR CAPITAL BUDGET.
AND THEN YOU CAN SEE THE DISTRIBUTION TYPICALLY THAT WE'VE HAD FOR THE FEES, 
19:16:19 FOR THE FIVE PROGRAMS, YOU KNOW, THE LARGEST THREE AREAS ARE FOR  PARKLAND ACQUISITION, PARK DEVELOPMENT, AND 
19:16:28 TRANSPORTATION.
WHEN WE PRESENTED TO YOU BACK IN MARCH, WE IDENTIFIED A FEW BASIC 
19:16:38 ADJUSTMENTS TO MAKE.
ONE IS A INFLATIONARY ADJUSTMENT BASED ON PAST PRACTICE EVERY YEAR, WE DO A 
19:16:45 UPDATE TO FEES BASED ON THE CONSTRUCTION COST INDEX.
AND THE PURPOSE OF THIS IS TO MAKE 
19:16:51 SURE THAT THE FEES KEEP UP WITH THE COST OF INFLATION.
IT'S NOTED THAT IS NOT THE SAME INDEX 
19:16:58 AS THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX.
IT'S SPECIFICALLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE COST OF CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS AND 
19:17:08 LABOR.
AND BASED ON PUBLISHED INFORMATION, THE INFLATIONARY FACTOR FOR INFLATION 
19:17:13 IS 4.84%.
WE ALSO IDENTIFIED THE NEED TO UPDATE OUR WAREHOUSE FEE.

19:17:25 WAREHOUSING IS USED MORE EXTENSIVELY THESE DAYS AS DISTRIBUTION CENTERS AND MANY WAREHOUSES IS A RETAIL OR OFFICE 
19:17:30 COMPONENT ASSOCIATED WITH THEM.
SUCH AS THE LIVING SPACES EXAMPLE SHOWN IN THIS PHOTO.

19:17:39 AND SO WE ARE PROPOSING TO ADJUST THE WAREHOUSE FEE TO CORRESPOND WITH THE LEVEL OF USE AND TRAFFIC THAT THEY'RE 
19:17:47 GENERATING IN THESE TIMES.
WE ALSO SUGGESTED MAKING SOME MINOR ADJUSTMENTS TO THE FEES.

19:17:56 ONE WAS TO INCREASE THE FIRE FEE TO MATCH THE STANDARDS OF COVER, WHICH WAS RECOMMENDED IN AN EARLIER COUNCIL 
19:18:01 REPORT.
WE ARE ALSO INCREASING THE FEES FOR CIVIC FACILITIES UP TO THE MAXIMUM 
19:18:09 NEXUS LEVEL, SO THAT WE HAVE MORE RESOURCES TO DO THINGS THAT ARE NEEDED SUCH AS EXPANSION OF THE POLICE CENTER 
19:18:18 AND OTHER CITY BUILDING FACILITIES.
AND THEN AS SOMEWHAT OF AN  OFFSET TO IT, WE IDENTIFIED THE NEED TO -- OR 
19:18:30 THE ABILITY TO LOWER CURRENT FEES FOR PARKLAND ACQUISITION.
WE THEN PRESENTED TO COUNCIL SOME KEY 
19:18:34 POLICY TOPICS.
SORT OF FIRST AND FOREMOST WAS THE QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER WE WANTED TO 
19:18:41 HAVE SOME INCENTIVES FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING BY  OFFERING A DISCOUNT IN FEES TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS, 
19:18:48 AND WE PRESENTED SOME EXAMPLES OF HOW OTHER JURISDICTIONS ARE  DOING THIS.
COUNCIL PROVIDED VERY STRONG SUPPORT 
19:18:58 FOR THIS TOPIC, AND WE'RE RECOMMENDING A 50% REDUCTION IN FEES FOR OUR  LARGEST PROGRAMS, PARKS AND 
19:19:08 TRANSPORTATION, BUT NOT THE TWO SMALLER PROGRAMS, CIVIC FACILITIES AND FIRE, AND THAT'S IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO KIND 
19:19:13 OF INCREASE INVESTMENT LEVELS FOR THOSE PROGRAMS.
WHAT THIS WILL DO, BASED ON SOME 
19:19:20 PROJECTIONS OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT, IS IT WILL SAVE ABOUT $9 MILLION OVER THE NEXT FIVE-YEAR 
19:19:30 PERIOD, WHICH IS SIGNIFICANT.
OF COURSE IF YOU REDUCE MONEY IN ONE AREA, IT ALSO COMES AS -- IT HAS AN 
19:19:38 IMPACT IN OTHER PROGRAMS.
SO SPECIFICALLY WANT TO DISCLOSE THAT THE $9 MILLION IN SAVINGS TRANSLATES 
19:19:44 INTO A $7 MILLION REDUCTION FOR PARK CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS AND $2 MILLION FOR TRANSPORTATION.

19:19:52 THIS HAS BEEN BUILT INTO THE PROPOSED CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM THAT'S WORKING THROUGH ITS APPROVAL PROCESS.

19:19:59 WE ASKED COUNCIL THE QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER WE WANTED TO INCREASE FEES FOR PARKS AND TRANSPORTATION.

19:20:06 WE DO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT WITHIN THE NEXUS LIMITS, BUT THERE WAS AN EXPRESSED INTEREST FROM COUNCIL TO 
19:20:17 KEEP FEES AT A RELATIVELY MANAGEABLE CONSISTENT LEVEL AND SO WE'RE NOT PROPOSING ANY INCREASE IN THOSE TWO 
19:20:23 AREAS.
AS AN OFFSET TO THAT, WE DID HAVE A DISCUSSION AND WE HAD OTHER 
19:20:30 DISCUSSIONS ABOUT PURSUING ALTERNATIVE WAYS TO MEET OUR CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT NEEDS, AND THIS IS VERY TYPICAL FOR 
19:20:37 MOST CITIES TO INCLUDE -- TO FUND THEIR CAPITAL PROGRAMS THROUGH OTHER MEASURES SUCH AS A REVENUE ENHANCEMENT 
19:20:46 PROGRAM AND COUNCIL INDICATED SUPPORT TO EXPLORING THAT, AND WE'LL BE COMING BACK TO COUNCIL AT ANOTHER TIME WITH A 
19:20:55 WORK PLAN TO LOOK AT ALTERNATIVE REVENUE SOURCES.
SO WITH THAT COUNCIL DIRECTION, WE MET 
19:21:03 WITH THE DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY, AND THIS SLIDE HERE KIND OF INDICATES HOW YOU TRANSLATE THE ADJUSTMENTS THAT ARE 
19:21:08 BEING PROPOSED.
SO THIS INCLUDES THE REDUCTION FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING, THE INFLATIONARY 
19:21:16 INCREASE, AND THE OTHER ADJUSTMENTS THAT I INDICATED.
AND SO YOU'LL SEE A RELATIVELY SMALL 
19:21:28 INCREASE TO MOST OF THE FEE, LARGELY A REFLECTION OF THE INFLATIONARY FEES AND SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION FOR 
19:21:33 AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS, SO YOU SEE THE CHANGE THAT'S RECOMMENDED HERE.
AND THEN ALSO A NOTABLE JUMP IN THE 
19:21:40 WAREHOUSE FEE.
SO WE PRESENTED THIS TO  DEVELOPMENT STAKEHOLDERS, WE HAD A VIRTUAL MEETING 
19:21:47 WITH THEM ON MARCH 25TH.
AND KIND OF THE OVERWHELMING FEEDBACK WE GOT WAS STRONG SUPPORT FOR THE 
19:21:56 AFFORDABLE HOUSING REDUCTION.
MOST OF THE STAKEHOLDERS THAT SPOKE WERE RELATED TO FOLKS REPRESENTING 
19:22:02 AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS.
WE HAD SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT THE WAREHOUSE FEE, AND THEN FROM A GENERAL 
19:22:09 INDUSTRY PERSPECTIVE, THEY APPRECIATED KIND OF THE APPROACH THAT WE WERE KEEPING FEES CONSISTENT, AND I THINK 
19:22:16 FOR DEVELOPERS, THEY DO A LOT OF ADVANCED PLANNING AND FEES ARE PART OF THEIR EQUATION, AND SO THEY VERY MUCH 
19:22:25 VALUE THAT WE'RE NOT MAKING SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN FEES, AND SO THAT'S KIND OF THE GENERAL FEEDBACK AND ADVICE 
19:22:33 THAT THEY PROVIDED.
SO WE'RE HERE, WE THINK WITH A PROGRAM THAT IS AS WIDELY SUPPORTED BY 
19:22:42 STAKEHOLDERS, REFLECTS THE COUNCIL DIRECTION, SO WE DO NEED TO CONDUCT A PUBLIC HEARING ON THIS TOPIC, MAKE 
19:22:51 FINDINGS THAT THIS PROGRAM IS EXEMPT FROM CEQA REVIEW, AND THEN THE NEW FEE STRUCTURE IS FORMALLY ADOPTED AS PART 
19:23:00 OF A RESOLUTION.
IF COUNCIL APPROVED THIS  TONIGHT, UNDER STATE LAWS, THE FEES CAN'T GO 
19:23:09 INTO EFFECT SOONER THAN 60 DAYS THEREAFTER, SO THE EFFECTIVE DATE WOULD BE ON AUGUST 2ND.

19:23:13 THE OTHER NOTES ON THE BOTTOM OF THE SLIDE ARE JUST A RECAP OF WHAT THE KEY CHANGES ARE THAT ARE RECOMMENDED.

19:23:21 SO THAT CONCLUDES MY PRESENTATION.
WE DO HAVE A TEAM OF STAFF HERE AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY  QUESTIONS 
19:23:26 THAT THE COUNCIL HAS.
THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:23:29 AT THIS TIME, I'D LIKE TO TURN IT BACK TO THE COUNCIL FOR ANY CLARIFYING QUESTIONS.

19:23:38 FOR OUR PUBLIC WORKS DIRECTOR OR TEAM.
OKAY, SEEING NONE, I BELIEVE WE HAVE A PUBLIC SPEAKER ON THIS ITEM.

19:23:46 AND I'D LIKE TO CALL OUR FIRST PUBLIC SPEAKER, AND -- ACTUALLY TWO -- THREE.

19:23:52 WE'LL START WITH LINDA  MANDOLINI, PLEASE.
WELCOME, LINDA.

19:23:55 GOOD EVENING.
>> THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR, MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL.

19:24:01 I AM SO GRATEFUL TO THE LEADERSHIP OF THE CITY OF FREMONT ON AFFORDABLE HOUSING, AND AS YOU KNOW, -- HAS BEEN 
19:24:08 WORKING WITH THE CITY FOR A VERY LONG TIME, SINCE THE EARLY 1980s.
WE JUST OPENED LAST WEEK RILEY STATION 
19:24:12 AND CANYON FLATS.
THE COST OF FEES ARE REALLY IMPORTANT TO US, AND WE REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR 
19:24:16 LEADERSHIP AND THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION TO REDUCE THE FEES FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING.

19:24:24 IT'S SUPER CRITICAL FOR US RIGHT NOW.
A GOOD PORTION OF OUR COMPETITION AT THE STATE LEVEL FOR TAX CREDITS RELY 
19:24:29 ON OUR ABILITY TO KEEP OUR COSTS AS LOW AS WE CAN, RECOGNIZING THAT WE WANT TO BUILD A HIGH QUALITY PRODUCT.

19:24:34 AND SO I WON'T SPEND A LOT OF TIME ON THIS, BUT JUST TO  UNDERSCORE HOW IMPORTANT THIS IS AND HOW MUCH WE 
19:24:37 APPRECIATE YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS AND WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO KEEP THAT PROVISION IN THIS  RECOMMENDATION.

19:24:50 THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
AND THE NEXT SPEAKER IS LILIAN  
19:24:52 LEW-HAILER.
WELCOME.
>> THANK YOU.

19:25:01 GOOD EVENING, COUNCILMEMBERS.
I'M WITH MIDPEN HOUSING.
I WANT TO ECHO LINDA'S SUPPORT FOR THE 
19:25:05 FEE SCHEDULE IN FRONT OF YOU THIS EVENING AND, IN PARTICULAR, THE DISCOUNT TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING.

19:25:14 MIDPEN IS PROUD TO HAVE PARTNERED WITH THE CITY ON OVER 470 PERMANENT AFFORDABLE HOMES HERE IN FREMONT.

19:25:24 THE FEE SCHEDULE AHEAD OF YOU AND THE DISCOUNT MAKES AFFORDABLE HOUSING MORE FINANCIALLY FEASIBLE TO BUILD AND AS 
19:25:31 LINDA MENTIONED, MORE COMPETITIVE TO BRING STATE RESOURCES INTO FREMONT.
IN TERMS OF BOTH BEING COST-EFFICIENT, 
19:25:36 BUT ALSO IN TERMS OF BEING PRO-HOUSING, WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT THE STATE IS INCREASINGLY LOOKING FOR.

19:25:42 I APPRECIATE THE STAFF AND CITY COUNCILMEMBERS' ONGOING LEADERSHIP IN AFFORDABLE  HOUSING, AND YOUR EFFORTS 
19:26:48 TO ENSURE THAT EVERYONE IN OUR COMMUNITY HAS A SAFE, AFFORDABLE PLACE TO LIVE, AND HOPE THAT YOU WILL 
19:26:51 CONTINUE WITH THE DISCOUNT AS PROPOSED BY STAFF.
THANK YOU.

19:26:59 >> Mayor Mei: THE NEXT SPEAKER IS DENNIS MARTIN.
WELCOME, DENNIS.

19:27:08 >> THANK YOU, MAYOR, AND GOOD EVENING, COUNCIL.
DENNIS MARTIN SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF 
19:27:16 BIA BAY AREA.
I WANTED TO JUST MAKE A COUPLE OF COMMENTS IN SUPPORT OF THE STAFF 
19:27:26 RECOMMENDATION.
STAFF HAS BEEN GOOD IN  OUTREACHING TO THE DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY FOR YEARS, 
19:27:37 AND WE DO APPRECIATE THAT OUTREACH AND THAT OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE FEEDBACK FOR POLICIES, FEES, ET CETERA THAT 
19:27:46 COME BEFORE THE CITY COUNCIL.
THIS IS A MODERATE PROPOSAL, A MODERATE FEE INCREASE, AND I THINK 
19:27:55 THAT MR. LARSEN IS  CORRECT, THAT DEVELOPERS DO SEEK CONSISTENCY IN FEES AND FEE INCREASES, AND IT'S IMPORTANT 
19:28:04 FOR THE CITY COUNCIL TO RECOGNIZE THAT WHEN FEES ARE INCREASED AS THEY WILL FROM YEAR TO YEAR, THAT IT BE ON A 
19:28:13 MODERATE BASIS, AND NOTHING SHOCKING TO THE DEVELOPMENT INDUSTRY TO TRY TO GRAPPLE WITH TO PENCIL THEIR 
19:28:20 PROJECTS.
FINALLY, I DO WANT TO SUPPORT THE -- I DO WANT TO SAY BIA DOES SUPPORT THE 
19:28:25 REDUCTION FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN FEES.
I THINK IT'S VERY, VERY IMPORTANT THAT 
19:28:35 THE COUNCIL ADOPT THIS, AND SUPPORT AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT, NOT ONLY 100% AFFORDABLE HOUSING  
19:28:45 PROJECTS, BUT ALSO INCLUSIONARY UNITS THAT MARKET RATE  DEVELOPERS MAYBE REQUIRED OR CONSIDERED BUILDING IN 
19:28:53 THEIR PROJECTS.
SO I WANTED TO TAKE THIS TIME TO REGISTER THAT SUPPORT AND THANK YOU 
19:29:01 FOR ACCEPTING THESE COMMENTS.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU FOR ALL THE SPEAKERS THIS EVENING, AND AT THIS 
19:29:09 TIME, I'LL TURN IT BACK TO THE COUNCIL FOR COMMENTS AND I SEE COUNCILMEMBER COX FOLLOWED BY COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN.

19:29:19 >> Councilmember Cox: THANK YOU.
I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT THE STAFF HAS DONE A REALLY WONDERFUL JOB IN 
19:29:27 LISTENING TO OUR COMMENTS FROM THE LAST MEETING BACK IN MARCH, AND I'M READY TO MAKE A MOTION TO MOVE FORWARD WITH 
19:29:32 THIS PROPOSAL.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
I'D LIKE TO HEAR FROM THE OTHER 
19:29:36 COUNCILMEMBERS.
I SEE COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN.
DID YOU STILL WANT TO MAKE A COMMENT 
19:29:37 OR --
>> Councilmember Kassan: NO, THAT'S OKAY.

19:29:40 I CHANGED MY MIND.
THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY.

19:29:43 COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN.
>> Councilmember Salwan: THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR.

19:29:49 WELL, I, TOO, WOULD LIKE TO THANK STAFF AND FOR ALL THE WORK THEY'RE DOING.
WHAT I REALLY LIKE ABOUT THIS IS THAT 
19:29:56 WE'RE ACTUALLY DOING SOMETHING TO REDUCE THE BARRIERS FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING, SO I THINK THIS WILL 
19:30:02 DEFINITELY HELP WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO, WHICH IS BUILD MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS, SO THIS IS A CONCRETE 
19:30:06 STEP THAT WE CAN TAKE AS A COUNCIL THROUGH POLICY THAT CAN HAVE IMPACT FOR THE FUTURE.

19:30:14 SO I STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
VICE MAYOR SHAO.

19:30:22 >> Vice Mayor Shao: THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR.
I AGREE WITH COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN.

19:30:36 WE JUST TOOK A STEP FURTHER INTO INTRODUCING MORE AND MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS IN FREMONT BY INCREASING 
19:30:45 THE DEVELOPMENT FEE FOR REGULAR MARKET RATE UNITS, AND BY REDUCING THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS, WE ACTUALLY 
19:30:55 PROVIDE AN INCENTIVE FOR THE DEVELOPERS AND THE DEVELOPER COMMUNITIES TO WORK WITH THE CITY GOVERNMENT IN BUILDING 
19:31:01 AND PROVIDING MORE AFFORDABLE UNITS.
AND I WOULD LIKE TO ALSO THANK THE STAFF FOR THEIR HARD WORK.

19:31:09 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
AND I SEE THAT WE HAD THE MOTION FROM COUNCILMEMBER COX.

19:31:14 I JUST WANTED TO ECHO -- I SEE COUNCILMEMBER KENG RAISED HER HAND FIRST.

19:31:20 IT'S LIKE A JEOPARDY, BUT I WAS GOING TO FINISH MAKING MY COMMENTS, WHICH IS THAT I SEE THAT WE'VE HAD THESE 
19:31:25 CONVERSATIONS MANY TIMES AND CERTAINLY IN THIS CURRENT CLIMATE, WHERE IT'S BEEN CHALLENGING BECAUSE OF COVID 
19:31:33 IMPACTS ON COST OF MATERIALS AND LABOR, AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT LOOKS AT OUR HOUSING ELEMENTS AND RESIDENTIAL 
19:31:37 HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT, IT REALLY HELPS US TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THE TYPES OF HOUSING THAT WE'RE HOPING TO 
19:31:44 CREATE AND THAT'S WHY FOR OUR CITY'S HISTORY, THE LAST TWO YEARS, I THINK WE'VE BUILT RECORD NUMBER OF 
19:31:50 AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND I KNOW WE'RE ALSO STRUGGLING AND LOOKING AT DIFFERENT WAYS TO INCENTIVIZE AND HAVE 
19:31:54 PROGRAMS AVAILABLE FOR MODERATE HOUSING, WORKFORCE HOUSING IN THE FUTURE.

19:32:00 BUT THIS IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION, AND I APPRECIATE MY FELLOW COUNCILMEMBERS FOR ALL THEIR COMMENTS 
19:32:06 AND I APPRECIATE STAFF FOR TAKING THEM INTO CONSIDERATION AS WELL AS THE SPEAKERS THIS EVENING, WHO'VE SHARED 
19:32:10 THIS VISION.
AND SO I'M ALSO VERY HAPPY TO SUPPORT THAT AND I SAW THE MOTION BY 
19:32:16 COUNCILMEMBER COX AND THE SECOND BY COUNCILMEMBER  KENG, AND IF WE COULD HAVE A ROLL CALL VOTE, AND I THINK 
19:32:22 IT'S SOMETHING, FROM WHAT I HEAR, ALL OF THE COUNCIL IS VERY SUPPORTIVE.
THANK YOU.

19:32:31 ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE.
>> Ms. Gauthier: COUNCILMEMBER COX, AYE, ABSOLUTELY.

19:32:36 COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN, AYE, COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, AYE, COUNCILMEMBER JONES, AYE, 
19:32:41 COUNCILMEMBER KENG, AYE, VICE MAYOR SHAO, AYE.
MAYOR MEI, AYE.

19:32:49 AND THIS MOTION PASSES UNANIMOUSLY.
SO CONGRATULATIONS TO THE COUNCIL AND TO OUR FUTURE OF HOPEFULLY BUILDING 
19:32:55 MORE HOMES, NOT JUST HOUSES BUT HOMES, FOR PEOPLE WHO MUCH NEED THEM IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND FOR THOSE 
19:32:59 PARTNERSHIPS.
AND I ENCOURAGE -- I KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS I SAW IN THERE WAS TALKING 
19:33:04 ABOUT COMMUNITY  BENEFITS.
IF ANYONE WANTS TO STEP UP AND HELP US WITH MORE, WE ALWAYS WELCOME THAT 
19:33:07 TOO.
SO WE'RE HERE TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN IT COMES TO THE HOUSING, IT'S NOT JUST 
19:33:11 THE HOUSING, THE HOME, IT'S THE WRAP-AROUND SERVICES THAT ARE NEEDED TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO LIVE 
19:33:15 WELL.
SO THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR TIME THIS EVENING ON THIS AGENDA  ITEM.

19:33:26 NEXT IS ITEM 5B, WHICH IS SAFE PARKING HOST SITE ORDINANCE.
I KNOW WE HAVE COURTNEY PAL, WHO IS 
19:33:32 JOINING US THIS EVENING, PLANNER II, AS WELL AS LAURIE FLORES, WHO IS OUR HOMELESS SERVICES MANAGER.

19:33:36 AND THEY WILL BE PROVIDING A PRESENTATION THIS EVENING.
WELCOME, COURTNEY AND LAURIE.

19:33:42 >> THANK YOU.
GOOD EVENING, MADAME MAYOR, HONORABLE COUNCIL MEMBERS.

19:33:48 THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THIS EVENING TO PRESENT THE PROPOSED HOST SITES ORDINANCE FOR TEMPORARY OVERNIGHT 
19:33:52 PARKING.
I'M LAURIE FLORES, THE HOMELESS SERVICES MANAGER, AND MY COPRESENTER 
19:33:59 IS COURTNEY PAL, CITY PLANNER, ALSO IN ATTENDANCE AND AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS ARE SUZANNE SHENFIL, HUMAN SERVICES 
19:34:05 DIRECTOR, AND WAYNE MORRIS, COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT DEPUTY DIRECTOR.
WE'LL START OUR PRESENTATION WITH 
19:34:11 INFORMATION ON THE  HOMELESSNESS CRISIS IN FREMONT TO PROVIDE THE FRAMEWORK AND CONTEXT OF SAFE PARKING AS A TOOL 
19:34:17 TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS.
AND WE WILL BRIEFLY REVIEW AN OVERALL SAFE PARKING STRATEGY, BEFORE PRESENT 
19:34:23  PRESENTING THE MATTER BEFORE YOU TONIGHT, WHICH IS THE PROPOSED SAFE PARKING HOST SITE ORDINANCE.

19:34:27 SOME OF THIS DATA MAY LOOK FAMILIAR TO YOU.
HOMELESSNESS IS A CRISIS.

19:34:33 IT IS A GROWING CRISIS IN THE STATE AND BAY AREA.
CALIFORNIA HAS 12% OF THE U.S. 
19:34:41 POPULATION BUT IT ACCOUNTS FOR 27% OF THE NATION'S HOMELESS POPULATION.
IN ALAMEDA COUNTY, FOR EVERY ONE 
19:34:45 INDIVIDUAL OR HOUSEHOLD TRANSITIONING INTO STABLE HOUSING, THREE OTHERS ARE BECOMING HOMELESS.

19:34:54 OUR CURRENT DATA AVAILABLE FROM THE 2019 POINT IN TIME COUNT SHOWS US THAT FREMONT HAS A 27% INCREASE IN OVERALL 
19:35:01 HOMELESSNESS SINCE 2017, WHICH INCLUDES PEOPLE LIVING IN SHELTERS AND UNSHELTERED LOCATIONS NOT MEANT FOR 
19:35:06 HUMAN HABITATION.
HOWEVER, IF WE LOOK SPECIFICALLY AT THE TWO-YEAR GROWTH RATE OF THE 
19:35:14 UNSHELTERED HOMELESSNESS, THAT NUMBER TRIPLES TO A 72% INCREASE OF PEOPLE LIVING IN LOCATIONS NOT MEANT FOR 
19:35:19 HUMAN HABITATION.
WITH THE CURRENT PANDEMIC, AS EVICTION MORATORIUMS ARE LIFTED BY THE STATE 
19:35:24 AND LOCAL JURISDICTIONS, THERE IS GREAT SPECULATION THAT THE NUMBER OF UNSHELTERED PEOPLE ON OUR STREETS WILL 
19:35:31 INCREASE.
IN 2018, FREMONT JOINED MANY BAY AREA MUNICIPALITIES IN DECLARING A SHELTER 
19:35:36 CRISIS.
IT'S NOT ONLY AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF THE CHALLENGES WE FACE AS A SOCIETY, BUT 
19:35:44 ALSO PROVIDED A FRAMEWORK TO DEVELOP AND  CREATE -- SORRY, TO DEVELOP AND PROVIDE CREATIVE SHELTER AND INTERIM 
19:35:49 HOUSING PROGRAMS, INCLUDING OUR HOUSING NAVIGATION CENTER.
MORE RECENTLY, THE ONSET OF THE 
19:35:55 COVID-19 PANDEMIC HAS SHOWN THE WORLD THAT THE ABILITY TO SHELTER PEOPLE BY USING VACANT HOTELS AND ALLOWING THEM 
19:36:02 TO ISOLATE INDOORS IS A HEALTH MEASURE AND KEY TO PREVENTING THE SPREAD OF AN ILLNESS FATAL TO OUR MOST VULNERABLE 
19:36:05 COMMUNITY MEMBERS.
IT WILL TAKE OUR COMMUNITY TO COME TOGETHER TO UNDERSTAND AND HELP 
19:36:13 RESOLVE THE PROBLEM WITH CREATIVE SOLUTIONS AND PARTNERSHIPS.
THE CITY OF FREMONT IS ADDRESSING THE 
19:36:17 HOMELESS CRISIS THROUGH MANY APPROACHES THAT FALL INTO THE FOLLOWING CATEGORIES.

19:36:23 HOMELESSNESS PREVENTION THROUGH RENTAL ASSISTANCE OR TENANCY SUSTAINABILITY, TO HELP THOSE MOST ECONOMICALLY AT 
19:36:28 RISK AT BECOMING HOMELESS MAINTAIN THEIR HOUSING.
INTERIM HOUSING AND STREET LEVEL 
19:36:34 SERVICES PROVIDE STABILIZATION THROUGH SHELTER AND QUALITY OF LIFE SERVICES IN SUPPORT OF A TRANSITION INTO STABLE 
19:36:42 HOUSING.
AND ENCAMPMENT MANAGEMENT.
ALL OF THESE APPROACHES HAVE 
19:36:47 CONNECTIONS AND LINKAGES TO SUPPORTIVE SERVICES LIKE COUNSELING AND HOUSING NAVIGATION.

19:36:54 SAFE PARKING IS A TOOL TO OFFER A SAFE AND STABLE LOCATION FOR PEOPLE TO PARK AND CONNECT WITH SERVICES.

19:37:00 SAFE PARKING PROGRAMS CAN TAKE MANY FORMS, BUT WHAT IS CONSISTENT IS THE ABILITY FOR PEOPLE TO KNOW WHERE THEY 
19:37:05 CAN GO TO REST, ACCESS HYGIENE FACILITIES, AND REINTEGRATE INTO A COMMUNITY.

19:37:11 THE NEEDS OF PEOPLE UTILIZING EXISTING SAFE PARKING PROGRAMS MAY VARY, LIKE THE NEEDS OF ALL PEOPLE.

19:37:16 SOME MAY NEED APPROPRIATE REST TO SEARCH AND PREPARE FOR EMPLOYMENT, SOME NEED TO BE ABLE TO STUDY FOR 
19:37:25 SCHOOL, AND SOME NEED ADDITIONAL SUPPORT TO APPLY FOR HOUSING.
THE TEAM FROM COMMUNITY  DEVELOPMENT 
19:37:30 AND HUMAN SERVICES DEPARTMENTS VISITED SAFE PARKING PROGRAMS THROUGHOUT THE EAST AND SOUTH BAY.

19:37:39 WE CONDUCTED CITY-WIDE PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT AND OUTREACH TO VEHICLE DWELLERS.

19:37:47 THE THREE-PRONG STRATEGY WAS PROPOSED TO COUNCIL IN FEBRUARY OF 2021.
THE STRATEGY SEEKS TO IMPLEMENT AN 
19:37:52 ORDINANCE ALLOWING PUBLIC AND PRIVATE LOTS THE FLEXIBILITY TO HOST NEIGHBORS LIVING IN THEIR VEHICLES, IDENTIFY AND 
19:37:59 MONITOR ON-STREET SAFE PARKING ZONES FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE NO OTHER LOCATION TO SAFELY PARK, AND PROPOSE A 
19:38:08 CITY-OPERATED LARGE SCALE SAFE PARKING LOT MORE ACCESSIBLE FOR LARGER VEHICLES TO ACCESS SERVICES AND AMEN 
19:38:11 ITS.
ON FEBRUARY 16TH, COUNCIL DIRECTED STAFF TO MOVE FORWARD WITH DEVELOPING 
19:38:18 A SAFE PARKING HOST SITE PROGRAM AND TO RETURN WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE OTHER TWO PRONGS OF THE 
19:38:24 STRATEGY AT A LATER DATE.
SINCE RECEIVING THAT DIRECTION, STAFF REVIEWED CURRENT MODELS MADE POSSIBLE 
19:38:31 FROM A HOST SITE ORDINANCE, HELD ROUTINE WORKSHOPS WITH THE FAITH COMMUNITY, AND SOUGHT INPUT FROM 
19:38:36 MULTIPLE CITY DEPARTMENTS, INCLUDING POLICE, FIRE, PUBLIC WORKS, ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES AND COMMUNITY 
19:38:43 SERVICES.
MOUNTAIN VIEW CURRENTLY HAS THE LARGEST SAFE PARKING PROGRAM.

19:38:51 THE CITY PARTNERED WITH  NON-PROFIT AND LOCAL FAITH-BASED ORGANIZATIONS TO OFFER OVERNIGHT PARKING AT MULTIPLE 
19:38:58 LOTS THROUGHOUT THE CITY.
THIS WAS POSSIBLE BECAUSE OF AN EXISTING COLLABORATION.

19:39:02 WE LEARNED IN MOUNTAIN VIEW THAT AN ORGANIC SENSE OF RESPONSIBILITY AND COMMUNITY CAN DEVELOP THROUGH THESE 
19:39:06 PROGRAMS.
INITIALLY THEY OFFERED STAFF MONITORING ALL NIGHT, BUT FOUND THERE 
19:39:11 WAS NO LONGER A NEED FOR IT BETWEEN 11:00 P.M. AND 6:00 A.M., WHEN MOST PEOPLE WERE SLEEPING.

19:39:18 THE CITY OF SAN JOSÉ OFFERS A SAFE PARKING PERMIT TO PRIVATE AND FAITH-BASED LOTS WHO WANT TO BE A HOST 
19:39:24 SITE FOR AN OVERNIGHT PROGRAM.
HOST SITES MUST CONFORM TO CITY STANDARDS TO RECEIVE A PERMIT WE 
19:39:33 LEARNED THAT A GROUP OF  FAITH-BASED ORGANIZATIONS WORKED COLLABORATIVELY TO EACH OBTAIN A PERMIT.

19:39:38 WE LEARNED ABOUT A SIMILAR PROCESS IN SARATOGA, WHERE FAITH-BASED ORGANIZATIONS CAME TOGETHER IN 
19:39:45 PARTNERSHIP WITH A SERVICE PROVIDER TO OFFER SAFE PARK PROGRAMS AT THEIR SITES ON A MONTHLY BASIS, THEY CHANGED 
19:39:56 LOCATIONS EACH MONTH OR EVERY TWO -- BALANCE THE HOSTING RESPONSIBILITY THROUGHOUT THE COMMUNITY AND ALLOW 
19:40:06 EACH SITE TO PROVIDE SUPPORT IN DIFFERENT WAYS.
AS MENTIONED EARLIER,  HOMELESSNESS IS 
19:40:11 NOT A PROBLEM THAT CAN BE SOLVED BY THE CITY ALONE.
IN MANY COMMUNITIES, FAITH-BASED 
19:40:17 ORGANIZATIONS FACILITATE SAFE PARKING PROGRAMS AND SOME HAVE EVEN INITIATED SUCH PROGRAMS.

19:40:23 HERE IN FREMONT, OUR FAITH COMMUNITY HAS PROVIDED SERVICES AND SUPPORT FOR UNHOUSED NEIGHBORS FOR DECADES.

19:40:29 IT WAS A NATURAL NEXT STEP FOR STAFF TO ENGAGE THE COMMUNITY FOR THEIR INPUT EARLY ON IN THE PROCESS TO UNDERSTAND 
19:40:37 THEIR QUESTIONS AND FEEDBACK ON A HOST SITE PROGRAM CONCEPT.
SINCE FEBRUARY, STAFF MET WITH FAITH 
19:40:45 LEADERS AND  REPRESENTATIVES ON A WEEKLY BASIS TO BUILD COLLABORATION AND SUPPORT FOR IMPLEM TAITION.

19:40:49 THESE LINKED THE GROUNDWORK FOR PARTNERSHIP TO HELP US WORK ON THE PROBLEM.

19:40:55 WE LEARNED ABOUT THE SARATOGA MODEL DESCRIBED EARLIER, WE ALSO DISCUSSED THE IMPORTANCE OF FOSTERING COMMUNITY, 
19:41:02 FELLOWSHIP, NATURAL SUPPORTS AND CONSUMER VOICES IN ANY PROGRAM.
IN OUR FINAL MEET, WE DISCUSS A 
19:41:09 PROCESS BY WHICH TO COORDINATE RESOURCES AND VOLUNTEERISM BETWEEN ORGANIZATIONS, AND WE WORKED TOGETHER 
19:41:14 TO DEVELOP AND REVIEW THE SAFE PARKING HOST SITE ORDINANCE.
IT BECAME EVIDENCE THAT FOR A 
19:41:20 SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS ORDINANCE, THROUGH A ROTATIONAL PROGRAM, THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE CITY 
19:41:26 STAFF  DESIGNATED TO HELP COORDINATE THE PROGRAM AS A LIAISON FOR SITES AND TO REFER, SCREEN AND SUPPORT PROGRAM 
19:41:32 PARTICIPANTS.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME REVIEWING THE BACKGROUND ON OUR HOMELESS CRISIS AND 
19:41:36 THE PATH WE TOOK TO ARRIVE BEFORE YOU THIS EVENING.
I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE COURTNEY PAL, 
19:41:42 CITY PLANNER, WHO WILL NOW WALK YOU THROUGH THE PROPOSED ORDINANCE.
>> THANK YOU, LAURIE, AND GOOD 
19:41:46 EVENING, MAYOR MEI AND CITY COUNCILMEMBERS.
MY PORTION OF THE PRESENTATION TONIGHT 
19:41:53 WILL TAKE YOU THROUGH THE ORDINANCE THAT STAFF HAS DEVELOPED TO ALLOW SAFE PARKING HOST SITES AT NON-PROFIT 
19:41:59 ASSEMBLY AND PUBLIC FACILITIES.
THE ORDINANCE WE'VE DEVELOPED CAN BE CONCEPTUALIZED AS HAVING FOUR MAIN 
19:42:04 COMPONENTS.
FIRST, THE ORDINANCE ADDS A DEFINITION FOR SAFE PARKING SITE INTO THE 
19:42:10 MUNICIPAL CODE.
SECOND, THE ORDINANCE ADDRESSES WHERE SAFE PARKING HOST SITES ARE PERMITTED 
19:42:17 IN THE CITY.
THIRD, IT ESTABLISHES A MINISTERIAL OR STAFF LEVEL PERMITTING PROCESS TO 
19:42:23 CREATE SAFE PARKING HOST SITES, AND FINALLY, IT ESTABLISHES OBJECTIVE PERFORMANCE STANDARDS THAT THESE SITES 
19:42:31 MUST FOLLOW IN ORDER TO RECEIVE A SAFE PARKING HOST SITE PERMIT.
FIRST, I'LL DISCUSS THE ZONING MER 
19:42:36  PERMISSIONS.
CURRENTLY, SAFE PARKING IS NOT A DEFINED OR ALLOWED USE IN THE 
19:42:41 MUNICIPAL CODE, WHICH MEANS THAT IT'S EFFECTIVELY NOT ALLOWED ON ANY PRIVATE LAND.

19:42:49 THE ORDINANCE WOULD ALLOW SAFE PARKING HOST SITES AS AN ACCESSORY USE TO PRIVATE ASSEMBLY USES AND QUASI PUBLIC 
19:42:56 FACILITIES, INCLUDING NON-PROFIT EDUCATIONAL, RELIGIOUS, RECREATIONAL, CHARITABLE, OR MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS 
19:43:00 THROUGHOUT THE CITY.
REGARDLESS OF THE ZONING DISTRICT IN WHICH THEY ARE LOCATED.

19:43:08 IT WOULD ALSO AUTHORIZE SAFE PARKING HOST SITE ON PUBLIC FACILITIES THAT ARE NOT ALREADY AUTHORIZED FOR SAFE 
19:43:16 PARKING PURSUANT TO STATE LAWS.
SECOND, THE ORDINANCE WOULD ESTABLISH A MINISTERIAL PERMITTING PROCESS FOR 
19:43:21 ORGANIZATIONS TO APPLY TO BECOME A HOST SITE.
THERE WOULD BE THREE REQUIREMENTS TO 
19:43:27 APPLY.
A SITE PLAN, SHOWING THE SITE AND THE PROPOSED LOCATION OF SAFE PARKING 
19:43:34 SPACES, AN OPERATION AND MANAGEMENT PLAN, WHICH WOULD PROVIDE DETAILS ON HOW THE SITE WILL BE RUN, AND FINALLY 
19:43:40 AN ON-SITE INSPECTION, COMPLETED BY CITY STAFF TO VERIFY THAT CONDITIONS ON THE SITE ARE SUITABLE FOR SAFE 
19:43:45 PARKING.
WE ANTICIPATE THAT STAFF WOULD WORK CLOSELY WITH ANY POTENTIAL APPLICANTS 
19:43:51 IN ORDER TO PUT TOGETHER THESE MATERIALS AND CREATE A PLAN THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH THE REQUIREMENTS 
19:43:57 ALREADY FOUND IN THE ORDINANCE.
ALREADY WE'VE PUT TOGETHER A DRAFT CHECKLIST TO HELP SIMPLIFY THE 
19:44:02 APPLICATION PROCESS AND MORE CLEARLY EXPLAIN THE  REQUIREMENTS, WHICH HAS BEEN INCLUDED IN YOUR PACKET TONIGHT 
19:44:08 AS INFORMATIONAL ITEM NUMBER 1.
AFTER A SAFE PARKING HOST SITE RECEIVES A PERMIT, THAT PERMIT WOULD 
19:44:16 BE VALID FOR ONE YEAR, AND THEN IT COULD BE MINISTERIALLY RENEWED THROUGH A PROCESS SIMILAR TO THE INITIAL 
19:44:23 INSPECTION AND REVIEW PROCESS BY CITY STAFF.
FINALLY, THE ORDINANCE SETS STANDARDS 
19:44:28 FOR THE OPERATION AND DESIGN OF SAFE PARKING HOST SITES.
THIS IS REALLY THE MEAT OF THE 
19:44:32 ORDINANCE, AND SO I WANT TO DIG IN TO ALL OF THE REQUIREMENT ONE BY ONE TO EXPLAIN THEIR IMPORTANCE.

19:44:38 SITES WOULD BE REQUIRED TO BE OPEN FOR SAFE PARKING AT LEAST 10 HOURS A NIGHT.

19:44:45 IN COLLABORATION WITH OUR  FAITH-BASED WORKING GROUP, WE DECIDED TO ALLOW HOST SITES TO SET THE SPECIFIC HOURS 
19:44:51 OF OPERATION THEMSELVES, IN ORDER TO ACCOMMODATE OTHER EVENING OR MORNING ACTIVITY ON THE SITE, WHICH WOULD VARY 
19:44:58 BASED ON THE ORGANIZATION IN QUESTION.
HOST SITES COULD, OF COURSE, CHOOSE TO BE OPEN FOR MORE THAN 10 HOURS A NIGHT 
19:45:03 IF THEY WISHED, AND STAFF WOULD CERTAINLY ENCOURAGE THEM TO DO SO IF FEASIBLE, GIVEN THE SITE OPERATIONS.

19:45:11 THIS COULD INCLUDE UP TO 24 HOURS OF OPERATION IF DESIRED.
HOST SITES WOULD BE OPEN TO OPERABLE 
19:45:15 VEHICLES ONLY.
VEHICLES WOULD NEED TO BE  REFERRED INTO THE PROGRAM.

19:45:26 LIKELY THROUGH CITY STAFF --
[INTERRUPTION]
 -- SORRY, LIKELY THROUGH CITY STAFF 
19:45:33 OR CITY PARTNERS AND ALSO RECEIVE A PERMIT FROM THE SITE OPERATOR.
I DO WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT VEHICLES 
19:45:40 WOULD NOT NEED A VALID STATE-ISSUED LICENSE OR REGISTRATION TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM, AND THAT'S TO REDUCE 
19:45:46 BARRIERS TO ACCESS, ALTHOUGH WE CERTAINLY HOPE THAT THEY WOULD BE PROVIDED ASSISTANCE IN OBTAINING THOSE 
19:45:51 DOCUMENTS WHILE PARTICIPATING IN SAFE PARKING.
UP TO 20 VEHICLES COULD PARK ON A 
19:45:58 SINGLE SITE AT ONCE.
THIS NUMBER COMES FROM SPEAKING WITH PROGRAM OPERATORS.

19:46:04 WE HAD INITIALLY THOUGHT ABOUT 3 TO 10 VEHICLES, WE HEARD FROM OTHERS WHO HAD SUCCESSFULLY MANAGED SAFE PARKING 
19:46:09 PROGRAMS THAT 15 TO 20 VEHICLES IS A SWEET SPOT FOR DEVELOPING COMMUNITY AMONG PARTICIPANTS, WHILE ALSO NOT 
19:46:17 BECOMING TOO LARGE FOR VOLUNTEERS TO MANAGE.
FINALLY, BEHAVIORAL STANDARDS SUCH AS 
19:46:23 QUIET HOURS AND PROHIBITIONS ON FIRE RISKY ACTIVITIES WOULD BE ENFORCED, AS YOU CAN READ IN THE LAST TWO BULLETS 
19:46:28 OF THE SLIDE.
ADDITIONAL PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS RELATE TO SITE DESIGN.

19:46:35 EACH SITE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE BASIC FACILITIES, INCLUDING RESTROOMS, WATER, AND TRASH FACILITIES.

19:46:43 THESE FACILITIES COULD BE PROVIDED EITHER THROUGH TEMPORARY, PORTABLE FACILITIES OR BY ALLOWING GUESTS TO 
19:46:47 USE FACILITIES WITHIN EXISTING BUILDINGS.
STAFF PLANS TO REALLOCATE A PORTION OF 
19:46:55 THE CDBG CARES ACT FUNDING IN ORDER TO ASSIST HOST SITES WITH PROVIDING TEMPORARY FACILITIES IF NEEDED.

19:47:02 ADDITIONALLY, IN COORDINATION WITH THE CITY'S FIRE MARSHAL, STAFF DEVELOPED ORDINANCE REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO FIRE 
19:47:08 SAFETY.
WITH REGARD TO FIRE SEPARATION, THERE WOULD NEED TO BE ONE OR TWO PARKING 
19:47:13 SPACES WORTH OF CLEARANCE BETWEEN VEHICLES PARKED AND OCCUPIED.
VEHICLES WOULD NEED TO PARK WITHIN 
19:47:22 EXISTING PARKING SPACES RATHER THAN IN DRIVE AISLES, AND PARKING COULD NOT BLOCK FIRE PROTECTION SYSTEMS LIKE 
19:47:28 FIRE HYDRANTS.
EACH VEHICLE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO HAVE A COMBINATION SMOKE AND CARBON 
19:47:33 MONOXIDE DETECTOR AND  RVs WOULD NEED A FIRE EXTINGUISHER.
AGAIN I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THESE 
19:47:36 REQUIREMENTS WERE DEVELOPED IN COORDINATION WITH THE CITY'S FIRE DEPARTMENT IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT THE 
19:47:44 SAFE PARKING SITES ARE, IN FACT, SAFE FOR THEIR GUESTS.
LASTLY, THE ORDINANCE SETS STANDARDS 
19:47:50 BETWEEN SAFE PARKING SPACES AND ADJACENT PROPERTY LINES.
THERE ARE TWO MAIN CONSIDERATIONS WHEN 
19:47:57 IT COMES TO THESE SETBACKS AND THOSE ARE FIRE SAFETY AND NOISE.
IN INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL 
19:48:03 DISTRICTS, WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THERE'S ENOUGH SEPARATION BETWEEN A VEHICLE AND AN ADJACENT BUILDING TO PREVENT A 
19:48:09 QUICK SPREAD OF FIRE.
THEREFORE, THE SET BACK BECOMES TAKEN -- 5 FEET.

19:48:15 IN RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS, THE MAIN CONCERN IS NOISE.
THE GENERAL PLAN AND ZONING ORDINANCE 
19:48:20 HAVE EXISTING STANDARDS FOR NOISE AT RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY LINES THAT MUST BE MAINTAINED.

19:48:27 STAFF LOOKED AT THE AVERAGE NOISE CREATED BY CONTINUOUSLY IDLING A CAR ENGINE AND RUNNING A GENERATOR, AND 
19:48:33 DETERMINED HOW FAR FROM THE PROPERTY LINE THOSE USES WOULD NEED TO BE IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN THE EXISTING NOISE 
19:48:38 STANDARD.
THE RESULTANT SET BACK WAS 20 FEET FOR CARS AND 40 FEET FOR RVs.

19:48:45 STAFF HAVE PROACTIVELY LOOKED TO SEE HOW THESE SETBACKS CAN IMPACT FEASIBILITY ON SITES ADJACENT TO 
19:48:50 RESIDENTIAL.
AND WHAT WE FOUND WAS THAT IN MOST CASES, THE SETBACK REQUIREMENT ONLY 
19:48:57 REMOVES THE FIRST ROW OF PARKING CLOSEST TO A RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY LINE FROM CONSIDERATION FOR SAFE PARKING.

19:49:03 INDEED IN MOST SAMPLE CASES THAT STAFF LOOKED AT, PROPERTIES WERE CONSTRAINED BY THE 20 VEHICLE PARKING LIMIT FAR 
19:49:10 BEFORE THEY WERE CONSTRAINED BY SETBACKS.
THE PLANNING COMMISSION  CONSIDERED 
19:49:17 THE ORDINANCE AT THEIR MEETING ON MAY 13TH, AND VOTED 7-0 IN FAVOR OF STAFF'S RECOMMENDATION TO ADOPT THE 
19:49:24 ORDINANCE WITH TWO  MODIFICATIONS.
FIRST, THAT THE ORDINANCE BE EXPANDED TO ALLOW SAFE PARKING IN ALL TYPES OF 
19:49:31 PRIVATE SITES, INCLUDING RESIDENTIAL, COMMERCIAL, AND INDUSTRIAL  SITES, AND SECOND THAT, COUNCIL CONSIDER REMOVING 
19:49:36 PERFORMANCE STANDARDS IN FAVOR OF PROVIDING THEM TO FACILITIES WITH GUIDELINES RATHER THAN REQUIREMENTS.

19:49:43 STAFF'S RECOMMENDATION TONIGHT FOR COUNCIL IS THE SAME AS OUR ORIGINAL RECOMMENDATION TO  PLANNING 
19:49:48 COMMISSION, WHICH FOLLOWS THE INITIAL DIRECTION THAT WE RECEIVED TO ALLOW SAFE PARKING AT ASSEMBLY AND  
19:49:55 QUASI-PUBLIC USES LIKE  FAITH-BASED FACILITIES, SUBJECT TO A MINISTERIAL PERMIT WITH PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.

19:50:02 STAFF RECOMMEND THAT CITY COUNCIL FIND THAT THE PROJECT IS EXEMPT FROM CEQA AND MAKE THE REQUISITE FINDINGS THAT 
19:50:06 THE PROPOSED ORDINANCE IS CONSISTENT WITH THE GENERAL PLAN AND FURTHERS THE WELFARE OF THE  CITY.

19:50:12 AND INTRODUCE THE ORDINANCE FOR ADOPTION.
STAFF IS NOW AVAILABLE FOR ANY 
19:50:16 QUESTIONS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE FOR US.
THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU FOR THE 
19:50:21 PRESENTATION.
AND AT THIS TIME, I'LL TURN TO THE COUNCIL TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY 
19:50:24 QUESTIONS.
CLARIFYING QUESTIONS FROM COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN.

19:50:31 AND I BELIEVE COUNCILMEMBER JONES.
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN?
>> Councilmember Kassan: I HAVE A FEW 
19:50:37 QUESTIONS.
LET'S SEE.
NUMBER ONE, HOW DID YOU COME UP WITH 
19:50:43 THE QUIET HOURS?
BECAUSE TO ME, THEY SEEM A LITTLE BIT TOO SHORT.

19:50:47 I MIGHT EXTEND THEM BY AN HOUR ON EITHER SIDE, BUT WHAT MADE YOU DECIDE ON THOSE QUIET HOURS?

19:50:57 >> SO THE QUIET HOURS CORRESPOND TO THE EXISTING NIGHTTIME HOURS IN THE ZONING ORDINANCE FOR KIND OF REDUCED NOISE 
19:51:06 ACTIVITY ADJACENT TO RESIDENTIAL USES, AND SO BECAUSE QUIET HOURS, NO GENERATORS ALLOWED, WE WANT TO KIND OF 
19:51:12 HAVE IT LINE UP TO OUR KIND OF MORE RESTRICTIVE NOISE HOURS WENT INTO EFFECT.

19:51:16 >> Councilmember Kassan: THAT MAKES SENSE.
YOU MENTIONED GENERATORS.

19:51:21 I AM CONCERNED ABOUT GENERATORS.
THERE'S A LOT OF ISSUES WITH A LOT OF KIND OF TYPICAL  GENERATORS IN TERMS 
19:51:27 OF AIR POLLUTION AND NOISE AND EVEN LIKE CARBON MONOXIDE POISONING AND THINGS LIKE THAT.

19:51:34 IS THERE ANYTHING WE COULD DO TO REGULATE THE TYPES OF GENERATORS USED OR POSSIBLY PURCHASE SOLAR POWER -- I 
19:51:41 ACTUALLY HAVE A CLIENT WHO MAKES SOLAR POWERED GENERATORS SO I KNOW THEY EXIST AND THEY'RE VEL EFFICIENT.

19:51:47 IS THERE ANYTHING WE COULD DO TO LIMIT THE USE OF THE KINDS THAT ARE VERY NOISY AND POLLUTING AND POSSIBLY 
19:51:51 DANGEROUS?
>> THAT'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT STAFF IS INTERESTED IN.

19:51:59 AS AN ASIDE, WHEN WE VISITED THE MOUNTAIN VIEW PROGRAM, ONE OF THE GUESTS THERE HAD ACTUALLY TAUGHT 
19:52:06 ALMOST EVERYONE IN THE SAFE PARKING PROGRAM HOW TO HOOK UP THEIR RV TO SOLAR POWER, AND IT WAS A GREAT 
19:52:11 EXAMPLE, YOU  KNOW, VERY QUIET, VERY CLEAN, REDUCED A LOT OF SAFETY RISKS WHEN DONE CORRECTLY.

19:52:17 SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'RE DEFINITELY INTERESTED IN REPLICATING IN ANY SAFE PARKING HOST SITE PROGRAM 
19:52:23 IN FREMONT.
WHAT WE UNDERSTAND, THOUGH, IS THAT GENERATORS DO PROVIDE A REALLY 
19:52:28 ESSENTIAL TOOL FOR MANY PEOPLE TO JUST COMPLETE BASIC LIFE FUNCTIONS, AND SO WE DIDN'T WANT TO REGULATE THAT IN THE 
19:52:33 ORDINANCE BECAUSE OF CONCERNS, WE DIDN'T WANT TO BE TOO RESTRICTIVE WITH REGARD TO, YOU KNOW, PREVENTING PEOPLE 
19:52:38 FROM BEING ABLE TO DO THEIR JOB REMOTELY OR, YOU KNOW, DO SCHOOL REMOTELY, BUT IT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING 
19:52:44 THAT WE'RE INTERESTED IN PROGRAMMATICALLY, ASIDE FROM THE ORDINANCE IN ADDRESSING IN THE SAFE 
19:52:50 PARKING HOST SITES.
>> Councilmember Kassan: OKAY.
ANOTHER QUESTION I HAD IS, WILL THERE 
19:53:00 BE A REQUIREMENT FOR A MANAGER TO BE ON SITE DURING THE TIME WHEN -- YOU KNOW, THE LATE NIGHT HOURS?

19:53:08 >> LAURIE, DID YOU WANT TO TAKE THAT QUESTION?
>> RIGHT NOW WE'RE WORKING OUT HOW TO 
19:53:15 DEVELOP A PROGRAM, BUT WE'RE RELYING ON THE MODELS THAT WE'VE SEEN IN OTHER CITIES AS WELL AS PROGRAMS WE'VE HELD 
19:53:22 HERE IN THE CITY, AND WE CERTAINLY WOULD HAVE STAFF OR A MONITOR AVAILABLE DURING INTAKE WHILE PEOPLE 
19:53:29 ARE COMING ON SITE, AND THEN IN THE HOURS IN THE MORNING AS PEOPLE ARE DEPARTING JUST TO ENSURE THAT THOSE 
19:53:37 COMING ON SIDE ARE REGISTERED IN THE PROGRAM, AND THEN DEVELOPING A SITE COORDINATOR OR AN ON CALL VOLUNTEER OR 
19:53:43 MONITOR IF ISSUES ARISE OVERNIGHT, THAT WOULD BE THE MINIMUM PRESENCE OF STAFF.

19:53:47 OR MONITORS.
>> Councilmember Kassan: SOMEONE WOULD NEED TO BE AVAILABLE TO BE ON CALL 
19:53:50 THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT.
>> YES.
>> Councilmember Kassan: AND I'M 
19:53:56 WONDERING IF YOU -- I'M SURE YOU DID BULL DID YOU CONSULT WITH THE POLICE DEPARTMENT ON WHETHER THEY HAD ANY 
19:54:04 CONCERNS ABOUT POSSIBLE SAFETY ISSUES?
I'M NOT SURE IF PEOPLE MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT MORE AT RISK BEING IN THEIR 
19:54:13 CARS, I WOULD WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE THERE WAS SAFE THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT.

19:54:19 WHAT WAS THE INPUT FROM THE POLICE DEPARTMENT ON POTENTIAL SAFETY ISSUES THAT COULD COME UP IN TERMS OF 
19:54:28 CRIMINAL ACTIVITY THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT?
>> WELL, I THINK ONE WAY TO MITIGATE 
19:54:36 THAT IS, AS NEW PEOPLE COME INTO THE PROGRAM, THEY'RE SUPPORTED WITH A VOLUNTEER OR MONITOR STAFF SO THEY'RE 
19:54:45 AWARE OF WHO IS ALSO PARTICIPATING IN THE PROGRAM AND MAKING SURE THEY HAVE INFORMATION WITH THEM VERY QUICKLY TO 
19:54:51 CALL THE APPROPRIATE PERSON IF AN ISSUE ARISES, AND JUST SO THAT ANYONE ON SITE KNOWS WHAT TO DO IN CASE OF ANY 
19:55:00 TYPE OF EMERGENCY, AND SO IT'S JUST THE PREPAREDNESS OF PEOPLE ON SITE AND THEN ANOTHER THING -- THIS QUESTION 
19:55:05 MIGHT COME UP IS WHEN IT COMES TO THE ACTUAL LOCATION, IT WOULDN'T BE PUBLISHED NECESSARILY, IT WOULD JUST 
19:55:11 BE KNOWN TO THE PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS AND THE HOST SITE TO PROTECT THE PRIVACY OF THE SITE AND THE 
19:55:15 PARTICIPANTS.
>> Councilmember Kassan: OKAY.
BECAUSE I JUST WONDER IF THE 
19:55:21 VULNERABILITY ABOUT PEOPLE SLEEPING IN THEIR CARS, OF COURSE PEOPLE ARE ALREADY DOING THAT SO -- LET'S SEE.

19:55:33 I HAD ONE MORE QUESTION AND THAT WAS -- YOU KNOW, I IMAGINE THAT, YOU KNOW, ALL OF OUR CITY SERVICES THAT ARE 
19:55:40 AVAILABLE WOULD BE OFFERED.
WOULD THERE BE A SPECIAL EFFORT TO HELP PEOPLE FIND PERMANENT HOUSING, 
19:55:46 THE PEOPLE THAT WERE USING THESE SITES?
>> I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT QUESTION.

19:55:52 SO ONE WAY WE'RE CONSIDERING TAKING IN REFERRALS IS ACTUALLY THROUGH SERVICE PROVIDERS THEMSELVES, SO THERE'S MANY 
19:56:00 PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT ENROLLED IN ANY TYPE OF HOUSING OR INTERIM TYPE OF PROGRAM BUT THEY ARE CONNECTED TO OUTREACH 
19:56:06 PROVIDERS OR HOUSING NAVIGATORS, AND WE WOULD WORK WITH THOSE SERVICE PROVIDERS TO BRING REFERRALS IN THE 
19:56:11 FIRST PLACE SO THEY'D ALREADY BE CONNECTED, BUT THOSE THAT AREN'T, WE WOULD CERTAINLY MAKE CONTACT WITH 
19:56:19 THEM, DO A SCREENING FIGURING OUT WHAT THEY'RE ELIGIBLE FOR AND WHO WE COULD CONNECT THEM WITH TO TRANSITION THEM 
19:56:23 INTO A BETTER SITUATION.
>> Councilmember Kassan: GREAT.
I'M SORRY, I HAVE ANOTHER COUPLE 
19:56:29 QUESTIONS I JUST REMEMBERED.
ONE IS, IF WE PASS THIS TONIGHT, WILL ANY OF THESE ACTUALLY HAPPEN?

19:56:39 IS THERE -- I KNOW THERE'S BEEN MIXED LEVELS OF INTEREST.
AS MUCH AS LOVE THIS ORDINANCE, IF IT 
19:56:46 DOESN'T RESULT IN ANY ACTUAL SAFE PARKING, THEN IT'S KIND OF A WASTE OF EVERYONE'S TIME, SO DO YOU HAVE ANY 
19:56:57 IDEA HOW LIKELY THIS IS TO ACTUALLY LEAD TO ACTUAL SAFE PARKING?
>> WELL, WE KNOW THIS IS AN ONGOING 
19:57:02 CONVERSATION.
RIGHT NOW MANY FAITH-BASED COMMUNITIES AND ORGANIZATIONS ARE TRYING TO 
19:57:09 RECOVER FROM THE MANY EFFECTS OF THE PANDEMIC, AND SO TO UNDERSTAND AND BE PATIENT AND WORK WITH THEM THROUGH 
19:57:17 THAT PROCESS, AND SO WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO  OUTREACH -- SORRY, I HEAR FEEDBACK.

19:57:24 OKAY.
SORRY.
TO CONTINUE TO COMMUNICATE WITH THESE 
19:57:31 GROUPS AND FIND OUT HOW THEY'D BE INTERESTED IN  SUPPORTING THE EFFORT, IT MIGHT NOT JUST BE THROUGH BEING AN 
19:57:37 ACTUAL HOST SITE, BUT PROVIDING VOLUNTEERS, SUPPORTING WITH CERTAIN AMENITIES, SUPPORTING PEOPLE WITH 
19:57:42 ISSUES THEY MIGHT HAVE WITH THEIR VEHICLES.
SO IT'S GOING TO BE A CONTINUING 
19:57:46 CONVERSATION, BUT WE ARE GOING TO BE PATIENT AS PEOPLE WORK THROUGH THE ONCOMING CHANGES IN REGARDS TO THE 
19:57:50 PANDEMIC.
>> Councilmember Kassan: OKAY.
AND NOW MY ACTUAL LAST QUESTION WHICH 
19:57:57 IS THAT, YOU KNOW, GIVEN THAT WE DON'T KNOW FOR SURE THAT THIS WILL LEAD TO HOST SITES, AND IF IT DOES, IT MIGHT 
19:58:07 TAKE A WHILE, WHAT IS BEING DONE TO LOOK AT THE SECOND AND THIRD PRONGS OF THE INITIAL RECOMMENDATION, ESPECIALLY 
19:58:15 THE SECOND PRONG, BECAUSE THAT ONE SEEMS LIKE ONE WE COULD IMPLEMENT FAIRLY QUICKLY AT NOT TOO MUCH COST.

19:58:21 I KNOW THAT THE COUNCIL WASN'T UNANIMOUS IN WANTING TO PUSH THAT FORWARD, BUT I WOULD LOVE TO SEE IF 
19:58:29 MAYBE THAT COULD BE SOMETHING WE WOULD TALK ABOUT TONIGHT BECAUSE I JUST DO THINK IT IS AN URGENT PROBLEM, JUST 
19:58:37 WAITING FOR THESE ORGANIZATIONS TO HOST SITES IS A LITTLE BIT RISKY IN TERMS OF WHETHER IT'S ACTUALLY GOING TO 
19:58:45 RESULT IN  HELPING PEOPLE.
>> CONSISTENT WITH THE COUNCIL DIRECTION FROM LAST TIME, WE ARE 
19:58:52 MOVING FORWARD WITH ADDITIONAL RESEARCH ON THE SECOND AND THIRD PRONGS.
WE DO HAVE KIND OF UPCOMING SOME 
19:58:58 OUTREACH PLANS TO GET SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION TO INFORM A FUTURE RECOMMENDATION TO COUNCIL ON THE 
19:59:03 SECOND OR THIRD PRONG.
SO WE ARE PREPARED TO COME BACK WITH THOSE AT A LATER DATE AS ORIGINALLY 
19:59:08 DIRECTED.
>> Councilmember Kassan: ANY ESTIMATE ON WHEN WE COULD GET -- FOLLOW UP ON 
19:59:17 THE SECOND PRONG PARTICULARLY?
>> SO I BELIEVE OUR PLAN RIGHT NOW IS TO COME BACK WITH BOTH THE SECOND AND 
19:59:22 THE THIRD PRONG FOR KIND OF A SIMULTANEOUS EVALUATION BEFORE COUNCIL BEFORE MOVING FORWARD WITH EITHER OF 
19:59:26 THEM.
WE DON'T HAVE A DATE YET FOR THAT KIND OF FOLLOW-UP.

19:59:31 I THINK A LOT OF IT WILL DEPEND ON OUTREACH AND WHAT WE HEAR FROM FOLKS LIVING IN THEIR VEHICLES REGARDING 
19:59:37 KIND OF WHERE WE WANT TO GO WITH THESE  PROGRAMS.
>> Councilmember Kassan: OKAY.

19:59:39 THANK YOU.
I'M DONE.
>> Mayor Mei: NEXT IS COUNCILMEMBER 
19:59:47 JONES.
>> THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR, AND THANK YOU, COURTNEY, FOR THE PRESENTATION.

19:59:52 A COUPLE OF CLARIFYING QUESTIONS AND ONE I'LL TAG ON TO SOMETHING COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN BROUGHT UP.

20:00:04 AND THAT WAS THE CONSULTATION WITH PD.
AND LAURIE, I BELIEVE IT WAS YOU THAT MENTIONED A -- YOU KNOW, WITH THE 
20:00:11 PRIVACY ISSUES, THERE WOULD BE PEOPLE ON THE LIST THAT WOULD BE GIVEN THE LOCATION ON AS AS-NEEDED BASIS.

20:00:16 IS PD ON THAT LIST FOR DISTRIBUTION SO THAT THEY KNOW WHERE THESE SITES ARE AND THEY CAN KIND OF PUT THE WORD OUT 
20:00:22 TO THE STAFF ON THE STREET THAT, HEY, THIS IS GOING ON AT THIS LOCATION TONIGHT, AND YOU KNOW, MAYBE SOME 
20:00:32 EXTRA DRIVE-BYES ARE APPROPRIATE OR JUST IF THEY'RE AWARE IF THEY GET A CALL FOR SERVICE THERE.

20:00:36 AND -- I'M SORRY, GO AHEAD.
>> I'M SORRY, I DIDN'T MEAN TO DO THAT.

20:00:41 BUT THE SHORT ANSWER, YES, BUT I'LL LET YOU CONTINUE WITH YOUR QUESTION.
I'M SORRY.

20:00:47 >> Councilmember Jones: WELL, ACTUALLY I HAD ANOTHER -- JUST ANOTHER PART OF THAT IS -- AND I KNOW FIRE IS COMING 
20:00:57 OUT AND DOING THE ON-SITE INSPECTIONS OR THE RECOMMENDATIONS, AND ARE WE INVOLVING PD IN THAT AS WELL FOR SOME 
20:01:00 OF THEIR PERSPECTIVES ON  IT?
>> I CAN TAKE THAT PART OF THE QUESTION.

20:01:08 SO YES, SO BOTH FIRE AND PD HAVE THE SIGN-OFFS ON THE ON-SITE INSPECTION.
WE WOULD WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT, YOU 
20:01:14 KNOW, IT'S AN INTERDISCIPLINARY PROCESS FOR THESE TO GET APPROVED.
THROUGH THE PERMITTING PROCESS.

20:01:20 >> Councilmember Jones: OKAY.
THEN A COUPLE OTHER QUESTIONS REGARDING SOME OF THE REQUIREMENTS, 
20:01:29 AND AGAIN COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN BROUGHT UP THE ISSUE OF GENERATORS.
THE NOISE THEY MAKE, THE CO2 THAT THEY 
20:01:34 PUT OUT.
AND I KNOW -- I MEAN, I OWN AN  RV, I KNOW THAT THEY'RE FAIRLY QUIET AND 
20:01:42 MOST PLACES THAT YOU PARK AN RV WILL REQUIRE YOU TO HAVE ALL OF THAT STUFF SHUT DOWN BY 10:00 P.M. SO YOU DON'T 
20:01:48 DISRUPT ANY OF YOUR NEIGHBORS.
BUT I DO UNDERSTAND THE CONCERN ABOUT THE EXHAUST, AND I NOTICE THAT ONE OF 
20:01:59 THE PROVISIONS WAS THAT WAS IT EVERY VEHICLE WAS GOING TO BE REQUIRED TO HAVE A CO2 AND SMOKE DETECTOR, AND  
20:02:08 RVs WILL HAVE TO HAVE A FIRE EXTINGUISHER.
IS THERE ANY FUNDING BUILT INTO THIS 
20:02:15 TO ASSIST THOSE PEOPLE, MAY MAYBE WE HAVE A CASE OF CO2 DETECTORS AT EACH SITE OR THAT FOLLOWS THE HOST SITE 
20:02:21 AROUND SO THEY CAN BE PASSED OUT AND RETRIEVED THE NEXT DAY SO THAT IT DOESN'T BECOME A COST PROHIBITIVE 
20:02:28 ISSUE FOR PEOPLE?
IS THAT SOMETHING THAT WAS FACTORED IN?

20:02:33 I SEE YOU'RE NODDING.
>> YES, WE'RE JUST KIND OF LOOKING AT EACH OTHER.

20:02:42 YES, SO AGAIN, KIND OF ALLUDING TO WHAT COURTNEY SAID EARLIER, WE WOULDN'T WANT THIS TYPE OF PROVISION OR 
20:02:48 REQUIREMENT TO BE A BARRIER FOR ANYBODY, SO WE WOULD CERTAINLY SUPPORT PEOPLE WITH HAVING THE PROPER SAFETY 
20:02:55 EQUIPMENT IN THEIR VEHICLE, IF IT'S THROUGH A STASH THAT WE HAVE AT THE CITY OR IT'S COMMUNITY DONATIONS, 
20:03:01 WE'VE ALREADY ACCEPTED COMMUNITY DONATIONS FOR SUCH MATERIALS, WE'VE EVEN PURCHASED THEM THROUGH GRANT 
20:03:09 FUNDING, SO IT'S MATERIALS WE DEFINITELY ATTEND TO SUPPORT WITH IF NEEDED.

20:03:13 >> Councilmember Jones: ALONG WITH THAT, YOU CAN MITIGATE THE CO2 IN PARTICULAR BY THE WAY YOU POSITION THE 
20:03:23 RVs AND WHERE THE GENERATOR EXHAUST IS, BUT THERE ARE ALSO ATTACHMENTS THAT CAN BE PUT ON TO THAT EXHAUST THAT 
20:03:28 COME OUT AND GO UP AND DIRECT ALL THE EMISSION OUTWARD RATHER THAN TO THE SIDE WHERE IT AFFECT ANOTHER VEHICLE.

20:03:36 THAT MIGHT BE SOMETHING, AGAIN, WE HAVE VOLUNTEERS OR COMMUNITY MEMBERS, YOU KNOW, EITHER AGREE TO FUND OR ACTUALLY 
20:03:44 MAKE, THEY'RE FAIRLY EASY TO MAKE.
AND THEN THE OTHER QUESTION WAS JUST TO CLARIFY, I UNDERSTAND NOT HAVING A 
20:03:51 REQUIREMENT FOR VEHICLE REGISTRATION, BUT DID YOU SAY LICENSING AND DID YOU MEAN LICENSE PLATE OR DID YOU MEAN 
20:03:59 DRIVER'S LICENSE?
>> DRIVER'S LICENSE.
>> Councilmember Jones: SO WE'RE NOT 
20:04:06 GOING TO REQUIRE DRIVER'S LICENSE FOR PEOPLE PARTICIPATING IN THE PROGRAM?
>> SO IF THEIR LICENSE IS EXPIRED, WE 
20:04:14 WOULD HELP THEM WORK TO RENEW IT.
BUT IT WOULDN'T BE A MATTER THAT THEY NEEDED -- I THINK IT'S MORE IF THEY 
20:04:23 HAD LIKE A LICENSE THAT WAS EXPIRED, WE WOULD HELP THEM WORK TO RENEW THAT BECAUSE THERE'S MANY REASONS WHY A 
20:04:28 LICENSE HAS EXPIRED, BUT IT WOULDN'T BE A REQUIREMENT FOR TO BE VALID FOR THEM TO ENTER.

20:04:33 >> Councilmember Jones: I WOULD GUESS IT TAKES FOREVER TO GET AN APPOINTMENT AT DMV.

20:04:41 BUT FOR OUR CITY ATTORNEY, DOES THAT CREATE ANY KIND OF LIABILITY ISSUE IF YOU ARE AWARE THAT SOMEBODY DOESN'T 
20:04:50 HAVE A LICENSE AND THEY ARE ALLOWED TO DRIVE OUT ON THE PUBLIC STREET AFTER THAT, OR IS THAT JUST KIND OF -- I 
20:04:55 MEAN I KNOW IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT MOST LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES ARE ACTIVELY ENFORCING AT THIS POINT.

20:05:06 SUSPENDED LICENSE, REVOKED LICENSE, BUT DO WE INCUR ANY LIABILITY BY ALLOWS A NONLICENSED DRIVER TO LEAVE THE 
20:05:09 PARKING LOT?
>> I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD.

20:05:14 IT'S CERTAINLY AN ISSUE THAT RAISED A RED FLAG WHEN I HEARD IT AS WELL, SO SOMETHING I THINK WE'LL HAVE TO WORK 
20:05:18 THROUGH.
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT'S IN THE ORDINANCE ITSELF, IS IT?

20:05:26 SO I THINK THAT'S AN IMPLEMENTATION ISSUE THAT WE'LL NEED TO WORK ON.
>> Councilmember Jones: OKAY.

20:05:33 AND THEN SINCE YOU'RE ANSWERING A QUESTION, I'LL BRING UP ONE MORE REGARDING POTENTIAL LIABILITY, AND I 
20:05:39 HATE TO EVEN ADDRESS THIS BUT, YOU KNOW, IT'S A VERY LITIGATION-HAPPY SOCIETY THAT WE LIVE IN.

20:05:48 ARE WE EXPOSING OURSELF TO ANYTHING BY CALLING IT A SAFE PARKING LOT?
>> BY THE NAME ITSELF?

20:05:53 >> Councilmember Jones: CORRECT.
>> JUST BAY CALLING IT SAFE?
>> Councilmember Jones: IF WE CALL IT 
20:06:03 SAFE, DOES THAT INFER WE ARE ENSURING THE SAFETY OF  EVERYONE THERE?


20:06:07 >> I WOULDN'T THINK SO.
I THINK WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO COME TO A LOCATION 
20:06:11 THAT HAS SOME SERVICES THAT ARE GOING TO HELP THEM OUT, BUT WE'RE NOT PROMPTING THAT THEY PERSONALLY ARE 
20:06:17 GOING TO BE SAFE THE ENTIRE TIME THEY'RE THERE.
>> Councilmember Jones: OKAY.

20:06:25 I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT IT JUST -- JUST BY THE MERE NAME OF IT DOESN'T INFER SOMETHING THAT PUTS US AT ANY 
20:06:32 TYPE OF RISK.
I MEAN, I HAVE LOOKED AT A LOT OF THE OTHER PROGRAMS THAT ARE GOING ON, IT 
20:06:41 DOESN'T REALLY SEEM TO BE AN ISSUE, EVEN WITH THE CRIMINAL ACTIVITY IN THE  EVENING, MOST OF THE SITES SEEM TO BE 
20:06:46 PRETTY WELL MAINTAIN AND AND PRETTY WELL ORGANIZED AND EVERYBODY IS CIVIL TO EACH  OTHER, AND I THINK FOR THE 
20:06:53 MOST PART, THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE ARE JUST HAPPY TO FIND A PLACE WHERE THEY'RE NOT -- THERE'S NOT A CON STABT 
20:07:01  A CONSTANT STREAM OF TRAFFIC.
THOSE ARE MY QUESTIONS FOR NOW.
THANK YOU.

20:07:10 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
AT THIS TILE, I'D LIKE TO TURN TO COUNCILMEMBER COX FOR  CLARIFYING 
20:07:14 QUESTIONS.
>> Councilmember Cox: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

20:07:24 I'M GOING TO START AT THE TOP AND JUST GO AT MY LIST OF QUESTIONS.
I APPRECIATE THE STAFF PUTTING 
20:07:33 TOGETHER THIS INFORMATION.
I WANTED TO FIND OUT A LITTLE BIT MORE ON THE SITE OPERATOR, THIS IS GOING TO 
20:07:40 BE THE ORGANIZATION'S SITE OPERATOR, NOT THE CITY OF FREMONT, IS THAT CORRECT?

20:07:53 >> THE ORDINANCE WOULD SET OUT ESSENTIALLY THAT EACH SITE MUST DESIGNATE A CONTACT PERSON OR SOMEONE 
20:08:00 WHO IS ON CALL FOR HANDLING ANY POTENTIAL CONCERNS OR ISSUES AT THE SITE SHOULD THEY ARISE.

20:08:07 THEY'D ALSO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR, AS LAURIE MENTIONED EARLIER, ESSENTIALLY PROVIDING A WELCOME FOR GUESTS EACH 
20:08:13 EVENING, CHECKING PEOPLE IN, MAKING SURE EVERYONE IS WHERE THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE, SO IN THE MODELS THAT 
20:08:17 WE LOOKED AT AND WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING IN THIS MODEL WOULD BE THAT THOSE SERVICES WOULD BE PROVIDED BY 
20:08:24 VOLUNTEERS FROM THE ORGANIZATION PROVIDING THE SAFE PARKING.
WHAT LAURIE ALSO MENTIONED IN HER 
20:08:30 PRESENTATION, THOUGH, WAS THAT WE ALSO DO ANTICIPATE THAT STAFF TIME FROM CITY STAFF WILL CONTINUE TO BE 
20:08:38 REQUIRED IN THE KIND OF OVERALL COORDINATION AND KIND OF LOGISTICS OF IMPLEMENTING THIS ENTIRE  PROGRAM, 
20:08:44 BOTH WITH REGARD TO IMPLEMENTING FACILITIES AT DIFFERENT SITES, COORDINATING BETWEEN DIFFERENT 
20:08:50 RELIGIOUS FACILITIES SHOULD THEY CHOOSE TO DO A ROTATIONAL PROGRAM, AND SO THAT KIND OF OVERHEAD ASPECT WOULD 
20:08:57 STILL BE SOMETHING THAT CITY STAFF WOULD BE PROVIDING.
>> Councilmember Cox: SO NATURALLY, IF 
20:09:04 YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT THIS TYPE OF PROGRAM, WHAT I WOULD PROBABLY EXPECT IS, I SEE, YOU KNOW, IN THE STAFF 
20:09:13 NOTES THAT WE WOULD HAVE ABOUT $340,000.
IS THAT ONLY FOR ONE YEAR FOR RUNNING 
20:09:17 THIS PROGRAM OR HOW MANY YEARS IS THIS PROGRAM?
BECAUSE I'M LOOKING AT, BEFORE I CAN 
20:09:25 UNDERSTAND AND MAKE A DECISION, I DON'T HAVE THE OTHER PIECES OF UNDERSTANDING IF YOU'RE RUNNING A PROGRAM, THE 
20:09:33 BUDGET, WHAT IS THE STAFF THAT'S GOING TO BE DEDICATED OR THE AMOUNT OF TIME, HOW IS THAT GOING TO INVOLVE WITH OUR 
20:09:45 FIRE, OUR POLICE, AND THEN ALSO, YOU KNOW, ANYTHING THAT IS USING OUR TAXPAYERS' MONEYS, HOW IS THIS GOING 
20:09:53 TO BE ADDRESSED AND MANAGED?
AND THAT'S THE PART I'M VERY CONCERNED ABOUT, OF THE MAGNITUDE THAT THIS 
20:10:02 COULD TAKE ON FOR ALL OF OUR CITY STAFF TO BE ABLE TO MANAGE THIS PART.
SO I DON'T SEE A PROPOSAL ABOUT THE 
20:10:12 FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF A SUGGESTED OR A ESTIMATED TYPE OF PROGRAM AND PLAN IN OPERATING THIS?

20:10:21 >> COUNCILMEMBER COX, I'M GOING TO TRY AND ADDRESS THAT QUESTION IF I COULD.
WE'VE HAD A NUMBER OF FROZEN POSITIONS 
20:10:31 WITHIN THE CITY, AND THE HUMAN SERVICES DEPARTMENT HAS RECENTLY RECEIVED AUTHORIZATION TO FILL A POSITION THAT 
20:10:37 HAS BEEN VACANT FOR A  WHILE, WHICH IS A MANAGEMENT ANALYST POSITION WITH THE INTENTION OF HAVING THAT PERSON HELP 
20:10:46 TO COORDINATE THE SAFE PARKING PROGRAM, AS WELL AS TAKE ON SOME OTHER MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES IN THE 
20:10:53 DEPARTMENT.
>> Councilmember Cox: SO THAT WOULD BE ONE FULL TIME PERSON TO BE ABLE TO 
20:10:56 MANAGE THAT PLUS THEIR OTHER RESPONSIBILITIES?
>> YES.

20:11:00 >> Councilmember Cox: INSIDE OF YOUR HUMAN SERVICES DEPARTMENT?
>> YES, THAT'S CORRECT.

20:11:08 >> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.
>> AND THE FUNDING THAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE, THE CARES ACT FUNDING IS 
20:11:16 GOOD FOR FIVE YEARS.
THOUGH WE'VE GOT IT LAST YEAR, SO THAT'S PROBABLY ABOUT 4 1/2 YEARS NOW 
20:11:23 ROLLING FORWARD.
SO THAT'S THE $340,000 THAT WE'VE SET ASIDE TO HELP LAUNCH THIS PROGRAM.

20:11:34 KO
>> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.
MY OTHER CONCERN, BESIDES THE 
20:11:43 RESOURCES, IS, IS THIS REQUIRING FREMONT POLICE AND FIRE TO HAVE TO HIRE ANYONE ELSE TO HELP ASSIST IN 
20:11:52 OPERATING THIS PLAN?
ESPECIALLY BETWEEN 10:00 P.M. TO 7:00 A.M., WHERE A LOT OF THINGS DO GET 
20:12:04 INTERESTING, SHALL WE  SAY, AND HOW WE OR HOW IS THE SITE OR THE CITY GOING TO BE ABLE TO MANAGE THAT PART WHEN 
20:12:12 THINGS GET A LITTLE MORE INTERESTING?
>> I WOULD RESPOND BY SAYING IN THE PROGRAMS THAT WE'VE TALKED TO, THE 
20:12:19 NUMBER OF TIMES THAT POLICE HAVE BEEN CALLED OUT HAVE BEEN REALLY MINIMAL.
THAT'S ACTUALLY TRUE WITH OUR HOUSING 
20:12:29 NAVIGATION CENTER AS WELL.
IN MOST INSTANCES, IF THERE'S NEED FOR SAFETY PERSONNEL, IT GENERALLY TENDS 
20:12:35 TO DO WITH SOME TYPE OF MEDICAL ISSUE THAT MAY ARISE DURING THE NIGHT WHEREAS STANCE MIGHT BE NEEDED.

20:12:42 BUT THERE REALLY HAS BEEN NO NEED FOR POLICE TO COME RELATED TO OTHER KINDS OF INCIDENCES.

20:12:53 >> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.
I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR HOW THE POLICE AND FIRE WOULD BE ADDRESSING THIS AND 
20:13:00 PARTNERING WITH THE MANAGEMENT ANALYST IN YOUR DEPARTMENT BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S GOT TO BE SOME SORT OF 
20:13:09 UNDERSTANDING BECAUSE I'M WORRIED AND I WILL SPEAK THIS FROM REPRESENTING IRVINGTON DISTRICT THAT WE HAD THREE 
20:13:19 SEXUAL ASSAULTS THAT OCCURRED IN THAT DISTRICT, WHICH IMPACTS ALL OF FREMONT AND I'M VERY  CONCERNED ABOUT THE 
20:13:30 COMMUNITY SAFETY AND KNOWING WHO IS COMING IN TO THESE HOST SITES, AND I'M VERY TROUBLED BY NOT HAVING A DRIVER'S 
20:13:37 LICENSE, NOT HAVING ANY TYPE OF INSURANCE.
THERE IS NO BACKGROUND -- I DIDN'T 
20:13:42 HEAR ANY BACK DOWN SCREENING, I HEARD SOMETHING IN THE WRITING OF THE ORDINANCE TALKING ABOUT PARTICIPANT 
20:13:46 SCREENING, AND I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS WHEN YOU SAY PARTICIPANT SCREENING.

20:13:57 ARE YOU -- THE PERSON THAT WROTE THIS BETWEEN COURTNEY AND LAURIE AND WHOEVER ELSE AND SUZANNE, WHAT IS THIS 
20:14:06 PARTICIPANT SCREENING ABOUT?
>> CAN I JUMP IN FOR A SECOND?
THIS IS WAYNE MORRIS HERE.

20:14:10 SO WE'RE MANAGING THIS RIGHT NOW IN THE CITY OF FREMONT, WE'RE MANAGING IT ALL OVER THE CITY.

20:14:18 SO -- AND WE'VE TALKED TO OUR FELLOW FIREFIGHTERS, OUR FIRE DEPARTMENT OR POLICE, SO WE'RE MANAGING IT.

20:14:26 IT WILL BE LESS MANAGEMENT IF WE CAN BRING IT TOGETHER AND HAVE DIFFERENT SITES, SO THAT'S WHAT I THINK SOME OF 
20:14:31 THAT PERSPECTIVE HAS TO BE LOOKED AT ALSO, IS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO BRING THESE 15 OR 20 CARS, AND IF WE CAN GET 
20:14:38 THREEL, FOUR OR FIVE OF THESE SITES, WE'VE GOT A HUNDRED VEHICLES THAT ARE AT FIVE SITES, WE DON'T HAVE THE 
20:14:45 HUNDRED VEHICLES ALL OVER THE CITY OF FREMONT, SO IT'S GOING TO BE MORE MANAGEABLE IF WE CAN GET, YOU KNOW -- 
20:14:50 IF -- WITH THIS ORDINANCE, IT'S GOING TO BE MORE MANAGEABLE THAN IT CURRENTLY IS.

20:14:58 >> Councilmember Cox: WELL, I STILL WOULD LIKE TO KNOW HOW MUCH TIME IT COULD TAKE.

20:15:05 I MEAN, IT'S PART OF RUNNING A PROGRAM THAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE MULTIPLYING FACTOR IF YOU HAVE MORE 
20:15:13 THAN ONE SITE, IT DOES TAKE AMOUNT OF TIME AND RESOURCES, AND I DON'T EVEN SEE ADDRESSED, I KNOW YOU TALK ABOUT 
20:15:19 TRASH AND TALK ABOUT RESTROOMS AND THOSE TYPE OF THINGS.
BUT IS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE 
20:15:31 EXPECTING THE SITE OPERATOR TO BE ABLE TO MANAGE THOSE PARTS INDEPENDENTLY AND NOT LOOK TO CITY OF FREMONT FOR 
20:15:35 ANY TYPE OF REIMBURSEMENT OR FUNDING?
>> I THINK COURTNEY CAN PROBABLY ANSWER THAT QUESTION.

20:15:41 >> RIGHT.
SO WE'RE HOPING TO SUPPORT SITES IN A NUMBER OF WAYS TO HELP THEM OR ASSIST 
20:15:47 THEM PROVIDE THOSE FACILITIES.
THE FIRST WOULD BE CREATING PARTNERSHIPS AMONG DIFFERENT 
20:15:50 ORGANIZATIONS.
WE'VE HEARD FROM MANY ORGANIZATIONS WHO ARE VERY INTERESTED IN SUPPORTING 
20:15:57 SAFE PARKING BUT MIGHT NOT HAVE A VERY BIG PARKING LOT OR MIGHT NOT HAVE A BIG ENOUGH CONGREGATION WHERE THEY CAN 
20:16:03 SUPPORT SAFE PARKING ON THEIR OWN, AND SO STEP ONE WOULD BE TO ENGAGE THOSE ORGANIZATIONS AND SEE IF THEY CAN MAKE 
20:16:09 IN-KIND DONATIONS TO THE OTHER FAITH ORGANIZATIONS WHO MAY BE ABLE TO HOST SAFE PARKING ON THEIR SITES AND, YOU 
20:16:14 KNOW, FUND A PORT-A-POTTY, A HAND WASHING STATION FOR A SAFE PARKING SITE.

20:16:22 THAT IS ALSO A COST THAT COULD BE COVERED BY THE $340,000 OF CARES ACT FUNDING THAT WE HAVE, JUST TO KIND OF 
20:16:33 PUT THE COST IN SCALE OR PERSPECTIVE FOR THE ONE HAND WASHING STATION AND -- OR SORRY, I THINK IT'S TWO 
20:16:37 PORT-A-POTTIES AND ONE HAND  WASHING STATION FOR ONE SITE, THE COST FOR A YEAR IS $13,000.

20:16:50 AND SO THAT COST, YOU KNOW, THINKING ABOUT IT OVER, YOU  KNOW, A FEW SITES, WOULD BE -- THERE WOULD STILL BE MONEY 
20:16:55 LEFT OVER IN MULTIPLE YEARS IN THE BUDGET TO SUPPORT THAT.
AND THEN THE LAST THING WHICH WAS 
20:17:00 TRASH FACILITIES, WE'VE EXPLORED THIS WITH OUR ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES DIVISION AND FOUND THAT WE CAN ADD 
20:17:06 THESE SITES TO THE CITY'S REPUBLIC SERVICES ACCOUNT AT NO ADDITIONAL CHARGE TO THE CITY.

20:17:13 AND SO THAT WOULD BE A SERVICE THAT WE COULD OFFER TO FACILITIES WHO MIGHT NEED IT FOR ESSENTIALLY NO ADDITIONAL 
20:17:18 COST.
YEAH.
>> Councilmember Cox: I WAS GOING TO 
20:17:27 ASK ALSO, I THINK WE ALSO -- WE'VE GOT TO LOOK AT THE AMOUNT OF CLEAN-UP THE LAST COUPLE YEARS THAT IS THROUGHOUT 
20:17:37 FREMONT WITH UNSHELTERED RESIDENTS, AND THAT HAS GONE UP EACH YEAR.
SO THERE'S GOING TO BE A PART WHERE 
20:17:46 SOME OF THE PARTICIPANTS THAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT NOT BEING ABLE TO UNDERSTAND THAT IT COULD GET VERY 
20:17:53 COSTLY, THAT THEY COULD BACK OUT AND SAY, I DIDN'T SIGN UP FOR THIS.
SO I'M CONCERNED ABOUT SOME THE 
20:18:03 OPERATING COST OF THE CLEANLINESS.
I SEE IT FROM MY OTHER SIDE OF LIFE HERE AND PROFESSIONAL WORK THAT WE 
20:18:09 DEAL WITH THAT TYPE OF REMEDIATION, BIOREMEDIAL  SERVICES AND CLEANING THAT TAKES A LOT OF MONEY, MORE THAN 
20:18:18 YOU ANTICIPATE, AND SO THAT'S ANOTHER PART OF THE PROGRAM THAT I DON'T THINK HAS BEEN ADDRESSED WITH EACH ONE OF 
20:18:26 THESE SITES, EVEN THOUGH YOU MAY SHARE WITH THE SITE OPERATOR AND ORGANIZATION, BUT WE NEED TO ALSO 
20:18:34 CONSIDER THAT PART AS WELL.
AND OPERATING THIS TYPE OF PROGRAM AND I -- YOU KNOW, I SEE WHERE THERE'S 
20:18:42 CERTAIN THINGS THAT YOU'RE HOLDING THE SITE OPERATORS RESPONSIBLE, BUT I THINK IT COULD BE A POINT THAT ARE YOU 
20:18:51 EXPECTING THEM TO SIGN A CONTRACT WITH THE CITY? TO HOST THIS TYPE OF SITE OR IS THIS A SITE JUST ON THEMSELVES?

20:18:58 I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THAT PART OF THE IMPLEMENTATION, BECAUSE I THINK IN SOME WAYS THE ORDINANCE MAY BE A 
20:19:05 LITTLE BIT PREMATURE UNTIL WE HAVE SOME OTHER THINGS IN PLACE THAT WE UNDERSTAND THE WHOLE OPERATION.

20:19:11 I KNOW YOU'RE DOING A THREE PRONG AND YOU'RE STARTING WITH THE FIRST PRONG, BUT I THINK THERE'S SOME PARTS MISSING 
20:19:17 IN ORDER TO HELP ME MAKE A GOOD DECISION HERE.
ANOTHER PART THAT I NOTICED WAS THAT 
20:19:24 FOR FIRE SAFETY, THERE WASN'T A MENTION OF ANY -- IF YOU'RE IN A CAR, THERE'S NO MENTION OF -- I KNOW YOU KIND OF 
20:19:32 REFER TO IT AS A WARMING APPARATUS OR APPLIANCE, BUT I'M ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT ANY TYPE OF CAR CIGARETTE 
20:19:40 LIGHTERS OR CANDLES OR THINGS THAT COULD CATCH ON FIRE AS WELL.
IF THEY'RE IN THE PARKING LOT.

20:19:47 THAT WAS SOMETHING I WAS WONDERING ABOUT BECAUSE THAT WASN'T ADDRESSED IN THE ORDINANCE AS WELL.

20:19:59 >> SO IF I COULD JUST GO BACK AND ADDRESS KIND OF BOTH OF YOUR POINTS, SO I THINK YES, IF SITES ARE RECEIVING 
20:20:05 FUNDING FROM THE CITY TO HAVE SERVICES PROVIDED, THEN THEY CERTAINLY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO SIGN AN MOU WITH US, SO WE 
20:20:10 BOTH UNDERSTOOD THE TERMS OF THOSE AGREEMENTS.
BUT THOSE WOULD NEED TO BE SIGNED OP A 
20:20:15 SITE BY SITE BASIS SO IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN PROVIDE AT THE SAME TIME AS THE ORDINANCE.

20:20:22 IT WOULD BE SOMETHING WE WOULD CREATE WITH EACH SITE LATER DOWN THE ROAD AS WE GAINED AN UNDERSTANDING FOR WHAT 
20:20:26 SERVICES THEY REQUIRED FROM THE CITY, BECAUSE ONE THING WE'VE COME TO UNDERSTAND FROM WORKING WITH OUR 
20:20:33 FAITH-BASED GROUPS IS THAT DIFFERENT GROUPS ARE GOING TO HAVE DIFFERENT NEEDS, AND DIFFERENT SITES MAY END UP 
20:20:38 NEEDING DIFFERENT SERVICES AND DIFFERENT ASSISTANCE FROM THE CITY AND OTHER FACILITIES.

20:20:46 SO WE CERTAINLY WOULD ANTICIPATE SIGNING AN MOU WITH ORGANIZATIONS WE'RE ASSISTING WITH FUNDS.

20:20:56 TO THE SECOND COMMENT ABOUT THE KIND OF CANDLES AND YOU KNOW, KIND OF GENERAL FIRE UNSAFE ACTIVITY, THAT'S NOT 
20:21:01 SOMETHING WE INTEND TO BE ALLOWED.
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT CANDLES ARE EXPLICITLY MENTIONED IN THE ORDINANCE, 
20:21:06 BUT I WOULD CERTAINLY ANTICIPATE THAT THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE COVERED UNDER THE GENERAL PROVISION 
20:21:15 ABOUT NO OUTDOOR COOKING, FIRES, NO LIT FIRE OF ANY TYPE WOULD BE ALLOWED AND THAT WOULD CERTAINLY INCLUDE CANDLES 
20:21:20 IN PEOPLE'S VEHICLES.
>> Councilmember Cox: AND CIGARETTE LIGHTERS TOO.

20:21:27 THAT'S SOMETHING YOU MAY HAVE TO ADD IN JUST SO IT'S PRESENT IN THAT WORDING THERE, BECAUSE THERE WOULD BE 
20:21:34 LOOPHOLES.
AND UNDERSTANDING THAT.
ANOTHER PART THAT I'M REALLY TROUBLED 
20:21:41 ALSO IS THAT YOU HAVE THE DRIVER'S LICENSE, WHEN WE GET CARS AND THINGS, AND I KNOW THAT EVERYTHING COULD BE 
20:21:48 GOING THROUGH SOME HARD TIMES, BUT I STILL FEEL THAT WE SHOULD REALLY RE-THINK ABOUT THE WHOLE DRIVER'S 
20:21:56 LICENSE SCENARIO AND HAVING CAR INSURANCE, THOSE TYPE OF THINGS ARE PRETTY STANDARD WHEN YOU OPERATE YOUR 
20:22:05 CAR AND EVEN IF YOU'RE IN THAT SITE, IF YOU HAVE TO GO OUT TO GET GAS OR SOMETHING OR DRIVING YOUR CAR, I 
20:22:11 WOULDN'T WANT THAT IN THE SITE AND THE CITY OF FREMONT COULD GET SUED BECAUSE OF AN ACCIDENT THAT COULD OCCUR.

20:22:25 SO I WOULD DEFINITELY LIKE TO GET SOME MORE INSTRUCTION  LEGALLY FROM OUR ATTORNEY BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S 
20:22:32 CONTRADICTION WHEN WE LOOK AT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THEY REQUIRE US TO TAKE DRIVER'S LICENSE AND HAVE CERTAIN 
20:22:37 THINGS MAINTAINED, WE'VE STILL GOT TO COMPLY WITH IT EVEN IF THEY'RE ON SITE AND THEY MAY DRIVE THE CAR MINIMALLY, 
20:22:46 WE STILL, AS DRIVERS OF A CAR, HAVE GOT TO HAVE THESE TYPE OF THINGS, OTHERWISE IT'S NOT A LEGAL SETUP OR 
20:22:54 SITE.
SO I REALLY WOULD LIKE TO EMPHASIZE A PART OF THAT IN ADDITION TO SOME OF 
20:23:01 THE OTHER DISCUSSIONS.
AND WHAT WAS MY OTHER QUESTION?
>> SO I DO JUST WANT TO INTERJECT AND 
20:23:07 MAKE SURE SO THAT WE'RE CLEAR, THERE IS NO DISCUSSION IN THE ORDINANCE AT ALL ABOUT SCREENING PROCEDURES, INCLUDING 
20:23:13 THINGS LIKE DRIVER'S LICENSE REGISTRATION.
THAT'S A BEST PRACTICE WE'VE TAKEN 
20:23:19 FROM A LOOK AT OTHER PROGRAMS SO THAT'S WHY IT'S NOT IN THERE, BUT WHEN YOU'RE YOU BE VOTING ON ADOPTING THE 
20:23:28 ORDINANCE TONIGHT, THOSE SPECIFIC CRITERIA ARE NOT IN THERE, SO IT'S SOMETHING WE COULD REVISIT AT A LATER 
20:23:36 DATE SHOULD THE ORDINANCE BE ADOPTED.
WE UNDERSTOOD IT WAS A COMPLEX ISSUE, EVEN WITH A LOT OF  SITE-SPECIFIC 
20:23:42 CONSIDERATIONS, WHO IS WELCOME TO PARTICIPATE, WE WANTED TO WITHHOLD THAT FOR A MORE SITE BY SITE 
20:23:45 DISCUSSION, SO IT IS, AGAIN, NOT A REQUIREMENT THAT'S IN THE ORDINANCE BEFORE YOU TONIGHT.

20:23:53 >> City Manager Danaj: ALSO IF I COULD JUST ADD TOO, I'D ENCOURAGE COUNCIL TO THINK OF THIS ORDINANCE AS LARGELY AN 
20:24:00 IMPLEMENTATION MECHANISM OR FRAMEWORK.
IT'S NOT THE ACTUAL PROGRAM THAT WOULD BE ROLLED OUT.

20:24:06 SO THIS IS PROVIDING A FRAMEWORK BY WHICH WE CAN OPERATE AND DEVELOP PROGRAMS WITHIN, MIGHT BE AN EASIER 
20:24:11 WAY OF VIEWING IT TONIGHT.
>> Councilmember Cox: I HEAR THAT, BUT I'M SORRY, I REALLY DISAGREE ON THAT.

20:24:21 IF WE DON'T TAKE RESPONSIBILITY OF SETTING WHAT IS REQUIRED BY THE HIGHER LAWS, ESPECIALLY WHEN ALL OF RUSS -- 
20:24:29 WE'RE LUCKY TO HAVE OUR OWN CARS, DRIVER'S LICENSE AND CAR INSURANCE, I WOULD EXPECT THE SAME IF ANYONE WAS ON 
20:24:37 THOSE TYPE OF SITES, AND THAT WE NORMALLY WOULD OPERATE A PROGRAM THAT DOES NOT FOLLOW THE LAW, THE STATE OF 
20:24:44 CALIFORNIA.
AND I CAN'T AGREE ON SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING THAT IS NOT 
20:24:51 VALID AND LEGAL, IT MAKES PART OF IT INTO NOT BEING A LEGAL TYPE OF ORDINANCE.

20:24:59 AND SO I'M SORRY, I CAN'T BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THIS TYPE OF PROGRAM, BECAUSE I'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE ANYBODY PARKING 
20:25:05 -- BECAUSE I GET COMPLAINTS AND I KNOW ALL MY OTHER FELLOW CITY COUNCILMEMBERS DO, AND YOU LOOK OUT 
20:25:12 AND EVEN AS I WALK OUT OF CHURCH OR I GO DOWN THE STREETS IN THE PARK, THERE ARE VEHICLES OUT THERE, THEY ARE 
20:25:25 PARKING RIGHT NOW.
I DON'T KNOW WHO'S IN THERE, AND I CAN'T HAVE ANYONE IN MY  BELOVED 
20:25:28 COMMUNITY OF FREMONT BE IN JEOPARDY OF HAVING SOMETHING HAPPEN.
BECAUSE ALL IT TAKES IS ONE.

20:25:33 NO ONE WOULD EVER BELIEVE WE HAD A SEXUAL ASSAULT HERE IN IRVINGTON AT 11:00 IN THE MORNING.

20:25:40 WHY WOULD I BELIEVE THAT SOMETHING ELSE COULD HAPPEN LIKE THIS?
AND OUR BELOVED FREMONT?

20:25:45 I KNOW YOU GUYS ARE WORKING HARD BUT I THINK WE'VE GOT TO ADD SOME OTHER PROCESS IN THERE TO PROTECT OUR 
20:25:49 COMMUNITY.
IT COMMUNITY SAFETY WHEN YOU OPERATE THESE TYPE OF PROGRAMS, AND WE ALSO 
20:25:54 ARE LIABLE, BECAUSE IT'S ALL UNDER ORDINANCE.
IT GOES BACK TO THE CITY OF FREMONT.

20:26:01 AND I'M SORRY, I JUST CANNOT, WITHOUT SOME OF THESE OTHER PROVISIONS IN HERE, I'M SORRY, I WOULD NOT BE ABE 
20:26:09  ABLE TO SUPPORT THAT TONIGHT.
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY.
THANK YOU.

20:26:18 NEXT FOR COUNCILMEMBER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS AT THIS POINT, VICE MAYOR YANG SHAO.

20:26:24 >> Vice Mayor Shao: THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR.
I WOULD ONLY LIMIT MY TIME TO 
20:26:31 QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME, BECAUSE I KNOW THAT MANY PEOPLE IN THE AUDIENCE WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK.

20:26:47 SO I WANT TO KNOW FIRST OF ALL, THE TRANSPARENCY OF THIS APPLICATION AND INSPECTION, BECAUSE THAT IS VERY 
20:26:57 IMPORTANT FOR THE COMMUNITY MEMBERS TO KNOW, SO WOULD THE APPLICATION AND THE INSPECTION RESULT BECOME PUBLIC RECORD 
20:27:02  AFTERWARDS, AFTER THE APPLICATION IS APPROVED?
>> SO ALL PERMITS THAT ARE SUBMITTED 
20:27:09 TO THE CITY'S COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT THAT AREN'T BUILDING PERMITS ARE MORE OF THE ENTITLEMENT 
20:27:18 KIND OF PERMITS ARE PUBLIC RECORD, SO THEY'RE VIEWABLE TO THE PUBLIC NOT ONLY AFTER THEY'RE APPROVED, THEY HAVE 
20:27:25 INFORMATION AN APPLICATION HAS BEEN SUBMITTED, UNDER REVIEW, AND RESULTS OF THAT REVIEW, CONSISTENTLY 
20:27:28 THROUGHOUT THE DEVELOPMENT REVIEW PROCESS.
SO THE SHORT ANSWER IS YES, THE PUBLIC 
20:27:33 WILL HAVE KNOWLEDGE OF IT EVERY STEP OF THE WAY.
>> Vice Mayor Shao: GREAT.

20:27:46 SECONDLY, RIGHT NOW WE DO HAVE CHURCH OPERATING HOT MEAL SERVICES MONDAY, WEDNESDAY AND FRIDAY OUT OF IRVINGTON 
20:27:56  PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH AND RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET FROM HORNER JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL.

20:28:09 SO MY QUESTION IS, DO WE HAVE ANY RECORD AS TO THE IMPACT OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD SAFETY OR SCHOOL SAFETY 
20:28:17 BASED ON THEIR DECADES OF SERVICE RECORD?
I KNOW THEY PROVIDE A LOT OF SERVICE 
20:28:25 TO UNSHELTERED PEOPLE, AND I PERSONALLY EVEN BECAME A VOLUNTEER ABOUT 10 YEARS AGO IN THEIR BREAKFAST PROGRAM, SO MY 
20:28:36 QUESTION IS IS THERE ANY RECORD TO EITHER WARN THE COMMUNITY OR ENSURE THE COMMUNITY ONE WAY OR THE OTHER 
20:28:44 THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE ANY POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE NEIGHBORING COMMUNITY AND THE SCHOOL?

20:28:56 >> WHAT I CAN SHARE BASED ON OUR EXPERIENCE RUNNING THE CLEAN START HYGIENE PROGRAM ALSO IS AT IRVINGTON 
20:29:02 DURING THE BREAKFAST TIME AS WELL AS CENTERVILLE PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH AND NILES DISCOVERY CHURCH, WE'VE BEEN 
20:29:11 RUNNING THAT PROGRAM FOR TWO YEARS NOW AND HAVE NOT HAD TO CALL FOR MEDICAL OR LAW ENFORCEMENT SUPPORT, NOR HAVE 
20:29:18 ANY OTHER PARTICIPANTS CALLED FOR SUPPORT DURING OUR PROGRAM HOURS.
SO THAT'S THE MOST CURRENT UP TO DATE 
20:29:20 INFORMATION I COULD PROVIDE TO THAT QUESTION.
>> Vice Mayor Shao: THANK YOU.

20:29:29 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
AT THIS TIME, COUNCILMEMBER  KENG.
>> Councilmember Keng: THANK YOU, 
20:29:36 MADAME MAYOR.
SO I DO APPRECIATE THE STAFF VERY MUCH FOR PROVIDING ALL THAT INFORMATION, 
20:29:45 AND THE RESEARCH THAT YOU'VE DONE.
I DO HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS FIRST, CAN YOU CLARIFY HOW PEOPLE CAN 
20:29:57 REGISTER FOR THE PROGRAM?
>> I'M SORRY, THE SITE THAT'S INTERESTED IN HOSTING OR --

20:30:04 >> Councilmember Keng: ACTUALLY NO, SORRY, THE PEOPLE WHO ARE INTERESTED TO PARK, SLEEP THERE AT NIGHT.

20:30:14 >> SO WE HAVEN'T SET UP THE PROGRAM DESIGN AND PROCESS YET, BUT SIMILAR TO OTHER PROGRAMS WE'VE OPERATED, IT 
20:30:19 WOULD START ON A REFERRAL BASIS WITH OUR SERVICE PROVIDER PARTNERS, AND WE COULD EXPAND FROM THERE BY  DOING 
20:30:23 OUTREACH INTO THE COMMUNITY.
>> Councilmember Keng: OKAY, THANK YOU.

20:30:31 AND THEN I KNOW THAT LAST YEAR WE DIDN'T HAVE A COUNT OF OUR HOMELESS POPULATION BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC.

20:30:42 FROM YOUR INTERACTION WITH THE COMMUNITY AND THE TEAM, DO YOU FEEL, YOU KNOW, THERE'S AN INCREASE OF THE 
20:30:56 NUMBER OF OUR HOMELESS FOLKS?
>> THERE'S AN INCREASE, DEFINITELY MORE VISIBILITY IN THE COMMUNITY, 
20:31:01 THAT'S TRUE OF THE BAY AREA IN GENERAL.
WE ARE AS COURTNEY SAID EARLIER ON -- 
20:31:09  WE ARE GOING TO DO A THREE-DAY OUTREACH THROUGHOUT THE CITY TO AREAS WHERE THERE'S VEHICLES TO GET A BETTER 
20:31:17 SENSE OF NUMBERS AND DEMOGRAPHICS AND INFORMATION, WE'LL PRESENT AT A LATER DATE.

20:31:29 >> Councilmember Keng: NEXT QUESTION IS WITH THE BUDGETING, RIGHT NOW WE HAVE ABOUT $340,000 SET ASIDE FOR THIS 
20:31:37 PROGRAM.
HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK IS THE ESTIMATED COST FOR THE CITY FOR ONE SITE HOSTING 
20:31:45 20 CARS FOR A MONTH?
BECAUSE WE COULD HAVE POTENTIALLY SEVERAL SITE HOSTING AT A TIME.

20:31:53 >> THAT'S CORRECT.
SO AS I MENTIONED, THE  EARLIER -- THE NEEDS OF THE SITES ARE GOING TO BE 
20:32:00 DIFFERENT, AND SO THE KIND OF LARGEST COST WE'RE ANTICIPATING IS FOR SITES THAT MAY REQUIRE FACILITIES -- 
20:32:07 TEMPORARY FACILITIES TO BE ESTABLISHED ON THE SITE IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE SAFE PARKING PROGRAM, SO THAT WOULD BE 
20:32:12 THE TEMPORARY PORT PA POTTIES AND HAND WASHING STAISHES THAT WOULD BE PROVIDED ON THE SITE.

20:32:21 THOSE SERVICES ARE $13,000 PER YEAR OF SERVICE, AND SO THAT WOULD BE KIND OF THE LARGEST  PER-SITE EXPENSE THAT WE 
20:32:31 WOULD BACK OF THE ENVELOPE MATH, A LITTLE MORE THAN $1,000 A MONTH, AND THEN OTHER MISCELLANEOUS SERVICES WE 
20:32:36 MENTIONED KIND OF PROVIDING FIRE EXTINGUISHERS, CARBON MONOXIDE DETECTORS AND KIND OF SMALLER EXPENSES 
20:32:44 LIKE THAT.
AND SO ON A MONTH BY MONTH BASIS, YOU KNOW, PER SITE, WE'RE LOOKING AT 
20:32:51 EXPENSES THAT ARE MUCH MORE IN THE LIKE $1,000 TO $5,000 RANGE THAN ANYTHING BIGGER THAN THAT.

20:32:57 SO THE FUNDING WE HAVE RIGHT  NOW, WE DO FEEL IS SUFFICIENT TO START UP THE PROGRAM AND TO OFFER INITIAL HOST 
20:33:05 SITES SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF ASSISTANCE WITH PROVIDING THOSE FACILITIES AT LEAST TO GET STARTED AT WHICH POINT, 
20:33:12 YOU KNOW, WE WOULD LOOK FOR EITHER ADDITIONAL FUNDING OR SUPPORT FROM OTHER RELIGIOUS FACILITIES WHO WE NO 
20:33:17  WE KNOW ARE INTERESTED IN PROVIDING SOME FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE.
>> Councilmember Keng: SO THEN ON THE 
20:33:25 LIABILITY INSURANCE PART, ARE THEY PROVIDING THAT -- ARE THEY PURCHASING THAT OR IS THE CITY GOING TO PAY FOR 
20:33:29 THAT?
>> THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT THE CITY WOULD PROVIDE.

20:33:36 IN OUR CONVERSATION WITH RISK MANAGEMENT, WE'VE DETERMINED THAT IT WOULD BE OF NEGLIGIBLE COST TO THE 
20:33:43 CITY TO SUPPORT THOSE PROGRAM WITH LIABILITY INSURANCE COVERAGE.
>> Councilmember Keng: OKAY, GOT IT.

20:33:50 MY LAST QUESTION, I WONDER IF STAFF HAD THE OPPORTUNITY YET TO REACH OUT TO THE COMMUNITY OR COMMUNITY MEMBERS 
20:33:55 REGARDING THE PROGRAM.
I KNOW THAT MANY RESIDENTS HAVE REACHED OUT WITH DIFFERENT QUESTIONS 
20:34:04 SUCH AS THE QUESTIONS THAT WE HAVE TONIGHT, AND I THINK IT WILL BE VERY HELPFUL TO HAVE LIKE A Q & A WORKSHOP 
20:34:14 SO THAT WE CAN HAVE THE COMMUNITY SUPPORT FOR THIS MUCH NEEDED PROGRAM.
>> I THINK THAT'S A GREAT SUGGESTION.

20:34:19 I THINK AS THE CITY MANAGER SAID, THIS IS REALLY THE FOUNDATION FOR BUILDING A MUCH LARGER PROGRAM OFF OF THESE 
20:34:24 BUILDING BLOCKS, AND SO THAT WILL LOOK LIKE CONTINUED  OUTREACH TO THE COMMUNITY AND CONTINUED OUTREACH TO 
20:34:30  FAITH-BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND OTHER ORGANIZATIONS WHO MAY BE INTERESTED IN SUPPORTING THIS PROGRAM AND SUPPORTING 
20:34:35 UNHOUSED PEOPLE LIVING IN VEHICLES.
>> Councilmember Keng: OKAY.
ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU.

20:34:46 >> Mayor Mei: NEXT IS COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN.
>> Councilmember Kassan: YEAH, I JUST 
20:34:53 WANTED TO CLARIFY SOMETHING BECAUSE IT'S -- THE WAY WE'RE DISCUSSING THIS TONIGHT, IT SOUNDS LIKE WE'RE KIND OF 
20:35:00 CONFLATING TWO THINGS A LITTLE BIT AND THIS HAS SORT OF BEEN ALLUDED TO BUT I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE IT'S SUPER 
20:35:06 CLEAR.
TONIGHT ALL WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ADOPTING IS A ZONING ORDINANCE, WHICH 
20:35:15 JUST CREATES A NEW TYPE OF USE THAT IS ALLOWED TO HAPPEN IN CERTAIN PARTS OF THE CITY.

20:35:22 WE'RE NOT CREATING ANY PROGRAM TONIGHT, WE'RE NOT COMMITTING TO PAY FOR ANYTHING TONIGHT.

20:35:31 ALL WE'RE DOING TONIGHT IS TALKING ABOUT ADOPTING A ZONING ORDINANCE WHICH SIMPLY GIVES THE RIGHT TO 
20:35:40 PRIVATE PROPERTY OWNERS TO HOST THESE USES SUBJECT TO THE CONDITIONS OF THE DETAILS IN THE ZONING ORDINANCE.

20:35:47 IS THAT CORRECT?
>> YES, THAT'S CORRECT.
THE ACTION BEFORE COUNCIL TONIGHT IS 
20:35:54 TO ADOPT -- OR TO INTRODUCE AND THEN ADOPT AN ORDINANCE THAT WOULD AMEND THE ZONING TO ALLOW SAFE PARKING AND 
20:36:00 CREATE PERFORMANCE STANDARDS USES THAT WOULD APPLY TO HAVE SAFE PARKING WOULD NEED TO FOLLOW, YES, IT IS A ZONING 
20:36:06 TEXT AMENDMENT, IT IS NOT A MOTION FOR ANY TYPE OF FUNDING OR PROGRAM OR ASSISTANCE.

20:36:12 >> Councilmember Kassan: RIGHT.
SO THAT KIND OF MEANS THAT THIS WHOLE ISSUE OF POTENTIAL LIABILITY IS KIND 
20:36:20 OF A NON-ISSUE BECAUSE BY CREATING A ZONING DESIGNATION, WE'RE NOT CREATING LIABILITY FOR THE CITY.

20:36:26 IF THERE WAS ANY LIABILITY, THE LIABILITY WOULD BE ON THE PROPERTY OWNER AND THE OPERATOR OF THE SITE.

20:36:33 OF COURSE IF WE DO END UP PROVIDING PROGRAMS OR THERE COULD BE POTENTIAL LIABILITY, BUT IN TERMS OF WHAT WE'RE 
20:36:40 ADOPTING TONIGHT, THERE'S NO WAY A ZONING ORDINANCE CREATING A NEW DESIGNATION IS GOING TO CREATE NEW 
20:36:43 LIABILITY FOR THE CITY.
IS THAT CORRECT?
>> CORRECT.

20:36:49 SO THE ORDINANCE THAT WE'RE ADOPTING TONIGHT WOULD ALLOW PRIVATE PROPERTY OWNERS TO DO THIS WITHOUT ANY CITY 
20:36:55 ASSISTANCE SHOULD THEY CHOOSE.
THE OVERWHELMING FEEDBACK WE'VE RECEIVED IS THAT ?ORD FOR THIS TO MOVE 
20:37:00 FORWARD, BECAUSE OF COVID AND THE PRECARIOUS FINANCIAL SITUATIONS THAT SOME ORGANIZATIONS ARE IN, WE NEED TO 
20:37:07 PROVIDE SUPPORT IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE IT GETS OFF THE GROUND, BUT THAT IS CORRECT, THAT PASSING THIS ORDINANCE 
20:37:12 IN AND OF ITSELF IS NOT THE CITY ASSISTING ANYONE WITH ANY OF THESE PROGRAMS.

20:37:15 >> Councilmember Kassan: OKAY.
AND I SAW THE CITY ATTORNEY NODDING HER HEAD.

20:37:21 IF YOU COULD JUST LIKE VERBALLY ANSWER THAT JUST SO PEOPLE CAN MAYBE HAVE THEIR MIND PUT AT EASE A LITTLE BIT 
20:37:31 ABOUT LIABILITY?
>> YES, MY UNDERSTANDING IS, AS YOU SAY, THIS ORDINANCE WOULD AUTHORIZE 
20:37:38 PRIVATE PROPERTY  OWNERS TO ALLOW THIS TYPE OF PARKING ON THEIR FACILITY.
TO THE EXTENT THAT THE CITY MIGHT GET 
20:37:45 INVOLVED WITH PROGRAMS OR WITH PROVIDING INSURANCE OR ANYTHING ELSE, THAT'S DOWN THE ROAD, AND WE COULD BE 
20:37:51 SUBJECT TO SOME LIABILITY IF THAT WERE TO HAPPEN, BUT AT THIS POINT IN TIME, JUST THE ADOPTION OF THE ORDINANCE 
20:37:54 ITSELF WOULD NOT CREATE LIABILITY FOR THE CITY.
>> Councilmember Kassan: THANK YOU.

20:38:00 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
CLARIFYING QUESTIONS, COUNCILMEMBER JONES.

20:38:09 
>> Councilmember Jones: ACTUALLY I WAS GOING TO MAKE THE SAME CLARIFICATION 
20:38:14 THAT COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN JUST DID REGARDING THE ZONING, BUT AGAIN, FOR  EVERYBODY'S BENEFIT, WANT TO MAKE SURE 
20:38:23 THAT WE'RE CHANGING THE ZONING, THIS DOES NOT GET ANYBODY -- EVEN THOUGH WE  CHANGED THE ZONING AND WE ALLOW SITES 
20:38:29 TO DO THIS, THEY STILL CAN'T DO IT WITHOUT GOING THROUGH A PERMIT PROCESS OF SOME SORT WITH THE CITY ON DOWN THE 
20:38:34 ROAD, RIGHT?
>> YES, THAT IS CORRECT.
IN ORDER TO DO SAFE PARKING ON THEIR 
20:38:40 SITES, PRIVATE SITES WOULD STILL NEED TO APPLY FOR THE SAFE PARKING HOST SITE PERMIT, GO THROUGH A CITY REVIEW 
20:38:53 AND MAKE SURE THEY MEET ALL OF THE PERFORMANCE STANDARDS,  UNDERGO --
>> Councilmember Jones: SO WE WOULD, 
20:38:59 IN THE FUTURE, BE CREATING AN ORDINANCE THAT WOULD OUTLINE ALL THE PARAMETERS OF THOSE TYPES OF PROGRAMS.

20:39:03 IS THAT CORRECT?
>> NO, SO --
>> Councilmember Jones: NO?

20:39:09 >> SO THE ORDINANCE IS THE  ZONING PERMISSION THAT WE WOULD NEED IN ORDER TO CREATE SUCH A PROGRAM.

20:39:16 BUT THE PROGRAM DETAILS THEMSELVES ARE NOT SOMETHING USUALLY LEGISLATED IN THE ZONING ORDINANCE.

20:39:21 IT WOULD TYPICALLY BE SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE HANDLED EITHER ADMINISTRATIVELY SHOULD COUNCIL DIRECT 
20:39:27 US TO DO THAT, OR THROUGH SOME OTHER NON-ZONING MEANS.
BUT ZONING IS REALLY TO SET THE 
20:39:33 STANDARDS THAT ARE APPLICABLE TO THE USE, AND THE DETAILS OF, YOU KNOW, HUMAN SERVICES PROGRAMS, YOU KNOW, 
20:39:38 THAT WE RUN ARE NOT TYPICALLY PUT IN THE ZONING ORDINANCE.
>> Councilmember Jones: OKAY.

20:39:49 SO I'M SORRY, I MISSPOKE, NOT AN ORDINANCE BUT THE PERMIT  PROCESS, WHO IS GOING TO BE INVOLVED, I'LL JUST PUT 
20:39:58 IT OUT THERE, IS THE COUNCIL GL GOING TO BE INVOLVED IN THAT PROCESS AS FAR AS WHAT THE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE, WHAT 
20:40:03 THE SCREENING PROCESS IS LIKE, ALL OF THOSE KINDS OF THINGS?
IS THAT SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO COME 
20:40:10 BACK TO US FOR A REVIEW BEFORE THE PERMIT PROCESS ITSELF IS DEVELOPED?
>> SO THE ORDINANCE ESTABLISHES THE 
20:40:16 PERMIT PROCESS, WHICH AS IT'S WRITTEN IN THE ORDINANCE, IS A MINISTERIAL PROCESS, WHICH MEANS IT'S A 
20:40:19 STAFF-LEVEL REVIEW.
SO IT WOULD BE STAFF FROM THE COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT  DEPARTMENT, 
20:40:27 HUMAN SERVICES DEPARTMENT, POLICE DEPARTMENT, FIRE DEPARTMENT, AND OTHER RELEVANT DEPARTMENTS REVIEWING EACH OF 
20:40:33 THE PERMITS FOR COMPLIANCE WITH THE STANDARDS IN THE ORDINANCE, AND COMPLIANCE WITH BEST PRACTICES IN 
20:40:38 THEIR OWN RESPECTIVE INDUSTRIES TO ENSURE THAT THE PERMITS ARE ABLE TO BE ISSUED FOR EACH SITE.

20:40:44 SO NO, THE PERMITS WOULD NOT RETURN TO COUNCIL EACH TIME THAT AN ORGANIZATION WISHED TO HAVE A SAFE PARKING HOST 
20:40:48 SITE.
COUNCIL'S AUTHORITY WOULD BE TO SET THE STANDARDS TONIGHT THROUGH THE 
20:40:56 ADOPTION OF THE ORDINANCE, WHICH WOULD THEN FURTHER BE REVIEWED BY STAFF FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL SITE.

20:41:05 >> I CERTAINLY DON'T WA TO DO EVERY INDIVIDUAL SITE WITH THE PERMIT PROCESS, I THOUGHT THREAT BE SOME TYPE 
20:41:12 OF POLICY THAT WE DEVELOPED.
SO FOR OUR CITY ATTORNEY TO THE POINT THAT COUNCILMEMBER COX BROUGHT UP WITH 
20:41:21 NOTHING IN THE ORDINANCE OR IN THE ZONING CHANGE THAT REQUIRES A SCREENING PROCESS WITH THE PROVISION 
20:41:31 THAT WE'RE ALLOWING PEOPLE TO VIOLATE STATE LAW BY DRIVING PROPERTIES OFF THE -- IT SOMETHING WE HOST OR IT 
20:41:38 PRIVATELY HOSTED, ARE THOSE THINGS THAT SHOULD BE CONTAINED IN TONIGHT'S DISCUSSION, OR ORDINANCE, OR IS THAT 
20:41:44 SOMETHING WE CAN CHANGE ON DOWN THE ROAD, BEFORE ANY OF THIS ACTUALLY PHYSICALLY TAKES EFFECT?

20:41:48 >> RIGHT.
AS COURTNEY HAS EXPLAINED, THE ORDINANCE TONIGHT IS SIMPLY TO LAY OUT 
20:41:52 THE PARAMETERS FOR THE ISSUANCE OF THE HOST SITE PERMITS AND WHAT IS REQUIRED FOR THAT.

20:42:02 THE PROGRAM ITSELF HAS NOT BEEN ESTABLISHED AND NAILED DOWN, SO THOSE ISSUES THAT YOU'VE JUST RAISED ARE 
20:42:08 ISSUES THAT WILL BE RAISED DOWN THE LINE AS WE PUT THE PROGRAM TOGETHER AND GET THE DETAILS IN SHAPE.

20:42:13 >> Councilmember Jones: AND THAT PROGRAM WILL COME BACK TO COUNCIL FOR COMMENT OR REVIEW OR IS THAT GOING TO 
20:42:19 BE MINISTERIAL?
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, THAT'S KIND OF UP TO THE CITY MANAGER AND PROBABLY HUMAN 
20:42:23 SERVICES  DIRECTOR.
IT COULD COME BACK TO THE COUNCIL IF COUNCIL WANTS TO.

20:42:32 OBVIOUSLY NOT SOMETHING COUNCIL WILL BE INVOLVED IN, AND YOU KNOW, I IMAGINE THE WHOLE PROGRAM COULD COME BACK IF 
20:42:38 YOU WANT TO SEE IT.
>> Mayor Mei: MY APOLOGIES, I'M JUST LOOKING AT THE TIME RIGHT NOW, AND I 
20:42:45 THINK WE HAVE COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU STILL HAD COMMENTS TO MAKE, BUT WE WILL NEED A BREAK FOR 
20:42:50 THE STENOCAPTIONER BEFORE WE RETURN FOR PUBLIC COMMENT BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN GOING FOR OVER AN HOUR AND A HALF, AND 
20:42:54 SO WE DO NEED AT LEAST A QUICK FIVE TO 10 MINUTE BREAK FOR THE STENOCAPTIONER.

20:43:00 >> Councilmember Jones: I'LL RESERVE THE REST OF MY COMMENTS FOR LATER AND LET COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN TO GO AHEAD.

20:43:05 >> Mayor Mei: DID YOU HAVE SOME COMMENTS TO MAKE BEFORE WE GO TO BREAK?

20:43:10 >> Councilmember Salwan: A QUICK QUESTION, I THINK YOU MENTIONED IT BUT WILL THERE BE STAFF DEDICATED TO 
20:43:17 MANAGING THE VARIOUS SITES AND PREVENT CONFLICTS OR COORDINATION, WILL WE HAVE ADEQUATE STAFFING FOR THAT?

20:43:28 >> SO I CAN GIVE A BROAD OVERVIEW AND MAYBE SUZANNE CAN GET INTO IT MORE DETAIL BUT THE WAY THE PROGRAM IS 
20:43:35 INTENDED TO BE DESIGNED AND THE WAY WE'VE SEEN IT DONE IN OTHER CITIES IS TO HAVE VOLUNTEERS FROM THE HOST SITES 
20:43:41 BEING THE SITE MANAGERS IN THE EVENING RESPONSIBLE FOR INTAKE OR ON CALL SHOULD ANY ISSUE ARISE.

20:43:47 THERE THEN WOULD BE A CITY STAFF PERSON WHO WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR MANAGING OVERHEAD OPERATIONS SUCH AS 
20:43:55 COORDINATION BETWEEN MULTIPLE DIFFERENT SITE COORDINATORS OR ADDRESSING ANY REPEATED ISSUES THAT NEED TO GET 
20:44:00 ESCALATED TO A CITY LEVEL, BUT THAT PERSON WOULD NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DAY TO DAY MANAGEMENT OF THE 
20:44:05 SITES.
ALL THE DAY TO DAY MANAGEMENT WOULD BE DONE BY THE HOST ORGANIZATIONS.

20:44:10 >> Councilmember Salwan: OKAY, THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: GREAT.

20:44:17 THANK YOU.
AT THIS TIME, WE'LL TAKE A  QUICK -- WE'LL RETURN BACK AT 8:55 FOR A 
20:44:22 10-MINUTE BREAK.
THANK YOU.
PLEASE TURN OFF YOUR MICS AND YOUR 
20:55:16 SCREENS DURING THE BREAK.

>> Mayor Mei:   WELCOME BACK.

20:55:50 WELCOME BACK TO OUR AGENDA MEETING, THIS CITY COUNCIL MEETING THIS EVENING.

20:55:57 AND WE'LL RETURN NOW TO THE PUBLIC COMMENT, AND I APPRECIATE THE PATIENCE OF THE SPEAKERS THIS EVENING.

20:56:03 I'D LIKE TO CALL THE FIRST SPEAKER, FROM THE AUDIENCE.
AND THAT WOULD BE CHUNG.

20:56:14 WELCOME CHUNG.
>> AM I ON?
HELLO?

20:56:19 >> Mayor Mei:   YES, YOU ARE ON.
>> THANK YOU MAYOR.
IT'S GOOD TO HELP THE HOMELESS.

20:56:27 BUT IT MUST BE DONE RIGHTS.
PUBLIC SAFETY IS PARAMOUNT.
THERE HAS NOT BEEN A PROPER  OUTREACH 
20:56:32 EFFORT FROM FREMONT CITIZENS ABOUT THIS ORDINANCE CHANGE.
IT IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH TO PUT UP A 
20:56:39 WEBSITE AND EXPECT PEOPLE TO AUTOMATICALLY SEE THE INFORMATION.
THE VAST MAJORITY OF FREMONT RESIDENTS 
20:56:44 ARE STILL UNINFORMED ABOUT THIS ORDINANCE CHANGE.
WHICH WILL HAVE MANY IMPACTS TO PUBLIC 
20:56:51 SAFETY.
WHERE IS THE TRANSPARENCY?
THE NUMEROUS PROBLEMS WITH THE 
20:57:02 ORDINANCE, I DISAGREE THAT THE ORDINANCE IS EXEMPT FROM CEQA, WITH ALL THE IMPACTS ON NEIGHBORHOOD 
20:57:07 SAFETY.
ALSO ON PROGRAMS IN OTHER  CITIES, THERE IS NO TIME FOR PARKING IN THE 
20:57:13 ORDINANCE.
THEY CAN PARK AS LONG AS THEY WISH.
FIVE IS HIGHLY QUESTIONABLE AND THERE 
20:57:18 IS NO REQUIREMENT FOR VEHICLE INSURANCE, WHAT?
VALUED DRIVER'S LICENSE IS NOT 
20:57:21 NEEDED.
THIS IS CRAZY.
VEHICLE CAN BE AS CLOSE AS 20 FEET 
20:57:28 FROM A RESIDENTIAL  PROPERTY.
WHICH IS NOTHING.
I CAN GO ON WITH THE PROBLEMS ABOUT 
20:57:35 THE ORDINANCE BUT PERHAPS WHAT IS MOST TROUBLING IS THE COMMENT MADE BY ONE OF THE CITY PLANNING COMMISSIONERS WHO 
20:57:40 THOUGHT THAT THE ORDINANCE SHOULD BE USED ONLY
AS GUIDELINES, OR RECOMMENDATIONS, AS 
20:57:47 OPPOSED TO MANDATES.
SO THE ORDINANCE, WITH MORE HOLES THAN SWISS CHEESE IS GOING TO BE WATERED 
20:57:54 DOWN EVEN MORE AND NOT ENFORCED?
HOW ACCOUNT CITIZENS OF FREMONT TRUST THAT THE RIGHT THINGS WILL BE DONE?

20:58:04 PLEASE CONDUCT A PROPER PUBLIC OUTREACH EFFORT AND HOLD A PROPER PUBLIC HEARING TO ENSURE THAT THE PROPER 
20:58:10 APPROACH OF HELPING THE HOMELESS IS CREATED WITH CONSULTATION WITH THE FREMONT COMMUNITY.

20:58:17 YES, WE DO WANT TO HELP THE  HOMELESS BUT WE NEED TO DID IT THE RIGHT WAY AND MAKE SURE THAT PUBLIC SAFETY IS 
20:58:26 ENSURED.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU, NEXT 
20:58:37 SPEAKER IS LISA DANS.
>> HI I'M LISA DANS FROM DISTRICT 3.
I'M IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THE ORDINANCE 
20:58:46 AND WANT TO THANK THE STAFF FOR HARD WORK PUTTING IT TOGETHER.
INTIFL I SUPPORT THE RECOMMENDATIONS, 
20:58:52 TO MOVE FORWARD AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE WITH THE SECOND AND THIRD PRONGS OF THE SAFE HOUSING APPROACH IN ADDITION 
20:59:03 TO THAT FIRST PRONG.
SECOND AND THIRD, MEETING FOLKS WHERE THEY ARE WITH RL DUMPSTERS AND THESE 
20:59:12 SAFE PARKING SPOTS PLAYED BY VOLUNTEERS FAITH BASED INSTITUTIONS, ARE GOING TO BE REALLY WONDERFUL BUT ALSO ADDRESS 
20:59:16 ONLY PART
OF THE NEED.
THE ROTATIONAL NATURE AND  LIMITED 
20:59:27 CAPACITY OF THE SIETLE WILL NEED DOZENS OF SITES TO SUPPORT OUR 200 PLUS RESIDENTS LIVING IN THEIR VEHICLES.

20:59:34 LEAVES OUT MANY VIC DWELLERS WHO COULD ALSO BENEFIT FROM SAFE PARKING.
SO WE NEED MORE CAPACITY AND WREEZ 
20:59:39 NEED EVEN MORE INCLUSIVE CAPACITY AND THAT IS WHAT A CITY OWNED SITE COULD REALLY HELP ADDRESS.

20:59:45 AND THIS OTHER PRONG OF MEETING PEOPLE WHERE THEY ARE WITH AMENITIES JUST MAKES GOOD SENSE.

20:59:52 I RECALL FROM A PREVIOUS MEETING THAT STAFF HAD MENTIONED IT HAD ALREADY PILOTED AND REALLY BENEFITED THE WHOLE 
20:59:58  NEIGHBORHOOD, BOTH HOUSED AND  UNHOUSED RESIDENTS.
AND TO SORT OF REMIND FOLKS, THIS HAS 
21:00:02 BEEN BROUGHT UP BUT THERE HAVE BEEN SOME CONCERNS.
WE ALREADY HAVE PEOPLE LIVING IN THEIR 
21:00:06 CARS.
THIS IS NOT ABOUT ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO LIVE IN THEIR CARS.

21:00:12 THIS IS ABOUT PROVIDING ACCESS TO STABILITY.
IF PUTTING YOURSELF IN THE SHOES OF 
21:00:17 SOMEBODY LIVING IN THEIR CAR IF YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO PARK THAT NIGHT AND YOU DON'T 
21:00:22 HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT GETTING HARASSED AND PARKING
ON THE STREET AND BEING IN YOUR CAR 
21:00:28 YOU'RE LIKELY TO HAVE BETTER TREES LOWER STRESS AND THAT MAY BE NECESSARY TO MAKE OTHER CRITICAL ACTIVITIES LIKE 
21:00:32 WORKING AND STUDYING.
AND WE KNOW THAT A LOT OF THE FOLKS LIVING IN VEHICLES ARE ADMINISTRATOR 
21:00:38 WORKING AND IT'S REALLY GOING TO BE A BENEFIT TO MAKE IT EASIER TO DO THAT WORK IN A LOWER STRESSED ENVIRONMENT.

21:00:44 I ALSO WANTED TO DECREASE THE CONCERN THAT WAS RAISED EARLIER ABOUT THE DRIVER'S LICENSE REQUIREMENTS.

21:00:53 I WANT -- AND SINCE THE CURRENT VERSION IS NOTED AS THE BEST PRACTICES IN OTHER CITIES, THAT MEANS THERE'S CLEAR 
21:01:01 PRECEDENCE FOR THIS POLICY.
I WOULD URGE THE CITY COUNCIL TO PASS THIS ORDINANCE WITHOUT DELAY, 
21:01:05 HOPEFULLY WITHOUT PLANNING COMMISSION RECOMMENDATIONS.
THANK YOU.

21:01:11 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU, NEXT SPEAKER IS HELEN.
HELEN, THANK YOU.

21:01:16 >> CAN YOU HEAR ME?
>> Mayor Mei:   YES.
>> OKAY COOL.

21:01:25 YOU KNOW THIS PROGRAM AT LEAST HAVE A GOOD INTENTION OR THE NAME SOUNDS, IT'S SAFE PARKING BUT AT THE SAME 
21:01:31 TIME, DOES IT PROVIDE SAFETY FOR PEOPLE LIVE NEARBY LIKE FOR EXAMPLE I LIVE NEARBY CAN YOU

21:01:40  CUMP, I'M VERY CONCERNED, I DON'T THINK IT'S A GOOD NAME OKAY?
WHAT HAPPENED IN IRVINGTON IS VERVE 
21:01:47 SHOCKING TO ME.
IT'S DAYLIGHT TIME, 11:00 IN THE MORNING THIS THING COULD HAPPEN.

21:01:54 IT'S BECOME NATIONAL NEWS IMMEDIATELY.
I HOPE FREMONT WILL TAKE THESE THINGS MORE SERIALS.

21:02:00 HELP HOMELESS PEOPLE OF COURSE, BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE HAVE TO HELP THE PEOPLE LIVING IN THE CITY.

21:02:07 THING I HOPE, CITY TRIED TO DO THE AGENCY EARLIER WHICH IS A GOOD EFFORT, APPRECIATE  EVERYONE'S TIME.

21:02:16 AND I THINK THE CITY DOES A GOOD JOB TO CHOOSE CITY HALL AS A PLACE SO CAN WE PUT A SECOND LEVEL THERE AND PUT A 
21:02:24 PARKING LOT NEAR THAT PLACE SO IT'S EASIER TO MANAGE.
OKAY SO IF AGENCY THE PARKING SPACE IS 
21:02:31 NOT A GOOD CHOICE CAN WE CONSIDER POLICE DEPARTMENT PARKING LOT?
BECAUSE IT'S EASIER TO MANAGE ALSO.

21:02:38 AND WE HAVE BUDGET ALREADY, IF THE PARKING LOT IS NOT BIG ENOUGH THERE'S PLENTY OF SPACE BETWEEN THE POLICE 
21:02:42 STATION AND CENTRAL PARK.
THERE'S, YOU KNOW, A LOT OF LAND AVAILABLE.

21:02:50 WE CAN JUST BUILD A PARKING LOT THERE.
SO PLEASE TAKE CARE OF THE SAFETY EASILY, MUCH EASIER THAN IN THE CHURCH 
21:02:56 OR SOMETHING.
SO AT THE LEAST PEOPLE LIKE ME WHO LIVE NEARBY CHURCH ALREADY I DON'T 
21:03:03 HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT IT.
SO PLEASE YOU KNOW CITY DID GOOD JOB LAST TIME SO I THINK PLEASE THIS TIME, 
21:03:09 EITHER THE POLICE STATION OR JUST USE AGENCY AS A RESOURCE.
INSTEAD OF CHANGING THE ZONING FOR THE 
21:03:15 WHOLE CITY.
THAT'S TOO BIG DEAL AND WE WOULD NEED A PUBLIC HEARING YOU KNOW, MORE 
21:03:20 PUBLIC, MORE PEOPLE TO NOTE ABOUT THE POTENTIAL ISSUES.
THANKS.

21:03:26 SO THAT'S ALL I WANTED TO SAY.
THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU, NEXT 
21:03:33 SPEAKER IS ROB BRINDLE.
>> HI.
I TOOK A COUPLE OF NOTES.

21:03:41 I DO LIKE THE IDEA OF HELPING THE HOMELESS AND I THINK IT'S VERY NOBLE.
ONE OF MY QUESTIONS WAS, IS THIS PART 
21:03:49 OF A COORDINATED PLAN?
WHAT I HEARD WAS ABSOLUTELY NOT.
THIS IS A PIECEMEAL APPROACH TO TRY TO 
21:03:56 DO SOMETHING, RIGHT, TO TAKE ACTION.
BUT NOT A COORDINATED PLAN THAT SAYS, YOU KNOW, HOW ARE WE GOING TO GIVE 
21:04:02 THESE PEOPLE AN ABILITY TO EARN ENOUGH INCOME TO ACTUALLY LIVE IN FREMONT?
TO PRETEND THAT THEY'RE GOING TO COME 
21:04:11 UP WITH THE SKILL SET OR GET A JOB THAT'S GOING TO ALLOW THEM TO LIVE IN FREMONT AND PAY THE BILLS AROUND HERE, 
21:04:16 I DON'T SEE IT.
YOU HAVE GOOGLE.
YOU HAVE A LOT OOF WHITE COLLAR WELL 
21:04:19 PAID PEOPLE.
YOU HAVE A LIMITED AMOUNT OF PROPERTY.

21:04:27 YOU HAVE A LIMITED AMOUNT OF HOUSING.
THIS EFFORT IS, YOU KNOW, IN THE END IT CANNOT BE SUSTAINED.

21:04:33 UNLESS YOU'RE GOING TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT CREATING MORE HOUSING, ALL YOU'RE DOING IS YOU'RE CREATING A 
21:04:40 SECOND CLASS COMMUNITY OF PERMANENT PEOPLE IN THE CAR.
I THINK IT'S SHAMEFUL.

21:04:48 I THINK THAT PEOPLE, WE HAVE DO DO MORE THAN LET PEOPLE PARK ON THE STREET AND SAY THAT'S OUR ANSWER.

21:04:57 MORE PARKING ON THE STREET.
ANOTHER QUESTION I HAD WAS, YOU TALK ABOUT THE ZONING ORDINANCE.

21:05:04 THIS IS SLIPPERY SLOPE WHICH I THINK IS PRETTY TRICKY.
BECAUSE ONCE YOU'RE OPENING THE ZONING 
21:05:12 YOU NEED A PERMIT FOR WHAT?
THE ZONING SAYS YOU CAN PARK, RIGHT WILLIAM IF YOU SAY I'M GOING OCHANGE 
21:05:20 THE ZONING SO YOU CAN PARK ON THE STREET, WHY DO YOU NEED A PERMIT?
WHY DOES THE CHURCH NOT ALLOW PEOPLE 
21:05:26 TO DO IT NOW?
BECAUSE DID ZONING STOPS THEM.
ONCE YOU CHANGE THE ZONING YOU OPEN 
21:05:32 EVERYTHING UP, THE PERMIT FOR WHAT?
SO I DON'T SEE THE COORDINATION.
THE PHASE 2 THAT'S THE REAL TRICKY 
21:05:39 ONE.
THAT'S THE ONE WHERE MY UNDERSTANDING OF PHASE 2 IS THAT YOU'RE GOING TO 
21:05:50 TAKE THIS  ZONING, START WITH PHASE 1, PILOT PROGRAM IN A SAFE AREA, WHICH AREAS ARE OKAY, THE INDUSTRIAL AREA, 
21:05:52 HOW ABOUT
IRVINGTON.
HOW ABOUT WE START WITH MISSION SAN 
21:05:59 JOSE.
BE WHY DON'T WE SEE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE SAY RANDOM HOMELESS PEOPLE CAN PARK 
21:06:06 IN MISSION SAN JOSE.
ANY PEOPLE WHO LIVE THERE, THEY MIGHT SAY ABSOLUTELY NOT BUT IRVINGTON OKAY, 
21:06:16 WE'LL LET THEM PARK IN IRVINGTON.
ARE WE HELPING RESIDENTS OF FREMONT?
IS THERE A REASON THE SAY, YOU LIVED 
21:06:26 IN FREMONT FOR ONE OR TWO YEARS OR LONGER, YOU'VE GONE THROUGH A SPECIAL ISSUE, A FIXED AMOUNT OF TIME IF YOU 
21:06:30 CAN'T RESOLVE YOUR ISSUES WITHIN THE A FIXED AMOUNT
OF TIME, ONE, TWO YEARS THEN YOU HAVE 
21:06:38 TO MOVE ON AND ACCEPT REALITY.
THAT YOU'RE BEING PRICED OUT.
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

21:06:45 NEXT SPEAKER IS HENRY.
>> GOOD EVENING, DEAR MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL.

21:06:50 CAN YOU HEAR ME?
HELLO?
CAN CAN YOU HEAR ME?

21:07:00 >> Mayor Mei:   YES.
>> OH, SORRY, OKAY.
YEAH, SO BASICALLY, I ACTUALLY, I 
21:07:05 SUPPORT ACTUALLY SAFE PARKING AS A PRINCIPLE.
I THINK THIS IS A NOBLE IDEA AND THIS 
21:07:11 IS TO HELP ACTUALLY OUR  UNHOUSED FRIENDS.
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND I KIND OF AGREE 
21:07:22 WITH OTHER SPEAKER, IS I'M OPPOSED ACTUALLY IS THE CAR  OUTINGS AND CAR DEFAULT FOR TWO REASONS.

21:07:31 I THINK ACTUALLY IS, ZONING IS EXEMPT FOR A REASON.
WE HAVE RESIDENTIAL ZONING WE HAVE 
21:07:41 COMMERCIAL ZONING, WE HAVE A LONG DOCUMENT R-1, R-2, SINGLE HOUSE ZONING AND ALL OF A SUDDEN WE ARE THROUGH ALL 
21:07:47 THE ZONING ACTUALLY REQUIREMENT TO THE WATER AND
BASICALLY SAY YOU CAN DO WHATEVER YOU 
21:07:54 WANT.
I WOULD SAY INSTEAD ACTUALLY THROW AWAY WHOLE ZONING PROCESS, RIGHT NOW 
21:08:06 FOLLOW THE FOR EXAMPLE MOBILE PARK, THAT KIND OF PROCESS.
SECOND REASON I OPPOSE, I WANT TO ECHO 
21:08:17 WHAT ACTUALLY COUNCILMEMBER COX WHAT SHE SAID.
THERE IS NO STANDARD, NO SCREENING AND 
21:08:24 THERE'S NO ACTUALLY ACCOUNTABILITY OF THIS QUOTE UNQUOTE SAFE PARKING ZONE.
ZONING.

21:08:38 AND SO HYPOTHETICALLY I DON'T WANT TO CREATE A FEAR BUT IT COULD HAPPEN SEE IF THERE'S SEX OFFENDER, LEAVING ANY 
21:08:44 OF THE SAFE PARKING LOT, FOLLOWING  THIS, THERE IS NO WAY YOU CAN PREVENT IT AND

21:08:50 IN THE CAR, THE CAR ACTUALLY IS DOCUMENT THERE IS NO SUCH THING PREVENT THAT HAPPEN.

21:09:00 SO I ABSOLUTELY SUPPORT THIS NOBLE IDEA BUT ACTUALLY IN THE CURRENT FORM I THINK THIS IS IN THE BEST SHAPE AND 
21:09:05 ALTHOUGH WITHOUT CONSIDER WHAT THE IMPLICATION TO THE COMMUNITY.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

21:09:24 >> Mayor Mei:   NEXT SPEAKER IS BEN YEE.
>> GOOD EVENING, MAYOR MEI AND MEMBERS 
21:09:30 OF THE CITY COUNCIL.
I COME BEFORE YOU AS A PRIVATE CITIZEN WANTING TO SHARE MY EXPERIENCES 
21:09:41 VISITING ALL FIVE SAFE PARKING SITES IN UNION  CITY, LIVERMORE SAN JOSE AND SANTA BARBARA WHICH HAS ONE OF THE 
21:09:46 LONGEST RUN
NING SAFE PARKING PROGRAMS IN 2004.
LET ME START BY DISPELLING SOME MYTHS 
21:09:50 THAT THE PUBLIC IS SAYING ON SOCIAL MEDIA.
THE PROPOSED ORDINANCE TONIGHT DOES 
21:09:57 NOT SAY IT ALLOWS PARKING ANYWHERE.
EACH SITE MUST MEET MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR SPACE AND SERVICES AS 
21:10:04 STATED IN THE PROPOSED ORDINANCE.
AFTER SPEAKING WITH THE THREE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS IN LIVERMORE SAN 
21:10:09 JOSE AND SANTA BARBARA THEY OPENED MY EYES AS TO WHO WOULD BE USING THESE SITES.

21:10:15 IT IS NOT THE HOMELESS THAT ARE DRUG USERS OR HAVE MENTAL  ILLNESS.
THEY ARE THE WORKING CORE, THOSE WHO 
21:10:27 LOST THEIR JOBS AND HOMES AND HAVE NOWHERE TOLLS GO.
I WAS SADDENED TO LEARN THAT THOSE 
21:10:36 LIVING IN THE CARS CONSIDER DOCTORS, NURSES, STUDENTS, THESE SITES ARE MONITORED AN THE PEOPLE USING THESE 
21:10:40 SITES JUST WANT TO BE LEFT ALONE AS I WAS TOLD.
IN FACT WHEN I SPOKE WITH THE 
21:10:49 RESIDENTS IN UNION CITY AT ALL FIVE SITES, FOUR OF THE CHURCHES AND ONE AT A SENIOR CENTER, THE RESIDENTS THOUGHT 
21:10:57 THESE CARS WERE FOR A HE MOOGHT.
NONE OF THE RESIDENTS AT THESE SITES THOUGHT THESE WERE USED FOR THIS 
21:11:02 PURPOSE.
THE PROGRAM IN UNION CITY HAS BEEN IN PLACE SINCE 2016.

21:11:09 MOST OF THESE SITES DO NOT OPERATE 24 HOURS A DAY.
THEY FOUND MANY OF THESE SITE USERS 
21:11:17 HAVE TO GO TO SCHOOL OR WORK.
THESE PROVIDE SERVICES TO HELP THESE HOMELESS LIVING IN THEIR VEHICLES TO 
21:11:24 GET BACK ON THEIR JOBS AND A ROOF OVER THEIR  HEADS.
INSTEAD OF CONTRIBUTING TO TRASH AND 
21:11:31 WASTE, WOULDN'T IT BE BETTER TO HAVE A ADDITIONAL CLEAN SITE TO ELIMINATE THE TRASH AND WASTE PRODUCED.

21:11:41 THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.
NEXT SPIEKER, ANNIE HE.

21:11:48 WELCOME ANNIE.
>> THANK YOU.
THANK YOU MAYOR AND RESPECTED 
21:12:02 COUNCILMEMBERS, MY NAME IS ANNIE HE I LIVE IN THE IRVINGTON AREA.
ZONING IS A BLUEPRINT OF THE CITY.

21:12:12 AFFECTING ENTIRE CITY RESIDENTS.
WHAT KIND OF PUBLIC ENRICH VICE PRESIDENT YOU DOWN FOR THIS ACT?

21:12:20 FOR ANY SMALL DEVELOPMENT, I -- HAPPENS TO BE IN THIS FIELD, I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE MINIMUM 300 FEET NOTIFICATION 
21:12:24 WHICH YOU SEND TO THE NEIGHBORS LET THEM KNOW THERE IS A PROJECT, THERE IS A DEVELOPMENT

21:12:32 GOING ON.
BUT THE CITYWIDE ZONING CHANGE IS CHANGING THE CITY'S BLUEPRINT FROM 
21:12:37 CERTAIN PERSPECTIVE.
I'M CURIOUS WHAT KIND OF PUBLIC NOTIFICATION HAVE YOU DONE?

21:12:45 I JUST LEARNED A FEW HOURS AGO, THIS IS GOING TO HAPPEN TONIGHT, THAT'S WHY I JUMP ON TO THE CALL JUST TO LISTEN.

21:12:50 SECOND QUESTION:  I HEARD FROM STAFF RIGHT NOW YOU HAVE CARE ACT MONEY FOR FOUR AND A HALF YEARS.

21:12:56 WHAT ABOUT CHANGE THE ZONING THAT'S ALMOST YOU'RE CHANGING THE LAW FOR THE CITY.

21:13:00 WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN AFTER FOUR AND A HALF YEARS?
WHAT IS YOUR PLAN?

21:13:11 THE THIRD ONE IS, JUST WANT TO CLARIFY COUNCILMEMBER JONES EARLIER, IS THERE ANY POLICE INVOLVED?

21:13:17 THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN POLICE AND CITY STAFF TO REVIEW THE PERMIT.
AND POLICE BE AWARE OF WHO'S ON THE 
21:13:25 SITE AND WHEN?
THERE'S A DIFFERENCE.
REVIEW THE PERMIT, ISSUE PERMIT CITY 
21:13:30 STAFF IS DONE WITH IT.
THERE IS A DIFFERENCE POLICE BE AWARE, WHAT KIND OF ACTIVITY WHO IS ON THE 
21:13:36 SITE THAT DAY.
AND ONE OF THE CALLS STAFF MENTIONED, THE REASON WE'RE DOING THIS BECAUSE 
21:13:45 THERE IS A 15 TO 20 CARS RIGHT NOW, ONE OR TWO SITES, HARD TO MANAGE THE ONE TO EXPAND BUT MY QUESTION IS AS YOU

21:13:52 CHANGE THE ZONING FOR THE CITY MORE, I'M SURE MORE CARS WILL BE ROLLED INTO THE FREMONT AND HOW ARE YOU GOING TO 
21:14:00 MANAGES WHEN THAT 17 TO 20 BECOME 100 TO 200?
ANOTHER POINT IS HAVE YOU THOUGHT 
21:14:08 ABOUT THE TRIAL OUT PILOT?
I APPRECIATE CITY TRIED THE  HOMELESS SHELTER, THAT'S IN THE CITY PARKING 
21:14:15 LOT.
SO FOR THIS, I RECOMMEND FOR SOME KIND OF TRIAL OUT IF WE HAVE TO FOR THAT -- 
21:14:22 TO MOVE TO THAT DIRECTION AND I FULLY SUPPORT THAT DIRECTION.
COMING FROM CITY OF OAKLAND, I WORK 
21:14:27 THERE.
THERE'S A LOT OF SITES, THERE'S A LOT OF WASTE, HUMAN WASTE AND NEIGHBORS 
21:14:35 WERE COMPLAINED NEIGHBORS ARE SUFFERING.
WHAT KIND OF MITIGATION PLAN TO 
21:14:42 MITIGATE THE TRASH, THE WASTE AND ESPECIALLY THE CURRENT RESIDENTS WHO ARE LIVING THERE, YOU KNOW AS FAR AS 
21:14:48 WAS IT CONSIDERED, HAVE YOU LOOKED INTO THE CANNABIS LAW,
ARE THEY ALLOWED TO SMOKE, JUST DRUGS 
21:14:55 THERE?
THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei:   NEXT IS KEITH PARKER.

21:15:08 >> HELLO, SO I WANT DO COMMEND THE CITY COUNCIL.
I REALLY SUPPORT DOING SOMETHING TO 
21:15:18 HELP DEAL WITH THE HOMELESS SITUATION.
THE HOMELESS THAT ARE PARKING THROUGHOUT OUR CITY HAVE BECOME A 
21:15:22 SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM FOR THE CITY AS A WHOLE AS WELL AS THE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE SUFFERING FROM THIS.

21:15:28 AND I'M REALLY GLAD TO SEE THAT ACTION IS BEING TAKEN TO DO SOMETHING.
BUT AT THE SAME TIME, ACTION NEEDS TO 
21:15:33 HAVE A PURPOSE.
IT CAN'T BE ACTION SIMPLY FOR THE SAKE OF MOTION.

21:15:41 IT CAN'T BE SIMPLY SHUFFLING PEOPLE AROUND THE CITY.
IF THE GOAL IS TO HAVE SOME NUMBER OF 
21:15:51 VEHICLES MOVED FROM THE LOCATIONS THEY'RE AT, TO DIFFERENT SITES THROUGHOUT CITY, THEN WHAT WE'VE DONE 
21:15:58 IS TAKEN CARS THAT WERE PARKED IN ONE PLACE AND LEFT SOME
THERE AND MOVED OTHERS TO OTHER PLACES 
21:16:04 SO WE'VE SPREAD THE PROBLEM FROM THE PLACES THEY'RE AT TO MORE PLACES THROUGHOUT THE CITY.

21:16:11 I'M VERY MUCH IN SUPPORT OF SECTIONS 2 AND 3 OF THE PLAN.
I THINK THOSE HAVE A LOT OF PROMISE.

21:16:17 AND IF IMPLEMENTED PROPERLY COULD DO SOME GOOD.
BUT SIMPLY MOVING PEOPLE AROUND THE 
21:16:24 CITY AND EXPECTING THEM TO MOVE FROM PLACE TO PLACE ON A DAILY BASIS, PUTS STRESS ON  THEM.

21:16:33 IT MAKES IT HARDER FOR THEM.
WHERE IS THE INCENTIVE FOR THEM TO MOVE FROM THE SET PLACE THEY'RE AT, 
21:16:42 MOVE FROM PLACE TO PLACE IN A CAR OR VEHICLE THAT MAY NOT BE SAFE TO DRIVE, MAY ON THE CITY UP TO LIABILITY, WHEN 
21:16:46 THERE'S
ACCIDENTS, BECAUSE THEY'RE MOVING AROUND WHEN THEY OTHERWISE WOULDN'T 
21:16:56 BE, TO PLACES THAT REALLY PROVIDE THEM WITH VERY LITTLE.
IT PROVIDES THEM WITH WHAT, A PORTA 
21:17:04 POTTY, PORTABLE WASH STATION SO THEY CAN PUMP SOME WATER OUT OF A HOSE?
THERE'S NO STRONG BENEFIT THERE.

21:17:09 AND THAT'S WHY CITIES LIKE LIVERMORE THAT HAVE IMPLEMENTED THIS ARE TURNING IT OFF.

21:17:14 BECAUSE PEOPLE HAVEN'T BEEN INTERESTED.
THEY HAVEN'T GOTTEN THE ADOPTION FROM 
21:17:21 THE HOMELESS COMMUNITY.
WE COULD HAVE SO MUCH BETTER IMPACTS IF WE TOOK THESE FUNDS AND PUT THEM TO 
21:17:27 PREVENTING  HOMELESSNESS.
AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PRESENTATION WHAT ARE THE FIRST THINGS THAT CITY 
21:17:32 STAFF SAID, IS THAT FOR EVERY PERSON THAT COMES OUTS OF HOMELESSNESS, THREE ENTER.

21:17:39 WHAT IF WE COULD TAKE THESE SAME FUNDS AND APPLY THEM TO  PREVENTING THOSE THREE PEOPLE FROM BECOMING HOMELESS?

21:17:46 WOULDN'T THAT HAVE A BETTER IMPACT?
ISN'T IT BETTER TO PROVIDE THESE FUNDS TO PREVENT THE  HOMELESSNESS IN THE 
21:17:52 FIRST PLACE?
KEEP THOSE THREE PEOPLE FROM BECOMING HOMELESS RATHER THAN HELP THAT ONE.

21:17:57 WOULDN'T THAT BE MORE IMPACTFUL TO MORE PEOPLE ACROSS THE CITY?
THANK YOU.

21:18:07 >> Mayor Mei:   NEXT SPEAKER IS BLAIR BEEKMAN.
>> HI, THANK YOU.

21:18:15 BLAIR BEEKMAN HERE.
FROM LIVING IN SAN JOSE, FOR A NUMBERING OF YEARS, THEY'VE BEEN 
21:18:24 REALLY PRACTICING THE SAFE  PARKING PROGRAM FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS NOW.
THEY STARTED WITH THE IDEA OF WORKING 
21:18:35 WITHIN CHURCHES.
AND THEY DID THAT FOR A FEW YEARS AND THEN STARTED BRANCHING OUT TO THEIR 
21:18:44 LOCAL PUBLIC  PARKING PLACES THAT WERE AVAILABLE.
AND I, YOU KNOW, PERSONALLY, I WANTED 
21:18:52 TO SEE WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE TO WORK THE PUBLIC PARKING ROUTE, THE PUBLIC PARKING LOT ROUTE.

21:19:02 I GUESS IT'S MY PERCENTAGE FEELING THAT THE INITIAL CHURCH IDEA WAS A MUCH SIMPLER AND MORE ORGANIZED PLAN.

21:19:09 BUT I DON'T THINK INVOLVED CALLING THE POLICE ABOUT OR CONFIRMING WITH THE POLICE  ABOUT, AND THAT I FEEL 
21:19:14 SHOULDN'T HAVE TO.
AND TO QUICKLY MENTION THE WORDS OF THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER THAT YOU KNOW FOR 
21:19:22 -- FOR A FEW SPEAKERS TONIGHT, YOU KNOW, THE IMPORTANCE OF PLANNING FOR HOUSING, FOR THE FUTURE OF THE 
21:19:28 COMMUNITIES IS
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT.
BUT TO CREATE AN ORGANIZED SAFE SPACE 
21:19:34 FOR THE UNHOUSED SHOULD BE A REALLY IMPORTANT PART OF THE PROCESS AS WELL.

21:19:43 AND IT'S A MATTER OF YOU KNOW LEARNING HOW TO O UNDERSTAND THAT.
IT TAKES A LOT TO THINK THAT SO 
21:19:51 HOPEFULLY THESE WORDS CAN HELP.
TO OFFER AGAIN TO REALLY CONCENTRATE ON AFFORDABLE HOUSING IDEAS AT THIS 
21:19:57 TIME.
YOU KNOW, VERY LOW, EXTREMELY LOW INCOME IDEAS AND MIXED INCOME IDEAS.

21:20:03 I KNOW YOU'RE STARTING THOSE IDEAS NOW.
NEW CONCEPTS OF WHAT THAT COULD MEAN.

21:20:11 BUT TO NOT JUST GIVE IT, NOT PAY INTO AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT IS BASICALLY MARKET RATE HOUSING BUT TO REALLY 
21:20:23 CONCENTRATE ON FUNDING PROGRAMS THAT SPORT BLI AND EMI AND MIXED INCOME.
AND THAT TAKES A LOT OF EFFORT TO DO 
21:20:30 THAT.
YOU GUYS ARE JUST STARTING TO DO THAT, GOOD YOU LUCK ON HOW YOU CAN DO THAT, 
21:20:38 THE SAFE PARKING PROGRAM IN FREMONT, LOOKS TO BE LIKE SAN JOSE HAS WORKED, AND THEY HAVE A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT 
21:20:45 WAYS TO USE
THE SAFE PROGRAM PROGRAM.
YOU CAN PICK AND CHOOSE WHICH BETTER 
21:20:51 FITS THE FREMONT AREA AND LEARN FROM THEIR EXAMPLES AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.

21:21:02 >> Mayor Mei:   NEXT SPEAKER IS DAVID.
WELCOME.
>> HELLO, RESPECTED MAYOR AND 
21:21:08 RESPECTED COUNCILMEN AND WOMEN.
I WAS LISTENING TO THE COMMENTS, THE BIGGEST CONCERN FOR ME, I START OFF 
21:21:15 SAYING THERE IS DEFINITELY EMPATHY IN THE PUBLIC FOR HOMELESS PEOPLE.
AND SO DEFINITELY WE NEED TO DO 
21:21:24 SOMETHING ABOUT THIS BUT THE BIGGEST CONCERN IS AS HAS ALWAYS BEEN, YEARS OF PUBLIC SAFETY, WE NEED TO MAKE SURE 
21:21:31 THAT THESE PEOPLE ARE SCREENED, AND I JUST CASUALLY
HEARD I.D. BUT HOW STRONGLY THAT I.T. 
21:21:40 IS GOING TO BE VALIDATED, WE HAVE A LOT OF FAKE I.D.S GOING AROUND, SORRY TO SAY THAT, LAW AGUIDING CITIZENS 
21:21:49  ABIDING CITIZENS DON'T
THINK ABOUT THAT.
OPERATIONAL RESPECT TO THE PROGRAM 
21:21:56 THAT IS NOT VERY CLEAR AND GIVING COMFORT AT THE MOMENT TO THE PUBLIC.
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO GET THAT 
21:22:06 COMFORT LEVEL, FOR EXAMPLE, MEGAN'S LAW IS THERE FOR SEX OFFENDERS.
IF THE CITY IS ENABLING PEOPLE TO STAY 
21:22:12 AT A PARTICULAR PLACE IN A SENSE THEY'RE GIVING THEM SORT OF RESIDENTIAL CAPABILITY.

21:22:17 AND SO ARE THEY GOING TO BE REGISTERED WITH THAT, ARE THEY GOING TO SCREEN FOR THAT?

21:22:23 HOW IS THE POLICE GOING TO REACT IF A REPORT COMES THROUGH,  RIGHT?
AND I DON'T THINK THE POLICE 
21:22:28 DEPARTMENT IS BEING INVOLVED IN THIS AND THEIR INPUT SHOULD DEFINITELY BE TAKEN.

21:22:33 I WOULD SAY THIS IS HALF BAKED AT THE MOMENT, I'M SUPPORTIVE BUT WE NEED BETTER CONTROLS.

21:22:40 SO TONIGHT I'D URGE THE L COUNCIL TO TAKE THIS PROPOSAL BACK AND GIVE IT MORE THOUGHT WITH ALL THE PUBLIC 
21:22:48 FEEDBACK, RIGHT?
AT THE MOMENT ALL WE'VE DONE IS A PROPOSAL ON THE TABLE, THAT'S NOT WAY 
21:22:53 THINGS SHOULD BE DONE, NOT TRANSPARENCY.
THE PUBLIC IS SUPPORTIVE BUT NEEDS 
21:22:58 CONTROLS AND THAT'S WHAT GIVES THEM COMFORT.
TRUST THE COMPASSION OF THE CITIZENS 
21:23:08 OF FREMONT TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT RATHER THAN JUST SHOVE IT OFF DOWN WATER, AND SAY THAT WE'RE APPROVED.

21:23:16 I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT THOUGHT BEING GIVEN, TO GIVE THE PUBLIC THE COMFORT NEEDED.

21:23:23 THERE IS A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE WELL MEANING AND A BAD SITUATION YES DEFINITELY WE WOULD LIKE TO HELP THEM, 
21:23:29 ENABLE THEM BUT NOT THIS WAY, THIS IS NOT GIVING COMFORT TO PUBLIC THE WAY IT IS SHAPE AND

21:23:35 FORM THERE ARE NO CONTROLS, THERE IS NOTHING DOING THIS TO GIVE COMFORT TO THE PUBLIC THAT THIS CAN END UP BEING 
21:23:41 ABUSED IN A MANNER THAT IS NOT APPROPRIATE.
SO I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT, THANK 
21:23:49 YOU.
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU DAVID.
NEXT SPEAKER IS JASON.

21:24:02 WELCOME.
>> HELLO.
HELLO, HI, THAT'S ME.

21:24:08 GOOD EVENING, EVERYONE.
THANKS FOR THE ACTION AND SOME BACKGROUND INFORMATION.

21:24:20 I HONESTLY WOULD SUPPORT TO HAVE HOMELESS ON THE WAY TO CONSIDER THIS SITUATION, BUT WE CANNOT SUPPOSE A 
21:24:27 CURRENT FORM, LOOKS VERY RUSH, OKAY?
I APPRECIATE THE CHURCH AND THE CITY WORK TOGETHER TO RESULTS THE HOMELESS 
21:24:34 AND HELP THEM BUT IT LOOKS LIKE YOU KNOWING, YOU HAVE IGNORED AS A COMMUNITY.

21:24:41 FOR EXAMPLE THERE ARE SOME NEIGHBORS RESIDENTS NEAR CHURCH.
DID YOU ASK THEM, COMING IN NOISE 
21:24:46 INCOMING VISITORS, LOOKS LIKE NO, WE HAVEN'T HEARD IT.
THE SICK THING IS?

21:24:57 , I SAY SO FAR SO GOOD.
I THINK MANAGEMENT SHOULD CONTINUE THIS WAY TO FIND A GOOD PLACE AND OPEN 
21:25:05 SPACE AND MAYBE KIND OF DONATE MONEY AND VIOLENT TO BUILD A NEW PARKING LOTS, THE BEST THING IT WILL MINIMIZE 
21:25:11 YOUR COST AND
THERE IS NO FASTER RESPONSE YOU CAN SEND THE PEOPLE TO THE DEDICATED 
21:25:20 PLACE, YOU KNOW, IT'S SO SIMPLE AND EASY.
I DON'T SAY YOU CONSIDER SECOND 
21:25:27 OPTION, LOOKS LIKE OKAY YOU DISTRIBUTE DID EFFORT TO LOOK AT THE COMMUNITY BUT YOU N.O.D. WITH ALL THE 
21:25:34 CONSIDERATION UNTIL MARCH.
AGAIN I CAN'T SUPPORT CURRENT FORM BUT I SUPPORT TO HAVE  HOMELESS, ALL 
21:25:48 RIGHT, THAT'S ALL, THANKS EVERYONE.
>> Mayor Mei:   NEXT SPEAKER IS ARUN.
WELCOME.

21:25:54 >> HELLO, CAN YOU -- HELLO CAN YOU HEAR ME?
>> Mayor Mei:   YES.

21:26:01 >> HELLO, THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME AN OPPORTUNITIES TO TALK.
IT'S REALLY GOOD TO SEE THAT THE CITY 
21:26:08 IS TAKING STEPS TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS.
HOMELESSNESS IS A PROBLEM.

21:26:15 BUT THE ONLY ASK, BUT MY ASK IS TO DO A FORMAL OUTREACH AND GET PUBLIC SUPPORT.

21:26:28 BECAUSE THIS SEEM TO BE, EVEN THOUGH IT'S A -- DO WE WANT TO DO TO RIGHTS THING, BUT GAINING PUBLIC SUPPORT IS 
21:26:34 VERY IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT IS SUCCESSFUL.
ALSO, PLEASE MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE 
21:26:45 PROPER METRICS IN PLACE TO TEST, MAKE SURE THAT THIS PROGRAM IS WORKING.
BEFORE YOU PUT THIS INTO 
21:26:51 IMPLEMENTATION.
AS ONE OF THE PREVIOUS PERSONS STATED, WE NEED TO HAVE PROBLEMS THAT ADDRESS 
21:27:05 THE ROOT CAUSE OF SEEING HOW HOMELESSNESS CAN BE PREVENTED, RIGHT?
RATHER THAN PROVIDING L -- BEING 
21:27:11 REACTIVE.
SO HOW CAN -- WHAT CAN BE -- WHAT ACCOUNT CITY DO TO HELP PEOPLE GIVE 
21:27:16 THEM JOBS SO THAT THEY DON'T GET INTO THIS?
SO THAT IS MY ASK.

21:27:27 THANK YOU.
MANY.
>> Mayor Mei:   AT THIS TIME I'LL TURN 
21:27:37 IT BACK TO THE COUNCIL FOR DISCUSSION VICE MAYOR SHAO, AND ADVISE COMMENTS TOO.

21:27:49 VICE MAYOR SHAO WHY DON'T YOU BEGIN.
>> Councilmember Shao:   THANK YOU MAYOR.

21:28:01 I'M SURPRISED THAT NO VALID DMV REGISTRATION OR ARE DRIVER'S LICENSE IS REQUIRED BECAUSE WHAT IF THE CAR IS 
21:28:13 NOT EVEN PROBABLE AND EVENTUALLY WILL BECOME  NONOPERABLE, THAT IS
SEERNL SLIPPERY SLOPE TO THE 
21:28:18 ENCAMPMENT ON THE SITE.
THAT IS ONE OF MY CONCERNS.
SECOND THING IS THAT WE EVENTUALLY 
21:28:25 WOULD LIKE TO PROVIDE THEM WITH HELP SO THAT THEY CAN OVERCOME THOSE TEMPORARY  HARDSHIP.

21:28:33 AND EVENTUALLY, BECOME HOUSED AGAIN, JUST LIKE HOW WE TRY TO VIEW THAT NAVIGATION CENTER.

21:28:41 THAT IS OUR GOAL.
THEREFORE, WE WOULD DEFINITELY HELP THOSE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO HELP 
21:28:47 THEMSELVES AND THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING.
WHAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT IS WITHOUT 
21:28:59 THOSE DETAILS I DON'T KNOW US BY SIMPLY VOTING YES TO THE -- THIS ZONING CODE CHANGE, WOULD THEN LEAVE EVERYTHING 
21:29:02  ELSE, YOU KNOW, TO THE STAFF WITHOUT GETTING
THE DETAILS.

21:29:12 AND THEN ESPECIALLY FOR THE SCREENING PART, I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THAT.
I'M NOT SAYING THAT, YOU KNOW, THE 
21:29:18 CITY COUNCIL MEMBER NEEDS TO PARTICIPATE IN A SCREENING PROCESS BUT AT LEAST, I WOULD FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE 
21:29:28 VOTING YES TO THE CURRENT FORM, WITHOUT GETTING TO KNOW THE
SCREENING PROCESS EVENTUALLY.

21:29:37 BECAUSE I'M AFRAID AFTER I VOTE YES TODAY, AND THEN THAT'S IT, THEN BASICALLY, THE CITY STAFF WOULD GET 
21:29:44 ALL THE GREEN LIGHTS FOR THE SCREENING PROCESS.
I ALSO APPRECIATE THE FEEDBACK FROM 
21:29:57 THE COMMUNITY ABOUT THE  OUTREACH.
I DO BELIEVE THAT EVEN FOR THOSE PEOPLE WHO SPEAK TONIGHT AGAINST THE 
21:30:04 CURRENT FORUM, THEY STILL SUPPORT THE SAFE PARKING PROGRAM IN CONCEPT.
SO WHY DON'T WE JUST NOT RUSH INTO ANY 
21:30:19 DECISION BUT REALLY WORK WITH THE COMMUNITY TO REALLY GET THE -- AS MUCH SUPPORT AS WE CAN GET, AND GET 
21:30:25 INSURANCE -- NOT INSURANCE, ASSURANCE ABOUT DID SCREENING
PROCESS, ESPECIALLY THE REQUIREMENT 
21:30:32 FOR A LEGAL DRIVER'S LICENSE, A VALID ONE AND ALSO THE VALID VEHICLE REGISTRATION.

21:30:47 >> Mayor Mei:   COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN.
>> Councilmember Kassan:   THANK YOU.
I UNDERSTAND THERE ARE SOME CONCERNS 
21:30:53 ABOUT HAVING PEOPLE GATHERED TOGETHER AT A SITE.
BUT I JUST THINK WE CAN'T COMPARE THAT 
21:30:57 TO A PERFECT WORLD.
WE HAVE TO COMPARE IT TO THE CURRENT REALITY.

21:31:04 WHERE WE DO HAVE MORE AND MORE PEOPLE LIVING ALL OVER THE CITY IN THEIR CARS, AND DIFFERENT KINDS OF VEHICLES, 
21:31:08 AND WE'RE  GETTING A LOT OF COMPLAINTS ABOUT THAT.
AND IT'S VERY HARD TO CONTROL AND 
21:31:16 PEOPLE ARE SCATTERED ALL OVER THE CITY.
THIS IS REALLY -- IF WE  PROVIDE -- IF 
21:31:23 WE WORK WITH LOCAL CHURCHES AND NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS TO PROVIDE PLACES THAT HAVE FACILITIES, THAT HAVE 
21:31:30 OVERSIGHT, THAT ARE REGULATED, THAT ARE PLACES
WHERE PEOPLE ARE GATHERING WHERE OUR 
21:31:36 SERVICE PROVIDERS CAN COME AND GIVE PEOPLE THE HELP THEY NEED.
IT JUST SEEMS LIKE IT'S GOING TO BE 
21:31:43  SO'BETTER THAN THE CURRENT SITUATION.
SO I JUST THINK THAT IF, YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT LIKE WHETHER  WE -- IF WE 
21:31:51 PASS THIS TONIGHT, IT'S NOT LIKE MEET THIS IS GOING TO HAPPEN.
WE STILL HAVE TO WAITS FOR ANYONE TO 
21:31:59 WANT TO DO IN, AND THEN IT HAS TO GO THROUGH A PROCESS.
THE LONGER WE WAIT THE LONGER WE'RE 
21:32:07 DELAYINGFULLY KIND OF SOLUTION TO THE CURRENT CHRIS THAT'S ON OUR HANDS.
AS MUCH AS I WISH WE COULD HAVE A 
21:32:15 PERFECT WORLD WHERE WE COULD GUARANTEE THESE PLACES WOULD BE 100% PERFECT IN EVERY WAY IT'S NOT POSSIBLE BUT IT'S 
21:32:20 CURRENTLY BETTER THAN THE CURRENT SITUATION SO I
REALLY, REALLY DO HOPE WE ADOPT THIS 
21:32:30 TONIGHT.
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU COUNCILMEMBER JONES.

21:32:33 >> Councilmember Jones:   THANK YOU, MADAM MAYOR.
A COUPLE OF PEOPLE BROUGHT UP THE 
21:32:42 ISSUE DO WE CHANGE THE ZONING DOES THAT NOT GIVE DID PROPERTY OWNER TO PUT A SITE ON THEIR PROPERTY?

21:32:53 AND, YOU KNOW, THE THING I'M LOOKING AT IN THE STAFF REPORT IS IT SAYS YES, IT'S SUBJECT TO MINISTERIAL REVIEW BUT 
21:33:01 THEN IT GOKS ON FOR SAFE PARKING, HOST SITE STANDARDS.
I THINK THAT'S WHERE A LOT OF THIS 
21:33:10 DISCUSSION HAS BEEN, IS WHAT IS GOING TO BE THE STANDARD FOR THAT.
I'M NOT NECESSARILY OPPOSED, FIRST 
21:33:20 EITHER MAYBE MR. MARCH OR MS. MARGOLIS, WHY DOES THAT GIVE THAT SITE THE ABILITY TO HOST THE SITE OR IT 
21:33:24 CIRCULATE STILT HAVE TO GO THROUGH A PERMIT PROCESS, IS THAT
CORRECT?

21:33:33 THEY CAN'T GO AHEAD AND DO IT ON THEIR OWN BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE ZONING.
>> YOU'RE CORRECT, THEY HAVE TO SUBMIT 
21:33:47 A PERMIT, HUMAN SERVICES BUYER TRAINEE, RISK MANAGEMENT DIVISION.
THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH A MINISTERIAL 
21:33:51 PROGRAM.
WHAT'S BEFORE YOU TONIGHT IS A LAND USE DECISION.

21:34:00 YOU HAVE OTHER CONCERNS OF OTHER THINGS AND THEY'RE ALL VALID.
BUT THE OTHER THINGS OF  
21:34:06 DLEURCHDRIVER'S LICENSE ET CETERA, I'M NOT SAYING THAT I WANT TO YOU DO THAT BUT YOU COULD DIRECT STAFF TO BRING 
21:34:12 THAT BACK SO THAT YOU COULD DISCUSS THAT.
DPLOWZ THAT IS GOING TO PROLONG THE -- 
21:34:22 THIS PROGRAM, BY THE DIME WE GET BACK DO YOU IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO BE JULY OR CENTS WITH THIS SORTS OF PRIORITIZE 
21:34:30 AND POLICIES PARTNERED SCREENING  ITS,
WEE THINK WE AS STAFF CAN DO THAT BUT AGAIN THERE ARE TWO VERY DIFFERENT 
21:34:33 THINGS.
BEFORE YOU TONIGHT IS A LAND USE DECISION.

21:34:40 AS I SAID YOU CAN DIRECT US TO COME BACK AND SO DESIRE, I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT BUT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU 
21:34:48 COULD DO.
>> OKAY, SO PERSONALLY I DON'T HAVE MUCH OF AN ISSUE WITH THE ACTUAL 
21:35:01 ZONING CHANGE.
THIS IS A HUMAN ISSUE, 160,000 PEOPLE IN THIS START THAT ARE UNHOUSED AND I 
21:35:11 KNOW A LOT OF THE CONCERNS, YOU GET INTO  SITUATIONS LIKE THESE, I PUT THE AVAILABILITY IN ONE PARTICULAR

21:35:15 PLACE.
DOES IT DRAWS PEOPLE FROM OTHER CITIES?

21:35:27 NO, THAT'S SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED AT A REGIONAL ISSUE.
I DON'T THINK FAMILIES CAN SHARE THE 
21:35:38 BETTER FINANCIALLY ON THEIR OWN.
I'M THANKFUL THAT WHEN GOVERNOR NEWSOM EARMARKED A BIG PORTION OF THAT, I 
21:35:45 HAVE HEARD SUCCESSES IN OTHER CITIES WITH THIS PARTICULAR TYPE OF PROGRAM.
SO AGAIN I'M NOT OPPOSED TO THE ZONING 
21:35:53 CHANGE ITSELF, IT'S JUST THE OPERATIONAL STANDARDS AND MY CONCERNS OVER THE LIABILITY ISSUES OF ALLOWING 
21:36:02 UNLICENSED DRIVERS, UNINSURED VEHICLES.
JUST TO THROW IT OUT THERE, IF YOU 
21:36:12 HAVE AN RV PARKED SOMEWHERE AND THAT PROFANE TANK ON THE RV OR THE STOVE OR WHATEVER EXPLODES AND THEY HAVE NO 
21:36:16 INSURANCE WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT?
IS IT THE HOST SITE?
IS IT THE CITY?

21:36:22 WE HAVE APPROVED THE PERMIT FOR THE HOST SITE.
THOSE ARE SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT I 
21:36:28 THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE AND ALSO THE SCREENING PROCESS.
ONE GENTLEMAN MENTIONED IT WITH THE 
21:36:36 MEGAN'S LAW ISSUE.
HOW DO YOU KNOW WHO IS COMING INTO YOUR SITE IF YOU DON'T HAVE AT LEAST A 
21:36:40 BASIC SCREENING PROCESS?
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE EXTREMELY INTRUSIVE.

21:36:46 BUT I DON'T THINK JUST OPENING THE GATES AND ALLOWING ANYBODY AND EVERYBODY TO COME IN WITHOUT SOME 
21:36:59  ASSURANCES THAT IT IS AN OVERNIGHT PARKING, BUSINESSES NEED TO CONDUCT THEIR

21:37:14 BUSINESSES DURING THE OPENING HOUR.
YOU NEED TO HAVE A DRIVER'S LICENSE, A REGISTRATION, MAYBE IS THIS PART OF 
21:37:20 THE SAFE PARKING HOST SITE STANDARDS TO BUILD IN THOSE REQUIREMENTS?
AGAIN THE ZONING CHANGE ITSELF TO 
21:37:28 ALLOW IT FOR THE MINISTERIAL PROCESS I JUST WANT TO KNOW YOU KNOW THAT THAT MINISTERIAL PROCESS IS GOING TO BE 
21:37:34 THOROUGH.
I UNDERSTAND THE REQUEST FOR THE LOWS BARRIER ENTRY BUT I THINK IN THE LONG 
21:37:41 RUN YOU NEED TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT NOT ONLY THE SURROUNDING RESIDENTS BUT ANYBODY WHO IS GOING BY ON THE 
21:37:47 STREETS.
IF SOMEONE THAT'S UNLICENSED PULLS OUT OF THE DRIVEWAY AND CAUSES A COLLISION 
21:38:06 WHO IS GOING DO PAY FOR THAT IF THEY'RE NOT INSURED, NOT LICENSED.
IF WE GO AHEAD AND DO THE ZONING 
21:38:12 CHANGE AS MR. MORRIS SAID BRING IT BACK TO COUNCIL FOR -- IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE -- WE DON'T HAVE DO APPROVE EVERY 
21:38:15 LITTLE THING AND MAYBE IT DOESN'T HAVE TO COME BACK
TO COUNCIL.

21:38:21 MAYBE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT CAN BE DONE IN A STAFF BRIEFING, THIS IS AN OVERVIEW OF WHAT THAT MINISTERIAL 
21:38:26 PROCESS IS GOING TO LOOK LIKE AND GET THE INPUT FROM THERE.
THOSE ARE MY COMMENTS FOR NOW, THANK 
21:38:36 YOU.
>> City Manager Danaj:   WANT TO ADD TO WAYNE'S COMMENTS, THE PHRASE 
21:38:41 MINISTERIAL REVIEW DOESN'T MEAN IT'S A RUBBER  STAMP.
MINISTERIAL IS JUST A WORD OR PHRASE 
21:38:47 THAT WE USE MEANING IT DOESN'T HAVE TO GO BACK DOT PLANNING COMMISSION AND IT DOESN'T HAVE TO GO BACK TO YOU.

21:38:54 BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN IT'S NOT GOING TO BE A THOROUGH PROCESS, A MULTIDEPARTMENTAL PROCESS INCLUDING 
21:38:58 PUBLIC SAFETY.
IN MANY WAYS WE OPENED UP THE HOUSING NAVIGATION CENTER.

21:39:04 THIS COMMUNITY HAD VERY SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS ABOUT OPENING UP THE HOUSING NAVIGATION CENTER AND A LOT OF THE 
21:39:11 MINISTERIAL PROCESS WAS ALLOWED TO CITY STAFF, IT'S VERY THOROUGH VERY DETAILED AND IN THE

21:39:18 END THE HOUSING NAVIGATION CENTER NOT THAT THEY'RE EXACT COPIES, HAS TURNED OUT TO BE A VERY SUCCESSFUL 
21:39:24 OPERATIONAL FACILITY AND WITH ANY IF ALL OF THE NEGATIVITY THAT WE THOUGHT MIGHT COME FROM IT.

21:39:33 I WANTED TO UNDERSCORE FOR THE COMMUNITY MINISTERIAL DOESN'T MEAN IT'S NOT WITHOUT THOROUGH STAFF WHO 
21:39:39 FOCUSES ON THIS EVERY DAY.
>> Councilmember Jones:   WHILE I DO APPRECIATE THAT, I THINK IT'S 
21:39:45 IMPORTANT THAT SOME OF THE COUNCILMEMBERS CONCERNS GET ADDRESSED, WHAT ARE THE STEPS THAT PEOPLE ARE 
21:39:52 GOING TO HAVE TO GO THROUGH?
>> City Manager Danaj:   ABSOLUTELY, WE COULD DO THAT THROUGH COUNCIL 
21:40:00 BRIEFINGS.
>> THE CONTEXT CONTAINED WITHIN THE ZONING, I WANT TO CIRCLE BACK TO WHAT 
21:40:08 WAYNE HAD SAID EARLIER REGARDING THE LAND USE ISSUE THAT'S BEFORE YOU TONIGHT, THIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME THE 
21:40:15 CITY HAS ADOPTED
REGULATIONS, FOR FAITH BASED TEMPORARY SHELTERS AS WELL AS EMERGENCY SHELTERS 
21:40:20 WHICH ARE TWO DIFFERENT TYPES OF SHELTER OPPORTUNITIES THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO UNHOUSED RESIDENTS IN 
21:40:27 FREMONT BOTH OF WHICH
REQUIRE A MINISTERIAL PERMIT PROCESS VERY SIMILAR TO THE ONE THAT'S SET UP 
21:40:31 THROUGH THIS PROCESS.
AND JUST AS A MATTER OF COURSE, BECAUSE OF THE WAYS THAT SCREENING 
21:40:38 PROCESSES AND SERVICE PROVISION CHANGES, THAT AS PRACTICES CHANGE OVER THE YEARS, NEITHER OF THE EXISTING 
21:40:42 ORDINANCES CURRENTLY HAVE
THOSE SCREENING IMPLEMENTS WITHIN THE ZONING.

21:40:50 IT IS A MATTER THAT IS DEALT ADMINISTRATIVELY, BECAUSE THEY ARE THE EXPERTS IN THAT FIELD.

21:40:55 IF I COULD RECOMMEND THAT YOU KNOW I UNDERSTAND COUNCIL ANSWER INTEREST IN THE SCREENING PROCEDURES AND THE 
21:41:01 PROCESS AND BEING INVOLVED AND INFORMED ABOUT WHAT STAFF DECIDES IN TERMS OF A SCREENING

21:41:07 PROCESS.
I WOULD LIKE TO CAUTION THAT TYPICALLY THE APPROPRIATE PLACE FOR THAT IS NOT 
21:41:12 A LAND USE ORDINANCE.
IT IS THROUGH SOME SORT OF ADMINISTRATIVE REGULATION.

21:41:18 SHOULD COUNCIL WISH TO BE INVOLVED IN THAT PROCESS FURTHER MY RECOMMENDATION WOULD BE THAT IT'S ADDRESSED AS A 
21:41:23 SEPARATE KIND OF DOCUMENT OR ADMINISTRATIVE REGULATION, OR THROUGH BRIEFINGS, RATHER THAN

21:41:31 THROUGH CHANGES TO THE ORDINANCE BEFORE YOU TONIGHT.
>> Mayor Mei:   COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN 
21:41:36 YOU HAD WANTED TO SPEAK AT THIS TIME.
>> Councilmember Salwan:   THANK YOU MAYOR.

21:41:49 I THINK WAYNE AND COURTNEY HAVE EXPLAINED ZONING LAND USE DECISION.
AND SO WE'RE NOT NECESSARILY APPROVING 
21:41:53 ANY SPECIFICS ABOUT ANY PARTICULAR SITE OR  OPERATIONS.
I THINK THAT SETS THE CONTEXT.

21:41:59 I DO HEAR AT LEAST THREE OF MY COLLEAGUES WHO ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE OPERATIONS AND THERE ARE SOME 
21:42:06 UNANSWERED QUESTIONS.
SO -- AND WE HAVE A FEW OTHERS, I'D LIKE TO SEE WHAT THEY HAVE TO SAY TO 
21:42:14 SEE IF EITHER WE IS SHOULD BIFURCATE THIS, TO SEE IF WE HAVE THEIR SUPPORT TO PASS A ZONING ORDINANCE TODAY AND 
21:42:21 MAYBE BRING
BACK AN ITEM FOR DISCUSSION ON THE OPERATIONS AND ALL THE DIFFERENT 
21:42:30 CRITERIA THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED TODAY.
I PERSONALLY VIEW THIS AS KIND OF A FORCE MULTIPLIER, WE ALREADY HAVE 
21:42:35 FOLKS THAT ARE LIVING IN OUR COMMUNITY.
AND WE ALL NEED FAITH.

21:42:44 SO WHAT BETTER TO HELP IN THIS EFFORT THAN OUR FAITH ORGANIZATIONS TO HELP GIVE FAITH TO THOSE WHO MAY NOT HAVE 
21:42:47 ANY.
AND THEY'RE ALREADY HERE IN OUR COMMUNITY.

21:42:54 THEY WANT TO STEP UP.
THEY WANT TO HELP, LEVERAGING THE BENEFIT OF THE NONPROFITS, THE PUBLIC 
21:43:04 AND PRIVATE AND  NONPROFIT CONTRIBUTION WORKING TOGETHER.
AND CREATING A FRAMEWORK.

21:43:10 AND SO I THINK THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO ONE, TEST OUT THIS PROGRAM AND TO SEE HOW IT WORKS.

21:43:17 TO COURTNEY'S POINT I REMEMBER THERE WAS A TIME THAT WE USED TO ALLOW FOLKS TO SLEEP WITHIN THE CHURCHES.

21:43:22 I REMEMBER IT WAS SUCCESSFUL.
SO EVENTUALLY I DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS PHASED OUT OR WHAT HAPPENED BUT WE 
21:43:28 NEVER HAD ANY ISSUES.
SO I THINK THAT, YOU KNOW, THIS IS SOMETHING DEFINITELY WORTH EXPLORING.

21:43:36 IT REQUIRES MINIMAL CITY  EXPENSE.
IT'S A VOLUNTEER-LED EFFORT AND YOU KNOW WE CAN ALWAYS PULL THE PLUG IF 
21:43:42 THINGS DON'T WORK OUT.
SO I THINK THAT WE SHOULD TAKE THIS INITIATIVE, LET'S PUT IT TO GOOD FAITH 
21:43:49 AND SEE WHAT CAN COME OUT OF THIS.
SO IF THERE'S CONCERNS MAYBE WE BRING IT BACK FOR A FORMAL DISCUSSION 
21:43:54 LATER.
SO I'LL WAIT DO HEAR FROM THE OTHERS, SEE WHERE THE SUPPORT  IS, I THINK WE 
21:44:01 HAVEN'T HEARD FROM AT LEAST ONE COUNCILMEMBER, WE KIND OF KNOW WHERE EVERYBODY ELSE IS, AND THE MAYOR OF 
21:44:07  COURSE,
AND WE KIND OF DECIDE WHERE WE GO FROM HERE, THANK  YOU.

21:44:12 >> Mayor Mei:   COUNCILMEMBER COX DO YOU HAVE COMMENTS AT THIS TIME?
I STILL HAVE COMMENTS THE MAKE AS WELL 
21:44:21 AS COUNCILMEMBER KENG.
>> Councilmember Cox:   YES, I WAS GOING TO MENTION AS YOU WITH DEFINE 
21:44:28 PERFORMANCE STANDARDS AND SITE DESIGNS, THESE ARE THINGS YOU ARE IMPOSING AND IT'S A BIG MISS FOR US NOT TO HAVE THE 
21:44:33 SCREENING
LISTED EVEN DETAILING OUTS CAN PEOPLE EVEN SMOKE?

21:44:41 BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT MARIJUANA IS LEGAL HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THERE'S SOME THINGS HERE THAT I JUST 
21:44:50 DON'T THINK THAT THERE ARE ENOUGH AS DETAILS TO HAVE SOME SORT OF AREA OF COMFORT AND

21:44:56 MAINTAINING OUR SAFETY FOR OUR COMMUNITY.
ANOTHER PART IS THAT I'M CONCERNED 
21:45:05 ALSO ABOUT THE RESOURCES, EVEN THOUGH THAT IS USED BY VOLUNTEERS, BY THE  SITES, AND THE ORGANIZATIONS, THE HOST 
21:45:12 SITES, I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT ALSO THAT WE
CAN'T ASSUME THAT EVERY SINGLE CHURCH 
21:45:17 IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO SIGN UP.
BECAUSE A LOT HAS SUFFERED THROUGH THE PANDEMIC.

21:45:27 THEY'VE BEEN OUTPOURING OF OTHER TYPES OF LOVE, AND IT IS A FINANCIAL BURDEN IF YOU'RE  TALKING ABOUT $13,000 PLUS 
21:45:34 OTHER EXPENSES THAT MAY NOT BE AS WELL DEFINED AND OPERATING THIS TYPE OF PROGRAM,

21:45:42  AND IT WOULD BE INTERESTING TO HEAR FROM THE OTHER SITES THAT YOU VISITED IN SAN JOSE AND MOUNTAIN VIEW, WHAT IS 
21:45:49 SOME OF THEIR -- THOSE ARE THINGS THAT ARE ON TARGET, OR HAS IT BEEN MORE, THEY'VE HAD

21:45:59 MORE CARS, COMPARED TO THE SITE THAT WE'RE DOING IN THAT REGARD.
BUT I THINK THERE'S STILL SOME MORE 
21:46:08 THINGS TO BE HASHED OUT AND DISCUSSED TO ENSURE THAT THE RESIDENTS FEEL THAT WE HAVE DONE OUR FULL DUE DILIGENCE ON 
21:46:14 THIS TOPIC.
BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT ONCE WE CHANGE THE ORDINANCE, IT'S KIND OF HARD TO GO 
21:46:21 BACK AND UNDO IT ONCE IT'S ON THERE.
SO THAT'S MY OTHER CONCERN, TOO.
THAT THIS CHANGE COULD STAY ON THE 
21:46:29 BOOKS FOREVER.
AND WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR MAKING SURE THAT WE'VE DONE OUR DUE DILIGENCE.

21:46:37 SO THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei:   COUNCILMEMBER KENG.
>> Councilmember Keng:   THANK YOU, 
21:46:44 MADAM MAYOR.
SO I APPRECIATE EVERYONE'S COMMENTS AND FEEDBACK AND I DO LIKE TO SEE MORE 
21:46:53 CLARITY WITH THE PROGRAM, WITH THE SCREENING, AND I AS I AM NOT SURE WHAT THE CITY'S LIABILITY WOULD BE WHEN THE 
21:47:01 INDIVIDUALS
DO NOT CARRY CAR INSURANCE OR HAVE AN ACTIVE DRIVER'S LICENSE.

21:47:09 THE FACT THAT WE HAVEN'T REALLY REACHED OUT FOR THE COMMUNITY FOR FEEDBACK AND SUPPORT L, I THINK IT WOULD BE GREAT 
21:47:18 TO HAVE THAT BEFORE WE VOTE THE DRAFT ORDINANCE.
>> Mayor Mei:   SO I'M GOING TO CHIME 
21:47:25 IN NOW.
SO I WANTED PEOPLE TO KNOW I MEAN IT'S BEEN A LONG JOURNEY THAT WE'VE HAD 
21:47:35 THIS CONVERSATION AND IT'S ONE THAT I HAVE HAD THE FORTUNATE OR MISFORTUNATE OF SEEING FIRSTHAND WHERE IT CAME A 
21:47:40 POINT IN TIME
COUNT WHICH WE DIDN'T PARTICIPATE IN THIS YEAR, I PARTICIPATED IN THE LAST 
21:47:46 TWO.
WE'VE DEFINITELY SEEN AN INCREASE.
WHILE PEOPLE ARE SHOCKED TO HEAR THERE 
21:47:55 HAS BEEN AN INCREASE, IT IS CERTAINLY NOT UNIQUE TO FREMONT, IT'S NOT BECAUSE WE HAVE HAD THE NAVIGATION 
21:48:00 CENTER OR PARTICULARLY DIFFERENT IN FREMONT.
THE WARMING CENTER, TO EXPANDS IT WITH 
21:48:09 THE CLEAN START MOBILE HYGIENE CLINIC.
WE DID DO OUTREACH.
I'M A LITTLE FRUSTRATED WHEN I HEAR 
21:48:16 PEOPLE SAYING, WE NEVER DISCUSSED THIS PARKING.
WHEN WE ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS, IT SEEMS 
21:48:22 LIKE WE'VE HAD HOURS AND HOURS AND THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE PARTICIPATING ON THE HOUSING NAVIGATION CENTER, I KNOW 
21:48:26 THAT BECAUSE I HAD A CHANCE TO HAVE A FRONT SEAT
AT ALL OF THOSE.

21:48:33 IT IS NOT LIKE WE HAVEN'T HAD OUTREACH, THAT WE HAVEN'T REHASHED THIS.
WHAT WOULD BE SAD TO SAY AT TIMES WHEN 
21:48:39 I LOOK AT THIS SITUATION RIGHT NOW THAT WE'RE HEARING MUCH FOR THE HOUSING NAVIGATION CENTER I THINK EVERYBODY 
21:48:47  SAYS WE WANT TO DO SOMETHING BUT NOBODY
WANTS TO DO ANYTHING IF IT'S ANYWHERE 
21:48:52 NEAR THEM.
I CAN SEE IT RIGHT NOW FROM MY OFFICE AT THE CITY HALL BECAUSE PEOPLE SAID 
21:48:58 YOU KNOW IF YOU THINK IT'S SO GOOD IT'S SO GREAT THEN PUT IT WITH YOU.
AND I SAID YEAH, GO AHEAD.

21:49:07 IT CAN'T GET ANY CLOSER, IT'S RIGHT HERE AND I SEE IT EVERY SINGLE DAY.
I SEE IT IN THE MORNING WHEN I WALK.

21:49:13 >> AND SOMETIMES WHEN I LEAVE AT 11:00 AT NIGHT.
I FEEL IT'S REALLY HARD WHEN WE SEE 
21:49:19 THIS INCREASE, RIGHT NOW THERE ARE PEOPLE LIVING OUT THERE I WILL TELL YOU I'VE DRIVEN THROUGH THESE STREETS 
21:49:23 AND THROUGH THE ENCAMPMENTS AND THEY ARE ALREADY HERE.
IT IS NOT UNIQUE TO FREMONT.

21:49:30 IT IS NOT UNIQUE AND IT IS FRUSTRATING WHEN WE SEE IT IN PLACES LIKE ON THE MEDIANS OR ON THE SIDE OF THE ROADS.

21:49:36 THE HOMELESS ARE HERE AND THEY ARE PEOPLE RIGHT NOW AND IT IS HARDER FOR US TO MANAGE.

21:49:43 ONE OF THE THINGS IS IF WE DON'T GIVE ANY SORT OF SOLUTION OR ANY LOCATION FOR PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO UTILIZE IT, 
21:49:48 IN THE PAST WE'VE USED THE FAITH BASED GROUPS, I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS VIABLE.

21:49:57 WHAT I DID FOR MOTHER'S DAY JUST TO LET PEOPLE KNOW, I DROVE THROUGH THOSE PLACES, I DROVE THROUGH UNION CITY, 
21:50:02 MOUNTAIN VIEW, I WENT OUT TO TALK TO THE NEIGHBORS, ONE OF THE THINGS I PERSONALLY DID.

21:50:09 I DON'T JUST TALK ABOUT IT AND RESEARCH IT, I ACTUALLY GO  THERE.
AND IT'S VERY EMOTIONAL FOR ME TO SEE 
21:50:13 BECAUSE WHEN I TALK TO PEOPLE AND JUST LIKE THE HOUSING AND A HALF INSTIGATION CENTER AND BELIEVE ME I'M 
21:50:19 NOT INTERESTED IN JUST HAVING A SINGLE BULLET SOLUTION OR
JUST SOMETHING THAT'S JUST A PATCH.

21:50:26 WHEN I LOOK AT THE SOLUTIONS I LOOK AT IT BEING A BROADER BASED OPPORTUNITY.
EVERYTHING FROM GIVING THE SERVICES 
21:50:33 FOR BEING ABLE TO BE CLEAN SUCH AS CLEAN START AND HAVING CLEAN HYGIENE BECAUSE OF THIS COVID TIME PERIOD OR 
21:50:38 THIS PANDEMIC BECAUSE OF THE FACT THEY NEED TO BE CLEAN
TO APPLY FOR JOBS AND THEY NEED TO 
21:50:44 HAVE A PLACE OF RESIDENCE.
WE LOOKED AT THINGS WHEN WE TALKED ABOUT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT TO GET 
21:50:52 COHORTS OF PEOPLE TOGETHER TO GET TO THESE JOBS TO THESE TRAININGS SO THEY CAN GET OUT OF THIS SITUATION THESE 
21:50:57 WRAP AROUND SERVICES
THAT THEY NEED.
THIS IS A STEP, I KNOW COUNCILMEMBER 
21:51:04 SHAO CAN RELATE DO THIS HAVING BEEN ON SCHOOL  BOARD, THERE ARE THINGS LIKE BOARD POLICIES AND THE ADMINISTRATIVE 
21:51:07 REGULATION IN TERMS OF HOW YOU ACTUALLY
CREATE THE PROGRAM THROUGH HEALTH AND 
21:51:11 HUMAN SERVICES.
AND THOSE WOULD BE THOSE REQUIREMENTS WE TALK ABOUT SUCH AS SCREENING, 
21:51:17 POLICE, FIRE AND THOSE OTHER PIECES.
SO IT WOULD BE A COMPLETE PICTURE.
IT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT WE'RE LOOKING 
21:51:22 AT.
I FEAR THAT ULTIMATELY WHAT I KEEP HEARING FROM PEOPLE THIS EVENING IS I 
21:51:29 THINK EVERYBODY WOULD LIKE TO PUT IT AT A LOCATION BUT A LOCATION WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS BEFORE AND WE'VE HAD 
21:51:33 INTENSE
CONVERSATIONS WHEN WE LOOKED AT A MAP OF THE CITY'S PROPERTIES.

21:51:39 IN THE END IT WAS ANY PROPERTY OTHER THAN THE PROPERTY NEAR US.
I JUST WORRY THAT I THINK THAT THIS IS 
21:51:46 A VIABLE SOLUTION.
WHEN I VISITED THE ONES IN MOUNTAIN VIEW THEY RANGED IN SIZE SUCH AS THE 
21:51:56 VTA ONE YOU TOLD US ABOUT, THERE WAS SOLAR, SOME GENTLEMAN TAUGHT PEACH TO USE SOLAR, IT WAS VERY QUIET, I WENT 
21:52:02 THROUGH
THERE, I'VE BEEN THERE IN DAYTIME AND IN NIGHTTIME AND TO LOOK AT THAT AND 
21:52:08 MOST PEOPLE JUST WANT TO HAVE DIGNITY AND BE ABLE TO GIVE SUPPORT SO THEY CAN BE ABLE TO LIVE.

21:52:15 SOME OF THE ONES THAT WERE FAITH BASED THAT I WENT TO THAT WERE SMALLER HOUSED ANYTHING FROM FIVE TO TEN CARS, 
21:52:20 IT WASN'T AS BIG.
IT GAVE THEM A PLACE.
RIGHT NOW IF YOU DRIVE THROUGH OUR 
21:52:27 CITY AND ANY OTHER CITY RIGHT NOW IN THE BAY AREA THERE ARE RVS THAT ARE THERE AND I KNOW ABOUT THIS BECAUSE 
21:52:31 I'VE DRIVEN THROUGH THE INDUSTRIAL AREAS TOO AND YES
I'VE SEEN AND WE'VE HAD CONVERSATION 
21:52:39 WITH PEOPLE WHO SAY WE ARE INHUMANE BECAUSE OF OUR BOULDERS AND WHATNOT.
I RECOGNIZE SOME OF THEM ARE MOVABLE 
21:52:44 VEHICLES.
IF ITS WERE ME AND WE HAVE THIS COMPLETE PROGRAM, WE HAVE STUDENTS 
21:52:49 FROM ROP WHERE WE COULD DO AUTOMOTIVE AND THEY FIX THE CARS.
IT WOULD INCLUDE PROGRAMS WHERE WE 
21:52:57 HAVE SKILLS, WE HAVE SO MANY SOLAR MANUFACTURERS AND TO BE ABLE TO HAVE SOME OF THOSE JOBS TRAINING AND HAVE 
21:53:01 SOLAR TRAINING TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THAT VERSUS JUST
PROPANE.

21:53:07 THERE WOULD BE SOMETHING I WOULD IDEALLY LIKE TO SEE.
BUT WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FOR NO 
21:53:14 TONIGHT'S AGENDA ITEM IS STRICTLY THE ORDINANCE TO LOOK AT THE POSSIBILITY OF LAND USE FOR CHURCH PARKING LOTS.

21:53:22 JUST TO LET YOU KNOW IN CASE OF A NATURAL DISASTER MANY OF THEM OUR SCHOOLS AND OUR CHURCHES ARE AVAILABLE 
21:53:25 FOR EMERGENCY.
THAT'S WHAT WE'VE DICTATED IN THE PAST.

21:53:31 THOSE WILL BE THE PLACES MANY PEOPLE WILL BE GOING TO AND THIS IS AN EMERGENCY AT THIS POINT, THIS IS AN 
21:53:37 EMERGENCY WHERE WE SEE A NEED IN OUR COMMUNITY.
WE CAN'T ASK PEOPLE, YOU CANNOT ASK 
21:53:42 PEOPLE TO BE NOT ON THE STREET IN FRONTS OF YOU IF YOU DON'T GIVE THEM A PLACE OR LOCATION ALTERNATIVE.

21:53:48 THAT IS WHAT I'M ASKING YOU TO LOOK AT TODAY IS ONLY THAT, THE PERMISSION FOR US TO GO AHEAD AND PROCEED WITH THE 
21:53:54 DISCUSSION OF LAND USE.
WHEN IT COMES TO THE PROGRAMS AND THE PERMITTING IF WE WANTS DO AND I WOULD 
21:54:04  WANT  TO, I UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS, I AM SADDENED TO SEE THAT I MEAN I THINK THAT THE INCIDENT THAT HAPPENED IN 
21:54:08 OUR
CITY WAS HORRIFIC.
IT WAS DEMEANING, IT WAS HORRIBLE.

21:54:14 BUT I WOULD NOT SAY THAT EVERY HOMELESS PERSON IS LIKE THAT.
AND THAT'S THE THING THAT IS 
21:54:18 HEARTBREAKING FOR ME.
WHEN I THINK ABOUT THE PEOPLE THAT I'VE MET THROUGH THE LAST COUPLE YEARS 
21:54:27 OF MY -- I MEAN FOR MANY YEARS SINCE I WAS A CHILD BUT MORE SO HERE IN THIS LAST YEAR AND A HALF AND I'VE BEEN IN 
21:54:33 THE PANDEMIC
AND HERE IN THE OFFICE EVERY DAY.
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE HELPING EACH OTHER, 
21:54:40 HELPING EACH OTHER FIX UP THEIR BICYCLES SO THEY CAN GET DO WORK ARE NOT THE HORRIBLE PEOPLE THAT I'M 
21:54:44 HEARING ABOUT NOW.
SO IT IS HEARTBREAKING.
WHAT YOU'RE SEEING IN THAT SITUATION, 
21:54:50 NOT JUST THAT SITUATION BUT MANY SITUATIONS IS MENTAL HEALTH AND THAT IS ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT WE NEED TO 
21:54:56 FACE HEAD ON AS A CITY BUT TO SAY MANY HOMELESS SPERN
IN THAT SITUATION, MANY ARE NOT BUT 
21:55:00 THERE ARE MANY IN NEED OF MENTAL HEALTH WHO ARE HOME BOUND, STUDENTS AND OTHERS.

21:55:06 SO I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE THE MOTION AND I'LL MAKE ITS MYSELF TO GO AHEAD WITH THIS VOTE ON THIS ORDINANCE.

21:55:13 AND IT WAS STRICTLY FOR THE ORDINANCE AND I WANT DOAD CLARIFY IT AGAIN, IT IS FOR THE LAND USE.

21:55:19 IT IS NOT FOR THE PROGRAM, IT IS NOT FOR SAFE PARKING RIGHT NOW TODAY.
IT IS STRICTLY FOR THE OPTION THAT IF 
21:55:26 WE WANTED TO, DO HAVE FAITH BASED DO BE ABLE TO UTILIZE THEIR PARKING LOTS IN A PREAM SHOULD WE PROCEED AND GO 
21:55:35  PROGRAM SHOULD WE WANT TO PROCEED WITH THAT,
 AS A PROGRAM THROUGH HEALTH AND HUMAN 
21:55:39 SERVICES.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT CITY MANAGER WOULD LIKE TO SAY OR ADD ONTO THIS AS WELL 
21:55:47 AS OUR CITY ATTORNEY.
>> Councilmember Kassan:   I'LL SECOND.

21:55:57 >> Mayor Mei:   SO I HAVE A MOTION.
>> Councilmember Jones:   MADAM MAYOR.

21:56:01 >> Mayor Mei:   COUNCILMEMBER JONES.
>> Councilmember Jones:   COULD I SUGGEST A FRIENDLY AMENDMENT?

21:56:04 >> Mayor Mei:   SURE.
>> Councilmember Jones:   ONE OF MY CONCERNS WAS THE ORDINANCE DOES 
21:56:13 INCLUDE HOST SITE  STANDARDS.
AND MAYBE MS. MARGOLIS YOU COULD COME UP WITH THE PROPER WORDING BUT YOU 
21:56:18 KNOW IT LISTS A NUMBER OF REQUIREMENTS.
AND I DON'T SEIZE THE CAVEAT ABOUT AND 
21:56:29 OTHER CONDITIONS AS DEEMED NECESSARY.
IF THAT MIGHT BE ADDED IN THERE AND THAT GIVES US A LITTLE MORE CONTROL 
21:56:35 OVER WHAT GOES ON AND THEN I'D ALSO LIKE TO SEE THE OPERATIONS PLAN BROUGHT BACK NOT NECESSARILY TO A 
21:56:40 COUNCIL  MEETING,
UNLESS THAT'S WHAT THE OTHERS WOULD LIKE, AT LEAST IN A STAFF BRIEFING SO 
21:56:46 WE ARE ALL AWARE AND COMFORTABLE WITH THE SITUATION GOING FORWARD.
>> Mayor Mei:   I'M OKAY WITH BRINGING 
21:56:52 IT BACK TO THE COUNCIL MEETING BECAUSE I THINK THE PUBLIC WANTS TO BE PART OF IT AND WE CIRCULATE HAVE THAT 
21:56:57 DISCUSSION AND CONVERSATION.
I'M OKAY WITH THE OPERATIONS PART OF IT BEING BROUGHT BACK BUT THIS IS 
21:57:06 STRICTLY FOR THE LAND USE.
>> City Manager Danaj:   I'M HAPPY TO BRING BACK THE BROADER OPERATIONAL 
21:57:11 PLAN AND WHEN WE'RE PERHAPS IMPLEMENTING OUR FIRST OPPORTUNITY.
>> Mayor Mei:   I THINK THAT IS GREAT 
21:57:17 OPPORTUNITY TO DO WHAT MANY HAVE ASKED FOR TONIGHT, TO DO A PILOT AND A SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION.

21:57:26 BUT TO NOT MOVE AT ALL I THINK WOULD BE A STEP BACKWARD AND IT WOULD BE TO CONTINUE I'M  TREADING WATER AND I 
21:57:31 FEEL LIKE DROWNING.
>> Councilmember Jones:   IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO INCLUDE THAT AS PART OF THE 
21:57:36 MOTION, OR I CAN MAKE THE AMENDMENT.
>> Mayor Mei:   THAT'S FINE.
>> Councilmember Jones:   I'LL AMEND 
21:57:43 IT TO SAY THE OPERATIONS PLAN COMES BACK TO US HOPEFULLY IN THE VERY NEAR FUTURE OR AS THE CITY MANAGER SAID 
21:57:47 ONCE, WEEP HAVE SOMEONE WHO IS ACTUALLY GOING TO
PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM.

21:57:54 I'M SORRY DEBRA.
>> COUNCILMEMBER JONES ARE YOU ALSO ASKING THAT THE AMENDMENT BE ADDED TO 
21:57:59 ADD THAT LANGUAGE THAT SAYS SOMETHING ABOUT OTHER STANDARDS AS DEEMED NECESSARY?

21:58:10 >> Councilmember Jones:   YES, I THINK THAT W WOULD BE APPROPRIATE?
THAT SEEMS LIKE KIND OF A BROAD 
21:58:14 STATEMENT.
THERE IS SOMETHING AT THE END OF THAT LIST THAT SAYS OTHER CONDITIONS AS 
21:58:17 NECESSARY.
>> Mayor Mei:   AND FOR COUNCIL REVIEW OF THE PROGRAM.

21:58:29 >> I DON'T WANT TO STEP ON THE CITY ATTORNEY'S'S SHOES BUT WOULD I LIKE TO ADD FROM A ZONING PERSPECTIVE, FROM 
21:58:36 PERFORMANCE STANDARDS WAS EXPLICITLY TO CREATE OBJECTIVE STANDARDS SO WE WOULD HAVE A

21:58:44 BASIS FOR FUTURE MINISTERIAL REVIEW, AND EXEMPTS FROM CEQA UNDER STATE LAW.

21:58:51 THAT WAS OUR MOTIVATION FOR NOT HAVING AN OPEN ENDED CONDITION THAT WE COULD ADD ONTO IT.

21:58:56 I WILL TURN IT OVER TO THE CITY ATTORNEY TO ADD ONTO THAT.
AND HER THOUGHTS ON WHETHER OR NOT 
21:59:04 THAT WOULD BE POSSIBLE WHILE KEEPING IT AS A MINISTERIAL PROCESS.
>> I THINK KEEPING THE STANDARDS AS 
21:59:15 OBJECTIVE AS POSSIBLE IS BENEFICIAL.
SO I WOULD PROBABLY RECOMMEND NOT INCLUDING THAT OPEN-ENDED LANGUAGE BUT 
21:59:20 WE'LL BRING BACK THE OPERATIONAL STANDARDS AND YOU'LL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE SURE EVERYTHING 
21:59:23 YOU THINK
NEEDS TO BE COVERED IS COVERED.
>> Councilmember Jones:   YES, THAT 
21:59:28 WORKS, THANK YOU.
>> SO THEN YOUR AMENDMENT IS SIMPLY TO BRING BACK THE OPERATIONAL STANDARDS 
21:59:34 WITH THE FIRST PILOT PROGRAM.
>> Councilmember Jones:   CORRECT.
>> I WOULDN'T USE THE TERM OPERATIONAL 
21:59:39 STANDARDS BECAUSE THAT SOUNDS LIKE THE STANDARDS IN THE ZONING ORDINANCE.
I DESTINY WHAT WE WOULD WANT TO BRING 
21:59:47 BACK IS THE DETAILS IN THE PROGRAM AND HOW THE CITY PARTICIPATES IN IT.
>> OKAY SO MORE PROGRAMMATIC 
21:59:52 STANDARDS.
>> Councilmember Kassan:    RIGHT.
>> Mayor Mei:   AS WELL AS PERFORMANCE 
21:59:58 AND SAFETY.
>> City Manager Danaj:   I  AGREE, I THINK THOSE ARE BETTER WORDS.

22:00:03 >> OKAY.
>> Councilmember Jones:   I HOPE SOMEBODY WROTE THAT DOWN.

22:00:07 >> DO YOU ACCEPT THAT  AMENDMENTS?
>> Mayor Mei:   I DO.
SO I MADE THE MOTION.

22:00:16 AND IT WAS SECONDED BY C COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN AND MODIFIED AND AMENDED BY COUNCILMEMBER JONES.

22:00:21 PLEASE MAY I HAVE A VOTE.

22:02:29 HAD YOU SPEAKING FOR THIS AGENDA ITEM 8A?
ARE YOU SPEAKING FOR ITEM 8A?

22:02:35 >> HELLO?
>> Mayor Mei:   HI MISTY, ARE YOU SPEAKING FOR YIRT 8A?

22:02:40 >> I JUST WANTED HAVE A QUESTION I WANTED TO ASK YOU.
WHEN YOU TALK TO THE HOMELESS PEOPLE 
22:02:48 DO YOU THINK THE REASON WHY THEY BECOME --
>> Mayor Mei:   MY APOLOGIES, MISTY.

22:02:55 THAT ITEM IS NO LONGER ON THE TABLE SO THAT'S ALREADY BEEN VOTED ON THIS EVENING BUT YOU CAN REACH OUT TO US 
22:03:02 SEPARATELY.
SO I APOLOGIZE ON THAT.
SEEING NO OTHER AGENDA ITEMS THIS 
22:03:08 EVENING --
>> Councilmember Kassan:   CAN I GIVE JUST A REALLY QUICK ONE SENTENCE 
22:03:11 REPORT?
>> Mayor Mei:   SURE.
>> Councilmember Kassan:   I'M ON THE 
22:03:23 STOP WASTE BODY AND THERE IS SOMETHING CALLED THE SB 13 AB 3, 1383, YEAH, WHICH HAS TO DO WITH -- YEAH IT HAS TO 
22:03:30 DO WITH ORGANIC RECYCLING AND DIVERTING FOOD
WASTE AND IT'S GOING TO HAVE A PRETTY 
22:03:35 BIG IMPACT ON ALL THE JURISDICTIONS IN THE STATE.
AND WE'RE GOING TO BE ADOPTING A LOCAL 
22:03:41 ORDINANCE TO IMPLEMENT IT.
AND THE TIME TO MAKE COMMENTS ON THAT IS REALLY NOW.

22:03:50 SO IF ANYONE IS INTERESTED IN PARTICIPATING IN THAT PROCESS OF HOW WE'RE GOING TO DIVERT MORE ORGANIC 
22:03:58 WASTE FROM THE LANDFILL, AND SAVE MORE EDIBLE FOOD FROM GOING TO THE LANDFILL, PLEASE LOOK INTO SB

22:04:03 1383.
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU FOR SHARING THAT REPORT.

22:04:11 I ALSO WAS GOING TO MENTION THAT WE HAVE SOME GREAT INNOVATION MANUFACTURERS HERE LOCALLY IN FREMONT 
22:04:18 ON THAT SO IF YOU EVER WANTED TO LOOK AT THAT THERE IS A COMPANY CALLED POWER KNOT IN WARM SPRINGS,

22:04:24 WE WERE ALSO ABLE TO HEAR WITH EAST BAY EDA WENT WITH OUR ECONOMIC DISCUSSION THIS YEAR.

22:04:30 WE HAD A PROFILE DISCUSSION ON RESTAURANTS AND FOOD WASTE AND THE FUTURE OF FOOD SO THAT WAS ONE OF THE 
22:04:37 CONVERSATIONS WE HAD IS HOW WE WERE GOING TO ADDRESS THAT.
I'M GOING TO MENTION TOMORROW THERE IS 
22:04:43 A LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES, WE'VE HAD SOME EXCITING THINGS AS FAR AS MAKING INROADS ON AFFORDABLE HOUSING 
22:04:49 AND SOME GROUND BREAKINGS.
I KNOW THERE'S A DISCUSSION, TOMORROW, A COUPLE OF CONVERSATIONS COMING UP 
22:04:55 ONE IS A POSSIBLE CLAW BACK FOR FUNDING FOR THE CITIES AND STATE SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I HAVE MADE SURE THAT 
22:05:00 WE HAVE
SUBMITTED A LETTER OPPOSING ANY CLAW BACK ON FUNDING FOR THE CITY.

22:05:08 BECAUSE WE DO NEED THE FUNDS.
AND THEN THE OTHER ONE IS WE'VE BEEN DOING A LOT OF PLEANCH  OUTREACH AND 
22:05:13 THERE IS A POSSIBILITY TOMORROW TO TALK ABOUT THERE'S A DISCUSSION FORUM WITH ALAMEDA COUNTY WATER DISTRICT AND IF

22:05:19 ANYBODY'S INTERESTED IN THAT FROM OUR COUNCIL THAT WOULD BE TOMORROW.
THERE'S TWO DISCUSSIONS, ONE'S A LOCAL 
22:05:31 FOCUS WITH ALAMEDA COUNTY WATER DISTRICT, CONTRA COSTA EAST BAY MUD, HELD THROUGH CALIFORNIA CITIES, AND AN 
22:05:36 EARLIER DISCUSSION AT 10:00 WITH SECRETARY WADE.
AND I ALSO WANTED TO JUST BRIEFLY 
22:05:45 SHARE THAT I HAVE TO THANK HANS FOR HIS PARTICIPATION TODAY.
WE HAD A CHANCE TO TALK ABOUT THE 
22:05:52 GOVERNOR'S IMPACT ON THE BUDGET, HANS AND I HAD A CALL EARLIER TODAY WITH SECRETARY KIM, THE TRANSPORTATION 
22:05:56 SECRETARY DAVID KIM AND TO TALK ABOUT DIFFERENT PROJECTS
THAT WE'RE TRYING TO PUT BEFORE THE 
22:06:05 STATE AND I APPRECIATE THE LETTER AND THE FEEDBACK FROM THE DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS, HOUSING OR TRANSPORTATION 
22:06:11 OR OTHER  AREAS.
I THINK THAT'S IT FOR THIS EVENING.
THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR TIME THANK YOU 
22:06:17 FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND THANK YOU ALL FOR JOINING IN, THANK YOU SUSAN FOR YOUR HELP SO I WANTED TO WISH YOU ALL A
