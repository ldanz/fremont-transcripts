COORDINATION ALWAYS, WHICH I'VE

 AND
TO ECHO THE COMMENTS OF YOUR
COLLEAGUES, AND

[Captioner] 19:27:17
 NO

[Captioner] 19:27:21
 BETTER
CONGRATULATORY REMARKS THAN
THOSE OF

[Captioner] 19:27:24
 YOUR COLLEAGUES, AN
OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN, AN


[Captioner] 19:27:27
AMBASSADOR FOR FREMONT, A KIND
SOUL, A

[Captioner] 19:27:41
 VISIBLE IN

WITH YOU.
LET ME JUST

[Captioner] 19:27:51
 ALSO SAY WHAT A
MODEL CITIZEN YOU ARE

[Captioner] 19:27:54
 AND
FREMONT IS LUCKY TO HAVE

[Captioner] 19:27:57

MENTIONED BY MAYOR

[Captioner] 19:28:00
 MEI AND
PREPARED BY YOUR WONDERFUL
STAFF,

[Captioner] 19:28:03
 I HAVE TO SAY, I ECHO ALL
OF THEM, BUT LET ME JUST ADD


[Captioner] 19:28:08
THAT I KNOW YOU LEAVE A LEGACY
IN FREMONT BY SOME OF

[Captioner] 19:28:12
 THE
ACTIONS THAT YOU

[Captioner] 19:28:15
 UNDERTOOK.
ADDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING STOCK.
AND YOU CAN LOOK

[Captioner] 19:28:19
 AROUND THE CITY
AND SEE IT, AND IT'S BECAUSE OF
YOUR COURAGEOUSNESS AND

[Captioner] 19:28:23
 YOU
UNDERSTAND HOW TO TRULY MAKE
AFFORDABLE HOUSING, AND

[Captioner] 19:28:26
 IT
REQUIRES MARKET RATE HOUSING TO
GO ALONG WITH IT AND YOU MADE


[Captioner] 19:28:29
SOME TOUGH DECISIONS TO DO THAT.
I APPLAUD YOU.


[Captioner] 19:28:33

[Captioner] 19:28:55
 THAT I

ALSO

[Captioner] 19:28:58

INSTRUCTOR AND A GIRLS SOFTBALL


[Captioner] 19:29:09

MIDDLE OF SWEARING SOMEONE IN
BUT

[Captioner] 19:30:22
 HE WANTED TO TAKE A MOMENT
TO RECOGNIZE COUNCILMEMBER JONES
AND FOR

[Captioner] 19:30:25
 HIS YEARS OF DEDICATED
SERVICE TO OUR COMMUNITY.
I WANTED TO

[Captioner] 19:30:27
 SHARE A PERSONAL
ANECDOTE.
HE PROBABLY DOESN'T REMEMBER


[Captioner] 19:30:31
THIS, BUT IT WAS THE FIRST TIME
I MET COUNCILMEMBER JONES AND IT


[Captioner] 19:30:34
WAS AT THE STOP VISION HATE
RALLY IN FREMONT THAT WAS EMCEED


[Captioner] 19:30:37
BY COUNCILMEMBER SHAO.
THERE WAS A SENIOR WHO JUST GOT


[Captioner] 19:30:40
PEPPER SPRAYED TO PROTECT
HERSELF AND SHE DIDN'T KNOW HOW
TO

[Captioner] 19:30:43
 USE IT, AND HE JUST QUIETLY
BROUGHT HER ASIDE AND
DEMONSTRATED TO HER HOW

[Captioner] 19:30:46
 TO USE
IT.
I THINK THAT REALLY EX-EMILY


[Captioner] 19:30:53
 EXEMPLIFIES
WHO HE IS.

FOCUSED AND ON THE RIGHT TRACK
SO THAT ULTIMATELY THEY WERE
ABLE TO LEAD

[Captioner] 19:33:20

WITH TIME ON THE PLANNING
COMMISSION AND THEN HE JOINED

THE CITY COUNCIL, WHERE FOR
EIGHT YEARS, HE'S ALWAYS COME

[Captioner] 19:35:28
 IN ATTENDING EVERY

[Captioner] 19:35:35
 WITH THAT, I'D LIKE TO START
BY THANKING OUR RESIDENTS FOR
ALLOWING ME

[Captioner] 19:35:37

EIGHT YEARS.


[Captioner] 19:35:41

[Captioner] 19:35:45
 AMAZING PEOPLE
AT ALL THE EVENTS THAT MY WIFE
AND I HAVE ATTENDED AND I'M


[Captioner] 19:35:47
CONTINUALLY IMPRESSED BY THEIR
DEDICATION TO MAKING OUR
COMMUNITY BETTER.


[Captioner] 19:35:51
WE HAVE AN INCREDIBLE NETWORK OF
NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS

[Captioner] 19:35:54

PROVIDING SERVICES TO OUR
UNHOUSED

[Captioner] 19:35:57
 POPULATION, SENIORS,
YOUNG PEOPLE, PEOPLE WITH
SPECIAL NEEDS,

[Captioner] 19:36:01
 VICTIMS OF
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, AND SO MANY
OTHERS IN NEED.


[Captioner] 19:36:05
THEY ALSO HOST COMMUNITY EVENTS
SUCH AS THE FESTIVAL OF THE

 OUR AGE WELL
CENTER, AND WITH HUMAN SERVICES,
THE

[Captioner] 19:36:24
 RECREATION DEPARTMENT, THE

DEPARTMENT.


[Captioner] 19:36:27

OF SERVICES AND ACTIVITIES THAT
WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO OFFER.


[Captioner] 19:36:35
SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR DEDICATION

[Captioner] 19:36:38
WE HAVE AN INCREDIBLY DIVERSE
COMMUNITY,

[Captioner] 19:36:41
 AND ONE OF THE -- I
ALWAYS TELL PEOPLE ONE OF THE
BENEFITS OF THIS POSITION IS


[Captioner] 19:36:44
THAT I HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF
MEETING PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER THE


[Captioner] 19:36:47
WORLD, AND I GET TO LEARN ABOUT
THEIR CULTURES, AND I GET TO

[Captioner] 19:36:50
 EAT
THEIR FOOD.
SO I DON'T KNOW OF ANY OTHER JOB


[Captioner] 19:36:53
WHERE YOU HAVE THAT PERK.


[Captioner] 19:36:56
I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO THANK OUR

[Captioner] 19:37:02

PROGRAMS AND POLICIES.
I MEAN, WHEN I FIRST

[Captioner] 19:37:36
 STARTED,
FORMER CITY MANAGER FRED DIAZ
SAID, YOU KNOW,

[Captioner] 19:37:39
 THE AMOUNT OF
INFORMATION YOU NEED TO DIGEST
IS LIKE DRINKING WATER

[Captioner] 19:37:41
 THROUGH A
FIRE HOSE.
AND HE WAS RIGHT.


[Captioner] 19:37:45
SO -- BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF
STAFF WHO HAVE TAKEN TIME

>> Mayor Mei: AND AT THIS

[Captioner] 19:50:00
 TIME,
I'D LIKE TO INVITE


[Captioner] 19:50:03
DISTRICT 3 COUNCILMEMBER ELECT
JENNY KASSAN AND

[Captioner] 19:50:06
 HER HUSBAND
VINNIE

[Captioner] 19:50:13
 BACON TO THE PODIUM FOR
SWEARING

[Captioner] 19:50:20
 IN.


[Captioner] 19:50:25
I'D LIKE TO BE

[Captioner] 19:50:28
 THE FIRST TO SAY
CONGRATULATIONS TO OUR NEW
COUNCILMEMBER.


[Captioner] 19:50:31
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
ALLOWING ME.


[Captioner] 19:50:34
I'LL TRY TO BE BRIEF

[Captioner] 19:50:37
 BUT I HAVE
A FEW THINGS TO SAY ABOUT JENNY.
IT'S

[Captioner] 19:50:40
 FUNNY, WHEN JENNY FIRST RAN
ABOUT 4 1/2 YEARS

[Captioner] 19:50:43
 AGO, EVERYONE
SAID, WELL, SHE WON'T KNOW WHAT
TO SAY,

[Captioner] 19:50:46
 SHE'LL JUST HAVE TO
TAKE -- SAY WHAT

[Captioner] 19:50:49
 VINNIE SAYS.
I WAS LIKE, WELL, YOU DON'T KNOW
JENNY VERY WELL.


[Captioner] 19:50:53
JENNY IS PERFECTLY CAPABLE OF
SPEAKING ON HER

[Captioner] 19:50:56
 OWN.
AND THEN PEOPLE STARTED -- SOME


[Captioner] 19:50:59
OF MY FRIENDS, THEY WERE ALL
LIKE, WELL, JENNY IS ACTUALLY


[Captioner] 19:51:02
MORE QUALIFIED THAN VINNIE TO
SERVE ON THE

[Captioner] 19:51:05
 FREMONT CITY
COUNCIL.
AND PEOPLE WOULD ASK ME, IS THAT


[Captioner] 19:51:08
REALLY TRUE?


[Captioner] 19:51:11
AND IT WAS ACTUALLY SIX YEARS
AGO, RIGHT AT THIS VERY

[Captioner] 19:51:14
 SPOT
WHERE JENNY EMBARRASSED ME BY
TELLING A STORY ABOUT WHEN WE


[Captioner] 19:51:18
DATED, WE MET BECAUSE WE WERE


[Captioner] 19:51:21
BOTH INTERESTED IN CITY PLANNING
AT U.C. BERKELEY AND THAT WAS
INDEED

[Captioner] 19:51:24
 HOW WE BONDED.
BUT I REMEMBER PUTTING

[Captioner] 19:51:28
 UP --
HELPING WITH HER WEBSITE AND
PUTTING A BIO ON THE WEBSITE AND


[Captioner] 19:51:31
I WAS LIKE, MY GOD, THIS IS
QUITE

[Captioner] 19:51:34
 AN INCREDIBLE BIO AND I
MARRIED YOU AND I DON'T THINK
THERE IS

[Captioner] 19:51:38
 ANOTHER COUNCILPERSON
AT LEAST IN ALL ALAMEDA COUNTY
THAT

[Captioner] 19:51:41
 HAS MORE RELEVANT EDUCATION
AND EXPERIENCE THAN JENNY.


[Captioner] 19:51:45
PEOPLE ALL TALK ABOUT, OH, WE
LIKE, YOU KNOW,

[Captioner] 19:51:47
 TRANSIT-ORIENTED
DEVELOPMENT.
JENNY HAS BEEN IN THE TRENCHES


[Captioner] 19:51:51
THERE DOING IT.
EVERYONE SAYS OH, WE NEED TO
HELP OUR BUSINESSES

[Captioner] 19:51:54
 AND CREATE
MORE GOOD BUSINESS

[Captioner] 19:51:57
 MARKETPLACES.
JENNY'S DONE THAT TOO.


[Captioner] 19:52:00
ANYWAY, BUT MORE IMPORTANT THAN
ALL THE TECHNICAL EXPERTISE

[Captioner] 19:52:04
 THAT
JENNY BRINGS IS HER IMPECCABLE


[Captioner] 19:52:07
INTEGRITY.
UNLIKE MOST OF US, MYSELF


[Captioner] 19:52:10
INCLUDED, JENNY IS NOT
INTERESTED IN CLIMBING THE


[Captioner] 19:52:13
POLITICAL LADDER.
SHE IS NOT INTERESTED IN, YOU


[Captioner] 19:52:17
KNOW, DO -- GETTING ALONG JUST
TO TRY TO ADVANCE

[Captioner] 19:52:20
 HER POLITICAL
CAREER.
SHE'S NOT

[Captioner] 19:52:23
 CONCERNED ABOUT
OFFENDING CERTAIN

[Captioner] 19:52:26
 POLITICAL
INTERESTS, SHE'LL SIMPLY TELL
WHAT'S ON HER MIND.


[Captioner] 19:52:29
SHE'S NOT OFFENDING THOSE WITH
DEEP POCKETS THAT MIGHT HELP HER


[Captioner] 19:52:33
IN FUTURE OFFICE.
JENNY IS ONLY CONCERNED ABOUT
WHAT DOING WHAT IS RIGHT FOR

[Captioner] 19:52:36
 THE
RESIDENTS OF FREMONT.
AND SHE WILL

[Captioner] 19:52:38
 ONLY MAKE -- SHE
WILL MAKE DECISIONS ONLY BASED
ON THAT.


[Captioner] 19:52:42
AND I THINK THAT IS ONE OF THE
THINGS THAT MAKES HER SUCH AN
EXCELLENT

[Captioner] 19:52:45
 COUNCILMEMBER.
INDEED, SEEING

[Captioner] 19:52:49
 HER ON THE LAST
FOUR YEARS, SHE HAS DONE AN
AMAZING JOB ON THE

[Captioner] 19:52:52
 COUNCIL, AND
I'M SURE SHE'S GOING TO DO AN
EVEN MORE AMAZING

[Captioner] 19:52:55
 JOB IN HER
NEXT THREE YEARS.
AND I FEEL SO INCREDIBLY LUCKY


[Captioner] 19:52:59
TO BE ABLE TO SAY THAT YOU ARE
MY WIFE.


[Captioner] 19:53:03
ANYWAY, LET'S GET ON TO
BUSINESS.


[Captioner] 19:53:08
I -- RAISE YOUR RIGHT HAND AND
REPEAT AFTER ME.


[Captioner] 19:53:11
I, STATE YOUR NAME.

[Captioner] 19:53:15
 SOLEMNLY SWEAR OR AFFIRM

ALSO MY

[Captioner] 20:00:15
 FAMILY.
JUST A WEEK AGO, I

[Captioner] 20:00:19
 CELEBRATED
THE 30TH ANNIVERSARY OF ME
GETTING BAPTIZED,

[Captioner] 20:00:22
 AND TODAY, OF
COURSE, WILL ALSO

[Captioner] 20:00:25
 SIGNIFY A NEW
CHAPTER IN MY

[Captioner] 20:00:30
 LIFE.
RUNNING AS AN INCUMBENT FOR

[Captioner] 20:00:32
 THE
RE-ELECTION IS A HUMBLING
EXPERIENCE.


[Captioner] 20:00:37
AS AN INCUMBENT CANDIDATE, I DID


[Captioner] 20:00:40
NOT TAKE

[Captioner] 20:00:43
 THE CAMPAIGN LIGHTLY.
I WAS SO BLESSED WITH THIS
OPPORTUNITY WHERE I

[Captioner] 20:00:47
 APPROACHED
MANY RESIDENTS AND VOTERS IN

[Captioner] 20:00:51
 MY
DISTRICT, LISTENING TO THEIR
CONCERNS ABOUT

[Captioner] 20:00:55
 PUBLIC SAFETY,
TRAFFIC, HOMELESSNESS,

[Captioner] 20:00:58
 AND OTHER
ISSUES,

[Captioner] 20:01:01
 AND BLESSED WITH THE
SUPPORT OF

[Captioner] 20:01:04
 MANY FRIENDS AND
ORGANIZATIONS

[Captioner] 20:01:08
 OF WHICH SOME OF
THE REPRESENTATIVES ARE IN THE


[Captioner] 20:01:11
AUDIENCE TO ENJOY THE VICTORY
WITH ME.


[Captioner] 20:01:16
OF COURSE, THE ELECTION IS OVER,
THE MENTALITY NEEDS

[Captioner] 20:01:19
 TO BE
CHANGED FROM

[Captioner] 20:01:23
 EVERYTHING ABOUT ME
TO ABOUT

[Captioner] 20:01:26
 US, THE FREMONT
RESIDENTS.
I LOOK FORWARD TO

[Captioner] 20:01:30
 THE UPCOMING
RETREAT WHERE

[Captioner] 20:01:33
 THE WHOLE CITY
COUNCIL CAN REVIEW, REGROUP,

[Captioner] 20:01:37
 AND
REORIENT ON OUR

[Captioner] 20:01:41
 FOCUSES, AND I
WILL KEEP MY PROMISE TO

[Captioner] 20:01:43
 REFLECT
ALL THE CONCERNS I HAVE

[Captioner] 20:01:47

FROM THE

[Captioner] 20:02:15

SUPPORT, AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST,
I WANT TO THANK

PREPARED AND DO YOUR HOMEWORK
AND BE WILLING TO

[Captioner] 20:04:13
 DELIBERATE IN
AN OPEN CHANGE WITH THE CITY
COUNCIL, SO I LOOK FORWARD

[Captioner] 20:04:15
 TO
THAT COLLABORATION AND THE TEAM
WORK.


[Captioner] 20:04:21
AND I ALSO WANT TO CONGRATULATE
COUNCILMEMBER

[Captioner] 20:04:24
 KASSAN, AS WELL AS
COUNCILMEMBER YANG SHAO.


[Captioner] 20:04:28
I APPRECIATE YOUR SERVICE AND
LOOK FORWARD TO

[Captioner] 20:04:30
 ANOTHER FOUR
YEARS, WHERE WE CAN GET A LOT OF
THINGS DONE FOR FREMONT


[Captioner] 20:04:33
RESIDENTS.
WE HAVE MUCH THINGS THAT WE
SHARE IN

[Captioner] 20:04:36
 COMMON, AND A LOT THAT
WE CAN DO TOGETHER IF WE ALL PUT
OUR

[Captioner] 20:04:39
 MIND TO IT.
I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO NOTE THAT
THIS IS

[Captioner] 20:04:43
 A UNIQUE COUNCIL.
WE

[Captioner] 20:04:46
 HAVE MAJORITY WOMEN, SO YANG
SHAO AND MYSELF ARE

[Captioner] 20:04:49
 THE ONLY TWO
MEN

[Captioner] 20:04:52
 LEFT, SO THE LAST TWO
STANDING.
SO I LOOK FORWARD

[Captioner] 20:04:55
 TO WORKING
WITH ALL THE STRONG WOMEN, BOTH


[Captioner] 20:04:58
ON CITY COUNCIL AS WELL AS OUR
DISTINGUISHED

[Captioner] 20:05:02
 MAYOR, WHO'S ALSO
A VERY STRONG WOMAN AND OUR CITY
MANAGEMENT

[Captioner] 20:05:05
 AND ALL THE GREAT
LEADERSHIP.
AND ALSO I WOULD LIKE TO

[Captioner] 20:05:08
 NOTE,
THIS IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST
DIVERSE COUNCILS WE'VE EVER

[Captioner] 20:05:11
 HAD.
AND SO I APPRECIATE THAT AS
WELL, THAT EACH ONE

[Captioner] 20:05:14
 OF US BRINGS
DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES, BOTH
FROM

[Captioner] 20:05:18
 DEMOGRAPHICS BUT AS ALSO
DIVERSITY OF THOUGHT AS WELL.
SO

[Captioner] 20:05:21
 THAT'S VERY SIGNIFICANT.
I OFTEN GO BY THE HALLWAYS HERE
AND

[Captioner] 20:05:25
 I SEE THE PHOTOS FROM THE
50s AND YOU SEE THE

[Captioner] 20:05:28

TRANSITIONS, YOU'LL SEE LIKE ONE
ASIAN AND THEN IT WILL DISAPPEAR


[Captioner] 20:05:31
FOR A WHILE, AND THEN IT WILL
COME BACK AND NOW WHEN

[Captioner] 20:05:33
 I SEE,
I'M LIKE, OH, IT'S CHANGING A
LOT.


[Captioner] 20:05:36
SO THIS NEXT PICTURE SHOULD BE
QUITE DIFFERENT.
AND SO

[Captioner] 20:05:39
 THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT
MOMENT FOR EACH OF YOU
INDIVIDUALLY,

[Captioner] 20:05:41
 US COLLECTIVELY
AND ALSO FOR THE CITY OF
FREMONT.


[Captioner] 20:05:45
WE'VE COME A LONG WAYS AND I
LOOK FORWARD

[Captioner] 20:05:47
 TO THIS DIVERSITY
CONTINUING.
SO AGAIN, CONGRATULATIONS TO ALL


[Captioner] 20:05:50
OF YOU, LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING
WITH ALL OF YOU IN GREAT SPIRIT,
AND LET'S

[Captioner] 20:05:54
 CONTINUE THE
DISCUSSIONS AT OUR RETREAT TO
MAKE SURE THAT

[Captioner] 20:05:57
 WE DEVELOP A
CONSENSUS WHERE WE CAN AGREE ON
THE ISSUES

[Captioner] 20:06:00
 OF COMMON CONCERN OF
OUR FREMONT RESIDENTS SO THAT WE
HAVE A PLAN THAT

[Captioner] 20:06:03
 WE CAN WORK
TOGETHER ON SO THAT WE ARE A
TEAM

[Captioner] 20:06:06

[Captioner] 20:06:48
 TRUSTEES FROM
BEING ON THE OHLONE COLLEGE
BOARD AND

[Captioner] 20:06:53
 COUNCILWOMAN CAMPBELL
BEING ON THE SCHOOL BOARD, SO
IT'S NICE THAT WE'RE NOW ON

[Captioner] 20:06:56
 THE
SAME TEAM, AND WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN
ON THE SAME TEAM BUT

[Captioner] 20:06:59
 LOOK
FORWARD TO WORKING TOGETHER.
AND I

[Captioner] 20:07:02
 THINK THAT HAVING SOLID
EDUCATION AND

[Captioner] 20:07:08
 EXPERIENCES WILL
FEED YOU WELL, VERY WELL ON CITY
COUNCIL.


[Captioner] 20:07:11
AND ALSO I'M GLAD TO SEE BACK


[Captioner] 20:07:15
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN AND

[Captioner] 20:07:18
 YANG
FOR BEING ABLE TO RETURN

[Captioner] 20:07:21
 AND BE
ABLE TO WORK TOGETHER AND FINISH
MORE

[Captioner] 20:07:25
 BUSINESS THAT WE CAN ALL
MAKE FREMONT A

[Captioner] 20:07:29
 BETTER PLACE.
I THINK THIS IS THE FIRST TIME
IN HISTORY THAT WE'VE EVER

[Captioner] 20:07:34
 HAD
TWO AFRICAN AMERICANS CERTAINING
TOGETHER ON CITY COUNCIL BUT


[Captioner] 20:07:37
ALSO THE MOST DIVERSITY OF WOMEN

[Captioner] 20:07:41
SO WE NO WHEN DIVERSITY
SUCCEEDS, SO DO OUR COMMUNITIES.


[Captioner] 20:07:45
AND THAT ADDS

[Captioner] 20:07:48
 VALUE, IT ADDS
REPRESENTATION AND
WELL-ROUNDEDNESS AND THE

[Captioner] 20:07:49
 VIEWS
THAT WE REPRESENT ALL OF
FREMONT.


[Captioner] 20:07:52
SO I LOOK FORWARD TO ALL OF US
WORKING TOGETHER TO

[Captioner] 20:07:56
 CONTINUE TO
BUILD A BETTER

[Captioner] 20:07:59
 COMMUNITY, NOW
AND GOING FORWARD AND LOOK
FORWARD TO THE

[Captioner] 20:08:02
 PARTNERSHIPS AND
THE SHARING OF EXCHANGES OF OUR


[Captioner] 20:08:05
DIVERSE LEVELS OF THOUGHT AND


[Captioner] 20:08:09
PROCESSES.
AND SO I THINK THIS IS REALLY
GOING

[Captioner] 20:08:12
 TO UNITE FREMONT TO
ANOTHER LEVEL.
SO THANK YOU AND I

[Captioner] 20:08:15
 WISH ALL OF
MY COUNCILMEMBERS A HAPPY


[Captioner] 20:08:18
HOLIDAYS AND LOOK FORWARD TO
CONTINUE TO WORK TOGETHER IN THE
NEW

[Captioner] 20:08:21
 YEAR.


[Captioner] 20:08:30
>> Mayor Mei: COUNCILMEMBER
SHAO.
>> Councilmember Shao: THANK


[Captioner] 20:08:34
YOU, MADAME MAYOR.
BEFORE I ALWAYS CONFESSED THAT I
FOLLOWED

[Captioner] 20:08:37
 YOUR FOOTSTEPS FROM THE
SCHOOL DISTRICT TO THE CITY
COUNCIL.


[Captioner] 20:08:41
NOW LOOKING AT OUR NEWLY

[Captioner] 20:08:45
 ELECTED
COUNCILMEMBER DESRIE CAMPBELL, I


[Captioner] 20:08:48
CAN BRAG NOW SOMEONE HAS ALREADY
FOLLOWED OUR FOOTSTEPS.


[Captioner] 20:08:57
SEEMS LIKE THE TRICK FOR
SUCCESS.
I BELIEVE

[Captioner] 20:09:00
 THAT THIS ACTUALLY


[Captioner] 20:09:04
REPRESENTS MORE OF THE
COLLABORATION AND

[Captioner] 20:09:08
 SUCCESS
BETWEEN THE SCHOOL BOARD AND

[Captioner] 20:09:11
 THE
CITY COUNCIL AND I BELIEVE

[Captioner] 20:09:15
 THAT
YOUR JOINING THE CITY COUNCIL
WILL BRING

[Captioner] 20:09:18
 NOT ONLY FRESH BLOOD,
FRESH MIND,

[Captioner] 20:09:22
 BUT ALSO YOUR UNIQUE
EXPERTISE AND

[Captioner] 20:09:25
 EXPERIENCE AND
SKILLS TO

[Captioner] 20:09:29
 THE CITY COUNCIL.
WELCOME TO THE CITY COUNCIL.
AND BY

[Captioner] 20:09:32
 LOOKING AROUND, I THINK
THE LESSON FOR ME AND

[Captioner] 20:09:35
 RAJ TO
LEARN IS TO BETTER JUST WORK
WITH

[Captioner] 20:09:38
 THE WOMEN BECAUSE IN ORDER
TO GET

[Captioner] 20:09:42
 SOMETHING DONE AND GET
THE MAJORITY VOTES, YOU KNOW, WE
HAVE TO WORK AS

[Captioner] 20:09:45
 A TEAM, AND


[Captioner] 20:09:49
REALLY LISTEN, LISTEN TO THE
WOMEN, WHICH

[Captioner] 20:09:52
 IS ALSO MY -- THE
LESSON MY WIFE HAS BEEN TEACHING


[Captioner] 20:09:55
ME AT HOME.
SO I

[Captioner] 20:09:59
 WANT TO CONGRATULATE
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN

[Captioner] 20:10:02
 FOR BEING
RE-ELECTED AND AS I SAID

[Captioner] 20:10:06
 BEFORE,
I'M COMMITTED TO WORKING AS A
TEAM WITH

[Captioner] 20:10:09
 OUR WONDERFUL CITY
STAFF AS

[Captioner] 20:10:12
 A TEAM, AND THEN

[Captioner] 20:10:16
 KEEP
FREMONT ON THE RIGHT

[Captioner] 20:10:19
 TRACK TO
MAINTAIN AS THE HAPPIEST CITY IN
THE

[Captioner] 20:10:22
 U.S.
THANK

[Captioner] 20:10:28
 YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: REAL

[Captioner] 20:10:31
 QUICKLY I
WANTED TO WELCOME OUR NEW
COUNCILMEMBERS THAT HAVE


[Captioner] 20:10:34
RETURNED, COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN
AND COUNCILMEMBER

[Captioner] 20:10:37
 SHAO, AS WELL
AS COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL.
I'VE HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF


[Captioner] 20:10:41
WORKING ALONGSIDE YOU BEFORE, AS
WE

[Captioner] 20:10:44
 SAT TOGETHER SERVING THE
STUDENTS IN OUR COMMUNITY, AND
WE WILL

[Captioner] 20:10:47
 WORK TOGETHER AGAIN TO
SERVE THE COMMUNITY AS

[Captioner] 20:10:51
 A WHOLE.
I ALSO AM JUST

[Captioner] 20:10:54
 MARVELING AT --
EARLIER WE TOOK A PICTURE AND
WHILE

[Captioner] 20:10:57
 WE WERE THE

[Captioner] 20:11:01
 HAPPIEST CITY,
THE SECOND YES CITY IN
CALIFORNIA AND

[Captioner] 20:11:04
 THE FOURTH
HAPPIEST IN THE UNITED STATES
AND WE'LL WORK HARD TOGETHER TO


[Captioner] 20:11:07
GET BACK TO THAT POINT, BUT I
WANTED TO SAY THAT IT'S AMAZING,
WHEN

[Captioner] 20:11:10
 I LOOK AT THE PICTURE, THAT
WHEN I JOINED COUNCIL, I

[Captioner] 20:11:14
 WAS THE
ONLY WOMAN WITH THE GENTLEMEN,


[Captioner] 20:11:17
IF WE LOOK AT THAT

[Captioner] 20:11:20
 WALL, HOW IT
HAS REALLY TRANSITIONED AND HOW
I WAS VERY EXCITED

[Captioner] 20:11:23
 TO SEE THAT
DURING THIS LAST FEW YEARS,
WE'VE HAD

[Captioner] 20:11:27
 THE FIRST TIME EVER
MAJORITY

[Captioner] 20:11:31
 MINORITY COUNCIL, FIRST
TIME EVER FEMALE COUNCIL,

[Captioner] 20:11:35
 AND
OTHER GREAT FIRSTS SUCH AS NOW
THE GREATER DIVERSITY

[Captioner] 20:11:38
 THAT WE
SEE WITH BOTH YOU AND


[Captioner] 20:11:42
COUNCILMEMBER COX AS


[Captioner] 20:11:45
REPRESENTING DIVERSE MEMBERS OF
OUR COMMUNITY AND ALSO

[Captioner] 20:11:48
 THAT
TOGETHER WE CAN HAVE A LOT MORE
CONVERSATIONS ON

[Captioner] 20:11:52
 DELIVERING THE
CARE THAT WE NEED IN

[Captioner] 20:11:55
 THIS
TRANSFORMATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE
TIMES AND BUILD

[Captioner] 20:11:58
 THE BETTER
COMMUNITY.
SO WITH THAT, I ALSO

[Captioner] 20:12:04
 WANTED TO
RETURN THEN TO PUBLIC COMMENT
AND I KNOW THAT WE HAD A SPEAKER


[Captioner] 20:12:09
EARLIER ON ZOOM.
ARE THEY STILL THERE?


[Captioner] 20:12:13
IT WAS SPECIFICALLY ON A
DIFFERENT ITEM AT THAT TIME,

[Captioner] 20:12:18

BUT --
>> Ms. Gauthier: IT WAS LIZETTE,


[Captioner] 20:12:21
ALTHOUGH I'M NOT SEEING LIZETTE
ON

[Captioner] 20:12:25
 ZOOM NOW.


[Captioner] 20:12:29
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY.
>> Ms. Gauthier: DO WE HAVE

[Captioner] 20:12:32
 ANY
OTHER -- I DON'T SEE ANY OTHER
HANDS

[Captioner] 20:12:37
 RAISED.
IF ANY ATTENDEES ON ZOOM WANT TO
SPEAK UNDER ORAL

[Captioner] 20:12:40
 COMMUNICATIONS,
YOU NEED TO RAISE YOUR HAND NOW,
BEFORE WE MOVE ON.


[Captioner] 20:12:49
OKAY.
>> Mayor Mei: NEXT I'LL RETURN
TO OUR REGULARLY

[Captioner] 20:12:53
 SCHEDULED
ITEMS.
AND I WANTED TO

[Captioner] 20:12:56
 HAVE A COUNCIL
REFERRAL, AND THAT'S ITEM 7A,
WHICH

[Captioner] 20:12:59
 IS TO DIRECT STAFF TO
ARRANGE FOR FORMAL REVIEW OF


[Captioner] 20:13:02
CLOSED SESSION BROWN ACT


[Captioner] 20:13:05
CONFIDENTIALITY REQUIREMENTS,
AND TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL
ACTIONS

[Captioner] 20:13:09
 TO ADDRESS ANY
VIOLATIONS OR

[Captioner] 20:13:12
 MISCONDUCT.
AND ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS?
AT THIS

[Captioner] 20:13:15
 TIME?


[Captioner] 20:13:20
QUESTION FROM COUNCILMEMBER
KASSAN.


[Captioner] 20:13:25
>> Councilmember Kassan: I WAS
WONDERING WHAT THIS WAS
REFERRING TO IN

[Captioner] 20:13:29
 TERMS OF
DELIBERATE ACTIONS AND PUBLIC
VIOLATIONS

[Captioner] 20:13:32
 SPECIFICALLY AND ALSO
I NOTICED IT SAID

[Captioner] 20:13:35
 FOLLOW-UP OF
PREVIOUSLY APPROVED AND FUTURE


[Captioner] 20:13:38
CENSURES, AND THAT WAS CONFUSING
TO ME BECAUSE I DON'T BELIEVE
THERE HAVE

[Captioner] 20:13:41
 BEEN ANY CENSURES AS
FAR AS I

[Captioner] 20:13:45
 KNOW, AND WERE YOU
PLANNING TO CONSIDER A

[Captioner] 20:13:48
 CENSURE
AND IF SO, CAN YOU SHARE DETAILS
ABOUT THAT?


[Captioner] 20:13:51
>> Mayor Mei: SURE.
I THINK IT'S A GOOD TIME WHEN WE
HAVE A

[Captioner] 20:13:54
 CHANGE IN GOVERNANCE TEAM
TO FOLLOW UP AND HAVE

[Captioner] 20:13:58
 TRAINING
ON THE FORMAL REVIEW OF CLOSED
SESSION BROWN

[Captioner] 20:14:01
 ACT
CONFIDENTIALITY REQUIREMENTS,
AND ALSO TO ADDRESS

[Captioner] 20:14:04
 ANY ACTIONS
THAT WE WANTED TO TAKE.
I KNOW WHEN WE

[Captioner] 20:14:07
 WENT THROUGH OUR
HANDBOOK DISCUSSION, THERE HAD
BEEN A

[Captioner] 20:14:10
 QUESTION RAISED IN TERMS
OF WHAT ARE THE POTENTIAL
ACTIONS

[Captioner] 20:14:14
 TO ADDRESS VIOLATIONS.
WE'VE HAD REFERRALS IN THE PAST
FOR

[Captioner] 20:14:18
 CENSURE, AND JUST TO MAKE
SURE THAT WE UNDERSTAND WHAT THE


[Captioner] 20:14:22
FOLLOW-UP ACTIONS COULD BE.
AND SO I THINK IT'S GREAT TO
HAVE THE

[Captioner] 20:14:25
 TRAINING, AND IT'S
IMPORTANT FOR US

[Captioner] 20:14:29
 TO ALL ALWAYS
BE UPDATED IN THIS AREA.


[Captioner] 20:14:32
AND SO DO YOU HAVE ANY OTHER
QUESTIONS?


[Captioner] 20:14:36
THANK YOU.
COUNCILMEMBER KENG, DID YOU HAVE


[Captioner] 20:14:39
YOUR HAND RAISED?


[Captioner] 20:14:42
>> Vice Mayor Keng: I DID.
SO I ALSO HAD A QUESTION

[Captioner] 20:14:46

REGARDING EARLIER

[Captioner] 20:14:50
 COUNCILMEMBER
KASSAN MENTIONED A PREVIOUSLY


[Captioner] 20:14:54
APPROVED CENSURE.
IF CITY MANAGER SHACKELFORD

[Captioner] 20:14:58
 AND
CITY ATTORNEY ALVARADO CAN
CLARIFY IF THERE WAS

[Captioner] 20:15:01
 EVER AN
APPROVED CENSURE?


[Captioner] 20:15:06
BECAUSE THAT STATEMENT COULD BE
MISLEADING.


[Captioner] 20:15:09
>> City Mgr. Shackelford: THERE
HAVE BEEN NO PREVIOUSLY APPROVED
CENSURES.


[Captioner] 20:15:12
>> Vice Mayor Keng: SO WE SHOULD
PROBABLY RE-WORD THAT IF IT'S --
>> Mayor Mei: WELL,

[Captioner] 20:15:15
 I BELIEVE
THERE WAS A PREVIOUSLY APPROVED
REFERRAL, BUT WE DID NOT HEAR


[Captioner] 20:15:18
BACK AT THAT TIME FROM OUR LEGAL


[Captioner] 20:15:22
ATTORNEY.
BECAUSE THERE WAS A PAST -- IT
WAS AGENDIZED ON THE COUNCIL


[Captioner] 20:15:29
AGENDA.
AND CITY ATTORNEY, WOULD YOU
LIKE TO COMMENT?


[Captioner] 20:15:33
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: JUST
WANT TO ECHO WHAT CITY MANAGER
SHACKELFORD

[Captioner] 20:15:36
 SAID THAT THERE WAS
NOT AN APPROVED CENSURE.
I UNDERSTAND

[Captioner] 20:15:39
 THERE MAY HAVE BEEN
A PROCESS THAT WAS INITIATED BUT
IT DID NOT

[Captioner] 20:15:42
 RESULT IN A APPROVED
CENSURE.
>> Mayor Mei: 

[Captioner] 20:15:46
OKAY, IT WAS VOTED
ON BY THE COUNCIL AT THAT TIME,
THOUGH, FOR THE

[Captioner] 20:15:49
 REFERRAL.
ZOO

[Captioner] 20:15:52
SO I JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY THAT
BUT I THINK

[Captioner] 20:15:55
 IT'S IMPORTANT TO
CLARIFY WHAT THE PROCESS IS.


[Captioner] 20:15:58
>> Vice Mayor Keng: SO AS STATED
IN THE REFERRAL, IT SAYS
PREVIOUSLY

[Captioner] 20:16:01
 APPROVED AND IT WOULD
NOT BE A CORRECT STATEMENT
ACCORDING

[Captioner] 20:16:04
 TO CITY ATTORNEY AND
CITY MANAGER.


[Captioner] 20:16:07
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: A
REFERRAL IS DIFFERENT THAN A
CENSURE.


[Captioner] 20:16:11
A CENSURE IS A CONCLUSION OF A
PROCESS

[Captioner] 20:16:14
 THAT HAS BASICALLY
CONCLUDED THAT MISCONDUCT MAY
HAVE OCCURRED OR

[Captioner] 20:16:17
 THAT THERE WAS
BEHAVIOR THAT RESULTED IN A


[Captioner] 20:16:22
CENSURE, AND THAT DID NOT OCCUR.
THERE WAS NO FINAL APPROVAL OF A


[Captioner] 20:16:24
CENSURE.
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY.
THERE'S NO FINAL APPROVAL OF THE


[Captioner] 20:16:28
CENSURE, BUT THE COUNCIL VOTED
AND IF ANYONE HAS QUESTIONS,
THAT'S

[Captioner] 20:16:31
 STILL ON THE RECORD.


[Captioner] 20:16:36
SO I JUST WANTED TO NOTE THAT.
>> Vice Mayor Keng: I SEE

[Captioner] 20:16:38
 CITY
MANAGER SHACKELFORD SHAKING HER
HEAD, SO IF YOU WANT TO CLARIFY.


[Captioner] 20:16:41
>> City Mgr. Shackelford: I
THINK THAT'S ALL THE CLARITY WE
CAN OFFER AT THIS POINT.


[Captioner] 20:16:44
THERE'S NO PREVIOUSLY APPROVED
CENSURE.


[Captioner] 20:16:48
>> Vice Mayor Keng: SO IF WE'RE
GOING TO VOTE TO

[Captioner] 20:16:52
 HAVE A --

[Captioner] 20:16:57
 HAVE
STAFF WORK ON A MEETING,

[Captioner] 20:17:00
 WE
WOULD CORRECT THAT STATEMENT.


[Captioner] 20:17:04
>> Mayor Mei: WELL, I THINK THAT
IT'S ALWAYS GOOD TO HAVE THE
FORMAL TRAINING

[Captioner] 20:17:08
 FOR THE CLOSED
SESSION BROWN ACT UNLESS PEOPLE
DO NOT WANT

[Captioner] 20:17:11
 TO SUPPORT TRAINING
FOR THE CLOSED SESSION BROWN

[Captioner] 20:17:13

ACT.
AND CONFIDENTIALITY.


[Captioner] 20:17:17
>> Vice Mayor Keng: I DON'T


[Captioner] 20:17:20
DISAGREE ON THE TRAINING, BUT
I'M JUST SAYING WHEN WE'RE


[Captioner] 20:17:24
PUTTING TOGETHER A WHOLE
REFERRAL AND

[Captioner] 20:17:28
 VOTING ON THE
REFERRAL, THEN WE SHOULD MAKE
SURE THAT ALL

[Captioner] 20:17:32
 PARTS OF THE
REFERRAL SHOULD BE CORRECT.


[Captioner] 20:17:35
>> City Mgr. Shackelford: SO
THIS IS THE MAYOR'S REFERRAL,
AND THE POINT THAT YOU'RE MAKING


[Captioner] 20:17:38
IS FOR YOU ALL TO DELIBERATE AND
MAKE A

[Captioner] 20:17:41
 DECISION ON IN TERMS OF
THE WORDING OF THE REFERRAL

[Captioner] 20:17:44
 AND
WHAT IT IS THAT YOU MOVE
FORWARD, IF YOU MOVE

[Captioner] 20:17:47
 ANYTHING
FORWARD AT ALL.
>> Mayor Mei: I WOULD

[Captioner] 20:17:50
 HOPE THAT
EVERYBODY WOULD AGREE THAT WE
NEED TO MAKE SURE, WHENEVER


[Captioner] 20:17:54
THERE'S A CHANGE IN GOVERNANCE,
THAT WE WOULD

[Captioner] 20:17:57
 ALWAYS SUPPORT THE
TRAINING OF CLOSED SESSION

[Captioner] 20:18:00
 BROWN
ACT, TRAINING, AND WE'VE DONE
THIS BEFORE IN THE PAST AS

[Captioner] 20:18:03
 A
COUNCIL.
AND ALSO THE CON FI

[Captioner] 20:18:07
 CONFIDENTIALITY
REQUIREMENTS.


[Captioner] 20:18:13
YES.
>> City Mgr. Shackelford: WE
ALWAYS MAKE A STATEMENT DURING


[Captioner] 20:18:17
OUR CLOSED SESSIONS TO ENSURE
THAT EVERYONE IS CLEAR ON

[Captioner] 20:18:20
 THE
CONFIDENTIALITY THAT'S REQUIRED
IN CLOSED

[Captioner] 20:18:23
 SESSIONS, AND THE
BROWN ACT TRAINING IS ALWAYS


[Captioner] 20:18:28
READILY AVAILABLE TO ANY AND ALL
COUNCILMEMBERS THROUGH THEIR ON


[Captioner] 20:18:31
BOARDING, THROUGH THE VARIOUS
LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES
TRAININGS AND

[Captioner] 20:18:34
 FROM OUR OWN
STAFF.
>> Mayor Mei: I WOULD LIKE TO


[Captioner] 20:18:37
SEE THAT INCLUDED AGAIN IN OUR
RETREAT.


[Captioner] 20:18:43
COUNCILMEMBER COX.
>> Councilmember Cox: YES, I
ALSO WANTED TO MAKE SURE IT'S


[Captioner] 20:18:47
ALSO CLEAR THAT EVERY -- I
BELIEVE EVERY TWO YEARS

[Captioner] 20:18:50
 THAT THE
FPPC, THE FAIR

[Captioner] 20:18:53
 POLITICAL
PRACTICE COMMISSION, DOES
REQUIRE THAT ALL OF US HAVE

[Captioner] 20:18:58
 TO
SIGN AND GO THROUGH THE

[Captioner] 20:19:02
 BROWN
ACT, GO THROUGH CODES OF

[Captioner] 20:19:06
 THE
CONFLICT OF INTEREST, ALL THOSE
HAVE TO BE SIGNED AND

[Captioner] 20:19:09
 DOCUMENTED
AND SUBMITTED TO OUR CITY CLERK,
WHO

[Captioner] 20:19:12
 THEN FORWARDS IT ON TO THE
COMMISSION IF

[Captioner] 20:19:15
 NOT EVERY YEAR,
EVERY

[Captioner] 20:19:19
 OTHER YEAR, THOSE THINGS
ARE COVERED, AND SO THERE'S EVEN


[Captioner] 20:19:22
A SELF ONLINE TRAINING AS WELL
THAT'S AVAILABLE ON THE

[Captioner] 20:19:26
 WEBSITE
OF THE

[Captioner] 20:19:31
 FPPC REGARDING BROWN ACT
AND CONFIDENTIALITY, SO THERE IS
A LOT

[Captioner] 20:19:34
 OF ACCESS OF BEING ABLE TO
DOWNLOAD AND REVIEW ALL THOSE
DOCUMENTS,

[Captioner] 20:19:37
 AND ONCE YOU COMPLETE
IT, YOU HAVE TO SIGN OFF ON THE


[Captioner] 20:19:41
CERTIFICATION THAT YOU COMPLETED
IT AS WELL.


[Captioner] 20:19:44
AND I THINK THAT THAT'S ALSO
SOMETHING THAT ALSO

[Captioner] 20:19:49
 SHOULD BE
ALREADY DONE ALREADY, AND THE
NEW

[Captioner] 20:19:52
 COUNCILMEMBERS THAT HAVE
BEEN NEWLY ELECTED, THAT THEY


[Captioner] 20:19:55
WILL FOLLOW THAT.
IT'S A PROCESS, THEY CHECK IT,
THEY SEND

[Captioner] 20:19:59
 NOTICES TO OUR CITY
CLERK TO MAKE SURE

[Captioner] 20:20:02
 THAT'S ALL IN
COMPLIANCE, AND I STAND
CORRECTED IF

[Captioner] 20:20:05
 THERE'S THE
FREQUENCY

[Captioner] 20:20:07
 OR --
>> Ms. Gauthier: I JUST WANT TO
BE CLEAR, IT'S NOT BROWN ACT


[Captioner] 20:20:11
TRAINING, IT'S THE

[Captioner] 20:20:14
 AB1234 IS THE
ETHICS TRAINING FOR LOCAL


[Captioner] 20:20:18
OFFICIALS THAT I KEEP TRACK OF,
AND I'LL

[Captioner] 20:20:21
 BE PROVIDING


[Captioner] 20:20:24
COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL WITH AND
THAT'S WHAT I KEEP TRACK.
IT'S NOT BROWN ACT

[Captioner] 20:20:27
 TRAINING.
IT'S ETHICS TRAINING FOR LOCAL
OFFICIALS.


[Captioner] 20:20:30
>> Councilmember Cox: OKAY,
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU FOR THE CLARIFICATION.


[Captioner] 20:20:34
I APPRECIATE THAT.
BUT I KNOW THERE'S SOME OTHER
TRAINING THAT IS

[Captioner] 20:20:37
 ON THE FPPC AS
WELL,

[Captioner] 20:20:40
 THAT ONE CAN ALSO

[Captioner] 20:20:46
 ACCESS.
I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO SHARE SOME
COMMENTS ON THIS REFERRAL.


[Captioner] 20:20:52
I REALLY -- YOU KNOW, I'M TRYING


[Captioner] 20:20:55
TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS REALLY
BEHIND THIS WHOLE REFERRAL.


[Captioner] 20:20:58
I REALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND IT.
AND THEN THE

[Captioner] 20:21:01
 OTHER
RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT
COMMUNICATING MISINFORMATION OR


[Captioner] 20:21:05
FALSEHOOD DAMAGING THE CITY, AND


[Captioner] 20:21:08
COUNCILMEMBERS ATTENDANCE AT
CITY COUNCIL AND CLOSED SESSION
MEETINGS.


[Captioner] 20:21:15
WHAT'S THE IDEA OF GOING THROUGH
AND MAKING THESE TYPE OF


[Captioner] 20:21:19
RECOMMENDATIONS, SINCE YOU'RE
THE AUTHOR OF THIS, MAYOR MEI, I
WOULD LIKE FOR YOU TO

[Captioner] 20:21:22
 SHED SOME
MORE DETAILS ON THAT.


[Captioner] 20:21:26
>> Mayor Mei: SURE.
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO
ENSURE THAT WE HAVE

[Captioner] 20:21:29
 TRANSPARENCY
OF THE PROCESSES.
THERE HAS BEEN CERTAINLY SOME


[Captioner] 20:21:33
MISCOMMUNICATION ABOUT OUR CITY
AND OUR FINANCIAL

[Captioner] 20:21:37
 STANDINGS AND
OTHER AREAS WHICH HAVE SHARED


[Captioner] 20:21:40
CONFUSION, AND I THINK THAT THEY
COULD BE IMPACTFUL TO

[Captioner] 20:21:44
 OUR CITY,
AS WELL AS MAKING SURE THAT WHEN
IT COMES TO

[Captioner] 20:21:48
 AREAS SUCH AS
AWARENESS AND TRAINING, THAT

[Captioner] 20:21:52
 WE
ARE -- ONE OF THE THINGS WE'VE
TALKED ABOUT

[Captioner] 20:21:55
 IS HOW WE WORK WITH
ONE ANOTHER AS COLLEAGUES, AND I
THINK AS A

[Captioner] 20:21:58
 GOVERNANCE TEAM, IT'S
IMPORTANT TO HAVE THAT TRAINING,
AND ALSO

[Captioner] 20:22:01
 AWARENESS ESPECIALLY IF
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

[Captioner] 20:22:04
 LACK OF
REPRESENTATION AT CLOSED
SESSION, THAT WE LET

[Captioner] 20:22:07
 PEOPLE
KNOW, YOU KNOW, THE
PARTICIPATION IS

[Captioner] 20:22:10
 VOLUNTARY, AND
SO HOPEFULLY PEOPLE DO
PARTICIPATE IN THAT.


[Captioner] 20:22:18
>> Councilmember Cox: I WOULD
LIKE TO ADD THAT I THINK THAT WE
NEED TO MAKE

[Captioner] 20:22:22
 SURE THAT THIS
REFERRAL IS NOT

[Captioner] 20:22:25
 LEANING TOWARDS
PERSONAL AGENDA, AND IT DOESN'T
CROSS OVER TO BE A

[Captioner] 20:22:28
 PLATFORM FOR
THE CITY OF FREMONT.
AND MY

[Captioner] 20:22:32
 CONCERN IS THAT WE AS
ELECTED OFFICIALS,

[Captioner] 20:22:35
 WE WORK FOR
THE PEOPLE OF FREMONT.


[Captioner] 20:22:40
AND I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS NOT
CARRYING OUT AND PUTTING

[Captioner] 20:22:45
 FREMONT
FIRST IN THIS TYPE OF REFERRAL.
WE SHOULD BE SPENDING MORE TIME


[Captioner] 20:22:48
FOCUSING ON WHAT OUR PEOPLE OF
THE CITY OF

[Captioner] 20:22:51
 FREMONT NEED.
JOBS.
THEY NEED HOUSING.


[Captioner] 20:22:55
THEY NEED TRANSPORTATION.
THEY NEED HOW CAN

[Captioner] 20:22:58
 WE HELP DURING
THIS

[Captioner] 20:23:01
 RECESSION TO MAKE THE
COMMUNITY BE BETTER OFF AND THE
QUALITY OF LIFE HERE IN FREMONT.


[Captioner] 20:23:06
I JUST GET THE FEELING THAT THIS
IS

[Captioner] 20:23:09
 MORE THAN WHAT IS STATED
HERE, AND I THINK THAT

[Captioner] 20:23:13
 WE NEED
TO REALLY PUT THIS IN THE RIGHT


[Captioner] 20:23:16
PERSPECTIVE AND MAKING SURE THAT
THIS IS ALL SOMETHING

[Captioner] 20:23:20
 THAT IS
THE BEST INTEREST OF THE PEOPLE


[Captioner] 20:23:23
THAT WE REPRESENT AND ALL OF US
WORKING TOGETHER.
WE JUST HAD

[Captioner] 20:23:26
 A WONDERFUL EVENING
WITH

[Captioner] 20:23:29
 THE INSTALLATION AND
SWEARING IN OF OUR

[Captioner] 20:23:32
 NEW
COUNCILMEMBERS AND RE-ELECTION
OF TWO

[Captioner] 20:23:35
 OF THEM, BUT I ALSO THINK
THAT WE'VE GOT TO LOOK

[Captioner] 20:23:39
 AT HOW TO
BEST UTILIZE OUR

[Captioner] 20:23:43
 RESOURCES WITH
THE TIME AND THE EFFORT, AND
THIS IS

[Captioner] 20:23:46
 SOMETHING THAT'S NOT
DONE IN A TRUE SPIRIT OF

[Captioner] 20:23:49
 WORKING
TOGETHER.


[Captioner] 20:23:52
AND I FEEL IT'S MORE OF A FINGER
POINTING AT DIFFERENT PEOPLE
THAT

[Captioner] 20:23:55
 DOESN'T NEED TO GO THERE,
AND I THINK THAT YOU'RE TAKING
TO A

[Captioner] 20:23:59
 MORE PERSONAL AREA THAT IT
IS

[Captioner] 20:24:02
 SOMETHING THAT JUST BECAUSE
YOU LOST THE RACE FOR

[Captioner] 20:24:05
 CALIFORNIA
SENATE DOESN'T MEAN YOU BRING IN
THESE TYPE OF

[Captioner] 20:24:08
 THINGS TO GO AND
BLAME PEOPLE.
THERE'S A LOT

[Captioner] 20:24:12
 OF COMMUNICATION
GOING OUT THERE, A LOT OF PHONE
CALLS BEING MADE

[Captioner] 20:24:15
 TODAY ABOUT
THIS REFERRAL THAT DOES NOT
REFLECT

[Captioner] 20:24:18
 US IN THE BEST INTERESTS
OF ALL OF US

[Captioner] 20:24:21
 COMING TOGETHER AND
UNITING.
WE HAVE TOO MANY PEOPLE ON

[Captioner] 20:24:24
 OUR
CITY STAFF, CITY

[Captioner] 20:24:28
 COUNCILMEMBERS,
IN OUR COMMUNITY WORKING TOO
HARD TO MAKE FREMONT THE BEST


[Captioner] 20:24:31
PLACE TO LIVE.
THIS TYPE OF REFERRAL DOES NOT


[Captioner] 20:24:34
BRING US INTO FREMONT'S LIGHT AS
BEING THE HAPPIEST

[Captioner] 20:24:39
 PLACE.
IT BRINGS NOTHING

[Captioner] 20:24:42
 ABOUT
DISACCORD, DISAGREEMENT, AND
IT'S NOT IN THE SPIRIT OF THIS


[Captioner] 20:24:45
TYPE OF HAPPENING, AND THIS IS
THE MONTH OF DECEMBER WHERE WE
SHOULD

[Captioner] 20:24:48
 BE GIVING BACK TO OUR
COMMUNITY.
DOING THE THINGS

[Captioner] 20:24:52
 TO HELP PEOPLE
BE BETTER OFF.
AND SO I JUST FEEL

[Captioner] 20:24:55
 THAT THIS IS
A WASTE OF TIME OF OUR CITY


[Captioner] 20:24:58
STAFF RESOURCES, OUR TAXPAYERS'


[Captioner] 20:25:01
DOLLARS, AND YOU KNOW, WE'VE GOT
TO LOOK BACK, WHAT WE HAVE RIGHT


[Captioner] 20:25:05
NOW IN FREMONT, WHEN WE LOOK AT
THE

[Captioner] 20:25:08
 FREMONT DOWNTOWN CENTER, IT
TALKS ABOUT

[Captioner] 20:25:12
 THE CORETTA SCOTT
KING'S QUOTE, THE INTERNATIONAL
CIVIL

[Captioner] 20:25:15
 RIGHTS LEADER, AND IT
TALKS ABOUT THE GREATNESS, AND
THIS

[Captioner] 20:25:18
 IS ON THE WALL OF THE
NAMEPLATE OF THE FREMONT
DOWNTOWN CENTER.


[Captioner] 20:25:24
BECAUSE WE PASSED THIS, I TOOK
THE INITIATIVE AND PASSED

[Captioner] 20:25:27
 IT
WITH EVERYBODY'S HELP THAT TALKS
ABOUT ON

[Captioner] 20:25:31
 NOVEMBER 16TH, 2021,
THIS QUOTE WAS ADOPTED.
THE

[Captioner] 20:25:34
 GREATNESS OF A COMMUNITY IS
MOST ACCURATELY

[Captioner] 20:25:38
 MEASURED BY THE
COMPASSIONATE ACTIONS OF ITS


[Captioner] 20:25:42
MEMBERS, A HEART OF GRACE AND
SOUL GENERATED BY LOVE.


[Captioner] 20:25:45
WE ARE HERE TO SERVE WITH GRACE
AND WITH LOVE.


[Captioner] 20:25:48
AND TO WORK WITH EVERYONE.
AND THIS IS NOT

[Captioner] 20:25:51
 WHAT WE'RE
LEADING BY, BY THIS TYPE OF
REFERRAL.


[Captioner] 20:25:55
AND IN CONCLUSION, I ASK ALL OF
MY CITY COUNCILMEMBERS

[Captioner] 20:25:58
 TO NOT
SUPPORT THIS REFERRAL, AND IN
THE WORDS OF

[Captioner] 20:26:02
 DR. MARTIN LUTHER
KING, THE TIME IS ALWAYS RIGHT
TO DO

[Captioner] 20:26:05
 THE RIGHT THING.


[Captioner] 20:26:12
>> Mayor Mei: NEXT IS
COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL.


[Captioner] 20:26:21
>> Councilmember Campbell: THANK
YOU, MAYOR MEI.
I JUST WANT TO HAVE A QUICK


[Captioner] 20:26:23
QUESTION.
>> Mayor Mei: SURE.
>> Councilmember Campbell: IS


[Captioner] 20:26:26
THIS REFERRAL JUST SPECIFICALLY
ASKING THAT WE JUST DO A BROWN
ACT

[Captioner] 20:26:30
 TRAINING DURING OUR

[Captioner] 20:26:32
 RETREAT
IN FEBRUARY?
>> Mayor Mei: YES, IT IS.


[Captioner] 20:26:36
>> Councilmember Campbell: OKAY.
I'M NOT NEW TO BROWN ACT, I'M
NEW TO

[Captioner] 20:26:39
 THE COUNCIL.
BUT I SPENT 10 YEARS

[Captioner] 20:26:42
 WORKING
UNDER THE BROWN ACT ON THE


[Captioner] 20:26:46
FREMONT UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT
BOARD OF EDUCATION.
SO I

[Captioner] 20:26:49
 UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE
OF

[Captioner] 20:26:53
 REGULAR -- REGULAR UPDATES TO
BROWN ACT BECAUSE

[Captioner] 20:26:54
 IT CHANGES.
>> Mayor Mei: YES.
>> Councilmember Campbell: IT


[Captioner] 20:26:57
DEFINITELY CHANGED A LOT WHEN WE
WERE IN COVID.
SO I

[Captioner] 20:27:00
 THINK

[Captioner] 20:27:03
 REFRESHERS, I'M ALL
FOR CONTINUING EDUCATION AND I
THINK REFRESHERS FOR

[Captioner] 20:27:07
 BOARDS OF
THIS SIZE AND OF THIS

[Captioner] 20:27:10
 MAGNITUDE
IN THE ENVIRONMENT THAT WE'RE IN
IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR US TO

[Captioner] 20:27:13
 BE
ABLE TO DO.
WE

[Captioner] 20:27:16
 ACTUALLY, BEFORE I WENT OFF
OF THE BOARD, WE ACTUALLY GOT


[Captioner] 20:27:19
ANOTHER BROWN ACT TRAINING.
I GET ONE EVERY YEAR, IT SEEMS
LIKE.


[Captioner] 20:27:24
SO IF THE -- CAN I THEN JUST
MAKE A

[Captioner] 20:27:28
 MOTION TO APPROVE THE
BROWN ACT TRAINING OR NO?
I'M NOT SURE

[Captioner] 20:27:31
 HOW THAT WORKS.
>> Mayor Mei: SURE.
ACTUALLY WE HAVE A COUPLE PEOPLE


[Captioner] 20:27:33
THAT STILL WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK,
THOUGH.
>> Councilmember Campbell: OKAY.


[Captioner] 20:27:37
THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: COUNCILMEMBER


[Captioner] 20:27:40
KASSAN.
>> Councilmember Kassan: YEAH,
I'M REALLY CONFUSED ABOUT

[Captioner] 20:27:43
 A FEW
THINGS.
NUMBER ONE --

[Captioner] 20:27:46
 WELL FIRST OF ALL
I WANT TO REALLY SUPPORT WHAT
COUNCILMEMBER KENG

[Captioner] 20:27:50
 AND COX SAID.
YOU'RE SAYING THAT THIS IS ABOUT
A BROWN ACT

[Captioner] 20:27:52
 TRAINING BUT THAT'S
NOT WHAT THE REFERRAL SAYS AT
ALL.


[Captioner] 20:27:56
THE WORD "TRAINING" ISN'T EVEN
IN HERE.


[Captioner] 20:27:59
OH, YES, IT IS.
I SEE THAT THE WORD

[Captioner] 20:28:03
 "TRAINING"
IS IN THERE, BUT THERE'S A LOT
OF OTHER THINGS TOO

[Captioner] 20:28:06
 ABOUT
DIRECTING STAFF TO ARRANGE FOR A
FORMAL

[Captioner] 20:28:09
 REVIEW, IDENTIFY
POTENTIAL ACTIONS TO ADDRESS


[Captioner] 20:28:12
VIOLATIONS AND MISCONDUCT.
SO I FEEL LIKE THERE'S A BIT OF


[Captioner] 20:28:15
A DISCONNECT BETWEEN WHAT YOU'RE
SAYING THIS REFERRAL IS ABOUT
AND WHAT THE

[Captioner] 20:28:19
 WORDS ACTUALLY SAY.
ALSO, THESE WORDS

[Captioner] 20:28:22
 BECOME A
FORMAL RECORD, AND IT

[Captioner] 20:28:25
 REALLY
DOES MAKE OUR CITY LOOK PRETTY


[Captioner] 20:28:28
BAD TO USE THIS LANGUAGE AND TO
BE SO UNCLEAR ABOUT WHAT

[Captioner] 20:28:31
 YOU'RE
REFERRING TO.
AND I REALLY

[Captioner] 20:28:35
 AGREE WITH
COUNCILMEMBER KENG THAT TO SAY
THAT THERE WERE

[Captioner] 20:28:38
 PREVIOUSLY
APPROVED CENSURES IN A FOR
MEDICAL/LEGAL DOCUMENT

[Captioner] 20:28:42
 THAT
REPRESENTS -- THAT'S GOING TO BE
IN OUR

[Captioner] 20:28:46
 RECORDS FOR, YOU KNOW,
FOREVER, IS REALLY

[Captioner] 20:28:49
 IRRESPONSIBLE
AND I HOPE WE CAN REMOVE THAT
BECAUSE IT'S

[Captioner] 20:28:52
 COMPLETELY FALSE.
THERE HAVE NEVER BEEN ANY
APPROVED

[Captioner] 20:28:55
 CENSURES.
SO I JUST AM REALLY

[Captioner] 20:28:59
 WONDERING
WHAT COULD HAVE POSSIBLY

[Captioner] 20:29:02
 LED YOU
TO CREATE SUCH

[Captioner] 20:29:05
 A REFERRAL.
I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT
BEFORE.


[Captioner] 20:29:08
AND IF THERE IS A PARTICULAR
COUNCILMEMBER THAT YOU'RE UPSET
WITH, I

[Captioner] 20:29:11
 WOULD HOPE THAT MAYBE
YOU WOULD EITHER BRING THAT TO


[Captioner] 20:29:15
THE PUBLIC INSTEAD OF REFERRING
TO A

[Captioner] 20:29:18
 COUNCILMEMBER AND NOT --
AND BEING

[Captioner] 20:29:22
 COY ABOUT WHO YOU'RE
REFERRING TO, OR MAYBE TALK
PRIVATELY TO THAT

[Captioner] 20:29:25
 PERSON OR HAVE
A CONVERSATION WITH STAFF,

[Captioner] 20:29:28
 BUT
TO HAVE THIS CRYPTIC THING ABOUT
A RECENT

[Captioner] 20:29:32
 COUNCILMEMBER'S
DELIBERATE ACTIONS AND PUBLIC
VIOLATIONS AND THEN TO SAY THAT


[Captioner] 20:29:35
THIS REFERRAL IS ABOUT DOING A
BROWN ACT TRAINING,

[Captioner] 20:29:39
 IT JUST,
IT'S VERY CONFUSING TO ME.
SO I HOPE MAYBE YOU CAN

[Captioner] 20:29:42
 EXPLAIN
A LITTLE BIT MORE YOUR
MOTIVATIONS AND I ALSO HOPE THAT


[Captioner] 20:29:46
WE CAN DIRECT STAFF TO CHANGE
THE WORDING

[Captioner] 20:29:50
 OF IT SO THAT WE
DON'T HAVE A PERMANENT RECORD OF
SOMETHING THAT IS

[Captioner] 20:29:54
 NOT TRUE, IS
OUT AND OUT FALSE.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:29:59
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
NEXT IS COUNCILMEMBER SHAO.


[Captioner] 20:30:03
>> Councilmember Shao: THANK
YOU, MADAME MAYOR.
I BELIEVE PERSONALLY IT'S

[Captioner] 20:30:06
 THE
RIGHT TIME TO DO THE RIGHT


[Captioner] 20:30:09
THING, BECAUSE ALL I SEE FROM
THIS REFERRAL IS TO STRENGTHEN


[Captioner] 20:30:12
THE TRAINING REGARDING CLOSED
SESSION BROWN

[Captioner] 20:30:15
 ACT
CONFIDENTIALITY REQUIREMENTS.
I

[Captioner] 20:30:19
 RECALL THAT IN THE

[Captioner] 20:30:22
 PAST, THE
LEAKAGE OF CONFIDENTIAL
INFORMATION DURING THE

[Captioner] 20:30:26
 LABOR
NEGOTIATION ACTUALLY REALLY DID
A LOT

[Captioner] 20:30:29
 OF DAMAGE TO THE MUTUAL
INTERESTS OF NOT

[Captioner] 20:30:32
 ONLY THE CITY
EMPLOYEES BUT ALSO THE CITY


[Captioner] 20:30:37
RESIDENTS, AND AS A PERSON THAT
USED TO BE

[Captioner] 20:30:41
 THE SENIOR DIRECTOR
OF QUALITY OPERATIONS IN MY


[Captioner] 20:30:45
COMPANY, I EMPHASIZE TRAINING
AND I

[Captioner] 20:30:48
 NEVER THINK TRAINING IS
ENOUGH.
YOU

[Captioner] 20:30:53
 KNOW, IF SOMEONE CLAIMS THAT
THE TRAINING IS ENOUGH, LOOK AT


[Captioner] 20:30:56
THE RESULT.
AND THAT VIOLATIONS

[Captioner] 20:30:59
 WOULD
INDICATE POOR TRAINING TO SAY
THE LEAST.


[Captioner] 20:31:05
FOR THIS REFERRAL, I THINK WITH
THE START OF THE

[Captioner] 20:31:09
 NEW CITY
COUNCIL, I THINK IT IS THE RIGHT
TIME FOR US

[Captioner] 20:31:12
 TO BE BROUGHT TO THE
SAME PAGE.


[Captioner] 20:31:17
I APPRECIATE COUNCILMEMBER
DESRIE CAMPBELL'S REMARK

[Captioner] 20:31:20
 THAT
THE BROWN ACT BY ITSELF HAS BEEN


[Captioner] 20:31:23
REGULARLY UPDATED, AND IT IS
ESSENTIAL

[Captioner] 20:31:26
 FOR US TO BE ALSO
UPDATED IN OUR

[Captioner] 20:31:29
 TRAINING FOR THE
BROWN ACT.


[Captioner] 20:31:34
FOR THE TECHNICALITY OF THE


[Captioner] 20:31:37
WORDING HERE IN

[Captioner] 20:31:40
 NUMBER ONE, FOR
PREVIOUSLY APPROVED AND FUTURE
CENSURES,

[Captioner] 20:31:43
 I DON'T MIND IF WE ADD


[Captioner] 20:31:47
JUST TWO WORDS, FOLLOW-UP OF
PREVIOUSLY

[Captioner] 20:31:51
 APPROVED AND THE
FUTURE REFERRAL OF 16

[Captioner] 20:31:55
 

[Captioner] 20:31:59
 CENSURES, AND
I THINK IT STILL SERVES THE SAME
PURPOSE, WHICH IS, ONCE

[Captioner] 20:32:02
 AGAIN,
TO REALLY BRING

[Captioner] 20:32:05
 ALERTS TO EACH
AND EVERY CITY COUNCILMEMBER


[Captioner] 20:32:09
WITH REGARD BEING THE
CONFIDENTIALITY

[Captioner] 20:32:13
 REQUIREMENTS.
ENGLISH IS NOT MY FIRST

[Captioner] 20:32:16
 LANGUAGE
AND I LEARNED THE WORD


[Captioner] 20:32:19
CONFIDENTIALITY AND

[Captioner] 20:32:22
 I DON'T SEE
THERE'S ANY OTHER WAY TO TWIST


[Captioner] 20:32:27
THE INTERPRETATION FOR

[Captioner] 20:32:28
 THAT
WORD.
IN OUR INDIVIDUAL CAREERS, WE'RE


[Captioner] 20:32:32
RUNNING TO SO MANY

[Captioner] 20:32:35
 OCCASIONS
WHERE CONFIDENTIALITY IS A MUST,
ESPECIALLY IN

[Captioner] 20:32:38
 THE LEGAL
INDUSTRY.
SO IN THAT

[Captioner] 20:32:42
 CASE, I THINK IT IS
VERY TIMELY,

[Captioner] 20:32:47
 AND APPROPRIATE TO
HAVE THIS

[Captioner] 20:32:50
 REFERRAL FOR THE STAFF
TO ARRANGE FOR

[Captioner] 20:32:54
 TRAINING
REGARDING THE EVER-UPDATING


[Captioner] 20:32:57
BROWN ACT SO THAT EACH AND EVERY
ONE OF US

[Captioner] 20:33:00
 CAN REALLY WORK AS A
TEAM, AND

[Captioner] 20:33:03
 ALSO WILL PREVENT
ANYTHING THAT WOULD

[Captioner] 20:33:07
 HURT THE
MUTUAL TRUST AMONG ALL THE TEAM
MEMBERS.


[Captioner] 20:33:12
SO ONCE AGAIN, I'M SUPPORTIVE TO
THIS REFERRAL,

[Captioner] 20:33:16
 EXCEPT FOR JUST
THE ADDITION OF TWO WORDS.


[Captioner] 20:33:22
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN.


[Captioner] 20:33:29
>> Councilmember Salwan: THANK
YOU, MADAME MAYOR.
AS A STUDENT OF HISTORY, I THINK


[Captioner] 20:33:32
IT WAS BEFORE OUR TIME, I THINK
THERE WAS A BROWN ACT TRAINING
DONE

[Captioner] 20:33:35
 MAYBE IN 2005 OR 6, I DON'T
REMEMBER THE EXACT TIME, BUT I
KNOW SOME OF

[Captioner] 20:33:39
 THE COUNCILMEMBERS
THAT

[Captioner] 20:33:42
 WERE THERE, THERE WAS SOME
KIND OF BROWN ACT ISSUE.
SO

[Captioner] 20:33:45
 I THINK IF EXPLICIT INTENT IS
TO DO BROWN ACT

[Captioner] 20:33:48
 TRAINING, I
THINK THAT'S GREAT, WE SHOULD
DEFINITELY DO THAT, WE SHOULD DO


[Captioner] 20:33:51
THAT ALL THE TIME, BOTH FOR

[Captioner] 20:33:57
CONFIDENTIAL CLOSED SESSION ITEM
AS WELL AS BROWN ACT BECAUSE
THERE'S ALWAYS CONCERNS ABOUT


[Captioner] 20:34:00
COUNCILMEMBERS NOT FOLLOWING THE
BROWN ACT AS FAR AS THE MEETINGS
OR

[Captioner] 20:34:04
 THE COMMUNICATION

[Captioner] 20:34:06
 OR MANY
DIFFERENT THINGS SO IT'S ALWAYS
A GOOD REMINDER TO KEEP US ON


[Captioner] 20:34:10
TRACK, WHAT IT IS, HOW DOES IT
APPLY, HOW CAN WE,

[Captioner] 20:34:13
 AGAIN, BECOME
A BETTER COUNCIL AND

[Captioner] 20:34:16
 IMPROVE OUR
GOVERNANCE.
SO IF THAT'S WHAT THE MAYOR IS


[Captioner] 20:34:20
SEEKING, I AM WHOLEHEARTEDLY
SUPPORTIVE OF THAT.
IT DOESN'T HAVE

[Captioner] 20:34:23
 TO BE ANYTHING
FANCY.
WE COULD PAIR IT WITH OUR


[Captioner] 20:34:28
RETREAT OR SET UP A SESSION AND
I THINK THAT WOULD BE GOOD.


[Captioner] 20:34:32
THE OTHER ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN


[Captioner] 20:34:36
RAISED, I THINK SOUNDS LIKE THE
MAYOR WANTS SOME SORT OF UPDATE
ON THE

[Captioner] 20:34:39
 REFERRALS THAT ARE IN THE
PIPELINES, WHICH MAYBE COULD BE
A SEPARATE ITEM OR I DON'T

[Captioner] 20:34:43
 KNOW
HOW YOU WANT TO HANDLE THAT.
AND

[Captioner] 20:34:46
 I THINK IT'S NOT A BAD IDEA
TO HAVE AN ATTENDANCE

[Captioner] 20:34:51
 CALENDAR
OF COUNCIL MEETINGS.
I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY A GOOD


[Captioner] 20:34:55
THING TO DO ANYWAYS, BUT I DON'T
KNOW IF THAT NEEDS TO BE PART OF
THIS REFERRAL

[Captioner] 20:34:58
 OR THAT'S
SOMETHING SEPARATE THAT I DON'T
KNOW IF

[Captioner] 20:35:00
 THE CITY COUNCIL
MAINTAINS.
I KNOW WE DO THAT FOR EACH


[Captioner] 20:35:03
MEETING, BUT THERE'S MAYBE NOT A
CALENDAR THAT WE UPDATE.


[Captioner] 20:35:07
BUT AS FAR AS THE INTENT OF
HAVING A BROWN ACT TRAINING, I


[Captioner] 20:35:10
THINK THAT'S GREAT.
I WOULD EXPAND

[Captioner] 20:35:14
 TO NOT ONLY
CLOSED SESSION BUT ALSO BROWN
ACT TRAINING IN

[Captioner] 20:35:19
 GENERAL.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
I'M AMIABLE TO THE AMENDMENTS


[Captioner] 20:35:22
THAT ARE BEING ASKED.
COUNCILMEMBER COX.


[Captioner] 20:35:26
>> Councilmember Cox: YES, I
JUST WANTED TO ADD THAT SOME OF
THESE OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS,

[Captioner] 20:35:29
 I
DON'T SEE IT ADDING VALUE

[Captioner] 20:35:33
 WHEN,
ONE, NUMBER ONE RECOMMENDATION
ON CENSURES IS NOT

[Captioner] 20:35:35
 ACCURATE,
NUMBER TWO, COMMUNICATING
MISINFORMATION, WE ALREADY HAD


[Captioner] 20:35:38
TALKED ABOUT SOME OF THIS EVEN
DURING OUR PREVIOUS CITY COUNCIL


[Captioner] 20:35:42
MEETINGS REGARDING DISCUSSION
EVEN

[Captioner] 20:35:47
 WITH OUR COUNCIL HANDBOOK
BACK ON SEPTEMBER 13TH.
AND

[Captioner] 20:35:50
 DISCUSSING ABOUT THE
ABSENCES AT CITY COUNCIL


[Captioner] 20:35:53
MEETINGS, THOSE THINGS ARE
DOCUMENTED IN OUR MEETING
MINUTES ALREADY THAT ARE

[Captioner] 20:35:57

PUBLISHED, YOU KNOW, AS THEY
COME

[Captioner] 20:36:01
 APPROVED AND ROLLED INTO
OUR CONSENT AGENDA

[Captioner] 20:36:04
 FOR NOT ALL
THE MEETINGS BUT THEY BUNCH

[Captioner] 20:36:08
 THEM
TOGETHER AND PRESENT THEM THERE.
SO I THINK THERE'S SOME

[Captioner] 20:36:11
 AREAS
THAT IT'S JUST NOT

[Captioner] 20:36:15
 ADDING VALUE
TO THIS TYPE OF DISCUSSION, AND
THIS IS NOT PURELY TRAINING,


[Captioner] 20:36:18
BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT THE WHOLE
REFERRAL, IT'S NOT JUST

[Captioner] 20:36:21
 A
REFERRAL FOR TRAINING.
THERE'S OTHER THINGS IN THERE


[Captioner] 20:36:25
THAT I WILL NOT BE ABLE TO
ACCEPT THE RECOMMENDATIONS
BECAUSE

[Captioner] 20:36:29
 THEY'RE FALSE, AND SOME
OF THESE THINGS THAT ARE BEING
DISCUSSED,

[Captioner] 20:36:32
 IT'S NOT TRUE.
WE'VE ALREADY DISCUSSED SOME OF
THESE

[Captioner] 20:36:36
 ITEMS AT PREVIOUS CITY
COUNCIL

[Captioner] 20:36:39
 MEETINGS, AND I THINK
IT'S GOING INTO AN OVERBOARD OF
THIS TYPE

[Captioner] 20:36:43
 OF INFORMATION.
IT'S NOT JUST TRAINING, IT'S
MORE THAN THAT.


[Captioner] 20:36:46
AND YOU LOOK AT IT, YOU CAN'T
ACCEPT THE WHOLE THING AS

[Captioner] 20:36:51
 IS,
THEN YOU HAVE TO SAY NO.
IT HAS TO BE ALL OR NOTHING.


[Captioner] 20:36:55
AND IT JUST HAS

[Captioner] 20:36:57
 SOME
INACCURACIES THERE AND THINGS
THAT WE'VE ALREADY DISCUSSED IN


[Captioner] 20:37:01
OUR PUBLIC MEETINGS BACK IN
SEPTEMBER.
AND THE NOTES

[Captioner] 20:37:04
 ARE ALREADY THERE
AS FAR AS THE ABSENCES

[Captioner] 20:37:07
 FROM CITY
COUNCIL MEETINGS, THOSE ARE PART
OF OUR

[Captioner] 20:37:10
 MEETING MINUTES.
SO I JUST WANTED TO JUST MAKE
SURE THAT EVERYBODY IS AWARE

[Captioner] 20:37:13
 OF
THAT.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:37:16
>> Mayor Mei: ACTUALLY I ALSO
WANTED TO COMMENT,

[Captioner] 20:37:19
 ACTUALLY YOU
REFERENCED THE OCTOBER MEETING
AND IT WAS DURING THAT MEETING


[Captioner] 20:37:22
THAT YOU HAD ACTUALLY ASKED
SPECIFICALLY REGARDING THE


[Captioner] 20:37:26
CLARIFICATION QUESTION ON
CENSURES AND WHAT WOULD

[Captioner] 20:37:29
 BE THE
ACTIONS THAT THE COUNCIL

[Captioner] 20:37:32
 COULD
TAKE FOLLOWING UP.
IT WAS YOUR QUESTION ACTUALLY


[Captioner] 20:37:36
THAT I WAS FOLLOWING UP ON, IS
THAT YOU HAD SAID DURING THE


[Captioner] 20:37:39
MEETINGS THAT YOU WANTED TO KNOW
WHAT WERE THE DIFFERENT ACTIONS
AND

[Captioner] 20:37:43
 REMEDIES IN CASE OF
VIOLATIONS.


[Captioner] 20:37:47
AND SO I DON'T KNOW IF CITY
ATTORNEY WOULD BE

[Captioner] 20:37:50
 ABLE TO RECALL
THAT

[Captioner] 20:37:54
 OR --
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: I DON'T
HAVE AN INDEPENDENT RECOLLECTION


[Captioner] 20:37:56
AS OF THIS MOMENT.
I'D HAVE TO GO BACK AND REVIEW.
>> Mayor Mei: SURE.


[Captioner] 20:37:59
>> Councilmember Cox: WE HAVE TO
GO BACK TO OUR MEETING MINUTES
AND LOOK AT THAT PART.


[Captioner] 20:38:02
BUT ALSO THAT THERE WAS MORE

[Captioner] 20:38:05
 TO
JUST TAKING CERTAIN PARTS OUT OF
CONTEXT OF THAT DISCUSSION.


[Captioner] 20:38:08
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE
COUNCIL HANDBOOK AND EVEN


[Captioner] 20:38:12
DEALING WITH THE ORDER OF
PROCLAMATIONS, THERE WAS A LOT


[Captioner] 20:38:15
OF THINGS GOING THROUGH PAGE BY
PAGE AND SECTION

[Captioner] 20:38:18
 BY SECTION ON
THAT.
SO PLEASE DO NOT REPRESENT

[Captioner] 20:38:22
 THAT
I'M HIGHLIGHTING THAT.
IT ALL PART OF

[Captioner] 20:38:24
 UNDERSTANDING THE
WHOLE PICTURE.
>> Mayor Mei: WELL, SPEAKING OF


[Captioner] 20:38:27
UNDERSTANDING THE WHOLE PICTURE,
I WOULD CLARIFY WITH THE CITY
CLERK, I KNOW THAT FOR

[Captioner] 20:38:30
 OUR
COMMISSIONS, WE DO HAVE A CHART
THAT SHOWS THE

[Captioner] 20:38:35
 ATTENDANCE, AND I
DON'T KNOW IF WE'VE EVER HAD ONE
IN THE PAST ALSO

[Captioner] 20:38:39
 FOR --
>> Ms. Gauthier: THE STAFF
LIAISONS, THE SECRETARIES TO THE


[Captioner] 20:38:42
COMMISSION ARE REQUIRED TO
PROVIDE THEIR ATTENDANCE -- THE


[Captioner] 20:38:46
ADVISORY BODY ATTENDANCE TO

[Captioner] 20:38:49
 ME
TWICE PER YEAR, THE JANUARY
THROUGH JUNE AND

[Captioner] 20:38:53
 JULY

[Captioner] 20:38:56
 THROUGH
DECEMBER, AS WE'VE BEEN DOING
THAT FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS, BUT


[Captioner] 20:38:59
I DON'T KEEP A SEPARATE

[Captioner] 20:39:00

CALENDAR.
IT RECORDED IN THE MINUTES.


[Captioner] 20:39:04
I DON'T KEEP A SEPARATE CALENDAR


[Captioner] 20:39:07
FOR THE CITY COUNCIL.
I'M NOT AWARE THAT THE CITY
COUNCIL HAS AN

[Captioner] 20:39:11
 ATTENDANCE
REQUIREMENT AS DO THE ADVISORY
BODIES, WHICH IS WHY I DON'T


[Captioner] 20:39:14
KEEP A SEPARATE CALENDAR.
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY.
I JUST WAS TRYING TO

[Captioner] 20:39:17
 BE IN LINE
WITH THE OTHER COMMISSIONS THAT
I SEE, BECAUSE I

[Captioner] 20:39:21
 KNOW WE'RE IN
THE PROCESS OF LOOKING AT THAT,
SO THAT'S WHY I THOUGHT

[Captioner] 20:39:24
 IT MADE
SENSE.
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN.


[Captioner] 20:39:30
>> Councilmember Salwan: THANK
YOU, MADAME MAYOR.


[Captioner] 20:39:33
MAYBE THIS IS FOR THE CITY
ATTORNEY.
JUST TO CLARIFY THE REFERRAL


[Captioner] 20:39:36
PROCESS, I BELIEVE -- I THINK


[Captioner] 20:39:40
THIS IS LIKE A MEMO FROM

[Captioner] 20:39:43
 MAYOR
MEI.
WHAT WE DO HERE IS NOT DECIDED


[Captioner] 20:39:46
BY WHAT OUR MEMO SAYS.
WE CAN DECIDE WHAT WE


[Captioner] 20:39:48
COLLECTIVELY WOULD LIKE TO MOVE
FORWARD.
IS THAT CORRECT?


[Captioner] 20:39:52
WE DON'T HAVE TO LIKE FOR
EXAMPLE CORRECT THE RECORD, THE
RECORD IS ALREADY

[Captioner] 20:39:54
 THERE.
WHAT SHE'S WRITTEN IS ALREADY
PART OF THE RECORD.


[Captioner] 20:39:58
WE CAN CHOOSE TO MOVE FORWARD
WITH THE ISSUES

[Captioner] 20:40:01
 THAT WE CAN
AGREE ON.
IS THAT CORRECT?


[Captioner] 20:40:03
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: THAT'S
CORRECT.
>> Councilmember Salwan: OKAY.


[Captioner] 20:40:06
SO I DON'T THINK -- IF YOU DON'T
ACCEPT THE PREMISE OF ANY OF


[Captioner] 20:40:09
THESE ITEMS, YOU DON'T HAVE TO
ACCEPT THEM IN YOUR MIND.
WE

[Captioner] 20:40:12
 CAN FORM A MOTION

[Captioner] 20:40:16
 THAT
COUNCILMEMBER DESRIE CAMPBELL
MADE AND

[Captioner] 20:40:19
 AGREE TO THAT.
AND THEN THE OTHER ITEMS, I


[Captioner] 20:40:23
DON'T KNOW HOW -- DO YOU WANT TO
TIE THEM INTO THIS?
>> Mayor Mei: I THINK WE

[Captioner] 20:40:26
 CAN
TAKE THIS ITEM 1ST AND WHEN IT
COMES TO ATTENDANCE, THAT CAN BE


[Captioner] 20:40:29
SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE SEE IN THE
MINUTES BUT I KNOW THAT IT'S
NOT -- I WAS

[Captioner] 20:40:32
 JUST LOOKING AT IT
BECAUSE I'D SEEN THE OTHER
COMMISSION ONES THAT HAD THE


[Captioner] 20:40:34
DETAILS.
SO I WAS TRYING TO BE IN LINE
WITH THE OTHERS.


[Captioner] 20:40:39
SO I THINK WE HAVE A MOTION THAT
WAS

[Captioner] 20:40:41
 MADE --
>> Ms. Gauthier: WE HAVE A
PUBLIC SPEAKER.


[Captioner] 20:40:44
>> Vice Mayor Keng: AND I HAVE
ANOTHER COMMENT.
>> Mayor Mei: SO WE HAD OPENED


[Captioner] 20:40:50
THE PUBLIC COMMUNITY BUT --
>> Councilmember Campbell: I'M
SORRY,

[Captioner] 20:40:54
 MAYOR MEI, CLARIFICATION.
POINT OF ORDER.


[Captioner] 20:40:58
SINCE THE MOTION WAS MADE BY

[Captioner] 20:41:01
 ME,
WILL THERE BE A SECOND SO THAT
WE CAN

[Captioner] 20:41:03
 CONTINUE DISCUSSION
BEFORE WE MOVE ON, PLEASE?
>> Mayor Mei: SURE.


[Captioner] 20:41:06
LET'S MAKE A SECOND.
>> Councilmember Campbell: THANK
YOU.


[Captioner] 20:41:10
>> Mayor Mei: SECONDED BY
COUNCILMEMBER SHAO AND WE'LL
CONDITION OUR

[Captioner] 20:41:12
 DISCUSSION.
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: FOR THE
RECORD, CAN WE JUST CLARIFY THE


[Captioner] 20:41:16
MOTION?
WAS THE MOTION SIMPLY TO DIRECT
STAFF TO ENGAGE --

[Captioner] 20:41:18
 OR ARRANGE
BROWN ACT TRAINING FOR THE CITY
COUNCIL?


[Captioner] 20:41:20
>> Councilmember Campbell: YES,
PLEASE.
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: THANK


[Captioner] 20:41:23
YOU.


[Captioner] 20:41:28
>> Councilmember Cox:[INAUDIBLE


[Captioner] 20:41:33
>> Ms. Gauthier: YOUR MICROPHONE
IS OFF.


[Captioner] 20:41:37
>> Councilmember Campbell: MY
MOTION IS JUST PURELY TO HAVE
BROWN ACT

[Captioner] 20:41:41
 TRAINING AS PART OF
OUR

[Captioner] 20:41:44
 RETREAT.
>> Mayor Mei: THE FOLLOW-UPS,
THERE IS AN ISSUE.


[Captioner] 20:41:47
>> Councilmember Campbell: YES.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:41:51
>> Ms. Gauthier: THE MOTION AS I
HAD IT

[Captioner] 20:41:55
 WAS, COUNCILMEMBER
CAMPBELL'S MOTION WAS TO DIRECT
FOR

[Captioner] 20:41:59
 BROWN ACT TRAINING.
I HAD

[Captioner] 20:42:00
 NOTHING FURTHER.
>> Councilmember Campbell:CORRE
CT.


[Captioner] 20:42:04
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:42:09
>> Mayor Mei: SECONDED BY
COUNCILMEMBER SHAO.
>> Councilmember Shao: THAT IS


[Captioner] 20:42:12
CORRECT.
>> Ms. Gauthier: WE HAVE A
PUBLIC SPEAKER.


[Captioner] 20:42:14
YOU NEED TO OPEN THE PUBLIC
COMMENT PERIOD.
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY.


[Captioner] 20:42:17
I'D LIKE TO OPEN THE PUBLIC
COMMENT

[Captioner] 20:42:22
 PERIOD.
>> Ms. Gauthier: THE SPEAKER IS
A PHONE-IN CALLER WITH THE LAST


[Captioner] 20:42:26
THREE DIGITS OF 919.


[Captioner] 20:42:34
CALLER, YOU NEED TO UNMUTE,
PLEASE.
919.


[Captioner] 20:42:36
>> HELLO?
>> Mayor Mei: YES.
>> HELLO.


[Captioner] 20:42:40
CAN YOU HEAR ME?
OKAY.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:42:43
AND I APOLOGIZE FOR RAISING MY
HAND

[Captioner] 20:42:47
 SO LATE.
I

[Captioner] 20:42:50
 APOLOGIZE.
BUT THANK YOU FOR HEARING ME.


[Captioner] 20:42:56
CITY COUNCILMEMBERS, CITY
ATTORNEY,

[Captioner] 20:42:59
 CITY MANAGER, AND
MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC,
ORIGINALLY

[Captioner] 20:43:02
 I WAS TO COME HERE TO
SPEAK IN REGARD TO THE

[Captioner] 20:43:05
 CITY
POLICY ON HOMELESSNESS, WHICH IS
MITIGATE AND

[Captioner] 20:43:09
 ABATE.
PUT MORE SIMPLY, FIND THE
PROBLEM AND

[Captioner] 20:43:12
 GET RID OF IT.
ATROCIOUS AS IT SOUNDS, THERE

[Captioner] 20:43:15
 IS
SOMETHING MORE ATROCIOUS, MORE
PRESSING, WHICH I WOULD

[Captioner] 20:43:18
 LIKE TO
CALL YOUR ATTENTION.
THE CITY

[Captioner] 20:43:22
 OF FREMONT IS A GENERAL
LAW

[Captioner] 20:43:25
 CITY.
WE

[Captioner] 20:43:28
 FOLLOW THE RULES AND THE
REGULATIONS UNDER

[Captioner] 20:43:31
 CALIFORNIA
GOVERNMENT CODE.
FOR THE PAST SIX YEARS, ELECTORS


[Captioner] 20:43:34
OF THIS CITY HAVE BEEN IGNORED.
THE MEMBERS

[Captioner] 20:43:37
 OF CITY COUNCIL HAVE
USURPED THE WILL OF

[Captioner] 20:43:40
 THE PEOPLE
CONDUCTING BUSINESS WITHOUT
REGARD TO

[Captioner] 20:43:43
 THE COMMUNITY MEMBERS
AS THOUGH WE ARE A

[Captioner] 20:43:47
 CHARTER CITY,
WHICH WE ARE NOT.


[Captioner] 20:43:51
WE AS CITIZENS OF THE CITY

[Captioner] 20:43:52
 OF
FREMONT ARE WHAT MAKES UP THE
ELECTORATE.


[Captioner] 20:43:56
WE ARE THE VOTERS.
LET ME

[Captioner] 20:43:59
 BE CLEAR.
IT IS THE EE ELECTORATE WHICH


[Captioner] 20:44:02
DECIDES WHETHER WE BECOME A
CHARTER CITY, IT IS THE EE
ELECTORATE

[Captioner] 20:44:05
 TO DECIDE WHETHER WE
WANT TO GO TO DISTRICT
ELECTIONS, IT

[Captioner] 20:44:09
 IS THE ELECTORATE
WHO DECIDES WHETHER

[Captioner] 20:44:12
 TO ADD CITY
COUNCIL SEATS.
IT IS THE

[Captioner] 20:44:15
 ELECTORATE TO CREATE A
POSITION OF VICE

[Captioner] 20:44:19
 MAYOR.
IT IS THE ELECTORATE TO DECIDE
WHETHER THE POSITION OF MAYOR IS


[Captioner] 20:44:23
APPOINTED OR ELECTED.
ZIPS

[Captioner] 20:44:26
SINCE THE CITY'S INCORPORATION
THE VOTERS OF THE CITY HAVE


[Captioner] 20:44:30
TWICE VOTED ON THE
AFOREMENTIONED AND TWICE WE
VOTED AGAINST BECOMING A

[Captioner] 20:44:33

CHARTER, WE VOTED AGAINST
BY-DISTRICT

[Captioner] 20:44:36
 ELECTIONS, WE VOTED
AGAINST ADDING

[Captioner] 20:44:40
 ADDITIONAL CITY
COUNCIL SEATS, AND WE

[Captioner] 20:44:43
 VOTED
AGAINST ELECTING A MAYOR.


[Captioner] 20:44:50
>> Ms. Gauthier: TIME IS UP.
THAT WAS THE LAST SPEAKER.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK

[Captioner] 20:44:53
 YOU.
JUST TO CLARIFY, I DO BELIEVE,
AND THERE IS A

[Captioner] 20:44:57
 HISTORY,
CHRONOLOGICAL HISTORY OF OUR
ELECTIONS OUT

[Captioner] 20:45:00
 THERE, THAT DOES
NOT NECESSARILY PERTAIN TO THIS
REFERRAL, BUT THERE WAS

[Captioner] 20:45:03
 A VOTE
TO HAVE DIRECTLY

[Captioner] 20:45:08
 ELECTED MAYORS
AT THAT TIME, THERE WAS A
PREVIOUS VOTE MANY YEARS AGO.


[Captioner] 20:45:13
WE DID NOT VOTE FOR A CHARTER
CITY BUT

[Captioner] 20:45:16
 WE ARE A CITY MANAGER


[Captioner] 20:45:19
FORM LED OF GOVERNMENT.
SO AT THIS TIME, I'M GOING TO
TURN IT BACK TO THE COUNCIL.


[Captioner] 20:45:22
WE HAVE A MOTION AND SECOND,

[Captioner] 20:45:24
 AND
WE'RE TO CONTINUE WITH THE
CONVERSATION.


[Captioner] 20:45:27
I THINK WE HAVE A MOTION AND
SECOND.
SO I'M GOING TO ACTUALLY CALL


[Captioner] 20:45:30
FOR THE VOTE.
, PLEASE.


[Captioner] 20:45:38
>> Councilmember Campbell: MAYOR
MEI, I DON'T HAVE A VOTING
APPARATUS, SO I HAVE TO RAISE

[Captioner] 20:45:41
 MY


[Captioner] 20:45:45
HAND.
OH, THIS?
>> Ms. Gauthier: YES, WE DO.


[Captioner] 20:45:47
WE CHANGED THE NAME.
>> Councilmember Campbell: OKAY,
THANK YOU SO MUCH.


[Captioner] 20:45:54
>> Mayor Mei: WE'LL GIVE A
MINUTE FOR ALBERTO

[Captioner] 20:45:56
 TO --
>> Ms. Gauthier: NO, EVERYBODY
CAN VOTE ON THE DEVICES.


[Captioner] 20:46:00
THE NAME WAS CHANGED.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:46:09
SUE WE'LL FIX IT.
SORRY.
WE JUST NOTICED

[Captioner] 20:46:12
 HER NAME IS
MISSPELLED BUT WE'LL GET THAT
FIXED.


[Captioner] 20:46:15
VICE MAYOR AND COUNCILMEMBER
SHAO NEED TO VOTE.


[Captioner] 20:46:18
>> Councilmember Shao: SURE.


[Captioner] 20:46:25
>> Mayor Mei: SO THE MOTION


[Captioner] 20:46:28
PASSES, 6 AYE AND COUNCILMEMBER
KASSAN VOTING NAY.


[Captioner] 20:46:35
AND --
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: IS THAT
A NAY OR AN ABSTENTION?


[Captioner] 20:46:38
>> Mayor Mei: I'M SORRY, I'M
LOOKING AT THAT AGAIN.
MY APOLOGIES.


[Captioner] 20:46:41
>> Ms. Gauthier: IT WAS AN
ABSTENTION ON MY SCREEN.


[Captioner] 20:46:45
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY.


[Captioner] 20:46:50
>> Councilmember Kassan: YEAH,
BECAUSE I JUST -- I'M -- I HAD
SOME QUESTIONS

[Captioner] 20:46:53
 ABOUT THIS
PROCESS.
I DIDN'T FEEL

[Captioner] 20:46:56
 LIKE I COULD VOTE
YES ON THE MOTION BECAUSE I'M
CONFUSED ABOUT

[Captioner] 20:47:00
 THE RELATIONSHIP
BETWEEN THE MOTION AND THE


[Captioner] 20:47:03
REFERRAL AND I HAD RAISED MY
HAND BUT I WASN'T

[Captioner] 20:47:06
 CALLED ON AND
I WAS WONDERING IF THERE'S -- I


[Captioner] 20:47:10
UNDERSTAND THIS IS PART OF OUR
PERMANENT RECORD FOR THE AGENDA
BUT I

[Captioner] 20:47:13
 AM WONDERING IF THERE'S
ANYTHING THAT CAN BE DONE IN THE
MINUTES

[Captioner] 20:47:16
 TO AT

[Captioner] 20:47:21
 LEAST INDICATE
WHAT WAS DISCUSSED AND THE FACT


[Captioner] 20:47:24
THAT THERE IS AT LEAST ONE THING
THAT'S INCORRECT

[Captioner] 20:47:28
 IN HERE.
SO THAT'S WHY I ABSTAINED,
BECAUSE I'M A LITTLE

[Captioner] 20:47:31
 CONFUSED
ABOUT THIS REFERRAL.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:47:39
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: THE
RECORD IS PERMANENT IN THE SENSE
THAT IT'S AN

[Captioner] 20:47:43
 OFFICIAL CITY STAFF
REPORT.
IT'S NOT

[Captioner] 20:47:46
 A STAFF INITIATED
REPORT.
IT WILL

[Captioner] 20:47:50
 BE IN OUR RECORD AS A
REFERRAL JUST LIKE WE

[Captioner] 20:47:53
 MAINTAIN
ANY OTHER PARTICULAR REFERRAL.
IF A PARTICULAR MEMBER HAS AN


[Captioner] 20:47:56
OBJECTION THAT THE MEMBER WOULD
LIKE THE CITY CLERK TO LODGE,
IT'S OKAY

[Captioner] 20:47:59
 FOR THE MEMBER TO MAKE
THAT OBJECTION AND WE WILL LODGE
THAT

[Captioner] 20:48:03
 OBJECTION IN OUR RECORD.
>> Councilmember Kassan: I WOULD
LIKE THE

[Captioner] 20:48:06
 RECORD -- THE MEETING
MINUTES TO

[Captioner] 20:48:09
 REFLECT THAT ITEM
NUMBER ONE IN THE RECOMMENDATION


[Captioner] 20:48:13
IS INCORRECTLY

[Captioner] 20:48:15
 DESCRIBES A
PREVIOUSLY APPROVED CENSURE.
I DO THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT.


[Captioner] 20:48:21
THAT WAS ACKNOWLEDGED BY STAFF,
THAT THAT IS -- IT

[Captioner] 20:48:24
 NOT CORRECT,
AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT NOT
TO ALLOW THAT

[Captioner] 20:48:27
 TO BE UNADDRESSED.
SO I WOULD REQUEST THAT THAT

[Captioner] 20:48:28
 BE
REFLECTED IN THE MINUTES.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:48:33
>> Mayor Mei: AND I'M FINE WITH
REFLECTING THAT IT WAS NOT A
PREVIOUSLY APPROVED

[Captioner] 20:48:36
 CENSURE, BUT
IT WAS A PREVIOUSLY APPROVED
REFERRAL TO MOVE FORWARD

[Captioner] 20:48:39
 AND TO
PROCESS THAT.
THAT WAS A VOTE AT

[Captioner] 20:48:43
 THAT TIME BY
THE SAID COUNCIL.


[Captioner] 20:48:52
>> Councilmember Campbell: MAYOR
MEI, I'M SORRY AGAIN, POINT OF
ORDER, PLEASE?


[Captioner] 20:48:54
>> Mayor Mei: SURE.
>> Councilmember Campbell: THE
VOTE HAS BEEN CALLED AND


[Captioner] 20:48:57
RECORDED.
>> Mayor Mei: YES.
>> Councilmember Campbell: IS


[Captioner] 20:49:00
THERE ANOTHER PLACE ON THE
AGENDA WHERE WE CAN DISCUSS
FUTURE AGENDA

[Captioner] 20:49:04
 ITEMS AND THAT WAY
MAYBE WE CAN --
>> Mayor Mei: 

[Captioner] 20:49:08
WE DON'T USUALLY
HAVE THAT TYPE OF AGENDA ITEM
BUT

[Captioner] 20:49:11
 IF THERE ARE AGENDA ITEMS
YOU'D LIKE TO DISCUSS, WE'D BE
HAPPY TO TAKE

[Captioner] 20:49:14
 THAT ON AND HAVE
THAT CONVERSATION.
SO THANK YOU SO MUCH.


[Captioner] 20:49:18
>> Councilmember Campbell: I WAS
MORE CONCERNED WITH


[Captioner] 20:49:22
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN BEING ABLE
TO HAVE THAT PART

[Captioner] 20:49:26
 OF THE -- HER
CONCERN AS ANOTHER

[Captioner] 20:49:29
 AGENDA ITEM
OR SOME OTHER ITEM SINCE THIS
ONE HAS BEEN

[Captioner] 20:49:32
 ALREADY MOVED,
SECONDED AND VOTED ON.


[Captioner] 20:49:36
>> Councilmember Kassan: THIS IS
REALLY A SEPARATE ISSUE.


[Captioner] 20:49:39
IT'S JUST BECAUSE THE MEETING
MINUTES ARE BEING TAKEN FOR THIS
MEETING NOW,

[Captioner] 20:49:42
 I THINK IT WOULD BE
GOOD TO ADDRESS NOW

[Captioner] 20:49:45
 WHAT THE
MINUTES REFLECT.
SO I

[Captioner] 20:49:48
 DON'T UNDERSTAND THE
DISTINCTION -- I DON'T
UNDERSTAND THIS IDEA THAT THERE


[Captioner] 20:49:52
WAS A PREVIOUSLY APPROVED


[Captioner] 20:49:54
REFERRAL --
>> Mayor Mei: THERE WAS A
REFERRAL THAT WAS BROUGHT TO THE


[Captioner] 20:49:57
COUNCIL AT THAT TIME, AND THE
COUNCIL VOTED TO MOVE FORWARD
WITH THE

[Captioner] 20:50:01
 REFERRAL, AND SO IT WAS
STILL PENDING THE

[Captioner] 20:50:03
 FEEDBACK AT
THAT TIME FROM THE ATTORNEY'S
OFFICE.


[Captioner] 20:50:07
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: WHAT
CITY STAFF CAN DO, THERE'S A


[Captioner] 20:50:11
COUPLE ISSUES.
ONE IS THE MINUTES WILL REFLECT


[Captioner] 20:50:15
THE OBJECTION.
THE SECOND THING THAT WE CAN DO


[Captioner] 20:50:18
IS TO PROVIDE OFF AGENDA TO THE


[Captioner] 20:50:21
COUNCILMEMBERS JUST A RECORD OF
WHAT OCCURRED ON

[Captioner] 20:50:24
 THE DATE IN
ISSUE, JUST SO COUNCILMEMBERS
CAN REFER TO BOTH

[Captioner] 20:50:27
 THE REPORT,
THE REFERRAL THAT IS AT ISSUE,
AS WELL AS THE MEETING MINUTES


[Captioner] 20:50:30
THAT WILL REFLECT THE COUNCIL
ACTION.
THAT WAY ALL COUNCILMEMBERS HAVE


[Captioner] 20:50:33
A RECORD OF WHAT TOOK PLACE.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
>> Councilmember Kassan: I JUST


[Captioner] 20:50:36
WANT TO BE SURE, I DIDN'T
TOTALLY GET THAT.
SO YOU'RE SAYING THE

[Captioner] 20:50:40
 MEETING
MINUTES FROM THIS CURRENT
MEETING WILL

[Captioner] 20:50:43
 REFLECT WHAT
EXACTLY?
I DIDN'T QUITE CATCH THAT.


[Captioner] 20:50:46
>> Mayor Mei: THE ACTIONS TAKEN.
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: THE
MEETING

[Captioner] 20:50:48
 MINUTES ARE CERTAINLY
GOING TO REFLECT THE COUNCIL'S
ACTION.


[Captioner] 20:50:52
SO THERE WAS A MOTION, THERE WAS
A SECOND, THERE WAS A VOTE.


[Captioner] 20:50:54
THAT MOTION HAD TO DO WITH BROWN
ACT TRAINING, THAT MOVED
FORWARD.


[Captioner] 20:50:59
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN ASKED
WHETHER -- WHAT THE RECORD

[Captioner] 20:51:02
 COULD
REFLECT IN THE MINUTES IN TERMS
OF ACCURACY

[Captioner] 20:51:05
 OF SOME MATERIAL IN
THE REFERRAL, AND WE INDICATED
THAT SHE

[Captioner] 20:51:09
 CAN LODGE AN OBJECTION
AND WE WOULD RECORD THAT FOR THE


[Captioner] 20:51:12
RECORD IN TERMS OF THE MEETING
MINUTES.


[Captioner] 20:51:15
THAT'S NOT A STATEMENT OF THE
COUNCIL, IT WOULD BE A STATEMENT
OF A

[Captioner] 20:51:18
 COUNCILMEMBER THAT WOULD BE
REFLECTED IN THE RECORD.
SEPARATELY, WHAT I'M

[Captioner] 20:51:22
 SUGGESTING
IS WE'RE NOT IN THE -- CITY
STAFF IS NOT IN THE POSITION TO


[Captioner] 20:51:25
COMMENT ON WHAT TOOK PLACE AT A
PRIOR MEETING.
I THINK THE BEST THING THAT WE


[Captioner] 20:51:29
CAN DO IS TO OBTAIN A RECORD OF
WHAT TOOK

[Captioner] 20:51:32
 PLACE AT THE MEETING,
I THINK THAT WE'VE UNDERSTOOD
THAT IT

[Captioner] 20:51:35
 CONCERNS A PRIOR
DISCUSSION ABOUT A POTENTIAL
CENSURE,

[Captioner] 20:51:38
 SO WE CAN PERFORM THAT
RESEARCH AND PROVIDE

[Captioner] 20:51:42
 THE COUNCIL
THE CITY'S OWN RECORD OF WHAT
TOOK PLACE,

[Captioner] 20:51:45
 EITHER STAFF REPORTS
AND MEETING MINUTES THAT REFLECT
THE ACTION THAT

[Captioner] 20:51:48
 TOOK PLACE.
>> Ms. Gauthier: AND WE

[Captioner] 20:51:51
 PROBABLY
HAVE STENOCAPTIONER NOTES AS
WELL FOR THAT PARTICULAR


[Captioner] 20:51:53
MEETING.
>> Mayor Mei: YES.
>> Councilmember Kassan: COULD


[Captioner] 20:51:57
THE STATEMENTS MADE BY STAFF
STATING THAT THERE HAVE NOT BEEN
ANY

[Captioner] 20:52:00
 PREVIOUSLY APPROVED CENSURES
BE ADDED TO THE MINUTES?
I MEAN, IT WAS SAID IN

[Captioner] 20:52:03
 THE
MEETING, CAN THAT BE ADDED TO
THE MINUTES?


[Captioner] 20:52:07
IT'S A STATEMENT MADE BY STAFF.
I DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH IT
BEING A

[Captioner] 20:52:10
 STATEMENT MADE BY ME.
I'M JUST SAYING WHAT STAFF SAID.


[Captioner] 20:52:14
THERE HAVE BEEN NO PREVIOUSLY
APPROVED CENSURES.
THAT'S

[Captioner] 20:52:16
 WHAT STAFF SAID.
SO IT SHOULDN'T BE A STATEMENT
BY ME.


[Captioner] 20:52:20
IT SHOULD BE A REFLECTION OF THE


[Captioner] 20:52:23
CITY'S OFFICIAL POSITION THAT
THERE HAVE BEEN NO PREVIOUSLY


[Captioner] 20:52:25
APPROVED CENSURES.
I DON'T SEE WHAT THE BIG DEAL
IS.


[Captioner] 20:52:29
I MEAN, IT WAS STATED IN THE
MEETING, SO I WOULD LIKE THAT
ADDED TO THE MINUTES.


[Captioner] 20:52:33
THANK YOU.
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: THE
MEETING MINUTES GENERALLY


[Captioner] 20:52:37
REFLECT FINAL COUNCIL ACTION,
BUT

[Captioner] 20:52:40
 CERTAINLY THE COUNCIL CAN
DIRECT CITY STAFF

[Captioner] 20:52:43
 TO INCLUDE
THAT INFORMATION WITHIN THE
MINUTES

[Captioner] 20:52:46
 THEMSELVES.
THEY'RE GOING TO BE REFLECTED IN
OUR OFFICIAL RECORDS IN TERMS OF


[Captioner] 20:52:50
TRANSCRIPTION AND VIDEO.
I SEE NO HARM IN

[Captioner] 20:52:52
 INCLUDING IT IN
THE MEETING MINUTES.
>> Mayor Mei: I HAVE NO PROBLEMS


[Captioner] 20:52:55
WITH THAT AND ALSO THE FOLLOW-UP
ACTION THAT THE STAFF WILL BE


[Captioner] 20:52:58
FOLLOWING UP WITH WHAT HAPPENED
WITH THE PREVIOUS REFERRAL.


[Captioner] 20:53:06
>> Ms. Gauthier: I'LL HAVE TO
PULL THE PREVIOUS

[Captioner] 20:53:09
 MEETING.
I BELIEVE IT WAS JONES'
REFERRAL.


[Captioner] 20:53:12
>> Mayor Mei: IT WAS.
>> Ms. Gauthier: WAS THE
PREVIOUS ITEM.


[Captioner] 20:53:16
I'LL PULL ALL OF THE INFORMATION
AND SHARE IT WITH THE CITY
MANAGER AND CITY

[Captioner] 20:53:20
 ATTORNEY FOR


[Captioner] 20:53:25
DISSEMINATION TO COUNCIL.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU SO MUCH.
AND AT THIS

[Captioner] 20:53:30
 TIME, THE MEETING --
I DON'T THINK WE HAVE ANYTHING
ELSE -- IS

[Captioner] 20:53:33
 ADJOURNED.
SO THANK YOU.
