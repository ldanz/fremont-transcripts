19:07:33 NEXT ON THE
19:07:37  AGENDA THIS EVENING IS OUR CEREMONIAL ITEMS.
WE HAVE QUITE
19:07:40  A FEW THIS EVENING.
I WANTED TO FIRST BEGIN WITH
19:07:44  A PROCLAMATION FOR LUNG CANCER AWARENESS MONTH, AND I
19:07:48  BELIEVE ACCEPTING
19:07:52  THE PROCLAMATION AND SHARING SOME COMMENTS
19:07:55  LATER WILL BE RON FONG
19:07:58 .

19:08:03  WHEREAS, AWARENESS IS LOW THAT LUNG CANCER IS THE #1 CANCER KILLER OF MEN AND WOMEN, AT OVER
19:08:12  131,000 DEATHS PER YEAR; AND WHEREAS, AWARENESS IS LOW THAT LUNG CANCER KILLS TWICE AS MANY WOMEN AS DOES 
19:08:15 BREAST CANCER; AND WHEREAS, AWARENESS IS LOW THAT ANYONE CAN GET LUNG CANCER – YOUNG OR OLD, ATHLETIC OR COUCH
19:08:18  POTATO, RICH OR POOR, SMOKER OR
19:08:32  NON-SMOKER. IF YOU HAVE LUNGS, THEN YOU CAN GET LUNG CANCER; AND WHEREAS, 20% OF THE PEOPLE WHO DIE FROM LUNG 
19:08:35 CANCER NEVER SMOKED, WHICH MEANS AWARENESS IS LOW THAT STOPPING SMOKING ALONE IS INADEQUATE; AND WHEREAS, 
19:08:38 EARLY DETECTION OF LUNG CANCER IS LOW BECAUSE THERE IS NO EASY, AFFORDABLE WAY TO TEST
19:08:45  LIKE A BREATHALYZER, RESULTING IN CANCER BEING DISCOVERED TOO
19:08:48  LATE; AND WHEREAS, OVER 235,000 AMERICANS
19:08:53  ARE STILL DIAGNOSED WITH LUNG CANCER WITH THE GRIM STATISTIC THAT STAGE 4 LUNG CANCER
19:08:58  SURVIVORS AT FIVE YEARS ARE A DISMAL 5%, LARGELY DUE TO LOW
19:09:03  RESEARCH FUNDING; AND WHEREAS, RESEARCH FUNDING FOR FINDING AND TREATING LUNG CANCER
19:09:09  TRAILS FAR BEHIND FUNDING FOR RESEARCH OF OTHER CANCERS; AND
19:09:13  WHEREAS, THERE IS HOPE WITH MORE LUNG CANCER SURVIVORS IN RECENT
19:09:16  YEARS DUE TO DISCOVERIES OF NEW
19:09:20  THERAPIES FOR TREATMENTS LIKE IMMUNOTHERAPY AND TARGETED THERAPIES, THERE IS STILL LOW
19:09:24  AWARENESS THAT LESS THAN HALF OF PATIENTS DON’T SURVIVE ONE YEAR;
19:09:30  NOW, THEREFORE, THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF FREMONT, HEREBY RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE
19:09:33  ONGOING FIGHT AGAINST LUNG CANCER, AND HEREBY PROCLAIM
19:09:36  NOVEMBER TO BE LUNG CANCER AWARENESS MONTH, AND THAT IF YOU
19:09:41  HAVE LUNGS, THEN YOU CAN GET LUNG CANCER.
19:09:46 
AND I'D LIKE TO INVITE RON FONG TO BE ACCEPT
19:09:49 ING OF THIS PROCLAMATION.
AND I SEE
19:09:52  HIS PICTURE IN THE BACK, AND I WANTED TO SAY
19:09:55  THANK YOU.
I HAVE ALSO ONE OF THE WHITE RIBBONS HANG
19:09:58 ING AT CITY HALL IN MY OFFICE
19:10:01  WINDOW.
AND THANK YOU FOR JOINING US.
>> 
19:10:04 THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR.
COUNCILMEMBERS, STAFF
19:10:08  AND THE PEOPLE OF FREMONT.

19:10:11 ON BEHALF OF MY LATE WIFE JOAN, THIS IS
19:10:15  HER PECT, AND THE
19:10:18  PICTURE
19:10:22 , I ACCEPT THIS PROCLAMATION WITH GRATITUDE BECAUSE WE NEED TO
19:10:25  RAISE AWARENESS THAT LUNG CANCER IS THE NUMBER ONE CANCER KILLER
19:10:28  BY FAR THAN ANY OTHER CANCER TYPE.
THIS WHITE RIBBON
19:10:32  THAT'S HERE IS A INITIATIVE, IT'S MADE OUT OF
19:10:35  WOOD, IT'S HAND CARVED BY
19:10:38  INDIVIDUAL LUNG CANCER PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES TO HELP RAISE AWARENESS
19:10:42 , AND WE PRESENTED RECENTLY
19:10:45  COUNCILMEMBER SHAO AND MAYOR MEI
19:10:48  HERE A WHITE RIBBON
19:10:51 .
LUNG CANCER IS OFTEN ASYMPTOMATIC.
SO I WANT TO FOCUS
19:10:55  ON THE FACT THAT WHY DID THEY NOT DETECT IT?

19:10:59 IT'S BECAUSE IT'S OFTEN DISCOVERED BY ACCIDENT.
SO WE NEED TO BE MORE
19:11:02  AWARE THAT
19:11:05  LUNG CANCER CAN EXIST
19:11:09 , EVEN DOCTORS DON'T DIAGNOSE IT VERY WELL BECAUSE THEY SAY YOU DON'T HAVE A
19:11:12  PATIENT PROFILE THAT MAKES YOU HAVE LUNG CANCER.
SO IN THE PROCLAMATION
19:11:15 , WE SAID IF YOU HAVE LUNGS, YOU CAN GET LUNG CANCER.
AND THIS IS
19:11:18  TRUE.
IT DOESN'T MATTER
19:11:21  WHICH PARTY YOU VOTED FOR, IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU'RE ATHLETIC OR
19:11:24  NOT, YOU CAN GET LUNG CANCER.
SO HERE ARE SOME SYMPTOMS THAT YOU MIGHT
19:11:27  EXPERIENCE, AND IF YOU KNOW SOMEBODY WHO'S EXPERIENCING THIS CHRONICALLY
19:11:31  FOR MORE THAN A MONTH,
19:11:35  THEN MAYBE IT'S SOMEBODY YOU SHOULD ASK THEIR
19:11:38  DOCTOR, DO YOU HAVE LUNG CANCER.
DO YOU COUGH UP BLOOD?
BLOOD
19:11:41  IS B, SO THAT'S B FOR BREATH.
R, DO YOU
19:11:44  HAVE REPEATING RESPIRATORY DISEASE LIKE BRONCHITIS
19:11:48 ?
THAT'S R, REPEATING RESPIRATORY.

19:11:52 E, DO YOU HAVE ENDURING OR PERSISTENT
19:11:55  COUGH?
AND YOU KNOW IF YOU HAVE A COUGH FOR A
19:11:58  LONG TIME, IT COULD BE ANYTHING.
IT COULD BE ASTHMA, IT COULD BE ANYTHING
19:12:02 .
OR IT COULD BE SEASONAL ALLERGIES.
BUT IF YOU HAVE A
19:12:05  PERSISTENT ENDURING COUGH THAT'S DEEP, THAT LASTS FOR MONTHS
19:12:08 , THIS COULD BE A SIGN OF LUNG CANCER.
DO YOU HAVE
19:12:11  ACHES?
ALL OF US HAVE ACHES.
BUT DO YOU HAVE
19:12:15  ACHES THAT PERSIST FOR A LONG TIME AND THEY
19:12:18  COME RANDOMLY BECAUSE THEY'RE IN YOUR SHOULDERS OR YOUR
19:12:21  CHEST BONES OR YOUR BACK.
THIS
19:12:24  COULD BE A SIGN THAT LUNG CANCER HAS MIGRATED TO YOUR BONES.
DO YOU
19:12:28  HAVE TROUBLE BREATHING?
DO YOU
19:12:31  HAVE SHORTNESS OF BREATH?
THIS COULD BE A SIGN
19:12:34 .
AND DO YOU HAVE HOARSENESS AND WHEEZING
19:12:37  WHEN YOU TALK OR UNEXPLAINED WEIGHT LOSS OR JUST LOSS
19:12:40  OF APPETITE SUDDENLY?

19:12:44 THIS COULD BE A SIGN THAT YOU HAVE LUNG CANCER.
AND YOU'RE JUST
19:12:47  PLAIN TIRED, YOU CAN'T EXPLAIN IT.
IT'S NOT DAYLIGHT SAVINGS TIME.

19:12:50 IT'S SOMETHING ELSE THAT MAKES YOU CHRONICALLY EXHAUSTED.
ANY ONE OF THESE SYMPTOMS
19:12:54  ALONE ARE SYMPTOMS OF
19:12:57  MANY OTHER DISEASES BUT TOGETHER, THEY MIGHT RAISE AWARENESS IN YOUR
19:13:00  BRAIN THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE LUNG CANCER.
AND ASK YOUR DOCTOR
19:13:03 .
NOW YOUR DOCTOR WILL SAY, HEY, YOU'RE NOT A SMOKER OR,
19:13:07  YOU DON'T HAVE A 30-PACK-A YEAR HISTORY TO
19:13:10  DO A CT SCAN, BUT
19:13:15  -- AND THEY'LL GIVE YOU SOME OTHER DIAGNOSIS, MAYBE PT.

19:13:18 JOAN WAS MISDIAGNOSED.
SHE HAD SYMPTOMS OF FATIGUE, SHE HAD
19:13:21  BONE PAIN, AND SHE HAD POOR APPETITE.
AND AFTER A COUPLE WEEKS
19:13:24  OF  SAYING, OH, YOU NEED TO REST, OR YOU NEED TO DO PHYSICAL
19:13:28  THERAPY, IT WAS TRUE.
I PUSHED AND
19:13:31  ADVOCATED FOR MORE TESTING, BECAUSE IF
19:13:34  YOU DON'T TEST, YOU'RE GUESSING.
AND SO
19:13:38  THEY TESTED AND THEY FOUND OUT SHE HAD LUNG CANCER.
SO I'M AN
19:13:42  ADVOCATE THAT YOU SHOULD BE
19:13:48  -- BE AWARE THAT LUNG CANCER CAN
19:13:51  EXIST IN ANYBODY, THERE SHOULD BE BETTER EARLY
19:13:54  DETECTION AND YOU SHOULD BE AWARE OF THESE SYMPTOMS THAT GIVE YOU THAT,
19:13:57  AND YOU SHOULD BE A FRIEND.
ANYONE WITH LUNG
19:14:00  CANCER, THE MOST PER SE VIF CANCER TYPE OUT THERE THAT KILL
19:14:03 S PEOPLE, THEN YOU SHOULD BE A FRIEND WITH  THEM.
THIS WHITE
19:14:06  RIBBON CAN BE GIVEN OR ASKED FOR BY
19:14:10  ANYBODY WHO
19:14:14  HAS LUNG CANCER.
SO THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THIS PROCLAMATION
19:14:17 , AND
19:14:20  THE OPPORTUNITY TO RAISE AWARENESS ABOUT LUNG CANCER.
THANK YOU.

19:14:25 >> Mayor Mei: I HAVE TO SAY THANK YOU TO YOU AND JOAN,
19:14:28  I'VE KNOWN YOU AND JOAN FOR MANY YEARS AND YOU'VE ALL BEEN A
19:14:32  DEAR FRIEND AND CERTAINLY TO SEE
19:14:35  SO MANY PEOPLE IMPACTED BY LUNG CANCER
19:14:36 .
THANK YOU.
>> THANK YOU.

19:14:39 >> Mayor Mei: NEXT IS A PROCLAMATION FOR BAY AREA
19:14:43  STANDS UNITED AGAINST HATE WEEK.
THAT'S BEGINNING NOVEMBER 14TH THROUGH 20TH
19:14:46 , 2021.

19:14:50 ACCEPTING THE PROCLAMATION AND SHARING SOME COMMENTS WILL BE
19:14:53  ANN PARKS
19:15:01 -COUNCIL.

19:15:08  WHEREAS, POLICIES AND RHETORIC ACROSS THE NATION, HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO DIVIDING COMMUNITIES, SUPPORTING 
19:15:10 BIGOTED VIEWS COMPLIMENTARY TO RACISM, XENOPHOBIA, SEXISM, HOMOPHOBIA, AND ISLAMAPHOBIA; AND WHEREAS, UNCIVIL 
19:15:14 BEHAVIOR AND SPEECH THAT WAS PREVIOUSLY CONSTRAINED, IS NOW BEING MORE OPENLY DISPLAYED IN OUR
19:15:18  COMMUNITIES, AND THE VISIBILITY OF HATE ACTS AND VIOLENT ACTS ACROSS THE UNITED STATES HAS
19:15:24  INCREASED, EVEN IN DIVERSE AREAS LIKE THE BAY AREA; AND WHEREAS, IN 2017, LEADERS AND
19:15:27  COMMUNITY MEMBERS FROM HALF A DOZEN CITIES ACROSS THE BAY AREA
19:15:31  GATHERED TO LAUNCH UNITED AGAINST HATE WEEK, A CAMPAIGN TO
19:15:35  PROTECT OUR DIVERSITY AS A REGION AND TO STOP THE HATE THAT
19:15:39  THREATENS THE SAFETY AND CIVILITY OF OUR COMMUNITIES; AND WHEREAS, UNITED AGAINST HATE
19:15:43  WEEK IS DESIGNED TO BRIDGE
19:15:48  DIVISIONS AND TO BRING COMMUNITIES TOGETHER TO LEARN FROM EACH OTHER, SURFACE LOCAL CONCERNS AND SEEK 
19:15:52 SOLUTIONS TOGETHER; AND WHEREAS, COMPASSIONATE FREMONT, ALONG WITH THE CITY OF FREMONT
19:15:56  HUMAN RELATIONS COMMISSION, SPEARHEADED, PRODUCED, AND
19:16:01  DISTRIBUTED 5000 “FREMONT STANDS UNITED AGAINST HATE” POSTERS
19:16:04  AS PART OF THE JOINT EFFORT TO COMBAT HATE AND FOSTER RESPECT AND INCLUSIVITY; AND
19:16:10  WHEREAS, DURING UNITED AGAINST HATE WEEK – NOVEMBER 14 THROUGH
19:16:18  NOVEMBER 20, COMPASSION FREMONT AND THE CITY OF FREMONT HUMAN RELATION COMMISSION CONTINUE TO SPONSOR, ALONG 
19:16:21 WITH OTHER ORGANIZATIONS, UNITED AGAINST
19:16:24  HATE VIRTUAL ACTIVITIES. NOW, THEREFORE, THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF FREMONT, HEREBY
19:16:30  PROCLAIM THE WEEK OF NOVEMBER 14 THROUGH NOVEMBER 20, 2021, AS
19:16:34  UNITED AGAINST HATE WEEK IN THE CITY OF FREMONT, AND SUPPORTS THE EFFORTS OF COMPASSIONATE
19:16:40  FREMONT, THE TRI CITY INTERFAITH COUNCIL, AND THE HUMAN RELATIONS COMMISSION TO CREATE AN

19:16:56  JUSTICE, AND EQUAL TREATMENT OF
19:17:00  ALL, AND WILL WORK WITH OUR COMMUNITY TO ELIMINATE HATRED AND INTOLERANCE.
19:17:06 
AND I REALLY WANTED TO EXPRESS MY CONCERNS AND SUPPORT FOR
19:17:09  THIS BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT
19:17:12  RIGHT NOW, IN THIS MOMENT, I THINK IT'S BECOME UNFORTUNATELY
19:17:15  VERY EASY FOR PEOPLE IN REMOTE LAND TO GET INTO
19:17:19  COVID COUP AND I WOULD SAY IT'S THE
19:17:23  COWARDESS OF THE KEYBOARD
19:17:26 , PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO EXPRESS HAY
19:17:29  HATRED IN WAYS LESS EXPRESSED IN THE PAST.

19:17:33 THAT'S WHY I'M SO GRATEFUL THAT ANN PARKS
19:17:36 -COUNCIL WILL BE  JOINING OUR CITY COUNCIL WHO DID
19:17:40  ADOPT THIS PREVIOUSLY AND WE HAVE BEEN SUPPORTIVE OF THIS IN MANY
19:17:43  YEARS.
AND I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THAT ENGS
19:17:46  EXPRESSED RIGHT NOW IN THIS MOMENT WHERE
19:17:49  THERE'S SUCH DIVISION ACROSS POLITICAL PARTIES, DIFFERENT
19:17:53  RELIGIOUS VIEWS, DIFFERENT POLITICAL  VIEWS, THAT I WOULD LOVE TO SEE
19:17:56  OUR COMMUNITY FIGHT THE VIRUS NOT JUST OF COVID BUT THE VIRUS OF
19:18:00  HATE AND INTOLERANCE AND RESPECT AND KINDNESS FOR
19:18:03  EACH OTHER IS SOMETHING WE HOPE TO SPREAD.
SO I'M LOOKING
19:18:06  FOR HER ON THE SCREEN.

19:18:13 SO THANK YOU.

>> THANK YOU.

19:18:17 AND COMPASSIONATE FREMONT REALLY WANT
19:18:21  TO LET THE CITY COUNCIL AND THE
19:18:25  HUMAN RESOURCES COMMISSION KNOW HOW MUCH WE APPRECIATE YOUR
19:18:28  SUPPORT, NOT JUST FOR UNITED AGAINST HATE
19:18:31  WEEK, BUT FOR OTHER ACTIVITY THAT WE
19:18:35  SPONSOR THROUGHOUT THE YEAR.
THE
19:18:38  MISSION OF COMPASSIONATE FREMONT IS TO PROMOTE JUSTICE, DIGNITY,
19:18:41  EQUITY, COMPASSION, AND RESPECT
19:18:45 , AND THIS YEAR WE'VE ORGANIZED QUITE A NUMBER OF ACTIVITIES FOR
19:18:49  UNITED AGAINST HATE WEEK.

19:18:52 ACTUALLY WE'VE KIND OF EXPANDED TO
19:18:55  THE LATTER PART OF NOVEMBER.
WE START
19:18:58  ON NOVEMBER THE 13TH WITH A
19:19:02  FILM SHOWING A DOCUMENTARY AND A DISCUSSION
19:19:05 .
IT'S CALLED BOMB HARVEST.
IT
19:19:08  ABOUT A TEAM OF PEOPLE THAT
19:19:12  DETONATE LIVE BOMBS IN
19:19:17  LAOS, AND IT'S GOING TO BE SPONSORED BY THE
19:19:20  DISCOVERY CHURCH, AND IT WILL BE ON SATURDAY,
19:19:23   NOVEMBER 13TH AT 1:30 ON ZOOM.

19:19:27 AND THEN THROUGHOUT THE WEEK
19:19:30 , COMPASSIONATE FREMONT ON OUR FACEBOOK IS ASK
19:19:33 ING PEOPLE TO REIMAGINE
19:19:36  THE FREMONT STANDS UNITED AGAINST HATE
19:19:39  POSTER, TO SUBMIT POETRY
19:19:44 , THAT GIVES THEM
19:19:49  MEANING AND HOPE AND ALSO MAYBE A PLAY LIST THAT GIVES THEM INSPIRATION
19:19:52  TO CONTINUE THEIR FIGHT FOR JUSTICE AND EQUITY
19:19:55 .
AND THEN ON
19:19:59  NOVEMBER THE 20TH, THE EPISCOPAL CHURCH ON DRISCOLL
19:20:02  IS GOING TO HAVE A
19:20:06  LABYRINTH WALK, AND THEN A DISCUSSION
19:20:10  OF WALKING TOGETHER, CURIOSITY, CULTURE
19:20:13  AND PRACTICE.
AND THEN ON NOVEMBER
19:20:17  22ND, THAT'S A MONDAY, THE ANNUAL
19:20:21  INTERFAITH THANKSGIVING SERVICE WILL BE
19:20:24  HELD.
THIS WILL BE A ZOOM MEETING.

19:20:32 IT'S CALLED MAKING A HOME TOGETHER.
AND WE THOUGHT THIS WAS REALLY
19:20:36  IMPORTANT BECAUSE OF ALL THE AFTER GUANINE
19:20:39  AFGHANI
19:20:43  REFUGEES THAT WILL BE COMING TO OUR AREA AND WE THOUGHT THIS WOULD BE
19:20:46  AN IMPORTANT THING TO EMPHASIZE.
OUR LAST ACTIVITY IS ON NOVEMBER THE
19:20:50  29TH.
IT'S A CANDLELIGHT VIGIL.
IT WILL BE OUTDOORS
19:20:53 , MASKS WILL BE REQUIRED, AND IT'S AT  ST. JAMES
19:20:57  EPISCOPAL CHURCH.
AND
19:21:00  IT IS GOING TO BE MEMORIALIZING
19:21:03  ALL THE UNHOUSED
19:21:06  CITIZENS THAT HAVE DIED THIS
19:21:10  YEAR.
BECAUSE OF EXPOSURE
19:21:13 .

19:21:17 SO THEY WOULD LIKE YOU TO BRING SOME CANNED GOODS FOR THEIR FOOD DRIVE.
SO THAT
19:21:20  WILL WRAP UP A LOT OF THE ACTIVITIES AND WE ARE ALSO
19:21:23  GOING TO HAVE
19:21:27  -- THE FREMONT LIBRARY HAS BEEN VERY  SUPPORTIVE, AND THEY'RE GOING
19:21:30  TO HAVE A DISPLAY OF BOOKS THAT PEOPLE CAN READ THAT
19:21:34  WILL ADDRESS THIS ISSUE.
SO THANK YOU AGAIN
19:21:37  FOR YOUR SUPPORT.

19:21:43 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU SO MUCH, ANN, FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO JOIN IN OUR COMMUNITY'S
19:21:47  SUPPORT FOR RESPECT

GOOD EVENING, EVERYONE.
I WOULD LIKE TO THANK MAYOR

19:25:43  FREMONT CITY COUNCILMEMBERS FOR INVITING ME HERE TO ACCEPT THIS RECOGNITION
19:25:46  ON
19:25:50 .
I'M ONE OF THE FIVE ELECTED
19:25:53  SUPREME COUNCILMEMBERS.
I'M ALSO SERVING
19:25:56  AS GENERAL SECRETARY.
A LITTLE BIT ABOUT MYSELF
19:26:00 .
I'VE BEEN HERE IN SILICON VALLEY SINCE
19:26:03  1992, WORKING IN ELECTRONIC DESIGN AND
19:26:06  DEVELOPMENT.
I'VE BEEN MANNABLING ENGINEERING DEVELOPMENT TEAMS
19:26:10  FOR THE LAST 12 YEARS
19:26:13 .
WHEN THE PANDEMIC HIT, OUR TEAM BRAINSTORMED
19:26:16  WHAT ARE THE AREAS WE COULD HELP IN MOST EFFECTIVELY.
WE START
19:26:19 ED WITH DISTRIBUTING OF FREE GROCERIES TO ALL COMMUNITIES
19:26:22 , IN FACT, MORE FOLKS FROM OTHER COMMUNITIES
19:26:25  CAME THAN OUR OWN CONGREGATION, AND WE WERE HAPPY TO SERVE THEM.

19:26:29 THIS ALSO INCLUDED FREE HOT  PACKED MEALS TO GO.

19:26:32 THIS CAME NATURALLY TO US BECAUSE WE
19:26:35  RUN A FREE KITCHEN SEVEN DAYS A WEEK, 365 DAYS
19:26:39  A YEAR.
WE THEN EXPANDED DISTRIBUTION
19:26:42  OF FREE MEALS TO FIRST RESPONDERS AT VARIOUS HOSPITALS
19:26:45  AND OTHERS WHO REQUESTED IT FOR THEIR  STAFF.

19:26:50 THEN WITH PPE EQUIPMENT

19:26:57  BEST WE COULD WITH ESSENTIAL SUPPL
19:27:00 IES, THIS INCLUDES VARIOUS HOSPITALS,
19:27:03  MEDICAL SUPPLIES AND FIRE DEPARTMENTS.
LASTLY
19:27:06  IF WE REALLY WANTED TO HELP OUR OVERALL COMMUNITY,
19:27:09  WE NEEDED TO HELP WITH DELIVERY OF VACCINES.
I'M PROUD TO SAY
19:27:13  WE HELPED  20-PLUS VACCINE DRIVES ON THE WEEKENDS FOR
19:27:16  MONTHS ALLOWING US TO ISSUE MORE THAN 10,000 VACCINE DOSES
19:27:19 .
THIS TOOK A LARGE TEAM OF VOLUNTEERS FOR MANY
19:27:22  WEEKENDS BUT WE NEVER FELT SHORT-HANDED.
IT'S A TESTAMENT
19:27:26  TO THE CONGREGATION THAT WANTED TO HELP THEIR
19:27:29  FELLOW AMERICANS.
THIS STEMS FROM THREE BASIC TENETS OF
19:27:32  SIKHISM WHICH IS TO SERVE HUMAN
19:27:35 ITY, MEDITATION, GOD AT ALL TIME,
19:27:39  AND HONEST LIVING AND GIVE BACK.
THOUGH WE ARE
19:27:42  HAPPY TO RECEIVE THIS RECOGNITION, THIS IS IN OUR
19:27:45  DNA AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO SERVE THE COMMUNITY THE BEST WE CAN
19:27:48  GOING FORWARD.
SIKHS HAVE A LONG, RICH HISTORY STRIVING TO
19:27:52  IMPROVE WHATEVER COMMUNITY THEY RESIDE IN.
OUR HOLY DOCTRINE
19:27:55  EMPHASIZES TO RECOGNIZE THE HUMAN RACE AS ONE, SINCE
19:27:58  WE ALL CAME FROM THE SAME SOURCE.

19:28:03 MANY OF YOU MAY HAVE HEARD OF THE ONGOING FORM OF
19:28:06  PROTEST OVER THE PAST YEAR.

19:28:09 THOUGH THESE AFFECT FARMERS ALL OVER INDIA,
19:28:12  THE PROTEST WAS SPEARHEADED BY SIKHS BECAUSE WE STAND
19:28:15  FOR TRUTH AND JUSTICE.

19:32:14 >> GOOD EVENING, IN
19:32:17  MY OHLONE
19:32:20  LANGUAGE.
AGAIN, MY NAME IS ANDREW GALVAN
19:32:23 , I'M AN OHLONE MAN INDIGENOUS TO
19:32:26  THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY REGION.
I'M PLEASED TO ACCEPT THIS ACKNOWLEDGMENT
19:32:30  PROCLAMATION IN HONOR OF NATIVE AMERICAN HERITAGE
19:32:33  MONTH, AND ESPECIALLY WITHIN THE CITY OF FREMONT
19:32:36   HONORING THE OHLONE INDIANS.

19:32:43 I WOULD LIKE TO WELCOME YOU TO FREMONT, WHOSE
19:32:46  OHLONE NAME IS  ORES
19:32:49 ONG.
I WOULD HAVE LIKED TO BE THERE AT THE MEETING TO GREET YOU
19:32:52  IN PERSON, BUT SOMETIMES LIFE TAKES SUDDEN
19:32:56  TURNS WITHOUT USING ITS TURN SIGNAL.

19:32:59 THE PRESENT COVID-19 PANDEMIC
19:33:03  CERTAINLY UNDERSCORES THE TRUTH OF THAT STATEMENT.

19:33:07 CONTAGIOUS DISEASE IS NOTHING NEW
19:33:11  TO THE PEOPLE OF ORESONG.

19:33:14 DURING THE MEASLES EPIDEMIC IN THE YEAR 1806, THE
19:33:18  INDIAN POPULATION AT MISSION SAN JOSÉ
19:33:21  WAS 850.
IN THREE DAYS
19:33:24 , IN LATE 1806,
19:33:29  343 INDIANS DIED FROM THE MEASLES.
I
19:33:32  REPEAT, CONTAGIOUS DISEASE IS NOTHING
19:33:36  NEW TO THE PEOPLE OF ORE
19:33:40  ORESONG, MODERN DAY FREMONT.

19:33:43 IT IS MY HOPE THAT THROUGH THIS RECOGNITION
19:33:47 , AND BY RECOGNIZING
19:33:50  NOVEMBER AS NATIVE AMERICAN HERITAGE MONTH, WE LEARN THAT WE
19:33:53  OHLONES ARE HERE STILL.

19:33:56 WE WANT ALL OF YOU TO LEARN ABOUT THE
19:34:00  ENDURING STRENGTH OF THE OHLONE CULTURE
19:34:05  IN HONEST AND AUTHENTIC WAYS.
NEXT
19:34:08  MARCH, 2022, WILL MARK THE
19:34:11  250TH ANNIVERSARY SINCE THE SPANISH
19:34:15  MISSIONARIES AND  SOLDIERS ARRIVED
19:34:18  HERE IN ORESONG AT THE
19:34:21  CURRENT LOCATION OF MISSION SAN JOSÉ
19:34:24  AS THEY WALK NORTH TOWARDS OAKLAND
19:34:27  AND LAKE MERIT.

19:34:31 LIFE DURING THE MISSION AND RANCHO PERIODS
19:34:34  WAS NOT EASY FOR MISSION PEOPLE.
FOR NATIVE PEOPLE.

19:34:38 IT IS THERE THAT MY OWN VERY
19:34:41  ANCESTORS WORKED.
IN THIS PLACE
19:34:45 , OHLONE
19:34:52  INDIAN PEOPLE WERE WORKED HARD BY THE SPANISH MILITARY, AND THEY COULD NOT
19:34:55  LEAVE IF THEY WANTED TO.
AMOUNTING
19:34:59  TO SLAVERY.
AT MISSION
19:35:03  SAN JOSÉ, THE VERY LANGUAGE I GREETED YOU
19:35:06  IN WAS SUPPRESSED.
HOWEVER, OUR
19:35:09  ANCESTORS REFUSED TO GIVE UP THE THINGS THEY CAR
19:35:12 ED FOR.
WHILE
19:35:15  WE CANNOT CHANGE THE HISTORY
19:35:19  OF COLONIZATION HERE IN CALIFORNIA,
19:35:22  WE CAN TELL AN HONEST STORY THAT
19:35:25  BRINGS DIGNITY AND PRIDE TO OUR COMMUNITY.

19:35:30 ONCE AGAIN, I WELCOME YOU TO THE
19:35:33  OHLONE VILLAGE OF ORESONG,
19:35:37  AND AS MY LATE FATHER
19:35:40  WOULD SAY, YOU CAN STAY HERE ON ONE CONDITION
19:35:44 :  THAT YOU WERE GOOD.

19:35:52 MY HEART IS GOOD.
THANK YOU.

19:35:55 THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THIS RECOGNITION AND
19:35:59  PROCLAMATION.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU,
19:36:02  ANDY, ANDREW GALVAN.

19:36:08  BE VIRTUAL, ON  NOVEMBER 22ND.

19:36:11  WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT THAT FREMONT HAS BEEN BLESSED TO HAVE SOME OF THE
19:36:14  ARTIFACTS OF THE OHLONE, AS WELL
19:36:17  AS NATIVE AMERICAN STUDIES PROGRAM XZ

19:36:30  TUTORING CENTER WHICH IS AVAILABLE AND OPEN ON TUESDAYS AND THURSDAYS, AS WELL AS THERE'S
19:36:33  A CULTURE CLASS.
THEY HAVE A DREAM CATCHER NEWSLETTER, AND I'LL
19:36:36  BE HAPPY TO SHARE THAT.
BECAUSE WE WANTED TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE
19:36:40  TO BE WITH THEIR ARTIFACTS.
AS I UNDERSTAND, THERE'S
19:36:43  A BELIEF THAT BEING WITH YOUR ANCESTORS IN THE SPIRIT
19:36:46  OF THE ARTIFACTS, IT HELPS
19:36:49  TO, I GUESS, ENCOURAGE LEARNING AND ALSO OVER
19:36:52  THE YEARS, ANDY, I KNOW WE'VE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY
19:36:56  TO SHARE POW-WOWS, WHETHER
19:36:59  IT'S AT THE EAST BAY REGIONAL PARKS AS WELL AS AT THE ADULT SCHOOL.

19:37:03 SO I LOOK FORWARD TO THE CONTINUED LEGACY
19:37:06  AND ABILITIES FOR OUR COMMUNITIES TO HONOR AND RECOGNIZE THE
19:37:09  DEPTH, THE BREADTH OF THE HAIR
19:37:12  HERITAGES WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO SHARE.

19:40:46  OF FILIPINO AMERICANS IN THIS COUNTRY, AND I
19:40:50  EMPHASIZE IT'S NOT THE HERITAGE OF FILIPINO
19:40:54 S IN THE PHILIPPINES, BUT OUR HISTORY
19:40:58  HERE IN THIS COUNTRY.
I HAVE A STORY

19:41:18  VERY FEW OF THOSE STORIES INCLUDED PEOPLE OF COLOR OR MINORITIES OR

19:42:15  AMERICA.

19:42:24 I RECENTLY WATCHED AS THE WHITE HOUSE HOSTED A DAY LAST
19:42:27  WEEK THURSDAY TO RECOGNIZE FILIPINO AMERICAN HISTORY

19:43:06 AND IT SPEAKS TO THE IMGRANT STORY
19:43:09  IN AMERICA THAT
19:43:14  THE CHILD OF AN IMMIGRANT CAN RISE TO BE THAT PERSON
19:43:17  IN THE CABINET.

19:43:22 IT'S EVERY IMMIGRANT'S STORY, TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH, AND IT REALLY IS
19:43:25  THE STORY OF WHAT WE SEE IN THE VALLEY THAT
19:43:28  YOU CAN RISE ABOVE
19:43:33  ABOVE YOUR FAMILY'S STORY THAT THE IMMIGRANT
19:43:36  STORY IS A POWERFUL ONE.

19:43:39 SO WITH THAT,
19:43:44  WITHOUT SAYING MUCH MORE, OUR
19:43:47  STORY HERE IN FREMONT AS WE WELCOME OUR
19:43:51  REFUGEES FROM AFGHANISTAN, AND
19:43:54  WE WELCOME NEW IMMIGRANTS EVERY DAY
19:43:57 , WE HAVE STRONG
19:44:01  ARMS TO WELCOME
19:44:04  THESE POPULATIONS EVERY DAY,
19:44:07  AND YOU KNOW, I THINK IT WAS
19:44:10  ANN WHO SPOKE ABOUT
19:44:14  THE RACISM, THE HATRED
19:44:19  THAT OFTEN ACCOMPANIES NEW POPULATIONS COMING IN
19:44:22  TO OUR COMMUNITY, AND I HAVE OFTEN FELT
19:44:25  THIS AS I GREW UP, I MEAN, I'M
19:44:29  AMERICAN-BORN, BUT WHO OF US HAVE NOT BEEN SUBJECTED TO SOME
19:44:32  FORM OF HATRED IN OUR TIME HERE.

19:44:36 AND IT IS TO OUR
19:44:40  CREDIT THAT THIS COUNCIL
19:44:43  AND THIS GROUP OF PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT IT.
I'M
19:44:46  A RETIRED DIVERSITY
19:44:51  PROFESSIONAL, AND I MUST SAY BACK IN THE 90s
19:44:54 , THE CITY OF FREMONT HIRED ME TO
19:44:57  DO THE DIVERSITY TRAINING
19:45:00  FOR THE CITY OF FREMONT EMPLOYEES.
AND
19:45:04  I'M VERY PROUD OF FREMONT THAT THEY
19:45:07  WERE AHEAD OF THE CURVE AT THAT TIME.

19:45:11 I DID THE TRAINING FOR THE
19:45:15  POLICEMEN AND THE FIREMEN AND ALL OF THE EMPLOYEES, AND YOU
19:45:19  WERE --
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU SO MUCH.
>>  --
19:45:22  AHEAD OF THE CURVE.
THANK YOU FOR RECOGNIZING YOUR DIVERSE POPULATION
19:45:25 .
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU FOR BEING PART OF OUR HISTORY AND OUR LEGACY
19:45:29  OF RESPECTING AND HONORING SO MANY CULTURE
19:45:32 S AND ESPECIALLY FOR BEING THE LEGACY OF THE FILIPINO
19:45:36  COMMUNITY.
SO I JUST WANTED TO THANK YOU AND WE'RE SO DELIGHTED THAT YOU
19:45:39  ARE PART OF THE CITY OF  FREMONT'S HISTORY, AND THAT WE
19:45:43  ARE SO DEEPLY HONORED TO CONTINUE TO RECOGNIZE.

19:45:46 THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS I WAS GOING TO MENTION IN CLOSING THIS EVENING.

19:45:49 WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT AT OUR COUNCIL RETREAT, IS THAT WITH SO MANY
19:45:52  DIFFERENT CULTURE AND HERITAGES, IT WOULD BE GREAT TO BE ABLE TO
19:45:55  CREATE THE MASTER CALENDAR SO THAT WE CAN TRY TO PLAN SOME
19:45:58  OF THIS, BECAUSE WE HAVE SO MANY CULTURES
19:46:02  AND HERITAGES AND FAITHS THAT ARE PART OF THIS FABRIC
19:46:05  THAT MAKES FREMONT SO RICH.
AND WE'VE CELEBRATED MANY OF THOSE
19:46:08  WITH YOU AND AS ANDY G
19:46:12  GALVAN MENTIONED, WE'VE CELEBRATED MANY OF THEM
19:46:15  IN PERSON AT DIFFERENT EVENT, SO WE'LL TRY TO COALESCE SOME OF
19:46:18  THAT TOGETHER, BECAUSE WE HAVE SO MUCH TO ENJOY AND TO RESPECT.
THANK YOU
19:46:21  AGAIN FOR YOUR TIME.

19:46:24 NEXT ON OUR CALENDAR WILL BE A CONSIDERATION OF
19:46:28  THE ITEMS THAT WERE PULLED FROM THE CONSENT CALENDAR.

19:46:33 >> Ms. Gauthier: EXCUSE ME, MADAME MAYOR, WE GO TO PUBLIC COMMUNICATIONS BEFORE WE
19:46:36  DO CONSENT.
>> Mayor Mei: YES, THANK YOU.
I JUST NPTS
19:46:39  NOTICED THAT.
SO LET'S GO BACK TO ORAL COMMUNICATIONS
19:46:42 .

19:46:47 THESE ARE FOR ITEMS THAT ARE NOT AGENDIZED THIS EVENING
19:46:50  ON THE CONSENT CALENDAR.
SO I
19:46:54  SEE THREE HANDS FOR ITEM
19:46:57 S NOT AGENDIZED ON THE CALENDAR.
WE'LL BEGIN
19:47:00  WITH KELLY ABREU.
WELCOME.
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

19:47:03 THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE EAST BAY REGIONAL PARK DISTRICT TODAY APPROVE
19:47:06 ED A 25-YEAR LEASE AT MISSION PEAK.
THE BOARD INSERTED
19:47:10  SPECIFIC PROVISIONS IN THE CONTRACT
19:47:13  TO PROTECT AGAINST ANOTHER
19:47:16  CITY SHUT DOWN OF THE PARK.
THE
19:47:20  ANIMUS OF LOCAL HOME OWNERS WAS AGAIN IN EVIDENCE
19:47:23  TODAY.
THEY ASKED FOR FURTHER RESTRICTIONS AT THE PARK.

19:47:27 ONE CLEVER IDEA WAS A TALL FENCE WITH AUTOMATED LOCKING
19:47:31  GATE.
THIS KIND OF PRISON FENCING WAS ALREADY INSTALL
19:47:35 ED EARLIER THIS YEAR AT VARGAS
19:47:39  PLATEAU REGIONAL PARK.
IT LASTED A FEW WEEKS
19:47:43  AND A FEW WEEKS LATER, IT HAD TO BE TAKEN DOWN
19:47:46  BECAUSE LOCAL NEIGHBORS, THE RESIDENTS
19:47:49  NEARBY WERE VERY,
19:47:52  VERY UNHAPPY, VERY DISPLEASED WITH THIS KIND OF PRISON FENCING
19:47:56  IN ONE OF THEIR PARKS, AND THEY UNDERSTOOD THE
19:47:59  BAD  RAMIFICATIONS.

19:48:02 SO THE VARGAS PLATEAU, I CAN ASSURE YOU, IS A VERY
19:48:06  NICE PARK, AND IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY PRISON FENCING, AS IS
19:48:09  BEING PROPOSED FOR MISSION PEAK.
THE LOCAL RESIDENTS WHO
19:48:13  LIVE IN HOMEOWNER ASSOCIATIONS RIGHT NEXT DOOR TO MISSION PEAK
19:48:17  ALSO SPOKE IN GREAT DETAIL WITH PROFESSIONAL GEOLOGIST
19:48:20 S ABOUT THE GEOLOGICAL HAZARDS, THE
19:48:23  FLOODS, THE
19:48:27  MUDSLIDES OF THE
19:48:30  CREEK, THE DAMAGE THAT COULD HAPPEN TO NEIGHBORING  PROPERTIES, AND OF COURSE WE
19:48:33  ALL KNOW THAT THOSE GEOLOGICAL HAZARDS HAVE BEEN HERE FOR A THOUSAND
19:48:38  YEARS OR MORE.
THE HAZARDS ARE THE SAME NO MATTER
19:48:41  WHO OWNS LEGAL TITLE TO THE LAND,
19:48:44  AND THE CITY, WE ALL
19:48:48  KNOW, THE CITY PERMITTED CONSTRUCTION OF HUNDREDS OF HOUSES
19:48:51  IN DEVELOPMENTS LINING THE FOOTHILLS OF THE
19:48:54  PARK OR THE BOTTOM SLOPES OF THE
19:48:58  PARK, YOU KNOW, A FEW DECADES AGO.

19:49:01 SO THE PARK DISTRICT SEEMS TO BE SCAPEGOATED FOR
19:49:04  THE GEOLOGICAL FEARS OF THESE PROPERTY OWNER
19:49:08 S.
LET'S NOT PASS THE LIABILITY ON TO
19:49:11  THE LEASEHOLDER AT THE PARK.
LET'S RECOGNIZE
19:49:15  THAT THE GEOLOGY IS WHAT IT IS,
19:49:18  AND THE LEASEHOLDER IS NOT RESPONSIBLE
19:49:21  FOR THE GEOLOGICAL HAZARDS.
JUST BEFORE THE CITY SHUT DOWN
19:49:24  THE PARK IN 2020, THE CITY PROHIBITED POLITICAL
19:49:27  PAMPHLETS NEAR MISSION PEAK.
THIS WAS SYMPTOMATIC OF
19:49:31  THE CITY'S INTOLERANCE AND POLITICAL
19:49:34  SUPPRESSION, A TYPE OF PARANOIA
19:49:38 , PROMULGATED UNDER THE CLOAK OF OFFICIAL
19:49:41  AUTHORITY.
THE CITY NOW NEEDS TO ADOPT A BALANCED APPROACH
19:49:45  TO GOVERNANCE.
THE INSTALLATION OF A NEW CITY
19:49:48  MANAGER AND A NEW POLICE CHIEF PROMISE TO BRING
19:49:51  MUCH NEEDED CHANGE THROUGH SOUND GOVERNANCE
19:49:55  THAT CONSIDERS THE NEEDS AND THE HEALTH NEEDS AND THE
19:49:58  PARK VISITING NEEDS OF THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY.
THANK YOU
19:50:02 .
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
THE NEXT
19:50:06  SPEAKER ON THIS
19:50:09  IS -- I THINK IT WAS BLAIR BEEKMAN.

19:50:16 >> HI.
BLAIR BEEKMAN HERE.

19:50:21 THANKS FOR YOUR MEETING TONIGHT.
THAT WAS A
19:50:24  VERY GOOD PUBLIC COMMENT TIME OR
19:50:27  ANNOUNCEMENTS TIME, ANNOUNCEMENTS AND PROCLAMATION TIME.

19:50:31 I WANTED
19:50:34  TO -- I GUESS, YOU  KNOW, I'VE BEEN LEARNING HOW TO PLAQUE TIS THIS
19:50:38  PRACTICE THIS MONTH HOW TO SPEAK AT PUBLIC
19:50:41  COMMENT TIME ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF PUBLIC
19:50:45  PUBLIC MASK USE WITH THE UPCOMING HOLIDAYS
19:50:48 .
THERE'S BEEN REPORTS THAT IN ENGLAND AND IN RUSSIA, I
19:50:51  GUESS THE U.K. AND IN RUSSIA,
19:50:54  IT BEING REPORTED THAT COVID IS ON THE RISE AGAIN.

19:50:58 AND IT JUST TO ME WAS VERY MUCH OF A SIGN
19:51:01  THAT ABOUT A MONTH AND A HALF, TWO MONTHS LATER, IT WILL
19:51:04  BE IN FULL SWING BACK HERE IN THIS COUNTRY
19:51:07 .
SO IT SEEMS IMPORTANT TO CONTINUE THE MASK
19:51:10  USE, EVEN THOUGH THINGS ARE BEING, YOU KNOW
19:51:14 , LESSENED A BIT.
BUT YOU KNOW, IT'S WITH
19:51:18  THE GOOD PRACTICES AND THE FACT THAT WE'RE STARTING TO CONSIDER THE
19:51:22  VACCINE PROCESS FOR THE 5 TO 12-YEAR-OLD SET, I
19:51:25  HOPE WE CAN MAKE THE ATTEMPTS TO MAKE
19:51:28  JUST THE VACCINE PROCESS JUST MORE AND MORE
19:51:31  OPEN AND CLEAR FOR OURSELVES.
WHAT EXACTLY IS
19:51:34  IT ABOUT?
IT'S PLUSES, IT'S MINUSES
19:51:37 , OUR LIFESTYLE CHOICES FROM THE VACCINE
19:51:42 .
THESE ARE IMPORTANT SUBJECTS TO ME, AND YOU KNOW THE WORK THAT I DO WITH
19:51:45  OPEN PUBLIC POLICIES WITH
19:51:49  SURVEILLANCE AND TECHNOLOGY CAN REALLY HELP
19:51:52  FACILITATE AN HONEST, DECENT CONVERSATION ABOUT THIS SUBJECT MATTER.

19:51:55 SO GOOD LUCK HOW WE MOVE FORWARD WITH THESE THINGS,
19:51:59  AND HOPEFULLY THAT'S WHAT WE ALL CAN BE WORKING ON THIS NOVEMBER
19:52:03 .
I WANTED TO QUICKLY OFFER THAT THE
19:52:06  MTC HAS BEEN WORKING ON -- THEY'VE COME THROUGH WITH
19:52:09  KIND OF THEIR 2050 PLAN, HOUSING PLANS
19:52:12 , I THINK.
PEOPLE ARE PROUD OF IT, THEY'RE HAPPY WITH IT.

19:52:15 I HOPE YOU CAN GIVE CARE AND ATTENTION, YOU KNOW
19:52:18 , WE HAVE PLANS FOR
19:52:22  2030 TO REALLY BEGIN THE CONCEPTS OF MIXED INCOME IDEAS IN
19:52:25  LOCAL NEIGHBORHOOD HOUSING DEVELOPMENT.
WHY NOT BEGIN TO START
19:52:28  THAT PROCESS NOW?
I THINK IT OFFERS AN INCREDIBLE
19:52:32  FLEXIBILITY IN HOW TO TALK ABOUT THE FUTURE
19:52:38  OF REALLY AFFORDABLE HOUSING.
IF WE START
19:52:42  PLANNING THOSE NOW, THAT CAN PREPARE US FOR THIS NEXT
19:52:45  DECADE.
AND I THINK
19:52:49  US AN INCREDIBLE
19:52:53  ARRAY OF HOW WE CAN WORK BETTER.
AFFORDABLE HOUSING BASED ON
19:52:56  ELI AND VLI USING MIXED INCOME, THAT CAN
19:52:59  SUPPORT AND LIVE WITH MORE HIGHER MIDDLE INCOME
19:53:02  LEVELS AND LOW INCOME LEVELS OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING.
WE CAN
19:53:05  PUT THEM ALL TOGETHER.
IT ISN'T SO
19:53:08  SO HARD OF A FEAT.
I KNOW YOU GUYS
19:53:11  TALK ABOUT IT OFTEN, I HOPE WE CAN LEARN HOW TO TALK ABOUT IT
19:53:14  MORE OPENLY.
THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:53:18 AND THE FINAL ORAL COMMUNICATIONS SPEAKER IS WILLIAM
19:53:21  YRAGUI.
WELCOME, WILLIAM
19:53:24 .
>> THANK YOU.
MISSION PEAK CONSERVANCY.

19:53:28 THANK YOU.

19:53:32 MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL, STAFF, GOOD EVENING.
THE BOARD MEETING TODAY AT
19:53:35  EAST BAY, THEY DID REACH AGREEMENT TO ACCEPT THE 25-
19:53:38 YEAR LEASE NEGOTIATED WITH THE CITY STAFF FOR 900 ACRES
19:53:41  AT MISSION PEAK.
WE APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT WAS
19:53:45  REQUIRED TO NEGOTIATE THIS DOM AND RECOMMEND THAT THE CITY COUNCIL APPROVE
19:53:48  THE LEASE
19:53:51 MENT THAT COMES BEFORE THIS BODY.
DURING MEETING
19:53:54  THEY COMMENTED ON THE NEED TO PROTECT THEIR DEVELOPMENT FROM LANDSLIDES THAT MIGHT
19:53:57  IMPACT THEIR HOMES.
SEVERAL YEARS AGO DURING A CONVERSATION WITH
19:54:01  OUR FORMER CITY ATTORNEY, HARVEY LEVINE,
19:54:04  HE STATED THOSE LIVING BELOW THE MASSIVE ROCK SLIDES
19:54:07  THAT THREATEN THOSE BELOW IT ARE NOTIFIED EACH YEAR THAT
19:54:10  THE CITY IS NOT LIABLE FOR DAMAGE
19:54:14  CAUSED BY ACTS OF GOD.
HOWEVER,
19:54:17  HOMES CONTINUE TO BE BUILT BELOW MISSION PEAK EVEN THOUGH THERE IS A LONG
19:54:21  HISTORY OF EARTH MOVEMENT.
HOMEOWNERS JUSTIFY THE DEVELOP
19:54:25  DEVELOPMENT AND DO NOT RISE UP IN PROTEST BUT THEN FIND IT DIFFICULT
19:54:28  TO UNDERSTAND WHY OUR REGIONAL PARKS SHOULD HAVE
19:54:31  ENOUGH ESTABLISHED PARK FOR THOSE VISITING.

19:54:34 THIS WILL BE -- FOR
19:54:37  GATES BLOCKING THE PARK ENTRANCE AND CONSTRUCTION OF HYPHENS.

19:54:41  HIGH FENCES.
EXTENDING THE
19:54:44  LEASE FOR ANOTHER 25 YEARS WILL ENCOURAGE THE CITY AND PARK DISTRICT TO CONSIDER
19:54:47  THE NEEDS OF ALL MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY.
IT'S TIME FOR CITY LEADERS
19:54:50  TO PRIORITIZE THE NEEDS OF THOSE VISITING OUR CITY TO ENSURE
19:54:53  THAT THEY ARE WELCOMED AND ARE LEFT WITH FUNDS TO
19:54:57  PATRONIZE OUR BUSINESSES.
THANK YOU.

19:55:03 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
THAT IS THE LAST OF OUR PUBLIC COMMENTS.

19:55:08 NEXT I WILL TURN IT BACK TO OUR AGENDA ITEMS, WHICH ARE THE
19:55:11  CONSENT ITEMS THAT WERE PULLED OFF OF
19:55:14  THE CONSENT CALENDAR THIS EVENING.
I BELIEVE
19:55:22  BELIEVE THEY ARE ITEMS 2C AND 2D.
WE'LL BEGIN
19:55:25  FIRST WITH ITEM 2C, AND I THINK WE HAD A COUPLE SPEAKER
19:55:28 S.
>> Ms. Gauthier: MARIE
19:55:31  H. AND LANCE K
19:55:34 WAN WERE THE ONES THAT WANTED THE ITEM PULLED.

19:55:38 I DON'T SEE
19:55:43  MARIE H. ON HERE ANY LONGER BUT LANCE
19:55:46  KWAN IS HERE.
WE CAN ALLOW LANCE TO
19:55:50  SPEAK.
>> I'M HERE.

19:55:53 >> Ms. Gauthier: LANCE?
>> YES, I'M HERE.
SORRY.

19:55:56 >> Ms. Gauthier: GO AHEAD.
>> HI, CITY COUNCILMEMBERS OF FREMONT.

19:56:00 MY NAME IS LANCE W
19:56:03  KWAN,
19:56:06  FORMER HUMAN RELATIONS COMMISSIONER AS WELL AS THE OWE
19:56:09  OHLONE TRUSTEE.
I FIND IT RARE THAT I
19:56:13  EVER CREATE
19:56:16  AGREE WITH COUNCILMEMBER
19:56:19  SHAO AND KASSAN BUT I DO AGREE WITH THEM IN THIS CASE ABOUT THE
19:56:23  AFFORDABLE HOUSING ORDINANCE.
THEY HAD BROUGHT IT IN THE LAST TIME THIS
19:56:26  HAD BEEN BROUGHT UP IN MID OCTOBER THAT THE TOWNHOME
19:56:29  PORTION OF THE IN LIEU FEE SHOULD BE RAISED TO
19:56:33  $50.
I WOULD ENCOURAGE THAT THE CITY COUNCIL DO
19:56:37  -- THAT OUR CITY COUNCIL TAKES
19:56:40  ACTION IN
19:56:44  TERMS OF INCREASING THOSE FEES BASED OFF OF WHAT THE PLANNING COMMISSION RECOMMEND
19:56:47 ED VERSUS WHAT THE STAFF HAD RECOMMENDED, THE REASON BEING BECAUSE RIGHT NOW
19:56:52 , THE WAY THE CITY OF FREMONT IS
19:56:55  GOING IN ORDER TO MEET THE
19:56:59  RHNA NUMBERS WE NEED, WE NEED TO
19:57:02  MOVE AWAY FROM TOWNHOMES TO BE
19:57:06  HONEST.
THE FACT THAT WE SELL AN AVERAGE HOME IN THE
19:57:10  CITY OF FREMONT FOR
19:57:13  $1.4 MILLION YET WE WANT TO TARGET SO MANY
19:57:17  -- POPULATIONS THAT
19:57:21  -- NOT EVEN THINKING WHAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED A LOANABLE AMOUNT FOR THAT
19:57:24  PRICEPOINT IS KIND OF RIDICULOUS, AND I
19:57:27  DID REALLY -- I DO REALLY URGE CITY COUNCIL
19:57:31  TO KIND OF TAKE INTO THE PLAN
19:57:34  COMMISSION'S SUGGESTION JUST SO THAT WE'RE ENCOURAGING
19:57:38  ACTUAL AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT AND ENCOURAGING
19:57:42  ACTUAL REPLANNING AND REZONING OR RE-THINKING
19:57:45  OF PROJECTS SO THAT WAY WE'RE FOCUSED ON MAKING
19:57:51  MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING, MORE SUSTAINABLE HOUSING AND HOUSING FOR
19:57:54  THE FUTURE, BECAUSE QUITE HONESTLY AND QUITE FRANKLY
19:57:58 , IT'S KIND OF RIDICULOUS THAT I HAVE BEEN A RESIDENT OF
19:58:01  FREMONT FOR ALL 30 YEARS OF MY LIFE AND RIGHT NOW, I HAVE TO
19:58:05  LOOK AT THE FACT THAT I MIGHT
19:58:08  NOT EVER BE ABLE TO AFFORD A HOME HERE IN
19:58:11  FREMONT BASED OFF THE WAY THAT THE TRENDS ARE GOING RIGHT NOW.
THANK YOU SO
19:58:14  MUCH FOR YOUR TIME.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
NEXT SPEAKER IS MARIE.

19:58:20 I BELIEVE SHE IS ON THE LINE.

19:58:26 >> Ms. Gauthier: WE'VE UNMUTED HER.
>> MY NAME IS MARIE HUGHES.
I'M ON
19:58:29  THE LEADERSHIP TEAM OF FREMONT FOR EVERYONE, AND WE WOULD LIKE TO MAKE
19:58:32  THIS STATEMENT.

19:58:36 WE ALLOW COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN'S SUPPORT FOR INCREASING REVENUE
19:58:39  FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND WE'D LIKE TO BROADEN THE CONVERSATION TO LOOK FOR
19:58:42  MORE SOURCES OF FUNDING, AND WE
19:58:45  TAKE NO POSITION ON THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF FUNDING FOR TOWNHOUSES
19:58:48 .

19:58:54 THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:58:59 JUST CHECKING TO SEE
19:59:04 .
OKAY.
WE'LL BRING IT BACK TO THE COUNCIL.

19:59:07 >> Ms. Gauthier: MAYOR,  MR. BEEKMAN HAS
19:59:10  NOW RAISED HIS HAND FOR THIS ITEM.

19:59:14 >> Mayor Mei: BLAIR YOU ARE YOU SPEAKING ON THIS ITEM NOW?
>> 
19:59:17 I JUST HAD A QUICK PROCEDURAL QUESTION.
YOU GOT MY
19:59:21  NOTE THAT I WANTED TO SPEAK ON ITEM 2D TODAY?

19:59:25 >> Ms. Gauthier: YEAH, WE'RE NOT ON THAT ITEM.
>> Mayor Mei: WE'RE NOT ON THAT
19:59:28  ITEM YET.
SO THAT WILL BE AFTER THIS ITEM
19:59:31 .
THEY'RE SEPARATELY HEARD.

19:59:36 SO MAY I GET ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTION
19:59:40  -- OR MOTIONS FROM THE COUNCIL ON ITEM
19:59:43  2C AS IN CAT, WHICH IS THE SECOND
19:59:46  READING AND ADOPTION OF THE ORDINANCE OF THE CITY
19:59:49  OF FREMONT AMENDING FREMONT MUNICIPAL CODE
19:59:53  TITLE 1B.

19:59:58 I SEE DEBRA MARGOLIS.
DID
20:00:01  YOU -- WERE YOU TRYING TO SPEAK SM I'M SORRY.
>> Ms. Margolis: I
20:00:04  WAS GOING TO SAY IT TITLE 18, NOT 1C
20:00:06 .
>> Mayor Mei: 18.
SORRY.

20:00:10 THAT'S MY VISION.

20:00:13 SO THANK YOU FOR THE CLARIFICATION.

20:00:16 DO I GET
20:00:19  A MOTION TO MOVE FORWARD?
>> Ms. Gauthier: YOU HAVE COUNCILMEMBERS
20:00:23  KASSAN, JONES AND SALWAN RAISING THEIR HANDS.

20:00:26 >> Mayor Mei: I COULDN'T SEE THAT.
SORRY.
BECAUSE IT DOESN'T SHOW ON
20:00:29  -- OKAY.
SO WE'LL START WITH COUNCILMEMBER
20:00:32  KASSAN.
>> Councilmember Kassan: THANK YOU.

20:00:36 YES, I'M REALLY GRATEFUL FOR MR. K
20:00:39 WAN PULLING THIS ITEM.

20:00:43 I REALLY DO WONDER WHY WE
20:00:46  SPEND SO MUCH MONEY ON FEASIBILITY STUDIES AND
20:00:49  THEN CHOOSE NOT TO FOLLOW THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS.
I THINK CONSULTANT
20:00:52 S GENERALLY DO TRY TO ERR ON THE MORE CONSERVATIVE SIDE
20:00:55  TO PREVENT ANY PROBLEMS DOWN THE ROAD, AND THEY DID
20:00:59  RECOMMEND A HIGHER FEE FOR TOWNHOMES
20:01:02 .
I THINK WE HAVE AN OVERDEVELOPMENT OF TOWNHOMES
20:01:05  IN OUR CITY, AND IT'S NOT -- I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT
20:01:09  ADDING AN ADDITIONAL
20:01:12  $6 PER SQUARE FOOT FEE ON TOWNHOMES.
PEOPLE SEEM TO REALLY LOVE BILLING
20:01:16  THOSE IN FREMONT.
AND EVERY TIME WE ADD TO THE
20:01:19  IN LIEU FEES, IT ADDS TO THE FUNDS WE HAVE AVAILABLE
20:01:22  TO BUILD MORE AFFORDABLE UNITS.
THESE ARE
20:01:25  THE FEES THAT HAVE LED TO THE BUILDING OF HUNDREDS AND
20:01:28  HUNDREDS OF AFFORDABLE UNITS, INCLUDING FOR
20:01:31  VERY LOW INCOME PEOPLE IN OUR CITY.
SO I
20:01:34  JUST WISH THAT GIVEN THAT WE DID GET THAT RECOMMENDATION FROM
20:01:38  OUR CONSULTANT, AND IT WAS ALSO THE RECOMMENDATION OF THE PLANNING
20:01:41  COMMISSION, THAT WE WOULD GO AHEAD AND ADOPT THAT LEVEL OF
20:01:44  FEE FOR TOWNHOMES AND ALSO I WOULD ASK
20:01:47  THAT WE GO BACK TO THE ORIGINAL PROPOSAL FROM STAFF
20:01:50  THAT WE IMPLEMENT THAT OVER A TWO-YEAR PERIOD, NOT A
20:01:53  THREE-YEAR PERIOD.
THANK YOU.

20:01:57 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
NEXT IS COUNCILMEMBER JONES.
>> Councilmember Jones: THANK
20:02:00  YOU, MADAME MAYOR.
I WAS ACTUALLY READY TO MAKE A MOTION,
20:02:03  BUT JUST TO CLARIFY A COUPLE THINGS AS FAR AS I'M CONCERN
20:02:06 ED, THE
20:02:10  $44 A SQUARE FOOT FEE IS GOING TO BE THE HIGHEST IN THE REGION.

20:02:14 AND I MEAN, WE'RE HIGHER THAN SANTA CLARA, SAN JOSÉ
20:02:18 , ANYBODY ELSE, AND THE GENERAL BELIEF, I THINK,
20:02:21  IS THAT IF WE RAISE IT HIGHER THAN THAT, IF WE RAISE TO $50 A
20:02:24  SQUARE FOOT, IT'S GOING TO
20:02:27  PREVENT THOSE DEVELOPERS FROM EVEN PRESENTING PROJECTS IN FREMONT.
AND
20:02:31  AS COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN MENTIONED, THOSE TYPES OF PROJECT
20:02:34 S ARE THE ONES THAT BRING US OUR IN LIEU FEE
20:02:37 S THAT PROVIDE THE FUNDING
20:02:41  FOR -- WE HAVE FUNDING AVAILABLE FOR
20:02:44  THREE PROJECTS ON ITEM 7B THAT WAS PULLED A LITTLE
20:02:47  BIT EARLIER.
YOU KNOW, THE UNFORTUNATE
20:02:50  TRUTH IS IF YOU LOOKED AT THAT
20:02:53  ITEM, THE CHEAPEST UNIT TO BUILD IS
20:02:57  $652,000.
IT'S REALLY
20:03:01  UNFORTUNATE THAT IN SILICON VALLEY, THERE'S REALLY NO SUCH THING AS
20:03:04  AFFORDABLE HOUSING.
BUT WITHOUT
20:03:07  THOSE IN LIEU FEES, WE DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY
20:03:10  TO FUND THOSE PROJECTS AND IF WE DRIVE THE FEE
20:03:13 S UP, WE'RE GOING TO
20:03:17  DISCOURAGE DEVELOPERS FROM COMING IN AND BUILDING.
AND I KNOW
20:03:20  THAT WE'RE GETTING AWAY FROM SINGLE-FAMILY HOMES
20:03:23 , BUT TOWNHOMES ARE KIND OF A COMPROMISE,
20:03:26  I BELIEVE, AND YOU'RE GETTING A LOT MORE
20:03:30  INTO A MUCH SMALLER SPACE.
THOSE SEEM TO BE VERY,
20:03:33  VERY POPULAR WITH PEOPLE.
THEY WANT A GARAGE, THEY WANT A BACKYARD FOR
20:03:36  THEIR KIDS TO PLAY.
YOU DON'T HAVE THOSE
20:03:39  VAIBILITIES
20:03:42  IN AN APARTMENT OR CONDO COMPLEX BUT
20:03:46  I DO KNOW WE'RE GETTING AWAY FROM THE SINGLE-FAMILY HOMES.
BUT I THINK RAISING
20:03:49  THE FEES IS GOING TO DISCOURAGE ANYBODY FROM COMING IN AND BUILDING AGAIN,
20:03:52  AND WE'RE GOING TO LOSE OUR AFFORDABLE HOUSING FUNDING.
SO
20:03:54  I'M VERY MUCH IN FAVOR OF THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION.
THANK YOU.

20:03:58 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
NEXT IS COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN.

20:04:00 >> Councilmember Salwan: THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR.
IS STAFF HERE?

20:04:05 DAN OR THE
20:04:08  CONSULTANT, ARE THEY AVAILABLE?
>> City Mgr. Shackelford: WE DO HAVE DAN ON
20:04:11  THE CALL.
I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THE CONSULTANT, BUT IF YOU HAVE A
20:04:15  QUESTION, PLEASE PROCEED.

20:04:18 HOPEFULLY WE'LL HAVE AN ANSWER.
>> Councilmember Salwan: WELL, DAN IS THE MAN, SO
20:04:21  HE ALWAYS KNOWS ALL THE ANSWERS SO
20:04:25  -- FIRST QUESTION, THERE WAS A MENTION THAT THE
20:04:28  CONSULTANT HAD RECOMMENDED THE $50 FEE.

20:04:32 I JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY WHAT THE PURPOSE
20:04:35  OF THE STUDY IS AND WHAT THAT MAX
20:04:39  LEVEL MEANS.

20:04:42 >> SO THE CONSULTANT STUDIED WHAT
20:04:45  FEE COULD FEASIBLY BE
20:04:48  ACCOMMODATED BY NEW DEVELOPMENT
20:04:52  WITHOUT MAKING THE DEVELOPMENT IN
20:04:55 FEASIBLE.
AND SO WHAT THEY FOUND IS
20:04:58  THAT FOR TOWNHOME PROJECTS
20:05:01 , A $50 FEE IS FEASIBLE
20:05:05  WITHOUT DISCOURAGING DEVELOPMENT
20:05:08 , AND FOR SINGLE-FAMILY HOMES, THEY
20:05:11  FOUND THAT A $44 FEE WAS FEASIBLE
20:05:15  WITHOUT DISCOURAGING  DEVELOPMENT.

20:05:19 >> Councilmember Salwan: I THINK THESE STUDIES ARE OFTEN
20:05:22  USED TO DEFEND AGAINST LAWSUITS THAT A CITY MAY BE CHARGING
20:05:25  TOO MANY FEES.
CORRECT?

20:05:31 >> YEAH, IN THIS CASE, BECAUSE OF THE CHANGES
20:05:34  IN STATE LAW WHERE IT BECAME CLEAR THAT WE HAVE
20:05:38  THE ABILITY TO REQUIRE INCLUSIONARY HOUSING
20:05:41 , I MEAN, I WOULD DEFER TO DEBRA ON THIS, BUT I THINK
20:05:44  IT'S LESS LIKELY THAT THE CITY
20:05:48  WOULD BE SUED REGARDING THE LEVELS OF OUR FEES
20:05:51  BECAUSE IT'S REALLY AN ALTERNATIVE THAT WE'RE GIVING DEVELOPER
20:05:54 S TO DOING THE INCLUSIONARY
20:05:58  UNITS.
SO IT'S REALLY MORE I THINK WE DON'T WANT TO
20:06:02  -- IF WE DISCOURAGE DEVELOPMENT, WE DON'T COLLECT ANY
20:06:05  FEES.

20:06:08 SO I THINK THE IDEA IS WE WANT TO FIND A SWEET SPOT, AND
20:06:11  I THINK THAT THAT'S THE INTENT
20:06:15  OF THIS STUDY, AND I WOULD CAUTION, THOUGH
20:06:18 , THAT THE STUDY IS BASED ON MODELING,
20:06:22  AND CONDITIONS CHANGE AND SO IT'S
20:06:25  DIFFICULT TO SAY WITH CERTAINTY, YOU KNOW
20:06:28 , EXACTLY WHAT THE LEVEL IS WHERE
20:06:32  IT BECOMES INFEASIBLE.
IT'S JUST A
20:06:35  REALITY THAT THESE ARE -- YOU KNOW, THEY'RE MODELS
20:06:38  AND THEY'RE STUDIES, BUT THIS IS THE BEST INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE.

20:06:43 >> Councilmember Salwan: I BELIEVE STAFF HAD RECOMMENDED A
20:06:46  $44 FEE.
IS THAT CORRECT?
>>
20:06:49  CORRECT.
STAFF RECOMMENDED THE
20:06:53  $44 FEE BE APPLIED TO BOTH TOWNHOMES
20:06:57  AND TO SINGLE-FAMILY HOMES.
AND
20:07:00  THAT WAS PARTLY BASED ON THE
20:07:03  FACT THAT FREMONT'S FEES ARE
20:07:07  THE HIGHEST IN THE AREA
20:07:10  AND WE THOUGHT THAT THAT WAY, WE WOULDN'T BE SO
20:07:14  FAR ABOVE OTHER CITIES.
AND IT WAS
20:07:17  ALSO BASED ON JUST SORT OF THE EASE OF ADMINISTRATION
20:07:20  BECAUSE, YOU  KNOW, HAVING
20:07:24  ONE FEE IS MORE STRAIGHTFORWARD AND IS CLEARER
20:07:27 .
SO THAT WAS THE
20:07:31  MOTIVATION BEHIND THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION.

20:07:34 >> AND THEN YOU HAD MENTIONED SOME OF OUR NEIGHBOR
20:07:37 ING CITIES.
DO YOU HAVE THOSE STATISTICS, WHAT
20:07:41  FREMONT, NEWARK, UNION  CITY, MILL PEE
20:07:44  MILIPITAS, WHAT THEY CHARGE?

20:07:47 DO YOU HAVE THOSE?
>> I DON'T KNOW THAT WE HAVE THAT SLIDE AVAILABLE.

20:07:50 WE SHOWED IT ON THE 12TH, I BELIEVE.
WE'VE
20:07:53  LOOKED AT COMPARISON  CITIES, AND I
20:07:57  THINK THEY RANGED, YOU
20:08:00  KNOW, $43 IN SAN JOSÉ
20:08:03  FOR CERTAIN AREAS
20:08:06  WAS THE HIGHEST OF ANY OF OUR SURROUNDING CITIES, AND THEN THEY RANGED, I
20:08:09  WOULD SAY, FROM SOMEWHERE IN THE TEENS ALL THE WAY UP INTO THE
20:08:12  30s IN TERMS OF
20:08:17  THE DOLLAR PER SQUARE FOOT.
>> Councilmember Salwan: 
20:08:20 SO I HAD THE SLIDE THAT I HAPPENED
20:08:23  TO GET FROM YOU EARLIER, AND SO I HAD SEEN FEE
20:08:26 S OF
20:08:29  29 AT  LIVERMORE, 25 WITH
20:08:32  SAN JOSÉ FOR THE FOR SALE.

20:08:36 I THINK FOR THE RENTAL IS WHERE IT WAS 43,
20:08:39  AND THAT, AGAIN, WAS IN THE STRONGER AREAS.
HAYWARD,
20:08:42  I THINK WAS ONLY
20:08:46  15 OR 19, SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

20:08:49 SO I THINK ACCORDING TO -- AND I MEAN, THEY WERE
20:08:52  ALL VERY, VERY LOW, AND I THINK YOU HAD MENTIONED THAT WE WERE
20:08:55  ALREADY ONE OF THE HIGHEST.
AND SO
20:09:00  BY $44, WE'RE STILL THE HIGHEST.
WE'RE
20:09:03  THE HIGHEST IN THE AREA.
SO I DON'T THINK THAT WE'RE CHARGING LOW FEES
20:09:06 , WE'RE STILL CHARGING THE HIGHEST FEES.
AND WE'VE BEEN
20:09:09  CHARGING COMMERCIAL FEES PRIOR TO SAN JOSÉ,
20:09:13  THAT BOOMERANG FUNDS
20:09:16 , AS A RESULT, WE BUILT SO MANY AFFORDABLE
20:09:19  HOUSING UNITS, SO I THINK WE ARE LEADING, WE HAVE THE HIGHEST FEES
20:09:22 .
I DON'T THINK WE HAVE TO GO TO THE LEGALLY DEFENSIBLE
20:09:26  $50, WHICH IS THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE, AND WE SHOULD LISTEN TO
20:09:29  OUR CONSULTANTS AND OUR STAFF, AND OUR
20:09:32  STAFF IS RECOMMENDING FROG FOUR THE
20:09:39  -- WE DON'T HAVE TO GET
20:09:42  FLAGGED BY THE NEWS MEDIA THAT CITY OF FREMONT CHARGES TOO MANY FEES
20:09:45  OR TOO HIGH FEES.
THAT RAISES A GOOD POINT.

20:09:48 TOWNHOMES ARE VERY OFTEN AN ENTRY LEVEL HOUSING
20:09:51  PRODUCT.
SO FOLKS SUCH AS LANCE AND MANY OTHERS,
20:09:55  THEY FIRST MOVE TO A TOWNHOME OR A CONDO AND THEN THEY
20:09:59  WORK THEIR WAY UP FROM THERE.

20:10:03 SO IF WE INCREASE THE FEES TOO MUCH, THAT WILL DISCOURAGE DEVELOP
20:10:06 MENT.
AND WHEN YOU DISCOURAGE
20:10:10   DEVELOPMENT, YOU GET NO  DEVELOPMENT,
20:10:13  IF YOU DON'T GET THE DEVELOPMENT, YOU DON'T GET
20:10:16  THE 44%.
SO I THINK WE ARE DOING A GOOD COMPROMISE
20:10:19  HERE, WE ARE LISTENING TO OUR STAFF, DOING THE $44
20:10:23  $44, WE'LL STILL BE THE  HIGHEST AND WE'LL COLLECT LOTS OF
20:10:26  AFFORDABLE HOUSING FEES.
SO WITH THAT, I'M HAPPY TO
20:10:29  SECOND COUNCILMEMBER JONES' MOTION.
>> OKAY, THANK YOU
20:10:32 .
ALSO WE HAVE COUNCILMEMBER KENG.
>> Councilmember Keng: THANK YOU, 
20:10:35 MADAME MAYOR.
SO I DO WANT TO -- I DO AGREE
20:10:38  WITH COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN AND
20:10:44  COMMENTS AT THE LAST MEETING THAT WE SHOULD BE CHARGING
20:10:48  THE CONDOS, TOWNHOMES, AT THE
20:10:52  $50 SO WE CAN GET MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING FUNDS.
THANK YOU.

20:10:58 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
COUNCILMEMBER SHAO.
VICE MAYOR SHAO
20:10:59 .
>> Vice Mayor Shao: THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR.

20:11:02 I JUST WANT TO REMIND
20:11:06  THE CITY COUNCILMEMBERS THAT TWO YEARS AGO, WHEN
20:11:09  WE WERE AT THE  RETREAT, WE FOUND OUT THAT ALL THE
20:11:12  DEVELOPERS,
20:11:15  WITHOUT ANY EXCEPTION
20:11:19 , AND AT THAT TIME, THE
20:11:22  CITY COUNCIL
20:11:29  INCREASED FEES TO WHERE IT'S TO LONGER
20:11:32  A -- IT'S A NO-BRAINER FOR ANY DEVELOPER JUST
20:11:36  TO PAY IN LIEU FEES,  RATHER, WE WOULD ENCOURAGE
20:11:39  YOU TO BUILD
20:11:42  INCLUSIONARY UNITS.
SO I DO NOT WANT TO BELABOR THE ISSUE,
20:11:45  BUT I STILL SUPPORT
20:11:48  MY ORIGINAL
20:11:51  THOUGHT THAT WE SHOULD KEEP THE DEVELOP
20:11:54 ER FEES AT $50.

20:11:59 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN.

20:12:02 >> Councilmember Kassan: THANKS.
A COUPLE THINGS.
NUMBER ONE, I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE 
20:12:06 IT'S CLEAR THAT THERE'S TWO DIFFERENT THINGS, THERE'S A NEXUS STUDY
20:12:09  AND A FEASIBILITY STUDY.
THE NEXUS STUDY SHOW
20:12:12 S HOW MUCH WE WOULD NEED TO CHARGE
20:12:15  IN IN LIEU FEES TO COVER THE
20:12:19  COSTS OF BUILDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING, CAUSED
20:12:22  BY THE DEMAND THAT'S GENERATED BY BUILDING MARKET RATE HOUSING.

20:12:25 THE FEASIBILITY STUDY THEN LOOKS
20:12:29  AT THOSE NUMBERS AND DOES A FINANCIAL FEASIBLE
20:12:32  ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE WHETHER THOSE FEES WOULD BE FEASIBLE IN THE MARKET OR
20:12:35  WHETHER IT WOULD HURT OUR -- IT WOULD MAKE DEVELOPER
20:12:38 S CHOOSE NOT TO DO PROJECTS IN FREMONT.
THE
20:12:41  FEASIBILITY STUDY RESULTED OVERALL IN LOWER FEES, SO EVEN IF
20:12:44  WE DO CHARGE THE FULL AMOUNTS THAT
20:12:48  WERE SHOWN AS FEASIBLE BY OUR CONSULTANT,
20:12:51  WE STILL WOULD NOT BE COVERING THE
20:12:54  FULL COSTS THAT ARE CREATED BY THE  DEVELOPMENT OF
20:12:57  AFFORDABLE HOUSING, WHICH IS -- I'M  SORRY -- BY THE
20:13:00  DEVELOPMENT OF MARKET RATE
20:13:04  HOUSING WHICH IS WHAT'S SHOWN IN THE NEXUS STUDY.
SO
20:13:07  EVERY TIME A MARKET RATE HOUSE GETS BUILT IN FREMONT, WE ARE CAUSING
20:13:11  MORE DEMAND FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT IS NOT BEING
20:13:14  FILLED, EVEN IF WE DO
20:13:18  TOLD TO US BY OUR CONSULTANT THAT
20:13:21  IT WOULD BE FEASIBLE.
SO I JUST WANT PEOPLE TO KEEP THAT IN
20:13:25  MIND, THAT AS WE CONTINUE TO ENCOURAGE MARKET RATE HOUSING THAT,
20:13:28  I'M SORRY, I
20:13:32  DON'T THINK OUR MIDDLE INCOME CAN AFFORD THAT
20:13:37  $1.2 MILLION TOWNHOME.
EVERY TIME ONE OF THOSE GET BUILT, IT CAUSES
20:13:40  THE NEED FOR MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING.
THAT'S WHY WE DO
20:13:43  OUR IN LIEU  FEES AND OUR
20:13:48  INCLUSIONARY  ZONING.
WE CONTINUE TO HAVE FEWER AND FEWER NEEDS MET
20:13:51  IN TERMS OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING.
THE OTHER THING I WOULD LIKE TO SAY IS I WOULD
20:13:54  LIKE TO SEPARATE OUT THE TWO ISSUES.
THERE'S
20:13:57  ONE ISSUE WHICH IS, IS IT $44 OR
20:14:00  $50.
IF WE GO FOR THE $44, WE'RE GOING WITH WHAT
20:14:03  STAFF  RECOMMENDED.
THE OTHER ISSUE IS THE
20:14:07  PERIOD OF TIME TO PHASE IN THE INCREASE IN FEES.
STAFF
20:14:10  RECOMMENDED TWO YEARS AND
20:14:13  THEN COUNCIL INCREASED TO THREE.
SO I THINK THOSE ARE
20:14:18  TWO SEPARATE ISSUES.
YOU CAN USE THE EXCUSE THAT YOU'RE GOING WITH WHAT STAFF
20:14:21  RECOMMENDED IF YOU ONLY GO WITH THE $44, BUT
20:14:25  YOU CAN --
20:14:27  I'D LIKE TO VOTE ON THOSE WHO ITEMS SEPARATELY.
THANK YOU.

20:14:34 >> Mayor Mei: I ALSO SEE COUNCILMEMBER COX AND I WAS GOING TO ASK THE MAKERS OF THE
20:14:37  MOTION IF THEY WOULD WANT THE FRIENDLY AMENDMENT IF YOU
20:14:41  DON'T, YOU SHOULD
20:14:44  LET US KNOW.
COUNCILMEMBER JONES.
>> Councilmember Jones: IF
20:14:48  WE HAVE A CONSENSUS OF THE COUNCIL TO GO
20:14:51  WITH THE TWO YEARS THAT STAFF RECOMMENDED, I'M OKAY WL
20:14:54  THAT.
>> OKAY.
WE'VE ALREADY
20:14:57  HAD THAT CONTINUED MOTION BY COUNCILMEMBER JONES AND SECONDED
20:15:01  BY COUNCILMEMBER IS A WAN,
20:15:08  COUNCILMEMBER COX.
I'M
20:15:11  SORRY, YOU ARE ON MUTE.
THANK YOU.
>> Councilmember Cox: WE
20:15:14  WERE BASICALLY CHANGING
20:15:17  THE CITY COUNCIL DECISION FROM LAST MONTH AND ROLLING IT
20:15:21  INTO $50 OVER A TWO-YEAR PERIOD.
IS THAT WHAT
20:15:24  I'M UNDERSTANDING NOW?
>> Mayor Mei: NO, NO, THE MOTION AS IT WAS
20:15:27  MADE WAS TO CONTINUE WITH THE PREVIOUS
20:15:31  APPROVAL, WHICH WAS AT $44.

20:15:34 AND WITH THE -- IT'S
20:15:37  JUST A SECOND OF THE PREVIOUS DECISION
20:15:42  OF THE COUNCIL AND AT THREE YEARS.
AND DEBRA, IF
20:15:45  YOU WANTED TO CLARIFY IF THERE'S ANYTHING ELSE WE NEEDED TO DO, BUT
20:15:48  I BELIEVE THAT THEY DID NOT ACCEPT THAT, SO WE HAVE A MOTION AND
20:15:51  SECOND ON THE FLOOR.

20:15:55 >> City Mgr. Shackelford: I WOULD SUGGEST, MADAME MAYOR, THAT IT MAY BE HELPFUL
20:15:58  IF COUNCILMEMBER JONES RESTATED HIS MOTION.

20:16:01 >> Mayor Mei: I WAS GOING TO ASK THAT TOO.
THANK YOU.

20:16:07 >> Councilmember Jones: SO I WOULD MOVE TO ACCEPT THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION FOR $44 A
20:16:10  SQUARE FOOT.
WHAT I HAD MENTIONED IS THAT THERE
20:16:13  SEEMS TO BE A CONSENSUS OF COUNCIL TO GO WITH THE TWO-
20:16:17 YEAR RECOMMENDATION OF STAFF.
I'M OKAY WITH MAKING THAT AMENDMENT TO THE MOTION
20:16:20 .
>> Councilmember Salwan: AND I'M NOT OPPOSED
20:16:24  TO TWO YEARS EITHER SO IF THAT WILL GET MORE VOTES,
20:16:27  IF WE CAN GET 7 OUT OF 7, I'M HAPPY TO DO THE
20:16:30  TWO-YEAR.
>> Councilmember Jones: SO I WILL ACCEPT THAT PART OF COUNCILMEMBER
20:16:33  KASSAN'S FRIENDLY AMENDMENT TO REDUCE IT
20:16:36  FROM THREE YEARS TO TWO YEARS BUT CONTINUE FORWARD AT
20:16:40  $44 A SQUARE FOOT.
>> Mayor Mei: WE HAVE A MOTION AND A
20:16:43  SECOND.
I'D LIKE TO CALL THE VOTE.

20:16:48 >> Ms. Gauthier: COUNCILMEMBER COX, AYE.

20:16:53 COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN, AYE.
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN,
20:16:58  NO AND I WOULD LIKE TO BE NOTED IN THE MINUTES THAT THE REASON IS
20:17:01  BECAUSE WE'RE NOT INCREASING TO $50.
THANK YOU.

20:17:08 >> Ms. Gauthier: COUNCILMEMBER JONES, AYE.
COUNCILMEMBER
20:17:11  KENG, NO, AND SAME
20:17:14  REASON, TO INCREASE TO 50.
THANK YOU.

20:17:20 >> Ms. Gauthier: VICE MAYOR  SH SHAO,
20:17:24  NAY, FOR THE SAME REASON, I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE RATE
20:17:27  AT $50.
>> Ms. Gauthier: ALL RIGHT, SO NOTED.
MAYOR
20:17:30  MEI?
>> Mayor Mei: EYAYE.
SO THE MOTION PASSES
20:17:34  WITH FOUR AYES AND THREE NAYS AS NOTED WITH THE REASONS
20:17:37  FOR THE VOTES
20:17:40  FROM THEM.
THANK YOU.
NEXT ITEM ON THE CONSENT CALENDAR THAT 
20:17:43 WAS PULLED WAS ITEM 2D, WHICH IS THE WINTER RELIEF
20:17:47  SERVICE AGREEMENT AND BLAIR, I BELIEVE, WANTED TO ADDRESS THAT
20:17:50  ITEM.
MR. BEEKMAN.

20:17:54 >> HI.
THANK YOU.
BLAIR BEEKMAN HERE.

20:17:57 I GUESS, YOU KNOW, THIS IS A
20:18:02  WINTER HOUSING ITEM, AND HOUSING OF HOMELESS PEOPLE, I GUESS
20:18:05 , KIND OF ISSUE.
AND I.
US WANTED TO
20:18:08  THANK YOURSELVES FOR THE WORK THAT YOU DO IN FREMONT
20:18:12  TOWARDS THESE IDEAS AND GOALS.

20:18:16 THESE GOOD IDEAS AND PRACTICE, I GUESS, MAYBE IS ANOTHER
20:18:19  WAY TO PUT IT.
YEAH, I'M PRETTY IMPRESSED WITH
20:18:23  HOW MAYOR MEI CAN TALK ABOUT THIS ISSUE.
SO
20:18:27  THANK YOU.

20:18:31 I THINK STARTING FROM THIS PAST JULY, STARTING IN BERKELEY
20:18:34 , THEY START
20:18:38 ED TALKING ABOUT THE FUTURE OF SUBSIDY FUNDING FROM THE STATE
20:18:41  AND FEDERAL LEVEL.
THAT IS BECOMING MORE AVAILABLE
20:18:44  FOR THE
20:18:47  USE WITHIN AFFORDABLE HOUSING
20:18:51 , YOU KNOW, FOR HOMELESS HOUSING ISSUES BASICALLY.

20:18:55 AND HOW -- IT WAS IDEAS OF HOW
20:18:58  PEOPLE WHO -- HOMELESS PEOPLE WHO ARE CURRENTLY
20:19:01  IN TRANSITIONAL HOUSING, AND
20:19:04  WITHIN A SYSTEM THAT'S BEEN THE SAME FOR ABOUT THE
20:19:08  PAST FIVE,
20:19:11  10, 20 YEARS NOW, 25, 30 YEARS EVEN,
20:19:15  THAT ONCE THEY'RE IN TRANSITIONAL HOUSING, IT'S
20:19:18  FAIRLY HARD FOR THEM TO OFTEN FIND PERM NABT
20:19:21  NANT HOUSING BECAUSE TO MAKE THAT CHANGE REQUIRES INCOME
20:19:24  AND MONEY AND
20:19:28  THEY OFTEN DON'T HAVE THAT.
THESE NEW SUBSIDY PROGRAMS COMING IN FROM THE
20:19:31  STATE AND FEDERAL LEVEL ARE LEARNING TO ALLOW FOR THAT.

20:19:35 AND CAN HELP
20:19:39  SUBSIDIZE PEOPLE TO AFFORD THAT NOW.
SAN JOSÉ AND I
20:19:42  THINK PENINSULA CITIES ARE USING THE PROGRAM IN TERMS
20:19:46  OF HOME KEY, I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE WAY
20:19:49 S IT CAN BE USED.

20:19:52 THAT CAN BE A WAY TO HOUSE MORE PEOPLE AT ONCE.
THEY END
20:19:56  UP BUYING WHOLE ENTIRE HOTEL BUILDINGS,
20:19:59  PLACE PEOPLE IN THOSE BUILDINGS AND KIND OF SUBSIDIZE IT FROM
20:20:02  THERE AND YOU CAN GET A BUNCH OF PEOPLE HOUSED REALLY QUICKLY
20:20:05 .
THERE ARE
20:20:09  GOOD TRADITIONAL METHODS ALSO THAT I'M HOPEFUL
20:20:12  ABOUT THAT THIS MONEY CAN BE USED TO REALLY
20:20:15  FIND HOUSING FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE IN A TRANSITIONAL
20:20:18  SPACE AND YOU DON'T HAVE THE
20:20:21  NEED TO MAKE TO PERMANENT HOUSING.
THIS IS A TIME
20:20:25  WHERE WE CAN START TO LOOK FOR THAT AND WORK TOWARDS THAT WITH TRADITIONAL
20:20:28  PROGRAMS AS WELL.
SO I JUST WANTED TO REMIND OURSELVES OF THESE THINGS
20:20:31  AND TO NOT BE FEARFUL OF ALL THE NEW SUBSIDY PLANS THAT ARE
20:20:34  COMING THROUGH AT THIS TIME.
AND TO BE RESPONSIBLE ABOUT
20:20:37  IT.
AND TO REALLY RESPECT WHERE THE SUBSIDY IS COMING
20:20:41  FROM AND ASK GOOD QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW THIS MONEY
20:20:44  CAN BE HANDLED REPONS BLI AND
20:20:47  INVESTED RESPONSIBLY SO WE HAVE A GOOD
20:20:50  FUTURE PLAN WITH THESE SORT OF THINGS.
THANKS A LOT FOR THIS
20:20:53  ITEM, AND THANKS FOR YOUR PATIENCE AND TIME
20:20:56  IN HEARING MY PUBLIC COMMENT.
THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU FOR
20:20:59  THE COMMENTS.
I JUST WANTED TO NOTE THAT WE ARE ALWAYS LOOKING
20:21:03  FOR DIFFERENT WAYS TO HELP ADDRESS THE HOMELESS
20:21:06 NESS DISCUSSION AND WE
20:21:09  ARE LOOKING AT A PROJECT POSSIBLY TO SUBMIT
20:21:14  FOR BID, SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS WE ARE TRYING TO LOOK AT, AND WE HAVE
20:21:17  A HOTEL THAT MAY BE IN  MIND.
AT THIS TIME
20:21:20 , CAN I GET A MOTION OR IF THERE
20:21:23  ARE ANY OTHER COMMENT FROM THE COUNCIL?

20:21:27 >> Councilmember Jones: MOVE TO APPROVE.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

20:21:30 MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER JONES, SECONDED BY

HAND.

20:37:17 I TRIED TO BE PATIENT AND THANK 
YOU FOR NOTICING
20:37:20 .
THIS IS ANOTHER YEAR AND WE'RE 
TALKING ABOUT COPS GRANT FUNDING
20:37:24  
AGAIN FOR THIS UPCOMING NEW YEAR 
NOW.
20:37:29 
WE'RE LIVING THE AREA OF GEORGE 
FLOYD A BIT,
20:37:32  THAT'S NOT RIGHT 
WAY TO SAY IT.
BUT THINGS WERE
20:37:35  PRETTY NERVOUS A 
COUPLE OF YEARS AGO.
WE'RE
20:37:39  TALKING ABOUT THESE ISSUES 
IN TERMS OF -- I'VE LEARNED
20:37:42  SOME 
IMPORTANT LESSONS, I'VE
20:37:45  WATCHED 
SOME STUDY SESSIONS IN THE 
OAKLAND AREA AND THE SAME
20:37:49  WITH 
SAN JOSE.
YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN
20:37:52  NOTICING 
THAT CITY GOVERNMENTS AROUND THE 
BAY AREA HAVE BEEN SEEFG LOT
20:37:55  OF 
POLICE FUNDING FOR THEIR
20:37:58  
INFRASTRUCTURE AND BUILDUP OVER 
DID PAST FEW YEARS
20:38:01 .
AND I FEEL THAT HAS CREATED A
20:38:04  
WAY THAT WE CAN -- YOU KNOW,
20:38:07  
THEY HAVE BECOME SO PREPARED 
THAT I THINK IT'S
20:38:10  ALLOWED 
OURSELVES TO BEGIN TO ASK THE 
QUESTIONS OF HOW CAN
20:38:14  WE NOW 
BEGIN TO BETTER ADDRESS THE 
IDEAS OF
20:38:17  REIMAGINE AND EQUITY 
AND HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES 
IDEAS
20:38:20  FOR COMMUNITY.
20:38:23 
AND IT'S INTERESTING.
AND
20:38:26  IT'S HOPEFUL.
AND SAN JOSE AND OAKLAND HAVE 
TAKEN THE STEPS TO
20:38:30  LEARN HOW TO 
BEGIN TO DO THIS MORE.
BECAUSE IT'S A MORE
20:38:33  -- 
CONSIDERING WE POSSIBLY HAVE 
SOME
20:38:36  NATURAL DISASTER AND JUST 
OVERALL EMERGENCY
20:38:39  PREPAREDNESS 
ISSUES FOR THE BAY AREA WE HAVE 
TO BE CONSIDERING FOR THE NEXT
20:38:42  
FEW YEARS, IT MAKES A LOT OF 
SENSE TO NOW BEGIN TO
20:38:46  PRACTICE 
COMMUNITY HEALTH AND HUMAN 
SERVICES IDEAS.
20:38:50 
SO GOOD LUCK WITH THIS ITEM AND 
KNOW THAT WE ARE STILL BUILDING
20:38:53  
OUR FUTURE OF, YOU KNOW,

AND, YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT JUST 
EARTHQUAKE, IT'S
20:41:09  WILDFIRE AND 
SEA LEVEL RISE THAT ARE
20:41:13  
IMPORTANT NATURAL DISASTER 
CONSIDERATIONS FOR

>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU
20:44:08 .
>> David Persselin:   TO PROVIDE 
THE CITY COUNCIL WITH MORE 

20:44:12 TIMELY INFORMATION ABOUT THE 
YEAR JUST COMPLETED WE'VE 
PREPARED THE
20:44:15  FOLLOWING 
INFORMATION USING UNAUDITED 
AMOUNTS.
20:44:18 
WE'LL REPORT ON ANY MATERIAL THE
20:44:21  
AUDIT ADJUSTMENTS AT THE TIME 
THE ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT IS 

20:44:25 PROVIDED TO THE CITY COUNCIL.
NEXT SLIDE, PLEASE.

20:44:31 WE UPDATE OUR REVENUE 
PROJECTIONS THROUGHOUT THE
20:44:34  YEAR 
AS WE RECEIVE NEW INFORMATION.
FOR EXAMPLE, WE USE
20:44:37  THE FISCAL 
YEAR
20:44:41  2020-2021 MIDDIER REPORT IN
20:44:44  
MARCH TO INCREASE OUR SALES
20:44:48  TAX 
PROJECTION TO REFLECT HIGHER 
THAN
20:44:53  ANTICIPATED AUTO SALES.
WE REFLECT IN MAY
20:44:56  AS PART OF THE 
GENERAL FUND FORECAST INCLUDED
20:45:00  
IN THE FISCAL YEAR 2021-22 
PROPOSED BUDGET PRESENTATION
20:45:03 .
AS CAN YOU SEE, OUR ACTUAL 
COLLECTION
20:45:06 S OUTPERFORMED THE 
ESTIMATE BY
20:45:09  4.3 MILLION DOLLARS.
THE LARGEST CONTRIBUTE
20:45:12  TO THAT 
WAS SALES TAX.
WITH STRONG PERFORMANCE IN THE
20:45:15  
LAST QUARTER OF THE YEAR, AS 
PUBLIC SAFETY RESTRICTION
20:45:19 S WERE 
EASED.
BUSINESS TAX
20:45:22  AND PROPERTY 
TRANSFER TAX ALSO PERFORMED
20:45:25  
BETTER THAN ANTICIPATED.
ALTHOUGH THESE RESULTS ARE
20:45:28  
ENCOURAGING IT'S IMPORTANT TO 
RECOGNIZE THAT BOTH BUSINESS TAX
20:45:32  
AND HOTEL TAX ARE STILL 
SIGNIFICANTLY
20:45:35  BELOW THEIR 
PRE-PANDEMIC LEVELS.
20:45:38 
ADDITIONALLY, WE CAN EXPECT THAT 
THE SUMMER SURGE IN COVID CASES
20:45:41  
WILL HAVE HAD SOME IMPACT ON 
ECONOMIC ACTIVITY
20:45:45 .
AS NOTED ON THIS SLIDE, THE $20
20:45:49  
MILLION OF FISCAL RECOVERY
20:45:52  FUNDS 
WE RECEIVED FROM THE FEDERAL 
GOVERNMENT ARE INCLUDED
20:45:55  IN THE 
OTHER REVENUE CATEGORY.
YOU MAY RECALL
20:45:58  THAT WE'RE USING 
THIS FEDERAL ASSISTANCE TO
20:46:01  
REDUCE, TO RESTORE OR MAINTAIN 
SERVICES
20:46:05  IN THE CURRENT FISCAL 
YEAR, THAT WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE 
BEEN
20:46:08  CUT DUE TO Y
20:46:12  OUR REDUCED 
REVENUE.
20:46:17 
GENERAL RESOURCES
20:46:21  GREW FROM THE 
PRIOR YEAR.
WE HAVE NO
20:46:24  SIGNIFICANT REVENUE 
DATA YET FROM THE CURRENT FISCAL 
YEAR
20:46:28  BUT EXPECT TO RECEIVE SOME 
OF OUR FIRST PROPERTY TAX
20:46:31  AND 
SALES TAX REPRESENTED IN 
NOVEMBER
20:46:37  REMIT
20:46:40 TANCES
20:46:43  IN 
NOVEMBER AN DECEMBER.
11.2 MILLION WAS
20:46:47  PART OF OUR 
2020-21 BUDGET BALANCE
20:46:50 ING 
ACTIONS.
WE EXCEED THEY'D TARGET
20:46:53  BY ABOUT 
$2.5 MILLION WITH ALMOST
20:46:56  $2 
MILLION OF THAT IN THE POLICE
20:46:59  
AND FIRE DEPARTMENTS.
AS A REMINDER, THE
20:47:03  2021 BUDGET
20:47:06  
INCORPORATED $12 MILLION OF 
PANDEMIC RELATED BUDGET 

20:47:09 REDUCTIONS INCLUDING 
CONTINUATION OF THE HIRING 
FREEZE THAT BEGAN
20:47:13  IN MARCH 2020, 
AND THE SUSPENSION OF TRANSFERS
20:47:16  
FOR STREET, PARK, AND PUBLIC 
BUILDING MAINTENANCE
20:47:20 .
CAN YOU SEE THE SAVINGS IMPACT 
OF THAT
20:47:23  LAST ACTION IN THE 
CAPITAL PROJECTS ROW OF
20:47:26  THIS 
SLIDE BY COMPARING THE $5.
20:47:29 5 
MILLION TRANSFERRED IN 2019-20
20:47:32  
WITH THE ZERO-DOLLAR TRANSFER IN
20:47:35  
20-21.
AS I MENTIONED EARLIER, WE ARE
20:47:38  
USING A PORTION OF THE FEDERAL 
FISCAL
20:47:42  RECOVERY FOUND RESTORE 
THE TRANSFERS TO
20:47:44  THOSE 
MAINTENANCE PROGRAMS IN THE 
CURRENT FISCAL YEAR.

20:47:48 NEXT SLIDE, PLEASE.
WE
20:47:51  FINISHED 2019-20
20:47:55  WITH NO 
RESERVE FUND BALLOONS AND HAVING 
DRAWN DOWN
20:47:58  THE GENERAL FUND 
BUDGET UNCERTAINTY RESERVE BY
20:48:01  
$2.8 MILLION TO ITS CURRENT 
LEVEL
20:48:05  OF.5 MILLION .
THE
20:48:08  EXISTENCE OF THAT RESERVE 
ALLOWED FREMONT TO AVOID
20:48:11  THE 
MAJOR SERVICE REDUCTIONS THAT 
MANY OTHER AGENCIES HAVE BEEN 

20:48:14 FORCED TO EMPLOY.
IN THE ACTUALS
20:48:17  COLUMN CAN YOU 
SEE THE REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE 
ESTIMATES WOO
20:48:22  WE JUST REVIEWED AS 
WELL AS THE ADDITION OF $
20:48:25 1 
MILLION OF ENCUMBRANCES.
THOSE
20:48:28  ARE CONTRACTUAL 
OBLIGATIONS THAT REMAIN UNSPENT 
AT YEAR
20:48:31  END AND SERVE TO REDUCE 
THE ENDING UN
20:48:34 RESERVED FUND 
BALANCE.
BECAUSE THE 20
20:48:39 -21 ADOPTED BUDGET 
WAS LOWER THAN THE
20:48:42  19-20 BUDGET
20:48:45  
THE CONTINGENT DROPPED BY 1
20:48:48 .1 
MILLION FREEING UP RESOURCES FOR 
SERVICE
20:48:51  DELIVERY O.
THE UNRESERVED FUND BALANCE 
ESTIMATE SHOWN
20:48:55  IN THE GENERAL 
FUND FORECAST, THE $20 MILLION 
OF
20:48:58  FISCAL RECOVERY FUNDS, 
ASSUMED THAT OUR ESTIMATED 
REVENUES
20:49:01  WOULD JUST BE 
SUFFICIENT TO COVER OUR 
PROJECTED EXPENDITURES
20:49:05 , WITHOUT 
FURTHER REDUCING THE BUDGET UN
20:49:08 
UNCERTAINTY RESERVE.
INSTEAD, OUR HIGHER REVENUES AND
20:49:11  
LOWER EXPENDITURES LEAVE US WITH 
AN UNRESERVED
20:49:15  ENDING FUND 
BALANCE OF $25.8 MILLION.
20:49:18 
BECAUSE THE $20 MILLION OF 
FISCAL RECOVERY
20:49:21  FUNDS WERE 
APPROPRIATED TO BALANCE THE 
CURRENT YEAR BUDGET
20:49:25 , WE'RE LEFT 
WITH $5.8 MILLION OF
20:49:28  AVAILABLE 
ENDING FUND BALANCE.
NEXT SLIDE,
20:49:32  PLEASE.

20:49:35 THE ADOPTED BUDGET FUNDS THE 
GENERAL FUND
20:49:39  CONTINGENT RESERVE 
AT THE CITY COUNCIL POLICY LEVEL
20:49:42  
OF 16.
20:49:46 7% OF
20:49:49  BUDGET TRANSFERS 
OUTS, CONSISTENT WITH THE 
GOVERNMENT FINANCE
20:49:52  OFFICERS 
ASSOCIATION.
THE CONTINGENCY RESERVE IS
20:49:56  
PRIMARILY INTENDED TO PROVIDE 
IMMEDIATE COMMUNITY ASSISTANCE
20:49:59  
AND ENSURE SERVICE CONTINUITY IN 
THE FACE OF A
20:50:02  MAJOR DISASTER.
THE BUDGET UNCERTAINTY RESERVE
20:50:06  
ON THE OTHER HAND IS INTENDED TO 
SERVE AS A KIND OF SHOCK ABSORB
20:50:09 
ABSORBER TO DEAL WITH CYCLIC
20:50:12  
ECONOMIC DOWN TURNS AND CHANGES 
IN OUR COST STRUCTURE.

20:50:15 THE COUNCIL ADOPTED POLICY FOR 
THIS RESERVE IS TO FUND IT
20:50:18  AT A 
LEVEL CONSISTENT WITH THE 
REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE
20:50:22  
UNCERTAINTY OVER THE THREE-YEAR 
FORECAST PERIOD WITH THE
20:50:25  GOAL OF 
PROVIDING SUFFICIENT RESOURCES 
TO MAINTAIN
20:50:28  SERVICE LEVELS WHILE 
GIVING THE CITY AN OPPORTUNITY 
TO
20:50:32  RESPOND TO ITS BUDGETARY 
CHALLENGES.
20:50:35 
THE CURRENT BALANCE OF $
20:50:38 5 MANY 5 
MILLION IN THE BUDGET
20:50:42  
UNCERTAINTY RESERVE IS THE 
REMAINING OF THE 8.3
20:50:45  MILLION 
THAT WAS FUNDED IN THE 19-20 
ADOPTED
20:50:48  BUDGET.
 NEXT SLIDE PLEASE
20:50:52 .
IN SEPTEMBER, THE CITY COUNCIL 
APPROPRIATE
20:50:55 ED APPROXIMATELY 
$6th,000 OF THE
20:50:59  ENDING FUND 
BALANCE TO PURCHASE ENCRYPTION
20:51:03  
SOFTWARE AND INSTALL IT ON THE 
CITY'S PUBLIC SAFETY RADIOS
20:51:06 .
THAT LEAVES $5.
20:51:09 2 MILLION OF UN
20:51:16 
UNALLOCATED FUND BALANCE.
CAN
20:51:20  WE ADVANCE TO THE NEXT 
SLIDE, PLEASE
20:51:23 ?
20:51:27 
WELL I GUESS WE'VE STALLED ON 
THE RESERVE SLIDE.

20:51:30 BUT I'LL KEEP GOING.

20:51:34 AS STAFF HIGHLIGHTED, WHEN THE
20:51:37  
FISCAL YEAR 2021-22 PROPOSED 
BUDGET WAS PRESENTED
20:51:41  TO THE CITY 
COUNCIL LAST MAY, RESTORING
20:51:44  THE 
GENERAL FUND BUDGET UNCERTAINTY 
RESERVE TO ITS
20:51:47  PREPANDEMIC LEVEL 
WOULD BE A PRIORITY TO THE 
EXTENT RESOURCES
20:51:51  BECAME 
AVAILABLE.
THE CITY COUNCIL
20:51:54  ESTABLISHED THE 
GENERAL FUND BUDGET UNCERTAINTY
20:51:57  
RESERVE AT $8.3 MILLION AS PART 
OF
20:52:00  THE 19-20 ADOPTED OPERATING 
BUDGET.
WHICH
20:52:04  AT THE TIME, REPRESENTED 
APPROXIMATELY THREE YEARS
20:52:07  OF 
PROJECTED REVENUE RISK.
I'M GOING
20:52:10  TO GO AHEAD AND SHARE 
MY SCREEN SO THAT WE
20:52:15  CAN TAKE A
20:52:18  
LOOK AT THE REST OF THE SLIDES 
THAT WE HAVE
20:52:21 .
LET ME FIND IT HERE.

20:52:29 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

20:52:37 THE
20:52:44 >> David Persselin:  ,
20:52:47  SOUNDS 
LIKE
20:52:54  ALBERTO HAS GOT US BACK TO 
SPEED.
>> The Clerk:  
20:52:57  I'M SORRY DAVE, 
THE
20:53:00  ZOOM HAS DROPPED GETTING 
BACK UP HERE
20:53:03 .
>> David Persselin:   THE CITY 
ESTABLISHED THE BUDGET
20:53:06  
UNCERTAINTY RESERVE AT 8.3 
MILLION, AS
20:53:09  PART OF THE 19-20 
OPERATING FUND
20:53:13  BUDGETS WHICH AT 
THE TIME REPRESENTED THREE
20:53:16  YEARS 
OF BUDGET RISK
20:53:20 .
POTENTIAL FOR INCREASES OF UN
20:53:23 
UNFUNDED PENSION LIABILITY
20:53:26  
RESOURCES, THE GENERAL FUND HAS
20:53:29  
INCREASED OVER THE PAST TWO 
YEARS.

20:53:32 OVER THE FORECAST PERIOD, OUR 
MOST
20:53:35  ECONOMICALLY SENSITIVE 
REVENUES SALES TAX, BUSINESS TAX
20:53:38 
TAX, HOTEL TAX AND A PORTION OF 
OUR PROPERTY TAX
20:53:41  ARE PROJECTED 
TO GROW BY ABOUT $10 MILLION
20:53:46 .
ACCORDINGLY, STAFF IS 
RECOMMENDING THAT THE
20:53:49  YOU 
GENERAL FUND BUDGET UNCERTAINTY 
RESERVE NOT
20:53:52  ONLY BE RESTORED TO 
ITS PRE-PANDEMIC
20:53:56  LEVEL BUT ALSO 
INCREASE TO $10 MILLION USING
20:53:59  
$4.5 MILLION OF THE AVAILABLE 
END
20:54:02 ING FUND BALANCE.
THE LACK OF RESOURCES DO SUPPORT
20:54:05  
CAPITAL PROJECTS DURING THE PAST 
TWO
20:54:09  BUDGET CYCLES HAS RESULTED 
IN THE PARTIAL DEFUNDING
20:54:12  OF SOME 
COUNCIL APPROVED PROJECTS TO 
ENSURE COMPLETION
20:54:15  OF OTHERS.
STAFF RECOMMENDS TRANSFERRING
20:54:19  
THE REMAINING ENDING FUND 
BALANCE OF APPROXIMATELY $
20:54:22 
$700,000 TO THE CAPITAL 
IMPROVEMENT FUND AS A SOURCE FOR
20:54:25  
RESTORING THE NECESSARY FUNDING 
AS CONTRACTS FOR THOSE
20:54:28  DEFUNDED 
PROJECTS ARE BROUGHT TO THE CITY 
COUNCIL FOR AWARD.

20:54:37 NEXT SLIDE, PLEASE.

20:54:42 THANKS.
THE RESOLUTION ADOPT ED
20:54:45 ED BY THE 
CITY COUNCIL TO
20:54:48  IMPLEMENT THE 
ANNUAL OPERATING BUDGET
20:54:52  ALSO 
INCLUDES AUTHORIZATION FOR THE 
CITY COUNCIL TO TAKE
20:54:55  CERTAIN 
ADDITIONAL APPROPRIATION ACTIONS 
BUT WITH THE REQUIREMENT TO 

20:54:58 REPORT BACK ON THESE ACTIONS AT 
YEAR END.
THE AMOUNT OF
20:55:01  INCREASED 
APPROPRIATIONS FOR CURRENT 
FISCAL YEAR DUE
20:55:04  TO UNEXPENDED 
PRIOR YEAR ENCUMBRANCES
20:55:08  IS $22.5 
MILLION.
MOST OF THAT CARRY
20:55:11 OVER, ALMOST 
$16 MILLION, IS IN THE CAPITAL
20:55:15  
PROJECT FUNDS WITH ANOTHER $1 
MILLION IN THE GENERAL FUND.

20:55:19 IN ADDITION TO APPROPRIATING THE 
ENCUMBRANCE
20:55:23  BALANCES THE CITY 
MANAGER ALSO APPROVED THE 
APPROPRIATION OF
20:55:26  UNANTICIPATED 
GRANT FEE
20:55:29  AND DONATION REVENUES 
THAT WHICH ARE RECEIVED
20:55:36  WHICH WERE RECEIVED DURING 
THE FISCAL YEAR.
AMONG
20:55:39  THOSE WAS THE EMERGENCY
20:55:43  RENTAL 
EMERGENCY
20:55:45  ASSISTANCE GRANT 
RECEIVED FROM THE FEDERAL 
GOVERNMENT.

20:55:48 NEXT SLIDE, PLEASE.
20:55:52 
IN SUMMARY, LAST YEAR'S REVENUE 
PERFORMANCE
20:55:55  WAS BETTER THAN 
EXPECTED, BUT WE CONTINUE DO
20:55:58  
FACE SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC 
UNCERTAINTY
20:56:01 .
WE HAVE NO SIGNIFICANT REVENUE 
DATA YET FOR
20:56:05  THIS YEAR BUT 
EXPECT TO RECEIVE SOME OF OUR 
FIRST PROPERTY TAX
20:56:08  AND SALES TAX
20:56:13  
REMITTANCES IN NOVEMBER AND 
DECEMBER.

20:56:16 THE ANTICIPATED REVENUES AND 
SLIGHTLY
20:56:19  BETTER THAN EXPECTED 
EXPENDITURES, LEAVES US
20:56:22  WITH $5 
MILLION IN UNRESERVED FUND 
BALANCE
20:56:25 .
AS THE CITY COUNCIL HAS
20:56:28  
PREVIOUSLY APPROPRIATED 600,000 
OF THAT, STAFF
20:56:32  IS RECOMMENDING 
THAT $4.5
20:56:35  MILLION BE ALLOCATED 
TO RESTORE
20:56:39  AND
20:56:42  TRANSFERRED TO 
THE CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT FOUND 
SUPPORT
20:56:46  PREVIOUSLY APPROVED 
CAPITAL PROJECTS.
OVERALL TONIGHT'S REPORT
20:56:49  HAS 
SHARED GOOD NEWS BUT IT'S 
IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER
20:56:53  T
20:56:57  THAT THE 
GENERAL FUND FORECAST, 
MAINTAINED SERVICE LEVELS OVER
20:57:00  
THE NEXT TWO FISCAL YEARS, WHILE 
OUR
20:57:03  REVENUES RECOVER.
THAT MEANS THAT UNLESS WE SEE 
STRONGER
20:57:07  THAN ANTICIPATED 
REVENUE PERFORMANCE IN THE 
CURRENT FISCAL YEAR
20:57:11 , OUR ABILITY 
TO EXPAND OR
20:57:14  ENHANCE SERVICES TO 
THE COMMUNITY WILL BE VERY 
LIMITED.
20:57:16 
TRUSTEE SWEENEY NEXT SLIDE 
PLEASE.

20:57:20 NEXT SLIDE PLEASE
20:57:23 .
WE PLAN TO PRESENT THE MID YEAR 
BUDGET REVIEW
20:57:27  ON MARCH 1st AND 
THE PROPOSED OPERATING BUDGET 
FOR THE
20:57:30  NEXT FISCAL YEAR ON MAY 
17th.
THE FIRST PUBLIC HEARING ON
20:57:33  THE 
PROPOSED BUDGET WILL BE HELD ON 
JUNE 7th
20:57:36 , WITH THE SECOND 
PUBLIC HEARING AND BUDGET
20:57:38  
ADOPTION SCHEDULED FOR JUNE 
14th.

20:57:43 I'VE COMPLETED MY PRESENTATION, 
AND WILL RETURN THE FLOOR
20:57:46  TO THE 
MAYOR FOR QUESTIONS AND 
DISCUSSION
20:57:49 .
20:57:53 
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU FOR 
THIS UPDATE AND I WANTED TO 

20:57:56 FIRST SEE IF THERE ARE ANY 
QUESTIONS FROM ANY OF THE 
COUNCILMEMBERS.

20:57:59 I'LL BEGIN WITH COUNCILMEMBER 
KASSAN
20:58:00 .
>> Councilmember Kassan:   THANK 
YOU.

20:58:03 WHAT IS THE STATUS OF THE HIRING 
FREEZE
20:58:06 ?
>> David Persselin:   SO THE 
HIRING FREEZE ENDED AT THE END 

20:58:10 OF THE LAST FISCAL YEAR.
SO THERE IS NO LONGER A HIRING 
FREEZE
20:58:13 .
>> Councilmember Kassan:   OKAY.
BECAUSE I JUST -- I WAS LOOKING 

20:58:17 AT WHAT WAS HAPPENING WITH 
ANIMAL SERVICES, AND
20:58:20  I WAS -- I 
HAD BEEN TOLD BY SOMEONE
20:58:24  THAT 
THERE IS STILL A POSITION THAT'S 
OPEN AND UNFILLED
20:58:27  AND THERE'S A 
HOLD ON FILLING IT, JUST AING HE
20:58:31  AS AN 
EXAMPLE
20:58:34 .
ARE THERE ANY OPEN AND
20:58:37  UNFILLED 
POSITIONS JUST
20:58:41  IN RELATION TO 
BEING UNFILLED?
20:58:45 
>> David Persselin:   WE DO HAVE 
CAPACITY
20:58:48  WITHIN OUR RESOURCES 
DEPARTMENT.
AND WHEN WE ENDED THE HIRING
20:58:51  
FREEZE WE ASKED ALL DEPARTMENTS 
WITH A BACKLOG
20:58:55  OF FROZEN 
POSITIONS TO PROVIDE US A 
PRIORITIZE
20:58:57 ATION FOR BEGINNING 
RECRUITMENTS.
SO I BELIEVE THAT THE HUMAN 

20:59:01 RESOURCES DEPARTMENT IS WORKING 
ITS WAY THROUGH THAT
20:59:04  BACKLOG.
BUT AGAIN, THERE ARE NO 
POSITIONS THAT ARE BEING
20:59:07  HELD 
VACANT FOR BUDGETARY REASONS.

20:59:12 >> Councilmember Kassan:   OKAY.
I'M JUST WONDERING IF IT
20:59:15  WOULD 
BE HELPFUL TO ALLOCATE A SMALL 
PORTION OF THESE FUNDS TOWARDS
20:59:18  
FILLING OF POSITIONS.
BECAUSE I KNOW IT'S A HARD TIME 

20:59:21 TO DO THAT.
AND I HATE TO SEE OUR STAFF 
OPERATING WITHOUT THE
20:59:25  FULL 
CAPACITY TO DO DECLARE JOBS
20:59:28 .
>> David Persselin:   SO THE 
BUDGET
20:59:31  IS IN PLACE FOR ALL 
VACANT POSITIONS.
>> Councilmember Kassan:  
20:59:34  
RIGHT, I UNDERSTAND THAT.
I JUST MEANT SHOULD WE ALLOCATE
20:59:37  
ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR 
RECRUITMENT SO WE COULD MORE 

20:59:41 EASILY FILL THOSE POSITIONS IF 
THERE IS A BACKLOG AS
20:59:44  YOU SAID 
AND BECAUSE IT IS AN ESPECIALLY 
DIFFICULT TIME TO RECRUIT
20:59:46  PEOPLE 
RIGHT NOW.
>> David Persselin:   MY 

20:59:49 UNDERSTANDING IS -- I'LL LET THE 
HUMAN RESOURCES DIRECTOR RESPOND
20:59:53 
RESPOND.
>> I'M NOT
20:59:56  SURE ALLEN IS ON BUT 
WHAT I WILL SHARE WITH
21:00:00  YOU, 
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN AND
21:00:03  THE 
REST OF THE COUNCIL, IS THAT THE 
HUMAN RESOURCES DEPARTMENT
21:00:07  IS 
AGGRESSIVELY TRYING TO FILLING 
ALL OF THE VACANCIES
21:00:10  THAT THEY 
HAVE IN THEIR DEPARTMENT.
SO THAT THEY
21:00:14  CAN BETTER 
FACILITATE RECRUITMENT
21:00:17 S.
AND THEY'RE USING ALL
21:00:21  THE 
CREATIVITY THAT THEY HAVE TO 
BRING
21:00:25  PEOPLE IN.
UNFORTUNATELY, IN THIS ECONOMY,
21:00:29  
WE'VE EXTENDED SOME OFFERS TO 
PEOPLE FOR SOME
21:00:32  OF THE VACANCIES 
IN HUMAN RESOURCES AND THOSE 
PEOPLE
21:00:35  HAVE DECIDED TO EITHER 
STAY WHERE THEY WERE
21:00:38  OR TAKE 
OTHER OFFERS,
21:00:41  EVEN AFTER 
ACCEPTING OURS.
SO WE'RE LOOKING AT
21:00:45  SOME 
CREATIVE SOLUTIONS TO MAKE SURE 
THAT WE HAVE FOLKS IN PLACE
21:00:49  TO 
GET OUR VACANCIES FILLED AND
21:00:53  AS 
EXPEDITIOUSLY AS POSSIBLE.
AND THE OTHER THING IS THAT
21:00:56  IT'S 
NOT JUST ON THE HUMAN RESOURCES 
DEPARTMENT.
21:00:59 
BUT IT ALSO RELIES ON
21:01:02  THE 
EXPEDIENCY OF THE
21:01:06  HIRING 
MANAGERS IN EACH OF THE
21:01:09  
DEPARTMENTS.
AND I MUST SAY EACH DEPARTMENT 

21:01:12 IS DOING AWONDERFUL JOB AND 
BEING RESPONSIVE TO THE NEEDS
21:01:15  
AND REQUESTS OF THE HUMAN 
RESOURCES DEPARTMENT AS WE WORK 

21:01:18 TO GET THE VACANCIES FILLED.

21:01:21 BUT UNFORTUNATELY, THE VACANCIES 
ARE THERE
21:01:24 .
BUT I THINK WE'RE ON THE RIGHT 
PATH TOWARDS GETTING SOME
21:01:27  OF 
THEM FILLED.
21:01:30 
BUT YEAH, GREAT.
GREAT QUESTION.
21:01:34 
EVERYONE'S DEALING WITH THAT.
I THINK THEY CALL IT
21:01:37  THE -- I 
READ SOMETHING THEY CALLED IT 
THE
21:01:41  GREAT RESIGNATION KIND OF 
LIKE THE GREAT RECESSION.
21:01:44 
SO PEOPLE ARE JUST, AH, FORGET
21:01:46  
THIS.
SO WE'RE DOING OUR VERY BEST.

21:01:50 BUT YOUR CONCERN IS WELL 
RECEIVED AND UNDERSTOOD
21:01:53 .
THANK YOU.
THE.

21:01:56 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.
CLARIFYING QUESTIONS AT THIS 
TIME,
21:01:59  VICE MAYOR SHAO.

21:02:03 >> Councilmember Shao:   WHY 
THANK YOU MADAM MAYOR.
21:02:06 
IT'S OBVIOUS THAT WE RECEIVED 
$20 MILLION OF EMERGENCY
21:02:09  FUND 
FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AS 
WELL AS THE RENTAL FUND OF $
21:02:12 7.2 
MILLION.
THAT ACTUALLY IS
21:02:16  A BIG CHUNK.
21:02:19 
SO AT THE END OF YOUR 
PRESENTATION, YOU
21:02:22  MENTIONED 
UNCERTAINTY IN THE FUTURE.
21:02:25 
MY QUESTION WOULD BE, IS THERE
21:02:28  
ANY INDICATION THAT WE WILL
21:02:31  
RECEIVE ANY FUNDS LIKE THAT FROM 
THE FEDERAL
21:02:34  GOVERNMENT?
AND IF SO, ANY INDICATION AS
21:02:38  TO 
THE SCALE OR THE AMOUNT
21:02:42 ?
>> David Persselin:   SO AS YOU 
MAY RECALL, WE ARE RECEIVING A
21:02:46  
SECOND INSTALLMENT OF FEDERAL 
FISCAL
21:02:49  RECOVERY FUNDS SOMETIME 
EITHER AT THE
21:02:52  END OF THIS FISCAL 
YEAR OR AT THE BEGINNING OF NEXT 
FISCAL YEAR
21:02:56 .
AND WE'VE PROGRAMMED THAT
21:02:59  A
21:03:03  IN THE 
FORECAST TO BALANCE THE GENERAL 
FUND BUDGET OVER THE NEXT TWO
21:03:06  
YEARS AS REVENUES RECOVER.
SO THAT'S $22
21:03:09  MILLION THAT WE 
SHOULD BE RECEIVING SOMETIME 
WITHIN
21:03:12  THE NEXT ROUGHLY NINE 
MONTHS
21:03:16 .
WE ALSO, IN ADDITION TO THE
21:03:19  $7.2 
MILLION, THAT WAS THE --
21:03:22  WHAT 
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS NOW 
CALLING THE
21:03:25  EMERGENCY RENTAL 
ASSISTANCE
21:03:28  PROGRAM 1 ROUND OF 
FUNDING.
WE'VE
21:03:32  ACTUALLY RECEIVED TWO 
ADDITIONAL INSTALLMENTS UNDER 
THE SECOND
21:03:35  ROUND OF ERAP FUNDING
21:03:39  FUNDING 
TOTALING AGAIN ROUGHLY SEVEN TO
21:03:42  
$8 MILLION AND THAT AGAIN IS 
MONEY THAT SPECIFICALLY
21:03:45  
EARMARKED TO PROVIDE EMERGENCY
21:03:49  
RENTAL ASSISTANCE FOR PEOPLE IN 
OUR COMMUNITY
21:03:52 .
SO THOSE ARE THE -- THOSE ARE 
SORT OF THE LARGE
21:03:55 EST PIECES OF 
FUNDING THAT
21:03:58  WE HAVE RECEIVED, 
OR ARE CURRENTLY PROGRAMMED
21:04:01  TO 
RECEIVE.
AS YOU MAY BE AWARE, THERE ARE
21:04:05  
OTHER OPPORTUNITIES WITHIN
21:04:08  THE
21:04:12 
THE -- I'M SORRY, THE ARP
21:04:16 A 
RECOVERY ACT THAT WE ARE
21:04:19  
PURSUINGS AS WELL.
BUT THOSE
21:04:22  ARE THE MAIN PIECES 
RIGHT NOW.
>> Councilmember Shao:  
21:04:25  AND OUT 
OF THE $7.2 MILLION
21:04:29  EMERGENCY 
RENTAL FUNDING THAT WE RECEIVED 
FROM THE GOVERNMENT, HOW MUCH 

21:04:32 DID WE SPEND?
21:04:36 
>> David Persselin:   I DON'T 
KNOW HOW MUCH WE'VE SPENT TO 

21:04:39 DATE.
I KNOW THAT WHETHER WE APPLIED 
FOR THE ROUND
21:04:42  2 FUNDING, ABOUT A 
MONTH AGO
21:04:45 , WE HAD SPENT ABOUT 75
21:04:49 
75% OF THE FIRST ROUND
21:04:51 .
>> Councilmember Shao:   THANK 
YOU.

21:04:55 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.
CLARIFYING QUESTIONS,
21:04:58  
COUNCILMEMBER KENG.

21:05:02 >> Councilmember Keng:   THANK 
YOU, MADAM MAYOR.
SO MY QUESTION IS ALSO YEAH,
21:05:05  ONE 
GOT ANSWERED, HOW MUCH HAVE WE 
SPENT ON THE
21:05:08  RENTAL ASSISTANCE.
AND ALSO
21:05:11 , FOR THE -- FOR 
RECOMMENDATION NUMBER 3,
21:05:14  
TRANSFER ANY REMAINING GENERAL 
FUND
21:05:17  IN RESERVE TO CAPITAL
21:05:20  
IMPROVEMENT FUND.
SO DO YOU KNOW WHAT KIND
21:05:23  OF 
ITEMS ARE BEING WORKED ON WITH 
THIS FUNDING
21:05:28 ?
21:05:32 
>> David Persselin:   SURE.
SO AS I WAS MENTIONING BEFORE, 

21:05:36 IN THIS PAST FISCAL YEAR, WE DID 
NOT DO OUR
21:05:39  TYPICAL ANNUAL 
TRANSFER OF FUNDS TO THE
21:05:43  CAPITAL 
IMPROVEMENT FUND THAT ARE USED 
TO
21:05:47  PROVIDE BOTH MAINTENANCE 
SERVICES AND ALSO
21:05:51  ANY ADDITIONS 
FOR CAPITAL PROJECTS.
21:05:54 
SO AS A RESULT, WE HAD SOME 
CAPITAL PROJECTS
21:05:58  THAT AROSE 
DURING THE COURSE OF THE YEAR 
LIKE
21:06:01 , FOR EXAMPLE, THE ROOF AT 
THE
21:06:04  FAMILY RESOURCE CENTER 
FAILED.
21:06:08 
AND
21:06:11  SO THAT WAS AN ABSOLUTE 
PROJECT THAT HAD TO BE COMPLETED
21:06:14 
COMPLETED.
SO WE TOOK FUNDING FROM OTHER 

21:06:17 PROJECTS IN ORDER TO COMPLETE 
THAT.
ONE OF THOSE FOR EXAMPLE IS THE 

21:06:20 POLICE STORAGE EVIDENCE FACILITY 
PROJECT THAT IS DUE
21:06:23  FOR A 
CONTRACT AWARD NEXT YEAR
21:06:28 .
21:06:33 
SO AS A RESULT, THAT PROJECT 
WHICH HAD BEEN AWARDED FULL
21:06:37  
FUNDING BY THE CITY COUNCIL 
CURRENTLY DOES NOT HAVE
21:06:40  
SUFFICIENT FUNDING.
SO THE IDEA HERE IS TO RESTORE 

21:06:44 THAT FUNDING IN ORDER TO AWARD 
THE CONTRACT NEXT YEAR.

21:06:49 >> Councilmember Keng:   GREAT, 
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

21:06:52 AND I JUST WANTED -- I'M GOING 
TO
21:06:56  OPEN IN JUST A MOMENT FOR 
PUBLIC COMMENT.
I JUST WANTED TO MENTION THAT 

21:06:59 DURING THE STATE OF THE CITY 
THAT WE SHARED FOR
21:07:02  KEY FREMONT 
HOUSE FOR REGISTER ASSISTANCE WE 
TO DATE
21:07:05  HAVE HELPED ABOUT 583 
HOUSEHOLDS AND HAVE
21:07:08  DISTRIBUTED 
MORE THAN 8.1 MILLION SO
21:07:12  FAR.
SO JUST IN CASE, JUST TO SHARE 
WITH THE
21:07:14  PUBLIC.
LET'S SEE IF WE HAVE ANY PUBLIC 
COMMENTS.

21:07:18 I'M GOING TO OPEN IT FOR PUBLIC 
COMMENT TIP
21:07:22  THE AT THIS POINT.
>> The Clerk:  
21:07:25  AT THIS POINT
21:07:29 .
>> The Clerk:   MR. BEEKMAN HAS 
HIS HAND
21:07:32  RAISED DO WE HAVE TWO 
MINUTES ALSO?
>> I
21:07:36  THINK COUNCILMEMBER COX HAS 
HER
21:07:39  HAND RISED AS WELL.
>> Mayor Mei:   CLARIFYING 
COMMENTS.
21:07:42 
>> Councilmember Cox:   I'D LIKE 
WITH THE EMERGENCY FUND ANY OF
21:07:46  
IT BEING USED IS ANY OF IT BEING 
USED FOSTER
21:07:50  FOR UNHOUSED YOUTH
21:07:54 ?
21:07:59 
>> David Persselin:   GRON W
21:08:03 I DON'T KNOW 
IF WE HAVE ANYBODY ON THE PANEL
21:08:07  
FROM SUPPORT SERVICES THAT CAN 
HELP
21:08:11 .
SHFL I'M
21:08:21 .
>> IN ARREARS WITH RENT OR 
UTILITIES,
21:08:24  SO THOSE ARE SORT OF 
THE PARAMETERS FOR
21:08:27  UTILIZATION 
OF THOSE DOLLARS
21:08:30 .
HMM THEY THE
21:08:33  ARE STRUCTURED 
AROUND THAT.
>> Councilmember Cox:   AND WITH 

21:08:37 THE FUNDING WITH THE FAMILY 
RESOURCE CENTER IS THERE
21:08:40  ANY 
FUNDING THAT'S BEING USED FOR 
GETTING PEOPLE
21:08:43  BACK TO WORK OR 
WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT
21:08:46  DEVELOPMENT ARE USING 
THAT FOR SCHOLARSHIPS TO GO TO
21:08:50  
THE LOCAL OHLONE COLLEGE OR 
OTHER LOCAL
21:08:53  COLLEGES?
I'M JUST CURIOUS WITH THIS TYPE 
OF FUNDING
21:08:56 , HOW IT'S BEING 
UTILIZED.

21:09:05 >> Suzanne Shenfil:   NOT FOR 
THIS FUNDING, AS
21:09:08  IT'S PRESCRIBED 
FOR RENTAL ASSISTANCE ONLY
21:09:11 .
>> Councilmember Cox:   NO NO, 
THERE WAS OVER $
21:09:15 470,000, $4
21:09:18 
$472,000, WAS THERE ANYTHING EAR 
MARKED IN PARTICULAR FOR
21:09:21  WHAT 
USE?
>> Suzanne Shenfil:   NOT
21:09:24  
SPECIFICALLY FOR EMPLOYMENT 
RELATED ACTIVITIES
21:09:28 .
THOUGH WE DO WORK WITH PEOPLE
21:09:31  
THROUGH OUR SPARK POINT PROGRAM 
TO DO COUNSELING
21:09:34  AND TO DO JOB 
REFERRALS.
AND ASSISTANCE.
21:09:37 
BUT NOTHING FOR SCHOLARSHIPS PER 
SE.

21:09:45 >> Councilmember Cox:   OKAY.
I'D BE
21:09:48  CURIOUS TO SEE WHAT ELSE 
WE CAN DO TO HELP IN
21:09:52  THAT AREA, 
AS WELL.
I GUESS AS WE GET
21:09:55  ADDITIONAL 
FUNDING, I GUESS THOSE ARE 
THINGS TO BE DECIDED
21:09:58  AS THE 
MONEY COMES IN IN THE SECOND OR 
THE END
21:10:03  OF FISCAL YEAR --
>> Mayor Mei:   THE SECOND
21:10:06  
TRANCHE OF MONEY I BELIEVE 
THAT'S COMING THROUGH FOR
21:10:09  THE 
ERAP PROGRAM IS GOING TO 
PROBABLY HAVE CONSISTENT
21:10:12  
GUIDELINES WITH THE ONES THAT WE 
HAVE CURRENTLY.

21:10:15 BECAUSE THAT WASN'T DIVIDEDINTO
21:10:18  
TWO TRANCHES BUT IT WILL HAVE 
LIKELY THE SIMILAR GUIDELINES 

21:10:21 WHICH IS SPECIFICALLY TO ADDRESS 
RENTAL ASSISTANCE TO KEEP PEOPLE 
FROM
21:10:25  BEING UNHOUSED AS WELL AS 
THEIR UTILITY BILLS
21:10:27 .
SO MORE THAN --
>> Councilmember Cox:   I WAS 

21:10:31 REFERRING TO THE SYSTEM RESOURCE 
CENTER IF WE GET ADDITIONAL YOU 
MONEY WOULD
21:10:34  THAT BE EARMARKED 
FOR THE SAME PURPOSE OR 
DIFFERENT?

21:10:37 I UNDERSTAND ABOUT THE RENTAL 
HOUSING.
I GET THAT.
21:10:40 
JUST SEEKING SOME CLARIFICATION 
ON THE RESOURCE
21:10:43 S TO BE
21:10:47  USED AT 
THE FAMILY RESOURCE CENTER 
GRANTS
21:10:50 .
>> Mayor Mei:   SUZANNE IS THAT 
TIED TO
21:10:54  OUR COMMUNITY BLOCK 
GRANTS?
>> Suzanne Shenfil:  
21:10:57  NO IT'S 
NOT BUT WE RECEIVED A LOT OF 
DONATION THE
21:11:00  LAST YEAR, A LOT OF 
THAT WAS FOR FOOD ASSISTANCE FOR 
FAMILIES
21:11:03  AND OTHER NECESSITIES.
WE ALSO HAD A
21:11:06  GRANT TO HELP 
PEOPLE AND A HALF
21:11:09  NAVIGATE FINANCIAL 
DIFFICULTIES THEY
21:11:12  WERE HAVING 
BECAUSE OF COVID.
SO A LOT OF THAT WAS CONNECT
21:11:14 ING 
PEOPLE TO RESOURCES IN THE 
COMMUNITY.

21:11:17 BUT NOT SPECIFICALLY JOB-RELATE
21:11:21 ED 
THINGS.
>> Councilmember Cox:   OKAY,
21:11:25  OR 
EDUCATION TYPE PURPOSES.
>> Suzanne Shenfil:   RIGHT
21:11:28 .
>> Councilmember Cox:   WOULD 
ANY OF THIS MONEY BE USED FOR
21:11:31  
THE AFGHAN REFUGEES THAT MIGHT 
BE COMING TO OUR
21:11:35  COMMUNITY?
IS THAT SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE 
COVERED UNDER THIS TYPE OF 

21:11:38 FUNDING?
>> Suzanne Shenfil:   SO WE MAY 
HAVE AS YOU MAY KNOW ESTABLISHED
21:11:42  
AN AFGHAN REFUGEE HELP FUND AND 
RAISED
21:11:45  ALMOST $300,000.
SO WE ARE GETTING REQUESTS
21:11:48  FROM 
DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS WHO ARE 
BEGINNING TO
21:11:52  ASSIST REFUGEES 
COMING INTO OUR AREA.
21:11:56 
AGAIN, HOUSING IS THE BIGGEST 
NEED FOR
21:11:59  THOSE HOUSEHOLDS.
AND WE HAVE
21:12:02  RECENTLY FORMED A 
MULTIDISCIPLINARY GROUP
21:12:06  OF 
AGENCIES WORKING TOGETHER.
WE'VE HAD OUR
21:12:09  SECOND MEETING 
TODAY AND JOB PLACEMENT
21:12:12  WAS 
BEGINNING TO BE DISCUSSED.
SO I THINK THAT WILL
21:12:16  BE COMING 
UP SHORTLY AS AN ISSUE WHICH
21:12:20  
NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED.

21:12:23 >> Councilmember Cox:   WOULD 
THAT FUNDING BE COVERED UNDER
21:12:26  
THE FAMILY RESOURCE CENTER?
GRANTS THAT
21:12:29  YOU'RE GETTING?
>> Suzanne Shenfil:   NO, THAT'S 
SITTING IN
21:12:36  
SITTING IN A SEPARATE FUND.
AFGHAN RELIEF
21:12:39 .
>> Councilmember Cox:   RIGHT, I 
UNDERSTAND WE HAVE OUR OWN 

21:12:42 SEPARATE FUND DEDICATED FOR THAT 
BUT I'M JUST WONDERING IF THERE 
WAS
21:12:45  SURPLUS MONEY THAT WOULD 
ALSO BE
21:12:49  USED TO ASSIST THE 
RFERTION THAT MAY COME TO
21:12:53  OUR 
COMMUNITY IN CASE THE MAIN FUND 
GETS
21:12:57  EXHAUSTED OR HAS 
INSUFFICIENT FUNDS TO CARRY OUT 
TO HELP OTHERS
21:13:00 .
SO I'M JUST TRYING TO FIND OUT 
IF THERE IS ANOTHER STREAMLINE
21:13:03  
OF MONEYS TO HELP IN THAT PART, 
WITH THE NEW
21:13:07  INCREASED
21:13:11  REVENUE 
THAT WE'RE GETTING LISTED ON 
PAGE 8
21:13:14 .
>> Suzanne Shenfil:   WELL, THAT 
APPEARS TO BE NEW REVENUE.

21:13:17 A LOT OF THAT WAS SPENT REVENUE 
IN THIS LAST COVID YEAR
21:13:20 .
SO I DON'T THINK THAT WE HAVE A 
LOT
21:13:24  OF EXCESS
21:13:27  FUNDS REMAINING.
THE SOURCE WE WOULD TAP FIRST 
WOULD BE
21:13:30  THE RELIEF FUND 
SPECIFICALLY AND WE'VE ALLOCATE
21:13:34 ED 
BOANL
21:13:37  
ONLY ABOUT A THIRD OF WHAT WE'VE 
RECEIVED SO
21:13:40  FAR.
SO WE'RE ACCEPTING
21:13:45  DONATIONS 
FROM ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE
21:13:48  
HELPING REFUGEES IN A VARIETY OF 
DIFFERENT WAYS.

21:13:50 >> Councilmember Cox:   THANK 
YOU VERY MUCH.
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

21:13:53 AT THIS TIME I'M GOING TO OPEN 
THE PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD OR 
QUESTIONS TO
21:13:56  SEE, MR. BEEKMAN, 
TWO MINUTES PLEASE
21:14:00 .
>> HI, THANK YOU.
21:14:03 
BLAIR BEEKMAN HERE.
THANK YOU A LOT FOR
21:14:07  THIS ITEM.
YOU KNOW, THIS WAS A BIT
21:14:10  
DIFFERENT FOR MYSELF THAN I 
THINK THERE WAS A BUDGET REPORT
21:14:13  
MAYBE SIX MONTHS AGO THAT I FELT
21:14:16  
THIS ONE WAS A BIT MORE CLEAR 
AND UNDERSTANDABLE FOR MYSELF
21:14:19 .
THANK YOU.
IT WAS VERY NICE TO LEARN
21:14:22  THAT 
YOU'LL BE DOING SOME GENERAL 
FUNDING
21:14:26  THINGS.
THANK YOU FOR REPORTING THAT
21:14:30  
IT'S THE GENERAL FUNDING THAT 
CAN BE
21:14:33  GIVEN FROM THE FEDERAL 
LEVEL,
21:14:36  MAYBE FOR THE NEXT FEW 
FISCAL YEARS.
THAT'S
21:14:39  IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR 
MYSELF.
21:14:42 
I'M VERY CONCERNED CONCERNED 
ABOUT THE YEAR 20
21:14:46 23.
AND WHAT EXACTLY THAT MEANS AND
21:14:49  
HOW WE PLAN FOR OURSELVES, AS 
LOCAL COMMUNITIES
21:14:52  IN THE BAY 
AREA.
I HOPE IT'S A SUBJECT WE
21:14:55  CAN 
LEARN TO TALK OPENLY ABOUT AND 
MORE OPENLY ABOUT
21:15:00 .
WHAT DO WE GO OIN THE NEXT YEAR 
COMPARED
21:15:04  TO THE NEXT TWO YEARS 
COMPARED TO THE NEXT THREE OR 
FOUR YEARS
21:15:07  AND HOUSE TO TALK 
ABOUT THE DIFFERENCES IN THAT IT 
WILL BE IMPORTANT
21:15:10  I THINK IN 
THIS NEXT, COMING YEAR HOW
21:15:13  TO DO 
THAT FOR OURSELVES SO WE
21:15:17  CAN 
UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER SO PEOPLE 
AREN'T GOING OFF IN ALL
21:15:20  WEIRD 
DIRECTIONS, IF THIS SORT OF 
CONVERSATION IS NEEDED
21:15:23 .
BECAUSE I HAVE FEARS OF, YOU 
KNOW, A
21:15:26  POSSIBLE NATURAL 
DISASTER IN THE YEAR 2023
21:15:30 .
AND IT'S IMPORTANT IF I'M 
CORRECT THAT WE LEARN
21:15:33  HOW TO 
HAVE THAT SORT OF CONVERSATION 
WITH
21:15:36  OURSELVES OPENLY AND 
PUBLICLY.
21:15:40 
AND WE'RE DOING THAT HERE AND I 
THINK YOU'RE OFFERING SOME VERY
21:15:42  
INTERESTING CHOICES HOW TO 
CONSIDER OUR BUDGET AND I THANK 

21:15:45 YOU FOR THAT.
I'M SORRY FOR THE UNCOMFORT OF 
WHAT I'M
21:15:49  TRYING TO SAY.
I'M TRYING TO MAKE IT AS SIMPLE 
AND
21:15:52  AS OPEN AND AS DECENT AS 
POSSIBLE.
THANKS
21:15:55  FOR YOUR TIME WITH IT AND 
THANKS FOR THIS BUDGET
21:15:58  REPORT 
AND THANKS.
21:16:01 
>> Mayor Mei:   SO AT THIS TIME 
I'M GOING TO BRING IT -- I'M 

21:16:04 GOING TO CLOSE THE PUBLIC 
COMMENT PERIOD AND BRING IT BACK 
TO THE COUNCIL AND
21:16:07  THE PROPOSAL 
IS TO ACCEPT THE REPORT AND
21:16:11  
PRESENTATION AND TO INCREASE THE 
GENERAL FUND
21:16:14  BUDGET UNCERTAINTY 
RESERVE TO $10 MILLION AND WOULD 
I SAY THAT
21:16:17  IT WAS REALLY 
CRITICAL FOR US.
21:16:20 
I STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT BECAUSE 
OF THE FACT
21:16:24  THAT WOO WE HAD A 
SUBSTANTIAL
21:16:28  OR SIGNIFICANT FLUFF 
INVESTMENT IN OUR PLAQUE FOR THE
21:16:31  
GENERAL FUND UNCERTAINTY 
THREARVE WE DID NOT NEED TO
21:16:34  MAKE 
SOME OF THE CUTS THAT FELLOW 
CITIES AND OTHER
21:16:37  MUNICIPALITIES 
ACROSS THE NATION HAD TO DO SO 
AND THIS IS ALSO TO TRANSFER
21:16:41  ANY 
REMAINING GENERAL FUND 
UNRESERVED END
21:16:45 ING FUND BALANCE 
APPROXIMATELY $700
21:16:48 ,000 TO THE 
CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT FUND.
AND THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE
21:16:51  WE 
MENTIONED ABOUT PUBLIC PROJECTS 
THAT MAY HAVE BEEN PUT
21:16:54  ON HOLD 
OR HAVE PUT TO THE SIDE AT THIS 
MOMENT
21:16:59 .
21:17:02 
SO DO I HAVE A MOTION?
>> Councilmember Cox:  
21:17:05  SO 
MOVED.
>> Councilmember Jones:   SECOND
21:17:08 
SECOND.
>> Mayor Mei:   MOVED BY 

21:17:11 COUNCILMEMBER COX, SECONDED BY 
COUNCILMEMBER JONES.
ROLL CALL.
21:17:15 
>> The Clerk:   COUNCILMEMBER 
COX, AYE
21:17:19 , COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, 
AYE
21:17:22 .
COUNCILMEMBER KENG, AYE.
COUNCILMEMBER JONES,
21:17:25  AYE.
VICE MAYOR SHAO, AYE
21:17:28 .
MAYOR MEI.
AYE.

21:17:31 THE MOTION PASSES UNANIMOUSLY TO 
ACCEPT THE YEAR
21:17:33  END REPORT AND 
THE BALANCE.
I LOOK FORWARD TO THE 

21:17:37 CONVERSATION AS WE PLAN THE NEXT 
UPCOMING YEAR
21:17:41 'S BUDGETS.
THANK YOU DIRECTOR PERSSELIN FOR
21:17:44  
YOU AND YOUR TEAM FOR US TO
21:17:47  
CONTINUE OUR FINANCIAL 
RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE BUDGET.
21:17:49 
>> David Persselin:   WELCOME.
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

21:17:52 WE'VE ALREADY TAKEN CARE OF ITEM 
7B
21:17:56  WHICH IS AFFORDABLE HOUSING 
FUNDING AWARDS.
21:17:59 
I JUST WANTED TO MENTION THOSE 
ARE SOME OF THE THINGS
21:18:03  WE TALKED 
ABOUT, THE ABILITY OF NOTICE OF 
FUND
21:18:07 ING AFFORDABLE CONCERNS, 
RECORD NUMBERS
21:18:10  THAT WE BUILT IN 
THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS.
NEXT IS
21:18:13  ITEM 8A WHICH IS A 
COUNCIL REFERRAL AND THIS IS
21:18:18  A 
COUNCILMEMBER KENG'S REFERRAL 
AND SHE'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE
21:18:21  THE 
REFERRAL.
>> Councilmember Keng:   SURE, 

21:18:23 THANK YOU VERY MUCH, MADAM 
MAYOR.
IF I CAN ALSO PROVIDE A LITTLE 

21:18:26 BIT OF BACKGROUND FOR THIS 
REFERRAL.
21:18:30 
SO THE AVERAGE AMERICAN HAS $400
21:18:33  
IN EMERGENCY SAVINGS.
BEFORE THE PANDEMIC
21:18:36 , FREMONT 
UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT ALREADY
21:18:39  
HAD 300 STUDENTS WHO DID NOT 
HAVE STABLE HOUSING.
21:18:42 
WE ALSO HAVE COLLEGE STUDENTS 
LIVING IN THEIR CARS.

21:18:45 THE PANDEMIC HAS CAUSED MANY 
FAMILIES TO
21:18:48  STRUGGLE IN THEIR 
HEALTH AND EMPLOYMENT.
SINCE THE
21:18:51  PANDEMIC, WE ARE 
SEEING LONG LINES AT
21:18:55  FOOD 
DRIVES, MORE TENTS POPPING UP
21:18:58  AT 
DIFFERENT SPOTS THIS OUR CITY 
AND MORE INDIVIDUALS LIVING IN
21:19:01  
THEIR CARS AND RVS, AS WE KNOW 
HOW CHALLENGE
21:19:04 ING IT WOULD BE TO 
HELP PEOPLE ONCE
21:19:08  THEY LOST THEIR 
HOUSING, IT IS CRITICAL TO
21:19:11  HAVE 
PROGRAMS IN PLACE TO HELP THESE 
INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES
21:19:14 , MOST 
AT RISK BEFORE THEY FALL INTO 
HOME
21:19:18 LESSNESS.
AND EARLIER WE SEE THAT WE HAVE
21:19:21  
THE SPENDING FOR RENTAL 
ASSISTANCE BUT OFTEN PEOPLE
21:19:24  HAVE 
TO CHOOSE BETWEEN PAYING RENT OR
21:19:27  
PAYING FOOD OR PAYING FOR HEALTH 
CARE BECAUSE MANY
21:19:30  FAMILIES OF 
THESE LOW INCOME FAMILIES DO NOT 
HAVE
21:19:34  HEALTH CARE IN PLACE.
I DO WANT TO CLARIFY
21:19:37  THAT THIS 
UPI PILOT PROGRAM AIMS TO AID
21:19:42  
ALL OF THE LOWER, VERY
21:19:45  LOW 
INCOME AND AT RISK INDIVIDUALS 
AND FAMILIES.

21:19:48 NOT ONLY THE FOSTER YOUTH OF THE 
$
21:19:51 35 MILLION FUNDING IS ONE OF 
THE FUNDING SOURCES FOR THIS
21:19:54  
PILOT PROGRAM.
AND IF WE ARE ABLE TO
21:19:57  GET 
FUNDING FROM THE FEDERAL 
AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN,
21:20:01  THEN WE 
WOULD BE -- WOULD HAVE
21:20:04  THE 
FUNDING TO HELP MORE FAMILIES AT 
RISK.

21:20:07 THANK YOU.
21:20:10 
AND AT THIS TIME,
21:20:16  MADAM MAYOR, 
MAYBE SEE IF THERE ARE
21:20:19  -- YES, 
OKAY, YOU CAN PROCEED, THANK 
YOU.

21:20:22 >> Mayor Mei:   SURE.
ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS OR 
COMMENTS?

21:20:25 WE'LL BEGIN WITH COUNCILMEMBER 
JONES
21:20:28 .
>> Councilmember Jones:   THANK 
YOU, MADAM MAYOR.
21:20:31 
SO COUNCILMEMBER KENG, THANK YOU 
FOR CLARIFYING THAT
21:20:34  THIS IS NOT 
JUST STRICTLY FOR THE TWO 
CATEGORIES THAT YOU
21:20:36  HAD 
INITIALLY LISTED IN THE 
REFERRAL.

21:20:39 OUT OF CURIOSITY, YOU KNOW,
21:20:42  YOU 
MENTIONED THERE ARE 300 STUDENTS 
IN FUSD THAT ARE CURRENTLY
21:20:46  
UNHOUSED OR HOUSING IN SECURE.
HAS
21:20:49  FUSD APPLIED FOR ANY OF 
THESE FUNDS, OR DO THEY HAVE
21:20:52  THE 
ABILITY TO APPLY FOR THESE 
FUNDS?

21:20:55 >> Councilmember Keng:   YEAH, 
SO OI HAD THAT DATA IN
21:20:58  JUST 
BECAUSE THESE ARE FAMILIES THAT 
ARE IN OUR
21:21:01  COMMUNITIES.
SO THEY ARE STUDENTS, WE
21:21:05  HAVE 
BEEN HELPING THEM EACH YEAR AT 
CHRISTMASTIME, WE WOULD
21:21:09  GET THEM 
CHRISTMAS PRESENTS, BUT, YOU 
KNOW, THESE ARE THE
21:21:12  FAMILIES 
THAT ARE MOST AT RISK.
AND AWE
21:21:15  WE DO HAVE
21:21:19  SOME OF THIS 
RENTAL ASSISTANCE BUT
21:21:22  THEY ARE 
NOT GETTING BECAUSE THEY ARE 
MAYBE LIVING
21:21:25  WITH RELATIVES 
RIGHT BUT THEY ARE STILL 
CONSIDERED NOT HAVING
21:21:28  A 
PERMANENT ADDRESS.
SO WE I BELIEVE THAT
21:21:31  WE REALLY 
NEED TO HELP THESE
21:21:35  FAMILIES MOST 
AT RISK AND TO PROVIDE FUNDING 
NOT
21:21:38  JUST FOR RENTAL BUT ALSO FOR 
OTHER LIVING COSTS
21:21:42 .
>> Councilmember Jones:   OKAY 
AND FOR
21:21:46  MS.
21:21:50  MARGOLIS, WOULD THIS 
PROVIDE
21:21:53  FOR THIS TYPE EVER 
FUNDING, IS IT SOMETHING THAT WE
21:21:56  
CAN USE IT FOR OR DOES IT HAVE 
NARROW
21:22:01 ER PARAMETERS?
>> Ms. Margolis:   I'M
21:22:04  NOT 
FAMILIAR ENOUGH WITH THE 
AMERICAN RESCUE
21:22:08  PLAN TO PROVIDE 
THAT ANSWER.
MAYBE SUZANNE OR
21:22:11  BILL CAN.
>> Mayor Mei:   SUZANNE
21:22:15 ?
DIRECTOR
21:22:23  SHENFIL ARE YOU ON THE 
LINE?
21:22:25 
>> Suzanne Shenfil:   SORRY, 
COULDN'T UNMUTE.

21:22:28 WE ARE CERTAINLY WILLING
21:22:32  TO 
RESEARCH WHETHER IT WOULD BE AN 
ALLOWABLE USE
21:22:35 .
>> Councilmember Jones:   OKAY.
THE LAST THING
21:22:39  TO CLARIFY IS THE 
$35 MILLION IS THE
21:22:42  TOTAL AMOUNT 
AVAILABLE STATEWIDE CORRECT?
>> Suzanne Shenfil:   THAT IS
21:22:45  
OUR UNDERSTANDING, AB 153 AND 
WE'VE
21:22:48  LOOKED AT THE LEGISLATION.
IT SEEMS TO BE
21:22:52  PRIMARILY 
TARGETED FOR FOSTER YOUTH.
21:22:55 
BUT THERE MAY BE SOME OTHER 
CAVEATS THAT WE
21:23:00  HAVEN'T LOOKED 
AT
21:23:03  YET.
>> Councilmember Jones:   OKAY, 
THANK YOU.
21:23:06 
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.
COUNCILMEMBER SHAO
21:23:09  OR VICE MAYOR 
SHAO.
THANK YOU.

21:23:12 >> Councilmember Shao:   THANK 
YOU.
SO BASED ON MY EXPERIENCE FOR 

21:23:16 FUSD TO REALLY CALCULATE HOW 
MANY
21:23:20  STUDENTS ARE NOT HAVING THE
21:23:23  
PERMANENT ADDRESSES,
21:23:26  THE 
VERIFICATION PROCESS IS VERY 
VAGUE.

21:23:29 IT'S BASICALLY THE STUDENTS JUST 
CLAIM.
21:23:32 
AND ALSO, IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT
21:23:35  
THEY ARE HOMELESS OR ABOUT TO BE 
HOMELESS.
21:23:38 
IT'S JUST THAT THEY ARE LIVING 
WITH RELATIVES
21:23:42 .
SO MY UNDERSTANDING IS
21:23:46  THAT THAT 
NUMBER WAS
21:23:50  ACTUALLY BEFORE 
PANDEMIC.
21:23:53 
AND TYPICALLY, WHEN WE TRY TO 
HELP THE
21:23:56  FAMILY FROM THE CITY 
LEVEL,
21:24:00  MAYBE WE ARE ADDRESSING 
THE PARENTS, NOT THE STUDENTS
21:24:03 .
BECAUSE AFTER ALL, YOU KNOW 
THOSE
21:24:06  STUDENTS, THEY ARE UNDER
21:24:09  
THE GUARDIANSHIP
21:24:13  OF SOME ADULTS.
21:24:18 
SO I JUST WANT TO CONFIRM
21:24:22 , YOUR 
UBI IS FOR MINORS
21:24:25  ONLY OR
21:24:28  YOU'RE 
TARGETING THE FAMILIES INSTEAD 
OF
21:24:31  THE MILES AN HOUR?
>> Councilmember Keng:   YES, 
SURE, THANK YOU FOR THE
21:24:34  
QUESTION.
SO ACTUALLY SOME OF THESE UBI 

21:24:38 PILOT PROGRAMS FOR EXAMPLE IN 
LOS ANGELES, THEY JUST PASSED 
ONE LAST WEEK
21:24:41  FOR -- THESE ARE
21:24:44  
AS FAMILY AS UNITS.
SO WE CAN STUDY MORE OF HOW
21:24:47  WE 
WANT TO IMPLEMENT ONCE WE HAVE 
FUNDING L
21:24:50 .
BECAUSE SO FOR EXAMPLE, FOR LOS 
ANGELES
21:24:54  THEIR FAMILY PROGRAM IS 
FOR
21:24:57  FAMILIES OF CERTAIN -- THEY 
WOULD HAVE A GUIDELINE
21:25:00  OF MAYBE 
25% OF THE POVERTY LINE INCOME
21:25:03 .
AND WITH A MINOR CHILD.
SO
21:25:07  THAT CONSIDERED AS A FAMILY 
UNIT.
AND IN OAKLAND AS WELL
21:25:10 , THEY 
HAVE A RESILIENT
21:25:15  FAMILIES UBI 
PILOT PROGRAM THEY JUST STARTED 
A COUPLE
21:25:18  MONTHS AGO, AIMING FOR 
THESE LOWER INCOME FAMILIES
21:25:21 .
YEAH
21:25:25 .
>> Councilmember Shao:   MY NEXT 
QUESTION WOULD BE HOW MANY
21:25:28  OF 
THOSE FAMILIES THAT YOU
21:25:31  TRY TO 
TARGET ARE ALREADY UNDER THE 
COUNTY OR STATE WELFARE
21:25:35  
PROGRAMS?
YOU KNOW, WE OFTEN HEARD THIS
21:25:38  
UBI AND MAYBE UBI HERE IS
21:25:41  
MISUSED TERM.
BECAUSE A, IT
21:25:44  IMPLIES PERMANENT.
21:25:47 
AND COOKIE CUTTER OVER
21:25:50  THE BOARD 
UNIFORM AMOUNT OF MONEY.
ACTUALLY EACH
21:25:54  FAMILY HAS 
DIFFERENT SIZES.
EACH FAMILY
21:25:57  HAS DIFFERENT NEEDS.
AND THE DEGREE
21:26:00  OF POVERTY IS 
DIFFERENT.
21:26:05 
SO I DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOUR UBI
21:26:08  
WOULD IMPLY A UNIFORM AMOUNT 
ACROSS THE
21:26:11  BOARD, FOR THOSE 
FAMILIES, OR IT WOULD BE
21:26:15  LIKE 
PER PERSON.
ARE AND
21:26:18 AND
21:26:21  SECONDLY, THE UBI WOULD 
IMPLY ONGOING
21:26:24  PROGRAM.
AND ARE YOU AWARE THAT THERE'S 
ANY FUNDING SOURCES
21:26:28  THAT WOULD 
PROVIDE ON
21:26:31 GOING FUNDING FOR SUCH 
PROGRAM WHICH
21:26:34  IS NOT TEMPORARY?
21:26:36 
>> Councilmember Keng:   SURE, 
THANK YOU.

21:26:39 YEAH, AS A PILOT PROGRAM THIS IS 
OF COURSE NOT A
21:26:42  PERMANENT 
PROGRAM AND OF COURSE IT ALL 
DEPENDS ON THE FUNDING
21:26:46 , HOW MUCH 
FUNDING WE'RE ABLE TO GET.
AND SO WE
21:26:49  -- FOR EXAMPLE, IN 
L.A., SO YOUR
21:26:52  QUESTION OF HOW 
LONG AND ALSO
21:26:56 , YOU KNOW, AS AN 
INDIVIDUAL OR FAMILY UNIT.
SO EARLIER
21:26:59 , I MENTIONED THAT IN 
LOS ANGELES,
21:27:03  THEY ISSUE -- THEY 
ALLOW FAMILY TO APPLY
21:27:07  AS A 
FAMILY UNIT, WITH AT LEAST
21:27:10  ONE 
MINOR CHILD.
AND THE FUNDING
21:27:13 , THE 
QUALIFICATION
21:27:17  WOULD BE 
PERCENTAGE OF THE FEDERAL 
POVERTY GUIDELINE
21:27:20  ACCORDING TO 
FAMILY SIZE.
AND THEN IF
21:27:23  ALL THE FAMILY IS 
THE SAME, WHETHER IT'S $
21:27:26 500 A 
MONTH AND DEPENDING ON HOW MUCH 
FUNDING WE
21:27:29  HAVE, THEN IT COULD 
BE ON A ONE-YEAR OR
21:27:32  TWO-YEAR 
PILOT PROGRAM.
SO THAT'S WHAT I'M PROPOSING
21:27:35 .
>> Councilmember Shao:   YES, MY 
THIRD QUESTION WOULD BE 

21:27:38 REGARDING THIS TERM PILOT 
PROGRAM.
A
21:27:41  PILOT PROGRAM IMPLIES THAT 
YOU'RE GOING TO EXPAND THAT
21:27:44  
PROGRAM LATER.
SO FOR THAT PART
21:27:48 , DO YOU HAVE 
ANY FUNDING SOURCES
21:27:51  N
21:27:54  FOR THE
21:27:58  
EXPANSION?
IF FOR EXAMPLE YOUR PILOT
21:28:01  
PROGRAM REALLY SUCCEEDS?
>> Councilmember Keng:  
21:28:04  SURE, 
WE HOPE TO HAVE SOME FUNDING
21:28:08 , IF 
ANY OF THESE FAMILIES HAVE
21:28:10  
ALREADY BEEN COVERED WITH 
CURRENT WELFARE PROGRAM OR 

21:28:13 ANYTHING.
THE IF THESE FAMILIES HAVE BEEN 
COVERED OR THESE
21:28:16  INDIVIDUALS 
HAVE BEEN COVERED ALREADY THEN 
WE WOULDN'T BE
21:28:19  SEEING TENTS 
POPPING UP.
YESTERDAY I WAS DRIVING BY
21:28:23  NILES 
CANYON AND THESE ARE NEW TENTS 
THAT I DID NOT SEE A
21:28:26  COUPLE OF 
MONTHS AGO.
AND WE HAD PEOPLE LIVING IN
21:28:30  
THEIR RVs IN THEIR CARS,
21:28:33  LIKE 
BECAUSE YOU KNOW HOUSING AND 
COST OF
21:28:36  LIVING HAS RISEN SO 
MUCH, A LOT OF
21:28:40  CAN HAVE LOST
21:28:43  THEIR 
EMPLOYMENT.
IF THEY HAD RESOURCES THEY
21:28:45  
WOULDN'T BE ON THE STREET, 
RIGHT?

21:28:48 I THINK THE KEY IS, THE POINT OF 
HAVING THIS PROGRAM IS TO
21:28:51  I 
THINK IT IS MUCH MORE EFFICIENT 
AND
21:28:54  EFFECTIVE TO HELP PEOPLE 
BEFORE THEY FALL
21:28:58  INTO 
HOMELESSNESS.
BECAUSE ONCE THEY -- IF YOU
21:29:01  HELP -- IF YOU FOR EXAMPLE GIVE 
THIS
21:29:04  FAMILY 500 OR $1 YOU,000 A
21:29:07  
MONTH RIGHT NOW BEFORE THEY LOSS 
THEIR HOUSING THAT
21:29:10  WOULD PREVENT 
THEM TO FALL INTO HOMELESSNESS.

21:29:13 BUT ONCE THEY LOSE THEIR HOUSING
21:29:16 
HOUSING, YOU KNOW, YOU'RE 
SPENDING $5,000 PER PERSON AND 

21:29:19 STILL NOT BE ABLE TO GET THEM 
INTO A PERMANENT HOME.
SO I
21:29:22  THINK, YOU KNOW, A LOT OF 
TIMES GOVERNMENT, A LOT OF TIMES 
PEOPLE
21:29:26  FEEL LIKE OH, THE 
GOVERNMENT IS SPENDING MILLIONS 
AND MILLIONS
21:29:29  OF DOLLARS, ON 
PROGRAMS
21:29:34  AND, YOU KNOW, 
THOUSANDS, TENS OF THOUSANDS ON 
EACH INDIVIDUAL
21:29:38 .
AND THEY'RE SEEING STILL MORE 
HOMELESS
21:29:41 NESS RISING AND PEOPLE 
ARE LOSING THEIR
21:29:44  TRUST IN THE 
GOVERNMENT THAT'S BECAUSE WE ARE 
JUST PATCHING UP
21:29:47  HOLES BUT WE'RE 
NOT PREVENTING THE PROBLEM FROM 
GROWING
21:29:50 .
SO I THINK THE MORE EFFECTIVE
21:29:53  
AND EFFICIENT WAY
21:29:57  BECAUSE 
PREVENTION IS BETTER THAN 
TREATMENT.

21:30:00 DO I HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF 
MEDICAL BACKGROUND.
I THINK PEOPLE IN THE
21:30:03  MEDICAL 
FIELD WOULD AGREE THAT 
PREVENTION IS BETTER THAN 

21:30:05 TREATMENT.
SO HENCE THE INTRODUCTION OF 
THIS PILOT PROGRAM.

21:30:11 THANK YOU.
>> Councilmember Shao:   I HAVE 
MORE QUESTIONS BUT I WOULD YIELD
21:30:14  
MY TIME TO OTHER COUNCILMEMBERS 
FIRST
21:30:18 .
>> Mayor Mei:   CLS
21:30:22 COUNCILMEMBER 
SALWAN, YOUR
21:30:25  CLARIFYING IMEPS.
>> Councilmember Salwan:   
COUNCILMEMBER KENG RIGHT NOW I
21:30:28  
THINK YOUR ASK IS JUST FOR THE 
STAFF
21:30:31  TO RESEARCH THIS ISSUE.
>> Councilmember Keng:   RIGHT.
21:30:34 
>> Councilmember Salwan:   AND 
APPLY FOR A GRANT.

21:30:37 >> Councilmember Keng:   YES.
>> Councilmember Salwan:   AND 
HOPEFULLY STAFF CAN ANSWER WHAT
21:30:40  
THE ONGOING COMMITMENTS ARE IF 
WE GET THE GRANT,
21:30:43  WHAT THE 
PARAMETERS ARE.
THERE IS A LARGER U
21:30:46 BI DISCUSSION 
BUT THAT IS NOT YOUR SPECIFIC
21:30:49  
ASK AT THIS POINT IS THAT 
CORRECT?

21:30:52 >> Councilmember Keng:   THANK 
YOU COUNCILMEMBER.
FIRST WE HAVE TO SEE IF WE HAVE 

21:30:56 THE FUNDING.
I BELIEVE THE AMERICAN RESCUE 
PLAN
21:30:59  DOES COVER FOR FAMILIES WHO 
ARE AT
21:31:02  RISK, WHO ARE
21:31:06  IN DIRE 
NEED OF HELP.
SO WHETHER
21:31:11  THEY ARE AFFECTED BY 
THE PANDEMIC LOSING LOVED ONES
21:31:14 , 
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE THAT HAD 
CONTRACTED COVID,
21:31:17  MANY OF THEM 
HAVE SOME PERMANENT HEALTH 
ISSUES THAT THEY ARE
21:31:21  STILL T 
DEALING WITH SO THEY MAY NOT
21:31:24  BE 
ABLE TO GET BACK TO WORK RIGHT 
AWAY OR PEOPLE
21:31:28 , THEY HAVE TO 
TAKE CARE OF THEIR FAMILY 
MEMBERS.

21:31:31 SO THOSE ARE NOT BEING ACCOUNTED 
FOR AND PLUS
21:31:34  PEOPLE THAT, YOU 
KNOW, IF THEIR
21:31:37  WORKPLACE, THEIR 
RETAIL
21:31:40  SHOPS CLOSE IT IS NOT 
THAT EASY TO JUST OH I WILL 
APPLY
21:31:43  FOR A DIFFERENT JOB
21:31:46 .
>> Councilmember Salwan:   I'M 
OKAY
21:31:49  WITH STAFF GOING AHEAD AND 
APPLYING FOR THESE
21:31:53  GRANTS.
>> Councilmember Keng:   THANK 
YOU
21:31:56 .
>> Mayor Mei:   COUNCILMEMBER 
COX FOR CLARIFYING QUESTIONS OR 

21:32:00 COMMENTS.
>> Councilmember Cox:   YES.
I WOULD
21:32:04  PROBABLY WHEN YOU'RE 
COMPARING, I APPRECIATE
21:32:08  WHAT 
COUNCILMEMBER KENG IS PRESENT
21:32:11 
PRESENTING.
WHEN WE COMPARE MOUNTAIN VIEW TO
21:32:14  
OAKLAND, THEY HAVE A MUCH HIGHER
21:32:17  
POVERTY RATE BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, 
FOR ONE, MOUNTAIN VIEW
21:32:21 'S AVERAGE 
HOUSING PRICE IS $1.4
21:32:24  MILLION 
COMPARED TO FREMONT'S AT 
$900,000
21:32:27  BASED ON THE CENSUS, 
RIGHT, DATA
21:32:30 .
AND WE'RE AT ABOUT ONE
21:32:34 , LESS 
THAN 2% FOR POVERTY.
AND ONE
21:32:37  OF THE THINGS JUST TO 
MAKE SURE WE'RE CLEAR ON IS
21:32:40  
THAT, YOU KNOW, AS YOU TALK 
ABOUT STUDENTS IN THE PROGRAM,
21:32:43  
AND THERE ARE THOSE THAT
21:32:48  WERE 
ABLE TO PROVIDE THROUGH SCHOOLS 
THE SUBSIDIZE
21:32:51 ED FOOD PROGRAM 
RIGHT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY GET 
MEALS WHEN
21:32:54  THEY'RE AT SCHOOL 
THERE.
I KNOW FROM SERVING
21:32:57  ON OHLONE 
COLLEGE FOR THE PAST 12 YEARS
21:33:00  
I'VE ONLY KNOWN OF CASES OF LESS 
THAN GO OR THREE
21:33:04  TWO OR THREE STUDENTS THAT 
WERE
21:33:07  UNSHELTERED BUT THE SCHOOL 
WAS ABLE TO DEAL WITH
21:33:11  THAT ON A 
ONE-OFF UNIQUE BASIS FOR EACH
21:33:13  
ONE OF THOSE STUDENTS IN THAT 
CASE.

21:33:16 I KNOW THAT THIS IS HAD THE 
PRELIMINARY,
21:33:24  PRELIMINARY, 
WE WOULD BE INVESTIGATING WHAT 
THE GRANTS ARE.

21:33:27 THE KEY PART IS FINDING GRANTS 
THAT ARE ABLE
21:33:30  TO HELP IN THIS 
AREA BUT ALSO UNDERSTAND
21:33:34 ING IS 
IT JUST MORE ABOUT SHELTER
21:33:38 ?
COUNCILWOMAN KENG, THAT
21:33:41  YOU'RE 
CONCERNED ABOUT OR IS IT THE 
BASIC NEEDS BESIDES SHELTER
21:33:44  AND 
FOOD?
BECAUSE YOU KNOW THERE'S BEEN 

21:33:48 THIS ONGOING MONEYS THAT HAVE 
BEEN
21:33:51  COMING FROM THE FEDERAL 
GOVERNMENT THAT HAVE BEEN GIVEN 
TO
21:33:54  FAMILIES THAT ARE AT CERTAIN 
LEVELS OF INCOME THAT ARE LIKE
21:33:57  
$75,000 OR SOMETHING OR LESS 
THAT THEY HAVE BEEN RECEIVING
21:34:01  
CHECKS FROM THE FEDERAL 
GOVERNMENT.

21:34:04 PLUS, YOU KNOW, PER
21:34:09  STUDENT THAT 
WOULD BE GIVING MONEY FOR THOSE 
THAT ARE
21:34:12  UNDER THE AGE OF 18.
21:34:15 
SO, YOU KNOW, JUST TRYING TO 
UNDERSTAND WHERE
21:34:18  IS THE ACTUAL 
PURPOSE, AND
21:34:22  NOT, YOU KNOW, 
THAT'S ONE THING.
AND THEN YOU'RE NOT ASKING
21:34:25  TO 
IMPLEMENT THE UNIVERSAL BASIC
21:34:29  
INCOME?
THAT'S WHERE I'M
21:34:32  KIND OF A 
LITTLE FUZZY IN UNDERSTANDING 
THE REFERRAL.
21:34:35 
IS IT TWOFOLD, THREEFOLD OR JUST 
SAYING WHAT IS
21:34:39  YOUR OBJECTIVE OF 
BRINGING THIS FORWARD?
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO SOLVE
21:34:41 ?
>> Councilmember Keng:   THANK 
YOU SO MUCH.

21:34:44 YEAH SO GREAT QUESTION.
SO BASICALLY WE'RE TRYING
21:34:47  TO 
LIFT THE FAMILIES IN POVERTY 
AND, YOU KNOW,
21:34:50  WE SAW EARLIER 
ALREADY 80%
21:34:53  OF THE RENTAL 
ASSISTANCE HAVE BEEN APPLIED 
FOR.

21:34:56 BUT, YOU KNOW, THERE ARE 
FAMILIES STILL
21:34:59  BASICALLY 
CALIFORNIA EVEN FREMONT HAS LIKE 
YOU
21:35:02  MENTIONED WE HAVE 2% OF OUR 
RESIDENTS IN
21:35:06  POVERTY.
BUT
21:35:09 , YOU KNOW, TIMES THAT BY
21:35:12  OUR 
POPULATION, WE SHOULD DO A QUICK
21:35:15  
MATH HERE, IT'S ABOUT
21:35:19  ALMOST --
>> Councilmember Cox:  
21:35:22  2,000.
>> Councilmember Keng:   SO IT'S 
LIKE
21:35:26  ABOUT FIVE -- YES,
21:35:29  ACTUALLY 
5,000 PEOPLE OR MORE.
SO I
21:35:32  WOULD SAY THAT, YOU KNOW, 
WE, I THINK
21:35:36  IT'S A FACT THAT, 
YOU KNOW, WE ARE SEEING MORE AND 
MORE
21:35:39  TENTS, YOU KNOW, EITHER 
IT'S BEHIND THE FREMONT LIBRARY
21:35:42 , 
RIGHT, OR IN THE NILES AREA,
21:35:46  OR 
UNDER, YOU KNOW, ALL THE 
DIFFERENT HIGHWAY PASSES
21:35:49 .
AND THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE NOT 
GETTING
21:35:52  THE HELP THAT THEY NEED.
21:35:57 
SO WE NEED TO HAVE MORE OF THESE 
PROGRAMS, NOT JUST FOR RENTAL
21:36:00  
BUT FOR HELP, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE 
ARE HAVING TO CHOOSE
21:36:03  BETWEEN 
PAYING FOR FOOD OR PAYING FOR 
RENT.

21:36:06 AND PAYING FOR
21:36:09  HEALTH CARE, DRUG 
PRICES.
SO I THINK THE MORE
21:36:12  OF THESE 
KIND OF PREVENTION, I
21:36:15  THINK THAT 
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WHETHER
21:36:19  IT 
IS A -- LIKE WAS MENTIONED
21:36:23  IN 
THE -- IN THE ONE OF THE
21:36:26  
APPROVED FUNDING BY THE 
GOVERNOR, THE $35 MILLION,
21:36:29  IT IS 
A UBI PROGRAM
21:36:33  THAT ACTUALLY THE 
COUNTY OF SANTA CLARA LAST YEAR 
THEY
21:36:36  HAD ALREADY APPROVED 
FUNDING, THEY DO
21:36:39  CALL IT A UBI 
PROGRAM FOR FOSTER
21:36:44  YOUTH AT 
TRANSITION AGE.
AND I THINK
21:36:47  IN ALAMEDA WE DON'T 
HAVE THAT PROGRAM.
BUT, YOU KNOW,
21:36:50  IT'S THE IDEA IS 
TO PROVIDE THE PEOPLE AND THE 
INDIVIDUALS
21:36:53  AND FAMILIES MOST AT
21:36:57  
RISK A CUSHION SO THAT
21:37:00  ONCE THEY -- WHETHER IT'S A LOSS OF 
EMPLOYMENT OR HAVING A
21:37:04  HEALTH 
CRISIS, OR HAVING A
21:37:07  FAMILY 
MEMBER WITH CRISIS
21:37:10 , THEY WON'T 
HAVE TO CHOOSE PAYING THEIR RENT 
OR
21:37:13  PAYING FOR FOOD.
21:37:17 
SO IF MOST FAMILIES EVEN YOU OR 
I, IF
21:37:20  WE LOSE OUR JOB WE DON'T 
HAVE MONTHS TO LAST TO PAY FOR
21:37:25  
OUR MORTGAGE, RIGHT?
SO PRETTY MUCH THE SAME
21:37:28  FOR 
THESE OTHER FAMILIES.
>> Councilmember Cox:   RIGHT.
21:37:31 
AND ALSO I THINK WE'RE GETTING A 
LITTLE MIXED WITH THE SAFE
21:37:34  
PARKING PROGRAM
21:37:37  AND WHEN YOU'RE 
SAYING THAT, YOU KNOW, THERE ARE 
CARS ON THE SIDE
21:37:40  OF THE ROAD AS 
WELL.
AND MAYBE THAT'S ANOTHER PART TO 

21:37:44 GET AN UPDATE ON THE SAFE 
PARKING PROGRAM ON
21:37:47  HOW THINGS 
ARE GOING AND GET A STATUS ON
21:37:50  
THAT ASPECT AS WELL
21:37:53 .
I'VE ALSO AS WE ALL LIVE
21:37:57  IN 
FREMONT THAT EVEN THOUGH WE MAY 
TRY TO
21:38:00  REACH AND HELP OTHERS, IN 
THIS
21:38:03  SCENARIO SOME WE CAN HELP,
21:38:06  
AND I THINK FROM THE SUCCESS OF 
THE NAVIGATION
21:38:10  CENTER WE'VE HAD 
THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO 
MOVE
21:38:14  FORWARD, AND MOVE FORWARD 
IN THEIR
21:38:17  LIVES AND OTHERS, IT'S 
BEEN RATHER DIFFICULT AND
21:38:20  
CHALLENGING.
AND
21:38:24  SO I HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING
21:38:25 
SAYING.
IT'S JUST TRYING TO MAKE SURE 

21:38:29 THAT WE UNDERSTAND GOING 
FORWARD, IT IS MORE OF 
EXPLORATORY OF
21:38:32  THE GRANTS FIRST 
THAN COMING
21:38:35  BACK AND THEN HAVING 
IT REPORTED BACK OUT ON
21:38:38  WHAT IS 
FOUND AND WHAT ATO DO TO
21:38:41  HELP.
I THINK ALSO, OUR FINANCE AND
21:38:44  
WITH THE HELP OF SUZANNE AND 
OTHERS ON THE CITY
21:38:48  STAFF THAT 
THEY HAVE PROVIDED, YOU KNOW, 
THERE IS MONEY
21:38:51  THAT HAS 
INCREASED THE FUNDS BUT OF 
COURSE FROM
21:38:54  WHAT WE'VE DISCUSSED 
IT'S MORE BECAUSE OF REPLACING
21:38:58  
THE MONEY BACK THAT WAS ALREADY 
SPENT AND NOW GOING FORWARD
21:39:01  WE 
HAVE TO ALSO SEE HOW THOSE 
THINGS ARE HAPPENING
21:39:04  THERE.
BUT I'M
21:39:07  WILLING TO LOOK AT IT AS 
EXPLORATORY FOR
21:39:10  GRANTS, BUT 
UNDERSTANDING THE TERMS
21:39:13  OF THE 
GRANTS, UNDERSTANDING THE 
CONDITIONS AND THINGS LIKE
21:39:17  THAT 
BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE
21:39:20  CAN BE -- 
WE GOT TO DO A LITTLE BIT OF 
INVESTIGATE
21:39:23 ING.
AND THEN ALSO WHO ARE WE GOING 
TO
21:39:26  HAVE TO LOOK FOR THE AMERICAN 
RESCUE PLAN TO
21:39:29  UNDERSTAND SOME 
OF THE THINGS THAT WOULD BE 
INTERPRETED COMING BACK INTO
21:39:34  THE 
SPECIFIC BUDGET FOR CITY OF 
FREMONT?
21:39:37 
AND THAT'S ANOTHER PIECE THAT IS 
KIND EVER MISSING THERE
21:39:41 .
I'VE DONE SOME RESEARCH ON
21:39:45  THE 
UNIVERSAL BASIC INCOME AND IT
21:39:48  
HAS MIXED REVIEWS FOR IT.
SOME ARE
21:39:51  FOR, SOME ARE AGAINST 
AND IT IS LOOKING
21:39:54  OF A FORM OF A 
STEADY $1,000 FOR EXAMPLE
21:39:57  MONEY 
COMING IN FOR A WHILE.
BUT IT DEPENDS ON HOW
21:40:01  EACH 
BUDGET, EVERYBODY IS SET UP TO
21:40:04  
IMPLEMENT SOMETHING LIKE THAT
21:40:12 .
SO I WOULD BE WILLING TO JUST
21:40:14  
EXPLORE IT AND HAVE STAFF REPORT 
BACK.

21:40:17 >> Mayor Mei:   SEEING THAT, I 
SEE
21:40:20  OUR CITY MANAGER HAS HER 
HAND RAISED.
I
21:40:24  WOULD DEFER TO HER.
THIS WOULD INCUR
21:40:27  STAFF TIME AND 
RESOURCES AND WHETHER OR NOT 
THIS IS SOMETHING WE HAVE BUILT
21:40:30  
IN HAVING BEEN INVOLVED WITH THE 
SCHOOL DISTRICT IN A PRIOR LIFE 

21:40:33 I KNOW THAT IF YOU WERE TO 
DISPOWK OF FOCUS ON
21:40:36  SPECIFICALLY 
ON HOW STUDENTS, WE DON'T REALLY 
HAVE THAT TYPE OF
21:40:39  RESOURCE.
EVEN AS A SCHOOLING DISTRICT IT 
WAS VERY HARD TO
21:40:43  HAVE RESIDENCY 
V
21:40:46  
VERIFICATION.
SO I'D LIKE OUR CITY MANAGER TO 

21:40:50 COMMENT ON SOME OF THE THINGS 
SHE'S HEARD THIS EVENING.
>> Karena Shackelford:  
21:40:53  THANK 
YOU, MADAM MAYOR.
I WANTED TO REFLECT ON THE
21:40:56  
ADMINISTRATIVE PERSPECTIVE WHICH 
COUNCILMEMBER COX HAS ALREADY 

21:40:59 ALLUDED TO.
SO THE REFERRAL IS SUGGESTING 
THAT STAFF
21:41:03  RESEARCH AND APPLY 
FOR THE GRANTS
21:41:06 .
AND I JUST WANT TO OFFER THAT 
BEFORE WE ACTUALLY
21:41:09  APPLY FOR ANY 
GRANTS, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES
21:41:13 , 
WE TRY AND
21:41:16  UNDERSTAND WHAT
21:41:19  THE 
IMPLICATIONS OF EACH OF THE 
GRANTS ARE.

21:41:22 FOR EXAMPLE, ARE THERE MATCHING 
FUNDS INVOLVED?
DO WE NEED TO
21:41:25  HIRE SPECIFIC 
STAFF TO
21:41:28  ADMINISTER THE PROGRAMS 
AND ALL OF THAT
21:41:31 .
SO I THINK AND I'M GOING TO 
SPEAK ON BEHALF OF
21:41:34  SUZANNE 
SHEFNL, SHE
21:41:38  
SHENFIL, SHE
21:41:43  CAN CORRECT ME IF 
I'M WRONG.
I'M SURE THAT STAFF WOULD BE
21:41:46  
HAPPY TO RESEARCH THESE GRANT 
OPPORTUNITIES BUT I WANT TO
21:41:49  JUST 
OFFER THAT AS PERHAPS SOMEONE IS 
MAKING A MOTION
21:41:52  TO RESEARCH AND 
APPLY, APPLYING FOR THE GRANTS 
MAY NOT BE
21:41:56  THE RIGHT THING TO DO 
IMMEDIATELY
21:42:00 .
IT'S VERY LIKELY IN OUR BEST
21:42:03  
INTEREST DO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S 
ALL
21:42:06  ENTAILED WITH THE GRANTS 
BEFORE WE
21:42:09  ACTUALLY SUBMIT AN 
APPLICATION.
BECAUSE THE LAST
21:42:12  THING I'D WANT 
TO HAPPEN FOR SUS
21:42:15  THAT WE ARE 
SUCCESSFULLY AWARDED A GRANT 
THAT WE
21:42:18  CAN'T SUCCESSFULLY 
EXECUTE.
SO YES, THANK YOU
21:42:22  FOR ALLOWING 
ME TO INTERJECT THAT AND I'LL 
TURN IT BACK OVER
21:42:25  TO YOU ALL.
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.
NEXT
21:42:28  FOR COMMENTS WOULD BE 
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN
21:42:32 .
>> Councilmember Kassan:   THANK 
YOU.

21:42:35 I WAS REALLY HAPPY TO SEE THIS 
ON THE AGENDA.
I'VE
21:42:38  BEEN SOMEWHAT STUDYING 
UNIVERSAL BASIC INCOME FOR MANY 
YEARS
21:42:41  AND I DO THINK IT'S THE 
DIRECTION THAT WE'LL PROBABLY BE
21:42:44  
GOING AS A -- GLOBALLY IT WILL 
BECOME
21:42:47  MORE AND MORE NECESSARY 
GIVEN WHAT'S HAPPENING IN OUR
21:42:50  
GLOBAL ECONOMY.
AND IT'S BEEN SUPPORTED
21:42:53  BY A 
VERY BROAD CROSS SECTION
21:42:57  OF 
POLITICIANS, COMPANIES, 
PROGRESSIVE
21:43:00  ACTIVISTS, 
CONSERVATIVES, SO I
21:43:03  WAS REALLY 
HAPPY TO SEE THAT COUNCILMEMBER 
KENG MADE
21:43:06  THIS REFERRAL.
I WOULD -- DO I
21:43:09  UNDERSTAND 
WHAT -- I'M
21:43:13  GLAD CITY MANAGER 
SHACKELFORD SAID WHAT SHE
21:43:16  SAID.
IT'S A VERY GOOD POINT.
I WOULD ALSO
21:43:19  SUGGEST THAT THERE 
MAY BE OTHER FUNDING SOURCES 
AVAILABLE AS WELL.
21:43:22 
SO I WONDER IF WE COULD HAVE
21:43:26 , 
MAYBE I COULD MAKE A FRIENDLY 
AMENDMENT THAT WE DIRECT STAFF
21:43:29  
TO RESEARCH AVAILABLE GRANTS FOR 
U BMPTI
21:43:33 BI PROGRAMS AND THEN
21:43:37  REPORT 
BACK ON WHAT IS AVAILABLE.
BUT ITS
21:43:40  DEFINITELY THINK IT IS 
SOMETHING WE SHOULD BE PURSUING.
A LOT OF
21:43:43  CITIES ARE DOING IT AND 
HAVE SEEN SUCCESS WITH IT.
21:43:46 
AND IT REALLY -- I THINK THE 
EVIDENCE --
21:43:49  I HAVEN'T CAREFULLY 
LOOK AT ALL THE DATA
21:43:53  BUT I THINK 
THE DATA DOES SHOW IT'S MUCH 
CHEAP
21:43:56 ER TO ADMINISTER THAN A LOT 
OF OTHER PROGRAMS BECAUSE YOU 
DON'T HAVE
21:43:59  TO GO THROUGH THE 
WHOLE PROCESS OF DETERMINING 
WHO'S ELIGIBLE
21:44:02 .
IT IS JUST A SIMPLE PAYOUT OF A 
REGULAR CHECK
21:44:05  AND PEOPLE, FROM 
WHAT HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATE
21:44:08 ED SO 
FAR PEOPLE DO USE THAT FUNDING 
FOR
21:44:11  THINGS THAT ARE 
SUPER-IMPORTANT FOR THEIR LIVING
21:44:16 
LIVING.
21:44:20 
SO I VERY MUCH SUPPORT THIS AND 
I'M SYMPATHETIC
21:44:23  WITH THE IDEA 
THAT WE MAY NOT BE QUITE READY 
FOR STAFF TO
21:44:26  APPLY FOR GRANTS 
BUT I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE IT 
BEYOND THE
21:44:29  TWO FUNDING SOURCES 
THAT ARE MENTIONED IN THE 
REFERRAL
21:44:33 .
BECAUSE PEOPLE IN STAFF THERE 
ARE VERY SKILLED AT
21:44:36  FINDING 
GRANT OPPORTUNITIES.
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IF THEY CAN
21:44:39  
GO BEYOND THOSE TWO POTENTIAL 
OPPORTUNITIES
21:44:42 .
>> Mayor Mei:   OKAY.
21:44:52 
COUNCILMEMBER JONES.
LJ THANK YOU MADAM MAYOR PAP 

21:45:03 >> Councilmember Jones:   THANK 
YOU MAYOR.
YOU ARE LOOKING UNDER
21:45:08  AB 155 --
>> Mayor Mei:   153
21:45:11 .
>> Councilmember Jones:   153
21:45:14 .
THERE IS ALSO ONE UNDER 1
21:45:16 65.
IT DOESN'T APPLY TO MILES AN 
HOUR.

21:45:19 I'M IN AGREEMENT WITH CITY 
MANAGER
21:45:23  SHACKELFORD.
IT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING YOU 
COULD LOOK
21:45:26  AT WE ARE ABLE TO 
PROCEED BUT STARTING
21:45:29  THE 
APPLICATION PROCESS AND TYING UP 
THOSE RESOURCES, I WOULD LIKE TO
21:45:31  
SEE WHAT'S AVAILABLE FIRST, 
THANK YOU.

21:45:35 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.
I WOULD LIKE TO COMMENT ON THIS
21:45:39 .
I'VE HEARD SOME OF THE 
PRESENTATIONS
21:45:42  FROM SOME OF MY 
FELLOW MUNICIPALITIES ON U
21:45:45 BI AND 
I KNOW SOME OTHER CITIES HAVE
21:45:48  
BEEN FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO HAVE
21:45:52  
RECEIVED SIGNIFICANT REVENUE 
STREAMS FROM
21:45:56  PHILANTHROPY 
ORGANIZATIONS AND THAT MAKES IT 
ELIGIBLE FOR SUCH
21:45:59  AS ENRICHMENT 
AND IN OAKLAND WHERE THEY 
TARGETED
21:46:03  SPECIFICALLY CERTAIN 
POPULATIONS AND IN FACT HAD SOME 
RESTRICTIONS
21:46:06  THAT VERY MUCH 
LIMITED AND FOCUSED THE 
ATTENTION ON WHICH THEY
21:46:10  WERE 
TRYING TO DELIVER THE UBI.
I
21:46:13  CERTAINLY HAVE REACHED OUT TO 
STAFF AND I KNOW WE
21:46:16  WORK VERY  
CLOSELY AND
21:46:19  WOULD WANT TO FLY 
FOR GRANTS.
BUT AM PRAG MATS
21:46:22  PRAGMATIC
21:46:25 , MAKING SURE 
STAFF HAS THE BANDWIDTH
21:46:29  TO BE 
ABLE TO APPLY FOR THESE GRANTS, 
AND WE ALWAYS SEARCH
21:46:32  FOR OTHER 
FUNDING SOURCES BUT I'M ALSO
21:46:35  
CONSCIOUS OF THE TIME IT TAKES.
AND I'D DEFER TO
21:46:38  OUR STAFF IN 
TERMS OF WHAT THEY CAN
21:46:41  AND 
CANNOT APPLY FOR.
I CONCUR WITH VICE MAYOR SHAO 

21:46:44 WHICH IS THE IDEA WHETHER WE DO 
A PILOT, AND THAT IS
21:46:47  THE REASONS 
I SEE SO MANY OTHER PILOTS,
21:46:51  IT 
IS THE PROOF OF CONCEPT AND 
IDEALLY
21:46:54  IF THE PROOF OF CONCEPT 
IS SOMETHING ROBUST
21:46:56  IT IS 
SOMETHING WE WOULD WAND TO 
EXPAND.

21:46:59 I KNOW THAT SINCE I LOOK AT SO 
MANY DIFFERENT
21:47:02  GRANT 
OPPORTUNITIES AND I SEND THEM 
ALL THE TIME TO STAFF THEY'VE
21:47:05  
OFTEN TOLD ME WHAT IS FEASIBLE 
AND NOT FEASIBLE IN TERMS
21:47:08  OF 
APPLICATION, IN TERMS OF 
ADMINISTRATION AND THAT'S WHY 

21:47:12 WITH EVEN SOME OF THESE 
LEGISLATIVE POLICIES WHEN WE'VE 
MENTIONED
21:47:16  THESE BILLS, AB 153 OR 
AB
21:47:19  165, I SAY THE
21:47:22  CONCEPT IS IN 
GOOD SPIRIT BUT IN SOME TIMES 
THE ADMINISTRATION AND
21:47:25  THE 
DETAILS IS WHERE IT GETS STICKY.
SO
21:47:28  I'M SUPPORTIVE OF RESEARCHING 
THIS.
BUT I WOULD
21:47:31  AGAIN VERY MUCH 
SUPPORT THE CITY MANAGER'S
21:47:35  
CONVERSATION IN TERMS OF 
RESEARCHING WHAT TYPES OF GRANTS
21:47:38  
AND OPPORTUNITIES ARE AVAILABLE 
FOR UBI OR OTHER FUNDING
21:47:41 .
I THINK THAT I ALSO WOULD CONCUR 
WITH COUNCILMEMBER COX IS
21:47:45  THAT 
THERE MAY BE SOME CONFUSION IN 
TERMS OF WHAT AREAS
21:47:48  THAT WE'RE 
LOOKING AT.
BECAUSE IT MAY BE ALSO
21:47:50  THINGS 
THAT TIE DIRECTLY TO 
HOMELESSNESS.

21:47:54 WHEN WE MENTION THE PEOPLE WE 
ARE SEEING
21:47:57  ON KATO AND OTHER 
PLACES
21:48:00  THROUGHOUT THE CITY IN 
TENTS, UNFORTUNATELY
21:48:03 , I'VE GONE 
OUT AND PERSONALLY ADMINISTERED 
THE
21:48:07  POINT IN TIME COUNT.
BUT DIDN'T FLO
21:48:10  WHO HAD CHILDREN 
OR MILES AN HOUR IN THOSE.
COULD BE A
21:48:13  COMBINATION.
ONE OF THE PROGRAMS I'VE SEEN 
MOST RECENTLY
21:48:17  COMING FROM SAN 
FRANCISCO AND I'VE EXPRESSED TO 
THE CITY MANAGER I
21:48:20  THOUGHT WAS 
INTERESTING TOO WAS REGARDING
21:48:23  
SOMETHING MORE
21:48:26  ADMINISTERRABLE, 
WHEN IT COMES TO SMALL BUSINESS
21:48:29 
BUSINESSES PROVIDING SOMETHING 
LIKE A FIRST
21:48:33  YEAR
21:48:36  WAIVER OF THE 
LICENSING FEES.
21:48:39 
SOMETHING, A STRUCTURE THAT IS 
IN VERY MUCH CAN COMPETITION,
21:48:43  
WHEN YOU TALKED ABOUT EARLIER 
COUNCILMEMBER KENG IF JOBS OR
21:48:46  
COMPANIES WERE TO DISAPPEAR AND 
THOSE ARE THINGS THAT AFFECT NOT
21:48:49  
JUST ONE HOUSEHOLD BUT MULTIPLE 
HOUSEHOLDS IN
21:48:52  THAT PERSPECTIVE.
SO I WOULD DEFER TO STAFF IN 
TERMS
21:48:55  OF SUPPORTING
21:48:59  THE 
APPLICATION OR UNDERSTANDING THE
21:49:01  
RESEARCH.
WE'RE NOT GOING TO APPLY RIGHT 

21:49:04 NOW IT SOUNDS LIKE RIGHT NOW BUT 
TO UNDERSTAND WHAT TYPES
21:49:08  OF 
GRANTS ARE OUT THERE FOR 
UNIVERSAL BASIC INCOME
21:49:11  AS FAR AS 
SOME OF THE ADDITIONAL AT RISK.
I KNOW COUNCILMEMBER COX
21:49:14  ALSO 
MENTIONED THINGS OF CONCERN BUT 
THOSE
21:49:17  ARE PROBABLY EDUCATION AND 
THINGS YOU WERE ASKING
21:49:20  ABOUT IN 
CARPS, OR IS THAT SOMETHING ELSE
21:49:23  -- YOU'RE NOT TALKING 
SPECIFICALLY ABOUT UNIVERSAL
21:49:27  
BASIC INCOME WITH THE STUDENTS 
THAT ARE SCHOLARSHIPS AND STUFF, 

21:49:30 THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING YOU 
WORKED WITH OHLONE OR OTHER 
COMMUNITY COLLEGES ON
21:49:33 .

21:49:37 >> Councilmember Cox:   BECAUSE 
THEY DO HAVE AT OHLONE THEY DO
21:49:40  
HAVE SPECIAL PROGRAMS FOR THAT 
AND STUDENTS GO THERE FREE
21:49:43 .
SO JUST MAKING SURE WE KIND OF 
UNDERSTAND
21:49:47  THE START IS I GUESS 
TO JUST DO THE RESEARCH FIRST
21:49:51  
AND THEN COME BACK WITH WHAT IS 
FOUND
21:49:53 .
>> Mayor Mei:   SURE.
>> Councilmember Cox:   I KNOW 

21:49:57 SOMETIMES WE DO HAVE LIKE 
WORKING RULES.
I DON'T KNOW HOW THIS IS DONE
21:50:00  ON 
CITY COUNCIL.
BUT IF IT GETS PASSED AN HOUR
21:50:03  OF 
RESEARCH THEN THAT'S WHERE THEY 
KIND OF DRAW THE LINE
21:50:07  AND SAYING 
WE DID RESEARCH AND JUST FOUND 
WHAT WE COULD FIND
21:50:10 , HOUR, HOUR 
AND A HALF, THEY KIND OF LIMIT 
IT BECAUSE OF THE
21:50:14  SHORTAGE OF 
THE AMOUNT OF WORK THAT STILL 
HAS TO BE DONE TO CARRY
21:50:17  THIS 
CITY OUT AND KIND OF JOIN THE 
BALANCING OF
21:50:19  THIS SPECIAL 
PROJECT.
BUT I'LL LEAVE THAT TO THE 

21:50:23 DIRECTION OF OUR CITY MANAGER TO 
WHATEVER
21:50:26  WE DECIDE AT THIS POINT 
TONIGHT
21:50:29 .
>> Mayor Mei:   OKAY, THANK YOU.
21:50:35 
AND I ALSO SEE THAT WE HAVE SOME 
PUBLIC SPEAKERS ON THIS COMMENT
21:50:40 .
21:50:45 
THANK YOU.
LISA DAN
21:50:48 S.
TWO MINUTES PLEASE.
>> MY NAME IS LISA
21:50:52  DANS AND I'M 
A FREMONT RESIDENT AND
21:50:55  A MEMBER 
OF FREMONT FOR EVERYONE TEAM.
FREMONT
21:50:58  FOR EVERYONE ENDORSES 
COUNCILMEMBER KENG
21:51:02 'S FOR 
PREGNANT PEOPLE AND FOSTER CARE 
TRANSITION
21:51:05 AL YOUTH.
WE HAVE A CRITICAL NEED TO
21:51:08  
PREVENT HOMELESSNESS FOR PEOPLE 
WHO ARE AT RISK OF LOSE
21:51:11 ING THEIR 
HOMES.
BECOMING HOMELESS AS
21:51:15  TEENS AND 
NEVER BROKE OUT OF THE CYCLE
21:51:18  OF 
HOMELESSNESS, WE BELIEVE THIS
21:51:22  
ISSUE IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT 
DIRECTION.

21:51:25 THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU, NEXT 
SPEAKER, BLAIR BEEKMAN
21:51:28 .
>> HI THANK YOU, THANKS A
21:51:32  LOT 
FOR THIS ITEM.
I'M SORRY TO SOUND SO
21:51:35  ABSOLUTE 
IN MY PREVIOUS PUBLIC COMMENT, I 
DON'T
21:51:38  KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT IN THE 
NEXT FEW YEARS, I'M JUST TRYING 
TO
21:51:41  FIGURE OUT HOW TO ASK AND 
TALK ABOUT IT.
21:51:44 
VERY SORRY FOR MY ABSOLUTIST 
TONE, I
21:51:47  DON'T WANT DO HAVE SUCH 
A TONE.
IT WAS MENTIONED
21:51:50  THAT FOR THIS 
ITEM AS WELL THE CONCEPTS OF 
FUNDING FOR PROGRAMS.
21:51:54 
AND I JUST WANTED TO MENTION 
AGAIN, YOU KNOW, THE
21:51:57  GOOD THERE 
IS IN STATE AND FEDERAL SUBSIDY
21:52:01  
PLANS THAT ARE HAPPENING AT THIS 
TIME.

21:52:04 AND I'M TRYING TO LEARN THAT, 
YOU KNOW, HOW TO SAY THE
21:52:07  WORDS 
THAT, YOU KNOW, IT'S LEARNING 
HOW TO BE OPEN, HOW
21:52:10  TO TALK 
ABOUT IT, AS LOCAL GOVERNMENT, 
HOW
21:52:13  TO SHARE THAT WITH COMMUNITY 
BETTER WHICH IS WHAT YOU'RE 
DOING WITH THIS
21:52:16  ITEM, THANK YOU.
AND FOR EVERY
21:52:20 DAY COMMUNITY TO 
LEARN HOW TO ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT 
THE FUNDING
21:52:23  AND SUBSIDIES THAT 
ARE AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.
AND
21:52:27  IT'S IMPORTANT COMBINATION 
WE'RE TRYING TO LEARN IN
21:52:30  THIS 
NEW ERA OF COVID-19 AND IT'S 
ABOUT OPEN
21:52:33 NESS AND BEING MORE 
CLEAR AND UNDERSTANDING WITH 
EACH OTHER AND
21:52:36  THIS ITEM WAS 
VERY GOOD AT
21:52:39  EXPLAINS WHAT CAN 
BE POSSIBLE
21:52:42  AT THIS TIME.
SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR HELP.
AND GOOD
21:52:46  WORK.
THANKS.
21:52:52 
>> Mayor Mei:   NEXT SPEAKER IS 
KAY SHARE.

21:52:56 WELCOME.
21:53:02 
I APOLOGIZE MR. SHARE YOUR MIC 
IS ON
21:53:06  MUTE.
>> THANK YOU, MADAM MAYOR, 
DIDN'T REALIZE
21:53:09  THAT.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, MY NAME
21:53:12  IS 
HAYES SHARE, A RESIDENT
21:53:16  OF 
SUNDALE, I'M
21:53:19  SPEAKING IN 
REFERENCE TO
21:53:22  COUNCILMEMBER 
KENG'S REFERENCE, UBI
21:53:26 .
I WAS INITIALLY SKEPTICAL BUT 
AFTER SPEAKING
21:53:30  WITH FOLKS WITH 
LIVED EXPERIENCE, ESPECIALLY FOR
21:53:33  
THOSE WHO HAVE APPLIED FOR 
PUBLIC ASSISTANCE
21:53:36 , UBI DOES MAKE 
SENSE.
21:53:40 
SIMPLY TO GO THROUGH THE PROCESS 
OF GET RENTAL
21:53:43  ASSISTANCE HAS 
SEVERAL FLAWS.
EITHER IT'S SO ONEROUS
21:53:47  OR OPAQUE 
THAT IT
21:53:51  TOO HIGH INCOME TO 
QUALIFY OR RESULTS IN A
21:53:54  MERE ONE 
TIME PAYMENT WHICH IS NOT ENOUGH 
TO PREVENT LONG
21:53:57  TERM 
HOMELESSNESS.
IN ORDER TO GUARANTEE
21:54:01  STABILITY 
IN SOMEONE'S LIFE YOU HAVE TO 
GUARANTEE MONTH
21:54:04 LY STIMULUS 
WITHOUT HAVING THEM FORCE
21:54:08 ED TO 
JUMP THROUGH HOOPS.
THIS IS THE
21:54:11  SAME PRINCIPLE 
BEHIND OUR ON AND OFF GAITION 
CENTER AND
21:54:15  OUR RECENT EFFORTS,
21:54:18  
BOTH PROGRAMS RELY ON GOOD FAITH 
TRUST PLACED ON
21:54:21  THE 
PARTICIPANTS.
30 ABOUT THE HOUSING
21:54:25  FIRST 
MODEL, HOW THAT STARTED AS A 
RADICAL
21:54:29  PRACTICE.
I APPLAUD COUNCIL FOR STUDYING
21:54:32  
NOT ONLY THE FUNDING SOURCES 
MENTIONED BUT
21:54:36  TO BROADEN THE 
FOCUS.
THERE ARE OTHER FUNDING STREAMS.

21:54:39 WHAT ABOUT THAT PACKAGE THAT WAS 
JUST SIGNED BY
21:54:42  GOVERNOR NEWSOM 
LAST FRIDAY.
PREVENTS
21:54:45  HOMELESSNESS AND 
HOUSING PLACEMENT.
OUT OF RESPECT
21:54:49  FOR HUMAN 
SERVICES DIVISION GRANT
21:54:52  WRITING 
IS A LOT OF WORK BUT WE HAVE THE 
OPPORTUNITY
21:54:55  OF BEING AN 
INNOVATOR
21:54:59 , ONE OF THE MOST 
EXPENSIVE HOUSING MARKETS IN THE 
COUNTRY
21:55:02 .
THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU
21:55:06 .
SO
21:55:09  I'M BRINGING IT BACK NOW TO 
THE COUNCIL AND I'M
21:55:12  CLOSING THE 
PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD.
AND I BELIEVE THAT WE HEARD
21:55:16  A 
MOTION TO PROCEED IN TERMS OF 
RESEARCHING WHAT TYPES
21:55:19  OF GRANTS 
ARE AVAILABLE.
I WOULD ALSO AGREE
21:55:22  WITH 
COUNCILMEMBER COX THAT THERE 
NEEDS TO BE
21:55:26  SOME WRAP AROUND IN 
TERMS OF WHAT I WOULD DEFER
21:55:29  TO 
THE CITY MANAGER THE TIME THAT 
WOULD BE SPENT OR THE ALLOCATION
21:55:32  
FOR RESEARCHING THIS AND SEEING 
WHAT'S -- I THINK THAT EVERY
21:55:36  
TIME, AS PACKAGES ARE BEING 
PRESENTED, WHETHER IT'S
21:55:39  AT THE 
STATE, FEDERAL OR LOCAL LEVEL, 
OUR
21:55:42  STAFF, INCLUDING OUR HUMAN 
SERVICES AND THE
21:55:46  CITY MANAGER, 
ARE LOOKING AT OUR OVERALL GUIDE
21:55:48  
GUIDING PRINCIPLES WHICH COME 
FROM OUR LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES 

21:55:52 TO LOOK AT WHAT TYPES OF 
ANALYSIS WE CAN AND CERTAINLY
21:55:55  WE 
ARE
21:55:59  SEEKING ALL SORTS OF GRANTS 
THAT ARE AVAILABLE.
21:56:03 
SO IS THERE A MOTION TO STUDY 
THIS AND LEAVING THIS WITHIN
21:56:07  THE 
CONFINES OF THE CITY MANAGER?
I WOULD ALSO LIKE
21:56:10  TO UNDERSTAND 
THOUGH, WHAT TIME FRAME WOULD
21:56:13  WE 
BE REPORT BACK WHAT WE DO THINK 
IN TERMS
21:56:16  OF CITY MANAGER 
SHACKELFORD WOULD BE
21:56:20  REASONABLE?
>> Karena Shackelford:   I'M 
GOING TO DEFER
21:56:23  THAT QUESTION TO 
OUR HUMAN SERVICES DIRECTOR
21:56:26  
SUZANNE SHENFIL
21:56:29 .
SUZANNE.
21:56:32 
>> Suzanne Shenfil:   SURE.
>> Mayor Mei:   SORRY, SUZANNE
21:56:36  
YOU'RE ON MUTE AGAIN.
SORRY YOU'RE STILL
21:56:39  ON MUTE.
NO, YOU'RE STILL ON
21:56:42  MUTE.
>> Suzanne Shenfil:   THERE
21:56:45  WE 
GO, SORRY ABOUT THAT.
GOOD
21:56:49 .
YOU KNOW, WE'VE DONE A
21:56:52  LITTLE 
RESEARCH BASED ON THE FACT THAT 
THIS ITEM WAS COMING TO
21:56:56  COUNCIL.
SO I WOULD SAY, AND SO
21:56:59  WE HAVE 
SOME MODELS THAT WE'VE LOOKED AT 
AND WE
21:57:02  COULD PROBABLY PULL 
INFORMATION TOGETHER.
SO I WOULD SAY WE
21:57:06  COULD GET BACK 
TO YOU BY EARLY DECEMBER,
21:57:09  IF 
THAT --
>> Mayor Mei:  
21:57:12  SURE, THAT WE 
COULD UNDERSTAND --
21:57:14 
>> Suzanne Shenfil:   UNDERSTAND 
WHAT ARE THE PROGRAMS.

21:57:17 THERE IS A LOT OF DIFFERENT 
USAGE.
21:57:20 
THERE IS UNIVERSAL BASIC INCOME 
WHICH WE'VE TALKED ABOUT TONIGHT
21:57:24  
BUT THERE IS ALSO GUARANTEED 
INCOME PILOTS THAT ARE BEING
21:57:27  
DONE BY CITIES, YOU KNOW, ACROSS 
THE STATE
21:57:32 .
AND THEY HAVE DIFFERENT TARGET 
POPULATIONS
21:57:35  AND THEY ARE FUNDED 
IN DIFFERENT WAYS AND I THINK WE
21:57:38  
COULD FAIRLY EASILY PUT TOGETHER 
A MATRIX AND TALK
21:57:41  ABOUT WHAT THE 
DIFFERENT MODELS ARE TRYING TO 
ACCOMPLISH
21:57:45  AND HOW THEY'RE BEING 
FUNDED.
SO IF YOU GIVE
21:57:48  US UNTIL EARLY 
DECEMBER, I 30
21:57:51  WE CAN GET B
21:57:54  THINK WE CAN GET
21:57:57  
BACK TO YOU WITH A GOOD OVERVIEW
21:58:02 
OVERVIEW.
>> Karena Shackelford:   MADAM
21:58:05  
MAYOR, I JUST WANTED TO ADD TO 
SUZANNE
21:58:10 'S, WITH THAT 
UNDERSTANDING, I DON'T THINK
21:58:14  WE 
WOULD BE EXCEED
21:58:17 ING COUNCILMEMBER 
KENG'S REFERRAL.

21:58:20 >> Mayor Mei:   WHEN YOU COME UP 
WITH THAT, I'D LIKE TO NOE
21:58:23  
ASSOCIATED WITH THE RESEARCH 
YOU'RE LOOKING AT,
21:58:26  WOULD YOU BE 
ABLE TO ADMINISTER, IF THERE ARE
21:58:30  
ADDITIONAL ADMINISTRATION COSTS 
AND BEING A PILOT I KNOW THAT
21:58:33  
HAVING BEEN INVOLVEDIN MANY OF 
THESE PROBABLY THE SCALABILITY,
21:58:37  
I THINK THAT GENERALLY WHAT I'VE 
SEEN IN SO MANY
21:58:40  OF THE PILOTS 
ESPECIALLY FOR YEAR 1 OR 2 OF 
THE STUFF IS
21:58:43  A VERY SPECIFIC 
TARGETED LIMITED
21:58:46  SCOPE NOT A 
BROAD BASED BECAUSE IT IS
21:58:49  NOT 
SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE EASILY 
ADMINISTERED
21:58:53 , EITHER.
THAT IS SOMETHING WE COULD 
CONSIDER IF
21:58:56  WE WERE ABLE TO 
SUCCEED IN
21:58:59  GETTING GRANTS.
IN SOME OF THE CITIES THAT WE'VE 
MENTION
21:59:02 ED IT WOULD BE NICE IF 
ANY
21:59:06  PHILANTHROPIC ORGANIZATION 
WOULD LIKE TO OFFER US THE 
MILLIONS
21:59:09  IN SOME OF THE CITIES 
THAT ARE BEING PROVIDED.
IF ANYBODY IN
21:59:12  OUR BUSINESSES 
WANTS TO DROP $10 MILLION OR 
WHATEVER ON
21:59:15  US WE WOULD 
CERTAINLY BE VERY EXCITED AND 
HAPPY TO
21:59:18  ADMINISTER SOME OF 
THESE.
BUT THAT IS WHAT I SAW WAS
21:59:21  ONE 
OF THE KEY FACTORS IN RICHMOND 
AND OAKLAND AND
21:59:25  OTHER CITIES 
THAT WERE ABLE TO START SOME OF 
THESE PROGRAMS IS THAT THEY
21:59:27  WERE 
ABLE TO CREATE SOME FUNDING 
SOURCES
21:59:31  THAT WERE SUSTAINABLE 
AND THAT WERE ABLE TO HELP
21:59:34  THEM 
FOCUS ON SPECIFIC GOALS.
21:59:37 
>> Suzanne Shenfil:   RIGHT.
MANY OF THESE PROJECTS ARE ALSO 

21:59:40 AFFILIATED WITH UNIVERSITIES
21:59:44  
THAT ARE ANALYZING THE RESULTS 
OF THE PROJECT OVER A
21:59:47  YEAR OR 
TWO YEARS TO SEE IF THEY'RE 
REALLY MEETING
21:59:50  GOALS AND 
OBJECTIVES.
SO I THINK THAT WOULD NEED TO BE 

21:59:54 PART OF ANY KIND OF 
DEMONSTRATION OR PILOT IF
21:59:57  WE 
WERE TO UNDERTAKE IT.
>> Mayor Mei:   YES
22:00:00 .
I ABSOLUTELY CONCUR.
22:00:03 
SO DO WE HAVE A MOTION?
I THINK --
22:00:06  I'M HAPPY TO MOVE 
THIS STUDY FURTHER BUT AGAIN
22:00:09  TO 
GET THE REPORT BACK FROM STAFF 
IN DECEMBER AS TO
22:00:13  WHETHER OR NOT 
THERE IS SOMETHING THAT'S 
FEASIBLE IN TERMS
22:00:16  OF --
>> MADAM MAYOR IT APPEARS
22:00:19  THAT 
COUNCILMEMBER COX'S HAND IS UP.
>> Mayor Mei:   OKAY,
22:00:22  MY 
APOLOGIES.
COUNCILMEMBER COX.

22:00:25 >> Councilmember Cox:   YES, I 
JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE I KNOW 
WHAT THE
22:00:28  REFERRAL THAT'S BEEN 
PUBLISHED, BUT I THINK WE'RE
22:00:31  
KIND OF
22:00:37  TAKING A LITTLE BIT OF A 
SMALLER STEP TO BE ABLE
22:00:40  TO 
EXPLORE THIS INITIATIVE AND I 
THINK IN MY OPINION TO BE
22:00:44  MORE 
TRANSPARENT AND ACCOUNTABLE
22:00:47  IS 
TO MAKE SURE, IF THERE'S A 
FRIENDLY AMENDMENT
22:00:50  OR SOMETHING 
TO BE CORRECTED IN THE
22:00:53  RECORD TO 
REFLECT THAT AT THIS POINT, IF 
WE
22:00:57  ALL DECIDE, THAT WE WOULD 
LOOK AT IT AS EXPLORATORY
22:01:01  OF 
LOOKING FOR THESE TYPE OF
22:01:04  GRANTS 
TO SUPPORT THOSE THAT ARE EITHER 
UNG
22:01:07  
UNSHELTER
22:01:11 ED OR STUDENTS OR IN
22:01:14  A
22:01:19  
PACIFIC RIM SO IT'S DEDICATED 
FOR
22:01:22  THAT PACIFIC AREA WHAT WAS 
ORIGINAL
22:01:26 LY APPROVED TO GET THE 
GRANTS AND APPLY IT.
I WANT TO
22:01:29  MAKE SURE WE'RE BEING 
TRANSPARENT AND BEING CLEAR WHAT 
THE
22:01:32  DIRECTION IS FOR THE CITY 
STAFF WOULD OUR
22:01:36  INTERIM CITY 
ATTORNEY OR CITY MANAGER RESPOND 
TO
22:01:39  THAT?
22:01:45 
WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS?
I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR
22:01:48  WHAT OUR 
STEPS ARE HERE
22:01:51 .
>> Karena Shackelford:   I'M NOT 
SURE A MOTION HAS BEEN MADE YET
22:01:54 , 
IS THERE?
>> Mayor Mei:   I WAS GOING TO 

22:01:57 MAKE ONE BASED ON ONE OF THE 
THINGS HERE.
>> Councilmember Keng:   CAN I 

22:02:01 MAKE THE MOTION?
>> Mayor Mei:   ARE YOU GOING TO 
MODIFY IT WITH THE
22:02:03  COMMENTS?
>> Councilmember Keng:   YES, OF 
COURSE.

22:02:06 >> Mayor Mei:   SO WHAT IS YOUR 
PROPOSED MOTION, GO AHEAD
22:02:08 ,.
>> Councilmember Keng:   I 
MOTION FOR COUNCIL TO DIRECT 

22:02:12 STAFF TO RESEARCH AVAILABLE 
GRANTS AND
22:02:15  TO MAKE -- TO
22:02:19  MAKE A 
MATRIX AND PROGRAMS AVAILABLE
22:02:22  
FOR FAMILIES AT RISK
22:02:26 .
22:02:31 
>> Mayor Mei:   DO WE WANT TO 
FOCUS ON FAMILIES AT RISK
22:02:34 ?
>> Councilmember Keng:   
ACTUALLY ON FAMILIES SO IT'S A 

22:02:37 LITTLE BIT MORE BROAD.
>> Councilmember Cox:   I'M 
SORRY WHAT DID YOU
22:02:40  JUST SAY?
>> Councilmember Keng:   
INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES AT RISK
22:02:45 
RISK.
22:02:49 
>> Karena Shackelford:   I'M 
SORRY COUNCILMEMBER KENG COULD 

22:02:53 YOU REPEAT THAT?
WHEN WE COME BACK IN DECEMBER WE 
WANT
22:02:56  TO MAKE SURE WE'RE GIVING 
YOU EXACTLY WHAT
22:03:00  IT IS YOU'RE 
REQUESTING OR DIRECTING US TO 
DO.
22:03:02 
>> Councilmember Keng:   YES 
THANK YOU, MOTION FOR COUNCIL TO 

22:03:06 DIRECT STAFF TO RESEARCH 
AVAILABLE GRANTS FOR
22:03:09  A UBI PILOT 
PROGRAM
22:03:13  TO AID INDIVIDUALS AND 
FAMILIES OF LOW INCOME AT
22:03:16  RISK.
22:03:21 
>> Councilmember Cox:   SECOND.
>> Mayor Mei:   OKAY, MOTION AND

22:04:13  WAS GOING TO SAY 
ARE THERE ANY REPORTS-OUT FROM
22:04:16  
MEETINGS?
I WILL REPORT
22:04:19  OUT QUICKLY.
22:04:22 
THAT ALAMEDA COUNTY 
TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION 

22:04:26 THERE'S BEEN SOME UPSTAIRS,  
TALKING
22:04:29  ABOUT STUDENTS AND 
ACCESS IN SAFE ROUTES TO SCHOOL
22:04:32  
AND HOW THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO 
PROVIDE THAT CEAS ASK
22:04:36  ACCESS.
THEY HAD THE SIMILAR REPORT
22:04:40  IN 
YEAR 1, 2 AND 3, I'D BE HAPPY TO
22:04:43  
SHARE THAT REPORT WITH YOU.
I KNOW WE WERE TALKING EARLIER
22:04:46  
THIS EVENING ABOUT INITIATIVES 
THAT
22:04:49  PER
22:04:58  PER TAKENNED
22:05:05  PERTAINED TO ORGANIC WASTE
22:05:09 .
WE'VE HAD SOME CONVERSATIONS 
ABOUT ELECTRIFICATION
22:05:13  OF OUR 
FLEET AND JOINT EFFORTS THAT 
HOPEFULLY WE CAN WORK
22:05:16  ON  
ADDRESSING
22:05:20  COLLABORATIVELY, 
WITHIN THE COMMUNITY'S 
PARTICIPATION
22:05:22  BEING GREEN.
I LOOK FORWARD TO THESE 
CONTINUED CONVERSATIONS.

22:05:25 I WANTED TO THANK THE COMMUNITY 
MEMBERS AND STAFF FOR HELPING US 
REACH
22:05:29  THE VACCINATION RATE.
I WANTED TO SHARE A
22:05:32  A BRIEF UPDATE 
THAT AS OF
22:05:35  TWO DAYS AGO WE ARE 
FULLY VACCINATED
22:05:39  AT 88% AS A 
CITY.
SO I WANTED TO THANK THE 

22:05:42 COMMUNITY ON THAT EFFORT.
OTHER THAN THAT I JUST ASK 
EVERYONE TO PLEASE, WE
22:05:45  TALKED 
ABOUT SO MANY DIFFERENT GROUPS 
THIS EVENING, AND
22:05:49  AGAIN, AS 
FREMONT IS HOME TO INCEDE
22:05:52  IBLGHT 
ETHNIC DIVERSITY,
22:05:55  CULTURAL 
DIVERSITY AND OTHER PERSPECTIVES 
THAT WE
22:05:59  SHOULD TRY TO STRIVE TO 
BE KIND TO ONE
22:06:02  ANOTHER, TO BE 
UNITED AGAINST HATE.
WHICH MEANS
22:06:05  RESPECT AND WORKING 
WITH ONE ANOTHER WHICH IS 
SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD
22:06:08  ALL 
STRIVE FOR AS A COMMUNITY.
22:06:11 
AND ESPECIALLY IF WE LOOK AT 
SOME OF THE THINGS RIGHT NOW I 

22:06:15 JUST WANTED TO MENTION I WOULD 
LIKE TO PAUSE IN A MOMENT OF
22:06:18  
SILENCE BECAUSE THERE HAVE BEEN
22:06:21  
ANOTHER I GUESS MILESTONE IN 
TERMS OF THE NUMBER OF
22:06:25  DEATHS 
THAT WE'VE HAD FROM COVID THAT 
IS VERY TRAGIC IN TERMS OF 

22:06:28 NUMBERS THAT WE'VE SEEN AND SO 
I'D JUST LIKE TO
22:06:31  PAUSE IN A 
MOMENT OF SILENCE BEFORE WE END.
22:06:34 
THANK YOU.
[ MOMENT OF SILENCE ]
22:06:45 
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU FOR 
YOUR SUPPORT.

22:06:48 THANK YOU FOR BEING KIND TO ONE 
ANOTHER AND LOOK FORWARD TO
22:06:51

FULLY, COLLATERAL OR MENTALLY.

22:06:58  A GOOD EVENING.

22:07:03
