[Captioner] 19:16:56
ONE OF THE GREAT CITIES TO RAISE

 FINEST, FIRST 35 YEARS I WAS

[Captioner] 19:17:16
FOLLOW ME AROUND, MAKE SURE I 

[Captioner] 19:17:17
KNEW WHERE I WAS GOING.

[Captioner] 19:17:18
THEY WOULD STOP ME PERIODICALLY 

[Captioner] 19:17:21

[Captioner] 19:17:21
HERE?

[Captioner] 19:17:24
AND I MEAN, ONE DAY I WAS OUT, 

[Captioner] 19:17:25

[Captioner] 19:17:27
WERE CONCERNED THAT I DIDN'T 

[Captioner] 19:17:27
HAVE ENOUGH WORK.

[Captioner] 19:17:30

[Captioner] 19:17:35
12-FOOT ITALIAN CYPRESS HEDGE

[Captioner] 19:17:53

HOW MUCH DO THEY PAY YOU TO DO 

[Captioner] 19:17:55
THAT?

[Captioner] 19:17:57
[LAUGHTER]

[Captioner] 19:18:00
I SAID WELL, THEY DON'T PAY ME 

[Captioner] 19:18:01
ANYTHING, BUT IF I DO A GOOD 

[Captioner] 19:18:02
JOB, TONIGHT I GET TO SLEEP WITH 

[Captioner] 19:18:03
THE LADY OF THE HOUSE.

[Captioner] 19:18:05
SO THEY SAID OKAY.

[Captioner] 19:18:10
HE SAID OKAY, I SAID YOU SURE 

[Captioner] 19:18:11
YOU WANT ME TO DO YOURS?

[Captioner] 19:18:11

[Captioner] 19:18:14

>> Mayor Mei: THAT'S FINE.

[Captioner] 19:21:22
>> I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT THE 

[Captioner] 19:21:23
HUGE IMPACT THAT DR. EDWARDS HAS 

[Captioner] 19:21:25
HAD ON AMERICAN HISTORY AND 

[Captioner] 19:21:26
WORLD HISTORY.

[Captioner] 19:21:28
THE BLACK POWER SALUTE AT THE 

[Captioner] 19:21:33
MEXICO CITY GAMES IN 1968

[Captioner] 19:21:35
 WAS JUST AS CONTROVERSIAL AND 

[Captioner] 19:21:39
JUST AS OUTRAGEOUS AS THE 

[Captioner] 19:21:41
KAEPERNICK TAKE A KNEE STUFF 

[Captioner] 19:21:41
MORE RECENTLY.

[Captioner] 19:21:47
"TIME" MAGAZINE WROTE THAT 

[Captioner] 19:21:48
FASTER, HIGHER, STRONGER IS THE 

[Captioner] 19:21:49
OLYMPIC MOTTO AND THE MOTTO OF 

[Captioner] 19:21:52
THE MEXICO GAMES WAS ANGRIER, 

[Captioner] 19:21:53
NASTIER, UGLIER.

[Captioner] 19:21:58
AS THE BLOW BACK TO THE

[Captioner] 19:22:00
 ANGER, THE BLOW BACK TO THESE 

[Captioner] 19:22:02
UPSTART ATHLETES WAS 

[Captioner] 19:22:02
INCREDIBLE.

[Captioner] 19:22:07
BRENT MUSTBERG CALLED THEM 

[Captioner] 19:22:08
JUVENILE, UNIMAGINATIVE.

[Captioner] 19:22:09
AND IT GOT WORSE FROM THERE.

[Captioner] 19:22:13
THEY KEPT -- IT WAS STILL 

[Captioner] 19:22:15
CONTROVERSIAL 20 YEARS LATER, 

[Captioner] 19:22:17
AND DR. EDWARDS WORKED FOR THE 

[Captioner] 19:22:19
SAN FRANCISCO 49ers, AND WHERE 

[Captioner] 19:22:20
DO YOU THINK KAEPERNICK WORKED?

[Captioner] 19:22:25
AND WHAT DO YOU THINK THE BLOW 

[Captioner] 19:22:26
BACK TO THE KAEPERNICK WAS?

[Captioner] 19:22:30
HAVE YOU HEARD THIS PHRASE 

[Captioner] 19:22:31
DUMPED BEND THE KNEE?

[Captioner] 19:22:35
THEY PUT THAT ON BANNERS

[Captioner] 19:22:36
 NOWADAYS.

[Captioner] 19:22:37
IT'S THE EXACT SAME THING ALL 

[Captioner] 19:22:38
OVER AGAIN.

[Captioner] 19:22:41
AND SO HE TALKED ABOUT HIS 

[Captioner] 19:22:42
CHILDREN WHEN PEOPLE -- THE 

[Captioner] 19:22:44
PARENTS HERE AND THE CHILDREN 

[Captioner] 19:22:48
HERE IN FREMONT, WHEN YOU WANT 

[Captioner] 19:22:52
TO GO SELECT A COLLEGE OR 

[Captioner] 19:22:54
UNIVERSITY, I'D SUGGEST 

[Captioner] 19:22:55
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, 

[Captioner] 19:22:56
BERKELEY, AND DR. EDWARDS WHO 

[Captioner] 19:22:58
WORKED THERE FOR MANY YEARS IS A 

[Captioner] 19:23:01
GOOD REASON WHY YOU SHOULD SEND 

[Captioner] 19:23:02
YOUR CHILDREN TO GO THERE.

[Captioner] 19:23:09
AND THEN ON THE PUBLIC COMMENT,

[Captioner] 19:23:12
 INCREDIBLE -- KAEPERNICK'S 

[Captioner] 19:23:16
WHOLE THING IS JUST A REPEAT OF

[Captioner] 19:23:19
 1968 AND THE BLOW BACK.

[Captioner] 19:23:23
AND THEN ON PUBLIC COMMENT, THIS 

[Captioner] 19:23:25
CITY'S FINANCES ARE INCREDIBLE, 

[Captioner] 19:23:26
BUT I DID A DEEPER DIVE INTO THE 

[Captioner] 19:23:26
STATE.

[Captioner] 19:23:28
YOU KNOW, THE CITY LIKES TO 

[Captioner] 19:23:30
POINT TO THE STATE AND SAY IT'S 

[Captioner] 19:23:31
ALL THE STATE'S FAULT.

[Captioner] 19:23:32
WELL, IF YOU LOOK AT THE GRAPH 

[Captioner] 19:23:34
OF THE STATE'S REVENUE 

[Captioner] 19:23:35
ESTIMATES, NOT THE TAXES, THE 

[Captioner] 19:23:37
TOTAL SALES REVENUE THAT WAS IN 

[Captioner] 19:23:40
QUESTION FOR THE SUBHEADING, THE 

[Captioner] 19:23:42
SUBSECTION OF OTHER RETAIL 

[Captioner] 19:23:45
SALES, THE CATEGORY WHICH IS IN 

[Captioner] 19:23:47
QUESTION HERE, THAT THING 

[Captioner] 19:23:50
STARTED EXPLODING BEYOND ITS 

[Captioner] 19:23:54
PEER GROUP AND TOOK A HUGE JUMP 

[Captioner] 19:23:55
AND STAYED HIGH FOR TWO YEARS 

[Captioner] 19:23:58
AND DO YOU KNOW THE AREA UNDER 

[Captioner] 19:24:00
THE CURVE THERE FOR YOU CALCULUS 

[Captioner] 19:24:00
MAJORS?

[Captioner] 19:24:03
IT WAS $6 BILLION.

[Captioner] 19:24:08
AND THIS CITY SITS BACK -- HAS

[Captioner] 19:24:10
 ACCOUNTANTS THAT SAY WELL, WE 

[Captioner] 19:24:11
DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON.

[Captioner] 19:24:14
$6BILLION WERE ASSIGNED TO THIS 

[Captioner] 19:24:16
CITY IN TERMS OF SALES REVENUE 

[Captioner] 19:24:20
THAT ARE A LITTLE BIT OF EXCESS, 

[Captioner] 19:24:22
UNEXPECTED, AND WE'RE 

[Captioner] 19:24:22
MISCATEGORIZED.

[Captioner] 19:24:25

[Captioner] 19:24:40
>> Mayor Mei: WELCOME.

[Captioner] 19:24:44
>> SO OBVIOUSLY THERE'S BEEN A 

[Captioner] 19:24:46
GREAT DEAL OF DEBATE, 

[Captioner] 19:24:47
DISCUSSION, AND ACTIVISM HERE IN 

[Captioner] 19:24:48
THE U.S. AND AROUND THE WORLD 

[Captioner] 19:24:50
WITH REGARD TO THE CONFLICT IN 

[Captioner] 19:24:51
ISRAEL AND GAZA.

[Captioner] 19:24:53
ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES 

[Captioner] 19:24:54
EVERYWHERE FROM LOCAL CITY 

[Captioner] 19:24:55
COUNCILS ALL THE WAY UP TO THE 

[Captioner] 19:24:57
PRESIDENT ARE FACING THIS 

[Captioner] 19:24:57
ISSUE.

[Captioner] 19:24:58
JUST THIS PAST WEEK, WE SAW 

[Captioner] 19:25:00
EVERYTHING FROM PRO HAMAS 

[Captioner] 19:25:02
SPEAKERS AT THE OAKLAND CITY 

[Captioner] 19:25:06
COUNCIL MEETING TO AN EM

[Captioner] 19:25:11
 EMPASSIONED PLEA FROM CHUCK

[Captioner] 19:25:11
 SCHUMER.

[Captioner] 19:25:14
NOVEMBER 18TH, THE EVENT WAS 

[Captioner] 19:25:17
SHUT DOWN DUE TO PRO PALESTINIAN 

[Captioner] 19:25:17
PROTESTORS.

[Captioner] 19:25:19
I HAVE NO DOUBT AS THE CITY 

[Captioner] 19:25:20
COUNCIL OF FREMONT YOU'RE ALL 

[Captioner] 19:25:22
FEELING THE PRESSURE TO JOIN THE 

[Captioner] 19:25:23
GROWING LIST OF CITIES WHO HAVE 

[Captioner] 19:25:25
ISSUED A PROCLAMATION ON THIS 

[Captioner] 19:25:25
ISSUE.

[Captioner] 19:25:27
I ENCOURAGE YOU NOT TO DO SO.

[Captioner] 19:25:30
EVERY PRESIDENT SINCE EISENHOWER 

[Captioner] 19:25:32
HAS FAILED TO ACHIEVE PEACE IN 

[Captioner] 19:25:32
THE MIDDLE EAST.

[Captioner] 19:25:35
THIS HAS NOT BEEN FROM A LACK OF 

[Captioner] 19:25:36
A STATEMENT FROM THE CITY OF 

[Captioner] 19:25:37
FREMONT.

[Captioner] 19:25:38
IT QUICKLY BECOMES APPARENT 

[Captioner] 19:25:39
THERE IS MORE THAN JUST A 

[Captioner] 19:25:40
DIFFERENCE OF OPINION GOING ON.

[Captioner] 19:25:41
THERE IS A FUNDAMENTALLY 

[Captioner] 19:25:43
DIFFERENT VIEW OF OBJECTIVE 

[Captioner] 19:25:45
REALITY AND ANY STATEMENT OF 

[Captioner] 19:25:48
PROCLAMATION YOU MAKE WILL ONLY 

[Captioner] 19:25:49
ADD TO THE NOISE.

[Captioner] 19:25:52
SOME SAY WHEN HAMAS, 

[Captioner] 19:25:53
INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNIZED 

[Captioner] 19:25:54
TERRORIST ORGANIZATION, LAUNCHED 

[Captioner] 19:25:56
A VICIOUS ATTACK ON ISRAEL.

[Captioner] 19:25:58
IT WAS AN ATTACK SO VIOLENT IT 

[Captioner] 19:25:59
ALMOST DEFIES DESCRIPTION.

[Captioner] 19:26:02
IN RESPONSE TO THE UNIMAGINABLE 

[Captioner] 19:26:04
BRUTALITY THAT HAMAS VISITS UPON 

[Captioner] 19:26:05
THEM, ISRAEL RESPONDED BY 

[Captioner] 19:26:07
LAUNCHING A MILITARY CAMPAIGN IN 

[Captioner] 19:26:08
GAZA BUT IT WAS NOT JUST A 

[Captioner] 19:26:09
RESPONSE TO THE HORRIFIC CRUELTY 

[Captioner] 19:26:10
OF THE OCTOBER 7TH ATTACKS.

[Captioner] 19:26:12
IT WAS A RESPONSE TO THE DECADES 

[Captioner] 19:26:14
OF ATTACKS THAT ISRAEL HAS 

[Captioner] 19:26:15
ENDURED FROM TERRORIST GROUPS 

[Captioner] 19:26:17
SUCH AS HAMAS, HEZBOLLAH, THE 

[Captioner] 19:26:18
PLO AND OTHERS AS WELL AS OTHER 

[Captioner] 19:26:19
COUNTRIES IN THE REGION.

[Captioner] 19:26:21
SEE, ISRAEL DECLARED 

[Captioner] 19:26:24
INDEPENDENCE ON MAY 14TH, 1948.

[Captioner] 19:26:27
THE NEXT DAY ON MAY 15TH, 1948, 

[Captioner] 19:26:28
THEY WERE ATTACKED BY FIVE OTHER 

[Captioner] 19:26:29
COUNTRIES.

[Captioner] 19:26:30
AND THEY HAVE BEEN FIGHTING FOR 

[Captioner] 19:26:31
THEIR EXISTENCE EVER SINCE.

[Captioner] 19:26:34
BUT EVEN THAT WASN'T THE 

[Captioner] 19:26:34
BEGINNING.

[Captioner] 19:26:36
THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST FOUGHT 

[Captioner] 19:26:37
OVER PIECES OF LAND ANYWHERE ON 

[Captioner] 19:26:37
EARTH.

[Captioner] 19:26:39
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN FIGHTING OVER 

[Captioner] 19:26:41
THIS AREA QUITE LITERALLY SINCE 

[Captioner] 19:26:42
THE VERY DAWN OF CIVILIZATION.

[Captioner] 19:26:44
SO WHY DOES THIS MATTER TO 

[Captioner] 19:26:45
FREMONT?

[Captioner] 19:26:46
IT MATTERS BECAUSE AS A RESULT 

[Captioner] 19:26:48
OF THESE EVENTS, WE ARE NOW 

[Captioner] 19:26:50
FACED WITH BOTH RISING 

[Captioner] 19:26:51
ANTISEMITISM AND RISING ISLAM 

[Captioner] 19:26:54
PHOBIA RIGHT HERE IN FREMONT AND 

[Captioner] 19:26:55
WE MUST NEVER TOLERATE THAT KIND 

[Captioner] 19:26:56
OF HATRED HERE IN THIS CITY.

[Captioner] 19:26:58
SO HERE IS MY ASK.

[Captioner] 19:27:00
DON'T ISSUE A PROCLAMATION ON 

[Captioner] 19:27:01
THIS CONFLICT OR IF YOU FEEL YOU 

[Captioner] 19:27:03
HAVE TO, DON'T TAKE SIDES.

[Captioner] 19:27:05
ANYTHING YOU SAY ONE WAY OR THE 

[Captioner] 19:27:07
OTHER WILL BE USED BY THE OTHER 

[Captioner] 19:27:07
SIDE.

[Captioner] 19:27:10
IF YOU MUST ISSUE A 

[Captioner] 19:27:11
PROCLAMATION, SIMPLY CALL FOR 

[Captioner] 19:27:13
LASTING PEACE, THAT IS FAIR TO ALL.

[Captioner] 19:27:15
NOW WHAT I WOULD LIKE YOU TO DO 

[Captioner] 19:27:16
IS ISSUE A PROCLAMATION STATING 

[Captioner] 19:27:18
THAT WE WILL NEVER TOLERATE 

[Captioner] 19:27:20
HATRED OR INJUSTICE OR RACISM 

[Captioner] 19:27:21
ANYWHERE HERE IN OUR CITY.

[Captioner] 19:27:23
FREMONT IS ONE OF THE MOST 

[Captioner] 19:27:24
DIVERSE CITIES ANYWHERE.

[Captioner] 19:27:27
WE ARE PROOF THAT PEOPLE OF ALL 

[Captioner] 19:27:28
DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS AND 

[Captioner] 19:27:30
RELIGIONS AND CULTURES CAN COME 

[Captioner] 19:27:30
TOGETHER AND BE ONE COMMUNITY.

[Captioner] 19:27:33
WE CAN BE FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS 

[Captioner] 19:27:35
AND LIVE TOGETHER IN PEACE AND 

[Captioner] 19:27:36
WE ARE ALL THE BETTER FOR THAT.

[Captioner] 19:27:38
AND THAT IS SOMETHING WORTH 

[Captioner] 19:27:38
PROCLAIMING.

[Captioner] 19:27:38
THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 19:27:44
[APPLAUSE]

[Captioner] 19:27:45
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 19:27:46
NEXT SPEAKER.

[Captioner] 19:27:49
>> Ms. Gauthier: SHREA FOLLOWED 

[Captioner] 19:27:50
BY SALIM.

[Captioner] 19:28:03
>> GOOD EVENING, HONORABLE 

[Captioner] 19:28:04
MEMBERS OF THE CITY COUNCIL AND 

[Captioner] 19:28:05
FELLOW RESIDENTS.

[Captioner] 19:28:07
I'M SHREA, I'M A STUDENT HERE AT 

[Captioner] 19:28:07
AMERICAN HIGH SCHOOL.

[Captioner] 19:28:10
I'M HERE TO ADDRESS A PRESSING 

[Captioner] 19:28:12
CONCERN THAT AFFECTS NOT JUST 

[Captioner] 19:28:13
OUR CITY BUT COMMUNITIES 

[Captioner] 19:28:13
ANYTHING'S WIDE.

[Captioner] 19:28:16
THE LACK OF YOUTH INVOLVEMENT IN 

[Captioner] 19:28:17
GOVERNMENT AND DECISION-MAKING.

[Captioner] 19:28:20
IT'S NO SECRET THAT OUR 

[Captioner] 19:28:22
GOVERNING BODIES JUST SEEM TO 

[Captioner] 19:28:23
HAVE MEMBERS THAT ARE A LOT 

[Captioner] 19:28:25
OLDER THAN OUR POPULATION, IN 

[Captioner] 19:28:29
FACT, THE SENATE'S MEDIAN AGES 

[Captioner] 19:28:32
ARE 58.4 AND 64.3 IN COMPARISON 

[Captioner] 19:28:34
TO AMERICA'S MEDIAN AGE, 38.9.

[Captioner] 19:28:36
THAT'S ALMOST A 20-YEAR GAP.

[Captioner] 19:28:38
WHILE I APPRECIATE THE DIVERSITY 

[Captioner] 19:28:41
IN FREMONT'S CURRENT COUNCIL, I 

[Captioner] 19:28:43
BELIEVE IT'S CRUCIAL TO BRIDGE 

[Captioner] 19:28:45
THE GENERATIONAL GAP AND INVITE 

[Captioner] 19:28:47
MORE YOUTH INTO THE FOLD OF 

[Captioner] 19:28:48
GOVERNANCE, ESPECIALLY HIGH 

[Captioner] 19:28:48
SCHOOLERS.

[Captioner] 19:28:52
I LOOKED INTO ALAMEDA'S

[Captioner] 19:28:53
 RECENT GENERAL ELECTION AND SAW 

[Captioner] 19:28:56
THAT WE HAD A 53.28 TURNOUT 

[Captioner] 19:28:57
RATE.

[Captioner] 19:29:00
THAT'S UNFORTUNATELY MIRRORS 

[Captioner] 19:29:01
AMERICA'S OVERALL TURNOUT RATE.

[Captioner] 19:29:02
AND I BELIEVE THE ONLY WAY TO 

[Captioner] 19:29:05
FIX IT IS BY ENCOURAGING YOUNGER 

[Captioner] 19:29:07
GENERATIONS TO VOTE AND ACTUALLY 

[Captioner] 19:29:08
FOLLOW THEIR CIVIC DUTY.

[Captioner] 19:29:13
THIS ACTUALLY IS A RESULT OF MY 

[Captioner] 19:29:15
OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCE.

[Captioner] 19:29:18
I TOOK A CLASS CALLED 

[Captioner] 19:29:19
ENTREPRENEURSHIP LAST YEAR AND 

[Captioner] 19:29:20
IT ENDED IN A CAPSTONE PROJECT 

[Captioner] 19:29:22
IN WHICH WE WERE ASKED TO 

[Captioner] 19:29:24
RESEARCH ABOUT THE HOMELESSNESS 

[Captioner] 19:29:27
IN CALIFORNIA, PARTICULARLY OUR 

[Captioner] 19:29:29
NEIGHBORS, SAN FRANCISCO AND 

[Captioner] 19:29:29
OAKLAND.

[Captioner] 19:29:32
IT WAS ONLY A MONTH BUT I SAW 

[Captioner] 19:29:33
STUDENTS WHO HAD NO INTEREST IN 

[Captioner] 19:29:34
GOVERNMENT BEFORE TAKE ACTION 

[Captioner] 19:29:37
AND RESEARCH POLICIES AND EVEN 

[Captioner] 19:29:40
CHALLENGE GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE 

[Captioner] 19:29:42
LIKE THEY TRULY INVOLVED 

[Captioner] 19:29:43
THEMSELVES IN THE SYSTEM AND I 

[Captioner] 19:29:44
BELIEVE IT'S AN EXPERIENCE THAT 

[Captioner] 19:29:45
ALL YOUNG PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE.

[Captioner] 19:29:52
AGAIN I IMPLORE THE CITY

[Captioner] 19:29:55
 TO -- NOT LECTURES BUT 

[Captioner] 19:29:57
SHADOWING PROGRAMS AND MOCK 

[Captioner] 19:29:58
TRIALS AND COUNCIL-ORGANIZED 

[Captioner] 19:30:00
FORUMS AND WORKSHOPS THAT ALLOW 

[Captioner] 19:30:03
THEM TO SEE HOW THEIR DECISIONS 

[Captioner] 19:30:04
AFFECT THE CITY THEY LIVE IN SO 

[Captioner] 19:30:07
THAT THEY'LL TAKE ACTIONS THAT 

[Captioner] 19:30:08
AFFECT THE WORLD THEY LIVE IN IN 

[Captioner] 19:30:08
THE FUTURE.

[Captioner] 19:30:09
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.

[Captioner] 19:30:11
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 19:30:11
[APPLAUSE]

[Captioner] 19:30:13
>> Ms. Gauthier: THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 19:30:15
SALIM IS THE LAST SPEAKER.

[Captioner] 19:30:20
>> Mayor Mei: WELCOME.

[Captioner] 19:30:26
>> GOOD EVENING, MAYOR, 

[Captioner] 19:30:26
COUNCILMEMBERS AND THE STAFF.

[Captioner] 19:30:29
THE GENTLEMAN SPOKE ABOUT THE 

[Captioner] 19:30:29
WAR IN THE MIDDLE EAST.

[Captioner] 19:30:38
THEY CAN KILL ALL THE KIDS, ONE

[Captioner] 19:30:39
 MOSES STILL REMAIN STANDING.

[Captioner] 19:30:42
IT IS NOT KILLING PEOPLE BUT 

[Captioner] 19:30:46
LOVING PEOPLE THAT WILL MAKE THE 

[Captioner] 19:30:46
DIFFERENCE.

[Captioner] 19:30:49
I DIDN'T WANT TO SPEAK ABOUT IT, 

[Captioner] 19:30:53
BUT SINCE HE WAS SO ELOQUENT IN

[Captioner] 19:30:57
 GIVING ONE SIDE OF THE PICTURE, 

[Captioner] 19:30:58
I THINK AN OPEN DEBATE AND A 

[Captioner] 19:31:00
DATE SHOULD BE SET WHERE PEOPLE 

[Captioner] 19:31:02
CAN COME IN AND GIVE THEIR OWN 

[Captioner] 19:31:02
OPINIONS.

[Captioner] 19:31:04
SO HAVING SAID THAT, I WOULD 

[Captioner] 19:31:05
LIKE TO MOVE ON.

[Captioner] 19:31:08
WE ARE EQUALLY CONCERNED FOR 

[Captioner] 19:31:12
EVERYBODY IN ISRAEL AND 

[Captioner] 19:31:12
PALESTINE.

[Captioner] 19:31:14
KILLING PEOPLE IS NEVER THE 

[Captioner] 19:31:16
SOLUTION, IT NEVER HAS BEEN, IT 

[Captioner] 19:31:19
NEVER WILL BE.

[Captioner] 19:31:23
PEACE COMES WITH LOVE AND BIG 

[Captioner] 19:31:27
HEARTEDNESS AND

[Captioner] 19:31:29
 GIVING, NOT RECEIVING.

[Captioner] 19:31:29
THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 19:31:32
I WOULD LIKE TO HONOR DR. HARRY EDWARDS.

[Captioner] 19:31:32

[Captioner] 19:36:49
DISTRICT BOARD OF EDUCATION, 

[Captioner] 19:36:51
SUPERINTENDENT AND CITY 

[Captioner] 19:36:51
MANAGER.

[Captioner] 19:36:53
WE WERE AT THE MEETING.

[Captioner] 19:36:54
AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WAS 

[Captioner] 19:36:57
ON OUR AGENDA WAS TO REALLY -- 

[Captioner] 19:36:59
TO PRIORITIZE OUR ACTIONS FOR 

[Captioner] 19:37:02
THE COMING YEAR, AND WE CAME UP 

[Captioner] 19:37:04
WITH THREE MAJOR PRIORITIES.

[Captioner] 19:37:06
ONE WOULD BE A CAREER FAIR.

[Captioner] 19:37:08
AT THIS CAREER FAIR, WE WOULD 

[Captioner] 19:37:10
LOOK AT INTERNSHIPS, 

[Captioner] 19:37:12
PARTNERSHIPS WITH THE FREMONT 

[Captioner] 19:37:14
CHAMBER OF COMMERCE, WE WOULD 

[Captioner] 19:37:15
LOOK AT DIFFERENT CAREERS IN THE 

[Captioner] 19:37:17
MEDICAL FIELD, POLICE, FIRE, 

[Captioner] 19:37:21
NURSING, TEACHING, ENVIRONMENTAL 

[Captioner] 19:37:22
IMPACT, ARBORISTS.

[Captioner] 19:37:25
THAT WAS ONE OF MY ASKS, SINCE 

[Captioner] 19:37:26
WE'VE ALREADY -- ARE ALWAYS 

[Captioner] 19:37:28
LOOKING FOR AN ARBORIST, WE 

[Captioner] 19:37:29
WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE 

[Captioner] 19:37:31
WAS CAREER OPPORTUNITIES AT THE 

[Captioner] 19:37:31
CAREER FAIR FOR THAT.

[Captioner] 19:37:36
WE WANTED TO ALSO HAVE THAT 

[Captioner] 19:37:38
CAREER FAIR IN THE SPRING OF 

[Captioner] 19:37:39
2024.

[Captioner] 19:37:42
WE ALSO TALKED ABOUT BEHAVIORAL 

[Captioner] 19:37:43
COUNSELORS AS BEING A PART OF 

[Captioner] 19:37:45
THE CAREER FAIR THAT DAY AS 

[Captioner] 19:37:45
WELL.

[Captioner] 19:37:47
SECOND PRIORITY WOULD CONTINUE 

[Captioner] 19:37:49
TO BE OUR WALK AND ROLL TO 

[Captioner] 19:37:50
SCHOOL ACTIVITY THAT WE 

[Captioner] 19:37:52
CURRENTLY DO WITH THE COUNTY, 

[Captioner] 19:37:53
AND THEN THE THIRD PRIORITY 

[Captioner] 19:37:56
WOULD BE OUR UNSHELTERED 

[Captioner] 19:37:59
FAMILIES, BOTH THE STUDENTS THAT 

[Captioner] 19:38:03
ARE PART OF THE

[Captioner] 19:38:04
 MCKINNEY-VENTO PROJECT WITH THE 

[Captioner] 19:38:06
SCHOOL DISTRICT, AS WELL AS OUR 

[Captioner] 19:38:09
PARTNERSHIP WITH THE CITY TO 

[Captioner] 19:38:10
CONTINUE TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT 

[Captioner] 19:38:12
OF HOMELESSNESS IN OUR 

[Captioner] 19:38:12
COMMUNITY.

[Captioner] 19:38:16
WE ALSO TALKED ABOUT NOT JUST 

[Captioner] 19:38:19
DOING SOMETHING FOR UNSHELTERED 

[Captioner] 19:38:21
FAMILIES DURING THE HOLIDAYS, 

[Captioner] 19:38:23
BUT TO THINK ABOUT SOMETHING 

[Captioner] 19:38:25
CONSISTENTLY, LIKE MAYBE A BOOK 

[Captioner] 19:38:28
DRIVE TO HELP KIDS LEARN HOW TO 

[Captioner] 19:38:29
READ, GREATER PARTNERSHIP WITH 

[Captioner] 19:38:31
OUR MANUFACTURING DAY.

[Captioner] 19:38:33
I KNOW ONE OF THE CONCERNS WAS 

[Captioner] 19:38:35
THAT THE MANUFACTURING DAY WAS 

[Captioner] 19:38:37
DONE EARLY IN THE SCHOOL YEAR, 

[Captioner] 19:38:39
AND THEY WANTED TO SEE HOW THEY 

[Captioner] 19:38:43
MIGHT BE ABLE TO GET HIGH SCHOOL 

[Captioner] 19:38:45
TEACHERS TO SUPPORT THE 

[Captioner] 19:38:48
MANUFACTURING DAY, GIVEN IT WAS 

[Captioner] 19:38:53
SO SOON BEFORE SCHOOL GOT 

[Captioner] 19:38:53
STARTED.

[Captioner] 19:38:54
THE LAST THING, PLEASE, 

[Captioner] 19:38:56
COUNCILMEMBER KENG, IF I MISS 

[Captioner] 19:39:01
ANYTHING,

[Captioner] 19:39:01
 PLEASE REMIND ME.

[Captioner] 19:39:03
ONE OF THE THINGS WE ALSO WANTED 

[Captioner] 19:39:04
TO DO, BECAUSE WE HAVE THREE 

[Captioner] 19:39:06
MAIN AREAS, THE CITY 

[Captioner] 19:39:07
COUNCILMEMBERS AND THE SCHOOL 

[Captioner] 19:39:09
BOARD MEMBERS TO SELECT ONE OF 

[Captioner] 19:39:13
THE PRIORITIES AND SORT OF HELP 

[Captioner] 19:39:14
RUN THAT OR PROVIDE SOME 

[Captioner] 19:39:15
LEADERSHIP TO THAT.

[Captioner] 19:39:17
SO THAT THERE WAS SOME 

[Captioner] 19:39:17
ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THE WORK THAT 

[Captioner] 19:39:21
WE WERE DOING TOGETHER JOINTLY 

[Captioner] 19:39:22
WITH THE SCHOOL BOARD.

[Captioner] 19:39:24
COUNCILMEMBER KENG, DID I MISS 

[Captioner] 19:39:24
ANYTHING?

[Captioner] 19:39:26
>> Mayor Mei: COUNCILMEMBER 

[Captioner] 19:39:27
KENG, WOULD YOU LIKE TO ADD 

[Captioner] 19:39:27
ANYTHING?

[Captioner] 19:39:27
>> Councilmember Keng: THANK YOU 

[Captioner] 19:39:29
VERY MUCH, COUNCILMEMBER 

[Captioner] 19:39:30
CAMPBELL, AND I WOULD LIKE TO 

[Captioner] 19:39:34
ADD THAT IN THE SECOND PRIORITY, 

[Captioner] 19:39:35
IT ALSO INCLUDED INCREASING AND 

[Captioner] 19:39:37
CONTINUING THE MENTAL HEALTH 

[Captioner] 19:39:38
SERVICES AND SUPPORT FOR OUR 

[Captioner] 19:39:38
STUDENTS.

[Captioner] 19:39:43
AND FOR THE

[Captioner] 19:39:46
 COUNCILMEMBERS AND -- IT'S FOR 

[Captioner] 19:39:50
THE LIAISON COMMITTEE TO KIND OF 

[Captioner] 19:39:52
TAKE LEADERSHIP IN ONE OF THE 

[Captioner] 19:39:54
THREE PROGRAMS THAT WE ARE 

[Captioner] 19:39:56
LOOKING TO FOCUS ON, AND SO THAT 

[Captioner] 19:39:59
WE CAN KIND OF SPEARHEAD THOSE 

[Captioner] 19:40:02
THREE PRIORITIES AND REPORT TO 

[Captioner] 19:40:03
THE LARGER GROUP.

[Captioner] 19:40:04
THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 19:40:06
AND SO OUR NEXT MEETING -- THE 

[Captioner] 19:40:07
NEXT LIAISON COMMITTEE MEETING 

[Captioner] 19:40:09
WILL BE IN JANUARY, BEFORE OUR 

[Captioner] 19:40:13
FEBRUARY MEETING.

[Captioner] 19:40:14
>> Councilmember Campbell: YES.

[Captioner] 19:40:15
ONE OF THE THINGS WE DID TALK 

[Captioner] 19:40:17
ABOUT, I REMEMBER WHEN YOU SAID 

[Captioner] 19:40:18
THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PIECE, WE 

[Captioner] 19:40:20
REALLY WANTED TO SHINE A LIGHT 

[Captioner] 19:40:24
ON STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES, 

[Captioner] 19:40:27
AND ALSO WAYS IN WHICH WE CAN 

[Captioner] 19:40:29
SUPPORT THEM AND WORK TOWARDS 

[Captioner] 19:40:31
ENSURING THAT THEY'RE NOT 

[Captioner] 19:40:37
ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY EXPULSIONS 

[Captioner] 19:40:40
AND SO WE WERE GOING TO HAVE A 

[Captioner] 19:40:42
SUBSET OF THAT IN OUR SORT OF 

[Captioner] 19:40:43
UNSHELTERED REPORTS, THAT THE 

[Captioner] 19:40:44
SCHOOL DISTRICT WILL BE SENDING 

[Captioner] 19:40:44
TO US.

[Captioner] 19:40:49
>> Mayor Mei: GREAT.

[Captioner] 19:40:50

[Captioner] 19:40:52
I THINK THERE'S PLENTY OF TIME, 

[Captioner] 19:40:53

[Captioner] 19:40:56
I THINK IT'S OUR SEVENTH YEAR 

[Captioner] 19:40:58

WE'VE HAD A STUDENT ART CONTEST 

[Captioner] 19:41:03
IN PARTICULAR FOE KUTION ON 

[Captioner] 19:41:04

[Captioner] 19:41:06

[Captioner] 19:41:07
MESSAGING, WHETHER IT'S THROUGH 

[Captioner] 19:41:10

[Captioner] 19:41:11

HOPEFULLY SHARING SOME MORE GOOD 

[Captioner] 19:42:22
NEWS TO COME TOO.

[Captioner] 19:42:26
I JUST RETURNED

[Captioner] 19:42:29
 YESTERDAY AFTER -- LATE 

[Captioner] 19:42:33
AFTERNOON FROM DUBAI, SO I WAS A

[Captioner] 19:42:38
 PARTICIPANT AT COMPS 28, I

[Captioner] 19:42:41
 WAS A SPEAKER FOR US FOR U.S. 

[Captioner] 19:42:42
CONFERENCE OF MAYORS SO I'M 

[Captioner] 19:42:43
HONORED TO BE ABLE TO REPRESENT 

[Captioner] 19:42:43
OUR COMMUNITY.

[Captioner] 19:42:48
I WAS ONE OF TWO MAYORS FROM

[Captioner] 19:42:49
 CALIFORNIA AND TO FOCUS ON 

[Captioner] 19:42:51
SPECIFICALLY WE TALKED EARLIER 

[Captioner] 19:42:54
ABOUT HOW WE ARE A TREE-FRIENDLY 

[Captioner] 19:42:55
CITY, AND SO IT IS A GREAT 

[Captioner] 19:42:58
PRIVILEGE TO SEE THAT FREMONT 

[Captioner] 19:43:00
CONTINUES TO BE RECOGNIZED IN 

[Captioner] 19:43:04
ITS LEADERSHIP WITHIN THE

[Captioner] 19:43:06
 ENVIRONMENT AND ONE OF THE 

[Captioner] 19:43:07
THINGS WE'VE ALSO COMMITTED TO, 

[Captioner] 19:43:08
AND I HAVE TO THANK ALL THE 

[Captioner] 19:43:09
COUNCILMEMBERS FOR YOUR SUPPORT, 

[Captioner] 19:43:11
IS UPDATING OUR CLIMATE ACTION 

[Captioner] 19:43:11
PLAN.

[Captioner] 19:43:15
AND IN PARTICULAR, I SPOKE

[Captioner] 19:43:18
 FOR THE AMERICA'S ALL IN 

[Captioner] 19:43:21
DISCUSSION TO REPRESENT US AND 

[Captioner] 19:43:22
HAD SOME REALLY GOOD 

[Captioner] 19:43:23
CONVERSATIONS WITH SOME OF OUR 

[Captioner] 19:43:25
OTHER SECRETARIES WHO I HOPE TO 

[Captioner] 19:43:26
BE ABLE TO INCLUDE.

[Captioner] 19:43:28
BUT THE KEY PIECE I ALSO WANTED 

[Captioner] 19:43:29
TO MENTION, BECAUSE I SEE THE 

[Captioner] 19:43:31
STUDENTS IN THE AUDIENCE, IS 

[Captioner] 19:43:33
THAT I WILL BE COMING -- 

[Captioner] 19:43:35
FORTHCOMING SOON WITH ADDITIONAL 

[Captioner] 19:43:37
DETAILS, BUT I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO 

[Captioner] 19:43:38
SECURE SPECIFICALLY ONE OF THE 

[Captioner] 19:43:40
SESSIONS WAS ABOUT YOUTH 

[Captioner] 19:43:41
ENGAGEMENT FOR CLIMATE ACTION.

[Captioner] 19:43:45
AND SO I AM GOING TO SECURE A 

[Captioner] 19:43:47
POOL OF FUNDING, AND I DON'T 

[Captioner] 19:43:48
WANT TO FINALIZE IT UNTIL I HAVE 

[Captioner] 19:43:50
ALL THE DETAILS, BUT I'M VERY 

[Captioner] 19:43:51
HAPPY TO SEE THAT THIS IS AN 

[Captioner] 19:43:52
EXCELLENT OPPORTUNITY, AND I 

[Captioner] 19:43:53
WANT YOU TO BE ENGAGED.

[Captioner] 19:43:56
I KNOW SO OFTEN AS A CITY, WE 

[Captioner] 19:43:58
HAVE MANY ACTIVITIES AND I SAW 

[Captioner] 19:44:00
EARLIER WE HAD OUR PARKS AND 

[Captioner] 19:44:01
RECREATION COMMISSION -- OR 

[Captioner] 19:44:03
COMMITTEE AND LEADERSHIP STAFF 

[Captioner] 19:44:05
THAT WAS HERE, AND SO WE'VE BEEN 

[Captioner] 19:44:06
VERY STRONG IN THOSE AREAS.

[Captioner] 19:44:08
BUT MANY OF THE ISSUES THAT 

[Captioner] 19:44:09
YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT, AND I'VE 

[Captioner] 19:44:11
SEEN THIS IN THE SCHOOLS, 

[Captioner] 19:44:12
WHETHER IT'S WITH OUR EAGLES AT 

[Captioner] 19:44:16
AMERICAN HIGH OR AT IRVINGTON 

[Captioner] 19:44:18
WITH THE QUEST AND CHANGE 

[Captioner] 19:44:20
PROJECT, MANY OF US OVER THE 

[Captioner] 19:44:21
YEARS HAVE HAD THE PLEASURE OF 

[Captioner] 19:44:24
WORKING WITH OUR STUDENTS WITH 

[Captioner] 19:44:27
SURF BOARD E, OWELY KNEE 

[Captioner] 19:44:27
COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS, WHEN 

[Captioner] 19:44:29
YOU TALK ABOUT INCLUSIVENESS, 

[Captioner] 19:44:30
THE SCHOOL FOR THE DEAF AND ALSO 

[Captioner] 19:44:32
WE'RE THE ONLY STATE-RUN SCHOOL 

[Captioner] 19:44:33
FOR THE BLIND SIT IN FREMONT.

[Captioner] 19:44:35
SO I THINK THAT THERE'S SOME 

[Captioner] 19:44:35
GOOD OPPORTUNITIES.

[Captioner] 19:44:36
BUT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT, SO 

[Captioner] 19:44:37
PLEASE LOOK FOR DETAILTS.

[Captioner] 19:44:40
THEY'LL BE COMING IN THE NEAR 

[Captioner] 19:44:41
FUTURE, BECAUSE IT'S AN 

[Captioner] 19:44:42
AGGRESSIVE TIMELINE AND IT'S 

[Captioner] 19:44:43
IMPORTANT THAT WE DO WELL IN 

[Captioner] 19:44:45
THIS TIMELINE BECAUSE IF WE DO 

[Captioner] 19:44:46
WELL WITH THE FUNDING THAT'S 

[Captioner] 19:44:48
PROVIDED IN THE FIRST ROUND, I 

[Captioner] 19:44:50
WILL HAVE SECURED DOUBLE THAT 

[Captioner] 19:44:51
FOR THE SECOND ROUND.

[Captioner] 19:44:53
AND IT'S ALL WITHIN THIS NEXT 

[Captioner] 19:44:53
YEAR.

[Captioner] 19:44:55
SO I'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD -- 

[Captioner] 19:44:57
THIS IS AN EXCELLENT OPPORTUNITY 

[Captioner] 19:44:59
FOR YOU AS THE YOUTH, WHETHER 

[Captioner] 19:45:02
YOU'RE IN OUR HIGH SCHOOLS OR 

[Captioner] 19:45:04
OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES, I'M 

[Captioner] 19:45:08
CALLING OUT ON YOU TO NOT JUST 

[Captioner] 19:45:09
TALK ABOUT IT, BUT LET'S DO 

[Captioner] 19:45:10
SOMETHING TOGETHER.

[Captioner] 19:45:12
I THINK THAT'S AN EXCELLENT 

[Captioner] 19:45:13
OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO MAKE THAT 

[Captioner] 19:45:13
DIFFERENCE.

[Captioner] 19:45:15
SO WITH THAT, I ALSO WANT TO 

[Captioner] 19:45:17
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT AT THIS MOMENT, 

[Captioner] 19:45:19
I'M GOING TO ASK FOR A MOMENT OF 

[Captioner] 19:45:21
SILENCE AS WE ADJOURN BECAUSE 

[Captioner] 19:45:22
THERE ARE JUST SO MANY REASONS 

[Captioner] 19:45:24
RIGHT NOW IN THIS WORLD, THE ONE 

[Captioner] 19:45:25
THING I WOULD DEFINITELY AGREE 

[Captioner] 19:45:27
WITH THE SPEAKER ON IS I THINK 

[Captioner] 19:45:29
WE CAN ALL ACKNOWLEDGE THE NEED 

[Captioner] 19:45:30
FOR PEACE AND BEING KIND.

[Captioner] 19:45:31
SO I'M GOING TO ASK FOR A MOMENT 

[Captioner] 19:45:32
OF SILENCE.

[Captioner] 19:45:50
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THIS.

[Captioner] 19:45:52
I'D ASK THAT YOU BE WELL, TO BE 

[Captioner] 19:45:54
SAFE, TO BE JUST AND TO BE KIND, 

[Captioner] 19:45:55
AND IF YOU'VE NEVER HAD A 

[Captioner] 19:45:57
CHANCE, IF YOU'RE DRIVING ALONG 

[Captioner] 19:45:58
PASEO PADRE, THERE'S A GROVE OF 

[Captioner] 19:46:00
TREES THAT WE PLANTED DURING THE 

[Captioner] 19:46:02
PANDEMIC TO HONOR THOSE WHOSE 

[Captioner] 19:46:03
LIVES WE LOST, AND SO THOSE ARE 

[Captioner] 19:46:04
JUST SOME OF THE MANY WAYS THAT 

[Captioner] 19:46:06
WE CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE, BUT WE 

[Captioner] 19:46:08
ARE VERY EXCITED AND GLAD TO 

[Captioner] 19:46:09
HAVE STUDENTS COMING EVERY WEEK 

[Captioner] 19:46:11
NOW, IT SEEMS LIKE, TO OUR 

[Captioner] 19:46:11
