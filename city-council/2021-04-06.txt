SORRY, SAY AGAIN.

>> Ms. Gauthier: THERE'S NO OTHER 
19:05:36 SPEAKERS RAISING THEIR HANDS.

>> Mayor Mei: THE MOTION PASSES FOR 
19:06:28 THE CONSENT CALENDAR EXCLUDING THOSE ITEMS UNANIMOUSLY.
NEXT ON OUR LIST TONIGHT IS A 
19:06:38 PROCLAMATION THAT'S BEING PRESENTED BY SUPERVISOR HAUBERT, AND I THINK KATHY KIMBERLIN IS HERE TO PRESENT THE 
19:06:42 PROCLAMATION ON BEHALF OF US FOR RECOGNITION FOR THE HAPPIEST CITY IN  AMERICA.

19:06:51 WELL COME, MS. KIMBERLIN.
SORRY, APOLOGIES, YOU'RE ON  MUTE.
>> GOOD EVENING, EVERYONE.

19:06:58 KATHY KIMBERLIN HERE REPRESENTING SUPERVISOR  HAUBERT'S OFFICE.
I'M HIS ASSISTANT AND FIELD DIRECTOR 
19:07:04 FOR FREMONT, AND HELP OUT WITH OTHER PLACES AS NEEDED.
I'M SORRY HE COULDN'T BE WITH YOU HERE 
19:07:11 TONIGHT BUT HE FOUND IT VERY IMPORTANT TO LET YOU KNOW HOW PROUD HE IS THAT FREMONT HAS THE STATUS OF THE HAPPIEST 
19:07:17 CITY IN AMERICA.
AND HIS COMMENDATION SAYS THAT IN RECOGNITION OF THE CITY OF FREMONT FOR 
19:07:24 BEING THE HAPPIEST CITY IN AMERICA, YOUR LEGACY FOR RANKING NUMBER ONE FOR EMOTIONAL AND PHYSICAL WELL-BEING IS 
19:07:32 CHERISHED BY OUR COMMUNITY.
IT'S WITH GREAT HONOR THAT ALAMEDA COUNCIL TEAL SUPERVISOR DAVID HAUBERT 
19:07:37 DOES HEREBY COMMEND THE CITY OF FREMONT FOR ITS MANY CONTRIBUTIONS TOWARD IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR THE 
19:07:45 COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND POSITIVELY IMPACTING THE FREMONT COMMUNITY.
AND A LITTLE BIT MORE FROM SUPERVISOR 
19:07:51 HAUBERT.
HE RECOGNIZES THAT THE PLACES THAT HE REPRESENTS, LIVERMORE, DUBLIN, FREMONT 
19:07:58 AND SOME UNINCORPORATED AREAS, LIVERMORE MIGHT HAVE SOME FABULOUS  WINERIES, DUBLIN IS A GREAT LOCATION 
19:08:05 KNOWN AS A CROSSROADS TO THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA, AND IN 2018 WAS CHOSEN THE BEST PLACE TO LIVE.

19:08:16 BUT FREMONT, DURING A PANDEMIC, WAS VOTED THE HAPPIEST CITY IN AMERICA.
AND THAT IS BASED ON 31 KEY INDICATORS 
19:08:23 BY WALLET HUB AND SOME OF THOSE GREAT KEY INDICATORS WHICH I THINK ARE VERY MEANINGFUL ARE JOB SATISFACTION, 
19:08:32 POSITIVE MENTAL STATE, HEALTHY BODY, STRONG SOCIAL CONNECTIONS.
AND SUPERVISOR HAUBERT IS VERY, VERY 
19:08:37 EXCITED FOR THE CITY OF FREMONT AND LOOKS FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE CITY OF FREMONT FOR YEARS TO COME.

19:08:42 THANK YOU.
CONGRATULATIONS.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU FOR THIS 
19:08:47 RECOGNITION.
WE APPRECIATE THAT.
AND SO THANK YOU TO THE COMMUNITY 
19:08:52 MEMBERS AND OUR STAFF AND SO MANY OF THE BUSINESSES WHO HAVE CHOSEN TO MAKE FREMONT HOME AND MAKE THIS A SPECIAL 
19:08:59 PLACE.
PLEASE EXPRESS OUR APPRECIATION TO SUPERVISOR HAUBERT AND TO YOUR TEAM.

19:09:05 NEXT IS ORAL COMMUNICATIONS.
THOSE ARE ITEMS THAT ARE NOT SCHEDULED FOR TONIGHT'S AGENDA.

19:09:17 AND SO IF WE CAN CALL THOSE SPEAKERS.
I SEE AT LEAST ONE, SONIA KHAN.
AND EACH SPEAKER HAS -- I'M LOOKING 
19:09:23 FOR THE CLOCK.
THREE MINUTES PER SPEAKER IS WHAT WE HAVE.

19:09:28 YES.
>> THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR.
SONIA HAHN, HRC SPEAKING FOR MYSELF 
19:09:32 TONIGHT.
TIMES ARE TURBULENT INDEED.
THINGS ARE CHANGING RAPIDLY.

19:09:39 PEOPLE ARE BEING FORCED TO CONFRONT HOW THEY FEEL ABOUT SO MANY ISSUES THAT ONCE UPON A TIME WE COULD SAFELY PUT 
19:09:44 OFF INDEFINITELY WITHOUT IMPACT ON OUR OWN LIVES BUT NOW IT SEEMS LIKE WE'RE ALL IMPACTED.

19:09:47 TO GREATER OR LESSER EXTENT WE CAN NO LONGER AVOID DEALING WITH THESE ISSUES.

19:09:52 I NEED TONIGHT TO MAKE THE CASE TO THE CITY OF FREMONT THAT RACISM IS ALSO ONE OF THOSE ISSUES THAT IMPACT US 
19:09:56 ALL.
AND THAT'S A DIFFICULT CASE TO MAKE IF NOT EVERYBODY IS IN AGREEMENT ABOUT 
19:10:01 THE BASIC FACTS THAT LED UP TO THIS MOMENT.
I PLAN TO SPEND A BIT OF TIME DROPPING 
19:10:05 SOME OF THOSE FACTS FROM TIME TO TIME RIGHT HERE IN THIS PUBLIC COMMENT IF YOU WILL PERMIT ME.

19:10:12 FACT, THE SUBJECT OF SYSTEMIC RACISM IS NOT CONTRARY TO POPULAR BELIEF ABOUT HOW WE ALL GET ALONG IN OUR 
19:10:19 COMMUNITIES WITH ONE ANOTHER.
THAT IS THE SUBJECT OF HUMAN RELATIONS AND GROUP DYNAMICS AND IT'S A SOCIAL 
19:10:23 YOLG BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE FIELD.
SYSTEMIC RACISM --
>> CAN YOU HEAR ME?

19:10:30 >> HELLO?
IS STE MIC RACISM IS A EVIDENCE-BASED MEASUREMENT OF PARAMETERS THAT CAN 
19:10:36 CLEARLY DEMONSTRATE THERE'S A SYSTEM OF LAWS, REGULATIONS AND CODES THAT BOTH DIRECTLY AND INDIRECTLY DISCRIMINATE 
19:10:43 AGAINST CERTAIN POPULATIONS WITHOUT ANY SINGLE PERSON HAVING TO MAKE A BIGOTED DECISION IN THEIR OWN RITE.

19:10:52 IT CAN BE FOUND IN SEVERAL SECTORS, INDUSTRIES AND INSTITUTIONS.
WE'VE BEEN SPENDING A GREAT DEAL OF 
19:11:01 TIME TALKING ABOUT POLICING BUT I WANT TO OFFER -- ANOTHER ONE OF THE INSTITUTIONAL PILLARS THAT'S REAPED SO 
19:11:08 MUCH HARM ON A SOCIETAL LEVEL.
LET US TAKE FOR EXAMPLE DIABETIC FOOT AMPUTATIONS THIS IS A KNOWN TRAGIC OUT 
19:11:14 COME PATIENT CAN ENCOUNTER AFTER LONG YEARS OF FIGHTING THIS DISEASE AND IT DOES INDEED HAPPEN TO PATIENTS OF ALL 
19:11:20 RACES IN AMERICA BUT IF YOU EXAMINE THE DEMOGRAPHIC DATA MORE CLOSELY YOU CAN SEE VERY QUICKLY THAT A 
19:11:25 DISPROPORTIONATE PERCENTAGE WHO WILL HAVE THIS OUTCOME WILL BE BLACK PATIENTS AND AT AN EARLIER AGE AND 
19:11:32 WITH FEWER YEARS SPENT AS A DIABETIC.
AND THERE IS NO PREDISPOSING GENETIC TEMPERAMENT FOR THIS SO WHY WAS IT 
19:11:36 HAPPENING?
IT TURNS OUT IF YOU PLOT THE GEOGRAPHIC ZIP CODE OF ALL THESE 
19:11:42 PATIENTS ON A MAP YOU WILL FIND THAT IT TRANSPOSES ALMOST PERFECTLY ON TOP OF THE MAP OF RED LINE DISTRICTS WHERE 
19:11:48 HOUSING DISCRIMINATION HAS MANAGED TO CONCENTRATE AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITIES WHO JUST HAPPEN AND NOT BY 
19:11:53 ACCIDENT NOT TO HAVE ANY NEARBY CENTERS OF EXCELLENCE WITH THAT NEW VASCULARIZATION PROCEDURE THAT'S 
19:12:01 NEEDED TO SAVE THOSE FEET.
OR THE TRANSPORT TO GET TO THE CENTERS THAT ARE FAR AWAY, AND TIME IS OF THE 
19:12:35 ESSENCE FOR GANGRENOUS LIMBS AND EVEN IF THEY COULD GET THERE THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE RIGHT KIND OF HEALTH 
19:12:41 INSURANCE ANYWAY IF THEY HAVE INSURANCE AT ALL.
NOT 1BIGOFED RACIST MADE THOSE 
19:12:48 DECISIONS BUT WE ALL TURNED A BLIND EYE AND LET IT CONTINUE TO HAPPEN AND THAT IS SYSTEMIC RACISM AS A PUBLIC HEALTH 
19:12:54 PROBLEM.
THANK YOU FOR LISTENING TO TODAY'S INSTALLMENT OF "IT'S RACISM, PEOPLE."

19:13:03 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
NEXT SPEAKER IS BLAIR BEEKMAN.
>> HI.

19:13:12 HAD A FEW ISSUES OF CONCERN.
I NOTICED THE FREMONT UNION SCHOOL DISTRICT HAS SCRAPPED THE ENTIRE 
19:13:17 SCHOOL YEAR AT THIS TIME AND WILL BE STARTING AGAIN IN THE FALL.
I THOUGHT IT WAS AN INTERESTING 
19:13:23 DECISION.
I KNOW -- I FEEL THE FUSD BOARD PERSONS HAVE A REAL CARE FOR THE 
19:13:31 SAFETY AND HEALTH OF HOW THE PROCESS GOES FORWARD.
IT'S MY PERSONAL FEELING THAT THERE 
19:13:41 WAS CERTAIN DEMANDS ABOUT THE TECHNOLOGY ISSUES AND THAT COMBINATION ALONG WITH WHAT WILL BE A SLIGHT 
19:13:47 POSSIBLE RISE IN COVID AT THIS TIME THAT'S  HAPPENING.
YOU KNOW, THAT COMBINATION OF THINGS 
19:13:59 JUST LED THEM TO BE SAFE AND NOT SORRY, AND I ASK THE COMMUNITY TO CONSIDER THAT AND TO CONSIDER THAT IN ALL THE 
19:14:07 DEBATING OVER THESE MONTHS, I HOPE YOU'VE NOTICED THE REAL CARE AND SENSITIVITY THAT FUSD BOARD MEMBERS 
19:14:13 HAVE TRIED TO HAVE FOR THIS ISSUE AND TO NOT GO TOO HARD ON THEM IF YOU CAN BECAUSE THEY HAVE A REAL CARE FOR 
19:14:20 PEOPLE NOT TO BE HURT OUT OF THIS SITUATION.
AND SO GOOD LUCK ON HOW YOU CONTINUE 
19:14:31 TO WORK ON THIS ISSUE.
I ALSO NOTICED THAT THE POLICE CHIEF IS RETIRING, KIMBERLY PETERSEN, AFTER 
19:14:40 25 YEARS.
SO I GUESS I'VE BEEN OKAY WITH THAT.
I'VE BEEN LEARNING I CAN ACTUALLY ASK 
19:14:45 THE QUESTION, SHOULD THERE BE SOME SORT OF COMMUNITY PROCESS TO INTRODUCE THE NEW POLICE CHIEF?

19:14:52 CAN WE GET ACQUAINTED, CAN WE UNDERSTAND THE DECISION-MAKING WHY THIS IS ALL HAPPENED?

19:15:01 AND I KNOW YOU HAVE COMMUNITY PUBLIC MEETINGS WITH THE POLICE, SAY BACK IN LATE MARCH AND YOU'LL BE HAVING ONE 
19:15:06 UPCOMING VERY SOON, SO THAT IS GOOD THAT YOU DO HAVE A COMMUNITY POLICE FORUM, POLICE COMMUNITY FORUM.

19:15:15 I HOPE THOSE QUESTIONS CAN BE ASKED AND IT CAN BE A PART OF A PROCESS TO ASK EXACTLY WHAT HAS HAPPENED AND WHAT CAN 
19:15:22 WE EXPECT AND WHAT CAN WE SEE FROM THE NEW CHIEF TO UNDERSTAND HIS POSITION ON THINGS.

19:15:27 ALL THAT IS IMPORTANT, AND I HOPE YOU CAN LEARN HOW TO MAKE IT AN OPEN PUBLIC PROCESS AT THIS TIME.

19:15:33 I THINK THAT HAS TO BE REALLY CONSIDERED, YOU CAN'T JUST SILENTLY OFFER THESE THINGS, HOPEFULLY YOU CAN 
19:15:40 LEARN HOW TO, AS WE GO, MAKE AN OPEN PUBLIC PROCESS FOR US TO UNDERSTAND.
THANK YOU.

19:15:52 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
IS THAT THE LAST PUBLIC SPEAKER FOR ORAL COMMUNICATIONS.

19:15:56 SO NOW WE'RE GOING TO RETURN TO THE ITEMS PULLED FROM THE CONSENT CALENDAR.

19:16:20 I BELIEVE THAT BEGINS WITH  ITEM 2C.
>> Mayor Mei: MR. BEEKMAN?
>> HI.

19:16:29 BLAIR BEEKMAN HERE.
I THINK I CAN DO 2C AND 2H H AT THE SAME TIME, ALAMEDA COUNTY HELP WITH 
19:16:33 HOUSING, AND I THINK A HOUSING DEVELOPMENT THAT'S GOING ALONG NILES CANYON ROAD, I THINK.

19:16:46 AND WHAT I JUST WANTED TO SAY, I JUST WANTED TO OFFER MY SIMPLE REMINDER WHAT I'M LEARNING IN THIS LIFE ABOUT 
19:16:52 -- NILES BOULEVARD.
THERE WE GO -- WHAT I'M LEARNING IN THIS LIFE IS JUST THAT WE ARE AT A 
19:17:02 TIME TO REALLY CONSIDER EXTREMELY LOW AND VERY LOW INCOME IDEAS AND PERHAPS MOST IMPORTANTLY OF ALL, HOW CAN WE 
19:17:12 CONSIDER NEW IDEAS OF MIXED INCOME HOUSING, AND HOW CAN WE ADDRESS, YOU KNOW, STATE  FACULTIES AND PROCESSES 
19:17:22 TOWARDS THAT.
THERE'S THE NPC RHNA PROCESS BUT THERE'S OTHER MTC HOUSING FUNDING 
19:17:32 IDEAS AND WAYS TO WORK.
THERE'S BAFA, THERE'S AN MTC HOUSING PROGRAM ITSELF, ALL VERY INTERESTING 
19:17:41 IDEAS TO ADDRESS SACRAMENTO ON LOCAL NEEDS OF MIXED INCOME IDEAS, NEW IDEAS OF MIXED INCOME.

19:17:46 WHAT CAN THAT BE?
I THINK THOSE IDEAS CAN REALLY HELP, YOU KNOW, BRING IN  HOMELESS COMMUNITY 
19:17:54 OUT OF THE STREETS INTO HOMES AND TO BE SHARING HOMES IN NEIGHBORHOODS THAT IT CAN BE AN ACCEPTED PRACTICE.

19:18:01 AND WE HAVE TO LEARN HOW TO ACCEPT THAT.
AND I THINK WHICH CAN, AND I THINK WE 
19:18:06 HAVE TO MAKE THOSE ATTEMPTS TO DO THAT.
SO THIS IS MY ITEMS 2C AND 2H TOGETHER 
19:18:14 BASICALLY, AND I WISH YOU LUCK IN HOW -- YOU HAD SOME REALLY GOOD BEGINNINGS WITH AFFORDABLE HOUSING IDEAS, I  
19:18:21 FEEL, AND I JUST WANT TO CONTINUE TO ENCOURAGE THE CREATIVE GOOD EFFORTS THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO CONTINUE 
19:18:29 TO WORK TOWARDS BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME IDEAS OF WHAT CAN BE REIMAGINED AND I'M REALLY  HOPEFUL HOW THAT CAN WORK 
19:18:37 TOWARDS OUR REIMAGINE FUTURE AND EQUITY, AND I THINK YOU GUYS HAVE A GOOD IDEA OF THAT, AND I HOPE THESE 
19:18:44 WORDS CAN HELP, AND THE IMPORTANCE OF REALLY CONSIDERING NEW IDEAS OF MIXED INCOME.

19:18:51 I KNOW YOU HAVE ALREADY THINK IN THOSE TERMS BUT TO REALLY BE CONSIDERING IT AND THAT'S ABOUT IT.

19:19:02 THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
NEXT SPEAKER IS ITEM 2E.

19:19:09 >> Ms. Gauthier: DO YOU WANT TO VOTE ON 2C?
>> Mayor Mei: AND DO WE HAVE ANY OTHER 
19:19:13 SPEAKERS ON 2H?
DO WE HAVE ANY OTHER SPEAKERS ON THOSE TWO ITEMS?

19:19:19 SO IT'S 2C AND 2H.
>> Councilmember Jones: MOVE TO APPROVE.

19:19:26 >> Mayor Mei: MOTION BY COUNCILMEMBER JONES, SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER COX.
>> Councilmember Cox: I WAS  TRYING TO 
19:19:32 RAISE MY HAND.
BUT I THINK SOMEBODY ELSE DID BEFORE METHOT.

19:19:37 DOUBLE-CHECK.
>> Councilmember Kassan: CAN WE SEPARATE THEM SINCE I KNOW SOME PEOPLE 
19:19:41 VOTED NO ON NILES  GATEWAY --
>> Mayor Mei: OH, SURE.
THAT'S FINE.

19:19:47 SO LET'S DO 2C AND MOTION AND SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER JONES AND COX.
PLEASE ROLL CALL VOTE.

19:19:54 >> Ms. Gauthier: YES, MADAME MAYOR.
COUNCILMEMBER COX, AYE.
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN, AYE.

19:20:06 COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, NO.
COUNCILMEMBER JONES, AYE.
COUNCILMEMBER KENG, AYE.

19:20:17 VICE MAYOR SHAO, NO.
MAYOR MEI, AYE.
SO THE MOTION PASSES, FIVE AYES AND 
19:20:24 TWO NOS WITH COUNCILMEMBERS KASSAN AND VICE MAYOR SHAO VOTING NO.
NEXT ITEM WAS ITEM 2H.

19:20:28 I THINK WE HAD A MOTION BY COUNCILMEMBER JONES AND SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER COX.

19:20:37 ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE.
>> Ms. Gauthier: COUNCILMEMBER COX, AYE.

19:20:45 COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN, AYE.
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, AYE.
COUNCILMEMBER JONES, AYE.

19:20:51 COUNCILMEMBER KENG, AYE.
VICE MAYOR SHAO, AYE.
MAYOR MEI, AYE.

19:20:57 >> Mayor Mei: THE MOTION PASSES UNANIMOUSLY.
THE NEXT ITEM PULLED FOR DISCUSSION 
19:21:06 WAS ITEM 2E AS IN EDWARD.
>> THAT WAS LISA DANS AND JOHN HINDS.
>> Mayor Mei: I THINK IT WAS JUST LISA 
19:21:13 THOUGH.
>> Ms. Gauthier: I HAD NOTED JOHN HINDS BUT IF SHE'S THE ONLY ONE THAT'S 
19:21:19 STILL RAISING HER HAND, WE CAN JUST MOVE WITH  THAT.
>> Mayor Mei: SURE.

19:21:27 >> THANK YOU FOR TAKING MY COMMENT.
I'M LISA DANS IN DISTRICT 3, AND I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THIS ITEM BECAUSE I'M 
19:21:38 CONCERNED THAT IF WE'RE ADDING A NOISE ORDINANCE FOR LOW LEVEL VIOLATION LIKE MAKING NOISE THAT THAT CAN CREATE MORE 
19:21:44 OPPORTUNITIES FOR INTERACTIONS BETWEEN COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND POLICE THAT CAN POTENTIALLY TURN DANGEROUS.

19:21:55 I WANT TO GIVE A THANK YOU AND SHOUT OUT ABOUT OUR ONGOING CONVERSATION ABOUT RACISM AND POLICING AND I THINK 
19:22:02 ONE OF THE -- SOME OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE SEE FROM SOME OF THE NATIONAL LEADERS ON HOW TO MAKE 
19:22:11 POLICING LESS DANGEROUS FOR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR IS TO STOP ENFORCING THE LOW LEVEL OFFENSES BECAUSE THOSE CREATE 
19:22:16 OPPORTUNITIES FOR HARM TO HAPPEN.
SO I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD CONSIDER WHEN WE'RE LOOKING 
19:22:22 INTO THIS MEASURE, AND I DIDN'T -- I DON'T THINK I SAW THAT IN THE STAFF REPORT AND I'M SORRY IF I MISSED IT.

19:22:30 I WOULD WANT TO SEE WHAT'S GOING TO BE THE IMPACT OF HOW MANY MORE INTERACTIONS WE EXPECT TO HAPPEN BASED 
19:22:38 ON THIS ORDINANCE VERSUS HOW MANY WE EXPECT ARE GOING TO -- THIS WOULD ACTUALLY REPLACE THE HIGHER LEVEL WITH 
19:22:43 A LOWER LEVEL AND I DO SEE THE VALUE IN THAT.
BUT FROM THE WORDING, IT SOUNDED LIKE 
19:22:47 IT WAS LIKELY TO JUST INCREASE THE NUMBER OF INTERACTIONS AND THAT'S A CONCERN.

19:22:50 THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS.

19:22:58 IF THERE'S NO COMMENTS OR IS THERE A MOTION FROM THE COUNCILMEMBERS?
COUNCILMEMBER SHAO, ARE YOU MAKING A 
19:23:04 MOTION OR ARE YOU  WANTING TO SPEAK?
>> Councilmember Kassan: I HAVE A QUESTION.

19:23:11 I WAS WONDERING IF THERE IS  ANYONE FROM THE POLICE DEPARTMENT THAT COULD TALK ABOUT THAT.

19:23:17 MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE POLICE DEPARTMENT IS ALREADY RESPONDING TO NOISE COMPLAINTS, IT'S JUST THAT 
19:23:26 THEY'RE NOT -- WE DON'T HAVE A LOCAL ORDINANCE AND SO IT'S KIND OF NOT -- YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT THAT THIS WILL 
19:23:31 INCREASE RESPONSE, IT WILL JUST MAKE IT MORE CLEAR HOW TO DEAL WITH LOCAL NOISE, BUT IF THERE'S  ANYONE FROM THE 
19:23:37 POLICE DEPARTMENT THAT COULD --
>> City Manager Danaj: CHIEF PETERSEN IS WITH US TONIGHT.

19:24:02 CHIEF?
GIVE US A MOMENT.
>> Mayor Mei: I THOUGHT I SAW ANOTHER 
19:24:09 HAND RAISED.
COUNCILMEMBER JONES?
>> Councilmember Jones: JUST REAL 
19:24:15 QUICKLY FOR COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, I WOULD SAY THAT THE ADOPTION OF THIS ORDINANCE ACTUALLY GIVES THE POLICE 
19:24:24 DEPARTMENT AN OPPORTUNITY NOT TO SEND SOMETHING FOR A CRIMINAL COMPLAINT BUT TO ADJUDICATE IT VIA A MUNICIPAL 
19:24:32 ORDINANCE RATHER THAN A COURT DATE OR A COURT TRIAL.
>> City Manager Danaj: CHIEF PETERSEN 
19:24:37 WILL BE JOINING US MOMENTARILY.
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY.
SHOULD WE MOVE ON TO THE NEXT ITEM 
19:24:41 WHILE WE'RE WAITING?
>> City Manager Danaj: SURE.
>> Mayor Mei: I THINK THAT WOULD MAKE 
19:24:46 SENSE.
THE ITEM WAS 2G.
JOHN HINDS?

19:24:54 WELCOME.
>> HELLO, EVERYONE.
EVERY PRIVATE EMPLOYER I KNOW OF 
19:25:00 EXCEPT THOSE WHO ARE ACTUALLY IN THE HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY DOESN'T MESS WITH HEALTH RECORDS.

19:25:06 THEY LEAVE THAT TO HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS AND IN MOST CASES THE EMPLOYERS ARE AT LEAST TWO STEPS REMOVED FROM IT 
19:25:11 BECAUSE THEY DEAL ONLY WITH INSURANCE  COMPANIES EVEN IN WORKER'S COMP CASES.

19:25:17 SO IT IS UNFORTUNATE THAT THE CITY IS IN A SPOT NOW WHERE WE HAVE TO SPEND SIGNIFICANT MONEY TO BUY AND INSTALL 
19:25:26 AND MAINTAIN ONE-OFF SOFTWARE AND ONE-OFF DATA STORAGE THAT ARE NOT ALL THAT CLOSE TO CORE FUNCTIONS OF A CITY 
19:25:31 GOVERNMENT.
WHEN THE OLD SOFTWARE WAS  SUNSETTED, THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN AN IDEAL TIME TO 
19:25:37 TRY AND  OUTSOURCE THIS OR ADJUST THE WORK PROCESSES IN SUCH A WAY THAT WE WON'T NEED THIS ANYMORE.

19:25:44 THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN.
AND IF TONIGHT IS NOT THE BEST TIME TO CHANGE COURSE, OKAY, BUT BEFORE THE 
19:25:51 NEXT EXTENSION OF THIS CONTRACT, AND THERE WILL PROBABLY BE ONE, I ASK, PLEASE LOOK INTO THE ANSWER TO THIS 
19:26:04 QUESTION:  WHAT WOULD WE HAVE TO CHANGE TO NO LONGER NEED THIS?
THE COSTS ARE ONLY GOING TO GO UP OVER 
19:26:09 TIME, AND WE SHOULD NOT GET TOO CAUGHT UP IN THE QUESTION OF WHAT WE'VE ALREADY SPENT BECAUSE THAT'S PROBABLY 
19:26:16 JUST THE BEGINNING.
NOT ONLY TO ONE-OFF SYSTEMS ALWAYS COST MORE THAN YOU EXPECT THEM TO, 
19:26:24 EVEN WHEN YOU TAKE THAT RULE INTO ACCOUNT, HEALTHCARE SECURITY LAWS CONTINUE TO BE TIGHTENED SO THE COST 
19:26:30 OF  COMPLYING WITH THOSE JUST KEEP GOING UP.
THAT'S THE END OF MY COMMENT FOR 2G.

19:26:37 I CAN CALL IN SEPARATELY FOR 2K.
THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:26:45 I SEE A PANELIST HAND RAISED.
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN, DO YOU HAVE A QUESTION ON THIS ITEM?

19:26:50 >> Councilmember Salwan: I WAS WONDERING IF STAFF CAN ADDRESS THE NEED FOR THIS.

19:27:08 
>> Ms. Shenfil: I CAN ADDRESS THAT.
IT TURNED MY VOICE ON BUT NOT MY 
19:27:10 FACE.
THERE WE GO.
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN, AS YOU MAY BE 
19:27:17 AWARE, THE HUMAN SERVICES DEPARTMENT DELIVERS A VARIETY OF HEALTH-RELATED SERVICES.

19:27:26 WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT CONTRACT FROM THE COUNTY FOR THE DELIVERY OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES THAT COVER AGING AND 
19:27:31 FAMILY SERVICES TO YOUTH AND FAMILY SERVICES.
WE ALSO PROVIDE FAMILY SUPPORT THROUGH 
19:27:40 CASE MANAGEMENT.
WE'RE NOW WORKING WITH THE METH TEAM DOING CRISIS INTERVENTION AND ALL 
19:27:47 THESE REQUIRE KEEPING OF INFORMATION AND DATA THAT WE SHOULD -- ACROSS OUR DIVISIONS AND WE USE TO PROVIDE 
19:27:58 RESOURCES AND SERVICE CONTINUITY.
ALSO TO GENERATE BILLING, WHICH IS REQUIRED BY OUR CONTRACTS.

19:28:10 NOT ONLY WITH THE COUNTY BUT OTHER ENTITIES THAT FUND US, AND REALLY TO PROVIDE COORDINATION ACROSS OUR 
19:28:15 DIVISIONS.
WE MAY HAVE A FAMILY SITUATION WHERE SOMEBODY IS WORKING WITH A CHILD IN 
19:28:23 YOUTH AND FAMILY SERVICES AND SOMEBODY IS WORKING WITH THE GRANDMOTHER IN AGING AND FAMILY SERVICES AND OUR 
19:28:36 HEALTH RECORD ALLOWS US TO LOOK AT THE WHOLE FAMILY SITUATION AND REALLY PROVIDE A BETTER LEVEL OF SERVICE.

19:28:43 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
SO WITH THAT CLARIFICATION, DO WE HAVE A MOTION FOR ITEM 2G AS IN GEORGE?

19:28:49 >> Councilmember Salwan: MOVED.
>> Mayor Mei: MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN, SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER 
19:28:57 KASSAN.
PLEASE VOTE.
ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE.

19:29:02 >> Ms. Gauthier: COUNCILMEMBER COX, AYE.
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN, AYE.

19:29:09 COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, AYE.
COUNCILMEMBER JONES, AYE.
COUNCILMEMBER KENG, AYE.

19:29:17 VICE MAYOR SHAO, AYE.
MAYOR MEI, AYE.
>> Mayor Mei: SO ITEM 2G PASSES 
19:29:22 UNANIMOUSLY.
>> City Manager Danaj: CHIEF PETERSEN IS BACK.

19:29:27 >> Mayor Mei: WE'RE GOING TO RETURN TO 2E AND I SEE OUR CHIEF HAS JUST JOINED US.

19:29:32 >> THANKS, MY APOLOGIES.
I GOT KNOCKED OFF THE CALL FOR A MOMENT THERE BUT I'M BACK.

19:29:37 I DIDN'T HEAR THE QUESTION THAT WAS ASKED OF ME.
SO IF SOMEBODY COULD RE-ASK THE 
19:29:42 QUESTION.
>> City Manager Danaj:COUNCILME MBER KASSAN, WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO TRY TO 
19:29:46 REITERATE IT?
>> Councilmember Kassan: IT WAS JUST THAT WE HAD A MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC ASK 
19:29:53 IF THE PASSAGE OF THIS NOISE ORDINANCE WOULD LEAD TO MORE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THE POLICE AND MEMBERS OF THE 
19:30:00 PUBLIC WHICH COULD GO AGAINST OUR DESIRE TO MAKE SURE THAT POLICE AREN'T GETTING INVOLVED IN THINGS THAT AREN'T 
19:30:08 NECESSARILY, YOU KNOW, THE RIGHT -- THAT THEY MAY NOT BE THE RIGHT FIT FOR EVERY INTERACTION, BUT MY 
19:30:12 UNDERSTANDING WAS THAT WE'RE ALREADY -- THE POLICE DEPARTMENT IS ALREADY DEALING WITH NOISE COMPLAINTS AND IT'S 
19:30:18 JUST A MATTER OF MAKING THAT PROCESS MORE STRAIGHTFORWARD BUT IF YOU COULD JUST CLARIFY THAT.

19:30:24 >> SURE, ABSOLUTELY.
YEAH, THE IMPETUS BEHIND THIS IS BECAUSE WE DO DEAL WITH ACTUALLY OVER 
19:30:33 A THOUSAND NOISE COMPLAINTS EACH YEAR, AND YOU KNOW, OUR KIND OF TYPICAL MOST COMMON NOISE COMPLAINT IS LATE NIGHT 
19:30:39 PARTIES, LOUD MUSIC AT NIGHT, AND BARKING DOGS.
AND MY ENTIRE CAREER, WE HAVE NOT HAD 
19:30:44 A NOISE ORDINANCE THAT PROVIDES A SIMPLE LOW LEVEL OPTION FOR MANAGING THESE  THINGS.

19:30:50 I WILL TELL YOU THAT IN MOST CASES, WE'LL GO OUT ONCE AND WE SIMPLY WARN THE PERSON TO EITHER TURN DOWN THE 
19:30:59 MUSIC, QUIET DOWN THE PARTY OR BRING THE DOG INSIDE.
BEYOND THAT, IF THE CALLER CALLS 
19:31:07 AGAIN, REALLY RIGHT NOW, ALL WE HAVE AS AN OPTION IS TO USE A MISDEMEANOR LEVEL CITATION WHICH WOULD REQUIRE THE 
19:31:13 COMPLAINING PARTY TO QUOTE-UNQUOTE SIGN A COMPLAINT AND THEN IT REQUIRES A POLICE REPORT, IT GOES TO THE  D.A.'S 
19:31:19 OFFICE AND REALLY WE JUST DON'T NEED THAT AS THE ONLY  TOOL.
WHAT WE NEED IS A LOWER LEVEL TOOL, SO 
19:31:26 WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR WITH THIS NOISE ORDINANCE IS TO ALLOW US TO WRITE A SIMPLE CITATION IN THOSE CASES.

19:31:32 LIKE I SAID, TYPICALLY WE GIVE A WARNING THE FIRST TIME THAT WE GO TO THESE THINGS, BUT THIS WILL GIVE US 
19:31:38 THAT LOWER LEVEL TOOL TO WRITE A CITATION RATHER THAN TRYING TO DO A MISDEMEANOR POLICE REPORT AND 
19:31:43 COMPLAINT, WHICH WE WOULD THEN SEND TO THE D.A.
SO I THINK IT JUST ACTUALLY GIVES A 
19:31:50 BETTER TOOL IN THE TOOLKIT, BECAUSE IN MOST OF THESE CASES, YOU KNOW, IF A PERSON CONTINUES WITH LET'S SAY 
19:31:55 PLAYING THE LOUD MUSIC OR THE BAND PRACTICE LATE AT NIGHT, WE DON'T WANT TO BE A MISDEMEANOR.

19:32:04 WE SIMPLY WANT TO WRITE A CITATION AS AN OPTION.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU FOR THE 
19:32:09 CLARIFICATION.
DO I HAVE A MOTION TO APPROVE ITEM 2C?

19:32:15 >> Vice Mayor Shao: SO MOVED.
>> Mayor Mei: MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER SHAO AND SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER 
19:32:18 COX.
PLEASE, ROLL CALL VOTE.
>> Ms. Gauthier: COUNCILMEMBER COX, 
19:32:24 AYE.
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN, AYE.
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, AYE.

19:32:31 COUNCILMEMBER JONES, AYE.
COUNCILMEMBER KENG, AYE.
VICE MAYOR SHAO, AYE.

19:32:37 MAYOR MEI, AYE.
>> Mayor Mei: SO ITEM 2E PASSES UNANIMOUSLY.

19:32:45 NEXT IS ITEM 2I THAT WAS PULLED FOR COMMENT BY --
>> Ms. Gauthier: BLAIR BEEKMAN.

19:32:49 >> Mayor Mei: MR. BEEKMAN.
>> HI.
THANK YOU.

19:33:03 TO SPEAK ON ITEM I.
THIS IS ABOUT THE CITY HAS MADE AN AGREEMENT WITH SISERCO  ENERGY, 
19:33:12 BASICALLY THEY'RE KIND OF AN ENERGY PURVEYOR FOR LOCAL COMMUNITIES, AND THEY KIND OF -- YOU KNOW, BROKER, 
19:33:17 ENERGY BROKER MAYBE IS A TERM?
THE FUSD WAS JUST WORKING WITH THEM A FEW WEEKS AGO.

19:33:26 IT WAS AN AGENDA ITEM TO TALK ABOUT THE FUTURE OF WORKING WITH THIS GROUP.
I THINK THEIR WORK CAN BE CONSIDERED A 
19:33:36 LITTLE QUESTIONABLE AND CONTROVERSIAL, AND I JUST WANTED TO MAKE LIGHT OF THAT AND THAT FOR INSTANCE, WE'RE 
19:33:45 GOING TO SAY IT STRAIGHT OUT, WE MAY POSSIBLY BE IN STORE FOR SOME SORT OF NATURAL DISASTER LIKE A LARGE 
19:33:56 EARTHQUAKE IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS.
AND IT'S UP TO THIS ENERGY GROUP TO KIND OF FACILITATE WHAT ENERGY CHOICES 
19:34:00 WE'RE GOING TO BE MAKING IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS.
AND THEY HAVE KIND OF ONE OF THOSE BAD 
19:34:07 HABITS OF FACILITATING IN WAYS THAT ARE JUST KIND OF NOT VERY INSPIRING BASICALLY.

19:34:16 WE'RE AT A TIME TO REALLY BUILD UP OUR RENEWABLE IDEAS.
AND REALLY PRACTICE THOSE IDEAS.

19:34:22 AND EVEN IF THERE IS AN UPCOMING NATURAL DISASTER, WE'RE AT A TIME TO REALLY CONTINUE REALLY BUILDING UP 
19:34:31 RENEWABLE IDEAS THAT ARE REALLY POSITIVE AND GOOD AND IT'S OUR BETTER PRACTICES AND IT'S FROM BUILDING THOSE 
19:34:40  RENEWABLE IDEAS THAT IF A MAJOR DISASTER DOES HAPPEN AGAIN IN THE BAY AREA, WE CAN BE READY TO TRANSITION 
19:34:48 SOONER TO OUR GOOD PRACTICES OUT OF THAT -- OUT OF A NATURAL DISASTER TIME.

19:34:56 WITH ENERGY GROUPS LIKE THIS, I JUST HAVE THE FEELING THEY'RE JUST GOING TO GO FOR THE TOTAL BOTTOM LINE AND JUST 
19:35:03 A LOT OF DIRTY FUEL ENERGY AND JUST TOTALLY MAKE THE DEALS, CUT THE DEALS AS OPPOSED TO WORKING TOWARDS OUR 
19:35:10 REALLY GOOD PRACTICES.
SO I JUST WANTED TO PREPARE YOURSELVES FOR THAT THINKING AND REALLY BE 
19:35:26 CONSIDERED AND REALLY ASK THIS COMPANY TO MAKE GOOD CHOICES AND DON'T JUST LIVE IN OUR BASE INSTINCTS IF WE HAVE 
19:35:33 A NATURAL DISASTER COMING UP.
IN PREPARING FOR SUCH A PROBLEM TO ONE DAY OCCUR AND THEN IT'S OUT OF THAT, 
19:35:39 THAT'S HOW WE CONTINUE OUR GOOD PRACTICES TOWARDS OUR GOOD FUTURE.
IT'S NOT BY JUST, YOU KNOW, MAKING THE 
19:35:43 DEAL, IT'S NOT CUTTING THE CHEAPEST DEAL, NOT GETTING THE BARGAIN OF THE  CHEAPEST FUEL.

19:35:51 AND I JUST WANTED TO MAKE  EVERYONE AWARE OF THAT AS WELL AS I CAN.
THANK YOU.

19:35:55 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
DO WE HAVE ANY COMMENTS OR A MOTION BY COUNCILMEMBERS?

19:36:07 COUNCILMEMBER COX?
>> Councilmember Cox: YES, I WANTED TO FOLLOW UP WITH THE COMMENT THAT WAS 
19:36:15 MADE IN REGARDING TO THE DISASTER RECOVERY, AND IF THEY COULD JUST EXPLAIN THAT PART OF THAT IS PART OF 
19:36:21 THE TECHNOLOGY  AGREEMENT, IS THAT CORRECT?
WITH OUR I.T. DIRECTOR POSSIBLY?

19:36:29 >> Mr. Larsen: I CAN SPEAK TO THAT, COUNCILMEMBER COX.
SO I THINK THE COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE 
19:36:37 BY MR. BEEKMAN AREN'T NECESSARILY KIND OF ALIGNED WITH THE CONTRACT THAT WE HAVE ON THE COUNCIL AGENDA.

19:36:48 ESSENTIALLY WHAT WE HAVE, THE CITY HAS A MANAGEMENT SYSTEM FOR OUR HEATING, VENTILATION, AIR CONDITIONING SYSTEMS 
19:36:56 FOR 37 OF OUR CITY BUILDINGS, AND SO THE ITEM ON THE AGENDA IS A SERVICE CONTRACT WITH A COMPANY TO HELP US 
19:37:05 MAINTAIN THAT AND DO SOFTWARE UPDATES SO THAT THE SYSTEM RUNS EFFICIENTLY.
SO THE COMPANY THAT WE'RE CONTRACTING 
19:37:13 WITH MAY BE IN OTHER LINES OF BUSINESS THAT  MR. BEEKMAN REFERENCED, BUT THAT'S NOT SORT OF AN ITEM THAT'S 
19:37:19 RELATED TO WHAT'S ON THE AGENDA.
HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY OTHER QUESTIONS.
>> Councilmember Cox: SO THIS IS JUST 
19:37:28 BASICALLY A SERVICE AGREEMENT FOR BUILDING MAINTENANCE FOR OUR 37 CITY BUILDINGS AND THIS TYPE OF SERVICE 
19:37:35 AGREEMENT?
>> Mr. Larsen: YES, SPECIFICALLY FOR THE TECHNOLOGY, BASICALLY THE NETWORK 
19:37:44 TECHNOLOGY THAT CONTROLS THE HEATING VENTILATION AND AIR CONDITIONING.
SO ESSENTIALLY ALL BUILDINGS ARE SET 
19:37:54 TO HAVE THE SYSTEMS GO ON, SHUT DOWN, MANAGE TEMPERATURE, AND SO THE CENTRAL COMPUTER SYSTEM THAT RUNS IT NEEDS 
19:38:01 ANNUAL MAINTENANCE OR TROUBLESHOOTING ON AN AS-NEEDED BASIS.
SO THIS CONTRACT PROVIDES US WITH 
19:38:05 THOSE TECHNICAL SERVICES TO SUPPORT THIS PART OF OUR  BUILDING MANAGEMENT.

19:38:13 >> Councilmember Cox: THANK YOU SO MUCH.
>> Mayor Mei: ANY OTHER COMMENTS FROM 
19:38:18 OUR PANELISTS OR CAN I GET A MOTION, PLEASE?
>> Councilmember Cox: SO MOVED.

19:38:22 >> Mayor Mei: OKAY.
MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER SHAO AND SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER COX.

19:38:29 PLEASE ROLL CALL VOTE.
>> Ms. Gauthier: COUNCILMEMBER COX, AYE.

19:38:38 COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN, AYE.
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, AYE.
COUNCILMEMBER JONES, AYE.

19:38:43 COUNCILMEMBER KENG, AYE.
VICE MAYOR SHAO, AYE.
MAYOR MEI, AYE.

19:38:52 THE ITEM PASSES UNANIMOUSLY.
NEXT IS ITEM 2K.
>> Ms. Gauthier: JOHN HINDS AND BLAIR 
19:39:01 BEEKMAN, I BELIEVE WERE THE ONES WHO WANTED TO SPEAK ON THIS ITEM.
>> Mayor Mei: YES.

19:39:17 WE'LL START WITH BLAIR BEEKMAN.
MR. BEEKMAN?
>> HI, BLAIR BEEKMAN HERE.

19:39:20 CAN YOU HEAR ME?
>> Mayor Mei: YES.
>> THANK YOU.

19:39:26 SORRY, I REALLY DON'T WANT TO CAUSE ANY ALARM OR PANIC, I'M REALLY SORRY.
I'M TRYING TO FIGURE LIVE OUT MYSELF 
19:39:29 AT THIS TIME IN THE BAY AREA.
I'M SORRY I DIDN'T WANT TO CAUSE ANY HARM.

19:39:40 I THINK THAT IS WHAT CISCO --  SYSERCO, HOWEVER YOU PRONOUNCE THEIR NAME, THEY DO A NUMBER OF PRACTICES.

19:39:50 THANK YOU FOR THE CLARIFICATION BY HANS LARSEN AND -- YEAH.
SO I GUESS OUR LIVES CONTINUE.

19:39:59 SORRY FOR ANY INCONVENIENCE IN MY SPEAKING.
ABOUT THIS ISSUE, THIS IS AN ISSUE 
19:40:07 THAT I JUST -- BOY, I  JUST -- I'M LEARNING THAT, YOU KNOW, AS A PUBLIC COMMUNITY, EVERYDAY COMMUNITY, A LOT 
19:40:11 OF THINGS AREN'T SAID BY CITY GOVERNMENT.
I JUST WANT TO USE MY PUBLIC COMMENT 
19:40:18 TIME TO SPEAK THE MOST OF WHAT I KNOW ABOUT A SUBJECT AND HOPEFULLY THAT CAN JUST HELP THE COMMUNITY PROCESS 
19:40:23 ALONG.
I DON'T WANT TO, YOU KNOW, CAUSE MASSIVE FIGHTS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT 
19:40:28 ABOUT THINGS.
I JUST SIMPLY WANT TO STATE WHERE THINGS ARE AT THE BEST I CAN, AND WITH 
19:40:38 SCOOTER  TECHNOLOGY, I MEAN, IT'S GOING TO INVOLVE A LOT OF SURVEILLANCE AND DATA COLLECTION TECH IN OUR FUTURE.

19:40:44 IS THAT A PART OF THIS NEW SCOOTER SYSTEM THAT YOU'RE EMPLOYING AT THIS TIME?

19:40:54 IN SAN JOSÉ, YOU KNOW, THEY'RE DEVELOPING A WHOLE GEO FENCE SECURITY SYSTEM WHERE SCOOTERS ARE ONLY ALLOWED 
19:41:07 IN CERTAIN AVENUES AND LANES AND PARTS OF DOWNTOWN SAN JOSÉ.
THERE'S COMMERCIAL DATA COLLECTION 
19:41:21 PRACTICES, SURVEY DATA COLLECTION PRACTICES, THAT CAN BE A SHARED OPEN PROCESS, IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE 
19:41:28 COMBATIVE OR SECRETIVE.
I MEAN, THIS IS OUR FUTURE, THIS IS OUR IOT FUTURE WHERE YOU  KNOW, 
19:41:34 EVERYBODY IS A PART OF THE PROCESS NOW, YOU KNOW?
IT ISN'T JUST GOVERNMENT DICTATING 
19:41:40 MANDATE TO HAND DOWN TO THE PUBLIC.
THIS IS A SHARED PROCESS.
AND WE'RE DEVELOPING THE OPEN PUBLIC 
19:41:45 POLICIES TO DO THAT AT THIS TIME.
AND THESE ARE THE IDEAS OF PEACE AND NOT WAR.

19:41:50 THESE ARE THE IDEAS OF  DEMOCRACY, LONG TERM DEMOCRACY, AND SUSTAINABLE DEMOCRACY.

19:42:00 THIS IS OUR GOOD FUTURE.
SO IF YOU CAN LEARN TO SHARE OPEN PUBLIC POLICY IDEAS FOR THE SCOOTER 
19:42:08 ISSUES AND ALL OF ITS DATA -- THAT'S IMPORTANT GOOD STUFF AND THAT'S ALL I'M TRYING TO DO, A FUTURE OF PEACE 
19:42:17 AND SUSTAINABILITY AND NOT WAR AND NOT COVID-19 PANDEMICS.
I BELIEVE THAT UP TO YOU TO DECIDE 
19:42:19 WHAT'S BEST.
THANKS.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU, NEXT SPEAKER 
19:42:24 IS JOHN HINDS.
WELCOME.
>> HELLO, EVERYONE.

19:42:32 IN MONTEREY, THERE'S A TRAIL TWO OR THREE MILES LONG SORT OF CENTERED ON CANNERY ROW, AND ON THAT TRAIL FOR THE 
19:42:40 LAST FEW DECADE, THERE HAVE BEEN AT LEAST TWO, SOMETIMES THREE VIABLE BUSINESSES RENTING BIKES AND SURREYS 
19:42:44 TO PEOPLE.
AND THOSE COMPANIES HAVE BEEN ABLE TO STAY AFLOAT BECAUSE THE CUSTOMERS 
19:42:50 VALUE THAT SERVICE SO MUCH, THEY WERE ACTUALLY WILLING TO PAY FOR IT WITH THEIR OWN MONEY.

19:43:00 SIMILARLY, THERE IS AN OPERATION IN SAN FRANCISCO AT FISHERMAN'S WHARF WITH THE AWESOME NAME OF BLAZING SADDLES 
19:43:06 BIKE RENTALS.
THEY HAVE BEEN AROUND FOR YEARS BUT MAY HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY COVID.

19:43:10 THERE WAS AN EXPERIMENT IN MOUNTAIN VIEW EIGHT OR NINE YEARS AGO THAT I RECALL.

19:43:14 THIS ONE WAS DIFFERENT BECAUSE THERE'S NO TIE-IN TO TOURISM.
IT WAS JUST FOR CONVENIENCE AND 
19:43:20 COMMUTING VERY SIMILAR TO THIS CONCEPT FOR FREMONT.
THAT EXPERIMENT LASTED JUST A FEW 
19:43:24 MONTHS AND GOT DISMANTLED.
SO IT MUST NOT HAVE WORKED OUT VERY WELL.

19:43:27 BUT THAT IS IN THE NATURE OF THESE EXPERIMENTS.
SOMETIMES THEY WORK AND SOMETIMES THEY 
19:43:34 DON'T.
WHAT WE SHOULD WANT TO AVOID IS FALLING INTO A SITUATION WHERE WE'RE 
19:43:40 PROVIDING A SERVICE THAT OTHER PEOPLE WILL USE ONLY SO LONG AS SOMEONE ELSE IS PAYING FOR IT, BECAUSE THAT IS NOT 
19:43:48 SUSTAINABLE.
ALTHOUGH WE'RE IN AN ODD MOMENT RIGHT NOW BECAUSE MTC IS WILLING TO PAY FOR 
19:43:52 IT.
SO UNDER THESE CONDITIONS, I SAY BY ALL MEANS, LET'S RUN THE EXPERIMENT, 
19:43:56 GET THE INFRASTRUCTURE SET UP, GIVE US A CHANCE TO SEE WHAT THE DEMAND REALLY IS.

19:44:05 BY THE END OF THE EXPERIMENT, WE'LL BE MAKING DECISIONS AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO DRAW UP THOSE DECISION CRITERIA 
19:44:11 BEFOREHAND, AND NOT TRY TO MAKE IT UP AFTERWARDS BECAUSE THAT'S WHEN IT BECOMES SO EASY TO FOOL OURSELVES.

19:44:18 ONE REALLY GOOD MEASURE OF SUCCESS WOULD BE TO ASK THE VENDOR NOW WHAT IS THEIR BREAK EVEN POINT?

19:44:28 THAT IS, WHAT VOLUME TO TURN TO NO LONGER NEED ANY SUBSIDIES FROM US.
MAYBE WE KNOW THAT NUMBER ALREADY BUT 
19:44:33 IF NOT, THIS IS THE TIME TO ASK FOR IT AND IF THEY'RE REALLY UP TO MANAGING THIS THING, THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO 
19:44:38 GIVE US THAT FIGURE WITHIN A COUPLE DAYS.
AND IF AT THE END OF THE EXPERIMENT 
19:44:43 WE'VE REACHED THE BREAK EVEN POINT, WONDERFUL.
IT'S A SUCCESS AND WE NO LONGER NEED 
19:44:50 TO SUBSIDIZE IT.
SO TO SUMMARIZE, YES, LET'S RUN THE EXPERIMENT WHILE MTC IS PAYING FOR 
19:44:52 IT.
WE SHOULD DECLARE OUR DECISION CRITERIA AT THE BEGINNING OF THE 
19:45:02 EXPERIMENT AND BREAK EVEN WOULD BE A REALLY GOOD DEFINITION OF SUCCESS.
THANK YOU.

19:45:05 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
SEEING NO OTHER SPEAKERS, I'LL BRING IT BACK TO THE COUNCIL.

19:45:12 ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS?
SEEING NONE, COULD I GET A MOTION, PLEASE?

19:45:19 AND THIS IS FOR ITEM 2K.
>> Vice Mayor Shao: SO MOVED.
>> Mayor Mei: MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER 
19:45:23 SHAO, SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN.
PLEASE ROLL CALL VOTE.

19:45:28 >> Ms. Gauthier: COUNCILMEMBER COX, AYE.
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN, AYE.

19:45:35 COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, AYE.
COUNCILMEMBER JONES, AYE.
COUNCILMEMBER KENG, AYE.

19:45:43 VICE MAYOR SHAO, AYE.
MAYOR MEI, AYE.
SO THE ITEM 2K PASSES UNANIMOUSLY.

19:45:51 NEXT IS ITEM 2L.
AND I BELIEVE THAT WAS PULLED BY BLAIR BEEKMAN.

19:45:55 >> HI.
YEAH, THANK YOU.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE WITH MY 
19:46:04 MANY ITEMS I PULLED TODAY.
FOR THIS ITEM, THIS IS A  RENTAL -- FEDERAL RENTAL ASSISTANCE HELP, WHICH 
19:46:15 IS REALLY GREAT STUFF.
I MEAN, IF WE CAN WORK TOWARD FULL RENT FORGIVENESS, I THINK THAT'S THE 
19:46:20 GOAL, TO TAKE CARE OF BOTH OWNERS AND TENANTS.
I MEAN, THAT'S AN AMAZING CONCEPT.

19:46:28 I MEAN, IT'S SUCH AN AMAZING CONCEPT THAT OWNERS DO NOT HAVE TO FIGHT THEIR TENANT BASICALLY, AND LEAVE THEM HIGH 
19:46:42 AND DRY.
AND THE POINT OF MY WORRIES OF THIS TIME OF COVID IS THAT I REALLY KNEEL 
19:46:49  FEEL WE HAVE TO CONSIDER COVID IS NOT THE FAULT OF EVERYDAY PEOPLE.
AND I THINK WE HAVE TO LEARN TO 
19:46:55 ACKNOWLEDGE THAT.
I THINK AT THE STATE GOVERNMENT LEVEL, AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL, THERE'S A LOT -- 
19:47:04 IF NOT THE MAJORITY, IF NOT ALL OF THE POLITICIANS, REALLY KNOW -- OR THE POLICY MAKERS REALLY KNOW THAT THEY 
19:47:12 TRY TO BUILD POLICY THAT IS ABOUT THAT.
THE EVERYDAY COMMUNITY IS SIMPLY NOT 
19:47:15 AT FAULT.
AND THAT'S HOW THEY BUILD POLICY BASICALLY.

19:47:24 AND IT'S JUST A MATTER OF HOW MUCH CAN WE WORK WITH THAT, HOW MUCH CAN WE DEVELOP OUR IDEAS OF A BETTER FUTURE 
19:47:34 OUT OF THIS COVID MESS?
THAT I THINK REALLY NEEDS TO BE CONSIDERED, IT'S NOT JUST CHINA, IT'S 
19:47:42 A CONSORTIUM OF HIGH ELITES BASICALLY, IT'S MORE THAN CHINA, I FEEL PERSONALLY, MY PERSONAL OPINIONS HERE, 
19:47:50 AND TO ADDRESS THE SITUATION MORE FORMALLY, FROM SUCH A GROUP OF ELITES, THEY HAVE PASSED ALONG A CONDITION 
19:47:54 THAT WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH.
AND WE'RE TRYING OUR DARNDEST TO DEAL WITH IT.

19:48:02 AND I THINK WE CAN MAKE REALLY INTELLIGENT CHOICES OUT OF THIS TIME, YOU KNOW, FIRST AND FOREMOST THAT IF 
19:48:10 WE'RE GOING TO PRACTICE OUR FUTURE  SUSTAINABILITY, WE DON'T HAVE TO HURT EACH OTHER IN OUR FUTURE PLANNING OF 
19:48:17 OUR FUTURE LARGE SCALE SOCIAL PLANNING BASICALLY.
WE SHOULDN'T BE DOING THIS TO EACH 
19:48:21 OTHER.
BUT SINCE WE ARE, LET'S DO IT WELL AND LET'S DO IT WHERE OTHER PEOPLE DON'T 
19:48:25 GET HURT.
EVERYDAY PEOPLE DO NOT HAVE TO BE HURT BY THESE PRACTICES.

19:48:39 OF A FEW CERTAIN ELITES.
SO I HOPE WE'RE LEARNING TO ADDRESS THIS AND -- YEAH, THANK YOU, THAT THIS 
19:48:46 FORGIVENESS THINGS ARE HAPPENING.
TO MENTION THE WASHINGTON HOSPITAL ISSUES, IS IT POSSIBLY HEALTHCARE 
19:48:51 FORGIVENESS FOR PRIVATE HOSPITALS THAT'S ON THE AGENDA?
THERE'S A LARGE LIST OF ISSUES THAT -- 
19:48:59 IT'S TOUGH TO LEARN TO ADDRESS, I HOPE WE'RE LEARNING TO DO THAT.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:49:05 ARE THERE ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS OR A MOTION FROM THE COUNCIL FOR ITEM 2L?

19:49:07 
>> Councilmember Jones: MOVE TO APPROVE.

19:49:13 >> Councilmember Cox: SECOND.
>> Mayor Mei: ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE.
>> Ms. Gauthier: COUNCILMEMBER COX, 
19:49:19 AYE.
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN, AYE.
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, AYE.

19:49:25 COUNCILMEMBER JONES, AYE.
COUNCILMEMBER KENG, AYE.
VICE MAYOR SHAO, AYE.

19:49:32 MAYOR MEI, AYE.
>> Mayor Mei: ITEM 2L PASSES UNANIMOUSLY.

19:49:43 NEXT ON THE AGENDA THIS EVENING IS ITEM 5A, WHICH IS THE SPRING 2021 CODE AND MAP AMENDMENTS, AND WE HAVE SENIOR 
19:49:49 PLANNER BILL ROTH WHO'S GOING TO BE HERE TONIGHT FOR OVERVIEW, AND HIS STAFF IS AVAILABLE FOR  QUESTIONS.

19:49:59 I JUST WANTED TO MENTION THERE WAS A GREEN SHEET ON THIS ITEM TOO, JUST IN CASE PEOPLE HAD NOT SEEN IT.

19:50:03 >> GOOD EVENING.
CITY STAFF PERIODICALLY PREPARES UPDATES TO THE ZONING ORDINANCE AND 
19:50:09 OTHER SECTIONS OF THE MUNICIPAL CODE TO CORRECT INCONSISTENCIES AND MAKE REVISIONS CONSISTENT WITH THE GENERAL 
19:50:16 PLAN AND STATE LAW.
TONIGHT'S CODE UPDATES COVER APPROXIMATELY 20 DIFFERENT  ITEMS.

19:50:21 NOTABLE AMONGST THEM ARE THE PROPOSED CHANGES TO THE DOWNTOWN DISTRICT WHICH RESULTED FROM A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT 
19:50:27 BETWEEN THE CITY'S ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT, COMMERCIAL PROPERTY OWNERS IN THE DOWNTOWN AND PLANNING STAFF TO 
19:50:33 BETTER ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF BUSINESSES AND THE COMMUNITY IN AN EVER-CHANGING ECONOMY.

19:50:39 WITH THE PROPOSED CODE CHANGES, THE PERMITTED USE TABLE FOR THE DOWNTOWN DISTRICT WILL ALLOW WIDER RANGE OF 
19:50:46 USES BY RIGHT AND REDUCE SOME PERMIT REQUIREMENTS SUCH AS THOSE PERTAINING TO RESTAURANTS AND EDUCATIONAL AND 
19:50:53 RECREATIONAL USES TO BETTER SUPPORT COMMERCIAL VIABILITY AND RESPOND TO CHANGING CONSUMER DEMAND DURING AND 
19:51:01 FOLLOWING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC.
THESE CHANGES ARE CONSISTENT WITH TWO OF THE TOP PRIORITIES THAT THE CITY 
19:51:07 COUNCIL IDENTIFIED IN 2021, CONTINUING THE CITY'S RESPONSE TO COVID-19 AND NEIGHBORHOOD IMPROVEMENT.

19:51:13 STAFF WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON UPDATING RECOLLECTIONS TO BETTER SUPPORT BUSINESSES IN COMMERCIAL CENTERS AND 
19:51:19 ENCOURAGE OCCUPANCY OF VACANT TENANT SPACES.
OUR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT MANAGER 
19:51:31 DONOVAN LAZARO IS HERE TONIGHT.
ALSO THE ADDITION OF AN URBAN FARMING ORDINANCE TO ALLOW COMMUNITY GARDENS 
19:51:40 ON INFILL SITES, MEETING CERTAIN PERFORMANCE STANDARDS AND ASSISTIVE LIVING DEVICES AND ALLOW THEM BY RIGHT 
19:51:48 IN SOME MIXED USE AND MULTIFAMILY RESIDENTIAL ZONES AND BY CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT IN MORE COMMERCIAL ZONES.

19:51:52 PLANNER COURTNEY PAL IS HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS ON THE ASSISTED LIVING ORDINANCE.

19:51:58 TONIGHT'S UPDATE PACKAGE ALSO INCLUDES AMENDMENTS TO THE GENERAL PLAN AND ZONING MAPS TO CLARIFY OR CORRECT THE 
19:52:03  BOUNDARIES OF VARIOUS LAND USE DESIGNATIONS AND ZONING DISTRICTS.
STAFF IS AVAILABLE TO DISCUSS THE 
19:52:10 VARIOUS AMENDMENTS PROPOSED TONIGHT.
THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: ARE THERE ANY 
19:52:16 QUESTIONS?
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN.


19:52:23 >> Councilmember Kassan: HELLO, YES.
I WOULD LOVE TO UNDERSTAND A LITTLE BIT BETTER WHAT'S  HAPPENING WITH THE 
19:52:36 COMMERCIAL CORRIDOR USE DESIGNATIONS.
I KNOW THAT RETAIL IS CHANGING A LOT.
COVID HAS HAD A HUGE EFFECT ON RETAIL 
19:52:47 AND REQUIRING TYPICAL RETAIL AND EATING ESTABLISHMENTS IN COMMERCIAL CORRIDORS CAN BE A CHALLENGE, BUT I ALSO FEEL 
19:52:55 THAT IF WE MAKE IT TOO EASY TO PUT OFFICES ON THE GROUND FLOOR IN COMMERCIAL CORRIDORS, THAT THERE'S A 
19:53:02 BIG CHANCE THAT WE'LL KILL ANY POSSIBILITY OF HAVING A WALKABLE PLEASANT DOWNTOWN AREA, MEANING ALL OF 
19:53:10 OUR DOWNTOWNS.
AND I KNOW THAT THERE HAS BEEN DISCUSSION ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF 
19:53:21 DOING LIKE A WHOLE WORK SESSION ON UPDATING OUR MIXED USE DEFINITION AND ALL OF THAT, BUT I JUST WANT TO BE 
19:53:30 REALLY, REALLY CAREFUL ABOUT -- BECAUSE OF THE CONDITIONS THAT WE'VE BEEN IN FOR THE LAST YEAR, THEY ARE TEMPORARY 
19:53:36 AND I THINK OUR GOAL SHOULD BE TO EXPECT THAT, YOU KNOW, LIFE WILL GO BACK TO NORMAL, PEOPLE WILL CONTINUE 
19:53:45 TO WANT TO HAVE A NICE WALKABLE AREA WITH SHOPS AND RESTAURANTS AND NOT JUST A WALL OF LIKE DOCTORS' OFFICES.

19:53:54 SO I JUST WANT TO GET SOME MORE CLARIFICATION ON WHAT'S EXACTLY HAPPENING WITH RESPECT TO THAT IN THIS 
19:54:03 -- IN THESE AMENDMENTS.
>> I THINK STAFF SHARES THAT CONCERN CERTAINLY AND THAT'S WHY WE WORK WITH 
19:54:08 ECONOMIC  DEVELOPMENT.
SO I WILL HAND IT OFF TO DONOVAN TO ADDRESS THAT BROADER TOPIC.

19:54:13 CERTAINLY AREAS ARE A LOT LESS INTERESTING IF THEY CONTINUE TO HAVE THE SAME USE, WHETHER THAT'S DAYCARE 
19:54:18 OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT, SO WE TRIED TO FIND A GOOD BALANCE BUT, YOU KNOW, AGAIN, LISTENING TO THE COMMERCIAL 
19:54:23 PROPERTY OWNERS AND THEIR CHALLENGES AND A FINDING  TENANTS.
SO I DON'T KNOW, DONOVAN, DO YOU HAVE 
19:54:31 ANYTHING YOU WANT TO ADD TO THAT?
>> THANK YOU, BILL.
THANK YOU, COUNCILMEMBER FOR THE 
19:54:38 QUESTION.
I WOULD SAY THAT THE BALANCE IS REALLY TRYING TO FIND, YOU KNOW, THE RIGHT 
19:54:47 MIX OF TENANTS, SO I THINK HAVING CONCERN THAT YOU WOULD HAVE A CONCENTRATION OF ONE PARTICULAR 
19:54:57 OCCUPIER OF A MAJOR MIXED USE PROJECT IS DEFINITELY A CONCERN.
BUT WHEN YOU HAVE THE RIGHT MEX, IT 
19:55:06  MIX, IT CAN ACTUALLY BE VERY COMPLEMENTARY.
FOR INSTANCE, YOU GO TO AN 
19:55:13 OPTOMETRIST'S OFFICE, AND AFTER YOUR EYE EXAMINATION, YOU PICK UP LUNCH.
SO THERE CAN ALSO BE A LOT OF SYNERGY 
19:55:24 BY HAVING THAT RIGHT  MIX.
SO IT'S REALLY DEFINITELY MORE OF AN ART THAN A HARD SCIENCE.

19:55:32 WHEN WE TOOK A LOOK AT THE DOWNTOWN ZONING, WE REALLY TRIED TO TAKE THAT APPROACH KNOWING THERE HAS BEEN A LOT 
19:55:38 OF CHANGE TO THE RETAIL ENVIRONMENT AND NOT JUST IN FREMONT, BUT EVERYWHERE, AND TRYING TO FIND THAT RIGHT BALANCE 
19:55:48 OF ALLOWING MORE USES TO GO INTO THE GROUND FLOOR BUT ALSO, YOU KNOW, ALLOWING FOR ENOUGH KIND OF DIVERSITY 
19:55:55 OF USES SO THAT YOU CAN GET THAT RIGHT MIX.
IN DOWNTOWN, WE REALLY HAVE ONE MIXED 
19:56:07 USE PROJECT THAT HAS BEEN DELIVERED ON THE CAPITOL AVENUE THOROUGHFARE WHICH IS REALLY THE CENTRAL RETAIL SPINE OF 
19:56:15 OUR DOWNTOWN, THERE HAVE BEEN TWO LEASES THAT HAVE BEEN EXECUTED FOR THAT PROJECT TO DATE AND THERE'S BEEN 
19:56:21 A LOT OF OTHER INTEREST FROM OTHER TENANTS, BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS THE FIRST TWO TENANTS TO SIGN AT THAT 
19:56:28 PROJECT ARE BOTH RESTAURANTS, AND SO INCLUDING ONE FULL SERVICE RESTAURANT, SLIVER PIZZERIA.

19:56:34 SO IT'S JUST A REALLY GOOD INDICATOR THAT THERE IS MOMENTUM HAPPENING DOWNTOWN, WE'RE HOPING THAT THIS 
19:56:43 UPDATE WILL PROVIDE EVEN MORE IMPETUS.
>> Councilmember Kassan: I  WANTED A MORE TECHNICAL ANSWER TO MY QUESTION 
19:56:50 OF WHAT -- BECAUSE YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU READ THE ORDINANCE AND YOU SEE WHAT'S STRUCK OUT AND WHAT'S LINED IN AND THE 
19:56:57 TABLES, IT'S A LITTLE HARD FOR SOMEONE WHO'S NOT, YOU KNOW, DEALING WITH THE ORDINANCE ON A DAY-TO-DAY BASIS TO 
19:57:01 EXACTLY UNDERSTAND WHAT THE CHANGES ARE.
SO I WAS JUST LOOKING FOR A MORE 
19:57:10 TECHNICAL RESPONSE TO MY QUESTION ABOUT LIKE WHAT EXACTLY IS CHANGING.
I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING ABOUT, 
19:57:17 OH, HAVING AN  OPTOMETRIST'S OFFICE NEXT DOOR TO A SANDWICH SHOP IS GREAT, BUT WHAT I WANT TO KNOW IS WHAT 
19:57:24 EXACTLY IS BEING ALLOWED, BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THAT THERE'S ANYTHING IN THERE THAT SAYS, LIKE, YOU CAN'T -- 
19:57:29 YOU KNOW, YOU CAN ONLY HAVE 25% OF THE STORES, YOU KNOW, BEING OFFICE SPACES.

19:57:34 I DON'T THINK SO.
I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING ABOUT  THAT.
SO I JUST WANT TO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT 
19:57:41 THESE CHANGES ARE THAT ARE BEING PROPOSED BECAUSE IT WASN'T CLEAR TO ME JUST FROM READING THE DOCUMENT THAT 
19:57:46 WAS SHARED.
>> ACTUALLY I THINK WE COULD SORT OF GO OVER THAT SECTION OF THE ORDINANCE 
19:57:55 TOGETHER BRIEFLY OR JUST HIGHLIGHT SOME PARTS OF IT.
SO I'LL SHARE MY SCREEN HERE.

19:58:00 SO THIS IS SECTION 18 AND THIS INCLUDES THAT TABLE AND THE DIFFERENT CHANGES TO THE DOWNTOWN ORDINANCE.

19:58:13 SORRY, I'M TRYING TO CLEAR MY SCREEN HERE.
SO ESSENTIALLY WHAT IT'S DOING I THINK 
19:58:19 IS REMOVING SOME OF THE HURDLES IN TERMS OF A ZONING ADMINISTRATOR PERMIT THAT WOULD REQUIRE A HEARING.

19:58:27 IF WE LOOKED AT INDOOR COMMERCIAL AND WE LOOK SPECIFICALLY AT THESE TWO DOWNTOWN DISTRICTS HERE, WE'RE 
19:58:33 REMOVING THAT REQUIREMENT.
SO IT'S BASICALLY PERMITTED BY RIGHT.
SO IT NOT THAT IT WASN'T PERMITTED 
19:58:39 BEFORE, BUT WE HAD MORE DISCRETION, I THINK WHAT WE WERE HEARING FROM THE COMMERCIAL PROPERTY OWNERS IS THAT 
19:58:44 THEIR LESSEES WERE WORRIED ABOUT HAVING THAT SORT OF UNKNOWN CONTINGENCY AND THAT UNCERTAINTY ABOUT WHETHER THEY 
19:58:53 WOULD GET APPROVAL.
CERTAINLY IT DOES, YOU KNOW, TO AN EXTENT REMOVE OUR ABILITY TO MAYBE 
19:58:58 LOOK AT OVERCONCENTRATION TO SOME EXTENT BUT WE'RE ALWAYS GOING TO BE LIMITED BY THE FINDINGS THAT ARE 
19:59:06 APPLICABLE TO A ZONING ADMINISTRATOR WHICH I DON'T HAVE IN FRONT OF ME BUT THEY'RE GENERALLY HEALTH SAFETY AND 
19:59:14 WELFARE RELATED CONSISTENT WITH POLICIES AND THINGS LIKE THAT.
SO I'D SAY THAT'S REALLY IT, IT'S NOT 
19:59:20 SORT OF THE HOME SCALE OPENING OF EVERYTHING ALLOWED EVERYWHERE, IT'S MORE REMOVING SOME OF THESE PERMIT 
19:59:30 REQUIREMENTS SUCH AS FOR RESTAURANTS THAT HAD HOUSING ABOVE.
I THINK THE LAST CODE UPDATE WE DID 
19:59:40 OVER A YEAR AGO, WE HAD THIS SORT OF RIGHT TO DOWNTOWN OR RIGHT TO URBAN USES WHERE WE WANTED TO, IN OUR CODE, 
19:59:45 EXPRESSED WE WANT TO HAVE AN ACTIVE DOWNTOWN AND THERE ARE GOING TO BE NOISES AND THINGS THAT COME WITH THAT 
19:59:52 KIND OF INCREASED ACTIVITY.
SO HERE WE HAD SOME SPECIFIC LIMITATIONS THAT IF YOU HAD -- IN A 
19:59:59 MIXED USE BUILDING HOUSING ABOVE A RESTAURANT THAT YOU NEEDED TO COME IN FOR A ZONING ADMINISTRATOR PERMITS, 
20:00:05 THAT'S AN ADDITIONAL HURDLE THAT WE GOT RID OF HERE OR ARE PROPOSING TO GET RID.

20:00:13 >> BILL, COULD YOU GO SPECIFICALLY TO THE SECTION WHERE IT LISTS A LOT OF THE MEDICAL OFFICE USES, JUST TO MAKE 
20:00:16 SURE WE'RE ADDRESSING THE COUNCILMEMBER'S QUESTION?
>> OKAY.

20:00:25 I THINK IT'S THESE TWO.
>> YEAH.
>> SO WITH REGARD TO OFFICES, THE ONE 
20:00:31 CHANGE WE'RE MAKING HERE IN ONE OF THE DOWNTOWN DISTRICTS IS RATHER THAN REQUIRING TO BE ON THE UPPER FLOOR 
20:00:37 ONLY, OR UFO, THAT IT COULD BE PERMITTED ON THE GROUND FLOOR.
SO THAT'S A CHANGE TO ONE DISTRICT.

20:00:44 I DON'T KNOW IF THAT ANSWERS THE QUESTION.
>> Councilmember Kassan: UNDER 
20:00:55 SERVICES, IT LOOKS LIKE PERSONAL SERVICES, EMPLOYMENT SERVICES ARE ALL PERMITTED.

20:01:05 YEAH, I'M JUST -- I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THIS.
THIS IS A PRETTY MAJOR CHANGE.

20:01:11 I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND THAT THE DEVELOPERS WANT MORE FLEXIBILITY AND THEY'RE HAVING TROUBLE ATTRACTING 
20:01:22 RETAIL USES AND I'M REALLY GLAD TO HEAR THAT THERE ARE SOME RESTAURANT USES GOING IN DOWNTOWN, BUT THIS IS JUST 
20:01:27 WIDE OPEN.
THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NOTHING I CAN SEE ABOUT HAVING IT BE MORE OF A MIX.

20:01:38 IT COULD BE NOTHING BUT OFFICES, YOU KNOW, AND IT JUST KILLS OUR CHANCE OF HAVING A ROCK RIDGE OR A -- YOU KNOW, 
20:01:44 A MONTCLAIRE OR DOWNTOWN MOUNTAIN VIEW OR WHATEVER.
WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE JUST 
20:01:50 REALLY -- IT'S ONE OF THE TOP COMPLAINTS I HEAR ABOUT FREMONT, THERE'S NO PLACE TO GO, THERE'S 
20:02:00 NOTHING TO DO.
SO I'M NOT IN FAVOR OF THIS.
>> AND COUNCILMEMBER, ONE OTHER JUST 
20:02:08 OBSERVATION.
IT'S VERY COMMON IN LEASE AGREEMENTS TO HAVE EXCLUSIONS TO A PARTICULAR 
20:02:16 USE.
SO FOR INSTANCE, IF ONE DENTAL OFFICE WERE TO SIGN A LEASE WITH A PARTICULAR 
20:02:25 PROJECT, SAY IN THIS CASE CAPITOL SQUARE, WHICH IS TWO LINEAR BLOCKS OF GROUND FLOOR RETAIL, THAT LANDLORD IS 
20:02:32 TYPICALLY GOING TO BE PROHIBITED FROM LEASING TO ANOTHER SIMILAR USE.
>> Councilmember Kassan: RIGHT.

20:02:41 >> SO WE DO GET A LITTLE BIT OF VARIATION KIND OF NATURALLY THERE, AND I THINK IT IS, AGAIN, JUST THAT 
20:02:52 CHALLENGE OF TRYING TO FIND THAT BALANCING ACT BETWEEN HELPING TO FILL FIRST GENERATION VACANT SPACES AND --

20:02:57 >> Councilmember Kassan: I DON'T SEE THIS AS A BALANCE, THOUGH, I SEE THIS AS TOTALLY BENDING OVER TO THE DEMANDS 
20:03:04 OF THE  DEVELOPERS.
SO I THINK A BALANCE WOULD BE SOMETHING WHERE LIKE MAYBE 25% COULD 
20:03:11 BE OFFICES OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
SO -- I'M DEFINITELY NOT IN FAVOR OF THIS.

20:03:19 I THINK THIS COULD BE THE -- AND I KNOW -- YOU KNOW, I'M TOTALLY SYMPATHETIC THAT RETAIL IS HARD RIGHT NOW, BUT I 
20:03:24 ALSO KNOW THAT HUMAN BEINGS LIKE TO GO OUT AND WALK AND SEE INTERESTING THINGS.

20:03:30 I MEAN, JUST LOOK AT THE OTHER NEIGHBORHOOD COMMERCIAL DISTRICTS IN THE BAY AREA THAT ARE VIBRANT.

20:03:36 PEOPLE COME FROM ALL OVER THE BAY AREA TO GO TO THOSE PLACES AND I HONESTLY BELIEVE THAT GIVEN OUR HISTORIC 
20:03:41 DOWNTOWNS, WE HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO HAVE THAT.
AND THIS IS BASICALLY ENSURING THAT WE 
20:03:53 WILL NEVER HAVE THAT.
>> YEAH, I MEAN, I WOULD ADD, WE DO, I THINK WITH THE LOCALE PROJECTS HAVE A 
20:03:57 CERTAIN RANGE OF USES THAT ARE ALLOWED THERE AND WE COULD CERTAINLY DO THAT ON A KIND OF PROJECT BY PROJECT 
20:04:06  BASIS AS WELL AND THAT MAY BE SIMILAR TO SANTANA ROW WHERE THEY HAVE REQUIREMENT FOR CERTAIN TYPE OF USES 
20:04:10 IN SAN JOSÉ FOR THAT KIND OF A DEVELOPMENT.
BUT IN TERMS OF THE WHOLE DISTRICT, 
20:04:15 CERTAINLY POINTS WELL TAKEN.
>> Councilmember Kassan: BUT I DON'T SEE HOW WE COULD DO THAT IF THOSE USES 
20:04:20 ARE PERMITTED BY RIGHT, I DON'T SEE HOW WE COULD SAY WELL, IN THIS PROJECT, YOU CAN'T DO IT.

20:04:25 THEY WOULD SUE US.
>> WELL, IT WOULD BE IN A SITUATION IF IT WAS A PLANNED DISTRICT.

20:04:29 BUT DEFINITELY POINT WELL TAKEN.
I MEAN, IF WE WANTED TO IMPLEMENT SOMETHING LIKE THAT, WE WOULD MAYBE 
20:04:36 LOOK AT A CERTAIN NUMBER OF TYPE OF USE WITHIN A CERTAIN RADIUS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

20:04:42 WE COULD DO SOMETHING ALONG THOSE LINES AND WE DISCUSSED THAT.
IT JUST WASN'T IMMEDIATELY  CLEAR, I 
20:04:47 THINK WITHOUT FURTHER STUDY TO FIGURE OUT EXACTLY WHAT THE RIGHT MIX WAS.
AND I THINK WHEN WE TALK TO THOSE 
20:04:56 COMMERCIAL PROPERTY  OWNERS, AT LEAST THEY FELT THAT THEY -- THEY OBVIOUSLY HAD THEIR POSITION ON THIS, BUT --

20:05:04 >> Councilmember Kassan: THEY WANT TO MAKE MONEY.
>> IT A CHALLENGING TIME AND WE DID 
20:05:11 WORK WITH A RETAIL CONSULTANT FOR THE CONNOLLY CENTER BACK YEARS AGO, AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HE TOLD STAFF 
20:05:19 IS THAT AS PLANNERS, WE OFTEN LOOK TO CREATE MIXED USE PROJECTS WHEREVER WE CAN AND THERE'S NOT ALWAYS THE DEMAND 
20:05:25 FOR IT OR IT'S NOT ALWAYS AN AREA THAT WAS GOING TO BRING IN THOSE RETAILERS.

20:05:30 SO IT IS ALWAYS A BALANCE.
>> Councilmember Kassan: I'M REALLY DISAPPOINTED THAT THIS IS KIND OF 
20:05:40 BURIED IN A WHOLE BUNCH OF AMENDMENTS TO THE ZONING ORDINANCE.
I DON'T THINK THIS IS ADEQUATELY 
20:05:47 NOTICED TO THE PUBLIC THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING THAT IS A MAJOR CHANGE FOR OUR CITY.

20:05:51 ANYONE WHO WOULD HAVE LOOKED AT THIS ITEM WOULDN'T HAVE EVEN KNOWN THAT THAT WAS WHAT WAS HAPPENING UNLESS 
20:05:58 THEY WERE, YOU KNOW, KNEW A LOT ABOUT CITY PLANNING AND I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE DISCUSSED 
20:06:01 WITH THE PUBLIC.
WE NEED TO HAVE PUBLIC MEETINGS ABOUT THIS.

20:06:09 I KNOW THAT PALO ALTO HAS HAD LOTS AND LOTS OF DEBATES ABOUT THIS ISSUE, PRESERVING RETAIL.

20:06:16 I JUST -- I DON'T THINK IT RIGHT THAT WE'RE JUST SNEAKING THIS IN WITH A BUNCH OF OTHER, LIKE, MINOR KIND OF 
20:06:24 ADMINISTRATIVE CHANGES TO BRING THINGS IN TO COMPLIANCE WITH VARIOUS LAWS.
I'M NOT HAPPY WITH THIS, WITH THE WAY 
20:06:32 THIS IS BEING DONE AT ALL.
>> City Manager Danaj:COUNCILME MBER KASSAN AND MAYOR, IF I COULD SUGGEST 
20:06:38 AFTER WE'VE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO HEAR FROM OTHER COUNCILMEMBERS, PERHAPS WE CAN MAKE A DECISION THAT WE SHOULD 
20:06:43 DEFER THIS ITEM AND COME BACK IN A MORE RESPONSIVE WAY TO SOME OF YOUR QUESTIONS.

20:06:50 BUT LET ME ALSO LET DAN SPEAK.
GO AHEAD.
>> Mayor Mei: DAN, DID YOU HAVE 
20:06:56 COMMENTS?
I'M SORRY, I SEE YOUR MIC IS  OFF.
>> Mr. Schoenholz: I BASICALLY WAS 
20:07:02 GOING TO SAY SOMETHING LIKE THE CITY MANAGER.
>> City Manager Danaj: OKAY.

20:07:09 >> Mayor Mei: I HAD ONE COMMENT BECAUSE I KNOW THAT, BILL, YOU HAD MENTIONED -- PLANNER ROTH, YOU HAD MENTIONED THE 
20:07:14 CONNOLLY PROJECT, AND ONE OF MY OBSERVATIONS, BECAUSE I THINK WHEN THAT WAS BUILT OR APPROVED, THAT WAS 
20:07:22 WITH THE WHOLE IDEA OF THE WORK-LIVE UNITS, AND WHAT I CAN SEE, BECAUSE I DO THIS IN A LOT OF OUR PROJECTS, BOTH 
20:07:32  BEFORE, DURING AND AFTER, THAT ONE IS NOT DOING ANY WORK AS FAR AS I CAN SEE, THAT'S MY CONCERN SOMETIMES WITH 
20:07:37 THOSE AS WELL AS WITH THE ARTIST'S WALK.
WHY DO WE APPROVE RETAIL AND HAVE THE 
20:07:41 ONLY ENTRANCE BEING ON THE INSIDE AND THE VERY STREET FRONT IS NOT BEING ENFORCED?

20:07:48 IS THERE ANYTHING WE CAN DO IF WE'RE GOING TO GO BACK AND LOOK AT THIS TO ALSO CALL TO QUESTION THAT -- I MEAN, 
20:07:53 THE WHOLE IDEA OF HAVING WALKABLE DISTRICTS AND RETAIL IS THAT THEY WERE  APPROVED WITH THE IDEA THAT THE 
20:08:00 STOREFRONT WOULD BE IDEALLY ON THE FRONT OF THE ROAD, ALSO AVAILABLE AND HAVING IT NOT OPEN DOESN'T MAKE IT 
20:08:09 VERY WALKABLE.
SO THAT'S A CONCERN FOR ME AND SOME OF THE RESTAURANTS THAT WE SEE.

20:08:20 IF THEY HAVE A STOREFRONT ON THE MAIN ROAD, THEY SHOULD BE OPEN.
>> I AGREE.

20:08:25 IT'S A CHALLENGE, THE DEVELOPER COMES BACK AND THEY'VE HAD DIFFICULTY FILLING THOSE SPACES.

20:08:30 WE DO HAVE CONDITIONS OF APPROVAL RELATED TO THOSE  LIVE-WORK IN TERMS OF KEEPING CURTAINS UP AND HAVING 
20:08:35 SIGNAGE AND THINGS LIKE THAT, SO THAT IT AT LEAST GIVES THE SENSE OF A RETAIL ENVIRONMENT.

20:08:41 BUT WE CAN'T FORCE THEM, YOU KNOW, TO PUT A PARTICULAR TENANT IN THERE.
WE HAVE A RANGE OF USES THAT ARE 
20:08:51 ALLOWED AND THAT'S AGREE THERE ARE SHORTCOMINGS, WE CAN'T FORCE TENANTS TO COME.

20:08:56 >> Mayor Mei: IT LOOKS LIKE  LIVE-LIVE FROM WHAT I CAN SEE WALKING ALONG THERE, I DON'T SEE ANY OF THE 
20:09:01 BUSINESSES THEMSELVES THERE.
I COULD BE WRONG AND PERHAPS NOT PAYING ENOUGH ATTENTION, BUT  DAN, DO 
20:09:07 YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS ON THAT?
BECAUSE THAT'S ALSO A COMMENT I HAVE WHEN WE LOOK AT OUR CENTERVILLE 
20:09:12 COMPLETE STREETS, I KNOW HANS WAS ON HERE EARLIER, THAT'S A CONCERN I HAVE AND I'VE CITED THAT BEFORE ESPECIALLY 
20:09:20 FOR ARTIST'S WALK AND SOME OTHER PLACES, THE COMBINATION IS RETAIL, AND SOME DO A LOVELY JOB, I KNOW SOME HAVE 
20:09:27 PATIOS AND DIFFERENT SEATING AREAS, BUT SOME SEEM TO REALLY STRUGGLE IN TERMS OF -- AND DONOVAN, YOU AND I HAVE HAD 
20:09:36 THIS CONVERSATION BEFORE TOO.
SO IF THERE'S NO OTHER COMMENTS, I SEE ALSO COUNCILMEMBER COX?

20:09:41 >> Councilmember Cox: THANK YOU, MAYOR MEI.
I'M JUST WONDERING, THIS IS MY FIRST 
20:09:52 TIME SEEING THIS PROJECT, AND THE AMENDMENTS THAT ARE BEING CHANGED.
WHEN THIS WAS DONE, WAS THERE SOME 
20:10:01 SORT OF MODEL OR SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE KIND OF FOLLOWING TO HAVE MADE THESE AMENDMENTS TO THE ZONING?

20:10:10 I'M JUST TRYING TO SEE WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ENVISION FREMONT TO BE FROM 20 YEARS AGO TO NOW.

20:10:20 I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS KIND OF THE THOUGHT PROCESS AND HOW MUCH INPUT WAS PROVIDED INTO THIS 
20:10:29 REVIEW.
THIS ZONING AND PLANNING REVIEW.
>> SPECIFIC TO THE DOWNTOWN OR ALL OF 
20:10:36 IT???
>> Councilmember Cox: THIS WHOLE THING, I WANTED TO UNDERSTAND WHERE 
20:10:44 WAS THE INPUT COMING FROM, AND WAS IT FROM DIFFERENT GROUPS OF PEOPLE OR TO PROVIDE THE INPUT SO YOU MADE THESE 
20:10:48 CHANGES.
I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND, HOW DID THESE CHANGES COME  ABOUT?

20:11:00 WERE SOME OF THEM REGULATIONS OR SOME WAS DEVELOPERS OR SOME WAS INCREASING THE MARKETABILITY TO ALLOW A DIFFERENT 
20:11:08 MIX OF RESIDENTIAL AND BUSINESSES TO COME TOGETHER.
>> THERE ARE MANY CHANGES IN THE BIG 
20:11:17  PACKAGE TONIGHT, SO THERE'S A TABLE IN THE STAFF REPORT THAT TRIES TO GIVE KIND OF A BRIEF EXPLANATION OF THE 
20:11:20 REASON BEHIND THEM.
A LOT OF THEM ARE BASED ON CHANGES AT THE STATE LEVEL, WHETHER THAT'S 
20:11:29 REQUIREMENTS IN TERMS OF DENSITY BONUS FOR STUDENT HOUSING OR ASSISTED  LIVING REQUIREMENT, THE REQUIREMENTS 
20:11:35 THAT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING BE ALLOWED IN ALL DISTRICTS, THAT MULTIFAMILY AND RESIDENTIAL ARE ALLOWED.

20:11:41 THOSE ARE THINGS DONE AT THE STATE LEVEL AND THEN LOCAL JURISDICTIONS NEED TO UPDATE THEIR CODE TO BE 
20:11:49 CONSISTENT WITH THAT.
SOMETHING LIKE THE URBAN -- THE URBAN FARMING ORDINANCE, YOU KNOW, THAT'S 
20:11:54 THROUGH I GUESS STAFF'S EXPERIENCE OR OTHER STAFF'S EXPERIENCE AND POTENTIAL APPLICANTS THAT WOULD LIKE TO DO THAT, 
20:12:01 MAYBE LOOKING AT EXAMPLES FROM OTHER CITIES LIKE BERKELEY, FOR EXAMPLE.
SEEING THAT AS MAYBE BEING SOMETHING 
20:12:05 THAT WOULD BE AN IMPROVEMENT TO THE COMMUNITY AND TRY AND MAKE THAT VAINL.

20:12:11  AVAILABLE.
SO THAT REALLY IS ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS.

20:12:16 WITH THE CHANGES TO THE  DOWNTOWN, AGAIN, WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE THAT A MORE STREAMLINED PROCESS RATHER THAN, 
20:12:26 YOU KNOW, A WHOLE SCALE CHANGE.
HOWEVER, THAT COMES FROM COORDINATION WITH ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, COMING TO 
20:12:34 PLANNING AND I THINK OBSERVING THAT THERE ARE VACANT TENANT SPACES AND CONNECTING US WITH PROPERTY OWNERS AND 
20:12:44 HAVING CONVERSATIONS, I THINK THAT'S SIGNIFICANT TO THAT CHANGE.
>> Mr. Pullen: IF I CAN FOLLOW UP A 
20:12:53 LITTLE BIT, ONE OF THE THINGS WE'VE DONE WELL IN THE PAST TWO YEARS IS WE HAVE KIND OF -- WITHIN PLANNING, 
20:13:00 PEOPLE PROCESSING APPLICATIONS, WE HAVE SOME FOLKS WHO ARE MORE FOCUSED ON LONG TERM UPDATES TO OUR CODES.

20:13:09 AND LOOKING AT MARKET TRENDS, LOOKING AT CODES THAT WE'RE IMPLEMENTING THAT AREN'T REALLY AS CONSISTENT AS WE'D 
20:13:15 LIKE THEM TO BE, WE HAVE A FEEDBACK MECHANISM THAT LEADS INTO THIS CODE AMENDMENT ITEM  PERIODICALLY.

20:13:22 AND SOMETIMES THAT'S INTERNAL, SOMETIMES THAT'S EXTERNAL, BUT THEY ALL GET PACKAGED TOGETHER BECAUSE 
20:13:31 THEY'RE NOT REALLY ON ONE THEME.
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO THIS ITEM, THERE IS KIND OF A LARGE CONVERSATION 
20:13:38 BREWING THAT I THINK THE LEAGUE HAS ADDRESSED IN RECENT MEETINGS, THE AMERICAN PLANNING ASSOCIATION IS ALSO 
20:13:45  LOOKING AT.
THERE ARE A LOT OF CONVERSATIONS ABOUT WHAT DOES THE POST COVID ECONOMY LOOK 
20:13:53 LIKE, WHAT USES ARE GOING TO SURVIVE AND THRIVE, WHAT MIX IS GOING TO BE APPROPRIATE, AND THIS CONVERSATION IS 
20:14:00 REFRESHING BECAUSE WE'VE HAD A LOT OF THESE SAME CONVERSATIONS WITHIN OUR STAFF MEETINGS ABOUT MAINTAINING THE 
20:14:09 VIBRANCY IN OUR CITY BUT THE SAME TIME FILLING VACANT SPACES.
SO THIS IS A GOOD CONVERSATION, THIS 
20:14:18 IS -- TO MARK AND DAN'S POINT, WE WANT TO CHECK IN WITH YOU AND SEE WHERE YOU ARE AND SEE WHERE THAT GOES IN TERMS 
20:14:25 OF LOOKING AT THIS IN A BALANCED WAY, NOT JUST IN THE DOWNTOWN BUT ALSO CITYWIDE.

20:14:31 THE DOWNTOWN IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN, LET'S SAY, NILES OR CENTERVILLE, VERY DIFFERENT THAN PACIFIC COMMONS, FOR 
20:14:36 EXAMPLE.
SO I JUST WANT TO PROVIDE A LIT LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND ON THE QUESTION YOU 
20:14:42 HAD OF BILL BUT ALSO THE LARGER IMPETUS FOR THIS ITEM.
>> Mayor Mei: SO I THINK WE'RE HEARING 
20:14:47 THAT WE'D LIKE TO PULL THIS ITEM FOR THIS EVENING AND TO COME BACK ONCE WE ARE ABLE TO HAVE FURTHER DISCUSSION 
20:14:54 AND THEN I KNOW THAT THIS ALSO WAS HEARD BY THE PLANNING COMMISSION IN MARCH, AND SO I DON'T KNOW IF ANYONE 
20:15:03 HAS LOOKED AT THAT SPECIFICALLY.
>> Councilmember Cox: I DIDN'T FINISH WITH MY QUESTION THOUGH.

20:15:06 >> Mayor Mei: OKAY.
>> Councilmember Cox: I WANTED TO ALSO ADD IN THAT WHEN I LOOK AT THESE 
20:15:20 SUMMARY TABLES, IT WOULD HELP ME TO UNDERSTAND -- ADD A COLUMN SAYING THIS WAS REQUIRED BY LAW, OR WHAT WAS THE 
20:15:28 MAXIMUM ALLOWED BY LAW, BECAUSE TO JUST HAVE PERCENTAGES FOR CERTAIN TARGET GROUPS AND BONUS GRANTED, IT DOESN'T 
20:15:36 MEAN ANYTHING, AT LEAST IN MY INTERPRETATION, OF SAYING WHAT IS REQUIRED, WHAT IS NOT REQUIRED BY THE 
20:15:43 LAW SO WE ARE IN COMPLIANCE THERE, AND USING THAT AS A MEASURING STICK OF WHAT WE HAVE A RANGE TO MAKE A 
20:15:47 DECISION ON.
THAT WOULD AT LEAST, IN MY OPINION, WOULD HELP TO DISTINGUISH THESE 
20:15:55 DIFFERENT TYPES OF CHANGES.
BECAUSE I WANT TO KNOW, SOME ARE MANDATORY AND IN COMPLIANCE OR IT'S 
20:16:10 NICE TO HAVE OR THIS IS PART OF OUR DREAM LIST THAT WOULD BE SUGGESTED BUT IS NOT A NECESSITY.

20:16:16 >> City Manager Danaj: SO MAYOR, MY SUGGESTION IS TO DEFER THE ITEM, BUT WITHOUT TRYING TO ECK TEND THE 
20:16:25  EXTEND THE CONVERSATION, IF THERE ARE ANY OTHER OPINIONS OR VOICES HAVEN'T HEARD, I THINK IT WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR 
20:16:28 STAFF AND MYSELF TO HEAR THEM.
>> Mayor Mei: I WAS TRYING TO GET TO THAT.

20:16:35 I SEE COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN, I DON'T THINK YOU'VE SPOKEN ON THIS ITEM YET, AND THEN COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN AGAIN.

20:16:39 >> Councilmember Salwan: I THINK I'LL TAKE THE CITY MANAGER'S SUGGESTION.
I KIND OF SEE THIS AS A TWO STEP EVERY 
20:16:46 COUPLE YEARS WE DO  CLEAN-UP, THERE'S NEW CODES, NEW LEGISLATION, SOME STUFF THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE ANYMORE AND 
20:16:49 THEN THE OTHER PARTS, ZONING ISSUES THAT MAYBE WE NEED A FURTHER CONVERSATION.

20:16:56 SO I WAS GOING TO SUGGEST THAT EITHER WE SEPARATE INTO TWO PARTS.
IF WE CAN'T, WE CAN BRING THE WHOLE 
20:17:02 THING BACK TOGETHER.
I DON'T KNOW IF THE CITY MANAGER AND MR. PULLEN WANT TO COMMENT ON THAT, IF 
20:17:09 THAT'S POSSIBLE OR SHOULD WE JUST --
>> Mr. Pullen: DEFERRING TO  MARK'S DECISION AS A WHOLE, WHAT I HEARD 
20:17:18 PRIMARILY WAS THAT THE DOWNTOWN CODE ISSUES WERE MOST WANTING TO BE DISCUSSED, AND THE REST, I DIDN'T HEAR 
20:17:27 A LOT OF BACK AND FORTH.
THERE WAS THE QUESTION FROM COUNCILMEMBER COX ON THE DENSITY 
20:17:33 BONUS, BACK AT PAGE 136 THAT LINKS TO THAT GOVERNMENT CODE SECTION THAT CHANGED, TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION.

20:17:41 SO I THINK WHAT I HEARD WAS THIS IS ABOUT PRIMARILY THE DOWNTOWN ZONING.
>> City Manager Danaj: TO THE EXTENT 
20:17:51 THAT THAT'S THE WILL OF THE COUNCIL AND A MOTION CAN BE STRUCTURED THAT CAN MAKE THAT HAPPEN, WE'RE OPEN TO THAT.

20:17:53 >> Mayor Mei: OKAY.
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, DID YOU HAVE ANOTHER COMMENT.

20:18:00 I SEE YOUR HAND IS RAISED.
>> Councilmember Kassan: YES, WHAT COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN SAID IS EXACTLY 
20:18:07 THAT I WAS GOING TO SUGGEST, THAT WE SPLIT IT OUT, BECAUSE I THINK A LOT OF CHANGES THAT ARE SUGGESTED ARE VERY 
20:18:12 STRAIGHTFORWARD TO BRING US INTO COMPLIANCE WITH LAW, SO IF WE COULD JUST TAKE OUT THE ONES THAT RELATE TO 
20:18:20 GROUND FLOOR USES IN DOWNTOWN, YOU KNOW, COMMERCIAL CORRIDORS AND LEAVE EVERYTHING ELSE, HOPEFULLY WE COULD -- 
20:18:26 BECAUSE I DO BELIEVE THAT THAT IS GOING TO REQUIRE SOME COMMUNITY MEETINGS AND DISCUSSION, I DO BELIEVE IT'S A BIG 
20:18:34 DECISION AND I DON'T WANT TO HOLD UP THE MORE ADMINISTRATIVE PIECES.
>> Mayor Mei: WITH THAT BEING SAID, 
20:18:39 CAN I GET A MOTION AND A SECOND?
MOTION BY COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN, SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER KENG.

20:18:47 >> Councilmember Salwan: I'D JUST LIKE TO MAKE A MOTION TO ACCEPT STAFF RECOMMENDATION WITH THE EXCEPTION OF 
20:18:58 DOWNTOWN BOTTOM FLOOR DISCUSSION ABOUT RETAIL AND ALL IT ENCOMPASSES.
>> Mayor Mei: A MOTION, A SECOND.

20:19:11 ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE.
>> Ms. Gauthier: YES, MADAME MAYOR.
COUNCILMEMBER COX?

20:19:17 >> Mayor Mei: COUNCILMEMBER COX?
I'M SORRY.
>> Councilmember Cox: AYE.

20:19:21 >> Ms. Gauthier: COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN, AYE.
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, AYE.

20:19:28 COUNCILMEMBER JONES, AYE.
COUNCILMEMBER KENG, AYE.
VICE MAYOR SHAO, AYE.

20:19:36 MAYOR MEI, AYE.
>> Mayor Mei: SO THE ITEM PASSES WITH THE MOTION THAT'S BEING MADE AND WE 
20:19:42 WILL HAVE A FURTHER DISCUSSION ON THE DOWNTOWN AND THE RETAIL AREA.
NEXT IS OUR WASHINGTON HOSPITAL 
20:19:48 COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT.
I WANTED TO BE CONSCIENTIOUS OF THE TIME BECAUSE OUR STENOCAPTIONER NEEDS 
20:19:55 A BREAK AT 8:30.
AND SO I HAVE A FEELING THAT UNFORTUNATELY THIS CONVERSATION AND 
20:19:59 PRESENTATION, BECAUSE IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO HAVE A DISCUSSION ABOUT OUR COMMUNITY NEEDS HEALTH ASSESSMENT, 
20:20:07 ESPECIALLY IN THIS PERIOD OF TIME, SO I'M GOING TO ASK US THAT WE TAKE A BREAK FOR NEXT -- WE'LL MAKE IT 10 
20:20:12 MINUTES AND COME BACK AT 8:30.
SO TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE FULL DISCUSSION ON THE HEALTH NEEDS OF OUR 
20:20:16 COMMUNITY.
THANK YOU.
SO DURING THIS BREAK, PLEASE TURN OFF 
20:30:17 YOUR VIDEO AND MIC.
[RECESS]
>> Mayor Mei: COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, 
20:30:19 ARE YOU THERE?
>> Councilmember Kassan: I AM.
>> Mayor Mei: GREAT.

20:30:25 THANK YOU.
I'D LIKE TO BRING THE MEETING BACK TO ITEM 7A, WHICH IS WASHINGTON 
20:30:32 HEALTHCARE, HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS, AND WE'D LIKE TO WELCOME THEIR OUTREACH MANAGER LUCY HERNANDEZ.

20:30:34 WELCOME.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE THIS EVENING.

20:30:41 >> THANK YOU.
AM I ABLE TO SHARE MY SCREEN?
PERFECT.

20:31:17 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
>> OKAY, GREAT.
THERE WE GO.

20:31:21 GOOD EVENING, MAYOR MEI, CITY COUNCIL, STAFF, MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC.
I AM LUCY HERNANDEZ.

20:31:26 I AM THE COMMUNITY OUTREACH MANAGER FOR WASHINGTON HONT.
I AM RESPONSIBLE FOR OUR COMMUNITY 
20:31:32 ENGAGEMENT PROGRAMS, THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR HEALTH AND WELLNESS PROGRAMMING AND THE COORDINATION OF OUR COMMUNITY 
20:31:41 SCREENING HEALTH FAIRS.
THIS EVENING WE WILL REVIEW THE 2020 COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT.

20:31:46 EVERY THREE YEARS, WE CONDUCT THE COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT.
THIS SURVEY IS ACHIEVED THROUGH DATA 
20:31:51 REPORTS, MEETINGS WITH FOCUS GROUPS, IN ADDITION TO INTERVIEWING HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS.

20:32:00 WE ARE PLEASED TO NOTE THAT WE VOLUNTARILY CONDUCT THESE SURVEYS FOR OVER 20 YEARS AS WE BELIEVE IT IS A 
20:32:05 TOP PRIORITY TO UNDERSTAND THE NEEDS OF OUR RESIDENT.
THIS ENDEAVOR ALLOWS US TO SELECT 
20:32:08 TOPICS FOR COMMUNITY  OUTREACH AS WELL AS CREATING SPECIAL CLINICAL PROGRAMS.

20:32:17 BEFORE I JUMP INTO THE 2020 COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT, I'D LIKE TO QUICKLY HIGHLIGHT A FEW KEY 
20:32:23 INITIATIVES WE ACCOMPLISH THROUGH TARGETED PROGRAMS AND COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS FROM OUR PREVIOUS 
20:32:28 REPORT.
FOUR YEARS AGO, WE LEARNED ASTHMA, BEHAVIORAL HEALTH, CARDIOVASCULAR 
20:32:37 DISEASE, STROKE, OBESITY, DIABETES, HEALTHY LIVING AND ACTIVE LIVING WERE TOP HEALTH NEEDS IN FREMONT.

20:32:42 WE LEARNED FROM COMMUNITY  MEMBERS CHILDHOOD ASTHMA WAS A HEALTH CONCERN AND TO ADDRESS THIS, WASHINGTON 
20:32:48 HOSPITAL PARTNERED WITH UCSF HEALTH TO ESTABLISH A PEDIATRIC ASTHMA PROTOCOL.

20:32:54 WE ALSO LEARNED FOUR YEARS AGO THAT COMMUNITY MEMBERS DID NOT SEE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AS A COMMUNITY 
20:33:00 HEALTH CONCERN AND IN RESPONSE TO THIS, WE INCREASED COMMUNITY AWARENESS THROUGH COMPREHENSIVE EDUCATION SERIES 
20:33:10 WITH MENTAL HEALTH EXPERTS AND FEATURED MENTAL HEALTH TOPICS ON BAY AREA HEALTHY TOGETHER.

20:33:14 STROKE RATES WERE HIGH IN FREMONT AND TO ADDRESS THIS, WE INCREASED COMMUNITY EDUCATION WITH ONLINE 
20:33:24 RESOURCES AND PROVIDED EDUCATION AROUND STROKE PREVENTION AND LIVING WITH LIFE AFTER A STROKE.

20:33:32 THE HOSPITAL ALSO CONTINUED OUR ANNUAL CARDIOVASCULAR SCREENING EVENTS.
AND IN RESPONSE TO A HIGH PREVALENCE 
20:33:40 OF DIABETES, ALERT DAY SCREENING EVENTS RAISE THE AWARENESS ALONG WITH PREVENTION EDUCATION.

20:33:50 AGAIN THAT WAS JUST A FEW KEY INITIATIVES THAT WE ACCOMPLISHED FROM THE PREVIOUS REPORT.

20:33:56 A COMPREHENSIVE SUMMARY IS AVAILABLE IN THE LATEST ASSESSMENT.
NOW I WILL BE DIVING INTO THE TOP 
20:34:01 HEALTH NEEDS IDENTIFIED IN THE WASHINGTON TOWNSHIP HEALTHCARE DISTRICT, AND THEY ARE HEART DISEASE, 
20:34:09 HYPERTENSION, STROKE AND DIABETES, RESPIRATORY HEALTH, BEHAVIORAL HEALTH, HEALTHY EATING/ACTIVE LIVING, HOUSING 
20:34:18 AND HOMELESSNESS AND SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH.
IN THIS BUSY SLIDE, I AGGREGATED THE 
20:34:23 DISEASE INCIDENCE DATA.
THIS CHART SHOWS THE PREVALENCE OF THE CONDITION IN THE CITY IN COMPARISON TO 
20:34:30 ALAMEDA COUNTY AVERAGE.
IN FREMONT, THE INCIDENCE OF ALL 25 DISEASE MEASURES IS BELOW THE COUNTY 
20:34:39 AVERAGE.
THAT BEING SAID, THE INCIDENCE OF CARDIAC RELATED CONDITIONS IS STILL 
20:34:46 NEAR THE COUNTY AVERAGE ALONG WITH ASTHMA AND DIABETES.
POINTING TO THE RIGHT IN THIS CHART 
20:34:56 SHOWS DISEASE IS GREATER PREVALENCE IN THE COUNTY AND OUR NEIGHBORS IN NEWARK HAVE A DISPROPORTIONATE INCIDENCE OF 
20:35:02  CO PD AND STROKE AND ALSO MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS REQUIRING E.D. VISITS.

20:35:12 THIS CHART HIGHLIGHTS THE POPULATION OF UNION CITY HAS A HIGH INCIDENCE OF  CARDIAC-RELATED CONDITIONS, E.D. 
20:35:16 VISITS FOR COPD, DIABETES, HYPERTENSION, AND THAT'S JUST TO NAME A FEW.

20:35:24 AND THAT'S OUR NEIGHBORS IN UNION CITY.
HEART DISEASE IS AMONG THE LEADING 
20:35:30 CAUSES OF DEATH NATIONWIDE.
THE RATES OF E.D. VISITS AND HOSPITALIZATIONS FOR HEART DISEASE ARE 
20:35:40 LOWER THAN THE COUNTY AS WELL AS CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE.
THERE WAS -- THE RATES FOR CONGESTIVE 
20:35:51 HEART FAILURE HOSPITALIZATION WAS LOWER THAN THE COUNTY IN ALL THREE CITIES.
HEART DISEASE MORTALITY IMPROVED AS IT 
20:35:57 DID NOT COUNTY AS WELL.
THE RATES FOR E.D. VISITS IN HOSPITALIZATION FOR HEIGHT RETENTION 
20:36:03 WHICH IS BLOOD PRESSURE ARE LOWER THAN THE COUNTY IN FREMONT HOWEVER I INCLUDED A SLIDE WITH TREND DATA OF 
20:36:09 THE WASHINGTON HOSPITAL E.D. VISITS FOR HYPERTENSION, AND THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT UP WARD TREND FROM FISCAL 
20:36:22 YEAR 2018 THROUGH FISCAL YEAR 2020 IN ALL THREE CITIES.
HYPERTENSION MORTALITY RATE HAS 
20:36:26 IMPROVED IN FREMONT AS DID IN THE COUNTY.
AND THAT'S JUST THE MORTALITY RATE.

20:36:35 THE RATES OF E.D. VISITS AND HOSPITALIZATION FOR STROKE ARE LOWER THAN THE COUNTY AND STROKE MORTALITY 
20:36:45 RATE IN ALL THREE  CITIES HAS IMPROVED AS DID IN THE COUNTY.
THE RATES OF E.D. VISITS AND 
20:36:56 HOSPITALIZATION FOR DIABETES ARE LOWER THAN THE COUNTY.
AS YOU CAN SEE OUR NEIGHBORS, THE 
20:37:02 RATES ARE HIGHER.
THIS SHOWS THE RATES OF ASTHMA AND COPD-RELATED EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT 
20:37:10  VISITS AND HOSPITALIZATIONS ARE ALSO LOWER THAN THE COUNTY.
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH IS A HIGH PRIORITY 
20:37:15 IN OUR COMMUNITY.
ALTHOUGH SUICIDE RATES OF ALL THREE CITIES ARE LOWER THAN THE COUNTY, THE 
20:37:22 SUICIDE RATE IN FREMONT WAS THE HIGHEST SINCE 2012.
AND THE SELF-INFLICTED INJURY RATE, 
20:37:38 E.D. VISIT RATE FOR THOSE UNDER THE AGE OF 18 WAS ALSO HIGHEST IN FREMONT.
PARENTS SHARED -- ENCOURAGING THEIR 
20:37:46 CHILDREN TO LEARN HEALTHY HABITS.
AEROBIC CAPACITY AND BODY COMPOSITION HAVE BEEN GETTING WORSE WITH OUR YOUTH 
20:37:53 IN OUR DISTRICT.
IN FREMONT THERE'S AN UPWARD TREND FOR NEEDED -- IN THE 5TH AND 7TH GRADE IN 
20:38:05 MEETING THEIR STANDARDS.
WASHINGTON HOSPITAL HAS MANY CLINICAL OFFERINGS AND THIS IS A SHORTLIST OF 
20:38:12 THE SERVICES WE PROVIDE.
OUR PROGRAMS UNDER GS RIGOROUS REQUIREMENTS TO ENSURE THE PROVISION 
20:38:19 OF HIGH QUALITY OF CARE.
WE WILL ADD MORE FOCUS IN THIS REPORT GIVEN ITS HIGH  PREVALENCE.

20:38:29 THE NEXT TWO SLIDES ARE RELATED TO HEALTH IMPACT OF ECONOMIC INSECURITY.
SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH WAS 
20:38:33 RANKED AS A HIGH PRIORITY IN THE COMMUNITY.
THE WIDE VARIETY OF EXPERTS AND 
20:38:39 COMMUNITY MEMBERS DISCUSSED THEIR CONCERNS REGARDING EDUCATION AND ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT.

20:38:46 ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT CAME UP OFTEN AS A DRIVER OF ECONOMIC SECURITY, HOWEVER, ACCORDING TO A PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERT 
20:38:53  INTERVIEWED, RESIDENTS WITH COLLEGE DEGREES MAY STILL BE VULNERABLE TO POVERTY AND WE LEARNED LOCAL JOBS DO 
20:39:08 NOT PAY WORKERS ENOUGH TO AFFORD THE HIGH COST OF LIVING.
HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS RANKED AS A 
20:39:14 HIGH NEED IN OUR COMMUNITY.
KEEPING A ROOF OVER THEIR HEADS HAS A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON  FAMILIES.

20:39:18 THE NUMBER OF RESIDENTS LIVING IN OVERCROWDED HOMES HAS INCREASED SINCE 2011.

20:39:27 WITH CLOSE TO 40% OF THE RESIDENTS IN FREMONT SPEND 30% OR MORE OF THEIR INCOME ON RENT.

20:39:33 FOLLOWING THE COUNTYWIDE TREND, THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS NEARLY DOUBLED IN 2019 
20:39:39 FROM 2017.
AND SAME WITH THE NUMBER OF UNSHELTERED INDIVIDUALS.

20:39:47 IT SHOULD BE NOTED PEOPLE WHO ARE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS ARE AT A GREATER RISK OF PREVENTABLE ILLNESS 
20:39:53 REQUIRING LONGER HOSPITAL STAYS AND FACE A GREATER RISK OF PREMATURE DEATH.

20:40:04 IN RESPONSE, WASHINGTON HOSPITAL IS COMMITTED TO STRENGTHENING OUR PARTNERSHIPS -- TO SUPPORT HOUSING AND 
20:40:09 HOMELESSNESS.
WE WILL CONTINUE PARTNERING WITH LOCAL CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND OTHER BUSINESS 
20:40:12 ORGANIZATIONS TO PROMOTE AND FOSTER BUSINESS GROWTH FOR POTENTIAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES.

20:40:22 I WOULD BE REMISS IF I DID NOT DISCUSS THE CURRENT HEALTH CRISIS AND THAT IS COVID-19.

20:40:32 THIS GLOBAL PANDEMIC -- WASHINGTON HOSPITAL INITIATED AND INCREASED SEVERAL INFECTION PREVENTION MEASURES 
20:40:41 TO PROTECT OUR PATIENTS AND STAFF.
WE HOSTED COPING PRESENTATIONS RELATED TO THE PANDEMIC ON FACEBOOK LIVE AND 
20:40:46 YOUTUBE.
WE ALSO OPENED OUR COMMUNITY VACCINATION CLINIC ON MONDAY, FEBRUARY 
20:40:50 1ST.
AS A COMMUNITY HOSPITAL, WE EXTENDED THIS OPPORTUNITY TO ALL RESIDENTS OF 
20:40:56 OUR HEALTHCARE DISTRICT WHO ARE AT LEAST 50 YEARS OF AGE REGARDLESS OF THEIR INSURANCE.

20:41:08 WE ARE ALSO VACCINATING THOSE WHO FALL UNDER THE TIER 1 SCENE AND THEY ARE THE ESSENTIAL WORKERS -- A FULL LIST 
20:41:13 OF THOSE ELIGIBLE IN OUR COUNTY CAN BE FOUND ON THE ALAMEDA COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT'S WEBSITE.

20:41:25 ELIGIBLE COMMUNITY MEMBERS CAN SCHEDULE THEIR VACCINES.
AS OF MONDAY, APRIL 5TH, WE HAVE 
20:41:31 VACCINATED OVER 19,000 COMMUNITY MEMBERS.
AND FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE 
20:41:37 STATE ROLLOUT SCHEDULE, WE RECOMMEND COMMUNITY MEMBERS TO VISIT MYTURN.CA.GOV.

20:41:47 OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS PASSED THE COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PLAN AND IT INCLUDES VARIOUS COLLABORATIONS IN 
20:41:52 CIVIC AND COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATIONS, AND WE'RE ALSO EXPLORING  EXISTING PROGRAMS TO 
20:41:59 IMPROVE HEALTH AND WELLNESS.
AND MOREOVER, WE ARE CREATING MORE PARTNERSHIPS TO ENHANCE THE SUPPORT OF 
20:42:07 OUR COMMUNITY.
AT WASHINGTON HOSPITAL, WE'RE COMMITTED TO ENSURING THAT YOU AND OUR 
20:42:11 COMMUNITY MEMBERS HAVE ACCESS TO THE LATEST HEALTH INFORMATION.
THE FULL REPORT AND OUR COMMUNITY 
20:42:16 HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PLAN IS AVAILABLE ON OUR  WEBSITE.
AND I HOPE THAT YOU HAVE FOUND THIS 
20:42:21 INFORMATION -- THIS PRESENTATION INFORMATIVE.
ON BEHALF OF WASHINGTON  HOSPITAL, I'D 
20:42:28 LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME, AND I'D LIKE TO TAKE SOME QUESTIONS.
>> Mayor Mei: GREAT.

20:42:31 THANK YOU.
AT THIS TIME, I'M GOING TO TURN IT BACK TO OUR COUNCIL FOR QUESTIONS AT 
20:42:42 THIS TIME.
SEEING NO QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME FROM OUR COUNCIL, I WILL TURN IT OVER TO -- 
20:42:47 THERE'S ONE PUBLIC SPEAKER FOR QUESTION -- OR COMMENT, EITHER WAY, FOR 3 MINUTES.

20:42:53 AND THEN WE'LL TURN IT BACK TO DISCUSSION FOR THE COUNCIL.
BLAIR BEEKMAN?

20:42:57 >> THANK YOU.
BLAIR BEEKMAN.
THANK YOU FOR THIS ITEM.

20:43:06 I THINK IT'S MORE PUBLIC  COMMENT.
FIRST OF ALL, I WISH THERE  WAS -- IT WAS A NICE REPORT.

20:43:13 I HOPE IT CAN SOMEHOW MAKE THE COUNCIL AGENDA FOR THE FINAL AGENDA AND THERE CAN BE SOME SORT OF INFORMATION THAT I 
20:43:21 CAN READ ABOUT THIS IN THE AGENDA ITSELF.
IT WAS INTERESTING LEARNING ABOUT.

20:43:32 JUST TODAY I HEARD ON THE RADIO THAT THERE'S A CHANCE THAT  FOR-PROFIT HOSPITALS, THERE'S MEDICAL FORGIVENESS 
20:43:41 IDEAS THAT ARE STARTING UP FOR FOR-PROFIT HOSPITALS, FULL MEDICAL FORGIVENESS IN THIS TIME OF COVID-19.

20:43:55 I WONDER LEARNING THAT WASHINGTON HOSPITAL IS A  NON-PROFIT, NOT FOR PROFIT HOSPITAL WITH NON-PROFIT 
20:44:00 STATUS.
IT SEEMS TO ME THERE WOULD BE EASIER WAYS TO WORK ON FULL MEDICAL 
20:44:07 FORGIVENESS IDEAS.
AND IT BRINGS UP THE CONCEPT I WAS TRYING MY BEST TO TALK ABOUT EARLIER 
20:44:12 THAT I WAS A LITTLE CONVOLUTED ABOUT, I'M SORRY.
THINGS ARE A LITTLE TOUGH FOR  ME.

20:44:24 THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE AS I AM TRYING TO WORK OUT HOPING TO MAKE SOMETHING EASIER FOR -- IN PUBLIC 
20:44:32 COMMENT THAT CAN BE EASIER TO TALK ABOUT OVERALL, THAT IS MY GOAL, IS THAT HOW  CAN -- HOW CAN WE ADDRESS 
20:44:38 OUR FUTURE COVID, HOW CAN PEOPLE BE TAKEN CARE OF, WHAT ARE OUR CHOICES TO DO THAT?

20:44:48 DO WE LEAVE PEOPLE HAVING TO PAY ITS DEBT BURDEN BASICALLY, OR DO WE LEARN HOW TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY TO FULLY 
20:44:58 PAY FOR, YOU KNOW, A PANDEMIC THAT IS NOT THE FAULT OF EVERYDAY PEOPLE AT ALL, AND TO HOLD THEM TO THAT -- TO 
20:45:06 OUR CURRENT SYSTEM OF -- CAPITALIST SYSTEM IS REALLY  HURTFUL, IT'S NOT VERY GOOD.

20:45:13 AND YOU KNOW, IT'S FROM LEARNING THESE NEW PATTERNS OF JUST  OFFERING RELIEF TO EACH OTHER AND THAT PEOPLE DON'T 
20:45:21 GET HURT, THAT'S MY GOAL, IS TO WORK ON, AND THOSE ARE THE GOALS THAT WE ADDRESS THE FUTURE PANDEMICS AND 
20:45:27 SOCIAL PLANNING, LARGE SCALE SOCIAL PLANNING WHERE WE DON'T SIMPLY HURT EACH OTHER IN THE FUTURE, WHERE WE 
20:45:34 PLAN WELL AND WISELY.
AND NOT TO HURT EACH OTHER.
THESE ARE THE ISSUES TO ADDRESS YOUR 
20:45:40  DOWNTOWN ISSUES, HOW YOU'RE GOING TO BE UPCOMING PLANNING FOR THOSE ISSUES, BECAUSE YOU NEED HEALTHY PEOPLE.

20:45:48 WE NEED PEOPLE WITH INCOME.
WE NEED PEOPLE WITH MONEY TO HAVE YOUR DOWNTOWN AREAS.

20:45:54 SO I'M HOPING -- TAKING CARE OF EACH OTHER, THEN WE ADDRESS ISSUES FROM THERE.

20:46:01 THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: WELCOME, NEXT SPEAKER IS LISA DANZ.

20:46:04 >> HI.
THANK YOU.
THIS IS LISA DANZ FROM  DISTRICT 3.

20:46:11 FIRST OFF I DO AGREE WITH  MR. BEEKMAN THAT THE ITEM ON THE A AGENDA DIDN'T HAVE A LINK THIS TIME, SO IT WAS 
20:46:15 TRICKY TO DO OUR STUDYING AHEAD OF TIME.
I WAS CURIOUS SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THE 
20:46:20 RATES OF ASTHMA AND COPD.
I THOUGHT IT WAS INTERESTING IF I UNDERSTOOD THE GRAPH CORRECTLY THAT IT 
20:46:26 LOOKS LIKE WE'RE DOING WORSE THAN NEIGHBORING CITIES ON ASTHMA BUT BETTER ON COPT, WHICH I'VE ALWAYS 
20:46:35 ASSOCIATED THOSE AS BOTH DISEASES THAT ARE CAUSED BY AIR QUALITY ISSUES.
SO I'M CURIOUS IF THERE'S MUCH IN 
20:46:41 THERE ABOUT WHAT'S CAUSING THOSE AND IF THERE ARE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPROVEMENTS WE NEED TO BE DOING TO DECREASE OUR 
20:46:45 COMMUNITY RATES OF POLLUTION AND THESE DISEASES.
THANK YOU.

20:46:53 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
AT THIS TIME, I'LL TURN IT BACK TO OUR COUNCIL FOR DISCUSSION.

20:47:03 COUNCILMEMBER JONES.
DID YOU JUST --
>> Councilmember Jones: IT WAS 
20:47:10 ACTUALLY JUST -- I WAS CHANGING THE SCREEN VIEW, BUT I JUST  WANTED TO MAKE A COMMENT TO  MS. HERNANDEZ ABOUT 
20:47:17 THE NUMBER OF WELLNESS PROGRAMS THAT WASHINGTON HOSPITAL HAS IS MUCH APPRECIATED BY THE COMMUNITY AND ALL I 
20:47:21 CAN SAY IS KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK.
YOU'RE DOING A LOT OF OUTREACH AND IT REALLY SHOWS.

20:47:29 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
COUNCILMEMBER COX.
>> Councilmember Cox: THANK YOU.

20:47:39 THANK YOU SO MUCH, LUCY HERNANDEZ.
I REALLY APPRECIATE THE PARTNERSHIP WITH WASHINGTON HOSPITAL, AND YOU 
20:47:49 PROBABLY KNOW LAST WEEK THERE WAS A COVID-19 TOWN HALL THAT WORKING WITH THE CEO KIMBERLY HARTZ AND  DR. 
20:47:54 JEFFREY STEWART, CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER.
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I WAS CURIOUS 
20:48:03 IN TERMS OF -- TWO THINGS.
ONE IS YOU MENTION ABOUT THE YOUTH, 5TH AND 7TH GRADERS.

20:48:09 COULD YOU EXPAND ON WHERE WE NEED SOME AREAS OF IMPROVEMENT?
I WANTED TO JUST MAKE SURE I HEARD IT 
20:48:17 CORRECTLY.
AND YOU REFERRED TO ONE OF THE CHARTS THERE AND WHAT'S  HAPPENING OR WHAT 
20:48:37 YOU THINK IS BEING THE ROOT CAUSE OF THAT AREA THAT NEEDS IMPROVEMENT.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU,  MS. 
20:48:40 HERNANDEZ.
I THINK YOU'RE ON MUTE STILL.
>> SORRY ABOUT THAT.

20:48:49 I DIDN'T REALIZE I WAS STILL ON MUTE.
SO HERE IS THE GRAPH FOR THE YOUTH IN OUR DISTRICT.

20:48:56 SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE LEARNED FROM THE PARENTS THAT THEY'RE HAVING TROUBLE ENCOURAGING THEIR CHILDREN TO 
20:49:03 ADOPT HEALTHY HABITS, AND WE COULD ONLY IMAGINE IT GETTING WORSE DUE TO THE PANDEMIC.

20:49:14 WHEN THE REPORT WAS ACCOMPLISHED OR WHILE WE WERE PULLING DATA, IT WAS PRE-PANDEMIC.

20:49:25 SO THERE WAS A LOT OF SCREEN TIME THAT CONTRIBUTED TOWARDS UNHEALTHY HABITS.
SO NOW VIRTUAL LEARNING, WE COULD ONLY 
20:49:36 IMAGINE IT GETTING WORSE WHERE THERE'S AN INCREASE OF SCREEN TIME, AND SO ONE OF THE THINGS WE CAN DO IS LOOKING AT 
20:49:42 -- WHAT WE'RE DOING AT THE HOSPITAL, WE'RE EXPLORING ON PARTNERING WITH EAST BAY REGIONAL PARKS AND PERHAPS 
20:49:49 LOOKING AT HOW WE CAN CREATE SOME OUTDOOR ACTIVITIES AND ENCOURAGING PHYSICAL FITNESS THROUGH THAT.

20:50:00 >> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.
AND THAT'S ALSO WITH THE STUDENTS BEING MORE CONFINED, IS THAT WE'RE 
20:50:10 TRYING TO FIND  OUTLETS BASED ON THAT WITH YOUR PARTNERSHIP WITH THE PARKS.
ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS I WANTED TO 
20:50:18 SEE IS I DIDN'T KNOW IF THERE WAS ANY OTHER BREAKDOWN BUT THIS IS JUST THE OVERALL POPULATION OF A SURVEY THAT 
20:50:24 WAS TAKEN?
IS THAT HOW THAT DATA WAS ATTRIBUTED FROM BASED ON A SURVEY OR BASED ON 
20:50:34 YOUR DATA FROM THE HOSPITAL RECORDS?
>> SO THE REPORT IS ACTUALLY THROUGH -- WE GET DATA FROM ALAMEDA PUBLIC 
20:50:40 HEALTH DEPARTMENT AND ALSO THE CALIFORNIA EDUCATION, AND I DON'T HAVE -- I APOLOGIZE, I DON'T HAVE THE NOTES 
20:50:49 IN FRONT OF ME.
IT IS IN A REPORT, I CAN SEND YOU THE -- WHERE THE DATA WAS PULLED FROM.

20:50:58 SO THIS WAS FROM THE CALIFORNIA EDUCATION -- DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION, SO THEY DO IN THE  5TH, 7TH AND 9TH 
20:51:07 GRADE, THERE IS A PHYSICAL -- IT'S ALMOST A PHYSICAL WELLNESS CHECK AND TO SEE IF THEY NEED IMPROVEMENT IN 
20:51:16 THEIR BODY COMPOSITION AND ALSO AEROBIC CAPACITY.
SO THAT DATA WAS PULLED FROM THAT 
20:51:23 REPORT SO WE COULD ONLY LOOK AT -- FROM OUR OWN TOWNSHIP DISTRICT, SO THAT'S FREMONT UNIFIED, NEWARK, NEW HAVEN AND 
20:51:31 SUNOL.
SO THAT DATA WAS PULLED FROM -- SO IT'S A QUANTITATIVE DATA.

20:51:36 >> Councilmember Cox: OKAY, GOTCHA.
THAT EXPLAINS THAT.
MY SECOND QUESTION IS REGARDING 
20:51:44 COVID-19.
TWO THINGS.
ONE IS, ARE THERE PLANS WITH 
20:51:58 WASHINGTON HOSPITAL IN TERMS OF HAVING SOME SORT OF MOBILE VACCINATION OR MOBILE TESTING, LIKE VANS, THAT CAN 
20:52:08 PROVIDE TIMELY TESTING RESULTS THAT ARE SPEED, ACCURACY, AND THEN ALSO FOR THOSE THAT ARE NOT ABLE TO DRIVE OR 
20:52:17 GET THERE, TO GET THEIR VACCINATIONS FOR WHATEVER  REASON, IS THERE OTHER OUTREACH TO GO MOBILE AND GO TO THE 
20:52:23  DWELLINGS WHERE PEOPLE ARE LOCATED?
>> WE ARE EXPLORING HOW TO REACH OUT TO OUR VULNERABLE  POPULATIONS, 
20:52:31 INCLUDING THOSE THAT WOULD HAVE TRANSPORTATION ISSUES, SO WE ARE EXPLORING WAYS TO VACCINATE OUR 
20:52:37 VULNERABLE POPULATION.
SO AT THIS TIME, I DO NOT HAVE THE INFORMATION TO PRESENT BUT WE ARE 
20:52:45 EXPLORING THOSE MEANS TO GET TO THE VULNERABLE  POPULATIONS.
>> Councilmember Cox: WHAT ABOUT 
20:52:54 TESTING, TAKING THAT ALSO OUT TO THE MOBILE -- BEING MOBILE ABOUT THAT AS WELL IN CASE SOME MAY MAKE OTHER 
20:53:03 DECISIONS NOT TO BE VACCINATED, BUT IN TERMS OF  JUST -- IF THERE'S SOME  ACCESSIBILITY OR SOMETHING BEING 
20:53:10 LOOKED AT RIGHT NOW?
>> WE DID PARTNER WITH ALAMEDA COUNTY, THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT, TO DO MOBILE 
20:53:16 TESTING.
SO AT THIS TIME, I BELIEVE THE FOCUS WAS ON THE VACCINATION.

20:53:23 WE CAN'T CONTINUE LOOKING INTO THE MOBILE TESTING PIECE.
I WILL FOLLOW UP AND I CAN GET YOU 
20:53:28 THAT INFORMATION.
>> Councilmember Cox: THANK YOU SO MUCH.

20:53:35 >> Mayor Mei: COUNCILMEMBER  KENG.
>> Councilmember Keng: THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR.

20:53:40 THANK YOU, LUCY, VERY MUCH FON YOUR PRESENTATION AND FOR ALL OF YOUR WORK AT WASHINGTON  HOSPITAL.

20:53:50 I JUST HAVE A QUICK QUESTION ABOUT THE STATISTICS ON THE HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS.

20:53:58 SO YOU MENTIONED THAT BECAUSE OF THEIR CONDITION ON THE STREET, IT CAUSES THEM TO HAVE LONGER HOSPITAL STAYS 
20:54:08 ONCE THEY, YOU KNOW, EVENTUALLY COME IN, SO I'M WONDERING WHAT KIND OF LIKE CURRENT AND FUTURE PROGRAMS THAT WE 
20:54:13 HAVE WITH HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS TO PERHAPS HELP THEM WITH EARLY TREATMENT?

20:54:20 THANK YOU.
>> FOR HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS, WE ARE WORKING WITH -- WE'RE CURRENTLY 
20:54:30 WORKING WITH THE CITY OF FREMONT HUMAN SERVICES DIVISION AND WE'RE LOOKING AT HOW TO PARTNER OUR -- HOWL TO CONTINUE 
20:54:38 OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH THE CITY OF FREMONT'S HUMAN SERVICES DIVISION.
IN TERMS OF PREVENTION OR PREVENTIVE 
20:54:45 CARE, AT ONE POINT WE HAD OUR MOBILE HEALTH UNIT THAT WOULD GO OUT INTO THE COMMUNITY AND PROVIDE THAT -- PROVIDE 
20:54:55 SUPPORT, HOWEVER, THERE IS ANOTHER -- THERE'S BAY AREA COMMUNITY CENTER OR -- IS IT HEALTH CENTER OR -- ANYHOW -- 
20:54:58 I KNOW THEY JUST CHANGED IT, IT USED TO BE TRI-CITY HEALTH CENTER.
>> Councilmember Cox: EXACTLY.

20:55:07 >> THEY CURRENTLY HAVE SOME MOBILE UNITS THAT GO OUT SO THAT WOULD BE A POTENTIAL PARTNERSHIP IN WORKING WITH 
20:55:13 THEM OR COLLABORATION WORKING WITH OUR COMMUNITY CLINICS.
>> Councilmember Keng: GOT IT.

20:55:20 THANK YOU SO MUCH.
BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND THAT IF THEY GET TO BE REALLY SICK, THEN THEY WALK INTO 
20:55:28 E.R., THEN THE COSTS WILL BE A LOT HIGHER AND NOT AS SUCCESSFUL.
>> YES, WE REALLY WANT TO MAKE SURE 
20:55:36 THAT THE E.R. IS NOT USED AS A PRIMARY CARE, SO WE REALLY WANT TO STRENGTHEN THE PARTNERSHIPS THAT WE HAVE WITH OUR 
20:55:44 COMMUNITY CLINICS.
>> Councilmember Keng: SOUNDS GREAT.
THANK YOU.

20:55:47 >> Mayor Mei: JUST MAKING SURE NO OTHER COUNCILMEMBERS HAVE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS.

20:55:53 I JUST WANTED TO SAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO WASHINGTON HOSPITAL AND LUCY FOR YOUR PRESENTATION.

20:55:58 IT'S BEEN A CONTINUED RESOURCE FOR OUR COMMUNITY THROUGH THESE VERY CHALLENGING TIMES, AND I WANTED TO 
20:56:06 THANK ALL OF OUR FRONT LINE WORKERS, AND I KNOW LAST WEEK YOU CELEBRATED DOCTORS -- WORLD DOCTORS DAY AS WELL 
20:56:12 AS I KNOW WE HAD OPPORTUNITY TO RECOGNIZE YOUR NURSES.
I REALLY WANT TO THANK SO MANY MEMBERS 
20:56:18 OF THE COMMUNITY WHO STEPPED FORWARD TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE FRONT LINE WORKERS AND PROVIDING CARE FOR US.

20:56:27 I RECOGNIZE AS A -- WELL, ONE AS A PATIENT OR I GUESS -- MY CHILDREN ARE PRODUCTS OF WASHINGTON HOSPITAL, SO I 
20:56:33 HAVE TO THANK YOU FOR THAT.
BUT CERTAINLY I KNOW WHEN YOUR STUDIES ARE CONDUCTED WITH THE WELLNESS, THOSE 
20:56:37 ARE THINGS THAT CERTAINLY ARE CONCERNS, AND I REMEMBER HAVING BEEN ON THE SCHOOL BOARD, THOSE ARE REGULAR 
20:56:43 PHYSICAL FITNESS TESTS THAT ARE CONDUCTED AT THOSE GRADE LEVEL, SO I AM CONCERNED THAT DURING THIS PERIOD 
20:56:49 OF COVID, IF THE STUDENTS ARE NOT IN SCHOOL, WE'RE NOT ABLE TO CATCH SOME OF THESE OTHER HEALTH RISKS AND HEALTH 
20:56:53 CONCERNS, SO THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS OF CONCERN.
ARE THERE OTHER OPTIONS THAT YOU'RE 
20:56:57 TRYING TO PROVIDE?
I KNOW THAT YOU'RE PARTNERING WITH EAST BAY REGIONAL PARKS AND PERHAPS 
20:57:02 YOU'RE ALSO PARTNERING WITH OUR FREMONT FAMILY RESOURCE CENTER AND OTHERS TO PROVIDE SOME OF THOSE OPPORTUNITIES 
20:57:10 FOR WELLNESS AND HEALTH.
I KNOW YOU'VE DONE A VIDEO AND ONLINE BUT IS THERE SOMETHING YOU'RE DOING 
20:57:15 THE IN THE INTERIM TO BE ABLE TO EVALUATE THE STUDENTS?
>> I'M ACTUALLY -- I'M PROPOSING TO 
20:57:21 PRESENT TO THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND TO SEE HOW WE CAN STRENGTHEN THAT RELATIONSHIP  TOO.

20:57:27 SO IT WOULD NOT NECESSARILY JUST BE WITHIN WASHINGTON HOSPITAL.
WE CAN ALSO WORK WITH OUR SCHOOL 
20:57:36 DISTRICTS IN REGARDS TO HOW TO IMPROVE THE HEALTH OF OUR YOUTH.
>> Mayor Mei: I KNOW THIS MONTH IS 
20:57:42 ALSO EARTH DAY AND EARTH MONTH AND IN THE PAST  NON-PANDEMIC, WE USUALLY HAVE A CELEBRATION WITH THE HEALTH 
20:57:47 FAIR THERE.
AND PART OF THAT HAS BEEN ABOUT -- WE TALKED ABOUT SOME OF OUR GUIDELINES 
20:57:51 AND FARMING AS WELL AS HEALTHY EATING, SO I WOULD ENCOURAGE THAT.
I KNOW WE'VE HAD SOME EFFORTS WITH 
20:57:58 STOPWASTE ALSO WITH PARTNERSHIP WITH US IN TERMS OF HEALTHY WAYS TO COOK AND ALSO SOME OF THE RECYCLING AND 
20:58:04 OPPORTUNITIES FOR THOSE, SO I WOULD HOPE THAT YOU PARTNER WITH THAT.
AND THEN FINALLY, I WANTED TO THANK 
20:58:08 WASHINGTON HOSPITAL FOR THEIR PARTNERSHIP.
RIGHT NOW AS WE'RE WORKING THROUGH 
20:58:16 NATIONAL LEAGUE OF CITIES, WE ARE A CITY OF OPPORTUNITY THIS YEAR SO I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THE RESULTS OF 
20:58:24 THIS.
IN PARTICULAR, WE ARE FOCUSING ON THE ISSUES OF HEALTH EQUITY AND SOME OF 
20:58:29 THE OPPORTUNITIES IN THAT AREA, SO I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THE EFFORTS THAT WE CAN BRING TOGETHER, WHETHER IT'S CITY 
20:58:33 STAFF AND ALSO WASHINGTON HOSPITAL AND CERTAINLY THE NATIONAL LEAGUE OF CITIES.

20:58:39 SO I'M VERY EXCITED ABOUT THAT, AND I LOOK FORWARD TO PARTICIPATING IN THAT PROCESS, SO THANK YOU FOR THAT 
20:58:44 PARTNERSHIP AND CONTINUED EFFORTS.
OTHER THINGS THAT YOU'VE WORKED ON, I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S SOMETHING YOU WOULD 
20:58:48 CALL AS AN ISSUE AND I DIDN'T NOTICE IT IN YOUR SLIDES BUT THERE'S ALSO OPIOIDS.

20:58:53 IN THE PAST, I'VE BEEN TO YOUR CLASSES THERE AND YOU'VE WORKED PARTICULARLY WITH YOUR STAFF BUT ALSO IN THE 
20:59:00 COMMUNITY, AND WE HAVE NOT HAD THAT AS MUCH OF A FOCUS BUT I THINK THESE TYPES OF THINGS, ONE THAT CONCERNS ME 
20:59:04 THE MOST LOOKING AT YOUR SLIDES PERTAINS TO MENTAL HEALTH.
SO I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY THE ONE 
20:59:09 AREA I'M HOPING WE CAN PARTNER ON AND LOOK FORWARD TO THE ADDITIONAL COLLABORATION, WHETHER IT'S THROUGH 
20:59:15 OUR POLICE AND THROUGH OUR COMMUNITY  OUTREACH, AND PARTICULAR AS YOU MENTIONED AND NOTED THROUGH OUR 
20:59:21 HOMELESSNESS, SO WE'RE HOPING TO BE ABLE TO DELIVER THOSE.
AND I THANK YOU FOR THAT PARTNERSHIP.

20:59:26 SEEING NO OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME, I JUST WANTED TO THANK EVERYONE FOR THEIR PRESENTATION AND SO 
20:59:32 SPEAKING OF BEING HEALTHY, I KNOW MANY OF YOU HAD THE CHANCE HOPEFULLY TO TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF A BREAK AND AS WE 
20:59:38 ARE NOW MOVING INTO THE ORANGE TIER, I ASK THAT YOU CONTINUE TO WORK WITH US TO KEEP EVERYONE  HEALTHY, AND SO THAT 
20:59:45 MEANS STILL FOLLOWING WITH THE GUIDELINES AS POSSIBLE, IN TERMS OF SOCIAL DISTANCING AND ALSO WITH THE 
20:59:49 WEARING OF THE FACE COVERINGS OR MASKS.
I KNOW THAT WE ARE TRYING TO DELIVER 
20:59:58 THOSE SERVICES AND SO I APPRECIATE THOSE RESOURCES AND TOLLS BEING MADE AS WELL AS YOU ALLOWING US TO KNOW 
21:00:04 WHAT THE STATISTICS ARE, ESPECIALLY AS WE ENTER INTO GREATER TIERS AND MORE EXPANSION OF THOSE ACCESSIBILITY.

21:00:09 SO I LOOK FORWARD TO THAT CONVERSATION, AND HOPEFULLY CONTINUING THIS PARTNERSHIP, AND ON BEHALF OF 
21:00:16 EVERYONE, I JUST WANTED TO WISH EVERYONE TO BE WELL, STAY HEALTHY, AND TO BE HOPEFULLY KIND AND PEACEFUL TO 
21:00:21 ONE ANOTHER.
AND SO I THINK WITH THAT, I'M GOING TO CALL THE MEETING TO CLOSE AT 9:00 
21:00:23 P.M.
SO THANK YOU SO MUCH AND HOPE YOU HAVE A WONDERFUL DAY.
