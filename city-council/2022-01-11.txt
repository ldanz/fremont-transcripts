IF THEY COULD TURN ON THEIR CAMERAS, 
19:08:56 IT'S FOR LILY ZHANG.
I THINK HER COACH IS ALSO JOINING HER ON THAT.

19:09:04 SO WELCOME.
WHEREAS, 50 YEARS AFTER THE UNITED STATES AND CHINA TEAM ENGAGED IN WHAT 
19:09:11 BECAME KNOWN AS PING-PONG DIPLOMACY, TABLE TENNIS PLAYERS FROM BOTH  COUNTRIES CAME TOGETHER TO FORM A PAIR 
19:09:20 OF MIXED DOUBLES TEAMS TO COMPETE AT THE 2021 WORLD TABLE TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS FINALS IN HOUSTON, AND 
19:09:33 WHEREAS, ONE OF THOSE TEAMS WAS AMERICAN LILY  ZHANG AND CHINA'S LIN GAOYUAN, REACHING THE SEMIFINAL ROUND 
19:09:45 TO ACHIEVE THE BRONZE MEDAL, AND WHERE THE CITY OF FREMONT PROUDLY RECOGNIZES LILY FOR ACHIEVING A BRONZE MEDAL, AND 
19:09:51 WHEREAS THIS IS NOTEWORTHY AS THIS MAKES HISTORY WITH FREMONT RESIDENT LILY ZHANG BEING THE FIRST AMERICAN 
19:10:01 SINCE 1959, 62 YEAR, TO EARN A MEDAL IN TABLE TENNIS WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS.
AND WHEREAS, LILY ZHANG IS A PROUD 
19:10:05 FREMONT RESIDENT WHOSE HOME CLUB IS TABLE TENNIS AMERICA, TTA, OF FREMONT.

19:10:14 NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF FREMONT HEREBY INVITES THE CITY OF FREMONT 
19:10:23 COMMUNITY TO SHARE OUR WARM CONGRATULATIONS ON THIS HISTORIC ACCOMPLISHMENT FOR LILY ZHANG'S 
19:10:26 EXCELLENCE IN SPORTS IS AN INSPIRATION TO OUR COMMUNITY, OUR COUNTRY AND INTERNATIONALLY.

19:10:34 SO I JUST WANTED TO CONGRATULATE YOU ON THIS ACCOMPLISHMENT, IN 62 YEARS, AND WE'RE CERTAINLY PROUD THAT YOU'RE FROM 
19:10:39 -- AND SO IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO SHARE SOME COMMENTS BRIEFLY FOR LIKE TWO TO THREE MINUTES?

19:10:49 >> OH, SURE.
FIRST OF ALL, I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE CONGRATULATIONS 
19:10:54 AND YOUR REALLY KIND WORDS.
IT'S STILL A DREAM TO ME.
I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE THAT HAPPENED.

19:11:05 AND IT WAS TRULY SUCH AN HONOR TO HAVE EVEN HAD THAT OPPORTUNITY.
AND I JUST THINK IT WAS EVEN MORE 
19:11:14 SPECIAL BECAUSE IT WAS THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF PING-PONG DIPLOMACY WHEN THE U.S. AND CHINA CAME TOGETHER 
19:11:23 AND UNITED OVER A SPORT, SO I JUST FEEL LIKE IT TRANSCENDS A LOT OF BOUNDARIES, AND I JUST LOVE BEING PART 
19:11:32 OF, YOU KNOW, A MOMENT THAT IS REALLY SPECIAL.
SO THANK YOU AGAIN, AND I HOPE THAT I 
19:11:42 CAN DO MORE IN THE FUTURE FOR FREMONT, FOR THE U.S., AND JUST REALLY GRATEFUL.

19:11:47 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU FOR REPRESENTING US AND CONGRATULATIONS ALSO TO YOUR COACH AND FOR THE 
19:11:51 OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO WORK TOGETHER.
WE WANT TO SHOW PEOPLE THAT GOOD 
19:11:56 SPORTSMANSHIP AND TOGETHER  EVERYONE CAN ACHIEVE MORE.
I JUST WANTED TO THANK YOU FOR THAT, 
19:12:02 AND IT'S BEEN GREAT SEEING YOU OVER THE YEARS, AND I'VE HAD THE CHANCE TO WATCH YOU FROM THE BEGINNING, SO IT'S 
19:12:08 BEEN A GREAT JOURNEY TO WITNESS.
AND I HOPE THAT, YOU KNOW, FREMONT IS HOME TO MANY ATHLETES AND WE WOULD 
19:12:14 LOVE TO SEE MORE, ALWAYS BRING BACK THE GOLD FOR US, BRING BACK MEDALS, AND WE'RE DELIGHTED.

19:12:17 SO BEST OF LUCK AS YOU CONTINUE THIS.
>> OF COURSE.

>> Mayor Mei: SO NEXT, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE RAISING YOUR HAND FOR THE NEXT 
19:12:32 ITEM, MS. COX?
>> Councilmember Cox: ACTUALLY I WANTED TO PERSONALLY CONGRATULATE LILY 
19:12:40 ZHANG.
I KNOW THAT IN 2018 AND 2020, WE DID HAVE OHLONE COLLEGE STUDENT BY THE 
19:12:50 NAME OF KOJU WAS ALSO A WORLD CHAMPION FOR TABLE TENNIS AT OHLONE COLLEGE, AND I BELIEVE SHE KNOWS YOU AS WELL, 
19:12:58 BECAUSE THE LEAGUE IS VERY SMALL, BUT I ALSO WANTED TO MENTION THAT WE ALSO HAD A PREVIOUS CHAMPION, BUT 
19:13:06  CONGRATULATIONS TO LILY AS THE CURRENT REIGNING CHAMPION AND WISHING YOU ALL THE BEST, BUT I JUST WANTED TO ADD 
19:13:10 THAT OHLONE HAS BEEN HOME TO SOME OF THE WORLD CHAMPIONS IN TABLE TENNIS AS WELL.

19:13:39 >> THANK YOU SO MUCH AGAIN.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
NEXT, I'D LIKE TO SHARE A PROCLAMATION 
19:13:55 THAT WILL BE PRESENTED, AND I BELIEVE THAT IT'S GOING TO BE ACCEPTED BY MS. JOHNSON.

19:14:04 THIS IS A PROCLAMATION ON  DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. DAY AND BEYOND.
WHEREAS, DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. 
19:14:12 DEVOTED HIS LIFE ON ADVANCING EQUALITY, SOCIAL JUSTICE FOR ALL AND CHALLENGED AMERICANS TO PARTICIPATE IN THE NEVER 
19:14:17 ENDING WORK OF BUILDING A MORE PERFECT UNION, AND WHEREAS DR. KING'S TEACHINGS CONTINUE TO GUIDE AND 
19:14:25 INSPIRE US TO ADDRESS CHALLENGES IN OUR COMMUNITIES, AND WHEREAS THE KING HOLIDAY AND SERVICE ACT, ENACTED IN 
19:14:33 1994 BY THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS AND INITIATED BY HIS DEVOTED WIFE CORETTA SCOTT KING TO BE DESIGNATED THE KING 
19:14:39 HOLIDAY AS A NATIONAL DAY OF VOLUNTEER SERVICE, AND WHEREAS SINCE 1994, MILLIONS OF AMERICANS HAVE BEEN 
19:14:45 INSPIRED BY THE LIFE AND WORK OF DR. KING TO SERVE THEIR  NEIGHBORS AND COMMUNITIES ON THE KING HOLIDAY, AND 
19:14:52 WHEREAS, SERVING ON THE KING HOLIDAY IS AN APPROPRIATE WAY TO HONOR  DR. KING, MEET LOCAL, STATE AND NATIONAL NEEDS, 
19:15:01 AND BRINGS OUR CITIZENS TOGETHER TO STRENGTHEN OUR COMMUNITIES AND NATION, AND WHEREAS, FREDDYE DAVIS, PRESIDENT

19:15:19 PROGRAMS, SERVING ON THE POLICE ADVISORY BOARD AND COLLABORATING WITH THE FREMONT POLICE DEPARTMENT FOR OVER 
19:15:24 25 YEARS, AND WORKING TIRELESSLY TO STAND FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EQUALITY.

19:15:32 NOW, THEREFORE, THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF FREMONT  RECOGNIZES THE ATTENTION TO COMMUNITY SERVICE, 
19:15:41 EQUALITY, AND SOCIAL JUSTICE OF DR. KING AND, THEREFORE, PROCLAIMS MARTIN LUTHER KING JR. DAY ON  JANUARY 17TH, 
19:15:46 2022 AS A DAY OF SERVICE AND RECOGNITION OF EQUALITY AND JUSTICE FOR THE FREMONT COMMUNITY AND CALL 
19:15:54 UPON THE PEOPLE OF THE COMMUNITY TO PAY TRIBUTE TO THE LIFE AND WORKS OF DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. THROUGH

19:16:07 AND I WANTED TO SAY THAT ON BEHALF OF OUR ENTIRE CITY COUNCIL, THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE ADMIRED AND 
19:16:12 APPRECIATED, AND IT SPEAKS TO THE TRUE SPIRIT OF WHY WE ARE RECOGNIZING AND HONORING YOU.

19:16:20 AND SO I WANTED TO SEE IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO SHARE A FEW WORDS, ALANDA, ON BEHALF -- AND I DON'T KNOW IF FREDDYE

19:16:26 WOULD YOU LIKE TO SHARE A FEW WORDS?
>> OH, SURE.
ABSOLUTELY.

19:16:31 FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO GIVE MY REGARDS TO THE MAYOR, THE VICE MAYOR AND THE COUNCIL AND THE LEADERSHIP OF THE CITY 
19:16:36 OF FREMONT.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR INVITING US THIS EVENING, AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR 
19:16:42 THIS PROCLAMATION.
I BRING REGARDS FROM OUR PRESIDENT, FREDDYE DAVIS AND OUR EXECUTIVE 
19:16:49 COMMITTEE AND MEMBERS.
WE APPRECIATE THIS PROCLAMATION AND THE PARTNERSHIP OF THE CITY OF 
19:16:56 FREMONT, NOT JUST ON MARTIN LUTHER KING'S BIRTHDAY, BUT THROUGHOUT THE YEAR, SO WE WANT TO THANK YOU FOR 
19:17:03 THAT, AND APPLAUD YOUR EFFORTS IN THE COMMUNITY AS WELL.
HAYWARD SOUTH ALAMEDA COUNTY  NAACP 
19:17:14 HAS BEEN AROUND SINCE THE 1950s.
MRS. DAVIS HAS BEEN OUR PRESIDENT FOR OVER 20 YEARS, AND SHE HAD THE HONOR 
19:17:24 OF MARCHING WITH MARTIN LUTHER KING IN BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA AS A TEENAGER, SO THIS IS NEAR AND DEAR TO HER HEART, 
19:17:32 AND I APPRECIATE THE CITY OF FREMONT ALSO RECOGNIZING THE CIVIL RIGHTS IS STILL AN ISSUE IN OUR COUNTRY AND JUST 
19:17:41 PARTNERING WITH THE NAACP NOT JUST IN COMMUNITY SERVICE, BUT IN OUR FIGHT AGAINST CIVIL RIGHTS THROUGHOUT THE 
19:17:46 COMMUNITY.
AND I ALSO WANT TO CONGRATULATE OUR BRONZE MEDALIST, SO CONGRATULATIONS ON 
19:17:53 THAT HONOR AS WELL.
BUT WE WILL JOIN WITH YOU IN THE DAY OF COMMUNITY SERVICE AS STATED IN THE 
19:17:57 PROCLAMATION AND CONTINUE TO PARTNER WITH YOU THROUGHOUT THE YEAR.
SO THANKS AGAIN.

19:18:02 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
BLESSINGS TO YOU AND TO ALL THE MEMBERS.

19:18:07 IT WAS WONDERFUL TO JOIN ALL OF YOU FOR YOUR OPEN HOUSE, AND THAT THERE'S A CONTINUAL  OUTREACH AND PARTNERSHIP 
19:18:13 FOR MANY YEARS TO COME.
>> THANK YOU.
AND COUNCILMEMBER COX AS WELL.

19:18:22 >> Councilmember Cox: THANK YOU.
I JUST WANTED TO SAY TONIGHT MARKS A BIG MOMENT IN FREMONT THAT THIS IS THE 
19:18:29 FIRST TIME THAT OUR FREMONT CITY COUNCIL HAS PROCLAIMED DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING IN 66 YEARS DURING OUR 
19:18:36 CITY COUNCIL MEETING.
BUT IT TAKES A LOT OF EFFORT OF ALL OF US BEING SO DIVERSE, SO MANY PEOPLE 
19:18:44 THAT REPRESENT SO MANY DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES HERE IN FREMONT AND BEYOND, AND THAT IT REFLECTS WHAT DR. 
19:18:49 KING HAS DEVOTED HIS LIFE TO ADVANCING AN EQUITY, SOCIAL JUSTICE AND OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL.

19:19:00 AND I WANTED TO GIVE A SPECIAL SHOUT OUT TO MS. FREDDYE DAVIS, WHO'S BEEN SUCH A COURAGEOUS AND STRONG LEADER, 
19:19:09 AS WELL AS ALL OF THE MEMBERS OF THE NAACP CHAPTER OF THE HAYWARD SOUTH ALAMEDA COUNTY, THAT YOU HAVE FOUGHT 
19:19:19 CONTINUOUSLY TO UPHOLD THE JUSTICE AND TO BE THE VOICE TO GET THINGS DONE, AND BUILDING THE LONG PARTNERSHIPS 
19:19:25 HERE IN THE CITY OF FREMONT.
AS IT'S BEEN SPOKEN BEFORE, THAT MS. DAVIS HAS WORKED EXTENSIVELY WITH OUR 
19:19:38 PAST FIVE FREMONT POLICE CHIEFS AND WITH OUR ALAMEDA COUNTY D.A. ATTORNEY THAT HAS BEEN SPEAKING BOUNDS OF YEARS 
19:19:47 OF EXPERIENCE OF BRINGING SOCIAL JUSTICE AND DOING THE RIGHT THING, SO I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU SO MUCH 
19:19:55 FOR ALL OF THE WORK AND MUCH MORE NEEDS TO BE CONTINUED, AND IT GIVES ME GREAT HONOR TO HAVE WRITTEN THIS 
19:20:02 PROCLAMATION IN THE SPIRIT OF DR. KING, THAT ALL OF US ARE FIGHTING FOR ALL THE JUSTICE THAT WE NEED TO BRING OUT 
19:20:11 AND MAKE SURE THAT ANY INJUSTICE ANYWHERE IS AN INJUSTICE EVERYWHERE, BUT IT'S IN THE SPIRIT, BECAUSE I 
19:20:17 SERVED DURING THE WHITE HOUSE ON THE  DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING COMMISSION, AND WORKED WITH CORETTA SCOTT KING ALONG 
19:20:24 WITH HER CHILDREN, DEXTER AND MARTY AND BERNICE, TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES CARRIED 
19:20:32 OUT THE MISSION OF WHAT DR. KING IS ABOUT, AND ALSO WORKING CLOSELY WITH  DR. BENJAMIN HOOKS, LONG-STANDING 
19:20:41 FAMILY FRIEND OF THE NAACP WHO'S THE NATIONAL PRESIDENT, AND OTHERS, BECAUSE MY FAMILY HELPED FOUNDED NAACP 
19:20:49 AND MY GREAT GRANDPARENTS' HOME.
SO IT'S SOMETHING WE STILL HAVE TO CONTINUE TO WORK TOGETHER AND IN THE 
19:20:54 SPIRIT OF THE CITY OF THE FREMONT AND ALL OF OUR WONDERFUL WORK THAT WE'RE JOINING HANDS TO CONTINUE THE 
19:21:01 PARTNERSHIP WITH THE NAACP.
SO THANK YOU SO MUCH, AND I APPRECIATE ALL THAT YOU'RE DOING AND WE LOOK

>> Mayor Mei: NEXT I ALSO WANTED TO SHARE A PROCLAMATION BECAUSE FOR MANY 
19:21:39 YEARS, WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO JOIN TOGETHER IN PERSON TO CELEBRATE THE 45TH ANNUAL DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING JR. 
19:21:46 COMMEMORATION AND WE ACTUALLY DID THIS THIS WEEKEND TOO WITH THE AFRO-AMERICAN CULTURAL AND HISTORICAL 
19:21:50 SOCIETY AND I WANTED TO SHARE A PROCLAMATION TODAY IN HONOR OF THAT AND THEIR SPIRIT WITH THEIR 
19:22:01 LEADERSHIP, ESPECIALLY WITH JEANNE, AND SHE'S JOINED US TODAY.
SO WHEREAS THE SOCIETY HAS CELEBRATED 
19:22:06 THE LIFE AND WORKS OF MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. FOR THE PAST 45 YEARS, AND WHEREAS THE CITY OF FREMONT RECOGNIZES 
19:22:13 THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF DR. KING AS WELL AS THE WORK THAT THE AFRO AMERICAN CULTURAL AND HISTORICAL SOCIETY HAS 
19:22:19 DONE TO UPLIFT AND EDUCATE THE CITIZENS OF OUR COMMUNITY, AND WHEREAS,  DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. INSPIRED 
19:22:27 MILLIONS OF AMERICANS TO PARTICIPATE IN NON-VIOLENT PROTESTS TO SUPPORT THE IDEALS OF EQUALITY FOR ALL AND WAS A 
19:22:36 MOTIVATING FORCE BEHIND A CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT THAT HAD AS ITS GOAL THE CREATION OF A SOCIETY TOLERANT FOR ALL 
19:22:42 RACES OF ALL CULTURES AND NATIONALITIES, AND WHEREAS, THE CELEBRATION OF  DR. KING'S BIRTHDAY IS 
19:22:52 INTENDED AS A TIME FOR ALL AMERICANS TO REAFFIRM THEIR COMMITMENT TO THE BASIC PRINCIPLES THAT UNDERLIE OUR 
19:22:58 CONSTITUTION, EQUALITY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL.
AND SINCE 1994 IS DESIGNATED BY 
19:23:05 CONGRESS AS A NATIONAL DAY OF SERVICE, AND WHEREAS, THE CITY OF FREMONT ENJOYS A RICHNESS OF DIVERSITY IN ITS 
19:23:11 POPULATION, EMBRACING MANY ETHNIC AND RACIAL GROUPS AS PART OF BOTH THE CITY'S HISTORY AND ITS FUTURE.

19:23:19 AND WHEREAS, BOTH STATE AND NATIONAL OBSERVANCES ON THIS DAY WILL FOCUS ON THE IMPORTANCE OF INDIVIDUAL 
19:23:25 VOLUNTEERISM AND THE COMMITMENT TO COMMUNITY SERVICE AS A WAY TO BREAK DOWN SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC BARRIERS AND 
19:23:32 TO BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER TO FOCUS ON THEIR COMMON CONCERNS AND INTERESTS, AND WHEREAS THE IDEAS OF DR. MARTIN 
19:23:40 LUTHER KING, JR. AND THE CITY OF FREMONT COMMITMENT TO HUMAN RIGHTS ARE WORTHY OF REFLECTION AND SERVE AS A 
19:23:47 REMINDER THAT IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR ALL MEMBERS OF SOCIETY IS A RESPONSIBILITY OF EVERY MEMBER OF OUR 
19:23:52 SOCIETY.
NOW THEREFORE THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF FREMONT DOES  HEREBY RECOGNIZE

>> THANK YOU, MAYOR MEI.

19:24:30 ON BEHALF OF THE AFRO-AMERICAN CULTURAL AND HISTORICAL SOCIETY, I'M DELIGHTED TO ACCEPT THIS BEAUTIFUL 
19:24:37 PROCLAMATION.
OVER THE YEARS, WE HAVE RECEIVED PROCLAMATIONS FROM THE CITY OF FREMONT 
19:24:47 GOING BACK PERHAPS FOUR MAYORS, SO WE HAVE QUITE A FEW RECOGNITIONS FROM THE CITY OF FREMONT.

19:24:59 DR. KING LEFT US A LEGACY, HIS FAMILY LEFT US A LEGACY, AND ALL THE PEOPLE WHO MARCHED WITH HIM.

19:25:12 I HAVE RELATIVES AND FRIENDS WHO PARTICIPATED IN THAT GREAT  MOVEMENT.
WE CANNOT FORGET THAT DAY, WE CANNOT 
19:25:19 FORGET THE PRINCIPLES BEHIND THE MOVEMENT.
IT IS STILL MUCH NEEDED TODAY IN OUR 
19:25:26 SOCIETY.
IN ADDITION, I WOULD LIKE TO LET YOU KNOW THAT THE SOCIETY WILL BE HAVING 
19:25:37 ANOTHER EVENT ON FEBRUARY 12TH.
WE HAD PLANNED TO BE IN THE MAGNIFICENT FREMONT EVENT  CENTER, BUT 
19:25:44 DUE TO THE COVID CLIMATE, WE HAVE DECIDED THAT IT WILL BE VIRTUAL THIS YEAR.

19:25:53 AND THE NATIONAL THEME IS ON BLACK HEALTH AND WELLNESS.
BLACK HEALTH AND WELLNESS.

19:26:02 WE WILL HAVE SOME PHYSICIANS ADDRESSING THAT THEME.
AGAIN, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE HONOR 
19:26:08 THAT YOU HAVE EXTENDED THE AFRO-AMERICAN CULTURAL AND HISTORICAL SOCIETY.

19:26:12 THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU, MISS JEAN.
I ALSO WANTED TO SAY THAT IN THE 
19:26:20 SPIRIT OF PASTOR GARY HARRIS' MESSAGE, IT'S ABOUT LOVING THY NEIGHBOR AS WE LOVE THYSELF.

19:26:27 HOW WE ARE ABLE TO TAKE OURSELVES OUT OF THE COMFORT ZONE AND TO BE ABLE TO PUT OTHERS BEFORE US, AND SOMETIMES 
19:26:33 IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT EVERY HUMAN BEING IS VALUED AND APPRECIATED AND EVERYONE'S LIFE MATTERS AND THAT 
19:26:39 WE REALLY WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT WAS THE MESSAGE THAT HE SHARED AND HOW WE'RE WONDERFULLY AND UNIQUELY MADE, 
19:26:45 SO THANK YOU FOR THAT.
COUNCILMEMBER COX, YOU HAVE YOUR HAND UP?

19:26:57 >> Councilmember Cox: YES, I COULD NOT RESIST, BUT I SHALL.
I WANT TO FIRST THANK JEAN  FICKLIN 
19:27:04 AND ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE SOCIETY FOR CELEBRATING THE LIFE OUR COMMUNITY FOR OVER 45 YEARS, AND IF YOU DO THE MATH, 
19:27:15 THIS IS WAY BEFORE DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING HOLIDAY CAME INTO BEING IN 1994.
AND THAT BECAUSE OF THIS WONDERFUL 
19:27:23 ORGANIZATION, THEY GIVE COLLEGE SCHOLARSHIPS TO WONDERFUL STUDENTS IN OUR COMMUNITY, AND I COULDN'T HELP BUT 
19:27:33 ACKNOWLEDGE THAT OUR VERY OWN FREMONT CITY MANAGER, KARENA SHACKELFORD, WAS A RECIPIENT OF THE SOCIETY'S COLLEGE 
19:27:42 SCHOLARSHIP, AND YOU NEVER KNOW WHO MAY BE RUNNING THE CITIES OR THE GOVERNMENT IN OUR AREAS, AND THIS IS A 
19:27:49 REFLECTION OF THE ORGANIZATION OF THE AFRO-AMERICAN CULTURAL AND HISTORICAL SOCIETY, WHICH I HAVE GIVEN OVER THE 
19:27:59 YEARS AND ALSO FULLY SUPPORTED.
I REMEMBER WHEN JEAN WAS SO PROUD TO ACKNOWLEDGE KARENA MANY TIMES, AND 
19:28:07 WHEN KARENA IS ABLE TO COME AND IT'S JUST BEEN VERY HEARTWARMING TO SEE THAT THE SCHOLARSHIP HAS COME TO 
19:28:13 SOMEBODY SO WORTHY WITH GREAT LEADERSHIP AND SUCH TALENT THAT'S NOW LEADING OUR CITY OF FREMONT.

19:28:23 IN ADDITION, RECOGNIZING THAT AS YOU BROUGHT UP, JEAN, ABOUT THE EVENT DOWNTOWN CENTER, WE KNOW CORETTA SCOTT 
19:28:40 KING WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR OVER 33 YEARS TO WALK UP AND DOWNTURNED NO A HOLIDAY FOR HONORING DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING 
19:28:45 AND I'M HAPPY TO SHARE WITH OUR CITY COUNCIL WE APPROVED BACK IN NOVEMBER THE 16TH AT OUR FORMAL CITY COUNCIL 
19:28:53 MEETING THAT CORETTA SCOTT  KING'S QUOTE IS NOW WRITTEN AND WILL BE WRITTEN ON THE WALL OF OUR FREMONT

19:29:12 COUNCIL BUT ALSO RECOGNIZING AS THE QUOTE, WE HAVE GONE FULL CIRCLE AND WILL CONTINUE TO CELEBRATE THROUGHOUT 
19:29:20 THE YEAR OF DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING'S  TEACHINGS, AND A SUMMARY, I'M GOING TO JUST SAY THIS BECAUSE WE ARE HAVING AN 
19:29:25 INITIATIVE WITH THE CITY OF FREMONT ON OUR WEBSITE ABOUT DIVERSITY, EQUITY AND INCLUSION, AND DIVERSITY IS HAVING 
19:29:34 A SEAT AT THE TABLE, INCLUSION IS HAVING A VOICE, AND BELONGING IS HAVING THAT VOICE BE HEARD.

19:29:45 LET US ALL CELEBRATE DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING, AND PAY TRIBUTE BECAUSE IT'S A DAY WHEN ALL PEOPLE OF ALL RACES, 
19:29:53 RELIGIONS, CLASSES AND STATIONS OF LIFE PUT TOGETHER THEIR DIFFERENCES AND JOIN IN THE SPIRIT OF  TOGETHERNESS, 
19:30:02 AND TO LOVE, NOT HATE, BUT ALSO REAFFIRM THE IDEALS OF WHAT IT MEANS TO HAVE SOCIAL JUSTICE, EQUITY, 
19:30:09 DIVERSITY, AND INCLUSION, AND AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL AMERICANS AND ESPECIALLY IN THE CITY OF FREMONT.

19:30:16 SO THANK YOU SO MUCH, JEAN, FOR ALL YOUR WONDERFUL LEADERSHIP AND DRIVING.

19:30:21 WE LOVE YOU, ALL OF US LOVE YOU HERE AT CITY COUNCIL AND WE JUST APPRECIATE ALL THAT YOU'RE DOING AND JUST KNOW 
19:30:28 THAT ALL YOUR  WORKS AND THE ORGANIZATION IS STILL LIVING IN SO MANY WAYS OF HOW YOU REACHED OUT IN 
19:30:34 THE COMMUNITY.
SO THANK YOU AGAIN, AND YOU WOULD NOT BELIEVE SHE TURNED -- EVERYBODY KNOWS 
19:30:39 THIS FROM LAST YEAR, I WENT TO HER DRIVE-THRU BIRTHDAY PARTY.
SHE TURNED 90 LAST YEAR.

19:30:47 AND SHE DOESN'T LOOK A DAY OLD THAN ABOUT 30 YEARS BACK IT UP.
SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT SHE DOES BUT SHE 
19:30:55 DOES A PHENOMENAL JOB OF KEEPING THINGS IN ORDER, AND  DOING THINGS CONTINUOUSLY WITH A PASSION OF LOVE 
19:31:03 TOWARDS OUR COMMUNITY, SO THANK YOU SO MUCH, JEAN.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU, MISS JEAN.

19:31:10 TO LOVE AND BE LOVED IS TRULY THE GREATEST JOY ON EARTH, SO THE FACT YOU'VE BEEN A SOLID PARTNER FOR NOT 
19:31:17 JUST THE AFRO-AMERICAN CULTURAL SOCIETY BUT FOR SO MANY YEARS WITH CBC, SOUTH BAY CHINESE CLUB AND OTHER GROUPS I 
19:31:20 THINK THAT CLEARLY BRINGS THE BOND OF OUR COMMUNITY TOGETHER.
SO THANK YOU.

19:31:26 AND HOPE THAT YOU ARE WELL AND STAY HEALTHY.
>> THANK YOU.

19:31:37 >> Mayor Mei: BLESSINGS TO YOU.
NEXT WE HAVE PUBLIC COMMUNICATIONS AND I BELIEVE WE HAVE SEVERAL SPEAKERS WE 
19:31:42 WILL GO AHEAD AND CALL THE SPEAKERS AT THAT TIME.
>> Ms. Gauthier: UNDER ORAL 
19:31:46 COMMUNICATIONS.
>> Mayor Mei: PUBLIC COMMUNICATIONS, OPEN PUBLIC COMMUNICATIONS AT THIS 
19:31:50 TIME.
AND IT'S ON ANY PERSON WISHING TO SPEAK ON AN ITEM NOT  SCHEDULED ON THE 
19:31:59 AGENDA THIS EVENING. MAY DO SO UNDER PUBLIC COMMUNICATIONS.
AND IF YOU COULD PRESS STAR NINE OR 
19:32:11 RAISE YOUR HAND.
>> Ms. Gauthier: BLAIR BEEKMAN.
>> HI, BLAIR BEEKMAN HERE.

19:32:21 THANKS FOR YOUR INTRODUCTORY THINGS TODAY.
I ASSUME I'M GETTING THREE MINUTES FOR 
19:32:24 PUBLIC COMMENT.
>> Ms. Gauthier: FOR PUBLIC COMMENT, IT'S THREE MINUTES.

19:32:29 >> THANK YOU.
YEAH.
SO THANK YOU FOR THE INTRODUCTORY 
19:32:36 ITEMS TONIGHT.
I'VE BEEN NOTICING THAT THE MAJOR LARGE BAY AREA CITIES AT THIS TIME, 
19:32:42 SAN FRANCISCO, OAKLAND AND SAN JOSÉ, HAVE BEEN KIND OF INUNDATED WITH NEW LAW ENFORCEMENT AND SURVEILLANCE AND 
19:32:52 TECHNOLOGY QUESTIONS.
AND IT'S BEEN KIND OF  INTERESTING.
IT BEEN A LOT TO ADJUST TO.

19:33:02 THE QUESTIONS, ALTHOUGH ARE DEEP AND NEEDED, I STILL THINK THAT IT'S THE IDEAS OF REIMAGINE, RACIAL EQUITY, 
19:33:11 HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, OPEN PUBLIC POLICIES AND ACCOUNTABILITY THAT CAN REALLY HELP ADDRESS THESE NEW LAW 
19:33:20 ENFORCEMENT QUESTIONS AND SURVEILLANCE QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME.
WE'RE AT AN INTERESTING SPOT TO REALLY 
19:33:25 START TO BRING ALIVE THE IDEAS OF REIMAGINE CAN BE REALLY IMPORTANT FOR OURSELVES.

19:33:30 AND REALLY BRINGS OUT THE BETTER PARTS OF OURSELVES, WHAT EXACTLY REIMAGINE CAN BE AT THIS TIME.

19:33:39 HOW TO BRING IN HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES OUT OF THE LAW ENFORCEMENT QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME, I THINK IT'S 
19:33:44 IMPORTANT AND I THINK WE'RE GOING TO LEARN IMPORTANT LESSONS AS LOCAL COMMUNITIES HOW TO BUILD THAT AT THIS 
19:33:53 TIME.
GOOD LUCK HOW WE CAN DO THAT, AND THANK YOU, I GUESS THAT'S ABOUT ALL I 
19:33:58 HAVE TO SAY ON THAT ITEM FOR NOW.
I'M GOING TO CONTINUE WORKING ON THAT ITEM AND I HOPE WE ALL CAN.

19:34:06 WITH A MINUTE 30, I WANTED TO QUICKLY MENTION GOOD LUCK IN THE PREPAREDNESS PRACTICES NEEDED FOR THE NEXT FEW 
19:34:17 WEEKS TO REALLY STAVE OFF THIS CURRENT OMICRON VARIATION FOR THIS WINTER.
I THINK WE'RE ALL HOPING BY EARLY MID 
19:34:27 JANUARY IF WE DO GOOD PRACTICES NOW, WE CAN BE IN OKAY SHAPE AND HAVE A GOOD REPORT OUT TO THE PUBLIC WHAT WE'LL BE 
19:34:35 EXPECTING FROM MID FEBRUARY ONWARD.
I HOPE AS A CITY COUNCIL, YOU'LL HAVE THOSE SORT OF PUBLIC MEETINGS, AS MANY 
19:34:42  BAY AREA CITIES CAN, AND WE CAN HAVE A GOOD IMPORTANT COURSE OF WHAT TO EXPECT FOR THE REST OF FEBRUARY, MARCH 
19:34:50 AND APRIL ABOUT WHAT TO EXPECT OF OMICRON.
IN THE MEANTIME, WE JUST HAVE TO 
19:34:55 CONTINUE THE MASK USE AND JUST PRACTICE GOOD PRACTICES AT THIS TIME FOR THE NEXT FEW WEEKS.

19:35:08 GOOD LUCK HOW WE CAN DO THAT.
AND I JUST -- THANKS FOR YOUR TIME, AND I HOPE WHATEVER CHOICES WE HAVE, 
19:35:12 WE CAN WORK IT OUT IN FRIENDLY TERMS HERE AND WE'RE TRYING TO DO THAT, AND THANK YOU FOR THAT.

19:35:31 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
NEXT SPEAKER IS MR. JOHN H HINDS.
WELCOME.

19:35:40 >> Mayor Mei: MR. HINDS, IF YOU COULD UNMUTE YOURSELF?
>> CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW?

19:35:42 >> Mayor Mei: YES, I CAN.
>> AWESOME.
THANK YOU.

19:35:51 HELLO, EVERYONE, AND HAPPY NEW YEAR.
MY QUESTION TONIGHT IS, WHAT IF THE TOD AND TRANSIT DISAPPEARED?

19:35:57 TWO YEARS AGO, MANY OF US GOT A CRASH COURSE IN WORKING FROM HOME.
LOTS OF INFRASTRUCTURE GOT BUILT AND 
19:36:02 EMPLOYERS GOT TO SEE HOW THIS COULD WORK OUT.
THAT VERDICT IS NOW IN AND MANY OF 
19:36:08 THOSE EMPLOYERS ARE MAKING PERMANENT DECISIONS.
THE ONE COMPANY I WORKED FOR IN SAN 
19:36:12 FRANCISCO CLOSED ITS ONLY OFFICE LAST MONTH.
ALL OF ITS EMPLOYEES WILL BE WORKING 
19:36:17 FROM HOME AND THOSE COMMUTES WON'T HAPPEN NOW.
A SECOND COMPANY I WORK FOR IN 
19:36:24 EMERYVILLE IS CLOSING ITS OFFICES THIS MONTH, AND MOVING TO A SMALLER ONE WITH JUST 20% OF THE SQUARE FOOTAGE OF 
19:36:30 THE OLD ONE BECAUSE THEIR EMPLOYEES DON'T WANT TO COME IN.
FOR PEOPLE WHOSE WORK REQUIRES THEIR 
19:36:33 PHYSICAL PRESENCE.
THE OTHER 80% WON'T EVEN HAVE AN OFFICE TO GO TO.

19:36:40 THIS PICTURE IS PLAYING OUT AT COMPANY AFTER COMPANY NOW AND THE EFFECTS ON COMMUTE PATTERNS ARE SIGNIFICANT.

19:36:49 WE'RE SEEING THE ROADS AND BRIDGES FILLING UP SOME, PEOPLE THAT PREFER CARS FOR GETTING AROUND, BUT PUBLIC 
19:36:57 TRANSIT HAS BEEN A DIFFERENT STORY.
I'VE BEEN TAKING BART FOR A FEW MONTHS NOW BECAUSE -- EVEN NOW THEIR 
19:37:01 RIDERSHIP IS 10 OR 15% OF WHAT IT USED TO BE.
A WHOLE LOT OF COMMUTES AREN'T 
19:37:06 HAPPENING NOW.
BART WILL PLACE OF BUSINESS BLI GET ITS RIDERSHIP BACK UP TO 50% SOMEDAY 
19:37:15 AND WILL NEED BIGGER SUBSIDIES, IN CONTRAST, AMTRAK CAPITOL CORRIDOR DOESN'T HAVE THOSE ADVANTAGES AND IT'S 
19:37:21 PROBABLY JUST TOAST.
WHEN I WALK PAST THE STATION BEFORE COVID I USED TO SEE 10 TO 15 PEOPLE 
19:37:27 GETTING OFF THEIR MORNING TRAIN, NOW IT'S MORE LIKE ONE OR ZERO.
AND THAT'S WITH FEWER TRAINS RUNNING.

19:37:33 AT SOME POINT THE AGENCIES THAT HAVE BEEN SUBSIDIZING IT WILL MOVE THEIR MONEY ELSEWHERE AND THE SERVICE WILL 
19:37:38 END.
WHERE THAT AFFECTS THE CITY IS IN THE PLANNING OF NEW TODs.

19:37:43 THOSE THAT ARE ANCHORED ON A BART STATION MIGHT STILL MAKE SENSE BUT WE SHOULD CONSIDER WHAT THAT EVEN MEANS 
19:37:52 WHEN BART USAGE IS PERMANENTLY REDUCED BY SO MUCH.
BUT TODs ANCHORED ON AN AMTRAK STATION 
19:37:57 LIKE THE PROPOSAL FOR ARDENWOOD REALLY NEED TO INCLUDE A PLAN B FOR WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE TRANSIT IS CANCELED 
19:38:05 AND THE RESIDENTS AND BUSINESSES THERE BECOME COMPLETELY DEPENDENT ON CARS FOR WHATEVER TRIPS THEY DO MAKE.

19:38:12 IF WE HAVEN'T PROVIDED ADEQUATE PARKING OR ROAD CAPACITY THEN WE WILL HAVE CREATED A BRAND NEW SHINING MESS THAT 
19:38:19 WILL LAST FOR DECADES.
THE KEY POINT HERE IS THE COMMUTING ASSUMPTIONS THAT  UNDERLIE OUR TOD 
19:38:26 PLANNING HAVE BEEN SUDDENLY AND COMPLETELY OVERTAKEN BY EVENTS, AND WE NEED TO RE-ASSESS THOSE NOW FROM 
19:38:32 SCRATCH.
THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU,  MR. HINDS, 
19:38:37 FOR YOUR COMMENTS.
AT THIS TIME --
>> Ms. Gauthier: MR. ABREU JUST RAISED 
19:38:40 HIS HAND.
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY.
I DID NOT SEE THAT BEFORE.

19:38:51 KELLY, GOOD EVENING.
COULD YOU UNMUTE YOUR MIC, PLEASE?
>> SO WE JUST HEARD A PLEA FOR PLENTY 
19:38:57 OF PARKING, AND QUESTIONING THE FOUNDATIONS OF TRANSIT-ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT.

19:39:05 AND JUST LAST NOVEMBER, WE HEARD A COUNCILMEMBER SPECIFICALLY POINT TO THE 40 SPACES AT MISSION PEAK AND 
19:39:15 DECRY THAT THE GOVERNMENT AGENCY THERE, THE PARK DISTRICT IS GIVING AWAY 40 FREE PARKING SPACES.

19:39:22 SOMEHOW THERE'S SUCH A SHORT-TERM MEMORY ON THIS COUNCIL, AND ON THE CITY MANAGEMENT, THAT THE CITY CAN'T 
19:39:32 REMEMBER BACK A COUPLE YEARS AGO WHEN THE CITY GAVE AWAY 500 OR 1,000 PARKING SPACES ON STANFORD AVENUE, ON 
19:39:42 VINEYARD AVENUE, ON WEIBEL DRIVE, ON ANTELOPE DRIVE, ON COUGAR CIRCLE, ON LYNX DRIVE.

19:39:52 THE CITY CAN'T REMEMBER GIVING AWAY A THOUSAND PARKING SPACES ALL THROUGH THE NEIGHBORHOOD TO CERTAIN PEOPLE WHO 
19:39:55 ARE  PRIVILEGED TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF GETTING A PARKING PERMIT.

19:40:05 SO FREE PARKING FOR SOME, IN THE HUNDREDS, IN THE THOUSANDS OF PARKING SPACES.

19:40:12 BUT ALL OF A SUDDEN IT'S A PROBLEM TO GIVE AWAY 40 TO ANYBODY WHO DRIVES IN AND WANTS TO WALK IN A PARK.

19:40:28 THIS KIND OF ONE SIDED, OF, YOU KNOW, FAVORITISM IS DESPICABLE, AND THE CITY NEEDS TO -- IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE 
19:40:36 ANTIPARKING, DON'T BE GIVING IT AWAY, AND DON'T POINT FINGERS AT OTHER AGENCIES THAT WHEN YOU YOURSELF ARE 
19:40:40 DOING FAR WORSE IN FAVORITISM WHEN IT COMES TO PARKING.
THANK YOU.

19:40:50 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
NEXT I THINK I'M GOING TO CLOSE THE PUBLIC COMMENT, AND NEXT WE'LL BRING 
19:41:04 IT BACK TO THE ITEMS THAT WERE PULLED FROM THE  AGENDA, I BELIEVE.
WE'LL START WITH 2C AND WE'LL GIVE TWO 
19:41:08 MINUTES FOR EACH OF THESE, PLEASE.
>> Ms. Gauthier: BLAIR BEEKMAN RAISED HIS HAND ON THIS ITEM.

19:41:19 >> Mayor Mei: THIS IS FOR THE ITEM AB361 CONSIDER BEING MAKING FINDINGS TO ALLOW THE CITY COUNCIL AND 
19:41:25 LEGISLATIVE BODIES OF THE CITY TO CONTINUE HOLDING MEETINGS VIA VIDEO CONFERENCE PURSUANT TO AB361.

19:41:27 >> HI.
THANK YOU.
BLAIR BEEKMAN HERE.

19:41:32 WE HAD THIS CONVERSATION THE LAST TIME I SPOKE AT PUBLIC COMMENT IN DECEMBER.

19:41:38 I WROTE YOURSELVES SOME LETTERS RECENTLY YESTERDAY ABOUT THE SUBJECT.
I HOPE WE CAN CONTINUE TO WORK ON THE 
19:41:45 SUBJECT TO BE A WORK IN PROGRESS.
A FEW SHORT WORDS ON IT TODAY.
AS APPROVING THE CONTINUING OF HYBRID 
19:41:53 PUBLIC MEETINGS AT LOCAL AREA PUBLIC MEETINGS CAN BE IMPORTANT TO TERMS OF COMMUNITY PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY, I 
19:42:02 HOPE THE PUBLIC COMMENT TIME WILL  BE -- ITEMS TO ALLOW THE PUBLIC THEIR OWN ATTEMPTS AT RESPONSIBLE INFORMATION 
19:42:10 PLANNING AND SHARING AROUND COMMUNITY PUBLIC HEALTH DURING THIS PANDEMIC AND THE OMICRON.

19:42:13 THANK YOU.
I GUESS THAT'S ABOUT ALL FOR NOW.
I HOPE WE CAN CONTINUE TO TALK AND 
19:42:21 HAVE DIALOGUE ON THE SUBJECT AND I CAN BE ABLE TO OFFER A FEW IDEAS AROUND COMMUNITY SAFETY ISSUES ON COVID WHEN 
19:42:25 THESE SORT OF ISSUES COME UP AS AGENDA  ITEMS IN THE FUTURE.
THANK YOU.

19:42:34 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
CAN I GET A MOTION FROM THE COUNCIL OR -- FOR ITEM 2C.

19:42:38 >> Councilmember Jones: SO  MOVED.
>> Mayor Mei: MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER JONES, SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER YANG 
19:42:41 SHAO.
MOVED AND SECONDED.
ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE.

19:42:52 THANK YOU.
>> COUNCILMEMBER COX, AYE, COUNCILMEMBER SHAO, AYE, COUNCILMEMBER 
19:42:59 KASSAN, AYE, COUNCILMEMBER JONES, AYE, COUNCILMEMBER KENG, AYE, VICE MAYOR SALWAN, AYE.

19:43:06 MAYOR MEI, AYE.
THE MOTION PASSES UNANIMOUSLY FOR ITEM 2C AS IN CAT.

19:43:15 NEXT IS ITEM 2D, WHICH IS THE MULTIPURPOSE SENIOR SERVICES PROGRAM, MSSP, AND THE CONTRACT AMENDMENT TO 
19:43:24 ADOPT A RESOLUTION AUTHORIZING THE CITY MANAGER TO CUTE THE FISCAL YEAR 2021-2022 CONTRACT AMENDMENT FOR 
19:43:32 CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT ON AGING TO PROVIDE MULTIPURPOSE SENIOR SERVICES AND MAKING FINDINGS ON THE CEQA 
19:43:35 EXCEPTION.
MR. BEEKMAN, YOU HAD PULLED THIS ITEM?

19:43:42 >> I PULLED ITEM E.
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY, SO NOT 2D.
>> NO, IT WAS ITEM E.

19:43:50 >> Mayor Mei: OKAY.
DID WE NOT PASS THIS EARLIER, SUSAN?
I APOLOGIZE.

19:43:58 MS. GAUTHIER?
>> Ms. Gauthier: SORRY, LET ME CHECK.
I DIDN'T HAVE D ON MY LIST -- I MEAN, 
19:44:02 SORRY, IT WASN'T ON MY LIST OF ITEMS BEING PULLED.
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY, MY  APOLOGIES.

19:44:12 NEXT IS ITEM 2E AS IN EDWARD.
WHICH IS SENECA FAMILY AGENCY SUBCONTRACT FOR JUVENILE JUSTICE 
19:44:21 SERVICES, TO AUTHORIZE AND EXECUTE A CONTRACT FOR SENECA FAMILY OF AGENCIES FOR THE PROVISION OF TRAUMA FOCUSED 
19:44:26 COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL GROUPS AND PARENTING CLASSES AS PART OF OUR CITY'S MASTER CONTRACT WITH THE 
19:44:34 ALAMEDA COUNTY PROBATION FOR THE PERIOD OF JULY 2021 THROUGH JUNE 2023.
AND I KNOW THAT WE ALSO HAVE MISS 
19:44:40 BAILEY ON THE CALL, AND THANK THEM FOR THEIR PARTNERSHIP AND SERVICE.
MR. BEEKMAN, YOU HAD A COMMENT ON 
19:44:44 THIS?
>> YEAH, I DID.
I JUST -- I SAW THIS AND IT JUST GAVE 
19:44:53 ME A QUICK REMINDER THAT, YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT USED TO BE CALLED, BUT WE'RE NOW CALLING THESE THINGS 
19:44:58 IDEAS OF REIMAGINE AND HOW WE CAN ADDRESS THE CONCEPTS OF REIMAGINE AT THIS TIME IS IMPORTANT TO ME.

19:45:09 I THINK WE'RE GOING UNDER A NEW LAW ENFORCEMENT SYSTEM THAT TO FIND IDEAS OF REIMAGINE, IT COULD BE REAL HELPFUL 
19:45:13 TO MYSELF RIGHT NOW AND THAT'S WHAT THIS ITEM DOES.
I WANTED TO POINT THAT OUT AND MENTION 
19:45:19 IT AND THANK YOURSELVES FOR THIS WORK THAT THIS IS SOME OF THE BETTER WORK WE CAN DO AS LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND 
19:45:22 COMMUNITY.
THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:45:27 AND I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IF THERE'S A MOTION.
I WANTED TO THANK ANNIE BAILEY AN THE 
19:45:34 PARTNERSHIP THAT WE'VE HAD FROM OUR FREMONT FAMILY RESOURCE CENTER AND SENECA FAMILY AGENCIES.

19:45:40 IT'S A CONTINUATION OF LONG-STANDING POLICIES THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO SUPPORT AND ENHANCE IN PROVIDING THAT 
19:45:44 SERVICE FOR THE JUVENILES AND THEIR FAMILIES.
>> Councilmember Cox: SO MOVED.

19:45:47 >> Mayor Mei: MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER COX, SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER JONES.

19:46:05 COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, AYE.
COUNCILMEMBER JONES, AYE.
COUNCILMEMBER KENG, AYE.

19:46:11 VICE MAYOR SALWAN, AYE.
MAYOR MEI, AYE.
THE MOTION PASSES UNANIMOUSLY.

19:46:20 NEXT IS ITEM 2G, I BELIEVE, AS IN GEORGE.
TO ACCEPT AND APPROPRIATE BAY AREA 
19:46:27 WASI GRANT FUNDS FOR SEARCH AND RESCUE EQUIPMENT.
THIS IS SPECIFICALLY FOR $14,408 FOR 
19:46:36 EQUIPMENT THAT'S NECESSARY FOR THAT.
I BELIEVE IF I REMEMBER LOOKING AT THE ITEM IS MORE GLOVES AND OTHER ASSORTED 
19:46:42 THINGS NEEDED FOR OUR DEPARTMENT AND I SEE THAT OUR CHIEF OF FIRE, CHIEF CURTIS JACOBSON, WELCOME, HAPPY NEW 
19:46:48 YEAR, IS ALSO ON THE CALL IN CASE THERE'S ANY QUESTIONS.
SO I BELIEVE MR. BEEKMAN, YOU PULLED 
19:46:53 THIS ITEM?
>> YEAH, HI.
BLAIR BEEKMAN HERE.

19:47:03 THIS ITEM WAS OF INTEREST TO MYSELF NOT ONLY AS RESCUE EQUIPMENT AND WORKING WITH FIRE AND EMERGENCY SERVICES THAT 
19:47:12 I THINK HAVE BECOME A MUCH IMPORTANT CONCEPT AT THIS TIME, RATHER THAN TERRORIST PLANNING SO MUCH.

19:47:22 IT'S ALSO A TIME THAT THIS IS ON YOUR JANUARY AGENDA ITEMS BECAUSE I THINK BAY WASI HAS CHANGED THEIR BUDGETING 
19:47:29 AND PLANNING PRACTICES A BIT.
THAT SHOULD BE NOTED.
THEY ARE TRYING TO LEAVE THE ERA OF 
19:47:35 9/11 AND MOVE MORE INTO AN  ERA OF COMMUNITY AND PIECE AND THE IDEAS OF EMERGENCY PLANNING.

19:47:46 FOR COMMUNITY.
SO IT JUST NICE TO SEE THIS ITEM HERE AT THIS TIME, AND GOOD  LUCK, THERE 
19:47:51 CAN BE SOME FEDERAL AUSPICES TO LAW ENFORCEMENT THINGS THAT ARE GOING ON AT THIS TIME.

19:47:59 YOU CAN ASK BAY WASI FOR HELP AND GUY DENSE FOR GOOD QUESTIONS ABOUT COMMUNITY SERVICES AT THIS TIME.

19:48:11 >> Mayor Mei: SO THANK YOU, AND THIS IS FUND 199 AND I BELIEVE THIS IS FOR THE EQUIPMENT THAT'S VERY MUCH NEEDED BY

19:49:16 >> YEAH, HI.

19:49:28 TECHNOLOGY DEVICES.
TO HAVE GOOD OVERSIGHT IS ALWAYS PORP AND MENTION AT THIS TIME I HOPE TO BE 
19:49:32 OF HELP TO US ALL.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
JUST TO REAFFIRM, I BELIEVE IT'S FOR 
19:49:37 THE SECURITY OF THE FREMONT FAMILY RESOURCE CENTER ITSELF ONGOING, IT'S NOT SOMETHING SPECIAL, IT'S THE 
19:49:41 REGULAR MAINTENANCE WE HAVE, IT'S NOT SOMETHING UNUSUAL, IT'S A STANDARD CONTRACT FOR US TO PROVIDE SERVICES 
19:49:48 FOR THAT.
SO CAN I GET A MOTION, PLEASE, BY VICE MAYOR SALWAN, SECONDED BY 
19:49:53 COUNCILMEMBER JONES.
EVERYONE IS VERY HAPPY TO HELP, SO THAT'S GOOD.

19:50:02 CAN I GET A ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE.

19:50:13 COUNCILMEMBER KENG, AYE.
VICE MAYOR SALWAN, AYE.
MAYOR MEI, AYE.

19:50:27 THE MOTION PASSES UNANIMOUSLY.
NEXT IS ITEM 2J, TO AUTHORIZE THE CITY MANAGER TO DESIGNATE AND ISSUE A 
19:50:35 PURCHASE ORDER WITH STARCHASE IN THE AMOUNT NOT TO EXCEED $193,000.

TWO SPEAKERS ON THIS ITEM.

19:50:53 >> Ms. Gauthier: MR. ABREU.
>> Mayor Mei: ABREU, YES.
>> HI, BLAIR BEEKMAN HERE.

19:50:59 I THINK I SPOKE ON ITEM I AND I COMBINED I AND J, SO I DON'T HAVE TO SPEAK ON THIS ITEM.

19:51:02 THANK YOU.
>> Ms. Gauthier: THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:51:15 MR. ABREU, WELCOME.
>> I'D LIKE -- ON THIS REPORT IS THE PIECE OF HARDWARE, PROJECTILE 
19:51:22 LAUNCHER, AND EACH ONE COSTS ABOUT $7,000.
GIVEN THAT AN AVERAGE POLICE CAR ONLY 
19:51:27 LASTS TWO OR THREE OR FOUR YEARS, THEY TURN OVER FAIRLY QUICKLY, WHAT IS THE FATE OF THAT LAUNCHER?

19:51:32 DO THEY GET RECYCLED INTO OTHER CARS OR NOT?
IT'S NOT AT ALL CLEAR IN THE REPORT.

19:51:38 BULL THE REPORT DOES MAKE A BOLD PROMISE.
IT DOES PROMISE TO REDUCE THE NUMBER 
19:51:45 OF POLICE PURSUITS.
OF COURSE YOU KNOW, HOW DO WE KNOW -- WHAT IS THAT NUMBER?

19:51:51 WHAT IS THE BASELINE NUMBER?
HOW ARE WE GOING TO -- IS IT GOING TO REDUCE IT BY 1% OR BY, YOU KNOW, 50%?

19:51:59 WHAT IS THE REAL -- HOW ARE WE GOING TO MEASURE THAT PERFORMANCE?
AND THEN FINALLY, THE ENVIRONMENTAL 
19:52:05 REVIEW, THIS IS A TRAVESTY.
THE ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW IS ACTING AS IF THIS IS A PIECE OF SOFTWARE.

19:52:11 THIS IS NOT SOFTWARE.
THIS IS HARDWARE.
AND THE ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW IS 
19:52:15 ENTIRELY INADEQUATE BECAUSE IT DOESN'T SEEM TO COMPREHEND WHAT IS --
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:52:21 THANK YOU.
ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COUNCIL OR A MOTION?

19:52:28 >> Councilmember Cox: SO MOVE.

19:53:02 THE LAST ITEM THAT WAS PULLED, I BELIEVE IS 2L AS IN LAUGH.
IT'S ACCESS POINT AND HOUSING RESOURCE 
19:53:06 CENTER SERVICE AGREEMENT.
AND IT'S TO AUTHORIZE THE CITY MANAGER OR THEIR DESIGNEE TO ENTER INTO AN 
19:53:11 AMENDMENT WITH THE COUNTY OF ALAMEDA FOR THE CITY TO PROVIDE ACCESS POINT AND HOUSING RESOURCE CENTER SERVICES 
19:53:24 IN THE AMOUNT OF $112,811.
I BELIEVE IT WAS PULLED BY  MR. BEEKMAN.

19:53:34 >> Ms. Gauthier: CORRECT.
>> HI, BLAIR BEEKMAN HERE, ITEM L.
I JUST WANTED TO THANK ADOBE 
19:53:37 SERVICES.
THINK THEY DO SOME REALLY INTERESTING WORK.

19:53:44 I LIVE IN THE FREMONT ISLANDER AREA, I WORK WITH THE FREMONT ISLANDER AREA, AND THEY'VE  JUST -- I'VE BEEN REALLY 
19:53:53 IMPRESSED WITH WHAT THEY CAN DO.
THANK YOU FOR THE MEETING TONIGHT.
I'M SORRY IF I PULLED SO MANY ITEMS.

19:53:57 I DID NOT WANT TO TAKE AWAY FROM SOMEBODY ELSE'S TIME.
I THINK NORMALLY THIS TIME SHOULD AT 
19:54:04 LEAST ALLOW FOR TWO MINUTES FOR EACH SPEAKER.
BECAUSE I PULLED SO MANY ITEMS, I WAS 
19:54:08 WILLING TO SPEAK FOR A MINUTE.
I HOPE THE OTHER PERSON HAD SOME THINGS INTERESTING TO SAY, I HOPE YOU 
19:54:12 CAN ALLOW TWO MINUTES IN THE FUTURE FOR THESE SORT OF ITEMS FOR PEOPLE.
THANK YOU.

19:54:21 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:57:25 IN TERMS OF STARTING A NEW YEAR WITH A NEW TEAM AND HOPEFULLY FOR CONTINUED SUCCESS AS WE RE-OPEN.

19:58:13 DEVELOPMENT ADVISORY COMMISSIONER FOR MONIQUE TORRES, WHO IS OUR COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL REPRESENTATIVE.

19:58:23 WE HAVE A PLANNING COMMISSIONER WHO IS FROM NORTHERN FREMONT, AND WE ALSO HAVE THE GEORGE W. PATTERSON HOUSE

WE ALSO HAVE THE GEORGE W. PATTERSON HOUSE ADVISORY BOARD, KAREN MUELLER, 
19:58:43 WHO IS THE REPRESENTATIVE FROM MISSION PEAK HERITAGE FOUNDATION.
AND THEN WE ALSO HAVE A REAPPOINTMENT 
19:58:47 OF OUR PLANNING COMMISSIONER REENA RAO.
IF I COULD GET A MOTION FOR  THAT?

19:58:51 >> Councilmember Cox: SO MOVED.

19:59:00 COX, SECONDED BY -- I SAW COUNCILMEMBER JONES' HAND BUT IT'S OKAY, I DON'T THINK HE'S GOING TO OBJECT, 
19:59:07 COUNCILMEMBER KENG.
SO MOVED AND SECONDED.
SO I THINK ROLL CALL, PLEASE.

19:59:14 >> Ms. Gauthier: COUNCILMEMBER COX, AYE.
COUNCILMEMBER SHAO, AYE.

19:59:21 COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, AYE.
COUNCILMEMBER JONES, AYE.
COUNCILMEMBER KENG, AYE.

19:59:30 VICE MAYOR SALWAN, AYE.
MAYOR MEI, AYE.
SO I JUST WANTED TO LET PEOPLE KNOW 
19:59:35 THAT WE DO THROUGHOUT THIS YEAR ALSO HAVE OTHER POSITIONS AND IN THE BEGINNING OF THE  YEAR, WE RESET THE 
19:59:40 APPLICATION PROCESS BY THE CITY MUNICIPAL RULES, SO IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN APPLYING FOR ANY OF THE 
19:59:46 OPEN POSITIONS, WHETHER IT'S THE SENIOR COMMISSIONS OR LIBRARY, AND I THINK THERE'S OTHER POSITIONS THAT ARE OPEN 
19:59:53 CURRENTLY, AND IF YOU COULD LOOK AT THAT ON OUR COMMISSIONS WEBSITE -- ON OUR CITY -- OR IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS, 
20:00:00 FEEL FREE, OUR CITY CLERK IS WONDERFULLY HELPFUL, SO SHE'S BEEN AN EXCELLENT RESOURCE ON THIS.

20:00:09 AT THIS TIME, I ALSO WANTED TO TURN IT OVER TO SEE IF THERE IS ORAL REPORTS ON MEETINGS AND EVENTS FOR WHICH OUR 
20:00:14  COUNCILMEMBERS SERVE ON DIFFERENT COMMISSIONS.
SO I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S SOMETHING 
20:00:20 THAT ANY OF THE COMMISSIONERS WANTED TO SHARE.
COUNCILMEMBER COX, IS THIS ON YOUR 
20:00:25 COMMISSION?
KOCH COX YES, IT IS.
IT'S ON THE EAST BAY COMMUNITY ENERGY, 
20:00:32 AND I WANTED TO REPORT OUT ON THE MEETING THAT TOOK PLACE LAST MONTH ON WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER THE 15TH.

20:00:46 AT PREVIOUS MEETINGS, I HAVE BEEN VERY VOCAL IN EXPRESSING THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING THE EAST BAY COMMUNITY ENERGY 
20:00:53 DO MORE IN SUPPLIER DIVERSITY PROGRAMS AND INCREASE CONTRACTING OPPORTUNITIES WITH LOCAL BUSINESSES, AND THE EAST 
20:01:03 BAY COMMUNITY ENERGY IS PART OF A CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY POWER WHICH IS CALLED CC POWER, AND IT'S A JOINT 
20:01:11 POWER AUTHORITY MADE UP OF 10 NORTHERN AND CENTRAL CALIFORNIAN COMMUNITY POWER ORGANIZATIONS THAT SUPPORT JOINT 
20:01:19 ACTIONS SO THAT YOU CAN GET VOLUME AND PROCURE LARGE CLEAN ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE.

20:01:27 SO OUR EAST BAY COMMUNITY ENERGY IS BASICALLY ONE OF THE FOUNDING MEMBERS OF THIS JOINT POWER AUTHORITY.

20:01:37 AND SO WHAT I WAS HAPPY TO REPORT AND THAT WAS PROPOSED BY THE STAFF AT EAST BAY COMMUNITY ENERGY WAS THAT THEY'RE 
20:01:46 SETTING UP TO INCLUDE TWO PREFERENCES, AND ONE IS FOR DISABLED VETERAN BUSINESS ENTITIES, AND ANOTHER IS FOR 
20:01:58 COMPANIES THAT ARE  LOCATED IN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES, AND IT'S BASED OFF OF THE CALIFORNIA EPA, THE 
20:02:06 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION  AGENCY'S STRUCTURE AND CRITERIA THAT MEETS THOSE AREAS, AND SO WITH THE 
20:02:17 CALIFORNIA PROPOSITION 209, IT DOES PROHIBIT SINCE IT DN PASS LAST YEAR OR I SHOULD SAY IN 2020, IT PROHIBITS 
20:02:23 FROM CONSIDERING ANY RACE, SEX,  COLOR, ETHNICITY OR NATIONAL ORIGIN OF ANY BUSINESSES.

20:02:30 SO BY ADDING THESE TWO PREFERENCES AND ALSO THEY HAVE ADDITIONALLY THE TRADITIONAL LOCAL PREFERENCES WHEN 
20:02:38 THEY EVALUATE CONTRACTING OPPORTUNITIES AND DOING AWARD, THAT THIS IS INCREASING THE OPPORTUNITIES OF HAVING 
20:02:45 SOME MORE SMALL BUSINESSES AWARDED THE BUSINESS OF THE EAST BAY COMMUNITY ENERGY ORGANIZATION.

20:02:54 SO I'M HAPPY TO REPORT THAT I HAD INITIATED AND DID A LOT TALK WITH SOME OF THE STAFF, BUT ALSO PASSING THE 
20:03:00 MOTION TO SUPPORT AN INCREASED CONTRACTING OPPORTUNITIES FOR SMALL BUSINESSES AND ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT 
20:03:08 ARE LOCATED IN  DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES ALONG WITH UNION LABOR ORGANIZATIONS AND DISABLED VETERAN 
20:03:13 BUSINESS ENTERPRISES.
SO I WAS HAPPY THAT IT PASSED UNANIMOUSLY, AND IT'S BEING 
20:03:23 IMPLEMENTED AND INCLUDED IN THEIR ANNUAL REPORTING EACH YEAR ON HOW THEY'RE MEASURED ON SUCCESS OF THIS.

20:03:27 SO I JUST WANTED TO REPORT ON THAT FROM LAST MONTH'S MEETING.
THANK YOU.

20:03:33 AND HAPPY NEW YEAR, EVERYONE.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
I'M VERY PROUD OF THE EAST BAY 
20:03:38 COMMUNITY ENERGY AND ITS CONTINUED PARTNERSHIP IN BEING PART OF THE COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATE PROGRAM, 
20:03:44 AND I KNOW OUR EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE HAS ALSO BEEN VERY STAUNCH SUPPORTERS OF ENSURING THAT WE CONTINUE THAT 
20:03:49 PARTNERSHIP AND IN PARTICULAR GIVING BACK TO THE COMMUNITY, WHICH IS UP WITH OF THE THINGS THAT MAKES IT A 
20:03:56 PROGRAM THAT'S UNIQUE IN TERMS OF NOT JUST BEING ENVIRONMENTALLY CONSCIOUS BUT ALSO CONSCIOUS OF THE FACT THAT AS 
20:04:02 WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS TODAY, ABOUT THE THEME, IS ABOUT BEING GOOD NEIGHBORS.

20:04:07 I ALSO WANTED TO SHARE, I KNOW ONE OF THE SPEAKERS TONIGHT TALKED ABOUT TRANSPORTATION AND PUBLIC TRANSIT AND, 
20:04:12 IN PARTICULAR, RAIL, AND I ALSO SERVE ON THE SAN JOAQUIN REGIONAL RAIL COMMISSION AND I WANTED TO SHARE THAT 
20:04:20 DURING THIS TIME PERIOD, SOME PEOPLE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO GET TO PUBLIC TRANSIT AND ONE OF THE DECISIONS THAT 
20:04:24 WAS MADE WAS TO KEEP THE FUNDING ON THE TICKETS.
SO THAT THEY WOULDN'T EXPIRE AND SO 
20:04:29 THAT NORMALLY THERE'S A TIME LIMIT ON SOME OF THE PAPER TICKETS, AND THEY'VE MADE THAT ADJUSTMENT TO ALLOW PEOPLE 
20:04:34 TO CONTINUE TO USE THOSE SO WHILE WE'RE SEEING SOME OF THE  RIDERSHIP RETURN, YOU MAY NOT SEE SOME OF THE FUNDING 
20:04:39 BECAUSE THEY'VE NOT HAD TO HAVE THOSE EXPIRE, WHICH I THINK IS IMPORTANT.
THE OTHER THING IS THAT THEY'RE 
20:04:47 LOOKING FOR ADDITIONAL TICKET OPPORTUNITIES, AND OUTREACH TO PARTICULAR STUDENTS AND ALSO THEIR 
20:04:51 CAPS PROGRAM, WHICH I THINK IS IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE TO NOTE THAT THEY'RE DOING COMMUNITY ASSISTANCE 
20:04:58 PROGRAM AND WE'VE ASKED THEM TO MAKE SURE AS PART OF IT THAT THEY TRY TO PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION IN MULTIPLE 
20:05:03 LANGUAGES AND ENSURING THAT PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS.
THEY'RE ALSO IN THE PROCESS IF PEOPLE 
20:05:09 ARE INTERESTED IN BIDDING ON THAT, THEY WILL BE LOOKING OVER THE NEXT YEAR OR TWO TO TALK ABOUT HOW WE REIMAGINE 
20:05:14 TICKETING, AND SOME OF THE PROCESSES.
SO THEY ARE LOOKING AT SOME OF THE PROCUREMENT OF THAT WITH OTHER 
20:05:17 AGENCIES.
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW IT'S A QUESTION OF SOME OF THE TICKET READERS ARE GETTING 
20:05:24 OLDER AND THEY'RE PAPER TICKETS AND SOME PEOPLE ARE TRANSITIONING TO THE APPS AND PROVIDING THAT ACCESS TO THE 
20:05:33 APPS BUT ALSO ENSURING THAT PEOPLE HAVE SOME -- THE RESOURCES WHO ARE NOT ON MOBILE APPLICATIONS HAVE CONTINUED 
20:05:37 ACCESS.
SO SPEAKING OF ACCESS, I ALSO WANTED TO UPDATE, I KNOW OUR CITY MANAGER AND 
20:05:45 I HAD A CHANCE TO CHAT ON THIS, WE WANTED TO JUST CLARIFY THAT FOR THE CRAB FEED, BECAUSE OF THE RISING OF 
20:05:51 THE OMICRON, IT IS ONLY GOING TO BE A DRIVE-THRU, NOT AN  IN-PERSON.
SO I JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY THAT TOO.

20:05:58 SO I THINK THAT THAT'S IT FOR THIS EVENING.
BUT THAT AND ALSO IN LIGHT OF ALL OF 
20:06:05 OUR SERVICES, I WANTED TO JUST TO THANK ALL OF OUR STAFF AND WHETHER IT'S PUBLIC SAFETY OR LAW ENFORCEMENT OR 
20:06:11 ALL OF OUR HUMAN SERVICES, THAT TOGETHER, AGAIN, WE ARE SERVING OUR COMMUNITIES, AND I WANT TO THANK MY 
20:06:17 FELLOW COUNCILMEMBERS AND THE LEADERSHIP TEAM AS WE START THE NEW YEAR WITH NEW TEAMS AND NEW 
20:06:22 GOVERNANCE, AND AGAIN, WELCOME TO OUR NEW CITY ATTORNEY,  RAFAEL, WHO WILL BE JOINING US IN FEBRUARY.

20:06:28 AND WITH THAT NOTE, I'D ASK PEOPLE TO PLEASE HELP US.
THERE WAS A NOTICE ALSO FROM THE 
20:06:35 HOSPITALS THAT IF YOU DO NEED COVID TESTING, WE DO HAVE THAT INFORMATION PUBLISHED ON OUR WEBSITE AND THERE ARE 
20:06:40 A LOT OF PARTNERSHIPS WITH BAY AREA COMMUNITY HEALTH, WITH ASIAN HEALTH, WITH WASHINGTON  HOSPITAL, AND KAISER 
20:06:45 AND OTHER AGENCIES.
BUT AGAIN, THEY'RE ASKING, BECAUSE WE'VE OPINION SEEING SOME RISE OF 
20:06:50 PEOPLE GOING INTO THE HOSPITALS THAT IF YOU'RE NOT SYMPTOMATIC, PLEASE, TO GIVE THEM SOME SPACE BECAUSE WE ARE 
20:06:57 HAVING A LOT OF PEOPLE GOING TO THOSE LOCATIONS.
SO I KNOW IT'S BEEN A CHALLENGE TO GET 
20:07:00 BOTH -- AND I KNOW THIS WEEK WAS A LITTLE BIT OF CHALLENGE TOO FOR TRAFFIC.

20:07:06 I KNOW SOME OF OUR STUDENTS WERE TRYING TO RETURN, SO WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH ALL OF THE AGENCIES ON TRYING TO 
20:07:12 PROVIDE THAT ASSISTANCE.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME THIS EVENING, FOR YOUR CONTINUED SUPPORT, 
20:07:20 AND WITH THE THEME OF BEING KIND TO ONE ANOTHER AND SUPPORT ONE ANOTHER, ESPECIALLY IN THE SPIRIT OF DR. MARTIN 
20:07:24 LUTHER KING.
SO WITH THAT, I'M JUST GOING TO END AND ADJOURN THE MEETING AND HOPE THAT 
20:07:30  WE SEE YOU ALL SOON, EVEN IF IT'S IN ZOOM.
TAKE CARE, BLESSINGS AND HEALTH TO 
20:07:33 ALL.
HAVE A GOOD EVENING.
