19:05:14 >> Ms. Gauthier: OKAY, WE'LL COME BACK TO THAT.

19:05:16 >> Mayor Mei: WHAT ITEM IS THAT?

19:05:19 I'M SORRY, I'M TRYING TO PULL IT UP.

19:05:20 >> Ms. Gauthier: IT'S 2D.

19:05:21 >> Mayor Mei: OKAY.

19:05:27 SEEING NO OTHER, CAN WE GET A MOTION TO MOVE THE -- UNLESS COUNCIL HAS 
19:05:30 ANYTHING THEY WANT TO PULL, OTHERWISE WE CAN MOVE CONSENT CALENDAR.

19:05:31 >> Councilmember Cox: YES, I DO.

19:05:33 I DID WANT TO PULL 2C.

19:05:42 >> Mayor Mei: OKAY.

19:05:48 SO CAN WE GET A MOTION TO MOVE THE CONSENT CALENDAR --

19:05:51 >> Ms. Gauthier: THOSE WERE THE ONLY TWO ITEMS, MADAME MAYOR.

19:05:53 >> Mayor Mei: SO WE CAN'T MOVE THAT.

19:05:54 TWO ITEMS ONLY.

19:06:01 >> Ms. Gauthier: WE'LL MOVE ON TO PUBLIC COMMUNICATIONS, ORAL 
19:06:01 COMMUNICATIONS.

19:06:05 >> Mayor Mei: AND OR COMMUNICATIONS AGAIN, JUST A REMINDER, ARE ITEMS THAT

19:06:19 KELLY, DID YOU WANT TO SPEAK ON ORAL COMMUNICATIONS?

19:06:21 >> YES, I DO.

19:06:22 >> Mayor Mei: OKAY.

19:06:24 PLEASE BEGIN.

19:06:29 >> Ms. Gauthier: I'M SORRY, MADAME MAYOR, WHAT WAS THE TIMING FOR THE 
19:06:30 ORAL COMMUNICATIONS?

19:06:34 >> Mayor Mei: THREE SPEAKERS, SO WE'LL JUST GO WITH 2 MINUTES EACH.

19:06:38 I APOLOGIZE, I'M ON THE EAST COAST RIGHT NOW TOO.

19:06:39 >> Ms. Gauthier: ALL RIGHT.

19:06:41 2 MINUTES PER SPEAKER.

19:06:45 ALL RIGHT, MR. ABREU.

19:06:46 >> Mayor Mei: WELCOME.

19:06:59 >> THERE IS A -- THE CITY COUNCIL NEEDS TO KEEP IN MIND, CAREFUL TRACK OF WHAT 
19:07:00 RESOLUTION IT APPROVES.

19:07:07 AND LUCKILY THE CITY ATTORNEY READS THEM OUT, YOU KNOW, AND SAYS -- GIVES 
19:07:09 YOU WHAT YOU'RE APPROVING.

19:07:13 SO FOR EXAMPLE, I'D LIKE TO JUST REMIND YOU OF ONE OF THE RESOLUTIONS THAT YOU 
19:07:20 DID APPROVE ON APRIL 14TH, 2020, AND IT WAS TITLED "ADOPT A RESOLUTION TO 
19:07:26 RATIFY THE CITY MANAGER'S REQUEST -- PARK DISTRICT TO IMMEDIATELY CLOSE THE 
19:07:31 MISSION PEAK PRESERVE TRAILS, STAGING AREA AND PARKING LOTS THAT ARE 
19:07:32 ACCESSED FROM STANFORD AVENUE."

19:07:35 THAT WAS THE TITLE OF THE RESOLUTION.

19:07:37 DID YOU HEAR ANYTHING ABOUT STREET?

19:07:39 NOT REALLY.

19:07:41 IT JUST TALKS ABOUT THE PARK.

19:07:43 CLOSE THE PARK.

19:07:45 THAT'S WHAT THE RESOLUTION WAS.

19:07:48 THAT'S WHAT YOU WROTE IN YOUR LETTERS, THAT'S WHAT YOU PUT IN THE RESOLUTION, 
19:07:59 THAT'S WHAT YOU APPROVED, AND IT'S VERY DISINGENUOUS, IT'S COUNTER FACTUAL FOR 
19:08:03 THE COUNCIL TO COME BACK LATER AND SAY WE DIDN'T CLOSE THE PARK, WE ONLY 
19:08:03 CLOSED THE STREET.

19:08:04 THANK YOU.

19:08:06 >> Mayor Mei: OKAY.

19:08:15 NEXT FOR PUBLIC COMMENT ITEM, SHARON, WELCOME.

19:08:20 >> Ms. Gauthier: SHARON?

19:08:22 >> HI.

19:08:23 SORRY.

19:08:24 CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW?

19:08:25 >> Mayor Mei: YES.

19:08:26 >> THANK YOU.

19:08:26 GOOD EVENING.

19:08:28 THIS IS SHARON SCHARFF.

19:08:34 FOR THREE YEARS, I'VE BEEN PROVIDING DOCUMENTS, FACTS AND REALTIME 
19:08:38 INFORMATION REGARDING THE ILLEGAL AND DANGEROUS CHANGES MADE TO RANCHO 
19:08:42 ARROYO PARKWAY, A UNIQUE PARKWAY IN THE ISOLATED AND GEE GRAVELLY RESTRICTED 
19:08:42 AREA OF NILES.

19:08:48 I'VE BEEN DISMISSED, IGNORED AND DOWNRIGHT INSULTED WITH THE RIDICULOUS 
19:08:52 JUSTIFICATIONS THE CITY HAS TOSSED OUT THAT ARE VAGUE AND MEANINGLESS AND 
19:08:57 NONRESPONSIVE TO THE  UNAUTHORIZED ACTIONS MADE BY PUBLIC WORKS TO RANCHO 
19:08:58 ARROYO PARKWAY.

19:09:02 THE ATTITUDE, CULTURE AND BEHAVIOR THE CITY HAS ENCOURAGED IN MANAGEMENT 
19:09:06 DEMONSTRATES THERE IS NO RESPONSIBILITY OR ACCOUNTABILITY TO OPERATE IN 
19:09:08 ACCORDANCE TO LEGAL AND MORAL PARAMETERS.

19:09:15 MY STREET IS A MESS, ACCESS IS BAD, AND ILLEGALLY ADDING STREET PARKING HAS 
19:09:18 INCREASED DANGERS FOR WALKERS, BIKERS AND DRIVERS.

19:09:23 IT'S ADDED MORE CARS, POLLUTION AND TRASH TO A ONCE SAFE, QUIET 
19:09:24 ESTABLISHED NEIGHBORHOOD WITH ZERO SAFETY ISSUES.

19:09:28 YET THE CITY SAYS THIS IS SAFER AND BETTER FOR ALL OF FREMONT.

19:09:30 THOSE ARE NOT ANSWERS.

19:09:34 ANSWER THE QUESTION, SHOW ME WHERE THE LAW ALLOWS THIS KIND OF ABUSE OF 
19:09:34 POWER.

19:09:40 I WILL CONTINUE TO BRING THIS TO YOUR ATTENTION AND ASK FOR AN ACTUAL ANSWER 
19:09:44 UNTIL YOU REMOVE THE ABSURD PARKING AND REVERSE SOME OF THE COMPLETELY FLAWED 
19:09:45 AND DANGEROUS DESIGNS.

19:09:51 EVEN IF IT'S ONLY GOING TO DELAY THE RATHER MEANINGLESS MEETINGS FOR THREE 
19:09:55 MINUTES BECAUSE YOU CLEARLY HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT PUBLIC CONCERN OR 
19:09:57 SAFETY IS NOT A FACTOR IN YOUR DECISION-MAKING PROCESS.

19:10:06 IT'S NOT A BAD TRADEOFF BECAUSE I HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE ABOMINABLE AND 
19:10:08 DANGEROUS ACTIONS EVERY SINGLE DAY.

19:10:09 THANK YOU.

19:10:09 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:10:11 NEXT SPEAKER IS BLAIR BEEKMAN.

19:10:18 >> HI.

19:10:19 BLAIR BEEKMAN HERE.

19:10:22 HAPPY MID JANUARY AND HAPPY 2022.

19:10:29 THE IDEAS OF GREEN  SUSTAINABILITY AND RACIAL EQUITY AND LOWER INCOME 
19:10:31 NEIGHBORHOODS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS  INTERESTING WAYS OF THINKING AND 
19:10:32 WORKING.

19:10:37 AND IN THIS TIME OF REMEMBRANCE, DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING'S  SPEECHES 
19:10:40 INTERESTINGLY WOULD OFTEN TRY TO ADDRESS AN INTERCONNECTEDNESS OF THIS 
19:10:43  WORLD, AND THAT WOULD INCLUDE IDEAS OF SUSTAINABILITY AND GOOD ENVIRONMENTAL 
19:10:46 PRACTICES AS HOW TO BETTER ADDRESS THIS WORLD WE ALL SHARE.

19:10:52 AND FROM THIS, IT IS BECOMING MORE CLEAR, I FEEL, HOW THE IMPORTANT 
19:10:59 INFLUENCE OF ACLU SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGY IDEAS CAN HELP WITH IDEAS 
19:11:02 OF  REIMAGINE, RACIAL EQUITY AND COMMUNITY HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES 
19:11:02 IDEAS AT THIS TIME.

19:11:07 AND HOW TO HELP DEFINE MORE OPEN ACCOUNTABLE PRACTICES AND  POLICIES.

19:11:11 AS THIS IS A TIME THAT ALL OF THESE GOOD EFFORTS CAN SIMPLY HELP BETTER 
19:11:23 ORGANIZE OURSELVES AROUND AN OVERWHELMING SET OF NEW LAW 
19:11:28 ENFORCEMENT ASKS THAT ARE TAKING PLACE ALL AROUND THE BAY AREA AT THIS TIME.

19:11:34 TO CONCLUDE AND TO AGAIN OFFER IN THE CURRENT APPROVAL PROCESS OF CONTINUING 
19:11:40 HYBRID PUBLIC MEETINGS FOR LOCAL BAY AREA GOVERNMENTS, I FEEL AT THIS 
19:11:44 PUBLIC COMMENT TIME, THE PUBLIC SHOULD BE ALLOWED THEIR OWN ATTEMPTS AT 
19:11:47 RESPONSIBLE INFORMATION SHARING AND PLANNING IDEAS AROUND COMMUNITY PUBLIC 
19:11:53 HEALTH AND SAFETY ISSUES, IN THIS ONGOING ERA OF A COVID-19 PANDEMIC, 
19:11:54 ITS VARIANTS AND THE VACCINE PROCESS.

19:11:59 I HOPE THIS CAN BE A CONTINUED OPEN THOUGHT AND DISCUSSION ON THIS MATTER, 
19:12:04 AND THAT WITH THE NANOTECHNOLOGY THAT'S INVOLVED IN THE VACCINE PROCESS, I 
19:12:10 HOPE WE CAN OFFER A PROCESS OF OPEN PUBLIC POLICIES FOR ALL SIDES THAT CAN 
19:12:13 TALK ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THESE PRACTICES.

19:12:14 THANK YOU.

19:12:18 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:12:21 AND I BELIEVE THAT WAS OUR LAST PUBLIC SPEAKER.

19:12:23 >> Ms. Gauthier: CORRECT, MAYOR.

19:12:25 
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:12:32 SO AT THIS TIME, WE'LL RETURN TO ITEMS THAT WERE PULLED FROM THE CONSENT 
19:12:32 CALENDAR.

19:12:39 

19:12:40 >> Ms. Gauthier: COUNCILMEMBER COX PULLED ITEM 2C.

19:12:44 >> Councilmember Cox: THANK YOU.

19:12:51 I REALLY APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT SUZANNE SHENFIL AND HER HUMAN SERVICES 
19:12:56 TEAM FOR ENSURING THAT SENIORS, OLDER ADULTS AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES 
19:13:00 HAS TRANSPORTATION SERVICES FOR A BETTER QUALITY OF LIFE.

19:13:06 AND FROM READING THE INFORMATION, I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS TO GET 
19:13:07 CLARIFIED.

19:13:16 NUMBER ONE, I'M CONCERNED ABOUT OUR MOST VULNERABLE RESIDENTS.

19:13:25 IN TERMS OF RIDING INSIDE OF A TRANSPORTATION -- OR A VAN THAT WE'RE 
19:13:32 PROVIDING TRANSPORTATION SERVICES, I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE EXPOSURE TO COVID 
19:13:37 TO OUR RESIDENTS THAT ARE MOST VULNERABLE, AND I WAS WONDERING, YOU 
19:13:41 KNOW, SINCE WE'RE STILL IN THE MIDDLE OF A SURGE AND THINGS ARE SUPPOSED TO 
19:13:46 BE HAPPENING CONTINUOUSLY STARTING EFFECTIVE WHAT'S PROPOSED TONIGHT, 
19:13:55 STARTING ACTUALLY JANUARY VERSUS AN EXTENSION, DOES THE CITY OF FREMONT 
19:13:59 HAVE MANDATORY VACCINATION REQUIREMENTS AND THE CONTRACTS FOR INTERFACING WITH 
19:14:03 OUR RESIDENTS, AND ESPECIALLY THINKING OF THOSE THAT MAY NOT HAVE A VOICE TO 
19:14:10 BE ABLE TO SPEAK AND HOW WE'RE MANAGING THAT TYPE OF EXPOSURE, AND IS THERE 
19:14:15 SOME CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN PUT IN THIS AMENDMENT THAT WE'RE 
19:14:21 APPROVING SINCE I DON'T HAVE THE ACTUAL COPY OF THE AMENDMENT, BUT IS THERE 
19:14:26 SOME DISCUSSION AND WHAT'S BEEN WRITTEN IN THERE TO PROTECT OUR RESIDENTS?

19:14:31 AS THEY GET RIDES TO WHERE THEY NEED TO GO?

19:14:39 >> Ms. Shenfil: COUNCILMEMBER COX, I'M GOING TO LET OUR TRANSIT MANAGER 
19:14:40 ANSWER THAT QUESTION.

19:14:46 I'M NOT SURE THAT WE HAVE ANY LANGUAGE LIKE THAT IN THE PROPOSED CONTRACT, 
19:14:48 BUT IT IS SOMETHING WE COULD CERTAINLY CONSIDER.

19:14:50 SEAN, DO YOU WANT TO RESPOND?

19:14:53 >> SURE.

19:14:55 THANK YOU, COUNCILMEMBER COX, FOR YOUR QUESTIONS.

19:15:00 THESE ARE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT QUESTIONS AS WE'RE TRYING TO DEAL WITH 
19:15:03 THE SAFETY OF OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS, OUR OLDER ADULTS AND FOLKS WITH 
19:15:09 DISABILITIES THAT WE ARE TRANSPORTING MOUNTAIN COMMUNITY.

19:15:18 WITH RESPECT TO SAFETY REQUIREMENTS ON THE VIEKS,  ANYONE WHO IS RIDING ON 
19:15:24 PUBLIC TRANSIT, INCLUDING PARATRANSIT SERVICES, ARE REQUIRED TO BE MASKED 
19:15:25 WHILE ON THOSE VEHICLES.

19:15:31 THAT INCLUDES BOTH THE RIDERS AND THE DRIVERS.

19:15:35 OUR CONTRACTED SERVICE PROVIDER, MB TRANSPORTATION, IS LOOKING INTO 
19:15:45 PROVIDING OR MAYBE HAS ALREADY SECURED KN95 MASKS FOR THE DRIVERS OF THOSE 
19:15:51 VEHICLES TO PROVIDE EXTRA ADDED BARRIERS IN THE VEHICLES, THE VEHICLES 
19:15:57 WHEN THE WEATHER ALLOWS, ET CETERA, WINDOWS ARE KEPT OPEN, THE VEHICLES 
19:16:02 ARE SANITIZED TO GO THROUGH A REGULAR PROCESS FOR SANITIZING.

19:16:08 THERE AREN'T CURRENTLY VACCINE MANDATES.

19:16:14 AS THAT'S CERTAINLY A LARGER CITY POLICY QUESTION THAT I'M SURE THE 
19:16:20 LEADERSHIP TEAM COULD ADDRESS MORE, BUT CERTAINLY IF THE CITY WERE TO 
19:16:24 IMPLEMENT SUCH A POLICY, THAT'S SOMETHING WE WOULD LOOK TO IMPLEMENT 
19:16:25 WITH OUR TRANSPORTATION SERVICES AS WELL.

19:16:30 NOT SURE IF THAT ANSWERS SOME OF THOSE QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE.

19:16:34 HOPEFULLY I CAUGHT THAT BUT IF THERE ARE ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS, I'M MORE 
19:16:35 THAN HAPPY TO ANSWER.

19:16:41 AND I SHOULD JUST MENTION AS WELL THAT WHAT WE'VE SEEN IS DEMAND ON OUR 
19:16:48 TRANSPORTATION SERVICE DIP AS WE'VE HAD SURGES IN THE COMMUNITY, BOTH FROM 
19:16:51 PEOPLE SELF-RESTRICTING THEIR OWN TRAVEL AS WELL AS MEDICAL FACILITIES 
19:17:01 CURTAILING UNNECESSARY KIND OF -- OR LESS ESSENTIAL APPOINTMENTS, I SHOULD 
19:17:04 SAY, AND PEOPLE ARE REALLY  SELF-RESTRICTING QUITE A BIT.

19:17:09 AND PART OF THE IMPETUS FOR  DOING THIS CONTRACT AMENDMENT IS REALLY TRYING TO 
19:17:14 GET A HANDLE ON WHAT IS GOING ON WITH OUR TRANSPORTATION SERVICE DEMAND SO 
19:17:17 THAT WE CAN PLAN BETTER FOR THE FUTURE.

19:17:17 THANK YOU.

19:17:22 >> Councilmember Cox: THANK YOU FOR YOUR RESPONSE.

19:17:31 I STILL -- IT DIDN'T TOTALLY ANSWER THE QUESTION, AND JUST TRYING TO 
19:17:38 UNDERSTAND IN TERMS OF PROTECTING THE RESIDENTS, IT'S GOOD YOU'RE GOING TO 
19:17:48 HAVE THE  KN95 -- I MEAN THE PROVIDER PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION COMPANY PROVIDE 
19:17:54 THE K-9 N95 TO THE DRIVERS, BUT STILL NOT KNOWING THE STATUS AND THERE IS A 
19:17:59 RISK THERE, AND BY US PROVIDING IT, WOULD THAT BE THAT IF SOMEONE 
19:18:06 CONTRACTED IT AND TRACED IT BACK TO THE CITY OF FREMONT, PROVIDING THESE TYPE 
19:18:14 OF  SERVICES, WOULD WE THEN BE  LIABLE, YOU KNOW, AND HAVING TO PAY HOSPITAL 
19:18:22 AND OTHER THINGS IF IT WAS TRACED BACK TO THE CITY OF FREMONT AND THE DRIVER 
19:18:26 WE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THE STATUS -- IF THEY WERE VACCINATED OR THEY HAD THE 
19:18:34 BOOSTER, ARE WE EXPECTING THE EMPLOYERS TO BE ABLE TO VERIFY THAT AND SUBMIT 
19:18:37 SOME SORT OF INFORMATION TO THE CITY OF FREMONT?

19:18:47 >> WHAT I CAN SAY WITH RESPECT TO THINGS LIKE THROUGHOUT THIS ENTIRE 
19:18:53 TIME, WE HAVE BEEN VERY PROACTIVE IN PROVIDING VACCINE CLINIC INFORMATION 
19:18:58 TO OUR TRANSPORTATION SERVICE PROVIDERS AND THEY HAVE BEEN VERY PROACTIVE AND 
19:19:02 ALSO GETTING THAT INFORMATION OUT TO THEIR  DRIVERS.

19:19:10 SO I CAN SAY -- I DON'T HAVE THE INFORMATION AS TO -- BECAUSE WE DON'T 
19:19:18 COLLECT THAT INFORMATION PER OUR CURRENT SERVICE AGREEMENT WITH THOSE 
19:19:25 THAT ARE PROVIDING SERVICES TO OUR RESIDENTS, BUT I'D NOTE  ANECDOTALLY 
19:19:27 THAT MANY OF THE DRIVERS HAVE GOTTEN VACCINATED.

19:19:32 BUT UNTIL WE KIND OF MAKE THAT DECISION AS A POLICY DECISION, YOU KNOW, WE'RE 
19:19:37 MORE THAN HAPPY TO IMPLEMENT THAT, GET INFORMATION, CONTINUE TO GET 
19:19:40 INFORMATION OUT TO THE DRIVERS, TO OUR PASSENGERS.

19:19:48 WE HAD AN EFFORT TO ENSURE THAT ALL RIDERS WHO NEEDED TO GET RIDES TO 
19:19:52 VACCINE APPOINTMENTS WERE GIVEN THOSE RIDES FREE OF CHARGE.

19:19:57 SO WE STILL ARE LOOKING AT, YOU KNOW, TRYING TO PUSH FOR VACCINES AND 
19:20:02 BOOSTERS WITHIN OUR COMMUNITY AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE AND ENSURE THAT THERE'S 
19:20:06 GOOD ACCESS VIA OUR TRANSPORTATION RESOURCES TO DO THAT.

19:20:10 AND ALSO JUST PROVIDING GENERAL INFORMATION OUT TO THE PUBLIC ABOUT 
19:20:15 VACCINES AND BOOSTERS AND ALL THE SAFETY PRECAUTIONS,  MASKING, 
19:20:19 SANITIZING,  VENTILATION, ET CETERA, THAT WE'RE DOING ON OUR VEHICLES.

19:20:19 >> City Mgr. Shackelford: RIGHT.

19:20:22 THANK YOU, SHAWN.

19:20:27 AS COUNCILMEMBER COX SAYS, SHAWN HAS EXPRESSED, THE CITY OF FREMONT, FROM A 
19:20:33 POLICY PERSPECTIVE, HAS NOT YET TAKEN THE STANCE OF REQUIRING VACCINATION 
19:20:36 FOR ALL OF OUR EMPLOYEES AND OUR CONTRACTORS.

19:20:46 THE POSITION THAT WE HAVE TAKEN IS THAT WE'RE FOLLOWING THE LEAD OF OUR 
19:20:53 COUNTY, STATE, AND FEDERAL AUTHORITIES WHERE THAT'S CONCERNED, AND AT THE 
19:20:57 POINT THAT THEY DETERMINE OR IT IS DETERMINED THAT THAT'S A REQUIREMENT 
19:21:02 FOR THE CITY OF FREMONT, WE WILL CERTAINLY IMPLEMENT THAT FOR ALL OF 
19:21:06 OUR STAFF AND ALL OF OUR VENDORS AND CONTRACTORS AND SUCH.

19:21:14 AND/OR, IF WE GET TO A POINT WHERE OUR CITY COUNCIL  DETERMINES THAT THE 
19:21:20 SPREAD OF THE VIRUS IS SUCH THAT, YOU  KNOW, IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO 
19:21:24 AND SHOULD BE REQUIRING, AT THAT POINT WE'LL DO THAT.

19:21:31 SO AS SEAN EXPRESSED, WE'RE NOT REQUIRING THAT OF OUR VENDORS RIGHT 
19:21:31 NOW.

19:21:37 WE DO ASK THE QUESTION OF OUR VENDORS, PARTICULARLY AS WE ENTER INTO NEW 
19:21:43 CONTRACTS AS WELL AS NEW STAFF MEMBERS, BUT IT'S NOT YET A REQUIREMENT OF THE 
19:21:44 CITY OF FREMONT.

19:21:49 >> Councilmember Cox: DO THEY EVEN DO TESTING?

19:21:55 I KNOW THIS IS A CONTINUATION OF A EXISTING CONTRACT THAT'S BEEN EXTENDED.

19:22:02 ARE THEY -- IS THE VENDOR WILLING TO EVEN HAVE THEIR DRIVERS HAVE PCR 
19:22:02 TESTING?

19:22:07 HAVE YOU DISCUSSED THAT AT ALL?

19:22:13 >> THERE ARE NO TESTING REQUIREMENTS AT THIS POINT.

19:22:23 CERTAINLY THE VENDOR HAS  PROVIDED TESTING RESOURCES TO ITS PERSONNEL, 
19:22:27 AND WE HAVE PROVIDED TO THE VENDOR INFORMATION ABOUT LOCAL TESTING AND 
19:22:30 VACCINE RESOURCES WITHIN OUR COMMUNITY.

19:22:36 >> Councilmember Cox: HAVE THEY EVER SHUT DOWN DUE TO COVID AT ALL?

19:22:38 >> NO.

19:22:39 >> Councilmember Cox: AT THIS TIME?

19:22:40 >> NO.

19:22:42 >> Councilmember Cox: THEY'VE MAINTAINED THE SAME SERVICE LEVEL?

19:22:48 >> WE HAVE HAD TO ADJUST SERVICE LEVELS PARTLY FROM THE DEMAND OF OUR PROGRAM 
19:22:55 PARTICIPANTS BEING EXTRA CAUTIOUS IN GOING OUT INTO THE COMMUNITY, SO WE'VE 
19:22:58 HAD TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF VEHICLES THAT WE HAVE IN SERVICE.

19:23:07 BUT THERE HAS NOT BEEN ANY ISSUE WITH DRIVER SHORTAGES OR COVID OUTBREAKS 
19:23:12 THAT HAS IMPACTED OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE ESSENTIAL TRANSPORTATION.

19:23:17 WE HAVE EVEN IN THE MIDST OF THIS CURRENT SURGE, WE HAVE CRITICAL 
19:23:21 TRANSPORTATION THAT WE'RE PROVIDING TO INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE GOING TO REGULAR 
19:23:24 DIALYSIS TREATMENT,  CHEMOTHERAPY, INFUSIONS, ET CETERA.

19:23:29 AND DOING SO IN A VERY SAFE MANNER.

19:23:30 >> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.

19:23:37 SO YOU'VE HAD HOSPITAL -- TAKING SOME OF OUR RESIDENTS TO SOME OF THE 
19:23:42 MEDICAL APPOINTMENTS AND EVEN FOR ALL WHAT YOU JUST SAID, SO THIS IS ALL 
19:23:44 PART OF THAT AS WELL?

19:23:48 >> YEAH, WE HAVE BEEN, FROM THE VERY GET-GO, WHEN THE SHUTDOWN HAPPENED IN 
19:23:55 MARCH OF 2020, WE HAD BEEN PROVIDING AND WILL CONTINUE TO PROVIDE CRITICAL 
19:23:57 TRANSPORTATION SERVICES TO OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS.

19:24:04 SO EVEN IN THE MIDST OF A COVID SURGE, WE ARE PROVIDING THOSE CRITICAL 
19:24:05 TRANSPORTATION  SERVICES.

19:24:06 >> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.

19:24:07 GOT IT.

19:24:08 OKAY.

19:24:12 WELL, I KNOW IT'S NOT A CITY POLICY, BUT MAYBE IT'S SOMETHING TO PUT ON THE 
19:24:21 BACK BURNER OF HOW TO MANAGE THIS AND HOW TO SEE IF THERE'S OTHER WAYS OF 
19:24:28  CONNECTING, AND EVEN A LINK OF WHAT'S WITH THE STATE OR THE ALAMEDA COUNTY, 
19:24:33 CALLS OUT CAN ALWAYS BE REFERENCED IN A CONTRACT TOO AS KIND OF THE LATEST OF 
19:24:36 WHATEVER THE HEALTH ORDER IS AT THAT TIME.

19:24:40 >> City Mgr. Shackelford: THANK YOU.

19:24:45 WE CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE LINE OF QUESTIONING AND THAT'S CERTAINLY 
19:24:51 SOMETHING THAT WE CAN INCORPORATE MOVING FORWARD AS WE AMEND CONTRACTS 
19:24:57 OR ENTER INTO NEW CONTRACTS, EVEN THOUGH IT'S NOT, AS YOU JUST STATED, A 
19:25:02 CURRENT CITY POLICY, WE CAN, YOU KNOW, AT A MINIMUM HAVE THE INFORMATION AS 
19:25:09 TO WHAT OUR CONTRACTORS, VENDORS AND CONSULTANTS ARE DOING IN THE WAY OF 
19:25:11 COVID SAFETY PROTOCOL.

19:25:12 SO THANK YOU FOR THAT.

19:25:14 >> Councilmember Cox: YOU'RE WELCOME.

19:25:21 AND THEN YOU ALSO, SHAWN, HAD ADDRESSED ABOUT -- I WAS ASKING ALSO BECAUSE A 
19:25:24 LOT OF DRIVERS, THERE IS LABOR SHORTAGES AROUND THAT AND YOU 
19:25:31 ADDRESSED THAT THERE HASN'T BEEN ANY CHANGE IN SERVICES, WHICH IS A GOOD 
19:25:36 FIND, WE'RE KEEPING OUR FINGERS CROSSED, OF COURSE, BUT THIS IS A VERY 
19:25:39 CRITICAL SERVICE AND I DON'T WANT TO BE IN THE WAY OF ANY OF THAT, KEEPING IT 
19:25:42 FROM THE RESIDENTS THAT SO DESERVE THIS TYPE OF SERVICES.

19:25:47 THE OTHER QUESTION, I WAS JUST WONDERING, IT SEEMED LIKE A VERY 
19:25:50 AGGRESSIVE SCHEDULE IN GOING OUT TO AWARD THE CONTRACT.

19:25:58 I MEAN, TO GET A NEW COMPETITIVE BID GOING OUT, YOU KNOW, GOING THROUGH THE 
19:26:01 EVALUATION AND MAKING THE AWARD AND NEGOTIATIONS.

19:26:05 IT SEEMS LIKE A VERY AGGRESSIVE SCHEDULE TO BE ABLE TO COMPLETE BY 
19:26:12 JUNE 30TH, AND WHAT'S THE BACKUP IF THAT -- YOU KNOW, BECAUSE THINGS ARE 
19:26:17 CHANGING AND MOVING, AND IF YOU WANT TO SHARE A LITTLE BIT OF WHAT IS KIND OF 
19:26:20 THE BACKUP PLAN THERE.

19:26:28 >> WELL, WE MAY BE BACK BEFORE THE COUNCIL AGAIN, BUT THE HOPE IS WE'VE 
19:26:35 NOW HAD TWO YEARS OF THE PANDEMIC UNFORTUNATELY, BUT HAVING A MUCH 
19:26:40 BETTER SENSE OF WHAT THE DEMAND IS LOOKING LIKE AND BEING ABLE TO BETTER 
19:26:43 PROJECT DEMAND, ESPECIALLY AS WE MOVE THROUGH SURGES.

19:26:52 SO WE ARE ACTUALLY COORDINATING WITH UNION CITY PARATRANSIT TO DO -- TO 
19:26:57 ESSENTIALLY SORT OF POTENTIALLY PIGGY BACK ON THEIR BID FOR SERVICE.

19:27:03 SO WE HAVE THINGS IN THE WORKS AND KIND OF READY TO GO.

19:27:08 IT JUST A MATTER OF KIND OF REALLY FIGURING OUT WITH THE CURRENT SURGE 
19:27:17 AND THE DATA THAT WE HAVE, MAKING SURE THE TIMING FITS FOR US AS WE LOOK LONG 
19:27:18 TERM FOR THE NEXT THREE TO FIVE  YEARS.

19:27:20 >> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.

19:27:26 AND I DO LIKE THE IDEA OF PIGGY BACKING, SO IT'S NOT HAVING TO START 
19:27:26 FROM SCRATCH.

19:27:29 SO THAT HELPS TO EXPEDITE THAT.

19:27:35 SO I APPRECIATE, I KNOW I JUST HAD TO FIND OUT A LITTLE BIT MORE THERE IN 
19:27:40 THOSE PARTICULAR AREAS AND I APPRECIATE YOUR WHOLE TEAM, ALL OF YOU, AND 
19:27:41 PROVIDING SUCH A CRITICAL SERVICE.

19:27:43 SO THAT TAKES CARE OF ALL MY QUESTIONS.

19:27:44 THANK YOU.

19:27:47 AND I'M READY TO MOVE FORWARD WITH A MOTION ON THIS ONE.

19:27:49 >> Mayor Mei: BEFORE YOU DO THAT, I SEE ANOTHER HAND RAISED.

19:27:55 SO KELLY, WERE YOU TRYING TO ADDRESS THIS ITEM ALSO?

19:27:58 >> NO, I'M ADDRESSING THE CITY NEWSLETTER ITEM.

19:27:58 SORRY.

19:27:59 >> Mayor Mei: OKAY, GREAT.

19:28:01 >> Ms. Gauthier: WE'LL COME BACK TO YOU ON THAT.

19:28:01 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:28:04 I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE AND CLARIFY THAT.

19:28:06 AND SO CAN I GET A MOTION?

19:28:09 I SEE A MOTION BY COUNCILMEMBER COX AND SECOND BY COUNCILMEMBER SHAO.

19:28:14 I ALSO WANTED TO JUST THANK THE TEAM AND THE SERVICE PROVIDERS.

19:28:20 IT HAS BEEN CRITICAL FOR US TO ENSURE THAT OUR CONTINUED EFFORTS IN TERMS OF 
19:28:26 PROVIDING ACCESSIBILITY, SO SHAWN, I WANTED TO THANK YOU AND THE TEAM WHO 
19:28:27 HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO THIS.

19:28:31 I KNOW WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH SO MANY IN THIS TIME, AND THE MORE WE CAN DO 
19:28:35 TO HELP KEEP EVERYONE HEALTHY, OF COURSE I HAVE FULL FAITH IN OUR TEAM 
19:28:36 IN WORKING ON THAT AREA.

19:28:40 SO MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER COX AND SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER SHAO.

19:28:41 ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE.

19:28:45 >> Ms. Gauthier: COUNCILMEMBER COX, AYE.

19:28:47 COUNCILMEMBER SHAO, AYE.

19:28:49 COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, AYE.

19:28:52 COUNCILMEMBER JONES, AYE.

19:28:54 COUNCILMEMBER KENG, AYE.

19:28:56 VICE MAYOR SALWAN, AYE.

19:28:59 MAYOR MEI, AYE.

19:29:01 >> Mayor Mei: AND SO ITEM 2C PASSES UNANIMOUSLY.

19:29:08 NEXT IS ITEM 2D, AND I BELIEVE KELLY, YOU WERE HOPING TO ADDRESS THAT.

19:29:09 >> YEAH.

19:29:15 SO THE CITY NEWSLETTERS GO OUT AND THEY'RE VERY COLORFUL, BUT I'LL REFER 
19:29:22 YOU BACK TO SOME OF THE COMMUNICATIONS AND COMMITMENTS AND PROMISES MADE IN 
19:29:24 THE SUMMER 2021 NEWSLETTER.

19:29:28 THERE WAS A COMMITMENT TO EXCELLENCE, ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY, AND 
19:29:35 THERE WAS A CLAIM THAT THE CITY IS MAKING -- THAT DESPITE THE PANDEMIC, 
19:29:41 MAJOR PROJECTS CONTINUING AND CLOSE TO COMPLETION, AND IN FACT AT THAT TIME, 
19:29:46 THE DOWNTOWN EVENT CENTER WAS SCHEDULED TO BE COMPLETED AND ON TRACK TO OPEN 
19:29:49 LATER IN THE SUMMER, AND THAT DID HAPPEN, I HEARD, PLUS I HEARD IT LOOKS 
19:29:52 LIKE A PRETTY BUILDING AND IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S OPEN.

19:29:59 AND ALSO CONSTRUCTION OF THE WARM SPRINGS BART BRIDGE, ALMOST COMPLETE 
19:30:04 WITH A VIRTUAL RIBBON CUTTING AND PUBLIC OPENING SCHEDULED FOR THIS 
19:30:04 SUMMER.

19:30:08 AND THIS SUMMER ENDED LAST SEPTEMBER, BY THE WAY.

19:30:18 SO YOU KNOW, THESE KIND OF COMMITMENTS THAT ARE MADE IN THESE NEWT LETTERS, I 
19:30:25  NEWSLETTERS, I THINK THEY SHOULD BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY.

19:30:29 THIS WAS A $40 MILLION BRIDGE, IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE WORKING LAST SEPTEMBER, 
19:30:34 AND WHEN IT DOESN'T WORK, WE SHOULD BE -- WE SHOULD KNOW WHY, AND WE SHOULD 
19:30:43 KNOW WHAT IS THIS PROJECT STATUS, WHAT IS HOLDING IT UP.

19:30:44 MAYBE IT'S NOT EVEN THE CITY.

19:30:47 MAYBE IT COULD BE THERE'S OTHER AGENCIES INVOLVED HERE.

19:30:51 BUT WHAT'S GOING ON THERE, I'M SURE THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES 
19:30:56 OF THAT BRIDGE THAT WANT TO WALK BACK AND FORTH 24 HOURS A DAY, OR RIDE 
19:30:59 BICYCLES OR WHATEVER THEY DO ON THAT BRIDGE AND GET BACK AND FORTH.

19:31:00 THANK YOU.

19:31:03 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:31:09 I WILL NOTE REAL QUICKLY THAT IT WAS UPDATED AT ONE OF OUR MEETINGS WHERE 
19:31:20 WE DID SHARE -- AND I CAN ASK STAFF TO PUT IT ON A NEWSLETTER BUT -- I DON'T 
19:31:24 SEE HANS ONLINE BUT THERE WAS AN UPDATE REGARDING THAT.

19:31:25 KARENA?

19:31:29 >> City Mgr. Shackelford: THIS ISN'T AN AGENDIZED ITEM SO I WOULD PREFER TO 
19:31:36 NOT ADDRESS IT, BUT I'D LIKE TO REFER MR. ABREU AND ANYONE ELSE WHO MAY BE 
19:31:42 INTERESTED IN THE ITEM TO OUR WEBSITE, WHICH IS CONTINUALLY UPDATED AND HAS 
19:31:42 INFORMATION ABOUT THIS ITEM.

19:31:48 

19:31:48 >> Councilmember Jones: MADAME MAYOR?

19:31:52 I'M READY TO MAKE A MOTION TO APPROVE THE CONTRACT FOR THE PRINTING OF THE 
19:31:52 NEWSLETTER.

19:31:54 >> Councilmember Shao: I SECOND.

19:31:58 >> Mayor Mei: MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER JONES AND SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER 
19:31:59 SHAO.

19:32:01 ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE.

19:32:12 >> Ms. Gauthier: COUNCILMEMBER COX, AYE.

19:32:14 COUNCILMEMBER SHAO, AYE.

19:32:16 COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, AYE.

19:32:19 COUNCILMEMBER JONES, AYE.

19:32:21 COUNCILMEMBER KENG, AYE.

19:32:23 VICE MAYOR SALWAN, AYE.

19:32:26 MAYOR MEI, AYE.

19:32:28 >> Mayor Mei: THIS ITEM PASS THE UNANIMOUSLY.

19:32:38 AND SO NEXT ON OUR AGENDA THIS EVENING IS OUR REGULARLY SCHEDULED ITEM, AND 
19:32:40 THERE WILL BE A PRESENTATION.

19:32:47 WHICH IS THE APPLICATION 7A, APPLICATION FOR STATE HOMEKEY ROUND 2 
19:32:47 FUNDING.

19:32:54 AND THERE WILL BE COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT DIRECTOR DAN SCHOENHOLZ AND HUMAN 
19:32:57 SERVICES DIRECTOR SUZANNE SHENFIL WILL BE SHARING THE PRESENTATION ON THIS 
19:32:58 ITEM.

19:33:17 >> Ms. Shenfil: GOOD EVENING, MAYOR AND COUNCILMEMBERS.

19:33:21 COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT DIRECTOR DAN SCHOENHOLZ AND I WILL BE SHARING THIS 
19:33:24 PRESENTATION THIS EVENING ON THE APPLICATION FOR HOMEKEY FUNDING.

19:33:28 I ALSO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THREE ADDITIONAL PANELISTS WHO ARE HERE THIS 
19:33:35 EVENING TO RESPOND DIRECTLY TO QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE ABOUT THE 
19:33:36 PROJECT.

19:33:40 ONE IS DAN LOPEZ WHO IS AN AFFORDABLE HOUSING FINANCIAL CONSULTANT WHO'S 
19:33:41 BEEN WORKING WITH US ON THIS PROJECT.

19:33:49 WE ALSO HAVE ANDY MEYERS, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF SHANGRI-LA 
19:33:57 INDUSTRIES, AND T.O.D. LIPKA, PRESIDENT AND CEO OF THEIR PARTNER ORGANIZATION, 
19:33:57 STEP UP.

19:34:10 HOMELESSNESS IS A HUGE PROBLEM FOR CALIFORNIA, WHICH CURRENTLY HAS 28% OF 
19:34:16 THE NATION'S HOMELESS POPULATION, 160,000-PLUS INDIVIDUALS WITHOUT ROOFS 
19:34:17 OVER THEIR HEADS.

19:34:22 IT ALSO HAS THE HIGHEST RATE OF UNSHELTERED RESIDENTS, 70% OF THAT 
19:34:29 POPULATION HAS NO SHELTER, AND IN 2020, THE STATE ALSO HAD THE GREATEST 
19:34:34 INCREASE IN  HOMELESSNESS AT 6.8%.

19:34:40 HOMELESSNESS AS WE ALL KNOW IS ALSO A GROWING PROBLEM FOR FREMONT, AND IT 
19:34:43 HAS BEEN A TOP PRIORITY FOR THE COUNCIL FOR SEVERAL YEARS.

19:34:52 AS WE ALL KNOW, ONE OF THE MAJOR FACTORS ACCOUNTING FOR  HOMELESSNESS 
19:34:54 IS THE SHORTAGE OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING.

19:35:02 HOMEKEY TRULY OFFERS US AN UNPRECEDENTED OPPORTUNITY TO SECURE A 
19:35:07 SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF STATE FUNDING, NOT ONLY TO PROVIDE PERM NABT 
19:35:13  PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING FOR THE CHRONICALLY  HOMELESS, BUT ALSO TO DO 
19:35:14 IT WITHIN A YEAR'S TIME.

19:35:19 THE PROJECT WE PROPOSE THIS EVENING ALSO ALIGNS WITH THE ALAMEDA COUNTY 
19:35:20 HOME TOGETHER PLAN.

19:35:27 THIS IS THE COUNTY'S IMPLEMENTATION PLAN TO END HOMELESSNESS BY 2026, 
19:35:32 WHICH WILL SERVE AS A BLUEPRINT FOR FUTURE FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES FROM BOTH 
19:35:34 THE STATE AND THE COUNTY.

19:35:40 STAFF IS REQUESTING AUTHORITY TO APPLY FOR APPROXIMATELY $40 MILLION IN 
19:35:47 HOMEKEY FUNDS TO CONVERT MOTEL 6 ON RESEARCH AVENUE TO PERMANENT 
19:35:48 AFFORDABLE SUPPORTIVE HOUSING.

19:36:02 IN 2019, THE HOMELESS COUNT IN FREMONT WAS 608 PERSONS, WHICH WAS A 27% 
19:36:07 INCREASE WHEN COMPARED TO 2017.

19:36:15 OF THOSE COUNTED IN 2019, 485 WERE UNSHELTERED, MEANING THAT THEY RESIDED 
19:36:21 IN A PLACE NOT MEANT FOR HUMAN HABITATION, LIKE VEHICLES OR TENTS 
19:36:21 OUTSIDE.

19:36:27 THIS WAS A 72% INCREASE WHEN WE COMPARED THAT TO 2017.

19:36:35 THE NEXT HOMELESS COUNT WILL NOW TAKE PLACE ON FEBRUARY 23RD.

19:36:41 IT BEEN PUSHED OUT ONE MONTH DUE TO THE NEW COVID VARIANT THAT WE ARE 
19:36:42 CURRENTLY CONFRONTED WITH.

19:36:48 AND WE BELIEVE THAT THE 2022 COUNT WILL SHOW A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE 
19:36:51 UNHOUSED POPULATION IN OUR CITY.

19:36:56 MUCH OF THIS DUAL TO THE IMPACTS OF COVID ON EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES.

19:37:11 WHILE THE CITY HAS MADE A SIGNIFICANT EFFORT TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF 
19:37:15 AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS IN FREMONT, MANY OF THE CITY'S INITIATIVES RELATED 
19:37:20 TO HOMELESSNESS HAVE BEEN DESIGNED TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE OF 
19:37:24 UNHOUSED RESIDENTS WHILE THEY SEARCH FOR MORE PERMANENT HOUSING SOLUTIONS.

19:37:32 THE WINTER SHELTER PROGRAM HELPS PROTECT FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN, 
19:37:40 SENIORS, AND THOSE WITH HEALTH COMPROMISED SITUATIONS BY  BRINGING 
19:37:42 THEM IN FROM COLD AND WET WEATHER.

19:37:48 OUR HYGIENE UNIT OFFERS  SHOWERING AND LAUNDRY OPPORTUNITIES AND OTHER 
19:37:54 SANITARY SERVICES WHICH WE'VE DEPLOYED THROUGHOUT THE CITY HAVE HELPED TO 
19:37:56 STEM THE TIDE OF COVID CASES.

19:38:02 THE ISLANDER MOTEL PROJECT AND THE HOUSING NAVIGATION CENTER BOTH ARE 
19:38:06 TRANSITIONAL SHELTERS WITH SERVICE OPPORTUNITIES.

19:38:10 THEY HAVE ALLOWED THE HOMELESS TO STABILIZE THEIR LIVES IN MANY WAYS, 
19:38:17 INCLUDING IMPROVING THEIR HEALTH, MENTAL HEALTH, TO OBTAIN BENEFITS AND 
19:38:18 EVEN FIND STABLE EMPLOYMENT.

19:38:25 BUT THE ULTIMATE NEED FOR HUNDREDS OF UNHOUSED RESIDENTS IS THE AVAILABILITY 
19:38:27 OF PERMANENT AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING.

19:38:35 SOME PORTION OF OUR HOMELESS POPULATION WILL ALSO CONTINUE TO NEED SUPPORTIVE 
19:38:39 SERVICES IN ORDER TO REMAIN SUCCESSFULLY HOUSED.

19:38:43 DAN?

19:38:46 >> Mr. Schoenholz: THANK YOU, SUZANNE.

19:38:51 AS COUNCIL IS AWARE, EVERY EIGHT YEARS THE CITY IS REQUIRED TO UPDATE THE 
19:38:55 HOUSING ELEMENT OF THE GENERAL PLAN TO REFLECT OUR ASSIGNED SHARE OF THE 
19:38:56 REGION'S HOUSING NEED.

19:39:01 WE'RE IN THE LAST YEAR OF THE CURRENT HOUSING ELEMENT CYCLE, AND AS THE 
19:39:05 SLIDE SHOWS, THE CITY'S TARGET FOR EXTREMELY LOW INCOME AND VERY LOW 
19:39:10 INCOME UNITS IS 1714 UNITS.

19:39:18 AND THROUGH 2021, WE'VE ONLY SEEN 586 SUCH UNITS PRODUCED OR ABOUT 34% OF 
19:39:20 OUR TARGET.

19:39:26 THESE ARE THE UNITS THAT ARE MOST LIKELY TO SERVE THOSE AT RISK OF 
19:39:26 HOMELESSNESS.

19:39:29 IT'S VERY CHALLENGING TO GET THESE EXTREMELY LOW INCOME UNITS BUILT.

19:39:36 THEY'RE EXPENSIVE AND TIME-CONSUMING TO CONSTRUCT, AND TENANTS TYPICALLY NEED 
19:39:39 SUPPORTIVE SERVICES TO STAY HOUSED, WHICH ADDS TO THE COST.

19:39:45 THE HOMEKEY PROGRAM ADDRESSES THESE BARRIERS BY SUPPORTING COST-EFFECTIVE 
19:39:48 QUICK TURNAROUND MOTEL ACQUISITIONS THAT INCLUDE SUPPORTIVE SERVICES.

19:40:01 A BIT OF BACKGROUND REGARDING PROJECT HOMEKEY.

19:40:07 AT THE ONSET OF THE PANDEMIC, THE STATE ESTABLISHED PROJECT ROOMKEY, AND HOTEL 
19:40:12 AND MOTEL ROOMS WERE QUICKLY SECURED FOR VULNERABLE HOMELESS PERSONS AS A 
19:40:15 WAY TO CREATE NON-CONGREGATE SHELTER OPTIONS FOR PEOPLE NEEDING TO 
19:40:19 QUARANTINE OR RECUPERATE FROM COVID AND  HELPING TO MINIMIZE THE STRAIN ON 
19:40:20 HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS.

19:40:28 BUILDING ON THE SUCCESS OF  ROOMKEY, IN JUNE OF 2020, THE GOVERNOR ANNOUNCED 
19:40:33 PROJECT HOMEKEY, THE NEXT PHASE OF THE COVID-19 RESPONSE TO PROTECT HOMELESS 
19:40:35 CALIFORNIANS.

19:40:40 HOMEKEY ROUND 1 WENT A STEP FURTHER BY CREATING INTERIM AND PERMANENT HOUSING 
19:40:45 FOR THE CHRONICALLY HOMELESS THROUGH MOTEL AND HOTEL CONVERSIONS, AS WELL 
19:40:48 AS OTHER APPROACHES LIKE TINY HOME DEVELOPMENT.

19:40:50  DEVELOPMENTS.

19:40:56 HOMEKEY ALSO PROVED EXTREMELY SUCCESSFUL, CREATING 6,000 HOUSING 
19:40:58 UNITS QUICKLY AND COST EFFECTIVELY.

19:41:04 BASED ON THESE POSITIVE RESULTS, THE STATE COMMITTED ANOTHER $2.75 BILLION 
19:41:07 OVER TWO YEARS TO EXPAND PROJECT HOMEKEY.

19:41:14 THE FIRST INSTALLMENT OF FUNDS, 1.45 BILLION FOR HOMEKEY ROUND 2, WAS MADE 
19:41:15 AVAILABLE THIS LAST SEPTEMBER.

19:41:21 AS WITH ROUND ONE, HOTEL AND MOTEL ACQUISITION PROJECTS ARE ONE OF THE 
19:41:26 MAIN STRATEGIES FOR RAPID COST-EFFECTIVE CREATION OF AFFORDABLE 
19:41:27 HOUSING.

19:41:35 TO INCENTIVIZE PROMPT ACTION, THE STATE IS OFFERING A $10,000 PER DOOR FUNDING 
19:41:39 BONUS FOR APPLICATIONS RECEIVED BY JANUARY 31ST, 2022.

19:41:49 I WOULD NOTE THAT THE PROJECT STAFF IS RECOMMENDING TONIGHT THIS BONUS WOULD 
19:41:53 ADD $1.5 MILLION IN ADDED FUNDING FOR THE PROJECT.

19:41:59 WHEN HOMEKEY ROUND 2 WAS  INCLUDED IN THE STATE BUDGET, CITY STAFF DEVELOPED 
19:42:06 AND ISSUED A REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS OR EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST IN DOING A 
19:42:06 HOMEKEY PROJECT IN FREMONT.

19:42:11 WE RECEIVED NUMEROUS EXPRESSIONS OF INTEREST BUT ONLY ONE PROPOSAL THAT 
19:42:17 IDENTIFIED FOUR SPECIFIC HOTEL PROPERTIES THAT COULD BE ACQUIRED AND 
19:42:26 CONVERTED INTO PERMANENT HOUSING FOR THE CHRONICALLY HOMELESS.

19:42:36 THE NEXT FEW SLIDES WILL PROVIDE MORE DETAIL ON THE SHANGRI-LA STEP UP TEAM.

19:42:42 SHANGRI-LA AND STEP UP ARE BASED IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA, ALTHOUGH THEY ARE 
19:42:45 EXPANDING THEIR OPERATIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE.

19:42:50 THEY'VE PREVIOUSLY TEAMED TO DEVELOP 12 PROPERTIES FOCUSED ON EXTREMELY LOW 
19:42:53 INCOME  POPULATIONS.

19:42:59 THE STATE ADMISSION OF THE SHANGRI-LA STEP UP PARTNERSHIP IS TO BE AT THE 
19:43:02 FOREFRONT OF DELIVERING SAFE HOUSING SOLUTIONS COUPLED WITH COMPASSIONATE 
19:43:07 SUPPORT TO HELP THE MOST AT RISK RECOVER, STABILIZE AND INTEGRATE INTO 
19:43:08 THEIR COMMUNITIES.

19:43:14 THE SHANGRI-LA AND STEP UP TEAM PARTICIPATED IN HOMEKEY ROUND ONE ON 
19:43:19 TWO PROJECTS, ONE IN SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY AND ONE IN SALINAS.

19:43:25 CONSTRUCTION AND RENOVATION ON BOTH PROJECTS WAS COMPLETED WITHIN 12 
19:43:25 MONTHS.

19:43:32 THIS SLIDE SHOWS THE STRUCTURE OF THE SHANGRI-LA STEP-UP TEAM.

19:43:36 SHANGRI-LA INDUSTRIES WILL BE THE SITE OWNER AND MASTER DEVELOPER.

19:43:42 THEY HAVE AN IN-HOUSE  DEVELOPMENT TEAM THAT WILL FINANCE AND OVERSEE 
19:43:42 ACQUISITION AND DESIGN.

19:43:47 THEY HAVE A SEPARATE CONSTRUCTION SUBSIDIARY THAT WILL SERVE AS THE 
19:43:49 GENERAL CONTRACTOR FOR THE REHABILITATION OF THE HOTEL.

19:43:55 ONCE CONSTRUCTION IS COMPLETE, STEP UP WILL SERVE AS BOTH THE PROPERTY 
19:43:58 MANAGER AND THE SERVICE PROVIDER.

19:44:06 >> Ms. Shenfil: SO IN DOING SOME DUE DILIGENCE, ON JANUARY 10TH, CITY STAFF 
19:44:13 TALKED WITH TOM HERNANDEZ, DIRECTOR OF THE COUNTY OF SAN BERNARDINO HOUSING 
19:44:15 DEPARTMENT.

19:44:21 SAN BERNARDINO ENTERED INTO A ROUND ONE HOMEKEY PROJECT FOR A HOTEL CONVERSION 
19:44:26 PROPERTY ORIGINALLY FOR 76 UNITS, BUT BECAUSE THE HOTEL HAD A LOT OF SQUARE 
19:44:31 FOOTAGE DESIGNATED TO COMMUNITY SPACE, THEY WERE ABLE TO CREATE FOUR MORE 
19:44:37 UNITS AND STILL MAINTAIN ENOUGH SPACE FOR STEP UP TO PROVIDE SERVICE 
19:44:37 DELIVERY.

19:44:43 THE PROJECT IS ALMOST COMPLETED AND 50 UNITS ARE OCCUPIED.

19:44:48 THE TARGET POPULATION FOR THIS PARTICULAR HOTEL IS FOR HOMELESS 
19:44:51 PERSONS 55 YEARS AND OLDER.

19:44:56 SHANGRI-LA HAVE THEIR OWN ARCHITECT, WHO MR. HERNANDEZ SAID DID A VERY NICE 
19:45:01 JOB OF BLENDING THE RENOVATED BUILDING IN WITH THE ARCHITECTURE OF THE 
19:45:03 SURROUNDING BUILDINGS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

19:45:09 THE OLD HOTEL, HE SAID, WAS AN EYESORE, AND NOT WELL MAINTAINED AND THE 
19:45:12 RENOVATED HOTEL IS REALLY AN ASSET TO THE AREA.

19:45:19 STEP UP IS PROVIDING THE PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AND SUPPORTIVE SERVICES AND 
19:45:25 THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO ALSO WORK TO SECURE HOUSING CHOICE VOUCHERS AND 
19:45:32 VETERANS VASH VOUCHERS AS A WAY TO SUSTAIN THE PROJECT OVER  TIME.

19:45:37 MR. HERNANDEZ STATED THERE HAVE BEEN NO CONCERNS EXPRESSED ABOUT THE HOTEL 
19:45:43 RENOVATIONS FROM LOCAL RESIDENTS IN THE AREA, AND NO PROBLEMS RELATED TO 
19:45:47 SECURITY, ATTRACTION OF HOMELESS OUTSIDE OF THE HOTEL, ET CETERA.

19:45:55 UNITS WERE MODIFIED TO ADD SMALL KITCHENETTES INCLUDING A BURNER, 
19:45:58 MICROWAVE AND SMALL  REFRIGERATOR.

19:46:03 MR. HERNANDEZ SAID SHANGRI-LA WAS A VERY GOOD COMPANY TO WORK WITH AND HE 
19:46:12 INDICATED THAT THE CITY OF REDLIN IS ALSO WORKING WITH SHANGRI-LA AND IS 
19:46:14 VERY HAPPY WITH THE PROJECT TO DATE.

19:46:22 SAN BERNARDINO IS LOOKING FORWARD TO MOVING FORWARD WITH TWO MORE HOTEL 
19:46:22 PROJECTS.

19:46:28 STEP UP ON SECOND STREET WAS ESTABLISHED 35 YEARS AGO AS A DROP-IN 
19:46:34 CENTER OFFERING A SAFE SPACE FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO NEEDED A COMPASSIONATE 
19:46:40 ENVIRONMENT WITH RECOVERY ORIENTED ACTIVITY SUCH AS ART THERAPY, 
19:46:42 EMPLOYMENT TRAINING, COPING SKILLS AND SERVICE COORDINATION.

19:46:47 STAFF AT THAT TIME OBSERVED THAT MANY OF THEIR MEMBERS WERE UNHOUSED, WHICH 
19:46:52 COMPLICATED AND EXACERBATED THEIR EXISTING NEEDS.

19:46:58 SO IN 1994, STEP UP, ALONG WITH A DEVELOPMENT PARTNER, BUILTITY FIRST 
19:47:00 UNITS OF PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING.

19:47:04 AT STEP UP ON SECOND STREET.

19:47:10 TODAY, STEP UP PROVIDES SUPPORTIVE SERVICES FOR 21 PROPERTIES.

19:47:15 IN A RECENT VISIT TO THEIR SAN BERNARDINO SITE, WHICH YOU SAW ON THE 
19:47:23 EARLIER SLIDE, GOVERNOR NEWSOM SAID, SHANGRI-LA AND STEP UP GAVE SOME OF 
19:47:32 THE MOST VULNERABLE CALIFORNIANS THE DIGNITY OF A KEY, A LOCK, A DOOR AND A 
19:47:33 PLACE TO CALL HOME.

19:47:40 STEP UP UTILIZES EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICES OF HARM REDUCTION, 
19:47:40 TRAUMA-INFORMED CARE.

19:47:43 THEY MAINTAIN A STAFFING RATIO OF 1 TO 25.

19:47:48 AND THEY HAVE A 97% RETENTION RATE AFTER ONE YEAR.

19:47:55 SO HOW WILL TENANTS BE SELECTED FOR THE PROJECT?

19:47:59 WELL, MUCH LIKE OUR NAVIGATION CENTER, TENANTS WILL BE REFERRED THROUGH THE 
19:48:05  COUNTY'S COORDINATED ENTRY SYSTEM USING A PRIORITY LIST FOR THE TRI-CITY 
19:48:05 AREA.

19:48:11 REFERRALS WILL ALSO COME FROM OUR NAVIGATION CENTER, WHICH WILL OFFER AN 
19:48:17 OPPORTUNITY FOR PARTICIPANTS TO TRANSITION AND STABILIZE FROM THE 
19:48:20 STREET, AND THEN WHEN READY, MOVE INTO PERMANENT HOUSING.

19:48:25 REFERRALS WILL COME FROM OTHER PARTNER ORGANIZATIONS WORKING WITH THE 
19:48:31 HOMELESS, LIKE ABODE, BAY AREA COMMUNITY HEALTH, AND BACS WELLNESS 
19:48:34 CENTER, AS WELL AS FROM CITY DEPARTMENTS SUCH AS HUMAN SERVICES, 
19:48:34 POLICE AND CODE ENFORCEMENT.

19:48:42 10% OF THE UNITS WILL BE SPECIFICALLY DESIGNATED FOR THOSE WITH SEVERE 
19:48:47 MENTAL ILLNESS, WITH AN EARMARKED FUNDING SOURCE WHICH IS CALLED NO 
19:48:48 PLACE LIKE HOME.

19:48:54 STEP UP STAFF WILL ALSO ASSIST THOSE REFERRED THROUGH THE APPLICATION 
19:48:55 PROCESS.

19:49:07 >> Mr. Schoenholz: NO I WOULD LIKE TO EXPLAIN HOW STAFF  ARRIVED AT OUR 
19:49:07 RECOMMENDATION.

19:49:11 AND SHANGRI-LA'S PROPOSAL, THEY IDENTIFIED FOUR PROPERTIES AS 
19:49:15 POTENTIAL HOMEKEY SITES, AND THE FOUR PROPERTIES ARE SHOWN HERE ON THE SLIDE.

19:49:18 ALL FOUR OF THE PROPERTY ARE IN SOUTH FREMONT.

19:49:25 TWO OF THEM, THE MOTEL 6 AND THE DAYS INN, ARE LOCATED BETWEEN INTERSTATE 
19:49:27 680 AND THE BART TRACKS.

19:49:34 THE OTHER TWO, THE GOOD NITE INN AND THE HAMPTON INN ARE LOCATED WEST OF 
19:49:35 INTERSTATE 880.

19:49:41 AND THE NUMBERS IN PARENTHESES INDICATE THE NUMBER OF ROOMS IN EACH HOTEL.

19:49:52 THIS SLIDE SHOWS PHOTOS OF EACH OF THE FOUR PROPERTIES, AND THEY RANGE IN 
19:49:57 NUMBER OF ROOMS FROM 48 AT THE DAYS INN TO 156 AT MOTEL 6.

19:50:06 SO EARLY ON, STAFF DETERMINED THAT IT WOULD BE IMPRACTICAL TO PURSUE MORE 
19:50:11 THAN ONE HOMEKEY PROJECT SO WE CONCENTRATE ON IDENTIFYING THE BEST 
19:50:14 SITE TO BRING FORWARD TO COUNCIL.

19:50:19 IN EVALUATING THE FOUR POSSIBLE SITE, STAFF FOCUSED ON FOUR FACTORS.

19:50:27 THE DEVELOPMENT COST, THE OPERATING COST, THE SUITABILITY OF THE LOCATION 
19:50:30 FOR PERMANENT HOUSING, AND THE IMPACT THAT THE PROJECT WOULD HAVE ON 
19:50:32 REDUCING CHRONIC HOMELESSNESS.

19:50:39 DEVELOPMENT COSTS ON A PROJECT WILL BE ENTIRELY THE RESPONSIBILITY OF 
19:50:44 SHANGRI-LA, USING A COMBINATION OF STATE HOMEKEY FUNDS AND PRIVATE 
19:50:44 CAPITAL.

19:50:50 HOWEVER, THE LESS EXPENSIVE THE COST OF DEVELOPMENT, THE MORE SHANGRI-LA CAN 
19:50:56 CONTRIBUTE TO THE COST OF SUPPORTIVE SERVICES, SO LOWER COST OF DEVELOPMENT 
19:51:00 ALSO BENEFITS THE CITY AND THE OVERALL FINANCIAL VIABILITY OF THE PROJECT.

19:51:04 AND AS YOU CAN SEE HERE, THE  PER-UNIT COST OF DEVELOPMENT IS CONSIDERABLY 
19:51:08 LOWER AT THE MOTEL 6 THAN AT ANY OF THE OTHER POTENTIAL PROJECT SITES.

19:51:19 THE HOMEKEY GRANT APPLICATION REQUIRES THE PROJECT TO DEMONSTRATE SECURED 
19:51:23 FUNDING FOR OPERATIONS AND SUPPORTIVE SERVICES FOR THE FIRST FIVE YEARS OF 
19:51:23 THE PROJECT.

19:51:31 THE COST PER UNIT AS SHOWN HERE IS A COMBINATION OF THE RENTAL SUBSIDY 
19:51:35 NEEDED FOR EACH UNIT AND THE COST OF PROVIDING SUPPORTIVE SERVICES TO EACH 
19:51:35 TENANT.

19:51:41 AGAIN, THE COST PER UNIT AT THE MOTEL 6 IS CONSIDERABLY LOWER THAN FOR THE 
19:51:42 OTHER THREE PROPERTIES.

19:51:48 THIS IS DIRECTLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE LOWER DEVELOPMENT COST PER UNIT WHICH 
19:51:54 ALLOWS FOR SHANGRI-LA TO COMPLETELY OFFSET THE COST OF PROVIDING 
19:51:57 SUPPORTIVE SERVICES AT THE MOTEL 6 SITE.

19:52:06 STAFF ALSO ANALYZED EACH PROJECT BASED ON THE LOCATIONAL CRITERIA LISTED ON 
19:52:07 THE SLIDE.

19:52:14 EACH OF THE 10 CRITERIA WAS ASSIGNED A SCORE OF 1, AND MOTEL 6 SCORED THE 
19:52:17 HIGHEST, WITH 6 OUT OF 10.

19:52:22 I WOULD NOTE THAT THERE ISN'T TECHNICALLY INDOOR SERVICE DELIVERY 
19:52:27 SPACE AT THE MOTEL 6, BUT AS PART OF THE REHABILITATION, THE DEVELOPER HAS 
19:52:32 BUDGETED TO ADD A 4500 TO 5,000 SQUARE FOOT PORTABLE BUILDING IN THE PARKING 
19:52:34 LOT FOR THAT PURPOSE.

19:52:38 SO THE PROJECT GOT A POINT FOR SERVICE DELIVERY SPACE.

19:52:44 I'D ALSO NOTE THAT THE FIRE MARSHAL SEPARATELY REVIEWED THESE SITES FOR 
19:52:50 THE POSSIBILITY OF CONFLICTS BETWEEN A RESIDENTIAL USE AND NEARBY INDUSTRIAL 
19:52:50 USES.

19:52:54 AND THE FIRE MARSHAL INDICATED THAT THE POTENTIAL FOR CONFLICT WAS HIGHER FOR 
19:52:59 THE TWO PROPERTIES WEST OF 880, THE GOOD NITE INN AND HAMPTON INN, THAN 
19:53:03 FOR THE MOTEL 6 OR THE DAYS INN.

19:53:05 IT LOOKS LIKE WE WENT TO THE NEXT SLIDE ALREADY.

19:53:12 SO BASED ON OUR EVALUATION, STAFF IS RECOMMENDING THE MOTEL 6 SITE.

19:53:20 ON ALL THE CRITERIA WE LOOKED  AT, COST PER UNIT FOR ACQUISITION AND REHAB, 
19:53:23 COST PER UNIT FOR OPERATIONS AND  SERVICES, HIGHEST NUMBER OF UNITS 
19:53:27 WHICH WOULD SERVE THE MOST INDIVIDUALS IN NEED, AND THE HIGHEST RANK ON 
19:53:28 LOCATIONAL CRITERIA.

19:53:34 AND ALSO SORT OF OUTSIDE OF THOSE CRITERIA PER THE FIRE MARSHAL'S 
19:53:37 REVIEW, IT'S ONE OF THE TWO PROPERTIES WITH THE  FEWEST CONCERNS ABOUT 
19:53:40 CONFLICTS WITH INDUSTRIAL USES.

19:53:49 THIS SLIDE PROVIDES MORE DETAIL REGARDING THE CITY'S FINANCIAL 
19:53:53 COMMITMENT IF WE MOVE FORWARD WITH THE MOTEL 6 SITE.

19:53:57 AS NOTED PREVIOUSLY, THE APPLICATION MUST SHOW THAT FUNDING IS AVAILABLE 
19:54:00 FOR THE FIRST FIVE YEARS OF SITE OPERATIONS.

19:54:08 AT THE MOTEL 6 SITE, TOTAL  FIVE-YEAR COSTS FOR OPERATIONS ARE APPROXIMATELY $14.6 MILLION.

19:54:16 IF THE CITY'S HOMEKEY GRANT IS SUCCESSFUL, THE STATE WOULD PROVIDE 
19:54:21 $5.24 MILLION IN OPERATING FUNDS IN ADDITION TO THE ACQUISITION AND REHAB 
19:54:21  DOLLARS.

19:54:31 STAFF HAS IDENTIFIED AN ADDITIONAL 2.59 MILLION FROM EXISTING NON-GENERAL FUND 
19:54:36 SOURCES THAT CAN BE DEDICATED TO THE PROJECT, INCLUDING $750,000 IN 
19:54:42 COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT BLOCK GRANT FUNDING THAT THE CITIZENS ADVISORY 
19:54:47 COMMUNITY IS RECOMMENDING BE ALLOCATED TO THE PROJECT.

19:54:50 THE REMAINING GAP IS ABOUT $6.8 MILLION.

19:54:54 STAFF IS ANTICIPATING THAT MUCH OR ALL OF THIS GAP WILL ULTIMATELY BE COVERED 
19:54:57 BY OUTSIDE FUNDING SOURCES.

19:55:01 WE HAVE ALREADY APPLIED OR ARE IN THE PROCESS OF APPLYING FOR $6.6 MILLION 
19:55:06 IN OUTSIDE FUNDS, AND THIS IS KIND OF HOT OFF THE PRESS, I'M HAPPY TO REPORT 
19:55:12 THAT WE RECEIVED WORD FROM ALAMEDA COUNTY STAFF EARLIER TODAY THAT ONE OF 
19:55:18 OUR GRANT APPLICATIONS FOR $3 MILLION IN AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN ACT FUNDS WILL 
19:55:22 BE RECOMMENDED FOR BOARD OF SUPERVISORS' APPROVAL IN MARCH.

19:55:29 IF IT IS APPROVED AS EXPECTED, THE NEED FOR CITY AFFORDABLE HOUSING FUNDS FOR 
19:55:30 THE PROJECT WILL BE REDUCED BY $3 MILLION.

19:55:35 WE ALSO PLAN ON PURSUING ADDITIONAL FUNDING  OPPORTUNITIES, NOTABLY 
19:55:40 SECTION 8 VOUCHERS AND FUNDING FROM ALAMEDA COUNTY MEASURE W, WHEN THOSE 
19:55:40 OPPORTUNITIES ARISE.

19:55:44 HOWEVER, FOR PURPOSES OF THE APPLICATION, STAFF IS RECOMMENDING 
19:55:50 THAT COUNCIL COMMIT ABOUT $6.8 MILLION FROM THE CITY'S AFFORDABLE HOUSING 
19:55:53 FUND AS A RESERVE THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE TO COVER ANY UNFILLED 
19:55:54 FUNDING GAP.

19:56:04 ONE IMPORTANT THING TO NOTE IS THAT STATE LEGISLATION EXPLICITLY STATES 
19:56:07 THAT HOMEKEY PROJECTS ARE EXEMPT FROM THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY 
19:56:14 ACT IF THEY MEET CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS, INCLUDING PAYING PREVAILING WAGE FOR 
19:56:18  CONSTRUCTION, DEED RESTRICTING UNITS AS AFFORDABLE FOR 55  YEARS, AND USING 
19:56:19 PUBLIC FUNDS FOR SITE ACQUISITION.

19:56:22 THIS PROJECT WOULD QUALIFY FOR THAT EXEMPTION.

19:56:28 I WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT THE STATE LEGISLATION DEEMS ALL HOMEKEY PROJECTS 
19:56:33 AS IN CONFORMANCE WITH LOCAL ZONING, SO NO  DISCRETIONARY LAND USE APPROVALS 
19:56:35 WILL BE NEEDED FOR THIS PROJECT.

19:56:43 WE ALSO WANTED TO TOUCH ON PLANS FOR COMMUNITY OUTREACH.

19:56:49 STEP UP WILL TAKE THE LEAD ON COMMUNITY OUTREACH IN COLLABORATION WITH CITY 
19:56:50 STAFF.

19:56:54 THEIR OUTREACH WILL BEGIN IN THE PREDEVELOPMENT PHASE AND CONTINUE 
19:56:58 THROUGH CONSTRUCTION UP TO A YEAR AFTER THE SITE IS OPERATIONAL.

19:57:03 STEP UP WORKS TO BUILD PERSONAL CONNECTIONS WITH IMMEDIATE NEIGHBORS 
19:57:10 AND INVITES INPUT ON HOW THE STEP UP OPERATION CAN COULD EXIST AND BE 
19:57:11 PRODUCTIVE WITH THEIR NEIGHBORS.

19:57:15 AND IN ADDITION TO WORKING WITH NEIGHBORS, STEP UP ALSO WORKS TO 
19:57:19 DEVELOP POSITIVE RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHER SERVICE PROVIDERS IN THE AREA, 
19:57:24 AS WELL AS A POLICE DEPARTMENT, THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE, AND OTHER 
19:57:25 ORGANIZATIONS.

19:57:33 IF COUNCIL APPROVES THE APPLICATION SUBMITTAL TONIGHT, THE PROJECT 
19:57:34 SCHEDULE LOOKS LIKE THIS.

19:57:42 WE'LL SUBMIT PRIOR TO  JANUARY 31ST TO QUALIFY FOR THE $1.5 MILLION EARLY 
19:57:42 APPLICATION BONUS.

19:57:47 WE WOULD EXPECT A RESPONSE TO OUR APPLICATION IN MARCH, AND IF WE'RE 
19:57:50 AWARDED FUNDS, WE WOULD MOVE IMMEDIATELY INTO THE PERMITTING AND 
19:57:50 CONSTRUCTION PROCESS.

19:57:57 CONSTRUCTION WOULD BE COMPLETED NO LATER THAN MARCH OF 2023, WITH 
19:58:04 OCCUPANCY BY JUNE OF 2023, ALTHOUGH ALL OF US WILL BE DOING OUR DARNDEST TO 
19:58:05 COMPLETE IT SOONER.

19:58:17 STAFF'S RECOMMENDATION IS LAID OUT IN THE REPORT, IS TO AUTHORIZE A HOMEKEY 
19:58:23 APPLICATION TO THE STATE FOR $40.2 MILLION, FOR COUNCIL TO MAKE THE 
19:58:28 NECESSARY CEQA EXEMPTION FINDINGS, FOR COUNCIL TO APPROVE CITY FUNDING 
19:58:33 COMMITMENTS FOR THE PROJECT, TO AUTHORIZE EXECUTION OF A MEMORANDUM OF 
19:58:38 UNDERSTANDING WITH SHANGRI-LA INDUSTRIES AND STEP UP, AND TO 
19:58:40 AUTHORIZE EXECUTION OF ALL NECESSARY STATE GRANT DOCUMENTS.

19:58:46 AND BEFORE WE CONCLUDE THE PRESENTATION, I WOULD LIKE TO 
19:58:51 ACKNOWLEDGE THE WORK OF MANY STAFF MEMBERS WHO DID THE HEAVY LIFTING TO 
19:58:53 GET US TO THIS POINT.

19:59:07 THEY'VE ALL DONE A GREAT JOB OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF MONTHS TO PULL TOGETHER 
19:59:12 THE MANY DIFFERENT COMPONENTS OF THIS COMPLEX PROJECT, AND AS ALWAYS, WE 
19:59:16 ALSO GOT GREAT SUPPORT FROM THE ENTIRE CITY ORGANIZATION, IN PARTICULAR, ON 
19:59:23 THIS PROJECT I'D LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE PLANNING STAFF, POLICE, FIRE, FINANCE 
19:59:27 DEPARTMENT, AND THE CITY ATTORNEY'S OFFICE FOR THEIR ASSISTANCE.

19:59:28 NEXT SLIDE, PLEASE.

19:59:33 SO THAT CONCLUDES OUR PRESENTATION.

19:59:37 THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE, AND WE'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS.

19:59:48 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION, BOTH SUZANNE SHENFIL AND 
19:59:48 DAN.

19:59:52 I'D LIKE TO TURN TO OUR COUNCIL FIRST FOR CLARIFYING QUESTIONS, THOUGH I DO 
19:59:54 KNOW WE HAVE QUITE A FEW SPEAKERS TONIGHT TOO.

19:59:58 SO ARE THERE ANY CLARIFYING QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME?

20:00:00 AND WE'LL GO BACK TO COMMENTS AFTER HEARING FROM OUR SPEAKERS.

20:00:05 CLARIFYING QUESTIONS, COUNCILMEMBER COX?

20:00:19 APOLOGY, YOU'RE ON MUTE.

20:00:23 >> Councilmember Cox: WITH THE  MOU THAT YOU'VE INDICATED, IS THAT A 
20:00:23 BINDING AGREEMENT?

20:00:34 >> Mr. Schoenholz: I'M SORRY, IS THE MOU A BINDING AGREEMENT?

20:00:35 YES.

20:00:37 >> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.

20:00:40 AND IT'S ONLY GOOD FOR THAT ONE YEAR OR IS THAT SOMETHING THAT IT'S OVER THE 
20:00:45 FIRST PHASE OF CONSTRUCTION AND THEN GOES INTO A DIFFERENT SUPPORTIVE 
20:00:50  SERVICES -- I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THIS TYPE OF MOU.

20:00:53 AS OPPOSED TO DOING A REGULAR CONTRACT.

20:00:59 >> Mr. Schoenholz: THE MOU WILL LAY OUT THE ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF ALL 
20:01:06 THERE'S PARTIES STARTING WITH THE SITE DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION THROUGH 
20:01:08 OPERATIONS.

20:01:15 WITH HOMEKEY, REALLY THE WAY HOMEKEY IS SET UP, THE FIRST FIVE YEARS ARE 
20:01:19 REALLY THAT PERIOD THAT'S VERY PRESCRIBED.

20:01:25 THERE'S SORT OF AN UNDERSTANDING THAT AFTER FIVE YEARS, THERE WILL BE NEW 
20:01:31 FUNDING SOURCES THAT WILL NEED TO BE SECURED AND THAT THE PROJECT WILL NEED 
20:01:39 TO TRANSITION INTO SORT OF A LONGER TERM AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECT, SO 
20:01:44 THE MOU REALLY FOCUSED ON THE FIRST FIVE YEARS OF OPERATIONS WITH SORT OF 
20:01:48 A GENERAL AGREEMENT THAT THE PARTIES WANT TO CONTINUE TO WORK TOGETHER TO 
20:01:55 ENSURE THE SUCCESS OF THIS PROJECT THROUGH THE ENTIRE  55-YEAR TERM.

20:01:58 >> Councilmember Cox: SO IT GOES FROM THE FIVE YEARS TO UP TO 55 YEARS IS 
20:02:00 WHAT YOU'RE SAYING?

20:02:03 OKAY.

20:02:08 IS THIS GOING TO BE IN THE CITY OF FREMONT'S NAME FOR OWNERSHIP OF THIS 
20:02:15 WHOLE PROJECT OR IS THIS LEASED OR -- WHO'S REALLY THE OWNER OF THE PROPERTY?

20:02:17 IS IT STILL WITH MOTEL 6?

20:02:21 I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHO'S THE --

20:02:23 >> Mr. Schoenholz: SHANGRI-LA INDUSTRIES WOULD BE THE OWNER OF THE PROPERTY.

20:02:26 THIS IS PRETTY TYPICAL FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS THAT WE DO.

20:02:33 THE CITY DOESN'T OWN AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS, TYPICALLY WE WORK WITH 
20:02:39 AFFORDABLE DEVELOPERS, WE PROVIDE FUNDING AND WE HAVE AGREEMENTS IN 
20:02:48 PLACE TO ENSURE THAT THE PROPERTY IS OPERATED IN COMPLIANCE WITH STATE AND 
20:02:52 FEDERAL RULES AND ALSO WHATEVER ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS WE IMPOSE ON 
20:02:53 THE PROJECT.

20:02:53 >> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.

20:02:55 I APPRECIATE THE CLARIFICATION.

20:03:02 I'LL HOLD OFF AND I HAVE MORE QUESTIONS BUT I WILL CERTAINLY HEED TO OUR 
20:03:02 PUBLIC COMMENTS.

20:03:04 THANK YOU.

20:03:07 >> Mayor Mei: SURE.

20:03:09 VICE MAYOR SALWAN, CLARIFYING QUESTIONS.

20:03:10 >> Vice Mayor Salwan: THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR.

20:03:12 THANK YOU FOR THE DETAILED PRESENTATION.

20:03:13 I APPRECIATE THAT GREATLY.

20:03:19 I JUST HAD A QUESTION ABOUT THE REENA NUMBER, I WANT TO MAKE SURE I 
20:03:20 UNDERSTOOD THAT.

20:03:30 SO TO THESE UNITS QUALIFY FOR THE VERY LOW INCOME RHNA  NUMBERS, DOES THAT 
20:03:31 FULFILL SOME OF THOSE REQUIREMENTS?

20:03:35 >> YEAH, IF WE MOVE FORWARD WITH THE PROJECT, WE'LL BE ABLE TO COUNT THESE 
20:03:41 150-SOME UNITS TOWARDS OUR REGIONAL HOUSING NEED GOAL.

20:03:48 

20:03:52 >> Vice Mayor Salwan: SO THE ACTION TODAY, ONE IS AUTHORIZING THE GRANT, 
20:03:53 OR TO APPLY FOR THE GRANT.

20:03:55 SECOND IS WE ARE ENTERING INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH THE PARTIES.

20:03:57 SO THERE WAS ALSO SOME MENTION OF OUTREACH.

20:04:04 SO WHAT STAGE DOES THE OUTREACH HAPPEN, AND IS THIS -- ONCE WE GO AHEAD, IS IT 
20:04:08 PRETTY MUCH A DONE DEAL OR IS THERE SOME OTHER ACTION THAT WILL COME BACK 
20:04:09 TO US?

20:04:12 I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE TIME FRAME.

20:04:20 >> Mr. Schoenholz: SO I MAY DEFER SOME OF THIS TO OUR SERVICE PROVIDER STEP 
20:04:20 UP.

20:04:29 BUT WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THAT OUTREACH WILL BEGIN IMMEDIATELY IN TERMS OF 
20:04:36 WORKING WITH THE CITY AND WITH SOME OF THE PARTNER ORGANIZATIONS, AND I SEE 
20:04:45  TODD LIPKA FROM STEP UP IS ON, MAYBE YOU CAN ADDRESS WHEN  BROADER 
20:04:47 COMMUNITY OUTREACH WILL TAKE PLACE.

20:04:52 >> THE KEY ACTIVITY FIRST WILL BE SUBMISSION TO THE STATE FOR HOMEKEY 
20:04:57 FUNDING, AND THEN ONCE THAT'S DONE, WE'LL START TO DO SOME INITIAL 
20:05:02 OUTREACH TO SERVICE PROVIDERS AND OTHERS, AND THEN WE'LL DO A HIGHER 
20:05:08 LEVEL -- AND TO NEIGHBORS IN THE AREA OF THE SITE, AND THEN CERTAINLY AS WE 
20:05:12 PROGRESS ON THE HOMEKEY APPLICATION AND WHEN IT'S  FUNDED, WE'LL HAVE A MUCH 
20:05:17 MORE ESCALATED OUTREACH ACTIVITY WITH OTHER SERVICE PROVIDERS, WITH 
20:05:21 COMMUNITY GROUPS, WITH NEIGHBORHOOD ORGANIZATIONS IF NEEDED.

20:05:28 SO DURING THAT TIME WE'LL DO AN ASSESSMENT AND WORK WITH THE CITY ON 
20:05:33 WHO THOSE STEAK HOLDERS WILL BE AND OUTREACH A CAMPAIGN FOR THEM.

20:05:41 >> Mayor Mei: VICE MAYOR, DO YOU STILL HAVE A QUESTION?

20:05:43 >> Vice Mayor Salwan: SORRY, JUST A FOLLOW-UP.

20:05:47 SO BASICALLY WILL IT COME BACK FOR AN ACTION AFTER THIS OR IS THIS PRETTY 
20:05:49 MUCH A DONE DEAL?

20:05:56 >> Mr. Schoenholz: REALLY, THE APPROVALS TONIGHT WILL BASICALLY 
20:05:59 PROVIDE US EVERYTHING WE NEED TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THE PROJECT.

20:06:09 IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THERE WILL BE ACTIONS THAT THE COUNCIL WILL NEED TO 
20:06:15 TAKE, RESOLUTIONS FOR OTHER FUNDING SOURCES, THAT KIND OF THING SO YOU MAY 
20:06:19 SEE COMPONENTS COMING BACK, BUT THIS IS A DECISION ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT TO 
20:06:24 MOVE FORWARD WITH IT, ASSUMING WE ARE SUCCESSFUL IN GETTING A GRANT FROM THE 
20:06:24 STATE.

20:06:25 >> Vice Mayor Salwan: THANK YOU.

20:06:27 SO TWO QUICK FOLLOW-UP.

20:06:32 ONE IS WHAT KIND OF SUPPORT WILL BE PROVIDED AT THIS NEW SITE?

20:06:38 WILL WE HAVE COUNSELORS, ALL OF THAT KIND OF STUFF, WHAT KIND OF SUPPORT 
20:06:39 WILL BE PROVIDED?

20:06:49 >> Ms. Shenfil: TODD COULD ANSWER THAT QUESTION ALSO FOR STEP UP.

20:06:53 >> OUR MODEL IS TO PROVIDE ONE FULL TIME CASE MANAGER ON SITE PER 25 
20:06:53 TENANTS.

20:06:56 SO WE'LL HAVE NUMEROUS CASE MANAGERS.

20:07:03 THEIR ROLE, THEY'LL HAVE OFFICES ON SITE AND THEIR ROLE IS  100% -- 
20:07:06 CHECKING IN ON A DAY BY DAY BASIS.

20:07:11 WE'VE DONE MANY MOTELS AND WHAT WE FIND IS IN THE FIRST THREE TO NINE MONTHS, 
20:07:16 THESE CASE MANAGERS ARE REALLY WORKING WHAT WE CALL ADLs, ACTIVITIES OF DAILY 
20:07:16 LIVING.

20:07:21 PEOPLE HAVE TO UNLEARN THEIR SURVIVAL SKILLS THAT THEY  LEARNED TO STAY 
20:07:25 HOMELESS, AND LEARN HOW TO COOK A MEAL, HOW TO SHOP, HOW TO CLEAN AN 
20:07:27 APARTMENT, HOW TO EVEN SLEEP IN THEIR BED.

20:07:31 SO THE CASE MANAGERS ARE REALLY WORKING ONE TO ONE INTENSIVELY DURING THIS 
20:07:35 TIME PERIOD.

20:07:39 AS TENANTS STABILIZE, THEY TAKE A COORDINATION ROLE WITH -- I MEAN, 
20:07:45 THEY'RE GOING TO DO IT ALL THE TIME, BUT AS TENANTS STABILIZE, INTEGRATING 
20:07:49 AND COORDINATING SERVICES THAT THE TENANTS ARE GETTING FROM OTHER OUTSIDE 
20:07:52 PROVIDERS, WHETHER IT'S HEALTHCARE, MENTAL HEALTHCARE, ANY COMMUNITY 
20:07:57 SUPPORTS, AND ALL WORKING TOGETHER WITH THOSE PROVIDER ORGANIZATIONS TO MAKE 
20:08:01 SURE THE CARE IS COORDINATED AND EVERYONE IS WORKING IN THE SAME 
20:08:01 DIRECTION.

20:08:06 WE'RE ALSO DOING PROPERTY MANAGEMENT SO WE HAVE NOT ONLY THE FULL TIME STAFF 
20:08:10 ON SITE WITH OFFICES, BUT WE'LL HAVE AT LEAST TWO LIVE-IN RESIDENT 
20:08:17  MANAGERS WHO DO THE PROPERTY MANAGEMENT FUNCTION, MAINTENANCE, 
20:08:20 COLLECTION OF RENTS, ET CETERA, BUT WE THINK OF THEM AS PART OF THE TREATMENT 
20:08:20 TEAM.

20:08:24 THEY'RE THE EYES AND THE EARS BECAUSE THEY LIVE THERE ON SITE SO THEY SEE 
20:08:32 WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE EVENING HOURS, AND OTHER TIMES WHEN THE SUPPORTIVE 
20:08:33 SERVICES STAFF AREN'T THERE.

20:08:38 SO IT'S REALLY A VERY COMPLIMENTARY APPROACH THAT'S WORKED WELL THAT'S 
20:08:45 ENABLED US TO HAVE A GREAT RETENTION RATE OF CLIENTS.

20:08:52 >> Vice Mayor Salwan: THERE'S A LOT OF ENCAMPMENTS AROUND THE WARM STREET 
20:08:59  -- SO WE CAN REDUCE SOME OF THE IMPACTS?

20:09:02 >> Ms. Shenfil: I WOULD SAY YES, DEFINITELY, THEY WILL BE A KIND OF 
20:09:10 TARGET GROUP THAT WE WILL ENCOURAGE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS OPPORTUNITY FOR 
20:09:11 SURE.

20:09:12 >> Vice Mayor Salwan: THANK YOU.

20:09:15 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

20:09:22 COUNCILMEMBER SHAO, CLARIFYING QUESTIONS.

20:09:23 >> Councilmember Shao: THANK  YOU, MADAME MAYOR.

20:09:27 I'M NOT SURE WHETHER I READ IT CORRECTLY, BUT THE CONSTRUCTION WOULD 
20:09:29 ONLY LAST FOR THREE  MONTHS?

20:09:37 STARTING AT MARCH 2023 AND THEN THE TENANTS WOULD MOVE IN IN JUNE 2023?

20:09:42 >> Mr. Schoenholz: NO, I'M SORRY IF THAT WAS CONFUSING.

20:09:47 CONSTRUCTION WOULD START AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AFTER THE AWARD IS MADE IN 
20:09:51 MARCH OF 2022.

20:09:53 IT WOULD TAKE UP TO A YEAR TO DO THE CONSTRUCTION.

20:09:57 WE DON'T THINK IT WILL PROBABLY TAKE THE ENTIRE YEAR, BUT WE HAVE THAT LONG 
20:10:03 PER THE TERMS OF THE STATE GRANT, AND THEN WHEN CONSTRUCTION IS COMPLETED IN 
20:10:09 MARCH OF 2023, WE THEN WOULD HAVE THREE MONTHS TO MOVE PEOPLE IN, SO THE 
20:10:15 PROJECT WOULD NEED TO BE FULLY OCCUPIED BY JUNE OF 2023.

20:10:18 >> Councilmember Shao: THANK  YOU.

20:10:24 >> Mayor Mei: IS THAT YOUR ONLY CLARIFYING QUESTION?

20:10:24 >> Councilmember Shao: THAT'S CORRECT.

20:10:26 I HAVE SOME COMMENTS.

20:10:27 >> Mayor Mei: OKAY.

20:10:28 COMMENTS, WE'LL COME BACK TO.

20:10:30 IS THERE ANY OTHER CLARIFYING QUESTIONS?

20:10:35 I SEE COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN -- VICE MAYOR SALWAN AND COUNCILMEMBER COX, 
20:10:36 YOUR HANDS ARE STILL RAISED.

20:10:37 IS THAT JUST FROM BEFORE?

20:10:39 >> Councilmember Cox: I IT HAVE SOME MORE CLARIFYING QUESTIONS.

20:10:41 >> Mayor Mei: OKAY.

20:10:42 GO AHEAD.

20:10:52 >> Councilmember Cox: WHEN YOU REFERRED TO INDOOR SERVICE DELIVERY, COULD YOU 
20:10:54 REPHRASE THAT OF WHAT THAT REALLY MEANS?

20:10:57 SO I'M UNDERSTANDING THE SAME TERMINOLOGY AS WHAT YOU'RE USING HERE?

20:11:02 >> Mr. Schoenholz: WHEN WE WERE LOOKING AT THE DIFFERENT SITES, WE WANTED TO 
20:11:07 BE SURE THAT THERE WAS SOME INDOOR SPACE, BASICALLY FOR OFFICES AND FOR 
20:11:10 CASE  MANAGERS AND SO ON TO DO THEIR WORK.

20:11:16 AND BECAUSE THAT SPACE IS NECESSARY FOR THESE PROJECTS TO BE SUCCESSFUL, AND 
20:11:21 SO I WAS JUST MENTIONING THAT AT THE MOTEL 6, THERE ISN'T REALLY ANY SPACE 
20:11:26 LIKE THAT CURRENTLY, BUT IT'S PLAN FOR THE PROJECT IN A PORTABLE THAT WILL BE 
20:11:33 ADDED, AND SO WE GAVE CREDIT TO THE MOTEL SIX SITE FOR THAT SPACE BECAUSE 
20:11:35 IT WILL HAVE THAT SPACE AT THE TIME THAT IT OPENS.

20:11:38 >> Councilmember Cox: OH, I SEE.

20:11:39 OKAY.

20:11:41 I WAS THINKING IT WAS SOMETHING ELSE.

20:11:44 I'M GLAD THAT WE CAN NOW TALK APPLES TO APPLES THERE.

20:11:56 ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS I WANTED TO CLARIFY WAS THAT -- ARE THERE GOING TO 
20:12:03 BE ANY SITUATIONS  THAT -- I GUESS THOSE THAT HAVE MENTAL CONDITIONS, 
20:12:08 THAT YOU'RE NOT ABLE TO BE ABLE TO MANAGE, ARE THOSE THEN REFERRALS BACK 
20:12:13 TO OUR PARTNER ORGANIZATIONS OR ARE THESE PART OF THE UP-FRONT SELECTION 
20:12:19 THAT'S GOING IN AND YOU'RE PRE-EVALUATING THE UNHOUSED AS THEY 
20:12:24 GET SELECTED TO GO INTO THE MOTEL 6?

20:12:29 >> Mr. Schoenholz: TOD?

20:12:33 >> SO THIS TARGET, BECAUSE OF THE BONUSES, WILL BE TARGETING CHRONICALLY 
20:12:37 HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS, AND WE KNOW THE INCIDENCE OF MENTAL ILLNESS IS PRETTY 
20:12:38 HIGH IN THE CHRONIC POPULATION.

20:12:42 STEP UP IS A FULL BLOWN MENTAL HEALTH SERVICE PROVIDER.

20:12:46 WE CONTRACT WITH A NUMBER OF COUNTIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA WITH THEIR 
20:12:48 DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH OR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH.

20:12:54 WE DON'T HAVE SPECIFIC FUNDING FOR THAT IN THIS PROJECT, SO THE TEAM ON SITE 
20:13:00 WILL REALLY,  ASSUMING AN INDIVIDUAL IS REFERRED FROM AN EXISTING  AGENCY, 
20:13:04 THAT COULD BE A MENTAL HEALTH AGENCY, SO WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS MAINTAIN THAT 
20:13:08 PERSON'S MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES WITH THAT EXISTING PROVIDER ORGANIZATION, 
20:13:12 THAT'S PART OF THE CASE COORDINATION, AND IF THE INDIVIDUAL DOES NOT HAVE A 
20:13:16 PROVIDER, THAT'S PART OF THE TEAM'S ROLE, IS TO CONNECT THEM WITH A MENTAL 
20:13:19 HEALTH SERVICE PROVIDER IN THE COMMUNITY AND ENSURE THAT LINKAGE AND 
20:13:20 SUPPORT THAT RELATIONSHIP.

20:13:22 >> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.

20:13:28 AND I THOUGHT IT WAS WONDERFUL HAVING INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES, AND HOW MANY 
20:13:40 OF THOSE  150-SOMETHING ROOMS, HOW MANY CAN BE SET UP FOR FAMILIES, AND IS IT 
20:13:49 LIKE MORE OF A LIMITED NUMBER OF THAT 150 OR ARE THERE MORE SINGLE BEDDED 
20:13:55 ROOMS?  WHAT'S THE CONCEPT THAT YOU CAN SHARE OR WHAT THE DESIGNS OR 
20:13:57 INTENTIONS ARE AT THIS POINT?

20:14:01 >> Ms. Shenfil: BECAUSE OF THE SPACE ARRANGEMENTS, I THINK THIS PROJECT IS 
20:14:04 GOING TO PREDOMINANTLY SERVE SINGLES OR PERHAPS COUPLES.

20:14:07 BUT NOT LARGE FAMILIES AT THIS POINT.

20:14:15 >> Councilmember Cox: ANY  COUPLES WITH ONE CHILD, IS THAT EVEN A 
20:14:15 CONSIDERATION?

20:14:20 >> Ms. Shenfil: I WOULD THINK POTENTIALLY A MOM WITH A SMALL CHILD, 
20:14:21 BUT NOT A LARGE FAMILY.

20:14:25 >> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.

20:14:28 I WAS JUST CURIOUS ON THAT ASPECT.

20:14:37 AND KIND OF RIDING ALSO ON MY COLLEAGUE SALWAN, COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN, I WANTED 
20:14:44 TO MAKE SURE -- HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT -- I KNOW WE'RE GOING TO DO THE COUNT 
20:14:50 IN FEBRUARY, BUT HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT WE ARE ACTUALLY HAVING THE FUNDS AND 
20:14:54 APPLY THEM TO THE UNHOUSED THAT ARE HERE IN FREMONT?

20:15:01 AND I WOULD LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THAT AS PART OF OUR FIRST PRIORITY, AND EVEN 
20:15:07 THOSE THAT MAYBE LOCATED NEAR SCHOOLS, NEAR CHURCHES TO KIND OF HELP CLEAR 
20:15:14 THE WAYS THERE, AND PUT THEM IN A VERY -- THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT WE'RE 
20:15:16 DESIGNING, I MEAN, HOW MUCH INFLUENCE DO WE HAVE?

20:15:22 BECAUSE I KEEP HEARING RUMORS THAT, YEAH, I HAVE SOME HERE BUT WE'RE GOING 
20:15:25 TO END UP TAKING PEOPLE THAT ARE A LOT MORE OUTSIDE OF FREMONT.

20:15:29 HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT WE CAN SHARE WITH OUR RESIDENTS AND THOSE THAT ARE ON 
20:15:36 THE CALL  TODAY, AND ALL THE CITY STAFF AND ALL OF THE -- MY COLLEAGUES HERE 
20:15:41 ON THE COUNCIL, HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT FREMONT 
20:15:48 RESIDENTS,  UNHOUSED, ARE GOING TO HAVE THE TOP PRIORITY, OR IS THERE SOME 
20:15:53 CONDITIONS IN ACCEPTING THIS MONEY THAT WE HAVE TO TAKE A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE?

20:15:54 CAN YOU DISCLOSE THAT?

20:15:57 IS THERE SOME WAY YOU CAN HELP US UNDERSTAND THAT?

20:16:01 BECAUSE THOSE ARE THE QUESTIONS THAT I'M GETTING CONSTANTLY  ASKED, HOW DO 
20:16:01 YOU KNOW?

20:16:05 >> Ms. Shenfil: SO THE COUNTY HAS WHAT'S CALLED A COORDINATED ENTRY 
20:16:06 SYSTEM.

20:16:14 AND FAMILY RESOURCE CENTER IS ONE OF TWO ACCESS POINTS WHERE WE ACTUALLY 
20:16:18 WORK WITH THE HOMELESS, WE HELP THEM  PROBLEM-SOLVE AND THEN DEPENDING ON 
20:16:26 THEIR SITUATION, THEY ARE ENTERED INTO THE HOMELESS MANAGEMENT INFORMATION 
20:16:34 SYSTEM, AND THEIR SITUATION IS LOOKED AT IN TERMS OF THEIR AGE, HOW LONG 
20:16:37 THEY'VE BEEN ON THE STREET, THEIR VULNERABILITY, ET CETERA, AND THERE'S 
20:16:41 SORT OF A PRIORITIZATION OF PEOPLE.

20:16:46 AND THEN THAT LIST WHICH IS A COUNTY LIST IS DIVIDED GEOGRAPHICALLY.

20:16:52 SO WE CAN PULL FROM THAT LIST FOR OUR REGION, WHICH IS  FREMONT, NEWARK AND 
20:16:53 UNION CITY.

20:17:00 SO AS WITH THE HOUSING NAVIGATION CENTER, THE BULK OF THE PARTICIPANTS 
20:17:05 HAVE BEEN  HOMELESS PERSONS FROM FREMONT WITH A SMATTERING OF FOLKS 
20:17:07 ALSO FROM NEWARK AND UNION CITY.

20:17:17 BUT THAT LIST IS ONE OF THE PRIMARY WAYS THAT WE WILL IDENTIFY PEOPLE.

20:17:18 >> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.

20:17:19 LET'S KEEP PUSHING ON THAT.

20:17:20 I APPRECIATE THAT.

20:17:31 I ALSO WANTED TO FIND OUT, I GUESS THIS WOULD BE GOING TOWARDS STEP UP AND 
20:17:32 SHANGRI-LA.

20:17:39 I WANTED TO FIND OUT THE COLLABORATION AS PEOPLE GET OPPORTUNITY TO 
20:17:46 TRANSITION INTO THESE HOUSING UNITS, IS THERE GOING TO BE A COLLABORATION WITH 
20:17:50 OUR BUILDING AND TRADES COUNCIL AND SEEING HOW THEY CAN ALSO PROVIDE 
20:17:56 ASSISTANCE AND ANY TYPE OF CONSTRUCTION BUT ALSO  PROVIDING APPRENTICE AND JOB 
20:18:04 OPPORTUNITIES TO LINK AND HELP OUR RESIDENTS TO HAVE A BETTER QUALITY OF 
20:18:08 LIFE, AND SO I WANTED TO FIND OUT IF THERE WAS SOME COLLABORATIONS IN THAT 
20:18:13 PART AND WHAT HAS BEEN YOUR EXPERIENCE BEFORE IN WORKING IN THAT ARENA?

20:18:18 >> I'LL TAKE THAT QUESTION AND IT'S A VERY GOOD ONE,  COUNCILWOMAN COX.

20:18:24 SO EMPLOYMENT IS AN IMPORTANT SERVICE THAT WE BUILD IN TO THE HOUSING WITH 
20:18:29 THE CASE MANAGERS TO LINK WITH VARIOUS EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYMENT-RELATED 
20:18:33 SERVICES THAT TYPICALLY PROBABLY IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN UNTIL POST 
20:18:36 STABILIZATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS FOR TENANTS, WHICH COULD BE ANYWHERE 
20:18:40 FROM THREE MONTHS TO A YEAR, DEPENDING ON THE INDIVIDUAL TENANT.

20:18:45 ALSO KEEP IN MIND THAT WHEN YOU'RE TARGETING A CHRONIC POPULATION, THEN 
20:18:50 THERE'S GOING TO BE A HIGH INCIDENCE OF DISABILITY, WHETHER IT'S A PHYSICAL 
20:18:53 DISABILITY, A MENTAL DISABILITY OR PERHAPS EVEN BOTH.

20:18:59 AND WHAT WE DO FIND WITH THAT POPULATION IS THEIR ASPIRATION IS 
20:19:03 GOING TO BE MORE A PART-TIME JOB RATHER THAN A FULL TIME JOB.

20:19:08 THE GOAL IS NOT TYPICALLY FOR THEM TO BECOME SELF SUSTAINING AND TRANSITION 
20:19:12 OUT OF THIS HOUSING, BECAUSE THEY HAVE A DISABILITY, THEY'RE PROBABLY IN MOST 
20:19:16 CASES GOING TO BE MANAGING THAT DISABILITY FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIFE, 
20:19:20 SO MUCH OF THE EMPLOYMENT WILL BE FOCUSED ON PART-TIME 
20:19:22 NON-CAREER-RELATED STUFF.

20:19:27 OR ALSO HAVE EDUCATIONAL SUPPORT, SO HELPING PEOPLE GO BACK TO GET THEIR 
20:19:31 GEDs AND TAKE COMMUNITY COLLEGE CLASSES AND SOME CASES ENTER A FOUR-YEAR 
20:19:31 COLLEGE.

20:19:38 WE DO FIND TO THE EXTENT THAT YOUNG ADULTS ARE PART OF THIS POPULATION, 
20:19:41 THEY'RE HIGHLY ACTIVATED TO GET BACK INTO THE WORKFORCE AND GET BACK INTO 
20:19:42 THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM.

20:19:48 SO I WOULD SAY ON AVERAGE, ABOUT 20% OF OUR RESIDENTS FIND SOME SORT OF 
20:19:50 EMPLOYMENT AND MOST OF THAT'S GOING TO BE PART-TIME EMPLOYMENT.

20:19:54 BUT WE'RE HAPPY TO INTERFACE WITH COMMUNITY GROUPS AND BUSINESS GROUPS 
20:19:56 AND MAKE THOSE OPPORTUNITIES KNOWN TO ALL THE RESIDENTS.

20:20:04 >> Councilmember Cox: THERE IS A LOT OF PART-TIME JOBS RIGHT HERE IN FREMONT, 
20:20:10 AND WE WOULD LOVE LIVE, WORK, PLAY RIGHT HERE IN FREMONT, SO I REALLY 
20:20:18 WOULD LOVE TO SEE HOW THOSE CONNECTIONS ARE ENHANCED AND MAINTAINED FOR THE 
20:20:24 BENEFIT OF THOSE THAT WILL BE IN THAT NEW HOUSING UNIT.

20:20:32 ANOTHER PART THAT I THINK IS REALLY IMPORTANT IS HOW BETTER WE CAN PARTNER 
20:20:35 IN THIS PROJECT WITH THE SMALL BUSINESSES AND HAVING SOME SORT OF 
20:20:40 LOCAL REFERENCES THAT THE SMALL BUSINESSES WOULD BE ABLE TO HELP IN 
20:20:49 SOME WAYS, PROVIDING ANY OTHER PARTNERSHIPS,  ARRANGEMENTS IN THAT 
20:20:52 REGARD, SO I THINK THAT WOULD BE ALSO A  WIN-WIN FOR THIS.

20:20:56 AND HOW HAVE YOU DEMONSTRATED THAT BEFORE IN YOUR PREVIOUS PROJECTS?

20:21:05 >> WELL, WE'RE USUALLY MEMBERS OF THE -- IF THERE'S A BUSINESS IMPROVEMENT 
20:21:08 DISTRICT IN THE  AREA, WE'RE OFTEN MEMBERS OF THE CHAMBER AS AN 
20:21:08 ORGANIZATION.

20:21:16 WE DO HAVE A CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WITH NEIGHBORS AND SINCE MAT  TEL'S TEND TO 
20:21:24 BE IN COMMERCIAL AREAS, THIS -- WE DO HAVE A NEIGHBOR POLICY THAT TALKS 
20:21:28 ABOUT HOW WE ACT IN EVERY COMMUNITY THAT WE'RE IN, AND A LOT OF THAT 
20:21:37 ENGAGEMENT THAT -- CERTAINLY THERE WILL BE OPPORTUNITY FOR PART-TIME JOBS, 
20:21:41 WE'VE PARTNERED WITH CIVIC ORGANIZATIONS TO VOLUNTEER WORK AT A 
20:21:43 PROJECT OR SOLICITING DONATIONINGS.

20:21:50 SO FOR EXAMPLE, TO DO COOKING CLASSES ON SITE IN THE MOTEL AND LOCAL 
20:21:54 BUSINESSES OFTENTIMES DONATED FOOD AND FOOD PRODUCTS FOR THE KITCHEN.

20:22:00 DONATING PART OF WHAT WE DO HAVE TENANTS MOVE INTO A FULLY FURNISHED 
20:22:05 UNIT WITH EVERYTHING IN IT INCLUDING BLANKETS,  TOWELS, FLATWARE, ET 
20:22:09 CETERA, SO WE'VE OFTEN PARTNERED WITH LOCAL ORGANIZATIONS INCLUDING 
20:22:14 BUSINESSES ON RAISING THE MONEY FOR SOME OF THOSE PRODUCTS.

20:22:16 KOCH COX THAT'S GREAT.

20:22:17 I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT.

20:22:21 BECAUSE THAT WAS MY OTHER PART OF MENTIONING THAT, IF THERE WAS A 
20:22:28 COMMUNITY KITCHEN, THAT'S KIND OF SIMILAR TO OUR ABOAT SERVICES IN OTHER 
20:22:30 COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS TO HELP IN THAT REGARD.

20:22:37 AND ALSO YOU HIT UPON COMMUNITY COLLEGE, I WAS 12 YEARS WITH OHLONE SO 
20:22:42 I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT -- WE DO HAVE A WONDERFUL LOCAL COMMUNITY COLLEGE 
20:22:46 RIGHT HERE IN THE AREA TO TAKE ADVANTAGE.

20:22:51 I GUESS THE BIGGER PICTURE IS, THE RESIDENTS THAT ARE HERE IN THE NEW 
20:22:54 HOUSING PROJECT, HOW LONG ARE THEY ALLOWED TO STAY?

20:22:56 IS THERE SOME LIMIT?

20:23:01 I'M NOT SURE BECAUSE THAT WASN'T KIND OF POPPING OUT IN THE PRESENTATION 
20:23:01 THERE.

20:23:03 HELP ME SHARE THAT INFORMATION.

20:23:08 >> DAN, WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO HANDLE THAT?

20:23:17 SO UNLIKE SOME HOMEKEY AND ROOM KEY WAS ALSO COVERED, THIS IS WHAT WE CALL 
20:23:25 SUPPORTIVE HOUSING, AND IT'S REALLY JUST THE SAME AS IN ANY OF YOUR 
20:23:28 RESIDENTS WHO HAVE A LEASE FOR AN APARTMENT THAT'S OWNED BY SOMEBODY 
20:23:28 ELSE.

20:23:33 THEY HAVE TO ABIDE BY THE LEASE, THEY HAVE TO PAY THE RENT.

20:23:42 THIS IS NOT TIME LIMITED, AND EACH YEAR THAT LEAD WILL GET RENEWED.

20:23:48 AS LONG AS IT'S NOT -- THAT THEY'RE WELCOME TO STAY THERE FOR AS LONG AS 
20:23:51 THEY'RE TRL THE IN BEING TENANTS ON THE  BUILDING.

20:23:56 WE DO HAVE A 97% RETENTION RATE, SO THE LIKELIHOOD IS THAT MOST OF THESE 
20:23:58 INDIVIDUALS WHO MOVE IN WILL BE THERE FOR MANY, MANY YEARS.

20:24:03 AND WHAT WE DO FIND, WE'VE DONE PROJECTS THAT HAVE BEEN  LITERALLY 
20:24:08 RIGHT NEXT TO SCHOOLS, WE HAVE A PROJECT IN L.A. IN HOLLYWOOD THAT IS 
20:24:13 NEXT DOOR TO A PRESCHOOL AND ONE BLOCK AWAY FROM AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, AND 
20:24:18 THESE PROPERTIES BECOME TRANSPARENT.

20:24:27 SHANGRI-LA DOES A GOOD JOB OF MAKING IT LOOK MORE LIKE AN APARTMENTMENT 
20:24:32 BUILDING AND ARE VERY MUCH A PART OF THE COMMUNITY.

20:24:33 >> Councilmember Cox: THAT'S FANTASTIC.

20:24:36 I JUST HAVE ONE CLARIFICATION.

20:24:40 >> Mayor Mei: I JUST WANT TO CHECK TO MAKE SURE WE NOTE THE TIMING BECAUSE 
20:24:44 OUR STENOCAPTIONER IS DUE FOR A BREAK SOON AND WE HAVE PUBLIC COMMENTS STILL.

20:24:45 >> Councilmember Cox: RIGHT.

20:24:45 THANK YOU.

20:24:52 WITH OUR CITY STAFF, HAS ANYONE GONE AND VISITED THE PROPERTIES THAT WERE 
20:24:53 DOWN IN SALINAS?

20:24:56 DID WE DO A SURVEY ON THAT, A PHYSICAL SURVEY?

20:24:58 A SITE VISIT?

20:24:59 >> Ms. Shenfil: NO, WE DID NOT.

20:25:02 WE'VE JUST HAD A CHANCE TO CHECK IN WITH SAN BERNARDINO.

20:25:08 >> Councilmember Cox: I WISH WE HAD GONE DOWN TO MAYBE CHECK OUT THE 
20:25:13 SALINAS ONE SINCE IT WAS SO CLOSE TO BE ABLE TO REPORT BACK ON THAT AS WELL.

20:25:19 >> Mayor Mei: I'M SURE IF WE  ASKED, I'M SURE THE SERVICE PROVIDER MIGHT BE 
20:25:22 ABLE TO GIVE US A PICTURE FOR REFERENCE.

20:25:29 >> Councilmember Cox: IT'S NOT THE SAME AS VISITING PHYSICALLY, JUST TO SEE IT.

20:25:34 >> Mayor Mei: WELL, IN PAST WHEN IT COMES TO THE HOUSING NAVIGATION 
20:25:38 CENTER, SUZANNE, I KNOW, THE TEAM AND MYSELF HAD GONE TO VISIT THE BERKELEY 
20:25:44 ONE AND I'M SURE THIS -- NOT THE PANDEMIC AND ALSO WITH THE BUDGET 
20:25:56 CONSTRAINTS RIGHT NOW BECAUSE OF TIMING -- RIGHT NOW WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IS 
20:25:59 SOMETHING THAT WHEN IT COMES TO THE SERVICE PROVIDERS, IT SEEMS LIKE 
20:26:04 EVERYTHING THAT WOULD BE OF INTEREST IF WE WERE TO PURSUE THAT FURTHER IF WE 
20:26:06 WERE ABLE TO FIND OUT WE GOT THE GRANTS.

20:26:11 BECAUSE I THINK THIS APPLICATION DEADLINE, CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG, DAN 
20:26:17 AND SUZANNE, IS JANUARY 31ST OR ELSE WE FOREGO THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING OF THE 
20:26:18 UNITS.

20:26:24 >> Ms. Shenfil: THAIRK.

20:26:29 >> Mayor Mei: WE COULD PROBABLY DO SOMETHING SIMULTANEOUSLY, I SEE 
20:26:34 COUNCILMEMBER KENG HAS CLARIFYING QUESTIONS BUT OUR STENOCAPTIONER IS 
20:26:36 DUE FOR A BREAK AND WE HAVE PUBLIC  SPEAKERS.

20:26:39 I WANT TO LET PEOPLE KNOW THE ONES SO FAR WE HAVE RECEIVED HAVE BEEN IN 
20:26:40 SUPPORT OF THE PROJECT.

20:26:42 SO IN CASE PEOPLE ARE WONDERING.

20:26:49 BUT I WOULD RECOMMEND -- I  KNOW -- I'M LOOKING FOR OUR CITY CLERK.

20:26:52 MS. GAUTHIER.

20:26:57 >> Ms. Gauthier: I'M HERE.

20:27:00 >> Mayor Mei: I'M TRYING TO FIND YOU ON MY SCREEN.

20:27:03 MAYBE WE TAKE A QUICK 10 MINUTE BREAK AND THEN RETURN, BECAUSE I WANT TO 
20:27:08 MAKE SURE THAT WE GIVE EVERY ONE FULL TIME AND WE ALSO ARE COMING BACK FOR 
20:27:10 CLARIFYING COMMENTS BEFORE WE MAKE OUR DECISION.

20:27:14 SO ONCE WE HEAR FROM THE QUESTIONS FROM COUNCILMEMBER KENG AND ALSO FROM THE PUBLIC.

20:27:18 SO WHY DON'T WE PAUSE FOR A 10-MINUTE BREAK IF THAT'S POSSIBLE JUST TO MAKE 
20:27:20 SURE I'M RESPECTFUL OF OUR  STENOCAPTIONER'S TIME.

20:27:22 >> Ms. Gauthier: ALL RIGHT.

20:27:23 I'LL SET A TIMER.

20:27:24 10 MINUTES.

20:27:25 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU SO MUCH.

20:27:33 AND IF YOU COULD PLEASE ALL REMEMBER TO MUTE YOURSELVES AND STOP YOUR VIDEO, 
20:27:34 THAT WOULD BE GREAT DURING THE BREAK.

20:27:35 THANK YOU.

20:29:07 [BREAK]

20:39:44 >> Mayor Mei: I SEE OUR COUNCIL IS BACK AND WE'LL RESUME WITH COUNCILMEMBER 
20:39:45 KENG.

20:39:48 WE ALSO HAVE QUITE A FEW PUBLIC SPEAKERS.

20:39:53 JUST AGAIN TO NOTE THE PUBLIC COMMENTS THAT WE'VE RECEIVED TO DATE HAVE BEEN 
20:39:55 IN SUPPORT OF THIS.

20:40:00 COUNCILMEMBER KENG, CLARIFYING QUESTIONS.

20:40:01 >> Councilmember Keng: SURE.

20:40:02 THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR.

20:40:06 SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH AGAIN TO STAFF FOR THE VERY DETAILED PRESENTATION.

20:40:13 AND I'M GLAD THAT THERE IS THIS FUNDING AVAILABLE FOR THE HOMEKEY PROGRAM THAT 
20:40:14 IS VERY MUCH NECESSARY.

20:40:16 I DO HAVE ONE QUICK QUESTION.

20:40:26 THE PREVIOUS HOMEKEY AND ROOMKEY PROGRAMS, THEY WERE FREE OF CHARGE, I 
20:40:32 BELIEVE, SO IT WAS MENTIONED THAT THERE WOULD BE RENT BEING COLLECTED AND I 
20:40:40 WANTED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S THE RANGE OF RENT AND WHAT'S THE PROCESS SET UP?

20:40:48 >> Mr. Schoenholz: THANK YOU, COUNCILMEMBER KENG.

20:40:55 I THINK IN THE PREVIOUS HOMEKEY ACTUALLY, IT WAS ALSO A PERMANENT 
20:41:00 HOUSING PROGRAM, AND SO I THINK WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A CONGREGATE 
20:41:08 SHELTER OR IN THE CASE OF THE ROOMKEY, IT WAS NON-CONGREGATE SHELTER, THERE 
20:41:11 MAY NOT HAVE BEEN RENT CHARGED, BUT WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT AFFORDABLE 
20:41:17 HOUSING, TYPICALLY THE PROJECT WILL CHARGE AN AFFORDABLE RENT TO THE 
20:41:20 TENANT.

20:41:25 MANY OF THESE TENANTS WILL HAVE SOME INCOME, ALTHOUGH IT'S VERY MINIMAL, 
20:41:32 AND TYPICALLY THEY'RE ASKED TO CONTRIBUTE NO MORE THAN 30% OF THEIR 
20:41:36 OVERALL INCOME TO PAY FOR RENT AND ASSOCIATED  COST.

20:41:40 THAT MAY BE A VERY SMALL AMOUNT AND IN SOME CASES, SOME OF THESE FOLKS MAY 
20:41:47 HAVE NO INCOME AT ALL IN WHICH CASE THEY WON'T PAY ANY RENT, BUT THE 
20:41:51 HOMEKEY PROJECT DOES ALLOW FOR AND PROVIDE FOR RENT COLLECTION FROM 10 
20:41:51 TANTS.

20:41:55  TENANTS.

20:41:58 >> Councilmember Keng: GOT IT.

20:42:05 >> Mayor Mei: NOW I'D LIKE TO GO TO THE PUBLIC SPEAKERS BECAUSE WE HAVE QUITE 
20:42:06 A FEW THIS EVENING.

20:42:15 I'M GOING TO GO WITH 2 MINUTES EACH SPEAKER, AND WE DON'T NEED TO USE THE 
20:42:21 WHOLE TIME IF YOU -- IF SOMEBODY HAS SPOKEN ON SIMILAR COMMENTS, PLEASE 
20:42:23 FEEL FREE TO SHARE THAT SUPPORT.

20:42:27 WE'LL GO WITH THE FIRST SPEAKER, WHICH I SEE IS ROBERT DAULTON.

20:42:34 >> THANK YOU, MAYOR AND COUNCILMEMBERS.

20:42:39 I'M JUST CALLING TO ADD MY VOICE IN SUPPORT FOR THE SWIFT APPROVAL OF 
20:42:43 STAFF RECOMMENDATION FOR THE APPLICATION FOR THE STATE HOMEKEY 
20:42:44 FUNDING.

20:42:48 I THINK WE ALL KNOW THE NEED FOR PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING HAS NEVER 
20:42:54 BEEN MORE CLEAR OR URGENT, AND THIS OPPORTUNITY LOOKS TO CREATE AN 
20:42:57 APPRECIABLE NUMBER OF UNITS TO HOUSE THE MOST NEEDY IN OUR COMMUNITY.

20:43:02 SO THANK YOU FOR THE STAFF FOR YOUR WORK, AND THANK YOU FOR THE COUNCIL 
20:43:04 FOR WHAT I KNOW WILL BE THE RIGHT DECISION.

20:43:08 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

20:43:11 THE NEXT SPEAKER IS MARIE H.

20:43:12 WELCOME.

20:43:15 >> HELLO.

20:43:17 THIS IS MARIE HUGHES.

20:43:22 I'M A LONG TIME RESIDENT OF FREMONT, AND A MEMBER OF FREMONT FOR EVERYONE'S 
20:43:23 LEADERSHIP TEAM.

20:43:29 I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO EXPRESS MY SUPPORT FOR ITEM 7A, THE APPLICATION FOR STATE 
20:43:30 HOMEKEY FUNDING.

20:43:36 THIS PROJECT WILL SERVE MEMBERS OF THE UNHOUSED COMMUNITY WHO REQUIRE 
20:43:41 LONG-TERM CARE DUE TO PHYSICAL AND MENTAL CHALLENGES AND ALSO THOSE WHO 
20:43:43 ARE AT RISK OF BECOMING HOMELESS WHICH I THINK IS IMPORTANT.

20:43:50 WE ARE ALL AWARE THAT FREMONT HAS A MOMENTLESS PROBLEM AND THIS HAS 
20:43:52 SKYROCKETED DURING THE PANDEMIC.

20:43:56 WE KNOW WE HAVE HUNDREDS OF  HOMELESS PEOPLE LIVING IN FREMONT BASED ON OUR 
20:43:59 LAST POINT IN TIME COUNTS AND THE LIKELY TOTAL IS MANY TIMES HIGHER, 
20:44:05 WITH MORE RESIDENTS BECOMING HOMELESS ON A REGULAR BASIS DUE TO THE PANDEMIC.

20:44:10 AN ADDITIONAL 159 ROOMS OF PERMANENT HOUSING WOULD BE A GREAT ADDITION TO 
20:44:14 OUR ARSENAL TO ADDRESS THIS PRESSING PROBLEM, AND IT WOULD ALSO GET US 
20:44:18 CLOSER TO OUR AFFORDABLE HOUSING GOALS OF WHICH WE HAVE FALLEN WOEFULLY SHORT.

20:44:24 THE CITY STANDS TO GAIN THE NET BENEFIT OF OVER 50 MILLION IF WE ACT NOW.

20:44:28 SENDING THIS ITEM BACK FOR MORE STUDY WOULD CAUSE US TO MISS THE DEADLINE 
20:44:34 FOR INCENTIVE FUNDS, WHICH COULD DERAIL THE PROJECT, AND ALSO SEEMS 
20:44:40 UNREASONABLE CONSIDERING WHAT A GREAT JOB THE STAFF DID ON THEIR 
20:44:43 PRESENTATION AND PREPARATION TO APPLY FOR THE FUNDS.

20:44:44 THANK YOU.

20:44:46 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

20:44:54 THE NEXT SPEAKER IS JANE LIN.

20:44:55 WELCOME.

20:45:01 WELCOME, JANE.

20:45:01 >> HI.

20:45:03 GOOD EVENING.

20:45:08 MY NAME IS JANE LIN, AND MY FAMILY HAVE BEEN IN FREMONT SINCE 1974.

20:45:11 I'M ALSO A MEMBER OF FREMONT FOR EVERYONE.

20:45:15 WE ARE AN EFFICACY GROUP FOR OUR UNHOUSED NEIGHBORS.

20:45:22 I, TOO, STAND IN SUPPORT FOR A VIABLE PATHWAY TO PERMANENT HOUSING LIKE 
20:45:27 PROJECT HOMEKEY BECAUSE I RESOURCED COMPASSIONATE CITY LIKE FREMONT SHOULD 
20:45:29 NOT HAVE PEOPLE SLEEPING ON THE STREETS.

20:45:37 AND IN FACT, I WANT TO TELL YOU THAT A FEW WEEKS AGO, I WAS WALKING DOWN 
20:45:42 THORNTON AVENUE NEAR FREMONT BOULEVARD WHEN A MOTORIZED SCOOTER WHIZZED BY ME 
20:45:46 AND ALSO RAN INTO WHAT FROM AFAR LOOKED LIKE A PILE OF CLOTHES, BUT WHEN I GOT 
20:45:51 CLOSER, IT WAS ACTUALLY SOMEONE UNDERNEATH A VERY THIN BLANKET, 
20:45:52 SLEEPING ON THE SIDEWALK.

20:45:55 AND THIS WAS SO UPSETTING TO ME.

20:45:57 I PLACED A CALL TO FREMONT PD.

20:46:03 THEY WERE ABLE TO HANDLE THIS ISSUE, BUT ON A COLD WINTER'S DAY, NO ONE, 
20:46:08 NOT EVEN ANIMALS, CERTAINLY NOT PEOPLE SHOULD BE OUT SLEEPING ON THE SIDEWALK.

20:46:15 SO I WOULD SINCERELY URGE THE CITY COUNCIL TO MAKE PROGRAMS LIKE PROJECT 
20:46:22 HOMEKEY AND SUPPORTIVE PERMANENT HOUSING A REALITY FOR OUR UNHOUSED 
20:46:27 FREMONT NEIGHBORS BECAUSE, AGAIN, WE REALLY SHOULD NOT HAVE PEOPLE SLEEPING 
20:46:34 OUT ON THE STREETS AND BEING HARMED BY CARELESS  SCOOTERS AND PEOPLE WHO ARE 
20:46:37 VERY DISTRACTED AND ALSO NOT ATTENTIVE.

20:46:37 THANK YOU.

20:46:40 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

20:46:49 NEXT SPEAKER IS LISA DANZ.

20:46:49 WELCOME.

20:46:50 >> HI, THANK YOU.

20:46:54 I'M A FREMONT RESIDENT IN DISTRICT 3 AND I'M A LEADER IN FREMONT FOR 
20:46:54 EVERYONE.

20:46:59 I STRONGLY URGE YOU TO SUPPORT THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION FOR THE PROJECT 
20:47:00 HOMEKEY PROJECT.

20:47:04 I'M NOT GOING TO GET INTO DETAILS BECAUSE YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD A BUNCH 
20:47:04 OF WONDERFUL REASONS.

20:47:08 I JUST URGE YOU TO DO THIS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND TO MAKE SURE THAT THE 
20:47:11 AUTHORIZATION IS FLEXIBLE ENOUGH TO MAKE SURE THAT STAFF CAN CREATE THE 
20:47:13  STRONGEST APPLICATION POSSIBLE BEFORE THE DEADLINE.

20:47:14 THANK YOU.

20:47:16 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

20:47:19 NEXT SPEAKER IS SANDRA MOORE.

20:47:20 WELCOME, SANDRA.

20:47:25 >> THANK YOU, MAYOR.

20:47:30 I'M A RESIDENT IN FREMONT SINCE 1971, GROWING UP IN FREMONT.

20:47:33 AGING IN PLACE NOW IN FREMONT.

20:47:41 I ALSO WORK WITH FREMONT FOR EVERYONE GROUP, AND I BELIEVE THAT WHAT I'VE 
20:47:48 SEEN HERE TONIGHT HAS ANSWERED MOST OF MY  QUESTIONS REGARDING THE MANAGEMENT 
20:47:53 OF THIS MOTEL SITE, AND I'M FULLY IN SUPPORT OF  THIS.

20:48:01 I URGE YOU TO ALL MAKE THE RIGHT CHOICE AND SUPPORT STAFF, GIVING THEM THE 
20:48:04 DIRECTION THAT THEY NEED AND THE RESOURCES.

20:48:09 I BELIEVE THAT WE CAN HELP ALSO PREVENT ANY FURTHER  DISPLACEMENTS FROM THIS 
20:48:14  PANDEMIC, AND WE KNOW THAT THEY WILL CONTINUE.

20:48:21 SO I URGE YOU TO SUPPORT THIS PROGRAM ON YOUR AGENDA TONIGHT.

20:48:22 THANK YOU.

20:48:25 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU, SANDRA.

20:48:30 NEXT SPEAKER, HAYES SHAIR.

20:48:31 >> GOOD EVENING, MAYOR.

20:48:33 THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND MEMBERS OF CITY COUNCIL.

20:48:36 I'M A RESIDENT OF FREMONT.

20:48:40 I'M HERE TO SUPPORT THE APPLICATION FOR STATE HOMEKEY FUNDING AND I'M NOT 
20:48:45 GOING TO HARP ON THE BENEFITS THAT WAS ALREADY VERY ELOQUENTLY  PRESENTED TO 
20:48:47 US BUT TO PUT SOMETHING INTO PERSPECTIVE.

20:48:51 I'M A MEMBER OF FREMONT FOR EVERYONE AND OVER THE YEARS OUR GROUP HAS 
20:48:53 SUPPORTED MANY EFFORTS ON BEHALF OF THE UNHOUSED.

20:48:56 WE WERE THERE AT THE HOUSING NAVIGATION CENTER, WE HOSTED FEEDINGS, 
20:49:00 DISTRIBUTION DRIVES, ORGANIZED EDUCATIONAL EVENTS AND MOST RECENTLY 
20:49:02 SUPPORTED SAFE PARKING HOST SITES.

20:49:07 WHILE WE'RE PROUD OF OUR EFFORTS AND THE ACHIEVEMENTS OF OUR CITY IT IS MY 
20:49:12 OPINION NONE OF THESE PROGRAMS COMES EVEN CLOSE TO THE IMPACT THAT 156 
20:49:16 UNITS OF PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING WOULD BRING TO THE FREMONT COMMUNITY.

20:49:20 THAT IS 27% OF OUR ENTIRE UNHOUSED POPULATION, AT LEAST BACK IN 2019.

20:49:24 SO YES, WE SHOULD CELEBRATE ALLOWING PEOPLE TO PARK ON VACANT PARKING LOTS, 
20:49:28 BUT WE SHOULD REJOICE IN THE OPPORTUNITY TO GIVE THEM A SET OF 
20:49:29 APARTMENT KEYS.

20:49:34 GOVERNOR NEWSOM RECENTLY RELEASED A SECOND ROUND OF HOMEKEY FUNDING AND WE 
20:49:37 DO NOT KNOW IF THERE WILL BE A THIRD, SO IN CONCLUSION, WE ASK FOR YOUR 
20:49:41 SUPPORT AND A SPEEDY APPROVAL TO ALLOW SUZANNE AND HER TEAM TO PURSUE AS MUCH 
20:49:45 STATE FUNDING AS WE CAN WIN GIVEN THIS INCREDIBLY TIGHT DEADLINE.

20:49:46 THANK YOU.

20:49:48 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

20:49:51 NEXT SPEAKER IS KATHRYN RUBIE.

20:49:52 WELCOME.

20:50:05 >> Ms. Gauthier: KATHERINE  RUBIE?

20:50:06 >> Mayor Mei: WELCOME.

20:50:17 >> Ms. Gauthier: JOHN, CAN YOU PLEASE RESTART THE CLOCK?

20:50:21 KATHERINE, PLEASE UNMUTE.

20:50:25 >> Mayor Mei: SHE'S UNMUTED BUT I DON'T HEAR HER AT THIS MOMENT.

20:50:26 OKAY.

20:50:29 WHY DON'T WE COME BACK TO HER.

20:50:30 BLAIR BEEKMAN.

20:50:35 >> HI.

20:50:36 BLAIR BEEKMAN HERE.

20:50:43 THANKS A LOT FOR THIS ITEM, AND JUST THE LEARNING PROCESS ABOUT IT, IT WAS 
20:50:44 INTERESTING.

20:50:44 THANK YOU.

20:50:51 IT INTERESTING TO LEARN THAT IN FIVE YEARS' TIME, I WANT THESE HOMEKEY 
20:50:55 IDEAS TO BECOME MORE STABLE AFFORDABLE HOUSING IDEAS.

20:50:55 THANK YOU FOR THAT.

20:51:07 I KNOW IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY, IN SAN JOSÉ, THERE WAS A PAST THAT FOR 
20:51:11 HOMELESS PEOPLE IN, SAY, MOUNTAIN VIEW, THEY WOULD OFTEN SEND THEM TO SAN JOSÉ 
20:51:18 IN ORDER TO SEEK SERVICES, AND WITH ALL THE NEW STATE AND FEDERAL SUBSIDY 
20:51:24 FUNDING AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME, THEY'RE ABLE TO MORE DEVELOP HOMELESS PROGRAMS 
20:51:28 WITHIN EACH CITY OF SANTA CLARA COUNTY NOW, WHICH IS AN INTERESTING CONCEPT.

20:51:34 I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU CAN DO WITH THAT HERE IN ALAMEDA COUNTY, BUT MAYBE 
20:51:36 HOPEFULLY IT CAN BE A GOOD REFERENCE POINT FOR YOURSELVES.

20:51:43 THE IDEA OF STATE AND FEDERAL SUBSIDIES IS KIND OF AMAZING RIGHT NOW IN WHAT 
20:51:44 IT CAN HELP US WITH.

20:51:51 I HOPE WE'RE ALL GRATEFUL FOR IT, I GUESS IS THE TERM, AND RESPECTFUL, AND 
20:51:52 CAN TREAT IT WELL.

20:51:58 AND IT CAN DO IMPORTANT WORK FOR OURSELVES, THE IDEA OF  SUBSIDIES.

20:52:04 I HOPE WE CAN ALL JUST TALK OPENLY ABOUT WHAT SUBSIDIES ARE DOING AT THIS 
20:52:04 TIME.

20:52:10 AND A THANK YOU AS ALWAYS TO -- AS GREAT AS THIS PROJECT CAN BE, IT'S OUR 
20:52:16 TRADITIONAL GOOD PRACTICES OF HOMELESS  PROVIDERSHIP THAT I HOPE YOU CAN 
20:52:20 CONTINUE AND THE SUBSIDIES CAN REALLY HELP WITH A LOT AT THIS TIME AS WELL 
20:52:22 IN FREMONT AND BAY AREA CITIES.

20:52:26 GOOD LUCK IN YOUR ESTABLISHED GOOD PRACTICES OF HOMELESS  ISSUES FOR ALL 
20:52:26 OF US.

20:52:27 THANK YOU.

20:52:44 >> Mayor Mei: OKAY, NEXT SPEAKER IS KATHERINE RUBIE IF SHE'S STILL THERE?

20:52:47 >> ALL RIGHT.

20:52:49 CAN YOU HEAR ME THIS TIME?

20:52:51 >> Mayor Mei: YES.

20:52:53 >> THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME.

20:53:00 I AM A RESIDENT OF NEWARK NOW, AS WELL AS A LEADER FOR -- OF FREMONT FOR EVERYONE.

20:53:06 AND A MEMBER OF MISSION PEAK UNITARIAN UNIVERSALIST CONGREGATION.

20:53:09 I AM DEEPLY INTERESTED IN WHAT HAPPENS IN FREMONT SINCE MUCH OF MY LIFE'S 
20:53:13 ACTIVITIES TAKE PLACE THERE, SUCH AS SEEING MY MEDICAL PROVIDERS, WORKING 
20:53:15 AND GOING TO CHURCH.

20:53:20 IN ADDITION, WHAT HAPPENS IN FREMONT IS VERY RELEVANT TO NEWARK SINCE NEWARK 
20:53:25 IS COMPLETELY SURROUNDED BY  FREMONT, AND BECAUSE OF OUR CLOSE PROXIMITY AND 
20:53:31 ASSOCIATION, I AM IN SUPPORT OF THE AGENDA ITEM REGARDING THE PURCHASE OF 
20:53:35 MOTEL 6, AND ANY OTHER SUITABLE CHOICE OR ALTERNATIVE THAT MIGHT COME UP IN 
20:53:36 THE FUTURE.

20:53:41 THE SUBJECT OF HOMELESSNESS HAS AFFECTED ME PERSONALLY, AND, 
20:53:45 THEREFORE, I HAVE A VERY STRONG COMMITMENT TOWARDS DOING ALL WE CAN TO 
20:53:49 PREVENT IT FROM HAPPENING IN THE FIRST PLACE, AND TO GET PEOPLE HOUSED EVEN 
20:53:52 WHEN THEY DO FALL INTO HOMELESSNESS.

20:53:57 I WOULD LIKE TO -- BY THE WAY, I'M READING AN EMAIL THAT I SENT THAT 
20:54:01 APPARENTLY YOU GUYS DID NOT GET IN TIME FOR MEETING, SO I APOLOGIZE IF THIS 
20:54:02 SOUNDS READ.

20:54:03 BECAUSE IT IS.

20:54:09 THIS IS MY FIRST EXPERIENCE  WITH -- THIS IS NOT MY FIRST EXPERIENCE WITH 
20:54:11 TALKING TO YOU ABOUT MATTERS AROUND  HOMELESSNESS.

20:54:16 I DID TALK TO YOU ABOUT THE HNC AND I'M GRATEFUL FOR YOUR SUPPORT WITH THAT.

20:54:24 I FELL INTO HOMELESSNESS ALONG WITH MY SPOUSE IN 2019, AND IT WAS A 
20:54:27 DEVASTATING EXPERIENCE FOR BOTH OF US.

20:54:35 AND THOUGH WE DID NOT HAVE IT AS BAD AS MOST PEOPLE, WE DID HAVE HAVING A BAD 
20:54:37 ENOUGH TIME THAT IT WAS VERY STRESSFUL.

20:54:43 I'M SEEING HOMELESS PEOPLE IN EMACIATED CONDITION, WITH HEAD INJURY, PEOPLE 
20:54:47 GOING THROUGH GARBAGE FOR SOMETHING TO EAT BUT THE MOST HEARTBREAKING FOR ME 
20:54:53 IS WHEN I ASKED A CRYING HOMELESS WOMAN IF THERE WAS SOMETHING I COULD DO TO 
20:54:55 HELP AND ALL SHE WANTED WAS WATER.

20:54:57 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU FOR THE COMMENTS BY I ALSO WANTED TO LET YOU 
20:55:03 KNOW I KNOW THE LETTER WENT OUT, KATHERINE, SO THANK YOU SO MUCH, I 
20:55:04 READ IT EARLIER.

20:55:04 >> THANK YOU.

20:55:05 I APPRECIATE THAT.

20:55:08 >> Mayor Mei: I WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW IT DID COME OUT, JUST TO CLARIFY.

20:55:09 THANK YOU.

20:55:13 NEXT SPEAKER IS DARLENE  CRITTENDON.

20:55:17 I APOLOGIZE IF I DIDN'T PRONOUNCE THAT CORRECTLY.

20:55:19 IF YOU COULD UNMUTE, DARLENE?

20:55:19 THANK YOU.

20:55:28 >> MADAME MAYOR, I COULDN'T PRONOUNCE IT WHEN I MET HIM EITHER.

20:55:32 THANK YOU, MAYOR, AND FREMONT CITY COUNCIL FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK.

20:55:36 I AM AN ADVOCATE FOR THE UNHOUSED HERE IN FREMONT.

20:55:41 MOST OF MY VOLUNTEERING IS THROUGH ABODE AND COMPASSION NETWORK.

20:55:46 I'M WRITING TO EXPRESS MY SUPPORT FOR THE APPLICATION FOR STATE HOMEKEY 
20:55:50 FUNDING ITEM 7A BECAUSE PERMANENT HOUSING IS THE ONLY SYSTEMATIC 
20:55:51 SOLUTION FOR HOMELESSNESS.

20:55:55 MY REASON FOR SUPPORTING THIS ITEM ARE THE SAME AS ALL THE PEOPLE THAT SPOKE 
20:56:01 EARLIER, INCLUDING THE FACT THAT IT WOULD CLEAN UP FREMONT STREETS, AND 
20:56:04 HELP WITH OUR SAFETY AND SECURITY HERE IN FREMONT.

20:56:10 IMPROVING THE LOOK OF OUR PARKS AND OUR STREETS.

20:56:15 HIERARCHY OF NEEDS SPEAKS OF IT BEING VERY IMPORTANT THAT PEOPLE HAVE THEIR 
20:56:19 BASIC NEEDS MET:  FOOD, SHELTER, CLOTHING, BEFORE WE CAN EXPECT THEM TO 
20:56:23 WORRY OR CARE ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE:  A  JOB, TAKING CARE OF THEIR HEALTH, 
20:56:28 MAKING FRIENDSHIPS, SELF-ESTEEM, HAVING A SENSE OF CONNECTION.

20:56:32 NORN OF THAT STUFF MATTERS IF A PERSON IS NOT HOUSED AND CAN FEEL SAFE IN 
20:56:33 THEIR OWN HOUSING.

20:56:36 I BELIEVE THAT WE MUST ACT TO HELP SOLVE THIS PROBLEM.

20:56:44 IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT OUR CITY WOULD GAIN A NET BENEFIT OF 40 MILLION 
20:56:50 -- IN EXCESS OF $40 MILLION WITH AN ADDED $1.5 MILLION INCENTIVE BONUS IF 
20:56:51 WE ACT BEFORE JANUARY 31ST.

20:56:59 I LOVE THE IDEA OF USING THIS MOTEL 6 SITE BECAUSE IT WOULD ADD 156 
20:57:01 PERMANENT RESIDENCES.

20:57:02 THAT WOULD BE AWESOME.

20:57:07 AS A FREMONT RESIDENT, I WOULD BE PROUD TO SAY THAT MY CITY DID THIS FOR OUR 
20:57:08 UNHOUSED NEIGHBORS.

20:57:14 I AM ASKING YOU TO PROVIDE STAFF THE OPPORTUNITY TO PURSUE THIS APPLICATION 
20:57:16 FOR STATE HOMEKEY FUNDING IMMEDIATELY.

20:57:19 I KNOW THAT IT IS GOING TO BE A LOT OF WORK.

20:57:20 OH, MY TIME IS UP.

20:57:22 OH, MY GOSH.

20:57:33 >> Mayor Mei: OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS VERNITA VERMA.

20:57:36 WELCOME, VINITA.

20:57:36 >> THANK YOU, MAYOR.

20:57:40 GOOD EVENING, COUNCILMEMBERS, MAYOR, AND CITY STAFF.

20:57:49 AS A PART OF THE LEADERSHIP TEAM OF FREMONT FOR EVERYONE AND A LONG TIME 
20:57:55 FREMONT RESIDENT, I WELCOME THIS CITY'S EFFORT TO PARTICIPATE IN THE HOMEKEY 
20:57:55 PROJECT.

20:58:01 THIS IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO HELP OUR FELLOW RESIDENT.

20:58:07 AS AN INDIVIDUAL, I HAVE ALWAYS ADVOCATING FOR PROJECTS FOR  HOMELESS 
20:58:07 INTERVENTION.

20:58:10 MORE SO FOR OUR FAMILIES THAN ANYONE ELSE.

20:58:20 THIS PROJECT IS PLANNED TO BE RESTRICTIVE FOR INDIVIDUALS -- 
20:58:25 HOWEVER, WE NEED TO REMEMBER WE HAVE AROUND 6,000 PLUS STUDENT CHILDREN IN 
20:58:27 FREMONT UNIFIED WHO ARE IN UNSTABLE HOUSING SITUATION.

20:58:34 THIS INFORMATION ONLY CALLS FOR MORE HOUSING FOR FAMILIES IN VULNERABLE 
20:58:34 SITUATION.

20:58:39 I SUPPORT THIS PROJECT AND REQUEST CITY TO WORK ON MORE SUPPORT FOR OUR 
20:58:40 FAMILIES AS  WELL.

20:58:45 AND I DO AGREE WITH EACH AND EVERY SPEAKER WHO HAS SPOKEN BEFORE ME.

20:58:48 THEIR POINTS ARE RIGHT ON SPOT.

20:58:56 I HOPE AS A GROUP WE UNDERSTAND THAT THESE ARE NOT THE RESIDENTS WHO WE 
20:59:00 DON'T WANT IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD, WE WANT THEM MORE, WE WANT TO HELP THEM, WE 
20:59:03 DON'T WANT THEM ON OUR STREETS.

20:59:04 WE WANT THEM IN THEIR HOMES.

20:59:11 THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

20:59:12 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

20:59:13 THE NEXT SPEAKER IS ANNIE.

20:59:14 WELCOME, ANNIE.

20:59:16 >> THANK YOU.

20:59:21 AS A FREMONT RESIDENT FOR OVER A DECADE AND A LEADER IN FREMONT FOR EVERYONE, 
20:59:23 I SUPPORT THIS ITEM.

20:59:28 I KNOW THAT HOMELESSNESS IS WORSENING IN OUR COMMUNITY, AND RIGHT NOW WE 
20:59:34 HAVE A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO USE OVER $40 MILLION OF STATE FUNDS TO BUILD 
20:59:35 PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING IF WE ACT QUICKLY.

20:59:41 I'M REALLY CONCERNED WITH THE GROWING HOMELESS POPULATION, BUT I UNDERSTAND 
20:59:46 THAT SYSTEMIC SOLUTIONS THAT ADDRESS THE ROOT CAUSES OF THIS HOMELESSNESS 
20:59:51 ARE NEEDED TO FIX THE CRISIS, WE CAN'T JUST SHOVE IT UNDER THE RUG LIME SOME 
20:59:53 OTHER COMMUNITIES THAT AREN'T AS PROGRESSIVE AS US ARE DOING.

20:59:58 SO I SUPPORT THE PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING THAT WILL KEEP MORE OF OUR 
21:00:04 NEIGHBORS OFF THE STREETS LONG TERM, WHICH IS UNDOUBTEDLY GOOD FOR THOSE 
21:00:09 COMMUNITY MEMBERS BUT IT IS ALSO GOOD FOR OUR COMMUNITIES AS THERE WILL BE 
21:00:10 LESS UNHOUSED PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITIES.

21:00:14 BUT I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT, AND I HATE TO MAKE THE 
21:00:17 ARGUMENT THAT WE SHOULD DO GOOD THINGS BECAUSE IT SAVES MONEY, ABOUT YOU THIS 
21:00:26  BUT THIS TIME IT IS GOING TO SAVE MONEY.

21:00:36 PER PERSON -- AND A 2017 STUDY OF SUPPORTIVE HOUSING IN L.A. COUNTY 
21:00:41 FOUND THAT IT RESULTED IN NET COST SAVINGS OF $20 -- OR 20%.

21:00:43 I'M MORE THAN HAPPY TO SHARE THIS DATA.

21:00:49 SO THIS PROGRAM IS GOING TO BE GOOD FOR CURRENTLY UNHOUSED PEOPLE AS WELL AS 
21:00:53 THE CITY, WHICH GETS STATE FUNDS FOR A PROGRAM THAT'S GOING TO SAVE THE CITY 
21:00:54 MONEY.

21:00:57 THAT SEEMS LIKE A PRETTY GOOD DEAL TO ME.

21:01:02 SO I URGE COUNCIL TO SUPPORT THIS ITEM AND TO MAK SURE THE FUNDING 
21:01:05 APPLICATION HAS BROUGHT ENOUGH TO BE DIRECTED TOWARDS PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE 
21:01:11 HOUSING, EITHER AT MOTEL SIX OR AT AN ALTERNATIVE SITE JUST IN CASE.

21:01:11 THANK YOU.

21:01:17 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

21:01:25 AND I'LL TURN THIS BACK OVER, I ALSO HAVE SOME COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS.

21:01:29 CAN WE NOT SHARE THE TIMER NOW?

21:01:30 APOLOGIES.

21:01:30 THANK YOU.

21:01:36 SO COUNCILMEMBER JONES, YOU HAVE CLARIFYING QUESTIONS?

21:01:42 I HAVE THEM AT THIS TIME TOO BUT WHY DON'T YOU GO FIRST AND I'LL ASK MY 
21:01:44 CLARIFYING QUESTIONS AFTER YOU.

21:01:47 >> Councilmember Jones: I ACTUALLY THOUGHT WE WERE THROUGH WITH 
21:01:48 CLARIFYING QUESTIONS SO I JUST HAVE COMMENTS.

21:01:54 SO I JUST WANTED TO THANK THE STAFF AND SHANGRI-LA AND STEP UP FOR THE 
21:01:58 DETAILED PRESENTATION, ESPECIALLY ALL OF OUR STAFF THAT HAS WORKED SO HARD 
21:02:02 TO MAKE THIS PROJECT A REALITY BASED ON OUR APPROVAL.

21:02:06 THIS IS AN AMAZING OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE MUCH NEEDED SERVICES TO OUR 
21:02:12 UNHOUSED POPULATION AND TO LEVERAGE THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF FUNDING AVAILABLE, 
21:02:16 AND THEREFORE I'LL BE HAPPY TO MAKE A MOTION TO MOVE FORWARD WITH STAFF 
21:02:17 RECOMMENDATION AFTER HEARING FROM OUR FELLOW COUNCILMEMBERS.

21:02:18 THANK YOU.

21:02:19 >> Councilmember Cox: SECOND.

21:02:23 >> Mayor Mei: WE HAVEN'T -- I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR FROM MY FELLOW 
21:02:24 COUNCILMEMBERS.

21:02:30 NEXT IS COUNCILMEMBER YANG SHAO, I DON'T THINK YOU'VE HAD A CHANCE TO ASK 
21:02:31 QUESTIONS OR CLARIFY ANYTHING YET.

21:02:32 >> Councilmember Shao: RIGHT.

21:02:33 I DON'T HAVE ANY CLARIFYING QUESTIONS.

21:02:35 THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR.

21:02:39 I JUST WANT TO COMMENT ON THIS ITEM.

21:02:48 I'M GLAD THAT THREE YEARS AGO, WE APPROVED THE HOUSING NAVIGATION CENTER 
21:02:53 AT LEAST IN TERMS OF HELPING OUR LOCAL UNHOUSED COMMUNITY.

21:03:05 WE HAVE ACCUMULATED EXPERIENCES, ESPECIALLY IN MANAGING THE  SITES, -- 
21:03:09 THE TENANTS AND  HELPING THEM BY COLLABORATING WITH MANY OTHER 
21:03:10 ORGANIZATIONS.

21:03:18 I HOPE THAT IF WE SUCCESSFULLY GET THE GRANT AND THEN GET THIS PROJECT 
21:03:26 RUNNING, WE CAN USE THE PRECIOUS EXPERIENCE WE ALREADY HAVE ON THIS 
21:03:26 PROJECT.

21:03:32 HAVING SAID THAT, I JUST WANT TO EMPHASIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE MENTAL 
21:03:34 HEALTH OF OUR FUTURE TENANTS.

21:03:47 BECAUSE WE HAVE HEARD THAT WE JUST LOST A FORMER STUDENT OF FREMONT, MICHELE, 
21:03:50 IN A TRAGIC INCIDENT IN NEW YORK CITY.

21:04:00 AND I HOPE THAT WITH THIS PROJECT, WELL MANAGED, WE CANNOT ONLY PROVIDE 
21:04:06 PHYSICAL HELP TO OUR TENANTS, FINANCIAL HELP TO OUR TENANTS, BUT ALSO TIMELY 
21:04:08 SERVICE TO THEIR MENTAL HEALTH.

21:04:11 I'M SUPPORTIVE TO THIS PROJECT.

21:04:15 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU, COUNCILMEMBER SHAO.

21:04:20 I WAS GOING TO END TONIGHT IN HONOR OF OUR LOST COMMUNITY MEMBER.

21:04:23 BUT I WILL CONTINUE WITH THE CLARIFYING QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS.

21:04:26 I HAVE SOME CLARIFYING QUESTIONS IF NO ONE ELSE DOES.

21:04:30 I KNOW VICE MAYOR SALWAN, TO YOU HAVE CLARIFYING QUESTIONS?

21:04:32 I WAS GOING TO ASK MINE.

21:04:38 I JUST WANTED TO ASK REAL QUICK, COUNCILMEMBER JONES, DO HAVE -- YOU 
21:04:39 ALREADY MADE THE MOTION.

21:04:40 OKAY.

21:04:41 I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE.

21:04:45 I'M GOING TO ASK A COUPLE CLARIFYING QUESTIONS.

21:04:48 I KNOW THERE WERE SOME COMMENTS FROM THE PUBLIC AND I JUST WANTED TO NOTE 
21:04:51 THAT THE ALAMEDA COUNTY MAYORS HAVE BEEN HAVING A HOMELESS WORKING GROUP 
21:04:57 THAT HAS BEEN WORKING WITH PARTNERSHIP WITH THE MAYORS THEMSELVES AND WITH -- 
21:05:02 ALSO WITH OUR STAFF FOR MANY, MANY MONTHS NOW, OVER A YEAR AND PLUS NOW, 
21:05:08 AND SO WE ARE WORKING ON A HOMELESSNESS WORKING GROUP AND I WANTED TO LET 
21:05:11 PEOPLE KNOW IN THE PUBLIC THAT WE HAVE BEEN FOCUSED ON THAT, BUT I WANTED TO 
21:05:15 ASK STAFF, WILL WE BE GETTING A PRESENTATION, WHICH I THINK WE WERE 
21:05:20 SCHEDULING, TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND THE FRAMEWORK AROUND THAT.

21:05:22 BECAUSE THIS IS PART OF THE OVERALL FRAMEWORK.

21:05:24 SUZANNE, WOULD YOU LIKE TO ANSWER THAT?

21:05:31 >> Ms. Shenfil: YES, WE WILL BE GETTING A PRESENTATION, THE FINAL DOCUMENT HAS 
21:05:37 NOT YET BEEN PRESENTED TO THE BOARD OF SUPS AND THE MAYORS, BUT ABSOLUTELY, 
21:05:41 THERE WILL BE AN OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT IT HERE IN FREMONT AND TO HAVE THE 
21:05:42 PUBLIC WEIGH IN.

21:05:48 >> SO I WANTED TO JUST CLARIFY THAT TO THE PUBLIC IF THEY WERE WONDERING, AS 
21:05:57 WELL AS PART OF MEASURE W, AS PART OF OTHER  AREAS, WE ARE LOOKING ON, AND 
21:06:04 WILL WE BE DOING ANY TRAINING, WHICH IS NOW RESCHEDULED TO FEBRUARY 23RD.

21:06:11 I THINK THERE WERE SOME  QUESTIONS PROVIDED ALONG WITH ANSWERS, SO CAN 
21:06:12 LOOK AT THOSE?

21:06:16 >> Ms. Shenfil: LAURIE FLORES, OUR HOMELESS MANAGER, HAS BEEN WORKING ON 
21:06:16 THE POINT IN TIME COUNT.

21:06:23 A LOT OF THE TRAINING VIRTUAL THIS TIME AROUND RATHER THAN IN PERSON, BUT TO 
21:06:28 GET IN TOUCH WITH OUR HOME FLES MANAGER, AND SHE HAS ALL THE LINKS TO 
21:06:30 GET TO THE TRAINING.

21:06:36 >> Mayor Mei: YES, AND IF ANYONE WOULD LIKE TO JOIN US, I THINK WE KICK OFF 
21:06:38 LIKE LAST TIME AROUND 5:00 A.M.

21:06:39 >> BRIGHT AND EARLY.

21:06:45 >> IT'S A GREAT WAY TO GET TO KNOW YOUR OWN DISTRICTS AND TO GET TO KNOW YOUR 
21:06:45 COMMUNITY MEMBERS.

21:06:48 OTHER THINGS I'M TRYING TO THINK ABOUT FOR CLARIFYING QUESTIONS.

21:06:49 I THINK THAT'S ABOUT IT.

21:06:54 DO WE HAVE ANY OTHER -- SO I GUESS WE WILL ALSO BE  DEBRIEFING, AND I WOULD 
21:07:02 ASK THAT ANY OF THE MEMBERS HERE TODAY, SINCE THIS WILL BE COMING UP, BOARD OF 
21:07:08 SUPERVISORS, AS WELL AS TO MY FELLOW MAYORS, WE HAVE  A -- I'D LIKE TO ASK 
21:07:13 THAT IF YOU HAVE INTEREST IN EXPRESSING ALL YOUR FEEDBACK AND SUPPORT, PLEASE 
21:07:15 ALSO FEEL FREE TO DO SO WITH THE BOARD OF SUPS.

21:07:19 ARE THERE ANY OTHER CLARIFYING QUESTIONS?

21:07:22 I WAS GOING TO MAKE SOME OTHER COMMENTS, WE HAVE SOME COMMENTS FROM 
21:07:23 OUR COUNCILMEMBERS.

21:07:25 VICE MAYOR SALWAN, DID YOU HAVE COMMENTS AT THIS TIME?

21:07:28 BECAUSE I HAVE SOME COMMENTS AFTER YOU'RE DONE, BEFORE WE VOTE.

21:07:31 >> Councilmember Cox: I DID HAVE A CLARIFYING QUESTION.

21:07:33 >> Mayor Mei: OKAY.

21:07:36 COUNCILMEMBER COX, CLARIFYING QUESTION.

21:07:43 >> Councilmember Cox: I WAS WONDERING, I KNOW THAT -- OF SANTA CLARA HAS 
21:07:48 PROVIDED LAUNDRY SERVICES FOR THE HOMELESS, AND I WAS WONDERING, WITH 
21:07:54 YOUR -- WITH THIS NULL AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECT BASED AND MOTEL 6, 
21:08:00 WOULD THERE BE OPPORTUNITIES FOR WANDERING SERVICES BEING  PROVIDED?

21:08:05 THERE AS PART OF THE GRANT, OR IS THAT SOMETHING ELSE THAT OTHERS ARE SEEKING 
21:08:07 TO FIND ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR?

21:08:13 >> Mr. Schoenholz: TOD, DO YOU MIND FIELDING THAT ONE?

21:08:13 >> SURE.

21:08:19 SO FOR ANY NORMAL -- ON SITE FOR TENANTS TO USE.

21:08:23 SO THIS IS CONVERSION, IF I UNDERSTAND YOUR QUESTION, COUNCILWOMAN, THIS IS 
21:08:27 CONVERSION FROM SORT OF A MOTEL OPERATION TO A RESIDENTIAL OPERATION.

21:08:32 SO THAT'S PART OF WHAT WE'LL BE TRAINING THE TENANTS ON, IS  DOING 
21:08:32 THEIR OWN LAUNDRY.

21:08:37 FOR THEIR OWN LINENS AND THE THINGS THAT THEY USE.

21:08:39 AND DOING THAT ON A REGULAR BASIS.

21:08:43 SO THERE WON'T BE ANYTHING INSTITUTIONAL GOING ON FOR ALL THE 
21:08:44 TENANTS FROM A LAUNDRY PRER SPECULATIVE.

21:08:50  LAUNDRY PERSPECTIVE.

21:08:51 >> Councilmember Cox: GOTCHA.

21:08:59 I KNOW EACH COUNTY AND DIFFERENT CITIES HAVE DIFFERENT OFFERINGS TO HELP THOSE 
21:09:01 THAT ARE IN TRANSITION OR LIVING THERE, PERIOD.

21:09:05 SO JUST WANTED TO ASK THAT AS A CLARIFICATION.

21:09:09 >> THAT'S ONE OF THE KEY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN A SHELL TERL OR INTERIM 
21:09:11 HOUSING SITUATION.

21:09:16 ONCE SOMEBODY HAS THEIR OWN APARTMENT, THEIR OWN LEASE, THEY'RE PAYING THEIR 
21:09:20 RENT, THEY LIKELY ALL TRAINED OUR KID.

21:09:24 IT ABOUT LEARNING THOSE DAY TO DAY THINGS THAT HELP YOU MAINTAIN YOUR 
21:09:24 APARTMENT.

21:09:27 >> GOT IT.

21:09:32 AND THEN THAT ALSO WILL LEAD TO TEACHING ABOUT COOKING AND HEALTHY 
21:09:36 PEEL PLANNING AND THINGS LIKE THAT, THAT WOULD GO INTO THAT TYPE OF 
21:09:38 TRAINING AS WELL, CORRECT?

21:09:42 >> YEAH, AND OUR STAFF OFTEN WILL DO ONE TO ONE IN THE APARTMENT, GO OUT 
21:09:48 MAYBE, TAKE THE INDIVIDUAL OUT TO SHOP, DO A BUDGET FOR YOUR MEALS FOR THE 
21:09:53 WEEK MAYBE, GO OUT AND SHOP FOR THE VARIOUS ITEMS, COME BACK AND ACTUALLY 
21:10:00 COOK A MEAL WITH THE TENANT, GIVING VERY SPECIFIC INSTRUCTION, BECAUSE 
21:10:04 WHEN YOU'VE BEEN LIVING OUT IN THE STREET, YOU NEVER REALLY HAD TO COOK A 
21:10:09 MEAL, AND THERE'S A BIG LEARNING CURVE WITH A LOT OF THESE BASIC THINGS THAT 
21:10:19 WHEN YOU'RE IN A -- ENVIRONMENT, SO THERE'S A LOT OF HAND HOLDING IN THE 
21:10:24 BEGINNING, HELPED THEM RELEARN FOR THE FIRST TIME SOME OF THOSE BASIC LIVING 
21:10:24 SKILLS.

21:10:27 >> Councilmember Cox: THANK YOU.

21:10:30 THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ASKING -- I MEAN FOR ANSWERING MY  QUESTION.

21:10:35 AND THAT TAKES CARE OF MY CLARIFYING QUESTIONS, AND I WILL THEN WAIT TO 
21:10:36 MAKE MY COMMENTS AS WELL.

21:10:41 ALONG WITH WHOEVER ELSE WAS IN LINE THERE.

21:10:45 >> Mayor Mei: COUNCILMEMBER  KENG, DO YOU HAVE A CLARIFYING QUESTION?

21:10:48 >> Councilmember Keng: NO, JUST COMMENTS.

21:10:48 >> Mayor Mei: OKAY.

21:10:55 SO DO YOU WANT TO SHARE YOUR COMMENT AND I'LL GO BACK TO COUNCILMEMBER COX, 
21:10:57 SO GO AHEAD, COUNCILMEMBER KENG.

21:10:58 >> Councilmember Keng: SURE.

21:11:03 SO AS YOU KNOW HOMELESSNESS HAS EXACERBATED OVER THE PANDEMIC AND 
21:11:09 ESPECIALLY THE PEOPLE -- LOWER INCOME INDIVIDUALS RIM PACTED MUCH MORE THAN 
21:11:11 PEOPLE WHO CAN WORK FROM HOME.

21:11:17 SO I HAVE BEEN VERY APPRECIATIVE OF THE ROOMKEY AND THE HOMEKEY PROGRAMS THAT 
21:11:22 WERE PUT IN PLACE VERY SHORTLY AFTER THE PANDEMIC STARTED, I BELIEVE HAVING 
21:11:28 INDIVIDUAL ROOMS WILL AID IN UNHOUSED INDIVIDUALS STILL REPAIRING THEIR 
21:11:34 PHYSICIAN CANNED ALE MENTAL HEALTH.

21:11:40  -- GRANT IN TIME AND GETTING THAT MUCH NEEDED FUNDING AND RESOURCE TO FUND 
21:11:43 THIS MOTEL 6 SITE.

21:11:45 THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

21:11:48 >> THANK YOU.

21:11:53 COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME?

21:11:54 >> Vice Mayor Salwan: YES, MADAME MAYOR.

21:11:59 WE DO HAVE A HOMELESS EPIDEMIC AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS, AND WE DO 
21:12:05 HAVE OUR HOMELESS LIVING ON THE STREETS WITHOUT BASIC ACCESS TO HOUSING AND 
21:12:07 ALL OF THE OTHER NEEDS THAT COME WITH IT.

21:12:14 SO THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS WE CAN DO AT CITY LEADERS, IS 
21:12:15  -- THIS ISSUE.

21:12:25 SO I, TOO, WOULD BE SUPPORTING THIS, AND I HOPE THAT THE MAKING SURE WE 
21:12:30 HAVE A VERY ROBUST AND VERY SUCCESSFUL PRANL.

21:12:36  SUCCESSFUL FREEDOM.

21:12:43 BART STATION, THE ENCAMPMENTS THERE, WE CAN IMPROVE THOSE  AREAS, GET THOSE 
21:12:51 PEOPLE OFF THE SIDEWALKS, INTO THE STREETS, AND I ALSO LIKE THAT WE'RE 
21:12:54 CHIPPING AWAS AT OUR RHNA NUMBERS.

21:13:03 THANK YOU SO MUCH, APPRECIATE STAFF'S WORK.

21:13:06 >>

21:13:10 >> Councilmember Cox: THIS PROJECT, THE HOMEKEY IS A  WIN-WIN, I THINK, FOR 
21:13:10 EVERYONE.

21:13:15 FOR OUR COMMUNITY, FOR THE RESIDENTS, FOR THE ORGANIZATIONS BEING BROUGHT 
21:13:22 TOGETHER AND I REALLY WANT TO THANK ALL THOSE INVOLVED, THE CITY STAFF, ALL OF 
21:13:31 THE PARTNERS, ON FINDING SOLUTIONS AND FINDING FUNDING TO HELP US ON THIS 
21:13:40 HOMELESS CRISIS THAT IS HAPPENING BUT ALSO THERE LOOK TO PROVIDE AFFORDABLE 
21:13:44 HOUSING THAT SO MUCH DESERVE TO BE HOUSED.

21:13:55 I BELIEVE THIS HOMEKEY PROJECT WILL TACKLE SOCIAL INEQUALITIES AND HOUSING 
21:13:56 INEQUALITIES.

21:14:02 ON THE EVE THAT WE JUST CELEBRATED DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING'S ADVOCACY, THAT 
21:14:07 WAS A BIG ADVOCATE FOR SOCIAL INEQUALITIES THAT WE'VE ALSO GOT TO 
21:14:11 THANK DR. KING FOR PUTTING PRESSURE WITH PRESIDENT LINDEN JOHNSON AND 
21:14:15 CONGRESS TO BE ABLE TO PASS FAIR HOUSING, AND IT WAS JUST HOUSING TO 
21:14:21 GIVE EVERYONE TO LIVE THE AMERICAN DREAM, AND ALSO BY SUPPORTING THIS 
21:14:27 HOMEKEY PROJECT, WE WILL HELP AND HELPING TO CARRY OUT THE DREAM THAT 
21:14:31  DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING HAD  DREAMED THAT EVERYONE DOES DESERVE TO HAVE 
21:14:31 HOUSING.

21:14:33 IT'S A DREAM FOR ALL PEOPLE.

21:14:39 AND SO I WILL SUPPORT THIS PROJECT, AND IT'S IN THE INITIATIVES OF WHAT WE 
21:14:44 WANT TO DO THAT IS -- THE TIME IS RIGHT TO DO THE RIGHT THING, AND THE BEST 
21:14:48 WAY IS BY SERVING OUR COMMUNITY WITH RACE AND LOVE.

21:14:48 THANK YOU.

21:14:54 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

21:14:59 I DEFINITELY CONQUER ON MANY OF THE COMMENTS SHARED BY MY COUNCILMEMBERS 
21:14:59 THIS EVENING.

21:15:04 EARLIER THIS EVENING I GATHERED WITH SOME OF MY FELLOW MAYORS IN PARTICULAR 
21:15:08 FOCUSING ON THE DISCUSSION OF EQUITY IN THE COMMUNITIES, AND ONE OF THE THINGS 
21:15:10 THAT WE DID FOCUS ON IS ON HOUSING.

21:15:17 I ALSO WANTED PEOPLE TO KNOW THAT AS MAYOR, I'VE ALSO PARTICIPATED IN -- 
21:15:21 FOR U.S. HOUSING INVESTMENT POLICY PLATFORM, AND THAT IS FOCUSING ON 
21:15:27 THINGS LIKE MAKING SECTION 8 HOUSING CHOICE VOUCHERS AVAILABLE TO ELIGIBLE 
21:15:33  HOUSEHOLDS, SUPPORT OF CONTINUUM OF CARE FOR HOMELESSNESS, BUILDING ON THE 
21:15:39 HUD VETERAN AFFAIRS HOUSING MODELS, AND THEN ALSO IN PARTICULAR ALSO TREATING 
21:15:44 HOUSING AS AN INFRASTRUCTURE AT THIS UNIQUE MOMENT WHEN WE'RE TALKING TO 
21:15:48 BUILD BACK BETTER AND ALSO WITH LABOR, WE ARE LOOKING AT DIFFERENT WAYS 
21:15:52 WHETHER IT'S SUPPORTING THROUGH THE RENTAL ASSISTANCE THE BEST WAYS TO 
21:15:57 KEEP PEOPLE HOUSED OR BY UPSCALING PEOPLE WITH WORKFORCE  DEVELOPMENT 
21:16:02 THROUGH EDUCATIONAL EFFORTS IN PARTNERSHIP WITH LABOR GROUPS AND 
21:16:11 EDUCATIONAL -- IT'S BEEN SOMETHING THAT I GUESS SUZANNE, YOU CAN CONFIRM WITH 
21:16:14 ME BUT I THINK THAT BEFORE THE HOLIDAYS, WE HAVE AS A CITY DELIVERED 
21:16:20 OVER $10 MILLION TO 777 FAMILIES, AND WE ALSO WORK ON EAST BAY COMMUNITY 
21:16:24 ENERGY AND OTHER AREAS TO REMEMBER ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS THAT HELP WITH 
21:16:34 SOME OF THE BACK -- UTILITIES, WHICH I THINK MANY PEOPLE HAVE HELD OUT WITH.

21:16:40 ALSO WE CAN -- LIKE THE HOUSING INNOVATION FUND.

21:16:44 HOPEFULLY TOMORROW WE'LL GET SOME -- ABOUT 12 HOURS, WE'LL GET SOME MORE 
21:16:44 GUIDANCE.

21:16:52 I KNOW MY FELLOW -- A PANEL ON THIS DISCUSSION SPECIFICALLY ON FEDERAL AND 
21:16:55 LOCAL STRATEGIES AND INITIATIVES SPECIFICALLY TO FOCUS ON HOMELESSNESS.

21:17:01 AND SO WE'LL BE TALKING DIRECTLY TO THE U.S. INTERAGENCY COUNCIL ON 
21:17:05 HOMELESSNESS AS WELL AS SPEAKING WITH THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND 
21:17:05 URBAN DEVELOPMENT.

21:17:09 SO I WILL BE HAPPY TO REPORT BACK ANYTHING THAT WE'RE ABLE TO MAKE 
21:17:14 PROGRESS ON AND I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO CHAMPION THAT FOR OUR 
21:17:15 COMMUNITY AND TO ADVOCATE FOR THAT.

21:17:23 BUT WITH THAT, I THINK WE HAVE A MOTION BY COUNCILMEMBER JONES, I THINK, AND 
21:17:24 SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER COX.

21:17:33 SO I'M HAPPY TO SECOND, I THINK WE ALL AGREE, BUT ONE THING I'VE HEARD FROM 
21:17:35 THE COUNCIL THIS EVENING AND THE PUBLIC SPEAKERS IS THAT WE RECOGNIZE THAT 
21:17:41 THERE IS TREMENDOUS NEED IN OUR PUBLIC, AND I ALSO, TOO, WANTED TO ECK COAL -- 
21:17:48 DAN HAD THANKED OUR STAFF, TO ALL THOSE WHO ARE WORKING WITH US.

21:17:54 AND I HEARD VERY GOOD THINGS ABOUT SANG LA AND FOR STEP UP, I'M TRYING TO 
21:18:00 REMEMBER, I APOLOGIZE, I'M ON THE 19TH RIGHT NOW, BUT -- HOUSING PROVIDER, 
21:18:05 AND SO THE WRAP-AROUND SERVICES ARE CRITICAL AND KEY FOR US, AND SO WITH 
21:18:08 THAT, CAN I GET A ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE, AND THEN ALSO PLEASE NOTE THAT 
21:18:16 I WOULD LIKE TO ADJOURN IN HONOR OF MS. JAO.

21:18:19 >> Ms. Gauthier: COUNCILMEMBER COX, AYE.

21:18:20 COUNCILMEMBER SHAO --

21:18:21 >> ABSOLUTELY.

21:18:31 VICE MAYOR SALWAN, AYE.

21:18:34 MAYOR MEI, AYE.

21:18:37 >> Mayor Mei: SO THIS MOTION PASSES UNANIMOUSLY.

21:18:41 I THINK THE TIMING WILL ALLOW US THE SUPPORT THAT NEEDS TO MAXIMIZE, AND 
21:18:46 AGAIN WHILE SOME OF THIS MONEY IS FEDERAL GRANTS, WE ARE APPLYING -- FOR 
21:18:50 OTHER GRANT PROGRAMS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE INCLUDING COUNTY MEASURE W 
21:18:55 GRANTS AND OTHERS, SO THEREFORE, AGAIN, FOR ALL OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE READ TO US 
21:19:03 AND SPOKE WITH US THIS EVENING, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND OR SUPPORT YOUR NICHE 
21:19:08 KATE TO GET THE FUNDING BECAUSE THAT WOULD HELP US TREMENDOUSLY, YOU HEARD 
21:19:10 THAT WOULD HELP US OFFSET SOME OF THE COSTS.

21:19:18 SO SPEAKING WITH HOMELESSNESS, WE WERE VERY SAD TO LEARN THIS WEEK THAT WE 
21:19:24 HAD A COMMUNITY MEMBER LOST IN A TRAGEDY WHERE THEY WERE MURDERED 
21:19:28 BASICALLY IN MY OPINION, BUT -- AND PUSHED ON TO THE TRACKS.

21:19:36 AND SO I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE ABLE TO HONOR THAT AND TO NOTE 
21:19:42 THAT WITH A MOMENT OF SILENCE, PLEASE, IF YOU DON'T MIND, AND I KNOW THAT 
21:19:53 THERE WAS A VIGIL THAT'S GOING TO BE HELD AT SAN FRANCISCO FOR MICHELE, IF 
21:19:55 WE COULD PAUSE FOR A MOMENT OF SILENCE.

21:19:55 THANK YOU.

21:20:10 THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

21:20:15 I ALSO WANTED TO NOTE THAT I KNOW THAT IN THE FREMONT AREA, HER FAMILY 
21:20:19 RESIDES HERE AND AS WELL AS THE FACT THAT WE HAVE GOOD LEADERSHIP AND 
21:20:22 PARTNERSHIP WITH SOME OF OUR COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATIONS, AND 
21:20:27 I'VE BEEN REACHED OUT TO BY CITIZENS FOR A BETTER COMMUNITY, SO HOPEFULLY 
21:20:34 WE ARE LOOKING TO DO AN EVENT THAT WOULD HONOR AND HELP TO BE ABLE TO DO 
21:20:36 PROVIDE A VIGIL IN TERMS OF THIS TRAGEDY.

21:20:38 AND SO I WANTED TO NOTE THAT.

21:20:42 THERE WILL BE INFORMATION FORTHCOMING ONCE WE ARE ABLE TO TALK TO THE 
21:20:43 ORGANIZATION.

21:20:49 I DON'T KNOW IF WE HAVE ANY REPORT OUT TONIGHT, BUT I THINK IT BEEN A LONG 
21:20:54 MEETING FOR ME AND FOR ALL OF US, I THINK, BUT I WANTED TO THANK, AGAIN, 
21:21:00  EVERYONE'S COMPASSION AND PROOF THAT WE ARE A CARING CITY AND ONE THAT IS 
21:21:03 UNITED, AT LEAST, IN TERMS OF SUPPORTING THE RESOURCES THAT ARE 
21:21:05 NEEDED TO HELP THOSE MOST VULNERABLE.

21:21:11 AND WITH THAT, I'D LIKE TO ADJOURN THE MEETING AT THIS  TIME.

21:21:15 SO THANK YOU SO MUCH, AND HOPE THAT YOU ARE ALL SAFE AND  STAYING HEALTHY.

21:21:18 AND THANK YOU TO THE STAFF FOR ALL YOUR SUPPORT.

21:21:21 AND FOR ALL THE PEOPLE WHO SPOKE TONIGHT, THANK YOU.

21:21:22 MEETING ADJOURNED.
