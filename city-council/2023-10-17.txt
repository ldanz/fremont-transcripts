I'M

[Captioner] 19:16:33
 EXTREMELY EXCITED ABOUT WHAT I WANT TO SHARE WITH ALL OF YOU AND ANNOUNCE.


[Captioner] 19:16:37
IT'S ESPECIALLY BECAUSE WE JUST HAD THE PROCLAMATION FOR FILIPINO AMERICAN HISTORY MONTH,

[Captioner] 19:16:42
 SO THE MAYOR AND I HAVE BEEN WORKING FOR THE LAST COUPLE

[Captioner] 19:16:47
 WEEKS WITH ONE OF THE LARGEST PHILIPPIAN

[Captioner] 19:16:51
 CHURCH ORGANIZATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES, AND I HAD JUST GOT

[Captioner] 19:16:55
 OFF THE PHONE WITH THEM, AS WELL AS THE MANAGEMENT TEAM WITH

 PAPPE MACHINERY.
THEY BOTH HAVE WORKED TOGETHER AND AGREED THAT ON

[Captioner] 19:17:39
 I THINK I'M DONE.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:17:46
>> Ms. Gauthier: KELLY ROSE.
>> Mayor Mei: WELCOME, KELLY.
>> Ms. Gauthier:

[Captioner] 19:17:50
 FOLLOWED BY JOHN HINDS.


[Captioner] 19:17:55
>> GOOD EVENING.
THANKS FOR HAVING ME.
I'M HERE TONIGHT AS

[Captioner] 19:18:00
 A PRIVATE CITIZEN CONCERNED ABOUT A

[Captioner] 19:18:05
 HOMELESS ENCAMPMENT THAT IS ON THE RISE ON

[Captioner] 19:18:10
 CHAPELWAY IN FREMONT AT IRVINGTON AVENUE.


[Captioner] 19:18:16
THIS ENCAMPMENT HAS DOUBLED IN THE LAST WEEK.


[Captioner] 19:18:20
THERE'S APPROXIMATELY FIVE RVs

[Captioner] 19:18:24
 AND THREE CARS ON THE NORTHBOUND SIDE OF CHAPEL WAY, AND

[Captioner] 19:18:30
 THERE'S 3RVs AND ONE CAR ON THE SOUTHBOUND SIDE.
ALL OF THESE

[Captioner] 19:18:34
 VEHICLES ARE WITHIN 166 YARDS OF

[Captioner] 19:18:38
 THE SCHOOL.
THEY ALL FALL WAY

[Captioner] 19:18:42
 CLOSER THAN THAT.
I SPOKE WITH THE PRINCIPAL

[Captioner] 19:18:47
 TODAY, CHRIS -- I CAN'T REMEMBER HER LAST NAME, WHO SAYS THAT

[Captioner] 19:18:53
 SHE HAS BEEN IN COMMUNICATION WITH THE HOMELESS TASK FORCE, THE POLICE DEPARTMENT

[Captioner] 19:18:57
 AND ALSO SUPERINTENDENT

[Captioner] 19:19:02
 CAMMACK WITH

[Captioner] 19:19:07
 NO AVAIL.
I ALSO MET WITH --

[Captioner] 19:19:11
 FLORES AND OFFICER MANDY SING AS THEY WERE COMING OUT TO SURVEY

[Captioner] 19:19:15
 THE SITUATION BASED ON THE NUMEROUS COMPLAINTS.
SO MY

[Captioner] 19:19:19
 CONCERN IS THAT IT'S A PUBLIC

[Captioner] 19:19:23
 SAFETY ISSUE, NOT ONLY TO THE CHILDREN BUT TO THE PUBLIC.
YOU CANNOT

[Captioner] 19:19:28
 FREELY DRIVE DOWN THE NORTHBOUND OR SOUTHBOUND LANES

[Captioner] 19:19:32
 OF CHAPEL WAY BECAUSE THERE'S A PROPANE TANK ON THE

[Captioner] 19:19:36
 NORTHBOUND SIDE AND THERE'S A GENERATOR IN THE STREET ON THE

[Captioner] 19:19:41
 SOUTHBOUND.
WE COMPLAIN, THEY MOVE THEM, BUT ALSO THE STREETS ARE

[Captioner] 19:19:45
 OBSTRUCTED -- OR EXCUSE ME -- THE SIDEWALKS ARE

[Captioner] 19:19:49
 OBSTRUCTED SO THE KIDS ARE NOT ALLOWED NOW TO BE WALKING FREELY DOWN THE STREETS, AND PERSONALLY

[Captioner] 19:19:53
 I WOULDN'T WANT MY 11-YEAR-OLD WALKING TO HORNER SCHOOL ON THESE STREETS BECAUSE

[Captioner] 19:19:57
 THERE'S OFTENTIMES FECES, NEEDLES, BEER

[Captioner] 19:20:02
 BOTTLES, GLASSES OF URINE, DEBRIS,

[Captioner] 19:20:07
 GARBAGE, AND AS OF MONDAY, YESTERDAY, THERE WAS TWO PIT BULLS.


[Captioner] 19:20:12
AND WHETHER THEY'RE AGGRESSIVE OR NOT, I DON'T KNOW.
BUT I KNOW

[Captioner] 19:20:16
 THAT THERE'S OTHER CITIES

[Captioner] 19:20:21
 IN CALIFORNIA.
IN L.A., THEY HAVE

[Captioner] 19:20:26
 PUT A BAN ON -- THEY HAVE AN ORDINANCE, I GUESS I WANT TO KNOW WHAT

[Captioner] 19:20:30
 FREMONT IS GOING TO BE DOING ABOUT THIS.
IT ALSO IS NEXT TO A CEMETERY, THERE'S

[Captioner] 19:20:35
 BEEN CONSIDERABLE VANDALISM.
THEY HAVE SET VANS ON

[Captioner] 19:20:39
 FIRE, THEY HAVE DISRUPTED

[Captioner] 19:20:43
 PROCESSIONS, AND IT JUST CONTINUES AND I'M HOPING SOMETHING CAN BE DONE BY FREMONT TO BRING IN AN

[Captioner] 19:20:48
 ORDINANCE TO MAKE A

[Captioner] 19:20:52
 BAND FOR ENCAMPMENTS BY SCHOOLS.
IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE IF

[Captioner] 19:20:56
 IT'S CONTINUED TO BE ALLOWED.
AND JUST REALLY QUICKLY, BUT THE HOMELESS

[Captioner] 19:21:00
 TASK FORCE LADY SAID THEY'RE DOING THE BEST THEY CAN, BUT THEY'RE NOT.


[Captioner] 19:21:07
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
>> Ms. Gauthier: JOHN HINDS.


[Captioner] 19:21:12
>> HELLO, EVERYONE.
ONE OF THE BIG PROBLEMS WITH ONLINE

[Captioner] 19:21:17
 DISCOURSE THESE DAYS IS THAT WHEN PEOPLE CAN MAKE COMMENTS ANONYMOUSLY,

[Captioner] 19:21:21
 OR EVEN JUST REMOTELY, THEY CAN BE TEMPTED TO SAY THINGS THEY WOULD NOT

[Captioner] 19:21:25
 SAY WHEN FACING A REAL PERSON.
AND FOR THAT REASON, I THINK

[Captioner] 19:21:29
 THESE RECENT CHANGES TO THE ZOOM COMMENTING POLICY ARE MOSTLY A GOOD THING.


[Captioner] 19:21:33
THERE'S A DIFFERENT TEMPTATION THAT HAS CONCERNED ME FOR A FEW YEARS, THOUGH, AND

[Captioner] 19:21:37
 THAT'S THAT ZOOM OFFERS TOOLS TO MEETING ORGANIZERS WHICH THEY COULD

[Captioner] 19:21:42
 USE TO CURATE, CENSOR OR OTHERWISE LIMIT THE SPEECH OF

[Captioner] 19:21:46
 PEOPLE THAT MIGHT BE UNFLATTERING OR INCONVENIENT.


[Captioner] 19:21:52
DO I THINK THAT'S HAPPENED IN THESE MEETINGS HERE?
I DON'T THINK SO,

[Captioner] 19:21:56
 BUT IF IT HAD HAPPENED, IT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED OUT OF PUBLIC VIEW AND THOSE OF US IN THE

[Captioner] 19:22:00
 AUDIENCE CAN'T REALLY KNOW, THAT NATURALLY LOWERS OUR CONFIDENCE THAT THESE MEETINGS ARE ALL ON

[Captioner] 19:22:05
 THE UP AND UP COMPARED TO AN OPEN MEETING FORMAT LIKE THAT.
THAT'S

[Captioner] 19:22:08
 JUST ONE OF THE COSTS OF USING ZOOM.
THE PROBLEM IS NOT LIMITED TO ZOOM, THOUGH.


[Captioner] 19:22:13
LAST MONTH, I WAS AT A TALK BY AN ALAMEDA

[Captioner] 19:22:17
 COUNTY OFFICIAL WHICH ALLOWED QUESTIONS FROM THE PUBLIC, BUT THE QUESTIONS WERE ROUTED THROUGH

[Captioner] 19:22:21
 A MODERATOR, WHO AS IT TURNED OUT WAS A CLOSE ALLY OF THE SPEAKER.
NOW

[Captioner] 19:22:25
 WAS THE MODERATOR DOING A GREAT, EVEN-HANDED

[Captioner] 19:22:30
 JOB OF -- OR WAS HE CAREFULLY CURATING

[Captioner] 19:22:34
 THEM TO BENEFIT THE SPEAKER?
IN THE AUDIENCE, WE COULD NOT KNOW, THAT

[Captioner] 19:22:39
 NATURALLY REDUCED -- WHEN YOU EXPOSE YOUR THOUGHTS TO PUBLIC CRITICISM

[Captioner] 19:22:43
 OR EVEN RIDICULE, THAT IS A SIGN OF STRENGTH AND OVER TILE, IT COULD HELP MAKE YOUR THOUGHTS STRONGER

[Captioner] 19:22:47
 THROUGH THE TESTING AND CHALLENGING THEY GET.
WHEN INSTEAD YOU

[Captioner] 19:22:52
 GIVE IN TO THE TEMPTATION TO CONTROL SPEECH, THAT IS A SIGN

[Captioner] 19:22:56
 OF WEAKNESS AND OVER TIME, IT MAKES YOUR THOUGHTS WEAKER.
IN THESE MEETINGS HERE,

[Captioner] 19:23:00
 I HAVE THROWN SOME PRETTY ROUGH STUFF AT THE COUNCIL OVER THE YEARS.
TO

[Captioner] 19:23:04
 YOUR CREDIT, YOU HAVE TAKEN IT.
THERE WAS MAYBE ONE EXCEPTION, BUT NEVER

[Captioner] 19:23:08
 MIND THAT.
SARCASM IS NOT NICE.


[Captioner] 19:23:12
IT CAN BE VERY UNPLEASANT TO RECEIVE, BUT SARCASM IS A

[Captioner] 19:23:16
 PERFECTLY LEGITIMATE TOOL OF COMMUNICATION, AND WHEN YOU HAVE LIMITED TIME, IT CAN BE THE

[Captioner] 19:23:21
 ONLY WAY TO GET A POINT ACROSS.


[Captioner] 19:23:26
NICENESS, POLITENESS ARE GOOD THINGS.
THEY ARE NOT SUBSTITUTES FOR CONTENT OR CLARITY.


[Captioner] 19:23:30
WHEN SOMEBODY YOU KNOW COMES BACK FROM THE HAIRDRESSER AND ASKS, HOW DOES IT LOOK AND

[Captioner] 19:23:35
 YOU'RE THINKING, UM, UH, YOU MIGHT FIND

[Captioner] 19:23:39
 A TEMPORARY WAY TO GET OUT OF THIS JAM TODAY, BUT IF YOU

[Captioner] 19:23:44
 CARE, YOU SHOULD SAY SOMETHING BECAUSE THAT'S USEFUL INFORMATION, WHETHER IT'S WHAT

[Captioner] 19:23:48
 THE PERSON WANTED TO HEAR AT THE MOMENT OR NOT.
IN THESE MEETINGS HERE GOING FORWARD, 

[Captioner] 19:23:52
IN THOSE MOMENTS WHEN YOU FEEL THE GREATEST TEMPTATION TO LIMIT SOMEONE'S SPEECH BECAUSE

[Captioner] 19:23:56
 IT'S NOT NICE, THOSE ARE THE MOMENTS WHEN YOU SHOULD EXERCISE THE GREATEST

[Captioner] 19:24:00
 RESTRAINT BECAUSE THEY'RE ALSO THE MOMENTS WHEN YOU ARE MOST LIKELY TO BE IN THE WRONG.


[Captioner] 19:24:06
CRITTISMS, DISSENTING SPEECH ARE VIABLE INFORMATION EVEN WHEN PRESENTED RUDELY BY RUDE PEOPLE.


[Captioner] 19:24:14
>> Ms. Gauthier: THE NEXT SPEAKER IS DANIEL

[Captioner] 19:24:19
 CARPELOVICH.


[Captioner] 19:24:24
>> GOOD EVENING, COUNCILMEMBERS AND MAYOR MEI.
I LIVE IN THE

[Captioner] 19:24:29
 BROOKVALE NEIGHBORHOOD IN DISTRICT 2.
I COME TO YOU TO BRING ATTENTION TO AN

[Captioner] 19:24:33
 ISSUE I THINK YOU'LL AGREE IS RELEVANT TO ALL RESIDENTS OF FREMONT.
THAT

[Captioner] 19:24:37
 IS MY MORNING BIKE COMMUTE TO THE TRAIN STATION.
I'M JOKING OF COURSE

[Captioner] 19:24:41
 BUT IT OPENS MY EYES TO A SAFETY ISSUE EVERY TIME I HAPPEN TO BE

[Captioner] 19:24:45
 RIDING BY AMERICAN HIGH AROUND 8:00 A.M.
THE

[Captioner] 19:24:49
 BIKE INFRASTRUCTURE IS BUILT IN SUCH A WAY THAT THE OVERWHELMING NUMBER OF PARENTS

[Captioner] 19:24:53
 DOUBLE PARKING IN THE BIKE LANE

[Captioner] 19:24:58
 DROPPING OF OH THEIR KIDS MAKE IT COMPLETELY UNSAFE AND UNUSABLE.
WHEN PARENTS SEE THIS

[Captioner] 19:25:02
 THEY DON'T FEEL SAFE LETTING THEIR KIDS RIDING TO SCHOOL AND DRIVE THEM

[Captioner] 19:25:05
 INSTEAD.
THIS MAKES MORE TRAFFIC, MAKING IT LESS SAFE TO BIKE OR WALK.


[Captioner] 19:25:10
IF IT SOUNDS LIKE I'M TALKING IN CIRCLES IT'S BECAUSE THIS IS AN INSIDIOUS

[Captioner] 19:25:14
 CYCLE THAT MAKES ITSELF WORSE AND WORSE IF IT IS NOT STOPPED.
PLEASE ASK THESE

[Captioner] 19:25:18
 QUESTIONS WHEN PLANS AND PROJECTS ARE BROUGHT TO YOU FOR APPROVAL.
ASK YOUR

[Captioner] 19:25:22
 STAFF, HOW WILL THIS DESIGN PREVENT BIKE INFRASTRUCTURE FROM BEING TAKEN OVER

[Captioner] 19:25:26
 BY CARS?
SIGNS AND

[Captioner] 19:25:31
 PAINT DO NOT AGAINST THE OVERWHELMING FORCE

[Captioner] 19:25:38
 OF PARENTS, ABOVE ALL ELSE.
DO NOT ALLOW FOR COMPROMISES IN THE DESIGNS WHEN

[Captioner] 19:25:42
 THEY WILL PUT KIDS AND THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN DANGER EVERY WEEKDAY MORNING AND AFTERNOON.


[Captioner] 19:25:46
A ROAD DESIGN DOES NOT NEED TO BE WELL DESIGNED FOR NOON ON A

[Captioner] 19:25:51
 SATURDAY.
DESIGNED FOR 8:00 A.M. ON A

[Captioner] 19:25:55
 WEDNESDAY.
THANK YOU.
>> Ms.

[Captioner] 19:25:59
 Gauthier: THAT WAS THE LAST SPEAKER.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
I WANTED TO JUST ADD

[Captioner] 19:26:04
 SOME UPCOMING EVENTS AND AK SE

[Captioner] 19:26:08
 ACCESS, WHILE I CAN'T ANSWER NON- AGENDIZED QUESTIONS THERE'S A COUPLE THINGS

[Captioner] 19:26:12
 I WANT TO SHARE.
ONE IS OUR CITY IS IN THE PROCESS OF DOING AN ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION 

[Captioner] 19:26:16
MANAGEMENT PLAN, AND AS SUCH, WE ARE ROTATING THROUGH THE DISTRICTS WITH WALKS AND

[Captioner] 19:26:20
 RIDES, AS WELL AS THERE'S BEEN A SURVEY SO I'D LIKE TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO CONTINUE TO

[Captioner] 19:26:24
 PARTICIPATE IN THAT.
IN FACT, THIS WEEKEND WE HAD TWO OF THOSE IN OUR CITY.


[Captioner] 19:26:29
AND THEN ALSO I WANTED TO NOTE THAT FOR THE COMMENTS IN GENERAL ABOUT

[Captioner] 19:26:34
 THE SCHOOL AND THE CITY, THE SCHOOL AND THE CITY HAS A JOINT MEETING

[Captioner] 19:26:38
 A COUPLE TIMES A YEAR, THREE TIMES A YEAR, AND THERE'S ACTUALLY ONE COMING UP ON

[Captioner] 19:26:44
 OCTOBER 30TH, WHAT WOULD HAVE NORMALLY BEEN OCTOBER 2ND BUT IT'S RESCHEDULED TO OCTOBER 30TH.


[Captioner] 19:26:48
SO IF THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO ADDRESS THINGS OF INTEREST TO

[Captioner] 19:26:52
 THE TWO PARTIES, THAT MIGHT BE A

[Captioner] 19:26:56
 A GOOD PLACE TO EXPRESS THAT BECAUSE WE WILL BOTH BE

[Captioner] 19:27:01
 THERE, SUPERINTENDENT CAMMACK, THE TRUSTEES AS WELL AS THE COUNCIL.
SO I JUST WANT TO

[Captioner] 19:27:05
 THANK EVERYONE FOR YOUR FEEDBACK.


[Captioner] 19:27:09
AND ALSO IF YOU HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO RIGHT NOW, WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF DOING A

[Captioner] 19:27:14
 HOMELESSNESS RESPONSE PLAN COMMUNITY SURVEY, SO I'D ASK THAT PEOPLE PROVIDE THOSE

[Captioner] 19:27:18
 FEEDBACKS, AND THEN ALSO AS WE AND THE COUNCIL, WHILE

[Captioner] 19:27:23
 WE MAY REPRESENT PARTS OF THE CITY AND DISTRICT, I BELIEVE WE ARE INTERESTED IN

[Captioner] 19:27:27
 ALL OF THE CITY AND ALL THE DISTRICTS, AND SO YOU'RE ALSO WELCOME TO SPEAK WITH

[Captioner] 19:27:31
 US, BECAUSE WE WILL ALSO BE SPEAKING WITH OUR CONSULTANTS AS

[Captioner] 19:27:36
 WE WORK THROUGH THIS PROCESS.
SO THANK YOU FOR OUTREACH AND FOR ALL THE COMMENTS OF THE

[Captioner] 19:27:40
 PEOPLE WHO'VE COME THIS EVENING.
NEXT ON OUR AGENDA ITEM IS

[Captioner] 19:27:44
 ACTUALLY OUR RENT REVIEW ORDINANCE ANNUAL REPORT.
AND PROGRAM FEE.


[Captioner] 19:27:49
 DISCUSSION.
OUR CDBG ADMINISTRATOR ROBERT

[Captioner] 19:27:54
 LOPEZ WILL BE PROVIDING AN OVERVIEW, AND SO

[Captioner] 19:27:58
 THIS IS A PUBLIC HEARING, SO I'D LIKE TO WELCOME

[Captioner] 19:28:02
 MR. LOPEZ.
GOOD EVENING.
>> GOOD EVENING,

[Captioner] 19:28:06
 MAYOR MEI AND CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS.
THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.


[Captioner] 19:28:11
JUST QUICKLY, THE RENT REVIEW, THE ITEM BEFORE YOU

[Captioner] 19:28:15
 TONIGHT IS THE ANNUAL RENT REVIEW ORDINANCE REPORT

[Captioner] 19:28:19
 FOR FISCAL YEAR 2022 COVERING JULY 1ST, 2022 TO

[Captioner] 19:28:24
 JUNE 30TH, 2023.
THE SECOND PART IS ALSO THE FISCAL YEAR 2023 FEE

[Captioner] 19:28:29
 SETTING RECOMMENDATION OF $14 PER RENT REVIEW ELIGIBLE UNIT.
BOTH

[Captioner] 19:28:33
 OF THESE ITEMS ARE REQUIRED BY THE RENT REVIEW ORDINANCE TO BE BROUGHT TO THE CITY COUNCIL

[Captioner] 19:28:38
 ANNUALLY FOR RECEIVING AND APPROVAL, AND I AM HERE IF YOU HAVE

[Captioner] 19:28:42
 ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THE STAFF REPORT OR THE RECOMMENDATION.
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY.


[Captioner] 19:28:46
THANK YOU.
FIRST, I'LL TURN TO THE -- FOR THE QUESTIONS OF

[Captioner] 19:28:50
 THE STAFF.
THIS IS CLARIFYING QUESTIONS AT

[Captioner] 19:28:54
 THIS TIME FROM THE COUNCILMEMBERS.
SEEING

[Captioner] 19:28:59
 NONE, I'M GOING TO NOW OPEN THE PUBLIC HEARING, AND SO IF WE COULD OPEN THE PUBLIC

[Captioner] 19:29:02
 HEARING.
>> Councilmember Kassan: I'M SORRY, I DID HAVE ONE.


[Captioner] 19:29:06
I DID HAVE A QUESTION.
>> Mayor Mei: OH.
OKAY, I DIDN'T SEE YOUR BUTTON.


[Captioner] 19:29:11
SO THANK YOU.
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, DO YOU HAVE

[Captioner] 19:29:15
 CLARIFYING QUESTIONS?
>> Councilmember Kassan: YEAH, I KNOW IT'S -- WE DON'T HAVE THE DATA BECAUSE 

[Captioner] 19:29:19
I DID ASK, BUT DO YOU HAVE A SENSE OF WHAT'S HAPPENING

[Captioner] 19:29:23
 WITH EE VIKS IN THE CITY OF FREMONT, JUST BASED ANECDOTALLY ON

[Captioner] 19:29:28
 WHAT YOU'VE BEEN OBSERVING IN THE LAST YEAR OR

[Captioner] 19:29:32
 SO?
>> YEAH, BASELINE -- WHAT WE'RE SEEING THROUGH

[Captioner] 19:29:36
 OUR HOUSING STABILIZATION PROGRAM, THE UNLAWFUL

[Captioner] 19:29:39
 DETAINERS THAT RESIDENTS HAVE BEEN BRINGING TO US HAVE BEEN COMING IN WAVES.


[Captioner] 19:29:43
SO FIRST WE'LL GET LIKE A GROUP OF MAYBE FIVE OR SIX, THEN IT WILL BE

[Captioner] 19:29:47
 QUIET FOR A LITTLE WHILE, THEN ANOTHER GROUP OF LIKE FIVE OR SIX OR SEVEN WILL COME TO US.


[Captioner] 19:29:52
AND THAT'S MAINLY BECAUSE THE COURTS ARE ALSO

[Captioner] 19:29:56
 BACKED UP.
THEY'RE SEEING -- THEY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH STAFF OR JUDGES TO GET ALL

[Captioner] 19:30:00
 THE UNLAWFUL DETAINER CASES THROUGH.
SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE SEEING RIGHT NOW.


[Captioner] 19:30:05
I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY GOING TO CONTINUE.
>> Councilmember Kassan:

[Captioner] 19:30:09
 I IMAGINE, I MEAN, WHAT YOU'RE SEEING IS PROBABLY JUST A SUBSET OF

[Captioner] 19:30:13
 WHAT'S OUT THERE, BECAUSE NOT EVERY12 GETS

[Captioner] 19:30:17
 EVICTED WOULD NECESSARILY CONTACT THE CITY, IS THAT RIGHT?
>> THAT'S TRUE.


[Captioner] 19:30:21
I THINK A LOT OF FOLKS ARE DEFINITELY LOOKING FOR RESOURCES OUT THERE FOR THEIR SITUATION.


[Captioner] 19:30:26
WE TRAY OUR BEST TO GET THE WORD OUT THAT WE HAVE THESE RESOURCES HERE.
I

[Captioner] 19:30:30
 KNOW ALAMEDA COUNTY HAS ALSO DONE THEIR OWN OUTREACH.


[Captioner] 19:30:35
SO YEAH, WE'RE PROBABLY ONLY SEEING A LITTLE BIT OF THE ISSUE

[Captioner] 19:30:39
 HERE.
>> Councilmember Kassan: OKAY.
I READ THE REPORT AND IT WAS, YOU 

[Captioner] 19:30:43
KNOW, SOME GOOD INFORMATION IN THERE, BUT I JUST -- I REALLY JUST DIDN'T GET A

[Captioner] 19:30:48
 SENSE OF KIND OF THE BIGGER PICTURE OF SORT OF HOW ARE RENTERS DOING

[Captioner] 19:30:53
 IN FREMONT.
DO YOU HAVE ANY OTHER DATA OR

[Captioner] 19:30:56
 JUST ANECDOTAL INFORMATION TO SHARE ON KIND OF THE STATE OF RENTERS RIGHT NOW IN FREMONT?


[Captioner] 19:31:03
>> NOT AT THIS TIME.
I THINK A LOT -- FROM WHAT WE'VE SEEN JUST

[Captioner] 19:31:07
 THROUGH THE RENT REVIEW PROGRAM AS FAR AS CONSULTATIONS AND

[Captioner] 19:31:11
 MEDIATIONS, A LOT OF LANDLORDS AND TENANTS WANT TO

[Captioner] 19:31:16
 WORK TOGETHER TO FIND A SOLUTION

[Captioner] 19:31:21
, SO THAT'S BEEN REALLY GOOD TO SEE.
SO THAT'S REALLY ALL I HAVE FROM

[Captioner] 19:31:24
 THAT.
>> Councilmember Kassan: OKAY.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:31:31
>> Mayor Mei: NEXT FOR CLARIFYING QUESTIONS, I HAVE COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL.


[Captioner] 19:31:37
>> Councilmember Campbell: THANK YOU.
THANK YOU FOR THIS REPORT.
I'M

[Captioner] 19:31:41
 JUST WONDERING, SINCE

[Captioner] 19:31:46
 THE 5% WENT FOR -- THEY COULDN'T INCREASE IT MORE THAN 5%, BUT YET ON THE

[Captioner] 19:31:51
 REPORT, IT'S SHOWING, YOU KNOW, UPWARDS OF 10%.
IS THAT

[Captioner] 19:31:55
 DUE TO THE PANDEMIC OR IS

[Captioner] 19:32:00
 THAT JUST LACK OF AWARENESS OF THE ORDINANCE?
>> THAT'S

[Captioner] 19:32:04
 ACTUALLY DUE TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA'S

[Captioner] 19:32:08
 LAW ON INCREASING RENT.
IF THEY HAVEN'T RAISED THE RENT OVER A NUMBER

[Captioner] 19:32:12
 OF YEARS, THEN THE LANDLORD IS ALLOWED TO RAISE

[Captioner] 19:32:17
 THE RENT, AS LONG AS

[Captioner] 19:32:21
 IT'S REASONABLE TO REACH MARKET RATE.
THE 5% THRESHOLD

[Captioner] 19:32:25
 IS REALLY THE THRESHOLD FOR ANY RESIDENT

[Captioner] 19:32:30
 TO BRING A CASE TO THE RENT REVIEW BOARD, SO THAT'S

[Captioner] 19:32:35
 OUR FREMONT --
>> Councilmember Campbell: SO IN OTHER WORDS, THEY HAVE

[Captioner] 19:32:39
 THE FREEDOM OF DOLLING IT, BUT IT CAN BE PROTESTED BASED

[Captioner] 19:32:44
 ON WHAT FREMONT HAS SAID SHOULD BE THE APPROPRIATE AMOUNT OF

[Captioner] 19:32:46
 RENTAL INCREASE?
>> THAT IS CORRECT.
>> Councilmember Campbell: OKAY.


[Captioner] 19:32:49
>> AND THEN WE ASSIST WITH ANY CONSULTATION OR MEDIATION THAT WE CAN.


[Captioner] 19:32:54
>> Councilmember Campbell: OKAY.
WELL, IT SEEMS LIKE YOU'VE BEEN DOING A REALLY GOOD JOB

[Captioner] 19:32:58
 BASED OP AT LEAST WHAT WE SEE HERE THAT YOU'VE BEEN ABLE TO

[Captioner] 19:33:02
 MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF HIGH RENT ON RENTERS.
SO THANK YOU FOR

[Captioner] 19:33:07
 THAT.
>> NO PROBLEM, THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK

[Captioner] 19:33:09
 YOU.
VICE MAYOR COX, CLARIFYING QUESTIONS, PLEASE.


[Captioner] 19:33:13
>> Vice Mayor Cox: YES.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR PROVIDING THIS REPORT.


[Captioner] 19:33:20
AND IN LIGHT OF WHAT YOU JUST MENTIONED ABOUT THE STATE AND

[Captioner] 19:33:25
 THE REQUIREMENTS SETTING THE RATE INCREASE, HELP

[Captioner] 19:33:29
 ME UNDERSTAND THAT YOU HAD ONE THAT WENT UP 31% OVER A TWO-YEAR

[Captioner] 19:33:34
 LEASE, AND IF YOU COULD PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT TO PROTECT PRIVACY AND ALL

[Captioner] 19:33:38
 THAT, BUT JUST TO KIND OF UNDERSTANDING, BECAUSE YOU GOT THE OTHER ONES A LITTLE

[Captioner] 19:33:43
 BIT ON THE AVERAGE OF 5 TO 10%,

[Captioner] 19:33:47
 BUT THIS ONE WAS 31%, WHICH KIND OF STOOD OUT A LITTLE

[Captioner] 19:33:51
 BIT MORE.
>> THAT ONE WAS DEFINITELY ONE OF

[Captioner] 19:33:55
 OUR ANOMALY CASES WHERE THE LANDLORD HASN'T RAISED RENTS IN A NUMBER OF

[Captioner] 19:34:00
 YEARS, SO I THINK -- I'D HAVE TO LOOK BACK ON THAT CASE,

[Captioner] 19:34:04
 BUT I BELIEVE THAT WAS WHAT THE CASE WAS.


[Captioner] 19:34:09
>> Vice Mayor Cox: IT KIND OF STOOD OUT THERE A LITTLE BIT AS AN OUTLIER WITH SOME OF

[Captioner] 19:34:14
 THE OTHER DATA, BUT WE REALLY APPRECIATE BEING ABLE TO HAVE LANDLORDS AND

[Captioner] 19:34:18
 TENANTS SIT AT THE TABLE AND WORK IT OUT AND NOT HAVE TO

[Captioner] 19:34:22
 GO THROUGH THE COSTLY COURT SYSTEMS TO APRIEF AT

[Captioner] 19:34:26
 A SETTLEMENT.
ANOTHER QUESTION I HAD WAS, YOU

[Captioner] 19:34:31
 KNOW, I -- RATES AND THINGS LIKE THAT YOU

[Captioner] 19:34:35
 SAID WERE SET BY THE STATE.
IS THERE ANY EXCEPTION

[Captioner] 19:34:40
 OR THINGS WRITTEN IN THE STATE LAW TO ALLOW THAT SOME OF THESE INCREASES COULD BE ALIGNED

[Captioner] 19:34:44
 WITH THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX THAT A LOT OF OTHER

[Captioner] 19:34:50
 GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES FOLLOW, KIND OF ALONG THOSE LINES, AND WHY IS THIS KIND

[Captioner] 19:34:54
 OF DIFFERENT KIND OF RULE COMPARED TO --

[Captioner] 19:34:58
 YOU KNOW, THIS IS HOUSING VERSUS EVERYTHING ELSE THAT WE KIND OF FOLLOW

[Captioner] 19:35:02
 IN THOSE LINES, SO I'M JUST KIND OF SERIOUS.
>> THAT'S A GREAT

[Captioner] 19:35:06
 QUESTION.
I STATE -- I DON'T KNOW WHY IT'S DIFFERENT FROM OTHER CITIES.


[Captioner] 19:35:11
DEFINITELY I'VE SEEN THE

[Captioner] 19:35:15
 CPI INDEX -- STATE OF CALIFORNIA, THERE'S NO EXCEPTION FOR THAT ONE.
>> Vice Mayor Cox: IS THERE ANY

[Captioner] 19:35:19
 CONSIDERATION, I KNOW YOU DIDN'T ADDRESS IT IN YOUR REPORT THAT YOU WERE LOOKING AT

[Captioner] 19:35:23
 THE 14%, WHICH KIND OF BETWEEN 5 --

[Captioner] 19:35:29
 8 TO 10% THERE, IS THERE ANYTHING THAT WE'D BE ABLE TO

[Captioner] 19:35:33
 EVEN MAKE SOME OTHER MODIFICATIONS TO KEEP IT IN LINE WITH THE CONSUMER

[Captioner] 19:35:37
 PRICE INDEX WITH TONIGHT'S DECISION?
BECAUSE I'M JUST TRYING TO

[Captioner] 19:35:41
 ARRIVE AT HOW DID YOU DECIDE ON THE 14 AS OPPOSED TO KEEPING IT

[Captioner] 19:35:46
 THE SAME AT 13 OR 13.5?
I KNOW YOU HAVE THAT FORMULA YOU

[Captioner] 19:35:51
 MENTIONED, BUT BASED ON INVENTORY, BASED ON THIS, BASED ON THAT, JUST KIND OF KEEPING

[Captioner] 19:35:55
 IT A LITTLE BIT

[Captioner] 19:35:59
 SIMPLER, BUT JUST ENLIGHTEN ME MORE.
>> ACTUALLY,

[Captioner] 19:36:03
 THE $14 PER UNIT IN FREMONT IS ONE OF THE LOWEST

[Captioner] 19:36:08
 RENT REVIEW FEES IN

[Captioner] 19:36:13
 THE -- SOLELY BASED ON COST RECOVERY.
SO THAT INCLUDES STAFFING,

[Captioner] 19:36:18
 PROGRAM, OPERATIONS SUCH AS OUR MEDIATORS, OUR CONTRACT WITH PROJECT

[Captioner] 19:36:22
 SENTINEL TO DO A LOT OF OUR LANDLORD TENANT WORK, IT'S

[Captioner] 19:36:26
 COMPLETE COST RECOVERY.
SO WE RUN A VERY

[Captioner] 19:36:30
 EFFICIENT PROGRAM SO THAT'S WHY WE'RE ABLE TO KEEP THE COSTS SO LOW.
>> Vice Mayor Cox: OKAY.


[Captioner] 19:36:33
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:36:37
AND AT THIS TIME, I WANT TO OPEN THE PUBLIC HEARING.


[Captioner] 19:36:41
AND ARE THERE ANY SPEAKER CARDS?
>> Ms. Gauthier: JUST ONE.
JOHN HINDS.


[Captioner] 19:36:47
>> Mayor Mei: WELCOME, MR. HINDS.


[Captioner] 19:36:52
>> BEFORE THAT NEXT TRIP TO THE STYLIST, OR BEFORE NEXT YEAR WHEN THIS ISSUE COMES UP

[Captioner] 19:36:57
 AGAIN, I SUGGEST A COMPLETE BOTTOM-UP REVIEW OF THE WHOLE PROGRAM.
I

[Captioner] 19:37:01
 THINK THERE'S ONE PART WORTH KEEPING AND THE REST PROBABLY SHOULD BE

[Captioner] 19:37:05
 SCRAP.
TOO LATE THIS TIME AROUND.
THE

[Captioner] 19:37:08
 PART WORTH KEEPING IS THE LONGER NOTIFICATION PERIOD FOR RENT INCREASES.


[Captioner] 19:37:13
I THINK THE CITY STAFF REPORT SAID IT'S 60 DAYS FOR

[Captioner] 19:37:17
 US, CALIFORNIA HAD 30 AND 90, DEPENDING ON HOW BIG IT WAS.
I DON'T

[Captioner] 19:37:21
 THINK THAT'S PARTICULARLY BURDENSOME ON

[Captioner] 19:37:25
 LANDLORDS, CERTAINLY IN COMPARISON TO PROVIDE

[Captioner] 19:37:30
 WRITTEN -- OR HAVING TO ATTEND MEDIATION, ESPECIALLY IF A TENANT HAS BEEN IN THE

[Captioner] 19:37:34
 SAME UNIT FOR SOME ARBITRARY -- LIKE THREE

[Captioner] 19:37:38
 OR FIVE YEARS, IT OBVIOUSLY A LONG TERM ECONOMIC

[Captioner] 19:37:44
 RELATIONSHIP.
ASIDE FROM THAT, THOUGH, THE REST COULD BE

[Captioner] 19:37:48
 BE SCRAPPED.
IF YOU SEE THE MEASURES OF PROGRESS, SO

[Captioner] 19:37:52
 MUCH OF IT TAKES THE FORM, THIS PERCENT INCREASE WAS REDUCED TO THIS PERCENT.


[Captioner] 19:37:56
THIS PERCENT WAS REDUCED TO THIS PERCENT.
CLEARLY THE CITY

[Captioner] 19:38:00
 SEES IT ASITY MISSION TO STEP IN

[Captioner] 19:38:04
 IN A PRIVATE ECONOMIC TRANSACTION AND FAVOR ONE SIDE IN PRIVATE NEGOTIATIONS.


[Captioner] 19:38:08
I DON'T KNOW WHEN THAT CAME APPROPRIATE.
IT MIGHT

[Captioner] 19:38:12
 WELL MAKE THE CITY VULNERABLE IN THE FUTURE.


[Captioner] 19:38:17
TO PROVIDE SOME BACKGROUND, WHY DON'T WE PUT STAFF MEMBERS AT THE

[Captioner] 19:38:20
 EXITS OF WASHINGTON HOSPITAL TO HELP PATIENTS NEGOTIATE THEIR BILLS ON THE WAY OUT?


[Captioner] 19:38:25
THOSE ARE HUGE, NOBODY KNOWS UNTIL A MONTH

[Captioner] 19:38:29
 OR TWO LATER WITH

[Captioner] 19:38:34
 OUR -- TO HELP SHOPPERS TALK THEIR GROCERY BILLS DOWN.


[Captioner] 19:38:39
WHY SHOULDN'T SUPERMARKETS HAVE TO PROVIDE WRITTEN JUST

[Captioner] 19:38:43
 TICS FOR RAISING EGGS 5%.
I HOPE NOBODY TAKES ME UP ON THAT.


[Captioner] 19:38:47
GROCERY PRICES ARE KNOWLEDGE DOMAIN OF THE CITY.


[Captioner] 19:38:52
THE CITY DOESN'T HAVE ANY VALUE TO ADD THERE, JUST LIKE IT

[Captioner] 19:38:57
 DOESN'T HAVE ANY VALUE TO ADD ON HOSPITAL PRICING, JUST LIKE IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY VALUE TO ADD

[Captioner] 19:39:00
 ON RENTAL PRICING.
THE MARKET MAY NOT BE PERFECT BUT WE'RE NOT GOING TO DO ANY BETTER.


[Captioner] 19:39:05
ALL WE'VE DONE HERE IS SAY WE TOOK IT DOWN SOME, LET'S CALL THAT A

[Captioner] 19:39:09
 VICTORY.
IF WE WANTED TO REDUCE THE SUPPLY OF RENTAL

[Captioner] 19:39:13
 HOUSING IN FREMONT, IF THAT WAS OUR GOAL, THIS WOULD BE ONE WAY TO DO IT.
BUT WE HAVE

[Captioner] 19:39:18
 OTHER POLICIES TO INCREASE THE SUPPLY OF RENTAL HOUSING IN FREMONT.
SO WE HAVE

[Captioner] 19:39:24
 MUTUALLY DESTRUCTIVE GOALS BASICALLY.
WE BURN UP ENERGY AND ACCOMPLISH NOTHING WITH

[Captioner] 19:39:27
 IT.
SO PLEASE TAKE A FRESH LOOK AT THIS WHOLE THING.


[Captioner] 19:39:32
KEEP SOME SIMPLE PARTS THAT HAVE A REALISTIC CHANCE OF HELPING,

[Captioner] 19:39:36
 AND THE COMPETING POLICIES, LET'S

[Captioner] 19:39:40
 SIMPLIFY AND GET RID OF THAT STUFF.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:39:46
>> Ms. Gauthier: THAT WAS THE LAST SPEAKER
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU, MA'AM.


[Captioner] 19:39:51
SO THAT WAS OUR LAST SPEAKER AND AT THIS TIME I'M GOING TO CLOSE THE PUBLIC

[Captioner] 19:39:55
 HEARING AND I'LL TURN IT BACK OVER TO THE COUNCIL FOR COMMENTS.
I'LL BEGIN

[Captioner] 19:39:59
 WITH COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN.


[Captioner] 19:40:05
>> Councilmember Kassan: ALL RIGHT.
WE HAVE VERY, VERY

[Captioner] 19:40:09
 EXPENSIVE HOUSING IN FREMONT.
I WAS SHOCKED WHEN I SAW

[Captioner] 19:40:14
 THE AVERAGE RENT OF $2,509 FOR A ONE-BEDROOM.


[Captioner] 19:40:19
I DID SOME MATH AND THAT IS REALLY -- THAT'S AFFORDABLE TO

[Captioner] 19:40:23
 SOMEONE WHO MAKES $120,000 A YEAR, WHICH IS QUITE HIGH.


[Captioner] 19:40:31
SO I REALLY WISH -- AND I DO WANT TO MAKE SURE

[Captioner] 19:40:35
 EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS, THIS PROCESS IS COMPLETELY VOLUNTARY.
WE'RE NOT

[Captioner] 19:40:39
 FORCING ANYONE TO LOWER THE RENT.
IT A

[Captioner] 19:40:43
 MEDIATION PROCESS AND I'M GLAD TO SEE THAT THERE ARE SOME SUCCESS STORIES.
BUT I

[Captioner] 19:40:47
 THINK WE HAVE A MUCH BIGGER PROBLEM THAN WHAT IS BEING ADDRESSED

[Captioner] 19:40:51
 BY THIS MEDIATION PROCESS, WHICH IS THAT THE

[Captioner] 19:40:56
 RENT IS TOO

[Captioner] 19:41:00
 DAMN HIGH.
SO I'M CONCERNED THAT WE DON'T HAVE DATA ON RENTERS

[Captioner] 19:41:05
 IN FREMONT.
AND I'M ALSO CONCERNED THAT

[Captioner] 19:41:09
 THE COUNCIL VOTED 6-1 AGAINST

[Captioner] 19:41:13
 EVEN LOOKING INTO EXPLORING THE POSSIBILITIES

[Captioner] 19:41:18
 OF ADDITIONAL PROTECTIONS FOR RENTERS.


[Captioner] 19:41:22
IF WE CARE ABOUT PREVENTING HOMELESSNESS, IF WE CARE ABOUT HAVING

[Captioner] 19:41:26
 A CITY THAT'S LIVABLE FOR PEOPLE OF MANY DIFFERENT LEVELS OF

[Captioner] 19:41:30
 INCOME, WHICH ULTIMATELY IS BEST FOR ALL BECAUSE IT ALLOWS

[Captioner] 19:41:34
 US TO HAVE PEOPLE LIVING HERE THAT CAN DO A LOT OF THE DIFFERENT JOBS THAT WE NEED FILLED WITHOUT THEM

[Captioner] 19:41:39
 HAVING TO COMMUTE FROM REALLY FAR AWAY.
SO

[Captioner] 19:41:43
 I JUST -- I REALLY WISH THAT THE COUNCIL WOULD RECONSIDER THE DECISION NOT

[Captioner] 19:41:47
 TO EVEN LET STAFF DO A LITTLE BIT OF ANALYSIS

[Captioner] 19:41:52
 OF POSSIBLE RENTER PROTECTIONS THAT COULD BE GOOD

[Captioner] 19:41:56
 THINGS TO CONSIDER IN OUR CITY, AND ALSO I JUST ALSO

[Captioner] 19:42:00
 REALLY WISH THAT WE COULD GET MORE DATA ON RENTERS

[Captioner] 19:42:04
 IN FREMONT, AND THEIR SITUATIONS.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:42:12
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
NEXT IS COUNCILMEMBER KENG.
>> Councilmember Keng: THANK

[Captioner] 19:42:15
 YOU, MAYOR.
AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE ANNUAL REPORT.


[Captioner] 19:42:21
SO WHILE CITY OF FREMONT DOESN'T HAVE A STRICT RENT CONTROL PROGRAM,

[Captioner] 19:42:25
 WE WANT TO SEE THE RIGHT OF BOTH LANDLORDS AND

[Captioner] 19:42:29
 TENANTS BEING PROTECTED, AND I THINK OUR RENT REVIEW BOARD

[Captioner] 19:42:33
 HAS, AGAIN, BEEN SHOWN THAT

[Captioner] 19:42:37
 WITH LAST YEAR'S REPORTING, IT HAS HELPED RESOLVE MORE THAN HALF OF THE REQUESTS FOR

[Captioner] 19:42:43
 MEDIATION AND AS YOU CAN SEE IN THE REPORT,

[Captioner] 19:42:47
 SOME WITH PRETTY SIGNIFICANT REDUCED RENT INCREASES, SO I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT

[Captioner] 19:42:51
 THE CONTINUATION OF THE PROGRAM AND THE NEW FEE SCHEDULE.
THANK

[Captioner] 19:42:54
 YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
NEXT IS COUNCILMEMBER SHAO.


[Captioner] 19:43:01
>> Councilmember Shao: THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR.
FROM MY

[Captioner] 19:43:06
 EXPERIENCE AT THE HOUSING AUTHORITY OF COUNTY OF ALAMEDA, WE LOOK AT

[Captioner] 19:43:11
 THE RENTS IN ALL THE CITIES UNDER

[Captioner] 19:43:16
 OUR JURISDICTION, AND AT LEAST FROM MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE, I DON'T

[Captioner] 19:43:20
 SEE THAT THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE

[Captioner] 19:43:24
 OR DIFFERENCE OF RENTS IN FREMONT COMPARING WITH NEIGHBORING CITIES.


[Captioner] 19:43:30
AS YOU ALL KNOW,

[Captioner] 19:43:34
 THE RENT IS PART OF THE REAL ESTATE MARKET, LOCATION, LOCATION,

[Captioner] 19:43:40
 LOCATION IS A FACTOR, AND EVEN BY SAYING THAT, THERE'S

[Captioner] 19:43:44
 NOT MUCH DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE RENTS HERE AND THE NEIGHBORING CITIES,

[Captioner] 19:43:49
 BUT STILL CONSIDER OVER HERE, PEOPLE TEND TO ENJOY LOW PRIME

[Captioner] 19:43:53
 RATE, GOOD PUBLIC SCHOOLS, AS WELL AS A COMMUNITY THAT'S

[Captioner] 19:43:57
 SO DIVERSE THAT ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO JUST CAME TO

[Captioner] 19:44:02
 THE COUNTRY FEEL VERY WELCOMED TO LIVE IN

[Captioner] 19:44:06
 SUCH A GOOD NEIGHBORHOOD.
NEEDLESS TO SAY THAT IN

[Captioner] 19:44:10
 TERMS OF OUR PARK FACILITIES AND ALL

[Captioner] 19:44:14
 THE OTHER FACILITIES, WE ARE PROUD TO

[Captioner] 19:44:19
 PROVIDE MUCH BETTER SERVICES TO OUR RESIDENTS.


[Captioner] 19:44:23
SO I'M VERY GLAD TO SEE THAT YEAR OF A YEAR, WE LOOK AT THE

[Captioner] 19:44:28
 PERFORMANCE OF THE RENT REVIEW BOARD AND

[Captioner] 19:44:32
 I FIND THE ACTIVE ROLE IT PLAYS IN KEEPING

[Captioner] 19:44:36
 THE HAPPY RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE RENTERS AND THE

[Captioner] 19:44:41
 LANDLORDS IS KEY TO THE RESULT THAT FREMONT IS STILL THE

[Captioner] 19:44:45
 HAPPIEST CITY IN THE UNITED STATES.
AND I WANT TO KEEP IT THAT WAY.


[Captioner] 19:44:53
I DON'T SEE RENT CONTROL IS A WAY, BECAUSE I'VE SEEN

[Captioner] 19:44:57
 SO MANY CASES WHERE STATISTICAL DATA

[Captioner] 19:45:01
 SHOW THAT ONCE A CITY APPLIES SUCH A RENT

[Captioner] 19:45:06
 CONTROL RESTRICTION, THEN THE

[Captioner] 19:45:11
 LOCAL HOUSING INDUSTRY OR THE BUILDING -- AND

[Captioner] 19:45:15
 ALL THE OTHER WOULD SUFFER AND DROP, AND IT A HIT TO THE

[Captioner] 19:45:19
 LOCAL ECONOMY.
ALSO,

[Captioner] 19:45:23
 CONSIDERING THAT IN FREMONT, WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT

[Captioner] 19:45:27
 MAJORITY OF THE LANDLORDS BEING THE SUPER RICH AND

[Captioner] 19:45:33
 DIRTY, SO-CALLED, COMPANIES

[Captioner] 19:45:37
 THAT WOULD JUST SUCK ALL THE BLOOD OF THE

[Captioner] 19:45:44
 RENTERS.
MORE CASES ARE THE MOM

[Captioner] 19:45:48
 AND POP LANDLORDS WHO RELY ON THE RENTAL

[Captioner] 19:45:54
 INCOME FOR THEIR LIVELIHOOD, AND THAT NEEDLESS TO SAY, THAT

[Captioner] 19:45:58
 THEIR LIVELIHOOD WAS HEAVILY AND ADVERSELY

[Captioner] 19:46:02
 IMPACTED DURING THE PANDEMIC OR THE

[Captioner] 19:46:07
 MORATORIUM, AND THERE'S STILL A LOT OF CASES

[Captioner] 19:46:11
 WHERE RENTERS, SOME RENTERS ARE TAKING ADVANTAGE

[Captioner] 19:46:15
 OF THE MORATORIUM, AND SO THE LANDLORD IS STILL

[Captioner] 19:46:20
 STRUGGLING IN THE LEGAL SYSTEM IN THOSE UNLAWFUL DETAINERS TO

[Captioner] 19:46:25
 TROY TO PROTECT THEIR RIGHTS.
SO I'M GLAD THAT THIS

[Captioner] 19:46:29
 CURRENT SYSTEM WORKS, THIS CURRENT SYSTEM PAYS ATTENTION TO

[Captioner] 19:46:33
 BOTH SIDE, AND THIS CURRENT SYSTEM ACTUALLY

[Captioner] 19:46:38
 CONTINUES TO WORK FOR THE COMMUNITY.
SO WITH

[Captioner] 19:46:43
 THAT, I KNOW I COMMENT ON THE HARD WORK OF THE STAFF,

[Captioner] 19:46:48
 AND ALSO SEE THAT WE'LL CONTINUE TO ONLY CHARGE THE

[Captioner] 19:46:53
 FEES TO LANDLORDS WHO HAVE FIVE OR MORE

[Captioner] 19:46:57
 UNITS, YOU KNOW, THOSE COMMERCIAL COMPANIES, WHILE STILL

[Captioner] 19:47:02
 PROTECTING THE RIGHTS OF THE -- I SAID A POP AND MOM -- YOU KNOW,

[Captioner] 19:47:06
 MOM AND POP LANDLORDS.


[Captioner] 19:47:10
SO I BELIEVE IN THE DATA, AND THE DATA

[Captioner] 19:47:14
 SHOWS THAT THE SYSTEM WORKS.
IF IT WORKS, WHY FIX IT?
SO THAT

[Captioner] 19:47:21
 IS MY EVALUATION, AND I

[Captioner] 19:47:25
 SUPPORT STAFF'S RECOMMENDATION TO INCREASE THE FEE

[Captioner] 19:47:32
 BY -- I

[Captioner] 19:47:36
 LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR HARD WORK IN THE FUTURE TO KEEP THE HAPPY RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN

[Captioner] 19:47:39
 THE RENTERS AND THE LANDLORDS.
THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:47:44
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN.
>> Councilmember Salwan: THANK YOU, MADAME

[Captioner] 19:47:48
 MAYOR, AND

[Captioner] 19:47:53
 -- I FORGOT YOUR LAST NAME.
>> LOPEZ.
>> Councilmember Salwan: LOPEZ.


[Captioner] 19:47:57
I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS AND ALSO THE REPORT.
SO WHAT IS THE ACTION BEFORE US?


[Captioner] 19:48:03
WHAT ARE WE SEEKING TO -- THE RECOMMENDATION?


[Captioner] 19:48:08
>> SO THE RECOMMENDATION IS TO INCREASE THE

[Captioner] 19:48:12
 RENT REVIEW ORDINANCE FEE FROM $13 TO $14 A UNIT.


[Captioner] 19:48:17
AND THAT'S FOR A COMPLETE COST RECOVERY OF THE RENT REVIEW ORDINANCE

[Captioner] 19:48:21
 PROGRAM.
>> Councilmember Salwan: AND THAT'S AN ACTION WE NEED TO TAKE EVERY YEAR?


[Captioner] 19:48:25
>> THAT'S CORRECT.
EVEN IF WE DIDN'T CHANGE THE FEE, WE WOULD HAVE TO

[Captioner] 19:48:29
 COME BACK AND SAY WE WANT TO KEEP THE FEE THE SAME FOR THAT SAME

[Captioner] 19:48:34
 YEAR.
>> Councilmember Salwan: THANK YOU.
WELL, IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU GUYS ARE

[Captioner] 19:48:39
 DOING A GOOD JOB AND FOR THE MOST PART, EVERYTHING IS

[Captioner] 19:48:43
 WORKING WELL, SO I SUPPORT INCREASING THE FEE.
>> Mayor Mei: SO YOU'RE

[Captioner] 19:48:46
 MAKING THE MOTION?
>> Councilmember Salwan: SURE, I'LL MAKE THE MOTION.


[Captioner] 19:48:50
>> Mayor Mei: MOTION BY COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN AND SICCED BY COUNCILMEMBER

[Captioner] 19:48:53
 COX.
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: THROUGH THE MAYOR.


[Captioner] 19:48:57
JUST TO BE CLEAR THAT THE ACTION INVOLVES NOT ONLY THE AUTHORITY TO INCREASE THE FEE

[Captioner] 19:49:02
 TO $14 PER UNIT, BUT ALSO ADOPT

[Captioner] 19:49:07
 THE RESOLUTION.
>> Councilmember Salwan: I'D LIKE TO MOVE THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION.


[Captioner] 19:49:10
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
SO WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND BY COUNCILMEMBER COX.


[Captioner] 19:49:15
COULD YOU PLEASE VOTE.


[Captioner] 19:49:16





[Captioner] 19:49:22
THANK YOU.
SO THE MOTION PASSES UNANIMOUSLY.
FROM THE COUNCIL.


[Captioner] 19:49:29
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:49:37
AND AT THIS TIME, I'D LIKE TO HAVE ANY REPORT OUTS ON

[Captioner] 19:49:41
 COMMITTEE ASSIGNMENTS FROM OUR COUNCILMEMBERS.


[Captioner] 19:49:50
SEEING NONE, AT THIS TIME, I'D LIKE TO PAUSE AND CLOSE IN A MOMENT OF

[Captioner] 19:49:55
 SILENCE, JUST FOR THE TREMENDOUS LOSS OF LIVES THESE LAST WEEKS.


[Captioner] 19:50:28
THANK YOU.
I'D LIKE TO JUST SAY THAT AS A MOTHER

[Captioner] 19:50:32
 AND AS COMMUNITY MEMBERS, I THINK WE HAVE SEEN

[Captioner] 19:50:36
 SOME OF THE HORRIFIC LOSS OF LIVES IN THESE LAST FEW WEEKS, AND

[Captioner] 19:50:40
 THAT AS A COMMUNITY, WHICH HAS

[Captioner] 19:50:45
 CELEBRATED SUCH DIVERSITY OF HERITAGE AND ETHNIC

[Captioner] 19:50:49
 BACKGROUNDS SUCH AS SOCIOECONOMIC, WE THEN WOULD PRAY FOR PEACE.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:50:54
AND THE MEETING IS ADJOURNED.
THANK YOU.
