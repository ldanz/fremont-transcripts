I'M HERE TONIGHT IN MY CAPACITY


[Captioner] 19:27:57
AS A COMMUNITY MEMBER AND AS A


[Captioner] 19:27:58
PARENT AND I JUST WANTED TO

THANK YOU FOR ALL OF THE


[Captioner] 19:28:02

[Captioner] 19:28:03

[Captioner] 19:28:04
COMMUNITY.


[Captioner] 19:28:06

THIS HAS BEEN A VERY, VERY


[Captioner] 19:28:15

[Captioner] 19:28:18
PARENT.


[Captioner] 19:28:21
MY OLDEST CAME OUT TO US OVER 10


[Captioner] 19:28:23
YEARS AGO, AND INITIALLY I WAS


[Captioner] 19:28:25
VERY, VERY AFRAID FOR THEIR


[Captioner] 19:28:26
SAFETY AND WHAT THEIR FUTURE


[Captioner] 19:28:27
WOULD BE LIKE.


[Captioner] 19:28:31
AND OVER THE YEARS, AS LAWS


[Captioner] 19:28:33
BECAME MORE PROTECTIVE, I BECAME


[Captioner] 19:28:36
LESS AFRAID, AND WATCHED MY


[Captioner] 19:28:37
CHILD BLOOM, AND IN THE LAST TWO


[Captioner] 19:28:39
YEARS, I'VE BECOME AFRAID


[Captioner] 19:28:39
AGAIN.


[Captioner] 19:28:41

THE FIRST LINE YOU SEE HERE IS


[Captioner] 19:44:32
THE PARKING CITATIONS/PERMIT


[Captioner] 19:44:32
REVENUE.


[Captioner] 19:44:37
THIS IS FROM FISCAL YEAR 2021 TO


[Captioner] 19:44:40

[Captioner] 19:44:41
REVENUE THAT CAME IN DURING THAT


[Captioner] 19:44:44

[Captioner] 19:45:21
ADDITIONAL 10 YEARS.


[Captioner] 19:45:22
CONTINUATION OF THIS PROGRAM


[Captioner] 19:45:23
BENEFITS THE RESIDENTS LIVING


[Captioner] 19:45:25
WITHIN THE EXISTING PARKING AREA


[Captioner] 19:45:26
CONSIDERING THE SIZE OF THE


[Captioner] 19:45:27
PERMIT PARKING AREA, THE


[Captioner] 19:45:29
RESTRICTED PARKING TIMES AND THE


[Captioner] 19:45:30
EXCESSIVE NUMBER OF


[Captioner] 19:45:31
NON-RESIDENTS THAT COME INTO THE


[Captioner] 19:45:32
NEIGHBORHOOD.


[Captioner] 19:45:43
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:45:45
AT THIS TIME, I'D LIKE TO SEE IF


[Captioner] 19:45:46
THERE ARE ANY CLARIFYING


[Captioner] 19:45:47
QUESTIONS FROM THE


[Captioner] 19:45:47
COUNCILMEMBERS.


[Captioner] 19:45:53
COUNCILMEMBER SHAO, PLEASE?


[Captioner] 19:45:55
>> Councilmember Shao: THANK


[Captioner] 19:45:55
YOU, MADAME MAYOR.


[Captioner] 19:45:56
I HAVE TWO QUESTIONS.


[Captioner] 19:45:58
THE FIRST ONE IS REGARDING THE


[Captioner] 19:45:59
ENFORCEMENT OF THE PARKING.


[Captioner] 19:46:04
MORE SPECIFICALLY, THE PRICE


[Captioner] 19:46:05
SETTING OF THE PARKING TICKET.


[Captioner] 19:46:08
I'VE HEARD IN THE PAST IN THE


[Captioner] 19:46:10
COMMUNITY WHERE PEOPLE COMPLAIN


[Captioner] 19:46:14
THAT THE PRICE SETTING FOR THE


[Captioner] 19:46:17
CITATION PROCESS WAS NOT


[Captioner] 19:46:18
TRANSPARENT ENOUGH, SO MANY OF


[Captioner] 19:46:23
THEM WERE TAKEN BY SURPRISE BY A


[Captioner] 19:46:26
SUDDEN INCREASE OF THE PARKING


[Captioner] 19:46:27
TICKET COST.


[Captioner] 19:46:29
SO WILL COULD YOU SHARE


[Captioner] 19:46:31
TYPICALLY WHAT KIND OF OUTREACH


[Captioner] 19:46:37
OR PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT THAT OUR


[Captioner] 19:46:38
PARKING ENFORCEMENT UNIT WOULD


[Captioner] 19:46:41
DO OR, MORE SPECIFICALLY, THE


[Captioner] 19:46:44
FPD WOULD DO TO ANNOUNCE ANY


[Captioner] 19:46:49
INCREASE OF THE PARKING TICKET


[Captioner] 19:46:50
FINE NUMBER ?L.


[Captioner] 19:46:57
>> SO THAT PROCESS,


[Captioner] 19:47:01
COUNCILMEMBER SHAO, THAT IS DONE


[Captioner] 19:47:01
THROUGH COUNCIL.


[Captioner] 19:47:06
AS FAR AS OUR TRANSPARENCY OF


[Captioner] 19:47:08
PRODUCING THAT DOCUMENT IS


[Captioner] 19:47:08
THROUGH COUNCIL APPROVAL.


[Captioner] 19:47:12
SO IT WOULD HAVE BEEN HERE IN


[Captioner] 19:47:14
THE PUBLIC HEARING, IS MY


[Captioner] 19:47:15
UNDERSTANDING.


[Captioner] 19:47:15
>> Councilmember Shao: OKAY.


[Captioner] 19:47:17
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:47:19
AND THE SECOND QUESTION I HAVE


[Captioner] 19:47:22
IS THAT I'VE GOT FEEDBACK FROM


[Captioner] 19:47:28
THE COMMUNITY WHERE SOME PEOPLE


[Captioner] 19:47:29
WANT TO NOT ONLY CONTINUE OR


[Captioner] 19:47:33
EXTEND THIS PROGRAM, BUT ALSO


[Captioner] 19:47:35
TO EXPLORE THE POSSIBILITY OF


[Captioner] 19:47:38
EXTENDING THE AREA TO INCLUDE


[Captioner] 19:47:39
THE ANTELOPE DRIVE.


[Captioner] 19:47:44
SO IN YOUR RESEARCH OR STUDY,


[Captioner] 19:47:48
DID YOU TAKE THAT INTO


[Captioner] 19:47:49
CONSIDERATION AND THEN IF YOU


[Captioner] 19:47:52
DON'T HAVE ANY PLAN TO EXTEND


[Captioner] 19:47:53
THIS PROGRAM, COULD YOU SHARE


[Captioner] 19:47:53
THE REASON?


[Captioner] 19:48:01
>> SO ANTELOPE DRIVE HAS NO


[Captioner] 19:48:01
RESIDENTS ALONG THAT LONG


[Captioner] 19:48:03
STRETCH OF ROADWAY FROM MISSION


[Captioner] 19:48:05
BOULEVARD UNTIL IT REACHES


[Captioner] 19:48:05
VINEYARD.


[Captioner] 19:48:09
AND IT'S LOW IMPACT TO


[Captioner] 19:48:09
THE RESIDENTS THERE.


[Captioner] 19:48:11
THERE'S NO DRIVEWAYS THAT IMPACT


[Captioner] 19:48:13
THE QUALITY OF LIFE.


[Captioner] 19:48:17
SO AT THIS TIME, WE DID NOT


[Captioner] 19:48:19
CONSIDER IT BUT IN THE FUTURE,


[Captioner] 19:48:20
WE COULD CONSIDER IF DEVELOPMENT


[Captioner] 19:48:21
CONTINUES IN THE AREA.


[Captioner] 19:48:21
>> Councilmember Shao: THANK


[Captioner] 19:48:21
YOU.


[Captioner] 19:48:27
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:48:28
ARE THERE ANY OTHER CLARIFYING


[Captioner] 19:48:29
QUESTIONS FROM THE COUNCIL?


[Captioner] 19:48:29
COUNCILMEMBER KENG.


[Captioner] 19:48:33
>> THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR, AND


[Captioner] 19:48:33
THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION.


[Captioner] 19:48:38
I'M JUST CURIOUS, SO EACH CAR


[Captioner] 19:48:39
ALONG THIS NEIGHBORHOOD, IF THEY


[Captioner] 19:48:41
WANT TO APPLY FOR A PERMIT, THEY


[Captioner] 19:48:43
ALSO NEED TO PAY THE FEE, IS


[Captioner] 19:48:43
THAT CORRECT?


[Captioner] 19:48:45
>> THAT'S CORRECT.


[Captioner] 19:48:46
>> Councilmember Keng: AND DO


[Captioner] 19:48:48
YOU HAVE THE INFORMATION ON WHAT


[Captioner] 19:48:49
KIND OF FEE THEY NEED TO PAY?


[Captioner] 19:48:50
IS IT PER CAR?


[Captioner] 19:48:51
>> IT IS PER CAR.


[Captioner] 19:48:53
IT IS APPROXIMATELY 3 TO $4 THAT


[Captioner] 19:48:55
THEY WILL PAY THROUGH THE THIRD


[Captioner] 19:48:55
PARTY CONTRACTOR.


[Captioner] 19:48:59
>> Councilmember Keng: GREAT,


[Captioner] 19:48:59
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:49:02
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:49:03
THAT'S THE LAST OF THE


[Captioner] 19:49:05
CLARIFYING QUESTIONS AT THIS


[Captioner] 19:49:05
TIME.


[Captioner] 19:49:08
I'D LIKE TO ENTERTAIN AND OPEN


[Captioner] 19:49:10
THE PUBLIC HEARING FOR QUESTIONS


[Captioner] 19:49:12
OR COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS OF THE


[Captioner] 19:49:13

THIS IS FOR THE MISSION PEAK


[Captioner] 19:49:41
NEIGHBORHOOD PERMIT PARKING


[Captioner] 19:49:42
PROGRAM.


[Captioner] 19:49:45
>> Ms. Gauthier: THE FIRST


[Captioner] 19:49:48

[Captioner] 19:49:50

[Captioner] 19:49:53

[Captioner] 19:49:55
THANKS FOR HEARING ME OUT.


[Captioner] 19:49:57
AS A LONG-STANDING MEMBER OF


[Captioner] 19:50:01
THIS COMMUNITY, I'M IN FULL


[Captioner] 19:50:02
AGREEMENT WITH WHAT THE


[Captioner] 19:50:03
LIEUTENANT SAID AND JUST WANT TO


[Captioner] 19:50:04
ECHO THOSE SAME THOUGHTS.


[Captioner] 19:50:05
IT CREATES A SAFER NEIGHBORHOOD,


[Captioner] 19:50:07
IT'S BEEN MUCH BETTER OVER THE


[Captioner] 19:50:08
LAST FEW YEARS, AND IT'S JUST --


[Captioner] 19:50:10
IT'S REALLY IMPERATIVE THAT WE


[Captioner] 19:50:12
CONTINUE TO CREATE THAT SAFE


[Captioner] 19:50:14
SPACE FOR -- I HAVE TWO YOUNG


[Captioner] 19:50:14
KIDS.


[Captioner] 19:50:19
IT JUST CREATES A MUCH BETTER,


[Captioner] 19:50:20
SAFER, CLEANER NEIGHBORHOOD FOR


[Captioner] 19:50:21
US AND WHEN YOU JUST FACTOR IN


[Captioner] 19:50:23
THAT IT'S SELF-FUNDED, NOT ONLY


[Captioner] 19:50:25
IS IT SELF-FUNDED BUT IT'S A


[Captioner] 19:50:27
REVENUE GENERATOR, I THINK IT'S


[Captioner] 19:50:28
KIND OF A NO-BRAINER.


[Captioner] 19:50:30
SO AS A MEMBER OF THAT


[Captioner] 19:50:31
COMMUNITY, I'M IN FULL AGREEMENT


[Captioner] 19:50:32

PEAK COST $82.


[Captioner] 19:50:46
THE PARKING TICKETS ELSEWHERE IN


[Captioner] 19:50:47
THE CITY COST 75.


[Captioner] 19:50:49
THE CITY NEVER EXPLAINED THAT


[Captioner] 19:50:50
THEY WERE GOING TO BE BOOSTING


[Captioner] 19:50:53
UP THE TICKETS BY JACKING UP THE


[Captioner] 19:50:55
PRICE BY 10% JUST FOR MISSION


[Captioner] 19:50:55
PEAK.


[Captioner] 19:50:58

WHY DID YOU HIDE THAT SPECIAL


[Captioner] 19:51:02
EXTRA PENALTY FOR MISSION PEAK


[Captioner] 19:51:03
PARKING TICKETS?


[Captioner] 19:51:07
AND THEN WHEN THE CITY HIRED


[Captioner] 19:51:10
THREE ADDITIONAL COMPLIANCE


[Captioner] 19:51:12
OFFICERS, THAT COST ABOUT


[Captioner] 19:51:13
$360,000 IN TOTAL COMPENSATION.


[Captioner] 19:51:19
AND IN 2019, THE CITY WAS


[Captioner] 19:51:20
DRAWING $430,000 FROM PARKING


[Captioner] 19:51:22
TICKETS, GROSS REVENUE,


[Captioner] 19:51:22
CITY-WIDE.


[Captioner] 19:51:23
430.


[Captioner] 19:51:25
DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH WE MADE


[Captioner] 19:51:25
LAST YEAR?


[Captioner] 19:51:28
IT WAS $530,000.


[Captioner] 19:51:31
SO YOU'RE MAKING $100,000 EXTRA


[Captioner] 19:51:36
IN PARKING TICKETS AND PAYING


[Captioner] 19:51:37
$360,000 IN SALARY.


[Captioner] 19:51:41
SO WE'RE WHAT, BEHIND BY


[Captioner] 19:51:41
$260,000.


[Captioner] 19:51:45
THIS IS A TRAGEDY, A WASTE.


[Captioner] 19:51:49
>> Ms. Gauthier: NEXT SPEAKER


[Captioner] 19:51:50
ON ZOOM IS VP.


[Captioner] 19:51:59
>> THANKS FOR LETTING ME SPEAK.


[Captioner] 19:52:03
I AM IN SUPPORT OF CONTINUING


[Captioner] 19:52:06
THIS PROGRAM FOR THE NEXT 10


[Captioner] 19:52:08
YEARS AS PROPOSED BY THE POLICE


[Captioner] 19:52:08
DEPARTMENT.


[Captioner] 19:52:13
THE SYSTEM IS WORKING, AND IT


[Captioner] 19:52:14
HAS SOMEWHAT MITIGATED THE


[Captioner] 19:52:16
PROBLEMS THAT WE HAD IN THE


[Captioner] 19:52:19
PAST, AND I WOULD FULLY SUPPORT


[Captioner] 19:52:21
CONTINUING THIS FOR THE NEXT 10


[Captioner] 19:52:21
YEARS.


[Captioner] 19:52:22
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:52:24
>> Ms. Gauthier: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:52:26
WE'RE GOING TO GO TO THE SPEAK


[Captioner] 19:52:27
ARES THAT ARE IN PERSON.


[Captioner] 19:52:33
STAN YEI, FOLLOWED BY WILLIAM


[Captioner] 19:52:33
HSU.


[Captioner] 19:52:39
>> THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME THE


[Captioner] 19:52:41
CHANCE TO TALK.


[Captioner] 19:52:42
>> Mayor Mei: SORRY, YOU MAY


[Captioner] 19:52:43
WANT TO TURN THE MIC.


[Captioner] 19:52:44
>> TURN THIS WAY, PLEASE.


[Captioner] 19:52:45
>> CAN YOU HEAR ME?


[Captioner] 19:52:46
>> Ms. Gauthier: FACE THE


[Captioner] 19:52:46
COUNCIL, PLEASE.


[Captioner] 19:52:48
>> Mayor Mei: ACTUALLY I


[Captioner] 19:52:49
APOLOGIZE, IF YOU WANT TO TURN


[Captioner] 19:52:50
THE MIC BACK TO THE DIRECTION TO


[Captioner] 19:52:52
FACE US, THAT MIGHT BE EASIER


[Captioner] 19:52:53
FOR US TO SEE YOU.


[Captioner] 19:52:54
>> OKAY, GOOD.


[Captioner] 19:52:55
THANK YOU FOR THE CHANCE TO


[Captioner] 19:52:56
TALK.


[Captioner] 19:53:00
I WILL TALK BASICALLY FOR THE


[Captioner] 19:53:04
BENEFIT OF THE MTC FOLLOWERS.


[Captioner] 19:53:06
THERE ARE TWO FALSE CLAIMS.


[Captioner] 19:53:08
CLAIM ONE, HOMEOWNERS SHOULD


[Captioner] 19:53:11
HAVE BEEN PREPARED FOR THE HIKER


[Captioner] 19:53:11
CROWD.


[Captioner] 19:53:12
THE PARK WAS HERE BEFORE HOMES


[Captioner] 19:53:13
WERE BUILT.


[Captioner] 19:53:15
IT'S HALF TRUTH.


[Captioner] 19:53:18
 -- CONSTRUCTION BEGAN IN 1996


[Captioner] 19:53:19
AND COMPLETED IN 1998.


[Captioner] 19:53:23
TRI-CITY GAVE IT PROMOTION


[Captioner] 19:53:25
AROUND 2007.


[Captioner] 19:53:30
>> Ms. Gauthier: YOU HAVE


[Captioner] 19:53:30
28 SECONDS LEFT.


[Captioner] 19:53:35
>> AND THE PARKING ISSUE BECAME


[Captioner] 19:53:36
A REAL ISSUE IN 2014.


[Captioner] 19:53:42
THE SECOND IS WHY NOT OPEN --


[Captioner] 19:53:44
FOR PUBLIC PARKING, IT WAS BUILT


[Captioner] 19:53:48
BY A BUILDER FOR THE VINTAGE


[Captioner] 19:53:48
GROVE RESIDENTS.


[Captioner] 19:53:50
THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT ARTERY


[Captioner] 19:53:51
FOR THE RESIDENTS.


[Captioner] 19:53:56
WE CANNOT LET IT BECOME A PUBLIC


[Captioner] 19:53:57
PARKING SPOT.


[Captioner] 19:53:58
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:54:01
>> Ms. Gauthier: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:54:04
THE NEXT SPEAKER IS WILLIAM


[Captioner] 19:54:04
HSU.


[Captioner] 19:54:08
FOLLOWED BY SAN JAY.


[Captioner] 19:54:14
>> GOOD EVENING.


[Captioner] 19:54:17
MY NAME IS WILLIAM HSU, LONG


[Captioner] 19:54:19
TIME RESIDENT OF VINEYARD


[Captioner] 19:54:19
AVENUE.


[Captioner] 19:54:25
I THINK THE PROGRAM IS WORKING


[Captioner] 19:54:26
FOR MOST PART OF THE AREA.


[Captioner] 19:54:27
THE EXCEPTION IS ON VINEYARD


[Captioner] 19:54:28
AVENUE.


[Captioner] 19:54:28
WHERE I LIVE.


[Captioner] 19:54:31
IT REMAINS PROBLEMATIC.


[Captioner] 19:54:37
I THINK ONE OF THE PROBLEMS IS


[Captioner] 19:54:40
THE SIGNPOST IS NOT CLEAR


[Captioner] 19:54:40
ENOUGH.


[Captioner] 19:54:46
IT SHOWS THE AVAILABILITY OF


[Captioner] 19:54:47
PARKING ON VINEYARD AVENUE.


[Captioner] 19:54:50
WHERE PART OF IT IS RESTRICTED.


[Captioner] 19:54:53
AND THE SECOND ONE IS THE


[Captioner] 19:54:55
ENFORCEMENT IS NOT FULLY


[Captioner] 19:54:56
EFFICIENT.


[Captioner] 19:54:59
AND THE PARKING OFFICERS


[Captioner] 19:55:02
NORMALLY WILL RESPOND TO OUR


[Captioner] 19:55:04
CALL ONE TIME EACH DAY AT MOST.


[Captioner] 19:55:07
AS A RESULT, STILL MANY


[Captioner] 19:55:08
VIOLATIONS STILL GET AWAY.


[Captioner] 19:55:15
SO THOSE VISITORS ARE NOT


[Captioner] 19:55:17
RECEIVING A CITATION, THEN THIS


[Captioner] 19:55:17
PROBLEM WILL CONTINUE.


[Captioner] 19:55:21
>> Ms. Gauthier: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:55:22
SANJAY.


[Captioner] 19:55:24
AND THERE'S A CARD FROM JOANN


[Captioner] 19:55:26
BUT I CAN'T READ WHAT THIS


[Captioner] 19:55:26
SAYS.


[Captioner] 19:55:28
IT SAYS SOMETHING PARKING.


[Captioner] 19:55:30
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S FOR THIS


[Captioner] 19:55:30
ITEM.


[Captioner] 19:55:34
OKAY.


[Captioner] 19:55:36
SORRY.


[Captioner] 19:55:37
>> GOOD EVENING.


[Captioner] 19:55:39
I SUPPORT THIS MOTION TO EXTEND


[Captioner] 19:55:40
IT FOR 10 YEARS.


[Captioner] 19:55:41
I HOWEVER HAVE A SUGGESTION.


[Captioner] 19:55:44
I LIVE ON BOAR CIRCLE,


[Captioner] 19:55:45
SUGGESTION TO MODIFY IT SLIGHTLY


[Captioner] 19:55:47
AND THAT IS TO STOP TO HAVE IT


[Captioner] 19:55:51
FROM MIDNIGHT ON SATURDAY TO


[Captioner] 19:55:52
ABOUT 2:00 OR 3:00, WHICH IS


[Captioner] 19:55:54
WHEN MOST OF THE PEOPLE AT


[Captioner] 19:55:55
MISSION PEAK HAVE GONE, OKAY,


[Captioner] 19:55:56
AND DO THE SAME THING ON


[Captioner] 19:55:56
SUNDAY.


[Captioner] 19:55:58
THE REASON BEING THAT IT IS


[Captioner] 19:56:00
ACTUALLY A LOT OF WORK ON EVERY


[Captioner] 19:56:01
SINGLE WEEKEND IF SOMEBODY


[Captioner] 19:56:03
VISITS YOU TO GO AND TAKE THE


[Captioner] 19:56:05
PARKING TOKEN THAT I HAVE TO PUT


[Captioner] 19:56:09
IN THE CAR AND WHEN THEY LEAVE,


[Captioner] 19:56:10
THE GUEST LEAVES TO REMEMBER TO


[Captioner] 19:56:10
TAKE IT BACK.


[Captioner] 19:56:12
SO IT'S QUITE A BIT OF NUISANCE


[Captioner] 19:56:14
AND IT'S EVERY SINGLE


[Captioner] 19:56:14
SATURDAY/SUNDAY.


[Captioner] 19:56:16
IF YOU MODIFIED SLIGHTLY TO STOP


[Captioner] 19:56:18
AROUND 2, 3, 4, 5:00, THEN


[Captioner] 19:56:19
NOBODY IS GOING TO MISSION PEAK


[Captioner] 19:56:21
WHICH I ALSO BELIEVE CLOSES AT


[Captioner] 19:56:21
6:00.


[Captioner] 19:56:23
SO THAT'S THE MODIFICATION.


[Captioner] 19:56:25
THE SECOND THING I SUGGEST IS TO


[Captioner] 19:56:27
ACTUALLY PUT PARKING -- PAID


[Captioner] 19:56:30
PARKING ON ANTELOPE AND SO IT


[Captioner] 19:56:31
WILL GENERATE MORE REVENUE FOR


[Captioner] 19:56:32
THE CITY AND MAYBE ENCOURAGE


[Captioner] 19:56:34
PEOPLE TO GO TO OHLONE AND


[Captioner] 19:56:35
GENERATE REVENUE FOR OHLONE.


[Captioner] 19:56:37
SO I SUGGEST YOU MAKE THOSE TWO


[Captioner] 19:56:38
CHANGES IF YOU MAKE THE


[Captioner] 19:56:40
MODIFICATION TO END AT 2:00 OR


[Captioner] 19:56:40
3:00.


[Captioner] 19:56:41
>> Ms. Gauthier: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:56:44
WE DON'T HAVE ANY CARDS IN


[Captioner] 19:56:44
PERSON.


[Captioner] 19:56:46
WE HAVE SEVERAL HANDS IN ZOOM.


[Captioner] 19:56:52
THE NEXT SPEAKER IS NARESH


[Captioner] 19:56:52
SINGHAL.


[Captioner] 19:56:53
>> HI.


[Captioner] 19:56:56
I WOULD LIKE TO FOLLOW UP ON THE


[Captioner] 19:56:58
SECOND QUESTION THAT


[Captioner] 19:57:00
COUNCILMEMBER SHAO ASKED ON


[Captioner] 19:57:02
EXTENDING THE PARKING PERMIT


[Captioner] 19:57:04
AREA TO ANTELOPE DRIVE.


[Captioner] 19:57:06
AND THE POLICE OFFICER RESPONDED


[Captioner] 19:57:08
THAT THERE ARE NO RESIDENTS


[Captioner] 19:57:11
ALONG THAT ROAD, BUT IF YOU WERE


[Captioner] 19:57:14
TO GO ON ANTELOPE DRIVE ON A


[Captioner] 19:57:15
SATURDAY MORNING OR A SUNDAY


[Captioner] 19:57:17
MORNING, YOU'LL SEE HOW CRAZY


[Captioner] 19:57:18
THE TRAFFIC IS.


[Captioner] 19:57:22
PEOPLE WAITING ON OTHER CARS


[Captioner] 19:57:24
COMING OUT IS JUST A CRAZY


[Captioner] 19:57:27
SCENARIO AND UNSAFE FOR THE


[Captioner] 19:57:28
NEIGHBORHOOD VEHICLES TO GO IN


[Captioner] 19:57:30
AND OUT OF ANTELOPE DRIVE OR ANY


[Captioner] 19:57:32
OF THE OTHER SIDE STREETS.


[Captioner] 19:57:36
SO I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THAT


[Captioner] 19:57:38
WE CONSIDER EXTENDING THE


[Captioner] 19:57:40
PARKING PERMIT PROGRAM TO THE


[Captioner] 19:57:44
ANTELOPE DRIEFL TO MAKE IT MORE


[Captioner] 19:57:44
EFFECTIVE.


[Captioner] 19:57:44
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:57:46
>> Ms. Gauthier: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:57:49
THE NEXT SPEAKER IS SUBROTO.


[Captioner] 19:57:56
>> HELLO, CAN YOU HEAR ME?


[Captioner] 19:57:58
>> Ms. Gauthier: YES.


[Captioner] 19:57:58
>> HI.


[Captioner] 19:58:02
MY NAME IS SUBROTO.


[Captioner] 19:58:06
I LIVE IN VINEYARD HILLS AND I'M


[Captioner] 19:58:07
CURRENTLY -- I CURRENTLY SERVE


[Captioner] 19:58:09
AS THE PRESIDENT OF THE HOA.


[Captioner] 19:58:13
WE HAVE 384 MEMBERS AND ALL OUR


[Captioner] 19:58:16
MEMBERS FALL UNDER THIS MISSION


[Captioner] 19:58:16
PEAK PARKING AREA.


[Captioner] 19:58:18
ON BEHALF OF THE VINEYARD HILLS


[Captioner] 19:58:20
COMMUNITY AND A RESIDENT IN


[Captioner] 19:58:21
THIS NEIGHBORHOOD, I AM SPEAKING


[Captioner] 19:58:24
TO EXPRESS STRONG SUPPORT FOR


[Captioner] 19:58:25
EXTENDING THE MISSION PEAK


[Captioner] 19:58:26
NEIGHBORHOOD PERMIT PARKING


[Captioner] 19:58:26
PROGRAM.


[Captioner] 19:58:29
THIS PROGRAM HAS MADE A POSITIVE


[Captioner] 19:58:30
DIFFERENCE TO THE RESIDENTS IN


[Captioner] 19:58:32
OUR COMMUNITY DEALING WITH


[Captioner] 19:58:34
NUISANCE PARKING ACTIVITY BY


[Captioner] 19:58:35
DEALING WITH VISITORS AND HIKERS


[Captioner] 19:58:37
AND BLOCKING DRIVEWAYS ON


[Captioner] 19:58:38
WEEKENDS AND HOLIDAYS.


[Captioner] 19:58:41
IT'S MADE A BIG DIFFERENCE IN


[Captioner] 19:58:43
REDUCING TRASH ON THE STREETS.


[Captioner] 19:58:44
WE APPRECIATE THE HARD WORK DONE


[Captioner] 19:58:47
BY THE CSO AND OUR COLLEAGUES IN


[Captioner] 19:58:49
ENFORCING THESE RESTRICTIONS


[Captioner] 19:58:49
EVERY WEEKEND AND OUR COMMUNITY


[Captioner] 19:58:52
WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE


[Captioner] 19:58:53
ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITY AS PART OF


[Captioner] 19:58:53
THE EXTENSION.


[Captioner] 19:58:56
WE LOOK FORWARD TO A PRODUCTIVE


[Captioner] 19:58:58
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE


[Captioner] 19:59:02
ORGANIZATIONS AND THAT'S --


[Captioner] 19:59:03

WHILE IN THE 10-PLUS YEARS --


[Captioner] 19:59:15
CAN YOU HEAR ME?


[Captioner] 19:59:16
SORRY?


[Captioner] 19:59:17
>> Ms. Gauthier: YES.


[Captioner] 19:59:17
>> OKAY.


[Captioner] 19:59:19
WELL, IN THE 10 PAST YEARS, THE


[Captioner] 19:59:21
PARK DISTRICT IS DOING VERY


[Captioner] 19:59:22
LITTLE TO NOTHING TO ADDRESS THE


[Captioner] 19:59:24
HUGE CROWD GOING INTO THE PARK


[Captioner] 19:59:25
THROUGH THIS SINGLE ENTRANCE AT


[Captioner] 19:59:26
STANFORD.


[Captioner] 19:59:27
THE CITY OF FREMONT HAS TAKEN A


[Captioner] 19:59:30
MUCH NEEDED BOLD STEP IN THE


[Captioner] 19:59:31
RIGHT DIRECTION TO PROTECT THE


[Captioner] 19:59:33
WELL-BEING OF AREA RESIDENTS.


[Captioner] 19:59:37
OTHERWISE SUFFERING FROM EFFECTS


[Captioner] 19:59:39
OF UNMANAGED HUGE CROWD THROUGH


[Captioner] 19:59:39
THIS ENTRANCE.


[Captioner] 19:59:42
THE PUBLIC PARKING PROGRAM SINCE


[Captioner] 19:59:44
2016 HAS AT LEAST RESTORED TO US


[Captioner] 19:59:45
SOME NORMALCY IN OUR OWN HOMES.


[Captioner] 19:59:47
RESIDENTS ARE ONLY ASKING FOR


[Captioner] 19:59:50
SOME PEACE AND SAFETY ON THE


[Captioner] 19:59:52
WEEKENDS AND HOLIDAYS, WHEN THE


[Captioner] 19:59:53
CROWDS ARE ESPECIALLY HUGE.


[Captioner] 19:59:55
THIS IS NOT TOO MUCH TO ASK


[Captioner] 19:59:55
FOR.


[Captioner] 19:59:58
WE WELCOME THE RECOMMENDATION OF


[Captioner] 19:59:59
FREMONT POLICE TO EXTEND THE


[Captioner] 20:00:01
PROGRAM FOR ANOTHER 10 YEARS AND


[Captioner] 20:00:01
COUNCIL'S APPROVAL.


[Captioner] 20:00:02
THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 20:00:10
ONHSU.


[Captioner] 20:00:10
>> HI.


[Captioner] 20:00:13
THANK YOU, COUNCILMEMBERS, FOR


[Captioner] 20:00:14
LETTING ME SPEAK.


[Captioner] 20:00:16
SO I'VE BEEN IN THIS


[Captioner] 20:00:18
NEIGHBORHOOD FOR WELL BEFORE AND


[Captioner] 20:00:20
AFTER THE PERMITS, AND I CAN SAY


[Captioner] 20:00:23
THAT IT WORKING BECAUSE BEFORE,


[Captioner] 20:00:24
IT WAS INCREDIBLY NOISY.


[Captioner] 20:00:28
MY WIFE AND I ARE HEALTHCARE


[Captioner] 20:00:28
PROFESSIONALS, WE WORK VERY


[Captioner] 20:00:31
OFTEN ON THE WEEKENDS AND THERE


[Captioner] 20:00:33
ARE OFTEN MANY TIMES WE'RE WOKEN


[Captioner] 20:00:35
UP AT 5:00, 6:00 A.M. IN THE


[Captioner] 20:00:37
MORNING, AND WE NEED OUR REST,


[Captioner] 20:00:38
WE'VE GOT TO GO TO WORK, WE'VE


[Captioner] 20:00:39
GOT LIVES TO SAVE.


[Captioner] 20:00:41
NOT ONLY IS IT NOISY, IT'S


[Captioner] 20:00:42
DIRTY, WHERE THERE IS PERMIT


[Captioner] 20:00:43
PARKING RIGHT NOW.


[Captioner] 20:00:44
I VERY OFTEN GO WALKING AROUND


[Captioner] 20:00:47
THE NEIGHBORHOOD WITH MY YOUNG


[Captioner] 20:00:47
DAUGHTER.


[Captioner] 20:00:50
WHERE CARS ARE ALLOWED TO PARK


[Captioner] 20:00:52
FOR FREE ON ANTELOPE AND


[Captioner] 20:00:53
VINEYARD, THERE'S ALWAYS


[Captioner] 20:00:53
GARBAGE.


[Captioner] 20:00:56
I OFTEN SEE BEER BOTTLE, EMPTY


[Captioner] 20:00:56
BEER BOTTLES.


[Captioner] 20:01:02
I OFTEN SEE FLYERS THAT THE


[Captioner] 20:01:04
CONSERVANCY GROUP IS PUTTING ON


[Captioner] 20:01:05
PEOPLE'S CARS AND IT JUST A


[Captioner] 20:01:06
NUISANCE.


[Captioner] 20:01:07
NOT ONLY THAT, IT BRINGS IN MORE


[Captioner] 20:01:07
CRIME.


[Captioner] 20:01:09
ONE THING ABOUT THE PARKING ON


[Captioner] 20:01:11
WEIBEL, I DON'T RECOMMEND THAT


[Captioner] 20:01:13
BECAUSE PEOPLE SPEED ON STANFORD


[Captioner] 20:01:17
WHERE THERE'S ALREADY --


[Captioner] 20:01:19
>> Ms. Gauthier: THE NEXT


[Captioner] 20:01:22
SPEAKER IS ASOK CHATTERJEE.


[Captioner] 20:01:23
>> CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW?


[Captioner] 20:01:24
>> Ms. Gauthier: YES.


[Captioner] 20:01:29
>> I THINK THIS PROGRAM IS


[Captioner] 20:01:31
REALLY A GOD SEND TO ALL THE


[Captioner] 20:01:34
RESIDENTS OF THIS WIDE AREA.


[Captioner] 20:01:35
IT HAS WORKED VERY WELL.


[Captioner] 20:01:42
IT BROUGHT SANITY TO THE OVERALL


[Captioner] 20:01:42
SITUATION.


[Captioner] 20:01:42
IT WORKING.


[Captioner] 20:01:47
IT'S -- IT'S GETTING THE


[Captioner] 20:01:50
BLESSING OF EVERYBODY AROUND THE


[Captioner] 20:01:50
AREA.


[Captioner] 20:01:51
IT SHOULD BE CONTINUING.


[Captioner] 20:01:55
IF EVER YOU WANT TO MAKE ANY


[Captioner] 20:01:57
CHANGES, IT SHOULD BE ACTUALLY


[Captioner] 20:02:03
EXPANDED, NOT CONTRACTED, SO


[Captioner] 20:02:06
THAT THE PEOPLE ON ANTELOPE AND


[Captioner] 20:02:09
VINEYARD, THEY HAVE ALSO THE


[Captioner] 20:02:16
ADVANTAGE OF THE PARKING


[Captioner] 20:02:16
RESTRICTIONS.


[Captioner] 20:02:18
MY HEART REALLY GOES OUT FOR THE


[Captioner] 20:02:19
PEOPLE WHOSE HOUSES ARE ON


[Captioner] 20:02:19
ANTELOPE.


[Captioner] 20:02:21
THERE ARE TOO MANY CARS THAT


[Captioner] 20:02:22
DRIVE TOO FAST.


[Captioner] 20:02:22
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:02:25
>> Ms. Gauthier: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:02:29
THE NEXT SPEAKER IS TONY


[Captioner] 20:02:29
HISPANIC.


[Captioner] 20:02:33
 PANG.


[Captioner] 20:02:35
>> I'M IN FAVOR OF EXTENDING THE


[Captioner] 20:02:36
PARKING PERMIT PROGRAM FOR


[Captioner] 20:02:36
ANOTHER 10 YEARS.


[Captioner] 20:02:46
THE MERCURY NEWS COLUMNIST --


[Captioner] 20:02:46
SAID IT'S EASY.


[Captioner] 20:02:48
OBEY TRAFFIC LAWS AND DON'T


[Captioner] 20:02:48
WORRY ABOUT FINES.


[Captioner] 20:02:53
FINES ARE A PENALTY FOR FAILURE


[Captioner] 20:02:54
TO FOLLOW RULES.


[Captioner] 20:02:57
IF YOU CAN AFFORD A CAR AND THE


[Captioner] 20:02:58
INSENSITIVITY TO PARKING IN A


[Captioner] 20:03:00
RESTRICTED AREA, YOU CAN AFFORD


[Captioner] 20:03:00
THE FINE.


[Captioner] 20:03:03
A LAND WITHOUT PUNISHMENT SIMPLY


[Captioner] 20:03:04
DOES NOT WORK.


[Captioner] 20:03:06
THE TALK OF FINES AND


[Captioner] 20:03:08
RETRIBUTIONS SOUNDED LIKE AS


[Captioner] 20:03:11
SOMEONE IS ASKING FOR PUBLIC


[Captioner] 20:03:11
FLOGGING.


[Captioner] 20:03:13
DO YOU NOT BELIEVE IN THE IDEA


[Captioner] 20:03:14
OF FINE AS A DETERRENT?


[Captioner] 20:03:15
I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW PEOPLE


[Captioner] 20:03:19
FAIL TO SEE THE TERRIBLE


[Captioner] 20:03:20
INCONVENIENCE TO THE HOMEOWNERS


[Captioner] 20:03:22
WHO ARE TRYING TO HAVE A RESTFUL


[Captioner] 20:03:22
WEEKEND.


[Captioner] 20:03:24
I BELIEVE A STRONGER ENFORCEMENT


[Captioner] 20:03:28
OF THE PERMIT PARKING PROGRAM


[Captioner] 20:03:29
WILL BRING RELIEF AND CALMNESS


[Captioner] 20:03:29
BACK TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD.


[Captioner] 20:03:30
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:03:31
>> Ms. Gauthier: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:03:33
THE NEXT SPEAKER IS INKI.


[Captioner] 20:03:37

[Captioner] 20:03:39
THANK YOU, CAN YOU HEAR ME?


[Captioner] 20:03:43
THANK YOU, MAYOR MEI AND CITY


[Captioner] 20:03:44
COUNCILMEMBERS, FOR THE


[Captioner] 20:03:44

[Captioner] 20:03:45
>> Ms. Gauthier: YES.


[Captioner] 20:03:48
>> OKAY.


[Captioner] 20:03:53
THANK YOU TO FREMONT POLICE FOR


[Captioner] 20:03:54
CONTINUATION OF THE PERMIT


[Captioner] 20:03:56
PARKING WHICH HAS BEEN A SUCCESS


[Captioner] 20:03:58
AND SHOULD BE RENEWED FOR THE


[Captioner] 20:03:58
NEXT 10 YEARS.


[Captioner] 20:04:00
PERMIT PARKING ALSO SHOULD BE


[Captioner] 20:04:05
IMPLEMENTED AT


[Captioner] 20:04:07
ANTELOPE DRIVE ESPECIALLY TO THE


[Captioner] 20:04:10
COMMUNITY OF 100-PLUS HOMES.


[Captioner] 20:04:12
A THOUSAND CARS LINED UP AND


[Captioner] 20:04:13
HIKERS BLOCKING AROUND THESE


[Captioner] 20:04:13
STREETS.


[Captioner] 20:04:19
AND ALSO DURING AN EVACUATION


[Captioner] 20:04:21
PLAN, DURING ANY FIRES OR


[Captioner] 20:04:23
EARTHQUAKE AND THE HOT SUMMER IS


[Captioner] 20:04:28
COMING UP, ANY PLAN FOR --


[Captioner] 20:04:29
SHOULD HAPPEN AT THE BEGINNING


[Captioner] 20:04:31
OF THE FIRE SEASON AND DO YOU


[Captioner] 20:04:35
HAVE ANYTHING PLANNED,


[Captioner] 20:04:36
EVACUATION PLAN WITH SO MANY


[Captioner] 20:04:39
THOUSANDS OF CARS LINED UP ON


[Captioner] 20:04:39
THE STREETS?

>> Ms. Gauthier: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:04:46
NEXT SPEAKER IS HARI


[Captioner] 20:04:46
JOBANPUTRA.


[Captioner] 20:04:51
>> HI.


[Captioner] 20:04:53
THIS IS HARI.


[Captioner] 20:04:55
I HAVE BEEN LIVING ON STANFORD


[Captioner] 20:04:57
FOR THE LAST 10-PLUS YEARS, AND


[Captioner] 20:05:00
I AM IN SUPPORT OF EXTENDING


[Captioner] 20:05:04
THIS PARKING PERMIT FOR 10 OR


[Captioner] 20:05:07
MAYBE -- YEARS, THIS IS


[Captioner] 20:05:09
SOMETHING THAT HAS GIVEN US A


[Captioner] 20:05:10
PEACE AS WELL AS OUR RESIDENCES


[Captioner] 20:05:10
BACK TO OURSELVES.


[Captioner] 20:05:16
WITHOUT THIS PERMIT, OUR STREETS


[Captioner] 20:05:20
WERE REALLY FLOODED WITH GARBAGE


[Captioner] 20:05:27
AND ALSO -- HI, THIS IS HARI.


[Captioner] 20:05:29
STORY, I COULDN'T UNMUTE


[Captioner] 20:05:29
MYSELF.


[Captioner] 20:05:32
I WILL REPEAT AGAIN, I LIVE ON


[Captioner] 20:05:35
STANFORD AVENUE AND I SUPPORT


[Captioner] 20:05:38
THIS PROGRAM FOR 10 OR INFINITE


[Captioner] 20:05:38
YEARS.


[Captioner] 20:05:43
WITHOUT THIS PROGRAM, WE WILL


[Captioner] 20:05:46
HAVE -- WE WOULD HAVE BEEN IN


[Captioner] 20:05:48
A -- OF GARBAGE AND A LOT OF


[Captioner] 20:05:49
OTHER NUISANCE.


[Captioner] 20:05:49
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:05:51
>> Ms. Gauthier: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:05:53
THE NEXT SPEAKER IS SURESH.


[Captioner] 20:06:05
>> THIS IS IS THE URESH.


[Captioner] 20:06:07
IT'S INTERESTING THAT THE CITY


[Captioner] 20:06:10
COUNCIL HAS CONTINUED TO FAVOR A


[Captioner] 20:06:12
PARTICULAR NEIGHBORHOOD AT THE


[Captioner] 20:06:13
EXPENSE OF ALL OTHER


[Captioner] 20:06:13
NEIGHBORHOODS IN THE CITY.


[Captioner] 20:06:15
I LIVE NEAR GOMES SCHOOL AND


[Captioner] 20:06:16
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME TO GET IN


[Captioner] 20:06:18
AND OUT OF MY DRIVEWAY.


[Captioner] 20:06:21
EVERY DAY WHEN THE SCHOOL HOURS


[Captioner] 20:06:24
FROM 8:00 TO 8:30, 8:45 IN THE


[Captioner] 20:06:25
MORNING, AND AGAIN IN THE


[Captioner] 20:06:26
AFTERNOON, AND ON THE WEEKEND,


[Captioner] 20:06:30
OF COURSE, THERE IS THE BASEBALL


[Captioner] 20:06:32
GOING ON WITH LOUDSPEAKERS ON.


[Captioner] 20:06:33
PEOPLE TALK ABOUT SLEEPING?


[Captioner] 20:06:35
I CANNOT EVEN HAVE A


[Captioner] 20:06:37
CONVERSATION IN THE DAY TIME


[Captioner] 20:06:40
WITH MY GUESTS, I CANNOT SIT


[Captioner] 20:06:41
OUTSIDE, SO I DON'T UNDERSTAND


[Captioner] 20:06:44
WHAT IS THE LOGIC OR RATIONALE


[Captioner] 20:06:46
BEHIND SPENDING HALF A MILLION


[Captioner] 20:06:49
 DOLLARS A YEAR ONLY FOR


[Captioner] 20:06:50
THE STANFORD NEIGHBORHOOD AND


[Captioner] 20:06:52
LET THE REST OF THE CITY SUFFER


[Captioner] 20:06:53
THROUGH THE SAME KIND OF


[Captioner] 20:06:56
NUISANCE THAT THE STANFORD


[Captioner] 20:06:56
NEIGHBORHOOD PEOPLE ARE


[Captioner] 20:06:56
COMPLAINING ABOUT?


[Captioner] 20:06:58
TOTALLY IRRATIONAL.


[Captioner] 20:06:58
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:07:01
>> Ms. Gauthier: THE NEXT


[Captioner] 20:07:03
SPEAKER IS PRAKOON CHEN.


[Captioner] 20:07:07
>> YES.


[Captioner] 20:07:11
THANK YOU FOR THE TIME FOR ME TO


[Captioner] 20:07:11
SPEAK.


[Captioner] 20:07:16
I'D LIKE TO EXPRESS MY SUPPORT


[Captioner] 20:07:18
FOR THE EXTENDING OF THE


[Captioner] 20:07:18
PROGRAM.


[Captioner] 20:07:20
I LIVE AT HIDDEN VALLEY, WHICH


[Captioner] 20:07:22
IS TO THE SOUTH OF THE STANFORD


[Captioner] 20:07:22
AREA.


[Captioner] 20:07:25
WE HAVE ABOUT 18 HOMES IN THIS


[Captioner] 20:07:26
AREA.


[Captioner] 20:07:28
I REMEMBER BEFORE THE PARKING


[Captioner] 20:07:29
PERMIT WAS PUT IN, STANFORD


[Captioner] 20:07:31
AVENUE, WHEN YOU TRY TO DRIVE


[Captioner] 20:07:33
DOWN, WAS JUST A MESS WITH CARS


[Captioner] 20:07:36
PARKING ALONG ALL THE SIDES OF


[Captioner] 20:07:37
THE STANFORD.


[Captioner] 20:07:39
THE OTHER SPEAKER ALSO MENTIONED


[Captioner] 20:07:41
THAT MISSION PEAK PARK CLOSES AT


[Captioner] 20:07:41
6:00 P.M.


[Captioner] 20:07:43
I'D LIKE TO CORRECT THAT, IT


[Captioner] 20:07:44
ACTUALLY CLOSES AT 9:00 P.M.


[Captioner] 20:07:47
OR SOMETIME AT 8:30 P.M.


[Captioner] 20:07:52
SO DECREASING TO 3:00 P.M.


[Captioner] 20:07:54
PROBABLY WOULD NOT WORK SINCE


[Captioner] 20:07:55
THERE'S STILL A LONG TIME


[Captioner] 20:07:55
THERE.


[Captioner] 20:08:01
ALSO, YOU CAN SEE FROM THE SNOW


[Captioner] 20:08:02
EVENT THAT HAPPENED RECENTLY HOW


[Captioner] 20:08:03
BAD THE TRAFFIC HERE CAN BE.


[Captioner] 20:08:05
SO I'M IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THE


[Captioner] 20:08:06
CONTINUATION OF THE PARKING


[Captioner] 20:08:07
PERMIT.


[Captioner] 20:08:07
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:08:10



[Captioner] 20:08:10
>> Ms. Gauthier: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:08:12
THE NEXT SPEAKER IS MARY.


[Captioner] 20:08:14
>> HI.


[Captioner] 20:08:18
I'M IN SUPPORT OF THE PARKING


[Captioner] 20:08:21
PERMIT PROGRAM AT MISSION PEAK.


[Captioner] 20:08:25
AND EXTENDING IT FOR THE NEXT 10


[Captioner] 20:08:25
YEARS.


[Captioner] 20:08:27
AND I'D LIKE TO ASK THE CITY


[Captioner] 20:08:31
COUNCIL TO EXTEND THE PROGRAM TO


[Captioner] 20:08:35
ANTELOPE, WEIBEL AND VINEYARD.


[Captioner] 20:08:38
THAT 150 SPACES THAT THE


[Captioner] 20:08:41
LIEUTENANT REFERRED TO.


[Captioner] 20:08:42
BECAUSE THERE'S JUST TOO MANY


[Captioner] 20:08:46
CARS DRIVING AROUND SLOWLY


[Captioner] 20:08:50
MAKING U TURNS, AND GOING DOWN


[Captioner] 20:08:52
THE STREET, AND THEN THERE'S


[Captioner] 20:08:54
TONS OF PEOPLE WALKING IN THE


[Captioner] 20:08:54
AREA.


[Captioner] 20:08:58
SO WHY NOT JUST LIKE CORDON OFF


[Captioner] 20:09:00
THAT WHOLE AREA TO BE


[Captioner] 20:09:01
NON-PARKING.


[Captioner] 20:09:04
OR PERMITTED PARKING ONLY FOR


[Captioner] 20:09:08
THE WEEKEND, TO DECREASE


[Captioner] 20:09:09
POSSIBLE TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS.


[Captioner] 20:09:13
PEOPLE RUNNING OVER THE


[Captioner] 20:09:13
PEDESTRIANS.


[Captioner] 20:09:13
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:09:16
>> Ms. Gauthier: THE NEXT


[Captioner] 20:09:18
SPEAKER IS LAVANYA.


[Captioner] 20:09:24
>> THANK YOU FOR THE


[Captioner] 20:09:24
OPPORTUNITY.


[Captioner] 20:09:25
I'M IN SUPPORT OF EXTENDING THIS
PROGRAM.


[Captioner] 20:09:31
I ALSO THINK THAT THE LITTER


[Captioner] 20:09:32
ENFORCEMENT NEEDS TO BE STEPPED


[Captioner] 20:09:32
UP.


[Captioner] 20:09:34
THERE'S A LOT OF GARBAGE ON THE


[Captioner] 20:09:36
STREETS AND ALSO ON THE TRAIL,


[Captioner] 20:09:38
AND I REALLY THINK THIS PROGRAM


[Captioner] 20:09:40
SHOULD BE EXTENDED.


[Captioner] 20:09:42
I SEE A LOT OF PEDESTRIANS


[Captioner] 20:09:44
WALKING DOWN IN VERY UNSAFE


[Captioner] 20:09:45
CONDITIONS BECAUSE LIKE THE


[Captioner] 20:09:47
PREVIOUS SPEAKER SAID, THERE'S


[Captioner] 20:09:48
ALWAYS SOMEONE HANGING AROUND ON


[Captioner] 20:09:50
THE SIDE WAITING FOR A PARKING


[Captioner] 20:09:52
SPOT, AND REALLY IT WOULD BE


[Captioner] 20:09:54
BETTER IF THIS WAS A NO-PARKING


[Captioner] 20:09:57
AREA ALL ALONG ANTELOPE, AS WELL


[Captioner] 20:09:57
AS VINEYARD.


[Captioner] 20:09:58
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:10:03
>> Ms. Gauthier: THE LAST


[Captioner] 20:10:06
SPEAKER IS COLIN.


[Captioner] 20:10:10
>> HELLO.


[Captioner] 20:10:11
CAN YOU HEAR ME?


[Captioner] 20:10:12
>> Ms. Gauthier: YES.


[Captioner] 20:10:13
>> OKAY.


[Captioner] 20:10:14
THIS IS COLIN.


[Captioner] 20:10:17
I ALSO LIVE ON HIDDEN VALLEY.


[Captioner] 20:10:19
I'D LIKE TO ELABORATE WHAT WAS


[Captioner] 20:10:20
JUST SAID ABOUT THE SNOW EVENT.


[Captioner] 20:10:21
WHAT HAPPENED WAS A COUPLE


[Captioner] 20:10:25
MONTHS AGO, IT SNOWED ON MISSION


[Captioner] 20:10:25
PEAK.


[Captioner] 20:10:28
THIS ATTRACTED A LOT OF VISITORS


[Captioner] 20:10:29
FROM ALL OVER THE BAY AREA.


[Captioner] 20:10:32
IT TURNS OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF


[Captioner] 20:10:34
THE DAY, THE TRAFFIC WAS SO BAD,


[Captioner] 20:10:34
THE CARS COULDN'T MOVE.


[Captioner] 20:10:38
THE POLICE HAD TO COME OUT TO


[Captioner] 20:10:40
TURN PEOPLE AWAY FROM THE


[Captioner] 20:10:42
STANFORD AVENUE, SO THEY COULD


[Captioner] 20:10:43
NOT GET INTO THE PARK.


[Captioner] 20:10:46
IT WAS SO BUSY, YOU WANTED TO GO


[Captioner] 20:10:49
IN AND GO OUT, TRAFFIC JAM,


[Captioner] 20:10:50
THANKS TO POLICE TO KEEP THE


[Captioner] 20:10:50
ORDER IN PLACE.


[Captioner] 20:10:52
SO JUST WANT TO ELABORATE THAT,


[Captioner] 20:10:53
THAT PEOPLE ARE AWARE WHAT


[Captioner] 20:10:54
HAPPENED HERE.


[Captioner] 20:10:56
BY THE WAY, I FULLY SUPPORT THIS


[Captioner] 20:10:56
PROPOSAL.


[Captioner] 20:10:56
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:11:10



[Captioner] 20:11:10
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:11:12
WAS THAT OUR LAST SPEAKER?


[Captioner] 20:11:13
>> Ms. Gauthier: YES, MA'AM.


[Captioner] 20:11:13
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:11:14
AT THIS TIME I'M GOING TO CLOSE


[Captioner] 20:11:15
THE PUBLIC HEARING.


[Captioner] 20:11:18
SO I'D LIKE TO BRING IT BACK TO


[Captioner] 20:11:18
THE COUNCIL FOR COMMENTS OR


[Captioner] 20:11:18
QUESTIONS.


[Captioner] 20:11:19
I SEE COUNCILMEMBER SHAO.


[Captioner] 20:11:24
>> Councilmember Shao: THANK


[Captioner] 20:11:25
YOU, MADAME MAYOR.


[Captioner] 20:11:30
I AM SUPPORTIVE TO THE


[Captioner] 20:11:31
EXTENSION OF THIS PROGRAM BUT I


[Captioner] 20:11:32
JUST WANT TO USE THIS


[Captioner] 20:11:33
OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE SURE THAT


[Captioner] 20:11:36
THERE'S NO UNINTENDED


[Captioner] 20:11:37
CONSEQUENCES, FOR EXAMPLE, IN


[Captioner] 20:11:38
THE ENFORCEMENT OF THE PARKING.


[Captioner] 20:11:43
I DO NOT RECALL THAT CITY


[Captioner] 20:11:44
COUNCILMEMBERS VOTED ON THE


[Captioner] 20:11:49
PARKING TICKET FINE NUMBER, MORE


[Captioner] 20:11:54
SPECIFICALLY LIKE ELEVATED FINE


[Captioner] 20:11:57
AMOUNT FOR THE MISSION PEAK


[Captioner] 20:11:59
STANFORD AVENUE AREA


[Captioner] 20:11:59
SPECIFICALLY.


[Captioner] 20:12:03
OTHERWISE I WOULD ASK WHY.


[Captioner] 20:12:05
YOU KNOW, IT'S KIND OF


[Captioner] 20:12:10
UNREASONABLE TO HAVE CITYWIDE


[Captioner] 20:12:12
UNIFORM FINE AMOUNT FOR


[Captioner] 20:12:13
VIOLATION OF PARKING.


[Captioner] 20:12:15
ALSO, I JUST WANT TO EMPHASIZE


[Captioner] 20:12:20
TO THE PUBLIC THAT THE CITY


[Captioner] 20:12:21
NEVER INTENDED TO USE THIS


[Captioner] 20:12:23
ENFORCEMENT AS A SOURCE OF


[Captioner] 20:12:23
INCOME.


[Captioner] 20:12:27
OTHERWISE, WHY NOT $200 A


[Captioner] 20:12:28
TICKET, RIGHT?


[Captioner] 20:12:34
SO THIS IS TO MAKE SURE THAT


[Captioner] 20:12:35
PEOPLE FOLLOW THE RULES AND ALSO


[Captioner] 20:12:38
TO PROTECT THE LOCAL RESIDENTS,


[Captioner] 20:12:38
THAT I UNDERSTAND.


[Captioner] 20:12:46
SO I JUST WANT TO COMMENT THAT


[Captioner] 20:12:48
WHILE WE'RE ENFORCING THE


[Captioner] 20:12:49
PARKING, WE NEED TO ALSO MAKE


[Captioner] 20:12:52
SURE THAT, A, ALL THE SIGNS ARE


[Captioner] 20:12:56
VERY CLEAR, AND 2, ALL THE FINE


[Captioner] 20:12:59
AMOUNT ALSO ARE POSTED THERE SO


[Captioner] 20:13:01
PEOPLE KNOW THE CONSEQUENCES


[Captioner] 20:13:02
WITHOUT ANY SURPRISE.


[Captioner] 20:13:08
AND THEN I DON'T THINK WE HAVE


[Captioner] 20:13:10
TO WAIT FOR ANOTHER 10 YEARS TO


[Captioner] 20:13:15
COME BACK AND THEN LOOK EITHER


[Captioner] 20:13:19
THE AREA OR THE FINE NUMBERS.


[Captioner] 20:13:22
I ASSUME THAT EVEN WHILE WE ARE


[Captioner] 20:13:24
RUNNING THIS PROGRAM, WE CAN


[Captioner] 20:13:26
STILL, FOR EXAMPLE, LOOK INTO


[Captioner] 20:13:30
THE POSSIBILITY OF EXTENDING OR


[Captioner] 20:13:33
SHRINKING THE AREA FOR THE


[Captioner] 20:13:37
ENFORCEMENT, AND ALSO REVIEW THE


[Captioner] 20:13:38
TICKET FINE AMOUNT.


[Captioner] 20:13:41
THAT IS WHAT I HOPE FOR.


[Captioner] 20:13:44
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:13:45
NEXT IS COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN.


[Captioner] 20:13:50
>> Councilmember Salwan: THANK


[Captioner] 20:13:51
YOU, MADAME MAYOR, AND THANK YOU


[Captioner] 20:13:53
TO OUR FINE POLICE DEPARTMENT


[Captioner] 20:13:54
FOR THE PRESENTATION.


[Captioner] 20:13:58
YOU KNOW, THIS IS A LONG TIME


[Captioner] 20:13:58
COMING.


[Captioner] 20:14:01
WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS FOR A


[Captioner] 20:14:01
LONG TIME NOW.


[Captioner] 20:14:05
AND YOU KNOW THIS IS A GOOD


[Captioner] 20:14:06
COMPROMISE BECAUSE BOTH SIDES


[Captioner] 20:14:10
SEEM TO HAVE ARRIVED AT SOME


[Captioner] 20:14:11
MIDDLE GROUND.


[Captioner] 20:14:13
PRIOR TO THIS, WE HAD A LOT OF


[Captioner] 20:14:16
ISSUES AS FAR AS JUST THE AMOUNT


[Captioner] 20:14:18
OF PARKING, THE AMOUNT OF


[Captioner] 20:14:19
VISITORS, AND I DIDN'T REALLY


[Captioner] 20:14:22
REALIZE IT UNTIL I WAS WORKING


[Captioner] 20:14:23
IN SANTA CLARA FOR A MONTH AND


[Captioner] 20:14:25
IT WAS AMAZING, THE NUMBER OF


[Captioner] 20:14:26
PEOPLE IN SANTA CLARA THAT WERE


[Captioner] 20:14:27
COMING TO MISSION PEAK.


[Captioner] 20:14:29
AND SO EVERY SECOND OR THIRD


[Captioner] 20:14:31
PERSON WAS LIKE, YEAH, I GO


[Captioner] 20:14:33
HIKING AT MISSION PEAK, SO IT


[Captioner] 20:14:35
CAME TO REALITY THAT THERE'S A


[Captioner] 20:14:36
LOT OF FOLKS THAT ARE COMING TO


[Captioner] 20:14:37
FREMONT JUST FOR MISSION PEAK.


[Captioner] 20:14:39
AND SO WE DEFINITELY WANT TO


[Captioner] 20:14:41
HAVE ACCESS, BUT WE ALSO NEED TO


[Captioner] 20:14:43
BALANCE THE COMMUNITY'S


[Captioner] 20:14:43
INTEREST.


[Captioner] 20:14:46
NOBODY WANTS THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE


[Captioner] 20:14:47
DESCENDING ON THEIR


[Captioner] 20:14:48
NEIGHBORHOOD, REGARDLESS OF


[Captioner] 20:14:48
WHERE YOU LIVE.


[Captioner] 20:14:52
AND SO I THINK THIS IS A GOOD


[Captioner] 20:14:53
BALANCE, IT'S WORKING WELL, IT


[Captioner] 20:14:54
DOESN'T COST THE CITY ANY MONEY,


[Captioner] 20:14:56
AND SO I THINK WE SHOULD


[Captioner] 20:14:58
CONTINUE THAT, AND SO I'M HAPPY


[Captioner] 20:15:00
TO SUPPORT THIS FORWARD.


[Captioner] 20:15:03
IT'S LIKE DEJA VU, I HAD A


[Captioner] 20:15:06
MEETING ON THIS JUST ABOUT A


[Captioner] 20:15:07
WEEK OR TWO AGO.


[Captioner] 20:15:08
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:15:08
>> Mayor Mei: COUNCILMEMBER


[Captioner] 20:15:09
KENG.


[Captioner] 20:15:10
>> Councilmember Keng: THANK


[Captioner] 20:15:10
YOU, MADAME MAYOR.


[Captioner] 20:15:13
SO I AGREE THAT THE PROGRAM HAS


[Captioner] 20:15:16
BEEN WORKING WELL AND IT


[Captioner] 20:15:17
PROTECTS THE NEIGHBORHOOD SO


[Captioner] 20:15:22
THAT THE


[Captioner] 20:15:23
NEIGHBORS THAT LIVE ON THOSE


[Captioner] 20:15:25
STREETS CAN HAVE PARKING FOR


[Captioner] 20:15:27
THEIR IMMEDIATE FAMILY OR


[Captioner] 20:15:30
VISITORS, AND I JUST -- I'M


[Captioner] 20:15:33
WONDERING WHAT ARE OUR THOUGHT


[Captioner] 20:15:36
ON EXTENDING IT ON VINEYARD AND


[Captioner] 20:15:39
ANTELOPE DRIVE, BECAUSE AS WE


[Captioner] 20:15:40
PREVIOUSLY HEARD, SOME NEIGHBORS


[Captioner] 20:15:42
ALSO LIVE ON THOSE STREETS AND


[Captioner] 20:15:47
IT'S CAUSING SOME TRAFFIC JAM


[Captioner] 20:15:49
FOR ALLOWING VISITORS TO PARK ON


[Captioner] 20:15:50
THOSE STREETS OR IF WE SHOULD


[Captioner] 20:15:51
EXTEND THE PROGRAM ON THOSE


[Captioner] 20:15:52
STREETS AT ALL.


[Captioner] 20:16:00
>> Mayor Mei: I DON'T KNOW IF


[Captioner] 20:16:01
STAFF OR ANYBODY WANTS TO


[Captioner] 20:16:02
RESPOND ON THIS.


[Captioner] 20:16:05
I DON'T THINK WE HAD THIS


[Captioner] 20:16:07
CONVERSATION SO I APOLOGIZE AT


[Captioner] 20:16:08
THIS TIME IT'S NOT SOMETHING --


[Captioner] 20:16:09
I'D HAVE TO HEAR FROM THE REST


[Captioner] 20:16:11
OF THE COUNCIL IF THAT'S THE


[Captioner] 20:16:11
INTEREST AT THIS TIME.


[Captioner] 20:16:13
I WANTED TO NOTE REAL QUICKLY


[Captioner] 20:16:14
THAT WHENEVER WE MAKE A CHANGE


[Captioner] 20:16:15
OR EXPANSION, IT WOULD BE A


[Captioner] 20:16:16
CHANGE IN COST AND WE'D HAVE TO


[Captioner] 20:16:18
CALCULATE THAT, AND EVEN


[Captioner] 20:16:20
SOMETHING SO SIMPLE, I KNOW


[Captioner] 20:16:21
THERE WERE COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS


[Captioner] 20:16:22
ABOUT CHANGING THE HOURS SO THAT


[Captioner] 20:16:24
WOULD MEAN REPOSTING AND


[Captioner] 20:16:25
CHANGING ALL THE SIGNS AND THAT


[Captioner] 20:16:27
ALSO IS AN ADDITIONAL


[Captioner] 20:16:27
INCREMENTAL COST.


[Captioner] 20:16:27
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:16:29
ARE THERE ANY OTHER CLARIFYING


[Captioner] 20:16:30
QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS AT THIS


[Captioner] 20:16:30
TIME?


[Captioner] 20:16:32
OKAY.


[Captioner] 20:16:34
COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL?


[Captioner] 20:16:36
>> Councilmember Campbell: ONE


[Captioner] 20:16:36
QUICK ONE.


[Captioner] 20:16:38
I WAS GOING TO ASK THE SAME


[Captioner] 20:16:40
QUESTION ABOUT THE EXTENSION AND


[Captioner] 20:16:46
THE TIME, BUT I ALSO WANTED TO


[Captioner] 20:16:47
UNDERSTAND THE WEEKDAYS.


[Captioner] 20:16:50
FOLKS GO UP THERE ON THE


[Captioner] 20:16:50
WEEKDAYS TOO, RIGHT?


[Captioner] 20:16:52
SO WHY ISN'T THERE PERMIT


[Captioner] 20:16:53
PARKING DURING THE WEEKDAYS?


[Captioner] 20:16:54
I SHOULD HAVE ASKED THIS


[Captioner] 20:16:55
QUESTION EARLIER BUT IT JUST


[Captioner] 20:16:56
CAME TO ME JUST NOW.


[Captioner] 20:17:01
>> WE RARELY SEE AN INCREASE IN


[Captioner] 20:17:06
THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE COMING TO


[Captioner] 20:17:07
THE MISSION PEAK AREA.


[Captioner] 20:17:09
IT'S USUALLY ON THE WEEKENDS


[Captioner] 20:17:10
THAT CREATES A LOT OF THE


[Captioner] 20:17:12
PARKING ISSUES FOR THE COMMUNITY


[Captioner] 20:17:15
MEMBERS AND WE HAVEN'T HEARD ANY


[Captioner] 20:17:17
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS ABOUT THAT


[Captioner] 20:17:20
OR RECEIVED ANY TYPE OF


[Captioner] 20:17:20
CORRESPONDENCE FROM THE


[Captioner] 20:17:22
COMMUNITY MEMBERS  ISSUES DURING


[Captioner] 20:17:23
THE WEEKDAYS INTEREST.


[Captioner] 20:17:28
>> Councilmember Campbell: I


[Captioner] 20:17:29
HEARD MAYOR MEI SAY THERE'S A


[Captioner] 20:17:31
COST INVOLVED IF WE SHORTEN THE


[Captioner] 20:17:33
TIME BECAUSE ONE OF THE SPEAKERS


[Captioner] 20:17:36
INDICATED THAT THEY HAVE TO DO


[Captioner] 20:17:41
SWAPPING OUT OF THE PERMITS AND


[Captioner] 20:17:42
IT'S SORT OF AN INCONVENIENCE


[Captioner] 20:17:44
FOR THEM TO HAVE TO BE ABLE TO


[Captioner] 20:17:44
DO THAT.


[Captioner] 20:17:48
WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT


[Captioner] 20:17:50
EVEN THE POSSIBILITY OF LOWERING


[Captioner] 20:17:50
THE TIME?


[Captioner] 20:17:51
REGARDLESS OF THE COST.


[Captioner] 20:17:53
IF YOU HAD ALL THE MONEY IN THE


[Captioner] 20:17:54
WORLD AND ALL THE TIME IN THE


[Captioner] 20:17:55
WORLD, WOULD YOU THINK THIS


[Captioner] 20:17:58
WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA?


[Captioner] 20:17:59
>> I THINK WE SHOULD MAINTAIN


[Captioner] 20:18:03
THE WAY THE TIME IS SET UP NOW


[Captioner] 20:18:05
IN THE SENSE THAT IF WE DID


[Captioner] 20:18:07
LOWER IT, THERE ARE STILL PEOPLE


[Captioner] 20:18:09
THAT LIKE TO HIKE IN THE


[Captioner] 20:18:09
EVENING.


[Captioner] 20:18:11
COOLER TEMPERATURES, YOU KNOW,


[Captioner] 20:18:15
KNOWING THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE


[Captioner] 20:18:16
ACCESS, AVAILABILITY TO THE


[Captioner] 20:18:18
NEIGHBORHOODS, TO PARK IN THOSE


[Captioner] 20:18:20
NEIGHBORHOODS, IT WOULD JUST


[Captioner] 20:18:23
INCREASE IT EVEN FURTHER, AND


[Captioner] 20:18:25
THE AMOUNT OF WHAT THE PUBLIC


[Captioner] 20:18:28
COMMENTS WERE ABOUT TRASH,


[Captioner] 20:18:32
TRAFFIC HAZARDS, SIMPLE --


[Captioner] 20:18:34
TRYING TO BACK OUT OF YOUR


[Captioner] 20:18:35
DRIVEWAY, SO KEEPING IT THE WAY


[Captioner] 20:18:37
IT IS NOW WILL MAINTAIN SAFETY


[Captioner] 20:18:40
FOR ALL THE COMMUNITY MEMBERS


[Captioner] 20:18:41
COMING TO THE AREA, AS WELL AS


[Captioner] 20:18:42
THE RESIDENTS.


[Captioner] 20:18:43
>> Councilmember Campbell:


[Captioner] 20:18:43
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:18:46
AND THAT SAME QUESTION, BUT THIS


[Captioner] 20:18:48
TIME EXTENDING IT, IF YOU HAD


[Captioner] 20:18:49
ALL THE MONEY IN THE WORLD, AND


[Captioner] 20:18:51
ALL THE TIME IN THE WORLD, WOULD


[Captioner] 20:18:52
YOU THINK IT WOULD BE A GOOD


[Captioner] 20:18:55
IDEA TO EXTEND IT OR IS THAT


[Captioner] 20:18:56
SOMETHING THAT THE POLICE


[Captioner] 20:18:58
DEPARTMENT DOESN'T SEE AS AN


[Captioner] 20:18:59
ISSUE AT THIS TIME?


[Captioner] 20:19:02
>> I'M SORRY, COUNCILMEMBER


[Captioner] 20:19:04
CAMPBELL, EXTENDED --


[Captioner] 20:19:04
>> Councilmember Campbell: TO


[Captioner] 20:19:06
ANTELOPE AND VINEYARD?


[Captioner] 20:19:08
AND I HEARD SOMETHING ABOUT


[Captioner] 20:19:10
WEIBEL, VINEYARD AND ANTELOPE


[Captioner] 20:19:10
DRIVE.


[Captioner] 20:19:12
>> SO THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING


[Captioner] 20:19:14
THAT WE'D HAVE TO RESEARCH A


[Captioner] 20:19:17
LITTLE FURTHER AND DETERMINE THE


[Captioner] 20:19:22
IMPACT IT DOES HAVE IN THAT


[Captioner] 20:19:23
COMMUNITY SPECIFICALLY BEFORE WE


[Captioner] 20:19:26
CAN MAKE A DECISION, AGAIN, LIKE


[Captioner] 20:19:26
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN MENTIONED,


[Captioner] 20:19:30
THIS WAS A COMPROMISE TO ALLOW


[Captioner] 20:19:31
SOME BALANCE WITHIN THE


[Captioner] 20:19:32
COMMUNITY AND OUTSIDE COMMUNITY


[Captioner] 20:19:34
MEMBERS TO COME AND ENJOY THE


[Captioner] 20:19:34
PARK.


[Captioner] 20:19:36
>> Councilmember Campbell:


[Captioner] 20:19:36
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.


[Captioner] 20:19:41
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:19:45
I JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT I


[Captioner] 20:19:45
SUPPORT THIS EFFORT TO EXTEND


[Captioner] 20:19:46
IT.


[Captioner] 20:19:47
WE'VE HAD MANY CONVERSATIONS


[Captioner] 20:19:50
OVER THE YEARS, AND I DO ALSO


[Captioner] 20:19:51
NOTE THE COMMENT AND SUGGESTION


[Captioner] 20:19:53
TO TRY TO DIRECT PEOPLE, AND


[Captioner] 20:19:55
I'VE ALWAYS TRIED TO ENCOURAGE


[Captioner] 20:19:56
PEOPLE TO PARK AT THE OHLONE


[Captioner] 20:19:58
SITE IF POSSIBLE AS AN OPTION


[Captioner] 20:19:59
TOO, BECAUSE IT'S GOT COVERED


[Captioner] 20:20:01
PARKING WHICH IN THE SUMMER IS


[Captioner] 20:20:02
NICER TO KEEP YOUR CAR COOL.


[Captioner] 20:20:06
AND ALSO THE FUNDS HELP SUPPORT


[Captioner] 20:20:08
OUR OHLONE COLLEGE STUDENTS, SO


[Captioner] 20:20:10
THAT'S -- I MEAN, IT GOES TO THE


[Captioner] 20:20:13
SCHOOLS, AND SO THAT'S A


[Captioner] 20:20:15
CONVENIENCE BUT IT'S ALSO A


[Captioner] 20:20:15
BENEFIT.


[Captioner] 20:20:16
I THINK THAT THIS IS SOMETHING


[Captioner] 20:20:21
WE'VE EXPLORED OVER THE YEARS XZ


[Captioner] 20:20:22
AND WE'VE SEEN THE IMPACT.


[Captioner] 20:20:23
I APPRECIATE THE ACKNOWLEDGMENT


[Captioner] 20:20:28
FROM THE PUBLIC DURING THE


[Captioner] 20:20:30
UNUSUAL SNOW PERIODS, SNOW DAYS


[Captioner] 20:20:31
FOR US IN OUR CITY, BUT I THINK


[Captioner] 20:20:34
THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I


[Captioner] 20:20:34
FULLY SUPPORT.


[Captioner] 20:20:36
ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR


[Captioner] 20:20:37
COMMENTS AT THIS TIME?


[Captioner] 20:20:40
I'D LIKE TO CALL A MOTION --


[Captioner] 20:20:41

I ALSO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE OTHER


[Captioner] 20:35:05
PANELISTS THAT ARE HERE THIS


[Captioner] 20:35:06
EVENING TO RESPOND DIRECTLY TO


[Captioner] 20:35:07

THI INCLUDE SEAN WASHINGTON, OUR


[Captioner] 20:35:16
POLICE CHIEF, AND LAURIE FLORES,

OUR FREMONT HOMELESS SERVICES


[Captioner] 20:35:18
MANAGER.


[Captioner] 20:35:19
WE ALSO HAVE WITH US THIS


[Captioner] 20:35:26
EVENING VIA ZOOM ANDY MEYER,


[Captioner] 20:35:31
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CODY


[Captioner] 20:35:31
HOLMES.


[Captioner] 20:35:35
WE HAVE ALSO WITH US AARON


[Captioner] 20:35:36
CRISWAL REPRESENTING STEP-UP,


[Captioner] 20:35:39
THE ORGANIZATION THAT WILL BE


[Captioner] 20:35:41
OPERATING THE SITE AND PROVIDING


[Captioner] 20:35:43
SUPPORTIVE SERVICES TO 


[Captioner] 20:35:43
RESIDENTS.


[Captioner] 20:35:45
SO WE HAVE A LOT OF FOLKS WHO


[Captioner] 20:35:46
WILL BE AVAILABLE TO ANSWER


[Captioner] 20:35:48
QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE.


[Captioner] 20:35:53
SO HOMELESSNESS AS YOU KNOW IS A


[Captioner] 20:35:56
HUGE PROBLEM FOR CALIFORNIA WITH


[Captioner] 20:35:58
28 PERCENT OF THE NATION'S


[Captioner] 20:36:01
HOMELESS POPULATION.


[Captioner] 20:36:03
IT ALSO HAS HAD THE HIGHEST RATE


[Captioner] 20:36:07
OF UNSHELTERED PEOPLE, AT 70.4%


[Captioner] 20:36:12
OR OVER 161,000 FOLKS


[Captioner] 20:36:13
UNSHELTERED.


[Captioner] 20:36:15
AND IN 2020, THE STATE HAD THE


[Captioner] 20:36:16
GREATEST INCREASE IN


[Captioner] 20:36:20
HOMELESSNESS AT 6.8%.


[Captioner] 20:36:23
HOMELESSNESS IS ALSO A GROWING


[Captioner] 20:36:24
PROBLEM FOR FREMONT AND IT HAS


[Captioner] 20:36:26
BEEN A TOP PRIORITY FOR THE CITY


[Captioner] 20:36:28
COUNCIL FOR SEVERAL YEARS NOW.


[Captioner] 20:36:32
ONE OF THE MAJOR FACTORS


[Captioner] 20:36:33
ACCOUNTING FOR HOMELESSNESS IS


[Captioner] 20:36:35
THE SHORTAGE OF AFFORDABLE


[Captioner] 20:36:35
HOUSING.


[Captioner] 20:36:38
HOMEKEY PRESENTS A TRULY


[Captioner] 20:36:39
UNPRECEDENTED OPPORTUNITY TO


[Captioner] 20:36:41
SECURE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF


[Captioner] 20:36:43
STATE FUNDING NOT ONLY TO


[Captioner] 20:36:47
PROVIDE PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE


[Captioner] 20:36:48
HOUSING FOR CHRONICALLY HOMELESS


[Captioner] 20:36:50
PERSONS, BUT TO DO IT WITHIN A


[Captioner] 20:36:50
YEAR'S TIME.


[Captioner] 20:36:53
THE PROJECT WE PROPOSE THIS


[Captioner] 20:36:55
EVENING ALSO ALLIANCE WITH THE


[Captioner] 20:36:57
ALAMEDA COUNTY'S IMPLEMENTATION


[Captioner] 20:37:00
PLAN TO END HOMELESSNESS BY


[Captioner] 20:37:04
2026, CALLED HOME TOGETHER,


[Captioner] 20:37:05
WHICH SERVES AS A BLUEPRINT FOR


[Captioner] 20:37:06
FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES FROM BOTH


[Captioner] 20:37:09
THE STATE AND THE COUNTY.


[Captioner] 20:37:11
STAFF IS REQUESTING AUTHORITY TO


[Captioner] 20:37:14
APPLY FOR APPROXIMATELY


[Captioner] 20:37:17
35 MILLION IN HOMEKEY FUNDS TO


[Captioner] 20:37:18
CONVERT MOTEL 6 ON RESEARCH


[Captioner] 20:37:20
AVENUE TO PERMANENT AFFORDABLE


[Captioner] 20:37:21
SUPPORTIVE HOUSING.


[Captioner] 20:37:26
I WOULD LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THAT


[Captioner] 20:37:28
THIS PROJECT IS NOT A HOMELESS


[Captioner] 20:37:29
SHELTER.


[Captioner] 20:37:31
IT IS AN AFFORDABLE HOUSING


[Captioner] 20:37:31
DEVELOPMENT.


[Captioner] 20:37:34
FREMONT HAS DEVELOPED MANY


[Captioner] 20:37:37
SUCCESSFUL AFFORDABLE HOUSING


[Captioner] 20:37:37
DEVELOPMENTS.


[Captioner] 20:37:40
THIS ONE SERVES A SPECIFIC


[Captioner] 20:37:42
SEGMENT OF THE LOW INCOME


[Captioner] 20:37:44
POPULATION IN OUR COMMUNITY.


[Captioner] 20:37:47
TENANTS WILL PAY RENT AND BE


[Captioner] 20:37:48
EXPECTED TO MEET THE


[Captioner] 20:37:50
REQUIREMENTS OF THEIR RENTAL

HOMELESSNESS THAT SUZANNE JUST


[Captioner] 20:41:13
DESCRIBED, I ALSO WANTED TO


[Captioner] 20:41:16
PROVIDE SOME CONTEXT AS TO HOW


[Captioner] 20:41:17
THE PROPOSED HOMEKEY PROJECT


[Captioner] 20:41:18
RELATES TO STATE AND REGIONAL


[Captioner] 20:41:21

[Captioner] 20:41:23
EVERY CITY AND COUNTY IN


[Captioner] 20:41:24

[Captioner] 20:41:25
ADOPT AS PART OF ITS GENERAL


[Captioner] 20:41:28
PLAN A CHAPTER KNOWN AS A


[Captioner] 20:41:30
HOUSING ELEMENT, WHICH SHOWS HOW


[Captioner] 20:41:31
A COMMUNITY WILL MEET PROJECTED


[Captioner] 20:41:31
HOUSING NEEDS.


[Captioner] 20:41:35
COUNCIL RECENTLY ADOPTED AND A

WITH STATE LAW THE CITY'S


[Captioner] 20:41:39

[Captioner] 20:41:40
2023 TO 2031.


[Captioner] 20:41:42
PART OF THE HOUSING ELEMENT


[Captioner] 20:41:44
PROCESS IS THE ASSIGNMENT OF A


[Captioner] 20:41:45
TARGET NUMBER OF NEW HOUSING


[Captioner] 20:41:46
UNITS TO BE CREATED FOR


[Captioner] 20:41:47
DIFFERENT INCOME LEVELS.


[Captioner] 20:41:51
FREMONT'S ASSIGNED TOTAL FOR


[Captioner] 20:41:52
EXTREMELY LOW INCOME AND VERY


[Captioner] 20:41:57
LOW INCOME UNITS IS 3,640 UNITS


[Captioner] 20:41:58
FOR THE NEXT EIGHT YEARS.


[Captioner] 20:42:00
THIS NUMBER IS GOING TO BE VERY


[Captioner] 20:42:02
DIFFICULT TO ACHIEVE DUE TO HIGH


[Captioner] 20:42:04
CONSTRUCTION COSTS, THE COST OF


[Captioner] 20:42:06
NEEDED SERVICES, AND THE LONG


[Captioner] 20:42:08
LEAD TIME REQUIRED FOR NEW


[Captioner] 20:42:08
CONSTRUCTION.


[Captioner] 20:42:11
BY FOCUSING ON PROJECTS THAT


[Captioner] 20:42:14
DON'T REQUIRE ALL NEW


[Captioner] 20:42:16

[Captioner] 20:42:18
OPERATING SUBSIDIES AND BY


[Captioner] 20:42:19
STREAMLINING THE APPROVAL


[Captioner] 20:42:20
PROCESS, THE HOMEKEY PROGRAM


[Captioner] 20:42:21
ADDRESSES MANY OF THE BARRIERS


[Captioner] 20:42:24
AND IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO


[Captioner] 20:42:25
MAKE PROGRESS TOWARDS MEETING


[Captioner] 20:42:26
OUR ASSIGNED TARGET.


[Captioner] 20:42:33
THE STAY INITIATED THE HOMEKEY


[Captioner] 20:42:36
PROGRAM IN 2020 AS A WAY TO GET


[Captioner] 20:42:37
HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS AND


[Captioner] 20:42:38
FAMILIES HOUSED AS QUICKLY AND


[Captioner] 20:42:39
COST EFFECTIVELY AS POSSIBLE


[Captioner] 20:42:41
DURING THE COVID CRISIS.


[Captioner] 20:42:43
FREMONT DID NOT APPLY FOR


[Captioner] 20:42:45
FUNDING IN THE FIRST HOMEKEY


[Captioner] 20:42:47
ROUND, AS STAFF WAS FOCUSED ON


[Captioner] 20:42:48
CONSTRUCTING AND OPENING THE


[Captioner] 20:42:49
HOUSING NAVIGATION CENTER.


[Captioner] 20:42:51
HOWEVER, IN ANTICIPATION OF THE


[Captioner] 20:42:53
SECOND ROUND, STAFF ISSUED A


[Captioner] 20:42:55
REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS IN 2021.


[Captioner] 20:42:58
WE RECEIVED ONE PROPOSAL


[Captioner] 20:43:00
IDENTIFYING FOUR POSSIBLE HOTEL


[Captioner] 20:43:09
PROPERTIES FOR CONVERSION FROM


[Captioner] 20:43:11
SHANGRI-LA INDUSTRIES AND THEIR


[Captioner] 20:43:11
PARTNER STEP UP.


[Captioner] 20:43:13
AFTER REVIEWING DIFFERENT


[Captioner] 20:43:19
PROPERTIES INCLUDED IN


[Captioner] 20:43:20
SHANGRI-LA, COUNCIL APPROVED AN


[Captioner] 20:43:21
APPLICATION TO THE STATE FOR


[Captioner] 20:43:23
HOMEKEY FUNDING TO CONVERT THE


[Captioner] 20:43:25
MOTEL 6 ON RESEARCH AVENUE TO


[Captioner] 20:43:27
PERMANENT AFFORDABLE SUPPORTIVE


[Captioner] 20:43:27
HOUSING.


[Captioner] 20:43:30
THE REASONS FOR RECOMMENDING THE


[Captioner] 20:43:31
MOTEL 6 SITE INCLUDED THAT IT


[Captioner] 20:43:34
HAD THE LOWEST COST PER UNIT FOR


[Captioner] 20:43:36
ACQUISITION AND CONSTRUCTION,


[Captioner] 20:43:38
THE LOWEST COST PER UNIT FOR


[Captioner] 20:43:39
OPERATIONS AND SERVICES, THE


[Captioner] 20:43:44
LARGEST NUMBER OF UNITS, THEREBY


[Captioner] 20:43:44
HOUSING MORE OF THOSE IN NEED.


[Captioner] 20:43:47
IT RANKED HIGHEST ON LOCATIONAL


[Captioner] 20:43:49
CRITERIA REGARDING ACCESS TO


[Captioner] 20:43:50
NEARBY DAILY NEEDS AND SERVICES,


[Captioner] 20:43:53
AND IT DID NOT RAISE MAJOR


[Captioner] 20:43:56
CONCERNS REGARDING CONFLICTS


[Captioner] 20:43:56
WITH INDUSTRIAL USES.


[Captioner] 20:43:58
UNFORTUNATELY THE CITY'S ROUND


[Captioner] 20:44:00
TWO HOMEKEY APPLICATION WAS NOT


[Captioner] 20:44:02
SELECTED BY THE STATE FOR


[Captioner] 20:44:05
FUNDING DUE TO CONCERNS THAT THE


[Captioner] 20:44:06
FINANCIAL DOCUMENTS SUBMITTED


[Captioner] 20:44:08
DID NOT COMPLY WITH GRANT


[Captioner] 20:44:08
REQUIREMENTS.


[Captioner] 20:44:13
CITY STAFF AND SHANGRI-LA STAFF


[Captioner] 20:44:15
BELIEVE IT WILL BE RELATIVELY


[Captioner] 20:44:16
STRAIGHTFORWARD TO ADDRESS THESE


[Captioner] 20:44:17
COMMENTS IN THE ROUND THREE


[Captioner] 20:44:17
APPLICATION.


[Captioner] 20:44:24
IN MARCH 2023, THE STATE


[Captioner] 20:44:25
ANNOUNCED HOMEKEY ROUND THREE.


[Captioner] 20:44:28
THERE IS A TOTAL OF $736 MILLION


[Captioner] 20:44:31
BEING MADE AVAILABLE STATEWIDE


[Captioner] 20:44:33
WITH 111 MILLION OF THAT TOTAL


[Captioner] 20:44:35
DEDICATED TO PROJECTS IN THE


[Captioner] 20:44:35
NINE-COUNTY BAY AREA.


[Captioner] 20:44:38
THE STATE BEGAN ACCEPTING


[Captioner] 20:44:41
APPLICATIONS ON APRIL 24TH, AND


[Captioner] 20:44:43
AND WILL CONTINUE TO ACCEPT


[Captioner] 20:44:46
APPLICATIONS UNTIL JULY 2023, OR


[Captioner] 20:44:47
UNTIL FUNDS ARE EXHAUSTED.


[Captioner] 20:44:51
THE MAXIMUM AWARD PER PROJECT IS


[Captioner] 20:44:51
$35 MILLION.


[Captioner] 20:44:58
STAFF IS PROPOSING TO SUBMIT A


[Captioner] 20:45:00
ROUND 3 APPLICATION TO CONVERT


[Captioner] 20:45:03
THE 159-ROOM MOTEL 6 TO 156


[Captioner] 20:45:05
UNITS OF PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE


[Captioner] 20:45:08
HOUSING, PLUS 3 UNITS FOR


[Captioner] 20:45:09
ON-SITE MANAGERS.


[Captioner] 20:45:10
THE PROPERTY WOULD BE OWNED AND


[Captioner] 20:45:13
OPERATED BY A NEW ENTITY CREATED


[Captioner] 20:45:15
BY SHANGRI-LA AND STEP UP


[Captioner] 20:45:15
SPECIFICALLY FOR THIS PROJECT.


[Captioner] 20:45:17
THE EXISTING MOTEL ROOMS WOULD


[Captioner] 20:45:19
BE CONVERTED TO STUDIO


[Captioner] 20:45:23
APARTMENTS WITH KITCHENETTES AND


[Captioner] 20:45:26
THE PROPERTY WOULD BE UPDATED TO


[Captioner] 20:45:28
MEET AMERICANS WITH DISABILITY


[Captioner] 20:45:29
ACT STANDARDS.


[Captioner] 20:45:32
A NEWPORTABLE STRUCTURE WOULD BE


[Captioner] 20:45:33
ADDED IN THE PARKING LOT FOR


[Captioner] 20:45:34
RESIDENT SERVICES AND


[Captioner] 20:45:34
ACTIVITIES.


[Captioner] 20:45:37
OVERALL, THERE WOULD BE ONE


[Captioner] 20:45:39
STAFF MEMBER FOR EVERY 20


[Captioner] 20:45:39
TENANTS.


[Captioner] 20:45:44
THE TOTAL COST PER UNIT WOULD BE


[Captioner] 20:45:46
$266,000 APPROXIMATELY, COMPARED


[Captioner] 20:45:51
TO COSTS THAT COULD BE $700,000


[Captioner] 20:45:52
OR MORE PER UNIT IN NEW


[Captioner] 20:45:52
CONSTRUCTION.


[Captioner] 20:45:57
SIMILAR TO MOST OTHER AFFORDABLE


[Captioner] 20:45:59
HOUSING PROJECTS IN FREMONT, A


[Captioner] 20:46:00
FINANCIAL SUBSIDY FROM THE CITY


[Captioner] 20:46:01
IS NEEDED TO MAKE THE PROJECT


[Captioner] 20:46:01
WORK FINANCIALLY.


[Captioner] 20:46:05
IN THIS CASE, TO LEVERAGE


[Captioner] 20:46:06
HOMEKEY FUNDING AND FINANCING


[Captioner] 20:46:08
PROVIDED BY SHANGRI-LA, THE CITY


[Captioner] 20:46:13
NEEDS TO COMMIT $8,668,000.


[Captioner] 20:46:15
I WOULD NOTE THAT $1 MILLION OF


[Captioner] 20:46:17
THAT TOTAL IS MONEY THAT ALAMEDA


[Captioner] 20:46:18
COUNTY WILL PROVIDE TO THE CITY


[Captioner] 20:46:20
IF WE'RE SUCCESSFUL IN OBTAINING


[Captioner] 20:46:22
A HOMEKEY GRANT SO THE NET CITY


[Captioner] 20:46:27
FUNDING COMMITMENT WOULD BE


[Captioner] 20:46:27
7,668,000.


[Captioner] 20:46:30
THIS EQUATES TO A SUBSIDY OF


[Captioner] 20:46:33
LESS THAN $50,000 PER UNIT, FAR


[Captioner] 20:46:34
BELOW THE AVERAGE CITY


[Captioner] 20:46:36
COMMITMENT ON RECENT AFFORDABLE


[Captioner] 20:46:36
HOUSING PROJECTS.


[Captioner] 20:46:40
NOW I'LL HAND IT BACK TO


[Captioner] 20:46:42
SUZANNE, WHO WILL PROVIDE


[Captioner] 20:46:43
INFORMATION REGARDING THE


[Captioner] 20:46:44

[Captioner] 20:46:50
PARTNERED SUCCESSFULLY ON SEVEN


[Captioner] 20:46:50

[Captioner] 20:47:10
SUPPORTIVE HOUSING COMMUNITY FOR


[Captioner] 20:47:11

AND SAFETY CONCERNS.


[Captioner] 20:49:42
STEP UP ON SECOND STREET WAS


[Captioner] 20:49:44
ESTABLISHED 35 YEARS AGO AS A


[Captioner] 20:49:47
DROP-IN CENTER OFFERING A SAFE


[Captioner] 20:49:49
SPACE FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO NEEDED


[Captioner] 20:49:50
A COMPASSIONATE ENVIRONMENT WITH


[Captioner] 20:49:52
RECOVERY ORIENTED ACTIVITIES


[Captioner] 20:49:56
SUCH AS ART THERAPY, EMPLOYMENT


[Captioner] 20:49:57
TRAINING AND COPE SKILLS AND


[Captioner] 20:49:58
SERVICE COORDINATION.


[Captioner] 20:50:00
THEIR STAFF OBSERVED MANY OF


[Captioner] 20:50:01
THEIR MEMBERS WERE UNHOUSED,


[Captioner] 20:50:05
WHICH COMPLICATED AND 


[Captioner] 20:50:06
EXACERBATED THEIR EXISTING


[Captioner] 20:50:06
NEEDS.


[Captioner] 20:50:10
SO IN 1994, STEP UP ALONG WITH


[Captioner] 20:50:12
THE DEVELOPMENT PARTNER BUILT


[Captioner] 20:50:13
ITS FIRST UNITS OF PERMANENT


[Captioner] 20:50:15
SUPPORTIVE HOUSING.


[Captioner] 20:50:17
TODAY STEP UP PROVIDES


[Captioner] 20:50:19
SUPPORTIVE SERVICES FOR 21


[Captioner] 20:50:19
PROPERTIES.


[Captioner] 20:50:22
THE GOAL OF THE SHANGRI-LA STEP


[Captioner] 20:50:25
UP PARTNERSHIP IS TO BE AT THE


[Captioner] 20:50:27
FOREFRONT OF DELIVERING SAFE


[Captioner] 20:50:29
HOUSING SOLUTIONS COUPLED WITH


[Captioner] 20:50:30
COMPASSIONATE SUPPORT TO HELP


[Captioner] 20:50:33
THE MOST AT RISK RECOVER,


[Captioner] 20:50:35
STABILIZE AND INTEGRATE INTO


[Captioner] 20:50:35
THEIR COMMUNITIES.


[Captioner] 20:50:40
IN A RECENT VISIT TO THEIR SAN


[Captioner] 20:50:43
BERNARDINO SITE, GOVERNOR NEWSOM


[Captioner] 20:50:44
SAID, SHANGRI-LA AND STEP UP


[Captioner] 20:50:48
GAVE SOME OF THE MOST VULNERABLE


[Captioner] 20:50:50
CALIFORNIANS DIGNITY OF A KEY, A


[Captioner] 20:50:51
LOCK, A DOOR, AND A PLACE TO


[Captioner] 20:50:52
CALL HOME.


[Captioner] 20:50:57
STEP UP UTILIZES EVIDENCE-BASED


[Captioner] 20:51:00
PRACTICES OF HOUSING FIRST, HARM


[Captioner] 20:51:02
REDUCTION, AND TRAUMA-INFORMED


[Captioner] 20:51:02
CARE.


[Captioner] 20:51:04
HOUSING FIRST DOES NOT MEAN


[Captioner] 20:51:06
HOUSING ONLY.


[Captioner] 20:51:09
THOUGH IT IS A CRITICAL KEY TO


[Captioner] 20:51:11
HELPING PEOPLE TURN THEIR LIVES


[Captioner] 20:51:11
AROUND.


[Captioner] 20:51:14
WHILE STEP UP DOES NOT EXCLUDE


[Captioner] 20:51:16
THOSE WITH SUBSTANCE USE


[Captioner] 20:51:18
DISORDERS FROM GAINING ENTRY TO


[Captioner] 20:51:20
THE PROJECT, THE HOUSING AND


[Captioner] 20:51:23
SUPPORT STEP UP PROVIDES REMOVES


[Captioner] 20:51:25
THE CHAOS OF HOMELESSNESS FROM


[Captioner] 20:51:27
PEOPLE'S LIVES, PROVIDING THEM


[Captioner] 20:51:30
WITH A STABLE ENVIRONMENT SO


[Captioner] 20:51:31
THEY CAN FOCUS THEIR ATTENTION


[Captioner] 20:51:32
ON WELLNESS AND RECOVERY.


[Captioner] 20:51:36
IN ADDITION TO THE ON-SITE


[Captioner] 20:51:38
PROPERTY MANAGERS, THE SITE WILL


[Captioner] 20:51:42
HAVE SECURITY CAMERAS, FENCING,


[Captioner] 20:51:44
AND ONE POINT OF ENTRY, WHICH


[Captioner] 20:51:46
HAS NOT BEEN THE CASE WITH THE


[Captioner] 20:51:46
MOTEL 6.


[Captioner] 20:51:52
STEP UP PROPERTIES HAVE A 97%


[Captioner] 20:51:52
RETENTION RATE AFTER ONE YEAR.


[Captioner] 20:52:04
MUCH LIKE OUR NAVIGATION CENTER,


[Captioner] 20:52:05
POTENTIAL TENANTS WILL BE


[Captioner] 20:52:07
REFERRED THROUGH THE COUNTY'S


[Captioner] 20:52:10
COORDINATED ENTRY SYSTEM, WHICH


[Captioner] 20:52:12
IDENTIFIES THE MOST VULNERABLE


[Captioner] 20:52:13
RESIDENTS WHO ARE A PRIORITY FOR


[Captioner] 20:52:15
HOUSING ASSISTANCE.


[Captioner] 20:52:18
STEP UP STAFF WILL ASSIST THE


[Captioner] 20:52:18
APPLICANTS THROUGH THE PROCESS.


[Captioner] 20:52:24
DAN IS NOW GOING TO SHARE

IF COUNCIL APPROVES THE

[Captioner] 20:53:06
RECEIVES AN AWARD, THE TEAM WILL


[Captioner] 20:53:07

[Captioner] 20:53:12
STEP UP, THE SITE OPERATOR, WILL

[Captioner] 20:54:08
IF FUNDING IS AWARDED, WE

WITHIN A COUPLE MONTHS OF


[Captioner] 20:54:13
NOTIFICATION BY THE STATE WITH

COMPLETION BY APRIL 2024, AND WE


[Captioner] 20:54:16
ANTICIPATE FULL AK UPON SATISFY


[Captioner] 20:54:19
 OCCUPANCY WOULD BE REACHED


[Captioner] 20:54:20
BY SEPTEMBER 2024.


[Captioner] 20:54:22
I WOULD ADD THAT IN THE LAST


[Captioner] 20:54:23
HOMEKEY ROUND, THE STATE MISSED


[Captioner] 20:54:25
THE DEADLINES THAT THEY HAD


[Captioner] 20:54:27
ADVERTISED SO IT'S POSSIBLE THAT

THIS WILL SLIP, BUT THAT'S THE


[Captioner] 20:54:30
SCHEDULE THAT WE HAVE NOW.


[Captioner] 20:54:38

EXEMPTION FINDINGS.


[Captioner] 20:54:49
RECOGNIZE $1 MILLION IN


[Captioner] 20:54:53
CONDITIONAL COUNTY FUNDING,


[Captioner] 20:54:55
CONDITIONALLY APPROPRIATE


[Captioner] 20:54:58
8.668 MILLION IN CITY FUNDING,


[Captioner] 20:54:59
AUTHORIZE EXECUTION OF A


[Captioner] 20:55:01
MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING WITH


[Captioner] 20:55:06

[Captioner] 20:55:12

[Captioner] 20:55:16
STAFF AS WELL AS ANDY MEYER OF

SHANGRI-LA AND AARON CRISWELL OF

[Captioner] 20:55:21
ANY QUESTIONS THAT COUNCIL MIGHT


[Captioner] 20:55:21
HAVE.


[Captioner] 20:55:22
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:55:24
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:55:26
AT THIS TIME I'LL TURN TO THE


[Captioner] 20:55:29
COUNCIL FOR QUESTIONS AND I SEE


[Captioner] 20:55:29
COUNCILMEMBER SHAO.


[Captioner] 20:55:31
>> Councilmember Shao: THANK


[Captioner] 20:55:31
YOU, MADAME MAYOR.


[Captioner] 20:55:33
THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION,


[Captioner] 20:55:35
AND MANY OF MY QUESTIONS HAVE


[Captioner] 20:55:35
BEEN ALREADY ANSWERED.


[Captioner] 20:55:39
ONE QUESTION THAT I WOULD LIKE


[Captioner] 20:55:43
TO HAVE ANSWERED IS REGARDING


[Captioner] 20:55:43
THE OPERATION FUNDS.


[Captioner] 20:55:47
I UNDERSTAND THAT THE ONE-TIME


[Captioner] 20:55:50
COMMITMENT FROM THE CITY IS


[Captioner] 20:55:50
$7.6 MILLION.


[Captioner] 20:55:58
ONCE THE PROJECT GETS RUNNING,


[Captioner] 20:56:01
HOW MUCH DOES IT COST FOR THE


[Captioner] 20:56:07
CITY TO MAINTAIN IT AS AN


[Captioner] 20:56:09
ONGOING EXPERIENCE -- EXPENSE


[Captioner] 20:56:10
INSTEAD OF ONE TIME COMMITMENT?


[Captioner] 20:56:18
>> SO THE 7.668 MILLION WILL


[Captioner] 20:56:20
COVER THE CITY'S OBLIGATION FOR


[Captioner] 20:56:20
THE FIRST FIVE YEARS.


[Captioner] 20:56:26
THE MOU THAT WE ENTER INTO WITH


[Captioner] 20:56:28
SHANGRI-LA WILL CLARIFY THAT THE


[Captioner] 20:56:30
CITY HAS NO FINANCIAL OBLIGATION


[Captioner] 20:56:32
BEYOND THE FIRST FIVE YEARS.


[Captioner] 20:56:33
IT WILL BE A PARTNERSHIP AND


[Captioner] 20:56:35
WE'LL BE WORKING WITH SHANGRI-LA


[Captioner] 20:56:39
AND STEP UP TO TRY TO SECURE


[Captioner] 20:56:41
ONGOING OPERATIONAL FUNDING, AND


[Captioner] 20:56:43
ONE IMPORTANT SOURCE WOULD BE


[Captioner] 20:56:44
HOUSING VOUCHERS.


[Captioner] 20:56:47
EITHER THAT GET AWARDED DIRECTLY


[Captioner] 20:56:50
TO THE PROPERTY OR THAT COME


[Captioner] 20:56:51
WITH SOME OF THE TENANTS, SO


[Captioner] 20:56:53
WE'LL BE WORKING DILIGENTLY TO


[Captioner] 20:56:56
TRY AND SECURE THOSE, AND THERE


[Captioner] 20:56:58
ARE MANY OTHER POTENTIAL FUNDING


[Captioner] 20:56:59
SOURCES THAT MAY MATERIALIZE.


[Captioner] 20:57:03
THERE'S A PLAN TO PUT A


[Captioner] 20:57:05
SIGNIFICANT BOND ON THE BALLOT


[Captioner] 20:57:08
IN THE NINE-COUNTY BAY AREA IN


[Captioner] 20:57:10
2024 THAT COULD BE A SIGNIFICANT


[Captioner] 20:57:11
FUNDING SOURCE.


[Captioner] 20:57:16
WE ANTICIPATE THAT SOME OF


[Captioner] 20:57:18
THE -- A GOOD CHUNK OF THE MONEY


[Captioner] 20:57:20
THAT IS DEDICATED TO SUPPORTING


[Captioner] 20:57:21
THE HOMELESS WILL SORT OF FUNNEL


[Captioner] 20:57:24
TOWARDS APPROVED HOMEKEY


[Captioner] 20:57:26
PROJECTS, AND WE'LL BE WORKING


[Captioner] 20:57:27
DILL GENTLY TO TRY TO SECURE


[Captioner] 20:57:27
THOSE.


[Captioner] 20:57:31
>> Councilmember Shao: MY


[Captioner] 20:57:32
SECOND QUESTION IS STILL


[Captioner] 20:57:32
REGARDING NUMBERS.


[Captioner] 20:57:35
WE HAVE 156 UNITS.


[Captioner] 20:57:40
DOES THAT MEAN WE WILL HAVE 156


[Captioner] 20:57:42
TENANTS IF THEY ARE FULLY


[Captioner] 20:57:43
OCCUPIED, OR COULD IT BE MORE


[Captioner] 20:57:46
THAN THAT, MEANING MULTIPLE


[Captioner] 20:57:47
PEOPLE SHARING ONE UNIT?


[Captioner] 20:57:50
>> SOME OF THE UNITS COULD HAVE


[Captioner] 20:57:52
TWO PERSONS IN THEM.


[Captioner] 20:57:54
THE PROJECTS THAT WE VISITED IN


[Captioner] 20:57:55
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA, THAT WAS


[Captioner] 20:57:55
CERTAINLY THE CASE.


[Captioner] 20:57:58
>> Councilmember Shao: SO IN


[Captioner] 20:58:01
THAT CASE, THE RATIO BETWEEN THE


[Captioner] 20:58:04
TENANTS AND THE STAFF IS -- THE


[Captioner] 20:58:07
OTHER WAY AROUND, STAFF AND


[Captioner] 20:58:09
TENANT, IS 1 TO 20, I DID THE


[Captioner] 20:58:11
ROUGH CALCULATION, SO AT LEAST


[Captioner] 20:58:13
YOU NEED 8 STAFF MEMBERS.


[Captioner] 20:58:17
WE ONLY HAVE THREE UNITS FOR --


[Captioner] 20:58:21
IN THE COMPLEX, SO FOR THOSE


[Captioner] 20:58:24
 THREE UNITS, THEY'RE JUST


[Captioner] 20:58:27
OFFICES OR DO THEY ALSO SERVE AS


[Captioner] 20:58:29
RESIDENCE FOR THE STAFF


[Captioner] 20:58:29
MEMBERS?


[Captioner] 20:58:30
I'M NOT CLEAR ON THAT.


[Captioner] 20:58:32
>> I THINK THE PLAN IS TO HAVE


[Captioner] 20:58:34
THREE ON-SITE MANAGERS OF THE


[Captioner] 20:58:34
FACILITY.


[Captioner] 20:58:36
ONE MAY BE DEALING MORE WITH THE


[Captioner] 20:58:37
ACTUAL PHYSICAL PROPERTY.


[Captioner] 20:58:41
BULL THERE WILL BE ADDITIONAL


[Captioner] 20:58:43
CASE MANAGERS.


[Captioner] 20:58:45
THEY WON'T BE LIVING ON SITE BUT


[Captioner] 20:58:48
THEY WILL BE AVAILABLE AND ON


[Captioner] 20:58:49
SITE TO SUPPORT ALL OF THE


[Captioner] 20:58:49
RESIDENTS.


[Captioner] 20:58:50
>> Councilmember Shao: OKAY,


[Captioner] 20:58:52
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:58:55
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:58:58
NEXT IS COUNCILMEMBER KENG.


[Captioner] 20:58:59
CLARIFYING QUESTIONS, THANK


[Captioner] 20:58:59
YOU.


[Captioner] 20:59:01
>> Councilmember Keng: THANK


[Captioner] 20:59:02
YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE


[Captioner] 20:59:02
PRESENTATION.


[Captioner] 20:59:03
I DO HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS.


[Captioner] 20:59:07
FIRST IS THE PROGRAM GOING TO


[Captioner] 20:59:08
PRIORITIZE FREMONT RESIDENTS,


[Captioner] 20:59:11
AND IF THERE'S ANY REQUIREMENTS


[Captioner] 20:59:14
SUCH AS INCOME, BECAUSE I SAW


[Captioner] 20:59:17
THAT THERE WERE -- THE


[Captioner] 20:59:19
MANAGEMENT ALSO IS RESPONSIBLE


[Captioner] 20:59:21
FOR COLLECTING RENT, IS THAT


[Captioner] 20:59:21
CORRECT?


[Captioner] 20:59:23
AND THEN -- SO THERE'S -- IF


[Captioner] 20:59:26
THERE'S AN INCOME REQUIREMENT,


[Captioner] 20:59:28
AND THEN ALSO ON THE FORM, I DID


[Captioner] 20:59:31
SEE THAT THERE IS A LOT OF


[Captioner] 20:59:34
CONCERNS ABOUT SAFETY, SO WHAT


[Captioner] 20:59:36
ARE SOME OF -- PERHAPS THE CHIEF


[Captioner] 20:59:38
CAN HELP US, WHAT ARE SOME OF


[Captioner] 20:59:41
THE PLANS IN PLACE THAT WE HAVE


[Captioner] 20:59:44
TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF THE


[Captioner] 20:59:45
NEIGHBORHOOD, BECAUSE CHANGE IS


[Captioner] 20:59:47
ALWAYS HARD, AND IF WE -- I KNOW


[Captioner] 20:59:48
THAT WE WILL HAVE OUTREACH


[Captioner] 20:59:50
PROGRAMS LATER ON, BUT WE ALSO


[Captioner] 20:59:54
WANT TO KIND OF SHARE IF WE HAVE


[Captioner] 20:59:55
SOME OF THESE PLANS IN PLACE.


[Captioner] 21:00:08
 GENTLEMEN SO I THINK THE 


[Captioner] 21:00:09
COUNCIL IS PRIORITIZING MAKING 


[Captioner] 21:00:11
SURE WE ARE PROVIDING SHELTERS 


[Captioner] 21:00:13
FOR OUR IN SHELTER NEIGHBORS.


[Captioner] 21:00:14
I THINK THIS IS KIND OF A 


[Captioner] 21:00:16
PROGRAM THAT IS STEMMING FROM, 


[Captioner] 21:00:19
YOU KNOW, DURING THE PANDEMIC WE 


[Captioner] 21:00:22
HAD A KIND OF A SIMILAR HOMEKEY 


[Captioner] 21:00:24
PROGRAM, YOU KNOW, THAT ARE SET 


[Captioner] 21:00:26
UP AT HOALGHTS THAT WERE 


[Captioner] 21:00:28
UNOCCUPIED AT THE TIME AND SO 


[Captioner] 21:00:30
PERHAPS IF WE HAVE SOME OF THOSE 


[Captioner] 21:00:33
DATA THAT WE CAN SHARE ABOUT THE 


[Captioner] 21:00:35
SUCCESS DURING THAT TIME, AND I 


[Captioner] 21:00:37
THINK THIS IS KIND OF THE IDEA 


[Captioner] 21:00:39
THAT STEMMED FROM THAT PROVIDING 


[Captioner] 21:00:42
THE STUDIOS, STUDIO SETUPS, THAT 


[Captioner] 21:00:43
EACH PERSON HAS THEIR PERSONAL 


[Captioner] 21:00:43
SPACE.


[Captioner] 21:00:45
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 21:00:50
>> Suzanne Shenfil:   SO THAT 


[Captioner] 21:00:53
WAS ABOUT FIVE QUESTIONS IN ONE.


[Captioner] 21:00:55
SO I'M GOING TO TACKLE ONE OF 


[Captioner] 21:00:58
THEM, LAURIE MAY TACKLE THE 


[Captioner] 21:01:00
OTHER THE CHIEF MAY ADD HIS 


[Captioner] 21:01:01
VOICE AS WELL.


[Captioner] 21:01:03
SO THESE I THINK HAVING AN 


[Captioner] 21:01:05
INCOME IS NOT A REQUIREMENT.


[Captioner] 21:01:07
GENERALLY SPEAKING, THESE UNITS 


[Captioner] 21:01:10
ARE GOING TO TARGET PEOPLE AT 


[Captioner] 21:01:12
15% OF MEDIAN AND BELOW.


[Captioner] 21:01:15
SO SOME MAY BE ON SOCIAL, SOME 


[Captioner] 21:01:19
 


[Captioner] 21:01:21
SECURITY, SOME MAY GETTING 


[Captioner] 21:01:23
DISABILITY PAYMENTS, SOME MAY 


[Captioner] 21:01:26
HAVE NO INCOME.


[Captioner] 21:01:28
AND PART OF WHAT STEP UP STAFF 


[Captioner] 21:01:30
WILL BE DOING IS IF THEY ARE 


[Captioner] 21:01:32
ENTITLED TO RECEIVE THAT KIND OF 


[Captioner] 21:01:35
FUNDING, AND THAT THE TENANTS 


[Captioner] 21:01:37
WILL BE PAYING A PERCENTAGE OF 


[Captioner] 21:01:38
THEIR INCOME TOWARDS RENT.


[Captioner] 21:01:40
SO THEY WILL PAY RENT BASED ON 


[Captioner] 21:01:42
WHAT THEIR INCOME IS.


[Captioner] 21:01:44
IF THEIR INCOME GOES UP, THEN 


[Captioner] 21:01:53
THEIR RENTAL AMOUNTS WILL GO UP.


[Captioner] 21:01:55
DO YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE --


[Captioner] 21:01:57
>> YES, AS PART OF OUR SYSTEM OF 


[Captioner] 21:01:59
CARE, WITHIN OUR CURRENT SYSTEM, 


[Captioner] 21:02:03
CLIENT PREFERENCE IS INCLUDED IN 


[Captioner] 21:02:04
THE VULNERABILITY SCORE AND HOW 


[Captioner] 21:02:06
WE ARE MATCHING OUR CHRONICALLY 


[Captioner] 21:02:08
HOMELESS RESIDENTS TO HOUSING.


[Captioner] 21:02:10
AND WITHIN FREMONT, AND IT'S 


[Captioner] 21:02:13
TRUE MANY COMMUNITIES THOSE ARE 


[Captioner] 21:02:15
WITHIN FREMONT WANT TO BE HOUSED 


[Captioner] 21:02:16
IN FREMONT.


[Captioner] 21:02:18
SO CLIENT PREFERENCE IS TAKEN 


[Captioner] 21:02:18
INTO CONSIDERATION.


[Captioner] 21:02:20
AND WE ARE ALSO WORKING WITH THE 


[Captioner] 21:02:23
STATE AND COUNTY AGENCIES ON OUR 


[Captioner] 21:02:24
ACTUAL PRIORITIZATION AND THE 


[Captioner] 21:02:27
SET ASIDES EXCLUSIVELY FOR 


[Captioner] 21:02:29
FREMONT AND THE INTENTION OF 


[Captioner] 21:02:30
THIS IS TO HOUSE FREMONT 


[Captioner] 21:02:31
RESIDENTS.


[Captioner] 21:02:33
REGARDING YOUR QUESTION AROUND 


[Captioner] 21:02:35
PROJECT ROOM KEY WHICH YES IT 


[Captioner] 21:02:37
WAS A RESPONSE DURING COVID 


[Captioner] 21:02:39
BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF OPTIONS 


[Captioner] 21:02:41
TO SHELTER IN PLACE, RIGHT?


[Captioner] 21:02:43
SO PROJECT ROOM KEY WAS BORN AND 


[Captioner] 21:02:44
THEN BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF 


[Captioner] 21:02:45
OPPORTUNITIES AND OPTIONS FOR 


[Captioner] 21:02:48
PEOPLE TO HOUSE AFTERWARDS, 


[Captioner] 21:02:49
HOMEKEY WAS BORN.


[Captioner] 21:02:51
AND SO THERE IS INFORMATION ON 


[Captioner] 21:02:53
THE SUCCESS OF PROJECT ROOM KEY, 


[Captioner] 21:02:55
I'M HAPPY TO SHARE THAT WITH YOU 


[Captioner] 21:02:56
AFTERWARDS AS WELL.


[Captioner] 21:03:10
>> Sean Washington:   WELL, GOOD 


[Captioner] 21:03:12
EVENING, MAYOR, COUNCILMEMBERS 


[Captioner] 21:03:13
AND OUR COMMUNITY.


[Captioner] 21:03:16
SO IN PREPARATION FOR TONIGHT'S 


[Captioner] 21:03:18
MEETING, YOU KNOW, I'VE HAD 


[Captioner] 21:03:19
SEVERAL CONVERSATIONS AND 


[Captioner] 21:03:20
INTERACTIONS WITH OUR COMMUNITY 


[Captioner] 21:03:22
WHICH I THOUGHT WAS IMPORTANT.


[Captioner] 21:03:24
BECAUSE I'VE READ THE COMMENTS 


[Captioner] 21:03:26
AND CERTAINLY HAVE HAD 


[Captioner] 21:03:27
CONVERSATIONS WITH MEMBERS OF 


[Captioner] 21:03:30
OUR COMMUNITIES WITH CONCERNS 


[Captioner] 21:03:31
ABOUT PUBLIC SAFETY.


[Captioner] 21:03:33
AND OBVIOUSLY AS A POLICE CHIEF 


[Captioner] 21:03:35
THAT'S WHAT I'M RESPONSIBLE FOR.


[Captioner] 21:03:37
SO I PREPARED A FEW NOTES FOR 


[Captioner] 21:03:40
YOU ALL TONIGHT AND THE 


[Captioner] 21:03:41
COMMUNITY, JUST TO PROVIDE A 


[Captioner] 21:03:44
LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND AND 


[Captioner] 21:03:47
PERSPECTIVE IN, YOU KNOW, HOW I 


[Captioner] 21:03:49
WENT ABOUT ASSESSING THIS 


[Captioner] 21:03:50
PARTICULAR PROGRAM AND WHY I 


[Captioner] 21:03:52
BELIEVE IT IS A BENEFIT TO OUR 


[Captioner] 21:03:53
COMMUNITY.


[Captioner] 21:03:56
SO AGAIN, RECOGNIZING THE 


[Captioner] 21:03:57
CONCERN FROM SOME OF OUR 


[Captioner] 21:03:59
COMMUNITY MEMBERS, YOU KNOW, I 


[Captioner] 21:04:01
TOOK GREATLY CARE IN ASSESSING 


[Captioner] 21:04:03
POTENTIAL SAFETY, PUBLIC SAFETY 


[Captioner] 21:04:05
ISSUES, THAT HAVE BEEN 


[Captioner] 21:04:06
ARTICULATED.


[Captioner] 21:04:09
YOU KNOW, OUR OBJECTIVE AS A 


[Captioner] 21:04:10
POLICE DEPARTMENT REMAINS TO DO 


[Captioner] 21:04:12
ALL WE CAN TO SUPPORT OUR 


[Captioner] 21:04:15
COMMUNITY AND THE DEPARTMENT'S 


[Captioner] 21:04:15
PUBLIC SAFETY GOALS.


[Captioner] 21:04:17
I'LL START BY SAYING THAT, YOU 


[Captioner] 21:04:20
KNOW, AS A LAW ENFORCEMENT 


[Captioner] 21:04:22
PROFESSIONAL, YOU KNOW, WE ARE 


[Captioner] 21:04:24
RESPONSIBLE FOR PROVIDING PUBLIC 


[Captioner] 21:04:27
SAFETY, UTILIZING FAIR TREATMENT 


[Captioner] 21:04:30
OF ALL PERSONS NO MATTER THEIR 


[Captioner] 21:04:33
RACE, RELIGION, WHO THEY LOVE OR 


[Captioner] 21:04:34
THEIR SOCIAL ECONOMIC STATUS.


[Captioner] 21:04:37
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE 


[Captioner] 21:04:40
UNDERSTAND THAT, ALSO THAT ALL 


[Captioner] 21:04:42
HUMAN BEINGS CAN CAUSE HARM AND 


[Captioner] 21:04:43
THEN THEREFORE SHOULD BE HELD 


[Captioner] 21:04:44
ACCOUNTABLE.


[Captioner] 21:04:45
BUT I WANT TO GUARD AGAINST 


[Captioner] 21:04:50
MAKING ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT PERSONS 


[Captioner] 21:04:53
 


[Captioner] 21:04:55
PROPENSITY BASED ON THEIR 


[Captioner] 21:04:57
ECONOMIC STATUS.


[Captioner] 21:05:00
I WANT TO MAKE SURE AS I GO 


[Captioner] 21:05:01
THROUGH THIS THAT THIS IS 


[Captioner] 21:05:02
PLAYING IN THE BACKGROUND.


[Captioner] 21:05:04
IN THE FAST FEW WEEKS AGAIN IN 


[Captioner] 21:05:05
PREPARATION FOR THIS DISCUSSION 


[Captioner] 21:05:06
AND AFTER SPEAKING TO MANY OF 


[Captioner] 21:05:08
THE COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND 


[Captioner] 21:05:09
GETTING E-MAILS PHONE CALLS AND 


[Captioner] 21:05:12
VOICE MAILS, YOU KNOW, I 


[Captioner] 21:05:13
CONNECTED WITH SEVERAL LAW 


[Captioner] 21:05:14
ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES LIKE 


[Captioner] 21:05:16
SUZANNE TALKED ABOUT HAVING 


[Captioner] 21:05:18
SIMILAR PROJECTS AND PROGRAMS.


[Captioner] 21:05:20
AND IT WAS IMPORTANT FOR ME TO 


[Captioner] 21:05:22
DO THAT AS THE CHIEF SO I CAN 


[Captioner] 21:05:25
GET THAT ONE ON ONE REAL FRANK 


[Captioner] 21:05:26
CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE 


[Captioner] 21:05:28
EXPERIENCING.


[Captioner] 21:05:30
SO AS ARTICULATED BY THESE LAW 


[Captioner] 21:05:33
ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES, THE 


[Captioner] 21:05:34
PREPONDERANCE OF THE RESEARCH 


[Captioner] 21:05:36
AND EVIDENCE REVEALED AN 


[Captioner] 21:05:39
IMPROVEMENT IN THE AREA AND A 


[Captioner] 21:05:41
DECREASE IN THE SEVERITY AND 


[Captioner] 21:05:43
TYPES OF CRIMES ASSOCIATED WITH 


[Captioner] 21:05:44
THAT AREA.


[Captioner] 21:05:45
YOU KNOW, SO IT'S KIND OF THE 


[Captioner] 21:05:47
BEFORE AND AFTER EFFECT.


[Captioner] 21:05:50
I DO RECOGNIZE HOWEVER, SOME 


[Captioner] 21:05:52
CITIES DID NOT NECESSARILY 


[Captioner] 21:05:53
EXPERIENCE THAT, RIGHT?


[Captioner] 21:05:56
SO IT WASN'T 100% BUT AGAIN, 


[Captioner] 21:06:00
THAT WAS THE EXCEPTION IN MY 


[Captioner] 21:06:02
RESEARCH AND CONVERSATIONS WITH 


[Captioner] 21:06:04
OTHER POLICE CHIEFS AND OTHER 


[Captioner] 21:06:05
LAW ENFORCEMENT PROFESSIONALS 


[Captioner] 21:06:07
THROUGHOUT THE STATE.


[Captioner] 21:06:08
WHAT SEEMED TO BE PRESENT IN ALL 


[Captioner] 21:06:13
OF THESE CONVERSATIONS WAS 


[Captioner] 21:06:16
SUCCESSFUL PROGRAMS REQUIRED AND 


[Captioner] 21:06:19
HAD THE PRESENCE OF GOOD SOLID 


[Captioner] 21:06:22
MANAGEMENT, COOPERATION BETWEEN 


[Captioner] 21:06:25
CITY STAFF, THE PROJECT LEAD, 


[Captioner] 21:06:27
THE PROJECT MANAGER, AND ALSO, 


[Captioner] 21:06:29
THE STAKEHOLDERS IN OUR 


[Captioner] 21:06:30
COMMUNITY LISTENING TO OUR 


[Captioner] 21:06:30
COMMUNITY.


[Captioner] 21:06:32
THAT SEEMED TO BE PRESENT IN ALL 


[Captioner] 21:06:34
OF THE PROGRAMS THAT WERE 


[Captioner] 21:06:36
ARTICULATING GREAT SUCCESS.


[Captioner] 21:06:40
SO OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS WE'VE 


[Captioner] 21:06:42
ALSO STUDIED SOME OF THE 


[Captioner] 21:06:42
AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS WITHIN 


[Captioner] 21:06:45
OUR CITY AND WE REALLY HAVE NOT 


[Captioner] 21:06:47
IDENTIFIED A CAUSE FOR CONCERN 


[Captioner] 21:06:49
OR PUBLIC SAFETY ISSUE WITH THE 


[Captioner] 21:06:51
CURRENT PROGRAMS AND SITES THAT 


[Captioner] 21:06:54
WE HAVE THROUGHOUT OUR CITY.


[Captioner] 21:06:56
THESE PROGRAMS REQUIRE POLICE 


[Captioner] 21:06:57
SERVICES SIMILAR TO WHAT IS 


[Captioner] 21:07:00
FOUND IN ANY OTHER HIGH DENSITY 


[Captioner] 21:07:01
PROPERTY OR SITE FOUND 


[Captioner] 21:07:04
THROUGHOUT OUR CITY.


[Captioner] 21:07:06
SO THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE THERE 


[Captioner] 21:07:07
AS FAR AS THE PUBLIC SAFETY 


[Captioner] 21:07:09
PERSPECTIVE.


[Captioner] 21:07:12
BUT WE HAVE ESTABLISHED AND HAVE 


[Captioner] 21:07:14
PROVEN PROGRAMS IN PLACE WHICH 


[Captioner] 21:07:17
MAY APPLY TO THIS AND OTHER 


[Captioner] 21:07:19
MULTIUNIT HOUSING SITES 


[Captioner] 21:07:21
THROUGHOUT OUR CITY.


[Captioner] 21:07:23
WE OFTEN DO CRIME PREVENTION 


[Captioner] 21:07:24
THROUGH ENVIRONMENTAL DESIGN 


[Captioner] 21:07:26
ASSESSMENTS FOR FREE OF CHARGE 


[Captioner] 21:07:28
AT HIGH DENSITY AREAS AND THAT'S 


[Captioner] 21:07:31
REALLY DESIGNING AND BEING 


[Captioner] 21:07:33
PARTICIPATORY IN HOW A PROPERTY 


[Captioner] 21:07:35
IS DESIGNED TO HELP MITIGATE ANY 


[Captioner] 21:07:37
OF THE CRIMINAL -- THE CRIME 


[Captioner] 21:07:38
CONCERNS.


[Captioner] 21:07:39
OBVIOUSLY NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH AND 


[Captioner] 21:07:43
VIDEO CAMERA REGISTRATIONS WE 


[Captioner] 21:07:46
RELY HEAVILY ON OUR CRIME 


[Captioner] 21:07:47
REDUCTION TEAMS IF NEEDED AND 


[Captioner] 21:07:49
THEN OUR COMMUNITY CONNECTIONS 


[Captioner] 21:07:51
PROGRAM WHICH IS A FROL BASED 


[Captioner] 21:07:53
PROGRAM THAT IF ISSUES DO ARISE 


[Captioner] 21:07:55
THEN WE CAN QUICKLY ASSESS AND 


[Captioner] 21:07:57
ADDRESS.


[Captioner] 21:08:00
SO THESE ARE PROGRAMS WE OFFER 


[Captioner] 21:08:01
AND ENCOURAGE THROUGHOUT OUR 


[Captioner] 21:08:04
CITY IN ALL AREAS MEANING SO 


[Captioner] 21:08:07
AFFORDABLE HOUSING, NEW 


[Captioner] 21:08:08
CONSTRUCTION, IT DOESN'T MATTER 


[Captioner] 21:08:10
THROUGHOUT THE CITY WE OFFER 


[Captioner] 21:08:12
THESE PROGRAMS AND SITES AS OUR 


[Captioner] 21:08:14
CONCERNS FOR COMMUNITY PUBLIC 


[Captioner] 21:08:17
SAFETY IS ONGOING.


[Captioner] 21:08:21
IT'S ALSO GOOD TO UNDERSTAND 


[Captioner] 21:08:24
THAT WITH LIMITATIONS ON THE 


[Captioner] 21:08:25
STAFFING THAT I HAVE AVAILABLE I 


[Captioner] 21:08:26
CERTAINLY HAVE A GREATLY 


[Captioner] 21:08:28
INTEREST IN ENSURING THAT I 


[Captioner] 21:08:30
DEPLOY RESOURCES AS EFFICIENTLY 


[Captioner] 21:08:32
AS POSSIBILITY.


[Captioner] 21:08:34
SO TO BE CLEAR, YOU KNOW, THE 


[Captioner] 21:08:36
TYPE OF CALLS THAT CONSUME 


[Captioner] 21:08:40
RESOURCES, WE TYPICALLY GET ARE 


[Captioner] 21:08:42
THE PERSONS WHO ARE ACTUALLY 


[Captioner] 21:08:43
UNHOUSED, RIGHT?


[Captioner] 21:08:45
THEY'RE NOT IN A FACILITY.


[Captioner] 21:08:46
THEY DON'T HAVE THAT SUPPORT.


[Captioner] 21:08:48
THAT'S THE BULK OF OUR CALLS FOR 


[Captioner] 21:08:50
SERVICE THAT WE GET.


[Captioner] 21:08:53
IN A DAY IN AND DAY OUT BASIS.


[Captioner] 21:08:56
SO FROM YOU KNOW REALLY THE 


[Captioner] 21:08:59
PUBLIC SAFETY PERSPECTIVE, YOU 


[Captioner] 21:09:00
KNOW, EVIDENCE SUPPORTS THE NEED 


[Captioner] 21:09:02
TO GET PEOPLE INSIDE AND OFF OF 


[Captioner] 21:09:05
OUR STREETS.


[Captioner] 21:09:07
SO IN CLOSING, I DO UNDERSTAND 


[Captioner] 21:09:08
THAT CONCERNS OF OUR COMMUNITY 


[Captioner] 21:09:10
MEMBERS AND I REMAIN OPEN TO 


[Captioner] 21:09:12
HEARING THAT AND ENGAGING WITH 


[Captioner] 21:09:13
OUR COMMUNITY.


[Captioner] 21:09:15
HOWEVER I AM RELATIVELY 


[Captioner] 21:09:17
CONFIDENT THAT WITH PROPER 


[Captioner] 21:09:20
MANAGEMENT AND COOPERATION INPUT 


[Captioner] 21:09:24
BY FPD, WE'LL BE CONSIDERED TO 


[Captioner] 21:09:25
MITIGATE ANTICIPATED AND 


[Captioner] 21:09:26
UNANTICIPATED ISSUES THAT MAY 


[Captioner] 21:09:28
ARISE.


[Captioner] 21:09:30
SO WE WILL DEVOTE TIME AND 


[Captioner] 21:09:32
RESOURCES TO HELP ENSURE THE 


[Captioner] 21:09:34
SUCCESS OF THIS INITIATIVE IF IT 


[Captioner] 21:09:36
DOES GO FORWARD.


[Captioner] 21:09:38
AND WE UNDERSTAND THE LONG TERM 


[Captioner] 21:09:39
PUBLIC SAFETY BENEFITS OF THESE 


[Captioner] 21:09:41
TYPE OF PROGRAMS AS WE MOVE 


[Captioner] 21:09:42
FORWARD.


[Captioner] 21:09:43
SO I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY 


[Captioner] 21:09:45
TO SHARE MY PERSPECTIVE.


[Captioner] 21:09:46
I THOUGHT IT WAS IMPORTANT TO 


[Captioner] 21:09:48
KIND OF GIVE AN OVERALL OVERVIEW 


[Captioner] 21:09:51
OF HOW I ARRIVED AT THIS TYPE OF 


[Captioner] 21:09:52
PERSPECTIVE.


[Captioner] 21:09:56
SO THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 21:09:57
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU FOR 


[Captioner] 21:09:58
THE CLARIFYING RESPONSES.


[Captioner] 21:10:01
NEXT IS COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN.


[Captioner] 21:10:03
CLARIFYING QUESTIONS.


[Captioner] 21:10:05
>> Councilmember Salwan:   THANK 


[Captioner] 21:10:06
YOU MADAM MAYOR AND THANK YOU 


[Captioner] 21:10:08
FOR THE PRESENTATION.


[Captioner] 21:10:09
JUST HAD A QUESTION.


[Captioner] 21:10:12
WE USE THE WORD STEP UP AND 


[Captioner] 21:10:14
SHANGRI-LA INTERCHANGEABLY.


[Captioner] 21:10:15
IS IT TWO DIFFERENT 


[Captioner] 21:10:16
ORGANIZATIONS, IS ONE THE 


[Captioner] 21:10:18
HOUSING AND THE OTHER IS THE 


[Captioner] 21:10:22
SERVICE OR HOW DOES THAT WORK?


[Captioner] 21:10:23
>> Suzanne Shenfil:   SHANGRI-LA 


[Captioner] 21:10:26
IS A DEVELOPMENT COMPANY, THE 


[Captioner] 21:10:28
DEVELOPER AND STEP UP IS THE 


[Captioner] 21:10:29
SERVICE FROIRD THAT WILL BE 


[Captioner] 21:10:30
MANAGING THE PROPERTY AND 


[Captioner] 21:10:32
PROVIDING SUPPORTIVE SERVICES TO 


[Captioner] 21:10:34
THE RESIDENTS.


[Captioner] 21:10:35
>> Councilmember Salwan:   OKAY 


[Captioner] 21:10:37
SO ULTIMATELY THEY WILL OWN AND 


[Captioner] 21:10:39
OPERATE THE PROPERTY AND IT WILL 


[Captioner] 21:10:40
BE AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS FOR 


[Captioner] 21:10:42
55 YEARS, IS THAT -- IS THAT 


[Captioner] 21:10:43
RIGHT?


[Captioner] 21:10:44
>> Suzanne Shenfil:   YES, 


[Captioner] 21:10:46
CORRECT.


[Captioner] 21:10:47
>> Councilmember Salwan:   OKAY 


[Captioner] 21:10:48
GOOD.


[Captioner] 21:10:50
I APPRECIATE THE FRAMING OF THIS 


[Captioner] 21:10:51
BEING AN AFFORDABLE HOUSING 


[Captioner] 21:10:55
PROJECT AND THIS I GUESS 


[Captioner] 21:10:56
SPECIFICALLY TARGETS EXTREMELY 


[Captioner] 21:10:58
LOW AND VERY LOW INCOME IS THAT 


[Captioner] 21:10:59
RIGHT?


[Captioner] 21:11:00
>> Suzanne Shenfil:   YES.


[Captioner] 21:11:00
>> Councilmember Salwan:   I 


[Captioner] 21:11:02
NOTICED THAT ON THE OTHER TWO 


[Captioner] 21:11:04
PROJECTS IT VERY CLEARLY 


[Captioner] 21:11:06
MENTIONS THAT IT'S PERMANENT 


[Captioner] 21:11:07
 


[Captioner] 21:11:09
SUPPORTIVE HOUSING FOR 


[Captioner] 21:11:10
CHRONICALLY HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS 


[Captioner] 21:11:13
OR FOLKS AT RISK OF 


[Captioner] 21:11:14
HOMELESSNESS.


[Captioner] 21:11:16
IS OUR PROJECT TARGETED FOR 


[Captioner] 21:11:20
THOSE SPECIFIC FOLKS AS WELL?


[Captioner] 21:11:22
>> YES CONDITION FOR THE 


[Captioner] 21:11:25
CHRONICALLY HOMELESS 


[Captioner] 21:11:25
DESIGNATION.


[Captioner] 21:11:26
>> Councilmember Salwan:   I 


[Captioner] 21:11:28
THINK PART OF THE ANGST IS WE 


[Captioner] 21:11:31
HAVE CRONL CLI HOMELESS FOLKS -- 


[Captioner] 21:11:33
CHRONICALLY HOMELESS FOLKS IN 


[Captioner] 21:11:34
FREMONT AND FOLKS WOULD LIKE TO 


[Captioner] 21:11:37
SEE THEM HOUSED IN FREMONT.


[Captioner] 21:11:40
SO HOW DO WE ENSURE OUR 


[Captioner] 21:11:41
RESIDENTS THAT WE ARE GOING TO 


[Captioner] 21:11:43
TAKE SOME OF THESE FOLKS IN OUR 


[Captioner] 21:11:44
LIBRARIES OR LIVING OFTEN THE 


[Captioner] 21:11:46
STREETS OR PARKS AND HOW DO WE 


[Captioner] 21:11:48
GET THEM INDOORS INTO ONE OF 


[Captioner] 21:11:50
THESE SITES, HOW DO YOU ENSURE 


[Captioner] 21:11:53
THOSE FOR OUR RESIDENTS?


[Captioner] 21:11:55
>> SOMETHING WE LEARNED FROM 


[Captioner] 21:11:56
 RED 


[Captioner] 21:11:58
LANLDZ, THE PROJECT THAT CITY 


[Captioner] 21:12:00
HAD WITH STEP UP, THE 


[Captioner] 21:12:03
PARTNERSHIP IS TARGETED TO 


[Captioner] 21:12:04
ASSESS WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR 


[Captioner] 21:12:05
HOUSING, DETERMINING WHETHER OR 


[Captioner] 21:12:07
NOT THEY ARE CHRONICALLY 


[Captioner] 21:12:09
HOMELESS OR CONSIDERED 


[Captioner] 21:12:11
VULNERABLE WHICH ARE OFTEN OUR 


[Captioner] 21:12:14
ELDERS, PEOPLE AGING OUTSIDE, 


[Captioner] 21:12:16
PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC DISABILITIES 


[Captioner] 21:12:17
OR CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITIONS 


[Captioner] 21:12:19
WHICH IS 48% OF PEOPLE WHO ARE 


[Captioner] 21:12:21
EXPERIENCING UNSHELTERED 


[Captioner] 21:12:23
HOMELESSNESS IN FREMONT.


[Captioner] 21:12:25
SO IT IS GOING TO BE A ROBUST 


[Captioner] 21:12:26
OUTREACH EFFORT AND TARGETED TO 


[Captioner] 21:12:29
AREAS WITH LONG CONGREGATIONS OF 


[Captioner] 21:12:32
OUR UNSHELTERED HOMELESS AND 


[Captioner] 21:12:33
ENSURING THEY ARE ASSESSED AND 


[Captioner] 21:12:34
THEY HAVE THE APPROPRIATE 


[Captioner] 21:12:36
DOCUMENTS TO APPLY FOR PROGRAM 


[Captioner] 21:12:37
AND THAT WOULD BE IN PARTNERSHIP 


[Captioner] 21:12:39
WITH THE CITY AND STEP UP AND 


[Captioner] 21:12:42
OUR OTHER OUTREACH PROVIDERS AS 


[Captioner] 21:12:42
WELL.


[Captioner] 21:12:43
>> Councilmember Salwan:   IS 


[Captioner] 21:12:45
THAT SOMETHING WE CAN DO FRO 


[Captioner] 21:12:46
ACTIVELY EVEN PRIOR TO THIS 


[Captioner] 21:12:48
PROJECT PROCEEDING SO WE HAVE 


[Captioner] 21:12:51
PEOPLE LINED UP ALREADY?


[Captioner] 21:12:52
>> Suzanne Shenfil:   


[Captioner] 21:12:52
ABSOLUTELY.


[Captioner] 21:12:53
>> Councilmember Salwan:   THAT 


[Captioner] 21:12:55
WOULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE.


[Captioner] 21:12:57
IF WE CAN COMBAT HOMELESSNESS IN 


[Captioner] 21:12:59
FREMONT I THINK THAT IS A GRADE 


[Captioner] 21:13:00
MOLE.


[Captioner] 21:13:02
THE OTHER ISSUE IS THE FOLKS IN 


[Captioner] 21:13:03
WARM SPRINGS.


[Captioner] 21:13:05
THIS IS A PROJECT THAT IS IN 


[Captioner] 21:13:06
WARM SPRINGS AND THERE IS A LOT 


[Captioner] 21:13:08
OF HOMELESSNESS AROUND THE BART 


[Captioner] 21:13:09
STATION AND A LOT OF THOSE 


[Captioner] 21:13:10
INDUSTRIAL PROPERTIES.


[Captioner] 21:13:12
IS THERE A WAY TO AGAIN BUILD 


[Captioner] 21:13:14
THE CASE HOW WE CAN MAKE THIS 


[Captioner] 21:13:16
SUCCESSFUL BY MINIMIZING SOME OF 


[Captioner] 21:13:18
THE HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS AROUND 


[Captioner] 21:13:19
THOSE AREAS SO THAT WAY THERE IS 


[Captioner] 21:13:20
NOT IMPACT TO OUR NEIGHBORS AND 


[Captioner] 21:13:22
WE CAN GET THEM INDOORS.


[Captioner] 21:13:23
IS THAT SOMETHING THAT WE'LL BE 


[Captioner] 21:13:25
WORKING TOWARDS AS WELL?


[Captioner] 21:13:26
>> Suzanne Shenfil:   I THINK WE 


[Captioner] 21:13:28
CAN REALLY TARGET HIGHLY 


[Captioner] 21:13:29
IMPACTED AREAS.


[Captioner] 21:13:30
NOT JUST IN WARM SPRINGS BUT WE 


[Captioner] 21:13:32
HAVE THEM IN OTHER DISTRICTS AS 


[Captioner] 21:13:33
WELL.


[Captioner] 21:13:36
SO AS LAURIE SAID DOING VERY 


[Captioner] 21:13:38
ROBUST OUTREACH AND MAKING SURE 


[Captioner] 21:13:40
PEOPLE ARE DOCUMENT-READY THAT 


[Captioner] 21:13:42
THEY HAVE ALL THE DOCUMENTATION 


[Captioner] 21:13:45
IN PLACE AND THAT WHEN THE UNITS 


[Captioner] 21:13:47
ARE AVAILABLE, THEY'RE READY TO 


[Captioner] 21:13:49
MOVE IN.


[Captioner] 21:13:50
>> Councilmember Salwan:   OKAY.


[Captioner] 21:13:52
AND THEN JUST THE LAST FOLLOW UP 


[Captioner] 21:13:53
TO THE CHIEF'S QUESTION.


[Captioner] 21:13:55
I THINK PREVIOUSLY YOU HAD A 


[Captioner] 21:13:57
STATISTIC OF THE CALLS FOR 


[Captioner] 21:13:59
SERVICE TO MOTEL 6 NOW VERSUS 


[Captioner] 21:14:01
ONE OF THE SITES, WITH THE 


[Captioner] 21:14:02
POTENTIAL DIFFERENCE WOULD BE.


[Captioner] 21:14:04
AND WOULD THIS BE -- WOULD THIS 


[Captioner] 21:14:05
MAKE IT SAFER FOR OUR RESIDENTS 


[Captioner] 21:14:07
OR WOULD IT MAKE IT WORSE THAN 


[Captioner] 21:14:10
WHAT IT IS NOW?


[Captioner] 21:14:11
>> Sean Washington:   YES SO WE 


[Captioner] 21:14:12
DID HAVE SOME STATISTICS A 


[Captioner] 21:14:13
COUPLE OF YEARS AGO AS FAR AS 


[Captioner] 21:14:15
THE CALLS FOR SERVICE WHEN THE 


[Captioner] 21:14:16
HOTEL WAS UP AND OPERATING AND 


[Captioner] 21:14:20
WE HAD TO RESPOND TO CALLS FOR 


[Captioner] 21:14:21
SERVICE.


[Captioner] 21:14:23
THE DIFFICULTY IS WE HAVE THE 


[Captioner] 21:14:24
BEFORE BUT WE DON'T HAVE THE 


[Captioner] 21:14:27
AFTER, RIGHT, TO COMPARE IT.


[Captioner] 21:14:28
SO THIS IS NOT -- BUT ALL WE 


[Captioner] 21:14:30
HAVE TO RELY ON IS OUR 


[Captioner] 21:14:32
EXPERIENCE WITH OTHER SIMILAR 


[Captioner] 21:14:34
PROGRAMS THROUGHOUT THE STATE.


[Captioner] 21:14:37
AND THEN SOME OF THE SIMILAR 


[Captioner] 21:14:39
PROGRAMS THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE 


[Captioner] 21:14:40
IN THE CITY.


[Captioner] 21:14:43
AND SO FROM THE LAW ENFORCEMENT 


[Captioner] 21:14:45
PERSPECTIVE, AGAIN, THE BULK OF 


[Captioner] 21:14:47
OUR CALLS ARE NOT TO THESE 


[Captioner] 21:14:48
FACILITIES.


[Captioner] 21:14:50
THEY ARE VERY COMPARABLE TO WHAT 


[Captioner] 21:14:51
WE'VE EXPERIENCED AT ANY HIGH 


[Captioner] 21:14:53
DENSITY AREA THROUGHOUT OUR 


[Captioner] 21:14:53
CITY.


[Captioner] 21:14:56
AND SO WE CAN ONLY, YOU KNOW, 


[Captioner] 21:14:56



[Captioner] 21:14:58
BASED ON THE EVIDENCE AND THE 


[Captioner] 21:15:00
COMMUNICATION, WITH THESE OTHER 


[Captioner] 21:15:02
SITES THROUGHOUT THE STATE, YOU 


[Captioner] 21:15:03
KNOW I'M PRETTY CONFIDENT THAT 


[Captioner] 21:15:05
WE WILL SEE THE SAME RESULTS 


[Captioner] 21:15:06
WITH PROPER MANAGEMENT, 


[Captioner] 21:15:08
COOPERATION AND INPUT FROM ALL 


[Captioner] 21:15:10
THE STAKEHOLDERS.


[Captioner] 21:15:11
>> Councilmember Salwan:   SO 


[Captioner] 21:15:13
THE CURRENTLY FACILITIES WE HAVE 


[Captioner] 21:15:16
LIKE THE ISLANDER OR THE HMC ARE 


[Captioner] 21:15:18
THEY BETTER THAN STATUS QUO OR 


[Captioner] 21:15:20
WHAT'S YOUR TAKE ON THAT?


[Captioner] 21:15:21
>> Sean Washington:   WELL, THE 


[Captioner] 21:15:24
HNC A HOMELESS SHELTER THAT HAS 


[Captioner] 21:15:26
A VERY SPECIFIC PURPOSE.


[Captioner] 21:15:27
SO, YOU KNOW, THERE OUR 


[Captioner] 21:15:29
PERSPECTIVE WE JUST STILL DO NOT 


[Captioner] 21:15:31
SEE A LOT OF SIGNIFICANT CALLS 


[Captioner] 21:15:34
FOR SERVICE AT THE HNC.


[Captioner] 21:15:36
I CAN TELL YOU JUST FROM BEING 


[Captioner] 21:15:38
HERE 26 YEARS AND HAVING WORKED 


[Captioner] 21:15:40
THE AREA OF THE MOTEL 6 DOWN 


[Captioner] 21:15:43
THERE, QUITE A BIT, THERE WERE 


[Captioner] 21:15:46
SOME SIGNIFICANT CRIME, CRITICAL 


[Captioner] 21:15:50
ACTIVITY THAT WAS AT OR 


[Captioner] 21:15:51
AROUND -- CRIMINAL ACTIVITY THAT 


[Captioner] 21:15:54
WAS OUT OR AROUND THAT MOTEL 


[Captioner] 21:15:55
OOPS LIKE I SAID FROM MY 


[Captioner] 21:15:56
PERSPECTIVE HAVING THE SUPPORT 


[Captioner] 21:15:57
SERVICES THAT ARE INCLUDED IN 


[Captioner] 21:16:00
THIS PROGRAM AS WELL AS ALL OF 


[Captioner] 21:16:01
THE CRIME MITIGATION EFFORTS 


[Captioner] 21:16:04
THAT WE WILL HAVE SOME INPUT ON, 


[Captioner] 21:16:06
AND THEN BASED ON ALL OF THE 


[Captioner] 21:16:07
INFORMATION THAT I'VE RECEIVED 


[Captioner] 21:16:09
THROUGHOUT THE STATE TALKING TO 


[Captioner] 21:16:10
OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT 


[Captioner] 21:16:12
PROFESSIONALS, IT'S A FEDERATE 


[Captioner] 21:16:14
GOOD INFERENCE, A RENAL 


[Captioner] 21:16:19
 REASONABLE 


[Captioner] 21:16:20
INFERENCE COULD BE MADE THAT IT 


[Captioner] 21:16:21
WILL BE AN IMPROVEMENT ON THE 


[Captioner] 21:16:22
AREA.


[Captioner] 21:16:24
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU, NEXT 


[Captioner] 21:16:26
I HAVE CLARIFYING QUESTIONS FROM 


[Captioner] 21:16:28
COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL.


[Captioner] 21:16:28
>> Councilmember Campbell:   


[Captioner] 21:16:28
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 21:16:29
I JUST HAVE A COUPLE OF 


[Captioner] 21:16:30
QUESTIONS.


[Captioner] 21:16:31
THANK YOU FOR ANSWERING SOME OF 


[Captioner] 21:16:33
MY EARLIER BUT AS THE DISCUSSION 


[Captioner] 21:16:35
HAPPENED I HAD A COUPLE 


[Captioner] 21:16:35
ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS THAT 


[Captioner] 21:16:37
WEREN'T THERE.


[Captioner] 21:16:39
I KNOW YOU SAID STEP UP IS GOING 


[Captioner] 21:16:41
TO BE THE SERVICE FROIRD.


[Captioner] 21:16:43
ARE THEY GOING TO BE PARTNERING 


[Captioner] 21:16:45
WITH LOCAL COMMUNITY BASED 


[Captioner] 21:16:46
ORGANIZATIONS TO HELP SUPPORT 


[Captioner] 21:16:49
THE WORK THAT THEY'RE DOING?


[Captioner] 21:16:49
>> Suzanne Shenfil:   YES, 


[Captioner] 21:16:50
ABSOLUTELY.


[Captioner] 21:16:52
IN FACT THAT WAS ONE OF THE 


[Captioner] 21:16:53
FIRST THINGS THAT THEY MENTIONED 


[Captioner] 21:16:55
WAS THAT THEY WANTED TO REACH 


[Captioner] 21:16:56
OUT AND MEET THE OTHER SERVICE 


[Captioner] 21:16:57
PROVIDERS AND WORK IN 


[Captioner] 21:16:58
PARTNERSHIP WITH THEM.


[Captioner] 21:17:01
AND THAT'S THE WAY THEY OPERATE 


[Captioner] 21:17:04
IN ALL OF THEIR 21 PROJECTS THAT 


[Captioner] 21:17:06
THEY'RE MANAGING.


[Captioner] 21:17:07
>> Councilmember Campbell:   


[Captioner] 21:17:08
OKAY THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 21:17:09
ADDITIONALLY WE TALKED ABOUT 


[Captioner] 21:17:10
CLEAN START.


[Captioner] 21:17:12
I HEARD -- I SAW IN ONE OF THE 


[Captioner] 21:17:14
SLIDES THAT THERE WAS GOING TO 


[Captioner] 21:17:16
BE SOME PORTABLE STRUCTURE IN 


[Captioner] 21:17:19
THE PARKING AREA FOR RESIDENT 


[Captioner] 21:17:21
VEHICLES, SERVICES AND 


[Captioner] 21:17:22
ACTIVITIES.


[Captioner] 21:17:24
DOES THAT INCLUDE LAUNDRY 


[Captioner] 21:17:24
FACILITIES?


[Captioner] 21:17:26
BECAUSE YOU SAID IT WAS GOING TO 


[Captioner] 21:17:28
BE VERY SMALL PLACES TO LIVE SO 


[Captioner] 21:17:30
WHERE IS THE LAUNDRY GOING TO 


[Captioner] 21:17:30
BE?


[Captioner] 21:17:33
>> SO AS A HOTEL THEY HAVE A 


[Captioner] 21:17:35
FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT LAUNDRY AREA.


[Captioner] 21:17:36
BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THEY WERE 


[Captioner] 21:17:37
WASHING SHEETS AND TOWELS.


[Captioner] 21:17:39
SO I THINK THERE WILL BE SOME 


[Captioner] 21:17:41
ASSESSMENT ABOUT WHETHER THAT 


[Captioner] 21:17:43
NEEDS TO BE EXPANDED MORE FULLY.


[Captioner] 21:17:46
BUT THERE ARE LAUNDRY FACILITIES 


[Captioner] 21:17:49
ONSITE, ALREADY.


[Captioner] 21:17:51
THERE IS NOT A LARGE COMMUNITY 


[Captioner] 21:17:53
ROOM THAT IF WE WERE 


[Captioner] 21:17:55
CONSTRUCTING A FACILITY FROM THE 


[Captioner] 21:17:57
GROUND UP WE'D BUILD A COMMUNITY 


[Captioner] 21:18:00
ROOM OR SPACE FOR THE RESIDENTS 


[Captioner] 21:18:02
TO GET TOGETHER AND HOLD EVENTS 


[Captioner] 21:18:04
AND SO FORTH.


[Captioner] 21:18:05
BECAUSE IT'S A HOTEL THEY DON'T 


[Captioner] 21:18:07
HAVE THAT KIND OF SPACE.


[Captioner] 21:18:09
SO THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT 


[Captioner] 21:18:11
LOCATING A PORTABLE THERE, A 


[Captioner] 21:18:14
CLASSROOM THAT COULD BE USED FOR 


[Captioner] 21:18:16
ALL KINDS OF THINGS, EVENTS, 


[Captioner] 21:18:20
COMMUNITY BUILDING, TRAINING, 


[Captioner] 21:18:22
EXERCISING ALL THAT KIND OF 


[Captioner] 21:18:23
ACTIVITY.


[Captioner] 21:18:24
>> Councilmember Campbell:   


[Captioner] 21:18:24
OKAY.


[Captioner] 21:18:25
OKAY.


[Captioner] 21:18:27
AND THEN MY LAST QUESTION WAS 


[Captioner] 21:18:28
WELL ACTUALLY IT WASN'T LIKE 


[Captioner] 21:18:30
ALMOST MY LAST QUESTION.


[Captioner] 21:18:32
OH, WHEN THE FUNDING.


[Captioner] 21:18:34
HAS THE COUNTY COMMITTED TO THE 


[Captioner] 21:18:35
MILLION DOLLARS?


[Captioner] 21:18:41
OR IS IT JUST A --


[Captioner] 21:18:42
>> Dan Schoenholz:   NO THEY 


[Captioner] 21:18:44
ACTUALLY COMMITTED, THE BOARD OF 


[Captioner] 21:18:44
SUPERVISORS COMMITTED THIS IS 


[Captioner] 21:18:47
PART OF LAST YEAR'S APPLICATION 


[Captioner] 21:18:49
SO WE WORKED WITH THEM TO CARRY 


[Captioner] 21:18:50
THAT FORWARD, YOU KNOW, IT'S 


[Captioner] 21:18:52
STILL AVAILABLE TO US.


[Captioner] 21:18:56
AGAIN IT'S CONDITIONAL UPON US 


[Captioner] 21:18:57
BEING SUCCESSFUL SECURING OUR 


[Captioner] 21:18:58
GRANT FROM THE STATE.


[Captioner] 21:18:59
>> Councilmember Campbell:   


[Captioner] 21:19:00
OKAY THANK YOU FOR THAT.


[Captioner] 21:19:01
AND THEN THE LAST QUESTION IS, 


[Captioner] 21:19:05
CAN YOU DEFINE FOR ME WHAT A 


[Captioner] 21:19:08
COORDINATED ENTRY SYSTEM IS?


[Captioner] 21:19:11
AND WHAT DOES THAT MEAN FOR THIS 


[Captioner] 21:19:14
PROJECT?


[Captioner] 21:19:16
>> THAT'S A REALLY GOOD 


[Captioner] 21:19:16
QUESTION.


[Captioner] 21:19:17
I DON'T KNOW IF I'M ABLE TO 


[Captioner] 21:19:18
EXPLAIN.


[Captioner] 21:19:21
IT IS VERY JARGON-Y.


[Captioner] 21:19:23
ESSENTIALLY THE COORDINATED 


[Captioner] 21:19:24
ENTRY IS A HUD MANDATE ON 


[Captioner] 21:19:26
COMMUNITIES TO ENSURE THAT THEY 


[Captioner] 21:19:28
ARE PROVIDING AN EQUITABLE 


[Captioner] 21:19:29
SYSTEM FOR EVERYONE EXPERIENCING 


[Captioner] 21:19:32
HOMELESSNESS OR AT RISK OF 


[Captioner] 21:19:33
HOMELESSNESS TO ACCESS SERVICES 


[Captioner] 21:19:35
IN A COORDINATED WAY AND ENSURE 


[Captioner] 21:19:37
THAT THEY'RE BEING MATCHED 


[Captioner] 21:19:38
APPROPRIATELY BASED ON THEIR 


[Captioner] 21:19:40
NEEDS AND THEIR ELIGIBILITY.


[Captioner] 21:19:42
THIS IS IN MANY WAYS 


[Captioner] 21:19:44
ASPIRATIONAL BECAUSE WE HAVE 


[Captioner] 21:19:45
MANY PEOPLE IN NEED BUT WE DO 


[Captioner] 21:19:47
NOT HAVE THE BALANCE OF SERVICES 


[Captioner] 21:19:47
AVAILABLE.


[Captioner] 21:19:52
SO WE RELY ON PRIORITIZATION AND 


[Captioner] 21:19:55
THE PRIORITIZATION IS BASED ON 


[Captioner] 21:19:57
LENGTH OF TIME HOMELESS AGE AND 


[Captioner] 21:19:58
MEDICAL CONDITIONS.


[Captioner] 21:20:00
SO THE MORE SEVERE YOUR 


[Captioner] 21:20:02
SITUATION IS THE MORE LIKELY YOU 


[Captioner] 21:20:04
ARE TO BE MATCHED TO THESE TYPES 


[Captioner] 21:20:05
OF SERVICES.


[Captioner] 21:20:06
AND HOUSING SOLUTIONS.


[Captioner] 21:20:08
AND SO THAT'S IN A NUTSHELL WHAT 


[Captioner] 21:20:10
COORDINATED ENTRY IS.


[Captioner] 21:20:12
AND THERE'S TWO PATHWAYS.


[Captioner] 21:20:13
YOU EITHER ARE MATCHED TO 


[Captioner] 21:20:15
HOUSING SOLUTIONS OR MORE 


[Captioner] 21:20:19
 


[Captioner] 21:20:20
TEMPORARILY SHELTER BEDS.


[Captioner] 21:20:22
THEY USE SIMPLE WAYS TO IDENTIFY 


[Captioner] 21:20:24
WHO IS MOST APPROPRIATE TO BE 


[Captioner] 21:20:27
MATCHED FOR AVAILABLE RESOURCES.


[Captioner] 21:20:27
>> Councilmember Campbell:   


[Captioner] 21:20:28
OKAY.


[Captioner] 21:20:30
>> I HOPE THAT WAS COMPREHENSIVE 


[Captioner] 21:20:31
ENOUGH.


[Captioner] 21:20:31
>> Councilmember Campbell:   I 


[Captioner] 21:20:33
KNOW THAT WAS COMPLICATED BUT I 


[Captioner] 21:20:34
THINK THAT WAS A REALLY GOOD 


[Captioner] 21:20:35
BROAD BRUSH TO HELP ME 


[Captioner] 21:20:36
UNDERSTAND BETTER.


[Captioner] 21:20:37
THANK YOU OR THE THAT.


[Captioner] 21:20:40
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 21:20:42
SO I DON'T SEE ANY MORE 


[Captioner] 21:20:44
CLARIFYING QUESTIONS.


[Captioner] 21:20:46
I KNOW THAT WE WILL HAVE A LOT 


[Captioner] 21:20:48
OF PUBLIC SPEAKERS ON THIS ITEM.


[Captioner] 21:20:50
I'LL RESERVE MINE UNTIL 


[Captioner] 21:20:50
AFTERWARDS.


[Captioner] 21:20:52
BUT I DO APPRECIATE THE 


[Captioner] 21:20:54
FOLLOW-UP AND I KNOW THAT I 


[Captioner] 21:20:56
APPRECIATE, IT SOUNDS LIKE 


[Captioner] 21:20:57
YOU'VE HAD SIGNIFICANT 


[Captioner] 21:21:00
CONVERSATIONS WITH OTHER 


[Captioner] 21:21:01
PROJECTS HOMEKEYS.


[Captioner] 21:21:03
I WILL JUST CHECK REAL QUICK.


[Captioner] 21:21:07
I KNOW THAT HERE REGIONALLY IN 


[Captioner] 21:21:09
OUR BAY AREA WERE WE ABLE TO 


[Captioner] 21:21:11
HAVE CONVERSATIONS OR VISIT SOME 


[Captioner] 21:21:13
OF THE OTHER PROJECT HOMEKEYS IN 


[Captioner] 21:21:16
OUR NINE COUNTY AREA, I GUESS 


[Captioner] 21:21:17
OUR COUNTY AREA.


[Captioner] 21:21:19
OKAY.


[Captioner] 21:21:21
NO I WAS JUST CURIOUS.


[Captioner] 21:21:24
I KNOW THERE WAS ONE THAT HAS 


[Captioner] 21:21:24
BEEN APPROVED.


[Captioner] 21:21:27
SOME OF THEM HAVE NOT BEEN 


[Captioner] 21:21:29
COMPLETED YET BECAUSE I KNOW NEW 


[Captioner] 21:21:33
 


[Captioner] 21:21:35
NEWARK HAS BEEN AWARDED ONE.


[Captioner] 21:21:37
I'M NOT SURE IF SOME HAVE 


[Captioner] 21:21:38
VISITED SOME OF THOSE LOCATIONS, 


[Captioner] 21:21:40
I KNOW I'VE HAD A CHANCE TO SEE 


[Captioner] 21:21:41
SOME OF THEM.


[Captioner] 21:21:42
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 21:21:44
AT THIS TIME I'D LIKE TO TURN IT 


[Captioner] 21:21:45
OVER FOR THE PUBLIC SPEAKERS AND 


[Captioner] 21:21:45
COMMENTS.


[Captioner] 21:21:47
I KNOW THAT WE HAVE A COUPLE OF 


[Captioner] 21:21:50
SPEAKER CARDS AND COMMENTS.


[Captioner] 21:21:53

[Captioner] 21:22:42

[Captioner] 21:23:01
TAKE THIS SOLUTION AND FOCUS ON 


[Captioner] 21:23:04

AND THIS IS ONE OF THOSE

PRECIOUS PROJECTS THAT ACTUALLY 


[Captioner] 21:24:02
STARTS ADDRESSING THE ROOT OF 


[Captioner] 21:24:04
THE PROBLEM WHICH IS THAT WE 


[Captioner] 21:24:05
DON'T HAVE ENOUGH HOUSING THAT 


[Captioner] 21:24:06
PEOPLE CAN AFFORD.


[Captioner] 21:24:08

TO HAVE THIS.


[Captioner] 21:24:12
HOUSING FIRST IS THE EVIDENCE

HOUSING FIRST RESULTS 


[Captioner] 21:24:21
UNSURPRISINGLY IN, YOU KNOW, 


[Captioner] 21:24:22
PEOPLE STAYING HOUSED MORE SO 


[Captioner] 21:24:25
THAN OTHER INTERVENTIONS, SO 


[Captioner] 21:24:25

AS A LIFELONG RESIDENT OF

[Captioner] 21:24:38
IS A VERY GOOD START TO 


[Captioner] 21:24:41
PERMANENTLY SOLVING THE ISSUE WE 


[Captioner] 21:24:43
FACE INVOLVED THE UNHOUSED.


[Captioner] 21:24:45
FREMONT WAS ABLE TO RECOGNIZE 


[Captioner] 21:24:48
866 UNHOUSED PEOPLE AND IF 


[Captioner] 21:24:49
PROJECT HOMEKEY IS APPROVED WE 


[Captioner] 21:24:51
CAN GIVE THAT TO 156 OF THEM.


[Captioner] 21:24:53
AND I THINK IT'S A VERY GOOD 


[Captioner] 21:24:55
START TO PERMANENTLY HOUSING ALL 


[Captioner] 21:24:57

[Captioner] 21:25:01

[Captioner] 21:29:54
BUT I LIKE TO POINT A FEW 


[Captioner] 21:29:55
THINGS.


[Captioner] 21:29:58
AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS NOT EQUAL 


[Captioner] 21:29:59
TO HOMEKEY.


[Captioner] 21:30:01
WE NEED TO MAKE THIS CLEAR.


[Captioner] 21:30:03
AS THIS GENTLEMAN POINTED OUT, 


[Captioner] 21:30:07
HOMEKEY DOES NOT ALLOW US TO 


[Captioner] 21:30:08
SCREENING OUT THE DANGEROUS 


[Captioner] 21:30:10
PEOPLE.


[Captioner] 21:30:12
FROM LIVING IN THE HOMEKEY 


[Captioner] 21:30:13

[Captioner] 21:30:16
THIS IS GOING TO POSING A LOT OF 


[Captioner] 21:30:17

AND WHAT'S OUR GOAL?


[Captioner] 21:30:23
IT'S TO REDUCE HOMELESSNESS, AS 


[Captioner] 21:30:25
THAT GENTLEMAN POINTED OUT, 


[Captioner] 21:30:26
HOWEVER, HOMEKEY IS NOT GOING TO 


[Captioner] 21:30:28
ACHIEVE THAT BECAUSE HOMEKEY IS 


[Captioner] 21:30:31
BASED ON HOUSING FIRST.


[Captioner] 21:30:33
SAN FRANCISCO IMPLEMENTED 


[Captioner] 21:30:35
HOUSING FIRST SINCE 2004.


[Captioner] 21:30:36
GUESS WHAT?


[Captioner] 21:30:39
THEY HAVE THE WORST PROBLEM.


[Captioner] 21:30:41
THEREFORE I STRONGLY OPPOSE

OPENED THE HOMEKEY SITE IN

DISABLED, THAT JUST NEEDS A REAL 


[Captioner] 21:35:06
PLACE TO LIVE TO CALL HOME.


[Captioner] 21:35:09
NOT AN INSTITUTION THAT HAS 


[Captioner] 21:35:11
GATES AND WALLS IN ONE WAY IN 


[Captioner] 21:35:12
AND ONE WAY OUT.

[Captioner] 21:35:44
>> AS A RESIDENT OF METRO 


[Captioner] 21:35:46
CROSSING I HIGHLY OPPOSE THE 


[Captioner] 21:35:47
HOMEKEY UNLESS THERE IS ENOUGH 


[Captioner] 21:35:48
POLICE RESOURCES.


[Captioner] 21:35:52
BECAUSE WE ALREADY HAVE STATION 


[Captioner] 21:35:53
IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING, WE HAVE 


[Captioner] 21:35:56
SEEN LIKE 20 COPS CAR, 15 COPS 


[Captioner] 21:35:58
CAR OCCASIONALLY HERE JUST TO 


[Captioner] 21:36:02
DEAL WITH THE CRIME SUSPECT OVER 


[Captioner] 21:36:02
THERE.


[Captioner] 21:36:06
IF WE HAVE LIKE LOW INCOME AND 


[Captioner] 21:36:07
ESPECIALLY SUBSTANCE ABUSE 


[Captioner] 21:36:09
MENTALLY DISABLED PEOPLE HOW DO 


[Captioner] 21:36:11
WE GUARANTEE THE SAFETY OF THE 


[Captioner] 21:36:12
COMMUNITY?


[Captioner] 21:36:15
I PRIORITIZE THE SAFETY OF METRO 


[Captioner] 21:36:17
CROSSING OVER ANY INCLUSIVENESS, 


[Captioner] 21:36:18
OKAY.


[Captioner] 21:36:20
AND THIS IS ALL I HAVE TO SAY.


[Captioner] 21:36:22
I SAY NO TO HOMEKEY.


[Captioner] 21:36:23
NOT BASED ON FACTS.


[Captioner] 21:36:26
ON YOUR SO-CALLED EVIDENCE 


[Captioner] 21:36:26
STUDIES.


[Captioner] 21:36:28
IT'S BASED ON MY EXPERIENCE IN 


[Captioner] 21:36:29

AS A LONG TIME FREMONT RESIDENT, 


[Captioner] 21:36:44
AND A MEMBER OF BETTER FREMONT, 


[Captioner] 21:36:46
I STRONGLY OPPOSE THIS HOMEKEY 


[Captioner] 21:36:47
PROJECT.


[Captioner] 21:36:50
I BELIEVE THE HOMELESS ISSUE IS 


[Captioner] 21:36:51
BEYOND JUST HOUSING.


[Captioner] 21:36:53
MORE IMPORTANTLY THE HOMELESS 


[Captioner] 21:36:55
PEOPLE NEED HELP AND SUPPORT ON 


[Captioner] 21:36:56
THEIR MENTAL OR DRUG ISSUES 


[Captioner] 21:36:58
BEFORE THEY CAN GET BACK ON 


[Captioner] 21:36:59
THEIR FEET.


[Captioner] 21:37:01
LEAVING THEM IN SUCH A FACILITY 


[Captioner] 21:37:02
WITHOUT MUCH REGULATION AND 


[Captioner] 21:37:04
NEEDED SUPPORT WILL SIMPLY MAKE 


[Captioner] 21:37:06
THIS PROJECT FASTER.


[Captioner] 21:37:08
AS YOU SEE FROM SIMILAR HOMEKEY 


[Captioner] 21:37:10
PROJECT IN OUR NEARBY CITIES 


[Captioner] 21:37:13
SUCH AS A MILPITAS, SAN JOSE AND 


[Captioner] 21:37:14
SAN FRANCISCO, IT HAS BEEN 


[Captioner] 21:37:16
PROVED THAT THIS IS A FAILURE 


[Captioner] 21:37:17
PROGRAM.


[Captioner] 21:37:21
DATA SHOWS CRIME RATE IN THIS 


[Captioner] 21:37:24
NEARBY CITY WITH HOMEKEY HAS 


[Captioner] 21:37:24
BEEN INCREASED.


[Captioner] 21:37:26
WE DON'T WANT THIS HAPPENING IN 


[Captioner] 21:37:27
FREMONT.


[Captioner] 21:37:29
WE URGE FREMONT CITY COUNCIL 


[Captioner] 21:37:31

COUNCIL MEMBER.


[Captioner] 21:37:48
BEFORE WE DEFINE HOMEKEY, WE 


[Captioner] 21:37:51
DON'T HAVE TO FOLLOW STAND UP.


[Captioner] 21:37:53
POLICE PRIORITIZE THE DISABLED 


[Captioner] 21:37:56
VETERANS, AND SENIORS IN THAT, 


[Captioner] 21:37:59
WITH 1065 HOMELESS IN THE CENSUS 


[Captioner] 21:38:02
WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO AWARD THE 


[Captioner] 21:38:05
156 UNITS TO THOSE WHO DON'T 


[Captioner] 21:38:07
CAUSE A THREAT TO OTHER 


[Captioner] 21:38:10
RESIDENTS AND NEIGHBORHOODS.


[Captioner] 21:38:13
IDEOLOGY ALL SOUND VERY NICE BUT 


[Captioner] 21:38:16
THEY MUST NOT BE PART OF OUR 


[Captioner] 21:38:18
FREMONT HOMEKEY MODEL.


[Captioner] 21:38:21
REREQUISITE FOR BEING IN OUR 


[Captioner] 21:38:23

AGAINST HOMEKEY PROJECT 


[Captioner] 21:42:09
ESPECIALLY THE MOTEL 6.


[Captioner] 21:42:13
I JUST AWARE THAT LANDINGS ARE 


[Captioner] 21:42:15
LOCATED, THEY ARE IN THE 


[Captioner] 21:42:17
OUTSKIRTS OF THE AREA.


[Captioner] 21:42:19
THE SIMILAR COMMUNITY IN BAY 


[Captioner] 21:42:20
AREA IS TRACY.


[Captioner] 21:42:22
IT'S NOT FREMONT.


[Captioner] 21:42:25
HERE IS THE FUTURE HIGH TECH HUB 


[Captioner] 21:42:28
AND ALL THE R AND D RESEARCHERS 


[Captioner] 21:42:30
NEED A QUIETER AND PEACEFUL 


[Captioner] 21:42:33
ENVIRONMENT OKAY TO WORK AND GET 


[Captioner] 21:42:34
RECOVERED.


[Captioner] 21:42:38
AND IT'S NOT FOR SOME 


[Captioner] 21:42:39
CONTROVERSIAL PROJECTS LIKE THE 


[Captioner] 21:42:41
MOTEL 6 ARE TO BE LOCATED HERE.

[Captioner] 21:42:53
TO THE FREMONT RESIDENTS AND TO 


[Captioner] 21:42:54
THE HOMELESS.


[Captioner] 21:42:56
THEY HAVE A PLACE TO RECOVER AND 


[Captioner] 21:42:57
GET TRAINING TO COME BACK TO THE 


[Captioner] 21:42:58
COMMUNITY.


[Captioner] 21:43:00
THIS IS A WINGDING STRATEGY WE 


[Captioner] 21:43:02
SHOULD TAKE, THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 21:43:07
>> The Clerk:   THE NEXT SPEAKER 


[Captioner] 21:43:07

[Captioner] 21:43:25
YES.


[Captioner] 21:43:28
HOMEKEY IS I SUPPORT THE HOMEKEY 


[Captioner] 21:43:29
BUT IT SHOULD BE NOTED THIS IS 


[Captioner] 21:43:32
JUST ONE MILE FROM MISSION PEAK.


[Captioner] 21:43:34
AND A LOT OF THE SAME PEOPLE 


[Captioner] 21:43:36
THAT WERE SO HAPPY TO -- A LOT 


[Captioner] 21:43:38
OF THE SAME POLITICIANS THAT 


[Captioner] 21:43:40
WERE SO HAPPY TO DO EVERYTHING 


[Captioner] 21:43:42
POSSIBLE AND MORE TO MEET THE 


[Captioner] 21:43:44
WISHES AND DESIRES OF THE 


[Captioner] 21:43:47
MISSION PEAK COMMUNITY ARE NOW 


[Captioner] 21:43:49
TAKING WITH THE OTHER HAND.


[Captioner] 21:43:50
THEY GIVE WITH ONE HAND TAKE 


[Captioner] 21:43:51
WITH THE OTHER HAND.


[Captioner] 21:43:52
SO FOR EXAMPLE THE HOMELESS 


[Captioner] 21:43:54
NAVIGATION CENTER OF WHICH 


[Captioner] 21:43:56
YOU'RE SO PROUD, THREE YEARS AGO 


[Captioner] 21:43:57
IT STARTED AND THREE YEARS AGO 


[Captioner] 21:43:59
YOU SAID IT WOULD BE AN 


[Captioner] 21:44:01
OPERATION FOR THREE OFIVE YEARS.


[Captioner] 21:44:02
SO WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN HEARING 


[Captioner] 21:44:04
TODAY THAT IT ONLY HAS A YEAR OR 


[Captioner] 21:44:05
TWO LEFT.


[Captioner] 21:44:07
OF COURSE THAT IS NOT TRUE.


[Captioner] 21:44:08
THERE IS A LOT OF, YOU KNOW, 


[Captioner] 21:44:10
FANCIFUL PROMISES BEING MADE 


[Captioner] 21:44:12
THAT ARE PROBABLY NEVER GOING TO 


[Captioner] 21:44:14
BE FULFILLED.


[Captioner] 21:44:16
ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS CENTERVILLE.


[Captioner] 21:44:18
IF YOU ARE REALLY LOOKING TO 


[Captioner] 21:44:20
REDUCE CRIME TO ELIMINATE CRIME, 


[Captioner] 21:44:23
CENTERVILLE IS YOUR BEST 


[Captioner] 21:44:25
SOLUTION.


[Captioner] 21:44:29
BECAUSE IN CENTERVILLE YOU --


[Captioner] 21:44:30
>> The Clerk:   NEXT SPEAKER IS

HOMELESSNESS WILL GO WORSE AND 


[Captioner] 21:45:00
WORSE.


[Captioner] 21:45:02
HOMEKEY IS A GOOD START.


[Captioner] 21:45:06
I'M ALSO WORRIED MEETING THE 


[Captioner] 21:45:08
HOUSING REQUIREMENT WITHOUT THIS 


[Captioner] 21:45:08
PROJECT.


[Captioner] 21:45:10
FREMONT WOULD GET SUED NOT 


[Captioner] 21:45:13
MEETING IT AND WE WOULD WASTE 


[Captioner] 21:45:16
TAXPAYER MONEY LOSING.


[Captioner] 21:45:18
I SEE SOME TAXPAYERS IN 


[Captioner] 21:45:19
CALIFORNIA ARE ALREADY GETTING 


[Captioner] 21:45:20
SUED FOR THIS.


[Captioner] 21:45:23
I THINK HUNTINGTON BEACH ARE 


[Captioner] 21:45:24
BEING SUED BY THE STATE OF 


[Captioner] 21:45:27
CALIFORNIA SO IF WE GET SUED 


[Captioner] 21:45:29
THEN WE WOULD NEED TO WASTE 


[Captioner] 21:45:30
TAXPAYER MONEY FOR THIS AND 


[Captioner] 21:45:32
EVERYONE LOSES.

RESPECTFULLY I DON'T THINK THIS 


[Captioner] 21:45:50
IS WELL THOUGHT OUT.


[Captioner] 21:45:52
I HAVE TO ASK HOW MANY 


[Captioner] 21:45:54
SUPPORTERS ACTUALLY LIVE IN THE 


[Captioner] 21:45:56
FIVE BLOCK RADIUS NEAR THE SITE

[Captioner] 21:46:01
HERE ARE THREE OTHER POINTS TO 


[Captioner] 21:46:01

[Captioner] 21:46:36
INCREMENT AND DRUG DEALS AROUND

[Captioner] 21:47:02
SUPPORT PROJECT HOMEKEY.


[Captioner] 21:47:04
I WAS ALARMED BY SOME OF THE 


[Captioner] 21:47:06
GUIDELINES STATED HERE SUCH AS 


[Captioner] 21:47:08
TENANT SCREENING AND SELECTION 


[Captioner] 21:47:10
PROCESS THAT PROMOTE ACCEPTING 


[Captioner] 21:47:11
APPLICANTS REGARDLESS OF THE 


[Captioner] 21:47:14
SOBRIETY OR USE OF SUBSTANCES, 


[Captioner] 21:47:15
COMPLETION OF TREATMENT OR 


[Captioner] 21:47:16
PARTICIPATION SERVICES.


[Captioner] 21:47:20
AND THEN THERE'S MOTIONS ABOUT 


[Captioner] 21:47:22
BEING VOLUNTARY AND USE OF 


[Captioner] 21:47:26
DRUGS, ALCOHOL AND ITSELF WITH 


[Captioner] 21:47:28
OTHER VIOLATIONS IS NOT A REASON 


[Captioner] 21:47:29
FOR EVICTION.


[Captioner] 21:47:33
THERE IS TOO MANY RED FLAGS FOR 


[Captioner] 21:47:33
THIS PROGRAM.


[Captioner] 21:47:35
I READ IN ANOTHER PUBLICATION 


[Captioner] 21:47:38
THAT YOU GUYS CAN ALSO PASS ON 


[Captioner] 21:47:40
NARCAN AS WELL IN CASE OF 


[Captioner] 21:47:40
OVERDOSE.


[Captioner] 21:47:43
THIS DOES NOT WORK, I DO NOT 


[Captioner] 21:47:44
SUPPORT PROJECT HOMEKEY IN 


[Captioner] 21:47:45
FREMONT.


[Captioner] 21:47:46
SECOND POINT I WANT TO MAKE IS 


[Captioner] 21:47:48
JUST REFERENCING AN ARTICLE IN 


[Captioner] 21:47:52
CAL MATTERS, IT SAYS IT'S TITLED --


[Captioner] 21:47:55

[Captioner] 21:48:17
PEOPLE WHO WOULD END UP OR ARE 


[Captioner] 21:48:18

STABLE HOUSING IS THE ONLY LONG 


[Captioner] 21:48:23

[Captioner] 21:48:25
HOMELESSNESS.


[Captioner] 21:48:27

THEY CANNOT HAVE IT BOTH WAYS.


[Captioner] 21:48:36
THEY SAY NOT IN MY BACKYARD BUT 


[Captioner] 21:48:37

THINK IT'S OKAY TO SPEND OUR 


[Captioner] 21:49:16
HARD EARNED TAX DOLLARS ON A 


[Captioner] 21:49:17
PROJECT THAT WOULD INCREASE 


[Captioner] 21:49:19

[Captioner] 21:50:52
I THINK ISSUE HERE HAS ALWAYS 


[Captioner] 21:50:55
BEEN FEAR AND THE CAUSE OF 


[Captioner] 21:50:57
THE -- AND CAUSED IS 


[Captioner] 21:50:58
MISINFORMATION AND LACK OF

>> HELLO, LOOK, I USED TO BE 


[Captioner] 21:52:01
HOMELESS IN FREMONT FOR EIGHT 


[Captioner] 21:52:02
YEARS.


[Captioner] 21:52:05
AND THEN ABODE PICKED ME UP AND 


[Captioner] 21:52:07
TOOK ME TO OAKLAND BUT NOW I'M 


[Captioner] 21:52:09
IN TRANSITIONAL HOUSING, THERE 


[Captioner] 21:52:10
IS NOT ENOUGH HOUSING SO I WANT 


[Captioner] 21:52:12
TO COME BACK TO FREMONT.


[Captioner] 21:52:14
BUT NOT EVERYBODY IS HOW THESE 


[Captioner] 21:52:15
BAD PEOPLE THINK.


[Captioner] 21:52:17
I'M NOT BAD, I DON'T DO DRUGS, 


[Captioner] 21:52:19
WHEN COVID HIT I LOST MY 


[Captioner] 21:52:19
BUSINESS.


[Captioner] 21:52:22
THERE'S OTHER THINGS BESIDES US 


[Captioner] 21:52:23
DOING DRUGS.


[Captioner] 21:52:25

OKAY WE'LL GO TO STEPHANIE SITO.


[Captioner] 21:52:54
>> HI.


[Captioner] 21:52:57
SO BESIDES ALL THIS PROS AND 


[Captioner] 21:52:59
CONS I JUST WANT TO LET YOU KNOW 


[Captioner] 21:53:00
IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT SITUATION 


[Captioner] 21:53:02
THAT WE ARE DEALING WITH 


[Captioner] 21:53:04
ESPECIALLY WITH HOMELESSNESS.


[Captioner] 21:53:06
BECAUSE THE FOUNDATION OF THE 


[Captioner] 21:53:10
PROBLEM IS NOT THEY'RE UNHOUSED, 


[Captioner] 21:53:11
IT'S MAJORITY OF THE SITUATION 


[Captioner] 21:53:13
THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH IS A 


[Captioner] 21:53:14
HARD PROBLEM.


[Captioner] 21:53:16
WE NEED A VILLAGE TO HELP 


[Captioner] 21:53:21
HOMELESS PERSON TO FIND SUITABLE 


[Captioner] 21:53:23
WE BUILD A RELATIONSHIP FOUND A 


[Captioner] 21:53:25
SUITABLE HOME FOR THEM.


[Captioner] 21:53:27
AND I JUST HAPPEN TO COME ACROSS 


[Captioner] 21:53:30
A VIDEO YESTERDAY ON YOUTUBE 


[Captioner] 21:53:34
FROM A PREVIOUS PRESIDENT, CITY 


[Captioner] 21:53:35
SUPERVISOR OF SAN FRANCISCO AND 


[Captioner] 21:53:38
HER NAME IS ANGELA ALIOTO.


[Captioner] 21:53:40
AND I THINK SHE HAD MENTIONED IN 


[Captioner] 21:53:42
THE VIDEO THAT ONE CRITERIA WHEN 


[Captioner] 21:53:44
SHE WAS SELECTING HOMELESS IS 


[Captioner] 21:53:47
NOT TARGETING ANY CHRONIC 


[Captioner] 21:53:49
HOMELESS PERSON RATHER THAN SHE 


[Captioner] 21:53:51
WILL HELP THAT SOMEONE IS 


[Captioner] 21:53:53
ENCOUNTERING SOME FINANCIAL 


[Captioner] 21:53:55
DIFFICULTY, THEY'RE ABOUT TO BE 


[Captioner] 21:53:57
HOMELESS AND SHE WILL TARGET 


[Captioner] 21:53:57
THOSE --


[Captioner] 21:53:58
>> The Clerk:   THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 21:54:14



[Captioner] 21:54:18
RADOSLA VFERTION KAZINSKY.


[Captioner] 21:54:20
I APOLOGIZE FOR BUTCHERING THAT.


[Captioner] 21:54:22
>> GOOD EVENING, MY MESSAGE IS 


[Captioner] 21:54:23
GOING TO BE VERY SHORT AND TO 


[Captioner] 21:54:25
THE POINT.


[Captioner] 21:54:28
CALIFORNIA HAS SPENT BILLIONS OF 


[Captioner] 21:54:30
DOLLARS ON HOMELESSNESS YET THE 


[Captioner] 21:54:31
PROBLEM HAS NOT BEEN SOLVED.


[Captioner] 21:54:33
HOMELESSNESS HAS INCREASED FROM 


[Captioner] 21:54:34
YEAR TO YEAR.


[Captioner] 21:54:36
AND I URGE EVERY SINGLE ONE OF 


[Captioner] 21:54:38
YOU TO GO TO SAN FRANCISCO AND 


[Captioner] 21:54:40
SEE HOW THE PROGRAMS ARE WORKING 


[Captioner] 21:54:40
THERE.


[Captioner] 21:54:42
WALK THE STREETS.


[Captioner] 21:54:44
WALK SOME OF THE HOTELS THAT 


[Captioner] 21:54:46
HAVE BEEN CONVERTED TO SOME OF 


[Captioner] 21:54:48
THESE PROJECTS AND SEE IT FOR 


[Captioner] 21:54:49
YOUR CELL WHETHER THEY'RE 


[Captioner] 21:54:50
SUCCESSFUL OR NOT.


[Captioner] 21:54:52
I CAN TELL YOU THEY ARE NOT 


[Captioner] 21:54:53
SUCCESSFUL.


[Captioner] 21:54:55
AND IT'S JUST GOING TO CAUSE A 


[Captioner] 21:54:56
LOT OF ISSUES FOR US.


[Captioner] 21:54:58
AND ANYBODY HERE WHO WANTS TO 


[Captioner] 21:55:00
HELP A HOMELESS PERSON TAKE THEM 


[Captioner] 21:55:01
TO YOUR HOME.


[Captioner] 21:55:03
GIVE THEM THE RESOURCES THAT YOU 


[Captioner] 21:55:04
HAVE AVAILABLE.


[Captioner] 21:55:06
SO THEY CAN BECOME SUCCESSFUL.


[Captioner] 21:55:08
BUT THE QUESTION IS, THE PEOPLE 


[Captioner] 21:55:09
THAT ARE SUPPORTING THIS PROJECT 


[Captioner] 21:55:10
WILL NOT DO THAT.


[Captioner] 21:55:12
AND MY QUESTION IS WHY?


[Captioner] 21:55:12
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 21:55:15
[APPLAUSE]


[Captioner] 21:55:17
>> The Clerk:   THIS IS THE LAST 


[Captioner] 21:55:20
CALL FOR BOB BRUNTON.


[Captioner] 21:55:22

[Captioner] 21:55:27

[Captioner] 21:55:27

[Captioner] 21:55:28

[Captioner] 21:55:29

[Captioner] 21:55:30
COMMENT.


[Captioner] 21:55:31
AND THEN I'LL TURN IT BACK TO 


[Captioner] 21:55:32
OUR COUNCIL FOR FURTHER 


[Captioner] 21:55:38
DISCUSSION.


[Captioner] 21:55:43
COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL.


[Captioner] 21:55:44
>> Councilmember Campbell:   


[Captioner] 21:55:47
OKAY, WELL THANK YOU GUYS FOR 


[Captioner] 21:55:48
THIS CONVERSATION AND FOR 


[Captioner] 21:55:52
BRINGING THIS TO COUNCIL TO 


[Captioner] 21:55:53
DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT WE'RE 


[Captioner] 21:55:54
GOING TO APPROVE THIS 


[Captioner] 21:55:55
APPLICATION.


[Captioner] 21:55:58
AS MANY OF YOU MAY ALREADY KNOW 


[Captioner] 21:56:01
I KNOW I'VE SPOKEN ABOUT THIS A 


[Captioner] 21:56:01
NUMBER OF TIMES.


[Captioner] 21:56:04
I HAVE A SON WHO WAS UNSHELTERED 


[Captioner] 21:56:06
IN WASHINGTON, D.C, FOR A VERY, 


[Captioner] 21:56:09
VERY LONG TIME.


[Captioner] 21:56:11
AROUND IT IS -- IT IS PAINFUL TO 


[Captioner] 21:56:13
WATCH YOUR FAMILY MEMBERS, 


[Captioner] 21:56:17
ESPECIALLY YOUR SON, BE WITHOUT 


[Captioner] 21:56:19
SHELTER, LIVING IN DAY-TO-DAY 


[Captioner] 21:56:21
SHELTERS THAT GO VISIT HIM AND 


[Captioner] 21:56:24
HE HAD TO QUICKLY GET IN LINE TO 


[Captioner] 21:56:29
SIGN UP TO BE INTO ONE OF THESE 


[Captioner] 21:56:30
OVERNIGHT SHELTERS.


[Captioner] 21:56:32
DESPERATE FOR A PLACE TO LIVE.


[Captioner] 21:56:35
CALLING ME ON THE PHONE CRYING.


[Captioner] 21:56:37
I EVEN AT THE TIME, WHEN WE 


[Captioner] 21:56:39
DIDN'T HAVE CELL PHONES, IT'S 


[Captioner] 21:56:43
BEEN A WHILE, I HAD AN 800 NUMB 


[Captioner] 21:56:44
SO I COULD JUST BE IN TOUCH WITH 


[Captioner] 21:56:45
MY SON.


[Captioner] 21:56:47
BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE HE 


[Captioner] 21:56:49
WAS OR WHAT HE WAS DOING.


[Captioner] 21:56:51
BUT I HAD TO HAVE A LIFE LINE.


[Captioner] 21:56:54
SO WE GOT A 1-800-NUMBER, HE 


[Captioner] 21:56:56
COULD CALL ME FROM WHEREVER HE 


[Captioner] 21:56:58
WAS SO WE COULD TALK.


[Captioner] 21:56:59
AND SHARE WITH HIM.


[Captioner] 21:57:01
AND I ALWAYS ENCOURAGED HIM THAT 


[Captioner] 21:57:02
EVENTUALLY THIS WOULD -- HE 


[Captioner] 21:57:04
COULD DO SOMETHING GOOD WITH THE 


[Captioner] 21:57:06
SITUATION THAT HE HAD FOUND 


[Captioner] 21:57:08
HIMSELF IN.


[Captioner] 21:57:10
FORTUNATELY, ABOUT SIX OR SEVEN 


[Captioner] 21:57:11
YEARS AGO, HE WAS ABLE TO GET 


[Captioner] 21:57:15
INTO ONE OF THESE HOMEKEY STYLE 


[Captioner] 21:57:17
PLACES TO LIVE.


[Captioner] 21:57:18
AND HE'S BEEN LIVING THERE AND 


[Captioner] 21:57:22
I'VE HAD -- I'VE BEEN ABLE TO BE 


[Captioner] 21:57:23
IN CONSTANT CONTACT WITH HIM.


[Captioner] 21:57:25
MY FAMILY HAVE BEEN BE ABLE TO 


[Captioner] 21:57:27
BE IN CONSTANT CONTACT WITH HIM 


[Captioner] 21:57:29
BECAUSE THEY WERE WORRIED ABOUT 


[Captioner] 21:57:29
HIM ALSO.


[Captioner] 21:57:32
YOU CAN IMAGINE I'M 3,000 MILES 


[Captioner] 21:57:34
AWAY FROM MY FIRST BORN CHILD.


[Captioner] 21:57:36
SO IT IS VERY, VERY DIFFICULT TO 


[Captioner] 21:57:37
WATCH.


[Captioner] 21:57:41
IT'S VERY, VERY PAINFUL TO SEE 


[Captioner] 21:57:43
THE ONES THAT YOU LOVE LIVING ON 


[Captioner] 21:57:44
THE STREET.


[Captioner] 21:57:46
FOR WHATEVER THE REASON IS.


[Captioner] 21:57:48
AND THERE WAS NO -- THERE IS NO 


[Captioner] 21:57:49
JUDGMENT FOR ME.


[Captioner] 21:57:51
WHEN IT COMES TO WHAT HAPPENS TO 


[Captioner] 21:57:53
PEOPLE WHO ARE LIVING ON THE 


[Captioner] 21:57:55
STREET BECAUSE WE JUST DON'T 


[Captioner] 21:57:57
KNOW WHAT THEIR SITUATIONS ARE 


[Captioner] 21:57:59
OR WERE AND HOW THEY MANAGED TO 


[Captioner] 21:58:02
GET THERE AND WHAT LIVES WE CAN 


[Captioner] 21:58:04
SAVE BY JUST BEING KIND AND 


[Captioner] 21:58:07
CONSIDERATE TO PEOPLE WHO DON'T 


[Captioner] 21:58:08
HAVE WHAT WE HAVE.


[Captioner] 21:58:10
I'VE WITNESSED EVEN HERE IN 


[Captioner] 21:58:11
FREMONT.


[Captioner] 21:58:13
PREGNANT WOMEN LIVING ON THE 


[Captioner] 21:58:15
STREET THAT I'VE GIVEN MONEY TO 


[Captioner] 21:58:17
AND FOOD TO BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T 


[Captioner] 21:58:18
HAVE A PLACE TO LIVE FOR 


[Captioner] 21:58:19
WHATEVER REASON.


[Captioner] 21:58:21
IT'S NO JUDGMENT CALL.


[Captioner] 21:58:24
I WORKED WITH THE HOMELESS WHEN 


[Captioner] 21:58:28
WE DID -- WENT OVER LEAF PROGRAM 


[Captioner] 21:58:29
FOR MANY, MANY YEARS I MANAGED 


[Captioner] 21:58:31
THAT PROGRAM FOR MY CHURCH.


[Captioner] 21:58:33
WE BROUGHT FAMILIES THAT WERE 


[Captioner] 21:58:35
LIVING ON THE STREET INTO THE 


[Captioner] 21:58:36
CHURCH TO HAVE SHELTER FOR 


[Captioner] 21:58:37
MONTHS AT A TIME.


[Captioner] 21:58:41
SO THIS IS NOT A PROBLEM THAT WE 


[Captioner] 21:58:44
COULD JUST SWEEP UNDER THE RUG 


[Captioner] 21:58:46
AND PRETEND THAT IT DOESN'T 


[Captioner] 21:58:49
EXIST AND IT'S NOT RIGHT IN OUR 


[Captioner] 21:58:51
MIDST.


[Captioner] 21:58:53
AND AS AN ELECTED OFFICIAL WE 


[Captioner] 21:58:55
ARE ELECTED TO HELP ALL PEOPLE, 


[Captioner] 21:58:57
NOT JUST THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE 


[Captioner] 21:58:58
HOUSES.


[Captioner] 21:58:59
BUT WE ARE HERE TO SUPPORT 


[Captioner] 21:59:01
EVERYONE.


[Captioner] 21:59:03
WHETHER -- WE ARE HERE FOR THE 


[Captioner] 21:59:04
CITIZENS OF FREMONT.


[Captioner] 21:59:06
AND THAT INCLUDES THE ONES THAT 


[Captioner] 21:59:08
HAVE HOUSING, THE ONES THAT ARE 


[Captioner] 21:59:10
WEALTHIER, THE ONES THAT ARE LOW 


[Captioner] 21:59:12
INCOME, THE ONES THAT HAVE DOGS 


[Captioner] 21:59:14
AND WHO DON'T HAVE DOGS OR 


[Captioner] 21:59:14
WHATEVER.


[Captioner] 21:59:18
BUT THE POINT IS, THAT WE 


[Captioner] 21:59:20
CANNOT, AS ELECTED OFFICIALS, 


[Captioner] 21:59:23
LOOK AT ANY SITUATION WITHOUT 


[Captioner] 21:59:25
ALL OF THE FACTS AND THE 


[Captioner] 21:59:26
INFORMATION THAT HAS BEEN 


[Captioner] 21:59:27
PROVIDED FOR US.


[Captioner] 21:59:29
AND I THINK THE STAFF DID AN 


[Captioner] 21:59:30
EXCELLENT JOB PROVIDING THAT 


[Captioner] 21:59:32
INFORMATION TO US.


[Captioner] 21:59:34
I DO HAVE A QUICK COUPLE OF 


[Captioner] 21:59:34
QUESTIONS.


[Captioner] 21:59:37
I GUESS YOU WERE GOING TO SAY IS 


[Captioner] 21:59:38
THERE A QUESTION HERE?


[Captioner] 21:59:41
THERE IS ONE.


[Captioner] 21:59:46
I WANTED TO HEAR FROM YOU AGAIN 


[Captioner] 21:59:46
CHIEF.


[Captioner] 21:59:50
YOU SENT ME A SHEET HERE THAT 


[Captioner] 21:59:52
TALKED ABOUT THE CRIME RATE 


[Captioner] 21:59:53
BECAUSE THAT IS ONE OF THE 


[Captioner] 21:59:54
THINGS THAT WE HAVE BEEN HEARING 


[Captioner] 21:59:56
THAT THERE WAS A LOT OF.


[Captioner] 21:59:58
YOU GAVE ME SOME DATA AND WHAT 


[Captioner] 22:00:01
I'M SEEING IS THE HOUSING 


[Captioner] 22:00:04
NAVIGATION CENTER FOR EXAMPLE, 


[Captioner] 22:00:06
COMPARED TO THE ISLANDER AND 


[Captioner] 22:00:10
MAIN STREET VILLAGE AND LAGUNA 


[Captioner] 22:00:13
COMMONS AND I WILL ALSO PREFACE 


[Captioner] 22:00:15
THIS, THERE IS AFFORDABLE 


[Captioner] 22:00:17
HOUSING IN JUST ABOUT EVERY UNIT 


[Captioner] 22:00:18
AROUND THE CITY.


[Captioner] 22:00:20
MARKET RATE HOUSING THEY STILL 


[Captioner] 22:00:22
HAVE AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS IN 


[Captioner] 22:00:23
A LOT OF THE UNITS WE HAVE 


[Captioner] 22:00:25
THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE CITY AND 


[Captioner] 22:00:29
ALSO WE JUST HEARD FROM ONE OF 


[Captioner] 22:00:30
THE CEREMONIAL ITEMS WE ARE 


[Captioner] 22:00:33
OPENING UP ANOTHER ALL 


[Captioner] 22:00:34
AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNIT FOR 


[Captioner] 22:00:36
PEOPLE TO COME AND LIVE IN.


[Captioner] 22:00:39
SO MY POINT HERE IS THAT IT 


[Captioner] 22:00:42
APPEARS THAT THE NAVIGATION 


[Captioner] 22:00:44
CENTER, THE ONE THAT HAD ALL OF 


[Captioner] 22:00:47
THIS CONTROVERSIAL, IN 2021, HAD 


[Captioner] 22:00:49
THE LEAST AMOUNT OF POLICE 


[Captioner] 22:00:51
ACTIVITY OF ALL OF THE OTHER 


[Captioner] 22:00:53
UNITS THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE.


[Captioner] 22:00:54
IS THAT CORRECT?


[Captioner] 22:00:55
>> Sean Washington:   YES.


[Captioner] 22:00:57
BASED ON THE DATA THAT WE'VE 


[Captioner] 22:01:01
COLLECTED, THAT IS ACCURATE.


[Captioner] 22:01:01
>> Councilmember Campbell:   


[Captioner] 22:01:01
YES.


[Captioner] 22:01:05
AND THAT IS RIGHT HERE IN THE -- 


[Captioner] 22:01:07
BEHIND CITY COUNCIL ACTUALLY, 


[Captioner] 22:01:08
RIGHT, CITY HALL.


[Captioner] 22:01:14
AND ALSO, AS I CAN SEE ON THIS 


[Captioner] 22:01:16
SHEET THAT YOU SENT ME AS WELL, 


[Captioner] 22:01:18
SUNRISE VILLAGE, WHICH IS RIGHT 


[Captioner] 22:01:20
AROUND THE CORNER THERE THAT, 


[Captioner] 22:01:23
ISN'T THAT BROWN ROAD IS THAT 


[Captioner] 22:01:25
SUNRISE VILLAGE, ALSO HAS THE 


[Captioner] 22:01:27
LEAST AMOUNT, EVEN LESS THAN 


[Captioner] 22:01:30
WHAT WE SEE HERE IN THE CITY.


[Captioner] 22:01:33
OF CRIME OR LESS -- WELL WHAT 


[Captioner] 22:01:35
YOU'RE CALLING CALL FOR 


[Captioner] 22:01:36
SERVICES.


[Captioner] 22:01:36
>> Sean Washington:   THAT IS 


[Captioner] 22:01:36
CORRECT.


[Captioner] 22:01:38
AND JUST FOR A POINT OF 


[Captioner] 22:01:40
CLARIFICATION, THE NUMBERS THAT 


[Captioner] 22:01:42
YOU SEE THERE ARE NOT 


[Captioner] 22:01:44
NECESSARILY ASSOCIATED WITH 


[Captioner] 22:01:45
CRIMINAL ACTIVITY BUT RATHER 


[Captioner] 22:01:48
CALLS FOR SERVICE WHICH COULD 


[Captioner] 22:01:48
INCLUDE SOME CRIME.


[Captioner] 22:01:51
SO IT COULD BE A DISTURBANCE, A 


[Captioner] 22:01:53
PERSON WHO'S MISSING AND THOSE 


[Captioner] 22:01:54
TYPE OF THINGS SO THOSE ARE 


[Captioner] 22:01:56
CALLS FOR SERVICE.


[Captioner] 22:01:56
>> Councilmember Campbell:   


[Captioner] 22:01:57
OKAY, OKAY.


[Captioner] 22:01:58
WELL I'M IN SUPPORT OF THIS 


[Captioner] 22:01:59
ITEM.


[Captioner] 22:02:02
AND SO IF -- IF NO ONE ELSE HAS 


[Captioner] 22:02:04
ANYTHING TO SAY I WOULD MOVE TO 


[Captioner] 22:02:04
APPROVE.


[Captioner] 22:02:06
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 22:02:07
I'LL NOTE THE MOTION.


[Captioner] 22:02:17
I KNOW NEXT IS COUNCILMAN -- 


[Captioner] 22:02:18
NEXT IS COUNCILMEMBER KENG, I'M 


[Captioner] 22:02:19
GOING IN ORDER.


[Captioner] 22:02:20
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 22:02:20
>> Councilmember Keng:   THANK 


[Captioner] 22:02:21
YOU MADAM MAYOR.


[Captioner] 22:02:22
I HAVE A QUICK QUESTION.


[Captioner] 22:02:25
DO YOU HAVE ANY DATA AS THE 


[Captioner] 22:02:29
PREVIOUS ROOM KEY PROGRAM, WHEN 


[Captioner] 22:02:31
DID THAT PROGRAM END?


[Captioner] 22:02:33
>> SO THERE WERE A NUMBER OF 


[Captioner] 22:02:36
ROOM KEY MOTELS THROUGHOUT THE 


[Captioner] 22:02:38
STATE REALLY AND THEY STARTED TO 


[Captioner] 22:02:40
WIND DOWN I WANT TO SAY AROUND 


[Captioner] 22:02:42
JULY 2021.


[Captioner] 22:02:43
>> Councilmember Keng:   21 GOT 


[Captioner] 22:02:44
IT.


[Captioner] 22:02:45
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 22:02:47
SO I KNOW THAT, YOU KNOW, THAT 


[Captioner] 22:02:49
PROGRAM IS VERY SUCCESSFUL AND, 


[Captioner] 22:02:52
YOU KNOW, COMPARED TO THE 


[Captioner] 22:02:53
HOUSING NAVIGATION THAT WE HAVE 


[Captioner] 22:02:55
RIGHT HERE IT'S AN ENTIRELY 


[Captioner] 22:02:57
DIFFERENT PROGRAM BECAUSE IT 


[Captioner] 22:02:58
PROVIDES EACH INDIVIDUAL THEIR 


[Captioner] 22:03:01
OWN SPACE LIKE A STUDIO, IT IS A 


[Captioner] 22:03:01
HOTEL ROOM.


[Captioner] 22:03:04
SO I KNOW THAT, YOU KNOW, SINCE 


[Captioner] 22:03:06
OUR HOUSING NAVIGATION CENTER 


[Captioner] 22:03:08
HAS BEEN PROVEN SUCCESSFUL BUT 


[Captioner] 22:03:10
WE ARE STILL SEEING A LOT OF 


[Captioner] 22:03:13
PEOPLE, YOU KNOW, HESITANT 


[Captioner] 22:03:16
MOVING -- TO MOVER INTO THE HNC 


[Captioner] 22:03:17
BECAUSE THEY WANT THEIR OWN 


[Captioner] 22:03:19
SPACE SO THEY ARE TENTING OUT BY 


[Captioner] 22:03:21
THE PARKS BY THE LIBRARY, YOU 


[Captioner] 22:03:22
KNOW, THEY ARE LIVING IN THEIR 


[Captioner] 22:03:31
CARS OR THEIR RV'S BUT TO 


[Captioner] 22:03:33
CONTINUE TO SUCCESS OF THE ROOM 


[Captioner] 22:03:35
KEY THAT PROVIDES THE STABLE 


[Captioner] 22:03:35
HOUSING FOR PEOPLE.


[Captioner] 22:03:38
AND MY HUSBAND IS A VETERAN AND 


[Captioner] 22:03:40
I KNOW THAT A SIGNIFICANT 


[Captioner] 22:03:42
PERCENTAGE OF OUR HOMELESS 


[Captioner] 22:03:44
POPULATION BEING VETERANS WHO 


[Captioner] 22:03:46
HAVE SERVED OUR COUNTRY WITH 


[Captioner] 22:03:47
THEIR LIVES.


[Captioner] 22:03:49
AND MANY OF THEM HAVE 


[Captioner] 22:03:53
DISABILITIES, MANY OF THEM HAVE 


[Captioner] 22:03:54
PTSD IN FACT I NEVER MENTIONED 


[Captioner] 22:03:57
THIS BEFORE BUT AT ONE POINT OF 


[Captioner] 22:03:59
DURING COLLEGE, MY HUSBAND WAS 


[Captioner] 22:04:00
ACTUALLY HOMELESS LIVING IN HIS 


[Captioner] 22:04:01
CAR.


[Captioner] 22:04:04
AND SO, YOU KNOW, MANY OF THESE 


[Captioner] 22:04:06
INDIVIDUALS WITHOUT SUPPORT 


[Captioner] 22:04:08
SYSTEM AND WITHOUT, YOU KNOW, 


[Captioner] 22:04:10
THOSE ACCESS OR HELP TO GET 


[Captioner] 22:04:12
BENEFITS, THEY WIND UP BEING ON 


[Captioner] 22:04:13
THE STREET.


[Captioner] 22:04:14
SO, YOU KNOW, FREMONT BEING THE 


[Captioner] 22:04:16
FOURTH LARGEST CITY IN THE BAY 


[Captioner] 22:04:20
AREA, WE'RE NOT YOU KNOW, WE'RE 


[Captioner] 22:04:23
NOT IMMUNE TO HAVING A HOMELESS 


[Captioner] 22:04:24
ISSUE, YOU KNOW, HAVING HOUSING 


[Captioner] 22:04:27
COST SO HIGH IN THIS AREA.


[Captioner] 22:04:30
AND I THINK, YOU KNOW, SEEING 


[Captioner] 22:04:33
SOME OF THE SUCCESS IN OUR CITY 


[Captioner] 22:04:35
AND, YOU KNOW, TO PROVIDE THIS 


[Captioner] 22:04:39
KIND OF HOUSING SOLUTIONS TO 


[Captioner] 22:04:41
THOSE MOST IN NEED, I THINK IS A 


[Captioner] 22:04:43
VERY IMPORTANT AND I WOULD FULLY 


[Captioner] 22:04:45
SUPPORT THE HOMEKEY, THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 22:04:47
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 22:04:50
NEXT IS COUNCILMEMBER SHAO.


[Captioner] 22:04:51
>> Councilmember Shao:   THANK 


[Captioner] 22:04:54
YOU MADAM MAYOR.


[Captioner] 22:04:56
A LOT OF PEOPLE COME TO US AND 


[Captioner] 22:04:58
EXPRESS THEIR CONCERNS ABOUT 


[Captioner] 22:05:01
PUBLIC SAFETY.


[Captioner] 22:05:05
AND I'VE HEARD THOSE CONCERNS 


[Captioner] 22:05:06
BEFORE.


[Captioner] 22:05:08
AND ESPECIALLY WHEN WE WERE 


[Captioner] 22:05:09
TALKING ABOUT NAVIGATION CENTER 


[Captioner] 22:05:11
IN 2019.


[Captioner] 22:05:13
AND FORTUNATELY, THE DATA PROVED 


[Captioner] 22:05:15
OTHERWISE.


[Captioner] 22:05:16
AND EVEN THOUGH WE DON'T HAVE 


[Captioner] 22:05:19
DATA FOR THE AFTER, FOR THE 


[Captioner] 22:05:21
HOMEKEY PROJECT, BASED ON 


[Captioner] 22:05:24
CURRENT DATA, I'M NOT THAT 


[Captioner] 22:05:28
CONCERNED ABOUT THE PUBLIC 


[Captioner] 22:05:29
SAFETY.


[Captioner] 22:05:34
WHAT I HAVE CONCERN ABOUT IS THE 


[Captioner] 22:05:37
GREAT INCREASE OF NUMBER OF 


[Captioner] 22:05:39
HOMELESS PEOPLE WITHIN THE THREE 


[Captioner] 22:05:41
YEARS IN OUR CITY.


[Captioner] 22:05:44
SOME PEOPLE SAY OH YOU CAN BLAME 


[Captioner] 22:05:46
IT ON THE PANDEMIC.


[Captioner] 22:05:49
BUT THE INCREASE IS 


[Captioner] 22:05:50
DISPROPORTIONAL.


[Captioner] 22:05:52
IT IS NOT ALL OVER ALL THE 


[Captioner] 22:05:54
CITIES OF ALAMEDA COUNTY.


[Captioner] 22:05:58
FOR CERTAIN CITIES, THE NUMBER 


[Captioner] 22:06:01
EVEN DROPPED WITHIN THE THREE 


[Captioner] 22:06:02
YEARS.


[Captioner] 22:06:05
SO I HAVE SOME MIXED FEELINGS.


[Captioner] 22:06:08
AS I SAY IF THE MORE WE DO TO 


[Captioner] 22:06:13
HELP THEM, THE MORE PEOPLE WILL 


[Captioner] 22:06:14
COME TO OUR CITY BECAUSE WE HAVE 


[Captioner] 22:06:16
RESOURCES TO PROVIDE.


[Captioner] 22:06:19
IT'S VERY HARD TO IMAGINE THAT 


[Captioner] 22:06:22
NOW THE OVER 1,000 HOMELESS 


[Captioner] 22:06:25
PEOPLE ARE ALL OR MAJORITY OF 


[Captioner] 22:06:28
THEM ARE FROM FREMONT.


[Captioner] 22:06:31
SO BECAUSE THE NUMBER DOESN'T 


[Captioner] 22:06:34
ADD UP.


[Captioner] 22:06:37
SO I'M QUITE SURE THAT THIS 


[Captioner] 22:06:39
PROJECT WILL HELP THOSE LIVING 


[Captioner] 22:06:41
ON THE STREET.


[Captioner] 22:06:43
THAT'S FOR SURE.


[Captioner] 22:06:47
BUT I STILL HAVE SOME DOUBT AS 


[Captioner] 22:06:50
TO IN THE FUTURE WHETHER THIS 


[Captioner] 22:06:53
PROJECT CAN DRAMATICALLY REDUCE 


[Captioner] 22:06:56
THE NUMBER OF HOMELESS PEOPLE IN 


[Captioner] 22:06:59
THE -- ON THE STREETS OF 


[Captioner] 22:06:59
FREMONT.


[Captioner] 22:07:02
YOU DO THE SIMPLE MATH.


[Captioner] 22:07:05
IF LET'S SAY WE DON'T SEIZE 15% 


[Captioner] 22:07:09
DROP OF-SEE 15% DROP OF OUR 


[Captioner] 22:07:12
HOMENESS PEOPLE THEN YOU MAY 


[Captioner] 22:07:13
WONDER WHAT'S HAPPENING?


[Captioner] 22:07:15
WHERE ARE THE NEW HOMELESS 


[Captioner] 22:07:18
PEOPLE WHO SHOW UP IN OUR CITY?


[Captioner] 22:07:21
SO IN THAT CASE, I THINK THAT 


[Captioner] 22:07:24
JUST MEANS THAT WE'LL KEEP ON 


[Captioner] 22:07:26
WORKING HARDER AND HARDER AND 


[Captioner] 22:07:29
HARDER AND GET MORE AND MORE 


[Captioner] 22:07:30
HOMELESS PEOPLE?


[Captioner] 22:07:33
FOR THAT I'M NOT FULLY 


[Captioner] 22:07:33
CONVINCED.


[Captioner] 22:07:36
ON THE OTHER HAND, I WORK 


[Captioner] 22:07:38
ACTUALLY I'M THE REPRESENTATIVE 


[Captioner] 22:07:40
OF THE FREMONT CITY ON THE 


[Captioner] 22:07:41
ALAMEDA COUNTY HOUSING 


[Captioner] 22:07:43
AUTHORITY.


[Captioner] 22:07:46
AND THE WHOLE GOAL IS TO PROVIDE 


[Captioner] 22:07:48
ALMOST FREE HOUSING TO PEOPLE IN 


[Captioner] 22:07:49
ALAMEDA COUNTY.


[Captioner] 22:07:52
AND WE, AS I MENTIONED TWO WEEKS 


[Captioner] 22:07:58
AGO, HAVE PROJECT BASED 


[Captioner] 22:07:59
VOUCHERS.


[Captioner] 22:08:01
AND ONE IMPORTANT TYPE OF 


[Captioner] 22:08:05
PROJECT IS THE HOMEKEY PROJECT 


[Captioner] 22:08:07
AS SOMEONE MENTIONED, NEW WORK 


[Captioner] 22:08:11
 NEWARK HAS 


[Captioner] 22:08:13
HOMEKEY PROJECT.


[Captioner] 22:08:15
MANY OTHER CITIES IN ALAMEDA 


[Captioner] 22:08:17
COUNTY ALSO HAVE HOMEKEY 


[Captioner] 22:08:19
PROJECTS THUS THEY HAVE THE 


[Captioner] 22:08:20
VOUCHERS GIVEN BY THE FEDERAL 


[Captioner] 22:08:24
GOVERNMENT TO THOSE PROJECTS.


[Captioner] 22:08:25
SO THERE IS A THEREOF LIKE IF 


[Captioner] 22:08:28
YOU DON'T WANT TO GRAB THOSE -- 


[Captioner] 22:08:29
THERE IS A PHILOSOPHY LIKE IF 


[Captioner] 22:08:31
YOU DON'T WANT TO GRAB THOSE 


[Captioner] 22:08:33
RESOURCES NOW YOU HAVE TO USE 


[Captioner] 22:08:35
ALL YOUR OWN MONEY TO DEAL WITH 


[Captioner] 22:08:38
THIS ISSUE, THE ISSUE IS THERE.


[Captioner] 22:08:43
SO I GUESS WE BETTER JUST ASK 


[Captioner] 22:08:45
FOR STATE MONEY, $35 MILLION, 


[Captioner] 22:08:48
PLUS THE VOUCHERS THAT WE CAN 


[Captioner] 22:08:51
GET TO HELP THE PEOPLE THAT WE 


[Captioner] 22:08:53
CURRENTLY HAVE.


[Captioner] 22:08:56
AND I'LL DO MY BEST, YOU KNOW, 


[Captioner] 22:08:58
TO TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT FREMONT 


[Captioner] 22:09:00
GETS OUR FAIR SHARE.


[Captioner] 22:09:03
BUT IN THE FUTURE, I SERIOUSLY 


[Captioner] 22:09:07
DOUBT THAT BY 2026 WE WILL 


[Captioner] 22:09:10
ELIMINATE HOMELESS IN THE COUNTY 


[Captioner] 22:09:15
OF ALAMEDA, THAT I DON'T BELIEVE 


[Captioner] 22:09:16
SO.


[Captioner] 22:09:18
DO THE SIMPLE MATH IT IS 2023 


[Captioner] 22:09:19
RIGHT NOW.


[Captioner] 22:09:22
IF IT IS TRUE BY THEN, THE 


[Captioner] 22:09:24
HOMELESS IS COMPLETELY 


[Captioner] 22:09:29
ELIMINATED, THAT MEANS WE DON'T 


[Captioner] 22:09:30
NEED THE HOUSING NAVIGATION 


[Captioner] 22:09:32
CENTER, WE DON'T NEED A LOT OF 


[Captioner] 22:09:34
OTHER PROGRAMS.


[Captioner] 22:09:37
AND I'M SURE WE'RE STILL TRYING 


[Captioner] 22:09:40
TO SECURE RESOURCES FOR LONG 


[Captioner] 22:09:43
TERM FUNDING FOR THOSE PROGRAMS.


[Captioner] 22:09:46
SO I GUESS WE HAVE TO TAKE THAT 


[Captioner] 22:09:48
WITH A GRAIN OF SALT.


[Captioner] 22:09:54
SO MY VIEW IS NOT THAT 


[Captioner] 22:09:54
OPTIMISTIC.


[Captioner] 22:09:57
BUT I AM STRUGGLING FOR THE TIME 


[Captioner] 22:09:59
BEING WE HAVE TO DO OUR BEST TO 


[Captioner] 22:10:01
ADDRESS THE PROBLEM.


[Captioner] 22:10:03
BUT I DON'T KNOW IN THE FUTURE 


[Captioner] 22:10:05
WHERE IT WOULD LEAD US TO.


[Captioner] 22:10:07
EVEN IF WE WORK HARDER AND 


[Captioner] 22:10:09
HARDER AND HARDER.


[Captioner] 22:10:12
SO I JUST WANT TO, YOU KNOW, PUT 


[Captioner] 22:10:15
IT ON THE RECORD THAT IF WE 


[Captioner] 22:10:19
DON'T SEE A DROP OF TOTAL AMOUNT 


[Captioner] 22:10:22
OF HOMELESS PEOPLE, AT LEAST BY 


[Captioner] 22:10:25
15%, IN LET'S SAY THREE YEARS, 


[Captioner] 22:10:29
FOUR YEARS, THEN WE HAVE TO ASK 


[Captioner] 22:10:30
WHAT'S HAPPENING.


[Captioner] 22:10:33
ARE WE ON THE RIGHT DIRECTION OR 


[Captioner] 22:10:36
SHALL WE JUST TAKE A PAUSE AND 


[Captioner] 22:10:37
THINK ABOUT IT?


[Captioner] 22:10:43
>> Mayor Mei:   OKAY.


[Captioner] 22:10:43
THANKS.


[Captioner] 22:10:46
NEXT IS COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN 


[Captioner] 22:10:47
THEN I'LL GET MY COMMENTS AWF 


[Captioner] 22:10:48
THAT.


[Captioner] 22:10:51
 AFTER 


[Captioner] 22:10:52
THAT.


[Captioner] 22:10:52
>> Councilmember Salwan:   THANK 


[Captioner] 22:10:53
YOU MADAM MAYOR.


[Captioner] 22:10:55
WE HAVE A RISING HOMELESS ISSUE 


[Captioner] 22:10:58
AND, YOU KNOW, THIS IS A PILOT 


[Captioner] 22:10:59
PROGRAM THIS IS THE FIRST TIME 


[Captioner] 22:11:00
WE'LL BE DOING THIS.


[Captioner] 22:11:04
WHEN WE DID THE HNC WE HAD A LOT 


[Captioner] 22:11:06
OF FOLKS THAT WERE UPSET AND WE 


[Captioner] 22:11:07
WENT AHEAD AND DIT RIGHT IN OUR 


[Captioner] 22:11:10
BACKYARD RIGHT IN CITY HALL.


[Captioner] 22:11:11
THINGS HAVE BREN WORKING WELL.


[Captioner] 22:11:13
THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO 


[Captioner] 22:11:15
GET GRANT FUNDING FOR AN AREA IN 


[Captioner] 22:11:16
AFFORDABLE HOUSING WHICH WE 


[Captioner] 22:11:18
CAN'T BUILD, NOBODY WANTS TO DO 


[Captioner] 22:11:20
EXTREMELY LOW OR VERY LOW 


[Captioner] 22:11:23
HOUSING FOR HOMELESS 


[Captioner] 22:11:23
INDIVIDUALS.


[Captioner] 22:11:25
AND WE ALWAYS COMPLAIN ABOUT THE 


[Captioner] 22:11:26
DOS OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING.


[Captioner] 22:11:29
WE TALK ABOUT LUXURY CONDOS FOR 


[Captioner] 22:11:31
THE RICH BUT THEN AFFORDABLE 


[Captioner] 22:11:33
HOUSING COST $800,000 WHICH IS 


[Captioner] 22:11:35
ALMOST A MILLION DOLLARS SO 


[Captioner] 22:11:36
AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS REALLY NOT 


[Captioner] 22:11:37
THAT CHEAP.


[Captioner] 22:11:39
SO WE DO HAVE THIS OPPORTUNITY 


[Captioner] 22:11:41
HERE TO TAKE OVER A PROJECT FOR 


[Captioner] 22:11:44
PHYSICAL WAS IT 250 OR 260,000 


[Captioner] 22:11:46
WHICH I THINK IS A BARGAIN IN 


[Captioner] 22:11:47
THE BAY AREA.


[Captioner] 22:11:49
SO I THINK THAT BASED ON ALL THE 


[Captioner] 22:11:51
DATA AND INFORMATION WE HAVE I 


[Captioner] 22:11:52
THINK THIS IS, YOU KNOW, THE 


[Captioner] 22:11:54
RIGHT THING TO DID TO HELP CHIP 


[Captioner] 22:11:56
AWAY AT THE HOMELESS ISSUES IN 


[Captioner] 22:11:57
FREMONT AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN 


[Captioner] 22:11:59
BUILD A ROBUST CASE LIKE WE HAVE 


[Captioner] 22:12:01
DONE WITH THE HNC TO MAKE SURE 


[Captioner] 22:12:04
THAT THIS IS A GOOD PLACE THAT'S 


[Captioner] 22:12:06
SAFE FOR FOLKS THAT GETS THE 


[Captioner] 22:12:06
SERVICES.


[Captioner] 22:12:08
HOPEFULLY CITY STAFF IS 


[Captioner] 22:12:11
PROACTIVE IN RECRUITING FOLKS 


[Captioner] 22:12:12
AHEAD OF TIME SO WE'RE READY TO 


[Captioner] 22:12:14
GO, GOT A LOT OF OUR FOLKS THAT 


[Captioner] 22:12:17
ARE UNHOUSED NOW INTO HOUSING, 


[Captioner] 22:12:18
HOPEFULLY OUR PUBLIC SAFETY 


[Captioner] 22:12:19
OFFICIALS REACH OUT TO OTHER 


[Captioner] 22:12:22
CITIES LIKE MILPITAS OR SOME OF 


[Captioner] 22:12:24
THE CITIES THAT WERE MENTIONED 


[Captioner] 22:12:24
HAVING THOSE ISSUES.


[Captioner] 22:12:27
MAYBE WE CAN LEARN THE LESSONS 


[Captioner] 22:12:29
OR MISTAKES THAT THEY MADE SO WE 


[Captioner] 22:12:31
CAN BE MORE PROACTIVE TO MAKE 


[Captioner] 22:12:33
SURE WE MAKE A MODEL PROJECT FOR 


[Captioner] 22:12:34
OUR COMMUNITY.


[Captioner] 22:12:36
AND YOU KNOW MANY PEOPLE DON'T 


[Captioner] 22:12:39
REALIZE IT BUT MOTEL 6 


[Captioner] 22:12:42
ATTRACTION ALL SORTS OF FOLKS.


[Captioner] 22:12:43
-- ATTRACTS A LOT OF FOLKS.


[Captioner] 22:12:46
THERE IS A LOT OF CALLS FOR 


[Captioner] 22:12:48
SERVICE AND A LOT OF ISSUES AT 


[Captioner] 22:12:50
THE MOTEL 6, NOT LIKE THE BRAND 


[Captioner] 22:12:52
BUT THERE IS A LOT OF ISSUES 


[Captioner] 22:12:53
LIKE THAT.


[Captioner] 22:12:56
ISLANDER HAD THAT ISSUE AS WELL, 


[Captioner] 22:12:58
THE PREVIOUS MAYORS, SEVERAL 


[Captioner] 22:12:59
WERE CONCERNED ABOUT THE ISSUES 


[Captioner] 22:12:59
THERE.


[Captioner] 22:13:02
WE TOOK OVER THE ISLANDERS, WE 


[Captioner] 22:13:04
HAVE HOMELESS FOLKS LIVING THERE 


[Captioner] 22:13:07
NOW AND WE HAD LESS ISSUES THAN 


[Captioner] 22:13:08
PRIOR TO THAT.


[Captioner] 22:13:09
I DON'T THINK EVERYBODY IS GOING 


[Captioner] 22:13:11
TO BE HAPPY BUT THIS IS THE 


[Captioner] 22:13:13
RIGHT THING TO DO, LET'S DO THIS 


[Captioner] 22:13:15
MAKE IT SUCCESSFUL AND MAKE IT A 


[Captioner] 22:13:17
MODEL PROJECT FOR NOT ONLY 


[Captioner] 22:13:18
FREMONT BUT THE REST OF THE BAY 


[Captioner] 22:13:21
AREA, THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 22:13:22
>> Mayor Mei:   SO THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 22:13:24
I WANT TO SHARE SOME OF MY 


[Captioner] 22:13:26
COMMENTS AT THIS TIME.


[Captioner] 22:13:30
FOR ME I'VE BEEN VISITING THE 


[Captioner] 22:13:32
BROWN SHELTER SINCE MY CHILDREN 


[Captioner] 22:13:33
WERE YOUNGER AND WE'VE GONE OUT 


[Captioner] 22:13:35
TO SERVE FOOD AND TO HELP IN THE 


[Captioner] 22:13:37
COMMUNITY.


[Captioner] 22:13:38
AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I'VE 


[Captioner] 22:13:40
ALWAYS TAUGHT AND I THOUGHT VERY 


[Captioner] 22:13:41
STRONGLY ABOUT IS I'VE SHARED IN 


[Captioner] 22:13:44
THE PAST, IS THAT IT'S IMPORTANT 


[Captioner] 22:13:47
FOR US TO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT 


[Captioner] 22:13:48
AFFORDABLE HOUSING MONTH THAT WE 


[Captioner] 22:13:49
LOVE ALL THE PEOPLE AND WE LOVE 


[Captioner] 22:13:51
ALL OUR NEIGHBORS EVEN THOSE WHO 


[Captioner] 22:13:53
ARE UNHOUSED.


[Captioner] 22:13:54
AND IT IS A VERY DIFFICULT 


[Captioner] 22:13:55
CONVERSATION.


[Captioner] 22:13:56
I KNOW THAT THERE ARE MANY 


[Captioner] 22:13:57
PEOPLE WHO HAVE FEAR BUT AT THE 


[Captioner] 22:13:59
SAME TIME I THINK THE ANALOGY I 


[Captioner] 22:14:02
GIVE AT TIMES IS PEOPLE WILL SAY 


[Captioner] 22:14:03
THAT NUMBERS HAVE INCREASED AND 


[Captioner] 22:14:05
CERTAINLY IN CALIFORNIA THAT'S 


[Captioner] 22:14:06
WHAT WE HAVE SEEN AS A 


[Captioner] 22:14:06
TELECOMMUNICATIONS.


[Captioner] 22:14:08
BUT IN TALKING TO MY FELLOW 


[Captioner] 22:14:09
NEIGHBORING MAYORS IN OTHER 


[Captioner] 22:14:11
CITIES I DID TALK TO THE ONES 


[Captioner] 22:14:13
THAT HAVE THE HOUSING NAVIGATION 


[Captioner] 22:14:15
CENTERS, AS WELL AS THOSE WHO 


[Captioner] 22:14:16
HAVE HOMEKEY AND I HAVE WENT OUT 


[Captioner] 22:14:19
FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO 


[Captioner] 22:14:20
MOTHER'S DAY FOR SAFE PARKING TO 


[Captioner] 22:14:22
SEE IT FIRSTHAND.


[Captioner] 22:14:23
I'M NOT THE TYPE OF PERSON THAT 


[Captioner] 22:14:24
WILL JUST MAKE THIS DECISION 


[Captioner] 22:14:26
WITHOUT LOOKING AT THINGS AND 


[Captioner] 22:14:28
FOR THE RECORD I DID GO DOWN TO 


[Captioner] 22:14:30
LOOK AT THOSE HOMEKEY PROJECTS 


[Captioner] 22:14:31
BECAUSE I FEEL SO STRONGLY ABOUT 


[Captioner] 22:14:32
IT.


[Captioner] 22:14:35
I WILL SAY ALSO, HAVING BEEN 


[Captioner] 22:14:37
THROUGH THESE DIFFERENT 


[Captioner] 22:14:39
EXPERIENCES I TAKE GREAT PRIDE 


[Captioner] 22:14:40
IN THE FACT THAT I KNOW THAT 


[Captioner] 22:14:42
DURING THE PANDEMIC AND OTHER 


[Captioner] 22:14:43
TIMES WE'VE DELIVERED FOOD AND 


[Captioner] 22:14:45
SERVICES TO OUR HOUSING 


[Captioner] 22:14:47
NAVIGATION CENTER TO ISLANDER 


[Captioner] 22:14:49
MOTEL AND HAVING SPENT TIME TO 


[Captioner] 22:14:50
TALK TO THE RESIDENTS, 


[Captioner] 22:14:52
THEMSELVES, FIRSTHAND DURING 


[Captioner] 22:14:53
SOME OF THESE DIFFICULT TIMES 


[Captioner] 22:14:57
WHETHER IT'S THE STORMS, I AM 


[Captioner] 22:14:58
VERY APPRECIATIVE OF HOW CARING 


[Captioner] 22:15:00
THEY ARE FOR ONE ANOTHER IN THE 


[Captioner] 22:15:01
LOCATIONS.


[Captioner] 22:15:04
THAT WHEN IT COMES TO DELIVERING 


[Captioner] 22:15:05
FOOD BOXES OR BRINGING THEM 


[Captioner] 22:15:07
AFTER FOOD SERVICES THEY CAME 


[Captioner] 22:15:08
OUT TO HELP ME CARRY THE FOOD 


[Captioner] 22:15:09
IN.


[Captioner] 22:15:11
THEY WOULD ALSO BE SUPPORTIVE OF 


[Captioner] 22:15:12
ONE ANOTHER IN TRYING TO HELP 


[Captioner] 22:15:13
FIND JOBS.


[Captioner] 22:15:15
AND SO WHILE THERE ARE MANY 


[Captioner] 22:15:16
PEOPLE WHO HAVE STRUGGLED FOR 


[Captioner] 22:15:17
MANY DIFFERENT ISSUES THE PEOPLE 


[Captioner] 22:15:19
THAT I'VE MET THROUGH HOUSING 


[Captioner] 22:15:22
NAVIGATION CENTER THROUGH 


[Captioner] 22:15:24
ISLANDER MOTEL THROUGH BROWN 


[Captioner] 22:15:25
SHELTER AND VISITING THE HOMEKEY 


[Captioner] 22:15:26
ARE EXTREMELY APPRECIATIVE OF 


[Captioner] 22:15:27
THE OPPORTUNITY.


[Captioner] 22:15:32
MUCH LIKE ANY OTHER APARTMENT OR 


[Captioner] 22:15:33
RERNL HOUSING THERE ARE GOOD 


[Captioner] 22:15:34
ACTORS AND BAD ACTORS.


[Captioner] 22:15:38
BUT IN TALKING TO SO MANY OTHER 


[Captioner] 22:15:40
MY NEIGHBORING CITIES I THINK IT 


[Captioner] 22:15:41
IS IMPORTANT THAT WE FIND A 


[Captioner] 22:15:45
PARTNER THAT WORKS.


[Captioner] 22:15:47
WE ARE LOOKING AT THE DEVELOPER 


[Captioner] 22:15:48
AS WELL AS THE SUPPORTIVE 


[Captioner] 22:15:49
SERVICES.


[Captioner] 22:15:51
SOME OF THE CHALLENGES AND I'VE 


[Captioner] 22:15:52
HEARD MANY OF THE PUBLIC 


[Captioner] 22:15:54
COMMENTS AS WELL AS READ THE 


[Captioner] 22:15:54
E-MAILS.


[Captioner] 22:15:55
WERE ABOUT THE CITIES AND SOME 


[Captioner] 22:15:57
OF THEM HAVE HAD DIFFERENT 


[Captioner] 22:15:59
EXPERIENCES BECAUSE THEY'VE HAD 


[Captioner] 22:16:00
DIFFERENT SERVICE PROVIDERS.


[Captioner] 22:16:02
SO THAT'S SOMETHING I'M HOPING 


[Captioner] 22:16:03
TO LEARN FROM.


[Captioner] 22:16:04
BUT AT THE SAME TIME, IN TALKING 


[Captioner] 22:16:07
TO SOME OF AGAIN SOME OF MY 


[Captioner] 22:16:08
FELLOW MAYORS THIS MORNING AND 


[Captioner] 22:16:09
OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS TO 


[Captioner] 22:16:11
DO NOTHING IS NOT AN OPTION FOR 


[Captioner] 22:16:13
ME.


[Captioner] 22:16:16
AND THAT I FEEL VERY, VERY, VERY 


[Captioner] 22:16:18
STRONGLY THAT I ABSOLUTELY AM 


[Captioner] 22:16:20
SUPPORTIVE OF THIS.


[Captioner] 22:16:22
100%, 110%.


[Captioner] 22:16:24
I KNOW THERE'S PEOPLE WHO HAVE 


[Captioner] 22:16:26
DIFFERENCE OF OPINIONS BUT I 


[Captioner] 22:16:28
THINK HAVING BEEN IN THE POINT 


[Captioner] 22:16:30
IN TIME COUNTS I THINK THAT OUR 


[Captioner] 22:16:32
NUMBERS HAVE RISEN IN SOME WAYS 


[Captioner] 22:16:33
BUT THAT'S BECAUSE WE ARE VERY 


[Captioner] 22:16:34
DILIGENT.


[Captioner] 22:16:36
AND I WILL SAY THAT BECAUSE I'VE 


[Captioner] 22:16:37
PARTICIPATED IN EVERY SINGLE 


[Captioner] 22:16:41
POINT IN TIME COUNT AND I HAVE 


[Captioner] 22:16:42
TO THANK OUR VOLUNTEERS AND THE 


[Captioner] 22:16:44
PEOPLE WHO CAME OUT TO DO IT.


[Captioner] 22:16:48
THE FACT THAT WE ARE SO DIGIT, 


[Captioner] 22:16:51
LAST TIME IT WAS 34° AND HI SIX 


[Captioner] 22:16:52
PAIRS OF PANTS ON.


[Captioner] 22:16:54
FOR ME IT WAS SOMETHING THAT I 


[Captioner] 22:16:56
WOULDN'T SKIP OUT ON AND EVEN IF 


[Captioner] 22:16:57
I'M NOT ELECTED I WOULD STILL 


[Captioner] 22:16:59
CONTINUE TO SERVE IN THAT 


[Captioner] 22:17:01
CAPACITY BECAUSE I THINK I CAN'T 


[Captioner] 22:17:03
TURN AN EYE AWAY FROM THAT.


[Captioner] 22:17:06
I THINK THAT IN THIS TIME 


[Captioner] 22:17:07
PERIOD, WE'VE HAD OVER THE YEARS 


[Captioner] 22:17:09
THE PROJECT ROOM KEY AND I'VE 


[Captioner] 22:17:10
BEEN TO VISIT THOSE LOCATIONS 


[Captioner] 22:17:12
TOO.


[Captioner] 22:17:13
AS WELL AS OUR SHELTERS.


[Captioner] 22:17:15
AND I THINK THAT THIS IS 


[Captioner] 22:17:15
ABSOLUTELY SOMETHING THAT I 


[Captioner] 22:17:17
WOULD LIKE TO SEE PASSED.


[Captioner] 22:17:19
I HAVE WRITTEN THE LETTER ON 


[Captioner] 22:17:22
BEHALF OF THE COUNTY IN THE PAST 


[Captioner] 22:17:23
FOR ALL OF THE MAYORS FOR THIS 


[Captioner] 22:17:25
SUPPORT.


[Captioner] 22:17:27
AND I'VE ALSO WRITTEN ONE AT THE 


[Captioner] 22:17:29
FEDERAL LEVEL FOR US AT THE U.S. 


[Captioner] 22:17:31
CONFERENCE OF MAYORS BECAUSE I 


[Captioner] 22:17:33
STILL STRONGLY BELIEVE IN THIS, 


[Captioner] 22:17:35
THAT I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE 


[Captioner] 22:17:37
HOUSING, SOLUTIONS, WRAP AROUND 


[Captioner] 22:17:37
SERVICES.


[Captioner] 22:17:39
THERE IS NO SINGLE SILVER BULLET 


[Captioner] 22:17:41
THAT CURES EVERYTHING BUT I 


[Captioner] 22:17:42
THINK IT IS A COMBINATION EVER 


[Captioner] 22:17:44
ALL OF OUR EFFORTS AND I HAVE 


[Captioner] 22:17:46
FULL FAITH IN OUR STAFF, IN OUR 


[Captioner] 22:17:48
COMMUNITY IN OUR COMMUNITY IN 


[Captioner] 22:17:49
OUR POLICE AND IN OUR COUNCIL TO 


[Captioner] 22:17:51
MAKE THIS DECISION AND TO MOVE 


[Captioner] 22:17:52
FORWARD WITH IT.


[Captioner] 22:17:53
AND IT'S NOT ONE THAT I'M GOING 


[Captioner] 22:17:56
TO JUST MAKE A DECISION VOTE ON 


[Captioner] 22:17:58
SOMETHING AND WALK AWAY, IT IS 


[Captioner] 22:17:59
SOMETHING I'M COMMITTED TO AND I 


[Captioner] 22:18:01
WILL BE FOLLOWING UP ON AN I 


[Captioner] 22:18:03
WILL BE DOING EVERYTHING IN MY 


[Captioner] 22:18:05
POWER TO MAKE SURE IT'S 


[Captioner] 22:18:06
SUCCESSFUL.


[Captioner] 22:18:08
I HAVE HAD A MOTION, I'VE HAD A 


[Captioner] 22:18:10

[Captioner] 22:18:11
