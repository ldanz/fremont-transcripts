ALL RIGHT.

19:08:57 SONIA KHAN.
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH, THIS IS SONIA KHAN, HUMAN RELATIONS COMMISSION 
19:09:01 SPEAKING ON MY OWN BEHALF THIS EVENING.
I'M GOING TO START READING THE REMARKS 
19:09:09 BY A STATEMENT ISSUED BY THE ACLU AT 2:00 P.M. THIS AFTERNOON.
DEREK CHAUVIN HAS BEEN CONVICTED OF 
19:09:13 THE MURDER OF GEORGE FLOYD.
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MINNESOTA STATE HISTORY, A WHITE POLICE OFFICER HAS 
19:09:18 BEEN HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR KILLING A BLACK MAN.
WHILE TODAY'S VERDICT IS A SMALL WIN 
19:09:26 FOR POLICE ACCOUNTABILITY, AND MAY HELP HEAL A GRIEVING COMMUNITY, THE SYSTEMS THAT ALLOWED GEORGE TO BE MURDERED, 
19:09:31 RIPPING HIM AWAY FROM HIS FAMILY AND THE COMMUNITIES THAT LOVED HIM SO MUCH REMAIN FULLY INTACT.

19:09:36 GEORGE FLOYD WILL NEVER AGAIN PLAY GAMES WITH HIS DAUGHTER.
HE'LL NEVER GO ON WALKS THROUGH THE 
19:09:41 PARK WITH HIS FIANCE COURTNEY.
HE WILL NEVER PLAY BASKETBALL WITH HIS BROTHER.

19:09:49 TRUE JUSTICE WOULD MEAN GEORGE FLOYD WAS NEVER KILLED IN THE FIRST PLACE.
THIS RACIST SYSTEM OF POLICING ALSO 
19:09:55 RESULTED IN THE KILLING OF DAWN TAI WRIGHT BY POLICE LESS THAN 10 MILES FROM THAT TRIAL AND IT WILL CONTINUE 
19:10:00 TAKING LIVES BY POLICE VIOLENCE AND INCARCERATION UNTIL WE OVERHAUL IT ENTIRELY.

19:10:06 GEORGE FLOYD SHOULD NOT HAVE DIED UNDER AN OFFICER'S KNEE, HE SHOULD STILL BE ALIVE TODAY.

19:10:13 SO SHOULD DAUNTE WRIGHT, BREONNA TAYLOR AND COUNTLESS OTHER BLACK PEOPLE KILLED BY POLICE.

19:10:19 TRUE JUSTICE FOR GEORGE FLOYD MEANS RENEWING OUR CONVICTION TO CREATE A WORLD WHERE POLICE DO NOT HAVE THE 
19:10:25 OPPORTUNITY TO USE VIOLENCE TO TARGET BLACK PEOPLE.
WE MUST ENSURE POLICE ARE NOT THE ONLY 
19:10:31 RESORT FOR ADDRESSING HARM.
WE MUST REMOVE POLICE FROM THE LOW LEVEL ENFORCEMENT OF OFFENSES THAT 
19:10:39 SHOULDN'T BE CRIMINALIZED.
WE MUST DIVERT FUNDING FROM POLICING AND TOWARDS  COMMUNITY-BASED 
19:10:45 SERVICES.
WE DESERVE TO BE TRULY SAFE.
AND I'LL JUST ADD A REMARK OF MY OWN.

19:10:52 I LIVED IN EAST L.A. IN THE CENTER OF THE NEIGHBORHOODS ON THE AFTERNOON THAT THE VERDICT CAME DOWN WITH THE 
19:10:58 RODNEY KING BEATING TRIAL, AND I WAS WORKING AT THE COUNTY HOSPITAL, AND THERE WERE NURSES THERE IS WHO 
19:11:06 PROMPTLY AT 3:00 P.M. STARTED PACKING THEIR BAGS AND GOING HOME WITH THE PHRASE "WE REMEMBER -- WE LIVE IN 
19:11:12 WATTS AND WE REMEMBER 1968."
THIS PROBLEM IS AN OLD PROBLEM, AND YOU'VE HEARD ME ALREADY DESCRIBE IN 
19:11:18 THE PAST WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH IS SYSTEMIC POLICE STATION.
I WANT TO REMIND EVERYBODY THAT THAT 
19:11:24 FEELING OF DREAD AND FEAR THAT WE ALL FELT WHILE WE WERE AT PEAK TENSION WAITING FOR THIS VERDICT TO COME DOWN 
19:11:30 THIS AFTERNOON, THAT WAS A MEASURE OF THE TRUST ISSUES THAT WE ARE DEALING WITH IN POLICING IN THE UNITED STATES, 
19:11:36 AND I HOPE THAT WE WILL ALL BE ABLE TO WORK TOGETHER TO FIND A WAY TO REFORM THINGS BEFORE IT GETS OUT OF HAND.

19:11:43 THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
THE NEXT SPEAKER IS KELLY ABREU.

19:11:52 WELCOME, KELLY.
>> THANK YOU.
THIS CITY ORDINANCE, PARTICULAR CITY 
19:11:59 ORDINANCE SPELLS OUT  DETAILED REQUIREMENTS FOR EXACTLY HOW MANY PARKING SPACES ARE REQUIRED TO BE 
19:12:05 BUILT ON PRIVATE LAND --
>> Councilmember Kassan: I THINK YOU'RE ON THE WRONG ITEM.

19:12:12 WE'RE NOT --
>> Mayor Mei: THIS IS PUBLIC COMMUNICATIONS FOR ITEMS NOT ON THE 
19:12:19 AGENDA.
>> KELLY, WE'RE NOT THERE YET.
>> Mayor Mei: THE NEXT ITEM WILL BE 
19:12:24 THAT.
BUT YES, IF YOU COULD -- WE WILL TRY TO KEEP PEOPLE ON TRACK WITH THE 
19:12:27 AGENDA ITEMS.
THANK YOU, KELLY.
WE'LL CALL YOU IN JUST A MINUTE.

19:12:35 THE NEXT AGENDA ITEM, SEEING NO OTHER PUBLIC COMMENTS, THE NEXT AGENDA ITEM ARE ITEMS THAT WERE PULLED FROM THE 
19:12:40 CONSENT  CALENDAR, WHICH INCLUDE ITEM 2D.
WHICH IS THE SECOND READING AND 
19:12:47 ADOPTION OF THE ORDINANCE OF THE CITY OF FREMONT AMENDING VARIOUS CHAPTERS OF THE MUNICIPAL CODE, TITLE 10.

19:13:00 AND TITLE 18, TO CLARIFY ENHANCED DEFINITIONS.
SO I'LL CALL THE SPEAKERS THAT PULLED 
19:13:05 THE ITEM, AND I BELIEVE, KELLY, YOU WERE ONE OF THE SPEAKERS THAT PULLED THIS ITEM.

19:13:09 >> YES.
THANK YOU.
THIS CITY ORDINANCE SPELLS OUT ONCE 
19:13:16 GWENDY TAILED REQUIREMENTS FOR EXACTLY HOW MANY PARKING SPACES ARE REQUIRED ON PRIVATE LAND FOR VARIOUS LAND 
19:13:20 USES.
ASSEMBLY, COMMERCIAL,  HEALTHCARE, RESIDENTIAL.

19:13:27 THERE'S 50 PAGES OF DETAILED -- 49 PAGES OF DETAILED RULES IN THERE.
BUT THE CITY HAS NEVER BOTHERED TO 
19:13:34 LOOK AT WHERE THE REAL PARKING PROBLEM IS THESE DAYS.
CITY PLANNERS, LAWMAKERS ARE LOOKING 
19:13:42 THE OTHER WAY WHILE HANDING OUT DOZENS OF PARKING TICKETS, EACH MONTH NEAR MISSION PEAK REGIONAL PARK.

19:13:47 THIS PARTICULAR CITY ORDINANCE HASN'T ANY PARKING GUIDELINES FOR REGIONAL PARKS.

19:13:54 SO WHEN THE PARK DISTRICT DEVELOPS A NEW REGIONAL PARK, RESIDENTS WITHIN WALKING DISTANCE BENEFIT FROM 
19:14:02 APPRECIATION IN HOUSE VALUES, AND THOSE RESIDENTS FEEL SPECIAL.
THEY WANT THEIR FAIRY GODMOTHER, THE 
19:14:08 PARK DISTRICT, TO WAVE A MAGIC WAND AND MAKE FREE PARKING APPEAR.
THEY WANT THE CITY COUNCIL TO RESTRICT 
19:14:14 THE PARKING ON THE CITY STREETS AND LIMIT ACCESS FOR OUTSIDERS.
THEY WANT THE PROPERTY OWNERS OF TWO 
19:14:21 COUNTIES TO PAY PROPERTY TAXES AND PARCEL TAXES FOR ALL THOSE REGIONAL PARKS AND PARK RANGERS, BUT LIMIT THE 
19:14:27 ACCESS TO A PRIVILEGED FEW.
WHEN THE CITY BUILT THE NEW SABERCAT TRAIL AND RESTROOMS, THE CITY 
19:14:34 REPURPOSED EXISTING STREET PARKING.
THE CITY DIDN'T BLOCK PARKING NEAR THE ENTRANCES FOR ITS OWN TRAIL.

19:14:43 CITIES LIKE FREMONT SHOULD STOP POINTING FINGERS AT THE REGIONAL PARK DISTRICT WHILE DEMANDING CONCIERGE 
19:14:46 SERVICE.
THE CITY SHOULD BE A PARTNER, NOT A FREELOADER.

19:14:56 THE CITY NEEDS TO DO ITS SHARE TO EXPAND PARKING FACILITIES.
OUR POLITICIANS AND PARK  MANAGERS 
19:15:03 SHOULD TAKE A BALANCED APPROACH THAT CONSIDERS REGIONAL VISITORS NOT JUST NEIGHBOR COMPLAINTS.

19:15:14 THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
AT THIS TIME, WE'LL RETURN TO OUR --

19:15:18 >> Ms. Gauthier: SURESH WAS ONE OF THE OTHER SPEAKERS.
>> Mayor Mei: IS HE STILL THERE?

19:15:26 I DON'T SEE THE -- SURESH?
>> YES, I'M HERE.
I WAS WAITING FOR THE UNMUTE TO 
19:15:31 OCCUR.
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY, THANK YOU.
>> I JUST WANT TO AMPLIFY AND PICK UP 
19:15:38 SOMETHING THAT KELLY SAID, AND I WOULD FOCUS ON THE SABERCAT TRAIL BECAUSE THAT WAS COMPLETELY A CITY DEVELOPMENT 
19:15:47 ON WHICH I DO NOT KNOW THE NUMBERS BUT SOMEWHERE IN EXCESS OF 5 MILLION, I THINK, IS SPENT AND IS A PLAN TO SPEND 
19:15:58 THE $20 MILLION WHEN THAT IS EXTENDED TO BUILD THE BRIDGE ACROSS THE 680.
AND THE CITY FOR WHATEVER REASON CHOSE 
19:16:04 TO BUILD A SMALL PARKING LOT OF 13 OR 12 CARS IN A RESTROOM.
WHICH I APPRECIATE.

19:16:11 ACCEPT THAT PARKING LOT IS HARDLY EVER USED.
AND THE OTHER ENTRANCES TO THAT TRAIL 
19:16:19 STARTING AT THE PINE STREET AND WHERE ALL PROPERTY OWNERS WHO OF COURSE ARE BENEFITED WITH THE APPRECIATION HAVE 
19:16:26 PUT UP SIGNS WHICH THEY THINK ARE LEGAL TO TELL PEOPLE NOT TO PARK IN FRONT OF THE HOUSES.

19:16:33 THEY BELIEVE THAT THE STREET IN FRONT OF THE HOUSES BELONGS TO THEM.
AND JUST TO AMPLIFY, THIS IS THE 
19:16:42 REVERSE ROBIN HOOD APPROACH.
COLLECT TAXES FROM THE LESS FORTUNATE FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE RICH AND THEY 
19:16:52 GET THE SPECIAL TREATMENT.
I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THIS WORKS, ALLS OF COURSE THEY DONATE TO 
19:16:54 VARIOUS POLITICIANS.
THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:17:04 SO AT THIS TIME, I WILL TURN IT BACK TO THE VOTE ON THIS ITEM, IF THERE'S ANY MOTION, PLEASE?

19:17:16 
>> Vice Mayor Shao: SO MOVED.

THE PUBLIC HEARING IS NOW OPEN.
WE WILL NOW HEAR FROM ANYONE WHO 
19:18:17 WISHES TO SPEAK ABOUT THE PROPOSED FINANCING.
AND DOES ANYONE WISH TO SPEAK ABOUT 
19:18:28 THE FINANCING?
OKAY.
MAY I ASK IF THERE WERE ANY WRITTEN 
19:18:34 COMMENTS ON THE PROPOSED TAX EXEMPT BONDS FOR THE PROJECT RECEIVED BY THE CLERK PRIOR TO THE HEARING?

19:18:41 >> Ms. Gauthier: NO, MADAME MAYOR.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
AS SUCH, THE PUBLIC HEARING IS NOW 
19:18:43 CLOSED.
ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COUNCIL?

19:18:57 SEEING NONE, CAN I ASK FOR AN ACTION TO ADOPT THE RESOLUTION APPROVING THE ISSUANCE OF MULTIFAMILY HOUSING 
19:19:02 REVENUE BONDS BY THE CALIFORNIA STATEWIDE COMMUNITIES  DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY?

>> HI.
I'M NOT SEEING THE ABILITY TO SHARE MY 
19:20:10 SCREEN.
IS THERE A PROMPT THAT I NEED?
>> Mayor Mei: IT WOULD BE ON ZOOM.

19:20:14 IT'S USUALLY -- DEPENDING ON THE LOCATION OF YOUR APPLICATION, IT'S USUALLY IN THE CENTER.

19:20:18 THERE IS AN OPTION THAT'S USUALLY HIGHLIGHTED WITH A GREEN ARROW ON THE BOTTOM.

19:20:21 >> I SEE IT.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
>> Mayor Mei: YOU'RE WELCOME.

19:20:33 >> OKAY.
GOOD EVENING MAYOR AND MEMBERS OF THE CITY COUNCIL.

19:20:40 THE ITEM BEFORE YOU FOR TONIGHT IS FOR CONSIDERATION OF AN APPLICANT FILED APPEAL OF THE PLANNING COMMISSION'S 
19:20:49  FEBRUARY 11TH, 2021 ACTION TO DENY A PROPOSAL TO REZONE AN UNDEVELOPED 6.84-ACRE SITE AT THE TERMINUS OF 
19:20:54 OMAHA WAY AND THE WARM SPRINGS NEIGHBORHOOD TO A PRELIMINARY AND PRECISE  PLANNED DISTRICT AND TO 
19:21:00 SUBDIVIDE THE SITE TO ACCOMMODATE A NEW 13-UNIT SINGLE-FAMILY HOME DEVELOPMENT.

19:21:04 BEFORE GETTING INTO THE PROJECT SPECIFICS, I WOULD LIKE TO PROVIDE SOME SETTING AND CONTEXT INFORMATION 
19:21:11 ABOUT THE PROJECT SITE.
THE SITE IS BOUNDED BY INTERSTATE 680 TO THE EAST, WARREN AVENUE TO THE 
19:21:16 NORTH, AND A RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD TO THE WEST AND SOUTH.
THIS ADJACENT NEIGHBORHOOD WAS 
19:21:21 DEVELOPED IN THE MID TO LATE 1970s AND IS COMPRISED OF ONE AND TWO-STORY SINGLE-FAMILY HOMES.

19:21:27 THE PROJECT SITE IS A REMAINDER SITE AND LIKE MOST IN THE CITY, IT HAS UNIQUE ASPECTS TO THAT PRESENT 
19:21:35 CHALLENGES FOR  DEVELOPMENT.
THE SITE FEATURES AN EAST-WEST SLOPE WITH SLOPES THAT ARE GENERALLY THE 
19:21:40 STEEPEST ON THE FREEWAY ADJACENT HALF.
THE TOTAL GRADE CHANGE FROM THE WESTERN EDGE OF THE SITE AND THE 
19:21:50 FREEWAY EDGE IS APPROXIMATELY 50 FEET AND THE SITE ALSO FEATURED A CREEK AND ITS ASSOCIATED RIPARIAN AREA.

19:21:58 LOW DENSITY RESIDENTIAL WHICH IS THE SAME DESIGNATION AS THE ADJACENT NEIGHBORHOOD.

19:22:12 OMAHA WAY WAS STUBBED AT THE WEST END OF THE PROJECT SITE IN ANTICIPATION OF A RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT AND THIS 
19:22:22 PROJECT  TIES INTO THAT STREET SEGMENT AS INTENDED.
THE SITE IS LOCATED WITHIN THE ALQUIST 
19:22:30 PRELLO FAULT.
THESE ARE IN RED ON THE PRESENTATION IMAGE.

19:22:36 SURROUNDING THE FAULT TRACES ARE AT 30-FOOT WIDE FAULT SETBACK ZONE RECOMMENDED BY THE  PROJECT'S 
19:22:40 GEOTECHNICAL ENGINEER.
THIS 30-FOOT AREA IS DEEMED UNSUITABLE FOR DEVELOPMENT OF STRUCTURES.

19:22:46 THE SITE ALSO FEATURES FOR DORMANT LANDSLIDES.
THESE LANDSLIDES WOULD BE ELIMINATED 
19:22:53 THROUGH  PROJECT-CREATING ACTIVITIES.
WITH THE FAULT SETBACK AREAS REMOVED FROM THE SITE, THE GROSS ACREAGE IS 
19:23:03 REDUCED TO A NET OF 4.53 ACRES.
THE PROPOSED SUBDIVISION WOULD CONSIST OF 13 INDIVIDUAL SINGLE-FAMILY HOME 
19:23:12 LOTS PLUS SIX COMMON PARCELS.
PROJECT LOTS WOULD MEASURE BETWEEN 8,740 SQUARE FEET AND 19,151 SQUARE 
19:23:18 FEET, AND EXTEND FROM THE PROJECT'S PRIVATE STREET, WHICH IS LOCATED WEST OF THE LOTS, TO THE EDGE OF THE 
19:23:24 CALTRANS PROPERTY ON THE EAST -- EAST OF THE SITE.
HOME PADS ARE PROPOSED IN LOCATIONS 
19:23:30 WEST OF THE FAULT  SETBACK ZONE.
LEAVING AREAS EAST OF THE HOMES FOR BACKYARDS AND BEYOND THAT, THE 
19:23:36 HILLSIDE OPEN SPACE EASEMENT THAT WOULD BE HYDROSEEDED AND PLANTED WITH TREES TO FORM AN ATTRACTIVE BACKDROP TO THE 
19:23:40 PROJECT.
THE HILLSIDE WOULD BE SEPARATED FROM THE USABLE PORTIONS OF RESIDENTIAL 
19:23:46 LOTS BY RETAINING WALLS AND VIEW VENS, DEPENDING ON THE LOT, AND WOULD BE ACCESSIBLE ONLY FOR MAINTENANCE 
19:23:52 PURPOSES WHICH WOULD BE OVERSEEN BY THE PROJECT'S HOA.
ACCESS TO PROJECT LOTS WOULD COME VIA 
19:24:02 A 27-FOOT-WIDE PRIVATE STREET THAT WOULD CONNECTOME HAW WAY.
IT ALLOWS FOREFRONT LOADED HOMES, 
19:24:07 THEREBY PROVIDING SIGNIFICANT SEPARATION BETWEEN THE NEW HOMES AND EXISTING HOMES LOCATED ADJACENT TO THE 
19:24:11 SITE.
THIS ORIENTATION ALSO REDUCES THE AMOUNT OF HILLSIDE CUTTING AND GRADING 
19:24:22 THAT WOULD BE NECESSARY.
A FOOT WIDE SIDEWALK WOULD BE LOCATED ON THE SIDE OF THE STREET WITH THE 
19:24:26 HOMES AND HAMMER HEADS ARE PROVIDED AT EACH STREET END FOR EMERGENCY VEHICLE TURNAROUND AREAS.

19:24:33 THE SUBDIVISION INCLUDES A COMMON USABLE OPEN SPACE AREA LOCATED IN THE CENTER OF THE PROJECT, WHERE THE FAULT 
19:24:47 ZONE EXTENDS FURTHEST INTO THE SITE.
THIS LOCATION MAXIMIZES THE CONVENE YENS OF THE OPEN SPACE AND DOWN INTO 
19:24:54 THE DEVELOPMENT.
THE 13 PROJECT HOMES WOULD RANGE BETWEEN 2,181 SQUARE FEET AND 3,106 
19:24:58 SQUARE FEET.
ALL HOMES WOULD CONTAIN FOUR BEDROOMS AND FEATURE AN ATTACHED 2 CAR GARAGE 
19:25:03 WITH DRIVEWAYS THAT CONNECT TO THE PRIVATE STREET.
THE APPLICANT HAS ELECTED TO REZONE 
19:25:08 THE SITE TO A PLANNED DISTRICT TO MAINTAIN A LEVEL OF DEVELOPMENT FLEXIBILITY BECAUSE OF THE SITE'S 
19:25:16 PHYSICAL CONSTRAINTS.
THE BASIS OF DEVELOPMENT IS THE R-1-6 ZONE, THE SAME AS THE ADJACENT 
19:25:21 NEIGHBORHOOD IN A DISTRICT THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH THE LOW DENSITY DESIGNATION OF THE SITE.

19:25:28 THE PROJECT IS CONSISTENT WITH THE R-1-6 STANDARDS EXCEPT FOR A PORTION OF PROJECT LOTS THAT WOULD HAVEWITZ 
19:25:33 AND SETBACKS LESS THAN THE DISTRICT STANDARD.
LOTS WITH SUBSTANDARDWITZ NUMBER SIX 
19:25:41 IN TOTAL AND ARE LOCATED ON THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE  PROJECT, WHERE POSITIONING OF THE SERVICE VEHICLE 
19:25:45 TURNAROUND AREA AND AVOIDANCE OF THE RIPARIAN AREA PUSH DEVELOPMENT SOUTHWARD.

19:25:52 LOTS WITH SUBSTANDARD FRONT YARD DEPTHS ALSO NUMBER SIX IN TOTAL LOCATED PRIMARILY ON THE  PROJECT'S SOUTHERN 
19:25:58 HALF OR THE WESTWARD ENCROACHMENT ZONE IS GREATEST.
STAFF HAS FOUND THAT THESE LIMITED 
19:26:03 EXCEPTIONS TO THE  R-1-6 DISTRICT STANDARDS PROVIDE FOR OPTIMAL SITE DESIGN AND A PROJECT THAT WORKS WITHIN 
19:26:10 THE SITE'S CONSTRAINTS.
ADDITIONALLY, THESE LIMITED EXCEPTIONS TO THE R-1-6 DISTRICT STANDARDS ARE 
19:26:15 CONSISTENT WITH THE CITY'S SMALL LOT DESIGN GUIDELINES, WHICH ARE APPLICABLE TO LOTS GENERALLY BETWEEN 
19:26:22 4,000 AND 6,000 SQUARE FEET, WHICH CORRESPONDS TO USABLE LOT AREA OF THE MAJORITY OF PROJECT LOTS.

19:26:30 THE PROJECT FEATURES TWO PRIMARY HOME TYPES:  A STANDARD  TWO-STORY HOME WITH LIVING SPACE ON FLOORS ONE AND 
19:26:35 TWO AS SEEN ON THE SCREEN HERE, AND A  SPLIT-LEVEL HOME THAT STEPS WITH THE SLOPE OF THE SITE, WHICH I'LL SHOW OWN 
19:26:42  ON THE NEXT SLIDE.
THIS TWO LEVEL PLAN TYPE IS FEATURED ON THE PROJECT'S WIDER LOTS.

19:26:50 ALL PLAN TYPES FEATURE HIGH QUALITY ARCHITECTURE OF CONTEMPORARY CRAFTSMAN AND FARMHOUSE ESTHETIC WITH  
19:26:53 TREATMENTS THAT WORK INDIVIDUALLY FOR EACH HOME AND CONTRIBUTE TO THE PROJECT AS A WHOLE.

19:26:58 HOMES HAVE ALSO BEEN FOUND TO COMPLY WITH ALL APPLICABLE RULES OF THE CITYWIDE DESIGN GUIDELINES.

19:27:05 THIS SECOND HOME TYPE IS A SPLIT LEVEL HOME FEATURING A STREET LEVEL GARAGE AND STORAGE AREA, AND TWO LEVELS OF 
19:27:11 LIVING SPACE ABOVE.
THE HOME IS DESIGNED TO STEP WITH THE SLOPE, REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF GRADING 
19:27:16 THAT WOULD BE NECESSARY.
THE SECOND FLOOR OF LIVING SPACE OF THIS HOME TYPE IS TUCKED UNDER THE 
19:27:21 ROOF LINE TO REDUCE THE PERCEIVED MASSING.
AS IT STEPS WITH THE SLOPE, THE HOME 
19:27:29 MAINTAINS A TWO-STORY PROFILE.
THESE HOMES, AS WELL AS THE  TWO-STORY HOME TYPE FEATURED ON THE PREVIOUS 
19:27:34 SLIDE ALSO MEASURE BELOW AS MEASURED FROM THE AVERAGE GRADE OF THEIR VARIOUS FOUNDATION LEVELS TO THE 
19:27:42 MIDPOINTS OF THEIR ROOF SLOPES.
IN ACCORDANCE WITH STATE LAW, WE DID AN ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS OF THE 
19:27:48 PROJECT.
THAT ANALYSIS COVERED ALL REQUIRED CEQA DISCUSSION AREAS AND WAS INFORMED 
19:27:53 BY NUMEROUS TECHNICAL STUDIES OFFERED BY EXPERTS IN THEIR FIELD PLUS MULTIPLE ROUNDS OF CITY COMMISSION 
19:27:57 PEER REVIEW OF SITE GEOTECHNICAL STUDIES.
THE INITIAL STUDY CONCLUDED THAT 
19:28:05 POTENTIALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS TO AIR QUALITY, GEOLOGY, SOILS AND SEISMICITY AND GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS WITH I 
19:28:14 STEM FROM THE PROJECT UNLESS EMISSION WAS INCORPORATED.
LEVELS LESS THAN SIGNIFICANT HAVE BEEN 
19:28:20 IDENTIFIED AND AS CONDITIONS OF APPROVAL.
THE INITIAL STUDY AND NEGATIVE 
19:28:25 MITIGATED DECLARATION WERE  POSTED LAST SEPTEMBER AND AT THE TAIL END OF THE PUBLIC REVIEW PERIOD, A LETTER WAS 
19:28:31 RECEIVED FROM GREENFIRE LAW ON BEHALF OF SAVE OMAHA WAY HILLS CHALLENGING MANY OF THE FINDINGS IN THE INITIAL 
19:28:35 STUDY AND THE APPROPRIATENESS OF A MITIGATED NEGATIVE DECLARATION FOR  PROJECT.

19:28:43 THE APPLICANT AND CITY STAFF REVIEWED THE SAVE OMAHA WAY HILLS LETTER AND ISSUED A RESPONSE LETTER FILED ON THE 
19:28:49 APPLICANT'S BEHALF.
THE RESPONSE LETTER WAS INFORMED BY SUPPLEMENTAL TECHNICAL ANALYSIS 
19:28:54 PREPARED BY THE APPLICANT'S CONSULTANT, AND REAFFIRMS THAT PROJECT IMPACTS WOULD BE MITIGATED TO A LEVEL LESS 
19:29:01 THAN SIGNIFICANCE IN ACCORDANCE WITH CEQA.
STAFF BELIEVES NO NEW EVIDENCE HAS 
19:29:06 BEEN PRESENTED WARRANTING A DIGSAL ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW, AND ACCORDINGLY, WE RECOMMEND THAT THE PROPOSED 
19:29:12 MITIGATED NEGATIVE DECLARATION WHICH WAS PREPARED PURSUANT TO CEQA AND BEFORE YOU FOR CONSIDERATION IS 
19:29:20 COMPLETE AND ADEQUATE FOR THE APPLICANT'S PROJECT.
ON FEBRUARY 11TH, THE PLANNING 
19:29:24 COMMISSION HELD A PUBLIC HEARING TO CONSIDER THE PROJECT.
NINE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC  SPOKE.

19:29:28 SEVEN WERE IN OPPOSITION TO THE PROJECT AND TWO WERE IN FAVOR OF ITS APPROVAL.

19:29:34 THOSE SPEAKING IN OPPOSITION TO THE PROJECT RAISED CONCERNS RELATED TO THE POTENTIAL IMPACTS OF DEVELOPMENT 
19:29:39 ACTIVITY IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO THE FAULTS AND IN PROXIMITY TO NEIGHBORING HOMES.

19:29:46 THE EXTENT OF GRADING AND HILLSIDE CUTS, THE NEED FOR A PROJECT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT, THE 
19:29:55 POTENTIAL LOSS OF VIEWS OF MISSION HILLS AND THE SIZE AND HEIGHT OF PROPOSED HOMES AND NEIGHBORHOOD 
19:30:00 TRAFFIC CONGESTION.
THOSE IN SUPPORT OF THE PROJECT SPOKE ABOUT THE BENEFITS OF INCREASING 
19:30:05 HOUSING STOCK IN THE AREA, ELIMINATION OF FIRE  HAZARDS POSED BY THE UNDEVELOPED HILLSIDE, AND THE QUALITY 
19:30:12 OF HOME DESIGNS.
FLEURNL CONCERNS RAIDED BY THE PLANNING COMMISSIONERS INCLUDED NOISE 
19:30:17 AND TOXIC AIR CONTAMINANT EXPOSURE TO THE FUTURE OCCUPANTS OF THE PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT, AS WELL AS A RELUCTANCE 
19:30:24 TO SUPPORT THE REQUESTED LIMITED  SUGGESTIONS TO THE  R-1-6 STANDARDS BECAUSE THEY WOULD CONSIDER TO NOISE 
19:30:29 AND AIR QUALITY EXPOSURE.
AFTER RECEIVING TESTIMONY FROM STAFF, THE APPLICANT AND THE APPLICANT'S 
19:30:34 CONSULTANTS AND THEIR LEGAL ADVISOR, THE  PLANNING COMMISSION PASSED THE MOTION TO DENY THE PROJECT 6-1.

19:30:43 THE ONE DISSENTING PLANNING COMMISSIONER CITED SEVERAL EXAMPLES OF SIMILAR SINGLE-FAMILY DEVELOPMENTS 
19:30:54 BUILT WITHIN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO I-680.
FOLLOWING THE HEARING, THE APPLICANT FILED A QUALIFYING APPEAL WITHIN THE 
19:30:58 10-DAY APPEAL WINDOW.
NO CHANGES OF THE PROJECT HAVE BEEN MADE SINCE THE PLANNING COMMISSION 
19:31:05 HEARING.
STAFF STANDS BY THEIR ORIGINAL RECOMMENDATION TO APPROVE THE 
19:31:09 PROJECT.
WHAT'S BEING PRESENTED AND THE APPLICANT AND HIS CONSULTANTS CAN 
19:31:15 SPEAK TO THIS IN FINER DETAIL, IS A PROJECT THAT'S BORNE OUT OF EXTENSIVE STUDY AND ONE THAT'S DESIGNED TO 
19:31:21 CONTEXTUALLY FIT WITHIN BOTH THE SITE AND ITS SURROUNDINGS.
POTENTIAL PROJECT IMPACTS TO THE 
19:31:26 ENVIRONMENT INCLUDING THE OCCUPANTS OF NEIGHBORING HOMES HAVE BEEN MITIGATED PER EVIDENCE IN THE RECORD TO LEVELS 
19:31:32 LESS THAN SIGNIFICANT.
ADDITIONALLY, IMPACT OF THE ENVIRONMENT ON THE PROPOSED PROJECT IN 
19:31:38 FUTURE PROJECT RESIDENTS HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED BY THE INCLUSION OF HOME FEATURES SUCH AS CALIFORNIA ROOMS AND 
19:31:44 STC RATED WINDOWS AND DOORS TO DEAL WITH FREEWAY NOISE, AND AIR FILTRATION UNITS WITHIN THE HOMES TO ENSURE 
19:31:48 HEALTHY INDOOR AIR QUALITY LEVELS CONSISTENT WITH GENERAL PLAN THRESHOLDS.

19:31:57 FURTHERMORE, THE PROJECT IS IMPLEMENTING THE GENERAL PLAN AND ZONING -- FOR OVER 40 YEARS AND IS 
19:32:03 DOING SO IN A CONTEXTUAL LISTENSTIVE MANNER WHICH THE APPLICANT BELIEVES HAS BEEN DESIGNED TO MINIMIZE 
19:32:09 IMPACTS.
WHAT'S PROPOSED IS A 13-UNIT PROJECT THAT'S EQUAL TO ROUGHLY THREE UNITS 
19:32:18 PER NET ACRE, WHICH IS AT THE LOWER END OF THE PERMITTED DENSITY RANGE OF THE SITE, WHICH ALLOWS UP TO 8.7 UNITS PER 
19:32:25 DWELLING ACRE.
WITH A NET ACREAGE OF APPROXIMATELY 4 1/2 ACRES, UP TO 39 UNITS COULD 
19:32:31 POTENTIALLY BE ALLOWED UNDER ITS CURRENT DESIGNATION OF LOW DENSITY RESIDENTIAL IN ACCORDANCE WITH STATE 
19:32:36 LAW.
UNDER THE RECENTLY ENACTED HOUSING CRISIS ACT, THE CITY'S ABILITY TO DENY 
19:32:43 HOUSING  DEVELOPMENT ON THIS SITE HAS BEEN CURTAILED.
AB330, WHICH IS EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1ST, 
19:32:49 2020 THROUGH JANUARY 1ST, 2025, SPECIFIES THE CITY MUST APPLY OBJECTIVE STANDARDS AND CRITERIA TO 
19:32:54 FACILITATE AND ACCOMMODATE DEVELOPMENT AT THE DENSITY ALLOWED ON THE SITE BY THE GENERAL PLAN.

19:33:02 AS MENTIONED A MOMENT AGO, THE GENERAL PLAN PRESCRIBES A MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE DENSITY OF UP TO 8.7 UNITS PER NET 
19:33:08 ACRE ON THE SITE, WHICH WOULD EQUATE TO POTENTIALLY 39 UNITS.
THE PROJECT BEFORE YOU, HOWEVER, IS 
19:33:17 NOT ENTIRELY CONSISTENT WITH OBJECTIVE STANDARDS BECAUSE OF THE MINOR DEEF YAILINGSES TO  R-1-6 LOT SET BACK AND 
19:33:20 WIDTH STANDARDS.
IT IS THEREFORE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR SB330.

19:33:28 HOWEVER, AN OBJECTIVELY COMPLIANT RESIDENTIAL PROJECT AT THE SITE COULD USE SB330 AT AN APPROVAL TOOL AND THAT 
19:33:34 PROJECT COULD POTENTIALLY INCLUDE UP TO 39 UNITS.
A LARGER PROJECT WOULD LIKELY BE LESS 
19:33:41 CONTEXTUAL AND LESS COMPATIBLE TO THE SAT SEAT AND SURROUNDINGS THAN THE CURRENT AND PUT PEOPLE CLOSER TO 
19:33:45 NEIGHBORING HOMES AND ALSO THE FREEWAY.
SO WHILE THE PROPOSED PROJECT MAY NOT 
19:33:50 QUALIFY FOR SB330 BECAUSE OF THE TWO MINOR DEVIATIONS PROPOSED, IT'S VIEWED BY THE CITY AS A SUPERVISOR OR PROJECT 
19:33:56 TO WHAT POTENTIALLY COULD BE DEVELOPED AT THE SITE WITH AN OBJECTIVELY COMPLIANT  SB330 PROJECT.

19:34:05 STAFF'S RECOMMENDATION IS THAT THE CITY COUNCIL ADOPT THE PROPOSED MITIGATED NEGATIVE DECLARATION PREPARED PURSUANT 
19:34:11 TO CEQA, FINDING THAT IT IS COMPLETE AND ADEQUATE FOR THE PROPOSED PROJECT, ADOPT THE RESOLUTION GRANTING THE 
19:34:16 APPEAL, AND APPROVE THE PROJECT IN ITS VARIOUS ENTITLEMENTS, INCLUDING AN ORDINANCE REZONING THE SITE TO A 
19:34:24 PRELIMINARY AND PRECISE PLANNED DISTRICT, P-2018-192.
THAT CONCLUDES STAFF'S PRESENTATION.

19:34:33 I'M AVAILABLE FOR ANY QUESTIONS.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU, MARK.
AT THIS TIME, I'LL TURN IT OVER TO OUR 
19:34:36 COUNCIL FOR ANY  CLARIFYING QUESTIONS.
WE'LL BEGIN WITH COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN.

19:34:45 >> Councilmember Kassan: THANK YOU.
I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT THE NOISE ISSUE.

19:35:03 SO MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT TO BE CONSISTENT WITH THE GENERAL PLAN, THE NOISE LEVEL SHOULD BE IDEALLY BELOW 
19:35:12 60-DECIBELS.
AND DEFINITELY BELOW 65.
AND I UNDERSTAND THAT TWO OF THE LOTS 
19:35:21 WOULD EXCEED 65, AND THERE'S A PROPOSED MITIGATION OF ADDING CALIFORNIA ROOMS, WHICH ARE SORT OF INDOOR/OUTDOOR  
19:35:26 ROOMS.
BUT I DIDN'T SEE -- AND I'M SORRY IF I MISSED THIS IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL 
19:35:33 REPORT, BUT WITHOUT THE CALIFORNIA ROOMS, WHAT IS THE NOISE LEVEL ON THOSE TWO LOTS?

19:35:41 IT SAYS IT'S ABOVE 65 DECIBELS.
WHAT IS THE NOISE LEVEL,  ASSUMING SOMEONE WANTS TO GO OUTSIDE OF THE 
19:35:50 CALIFORNIA ROOM?
>> LET ME GET THAT FIGURE FOR YOU.
JUST ONE MOMENT, PLEASE.

19:36:22 >> Mayor Mei: ALTERNATIVELY WE COULD GET BACK --
>> I'M SORRY, I HAVE THE DATA HERE.

19:36:32 SO THE INTRODUCTION OF THE CALIFORNIA ROOM TO LOTS 1 AND 2 OR THE HOMES ON LOTS 1 AND 2 WOULD REDUCE THE NOISE 
19:36:42 LEVELS BY APPROXIMATELY 5 TO 8 D/B/A FROM BACKYARD CONDITIONS.
SO THAT WOULD BE FROM 65 AND 68 WOULD 
19:36:48 BE THE READINGS ON THOSE TWO PROPERTIES WITHOUT THE CALIFORNIA ROOMS.
>> Councilmember Kassan: THANK YOU.

19:36:57 >> Mayor Mei: OKAY.
SEEING NO OTHER CLARIFYING QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME, WE'RE GOING TO TURN IT 
19:37:15 OVER TO HAYES  SHAIR OF THE ENVISUALITY GROUP, WHO WILL PROVIDE A PRESENTATION.

19:37:19 >> THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR AND MEMBERS OF CITY COUNCIL FOR CONSIDERING OUR APPEAL.

19:37:26 I'M GOING TO TURN IT OVER TO OUR ATTORNEY TO KICK IT OFF, ALICIA GUERRA.

19:37:30 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
>> THANK YOU, HAYES.
THANK YOU, MAYOR MEI, MEMBERS OF THE 
19:37:38 CITY COUNCIL.
JUST REALLY QUICKLY, I'D LIKE TO EXPLAIN, WE SUBMITTED THE APPEAL ON 
19:37:46 BEHALF OF OMAHA FREMONT TO SEEKING THE COUNCIL'S DETERMINATION TO OVERTURN THE PLANNING COMMISSION'S DENIAL OF 
19:37:51 THE APPROVAL ON -- OR -- ON FEBRUARY 11TH.
AND THE REASON FOR THAT WAS TWOFOLD.

19:38:00 ONE WAS THE DETERMINATION TO DENY A HOUSING PROJECT CONSISTENT WITH THE GENERAL PLAN AND ZONING WAS IMPROPER 
19:38:06 AS A MATTER OF STATE LAW.
AND THEN SECONDLY, I WANTED TO FOCUS ON THE CEQA ISSUES THAT ARE AT HAND.

19:38:14 THE CITY CONDUCTED AN EXTENSIVE INITIAL STUDY MITIGATED NEGATIVE DECLARATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH CEQA AS MR. 
19:38:18 HUNGERFORD MENTIONED TO YOU IN HIS PRESENTATION.
WHAT'S IMPORTANT ABOUT THAT IS THAT 
19:38:27 THAT ANALYSIS WAS BASED ON SUBSTANCHION EVIDENCE, ENOUGH RELEVANT INFORMATION AND MULTIPLE INFERENCES FROM THIS 
19:38:34 INFORMATION THAT CAN BE DRAWN THAT ARE REASONABLE THAT A FAIR ARGUMENT CAN BE MADE TO SUPPORT A CONCLUSION THAT 
19:38:38 PROJECT IS GOING TO HAVE A LESS THAN SIGNIFICANT IMPACT, EVEN IF SOMEBODY ELSE COULD PROPOSE A DIFFERENT 
19:38:44 CONCLUSION.
BUT ARGUMENT, SPEC LAI UNSUBSTANTIATED OPINION, EVIDENCE, PEOPLE'S FEELINGS 
19:38:50 DON'T COUNT AS SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE UNDER THE LAW, AND UNFORTUNATELY, THE PLANNING COMMISSION REJECTED THE 
19:38:57 INITIAL STUDY ATITY MEETING ON  FEBRUARY 11TH ON THE BASIS THAT THEY WERE KIND OF UNEASY ABOUT THIS 
19:39:01 PROJECT, GIVEN THE EXISTING CONDITIONS TO WHICH THIS PROJECT WOULD BE EX-POACTED.

19:39:11 WELL, THAT'S NOT A BASIS TO OVERTURN AN INITIAL STUDY MITIGATED NEG DEC.
THAT DOESN'T CONSTITUTE SUBSTANTIAL 
19:39:14 EVIDENCE.
WE HAVE ALL OF OUR EXPERTS HERE THIS EVENING TO ADDRESS ANY QUESTIONS YOU 
19:39:21 MAY HAVE REGARDING THE ADEQUACY OF THE ANALYSIS FROM AN INITIAL STUDY PERSPECTIVE TO SUPPORT HOW THE IMPACTS 
19:39:26 WERE MITIGATED TO A LESS THAN SIGNIFICANT LEVEL.
THE COMMENTS THAT THE NEIGHBORS HAVE 
19:39:33 SUBMITTED, BOTH THOSE LAST YEAR AND THE RESTATED COMMENTS THAT THEY SUBMITTED YESTERDAY IN THEIR LETTER ARE ALL THE 
19:39:37 SAME.
THEY'RE ALL RELATED TO OTHER PROJECTS, THEY'RE ALL RELATED TO OTHER PEOPLE'S 
19:39:43 HOUSES.
THEY HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THE IMPACTS CAUSED BY THIS PROJECT, AND 
19:39:48 THOSE IMPACTS HAVE BEEN AVOIDED AND ALL IMPACTS HAVE BEEN MITIGATED TO A LESS THAN SIGNIFICANT LEVEL.

19:39:57 SO WE REQUEST THAT YOU OVERTURN THE PLANNING COMMISSION'S DENIAL AND APPROVE THE INITIAL STUDY MITIGATED 
19:40:05 NEGATIVE DECLARATION AND THE PROJECT.
AND WITH THAT, I'LL TURN IT OVER TO HAYEST TO WALK THROUGH THE MEASURES 
19:40:09 THAT HAVE BEEN INCORPORATED INTO THE PROJECT TO AVOID THE IMPACTS.
THANK YOU.

19:40:16 HAYES?
>> THANK YOU, ALICIA.
SO YES, AS MARK MENTIONED IN HIS VERY 
19:40:22 THOROUGH ANALYSIS, THE PROJECT IS A RESIDENTIAL COMMUNITY CONSISTING OF 13 SINGLE-FAMILY HOMES WHICH WE'RE 
19:40:26 GEARING TOWARDS MULTIGENERATIONAL FAMILIES.
WE'RE PROVIDING A ROBUST LANDSCAPING 
19:40:33 AND A CONSERVATION EASEMENT USING APPROXIMATELY 73 -- TREES AND USABLE OPEN SPACE THAT WILL AVAILABLE TO THE 
19:40:38 COMMUNITY USE.
THE PROJECT WILL BE ACCESSED BY A PRIVATE LANE RUNNING ALONG THE WESTERN 
19:40:44 PORTION OF THE PROPERTY WITH VEGETATIVE BUFFER AND STREET TREES.
SO DURING THE PLANNING COMMISSION 
19:40:50 DELIBERATION, ASIDE FROM THE LEGAL CONFLICTS THAT ALICIA HAD MENTIONED, THE COMMISSION'S DECISION ALSO 
19:40:54 PRESENTED SOME PRACTICALITY CHALLENGES.
THEY EXPRESSED AN UNEASINESS ABOUT THE 
19:41:00 PROJECT, WHICH STEMMED FROM TWO PRIMARY FACTORS WHICH WE WILL TRY TO ADDRESS IN SUCCESS SESSION.

19:41:07  SUCK SESSION.
THE FREEWAY PROXIMITY IS AN ISSUE OF THE PROPERTY LOCATION AND NOT OF THE 
19:41:13 PROJECT DESIGN, AND THE PROPERTY LOCATION IS ON A PARCEL FOR RESIDENTIAL  DEVELOPMENT.

19:41:19 THERE ARE MANY OTHER EXAMPLES OF RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT THAT ARE CLOSER TO THE FREEWAY AND WE'VE ALSO 
19:41:26 INVESTIGATED MULTIPLE SCENARIOS AND ARRIVED AT THE CURRENT PROPOSAL AT THE BEST SCENARIO THAT CAN BE PRACT BLI 
19:41:36   PRACTICABLELY ACHIEVED.
WE HAVE TAKEN -- CONDUCTED A LOT BY LOT COUNT OF ALL RESIDENTIAL HOMES 
19:41:41 FROM MILIPITAS ALL THE WAY TO THE SUNOL PASS ON THE NORTHERN CITY BOUNDARY THAT ARE CLOSE -- AS CLOSE OR CLOSER 
19:41:53 THAN 200 FEET FROM HIGHWAY 680.
THERE ARE 287 HOMES THAT ARE CLOSE OR CLOSER TO THE FREEWAY, AND OF THIS 
19:42:00 TOTAL, 90% HAVE BACKYARDS FACING THE HIGHWAY.
IN DOG OUR DESIGN PROCESS, WE DID RUN 
19:42:04 VARIOUS SCENARIOS TO CONSIDER ALTERNATIVES TO THE ACOUSTIC MED GAITION.

19:42:09 ONE WAS CONSTRUCTING SOUND WALLS BETWEEN 6 AND 14 FEET ALONG HIGHWAY 680.

19:42:16 UPON CONSULTATION WITH STAFF, WE DECIDED THAT A SOUND WALL WOULD HAVE MARGINAL REDUCTIONS AND WOULD ALSO 
19:42:21 SEVERELY IMPACT VIEW FROM HIGHWAY 680, PLUS IT ALSO LOOKED DOWN UPON IN THE GENERAL PLAN.

19:42:29 ALTERNATIVELY, WE ANALYZED THE SCENARIO WHERE WE FLIPPED TO CREATE A BUFFERED REAR YARD SCENARIO, THE HOMES 
19:42:34 THEMSELVES CREATE A BIT OF BUFFERING WITH OPEN SPACE BEHIND IT.
THE RESULT WOULD BE MASSIVE RETAINING 
19:42:41 WALLS, UTILITIES CROSSING A FAULT TRACE, INCREASED -- QUANTITIES AND PROJECT BACKYARDS WOULD BE  PUSHED 
19:42:48 ADJACENT TO OUR  NEIGHBORS.
THE CURRENT PROPOSAL WITH THE VEGETATIVE BUFFER OF TREES WITH A SEMI 
19:42:53 ENCLOSED CALIFORNIA ROOMS AT THE TWO MOST EXTREME LOT ONLY.
SO THE CONCERNS REGARDING THE 
19:43:01 DEVIATIONS FROM P STANDARDS FROM THE R-1-6 STANDARDS, THE PROPERTY WAS ALREADY CURRENTLY ZONED AS A PLANNED 
19:43:06 DISTRICT AND THUS FLEXIBILITY WAS ENVISIONED FROM THE BEGINNING.
THE DEVIATIONS FURTHERMORE ACCORDING 
19:43:12 TO THE FREMONT MUNICIPAL CODE DEVIATIONS FROM THE UNDERLYING STANDARDS MAY BE APPROVED WHEN THEY 
19:43:16 ENCOURAGE A DESIRABLE LIVING ENVIRONMENT AND ARE WARRANTED BY THE DESIGN AND AMENITIES INCORPORATED IN 
19:43:22 THE PRECISE PLAN OR PROVIDED TO THE COMMUNITY AT LARGE.
WE WILL DISCUSS THESE PROPOSED 
19:43:26 DEVIATIONS AND PROVIDE ADDITIONAL DETAILS ON HOW THE PROPOSED PROJECT RESULTS IN A SUPERIOR PRODUCT.

19:43:39 TO TALK ABOUT THE VARIOUS DEVIATIONS, THE FIRST ARE THE REDUCED LOT WIDTHS FOR THE FIRST SIX LOTS AND THIS ALLOWS 
19:43:44 US TO CLUSTER THE UNITS AWAY FROM SENSITIVE RIPARIAN AREAS BUT ALSO TO CREATE A LARGER CENTRAL OPEN SPACE 
19:43:50 WHICH WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR NEIGHBORHOOD USE.
ALTHOUGH THE NARROWEST LOTS ARE 52 
19:43:57 FEET WIDE, WHEN YOU AVERAGE OUT THE ENTIRE PROJECT, WE HAVE A 63-FOOT AVERAGE WIDTH, AND FOR BASIS OF 
19:44:06 COMPARISON, THE  COMPARABLE R-1-6 STANDARD IS A 55 FOOD LOT WIDTH.
DEVIATIONS FROM THE SETBACKS ARE THE 
19:44:15 FLAT AND WIDER UNITS, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12 AND 13.
THEY HAVE A MORE CONSTRAINED BUILDING 
19:44:23 ENVELOPE BECAUSE OF THE FAULT TRACE BEHIND THEM AND THUS WE'RE -- STILL CONSISTENT WITH THE SMALL LOT 
19:44:27 GUIDELINES.
THERE IS A COMPARABLE ZONING IN FREMONT THAT USES THIS PARTICULAR 
19:44:39 GUIDELINE.
GREATER GARAGE SET BACK FROM  THE -- THE HOMES ARE DESIGNED TO STEP INTO 
19:44:47 THE HILLSIDE TO MINIMIZE THE PERCEPTION OF HIETD AND IT MAINTAINS A MAXIMUM 2 STORY EXPRESSION AT ANY POINT IN THE 
19:44:52 ELEVATION.
THE LARGE ROADWAY CREATES A LARGE SEPARATION AND THE BUILDING TO 
19:44:58 BUILDING DISTANCE IS ABOUT THE SAME AS WHAT IS FOUND ACROSS YUCATAN DRIVE.
THE PRIVACY-SENSITIVE AREAS OF OUR 
19:45:04 PROJECT ARE CONFIGURED TOWARDS THE REAR OF OUR HOMES TO MINIMIZE PRIVACY IMPACTS TO OUR NEIGHBORS.

19:45:12 THE ARCHITECTURAL CHARACTER IS DESCRIBED AS CONTEMPORARY CRAFT MAN OR RANCH AND MAIN TAKES A TWO STORY 
19:45:16 EXPRESSION WITH A LOT OF ROOF LINE VARIATION AND THE DESIGN WAS DESIGNED WITH THE SINGLE-FAMILY DESIGN 
19:45:23 GUIDELINES IN MIND.
OVERALL THE PROJECT WAS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE A LARGE AMOUNT OF VARIETY WITH 
19:45:30 HIGH QUALITY MATERIAL AND DETAILING CONSISTENT TO THOSE STYLES.
WE PROPOSED A VERY LARGE LANDSCAPING 
19:45:34 PLAN BEHIND THE  HOMES SWELL IMPROVED OPEN SPACE FOR PASSIVE USE ACTIVITIES.

19:45:41 THE NEIGHBORHOOD SENSITIVITY, PARTICULARLY THE TOP OF RIDGES AS SEEN FROM YUCATAN DRIVE, WAS ALSO A 
19:45:49 DRIVE-IN CONSIDERATION IN ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN.
FINALLY, THE APPLICANT HAS 
19:45:54 DEMONSTRATED WITH PEER REVIEWED EVIDENCE THAT ALL PROJECT IMPACTS ARE CONTAINED ON SITE AND THE FINAL BUILT 
19:45:58 CONDITIONS REPRESENTS A MUCH MORE STABLE HILLSIDE THAN CURRENTLY EXISTS.

19:46:11 WE'RE CREATING A HILLSIDE WITH REINFORCED CONCRETE, RETAINING WALLS, PAVED FLAT WORM AND ENGINEERED 
19:46:14 STORMWATER CONTROL MEASURES.
WE HOPE WE CAN ADDRESS SOME OF THESE CONCERNS BY A THOROUGH DISCUSSION OF 
19:46:20 THE  CONSTRUCTION-STAGE MEASURES WE WILL BE IMPLEMENTING.
FIRST OF ALL, WE WILL BE USING LICENSE 
19:46:26 AND BONDED CONTRACTORS FOR ALL CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITY, INCLUDING ROUGH EX AND DIRT REMOVAL PROCEDURES.

19:46:31 WE'RE GOING TO REQUIRE PERFORMANCE BONDS AND REQUIRE THAT ALL OUR SUBS ARE COVERED UNDER A GENERAL LIABILITY 
19:46:35 INSURANCE.
THE SOIL CONDITIONS WILL BE ASSESSED IN THE FIELD BY OUR GEOTECHS, PRIOR TO 
19:46:41 ANY ROUGH CUTS.
ANGLE OF REPOSE OF ANY CUT SLOPES WILL BE EVALUATED BY THOSE SAME 
19:46:46 GEOTECHNICAL ENGINEERS.
WE'LL BE PROVIDING TEMPORARY SHORING CONSISTENT WITH OSHA REQUIREMENTS.

19:46:53 AS PART OF THE ACOUSTIC, WE WILL USE HOE EMISSION HAULING EQUIPMENT AND HAVE A PROTOCOL IN PLACE FOR TRUCKS TO 
19:46:58 CUT ENGINES WHILE IDLING TIMES AND SILENCING THEIR BACKUP ALARMS.
FURTHERMORE, THERE WILL BE NO PILE 
19:47:04 DRIVING, BLASTING OR USE OF ANY EQUIPMENT THAT WILL RESULT IN ANY VIBRATIONAL IMPACTS TO ANY SURROUNDING 
19:47:09 HOMES.
OUR GRADING ACTIVITIES ARE ANTICIPATED TO LAST APPROXIMATELY 40 WORKING DAYS, 
19:47:14 AND THE DEVELOPMENT TEAM THUS FAR HAS BEEN EXTREMELY RESPONSIVE TO OUR NEIGHBORHOOD CONCERNS FOR MAINTENANCE 
19:47:19 THROUGH THE YEARS, ESPECIALLY DURING HIGH WINDS.
WE'VE REPAIRED MULTIPLE GOOD NEIGHBOR 
19:47:29 FENCES AT NO COST TO THAT HOMEOWNER AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO RUN OUR OPERATION WITH A HIGH LEVEL OF RIGOR AND 
19:47:33 RESPECT.
WE ASK THE CITY COUNCIL GRANT OUR APPEAL REQUEST AND APPROVE THE INITIAL 
19:47:38 STUDY -- TENTATIVE MAP AND PRIVATE STREETS.
THANK YOU.

19:47:46 >> Mayor Mei: AT THIS TIME, I'LL TURN IT BACK TO THE COUNCIL FOR ANY CLARIFYING QUESTIONS OF THE 
19:47:55 DEVELOPER.
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN.
>> Councilmember Kassan: I DO HAVE A 
19:48:01 QUESTION BUT I DO ALSO WANT TO TAKE ISSUE WITH THE CHARACTERIZATION OF THE PLANNING COMMISSION'S, YOU KNOW, 
19:48:06 SAYING THAT IT WAS ARBITRARY OR BASED ON FEELINGS.
I THINK THERE WERE SOME VERY 
19:48:13 LEGITIMATE ISSUES RAISED, SO I HOPE THAT MAYBE THE APPLICANT WILL RETRACT SOME OF THOSE COMMENTS.

19:48:29 BUT MY QUESTION IS REGARDING THE ISSUES OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE GENERAL PLAN TO REJECT THE PLANNING COMMISSION'S 
19:48:35 DECISION, WE WOULD HAVE TO MAKE A FINDING THAT THIS PROJECT IS CONSISTENT WITH THE GENERAL PLAN, BUT 
19:48:46 MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE GENERAL PLAN DOES CALL FOR NOISE LEVELS THAT ARE LOWER THAN WHAT IS FOUND ON THESE 
19:48:51 LOTS.
I UNDERSTAND THERE ARE SOME PROPOSED MITIGATIONS BUT THOSE MITIGATIONS 
19:48:56 DON'T REALLY ADDRESS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN PEOPLE WANT TO GO OUTSIDE, EITHER THERE COULD BE CHILDREN LIVING ON 
19:49:03 THESE PROPERTIES, THAT DON'T WANT TO JUST STAY INSIDE ALL THE TIME THAT WANT TO GO OUTSIDE AND PLAY AND THE 
19:49:11 NOISE LEVELS ARE ALMOST 70 DECIBELS ON SOME OF THESE PARCELS.
SO I JUST WANT SOME CLARIFICATION ON 
19:49:17 HOW -- YOU KNOW, HOW THIS CAN BE FOUND TO COMPLIEL WITH THE GENERAL PLAN GIVEN THAT POLICY AROUND NOISE.

19:49:24 FOUND TO COMPLY.
>> THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION, COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN.

19:49:30 WE DO HAVE A NOISE CONSULTANT, MICHAEL TILL, HERE TO ANSWER ANY SPECIFIC QUESTIONS IN REGARDS TO NOISE.

19:49:38 IN REGARDS TO THE COMPLIANCE WITH THE GENERAL PLAN, THE GENERAL PLAN DOES STIPULATE THAT PROJECTS CAN BE 
19:49:44 APPROVED WITHIN A CONDITIONALLY ACCEPTABLE RANGE OF 65 DECIBELS AND THAT IS WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING.

19:49:49 WE CAN ACHIEVE THIS USING A SOUND WALL.
AGAIN, THAT COULD BE ONE REALISTIC 
19:49:52 MITIGATION MEASURE THAT WOULD BE IMPLEMENTED.
WE NEVER REALLY DISCUSSED THIS OPTION 
19:50:00 AT THE PLANNING COMMISSION TO BE HONEST, BUT WE FELT THAT OF THE TRADEOFFS THAT WE HAD TO MAKE IN 
19:50:05 DEVELOPING THE SITE, THAT IT WOULD BE BETTER SERVED WITH A MORE VEGETATIVE BUFFER OF TREES AND THE CALIFORNIA 
19:50:11 ROOMS BECAUSE THOSE ARE ONLY -- THE LOTS THAT EXCEED ARE ONLY LIMITED TO TWO OF THEM.

19:50:19 SO IMPLEMENTING A SITE-SPECIFIC OR BUILDING-SPECIFIC SOLUTION SEEMED LIKE THE BEST POSSIBLE SOLUTION FROM THE 
19:50:28 DESIGN PERSPECTIVE.
MICHAEL, IF YOU'RE ON THE LINE, DO YOU HAVE ANY -- LET'S SEE.

19:50:32 >> YES, I'M HERE, HAYES.
CAN YOU HEAR ME?
>> Mayor Mei: YES.

19:50:40 >> GREAT.
SO YES, YOU'RE CORRECT, THE CITY'S GENERAL PLAN STANDARDS FOR 
19:50:47 SINGLE-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL LAND USES IS 60 D/B/A LDN.
THAT IS THEIR GOAL.

19:51:00 THERE IS AN ABILITY OF THE CITY COUNCIL TO PERMIT NOISE LEVELS UP TO 65LDN.
AFTER THE IMPLEMENTATION OF FEASIBLE 
19:51:10  MITIGATION.
SOL WHAT WE LOOKED AT WERE SOUND WALLS FIRST, AND HAVING A 14-FOOT BARRIER AT 
19:51:27 THE TOP OF THE SLOPE WOULD REDUCE THE NOISE LEVELS AT LOTS 2 THROUGH 13 TO BETWEEN 59 TO 62 DB LDN.

19:51:37 LOT 1 WOULD REMAIN AT 66.
ONE DB ABOVE THE THRESHOLD.
WHAT WE FOUND WITH THE SOUND WALLS WAS 
19:51:42 THAT IT WASN'T VERY EFFECTIVE BECAUSE THERE'S CONSIDERABLE SHIELDING THAT'S ALREADY PROVIDED BY THE SLOPE.

19:51:53 SO AN ALTERNATIVE WOULD BE TO CONSIDER THE CALIFORNIA ROOMS FOR THE TWO LOTS, LOTS 1 AND 2.

19:52:01 THIS TYPE OF MITIGATION HAS BEEN APPROVED ON OTHER PROJECTS.
ONE EXAMPLE I CAN THINK OF IS PALM 
19:52:16 AVENUE TO THE NORTH HERE.
THE 65 LDN GOAL IS NOT ABSOLUTE.
THERE ARE MANY PROPERTIES IN THE CITY 
19:52:23 OF FREMONT WHERE NOISE LEVELS ARE BEFORE 65 LDN.
THAT'S JUST A FACT WITH  DEVELOPMENT 
19:52:31 AS CLOSE AS IT IS NEXT TO THE FREEWAY.
THERE COULD BE PROPERTIES THAT ARE BEHIND FREEWAY SOUND WALLS THAT ARE 
19:52:44 EXPOSED TO NOISE LEVELS WELL ABOVE 65 LDN.
>> MAYBE IF I COULD JUST INTERJECT 
19:52:52 HERE, COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, YOU KNOW, WHEN THE CITY EVALUATES A PROJECT'S CONSISTENCY WITH THE GENERAL PLAN, IT 
19:52:59 LOOKS AT THE WHOLE THING IN TERMS OF AND LAND USE DESIGNATION, THE APPLICABLE POLICIES AND AS YOU POINT 
19:53:08 OUT, THE NOISE LEVELS BASED ON YOUR NOISE ELEMENT.
AND BECAUSE THE CITY HAS PLANNED THE 
19:53:12 SITE IN TERMS OF GENERAL PLAN AND ZONING FOR THE PAST 40 YEARS FOR RESIDENTIAL USE, WE LOOKED AT 
19:53:19 RESIDENTIAL USE CONSISTENT WITH THE GENERAL PLAN WHILE MEETING THE THRESHOLDS FOR WHAT WAS ACCEPTABLE FOR 
19:53:29 RESIDENTIAL USES UNDER YOUR NOISE ELEMENT POLICIES.
SO AS THERE THILL INDICATED, WE LOOKED 
19:53:34 AT MEASURES TO INCORPORATE INTO THE PROJECT IN ORDER TO AVOID AND SUBSTANTIALLY LESSEN THE ENVIRONMENTAL 
19:53:40 IMPACTS ASSOCIATED WITH EXPOSURE TO EXISTING CONDITIONS, IN LIGHT OF THE FACT THE CITY HAD ALREADY PLANNED THE 
19:53:46 SITE FOR RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT.
AND IN ALL INSTANCES, WITH THE CALIFORNIA ROOMS, INCLUDED IN THE 
19:53:53 DESIGN OF THE PROJECT, IT SUBSTANTIALLY LESSENS THE IMPACTS TO ACHIEVE CONSISTENCY WITH YOUR NOISE POLICIES.

19:54:04 WE RECOGNIZE THAT PEOPLE MAY PREFER TO GO OUT SIDE, BUT FOR THOSE FIRST LOTS, LOTS 1 AND 2, THEY HAVE THE OPTION OF 
19:54:11 BEING WITHIN A CALIFORNIA ROOM AS A DIFFERENT WAY FOR FEASIBLY IMPLEMENTING MITIGATION TO FURTHER 
19:54:15 LESSEN THE IMPACT.
SO THAT'S HOW WE DESIGNED THE PROJECT TO BE CONSISTENT WITH THE LAND USE 
19:54:19 DESIGNATION, THE GENERAL PLAN'S POLICIES, AND THE NOISE ELEMENT CONDITIONS.

19:54:31 >> Mayor Mei: I DO NOT SEE A FOLLOW-ON QUESTION.
I SEE A QUELL FROM VICE MAYOR SHAO.

19:54:38  SEE A QUESTION FROM VICE MAYOR SHAO.
>> Vice Mayor Shao: I JUST WONDER IF COMBINING WITH A SOUND WALL, YOU WOULD 
19:54:51 SWITCH THE SPACE BETWEEN THE STREET AND THE BACKYARD OF ALL THOSE UNITS.
WOULD THAT FURTHER RECUSE THE NOISE 
19:54:55 AND ALSO ENHANCE THE AIR QUALITY BECAUSE YOU'RE MOVING ALL THE UNITS FURTHER AWAY FROM THE HIGHWAY?

19:55:05 >> COUNCILMEMBER SHAO, THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION.
YES, WE HAVE ACTUALLY LOOKED INTO THAT 
19:55:13 OPTION ALTERNATIVE ALREADY, AND UNFORTUNATELY IT ACTUALLY PRESENTS GREATER IMPACTS AND -- YOU KNOW, YOU 
19:55:17 SOLVE ONE PROBLEM BUT YOU CREATE ANOTHER BASICALLY.
THE PROBLEM IS THAT IF WE WERE TO FLIP 
19:55:26 THE ROADWAY WITH THE BUILDINGS THEMSELVES, THE ROAD WOULD HAVE TO CLIMB UP A MUCH STEEPER GRADE AND WE'D 
19:55:34 HAVE TO CONSTRUCT MUCH SLEEPER RETAINING WALLS.
A BUILDING CAN STEP A LOT  FASTER, A 
19:55:42 LOT HIGHER THAN A ROADWAY SYSTEM.
SECOND, WE WOULD HAVE UTILITY LINES WITHIN THAT NEW ROADWAY, POTENTIALLY 
19:55:47 CROSSING THE FAULT TRACE, WHICH WE DO NOT WANT TO DESIGN IN THAT PARTICULAR WAY.

19:55:57 >> Mayor Mei: OKAY.
NEXT I ALSO HAVE COUNCILMEMBER JONES.
YOU HAVE CLARIFYING QUESTIONS?

19:56:03 >> Councilmember Jones: THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR.
REGARDING THE NOISE LEVEL ON LOTS 1 
19:56:09 AND 2, I KNOW THEY'RE SLIGHTLY ABOVE WHAT THE NOISE ORDINANCE IS REQUIRING.

19:56:19 HAS THERE BEEN ANY CONSIDERATION GIVEN TO EITHER INSTEAD OF OR IN ADDITION TO THE BOX TREES THAT YOU'RE PUTTING IN, 
19:56:29 BUILDING A SOUND BARRIER OF SOME TYPE JUST FOR THOSE TWO LOTS?
>> YES, ABSOLUTELY.

19:56:35 THAT'S ACTUALLY WHAT THE CALIFORNIA ROOM IS.
IT'S BASICALLY AN INDIVIDUALIZED 
19:56:44 ENCLOSURE THAT JUST IS UTILIZED AT THOSE TWO LOTS, BECAUSE THOSE ARE THE ONLY ONES THAT ARE DEFENDING.

19:56:50 SO TO CLARIFY WHAT THE CALIFORNIA ROOM PROPOSAL IS IS EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE DESCRIBING.

19:56:57 >> Councilmember Jones: WHAT ABOUT SOMETHING OUTSIDE TO ALLOW THE OCCUPANTS TO STILL MOVE THE YARD?

19:57:04 ARE THERE ANY MITIGATION MEASURES THAT CAN BE IMPLEMENTED THERE?
>> I SUPPOSE THAT ONE OF THE -- I'LL 
19:57:08 DEFER BUT I SUPPOSE THERE COULD BE A SOLUTION WITH A COMBINATION OF SOUND WALLS AND CALIFORNIA ROOMS.

19:57:16 YOU KNOW, AT COUNCIL'S PLEASURE, WE'D BE HAPPY TO CONSIDER THAT ALTERNATIVE.

19:57:22 AGAIN THAT'S THE REASON WHY WE HAVEN'T THUS FAR, IS MAINLY BECAUSE WE FOUND TO HAVE DIMINISHING RETURNS 
19:57:25 BASICALLY.
IN TERMS OF UNLESS WE GO TO A VERY HIGH WALL.

19:57:33 AND MAYBE MICHAEL CAN SPEAK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT.
>> THANK YOU, HAYES.

19:57:39 THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.
WE DID LOOK AT THE SOUND WALLS, PARTICULARLY FOR 1 AND 2, WHICH WERE 
19:57:49 THE MOST DIFFICULT TO MITIGATE.
WITH -- A 14 FOOT NOISE BARRIER BECAUSE OF THE AT THE RAIN  THERE, 
19:57:57 THAT LARGE BARRIER ONLY PROVIDES AN ADDITIONAL 2 DECIBELS OF NOISE REDUCTION AT LOT 1.

19:58:06 AND LOT 2, THAT NOISE BARRIER WOULD PROVIDE 4 DECIBELS OF NOISE REDUCTION.

19:58:13 SO WHEN YOU CONSIDER THE COST AND OTHER IMPACTS ASSOCIATED WITH BUILDING SUCH A LARGE SOUND WALL FOR SUCH A MINOR 
19:58:19 NOISE REDUCTION, THE BEST PLACE TO CONTROL THE NOISE IS AT THE RECEPTOR ITSELF.

19:58:28 CALTRANS HAS A POLICY THAT THEY WILL NOT BUILD A SOUND WALL UNLESS IT PROVIDES AT LEAST 7 DECIBELS OF NOISE 
19:58:36 REDUCTION AT ONE RECEPTOR.
SO IN THIS INSTANCE, THIS WOULD NOT CONSIDERED A FEASIBLE NOISE BARRIER.

19:58:43 >> Councilmember Jones: THANK YOU.
>> I WILL ADD ONE MORE THING TO THAT.
WE COULD POSSIBLY FEASIBLY EXPAND THE 
19:58:49 SIZE OF THE CALIFORNIA ROOM TO INCORPORATE MORE OF THE BACKYARD, TO PROVIDE A GREATER BACKYARD COVERAGE.

19:58:58 THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE COULD POTENTIALLY I IMPLEMENT.
>> Councilmember Jones: OKAY, THANK 
19:59:00 YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
CLARIFYING QUESTIONS?

19:59:04 COUNCILMEMBER COX.
>> Councilmember Cox: THANK YOU VERY MUCH, MAYOR.

19:59:13 I WANTED TO GET A LITTLE BIT MORE INFORMATION.
SINCE THESE HOMES ARE LOCATED NEAR 
19:59:22 680, THERE IS A LOT OF AIR POLLUTION THAT'S GOING ON BEING ASSOCIATED WITH THE 680 INTERCHANGE.

19:59:35 AND I NOTICE THAT YOU HAD  SELECTED A PARTICULAR VENT LITION FILTERRIZATION DEVICE THAT ONLY REMOVES ABOUT 80% OF 
19:59:43 THE POLLUTION, AND FOR ME PERSONALLY, I WOULD THINK THAT THERE WOULD BE ANOTHER -- LOOKING AT ANOTHER TYPE OF 
19:59:55 DEVICE THAT WOULD BE CLOSER TO THE 99.9% OF REMOVING THE AIR PARTICLES THAT CAN CAUSE CANCER OR RESPIRATORY 
20:00:05 ILLNESS, AND I'M VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THAT, AND USING THAT TYPE OF EQUIPMENT AS OPPOSED TO A HIGHER GRADE THAT 
20:00:13 WOULD REDUCE THE POLLUTION EVEN MORE.
COULD YOU PROVIDE WHATEVER YOUR JUSTIFICATION FOR SELECTING THIS 
20:00:24 VERSUS SOME OF THE OTHER ONES THAT WERE IN THE MARKET AND WHY THIS ONE?
>> THANK YOU, COUNCILMEMBER COX.

20:00:31 I'M GOING TO DEFLECT THIS -- DEFER THIS QUESTION TO JAMES  REIF, OUR AIR QUALITY CONSULTANT ON THE SELECTION OF 
20:00:38 THE EQUIPMENT.
>> YES, THANK YOU, HAYES.
THE REASON FOR SELECTING THIS TYPE OF 
20:00:44 VENTILATION SYSTEM IS THIS IS ONE THAT'S RECOMMENDED BY THE BAY AREA AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT AND THEIR 
20:00:52 PLANNING HEALTHY PLACES TYPE DOCUMENT.
IT'S ONE RECOMMENDED BY THE CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO, WHICH COMMONLY FACES 
20:01:00 THIS ISSUE.
IT IS A FEASIBLE AND REASONABLE METHOD TO REDUCE POLLUTION IN THESE TYPE OF 
20:01:10 ENVIRONMENTS.
IF WE GO -- MERV13 FILTRATION IS PRETTY EFFECTIVE.

20:01:17 IT'S VERY EFFECTIVE FOR THIS TYPE OF CONDITION.
AND IT IS -- IT'S A REASONABLE WAY -- 
20:01:25 THESE FILTERS ARE READILY AVAILABLE BECAUSE THE HOMEOWNERS HAVE TO MAINTAIN THIS SYSTEM.

20:01:35 SO IT CAN'T BE TOO ELABORATE WHERE IT'S EXPENSIVE TO OPERATE AND IT ALSO HAS TO -- I'M NOT AN EXPERT WITH TITLE 24 
20:01:41 BUILDING EFFICIENCY REQUIREMENTS, BUT THE VENTILATION SYSTEM CAN'T BE TOO EXPENSIVE TO OPERATE, WHICH IS LIKE A 
20:01:49 HOSPITAL GRADE, YOU KNOW, SURGERY ROOM-TYPE VENTILATION SYSTEM IS MUCH MORE ENERGY-IN10 SI. BUT THIS IS AN 
20:01:54 EFFECTIVE WAY AND OUR STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT, TO REDUCE AIR POLLUTION FROM THE FREEWAY.

20:02:00 >> Councilmember Cox: WHAT ABOUT THE HEALTH STUDIES?
WHAT DOES THAT REFLECT IN USING THIS 
20:02:13 PRODUCT?
>> WELL, THE ANALYSIS THAT WE DID, WHICH IS BASED ON HEALTH STUDIES THAT 
20:02:22 HAVE BEEN ADOPTED BY THE AIR DISTRICT SHOW THAT IT'S PARTICULATE MATTER FROM THE FREEWAYS THAT IS THE MAIN CAUSE OF 
20:02:30 HEALTH RISK.
AND THAT'S FINE PARTICULATE MATTER, AND IT'S DIESEL PARTICULATE MATTER 
20:02:36 FROM TRUCKS.
THAT'S WHAT THIS FILTRATION SYSTEM IS FOCUSED ON REDUCING.

20:02:46 IT WOULD REDUCE OTHER TYPES OF TOXICS BUT IT'S NOT DESIGNED THAT WAY, SO WE HAVE NO INFORMATION REGARDING HOW IT 
20:02:55 WOULD WORK FOR THAT, BUT WE DO KNOW -- SO WE DON'T TAKE THAT INTO CONSIDERATION WHEN DESCRIBING HOW THIS 
20:03:00 AFFECTS IT, BUT EVEN WITHOUT CONSIDERING THOSE EFFECTS, THE SYSTEM IS EFFECTIVE.

20:03:10  IN REDUCING HEALTH EFFECTS FROM THE FREEWAY.
KOCH COX THIS IS NOT ONLY FOR DIESEL 
20:03:21 THAT IT'S DOING THE FILTERING IT OUT THAT IT DOES NOT STATE ANY OTHER UNLEADED GAS THAT WOULD BE IN THE AIR, 
20:03:26 IT'S NOT TAKING THAT OUT?
IS THAT WHAT I'M HEARING?
CAN YOU CONFIRM THAT?

20:03:36 >> WELL, WE HAVE NO INFORMATION REGARDING THE EFFECTIVENESS, BUT IT HAS SOME EFFECT BECAUSE ALL OF THE AIR 
20:03:52 THAT ENTERS THE BUILDING HAS TO PASS PRETTY EXTENSIVE FILTRATION.
BUT THERE IS NO DATA, AND LIKE I 
20:04:03 STATED EARLIER, THE MAIN EFFECT FROM THE FREEWAY IS FROM THE PARTICULATE MATTER, FROM THE DIESEL EXHAUST AND 
20:04:16 FROM PARTICULATE MATTER.
FROM AUTOMOBILE ENGINES AND ROADWAY DUST AND BRAKE DUST AND TIRE WEAR.

20:04:23 >> Councilmember Cox: SO IF I'M UNDERSTANDING THIS, YOUR HEALTH STUDIES IS SHOWING WITH OR WITHOUT 
20:04:28 THIS IS WHERE THEY'RE GETTING THEIR RESULTS AND NOT COMPARED TO OTHER PRODUCTS THAT ARE OUT THERE IN THE 
20:04:37 MARKET?
>> YEAH, WE DIDN'T GO ANY FURTHER BECAUSE WE DIDN'T SEE ANY NEED TO GO 
20:04:48 TO AN EXTENSIVE TYPE OF SYSTEM, SAY, LIKE SOME CARBON -- SOME FILTRATION SYSTEM WITH ACTIVATED CARBON BECAUSE 
20:04:52 IT'S NOT NECESSARY TO BRING IT IN -- BRING THE PROJECT WITHIN THE CITY STANDARDS.

20:04:59 >> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
>> YES.

20:05:05 >> Mayor Mei: CLARIFYING QUESTION, COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN.
>> Councilmember Kassan: THANK YOU.

20:05:16 THIS IS A QUESTION FOR STAFF.
REGARDING THE GENERAL PLAN.
I HEAR THE STATEMENT THAT UNDER THE 
20:05:27 ZONING THAT MUCH MORE DENSE PROJECT WOULD BE ALLOWED, BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THERE CAN BE CASES WHERE THERE 
20:05:35 ARE SORT OF CONTRADICTIONS IN TERMS OF WHAT'S ALLOWED ON A SITE.
SO ACCORDING TO THE LAND USE PART OF 
20:05:45 THE GENERAL PLAN, MORE UNITS WOULD BE ALLOWED ON THE SITE, BUT THAT DOESN'T CHANGE THE FACT THAT ACCORDING TO 
20:05:54 ANOTHER SECTION OF THE GENERAL PLAN, WHICH IS THE NOISE  SECTION, THERE'S MAJOR CONSTRAINTS TO WHAT CAN BE 
20:05:58 DEVELOPED ON THE SITE TO BE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THAT PART OF THE GENERAL PLAN.

20:06:09 SO ISN'T IT A BIT SPECIOUS TO SAY THAT A DEVELOPER -- OR THIS DEVELOPER OR ANY DEVELOPER COULD COME ALONG AND 
20:06:13 BUILD 43 UNITS ON THIS SITE?
BECAUSE IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO BUILD THAT NUMBER OF UNITS GIVEN THE CONDITIONS 
20:06:24 OF THE SITE, THE NOISE AND THE FAULT LINES, THE OTHER CONDITIONS, EVEN THOUGH ACCORDING TO THE LAND USE 
20:06:27 COMPONENT, THEORETICALLY IT COULD BE DONE.
>> THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION.

20:06:38 SO THE LAND USE ELEMENT DOES DESIGNATE THIS SITE AS LOW DENSITY RESIDENTIAL, WHICH COULD POTENTIALLY SUPPORT UP TO 
20:06:51 8.7 DWELLING UNITS PER ACRE.
AN OBJECTIVELY COMPLIANT PROJECT COULD POTENTIALLY REACH THAT CAP OR REACH 
20:06:58 THAT MAXIMUM UNIT COUNT BUT IT WOULD BE SUBJECT TO THE ADOPTED STANDARDS ON THE BOOKS BECAUSE IT WOULD HAVE TO BE 
20:07:04 OBJECTIVELY COMPLIANT, BUT ALSO ADHERE TO OTHER GENERAL PLAN STANDARDS LIKE YOU SAID, LIKE CONDITIONAL NOISE 
20:07:12 THRESHOLDS AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE.
WHAT I WAS TRYING TO SAY BY HIGHLIGHTING THE SORT OF THE CEILING 
20:07:19 FOR THE SITE WAS JUST POINT OUT THAT SB330, IT DEALS WITH WHATEVER THE RESIDENTIAL DESIGNATION IS FOR THE 
20:07:25 SITE AND WHAT THAT CAP WOULD BE.
BUT IT NOT SAYING THAT YOU CAN AUTOMATICALLY HAVE A PROJECT THAT 
20:07:31 LARGE.
THE FUTURE PROJECT WOULD HAVE TO COMPLY WITH OTHER STANDARDS.

20:07:39 >> Councilmember Kassan: AND THERE IS NO STATE LAW THAT REQUIRES CITIES TO APPROVE PROJECTS THAT ARE IN VIOLATION 
20:07:52 OF ANY SECTION OF THEIR GENERAL PLAN.
ISN'T THAT CORRECT?
>> YES, IT'S CORRECT THAT IF THE 
20:07:57 PROJECT DOES NOT CONFORM TO THE GENERAL PLAN, THEN WE WOULD NOT HAVE TO APPROVE IT.

20:08:04 >> Councilmember Kassan: THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
I SEE THERE'S TWO MORE  CLARIFYING 
20:08:09 QUESTIONS FROM COUNCILMEMBER COX, OR IS THIS COMMENTS OR CLARIFYING QUESTIONS STILL AND ALSO COUNCILMEMBER KENG?

20:08:18 >> Councilmember Cox: THANK YOU.
I WANTED TO FIND OUT A LITTLE BIT MORE, THE HOMES THAT ARE CLOSE TO THE 
20:08:28 STORMWATER AND  NICELY DECORATED OR SOMETHING TO THAT EFFECT, AND IS THAT LIKE CLOSER TO ONE OR TWO HOMES OR HOW 
20:08:37 IS THAT SITUATED, AND WHO IS MAINTAINING THE STORMWATER, WHO WOULD BE THE OWNERSHIP OF HAVING TO COME ON 
20:08:44 THE PROPERTY TO CLEAN THAT OUT FROM TIME TO TIME?
>> ARE YOU REFERRING TO THE 
20:08:49 BIOFILTRATION THAT WOULD BE  ADDED TO THE SITE AS PART OF THE PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT OR THE --

20:08:53 >> Councilmember Cox: NO, THERE'S A STORMWATER THAT IS IN THAT PROPERTY AREA.

20:09:03 I WANTED TO FIND OUT WHERE IS IT POSITIONED AND HOW MANY HOMES ARE CLOSE TO IT BECAUSE YOU HAVE FAMILIES, 
20:09:12 KIDS, YOU KNOW, THEY LIKE TO EXPLORE AND BE CURIOUS SO IT COULD COME AS POTENTIAL SAFETY -- A SAFETY RISK.

20:09:19 SO JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THAT PART BECAUSE I KNOW YOU SHOWED SOME BEAUTIFUL DESIGNS AND PICTURES OF THE 
20:09:26  ARCHITECTURE, BUT I JUST WANTED TO FIND OUT WHERE THAT PART IS.
>> THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION.

20:09:33 SO THE NORTHERN END OF THE SITE DOES HAVE AN EXISTING DRAINAGE CHANNEL THAT PASSES THROUGH THE SITE.

20:09:41 IT ACTUALLY GOES UNDER INTERSTATE 680, PASSES THROUGH THE SITE AS AN ABOVE GROUND SURFACE FEATURE AND THEN ENTERS 
20:09:50 INTO AN UNDERGROUND CULVERT THAT GOES BELOW THE NEIGHBORHOOD TO THE WEST.
THE PROPOSED HOMES HAVE BEEN -- THERE 
20:09:57 WAS A STUDY DONE ON THE APPROPRIATE SETBACK FROM THE -- FROM THE DRAINAGE CHANNEL AND ITS ASSOCIATED RIPARIAN 
20:10:03 KIND OF HABITAT AREA THAT SURROUNDS IT.
50 FEET WAS IDENTIFIED AS AN ADEQUATE 
20:10:12 SETBACK FROM THAT FEATURE, AND SO THE WAY THE PROJECT IS LAID OUT, THE  LOT 1 HOME WHICH WOULD BE THE CLOSEST HOME 
20:10:19 IS LOCATED IN EXCESS OF 50 FEET FROM THAT FEATURE.
AND THAT FEATURE WOULD BE, I BELIEVE, 
20:10:28 FENCED OFF WITH A GOOD NEIGHBOR FENCE SO IT WOULD BE INACCESSIBLE BY BIKE LODGE RESIDENTS.

20:10:36 >> AND TO ADDRESS COUNCILMEMBER COX'S QUESTION ABOUT  MAINTENANCE, SO THE HOA WILL BE MAINTAINING THE AREAS OF 
20:10:42 THE PROPERTY.
THERE IS A LITTLE BIT -- AN AREA OF LAND SLIEPPED IN THAT AREA AS WELL 
20:10:49 WHICH WE WOULD BE REMEDIATING AS PART OF THIS PROJECT.
TO ANSWER YOUR BROADER QUESTION, FLOOD 
20:10:54 CONTROL HAS AN EASEMENT THROUGH THAT WHOLE STRETCH OF PROPERTY AND ALSO AN ACCESS EASEMENT THROUGH OUR 
20:10:58 MAINTENANCE ACCESS OFF OF WARREN AVENUE.
SO IT'S GOING TO BE A COMBINATION OF 
20:11:06 THE HOME OTHER THANS ASSOCIATION WITH ALAMEDA COUNTY FLOOD CONTROL.
>> Councilmember Cox: THANK YOU VERY 
20:11:12 MUCH.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
COUNCILMEMBER KENG, I THINK YOU HAVE A 
20:11:15 CLARIFYING QUESTION.
>> Councilmember Keng: YES, THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR.

20:11:28 I HAVE A QUESTION FOR STAFF AND SO EARLIER YOU WERE REFERRING TO A PROJECT WITH MORE UNITS, LIKE MORE 
20:11:40 THAN 40 UNITS TO BE  APPROVED AND WOULDN'T THAT BRING MORE AIR AND NOISE DURING THE CONSTRUCTION AS WELL 
20:11:53 BECAUSE OF THE -- IF IT'S HIGHER MULTILEVEL CONDO UNITS OR TOWNHOMES, THEY WOULD REQUIRE DEEPER FOUNDATIONS 
20:12:05 AND THINGS LIKE THAT?
>> SO THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT WAS ANALYZED BASED ON THE PROJECT 
20:12:10 DESCRIPTION, BASED ON THE SCOPE OF WORK.
A DIFFERENT PROJECT WILL UNDERGO A 
20:12:16 SIMILAR EVALUATION FOR ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS ON IMPACTS OF THE ENVIRONMENT ON FUTURE RESIDENTS.

20:12:22 SO YES, IT WOULD BE THOROUGHLY STUDIED SIMILAR TO HOW THIS PROJECT WAS STUDIED.

20:12:29 >> Councilmember Keng: OKAY.
THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN, 
20:12:31 CLARIFYING QUESTIONS?
>> Councilmember Salwan: YEAH, A QUELL FOR STAFF.

20:12:41 THIS PROJECT KIND OF REMINDS ME OF A METRO PROJECT, SOME OF THE NOISE ISSUES AND SO FORTH.

20:12:50 I'M JUST TRYING TO FOR  COMPARISON SAKE, WHAT WERE THE DECIBELS AT THE METRO PROJECT AND HOW DO WE MITIGATE 
20:12:56 THOSE AND HOW DO WE LEARN FROM THAT PROJECT?
AS FAR AS THE SHORTCOMINGS OR WHAT WE 
20:13:03 CAN DO DIFFERENT?
>> Mr. Pullen: WE DON'T HAVE THOSE DECIBEL NUMBERS READILY AVAILABLE, AND 
20:13:11 YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE METRO CROSSING PROJECT THAT WAS DEVELOPED BY TOLL BETWEEN SOUTH GRIMMER BOULEVARD, KIND 
20:13:16 OF -- AND WARM SPRINGS BOULEVARD ACROSS FROM THE BART STATION, RIGHT?
>> Councilmember Salwan: THAT'S 
20:13:22 CORRECT.
>> Mr. Pullen: SO WE DON'T HAVE THE DECIBEL LIMITS BUT IN GENERAL, THE 
20:13:26 METHOD OF  ATTENUATING NOISE WAS BECAUSE THERE WAS MULTIFAMILY BUILDINGS.

20:13:36 THE PRIMARY METHOD WAS TO TURN THE INTERNAL FOYERS OR THE INTERNAL CIRCULATION TOWARD THE FREEWAY TO 
20:13:43 PROVIDE SORT OF ADDITIONAL SPACE BETWEEN THE UNITS AND THE FREEWAY.
SO IF YOU LOOK AT THOSE -- ALL THOSE 
20:13:52 BUILDINGS ALONG 680 HAD ANOTHER LEVEL OF INTERNAL AREA. BEFORE YOU GET TO YOUR UNIT TO DEADEN THAT NOISE.

20:14:00 THEN ADJACENT TO THE OPEN  SPACES, BECAUSE THOSE OPEN SPACES WERE EXTERIOR, THERE WAS AN ADDITIONAL WALL 
20:14:12 PLACED THAT WAS LOWER, NOT ALL THE WAY UNIFORMLY ALONG BUT GRADUATED IN HEIGHT WHERE NECESSARY TO ACCOMMODATE 
20:14:18 THE NOISE REDUCTION FOR THOSE EXTERIOR COMMON OPEN SPACES THAT WERE TO BE  PROTECTED.

20:14:26 SO THERE WAS SORT OF A COMBINATION OF FEATURES THAT HELPED ATTENUATE THE NOISE.

20:14:31 >> Councilmember Salwan: OKAY, BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE A LOT OF FOLKS WERE STILL KIND OF FRUSTRATED WITH THE 
20:14:36 NOISE AND I STILL GET EMAILS ABOUT THAT.
SO I DEFINITELY DON'T WANT THAT TO BE 
20:14:42 THE ISSUE GOING FORWARD.
SO THE LARGER FRAMEWORK, BASICALLY THIS IS HERE TO US BECAUSE IT WAS 
20:14:47 APPEALED BY THE PLANNING COMMISSION, AND THIS PROJECT IS NOT STRAIGHT GENERAL PLAN, RIGHT?

20:14:53 THERE'S SOME EXCEPTIONS THAT WE'RE GRANTING IN THIS PROCESS, IS THAT CORRECT?

20:15:02 >> THE PROJECT IS CONSISTENT WITH THE GENERAL PLAN LAND USE ELEMENT, BUT FOR THE SAFETY ELEMENT, BECAUSE 11 OF THE 
20:15:11 13 LOTS WOULD HAVE EXTERIOR NOISE LEVELS WITHIN THAT CONDITIONALLY APPROVED -- CONDITIONALLY ACCEPTABLE 
20:15:23 RANGE OF 60 TO 65 DECIBELS, YOU WOULD HAVE THE DISCRETION TO ALLOW THOSE 11 HOMES, THOSE 11 LOTS TO HAVE NOISE 
20:15:30 LEVELS WITHIN THAT RANGE.
>> Mr. Pullen: I WANT TO PIGGY BACK ON THAT A LITTLE BIT JUST TO EXPLAIN THE 
20:15:37 TRADEOFF HERE.
THE HOMES ARE DESIGNED IN SUCH A WAY AS TO REDUCE THE NOISE AS MUCH AS IS 
20:15:45 PRACT COMPARABLE GIVEN THE SITE-SPECIFIC CONDITIONS.
THE GENERAL PLAN DISCOURAGES THE USE 
20:15:52 OF SOUND WALLS ON A PROJECT ADJACENT TO THE FREEWAY OR WHERE THE EXISTING NOISE ENVIRONMENT IS ABOVE THE LIMIT.

20:16:06  AND REQUIRES MITIGATIONS TO BE PLACED, PRIORITIZING ONES BASED ON LANDSCAPING AND EARTHEN METHODS SUCH AS WHAT'S 
20:16:13 BEEN PROPOSED TONIGHT AND SITE DESIGN.
WHEN IT COMES TO THE ISSUES YOU'RE DESCRIBING, THE GENERAL PLAN HAS A 
20:16:21 BAND THAT'S BUILT INTO IT THAT SAYS THERE IS A CONDITIONALLY ACCEPTABLE RANGE THAT THE COUNCIL HAS DISCRETION 
20:16:28 TO ALLOWL A PROJECT WITHIN.
SO IT'S NOT THAT THE PROJECT CANNOT BE APPROVED WITHIN THAT BAND.

20:16:35 YOU HAVE DISCRETION WITHIN THAT BAND TO REQUIRE TO BE LESS THAN THAT BAND OR WITHIN THAT BAND.

20:16:39 >> Councilmember Salwan: THANK YOU FOR THAT CLARIFICATION.
THAT'S ALL THE QUESTIONS FOR  NOW.

20:16:44 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
COUNCILMEMBER SHAO, CLARIFYING QUESTION.

20:16:52 >> Vice Mayor Shao: THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR.
SO REGARDING THOSE LOT WIDTH AND FRONT 
20:17:07 SETBACK THAT ARE NOT IN COMPLIANCE WITH  R-1-6 REQUIREMENTS, ARE THESE FALLING INTO THE SO-CALLED ACCEPTABLE GRAY 
20:17:14 AREA RANGE?
>> SO THIS IS A REZONING REQUEST FOR A PLANNED DISTRICT.

20:17:23 THE PLANNED DISTRICTS ARE INTENDED TO BE UTILIZED WHEN THERE'S A SITE THAT HAS PHYSICAL CONSTRAINTS THAT MAKE IT 
20:17:34 DIFFICULT TO DEVELOP ?RUND A STAN TARRED ZONING DISTRICT, SO THERE'S FLEXIBILITY REPORTED TO A 
20:17:43 DEVELOPMENT.
HE'S PROPOSING FRONT YARD SETBACKS OF 11.2 TO 18 FEET INSTEAD OF NOT LESS 
20:17:53 THAN  20 FEET, OR SIX OF THOSE HOMES, AND THEN LOT WIDTH RAO DUCKS FROM 55 FEET DOWN TO IF TWO FEET TO ACCOUNT 
20:18:02 FOR THE SITE CONSTRAINTS.
SO THROUGH A PLANNED DISTRICT, YOU DO HAVE FLEXIBILITY, AND FLEXIBILITY IS 
20:18:10 BEING SOUGHT, YOU KNOW, IN THOSE TWO PARTICULAR AREAS.
>> Vice Mayor Shao: TO MAKE SURE I 
20:18:22 UNDERSTOOD WHAT YOU JUST SAID, SO THIS TYPE OF FLEXIBILITY IS JUST GIVEN OR STILL UNDER THE COUNCIL'S DISCRETION?

20:18:34 >> Mr. Pullen: YOU HAVE THE DISCRETION PER THE CITY'S ZONING ORDINANCE TO IDENTIFY WHAT EXCEPTIONS TO THE 
20:18:42 STANDARDS ZONING IS ALLOWED IN A PD, BY OUR LOCAL STANDARDS.
IN A SITUATION LIKE MARK WAS SAYING, 
20:18:52 IN A SITUATION LIKE THIS AND MANY OTHER PREVIOUS SITUATIONS, THE TOPOGRAPHY IS AN EXPRESS REASON STATED IN OUR CODE 
20:18:59 FOR WHY IT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE TO GRANT CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS.
SO FOR EXAMPLE, IN THIS STAFF 
20:19:10 RECOMMENDATIONS PROJECT DESIGN, THE FRONT YARD SETBACK IS REDUCED, THE OVERALL LOT MODULE FITS BETTER INTO 
20:19:20 THE DEPTH OF THE PROJECT BEHIND THE ROAD, WHICH HELPS WITH THE A GRADING, HELPS AVOID THE FAULT AND THINGS LIKE 
20:19:24 THAT.
SO IN ANY SITUATION WHEN STAFF IS REVIEWING THESE AS THEY COME FORWARD, 
20:19:42 WE'RE LOOKING TO MAKE SURE THAT ANY EXCEPTIONS BEING REQUESTED FROM R-1-6, THAT THEY'RE WARRANTED BY THE 
20:19:52 PARTICULARS OF THIS LOT.
DOES THAT MAKE SENSE?
>> Vice Mayor Shao: WELL, I UNDERSTOOD 
20:19:59 WHAT YOU JUST SAID.
>> Mr. Pullen: DID I ANSWER YOUR QUESTION SUFFICIENTLILY TO SAY R 
20:20:06 ZONING ALLOWS THE -- OR R ZONING ALLOWS TO YOU MAKE THE DETERMINATION AS TO THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THE  
20:20:10 EXCEPTIONS?
>> Vice Mayor Shao: RIGHT.
MY UNDERSTANDING, IT'S STILL UNDER THE 
20:20:19 COUNCIL'S DISCRETION TO GRANT THIS FLEXIBILITY ON THAT.
>> Mr. Pullen: CORRECT.

20:20:29 KEEPING IN MIND THAT AS MARK HAD INDICATED IN HIS PRESENTATION, THAT THE GENERAL PLAN AGAIN TAKING THE 
20:20:37 CONSTRAINTS OFF OF THE SITE, OFF OF THE DEVELOPABLE PORTION OF THE SITE, SO IN THE CALCULATIONS PRESENTED TONIGHT BY 
20:20:47 BOTH MARK AND THE APPLICANT, THE AREA THAT IS NOT ABLE TO BE DEVELOPED BECAUSE OF THE FAULT ISN'T CALCULATED 
20:20:54 IN THE GENERAL PLAN DENSITY CALCULATION BECAUSE THAT'S NETTED OUT.
SO TAKING THE REMAINING  DEVELOPABLE 
20:21:05 AREA, THERE'S A UNIT YIELD THAT THIS PROJECT IS AT THE BASE.
IF YOU WERE TO LOOK AT THE DENSITY 
20:21:14 RANGE THAT COULD BE PROPOSED, THERE COULD BE POTENTIALLY CONFORMING PROJECTS THAT WOULD EXCEED THE CURRENT 
20:21:19 NUMBER OR BE THE SAME AS CURRENT NUMBER, THAT WOULD -- GIVEN OUR EXPERIENCE BACK AND FORTH WITH THE 
20:21:28 APPLICANT, NOT NECESSARILY REPRESENT AN IMPROVEMENT OVER THE SITE-SPECIFIC CONTEXTUAL DEVELOPMENT THAT'S BEING 
20:21:37 PROPOSED TONIGHT WITH THOSE EXCEPTIONS.
THAT'S THE TRADEOFF HERE OF THE ZONING 
20:21:47 PLANNED DISTRICT  DEVELOPMENT TYPE.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU FOR THE CLARIFYING QUESTIONS.

20:21:52 AT THIS TIME, WE'RE GOING TO GO FOR PUBLIC COMMENT, AND SEEING THAT WE HAVE ABOUT 30 SPEAKERS, I'M GOING TO 
20:21:57 GO WITH A MINUTE EACH.
AND I SEE THEY'RE COMING IN, BUT I ALSO WILL NOTE THAT AT 8:30, WE WILL 
20:22:03 BE TAKING A QUICK BREAK BECAUSE -- AND EACH SPEAKER CAN ONLY SPEAK ONCE.
BUT WE'LL BE TAKING A QUICK BREAK 
20:22:13 BECAUSE WE NEED TO GIVE OUR STENOCAPTIONER A BREAK ALSO.
SO WE'LL BEGIN WITH MINGLY WU.

20:22:20 WELCOME.
>> THANK YOU.
MY NAME IS MINGLIE WU.

20:22:27 I'M HERE TODAY TO STATE MY SUPPORT FOR THE OMAHA WAY PROJECT.
I HAVE ALWAYS LOVED THE CITY OF 
20:22:33 FREMONT.
PERSONALLY, I VIEW THIS AS THE BEST CITY TO LIVE IN AND RAISE THE CHILDREN 
20:22:38 IN THE UNITED STATES.
I HAVE TWO GROWN CHILDREN, STARTING THEIR OWN FAMILIES NOW.

20:22:45 THEY ALL WANTED TO LIVE IN FREMONT.
I BELIEVE THE OMAHA WAY IS THE IDEAL HOUSING PROJECT FOR MY -- FOR FREMONT, 
20:22:51 NICE NEIGHBORHOOD, FOR HARD WORKING FAMILIES TO RAISE CHILDREN AND TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE OVERALL WELL-BEING 
20:22:58 OF THIS WONDERFUL CITY OF FREMONT.
AND THROUGHOUT THE YEARS, COUNCILMEMBERS OF THE CITY OF FREMONT

NEXT SPEAKER IS PARDEEP GANDHI.

20:23:37 >> HI.
MY NAME IS PRADEEP GANDHI.
I'M IN SUPPORT OF THIS PROJECT.

20:23:44 MANY YEARS BACK, WE HAD FOUND A HOME IN PLEASANTON.
BEAUTIFUL PONDEROSA HOME.

20:23:51 BUT MY WIFE TURNED OUT TO BE MUCH SMARTER THAN ME AND SAID, HEY, FREMONT IS A LOT MORE CENTRALLY LOCATED AND 
20:24:00 THAT'S THE BEST DECISION WE EVER MADE.
FREMONT IS A GROWING CITY, WE MOST DEFINITELY NEED HOUSING.

20:24:11 MANY YEARS BACK, YOU SAW THAT MISSION HILLS BEHIND COUNCILMEMBER JONES WAS TALKING, YOU KNOW, THERE WAS A WINERY, 
20:24:20 NOW THERE ARE HOMES AND THAT'S WHERE I FOUND MY BEST FRIENDS.
WE REALLY NEED HOUSING, AND MR. PULL 
20:24:30 ENSAID IT BEST, IT'S A F TRADEOFF.
WE HAVE TO DRIVE 2, 3 MILES FOR A PARK.

20:24:35 SO THE CITY WILL HAVE TO GO VERTICAL, THERE WON'T BE ANY CHOICE.
SO IT A HUGE TRADEOFF THAT WE HAVE TO 
20:24:48 MAKE SOME GOOD DECISION ON.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
NEXT SPEAKER IS JOHN POO.

20:24:52 >> HI.
HONORABLE MAYOR, COUNCILMEMBER, MY NAME IS JOHN POO.

20:24:59 I AM SPEAKING TODAY IN SUPPORT OF THE OMAHA WAY HOMES PROJECT.
THIS DEVELOPMENT IS GOOD FOR THE CITY 
20:25:07 AND THE NEIGHBORHOOD, AND ALTHOUGH THIS PROJECT IS SMALL AND COMPARED TO OTHER PROJECTS, IT WILL STILL ADD VALUABLE 
20:25:15 HOUSING STOCK TO A CRITICALLY LOW SUPPLY.
EVERY ADDITION TO THIS HOUSING STOCK 
20:25:21 WILL HELP BALANCE THE SUPPLY AND DEMAND CURVE.
SO YOUR SUPPORT AND APPROVAL FOR THIS 
20:25:27 APPLICATION WILL REPRESENT YOUR COMMITMENT TO HELP RESOLVE CALIFORNIA AND THE BAY AREA'S HOUSING CRISIS.

20:25:36 I URGE YOU TO SUPPORT AND APPROVE OMAHA WAY HOMES PROJECT.
AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR PUBLIC 
20:25:46 SERVICE.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
NEXT SPEAKER IS SOHAIL UMAR.

20:25:50 >> CAN YOU HEAR ME?

>> Mayor Mei: YES.

20:25:56 >> I LIVE ON YUCATAN DRIVE, A STREET BEING DIRECTLY AFFECTED BY THE PROPOSED OMAHA WAY HOMES DEVELOPMENT.

20:26:02 I WOULD LIKE TO VOICE MY  CONCERNS AS FOLLOWS.
THE FIRST CONCERN IS ABOUT TRAFFIC.

20:26:10 OMAHA WAY IS A NARROW STREET.
IT'S THE ONLY ENTRY AND EXIT FOR THE NEW DEVELOPMENT.
