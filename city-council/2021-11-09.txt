19:07:15  GARCIA.
AND
19:07:18  I'D LIKE TO SHARE THE FOLLOWING:
19:07:24  WHEREAS, IN 1954, PRESIDENT DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER SIGNED LEGISLATION WHICH PROCLAIMED EVERY NOVEMBER 11TH AS A 
19:07:27 DAY TO HONOR ALL VETERANS OF THE UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES; AND

19:07:47  AMERICANS DOES NOT COME WITHOUT
19:07:51  A PRICE. OUR NATION’S MILITARY VETERANS HAVE SACRIFICED TO PRESERVE
19:07:55  AND PROTECT THOSE RIGHTS FROM ALL ENEMIES FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC; AND WHEREAS, WE HONOR AND PAY HOMAGE

19:10:43  AND I THINK I KNOW SOME OF YOUR FAMILY
19:10:46  BY CHANCE.
IF YOU'D LIKE TO SHARE 2 OR
19:10:49  3 MINUTES, THAT WOULD BE TERRIFIC.
THANK YOU.

19:10:54 >> DO YOU WANT TO TELL THEM ANYTHING, DAD?

19:11:04 TELL HER THANK YOU.

19:11:08 >> HE'S HARD OF HEARING AND HE CAN'T SEE VERY WELL.

19:11:12 SO HE WANTED TO THANK YOU AND THE
19:11:15  VETERANS FOR ALL YOU'VE  DONE,
19:11:19  AND IN FREMONT,
19:11:22  I'D LIKE TO THANK THE CITY OF FREMONT AND TERESA COX
19:11:32  FOR HELPING TO ARRANGE THIS.
THAT WAS VERY SWEET
19:11:36 , FOR GIVING DAD THIS HONOR, AND
19:11:39  ALSO FOR HIS GREAT DRIVE-BY
19:11:42  PARTY HE IN JANUARY, WHEN HE TURNED 9 #
19:11:45  98, THAT WAS A JOY NOT ONLY TO HIM BUT TO EVERYBODY THAT
19:11:48  PARTICIPATED DURING A REALLY DIFFICULT TIME THAT BROUGHT A LOT
19:11:51  OF JOY.
I HAD A LOT OF OTHER
19:11:54  THINGS WRITTEN DOWN, BUT I'M NOT A GOOD SPEAKER SO I'LL JUST LEAVE IT
19:11:58  AT I REALLY APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'VE
19:12:01  DONE.
MY DAD ENLISTED IN THE SERVICE IN
19:12:05  TEXAS WHEN HE HAD SEVERE ASTHMA, BUT HE DIDN'T TELL ANYBODY ABOUT
19:12:08  IT BECAUSE HE WANTED TO JOIN THE NAVY, AND WHEN HE
19:12:11  WAS AT SEA, HIS ASTHMA WENT AWAY, AND WHEN HE CAME TO FREMONT
19:12:14 , HE DIDN'T HAVE HIS ASTHMA.
HE LOVES THE WEATHER
19:12:17  HERE AND THE PEOPLE, AND THE COMMUNITY.

19:12:20 SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
OH, AND ONE MORE THING.

19:12:24 BACK WHEN DAD WAS IN THE  SERVICE,
19:12:28  IN WORLD WAR II, THERE WAS NO SUCH THING AS
19:12:32  PTSD AND OTHER THINGS LIKE THAT THAT ARE NOW
19:12:35  KNOWN.
SO PEOPLE HAD TO JUST GO AND SUFFER WITH THAT IN SILENCE
19:12:39 .
BUT NOW PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO PAY
19:12:42  ATTENTION TO ALL THE THINGS THAT THE VETERANS NEED AND HELP
19:12:45  THEM AND WE REALLY APPRECIATE  IT.

19:12:48 >> THANK YOU.

19:13:10 THEY'RE A WONDERFUL FAMILY IN DISTRICT 6 IN IRVINGTON,
19:13:13  BUT ALSO THERE'S A SPECIAL CONNECTION BECAUSE I WORKED FOR THE NAVAL WEAPONS
19:13:17  STATION ALONGSIDE OUR MILITARY TO SUPPORT

19:14:02  SERVE IN THE U.S. MARINES DURING PERSIAN GULF WAR,
19:14:05  SO I ALSO WANT TO EXPRESS OUR THANKS

19:14:22  SERVED AND I WANT TO APPRECIATE ALL THOSE, BUT NEXT I'D LIKE TO
19:14:26  SHARE A RESOLUTION IN RECOGNITION OF VETERANS' DAY AND
19:14:30  THIS IS TO -- AND ALSO

19:14:41  MICKEY GANITCH WHO WILL BE CELEBRATING HIS
19:14:47  102ND BIRTHDAY THIS COMING
19:14:50  WEEK, SO I'D LIKE TO SHARE THIS.

19:14:57  WHEREAS, NOVEMBER 11TH HAS BEEN DESIGNATED AS VETERANS DAY, A DAY IN WHICH AMERICA PUBLICLY HONORS THE 
19:15:00 CONTRIBUTION AND SACRIFICES OF ALL THOSE WHO “HONORED A CALL TO DUTY” IN SERVICE TO THE NATION; AND WHEREAS, 
19:15:03 FOR MANY YEARS, MILLIONS OF AMERICANS HAVE ANSWERED OUR NATION’S CALL
19:15:06  TO DEFEND OUR FREEDOM AND OUR
19:15:09  REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRATIC FORM OF GOVERNMENT AGAINST ALL ENEMIES FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC;
19:15:15  AND WHEREAS, SUCH SERVICE HAS REQUIRED THAT VETERANS PLACE THE NATION’S SECURITY
19:15:19  ABOVE THEIR OWN LIVES AND ALL ELSE IN DEFENSE OF OUR NATION
19:15:23  WHEN THEY ANSWERED AMERICA’S CALL TO DUTY; AND SUCH SERVICE
19:15:29  HAS REQUIRED SIGNIFICANT HARDSHIP AND SACRIFICE BY FAMILY MEMBERS OF THE MEN AND WOMEN SERVING IN THE ARMED
19:15:32  SERVICES AND BEYOND; AND WHEREAS, THE CITY OF FREMONT
19:15:40  HONORS OUR OWN NAVY WORLD WAR II
19:15:44  VETERAN MICHAEL “MICKEY GANITCH WHO IS ALMOST 102 YEARS OLD ENLISTED IN THE US NAVY IN
19:15:49  JANUARY OF 1941 AND JOINED THE USS PENNSYLVANIA (BB-38) AT PEARL HARBOR ON AUGUST 15, 1941
19:15:57 
AND WAS AT THAT TIME A MEMBER OF THE SHIP'S
19:16:03  FOOTBALL TEAM. HIS SHIP WAS DUE TO PLAY THE USS
19:16:06  ARIZONA ON DECEMBER 7, 1941, AT 1:00PM, FOR THE FLEET CHAMPIONSHIP WHEN THE FIRST AIR
19:16:11  ATTACK BY THE JAPANESE COMMENCED, HIS SHIP WAS USED AS FIRE SUPPORT FOR ALL MAJOR
19:16:16  INVASIONS OF THE NORTH PACIFIC OCEAN EXCEPT FOR OKINAWA AND IWO
19:16:20  JIMA. ON AUGUST 12, 1945, THE USS PENNSYLVANIA WAS HIT BY A
19:16:26  TORPEDO AT OKINAWA.
AND I BELIEVE HE LOST
19:16:29  20 OF HIS 26 MEMBERS OF
19:16:32  HIS CREW AT THAT TIME, HIS QUARTER MASTERS.

19:16:39 AFTER THE WAR IN 1947,

19:16:57 THE NAVY AS SENIOR CHIEF QUARTERMASTER.
19:17:01  UPON RETIRING FROM THE NAVY, MICKEY WORKED IN A BOWLING ESTABLISHMENT, THEN TWENTY YEARS FOR A FISHING NET 
19:17:05 MANUFACTURER IN EAST OAKLAND, AND FOR
19:17:09  FIVE YEARS AS A SECURITY GUARD
19:17:14 
AT THE NAVE AIR STATION AT ALAMEDA.

19:17:18  WHEREAS, MICKEY STILL CURRENTLY SERVES AS THE PEARL HARBOR
19:17:22  SURVIVORS' PAST STATE TREASURER, PAST CHAPTER SECRETARY, AND EDITOR OF THE
19:17:25  MONTHLY NEWSLETTER FOR PHSA CHAPTER NO. 2, OF THE SAN

19:17:48  FOR VFW. MICKEY IS A VA VOLUNTEER DRIVER,
19:17:51  AND OTHER DUTIES, SERVING OVER 7,000 VOLUNTEER HOURS FOR THE VA.

19:18:00  51 YEARS TO HIS WIFE, BARBARA. TOGETHER THEY HAVE RAISED 4
19:18:04  DAUGHTERS; AND BLESSED WITH 13 GRANDCHILDREN; 18

19:18:46 
COMMUNITY AND FOR THE HONOR OF OUR COUNTRY.

19:18:49 AND SO I'D ASK PEOPLE JOIN US ON NOVEMBER 11TH IN OBSERVANCE
19:18:53  OF VETERANS' DAY AND ACCEPTING THE RESOLUTION, I THINK
19:18:56  I SEE MICKEY AND
19:19:00  IN HIS HAWAIIAN SHIRT AS WELL AS HIS HAT, AS WELL AS

FIRST SPEAKER IS KELLY ABREU.

19:23:08 >> THANK YOU.
ALAMEDA COUNTY
19:23:12  HAS A COUPLE OF IMPORTANT THINGS GOING ON RIGHT NOW.

19:23:15 ONE IS REDISTRICTING.
THE COUNTY HAS FIVE SUPERVISOR
19:23:19 S THAT HANDLE A BUDGET OF OVER
19:23:22  $3 BILLION.
COMPARE THAT TO THE CITY WITH A BUDGET
19:23:25  OF $250 MILLION OR WHATEVER
19:23:29  AND
19:23:32  SEVEN  COUNCILMEMBERS.
SO EACH COUNTY SUPERVISOR
19:23:36  IS RESPONSIBLE FOR A HECK OF A LOT OF
19:23:41  BUDGETARY SPENDING AND A LOT OF OTHER THINGS.
THE REDISTRICTING PROPOSAL
19:23:44 S ARE OUT THERE, THE TRI-VALLEY IS VERY INTERESTED IN
19:23:48  BEING KEPT TOGETHER.
THE HAYWARD
19:23:51  EDEN AREA AND CASTRO VALLEY ARE
19:23:54  VERY INTERESTED, SAN LEANDRO, THEY'RE INTERESTED IN
19:23:57  BEING KEPT TOGETHER.
FREMONT IS SILENT.
FREMONT IS A
19:24:00  BLACK HOLE OF SILENCE
19:24:03 .
PEOPLE FROM FREMONT HAVE NOT EXPRESSED
19:24:07  ANY -- VERY MUCH IN TERMS OF HOW TO KEEP
19:24:11  THE TRI-CITIES TOGETHER.
THAT'S UNION CITY, FREMONT
19:24:14 , AND NEWARK.
THE WEBSITE
19:24:17  IS  REDISTRICTING2021.

19:24:20 THE NEXT MEETING OF THE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS WHERE THEY'LL
19:24:23  HEAR PUBLIC COMMENTS AND PEOPLE FROM FREMONT ARE WELCOME TO CALL
19:24:27  IN IS NOVEMBER 16TH AT 6:00 P.M.

19:24:32 THERE ARE THREE DRAFT PROPOSALS OUT THERE.
TWO OF
19:24:35  THEM -- ONLY ONE OF THEM WOULD KEEP THE TRI-CITIES TOGETHER.

19:24:38 THE OTHER TWO PROPOSALS ARE PROPOSING
19:24:41  TO SPLIT UP FREMONT OFF -- CUT
19:24:44  IT OFF FROM NEWARK, CUT IT OFF FROM UNION CITY
19:24:47 .
THIS IS WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR 10 YEARS
19:24:51 .
52% OF
19:24:54  THE DISTRICT 1, FREMONT'S
19:24:57  PEOPLE COMPRISE 52% OF THE POPULATION OF DISTRICT 1.
BUT
19:25:01  PEOPLE -- WHEN REFERRING TO DISTRICT 1, IT IS
19:25:04  VERY OFTEN -- FREMONT IS FORGOTTEN,
19:25:07  AND PEOPLE THINK DISTRICT 1 REPRESENTS LIVERMORE.

19:25:13 OR DUBLIN.
BUT FREMONT COMPRISES 52% OF THE POPULATION
19:25:17 .
SO
19:25:21  ON THE OTHER SUBJECT AGAIN WITH THE COUNTY IS,
19:25:24  SUPERVISOR CHAN DIED SUDDENLY AND TRAGICALLY A FEW DAYS AGO
19:25:28 .
HER IMPACT ON THE COUNTY WAS
19:25:32  ENORMOUS, ENORMOUS.
AND
19:25:35  ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO
19:25:40  CIVIL RIGHT AND SOCIAL JUSTICE ISSUES
19:25:43  AND PUBLIC WELFARE AND HUNGER AND HOME
19:25:47 LESSNESS AND ALL THOSE KIND OF THINGS.

19:25:51 SHE WAS WELL EDUCATED IN THESE SUBJECTS IN PUBLIC
19:25:54  POLICY ISSUES AND DEVOTED A HUGE AMOUNT OF WORK
19:25:57  INTO THIS.

19:26:02 VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT THESE ISSUES.
NO COMBINATION OF POLITICIANS IS GOING TO
19:26:05  BE ABLE TO REPLACE HER, SO
19:26:09  WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A HUGE DROPOFF IN SOCIAL SERVICES IN THIS COUNTY.

19:26:13 JUST FOR --
19:26:19 
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU, KELLY, FOR SHARING.

19:26:22 WE WILL ACTUALLY BE ADJOURNING THE MEETING THIS EVENING
19:26:26  AND I'LL MAKE SOME COMMENTS ABOUT SUPERVISOR CHAN AT THE END THIS EVENING.

19:26:31 NEXT -- DO WE HAVE ANY OTHER SPEAKERS FOR ORAL COMMUNICATIONS
19:26:34  COMMUNICATIONS?
OKAY.

19:26:38 SEEING NONE, I'M GOING TO THEN TURN IT OVER
19:26:41  TO OUR REGULARLY SCHEDULED AGENDIZED ITEM
19:26:44 , AND THIS EVENING IT'S ITEM
19:26:47  7A, WHICH IS TO AUTHORIZE THE CITY MANAGER TO EXECUTE A LEASE AGREEMENT
19:26:51 . WITH EAST BAY REGIONAL PARK DISTRICT

19:29:41  TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE AND I WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY FOR JOINING US
19:29:44  THIS EVENING.
NEXT SLIDE.

19:29:48 SO THE CURRENT STATUS OF OUR LEASE AGREEMENT WITH
19:29:51  MISSION PEAK IS THAT WE HAVE HAD A LEASE WITH EAST BAY
19:29:55  REGIONAL PARK SINCE 1978, AND
19:29:58  WE LEASE 900 ACRES OF OPEN SPACE
19:30:01  CONSERVATION AREA TO EAST BAY REGIONAL PARKS TO OPERATE AND MAINTAIN.

19:30:05 THE CURRENT LEASE AGREEMENT EXPIRED IN JULY OF
19:30:08  2020 AND WE ARE CURRENTLY ON THE SAME TERMS IN A
19:30:12  MONTH TO MONTH LEASE WITH THEM.
THEY AND
19:30:15  WE CONTINUE TO PROMOTE OHLONE COLLEGE AS THE
19:30:18  MAIN TRAIL ACCESS POINT AND WE CONTINUE
19:30:22  TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO USE THE OHLONE PARKING LOT
19:30:25  AS THE MAIN SITE AS THEY HAVE 900 SPACES
19:30:28 .
THE CITY HAS ESTABLISHED A PERMANENT
19:30:31  PARKING PROGRAM TO OVERSIGHT AND ENFORCE PERMIT
19:30:34  PARKING THROUGHOUT THE FREMONT AREA AND THAT INCLUDES THE MISSION PEAK
19:30:37  PERMIT AREA AS WELL AS CENTERVILLE.
NEXT SLIDE.

19:30:43 SO WE HAVE TWO DIFFERENT
19:30:46  PEAK ACCESSES IN FREMONT.

19:30:49 ONE IS THE MISSION PEAK ACCESS AT OHLONE
19:30:52  COLLEGE.
THAT HAS 900 SPACES.
THERE IS
19:30:56  A PARKING FEE OF $4.
AND IT'S OPEN FROM
19:30:59  6:00 A.M. UNTIL 11:00 P.M.
AND I WANT TO NOTE THAT
19:31:02  WE ARE WORKING TOGETHER AS THIS LEASE AGREEMENT
19:31:06  THAT WE'RE BRINGING BEFORE YOU IS TO MINIMIZE
19:31:09  THE IMPACTS TO THE MISSION PEAK NEIGHBORHOOD AND
19:31:12  THE STANFORD AVENUE, AND TO BALANCE HIKE
19:31:15 ER ACCESS WITH NEIGHBORHOOD SAFETY AND QUALITY OF LIFE.

19:31:18 NEXT SLIDE.

19:31:22 THE MISSION PEAK ACCESS ON THE STANFORD AVENUE ENTRANCE
19:31:25  HAS 43 SPACES AND
19:31:28  APPROXIMATELY 150 STREET SPACES TOTALING APPROXIMATELY
19:31:32  200.

19:31:35 THEIR TIME OF OPENING IS FROM DECEMBER
19:31:39  23RD TO MARCH 31ST FROM
19:31:43  6:30 A.M. TO 8:00 P.M. AND FROM APRIL 1ST TO DECEMBER
19:31:46  22ND FROM 6:30 A.M. TO 9:00 P.M.
YOU CAN SEE ON THE LOWER
19:31:49  SLIDE, THE PARKING ZONE THAT WAS CREATED AS PART OF
19:31:52  THAT IN 2016.
NEXT SLIDE
19:31:55 , PLEASE.
THIS IS A REALLY
19:31:59  IMPORTANT SLIDE I WANTED TO SHOW YOU.
THIS WAS ACTUALLY PROVIDED TO US
19:32:02  FROM EAST BAY REGIONAL PARKS, AND I WANT
19:32:05 ED TO SHOW THAT THE AREA THAT'S
19:32:08  SURROUNDED IN  YELLOW, INCLUDING THE STANFORD AREA PARK
19:32:12  ENTRANCE, COVERS THE 900 ACRES THAT YOU SEE THERE, BUT YOU CAN
19:32:15  NOTE THAT THE EAST BAY REGIONAL
19:32:18  PARK DISTRICT HAS THE TITLE FEE TO
19:32:24  1748 ACRES AND THEY ALSO LEASE WITH OHLONE COLLEGE
19:32:28  375 ACRES, AND YOU CAN SEE THAT OHLONE COLLEGE
19:32:31  ENTRANCE IN THE UPPER LEFT-HAND CORNER OF THE MAP.

19:32:35 THERE'S ALSO AN ENTRANCE TO GET TO
19:32:38  MISSION PEAK THROUGH THE U.S.
19:32:42  SUNOL ENTRANCE WHICH IS CLOSE TO THE VISITORS CENTER OFF
19:32:45  OF CALAVERAS BOULEVARD, AND ALSO THROUGH
19:32:48  ED LEVINE COUNTY PARK, WHICH IS A MUCH LONGER WALK
19:32:51  THROUGH MILIPITAS.
SO JUST TO NOTE THAT THERE'S SEVERAL
19:32:54  WAYS TO GET TO MISSION PEAK.
BUT THE
19:32:58  ONE THAT WE'RE SPEAKING OF THIS EVENING IN PARTICULAR FOR THE LEASE AGREEMENT IS THROUGH
19:33:01  STANFORD AVENUE PARKING ENTRANCE.

19:33:04 ALTHOUGH WE WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH EAST BAY REGIONAL
19:33:08  PARKS IN TERMS OF OHLONE COLLEGE PARK ENTRANCE AS WELL AS ALL
19:33:11  OF OUR SEVEN PARKS WITHIN THE CITY
19:33:15  THAT WE WORK WITH FOR EAST BAY REGIONAL PARK DISTRICT.

19:33:18 NEXT SLIDE, PLEASE.
THE
19:33:22  TIMELINE OF WHAT WE'VE  WORKED ON OVER MANY YEARS NOW HAS BEEN REALLY
19:33:26  SINCE WE BEGAN IN
19:33:30  2016, WHEN WE PUT THE PERMIT PARKING TOGETHER, UNTIL THE POINT WHERE WE
19:33:33  BEGAN THE LEASE NEGOTIATION IN
19:33:37  2019.
SOME OF IT WAS DELAYED IN 2020 DUE TO THE PANDEMIC
19:33:41  AND WE FOCUSED ON A MONTH TO MONTH LEASE STARTING IN JULY OF
19:33:44  2020 AS I JUST MENTIONED.
THE CITY COUNCIL DIRECTED US TO WORK TOWARDS DEVELOP
19:33:47 ING THE LONG TERM LEASE
19:33:50  ON DECEMBER 15TH OF 2020, AT WHICH POINT WHEN WE
19:33:54  AGREED UPON THINGS, WE STARTED WANTING
19:33:57  TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HEARD ALL THE ISSUES FROM THE COMMUNITY.
WE HELD A COMMUNITY
19:34:00  MEETING ON AUGUST 10TH
19:34:04 , THEN THE PROPOSED LEASE WAS REVIEWED AT THE LIAISON COMMUNITY
19:34:07  THAT THE CITY AND EAST BAY REGIONAL PARKS DISTRICT STAFF
19:34:10  HELD TOGETHER ON OCTOBER 14TH, 2021.
AT THAT
19:34:13  POINT WE REFINED THE AGREEMENT AND WE BROUGHT BEFORE THE EAST BAY REGIONAL
19:34:17  PARK BOARD LAST TUESDAY ON NOVEMBER
19:34:20  2ND AND THEY UNANIMOUSLY
19:34:23  APPROVED THE LEASE AGREEMENT AT A VOTE OF
19:34:26   5-0.
TWO OF THE BOARD MEMBERS WERE ABSENT THAT EVENING.

19:34:29 I WANT TO MAKE PARTICULAR NOTE THAT EVENING LAST WEEK THAT
19:34:33  THEY IDENTIFIED VERY SPECIFICALLY THAT THEY ARE NO LONGER
19:34:36  PURSUING THE 300 PARKING LOT PROJECT AT
19:34:39  STANFORD AVENUE DUE TO LIMITED RESOURCES.
AND THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE
19:34:42  I KNOW THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO THE COMMUNITY AND
19:34:45  ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT THEY'VE BEEN VERY CONCERNED ABOUT OVER THE YEARS
19:34:49 .
AND THEN TONIGHT WE'RE BRING
19:34:52 ING FORTH TO YOU THE CONTINUED DIALOGUE AROUND THE LEASE AGREEMENT
19:34:55  AND OUR RECOMMENDATION FOR YOUR APPROVAL THIS EVENING
19:34:58 .

19:35:03 THERE'S TWO AREAS THAT WE HAVE, AND I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT BOTH OF THEM
19:35:07 .
ONE IS HOW WE HAVE -- WHICH AGENCIES HAVE OVERSIGHT OVER
19:35:10  WHICH COMPONENTS.
SO THE CITY OF FREMONT REALLY HAS BEEN
19:35:13  FOCUSING ON THE PERMIT PARKING.
AGAIN, THOSE
19:35:16  150 PARKING SPACES, AND
19:35:19  ISSUES AROUND CRIME, NEIGHBORHOOD ISSUES
19:35:22 , EMERGENCY AND SAFETY RESPONSE AND MUTUAL
19:35:25  AID THAT HAPPENS IN OUR GREATER COMMUNITY,
19:35:29  AND THEN EAST BAY REGIONAL PARK DISTRICT REALLY FOCUSES
19:35:33  INSIDE THE LEASED SPACE AREA AT FACILITY MAINTENANCE,
19:35:36  OPERATIONS AND PATROL AND RESOURCE MANAGEMENT.
I'M GOING TO TALK A
19:35:39  LITTLE BIT ABOUT THOSE ON THE NEXT SLIDE
19:35:42 .

19:35:47 SO EAST BAY REGIONAL PARK'S RESPONSIBILITY REALLY FOCUSES
19:35:50  AROUND THE AREAS INSIDE THE LEASED SPACE.

19:35:53 AND I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU FIRST OF ALL SOME OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD
19:35:56  ISSUES THAT WE HAVE BEEN HEARING TOGETHER
19:36:00 , AND ALSO TO SHARE WITH YOU WHAT EFFORTS HAVE BEEN MADE TOWARD THESE
19:36:03  ISSUES, BUT ALSO TO IDENTIFY THE FACT THAT AS WE DISCUSS
19:36:07  OPERATIONAL ISSUES, WE REALLY DETERMINED COLLECTIVELY THAT THOSE
19:36:10  SHOULD NOT BE INCLUDED IN THE LEASE AGREEMENT.
SO I WANTED TO
19:36:13  MAKE SURE THAT WE CLARIFIED THAT UP FRONT TONIGHT
19:36:17 .
ONE IS AROUND THE OPERATING HOURS.
THE COMMUNITY WOULD LIKE TO
19:36:20  SEE THOSE BE PERMANENT AND CONSISTENT WITH OTHER NEIGHBORHOOD STAGING AREAS.

19:36:23 THE COMMUNITY HAS IDENTIFIED THAT THERE'S NOT
19:36:27  ENOUGH CURFEW HOURS OF PATROL OUTSIDE OF THE
19:36:30  CURFEW HOURS.
THEY'D LIKE TO SEE HIGHER FENCING
19:36:33  AT THE TRAILHEAD AND AUTOMATIC GATES.
THEY'RE CONCERNED ABOUT
19:36:36  BEING ABLE TO CLOSE THE
19:36:40  SITE ON RED FLAG MORNING DAYS.
THEY'RE CONCERNED ABOUT
19:36:44  ILLEGAL TRAILS NEEDING ADDITIONAL RESTORATION AND HIKER NUMBERS
19:36:47  NEEDING TO BE REDUCED, AND MANAGING THAT MORE EFFECTIVELY
19:36:50 .
THE COMMUNITY HAS ALSO IDENTIFIED FOR
19:36:53  EAST BAY REGIONAL PARKS THE NEED FOR FREE OR REDUCED PARKING
19:36:56  FEES AT OHLONE TRAIL SO THAT PERHAPS THAT WOULD BE
19:37:00  AN INCENTIVE FOR RESIDENTS
19:37:03  OR CUSTOMERS TO GO TO THE OHLONE TRAILHEAD.
THE
19:37:06  NEED FOR FUNDING CAPITAL PROJECTS AT OHLONE
19:37:09  TRAILHEAD FIRST BEFORE THEY COME FOR ANY REQUESTS TO
19:37:12  THE STANFORD LOT, AND THEN REQUESTING REMOVAL
19:37:15  OF ANY MENTION OF STANFORD STAGING AREA ACROSS ANY
19:37:19  COMMUNICATION PLATFORMS HAS ALSO BEEN A REQUEST.
SO WE'RE
19:37:22  IDENTIFYING THOSE TONIGHT AS ISSUES THAT EAST BAY
19:37:25  REGIONAL PARKS HAS HEARD ABOUT, BUT I ALSO WANTED TO SHARE WHAT EFFORTS
19:37:28  HAVE BEEN MADE BY EAST BAY REGIONAL PARKS.
SO
19:37:31  IN THEIR EFFORTS, THEY HAVE ADJUSTED IN
19:37:35  2014, THEY ADJUSTED THE OPERATING HOURS WHILE THE PILOT
19:37:38  PERMIT PARKING PROGRAM WAS BEING IMPLEMENTED.
THEY FULLY FUNDED
19:37:41  THE STARTUP OF THE PILOT PERMIT PARKING PROGRAM FOR THE CITY
19:37:45 .
THEY HAD THEIR INITIAL ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS DURING THE PILOT
19:37:48  PERMIT PARKING PROGRAM.
THEY ATTENDED AND SUPPORTED
19:37:52  COMMUNITY MEETINGS AND OUTREACH EFFORTS, ESPECIALLY IN THE EARLY
19:37:55  DAYS.
AND THEY PROVIDED CRIME AND CONTINUE TO PROVIDE
19:37:58  CRIME AND INVESTIGATION SUPPORT AS NEEDED.

19:38:02 THEY ADDED SIGNAGE ON RESPECT THE
19:38:05  NEIGHBORHOOD, THAT STILL SITS UP ON A FRAMES THERE IN THE
19:38:08  NEIGHBORHOOD TODAY AND UP ON THE STANFORD STAGING AREA
19:38:11 .
THEY HAVE ADDED SIGNAGE ON MISSION BOULEVARD THAT'S
19:38:14  CLOSER TO OHLONE PARKING THAT IDENTIFIES THE MISSION PEAK REGIONAL
19:38:18  PARK ACCESS LOCATION TO PARK AT OHLONE COLLEGE.

19:38:21 THEY'VE ESTABLISHED OHLONE COLLEGE PARTNERSHIP FOR STAGING
19:38:24  AREA AND USE OF THE PARKING LOT.
THEY
19:38:28  INSTALLED PORT-A-POTTIES AND WATER FOUNTAINS AT THE
19:38:31  OHLONE ENTRANCE.
THERE'S ALSO PICNIC AREAS AS YOU WALK
19:38:34  UP THROUGH THE OHLONE ENTRANCE AS YOU
19:38:37  HIKE INTO THE PARK.
THEY HAVE IDENTIFIED
19:38:40  OHLONE COLLEGE AS THE MAIN TRAIL ENTRANCE
19:38:44  POINT AND PARKING, AND IT'S ALSO ON THEIR WEBSITE
19:38:47  AND IN THEIR WAYFINDING MATERIALS AS WELL
19:38:50  AT OHLONE COLLEGE.
THERE'S ALSO A LOVELY
19:38:53  VIDEO IF YOU'VE NOT SEEN IT ON THEIR WEBSITE THAT TALKS ABOUT HOW TO ENJOY
19:38:57  OHLONE -- THE OHLONE COLLEGE
19:39:00  ENTRANCE AND WHAT THE TRAIL IS LIKE AS YOU VISIT THE OHLONE
19:39:03  ENTRANCE UP TO MISSION PEAK.

19:39:08 VOLUNTEER PROJECTS ON THE TRAILS ON A REGULAR BASIS.

19:39:12 THEY ANNUALLY FUND $400,000 IN OPERATING
19:39:15  EXPENSES THAT FREMONT RESIDENTS HELP PAY FOR ALONG
19:39:18  WITH FUNDING THE OTHER SEVEN PARKS IN OUR CITY.

19:39:22 THEY HAVE MAINTENANCE AND OPERATION OF THE LEASED AREA AND THAT IS
19:39:26  CONSISTENT WITH ALL OF THEIR OTHER LEASED
19:39:30  AGREEMENTS THAT THEY HAVE IN OTHER EAST BAY REGIONAL PARKS AND I DO
19:39:34  WANT TO NOTE THAT THEY HAVE -- THEY WORK IN
19:39:37  33 CITIES AND TWO COUNTIES, AND WE
19:39:40  ARE SIMILARLY IN THE FACT THAT WHEN SOMEONE WOULD LOOK AT SOMETHING WE
19:39:44  WANT TO DO IN OUR PARKS, WE REALLY
19:39:47  DO ACKNOWLEDGE THE EQUITY
19:39:50  ISSUES THAT THEY HAVE TO LOOK AT ALL OF THEIR PARKS THROUGHOUT THE SYSTEM JUST
19:39:53  LIKE WE WOULD LOOK AT ALL OF OUR PARKS IN OUR PARK SYSTEM FOR OUR
19:39:57  62 PARKS IN MAKING A DECISION.
WHICH IS WHY
19:40:01  OPERATIONAL ISSUES ARE NOT INCLUDED IN OUR LEASE AGREEMENT.

19:40:07 THE CITY RESPONSIBILITIES, WE ALSO HEARD CONCERNS THAT THE CITY NEEDS
19:40:10  TO ADDRESS.
SPECIFICALLY WE
19:40:14  HEARD ISSUES REGARDING QUALITY OF LIFE ISSUES AROUND TRASH
19:40:17 , AROUND NOISE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD, AND HOW WE NEED
19:40:20  TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES.
THERE ARE ALSO
19:40:23  CONCERNS ABOUT PUBLIC SAFETY AROUND TRAFFIC AND
19:40:26  PARKING AND PARKING IMPACTS THAT DAY BY DAY, WHEN NEIGHBORS
19:40:29  GO THROUGH THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND
19:40:32  PARKING THERE, THAT IT'S DIFFICULT TO LIVE IN A COMMUNITY WHEN YOU HAVE PEOPLE GOING UP TO
19:40:35  EAST BAY REGIONAL PARKS EVERY DAY AND THE
19:40:39  VOLUME OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GOING UP INTO THE
19:40:42  MISSION PEAK.
ALSO THEY'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THE CITYWIDE
19:40:46  RESPONSE BY OUR POLICE AND FIRE.
THEY'RE CONCERNED
19:40:49  ABOUT THEFT AND BREAK-INS AND THE CRIME LEVEL.

19:40:52 AND THEY'RE ALSO REQUESTING INSTALLATION OF NEIGHBORHOOD
19:40:55  CAMERAS.
I DO WANT TO NOTE SOME OF THE CITY EFFORTS THAT WE'VE
19:40:59  ALSO COMPLETED OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS.

19:41:02 ONE IS THAT WE PARTNERED WITH EAST BAY REGIONAL PARKS TO ESTABLISH THE
19:41:05  PILOT PERMIT PARKING PROGRAM.
WE PROVIDED TRAFFIC L
19:41:08 ED BOARDS ALONG THE WAY AS
19:41:11  DIFFERENT DIRECTIONAL NEEDS WERE PROVIDED.

19:41:15 WE EXTENDED THE PERMIT PARKING PROGRAM UNTIL THE CITYWIDE PROGRAM
19:41:18  WAS ESTABLISHED JUST THIS PAST YEAR
19:41:21 .
WE ADDED ENHANCED CROSSWALKS.
WE
19:41:24  ADDED SUPPLEMENTAL SIGNAGE THROUGHOUT
19:41:27  THE NEIGHBORHOOD.
WE NOTIFIED
19:41:30  NEIGHBORHOOD WHEN THERE'S PROPOSED HOURS CHANGED A COUPLE YEARS
19:41:33  AGO WITH EAST BAY REGIONAL PARKS, AND WE'VE  OFFERED
19:41:37  TO DISCUSS ADDING TRASH RECEPTACLES IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD
19:41:40  AS PART OF OUR CITY EFFORTS.
WITH THAT, I'M GOING TO
19:41:43  TURN IT OVER NOW TO CHIEF SEAN WASHINGTON TO SPEAK A
19:41:46  LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE PUBLIC SAFETY ISSUES THAT
19:41:49  HAVE OCCURRED TO DATE, AND HIS REVIEW OF THE
19:41:52  DATA TO DATE.
>> CHIEF
19:41:55  WASHINGTON:  WELL, THANK YOU, SUZANNE.
GOOD EVENING,
19:41:59  MAYOR, COUNCILMEMBER, CITY MANAGER, CITY STAFF AND OUR COMMUNITY.

19:42:02 THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO BE HERE TONIGHT.
SO
19:42:05  IN PREPARATION FOR THIS DISCUSSION, I ASKED MY STAFF
19:42:08  TO REFRESH OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE CRIMINAL ACTIVITY
19:42:11  ASSOCIATED WITH THE MISSION PEAK AREA
19:42:14 , AND WE FELT THIS INFORMATION WOULD BE USEFUL
19:42:18  TONIGHT DURING THIS DISCUSSION.
SOME OF YOU MIGHT
19:42:21  REMEMBER THAT SEVERAL MONTHS AGO, WE STUDIED THE DATA AND
19:42:24  DISCUSSED IT AT A COMMUNITY MEETING AFTER LISTENING TO COMMUNITY CONCERN
19:42:28 S REGARDING CRIME.

19:42:32 OUR DEPARTMENT WILL CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON THE SAFETY OF OUR COMMUNITY.
THAT REMAINS
19:42:35  UNCHANGED.
BUT FOR CONTEXT, WE COLLECTED
19:42:39  INFORMATION FROM AN AREA WHERE WE FELT
19:42:43  WAS LIKELY IMPACTED BY VISITORS TO
19:42:46  THE PARK.
SO WA WE DID IS WE STUDIED THE
19:42:49  AREA OF MISSION, STANFORD, VINEYARD AND
19:42:52  ANTELOPE, AND WE BUILT A BOX AROUND THAT AREA AS
19:42:55  AN AREA WE FELT LIKELY HAD VISITORS PARKING
19:42:59  AND VISITING THE MISSION PEAK AREA.
SO WE USE
19:43:02  THIS AS OUR PERIMETER TO GATHER DATA FOR
19:43:05  TONIGHT'S PRESENTATION.

19:43:10 CRIMES OR CITATIONS OCCURRING INSIDE OF THE PARK ARE NOT REFLECTED IN
19:43:14  THIS DATA, AND I WOULD REFER TO EAST BAY REGIONAL PARK POLICE FOR
19:43:17  THAT INFORMATION IF AVAILABLE.
SO WE REVIEW
19:43:20 ED DATA OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS AND I WANT TO
19:43:23  EXPRESS THAT ALTHOUGH I WILL BE SPEAKING IN GENERAL TERMS
19:43:26  ABOUT THE NUMBER OF CRIMES
19:43:29 , I RECOGNIZE AND RESPECT THAT EACH VICTIM IS
19:43:33  IMPORTANT AND EACH CRIME IS SIGNIFICANT, SO
19:43:36  I DON'T WANT TO COMMUNICATE THAT WHAT I
19:43:40  PROFESSIONALLY PERCEIVE AS A LOW CRIME AREA IS LESS IMPORTANT TO
19:43:43  OUR DEPARTMENT OR THE IMPACT
19:43:46  TO THE COMMUNITY.
SO LET'S START WITH CALLS FOR SERVICE.

19:43:50 THE MAIN CALL FOR SERVICE LOGGED BY OUR DEPARTMENT IS MUNICIPAL
19:43:53  CODE ENFORCEMENT AND VIOLATIONS.
THESE CALLS
19:43:57  ARE INITIATED BY COMMUNITY MEMBERS OR PROACTIVELY AS TIME PERMITS, WHEN
19:44:00  WE ARE ABLE TO WORK THE AREA.

19:44:05 SO IN FIVE YEARS, WE HAD ABOUT 600 CALLS FOR
19:44:08  SERVICE IN THAT PARTICULAR AREA AND THAT'S FROM 2016 TO
19:44:11  2021.
THE NEXT HIGH
19:44:15 EST CALL VOLUME IN THIS PARTICULAR
19:44:18  AREA WERE RESIDENTIAL ALARMS AND THAT TOTALED ABOUT 150
19:44:21  OVER THAT FIVE-YEAR SPAN.
AND MOST OF THOSE ALARMS
19:44:25  WERE FALSE ALARMS.
REPORTS OF
19:44:28  CRIMINAL ACTIVITY.
THE NUMBER OF CRIME REPORTS IN THIS AREA HAS DECREASED
19:44:33  STEADILY FROM 2016 TO
19:44:36  2020.
WE
19:44:39  HAVE SEEN A SLIGHT INCREASE IN CRIME REPORTS IN THIS AREA FOR
19:44:42  2021 AS COMPARED TO 2020.
HOWEVER, THE INCREASE
19:44:46  IS CONSISTENT WITH INCREASES WE ARE SEEING THROUGHOUT
19:44:49  THE CITY AND THE REGION AND IS STILL SIGNIFICANTLY
19:44:52  LESS THAN WHAT WE HAVE EXPERIENCED IN YEARS PAST
19:44:56 .
MOVING ON TO CRIMES, AUTOMOBILE BURGLAR
19:44:59 IES ARE BY FAR THE MOST PREVALENT CRIME.
HOWEVER,
19:45:02  WE REPORTED 87 IN THE TIME
19:45:06  SPAN BETWEEN 2016 AND 2021.

19:45:12 IN 2016, WE HAD 15 OF THESE CRIMES.
IN 2017, WE HAD
19:45:16  19.
IN 2018, WE HAD
19:45:19  24.
IN 2019, WE HAD
19:45:22  13.
AND THEN 2020, WE HAD
19:45:28  4 AND 2021 TO DATE, WE'VE HAD 12.

19:45:31 FOR CONTEXT, IN 2020, WE HAD
19:45:36  1,451 AUTO BURGLARIES THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE CITY.

19:45:41 IN 2021, SO FAR, WE'VE HAD 12.

19:45:45 STAFF REVIEWED DETAILS OF MANY OF THESE CRIMES AND IT APPEARS
19:45:48  THAT THEY ARE CRIMES OF OPPORTUNITY
19:45:52 .
PERSONS LEAVING VALUABLES IN PLAIN
19:45:55  SIGHT WHERE THIEVES LIKELY HIKERS WITH SOME
19:45:58  IMPACT TO OUR RESIDENTS AS WELL, SO THESE ARE ITEMS
19:46:01  BEING LEFT IN VEHICLES AND THEY'RE CRIMES FOR
19:46:04  OPPORTUNITY WHEN OUR CRIMINALS ARE GOING TO BREAK INTO
19:46:08  THE VEHICLES.
SO OUR ASSESSMENT DOES NOT INDICATE
19:46:11  ANY UNUSUAL SPIKE OR DISPROPORTIONATE AMOUNT OF CRIME IN THIS PARTICULAR
19:46:15  AREA, WHICH REMAINS CONSISTENT WITH WHAT WE
19:46:18  DISCOVERED SEVERAL MONTHS AGO WHEN WE FIRST REVIEWED THIS
19:46:22   DATA.
OUR GOAL WHERE WE MADE
19:46:25  TO LOWER CRIME LEVELS EVEN FURTHER, WHEN REASONABLY
19:46:28  POSSIBLE GIVEN THE LIMITED RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE.
WE
19:46:32  WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR AND ASSESS THIS AREA MOVING FORWARD AND MAKE
19:46:35  ADJUSTMENTS WHEN APPROPRIATE, BALANCING THE NEED TO
19:46:38  ADDRESS SIMILAR ISSUES ACROSS OUR GREAT CITY.

19:46:42 WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH OUR COMMUNITY TO MITIGATE THE
19:46:46  IMPACT OF ALL CRIMES AND ARE CONSIDERING THE USE OF
19:46:50  CAMERAS, SIGNAGE AND CONTINUED COOPERATION AND ENGAGEMENT EFFORTS WITH
19:46:53  OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS LIVING IN THIS AREA.
WE ALSO
19:46:56  CONTINUE A STRONG PARTNERSHIP WITH EAST BAY REGIONAL PARK POLICE AND
19:46:59  I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THAT PARTNERSHIP.

19:47:04 SO THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO HAVE A FEW MINUTE JUST TO PROVIDE SOME INFORMATION
19:47:07   REGARDING CRIME IN THIS PARTICULAR AREA.
AND NOW I WILL TURN
19:47:10  IT OVER TO DEPUTY FIRE CHIEF DI
19:47:13 AZ.
>> GOOD EVENING, MAYOR, COUNCIL, CITY
19:47:16  ADMINISTRATOR, CITY LEADERSHIP AND CITIZENS OF FREMONT.
THANK
19:47:19  YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE THIS EVENING.

19:47:23 I'M HERE REPRESENTING THE FIRE CHIEF AND ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT WAS ASK
19:47:27 ED OF US WAS TO BE ABLE
19:47:30  TO IDENTIFY RESOURCE ALLEGATIONS AND TO
19:47:34  LOOK AT DATA FROM OUR FIRE E
19:47:37 MS PROGRAM.
IN DOING SO
19:47:40 , WE LOOKED AT DATA FROM JANUARY 1ST OF
19:47:45  2016 UNTIL NOVEMBER 2ND OF
19:47:49  2016.
AND WHAT
19:47:53  WE'VE DETERMINED IS, THE NUMBER OF CALLS FOR
19:47:56  SERVICE SINCE 2016 HAS BEEN 215
19:47:59  CALLS, AN AVERAGE OF 43 CALLS PER
19:48:03  YEAR, WITH A LARGE NUMBER OF CALLS OCCURRING DURING
19:48:06  THE WARMER MONTHS AND ON THE WEEKENDS
19:48:09 .
THE VAST MAJORITY OF CALLS THAT WE'VE RECEIVE
19:48:12 ED HAVE BEEN MEDICAL CALLS,
19:48:16  AND DURING THOSE MEDICAL CALLS, WE HAVE DISPATCH
19:48:20 ED TWO ENGINE COMPANIES, WHICH MOST OF THE
19:48:23  TIME WHEN WE'RE GOING TO MISSION PEAK, DUE
19:48:26  TO ACCESS AND LOCATION
19:48:31  AND COMMUNICATION WITH THE REPORTING PARTY, SOMETIMES THAT EXTENDS OUR RESPONSE
19:48:34  TIME.
SO WHETHER IT'S A MEDICAL CALL OR A
19:48:37  VEGETATION FIRE.
WE ALSO LOOKED AT
19:48:41  WHAT THE SIMILAR
19:48:45  RESPONSES ARE FOR CITIES SUCH AS OAKLAND
19:48:49  AND SAN JOSÉ AND DETERMINED THAT BASED
19:48:52  ON THE 43 CALLS PER YEAR THAT WE
19:48:55  HAVE, THEY'RE SIMILAR TO OTHER REGIONAL
19:48:59  PARK RESPONSES.

19:49:03 WE FURTHER DEL
19:49:06 VED INTO OUR DATA BY LOOKING AT HOW MANY CALLS WE'VE
19:49:09  HAD DURING NON-OPERATING HOURS.

19:49:13 SO FROM JANUARY OF 2016 TO
19:49:16  NOVEMBER 2ND OF 2021,
19:49:20  WE IDENTIFIED THERE WERE NINE CALLS FOR SERVICE, AND
19:49:23  THE NATURE OF THE CALLS ARE AS FOLLOWS:  WE
19:49:26  HAD TWO MEDICAL CALLS, WE HAD TWO
19:49:29  HIKERS THAT WERE LOST, WE HAD
19:49:32  THREE CALLS IN WHICH WE WERE CANCELED WHILE RESPOND
19:49:36 ING.
ONE SMOKE SCARE, AND WE HAD ONE
19:49:39  VEGETATION FIRE.
THE VEGETATION FIRE HAPPENED IN
19:49:42  MAY, AND DURING A VEGETATION FIRE, OFTENTIMES
19:49:46  BECAUSE IT'S IN A MUTUAL THREAT ZONE, YOU'LL
19:49:49  END UP HAVING RESOURCES FROM FREMONT
19:49:52  FIRE, FROM CAL FIRE, AS WELL AS EAST BAY
19:49:55  REGIONAL PARKS.
WITH REGARDS TO
19:49:59  INCIDENTS THAT MAY REQUIRE US TO BE
19:50:02  ON SEEN FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME
19:50:05 , WHAT WE TEND TO DO IS THAT WE MOVE UP COMPANIES TO
19:50:09  MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE CITY COVERAGE, SO THAT THE REST OF THE CITY
19:50:12  IS -- THE CITIZENS ARE GETTING THE RESOURCES THAT THEY'RE REQUIRED SHOULD
19:50:15  THERE BE AN EXTENDED INCIDENT.
THERE ARE TIMES
19:50:19  IN WHICH IF THE INCIDENT REQUIRES MORE RESOURCES
19:50:22  FROM FREMONT, WE'LL CALL FOR MUTUAL AID SO WE HAVE
19:50:26   NEIGHBORING AGENCIES IN WHICH WE HAVE
19:50:29  RELATIONSHIPS WITH THEM AND WE PULL TRIGGERS AND THOSE TRIGGERS
19:50:32  IDENTIFY WHEN THERE'S A
19:50:35  NEED FOR US TO BRING RESOURCES TO EITHER GO TO THE INCIDENT OR TO
19:50:39  COVER THE CITY OF FREMONT
19:50:42  AND MAKE SURE THE CITIZENS ARE RECEIVING THE SERVICES THAT THEY NEED.

19:50:46 AT THIS POINT, I'M OPEN TO ANY QUESTIONS
19:50:50 .

19:50:55 >> Ms. Wolf: WHICH WILL CONTINUE THE REST OF THE PRESENTATION AND THEN BE AVAILABLE FOR ANY
19:50:58  QUESTIONS FROM THE MAYOR AND COUNCIL AT THE END OF THE PRESENTATION
19:51:01 .
THE NEXT -- I WANT TO THANK
19:51:04  THE CHIEF AND THE DEPUTY CHIEF FOR JOINING US THIS EVENING
19:51:07  THOUGH AND BEING AVAILABLE FOR  QUESTIONS THROUGHOUT THE  EVENING.

19:51:14 THE FINAL SLIDE THIS EVENING IS THE OVERVIEW OF OUR PROPOSED LEASE AGREEMENT, WHICH IS
19:51:17  IN FRONT OF US, AND WE WILL HAVE
19:51:22  -- THESE COMPONENTS ARE INCLUDED IN THE LEASE AGREEMENT THAT WE
19:51:25  FELT VERY IMPORTANT TO BE INCLUDED.
ONE WAS A LONGER LEASE AGREEMENT
19:51:29  FOR 25 YEARS, WHICH WOULD GO THROUGH JULY 1ST,
19:51:33  2046, WITH THE ADDITIONAL 25-YEAR OPTION
19:51:37  AVAILABLE.
BUT TO NOTE THAT WE HAVE THE ABILITY
19:51:40  TO STOP THE AGREEMENT AT ANY TIME IF WE DEEM
19:51:43  IT NEEDED ANY MONTH OF THE YEAR.

19:51:47 THE STAGING AREA, WE WOULD MAKE IMPROVEMENTS BUT IT'S NOT REQUIRED TO DO SO
19:51:50 .
ALL REQUESTED IMPROVEMENTS MUST BE APPROVED OR DENIED
19:51:54  BY THE CITY.
SO IF THERE ARE
19:51:58  NON-PERMITTED
19:52:01  IMPROVEMENTS
19:52:05  SUCH AS SLURRY  SEALS,
19:52:08  RETAINING WALL IMPROVEMENT, THOSE
19:52:11  ITEMS WOULD BE UNDER 30 DAYS, THEY WERE A LARGER CAPITAL
19:52:15  IMPROVEMENT, THE CITY WOULD HAVE A RIGHT TO I A PROVE IT, DENY
19:52:18  IT OR EXTEND IT UP TO 60 DAYS.
WE BOTH
19:52:21  BELIEVE THAT'S A REASONABLE TIME FRAME TO ALLOW US TO KNOW WHETHER WE
19:52:24  THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT COULD GO FORWARD OR NOT.
BOTH AGENC
19:52:27 IES ARE CONTINUED AND CONTINUE TO PROMOTE THE
19:52:30  MAIN TRAIL ACCESS POINT AND
19:52:35  PARKING LOT OF OHLONE
19:52:39  COLLEGE.
PART OF THAT IS ALSO TO UNDERSTAND THAT ONE OF THE KEY ISSUES HERE
19:52:42  IS GOOGLE MAPS AND HOW THEY PROMOTE
19:52:46  STANFORD AVENUE AS THE PRIMARY LOCATION WHEN YOU'RE
19:52:49  ON, SO WE CAN
19:52:52  CONTINUE TO ENCOURAGE THOSE APPS TO CONTINUE TO MOVE IT TOWARDS OWE CLOA KNEE
19:52:56  COLLEGE.
WE'RE BOTH GOING TO WORK TOWARDS DOING THAT
19:52:59  AS WELL.
AGAIN OPERATIONAL OVERSIGHT WE BELIEVE BELONGS WITHIN EAST
19:53:02  BAY REGIONAL PARKS.
THEY WOULD SET THE OPERATING
19:53:05  HOURS, BUT TO NOTE THAT IF THEY DO WANT TO
19:53:09  CHANGE ANY OF THE OPERATING HOURS, THE KEY THING HERE IS THAT THE
19:53:12  THE CITY WOULD BE NOTIFIED 30 DAYS IN ADVANCE.
IT WOULD GIVE US
19:53:16  THE OPPORTUNITY TO INFORM ALL OF THE COMMUNITY MEMBERS
19:53:19  AND OUR INTERESTED PARTIES LIST.
WE CAN HOLD THE COMMUNITY MEETING
19:53:22  BETWEEN OUR GENERAL MANAGERS AND OUR CITY MANAGER,
19:53:26  AND TO HAVE THE COMMUNITY COMMENT AT THE COMMITTEE MEETING
19:53:30  MEETING, AT WHICH TIME THE DECISION WOULD BE MADE.

19:53:33 THIS IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TO OUR COMMUNITY, WHICH WE HEARD LOUD AND
19:53:36  CLEAR, AND WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAD
19:53:40  POINTS IN WHICH WE COULD INFORM THE COMMUNITY SO THAT THEY WOULD KNOW HOW
19:53:43  TO GET AHOLD AND BE IN FRONT OF EAST BAY REGIONAL
19:53:46  PARKS APPROPRIATELY.
EAST BAY
19:53:49  REGIONAL PARKS INCLUDED IN THE LEASE THIS TIME IS
19:53:52  THAT THEIR MAINTENANCE EFFORTS WOULD BE AT THE SAME LEVEL AS OTHER
19:53:55  EAST BAY REGION NAT PARKS THROUGHOUT THE DISTRICT.

19:53:59 AGAIN KNOWING THAT OUR FUNDING SOURCES CHANGE YEAR TO YEAR, WE
19:54:02  DID NOT SET THE STANDARD PER SE BUT UNDERSTAND THAT THAT
19:54:05  CHANGES ON AN ONGOING BASIS BUT WHATEVER THE STANDARD
19:54:08  IS AT OTHER PARKS, THEY WOULD
19:54:13  HAVE HERE AS WELL.
AND THE FINAL ITEM UNDER THE OPERATIONAL
19:54:16  OVERSIGHT IS THAT THEY WOULD PROVIDE THE PATROL OF THE LEASED AREA,
19:54:20  43 SPACES, AND THAT WE PROVIDE THE PATROL OF THE
19:54:23  NEIGHBORHOOD PERMIT PARKING AREA, WHICH IS APPROXIMATELY
19:54:27  150 SPACES, AND THAT, AGAIN, THEY PROVIDE
19:54:30  THE POLICE AND FIRE PROTECTION AS THEY DO AT OTHER EAST
19:54:33  BAY REGIONAL PARKS AND THAT WE ARE CONTINUING TO
19:54:37  COLLABORATE CLOSELY.
I WILL SAY AGAIN, THERE'VE BEEN MANY QUESTION
19:54:40 S ASKED ABOUT OUR COLLABORATION.
WE
19:54:43  WORK VERY CLOSELY ON ALL OF THE PARKS IN THE
19:54:47  CITY OF FREMONT AND I'M APPRECIATIVE OF THE EFFORTS OF JIM AND THE
19:54:50  OPERATIONS TEAM THAT WE WORK WITH.
I JUST WANTED TO MAKE A PUBLIC NOTE OF THAT.

19:54:53 AND THAT CITY CONTINUES TO PROVIDE
19:54:56  MUTUAL AID AS REQUESTED, AS NOTED BY OUR FIRE CHIEF THIS EVENING.

19:54:59 WITH THAT, THAT'S THE CONCLUSION OF OUR PUBLIC
19:55:03  PRESENTATION AND WE'RE HAPPY, AGAIN, ALL OF
19:55:06  US HERE THIS EVENING, INCLUDING ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU
19:55:09  MAY HAVE FOR CAPTAIN
19:55:12  LANCE BREDE AND ASSISTANT GENERAL
19:55:16  MANAGER JIM O'CONNOR.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENT TAITION.

19:55:19  PRESENTATION.
WE'LL START WITH THE
19:55:22  QUESTIONS FROM OUR COUNCILMEMBERS, SO CLARIFY
19:55:25 ING QUESTIONS FROM THE COUNCIL.
WE'LL BEGIN WITH COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN
19:55:29 , PLEASE.
>> FOR THE PRESENTATION,
19:55:32  I'M SURPRISED THAT THE QUESTION
19:55:35  OF THE SEEMING CONTRADICTION
19:55:39  BETWEEN DIFFERENT INTERPRETATIONS OF THE LEASE
19:55:44  WASN'T MENTIONED IN THE PRESENTATION.
I FEEL THE NEED TO
19:55:48  READ A LITTLE EXCERPT OF WHAT WAS DISCUSSED AT THE EAST BAY
19:55:51  REGIONAL PARKS BOARD MEETING.
19:55:58 
SO DIRECTOR COFFEE SAID -- AND THIS IS RELATED TO SOMETHING THAT
19:56:01  HAPPENED LAST MAY.
I'M NOT SURE IF EVERYONE REMEMBERS,
19:56:05  BUT THERE
19:56:09  WAS A PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY THAT LED TO OUR
19:56:12  CHIEF, OUR POLICE CHIEF DECIDING THAT WE
19:56:15  NEEDED TO CLOSE THE ENTRANCE AT STANFORD,
19:56:18  AND IT DID RESULT IN SOME PRETTY UNPLEASANT
19:56:23  INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THE CITY OF FREMONT AND EAST BAY REGIONAL PARK
19:56:27 .
SO AT THE MEETING OF EAST BAY REGIONAL
19:56:31  PARKS BOARD, DIRECTOR  COFF
19:56:34 EY SAID, REGARDING THIS LEASE, THE CITY OF FREMONT EUN LAT RAY
19:56:37 LY TOOK IT UPON ITSELF TO PUT UP A FENCE AND TO BLOCK THE ENTRANCE WITH
19:56:40  A POLICE CAR.
WHAT THEY DID WAS SHAMEFUL, IT WAS
19:56:44  UNLAWFUL, AND I SPENT A GOOD DEAL OF TIME ON THE PHONE
19:56:47  YESTERDAY WITH CAROL VICTOR, OUR COUNSEL
19:56:50 , AND SHE SENT ME A PROVISION THAT HAS BEEN ADDED TO THE
19:56:54  LEASE THAT EXPRESSLY NOW PROVIDES THAT THE PARK
19:56:57  DISTRICT IS SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR OPERATIONS OF THE PARK
19:57:00 .
CITY OF FREMONT DOES NOT HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO
19:57:03  OVERRIDE THAT.
SO
19:57:06  THEN THERE WAS A QUESTION FROM DIRECTOR
19:57:09  LANE:  I WAS CONCERNED AS WELL AND I WANT TO KNOW IF THAT WAS
19:57:12  DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WE HAD IN EARLIER LANGUAGE
19:57:16 .
THEN AGM KEL CH NER FROM THE PARKS DISTRICT
19:57:19  SAID THE SHORT ANSWER IS YES.
THE LEASE WAS NOT CLEAR IN THE PAST
19:57:22 , AND WE HAVE ADDED LANGUAGE TO AFFIRMATIVELY CLARIFY
19:57:25  THAT THE PARK DISTRICT HAS CONTROL OF THE OPERATION OF THE
19:57:28  PARK, WHICH WOULD INCLUDE ANY TEMPORARY CLOSURES OF THE PARK.

19:57:32 AND THEN THE GENERAL COUNSEL SAID, THE
19:57:35  CITY WAS AWARE DURING NEGOTIATIONS THAT THIS WAS A STICKING
19:57:40  POINT, AND THE CLOSURE DIDN'T SIT WELL WITH OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS,
19:57:43  WITH GOOD REASON.
AND SO THE LANGUAGE THAT HAS BEEN NEGOTIATED
19:57:46  TO ADDRESS THIS POINT SAYS THAT SUBJECT TO THE TERMS OF THE LEASE, THE
19:57:49  PARK DISTRICT SHALL HAVE EXCLUSIVE CONTROL OVER
19:57:52  THE PROPERTY AND THE
19:57:56  SOLE AUTHORITY TO MANAGE THE PROPERTY SHOULD THE CLOSURE LIKE WE EXPERIENCED
19:58:00  EVER HAPPEN  AGAIN, AND THE CITY TRIED TO CLOSE THE PARK
19:58:03  AGAIN, WE WOULD HAVE A GOOD
19:58:06  BASIS TO GO SEEK AN INJUNCTION.

19:58:10 AGH KE
19:58:13 LCHNER SAID YES THAT
19:58:16  WAS A HARD FOUGHT POINT -- WHEN I  ASKED
19:58:19  CITY STAFF ABOUT THAT, I WAS TOLD THAT THAT WAS NOT CORRECT.
THAT ACTUALLY
19:58:23  THE CITY'S ACTIONS DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC
19:58:29  WERE COMPLETELY UNRELATED AND THE POLICE
19:58:32  CHIEF DID HAVE AUTHORITY UNDER THE HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE TO DO THE CLOSURE
19:58:35 .
SO THERE'S A REALLY BIG CONTRADICTION BETWEEN WHAT OUR
19:58:38  CITY STAFF IS SAYING AND WHAT THEIR PARK
19:58:41  STAFF IS SAYING AND I DID ASK A QUESTION ABOUT THIS AND I DIDN'T
19:58:44  GET ANY RESPONSE FROM STAFF.
SO I'M REALLY, REALLY SURPRISED
19:58:47  ABOUT THAT AND REALLY CONCERNED FLOO.
19:58:52 .
SO I'D LIKE TO KNOW IF WE HAD ANOTHER
19:58:56  SITUATION WHERE THERE WAS A PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY WHERE OUR POLICE CHIEF OR
19:58:59  FIRE CHIEF OR SOMEONE FROM OUR STAFF FELT THAT IT WAS
19:59:02  IMPORTANT TO CLOSE THE ENTRANCE FOR SOME REASON, WOULD WE OR WOULD
19:59:05  WE NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO DO THAT, OR
19:59:08  WOULD WE BE BROUGHT TO COURT AND HAVE AN INJUNCTION
19:59:12  BROUGHT AGAINST US FOR DOING THAT?

19:59:19 >> Ms. Wolf: I WOULD ASK OUR CITY ATTORNEY DEBRA MARGOLIS OR
19:59:22  BRONWEN LACEY TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION BECAUSE WE BELIEVE
19:59:26   THAT -- AND AGAIN, WE'VE SPOKEN WITH EAST BAY REGIONAL
19:59:29  PARKS, WE ONLY HAVE A PANDEMIC LIKE THIS EVERY HUNDRED
19:59:32  YEARS.
IT WAS VERY CHAOTIC AT THAT TIME, AND
19:59:35  WE TOOK ACTIONS ACCORDING TO THE HEALTH ORDER.
AND THE
19:59:38  ORDER RELATED TO THE PARK IS STILL
19:59:41  UNDER THEIR SOLE AUTHORITY AND WE BELIEVE THAT IS THEIR
19:59:45  SOLE AUTHORITY IN THE PARK SO WE DON'T BELIEVE THEY ARE CONTRADICK
19:59:48 S AT THIS TIME.
>> Councilmember Kassan: I'M SORRY, THERE IS
19:59:51  A CONTRADICTION, THOUGH.
THEY'RE SAYING THAT WE DID NOT HAVE THE AUTHORITY
19:59:54  TO DO THE CLOSURE, AND OUR STAFF SAID YES, WE
19:59:57  DID HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO DO THE CLOSURE.
SO THERE'S AN ABSOLUTE
20:00:01  CONTRADICTION AND I NEED TO KNOW WHO IS CORRECT.

20:00:07 >> City Mgr. Shackelford: BEFORE BRONWEN OR DEBRA CHIME IN
20:00:10  I'D JUST LIKE TO MAKE A COUPLE POINTS.
ONE, WE DID NOT CLOSE THE PARK
20:00:13 , AND AS SUZANNE
20:00:17  STATED IN THE PRESENTATION, WE AND EAST BAY
20:00:20  REGIONAL PARK DISTRICT CONTINUE TO
20:00:23  ENCOURAGE THE USAGE OF THE OHLONE
20:00:27  ENTRANCE.
SO PEOPLE WERE ABLE TO GET INTO THE
20:00:30  PARK VIA THE OHLONE  ENTRANCE.
WE CLOSED THE
20:00:33  STREET, NOT THE PARK.
SO I JUST
20:00:37  WANT TO BE ABSOLUTELY CLEAR ON THAT.

20:00:41 AND AGAIN,
20:00:45  WE WERE RIGHT AT THE BEGINNING OF A MAJOR PANDEMIC, AND WE
20:00:48  HAD A PUBLIC HEALTH ORDER THAT, YOU KNOW,
20:00:51  HAD CERTAIN THINGS IN IT.
THERE WERE A
20:00:54  LOT OF PEOPLE CONTINUING TO USE THE PARK AND USE THAT
20:00:58  ENTRANCE, AND SO WE TOOK AN ACTION FOR
20:01:02  THE PURPOSE OF THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF THE COMMUNITY.

20:01:05 DEBRA?
>> Councilmember Kassan: I UNDERSTAND THAT, BUT I JUST -- I
20:01:08  DON'T FEEL LIKE MY QUESTION IS BEING ADDRESSED.
ALL I DID WAS
20:01:11  READ WORD FOR WORD WHAT THEIR GENERAL
20:01:14  COUNSEL SAID, AND THEN I READ WORD FOR WORD WHAT OUR STAFF
20:01:17  SAID AND THOSE TWO THINGS CONTRADICT EACH OTHER.
SO I JUST NEED TO
20:01:21  KNOW. WHAT IS THE REALITY OF THE
20:01:24  SITUATION.
>> City Mgr. Shackelford: OKAY.
DEBRA WILL ADDRESS THAT SPECIFICALLY
20:01:27 .
THANK YOU.

20:01:31 >> Ms. Margolis: I'M GOING TO TURN IT OVER TO BRONWEN BECAUSE SHE'S BEEN MORE INVOLVED WITH THIS
20:01:34  ISSUE AND SHE CAN EXPLAIN TO YOU
20:01:38 .
>> HI.
BRONWEN LACEY, SENIOR DEPUTY
20:01:41  CITY ATTORNEY.
I'VE BEEN WORKING WITH SUZANNE WOLF ON THIS LEASE AND I ALSO ASSISTED
20:01:45  THE FORMER POLICE CHIEF ON HER ORDER AND HER
20:01:49  DECISION, WHICH WAS MADE SOLELY UNDER THE
20:01:52  COUNTY HEALTH ORDER, AND NOT UNDER THE LEASE.

20:01:56 IN FACT, THE LETTERS THAT THE CHIEF WROTE
20:02:00  TO EAST BAY REGIONAL PARK
20:02:03  DISTRICT WERE SOLELY UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF THE HEALTH AND SAFETY
20:02:07  CODE OF STATE LAW.
WHICH SAYS THAT THE POLICE CHIEF SHALL HAVE
20:02:10  THE AUTHORITY TO ENFORCE THE ORDER OF THE COUNTY HEALTH
20:02:13  OFFICER, WHICH IS WHAT SHE WAS ACTING UNDER.
AND IT HAD
20:02:17  NOTHING TO DO WITH THE LEASE.
IN ADDITION
20:02:20 , IF EAST BAY -- IF THE CITY EVER TOOK SUCH
20:02:23  AN ACTION AGAIN AND EAST BAY DID WANT TO
20:02:27  FILE AN INJUNCTION IN COURT DISPUTING
20:02:30  ACTIONS THAT THE CITY TOOK UNDER THE HEALTH  ORDER, THEY'RE
20:02:33  MORE THAN WELCOME TO DO SO.

20:02:36 BUT AT THE SAME TIME, THAT DID NOT CHANGE THE AUTHORITY THAT
20:02:39  THE POLICE CHIEF HAD UNDER THE HEALTH ORDER.

20:02:44 AND, THEREFORE, UNDER THE CURRENT LEASE THAT WE'RE ASKING YOU TO APPROVE TONIGHT
20:02:47 , EAST BAY STILL HAS THE SOLE
20:02:51  AUTHORITY TO OPERATE THE PARK AND THE CITY DOES
20:02:55  NOT HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO TELL EAST BAY HOW
20:02:58  TO MAINTAIN THE PARK OR TO OPERATE THEIR PARK
20:03:01 .
THAT BEING SAID, WE STILL HAVE
20:03:04  HAVE -- THE CITY
20:03:08  STILL HASTY POLICE POWER UNDER STATE LAW AND UNDER
20:03:11  LOCAL ORDINANCES.
>> Ms. Margolis: THAT WAS THE POINT I WAS GOING TO MAKE, COUNCILMEMBER 
20:03:14 KASSAN.
I THINK WITH RESPECT TO THE LANGUAGE THAT YOU QUOTED, BOTH
20:03:17  SIDES ARE CORRECT.
THE PARK DISTRICT DOES HAVE
20:03:20  THE AUTHORITY OVER THE PARK
20:03:23 , BUT THE CITY STILL DOES HAVE THE AUTHORITY OVER THE STREETS.

20:03:27 >> Councilmember Kassan: I DON'T SEE HOW BOTH SIDES CAN BE SIMULTANEOUSLY
20:03:30  CORRECT.
OUR SIDE IS SAYING THAT WE HAD THE AUTHORITY TO DO THE STREET CLOSURE
20:03:35  UNDER LAW, AND THAT WE DID NOT VIOLATE THE LEASE,
20:03:38  WE DID NOT VIOLATE THE LAW.
AND
20:03:41  THEY'RE
20:03:44  COUNSEL SAYS UNDER THE NEW LEASE, WE WOULD NOT HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO DO THAT.

20:03:49 >> Ms. Margolis: WE DON'T AGREE WITH THAT INTERPRETATION.
>> Councilmember Kassan: OKAY, SO
20:03:52  THERE'S A DISAGREEMENT THEN.
SO I JUST DON'T SEE HOW WE CAN SIGN A LEASE
20:03:55  WHEN THERE'S A CLEAR DISAGREEMENT IN INTERPRETATION.
I THINK
20:03:59  THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT.
WE NEED THE AUTHORITY TO
20:04:02  DO -- TO DEAL WITH PUBLIC EMERGENCIES, AND WE
20:04:05  CAN'T HAVE THIS SITUATION WHERE OUR COUNSEL
20:04:08  IS SAYING ONE THING AND THEIR COUNSEL IS SAYING ANOTHER THING,
20:04:12  AND THE ONLY REASON THE BOARD VOTED UNANIMOUSLY TO ADOPT
20:04:15  THE LEASE WAS BECAUSE THEY WERE ASSURED BY BOTH
20:04:18  ASSISTANT GENERAL MANAGER  KELCHN
20:04:21 ER AND BY THEIR
20:04:26  -- THAT THAT PROVISION IN THE LEASE WOULD PREVENT US FROM EVER AGAIN DOING WHAT THEY
20:04:29  CALLED THE  SHAMEFUL ACT OF CLOSING THE STREET.
SO I
20:04:32  JUST DON'T SEE HOW WE CAN SIGN A LEASE WHEN THERE IS SUCH A
20:04:36  CLEAR MISUNDERSTANDING
20:04:39  OR DIVERGENCE OF UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THE LEASE ACTUALLY MEANS.

20:04:50 I'LL STOP THERE.
THANK YOU.

20:04:54 >> Mayor Mei: VICE MAYOR SHAO, I THINK YOU'RE NEXT FOR CLARIFYING QUESTIONS.

20:04:58 AT THIS TIME.

20:05:02 >> Vice Mayor Shao: SURE.
I'LL START WITH A QUOTE FROM CONFUCIUS.

20:05:06 LIFE IS REALLY SIMPLE BUT WE INSIST ON MAKING IT
20:05:09  COMPLICATED.
I'M NOT SURE WHETHER CONFUCIUS REALLY SAID THAT,
20:05:12  BUT SEEMS LIKE, YOU KNOW, WE'RE DEALING WITH AN ISSUE
20:05:15  THAT MAY OR MAY NOT BE COMPLICATED.
MY
20:05:18  QUESTION IS VERY SIMPLE.
SO IT'S REGARD
20:05:22 ING -- IT ALSO FOR
20:05:26  THE PUBLIC'S SAKE.
IN ARTICLE
20:05:30  13C, AT ANY .30 DAYS WRITTEN
20:05:33  NOTICE BY EITHER OF THE PARTIES,
20:05:36  THAT IS REGARDING THIS LEASE MAY BE TERMINATED.

20:05:39 SO MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT
20:05:45  THE PARK DISTRICT ALREADY GOT THE FUNDING
20:05:49  FOR OPERATING THE PARK.
SO
20:05:53  IF THEY WANT TO TERMINATE THE LEASE
20:05:58  AND KEEP THE MONEY, THEN
20:06:01  THE CITY WOULD BE AT A LOSS.
SO
20:06:05  IS THAT PREVENTABLE OR
20:06:08  -- TO ME, IT SEEMS LIKE THEY HAVE ALL THE
20:06:12  INCENTIVE TO DO SO.
KEEP THE MONEY BUT NOT RUNNING THE
20:06:15  PARK.

20:06:23 >> Ms. Wolf: COUNCILMEMBER SHAO, THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION IN THAT THE TAXPAYER
20:06:26 S PAY EAST BAY REGIONAL PARKS TO RUN AND OPERATE ALL OF THE
20:06:29  PARKS IN FREMONT AS WELL AS ALL THE PARKS IN ALL OF THEIR
20:06:32  CITIES, SO THEY WOULD NOT -- IF WE
20:06:36  CHOSE NOT TO HAVE A LEASE AGREMENT WITH THEM, THEY WOULD TAKE THE
20:06:39  FUNDING FROM THE TAXPAYERS AND USE TO OPERATE ALL OF
20:06:42  THEIR PARKS INDEPENDENT OF THESE 900 ACRES.
THEN
20:06:45  THE CITY WOULD BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR
20:06:48  PAYING FOR THE 900 ACRES TO OPERATE AND/
20:06:51 OR TO MANAGE AND/OR TO CLOSE WHATEVER WE
20:06:54  WOULD DEEM APPROPRIATE, OF WHICH WE DO NOT HAVE ANY IDENTIFIED
20:06:58  FUNDING FOR TODAY IN THE GENERAL FUND.

20:07:06 >> Vice Mayor Shao: THANK YOU.

20:07:09 >> Mayor Mei: NEXT WILL BE COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN.

20:07:12 CLARIFYING QUESTIONS.
>> Councilmember Salwan: THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR.

20:07:17 SO I ALSO HAD A QUESTION RELATED
20:07:21  TO -- THEY MENTIONED
20:07:25  TRUSTEE OR DIRECTOR COFFEY
20:07:28  MADE SOME INFLAMMATORY COMMENTS WHICH WERE
20:07:32  NOT COMMENTS OF A PARTNER BUT MORE OF A -- MORE LITIGIOUS
20:07:35 , AND THEY MENTIONED THAT THEY HAD INSERTED SOME LANGUAGE
20:07:42  LANGE WAJ THAT WOULD SPECIFICALLY PREVENT
20:07:45  THE CITY OF FREMONT FROM EVER CLOSING THE PARK.
SO WHAT SPECIFIC LANGUAGE
20:07:48  IS THAT, AND WHAT ARE WE GIVING UP BY AGREEING TO
20:07:52  THAT LANGUAGE?

20:08:01 >> I CAN ANSWER THAT QUESTION.
SO THEY INSERTED A SMALL
20:08:04  PHRASE THAT SAID -- I THINK IT WAS AN ENTIRE SENTENCE THAT
20:08:07  BASICALLY SAID THAT THE PARK DISTRICT HAD THE SOLE AUTHORITY TO OPERATE
20:08:10  AND MANAGE THE PARK.
THE CITY HAS NEVER DISPUTED THEIR ABILITY
20:08:14  TO OPERATE AND MANAGE THE PARK.
IN FACT, THAT
20:08:17  IS WHY WE LEASE THE PROPERTY TO THEM FOR THEM
20:08:20  TO DO THAT, THEY ARE THE EXPERTS AT THAT.
THAT IS
20:08:23  THEIR SOLE RESPONSIBILITY AS A PARK DISTRICT.

20:08:26 AND SO WE'VE NEVER DISPUTED
20:08:30   THAT.
AND REGARDING THE INCIDENT THAT HAPPENED
20:08:34  IN MAY OF 2020, AGAIN, THAT WASN'T US CLOSING THE PARK,
20:08:37  AS THE CITY MANAGER HAS SAID.
THAT WAS US
20:08:40  CLOSING THE STREET.
NOT THE PARK.
AND THE PARK
20:08:43  WAS STILL OPERATING AND STILL ACCESSIBLE BY THE
20:08:46  PUBLIC JUST FROM OTHER  ENTRANCES.

20:08:50 >> Councilmember Salwan: OKAY.
I THINK HE CHARACTERIZED THAT ACTION AS ILLEGAL.

20:08:54 >> HE DID, AND AS WE DISCUSSED EARLIER WITH COUNCILMEMBER
20:08:57  KASSAN, THERE'S A DISPUTE BETWEEN CITY STAFF
20:09:00  AND THE PARK DISTRICT ON WHETHER THAT WAS ILLEGAL
20:09:04  OR NOT.
WE CERTAINLY FELT IT WAS LEGAL
20:09:07  WHEN THE CITY POLICE CHIEF SENT HER LETTER
20:09:10 .
>> Councilmember Salwan: SO THERE WAS MENTION ALSO OF THE
20:09:14  PARKING LOT EXPANSION THAT THE EAST BAY PARK DISTRICT IS NOT INTEREST
20:09:17 ED IN DOING THAT.
WHY
20:09:21  ISN'T THAT SOMETHING THAT WE CAN HAVE IN THE LEASE STATING THAT THEY WON'T BE EXPANDING
20:09:24  THE PARKING LOT, SINCE THEY DON'T HAVE THE FUNDS, WE DON'T HAVE THE INTEREST
20:09:27 , AND WE HAVE THIS VISION THAT WE WANT TO
20:09:30  PROMOTE THE OHLONE PARKING AREA, WHY CAN'T
20:09:34  WE INSERT LANGUAGE TO THAT EFFECT,
20:09:37  THAT MEMORIALIZES THE UNDERSTANDING WE HAVE RIGHT
20:09:40  NOW.
BECAUSE PROBABLY NONE OF US WILL BE HERE 25
20:09:43  YEARS FROM NOW.

20:09:53 >> Ms. Wolf: I THINK THAT'S A QUESTION THAT WE COULD POSE TO EAST BAY REGIONAL
20:09:56  PARKS AS A FRIENDLY
20:10:00  AMENDMENT, BUT IT WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS ADDRESSED
20:10:03  AT THE BOARD MEETING LAST WEEK AS
20:10:06  THE ITEM WAS ALREADY AMENDED AND PROPOSED TO THE BOARD SO IT WAS
20:10:11  NOT AN AMENDMENT THAT WAS INCLUDED IN OUR AGREEMENT TO THEM LAST WEEK AND THEY
20:10:14  IDENTIFIED IT AT THEIR BOARD MEETING LAST WEEK AS A FORMAL RECOMMENDATION BEFORE THE COMMUNITY.

20:10:18 >> Councilmember Salwan: OKAY.
>> City Mgr. Shackelford:SUZANN E, CORRECT ME IF
20:10:21  I'M WRONG --
>> Ms. Wolf: I CAN LET JIM
20:10:25  O'CONNOR SPEAK TO THAT SPECIFICALLY.

20:10:28 >> City Mgr. Shackelford:SUZANN E, THE LANGUAGE THAT IS IN THERE IS THAT FOR ANY
20:10:32  MAJOR CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT,
20:10:35  THEY WOULD HAVE TO REQUEST THE APPROVAL OF THE CITY
20:10:38  AND THEY'D ALSO HAVE TO GO THROUGH
20:10:42  THE PROPER PERMITTING PROCESS AS WELL, REQUIRE
20:10:45  60-DAY NOTICE, SO FORTH AND SO ON.
SO THERE
20:10:48  IS LANGUAGE IN THE LEASE AGREEMENT THAT
20:10:51  ALLOWS USES TO ADDRESS THAT TYPE OF ISSUE.
IT'S JUST
20:10:55  NOT THAT SPECIFIC LANGUAGE
20:10:59  RELATED TO THE PARKING LOT.

20:11:02 >> Ms. Wolf: THAT'S CORRECT.
AND WE CAN DENY ANYTHING IN THE REQUESTS.

20:11:08 >> Councilmember Salwan: SO SPECIFICALLY A PARKING LOT, WE COULD EXPRESSLY -- IT WOULD COME
20:11:11  TO THE CITY OF FREMONT FOR APPROVAL AND WE COULD DENY
20:11:14  THAT, IS THAT CORRECT?

20:11:17 >> I JUST WANT TO ITERATE THE
20:11:20  SAME THING MS. SHACKELFORD WAS SAYING, I WAS GOING TO SAY
20:11:23  THE SAME THING.
WE HAVE LANGUAGE WITHIN
20:11:27  THE LEASE THAT WOULD
20:11:30  ALLOW FOR PUBLIC INPUT AND THE
20:11:33  CITY'S INPUT ON ANY CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS
20:11:36  AT THE PARK.
>> Councilmember Salwan: AND THEN JUST SOME
20:11:40  CURIOSITY QUESTION AS FAR AS WHEN AN INS TENT HAPPEN
20:11:43 S IN THE PARK, LET'S SAY THERE'S A CRIME
20:11:46  OR SOMEBODY COLLAPSES,
20:11:50  WHO TAKES CARE OF THAT?
IS IT KIND OF A JOINT USE OR
20:11:53  IS IT WHOEVER GETS THERE FIRST?
WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR
20:11:56  THOSE KIND OF INCIDENTS?
>> SO
20:12:00  IN MOST OF THE EMERGENCY SITUATIONS, IT'S GOING TO BE CITY RESPONSE
20:12:03  FIRST, WILL BE THE FIRST IN TO AN INCIDENT LIKE THAT.
IF IT'S A
20:12:06  MAJOR CRIME AND I DO HAVE CAPTAIN BRED
20:12:10 E HERE WHO IS OBVIOUSLY MORE EXPERT THAN I AM, BUT
20:12:13  A MAJOR CRIME, THEN THE INVESTIGATION
20:12:16  OF THE TRIEM WILL BE TOKEN OVER BY THE PARK DISTRICT
20:12:20 .
>> Councilmember Salwan: AND MY LAST QUESTION, AGAIN,
20:12:23  THERE'S THIS UNDERSTANDING THAT WE WANT TO PROMOTE OHLONE
20:12:27  ENTRANCE.
BUT I DON'T SEE ANY SERIOUS COMMITMENT
20:12:30 .
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO?
WE'RE GOING TO ASK
20:12:34  GOOGLE?
THAT'S NOT ENOUGH.
IS THERE SOME TANGIBLE THINGS THAT THE
20:12:37  PARK DISTRICT CAN DO AND MAYBE THE CITY CAN HELP AS
20:12:40  WELL, TO PHYSICALLY MAKE THAT
20:12:44  AREA MORE I
20:12:47  MORE ATTRACTIVE, MORE WELCOMING, MORE OF A
20:12:51  DESTINATION SO THAT IT WILL NATURALLY
20:12:54  -- RIGHT NOW IT'S NOT THE PRETTIER PART OF THE ENTRANCE.

20:12:57 SO IF
20:13:00  IF YOU HAVE A CHOICE, YOU'RE GOING TO WANT TO USE
20:13:04  THE STANFORD, SO WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO TO
20:13:07  MAKE IT MORE ATTRACTIVE FOR THE VISITORS
20:13:11 ?
>> COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN, WE HAVE SEVERAL
20:13:14  CHALLENGES HERE.
ONE IS THE COLLEGE HAS ITS OWN CAPITAL PROGRAM
20:13:17  WHICH INCLUDES SOME OF THE AREA WHERE THE ENTRANCE IS
20:13:20 .
SO THAT'S ONE THING.
AND ONE THING I WANT TO
20:13:23  ASSURE YOU AND THE OART COUNCILMEMBERS IS THAT MYSELF AND
20:13:26  SUZANNE AND OTHER CITY AND DISTRICT STAFF HAVE
20:13:30  ENGAGED WITH THE COLLEGE.
THAT ENGAGEMENT WAS
20:13:33  ONGOING UNTIL THE PANDEMIC AND WE HOPEFULLY WILL TAKE THAT UP
20:13:37  AGAIN, AND THEY HAVE A NEW PRESIDENT, DR. BISHOP, WHICH I
20:13:40  HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO INTRODUCE MYSELF TO, BUT WE DO HAVE
20:13:43  A LIAISON ROLE WITH THE COLLEGE.
SO WOVE
20:13:46  WE'VE GOT
20:13:49  SOME CHALLENGES WITH THEIR OWN CAPITAL PROGRAM AND THEIR
20:13:53  OWN INTENTIONS FOR THATTER A THERE.
WE ARE MORE THAN WILLING TO CONTINUE TO CONVERSATION WITH THEM
20:13:56 .
BACK IN 2016, WE DID ADD A WATER FOUNTAIN
20:13:59  WHICH WAS SEVERELY
20:14:03  LACKING AT THAT ENTRANCE TO PARK SO WEAR OPEN TO ENGAGING
20:14:06  WITH THE COLLEGE AND I DO FORM THAT LIAISON ROLE WITH
20:14:09  THE COLLEGE SO I
20:14:12  -- CONTINUE THAT CONVERSATION.
>> Councilmember Salwan: THAT'S ALL THE QUESTIONS FOR NOW
20:14:16 .
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
CLARIFYING QUESTIONS, COUNCILMEMBER
20:14:17  KENG.
>> Councilmember Keng: THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR.

20:14:21 SO I DO HAVE SEVERAL QUESTIONS.
FIRST QUESTION
20:14:24  IS, HOW MANY OF THE NEARBY PARKS IN
20:14:27  THE EAST BAY REGIONAL
20:14:30  PARK DISTRICT THAT HAS THE OPENING HOURS
20:14:33  OF 6:00 A.M. TOLL
20:14:37  NINE OR 10:00 P.M.?

20:14:41 >> SO COUNCILMEMBER KENG, THE HOURS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
20:14:44  HERE ARE REALLY WHAT WE CALL THE CURFEW HOURS.

20:14:47 THESE ARE THE TIMES OF THE DAY
20:14:50  THAT THE PARK IS CLOSED TO ACCESS.
IN MOST
20:14:53  OF OUR PARKS, THE VAST MAJORITY, THE CURFEW HOURS ARE
20:14:56  10:00 P.M. TO 5:00 A.M.
WE SPECIFICALLY MODIFIED
20:15:00  THOSE CURFEW HOURS AT THE STANFORD ENTRANCE
20:15:03  TO ADDRESS THE NEIGHBORHOOD CONCERNS.
SO
20:15:06  -- AND THEN
20:15:11  LET'S DISTINGUISH PARKING HOURS, THOSE VARY
20:15:15  ACROSS THE PA PARK DISTRICT
20:15:19 , DPENT DEPENDING ON STAFF, HE WHEN WE CAN
20:15:22  GET TO A PARK AND WE HAVE
20:15:25  CURFEW HOURS WHICH ARE USUALLY
20:15:29  10:00 A.M. TO 5:00 A.M., THEN WE HAVE
20:15:32  --
20:15:35  WHEN GATES ARE OPEN FOR PARKING.
SO IT'S DIFFERENT
20:15:39  ALL THROUGHOUT
20:15:42  T  THROUGHOUT.
>> Councilmember Keng: THANK  YOU.
A
20:15:45  LOT OF OUR
20:15:48  PARKS HAVE
20:15:52  OURS TO SUNSET, SO I'M
20:15:55  UNDERSTANDING PEOPLE CAN STILL GO IN AT
20:15:59  NINE OR 10 AND THEN THEY ARE HANGING OUT
20:16:03  THERE UNTIL MIDNIGHT OR AFTER AN THEN YOU'RE
20:16:06  LOOKING AT PEOPLE BEING UP THERE
20:16:09  ALMOST  24/7, AND SO I
20:16:12  THINK BECAUSE OF THE -- IN RECENT YEARS, THE VISITS
20:16:15  TO MISSION PEAK HAS INCREASED TREMENDOUS
20:16:19 LY TO THE UPWARDS OF A
20:16:22  QUARTER MILLION PEOPLE A YEAR.
I THINK KEEPING THE
20:16:25  HOURS ALONE ESPECIALLY IN
20:16:29  A RESIDENTIAL AREA REALLY EXPRESSED
20:16:33  THE EAST BAY REGIONAL
20:16:37  PARK DISTRICT HAS OTHER PARK
20:16:40 S THAT HAVE LOCKING ELECTRONIC
20:16:44  GATES THAT WE MIGHT CONSIDER OVER HERE
20:16:47  AT THE MISSION PEAK.

20:16:52 >> WE DO HAVE ONE OR TWO PARKS THAT HAVE THOSE GATES.
THE
20:16:55  ONE THING I WOULD SAY, AND I THINK THE CITY'S EXPERIENCE IS
20:16:58  SEMI LAR,
20:17:01  THEY'RE VERY PRONE TO MAINTENANCE PROBLEM
20:17:05 MED, THEY'RE NOT WHAT WE CONSIDER STATE OF THE ART OR CURRENT
20:17:08  PRACTICE.
SO THAT'S WHAT I WAS
20:17:14  WOULD SAY ON THAT MATTER.
>> Councilmember Keng: OKAY, THANK YOU.

20:17:18 HOWL ABOUT DO YOU HAVE OTHER PARK ENTRANCES
20:17:24  RESTRICTED TO BIKE AND PEDESTRIANS ONLY BARKS US IN THE
20:17:28  CITY OF FREMONT, WE HAVE BEEN BUILDING A LOT OF
20:17:31  BIKE LANES OVER AND THEN THERE IS ALSO A
20:17:34  BUS STOP AT STANFORD AND MISSION BOULEVARD,
20:17:37  AND SO WE
20:17:43  -- PERHAPS IF WE RESTRICT ONE SIDE TO BIKE AND
20:17:47  PEDESTRIANS AND THE OART SIDE TO CARS PARKING THAT WOULD ALSO
20:17:50  MITIGATE THOSE  ISSUES.
>> WE
20:17:53  DON'T HAVE ACCESSES THAT ARE RESTRICTED SPECIFICALLY TO
20:17:56  BICYCLE OR PEDESTRIAN ACCESS.
WE DO HAVE NEIGHBORHOOD
20:18:00  ACCESS POINTS WHERE THERE'S NO PARKING LOT SPECIFICALLY
20:18:03  PROVIDED FOR THE PARK.
BUT NOTHING THAT'S RESTRICTED TO
20:18:07  ONLY PEDESTRIAN OR
20:18:10  BIKE ACCESS.
SO I GUESS THE ANSWER TO YOUR
20:18:13  QUESTION IS WE DO HAVE NEIGHBORHOOD -- I DON'T HAVE PARKING
20:18:16  LOTS ASSOCIATED WITH THEM.
>> Councilmember Keng: RIGHT, RIGHT.
SO WHAT ABOUT --
20:18:20  IS IT THE VARGAS REGIONAL PARK,
20:18:23  IS IT PARTIALLY WITH BIKE
20:18:27  AND PEDESTRIANS ONLY?
>> SO THAT'S A SITUATION WHERE WE HAVE
20:18:30  BOTH.
SO WE HAVE A PARKING
20:18:33  LOT AT THE TOP, AND AT THE BOTTOM
20:18:36  OF MORRISON CANYON AS YOU'RE WELL AWARE
20:18:40 , THAT ROAD WAS CLOSED BY THE CITY AND AT THE BOTTOM
20:18:43  IS A PUBLIC ACCESS POINT THERE OFF OF
20:18:47  MORRISON CANYON ROAD, SO THAT'S A INTO THE ACCESS
20:18:50  AND THERE'S LIKE ONE PARKING SPACE ACROSS FROM THAT BUT NOT
20:18:53  OAR WISE.
>> OKAY, THANK YOU.
AND HOW ABOUT THE
20:18:56  LENGTH OF THE LEASE, THE
20:18:59  25 YEARS JUST SEEMS REALLY LONG TO ME.

20:19:03 SO EVERYONE ALSO HAVING THESE 25-
20:19:06 YEAR LEASES BECAUSE IT JUST
20:19:10  JUST -- LIKE ANY VARIATIONS OR THINGS
20:19:13  THAT WE NEED TO ADJUST
20:19:16  IS JUST ALMOST NOT POSSIBLE.
>> WELL, IN
20:19:20  OUR EXPERIENCE WITH PUBLIC
20:19:23  AGENCY LEASES, WE OFTEN TO THE LONG TERM
20:19:26  LEASES BECAUSE WE DIDN'T EX-PECKED A
20:19:29  GREAT DEAL OF CHANGE, BUT OBVIOUSLY EITHER AGENCY
20:19:33  CAN BRING ABOUT A
20:19:36  -- THERE'S ALWAYS THE TERMINATION
20:19:41  TERMINATION -- ALL OF THESE AGREEMENTS.
>> Councilmember Keng: I
20:19:44  THINK IN A LOT OF COMMERCIAL LEASES, YOU WOULD PUT A
20:19:48  FIVE OR 10-YEAR AND THEN YOU COULD HAVE AN
20:19:52  EXTENSION IF THERE'S NOTHING TO CHANGE, YOU
20:19:55  CAN EXTEND THE  LEASE, BUT IT
20:19:58  JUST SEEMS LIKE 25 YEARS IS TOO LONG.
SO THANK YOU
20:20:01 .
THAT'S MY QUESTIONS FOR NOW.

20:20:06 >> Mayor Mei: COUNCILMEMBER JONES, CLARIFYING QUESTIONS, PLEASE.

20:20:13 >> Councilmember Jones: THANK YOU, MADAM JONES.
THERE SEEMS
20:20:16  TO BE A
20:20:19  PERCEIVED CLOSURE OF THE PARK THAT WAS
20:20:23  DUG BY CHIEF PETERSEN LAST YEAR.
JUST
20:20:26  TO CLARIFY AND EITHER CHIEF WASHINGTON OR MISLAY SEE
20:20:29  CAN ANSWER THIS, WE DID NOT PHYSICALLY CLOSE
20:20:33  THE GATES OF THE PARK.
WE SIMPLY
20:20:36  RESTRICTED ACCESS TO THE PARK BY CLOSING THE
20:20:39  SURROUNDING STREETS, AND REGARDLESS OF WHAT
20:20:42  LANGUAGE IS IN THE LEASE WITH THE
20:20:45  PARK SAYING THEY HAD SOLE CONTROL OVER THE PARK
20:20:49 , THEY DO, WE, ON THE OTHER HAND, STILL HAVE SOLE CONTROL
20:20:52  OVER STREET ACCESS:
20:20:57 
>> THAT IS CORRECT.
>> OKAY.

20:21:00 SO WHILE IT SEEMS TO BE A CON
20:21:03  CONTRADICTION, THAT DOES SPECIFY
20:21:06  THAT WE STILL HAD THE AUTHORITY TO CLOSE
20:21:10  THE STREET IS  NECESSARY.
WE'RE NOT GOING
20:21:13  TO TOUCH THE GATES OR ANYTHING ELSE, BUT WE DO HAVE THAT AUTHORITY.

20:21:16 THE OTHER QUESTION I WOULD HAVE FOR EITHER CHIEF WASHINGTON
20:21:20  OR CAPTAIN BREDE, HOW MANY CURFEW
20:21:23  VIOLATIONS, IF YOU KNOW, HAVE BEEN REPORTED OVER THE
20:21:26  LAST YEAR OR SO, WHAT HAVE YOU.

20:21:29 I'M ASSUMING THAT NUMBER HAS GONE UP DURING THE PANDEMIC.

20:21:33 >> THANK YOU, COUNCILMEMBER JONES.
WE'VE ISSUE
20:21:37 ED 216 CITATIONS SINCE JANUARY OF
20:21:42  2020, 62 OF WHICH WERE CURFEW-RELATED.

20:21:45 SO THE AMOUNT OF CURFEW-RELATED CITATIONS ARE
20:21:48  NOT A VERY HIGH NUMBER.
THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT WE DON'T
20:21:51  ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE HAVE PEOPLE GOING IN AFTER HOURS, SO
20:21:55  WE CONTINUE TO WORK REAL CLOSELY WITH OUR PARTNERS
20:21:58 , ABOUT
20:22:02  AND BY CONTINUING TO SCT PUBLIC TO HELP
20:22:05  US TO REACH OUT TO US
20:22:09  ANY TIME THEY SEE VIOLATIONS IN THE PARK SO
20:22:12  WE CAN --
20:22:17  SEMI LAR TO
20:22:20  LAR TO OTHER PARKS YOU OPERATE IN THE CITY?
>> 
20:22:23 I WOULD SAY THEY'RE A LITTLE HIGHER THAN SOME OTHER PARKS IN THE CITY JUST BECAUSE OF THE
20:22:26  POPULARITY OF MISSION PEAK.
MISSION PEAK AS YOU KNOW IS VERY POPULAR, ESPECIALLY
20:22:30  WITH SOCIAL MEDIA OVER THE LAST SEVEN, EIGHT YEARS.

20:22:33 A LOT OF THE OTHER PARKS, COYOTE HILLS HAS SEEN A
20:22:36  LARGE INCREASE IN USAGE, ESPECIALLY DURING THE PANDEMIC, JUST
20:22:39  LIKE THE REST OF THE PARKS THROUGHOUT THE DISTRICT.
BUT NOT TO
20:22:42  THE SAME LEVEL
20:22:46  WITH THE AFTER-HOUR ISSUES AS WE SEE AT MISSION PEAK.

20:22:52 >> Councilmember Jones: OKAY.
IT SEEMED LIKE WITH CHIEF WASHINGTON, THERE WERE
20:22:56  REALLY NOT A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF VIOLATIONS
20:23:03 .
CHIEF WASHINGTON, IF YOU'RE STILL HERE, JUST TO CLARIFY
20:23:07  WITH THE PARKING PERMIT PROCESS WE NOW HAVE TWO PARKING
20:23:10  ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS TO CARRY OUT THOSE  DUTIES, IS THAT CORRECT
20:23:14 ?
>> YES, COUNCILMEMBER, THAT IS CORRECT.

20:23:17 WE WERE ABLE TO FULFILL -- WE HAVE
20:23:20  ONE COMMUNITY SERVICE OFFICER THAT'S IN CHARGE OF THE
20:23:23  PROGRAM AND TWO FULL-TIME PARKING COMPLIANCE OFFICER
20:23:26 S THAT NOW RESPOND TO THAT PARTICULAR AREA
20:23:30 , THE MISSION PEACE STANFORD AREA
20:23:33  TO ENFORCE PARKING VIOLATIONS AND
20:23:36  PERMIT PARKING VIOLATIONS.
>> SO
20:23:39  THE AVERAGE CALLS FOR SERVICE OTHER THAN THE SELF-
20:23:42  SELF-INITIATED ACTIVITY AVERAGES OUT TO ABOUT 10 PER
20:23:45  MONTH, IS THAT RIGHT?
>> YEAH
20:23:48 , I THINK THAT'S ABOUT RIGHT.
I WOULD HAVE TO DOUBLE-CHECK
20:23:52  ALL MY STATS BUT I THINK THAT IS ABOUT RIGHT.

20:23:55 >> Councilmember Jones: OKAY.
AND THEN I'LL JUST GO ACROSS THE BOARD HERE.

20:23:58 I'M NOT SURE IF CHIEF JACOBSON IS HERE YET, BUT
20:24:02  IF NOT, DEPUTY
20:24:06 , DID YOU MEASURE THE NUMBER
20:24:09  OF VEGETATION FIRES THAT FREMONT HAS RESPONDED
20:24:13  TO IN RECENT  TIMES?
IF I MISSED
20:24:16  THAT, I --
>> 
20:24:20 I BELIEVE
20:24:23  --
20:24:25  I BELIEVE ONE.
>> Councilmember Jones: JUST ONE.
OKAY.

20:24:28 HAS YOUR ACCESS OR YOUR RESPONSE TIME, AND I UNDERSTAND THE
20:24:32  TERRAIN IS EXTREMELY  CHALLENGING, BUT HAVE YOU
20:24:35  SEEN AN UPTICK IN RESPONSES
20:24:38  FOR MEDICAL AID OR VEGETATION FIRES OR
20:24:41  ANYTHING IN THE LAST, SAY, FIVE YEARS?

20:24:48 >> NO, NO MAJOR UPTICK.
IT'S PRETTY CONSISTENT.

20:24:52 WE SPOKE TO ALL THE BATTALION CHIEFS AND THEN RAN A FULL
20:24:55  QUERY OF ALL OF THE CALLS FOR SERVICE THERE, AND LIKE CHIEF T
20:24:59  DIAS SAID, PRIMARILY
20:25:03  WARM -- ON WEEKENDS,
20:25:06  THE MAJORITY OF THE CALLS WERE E
20:25:09  EMS-RELATED
20:25:12  IS JUST SO WE HAVE MORE HANDS FOR OUR PERSONNEL
20:25:16  IN ORDER TO GET PEOPLE DOWN FROM THE SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN GENERALLY BECAUSE
20:25:19  IT'S MOSTLY FALSE SLIPS, TWISTED ANKLES,
20:25:22  THOSE KIND OF THINGS, AND WE OFTEN HAVE TO USE
20:25:25  A STOKES BASKET OR OUR ATV TO GET PEOPLE
20:25:29  DOWN FROM ACCESS AREAS WHERE THEY COULDN'T OTHERWISE WALK
20:25:32  DOWN.

20:25:39 >> SO IT WAS THE SAME PERCENTAGE OF CALLS
20:25:42  FOR MEDALLION CAL ASSISTANTS 40 YEARS AGO, WHEN THE AREA
20:25:45  WAS VERY POPULAR FOR
20:25:53  ACCESS AND ACCESSIBILITY.
SO -- AND THEN THE OTHER
20:25:56  QUESTION THAT WAS BROUGHT UP WAS THE RED FLAG WARNING
20:25:59 .
IS THERE ANY AGENCY, WHETHER IT BE CITY,
20:26:02  COUNTY, WHOEVER, LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT, THAT HAS
20:26:05  AUTHORITY TO CLOSE A PARK DURING A RED FLAG WARNING?

20:26:10 >> THAT WOULD BE UP TO THE EAST BAY REGIONAL PARKS CHIEF.

20:26:13 I DO BELIEVE SHE HAS THAT AUTHORITY.

20:26:19 >> Councilmember Jones: OKAY, IS THAT CORRECT, JIM?
>> COUNCILMEMBER JONES, THAT'S 
20:26:23 CORRECT.
WE HAVE CLOSED PARKS DUAL TO FIRE
20:26:26  DANGER.
YOU MIGHT RECALL LAST YEAR
20:26:29  WHEN WE HAD THE
20:26:32  THREE -- WE DID CLOSE SOME OF OUR PRKS BECAUSE OF
20:26:36  THAT
20:26:40  AGAIN JUST TO CLARIFY, THE PARKING
20:26:43  SPACES THAT YOU CURRENTLY HAVE, THERE ARE NO RESTRICTIONS
20:26:46  IN OUR OUT OF THAT PARTICULAR PARKING LOT, I BELIEVE IT'S
20:26:49  43 SPACES.
IS THAT RIGHT?
>> THAT'S CORRECT.

20:26:53 >> Councilmember Jones: SO IS THERE -- AND HAVING BEEN --
20:26:56   STAYED OVERNIGHT
20:26:59  AT CORA LAKES RECENTLY, WOULD THERE BE ANY
20:27:02  BENEFIT TO PUTTING
20:27:09  -- TO LIMIT THAT ACCESS MUCH LIKE YOU DO, ALTHOUGH
20:27:13  THAT WOULD -- ENTIRE
20:27:18  YOU HAVE THE CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT FUNDS FOR THAT
20:27:21 , CORRECT?
>> 
20:27:24  -- TO MAKE THAT EFFECTIVE.
>> Councilmember Jones: OKAY.
THANK YOU.

20:27:27 THOSE ARE ALL THE QUESTIONS FOR NOW.
>> Mayor Mei: I JUST
20:27:30  WANTED TO NOTE, WE HAVE TWO MORE COUNCILMEMBER WITH CLARIFYING QUESTIONS
20:27:34  BUT WE WILL NEED A BREAK FOR OUR STENOCAPTIONERS BEFORE WE CONTINUE
20:27:37  WITH THE PUBLIC COMMENT BECAUSE WE'RE OVERDUE FOR A BREAK.

20:27:40 COUNCILMEMBER COX, CLARIFYING QUESTIONS.

20:27:50 MY APOLOGIES, YOU ARE ON MUTE.
THANK YOU.

20:27:53 >> Councilmember Cox: THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION.
I DID
20:27:56  HAVE SOME CLARIFYING QUESTIONS
20:28:00 .
ONE IS, YOU TALK ABOUT IN SECTION
20:28:04  5 SUBSECTION C ABOUT ROUTINE MAINTENANCE, AND I WANTED TO KIND
20:28:07  OF UNDERSTAND
20:28:12  WHAT IS ROUTINE VERSUS IF YOU HAVE TO REPLACE A FENCE
20:28:15  FOR ENTRY INTO
20:28:19  THE PARK, IS
20:28:22  THAT REPLACEMENT THAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED A CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT
20:28:25  PROJECT VERSUS IF YOU'RE  REPAIRING A
20:28:29  FENCE THAT'S JUST ROUTINE BUT IT'S NOT DEFINE
20:28:32 ED ANYWHERE IN THE CONTRACT EXCEPT
20:28:35  FOR -- BUT WANTED TO UNDERSTAND THAT PIECE.

20:28:39 >> SURE, I'LL DO MY BEST TO DEFINE THAT.
SOMETHING LIKE
20:28:42  REPLACING A SECTION OF
20:28:46  FENCE OR A FENCE THAT'S COME DOWN FOR VARIOUS REASONS, I MEAN, WE HAVE
20:28:49  A LOT OF OLD, YOU KNOW, BARBED
20:28:52  WIRE FENCING THAT OFTEN IF YOU HAVE A FIRE, A
20:28:55  WIND EVENT, A TREE FALL DOWN, THOSE THINGS HAVE TO BE
20:28:59  REPLACED, ALL THOSE -- WOULD I
20:29:02  WHAT CONSIDER MAJOR REPLACEMENTS OF MAJOR FACILITIES
20:29:05 , IF WE WERE TO FIX THE EXIST
20:29:08 ING FAULT RESTROOM THAT WOULD BE
20:29:12  A CAPITAL EXPENSE,
20:29:15  CAPITAL REPLACEMENT.
BUT MOST OF THE WORK, THIS IS AN
20:29:18  OPEN SPACE PARK.
IT VERY LIMITED DEVELOPMENT.
WE'VE GOT TRAILS, WE'VE GOT
20:29:22  SOME FENCING, AND IT'S REALLY  LIMITED.
WE'VE
20:29:24  GOT BENCHES, WE'VE GOT THE WATER FOUNTAIN.
IT A VERY LIMITED PARK.

20:29:28 IT'S VERY OPEN SPACE ORIENTED.
THIS IS NOT A CAMP
20:29:31 ING, PICNICKING TYPE OF PARK.
SO
20:29:36  CAPITAL EXPENSES ARE PRETTY LIMITED.
OBVIOUSLY
20:29:39  WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE PROPOSED PARKING
20:29:43  PROJECT WHICH IS NOW
20:29:47  NOT HAPPENING SO IT'S PRETTY LIMITED IN TERMS
20:29:50  OF CAPITAL.
MOST OF THE WORK WE DO IS CONSIDERED
20:29:54  ROUTINE MAINTENANCE.
>> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.
I ASSUME AS PART
20:29:58  OF THE PARK OPERATIONS, YOU WOULD BE MANAGING THE WILDLIFE THERE THAT YOU
20:30:01  WOULD TAKE CARE OF ANY OF THE ANIMALS
20:30:05  THAT
20:30:08  MAY APPEAR UP IN THE AREA THERE, SO YOU WERE MANAGING
20:30:11  THAT PART, IS THAT WHAT I'M UNDERSTANDING?
>> WELL, WE OBVIOUSLY
20:30:15  MANAGE THE HABITAT IN TERMS OF THE
20:30:18  HABITAT THAT THOSE ANIMALS LIVE IN,
20:30:21  BUT WILDLIFE IS REGULATED BY THE STATE, BY THE CALIFORNIA
20:30:24  DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE, AND WE DO WORK CLOSELY WITH THEM ON LOTS
20:30:27  OF PROJECTS TO ENHANCE WILDLIFE
20:30:31  AND WE ALSO WORK WITH THEM WHEN THERE'S PROBABLY WITH
20:30:34  WILDLIFE, LIKE ANY INCIDENTS BETWEEN HUMANS AND WILDLIFE,
20:30:37  SO WE WORK CLOSELY WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE
20:30:41 .
>> Councilmember Cox: I GUESS I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND A LITTLE BIT.

20:30:45 SO WOULD YOU TAKE CARE IF A SKUNK OR A FOX
20:30:48  SHOW UP VERSUS
20:30:53  SOME SORT OF DEER THAT'S PROTECTED BY THE WILDLIFE
20:30:57 ?
I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHERE IS IT THAT IT'S THE CITY
20:31:00  OF FREMONT'S RESPONSIBILITY VERSUS
20:31:04  WHAT WOULD BE THE PARK DISTRICT RESPONSIBILITY ON THAT PART?

20:31:08 >> WELL, I THINK YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WILDLIFE ENTERING
20:31:11  THE NEIGHBORHOODS.
IS THAT THE QUESTION YOU'RE  ASKING?

20:31:14 >> Councilmember Cox: ENTERING THE NEIGHBORHOODS OR, YOU KNOW, APPEAR
20:31:18 ING WHERE WE MAY HAVE  HIKERS
20:31:22  UP IN THE --
>> COUNCILMEMBER COX, REMEMBER THE
20:31:25  REGIONAL PARK IS A WILD
20:31:28   LAND.
THIS IS HABITAT.
WE HAVE WILDLIFE, EVERYTHING
20:31:31  FROM, YOU KNOW, RACCOONS AND SKUNKS AND
20:31:34  DEER, WE HAVE MOUNTAIN LION, WE HAVE BOBCATS THERE
20:31:37 , FOX.
IT'S QUITE A WILD AREA
20:31:41 .
IT ATTACHES OF COURSE TO THE SUNOL
20:31:44  REGIONAL PARK AND OHLONE
20:31:47  WILDERNESS.
SO THIS IS HABITAT AREA AND GENERALLY WE
20:31:51  MAINTAIN THE HABITAT BUT THIS IS A WILD LAND AND
20:31:54  THOSE ARE THE NATURAL INHABITANTS OF THIS AREA.

20:31:59 >> Councilmember Cox: BUT WHO HAS THE CONTRACT, I MEAN, ARE YOU SAYING
20:32:02  THAT IN THIS
20:32:06  PART, IF SOMETHING HAPPENS, THAT SOMEONE
20:32:09  GETS INJURED, I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND, IF
20:32:12  A BOBCAT YOU MENTIONED ATTACK
20:32:15 ED SOMEONE, THEN WHO WOULD BE SUED?
WOULD IT BE THE CITY OF
20:32:18  FREMONT OR WOULD IT BE THE PARK DISTRICT
20:32:21  DISTRICT?
>> I CAN'T SPEAK TO WHO
20:32:24  WOULD BE SUED BUT I CAN TALK TO THE FACT OF HOW WE
20:32:28  APPROACH THOSE TYPES OF INCIDENTS.
SO OUR PARK
20:32:31  STAFF OR PUBLIC SAFETY STAFF WOULD WORK WITH OUR WILDLIFE BIOLOGIST
20:32:34 S, WE WOULD WORK CLOSELY WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND
20:32:37  WILDLIFE, AND WE WOULD EVALUATE THE INCIDENT
20:32:41 .
AND DETERMINE WHAT WERE THE CAUSATION
20:32:44  FACTORS.
THEN FISH AND WILDLIFE
20:32:47  WOULD MOST LIKELY TAKE THE LEAD IF THAT ANIMAL WAS GOING TO BE EUTHANIZ
20:32:51 ED, CAPTURED AND EUTHANIZED FOR PUBLIC
20:32:54  SAFETY.
SO THAT'S SOMETHING WE DO WITH RARELY
20:32:57 , IT'S A RARE TYPE OF INCIDENT BUT WE DO
20:33:01  WORK WITH FISH AND WILDLIFE QUITE CLOSE CLEE ON THOSE TYPES OF
20:33:04   INCIDENTS.
>> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.

20:33:08 BUT YOU WOULD STILL BE RESPONSIBLE, THE PARK WOULD STILL BE
20:33:11  RESPONSIBLE FOR TAKING THE ACTION
20:33:15  FOR FOLLOW-UP AND THINGS LIKE THAT?
I'M JUST TRYING
20:33:18  TO DEFINE --
>> IN THE
20:33:21  PARK AREA, IF WE HAVE AN INTERACTION BETWEEN WILDLIFE AND
20:33:24  HUMANS, WE WOULD TAKE CHARGE OF THAT INCIDENT, TAKE RESPONSIBILITY
20:33:27  FOR IT.
THAT'S ABSOLUTELY CORRECT.

20:33:30 >> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.
THAT'S WHAT I WAS TRYING TO GET AT.
THANK YOU.

20:33:33 >> YOU'RE WELCOME.
>> I HAD ANOTHER QUESTION
20:33:37  AND TERMS OF
20:33:43  AGREEING WITH MY OTHER CITY COUNCILMEMBERS ON THE  25-YEAR
20:33:46  LEASE, AND WAS THERE ANY
20:33:49  PART OF LOOKING AT IT AS A PHASE-IN
20:33:52  OF ROUGHLY FIVE YEARS WITH AN OPTION TO RENEW FOR
20:33:55  ADDITIONAL FIVE YEARS BUT
20:33:59  ALSO TAKING A LOOK AND GETTING FEEDBACK FROM CITY
20:34:02  STAFF, ALSO FROM THE COMMUNITY ON HOW THINGS ARE OPERATING
20:34:05  UNDER THE AGREEMENT.
I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING COVERED ABOUT COMMUNITY MEETINGS
20:34:15 , IT WAS LIKE INDIVIDUAL ACTIONS THAT YOU WOULD DO A
20:34:18  REVIEW AND THERE WOULD BE A PROPER APPROVAL BUT IN THE FORM OF
20:34:22  A HE'S AGREEMENT
20:34:25  UNDERSTANDING HOW THERE COULD BE INPUT
20:34:28  FROM THE PUBLIC AND ESPECIALLY AROUND WITH THE RESIDENTS THAT LIVE
20:34:31  NEAR THE PARK, HOW ARE WE GOING TO HAVE INPUT
20:34:34  INTO THAT AND WHERE IS THERE A PERFORMANCE
20:34:38  REVIEW OF HOW THE PARK HAS BEEN
20:34:41  PERFORMING BECAUSE
20:34:44  FOR 25 YEARS TO NOT HAVE THAT TYPE OF INPUT OR WORKING, I
20:34:47  I KNOW EVERYBODY IS
20:34:50  SAYING THEY WORK TOGETHER WHICH I APPRECIATE THE CAMARADERIE
20:34:53  AND COLLABORATION BUT I'D LIKE TO HAVE SOMETHING ADDRESSING THAT THERE IS SOME SORT
20:34:57  OF REVIEW OF HOW THE PARK
20:35:04  IS GOING, HOW THE CITY OF FREMONT, HOW IT MEETS THE
20:35:07  COMMUNITY THERE, ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT ARE RESIDENTS
20:35:15  -- BECAUSE I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING LIKE THAT OUTLINED IN ANY OF THE CONTRACT
20:35:19  CLAUSES TO ALLOW THAT TYPE OF OPPORTUNITY.

20:35:26 >> ONE OF THE THINGS WE DO IS HAVE A REGULARLY SCHEDULED LIAISON
20:35:29  MEETING BETWEEN THE EAST BAY REGIONAL
20:35:32  PARKS AND CITY OF FREMONT WHERE WE HAVE TWO BOARD MEMBERS
20:35:36 , CURRENTLY COUNCILMEMBER JONES AND THE RECREATION
20:35:39  COMMISSION AND WE GET TOGETHER AND
20:35:42  REVIEW DIFFERENT ISSUES THROUGHOUT THAT TIME.
IF IT IS AN ACTION THAT
20:35:46  THE LIAISON COMMISSION
20:35:49  SHOULD REVIEW THIS ON A REGULAR BASIS EVERY FIVE YEARS AND THAT WOULD BE A
20:35:52  PLACE WHERE WOULD TAKE THAT ACTION.
I THINK THE POINT IS WE
20:35:55  WORK VERY CLOSELY ON ALL OUR PARK ISSUES, WE OFTEN
20:35:59  DISCUSS ISSUES THROUGHOUT THE PARK SYSTEM THERE AND WE
20:36:02  TAKE VARIOUS DISCUSSION POINTS THROUGHOUT
20:36:05  EVERY MEETING WE DISCUSS VARIOUS TOPICS  RELATED TO THE
20:36:09  SEVEN PARKS AND THAT WOULD BE THE PLACE THAT WE HAVE THOSE DISCUSSION ITEMS OF
20:36:12  REVIEW.

20:36:16 >> Councilmember Cox: AND THAT'S WHAT
20:36:19  WITH THE COMMUNITY RELAY SON I UNDERSTAND,
20:36:22  BUT IF IT'S NOT IN THE CONTRACT, IT'S NOT GOING TO BE FOLLOWED.
IT'S GOT TO
20:36:25  HAVE SOMETHING THAT THERE'S A CLOSED LOOP THERE THAT THERE IS SOME
20:36:29  PERFORMANCE  REVIEWS AND
20:36:32  SOME DISCUSSIONS THAT WE DON'T MISS SIGHT OF THE COMMUNICATIONS.
I KNOW THAT
20:36:35  THIS IS DONE WITH THE CITY OF FREMONT, BUT UNDER THIS AGREEMENT
20:36:39 , I JUST THINK THAT THERE SHOULD BE AN AREA
20:36:43  OF SHARING INFORMATION AND
20:36:46  SAYING HOW THINGS THAT BOTH PARTIES CAN WORK TOGETHER
20:36:49  TO IMPROVE, BUT ALSO ALLOWING THE PUBLIC TO BE ABLE
20:36:52  TO HAVE AN
20:36:55  OPPORTUNITY TO VOICE WHETHER IT'S AT THE COMMUNITY LIAISON
20:36:59  BUT ROLLING IT INTO IF THERE'S THINGS THAT WE NEED TO
20:37:02  TAKE A LOOK AT AND OPERATING
20:37:05  UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.

20:37:16 AND I HAD ANOTHER QUESTION BUT
20:37:19  WE COULD PUT THAT AS A  PLACEHOLDER.

20:37:22 I WANTED TO FIND OUT ON TERMS OF THE STANDARD
20:37:25  -- FOR THE PARK HOURS, IT SEEMS LIKE WITH THE
20:37:29  PARK AND JUST TAKING A LOOK AT LIKE
20:37:33  MISSION PEAK HAD ONE SET OF HOURS, OHLONE
20:37:36  COLLEGE HAD THREE ADDITIONAL HOURS ADDED ON
20:37:40 , AND THE QUARRY
20:37:43  LAKES HAD A DIFFERENT SET OF HOURS.
WON'T
20:37:46  IT MAKE SENSE TO HAVE STANDARD HOURS THROUGHOUT
20:37:49  THE PARKS HERE IN FREMONT FOR MANAGING ALL OF OUR PARKS AND THEN
20:37:52  THAT WOULD BE KIND OF STANDARD FOR COMMUNICATING TO ALL OF
20:37:56  OUR RESIDENTS THAT LIVE HERE AND ALSO AS
20:37:59  WE KNOW WE HAVE A LOT OF VISITORS AS WELL TO ENJOY THE BEAUTY
20:38:03  OF OUR PARKS, AND I JUST
20:38:06  THOUGHT FROM AN OPERATIONAL STANDPOINT, IT WOULD KIND OF MAKE
20:38:09  SENSE TO BE ABLE TO ALLOW
20:38:13  SOME SORT OF STANDARDIZATION THERE IN HOURS.

20:38:16 I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS ARE ON THAT, BUT JUST WANTED TO RAISE THE QUESTION
20:38:20  ON THAT.
>> IT'S A GOOD QUESTION, COUNCILMEMBER
20:38:23  COX.
BULL WHAT WE TRY TO DO AT THE
20:38:26  PARK DISTRICT IS ALL OF OUR  PARKS ARE UNIQUE IN TERMS
20:38:30  OF THEIR RESOURCES AND TYPES OF RECREATIONAL ACTIVITY THAT OCCUR
20:38:33  OCCUR, SO I THINK WHAT WE TRY TO DO IS BE
20:38:37  RESPONSIVE TO THAT.
SO FOR INSTANCE,
20:38:40  QUARRY LAKES HAS QUITE A BIT OF FISHING ACTIVITY THAT GOES
20:38:43  ON AND THAT OCCURS EARLY IN THE MORNING.
YOU KNOW, WHEN
20:38:46  WE HAD INITIALLY MODIFIED THE HOURS AT THE
20:38:49  STANFORD ENTRANCE, THE INTENT WAS TO ALLOW PEOPLE IN THE
20:38:53  COMMUNITY WHO -- TO GET UP AND GO HIKING AFTER
20:38:56  WORK, SO WE EXTENDED THOSE HOURS.
SO I
20:38:59  THINK OUR RESPONSE TO THE QUESTION IS, WE DO
20:39:04  MODIFY HOURS OR HAVE HOURS THAT ARE APPROPRIATE FOR THE TYPE OF PARK AND THE
20:39:07  TYPE OF ACTIVITIES THAT OCCUR.
SO
20:39:10  THE CONSISTENCY CERTAINLY WOULD BE INTERESTING, BUT I THINK WHAT
20:39:13  WE TRY TO DO IS BE RESPONSIVE TO THE COMMUNITY NEEDS AND THE TYPE OF
20:39:16  ACTIVITIES THAT OCCUR IN THE PARK.

20:39:21 >> Ms. Wolf: I WOULD JUST ADD THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH WHAT WE DO WITH
20:39:24  OUR PARK SYSTEM AS WELL IN THE CITY AND THAT OUR COMMUNITY PARKS CLOSE
20:39:27  AT 10:00 P.M. AR WITH OUR NEIGHBORHOOD
20:39:30  PARKS CLOSE 30 MINUTES AFTER SUNSET.

20:39:34 >> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.
THAT'S ALL MY QUESTIONS FOR NOW.
I
20:39:37  HAVE MORE LATER BUT I KNOW WE'RE TRYING TO WATCH THE TIME TO TAKE
20:39:41  A BREAK.

20:39:45 >> Mayor Mei: AS I MENTIONED, I THINK WE'LL HAVE SOME
20:39:49  ADDITIONAL PUBLIC COMMENTS FOR SURE.
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, CLARIFY
20:39:51 ING QUESTIONS AND THEN WE'LL TAKE A BREAK FOR 10 MINUTES BEFORE WE RETURN.

20:39:55 TO PUBLIC SPEAKERS.
INTO
20:39:58 .
>> Councilmember Kassan: THANK YOU.
I'M WONDERING WHY THERE ISN'T
20:40:02  -- THERE'S NO FEE FOR PARKING
20:40:06 .
GIVEN THAT, YOU KNOW, WE ARE  TRYING TO --
20:40:09  THERE'S A COST TO FREE PARKING AND IT DOES
20:40:12  CAUSE PEOPLE TO GET ATTRACTED TO COME
20:40:15  AND TRY TO FIND FREE PARKING AND
20:40:18  OFTEN DRIVE AROUND AND AROUND LOOKING FOR FREE PARKING WHICH
20:40:21  IS POLLUTING AND ENCOURAGES PEOPLE TO MAYBE TAKE A CAR
20:40:25  WHEN THEY COULD HAVE OTHER OPTIONS, AND IT ALSO
20:40:28  ENCOURAGES PEOPLE TO GO TO THAT ENTRANCE AS OPPOSED TO THE OHLONE
20:40:31  ENTRANCE, WHERE THERE IS A CHARGE FOR PARKING
20:40:34  SO I'M WONDERING WHY ISN'T THERE A CHARGE FOR PARKING AND IS IT
20:40:37  RESPONSIBLE TO NOT CHARGE FOR PARKING?

20:40:41 >> WELL,
20:40:46  COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, IT A
20:40:50  FAIR QUESTION.
IN THE PARK WE DON'T OFTEN CHARGE
20:40:53  FOR AREAS THAT ARE PRIMARILY TRAIL ACCESS AS OPPOSED
20:40:56  TO OTHER DEVELOPED  PARKS, SO THAT'S CONSISTENT IN
20:40:59  OUR OTHER AREAS OF THE PARK DISTRICT.
THIS IS ALSO A VERY SMALL PORKING
20:41:02  PARKING AREA.
WE HAVE WORKED IN OTHER WAYS
20:41:05  COOPERATIVELY BETWEEN THE CITY AND THE PARK DISTRICT TO
20:41:08  REDUCE ACCESS AT THIS LOCATION
20:41:12 .
AS YOU MAY KNOW, THE
20:41:15  NEIGHBORHOOD USED TO BE SUBJECT TO ABOUT
20:41:20  5 LN OR 700 CARS THAT WOULD COME ON A
20:41:24  BUSY SPRING WEEKEND.
WE'VE NOW LIMITED THE TOTAL PARKING AVAILABLE TO
20:41:27  ABOUT 150 IN THIS AREA, AND I WAS LOOKING AT OUR TRAIL COUNTER
20:41:30  DATA EARLIER TODAY, AND
20:41:33  BETWEEN 2014 AND 2020, WE'VE
20:41:36  REDUCED THE VISITATION
20:41:39  THROUGH STANFORD BY ABOUT 44%
20:41:44  THROUGH 2019.
WE'LL LEAVE 2020 OUT OF IT BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW WHAT
20:41:48  THAT YEAR WAS KIND OF LIKE, BUT IF WE LOOK AT
20:41:51  2014 THROUGH 2019, WE REDUCED ACCESS ABOUT ABOUT
20:41:54  44%.
SO I THINK THAT'S PRETTY SIGNIFICANT IN TERMS OF RESPONDING TO THE CONCERN
20:41:57 S OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD.
AND ALSO JUST
20:42:01  THE SHEER VOLUME OF VISITATION AT THIS
20:42:04  SITE, SO YEAH, THIS IS PRETTY CONSISTENT
20:42:08  THROUGHOUT THE PARK DISTRICT FOR A HIKING-ONLY
20:42:11  ACCESS TO A REGIONAL PARK.
>> Ms. Wolf: I WOULD ALSO
20:42:14  ADD DURING THE PERMIT PARKING PROCESS, THIS ISSUE WAS LOOKED AT VERY CAREFULLY
20:42:18  AND IT WAS REALLY NOTED THAT THE CONCERN WAS THAT MORE PEOPLE WOULD
20:42:21  PARK IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD IF THERE WAS FEE
20:42:24  FOR PARKING IN THE 43 SPOTS AS OPPOSED TO THE
20:42:27  150 IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

20:42:37 >> Mayor Mei: IS THAT -- COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, IS THAT YOUR
20:42:40  LAST CLARIFYING QUESTION?
GREAT.
I SEE WITH HAVE SEVERAL HANDS RAISED
20:42:44  BUT I KNOW WE ARE VERY OVERDUE FOR THE BREAK, SO I'M GOING TO PAUSE RIGHT HERE
20:42:47  AND I'D ASK THAT WE TAKE A 10-MINUTE BREAK
20:42:51  FOR THE STENOCAPTIONER, AND IF YOU'RE GOING ON THE  BREAK,
20:42:54  I'D ASK ALL THE PEOPLE ON THE ZOOM TO PLEASE

THANK YOU.
WE'LL RETURN BACK IN

20:54:02 I'M GOING TO CALL THE MEETING 
BACK TO ORDER.

20:54:17 I SEE THAT WE'RE MISSING A FEW 
COUNCILMEMBERS

I THINK WE'LL HAVE A COUPLE OF 
PUBLIC SPEAKERS AT LEAST
20:54:25 .
SO IF WE COULD PLEASE COME BACK

20:54:28  WE CAN BRING
20:54:31

20:54:47 I THINK WE'RE MISSING
20:54:51  ONE 
COUNCILMEMBER STILL.
I'M GOING TO
20:54:54  GIVE IT ONE MORE 
MINUTE AND THEN WE'LL CALL
20:54:58  BACK 
TO ORDER.
AT THIS TIME I'D
20:55:01  ALSO LIKE TO

I'D
20:55:17  ALSO ASK THAT YOU HAVE UP

TILL THREE MINUTES I THINK 
BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN HERE SO
20:55:23  LONG 
THIS NIGHT BUT I'D ALSO ASK THAT 
WE KEEP
20:55:26  IT, IF YOU ARE THOUGHT 
NEEDING THE ENTIRE TIME YOU'RE
20:55:30  
NOT OBLIGATED TO IT AND TO 
PLEASE
20:55:33  CONSIDER COMMENTS YOU CAN 
SAY THAT YOU DISAGREE WITH 
ANOTHER SPEAKER
20:55:37 .
RATHER THAN REPEATING THEIR 
ENTIRE STATEMENT.
20:55:40 
SO I'D ASK THAT SO THAT WE CAN 
HAVE PRODUCTIVE
20:55:43  CONVERSATIONS.

20:55:48 WHAT, THIS TIME I'M GOING TO IS 
IT
20:55:52  COUNCILMEMBER KENG.
I THOUGHT I SAW COUNCILMEMBER 
KENG
20:55:55  OR COX, GREAT, EVERYONE 
ANSWER BACK THOUSAND.
SO I'M
20:55:58  CALLING THE MEETING BACK 
TO ORDER AND WE'LL BEGIN WITH 
THE
20:56:01  FIRST PUBLIC SPEAKER AND 
THAT IS
20:56:05  JANET BENS, WELCOME
20:56:08 .
>> THANK YOU, MAYOR MEI CITY 
COUNCIL
20:56:10  MEMBERS FOR THE 
OPPORTUNITY TO COMMENT ON THIS 
ITEM.

20:56:13 THERE ARE MANY FREMONT RESIDENTS 
THAT HAVE GRAVE CONCERNS ABOUT
20:56:16  
THE PROPOSED MISSION PEAK LEASE 
AND WE'RE URGING
20:56:20  THE CITY 
COUNCIL TO RECORRECT THE LEASE 
AS IT'S
20:56:23  CURRENTLY PROPOSED.
WE WILL HAVE A FEW SPEAKERS THIS 
EVENING WHO
20:56:26  WILL ADDRESS 
CONCERNS ON BEHALF
20:56:29  OF RESIDENTS 
IN AN EFFORT TO NOT MAKE
20:56:33  THE 
MEETING ANY LONGER.
THIS
20:56:37  PARTICULAR RESIDENCE IS 
OVERRUN AND ABUSED.
20:56:40 
IF THE LEASE IS TO BE RENEWED,
20:56:43  
IT MUST BE,
20:56:47  PROVIDE EFFECTIVE 
BALANCE GOING FORWARD.
SOME OF THE RESPONSES
20:56:49  IN THE 
GREEN SHEET WERE EXTREMELY 
CONCERNING.

20:56:52 WE URGE THE CITY NOT TO
20:56:55  
RELINQUISH EXCLUSIVE YELLOW TO 
THE PARK DISTRICT.

20:56:58 THIS IS CITY OWNED PROPERTY AND 
TO DATE THE DISTRICT HAS BEEN
20:57:01  
CHALLENGED TO ADDRESS MANY OF 
THE LINGERING ON
20:57:04 GOING ISSUES ALL 
OF WHICH ARE A DIRECT RESULT OF 
THE
20:57:07  OVERWHELMING NUMBER OF 
VISITORS TO THE STANFORD 
ENTRANCE
20:57:11 .
AS NOTED BY COUNCILMEMBERS 
COMMENTS THAT THE
20:57:15  BOARD MEETING 
ON NOVEMBER 2nd DIRECTOR 
COFFEE INSISTED
20:57:18  ON TERMS THAT 
WOULD ALLOW THE CITY
20:57:21  THE SUE THE 
DISTRICT IF THEY EVER INTERFERE 
WITH
20:57:25 , QUOTE UNQUOTE THEIR PARK.
FREMONT RESIDENTS
20:57:27  DESERVE 
BETTER.
THIS ISSUE NEEDS TO BE CLEARED 

20:57:30 UP.
THE ISSUE NEEDS TO BE
20:57:33  MANAGED 
DIFFERENTLY GOING FORWARD.
IT IS THE MOST
20:57:37  HEAVILY VISITED 
OF 70 PARKS
20:57:40  RECEIVING MORE THAN 
A QUARTER MILLION VISITORS A
20:57:43  
YEAR.
THE
20:57:47  STEWARDS COMMIT TO MANAGE IN 
SUCH A NATURE
20:57:50  AS ALL REGIONAL 
PARKS.
THIS IS A
20:57:53  HUGE PROBLEM.
THE LEASE
20:57:57  MUST, TO ENSURE THE 
LONG TERM HEALTH OF THE PRESERVE 
AND
20:58:01  TO ADDRESS THE ONGOING 
ISSUES.
THE LEASE
20:58:04  AS PROPOSED WILL 
CONTINUE WHAT IS NOW A FREE FOR 
ALL AT
20:58:07  THIS ENTRANCE.
WHAT'S NEEDED TO PROVIDE THE
20:58:11  
BALANCE POSTED HOURS FREFERRABLY 
8 A.M. TO
20:58:15  PREFERABLY
20:58:18  
8 A.M. TO SUNSET.
IF IT IS TO
20:58:22  MIGRATE VISIT TOORS 
20:58:25 ORS TO 
THIS AREA
20:58:28 , EFFECTIVE CURFEW 
MANAGEMENT AND AUTOMATIC
20:58:31  LOCKING 
GATE, SIMILAR TO WHAT THE PARK
20:58:34  
DISTRICT DOES AT ROUND VALLEY OR
20:58:38  
LEONA CANYON.
WE UNDERSTAND THERE WOULD BE
20:58:41  
HUMAN RESOURCES, THAT WOULD BE 
APPROPRIATE HERE
20:58:44 , UNLESS THE 
PARK DISTRICT RESCINDS THE EIR
20:58:48 , 
THERE IS NOTHING THAT PROHIBITS
20:58:51  
THE PARK DISTRICT, REJECT
20:58:54  THE 
LEASE AS PROPOSED AND INSIST ON 
TERMS
20:58:57  THAT PROVIDE EFFECTIVE 
BALANCE GOING FORWARD AND 
EFFECTIVELY
20:59:01  MIGRATE THE VISITORS 
THE OHLONE ENTRANCE AS
20:59:04  THE 
PRIMARY ENTRANCE IN FREMONT.
THANK YOU.
20:59:08 
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.
THE NEXT SPEAKER IS GOING TO BE
20:59:11  
RICHARD GODFREY.
WELCOME.

20:59:23 RICHARD, I APOLOGIZE, YOU'RE NOW 
ON MUTE.
20:59:25 
>> NOW CAN I BE HEARD?
THANK YOU.

20:59:28 SO I WISH TO MAKE SOME COMMENTS 
REGARDING
20:59:32  EAST BAY REGIONAL PARK 
SYSTEM HAVING HAD THE
20:59:35  PRIVILEGE 
TO SERVE ON THE PARK COMMISSION 
I FOLLOWED FOR
20:59:39  THE LAST EIGHT 
YEARS THE MANY CHALLENGES AND
20:59:41  
OCCASIONAL CONFLICTS THAT HAVE 
COME UP.

20:59:44 BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO 
REMEMBER THAT
20:59:47  EAST BAY REGIONAL 
PARKS IS A BLESSING TO OUR 
COUNTY.

20:59:50 IT IS ALSO TAKING CARE OF
20:59:53  AROUND 
125,000 ACRES.
AND IT'S WIDE
20:59:56 LY REGARDED AS ONE 
OF THE FINEST
20:59:59  REGIONAL PARK 
SYSTEMS IN THE UNITED STATES.
AND
21:00:03  PROBABLY EVEN WORLDWIDE.
SO TO HAVE AN
21:00:06  OPPORTUNITY TO BE 
SERVED BY A PARK SYSTEM OF
21:00:09  THIS 
CALIBER, I THINK, IS A GREAT 
OPPORTUNITY
21:00:13  FOR CITY OF FREMONT.
I THINK WE SHOULD LOOK TOWARDS
21:00:16  A 
COLLABORATIVE EFFORT AND 
CLEARLY, THERE ARE CHECKS AND
21:00:19  
BALANCES WITHIN THIS 25 YEAR 
LEASE TO DO SO.

21:00:22 SO I URGE ALL OF THOSE IN THE 
COUNCIL TO VOTE IN
21:00:26  FAVOR OF AN 
EXCELLENT OPPORTUNITY TO PARTNER
21:00:29  
WITH EAST BAY REGIONAL PARKS.
THANK YOU SO MUCH
21:00:33 .
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.
NEXT SPEAKER
21:00:36  IS GOING TO BE 
AJIT.

21:00:42 WELCOME.
21:00:46 
>> HI, THIS IS AJIT.
I'M
21:00:50  IN AGREEMENT WITH SPEAKER 
NUMBER 1.
I WOULD LIKE
21:00:53  THE COUNCILMEMBERS 
TO REJECT THE CURRENT LEASE AS
21:00:56  
STATED.
AND DO EVERYTHING IT CAN TO KEEP 

21:00:59 THE HEALTH AND QUALITY OF THE
21:01:03  
PRESERVE AT A HIGH STANDARD.
THANK YOU
21:01:05 .
BYE.
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

21:01:08 THE NEXT SPEAKER IS KELLY A
21:01:12 
ABRIEU.

21:01:15 >> I'M READING SOME PICTURES 
THAT WERE POSTED,
21:01:18  SOME SIGNS 
THAT WERE POSTED IN FRONT OF THE 
PARK
21:01:22  AS STANFORD AVENUE ON APRIL 
11th, 2020
21:01:25 .
THE SIGNS SAY PARK CLOSED.
I READ THOSE SIGNS.
21:01:29 
I CAN'T IGNORE THE OBVIOUS.
THEY DON'T
21:01:32  SAY STREET CLOSED.
THEY SAY PARK CLOSED.
21:01:35 
FACTS AND REALITY ARE BEING 
DISTORTED FOR
21:01:38  FREMONT RESIDENTS.
PUBLIC
21:01:41  OUTREACH IS CREDIBILITY 
IN DOUBT
21:01:45 .
CITY NEEDS A BALANCED APPROACH 
TO GOVERNANCE
21:01:48 .
THE PARK DISTRICT IS TAKING A 
MATURE
21:01:51  APPROACH AND THE CITY 
IS -- SEEMS
21:01:55  TO BE -- HAS LOST 
TOUCH
21:01:58  WITH REALITY AND FACTS.
WE JUST HEARD A BUNCH
21:02:01  OF 
CLARIFYING QUESTIONS WHICH 
PROPOSED SUBSTITUTE MOTIONS
21:02:05  LIKE 
A FIVE-YEAR PHASE-IN.
THIS IS FOR
21:02:07  CLARIFYING 
QUESTIONS.
IT IS NOT TO PROPOSE SUBSTITUTE 

21:02:11 MOTIONS.
THE CITY COUNCIL SEEMS TO HAVE A 
ONE SIDED
21:02:14  IMBALANCED APPROACH 
WHERE ONLY NEIGHBORHOOD CONCERNS 
ARE
21:02:19  BEING -- ARE RAISED.
NO REGARD FOR
21:02:22  VISITOR CONCERNS, 
NO REGARD FOR PUBLIC HEALTH, NO 
REGARD FOR
21:02:25  RECREATION.
THE NEED FOR RESTROOMS IS 
IGNORED
21:02:28 , YOU KNOW, WITH RUNNING 
WATER AND SEWAGE
21:02:32 .
THE STANDARDIZED PARK HOURS ARE
21:02:35  
5 A.M. TO 10 P.M.
THAT APPLIES
21:02:39  TO GERIN DRY CREEK
21:02:42 , 
LAKE CHABOT
21:02:45 , ALAMEDA CREEK TRAIL 
I COULD GO ON, 5
21:02:48  A.M. TO 10 P.M.
LET'S GO THROUGH THE LIST
21:02:52 .
QUARRY LAKES, PLEASANTON
21:02:56  LAKES, 
'TIL DON, ALAMEDA CREEK TRAIL.
21:02:59 
5 A.M. TO 10 P.M.
LET'S TALK ABOUT CLOSING THE
21:03:02  
PARK FOR HEALTH REASONS.
THE POLICE CHIEF IS NOT
21:03:05  A 
MEDICAL DOCTOR LAST I HEARD.
THE CITY WAS NEVER
21:03:07  IN 
COMMUNICATION WITH COUNTY HEALTH 
OFFICERS.

21:03:10 I CAN GIVE YOU THE NAME OF TWO 
OF THEM
21:03:13 , DR. FARNITANO
21:03:16  AND 
DR. PAN.
THEY WROTE IN 2020
21:03:20 , EAST BAY 
REGIONAL PARKS WE ENCOURAGE TO 
STAY
21:03:23  OPEN, THAT'S A QUOTE JUST 
PRINTED IN THE
21:03:26  NEWSPAPER.
MORE POLICE
21:03:29  SERVICE THAN OTHER 
NEIGHBORHOODS IN THE CITY, ALL 
THOSE
21:03:32  MEDICAL CALLS HIGHLIGHT 
THE IMPORTANCE OF DRINKING 
WATER, THE
21:03:36  OHLONE TRAIL HAD A 
FATALITY FOUR YEARS AGO AND THAT 
LED
21:03:40  TO THE INSTALLATION OF 
DRINKING WATER OVER THERE THAT 
AND A LOT
21:03:43  OF COMPLAINTS FROM 
VISITORS ABOUT LACK OF DRINKING 
WATER
21:03:46  AT OHLONE.
THE KEY ISSUE IS THAT THE 
REALITY IS
21:03:49  THAT THREE QUARTERS 
OF VISITORS USE
21:03:52  STANFORD AVENUE 
NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES YOU 
CALL IT MAIN, THE
21:03:56  OTHER ENTRANCE 
MAIN OR PRIMARY OR WHATEVER.
IT IS REALITY
21:03:59  DISTORTION AGAIN.
A BALANCED APPROACH
21:04:02  TO 
GOVERNANCE, SOME MATURE 
LEADERSHIP IS NEEDED
21:04:06 , 
DR. GODFREY WAS RIGHT.
THIS IS
21:04:09  A GREAT PARK.
A GREAT FACILITY.
THE
21:04:13  PARK DISTRICT IS OPERATING 
THIS AT NO COST
21:04:16  TO THE CITY.
THANK YOU.

21:04:22 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.
NEXT SPEAKER IS COLIN.

21:04:28 >> HELLO, CAN YOU HEAR ME?
>> Mayor Mei:   YES, PLEASE 
PROCEED
21:04:32 .
>> HI, I'VE BEEN LIVING NEXT TO 
THE
21:04:35  STANFORD PARKING LOT SINCE 
1996 SO I'VE
21:04:38  BEEN OVERLOOKING 
THE PARKING LOT SINCE THEN.
I WANT
21:04:41  TO TALK ABOUT BEFORE 2016
21:04:44  
FROM 96 TO 20
21:04:47 16.
THREE HELICOPTERS LANDING
21:04:50  IN 
MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT TO RESCUE 
NIGHT HIKERS
21:04:54  AND I'VE SEEN MANY, 
MANY EMERGENCY VEHICLES
21:04:58  SHOWING 
UP AT NIGHT, AGAIN RESCUING
21:05:01  THE 
NIGHT HIKERS AND I CAN SEE 
FLASHLIGHTS ON THE
21:05:04  TRAIL LIKE A 
STAR IN THE SKY BEFORE 2016
21:05:07 .
SO 90% OF THE PEOPLE DOING 
GREAT,
21:05:11  A FEW PEOPLE THEY WANT TO 
HIKE BEYOND,
21:05:14  WAY UNTIL MIDNIGHT.
SO SINCE
21:05:17  2016 THINGS GET A LOT 
BETTER NOW THANKS TO THE CITY 
AND
21:05:20  THE POLICE DEPARTMENT ALSO 
THE PARK DISTRICT THEY IMPROVE 
THE
21:05:23  ENVIRONMENT, SO IT'S GETTING 
A LOT BETTER.
SO I KNOW THERE ARE
21:05:26  A LOT OF 
ISSUES.
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT, I WANT
21:05:28  TO 
SAY SOME SUGGESTIONS.
OKAY?

21:05:31 I KNOW THE GATE IS HARD TO PUT 
IN.
21:05:35 
NOT REQUIRE LOTS OF MAINTENANCE 
BECAUSE IT'S ALWAYS OPEN RIGHT 

21:05:39 NOW.
SO I WANT TO SUGGEST MAYBE YOU 
CAN PUT A
21:05:42  PAY BOX FOR THE 
PARKING LOT.
21:05:45 
BECAUSE I THINK THE PARKS SAYING 
IT'S DIFFICULT
21:05:49  TO DO THE 
PARKINGS THINGS.
BUT TO BE EQUAL
21:05:52  WITH OHLONE 
COLLEGE MAYBE YOU CAN JUST LIKE 
A
21:05:55  CENTRAL PAYING BOX LIKE FOR 
PARKING YOU PUT A NUMBER ON THE
21:05:58  
LOT ON THE GROUND AND YOU PAY 
ACCORDING
21:06:01  TO YOUR LOT NUMBERS.
SO MAKE IT EQUAL
21:06:04  TO OHLONE 
COLLEGE.
AND ALSO ANOTHER IDEA
21:06:07  IS WITHOUT 
A GATE PARKING GO IN AND OUT,
21:06:10  WE 
CAN PUT IN LIKE A TRAFFIC CAMERA 
WHICH WHEN YOU GO
21:06:14  -- WHEN YOU 
RUN A RED LIGHT THEY CAN CATCH 
YOUR
21:06:17  LICENSE PLATE AND THEY CAN 
DETECT THE CAR SO THEY
21:06:20  CAN BE 
LIKE A LOW COST SOLUTION TO 
REDUCE THE CRIME RATE
21:06:23 .
ONE MORE THING IS, WHENEVER 
THERE'S AN ACCIDENT IN THE
21:06:26  PARK, 
THE CITY OF FREMONT IS PAYING 
FOR IT.

21:06:29 THE POLICE DEPARTMENT IS PAYING 
FOR THE WHOLE BAY AREA.
21:06:32 
IT'S NOT JUST THE
21:06:36  CITY ITSELF BY 
WAY OF COVERING THE WHOLE BAY 
AREA.

21:06:39 SO THE PARK JUST RUN THE PARK 
BUT THE CONSEQUENCES IS
21:06:41  THE CITY 
OF FREMONT IS TAKING THE BURDEN 
OF IT.

21:06:44 SO THANK YOU.
THAT'S IT
21:06:47 .
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU,
21:06:50  
COLIN.
NEXT SPEAKER IS KADEEP
21:06:54 .
WELCOME KADEEP.
>> YES,
21:06:57  MY NAME IS KALDIT
21:07:01  AND 
FIRST OF ALL I'D LIKE TO THANK 
YOU THE COUNCILMEMBERS FOR
21:07:04  
LISTENING TO MY CONCERNS.
A COUPLE OF THESE
21:07:07  HAVE ALREADY 
BEEN ADDRESSED BUT I FEEL LIKE 
25 YEAR LEASE
21:07:10  IS WAY TOO LONG.
IT SHOULD BE MAYBE A MAXIMUM
21:07:13  OF 
TEN YEAR, 15 YEARS, WITH REVIEW
21:07:17 S 
EVERY THREE TO FIVE YEARS.
AND THAT
21:07:20  THOSE REVIEWS, THOSE 
SHOULD BE OPEN TO THE
21:07:24  PUBLIC.
SO WE CAN ALSO GIVE OUR INPUT AS 
TO
21:07:29  HOW THE PARK IS BEING RUN
21:07:32 .
FOR THE EXTENSION OF THE LEASE 
INSTEAD OF MAKING A ONE
21:07:35 , 25 YEAR 
OPTION TO EXTEND IT, WHY
21:07:38  NOT 
MAKE IT
21:07:42  FIVE, FIVE-YEAR OPTIONS 
OR MAYBE THREE
21:07:45 , TEN YEAR 
OPTIONS.
21:07:48 
WHY IS THE OPTION JUST ONE 
25-YEAR?
21:07:51 
THAT DOESN'T MAKE A LOT OF SENSE 
TO ME.

21:07:54 FROM WHAT I'VE HEARD IT SEEMS 
LIKE WE'RE GIVING WAY
21:07:57  TOO MUCH 
CONTROL TO EAST BAY REGIONAL 
PARKS
21:08:00 .
YOU KNOW, OUR WHOLE GOVERNMENT 
IS SET
21:08:03  UP ON CHECKS AND 
BALANCES.
AND I
21:08:07  THINK THERE'S NO CHECKS 
AND BALANCES HERE.
WE'RE JUST
21:08:10  GIVING THEM A 
FREEHAND TO DO WHATEVER THEY
21:08:14  
WANT WITHOUT HAVING ANY TYPE OF 
REVIEWS
21:08:18  THAT THE PUBLIC CAN 
SPEAK ON.
AND THEN ALSO
21:08:21 , THE SECOND ITEM 
IS, IF WE DO WANT
21:08:24  TO INCREASE 
THE TRAFFIC FROM
21:08:27  OHLONE COLLEGE, 
IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE
21:08:31  THAT 
WE'RE CHARGING FROM THE OHLONE
21:08:34  
COLLEGE $
21:08:37  $4 PER CAR OR WHATEVER 
IT IS AND NOT CHARGING ANYTHING
21:08:41  
FROM THE STANFORD SIDE.
SO IF WE WANT TO DIVERT
21:08:44  THE 
TRAFFIC MORE TOWARD
21:08:47  OHLONE 
COLLEGE MAYBE WE NEED TO NOT 
HAVE THAT FEE
21:08:51  FOR OHLONE 
COLLEGE.
IF WE CAN'T INTRODUCE A
21:08:54  FEE FROM 
THE STANFORD SIDE.
SO THOSE ARE JUST
21:08:57  SOME 
SUGGESTIONS THAT I HAD.
AND I STILL HAVE
21:09:01  A MINUTE BUT 
I'LL GIVE THAT TO SOMEBODY ELSE
21:09:04 .
THANK YOU.
21:09:14 
>> Mayor Mei:   NEXT SPEAKER IS 
SUSIE C
21:09:17 LAXTON.
WELCOME.
21:09:20 
>> THANK YOU, GLAD TO BE ABLE TO 
COME IN ON THIS CONVERSATION.
21:09:23 
I KNOW RICH GODFREY.
WE WORK
21:09:27  TOGETHER ON A NUMBER OF 
ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES AROUND
21:09:31  
THE -- OUR AREA IN FREMONT.
AND I'M
21:09:34  THE CURRENT PARK 
ADVISORY
21:09:38  COMMITTEE MEMBER IN THE 
SLOT
21:09:43  THAT RICH USED TO OCCUPY
21:09:46 .
SO I'M INVOLVED WITH THE EAST 
BAY PARKS
21:09:49  FROM THAT POINT OF 
VIEW.
I'VE ALSO BEEN A DOCENT
21:09:53  FOR 
ABOUT SEVEN YEARS NOW,
21:09:56  AT THE 
COYOTE HILLS PARK.

21:09:59 I'M A CALIFORNIA NATURALIST.
I HAVE A LOVE FOR NATURE
21:10:02  AND A 
LOVE FOR HIKING AND BEING 
OUTDOORS.
21:10:05 
AND I JUST
21:10:08  WANT TO ECHO WHAT 
RICH SAID AND SOME OTHERS HAVE 
SAID
21:10:12  THAT WE ARE REALLY 
FORTUNATE TO HAVE THIS
21:10:15  OUTDOOR 
SPACE FOR EVERYBODY TO ENJOY AND 
THE EAST BAY PARKS
21:10:18  IS A JEWEL.
IT'S A JEWEL OF
21:10:21  AN -- OF A 
REGIONAL PARK.
THE
21:10:24  LIKES OF WHICH ARE NOT
21:10:27  
ANYWHERE FOUND IN THE COUNTRY.
21:10:32 
THEY WIN AWARDS, THEY WIFN 
GRANTS,
21:10:35  WIN 
GRANTS,
21:10:39  THEY RUN THEIR PARKS 
VERY WELL AND I DO UNDERSTAND
21:10:42  
THE CONCERNS THE RESIDENTS HAVE 
BROUGHT UP AND I
21:10:46  DO SYMPATHIZE 
TO THE FACT THAT
21:10:49  SOME PARK 
VISITORS AREN'T AS POLITE AS
21:10:53  
THEY SHOULD BE IN TERMS OF THEIR 
NOISE LEVELS AND BEING IN THE
21:10:56  
PARK AFTER CURFEW.
SO THAT IS REGRETTABLE
21:10:59 .
THE PARK WAS THERE BEFORE THE
21:11:02  
NEIGHBORHOOD WAS THERE.
AND I REMEMBER VISITING THE PARK
21:11:05  
BEFORE THAT
21:11:09  NEIGHBOR, WAS 
ACTUALLY SHOCKED
21:11:13  WHEN THAT HUGE 
NEIGHBORHOOD WENT
21:11:16  IN, SUCH CLOSE
21:11:19  
PROXIMITY.
I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THAT IT
21:11:23  
WOULD CAUSE SUCH CONSTERN NATION 
TO THE
21:11:27  NEIGHBORHOOD BEFORE IT 
WENT IN.
I THINK SOMEHOW WITH HOW THE
21:11:30  
CITY HAS PROPOSED
21:11:33  TO WORK WITH 
EAST BAY PARK, COLLABORATE
21:11:36  WITH 
THESE LIAISON MEETINGS AND SUCH, 
I THINK
21:11:39  THEY PROBABLY REQUEST 
ADDRESS ISSUES AS THEY COME UP.
21:11:43 
AND THE COMMENTS ABOUT PARKING 
FEES, MAKING
21:11:46  IT EQUAL, AT OHLONE 
THAT'S A GOOD POINT
21:11:49 .
MAYBE THERE IS SOME WAY THAT 
THAT CAN BE DONE.

21:11:52 SO THAT THERE'S ZERO PARKING FEE 
AT OHLONE
21:11:56 .
THOSE ARE MY COMMENTS AND THANKS 
SO MUCH
21:12:00 .
21:12:13 
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU NEXT 
SPEAKER
21:12:16  IS SANJAY.
>> THANK YOU
21:12:19  MY NAME IS SANJAY.
21:12:22 
I THINK EAST BAY PARK DISTRICT 
HAS NOT
21:12:26  BEEN FAIR FIMPLEG ISSUES
21:12:29 
ISSUES.
SAYING IN THEIR OWN BOARD 

21:12:32 MEETING THAT THIS IS THEIR PARK 
AND THEY DON'T WANT THE
21:12:36  CITY OF 
FREMONT INTERFERING WITH THAT.
21:12:39 
ANY CONSTRUCTIVE FEEDBACK THE 
LOCAL RESIDENTS HAVE
21:12:42  GIVEN HAS 
BEEN MET WITH SIMILAR ATTITUDE
21:12:45  
FROM THE PARK DISTRICT OVER THE 
LAST 15 TO 20 YEARS.
21:12:49 
THREE EXAMPLES, FAILURE TO 
MAINTAIN HOURS OF
21:12:52  ENTRANCE.
NOTE THE FIRE THAT WAS CAUSED IN 
MISSION
21:12:55  PEAKER ACTUALLY BEHIND 
MY HOUSE TWO TIMES WAS HAPPENING
21:12:58  
WHEN THE PARK WAS CLOSED AND AT 
THAT TIME THERE WERE VISITORS
21:13:01  TO 
THE PARK.
LUCKILY THE WEATHER CONDITIONS 

21:13:05 WERE FAVORABLE OTHERWISE IT 
COULD HAVE TURNED VERY NASTY AND 
DESTROYED A
21:13:08  LOT OF HOMES AND 
MANY, MANY LIVES IF
21:13:12  IT HADN'T 
HAPPENED, IF THE WEATHER 
CONDITIONS ARE NOT
21:13:15  FAVORABLE.
OKAY?
AND THEY HAVE NOT -- REPEATED
21:13:18 LY 
WE'VE TOLD THEM ABOUT 
MAINTAINING HOURS AND THEY 

21:13:22 IGNORED IT.
ALSO MAINTENANCE.
RECALL IN 2016,
21:13:25  17, THE GRAVEL 
THAT
21:13:28  WAS NOT GRAVEL ON ENTRANCE
21:13:31 S 
AND TRAILS AND IT WAS PAINFUL 
DURING
21:13:34  RAINY SEASONS.
THEY CLAIM THEY WANT
21:13:37  TO MAKE 
OHLONE THE MAIN ENTRANCE BUT IT 
IS HARDER
21:13:41  BECAUSE THEY DON'T 
WANT TO.
UNTIL RECENTLY, OKAY
21:13:44 , ONLY 
RECENTLY THEY CHANGED THE 
MARKETING TO
21:13:47  MARK OHLONE AS THE 
MAIN ENTRANCE, OKAY AND THIS IS 
ONLY BECAUSE
21:13:50  THE LEASE IS UNDER 
REVIEW.
I BELIEVE THE LANGUAGE IN A LOT 

21:13:55 OF THE LEAF LETS
21:13:59 LETS, THEY
21:14:02  SHOULD 
ALLOW ANYBODY TO
21:14:07  VISIT AT ANY 
TIME.
THIS SHOULD BE PUBLIC LANDS THAT 

21:14:11 ANYBODY SHOULD BE ABLE TO VISIT.
EVEN LANGUAGE THAT
21:14:15  SAYS 
RESIDENTS SHOULD PARK
21:14:18  IN THE 
GARAGES OR DRIVEWAYS.
21:14:21 
AND VISITORS SHOULD USE PUBLIC
21:14:24  
STREETS.
WE SHOULD
21:14:28  LOU RESIDENTS OHAVE 
VISIT TOORS THEIR OWN HOMES
21:14:31 .
I THINK TO GIVE THEM LEASE 
WITHOUT
21:14:34  CONDITIONS IS 
RIDICULOUS.
YOU NEED FIVE YEAR
21:14:37  LEASE, PUT A 
PARKING PERMIT, PARKING
21:14:40  FEES AT 
THE ENTRANCE OF STANFORD
21:14:44  AND 
ALSO AT INTERLOCK AN
21:14:47  STANFORD 
AVENUE SO THAT ACTUALLY, THIS
21:14:49  
ENCOURAGES PEOPLE TO GO TO 
OHLONE.

21:14:52 YOU NEED TO MAKE THESE CHANGES 
BEFORE YOU SIGN SUCH A LEASE AND
21:14:55  
PLEASE DO NOT SIGN THIS LEASE.
MAKE IT MAXIMUM
21:14:58  FIVE YEARS 
RENEWABLE AND MAKE SOME CHANGES 
SO THAT THE PARK
21:15:01  DISTRICT WILL 
BE REASONABLE.
THEY HAVE A PHILOSOPHY THAT THIS 

21:15:05 IS THEIR LAND AND THEY CAN DO 
AWAY THE HELL THEY
21:15:08  LIKE WITH IT.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

21:15:13 >> Mayor Mei:   NEXT SPEAKER IS 
TINGE
21:15:20  
TING LEE.
WELCOME TING.
21:15:23 
>> TINK LEE, I'M A RESIDENT AT 
THE VINEYARD
21:15:26  HEIGHTS COMMUNITY.
I'M A LANDSCAPER, HAVE 
EXPERIENCE FOR
21:15:29  SEVEN YEARS AND I 
ALSO HELPED DESIGN PUBLIC PARKS 
FOR
21:15:33  A LIVING AND DEVELOP PARKS 
MASTER PLANS
21:15:36 , FOR THE CITY, 
WORKSHOPS
21:15:39  STUFF LIKE THAT 
COLLABORATE.
BUT I DON'T SEE
21:15:42  ANYWHERE WHERE 
THERE'S GOING TO BE COMMUNITY 
INPUT IN REGARDS
21:15:46  TO THE, YOU 
KNOW,
21:15:49  PARK MAINTENANCE, AND THE 
FACT
21:15:53  THAT WHATEVER -- WHAT WAS
21:15:56  
SAID BY COUNCILMEMBER JENNY
21:16:00  
KASSAN AND RAJ
21:16:03  SALWAN, IS VERY 
TELLING ABOUT
21:16:06  EAST BAY REGIONAL 
PARKS.
THE LANGUAGE IN THE CONTRACT 

21:16:09 SEEMS A LITTLE FRIGHTENING, THE 
FACT THAT THEY HAVE
21:16:12  EXCLUSIVE 
CONTROL.
THAT THE FACT THAT
21:16:16  THERE IS -- 
THEY CAN FORCE HOURS, WHENEVER
21:16:19  
THEY WANT, TO ME
21:16:24  THERE IS NOT 
ENOUGH COLLABORATIVE COMMUNITY 
EFFORT
21:16:27  IN THEIR PART.
21:16:30 
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, THERE WAS 
OBVIOUSLY A LIST OF NEIGHBORHOOD
21:16:32  
CONCERNS WITH REQUESTS FROM THE 
PRESENTATION BUT THERE'S NO 

21:16:36 CORRELATION WITH HOW THE EAST 
BAY REGIONAL PARK EFFORTS
21:16:40  WERE 
PROVIDE HE.
SO I THINK
21:16:43  THAT NEEDS TO BE MORE 
SPECIFIED.
MORE TARGETED
21:16:47  TOWARDS OUR LOCAL 
NEIGHBORHOOD SITUATION
21:16:51 .
AND THE FACT THAT ROUTINE
21:16:55  
MAINTENANCE PROTOCOLS SEEMS A 
LITTLE LIGHT IN TERMS
21:16:58  OF THE 
FACT THAT IT'S IN THE 
NEIGHBORHOOD PARK AND THERE ARE
21:17:02  
CERTAIN, YOU KNOW, INSTANCES 
THAT
21:17:05  WOULDN'T NEED TO BE 
ADDRESSED, I THINK
21:17:09  THAT WE CAN 
ALSO INSTALL LIKE ROLLING GATES
21:17:13  
OR SOMETHING A
21:17:17  LITTLE BIT EASIER 
TO MAINTAIN, YOU CAN GET 
CREATIVE
21:17:21  INSTALLING DIFFERENT 
GATE TYPES, NOT SOMETHING
21:17:24  
INEFFECTIVE OR SOMETHING WITH 
HEAVY MAINTENANCE.

21:17:27 SO IN LIGHT OF THIS I REALLY 
DON'T THINK THAT THE CITY
21:17:30  SHOULD 
APPROVE THIS CONTRACT
21:17:33  AND LEASE 
AGREEMENT.
I FEEL LIKE THERE
21:17:36  NEEDS TO BE 
MORE SPECIFIC
21:17:40  DETAILS THAN WERE 
HIGHLIGHTED BY THE 
COUNCILMEMBERS
21:17:43  IN THE BEGINNING.
THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei:  
21:17:46  THANK YOU.
NEXT SPEAKER
21:17:51  IS HAKUN CHEN.
>> YES
21:17:55 , CAN YOU HEAR ME?
>> Mayor Mei:   YES, PLEASE 
PROCEED.
21:17:58 
>> YES, FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU 
FOR
21:18:01  HONORING THE VETERANS 
TONIGHT.
MY NAME
21:18:04  IS PRAKUN CHEN, I'M 
PRESIDENT
21:18:08  OF THE HOA WHICH HAS 
ABOUT 18 HOMES IN
21:18:11  THIS AREA.
RECENTLY,
21:18:14  THE COURT SUBJECT TO 
THE TERMS OF THIS LEASE,
21:18:17  THE 
PARK DISTRICT SHOULD HAVE 
EXCLUSIVE
21:18:21  CONTROL OVER THE 
PROPERTY AND SOLE AUTHORITY TO 
MANAGE THE PROPERTY
21:18:24 .
I'M NOT GOING TO QUOTE 
EVERYTHING
21:18:28  DIRECTOR COFFEE SAID 
TO SAVE US TIME.
MAY I SUGGEST
21:18:31  WE REDACT THE 
SECTION FROM THE
21:18:34  LEASE, NO 
LONGER BE CONTENTIOUS ISSUES
21:18:37  FOR 
BOARD PARTIES.
REGARDING ITEM 3, THE PARK
21:18:41  
DISTRICT SHALL MAINTAIN THE 
PROPERTY IN AT LEAST A
21:18:44  CLEAN AND 
PRESENTABLE
21:18:48  CONDITION AS 
RECEIVED.
THE PARK WAS
21:18:51  SUBJECT TO MANY 
DETERIORATION,
21:18:55  INCLUDING LARGE 
FOOT TRAFFIC.
THE LEASE SHOULD
21:18:58  INCLUDE SOME 
CLAUSE REGARDING CONSERVATION 
AND
21:19:01  RESTORATION OF THE PARK.
TRAIL USED TO BE ONE
21:19:04  PERSON WIDE 
IS NOW A CAR WIDE.
MISSION
21:19:08  PEAK AS STATED IS ONE OF 
THE MOST POPULAR
21:19:11  PARKS IN THE 
EAST BAY AREA.
HAVING A LEASE THAT'S 25
21:19:14  YEARS 
LONG WITHOUT SPELLING OUT ANY
21:19:18  
TERMS FOR CONSERVING OR 
RESTORING THE PARK SEEMS LIKE A
21:19:21  
DISASTER WAITING TO HAPPEN.
WHO CAN PREDICT
21:19:24  25 YEARS AGO 
WHEN THE FIRST LEASE WAS SIGNED 
THAT THE TRAFFIC
21:19:28  AT MISSION PEAK 
WOULD BE THIS HIGH?
IF THE
21:19:31  PARK POPULARITY CONTINUES 
TO INCREASE THERE SHOULD BE
21:19:34  SOME 
COST TO EAST BAY REGIONAL PARKS
21:19:38  
TO PRESERVE THE PARK.
DON'T GET ME WRONG
21:19:41 , I'M ACTUALLY 
AN BE AFFIDAVIT HIKE
21:19:48  AVID HIKER AND
21:19:51  LOVE THIS 
PARK.
FOR THOSE WHO HAVE DONE BACKPACK
21:19:54 
BACKPACKING AS A BOY SCOUT 
ASSISTANT MANAGER I ALWAYS
21:19:57  TEACH 
A SCOUT TO LEAVE A PLACE BETTER 
THAN WE FOUND IT
21:20:01 .
EAST BAY REGIONAL PARK SHOULD 
MAKE SURE THE
21:20:04  LEASE INCLUDES 
CLAUSE THAT WOULD DO RESTORATION 
AN
21:20:07  PRESERVE THE LAND SO LET'S 
PUT THAT IN WRITING.
REGARDING THE PARKING
21:20:10  LOT I'M 
VERY GLAD TO HEAR THAT CURRENTLY 
THERE IS NO INTENTION TO
21:20:13  BUILD.
BUT ONCE GLEN THERE IS NOTHING 
WRITTEN IN THE
21:20:16  LEASE.
IF YOU RENT
21:20:20  SOMEPLACE YOU'RE 
ATENANT AND SAY YOU SHOULD NOT 
SMOKE YOU DON'T
21:20:23  CROSS YOUR HEART 
AND HOPE TO DIE AND SAY THEY'RE 
GOING TO OBEY
21:20:25 .
RIGHT?
YOU WRITE THAT RIGHT IN THE 

21:20:29 LEASE AND SPECIFICALLY SPELL IT 
OUT SO LET'S PUT THAT
21:20:32  IN THE 
WRITING.
REGARDING THE CURFEW VIOLATIONS,
21:20:36  
I BELIEVE THE NEIGHBORS ARE AT 
THIS POINT TIRED
21:20:39  OF CALLING THE 
POLICE SO THAT'S WHY YOU'RE NOT 
GETTING A LOT
21:20:42  OF THE INCIDENT 
REPORTS.
I URGE THAT THE POLICE COME
21:20:46  OUT 
HERE EVERY NIGHT AND OBSERVE
21:20:49  IT 
FOR YOURSELF.
THE LEASE
21:20:52  IS VERY VAGUE ON MANY 
POINTS, LET'S PUT THAT IN
21:20:55  WRITE 
AND BE CLEAR TO HAVE A GOOD 
CONTRACT.
21:20:58 
THANK YOU FOR THAT.
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU, NEXT 

21:21:02 SPEAKER IS VERONICA PANG.
IF THERE'S
21:21:05  SOMETHING YOU AGREE 
WITH ANOTHER SPEAKER PLEASE LET 
US KNOW AND
21:21:08  THAT WOULD BE 
HELPFUL.
THANK YOU.

21:21:11 >> HELLO, THIS IS VERONICA FANG
21:21:14  PANG, 
WE
21:21:18  ARE DISAPPOINTED THAT AFTER A 
YEAR'S
21:21:22  NEGOTIATIONEN THE LEASE 
THERE HAS BEEN
21:21:25  LITTLE CHANGE.
THE PARK DISTRICT HASN'T BEEN 
HELD
21:21:28  ACCOUNTABLE.
CURFEW VIOLATIONS ARE RAMPANT 
ONLY
21:21:31  THAT THEY ARE SELDOM 
SPOTTED BY PARK POLICE
21:21:35 .
THAT IS WHY THE NUMBER IS LOW.
I.T. SESSION ON
21:21:38 IT SAYS ON
21:21:41  THE CONTRACT, THE 
OHLONE LEASE WILL BE
21:21:44  A PRIMARY 
ENTRANCE, OHLONE IS
21:21:47  A WIN WIN 
THAT WE HAVE BEEN ADVOCATE BEING 
FOR MANY YEARS.
21:21:51 
BUT OBJECTIVE THAT THE PARK 
DISTRICT HAS BEEN WORKING TO US
21:21:54  
IN THE PAST YEARS?
IT HAS NOT BEEN SUCCESSFUL
21:21:57  
BECAUSE STANFORD IS FREE AND 
OHLONE CHARGES A PARKING FEE
21:22:00  AND 
MAP APPS KEEP DIRECTING VISITORS
21:22:04  
TO THE STANFORD ENTRANCE.
HOW SUCCESSFUL THIS MIGRATION
21:22:07  
CAN BE EVEN IF IT SAYS
21:22:11  THAT 
OHLONE WILL BE MADE THE PRIMARY 
ENTRANCE
21:22:15 ?
21:22:18 
WHAT IF THE
21:22:22  MIGRATION CONTINUES 
TO FAIL?
HOW DO YOU CHANGE
21:22:25  GOOGLE TO 
PRIORITIZE OHLONE COLLEGE AS
21:22:28  THE 
PRIMARY ENTRANCE?
AS LONG AS
21:22:31  STANFORD IS LISTED AS
21:22:35  
AN
21:22:38  ENTRANCE, IN ORDER
21:22:41  TO MAKE 
THE MIGRATION HAPPEN.
THE LEASE SHOULD
21:22:44  INCLUDE A PLAN 
AND TIME LINE FOR THE ENTRANCE 
BE
21:22:47  REMOVED FROM THE MAP APPS.
ANOTHER SOLUTION IS TO
21:22:51  MAKE 
STANFORD A BIKE AND PEDESTRIAN 
ONLY ENTRANCE.
21:22:55 
ALL VEHICULAR TRAFFIC SHOULD GO 
TO OHLONE.
21:22:58 
THIS WILL EFFECTIVELY REMOVE 
STANFORD
21:23:01  FROM THE MAP APPS.
YET THE SOLUTION IS TO START
21:23:04  
CHARGING A TEE FOR THE CARS 
PARKED AROUND THE
21:23:07  STANFORD 
NEIGHBORHOOD ON THE STREETS.
PAINT THE SPACES AND PUT
21:23:10  A PAIM 
KIOSK THERE.
THE CHARGE MUST
21:23:14  BE HIGHER THAN 
THE CHARGE AT OHLONE TO
21:23:17  
ENCOURAGE MIGRATION TO OHLONE.
DIRECTOR
21:23:20  AT THE EAST BAY PARK 
BOARD MEETING
21:23:23  ON NOVEMBER 2nd 
REQUESTED TO GET A COST ESTIMATE 
FOR A
21:23:27  NEW BATHROOM AT STANFORD 
BEFORE THE INK
21:23:30  WAS EVEN DRY ON 
THE LEASE.
THIS DID NOT REFLECT
21:23:34  THE 
INTENTION OF THE LEASE.
IF THERE IS NO PLANS TO BUILD 

21:23:37 THE PARKING LOT PLEASE PUT IT 
DOWN IN WRITING.
TO
21:23:40  MAKE THE OHLONE ENTRANCE 
ATTRACTIVE IMPROVEMENT
21:23:43  SHOULD BE 
MADE ON THAT SIDE INSTEAD.
CONCRETE SOLUTION
21:23:46 S SHOULD BE 
SPELLED OUT ON THE LEASE TO MAKE 
THE MIGRATION
21:23:50  EFFECTIVE.

21:23:53 THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU,
21:23:57  NEXT 
SPEAKER IS TONY
21:24:00  PANG.
TONY, PLEASE UNMUTE YOURSELF AND
21:24:03  
AGAIN AS I MENTIONED IF YOU 
SUPPORT OR ECHO
21:24:06  ANY ONE ELSE 
PLEASE LET US KNOW, THAT WOULD 
BE EASIER
21:24:09  FOR US TO GO THROUGH.
>> GOOD EVENING.
21:24:13 
MAYOR MEI AND CITY COUNCIL 
MEMBERS, LAST YEAR
21:24:16  AT THE HEIGHT 
OF THE PANDEMIC HIKERS WERE 
CONGREGATE
21:24:19 INGS ON PARK TRAILS AND 
NOT FOLLOWING SOCIAL DISTANCING
21:24:22  
RULES, GOING MASKLESS
21:24:26 , RESTROOMS 
WERE LOCKED UP, HUMAN WASTE 
SPILLED ON
21:24:29  THE STREETS AND 
GARBAGE BINS OVERFLOWING
21:24:32 .
THIS BECAME A PUBLIC HEALTH 
ISSUE
21:24:36  AND CITY COUNCIL TOOK 
ACTION ON THE
21:24:41  STANFORD ENTRANCE 
WHICH APPRECIATES IT.
AT
21:24:44  THE PEAK OF THE PANDEMIC, 
EXTREMELY
21:24:47  CONCERNED THE PARK 
DISTRICT HAS BEEN
21:24:50  GIVEN 
EXCLUSIVE RIGHT TO MANAGE 
MISSION
21:24:54  PEAK LEASE.
HEAVEN
21:24:57  FORBID ANOTHER PANDEMIC, 
THE CITY'S HANDS ARE TIDE
21:25:00 , AND 
DESPITE OBJECTION HE FROM 
NEIGHBORS, THE DISTRICT
21:25:04  WILL 
STILL HAVE THE FINAL SAY.
THE OPTION TO
21:25:07  HOLD COMMUNITY 
MEETINGS ABOUT PARK HOURS IS
21:25:10  
IRRELEVANT.
THE COMMUNITY HAS BEEN GIVING 

21:25:13 INPUT ON PARK HOURS FOR YEARS.
BACK IN 2018
21:25:16 , PARK DISTRICT 
ATTEMPTED TO
21:25:20  EXTEND CLOSING 
HOURS ON STANFORD AVENUE TO 10
21:25:23  
P.M.
OUR MAYOR HAD TO PEN A LETTER TO 

21:25:26 THE DISTRICT TO STOP THEM.
THIS IS WHY WE SHOULD
21:25:31  NEVER 
CAPITULATE
21:25:34  TO DISTRICT DEMAND 
FOR NEW LEASE.
WE
21:25:38  HAVE WAITED EIGHT YEARS TO 
COME UP WITH A WORK
21:25:41 ABLE SOLUTION 
FOR STANFORD STAGING AREA.
I'M DISAPPOINTED DISTRICT HAS
21:25:45  
COME UP EMPTY AGAIN IN A NEW 
LEASE NEGOTIATION.

21:25:48 IT'S TIME TO INSTALL AN
21:25:51  
AUTOMATIC GATE, TO
21:25:54  DETER CURFEW 
VIOLATORS AND SHOULD BE
21:25:57  
FEASIBLE.
IF WE MANAGE TO PUT A MAN ON THE 

21:26:00 MOON AND WE ARE PART OF SILICON 
VALLEY PARK DISTRICT
21:26:03  HAS NOT 
BEEN HELD ACCOUNTABLE SO FAR
21:26:06  FOR 
21:26:10  
DERELICTION OF DUTY.
THIS IS WHY THE
21:26:13  CITY CANNOT 
AFFORD A LEASE WITHOUT
21:26:16  CLEAR 
TERMS IN WRITING, PROTECTING THE 
RIGHTS
21:26:20  TO GET INVOLVED WHEN 
NEEDED, AFTER ALL CITY OWNS THE
21:26:23  
LAND, THANK YOU FOR L
21:26:27  LISTENING.

21:26:31 >> Mayor Mei:   ALL RIGHT, NEXT 
SPEAKER IS de
21:26:34  SHANT.
>> GOOD EVENING, LIKE MANY
21:26:37  OF 
THE OTHERS HAVE COMMENTED, I TOO 
ASK
21:26:40  THE CITY COUNCIL TO REJECT 
THE MISSION PEAK
21:26:43  STANFORD 
ENTRANCE LEASE AS PRESENTED BY 
EAST BAY REGIONAL
21:26:47  PARK DISTRICT.
LIKE WE'VE HEARD FROM MANY 
PEOPLE BEFORE AS
21:26:50  WELL, PEOPLE 
ARE COMPLETELY DISREGARDING ANY 
KIND OF PARK
21:26:54 ING AT STANFORD 
ENTRANCE AT MISSION
21:26:57  PEAK BECAUSE 
IT IS AVAILABLE FOR FLEE.
THEY
21:27:01  PARK ANY TIMES, DRIVING IN 
A MANNER THAT IS IR
21:27:04 RESPONSIBLE 
AND COMING EARLIER THAN ALLOWED 
LIKE 5 A.M. IN THE
21:27:07  MORNING.
BECAUSE OF THE RAMPANT DISREGARD 
TO PARK HOURS
21:27:10  AND KEEPING THE 
STANFORD ENTRANCE
21:27:13  OPEN TO HOARD
21:27:16 S 
OF HIKERS, THE PARK
21:27:19 ING SITUATION 
IS A COMPLETE MESS.
THE PERMIT PARKING
21:27:23  HAS MADE 
LITTLE TO NO DIFFERENCE IN THE 
WAY IT HAS
21:27:26  BEEN OPERATIONALIZED.
THE CITY NEEDS TO TAKE
21:27:30  STRONG 
STEPS TO MAKE STANFORD A PAID 
PARKING.
21:27:33 
THAT WHOLE STRCH OF VINEYARD
21:27:36  
AVENUE NEEDS TO BE MADE PARKING 
ONLY, ABSOLUTELY
21:27:40  NO DIFFERENCE 
TO THE HIKERS WHO PARK ON EVERY 
INCH
21:27:44  OF THE AVENUE COMPLETELY 
DISREGARDING
21:27:47  THE NO PARKING 
BOARDS.
ALSO THE CITY NEEDS TO
21:27:50  MAKE 
PERMIT PARKING 24-7
21:27:53  AND NOT JUST 
FOR THE WEEKENDS AND
21:27:56  HOLIDAYS.
THE STANFORD MISSION
21:27:59  PEAK 
ENTRANCE IS OPEN AT ALL TIMES 
AND NOT
21:28:04  JUST ENTRANCE.
CHARGING $6
21:28:07  PER CAR AT STANFORD 
ENTRANCE SO PEOPLE WHO
21:28:10  CLAIM 
THEY COME HERE FOR BEAUTY AND 
NOT BECAUSE IT'S
21:28:13  FREE, CAN THEN 
START TO PAY FOR
21:28:16  ENJOYING IT.
ALSO FOR WHAT
21:28:19  THEY PAY FOR ALL 
OTHER EAST BAY PARKS THAT CHARGE 
PARK
21:28:23 ING FEES.
THANK YOU.

21:28:28 >> Mayor Mei:   NEXT SPEAKER IS

21:28:45 
ASHOOK YOU ARE ON MUTE STILL.
THANK YOU.

21:28:48 >> CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW?
>> Mayor Mei:   YES.
>> WELL,
21:28:51  THANK YOU.
MAYOR LILY MEI
21:28:55 , VICE MAYOR AND 
THE COUNCILMEMBERS.
21:28:58 
AS MAYOR STARTED THIS MEETING BY 
SAYING THAT OUR COUNTRY
21:29:01  WAS 
BASED ON THE PREMISE
21:29:05  OF LIFE, 
LIBERTY
21:29:08  AND PURSUIT OF 
HAPPINESS, EVERYBODY
21:29:11  AGREES WITH 
THAT.
BUT EVERYBODY'S
21:29:14  LIBERTY, THE 
ACCESS,
21:29:18  THE PART TO EVERYBODY'S 
LIBERTY HAS NO
21:29:21  WAY, SHOULD GO
21:29:24  
THROUGH THE RUINS OF THE BURNED 
HOUSES
21:29:29  OF THE RESIDENTS WHO LIVE 
NEAR THE MISSION
21:29:32  PEAK.
21:29:36 
THEIR HAPPINESS CANNOT BE
21:29:39  USED 
FOR MY CONSTANTLY FEAR
21:29:43  CONSTANT FEAR OF
21:29:46  BEING 
BURGLARIZED, I HAVE BEEN
21:29:50  
BURGLARIZED
21:29:53  BY THE WAY OF THE 
PEOPLE WHO ARE SCOPING OUT
21:29:56  THE 
HOUSES OVER THE FENCE.
I'VE ALREADY SENT THE POLICE,
21:29:59  
I'VE ALREADY SENT THE CITY 
COUNCIL THE PHOTOGRAPHS OF
21:30:03  
THOSE.
NOW THERE HAS TO BE A BALANCE
21:30:06 .
WE ARE ALL SAYING BALANCE.
THE
21:30:11  FIRE DAYS, THE FIRE DANGER 
IS REAL, IT IS NOT
21:30:14  IMAGINARY, 
ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS
21:30:17  
NOBODY ELSE HAS SPOKEN ABOUT 
RIGHT NOW
21:30:21 , IT'S REDUCTION
21:30:24  OF THE 
AMOUNT
21:30:27  OF WEED THAT CAN BURN 
DURING THE FIRE.
21:30:31 
THE COW GRAZING IS EMPLOYED TO 
REDUCE
21:30:34  THE FUEL LOAD.
IN COMMON MAN
21:30:37 'S TERM LIKE 
MYSELF, IT'S CALLED WEED
21:30:40  
ABATEMENT.
WE NEED MORE EFFICIENT METHODS
21:30:44  
LIKE GOAT GRAZING, ON
21:30:49  AND OR 
MECHANICAL MEANS.
21:30:53 
MOST IMPORTANTLY IT HAS TO START 
BY THE START OF THE
21:30:56  FIRE SEASON.
THIS PAST
21:31:00  YEAR IT CONTINUED IN 
JUNE SOMETIMES, SECOND
21:31:03  OR THIRD 
WEEK, AND CONTINUED
21:31:07  THROUGH 
AUGUST, SEPTEMBER.
IT'S
21:31:10  NOT ACCEPTABLE.
I WILL READ FOR
21:31:14  YOU WHEN I 
CONTACTED
21:31:18  THE PARK DISTRICT THE 
PERSON IN CHARGE EVER THIS 
GRAZING SAID
21:31:21 , I'M QUOTING, THAT 
I'M IN CHARGE OF THE GRAZE
21:31:24 ING 
ACTIVITY, NOT FOR THE GOAT 
21:31:27  
GRAZING OR THE MECHANICAL, 
THAT'S UNDER MY
21:31:30  PARK DISTRICT'S 
FIRE DEPARTMENT.
GO TO
21:31:34  THEM OR GO TO YOUR CITY
21:31:37  
AUTHORITIES.
THEIR FIRE PEOPLE OR THEIR 

21:31:40 POLICE.
WHAT, AM I
21:31:43  A FREMONT CITIZEN A 
FOOTBALL TO BE
21:31:47  KICKED AROUND 
WHEN MY HOUSE IS GETTING BURNED?
IT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE
21:31:50 .
REJECT THE LEASE.
THANK YOU
21:31:53 .
>> Mayor Mei:   NEXT SPEAKER IS 
THE SPEAKER
21:31:56  ENDING IN THE NUMBER 
555.

21:32:02 PLEASE UNMUTE YOURSELF CALLER, 
ENDING WITH
21:32:05  THREE DIGITS, 555.

21:32:19 CAN YOU HEAR ME?
THE SPEAKER THAT'S NEXT IS THE
21:32:22  
ONE WITH THE PHONE NUMBER ENDING 
IN THE THREE DIGITS
21:32:26 , 555.

21:32:32 >> ALL RIGHT I GOT YOU.
HELLO
21:32:35 ?
>> Mayor Mei:   YES, GO AHEAD.
>> I'M
21:32:39  JAMES KELLER
21:32:42 , I'M A 
RESIDENT OF SUNNYVALE, A
21:32:46  LITTLE 
SURPRISED THAT FREMONT IS 
TALKING ABOUT RESTRICTING
21:32:49  ACCESS 
TO PUBLIC PARKS WHEN
21:32:53  MOST 
INCREASE ACCESS TO PARKS BUT I 
MEAN YOU
21:32:56  GUYS DO YOU.
MY COMMENT WAS
21:33:00  PRIMARILY WHAT WE 
HAVE A PANDEMIC, EVERYBODY'S 
EXCITED
21:33:03  ABOUT BUT WE ALSO HAVE 
AN EPIDEMIC
21:33:06  OF OBESITY IN THIS 
COUNTRY AND THE PRIMARY CAUSE OF
21:33:10  
THAT THESE DAYS SEEM TO BE 
ACCEPTED AS LACK
21:33:13  OF EXERCISE AND 
POOR EATING HABITS.
AND
21:33:16  ONCE SOMEBODY STARTS DOWN
21:33:19  
THE OBESITY TREND LINE IT'S VERY 
DIFFICULT
21:33:23  TO REVERSE.
SO IT'S IMPORTANT THAT PEOPLE
21:33:26  
HAVE AS MUCH ACCESS TO EXERCISE 
AS POSSIBLE
21:33:29  TO LIMIT THIS AND 
THAT'S WHERE PARKS COME IN, IT'S 
A
21:33:33  GREAT PLACE TO GET EXERCISE.
21:33:36 
THE PART OF THE PARK THAT 
FREMONT OWNS AND LEASE
21:33:39 S HAPPENS 
TO HAVE ONE OF THE BEST TRAILS 
IN THE BAY AREA FOR HIKING
21:33:42 .
IT'S VERY SAFE.
IT'S EASY TO FOLLOW AND 

21:33:46 DIFFICULT TO GET LOST.
21:33:49 
THE VIEWS ARE VERY REWARDING.
THERE ARE A NUMBER
21:33:52  OF BENCHES ON 
THE HIDDEN VALLEY TRAIL GOING 
FROM
21:33:56  STANFORD AFTERNOON AND EVEN 
GETTING TO THE
21:33:59  FIRST BENCH WHICH 
ISN'T THAT FAR AND ISN'T VERY 
STEEP
21:34:02  GETTING THERE GIVES PRETTY 
GOOD VIEWS OF THE BAY AND
21:34:05  THE 
CITIES AROUND THE BAY AREA.
AND OF COURSE THE HIGHER YOU GO 

21:34:08 THE BETTER THE VIEWS GET.
SO THIS IS A GREAT ENCOURAGE
21:34:11 MENT 
FOR ANYBODY WHO WANTS TO GET 
EXERCISE.

21:34:14 THEY GO OUT THEY GET A GOOD 
REWARD OF THE VIEW
21:34:17  AND IT 
ENCOURAGES THEM TO COME AND HIKE 
SOME MORE.

21:34:20 THAT'S ABOUT ALL I HAVE TO SAY.
THANK YOU
21:34:24 .
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.
NEXT SPEAKER IS
21:34:28  WILLIAM ARUGI.
WELCOME,
21:34:31  WILLIAM
21:34:34 .
>> THANK YOU.
WILLIAM ARUG
21:34:37 I, MISSION PEAK 
CONSERVATORS
21:34:42  
21:34:48  
CONSERVANCY.
OUR MISSION IN FORMING THE 

21:34:52 ORGANIZATION IS TO SPEAK OUT ON 
BEHALF OF VICHTDORS TO
21:34:55  OUR 
REGIONAL PARKS AND ADVOCATE FOR 
MULTIUSE TRAILS.

21:34:58 THOSE ARE THE TWO MAIN POINTS WE 
HAVE
21:35:01  WORKED DILIGENTLY FOR THE 
LAST SEN YEARS.
WHEN THE
21:35:04  COMMUNITY SERVICES 
DEPARTMENT SAYS THAT THEY'VE 
TALKED TO THE COMMUNITY, WHEN 

21:35:07 THEY SAY THAT, WHAT THEY'RE 
TALKING ABOUT IS THEY'RE TALKING 
ABOUT A
21:35:11  COMMUNITY OF A VERY 
SMALL SUB
21:35:14  SUBSETTLE OF FREMONT 
SPECIFICALLY THE MISSION HILLS 
NEIGHBORHOOD
21:35:17 .
THEY DON'T SPEAK TO THE REST OF 
THE COMMUNITY IN TERMS OF THE
21:35:19  
OTHER CITIZENS OF THE CITY.
AND WHEN COUNCILMEMBERS SPEAK 

21:35:22 ABOUT ALL THE NASTY THINGS THAT 
ARE GOING ON AT MISSION
21:35:26  PEAK 
THEY ARE FORGETTING THAT THEY 
REPRESENT ALL CITIZENS OF 

21:35:29 FREMONT.
SO THE RESPONSIBILITY THAT YOU 
HAVE IS TO ACTUALLY THINK ABOUT
21:35:32  
THE IMPACT OF YOUR DECISIONS ON 
EVERYBODY IN FREMONT
21:35:36 .
I REALLY HAVE A PROBLEM
21:35:39  WITH 
STATEMENTS BEING MADE BY PEOPLE
21:35:43  
THAT ARE PARTICIPATING IN THIS 
FORUM, MAKING STATEMENTS LIKE
21:35:46  
THE RESIDENTS WHO LIVE 
SURROUNDING THE MISSION PEAK
21:35:49  
PARK ROUTINELY ENCOUNTER
21:35:52  
POTENTIAL MISCREANTS,
21:35:55  SCOPING 
OUT TARGETS FOR
21:35:59  FUTURE BURGLARY.
I'M SORRY.
IT'S INAPPROPRIATE
21:36:03  TO CATEGORIZE 
PARK VISITORS AS ROB
21:36:06 BERS AND 
CRIMINALS AND MISCREANT
21:36:09 S AND 
CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR ET CETERA.
THESE ARE OUR CHILDREN
21:36:13 .
MOST OF THE PEOPLE WHO USE THE 
PARK ARE UNDER
21:36:16  30 YEARS OLD.
WE SHOULD RESPECT THE FACT THAT 
THEY WANT TO
21:36:19  GET OUT IN NATURE 
THEY WANT TO BE HEALTH AND THEY 
WANT
21:36:22  TO BE PHYSICALLY ACTIVE.
I'D
21:36:25  MUCH RATHER HAVE MY CHILDREN 
OUT HIKING THEAN
21:36:29  HIKING THAN SITTING IN FRONT
21:36:31  
OF A TELEVISION.
I'M SOMEWHAT APPALLED BY THE 

21:36:35 BEHAVIOR OF COUNCILMEMBERS WHO 
DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY ALL OF THE 
BOARD MEMBERS
21:36:38  AT EAST BAY VOTED 
TO SUPPORT THE LEASE, AND WHY
21:36:41  
THEY CALLED THE ACTIONS OF THE 
CITY COUNCIL AND
21:36:44  THE POLICE 
CHIEF SHAMEFUL AND UNLAWFUL.
21:36:48 
IT IS CLEAR TO ME THAT IF YOU 
PUSH PEOPLE TOWARDS THE
21:36:51  NARROW 
ENTRANCE AND FORCE THEM DOWN A 
CATTLE
21:36:55  CHUTE THAT IT IS UNSAFE.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THE
21:36:58  CITY 
COUNCIL OR THE CITY POLICE CHIEF 
COULD
21:37:01  EXPECT ANY OTHER RESULT 
OTHER THAN PUSHING PEOPLE DOWN A 
NARROW
21:37:05  CHUTE IS GOING TO 
INCREASE THE TRANSMISSION OF 
DISEASE
21:37:08  THAT'S BASED ON 
RESPIRATION
21:37:11 .
SO THE BOTTOM LINE IS, THE LEASE 
IS
21:37:14  ACTUALLY A GOOD THING FOR 
CITIZENS OF FREMONT.
AND WE
21:37:17  WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO 
SUPPORT IT.
THANK YOU.

21:37:23 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.
NEXT SPEAKER IS
21:37:26  R ROBBY
21:37:30  K.

21:37:33 >> THANK YOU, MAYOR MEI FOR 
INVITING ME OVER HERE
21:37:36 .
I'M A 25 YEAR RESIDENT OF 
FREMONT.

21:37:39 AND 16 YEAR RESIDENT
21:37:42  OF THE
21:37:48  
NEIGHBORHOOD WHICH IS RIGHT NEXT
21:37:51  
TO THE PARK.
AFTER HAVING LOOK AT THIS LEASE 

21:37:54 VERY CAREFULLY AND AFTER HEARING 
THE CONCERNS
21:37:58  OF COUNCILMEMBER 
KASSAN, COUNCILMEMBER SHAO
21:38:02  AND 
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN, I'M 
REALLY, REALLY
21:38:06  CONCERNED ABOUT 
HOW THIS LEASE IS DRAFTED.
THIS TO ME
21:38:10  DOESN'T SOUND LIKE A 
PARTNERSHIP OF EQUALS, THE WAY
21:38:13  
THIS LEASE IS DRAFTED.
YOU KNOW AND COUNCILMEMBER 

21:38:16 KASSAN SAYS YOU KNOW, WHO HAS 
THE ABILITY TO MAKE
21:38:19  DECISIONS 
WHEN THERE IS AN
21:38:22  EMERGENCY, A 
MEDICAL EMERGENCY, A
21:38:26  FIRE 
EMERGENCY OR ANY SITUATION THAT 
APPEARS.

21:38:29 THAT SHOULD BE MADE CLEAR WHO 
OWNS IT.
WHOSE
21:38:32  DECISION WILL IT BE?
AND COUNCILMEMBER SHAO
21:38:35  SESSION, 
YOU KNOW, EAST BAY
21:38:38  REGIONAL PARK 
DISTRICT HAS THE FUNDS AND THEY 
CAN WALK AWAY
21:38:41  FROM THIS
21:38:44  LEASE IN 
30 DAYS, NO LIABILITIES.
THAT IS A BIG
21:38:47  CONCERN.
YOU KNOW, THE POLICE CHIEF
21:38:50  AND 
THE FIRE CHIEF PRESENTED SOME 
DATA,
21:38:53  BUT I THINK THAT DATA IS A 
SINGLE COHORT.
21:38:56 
IT IS NOT A FULL PICTURE.
BECAUSE A LOT OF THE
21:38:59  MEMBERS, A 
LOT OF RESIDENTS THAT YOU HEARD 
FROM I'M NOT GOING
21:39:03  TO REPEAT 
THIS ON HOW THINGS HAVE DEGRADED
21:39:06 
DEGRADED, HOW THE PARKING, THE 
TRAFFIC, THE CLEANLINESS
21:39:09 , THE 
CRIME SITUATION HAS DEGRADED.
AND
21:39:12  I SAY IT'S A SINGLE DATE 
COHORT BECAUSE THE DATA
21:39:15  THAT 
GOES THROUGH EAST BAY REGIONAL 
PARK DISTRICT
21:39:18  IS NOT BUNDLED 
INTO THIS DATA.
I HAVE
21:39:21  CALLED EAST BAY PARK
21:39:24  
DISTRICT MULTIPLE TIMES IN 
VIOLATION
21:39:28  OF THE HOURS AND 
NOTHING EVER HAPPENS.
IN THE ENDS
21:39:31  I WOULD SAY WHY A 25 
YEAR LEASE?
21:39:34 
WHY NOT A SHORTER LEASE WITH THE 
ABILITY OF PUBLIC FEEDBACK
21:39:37  AND 
THE ACCOUNTABILITY ON THE PART 
OF
21:39:40  EAST BAY REGIONAL PARK 
DISTRICT.
I THINK THE WAY THE LEASE
21:39:43  IS 
WRITTEN SHOULD BE REJECTED, 
THANK YOU.

21:39:48 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.
THE NEXT SPEAKER IS GARY.

21:39:55 >> THANK YOU, MAYOR MEI AND CITY 
COUNCIL MEMBERS.

21:39:58 CAN YOU HEAR ME?
ARE YOU ABLE TO
21:40:01  HEAR ME?
HELLO?
>> Mayor Mei:   YES.
21:40:04 
>> OKAY.
THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING US THIS 

21:40:08 OPPORTUNITY TO COMMENT ON THIS 
VERY IMPORTANT ITEM.
I'M
21:40:11  ONE OF THE BOARD MEMBERS OF 
THE VINEYARD HEIGHTS 
REPRESENTING
21:40:14  ABOUT 132 
HOMEOWNERS.
I'VE BEEN INVOLVED
21:40:17  IN THIS
21:40:20  ISSUE 
SINCE 2012.
WHEN
21:40:23  THE EIR WAS DRAFTED AND 
THEN IT WAS REDONE
21:40:27  AND THINGS 
LIKE THAT.
I'M A GEOTECHNICAL ENGINEER
21:40:30 .
I'M VERY INTIMATELY INVOLVED 
WITH THE STUDIES THAT
21:40:33  THEY HAVE 
DONE.
I'M GOING TO COMMENT ON ONLY TWO 

21:40:36 ITEMS, ITEM NUMBER 5 IN THE 
LEASE, IT TALKS ABOUT
21:40:39  THE 
IMPROVEMENT.
I THINK I HEARD
21:40:43  TODAY THAT THE 
PARK DISTRICT IS NOT GOING TO
21:40:46  
BUILD THE PARKING LOT.
BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE RESOURCE
21:40:49 
RESOURCES BACK IN OCTOBER I SAW
21:40:52  
SOMEWHERE SOME CLIP THERE, ONE 
OF THE
21:40:57  DIRECTORS ASSOCIATED WITH 
THE PARK DISTRICT SAID, LET'S GO
21:41:00  
AND BUILD A PARKING LOT.
TWO WEEKS LATER THEY CHANGE
21:41:03  
THEIR MIND.
THE REASON THEY CHANGE THEIR 

21:41:06 MIND IS THEY HAVE THE LEASE COME 
UP, THE
21:41:09  REVIEW COMING UP.
THEY WILL DO ANYTHING, AT THIS 
POINT I
21:41:12  DON'T TRUST THEM.
THEY WILL DO ANYTHING TO GET 
THIS LEASE
21:41:15  SIGNED.
AND THEN YOU WILL SEE WHAT 
HAPPENS.

21:41:18 IT IS NAIVE TO ASSUME THAT THE 
DISTRICT ONLY
21:41:21  PLANS TO IMPROVE 
MAINTENANCE, REPAIRS, UP
21:41:24 GRADES 
TO EXISTING ASSETS.
IF THE CITY STAFF IS SO
21:41:28  
CONFIDENT WHY NOT SPECIFICALLY 
PROHIBIT ANY DETENTION
21:41:32 , 
DETENTION POND CONSTRUCTION, 
PERIOD, END OF
21:41:35  STORY, GET IT IN 
WRITING.
FIVE YEARS, TEN YEARS DOWN
21:41:38  THE 
ROAD WE MAY NOT BE THERE.
CITY STAFF WILL
21:41:42  CHANGE, THE 
DISTRICT STAFF WILL CHANGE.
THEY WILL COME BACK
21:41:45  WITH MORE 
MONEY, THEY WILL FIND MORE 
MONEY, WHAT IS GOING
21:41:48  TO HAPPEN 
THEN?
THE CITY'S APPROVAL AUTHORITY IS
21:41:51  
TO VAGUE AND WEAK.
SO I REALLY SINCERELY
21:41:54  HOPE THAT 
THAT GOES INTO THE LEASE, THE 
REVISE
21:41:57 ED LEASE AGREEMENT.
FINALLY INDEMNITY
21:42:02  AND HOLDING 
THE CITY HARMLESS,
21:42:05  THIS IS A 
1978 INDEMNITY
21:42:09  CLAUSE IT WILL 
THE INDEMNIFICATION
21:42:13  HAVE CHANGED 
A LOT.
IT'S BECOME VERY COMPLEX.
21:42:16 
EVERYBODY SUES EVERYBODY, THEY 
WILL FIND
21:42:20  LOOPHOLES, A EXAMPLE, 
PEOPLE ARE WALKING
21:42:23  AWAY FROM 
LIABILITY, INSURANCE LIMITS, I 
THINK CITY
21:42:27  NEEDS BETTER 
PROTECTION, BETTER LANGUAGE THAN 
A SMALL
21:42:30  PARAGRAPH ABOUT 
INDEMNIFICATION.
WE NEED TO
21:42:34  PROTECT THE CITY SO 
WE AS A CITY ARE PROTECTED.
21:42:37 
WHO BELIEVES THAT THE CITY WILL 
EVER INVOKE THE TERMINATION
21:42:41  
CLAUSE?
NEVER HAPPEN, NOT EVEN CITED
21:42:44 , 
NEVER EVEN CITED
21:42:48  THE PARK 
DISTRICT FOR ANY VIOLATION.
WHAT IS
21:42:51  THE COMMUNITY GOING TO 
DO?
NOTHING COMING OUT
21:42:54  OF IT BECAUSE 
IT IS BUSINESS AS USUAL.
THERE IS NOTHING WRITTEN
21:42:57  IN 
THERE BECAUSE IF THE
21:43:00  CITY SAYS 
NO THEY WILL NOT DO IT.
ALL OF THESE
21:43:02  PROCESSES DON'T 
WORK.
THANK YOU.

21:43:11 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.
NEXT SPEAKER IS THE PHONE NUMBER 
ENDING
21:43:15  IN 167.
PLEASE UNMUTE YOURSELF.

21:43:28 PHONE NUMBER ENDING IN 167.
THANK YOU
21:43:31  YOU ARE UNMUTED.
21:43:35 
>> THIS IS AJAY, I FULLY AGREE 
WITH
21:43:38  A LOT OF THE PASSION THAT'S 
BEING BROUGHT OUT TODAY 
INCLUDING
21:43:42  THE PERSON WHO JUST 
SPOKE.
I PERSONALLY THINK
21:43:45  THIS WHOLE 
CONCEPT OF THE LEASE AGREEMENT 
NEEDS TO
21:43:48  GO BACK TO SCRATCH.
AND
21:43:51  TAKE OUR INPUTS AND REBUILD 
IT.
BECAUSE
21:43:54  IT IS JUST SO OPEN-END
21:43:57 
OPEN-ENDED, VAGUE THAT ANYTHING 
CAN HAPPEN
21:44:01  ONCE THE LEASE IS 
SIGNED.
ANYONE CAN DO ANYTHING
21:44:04 .
AND THE OTHER THING IS, I WOULD 
GO AS FAR AS
21:44:08  SAYING THE PARKING 
ON BOTH SIDES
21:44:12  OF THE ANTELOPE, 
OVER THE WEEKEND, IS A JOKE
21:44:15 .
I SEE PEOPLE COMING BACK FROM 
THEIR
21:44:18  HIKES, OBVIOUSLY THEY MAY 
BE TIRED, CHANGING ON BOTH
21:44:21  SIDES 
OF THEIR VEHICLES WHICH MEANS 
THEY'RE ALSO ON
21:44:25  THE ROAD.
AND THEN YOU HAVE TO GET ON
21:44:28  
ANTELOPE, YOU HAVE TO KIND OF 
DRIVE IN THE MIDDLE
21:44:31  OF THE ROAD.
I MEAN THIS IS AN -- IT IS
21:44:35  AN 
ABSOLUTE JOKE.
THAT WHOLE PARKING SHOULD BE 

21:44:38 ELIMINATED.
THAT'S WHAT FORCED THESE PEOPLE 
TO GO TO OHLONE
21:44:42 .
AND ONE OF THESE DAYS SOMEONE'S 
GOING TO GET
21:44:45  HURT.
AND I WILL PERSONALLY BLAME THE 
CITY FOR
21:44:48  IT.
FOR NOT HAVING DONE THE RIGHT 
THING.

21:44:51 I HOPE ALL OF YOU
21:44:57  TAKE A 
MORTGAGE
21:45:00  MORNING 
DRIVE ON ANTELOPE
21:45:03  ON THE 
WEEKEND.
THANK YOU.

21:45:06 >> Mayor Mei:   NEXT SPEAKER 
PLEASE IS FADMA
21:45:12  PADMA.
>> THANK YOU.
I HAVE A FEW POINTS TO
21:45:15  MAKE.
A GENERATION IS DEFINED AS 30 
YEARS
21:45:19 .
SO 25 YEARS IS ALMOST A 
GENERATION
21:45:23 .
WE DON'T WANT TO SIENL ANY LEASE 
FOR A
21:45:26  SIGN ANY LEASE 
FOR A GENERATION
21:45:29 .
THREE TO FIVE YEARS, EVEN 
COUNTRIES HAVE DEVELOPMENT PLANS
21:45:32  
FOR FIVE YEARS.
SO THREE TO FIVE YEARS I THINK 

21:45:35 IS A VERY ACCEPTABLE ONE AND 
THEN CAN BE RENEWED
21:45:38 .
THE SECOND POINT I WANT TO MAKE 
IS,
21:45:42  SO MANY PARKS HAVE
21:45:46  OPEN 
HOURS FROM 5 A.M. TO 10 P.M. BUT
21:45:49  
DIFFERENT PARKS ARE DIFFERENT.
SO ECAT
21:45:56  WE CAN'T CATEGORIZE AS THE 
SAME.
THIS IS A
21:45:59  VERY MOUNTAINOUS AREA, 
WILD AREA
21:46:03 , HOMES ARE CLOSE BY.
WHY CAN'T WE FOLLOW PARKS THAT
21:46:06  
DO CLOSE AS SUNSET, THAT IS NOT
21:46:09  
UNREASONABLE.
FROM SUNRISE TO SUNSET, SO 

21:46:13 PEOPLE CAN ENJOY THE VIEW AND 
ACTUALLY BE SAFE ON THE TRAILS.
SO
21:46:16  I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE THOSE 
REASONABLE HOURS.
THE THIRD THING
21:46:19  IS SOMEONE MADE 
THE COMMENT OF THE PARK WAS
21:46:22  
THERE FIRST AND THE HOUSES CAME 
LATER.

21:46:25 HOW DOES THAT ARGUMENT MATTER?
BECAUSE IT WAS
21:46:28  NOT DONE 
ILLEGALLY, IT WENT THROUGH DUE 
PROCESS.
21:46:31 
WITH PERMITS.
AND THEN THE HOUSES WERE BUILT.
21:46:34 
SO WHICH CAME FIRST, DOESN'T 
APPLY TO THIS.
21:46:38 
SO SINCE THE PEOPLE ARE HERE WE 
NEED TO GIVE DUE
21:46:41  CONSIDERATION.
AND THAT'S ALL THAT'S BEING 
ASKED FOR.
21:46:44 
THE OTHER THING ACCOUNT CROWDS.
ESPECIALLY
21:46:47  ON ANTELOPE.
CARS ON BOTH SIDES SOMETIMES 
WITH THE
21:46:50  DOORS OPEN.
WE DO HAVE TO BE SO CAREFUL THAT 
ACCIDENTS
21:46:54  COULD HAPPEN.
SO WE DO NOT WANT
21:46:58  TO INJURY 
ANYBODY'S HEALTH, ANY
21:47:00  VEHICULAR 
ACCIDENTS.
SO THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE.

21:47:03 AND IF WE WANT TO MAKE OHLONE SO 
ATTRACTIVE
21:47:07 , THEN WE NEED TO HAVE 
PEOPLE PAY FOR THE
21:47:10  PARKING 
PRIVILEGE ON THE STANFORD
21:47:14  
ENTRANCE.
OR BETTER YET, MAKE IT
21:47:17  NOT 
POSSIBLE OR ACCEPT THE
21:47:20  43 LOTS 
AT THE STANFORD LANDING AREA SO 
THOSE
21:47:23  ARE MY POINTS AND THANK 
YOU.
21:47:28 
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.
NEXT SPEAKER
21:47:33  IS SATICH
21:47:36 IT ORA 
THANK YOU.
YOU'RE UNMUTED.
21:47:39 
>> THANK YOU.
I'M HERE TO REJECT THE PROPOSED 

21:47:42 NEW LEASE FOR THE PARK FOR 
STANFORD STAGING PARK AND
21:47:46  WE ARE 
A GROUP OF MANY NEIGHBORHOODS 
WHO ARE ALREADY DISAPPOINTED
21:47:49  
THAT AFTER MORE THAN AYEAR OF 
TRYING TO NEGOTIATE A NEW
21:47:52  LEASE 
NOTHING HAS CHANGED.
IT IS THE SAME STATUS QUO.

21:47:55 THE PARK IS A CITY OWNED 
PROPERTY.
AND IT'S LEASE
21:47:58 ED TO THE PARK FOR 
FREE.
21:48:01 
BASED ON THE COMMENTS FROM THE 
BOARD MEETING, THE
21:48:05  PARK DISTRICT 
BOARD MEETING ON NOVEMBER
21:48:08  2nd 
THEY MENTIONED THAT THEY DO NOT 
WANT THE CITY
21:48:11  INTERFERING WITH 
THEIR PARK AND INSERTED LANGUAGE 
IN THE LEASE TO
21:48:14  ALLOW THEM TO 
FILE
21:48:17  AN INJUNCTION AGAINST THE 
CITY IF THEY EVER DO.
21:48:20 
AND THE LEASE HAS THE LANGUAGE 
STATED IN IT THAT
21:48:24  ALLOWS THE 
PARK TO SUE THE CITY, IF THE 
CITY
21:48:27  EVER STEPS IN TO STAY 
ACTION ON ISSUES RELATING
21:48:30  TO THE 
CITY'S OWN PROPERTY.
21:48:33 
THIS IS -- THIS PARK IS ONE OF 
THE MOST
21:48:37  VISITED REGIONAL PARKS 
WITH FREE
21:48:40  PARKING AND WITH MORE 
THAN QUARTER MILLION VISIT
21:48:42 ORS 
PER YEAR.
THE ISSUE IS WHATEVER HAS BEEN 

21:48:46 DONE TO PROMOTE OHLONE HAS 
CLEARLY NOT WORKED AND HAS NOT 
PRODUCED
21:48:49  ANY RESULTS.
TOO MUCH CONTROL HAS
21:48:52  BEEN GIVEN 
TO THE PARK DISTRICT.
WE NEEDS
21:48:55  SOME CHECKS AND 
BALANCES.
THE LEASE NEEDS TO MENTION
21:48:59  FIVE 
YEAR OPTION TO RENEW AND DO
21:49:02  A 
PERIODIC PERFORMANCE REVIEW
21:49:05 .
THE LEASE NEEDS TO MENTION 
STANFORD
21:49:08  PARKING FEES TO BE $1 
MORE THAN OHLONE PARKING
21:49:11  FEES 
AND STANFORD SHOULD CONTINUE 
STILL WITH THE PERMIT PARKING
21:49:15  
24-SEARCH.
21:49:18 SEVEN.
ALSO HAVE
21:49:21  TO CHANGE THE PARK 
HOURS FROM 8 A.M. TO
21:49:25  SUNSET, THE 
LEASE HAS TO MENTION THAT AND 
THE PARK
21:49:28  CANNOT CHANGE THEIR 
HOURS.
LEASE HAS TO MENTION CAP ON
21:49:31  
NUMBER OF VISITORS LIKE THE PARK
21:49:35  
IN PALO ALTO, LIKE LOCKING DATE,
21:49:39  
INSTALL CAMERAS, INSTALL QR CODE
21:49:42  
AND SCANNING SYSTEM TO LIMIT 
AFTER HOURS
21:49:45  VISTAORS FROM 
LOITERING AND PITCHING AND CAMP
21:49:48 
CAMPING TENTS LIKE THEY HAVE 
DONE RECENTLY.
21:49:52 
STANFORD SHOULD BE REMOVED IF 
ALL MAP APPS.
21:49:55 
MAKE STANFORD A BIKE ONLY 
ENTRANCE
21:49:59 .
DIVERT PARKING TO
21:50:02  OHLONE.
EVERYONE IN THE BAY AREA CANNOT
21:50:05  
VISIT THE SAME STANFORD STAGING
21:50:09  
PARK ENTRANCE, SHOULD HAPPEN BY 
THE BEGINNING OF THE FIRE 

21:50:12 SEASON.
THE LEASE NEEDS TO MENTION THAT.
WILL THE
21:50:15  DISTRICT PARK TAKE 
LIABILITY FOR FIRE DAMAGES CAUSE
21:50:18  
OF RECKLESSNESS CARELESSNESS
21:50:22  OF 
SOME HIKERS IN THE PARK, AND 
THEN
21:50:25  TAKE LIABILITY OF FREMONT 
RESIDENTS WITH
21:50:28  HIKERS CAUSE 
JAMMING THE ONLY TWO
21:50:31  ENTRANCE 
ROADS, ANTELOPE AND STANFORD.
21:50:34 
IS THE PARK GOING TO TAKE THE 
LIABILITY IF THERE IS CARE
21:50:37 
CARELESSNESS AND FIRE BECAUSE OF 
SOME HIKERS IN THE PARK?
21:50:41 
IN THE PARK THERE ARE TENTS 
BEING
21:50:44  PITCHED AND FIRES HEAT
21:50:46 ED 
FOOD --
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

21:50:49 NEXT SPEAKER IS KEVIN CHOW.

21:50:54 YOU'RE UNMUTED, THANK YOU
21:50:58 .
KEVIN.
>> HELLO, CAN YOU HEAR
21:51:01  ME?
HI, THANKS
21:51:04  FOR TAKING THE TIME 
TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE.
MY NAME
21:51:08  IS KEVIN CHOW AND I LIVE 
MERE
21:51:11  STANFORD ENTRANCE TO 
MISSION PEAK.
I HAVE BEEN LIVING IN THE 

21:51:14 MISSION AREA FOR OVER 20 YEARS 
AND I'M VERY GRATEFUL FOR
21:51:17  A 
WONDERFUL PARK HERE IN THE 
BACKYARD.

21:51:20 HOWEVER I'M VERY DISCOURAGED BY 
THE IDEA THAT
21:51:24  EAST BAY PARKS 
WOULD LIKE TO INCREASE CAR 
CAPACITY AT THE
21:51:27  STANFORD SITE.
A NEW PARKING STRUCTURE 
ACCOMMODATE
21:51:31 ING HUNDREDS OF NEW 
CARS BUILT ON AN UN
21:51:34 STABLE 
LANDSCAPE ON THE SIDE OF A STEEP 
HILL WHICH I
21:51:37  MAY ADD IS HIGHER 
IN ELEVATION
21:51:40  THAN NEARBY 
NEIGHBORS IS A VERY STRANGE 
DECISION.
21:51:44 
WE'VE HEARD OF LANDSLIDES 
THROUGHOUT THE HISTORY OF
21:51:47  
FREMONT, WE HAVE HEARD OF 
LANDSLIDES ON
21:51:50  THESE HILLS ON 
NEIGHBORHOODS THAT HAVE BEEN 
SUPPOSED
21:51:53 LY BUILT TO CODE.
WITH CLIMATE CHANGE AND
21:51:56  MORE 
EXTREME WEATHER I HAVE NO DOUBT
21:51:59  
WE WILL SEE MORE LANDSLIDES.
HOW
21:52:02  WILL EAST BAY PARKS
21:52:05  ASSURE 
US OF THE LIABILITY
21:52:10  AND THE 
ANSWER IS NO WAY.
MY LAST POINT IS
21:52:13  I DON'T BELIEVE 
ENCOURAGING MORE CARS TO COMMUTE 
IS IN LINE
21:52:16  WITH FREMONT'S VISION 
THAT I SEE ALL OVER THE CITY 
TODAY.
21:52:19 
WE'RE GETTING MORE AND MORE BIKE 
LANES, BETTER
21:52:22  PUBLIC TRAN KIT 
SIT, NEW
21:52:26  TRANSIT
21:52:29 , 
AND MORE STATIONS OPENING UP
21:52:32 .
HAVING MORE CAR CAPACITY IS IN 
DIRECT CONFLICT WITH
21:52:35  WHAT THE 
CITY OF FREMONT WANTS.
I'M ALL FOR ENCOURAGING MORE
21:52:38  
VISITORS BUT HAVING THE PARKING 
LOT IS NOT THE PATH
21:52:41  WE SHOULD 
TAKE.
IT IS REALLY DISHEARTENING THAT
21:52:45  
EAST BAY PARKS ARE EXPLORING 
OPTIONS THAT ARE A
21:52:48  LITTLE OUT OF 
TOUCH WHAT THE RESIDENTS WANT 
AND WHAT
21:52:51  THE CITY OF FREMONT IS 
PLANNING FOR OUR CITY.
I WANT TO ECHO MANY
21:52:54  OF THE 
CALLERS TODAY TO PUT IT IN 
WRITING THAT NO SUCH STRUCTURE
21:52:58  
WILL BE BUILT AND I IMAGINE A 
SHORTER TERM
21:53:01  LEASE WOULD CREATE 
BETTER ACCOUNTABILITY AND 
INCENTIVE FOR
21:53:04  THE PARKS TO WORK 
WITH US AND LISTEN TO THE 
RESIDENTS HERE, THANK YOU
21:53:09 .
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU, THE 
LAST SPEAKER IS R
21:53:12 AJUL HAPAK AND 
AFTER WHICH
21:53:16  I'M CLOSING THE OPEN 
PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD.
>> HI
21:53:19 , THIS IS RAJUL AND I AGREE 
WITH THE
21:53:22  FIRST SPEAKER AND THE 
MANY OTHER SPEAKERS
21:53:25  AFTER HER.
I CATEGORICALLY ASK
21:53:29  THE CITY 
COUNCIL TO REJECT THE MISSION 
PEAK
21:53:32  STANFORD ENTRANCE LEASE AS 
PRESENTED BY THE EAST BAY PARK
21:53:35  
DISTRICT.
I SPEAK ON BEHALF OF MY ENTIRE 

21:53:38 NEIGHBORHOOD.
THE CITY AND THE EAST BAY PARK 
DISTRICT BOTH
21:53:42  KEEP SAYING THAT 
HOABL SHOULD BE THE
21:53:45  
OHLONE SHOULD BE THE PRIMARY
21:53:48  
INTRANLS TO THE PARK.
THEY HAVE BEEN TRYING TO
21:53:51  MIGRATE 
VISITORS TO OHLONE BUT THIS HAS 
NOT
21:53:54  BEEN SUCCESSFUL.
YOU CAN PUT ALL YOU WANT ON THE 
SLIDES BUT
21:53:57  WE LIVE AND GROWTH 
THE CHAOS
21:54:04  BREATHE 
THE CHAOS EVERY DAY.
85%
21:54:07  OF VISITORS STILL FLOCK TO 
THE STANFORD
21:54:10  ENTRANCE.
THE PARKING IS TREE,
21:54:15  THE MAP 
APPS
21:54:19  SEND THE VISITORS
21:54:22  TO 
STANFORD ENTRANCE.
MAKING
21:54:25  STANFORD A BIKE 
PEDESTRIAN
21:54:28  ONLY ENTRANCE AND LET 
THE CARS GO TO OHLONE,
21:54:32  THIS 
WOULD FEFG
21:54:35  REMOVE FROM THE MAP 
AUTOPSIES.
CHARGE $6
21:54:38  PER CAR AT STANFORD IF 
YOU HAVE TO
21:54:41 .
NOT DOING ANYTHING SHOULD NOT BE 
THE OPTION FOR
21:54:45  CITY COUNCIL.
YOU HAVE HAD ALL THIS TIME TO 
WORK ON THE LEASE AND
21:54:48  YOU STILL 
HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO DO ANYTHING
21:54:51  
TO STRIKE A BALANCE BETWEEN WHAT 
THE
21:54:54  HIKERS WANT AND WHAT THE 
RESIDENTS WANT
21:54:57 .
EACH AND EVERY ITEM SHOULD BE 
PUT ON
21:55:01  THE LEASE, THE CITY 
COUNCIL SHOULD NOT GO ON THE
21:55:04  
PROMISES.
>> Mayor Mei:   I SEE
21:55:06  ONE MORE 
SPEAKER BUT THIS IS THE LAST 
SPEAKER.

21:55:09 I'M CLOSING THE PUBLIC COMMENT 
PERIOD AND I'D LIKE TO SEE
21:55:13 , I 
DON'T KNOW WHO IS ON CALLER 
NUMBER 244 AND THEN
21:55:16  I'M GOING TO 
MAKE MY PUBLIC COMMENTS WHICH I 
HAVEN'T MADE YET
21:55:20 .
AND CLARIFYING QUESTIONS.
244.

21:55:25 >> THANK YOU.
GOOD EVENING, MY NAME IS BYRON 
COOPER
21:55:28 , I LIVE IN THE VINEYARD 
HIMS AREA.
THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY
21:55:31  
TO COMMENT AND I APPRECIATE THE 
STAFF'S WORK ON THIS LEASE 

21:55:35 HOWEVER I URGE THE COUNCIL TO 
REJECT THE
21:55:38  MISSION PEAK LEASE 
BECAUSE THE EAST BAY REGIONAL
21:55:41  
PARK DISTRICT HAS BUILT ROADS
21:55:44  IN 
THIS AREA WHICH VIOLATE THIS 
LEASE ALREADY.
21:55:47 
THESE ARE GRADED DIRT AND GRAVEL 
ROADS.
21:55:50 
THESE ROADS CREATE LIABILITY FOR 
THE CITY BECAUSE THEY
21:55:54  ALTER THE 
NATURAL CONDITION OF THE 
PROPERTY.

21:55:57 MISSION PEAK IS NOT LIKE OTHER 
PARK.
IT IS
21:56:00  A PRESERVE THAT EXISTS ON 
TOP OF A DANGEROUS SLIDE
21:56:04  COMPLEX 
THAT EXTENDS INTO SEVERAL 
NEIGHBORHOODS.
21:56:07 
A RECENT 2020 UCLA
21:56:10  STUDY 
FORECASTS MORE
21:56:13  SPEAKER RIVERS 
MAKING SLIDING AND FLOODING ON
21:56:16  
MISSION PEAK MORE LIKELY.
THIS IS A CLEAR THREAT TO THE
21:56:19  
NEIGHBORHOODS BELOW.
THE CITY CANNOT AVOID
21:56:23  OWNER 
LIABILITY BY GRANTING EXCLUSIVE 
RIGHT
21:56:26  TO THE EAST BAY PARK 
DISTRICT
21:56:29 .
WILL BE JUDGED AS OWNER
21:56:32  OF THE 
LAND.
AGAIN THIS IS NOT LIKE OTHER 

21:56:35 PARKS THEREFORE I URGE THE CITY 
TO EVALUATE THOSE DIRT AND
21:56:38  
GRAVEL ROADS ON THE PROPERTY, TO 
EVALUATE WATER FLOWS AND
21:56:41  
HILLSIDES ABILITY IN LIGHT OF 
THOSE NEW ROADS.

21:56:44 CONSIDER THE RECENT UCLA CLIMATE
21:56:47  
STUDY ON FLOODING AND SLIDE 
RISK.

21:56:50 I SENT A LETTER YESTERDAY THAT 
POINTS TO WHERE THAT STUDY IS
21:56:54  
AND FINALLY TO REEVALUATE 
LIABILITY CONSIDERING
21:56:57  THESE 
CHANGED CIRCUMSTANCES.
THE FINANCIAL IMPACT OF THIS 

21:57:00 LEASE IS NOT ZERO.
THIS IS NOT FLEE.
21:57:03  FREE.
THE EAST BAY REGIONAL PARK
21:57:07  
DISTRICT CONDUCT ON THIS LAND 
COULD CAUSE SIGNIFICANT 

21:57:10 LIABILITY FOR SLIDES AND 
FLOODING IN NEIGHBORHOODS BELOW.
THEREFORE,
21:57:13  THE CITY MUST ACT 
REASONABLY WHEN DEALING WITH
21:57:15  
DANGEROUS CONDITIONS ON ITS 
PROPERTY.

21:57:18 SO I ASK THE CITY COUNCIL TO 
PLEASE REJECT THIS LEASE
21:57:22 , 
CONDUCT FURTHER EVALUATIONS AS I 
HAVE
21:57:25  OUTLINED.
AND TO PLEASE MAKE SURE THAT
21:57:28  
THERE ARE REASONABLE ENFORCEMENT 
PROVISIONS IN ANY NEW
21:57:31  LEASE.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
21:57:35 
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.
I'M CLOSING THE
21:57:38  PUBLIC COMMENT 
PERIOD RIGHT NOW AND I'LL TURN 
IT BACK TO THE COUNCIL WITH 

21:57:42 COMMENTS BUT I'M GOING TO START 
WITH SOME COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS
21:57:45  
OF MY OWN BOUGHT I DIDN'T GET TO 
ASK MY QUESTIONS EARLIER
21:57:47 .
COUPLE OF QUESTIONS TO THE 
STAFF.

21:57:50 RIGHT NOW THIS LAND IS BEING 
MAINTAIN
21:57:54 ED WHILE MAYBE DIFFERENT 
PERSPECTIVES ON THE QUALITY OF
21:57:57  
THE MAINTENANCE.
BUT I'LL ASK, I'LL DIRECT THIS
21:58:00  
TO DIRECTOR WOLF.
IF WE WERE
21:58:03  TO BRING THAT BACK 
FOR
21:58:07  THE ACRES THAT WE HAVE, IS 
THERE ANY FUNDING
21:58:10  THAT IS 
ALLOCATED TO THE MAINTENANCE OF 
THAT PIECE OF LAND
21:58:13  AS IT STANDS 
AND HOW MUCH WOULD IT BE A YEAR?
>> THERE IS
21:58:16  NO FUNDING.
THERE IS NO GENERAL FUND 
ALLOCATION FOR THIS SITE
21:58:20  FOR THE 
900 ACRES.
I DON'T KNOW THE
21:58:24  COST OFF THE 
TOP OF MY HEAD
21:58:27 , FOR THAT, WE 
HAVE NEVER DONE A
21:58:30  COST 
ALLOCATION.
I KNOW EAST BAY REGIONAL
21:58:34  PARKS 
SPENDS APPROXIMATELY $400,000 A
21:58:37  
YEAR FOR THE TOTAL NUMBER OF 
ACRES FOR MISSION PEAK.
21:58:39 
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.
I JUST WANTED TO COMMENT BECAUSE 

21:58:42 I WANTED TO MAKE A GENERAL 
COMMENT TOO.
HAVE WE
21:58:45  AND THIS IS FOR OUR 
LEGAL TEAM, HAVE WE
21:58:49  BEEN, IT 
SOUNDS LIKE WHAT I'M HEARING 
TONIGHT BUT
21:58:52  I'D BE CURIOUS TO 
FIND OUT.
21:58:55 
HAVE WE BEEN SUED BY EITHER THE 
EAST BAY
21:58:58  REGIONAL PARKS OR ANY 
OF THE RESIDENTS?
IT CALLS TO QUESTION WHEN I
21:59:01  
LISTEN TO A LOT OF THIS 
CONVERSATION ABOUT LAND USE AND
21:59:04  
AS WE MOVE FORWARD WITH 
CONSTRUCTION AND WHEN WE LOOK AT
21:59:08  
PLAN BAY AREA 2050, WE'RE 
LOOKING AT
21:59:12  THE FUTURE OF VINYL 
IMPACT, THAT'S FOR A
21:59:15  LOT OF 
THINGS, NOT JUST FOR THE
21:59:19  WILD 
FIRES, HAVE WE EVER
21:59:23  HAD A 
HISTORY OF BEING SUED FOR
21:59:26  FIRES 
ON ANY OF THOSE HILLSIDES?
>> NOT THAT I'M
21:59:30  AWARE OF.
>> Mayor Mei:   OKAY, I'M JUST 
CURIOUS BECAUSE THAT IS
21:59:33  ONE OF 
THE QUESTIONS I'VE HAD COMING TO 
US IS ON THE HILLSIDES
21:59:37 .
AND I MEAN SOMETHING THAT WE'LL 
HAVE TO CONSIDER AS
21:59:41  WE HAVE 
REQUIREMENTS SET BY THE STATE.
I WANTED TO MAKE
21:59:43  A POINT OF 
CLARIFICATION ALSO FOR EMERGENCY 
ORDINANCE.

21:59:47 I GUESS HAVE WE EVER HAD ANOTHER 
CASE THAT YOU'RE
21:59:50  AWARE OF, THIS 
IS FOR
21:59:53  OUR LEGAL COUNSEL THAT IN 
THIS EMERGENCY ORDINANCE LAST
21:59:56   
TIME WHERE THE GOVERNOR
22:00:00  I THINK 
IN THIS CASE GAVE AUTHORITY TO 
SUPERSEDE
22:00:03  THE CITY'S AND 
MUNICIPALITIES TO GOVERN IT
22:00:06  TO 
THE HEALTH AUTHORITIES?
22:00:13 
>> Ms. Margolis:   ARE YOU 
TALKING ABOUT WITH RESPECT TO 

22:00:17 THE PANDEMIC THE EMERGENCY 
ORDERS?
THE STATE HAS THE AUTHORITY
22:00:20  TO 
ISSUE EMERGENCY ORDERS IN THE 
SITUATION WHERE
22:00:24  THERE IS AN 
EMERGENCY AND THEY COULD 
SUPERSEDE
22:00:27  THE CITY'S AUTHORITY 
AT THAT POINT IN TIME.
>> Mayor Mei:  
22:00:30  THAT IS KIND OF 
UNPRECEDENTED, WE HAVEN'T DONE 
THAT IN THE
22:00:33  PAST.
WE WERE WELL WITHIN OUR 
AUTHORITY TO MAKE THAT
22:00:36  DECISION.
WE DID NOT CLOSE DOWN THE PARK.
WHAT
22:00:40  WE DECIDED TO DO IS CLOSE 
DOWN THE STREET.
22:00:43 
I WANTED TO CLARIFY THAT.
IT'S UNFORTUNATE WE
22:00:46  HAD TO CLOSE 
IT DOWN.
IF
22:00:49  PEOPLE HAVE TO DISPOSE OF 
HUMAN WASTE I WOULD
22:00:52  HAVE LIKED 
TO HAVE NOT SEEN TOILET PAPER 
HANG
22:00:55 ING OUT OF THE
22:00:59  GRATES.
22:01:03 
IT'S HUMAN CONDITION THAT WE 
NEED TO ADDRESS.
22:01:06 
ONE THING ABSOLUTELY I WOULD 
ABSOLUTELY AGREE THAT WE LOVE
22:01:10  
PEOPLE WITH OUR GREEN CLIMATE 
ACTION PLAN DRIVE
22:01:13  OR BIKE AND 
WALK TO OTHER MEDIUMS.
BUT I
22:01:16  WILL TELL YOU THAT 
IRONICALLY SINCE IT'S NOT JUST
22:01:19  
THE PARKS THAT WERE THERE, OUR 
SCHOOLS WERE THERE BEFORE SOME 

22:01:22 OF THIS TOO AND I CAN'T TELL YOU 
HOW OFTEN I'M AT THE
22:01:25  SCHOOL 
SITES AND I LOOK AT THE POOR 
BEHAVIOR OF PARENTS AND
22:01:28  OTHER 
PEOPLE WHO FEEL THAT IT'S THEIR 
PRIORITY TO GET
22:01:31  THEIR CHILDREN 
THERE.
AND THEY PARK EVERYWHERE.

22:01:34 THEY DON'T CARE WHERE THEY PARK.
THEY DON'T CARE WHO
22:01:37  THEY BLOCK.
THEY'RE JUST IT'S MY HURRY AND
22:01:41  
SO THAT IS THE THING I THINK 
THAT ONE OF THE THINGS RIGHT NOW 

22:01:44 I'M HOPING WE ADDRESS AND IT'S 
NOT JUST ADDRESSED BY THIS LEASE
22:01:47  
OR ANY OF THIS AGREEMENT IS 
CONDUCT AND HOW WE
22:01:50  BEHAVE IN THE 
COMMUNITIES.
I WOULD LOVE FOR PEOPLE TO BE 

22:01:54 MORE COURTEOUS AND TO BE 
RESPECTFUL AND TO
22:01:57  WALK THEIR 
KIDS OR TO BE ENVIRONMENTALLY 
FRIENDLY.
22:02:00 
ON ONE HAND WE ASK PEOPLE TO 
BEHAVE IN A
22:02:03  CERTAIN WAY AND IT 
IS HARD BECAUSE WE WANT PEOPLE 
TO UTILIZE THE
22:02:06  PARKS.
WE DEFINITELY HAVE IN OUR HEALTH
22:02:09  
STUDIES AWARENESS OF OBESITY AND 
OTHER CONCERNS FOR
22:02:13  HEALTH AND 
WELLNESS.
THAT IS WHY WE DID A
22:02:16  WALK WITH 
YOUR COUNCILMEMBERS THROUGHOUT 
OTHER PARTS OF THE DISTRIBUTE, 

22:02:19 WE ARE TRYING TO GET PEOPLE OUT 
OF THEIR CARS AND TO WALK.
22:02:22 
ONE OF THE CHALLENGES I HEARD IS 
ABOUT CHARGING
22:02:25  MORE FOR PARKING.
I AGREE THAT WOULD BE A 
WONDERFUL WAY
22:02:29  TO DO BUT I 
BELIEVE AND SUZANNE YOU
22:02:32  CAN 
CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG, THE
22:02:34  
LEASE FOR OHLONE IS A SEPARATE 
AGREEMENT.

22:02:37 I CAN SEE COUNCILMEMBER COX 
NODDING HER HEAD.
>> THAT IS CORRECT
22:02:41 .
>> Mayor Mei:   ONE OF IT 
PROBABLY IS COST OF CONSTRUCTION
22:02:43 
CONSTRUCTION.
AND WHEN IT COMES TO THINGS I 

22:02:46 AGREE ON THE GATES AND SOME OF 
THE IDEAS OF GATES OR OF PARK
22:02:49 ING 
BUT, ONE OF THE CHALLENGES AND I 
HOPE THAT THE
22:02:52  COMMUNITY DOES 
UNDERSTAND BECAUSE I'VE BEEN 
AROUND FOR LONG ENOUGH
22:02:55  FOR 27 
YEARS TOO AND TO VIEW SOME OF 
THIS USAGE
22:02:59  AND WHEN I WAS ON 
COUNCIL IN THE BEGINNING THERE 
WAS A DISCUSSION
22:03:02  ABOUT MOVING TO 
HAVING PERMIT PARKING.
HAVING
22:03:05  PERMIT
22:03:08  PARKING, HAVING 
STUFF COSTS MONEY
22:03:12 , WEED 
ABATEMENT COSTS MONEY.
IF
22:03:15  PEOPLE WANT TO HAVE SOME OF 
THESE PROGRAMS AND OTHER THINGS 
I KNOW THAT
22:03:19  WHEN WE'VE ASKED FOR 
PARCEL TAX AND OTHER THINGS OR
22:03:22  
PARK FEES, PEOPLE NEED TO STEP 
UP
22:03:25  AND PAY FOR THAT.
IT IS A PUBLIC PARK.
22:03:28 
EAST BAY REGIONAL PARK IS NOT 
ALL OWNED, IF YOU LOOK AT THE
22:03:31  
NAP, THAT IS NOT WHOLLY OWNED BY 
THE CITY
22:03:35 .
IT IS A COMMUNITY PARK AND I WAS 
NOT
22:03:38  HERE ON THE COUNCIL AT THE 
TIME WHEN WE DECIDED TO BUILD 
THAT
22:03:41  PIECE OF THE HOMES.
I DO RECALL
22:03:45  SOWING ALL THE HOMES 
COMING UP
22:03:48 , I GREW UP NEAR A 
WILDLIFE
22:03:51  PRESERVE, I LOVE TO SEE 
THE ANIMALS, THERE WERE NO
22:03:54  
PARKING OR WAYS TO GET THROUGH 
THERE AT THAT TIME.
22:03:57 
THIS IS A PARK WE WANT TO HAVE 
ACCESSIBLE TO THE COMMUNITY.

22:04:01 IT IS A BALANCE BETWEEN HOW WE 
PROVIDE THAT ACCESSIBILITY AND 
ALSO
22:04:04  OUR RESPONSIBILITY.
AND SO TO BE ABLE TO, I
22:04:07  DISAGREE 
ON SOME OF THE IDEAS ON 
CONSERVATION AND THE
22:04:10  ABILITY TO 
MAINTAIN IT.
I ALSO AGREE
22:04:13  THAT PART OF THIS 
RESPONSIBILITY
22:04:16  I KNOW THAT YOU 
CAN ANSWER ME
22:04:20 , DIRECTOR WOLF 
PROBABLY ON THIS AND ALSO 
DIRECTOR
22:04:23  ACANO, WHEN WE HAVE THE 
LIAISON
22:04:26  MEETINGS THEY ARE OPEN 
TO THE PUBLIC ARE THEY NOT?
>> YES,
22:04:29  THEY ARE.
>> Mayor Mei:   THEY ARE, OKAY.
SO I WOULD HOPE
22:04:32  THAT ONE OF THE 
THINGS IS THAT WHEN WE TALK 
ABOUT ACCOUNT
22:04:36 ABILITY, OR 
TRANSPARENCY OR MAKING
22:04:39  THE 
COMMUNITY'S VOICE HEARD, IT 
SHOULDN'T BE JUST
22:04:42  RELYING UPON 
THESE TYPES OF MEETINGS WHEN 
THESE COME UP
22:04:45  FOR DISCUSSION.
IF YOU WANT YOUR VOICE HEARD, 
RUN FOR
22:04:49  THE COMMISSIONS, BE  PART 
OF
22:04:52  THIS CONVERSATION ONGOING.
IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT WE WANT 
TO
22:04:55  LOOK AT EVERY 25 YEARS OR 
FIVE YEARS, IT
22:04:59  COMES UP EVERY 
TIME WHEN THERE'S ELECTION FOR 
THAT.
22:05:02 
IF YOU THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT 
YOU SHOULD GET INVOLVED IN
22:05:05  THOSE 
PROCESSES AND HOPEFULLY HAVE 
RECOMMENDATION FROM
22:05:08  YOUR 
COMMUNITIES.
I ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO GET 

22:05:11 INVOLVED NOT JUST IN THIS 
CONVERSATION.
I'M A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED WHEN
22:05:14  I 
HEAR ABOUT THE LITIGIOUS
22:05:18 NESS, 
THEY WANT TO SUE US IF WE CLOSE
22:05:21  
IT, OR OPEN IT, IT
22:05:24  SEEMS LIKE 
IT'S LITIGIOUS EITHER
22:05:27  WAY.
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE 
THESE CONVERSATIONS AND WHEN
22:05:31  IT 
COXTION TO THE CHANGES OF 
ORDINANCES OR LAND USE
22:05:34  OR THE 
IMPACT OF THE CLIMATE, THAT IS 
GOING
22:05:37  TO BE, THAT'S WHY WE HAVE 
CLIMATE ACTION PLAN IN 
DISCUSSIONS
22:05:40 , WHY WE HAVE OUR 
MOBILITY PLAN AND I
22:05:44  HOPE IT IS 
SOMETHING PEOPLE CONSIDER IN 
TERMS OF PROVIDING
22:05:47  
COMMUNICATIONS, WE ASK FOR 
SURVEYS
22:05:50  AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS TO 
PARTICIPATE.
I HOPE YOU
22:05:53  STEP UP AND GIVE US 
THOSE
22:05:57  SURVEYS AS WE UPDATE OUR 
PARK PLANS OR TRAIL PLANS
22:06:00 .
ONE OF THE THINGS I HEAR ABOUT 
PEOPLE
22:06:03  LOITERING OR PEOPLE 
WALKING.
I'LL SAY THAT IS TRUE
22:06:06  FOR ANY OF 
OUR LINEAR TRAILS, TRUE FOR ANY
22:06:10  
OF OUR SCHOOLS, ANY OF OUR PARKS 
THAT BACK TO
22:06:13  PEOPLE'S HOMES.
WE DO WARRANT
22:06:16  TO HAVE THESE 
AMENITIES, I WANT
22:06:19  PEOPLE TO BE 
ABLE TO WALK WITHIN TEN MINUTES
22:06:23  
FROM THEIR HOMES TO THEIR PARKS.
HOW DO WE
22:06:25  PROVIDE THAT AND HAVE 
RESPONSIBILITY WITHIN OUR 
COMMUNITY?

22:06:28 THERE ARE THINGS THAT WE CAN 
HOPEFULLY WORK ON TOGETHER AND 
IT REQUIRES PEOPLE
22:06:32  TO STEP UP.
IF YOU WANT NEIGHBORHOODS TO BE 
SAFER
22:06:35 , PARTICIPATE IN OUR VIDEO 
CAMERA PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR 
POLICE
22:06:38 .
PARTICIPATE IN YOUR
22:06:41  NEIGHBORHOOD 
TOWN CRIME WATCH ACTIVITIES.
22:06:45 
IT CAN'T BE JUST UPON ONE GROUP 
AND ALL THESE SOLUTION
22:06:48 S WILL 
COST MONEY.
AND SO IF YOU REALLY BELIEVE
22:06:51  IN 
THIS TYPE OF INVESTMENT, THEN WE 
NEED TO LOOK AT
22:06:54  HOW WE'RE GOING 
TO FUND SOME OF THESE.
AND SO I'M NOT
22:06:58  AGAINST ANY OF 
THESE IDEAS BUT THAT'S MY 
PERSONAL FEEDBACK.
22:07:01 
I WANT TO HEAR BACK FROM MY 
COUNCILMEMBERS ON SOME OF
22:07:04  THIS 
TOO BUT I JUST WANTED TO SHARE 
MY FEEDBACK
22:07:07  SINCE I DIDN'T GET A 
CHANCE TO EARLIER.
I'LL
22:07:10  BEGIN WITH COUNCILMEMBER 
SALWAN.
22:07:13 
>> Councilmember Salwan:   MADAM 
MAYOR IF IT'S OKAY I'LL GO AHEAD 

22:07:16 WITH COMMENTS.
>> Mayor Mei:   SURE.
>> Councilmember Salwan:   I 

22:07:19 THINK FROM A FAIRNESS 
PERSPECTIVE I
22:07:22  THINK MISSION SAN 
JOSE OR I SHOULD SAY MISS PEAK 
HAS
22:07:26  BEEN A RAGING SUCCESS.
AND I THINK IF
22:07:29  ANYONE HAD A PARK 
THAT EXPLODED IN SUCH A 
SURFACING
22:07:32 , AND IT WAS NEAR THEIR 
NEIGHBORHOOD THEY WOULD BE 
DEEPLY CONCERNED
22:07:35 .
SO I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD VIEW 
THIS AS JUST A
22:07:38  MISSION PEAK 
ISSUE BUT I THINK IF THIS 
AFFECTED ANY NEIGHBORHOOD
22:07:42  IN 
FREMONT I THINK WE WOULD HAVE A 
SIMILAR REACTION.

22:07:45 SO THE PARK IS A TENANT.
THEY DO
22:07:48  CREATE IMPACTS AND WE DO 
HAVE TO LOOK
22:07:51  AT THOSE IMPACTS.
I WANT TO COMMEND
22:07:54  SUZANNE AND 
HER TEAM FOR TRYING TO DO 
WHATEVER AND
22:07:58  TO TRY TO MITIGATE 
A LOT OF THOSE.
I THINK WE HAVE
22:08:01  COME FORWARD AND 
DONE A LOT OF THINGS ALREADY.
BUT I
22:08:04  THINK THERE IS KIND OF A 
LITTLE DISTRUST MAYBE
22:08:07  ON BOTH 
SIDES, THAT NEEDS TO GET WORKED 
OUT
22:08:11 .
SOME OF THESE THINGS THAT WE ARE 
DISCUSSING
22:08:15  ARE MORE WE'RE NOT 
GOING TO DO
22:08:18  THIS OR SIGN THE 
LEASE.
I THINK WE NEAT TO
22:08:21  GET MORE 
22:08:25  
EXPLICIT ON THE DIRECTION WE ARE 
GOING, SO WE DON'T
22:08:29  HAVE THESE 
ISSUES IN THE FUTURE TO PREVENT 
THESE LONG MEETINGS AND
22:08:32  HAVE 
MORE DIALOGUE.
I THINK IF THE PARK DISTRICT IS 

22:08:36 SINCERE IN SOME OF THE 
COMMITMENTS AND SOME OF THE 
ASSURANCE
22:08:39 S MADE, I THINK THERE 
SHOULD BE NO DIFFICULTY IN 
PUTTING
22:08:43  THAT IN WRITING IN A 
LEASE FORMAT.
22:08:46 
I PERSONALLY WOULD LIKE TO SEE 
THE OHLONE
22:08:51  ENTRANCE BECOME OUR 
MAIN ENTRANCE AND I
22:08:54  THINK NOT 
ONLY IS THIS IN THE MARKET 
DISTRICT
22:08:57  IN THE PARK 
DISTRICT
22:09:01 'S INTEREST BUT IT IS IN 
THE CITY'S INTEREST.
22:09:04 
ONE OF THE THINGS WE NOTICED IN 
THE STUDY
22:09:07  IS THERE WAS NOR 
ATTRACTION TO
22:09:10  BRING THE
22:09:18  
DIRECTION DOWNTOWN.
WE DUMP THEM INTO A
22:09:21  PRIVATE 
NEIGHBORHOOD AND NOWHERE TO GO, 
THEY GO BACK
22:09:24  TO THE FREEWAY 
AGAIN.
ABLY THESE PEOPLE INTO
22:09:27  OHLONE 
HAVE THEM SPEND TIME TO SHOP AT 
THE
22:09:31  LOCAL CAFES AND RESTAURANTS 
THAT WE'LL HAVE ONE DAY
22:09:34  AND TRY 
TO UPLIFT THAT WHOLE AREA.
IF WE ARE
22:09:38  SAYING THAT WE WANT 
OHLONE TO BE THE PRIMARY 
ENTRANCE
22:09:41 , PUT A SINCERE EFFORT 
ON BOTH SIDE
22:09:44  TO MAKE THAT 
HAPPEN.
I THINK ONE PARTY THAT IS 

22:09:47 MISSING ON THE TABLE IS OHLONE 
COLLEGE.
WE
22:09:50  SHOULD ALSO ENGAGE THEM AND 
HAVE SOME SORT OF THREE
22:09:54  WAY 
ARRANGEMENT BECAUSE I THINK 
OHLONE COLLEGE
22:09:57  HAS SOME FEELINGS 
OR INTERESTS THAT WE CAN ALSO 
ADDRESS AS FAR AS
22:10:00  THE CITY GOES.
22:10:06 
SO I THINK THAT PROMOTING OHLONE 
IS ALSO THE WAY
22:10:09  TO PROMOTE 
MISSION SAN JOSE DISTRICT AND TO 
MAKE IT
22:10:12  ONE OF THE KEY 
ATTRACTIONS THAT PEOPLE CAN GO 
TO MISSION
22:10:16  THEY CAN GO TO OHLONE 
COLLEGE YOU HAVE GOT
22:10:19  THE 
HISTORIC MUSEUMS, GREAT 
DOWNTOWN, GREAT VIEWS
22:10:23 , WALK IN 
THE COLLEGE, LOTS OF GREAT 
THINGS TO DO
22:10:27 .
AND SO SPECIFICALLY AS FAR AS
22:10:30  
THE AGREEMENT, I THINK WE HAVE 
SOME MORE WORK TO DO
22:10:33  AND SO SOME 
SPECIFIC COMMENTS REGARDING 
THAT.

22:10:36 ONE IS THAT LIKE I SAID, MAKING 
THE COMMITMENT TO
22:10:39  MAKE OHLONE 
COLLEGE THE MAIN PRIMARY 
ENTRANCE.
22:10:43 
I THINK THE CITY NEEDS TO PUT 
FUNDING, THOUGHT
22:10:46  RIGHT AWAY BUT 
OVER TIME, TO MAKE THAT
22:10:49  A 
PRIMARY ENTRANCE.
I MEAN JUST LOOK AT FACEBOOK.
22:10:52 
WE HAVE THAT STUPID SIGN ON THE 
FRONT
22:10:56 , PEOPLE TAKE PHOTOS, COME 
FROM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY
22:10:59  TO 
POSE IN FRONT OF THAT.
IMAGINE IF
22:11:02  WE PUT THAT RIGHT ON 
MISSION BOULEVARD.
YOU DON'T HAVE
22:11:05  TO CLIMB THE 
PEAK, YOU CAN TAKE IT THERE AND 
INVITE
22:11:08  THEM FOR THE EXPERIENCE.
SECOND
22:11:12  IS THE CAPITAL 
IMPROVEMENTS WE WANT TO FOCUS 
MORE
22:11:15  AT OHLONE COLLEGE.
I THINK THAT'S THE KEY
22:11:19 .
HOW DO WE MAKE THAT BETTER?
22:11:22 
CLARIFYING THE LANGUAGE ABOUT 
ABILITY
22:11:26  TO CLOSE THE PARK, AND I 
THINK
22:11:29  THERE'S SOME AMBIGUITY 
ABOUT WHAT WE
22:11:32  FEEL, WHAT WE 
INTERPRET IT AND THE WAY THE 
PARK DISTRICT
22:11:35  IS INTERPRET IT.
I THINK THAT NEEDS TO BE 
CLARIFIED BECAUSE
22:11:39  WE DON'T WANT 
TO HAVE LAWSUITS OR INJUNCTIONS
22:11:42  
OR DISPUTES IN THE FUTURE.
THERE'S BEEN
22:11:46  MENTION THAT EAST 
BAY PARK DOES NOT WANT TO
22:11:49  EXPAND 
THE PARKING LOT.
WELL, IF THAT IS THE CASE
22:11:53 , I 
DON'T SEE ANYTHING WRONG WITH 
SAYING THAT WE HAVE NO
22:11:56  INTENTION 
OF GOING AHEAD WITH THE PARKING 
LOT.

22:11:59 BECAUSE ULTIMATELY IT IS A 
DECISION THAT THE CITY WILL HAVE 
TO APPROVE
22:12:02  ANYWAY SO I DON'T 
UNDERSTAND WHAT THE MARKET 
DISTRICT
22:12:06  GETS OF NOT PUTTING 
THAT IN THERE IF THAT IS
22:12:10  THEIR 
INTENTION.
THAT WOULD BUILD TRUST
22:12:13  AND 
CONFIDENCE, AND BETTER DEAL WITH 
THAT.

22:12:16 HOURS OF OPERATION, I
22:12:19  THINK WE 
NEED TO HAVE MORE CONCRETE
22:12:24  ITEM 
WHAT THE HOURS ARE GOING TO BE.
I THINK A COMMUNITY MEETING
22:12:28  IS 
NOT ENOUGH FOR OUR RESIDENTS
22:12:31  
BECAUSE UNILATERALLY THE PARK 
DISTRICT
22:12:35  CAN DECIDE THE NUMBER 
OF HOURS OR HOW LONG.
22:12:38 
MAYBE THEY EXPAND THE HOURS 
AGAIN AND WE HAVE THOSE
22:12:42  SAME 
ISSUES THAT WE HAVE BEFORE.
REGARDING
22:12:45  THE LEASE, 25 YEARS IS 
VERY LONG.
I
22:12:48  THINK WE NEED TO HAVE SOME 
SORT OF BUILT IN MECHANISM THAT
22:12:51  
WE HAVE PERIODIC REVIEW.
22:12:55 
MAYBE IT'S FIVE YEARS, CHECK IN 
HOW IS
22:12:58  EVERYTHING GOING, WHAT 
CAN WE DO BETTER?
HOW CAN WE
22:13:01  ALL WORK BETTER 
TOGETHER?
AND THEN OF COURSE THE ISSUES
22:13:04  
ABOUT RESTORATION AND PRESERVING 
THE PARK.
22:13:07 
HOW CAN WE MAKE IT BETTER?
WHAT CAN WE DO TO
22:13:10  RESTORE THESE 
TRAILS THAT HAVE BEEN DESTROYED 
BY
22:13:14  RAMPANT FOLKS COMING THROUGH 
HERE.
THOSE ARE SOME OF THE IDEAS,
22:13:17  
SOME OF THE THOUGHTS I HAVE, I'D 
LIKE TO GET WITH
22:13:20  MY COLLEAGUES 
AND SEE HOW WE CAN PUT IT 
TOGETHER AND SOME
22:13:23  SORT OF 
FEEDBACK FOR THE PARK DISTRICT 
SO THEY
22:13:26  DID TAKE IT BACK AND 
DEAL WITH ALL
22:13:29  OF THIS.
MR. O'
22:13:33 CONNOR YOU HAVE BEEN VERY 
PATIENT
22:13:36  AND I'VE ENJOYED THE 
INTERACTIONS WITH YOU
22:13:39 .
>> YOU'RE WELCOME.
>> Mayor Mei:   I WAS GOING TO
22:13:43  
MENTION RAJ, THANK YOU, I KNOW 
THAT EARLIER THIS YEAR WE
22:13:46  HAVE 
TOURED THE CORNER OF PINE AND WE 
HAVE
22:13:49  STARTED SOME OF THEM IN THE 
PAST WITH THE MISSION STUDIES
22:13:52  
AND WE ALSO TOOK CONGRESS
22:13:56  PERSON 
KHANNA ON A TOUR, SO
22:13:59  WE'RE 
ALREADY MAKING SOME OF THOSE 
INFRASTRUCTURE
22:14:02  IMPACTS, ONE OF 
THE THINGS
22:14:06  WE NEED THE SUPPORT 
OF THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE ON,
22:14:08  
THE DOWNTOWN AREA OF MISSION SAN 
JOSE REQUIRES THE COMMUNITY TO 

22:14:12 STEP FORWARD AND TO HELP US WITH 
SUPPORT WHETHER IT'S SUPPORTING 
THE
22:14:15  BUSINESSES OR SUPPORTING THE 
DESIGN OF SOME OTHER 
OPPORTUNITIES
22:14:18 .
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW AS YOU LOOK AT 
MISSION SAN JOSE ONE OF THE
22:14:21  
GREATEST CHALLENGES IF YOU
22:14:24  
RECALL OF THE STUDY FROM 
COMMERCE IT WAS JUST ONE SIDE OF 

22:14:27 THE STREET.
IT WOULD HAVE TO BE SOMETHING ON 
BOTH SIDES OF THE
22:14:31  STREET 
REALISTICALLY TO GET FOOT 
TRAFFIC THROUGH THERE.
22:14:34 
SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS 
I WANTED TO
22:14:37  ECHO.
I SUPPORT YOUR IDEA OF
22:14:40  
CONSERVATION AND REVISITING.
NEXT FOR COUNCILMEMBERS
22:14:43  IS 
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN.
>> Councilmember Kassan:   THANK 

22:14:46 YOU.
I VERY MUCH SECOND EVERYTHING 
THAT COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN SAID
22:14:49 .
I THINK THOSE WERE
22:14:52  EXCELLENT 
COMMENTS.
AND JUST TO -- I HAVE THREE MAIN 

22:14:55 CONCERNS THAT I JUST WANT TO 
MAKE SURE TO EMPHASIZE.
ONE IS
22:14:59  I REALLY DO THINK IT IS 
IRRESPONSIBLE TO
22:15:02  HAVE FREE 
PARKING AT THIS TIME OF WHERE WE 
ARE IN THE
22:15:05  HISTORY OF OUR 
PLANET.
22:15:09 
WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO OFFER FREE 
PARKING ESPECIALLY IN AN
22:15:12  AREA 
WHERE PEOPLE ARE DRIVING AROUND 
AND AROUND LOOKING FOR PARK
22:15:14 ING.
IT'S REALLY BAD FOR THE 
ENVIRONMENT.

22:15:17 WE CLAIM TO BE A CITY THAT CARES 
ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE
22:15:20  AND THAT IS 
NOT CONSISTENTLY WITH T
22:15:23  CONSISTENT WITH THAT.
I REALLY
22:15:27  APPRECIATE KELVIN CHOW 
FOR BRINGING THAT UP
22:15:31 .
MAYOR MEI SAYS THERE IS A COST 
FOR CHARGING FOR PARK
22:15:34 ING BUT 
THAT ISN'T NECESSARILY THE CASE 
BECAUSE WHEN
22:15:37  WE INSTITUTED THE 
PERMIT PARKING IN THE 
NEIGHBORHOOD, APPARENTLY FROM
22:15:40  
WHAT WE WERE TOLD, THAT IS 
ACTUALLY NOT COSTING
22:15:44  US ANYTHING 
BECAUSE THE REVENUES FROM THAT 
ARE ACTUALLY COVERING THE COST
22:15:47 .
SO THERE DOESN'T HAVE TO BE A 
COST TO HAVING PAID PARK
22:15:50 ING.
22:15:54 
AND I JUST THINK IT IS VERY 
IRRESPONSIBLE TO
22:15:58  HAVE FREE 
PARKING ESPECIALLY SINCE THE 
OHLONE
22:16:01  PARKING LOT CHARGES.
THE LEASE SAYS
22:16:04  THAT UNLESS THE 
CITY ACCEPTS OR
22:16:08  REJECTS 
IMPROVEMENTS THAT THOSE 
IMPROVEMENTS ARE DEEMED
22:16:11  
APPROVED.
THAT MEANS THAT ANY
22:16:15  PROPOSED 
IMPROVEMENTS ARE VERY UNLIKELY 
TO COME TO COUNCIL.

22:16:18 WE WOULD BE RELYING ON STAFF TO
22:16:21  
RESPOND WITHIN 30 DAYS OR 90 
DAYS DEPENDING ON
22:16:25  WHICH CLAUSE 
OF THE LEASE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT 
AND IF THERE ISN'T
22:16:28  A TIMELY 
RESPONSE IT'S DEEMED APPROVED.

22:16:31 I DO NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH 
THAT AT ALL.
THIRD, I'M
22:16:34  REALLY SHOCKED ABOUT 
THE FACT THAT THERE IS OBVIOUSLY 
NOT A
22:16:37  MEETING OF THE MINDS.
I DON'T WANT TO READ THE QUOTES
22:16:40  
AGAIN BUT THERE IS A DISTRICT 
CONTRADICTION BETWEEN WHAT THE 

22:16:43 ATTORNEY FOR THE PARKS DISTRICT 
SAID AND WHAT OUR STAFF SAID.
22:16:46 
COMPLETELY CONTRADICTS EACH 
OTHER.

22:16:49 THAT MEANS THERE IS NO MEETING 
OF THE MINDS.
WE CANNOT HAVE
22:16:52  A LEASE WHERE 
THERE'S NO MEETING OF THE MINDS.
THERE HAS
22:16:55  TO BE CLARITY ON WHAT 
THE LEASE IS ACTUALLY SAYING 
ABOUT
22:16:58  THAT ISSUE IN CASE WE HAD 
ANOTHER SITUATION WHERE WE
22:17:01  HAD 
TO CLOSE THAT STREET OR THAT 
PARK ENTRANCE.

22:17:04 SO THOSE ARE MY THREE BIGGEST 
CONCERNS BUT, YOU KNOW,
22:17:08  I 
DEFINITELY SUPPORT ALL OF THE 
OTHER CONCERNS THAT 

22:17:11 COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN BROUGHT UP.
THANK YOU.
22:17:15 
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.
I'M GRAD TO HEAR THERE'S SOME 

22:17:18 CONSENSUS WITHIN THE COUNCIL.
I WANTED TO CLARIFY ONE OF THE
22:17:21  
COMMENTS MADE BY COUNCILMEMBER 
KASSAN AND I'M LOOKING TO
22:17:25  SEE 
THE SEAN WASHINGTON IS STILL ON
22:17:29 .
I JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY THAT 
EITHER HE OR I'M
22:17:32  LOOKING FOR
22:17:36  -- 
I DON'T SEE THE GENTLEMAN -- OH 
THERE,
22:17:39  EITHER ONE OF OUR POLICE 
WOULD BE ABLE TO CLARIFY.
WAS THERE A
22:17:42  COST OR IS THERE A 
COST FOR MAINTAINING THE 
PERMITTING AS
22:17:45  IT STANDS TODAY?
AND WHAT WE'VE
22:17:48  SEEN IS, HAS THE 
PARKING FROM BOTH OF YOUR
22:17:51  
PERSPECTIVES MOVED FURTHER OUT, 
BECAUSE JUST BECAUSE WE CHARGE 

22:17:55 FOR PARKING DOESN'T MEAN THAT 
PEOPLE WON'T PARK, JUST
22:17:59  PEOPLE 
WILL PARK FURTHER MOVES INTO A 
DIFFERENT
22:18:02  PART OF THE
22:18:05  
NEIGHBORHOOD, WHICH MAKES IT 
MORE DIFFICULT
22:18:08  IN ANOTHER PART.
CAN YOU RESPOND TO THAT?
>> THE
22:18:11  PARK COMPLIANCE OFFICERS, 
I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE'RE 
REFERENCE
22:18:14 ING.
WE DID COST THAT OUT AND WE'RE 
FEDERATE
22:18:17  CONFIDENT THAT THE 
REVENUE RECEIVED FROM CITATIONS
22:18:20  
WILL COVER THE COST OF THOSE TWO 
POSITIONS.

22:18:23 SO THAT'S WHAT IT WAS DESIGNED 
TO DO.
I KNOW WE,
22:18:26  WITH COVID AND 
EVERYTHING WE GOT KIND OF A SLOW 
START SO
22:18:29  I DON'T HAVE THE 
NUMBERS IN FRONT OF ME OF 
WHETHER OR NOT THAT
22:18:33  ACTUALLY WAS 
REALIZED.
22:18:36  DURING THE TIME LINE WE 
ANTICIPATED BUT
22:18:39  WE'RE PRETTY 
CONFIDENT THAT ONCE THINGS START 
TO SETTLE AND WE
22:18:43  GET SOME 
MOMENTUM THAT THAT WOULD INDEED 
BE THE CASE.
22:18:46 
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.
AND HAVE WE HAD PEOPLE TRY
22:18:50  THE 
PLEA OUT OF THE PARKING SAYING
22:18:53  I 
FORGOT MY PARKING AND
22:18:56  WHATNOT.
PARKING TICKETS WHEN YOU GET ONE 
YOU MIGHT
22:19:00  NOT BE AS EXCITED.
I JUST WANT TO CAUTION THAT.
22:19:03 
HAVE WE HAD PEOPLE SAYING, I
22:19:06  
ACTUALLY LIVE HERE, I FORGOT THE 
PULL MY PERMIT OUT
22:19:10  OR WHATNOT.
>> SURE, THAT IS ALWAYS
22:19:13  INVOLVED 
IN ANY TYPE OF ENFORCEMENT 
ACTION WE
22:19:16  DO HAVE.
WE DO HAVE FOLKS THAT DEPUTY
22:19:19  THE 
TICKETS OR THE VALIDITY OF THE 
CITATION, THAT IS
22:19:22  PART OF THE 
SITUATION AS WELT.
22:19:25 
WE TAKE THOSE CASE-BY-CASE AND 
VALIDATE EACH
22:19:28  ONE AS WE GET 
THEM.
BUT WE DO HAVE THOSE
22:19:31  DISPUTES 
EVERY SO OFTEN.
>> Mayor Mei:   OKAY GREAT THANK 

22:19:35 YOU.
I JUST WANTED TO REMIND PEOPLE 
BECAUSE HAVING BEEN IN
22:19:38  CITIES 
WHERE THEY DO TICKET ALL TIME 
FOR PARKING IT IS SOMETHING THAT
22:19:41  
YOU MAY NOT BE AS EXCITED WHEN 
YOU RECEIVE ONE
22:19:44 .
SO VICE MAYOR SHAO COMMENTS
22:19:48 .
>> Councilmember Shao:   THANK 
YOU, MADAM MAYOR.

22:19:51 I ECHO MOST OF WHAT 
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN JUST
22:19:54  SAID.
BUT HE DID NOT
22:19:58  QUOTE 
CONFIDUCIARY
22:20:01  CONF
22:20:04 UCIOUS 
SAID
22:20:08 , CONFUCION SAID,
22:20:15  CONFU
22:20:18 CIOUS SAID YOU CANNOT 
STEP INTO
22:20:21  THE SAME REFER RIVER 
AGAIN.
ONE GOAL
22:20:24  IS TO
22:20:27  OF COURSE 
REJOINING MISSION SAN JOSE 
COMMERCIAL
22:20:30  DISTRICT OOCHES AND I 
UNDERSTAND IT'S ON EVERYONE'S 
MIND
22:20:34  BUT IT IS OUT OF COMMON 
SENSE
22:20:37  IF OHLONE COLLEGE CHARGES 
$4 WHILE THERE'S
22:20:41  FREE PARKING
22:20:44  ON 
STANFORD STREET.
SO THERE HAS TO BE
22:20:47  SOMETHING 
DONE ABOUT THAT IN ORDER TO
22:20:50  
REDIRECT PEOPLE TO THE OHLONE 
ENTRANCE.

22:20:53 AND THAT IS SO OBVIOUS AND SO 
OUT OF
22:20:56  COMMON SENSE.
SO FOR THAT, I CERTAINLY HOPE
22:20:59  
THAT WE CAN DO SOMETHING.

22:21:02 ONE MORE THING ABOUT THE PARKING
22:21:06  
LOT, OR SOME MAJOR IMPROVEMENT
22:21:09 .
MY UNDERSTANDING IS
22:21:13  THAT THERE 
LIKE A
22:21:16  60 DAYTIME PERIOD FOR US 
TO MAKE THE RESPONSE
22:21:19 .
SO I BELIEVE WITHIN
22:21:23  THE 60 DAYS, 
SUCH MAJOR IMPROVEMENT SHOULD BE
22:21:26  
BROUGHT TO THE CITY COUNCIL FOR 
APPROVAL
22:21:30 .
AND HOPEFULLY DURING THAT PERIOD 
OF TIME
22:21:33 , THE CITY GOVERNMENT
22:21:37  
WOULD DO ITS BEST TO
22:21:40  INVITE THE 
PUBLIC TO PARTICIPATE
22:21:43  IN THE 
WHOLE PROCESS.
22:21:46 
SO I THINK THE 60 DAY
22:21:50  MAY BE 
LONG ENOUGH TO COVER THOSE 
EVENTS LIKE
22:21:53  MAJOR IMPROVEMENTS.
22:21:56 
AS OR THE THE REST, I DON'T WANT 
TO REPEAT.

22:21:59 BUT AS I SAID I ECHO MOST PART
22:22:03  
OF COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN'S 
COMMENTS
22:22:08 .
AND I CERTAINLY DON'T
22:22:11  THINK I 
CAN ACCEPT
22:22:14  THE AGREEMENT AS-IS
22:22:17 , 
TODAY.
SEEMS LIKE WHAT
22:22:20  CHANGED FROM 25 
YEARS AGO WAS SOME
22:22:23  ADDITION OF 
THE CLAUSES WHICH ARE MUCH
22:22:26  
HARSHER ON US, NOT THE OPPOSITE
22:22:30 .
SO THAT
22:22:33  BASICALLY IS SOMETHING 
THAT CONCERNS ME.

22:22:38 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU, I'M 
NOT QUOTING
22:22:43  CON FUC
22:22:46 IOUS EITHER 
BIT I'M GOING TO THE
22:22:49  NEXT 
COUNCILMEMBER,
22:22:52  COUNCILMEMBER 
JONES.
>> Councilmember Jones:   THANK 

22:22:55 YOU, MADAM MAYOR.
WE MAY NOT BE HERE IN 25
22:22:58  YEARS, 
I KNOW HE MEANS NOT ON
22:23:02  THE 
COUNCIL BUT I HOPE HE MEANS IN 
GENERAL 
22:23:05 .
CLARIFYING THINGS, THANK YOU 
SUZANNE AND JIM
22:23:09  O'CONNOR FOR ALL 
THE WORK YOU'VE DONE ON
22:23:12  THIS, I 
KNOW YOU'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS 
FOR A VERY LONG
22:23:15  TIME.
BUT CLARIFYING THINGS,
22:23:18  SUE 
DANIEL, COMMUNITY MEETINGS WERE 
OPEN
22:23:22  TO EVERYBODY NOT JUST THE 
RESIDENTS OF THE IMMEDIATE
22:23:26  AREA 
CORRECT?
GOOD THAT IS CORRECT.
22:23:29 
>> Councilmember Jones:   I 
AGREE WITH
22:23:32  COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN, 
I DON'T THINK ANY OF THOSE 
REQUESTS
22:23:36  WERE UNREASONABLE.
IF WE WERE TO SEND THIS BACK
22:23:39  TO 
EAST BAY REENL AND SAY COULD
22:23:43  REGIONAL AND SAY,
22:23:46  COULD 
WE GET THIS IN WRITING, I DON'T 
THINK THERE
22:23:49  WOULD BE PUSH BACK 
ON THAT.
THE OHLONE ENTRANCE
22:23:53 , YOU'RE 
GETTING CONVERSATIONS WITH 
GOOGLE AND NOT
22:23:56  GETTING A LOT OF 
TRACTION GETTING STANFORD LANE
22:23:59  
REMOVED FROM GOOGLE MAPS AND 
THOSE KINDS OF THINGS
22:24:02 .
WOULD A SOMEWHAT CHEAPER OPTION 
BE
22:24:06  TO INSTALL MAYBE SOME 
ADDITIONAL SIGNAGE
22:24:09  ALONG MISSION 
BOULEVARD THOUGHT ONLY DOWN BY 
STANFORD LANE
22:24:12  BUT EVEN FURTHER 
BACK TO PROMOTE THE OHLONE 
ENTRANCE
22:24:16 , AND EITHER
22:24:19  AT THE 
CITY'S EXPENSE OR A SHARED 
EXPENSE OR WHAT HAVE YOU
22:24:22 , I 
SEEMS TO BE LIKE IT WOULD BE 
SOMEWHAT OF A CHEAP
22:24:25 ER OPTION.
SO I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S BEEN 
DISCUSSED.
22:24:28 
AND THEN THE OTHER QUESTION I
22:24:31  
HAD REGARDING THE PAID PARKING 
ISSUE AT THE STANFORD
22:24:34  PARKING 
LOT, WELL TWO THINGS REALLY
22:24:37 , 
NUMBER 1, WHO WOULD ENFORCE US 
BECAUSE OF OUR
22:24:41  LIMITED STAFFING 
AND SORORITIES?
AND NUMBER 2
22:24:44  RESOURCES?
22:24:47 
AND HAS THERE BEEN A COST 
ANALYSIS WHAT IT
22:24:50  WOULD TAKE TO 
PUT IN EVEN JUST A KIOSK
22:24:53 , IT 
REQUIRES POWER, MAINTENANCE, 
THOSE KINDS OF THINGS
22:24:56 .
HAS THERE BEEN ANY KIND OF COST 
ANALYSIS DONE ON WHAT
22:24:59  IT WOULD 
TAKE TO INSTALL A KIOSK, NUMBER 
THE SPACE
22:25:02 S, AND INSTITUTE A 
PROGRAM THERE
22:25:06 ?
SO IF YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT 
THAT,
22:25:09  IF THAT'S BEEN DONE IN THE 
PAST.

22:25:13 >> I WOULD LOOK TO MY COLLEAGUE 
JIM
22:25:16  O'CONNOR FOR THAT ANSWER.
>> COUNCILMEMBER JONES,
22:25:19  WE DID 
DO SOME COST ANALYSIS ON PAID 
PARK
22:25:23 ING SEVERAL YEARS AGO.
I DON'T HAVE THOSE
22:25:27  NUMBERS OFF 
THE TOP OF MY HEAD, WE
22:25:31  HAVE NOT 
LOOKED AT THAT.
REMEMBER THIS IS
22:25:34  A VERY SMALL 
PARKING LOT.
TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS
22:25:38  ABOUT 
SIGNAGE, PART OF OUR MITIGATION 
OF
22:25:41  STANFORD, IF WE WORKED WITH 
THE CITY TO REMOVE THE
22:25:44  SIGN THAT 
HIGHLIGHTED THE STANFORD ACCESS 
POINT AT
22:25:48  STANFORD AVENUE SO THAT 
SIGN THIS WAY FINDING SIGN ON
22:25:51  
MISSION BOULEVARD WAS REMOVED.
AND WE DID PUT AND MOVE
22:25:54  THE SIGN 
THAT POINTS PEOPLE COMING FROM
22:25:58  
THE MAJORITY OF VISITORS OUT OF 
TOWN VISIT
22:26:01 ORS ARE COMING FROM 
680 AND WE ADDED A SIGN AT
22:26:04  PINE 
STREET TO HIGHLIGHT THE ENTRANCE 
AT OHLONE COLLEGE
22:26:07 .
ESSENTIALLY THE MAJORITY OF 
VISITORS COMING FROM 6
22:26:10 80 THAT'S 
THE SIGN THEY SEE SO WE DID SOME 
WORK
22:26:13  IN THAT AREA.
AND I CAN'T REMEMBER IF THERE 
WAS A
22:26:17  THIRD QUESTION YOU HAD 
ASKED BUT THAT'S MY ANSWERS TO 
THE FIRST
22:26:20  TWO QUESTIONS.
>> Councilmember Jones:   NO I 
THINK YOU COVERED IT
22:26:23  PRETTY 
MUCH.
I WAS JUST CURIOUS DEPENDING ON 

22:26:26 WHAT TYPE OF PARKING FACILITY, 
IF IT WAS
22:26:29  AN ELECTRONIC THING 
LIKE OHLONE COLLEGE HAS
22:26:32  WHERE 
YOU'RE ENTERING THE NUMBER AND 
ALL THAT KIND OF THING
22:26:36 , THAT'S 
GOING TO
22:26:40  REQUIRE A 
INFRASTRUCTURE NUMBER WHICH IS 
NOT CHEAP
22:26:43 , IS IT FEASIBLE 
LOOKING AT THE
22:26:46  STATE PARKS DO 
WHEN YOU'RE ON AN HONOR
22:26:49  SYSTEM 
WITH A DROP BOX.
BUT THEN AGAIN THE
22:26:52  ISSUE BECOMES 
WHO IS GOING TO ENFORCE THE 
PARKING IN THAT
22:26:56  AREA, WITH THE 
LIMITED STAFFING AND RESOURCES 
THAT
22:26:59  WE HAVE.
22:27:02 
ANYWAY THOSE ARE ALL THE 
CLARIFYING QUESTIONS I HAVE.

22:27:05 I AGREE WITH MOST OF THE 
COMMENTS THAT COUNCILMEMBER 
SALWAN MADE AND
22:27:08  I REALLY 
APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT YOU AND
22:27:11  
SUZANNE HAVE DONE ON THIS.
I THINK WITH A LITTLE BIT OF
22:27:14  
TWEAKING IT WOULD PROBABLY BE A 
LITTLE MORE PALATABLE
22:27:18  TO THE 
RESIDENTS.
I WOULD ENCOURAGE THE CONTINUED
22:27:20  
OUTREACH.
I KNOW YOU GUYS HAVE CHANGED 

22:27:23 YOUR SITE TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO 
GO TO THE OHLONE TRAIL, WHATEVER
22:27:26  
WE CAN DO TO PROMOTE THAT WOULD 
PROBABLY BE VERY BENEFICIAL
22:27:30 .
AND MAYBE A FEW EXTRA SIGNS 
ALONG MISSION
22:27:33  BOULEVARD, 
SOMEWHAT OF A CHEAPER RESPONSE 
BUT ANYWAY
22:27:37  THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR 
ALL THAT YOU HAVE DONE.
22:27:39 
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU, 
COUNCILMEMBER JONES FOR YOUR 

22:27:42 COMMENT.
I WAS GOING TO SAY MAYBE WE 
SHOULD INCORPORATE
22:27:45  WHAT I'VE 
SAID IN SOME OTHER UNIVERSITIES 
AND
22:27:49  WITH SOCIAL MEDIA, WE ARE 
COMING UP WITH SMALL BUSINESS 
WEEK
22:27:52  COMING UP AND IN CAL POL
22:27:55 LY 
WHERE MY DAUGHTER WEPT TO
22:27:58  
SCHOOL, WE HAVE THE PEAK 
CHALLENGE,
22:28:02  YOU CLIMB MISSION 
PEAK AND YOU
22:28:05  GET A FREE TRI-
22:28:09 TIP 
SANDWICH, YOU WOULD BE AMAZED
22:28:12  
AWAY KIDS WOULD DO, I CAN'T 
REMEMBER
22:28:16  WHICH COUNCILMEMBER 
MENTIONED HAVING THE FACEBOOK 
SIGN OR
22:28:19  THE NEW SIGN, THE
22:28:22  NEW 
RAGE, EVERYBODY HAS TO TAKE A 
PICTURE ON
22:28:25  THAT SIDE.
WE HAVE A PICTURE THIS,
22:28:28  MAYBE 
YOU HAVE A BACKDROP YOU HAVE A 
PICTURE OF IT,
22:28:31  YOU DON'T HAVE TO 
CLIMB THE PEAK, THAT HAS
22:28:35  TO HAVE 
SOMETHING THAT HELPS DIRECTLY, 
IF THAT IS
22:28:38  THE MOVE AND WE WANT 
TO GET THAT MOVED
22:28:41  TO THE 
DIRECTION OF OHLONE WE NEED TO 
INCLUDE OHLONE COLLEGE
22:28:44  IN THIS 
CONVERSATION.
I APPRECIATE JIM DIRECTOR
22:28:48  
O'CONNOR MENTIONING EARLIER THE
22:28:51  
OUTREACH TO DR. BISHOP GET
22:28:54 TING 
THE STUDENTS INCLUDED, THAT 
WOULD BE A HUGE
22:28:58  PUSH TO GET 
SOCIAL MEDIA IN THAT AREA.
COUNCILMEMBER COX
22:29:02 .
I'M SORRY, COUNCILMEMBER?
YOU'RE ON MUTE
22:29:05 .
>> Councilmember Cox:   YES, AS 
WE TALK ABOUT OHLONE COLLEGE WE
22:29:08  
GOT TO HAVE THEM AT THE TABLE.
BUT I REALLY THINK
22:29:12  WE GOT TO 
REALLY COME TOGETHER AS A NEW 
BRANDING
22:29:16  OF WAS CALLED BRAND 
MARKETING
22:29:19 .
AND PART OF IT IS THAT IT STARTS
22:29:22  
WITH THE SIGNS, YES, IT STARTS 
WITH ENCOURAGING
22:29:25  PEOPLE TO 
PARTICIPATE
22:29:28 .
THE OTHER
22:29:32  PART IS WE'VE GOT TO 
GO AND LOOK AT
22:29:35  MIGRATING SOME OF 
THE SEARCH ENGINE OPTIMIZE
22:29:38 ATION, 
SEO AND WORKING TOWARDS
22:29:41  GETTING 
IT MORE TO
22:29:44  ELEVATE OHLONE 
COLLEGE AND HAVE THAT VISITED 
AND A LOT OF
22:29:47  THAT IS A LOT OF 
CONSULTING WORK AND BRAND
22:29:50  
MARKETING AND DIGITAL OPTIMIZING 
THAT
22:29:54  CAN DRIVE THE TRAFFIC.
AND
22:29:57  SOME OF IT COULD BE SOME OF 
OUR COLLEGE STUDENTS AT
22:30:00  OHLONE 
COLLEGE TO BE AN INTERNSHIP 
OPPORTUNITY
22:30:03  TO HELP US IN THAT 
AREA
22:30:07 .
TO DEVELOP THAT.
22:30:10 
BECAUSE OUR STUDENTS ARE VERY 
SMART BEING A TRUSTEE FOR 12 

22:30:14 YEARS AT OHLONE I COULD TRULY 
TESTIFY THAT WE'VE RUN A
22:30:17  LOT OF 
DIFFERENT COMPETITIONS 
ESPECIALLY IN THE I.T.
22:30:20  AND 
TECHNOLOGY AREA AND, YOU KNOW, 
WE
22:30:23  WOULD LOVE TO HAVE THAT
22:30:26  
CONVERSATION WITH THE CITY STAFF 
TO TALK WITH DR. BISHOP,
22:30:30  THE 
PRESIDENT OF OHLONE COLLEGE.
ANOTHER PART ALSO
22:30:33  IS EMPHASIZING 
THE IMPORTANCE
22:30:36  OF, IT'S MORE 
THAN JUST DOING A CONTRACT.
22:30:39 
BUT HOW WELL WE'RE MEETING THE 
NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY
22:30:42 .
AND HAVING A PLACE THAT
22:30:46  WE 
INCLUDE IN WRITING THAT WE
22:30:49  WILL 
LOOK AT EACH TIME BEFORE WE
22:30:52  
RENEW THE CONTRACT.
I DON'T AGREE WITH THE 25
22:30:55 .
I'VE STATED IT BEFORE, THAT, YOU 
KNOW, LOOKING AT
22:30:58  FIVE WITH 
RENEWABLE OPTIONS, BUT WE HAVE 
GOT TO
22:31:01  HAVE A TALK OF A 
PERFORMANCE
22:31:05  REVIEW AND DOING A 
FULL 360 WHETHER IT'S
22:31:08  THE CITY 
LEADERSHIP TO SEE HOW THINGS ARE
22:31:11  
AS BEEN REPORTED BY OUR FIRE 
CHIEF,
22:31:14  BY OUR POLICE CHIEF, BY 
OUR WHOLE
22:31:18  ENTIRE CITY COUNCIL.
AND ALSO REPRESENTATIVES
22:31:21  WHETHER 
THEY'RE VISITORS OR WHETHER 
THEY'RE THE
22:31:24  COMMUNITY WHO TAKES 
ADVANTAGE OF
22:31:27  THE MISSION PEAK 
THAT WE NEED TO DO A FULL REVIEW 
TO
22:31:31  MAKE SURE THAT EVERY VOICE IS 
BEING HEARD
22:31:35 .
AND IT'S NOT BECAUSE SOME ARE 
APPOINTED TO
22:31:38  THE COMMUNITY 
LIAISON COMMITTEE BUT PEOPLE 
THAT ARE NOT
22:31:42  APPOINTED, AND 
PEOPLE THAT ARE A COMBINATION OF 
ALL THE ABOVE
22:31:46 .

22:31:53 .
ALLOWING SOME PARTICIPATION AND
22:31:56  
PERIODIC REGULAR REVIEWS.
BUT CERTAINLY BEFORE ANY
22:31:59  TYPE OF 
REVIEW I THINK 25 YEARS IS MORE 
OF A HANDS
22:32:02 -OFF AND I DO 
CONTRACTS FOR A LIVING AND I 
HAVE NEVER
22:32:06  SEEN 25 YEARS, VERY 
RARE.
VERY RARE
22:32:09  WITHOUT CHECKPOINTS 
AND SEEING HOW THINGS ARE GOING
22:32:13 .
AND ALSO, I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT
22:32:17  
THAT WHEN WE LOOK AT SOME OF THE 
CONTRACT LANGUAGE
22:32:20 , WHEN YOU ARE 
LOOKING AT THE PROPERTY RIGHTS, 
I REALLY
22:32:23  THINK WE NEED TO KIND 
OF REPHRASE USING
22:32:26  THE WORD 
EXCLUSIVE CONTROL.
22:32:31 
AND SOLE AUTHORITY.
I THINK THAT THOSE WORD
22:32:34 ING IT'S 
MAKING IT VERY STRONG THAT WE
22:32:37  AS 
THE CITY OF FREMONT DO NOT HAVE 
ANY
22:32:41  OTHER SAY, CONTROL, REVIEW
22:32:44 , 
OVERSIGHT, AND WE BEING
22:32:47  THE 
OWNERS, CITY OF FREMONT BEING 
THE OWNERS
22:32:50  OF THIS PROPERTY AND 
WE'RE, YOU KNOW, WORKING IN
22:32:54  
CONJUNCTION WITH THE EAST BAY 
PARKS TO ALLOW THEM
22:32:57  TO MANAGE 
THE PARK ON SOME OF THESE 
DAY-TO-DAY
22:33:01  OPERATIONS AND 
CONSERVATION INITIATIVES
22:33:04  WITH 
THE CLIMATE CHANGE.
BUT WE
22:33:07  SHOULD ALL TIMES, THE 
CITY OF FREMONT SHOULD BE ABLE 
TO HAVE
22:33:10 , RESERVE THE RIGHT 
WITHOUT LIMITATION TO BE ABLE TO 
TAKE
22:33:14  ACTIONS THAT ARE NECESSARY 
TO
22:33:17  HELP MAKE SURE THAT WE STILL
22:33:20  
HAVE A WAY TO PREVENT A LOSS OF 
LIFE,
22:33:23  PREVENT FIRE, CRIME, BE 
ABLE TO MAINTAIN
22:33:26  PUBLIC SAFETY.
AND HELP PRESERVE THE LAND
22:33:29  OR 
PROPERTY.
AND SO I THINK THAT THAT'S
22:33:32  SOME 
THAT WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE 
SOME SORT OF REWORDING
22:33:36  THERE
22:33:39  IN 
THE PROPERTY RIGHTS SO THAT WE 
CAN BE ABLE TO HAVE SOME SORT
22:33:42  OF 
OVERSIGHT OF THE MANAGEMENT OF 
THE PARK BUT
22:33:45  ALSO ALLOWING AN 
OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO BE ABLE TO 
PROVIDE SOME SORT
22:33:48  OF PERFORMANCE 
AND REVIEWS AND
22:33:52  BE ABLE TO HAVE 
ACTIONS THAT IF WE HAVE TO CALL 
AN
22:33:55  EMERGENCY MEETING THAT WE 
SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO DO THAT AS
22:33:58  
THE CITY OF FREMONT AND NOT BE 
ASKED PERMISSION BY THE EAST BAY
22:34:01  
PARK DISTRICT TO HAVE SUCH 
MEETINGS.

22:34:04 WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO CONDUCT 
BUSINESS FOR THE BEST AND
22:34:08  MAYBE 
WE MAY HAVE TO BE ABLE TO 
RESPOND QUICKER THAN
22:34:11  EAST BAY 
COULD.
AND SO I JUST WANT TO
22:34:14  MAKE SURE 
THAT THAT IS REALLY EMPHASIZED,
22:34:17  
IN THAT PART THERE.
I WANTED TO ALSO
22:34:21  EMPHASIZE WITH 
THE CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS, THERE
22:34:24  
SHOULD BE A DISTINCTION BETWEEN 
MINOR AND MAJOR
22:34:27  CAPITAL 
IMPROVEMENTS AND BEING ABLE TO
22:34:31  
EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE SAYING ONE 
WITH THE MAJOR WOULD HAVE A
22:34:34  
PERMIT, I THINK IT WOULD BE NICE 
AS WE HAVE
22:34:37  THE PARK DISTRICT BE
22:34:40  
ABLE TO RUN THE PARK AND MANAGE
22:34:44  
THE PROPERTY THAT WE KIND OF GET 
TO KNOW LIKE WHAT ARE
22:34:46  SOME OF 
THE OTHER IMPROVEMENTS THAT ARE 
HAPPENING.

22:34:50 SINCE THEY'VE SET ASIDE $400,000 
THAT
22:34:53  THAT WOULD BE SOME SORT OF 
REPORTING THAT COULD COME OUT
22:34:56  TO 
REFLECT SOME OF THE THINGS.
EVEN THOUGH THEY
22:34:59  THINK IT'S 
MINOR AND HAVING THE
22:35:03  APPROVAL 
GRANTED IT WOULD BE NICE TO KNOW 
SOME OF THE THINGS THAT ARE 

22:35:06 HAPPENING.
BECAUSE I DON'T THINK SOMETIMES 
THAT'S NOT AS PUBLIC
22:35:09 LY 
DISCLOSED.
AND TRANSPARENT FOR THE
22:35:12  
COMMUNITY TO BE AWARE OF.
22:35:15 
BUT, YOU KNOW, I'M NOT IN FAVOR
22:35:18  
AS ECHOED BEFORE ON THE SILENCE 
OF
22:35:21  WE'RE NOT GETTING BACK TO YOU 
IN THAT TIME, I
22:35:24  THINK THERE 
SHOULD BE SOME OPPORTUNITY OF 
EXTENSIONS
22:35:28  IN CASE WE NEED MORE 
TIME TO
22:35:31  DO THE ASSESSMENT ON 
CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT AND 
UNDERSTANDING
22:35:34  SOME OF THE IMPACT 
THAT MAY TAKE LONGER.
SO I REALLY
22:35:38  FEEL AT THIS POINT 
BASED ON A LOT OF THE INPUT THAT 
IS
22:35:42  GOING IN, THAT I WOULD LIKE 
TO MAKE A MOTION TO REJECT
22:35:45  THE 
LEASE AND TO
22:35:50  ALLOW THE
22:35:53  CITY OF 
FREMONT AND PROVIDING SOME INPUT 
THAT WE'VE HAD FROM
22:35:56  CITY COUNCIL 
TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE
22:35:59  SOME 
COMMENTS AND EDITS THAT
22:36:03  CAN BE 
REFLECTED
22:36:07  IN REVISING THIS 
LEASE.
SO MY MOTION IS TO REJECT THE
22:36:10  
LEASE AS-IS
22:36:13 .
>> Councilmember Keng:   
ACTUALLY I STILL NEED TO COMMENT
22:36:16 
COMMENT.
>> Mayor Mei:   ACTUALLY I 

22:36:19 APPRECIATE THE MOTION AND WE'LL 
TAKE THAT IF YOU WANT TO FINISH 
YOUR
22:36:22  STATEMENT ON YOUR PROPOSAL 
BUT I WANTED TO
22:36:25  MENTION THAT 
COMMISSIONER JOHNSON IS STILL IN 
THE QUEUE
22:36:29 .
>> Councilmember Cox:   NOT A 
PROBLEM.
22:36:32 
>> Mayor Mei:   ALSO WE'RE GOING 
TO BE HEADING UP ON A BREAK
22:36:34  SOON 
AGAIN.
>> Councilmember Cox:   YES, I 

22:36:38 THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE 
REALLY TAKE A LOOK AND REALLY 
CAREFULLY
22:36:41  REVIEW A LOT OF -- 
SOME OF THIS WORDING THAT'S IN
22:36:44  
THERE TO MAKE SURE THAT IS IT IS
22:36:48  
AN EQUITABLE AGREEMENT FOR ALL 
PARTIES.

22:36:51 AND ALSO ON MAKING SURE THAT 
SOME OF THE THINGS
22:36:54  THAT ARE 
DEFINED IN THE C
22:36:57  SLIDES THAT WERE 
DISCUSS
22:37:01 ED ON THE EAST BAY VERSUS 
CITY OF FREMONT,
22:37:04  THOSE SHOULD BE 
IDENTIFIED, THAT WAS CLEAR THAT 
WAS
22:37:07  MISSING FROM THE AGREEMENT 
THAT WAS SENT TO US, AND I
22:37:10  THINK 
THAT WOULD KIND OF HELP SOLIDIFY 
SOME OF THE
22:37:13  UNDERSTAND BEING OF 
WHO'S DOING WHAT.

22:37:17 AND MAKING SURE THAT'S
22:37:20  CLEAR IN 
THE AGREEMENT AS WELL.
THAT WAS
22:37:23  ANOTHER POINT I WAS 
GOING TO MAKE.

22:37:34 AND THEN ADDING SOME DEFINITIONS 
AS WELL TO MAKE
22:37:37  SURE THAT'S 
CLEAR THAT YOU DEFINE THE 
DIFFERENT TYPES AND WHAT YOU
22:37:40  
MEAN BY MINOR OR MAJOR CAPITAL 
IMPROVEMENTS
22:37:43  I THINK WOULD ALSO 
BE HELPFUL.
AND
22:37:46  I'M ALSO -- WANTED TO
22:37:50  MAKE 
SURE, I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS 
TRUE
22:37:53  OR NOT.
DO WE HAVE A CALL PHONE, A
22:37:56  PHONE 
FOR HELP?
A BLUE PHONE?

22:37:59 I KNOW WE HAD THAT AT OHLONE 
COLLEGE
22:38:02 .
I DIDN'T SEE ONE, BUT I DIDN'T 
WANT
22:38:05  TO BE MISTAKEN THAT THERE 
WOULD BE A DIFFERENT
22:38:09  COLOR OR 
DIFFERENT SETUP.
BUT AT OHLONE
22:38:12  COLLEGE WE HAD 
THIS CALL SYSTEM THAT WE 
INSTITUTED
22:38:15  ACROSS OUR CAMPUS, TO 
GET EMERGENCY HELP, IS
22:38:18  THERE  ONE 
ON THE MISSION PEAK
22:38:22  SIDE OR IS 
IT PURELY DONE BY CELL PHONE
22:38:26 ?
>> COUNCILMEMBER COX, THERE IS 
NO
22:38:29  EMERGENCY PHONE LAND LINE 
PHONE AT THIS LOCATION
22:38:33 .
THAT IS KIND OF OLD TECHNOLOGY 
THAT MOST AGENCIES HAVE GONE
22:38:37  
AWAY FROM, BECAUSE OF THE
22:38:40  L
22:38:47  L
22:38:50  PRO 
LIVE RATION OF CELL PHONES.
>> Councilmember Cox:   I WANT
22:38:53 ED 
TO HAVE THAT DULY CORRECTED 
THANK YOU FOR
22:38:57  CLARIFYING THAT 
MR. O'CONNOR
22:39:00 .
FOR THE OTHER THING IS FOR THE 
TERMINATION
22:39:03  OF THE LEASE I 
REALLY THINK THAT IF THERE IS 
ANY CORRECTION THAT
22:39:06  NEEDS TO BE 
DONE, THAT IT SHOULD CHANGE FROM 
WAITING 90
22:39:09  DAYS TO 30 DAYS.
AND IF
22:39:14  THE IF THE PARK DISTRICT 
NEEDS MORE TIME, THAT
22:39:17  THEY WOULD  
22:39:20  
ADVISE THE CITY OF FREMONT.
BUT I WOULD NOT SAY THAT IT 

22:39:24 WOULD TAKE 90 DAYS TO BE ABLE TO 
CURE A
22:39:27  BREACH ACTION AND WOULD 
LIKE TO SEE THAT
22:39:30  ALSO CHANGED TO 
BE THE 30 DAYS
22:39:34 .
AND I THINK
22:39:40  I'VE MENTIONED 
EVERYTHING ELSE.
I THINK THAT COVERED MOST OF
22:39:43  MY 
COMMENTS.
22:39:47 
BUT ALSO I HAVE STANDING THE 
MOTION.

22:39:50 SO I'LL WAIT TO HEAR FROM THE 
NEXT
22:39:53  PERSON FROM COUNCILMEMBER 
KENG.
THANK YOU
22:39:56 .
>> Mayor Mei:   COUNCILMEMBER 
KENG.

22:39:59 >> Councilmember Keng:   THANK 
YOU MAYOR.
I WILL KEEP IT BRIEF.
22:40:02 
I ALSO AGREE WITH MOST OF THE 
COMMENTS MADE BY
22:40:05  COUNCILMEMBER 
SALWAN.
AND I THINK
22:40:09  THAT FREMONT IS VERY 
PROUD OF HAVING OUR BEAUTIFUL
22:40:12  
MISSION PEAK PARK AREA AND IT 
BEING A PARK
22:40:16  LIKE A MUST-VISIT 
HIKING TRAIL IN THE
22:40:20  EAST BAY AS 
WELL AS PROMPTING FAMILY AND
22:40:23  
FRIENDS TO HIKE THERE AS A 
FRIENDLY COMPETITION AND WE ARE
22:40:26  
BEING MORE ACTIVE.
BUT WE DO NEED
22:40:30  A AMBULANCE FOR
22:40:34  
CONSERVANCY AND NEIGHBORHOOD.
AND BE SENSITIVE FOR THE NUMBER
22:40:37  
OF IMPACTS FOR THE SHEER NUMBER 
OF VISTAORS AND THE
22:40:39  LONG NUMBER 
OF HOURS IT HAS ON THE 
NEIGHBORHOOD.

22:40:43 SO I DO THINK THAT AS FAR AS 
FREE PARKING, I
22:40:46  DO AGREE THAT WE 
ALSO NEED TO
22:40:49  MAKE IT PAID 
PARKING ON THE STANFORD AVENUE
22:40:53  
SIDE AND I THINK OVER TIME, THE 
PARKING
22:40:56  METER SHOULD BE PAYING 
FOR ITSELF.
AND I THINK
22:40:59  THAT ALSO AGREE THAT 
WE NEED TO HAVE WRITING SOME
22:41:02  OF 
THESE AGREEMENTS DURING THE 
NEGOTIATION
22:41:06 .
BECAUSE THIS PARK IS BEING USED 
SO MUCH WE
22:41:09  DO NEED PERIODIC 
REVIEWS AT LEAST EVERY
22:41:12  FIVE 
YEARS TO SEE HOW WE'RE DOING IF 
WE SHOULD BE MAKING
22:41:15  ADJUSTMENTS 
TO MAKE IT WORK.
I APPRECIATE EVERYONE'S WORK
22:41:19 .
WE DO NEED MORE PARK SPACES THAT 
PEOPLE CAN VISIT
22:41:22  BUT WE ALSO 
NEED TO BE ACCOUNTABLE
22:41:25  F
22:41:28  ACCOUNTABLE FOR 
CONSERVANCY.
THANK YOU.
22:41:29 
>> Mayor Mei:   WE HAVE A 
MOTION.

22:41:32 I WOULD SUPPORT THE IDEA OF 
GOING BACK TO THE
22:41:36  TABLE WITH 
SOME OF THE DIFFERENT TERMS.
I WOULD JUST DEFER THAT
22:41:39  WHILE WE 
HAVE CERTAIN REQUESTS,
22:41:43  USUALLY 
THEY ARE CONTRACTUALLY AND I
22:41:50  CONTRACTUAL AND I WOULD 
DEFER TO
22:41:54  STAFF ITSELF.
BUT WE WOULD WANT TO
22:41:57  WORK WITHIN 
THOSE CONFINES.
WE HAVE
22:42:00  A MOTION TO REJECT IT 
WITH THE WAY IT
22:42:03  STANDS AND GO 
BACK WITH SUGGESTIONS.
I WOULD
22:42:06  LIKE TO CHECKER WITH 
PARTIES WE HAVE HERE
22:42:10 , NOT 
INCLUDING OHLONE, IF THERE'S 
ENOUGH FEEDBACK
22:42:13  I'M SURE THERE 
IS ACTUALLY FROM THE COUNCIL 
THIS EVENING
22:42:16  TO EAST BAY 
REGIONAL PARKS AS WELL AS TO OUR 
STAFF
22:42:20  TEAM, SUZANNE AND JIM AND
22:42:23  
OTHERS, THAT WE COULD PERHAPS BE 
ABLE TO MOVE ON AND
22:42:26  WHAT WOULD 
BE THE TIME FRAME AND THE SCOPE 
AT WHICH
22:42:29  WE WERE TO GET THIS 
TOGETHER
22:42:33 ?
22:42:38 
>> JUST TO CLARIFY MY MOTION, WE 
WOULD GO BACK TO THE
22:42:41  MONTH TO 
MONTH CURRENT LEASE AGREEMENT
22:42:44 , 
BEFORE WE BRING EVERYBODY BACK 
TO THE TABLE FOR
22:42:48  THE FOR THE 
LEASE
22:42:51  AGREEMENT, IS THAT 
CORRECT?
>> Councilmember Cox:   YES.

22:42:54 >> Councilmember Keng:   I WOULD 
SECOND THAT.
>> AND
22:42:57  SUZANNE DO YOU FEEL THAT 
YOU HAVE CLARITY ON
22:43:00  THE  
NEGOTIATING TERMS?
22:43:03 
>> Mayor Mei:   WHAT I WAS 
ASKING FOR
22:43:06 .
>> I THINK IT WILL TAKE US A 
WHILE TO WORK
22:43:10  THROUGH SOME OF 
THESE ITEMS WITH EAST BAY 
REGIONAL PARKS BECAUSE SOME
22:43:13  OF 
THEM WILL BE ACCEPTABLE
22:43:16  AND SOME 
OF THEM WON'T BE AS
22:43:18  ANY 
NEGOTIATING ITEM WOULD BE DUE TO 
FURTHER DISCUSSION.

22:43:22 I CAN'T SPEAK TO WHICH ONES 
WOULD BE CLEAR BUT I UNDERSTAND 
WHAT
22:43:25  THE DIRECTION IS FROM 
COUNCIL FROM YOUR DIRECTION TO 
ME
22:43:28  AT THIS POINT.
22:43:31 
>> Mayor Mei:   OKAY, AND IS 
THERE ANYTHING THAT WE SHOULD BE
22:43:35  
CONCERNED OF ON BOTH SIDES?
JIM JUST TO
22:43:38  CLARIFY WE DO THINK 
IT'S IN GOOD SPIRIT THAT WE 
OFFER THESE
22:43:41  COMMENTS THAT WE ARE 
TRYING TO BALANCE.
WE
22:43:45  ABSOLUTELY APPRECIATE ALL THE 
PARTNERSHIP WE'VE HAD IN TERMS 
OF TRYING
22:43:48  TO OFFER THESE 
AMENITIES TO OUR COMMUNITY 
BECAUSE WE
22:43:51  HAVE GOOD 
PARTNERSHIPS WITH DUM
22:44:00  DUMBARTON 
QUARRY
22:44:03 .
JUST TO CLARIFY, I KNOW SOME 
SPEAKERS MENTIONED
22:44:06  TONIGHT FROM 
MY PERSPECTIVE AND WHAT I'VE 
HEARD FROM THE COUNCIL IT
22:44:09  
DOESN'T SOUND LIKE WE'RE JUST 
TRYING TO ADDRESS ONE PART OF 

22:44:12 THE COMMUNITY'S INTERESTS, WE'RE 
TRYING TO BALANCE IT WITH ALL IN 
TERMS
22:44:16  OF BOTH HAVING 
ACCESSIBILITY TO THESE AMENITIES 
IN OUR
22:44:19  COMMUNITY BUT ALSO BEING 
GOOD NEIGHBORS.
AND SO
22:44:22  HOPEFULLY IT IS SOMETHING 
THAT WHEN WE WORK WITH OHLONE
22:44:24  
PROGRAMS IT'S SOMETHING THAT 
PEOPLE UNDERSTAND AND I'VE 

22:44:27 SUGGESTED THIS IN THE PAST WITH 
THE PARKING THAT WE GIVE IT A
22:44:31  
SCHOLARSHIP FOR THE STUDENTS AND 
PEOPLE WOULD BE MORE AMEN
22:44:34 ABLE TO 
PAY FOR THE FEE IF THEY COULD 
UNDERSTAND WHERE
22:44:37  THE FUND'S 
GOING.
JIM DO YOU THINK YOU'VE GOTTEN
22:44:40  
SOME CLEAR GUIDANCE AT LEAST 
FROM ALL OF US FROM OUR
22:44:44  COMMENTS 
TONIGHT?
>> MAYOR MEI, I THINK THE
22:44:47  
COUNCIL HAS BEEN PRETTY CLEAR.
ONE THING I'D
22:44:50  LIKE TO SAY A 
COUPLE OF WORDS IF I MAY.
>> Mayor Mei:  
22:44:53  YES, OF COURSE.
>> ONE THING IN
22:44:56  MY 35-PLUS YEARS 
OF WORKING IN
22:44:59  REGIONAL PARKS, I 
CAN TELL YOU
22:45:03  THAT THE STANFORD 
AVENUE OF AVENUE IS ONLY
22:45:06  IS ONLY
22:45:09  ONE OF TWO 
LOCATIONS WHERE I AND MY AGENCY
22:45:12  
HAVE SPENT SO MANY TIME AND 
EFFORT
22:45:16  TO AMELIORATE IMPACTS
22:45:21  FOR 
RESIDENTS, THAT WE SPENT SO MUCH
22:45:24  
TIME AND EFFORT.
I KNOW ANOTHER ISSUE THAT IS 

22:45:28 IMPORTANT, I'M NOT SPEAKING FOR 
BOARD MEMBERS
22:45:31  BUT EQUITY OF 
ACCESS.
THAT IS SOMETHING OUR BOARD 

22:45:34 REALLY FOCUSES ON PROVIDING 
EQUITABLE ACCESS
22:45:37  TO REGIONAL 
PARKS.
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT FEES,
22:45:40  THAT'S 
GOING TO BE A CONCERN.
BECAUSE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE 

22:45:44 THAT ALL MEMBERS OF OUR 
COMMUNITY HAVE EQUITABLE ACCESS 
TO REENL
22:45:47  PARKS.
SO THAT'S A
22:45:51  CONCERN IN THE 
DISCUSSION OF FEE
22:45:55  AND YOU KNOW I 
REALLY WANT TO EMPHASIZE ONE 
MORE
22:45:58  TIME THAT THERE IS A LOT
22:46:01  OF 
COMMENTS THAT THE PARK DISTRICT 
HAS BEEN UNRESPONSIVE
22:46:04  TO THE 
CONCERNS OF NEIGHBORS.
I WOULD HAVE TO
22:46:07  SAY, TO REJECT 
THAT IDEA THAT WE HAVE
22:46:10  DONE 
QUITE A BIT OF WORK WITH THE 
CITY,
22:46:14  WITH OHLONE COLLEGE, 
TRYING TO GET THE COLLEGE TO
22:46:17  
ENGAGE ON THIS ISSUE AS A 
COMMUNITY MEMBER AND WE'RE 

22:46:20 WILLING TO CONTINUE TO DO THAT 
AND MAYBE WITH THE CHANGE OF 
LEADERSHIP
22:46:23  AT THE COLLEGE MAYBE 
THERE'S GOING TO BE MORE 
TRACTION ON THAT
22:46:27  PERSPECTIVE OF 
THE COLLEGE BEING A PART OF THE 
COMMUNITY AND
22:46:30  HELPING TO MANAGE 
THIS ISSUE.
I HOPE THAT OCCURS
22:46:33 .
AND I'M CERTAINLY WILLING TO 
STEP RIGHT IN THERE.
22:46:36 
LIKE I SAID I HAVEN'T MET 
DR. BISHOP
22:46:40  BUT I'M WILLING TO 
TAKE THAT ON AND WORK WITH THE 
CITY
22:46:43  TO HOPEFULLY ADDRESS SOME 
OF THOSE ISSUES.
I'M STILL
22:46:47  IN THE GAME AND WE'LL 
STILL BE THERE BUT I WANTED TO 
EXPRESS
22:46:50  A COUPLE OF THOSE 
CONCERNS THAT CERTAINLY THE PARK 
DISTRICT
22:46:53  HAS STEPPED UP TO HELP 
WITH SOME OF THESE ISSUES.
THE SITUATION
22:46:57  AT MISSION PEAK 
ESPECIALLY AT STANFORD IS
22:47:00  UNIQUE 
BUT IT'S NOT UNIQUE ANYMORE 
AFTER THAT
22:47:03  PANDEMIC.
WE ARE STRUGGLING
22:47:06  WITH THESE 
DISTRICTS, AND AT MOST
22:47:10  PARK 
DISTRICTS THEY'RE STRUGGLING 
WITH INCREASED VISITATION
22:47:13 .
I DO HAVE THE COMMENTS AND I'M 
SURE SUZANNE AND
22:47:16  I WILL CHECK IN 
AFTER THIS MEETING TO COMPARE 
NOTES AND
22:47:19  WE'LL TAKE IT FROM 
THERE.
>> Mayor Mei:   OKAY GREAT I SAY
22:47:22  
WE HAVE A MOTION AND SECOND.
I ALSO WANT TO REALLY QUICKLY 

22:47:25 NOTE WE HAVE A CHANGE IN OUR 
CITY LEADERSHIP, WE HAVE A 
CHANGE
22:47:29  IN THE EAST BAY REGIONAL 
PARK LEADERSHIP, WE HAVE
22:47:32  A 
CHANGE IN HOME.
22:47:35 
MAYBE THIS CHANGE CAN AFFORD US 
BETTER RESULT
22:47:38  AND ONE THAT WILL 
MEET OUR NEEDS.
22:47:41 
AMEN.
A MOTION AND SECOND, I'M
22:47:45  NOT 
QUOTING CONFUCIO
22:47:48 US TONIGHT BUT 
HE SAYS
22:47:51  THIS IS GETTING LONG 
HERE.
22:47:54 
>> MAYOR I MUST HAVE MISSED WHO 
SECONDED
22:47:57 .
>> Mayor Mei: ORIGINALLY I 
SECONDED IT
22:48:02 .
ANYONE ELSE, I'M FINE, 
ORIGINALLY WANTED TO GET
22:48:04  IT 
MOVED.
>> The Clerk:   COUNCILMEMBER 

22:48:07 COX.
AYE.
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN, AYE
22:48:11 .
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, AYE.
COUNCILMEMBER JONES,
22:48:14  AYE.
COUNCILMEMBER KENG, AYE
22:48:18 .
VICE MAYOR SHAO, AYE.
22:48:21 
MAYOR MEI.
>> Mayor Mei:   AYE SO THE
22:48:24  
MOTION PASSES UNANIMOUSLY.
AND AT THIS TIME
22:48:28 , I DIDN'T 
APOLOGIZE BECAUSE
22:48:31  THIS HAS BEEN 
A LONG EVENING AND I DON'T WANT
22:48:34  
TO END JUST ON THIS NOTE.
IT'S BEEN A VERY TOUGH TIME
22:48:37  FOR 
OUR COMMUNITY.
AND THAT I STARTED THIS EVENING 

22:48:40 TALKING ABOUT HOW IMPORTANT IT 
IS THAT WE HONOR THOSE WHO SERVE 
AND
22:48:43  WHETHER IT'S OUR VETERANS 
THAT WE HONOR WITH OUR SERVICE
22:48:46 , 
OR THIS WEEK
22:48:50 , OR THIS PAST WEEK 
WE'VE LOST ONE OF OUR DEAR 
MEMBERS
22:48:53  IN OUR COMMUNITY, AND
22:48:56  
SHE'S SOMEONE WHO DID SPEAK UP 
OFTEN FOR THOSE WHO
22:48:59  NEEDED A 
VOICE, WHETHER IT'S
22:49:02  FOR THOSE 
WHO ARE FACING DIFFERENT 
CHALLENGES AND SHE PROVIDED
22:49:06  OVER 
30 YEARS OF SERVICE AND I'M 
SPEAKING ABOUT
22:49:10  OUR ALAMEDA 
COUNTY SUPERVISOR
22:49:18  SUPERVISOR WILMA CHAN WHO
22:49:21  
UNFORTUNATELY PASSED THIS WEEK 
IN AN ACCIDENT.

22:49:24 OUR DEEPEST CONDOLENCES TO
22:49:27  HER 
FAMILY, COLLEAGUES AND FRIENDS.
SHE WAS SOMEBODY WHO
22:49:30  WAS A TRAIL 
BLAZE ARE AS A LEADER IN THE 
COMMUNITY.
22:49:34 
ONE OF OUR FIRST AAPI STATE
22:49:37  
SENATORS AND SUPERVISORS AND HAD 
TO, I
22:49:40  HAVE WORKED WITH HER 
AROUND THE MOST
22:49:43  RECENT PROJECT 
WE WERE WORKING ON WAS WITH
22:49:48  
RECIDIVISM AND EQUITY AND
22:49:51  
PROVIDING OPPORTUNITIES FOR FOOD 
AND INSECURITY AND
22:49:54  ADDRESSING 
THOSE ISSUES.
I JUST WANTED TO SAY AGAIN THAT 

22:49:58 I'M GOING TO PAUSE IN A MOMENT 
OF SILENCE FOR
22:50:01  HER AND I THINK 
IT'S JUST APPROPRIATE THAT WE 
RECOGNIZE AND
22:50:04  HONOR HER FOR HER 
SERVICE.
SO IF YOU DON'T
22:50:08  MIND WE'LL --
>> Councilmember Shao:   MAYOR
22:50:11  
MEI SINCE WE'RE HAVING A MOMENT 
OF SILENCE I WOULD ALSO APPROACH
22:50:14  PROPOSE 
THAT
22:50:17  WE DO THAT ALSO FOR OUR 30
22:50:21  
YEAR -- THREE MONTH OLD JESSICA
22:50:25  
WOO WHO TRAJECTORY CLI LOST HIS 
LIFE
22:50:28  ON LAST WEEKEND.
22:50:32 
>> Mayor Mei:   THAT'S FINE, I 
WAS GOING TO DO IT SEPARATELY
22:50:34 .
>> Councilmember Shao:   LET'S 
DO IT SEPARATELY THEN.

22:50:37 >> Mayor Mei:   IF WE COULD 
PAUSE FOR ONE MOMENT AND I'LL
22:50:40  
EXPLAIN THE OTHER SWAIS A LITTLE 
BIT MORE
22:50:43  SITUATION A 
LITTLE BIT MORE
22:50:47 .
[ MOMENT OF SILENCE ]
>> Mayor Mei:   AND IS A I
22:50:50  WAS 
GOING TO THEN ADDRESS THE OTHER 
ONE WHICH I
22:50:53  THINK IS JUST WHEN 
WE TALK ABOUT THOSE WHO HAVE 
SERVED
22:50:57  AND THOSE WHO DIDN'T HAVE 
A CHANCE TO SERVE BUT THEY SERVE
22:51:00  
AS A REMINDER FOR US IN OUR 
COMMUNITY WE
22:51:04  LOST A YOUNG TO THE 
HER THIS WEEK IN A
22:51:07  VERY TRAGIC 
ACCIDENT
22:51:11  OR SHOOTING.
AND I'D LIKE TO
22:51:14  ASK THE 
COMMUNITY WHOEVER IS LISTENING 
TO
22:51:17  PLEASE HELP THE FAMILY.
THERE IS A
22:51:20  GO FUND ME, THERE IS 
ALSO THE REQUEST FOR PEOPLE TO
22:51:23  
PROVIDE INFORMATION.
I KNOW
22:51:27  THAT IN SPEAKING WITH THE 
MOTHER, I THINK HER BIGGEST
22:51:30  HOPE 
IS TO FIND SOME RESOLUTION BUT 
ALSO, MORE IMPORTANTLY
22:51:34 , TO 
PREVENT THIS TYPE OF TRAGEDY 
FROM HAPPENING
22:51:37  AGAIN TO ANY 
OTHER FAMILY.
22:51:41 
AND I JUST HAVE TO
22:51:44  SAY THAT IT 
IS TRULY HEARTBREAK
22:51:48 ING.
IN TERMS OF TRYING
22:51:51  TO UNDERSTAND 
THE
22:51:55  MAGNITUDE OF THIS TYPE OF 
LOSS FOR ANY FAMILY.
AND SO I'D LIKE TO AGAIN
22:51:58  PAUSE 
FOR ANOTHER SEPARATE MOMENT OF 
SILENCE, IF THAT'S
22:52:01  POSSIBLE.
THANK YOU.

22:52:17 [ MOMENT OF SILENT.]
22:52:21 
>> Mayor Mei:   SO WITH THIS 
DISCUSSION OF HOW
22:52:24  WE SERVE OUR 
COMMUNITIES, I JUST ASK THAT WE 
CONTINUE TO
22:52:27  WORK TOGETHER FOR 
KINDNESS AND FOR SUPPORT FOR
22:52:30  ONE 
ANOTHER BECAUSE IT'S MUCH NEEDED 
IN THIS TIME.

22:52:33 AND WE HOPE THAT YOU ARE ALL 
ABLE TO STAY WELL
22:52:36  BE HEALTHY, 
HELP IN ANY WAY THAT YOU CAN
22:52:40 , 
WHETHER IT'S HONORING OUR 
VETERANS, HONORING
22:52:43  THOSE WHO 
HAVE SERVED OUR COMMUNITIES AS 
WELL AS THOSE WHO
22:52:46  HAVE 
TRAGICALLY BEEN IMPACTED AND 
ANYTHING YOU CAN
22:52:49  DO TO HELP THE 
FAMILIES WOULD BE
22:52:52  GREATLY 
APPRECIATED.
THANK YOU.
