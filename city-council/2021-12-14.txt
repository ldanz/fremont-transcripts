WE'RE VERY FORTUNATE AND LUCKY.

19:20:39 SO AT THIS TIME, I'M GOING TO TURN IT BACK TO ORAL COMMUNICATIONS AND THESE

19:20:48 IF PEOPLE WOULD LIKE TO COMMENT ON THAT.
I SEE LAURA WINTER
19:20:51 .
SO
19:20:54  I'M OPENING UP PUBLIC COMMENT RIGHT NOW.

19:20:57 >> GOOD EVENING.
THIS IS LAURA WINTER, AND I
19:21:00  AM HERE
19:21:04  SPEAKING TONIGHT ON BEHALF OF ALL THE PEOPLE OF FREMONT WHO PARTICIPATED
19:21:08  IN THE CENTERVILLE COMPLETE STREETS
19:21:11  SURVEY THAT WAS OFFERED BY THE CITY ASKING OUR OPINION
19:21:15 , WHAT WE THOUGHT OF
19:21:18  FREMONT BOULEVARD THROUGH CENTERVILLE
19:21:24 .
IT ENDED AT THE END OF SEPTEMBER AND WE STILL HAVE NOT SEEN THE RESULTS 
19:21:27 PUBLISHED.

19:21:31 YOU KNOW, WE'RE LOOKING FOR IT AND WANT
19:21:34  TO HAVE ALL THIS PUBLISHED.
IT'S PART OF OPEN CITY
19:21:37  HALL, IT'S PART OF COMMUNICATING WITH
19:21:40  EVERYBODY, AND REALLY IF YOU LOOK AT
19:21:43  PAST SURVEYS, THE MOBILITY TASK
19:21:48  FORCE, THE TREES, THE BIKES,
19:21:51  THE TRAILS, ALL THOSE WERE PUBLISHED IN FULL.
EVEN LAST WEEK'S
19:21:54  REDISTRICTING PARTICIPANTS, IT WAS
19:21:57  ALL  PUBLISHED, AND YET THE CENTERVILLE COMPLETE STREETS
19:22:01  SURVEY HAS NOT BEEN PUBLISHED
19:22:04  AT ALL.
I'VE SPOKEN TO TWO SENIOR STAFF MEMBER
19:22:08 S IN ENG
19:22:11  ENGINEERING, AND EACH OF THEM IMPLIED THAT THE
19:22:14  REASON THAT IT'S NOT UP IS BECAUSE THE CITY DID NOT GET THE ANSWERS THEY WANT
19:22:18 ED.
AND THAT'S JUST WRONG.

19:22:23 THAT'S UNETHICAL.
AND IT REALLY, YOU KNOW -- IT WAS
19:22:26  THE CITY THAT ASKED US FOR
19:22:29  OUR OPINION, AND SO THE CITY SHOULD BE PUBLISHING
19:22:33  THE RESULTS OF THE QUESTIONS AND ALL THE COMMENTS, JUST LIKE THE
19:22:37  OTHER -- YOU KNOW, THE
19:22:40  OTHER SURVEYS THAT HAVE BEEN TAKEN.
LET US KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.

19:22:46 THIS IS NOT JUST ME, THIS IS ALSO MY NEIGHBORS
19:22:49 , OTHER PEOPLE THAT I KNOW, IT'S ON BEHALF OF STEVE
19:22:53  AND JILL AND KAREN
19:22:57 ,  KRISHNAN, JANICE, MARY, BOB
19:23:00 , WICKER, OLIVIA, MEGAN,
19:23:03  ROCKY, BRUCE, JASON, A
19:23:08 NIQUETTE AND  MANY, MANY MORE WHO
19:23:11  LIVE HERE IN CENTERVILLE WHO LIVE IN THE CITY OF FREMONT.

19:23:14 AND AGAIN, THE CITY ASKED FOR AN
19:23:17  OPINION, WE ASK THAT THEY PLEASE PUBLISH WHAT WE SAID.

19:23:21 WE'RE ASKING THAT THE CITY DO THE CORRECT
19:23:24  THING, PUBLISH THE RESULTS IN THE COMMENTS OF THE
19:23:27  SURVEY THAT THEY ASKED US TO PARTICIPATE IN.
IT'S TRULY
19:23:30  THE ETHICAL THING TO DO.
THANK YOU.

19:23:37 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
I WILL NOT COMMENT OTHER THAN I WILL SAY
19:23:41  FOR MYSELF THAT I THINK I'M SURE OUR COUNCIL WOULD AGREE THAT WE WANT TO SEE
19:23:44  THE RESULTS OF THE SURVEYS WHEN WE PUBLISH THEM.

19:23:48 SO BEYOND THAT, I WILL NOT MAKE ANY
19:23:51  OTHER COMMENTS ON THAT BECAUSE IT'S NOT AGENDIZED.
BUT I WILL FOLLOW UP WITH
19:23:54  OUR STAFF.

19:23:58 THERE ARE NO OTHER PUBLIC SPEAKERS AT THIS TIME, SO I'M
19:24:02  GOING TO CLOSE PUBLIC COMMENT.

19:24:05 AND I WILL
19:24:08  BRING IT BACK TO THE ITEMS PULLED AND REMOVED FROM THE CONSENT CALENDAR
19:24:11 .
AGAIN, I'M GOING TO PULL UP EACH OF THE CONSENT CALENDAR
19:24:14  ITEMS.
THE FIRST
19:24:18  ONE BEING 2C.
AND I BELIEVE
19:24:21  THAT'S BLAIR BEEKMAN THAT PULLED THAT ITEM.
SO MR. BEEKMAN, ON
19:24:25  ITEM 2C, TO
19:24:28  CONSIDER AB
19:24:31 361, CONSIDER MAKING FINDINGS TO ALLOW CITY COUNCIL AND THE
19:24:35  LEGISLATIVE BODIES PURSUANT TO
19:24:38  VIDEO CONFERENCE QUESTIONS FOR AB
19:24:41 361.
SO MR. BEEKMAN, ON THIS COMMENT ITEM?
>> 
19:24:44 HI.
CAN YOU HEAR ME?
>> Mayor Mei: YES.

19:24:47 >> THANK YOU.
I HAVE OFFERED
19:24:50  SOME PRETTY GRIM IDEAS, WELL, LET ME
19:24:53  START OVER HERE.
I'LL END WITH THAT.
ALAMEDA
19:24:57  COUNTY, WITH A VERY STRONG DEMOCRATIC PARTY BASE, DOES NOT
19:25:00  YET HAVE A VACCINE MANDATE FOR ITS LOCAL GOVERNMENT WORKERS.

19:25:04 WHAT DO YOU THINK IS THIS LOGIC AND REASONING?
COMPARED
19:25:07  TO ENLIGHTENED IDEAS LIKE SANTA CLARA
19:25:10  COUNTY, WHO ARE HAVE A
19:25:13  VACCINE MANDATE PROCESS FOR THE GOVERNMENT STAFF AT THIS
19:25:18  POINT.
I HOPE THAT WE CAN WORK TO
19:25:21  RESPECT AND ALLOW GOOD FORGIVENESS PLANS FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT WORKERS
19:25:24  AND PEOPLE WHO WILL STILL FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE WITH TAKING THE VACCINE
19:25:28 , TO CONTINUE TO LEARN HOW TO OPENLY AND
19:25:31  CREATIVELY TALK ABOUT THE SCIENCE AND NANOTECHNOLOGY OF THE VACCINE PROCESS
19:25:35 , I FEEL IT IS ACTUALLY THE IDEAS OF BETTER COMMUNITY HEALTH AND SAFETY FOR
19:25:38  THIS WINTER POSSIBLY.
IN THE IMPORTANCE OF
19:25:41  COMMUNITY SAFETY, GOOD CONTINUED MASK USE AND GOOD
19:25:44  AIR FILTRATION SYSTEMS AND CONTINUED HAND WASHING CAN BE OF
19:25:48  HELP TOWARDS COMMUNITY HEALTH AND SAFETY,
19:25:51  AS MANY PEOPLE WANT THEIR GOOD HEALTH AND MAY BE WILLING TO VOLUNTARILY
19:25:54  TAKE THE VACCINE, WITH
19:25:57  THE NEW COVID OMICRON VARIANT ARRIVING
19:26:01 , IT MAY NOT BE SO BAD THIS WINTER --
>> Mayor Mei: MY
19:26:04  APOLOGIES,  MR. BEEKMAN, I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND HOW THIS PERTAINS TO
19:26:07  THE ITEM IN QUESTION THAT YOU PULLED.
>> I JUST WANTED
19:26:10  TO TALK ABOUT THE PLANS OF WHAT TO EXPECT OF THE
19:26:13  COVID PROCESS AND STEPS THAT WE NEED TO TAKE AS A
19:26:16  COMMUNITY TO WORK ON A SERIOUS PANDEMIC ISSUE
19:26:18 .
>> Councilmember Jones: THAT'S NOT THIS ITEM.

19:26:22 >> WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
19:26:25  THE EXTENSION OF THE ZOOM PROCESS, CORRECT?

19:26:28 >> Mayor Mei: YES, BUT THAT WOULD PERTAIN TO THE ZOOM --
>> ALL RIGHT, TECHNICALLY
19:26:32  CORRECT, BUT I'M TALKING ABOUT AN OVERALL HEALTH ISSUE THAT I THINK I
19:26:35  SHOULD BE ALLOWED A CERTAIN LATITUDE, BUT I SAID ALL I'VE NEEDED
19:26:38  TO SAY.
THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY.

19:26:41 I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE STAYING WITHIN THE
19:26:44  CONFINES OF THE ITEMS THAT ARE BEING PULLED.
NEXT
19:26:47  IS ITEM 2D.

19:26:51 >> Ms. Gauthier: MAYOR, CAN WE VOTE ON --
>> Mayor Mei: VOTE
19:26:54  ON 2C FIRST.
CAN I GET A MOTION AND A SECOND, PLEASE
19:26:57 ?
>> Councilmember Jones: MOVE TO APPROVE
19:27:00 .
>> Mayor Mei: MOTION BY JONES, SECOND BY SHAO.

19:27:04 PLEASE VOTE, PLEASE.
>> Ms. Gauthier: COUNCILMEMBER COX, AYE.

19:27:08 COUNCILMEMBER SHAO, AYE.
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, AYE.
COUNCILMEMBER
19:27:12  JONES, AYE.
COUNCILMEMBER KENG
19:27:15 , AYE.

19:27:18 .
MAYOR MEI, AYE.

19:27:22  FOR ITEM 2C, AB
19:27:25 361.

19:27:29 TO CONTINUE HOLDING MEETINGS VIA TELECONFERENCE.
NEXT IS
19:27:32  ITEM 2D, CENTERVILLE RAID ROAD CORRIDOR SAFETY
19:27:36  IMPROVEMENT PROJECT.
REGARDING
19:27:39  THE USE OF THE HORNS OR QUIET ZONES BEING PROPOSED.
I KNOW
19:27:42  THAT VICE MAYOR SALWAN IS RECUSING HIMSELF FROM THIS ITEM
19:27:45 .
SPEAKER, PLEASE ?L
19:27:49 ?
BLIER
19:27:52 BLAIR BEEKMAN.
>> THANK YOU, BLAIR BEEKMAN
19:27:55   HERE.
SORRY ABOUT THE LAST ITEM, I TRIED TO
19:27:58  MENTION THE OMNICRON PROCESS AS A WAY OF PLANNING, I WANTED
19:28:02  TO TALK ABOUT PLANNING ISSUES.
SORRY.
FOR THIS ISSUE,
19:28:07  RAILROAD CORRIDOR SAFETY PROJECT, THE
19:28:10  THE CENTERVILLE PROJECT.
YOU GUYS REALLY, REALLY LACKED
19:28:13  WORKING ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY CONCERNS OF THE FUTURE OF THE
19:28:17  NILES CANYON AREA.
IT WAS QUITE A SURPRISE.
I
19:28:21  HOPE THAT IT BEING BACK HERE, YOU SAID YOU WOULD WORK ON ENVIRONMENTAL
19:28:25  CONCERNS BETTER, AND I HOPE YOU'RE
19:28:28  DOING THAT  NOW.
I HOPE THAT'S HAPPENING.
I FEEL
19:28:31  THIS SORT OF PROJECT IS JUST CONNECTED
19:28:34  TO
19:28:39  THE FUTURE OF HIGH-SPEED RAIL IN SOME WAY AND THERE CAN STILL BE
19:28:42  CHOICES ABOUT THE FUTURE OF HIGH-SPEED RAIL FROM THE CENTRAL
19:28:46  VALLEY WILL LOOK AND BE LIKE.
FOR INSTANCE, THERE'S RAILS
19:28:50  GOING FROM LIKE THE DUBLIN AREA INTO THE CENTRAL
19:28:54  VALLEY, IT'S A NEW RAIL SYSTEM.

19:28:57 IS THAT ACTUALLY NECESSARY?
I MEAN, THERE COULD BE WAYS -- WE COULD
19:29:00  BE BUILDING BART TO GO STRAIGHT OUT THERE
19:29:05 , WE COULD BE BUILDING BART FROM RICHMOND TO
19:29:08  TO ANTIOCH
19:29:12  TO SACRAMENTO IN THOSE SORT OF TERMS.
IT WOULD BE
19:29:15  A MUCH MORE EFFICIENT SYSTEM THAN HAVING TO BUILD MULTIPLE
19:29:18  RAIL LINES.
I SIMPLY QUESTION THAT HAPPENING AT THIS TIME
19:29:21 .
AND TO SIMPLY MAKE THAT OPEN HERE, I
19:29:24  HOPE CAN BE OF HELP, BECAUSE I THINK I SEE A REALLY
19:29:28  SIMPLE SYSTEM, HOW WE CAN TALK ABOUT HIGH-SPEED RAIL
19:29:31  AND TO MAKE IT EFFICIENT AND UNDERSTANDABLE IN ITS
19:29:34  BUILDING, BUT YET WE'RE MAKING IT REALLY COMPLICATED
19:29:38  AND DENSE AND  OPAQUE.
AND IT SAD THAT THAT'S HAPPENING
19:29:41  HAPPENING.
BUT YET YOU'RE TRYING TO WORK ON A GOOD PROJECT
19:29:45  HERE, YET THERE WAS ISSUES WITHIN OUR OWN LOCAL AREA
19:29:48  THAT PEOPLE -- THE CENTERVILLE AREA MAY NOT WANT  IT,
19:29:51  THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS OF THE NILES CANYON
19:29:54  AREA REALLY HAS TO BE, YOU KNOW, TALKED ABOUT,
19:29:57  OPENLY.
AND IT HAS TO BE OF CONCERN TO YOURSELVES.

19:30:01 YOU GUYS BRUSHED IT OFF IN A REALLY
19:30:04  SHOCKING WAY LAST TIME, AND
19:30:07  YOU SHOULD BE -- I SHOULD BE OFFERED FACTS ABOUT, YOU KNOW
19:30:10 , WE SHOULD HAVE AT THE MOST FIVE TRAINS A WEEK
19:30:13 , 10 TRAINS A WEEK.

19:30:17 SOMETHING ABOUT THOSE NUMBERS.
I HOPE YOU CAN
19:30:20  LEARN TO, YOU KNOW, WORK IN THOSE SORT OF TERMS OF WHAT
19:30:23  TO EXPECT ON HOW MANY TRAINS WILL BE TRAVELING THROUGH
19:30:26  THERE IN THE FUTURE.
IT SHOULD BE A SMALL NUMBER.

19:30:29 THE ABSOLUTE MINIMUM.
AND YOU GUYS WEREN'T HE
19:30:33  READY TO TALK IN THOSE TERMS AND YOU HAVE TO LEARN TO DO THAT.
I THINK
19:30:36  IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT.
JUST FOR
19:30:39  DECENCY, JUST FOR, YOU KNOW, GOOD PRACTICES
19:30:42 .

19:30:45 SO GOOD LUCK HOW WE CAN TALK ABOUT THIS PROJECT BETTER.
THANK YOU.

19:30:49 >> Mayor Mei: JUST TO CLARIFY, I JUST WANT TO MENTION THAT THIS CORRIDOR DOES NOT
19:30:52  HAVE ANY HIGH-SPEED RAIL, AND THAT THIS IS
19:30:55  TO DISCUSS ESTABLISHING QUIET ZONES, WHICH WE HAVE ESTABLISHED
19:30:59  IN OTHER LOCATIONS.
SO I JUST WANTED TO NOTE THAT.
AND I
19:31:02  SEE MISS WINTER, YOU HAVE RAISED YOUR HAND ON THIS
19:31:05  ITEM, SO PLEASE.
>> YES, GOOD
19:31:08  EVENING.
SINCE I'M ALREADY HERE, I THOUGHT I MIGHT AS WELL SPEAK ON THIS
19:31:11  ITEM AS WELL.
JUST A REAL QUICK, AGAIN, IT'S PART OF THE
19:31:15  COMMUNICATIONS  THING.
I DON'T QUITE KNOW
19:31:19  WHAT IT'S TALKING ABOUT MAKING IMPROVEMENTS TO THE INTERSECTIONS
19:31:22  OR THE ROAD AT THE RAILROAD TRACKS OR RAIL
19:31:25  RAILROAD TRACKS AT THE ROADS IN ORDER TO CREATE THESE
19:31:29  QUIET ZONES.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.
I KNOW THAT YOU GUYS
19:31:32  WORKED ON IT AND I THINK IN NILES,
19:31:35  BUT AGAIN, IT WOULD BE GREAT IF SOMEWHERE ON THE WEBSITE
19:31:38 , WE COULD SEE DIAGRAMS
19:31:42  OR SOMETHING DESCRIBING WHAT ACTUALLY IS GOING TO
19:31:45  HAPPEN AT THESE INTERSECTIONS IN ORDER TO MAKE
19:31:49  THE -- TO CREATE THE QUIET ZONE
19:31:52  ZONES.
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO THE ROADS, WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO
19:31:56  THE -- JUST EVERYTHING IN THE
19:31:59  VICINITY OF EACH OF THESE QUIET ZONES AND GIVE
19:32:02  US, I THINK PRETTY
19:32:05  DETAILED DESCRIPTIONS AND DRAWINGS
19:32:08  OF WHAT IS ACTUALLY GOING TO HAPPEN AND PREFERABLY
19:32:11  PREFERABLY -- CERTAINLY PREFERABLY BEFORE IT HAPPENS.
JUST SO THAT WE CAN BE
19:32:15  PREPARED AND NOT BE SURPRISED.

19:32:18 IT SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD IDEA, BUT HOW IS IT GOING TO IMPACT US IN
19:32:21  OTHER WAYS?
SO THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: SO
19:32:24  I JUST WANTED TO NOTE THAT IS PART OF OUR -- WE HAVE A PAGE
19:32:27  ON OUR WEBSITE CALLED QUIET ZONES, AND I APOLOGIZE, I HAVE
19:32:30  THE LINK BUT I DON'T SEE THE ABILITY FOR ME TO
19:32:34  POST IT IN THE CHAT OR ANYTHING.
BUT I'D BE
19:32:37  HAPPY TO HAVE THAT SENT AND WE SHOULD GO AHEAD AND JUST PROVIDE THAT
19:32:40 .
I'M SURE STAFF CAN MAKE SURE -- IT ALREADY
19:32:43  OUT THERE FOR CENTERVILLE, AND IT DOES HAVE DETAILED DIAGRAMS THAT
19:32:47  I'M LOOKING AT RIGHT NOW.
SO I APOLOGIZE.
IT IS
19:32:50  AT FREMONT.GOV

19:32:57  FREMONT.GOV/3883/CENTERVILLE-RAI LROAD

IT HAS A PICTURE OF
19:33:04  ONE OF THE GUIDELINES IN TERMS OF CENTERVILLE TO CLARK
19:33:07  RAILROAD SAFETY IMPROVEMENT PROJECT, AS WELL AS THE PRELIMINARY
19:33:10  DATES AND TIME.
THE PROJECT FUNDING WAS APPROVED
19:33:13  AT THE BEGINNING OF OUR CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM AS PART OF
19:33:16  JUNE OF 2021.
AND IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS ON THIS
19:33:20 , THE STAFF CONTACT IS
19:33:23  JEANNE SUYEI

19:33:32 494-4728, BUT WE'LL MAKE SURE THAT'S PUBLISHED SO PEOPLE CAN SEE IT
19:33:35 .
IT'S ALREADY ON OUR WEBSITE, BUT THANK YOU FOR CLARIFYING AND  ASKING
19:33:39  THAT QUESTION.
QUESTION FROM COUNCILMEMBER SHAO.

19:33:44 >> Councilmember Shao: MAYOR  MEI, I'D JUST LIKE TO MAKE A MOTION FOR THIS ITEM.

19:33:48 >> Mayor Mei: SURE.

19:34:31 >> Councilmember Jones: MADAME MAYOR?
IF WE COULD JUST CLARIFY ONCE AGAIN THAT
19:34:34  THE COMMENTS NEED TO BE DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE ITEM.

19:34:38 >> Mayor Mei: YES, PLEASE.
I APOLOGIZE, I'VE LOST THAT PAGE.

19:34:42 I ACCIDENTALLY CLOSED IT.
SO ITEM 2E.

19:34:51 MS. GAUTHIER --
>> Ms. Gauthier: THE CITYWIDE
19:34:55  CONCRETE REPAIRS AND INTERSECTION RAMPS PROJECT.

19:34:58 AND MR. BEEKMAN IS SPEAKING ON THIS ITEM.
>> Mayor Mei: YES.

19:35:03 >> HI, BLAIR BEEKMAN HERE.
YOU KNOW, IN
19:35:06  REREADING THE LAST ITEM, I AM IN AGREEMENT
19:35:09  THAT I WENT A LITTLE OFF TOPIC ON THAT SUBJECT.
IT
19:35:13  WAS A LITTLE BIT MORE VAGUE
19:35:16  AT THIS POINT.
I WILL TRY TO GET IN LINE HERE
19:35:19 .
SO
19:35:22  THANKS FOR YOUR PATIENCE WITH MYSELF
19:35:25 .
HOPEFULLY I OFFERED INTERESTING THINGS
19:35:29  FOR YOURSELVES TO CONSIDER.
SORRY, JUST A LITTLE BIT OUT OF
19:35:32  BOUNDS TONIGHT.
FOR THIS ITEM, I WANTED TO MENTION THAT THE CITY OF
19:35:35  SAN JOSÉ IS ALSO WORKING
19:35:38  ON THESE VERY ISSUES.
THEY HAVE A BOND
19:35:41  ISSUE PROGRAM CALLED MEASURE T, AND THEY'RE DO
19:35:44  DOING THESE EXACT SAME THINGS.
IT COULD BE CONSIDER
19:35:48 ED, IN MY FEELING, UNDER IDEAS OF
19:35:51  EARTHQUAKE RETROFIT FOR BRIDGES AND
19:35:55  OVERPASSES AND THINGS LIKE THAT.
AND I WANT TO TAKE THIS TIME
19:35:58  TO APOLOGIZE FOR MYSELF IN THE PAST YEAR
19:36:02  ABOUT, YOU KNOW, I'VE  TALKED ABOUT EARTHQUAKE POSSIBLE SCENARIO
19:36:06 S IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS.
I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S CORRECT IN MY
19:36:10  THINKING.
I MAY BE WRONG.
AND I NEEDED TO SAY THAT AT THIS TIME 
19:36:14 TO JUST APOLOGIZE AND JUST -- I THINK IN THE
19:36:17  NEXT  YEAR, I'M GOING TO TRY TO LEARN TO TAKE A BIT MORE POSITIVE
19:36:20  APPROACH.
YOU KNOW HOW I FEEL AND I THINK
19:36:25  I'VE GIVEN YOURSELVES PLENTY OF WARNING AND WHAT TO
19:36:28  EXPECT AND HOW YOU CAN THINK OF IT, AND THAT SHOULD ALLOW YOURSELVES TO HAVE A
19:36:31  GOOD WAY TO BE THINKING ABOUT THE NEXT FEW YEARS.
>> Mayor Mei: SO
19:36:34  MR. BEEKMAN, I APOLOGIZE, THIS IS PERTAINING
19:36:37  TO REPAIRS FOR CONCRETE ON  SIDEWALKS AND
19:36:41  CURBS FOR TREES
19:36:44 .
>> OH, I'M JUST -- I'M OFF  AGAIN.
IT IS NOT
19:36:48  FOR OVERRAMP
19:36:51 S, OVERPASSES --
>> Mayor Mei: INTERSECTIONS
19:36:53  THAT ARE NEAR THE SCHOOLS FOR SAFE ROUTES TO SCHOOLS.
>> OH, BOY.

19:36:56 I'M REALLY SORRY ABOUT THAT.
I'M REALLY OFF TONIGHT.
I'M VERY, VERY SORRY
19:37:00 .
THANK YOU FOR EXPLAINING.
BOY
19:37:03 , I'VE EXPLAINED CITY OF SAN JOSÉ
19:37:06  SAN JOSÉ AND I'VE EXPLAINED MY OWN LIFE STORY
19:37:09  TO THE HILT.
IF I COULD FINISH WITH 56 SECONDS, I CAN TALK ABOUT THE
19:37:13  IMPORTANCE OF THESE SORT OF PROJECTS AND THE NEED
19:37:16  OF GOOD OPEN PUBLIC POLICIES AND ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THE TECHNOLOGY
19:37:20  THAT WILL POSSIBLY BE USED FOR THESE INTERSECTIONS NEAR SCHOOL
19:37:24 S, AND IT'S A GREAT WAY TO OFFER THIS
19:37:27  TO KIDS WHO WILL BE GOING TO SCHOOL
19:37:30  TO SHARE THESE SORT OF OPEN PUBLIC
19:37:36   POLICIES WITH TECHNOLOGY THAT I THINK THEY WOULD BE INTERESTED IN
19:37:40  AS THEY'RE GOING TO SCHOOL TO LEARN WHAT THEIR FUTURE
19:37:43  IS AND SEEING THE TECHNOLOGY AROUND THEM, HOW THEY CAN ASK YOU
19:37:47 , ASK GOVERNMENT QUESTIONS EASIER
19:37:51 , MORE DIRECT AND MORE ORGANIZED, WHAT EXACTLY IS THE TECHNOLOGY
19:37:54  ABOUT.
IT'S DATA COLLECTION
19:37:57  COLLECTION POTENTIAL, AND IT'S
19:38:00  GOOD SUBJECT MATTER THAT WILL BE A PART OF THE CONCRETE
19:38:03  REPAIRS AROUND SCHOOLS, I THINK.
THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:38:06 JUST TO CLARIFY, THIS IS FOR PROJECT FUNDING FOR
19:38:09  CONCRETE REPAIR CURB AND GUTTER REPAIRS NEAR THE
19:38:12  SCHOOL, SO TECHNOLOGY, IN TERMS OF THE
19:38:15  OPEN PROCESS IS THAT WE HAVE AN OPEN BID PROCESS
19:38:18  PROCESS.
BUT THERE IS PROBABLY
19:38:21  NOT ADDITIONAL TECHNOLOGY FOR THE CURBS
19:38:25  AND GUTTERS.
CAN I GET A MOTION AND A SECOND?

19:38:28 >> Councilmember Cox: SO MOVE.

19:38:32 >> Councilmember Jones: SECOND.
>> Mayor Mei: ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE.
>> Ms. Gauthier: 
19:38:35 YES, MADAME MAYOR.

NEXT IS ITEM
19:39:00  2J AS IN JOHN.

19:39:04 CITY CLERK GAUTHIER,
19:39:08   MS. GAUTHIER, COULD YOU
19:39:11  PLEASE TELL ME THE ITEM AGAIN?

19:39:14 >> Ms. Gauthier: THIS IS AUTHORIZING THE CITY MANAGER OR HER DESIGNEE
19:39:17  TO ENTER INTO A MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING WITH THE FREMONT UNIFIED SCHOOL
19:39:20  DISTRICT TO RE-ESTABLISH THE SCHOOL RESOURCE OFFICER
19:39:24  PROGRAM.

19:39:29 MR. BEEKMAN RAISED HIS HAND TO SPEAK ON THIS.
>> HI.

19:39:32 THANK YOU.
I HAVEN'T DONE TOO GREAT TODAY.
THANKS A LOT
19:39:35  FOR YOUR PATIENCE WITH MYSELF.

19:39:41 WHEELCHAIR ACCESS ISSUES
19:39:45 , THAT'S IMPORTANT FOUR EV SES AS CITY
19:39:48  GOVERNMENT TO BE AWARE OF TO AVOID PEOPLE SUING SMALL BUSINESSES
19:39:51  AND STUFF IN THE FUTURE, TO DEVELOP
19:39:55  --
>> City Mgr. Shackelford: MR. BE EKMAN, IS THERE A COMMENT ON THIS 
19:39:58 ITEM?
>> VERY TRUE.
I'LL STOP NOW, JUST SO YOU KNOW.

19:40:01 THANKS AGAIN FOR YOUR PATIENCE.
WITH THE S
19:40:04 RO PROGRAM, WE ARE REALLY, REALLY TALKING ABOUT
19:40:07  LAW ENFORCEMENT ISSUES AT THIS TIME, AND HOW TO DEAL
19:40:11  WITH SMASH AND GRABS AND, YOU KNOW, LOOT
19:40:15 ING AND SERIOUS ISSUES,
19:40:18 S.
I WORK FROM THE END OF TECHNOLOGY.
I
19:40:21  DON'T THINK WE JUST DIVE INTO LAW ENFORCEMENT CONCERNS.
IT HAS TO
19:40:24  BE A WELL-ROUNDED APPROACH.
IT HAS TO BE
19:40:28  A COMBINATION OF THINGS.
I THINK THE
19:40:31  SRO PROGRAM, I
19:40:35  QUESTION ITS RETURN.
I THINK WE
19:40:38  HAD SOME REALLY IMPORTANT GOALS FOR IT.

19:40:41 I THINK THE ORIGINAL SRO TASK FORCE
19:40:44 , IF IT WAS REALLY SET OUT TO HAVE IT AS A PUBLIC MEETING
19:40:48  PROCESS, YOU KNOW, AFTER THE SRO
19:40:51  SRO -- THE SRO TASK FORCE WANTED TO CREATE A PUBLIC MEETING PROCESS
19:40:55 , A COMMISSION PROCESS TO WORK ON THESE SORT
19:40:58  OF ISSUES, THAT WOULD BE A FULL
19:41:01  COMMUNITY EFFORT, WHERE ALL PARTS OF THE COMMUNITY
19:41:04  WOULD GATHER ON A WEDNESDAY
19:41:07  NIGHT AND TALK ABOUT
19:41:11  ISSUES OF HEALTH AND PUBLIC SAFETY.

19:41:14 AND TO CONTINUOUSLY DO THAT WEEK AFTER WEEK, THAT'S THE SORE
19:41:18  SORT OF THINGS, THAT'S THE SORT OF COMMUNITY FUTURE
19:41:21  THAT'S NEEDED THAT EVENTUALLY INVITES ALL PARTS OF THE COMMUNITY TO SAY WE'RE NOT GOING TO
19:41:24  BE ACTING AND WORKING IN THESE WAYS ANYMORE.
THAT'S HOW
19:41:27  YOU REDUCE VIOLENCE.

19:41:31 AND REDUCING THE SRO SITUATION IS
19:41:34  AN IMPORTANT PURPOSE.
LET'S
19:41:37  NOT FORGET THAT, THAT WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON THAT
19:41:40  THAT.
I THINK WE REALLY
19:41:43  CAN TURN THE TIDE THAT WE HAVE SUCH IMPORTANT IDEALISM OF WHAT WE CAN
19:41:47  GROW AND BUILD TOWARDS POSITIVE  SUSTAINABILITY
19:41:50  WITH REIMAGINE, WITH EQUITY, WITH HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES
19:41:53  IDEAS, WE HAVE GOT TO PUT THAT FRONT
19:41:56  AND CENTER OF HOW WE TALK ABOUT THINGS, AND NOT SIMPLY
19:42:00  JUST TOSS IT ASIDE AND SAY IT'S TINY CHILDREN
19:42:03  PLAYING, YOU KNOW?
THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT GOOD STUFF.

19:42:07 AND HOW DO WE CONVINCE OTHERS WHO ARE
19:42:10  NOT SO WANTING TO BE A PART OF THAT -- OF
19:42:14  THIS NEW GOOD SYSTEM?
HOW DO
19:42:17  WE DEVELOP THAT DIALOGUE?
IT'S THROUGH THE PUBLIC MEETING
19:42:20  PROCESS, IT'S THROUGH A LOT OF THINGS.

19:42:24 AND OBVIOUSLY THIS STORY IS NOT OVER.

19:42:27 PEACE AND SUSTAINABILITY ARE IMPORTANT CONCEPTS.
WE REALLY
19:42:30  HAVE TO LEARN HOW TO BETTER WORK ON.
THANK YOU.

19:42:35 >> Mayor Mei: SO AGAIN, THIS ITEM IS ITEM 2J
19:42:38 , WHICH IS --
>> Councilmember Cox: I'D LIKE TO SO
19:42:41  MOVE.
>> Councilmember Jones: SECOND.
>> Mayor Mei: AGAIN JUST TO CLARIFY, 
19:42:44 THIS IS TO AUTHORIZE THE CITY MANAGER TO ENTER INTO AN MOU
19:42:47  WITH FUSD.
>> Councilmember Cox: CORRECT.
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY.

19:42:50 MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER COX, SECONDED BY
19:42:54  COUNCILMEMBER JONES.
CAN WE HAVE A ROLL CALL VOTE ON THIS
19:42:57  ITEM, PLEASE.
>> Ms. Gauthier: COUNCILMEMBER COX,
19:43:00  AYE.
COUNCILMEMBER SHAO, AYE.
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN
19:43:04 , NO.
COUNCILMEMBER JONES, AYE
19:43:08 .
COUNCILMEMBER KENG,
19:43:11  AYE.
VICE MAYOR SALWAN, AYE.
MAYOR
19:43:14  MEI, AYE.
>> Mayor Mei: THE MOTION PASSES
19:43:18  WITH 6 AYES AND COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN VOTING
19:43:21  NAY.

19:43:25 NEXT IS -- I THINK THAT WAS THE LAST OF OUR CONSENT CALENDAR ITEMS
19:43:28 .
THAT WAS
19:43:31  PULLED.
WE'LL GO BACK TO OUR REGULARLY SCHEDULED
19:43:34  ITEMS.
WHICH IS ITEM
19:43:38  5A, WHICH IS A DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEE ANNUAL REPORT AND
19:43:41  PROPOSED INCREASE IN FEES, AND WE HAVE OUR
19:43:44  PUBLIC WORKS DIRECTOR, HANS LARSEN, TO PROVIDE SOME
19:43:47  VERBAL COMMENTS AND CLARIFY ANY AMENDED ACTIONS NEEDED BY US
19:43:50 .
WELCOME
19:43:54 , HANS.

19:43:58 >> GOOD EVENING, MAYOR MEI AND MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL.
I JUST WANTED TO
19:44:01  CLARIFY A RECOMMENDATION ON THIS ITEM AND WE
19:44:04  HAD SUBMITTED AN AMENDMENT TO IT.

19:44:08 THE ACTION BEFORE YOU TONIGHT
19:44:11  WAS PROPOSED TO DO TWO THINGS.
SO FIRST OFF IS
19:44:14  TO HAVE YOU APPROVE AN
19:44:17  ANNUAL REPORT THAT WE'RE REQUIRED TO PREPARE
19:44:21  IN COMPLIANCE WITH STATE LAWS THAT
19:44:26  THAT -- FEES THAT WE COLLECT FROM DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEE PROGRAM
19:44:30 S, HOW THOSE FUNDS ARE ALLOCATED
19:44:34  AND WHAT PROJECTS ARE IN CONSTRUCTION, SO INCLUDED
19:44:37  IN THE STAFF REPORT IS THAT ANNUAL REPORT.
YOU'RE REQUIRED TO
19:44:40  HOLD A PUBLIC HEARING IN REGARDS TO THE
19:44:44  APPROVAL OF THAT REPORT.
SO THAT'S THE FIRST ITEM, AND
19:44:47  WE RECOMMEND THAT YOU CONTINUE TO TAKE UP
19:44:50  THAT ITEM AND CONSIDER APPROVAL.
THE
19:44:53  SECOND PART OF THIS, WHICH WE'RE RECOMMENDING TO POSTPONE
19:44:57 , IS A CONSIDERATION OF ADJUSTING OUR
19:45:00  DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEES BEGINNING NEXT FISCAL YEAR
19:45:04  TO ACCOUNT FOR
19:45:07  THE INFLATIONARY INCREASE IN CONSTRUCTION COSTS
19:45:10 .
AND AS COUNCIL WILL RECALL, AS A MATTER
19:45:13  OF PRACTICE, WE ANNUALLY ADJUST OUR FEE
19:45:17 S BASED ON A PUBLISHED CONSTRUCTION COST
19:45:20  INDEX AND THE PURPOSE OF THAT IS SO THAT
19:45:23  THE PURPOSE IN WHICH WE COLLECT THE FEE
19:45:27 S, THE PROJECTS AND IMPROVEMENTS THAT WE PROVIDE THAT
19:45:30  ARE ASSOCIATED WITH IMPACTS FROM NEW DEVELOPMENT
19:45:34  WERE ABLE TO BUILD THOSE PROJECTS AND
19:45:37  ACCOUNT FOR CONSTRUCTION COST INCREASES.
SO AS A
19:45:40  MATTER OF PAST PRACTICE, WE USUALLY
19:45:43  LINKED THE ADJUSTMENT OF THE FEE WITH THE APPROVAL OF THE
19:45:47  ANNUAL REPORT
19:45:50 .
THIS YEAR, WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO SEPARATE THAT BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME
19:45:53  NEW REQUIREMENTS IN TERMS OF OUT
19:45:56 REACH REGARDING FEE INCREASES
19:46:00 , AND IT WAS POINTED OUT TO US, APPRECIATE DENNIS MARTIN
19:46:03  FROM BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION
19:46:07  IDENTIFYING THAT WE HADN'T FULLY COMPLIED WITH THE NEW STATE
19:46:10  LAWS IN TERMS OF  OUTREACH.
SO WE ARE
19:46:13  RECOMMENDING THAT WE POSTPONE THAT
19:46:17  SECOND ACTION TONIGHT, AND WE WILL BRING THAT BACK TO
19:46:20  COUNCIL AND FULLY COMPLY WITH THE OUT
19:46:23 REACH REQUIREMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH A FEE INCREASE.
BE HAPPY TO ANSWER
19:46:26  ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE.
THANK YOU.

19:46:33 >> Mayor Mei: ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE COUNCIL?
I'M HAVING PROBLEMS WITH THE LINK
19:46:37 .
I HAD SEEN THAT EARLIER
19:46:40  TODAY, BUT --
19:46:47  COUNCILMEMBER COX, DO YOU HAVE A COMMENT ON THIS?
BECAUSE THE REPORT IS NOT SOMETHING
19:46:50  I CAN --
>> Councilmember Cox: YEAH, I WANTED TO MAKE SURE,
19:46:54  TONIGHT YOU'RE ASKING US TO APPROVE THE ANNUAL REPORT BUT
19:46:57  NOT APPROVE ANY OTHER STEPS
19:47:00  BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT TO DO THE OUTREACH TO COMPLY WITH THE NEW RULES OR LAWS
19:47:03  THAT HAVE COME ABOUT RECENTLY?

19:47:06 IS THAT WHAT MY UNDERSTANDING  IS?

19:47:10 >> Mr. Larsen: YES, THAT'S CORRECT, JUST TO KIND OF REITERATE, SO WE'RE ASKING YOU TO
19:47:13  APPROVE THE REPORT AND BASICALLY HOW WE'VE USED DEVELOPMENT
19:47:16  IMPACT FEES IN THE PAST FISCAL YEAR, AND
19:47:20  THEN WE'RE RECOMMENDING THAT WE POSTPONE
19:47:23  THE ACTION TO CONSIDER A
19:47:27  INFLATIONARY INCREASE OF FEES THAT
19:47:30  WOULD BEGIN BEGINNING NEXT FISCAL YEAR, WHICH
19:47:33  WOULD START IN JULY OF 2022.

19:47:41 >> Councilmember Cox: OKAY, AND THOSE TYPE OF INFLATIONARY FEES, YOU'RE TYING
19:47:45  IT BACK TO INFLATIONARY COSTS AND THINGS LIKE THAT
19:47:48  THAT YOU'RE ROLLING THAT COST UP INTO?
>> Mr. Larsen: YEAH, SO WHAT
19:47:51  WE'VE DONE AS PAST PRACTICE, THERE IS WITHIN
19:47:54  THE BAY AREA, THERE IS A PUBLISH
19:47:59 ED RATE IN TERMS OF INCREASES
19:48:02  IN CONSTRUCTION COSTS
19:48:05 , SO WE'VE IN THE PAST USED THAT RATE TO
19:48:09  ADJUST OUR DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEE.
SO AGAIN,
19:48:12  THE PURPOSE IS THAT THE
19:48:15  ITEMS THAT WE'RE COLLECTING THE FEES FOR THAT
19:48:19  WE'RE ABLE TO COMPLETE THEM IN CONSTRUCTION AND HAVE
19:48:22  OUR FEES KEEP PACE WITH THE INFLATIONARY COST
19:48:25  INCREASES CONSTRUCTION.
AND AGAIN, IT'S NOT A RATE THAT
19:48:29  WE ESTABLISH, BUT WE USE ONE THAT'S ESTABLISHED FOR
19:48:33  THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA.
>> Councilmember Cox: IT'S SOME SORT
19:48:36  OF GOVERNMENT INDEX THAT THEY KIND OF MAP OUT WHAT THE  KOS ARE
19:48:39  COSTS
19:48:42  ARE, I'M FAMILIAR WITH THAT, AND THOSE THINGS ARE ADJUSTED
19:48:45  EACH YEAR BASED ON THE FORECAST AND LOOKING OUT, SO EACH YEAR,
19:48:49  IT'S ROLLED OUT A NEW NUMBER OR REFLECTS WHAT THE NEW TREND
19:48:53  IS, RIGHT?
WE'RE NOT LOCKED IN FOR THIS
19:48:56  RATE, IT'S JUST ONE YEAR, RIGHT?

19:48:59 >> Mr. Larsen: THAT'S CORRECT, YEAH
19:49:03 , IT'S A PERCENTAGE INCREASE THAT'S APPLIED TO THAT YEAR
19:49:06 , AND INDEX VARIES EVERY YEAR BASED ON
19:49:10  CONSTRUCT COST.
IT'S ACTUALLY
19:49:14  NOT A PROJECTION ANTICIPATED INCREASES, BUT IT REFLECTS
19:49:17  ACTUAL INCREASED COSTS OF
19:49:21  CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS.
>> Councilmember Cox: RIGHT, RIGHT.
BUT RIGHT NOW,
19:49:24  WE'RE IN THE HIGHEST THAT WE'VE EVER SEEN IN HISTORY,
19:49:27  INCLUDING 34% EVEN DOWN
19:49:31  TO FUEL PRICING
19:49:34 , SO THIS IS A INTERESTING
19:49:37  YEAR TO BUILD AND DEVELOP RIGHT NOW, BASED
19:49:40  ON THE NEW NUMBERS.
I'M JUST TRYING TO MAKE SURE
19:49:44  YOU I UNDERSTAND
19:49:47  -- THAT IT'S ROLLED INTO AND THAT IT COULD BE  ADJUSTED BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE
19:49:52  PREDICTED IN 2022 TO 2023, WHICH WOULD BE OUR
19:49:56  FISCAL YEAR OF I GUESS JULY 2023,
19:50:00  THAT IT WOULD BE A DIFFERENT
19:50:03  LOOK TREND GOING ON VERSUS RIGHT NOW, STARTING
19:50:05  SIX MONTHS FROM NOW.
SO OKAY.
THANK YOU.

19:50:14 >> Mayor Mei: COUNCILMEMBER JONES.
>> Councilmember Jones: YES, MADAME MAYOR
19:50:17 .
IF THERE ARE NO OTHER COMMENTS, I WOULD MOVE TO APPROVE WITH
19:50:20  THE CHANGES RECOMMEND BY DIRECTOR LARSEN.

19:50:25 >> Councilmember Cox: SECOND.
>> Mayor Mei: I WAS JUST
19:50:28  GOING TO SAY THAT I'M HAPPY TO APPROVE IT, BUT I'M SEEING
19:50:31  THAT THERE'S PROBLEMS WITH THE LINK ON THE REPORT ON THE WEB
19:50:34  WEBSITE, SO I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT
19:50:38  WE WERE BEING FULLY PUBLIC WITH THAT  TOO.

19:50:41 THE PUBLIC HASN'T BEEN ABLE TO
19:50:44  SEE THE REPORT.
IT WILL BE COMING BACK FOR A SECOND VOTE
19:50:47  ANYWAYS TOO, SO I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE.
>> Vice Mayor Salwan: DO WE NEED
19:50:51  TO OPEN THE PUBLIC HEARING OR --
>> Mayor Mei: YES, I
19:50:54  WAS GOING TO OPEN THE PUBLIC HEARING BUT I DON'T SEE ANY HANDS -- OH,
19:50:58  LISA DANZ HAS HER HAND RAISED.
I'M OPENING
19:51:01  THE PUBLIC COMMENT RIGHT NOW,
19:51:04  FIRST.
>> THANKS.
AND SORRY I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT
19:51:07  THIS AHEAD OF TIME.
I WAS JUST GOING TO
19:51:10  RECOMMEND THAT THE REPORT -- SINCE IT HASN'T BEEN
19:51:13  ACCESSIBLE, MAYBE WE SHOULD DEFER APPROVING IT.
THAT'S
19:51:15  ALL.
THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:51:20 ARE THERE ANY --
>> Councilmember Cox: IS THERE AN I.T. PROBLEM GOING ON
19:51:23  THAT --
>> Mayor Mei: THERE WERE SOME  I.T. PROBLEMS, I KNOW, WITH THE LINK TO
19:51:26  THE MEETING TOO ITSELF, BUT I THINK THAT WAS RESOLVED BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY
19:51:29  WE DO HAVE PUBLIC SPEAKERS TONIGHT.
BUT I WAS
19:51:32  JUST CHECKING ON THAT TOO, BECAUSE I KNOW THERE HAVE BEEN
19:51:36  SOME MINOR I.T. ISSUES.
ANY COMMENTS?

19:51:43 MS. MARGOLIS MADAME MAYOR, I JUST CHECKED THE WEB
19:51:46  WEBSITE AND IT LOOKS LIKE THE STAFF REPORT AND ITS ATTACHMENTS ARE AVAILABLE
19:51:49 .
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY, MAYBE IT'S ME.

19:51:53 >> Councilmember Jones: MADAME MAYOR, THERE HAVE BEEN ISSUES, IT'S ACCESSIBLE
19:51:56  FROM, IT SEEMS LIKE EVERYTHING BUT IPHONES.

19:52:00 >> Mayor Mei: OKAY.
MAYBE THAT'S IT.

19:52:04 BECAUSE IT SAYS THE DOCUMENT APPEARS TO BE CORRUPT AND CANNOT BE
19:52:07  LOADED.
>> Ms. Margolis: IT'S COMING UP NO
19:52:10  PROBLEM FOR ME.
>> City Mgr. Shackelford: I'M ABLE TO ACCESS IT AS WELL
19:52:12 .
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY, GREAT.
THANK YOU.

19:52:16 AS LONG AS IT'S ACCESSIBLE TO THE PUBLIC.
I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE
19:52:19  OF THAT.
AND SO I HAVE A MOTION BY COUNCILMEMBER JONES
19:52:22  AND A SECOND BY COUNCILMEMBER COX,
19:52:25  I THINK, IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY.

19:52:29 >> Councilmember Cox: CORRECT, MADAME MAYOR.
>> Mayor Mei: ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE
19:52:33 .
>> Ms. Gauthier: TO CLARIFY, MADAME MAYOR, THIS IS TO APPROVE
19:52:36  THE ANNUAL REPORT
19:52:40  FOR NOT INCREASING THE FEES, THAT'S CORRECT?
>> Mayor Mei: I JUST
19:52:43  WANTED TO MAKE SURE WITH THE MOTION  MAKERS.
>> Ms. Gauthier: 
19:52:46 BASED ON GREEN SHEET.
>> Mayor Mei: YES.
>> Councilmember Jones: I'M
19:52:49  SORRY, DO YOU NEED TO CLOSE THE MEETING --
19:52:52 
>> Mayor Mei: OH, YES, I NEED TO CLOSE THE PUBLIC
19:52:56  HEARING TOO.
SO COUNCILMEMBER JONES, JUST TO CLARIFY YOUR
19:52:59  MOTION?
>> Councilmember Jones: MOVE TO APPROVE THE ITEM WITH
19:53:02  THE CHANGES SUGGESTED BY DIRECT
19:53:09  LARSEN.
>> SECOND.
>> Mayor Mei: MOTIONED AND SECONDED.

19:53:12 ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE.
>> Ms. Gauthier: COUNCILMEMBER COX,
19:53:16  AYE.
COUNCILMEMBER SHAO, AYE.

19:53:19 COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, AYE.
COUNCILMEMBER JONES, AYE.

19:53:22 COUNCILMEMBER KENG, AYE.

19:53:25 VICE MAYOR SALWAN, AYE.
MAYOR MEI
19:53:28 , AYE.
>> Mayor Mei: THE MOTION PASSES UNANIMOUSLY.

19:53:32 NEXT IS ITEM 7A, WHICH IS THE RESPONSE
19:53:36  TO COUNCILMEMBER KENG'S REFERRAL FROM NOVEMBER
19:53:39  2ND.
AND OUR CITY
19:53:42  MANAGER, KARENA SHACKELFORD, WILL BE
19:53:46  INTRODUCING THIS ITEM, ALONG WITH SUZANNE SHENFIL
19:53:49  WILL PROVIDE A PRESENTATION.

19:53:53 >> City Mgr. Shackelford: THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR.
SO ON NOVEMBER
19:53:56  2ND, THE CITY COUNCIL DIRECTED
19:54:00  STAFF TO RESEARCH GRANTS FOR UNIVERSAL
19:54:04  BASIC PILOT PROGRAM TO AID INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES
19:54:07  OF INCOME AT RISK.
IN THE SPIRIT OF THE
19:54:10  OVERALL CONCEPT OF SUCH A PROGRAM, HE THIS THOUGHT IT IMPORTANT TO
19:54:14  FULLY COVER THIS ITEM BY EXPANDING THE SCOPE TO ALSO
19:54:17  INCLUDE RESEARCH ON GUARANTEE
19:54:20 ED BASIC INCOME PROGRAMS, WHICH IS OFTEN A TERM THAT'S USED
19:54:23  INTERCHANGEABLY WITH UNIVERSAL BASIC INCOME.

19:54:26 ALTHOUGH THEY ARE TWO VERY DIFFERENT THINGS.

19:54:30 SO THE HUMAN SERVICES TEAM HAS SPENT THE LAST
19:54:33  FEW WEEKS RESEARCHING AND ATTENDING
19:54:37  INFORMATION SESSIONS ON THIS VERY
19:54:40  IMPORTANT
19:54:43  TOPIC, SO THEY WILL PRESENT INFORMATION INCLUDING FUNDING
19:54:47  OPPORTUNITIES, IMPLEMENTATION CONSIDERATIONS SUCH AS THE POSSIBLE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL
19:54:50  FUNDING AND/OR  STAFFING RESOURCES
19:54:53 , SO THIS EVENING HUMAN RESOURCES DIRECTOR
19:54:56  SUZANNE SHENFIL AND MANAGEMENT ANALYST GUADALUPE
19:55:01  GONZALEZ WILL SHARE STAFF'S FINDINGS WITH YOU.

19:55:07 WE WILL LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS
19:55:10 , AS WELL AS ANY DIRECTION THAT YOU MAY HAVE FOR US
19:55:13  MOVING FORWARD.
SO WITH THAT,
19:55:17  I WILL TURN IT OVER TO SUZANNE
19:55:20  SHENFIL.
THANK YOU.
>> GOOD EVENING, MAYOR
19:55:23  AND COUNCILMEMBERS.
CAN WE HAVE THE FIRST SLIDE
19:55:26 , PLEASE?
WE HAVE A REALLY
19:55:30  BRIEF POWERPOINT TO SHARE WITH YOU.

19:55:54 WELL
19:55:57  --
>> Ms. Gauthier: I'M SORRY, I'M TRYING TO SHARE
19:55:59  IT HERE.
I'M HAVING AN ISSUE.
MY APOLOGIES.

19:56:03 >> Mayor Mei: NO WORRIES.

19:56:21 >> Mr. Quintanilla: I CAN SHARE ALSO.
>> Ms. Gauthier: THAT WOULD BE GREAT.
I'M HAVING A
19:56:24  PROBLEM GETTING IT UP ON MY SCREEN HERE.

19:56:30 >> Ms. Shenfil: THANK YOU.
NEXT SLIDE, PLEASE.
THANKS, ALBERTO
19:56:34 .
STAFF
19:56:38 , AS CITY MANAGER SHACKELFORD SAID,
19:56:41  THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
19:56:44  UNIVERSAL BASIC INCOME AND WHAT IS CALLED GUARANTEED INCOME
19:56:47 .
THEY ARE NOT THE SAME.

19:56:51 AND WHILE DEAF ANYTHINGS VARY, THE TWO PROGRAMS
19:56:54  REALLY DIFFER IN SCOPE.

19:56:57 UNIVERSAL BASIC INCOME PROVIDES CASH TRANSFER
19:57:00  TO ALL PEOPLE IN A GIVEN LOCALE.

19:57:04 FOR EXAMPLE, EVERY ELIGIBLE ALASKAN
19:57:08  CITIZEN HAS, SINCE 1982, RECEIVED
19:57:11  A YEARLY CASH TRANSFER
19:57:16  FROM THE STATE'S OIL RESERVES.
THEY'RE PROVIDED THIS MONEY ON
19:57:20  AN ANNUAL BASIS, AND THERE ARE NO STIPULATIONS AS TO
19:57:23  HOW THE MONEY CAN BE UTILIZED.

19:57:27 BUT EVERYONE GETS THE CASH
19:57:31  DISBURSAL REGARDLESS OF THEIR INCOME.

19:57:36 BY CONTRAST, A GUARANTEED INCOME PROGRAM IS MORE
19:57:39  TARGETED, PROVIDING A SET AMOUNT
19:57:42  OF FUNDS TO A TARGETED GROUP OF PEOPLE
19:57:45  IN NEED TO COVER BASIC NECESSITIES.
A
19:57:48  GOAL OF A CASH TRANSFER PROGRAM AND
19:57:52  OF THE MANY GUARANTEED INCOME PROJECTS  CROPPING UP AROUND
19:57:55  THE NATION IS TO INCREASE A HOUSEHOLD
19:57:58 'S FINANCIAL STABILITY, EQUIPPING THE HOUSEHOLD WITH
19:58:01  THE TOOLS AND AGENCY TO MEET AND
19:58:05  SURVIVE ECONOMIC CRISES.

19:58:08 THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC REALLY UNDERSCORE
19:58:11 ED THE FINANCIAL DEVASTATION FACED
19:58:15  BY MANY INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES WHO LACK SAVINGS OR
19:58:18  ACCESS TO CASH, RESULTING IN ONGOING
19:58:22  FINANCIAL VOLATILITY.
CASH
19:58:25  TRANSFER PROGRAMS ARE NOT MEANT TO
19:58:28  REDUCE AN INDIVIDUAL OR FAMILY'S CAPACITY TO FIND OR MAINTAIN
19:58:32  WORK, BUT ARE TEMPORARY MEANS TO SUPPORT
19:58:35  THE HOUSEHOLD
19:58:38  IN ACCESSING BETTER OPPORTUNITIES.

19:58:46 ONE OF THE MOST WELL-KNOWN GUARANTEED INCOME PROGRAM
19:58:50 S IS CALLED SEED, OR STOCKTON
19:58:54  ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT DEMONSTRATION.
IT WAS
19:58:57  CHAMPIONED BY FORMER STOCKTON MAYOR MICHAEL
19:59:00  TUBBS, AND SEED
19:59:03  GAVE 125 RESIDENTS $500 PER MONTH FOR
19:59:06  TWO YEARS.
NOW THE
19:59:10  SECOND YEAR, RESEARCH IS FOR THE
19:59:13 -COMING.
THE FIRST YEAR DATA ANALYZED
19:59:16  BY RESEARCHERS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE AND THE
19:59:19  UNIVERSITY OF PALO ALTO SHOW THAT WHEN  COMPARED TO A CONTROL
19:59:22  GROUP, UNCONDITIONAL CASH ENABLED
19:59:26  RECIPIENTS TO FIND FULL-TIME EMPLOYMENT
19:59:29 , THE INCOME ALLEVIATED FDGES
19:59:32  FINANCIAL  SQUARESSITY, CREATING NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR SELF
19:59:35  SELF-TERMINATION, CHOICE, GOAL SETTING
19:59:38  AND RISK-TAKING.
THESE FINDINGS ARE
19:59:41  BEING REFLECTED IN SIMILAR MODELS, INCLUDING
19:59:45  THE SANTA CLARA COUNTY GUARANTEED INCOME PILOT
19:59:49  PROGRAM.

19:59:58 INSPIRED BY THE CITY OF  STOCKTON'S
20:00:03  219 -- EXCUSE ME -- 2019 GUARANTE
20:00:06 ED INCOME PROGRAM, THE STATE OF
20:00:09  CALIFORNIA PASSED AB
20:00:13 153 IN 2021.
THE BILL IS A FIRST OF ITS
20:00:17  KIND FOR THE STATE AND AUTHORIZES THE CALIFORNIA
20:00:21  DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES TO MANAGE
20:00:24  PROGRAM FUNDING.
ON DECEMBER
20:00:27  6, CDSS HELD A STAKEHOLDERS MEETING
20:00:30 ,  HIGHLIGHTING THE NOTION THAT PARTNERSHIPS WITH
20:00:33  LOCAL ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE EXISTING CONNECTIONS
20:00:37  TO AND WORK WITH EMANCIPATED FOSTER YOUTH
20:00:41  AND PREGNANT INDIVIDUALS WILL BE
20:00:45  A
20:00:49  ADVANTAGEOUS.
THE REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS WILL LIKELY BE RELEASED AFTER THE NEW
20:00:52  YEAR.
THE CITY OF FREMONT UNFORTUNATELY DOES NOT
20:00:55  HAVE A SIGNIFICANT POPULATION OF THE
20:00:58  TARGETED DEMOGRAPHIC OF FOSTER CARE
20:01:01  TRANSITIONAL AGE YOUTH TO
20:01:05  MAKE A DISBURSAL OF FUNDING TO FREMONT VERY LIKELY
20:01:08 .
FOR THE PERIOD BETWEEN JULY
20:01:12  2020 TO JUNE 2021, ALAMEDA
20:01:15  COUNTIES FOSTER CARE POPULATION
20:01:18  TOTALED 428 YOUTH, WITH 11 ACROSS THE
20:01:22  COUNTY IDENTIFIED AS BEING IN
20:01:25  THE AGE RANGE OF 18 TO 21.

20:01:28 DURING THIS SAME PERIOD,
20:01:31  56 INDIVIDUALS AGED OUT OR WERE EMANCIPATE
20:01:34 ED.
UNFORTUNATELY,
20:01:37  MORE GRANULAR LEVEL DATA ABOUT OUR NUMBERS OF FOSTER
20:01:41  YOUTH IN OUR AREA IS NOT AVAILABLE.

20:01:45 I'M GOING TO TURN THE PRESENTATION OVER NOW TO GUADALUPE
20:01:48  GONZALEZ.
>> THANK YOU, SUZANNE
20:01:51 .

20:01:55 STAFF RESEARCHED 16 GUARANTEED INCOME PROGRAM
20:01:58 S ACROSS THE NATION.
FIVE OF THESE PROGRAMS LEVERAGE
20:02:02 ED AR PA FUNDS OR AMERICAN RESCUE
20:02:07  ACT FUNDS, CITIES INCLUDING
20:02:11  MOUNTAIN VIEW, SAN FRANCISCO, LONG BEACH, CHICAGO, AND THE COUNTY OF
20:02:15  LOS ANGELES ARE USING AR PA FUNDS FOR
20:02:18  AT LEAST TWO OF THESE PROGRAMS, AR PA IS ONLY ONE PORTION
20:02:21  OF THE FUNDS  REQUIRED TO BEGIN A GUARANTEED INCOME PROGRAM.

20:02:25 THE CITY HAS ALREADY ALLOCATED THE FIRST ROUND OF
20:02:28  AR PA DOLLARS TO BALANCE THE CURRENT YEAR
20:02:31  GENERAL FUND BUDGET AND MAINTAIN EXISTING CORE SERVICES.

20:02:35 CITY STAFF HAVE PROJECTED THE NEED TO EXHAUST THE
20:02:40  SECOND -- OF ARPA FUND TO BALANCE THE TWO FISCAL
20:02:44  BUDGETS.
THE CITY DOES NOT HAVE AN ALLOCATED ARPA FUNDS
20:02:47  TO SUPPORT THE PROGRAM
20:02:50 .
STAFF ALSO WANTED TO NOTE THAT ASSEMBLY BILL
20:02:53  65 AS MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY BY COUNCILMEMBER JONES ON THE NOVEMBER
20:02:56  2ND MEETING HAS BEEN HELD UNDER SUBMISSION SINCE MAY
20:03:01  2021, IN THE STATE'S COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS.
MEANING
20:03:04  THERE'S NO MOTION FOR THE BILL TO MOVE FORWARD.
THE
20:03:07  BILL WOULD HAVE CREATED A STATEWIDE UNIVERSAL
20:03:10  BASIC INCOME PROGRAM ADMINISTERED BY THE
20:03:13  FRANCHISE TAX BOARD.
UNDER THE PROPOSED BILL, ELIGIBLE CALIFORNIAN
20:03:17 S WOULD HAVE RECEIVED $1,000 PER MONTH.

20:03:26 OF THE 16 PROGRAMS THAT STAFF RESEARCHED, EIGHT
20:03:29  PROGRAMS PREDOMINANTLY USED PRIVATE OR PHILANTHROPIC DOLLAR
20:03:33 S IN VARYING AMOUNTS FROM $500,000
20:03:36  TO $8 MILLION.
THE CITY OF FREMONT TYPICALLY RECEIVE
20:03:40 S PHILANTHROPIC GIFTS RANGING FROM
20:03:44  $10,000 TO $50,000.
ADDITIONAL STAFF TIME AND RESOURCES
20:03:47  WOULD BE REQUIRED TO CULTIVATE DONORS,
20:03:50  PRIVATE OR CORPORATE, WITH BOTH THE CAPACITY
20:03:53  TO GIVE A SIGNIFICANT DONATION AND THE DESIRE TO
20:03:56  FUND A GUARANTEED INCOME PROGRAM.

20:04:01 NEXT SLIDE, PLEASE.

20:04:05 COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF GUARANTEED INCOME PROGRAMS INCLUDE,
20:04:08  ONE, CONSIDERABLE COMMUNITY INPUT AT EVERY
20:04:11  STAGE, ESPECIALLY IN THE BEGINNING, TO BETTER TAILOR THE PROGRAM TO
20:04:15  MEET COMMUNITY NEEDS.
TWO, IDENTIFYING A
20:04:18  PARTICIPANT POOL.
USUALLY AMONG THE MOST VULNERABLE
20:04:21  LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES, AND EDUCATING THE GROUP TO UNDERSTAND
20:04:25  THE EFFECT THE GI FUNDS WILL HAVE ON EXIST
20:04:28  EXISTING PUBLIC BENEFITS THE PARTICIPANTS MAY RECEIVE
20:04:32 .
THREE,
20:04:35  PARTNERING WITH A RESEARCH ORGANIZATION, THIS CAN BE A PRIVATE
20:04:38  ANALYTICS -- OR FOR A UNIVERSITY, AND
20:04:41  FOR IDENTIFYING A RESEARCH METHODOLOGY SO THAT DATA AND
20:04:45  ANALYSIS CAN BE DONE BETWEEN THE PARTICIPANT GROUP AND THE
20:04:49  CONTROL GROUP THAT DOES NOT RECEIVE THE CASH.
PROGRAMS TYPICALLY
20:04:52  SERVE BETWEEN 100 TO 300 PARTICIPANTS
20:04:56  WITH LARGER CITIES LIKE LOS ANGELES AND
20:05:00  CHICAGO SERVING
20:05:03  3,200, AND 5,000 PARTICIPANTS RESPECTIVELY.
IF A
20:05:06  LOCAL GOVERNMENT LIKE FREQUENT WERE TO PROVIDE
20:05:10  $500 A MONTH TO 100 INCOME-QUALIFIED
20:05:14  INDIVIDUALS, THE DIRECT CASH TRANSFER COST WOULD BE
20:05:18  $600,000, BUT THIS DOES NOT INCLUDE ADMINISTRATIVE COST OF
20:05:21  THE PROGRAM, INCLUDING OUTREACH, PARTICIPANT SELECTION
20:05:24 , AND PARTNERSHIP WITH RESEARCH ORGANIZATION
20:05:27  OR UNIVERSITY FOR ANALYTICS OF THE DATA.
WITH THESE
20:05:30  ADDITIONAL COSTS, A GUARANTEED INCOME PROGRAM MAY COST
20:05:33  EASILY UPWARDS OF $1 MILLION OR MORE
20:05:37 .
IN CONCLUSION, THE
20:05:40  RESOURCE -- IN CONCLUSION, RESOURCES DO NOT CURRENTLY
20:05:43  EXIST TO FUND A GUARANTEED INCOME PROGRAM.

20:05:47 THE CITY OF PROGRAM HAS ALREADY ALLOCATED ITS
20:05:51  ARPA
20:05:54  FUND AND WILL REQUIRE A
20:05:57  MATCH OF FUNDING.
THE
20:06:00  AMOUNT NEEDED TO FUND A FUNDING MODEST PROGRAM ARE
20:06:04  ALSO UNLIKELY, HUMAN SERVICES DOES NOT HAVE
20:06:07  ADEQUATE STAFF WITHOUT THE REDEPLOYMENT OF PERSONNEL FROM
20:06:10  EXISTING PROGRAMS AND SERVICES.

20:06:18 AND WE ARE AVAILABLE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS.

20:06:23 >> Mayor Mei: SO AT THIS TIME, I'LL TURN TO
20:06:27  OUR COUNCIL FOR CLARIFYING QUESTIONS.
AND I DO KNOW WE HAVE A
20:06:30  PUBLIC SPEAKER TOO.
SO WE'LL START WITH COUNCILMEMBER JONES.

20:06:36 >> Councilmember Jones: THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR.
I NOTICED ON ONE OF THE SLIDES WHEN
20:06:39  MS. SHENFIL WAS PRESENTING THAT -- AND I KNOW WE DON'T
20:06:42  HAVE ENOUGH PARTICIPANTS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ASSEMBLY
20:06:45  BILL 153, BUT AT THE BOTTOM OF
20:06:49  THE SLIDE, IT INDICATED THAT AT LEAST HALF OF THE
20:06:52  FUNDING HAD TO BE  PROVIDED BY THE CITY.

20:06:55 WOULD THAT BE CORRECT IN ANY FUTURE LEGISLATION
20:06:59  GOING  FORWARD?
DO WE HAVE A SENSE OF THAT,
20:07:02   OR -- JUST ANOTHER IDEA
20:07:05 .
>> I THINK AT THIS POINT, NO IDEA,
20:07:09  AB153 IS THE FIRST TIME THE STATE HAS IMPLEMENTED
20:07:12  A PROGRAM LIKE THIS, AND YOU ARE CORRECT IN THAT
20:07:15  THERE IS A 50% MATCHING
20:07:18  REQUIREMENT.
>> AND THEN
20:07:21  MS. GONZALEZ MENTIONED THAT
20:07:25  THE RECEIVING OF THESE FUNDS MAY PUT
20:07:28  IN JEOPARDY OTHER BENEFITS THAT THE PARTICIPANTS ARE CURRENTLY
20:07:31  RECEIVING, IS THAT CORRECT
20:07:37 ?
>> YES, THAT'S CORRECT.

20:07:40 >> Ms. Shenfil: BUT THE DIFFICULTY FOR LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS
20:07:44  IS THAT
20:07:47  SOMETIMES IF THEY EARN A LITTLE BIT MORE MONEY WITH A CASH
20:07:50  TRANSFER PROGRAM, IT DISQUALIFIES THEM FROM OTHER BENEFITS
20:07:54  THEY GET SUCH AT
20:07:57  MEDICAL, FRESH
20:08:01 , FOOD BENEFITS
20:08:04 , IF YOU JUST INCREASE YOUR
20:08:07  INCOME BY A FEW DOLLARS, YOU KIND OF DROP OFF
20:08:10  THE CLIFF IN TERMS OF OTHER BENEFITS YOU QUALIFY
20:08:13  FOR, SO IN IMPLEMENTING THESE TYPES OF CASH TRANSFER
20:08:16  PROGRAMS,
20:08:19  PARTICIPANTS REALLY HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT IT MAY IMPACT OTHER
20:08:22  BENEFITS THEY CURRENTLY GET OR
20:08:27  WAIVERS HAVE TO BE SOUGHT TO ENSURE THAT
20:08:30  PEOPLE ARE ENDING UP
20:08:34  WORSE OFF FROM THE CASH TRANSFER PROGRAM.

20:08:38 >> Councilmember Jones: AND IT SEEMS LIKE AS A GENERAL RULE
20:08:41  FROM THE CITY, SO IF YOU  SURVEYED THESE FUNDS HAVE
20:08:44  BEEN PRIVATELY FUNDED, IS THAT CORRECT?
>> TO A LARGE EXTENT
20:08:47 , YES.
>> Councilmember Jones: OKAY.
THANK YOU
20:08:51 .

20:08:58 >> Mayor Mei: CLARIFYING QUESTIONS, AND WE HAVE A PUBLIC SPEAKER
20:09:02 .
>> ME?
OH, MADAME MAYOR,
20:09:05  WHO DID YOU CALL EARLIER, JUST NOW?

20:09:11 COUNCILMEMBER KENG.
>> I DO HAVE
20:09:14  MY HAND UP.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR
20:09:17  RESEARCH, LOOKING INTO THIS PROGRAM.
I DO HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS
20:09:20 .
IN YOUR RESEARCH WITH THE
20:09:26  BILL 153, HAVE YOU FOUND THAT ESPECIALLY FROM THE
20:09:30  C PROGRAM, CAN WE CONCLUDE THAT THIS WERE TYPE
20:09:33  OF PROGRAM COULD BE BENEFICIAL AND COST-EFFECTIVE
20:09:36  CONSIDERING ITS
20:09:39  COST AND THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT IT COULD HELP, ESPECIALLY
20:09:43  OF THE MOST AT RISK MEMBERS
20:09:46  OF OUR COMMUNITY.

20:09:50 >> Ms. Shenfil: I THINK THE FINDINGS ARE DEMONSTRATING THAT IT
20:09:53  CERTAINLIESES OUT VOLATILITY FOR LOW
20:09:57  INCOME HOUSEHOLDS.
IT'S NOT AN ANSWER TO ENDING
20:10:00  POVERTY, PER SE, BUT IT IS HELPFUL
20:10:03 , BUT THESE ARE ALL DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS
20:10:06  THAT LAST FOR ONE TO THREE YEARS.
SO THEY'RE
20:10:09  REALLY IN -- KIND OF
20:10:13  IN THE VAIR
20:10:16  EXPERIMENTAL
20:10:20  STAGES AT THE MOMENT.
>> Councilmember Keng: I KNOW WE'VE
20:10:23  KIND OF AN
20:10:28  ANALYZED SOME OF THE FUNDING SOURCES.
FOR EXAMPLE, I'M WONDERING,
20:10:31  LOOKING AT HOW SOME OF THE SMALLER CITIES ARE ABLE TO FUND
20:10:35  THEIR, HAVE WE
20:10:38  TRIED TO SEE IF WE CAN'T DO THE
20:10:41  SAME, OF THOSE FUNDING?
>> WELL
20:10:44 , SOME OF THE SUCCESSFUL
20:10:47  PROGRAMS RECEIVED A SIZABLE
20:10:51  CONTRIBUTION FROM JACK DORSEY, WHO'S TWITTER
20:10:54 'S CEO.
I KNOW IN MOUNTAIN VIEW AND
20:10:58  SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, THERE ARE LARGE
20:11:02  TECH CORPORATIONS THAT ARE PHILANTHROPIC IN
20:11:05  NATURE, AND UNFORTUNATELY
20:11:09 , WE'RE NOT AT THAT POINT YET
20:11:11  OF HAVING THOSE KINDS OF COMPANIES THAT COULD MAKE
20:11:15  SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTIONS.

20:11:25 >> Councilmember Keng: SO FACEBOOK AND TESLA ARE IN FREMONT, RIGHT?
I DON'T KNOW IF WE
20:11:28  HAVE MADE THOSE ASKS YET, LIKE
20:11:32  I KNOW THAT DURING A PANDEMIC, WE HAD
20:11:35  COMPANIES THAT -- BIOMEDICAL COMPANIES
20:11:39  THAT YOU REACHED OUT TO,
20:11:42  FOR EXAMPLE, THE FOURTH OF JULY PARADE
20:11:45  IS ENTIRELY FUNDED, 90% FUNDED
20:11:49  BY PRIVATE DONORS.
AS WELL AS, YOU KNOW
20:11:52 , WE'VE RECEIVED A LARGE PART OF
20:11:55  OUR -- WE RECEIVE A LARGE AMOUNT OF FUNDING FOR
20:11:59  OUR AFGHAN FUND.
SO
20:12:04  I KNOW THE
20:12:07  STAFF TIME IS LIMITED, BUT DO
20:12:10  YOU THINK -- CAN
20:12:14  WE CONSIDER CASTING OUR NETS WIDER AND ENGAGE IN
20:12:17  CONVERSATION WITH MANY LOCAL PARTNERS WHO HAPPEN TO
20:12:22  BE PHILANTHROPIC TO OUR COMMUNITY
20:12:25 ?

20:12:31 >> City Mgr. Shackelford: THE STAFF REPORT IS REALLY IN RESPONSE TO THE MOTION YOU AND YOUR
20:12:34  COLLEAGUES MADE ON NOVEMBER 2ND, WHICH WAS TO
20:12:40  EVALUATE OR RESEARCH GRANT OPPORTUNITIES OR FUNDING
20:12:44  OPPORTUNITIES TO SUPPORT SUCH A PROGRAM AND COME BACK TO
20:12:47  YOU ALL WITH THAT INFORMATION,
20:12:50  AND THAT'S WHAT YOU HAVE BEFORE YOU TONIGHT.
SO
20:12:54  THE DIRECT ANSWER TO YOUR QUELL IS NO, WE HAVE NOT
20:12:57  ENGAGED SOME OF OUR LARGER CORPORATIONS
20:13:00  WHO WERE WITHIN OUR CITY BOUNDARY
20:13:04 IES.
SHOULD YOUR DIRECTION TONIGHT BE THAT YOU'RE
20:13:07  INTERESTED IN THAT, THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE COULD CERTAINLY
20:13:11  CONSIDER, BUT AGAIN, I WOULD WANT TO WARN YOU ABOUT  THE --
20:13:15  OR CAUTION YOU, I'M  SORRY, WARN IS TOO STRONG OF A WORD
20:13:18 , CAUTION YOU ABOUT THE STAFF IMPLICATIONS
20:13:22  OF PURSUING THAT.

20:13:25 YOU KNOW, A PHILANTHROPY
20:13:28  ARM IS ANOTHER DIVISION,
20:13:32  SO TO SPEAK, IT REQUIRES A LOT OF
20:13:35  TIME, EFFORT AND INNER
20:13:38  -- IN TERMS OF THE
20:13:43  DONATIONS.
SO IF THAT IS SOMETHING THAT YOUR COLLEAGUES ARE INCLINED TO
20:13:48  PURSUE, I WOULD JUST ENCOURAGE YOU TO CONSIDER THOSE IMPLICATIONS AND UNDERSTAND THAT IT WOULD
20:13:51  BE AT THE COST OF SOME OTHER
20:13:54  SERVICES THAT WE MAY BE CURRENTLY PROVIDING.

20:14:02 >> UNDERSTAND.
THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: JUST WANTED TO CHECK --

20:14:05 >> THAT'S ALL MY QUESTIONS FOR NOW.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
ARE THERE ANY
20:14:09  -- COUNCILMEMBER COX, CLARIFYING QUESTIONS?
AND COUNCILMEMBER
20:14:12  KASSAN.
WHICH HAVE
20:14:15 WE HAVE ONE PUBLIC SPEAKER, BEFORE WE GO INTO
20:14:18  DISCUSSIONS.
>> Councilmember Cox: I CAN WAIT
20:14:21  UNTIL AFTER THE SPEAKER.
THAT'S PERFECTLY FINE.
>> I
20:14:24  SEE BOTH OF YOU NODDING.
LISA
20:14:27  DANZ, I'M GOING TO OPEN UP FOR PUBLIC COMMENT
20:14:31  ON THIS.
GLG THANK YOU.
I WAS EXCITED
20:14:34  BEFORE ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF HAVING A GUARANTEE
20:14:37 ED INCOME PROGRAM IN FREMONT, AND IT'S
20:14:40  A BUSINESS DISAPPOINTING TO SEE THAT WE'VE EVALUATED
20:14:43  A LOT OF OPTIONS AND DON'T THINK THEY'LL WORK
20:14:46 .
I'M NOT GOING TO WEIGH IN TOO MUCH ON THAT JUST BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOU ALL ARE
20:14:49  THE EXPERTS ON IT.
I DO APPRECIATE COUNCILMEMBER
20:14:52  KENG'S IDEAS ABOUT WHERE ELSE TO PURSUE THE FUNDING, BUT WHAT I
20:14:55  WANT TO SAY, IF YOU FEEL THAT YOU SUPPORT THE IDEA OF GUARANTEED
20:14:59  INCOME BUT YOU DON'T THINK THE CITY IS THE RIGHT PLACE TO ADMINISTER
20:15:02  IT, THEN I WOULD ASK THE SKI TO TAKE AFFIRMATIVE STEPS
20:15:06  TO SUPPORT HAVING
20:15:09  SUCH -- FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOU THINK IT SHOULD
20:15:12  BE ADMINISTERED AT THE STATE LEVEL
20:15:15  AND ASSEMBLY BILL 65 IS THE RIGHT VEHICLE TO DO SO, THEN
20:15:18  YOU
20:15:23  COULD SUPPORT A RESOLUTION
20:15:26  ON THE BILL.
IF YOU THINK THAT'S THE RIGHT PLACE FOR IT
20:15:30 , SIMILARLY YOU COULD WORK WITH THE
20:15:33  -- DON'T STOP HERE IF WE DON'T THINK
20:15:36  THE CITY -- THERE'S STILL ACTION THE CITY
20:15:40  COULD TAKE TO SUPPORT THIS PROGRAM ELSEWHERE.
THANK YOU
20:15:43 .
>> THANK YOU.
LISA,
20:15:46  AND I SEE NO OTHER COMMENTS SO WE'RE GOING TO CLOSE THE
20:15:50  PUBLIC COMMENT, WE'RE GOING TO TURN IT BACK OVER TO THE COUNCIL FOR SOME COMMENTS
20:15:53  AND CONVERSATION ON THIS TOPIC.
WE'LL BEGIN WITH COUNCILMEMBER COX.

20:15:57 >> Councilmember Cox: THANK YOU.
I WANT TO THANK SO MUCH
20:16:00  FOR COUNCILMEMBER KENG FOR BRINGING
20:16:03  THIS FORWARD FOR OUR DISCUSSION.
AND I REALLY
20:16:07  APPRECIATE SUZANNE AND
20:16:12  LUPE FOR BOTH OF
20:16:15  THEIR EFFORTS IN REACHING OUT AND  DOING RESEARCH
20:16:19  TO DO
20:16:23  DO DILIGENCE.
I WANTED TO MAKE SURE, AM
20:16:26  I  HEARING THIS CORRECTLY, THAT BASED ON I GUESS
20:16:29  THE CITY OF FREMONT'S PROFILE OF THE POPULATION OF FOSTER
20:16:33  YOUTH, THAT WE WOULD NOT BE IN THE PROFILE TO RECEIVE
20:16:37  ANY OF THAT SPECIAL MONEY THAT WOULD BE
20:16:40  USED FOR SOME OF THE RESEARCH PROJECTS THAT YOU DID
20:16:43  FOR FUNDING  SOURCES?
IS THAT WHAT
20:16:46  I HEARD?

20:16:50 >> Ms. Shenfil: YES, FIRST OF ALL THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING AVAILABLE STATEWIDE
20:16:53  IS ONLY $35 MILLION, WHICH IS A RELATIVELY
20:16:56  SMALL AMOUNT, AND WE JUST DON'T FEEL WELL HAVE THE TARGET POPULATION
20:17:00  THAT WOULD
20:17:06  MAKE HIM ELIGIBLE IN A COMPETITIVE PROCESS.
>> 
20:17:09 OKAY.
I'VE SEEN THAT ALSO IN DIFFERENT PROFILES
20:17:12 , THINGS THAT I'VE TRIED TO DO OVER THE YEARS.

20:17:15 ONE OF THE THINGS I GUESS WITH THE UNIQUENESS OF
20:17:19  FORMER MAYOR OF STOCKTON,
20:17:22  MICHAEL STUBBS,
20:17:25  AT THAT TIME STOCKTON WAS
20:17:29  IN
20:17:32  -- TO GET THESE OTHER SPECIAL PROGRAMS THAT HELP SUPPORT THEIR
20:17:36  COMMUNITY, AND WE HAVE A MUCH LARGER
20:17:39  COMMUNITY OF COLOR THAT WE DO HERE IN FREMONT.
IS THAT
20:17:43  NOT CORRECT?
MS. MARGOLIS I
20:17:48 
>> Ms. Shenfil: I CAN'T SPEAK TO WHETHER OR NOT THEY WERE IN 
20:17:52 BANKRUPTCY.
I KNOW THEY WERE AT ONE TIME, BUT IF THEY WERE WHEN THIS PROJECT
20:17:55  IS INITIATED, I'M NOT SURE.

20:18:03 
>> Councilmember Cox: OKAY, I WAS JUST CURIOUS.

20:18:07 THERE WAS DIFFERENT LANDSCAPE THAN OUR SITUATION THERE.

20:18:10 MY CONCERN IS THAT I KNOW THERE WAS A LOT
20:18:14  OF GREAT RESEARCH, AND WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE DONOR
20:18:17  PROFILE THAT WAS AVERAGING 10 TO
20:18:20  50,000, THERE IS A GAP IN TERMS OF SUSTAIN
20:18:24 ABILITY OF CONSTANT DONATIONS
20:18:27  COMING IN TO SUPPORT THIS, AND
20:18:32  ALSO I'M CONCERNED ABOUT
20:18:35  LOOKING IN TERMS OF THE WHOLE ADMINISTERING.
IT'S NOT JUST THE MONEY
20:18:38  THAT GETS PASSED ON TO THOSE THAT NEED IT.
BUT
20:18:41  IT'S ALSO THE  ADMINISTRATION,
20:18:44  THE COST BECAUSE THERE'S ALWAYS AWLS ADMINISTRATIVE FEES THAT ARE TAKEN
20:18:48  TAKEN OUT OF THE FUNDING TO SUPPORT THE
20:18:51  INFRASTRUCTURE AND HOW THEY'RE GOING TO REPORT OUT THE FUNDING AND THE
20:18:54  RECEIPTS AND EVEN
20:18:57  FINDING WHAT DAY THEY RECEIVED IT AND WHAT WAS
20:19:01  DISPENSED AT WHICH INSTITUTION, SO IT'S A LOT OF TRACKING,
20:19:04  AND I'M CONCERNED IN TERMS OF ALSO
20:19:07  THE -- PROVIDING COUNSELING, BECAUSE ONCE PEOPLE GET
20:19:11  THE MONEY, IT'S ALSO NOT JUST A GIVE
20:19:14  GIVEAWAY CHECK.
IT'S ALSO TO HELP THEM TAKE TO THE NEXT
20:19:17  LEVEL, RIGHT, THAT
20:19:21  THERE'S IMPROVEMENT OF SELF TRAINING AND COURSES AND
20:19:24  THINGS TO BETTER THEM, AND JUST HAVING SOMEONE AS A
20:19:27  COUNSELOR OR COACH OR MENTOR TO WALK THEM
20:19:31  THROUGH THIS PART OF THEIR LIVES.

20:19:34 I'M ALSO, YOU KNOW, WHEN I HEAR ABOUT
20:19:37  LIKE BLOOM ENERGY OPENING UP AND HAVING
20:19:42  CLOSE TO 300 MANUFACTURING JOBS HERE IN FREMONT, YOU KNOW,
20:19:45  THOSE ARE THINGS THAT I'M THINKING THAT SOME OF OUR
20:19:48  FOSTER YOUTH, HOW TO REACH
20:19:51  OUT AND GET THE  ADVERTISEMENT IN TO THEM THAT
20:19:54  THEY COULD BE SUPPORTING, IF THEY'RE OF THE WORKING AGE, OF COURSE,
20:19:58  BUT THOSE ARE SOME OTHER ALTERNATIVES TO THINK
20:20:01  ABOUT  EARNING THEIR FUNDING AND  GETTING TO
20:20:04  THEIR POINT OF INDEPENDENCE THERE AND LEARNING A NEW SKILL
20:20:08  AND THINGS LIKE  THAT.
FOR THOSE THAT ARE
20:20:11  IMPACTED.
BECAUSE I THINK OUR LAST DISCUSSION WHEN WE BROUGHT IT -- WHEN IT
20:20:14  WAS DISCUSSED, IT WAS FOCUSING ON FOSTER
20:20:18  YOUTH AND
20:20:21  SINGLE MOTHERS.
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, COUNCILMEMBER KENG?

20:20:28 >> Councilmember Keng: YEAH, ACTUALLY WE KIND OF EXPANDED THAT
20:20:32  TO FAMILIES IN NEED IN GENERAL
20:20:35 , YOU KNOW, SO
20:20:39  FAMILIES AT RISK.
SO NOT JUST
20:20:42  LIMITED
20:20:46  --
20:20:50 
>> City Mgr. Shackelford: AB153 FOCUSES PRIMARILY ON
20:20:53  FOSTER YOUTH WHO ARE AGING OUT OF THE
20:20:56  SYSTEM AND --
20:21:01 
>> Councilmember Cox: EMANCIPATE D, YEAH, BECAUSE IT'S A NARROWER
20:21:05  FOCUS THAN YOU HAD MENTIONED IT, SO IT'S NOT ALL
20:21:08  IN THE BUCKETS THAT -- THEY WERE TRYING TO REACH THINGS THAT WOULD
20:21:11  BE IN THOSE BUCKETS AND THEY REALLY ONLY FOUND
20:21:15  ONE SOURCE.

20:21:18 SO I DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT TRYING TO ROLL THIS OUT, BECAUSE THE OTHER
20:21:22  PART IS THEN, WHAT OTHER PROGRAMS WILL BE LACKING TO SUPPORT
20:21:25  THE COMMUNITY THAT WE'VE ALREADY AGREED TO
20:21:28  IN TERMS OF OUR BUDGET
20:21:33  AND BEING ABLE TO A LOT THE STAFF TO MANAGE WHAT WE DO HAVE.

20:21:36 I THINK IT WAS IN THE STACK REPORT, WE HAVE ONE OF
20:21:39  THE  LOWEST RATIOS OF SUCH
20:21:42  EFFICIENT, TALENTED STAFF THAT BE KEEP US GOING
20:21:46  THAT IT'S AMAZING
20:21:49  THE WORK THAT YOU DO
20:21:53 , BEING SO CAREFUL ON WATCHING INCREASES IN
20:21:56  STAFF, BUT ALSO WE'RE ALLOCATING THINGS THAT
20:22:00  WERE ALREADY DOING WELL.
SO I'M CONCERNED IN TERMS
20:22:03  OF THE BUDGET, IN TERMS OF YOU'RE REALLY TALKING MORE
20:22:06  OF A -- WHEN YOU'RE TALKING 75 TO
20:22:10  100 INDIVIDUALS, IT IS QUITE A BIT OF MONEY, AND IT'S
20:22:13  MORE THAN JUST $600,000.
IT'S, YOU KNOW
20:22:16 , AS THE STAFF HAD MENTIONED, CLOSE TO A
20:22:19  MILLION DOLLARS, AND I KNOW OOF WORKED WITH OTHER FOUNDATIONS
20:22:22  AND THINGS, AND IT'S A LOT MORE THAN WHAT YOU
20:22:26  CAN EXPECT.
SOMETIMES YOU CAN WRITE
20:22:29  ONLY 10% OFF BUT THERE'S A LOT MORE WORK THAT GOES INTO IT.

20:22:32 BUT I THINK IT'S A NOBLE IDEA.
I THINK THE
20:22:35  TIMING MAY BE OFF ON THIS
20:22:38  AND DISREGARD
20:22:41  TO LOOK AT THIS AT THIS TIME.
I'M GOING
20:22:44  TO LET SOME OTHER COUNCILMEMBERS SPEAK, BUT THOSE ARE MY INITIAL THOUGHTS.

20:22:49 >> Mayor Mei: SURE.
THANK YOU, COUNCILMEMBER COX.
I JUST WANT TO
20:22:52  ACKNOWLEDGE, I KNOW THAT ECONOMIC DEVELOP
20:22:56  DEVELOPMENT -- I HAVE BEEN TALKING TO SEVERAL
20:22:59  COMPANIES,
20:23:03  ONE REQUIRES ONLY A HIGH  SCHOOL DEGREE TO BEGIN IN THOSE AREA
20:23:06 S AS WELL AS HEALTH
20:23:10  PROGRAM THAT WE PARTNER WITH OHLONE.
THOSE ARE OPPORTUNITIES WHERE WE COULD PROBABLY
20:23:13  REALLY UPSKILL
20:23:16  PEOPLE, NOT JUST FOR INCOME BUT FOR SKILLSETS
20:23:19  THAT THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO --
20:23:23  -- VERY SUPPORTIVE
20:23:26  OF CONTINUING TO PURSUE AND EXPAND UPON.
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN?

20:23:29 >> Councilmember Kassan: THANK YOU.
I REALLY WANT TO
20:23:33  ACKNOWLEDGE COUNCILMEMBER KENG FOR COMING FORWARD WITH A
20:23:37  VERY BOLD PROPOSAL.
TO BE TOTALLY HONEST, WE
20:23:40  DON'T OFTEN DO THAT.
IT'S VERY HARD
20:23:44 , GIVEN OUR FORM OF GOVERNMENT, TO MAKE REALLY
20:23:47  BOLD MOVES, BUT I THINK OUR CURRENT SITUATION
20:23:50  REALLY CALLS FOR SOMETHING VERY, VERY
20:23:54  BOLD.
WE ARE JUST SEEING
20:23:57  DEVASTATING POVERTY AND INCREASING, YOU
20:24:00   KNOW, MAJOR GAP IN WEALTH AND INCOME
20:24:03 , AND, YOU KNOW, YES, THERE ARE JOBS, BUT THERE
20:24:06  ARE SO MANY PEOPLE THAT HAVE SO MANY BARRIERS TO EMPLOYMENT AND
20:24:10  WE'VE SEEN EVIDENCE THAT THESE KINDS OF -- THIS KIND OF
20:24:13  PROGRAM CAN REALLY HELP PEOPLE ADDRESS THEIR
20:24:16  MOST BASIC NEEDS SO THEN THEY CAN GO OUT AND GET A
20:24:19  JOB.
SO I'VE REALLY --
20:24:22  AND HONESTLY, IT'S NOT THAT EXPENSIVE CONSIDER
20:24:26  CONSIDERING THE IMPACT IT CAN HAVE.
AND OBVIOUSLY
20:24:29  WE WOULD START WITH A
20:24:32  SMALL PROGRAM TO PROVE THAT IT IS SOMETHING THAT REALLY MAKES SENSE, BUT I WOULD
20:24:35  BE VERY, VERY SUPPORTIVE OF
20:24:42   EXPLORING SOURCES OF FUNDING.
WE DO HAVE
20:24:45  VERY BIG COMPANIES IN FREMONT, THAT
20:24:49  FOR THEM, SEVERAL HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS WOULD BE
20:24:52  A DROP IN THE BUCKET.

20:24:55 TECH, A LOT OF THEM ARE TALKING ABOUT THIS KIND OF SOLUTION TO
20:24:59  THE PROBLEM THAT WE'RE FACING AS A COUNTRY
20:25:02 , AS A PLEA NET IN TERMS OF INCOME
20:25:05  AND EQUALITY.
SO I WOULD VERY, VERY MUCH
20:25:09  SUPPORT PUTTING SOME REAL RESOURCES
20:25:13  TOWARDS TAKING THIS IDEA TO THE NEXT STEP.

20:25:19 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU, COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN.
NEXT, COUNCILMEMBER KENG, DID YOU
20:25:21  HAVE COMMENTS?
I ALSO SEE A COUPLE OF YEUR COLLEAGUES.

20:25:25 I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE --
>> SO I DO
20:25:29  HAVE COMMENTS.
I THANK YOU VERY MUCH,
20:25:32 , COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, FOR YOUR COMMENTS
20:25:35 .
I DO ECHO YOUR SENTIMENTS.
WE
20:25:38  HAVE SEEN PROBABLY THE MOST UNPRECEDENTED CHALLENGES TO
20:25:41  COMMUNITIES, SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC.
WE
20:25:45  SEE PEOPLE.
ED UP MILES LONG, FAMILIES
20:25:48   LOSING LOVED ONES,
20:25:51  SOMETIMES IT'S NOT JUST THE JOB OPPORTUNITIES.

20:25:54 THEIR HEALTH HAS BEEN IMPACTED, THEY'RE STILL RECOVER
20:25:58 ING FROM LOSING FAMILY MEMBERS, AND YOU KNOW,
20:26:01  WE'VE SEEN POVERTY RISEN
20:26:04  MORE THAN EVER, YOU KNOW, WE HAVE
20:26:08  4,000 -- BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,
20:26:11  THANK YOU VERY MUCH, SUZANNE, FOR YOUR RESEARCH, BUT HONEST
20:26:15 LY WE DON'T HAVE A NUMBER ON HOW MANY OF THESE FOSTER KIDS, YOU KNOW
20:26:18 , WE ACTUALLY HAVE IN FREMONT, RIGHT?

20:26:21 BUT AS A
20:26:25  -- I WOULD URGE FOR US TO PARTNER UP WITH THE COUNTY
20:26:28  AND TRY TO, YOU KNOW, PROVIDE
20:26:31  RESOURCES FOR THESE KIDS THAT ARE AMONG
20:26:35  THE HIGHEST RISK TO BE HOMELESS.
I
20:26:38  KNOW CONSIDERING THE IMPACT THAT SPENDING
20:26:42  $1 MILLION, 100 PEOPLE, RIGHT, WE'RE SPENDING
20:26:46  $1 MILLION ON, YOU KNOW, LIKE SOMETIMES
20:26:49  10 PEOPLE AND IT DOESN'T HAVE AN IMPACT THAT THIS PROGRAM COULD HAVE.

20:26:53 SO I DO WANT TO URGE FOR US
20:26:56  TO CONSIDER A SMALLER PROGRAM.
I KNOW
20:27:00  THAT WE ARE -- WE DON'T
20:27:03  HAVE FUNDING READILY AVAILABLE RIGHT NOW, BUT
20:27:06  I DO WANT TO
20:27:10  -- WE DO HAVE -- THE NUMBERS THAT WE DO
20:27:14  HAVE, IT'S BEEN IN THE NEWS, IS THERE ARE
20:27:19  4,000 SAN JOSÉ STATE UNIVERSITY STUDENTS,
20:27:22  FOR EXAMPLE, THAT ARE CURRENTLY LIVING IN THEIR CARS, AND HOW
20:27:25  MANY OF THOSE STUDENTS COULD BE FREMONT RESIDENTS, RIGHT?

20:27:28 AND YOU KNOW, AS RECENT
20:27:31  AS WE HAVE BEEN GETTING THE REPORTS
20:27:34  ON WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING ON  HOMELESSNESS
20:27:38 , WE ARE -- THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT
20:27:41  ARE LEFT BEHIND, BECAUSE I ACTUALLY ASKED
20:27:45  THIS QUESTION, LIKE SO WE ARE
20:27:51  PLACING FOLKS THAT WOULD TYPICALLY BE PLACED AT
20:27:55  THESE WINTER SHELTERS AND HOTELS RIGHT NOW, AND IT HAS PROVEN
20:27:58  TO BE VERY SUCCESSFUL, BUT WHEN I
20:28:02  ASK COLLEGE STUDENTS QUALIFIED TO BE PLACED AT  HOTELS?

20:28:05 THEY'RE NOT.
SO ONLY PEOPLE WHO
20:28:08  ARE  CONSIDERED CHRONICALLY HOME
20:28:11 LESS CAN BE PLACED, RIGHT?

20:28:14 SO THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE LEFT BEHIND, THAT'S WHY WE ARE
20:28:17  SEEING MORE TENTS POPPING UP AND
20:28:21 , YOU KNOW, OVER THE CITY,
20:28:24  PEOPLE  LIVING IN THEIR RVs.
SO I WOULD URGE
20:28:28  THE CITY COUNCIL TO DIRECT THE STAFF TO WORK HARDER.

20:28:31 I KNOW WE DO HAVE A LIMIT ON OUR RESOURCES
20:28:34  BUT IF WE CAN AT
20:28:38  LEAST KIND OF CONSIDER IT OR
20:28:41  HAVE -- DEDICATE A TINY BIT
20:28:44  OF TIME TO ASK AROUND SOME OF OUR LARGER COMPANIES IN
20:28:47  TOWN, I BELIEVE THAT WITH
20:28:50  SOME OF THE BIGGER FIRMS
20:28:53 , WE CAN EASILY PUT TOGETHER A
20:28:56  MILLION DOLLARS THAT COULD BENEFIT 100 PEOPLE THAT COULD BE
20:28:59  THEIR LIFELINE AND
20:29:02  GETTING $500 A MONTH THAT COULD, YOU KNOW, PUT FOOD ON
20:29:05  THEIR TABLE, THAT COULD ALLOW THEM
20:29:09  TO AT LEAST PAY RENT
20:29:13  OR GET SOMETHING FOR THEIR KIDS, THINGS LIKE THAT
20:29:16 .
SO
20:29:19  IT WOULD GREATLY IMPROVE THEIR QUALITY
20:29:22  OF LIFE.
I STRONGLY URGE THE
20:29:25  COUNCIL TO STILL KEEP THIS AS A
20:29:29  CONSIDERATION, KNOWING HOW MUCH IT COULD BENEFIT
20:29:32  THE MOST AT
20:29:35  RISK AMONG US.
FREMONT PRICE
20:29:38  PRIDES ITSELF IN BEING A COMPASSIONATE CITY, AND WE HAVE MANY
20:29:42  OF US THAT ARE BEING LEFT BEHIND RIGHT NOW.
SO
20:29:45  THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SAY.
THANK YOU.

20:29:48 >> Mayor Mei: SO THANK YOU, COUNCILMEMBER KENG.
ABSOLUTELY, I THINK THE
20:29:51  BEST WAY TO PREVENT HOMELESSNESS IS TO KEEP THEME PEEM FROM BECOMING SO
20:29:54  PEOPLE FROM BECOMING
20:29:58  SO, THAT'S WHY WE'VE GIVEN RENTAL ASSISTANCE TO OVER
20:30:01  777 FAMILIES AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO.
I THINK WE HAVE ANOTHER
20:30:04  TRANCHE OF ABOUT 6 MILLION LEFT IN THAT POOL BUT
20:30:08  IT'S BACK TO RENT AND UTILITIES AND WE'VE ALSO HELPED SOME OF THE BUSINESSES STAY
20:30:11  AFLOAT BY GIVING OUT OVER $1 MILLION IN
20:30:14  SMALL BUSINESS GRANTS TO KEEP BUSINESSES
20:30:18  OPERATIONAL.
WE'RE ON A CALL THIS WEEK
20:30:21  WITH THE COUNTY, THAT SPEAKS SPECIFICALLY
20:30:24  FOR HOMELESSNESS.

20:30:27 >> Councilmember Keng:UNDERSTAN D, MAYOR, BUT THE POINT I WAS MAKING IS,
20:30:30  IF THE CURRENT PROGRAMS
20:30:36  CAN CATCH EVERYONE, THEN WE WOULDN'T SEE ALL THE TENTS
20:30:39  POPPING UP IN THE CITY.
SO
20:30:43  THAT'S ALL THE POINT -- MY POINT THAT I'M TRYING TO MAKE
20:30:46 .
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
THAT'S WHY THIS PROGRAM IS 
20:30:49 REVOLUTIONARY WITH EVERYONE  HOME, AND WE'RE WAITING FOR THE LITIGATION DISCUSSION ON
20:30:55  MEASURE W.
SO WHEN THAT FUNDING BECOMES AVAILABLE
20:30:58 , WE ARE AGGRESSIVELY WITH
20:31:01  WITH SOME SORT OF RESOLUTION ON THAT.

20:31:05 COUNCILMEMBER JONES.

20:31:09 >> Councilmember Jones: THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR.
WHILE I APPRECIATE THE IDEA
20:31:12  BEHIND THIS, AGAIN, MOST  PROGRAMS ARE FUNDED
20:31:15  PRIVATELY
20:31:19 .
TO LOOK AT THE STAFF WE HAVE, I THINK OUR STAFFING RATIO IS
20:31:22  .4 EMPLOYEES PER THOUSAND PEOPLE OF POPULATION, WHICH IS THE  LOWEST
20:31:26  IN THE BAY AREA.
AND YET THEY DO A PHENOMENAL
20:31:29   JOB, BULL THIS IS A VERY
20:31:33  TIME INTENSIVE TYPE OF EFFORT.

20:31:36 MY WIFE IS ON
20:31:39  THE BOARD OF A NON-PROFIT AND I IT KEL YOU THE CONSTANT FUNDRAISING
20:31:42  IS  YEAR-ROUND.
AGAIN, WE DON'T HAVE THE DONORS IN FREMONT
20:31:46  THAT COME UP
20:31:49  WITH THE HUGE NUMBERS THAT STOCKTON WAS ABLE TO GET FROM MR. 
20:31:52 DORSEY.
THAT WAS A HUGE BENEFIT TO HIM.
I BELIEVE HE FUNDED PROBABLY
20:31:55  THE MAJORITY OF THAT PROGRAM.

20:31:58 SO THE OUTREACH TO FACEBOOK, THE
20:32:02  OUTREACH TO TESLA, SOME OF THESE OTHER COMPANIES, THAT'S FINE
20:32:05 , BUT YOU KNOW, MAYBE WE SHOULD CONSIDER
20:32:08  EITHER A NON-PROFIT TAKING THAT ON AND
20:32:11  DOING THAT OUTREACH, BUT BEYOND THAT
20:32:14 , THIS IS SOMETHING THAT, AGAIN, WE'VE
20:32:17  PROVIDED FUNDING FOR RENT RELIEF AND ALL OF THOSE KINDS OF  THINGS.

20:32:21 THE COUNTY HAS A NUMBER OF PROGRAMS.
I'VE BEEN
20:32:24  INVOLVED WITH THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM IN THE PAST, AND THEY HAVE A
20:32:28  NUMBER OF PROGRAMS THAT ARE SUPPORTIVE OF THE FOSTER
20:32:31  YOUTH.
IT ALL COMES DOWN TO MONEY, AND UNFORTUNATELY,
20:32:35  CITIES CAN'T AFFORD TO DO THESE THINGS.
IT'S GOING TO HAVE TO FALL
20:32:38  ON THE COUNTY AND STATE OR TO PRIVATE DONORS TO DO IT
20:32:41 .
FREMONT IS CURRENTLY SECOND TO
20:32:44  LAST IN THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE IT RECEIVES
20:32:47  FOR PROPERTY TAXES AND OTHER ISSUES THROUGHOUT THE COUNTY
20:32:51 .
WHICH IS REALLY KIND OF SAD, BEING A CITY OUR
20:32:55  SIZE, I WISH WE COULD FIND
20:32:58  A WAY TO RECTIFY  THAT, BUT
20:33:01  IT ENDS UP TAKING AWAY FROM OTHER CITIES.
THE FOCUS RIGHT NOW
20:33:04 , I THINK, SHOULD BE ON GETTING PEOPLE WHO ARE LIVING IN
20:33:08  THEIR VEHICLES INTO MORE STABLE HOUSING.

20:33:12 AND WE HAVE -- I THINK LAST YEAR
20:33:15  YEAR'S COUNT WAS
20:33:19  408.
I'M GOING TO ASSUME THAT'S GOING TO BE HIGHER THIS YEAR
20:33:22 , I'VE SEEN AN INCREASE IN
20:33:26  -- THERE'S A HUGE INCREASE IN THE VALLEJO
20:33:30  PARK AREA.
THOSE ARE PEOPLE IN DESPERATE
20:33:33  NEED OF SERVICES.
AND IF WE HAD ANY ADDITIONAL MONEY, WHICH WE
20:33:37  DON'T, BUT IF WE COULD GET ANY ADDITIONAL
20:33:40  MONEY, THAT'S WHERE IT SHOULD BE  TARGETED
20:33:43  TO.
SO YOU KNOW, I THINK
20:33:46  WHAT WILL WE'VE DONE SO FAR WITH THE FUNDING THAT WE'VE HAD HAS MADE
20:33:49  A BIG DIFFERENCE
20:33:53 , BUT TO SAY THAT WE HAVE A MILLION DOLLARS WHEN NEXT YEAR, WE'RE
20:33:56  LOOKING AT A POSSIBLE BUDGET SHORTFALL, WHICH IS WHY WE'RE USING
20:34:00  THE  ARPA MONEY TO MAKE UP THAT  SHORTFALL,
20:34:03  AND WITH THE EXPENSES THAT WE HAVE
20:34:06  COMING UP,%, WE'RE COMING INTO
20:34:09  THE FIFTH YEAR OF THEIR
20:34:13  -- WE HAVE A LOT OF
20:34:18 .
THE ONLY WAY WE COULD FUND A PROGRAM LIKE THIS
20:34:21  WOULD BE TO CUT SERVICES
20:34:24  SOMEWHERE ELSE.
SO WHO MAKES THAT DECISION AND HOW FAIR
20:34:27  IS THAT?
I'M ALL IN FAVOR OF GETTING GRANTS.
OWFER, I DO GET
20:34:30  A LITTLE BIT CONCERNED IF YOU HAVE A ONE YEAR GRANT, HOW
20:34:33  DO YOU GO BACK AFTER A YEAR AND TELL PEOPLE,
20:34:37  STORY, THE MONEY IS ALL GONE.
SO THERE NEEDS TO BE A SUSTAINABLE SOURCE
20:34:40  OF FUNDING, WHETHER THAT'S PHILANTHROPIC OR WHETHER
20:34:43  THAT'S COUNTY, STATE OR FEDERAL FUNDS.
I JUST
20:34:46  DON'T SEE CITIES AS A WHOLE HAVE
20:34:50 ING THAT CAPABILITY WITH THE LIMITED RESOURCES THAT THEY
20:34:53  HAVE ALREADY, AND THAT'S PRETTY MUCH THROUGHOUT THE  STATE.

20:35:00 SO UNFORTUNATELY AT THIS POINT, I WOULD NOT REALLY BE IN FAVOR OF
20:35:03  MOVING THIS FORWARD.
I THINK IF SOMEONE WANTED TO DO
20:35:07  THE OUTREACH
20:35:10  TO THESE PRIVATE COMPANIES AND SAY HEY,
20:35:14  CAN YOU ROUND UP A BUNCH OF DONOR
20:35:17 S?
IF THAT'S GOING TO PROVIDE THE FUNDING
20:35:20 , THAT WOULD BE THE BEST WAY FORWARD.

20:35:23 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU, COUNCILMEMBER JONES.
COUNCILMEMBER SHAO.

20:35:29 >> Councilmember Shao: THANK  YOU, MADAME MAYOR.
I'M VESSEL AGAINST
20:35:36  SPECIFICALLY AGAINST RUNNING A SMALL SCALE PROGRAM, A PILOT
20:35:39  PROGRAM BECAUSE IT'S DEFINITELY AN EQUITY
20:35:43  ISSUE.
THE PROGRAM IS TO COVER NOT ONLY THE
20:35:46  FOSTER KIDS, BUT FAMILIES
20:35:50  IN POVERTY, FAMILIES AT
20:35:54  RISK, FAMILIES THAT ARE BOUND TO BECOME HOME
20:35:58 LESS, SO WE'RE LOOKING
20:36:01  AT A HUGE GROUP OF POTENTIAL APPLICANTS
20:36:08 .
WHETHER YOU ADMIT SOMEONE TO
20:36:11  THIS PILOT SMALL SCALE PROGRAM
20:36:14  WHILE DENYING A MAJORITY OF THE AK
20:36:18  CAN'T -- TO ME, IT A SERIOUS EQUITY ISSUE.

20:36:21 AND IF WE WANT TO DO THINGS
20:36:25  RIGHT, YOU KNOW, BY OFFER
20:36:28 ING HELP TO THOSE PEOPLE, WE SHOULD DO IT IN THE CORRECT WAY
20:36:32 .

20:36:36 SO I ECHO COUNCILMEMBER JONES' PROPOSAL
20:36:41  THAT SINCE WE DO NOT HAVE
20:36:50  IDENTIFIED FUNDS AND STAFF TO RUN
20:36:54  SUCH A PROGRAM, I WOULD AT THIS TIME JUST NOT MOVE
20:36:57  FORWARD WITH THIS REFERRAL.

20:37:03 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU, COUNCILMEMBER SHAO.
VICE PRESIDENT SALWAN
20:37:06 VICE MAYOR
20:37:09  SALWAN.
>> Vice Mayor Salwan: THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR AND THANK YOU
20:37:13 , COUNCILMEMBER SHAO FOR BRINGING THIS DISCUSSION.

20:37:16 I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT DISCUSSION
20:37:19  TO BE HAD.

20:37:24 SUSTAINABILITY, IF THIS IS A PROGRAM
20:37:27  WE'RE GOING TO START, I'D LIKE
20:37:30  WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE IT.

20:37:33 THE SECOND PART I'M WORRIED ABOUT IS THE ADMINISTRATIVE ASPECT OF
20:37:36  RUNNING THIS PROGRAM.
AS WE ALL KNOW,
20:37:39  GOVERNMENT IS GOOD AT CERTAIN THINGS BUT PROGRAMS LIKE THESE CAN DEFINITELY
20:37:43  BE DRAINING ON RESOURCES.
SO I WOULD --
20:37:47  IF ANYONE WANTS TO EXPLORE THIS FURTHER,
20:37:50  I WOULD SAY WE NEED TO WORK EITHER WITH A NON-PROFIT OR
20:37:53  TRY AND GET OTHER COMMUNITY PARTNERS, THE COUNTY
20:37:57 , BUSINESSES, AND TRY TO CREATE KIND OF
20:38:00  A COMMUNITY  BUY-IN SO THAT WE HAVE
20:38:04  ONE WILLING PARTNER WILLING
20:38:07  TO TAKE IT ON, AND SECOND, AN
20:38:10  ONGOING, SUSTAINABLE MODEL.
SO I AM OPEN TO
20:38:13  SUPPORTING AB
20:38:17  AB65 OR GENERAL STATEMENTS OF SUPPORTING SUCH INITIATIVE
20:38:20 S.
BUT AS FAR AS COMMITTING GENERAL FUND DOLLARS
20:38:23 , I DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS.
THANK YOU.

20:38:29 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
COUNCILMEMBER KENG?

20:38:32 >> Councilmember Keng: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
SO I ACTUALLY
20:38:37  -- WOULD WE BE ABLE TO SUPPORT SOMETHING LIKE IF WE APPROACH
20:38:40 , SAY LIKE A LIST OF FIVE TO 10 POE
20:38:44  POTENTIAL DONORS AND I THINK EARLIER, YOU KNOW, WE
20:38:47  KIND OF RAN THE NUMBERS
20:38:50  OF DOING A SMALL PROGRAM OF $500 FOR
20:38:54  100 PEOPLE
20:38:58 , JUST LIKE COUNCILMEMBER SHAO WAS SAYING, THERE'S POTENTIALLY A
20:39:01  LARGE GROUP OF PEOPLE THAT NEEDS HELP, RIGHT, SO
20:39:06  I THINK A LOT OF CITIES ARE DOING KIND OF A LOTTERY SYSTEM
20:39:09 .
THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT NEEDS HELP, AND WE CAN HELP
20:39:12  THEM DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE DON'T DO ANYTHING, RIGHT?

20:39:16 SO IF WE --
20:39:19  SAY LIKE
20:39:22  THE
20:39:25  -- ANOTHER 600,000, THEN THE COST OF
20:39:29  1.2 MILLION GIVEN ALL THE BENEFITS THAT THE STAFF HAVE FOUND
20:39:33  TO KIND OF JUST EMAIL THOSE COMPANIES
20:39:36  TO SEE IF THEY POTENTIALLY ARE INTEREST
20:39:39 ED AND IF THEY ARE NOT, THEN WE
20:39:43  HAVE TRIED, RIGHT, BUT I THINK
20:39:46  WE HAVE LIKE
20:39:50  $1 MILLION FOR FACEBOOK IS LIKE A DROP IN THE BUCKET, RIGHT?
AND THEN FOR OAKLAND
20:39:53 , FOR EXAMPLE, THEY HAVE BEEN DOING
20:39:59  A PROGRAM AFTER THE FIRST SIX MONTHS, THEY ACTUALLY HAVE RECEIVE
20:40:02 ED MORE FUNDING TO CONTINUE TO INCREASE THE  FAMILIES THAT ARE RECEIVING THE
20:40:05  FUNDING AND TO MAKE IT A LONGER PROGRAM.

20:40:09 SO
20:40:13  I WOULD LIKE TO PROPOSE THAT AT LEAST WE HAVE TO -- IF WE START
20:40:17  WITH A NUMBER, THEN WE KNOW WHAT WE'RE WORKING WITH, RIGHT?

20:40:21 EARLIER THE STAFF HAVE ALREADY SAID TO HELP --
20:40:24  TO HAVE $500 A MONTH FOR ONE
20:40:27  YEAR COSTS $600,000.
I MEAN, WE
20:40:30  CAN PAVE A COUPLE STREETS
20:40:34  OR -- WE DO IMPROVEMENTS ALL THE TIME
20:40:37  THAT'S LIKE A MILLION DOLLARS AND
20:40:40  IT'S NOT IMPROVING -- DIRECTLY IMPACTING PEOPLE'S
20:40:44  LIVES, BUT THESE ARE LIFE-SAVING DOLLARS THAT EACH DOLLAR WILL BE USED TO THE
20:40:47  PEOPLE DIRECTLY.
SO
20:40:51  JUST AS THE STAFF HAD POINTED OUT, THE BENEFITS OF
20:40:54  THE SEED PROGRAM THAT THEY HAVE SEEN, I THINK IT'S
20:40:57  WORTH A SHOT THAT, YOU KNOW, IF WE JUST
20:41:01  SPEND -- I DON'T WANT
20:41:04  TO SPEND TOO MUCH TIME BUT IF YOU CAN
20:41:09  HAVE A LIST OF FIVE TO 10 COMPANIES THAT WE
20:41:12  CAN JUST SEND AN EMAIL TO AND IF THEY HAVE INTEREST TO HELP OUT
20:41:15 , THAT WOULD BE GREAT, RIGHT?

20:41:21 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
COUNCILMEMBER JONES?

20:41:25 >> Councilmember Jones: THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR.
AGAIN, I'M RELUCTANT
20:41:29  TO -- THESE ARE VERY STAFF-
20:41:32 INTENSIVE TYPES OF ISSUES TO DRIVE FORWARD.
THAT'S WHY I THINK MOST
20:41:35  OF THESE HAVE RELIED ON PRIVATE DONATIONS
20:41:39  AND AGAIN, WE DON'T HAVE THE STAFF
20:41:42  AVAILABLE FOR OUTSIDE PROJECTS SUCH AS
20:41:46  THIS FOR SOMETHING THAT WE
20:41:50  DON'T HAVE A SUSTAINABLE SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR.
SO I WOULD BE
20:41:53  RELUCTANT TO COMMIT AN INORDINATE AMOUNT OF STAFF TIME TO SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

20:41:56 I THINK IT WOULD BE SOMETHING BETTER TAKEN ON BY EITHER A NON-
20:41:59  NON-PROFIT OR SOMETHING TAKEN
20:42:03  TO THE COUNTY OR STATE LEVEL.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

20:42:06 COUNCILMEMBER COX.
>> Councilmember Cox: YES
20:42:09 , I WANTED TO REITERATE, THERE'S SOME GROUPS CALL
20:42:12 ED BEYOND EMANCIPATION THAT INVOLVES FOSTER
20:42:16  YOUTH THAT'S BASED OUT OF THE OAKLAND AREA BUT STEMS AROUND KIND OF COVERING
20:42:19  THE ENTIRE EAST BAY.
THOSE TYPE OF ORGANIZATIONS
20:42:22  COULD UTILIZE AND PARTNER WITH YOU,
20:42:26  FOR EXAMPLE, COUNCILMEMBER KENG, IN
20:42:29  TERMS OF FINDING WAYS TO HELP SUPPORT THEIR INITIATIVE
20:42:33  INITIATIVES AND DOING SO.

20:42:36 TO THINK THAT WE CAN, YOU KNOW, MAKE A CALL AND ASK FOR MONEY
20:42:39 , THERE'S A LOT OF OTHER OBLIGATIONS ON
20:42:43  AND THINGS THAT ARE TIED WITH THAT, AND WHAT I'M KIND OF
20:42:46  HEARING NOW IS A LITTLE BIT MORE ON SOME
20:42:49  SCOPE CREEP FROM WHAT WE HAD ORIGINALLY AGREED TO LOOKING
20:42:53  AT FUNDING SOURCES, PRESENTING THE RESEARCH
20:42:57  INFORMATION, BUT TO SAY THE NEXT STEP,
20:43:00  THAT KIND OF CHANGES WHAT YOUR REFERRAL WAS ORIGINALLY INTENDED
20:43:04  FOR.
AND SO
20:43:09  I THINK IT'S A GREAT  IDEA, I
20:43:12  HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING, BUT THERE IS A LOT OF ORGANIZATIONS
20:43:17  THAT I COULD PUT YOU IN TOUCH WITH, WITH THE
20:43:20  FOSTER YOUTH, THAT YOU COULD WORK WITH DIRECTLY TO HELP THEIR CAUSE BECAUSE A LOT
20:43:24  OF THEM, THEY DON'T HAVE FOOD, I MEAN, I'M PART OF ORGANIZATIONS
20:43:28  WHERE WE RAISE MONEY TO HELP THEM GO TO COLLEGE, GIVE
20:43:32  COLLEGE SCHOLARSHIPS.
THEY ALSO FALL UNDER
20:43:35  OHLONE COLLEGE WHICH WOULD BE UNDER THE EO
20:43:38 PS, WHICH IS EQUAL OPPORTUNITY PROGRAM, WHERE YOU'RE TALKING
20:43:42  THOSE THAT CAN'T EVEN AFFORD TO BUY BOOKS OR SHOES
20:43:45 , AND THEY FIND WAYS AT OHLONE COLLEGE TO
20:43:49  PROVIDE THAT TYPE OF OPPORTUNITY OF EDUCATION
20:43:52  AND GETTING OTHER THINGS TAKEN
20:43:56  CARE OF AS THEY GO TO SCHOOL.
SO THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT AVENUE
20:43:59 S.
I THINK THAT WE'RE MISSING OUT IN TERMS OF
20:44:02  THE SCOPE AND WHAT WAS REQUESTED ORIGINALLY AND
20:44:05  YOUR INTENT.
THE SECOND PART IS
20:44:09  ALSO THAT AS WE SET THE PRIORITIES THIS PAST YEAR
20:44:12 , WE'RE KIND OF KEEPING IN LINE WITH WHAT WE SAID IS THE PRIORITIES
20:44:17  OF THE COUNCIL TO BE CARRIED OUT AND BE
20:44:20  ALIGNED WITH RIGHT NOW, AND I THINK THAT THERE'S SOME THINGS
20:44:24  THAT WE DO AS COUNCILMEMBERS THAT WE
20:44:27  HELP OUR COMMUNITY.
I
20:44:31  THINK THAT THE FOCUS WITH US NOT EVEN HEARING WHAT OUR
20:44:34  PROFILE WOULD NOT MATCH TO GET THE GRANTS THAT OTHER
20:44:37  CITIES COULD GET BECAUSE
20:44:41  OUR PROFILE IS NOT ALIGNED WITH WHAT THE CRITERIA IS
20:44:45 , AND ALSO I AM TOO CONCERNED ABOUT THE
20:44:48  LONGEVITY THAT I DON'T BELIEVE IN PUTTING SOMEONE IN, BECAUSE SOME
20:44:51  OF THESE PROGRAMS ARE ONLY ONE OR TWO YEARS.
WELL, IT'S
20:44:54  NOT RIGHT THAT ONE OR TWO YEARS, THERE'S
20:44:58  SOMEBODY BACK WHEN WE DON'T HAVE MONEY
20:45:01 S TO SUSTAIN THEM.
AND I THINK WE'VE GOT TO BE REAL
20:45:04  CAREFUL ON VALUING THE PROCESS AND VALUE
20:45:07 ING HOW WE TAKE PEOPLE THROUGH TRAINING TO GET TO THE
20:45:10  NEXT LEVEL, BUT WE WANT THEM TO BE ABLE TO SUSTAIN THEMSELVES
20:45:15 , AND
20:45:18  WE'VE DONE A LOT OF GREAT WORK AS MENTIONED EARLIER WITH THE RENTAL
20:45:21  ASSISTANCE AND ALSO WITH SOME OF THE THINGS THAT ARE COMING
20:45:25  ABOUT, HELPING THROUGHOUT DIFFERENT COUNT
20:45:28 IES ON GETTING PEOPLE INTO HOTELS.
I KNOW
20:45:31  I WORK DIRECTLY IN THOSE TYPE OF ARENAS
20:45:35  FOR SUPPORTIVE HOUSING THAT CAN HELP PEOPLE
20:45:38  FIND PATHS TO COME OUT OF THEIR SITUATION.
BUT
20:45:41  I THINK I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE
20:45:46  SCOPE CREEP THAT'S OCCURRING RIGHT NOW WITH WHAT OUR ORIGINAL
20:45:49  INTENT OF LOOKING AT THIS REFERRAL
20:45:53 , AND I'D
20:45:57  PREFER NOT TO BE ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD ANY FURTHER WITH
20:46:00  THIS BECAUSE THE INTENT WAS JUST TO DO RESEARCH, AND TO
20:46:03  FIND OUT WHAT WERE THE RESOURCES OF GRANTS
20:46:06  THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO SUPPORT
20:46:10  -- WHETHER IT'S THE CASH TRANSFER OR
20:46:14  UNIVERSAL BASIC INCOME, ALL OF THOSE TYPE OF PROGRAMS FOR
20:46:17   HELPING THE FOSTER YOUTH AND CERTAINLY WITH
20:46:20  THE BILL BEING STUCK IN THE APPROPRIATION COMMITTEE RIGHT NOW
20:46:23 , THERE IS CONCERN THAT IT MAY NOT BE OUT
20:46:26  FOR A WHILE.
YOU KNOW, BECAUSE
20:46:29  THERE'S A LOT OF OTHER MEASURES THAT IT HAS TO GO
20:46:33  THROUGH TO GET THOSE TYPE OF BILLS
20:46:36  FINALIZED AND RESOLVED AND APPROVED IN ASSEMBLY.
SO I
20:46:39  THINK THAT RIGHT NOW, I THINK THAT WE
20:46:43  HAVE A LOT ON OUR PLATE.

20:46:46 I THINK THIS IS SOME OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU, WITH THE
20:46:49  INFORMATION THAT'S BEEN PRESENTED, THAT MAYBE THERE'S SOME
20:46:52  THINGS YOU COULD PARTNER WITH OTHER
20:46:55  ORGANIZATIONS LIKE EMANCIPATION
20:46:59  EMANCIPATION -- I'M SORRY -- BEYOND EMANCIPATION.
THEY'RE BASED
20:47:02  OUT OF OAKLAND AND THEY DEAL DIRECTLY WITH FOSTER
20:47:05  YOUTH.
ONE OF PIE ORGANIZATIONS I'M AFFILIATED WITH, WE
20:47:12 ONE OF MY ORGANIZATIONS I'M AFFILIATED WITH, WE HELP WITH TRAINING
20:47:16  BUT THAT'S SUSTAINED BY A NON-PROFIT THAT I'M INVOLVED IN.
SO THINK
20:47:19  ABOUT THAT IN TERMS OF SOME OTHER THINGS TO
20:47:22  LOOK AT, IN TERMS OF PARTNER, BUT I THINK TO
20:47:25  ASK THE STAFF TO MAKE CALLS TO FACEBOOK AND THINGS
20:47:28 , I THINK THAT GETS INTO SOME CONFLICTS OF INTEREST, AND
20:47:32  SOME AVENUES THAT
20:47:35  WERE NOT SET UP NECESSARILY TO REPRESENT THE
20:47:38  CITY IN THE PROPER WAY OF MANAGING OUR
20:47:41  STAFF TIME AND EFFORTS, AND ALSO IT'S NOT
20:47:44  DIRECTLY IN LINE WITH WHAT WE AGREED TO AS OUR PRIORITIES
20:47:48  AS CITY COUNCIL FOR THIS PAST YEAR.

20:47:52 AND THE SCOPE.
THE SCOPE HAS CHANGED FROM WHAT WE START
20:47:56 ED BACK ON NOVEMBER 2ND TO WHAT YOU'RE ASKING
20:47:59  NOW.
SO I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THAT.

20:48:03 AND UTILIZING OUR STAFF TO DO THESE
20:48:06  ADDITIONAL FACT-
20:48:09 FINDING OR REACHING OUT, WHICH IS KIND OF, TO ME
20:48:12 , IT'S FUNDRAISING.
IT'S REALLY FUNDRAISING
20:48:16  INITIATIVES THAT ARE NOT QUITE IN LINE WITH WHAT WAS INITIALLY
20:48:19  ASKED ABOUT THIS REQUEST.

20:48:23 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU, COUNCILMEMBER COX.
I
20:48:27  WOULD CONCUR WITH SOME OF YOUR STATEMENTS.
I ALSO WANTED TO NOTE
20:48:30 , WE DID AS A TAXPAYER, AND AS A COMMUNITY, STEP FORWARD AND
20:48:34  SAY THAT MAKING SOME
20:48:37  BOLD MOVES.
WE HAVE THE HOMELESS NAVIGATION CENTER
20:48:40 , THE CLEAN START MOBIL HYGIENE, WE HAVE
20:48:43  OUR SAFE START THIS YEAR COMING UP.
THE BIGGEST FUNDING MEASURE
20:48:46  I THINK ABSOLUTELY WE WOULD SUPPORT AND I THINK AS -- WHEN WE
20:48:49  TALK ABOUT UPDATING OUR LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES AND PRINCIPLES, THAT'S AN
20:48:52  OPPORTUNITY AT OUR RETREAT TO COMMIT TO THAT, AND
20:48:55  AS THE TAXPAYERS AND
20:48:58  COMMUNITY AND COUNTYWIDE, WE DID VOTE TO SUPPORT
20:49:01  MEASURE W, WHICH IS CURRENTLY TRIED
20:49:04  TIED UP IN
20:49:08  LITIGATION BUT THAT HALF A% IS A
20:49:11  TAX FOR THOSE EXPERIENCING
20:49:14  JOB TRAINING, SOCIAL SAFETY NET AND OTHER GENERAL FUNDING
20:49:17  SERVICES, AND THAT HAS THE IMPLEMENTATION AND PROCESS
20:49:21  BY WHICH ONCE THE FUNDING SHOULD BECOME AVAILABLE, WE'D BE ABLE TO
20:49:23  USE THAT, AND THAT'S WHAT'S PART OF, AGAIN,
20:49:27  WHAT OUR COMMUNITY SERVICES DIRECTOR SUZANNE
20:49:31  AND SEVERAL OF THE OTHER CITIES OR MAYORS HAVE BEEN
20:49:34  HAVING A WORKING GROUP THAT HAS BEEN WORKING IN CONCERT WITH THE COUNTY AND THAT'S
20:49:37  WHY WE HAD A MEETING YESTERDAY WITH THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS TO TALK ABOUT THE
20:49:41  NEXT STEPS AND ACTUALLY COMING BACK TO US IN FEBRUARY, I
20:49:44  THINK PART OF IT IS HOW WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO PIVOT AND WITH PROJECT
20:49:47 S LIKE THE ISLANDER MOTEL, WHERE IT WAS SUPPOSED TO
20:49:50  BE ONLY BUILT AND TEMPORARY FOR LOW INCOME HOUSING.

20:49:53 WE'VE APPLIED AND USED OUR
20:49:57  42 MILLIONS OF NOFA FUNDING FOR THREE
20:50:00  AFFORDABLE HOUSING  PROJECTS BUT THE ISLANDER
20:50:03  MOTEL DURING THIS TIME PERIOD WHILE WAITING FOR THE FINANCING
20:50:06  TO PRO SE WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO SERVE OVER 70 INDIVIDUALS.
IF
20:50:10  I REMEMBER CORRECTLY, ABOUT
20:50:14  68% OF THEM HAVE BEEN REHOUSED.
BUT THOSE ARE WAY
20:50:18 S -- I APOLOGIZE, MY LIGHT
20:50:21  KEEPS TURNING OFF WHEN I'M NOT  MOVING -- TO USE FUNDING
20:50:24  TO ADDRESS THIS:  THAT'S WORKING IN CONCERT WITH
20:50:28  THE COUNTY, WITH THE FEDERAL AND STATE TO ADDRESS THE FUNDING POOL AND
20:50:31  IT HAS A MECHANISM BY WHICH OBVIOUSLY CITIES CAN ADMINISTER
20:50:34  THIS BECAUSE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THEY'RE COUNTING ON THE CITIES TO PARTNER
20:50:37  WITH.
AND THAT WILL BE COMING TO US IN A PRESENTATION IN FEBRUARY FROM THE
20:50:41  COUNTY.
AND I KNOW THAT'S SOMETHING WE'LL BE LOOKING AT
20:50:44  IN A MORE HOLISTIC APPROACH IN TERMS
20:50:47  OF THE HOUSING, IN TERMS OF THE COMMUNITY SERVICES.
BECAUSE THE POINT
20:50:50  IN TIME, THE NUMBER ONE THING WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE HELPING OUT
20:50:54  AND THE POINT IN TIME THAT COUNCILMEMBER JONES REFERENCED,
20:50:57  IN 2017, WE HAD 445 MEMBERS AND IN
20:51:00  2019, WE COUNTED 608 AND WE SKIPPED
20:51:04  THIS YEAR BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC, BUT THIS JANUARY 25TH,
20:51:07  WE'LL BE DOING IT AGAIN.
SO WE REALLY DO NEED THE PEOPLE AND THE RESOURCES
20:51:10  OF OUR STAFF AND ALL OF THOSE TO BE ABLE TO ACCURATELY COUNT
20:51:13  THAT, BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THE FUNDING THEN IS DIRECTLY TIED TO
20:51:17  THAT  CORALLIZATION IN TERMS OF HOW MANY INDIVIDUALS ARE THERE
20:51:20  ATTRIBUTED.
THAT'S WHAT THE COUNTY AND THE FEDERAL AND STATE LEVEL
20:51:23  ARE GOING TO BE LOOKING AT HOW THEY DECIDE TO ALLOCATE FUNDING
20:51:26 S.
SO FOR ME, I FEEL ABSOLUTELY WE ARE
20:51:29  DEDICATED TO SERVING THIS COMMUNITY WHICH IS WHY
20:51:33  WE'RE GOING TO PUT FULL RESOURCE
20:51:36  BECAUSE THAT'S IS A MEASUREMENT IN TERMS OF HOW THEY DECIDE,
20:51:39  AND ALSO IN THE POLICIES WE'RE LOOKING AT, WHETHER IT'S RACIAL JUSTICE,
20:51:43  THERE'S A RACIAL LENS ASPECT WHEN WE LOOKED
20:51:46  AT HOW THIS IS GOING TO BE APPLIED IN TERMS OF EQUITY.
SO
20:51:49  FOR ME, I THINK THAT'S WHERE I'D LIKE TO PUT THE FOCUS.

20:51:52 ABSOLUTELY WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS BUT SEEING THAT WE DON'T HAVE THE STAFFING
20:51:55  AT THIS TIME, AND WE CAN TALK ABOUT THIS ALSO AT OUR COUNCIL RETREAT BECAUSE
20:51:58  EVERY YEAR IN ADDITION TO OUR LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES AND PRINCIPLES, WE ALSO
20:52:02  TALK ABOUT OUR TOP THREE GOALS, AND HOMELESSNESS IS
20:52:05  DEFINITELY ONE OF THOSE IN OUR LAST YEAR'S DISCUSSION.
SO COUNCILMEMBER KENG,
20:52:08  DO YOU HAVE OTHER COMMENTS ON THAT?

20:52:14 >> Councilmember Keng: YES, THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR, THANK YOU, MOST OF THE COUNCIL,
20:52:17  ACTUALLY I THINK I HEARD MOST OF YOUR SUPPORT
20:52:20  ON THE IDEA OF THIS PROGRAM, RIGHT, IS TO HELP OUR MOST
20:52:23  VULNERABLE, AND I THINK
20:52:29  PROBABLY SOME OF YOU WERE NOT AS FAMILIAR WITH THE IDEA OF GUARANTEE
20:52:32 ED INCOME OR UBI.
NOT JUST TO HELP
20:52:36  PEOPLE WHEN THEY'RE ALREADY ON THE STREET, IT GETS -- YOU KNOW,
20:52:39  WE SAW HOW EXPENSIVE IT IS AND LIKE LESS EFFECTIVE
20:52:44 , THEN TO PREVENT PEOPLE FROM FALLING INTO  HOMELESSNESS.
SO THIS
20:52:47  IS THE PROGRAM THAT, YOU KNOW, THAT
20:52:50  PEOPLE ARE CURRENTLY HOUSED, SO I MEAN, THERE'S
20:52:53  DIFFERENT THINGS AND -- BUT I'M JUST SEE
20:52:56 ING FROM THE STAFF RESEARCH
20:53:00 , WE DID SEE THAT, YOU KNOW, THEY
20:53:03  CONCLUDE THAT THIS PROGRAM IS BENEFICIAL BUT WE'RE JUST LACKING
20:53:07  THE FUNDING.
BUT I APPRECIATE YOUR FEEDBACK, YOUR INPUTS
20:53:10 , AND WE CAN WORK WITH THE
20:53:14  COUNTY GETTING MORE FUNDING
20:53:17  ON DIFFERENT PROGRAMS.
SO I GUESS,
20:53:20  YOU KNOW, WE CAN ALSO APPRECIATE COUNCILMEMBER
20:53:24  COX'S INPUT
20:53:27  ON BEYOND EMANCIPATION AND ALSO
20:53:30  COUNCILMEMBER JONES'
20:53:34  INPUT ON WORKING WITH THE COUNTY.
I
20:53:37  THINK I WOULD AT LEAST TRY TO SEE IF WE CAN WORK WITH THE COUNTY ON
20:53:40  GETTING SOME OF THOSE 25 --
20:53:44  $35 MILLION FUNDING AS A COUNTY TOGETHER
20:53:47 .
SO I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT PROBABLY
20:53:50  IT'S MORE FEASIBLE
20:53:54  AT THIS POINT, NOT CUTTING INTO UR OH OWN BUDGET OR HURTING OUR
20:53:57  EXISTING PROGRAMS.
ALSO APPRECIATE
20:53:59  COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN'S SUPPORT.
THAT'S ALL.
THANK YOU.

20:54:04 >> Mayor Mei: COUNCILMEMBER JONES.

20:54:09 >> Councilmember Jones: I'M NOT SURE IF COUNCILMEMBER KENG IS WITHDRAWING HER REFERRAL OR
20:54:12  IF WE --
>> Mayor Mei: I THINK WE NEED TO
20:54:15  MAKE A MOTION ON THIS IN TERMS OF COMMENTS.
I THINK WE HAVE SOME
20:54:18  UNDERSTANDING, BUT AT LEAST GO AHEAD
20:54:22  AND MAKE YOURS, WHICH I THINK IS THAT WE ABSOLUTELY SUPPORT THE IDEA
20:54:25  BUT WE DON'T SEE THE FUNDING AND AT THIS
20:54:28  POINT --
>> Councilmember Keng: SO I THINK
20:54:31  SOMETHING DOABLE AND FEASIBLE IS TO PARTNER WITH THE COUNTY
20:54:35  TO APPLY FOR THE
20:54:39  CALIFORNIA BILL 153 FOR THAT FUNDING THAT'S
20:54:43  ALREADY  AVAILABLE, AND AS A CITY, WE DON'T HAVE A COUNT
20:54:46  OF HOW MANY FOSTER KIDS WE HAVE, BUT AS A
20:54:49  COUNTY, THEY HAVE AT THE COUNTY THERE,
20:54:52  THEN WE CAN --
>> Mayor Mei: JUST TO CLARIFY, WHEN
20:54:55  THE BILL PASSES IN THE
20:54:59  ADMINISTRATION AND OPPORTUNITY IS AVAILABLE, OUR CITY HAS ALWAYS APPLIED FOR
20:55:01  ANY FUNDING THAT WE THINK THAT WE'RE QUALIFIED FOR, AND
20:55:05  I COUNT ON OUR HUMAN SERVICES DIRECTOR
20:55:10 , COMMUNITY SERVICES DIRECTOR SUZANNE SHENFIL AND
20:55:13  THE TEAM TO BE ABLE TO APPLY FOR THOSE.
SO I'M NOT SURE IF THERE'S A
20:55:16  REFERRAL NEEDED --
>> Councilmember Keng: RIGHT, SO SINCE WE'RE ON
20:55:19  THIS REFERRAL, WE CAN CONCLUDE TO DIRECT STAFF WITH THAT NEXT
20:55:23  STEP.
BECAUSE YOU HAD JUST SAID THAT WE ALWAYS DO, RIGHT
20:55:27 , THEN WHAT'S THE -- WHY DO WE NOT?
>> Mayor Mei: WE DON'T NEED
20:55:30  A REFERRAL FOR THAT BECAUSE THAT'S ALREADY PART OF THEIR JOB ALREADY.
THEY APPLY
20:55:33  FOR EVERY GRANT PROGRAM THAT WE ARE ELIGIBLE FOR APPLY
20:55:36 ING FOR AND QUALIFIED FOR.
I WOULD DEFER
20:55:39  TO OUR CITY MANAGER OR
20:55:42  OUR CITY COUNCIL IN TERMS OF OUR LEGAL
20:55:46  COUNSEL, BUT I DON'T THINK WE NEED A REFERRAL ON THAT.

20:55:49 >> Councilmember Keng: I BELIEVE -- I'M SORRY TO CORRECT YOU, MAYOR,
20:55:52  BUT I BELIEVE BEFORE I BROUGHT THIS ON, THE STAFF WAS NOT AWARE
20:55:56  THAT THIS BILL WAS OUT THERE OR THIS FUNDING
20:55:59  WAS OUT THERE.
SO I THINK WE
20:56:02  COULD GO AHEAD AND MAKE THAT.
>> Mayor Mei: I WOULD DISAGREE.
I'M SURE OUR
20:56:05  STAFF -- BECAUSE WE DO HAVE LEGISLATIVE UPDATES COMING
20:56:09  REGULARLY FROM TOWNS LOCALLY IN
20:56:12  SACRAMENTO AS WELL AS THE FEDERAL LEVEL, SO WE DON'T NEED TO HAVE A
20:56:15  REFERRAL THAT  ASKS US TO APPLY FOR SOMETHING THAT OUR STAFF WAS ALREADY WORKING
20:56:17  ON.
BECAUSE THEY CONTINUALLY SEEK FUNDING FOR US.

20:56:21 CITY MANAGER SHACKELFORD, DO YOU THINK THERE'S A NEED FOR A REFERRAL
20:56:25  TO ASK STAFF TO APPLY FOR GRANTS THAT WE ARE ELIGIBLE FOR
20:56:27 ?
>>
>> City Mgr. Shackelford: I JUST WANT 
20:56:31 TO CLARIFY THAT IN THE EVENT THAT THERE ARE
20:56:34  GRANT OPPORTUNITIES FOR US TO APPLY FOR
20:56:37 , WE PURSUE THOSE JUST
20:56:40  AS A MATTER OF OUR NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS.
HOWEVER, IF
20:56:45  THERE ARE SOME MATCHING FUNDS THAT ARE
20:56:48  REQUIRED AS PART OF THAT GRANT APPLICATION OR
20:56:51  ADDITIONAL STAFF RESOURCES, THAT'S SOMETHING
20:56:55  THAT WE BRING BEFORE YOU ALL
20:56:59  FOR CONSIDERATION.
SO
20:57:03  ANY GRANT OPPORTUNITY OUT THERE THAT WE FEEL IS BENEFICIAL
20:57:06  TO US AND OUR CORE SERVICES, WE DO
20:57:09  ACTIVELY PURSUE.

20:57:15 >> Mayor Mei: COUNCILMEMBER JONES, I SEE YOUR HAND RAISED.
>> Councilmember Jones: MADAME MAYOR,
20:57:19  I AM READY FOR A MOTION.
>> Mayor Mei: GO AHEAD
20:57:21 .
>> Councilmember Jones: SO BASED ON THE COMMENTS THAT I'VE HEARD FROM THE 
20:57:24 MAJORITY OF THE  COUNCIL, I WOULD MOVE THAT WE DO NOT
20:57:27  EXTEND ANY STAFF RESOURCES RESEARCHING THIS PARTICULAR ITEM
20:57:31  FURTHER.
AND PARTNER WITH THE COUNTY AND
20:57:34  AND/OR THE STATE OR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
20:57:38  FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ANY FUTURE PROGRAMS.

20:57:43 >> Councilmember Shao: I SECOND.
>> Mayor Mei: MOTION BY COUNCILMEMBER JONES AND
20:57:47  SECOND BY COUNCILMEMBER SHAO.
ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE.

20:57:54 >> Ms. Gauthier: COUNCILMEMBER COX, AYE.

20:58:20 THANK YOU.
JUST TO CLARIFY
20:58:24 , WE ARE GOING TO GET AN UPDATED REPORT ON HOMELESS
20:58:27 NESS, AND SUZANNE, I KNOW THAT
20:58:32  THERE ARE WEEKLY UPDATES AS WELL AS THE ONES COMING
20:58:35  FROM THE COUNTY, WE WILL BE ACTIVELY PURSUING ALL OPTIONS
20:58:38  AND SOURCES AS WELL AS OUR  SPORKPOINT AND OTHER LEGAL REMEDIES AS WELL AS
20:58:42  WORKING WITH OUR DIRECTORS
20:58:45  OF ECONOMIC DEVELOP
20:58:48 MENT, AND WE WORK CLOSELY WITH OHLONE AND WE HOPE TO CONTINUE
20:58:52  THAT PROGRAM OR FOSTER THOSE KINDS OF NEXT OPPORTUNITIES.

20:58:55 ARE THERE ANY ORAL REPORTS ON MEETINGS OR EVENTS THAT HAVE HAPPENED
20:58:59  THIS WEEK FROM THE COUNCIL IN TERMS OF THEIR MEETINGS?

20:59:03 I KNOW THAT YOU REPRESENT US ON SO MANY DIFFERENT COMMISSIONS AND COMMITTEE
20:59:06 S SUCH AS HOUSING AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND OTHERS, SO IF THERE'S ANYTHING
20:59:09  YOU'D LIKE TO SHARE.
FROM YOUR MEETINGS.

20:59:16 COUNCILMEMBER SHAO.
>> Councilmember Shao: THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR.

20:59:20 WE JUST HAD OUR MONTHLY ALAMEDA COUNTY HOUSING AUTHORITY
20:59:23   MEETING, WHICH BASICALLY UPDATE
20:59:27 ED OUR ANNUAL BUDGET
20:59:30  AS WELL AS OUR FUTURE OUTLOOKS.

20:59:33 IN TERMS OF NUNDING
20:59:37 , THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN CUTTING
20:59:41  THE FUNDING GRADUAL LIE,
20:59:44  SO WE FACE MORE CHALLENGES IN HONOR
20:59:47 ING VOUCHERS AND THEN PROVIDING HOUSING
20:59:51  TO OUR NEED
20:59:55 Y POPULATION
20:59:58  IN ALAMEDA COUNTY, BUT ON THE OTHER HAND, WE ALSO HAVE GOOD NEWS REGARD
21:00:01 ING THE PROGRAM WHERE WE
21:00:05  PROVIDE THAT TRAINING AS WELL AS SCHOLARSHIPS FOR TENANTS
21:00:09 .
WE CALL IT FFS PROGRAM
21:00:12 , AND THIS YEAR WAS AGAIN, WE SEE
21:00:18  HUGE PROGRESS MADE BY ALL THE PARTICIPANTS IN THIS PROGRAM.
SOME OF THEM RECEIVE
21:00:22 ED DEGREES, SOME OF THEM FUND JOBS
21:00:25 , SO IT IS EXCITING
21:00:28  JUST TO SEE THAT THE TENANTS ARE ALSO DOING
21:00:31  THEIR BEST TO
21:00:34  HELP THEMSELVES WHILE RECEIVING HELP FROM THE GOVERNMENT.

21:00:38 AND WE HAD
21:00:41  THE ANNUAL DRIVE
21:00:44  FOR POISE AND
21:00:50  TOYS AND OTHER CHRISTMAS GIFTS AMONG
21:00:54  THE COMMISSIONERS JUST TO HELP ALL THOSE NEEDY FAMILIES.
THAT'S ALL.

21:01:29  
TEAM OF US, A LOT OF US
21:01:32  FOIBLE

BUT IT MEANS
21:01:35  SOMETHING TO HAVE 
AFFORDABLE HOUSING WHERE PEOPLE 
CAN
21:01:38  LIVE IN THE COMMUNITY AND BE 
ABILITY TO WORK OR PLAY.
THAT MEANT
21:01:41  SO MUCH IN HAVING
