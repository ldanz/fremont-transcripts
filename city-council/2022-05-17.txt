19:13:46  AND MOTIVATED BY PHEBE YAS,  FEARS

19:14:54  THE SERVICES.

I WANTED TO
19:22:41  VOICE MY CONCERNS REGARDING THE SAFE PARKING PROGRAM THAT IS ABOUT TO BE
19:22:44  IMPLEMENTED IN JUNE AT THE CHRIST
19:22:47  THE KING CHURCH.
THIS
19:22:51  PROGRAM -- ENHANCE SAFETY MEASURE, I TRULY
19:22:54  BELIEVE IT WILL HAVE NEGATIVE IMPACTS TO THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITIES AND ALSO TO
19:22:57  THE ONES FOR WHICH THE PROGRAM IS INTENDED FOR.
WE
19:23:01  HAD THE CHANCE TO TALK TO CITY COUNCILMEMBER JENNY KASSAN FROM
19:23:05  DISTRICT 3 AND HEARD THE DESIGN FOR THIS
19:23:08  PROGRAM WAS  BASED ON THE DATA WHICH IS MORE THAN THREE YEARS
19:23:11  OLD, AND WITH
19:23:15  INCREASED CRIME IN  DISTRICT 3 AND THE SHINN NEIGHBORHOOD
19:23:18  RECENTLY, I ASKED THE CITY OF FREMONT AND OUR ELECTED OFFICIALS
19:23:21  TO CONSIDER THE PROGRAM -- AND MEASUREMENTS.
THE CURRENT
19:23:24  SETUP, THE LACK OF CONSIDERATION IS TO
19:23:27  PARTICIPANTS NEARBY SCHOOLS FOR LITTLE KIDS,
19:23:33  SENIOR HOMES AND NEARBY COMMUNITIES.
WE
19:23:36  DID REQUEST CAMERAS TO BE INSTALLED,
19:23:39  -- AT THE PARTICIPATING SITE TO ENSURE
19:23:44  IT'S ONLY PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS GOING IN AND OUT AND INCREASED
19:23:47  PATROLS FOR THE NEIGHBORHOOD.
THESE ARE ALL LOGICAL SAFETY MEASURES THAT WE
19:23:50  HAVE RESEARCHED IN OTHER PROGRAMS, AND
19:23:55  THEY HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED.
BUT PLEASE CONSIDER THEM,
19:23:58  AND WE ARE IN FAVOR OF JUST MAKING SURE
19:24:02  THAT THIS PROGRAM IS SAFE FOR
19:24:05  BOTH THE PARTICIPANTS AND THE COMMUNITY THAT SURROUNDS WHERE THIS PROGRAM
19:24:08  IS BEING IMPLEMENTED.
THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:24:12 NEXT SPEAKER IS RAY.

19:24:21 >> YES, CAN YOU HEAR ME OKAY?
>> Mayor Mei: YES.
>>
19:24:24  OKAY, GREAT.
HI, MY NAME IS RAY BOB.
19:24:28 BIT, I AM THE BROTHER OF
19:24:31  BELOVED CAPTAIN FREDDIE BOBBIT
19:24:35 .
TODAY I HAND DELIVERED A LETTER TO THE JOB
19:24:38 .
I'M HERE TO PUBLICLY DEMAND THE IMMEDIATE RESIGNATION OF MAYOR
19:24:41  LILY MEI AND HER IMMEDIATE WITHDRAWAL FROM THE CALIFORNIA
19:24:45  SENATE RACE.
THE MAYOR HAS FOSTERED A CULTURE OF COVER
19:24:48 UP AND CORRUPTION IN THE CITY.
FREMONT IS NOW KNOWN FOR  COVERING THE
19:24:51  TRUTH WHILE IT PREACHES HAPPINESS, TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY
19:24:54 .
THE MAYOR WAS BUSY ENGAGED AND DISTRACTED IN PERSONAL
19:24:57  RELATIONSHIPS WHILE THIS MAN RAN RAMPANT.

19:25:00 MYSELF AND A COMMITTEE OF MULTICULTURAL LEADERS AND ORGANIZER
19:25:04 S ARE ORGANIZING A TOWN HALL MEDIA EVENT TO
19:25:07  PROVIDE FACTS TO THE PUBLIC TO SUPPORT THE NEED
19:25:10  FOR YOUR IMMEDIATE RESIGNATION.
SHE HAS NO BUSINESS IN A ROLE
19:25:14  OF LEADERSHIP AND FINALLY, THOSE THAT WOULD SUGGEST THAT
19:25:17  MY CONTINUED FIGHT TO HOLD FREMONT OFFICIALS ACCOUNTABLE
19:25:20  COULD IMPACT OR TARNISH THE LEGACY OF MY BROTHER
19:25:23  SHOULD BE SEEN AS THE SPECIFIC INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE FEAR
19:25:27 FUL THAT THEY THEMSELVES COULD BE IMPACTED
19:25:30  AS THE FACTS COME OUT.
GOVERNMENT LEADERS TYPICALLY LIKE
19:25:33  TO BOAST ABOUT HOLDING PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE.
BUT THEY
19:25:36  ARE VERY UNCOMFORTABLE BEING HELD ACCOUNTABLE THEMSELVES.

19:25:41 I WILL HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE ON BEHALF OF MY GREAT BROTHER.
HE WAS A
19:25:44  GREAT LEADER WHO WAS LOVED BY EVERYONE, AND HE WAS LOVE
19:25:48 ED AND HE LOVED EVERYONE.
HOWEVER, HE WAS OPENLY
19:25:52  RETALIATED AGAINST AND DISCRIMINATED AGAINST WHILE THE MAYOR DID
19:25:55  ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.
MAYOR MEI, PLEASE RESIGN
19:25:59 .
IF YOU ARE SUCCESSFUL AT YOUR RACE AT THE SENATE, WE WILL FIGHT FOR
19:26:02  YOUR RECALL.
YOU NEED TO SELF-EVALUATE AND SEARCH
19:26:05  FOR THE TRUTH IN YOUR FAITH AND I WILL NOT STOP FIGHTING
19:26:08  UNTIL JUSTICE IS SERVED FOR FRED BOBBIT
19:26:12 T.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
NEXT
19:26:16  IS HARI IY
19:26:19 ER.

19:26:25 HARI, THANK YOU.

19:26:28 >> CAN YOU HEAR ME?

19:26:33 >> Mayor Mei: YES.
>> Ms. Gauthier: YOUR TIMER IS STARTING.

19:26:36 >> THIS IS REGARDING THE
19:26:39  415 -- CALLS IN DISTRICT 3.
FOR CONTEXT
19:26:42 , 415 -- CALLS INVOLV
19:26:46 ING HOMELESS AND  DISTRICT 3 IS WHERE THE SAFE PARKING
19:26:49  PROGRAM AND CHRIST KING
19:26:52  CHURCH IS LOCATED.
I'M FULLY IN SUPPORT OF
19:26:55  WHAT  D.K. SPOKE WITH EARLIER.
I WAS LISTENING TO THE WEBINAR
19:26:58  FROM THE POLICE DEPARTMENT, AND THERE WAS A SENSE
19:27:01  OF --
19:27:05  REDUCTION IN THE 415H CALLS THAT COME FROM DISTRICT
19:27:09  3.
 -- FUNNY THING.

19:27:12 I DON'T THINK YOU NEED A -- FOR REDUCING
19:27:15  THE COUNT OF THESE  HOMELESS DISCIPLINE CALL
19:27:18 S BY 50.
WE LOCAL RESIDENTS INCLUDING ME
19:27:22  DON'T EXPERIENCE -- OF
19:27:25  50 CALLS ON A 4% REDUCTION AS YOU PUT IT IN YOUR REPORTS.

19:27:28 WE DON'T -- IT'S KIND OF  LAUGHABLE FOR US.
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE
19:27:30 .
WE DON'T EXPERIENCE HOMELESS CALLS LIKE THAT.

19:27:34 LET'S ACTUALLY DO SOME MATH.

19:27:37 THERE WERE 1209, ONE THOWL
19:27:44  1209 CALLS IN
19:27:47  2021 AND -- CALLS IN 2020.

19:27:50 THAT'S --
19:27:53  MAYBE LEAP YEAR, 731.

19:27:57 2468 DIVIDED BY 73 1-RBGS ROUGHLY 3.5 CALLS A DAY
19:28:00 .
LET THAT SINK IN.
3.5 CALLS A
19:28:03  DAY HOMELESS DISCIPLINE CALLS FROM DISTRICT 3 AND THIS IS WHERE YOU WANT
19:28:06  TO INTRODUCE ANOTHER  HOMELESS PROGRAM?
THINK
19:28:10  ABOUT IT.
IT'S VERY APPARENT THAT YOU DON'T
19:28:13  CARE FOR US, THE COMMON PEOPLE.
HOW ARE THE
19:28:16  PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO BE LIVING THE NIGHT IN AN OPEN PARKING
19:28:19  LOT BE SAFE AGAINST THESE 3.5 CALLS?

19:28:23 PLEASE THINK ABOUT IT.
AND I WILL LET THE REMAINING
19:28:26  8 SECONDS GO IN SILENCE IN THEIR SUPPORT.

19:28:34 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
LISA
19:28:37  DANS.
>> HI, THANK YOU.
THIS IS LISA D
19:28:40 ANZ.
I LIVE IN DISTRICT 3 AND I'M SPEAKING IN
19:28:43  FAVOR OF THE SAFE PARKING PROGRAM.

19:28:47 I'VE GOTTEN TO VOLUNTEER WITH THE PROGRAM A FEW TIMES AND IT
19:28:50  RUNS REALLY SMOOTHLY, THE PARTICIPANTS ARE REALLY NICE, AND
19:28:55  I JUST WANT TO REMIND FOLKS WHEN SOMETIMES OPPONENTS
19:28:58  CLAIM THEY'RE SPEAKING ON THE BEHALF OF THE PARTICIPANTS BUT
19:29:02  THESE COMMENTS ARE NOT COMING FROM PATS PANTS.
THE PARTICIPANTS ARE
19:29:05  HAPPY TO HAVE THE PROGRAM AND I -- IT WOULD
19:29:08  DEFINITELY DO A DISSERVICE TO HALT THE PROGRAM WHILE MAKING CHANGES TO IT.

19:29:12 SO I JUST WANT TO REITERATE MY CONTINUED SUPPORT FOR THE PROGRAM AND
19:29:15  THAT IT'S GOING QUITE WELL AND THAT'S IT.
THANK YOU
19:29:19 .

19:29:22 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
NEXT SPEAKER IS MARIE.

19:29:27 >> THANK YOU.
MY NAME IS MARIE HUGHES AND I'M A LONG-
19:29:30 TIME RESIDENT OF FREMONT AND A MEMBER OF THE LEADERSHIP TEAM OF
19:29:34  FREMONT FOR EVERYONE.
TODAY I READ AN ARTICLE ABOUT THE
19:29:39  2022 TIME COUNTS SO I LOOKED UP FREMONT'S COUNT.

19:29:43 IN 2019, FREMONT HAD
19:29:46  608 UNHOUSED PEOPLE.
IN 2022, THAT
19:29:49  NUMBER HAS DOUBLED TO
19:29:53  1,026.
THIS IS NOT UNEXPECTED GIVEN THE ECONOMIC
19:29:56  REALITIES OF PANDEMIC WE ARE LIVING IN,
19:29:59  BUT ONE INTERESTING RESULT THAT WE FOUND IS THAT
19:30:02  WHILE OVERALL NUMBERS HAVE DOUBLED, THE NUMBER OF FREMONT
19:30:05  RESIDENTS LIVING IN CARS AND RVs
19:30:08  HAS MORE THAN DOUBLED.
IN 2019, WE HAD
19:30:12  95 RESIDENTS LIVING IN CARS.
TODAY THAT NUMBER IS A
19:30:15  WHOPPING 311.
THAT IS MORE THAN
19:30:18  A THREE TIMES INCREASE.

19:30:22 WE ALSO SAW LIKE A TWO TIMES INCREASE
19:30:25  IN PEOPLE LIVING IN  RVs.
THIS IS WHY
19:30:29  FREMONT SAFE PARKING PILOT PROGRAM IS SO VITAL.
IT'S ALSO
19:30:32  WHY IT NEEDS TO BE EXPANDED BEYOND THE CURRENT FOUR SITES
19:30:36 , AND WE NEED THE CITY SPONSORED PROGRAM THAT WOULD SERVE MORE
19:30:39  PEOPLE AND WOULD INCLUDE FAMILIES
19:30:42  IN RVs.
HISTORY HAS SHOWN THAT PROGRAMS LIKE THIS MAKE
19:30:45  NEIGHBORHOODS SAFER BY GETTING CARS AND RVs OFF THE STREET AND INTO A
19:30:48  SAFE ENVIRONMENT.
THIS KEEPS THE UNHOUSED
19:30:52  SAFE FROM CRIME AGAINST PERSONS AND IT LIMITS THE NEED FOR THEM TO
19:30:55  COMMIT PETTY CRIMES SUCH AS
19:30:59  RELIEVING THEMSELVES IN THE  BUSHES AND THINGS LIKE THAT.

19:31:04 THEREFORE, I URGE YOU TO KEEP THE
19:31:07  CURRENT SAFE PARKING PROGRAM AND ALSO TO EXPAND IT.
THANK YOU
19:31:10 .
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
NEXT
19:31:13  SPEAKER IS JOHN HINDS.

19:31:18 >> HELLO, EVERYONE.
I
19:31:21  HAD PREPARED A DIFFERENT SPEECH TONIGHT ABOUT
19:31:24  PUBLIC PARTICIPATION IN MEETINGS, AND I WAS GOING TO
19:31:28  LEAD OFF WITH A STORY ABOUT A MEETING
19:31:32  IN MARCH OF 2019 WHERE THE ITEM DIDN'T EVEN GET STARTED UNTIL
19:31:35  AFTER 11:00 BECAUSE SO MANY PEOPLE HAD WANTED
19:31:38  TO SPEAK ON THE PREVIOUS TOPIC, THE SILICON SAGE
19:31:41   DEVELOPMENT, AND THE CITY  ALLOWED THEM ALL THROUGH, WHICH I THINK IS GREAT.

19:31:44 AND THE THEME THERE WAS GOING TO BE THESE PARTICIPATORY
19:31:47  DEMOCRATIC PROCESSES COULD BE SLOW, THEY COULD BE TIRING, AND THEY
19:31:51  COULD BE MESSY, BUT THEY'RE VALUABLE.

19:31:54 NOW I'VE TOSSED THAT SPEECH FOR SOMETHING ELSE BECAUSE WE GOT TWO MINUTES TONIGHT
19:31:57 .
I WAS EXPLAINING TO SOMEBODY RECENTLY
19:32:01  HOW THINGS HAVE WORKED IN THE PREZOOM AND
19:32:04  POST ZOOM  ERA.
IN THE OLD DAYS IN THE
19:32:07  COUNCIL CHAMBERS, WE HAD THOSE YELLOW CARDS AND
19:32:10  THE MAYOR COULD SEE HOW MANY PEOPLE WANTED TO SPEAK, DO A
19:32:13  LITTLE DIVISION IN HER HEAD AND DECIDE HOW MANY MINUTES TO GIVE EVERY
19:32:17 ONE.
IT'S DIFFERENT IN THE ZOOM ERA BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW WHO'S
19:32:20  GOING TO RAISE THEIR HAND LATER.
I GET THAT.
THE DEFAULT
19:32:24  PRESUME WAS FOUR MINUTES TO BE REDUCED AS NEEDED.
I'VE NEVER SEEN
19:32:28  ANYTHING MORE THAN THREE MINUTES SINCE ZOOM BEGAN
19:32:31 .
AND MOST OFTEN NOW IT SEEMS TO BE DEFAULTING
19:32:35  TO 2 MINUTES.
LAST WEEK THE ENTIRE MEETING ENDED
19:32:38  BY 8:30, AND YET PUBLIC
19:32:42  COMMENT SPEAKERS GOT TWO  MINUTES.

19:32:45 TONIGHT MIGHT TURN OUT TO BE A LONG ONE SO MAYBE THIS IS THE WRONG NIGHT
19:32:48  FOR ME TO BRING THIS UP, BUT PLEASE CONSIDER ALLOWING MORE
19:32:51  TIME WHEN IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE WE'RE GOING TO BE UP LATE THIS NIGHT.

19:32:55 OTHERWISE
19:32:58  HAD CREATES THE APPEARANCE OF IMPATIENCE WITH PUBLIC
19:33:01  PARTICIPATION IN A MEETING THAT US A TENSE
19:33:05  THAT
19:33:08  OSTENSIBLY WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE FULLY INVOLVED  IN.
THANK YOU.

19:33:11 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
NEXT SPEAKER IS
19:33:15  KATHERINE.

19:33:20 >> HELLO.
THANK YOU SO MUCH AGAIN FOR ALL OF YOUR
19:33:23  SUPPORT FOR THE HOMELESS FOLK
19:33:27  IN FREMONT.
I
19:33:30  DO APPRECIATE EVERYTHING THAT YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN DOING IN TERMS
19:33:33  OF THE HNC
19:33:36 , SAFE PARKING,
19:33:40  PROJECT HOMEKEY, AND I'M STILL HOPING THAT THAT DOES GO THROUGH
19:33:43  THROUGH.

19:33:46 I'M SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE SAFE PARKING
19:33:50  PROGRAM TONIGHT.
AND I'VE NOTICED A COUPLE OF
19:33:53  TIMES THAT THERE HAS BEEN A REQUEST FOR
19:33:57  EXTENSIVE SECURITY MEASURES WHICH WOULD
19:34:00  BE VERY, VERY COSTLY
19:34:07 , AND I JUST WANT TO REMIND PEOPLE OUT THERE THAT THIS IS A VOLUNTEER
19:34:10  BASIS PRETTY MUCH.

19:34:14 CHURCHES ARE VOLUNTEERING THEIR SPACE,
19:34:17  THE PEOPLE WHO ARE WORKING THE SITE ARE  VOLUNTEERING THEIR
19:34:20  TIME, AND
19:34:24  I DON'T FIND IT NECESSARY TO
19:34:27  SPEND A LOT OF MONEY ON
19:34:30  SOMETHING WHEN THERE ARE NOT ANY EXISTING PROBLEMS.

19:34:34 AND IF THERE ARE PROBLEMS, THEY WOULD BE EXTREMELY MINIMAL
19:34:37 .
SO I DON'T SEE ANY REASON FOR THAT
19:34:40 .

19:34:44 I WOULD LIKE TO SEE SAFE PARKING
19:34:48  EXPANDED BY UTILIZING SOME
19:34:52  UNUSED CITY PROPERTIES, AND POSSIBLY
19:34:56  EVEN SOME SPACE
19:34:59  FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE LIVING IN TENTS AND DON'T
19:35:03  HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OF A CAR OR AN RV
19:35:06 .
SO
19:35:09  THAT, TO ME, I FEEL WOULD BE REALLY IMPORTANT AS WELL.

19:35:15 AND I YIELD THE REST OF MY TIME.

19:35:28 [MAYOR MUTED]

19:35:34 >> Councilmember Jones: YOU'RE ON MUTE, MADAME MAYOR.

19:35:36 >> Ms. Gauthier: SIVAQ IS THE NEXT SPEAKER.
>> HI.

19:35:38 CAN YOU HEAR ME?
>> Ms. Gauthier: YES.
>> HI.

19:35:42 MY NAME IS SIVAQ.
I'M TALKING
19:35:45  ON THE SAFE PARKING PROGRAM TO BE
19:35:49  HELD AT CHRIST THE KING LUTHERAN CHURCH.

19:35:52 SO I WOULD LIKE TO ACTUALLY COMMENT ON THE SAFE PARKING
19:35:55  PROGRAM IMPLEMENTED IN THE CITY OF FREMONT.
ALTHOUGH THE
19:35:59  PROGRAM OBJECTIVE IS CORRECT, TO
19:36:02  SUPPORT THE  HOMELESS PEOPLE, BUT THE LOCATION CHOSEN ARE
19:36:05  REALLY, REALLY BAD AND THEY ARE NOT
19:36:09  ACTUALLY -- THERE ARE
19:36:12  SOME LOCATION SPECIFICATIONS GOING ON AND I'M
19:36:15  JUST QUOTING A RECENT STUDY FROM UNIVERSITY OF
19:36:18  SOUTHERN
19:36:22  SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AROUND ANALYZED
19:36:25  12 SAFE PARKING  PROGRAMS
19:36:28 , SAN DIEGO -- REGISTER
19:36:31  REGISTERED SEX OFFENDERS FROM PARTICIPATING.

19:36:34 I DON'T THINK THESE ARE ACTUALLY THERE IN TERMS OF
19:36:38  THE PROGRAM IMPLEMENTED IN FREMONT, AT LEAST
19:36:41  NOT IN THE PAPER, IT'S NOT EXPLICITLY SAID.

19:36:44 MOUNTAIN VIEW AND PALO ALTO HAS
19:36:48  TAKEN MEASUR
19:36:51  MEASURES TO INSTALL SECURITY CAMERAS, SITES AWAY FROM THE RESIDENTS
19:36:54  INCLUDING CITY LOTS OR EMPTY VT
19:36:57 A PARKING STATIONS, SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
OF SO IT'S ALSO
19:37:01  FROM 2019 SURVEY THAT IS BEING QUOTED
19:37:04  FOR THIS PROGRAM.
FROM THE 2019 SURVEY
19:37:08 , EVEN THE HOMELESS PEOPLE WHO
19:37:11  HAS BEEN SURVEYED HAS RECOMMENDED TO HOST THIS PROGRAM IN THE
19:37:14  CITY LIMITS, CITY
19:37:17 -OWNED BUILDINGS RATHER THAN ON A CHURCH OR A
19:37:21  FAITH-BASED ORGANIZATIONS.
I BELIEVE
19:37:25  MAYOR LILY MEI SHOULD TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION OF THIS AND
19:37:29  TAKE A SECOND LOOK AT THE SURVEY TO GO BACK AND CORRECT THESE PROGRAM
19:37:32 S AND IMPLEMENT IT IN THE PROPER WAY.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
19:37:36 .
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
THE
19:37:39  NEXT SPEAKER
19:37:42  IS --  APOLOGIES.
NEXT SPEAKER
19:37:45  IS MI
19:37:49 YO, S. MI
19:37:52 YO.
YOU'RE ON MUTE, PLEASE.

19:37:57 S MIYO.
>> HI, COULD YOU HEAR ME OKAY
19:37:59 ?
>> Mayor Mei: YES.
>> HI, MAYOR AND CITY COUNCILMEMBERS.

19:38:03 MY NAME IS SHIRLEY AND I LIVE IN THE
19:38:06  SHINN NEIGHBORHOOD.
I'VE BEEN A LONG-TIME RESIDENT OF FREMONT.

19:38:09 I'M REALLY VOICING MY CONCERN BECAUSE OF THE SAFE PARKING
19:38:13  PROGRAM THAT'S ABOUT TO BE IMPLEMENTED IN JUNE AT THE CHRIST
19:38:16  THE KING CHURCH.
AND THAT SHOULD REALLY
19:38:19  HAVE -- WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR IS ENHANCED SAFETY
19:38:22  MEASURES.
WE'RE NOT AGAINST IT WHICH IS ASKING FOR SAFETY MEASURES.
19:38:25 
THE CURRENT SETUP LACKS
19:38:29  CONSIDERATION TO ITS PARTICIPANTS, THE SCHOOLS, SENIOR HOMES, NEAR
19:38:33 BY -- AND US, THE NEARBY COMMUNITIES
19:38:36 .
I AND MANY NEIGHBORS HAVE SUF
19:38:40   SUFFERED SERIOUS CRIME CAUSED BY HOMELESSNESS IN THE
19:38:43  LAST COUPLE YEARS TO INCLUDE ARSON,  CARJACKING, PHYSICAL ASSAULTS
19:38:46 , VERBAL ABUSES, TRESPASSING, YOU NAME IT.

19:38:50 WE'VE HAD IT.
AND ALL WE'RE ASKING
19:38:53  FOR IS REALLY STUFF LIKE
19:38:56  CAMERA INSTALLATION FOR SECURITY SURVEILLANCE
19:38:59 , GATE INSTALLATION TO ENSURE
19:39:03  ONLY THE PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS ARE GOING IN AND OUT,
19:39:06  ESPECIALLY DURING THOSE HOURS WHERE THERE'S NO  VOLUNTEERS ON SITE
19:39:10 , AND INCREASED PATROLS OF OUR NEIGHBORHOOD
19:39:13 .
JUST TO ENSURE THAT THERE'S NO INCREASED CRIME AND
19:39:16  PREVENT SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITIES.

19:39:21 THESE ARE ONLY BASIC SAFETY MEASURES THAT WE'RE ASKING FOR, AND WE REALLY DON'T WANT
19:39:24  THIS PROGRAM TO HAVE A BAD NAME OR HAVE IT
19:39:27  FAIL, AND WE WANT TO KEEP OUR DESIGNATION IN FREMONT
19:39:31  AS THE HAPPIEST CITY.
WE DON'T WANT TO LOSE THAT, BUT IT
19:39:34  SEEMS LIKE THERE'S A LOT OF UNHAPPY PEOPLE.
THIS IS WHAT WE'RE ASKING
19:39:37  FOR, AND WE'RE HOPING THAT YOU'LL LISTEN TO THE VOICE OF YOUR CONSTITUENTS
19:39:41 .
THANK YOU.

19:39:45 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
NEXT SPEAKER IS ANKIT
19:39:48 .

19:39:52 >> HELLO, CAN EVERYBODY HEAR ME?

19:39:55 >> Mayor Mei: YES.
>> HELLO.
I
19:39:59  AM ANKIT, I'M HERE TO SAY THAT THE
19:40:02  SAFE PARKING PROGRAM AT THE CHRIST THE KING
19:40:05  LUTHERAN CHURCH IS NOT AT ALL SAFE BECAUSE IT LACKS
19:40:08  COMMON SENSE SAFETY MEASURE
19:40:11 S.
THERE ARE A COUPLE OF POINTS THAT I WOULD LIKE TO
19:40:15  EMPHASIZE.
SPECIFICALLY FOR CHILDREN'S
19:40:18  SAFETY.
IT IS .8 MILES
19:40:21  AWAY FROM PARKMONT
19:40:25  ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, AND IT IS RIGHT NEXT DOOR
19:40:28  TO  LEARNING KIDS
19:40:31  MONTESSORI AND MONTESSORI
19:40:34  RIGHT NEXT DOOR, PUTTING KIDS AT RISK THERE.

19:40:37 SAFE PARKING PROGRAM DOESN'T HAVE ANY
19:40:41  SURVEILLANCE CAMERA SO WE DON'T KNOW WHO ENTERS THE SITE A
19:40:45  AT 2:00 A.M. OR LEAVES.

19:40:48 ALSO PARTICIPANTS CAN  SELF-CHECK-IN WHICH IS KIND OF
19:40:51  A JOKE.
THAT MEANS ANYONE CAN BASICALLY GO
19:40:54  INTO THE CHURCH AT ANY TIME.

19:40:57 AND THAT'S THE REASON I DO NOT SUPPORT THE LOCATION.
THANK YOU.

19:41:04 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
AND THAT'S THE LAST OF OUR
19:41:07  PUBLIC COMMENT.
I'M GOING TO CLOSE THE PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD AND WE'LL TURN IT
19:41:10  BACK TO OUR NEXT AGENDA ITEMS, WHICH
19:41:13  IS OUR REGULARLY SCHEDULED AGENDA ITEM ON THE BUBLGHT
19:41:17  BUDGET THIS EVENING.
AND THE NEXT ITEM IS THE FISCAL YEAR
19:41:21  2022-23 PROPOSED OPERATING BUDGET.
AND WE HAVE A
19:41:24  PRESENTATION THIS EVENING FROM OUR FINANCE DIRECTOR, DAVE
19:41:28  PERSSELIN.
THANK YOU.

19:41:31 WELCOME, DIRECTOR PERSSELIN.
>> Mr. Persselin: THANK YOU,
19:41:34  MADAME MAYOR.
TONIGHT WE'RE PRESENTING THE PROPOSED OPERATING BUDGET FOR
19:41:37  FISCAL YEAR 2022-23.
THE
19:41:40  CITY'S BUDGET IS OUR FINANCIAL PLAN FOR DELIVERING SERVICES TO
19:41:44  THE COMMUNITY OVER THE NEXT YEAR.
I'M GOING TO
19:41:48  ASK FOR THE
19:41:51  FIRST SLIDE.

19:41:58 AND WE'LL MOVE ON TO THE NEXT SLIDE.

19:42:03 CITY SERVICES SUPPORTED BY GENERAL REVENUE SUCH AS PROPERTY AND
19:42:06  SALES TAXES ARE BUDGET
19:42:10  BUDGETED IN THE GENERAL FUND.
THE EXPENDITURES
19:42:13  FOR THESE SERVICES TOTAL
19:42:17  $249.3 MILLION FOR NEXT YEAR.
SERVICES SUPPORTED
19:42:20  BY USER FEES, SUCH AS PLAN CHECKING,
19:42:25  BUILDING INSPECTION AND RECREATION CLASSES, ARE BUDGETED IN THE
19:42:28  DEVELOPMENT AND RECREATION COST CENTERS.
OTHER SERVICE
19:42:31 S PAID FROM RESTRICTED SOURCES SUCH AS GRANTS AND FEE
19:42:34 S ARE BUDGETED IN SPECIAL REVENUE FUNDS.

19:42:37 TWO OF THE LARGEST SPECIAL REVENUE FUNDS ARE HUMAN SERVICES
19:42:41  AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT BLOCK GRANT.

19:42:44 FINALLY, CAPITAL PROJECTS, MANY OF WHICH ARE PAID FROM RESTRICTED
19:42:48  SOURCES SUCH AS STATE GAS TAX AND
19:42:51  COUNTY MEASURE B AND MEASURE BB SALES TAX
19:42:54  REVENUE ARE BUDGETED IN CAPITAL FUNDS.

19:43:00 EXPENDITURES BUDGETED OUTSIDE THE FUND
19:43:03  TOTAL $151 MILLION.
THIS PRESENTATION INCLUDES AN
19:43:07  UPDATE ON THE CITY'S ECONOMIC AND FISCAL
19:43:10  CONDITION, AN OVERVIEW OF THE PROPOSED BUDGET, AND SOME
19:43:13  PROJECTIONS FOR THE FUTURE.
NEXT SLIDE, PLEASE
19:43:17 .
THE NATIONAL
19:43:20  ECONOMY HAS BEEN STEADILY RECOVERING FROM THE PANDEMIC-RELATED
19:43:23  RECESSION.
GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT OR
19:43:27  GDP GREW BY AN IMPRESSIVE 6.9%
19:43:31  IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2021.
AND THE UNEMPLOYMENT

19:43:59  CHAINS.

19:44:03 THOSE DISRUPTIONS WERE EVIDENT IN FIRST QUARTER
19:44:06  GDP ADVANCE ESTIMATE, WHICH SHOWED A REDUCTION OF
19:44:09  1.4% IN THE  ECONOMY.
OUR
19:44:13  PROPOSED BUDGET FOR 2022-23 IS BAS
19:44:16 ED ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT AWR LOCAL ECONOMY
19:44:19  OUR LOCAL ECONOMY AND GENERAL FUND REVENUE
19:44:22 S WILL CONTINUE TO RECOVER.
IF INSTEAD OUR REVENUE
19:44:25  GROWTH STALLS OR INFLATION DRIVES COST
19:44:28 S ABOVE THEIR BUDGETED
19:44:31  LEVEL, WE CAN PLAIN TAIN SERVICES IN THE NEAR TERM BY DRAWING ON THE
19:44:35  GENERAL FUND BUDGET UNCERTAINTY RESERVE.

19:44:38 ADDITIONALLY, WHILE
19:44:41  I'LL REMIND YOU THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS PROVIDED THE CITY THE
19:44:44  OPPORTUNITY TO RESTORE OR MAINTAIN SERVICES THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE
19:44:48  REDUCED DUE TO PANDEMIC-RELATED REVENUE LOSSES
19:44:51  THROUGH THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN ACT,
19:44:54  LOCAL FISCAL RECOVERY  FUNDS.
THE CITY RECEIVE
19:44:58 ED $22.1 MILLION OF FISCAL RECOVERY
19:45:01  FUNDS IN MAY 2021 THAT WERE USED TO
19:45:04  RESTORE SERVICES IN THE CURRENT YEAR BUDGET.

19:45:07 AND WE EXPECT TO RECEIVE A
19:45:11  SECOND ALLOCATION OF THE SAME AMOUNT IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS
19:45:14 .
NEXT SLIDE, PLEASE.

19:45:21 PROPERTY TAX, ABOUT HALF OF OUR GENERAL FUND REVENUES, IS BASED ON
19:45:24  VALUES ESTABLISHED ON THE JANUARY 1ST MEETING
19:45:28  DATE.
THAT MEANS REVENUES FOR NEXT FISCAL YEAR WERE
19:45:31  DETERMINED BY THE UNUSUALLY STRONG REAL ESTATE MARKET DURING
19:45:34  CALENDAR YEAR 2021.

19:45:40 UNDER PROPOSITION
19:45:43  13, ADJUST WITH THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRICE INDEX WITH A
19:45:46  2% LIMIT.
UNLESS THERE'S A CHANGE IN OWNERSHIP
19:45:51  OR NEW CONSTRUCTION.
THE
19:45:54  CCPI ADJUSTMENT FOR NEXT YEAR'S TAX ROLL IS AN
19:45:57  INCREASE OF 2%.
WE'RE ESTIMATING
19:46:01  AN ADDITIONAL INCREASE IN VALUE FROM CHANGES IN OWNERSHIP
19:46:06  OF 5% BASED ON PROPERTY TRANSFER
19:46:09  TAX DATA AND PRELIMINARY INFORMATION FROM THE COUNTY ASSESSOR
19:46:13 .
A FURTHER ESTIMATED INCREASE
19:46:16  OF 1% FOR THE VALUE OF NEW CONSTRUCTION REFLECTS THE CONTINUE
19:46:19 ING DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY IN WARM SPRINGS AND
19:46:22  OTHER AREAS. OF THE CITY.
THE LAST TWO YEARS OF
19:46:25  THE FORECAST ASSUME GROWTH
19:46:29  AT A HISTORICAL AVERAGE OF ABOUT 6%.
DURING
19:46:32  THE MID YEAR BUDGET REPORT IN MARCH, I NOTED THAT THE BIG
19:46:36  STORY FOR CURRENT YEAR REVENUE IS SALES TAX
19:46:39 .
THROUGH THE FIRST TWO QUARTERS
19:46:42  OF THE YEAR, WE'VE RECEIVED ABOUT $15 MILLION MORE THAN WE
19:46:45  ANTICIPATED.
MOST OF THAT CAN BE
19:46:48  ATTRIBUTED TO WHAT IS LIKELY A TEMPORARY SURGE
19:46:51  IN NEW AUTO SALES.
SIMILAR TO THE
19:46:54  TEMPORARY SURGE WE EXPERIENCED IN FISCAL YEAR
19:46:58  2018-19.
BECAUSE OUR SHARE OF
19:47:02  COUNTY  POOLED SALES AND USE TAX  REVENUES IS BASED ON
19:47:05  OUR SHARE OF COUNTY-WIDE LOCAL SALES TAX REVENUE
19:47:09 S, WE'RE SEE
19:47:12 ING UNUSUALLY HIGH LEVELS OF REVENUE IN THAT POOL CATEGORY AS
19:47:15  WELL.
IN TOTAL, WE'RE PROJECTING TO RECEIVE OVER
19:47:21  $21 MILLION MORE IN SALES TAX REVENUE THIS YEAR THAN WE BUDGETED
19:47:24 .
BECAUSE WE'RE ESTIMATING THE
19:47:28  $10.8 MILLION OF THIS YEAR'S SALES TAX REVENUES
19:47:31  ONE TIME, THEY ARE EXPECTED TO DECLINE NEXT YEAR.

19:47:35 WITHOUT THAT ONE-TIME  DISTORTION, SALES TAX
19:47:38  REVENUES WOULD BE ESTIMATED TO GROW APPROXIMATELY
19:47:43  2.2% NEXT YEAR.
WE'RE PROJECTING ANNUAL GROWTH OF
19:47:46  ABOUT 2% IN SUBSEQUENT YEARS.

19:47:51 WE'RE SEEING A MORE RAPID THAN ANTICIPATED RECOVERY
19:47:54  IN BUSINESS TAX REVENUE THIS YEAR.
TO AID LOCAL BUSINESSES
19:47:58  IMPACTED BY THE PANDEMIC, THE CITY WAIVED PENALTIES
19:48:01  AND INTEREST ON DELINQUENT BUSINESS TAXES DURING CALENDAR
19:48:04  YEARS 2020 AND 2021.

19:48:08 AS A RESULT, A PORTION OF THE CURRENT YEAR REVENUE
19:48:11  CONSISTS OF DELINQUENT PRIOR-YEAR BUSINESS
19:48:14  TAXES THAT ARE NOW BEING PAID TO
19:48:18  AVOID ACCRUING PENALTIES AND INTEREST.

19:48:22 BECAUSE THIS YEAR'S REVENUE MAY BE INFLATED BY THOSE PRIOR-
19:48:25 YEAR PAYMENTS, WE'RE PROJECTING NEXT YEAR'S IMROAT TO
19:48:28  YEAR'S GROWTH TO BE SOMEWHAT LOWER THAN THE HISTORICAL AVERAGE OF
19:48:32  ABOUT 3%.

19:48:35 FRANCHISE FEES ARE EXPECTED TO GROW MODESTLY OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS
19:48:39 .
WITH STRONGER PERFORMANCE FROM THE CITY'S SOLID
19:48:42  WASTE AND UTILITY FEES OFFSET BY THE
19:48:45  CONTINUING DECLINE IN THE CABLE TELEVISION FRANCHISE
19:48:49 .
THE SOURCE OF GENERAL FUND REVENUE
19:48:53  MOST HEAVILY IMPACTED BY THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC
19:48:56  IS HOTEL TAX.
WITH
19:48:59  OCCUPANCY RATES INCREASING IN THE 60% RANGE, THE ESTIMATE
19:49:02  FOR CURRENT-YEAR HOTEL TAX REF NEWELL HAS INCREASED
19:49:05  TO $4.3 MILLION.
SLIGHT
19:49:09 LY MORE THAN DOUBLE THE PRIOR YEAR ACTUAL
19:49:12  AMOUNT OF
19:49:15  $2.8 MILLION.
NEXT YEAR'S HOTEL TAX REVENUES
19:49:18  WERE ESTIMATE TODAY REACH $5.5 MILLION, AN ANNUAL
19:49:22  INCREASE OF 26%.
BUT STILL LESS THAN
19:49:26  TWO THIRDS OF THE PRE-PANDEMIC LEVEL.

19:49:33 CHARGES FOR SERVICES ARE EXPECTED TO REMAIN STABLE OVER THE FORECAST HORIZON
19:49:37 .
FISCAL RECOVERY FUNDS OF
19:49:40  $20 MILLION RECEIVED IN 2020-21 ARE
19:49:43  INCLUDED IN THE OTHER REVENUE CATEGORY.

19:49:46 THE OTHER $2.1 MILLION WE RECEIV
19:49:49 ED LAST YEAR WAS USED TO STABILIZE THE CITY'S
19:49:53  RECREATION FUND.

19:49:56 $22.1MILLION OF FISCAL RECOVERY FUNDS ANTICIPATED TO
19:49:59  BE RECEIVED THIS YEAR ARE SHOWN IN THE 2021-
19:50:03  2021-22 COLUMN.

19:50:07 EXCLUDING THE FISCAL RECOVERY FUNDS RECEIVED LAST YEAR AND THIS YEAR
19:50:10 , AS WELL AS THE ESTIMATED $10.8 MILLION OF
19:50:13   ONE-TIME SALES TAX, OUR ONGOING REVENUE
19:50:16 S ARE PROJECTED TO INCREASE BY ABOUT
19:50:20  7.6% IN THE CURRENT YEAR, AND
19:50:24  4.1% NEXT YEAR.

19:50:27 NEXT SLIDE, PLEASE.

19:50:32 REVENUES AND TRANSFERS IN ARE CONSISTENT WITH WHAT WAS SHOWN
19:50:35  ON THE PREVIOUS SLIDE.
I'LL POINT
19:50:38  OUT THAT THE $22.1 MILLION OF FISCAL RECOVERY
19:50:42  FUNDS THAT WE ANTICIPATE RECEIVING THIS
19:50:45  YEAR CONSTITUTE THE MAJORITY OF THE UNRESERVED FUND BALANCE
19:50:48  THAT YOU SEE AS A SOURCE OF FUNDS FOR THE
19:50:52  2022-23 PROPOSED BUDGET.

19:50:56 GENERAL FUND BUDGET DEVELOPMENT BEGINS IN JANUARY, WITH
19:50:59  PREPARATION OF A BASE BUDGET THAT ASSUMES THE CURRENT YEAR
19:51:03  STAFFING CONFIGURATION, REMOVES ANY ONE-TIME
19:51:06  EXPENDITURES, AND THEN ADDS IN ADJUSTMENTS
19:51:09  FOR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND DEBT SERVICE REQUIREMENTS
19:51:13 .
THE BASE BUDGET ALSO INCORPORATES
19:51:16  PENSION AND RETIREE HEALTHCARE CONTRIBUTIONS
19:51:19  PROJECTED BY OUR CALPERS AND CONSULTING ACTUARY
19:51:22 IES.
AND INCLUDES ADDITIONAL UNFUNDED
19:51:25  PENSION LIABILITY CONTRIBUTIONS FOR COUNCIL POLICY
19:51:29 .
FINALLY, WE ASSUME
19:51:32  VACANCY  SAVINGS IN EACH YEAR BASED ON CURRENT AND PROJECTED
19:51:35  VACANCIES.
WE ARE CURRENTLY ENGAGED IN A
19:51:39  COLLECTIVE BARGAINING PROCESS, THAT THE BASE
19:51:42  BUDGET ASSUMES NO COMPENSATION OR BENEFIT INCREASES.
SO THE
19:51:46  NEXT STEP IN BUDGET DEVELOPMENT WAS TO
19:51:49  INCORPORATE PLACEHOLDER COMPENSATION INCREASES IN EACH
19:51:53  YEAR OF THE FORECAST.
THOSE PLACEHOLDER
19:51:56  INCREASES ARE 3% FOR THIS BUDGET CYCLE
19:52:00 .
THE ONGOING DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OUR REVENUE
19:52:03  PROJECTIONS AND THE MODIFIED BASE BUDGET DEFINES OUR
19:52:07  FISCAL CAPACITY FOR ENHANCING OR EXPANDING SERVICES
19:52:11 .
AS OUR REVENUES ARE STILL RECOVERING
19:52:14  FROM THE  PANDEMIC-INDUCED RECESSION, THE PROPOSED
19:52:17  BUDGET MAKES USE OF FISCAL RECOVERY FUNDS
19:52:20  TO BALANCE THE BUDGET IN EACH YEAR OF THE FORECAST
19:52:23 .
CONSISTENT WITH THE CITY  COUNCIL'S FOUNDATIONAL
19:52:27  PRINCIPLE OF FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY, THE
19:52:30  PROPOSED ADDITIONAL STAFFING AND SERVICE ENHANCEMENTS ARE
19:52:33  LIMITED TO LEVELS THAT WE CAN SUPPORT ON
19:52:37  AN ONGOING BASIS.
THE PROPOSED BUDGET INCLUDE
19:52:40 S FUNDING FOR A FIRE TRUCK  COMPANY, TWO ADDITIONAL
19:52:43  POLICE OFFICERS, INCREASED FUNDING FOR PARK AND
19:52:47  BUILDING MAINTENANCE, AND A NUMBER
19:52:49  OF OTHER  INITIATIVES THAT ADDRESS CITY COUNCIL AND COMMUNITY  PRIORITIES.

19:52:54 THE $16 MILLION OF UNRESERVED FUND WALL
19:52:58  BALANCE YOU SEE AT THE END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD EQUATES
19:53:02  TO ABOUT 2% OF THE PROPOSED AND PROJECTED
19:53:06  EXPENDITURES OVER THE THREE-YEAR HORIZON.
AND
19:53:09  HELPS PROTECT US FROM THE UNUSUALLY HIGH LEVEL OF
19:53:13  UNSIRNT IN BOTH OUR CURRENT REVENUE AND
19:53:17  EXPENDITURE PROJECTIONS.
AS PART OF THE
19:53:20  2021-22 YEAR-END REPORT IN THE FALL
19:53:24 , STAFF COULD RECOMMEND ALLOCATING A PORTION OF
19:53:27  UNRESERVED FUND BALANCE FOR ONE-TIME PRIORITY
19:53:30  PROJECTS OR PROGRAMS
19:53:34  OR RESERVE AUGMENTATION IF NEEDED.
NEXT SLIDE, PLEASE.

19:53:40 THE PROPOSED BUDGET MAINTAINS THE GENERAL FUND CONTINGENCY RESERVE
19:53:43  AT 16.7% OF BUDGETED EXPENDITURE
19:53:47 S AND TRANSFERS OUT, OR
19:53:53  $41.6 MILLION.
A LEVEL CONSISTENT WITH CITY COUNCIL POLICY
19:53:56  AND A RECOMMENDED PRACTICE OF THE GOVERNMENT
19:54:00  FINANCE OFFICERS ASSOCIATION.
THE GENERAL FUND BUDGET UNCERTAINTY RESERVE
19:54:03  IS PROJECTED TO END THIS YEAR AT ITS CURRENT
19:54:06  LEVEL OF $10 MILLION AND WILL BE AVAILABLE TO
19:54:10  ADDRESS UNANTICIPATED REVENUE SHORTFALLS OR
19:54:14  EXPENDITURE INCREASES NEXT YEAR.
NEXT SLIDE, PLEASE.

19:54:20 THE MAJORITY OF OUR GENERAL FUND PROPOSED EXPENDITURE
19:54:23 S TARGET THE COMMUNITY'S THREE MAIN PRIORITIES
19:54:27 .
INCLUDING OVERHEAD COSTS
19:54:31 ,  POLICE, FIRE AND MAINTENANCE MAKE UP ABOUT
19:54:35  93% OF GENERAL FUND EXPENDITURES
19:54:38 .
THE OTHER CATEGORY SHOWN ON THE SLIDE INCLUDE
19:54:41 S SUPPORT FOR HUMAN SERVICES ACTIVITIES,
19:54:44  DEBT SERVICE PAYMENTS ON THE CITY'S BONDS, AND GENERAL
19:54:48  FUND CONTRIBUTIONS TO COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT, AFFORDABLE
19:54:51  HOUSING AND HOMELESS SERVICES, SOCIAL SERVICE GRANTS
19:54:55 , AND CAPITAL PROJECTS.

19:54:59 NEXT SLIDE, PLEASE.
ALTHOUGH THE
19:55:02  FOCUS OF THE PRESENTATION SO FAR HAS BEEN ON THE GENERAL FUND,
19:55:05  I'D LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE MAJOR
19:55:08   NON-GENERAL FUND OPERATIONS.
INCLUDING THE DEVELOP
19:55:11 MENT AND RECREATION COST CENTERS AND
19:55:15  THE HUMAN SERVICES SPECIAL REVENUE FUND.

19:55:21  LARGELY SUPPORTED BY USER FEES, AND THE HUMAN
19:55:24  SERVICES FUND IS SUPPORTED BY A COMBINATION OF
19:55:27  GRANTS AND FEES FOR SERVICE.
IN THE
19:55:30  DEVELOPMENT COST CENTER, COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT STAFF WILL BE WORKING
19:55:34  ON A NUMBER OF PROJECTS IN

19:56:55  FOR RECREATION CLASSES AND ACTIVITIES WITH
19:56:59  THE GOAL OF RETURNING TO  PRE-PANDEMIC

19:57:56 .
NEXT SLIDE, PLEASE.

19:58:01 THE FIRST COLUMN ON THE STAFFING TABLE SHOWS OUR CURRENT STAFFING LEVELS AND
19:58:04  REFLECTS CHANGES MADE SINCE THE 2021-
19:58:08 22 BUDGET WAS ADOPTED.
THOSE CHANGES
19:58:11  INCLUDE TWO  FEE-SUPPORTED COMMUNITY  DEVELOPMENT TECHNICIANS IN THE DEVELOP
19:58:14 MENT COST CENTER, AND THREE CONTRACT
19:58:17  SUPPORTED HUMAN SERVICES POSITIONS.

19:58:22 THE SECOND AND THIRD COLUMN SHOW NEXT YEAR'S PROPOSED STAFFING
19:58:25  LEVELS AND THE STAFFING CHANGES BY DEPARTMENT.
AS YOU CAN SEE,
19:58:28  THE PROPOSED BUDGET WOULD ADD
19:58:32  26 NEW POSITIONS CITY-WIDE.

19:58:36 15 OF THE PROPOSED POSITIONS IN THE GENERAL FUND
19:58:39  PROVIDE OR SUPPORT POLICE AND FIRE SERVICE
19:58:43  SERVICES, ANIMAL
19:58:46  SERVICING AND PARK MAINTENANCE, WITH THE OTHER THREE BRINGING MUCH NEEDED
19:58:49  CITYWIDE RECRUITING AND ACCOUNTING SUPPORT.

19:58:53 FIVE PLANNING AND ENGINEERING POSITIONS IN THE DEVELOPMENT COST CENTER
19:58:56  ARE FEE-SUPPORTED AND RESPOND TO AN INCREASE IN
19:59:00  DEMAND FOR PROCESSING  DEVELOPMENT PERMITS AND
19:59:03  AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS.
THE TWO PROPOSED POSITIONS IN THE
19:59:07  HUMAN SERVICES SPECIAL REVENUE FUNDS
19:59:10  CONSIST OF A CASE MANAGER TO IMPROVE HOMELESS CARE
19:59:14  AND RESPONSE AND A POSITION TO SUPPORT

FINALLY A
19:59:21  RECREATION SUPERVISOR IS PROPOSED IN THE RECREATION FUND TO OVERSEE OPERATIONS
19:59:24  AT THE NEWLY OPENED DOWNTOWN EVENT CENTER.

19:59:29 EVEN WITH THE ADDITION OF 26 POSITIONS
19:59:33  AT 4.3 POSITIONS PER 1,000 RESIDENTS
19:59:37 , FREMONT IS STILL AT THE LOW END OF PER
19:59:40  CAPITA STAFFING COMPARED WITH OUR NEIGHBORING CITIES
19:59:43 .
NEXT SLIDE
19:59:46 , PLEASE.

19:59:51 IN SUMMARY, NATIONAL ECONOMY HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL RECOVERING
19:59:54  FROM THE PANDEMIC-RELATED RECESSION, BUT HIGH
19:59:57  INFLATION, SANCTIONS RELATED TO THE RUSSIAN INNOVATION OF UKRAINE
20:00:00 , AND CONTINUING COVID LOCKDOWNS ARE CREATING
20:00:04  SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY AROUND
20:00:07  FUTURE GROWTH.
THIS PROPOSED BUDGET COMBINES OUR
20:00:11  RECOVERING ONGOING REVENUES WITH FEDERAL FISCAL RECOVERY
20:00:15  FUNDS TO NOT ONLY MAINTAINING CENTRAL
20:00:19  ESSENTIAL SERVICES BUT ALSO MEET
20:00:22  TARGETED IMPROVEMENTS THAT FOCUS ON CITY COUNCIL AND COMMUNITY PRIORITIES.

20:00:26 THESE SERVICE LEVEL ENHANCEMENTS ARE CONSISTENT WITH
20:00:29  THE CITY COUNCIL'S STATED FOUNDATIONAL PRINCIPLE
20:00:33  OF FISCAL  SUSTAINABILITY.

20:00:37 LOOKING OUT OVER THE FORECAST PERIOD, OUR ABILITY TO IMPROVE
20:00:40  ON THE CURRENT LEVEL OF SERVICES AND INVEST IN THE CITY'S
20:00:44  FUTURE WILL DEPEND ON CONTINUED REVENUE
20:00:47  GROWTH AND SUSTAINED FISCAL DISCIPLINE
20:00:50  BY THE CITY'S COLLECTIVE LEADERSHIP.

20:00:54 NEXT SLIDE, PLEASE.

20:00:59 THE FIRST PUBLIC HEARING ON THE PROPOSED OPERATING BUDGET IS SCHEDULED FOR THE CITY COUNCIL MEETING ON
20:01:02  JUNE 7TH.
AND THE SECOND PUBLIC HEARING AND
20:01:05  BUDGET ADOPTION ARE  SCHEDULED FOR JUNE 14TH.

20:01:09 THAT COMPLETES MY PRESENTATION.
AND I'LL HAND THE MEETING
20:01:12  BACK TO THE MAYOR FOR CITY COUNCIL QUESTIONS AND DISCUSSION.

20:01:19 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

20:01:23 I'M GOING TO FIRST SEE IF THERE'S ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE COUNCILMEMBERS.

20:01:31 CONCERNING THE BUDGET.
SEEING NO QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME FROM THE COUNCIL
20:01:34 , I WILL TAKE TO THE PUBLIC.

20:01:41 AND I SEE OUR FIRST SPEAKER.
WELCOME, KELLY
20:01:45 .
>> THANK YOU.
SO
20:01:52  THIS IS HALF THE BUDGET OR MORE IS GOING INTO POLICE AND FIRE, 93% IS
20:01:55  GOING TO POLICE, FIRE AND MAINTENANCE.
AND
20:01:58  THE COMPREHENSIVE ANNUAL -- AND THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF
20:02:02  DETAILS HERE ABOUT WHAT KIND OF ACTIVITIES AND PROGRAMS
20:02:07  ARE HAPPENING HERE AS
20:02:10  THE CITY MOVES ALONG WITH THIS
20:02:13  BUDGET.
SO IF YOU LOOK AT THE COMPREHENSIVE ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT OF THE CITY
20:02:17 , YOU SEE SOME REALLY
20:02:21  INTERESTING INFORMATION
20:02:24  ABOUT FOR EXAMPLE MOVING VIOLATIONS AND PARKING TICKETS.
IN
20:02:27  2020, THERE WAS ABOUT 7,000 OF THEM, AND LAST
20:02:30  I HEARD, THESE RED LIGHT
20:02:33  CAMERAS, THEY GIVE YOU A POINT ON YOUR DRIVING RECORD AND
20:02:37  THE RED LIGHT CAMERAS ARE DESIGNED TO
20:02:43  GET MOVING CARS SO IT WOULD SEEM THAT THE CARS, THAT THOSE
20:02:46  7,000 MOVING VIOLATIONS AND PARKING TICKETS IN 2020 WOULD
20:02:50  HAVE INCLUDED ABOUT ANOTHER -- ABOUT 7,000 OF THE RED LIGHT CAMERAS
20:02:54  BECAUSE CITY REPORTS ARE SAYING THAT YOU'RE ISSUING 7,000
20:02:57  TICKETS FOR RED LIGHT CAMERAS EVERY YEAR.

20:03:01 AND ALSO THAT NUMBER WENT UP BY
20:03:04  ANOTHER 15 OR 18,000 PER YEAR BASED
20:03:07  ON THE NEW PACIFIC COMMONS
20:03:14  CAMERAS.
SO IF YOU'RE HANDING OUT THOUSANDS
20:03:17  AND THOUSANDS OF TICKETS
20:03:22  AT RED LIGHT CAMERAS, HOW IS THAT YOU'RE ONLY REPORTING 13,000?

20:03:26 AND FINALLY,
20:03:29  ON THE OTHER END, THERE'S A
20:03:33  ARRESTS, ALSO
20:03:36  IN THE REPORT.

20:03:40 THE MOST RECENT YEAR THEY HAD A CERTAIN NUMBER,
20:03:44  1600.
FIVE YEARS EARLIER, THE NUMBER OF ARRESTS WAS DOUBLE
20:03:47  THAT, AND 15 YEARS EARLIER, THE NUMBER OF ARRESTS
20:03:50  WAS QUADRUPLE THAT.
THERE'S BEEN A STEADY DROP IN
20:03:54  ARRESTS AND THAT'S ONE OF THE IMPORTANT THINGS THE POLICE DEPARTMENT DOES.

20:03:57 MY QUESTION WOULD BE, HOW IS IT THAT WE CAN DROP THE NUMBER OF ARREST
20:04:00 S SO RADICALLY, BY A FACTOR OF
20:04:02  FOUR?
>> Mayor Mei: I'M SORRY, I THINK YOUR TIME IS UP.

20:04:10 THANK YOU.
THE NEXT SPEAKER ON THE BUDGET IS
20:04:17  -- I DON'T SEE ANY OTHER SPEAKERS AT THIS
20:04:20  TIME FOR THE BUDGET.
WE'LL TURN IT BACK -- I'M GOING
20:04:23  TO CLOSE PUBLIC COMMENT AND TURN IT BACK TO THE COUNCIL FOR DISCUSSION
20:04:26 .

20:04:33 COUNCILMEMBER JONES?

20:04:36 >> Councilmember Jones: THE ONLY COMMENT I WAS GOING TO MAKE IS, FIRST OF ALL, DIRECTOR 
20:04:39  PERSSELIN, FOR YOUR REPORT.
VERY DETAILED AS USUAL.

20:04:43 BUT THIS IS AN INFORMATIONAL ITEM AND IF WE NEED A MOTION
20:04:47  TO ACCEPT THE REPORT AND MOVE FORWARD, I'M ALL
20:04:50  FOR THAT.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
I
20:04:53  ALSO SEE COUNCILMEMBER KENG, YOUR HAND RAISED
20:04:57  ON THIS.
>> Councilmember Keng: THANK  YOU,
20:05:00  MADAME MAYOR.
SO I ALSO THANK DIRECTOR
20:05:03  PERSSELIN FOR THE REPORT AND IT'S GOOD TO SEE
20:05:06  THAT OUR GDP
20:05:09  HAD BEEN -- HAD RISEN AND SOME OF OUR
20:05:12  REVENUE ACTUALLY GREW OUT OF EXPECTATIONS
20:05:16  AS WE SEEN THE POINT IN TIME
20:05:20  COUNT, WE DO KNOW THAT THAT
20:05:23  INCREASE IN GDP IS NOT LIKE
20:05:27  PROPORTIONATE ACROSS THE BOARD FOR OUR CITIZENS.
MANY
20:05:30  PEOPLE WHO WORK IN RETAIL LOST THEIR
20:05:33  JOBS OR PEOPLE THAT HAD -- IF
20:05:36  BOTH THE PARENTS ARE WORKING IN RETAIL AND
20:05:39  THE KIDS WERE IN DISTANCE LEARNING, ONE OF THE
20:05:43  PARENTS WILL HAVE TO STAY HOME AND
20:05:46  BE LOSING THAT INCOME.
SO
20:05:49  WE SEE THE LOWER INCOME FAMILIES
20:05:52  OR SOME OF THE FAMILIES
20:05:56  IN THE UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES WOULD BE IMPACTED A LOT MORE BY THE
20:06:00  PANDEMIC.
SO I'M GLAD TO SEE
20:06:04  US WORKING ON THE HUMAN -- ON THE FAMILY SERVICE
20:06:07 S AND DIFFERENT SERVICES THAT WE'RE OFFERING FOR
20:06:11  OUR FAMILIES THAT ARE IMPACTED BY THE
20:06:14  PANDEMIC, INCLUDING THE RENT RELIEF PROGRAM AND OTHER  PROGRAMS THAT WE'RE WORKING
20:06:18  ON.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

20:06:23 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
I'LL SEE IF THERE'S ANY
20:06:26  OTHER COMMENTS FROM ANY OTHER
20:06:29  COUNCILMEMBERS.

20:06:34 SEEING NONE, THIS IS A REPORT OUT.

20:06:37  THANK DIRECTOR
20:06:40  PERSSELIN AS WELL AS ALL THE STAFF.
WE HAVE IN THE PAST CONTINUE
20:06:44 ED TO BE VERY FISCALLY SOUND
20:06:48  AND THOUGHTFUL IN TERMS OF OUR MANAGEMENT, ESPECIALLY ON STAFFING.

20:06:51 I'M GLAD TO SEE THAT, THANKS TO SOME OF THE PROGRAMS THAT
20:06:54  WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO UTILIZE FROM THE FEDERAL AND STATE LEVEL, THAT
20:06:57  WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO ADDRESS
20:07:00  THIS TIME IN TERMS OF THE
20:07:04  DOWNTURN, AND I REALLY APPRECIATE SPECIFICALLY SOME OF THE EFFORTS PUT IN BY
20:07:07  FROM OUR ECONOMIC  DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT TO
20:07:10  SUPPORT OUR SMALL BUSINESSES AND ALSO FOR OUR HUMAN SERVICES
20:07:14  DEPARTMENT.
DEFINITELY WE DID SEE SOME
20:07:17  INCREASE AND IMPACT IN DIFFERENT AREAS FOR
20:07:21  HUMAN SERVICES DEPARTMENT SO, THEREFORE, I'M GLAD THAT WE WILL
20:07:24  BE ANALYZING SOME OF THE REPORTS THAT WE JUST RECEIV
20:07:27 ED ON HOMELESSNESS AND OTHER AREAS TO HOPEFULLY ADDRESS
20:07:30  MAKING SOME GREATER INROADS IN THAT.

20:07:51  IN PARTICULAR SOME OF THE BIGGEST ONES ARE HOMELESSNESS,
20:07:54  NOT JUST THAT AREA IN TERMS OF SERVING THEM, BUT WHAT TYPES OF PROGRAM
20:07:57 S WE CAN KEEP IN TERMS OF WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT
20:08:00  TO KEEP PEOPLE EMPLOYED AND HOUSED.
SO THANK YOU ALSO TO
20:08:04  THE INFRASTRUCTURE OPTIONS THAT WE'VE BEEN IMPLEMENTING, WHICH I THINK ARE VERY
20:08:07  IMPORTANT FOR US WHEN WE LOOK AT THE OPPORTUNITY RIGHT
20:08:10  NOW AT THE FEDERAL AND STATE LEVEL OF THESE HISTORICAL
20:08:14  INVESTMENTS TO MAKE SOME GREATER INROADS IN THOSE AREAS.

20:08:17 SO HOPEFULLY AS WE'RE LOOKING THROUGH SOME OF THESE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS
