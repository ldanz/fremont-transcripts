TO SPEAK ON A MATTER WHICH IS

THIS EVENING MAY DO SO UNDER


[Captioner] 19:35:12
ORAL COMMUNICATIONS AND THE
SECTION OF PUBLIC 
COMMUNICATIONS.


[Captioner] 19:35:17
COMMUNICATIONS RECEIVED VIA
EMAIL WERE PLACED ON FILE AND
WILL BE CONSIDERED PART OF THE


[Captioner] 19:35:22
PUBLIC RECORD.
MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WISHING TO
SPEAK MAY DO SO BY CLICKING ON


[Captioner] 19:35:26
THE RAISE HAND ICON OR BY
CALLING IN AND BY DIALING 
STAR NINE.


[Captioner] 19:35:31
IF NOT NOTED ON THE ZOOM SCREEN,
PLEASE KINDLY STATE YOUR NAME
WHEN SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF AN


[Captioner] 19:35:37
ORGANIZATION, STATE THE NAME OF
THE ORGANIZATION YOU ARE
REPRESENTING, AND I'D LIKE TO


[Captioner] 19:35:40
ASK OUR CITY CLERK TO HELP WITH
US THE TIMER FOR EACH OF THE
SPEAKERS.


[Captioner] 19:35:43
THANK YOU.
SO I'M OPENING THE PUBLIC
COMMUNICATIONS, ORAL


[Captioner] 19:35:46
COMMUNICATIONS.
>> Ms. Gauthier: THE FIRST
SPEAKER IS JULIA.


[Captioner] 19:36:01
JULIA?
>> HI, CAN YOU HEAR ME?
>> Ms. Gauthier: YES.


[Captioner] 19:36:06
>> HI, MY NAME IS JULIA SHI.
ON THE TOPIC OF CONFLICT OF
INTEREST, I KNOW YOU AREN'T


[Captioner] 19:36:12
COVERING IT TODAY, BUT I JUST
WANTED TO SPEAK TO THIS.
I'D LIKE TO COMMENT ON THE 17%


[Captioner] 19:36:17
MAX RAISES THAT THE POLICE AND
FIRE PERSONNEL RECEIVED IN JULY.
WHILE I DO BELIEVE OUR FIRST


[Captioner] 19:36:22
RESPONDERS ARE ESSENTIAL, I
WANTED TO THANK COUNCILWOMAN
KASSAN FOR SPEAKING UP FOR THE


[Captioner] 19:36:26
PEOPLE OF FREMONT BY RAISING THE
QUESTION WHETHER THE MAX
DONATIONS FROM THE FREMONT


[Captioner] 19:36:34
POLICE AND FIRE UNIONS TO LILY
MEI'S SENATE CAMPAIGN INFLUENCED
HER DECISION TO MAX OUT RAISES


[Captioner] 19:36:38
WITHOUT KNOWING WHERE THE CUTS
TO FUND THEM WOULD COME FROM.
I'D LIKE TO QUESTION WHY THE


[Captioner] 19:36:42
MAYOR DIDN'T RECUSE HERSELF
GIVEN THE CONFLICT OF INTEREST
RATHER THAN ENGAGE IN WHAT CAN


[Captioner] 19:36:50
BE CONSTRUED AS USING CITY FUNDS
FOR POLITICAL QUID PRO QUO THAT
ONLY BENEFITS HER OWN POLITICAL


[Captioner] 19:36:53
ASPIRATIONS NOT THE PEOPLE OF
FREMONT.
I FEEL THE NEED TO MAKE THE


[Captioner] 19:36:57
STATEMENT AND MAYOR MEI MADE
PUBLIC COMMENTS CALLING THESE
QUESTIONS A POLITICALLY


[Captioner] 19:37:01
MOTIVATED PERSONAL ATTACK.
I WOULD LIKE TO LET HER KNOW
THAT COUNCILWOMAN KASSAN SPOKE


[Captioner] 19:37:05
FOR THE CONCERNS VOICED BY MANY
FREMONT RESIDENTS.
WE ARE YOUR CONSTITUENTS.


[Captioner] 19:37:11
NOT POLITICAL ENEMIES.
ASKING VALID QUESTIONS ABOUT THE
PRUDENCE AND INTEGRITY OF HOW


[Captioner] 19:37:15
OUR TAX MONEY IS BEING 
ALLOCATED.
FURTHERMORE, LIKE MANY FREMONT


[Captioner] 19:37:20
RESIDENTS, I WOULD LIKE TO VOICE
MY CONCERN ABOUT THE LACK OF
TRANSPARENCY REGARDING THE


[Captioner] 19:37:24
FELONY EMBEZZLEMENT CHARGES IN
REGARD TO FORMER CITY MANAGER
MARK DANAJ.


[Captioner] 19:37:29
I WOULD LIKE TO ASK CITY COUNCIL
WHETHER WE CAN EXPECT AN
INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION WITH


[Captioner] 19:37:35
FORENSIC AUDIT OF ALL FINANCIAL
ACTIVITIES, SPENDING, AND
CONTRACTS DURING DANAJ'S TENURE


[Captioner] 19:37:39
SO THE PEOPLE OF FREMONT CAN
KNOW EXACTLY HOW MUCH OF OUR
FUNDS HAVE BEEN EMBEZZLED


[Captioner] 19:37:42
THROUGH SHADY CONTRACTS,
UNNECESSARY PROJECTS, OR
OUTRIGHT THEFT.


[Captioner] 19:37:47
WE WOULD ALSO LIKE TO KNOW WHO
KNEW WHAT AND WHEN.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:38:02
>> Ms. Gauthier: THE NEXT
SPEAKER IS NAREN IMMADI.
>> HI.


[Captioner] 19:38:08
I AM NAREN IMMADI.
I'M A RESIDENT OF NILES AREA IN
CANYON HEIGHTS NEIGHBORHOOD.


[Captioner] 19:38:21
SO I WOULD LIKE TO JUST BRING UP
A TOPIC WHICH IS BASICALLY I DO
RUN DURING MY EVENINGS AND I DO


[Captioner] 19:38:34
BIKE IF NOT DAILY, AT LEAST
OFTEN, AND THEN I USE -- I
BASICALLY RIDE -- THE SIDEWALKS


[Captioner] 19:38:43
AND BIKE LANES ARE NOT CLEANED,
SO IT WOULD BE HELPFUL BECAUSE
LIKE WE HAVE THESE DEDICATED


[Captioner] 19:38:52
LINES NOW, IT WOULD BE HELPFUL
IF THEY WERE CLEANED, ESPECIALLY
APART FROM THE BIKE LANE 


[Captioner] 19:38:58
CLEANING, I NOTICE THAT THE
SIDEWALKS CLOSER TO MISSION
BOULEVARD, THEY DON'T HAVE


[Captioner] 19:39:03
ENOUGH PLACE TO WALK OR RUN
BECAUSE WHATEVER THE TREES THAT
ARE CURRENTLY THERE ON THE


[Captioner] 19:39:10
SIDEWALKS ARE SOMEHOW SO -- THAT
THEY EXTENDED THEIR BRANCHES ON
TO THE SIDEWALK AND THEY ARE


[Captioner] 19:39:17
COMPLETELY BLOCKING THE VIEW AS
WELL, SO WE HAVE TO BASICALLY
GET ON TO THE ROAD TO WALK ON


[Captioner] 19:39:26
THE SIDEWALKS AT MULTIPLE PLACE,
ESPECIALLY CLOSER TO THE SCHOOL
THAT WE HAVE FOR BLIND AND DEAF,


[Captioner] 19:39:31
SO JUST A POINT THAT I WOULD
LIKE TO GO.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:39:41
>> Ms. Gauthier: THANK YOU.
THAT'S THE LAST SPEAKER, MADAME
MAYOR.


[Captioner] 19:39:48
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
AND AT THIS TIME, I WILL CLOSE
THE PUBLIC COMMENT, ORAL


[Captioner] 19:39:53
COMMUNICATIONS PERIOD, AND I'D
LIKE TO RETURN TO THE ITEMS THAT
WERE PULLED FROM THE CONSENT


[Captioner] 19:40:00
CALENDAR.
AND THAT'S ITEM 2C, AND I
BELIEVE THAT WAS WITH


[Captioner] 19:40:17
COUNCILMEMBER COX.
>> Ms. Gauthier: THE MUTE 
BUTTON.


[Captioner] 19:40:22
>> Councilmember Cox: CAN YOU
HEAR ME NOW?
OKAY.


[Captioner] 19:40:31
THANK YOU.
I PULLED THIS AGENDA ITEM 2C,
UPDATE ON CONFLICT OF INTEREST


[Captioner] 19:40:37
CODE.
ONE OF THE THINGS -- I REALLY
APPRECIATE OUR CITY ATTORNEY


[Captioner] 19:40:44
RAFAEL ALVARADO FOR SUBMITTING
THESE CHANGES AND HAVING THIS
ABLE TO OPEN UP FOR DIALOGUE.


[Captioner] 19:40:52
I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I
WANTED TO ASK THE QUESTION, AND
THAT IS SOME OF THE OTHER


[Captioner] 19:41:00
PRACTICES, WHEN I LOOK AT OTHER
CITY OR COUNTY PRACTICES OF 
ROLLING OUT A CONFLICT OF


[Captioner] 19:41:08
INTEREST CODE, THEY USUALLY
HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE THINGS
THAT MAY BE MORE USED DURING


[Captioner] 19:41:15
PROCEEDINGS SUCH AS LIKE OUR
CITY COUNCIL MEETING.
FOR EXAMPLE, THE SECTION 18.730


[Captioner] 19:41:22
OF TITLE 2 TALKS ABOUT
DISQUALIFICATION, AND IT DEFINES
IT AS PUBLIC OFFICIALS OR


[Captioner] 19:41:28
EMPLOYEES THAT ARE DESIGNATED
POSITIONS MUST DISQUALIFY
THEMSELVES FROM MAKING OR


[Captioner] 19:41:36
PARTICIPATING IN ANY DECISION
WHICH WILL FORESEEBLY HAVE A
MATERIAL FINANCIAL EFFECT,


[Captioner] 19:41:41
DISTINGUISHED FROM THIS EFFECT
ON THE PUBLIC, AND ON ANY
REPORTABLE INTEREST OF WHETHER


[Captioner] 19:41:48
IT AN EMPLOYEE OR PUBLIC
OFFICIAL.
AND SO THE EMPLOYEES ARE THEN


[Captioner] 19:41:55
PREVENTED FROM MAKING OFFICIAL
DECISIONS, AND SO I WANTED TO
UNDERSTAND HOW COME SOME PIECES


[Captioner] 19:41:59
OF IT, YOU MAY REFERENCE THE
WHOLE THING OR JUST PARTS OF IT
IN THE SECTIONS, BUT


[Captioner] 19:42:07
UNDERSTANDING WHY WE'RE NOT
ENCOMPASSING SOME OF THE THINGS
THAT ARE MOST WIDELY PRACTICED,


[Captioner] 19:42:11
SUCH AS THE DISQUALIFICATION
BEING STATED OUT IN THIS
PARTICULAR CODE.


[Captioner] 19:42:16
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: THANK
YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION,
COUNCILMEMBER COX.


[Captioner] 19:42:23
THE PURPOSE OF THIS STAFF REPORT
IS ACTUALLY RATHER NARROW.
THE REGULATIONS ARE INCLUDED IN


[Captioner] 19:42:29
STATE LAW AND IN REGULATIONS.
WHAT WE'RE INTENDING TO DO THIS
EVENING IS TO AUGMENT THE LIST


[Captioner] 19:42:35
OF THE EMPLOYEES THAT MUST FILE
FORM 700s IN ORDER TO ALLOW
THAT TYPE OF ANALYSIS TO OCCUR,


[Captioner] 19:42:38
WHETHER AN EMPLOYEE CAN
DETERMINE AND THE CITY CAN
DETERMINE WHETHER THERE'S A


[Captioner] 19:42:43
CONFLICT OF INTEREST AND THE
NEED FOR RECUSAL FOR THESE
EMPLOYEES IN THESE PARTICULAR


[Captioner] 19:42:47
POSITIONS.
SO THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH OUR
OBLIGATIONS UNDER STATE LAW.


[Captioner] 19:42:51
WE DO IT REGULARLY EVERY COUPLE
OF YEARS, AND THIS IS JUST
ESSENTIALLY TO UPDATE THE LIST


[Captioner] 19:42:53
OF EMPLOYEES THAT HAVE TO FILE
THE FORM.
>> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.


[Captioner] 19:43:02
BUT I THINK THERE IS SOME THINGS
THAT I REALLY THINK SHOULD BE
ADDRESSED IN THERE AND TYING IT


[Captioner] 19:43:09
BESIDES WITH THE FPPC RULING,
BUT THERE'S ALSO SOME OTHER
RULES THAT ROLL INTO EFFECT THE


[Captioner] 19:43:17
GOVERNMENT CODE REFLECTING ON
81,000, AND REFERRING -- I KNOW
IT ROLLS UP TO THE POLITICAL


[Captioner] 19:43:23
REFORM ACT, BUT I THINK THERE'S
SOME THINGS THAT WE SHOULD
ADDRESS, AND MAKING SURE THAT


[Captioner] 19:43:27
EVERYONE IS CLEAR ON.
EVERYBODY THAT'S BEEN ELECTED,
YOU HAVE TO, EVERY JANUARY, WHEN


[Captioner] 19:43:33
YOU'RE ELECTED IN THE FIRST 
TERM, YOU GO THROUGH THE ETHICAL
ETHICS TRAINING, BUT WHAT I'M


[Captioner] 19:43:43
TRYING TO ASK IS THAT THERE
APPEARS TO BE AN OPEN
INCONSISTENCY IN MAKING SURE


[Captioner] 19:43:48
EVERYONE KNOWS THAT'S THE COMMON
PRACTICE OF DISQUALIFYING AND
WHY AND WHEN.


[Captioner] 19:43:53
SOME PEOPLE EVEN THOUGHT IT MAY
BE RELATED TO CONTRACTS, WHICH
IT'S NOT, AND IT'S TIED IN WITH


[Captioner] 19:43:58
ANY TYPE OF FINANCIAL INTEREST.
AND JUST MAKING SURE THOSE
THINGS ARE CLEAR IN THAT PART,


[Captioner] 19:44:05
AND THE PROVISIONS FOR
DISQUALIFICATIONS, DISQUALIFYING
YOURSELF FROM MAKING DECISION.


[Captioner] 19:44:12
ALSO THERE'S A GOVERNMENT CODE
THAT'S TIED IN WITH SECTION
9103, THAT ALSO HAS THAT TIED IN


[Captioner] 19:44:22

IN.
I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND


[Captioner] 19:44:25
HOW WE CAN MAKE THIS A LITTLE
BIT CLEARER BECAUSE OF THE --
IT'S NOT TRANSPARENT WHEN THE


[Captioner] 19:44:28
AVERAGE PERSON WHEN THEY LOOK AT
THIS CODE THAT CERTAIN THINGS
POP UP.


[Captioner] 19:44:36
WHEN I LOOK AT OTHER CITIES AND
OTHER PRACTICES, THEY HIGHLIGHT
A NUMBER OF CASES THAT COULD BE


[Captioner] 19:44:42
MOST HIGHLY USED DURING PUBLIC
MEETINGS, AND SO I WAS JUST
TRYING TO UNDERSTAND A LITTLE


[Captioner] 19:44:52
BIT MORE IN TERMS OF OURS IS A
LITTLE BIT MORE HIGHER UP AS
OPPOSED TO SHOWING SOME OF THE


[Captioner] 19:44:55
SPECIFIC COUNTS THAT CAN BE USED
AND REFERRED TO.
SO IT'S EASY FOR SOME OF OUR


[Captioner] 19:45:01
RESIDENTS THAT ARE LOOKING AT
THIS INFORMATION, THAT THEY KNOW
THAT IT'S UNDERSTOOD AND IT'S


[Captioner] 19:45:09
TRANSPARENT, AND THEY DON'T HAVE
TO BE A LAWYER, BUT THEY COULD
READ, AND INTERPRET AND


[Captioner] 19:45:12
UNDERSTAND THAT PART.
SO I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND
A LITTLE BIT MORE BECAUSE IT


[Captioner] 19:45:15
SEEMS A LITTLE DEVIANT FROM SOME
OF THE OTHER PRACTICES THAT I'VE
SEEN AROUND.


[Captioner] 19:45:21
AND IF THERE'S SOME WAY THAT WE
COULD UPLOAD SOME THINGS THAT
COULD BE MOST HIGHLY USED DURING


[Captioner] 19:45:25
OUR PUBLIC MEETINGS, THAT WOULD
BE MOST HELPFUL, AND PROVIDING
THE GUIDANCE.


[Captioner] 19:45:35
ANOTHER PART THAT ALSO HAS COME
UP IS I KNOW YOU ATTACHED THE
LIST, WHICH IS HELPFUL WITH THE


[Captioner] 19:45:42
DISCLOSURE CATEGORIES, AND IT
TALKS ABOUT CERTAIN AREAS WHERE
PEOPLE WOULD HAVE TO -- THE


[Captioner] 19:45:48
EMPLOYEES OR PUBLIC ELECTED
WOULD THEN FILL OUT THE FORM TO
DISCLOSE THEIR ACTIVITIES.


[Captioner] 19:45:56
SOME OF THE THINGS I DIDN'T SEE,
AND MAYBE IT'S UNDER YOUR TITLE
AND HEADING, WAS LIKE SECURITY


[Captioner] 19:46:04
GUARD SERVICES, THIS IS STUFF
THAT I'VE SEEN ACROSS THE BOARD
OF LISTING SPECIFIC TYPE OF


[Captioner] 19:46:11
SERVICES THAT ARE DONE OUTSIDE
OF YOUR NORMAL WORK BUT ALSO
THAT IS JUST ESTABLISHING SOME


[Captioner] 19:46:23
AREAS THAT MAY BE ADDED TO THE
CATEGORIES THAT YOU HAVE LISTED,
AND THEN I WASN'T SURE WHY YOU


[Captioner] 19:46:27
MADE A DISTINCTION OF STREET
CONSTRUCTION WHERE THERE'S JUST
CONSTRUCTION, PERIOD, IN


[Captioner] 19:46:33
CATEGORY 7F.
AND I JUST THOUGHT THAT IT'S
JUST CONSTRUCTION IS


[Captioner] 19:46:39
CONSTRUCTION AND JUST KIND OF
MAKING IT MORE GENERAL, BECAUSE
I KNOW IN OTHER COUNTIES AND


[Captioner] 19:46:47
CITY, THEY DO HAVE A PRACTICE OF
OUTSIDE EMPLOYMENT FORMS THAT WE
FILL OUT, AND IT'S OUTSIDE OF


[Captioner] 19:46:52
WHAT YOU'VE BEEN APPOINTED TO
SERVE IN A PARTICULAR ROLE
THAT'S BEEN APPROVED BY THE


[Captioner] 19:46:59
PROPER AUTHORITIES, BUT IT'S
ALSO THINGS THAT GET DISCLOSED
AS PART OF RECORD SO THERE'S NO


[Captioner] 19:47:07
CONFLICT OF INTEREST AND SO I
DIDN'T -- I WANTED TO ASK YOU
YOUR THOUGHTS ON THE OUTSIDE


[Captioner] 19:47:14
EMPLOYMENT ACTIVITIES AND SEEING
IF THAT'S SOMETHING THAT COULD
HAVE BEEN ALSO ADVISED UPON


[Captioner] 19:47:19
THERE, SO I KNOW THAT IT JUST
SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN ANOTHER
COMMON PRACTICE THAT I'VE SEEN


[Captioner] 19:47:25
AND JUST ASKING THOSE QUESTIONS.
AND YOU HAVE TO DISCLOSE IT
BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO BE PAID


[Captioner] 19:47:33
BY IT AND WHAT IS YOUR POSITION
AND ALL THE THINGS THAT ARE KIND
OF MAKING IT ALL PUBLIC


[Captioner] 19:47:37
INFORMATION.
IN THAT REGARD.
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: IN


[Captioner] 19:47:43
RESPONSE TO A COUPLE OF THE
POINTS YOU RAISED, THIS IS A
COMPLEX AREA OF LAW, CANDIDLY,


[Captioner] 19:47:50
AND FORTUNATELY, THE FPPC ON ITS
WEBSITE DOES LIST ALL OF THESE
CITATIONS THAT YOU MENTIONED


[Captioner] 19:47:55
TODAY, AND FORMS AND
EXPLANATIONS AND INSTRUCTIONS
THAT KIND OF GUIDE THE FILERS,


[Captioner] 19:48:00
AND WE COMPLY WITH THAT.
AGAIN, THIS IS JUST A NARROW
UPDATE TO THE LIST OF THE


[Captioner] 19:48:04
EMPLOYEES THAT HAVE TO COMPLY
WITH THOSE REGULATIONS, AND
GIVEN THE COMPLEXITY OF THIS


[Captioner] 19:48:08
AREA OF LAW, CERTAINLY OUR
OFFICE, THE CITY ATTORNEY'S
OFFICE REGULARLY INTERFACES WITH


[Captioner] 19:48:14
EMPLOYEES AS WELL AS
COUNCILMEMBERS WHEN THEY HAVE A
QUESTION OF WHETHER A PARTICULAR


[Captioner] 19:48:20
DECISION MAY BE IMPACTED BY
INDIVIDUAL FINANCIAL INTERESTS
AND WE'LL CONTINUE TO BE


[Captioner] 19:48:23
AVAILABLE FOR THOSE QUESTIONS.
>> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.
LET ME ASK YOU THIS.


[Captioner] 19:48:31
AS YOU ROLL OUT THE PROCESS,
WHAT IS, I GUESS, THE -- IT'S
OVERSEEN BY THE CITY ATTORNEYS?


[Captioner] 19:48:35
I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND
WHAT THE PROCESS IS WHEN THERE'S
A CONFLICT OF INTEREST.


[Captioner] 19:48:39
WHAT IS THE SET PROCESS?
BECAUSE USUALLY WHEN YOU
INTRODUCE THE CODE, YOU ALSO


[Captioner] 19:48:47
SHOULD BE INTRODUCING WHAT IS
THE PROCESS OF WHO TAKES THE
ACTION, WHO OWNS IT, WHO REPORTS


[Captioner] 19:48:52
IT OUT, WHERE IS IT REPORTED AND
UNDERSTOOD THAT EVERYONE IS IN
COMPLIANCE AND ALSO IF THERE'S


[Captioner] 19:48:57
ANY FINDINGS, HOW DOES THAT GET
REPORTED OUT?
SO I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND


[Captioner] 19:49:02
THAT, AND IF THERE'S
DISCIPLINARY ACTION, I KNOW THAT
KIND OF TIES IN WITH OUR HR


[Captioner] 19:49:12
DEPARTMENT, WITH ALLEN DEMEARS,
THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING FOR
DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS, BUT I'M


[Captioner] 19:49:17
JUST TRYING TO SEE HOW DOES THAT
ALL ENCOMPASS TOGETHER THE
PROCESS, AND THEN HOW DOES IT


[Captioner] 19:49:25
TIE IN TO OUR COUNCIL HANDBOOK
TO MAKE THAT ALSO SOMETHING
THAT'S ENFORCEABLE AND TIED


[Captioner] 19:49:29
TOGETHER?
BECAUSE I JUST DON'T SEE ALL THE
CONNECTIVITY, AND I DON'T SEE


[Captioner] 19:49:34
THE PROCESS.
SO HELP ME UNDERSTAND THIS WHOLE
PIECE HERE.


[Captioner] 19:49:39
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: THE 
FPPC REGULATIONS ESSENTIALLY
MAKE IT EACH OF OUR


[Captioner] 19:49:45
RESPONSIBILITIES, US FORM 700
FILERS, IT'S EACH OF OUR
RESPONSIBILITIES TO MONITOR OUR


[Captioner] 19:49:50
OWN FINANCIAL INTERESTS AND
ENSURE THAT WE DON'T PARTICIPATE
ON ACTIONS THAT COULD PUT THOSE


[Captioner] 19:49:56
FINANCES IN THE CROSSHAIRS OF
THE DECISION-MAKING, THE
GOVERNMENT'S DECISION-MAKING.


[Captioner] 19:50:00
SO THE STARTING POINT IS, EACH
OF US HAS TO FILE THE FORM, WE
HAVE TO LIST OUR FINANCIAL


[Captioner] 19:50:06
INTERESTS, AND IF THERE'S A
GOVERNMENT ACTION BEFORE, LET'S
SAY, THE COUNCIL OR INDIVIDUAL


[Captioner] 19:50:11
COUNCILMEMBERS, EACH OF US HAVE
TO MAKE A DETERMINATION THAT
WHEN WE HAVE OUR -- DETERMINE


[Captioner] 19:50:15
THAT WE HAVE A CONFLICT OF
INTEREST, WE HAVE TO RECUSE
OURSELVES FROM PARTICIPATION ON


[Captioner] 19:50:19
THAT ACTION.
SO HOW WOULD THAT WORK?
TYPICALLY, YOU'D LOOK AT YOUR


[Captioner] 19:50:26
FORM 700 AND IF THERE'S A POLICY
THAT MIGHT CONFLICT WITH YOUR
FINANCES, YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO


[Captioner] 19:50:31
MAKE YOUR OWN DETERMINATION IF
YOU NEED LEGAL ASSISTANCE WITH
THAT, YOU CAN COME TO OUR OFFICE


[Captioner] 19:50:35
AND OUR OFFICE CAN CERTAINLY
ASSIST WITH THAT AND THE
OBLIGATION THEN BECOMES THAT YOU


[Captioner] 19:50:41
NOT PARTICIPATE ON THAT
PARTICULAR GOVERNMENT DECISION.
IN FACT, THE FPPC REGULATIONS


[Captioner] 19:50:44
REQUIRE YOU TO DISCLOSE IF
THERE'S A CONFLICT OF INTEREST
BEFORE THE ITEM COMES UP TO


[Captioner] 19:50:48
RECUSE YOURSELF FROM
PARTICIPATION AND THEN TO ALLOW
THE OTHER COUNCILMEMBERS TO


[Captioner] 19:50:53
CONTINUE WITH THE ACTION.
SO THESE ARE INDIVIDUAL 
FACT-BASED DETERMINATIONS.


[Captioner] 19:51:00
THEY ARE SOMETIMES COMPLEX.
OUR OFFICE IS THERE TO PROVIDE
ASSISTANCE WHEN QUESTIONS DO


[Captioner] 19:51:08
ARISE, BUT IT IS ULTIMATELY EACH
OF OUR RESPONSIBILITIES TO KNOW
WHAT OUR FINANCES ARE AND


[Captioner] 19:51:12
DISCLOSE POTENTIAL CONFLICTS ON
OUR FORMS AND THEN TO RECUSE
OURSELVES WHEN THOSE CONFLICTS


[Captioner] 19:51:16
ACTUALLY ARISE IN THE CONTEXT OF
A CITY COUNCIL MEETING.
>> Councilmember Cox: NOW HOW


[Captioner] 19:51:22
WOULD YOU ADDRESS PERSONAL GAIN?
IT MAY NOT BE FINANCIAL,
SOMETIMES IT IS, SOMETIMES IT'S


[Captioner] 19:51:27
NOT.
HOW WOULD YOU ADDRESS IT IN THE
CONFLICT OF INTEREST CODE THAT


[Captioner] 19:51:31
YOU HAVE RIGHT NOW?
OF.
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: I


[Captioner] 19:51:33
MISSED THE FIRST PART OF YOUR
QUESTION.
>> Councilmember Cox: SO THE


[Captioner] 19:51:38
PERSONAL GAIN, WHETHER IT'S
DIRECT OR INDIRECT -- IT'S
DIRECT, BUT IT COULD BE INDIRECT


[Captioner] 19:51:45
THAT IT'S NOT NECESSARILY
MONETARY, BUT IT'S INFLUENCE.
HOW DO YOU ADDRESS THAT?


[Captioner] 19:51:47
IN THE CURRENT PROCESS THAT WE
HAVE?
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: THESE


[Captioner] 19:51:51
REGULATIONS SPECIFICALLY FOCUS
ON FINANCIAL CONFLICT OF
INTERESTS, AND BASED UPON THE


[Captioner] 19:51:57
KIND OF CATEGORY OF POTENTIAL
CONFLICT, WHETHER IT'S RECEIPT
OF A GIFT OR OWNERSHIP IN REAL


[Captioner] 19:52:05
ESTATE OR OWNERSHIP IN AN
INVESTMENT, DEPENDING ON THE
TYPE OF INVESTMENT AND THE TYPE


[Captioner] 19:52:10
OF GIFT OR REAL ESTATE, YOU MAY
HAVE TO RECUSE YOURSELF.
I MEAN, IT REALLY IS A 


[Captioner] 19:52:14
FACT-BASED DETERMINATION THAT
REQUIRES YOU TO LOOK AT THE FORM
AND DETERMINE WHETHER YOU HAVE A


[Captioner] 19:52:21
PARTICULAR FINANCIAL CONFLICT
WITH RESPECT TO A PARTICULAR
GOVERNMENT DECISION.


[Captioner] 19:52:25
>> Councilmember Cox: BUT WHERE
IS IT THAT THERE IS MAYBE NOT
NECESSARILY ON THE FINANCIAL


[Captioner] 19:52:33
INTEREST BUT NON-FINANCIAL WITH
INTEREST THAT IS THE INDIRECT
PART, HOW IS THAT DIFFERENT AND


[Captioner] 19:52:38
HANDLED?
IF YOU'RE STILL ROUTING THROUGH
THE FPPC OR DO YOU DO A 


[Captioner] 19:52:41
SELF-DISCLOSURE?
I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND
THAT ASPECT OF IT.


[Captioner] 19:52:47
BECAUSE THEY DO ALLOW YOU TO
SELF-DISCLOSE.
>> THE FPPC REGULATIONS ONLY


[Captioner] 19:52:49
ADDRESS FINANCIAL CONFLICTS OF
INTEREST.
THAT IS THE SCOPE OF INQUIRY


[Captioner] 19:52:53
WHEN IT COMES TO WHETHER A
COUNCILMEMBER HAS TO RECUSE
THEMSELVES FROM A PARTICULAR


[Captioner] 19:52:57
GOVERNMENT DECISION.
>> Councilmember Cox: IS THERE
ANY PROCESS BEING THOUGHT ABOUT


[Captioner] 19:53:04
THAT TIES IN WITH OUR STANDARDS
OF CONDUCT AS CITY EMPLOYEES OR
DIFFERENT THINGS LIKE THAT, THAT


[Captioner] 19:53:12
WOULD HAVE A SEPARATE PROCESS
THAT YOU'RE SAYING FPPC IS MORE
ON THE FINANCIAL SIDE.


[Captioner] 19:53:16
WHAT IF IT'S NOT ON THE
FINANCIAL SIDE, HOW IS IT BEST
TO ADDRESS THAT?


[Captioner] 19:53:23
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: THAT'S
A VERY BROAD QUESTION, BUT OTHER
THAN COMPLIANCE WITH STATE LAW,


[Captioner] 19:53:28
OUR OFFICE HASN'T BEEN DIRECTED
TO DO ANYTHING IN ADDITION TO
WHAT THE FPPC REGULATIONS


[Captioner] 19:53:32
REQUIRE, AND THE SCOPE OF
TONIGHT'S ACTION IS REALLY JUST
TO UPDATE THE LIST TO MAKE SURE


[Captioner] 19:53:37
THAT THE EMPLOYEES THAT COULD
HAVE A POTENTIAL CONFLICT OF
INTEREST ARE LISTED AND COMPLY


[Captioner] 19:53:41
WITH FPPC REGULATIONS.
>> Councilmember Cox: SO THIS IS
MORE OF A FINANCIAL 


[Captioner] 19:53:48
INTEREST-BASED TYPE RULING THAT
YOU'RE PASSING THROUGH FOR THE
CONFLICT OF INTEREST, IS WHAT


[Captioner] 19:53:56
I'M HEARING THAT'S TIED TO THE 
FPPC AND THERE'S NO OTHER WAY OF
SPLITTING IT OUT FROM 


[Captioner] 19:54:01
NON-FINANCIAL FOR FINANCIAL.
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: CORRECT
THIS ACTION TONIGHT IS BASED


[Captioner] 19:54:05
UPON STATE LAW REQUIREMENTS
UNDER FPPC REGULATIONS.
>> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.


[Captioner] 19:54:13
NOW, LET ME ASK YOU THIS.
FOR OUR COUNCIL HANDBOOK, DOES
IT REFERENCE BACK TO THE


[Captioner] 19:54:20
CONFLICT OF CODE REFERENCE IN
OUR HANDBOOK?
BECAUSE I DIDN'T SEE THAT IN


[Captioner] 19:54:27
THERE CURRENTLY, WHAT'S IN THE
CURRENT VERSION THAT'S LATER ON
IN THE AGENDA 7A.


[Captioner] 19:54:30
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: NOT
WITH THE LEVEL OF SPECIFICITY
THAT YOU WOULD DEAL WITH IN THE


[Captioner] 19:54:36
WORLD OF FPPC REGULATIONS.
FRANKLY THE REGULATIONS ARE
EXPANSIVE, AND THE RULES ARE


[Captioner] 19:54:43
EXPANSIVE, SO IT WOULDN'T MAKE
ADMINISTRATIVE SENSE TO INCLUDE
ALL THOSE REGULATIONS WITHIN THE


[Captioner] 19:54:48
HANDBOOK, BUT WE'RE STILL
REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH FPPC
REGULATIONS AND THESE EMPLOYEES


[Captioner] 19:54:54
THAT ARE LISTED ON TONIGHT'S
STAFF REPORT ARE REQUIRED TO
COMPLY WITH THE FORM 700


[Captioner] 19:54:57
REQUIREMENTS.
>> Councilmember Cox: RIGHT.
AND I DO REALIZE THERE IS A


[Captioner] 19:55:02
DISTINCTION OF RULES OF THE
EMPLOYEES AND BEING ON CITY
COUNCIL AS WELL, SO I KNOW THE


[Captioner] 19:55:07
COUNCIL HANDBOOK IS A LITTLE
DIFFERENT AND SEPARATE BECAUSE
OF THE SCOPE OF WORK AND


[Captioner] 19:55:14
RESPONSIBILITIES.
SO THIS IS REALLY FINANCIAL TIED
FOR THE EMPLOYEES FOR THE CITY


[Captioner] 19:55:18
OF FREMONT.
TO DISTINGUISH IT.
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: CORRECT


[Captioner] 19:55:24
IT LISTS THE EMPLOYEES THAT ARE
REQUIRED TO FILL THE FORM 700
ANNUALLY IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY


[Captioner] 19:55:27

POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST.
>> Councilmember Cox: AND IF


[Captioner] 19:55:32
THERE'S ANYTHING THAT CONFLICTS
WITH ANYTHING ELSE FOR OUTSIDE
EMPLOYMENT THAT THEY ALSO HAVE


[Captioner] 19:55:39
SOME WAY OF CLEARANCE THAT ALL
THE EMPLOYEES ARE OKAY AND THAT
IF THERE'S ANY ERISA CONFLICT,


[Captioner] 19:55:45
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN DEALT WITH
SO EVERYBODY IS -- FROM BASED ON
THIS, THIS IS THE EXHAUSTIVE


[Captioner] 19:55:49
LIST OF OTHER AREAS THAT PEOPLE
WOULD HAVE TO REPORT THEIR
INCOME?


[Captioner] 19:55:54
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: YELL,
WELL, THIS LIST ENCAPSULATES ALL
OF THE EMPLOYEES THAT ARE


[Captioner] 19:55:59
REQUIRED TO FILL OUT THE FORM
700 AS REQUIRED UNDER THE FPPC
REGULATIONS.


[Captioner] 19:56:02
>> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: IT
DOESN'T ADDRESS OUTSIDE


[Captioner] 19:56:05
EMPLOYMENT.
THERE ARE OTHER PERSONNEL RULES
AND PROCEDURES THAT GOVERN THAT


[Captioner] 19:56:08
ASPECT OF YOUR QUESTION, BUT IN
TERMS OF THE FINANCIAL CONFLICT
OF INTEREST, THESE ARE THE


[Captioner] 19:56:12
POSITIONS THAT WILL BE REQUIRED
TO FILL OUT THE FORM.
>> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.


[Captioner] 19:56:17
FOR THAT PART.
BUT THINK ABOUT THE OUTSIDE, IN
CASE THERE'S OTHER -- THAT EVER


[Captioner] 19:56:25
COMES INTO A CONFLICT OR
EVERYBODY IS CLEAR ON, THAT
WOULD BE THE OTHER PART THAT


[Captioner] 19:56:30
WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THAT ENHANCED
TO COVER THAT AREA JUST IN CASE.
I'M SURE EVERYBODY IS GOOD, BUT


[Captioner] 19:56:35
IT'S ALWAYS GOOD JUST TO HAVE
THOSE THINGS IN PLACE JUST IN
CASE.


[Captioner] 19:56:42
OKAY.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
>> Mayor Mei: COUNCILMEMBER


[Captioner] 19:56:46
SALWAN, I SAW YOU PRESSED THE
BUTTON.
>> Vice Mayor Salwan: THANK YOU,


[Captioner] 19:56:48
MADAME MAYOR.
COUNCILMEMBER COX, JUST TO
CLARIFY, ARE YOU CONCERNED ABOUT


[Captioner] 19:56:52
THE EMPLOYEES' CONFLICT OF
INTEREST OR CITY COUNCIL?
OR BOTH?


[Captioner] 19:56:58
I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY WHERE
YOUR CONCERN AROSE.
>> Councilmember Cox: I'M JUST


[Captioner] 19:57:03
LOOKING AT THE DIFFERENT
PRACTICES ACROSS THE BOARD, AND
JUST SEEING LIKE WHAT'S THE BEST


[Captioner] 19:57:07
PRACTICES OUT THERE AND JUST
KIND OF QUESTIONING BECAUSE I'VE
WORKED FOR A LOT OF DIFFERENT


[Captioner] 19:57:16
GOVERNMENT ENTITIES, AND SOME
THINGS HOLD UNTIL YOU DIE, SOME
OF THE ETERNAL STANDARDS.


[Captioner] 19:57:21
AND THEN OTHERS HAVE FORMS 
DEALING WITH DIFFERENT
SITUATIONS.


[Captioner] 19:57:30
I'M NOT SAYING ANYTHING, IT'S
JUST I'M JUST UNDERSTANDING THE
CONTENT AND HOW IT'S BEING


[Captioner] 19:57:33
APPLIED ACROSS THE BOARD.
THAT'S IT.
>> Vice Mayor Salwan: OKAY.


[Captioner] 19:57:40
AND MR. ALVARADO, SO I NOTICE
CITY COUNCIL AND CITY MANAGER
WERE NOT ON THIS LIST.


[Captioner] 19:57:49
IS THAT BECAUSE THAT'S ALREADY
COVERED BY STATE LAW AND FPPC
REQUIREMENTS?


[Captioner] 19:57:55
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: THE
POSITION OF CITY MANAGER AND
CITY COUNCILMEMBERS ARE ALL


[Captioner] 19:57:58
SUBJECT TO FPPC REGULATIONS
REGARDING FINANCIAL CONFLICT OF
INTEREST.


[Captioner] 19:58:05
>> Vice Mayor Salwan: AND THE 
FPPC IS THE RULING BODY ON THOSE
ISSUES AND CAN CLARIFY IF


[Captioner] 19:58:11
ANYBODY HAS ANY CONCERNS OR
SOMEBODY HAS A COMPLAINT THAT'S
A VENUE AVAILABLE TO FOLKS?


[Captioner] 19:58:16
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: CORRECT
THE FPPC IS REALLY THE ONLY
ENTITY THAT CAN IMMUNIZE


[Captioner] 19:58:23
COUNCILMEMBERS FROM MISTAKES
THAT MAY COME FROM PARTICIPATING
IN DECISIONS WHERE THEY HAVE A


[Captioner] 19:58:28
CONFLICT OF INTEREST.
SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO BOTH
UNDERSTAND THE FPPC REGULATIONS


[Captioner] 19:58:33
BUT ALSO TO REACH OUT TO THE 
FPPC ITSELF WHEN THERE'S A
SPECIFIC QUESTION THAT MAY


[Captioner] 19:58:35
IMPACT AN INDIVIDUAL
COUNCILMEMBER'S ABILITY TO
PARTICIPATE.


[Captioner] 19:58:41
>> Vice Mayor Salwan: AND AS A
CITY, I THINK WE HAVE A POLICY
FOR ETHICS TRAINING REQUIREMENT


[Captioner] 19:58:47
EVERY FEW YEARS?
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: EVERY
TWO YEARS AS I UNDERSTAND.


[Captioner] 19:58:53
>> Ms. Gauthier: YES, THAT'S
CORRECT.
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN, I JUST


[Captioner] 19:59:00
WANTED TO POINT OUT THE
COUNCILMEMBERS AND THE 87200
FILER, GOVERNMENT CODE 87200,


[Captioner] 19:59:09
THE FPPC BEING THE AUTHORITY
REGULATES THAT UNDER 87200 AND
YOU'RE ACTUALLY COUNCILMEMBERS


[Captioner] 19:59:11
AND CERTAIN CITY EMPLOYEES ARE
ACTUALLY LISTED ON THE LAST 
PAGE.


[Captioner] 19:59:16
YOU'RE NOT LISTED ON ONE OF THE
FIRST FIVE OR SIX PAGE, YOU'RE
LISTED ON THE LAST PAGE OF THE


[Captioner] 19:59:19
DESIGNATED POSITIONS.
>> Vice Mayor Salwan: OKAY.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:59:25
I'D LIKE TO MOVE THIS FORWARD IF
THERE'S NO OTHER COMMENTS?
>> Mayor Mei: I WAS GOING TO 


[Captioner] 19:59:29
ASK, I SAW SOME EARLIER BUT I
COULDN'T TELL IF IT WAS FROM
BEFORE BECAUSE WE HAD SOME


[Captioner] 19:59:32
TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES.
YOU PRESSED THE BUTTON --
>> Ms. Gauthier: WE HAVE A


[Captioner] 19:59:37
PUBLIC SPEAKER AS WELL.
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY.
>> Councilmember Kassan: I DID


[Captioner] 19:59:43
PRESS THE BUTTON.
>> Mayor Mei: THAT'S WHY I
WASN'T SURE, THERE WERE THREE OR


[Captioner] 19:59:46
FOUR BEFORE BUT YOU DON'T SHOW
UP RIGHT NOW.
YES, COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN.


[Captioner] 19:59:51
>> Councilmember Kassan: OKAY.
I HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS.
ONE, IT'S FUNNY BUT -- AND I


[Captioner] 19:59:57
KNOW I SHOULD PROBABLY KNOW 
THIS, BUT THERE'S THIS REFERENCE
TO FREMONT'S CONFLICT OF


[Captioner] 20:00:01
INTEREST CODE, BUT I DON'T FIND
THAT ANYWHERE.
I MEAN, IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE IN


[Captioner] 20:00:08
THE MUNICIPAL CODE, THERE'S NO
LINK TO IT.
IS IT JUST THESE APPENDICES?


[Captioner] 20:00:14
WHERE IS THE FREMONT CONFLICT OF
INTEREST CODE?
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: WE


[Captioner] 20:00:18
INCORPORATE THE REGULATIONS BY
REFERENCE.
>> Councilmember Kassan: AND


[Captioner] 20:00:24
WHERE IS THAT WRITTEN DOWN SO
PEOPLE COULD SEE IT?
>> Ms. Gauthier: IT'S ADOPTED BY


[Captioner] 20:00:27
RESOLUTION, BUT I COULD PULL UP
THE INFORMATION AND SEND TO YOU
IF YOU'D LIKE.


[Captioner] 20:00:32
>> Councilmember Kassan: OKAY.
IT'S JUST -- YOU KNOW, I KNOW
THAT PEOPLE ARE A BIT CONCERNED


[Captioner] 20:00:36
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED WITH OUR
FORMER CITY MANAGER AND
WONDERING ABOUT CONFLICTS OF


[Captioner] 20:00:42
INTEREST THAT HE MAY HAVE HAD
AND I KNOW THAT'S NOTHING TO DO
WITH THIS ITEM TONIGHT, SO I


[Captioner] 20:00:48
DON'T WANT TO GO OFF TOPIC, BUT
I THINK IT'S AT THE TOP OF MIND
FOR MANY PEOPLE RIGHT NOW, SO I


[Captioner] 20:00:51
THINK IT WOULD BE GOOD TO BE
MORE TRANSPARENT ABOUT WHAT THE
CONFLICT OF INTEREST


[Captioner] 20:00:58
REQUIREMENTS ARE AS THEY RELATE
TO CITY EMPLOYEES, INCLUDING THE
CITY MANAGER, INCLUDING FORMER


[Captioner] 20:01:04
CITY MANAGERS, AND 
COUNCILMEMBERS.
RIGHT NOW THERE'S REALLY NO -- I


[Captioner] 20:01:09
MEAN, I'M A COUNCILMEMBER AND I
COULDN'T FIND IT ANYWHERE IN OUR
DOCUMENTS, SO I THINK IT WOULD


[Captioner] 20:01:14
BE HELPFUL AS A STARTING POINT
TO GET -- TO BE MORE TRANSPARENT
ABOUT THAT TOPIC.


[Captioner] 20:01:28
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
AND THERE WAS A PUBLIC SPEAKER.
ON THIS ITEM?


[Captioner] 20:01:32
>> Ms. Gauthier: IT APPEARS
THEY'VE LOWERED THEIR HAND NOW.
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY.


[Captioner] 20:01:37
SO WE HAVE A MOTION BY
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN.
>> Councilmember Jones: I WILL


[Captioner] 20:01:39
SECOND.
>> Mayor Mei: SECONDED BY
COUNCILMEMBER -- DO YOU STILL


[Captioner] 20:01:43
HAVE A COMMENT?
I JUST SAW YOUR NAME COME UP.
>> Councilmember Keng: SO I DO


[Captioner] 20:01:50
ECHO THE SENTIMENT OF
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, IF WE CAN
MAKE IT MORE TRANSPARENT FOR ALL


[Captioner] 20:01:54
THE GENERAL PUBLIC WHERE THAT'S
REFERENCED AT BEFORE WE VOTE ON
THIS ITEM.


[Captioner] 20:02:00
SO WE MAY HAVE TO --
>> Mayor Mei: WE HAVE A MOTION
AND SECOND.


[Captioner] 20:02:06
I THINK OUR CITY CLERK MENTIONED
THAT IT'S IN THE RESOLUTION AND
TO SEND A COPY.


[Captioner] 20:02:10
IS THERE ANY OTHER COMMENTS FROM
OUR CITY ATTORNEY?
>> Councilmember Kassan: IT'S


[Captioner] 20:02:15
NOT IN THE RESOLUTION.
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: MY
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT PAST CITY


[Captioner] 20:02:20
RESOLUTIONS HAVE INCORPORATED 
FPPC REGULATIONS BY REFERENCE.
THAT'S WHY IT'S NOT ATTACHED TO


[Captioner] 20:02:24
THE RESOLUTION.
TONIGHT'S RESOLUTION MAKES
REFERENCE TO THAT INCORPORATION


[Captioner] 20:02:29
BY REFERENCE, SO WHAT'S THE
EASIEST WAY TO OBTAIN THIS
INFORMATION, IS ACTUALLY JUST TO


[Captioner] 20:02:34
GO TO THE FPPC WEBSITE, WHICH
CONTAINS ALL THE REGULATIONS.
WE'VE INCORPORATED ALL THOSE


[Captioner] 20:02:38
REGULATIONS.
ANOTHER THING THAT WE CAN DO,
CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT CITY


[Captioner] 20:02:43
STAFF COULD DO AND I WOULD DEFER
TO THE CITY MANAGER'S OFFICE,
BUT IS INCLUDE LINKS ON OUR OWN


[Captioner] 20:02:48
WEBSITES, THAT WAY PEOPLE KNOW
WHERE TO ACCESS THE INFORMATION,
HOWL TO GET FROM OUR OWN LOCAL


[Captioner] 20:02:53
WEBSITE TO THOSE FPPC
REGULATIONS THAT ARE APPLICABLE
TO THESE EMPLOYEES.


[Captioner] 20:03:00
>> Mayor Mei: I HAVE A MOTION
AND A SECOND AND I DON'T KNOW IF
THAT'S CLARIFICATION, THERE'S


[Captioner] 20:03:05
ALREADY BEEN DEFINED BY OUR CITY
ATTORNEY.
AND SO I'D LIKE TO CALL THE 


[Captioner] 20:03:13
VOTE.
WOULD YOU LIKE TO MAKE AN
AMENDMENT, THOUGH, JUST IN 


[Captioner] 20:03:16
CASE -- TO CLARIFY --
>> Vice Mayor Salwan: YES, I
WOULD LIKE TO INCORPORATE THE


[Captioner] 20:03:23
CITY ATTORNEY'S RECOMMENDATIONS.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
DO WE HAVE THE SECOND TO THE


[Captioner] 20:03:24
AMENDMENT?
YES.
ROLL CALL, PLEASE.


[Captioner] 20:03:30
>> Ms. Gauthier: WE'RE ALL IN
CHAMBERS TONIGHT SO YOU CAN USE
YOUR VOTING DEVICE.


[Captioner] 20:03:35
>> Mayor Mei: OH, YES, WE CAN
JUST VOTE TONIGHT.
AYE, NAY AND ABSTAIN.


[Captioner] 20:03:51
SO IF YOU'D PRESS THAT, PLEASE.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
IT'S MOTIONED AND SECONDED AND


[Captioner] 20:03:54
PASSES UNANIMOUSLY.
THAT'S THE FIRST TIME WE'VE SEEN
THAT ON THE NEW SYSTEM.


[Captioner] 20:04:08
THANK YOU.
NEXT ON OUR COUNCIL AGENDA THIS
EVENING IS RETURNING TO 


[Captioner] 20:04:13
ITEM 8A -- I MEAN  A, REVISED
CITY COUNCIL HANDBOOK OF RULES
AND PROCEDURES.


[Captioner] 20:04:21
THERE IS NO FORMAL PRESENTATION
THIS EVENING, BUT OUR CITY
ATTORNEY RAFAEL ALVARADO WILL BE


[Captioner] 20:04:25
AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS AND
COMMENTS.
AND LET'S -- FIRST ARE THERE ANY


[Captioner] 20:04:28
CLARIFYING QUESTIONS FROM THE
COUNCILMEMBERS BEFORE I OPEN UP
THE PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD?


[Captioner] 20:04:41
COUNCILMEMBER KENG, IS THIS FROM
EARLIER OR JUST NOW WHERE YOU'RE
ASKING FOR CLARIFYING COMMENT ON


[Captioner] 20:04:45
THIS ITEM, THE HANDBOOK?
NO?
OKAY.


[Captioner] 20:04:52
AND I ALSO SAW COUNCILMEMBER
SHAO BUT I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S
FROM BEFORE TOO?


[Captioner] 20:04:55
SHAO NO.
>> Mayor Mei: LET'S GO TO THE
PUBLIC SPEAKERS IF THERE ARE ANY


[Captioner] 20:05:00
ON THIS ITEM, PLEASE.
>> Ms. Gauthier: WE HAVE
THREE -- IS IT 3 MINUTES?


[Captioner] 20:05:03
>> Mayor Mei: SURE, THAT'S FINE.
>> Ms. Gauthier: WE CURRENTLY
HAVE FIVE.


[Captioner] 20:05:08
I BELIEVE IT'S FIVE SPEAKERS.
>> Councilmember Kassan: I THINK
SOME OF OUR BUTTONS AREN'T


[Captioner] 20:05:11
WORKING WITH THE REQUEST TO
SPEAK.
>> Mayor Mei: THAT'S WHAT I WAS


[Captioner] 20:05:14
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT.
I HAD SOME EARLIER AND THEY ALL
DISAPPEARED.


[Captioner] 20:05:21
>> Councilmember Kassan: BECAUSE
I KNOW I DID HAVE A CLARIFYING
QUESTION, I'M NOT SURE IF


[Captioner] 20:05:25
COUNCILMEMBER JONES DID.
>> Mayor Mei: YOU HAVE A 
CLARIFYING QUESTION BEFORE WE


[Captioner] 20:05:27
BEGIN?
>> Councilmember Kassan: YEAH.
I WANTED TO GET SOME


[Captioner] 20:05:31
CLARIFICATION AROUND THE
QUESTION OF PULLING ITEMS FROM
THE CONSENT CALENDAR.


[Captioner] 20:05:42
WHAT EXACTLY IS BEING CHANGED?
IT'S NOT SUPER CLEAR TO ME WHAT
THE DIFFERENCE IS BETWEEN WHAT


[Captioner] 20:05:47
WE'VE BEEN DOING AND WHAT THE
PROPOSED CHANGE IS.
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: THANK


[Captioner] 20:05:53
YOU FOR THAT QUESTION,
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN.
THE ONE CHANGE IS THAT UNDER THE


[Captioner] 20:05:59
REVISED PROCEDURES, IF ADOPTED
BY THE CITY COUNCIL, ONLY
COUNCILMEMBERS WOULD BE ABLE TO


[Captioner] 20:06:04
PULL ITEMS OFF OF THE CONSENT
CALENDAR ITSELF.
MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WOULD


[Captioner] 20:06:10
STILL BE ABLE TO SPEAK ON THE
CONSENT CALENDAR GENERALLY AND
ON SPECIFIC ITEMS PULLED, BUT


[Captioner] 20:06:15
FOR GOVERNANCE PURPOSES, ONLY
CITY COUNCILMEMBERS WOULD BE
ALLOWED TO PULL ITEMS OFF THE


[Captioner] 20:06:20
AGENDA.
>> Councilmember Kassan: OKAY.
I'M SORRY, ONE OTHER CLARIFYING


[Captioner] 20:06:24
QUESTION AND THAT HAS TO DO WITH
PROCLAMATIONS.
I KNOW WE'RE NOT REALLY CHANGING


[Captioner] 20:06:32
OUR POLICY ON PROCLAMATIONS, BUT
DOES THIS -- SOMETIMES
PROCLAMATIONS ARE READ AT THE


[Captioner] 20:06:37
COUNCIL, AND THEN SOMETIMES
THERE ARE RESOLUTIONS AND
PROCLAMATIONS, I DON'T KNOW THE


[Captioner] 20:06:42
EXACT CORRECT NAME FOR THEM,
THAT ARE BROUGHT TO EVENTS OR
BROUGHT TO GROUPS THAT DON'T


[Captioner] 20:06:49
EVEN COME BEFORE THE COUNCIL AT
ALL.
DOES THIS POLICY ENCOMPASS ALL


[Captioner] 20:06:53
OF THOSE OR JUST ONES THAT
ACTUALLY ARE READ AT THE CITY
COUNCIL MEETINGS?


[Captioner] 20:07:01
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: THIS
POLICY ACTUALLY DOESN'T CHANGE
ANYTHING SUBSTANTIVELY WITH


[Captioner] 20:07:09
RESPECT TO HOW THE CITY COUNCIL
PRESENTS RESOLUTIONS.
ALL IT DOES IS REMOVE CEREMONIAL


[Captioner] 20:07:14
RESOLUTIONS IN ORDER THAT WE
DON'T HAVE TO COMPLY WITH VOTING
REQUIREMENTS AS AN OFFICIAL


[Captioner] 20:07:17
RESOLUTION.
>> Councilmember Kassan: RIGHT,
I TOTALLY GET THAT PART, BUT


[Captioner] 20:07:23
JUST -- I THINK I WAS -- I KNOW
NOTHING'S CHANGING BUT I
REALIZED I WASN'T CLEAR ON THE


[Captioner] 20:07:33
POLICY, WHETHER THE POLICY IS
REFERRING ONLY TO THESE TYPES OF
ITEMS THAT OCCUR AT CITY COUNCIL


[Captioner] 20:07:38
MEETINGS OR IS IT ALSO REFERRING
TO ITEMS THAT MAYBE ARE BROUGHT
TO OTHER EVENTS IN OTHER


[Captioner] 20:07:42
COMMUNITIES OR AT COMMUNITY
EVENTS, THINGS LIKE THAT?
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: IN


[Captioner] 20:07:48
TERMS OF THE APPROVAL PROCESS,
IT APPLIES TO ALL FORMS OF
CEREMONIAL ITEMS.


[Captioner] 20:07:53
>> Councilmember Kassan: OKAY,
THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: CLARIFYING


[Captioner] 20:07:58
QUESTIONS?
I SEE ALSO COUNCILMEMBER YANG
SHAO AND COUNCILMEMBER JONES, SO


[Captioner] 20:08:02
I THINK THE BUTTONS ARE WORKING.
FIRST WE'LL BEGIN WITH
COUNCILMEMBER SHAO.


[Captioner] 20:08:06
>> Councilmember Shao: THANK
YOU, MADAME MAYOR.
I HAVE A QUESTION REGARDING THE


[Captioner] 20:08:11
CLOSED SESSION.
IT SEEMS THAT THERE'S NO
SPECIFIC MENTIONING ABOUT THE


[Captioner] 20:08:19
CLOSED SESSION IN TERMS OF THE
VOTING POWER OF ALL THE CITY
COUNCILMEMBERS, SO IS IT


[Captioner] 20:08:26
WORTHWHILE TO ADD A SENTENCE
WHICH SAYS THE VOTING POWER OF
THE EACH AND EVERY CITY


[Captioner] 20:08:34
COUNCILMEMBER INCLUDING THE
MAYOR WOULD STAND THE SAME FOR
BOTH THE OPEN SESSION AND CLOSED


[Captioner] 20:08:43
SESSION, IN OTHER WORDS, ONE
PERSON, ONE VOTE, THAT'S JUST A
QUESTION FROM ME.


[Captioner] 20:08:51
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: THANK
YOU FOR THE QUESTION.
THE AMENDED LANGUAGE ON THE


[Captioner] 20:08:55
AGENDA FORMAT DOES NOT ADDRESS
SUBSTANTIVELY HOW THE CITY
COUNCIL VOTES IN CLOSED SESSION.


[Captioner] 20:08:58
THAT'S GOVERNED BY THE
GOVERNMENT CODE AND THE BROWN
ACT.


[Captioner] 20:09:04
ALL THIS DOES IS BASICALLY
INCLUDE IN THE AGENDA FORMAT THE
REPORTING OUT REQUIREMENT OF THE


[Captioner] 20:09:08
BROWN ACT WHERE THE CITY
ATTORNEY IS REQUIRED TO REPORT
OUT CERTAIN ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE


[Captioner] 20:09:13
COUNCIL AS A BODY IN CLOSED
SESSION, AND WE'RE ADDING TO
ENSURE THAT THAT OCCURS EVERY


[Captioner] 20:09:19
TIME WE HAVE A CLOSED SESSION.
>> Councilmember Shao: MY SECOND
QUESTION IS STILL REGARDING THE


[Captioner] 20:09:27
CLOSED SESSION.
SO UNDERSTANDING THAT TODAY IS
ONLY ABOUT THE AGENDA ITEMS, BUT


[Captioner] 20:09:36
I TAKE IT THAT FOR THE CLOSED
SESSION, IT IS BY THE BROWN ACT
AND ALSO THE C. PENAL CODE THAT


[Captioner] 20:09:45
THE DISCLOSURE OF THE CLOSED
SESSION CONTENT WOULD INVOKE THE
BROWN ACT OR THE CALIFORNIA


[Captioner] 20:09:51
PENAL CODE PUNISHMENT, CORRECT?
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: YES,
THIS DOES NOT CHANGE ANY OF THE


[Captioner] 20:09:56
REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE BROWN ACT
INCLUDING THE TREAT MMENT OF
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION AND


[Captioner] 20:09:59
MATERIAL THAT IS DISCUSSED
WITHIN CLOSED SESSION.
FURTHERMORE, THE CITY ATTORNEY


[Captioner] 20:10:04
IS ONLY AUTHORIZED TO REPORT OUT
INFORMATION FROM CLOSED SESSION
THAT IS EITHER SPECIFICALLY


[Captioner] 20:10:07
REQUIRED UNDER THE BROWN ACT
ITSELF OR AS DIRECTED BY THE
CITY COUNCIL.


[Captioner] 20:10:15
>> Councilmember Shao: AND I
DIDN'T, YOU KNOW, LOOK AT IT AS
THOROUGHLY AS I FIRST READ IT.


[Captioner] 20:10:23
I ADMIT, BUT I COULDN'T FIND ANY
REGULATION REGARDING USING THE
ELECTRONIC PERSONAL DEVICES LIKE


[Captioner] 20:10:32
CELL PHONE OR LAPTOP DURING THE
COUNCIL MEETING THAT HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH THE AGENDA ITEMS.


[Captioner] 20:10:36
IS THERE ANY REGULATION ADDED
FOR THAT?
I KNOW THAT THIS ISSUE WAS


[Captioner] 20:10:42
BROUGHT UP AGAIN AND AGAIN IN
OUR ANNUAL RETREAT.
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: THE


[Captioner] 20:10:46
BROWN ACT REALLY IS WHERE THAT
ISSUE WAS ADDRESSED ITSELF AND
OF COURSE WE ALL HAVE TO COMPLY


[Captioner] 20:10:51
WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE
BROWN ACT.
WHEN WE'RE IN MEETINGS, WE'RE


[Captioner] 20:10:57
NOT ALLOWED TO COMMUNICATE VIA
TECHNOLOGICAL MEANS IN WAYS THAT
VIOLATE THE BROWN ACT, INCLUDING


[Captioner] 20:11:02
SERIAL MEETINGS BETWEEN
INDIVIDUAL COUNCILMEMBERS, ALL
DISCUSSIONS AT PUBLIC MEETINGS


[Captioner] 20:11:06
HAVE TO HAPPEN IN FRONT OF THE
PUBLIC IN ORDER THAT THEY
UNDERSTAND HOW THE COUNCIL IS


[Captioner] 20:11:09
DELIBERATING AND MAKING POLICY.
>> Councilmember Shao: THANK
YOU.


[Captioner] 20:11:16
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
NEXT IS COUNCILMEMBER JONES.
CLARIFYING QUESTIONS.


[Captioner] 20:11:20
>> Councilmember Jones: THANK
YOU, MADAME MAYOR.
JUST TO ADD ON TO THAT, IT IS


[Captioner] 20:11:24
COVERED IN OUR COUNCIL HANDBOOK
AS WELL THAT THE USE OF
ELECTRONIC DEVICES IS STRONGLY


[Captioner] 20:11:31
DISCOURAGED, SO THE ONLY
QUESTION I HAD WAS KIND OF A
FOLLOW-UP ON COUNCILMEMBER


[Captioner] 20:11:35
KASSAN.
SO WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THE
ABILITY FOR THE COUNCILMEMBERS


[Captioner] 20:11:42
TO PULL ITEMS FROM CONSENT, BUT
THE PUBLIC WILL STILL HAVE THE
ABILITY TO COMMENT ON THOSE 


[Captioner] 20:11:46
ITEMS, BUT HAVE WE DECIDED WHERE
YET?
IS IT IN ORAL COMMUNICATIONS, IS


[Captioner] 20:11:51
IT WHEN WE VOTE ON THE CONSENT
CALENDAR, WHERE EXACTLY IS THAT
PUBLIC COMMENT GOING TO COME IN?


[Captioner] 20:11:55
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: IN
ORDER TO COMPLY WITH THE BROWN
ACT, THE PUBLIC SHOULD BE


[Captioner] 20:12:02
ALLOWED TO SPEAK AT THE TOP OF
CONSENT CALENDAR FOR ITEMS THAT
ARE NOT PULLED AND, AGAIN, FOR


[Captioner] 20:12:06
ANY ITEMS THAT ARE PULLED.
SO THOSE WOULD BE THE TWO
OPPORTUNITIES THAT THE PUBLIC


[Captioner] 20:12:09
WOULD STILL BE ALLOWED TO
COMMENT ON ANY ITEM ON A CONSENT
CALENDAR.


[Captioner] 20:12:12
>> Councilmember Jones: OKAY,
THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:12:17
AND WE'LL HEAR FROM THE PUBLIC
SPEAKERS BEFORE WE CONTINUE OUR
CONVERSATION.


[Captioner] 20:12:23
WE'LL HEAR FROM THEM FIRST.
I'D LIKE TO OPEN THE PUBLIC
COMMENT PERIOD.


[Captioner] 20:12:30
>> Ms. Gauthier: MARIE H.
MARIE?
>> Mayor Mei: WELCOME, MARIE.


[Captioner] 20:12:34
>> THANK YOU.
MY NAME IS MARIE HUGHES.
I'M A LONG TIME RESIDENT OF


[Captioner] 20:12:40
FREMONT.
I WAS RATHER DISMAYED TO SEE
THAT MY LIST OF SUGGESTED


[Captioner] 20:12:45
IMPROVEMENTS THAT YOU'RE VOTING
ON TODAY, PROPOSAL TO BOTH NOT
LET THE PUBLIC PULL ITEMS FROM


[Captioner] 20:12:52
THE CONSENT CALENDAR BUT ALSO TO
NOT COMMENT ON THE ITEMS AS THEY
COME UP BUT ALL AT ONCE IN THE


[Captioner] 20:12:58
NAME OF EFFICIENCY.
FIRST I MAIL TO SEE HOW THIS
WILL BE MORE EFFICIENT.


[Captioner] 20:13:03
I DO SEE TO BE VERY CONFUSING
BOTH FOR THE PUBLIC BUT ALSO FOR
THE COUNCILMEMBERS WHO ARE


[Captioner] 20:13:08
TRYING TO UNDERSTAND OUR INPUT.
HOW MANY TIMES HAVE WE HAD
MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC CONFUSED


[Captioner] 20:13:13
ABOUT WHAT ITEM WE'RE ON OR NOT
BEING ABLE TO STAY ON TOPIC?
THIS HAPPENS AT ALMOST EVERY


[Captioner] 20:13:19
MEETING.
IF YOU LIMIT PEOPLE TO COMMENT
ON SEVERAL MOST LIKELY UNRELATED


[Captioner] 20:13:24
AGENDA ITEMS AT ONCE, IT'S GOING
TO GENERATE EVEN MORE CONFUSION
ON THE PARTS OF CITIZENS TRYING


[Captioner] 20:13:30
TO PARTICIPATE IN THEIR
GOVERNMENT.
EVEN LESKO HEERNT PUBLIC


[Captioner] 20:13:34
STATEMENTS, MAKING IT HARD FOR
PEOPLE TO GET THEIR POINTS
ACROSS CLEARLY AND FOR COUNCIL


[Captioner] 20:13:39
REPRESENTATIVES TO UNDERSTAND
WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO SAY.
IF YOU REALLY WANT TO MAKE THE


[Captioner] 20:13:44
MEETINGS MORE EFFICIENT, YOU
COULD CUT DOWN ON THE CEREMONIAL
ITEMS OR AT LEAST TIME-BOX THEM.


[Captioner] 20:13:49
OR YOU COULD JUST GO ON AS YOU
HAVE BEEN.
I GO TO A LOT OF MEETINGS OF ALL


[Captioner] 20:13:54
SORTS, AND OUR CITY COUNCIL
MEETINGS ARE ACTUALLY SOME OF
THE BEST-RUN MEETINGS THAT I


[Captioner] 20:13:57
ATTEND.
THEREFORE, I SAY IF IT'S NOT
BROKEN, WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO


[Captioner] 20:14:02
FIX IT?
AND THIS DOES NOT EVEN GET INTO
REMOVING THE POWER TO PULL ITEMS


[Captioner] 20:14:07
FROM THE CONSTITUENTS.
THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO REASON I
CAN SEE TO DO THIS, AND IT HELPS


[Captioner] 20:14:20
NO ONE.
THANK YOU.
>> Ms. Gauthier: NAREN IMMADI.


[Captioner] 20:14:23
NAREN.
>> GOOD EVENING, EVERYONE, 
AGAIN.


[Captioner] 20:14:30
YEAH, I HAVE CONCERN WITH THAT
SAME POINT THAT WE ARE CURRENTLY
DISCUSSING HERE.


[Captioner] 20:14:39
CHAPTER 3 SECTION 11, SORRY,
REVISION TO THE RULE BOOK.
I DON'T SEE THE REASON WHY


[Captioner] 20:14:46
PUBLIC AREN'T ALLOWED TO HAVE A
VOICE ON THIS ONE.
I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHY WE ARE


[Captioner] 20:14:54
PROPOSING THIS CHANGE TO PROVIDE
CITY COUNCIL EXCLUSIVELY
AUTHORITY TO WITHDRAW ITEMS FROM


[Captioner] 20:14:57
CONSENT CALENDAR.
I THINK WHAT'S THE PROBLEM WITH
THE WAY IT IS NOW?


[Captioner] 20:15:02
I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW THE
RATIONALE BEHIND IT.
I PERSONALLY FEEL BY DOING THIS,


[Captioner] 20:15:10
WE ARE SETTING A BAD PRECEDENCE.
MOST OF THE TIME, AT LEAST I
VAGUELY REMEMBER THERE WERE


[Captioner] 20:15:18
TIMES LIKE WHEN THIS WAS THE
PUBLIC COMMENTS HAVE RAISED
THEIR VOICE IN CASES WHERE THE


[Captioner] 20:15:26
ITEM WAS TAKEN OUT AND DISCUSSED
AT ITS APPROPRIATE AGENDA ITEMS. 
SO IF THIS IS NOT A CONCERN FOR


[Captioner] 20:15:34
ANY REASON AS MARIE MENTIONED,
IF IT IS NOT BROKEN, WHY CAN'T
WE JUST KEEP IT THE WAY IT IS,


[Captioner] 20:15:45
WHICH WOULD NOT MAKE ANY --
PROPOSED CHANGE.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:15:49
>> Ms. Gauthier: THE NEXT
SPEAKER IS ANNIE.
>> YES.


[Captioner] 20:15:57
MY NAME IS ANNIE, AND I AM A 
12-YEAR RESIDENT OF FREMONT.
I ECHO THE CONCERNS OF THE


[Captioner] 20:16:02
PREVIOUS TWO SPEAKERS AND I URGE
THE COUNCIL TO AMEND THE
PROPOSAL BEFORE YOU TODAY,


[Captioner] 20:16:07
SPECIFICALLY THE 
CHAPTER 3 SECTION L1, BECAUSE I
BELIEVE THAT MEMBERS OF THE


[Captioner] 20:16:11
PUBLIC SHOULD RETAIN THEIR RIGHT
TO PULL ITEMS FROM THE CONSENT
AGENDA.


[Captioner] 20:16:17
I NOTICE A WRITTEN PUBLIC
COMMENT FROM JOHN HINDS, I'M
UNSURE IF THEY'RE PLANNING TO


[Captioner] 20:16:22
SPEAK TODAY, BUT THAT CALCULATED
THAT ON AVERAGE DURING THE LAST
10 MEETINGS, THE WHOLE CONSENT


[Captioner] 20:16:27
AGENDA PROCESS TOOK 7.2 MINUTES.
WHILE I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO
HAVE THE TIME TO INDEPENDENTLY


[Captioner] 20:16:33
VERIFY THAT, THAT NUMBER SEEMS
PRETTY REASONABLE AND I WANT TO
THANK JOHN FOR THEIR WORK.


[Captioner] 20:16:40
ADDITIONALLY, THE 7.2 MINUTES ON
AVERAGE FOR THE CONSENT AGENDA
PROCESS TELLS ME THAT OUR


[Captioner] 20:16:46
CURRENT PROCESS WHEREIN BOTH
MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC AND
MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL HAVE AN


[Captioner] 20:16:50
EQUAL STAKE IN DETERMINING WHICH
ITEMS GET VOTED ON SEPARATELY IS
WORKING.


[Captioner] 20:16:54
ON AVERAGE, IT'S EFFICIENT SO IF
THERE CURRENTLY ISN'T AN
EFFICIENCY PROBLEM, WE DON'T


[Captioner] 20:17:00
NEED ANY CHANGES TO FIX A
NON-EXISTENT PROBLEM.
ADDITIONALLY, IT'S VITAL THAT


[Captioner] 20:17:06
THE PUBLIC IS ABLE TO
PARTICIPATE IN GOVERNANCE
PROCESSES OF OUR OWN CITY IN A


[Captioner] 20:17:10
MEANINGFUL WAY SUCH THAT ITEMS
THAT MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC ARE
UNIQUELY INTERESTED IN CAN BE


[Captioner] 20:17:21
VOTED ON SEPARATELY, THUS THE
PUBLIC CAN DETERMINE ALL OF THE
POE SITIONINGS OF ALL OF OUR


[Captioner] 20:17:26
COUNCILMEMBERS WHICH COULD BE
UNIQUE AND DIFFERENT.
THIS WILL DECREASE THE PUBLIC'S


[Captioner] 20:17:32
ABILITY TO ENSURE THAT, ONE, THE
CONSENT AGENDA IS USED FOR WHAT
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE FOR ONLY,


[Captioner] 20:17:35
NAMELY, REALLY ROUTINE BUSINESS
OR INCREDIBLY NON-CONTROVERSIAL
THINGS.


[Captioner] 20:17:41
AND SO IF THE PUBLIC LOSES THIS
RIGHT, THIS COULD CREATE
SITUATIONS WHERE ITEMS GO ON


[Captioner] 20:17:46
CONSENT WHICH MANY MEMBERS OF
THE PUBLIC FEEL SHOULD NOT, AND
IF THE PUBLIC LOSES THEIR


[Captioner] 20:17:52
RECOURSE AND THEIR SIMPLE RIGHT
TO PULL ITEMS FROM THE CONSENT
AGENDA, THEY MAY FEEL


[Captioner] 20:17:58
INCREASINGLY DISENFRANCHISED AND
UNHEARD, ESPECIALLY IF THEY'RE
UNABLE TO PULL AN ITEM TO


[Captioner] 20:18:03
DETERMINE WHERE ALL OF OUR
COUNCILMEMBERS STAND ON IT.
OFTEN YOU GET COMMENTS FROM


[Captioner] 20:18:07
MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC 
COMPLAINING ABOUT LACK OF
TRANSPARENCY OR LACK OF BEING


[Captioner] 20:18:15
HEARD.
I PERSONALLY DON'T THINK THE
PROBLEM IS QUITE AS EXTREME AS


[Captioner] 20:18:20
THESE COMMENTS PURPORT FRANKLY
BUT IT'S TO ENSURE THEY CAN PULL
ITEMS FROM THE CONSENT AGENDA.


[Captioner] 20:18:26
MAINTAINING THE STATUS QUO ON
THIS MATTER IS ONE CURRENTLY AN
EFFICIENT AND SPEEDY PROCESS,


[Captioner] 20:18:32
TWO, A WAY TO ENSURE THE PROPER
USE OF THE CONSENT AGENDA, AND A
WAY TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PUBLIC


[Captioner] 20:18:38
CAN DETERMINE THE POSITIONS OF
ALL OF OUR COUNCILMEMBERS, AND
THREE, A WAY TO MAKE THE PUBLIC


[Captioner] 20:18:42
FEEL HEARD.
THE STATUS QUO WAS WORKING SO I
ECHO THE TWO PREVIOUS SPEAKERS,


[Captioner] 20:18:49
IT'S NOT BROKEN, SO WE DON'T
NEED TO CHANGE IT.
PLEASE AMEND SECTION 3 -- OR


[Captioner] 20:18:52
CHAPTER 3 SECTION L1 BEFORE YOU
VOTE ON THIS PROPOSAL.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:19:04
>> Ms. Gauthier: THE NEXT
SPEAKER IS JOHN HINDS.
>> HELLO, EVERYONE.


[Captioner] 20:19:08
I AM IMPRESSED BY MY FELLOW
FREMONTERS.
AND I'M MAKING ONE MORE COMMENT


[Captioner] 20:19:15
ABOUT THE CONSENT CALENDAR.
THE CONSENT CALENDAR IS FOR
ITEMS THAT ARE 


[Captioner] 20:19:20
NON-CONTROVERSIAL, AND THERE'S
EXACTLY ONE WAY TO KNOW IF
SOMETHING IS NON-CONTROVERSIAL.


[Captioner] 20:19:26
YOU PUT IT OUT THERE AND NO ONE
CONTROVERTS IT.
ANYTHING BEFORE THE MEETING IS


[Captioner] 20:19:32
JUST A GUESS.
TONIGHT'S REVISION WOULD CURTAIL
THE PUBLIC'S RIGHT TO MAKE THAT


[Captioner] 20:19:37
CALL BASED ON A PRELIMINARY
GUESS.
AS IT TURNS OUT, THOSE GUESSES


[Captioner] 20:19:43
HAVE BEEN RIGHT ABOUT THREE
QUARTERS OF THE TIME.
PRETTY GOOD, BUT NOT ENOUGH THAT


[Captioner] 20:19:51
WE SHOULD WANT TO TURN SUCH A
GUESS INTO A KIND OF RULING.
IN THE WRITTEN COMMUNICATIONS


[Captioner] 20:19:57
FOR 7A TONIGHT, YOU CAN SEE THAT
I ACTUALLY PLODDED THROUGH THE
LAST 10 COUNCIL MEETINGS, AS


[Captioner] 20:20:01
ANNIE MENTIONED, TO SEE HOW MUCH
TIME HAD ACTUALLY BEEN SPENT ON
EACH PHASE OF THE CONSENT


[Captioner] 20:20:07
CALENDAR.
THE UPSHOT IS THAT THIS PROPOSED
CHANGE COULD POTENTIALLY,


[Captioner] 20:20:12
POTENTIALLY SAVE ONE OR TWO
MINUTES PER MEETING.
NOT MUCH.


[Captioner] 20:20:20
IN COMPARISON, ITEM 3 IN THE
SAME MEETINGS, WHEN WE READ
PROCLAMATIONS AND GIVE OUT


[Captioner] 20:20:26
AWARDS AND RECOGNITIONS HAS BEEN
TAKING MORE THAN 11 MINUTES PER
MEET, AND THE CONSENT CALENDAR


[Captioner] 20:20:34
IS ACTUAL LEGISLATIVE ACTIVITY.
AND WHATEVER TIME IS SAVED COMES
AT WHAT COST?


[Captioner] 20:20:38
HISTORICALLY, THE CITY HAS
RESPECTED THE PUBLIC'S JUDGMENT
AS TO WHICH ITEMS SHOULD BE 


[Captioner] 20:20:46
PULLED, AND BY AND LARGE, THE
PUBLIC HAVE EXERCISED THAT
JUDGMENT WELL AND RESPONSIBLY.


[Captioner] 20:20:50
I WOULD LIKE FOR THIS SHOW OF
RESPECT TO CONTINUE AND BE
MUTUAL.


[Captioner] 20:21:00
PLEASE KEEP THE OLD RULE FOR
THIS.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:21:06
>> Ms. Gauthier: THE NEXT
SPEAKER IS KELLY.
>> THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:21:18
JUST TO CLARIFY, THE ANSWER TO
THE QUESTION, WHEN YOU GET TOO
DEEP INTO THE LEGALISMS, THEN IT


[Captioner] 20:21:23
OBSCURES WHAT'S REALLY HAPPENING
AND THAT'S BY DESIGN, BECAUSE
WHEN THE WORDS ARE SO


[Captioner] 20:21:27
COMPLICATED THAT NOBODY
UNDERSTANDS, NOBODY CAN
UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING


[Captioner] 20:21:34
AND THAT'S WHAT REALLY IS 
DESIRED TO HAPPEN ON THE PART OF
THE SPEAKER.


[Captioner] 20:21:39
SO WHEN THE QUESTION IS WHAT'S
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE
CONSENT CALENDAR BEFORE -- THE


[Captioner] 20:21:44
NEW WAY AND THE OLD WAY?
WELL, UNDER THE OLD WAY, SURE,
EVERYONE REMEMBERS THAT PEOPLE


[Captioner] 20:21:51
COULD CALL UP AND SAY, I WANT TO
TALK ABOUT -- I WANT TO PULL
ITEM A, B, C, D, E, F, G, AND


[Captioner] 20:21:59
THEN THEY WOULD GET SOME TIME TO
SPEAK TO EACH ONE.
AND THIS WOULD DRAG ON AND ON


[Captioner] 20:22:05
AND ON AND I GUESS IT ANNOYED
THE PEOPLE WHO WRITE THESE RULES
SO MUCH THAT THEY WROTE THE RULE


[Captioner] 20:22:12
TO OUTLAW THAT PRACTICE AND THEY
WOULD GIVE PEOPLE A CERTAIN
AMOUNT OF TIME TO COVER A, B, C,


[Captioner] 20:22:17
D, E, F, G, H, I, ALL IN ONE
SHOT.
THAT'S WHAT THEY WERE DOING BUT


[Captioner] 20:22:21
THEY DIDN'T TELL COUNCILMEMBER
KASSAN SO THAT'S WHY I'M HERE,
TO TELL COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN TO


[Captioner] 20:22:29
JUST MAKE IT CLEAR, CLEAR, WHAT
IS REALLY HAPPENING HERE?
I'M NOT -- AND OTHER PARTS OF


[Captioner] 20:22:35
THIS RULES AND REGULATIONS,
WE'RE SO PROTECTIVE, WE'RE SO
CONCERNED ABOUT THE CITY'S


[Captioner] 20:22:41
REPUTATION AND THE CITY'S LOGO,
IT'S ALL OVER THIS THING ABOUT
THE USE OF THE CITY LOGO, I JUST


[Captioner] 20:22:45
WANT TO THANK THE CITY OF
FREMONT.
MANY YEARS AGO, WHOEVER DESIGNED


[Captioner] 20:22:50
THIS LOGO, IT'S A WONDERFUL 
LOGO, AND WE REALLY APPRECIATE
IT.


[Captioner] 20:22:57
WE WANT -- WE USE IT ALL THE
TIME, ALL THE TIME WITHOUT
NEEDING ANY KIND OF APPROVALS,


[Captioner] 20:23:02
BECAUSE RIGHT THERE ON THE CITY
LOGO IS MISSION PEAK, A PARK
THAT THIS COUNCIL SHUT DOWN


[Captioner] 20:23:06
ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO AND THEN
DENIED HAVING SHUT DOWN ABOUT A
YEAR AGO.


[Captioner] 20:23:15
AND WE CAN -- RIGHT THERE ON THE
LOGO, IT'S A BEAUTIFUL THING
THAT YOU USE THAT PARK AND THAT


[Captioner] 20:23:20
MOUNTAIN RIGHT THERE.
AND IT OPENS UP SO MANY
OPPORTUNITIES FOR DISCUSSION AND


[Captioner] 20:23:31
USE OF YOUR LOGO.
AND THEN FINALLY, ON THIS RULES
AND PROCEDURES, THERE'S THESE


[Captioner] 20:23:36
REFERRALS.
WE'RE SO CAREFUL ABOUT TWO CAN
MAKE REFERRALS, THE PROCESS FOR


[Captioner] 20:23:40
REFERRALS.
WELL, THERE WAS A REFERRAL TO
COME BACK WITH WHAT IS THE


[Captioner] 20:23:45
STATUS OF A LONG TERM LEASE AT
MISSION PEAK, AND THAT WAS AT
THE END OF 2020 AND THEN AT THE


[Captioner] 20:23:51
END OF 2021, EVERY SINGLE MEMBER
OF THIS COUNCIL VOTED
UNANIMOUSLY TO -- I THINK TO


[Captioner] 20:23:56
SHOOT IT DOWN, TO DENY A LONG
TERM LEASE, AND OF COURSE THAT
LEAVES OPEN THE QUESTION OF WHAT


[Captioner] 20:24:00
IS THE STATUS OF A LONG TERM
LEASE AT MISSION PEAK BECAUSE
IT'S STILL OUT THERE, THAT


[Captioner] 20:24:04
QUESTION, THAT REFERRAL, AND
THAT'S BEEN, WHAT, A YEAR AND A
HALF OR TWO YEARS?


[Captioner] 20:24:10
SO WHERE IS THE ACTION ON THESE
REFERRALS?
PLEASE LOOK IT UP.


[Captioner] 20:24:24
IT'S FROM LATE 2020.
THANK YOU.
>> Ms. Gauthier: NEXT SPEAKER IS


[Captioner] 20:24:26
KATHRYN.
>> HI, I'M GOING TO KEEP MY
COMMENTS REALLY SHORT.


[Captioner] 20:24:33
I JUST WANT TO ECHO, SINCE
EVERYBODY HAS ALREADY SAID
EVERYTHING I WANTED TO SAY, I


[Captioner] 20:24:42
WANTED TO ECHO MARIE'S, NAREN'S,
ANNIE'S AND JOHN HINDS' REMARKS.
I THINK THAT THEY PRETTY MUCH


[Captioner] 20:24:45
COVERED EVERYTHING THAT COULD
POSSIBLY BE COVERED IN THEIR
REMARKS.


[Captioner] 20:24:55
AND I ALSO WANT TO THANK JOHN
HINDS FOR ALL OF THE WORK THAT
HE DID IN INVESTIGATING EXACTLY


[Captioner] 20:25:02
HOW MUCH TIME IS USED ON
AVERAGE.
SO THAT'S IT.


[Captioner] 20:25:06
I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT I AGREE
WITH ALL FOUR OF THOSE PEOPLE
AHEAD OF ME.


[Captioner] 20:25:12
THANK YOU.
>> Ms. Gauthier: THAT'S THE LAST
SPEAKER, MADAME MAYOR.


[Captioner] 20:25:16
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
SO I'D LIKE TO BRING THIS BACK
TO OUR COUNCIL FOR CONVERSATION.


[Captioner] 20:25:19
BEFORE WE MAKE THE VOTE, IF
THERE'S ANY COMMENTS AT THIS
TIME.


[Captioner] 20:25:27
I'M CLOSING THE PUBLIC COMMENT
PERIOD TOO.
I SEE COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN.


[Captioner] 20:25:34
>> Councilmember Kassan: THANK
YOU.
I WANTED TO BRING UP THE 


[Captioner] 20:25:39
ISSUE -- AND I'VE BROUGHT THIS
UP BEFORE AND I KNOW I WAS IN
THE MINORITY ON THIS BEFORE SO I


[Captioner] 20:25:46
JUST FEEL THE NEED TO BRING IT
UP AGAIN ONE MORE TIME, WHICH
THE ISSUE OF THESE PROCLAMATIONS


[Captioner] 20:25:51
AND RECOGNITIONS, ALL THE
DIFFERENT NAMES WE HAVE FOR 
THEM, I FEEL SO UNCOMFORTABLE


[Captioner] 20:25:59
THAT THESE THINGS ARE DONE IN
THE NAME OF THE CITY COUNCIL AND
YET THE CITY COUNCIL HAS NO SAY


[Captioner] 20:26:05
OVER THEM.
SOMETIMES, YOU KNOW, WE DON'T
EVEN KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING IN


[Captioner] 20:26:11
OUR NAME.
I UNDERSTAND SOME PROCLAMATIONS
HAVE BEEN PRESENTED RECENTLY


[Captioner] 20:26:15
THAT WE HAVEN'T EVEN BEEN TOLD
ABOUT.
SO I JUST -- I REALLY DON'T


[Captioner] 20:26:20
AGREE WITH THE WAY PROCLAMATIONS
ARE DONE.
I THINK IF IT'S ON BEHALF OF THE


[Captioner] 20:26:25
WHOLE CITY, I THINK IT NEEDS TO
BE SOMETHING THAT THE ENTIRE
COUNCIL OR AT LEAST A MAJORITY


[Captioner] 20:26:32
OF THE COUNCIL AGREES WITH.
THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:26:37
NEXT IS COUNCILMEMBER KENG.
>> Councilmember Keng: THANK
YOU, MADAME MAYOR.


[Captioner] 20:26:45
SO I DO WANT TO COMMENT ON THE
ISSUE THAT SOME OF THE CALLERS
HAD ADDRESSED REGARDING THE


[Captioner] 20:26:51
ABILITY OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC
COMMENTERS TO BE ABLE TO PULL AN
ITEM FROM CONSENT.


[Captioner] 20:26:58
SO I DO AGREE THAT WE SHOULD
KEEP IT AS IT WAS BEFORE, AND
ALLOW THE GENERAL PUBLIC TO BE


[Captioner] 20:27:05
ABLE TO PULL ITEMS FROM CONSENT.
AND I ALSO WANT TO CLARIFY
REGARDING PROCLAMATIONS, SINCE I


[Captioner] 20:27:11
RECEIVED SOME QUESTIONS FROM THE
GENERAL -- MEMBERS OF THE
GENERAL PUBLIC, IF A -- SO IN


[Captioner] 20:27:18
THE CITY OF FREMONT, IF A
PROCLAMATION IS PRESENTED DURING
COUNCIL MEETING, WE HAVE OUR


[Captioner] 20:27:24
MAYOR READ THE PROCLAMATION, SO
I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT IS
ALSO THE SAME CASE IF A


[Captioner] 20:27:28
PROCLAMATION IS PRESENTED
OUTSIDE THE CITY COUNCIL 
MEETING.


[Captioner] 20:27:36
IT'S NOT REALLY CLEAR WHETHER
IT'S THE MAYOR OR -- IT'S
USUALLY THE MAYOR AND THEN THE


[Captioner] 20:27:46
CITY COUNCIL WHO ARE -- WHOEVER
IS THERE PRESENT AT THAT EVENT,
AND IF -- BECAUSE MY VICE 


[Captioner] 20:27:51
MAYOR'S JOB IS TO TAKE THE 
MAYOR'S ROLE WHEN THE MAYOR IS
ABSENT, SO I WANTED TO JUST


[Captioner] 20:27:59
CLARIFY IF IN CASE OF THE 
MAYOR'S ABSENCE, IF THE -- IF IT
IS THE VICE MAYOR'S JOB TO


[Captioner] 20:28:07
PRESENT THE PROCLAMATION.
THANK YOU.
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: THE


[Captioner] 20:28:16
COUNCIL HANDBOOK ITSELF DOES NOT
ADDRESS WHO ISSUES -- WHO
PRESENTS CEREMONIAL DOCUMENTS IF


[Captioner] 20:28:21
THE MAYOR IS UNAVAILABLE.
THERE'S TWO WAYS PROCEDURALLY
THAT THAT COULD OCCUR.


[Captioner] 20:28:28
THE COUNCIL HANDBOOK CLEARLY
DOES MAKE THE MAYOR THE APPROVAL
AUTHORITY REGARDING THE


[Captioner] 20:28:31
CEREMONIAL DOCUMENTS AND
INHERENT TO THAT IS THE
AUTHORITY TO PRESENT THEM.


[Captioner] 20:28:34
AND THE AUTHORITY TO DELEGATE
THE PRESENTATION TO ANOTHER
COUNCILMEMBER.


[Captioner] 20:28:42
SEPARATELY, THE COUNCIL COULD
CREATE ALTERNATIVES, BUT AS IT'S
WRITTEN NOW, THE MAYOR DOES HAVE


[Captioner] 20:28:48
THAT INHERENT AUTHORITY TO
CHOOSE IN HER ABSENCE WHO SHE
DESIRES TO PRESENT A PARTICULAR


[Captioner] 20:28:51
AWARD BASED UPON THE EXISTING
AUTHORITY TO APPROVE THAT AWARD
ITSELF.


[Captioner] 20:29:06
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY.
NEXT IS COUNCILMEMBER COX.
>> Councilmember Cox: CAN YOU


[Captioner] 20:29:08
HEAR ME?
>> Mayor Mei: NO.
THERE.


[Captioner] 20:29:11
NOW YOU'RE --
>> Councilmember Cox: CAN YOU
HEAR ME NOW?


[Captioner] 20:29:15
EXPWHRNCHTS YES.
>> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.
WE'LL GET THE HANG OF THIS.


[Captioner] 20:29:20
I WANTED TO ECHO, I REALLY
APPRECIATE THE CALLERS THAT HAVE
CALLED IN TONIGHT THAT WE SHOULD


[Captioner] 20:29:27
REALLY RE-THINK CHANGING THAT
PARAGRAPH.
I WANTED THAT -- I VISION THIS


[Captioner] 20:29:32
AS A PUBLIC MEETING THAT THE
RESIDENT SHOULD BE ABLE TO VOICE
THAT AND BE ABLE TO PULL ITEMS


[Captioner] 20:29:40
FROM THE AGENDA AS NEEDED AND
VOICE THEIR OPINION ON THE
INDIVIDUAL AGENDA ITEMS.


[Captioner] 20:29:49
THE SECOND PART IS UNDERSTANDING
THE ROLE OF THE VICE MAYOR IN
TERMS OF IF THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO


[Captioner] 20:29:56
PERFORM CERTAIN DUTIES, WOULDN'T
IT MAKE SENSE TO HAVE SOME OF
THOSE OTHER THINGS THAT WOULD BE


[Captioner] 20:30:02
GIVEN TO THE VICE MAYOR  IN THE
EVENT THE MAYOR IS NOT ABLE TO
FULFILL THE OBLIGATIONS, AND I


[Captioner] 20:30:07
WOULD THINK THAT THAT WOULD BE A
TOTAL REPLACEMENT OF THE SAME
RESPONSIBILITIES THAT HAPPEN


[Captioner] 20:30:15
WITH THE MAYOR WOULD TRANSITION
TO THE SAME AS SOMEONE THAT'S
APPOINTED BY A VICE MAYOR BASED


[Captioner] 20:30:20
ON THE PROCEDURES THAT ARE
OUTLINED IN THIS HANDBOOK.
ANOTHER PART IN DEALING WITH THE


[Captioner] 20:30:27
REQUEST WHETHER IT'S
PROCLAMATIONS OR CEREMONIAL
RECOGNITIONS, I'VE GOTTEN A LOT


[Captioner] 20:30:34
OF FEEDBACK FROM CONSTITUENTS
THAT THEY FEEL THAT THREE WEEKS
IS NOT ACCEPTABLE TO THEM.


[Captioner] 20:30:40
THEY FEEL THAT WE SHOULD HAVE
THE TIME SHORTENED THAT IF THEY
NEED SOMETHING FOR AN EVENT OR


[Captioner] 20:30:48
FOR SOME SORT OF RECOGNITION,
THREE WEEKS IS JUST TOO LONG AND
ESPECIALLY IF SOME OF THEM HAVE


[Captioner] 20:30:55
SUBMITTED WRITTEN STATEMENTS OF
THE PROCLAMATION, IT SEEMS LIKE
IT WOULD BE MINOR EDITING ON THE


[Captioner] 20:31:02
PART OF THE STAFF TO BE ABLE TO
GET THAT -- HELP TO GET THAT
TURNED AROUND AND I'M NOT SURE


[Captioner] 20:31:07
WHERE THE THREE WEEKS CAME FROM
BECAUSE THIS IS ALL BEFORE MY
TIME OF JOINING CITY COUNCIL,


[Captioner] 20:31:16
BUT IT JUST SEEMS LIKE IT'S NOT
A GOOD SERVICE FOR OUR 
RESIDENTS, AND WE SHOULD BE ABLE


[Captioner] 20:31:22
TO TURN THOSE THINGS AROUND
PRETTY QUICKLY.
SO THAT'S MY OTHER COMMENT, IS


[Captioner] 20:31:28
IN SECTION -- REQUEST FOR
CEREMONIAL, APPENDIX D, SECTION
1, TO KIND OF QUESTION THAT.


[Captioner] 20:31:34
AND THEN ALSO I HAD MENTIONED
THIS BEFORE IN PREVIOUS CITY
COUNCIL MEETINGS THAT AS THERE'S


[Captioner] 20:31:44
A NOTICE OF REQUEST FOR WHETHER
CEREMONIAL OR PROCLAMATION OR
SOME EVENT THAT REALLY WITH


[Captioner] 20:31:48
THEIR TECHNOLOGY, ALL OF OUR
CITY COUNCILMEMBERS SHOULD BE
ABLE TO GET AN INSTANT MESSAGE


[Captioner] 20:31:53
THAT IT'S BEEN SUBMITTED BY ONE
OF OUR CITY COUNCILMEMBERS OR
SOME OF OUR CONSTITUENTS.


[Captioner] 20:32:01
AND JUST MAKE SURE THERE'S NO
DUPLICATION OF INFORMATION AND
THAT A COUNCILMEMBER PLUS A


[Captioner] 20:32:07
COMMUNITY MEMBER ARE GOING AFTER
THE SAME EVENT THAT WE KNOW IT'S
ALL COVERED WITH THE GREAT


[Captioner] 20:32:12
TECHNOLOGY THAT WE HAVE HERE IN
FREMONT, IT WOULD BE GREAT TO
HAVE THAT ANNOUNCED TO ALL THE


[Captioner] 20:32:18
CITY COUNCILMEMBERS SO IT'S
TRANSPARENT AND WE UNDERSTAND
WHAT'S HAPPENING THERE.


[Captioner] 20:32:27
ANOTHER PART WAS THAT I HAD
MENTIONED THIS AT OUR RETREAT
WAS, YOU KNOW, WE HAVE THE


[Captioner] 20:32:33
SUMMARY OF ALL THE 
PROCLAMATIONS, AND I THINK THAT
IT'S A GREAT IDEA LIKE WE START


[Captioner] 20:32:40
WITH IT OUTLINED, THIS IS WHAT
WE'VE DONE BEFORE THE A OTHER --
WHEN I WAS EVEN AT OHLONE


[Captioner] 20:32:44
COLLEGE AND OTHER ORGANIZATIONS,
WE ALWAYS HAD A LIST OF
PROCLAMATIONS FOR THE WHOLE YEAR


[Captioner] 20:32:50
LISTED OUT, AND THERE ARE SOME
THAT ARE GOING TO COME UP THAT
WILL HIT SOME BIG ANNIVERSARIES


[Captioner] 20:32:55
AND THINGS THAT WE NEED TO
CELEBRATE, THAT IT COULD BE 125
YEARS AND YOU ONLY GET THAT 


[Captioner] 20:33:00
ONCE, BUT THE MAJORITY OF IT,
SAY 95% OF IT, WE KNOW HAPPENS
EVERY MONTH.


[Captioner] 20:33:10
AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT
WITH THIS LIST THAT WAS
SUMMARIZED, THANKS TO EVERYONE


[Captioner] 20:33:17
THAT PARTICIPATED IN BEING ABLE
TO PUT THIS TOGETHER, THAT THIS
WOULD KIND OF BE OUR STANDARD


[Captioner] 20:33:23
PROCLAMATIONS AND RECOGNITIONS
FOR THE YEAR.
BUT ALSO EVEN THOUGH WE DON'T


[Captioner] 20:33:28
MEET IN AUGUST, I FEEL THAT THE
AUGUST -- THE MONTH OF AUGUST
HAS A LOT OF OTHER GREAT


[Captioner] 20:33:34
ORGANIZATIONS THAT SHOULD BE
RECOGNIZED, LIKE THE PAKISTAN
INDEPENDENCE DAY, INDIA


[Captioner] 20:33:38
INDEPENDENCE DAY, AFGHAN
INDEPENDENCE DAY.
WE MISS OUT ON SOME OF THOSE


[Captioner] 20:33:45
WHETHER WE HAVE TO BRING THEM UP
TO THE JANUARY OR SEPTEMBER AND
EVEN THE MUSLIM APPRECIATION


[Captioner] 20:33:49
MONTH, THAT SHOULD ALSO BE
INCORPORATED, BECAUSE THOSE
THINGS ALL HAPPEN IN AUGUST.


[Captioner] 20:33:56
AND WE HAVE -- THERE'S A GAP
THERE THAT EITHER WE MOVE IT UP
OR WE PUT IT ALL IN SEPTEMBER,


[Captioner] 20:34:04
SO I JUST WANTED TO POINT THAT
OUT BECAUSE THAT WAS MISSING
FROM OUR LIST OF PROCLAMATIONS


[Captioner] 20:34:11
AND RECOGNITIONS.
AND I KNOW SOME OF IT WE DID IN
OTHER PARTS AND JUST WANT TO


[Captioner] 20:34:18
MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE CONSISTENT
AND WE HAVE AN AGREED UPON LIST
AND THAT WAY WE COULD KEEP


[Captioner] 20:34:24
THINGS MOVING MORE SMOOTHLY IF
WE HAVE A MAJORITY OF IT COVERED
IN THIS LIST, BUT GRANTED THAT


[Captioner] 20:34:28
THERE ARE SOME OTHER EXCEPTIONS
AND THEY'RE CITING THINGS THAT
ARE ALWAYS HAPPENING IN FREMONT


[Captioner] 20:34:33
THAT WE ALSO WANT TO CELEBRATE
TOO.
BUT ALLOWING THAT ALL OF THIS


[Captioner] 20:34:41
CAN BE A COHESIVE LIST THAT WE
CAN OPERATE AS SUCCESSFUL AS
OTHER -- AS WE ALL WORK TOGETHER


[Captioner] 20:34:46
COLLECTIVELY IN CARRYING OUT
SOME OF THE RECOGNITIONS SO WE
COULD KIND OF SMOOTH IT OUT AND


[Captioner] 20:34:50
MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE IS ON
BOARD ON IT.
AND I THINK THERE'S ONE OR TWO


[Captioner] 20:34:55
OTHER ONES I'M MISSING RIGHT NOW
THAT I CAN'T THINK.
BUT WE'LL KIND OF CIRCLE BACK ON


[Captioner] 20:35:01
THAT BUT I JUST THINK THAT IT'S
A GOOD LIST AND IF WE COULD KIND
OF GET A FINALIZED LIST THAT


[Captioner] 20:35:10
WOULD BE GREAT, AND THEN WE JUST
HAVE THE -- I CALL IT THE 1 TO
5% THAT MAY APPEAR IN THESE MOST


[Captioner] 20:35:15
UNUSUAL CELEBRATIONS AND 
TRIBUTES TO THOSE THAT WORKED
HARD IN OUR COMMUNITY TO


[Captioner] 20:35:21
RECOGNIZE THEM.
AND JUST HOW DO WE GET THAT
STREAMLINED SO IT'S FASTER THAN


[Captioner] 20:35:26
THREE WEEKS, BECAUSE WE HAVE ALL
THIS TECHNOLOGY AND IT DOESN'T
TAKE A LOT, AND A LOT OF


[Captioner] 20:35:35
RESEARCH HAS BEEN DONE AND BEING
ABLE TO JUST CARRY IT OUT IN A
SHORTER TIME FRAME TO BE ABLE TO


[Captioner] 20:35:38
MEET THE NEEDS OF OUR
CONSTITUENTS AND THOSE THAT
WE'RE CELEBRATING THAT WE WANT


[Captioner] 20:35:48
TO SHARE IN THEIR ACHIEVEMENTS
AND IN OUR DIVERSITY, EQUITY AND
INCLUSION PARTS.


[Captioner] 20:35:52
SO I JUST WANTED TO ADD THOSE
COUPLE OF THINGS IN THERE.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:35:55
NEXT IS COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN.
>>
>> Councilmember Kassan: THANK


[Captioner] 20:35:59
YOU.
WE ALSO HAVE SUCH AN INCREDIBLY
DIVERSE CITY, PEOPLE OF SO MANY


[Captioner] 20:36:06
DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS, 
RELIGIONS, COUNTRIES THAT THEY
COME FROM OR THAT THEIR


[Captioner] 20:36:13
PREDECESSORS COME FROM, AND
SOMETIMES I WORRY A LITTLE BIT
THAT WE MAY NOT BE INCLUDING


[Captioner] 20:36:17
EVERYONE.
THERE WAS JUST A HORRIBLE
NATURAL DISASTER IN PAKISTAN.


[Captioner] 20:36:27
WE HAVE SO MANY PAKISTANI --
PEOPLE FROM PAKISTAN OR OF
PAKISTANI DESCENT IN OUR CITY


[Captioner] 20:36:30
AND I WISH WE COULD HAVE SAID
SOMETHING ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED IN
PAKISTAN.


[Captioner] 20:36:35
AND OF COURSE WE HAVE IMMIGRANTS
FROM SO MANY COUNTRIES WHERE
THERE ARE ALL KINDS OF NATURAL


[Captioner] 20:36:41
AND HUMAN-MADE DISASTERS, AND WE
RECOGNIZE SOME AND NOT OTHERS
AND THEN MAYBE SOME RELINLS AND


[Captioner] 20:36:46
NOT OTHERS.
SO THAT JUST REALLY CONCERNS ME,
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO BE


[Captioner] 20:36:51
INADVERTENTLY MAKING PEOPLE FEEL
LIKE THEY DON'T MATTER AS MUCH.
SO THAT'S ANOTHER THING THAT I


[Captioner] 20:36:58
THINK IT'S  VERY IMPORTANT -- IF
WE'RE GOING TO DO ALL THESE
QUESTIONS, IT'S A GOOD QUESTION


[Captioner] 20:37:02
AS JOHN HINDS SAYS, WE SPEND A
LOT OF TIME ON RESOLUTIONS AND
MAYBE WE NEED TO RE-THINK


[Captioner] 20:37:06
WHETHER IT'S EVEN APPROPRIATE TO
DO THEM AT THESE MEETINGS, BUT
IF WE ARE GOING TO DO THEM, I


[Captioner] 20:37:11
THINK IT'S SOMETHING WE ALL NEED
TO BE VERY THOUGHTFUL ABOUT TO
MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT


[Captioner] 20:37:15
INADVERTENTLY EXCLUDING ANYONE
OR MAKING ANYONE FEEL THAT
THEY'RE NOT -- THAT WE DON'T


[Captioner] 20:37:24
CARE AS MUCH ABOUT THEM AS WE

>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:37:34
NEXT IS COUNCILMEMBER SHAO.
>> Councilmember Shao:   THANK YOU, MADAM MAYOR.


[Captioner] 20:37:43
I HEARD A LOT OF FEEDBACK ABOUT STREAMLINING THE COUNCIL  MEETING, CUTTING THE TIME FOR THE CEREMONIAL 

[Captioner] 20:37:47
RESOLUTION AND SAVING TIME FOR PUBLIC FEEDBACK CONSENT CALENDAR.
I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND THAT.


[Captioner] 20:38:01
AND I ALSO WELCOME COUNCILMEMBER COX'S PROPOSAL FOR KEEPING A LIST OF ALL YEAR ROUND REGULAR CEREMONIAL 

[Captioner] 20:38:10
RESOLUTIONS.
SO THAT WE CAN KEEP THE CONSISTENCY.
IF NOT THEN IN THE NAME OF BEING 

[Captioner] 20:38:19
INCLUSIVE, I CAN IMAGINE THAT THAT LIST WILL KEEP GROWING AND GROWING.
AND FOR CERTAIN DISASTERS, OR 

[Captioner] 20:38:31
EMERGENCIES, OR POLITICAL  EVENTS, OR EVEN PASSING AWAY OF QUEEN ELIZABETH II INSTEAD OF THE CEREMONIAL 

[Captioner] 20:38:36
RESOLUTION, THE CITY CAN ISSUE A STATEMENT AND POST IT ON
CITY WEBSITE.


[Captioner] 20:38:46
I THINK THAT CERTAINLY IS ANOTHER ALTERNATIVE. FOR SUCH EVENTS TO JUST SHOW THE POSITION OF THE FREMONT CITY 

[Captioner] 20:38:52
GOVERNMENT.
ON BEHALF OF THE CITY COUNCIL OF COURSE.


[Captioner] 20:39:02
SO I ALSO WORRY THAT YOU KNOW THERE'S SOME FEEDBACK WHERE I DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT'S RUMOR OR NOT, IT'S LIKE, 

[Captioner] 20:39:09
YOU KNOW, CERTAIN ORGANIZATIONS WERE SOLICITED FOR SUCH CEREMONIAL RESOLUTION BASED


[Captioner] 20:39:19
ON THE CONDITION THAT THE RECIPIENT HAS TO GIVE ACKNOWLEDGMENT TO THE AUTHORING CITY COUNCIL MEMBER FOR SUCH 

[Captioner] 20:39:29
A CEREMONIAL  RESOLUTION, CERTAINLY THAT IS NOT WHAT THIS HANDBOOK MEANT TO ALLOW.


[Captioner] 20:39:39
SO I WELCOME THE APPENDIX D FOR ADDRESSING ALL THOSE ISSUES I JUST MENTIONED.


[Captioner] 20:39:52
AND HOPEFULLY, YOU KNOW, WE CAN REALLY KEEP OUR TIME ON THE PART OF THE CEREMONIAL RECOGNITION.


[Captioner] 20:39:56
THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.
I THINK THAT'S THE LAST OF THE COUNCIL 

[Captioner] 20:40:03
COMMENTS AND I'LL MAKE SOME -- COUNCILMEMBER JONES.
I DIDN'T SEE YOU ON THE SPEAKER BUT GO 

[Captioner] 20:40:07
AHEAD COUNCILMEMBER  JONES.
>> Councilmember Jones:   ALL THE BUTTONS ARE WORKING STILL.


[Captioner] 20:40:13
JUST A QUICK CLARIFICATION, THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A RESOLUTION AND A CERTIFICATE OF  RECOGNITION.


[Captioner] 20:40:19
SO RESOLUTIONS ARE DONE HERE IN THE COUNCIL AND CERTIFICATES OF RECOGNITION ARE TYPICALLY DONE IF YOU 

[Captioner] 20:40:25
GO OUT TO AN EENT, THOSE ARE ISSUED BY THE MAYOR AND THOSE ARE PRESENTED BY WHOEVER THE MAYOR


[Captioner] 20:40:34
DESIGNATES, IF THE MAYOR IS NOT AVAILABLE.
I DON'T KNOW THAT WE NEED TO GO IN 

[Captioner] 20:40:43
SOME TYPE OF PRIORITY REGARDING WHO'S THERE AND WHO IS NOT THERE, IF THE MAYOR CHOOSES A PERSON BASED ON THE 

[Captioner] 20:40:47
ORGANIZATION IS IN THAT PARTICULAR COUNCILMEMBER'S
DISTRICT OR THE ORGANIZATION 

[Captioner] 20:40:51
SPECIFICALLY ASKED FOR THAT COUNCILMEMBER, THEN I DON'T REALLY SEE THE ISSUE OF THAT.


[Captioner] 20:41:03
I DO AGREE THAT WE'VE SPENT A LOT OF TIME ON THE RECOVERINGS.
IF YOU LOOK AT THE APPENDIX REQUESTS 

[Captioner] 20:41:10
SHOULD BE MADE BY COMMUNITY MEMBERS.
ALL OF THE RESOLUTIONS SHOULD COME IN FROM COMMUNITY MEMBERS.


[Captioner] 20:41:21
THIS IS NOT AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO CELEBRATE SOMEONE SO THAT WE GET THE RECOGNITION.


[Captioner] 20:41:30
IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE CELEBRATION OF SOMEONE THAT IS WORTHY OF SOME TYPE OF RECOGNITION.


[Captioner] 20:41:39
WE HAVE A LIST OF RESOLUTIONS THAT ARE DONE ON SOME ANNUAL BASIS AND YOU KNOW THAT MAYBE IT WOULD BE EASIER IF WE 

[Captioner] 20:41:44
SAY HERE IS THE LIST, WE'RE GOING TO GIVE A BLANKET APPROVAL OF THE ITEMS ON THIS


[Captioner] 20:41:50
LIST AND ANYTHING THAT COMES UP HAS TO BE THROUGH THE APPROVAL PROCESS, APPROVED BY THE MAYOR AND I DO AGREE 

[Captioner] 20:42:00
WITH THE TIME LINE ON IT AS WELL.
WE HAVE HAD RESOLUTIONS IN THE PAST, THAT HAVE BEEN PEOPLE HAVE SUGGESTED 

[Captioner] 20:42:14
THAT WE DO A RESOLUTION AND AS YOU DIG DEEPER MAYBE INTO THE ORGANIZATION OR THE TYPE OF RESOLUTION, MAYBE THERE'S 

[Captioner] 20:42:19
SOME BAD
HISTORY THERE AND MAYBE WE DON'T WANT TO RECOGNIZE A PARTICULAR GROUP OR A 

[Captioner] 20:42:26
PARTICULAR IN SOME CASES POLITICAL PARTY WHICH WE SHOULDN'T BE DOING TO BEGIN WITH BUT WE HAVE HAD AND WE HAD 

[Captioner] 20:42:31
ONE JUST THIS
YEAR, WHERE IT CAUSED A LOT OF CONTROVERSY IN THE RESOLUTION THAT IS 

[Captioner] 20:42:37
GOING TO BE PUT FORWARD AND HAD TO DO WITH OUR INDIGENOUS TRIBES.
AND SO YOU KNOW WE KIND OF PULLED THAT 

[Captioner] 20:42:42
BACK.
BUT WITHOUT THAT LEAD TIME YOU DON'T HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO INVESTIGATE 

[Captioner] 20:42:50
AND LOOK INTO WHAT'S APPROPRIATE FOR US TO GET INVOLVED IN AND WHAT'S NOT.
OUR ROLE HERE IS TO TAKE CARE OF OUR 

[Captioner] 20:42:55
RESIDENTS.
THAT'S OUR PRIMARY ROLE.
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE ELECTED FOR.


[Captioner] 20:43:05
AND SO TO SPEND A LOT OF TIME AND EFFORT ON THESE RESOLUTIONS, AND MS. GAUTHIER WILL TELL YOU THESE ARE TIME 

[Captioner] 20:43:11
CONSUMING.
THEY ARE VERY TIME CONSUMING.
IT'S NOT JUST I'LL SEND IT IN, WHIP IT 

[Captioner] 20:43:15
OUT AND WE'RE READY TO GO.
SO I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A SUGGESTION AS I SAID.


[Captioner] 20:43:23
WE ADOPT A LIST OF SOME THAT WE ALL AGREE ON, WE HAVE A BLANKET APPROVAL, ANYTHING THAT COMES UP BEYOND THAT 

[Captioner] 20:43:29
THEN IT GETS SUBMITTED AND THINGS THAT WE GO OUT TO THE PUBLIC TO DO ARE CERTIFICATES OF


[Captioner] 20:43:33
RECOGNITION AND ARE DONE AT THE MAYOR'S DISCRETION.
AND IT'S VERY SIMPLE.


[Captioner] 20:43:41
IT'S ON PAGE 1 OF THE HANDBOOK.
SO YOU KNOW THE MAYOR'S THE CEREMONIAL FACE OF THE CITY OR THEIR DESIGNEE.


[Captioner] 20:43:52
SO I THINK IF WE FOLLOW HANDBOOK THINGS DON'T HAVE TO BE SO COMPLICATED OR CONVOLUTED.


[Captioner] 20:43:58
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU, COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN DO YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO ADD?


[Captioner] 20:44:04
>> Councilmember Kassan:   I WANTED TO SECOND THE SUGGESTION THAT WE HAVE A PREAGREED LIST THAT WE DO INCLUDING 

[Captioner] 20:44:11
THE LANGUAGE OF THEM AND THEN ANYTHING ELSE HAS TO BE APPROVED BY COUNCIL.
AND I PERSONALLY WOULD ADD TO THAT, 

[Captioner] 20:44:19
ANY PROCLAMATION REGARDLESS OF WHETHER IT'S READ AT COUNCIL OR BROUGHT TO AN EVENT OUTSIDE OF COUNCIL THAT WE'RE 

[Captioner] 20:44:25
STILL BEING REPRESENTED AT THOSE EVENTS.
AND I FEEL REALLY UNCOMFORTABLE WITH 

[Captioner] 20:44:32
SOME OF THE STRANGE POLITICAL QUID PRO QUO TYPE THINGS THAT SEEM TO BE HAPPENING SOMETIMES AT THESE EVENTS 

[Captioner] 20:44:39
WHERE PROCLAMATIONS ARE MADE.
I THINK IT'S A USE OF COUNCIL GOODWILL IN A WAY THAT ISN'T APPROPRIATE.


[Captioner] 20:44:49
SO I WOULD SECOND WHAT COUNCILMEMBER JONES SAID BUT I WOULD ADD THAT ALL  PROCLAMATIONS, WHAT ARE WE CALLING 

[Captioner] 20:44:56
THEM NOW,  PROCLAMATIONS --
>> CEREMONIAL ITEMS.
>> Councilmember Kassan:   

[Captioner] 20:45:03
PROCLAMATIONS CERTIFICATE OF RECOGNITION AND ALL OF THOSE SHOULD BE APPROVED BY A MAJORITY OF THE COUNCIL 

[Captioner] 20:45:09
UNLESS IT IS ON OUR PREAPPROVED LIST.
>> Mayor Mei:   COUNCILMEMBER JONES.
>> Councilmember Jones:   SORRY JUST 

[Captioner] 20:45:15
AS A FOLLOW-UP.
HOW DIFFICULT WOULD IT BE, TO PRESENT THAT RESOLUTION OR PROCLAMATION DURING 

[Captioner] 20:45:24
A COUNCIL MEETING PRIOR TO IT BEING PRESENTED AT AN ACTUAL EENT, WOULD THAT BE AN OPTION?


[Captioner] 20:45:29
>> Mayor Mei:   SO YOU'RE SAYING TO PRESENT EVERY CERTIFICATE  TO --
>> Councilmember Jones:   TO RECOGNIZE 

[Captioner] 20:45:35
THE RESOLUTION AT A COUNCIL MEETING PRIOR TO IT BEING TAKEN OUT THAT WAY IT HAS THE MAJORITY APPROVAL OF THE 

[Captioner] 20:45:38
COUNCIL.
I WAS JUST THINKING ABOUT HOW WOULD YOU DO THAT.


[Captioner] 20:45:43
BECAUSE THERE ARE THINGS THAT COME UP LAST MINUTE AND THERE ARE THINGS THAT YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO RECOGNIZE 

[Captioner] 20:45:49
PEOPLE OR ORGANIZATIONS FOR.
I STILL THINK BOTTOM LINE THAT DISCRETION SHOULD BE LEFT UP TO THE 

[Captioner] 20:46:00
MAYOR, WHOEVER THAT IS, BUT, YOU KNOW, EITHER YOU VOTE ON THEM AHEAD OF TIME WITH A PRESCRIBED LIST THAT WE HAVE, 

[Captioner] 20:46:06
BECAUSE WE CAN'T
POSSIBLY CONCEIVE OF EVERY SITUATION WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO WANT A 

[Captioner] 20:46:11
PROCLAMATION.
PARTICULARLY AS WE'RE OFF ON THE MONTH OF AUGUST AND THINGS WILL COME UP.


[Captioner] 20:46:17
THERE REALLY ISN'T ANY SUCH THING AS AN AUGUST RECESS.
THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS GOING ON.


[Captioner] 20:46:24
BUT I STILL THINK THE MAYOR SHOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO PRESENT A RESOLUTION WITHOUT COUNCIL APPROVAL, IF IT'S NOT 

[Captioner] 20:46:31
ON THAT LIST IN A CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE IT'S -- IT NEEDS TO BE DONE IN A TIMELY FASHION


[Captioner] 20:46:38
AND AGAIN, THAT'S PAGE 1 OF THE HANDBOOK IS THAT THE MAYOR HAS THE DISCRETION TO ISSUE SUCH PROCLAMATIONS 

[Captioner] 20:46:43
OR RESOLUTIONS.
OR A VARIETY OF TOPICS OR ORGANIZATIONS OR INDIVIDUALS.


[Captioner] 20:46:49
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.
NEXT IS COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN.
>> Councilmember Salwan:   THANK YOU 

[Captioner] 20:46:56
MADAM MAYOR.
YEAH, I LIKE PROCLAMATIONS OR RESOLUTIONS.


[Captioner] 20:47:01
I THINK THEY'RE GOOD FOR THE COMMUNITY BUT SOMETIMES WE GET TOO MUCH SO I THINK WE NEED BALANCE.


[Captioner] 20:47:08
WE NEED SOME BUT WE DON'T NEED EVERY SINGLE ONE.
OUR MAIN JOB IS TO GET STUFF DONE FOR 

[Captioner] 20:47:14
OUR CONSTITUENTS WHICH IS BREAD AND BUTTER STUFF, PUBLIC SAFETY, STREETS AND  ROADS, PARKS, SCHOOLS, THOSE 

[Captioner] 20:47:20
SORTS OF THINGS.
AND I ALSO DON'T WANT TO GET TOO MUCH CAUGHT UP INTO HAVING EVERY SINGLE 

[Captioner] 20:47:25
RESOLUTION, PROCLAMATION CODIFIED AND GET A BLESSING FROM EVERY COUNCILMEMBER.


[Captioner] 20:47:30
I DON'T THINK IT'S A GOOD USE OF OUR TIME.
I THINK WE HAVE A WORKING LIST ALREADY 

[Captioner] 20:47:35
IN THIS ATTACHMENT, I THINK THAT WORKS.
WE DON'T WANT TO HANDICAP THE MAYOR.


[Captioner] 20:47:42
WE WANT THE MAYOR TO BE STRONG AND BE ABLE TO REPRESENT THE COMMUNITY AND HAVE SOME LEEWAY IN THESE ISSUES THAT 

[Captioner] 20:47:48
COME UP WHETHER IT IS THE 100th BIRTHDAY OF A VETERAN OR OTHER ISSUES.


[Captioner] 20:47:54
BUT I REALLY DON'T WANT TO BECOME LIKE SAN FRANCISCO OR BERKELEY OR SAN JOSE WHERE WE'RE SPENDING HOURS AND HOURS 

[Captioner] 20:47:59
OF JUST READING RESOLUTIONS.
I THINK AT SOME POINT THEY LOSE THEIR MEANING.


[Captioner] 20:48:05
REGARDING THE ISSUE ABOUT THE CONSENT ITEM, I REALIZE PROBABLY WHY THIS IS COMING UP.


[Captioner] 20:48:12
AND I DIDN'T TALK TO ANYONE BUT I'M GUESSING THAT LATELY, WE'VE HAD FOLKS PULLING EVERY SINGLE ITEM OFF 

[Captioner] 20:48:18
CONSENT.
AND THAT'S PRIMARILY, THE PURPOSE OF CONSENT IS TO INCREASE EFFICIENCY IN 

[Captioner] 20:48:25
GOVERNMENT TO ALLOW FOR ROUTINE ITEMS WHICH ARE NONCONTROVERSIAL TO MOVE FORWARD WITHOUT EACH ITEM BEING 

[Captioner] 20:48:30
PULLED.
I JUST WANT TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT THE INTENT, TO HELP WITH THAT?


[Captioner] 20:48:37
OR WHAT IS YOUR --
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado:   YES THAT IS THE INTENT, TO RETURN THE GOVERNANCE 

[Captioner] 20:48:45
TO THE COUNCIL AND IT DOESN'T DEPRIVE THE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC THE RIGHT TO SPEAK ON ANY ITEMS ON THE CONSENT 

[Captioner] 20:48:52
CALENDAR.
MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WOULD BE ALLOWED TO SPEAK GENERALLY AND ANY ITEM THAT 

[Captioner] 20:49:00
GETS PULLED, MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WOULD BE ABLE TO SPEAK ABOUT THE ITEM THAT GETS PULLED.


[Captioner] 20:49:05
THE INTENT WAS TO RETURN GOVERNANCE TO THE COUNCIL.
>> Mayor Mei:   JUST TO CLARIFY I KNOW 

[Captioner] 20:49:11
I HAD ASKED THIS QUESTION TOO BECAUSE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WAS SUGGESTED BY STAFF AND MY UNDERSTANDING IS, YOU 

[Captioner] 20:49:16
HAD LOOKED AT OTHER -- THE REASON WHY YOU ARE
PRESENTING IT TO US IS THAT YOU HAD 

[Captioner] 20:49:27
LOOKED AT OTHER CITIES AND THEIR PROCESSES FOR THIS HANDBOOK AND THAT'S HOW YOU CAME UP WITH THIS SUGGESTION.


[Captioner] 20:49:35
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado:   YES, THE COUNCIL GETS TO CHOOSE ITS PROCESSES, THIS WON'T BE UNIQUE AS TO HOW THE, 

[Captioner] 20:49:42
THE COUNCIL HERE GETS TO DECIDE WHAT WORKS  LOCALLY BUT IT IS NOT  UNPRECEDENTED.


[Captioner] 20:49:47

>> Councilmember Salwan:   I THINK WE HAD SOME MEETINGS THAT WAS LIKE 

[Captioner] 20:49:56
PULLING OUT OF A B C D E F G H, THERE WASN'T ANY SIGNIFICANT OTHER THAN THE PERSON WANTED TO COMMENT ON A LOT OF 

[Captioner] 20:50:01
THOSE.
THIS DOES THE MAJORITIES OF THAT IF THE COUNCIL FEELS IT'S NOT APPROPRIATE 

[Captioner] 20:50:08
I'M OPEN TO GOING THE OTHER WAY BUT I THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE EFFICIENCY IN GOVERNMENT AND I DO FEEL LIKE TOO 

[Captioner] 20:50:11
OFTEN PEOPLE
JUST PULL ITEMS JUST TO PULL THE ITEM.


[Captioner] 20:50:18
WHEN WE DO ALLOW AN OPPORTUNITY TO EXPRESS THE COMMENT WE ARE ELECTED OFFICIALS, WE DON'T WANT CONTROVERSIAL 

[Captioner] 20:50:24
ITEMS ON CONSENT CALENDAR.
WE DO WANT TO HAVE A ROBUST HEARING IF THE COMMUNITY WANTS THAT.


[Captioner] 20:50:31
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO AVOID IS FOLKS JUST RANDOMLY JUST PULLING ITEMS JUST SO THEY CAN SPEAK ON EACH ITEM.


[Captioner] 20:50:35
THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.
COUNCILMEMBER COX AND THEN 

[Captioner] 20:50:50
COUNCILMEMBER JONES.
COUNCILMEMBER COX.
NOW.


[Captioner] 20:50:57
>> Councilmember Cox:   OKAY.
I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS IS THAT WE ARE -- OUR MEETINGS ARE GOVERNED BY 

[Captioner] 20:51:04
PARLIAMENTARY PROCEDURE.
AND ROBERT'S RULE OF ORDER.
AND I THINK WE HAVE DONE IN SOME CASES 

[Captioner] 20:51:15
WERE TOPICS THAT WERE PULLED WHEN OFF TOPIC AND THEN STEPPING IN TO BE ABLE TO BE ABLE TO EXERCISE THAT WE GOT TO 

[Captioner] 20:51:21
STAY ON TOPIC TO RUN AN EFFICIENT MEETING.
AND I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS 

[Captioner] 20:51:30
THAT CERTAINLY TO CONTINUE TO BE ABLE TO EXERCISE THAT PART.
AND MANAGING OUR MEETINGS TO KEEP THEM 

[Captioner] 20:51:35
EFFICIENT.
AND ON POINT, THAT WE'RE STAYING ON THINGS THAT WE HAVE PUBLICLY SAID THIS 

[Captioner] 20:51:39
IS WHAT WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT AND THIS IS WHAT IS GOING TO BE CARRIED FORWARD.


[Captioner] 20:51:48
SO I THINK THOSE ARE THINGS THAT WE COULD KIND OF KEEP IN MIND AS THE MAYOR AND OUR CITY MANAGER AND OUR 

[Captioner] 20:51:56
CITY ATTORNEY ARE INVOLVED.
AND GOING FORWARD AND JUST KIND OF THE HELPFUL REMINDERS IN KEEPING THIS 

[Captioner] 20:52:03
THAT.
ANOTHER FARTHER THAT, YOU KNOW, JUST MAKING SURE -- ANOTHER PART THAT YOU 

[Captioner] 20:52:12
KNOW JUST MAKING SURE THAT IN SOME CASES I REMEMBER LAST YEAR WE HAD MORE THAN ONE  PROCLAMATION, WE HAD FIVE.


[Captioner] 20:52:20
AND IN THE EVENT THAT COULD HAVE BEEN SPREAD AROUND AS WE PREPARE OUR AGENDA THAT NO MORE THAN TWO OR THREE ARE AT 

[Captioner] 20:52:25
A CITY -- YOU KNOW TO BE PRESENTED FOR CITY COUNCIL AND I REMEMBER ON A COUPLE OF


[Captioner] 20:52:30
OCCASIONS WE HAD FIVE.
AND THAT'S -- FIVE IS TOO MANY IN ONE CITY COUNCIL MEETING.


[Captioner] 20:52:39
AND I THINK WE NEED TO KIND OF RETHINK THAT AS THE AGENDA IS BEING SET IN ADVANCE THAT WE KIND OF SEE IF WE 

[Captioner] 20:52:44
SPREAD IT OUT THROUGHOUT THE MONTH.
BECAUSE WE DO HAVE THREE MEETINGS MOST OF THE TIME.


[Captioner] 20:52:48
MOST OF THE MONTHS WHEN WE'RE NOT HAVING HOLIDAYS ON THE -- IN THAT MONTH.


[Captioner] 20:52:59
BUT JUST KIND OF KEEPING IN MIND THAT WE GO UP TO ONE TO THREE AT MAX, FOR PROCLAMATION IF WE CAN AROUND THEN 

[Captioner] 20:53:04
SPREADING IT OUT THROUGH REST OF THE MONTH TO ALLOW TIME SO WE CAN REALLY FOCUS ON MORE OF


[Captioner] 20:53:11
THE TOPICS ATHE HAND TO HELP IMPROVE THE LIVES AND THE QUALITY OF LIFE HERE IN FREMONT FOR OUR RESIDENTS.


[Captioner] 20:53:20
SO I JUST WANDED TO ADD THAT.
AND ALSO, IN CLOSING THE LOOP WE HAVE THIS HANDBOOK.


[Captioner] 20:53:32
BUT WHAT IS THE PROCESS WHEN THINGS ARE NOT ALIGNED IN THE HANDBOOK?
SO HOW DO YOU ADDRESS THINGS LIKE 

[Captioner] 20:53:40
STANDARDS OF CONDUCT OR THINGS THAT WE NEED TO APPROPRIATELY TAKE ACTION ON BECAUSE IT WAS SOME SORT OF A CONFLICT 

[Captioner] 20:53:47
IN CARRYING OUT THIS HANDBOOK.
SO WHAT'S THE BEST PART THERE?
BECAUSE THIS IS FINE WITH THE HANDBOOK 

[Captioner] 20:53:58
BUT THERE'S NO WALKING THROUGH, IS THERE ACTIONS TALKED ABOUT ADDRESSED IS THIS SOMETHING THAT COULD GET US 

[Captioner] 20:54:01
INTO TROUBLE WITH OUR GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS THAT WE
HAVE?


[Captioner] 20:54:09
SO THIS IS THE OTHER PART THAT I DON'T SEE IN THIS PART OF THE HANDBOOK OF WHERE IS THE CLOSED LOOP?


[Captioner] 20:54:15
YOU HAVE THE EXERCISING IT, DOING ALL THE THINGS TO BE EFFICIENT.
BUT THEN WHERE IS IT THAT IF SOME 

[Captioner] 20:54:23
THINGS ARE NOT DONE IN THE SPIRIT OF WHAT'S CARRIED OUT IN THIS HANDBOOK HOW DO YOU ADDRESS THAT AND HOW DO YOU 

[Captioner] 20:54:28
TAKE ACTION TO GET FULL RESOLUTION THAT ALL
PARTIES CONCERNED WILL UNDERSTAND WHAT 

[Captioner] 20:54:35
HAPPENED AND WAS THERE REFERENCE OF THAT PARTICULAR ACTION?
SO I DON'T SEE THAT IN THERE.


[Captioner] 20:54:44
OCCUR SHED SOME LIGHT RAFAEL, OUR ATTORNEY, ALVARADO, TO ADDRESS THAT PART?


[Captioner] 20:54:47
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado:   CERTAINLY, THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION COUNCILMEMBER COX.


[Captioner] 20:54:54
ENFORCEMENT OF THE COUNCIL HANDBOOK OCCURS AT THE COUNCIL LEVEL.
THE COUNCIL IS ESSENTIALLY THE 

[Captioner] 20:55:00
ENFORCEMENT BODY OF VIOLATIONS AND ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF THE HANDBOOK ITSELF.


[Captioner] 20:55:06
SO ENFORCEMENT WHAT IT WOULD LOOK LIKE IS MOST LIKELY WHAT IT COULD LOOK LIKE IS A REFERRAL FOR REVIEW BY THE 

[Captioner] 20:55:12
COUNCIL AS A BODY THAT WOULD HAPPEN PUBLICLY.
AND IF THE COUNCIL DECIDES THAT THERE 

[Captioner] 20:55:24
IS A VIOLATION, AND  CHOOSES TO ENGAGE IN  ENFORCEMENT, ONE OF THE OUTCOMES OF VIOLATIONS ARE BASICALLY POLITICAL 

[Captioner] 20:55:30
STATEMENTS IS WHAT IT COMES
DOWN TO.
CENSURE, THAT KIND OF ACTION.


[Captioner] 20:55:36
SO IT'S REALLY THE COUNCIL'S DISCRETION, THE COUNCIL'S BASICALLY THE REVIEWING BODY OF ITS OWN COUNSEL 

[Captioner] 20:55:44
PROCEDURES.
>> Councilmember Cox:   SO THE COUNCIL ON COUNCIL IS WHAT YOU'RE SAYING?


[Captioner] 20:55:50
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado:   THE COUNCIL AS A BOD REVIEWS VIOLATIONS OF THE COUNCIL VIOLATIONS OF ITS OWN CODE.


[Captioner] 20:55:55
>> Councilmember Cox:   AND IS THERE EVER INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION OR ANYTHING TO THAT EFFECT THAT COULD 

[Captioner] 20:56:00
LEAD TO THAT POINT?
OR IS THAT ALL RELYING ON THE COUNCIL?


[Captioner] 20:56:07
BECAUSE I WOULD FEEL THAT THE CITY ATTORNEY WOULD BE THE ONE THAT WOULD HAVE TO STEP IN TO LOOK TO SEE IF ALL 

[Captioner] 20:56:12
LAWS OR DIFFERENT THINGS OF CONFLICT OF INTEREST OR ALL THINGS HAVE BEEN ABIDED BY OR NOT.


[Captioner] 20:56:18
AND SO I WOULD THINK THAT THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE SOME SORT OF CLOSED LOOP PROCESS BECAUSE IT CAN'T NECESSARILY, 

[Captioner] 20:56:24
WE'RE NOT ALL EXPERTS IN THE LAW.
THAT'S WHY WE HAVE YOU.
AND I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND IF 

[Captioner] 20:56:31
THINGS ARE BEING REPORTED, WHAT THINGS DO WE DO TO DRIVE CLOSURE, AND ADDRESS  IT?


[Captioner] 20:56:36
AND TAKE ACTION.
SO I DON'T REALLY HEAR AN ANSWER THAT IS GOING TO HELP US.


[Captioner] 20:56:44
BECAUSE THEN WE COULD ALL BE AT A STANDSTILL AND WHAT DO YOU DO THEN?
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado:   YES, FOR 

[Captioner] 20:56:52
VIOLATIONS OF THE COUNCIL HANDBOOK ITSELF THE CITY ATTORNEY'S AN ADVISOR NOT AN ENFORCEMENT ENTITY.


[Captioner] 20:57:00
AND REALLY IT DOES COME DOWN TO COUNCIL ENFORCEMENT OF ITS OWN RULES AND THE BODY AS A COUNCIL MAJORITY COULD 

[Captioner] 20:57:06
DETERMINE THAT PUNISHMENT IN THE FORM OF CENSURE IS APPROPRIATE BASED UPON THE VIALS.


[Captioner] 20:57:11
BUT THIS IS A POLICY DOCUMENT THAT THE COUNCIL IMPLEMENTS.
IT'S NOT STATE LAW, IT'S NOT A PENAL 

[Captioner] 20:57:20
CODE PROVISION, IT IS NOT A PPC REGULATION, IT IS A VERY SPECIFIC SET OF RULES THAT THE COUNCIL CREATED FOR 

[Captioner] 20:57:24
 ITSELF SO THE ENFORCEMENT BODY IS THE COUNCIL.
>> Councilmember Cox:   I FIND THAT WE 

[Captioner] 20:57:32
NEED TO HAVE AN ESCALATION POINT AND WHERE DOES THE ESCALATION POINT GO?
THAT'S WHERE I'M TRYING TO 

[Captioner] 20:57:34
UNDERSTAND.
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado:   HOW DO YOU GET IT TO THE CITY COUNCIL FOR 

[Captioner] 20:57:37
REVIEW?
>> Councilmember Cox:   NO, WHERE IS THE DECISION MADE IF SOMETHING HAPPENS 

[Captioner] 20:57:50
THAT WE NEED TO REPORT IT OUT AND WHAT THE ACTIONS WOULD BE TO THEN CALL UPON AN INDEPENDENT BODY ORGANIZATION TO


[Captioner] 20:57:57
INVESTIGATE ON OUR BEHALF, A THIRD PARTY THAT WOULD NEED TO REVIEW IT TO REMOVE ALL OF US THERE, YOU KNOW, ANY 

[Captioner] 20:58:02
TYPE OF, YOU KNOW -- I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND IF THINGS ARE FOUND, HOW IS IT


[Captioner] 20:58:07
ADDRESSED?
AND IT DOESN'T STATE IT RIGHT NOW IN THE CURRENT FORM OF THIS HANDBOOK.


[Captioner] 20:58:17
IT IS JUST A POLICY BUT MOST POLICIES ALSO INCLUDE A CLOSED LOOP WHETHER YOU HAVE MEDIATION, WHETHER YOU HAVE 

[Captioner] 20:58:22
INDEPENDENT -- SOME TYPE OF INDEPENDENT REVIEW THAT HAPPENS, OR INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION.


[Captioner] 20:58:28
AND YOU GO THEN TO A THIRD PARTY TO PULL OUT THE INFORMATION, AND THEN BE ABLE TO SETTLE IT.


[Captioner] 20:58:34
SO I JUST DON'T SEE THAT IN THIS POLICY.
IT'S FINE TO HAVE A POLICY, BUT HOW 

[Captioner] 20:58:41
YOU'RE IMPLEMENTING IT IN CLOSING THE LOOP AND HOW TO KEEP THINGS IN FAIR CONDUCT OR WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL 

[Captioner] 20:58:47
THIS, IN OPERATION AND ABIDE BY THE POLICIES, IF THE
CITY COUNCIL CAN EVEN GET TO THAT 

[Captioner] 20:58:53
POINT.
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado:   YES, I UNDERSTAND YOUR CONCERN AND REALLY THE 

[Captioner] 20:58:58
PROCESS FOR  ADDRESSING A POTENTIAL VIOLATION IS REALLY TO REFER IT TO THE CITY COUNCIL AS THE REVIEWING BODY TO 

[Captioner] 20:59:03
MAKE A
DETERMINATION AT THE COUNCIL LEVEL ABOUT WHETHER THE POLICY WAS VIOLATED 

[Captioner] 20:59:08
ITSELF.
I UNDERSTAND THAT MIGHT BE AN  UNSATISFACTORY ANSWER BUT THERE'S NO 

[Captioner] 20:59:16
INDEPENDENT REVIEWING BODY OR OTHER AGENCY THAT WOULD REVIEW WHETHER THE COUNCIL COMPLIED WITH ITS OWN 

[Captioner] 20:59:22
HANDBOOK.
>> Councilmember Cox:   I JUST FIND IT UNSATISFACTORY IN THAT ASPECT AND THAT 

[Captioner] 20:59:29
IS, WHY HAVE A HANDBOOK AT ALL IF YOU DON'T HAVE A DUE PROCESS?
>> Mayor Mei:   COUNCILMEMBER JONES I 

[Captioner] 20:59:35
JUST WANT TO NOTE THE TIME BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE A BREAK FOR OUR  CAPTIONER BUT I'M GOING TO 

[Captioner] 20:59:40
MAKE SOME COMMENTS AFTER YOU.
LJ THANK YOU I'LL BE VERY BRIEF.
NUMBER 1 REGARDING THE COUNCIL 

[Captioner] 20:59:46
HANDBOOK IF YOU GO THROUGH IT IT'S REALLY A MATTER OF COMMON SENSE AND COMMON COURTESY IS REALLY WHAT IT 

[Captioner] 20:59:52
COMES DOWN TO SO PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD.
REGARDING -- GOSH IT'S BEEN SO LONG 

[Captioner] 21:00:01
AGO I FORGET WHAT THE OTHER TOPIC WAS I WAS GOING TO  INITIALLY DISCUSS.
>> Councilmember Kassan:   

[Captioner] 21:00:05
PROCLAMATIONS?
>> Councilmember Jones:   COULD HAVE BEEN PROCLAMATIONS.


[Captioner] 21:00:11
I THINK IT HAD TO DO MORE WITH THE CONSENT CALENDAR.
I'M WILLING TO GO WITH THE COUNCIL 

[Captioner] 21:00:13
MAJORITY ON THAT.
I DO SEE THE PURPOSE OF THE EFFICIENCY.


[Captioner] 21:00:19
WE HAVE HAD FOLKS WHO PULLED A NUMBER OF ITEMS.
I THINK WHAT IT COMES DOWN TO IS IF 

[Captioner] 21:00:24
THAT PERSON IS TALKING ON THAT ITEM THAT'S FINE.
IF THAT PERSON STRAYS OFF OF THAT ITEM 

[Captioner] 21:00:31
AND THEY ARE ADVISED ONCE THAT YOU ARE NO LONGER ON TOPIC OR YOU MUTE THE MICROPHONE OR DO WHATEVER TO CUT THAT 

[Captioner] 21:00:36
COMMENT OFF IF THEY'RE NOT ON TOPIC THEN IT'S NOT
APPROPRIATE FOR THAT PARTICULAR 

[Captioner] 21:00:39
COMMENT PERIOD.
SO THAT'S IT.
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 21:00:45
I WANTED TO ADD A COUPLE OF ITEMS WHICH IS ONE, I AGREE WITH THE PUBLIC THAT IF THERE IS A COUNCIL MAJORITY THAT 

[Captioner] 21:00:50
WANTS TO SUPPORT THE ABILITY TO PULL THE ITEMS THAT I'M SUPPORTIVE OF THAT TO ALLOW


[Captioner] 21:00:55
PEOPLE TO COMMENT.
I DO ECHO SOME OF THE COMMENTS FROM COUNCILMEMBER JONES WHICH IS THAT 

[Captioner] 21:01:01
SOMETIMES WE'VE HAD PEOPLE PULL EVERY SINGLE ITEM AND NOT NECESSARILY HAVE THE COMMENTS PERTAIN TO THE ITEM AT 

[Captioner] 21:01:07
HAND.
AND SO THEREFORE I'M COMFORTABLE IN MAKING THAT DECISION AND DISCRETION.


[Captioner] 21:01:14
AND IT'S A LITTLE EASIER HERE VERSUS ZOOM TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE SOME OF THAT CLOSURE IF WE NEED TO.


[Captioner] 21:01:21
THE SECOND THING I'D LIKE TO ADD IS THAT THE COUNCIL HANDBOOK WE'VE HAD IT IN THE PAST AND IF THERE WAS A 

[Captioner] 21:01:25
DISCUSSION OF SOMETHING THAT WE FELT WAS NOT COMPLIANCE WITH THE HANDBOOK WE HAVE


[Captioner] 21:01:34
BROUGHT FORTH IN THE PAST REFERRALS.
AND THE OPTION IS ALSO TO CENSURE IF THE COUNCIL MAJORITY AGREES.


[Captioner] 21:01:42
SO THERE IS A WAY TO CLOSE THE LOOP, JUST SOMETIMES MAY NOT HAVE ALWAYS BEEN FOLLOWED UP WITH.


[Captioner] 21:01:47
THEN THE OTHER ITEM IS REGARDING CLOSED SESSION.
I WANTED TO CLARIFY AND I THINK I 

[Captioner] 21:01:57
WANTED TO FOLLOW UP ON A LITTLE COMMENT THAT WAS MADE EARLIER BY COUNCILMEMBER SHAO WHICH IS A CLARIFICATION ON THE 

[Captioner] 21:02:02
CLOSED SESSION PROCESS.
WHEN IT COMES TO THESE TWO ITEMS THERE ARE ONLY TWO DIRECT REPORTS FOR THE 

[Captioner] 21:02:07
COUNCIL AND THAT WE ONLY HAVE THE DISCRETION OR THE AUTHORITY FOR HIRING AND REVIEW OF TWO POSITIONS.


[Captioner] 21:02:13
AND THAT'S THE CITY MANAGER AND THE CITY ATTORNEY.
AND THAT IS ALSO DONE I THINK THAT'S 

[Captioner] 21:02:19
IMPORTANT TO CLARIFY IN THE HANDBOOK THAT EACH OF US HAS ONE VOTE AND THAT IS THE COUNCIL MAJORITY THAT HAS TO 

[Captioner] 21:02:25
STAND.
IT'S NOT ANY INDIVIDUAL, AND THIS IS NOT AUTHORITY OF THE MAYOR OR IT HAS 

[Captioner] 21:02:31
TO BE THE COUNCIL MAJORITY.
AND MOST TIMES WE'RE FORTUNATE I GUESS IT'S UNANIMOUS.


[Captioner] 21:02:37
SO I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PUBLIC UNDERSTANDS THAT, AND IT COMES TO THESE CLOSED SESSION VOTES AND 

[Captioner] 21:02:42
PERHAPS WE HAVE DOCUMENT IT THAT IT IS SOMETHING THAT MUCH LIKE HERE, I DON'T HAVE A VETO


[Captioner] 21:02:49
RIGHT.
I DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUPERSEDE ANY OF MY COUNCILMEMBERS, I CAST ONE 

[Captioner] 21:02:57
VOTE THE SAME AS THE OTHERS.
AND IT IS EQUALLY WEIGHTED.
THE ONLY THING THAT IS DIFFERENT IS ON 

[Captioner] 21:03:05
PAGE 1 IS THE CEREMONIAL AND THE ALSO THE REFERRALS FOR APPOINTMENTS.
EVEN WHEN I MAKE THE REFERRALS FOR 

[Captioner] 21:03:10
APPOINTMENTS THERE IS A CHECK AND BALANCE OF WHICH MEANS THE COUNCIL HAS TO VOTE ON  THOSE, IT CAN'T BE DONE 

[Captioner] 21:03:17
WITHOUT THE APPROVAL OF THE COUNCIL.
I WANTED TO SEE IF THAT WAS SOMETHING WE COULD CLARIFY OR ADD.


[Captioner] 21:03:22
OTHER THAN THAT THOSE ARE MY ONLY COMMENTS ON THIS.
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado:   THAT 

[Captioner] 21:03:29
CERTAINLY WOULD BE UP TO THE COUNCIL TO DIRECT STAFF TO ADD CLARIFYING LANGUAGE AND JUST THE KIND OF BEGIN TO 

[Captioner] 21:03:38
RANGEL COUNCIL COMMENTS A BIT .
IT'S GOING TO BE IMPORTANT FOR STAFF TO KNOW WHAT IS REFLECTED IN THE 

[Captioner] 21:03:44
COUNCIL MAJORITY IN ORDER TO RECEIVE DIRECTION AND IMPLEMENT ANY PROPOSED ADDITIONAL AMENDMENTS INTO THE COUNCIL 

[Captioner] 21:03:48
HANDBOOK.
>> Mayor Mei:   SO WOULD ANYONE LIKE TO MAKE A MOTION?


[Captioner] 21:03:53
BECAUSE I CAN MAKE WHAT I'VE HEARD THIS EVENING I CAN MAKE THE COMMENTS AN SUMMARIZE WHAT I'VE HEARD.


[Captioner] 21:04:00
I THINK SO FAR THE COUNCIL MAJORITY WANTS TO MAKE A CHANGE TO ITEM 3 I THINK OF SECTION --


[Captioner] 21:04:09
>> IT IS L, L-7.
>> Mayor Mei:   I THINK IT'S  L-1.
>> Councilmember Cox:   L-1 PAGE 9.


[Captioner] 21:04:14
>> Mayor Mei:   I THINK THERE IS WHAT I'VE HEARD SO FAR THIS EVENING IS THE COUNCIL MAJORITY IS SAYING THEY WOULD 

[Captioner] 21:04:19
LIKE IT TO REMAIN THE SAME AS IT STANDS.
THERE WAS ALSO SOME SUPPORT I HEARD 

[Captioner] 21:04:27
FOR A LIST OF ITEMS IN TERMS OF HAVING THE CALENDAR DATES THAT WERE RECOMMENDED ON AN ANNUAL BASIS.


[Captioner] 21:04:35
I HAD HEARD SOME COMMENTS ABOUT TRYING TO LIMIT TO ONE TO THREE ITEMS.
BUT THAT IS SOMETIMES A CHALLENGE 

[Captioner] 21:04:40
DEPENDING ON THE NUMBER OF ITEMS THAT ARE SUBMITTED AND THE DATES BY WHICH THEY WANT TO BE RECOGNIZED.


[Captioner] 21:04:45
AND SO IF WE CAN AGREE TO THAT, THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE NOT HAD IN THE PAST.


[Captioner] 21:04:53
AND REGARDING THE AUTHORITY OF MAKING THIS, I WILL SAY THAT I'VE BEEN ON THE COUNCIL NOW FOR EIGHT YEARS AND I KNOW 

[Captioner] 21:04:58
FROM MY PREDECESSORS AND THOSE THAT HAVE SAT IN THE SEAT BEFORE ME THAT IT'S BEEN


[Captioner] 21:05:03
SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN AT THE AUTHORITY OF THE MAYOR.
AND I DON'T SEE ANY CHANGE FOR THAT.


[Captioner] 21:05:10
BUT IF THE COUNCIL MAJORITY WANTS THAT, OTHERWISE I'D LIKE TO KEEP IT THE WAY IT HAS BEEN BECAUSE IT'S BEEN AT THE 

[Captioner] 21:05:14
AUTHORITY OF THE MAYOR WHICH IS ONE OF THE DELINEATION IN THE RULES BETWEEN THE MAYOR


[Captioner] 21:05:22
VERSUS THE COUNCIL.
SO I'M TRYING TO THINK IF THERE'S ANYTHING ELSE I'VE MISSED.


[Captioner] 21:05:27
>> Councilmember Cox:   THE THREE WEEKS NEEDS TO BE RECONSIDERED BECAUSE THAT IS SUCH A LONG TIME.


[Captioner] 21:05:32
>> Mayor Mei:   WELL I WOULD ALSO DEFER A LITTLE BIT TO STAFF ON HOW THEY SET THE DATE.


[Captioner] 21:05:38
SO I DON'T WANT TO JUST IMPLY THE DATE WITHOUT CONSENTING WITH STAFF.
>> Councilmember Cox:   IF IT'S 

[Captioner] 21:05:46
ALREADY WRITTEN THAT SHOULD BE A LOT SHORTER THAN THREE WEEKS.
>> IF STAFF DOES NOT HAVE TO DO 

[Captioner] 21:05:55
ADDITIONAL RESEARCH OR HAVE A HUGE DIALOGUE BACK AND FORTH WITH THE REQUESTOR, TO GET INFORMATION, THEN WE 

[Captioner] 21:06:00
CAN USUALLY TURN IT AROUND FEDERATE QUICKLY.
>> Mayor Mei:   SHALL WE SAY TWO WEEKS 

[Captioner] 21:06:06
AS A MORE FAIR OPTION?
WOULD THAT BE -- I WANT TO MAKE SURE IN FULL SUPPORT OF THE STAFF AND 

[Captioner] 21:06:16
WHAT'S A REASONABLE TIME TRAIL.
>> The Clerk:   AND WITH SCHEDULING WE'LL BE -- WE'LL LOOK AT THE 

[Captioner] 21:06:20
CALENDAR, YOU KNOW, AND TRY NOT TO SCHEDULE AS MANY THINKS BUT IF WE COULD HAVE A COUPLE OF WEEKS THAT 

[Captioner] 21:06:26
WOULD BE GREAT.
GETTING A PHONE CALL OR AN E-MAIL AND YOU WANT -- AND SOMEBODY WANTS IT 

[Captioner] 21:06:37
WITHIN A DAY OR TWO, AND WE ARE SO LEAN IN MY OFFICE.
THAT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT.


[Captioner] 21:06:42
WE HAVE DONE IT IN THE PAST BUT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO TURN THINGS AROUND IN A DAY OR TWO.


[Captioner] 21:06:48
AND TRYING TO GET THE MAYOR IN THE OFFICE AT LEAST TO GET IT SIGNED AS WELL AND TRYING TO COORDINATE 

[Captioner] 21:06:53
EVERYBODY'S SCHEDULE.
SO IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO DO THAT.
WE TRY OUR BEST TO TRY THE TURN THINGS 

[Captioner] 21:06:58
AROUND VERY QUICKLY.
>> Councilmember Cox:   YES YOU DO.
>> The Clerk:   BUT WE'RE VERY, VERY 

[Captioner] 21:07:02
LEAN.
>> Mayor Mei:   I APPRECIATE IT, THAT'S WHY I WANTED TO BE RESPECTFUL 

[Captioner] 21:07:08
AND THOUGHTFUL, IF WE HAVE A SCHEDULE OF DATES THAT MAKES IT EASIER.
ALSO IN THE PAST PRACTICE THIS HAS 

[Captioner] 21:07:14
BEEN A VERY UNUSUAL TIME PERIOD.
IN THE PAST WE GENERALLY ATTEND MANY EVENTS IN PERSON AND HONESTLY WHAT 

[Captioner] 21:07:21
I'VE HEARD FROM THE PEOPLE WHO ARE THE RECIPIENTS IT IS OFTEN VERY NICE IF WE ARE ABLE TO SPEND THE MORNING OR THE 

[Captioner] 21:07:27
EVENT WITH
THEM, AND PRESENT IT THERE, SO ALL PEOPLE CAN JOIN IN THE RECOGNITION 

[Captioner] 21:07:32
INSTEAD OF ON THE DAIS.
BECAUSE IN PAST PRACTICE WE HAVE HAD THE INDIVIDUALS JOIN US HERE IN THE 

[Captioner] 21:07:35
MEETING IN PERSON BUT AT THIS TIME THIS IS NOT SOMETHING WE ARE DOING IN PERSON.


[Captioner] 21:07:40
COUNCILMEMBER JONES.
>> Councilmember Jones:   SORRY I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE.


[Captioner] 21:07:48
IN YOUR LONG LIST OF THINGS THAT THE SET DATES WERE INCORPORATED, THAT YOU KNOW WE WOULD JUST DO A BLANKET 

[Captioner] 21:07:52
APPROVAL FOR THIS IS AN ANNUAL RECOGNITION?
>> Mayor Mei:   THERE HAVE BEEN MANY I 

[Captioner] 21:07:59
THINK THAT -- AND I'D HAVE TO DEFER A LITTLE BIT TO OUR STAFF WHO HAS A VAST PORTFOLIO OF ONES THAT WE'VE PRESENTED 

[Captioner] 21:08:05
OVER THE PAST OVER THE YEARS.
>> The Clerk:   I DID START A SPREADSHEET FOR THIS YEAR SO ANY OF 

[Captioner] 21:08:11
THE ONES THAT CAME THROUGH MY OFFICE WE'VE -- WE'RE KEEPING ON A SPREAD SHEET NOW.


[Captioner] 21:08:17
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH, I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT.
SO I THINK THAT WE'VE GOT SOME 

[Captioner] 21:08:23
DIRECTION AND SOME AMENDMENTS.
AND IF WE'RE OKAY WITH THAT, COULD I HAVE A SECOND?


[Captioner] 21:08:30
SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER KENG.
VICE MAYOR KENG.
OKAY CAN I CALL --


[Captioner] 21:08:35
>> The Clerk:   WHO MADE THE MOTION?
>> Mayor Mei:   I MADE THE MOTION.
>> The Clerk:   SORRY ABOUT  THAT.


[Captioner] 21:08:44
>> Mayor Mei:   TRYING TO BE CONCISE BECAUSE WE HAD SO MUCH FEEDBACK THIS EVENING.


[Captioner] 21:08:55

>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado:  , WE CAN COME BACK WITH AN AMENDED HANDBOOK 

[Captioner] 21:09:07
WITH REFLECTS ALL OF THESE CHANGES THAT WAY YOU DON'T HAVE TO MAKE A VOTE ON A HALF CRAFTED COUNCIL RULE BOOK.


[Captioner] 21:09:11
WE CAN COME BACK.
>> Mayor Mei:   I THINK THAT'S GREAT.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.


[Captioner] 21:09:18
I THINK AT THIS TIME THERE ARE NO COUNCIL REFERRALS AND ARE THERE ANY ORAL REPORTS ON MEETINGS OUT FROM THE 

[Captioner] 21:09:26
COUNCIL?
>> Councilmember Jones:   YOU WERE THERE FOR PART OF IT AS WAS 

[Captioner] 21:09:30
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN AND COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN.
BUT THE LEAGUE OF CITIES ANNUAL 

[Captioner] 21:09:36
CONFERENCE AND COUNCILMEMBER KENG OR VICE MAYOR KENG SORRY.
VERY WELL ATTENDED EVENT I THINK 

[Captioner] 21:09:41
EVERYBODY WAS NICE TO BE OUT OF THE LITTLE BOXES AND MEETING EACH OTHER IN PERSON.


[Captioner] 21:09:48
LOTS OF THINGS GOING ON, VERY INFORMATIVE, LOTS OF GOOD SEMINARS GOOD BREAKOUT SESSIONS AND GLAD TO SEE 

[Captioner] 21:09:53
SUCH A LARGE NUMBER FROM THE COUNCIL IN ATTENDANCE.
>> Mayor Mei:   I ALSO NOTED THAT.


[Captioner] 21:09:59
I ALSO WANT TO THANK COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN SHE MADE A PRESENTATION AT THE EVENT.


[Captioner] 21:10:05
