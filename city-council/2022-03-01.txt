19:07:20 >> City Mgr. Shackelford: THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR AND GOOD EVENING, MEMBERS 
19:07:20 OF THE COUNCIL.

19:07:23 IT'S NICE TO SEE EVERYONE.

19:07:24 I'M GETTING FEEDBACK HERE.

19:07:25 EXCUSE ME FOR A MOMENT.

19:07:25 OKAY.

19:07:28 FIRST LET ME MAKE A COUPLE OF ANNOUNCEMENTS, PLEASE.

19:07:30 PLEASE INDULGE ME.

19:07:36 I WANT TO MAKE THE COMMUNITY AWARE THAT AS OF LAST WEEK, WE RELEASED A 
19:07:41 COMMUNITY SURVEY ON THE PASEO PADRE PARKWAY, DRISCOLL TO WASHINGTON 
19:07:42 BOULEVARD STREET DESIGN.

19:07:44 WE'RE LOOKING FOR PUBLIC INPUT.

19:07:49 AS A FOLLOW-UP TO COUNCIL DIRECTION FROM SEPTEMBER OF LAST YEAR, PASEO 
19:07:54 PADRE PARKWAY HAS BEEN MODIFIED WITH NARROWER TRAFFIC LANES FOR SPEED 
19:07:56 MANAGEMENT, AND NEW BASIC BIKE LANES.

19:08:01 SO WE'RE LOOKING FOR INPUT FROM THE COMMUNITY ON OTHER STREET DESIGN 
19:08:07 CHANGES THAT ADDRESS MULTIMODAL SAFETY, EFFICIENT TRAFFIC FLOW, AND COMMUNITY 
19:08:07 LIVABILITY.

19:08:13 SO NOTIFICATIONS ABOUT THE SURVEY HAVE BEEN MAILED TO RESIDENTS AND PROVIDED 
19:08:18 THROUGH THE FREMONT CONNECTION E-NEWSLETTER, AND FOR THOSE WHO DON'T 
19:08:22 RECEIVE THAT, YOU CAN VISIT OUR FREMONT.GOV WEBSITE FOR MORE 
19:08:22 INFORMATION.

19:08:29 THEN I'D ALSO WANT TO MAKE THE COMMUNITY AWARE THAT OUR COMMUNITY 
19:08:36 SERVICES DEPARTMENT HAS PARTNERED WITH BAY AREA COMMUNITY HEALTH AND OFFERING 
19:08:39 COVID-19 TESTING VACCINATION AND COMMUNITY OUTREACH.

19:08:46 WE'VE DONE THAT AT CENTRAL PARK THROUGHOUT 2021, AND WE'VE  SERVED 
19:08:48 THOUSANDS OF MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY.

19:08:53 SO WE'RE CONTINUING THE PARTNERSHIP INTO 2022, AND SO FOR MORE 
19:08:58 INFORMATION, YOU CAN VISIT OUR WEBSITE, AGAIN, FREMONT.GOV FOR THAT.

19:09:08 SO NOW, PLEASE, LET ME -- ALLOW ME TO HAVE THE HONOR OF INTRODUCING OUR NEW 
19:09:12 CITY ATTORNEY, MY COLLEAGUE, RAFAEL ALVARADO.

19:09:14 WELCOME, RAFAEL.

19:09:24 WELL AS A VARIETY OF MEMBERS OF CITY STAFF WHO ARE HERE TONIGHT TO PROVIDE 
19:09:30 ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON STAFF REPORTS OR ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS.

19:09:33 SO WITH THAT, I WILL TURN IT BACK TO YOU, MAYOR MEI.

19:09:43 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:09:49 SO THE NEXT ITEM IS THE CONSENT CALENDAR, AND I WANTED TO LET PEOPLE 
19:09:55 KNOW THAT THESE ARE ITEMS THAT ARE NOT AGENDIZED THIS EVENING, AND THOSE 
19:10:01 STAFF RECOMMENDATION WILL STAND, AND I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IF ANYONE FROM OUR 
19:10:04 -- A MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC WANTS TO PULL A CONSENT ITEM, AND THE COMMENTS 
19:10:06 SHOULD BE PERTAINING TO THAT.

19:10:08 IF THERE IS SOME.

19:10:13 AND THEN THE OTHER ONE IS OUR OWN COUNCIL.

19:10:15 I SEE TWO HANDS RAISED.

19:10:19 CAN WE CHECK TO SEE IF THEY'RE PERTAINING TO THE CONSENT CALENDAR 
19:10:19 ITEMS THIS EVENING?

19:10:26 >> Ms. Gauthier: LEI, ARE YOU SPEAKING ON A CONSENT CALENDAR ITEM?

19:10:28 DO YOU WANT TO PULL SOMETHING FROM THE CONSENT CALENDAR?

19:10:37 >> OH, I'M SORRY, I'M NOT.

19:10:38 PUBLIC SPEAKING.

19:10:39 PUBLIC COMMENTS.

19:10:40 >> Ms. Gauthier: OKAY.

19:10:41 WE'LL COME BACK TO YOU.

19:10:47 >> Ms. Gauthier: OKAY.

19:10:50 PLEASE LOWER THE HANDS IF YOU'RE NOT SPEAKING ON THE -- OR WANTING TO PULL 
19:10:51 FROM THE CONSENT CALENDAR.

19:11:04 ARE YOU WANTING TO PULL AN ITEM FROM THE CONSENT CALENDAR?

19:11:07 >> NO, WE ARE TALKING ABOUT PUBLIC COMMUNICATION.

19:11:08 >> Ms. Gauthier: ALL RIGHT.

19:11:10 THEN PLEASE LOWER YOUR HAND UNTIL THAT TIME.

19:11:10 THANK YOU.

19:11:16 >> Mayor Mei: CALL AND ANNOUNCE AT EACH SECTION.

19:11:18 SEEING NO HANDS RAISED --

19:11:21 >> Ms. Gauthier: COUNCILMEMBER COX AND VICE MAYOR HAVE THEIR HANDS RAISED.

19:11:24 >> Mayor Mei: OKAY.

19:11:27 COULD YOU CALL ON COUNCILMEMBER COX, WHAT ITEM DID YOU WANT TO PULL OR 
19:11:29 COMMENT ON?

19:11:30 >> Councilmember Cox: 2B.

19:11:39 >> Mayor Mei: VICE MAYOR SALWAN?

19:11:40 >> Vice Mayor Salwan: YES, MAYOR.

19:11:46 I'LL BE RECUSING ON 2E SINCE IT'S PART OF THE LARGER WARM SPRINGS PLAN TO BE 
19:11:48 CONSISTENT WITH PREVIOUS DECISIONS I'VE MADE.

19:11:52 >> Mayor Mei: OKAY.

19:11:57 SO CAN WE GET A MOTION TO MOVE THE CONSENT CALENDAR WITH THE EXCLUSION OF 
19:12:04 ITEM 2B, AND THEN NOTING THAT VICE MAYOR IS GOING TO RECUSE FROM 2E, AND 
19:12:08 I THINK WE MENTIONED WE CAN MAKE AN ADDITION IF THERE'S NO HANDS RAISED 
19:12:12 FOR ITEM -- I THINK IT WAS 5B, IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY?

19:12:18 >> Ms. Gauthier: YES.

19:12:22 >> Councilmember Jones: SO MOVED WITH THE NOTIFICATIONS THAT YOU JUST MADE.

19:12:25 INCLUDING 5B.

19:12:33 >> Ms. Gauthier: I JUST WANT TO MAKE NOTE TO THE PUBLIC, 5B IS THE -- SORRY

19:12:42 IF WE HAVE NO SPEAKERS ON  ITEM 5B, THEN WE CAN ADD TO THE CONSENT

19:12:46 >> Mayor Mei: I'M LOOKING.

19:13:34 AND THE RECUSAL FOR VICE MAYOR ON 2E.

19:13:36 THANK YOU.

19:13:42 NEXT THIS EVENING WILL BE CEREMONIAL ITEMS AND WE HAVE A LOT OF THINGS 
19:13:47 WE'RE FORTUNATE TODAY, I WAS HONORED TO LEARN THAT WE ARE FOUR OUT OF FIVE 
19:13:50 YEARS SO FAR THE HAPPIEST CITY IN THE UNITED STATES AND THIS IS ONE OF THE 
19:13:56 REASONS WHY, IS THAT WE CELEBRATE THE INCREDIBLE LEGACY THAT WE HAVE.

19:14:03 THE FIRST WILL BE A RESOLUTION THIS EVENING FOR THE 125TH ANNIVERSARY OF 
19:14:06 THE COUNTRY CLUB OF WASHINGTON TOWNSHIP WOMEN'S CLUB.

19:14:12 AND I'D LIKE TO READ THAT, AND I UNDERSTAND JOINING US THIS EVENING 
19:14:16 WILL BE MICHI YEE.

19:14:18 I'M LOOKING TO SEE IF SHE'S ONLINE.

19:14:19 >> I AM.

19:14:20 >> Mayor Mei: OH, HI!

19:14:21 LOOKING STYLISH AS EVER.

19:14:24 I WOULD LIKE TO JUST READ THAT AND JUST SHARE.

19:14:32  WHEREAS, THE COUNTRY CLUB OF WASHINGTON TOWNSHIP WOMEN’S CLUB 
19:14:35 CELEBRATES ITS 125TH ANNIVERSARY OF BEING ESTABLISHED IN THE CITY OF 
19:14:41 FREMONT FORMERLY KNOWN AS WASHINGTON TOWNSHIP; AND WHEREAS, SINCE 1896, 
19:14:44 THIS ORGANIZATION PLAYED A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN SUPPORTING THE WOMEN’S RIGHT 
19:14:51 TO VOTE THAT LEAD TO WINIFRED BENDEL, WRITING ON WHY FREMONT ON WHY FREMONT 
19:14:54 SHOULD BE AN INCORPORATED CITY AND EVENTUALLY BECOMING THE FIRST WOMAN TO 
19:15:01 BE ELECTED TO FREMONT CITY COUNCIL FROM 1956 TO 1958; AND WHEREAS, THE COUNTRY 
19:15:07 CLUB OF WASHINGTON TOWNSHIP WOMEN’S CLUB WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN THE 
19:15:11 ESTABLISHMENT OF MANY ENDEAVORS INCLUDING WASHINGTON HOSPITAL AND CITY 
19:15:17 OF FREMONT; AND WHEREAS, THIS CLUB IMPROVED EDUCATION BY PROVIDING 
19:15:20 SCHOLARSHIPS, ESTABLISH COUNTY LIBRARIES, FORMED PARENT TEACHER 
19:15:26 ASSOCIATION, AND PASSED THE BOND MEASURE TO ESTABLISH WASHINGTON UNION 
19:15:32 HIGH SCHOOL IN FREMONT. NOW, THEREFORE, FREMONT CITY COUNCIL HONORS AND 
19:15:36 RECOGNIZES THEIR TRAILBLAZING ACHIEVEMENTS AND FOR THEIR COMMUNITY 
19:15:42 SERVICE FOR OVER 125 YEARS TO THE CITY OF FREMONT DURING THE MONTH OF MARCH 
19:15:48 FOR WOMEN’S HISTORY MONTH.AND I UNDERSTAND ACCEPTING THE RESOLUTION 
19:15:52 THIS EVENING WILL BE MICHI YEE.

19:16:01 SO I DON'T KNOW IF WE NEED TO QUICKLY -- I KNOW WE JUST HIT 7:15, I THINK.

19:16:05 MISS CITY CLERK, OR IF ANYONE WANTS TO CLARIFY WITH ME.

19:16:07 >> YOU CAN FINISH THE CURRENT ITEM.

19:16:07 >> Mayor Mei: OKAY.

19:16:08 THANK YOU.

19:16:09 SO MICHI?

19:16:10 >> OH.

19:16:17 WELL, I DIDN'T REALIZE I WAS SUPPOSED TO PREPARE A SHORT, SHORT NOTE, BUT I 
19:16:22 GATHERED TOGETHER A FEW NOTES WHICH I THINK ARE VERY IMPORTANT, AND I THINK 
19:16:28 A TIME OF REMEMBRANCE, PARTICULARLY TO THOSE EARLY PIONEER WOMEN WHOSE NAMES 
19:16:37 GRACE THE STREETS OF WHAT IS NOW FREMONT WASHINGTON TOWNSHIP WAS HERE 
19:16:39 LONG BEFORE FREMONT, 1956.

19:16:46 SOME OF THE NAMES YOU SEE ON THE STREETS ARE ALLEN SHINN, PATTERSON, 
19:16:55 BENDEL, WILLIAMSON, LILA, WIPPEL, WHO WAS APPARENTLY SOME REALTOR IN 
19:16:58 MOUNTAIN VIEW RESPONSIBLE FOR GETTING THE NAVY YARD UP THERE.

19:17:05 BUT SHE WAS VERY -- A VERY INFORMED REALTOR IN THOSE DAYS FOR A WOMAN.

19:17:14 I WANT TO SAY THAT THOSE WOMEN, THE EARLY PIONEER WOMEN, THEY WERE KIND OF 
19:17:18 LIKE KEPT DOWN BY MANY OF THE MEN WHO TOOK CREDIT FOR A LOT OF THINGS THAT 
19:17:21  HAPPENED AROUND.

19:17:25 TOOK THE WOMEN, WORKING WITH TERESA COX, I WANT TO THANK HER AND SHOW MY 
19:17:29 APPRECIATION FOR THE TIME THAT SHE TOOK TO GET THIS ON THE AGENDA BACK IN 
19:17:32 DECEMBER AND TO WORK WITH HER REGARDING THE WORDING.

19:17:37 I WANTED TO MAKE SURE WE DID NOT TAKE CREDIT FOR ANYTHING THAT WAS NOT 
19:17:37 CORRECT.

19:17:44 AND THE WASHINGTON HOSPITAL  BOOK, WHICH IS VERY BIG, IT EVEN MENTIONS 
19:17:47 THE COUNTRY CLUB OF WASHINGTON TOWNSHIP, WHICH I WAS GLAD TO NOTE 
19:17:53 THAT IT WAS A RECORD THAT THEY ACKNOWLEDGE THE PART THAT THEY PLAYED 
19:17:58 IN HELPING TO GET THE PANEL OF DOCTORS THAT THEN BUILT THE HOSPITAL.

19:18:03 ONE OF THE IMPORTANT THINGS THAT I RECOGNIZE, THEY TRIED TO HAVE A BOND 
19:18:10 TO REFURBISH THE OLD HIGH SCHOOL, BUT THE WOMEN DID NOT SUPPORT THAT, AND IN 
19:18:13 TIME THEY GOT THE NEW WASHINGTON HIGH SCHOOL BUILT ON FREMONT BOULEVARD, 
19:18:14 WHICH IT STANDS  TODAY.

19:18:20 ONE OF THE IMPORTANT PARTS, I THINK MIGHT HAVE BEEN  OVERLOOKED, WAS THAT 
19:18:26 IN 1914, THIS LITTLE GROUP OF WOMEN MANAGED TO GET TOGETHER $3,000 TO 
19:18:29 BUILD A CLUBHOUSE ON PARISH AVENUE IN FREMONT.

19:18:38 IN THOSE DAYS, WHAT CLUBS CAN BUILD A CLUBHOUSE?

19:18:41 I SEE NOTHING LIKE THAT  HAPPENING TODAY FOR WOMEN THAT COULD HAVE THAT 
19:18:45 KIND OF AN AMBITION TO BUILD A CLUBHOUSE.

19:18:52 UNFORTUNATELY, NOT BEING ABLE TO CONTINUE THE MAINTENANCE, IT WAS SOLD 
19:18:52 OFF IN 1993.

19:18:58 THE RENT PAID OFF OR THE MORTGAGE PAID OFF IN 1998 FOR AT LEAST, I THINK, 
19:19:00 90,000 -- THE TOTAL SUM WAS $100,000.

19:19:04 WHICH IS NOTHING BY TODAY'S STANDARDS I REALIZE.

19:19:08 BUT MAYBE HAD THEY KEPT IT ANOTHER 30 YEARS, IT MIGHT HAVE GARNERED A LOT 
19:19:10 MORE INCOME.

19:19:15 TODAY WE PROBABLY HAVE LESS THAN 60,000 STILL IN THE BANK.

19:19:21 SINCE THAT TIME, 20 YEARS, 30 YEARS, THEY'VE BEEN VERY FRUGAL IN HOW THEY 
19:19:22 SPENT THEIR MONEY, OF COURSE.

19:19:28 WE WENT TO ST. JAMES CHURCH AND USED THAT FOR QUITE A FEW YEARS, AND THEN 
19:19:34 BECAUSE I HAPPEN TO BE ON THE BOARD OF THE SHINN HOUSE, WE WERE ABLE TO USE 
19:19:36 THE SHINN ARCHIVE ROOM, WHICH WE CONTINUE TO USED TO.

19:19:44 ONE OF THE REASONS HOW THIS RESOLUTION CAME ABOUT IS BECAUSE WE HAVE A MURAL 
19:19:49 WE'D LIKE TO PRESENT TO THE CITY OF FREMONT DONE BY NANCY PRATT FOR THE 
19:19:50 YEAR OF THE WOMAN.

19:19:55 WE FIGURED WINIFRED, ONE OF OUR MORPHERS AND SHAKERS IN THE EARLY DAYS 
19:20:01 WAS A TRIBUTE TO THE POWER OF WOMEN TO OVERCOME -- OVERCOME A LOT OF THINGS.

19:20:07 AND I'D LIKE TO APPRECIATE TERESA COX FOR WORKING WITH ME ON THAT AND TAKING 
19:20:12 IT ALL THE WAY FROM DECEMBER UNTIL TODAY, MARCH 1ST.

19:20:16 WE HAVE MADE HER AN HONORARY MEMBER OF OUR CLUB, SOMEBODY THAT I KNEW 
19:20:24 MENTIONED THAT WHY DON'T I INVITE A TERESA TO BE A MEMBER, AND I SAID WHY 
19:20:26 NOT, IT NEVER OCCURRED TO ME, SO WE ARE DOING JUST THAT.

19:20:31 THE OTHER THING I WANT TO MENTION, LIKE I SAY, WE BUILT THE CLUBHOUSE IN 1914, 
19:20:36 AND WE DEDICATED A PLAQUE IN 2018 WITH A FEW DIGNITARIES OF THE CITY THAT 
19:20:38 WERE AVAILABLE TO BE THERE.

19:20:47 JUST SO CURRENT STATUS NOW, BECAUSE OF COVID, WHEN WE MIGHT HAVE 25, 30 
19:20:49 PEOPLE AT OUR MEETINGS, WE'RE DOWN TO ABOUT 13.

19:20:55 COVID HAS NOT IMPROVED ANY KIND OF PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS, MANY 
19:21:01 ORGANIZATIONS, EVEN CHURCHES, HAVE GONE DOWN QUITE A BIT IN NUMBER, ALL TO 
19:21:03 COVID, AND THE FEAR OF DEATH AND DYING.

19:21:11 AS I LOOK AROUND TODAY, I SEE MANY GREAT PEOPLE WEATHERING THE STORM, AND 
19:21:17 THOSE THAT ARE NOT ABLE TO MAINTAIN DISTANCE OR COVER THEIR FACE WHERE 
19:21:21 THEY SHOULD BE, MANY PEOPLE ARE IGNORANT, MANY PEOPLE DO NOT HAVE THE 
19:21:25 FACILITIES THAT MANY OF US TODAY ENJOY, HEALTH AND HYGIENE.

19:21:26 AND INFORMATION.

19:21:32 AND THAT'S PART OF THE REASONS WHY SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE GONE UNDER.

19:21:37 AND I JUST WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY FOR LISTENING TO OUR STORY, AND LIKE I 
19:21:39 SAID, THIS IS A TREASURE.

19:21:45 THIS IS A TREASURE, A GROUP OF WOMEN THAT HAVE GONE FAR BEYOND WHAT OUR 
19:21:47 COMMON WOMEN TODAY ARE ABLE TO DO.

19:21:53 WOMEN TODAY ARE NOT DOING THAT ACCEPT IN BUSINESSES, THEY'VE GONE VERY, VERY 
19:21:53 FAR.

19:21:55 HOW MANY WOMEN ON CITY COUNCIL NOW?

19:22:00 FOUR OR FIVE, AS COMPARED TO ONE 70 YEARS AGO.

19:22:04 SO I APPLAUD THE CITY OF FREMONT IN GOING FORWARD, AND OF COURSE HAVING 
19:22:10 OUR ASIAN MAYOR, LILY  MEI, WE'RE ALL VERY PROUD OF THE DIVERSITY THAT THE 
19:22:11 CITY OF FREMONT HAS COME TO BE.

19:22:11 THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

19:22:12 THANK YOU.

19:22:14 AGAIN.

19:22:20 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU, MICHI, FOR COMING THIS EVENING, AND THANK YOUR 
19:22:20 FELLOW SISTERS --

19:22:22 >> OH, I WANT TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING.

19:22:23 LET ME SHOW YOU.

19:22:28 IN HONOR OF ANGELINA REYES,  WHO'S ONE OF OUR MEMBERS WHO HEADS UP THE LEAGUE 
19:22:33 OF WOMEN VOTERS HAS ACCESS TO THESE SORTS OF THINGS, AND ABOUT TWO WEEKS 
19:22:36 AGO, SHE SAYS, WHY DON'T WE HAVE A BANNER, SOMETHING LIKE THIS?

19:22:37 I SAYS, WHY NOT?

19:22:42 SO WE SOLD 12 OF THEM, NOT  KNOWING HOW MANY PEOPLE WOULD ATTEND AND BUY, BUT 
19:22:49 THEY HAD HOPED TO ATTEND IN PERSON, AND WE'RE PROUD OF THE ORGANIZATION THAT 
19:22:50 THEY NOW BELONG TO.

19:22:50 THANK YOU AGAIN.

19:22:51 THIS IS US.

19:22:52 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:22:53 THANK YOU.

19:22:59 SO THANK YOU FOR COMING THIS EVENING, MICHI.

19:23:01 I HOPE TO GATHER AGAIN WITH YOU.

19:23:01 >> THANK YOU.

19:23:05 I WAS HAVING A HARD TIME GETTING ON FOR A MINUTE, BUT SUZANNE, THANK YOU VERY 
19:23:05 MUCH.

19:23:06 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:23:10 SO NOW WE WILL RETURN TO OUR REGULARLY SCHEDULED ITEM THAT WE HAVE TO ATTEND 
19:23:11 AT 7:15.

19:23:16 I APOLOGIZE WE'RE RUNNING A LITTLE BIT LATE AND THAT IS OUR PUBLIC HEARING ON 
19:23:19 THE  REDISTRICTING PROCESS.

19:23:26 AND SO WE WILL BEGIN WITH THAT, AND SO THIS IS THE CITY OF FREMONT

19:24:17 CITY IS HOSTING IN THIS PROCESS.

19:24:43 AS FROM THE THIRD PUBLIC HEARING TO NOW, WE WILL BE REVIEWING TWO REVISED 
19:24:49 MAPS PROPOSED BY OUR CONSULTANT, NATIONAL DEMOGRAPHICS CORPORATION, AND 
19:24:54 THEN HAVE SOME PRESENTATION BY OUR CITY ATTORNEY ABOUT THE ORDINANCE ON THE 
19:24:55 AGENDA TONIGHT.

19:25:01 SO WITH THAT, WE'LL TURN IT OVER TO KRISTEN PARKS, WHO WILL GIVE US A 
19:25:04 PRESENTATION ABOUT  TONIGHT'S MAPS FOR REVIEW.

19:25:05 THANK YOU.

19:25:11 >> THANK YOU, AMANDA.

19:25:18 SO AS I SHARE MY SCREEN, I JUST WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT NOT ONLY DID WE HAVE 
19:25:21 TWO REVISED MAPS FROM THE CONSULTANT THAT I HAVE PREPARED AND WILL BE  
19:25:30 SHOWING YOU, WE DID ALSO RECEIVE A HANDSFUL OF ADDITIONAL PUBLIC MAPS, 
19:25:33 AND I WILL SHOW YOU WHERE THOSE ARE AND WE CAN LOOK AT THEM A LITTLE MORE 
19:25:34 CLOSELY AS THE COUNCIL DESIRES.

19:25:39 SO HERE WE ARE NEARING THE END OF THIS PROCESS.

19:25:44 OF COURSE FOR REDISTRICTING, THE LEGAL DEADLINE FOR THE COUNCIL TO ADOPT A 
19:25:49 NEW MAP IS  APRIL 17TH, AND THAT IS TO GIVE THE COUNTY REGISTRAR OF VOTERS 
19:25:56 PLENTY OF TIME TO BE READY FOR THE NOVEMBER 8TH ELECTION AS WE ARE IN AN 
19:25:57 ELECTION YEAR NOW.

19:26:02 SO THIS IS THE FOURTH PUBLIC HEARING.

19:26:06 THE GOAL, IF POSSIBLE, IS FOR THE COUNCIL TO SELECT A PREFERRED MAP THAT 
19:26:14 CAN BE BROUGHT BACK AND INTRODUCED AND HOPEFULLY THAT ADOPTION WILL HAPPEN 
19:26:16 BEFORE THE DEADLINE, AND I'M CONFIDENT THAT IT WILL.

19:26:20 SO A QUICK REVIEW OF THE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS.

19:26:23 WE DO HAVE FEDERAL LAW AND STATE LAW.

19:26:27 WE REFER BACK TO THE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS.

19:26:32 THE FIRST ONE THAT WE LOOK AT FOR EVERY MAP DRAWN IS EQUAL POPULATION, AND WE 
19:26:39 ARE LOOKING FOR TOTAL POPULATION DEVIATION TO BE LESS THAN 10%, AND 
19:26:43 THAT DEVIATION CALCULATED AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE LARGEST 
19:26:46 POPULATION DISTRICT AND THE SMALLEST POPULATION DISTRICT.

19:26:54 WE ALSO COMPLY WITH THE FEDERAL VOTING RIGHTS ACT, AND WE DO NOT DRAW 
19:26:59 DISTRICTS WHERE RACE IS THE PREDOMINANT OR SOLE FACTOR IN THE DRAWING OF 
19:26:59 BOUNDARIES.

19:27:04 UNDER STATE LAW, WE HAVE FOUR RANK ORDERED CRITERIA THAT MUST BE 
19:27:09 CONSIDERED FOR DISTRICTS, AND THEY ARE ORDERED IN ORDER OF IMPORTANCE.

19:27:18 SO FIRST IS GEE GRAPHIC  CONTIGUITY.

19:27:20 SECOND IS MINIMIZE DIVISION OF NEIGHBORHOODS AND COMMUNITIES OF 
19:27:20 INTEREST.

19:27:23 THIS IS WHERE MOST DISCUSSION OCCURS IN MOST CITIES.

19:27:29 THIRD IS TO CREATE EASILY IDENTIFIABLE BOUNDARIES, AND FOURTH IS TO MAINTAIN 
19:27:29  COMPACTNESS.

19:27:33 SO CONSIDERING THE SHAPE OF THE DISTRICT AS NOT BEING A SHAPE THAT IS 
19:27:40 GOING TO BE BYPASSING ONE AREA JUST TO INCLUDE  ANOTHER, UNLESS THERE IS A 
19:27:42 COMMUNITY OF INTEREST OR NEIGHBORHOOD REASON TO DO SO.

19:27:46 THOSE ARE OUR LEGAL  REQUIREMENTS.

19:27:52 AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE EXISTING DISTRICTS' POPULATION, ACCORDING TO 
19:27:58 THE 2020 CENSUS, AND THE 2020 CENSUS COUNT IS WHAT WE ARE REQUIRED TO USE 
19:28:05 TO REDISTRICT THE CITY, YOU SEE THAT THERE IS AN IMBALANCE ACROSS THE SIX 
19:28:09 DISTRICTS THAT VIOLATES THAT FEDERAL EQUAL POPULATION RULE, BECAUSE THE 
19:28:15 TOTAL DEVIATION IS OVER 10%.

19:28:18 JUST AT 10.62%.

19:28:21 SO WHAT THAT ALERTS US TO DO IS TO BRING THE EXISTING DISTRICT INTO 
19:28:26 COMPLIANCE, AND THEN ALSO REVIEW THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE CALIFORNIA FAIR 
19:28:33 MAPS ACT BECAUSE THAT IS A NEW LAW THAT IS IN PLACE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THIS 
19:28:34 REDISTRICTING CYCLE.

19:28:47 THE OTHER THING THAT I'VE NOTED HERE IS IT CAN BE A LITTLE HARD TO SEE ON THIS 
19:28:49 SCREEN, BUT WHEN WE'RE THINKING ABOUT THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT, YOU CAN SEE 
19:28:56 THAT WE LOOK AT CITIZEN VOTING AGE POPULATION, AND CURRENTLY, THE CURRENT 
19:29:02 DISTRICTS, THERE ARE THREE MAJORITY ASIAN-AMERICAN PACIFIC ISLANDER 
19:29:02 DISTRICTS.

19:29:04 SO THOSE ARE DISTRICTS 1, 4 AND 5.

19:29:11 SO ONE THING TO KEEP IN MIND WHEN LOOKING AT PROPOSED CHANGES IS TO TRY 
19:29:19 TO PRESERVE THAT MAJORITY/MINORITY DISTRICTS IN 1, 4 AND 5.

19:29:25 SO THIS IS THE POPULATION BALANCE MAP.

19:29:28 KEEPING IN MIND WHEN WE USE THE TERM POPULATION BALANCE, WE'RE TALKING 
19:29:35 ABOUT A MAP THAT HAS A LEGALLY PERMISSIBLE TOTAL DEVIATION OF UNDER 10%.

19:29:41 SO HERE IS THE CURRENT DISTRICT MAP, AND YOU CAN SEE THE COUNCILMEMBERS 
19:29:43 THAT REPRESENT EACH DISTRICT.

19:29:49 AGAIN, THIS MAP WAS ADOPTED RELATIVELY RECENTLY.

19:29:57 HOWEVER, THE CENSUS IS ONLY DONE EVERY 10 YEARS, AND SO THIS CURRENT MAP 
19:30:01 REPRESENTS CALCULATIONS THAT WERE MADE  USING CENSUS DATA FROM 2010.

19:30:06 SO THIS IS WHY IN 2020, WE ARE REVISITING THESE BOUNDARY LINES, AND 
19:30:11 IT GIVES US AN OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AT DIFFERENT NEIGHBORHOODS AND 
19:30:12 COMMUNITIES OF INTEREST.

19:30:17 WE HAVE HAD A LOT OF DISCUSSION AND FEEDBACK FROM THE PUBLIC ON THE 
19:30:23 BOUNDARY BETWEEN DISTRICTS 2 AND DISTRICT 3 AND THE DIVISION OF 
19:30:24 CENTERVILLE AND GLENMOOR.

19:30:29 SO THOSE ARE SOME THINGS THAT WE'LL BE TALKING MORE ABOUT.

19:30:35 AND OF COURSE THIS IS JUST A SHORTLIST OF SOME OF THE COMMUNITIES THAT WE 
19:30:41 HAVE HEARD FROM THE PUBLIC SHOULD NOT BE DIVIDED BY DISTRICT BOUNDARIES.

19:30:48 AND SO HERE WE ARE WITH THE MAPS.

19:30:51 SO WE HAVE RECEIVED -- AND IT'S MORE THAN 11 NOW -- PUBLIC SUBMISSIONS.

19:30:52 IT'S ACTUALLY 15.

19:30:56 WE HAVE A TOTAL OF 18 MAPS.

19:31:07 NOT ALL OF THESE MAPS ARE  LEGALLY COMPLIANT, SO IN RED YOU'LL SEE WHAT 
19:31:11 SOME OF THE RED FLAGS ARE WITH CERTAIN MAPS, SO OF COURSE WE ARE GOING TO BE 
19:31:16 FOCUSING ON MAPS THAT MEET THE BASIC REQUIREMENTS AND CRITERIA.

19:31:23 BASED ON OUR LAST PUBLIC  HEARING, COUNCIL REQUESTED REVISION TO TWO 
19:31:27 MAPS, PUBLIC 91064 AND NDC GREEN.

19:31:36 I WORKED WITH STAFF TO MAKE REVISIONS TO THESE TWO MAPS, AND I WILL BE GOING 
19:31:39 OVER THOSE A LITTLE MORE CLOSELY, AND THEN YOU'LL SEE THAT THERE ARE FIVE 
19:31:44 NEW PUBLIC MAPS.

19:31:54 TWO OF THEM ARE NOT LEGALLY COMPLIANT, BUT THE REMAINING THREE, 115088 AND 
19:31:59 115099, I BELIEVE BOTH OF THOSE WERE SUBMITTED BY BETTER NORTH FREMONT, AND 
19:32:00 THEN THERE'S AN ADDITIONAL MAP.

19:32:08 SO THERE ARE THREE THAT WE CAN LOOK AT ON THE INTERACTIVE MAP FOR COMPARISON 
19:32:10 AND FOR EXPLORATION.

19:32:19 SO STARTING WITH THE REVISIONS THAT WERE REQUESTED, SO ONE OF THE PUBLIC 
19:32:27 MAPS SUBMITTED, YOU'LL SEE HERE, PUBLIC MAP 91064, AND THE BLACK DASHED LINES 
19:32:31 REPRESENT THE CURRENT DISTRICT BOUNDARIES AS ADOPTED IN 2017.

19:32:40 AND THE SHADED AREAS INDICATE THE PROPOSED NEW DISTRICT BOUNDARIES FROM 
19:32:42 THE AUTHOR OF THIS PUBLIC MAP.

19:32:49 NOW THIS WAS DISCUSSED BY COUNCIL, THERE WERE TWO AREAS HIGHLIGHTED AND 
19:32:50 REQUESTED TO BE REVISED.

19:32:56 THE FIRST WAS THE AREA OF CENTERVILLE, AND THERE WAS DISCUSSION ABOUT 
19:33:05 BRINGING THE DISTRICT 3 BOUNDARY OVER ALL THE WAY TO THORNTON AND CLEANING 
19:33:08 UP THAT SO THAT CENTERVILLE WOULD NOT BE DIVIDED.

19:33:15 AND THEN OF COURSE THERE WAS A DISCUSSION ABOUT TAKING THIS BAY FRONT 
19:33:25 AREA THAT IS IN THIS PROPOSED MAP BEING GIVEN TO THE PINK DISTRICT, DISTRICT 
19:33:27 1, AND GIVING IT BACK TO DISTRICT 5, WHERE IT CURRENTLY IS.

19:33:34 THERE ARE VERY, VERY FEW PEOPLE RESIDING IN THAT AREA, SO THAT IS A 
19:33:41 VERY EASY CHANGE TO MAKE, BUT I DID WANT TO POINT IT OUT.

19:33:47 SO HERE IS THE REVISION THAT WE ENDED UP ON, AND THIS REVISION IS 
19:33:52 POPULATION-BALANCED, AND I ALSO INDICATED WHICH DISTRICTS WOULD BE UP 
19:33:55 FOR ELECTION IN WHICH YEARS.

19:34:02  AS FOLKS ARE LOOKING AT THIS MAP HERE.

19:34:09 I'LL NOTE THAT THERE'S A LOT OF POPULATION IN THE AREAS SOUTH OF 
19:34:14 FREMONT BOULEVARD, SO IT VERY CHALLENGING TO DRAW THESE LINES 
19:34:18 WITHOUT DIVIDING SOME COMMUNITY.

19:34:23 SO THERE'S NOT EVER GOING TO BE THAT HOLY GRAIL MAP THAT DOESN'T DIVIDE ANY 
19:34:23 COMMUNITY.

19:34:29 SO SOMETIMES WE ARE TRADING OFF THE UNIFICATION OF ONE COMMUNITY FOR 
19:34:35 DIVIDING ANOTHER, AND SO THIS IS WHY COUNCIL HAS DIFFICULT DECISIONS TO 
19:34:39 MAKE, AND THAT IS WHY THEY'RE ELECTED TO MAKE THESE DECISIONS, BECAUSE EVERY 
19:34:41 DECISION INVOLVES SOME KIND OF TRADEOFF.

19:34:48 WE CAN LOOK MORE CLOSELY AT THIS MAP, OF COURSE, BUT IT DOES UNIFY GLENMOOR 
19:34:50 AND CENTERVILLE INTO DISTRICT 3.

19:35:01 THAT IS ACHIEVED, AND YOU DO SEE THERE IS AN AREA BETWEEN MOWRY AND STEVENSON 
19:35:09 BOULEVARD WHERE THE BOUNDARY BETWEEN  DISTRICT 3 AND 4 IS NOT NECESSARILY 
19:35:14 INTUITIVE, BUT WE DID THE BEST THAT WE COULD TO BALANCE THE POPULATION 
19:35:15 BETWEEN THE TWO DISTRICTS.

19:35:19 SO THAT'S ONE THING I WANT TO FLAG HERE.

19:35:34 THE OTHER CHANGE THAT WAS I THINK PART OF THE ORIGINAL 91064 IS TAKING THAT 
19:35:40 PORTION OF DISTRICT 6 AT THE TOP OF IT, YOU CAN SEE ADDING IT INTO  DISTRICT 4 
19:35:44 BECAUSE IT IS PART OF THE GOMES NEIGHBORHOOD.

19:35:51 SO WITH THAT, I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND SHOW YOU THE OTHER MAPS THAT WE MADE 
19:35:55 REVISIONS TO, AND THEN WE CAN SWITCH TO THE INTERACTIVE MAP AND ANSWER 
19:35:55 QUESTIONS.

19:36:03 SO NDC GREEN IS ONE OF THE MAPS THAT YOUR CONSULTANT TEAM PREPARED.

19:36:09 AGAIN, THE BLACK DASHED LINES ARE THE EXISTING 2017 DISTRICT BOUNDARIES AND 
19:36:14 THE SHADED AREAS ARE WHAT WAS PROPOSED BY THE GREEN MAP.

19:36:22 AGAIN, THAT SAME AREA OF CENTERVILLE AND GLENMOOR WAS REQUESTED TO BE 
19:36:28 REVISED WITH THE SAME GOAL OF UNIFYING CENTERVILLE AND PARTICULARLY INCLUDING 
19:36:37 THE COMMERCIAL AREA ON BOTH SIDES OF FREMONT BOULEVARD ALL THE WAY OVER TO 
19:36:37 MOWRY.

19:36:43 AND OF COURSE RIGHT NOW, IN THE GREEN MAP THAT YOU SEE ON THE SCREEN, THAT 
19:36:48 LINE BETWEEN DISTRICT 2 AND 3 GOES ALONG CENTRAL AVENUE, AND SO THE 
19:36:53 REQUEST WAS MADE TO REVISE THAT AND PUSH THAT BOUNDARY TO THORNTON.

19:36:59 SO YOU'LL SEE THAT THAT IS WHAT HAS BEEN DONE IN THE REVISED GREEN MAP 
19:37:05 HERE, THAT WE HAVE UNIFIED GLENMOOR AND  CENTERVILLE.

19:37:14 HOWEVER, UNLIKE 91064, THIS MAP UNIFIES GLENMOOR AND CENTERVILLE INTO WHAT IS 
19:37:16 DISTRICT 2.

19:37:26 SO THAT COULD BE A LITTLE BIT CONFUSING FOR SOME FOLKS, BUT I THINK IT'S VERY 
19:37:31 NICE THAT THE COUNCIL HAS DIFFERENT OPTIONS TO CHOOSE FROM, SO THAT IS 
19:37:32 WHAT'S GOING ON IN THIS MAP.

19:37:41 AGAIN, THE SAME LITTLE PIECE OF DISTRICT 6 IS BEING GIVEN TO DISTRICT 
19:37:46 4, AND THOSE ARE THE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES HERE.

19:37:54 AND AGAIN, WITH THIS MAP, WE WERE ABLE TO GET MORE STRAIGHT LINES AND MORE 
19:38:00 INTUITIVE BOUNDARIES IN TERMS OF THE BORDERS FOR DISTRICT 2.

19:38:07 SO WE CAN LOOK AT ALL OF THIS A LITTLE MORE ZOOMED IN ON THE INTERACTIVE 
19:38:07 REVIEW MAP.

19:38:17 AND FOR MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC, THIS IS ON THE REDISTRICTING WEBSITE, AND IT 
19:38:18 IS UNDER THE DRAFT MAPS PAGE.

19:38:30 AND IT ALLOWS TO YOU TURN OFF AND ON THE EXISTING DISTRICT BOUNDARIES AND 
19:38:31 THE PROPOSED  MAPS.

19:38:36 SO WE DO HAVE A NUMBER OF THE PUBLIC MAPS ON HERE.

19:38:41 I KNOW SOME OF THE NONCOMPLIANT PUBLIC MAPS ARE NOT AVAILABLE ON THE 
19:38:42 INTERACTIVE REVIEW MAP.

19:38:45 WE ARE FOCUSING ON THOSE THAT MEET BASIC CRITERIA.

19:38:48 SO WITH THAT, I WILL STOP SHARING.

19:38:53 I WILL HAND IT OVER TO AMANDA TO LET US KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING NEXT.

19:39:00 >> THANK YOU, KRISTEN.

19:39:06 BEFORE WE MOVE FORWARD, THE OTHER RECOMMENDATION ON THE STAFF REPORT 
19:39:12 TONIGHT IS THE ORDINANCE THAT IS BEFORE YOU, AND WE WILL HAVE A QUICK 
19:39:16 PRESENTATION FROM OUR CITY ATTORNEY, RAFAEL ALVARADO, ON THAT.

19:39:44 SO I'M JUST GOING TO SHARE FOR HIM AND HE WILL BE ABLE TO --

19:39:44 >> WONDERFUL.

19:39:45 THANK YOU, AMANDA.

19:39:46 GOOD EVENING, MAYOR AND COUNCIL.

19:39:53 IN ADDITION TO SELECTION OF A MAP, THE STAFF RECOMMENDS INTRODUCTION OF AN 
19:39:54 ORDINANCE AMENDMENT THIS EVENING.

19:40:00 THE PROPOSED ORDINANCE CONTEMPLATES TWO AMENDMENTS TO THE FREMONT MUNICIPAL 
19:40:04 CODE.

19:40:07 THE FIRST IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE ISSUE OF MAPS AND DISTRICTS.

19:40:12 IT PROPOSES TO AMEND SECTION 2.05.130 OF THE MUNICIPAL CODE.

19:40:17 CURRENTLY, THAT PROVISION PROVIDES THAT THE CITY COUNCIL VOTING DISTRICTS ARE 
19:40:22 DESCRIBED IN THE FREMONT MUNICIPAL CODE IN TEXT, IN LANGUAGE.

19:40:24 THAT'S HOW THE BOUNDARIES ARE DEFINED.

19:40:29 AND THE PROPOSAL IS TO REMOVE THIS LANGUAGE FROM THE FREMONT MUNICIPAL 
19:40:35 CODE AND AUTHORIZE DISTRICT BOUNDARIES TO BE ESTABLISHED VIA A MAP ADOPTED BY 
19:40:36 COUNCIL BY RESOLUTION.

19:40:39 AND OF COURSE THAT'S THE PROCESS THAT WE'RE DISCUSSING THIS EVENING.

19:40:43 THAT WOULD TAKE PLACE AT A FUTURE CITY COUNCIL MEETING ONCE THE CITY COUNCIL 
19:40:44 LANDS ON A MAP.

19:40:51 THE SECOND PROPOSED AMENDMENT IS TO SECTION 2.10.110.

19:40:55 AND THIS IS CLEAN-UP LANGUAGE THAT STAFF IS PROPOSING.

19:40:59 THERE'S OUTDATED LANGUAGE IN THE MUNICIPAL CODE THAT REFLECTS THE 
19:41:04 NUMBER OF VOTES REQUIRED TO TAKE ACTION BY THE CITY COUNCIL, BY A FIVE-MEMBER 
19:41:07 CITY COUNCIL, AND AS WE ALL KNOW, THIS NOW IS A SEVEN-MEMBER COUNCIL, AND 
19:41:14 STAFF IS RECOMMENDING AMENDING THIS LANGUAGE TO REFLECT THAT THE CURRENT 
19:41:16 COMPOSITION IS NOW A SEVEN-MEMBER CITY COUNCIL.

19:41:33 THIS NEXT SLIDE JUST SUMMARIZES THE FULL RECOMMENDATION THAT IS INCLUDED 
19:41:36 IN THE STAFF REPORT THIS EVENING, AND THAT IS THAT THE COUNCIL CONDUCT A 
19:41:40 PUBLIC HEARING ON THE MAPS, THIS IS THE FOURTH PUBLIC HEARING.

19:41:45 AND TO IDENTIFY AND SELECT THE FINAL COUNCIL DISTRICT MAP.

19:41:50 IN ADDITION, AS I JUST  MENTIONED, STAFF RECOMMENDS THE INTRODUCTION OF 
19:41:53 AN ORDINANCE AMENDING THOSE TWO CODE SECTIONS FROM THE FREMONT MUNICIPAL 
19:41:58 CODE, AND ACCORDING TO ANY ORDINANCE ADOPTION TO ALSO DIRECT THE CITY CLERK 
19:42:02 TO POST AND PUBLISH BASE THE SUMMARY OF THE ORDINANCE ACCORDING TO LAW.

19:42:06 SO THAT CONCLUDES MY SECTION OF THE REPORT, COUNCIL.

19:42:06 THANK YOU.

19:42:09 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:42:17 AND AT THIS TIME, I'LL TURN IT BACK TO SEE IF THERE ARE ANY CLARIFYING 
19:42:17 QUESTIONS FROM THE COUNCIL.

19:42:32 COUNCILMEMBER JONES.

19:42:33 >> Councilmember Jones: THANK YOU.

19:42:34 SORRY, I COULDN'T FIND THE BUTTON.

19:42:38 KRISTEN, I GUESS MY ONLY QUESTION IS, AND I THINK I MENTIONED THIS AT OUR 
19:42:45 LAST  HEARING, ONE OF THE REQUESTS OF THE GLENMOOR RESIDENTS, IN KEEPING 
19:42:47 THAT NEIGHBORHOOD TOGETHER, IS THE INCLUSION OF WASHINGTON HIGH, WHICH 
19:42:53 WOULD OBVIOUSLY NOT CHANGE THE POPULATION DENSITY, NOBODY LIVES 
19:43:00 THERE, HOPEFULLY, SO IS THAT SOMETHING THAT'S EASILY DONE  OR --

19:43:09 >> SO RIGHT NOW, IN -- LET ME SHARE MY SCREEN SO I CAN SHOW YOU.

19:43:17 SO YOU CAN SEE WASHINGTON HIGH SCHOOL.

19:43:24 YOU CAN SEE CURRENTLY THAT IT IS IN DISTRICT 3.

19:43:44 AND THEN WITH THE REVISED 91064 MAP, IT IS WITH THE CENTERVILLE IN DISTRICT 
19:43:44 3.

19:43:53 IN THE NDC GREEN MAP, IT'S IN DISTRICT 3 BUT IT'S NOT WITH GLENMOOR AND 
19:43:53 CENTERVILLE.

19:44:07 SO THE NDC GREEN MAP IS NOT ACCOMPLISHING THAT, ALTHOUGH THE OTHER 91064 IS.

19:44:10 SO ONE OF THEM ACCOMPLISHES THAT AND NOT THE OTHER.

19:44:18 >> Councilmember Jones: SO I GUESS THE QUESTION WOULD BE, IN THE EVENT THAT 
19:44:24 WE LANDED ON THE NDC GREEN MAP, HOW MUCH OF AN ISSUE WOULD IT BE TO DRAW A 
19:44:28 LINE AROUND THE SCHOOL TO INCLUDE IT WITH THAT MAP?

19:44:34 >> IT SHOULDN'T BE MUCH OF AN ISSUE TO PULL THAT IN.

19:44:37 >> Councilmember Jones: OKAY.

19:44:39 >> IT SHOULDN'T THROW IT OUT OF BALANCE, NO.

19:44:40 >> Councilmember Jones: OKAY.

19:44:41 THANK YOU.

19:44:52 >> OTHER COUNCILMEMBERS,  CLARIFYING QUESTIONS?  OKAY.

19:44:57 SEEING NONE, DO WE HAVE  CLARIFYING QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS RIGHT NOW FROM 
19:44:59 -- LET'S OPEN THE PUBLIC HEARING FOR THIS.

19:45:09 MS. GAUTHIER, ARE YOU SEEING ANY?

19:45:11 I DON'T SEE ANY PUBLIC HANDS.

19:45:16 >> Ms. Gauthier: I DO NOT SEE ANY HANDS RAISED FOR THE PUBLIC HEARING, NO.

19:45:18 SO YOU CAN CLOSE THE PUBLIC HEARING.

19:45:20 >> Mayor Mei: I'M GOING TO CLOSE THE PUBLIC HEARING AND THEN RETURN IT BACK 
19:45:25 TO THE COUNCIL FOR COMMENTS ON PREFERENCE OF MAPS.

19:45:27 I THINK WE NEED TO MAKE THAT DECISION THIS EVENING.

19:45:35 SO I'LL TURN IT BACK TO THE COUNCIL.

19:45:38 I SEE FIRST, COUNCILMEMBER SHAO.

19:45:40 , YOU HAVE YOUR HAND RAISED.

19:45:44 PLEASE.

19:45:46 >> Councilmember Shao: THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR.

19:45:51 I WOULD LIKE TO JUST EXPRESS A FEW CONCERNS ABOUT THE REVISED GREEN MAP.

19:46:00 SIMPLY BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT THE MAP, IT BASICALLY GOES AROUND BASICALLY THE 
19:46:05 CENTER OF THE CITY, AND IT COVERS AT LEAST THREE ATTENDING AREAS.

19:46:17 NAMELY, MISSION SAN JOSÉ HIGH, WASHINGTON, AS WELL AS THE AMERICAN 
19:46:18 HIGH.

19:46:25 SO THAT CERTAINLY IS NOT SOMETHING THAT YOU SEE IN OTHER DISTRICTS.

19:46:35 THE SECOND CONCERN I HAVE IS THAT THAT WOULD ALSO CHANGE THE REPRESENTATION 
19:46:45 OF CURRENT CITY COUNCILMEMBERS, FOR EXAMPLE, COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN WILL BE 
19:46:53 THEN MOVED TO A DIFFERENT DISTRICT FROM THE ONE THAT SHE IS REPRESENTING NOW.

19:47:01 THAT BASICALLY FORMS TWO OF MY CONCERNS FOR THE TIME BEING.

19:47:07 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:47:09 NEXT I SEE COUNCILMEMBER  KASSAN'S HAND RAISED.

19:47:09 WELCOME.

19:47:12 >> THANK YOU.

19:47:18 I THINK BOTH OF THE MAPS ARE VERY GOOD IN A LOT OF WAYS, AT LEAST FROM THE 
19:47:21 PART OF THE CITY THAT I'M MORE FAMILIAR WITH.

19:47:29 I DO PREFER THE 91604 BECAUSE IT IS LESS OF A CHANGE.

19:47:34 IT KEEPS ME IN THE SAME  DISTRICT.

19:47:37 I THINK IT'S NOT AS DRAMATIC A CHANGE.

19:47:40 BUT AGAIN, I THINK BOTH ARE PRETTY GOOD.

19:47:42 I DEFINITELY PREFER 9160 # 4.

19:47:46  91604.

19:47:47 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:47:48 NEXT I HAVE COUNCILMEMBER JONES.

19:47:53 >> Councilmember Jones: THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR.

19:47:58 SO I GUESS I'LL BE THE FIRST TO SAY MY PREFERENCE WOULD BE THE REVISED GREEN 
19:47:58 MAP.

19:48:02 I THINK IT ACCOMPLISHES A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT WE DISCUSSED AT THE LAST 
19:48:09 MEETING, AND THAT IS IT KEEPS THE GLENMOOR AND GLEN MANOR NEIGHBORHOOD 
19:48:12 TOGETHER, IT INCORPORATES ALL OF THE CENTERVILLE BUSINESS DISTRICT ON BOTH 
19:48:16 SIDES OF FREMONT BOULEVARD, INCLUDING OUR AFGHAN COMMUNITY, BUSINESSES THAT 
19:48:17 ARE LOCATING IN THAT AREA.

19:48:25 IT DOES TAKE AWAY A LITTLE BIT FROM THE AMERICAN ATTENDANCE AREA.

19:48:30 I'M NOT SURE WHERE MISSION SAN JOSÉ ATTENDANCE AREA IS ON THIS MAP, BUT IT 
19:48:34 DOES TAKE A LITTLE BIT AWAY FROM THE AMERICAN ATTENDANCE AREA, BUT IT ALSO 
19:48:41 TO ME SEEMS TO BE THE  MORE -- OR I SHOULD SAY THE LEAST AMOUNT OF CHANGE.

19:48:52 I REMEMBER WHEN WE STARTED THIS PROCESS, QUESTIONS ABOUT WHO DISTRICT 
19:48:56 AM I LIVING IN, WHO AM I LOOKING AT, WHO DO I WORK WITH, THAT KIND OF 
19:48:59 THING, I THINK THIS CREATES A MINIMAL CHANGE TO THAT, AND IT'S GOT THE VERY 
19:49:00 CLEAN LINES.

19:49:15 THE CONCERN I HAVE WITH 91 -- I HOPE IT'S 104 OR WHATEVER THE NUMBER IS, IS 
19:49:19 THE FACT IT TAKES A LOT OF CENTERVILLE AND ALSO INCORPORATES ALL OF NILES, 
19:49:23 WHICH IS REALLY NOT FOLLOWING THE CONTIGUOUS PART OF THE STATE 
19:49:26 RECOMMENDATION THAT WE FOLLOW FOR DISTRICTING.

19:49:33 SO AGAIN IN MY MIND, GREEN ACCOMPLISHES ALL OF THE GOALS THAT WE SET OUT TO 
19:49:37 WITH KEEPING THE NEIGHBORHOODS TOGETHER, KEEPING THE BUSINESS 
19:49:39 DISTRICT TOGETHER AND UNIFYING THE DISTRICT AS A WHOLE.

19:49:44 IT ALSO CLEANS UP THAT LINE AT THE CORNER OF FREMONT AND MOWRY, AND YES, 
19:49:52 IT DOES MOVE COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN TO A DIFFERENT DISTRICT, BUT ONLY BY ABOUT 
19:49:52 TWO BLOCKS.

19:49:55 SO THAT WOULD BE MY PREFERENCE IN GOING FORWARD.

19:49:56 THANK YOU.

19:50:08 >> Mayor Mei: NEXT, COUNCILMEMBER KENG.

19:50:09 >> Councilmember Keng: THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR.

19:50:18 SO I DO AGREE WITH COUNCILMEMBER JONES WITH THE GREEN MAP REVISED WITH THE 
19:50:19 CHANGE FROM THE CURRENT DISTRICTS.

19:50:28 I THINK THE GOAL WITH THE PURPOSE OF NOT TRYING TO CHANGE TOO MUCH OF THE 
19:50:37 CURRENT DISTRICT SO THAT PEOPLE WERE ALREADY NOT SURE WHAT DISTRICTS THEY 
19:50:42 WERE IN AND WITH THE COUNCILMEMBER ELECTION ONLY BEING EVERY FOUR YEARS, 
19:50:48 PEOPLE ARE STILL KIND OF FIGURE OUT WHAT DISTRICT THEY'RE IN AND WHEN THEY 
19:50:51 WILL HAVE IT MENTIONED IN THEIR DISTRICT, SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO 
19:50:58 KEEP THE AFGHAN COMMUNITY, THE BUSINESS DISTRICT TOGETHER ALONG FREMONT 
19:51:04 BOULEVARD, SO I THINK THAT GREEN MAP REVISE IS PROBABLY THE BETTER ONE OF 
19:51:04 THE TWO.

19:51:05 THANK YOU.

19:51:11 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:51:13 COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, DID YOU HAVE MORE COMMENTS NOW?

19:51:14 THANK YOU.

19:51:19 >> Councilmember Kassan: YEAH, I'M JUST CONFUSED WHY -- I JUST AM CONFUSED BY 
19:51:23 COUNCILMEMBER JONES AND KENG'S COMMENTS, BECAUSE BOTH OF THESE MAPS 
19:51:26 KEEP CENTERVILLE TOGETHER AND KEEP GLENMOOR TOGETHER.

19:51:32 ABSOLUTELY, I MEAN, THAT WAS THE REALLY IMPORTANT PRIORITY OF MINE AND THEY 
19:51:32 BOTH DO THAT.

19:51:40 I DON'T SEE ANY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO IN THAT REGARD, AND TO SAY THAT 
19:51:48 THE GREEN ONE IS A LESS DRAMATIC CHANGE JUST DOES SEEM STRANGE TO ME BECAUSE 
19:51:50 IT SEEMS LIKE THAT ONE IS THE MORE DRAMATIC CHANGE.

19:51:59 SO I JUST WANTED TO MAYBE GET SOME CLARIFICATION THAT THERE IS NO 
19:52:03 DIFFERENCE IN TERMS OF KEEPING GLENMOOR AND CENTERVILLE TOGETHER.

19:52:08 I THINK THE QUESTION IS WHICH ONE IS THE MORE DRAMATIC CHANGE FOR PEOPLE 
19:52:10 THAT LIVE IN THAT AREA.

19:52:15 AND I FEEL LIKE THE GREEN ONE IS THE MORE DRAMATIC CHANGE.

19:52:35 >> City Mgr. Shackelford:COUNCI LMEMBER JONES' HAND IS UP, MAYBE HE HAS A 
19:52:36 RESPONSE TO THAT.

19:52:36 >> Mayor Mei: SURE.

19:52:42 I'M TRYING TO SEE THAT -- COUNCILMEMBER JONES, DID YOU HAVE -- I CAN SEE 
19:52:46 COUNCILMEMBER COX ALSO HAS HER HAND RAISED, BUT COUNCILMEMBER JONES, DID 
19:52:48 YOU WANT TO CLARIFY ON THAT ONE, SPECIFICALLY TO THE QUESTION?

19:52:54 >> Councilmember Jones: I THINK IT ACCOMPLISHES MORE, AND I RESPECTFULLY 
19:52:56 DISAGREE WITH COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN ABOUT THE DRAMATIC CHANGE.

19:53:03 YOU KNOW, THE NUMBER MAP  INCLUDES ALL OF NILES, WHICH IS REALLY NOT 
19:53:08 CONTIGUOUS TO ANY PART OF CENTERVILLE OR ANYTHING ELSE.

19:53:14 IT'S ACTUALLY QUITE A DISTANCE AWAY, BUT IT ACCOMPLISHES THE BUSINESS 
19:53:20 DISTRICT UNITY AND THE AFGHAN COMMUNITY INCLUSION AND ALSO STRAIGHTENS OUT THE 
19:53:24 LINE ON MOWRY AVENUE AND KEEPS ALL OF THE GLENMOOR NEIGHBORHOOD TOGETHER.

19:53:28 AND AGAIN, I'M REALLY KIND OF PASSING ALONG WHAT I'VE HEARD FROM A NUMBER OF 
19:53:31 RESIDENTS WITHIN THE DISTRICT, AS WELL AS THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY.

19:53:34 AND I THINK THAT ACCOMPLISHES  IT.

19:53:39 IT REALLY -- THE DRA MAY TICK CHANGE IN MY MIND WOULD BE THE FACT THAT THE 
19:53:45 BOUNDARY ACTUALLY USED TO GO TO PASEO PADRE ON THE EASTERN END AND BETWEEN 
19:53:50 FREMONT AND PASSE YOE NOW IS IN DISTRICT 4, AND I CAN ONLY ASSUME 
19:53:53 THAT'S BECAUSE OF THE ADDITIONAL POPULATION PICKED UP AT THE CORNER OF 
19:53:59 FREMONT AND MOWRY, AND DOWN THAT LANE, AS WELL AS PART OF PARKMONT.

19:54:09 SO THERE ARE SOME MINIMAL CHANGES BUT ALL IN ALL, I THINK KEEPING THINGS 
19:54:16 SIMPLE PEOPLE ARE USED TO, AS COUNCILMEMBER KENG SAID, IT TOOK 
19:54:20 PEOPLE A WHILE TO GET USED TO THE IDEA OF WHAT DISTRICT AM I IN, WHO IS IT 
19:54:25 I'M SUPPOSED TO CONTACT FOR I A PEERNS, EVEN THOUGH WE ALL REPRESENT EVERY 
19:54:28 PART OF THE CITY, WE RESPONSIBLE FOR A PARTICULAR DISTRICT AND I THINK 
19:54:33 KEEPING THAT SIMPLE GOING FORWARD IS PROBABLY THE BEST AVENUE.

19:54:40 AGAIN, SEPARATING THE CITY, SEPARATING NILES FROM ITS CONTIGUOUS NEIGHBORS 
19:54:43 AND ALONG MISSION BOULEVARD, AND DIVERSITY, EQUITY AND INCLUSION RATED 
19:54:47 IT INTO CENTERVILLE, IT JUST SEEMS LIKE A BIT AFTER STRETCH AND IT DOESN'T 
19:54:52 FOLLOW WITH A CONTIGUOUS BOUNDARY RECOMMENDATION OR ORDINANCE PUT FORTH 
19:54:53 BY THE STATE.

19:54:53 THANK YOU.

19:54:56 >> Mayor Mei: SURE.

19:54:58 COUNCILMEMBER CROCKS.

19:55:01 COUNCILMEMBER COX.

19:55:10 COUNCILMEMBER COX?

19:55:13 >> Councilmember Cox: SORRY ABOUT THAT.

19:55:20 I WANTED TO THANK THE STAFF FOR THEIR HARD WORK AND LISTENING AND REVISING, 
19:55:31 AND I WANTED TO CLARIFY, WHEN I'M LOOKING AT THE REVISED MAP OF 91064, I 
19:55:42 SEE -- IS BRUCE STREET IN OR OUT IN THE DISTRICT VERSUS YOU NOTED ON THE GREEN 
19:55:50 MAP THAT THERE'S AN OLIVE AVENUE, SO I'M NOT SURE.

19:56:03 >> CAN YOU REPEAT THAT QUESTION BECAUSE I KNOW YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE PDF MAPS.

19:56:05 

19:56:06 >> Councilmember Cox: RIGHT.

19:56:11 >> I'M TRYING TO LABEL THE STREETS TO SOME EXTENT.

19:56:13 >> Councilmember Cox: CORRECT.

19:56:16 >> ARE YOU ON 91064?

19:56:16 >> Councilmember Cox: YES.

19:56:22 I SEE THERE'S THE PUBLIC MAP, THAT IT HAS IT LISTED FIRST, WHEN IT WAS 
19:56:29 PROPOSED BACK IN FEBRUARY, AND THEN NOW, WITH THE REVISED 91064, THEY'RE 
19:56:30 SHOWING AN OLIVE AVENUE.

19:56:34 SO I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND.

19:56:35 >> THAT'S RIGHT HERE.

19:56:40 IF THAT MAKES SENSE.

19:56:46 SO WASHINGTON BOULEVARD  BECOMES -- GOES DOWN HERE,  RIGHT?

19:56:52 SO IT SORT OF THIS, AND THEN, YOU KNOW, IT REALLY PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE BEEN 
19:56:56 LABELED WASHINGTON BOULEVARD AND NOT OLIVE AVE.

19:56:58 SO YES, THAT'S A GOOD CATCH.

19:56:59 >> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.

19:57:05 SO IT'S OLIVE BOULEVARD -- I MEAN IT'S WASHINGTON BOULEVARD THAT SHOULD BE 
19:57:05 LISTED --

19:57:07 >> THAT SHOULD BE LABELED RIGHT THERE.

19:57:07 YEAH.

19:57:08 >> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.

19:57:09 I WAS GETTING CONFUSED.

19:57:14 I'M LIKE, OLIVE -- IT DIDN'T RING A BELL, BUT NOW I KNOW WHY.

19:57:16 >> GOOD CATCH.

19:57:17 >> Councilmember Cox: THANK YOU.

19:57:19 >> THIS BOUNDARY RIGHT HERE THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

19:57:21 KOCH COX GOT IT.

19:57:25 

19:57:26 >> Councilmember Cox: GOT IT.

19:57:28 CAN YOU MAKE IT JUST A LITTLE BIT BIGGER?

19:57:28 OKAY.

19:57:29 GOT IT.

19:57:37 OKAY.

19:57:43 AND THEN I WAS LOOKING AT THE GREEN MAP.

19:57:52 AND IF YOU CAN JUST SHOW THE BOUNDARIES RIGHT AROUND THERE.

19:57:58 JUST TRYING TO KEEP IRVINGTON TOGETHER AS WE --

19:57:59 >> I'LL ZOOM OUT A LITTLE BIT HERE.

19:58:01 ALL RIGHT.

19:58:03 SO THIS IS THE GREEN MAP.

19:58:09 AND THEN I'LL SWITCH BACK TO 91064.

19:58:14 SO IT'S REALLY THE SAME  BOUNDARIES.

19:58:16 >> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.

19:58:25 >> SO FOR DISTRICT 6, BOTH OF THESE MAPS ARE REALLY PROPOSING IN THE EXACT 
19:58:31 SAME -- AND WHEN YOU SEE WHATEVER, IT'S SOMETIMES JUST THE HIGHWAY, THAT'S NOT 
19:58:32 AN ACTUAL BOUNDARY CHANGE.

19:58:35 >> Councilmember Cox: GOT IT.

19:58:43 >> SO BOTH OF THOSE ARE DOING SAME CUT OF THIS AREA HERE.

19:58:46 THIS GOMES AREA.

19:58:51 >> OKAY.

19:58:56 I SEE.

19:59:01 BECAUSE THAT ONE HAS A LITTLE BIT MORE -- A LITTLE BIT OF MISSION INCLUDED AS 
19:59:05 PART OF THE IRVINGTON DISTRICT 6.

19:59:10 OKAY.

19:59:12 >> HERE'S BRUCE THAT YOU WERE ASKING ABOUT, RIGHT, TOO.

19:59:17 THAT STAYS IN 6.

19:59:18 >> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.

19:59:18 GOT IT.

19:59:23 I JUST WANTED TO DOUBLE-CHECK AS I WAS TRYING TO TRACE THE MAP THERE.

19:59:28 I LOVE HOW YOU'VE BEEN ABLE TO MAGNIFY IT A LOT BETTER THAN WHAT I CAN DO ON 
19:59:30 OUR HOME COMPUTERS HERE.

19:59:31 THAT'S BEEN VERY HELPFUL.

19:59:32 THANK YOU FOR THE CLARIFICATION THERE.

19:59:34 I APPRECIATE IT.

19:59:35 >> YOU'RE VERY WELCOME.

19:59:38 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:59:42 NEXT I ALSO HAVE COUNCILMEMBER SHAO, YOUR HAND IS RAISED?

19:59:44 >> Councilmember Shao: THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR.

19:59:52 ONE MORE THING I WANT TO ADD IS THAT WHEN I LOOK AT THE MAP OF REVISED 
19:59:59 GREEN MAP, ACTUALLY DISTRICT 4 IS THE ONLY DISTRICT THAT BORDERS WITH 
20:00:08 EVERYONE, AND IF YOU LOOK AT IT, IT BORDERS WITH DISTRICT 1, ON DECOTO, IT 
20:00:16 BORDERS WITH DISTRICT 2 ON FREMONT, BORDERS WITH DISTRICT 3 ON PERALTA, 
20:00:26 AND MISSION, AND THEN DISTRICT 6, WASHINGTON AND FREMONT  BOULEVARD, AND 
20:00:33 THEN OF COURSE BORDERS WITH DISTRICT 5 AT 680.

20:00:40 SO IT IS THE DISTRICT THAT BASICALLY PRESENTS -- REPRESENTS EVERYONE OR NO 
20:00:50 ONE, AND BASICALLY WOULD JUST GO FROM ONE END OF THE CITY TO THE OTHER, AND 
20:00:57 IT INCLUDES, AS I SAID MULTIPLE ATTENDING AREAS OR NEIGHBORHOODS, AND 
20:01:05 CERTAINLY IT IS NOT COMPLYING WITH THE RULE OR PRINCIPLE OF BEING COMPACT.

20:01:11 SO COMPACTNESS IS BEING -- IS IN QUESTION IN MY OPINION.

20:01:19 >> Mayor Mei: SO I WANTED TO MAKE A COMMENT TOO.

20:01:25 I THINK THAT I'VE DEFINITELY HEARD THE COUNCILMEMBERS' COMMENTS, AND WE'VE 
20:01:34 DEFINITELY HEARD COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, TRYING TO PRESERVE THE GLENMOOR AREA, 
20:01:45 AT THIS MOMENT, 91064, I REMEMBER SEEING THE GREEN SHEET FOR THAT, BUT 
20:01:51 BECAUSE I KNOW IT'S VERY IMPORTANT AS NOTED BY COUNCILMEMBER JONES TO HAVE 
20:01:51 WASHINGTON HIGH SCHOOL.

20:01:57 AND THE NILES AREA AS IT'S CURRENTLY DRAWN DOES GO WITH CENTERVILLE IN 
20:02:05 TERMS OF THE ATTENDANCE AREA AND THAT LEADS TO THAT COMPACTNESS AND PULLS IT 
20:02:06 INTO THE WASHINGTON HIGH SCHOOL AREA.

20:02:13 AND THEN ALSO I THINK THAT WHEN IT LOOKS AT SOME OF THE POPULATION, I 
20:02:18 THINK IT GIVES SOME MORE COMPACTNESS IN TERMS OF THE LINES BEING MORE -- I 
20:02:22 THINK THEN IT LIMITS IT ONLY TO FOUR BORDERS RATHER THAN THREE, BECAUSE 
20:02:29 RIGHT NOW, RATHER THAN ALL FIVE, RIGHT NOW THE WAY IT IS ON THE REVISED GREEN 
20:02:36 MAP, IT SEEMS TO BORDER EVERY ONE OF THE OTHER DISTRICTS.

20:02:42 SO I THINK THAT THAT IS A PERSONAL PREFERENCE, LOOKING AT THAT, SO IT 
20:02:46 TRIES TO KEEP THE ATTENDANCE AREA SOMEWHAT TOGETHER, BECAUSE I THINK 
20:02:53 THAT THAT HAS BEEN A QUESTION AT TIMES, BECAUSE THERE HAS BEEN THAT BOUNDARY 
20:02:57 USUALLY OF MOWRY WHERE PEOPLE THEN GO INTO THE WASHINGTON HIGH ATTENDANCE 
20:02:57 AREA.

20:03:03 AND WANTING TO KEEP THAT, FROM MY OPINION, TOGETHER RATHER THAN DIVIDED 
20:03:07 BECAUSE THAT IS A NATURAL LINE THAT PARENTS AND OTHER PEOPLE HAVE 
20:03:08 COMMENTED ON TO ME.

20:03:15 SO I ALSO WANTED TO JUST NOTE, ONE OF THE COMMENTS THAT WE MADE EARLIER, AND 
20:03:23 I'D BE CURIOUS IF THE DEMOGRAPHER COULD COMMENT ON THAT, IS THAT WITH 
20:03:26 DISTRICT, BECAUSE RIGHT NOW WHEN WE DID OUR CENSUS, IT DIDN'T HAVE THE ABILITY 
20:03:33 TO ENCAPSULATE ALL THE NEW RESIDENTS BECAUSE THEY HADN'T MOVED IN AND 
20:03:39 HADN'T COMPLETED THE CENSUS, SO HOPEFULLY DISTRICT 5 IS GIVEN MORE OF 
20:03:43 AN OPPORTUNITY FOR GROWTH, BECAUSE WE KNOW IT WON'T ARE FOR ANOTHER 10 
20:03:48 YEARS, SO MAKING SURE THAT WE TAKE THAT INTO CONSIDERATION TOO.

20:03:53 >> YOU CAN SEE ON 91064, AND I BELIEVE IT'S EXACTLY THE SAME ON THE GREEN 
20:04:00 MAP, THAT THE DEVIATION FOR DISTRICT 5 IS NEGATIVE, MEANING THAT THIS 
20:04:03 DISTRICT IS ABOUT 500 PEOPLE UNDERPOPULATED.

20:04:09 THAT'S NOT A LOT, BUT IT'S MUCH BETTER THAN HAVING IT, FOR INSTANCE, BE, YOU 
20:04:11 KNOW, WITH THOUSAND PEOPLE OVERPOPULATED.

20:04:17 BECAUSE IF YOU DO EXPECT A LOT OF GROWTH IN THAT DISTRICT, YOU WILL BE 
20:04:24 BETTER POSITIONED FOR LESS CHANGES IN 10 YEARS IF YOU DO KEEP THIS DISTRICT 
20:04:30 ON THE UNDERPOPULATED SIDE RATHER THAN THE OVERALL POPULATED SIDE.

20:04:32 >> Mayor Mei: THAT'S WHAT I JUST WANTED TO NOTE.

20:04:36 I REMEMBER SEEING THAT BULL THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT WE'VE NOTED BEFORE.

20:04:39 COUNCILMEMBER JONES, DID YOU HAVE YOUR HAND RAISED?

20:04:40 AND I HAVEN'T SEEN VICE MAYOR.

20:04:42 I'M LOOKING.

20:04:46 TO SEE IF HE THAT'S ANY  COMMENTS.

20:04:47 >> THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR.

20:04:54 THE ONLY COMMENT I HAVE  REGARDING THE SCHOOL ATTENDANCE AREAS, I PERSONALLY 
20:04:57 DON'T THINK THERE'S REALLY A WAY TO DO IT FOLLOWING THE SCHOOL ATTENDANCE 
20:05:03 AREAS, BUT MY COMMENT ABOUT 91064, IF THAT'S THE CORRECT NUMBER, WOULD BE 
20:05:15 THAT, YES, NILES DOES ATTEND WASHINGTON HIGH, HOWEVER, 91064 REMOVES ALL OF 
20:05:22 GLENMOOR, WHICH HAS TRADITIONALLY BEEN THE -- ATTENDANCE AREA AS WELL.

20:05:23 JUST WANTED TO POINT THAT OUT.

20:05:24 THANK YOU.

20:05:33 >> Mayor Mei: I GUESS WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A TRADEOFF NO MATTER WHICH WAY WE 
20:05:34 LOOK AT IT.

20:05:35 LET'S SEE.

20:05:38 >> Councilmember Kassan: I'M A LITTLE CONFUSED.

20:05:44 HOW DOES IT REMOVE GLENMOOR FROM WASHINGTON HIGH 91604?

20:05:45 I DON'T SEE THAT.

20:05:54 >> Mayor Mei: IT'S IN 2 OR 3, RIGHT, EITHER WAY, SO --

20:06:10 >> GLENMOOR AND -- ARE NOT IN THE SAME DISTRICT IN -- TAKES IN PART OF 
20:06:13 WASHINGTON, NILES GOES TO WASHINGTON, BUT THERE'S A SECTION RIGHT IN THE 
20:06:17 MIDDLE OF THOSE TWO NEIGHBORHOODS THAT ATTEND AMERICA.

20:06:21 SO I MEAN, BOTH OF THEM KIND OF ACCOMPLISH THE SAME THING WITH KEEPING 
20:06:23 THE NEIGHBORHOODS TOGETHER.

20:06:28 AGAIN, THE GOAM AND WHAT I'VE HEARD FROM SOME OF THE RESIDENTS IS KEEP THE 
20:06:34 LINES CLEAN, KEEP IT SIMPLE, AND THIS IS A SUBSTANTIAL CHANGE FOR THE NORTH 
20:06:36 END OF TOWN.

20:06:42 SO I'M JUST KIND PASSING ALONG WHAT I'VE HEARD FROM MY RESIDENTS.

20:06:42 THANK YOU.

20:06:44 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

20:06:55 I'LL SEE IF THERE'S ANY OTHER COMMENTS.

20:06:57 VICE MAYOR SALWAN, I HAVE NOT HEARD FROM YOU YET.

20:07:02 >> Vice Mayor Salwan: THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR.

20:07:04 WELL, I'M SITTING HERE CONFUSED.

20:07:06 BOTH ARGUMENTS SOUND VERY GOOD TO ME.

20:07:21 IN GENERAL, I WOULD SAY THE GREEN MAP, THE RESIZED, IS  MOST -- HOW IT 
20:07:21 CURRENTLY LOOKS.

20:07:27 SO I THINK THE ALWAYS ISSUE WAS THE LINE ON MOWRY, I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE 
20:07:32 HAD A CONCERN ABOUT THAT, AND THAT AREA WOULD HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A PART OF 
20:07:39 DISTRICT 2 IF WHAT SOME OF THE FOLKS WANTED AT THAT TIME, THEY HAVE AT 
20:07:40 MOWRY.

20:07:45 I'M NOT REALLY HAPPY WITH ANY OF THESE, TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, BUT THESE ARE 
20:07:50 THE DECISIONS WE HAVE IN FRONT OF US.

20:07:54 BETWEEN THE TWO, I'D PROBABLY GO WITH THE REVISED AGREEMENT THIS TIME.

20:07:57 

20:08:08 >> AND IT'S WORTH ALSO SHOWING YOU, I THINK, A REVISE 115088 BECAUSE IT DOES 
20:08:09 SOME SIMILAR THINGS.

20:08:15 SO THIS ONE IS WORTH TAKING A GLANCE AT AS WELL.

20:08:22 >> Mayor Mei: STRAIGHT LINES, PRETTY STRAIGHT LINES.

20:08:24 >> Vice Mayor Salwan: CAN WE GO BACK TO THE OTHER ONE AGAIN?

20:08:25 >> YES.

20:08:27 NDC GREEN.

20:08:36 

20:08:39 >> Vice Mayor Salwan: WELL, I GUESS I'LL WAIT TO HEAR WHAT COUNCILMEMBER 
20:08:41 COX HAS TO SAY AND WE CAN GO FROM THERE.

20:08:45 >> Councilmember Cox: AND WHICH ONE WERE YOU REFERRING TO?

20:08:47 THE GREEN VERSUS THE OTHER TWO?

20:09:04 >> Mayor Mei:  -- 910646 WAS ONE AND THE OTHER ONE WAS 115099.

20:09:04 IS THAT WHAT IT IS?

20:09:06 I REMEMBER YOU JUST CLICKED ON IT.

20:09:12 >> SO 8 AGE 15088.

20:09:18 BOTH OF THESE ARE BETTER NORTH PREMONTH MAPS, BUT THEY ARE BROTH POPULATION 
20:09:19 BALANCED.

20:09:25 99 ACTUALLY MAKES CHANGES TO DISTRICT 1 HERE.

20:09:26 YOU CAN SEE.

20:09:32 >> Councilmember Cox: AND DRIX 6 TOO.

20:09:37 >> YEAH, SO THAT DISTRICT 6 IS GETTING MORE CHANGES IN THE  BETTER NORTH 
20:09:47 FREMONT MAPS, BUT BOTH OF THEM ARE ADDRESSING THE ISSUE OF THE 
20:09:54 COMPACTNESS OF MAKING DISTRICT 4 COMPACT,  UNIFYING, CLEARLY WHOEVER 
20:09:59 DREW THESE MAPS WERE LISTENING TO YOUR COMMENTS AT THE VARIOUS MEETING ABOUT 
20:10:01 CENTERVILLE AND GLENMOOR.

20:10:02 SO I THINK THAT --

20:10:03 >> Mayor Mei: THEY OBVIOUSLY HEARD.

20:10:05 >> THEY OBVIOUSLY HEARD.

20:10:05 >> Mayor Mei: YES.

20:10:15 >> THEN OF COURSE THERE MAY BE CONCERN AROUND THE I EVER TON AREA.

20:10:23 WHEN I LOOKED AT THE DATA AS IT WAS -- DISTRICT SICK WAS THE LARGEST 
20:10:23 POPULATION.

20:10:37 >> SO ALL OF THESE MAPS WE'RE DISCUSSING -- 115099 IS ACTUALLY THE 
20:10:39 LOWEST OF ALL THE ONES WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

20:10:43 THIS ONE HAS THE DEVIATION OF 6.62%.

20:10:46 THE REASON THAT THIS HAS A LOWER DEVIATION THAN ALL THE OTHER ONES 
20:10:52 WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS BECAUSE IT ACTUALLY --

20:10:54 >> Mayor Mei: LONG PART OF 5.

20:10:54 >> YEP.

20:11:04 AND THEN THE GREENERY ADVISED MAP IS A TOTAL DEVIATION OF 7.01%, AND 91064 
20:11:08 HAS A TOTAL DEVIATION OF 7.28%.

20:11:18 SO ALL OF THESE, I WOULD SAY ARE COMPARABLE IN TERMS OF THE POPULATION 
20:11:23 QUALITY, AND NDC IS CURRENTLY RECOMMENDING THAT OUR CLIENTS NOT ONLY 
20:11:32 STAY UNDER 10% SO 9% ARE GOOD IN TERMS OF DEVIATION AND POPULATION  BALANCE.

20:11:36 >> Mayor Mei: AND THEN YOU SAID THAT THE MAPS THAT WERE SUBMITTED MOST 
20:11:43 RECENTLY FROM THE PUBLIC ALSO MUST HAVE HEARD OUR COMMENDS.

20:11:44 PRETTY IMPRESSIVE.

20:11:46 AT LEAST THEY UNDERSTAND HOW TO BALANCE IT.

20:11:52 SO IT LOOKS LIKE -- OKAY.

20:12:00 MAKES A BIG CHANGE IN FIVE.

20:12:07 BUT I GUESS THAT WOULD ALSO START ADDRESSING THE FUTURE AS WE SAID IN 5 
20:12:09 BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO BE SEEING SUBSTANTIAL GROWTH.

20:12:14 HOW MUCH DIFFERENCE IN THE TWO TRADES IN THE MAPS THAT WERE SUBMITTED FOR --

20:12:17 >> JUST IN TERMS OF DISTRICT 5?

20:12:18 I DON'T HAVE THAT OPEN.

20:12:21 LET ME OPEN THAT THE GIVE ME JUST ONE SECOND HERE.

20:12:23 >> Mayor Mei: SURE.

20:12:33 >> City Mgr. Shackelford: MAYOR, RIGHT NOW THIS CREATES CHALLENGES WITH 
20:12:36 SEEING ALL OF THE HANDS BUT I JUST WANT TO MAKE YOU AWARE THAT COUNCILMEMBER 
20:12:38 KASSAN HAS HER HAND RAISED.

20:12:39 >> Mayor Mei: YES, THANK YOU.

20:12:41 I WAS JUST GOING TO HAVE HER BRING IT UP.

20:12:42 >> City Mgr. Shackelford:ABSOLU TELY.

20:12:43 CONTINUE.

20:12:56 WIN WIN SO TO THE POINT THAT THE BETTER NORTH FREMONT MAPS, WHAT HAPPENS WITH 
20:12:56 DISTRICT 5?

20:13:02 BOTH OF THEM JUST SLIGHTLY OVERTOP LATE DISTRICT 5 THE.

20:13:03 >> Mayor Mei: WE DON'T WANT TO OVERPOPULATE DISTRICT 35.

20:13:06  5.

20:13:07 COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN?

20:13:11 AS LEAST I DON'T WANT TO OVERPOPULATE DISTRICT 5.

20:13:12 >> Councilmember Kassan: THANK YOU.

20:13:16 SO A COUPLE COMMENTS.

20:13:21 THE ONE YOU JUST SHOWED, THAT GREATER NORTH FREMONT SUBMITTED, TO ME THAT'S 
20:13:27 MUCH MORE SIMILAR TO THE NUMBER THAT I KEEP FORGETTING, 946104 OR WHATEVER IT 
20:13:28 IS.

20:13:32 9121 OH SH WHATEVER IT IS.

20:13:34 >> THAT'S WHAT I KEPT THINKING.

20:13:39 >> Councilmember Kassan: TO ME IT'S MUCH MORE SIMILAR TO THAT ONE.

20:13:48 BUT I THINK MY LARGER -- I FEEL LIKE MANY OF US ARE NOT SUPER EXPERT AT 
20:13:56 DESCRIBING MAPS, AND I FEEL LIKE PEOPLE ARE MAKING STATEMENTS THAT ARE 
20:13:57 CONTRADICTING EACH OTHER.

20:14:02 PERSONALLY I WOULD LOVE MORE GUIDANCE FROM YOU AS THE EXPERT, YOU KNOW, 
20:14:07 BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE THERE ARE SOME STATEMENTS BEING MADE THAT DON'T SEEM 
20:14:11 CORRECT TO ME, BUT I COULD BE WRONG BECAUSE I MIGHT JUST NOT UNDERSTAND  
20:14:16 WHAT'S BEING SAID, SO I JUST WOULD LOVE FOR YOU TO MAKE SOME MORE, FOR 
20:14:24 EXAMPLE, THE QUESTION OF IS GLENMOOR BROKEN UP, IS CENTERVILLE BROKEN UP, 
20:14:28 ALL THESE THINGS, I FEEL LIKE IT WOULD BE HELPFUL IF YOU WEIGHED IN A LITTLE 
20:14:32 BIT MORE WHEN PEOPLE MAKE THOSE STATEMENTS, BECAUSE I'M NOT SUPER 
20:14:36 COMFORTABLE TOTALLY UNDERSTANDING THESE MAPS MYSELF, AND I'M HEARING THINGS 
20:14:40 THAT I'M NOT EVEN TOTALLY UNDERSTANDING WHAT THE COUNCILMEMBER MEANS WHEN THEY 
20:14:41 SAY IT.

20:14:45 >> I THINK SOME OF THE CONFUSION MAY BE --

20:14:47 >> City Mgr. Shackelford:KRISTE N, BEFORE YOU GO INTO THAT, AND ALSO IF 
20:14:52 MAYBE YOU COULD JUST TAKE A STEP BACK AND SUMMARIZE HOW YOU DEVELOPED THE 
20:14:57 REVISED MAPS THAT YOU DID, BASED ON THE COMMENTS THAT YOU HEARD FROM THE 
20:14:58 PREVIOUS PUBLIC HEARING.

20:15:01 SO JUST KIND OF A GENERAL RECAP OF THAT.

20:15:05 >> YEAH, SURE.

20:15:08 >> Councilmember Kassan: SORRY TO INTERRUPT ON THAT, KARENA, BUT I DON'T 
20:15:13 KNOW IF THAT'S TOTALLY NECESSARY BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE WE'RE GIVEN THESE 
20:15:16 TWO MAPS AND NOW WE'RE KIND OF TRYING TO EXPLAIN THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN 
20:15:17 THEM.

20:15:23 I MEAN, THAT'S FINE, BUT I FEEL -- THAT DOESN'T EXACTLY ADDRESS WHAT I'M 
20:15:27 ASKING, WHICH IS REALLY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE DIFFERENCES ARE BETWEEN THE 
20:15:28 TWO OF THEM.

20:15:32 >> City Mgr. Shackelford: I APPRECIATE THAT, I JUST FEEL IT'S A TWO-PRONGED 
20:15:38 APPROACH  BASED ON WHAT -- SO BY ALL MEANS ADDRESS THE COUNCILMEMBERS' 
20:15:40 INTEREST.

20:15:44 >> AND I THINK, COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, YOU'RE ASKING THE RIGHT QUESTION, 
20:15:48 WHICH IS WHAT ARE THE BIG DIFFERENCES HERE BETWEEN THESE MAPS.

20:15:57 NOT JUST WHETHER YOU'RE INTO TWO OR THREE, BUT IF YOU SWITCH BETWEEN THEM, 
20:16:06 IT REALLY, I THINK THE BIGGEST CHANGES ARE BETWEEN 910864 AND NDC GREEN.

20:16:15 THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCES ARE REALLY OCCURRING WITH DISTRICT 2 AND DISTRICT 4.

20:16:19 I DO THINK THERE IS A COMPELLING ARGUMENT ABOUT HAVING DISTRICT 4 BE 
20:16:22 MORE COMPACT.

20:16:34 HOWEVER, I ALSO THINK THAT WHEN WE DO THAT, WE END UP WITH THESE BOUNDARIES 
20:16:37 HERE THAT ARE NOT NECESSARILY EASILY IDENTIFIABLE.

20:16:42 WHICH IS A SLIGHTLY HIGHER PRIORITY THAN COMPACTNESS.

20:16:48 SO ALL OF THIS IS A TRADEOFF, BUT I WILL ENCOURAGE EVERYONE TO REALLY 
20:16:55 FOCUS ON NEIGHBORHOODS AND COMMUNITIES OF INTEREST, BECAUSE THAT IS REALLY 
20:17:00 THE MOST LEGALLY SIGNIFICANT CRITERIA THAT WE WANT TO THINK ABOUT.

20:17:06 AND YOU KNOW, IT'S OKAY TO HAVE A NON-COMPACT DISTRICT IF WE HAVE A 
20:17:07 REASON FOR IT.

20:17:17 SO I WILL SAY THAT LEGALLY, BUT YOU KNOW, THIS IS CHALLENGING.

20:17:26 I WILL DEFINITELY SAY THIS IS NOT ONE OF THE EASIEST CITIES TO DRAW MAPS FOR 
20:17:30 BECAUSE OF THE SHAPE OF IT AND WHERE THE POPULATION IS AND WHERE THE 
20:17:31 NEIGHBORHOODS ARE.

20:17:41 IN GENERAL, I WOULD DISCOURAGE THE USE OF SCHOOL ATTENDANCE ZONE, BECAUSE 
20:17:51 THAT IS LESS ACTUALLY RELEVANT TO CITY COUNCIL ELECTION, EVEN THOUGH IT'S 
20:17:53 VERY FAMILIAR FOR THE PUBLIC.

20:17:56 >> City Mgr. Shackelford: SO KRISTEN, THANK YOU FOR ANSWERING COUNCILMEMBER 
20:17:57 KASSAN'S QUESTION.

20:17:59 DOES THAT HELP, COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN?

20:18:04 >> Councilmember Kassan: IT  DOES, AND I JUST WOULD LOVE FOR YOU TO KIND OF 
20:18:08 CHIME IN WHEN PEOPLE ARE MAKING STATEMENTS THAT COULD MAYBE USE SOME 
20:18:12 EXPERT COMMENTARY TO MAKE SURE WE'RE ALL CORRECT.

20:18:16 >> City Mgr. Shackelford: OKAY.

20:18:17 THANK YOU FOR THAT.

20:18:21 AND THEN I'LL JUST REITERATE THAT I THINK THAT BASED ON THE CONVERSATION 
20:18:29 THAT I'M HEARING, IT WOULD BE GOOD FOR KRISTEN TO JUST KIND OF SUMMARIZE 
20:18:35 AGAIN HOW SHE ARRIVED AT THE REVISED MAPS BASED ON THE COMMENTS THAT SHE 
20:18:41 HEARD AFTER THE PREVIOUS PUBLIC HEARING, BUT BEFORE SHE DOES THAT, I 
20:18:44 SEE THERE ARE OTHER HANDS RAISED AND I DEFINITELY WANT TO DEFER TO THE 
20:18:46 COUNCILMEMBERS BECAUSE THIS IS YOUR DISCUSSION TO HAVE.

20:18:48 BUT I JUST WANTED TO SHARE WITH YOU WHAT I'M HEARING.

20:18:54 MAYOR MEI?

20:18:57 >> Mayor Mei: I WANTED TODAY NOTE QUICKLY FOR THE PUBLIC, WHEN I LOOK AT 
20:19:01 THE ELECTIONS IN 2022, ALL THREE OF THEM ARE COMING UP ANYWAYS, DISTRICT 
20:19:08 2, 3 AND 4, SO IT WOULDN'T MAKE A DIFFERENCE, BUT ALL THREE WILL BE 
20:19:09 VOTING.

20:19:14 IT'S JUST WHICH DISTRICT YOU'LL BE VOTING IN, IT WILL PROBABLY BE 
20:19:15 DIFFERENT.

20:19:18 COUNCILMEMBER SHAO.

20:19:23 COUNCILMEMBER SHAO?

20:19:24 >> Councilmember Shao: SURE.

20:19:25 THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR.

20:19:36 I WAS ALSO CURIOUS ABOUT THE REVISED 91064, AT THE BOUNDARY BETWEEN 
20:19:44 DISTRICT 3 AND 4, AND THE CLEAR BORDER RIGHT THERE.

20:19:51 I WAS LOOKING AT THE POPULATION RIGHT NOW FOR THIS REVISED ONE, AND DISTRICT 
20:19:59 4 TILELY IS THE ONE WITH THE HIGHEST POPULATION, SO BY MAKING SOME 
20:20:10 ADJUSTMENT AT THE BORDER TO MAKE IT MORE VISIBLE AND MORE EVEN, EVEN BY 
20:20:17 LOSING SOME OF THE POPULATIONS, DISTRICT 4 CAN STILL KEEP THE 
20:20:17 DEVIATION IN CHECK.

20:20:26 SO I CERTAINLY DON'T UNDERSTAND, ESPECIALLY, FOR EXAMPLE, IF WE JUST 
20:20:33 DIVIDE ALONG FREMONT BOULEVARD WHAT DIFFERENCE OR HOW MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE 
20:20:34 IT WOULD MAKE.

20:20:38 >> YEAH, UNFORTUNATELY, IT MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE.

20:20:47 THERE'S A LOT OF FOLKS IN HERE, AND IT PUSHES EVEN THREE, I BELIEVE EVEN 
20:20:50 UPWARDS OF 5 OR 6% OVERPOPULATION.

20:20:54 SO THIS IS EXACTLY THE TRICKY AREA.

20:20:59 THIS IS ONE WAY TO DIVIDE IT.

20:21:03 WE COULD ALSO DIVIDE IT THE WAY THAT THE BETTER NORTH FREMONT DOES.

20:21:12 AND THIS MAY -- IF WE FOLLOWED THIS DIVISION, THAT MAY GIVE US SIMILAR 
20:21:12 POPULATION.

20:21:16 BUT IT HAS TO BE DIVIDED.

20:21:18 I'M SORRY, I FORGOT THE NAME OF THIS NEIGHBORHOOD.

20:21:20 IS IT SUN SOMETHING?

20:21:24 >> SUNDALE.

20:21:24 >> SUNDALE.

20:21:30 >>.

20:21:36 >> Councilmember Shao: ALSO FREMONT HUB IS RIGHT THERE, AND FREMONT HUB IS 
20:21:37 DOESN'T HAVE --

20:21:39 >> RIGHT, THERE'S NO POPULATION RIGHT HERE.

20:21:40 YOU'RE EXACTLY RIGHT.

20:21:48 >> Mayor Mei: BECAUSE I THINK THE LINE THERE, THE ONE MAP YOU JUST SHOWED THE 
20:21:50 ALTERNATIVE WAS CLEANER, DEFINITELY.

20:21:53 >> Mayor Mei: IT'S DEFINITELY CLEANER.

20:21:54 >> Councilmember Shao: RIGHT.

20:21:55 >> Mayor Mei: MUCH CLEANER.

20:22:09 BECAUSE THAT'S MAJOR CORRIDORS, SO IT'S EASY TO DELINEATE.

20:22:13 WALNUT.

20:22:19 AT LEAST -- I APOLOGIZE, MY VISION IS BAD SO I'M LEANING INTO MY COMPUTER.

20:22:20 >> YEAH.

20:22:29 WELL, I'M CERTAINLY HAPPY TO SEE IF IT POSSIBLE TO MAKE THAT CHANGE TO 91064.

20:22:31 >> Councilmember Shao: RIGHT.

20:22:35 >> AND MAKE THAT A MORE  LOGICAL --

20:22:39 >> THAT MAKES A LOT MORE SENSE,.

20:22:40 >> BECAUSE THERE ARE OPTIONS.

20:22:45 I KNOW WHEN I WAS GOING THROUGH THEM WITH STAFF, WE KNOW THERE'S OPTIONS 
20:22:45 THERE.

20:22:53 >> Councilmember Shao:ESPECIALL Y IN THE LOWER LEFT CORNER IS ALMOST LIKE 
20:23:04 OPEN MOUTH RIGHT THERE, THAT DEFINITELY IS NOT [INAUDIBLE]

20:23:04 >> Mayor Mei: OKAY.

20:23:05 COUNCILMEMBER JONES.

20:23:10 >> Councilmember Jones: THANK YOU.

20:23:14 EVERYTHING IS SO SMALL, I'M  HAVING TO REALLY TRY AND ZOOM  IN.

20:23:19 KRISTEN, IS THIS 91064 CURRENTLY ON THE SCREEN?

20:23:21 >> YES.

20:23:26 >> Councilmember Jones: CAN YOU GO TO THE NORTH, TO THE CENTERVILLE DISTRICT?

20:23:38 I JUST WANT TO -- IT DOESN'T SEEM TO --

20:23:44 >> Mayor Mei: IT'S ON PASEO PADRE, MAJOR CORRIDORS.

20:23:46 THORNTON.

20:23:49 >> Councilmember Jones: WELL, I SEE THAT'S THE NORTHERN BORDER ON THIS MAP.

20:23:57 HOWEVER, I'M LOOKING AT THE MAP ONLINE AND IT SHOWS THAT ACTUALLY AS BECAME 
20:24:03 STREET, WHICH IS ALONG THE RAIL YOE TRAM, THAT'S WHY I WANTED TO CLARIFY 
20:24:11 IF I'M SEEING THINGS OR BECAUSE I KNOW WHAT I'M SEEING ON THE DISTRICT 
20:24:15 WEBSITE DOES NOT INCORPORATE FREMONT BOULEVARD ALL THE WAY UP TO THORNTON 
20:24:16 AVENUE.

20:24:22 >> YOU MAY BE LOOKING AT THE NON-REVISED VERSION, I WONDER?

20:24:30 >> City Mgr. Shackelford:COUNCI LMEMBER JONES, YOU OFFERED ME YOUR GLASSES AT 
20:24:34 OUR RETREAT LAST FRIDAY.

20:24:35 I NEED THEM AGAIN.

20:24:36 I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING.

20:24:41 >> BECAUSE IT DOES GO VERY CLEARLY, THORNTON TO PASEO PADRE TO MOWRY.

20:24:44 >> Councilmember Jones: RIGHT, THAT'S WHERE THE CONFUSION IS.

20:24:49 THERE'S ACTUALLY ONLY 91064 LISTED ON THE DISTRICTING WEBSITE.

20:24:50 >> OH, IT'S AT THE VERY TOP.

20:24:52 I'M SO SORRY.

20:24:59 SO WHAT WE DID WAS WE PUT AT THE VERY TOP THE TWO REVISIONS.

20:25:02 I HAD THE SAME CONFUSION ACTUALLY MYSELF EARLIER TODAY.

20:25:06 >> Councilmember Jones: KE VERY TOP OF --

20:25:07 >> THE THE PAGE THERE.

20:25:09 I'LL SHOW YOU ON MY SCREEN.

20:25:17 >> Councilmember Jones: SO THAT TAKES TO THORNTON AVENUE, WHICH I SEE.

20:25:18 >> YES.

20:25:29 >> Mayor Mei: VICE MAYOR SALWAN?

20:25:31 YOU HAVE YOUR HAND RAISED TOO.

20:25:32 >> YES.

20:25:36 I WAS SEEING IF WE COULD GO BACK TO THE NDC GREEN MAP REVISED.

20:25:44 HAVE YOU LOOKED AT -- SO TWO, I THINK OF THE WAY IT IS NOW, IT START FROM 
20:25:52 DECOTO ON, HAD WE LOOKED AT COMBINING 3 WITH NILES, IS THAT A POSSIBILITY IT 
20:25:55 COULD ADDRESS -- HELP ADDRESS SOME OF THISH OOO YOUS?

20:26:02 >> I MEAN, THAT WILL INVOLVE A LOT OF TRADEOFFS.

20:26:08 WE'VE OBVIOUSLY LOOKED -- WE HAVE OPTIONS THAT COMBINE 2 WITH NILES.

20:26:15 >> Vice Mayor Salwan: SO YOU LEAVE 2 AS WEST OF FREMONT BOULEVARD, THREE COULD 
20:26:20 BE -- IT'S THE BEST ONE WE'RE KIND OF CHANGING A LITTLE BIT, SO IF YOU ADD 
20:26:24 NILES AND PART OF DOWNTOWN FREMONT, FOURTH, I MEAN, YOU KIND OF TWEAK A 
20:26:30 LITTLE BIT, MAYBE GIVE THE AREA AROUND THE LAKE ELIZABETH, SOME OF THOSE 
20:26:30 SPOTS.

20:26:40 AND THEN YOU CAN HAVE MORE OF A COMPACT 4, AND THEN 3 COULD BE KIND OF THIS 
20:26:40 NEW DISTRICT.

20:26:50 >> YEAH, IT'S REALLY, REALLY HARD FOR ME TO BALLPARK IT WITH FREMONT.

20:26:57 I CAN BALLPARK IT MAYBE WITH SOME OTHER PLACES, BUT EVERY CHANGE HERE IS GOING 
20:27:05 TO HAVE A PIP EL EFFECT, SO I'M HAPPY TO EXPLORE THAT IN A MAP, BUT 
20:27:14  UNFORTUNATELY TIMING WISE, WE DO HOPE THAT YOU'LL COME TO A FINAL DECISION SOON.

20:27:17 >> Vice Mayor Salwan: IS THAT SOMETHING YOU CAN DO TODAY OR IS THAT NOT ENOUGH 
20:27:18 TIME?

20:27:23 >> NO, I CANNOT DO THAT FOR YOU TODAY.

20:27:28 I COULD PROVIDE YOU BY MONDAY ANY NEW MAPS OR REVISIONS.

20:27:33 I CAN MAKE SMALL REVISIONS BY THE END OF THIS WEEK, BUT IF WE'RE TALKING 
20:27:36 ABOUT ANY WHOLE NEW MAP, THAT I WOULD NEED UNTIL MONDAY.

20:27:39 >> Vice Mayor Salwan: BEFORE I TAKE ANY OF YOUR TIME, IS THERE ANY INTEREST 
20:27:41 FROM OTHER COUNCILMEMBERS IN THAT?

20:27:44 I DON'T WANT TO SPEND A BUNCH OF TIME.

20:27:49 >> Mayor Mei: I'D BE WILLING TO EXPLORE THAT, JUST BECAUSE 3 IS STILL VACANT.

20:27:51 I'D LIKE TO KEEP THAT TOGETHER SOMEHOW IF POSSIBLE.

20:27:56 >> Councilmember Shao: I'D LIKE TO ATTEND THAT -- ENTERTAIN THAT IDEA 
20:28:00 TOO, BECAUSE OF THE CONCERN OF THE COMPACTEDNESS.

20:28:06 >> Councilmember Jones: I DON'T HAVE AN ISSUE WITH THAT.

20:28:11 AND KRISTEN, REALLY QUICK, I DID SEE THE OTHER REVISION YOU HAD.

20:28:13 >> OH, GOOD.

20:28:14 I KNOW.

20:28:21 >> Councilmember Kassan: I HAVE A CLARIFYING QUESTION AROUND WHAT YOU 
20:28:22 WERE JUST TALKING  ABOUT.

20:28:27 ARE YOU SAYING ADD NILES TO DISTRICT 3?

20:28:34 >> Vice Mayor Salwan: IS THAT FOR ME, COUNCILMEMBER?

20:28:46 DISTRICT 3 AND NORTH NILES, THOSE COULD BE EBBS MORED TO CONNECT THOSE TWO, 
20:28:50 SINCE THERE'S AN ISSUE ABOUT NILES BEING MORE NORTHERN PART.

20:28:55 AND THERE'S CONCERN ABOUT GLENMOOR BEING KEPT TOGETHER, THE CENTERVILLE 
20:28:59 BUSINESS DISTRICT KEPT TOGETHER, THAT'S ALL WEST OF FREMONT BOULEVARD SO THAT 
20:29:01 WOULD BE WHOLE.

20:29:06 DISTRICT 3 IS SOMETHING THAT STILL NEEDS TO BE DEFINED, AND SO I THOUGHT 
20:29:14 THAT WOULD BE ANOTHER WAY OF LOOKING AT IT SO WE CAN ADDRESS ALL THE DIFFERENT 
20:29:16 COUNCILMEMBERS INPUT BEFORE.

20:29:25 >> Councilmember Cox:COUNCILMEM BER COX, STHAR REGARDING 2 AND 3 -- I MEAN 
20:29:26 3 AND 4?

20:29:29 >> Councilmember Cox: WELL, I THINK MY CONCERN WOULD BE, AS WE'RE MOVING IT 
20:29:33 AROUND, DOES THAT ALSO MEAN THAT SOME HIGH SCHOOLS THAT MIGHT BE IN ANOTHER 
20:29:42 DISTRICT WILL END UP BEING 22 IN ONE DISTRICT, BECAUSE YOU'RE TALKING IN 
20:29:49 TERMS OF THE THREE THAT'S PART OF THE -- I THINK IT'S CALLED MORE SUNDALE 
20:29:56 VERSUS SOUTH SUNDALE AVENUE, THAT THAT'S WHERE YOU WOULD HAVE KENNEDY 
20:29:56 HIGH SCHOOL.

20:30:14 AND I THINK --

20:30:16 >> Mayor Mei: WAS THERE AN OPTION TO OVERLAY?

20:30:21 I DON'T THINK WE HAVE THAT, I DON'T THINK IT'S ON THERE.

20:30:27 >> THERE'S SOMEONE AROUND LOGAN DRIVE, BETWEEN THAT AND BLACOW, AND I CAN'T 
20:30:28 SEE WHAT THAT OTHER STRAIGHT IS.

20:30:32  STREET IS.

20:30:41 YEAH, IT'S BLACOW.

20:30:47 >> Mayor Mei: SO IN ANY OF THE MAPS, WHICH DISTRICT IS IT IN?

20:30:50 I THINK IT'S IN 3 FOR ALL OF THEM, RIGHT?

20:31:01 >> SO THIS IS THE GREEN MAP WHERE IT IS IN 3, AND THEN IT IS ALSO IN 3 WITH 
20:31:02 91064.

20:31:07 >> I WAS GOING TO SAY.

20:31:17 OKAY.

20:31:22 >> Councilmember Cox: SO YOU'RE TRYING TO TAKE 91064 AND MAKE THE ADJUSTMENTS 
20:31:23 TO THAT ONE?

20:31:25 OR IS TO THE AGREEMENT?

20:31:28 I'M GETTING --

20:31:33 >> Mayor Mei: 51064, I THINK.

20:31:39 BECAUSE WE WERE TRYING TO CREATE MORE COMPACTNESS WITH DISTRICT 4 WHILE 
20:31:42 KEEPING IN THE CONCERNS FOR THE CENTERVILLE AND I THINK THAT WAS VICE 
20:31:45 MAYOR SALWAN THAT PROPOSED THAT.

20:31:47 COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN.

20:31:52 >> Councilmember Cox: I'M NOT REALLY MUCH FOR CHANGING IT TOO DRASTICALLY.

20:31:56 >> Councilmember Kassan: YEAH, I THINK ADDING NILES TO DISTRICT 3 DOESN'T 
20:32:02 SOUND LIKE A GREAT IDEA TO ME BECAUSE THAT IS A PRETTY BIG CHANGE, AND 
20:32:07 DISTRICT 3 ALREADY HAS A PRETTY -- IT'S PRETTY DENSELY POPULATED AND NILES IS 
20:32:14 REALLY ITS OWN NEIGHBORHOOD, INCREDIBLY SEPARATE FROM WHAT'S IN DISTRICT 3 
20:32:14 NOW.

20:32:18 I THINK THAT WOULD BE A LITTLE TRAIT TO PUT THOSE IN THE SAME DISTRICT.

20:32:25 >> IN TERMS OF COMPACTNESS, YOU WOULD BE RUNNING INTO THE SAME PROBLEM THE 
20:32:26 WAY I SEE IT.

20:32:30 BY MAKING DISTRICT 4 COMPACT, YOU WOULD BE MAKING  DISTRICT 3 LESS COMPACT.

20:32:40 AND AS I UNDERSTOOD, IT WAS A SUGGESTION TO MAKE CHANGES TO THE 
20:32:47 GREEN MAP, KEEPING  DISTRICT 2 THE WAY -- ON THE GREEN MAP, AND THEN 
20:32:50 EXTENDING DISTRICT 3 INTO THE NILES DISTRICT.

20:32:55 THUS MAKING DISTRICT 4 FOR COMPACT.

20:32:57 SO AGAIN, IT'S ALL TRADEOFFS.

20:33:03 >> Mayor Mei: BECAUSE DISTRICT 4 IS ODDLY SHAPED RIGHT NOW THE WAY IT IS 
20:33:05 ON THIS NEW MAP.

20:33:06 COUNCILMEMBER SHAO AGAIN.

20:33:12 >> Councilmember Shao: THANK  YOU, MADAME MAYOR, AND ALSO THANK YOU, 
20:33:14 COUNCILMEMBER COX, FOR BRINGING UP THE HIGH  SCHOOLS.

20:33:25 IN THE GREEN MAP, RIGHT NOW DISTRICT 4 HAS TWO DELTA 5 HIGH SCHOOLS, NAMELY 
20:33:27 AMERICAN HIGH AND MISSION HIGH.

20:33:30 >> Mayor Mei: AND THAT'S PRETTY ODD BECAUSE THEY'RE THE POLAR ENDS A 
20:33:36 LITTLE BIT ON THAT SIDE, BUT -- ON MISSION BOULEVARD.

20:33:47 BECAUSE IDEALLY, AMERICAN HIGH WOULD BE WITH DISTRICT 1, WHICH MOSTLY HAS -- 
20:33:47 OKAY.

20:33:48 VICE MAYOR SALWAN.

20:33:59 >> JUST TO CLARIFY, IT WAS THE REVISED GREEN MAP, AND I LOOK AT IT CONNECTING 
20:34:10 CABRILLO WITH NILES IS NO DIFFERENT THAN CONNECTING LIKE YOU SAID, IT'S 
20:34:11 TRADEOFFS.

20:34:24 I'M LOOKING FOR SOME CROW MIEZ, THE MAPS WORK, THEY'RE WITHIN THE 10% 
20:34:32 DEVIATION, WE DON'T HAVE LAWSUITS, AND THE MAJORITY CAN LIVE WITH IT.

20:34:33 THAT'S HOW I'M LOOKING AT IT.

20:34:36 >> Mayor Mei: WHEN WE MADE THAT ORIGINAL CHANGE, WHEN WE FIRST PUT 
20:34:40 THIS TOGETHER, WE THOUGHT, WELL, IT GIVES US TWO, THREE YEARS TO LOOK AT 
20:34:42 THIS, SO IT GOES BY FAST.

20:34:50 >> Vice Mayor Salwan: I WASN'T SURE HOW THIS AFFECTS TIME LINES OR WHEN THIS 
20:34:53 COULD BE BROUGHT BACK, DO WE NEED A SPECIAL MEETING, DO WE HAVE ENOUGH 
20:34:54 TIME, ALL THOSE SORT OF THINGS.

20:34:55 THANK YOU.

20:35:04 >> Mayor Mei: COUNCILMEMBER JONES, AND THEN WE'LL HAVE STAFF OR CONSULTANTS 
20:35:05 ANSWER US ON  THAT.

20:35:09 >> Councilmember Jones: OKAY.

20:35:14 I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW --  WELL, PROBABLY NOT OFF THE TOP OF YOUR HEAD 
20:35:21 BECAUSE THERE'S ABOUT 15 MAPS HERE, BUT THERE WAS A CHANGE, COUNCILMEMBER 
20:35:29 SOMEHOW HAS MISSION HSIEH AND -- IT USED TO BE WASHINGTON AND AMERICAN 
20:35:32 WERE IN THE SAME ATTENDANCE AREA WHICH KIND OF MADE MORE SENSE, IT KIND OF 
20:35:35 KEPT THAT NORTHERN SECTION OF THE CITY TOGETHER.

20:35:39 I DON'T KNOW IF THE TRADEOFF BETWEEN STRAIGHTENING OUT THE LINE BETWEEN 
20:35:45 FREMONT AND MOWRY MATCHES THE TRADEOFF OF AT THE VERY NORTH END OF DISTRICT 2 
20:35:51 AND DISTRICT 4, THE POPULATION BETWEEN FREMONT AND PASEO, BECAUSE ESSENTIALLY 
20:35:56 EAST OF PASEO, IT'S ALL OPEN LAND, THERE'S NOT ANY POPULATION  THERE.

20:36:02 BUT FOR INSTANCE, THE BOOK VEIL NEIGHBORHOOD AND ALL THAT, BETWEEN 
20:36:08 PASEO AND FREMONT, IS THAT THE TRADEOFF THAT COMES WITH ANDING IN THE 
20:36:14 STRUCTURE ON THE CORNER BETWEEN MOWRY AND FREMONT?

20:36:22 >> SO ARE YOU -- YOU'RE ASKING THE QUESTION OF WHEN WE ARE BRINGING THIS 
20:36:30 TO PASEO PADRE AND MOWRY, IS THE TRADEOFF THAT WE HAVE TO GIVE UP THIS 
20:36:30 AREA?

20:36:36 >> Councilmember Jones: SO ESSENTIALLY ONE OF THE GOALS WAS TO STRAIGHTEN OUT 
20:36:38 THE LINE ON MOWRY.

20:36:43 THE GREEN MAP ENCOMPASSES THAT, BUT IT LOSES THE NEIGHBORHOOD NORTH OF 
20:36:50 THORNTON BETWEEN PASSEO AND FREMONT, AND I'M JUST  WONDERING IF -- 
20:36:54 POPULATION WISE IF THOSE ARE SIMILAR NUMBERS, IF THAT IS WHY THAT TRADEOFF 
20:36:58 WAS MADE, EAST OF PASEO THERE'S NOBODY THERE, IN THE MISSION LAKES 
20:36:58 NEIGHBORHOOD.

20:37:10 >> SO WE ARE STILL ENEXANSING FROM THORNTON BETWEEN FREMONT AND PASEO HERE.

20:37:16 IN THE REVISED GREEN MAP.

20:37:22 >> Councilmember Jones: CAN YOU MOVE THE MAP DOWN A LITTLE BIT?

20:37:22 >> OF COURSE.

20:37:26 AND KEEP IN MIND THAT THIS BLUE LINE IS THE CURRENT DISTRICTS.

20:37:33 THEY'RE JUST THERE FOR  REFERENCE, SO YOU CAN SEE THE CHANGES.

20:37:38 BUT WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS THIS BLUE SHADED AREA AS DISTRICT 2.

20:37:39 >> Councilmember Jones: RIGHT.

20:37:45 WHAT I'M REFERRING TO IS ACTUALLY NORTH OF THAT, SO NORTH OF THORNTON BETWEEN 
20:37:49 PASEO AND FREMONT WAS FORMERLY DISTRICT 2.

20:37:57 SO ANYTHING ACROSS FROM QUARRY LAKES ESSENTIALLY.

20:38:04 SO I WAS CURIOUS IF THE POPULATION IN THAT PARTICULAR SECTION OFFSETS THE 
20:38:07 POPULATION CHANGE BY STRAIGHTENING OUT THE LINE ON MOWRY.

20:38:14 DOES THAT MAKE SENSE?

20:38:16 >> SO YES.

20:38:17 YES.

20:38:20 AND THAT IS EXACTLY RIGHT.

20:38:22 >> Councilmember Jones: OKAY.

20:38:24 SO THAT'S WHY THAT CHANGE WAS MADE.

20:38:25 >> I UNDERSTAND NOW.

20:38:25 YEAH.

20:38:26 AND YOU'RE EXACTLY RIGHT.

20:38:31 THAT IS A POPULATION -- SIGNIFICANT POPULATION AREA.

20:38:32 >> Councilmember Jones: OKAY.

20:38:32 THANK YOU.

20:38:42 >> Mayor Mei: SO I'M GOING TO ASK A FAVOR BECAUSE I THINK WE'RE DUE FOR A 
20:38:43 BREAK ANYWAYS.

20:38:46 WHAT I'M GOING TO SUGGEST IS THAT WE TAKE A QUICK 10-MINUTE BREAK SO WE 
20:38:52 RESUME TO THIS AND WE TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF TIME TO ADJUST AND WE NEED TO MAKE 
20:38:53 A STENO BREAK.

20:38:59 ALSO, I WAS GOING TO SAY, WHEN IT COMES BACK, I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW FROM THE 
20:39:05 CONSULTANTS THE TIMING, AND FROM STAFF, IF WE NEED TO -- CAN WE GET BACK FOR 
20:39:07 THE NEXT MEETING IF WE HAVE TO HAVE A FIFTH HEARING.

20:39:10 THAT'S WHY -- THE VERY REASON WE MOVED THIS UP TO BEGIN WITH, IF I RECALL, IS 
20:39:15 BECAUSE WE THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE THIS CASE BECAUSE IT WAS ORIGINALLY GOING 
20:39:20 TO BE, WE HAD ALREADY ANTICIPATED THIS, KNOWING OUR INTEREST.

20:39:24 SO LET'S TAKE A QUICK 10-MINUTE BREAK, AND THEN RETURN, BECAUSE WE NEED A 
20:39:29 BREAK FOR OUR STENOCAPTIONER, THAT WILL GIVE US ALL A TIME TO DIGEST AND US TO 
20:39:30 GET OUR MAGNIFYING GLASS OUT.

20:39:31 SO THANK YOU.

20:39:38 IF CAN YOU MUTE YOUR MICS AND STOP YOUR VIDEO, THAT WOULD BE GREAT.

20:39:38 THANK YOU.

20:39:43 [BREAK]

20:54:10 

20:54:11 THANK YOU MADAM MAYOR.

20:54:13 I'M GOING TO TRY TO MAKE YOUR 

20:54:15 JOB A LITTLE BIT EASIER THIS 

20:54:16 EVENING.

20:54:19 I KNOW WE'RE UP GENETICS A TIME 

20:54:21 CRUNCH RIGHT HERE AND IT'S 

20:54:22 REALLY, REALLY DIFFICULT TO LOOK 

20:54:23 AT THESE MAPS.

20:54:25 I'VE GOT THREE SCREENS GOING AND 

20:54:26 I'M STILL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT 

20:54:27 WHERE ALL THE LINES ARE.

20:54:29 BUT IN LOOKING AT THEM BOTH OF 

20:54:32 THEM ACTUALLY ACCOMPLISH WHAT WE 

20:54:33 KIND OF SET OUT TO DO IN THE 

20:54:37 LAST MEETING AND THAT WAS UNIFY 

20:54:39 THE NEIGHBORHOOD, UNIFY THE 

20:54:41 BUSINESS DISTRICT, UNIFY THE 

20:54:43 AFGHAN COMMUNITY.

20:54:45 SO YOU KNOW BOTH OF THOSE 

20:54:47 ACCOMPLISH THAT AND IT SIEMS 

20:54:50  SEEMS 

20:54:53 LIKE FROM THE MAJORITY OF THE 

20:54:57 COMMENTS 91064 IF I HAVE THAT 

20:54:58 NUMBERED RIGHT, THE MAJORITY OF 

20:55:01 THE COUNCIL IF I'M FINE WITH 

20:55:02 GOING WITH THAT AND IF THAT GETS 

20:55:04 US TO A RESOLUTION TONIGHT SO 

20:55:06 THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO EITHER 

20:55:07 SCHEDULE A PUBLIC MEETING, 

20:55:09 ANOTHER PUBLIC MEETING OR REDRAW 

20:55:16 AGAIN, THIS IS A VERY CONVOLUTED 

20:55:16 PROCESS.

20:55:19 THIS IS NOT SOMETHING ANYBODY 

20:55:21 WANTED TO BEGIN WITH, IT WAS 

20:55:24 KIND OF FORCED ON US BUT WE ARE 

20:55:25 WHERE WE ARE.

20:55:27 IN THE INTEREST OF TIME MOVING 

20:55:30 FORWARD TO BEAT THAT DEADLINE 

20:55:31 I'M HAPPY TO GO WITH THE 

20:55:32 MAJORITY OF THE COUNCIL.

20:55:33 THANK YOU.

20:55:34 >> AND JUST TO CLARIFY.

20:55:36 WE WOULD ONLY NEED TO HOLD AND 

20:55:37 ADDITIONAL MEETING IF WE WERE 

20:55:40 MAKING SIGNIFICANT CHANGES OR 

20:55:42 TRYING TO CREATE AN ENTIRELY NEW 

20:55:44 MAP.

20:55:46 IF YOU WANTED TO MOVE FORWARD 

20:55:49 WHERE 91064, BUT MAKE THE 

20:55:54 CHANGES WE DISCUSSED TO THE 

20:55:58 SUNDALE NEIGHBORHOOD IF THAT IS 

20:55:59 SOMETHING THAT CAN HAPPEN AND BE 

20:56:02 POSTED PUBLICLY AND BE ADOPTED 

20:56:04 ON APRIL 5th.

20:56:05 WITHOUT REQUIRING ANOTHER 

20:56:05 MEETING.

20:56:08 >> Mayor Mei:   OKAY, THANK YOU 

20:56:08 FOR THAT CLARIFICATION.

20:56:11 COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN.

20:56:13 >> Councilmember Kassan:   YES I 

20:56:15 WOULD ALSO REALLY SUPPORT MOVING 

20:56:16 FORWARD WITH ONE OF THESE TWO 

20:56:17 MAPS.

20:56:18 YOU KNOW, MAYBE WITH THAT MINOR 

20:56:20 CHANGE YOU JUST MENTIONED.

20:56:22 I FEEL LIKE WE WORKED PRETTY 

20:56:24 HARD TO GET TO THIS POINT AND 

20:56:26 STARTING ON AWHOLE DIFFERENT 

20:56:30 DIRECTION OF COMBINING NILES AND 

20:56:33  

20:56:39 SUNDALE, I WOULD AGREE WITH WHAT 

20:56:41 COUNCILMEMBER JONES JUST SAID.

20:56:42 >> Mayor Mei:   GOOD, 

20:56:44 COUNCILMEMBER KENG.

20:56:47 >> Councilmember Keng:   91064 

20:56:48 DOES MEET THE CRITERIA WHAT WE 

20:56:49 ARE TRYING TO MEET.

20:56:51 KEEPING THEM COMPACT, KEEPING 

20:56:53 THE NEIGHBORHOODS TOGETHER, AND 

20:56:55 SO I'M OKAY TO MOVE FORWARD WITH 

20:56:55 THAT.

20:57:05 >> Mayor Mei:   COUNCILMEMBER 

20:57:06 SHAO.

20:57:06 >> Councilmember Shao:   THANK 

20:57:07 YOU FOR UNDERSTANDING MY 

20:57:09 CONCERNS AND I'M SUPPORTIVE TO 

20:57:13 HIS SUGGESTION, IF WE CAN MAKE 

20:57:16 THE SUNDALE AREA A LITTLE 

20:57:19 SMOOTHER THAT'S ACTUALLY GOOD, 

20:57:23 EVEN BETTER THAN THE CURRENT, 

20:57:25 TOO, SO I'M SUPPORTIVE TO 

20:57:28 SLIGHTLY MODIFIED 91064.

20:57:31 >> Mayor Mei:   OKAY.

20:57:35 AND VICE MAYOR SALWAN.

20:57:36 >> Councilmember Salwan:   AS I 

20:57:38 SAID I WAS HAPPY WITH ALL THE 

20:57:41 MAMS SO IF WE HAVE CONSENSUS, 

20:57:42 THAT IS WHAT MAKES GOVERNMENT 

20:57:43 GREAT THAT WE CAN COME TOGETHER 

20:57:46 HAVE OUR DIFFERENCES AND COME TO 

20:57:48 A COMORN CONCLUSION, THAT'S 

20:57:50 REASONABLE, IT'S TEAMWORK AND 

20:57:51 WE'RE DOING IT TOGETHER.

20:57:52 SO COUNCILMEMBER JONES KIND OF 

20:57:53 BROUGHT THIS UP.

20:57:55 I THINK HE SHOULD BE THE ONE TO 

20:57:56 MAKE THE MOTION AND I'D BE HAPPY 

20:57:58 TO SECOND IT.

20:57:59 >> Mayor Mei:   OKAY 

20:58:00 COUNCILMEMBER JONES.

20:58:00 >> Councilmember Jones:   I 

20:58:01 WOULD BE HAPPY TO DO THAT.

20:58:04 I WOULD MOVE THAT WE GO FORWARD 

20:58:06 WITH MAP 91064.

20:58:07 AND I HOPE THAT'S THE RIGHT 

20:58:08 NUMBER.

20:58:10 >> Mayor Mei:   YES AND SECONDED 

20:58:15 BY VICE MAYOR SALWAN.

20:58:17 >> THAT'S THE NUMBER, HOW CAN 

20:58:20 ANY OF US FORGET IT.

20:58:24 >> MR. MAYOR IF I MAY JUST A 

20:58:26 REMINDER THAT THERE IS ALSO AN 

20:58:27 ORDINANCE INTRODUCTION AS PART 

20:58:28 OF THE RECOMMENDATION.

20:58:29 >> Mayor Mei:   THAT'S WHAT I 

20:58:31 WAS GOING TO SAY.

20:58:34 IT'S BEEN A WHILE, IF I RECALL, 

20:58:36 I WAS GOING TO TURN IT OVER TO 

20:58:38 READ AN ORDINANCE BEFORE WE DO 

20:58:39 THAT.

20:58:40 DO WE NEED TO READ THE ORDINANCE 

20:58:41 BEFORE?

20:58:43 >> NO AS PART OF YOUR CONSENT 

20:58:45 CALENDAR APPROVALS YOU WAIVE THE 

20:58:46 FIRST READING SO IT WOULD JUST 

20:58:48 BE AN INTRODUCTION OF THE 

20:58:51 ORDINANCE BY MAKING A MOTION TO 

20:58:52 INTRODUCE ORDINANCE AMENDING 

20:59:00 SECTIONS 2.05130 AND 2.1300 OF 

20:59:02 THE FREMONT CODE.

20:59:03 >> Mayor Mei:   WITH THAT 

20:59:06 INCLUSION, WE HAVE A MOTION BY 

20:59:07 COUNCILMEMBER JONES, SECOND BY 

20:59:08 VICE MAYOR SALWAN AND FIRST 

20:59:10 READING OF THE ORDINANCE 

20:59:10 AMENDMENTS.

20:59:11 SO ROLL CALL VOTE PLEASE.

20:59:17 >> YES, MADAM MAYOR.

20:59:28 COUNCILMEMBER KENG, AYE.

20:59:29 VICE MAYOR SALWAN.

20:59:30 AYE.

20:59:33 MAYOR MEI.

20:59:34 >> Mayor Mei:   AYE, THE MOTION 

20:59:37 PASSES UNANIMOUSLY, ALSO FOR 

20:59:40 LITTLE LINE FOR REVISION OF 

20:59:42 SUNDALE, SOMETHING ALREADY NOTED 

20:59:47 EARLIER, FOR THAT MINOR CHANGE, 

20:59:49 FOR COMPACTNESS AND 

20:59:49 COMPLETENESS, GREAT.

20:59:51 SO I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THEY 

20:59:54 CAN TELL ME, GO BACK TO --

20:59:55 >> MADAM MAYOR WE ARE GOING BACK 

20:59:58 TO 3B, THE PROCLAMATION FOR 

21:00:00 WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH.

21:00:01 >> Mayor Mei:   I WAS GOING TO 

21:00:03 SAY.

21:00:05 >> IT'S NOT NOTED ON YOUR MEMO 

21:00:11 YOUR SCRIPT, HOWEVER, FORMER 

21:00:12 COUNCILMEMBER NATARAJAN WAS 

21:00:14 INABILITY TO ATTEND THIS EVENING 

21:00:15 SO COUNCILMEMBER COX HAS SOME 

21:00:18 COMMENTS ON HER BEHALF.

21:00:20 AFTER YOU HAD READ THE 

21:00:21 PROCLAMATION.

21:00:22 >> Mayor Mei:   I'M GLAD SHE WAS 

21:00:24 ABLE TO READ HOPEFULLY HER 

21:00:26 STATEMENT THAT SHE SENT IN, 

21:00:27 THAT'S GREAT.

21:00:28 SO THIS IS THE PROCLAMATION FOR 

21:00:30 WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH TO

21:02:29 TOWNSHIP WOMEN WHO REALLY HELPED 

21:02:33 US START THIS WHOLE BALL ROLLING

21:02:41 FORMER COUNCILMEMBER ANU 

21:02:42 NATARAJAN COULDN'T MAKE IT THIS 

21:02:43 EVENING.

21:02:45 BUT I THINK YOU WANT TO SHARE 

21:02:46 SOME STATEMENTS OR COMMENT FROM 

21:02:48 THE FORMER COUNCILMEMBER AND WE 

21:02:50 ALSO WANT TO SAY THANK YOU.

21:02:51 THEY'RE NOT ON THE ZOOM, I DON'T 

21:02:53 THINK I'M CHECKING TONIGHT, I 

21:02:55 ALSO HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF 

21:02:57 SERVING WITH COUNCILMEMBER 

21:03:02 SUZANNE PHAN TO AT THAT TIME, 

21:03:05 AND I DON'T SEE ANY OF THE OTHER 

21:03:07 COUNCILWOMEN ON THERE.

21:03:08 JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE 

21:03:09 BEFOREHAND.

21:03:09 COUNCILMEMBER COX WOULD YOU LIKE 

21:03:12 TO SHARE SOME WORDS FROM FORMER 

21:03:15 COUNCILMEMBER ANU NATARAJAN?

21:03:16 >> Councilmember Cox:   YES, 

21:03:18 THANK YOU SO MUCH, MAYOR, FOR 

21:03:20 SHARING THE PROCLAMATION THAT I 

21:03:21 HAD SUBMITTED.

21:03:23 AND I THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT 

21:03:26 THAT WE PAY HOMAGE SINCE WE'RE 

21:03:29 AT A MILESTONE HERE.

21:03:32 AND UNFORTUNATELY, FORMER 

21:03:34 COUNCILMEMBER ANU NATARAJAN 

21:03:35 WASN'T ABLE TO MAKE IT AS WELL 

21:03:38 AS OUR FORMER SUZANNE CHAN.

21:03:41 BUT I KNOW THAT IN THEIR SPIRIT 

21:03:43 AND CARING OUT FREMONT THAT -- 

21:03:46 AND ALL THE OTHER WOMEN THAT ARE 

21:03:48 PHENOMENAL WOMEN ELECTED TO 

21:03:50 FREMONT CITY COUNCIL PAST AND 

21:03:51 PRESENT, THAT IT WOULD BE GREAT 

21:03:53 TO SEE A WORLD THAT IS FREE OF 

21:03:55 BIAS, STEREOTYPES AND 

21:03:56 DISCRIMINATION.

21:03:59 AND I KNOW THAT WITH ALL THE 

21:04:01 WORK OF THE PREVIOUS WOMEN THAT 

21:04:03 HAVE SERVED IN THESE SEATS, THEY 

21:04:06 HAVE WORKED VERY HARD, 

21:04:10 PERSEVERANCE, DETERMINATION TO 

21:04:11 GET ELECTED AND TO ALSO 

21:04:13 PARTICIPATE IN EVERY ASPECT OF 

21:04:14 THE CITY OF FREMONT'S 
LEADERSHIP.

21:04:17 AND AT THIS TIME, I WOULD LIKE 

21:04:20 TO CALL THEM ALL UNDER THE NAME 

21:04:30 OF WHAT MAYA ANGELOU WOULD SAY, 

21:04:31 THE PHENOMENALLY PHENOMENAL 

21:04:33 WOMEN AND STILL I RISE.

21:04:35 AND I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING 

21:04:37 THAT PAYS TRIBUTE THAT OVER 

21:04:39 TIME, THAT YOU MAY WRITE ME DOWN 

21:04:41 IN HISTORY, WITH YOUR BITTER 

21:04:44 TWISTED LIES, YOU MAY TROD ME IN 

21:04:46 VERY MUCH THE DIRT, BUT LIKE 

21:04:47 DUST, I STILL RISE.

21:04:50 YOU MAY SHOOT ME WITH YOUR 

21:04:50 WORDS.

21:04:53 YOU MAY CUT ME WITH YOUR EYES.

21:04:55 YOU MAY KILL ME WITH YOUR 

21:04:57 HATEFULNESS AND DISCRIMINATION, 

21:05:00 BUT STILL, LIKE AIR, I RISE.

21:05:05 I BRING THE GIFTS OF MY WOMEN 

21:05:07 ANCESTORS, THEY GAVE THEM TO US.

21:05:10 I AM THE DREAM AND THE HOPE OF 

21:05:12 EVERY WOMAN TO MOVE FORWARD.

21:05:13 BECAUSE I STILL RISE.

21:05:14 I STILL RISE.

21:05:17 AND SO, AS A RESULT, I WOULD 

21:05:22 LIKE TO NAME QUICKLY, THE 11 

21:05:24 TRAIL BLAZING WOMEN IN THE CITY 

21:05:26 OF FREMONT, THAT HAVE SERVED 

21:05:30 PAST AND PRESENT IN OUR HISTORY 

21:05:32 TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS 

21:05:45 CAPTURED, WINIFORD BINDLE, JANE 

21:05:51 STILLWELL, EVE LANE LIZELLE, 

21:05:58 JANELLE ZAGER, ANU NATARAJAN,

21:06:13 FREMONT THRIVING.

21:06:15 AND THE SPIRIT OF DIVERSITY, 

21:06:17 EQUITY, AND INCLUSION.

21:06:17 THANK YOU.

21:06:22 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

21:06:24 AND PLEASE GIVE OUR BEST, I 

21:06:28 THINK, TO ANU WHO COULDN'T JOIN 

21:06:29 US THIS EVENING AND CERTAINLY IT 

21:06:31 WAS A 35 YEAR PERIOD, IF YOU 

21:06:33 EVER WHEN WE REOPENED OUR CITY 

21:06:36 HALL HAVE A CHANCE, THERE IS ON 

21:06:38 OUR CITY WEBSITE A CHRONOLOGY OF 

21:06:39 THE ELECTIONS WHICH SHOWS ALL 

21:06:42 THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE COME AND 

21:06:46 SERVED, BOTH THE MALE, 

21:06:47 GENTLEMEN, COUNCILMEMBERS, AND 

21:06:49 ALSO ESPECIALLY THE WOMEN.

21:06:50 AND WE ARE FORTUNATE THAT SOME 

21:06:52 STILL ARE IN THE CITY AND WE GET 

21:06:54 TO SEE THEM AT DIFFERENT EVENTS.

21:06:56 AND SO I JUST WANTED TO 

21:06:59 ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE STILL GET TO 

21:07:01 SEE FORMER COUNCILMEMBER CHAN, 

21:07:03 AS SHE SERVES ON THE OHLONE 

21:07:07 TRUSTEES, AND THEN ALSO, 

21:07:09 COUNCILMEMBER NATARAJAN, FORMER 

21:07:10 COUNCILMEMBER NATARAJAN AS SHE 

21:07:15 WORKS NOW WITH META AND FORMER 

21:07:17 COUNCILMEMBER JUDY ZLATNIK WE 

21:07:19 SEE IN THE COMMUNITY AND IN 

21:07:19 NILES.

21:07:20 THANK YOU FOR THE SERVICE AND 

21:07:22 FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE 

21:07:24 THAT THIS EVENING.

21:07:25 THANK YOU, ON THE AGENDA THIS 

21:07:28 EVENING I WANTED TO GO BACK JUST 

21:07:30 TO BE SAFE, TO MAKE SURE IF 

21:07:31 ANYONE HAD ANY COMMENTS.

21:07:32 BECAUSE I KNOW THIS EVENING WAS 

21:07:33 A LITTLE BIT LONGER.

21:07:36 I'M JUST GOING TO JUST CHECK TO 

21:07:37 SEE THAT -- I'M GOING TO OPEN 

21:07:40 THE PUBLIC HEARING FOR ITEM 5B 

21:07:41 EVEN THOUGH WE ALREADY AGREED I 

21:07:43 THINK, I JUST WANTED TO SEE IF 

21:07:44 THERE'S ANYBODY HERE FOR THAT 

21:07:45 PUBLIC HEARING.

21:07:50 OKAY I'M OPENING --

21:07:52 >> AND THEN ALSO RAFAEL, DO YOU 

21:07:53 HAVE ANYTHING IN ADDITION TO ADD 

21:07:54 TO THAT?

21:07:57 >> THANK YOU, NO, THIS IS A 

21:07:59 STATE LAW REQUIREMENT SO I THINK 

21:08:02 IT'S PRUDENT FOR THE COUNCIL TO 

21:08:04 JUST BRING THAT BACK, OPEN THE 

21:08:06 PUBLIC HEARING, SEE IF THERE ARE 

21:08:07 SPEAKERS AS THE MAYOR JUST DID 

21:08:08 AND IF THERE ISN'T YOU CAN CLOSE 

21:08:10 IT AND CONSIDER THE ITEM 

21:08:11 CONCLUDED.

21:08:12 BUT IT'S A PRUDENT STEP.

21:08:13 THANK YOU.

21:08:15 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

21:08:17 WE'RE HAPPY TO HAVE YOU JOIN US.

21:08:19 SO AND THEN I WILL CLOSE THE 

21:08:21 PUBLIC HEARING FOR ITEM 5B AND 

21:08:22 THEN WE'LL RETURN BACK TO ORAL 

21:08:23 COMMUNICATIONS.

21:08:25 WHICH ARE ITEMS THAT ARE NOT 

21:08:28 SCHEDULED ON THE AGENDA THIS 

21:08:28 EVENING.

21:08:30 AND I THINK WE HAD SEVERAL 

21:08:31 SPEAKERS ON THAT AND THANK YOU 

21:08:33 FOR THE INDULGENCE THIS EVENING 

21:08:35 TO MAKE SURE WE CAN COVER THAT.

21:08:37 I'D LIKE TO FIRST RECOGNIZE 

21:08:38 MARIA HUGHES.

21:08:40 WELCOME.

21:08:42 >> MY NAME IS MARIA HUGHES AND 

21:08:44 I'M A LONG TIME RESIDENT OF 

21:08:45 FREMONT CURRENTLY RESIDING IN 

21:08:46 NILES.

21:08:47 I KEEP HEARING HOW FREMONT 

21:08:51 SHOULD NOT PUT IN 156 UNITS OF 

21:08:54 AFFORDABLE HOUSING, IN THE 

21:08:56 REMODELED MOTEL 6 BECAUSE IT 

21:08:58 FUTS CHILDREN AND SENIORS AT 

21:08:58 RISK.

21:09:02 I AM NOT A CHILD BUT I AM A 

21:09:03 SENIOR CITIZEN.

21:09:07 I AM ALSO SURROUNDED BY HOMELESS 

21:09:09 ENCAMPMENTS WHERE I LIVE, YET I 

21:09:11 WALK MY DOG AROUND THE 

21:09:12 NEIGHBORHOOD AND WALK AND RUN 

21:09:15 AROUND THE CREEK TRAIL AND NOT 

21:09:17 ONCE HAVE I FELT UNSAFE FROM THE 

21:09:20 UNHOUSED PEOPLE I HAVE SEEN 

21:09:20 THERE.

21:09:25 BUT I HAVE FELT UNSAFE WITH THE 

21:09:26 MEALS COOKED OUTSIDE.

21:09:28 I WOULD FEEL SAFE IF THE 

21:09:30 HOMELESS PEOPLE AROUND ME COULD 

21:09:31 FIND AFFORDABLE HOUSING WHERE 

21:09:34 THEY COULD COOK THEIR MEALS AND 

21:09:35 TURN THEIR LIVES AROUND.

21:09:38 I THINK THEY WOULD FEEL SAFE 

21:09:38 TOO.

21:09:41 WINNING AN AWARD FROM PROJECT 

21:09:42 HOMEKEY WOULD BE A GREAT START 

21:09:43 TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN.

21:09:45 THE UNHOUSED IN OUR COMMUNITY 

21:09:46 ARE OUR FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS.

21:09:49 SOME HAVE MANY PROBLEMS, NEED 

21:09:52 HELP, SOME ARE WORKING POOR WHO 

21:09:54 COULD GET REHOUSED WITH A SMALL 

21:09:54 HELPING HAND.

21:09:57 SOME HAVE WORKED ALL THEIR LIVES 

21:09:59 BUT LOST THEIR JOBS AND THEIR 

21:10:00 HOMES DUE TO THE PANDEMIC 

21:10:01 THROUGH NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN.

21:10:03 BUT NO MATTER HOW THEY GOT THERE 

21:10:04 THEY ARE ALL PEOPLE AND THEY 

21:10:05 DESERVE OUR HELP AND OUR 

21:10:07 UNDERSTANDING AND NOT OUR SCORN 

21:10:09 AND NOT OUR FEAR.

21:10:10 I BELIEVE THE COUNCIL 

21:10:12 UNDERSTANDS THIS, AND I APPLAUD 

21:10:14 YOU FOR APPLYING FOR PROJECT 

21:10:17 HOMEKEY GRANT AND I LOOK FORWARD 

21:10:18 TO SEEING THE PROJECT TAKE SHAPE 

21:10:20 WHEN THE GRANT IS HOPEFULLY 

21:10:22 AWARDED LATER THIS MONTH.

21:10:22 THANK YOU.

21:10:27 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

21:10:28 >> MADAM MAYOR.

21:10:30 I APOLOGIZE FOR INTERRUPTING.

21:10:31 BUT I WANT TO CLARIFY.

21:10:33 DID YOU SAY HOW MANY MINUTES THE 

21:10:35 ORAL COMMUNICATIONS WAS TO BE 

21:10:37 THIS EVENING?

21:10:38 I MEAN WE STARTED THE CLOCK AT 

21:10:39 THREE MINUTES BUT I JUST WANTED 

21:10:40 TO CLARIFY.

21:10:41 >> Mayor Mei:   THAT'S FINE 

21:10:42 BECAUSE WE'RE LATER IN THE 

21:10:43 EVENING AND THERE ARE THREE 

21:10:45 SPEAKERS RIGHT NOW SO --

21:10:46 >> OKAY.

21:10:47 FINE.

21:10:48 ALL RIGHT THANK YOU.

21:10:49 >> Mayor Mei:   JANE.

21:10:57 >> I APPRECIATE THE LADY WHO 

21:10:58 SPOKE UP EARLIER.

21:11:01 I ACTUALLY DO BELIEVE THAT THERE 

21:11:03 ARE A LOT OF HOMELESS PEOPLE WHO 

21:11:04 NEED OUR HELP.

21:11:07 HOWEVER, IT IS NOT OKAY FOR THE 

21:11:10 COUNCIL TO DISMISS OUR SAFETY 

21:11:11 CONCERNS.

21:11:14 SO AT THE LAST MEETING, I WAS 

21:11:16 SHOCKED WHEN COUNCILMEMBER 

21:11:18 KASSAN CALLED MY PRESENTATION OF 

21:11:21 THE CRIME RATE OF 77% AMONG 

21:11:23 HOMELESS, FREMONT HOMELESS WAS 

21:11:23 MISINFORMATION.

21:11:26 AND CLAIMED THAT HOMELESS AND 

21:11:28 HOUSED RESIDENTS HAD SIMILAR 

21:11:29 CRIME RATES DESPITE THE FACT 

21:11:31 THAT THE DATA WAS FROM FREMONT 

21:11:32 PD.

21:11:35 AND I QUOTED WHERE IT WAS FROM.

21:11:38 AND SHE HAS NO SOLID DATA TO 

21:11:40 PROVE HER POINT.

21:11:41 AND THE OTHER COUNCILMEMBERS 

21:11:43 REFUSED TO BACK HER UP.

21:11:45 AND IN THE SAME REPORT, STATED 

21:11:49 THAT 25 OF THE TOTAL ASSAULT 

21:11:52 SUSPECTS IN 2019 WERE HOMELESS, 

21:11:55 SINCE THE HOMEKEY PROJECT 

21:11:57 ACCEPTS PER THE FAQ AND 

21:12:00 CONVERSATION WITH THE STEP-UP 

21:12:04 CEO HOMEKEY PROJECT WILL ACCEPT 

21:12:06 PAST CRIMINALS, MENTALLY ILL, 

21:12:09 AND DRUG ABUSERS, AND IT IS NOT 

21:12:11 MANDATORY TO GIVE THEM REHAB OR 

21:12:12 TREATMENT.

21:12:15 IT IS ONLY -- IT'S A 

21:12:15 RECOMMENDATION.

21:12:18 SO I DON'T BUY INTO THE RHETORIC 

21:12:20 THAT HOUSING ALONE WILL PREVENT 

21:12:22 THEM FROM HURTING OTHERS AROUND 

21:12:23 THEM.

21:12:25 I BELIEVE THEY NEED A MORE 

21:12:29 HOLISTIC APPROACH RATHER THAN 

21:12:33 JUST HAVING A NONPROFIT GROUP 

21:12:36 WHO RECOMMENDS THESE TREATMENTS.

21:12:39 SO WE CAN'T TRUST OUR ELECTED 

21:12:41 OFFICIALS TO MAKE FAIR AND 

21:12:43 LOGICAL DECISIONS ON OUR BEHALF 

21:12:45 WHEN THEY TEND TO RELY HEAVILY 

21:12:48 ON PERSONAL BIASES AND LABEL THE 

21:12:49 FACTS AS MISINFORMATION.

21:12:51 SO I REALLY HOPE THAT THE CITY 

21:12:54 CAN RECONSIDER THE APPLICATION 

21:12:57 AND CONSIDER OUR VOICES, RATHER 

21:12:59 THAN DISMISSING OUR SAFETY 

21:12:59 CONCERNS.

21:13:03 I THINK WE WOULD REALLY 

21:13:05 APPRECIATE A CONVERSATION WITH 

21:13:08 YOU ELECTED OFFICIALS TO EXPRESS 

21:13:11 OUR CONCERN BASED ON THE DATA 

21:13:13 THAT WE SEE.

21:13:14 THERE'S JUST BEEN A LOT OF 

21:13:16 TRAUMA IN OUR COMMUNITY ALREADY.

21:13:18 WE'RE EXPERIENCING CRIME ALL 

21:13:20 OVER THE PLACE, EVERY SINGLE 

21:13:20 DAY.

21:13:23 AND WE SEE ALL THESE NATIONAL 

21:13:25 NEWS OF A LOT OF ASIAN AMERICANS 

21:13:30 ATTACKED BY SERIOUSLY MENTALLY 

21:13:31 ILL PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT BEING 

21:13:32 TREATED.

21:13:33 AND THIS IS WHERE OUR CONCERN 

21:13:34 COMES FROM.

21:13:38 I JUST HOPE THAT THE ELECTED 

21:13:41 OFFICIALS CAN ADDRESS OUR 

21:13:42 CONCERNS RATHER THAN DISMISSING 

21:13:47 IT AND LABELING US AS 

21:13:47 MISINFORMATION SPREADERS.

21:13:49 SO I HOPE CAN YOU RESTORE SOME 

21:13:52 OF THAT TRUST BY ADDRESSING OUR 

21:13:52 CONCERNS.

21:13:53 THANK YOU.

21:13:57 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU, THE 

21:13:58 NEXT SPEAKER IS JANE.

21:14:00 I'LL HAVE SOME COMMENTS ON SOME 

21:14:01 OF THIS LATER, JUST REAM 

21:14:02 QUICKLY.

21:14:04 I WILL ADDRESS SOMETHING REAL 

21:14:05 BRIEFLY.

21:14:06 JANE.

21:14:10 I'M SORRY, NEXT SPEAKER WAS LISA 

21:14:14 DANS I THINK OR FANG.

21:14:15 I AM TRYING TO REMEMBER I WANT 

21:14:18 TO KNOW WHO IS UNMUTED NOW.

21:14:19 >> THANK YOU.

21:14:22 MY NAME IS LISA AND I LIVE IN 

21:14:25 DISTRICT 3 IN THE SUNDALE 

21:14:27 NEIGHBORHOOD SO BASED ON THE 

21:14:28 PREVIOUS DISCUSS, I'M NOT SURE 

21:14:30 WHAT IT'S GOING TO BE CALLED 

21:14:32 NEXT YEAR BUT NOW I'M IN 

21:14:32 DISTRICT 3.

21:14:34 I WANT TO THANK THE COUNCIL FOR 

21:14:37 YOUR UNANIMOUS SUPPORT TO APPLY 

21:14:39 FOR FUNDING FOR PROJECT HOMEKEY.

21:14:43 I SINCERELY HOPE WE WIN THE 

21:14:44 PROJECT AND ARE ABLE TO EXECUTE 

21:14:45 ON THIS PROJECT.

21:14:46 I WANTED TO APPLAUD EVERYTHING 

21:14:48 THAT MARIA JUST SAID TALKING 

21:14:50 ABOUT HOW THE UNHOUSED COMMUNITY 

21:14:52 IS OUR THAIBS AND WE WILL ALL BE 

21:14:54 SAFER BOTH INCLUDING THE 

21:14:55 UNHOUSED COMMUNITY AS WELL AS 

21:14:56 THE HOUSED COMMUNITY IF PEOPLE 

21:14:59 HAVE MORE ACCESS TO HOUSING.

21:15:00 BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY, 

21:15:02 HOMELESSNESS IS A LACK OF 

21:15:03 HOUSING AND WE KNOW THAT 

21:15:05 AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS A 

21:15:07 SOLUTION.

21:15:08 AND THAT WILL REALLY BRING UP 

21:15:09 THE WHOLE COMMUNITY.

21:15:11 AND I JUST WANT TO REMIND FOLKS 

21:15:14 LIKE I READ LAST TIME, THAT 

21:15:16 BASED ON THE PROJECT HOMEKEY 

21:15:19 FALK, THE FREMONT POLICE THAT 

21:15:21 THIS PROMPT WILL DECREASE CRIME 

21:15:23 IN THE IMMEDIATE AREA COMPARED 

21:15:24 TO THE CURRENT CRIME RATE.

21:15:26 AND THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SAY.

21:15:27 THANK YOU IT WILL THANKS FOR 

21:15:29 APPROVING THE PROJECT.

21:15:30 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

21:15:33 NEXT IS FANG.

21:15:33 WELCOME FANG.

21:15:37 >> HI, ACTUALLY, JEN HAS 

21:15:39 EXPRESSED MOST OF WHAT I WANT TO 

21:15:40 SAY BUT I JUST WANT TO ADD ONE 

21:15:42 POINT.

21:15:44 THAT JUST IN AN E-MAIL FOLLOWING 

21:15:49 LAST MEETING, MS. KASSAN SAID 

21:15:51 THAT ONLY 40% OF THE HOUSE 

21:15:53 ARRESTEES IN THE POLICE REPORT 

21:15:54  

21:15:56 LIVE IN FREMONT SO SHE WOULD 

21:15:57 ASSUME ONLY A MINORITY OF THE 

21:16:00 HOMELESS ARRESTEES FOR CRIME 

21:16:02 LIVED IN FREMONT AND SHE ALSO 

21:16:09 NI INSISTED THAT THE HOMELESS 

21:16:12 CSMS USING THE FREMONT PD DATA 

21:16:14 SO IF YOU ALSO ASSUME ONLY LIKE 

21:16:16 40% OF HOMELESS ARRESTEES LIVE 

21:16:18 IN FREMONT, THEN THE CRIME RATE 

21:16:20 FOR HOMELESS IS STILL SO HIGH AS 

21:16:23 30%, AND IN ORDER TO BRING THE 

21:16:25 HOMELESS CRIME RATE CLOSE TO 

21:16:27 THAT OF THE FREMONT RESIDENTS 

21:16:30 CRIME RATE OF 0.3% YOU WOULD 

21:16:33 HAVE TO ASSUME ONLY TWO OR THREE 

21:16:38 OUT OF THE TOTAL 470 HOMELESS 

21:16:39 ARRESTEES ACTUALLY LIVE IN 

21:16:40 FREMONT.

21:16:43 IT'S REALLY TAKE LIKE A STRONG 

21:16:45 PREJUDICE AGAINST THE LOCAL 

21:16:47 RESIDENTS AND SEVERE LACK OF 

21:16:50 COMMON SENSE TO MAKE SUCH AN 

21:16:50 ASSUMPTION.

21:16:53 THEREFORE I THINK IT WAS 

21:17:00 MS. KASSAN WHO SPREAD, AND MOST 

21:17:03 SUPPORTERS FOR THIS PROJECT WERE 

21:17:04 NOT WARM SPRINGS RESIDENTS.

21:17:07 SO IT'S EASY TO SAY IT'S NOT 

21:17:11 LIKE IF IT BRING OUT ANY SAFETY 

21:17:13 CONCERN ISSUES, IT'S OUR ISSUES, 

21:17:17 NOT THEIR ISSUES, OR CAN'T 

21:17:18 REALLY REPRESENT US.

21:17:21 SO I REALLY WOULD HOPE THE CITY 

21:17:23 COUNCIL CAN HAVE LIKE FAIR 

21:17:26 CONVERSATION WITH LOCAL 

21:17:28 RESIDENTS AND ADDRESS OUR SAFETY 

21:17:42 CONCERNS.

21:17:43 RM THANK YOU.

21:17:48 NEXT SPEAKER IS FAN LEI OR LAI.

21:17:52 >> HELLO, MY CITY COUNCIL 

21:17:55 MEMBERS AND RESIDENTS.

21:17:58 I'M CALLING TO EXPRESS MY STRONG 

21:17:59 OPPOSITION TO THE HOMEKEY 

21:18:01 PROJECT THAT IS EXTREMELY CLOSE 

21:18:03 TO WARM SPRINGS RESIDENTIAL AND 

21:18:04 SMALL BUSINESS AREA.

21:18:06 AS A WARM SPRINGS RESIDENT AND A 

21:18:08 PERSON WHO ACTUALLY TALKED TO 

21:18:11 THE SMART BUSINESS OWNERS IN THE 

21:18:14 NEARBY PLAZA I WANT TO SPEAK OUT 

21:18:16 LOUDLY THAT THE PROJECT IS NOT 

21:18:18 SUITABLE AT THE CURRENT 

21:18:18 LOCATIONS.

21:18:22 WE HEARD SOME BUSINESS OWNERS 

21:18:26 THAT THEY FELT SAFE, WITH 

21:18:27 ANOTHER SHELTER AROUND.

21:18:29 I WANT TO APPLAUD SOME OF THE 

21:18:31 BUSINESS OWNERS FOR INSTALLING 

21:18:33 SECURITY SYSTEM AT THE 

21:18:37  ENTRANCE 

21:18:39 OF THEIR GATES TO MAKE IT SAFER 

21:18:40 FOR THEIR CUSTOMERS.

21:18:42 BUT I WANT TO ASK A RELEVANT 

21:18:42 QUESTION.

21:18:45 WILL YOU FEEL THE SAME LEVEL OF 

21:18:48 SAFETY WHERE HOMELESS FOLKS 

21:18:49 ENTER YOUR OFFICE AND REST ON 

21:18:51 THE FLOOR WITHOUT BEING INVITED?

21:18:53 AND DO YOU LIVE NEARBY?

21:18:55 DO YOU LIKE A SECURITY SYSTEM AT 

21:18:58 HOME, TO FEEL -- TO HELP YOU TO 

21:19:00 FEEL SAFE?

21:19:02 THE SAME LEVEL OF SAFETY?

21:19:05 WHEN THIS KIND OF INSTANCE 

21:19:07 HAPPEN FREQUENTLY TO THE NEARBY 

21:19:09 BUSINESS DO WE SUGGEST ALL 

21:19:11 RESIDENTS AND GROCERY STORES TO 

21:19:13 INSTALL THE SAME LEVEL OF 

21:19:15 SECURITY SYSTEM JUST TO BE SAFE 

21:19:17 FOR OPERATION?

21:19:20 AND DOES THIS REALLY TELL 

21:19:21 SOMETHING?

21:19:24 I APPLAUD CITY'S EFFORT TO 

21:19:27 ADDRESS THE HOMELESS CRISIS WE 

21:19:31 ALL FACE BUT PLEASE DO YOUR DUE 

21:19:37 DILIGENCE AND LOCATIONS AND 

21:19:38 OTHER CITY RESIDENTS HAVE RAISED 

21:19:40 UP AND PLEASE GIVE A CHANCE TO 

21:19:42 THE WARM SPRINGS RESIDENTS TO 

21:19:43 EXPRESS THEIR CONCERNS AND 

21:19:46 ADDRESS THEIR SAFETY WORRIES.

21:19:48 WARM SPRINGS RESIDENTS WE DON'T 

21:19:49 EXPECT TO BE AND SHOULD NOT BE 

21:19:52 REPRESENTED BY SOME PEOPLE LIVE 

21:19:53 FAR AWAY FROM US.

21:19:54 THANK YOU.

21:20:00 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU, NEXT 

21:20:02 SPEAKER IS KATHERINE.

21:20:06 WELCOME.

21:20:08 >> HI, CAN YOU HEAR ME?

21:20:09 >> Mayor Mei:   YES.

21:20:10 >> ALL RIGHT.

21:20:12 SO I'M SURE MANY COUNCILMEMBERS 

21:20:16 REMEMBER, IN 2019, I SPOKE AND I 

21:20:19 WAS HOMELESS AT THE TIME.

21:20:22 AND SO I FIND IT VERY DISTURBING 

21:20:26 THAT SO MANY PEOPLE COME ON HERE 

21:20:32 AND MALIGN THE HOMELESS WITH 

21:20:34 STRANGE STATISTICAL INFORMATION 

21:20:35 TALKING ABOUT MENTAL ILLNESS AND 

21:20:38 CRIME RATES AND HOW DANGEROUS 

21:20:41 HOMELESS PEOPLE ARE.

21:20:45 AND I JUST CANNOT HELP BUT FEEL 

21:20:47 LIKE THIS IS A PERSONAL AFFRONT 

21:20:51 TO PEOPLE LIKE ME, WHO, THROUGH 

21:20:53 UNFORTUNATE CIRCUMSTANCES, ENDED 

21:20:57 UP UNHOUSED BECAUSE OF AGE AND 

21:20:57 DISABILITY.

21:21:06 AND I REALLY WANT TO COMMEND 

21:21:15 JENNY KASSAN FOR POINTING OUT 

21:21:16 70% STATISTIC AS BEING 

21:21:17 UNREASONABLE, BECAUSE WHEN I 

21:21:19 LOOKED AT THAT, IT APPEARED AS 

21:21:22 IF THEY WERE COMPARING ARREST 

21:21:24 RECORDS AGAINST ARREST RECORDS 

21:21:27 RATHER THAN ARREST RECORDS 

21:21:29 COMPARED TO THE ENTIRE HOMELESS 

21:21:30 POPULATION.

21:21:34 AND TO ME, THAT'S A SKEWED STAT.

21:21:36 AND THE -- I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO 

21:21:37 POINT OUT THAT THE WEBSITE THAT 

21:21:39 THEY KEEP GETTING THEIR 

21:21:43 INFORMATION FROM HAS THE 

21:21:45 OWNERSHIP HIDDEN, WHICH TO ME IS 

21:21:48 SUSPECT, AND THEY USE ANECDOTAL 

21:21:50 EVIDENCE RATHER THAN EMPIRICAL 

21:21:51 DATA.

21:21:56 AND TO ME, THAT IS NOT 

21:21:57 APPROPRIATE.

21:22:01 ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THESE 

21:22:03 PEOPLE KEEP MENTIONING IS THE 

21:22:05 CURRENT CRIME RATE AT THE MOTEL 

21:22:09 6, AND I JUST WANT TO TELL 

21:22:11 PEOPLE THAT BY HOUSING PEOPLE 

21:22:12 WITH PERMANENT HOUSING AND 

21:22:14 SUPPORT IN PLACE, ON THE 

21:22:18 PROPERTY, CRIME RATE THERE WILL 

21:22:19 ACTUALLY GO DOWN.

21:22:20 BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT 

21:22:22 SELECTED PEOPLE RATHER THAN JUST 

21:22:25 RANDOM PEOPLE BEING ALLOWED TO 

21:22:27 BE THERE.

21:22:30 AND WITH SUPPORT SERVICES, I 

21:22:34 JUST -- I DON'T SEE HOW THIS CAN 

21:22:36 POSSIBLY BE A PROBLEM.

21:22:41 AND I ALSO WAS THERE WHEN YOU 

21:22:46 GUYS WEREN'T OVER THE CHOICES OF 

21:22:49 LOCATIONS AND THIS WAS A VERY, 

21:22:50 VERY GOOD CHOICE.

21:22:51 AND I WAS IN DISAGREEMENT WITH 

21:22:52 THAT.

21:22:54 AND I CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THAT.

21:22:57 SO I JUST WANT TO CONTINUE TO 

21:23:01 SAY THANK YOU FOR DOING THE 

21:23:03 RESEARCH, FOR DOING YOUR DUE 

21:23:05 DILIGENCE, AND TRYING TO HELP 

21:23:08 THE HOMELESS BECOME HOUSED 

21:23:08 AGAIN.

21:23:08 THANK YOU.

21:23:16 >> Mayor Mei:   NEXT SPEAKER IS 

21:23:17 JOHN HINES.

21:23:18 WELCOME JOHN.

21:23:22 >> HELLO EVERYONE.

21:23:24 THIS TIME IT APPLIES TO BOTH THE 

21:23:26 HOMEKEY AND SAFE PARKING 

21:23:27 INITIATIVES.

21:23:29 IN 2019, THERE WERE LONG 

21:23:31 DISCUSSIONS HERE ABOUT LOCATIONS 

21:23:34 FOR THE NAVIGATION CENTER.

21:23:36 AND IN THOSE TALKS ONE SLOGAN 

21:23:38 THAT CAME UP AGAIN AND AGAIN 

21:23:40 WAS, GREAT IDEA, WRONG LOCATION.

21:23:44 IT WAS A CATCHY PHRASE BUT IT 

21:23:47 CAME WITH A BUILT-IN PROBLEM.

21:23:48 BECAUSE EVERYONE HAS THE SAME 

21:23:50 RIGHT TO MAKE THAT CLAIM.

21:23:52 AND IF EVERYBODY DOES MAKE IT, 

21:23:55 THEN NO LOCATION WORKS.

21:23:57 ONE WAY OF HANDLING THAT PROBLEM 

21:23:59 WOULD BE TO CHOOSE A SPOT WHERE 

21:24:01 WE THINK THERE WILL BE LESS PUSH 

21:24:02 BACK.

21:24:04 SCHEDULE A VOTE FOR A SLOW 

21:24:04 NIGHT.

21:24:05 MAYBE PASS THE WORD TO SOME 

21:24:08 SUPPORTIVE ACTIVISTS SO THEY CAN 

21:24:10 ALL SPEAK IN FAVOR AND MAKE IT 

21:24:11 LOOK LIKE A POPULAR CHOICE.

21:24:14 THAT IS, SLIP IT THROUGH.

21:24:16 BY NOW WE SHOULD KNOW THE DOWN 

21:24:17 SIDES OF THAT APPROACH.

21:24:19 PEOPLE GET UPSET AT BEING 

21:24:22 TREATED THAT WAY WITH ONE VIVID 

21:24:24 EXAMPLE BEING THAT ONE REALLY 

21:24:26 BAD MEETING BACK IN JULY OF 

21:24:27 2019.

21:24:28 THERE IS ANOTHER WAY OF HANDLING 

21:24:30 THIS PROBLEM THOUGH, AND THIS 

21:24:32 ONE GOES RIGHT BACK TO THAT 

21:24:34 SLOGAN THAT I STARTED WITH.

21:24:36 IF SOMETHING CAN BE A GREAT 

21:24:39 IDEA, BUT ONLY SO LONG AS IT'S 

21:24:41 DONE IN SOMEONE ELSE'S 

21:24:44 NEIGHBORHOOD, THEN MAYBE, JUST 

21:24:46 MAYBE, IT ISN'T SUCH A GREAT 

21:24:47 IDEA AFTER AURAL.

21:24:51  ALL.

21:24:51 THANK YOU.

21:24:55 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

21:24:58 NEXT SPEAKER IS LUCY.

21:25:01 >> HI, DEAR CITY COUNCIL, YEAH I 

21:25:06 WANT TO GIVE SOME COMMENT, 

21:25:07 PREVIOUSLY SOME PEOPLE MENTIONED 

21:25:09 THAT MANY HOMELESS CRIME RATE IS 

21:25:10 MISINFORMATION.

21:25:12 ACTUALLY THOSE NUMBERS ARE 

21:25:14 ACTUALLY FROM OFFICIAL FREMONT 

21:25:15 CITY DOCUMENT.

21:25:19 SO ONE THING ELSE IS FROM 

21:25:21 FREMONT POLICE 2019, REVIEW OF 

21:25:22 PRIORITY CRIMES.

21:25:27 IT GIVES HOW MANY PEOPLE -- IT 

21:25:30 GIVES HOW MANY PEOPLE ARRESTED 

21:25:31 IN 2019.

21:25:34 AND ANOTHER DOCUMENT IS FROM 

21:25:35 CITY OF FREMONT 2019, EVERYONE 

21:25:39 COUNTS HOMELESS POINT IN TIME 

21:25:41 SURVEY, THAT GIVES HOW MANY 

21:25:42 HOMELESS IN FREMONT.

21:25:44 SO IF YOU SAY THAT 

21:25:45 MISINFORMATION I THINK EVERYONE 

21:25:47 SHOULD GO BACK TO LOOK AT THE 

21:25:48 ORIGINAL CITY DOCUMENT.

21:25:52 SO AFTER CLAIM THAT HOMELESS 

21:25:55 WILL NOT LOCAL RESIDENTS FOLLOW 

21:25:57 UP E-MAIL SO THE CITY COUNCIL 

21:25:58 POINT OUT THAT ONE CITY COUNCIL 

21:26:02 POINT OUT THAT AT 60% OF THE 

21:26:06 HOUSED ARRESTEES DID NOT LIVE IN 

21:26:09 FREMONT SHE WOULD ASSUME ONLY A 

21:26:11 MINOR -- SORRY SHE WOULD ASSUME 

21:26:13 ONLY A MINORITY OF THE HOMELESS 

21:26:15 ARRESTED LIVE IN FREMONT.

21:26:18 THEREFORE, OUR CALCULATION OVER 

21:26:20 STATEMENTED THE HOMELESS CRIME 

21:26:22 RATE THIS DOESN'T MAKE MUCH 

21:26:22 SENSE.

21:26:26 IT IS HARD TO IMAGINE THAT 

21:26:27 HOMELESS WHO NORMALLY LIVES IN A 

21:26:30 DIFFERENT CITY WOULD WALK 

21:26:32 BECAUSE MOST OF THE TIME BECAUSE 

21:26:33 MANY OF THEM THEY DON'T HAVE A 

21:26:34 CAR.

21:26:36 SO YOU CANNOT IMAGINE THEY JUST 

21:26:38 WALK ALL THE WAY TO FREMONT JUST 

21:26:40 TO COMMIT CRIME AND GET 

21:26:41 ARRESTED.

21:26:44 IT WOULD BE MORE REASONABLE TO 

21:26:47 ASSUME HOMELESS TO STAY AROUND 

21:26:48 WHERE THEY LIVE.

21:26:50 SO THE CITY COUNCIL SHOULD HAVE 

21:27:01 CAREFUL EXAMINED THE DATA, 

21:27:02 INSTEAD OF MISINFORMATION IN 

21:27:03 PUBLIC.

21:27:05 I THINK WE DESERVE AN APOLOGY.

21:27:07 AND THE NEXT THING I WANT TO 

21:27:10 REFUTE, THERE WAS LAST CITY 

21:27:13 COUNCIL MEETING THERE WAS A 

21:27:14 PRESCHOOL OWNER, I THINK SHE 

21:27:17 MENTIONED THEY FEEL VERY SAFE 

21:27:19 AROUND THE HOMELESS SHELTER OR 

21:27:19 SOMETHING.

21:27:25 SO I WAS VERY INTERESTED, SO I 

21:27:30 WAS -- ACTUALLY I WENT TO THEIR 

21:27:32 PRESCHOOL A FEW WEEKS AGO AND I 

21:27:33 TOOK A PICTURE.

21:27:34 IT IS VERY INTERESTING.

21:27:36 AROUND THEIR WHOLE SCHOOL IT IS 

21:27:39 VERY SCHOOL, IT IS A FENCE, VERY 

21:27:41 HIGH VERY STABLE VERY STRONG A 

21:27:45 FENCE, IF YOU SAY NOBODY CAN SAY 

21:27:48 FROM OUTSIDE, IT'S EVEN HIGHER 

21:27:48 THAN ME.

21:27:50 IT'S VERY SECURE SO I DON'T KNOW 

21:27:53 WHEN THEY SAY THEY ARE VERY FEEL 

21:27:55 VERY SAFE AROUND THE HOMELESS 

21:27:57 SHELTER IS IF THEY BECAUSE OF 

21:27:59 THE FENCE OR BECAUSE I DON'T 

21:27:59 KNOW.

21:28:00 THANK YOU.

21:28:07 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

21:28:09 I'M GOING TO CLOSE THE PUBLIC 

21:28:10 COMMENT PERIOD.

21:28:13 I SEE COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN HAS 

21:28:20 HER HAND RAISED AND I ALSO KNOW 

21:28:26 CITY MANAGER SHACKELFORD 

21:28:28 COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, GO AHEAD.

21:28:28 >> Councilmember Kassan:   I 

21:28:32 WANT TO SAY, IN STATEMENTS ABOUT 

21:28:33 PUBLIC POLICY, IT'S VERY, VERY 

21:28:35 IMPORTANT TO ME, YOU'VE HEARD ME 

21:28:37 TALK ABOUT THIS IN OTHER 

21:28:39 CONTEXT, WHEN WE USE DATA TO 

21:28:41 TALK ABOUT, THAT WE'RE VERY 

21:28:42 CAREFUL THAT THAT DATA IS WHAT 

21:28:44 IT PURPORTS TO BE THAT IT'S 

21:28:45 ACCURATE THAT IT'S CORRECT AND 

21:28:47 THE DATA THAT WAS SHARED WITH US 

21:28:48 THAT SOME OF THE SPEAKERS ARE 

21:28:50 CLAIMING IS ACCURATE DATA THAT 

21:28:52 IT CAME FROM THE CITY, WAS 

21:28:54 COMPARING TWO VERY DIFFERENT 

21:28:56 SETS OF DATA THAT CANNOT BE 

21:28:58 COMPARED.

21:29:00 AND WE HONESTLY WE DON'T HAVE 

21:29:01 THIS DATA RIGHT NOW.

21:29:02 I HAVE ASKED THE POLICE 

21:29:04 DEPARTMENT FOR MORE INFORMATION 

21:29:07 ON DATA RELATED TO CRIMINALITY, 

21:29:09 HOMELESSNESS, ET CETERA.

21:29:10 BUT THE DATA THAT THESE SPEAKERS 

21:29:12 ARE BASING THEIR STATEMENTS ON 

21:29:14 IS ABSOLUTELY NOT AN ACCURATE 

21:29:18 DEPICTION OF WHAT'S HAPPENING.

21:29:20 ANYONE WHO WANTS TO E-MAIL ME 

21:29:22 AND I CAN SHARE THE DETAILS ON 

21:29:23 THAT, I'M HAPPY TO.

21:29:26 BUT I JUST WISH THAT -- AND THE 

21:29:28 PERSON WHO ORIGINALLY BROUGHT IT 

21:29:31 UP DID ACKNOWLEDGE THAT SHE HAD 

21:29:34 FLAWS IN HER ANALYSIS IN E-MAIL.

21:29:36 BUT I WANT THE PEOPLE TO KNOW 

21:29:39 THE ACTUAL DATA RELATED TO 

21:29:41 CRIMINALITY AND HOMELESSNESS AND 

21:29:42 THE POLICE DEPARTMENT IS WORKING 

21:29:43 TO GET SOME OF THAT DATA 

21:29:43 TOGETHER.

21:29:45 BUT IN THE MEANTIME PLEASE DON'T 

21:29:47 USE TWO SEPARATE DATA SETS THAT 

21:29:48 ARE MEASURING TWO COMPLETELY 

21:29:50 DIFFERENT THINGS THAT CANNOT 

21:29:52 BE -- ONE AS A NUMERATOR AND ONE 

21:29:58 AS A DENOMINATOR.

21:30:00 THEY ARE COMPLETELY, THOSE DATA 

21:30:02 SETS CANNOT BE USED TOGETHER.

21:30:02 THANK YOU SO MUCH.

21:30:05 >> AND I WOULD JUST CONCUR WITH 

21:30:07 COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN'S COMMENTS.

21:30:08 AND I'LL LEAVE IT AT THAT.

21:30:10 SHE SAID EVERYTHING THAT'S 

21:30:11 NEEDED TO BE SAID.

21:30:18 THANK YOU.

21:30:19 >> Mayor Mei:   I DISAGREE, I 

21:30:23 JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT 

21:30:24 PEOPLE KNEW.

21:30:25 AND ALSO WE ARE VERY INTERESTED 

21:30:27 AND I KNOW SOMEBODY ELSE MADE A 

21:30:30 COMMENT ABOUT GETTING PUBLIC 

21:30:32 AWARENESS, WE POST OUR AGENDAS.

21:30:35 WE ALSO HAVE -- YOU CAN SIGN UP 

21:30:36 FOR FREMONT CONNECTIONS.

21:30:38 WE HAVE MANY DIFFERENT RESOURCES 

21:30:39 THAT WE ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO BE 

21:30:40 INVOLVED WITH.

21:30:42 WE SEND OUT REGULAR NEWSLETTERS.

21:30:44 AND WE HOPE THAT THE PUBLIC IS 

21:30:45 ENGAGED.

21:30:47 THIS IS FOR A GRANT, AND WE WILL 

21:30:49 FIND OUT IN MARCH WHETHER OR NOT 

21:30:50 WE WERE AWARDED THE GRANT AND WE 

21:30:53 WILL ALSO AGAIN FOLLOW UP AND 

21:30:54 WE'VE ALREADY HAD COMMITMENT 

21:30:55 FROM THE DEVELOPERS THAT WERE 

21:30:58 PROPOSED FOR THE AFFORDABLE 

21:31:02 HOUSING TO LOOK AT OUTREACH IF 

21:31:05 THAT MEASURE PASSES IN TERMS OF 

21:31:06 GETTING THAT FUNDING.

21:31:09 SO SEEING THAT THE PUBLIC 

21:31:13 COMMENT IS CLOSED, AND I WOULD 

21:31:15 LIKE TO TRANSFER TO ORAL REPORTS 

21:31:21 ON AND MEETINGS AND EVENTS.

21:31:56 NAMES THAT I JUST WANT TO MAKE 

21:32:00 SURE ARE ACCURATELY REFLECTED IN
