[Captioner] 19:21:28

DIE AT THE TICS, I'M HAPPY TO BE


[Captioner] 19:21:32

[Captioner] 19:21:32
THE RIGHT THING FOR CALIFORNIA


[Captioner] 19:21:32
AND THE NATION.

I'M VERY PROUD REPRESENTATIVE OF


[Captioner] 19:21:39

AMERICA.


[Captioner] 19:21:48
I'M VERY HAPPY TO SAY THAT IN


[Captioner] 19:21:49
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA, WE ARE


[Captioner] 19:21:51
TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN


[Captioner] 19:21:52
GET THE LICENSURE AND I WANT TO


[Captioner] 19:21:54
MAKE SURE THAT THE CONSUMERS ARE


[Captioner] 19:21:56
AWARE THERE ARE PEOPLE OUT THERE


[Captioner] 19:21:58

[Captioner] 19:22:00
CALL THEMSELVES NUTRITIONISTS BY

[Captioner] 19:25:47

[Captioner] 19:25:59
MATTERS TO NO AVAIL FOR OVER A


[Captioner] 19:26:00
YEAR AND A HALF.


[Captioner] 19:26:03
IT'S BEEN 19 MONTHS OF TORMENT


[Captioner] 19:26:03

WE HAVE A CONSTITUTION, WE HAVE


[Captioner] 19:26:38

[Captioner] 19:26:41
WEARING CRIMINALS ARE ABUSING


[Captioner] 19:26:43
THE LAW AND THEIR POWER AND


[Captioner] 19:26:44
AUTHORITY TO JUST DESTROY US.


[Captioner] 19:26:49
MY FAMILY MEMBERS ARE SUFFERING,


[Captioner] 19:26:50
I'M SUFFERING, AND SOMETHING


[Captioner] 19:26:51
NEEDS TO BE DONE ABOUT IT.


[Captioner] 19:26:54

[Captioner] 19:26:55
RETALIATORY BECAUSE ME AND MY

[Captioner] 19:29:50
>> THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:29:52
I'M SPEAKING TO YOU TODAY ON


[Captioner] 19:29:54
BEHALF OF THE SUPPORTERS OF


[Captioner] 19:29:56
PARKS AND TRAILS IN AND AROUND
FREMONT.


[Captioner] 19:29:58
WE ARE DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT


[Captioner] 19:30:00
THE RECENT FACEBOOK POST FROM


[Captioner] 19:30:01
OUR CITY GOVERNMENT.


[Captioner] 19:30:04
THESE COMMUNICATIONS HAVE OFTEN


[Captioner] 19:30:07
BEEN UNCLEAR, CONFUSING, OR EVEN


[Captioner] 19:30:08
MISLEADING, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT


[Captioner] 19:30:09
COMES TO MISSION PEAK REGIONAL
PRESERVE.


[Captioner] 19:30:12
WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE LATEST


[Captioner] 19:30:14
FACEBOOK POST ABOUT THE PARK


[Captioner] 19:30:15
TALKS ABOUT PARKING


[Captioner] 19:30:17
RESTRICTIONS, BUT IT FAILS TO


[Captioner] 19:30:17
PROVIDE CLEAR INFORMATION.


[Captioner] 19:30:20
WHILE THIS POST MENTIONS THAT


[Captioner] 19:30:22
PARKING IS RESTRICTED, IT THEN


[Captioner] 19:30:24
GOES ON TO CLARIFY THAT A


[Captioner] 19:30:26
PARKING PERMIT IS ONLY REQUIRED


[Captioner] 19:30:27
ON WEEKENDS AND HOLIDAYS.


[Captioner] 19:30:29
WHAT THEY NEGLECT TO MENTION IS


[Captioner] 19:30:32
THAT THE CITY HAS, QUOTE,


[Captioner] 19:30:33
GENEROUSLY, UNQUOTE, ALLOWED 150


[Captioner] 19:30:35
FREE PARKING SPACES ON VINEYARD


[Captioner] 19:30:37
AND ANTELOPE DRIVE.


[Captioner] 19:30:39
SUCH DETAILS ARE CRUCIAL FOR


[Captioner] 19:30:40
VISITORS TO PLAN THEIR VISIT AND


[Captioner] 19:30:41
HAVE A SMOOTH EXPERIENCE.


[Captioner] 19:30:45
ADDITIONALLY, THE FACEBOOK POST


[Captioner] 19:30:47
DATED MARCH 17TH IMPLIES THAT


[Captioner] 19:30:49
ANYONE CAN GET A PERMIT FOR


[Captioner] 19:30:50
PARKING BUT FAILS TO MENTION


[Captioner] 19:30:53
THAT THIS PRIVILEGE IS ONLY


[Captioner] 19:30:55
EXTENDED TO LOCAL RESIDENTS, WHO


[Captioner] 19:30:58
ENJOY HOMES WITH A MEDIAN VALUE


[Captioner] 19:30:59
OF 2 1/2 MILLION THRARS.


[Captioner] 19:31:02
 DOLLARS.


[Captioner] 19:31:04
THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT DETAIL


[Captioner] 19:31:05
THAT THE CITY IS CONVENIENTLY
HIDING.


[Captioner] 19:31:07
IN CONCLUSION, WE URGE THE CITY


[Captioner] 19:31:09
COUNCIL TO PROVIDE MORE


[Captioner] 19:31:10
TRANSPARENT AND CLEAR


[Captioner] 19:31:12
COMMUNICATIONS TO VISITORS OF


[Captioner] 19:31:13
MISSION PEAK REGIONAL PRESERVE


[Captioner] 19:31:14

[Captioner] 19:37:25
HELLO?


[Captioner] 19:37:25
>> Ms. Gauthier: YES.


[Captioner] 19:37:26
>> HI THERE.


[Captioner] 19:37:26
YES.


[Captioner] 19:37:29
I HAVE LIVED IN FREMONT FOR


[Captioner] 19:37:29
MAYBE 22 YEARS.


[Captioner] 19:37:34
IN PATTERSON RANCH FOR ABOUT SIX


[Captioner] 19:37:37
YEARS, RIGHT, SO ALL IN ALL,


[Captioner] 19:37:41
THESE 15, 18 YEARS, THINGS


[Captioner] 19:37:43
HAVEN'T CHANGED, UNEVENTFUL,


[Captioner] 19:37:45
WHICH IS PRETTY GOOD.


[Captioner] 19:37:46
BORING IS FINE.


[Captioner] 19:37:48
I WOULD RATHER LIVE A BORING


[Captioner] 19:37:49
LIFE THAN THE KIND OF ACTION WE


[Captioner] 19:37:50
ARE GOING THROUGH RIGHT NOW.


[Captioner] 19:37:52
SO FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS OR


[Captioner] 19:37:54
SO, 2020, 21, YOU KNOW, REALLY


[Captioner] 19:37:56
TWO, THREE YEARS, RIGHT, SINCE


[Captioner] 19:37:59
CORONA AND ALL, THINGS


[Captioner] 19:38:01
DRAMATICALLY CHANGED FOR THE
WORSE.


[Captioner] 19:38:02
THERE'S A LOT OF ACTION.


[Captioner] 19:38:05
SO HERE IN PATTERSON RANCH AND


[Captioner] 19:38:07
IN THIS TIME FRAME, WE ARE


[Captioner] 19:38:12
TALKING ABOUT, YOU KNOW, BEFORE


[Captioner] 19:38:14
DOORSTEP STEALING, PEOPLE TAKING


[Captioner] 19:38:17
PACKAGES AWAY, TO BREAKING INTO


[Captioner] 19:38:20
CARS, TO JUST DRIVING DOWN IN


[Captioner] 19:38:22
THE BROAD DAYLIGHT, OVERNIGHT,


[Captioner] 19:38:27
LOOKING AT US, TO STEALING CARS
NOW.


[Captioner] 19:38:29
SO THINGS ARE GETTING


[Captioner] 19:38:29
INCREMENTALLY WORSE.


[Captioner] 19:38:33
AND THEN POLICE IS GETTING


[Captioner] 19:38:34
INCREMENTALLY WORSE TOO IN THEIR


[Captioner] 19:38:36
ACTION IN THEIR -- YOU KNOW,


[Captioner] 19:38:37
WHATEVER THEY CAN DO.


[Captioner] 19:38:38
THEY SEEM HELPLESS, YOU KNOW.


[Captioner] 19:38:42
I WOULD SAY THEY'RE MORE


[Captioner] 19:38:46
HELPLESS THAN -- IF THEY SHOW
UP.


[Captioner] 19:38:48
FOR EXAMPLE, THERE WAS A BREAK


[Captioner] 19:38:50
LN IN I REPORTED, THEY SHOWED


[Captioner] 19:38:52
UP, THEY WERE FACE-TO-FACE, BUT


[Captioner] 19:38:54
THEY DIDN'T MAKE AN ARREST.


[Captioner] 19:38:57
THEY DECIDED THEIR POLICY IS NOT


[Captioner] 19:38:58
TO CHASE BUT THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO
CHASE.


[Captioner] 19:39:00
SO THERE'S SO MUCH GOING ON, IT


[Captioner] 19:39:02
LOOKS LIKE POLICE IS NOT ABLE TO


[Captioner] 19:39:02
HELP MUCH.


[Captioner] 19:39:04
SO WHO IS GOING TO HELP US?


[Captioner] 19:39:06
ADMINISTRATORS, POLICY MAKERS,


[Captioner] 19:39:07
COURTS, JUDGES, D.A.s?


[Captioner] 19:39:09
WHO IS AT FAULT HERE?


[Captioner] 19:39:14
SO HERE OUR LIFE IS ALMOST HELL


[Captioner] 19:39:14
NOW, MAYBE.


[Captioner] 19:39:16
NEXT THING IS SOMEBODY WILL


[Captioner] 19:39:17
BREAK INTO OUR HOUSE.


[Captioner] 19:39:19
SO WHAT SHOULD WE DO, COUNT ON


[Captioner] 19:39:20
YOU, COUNT ON POLICE OR COUNT ON


[Captioner] 19:39:22
OURSELVES AND GO AND TAKE


[Captioner] 19:39:23
MATTERS INTO OUR OWN HANDS?


[Captioner] 19:39:23
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:39:27
>> Ms. Gauthier: THE NEXT


[Captioner] 19:39:28
SPEAKER IS ARUN.


[Captioner] 19:39:37
>> HELLO.


[Captioner] 19:39:42
HELLO, RESPECTED MAYOR, CITY


[Captioner] 19:39:44
COUNCILMEMBERS AND STAFF, I'M A


[Captioner] 19:39:46
RESIDENT OF FREMONT FOR OVER 20
YEARS.


[Captioner] 19:39:51
I'M ALSO A RESIDENT OF PATTERSON


[Captioner] 19:39:54
RANCH LIKE TAJINDER AHEAD OF
ME.


[Captioner] 19:39:57
THE LAST FEW YEARS FREMONT


[Captioner] 19:39:58
RESIDENTS HAVE BEEN INCREASING


[Captioner] 19:40:02
CRIME WHICH IS INCREMENTALLY
INCREASING.


[Captioner] 19:40:05
PROP 47 WHOSE INTENTIONS MIGHT


[Captioner] 19:40:08
BE NOBLE BULL PETTY CRIMES TO


[Captioner] 19:40:11
EARN A FAST BUCK AND WORKING


[Captioner] 19:40:14
HARD TO MAKE A SUSTAINED LIVING.


[Captioner] 19:40:17
 -- REMOVE THE CHECKS AND


[Captioner] 19:40:20
BALANCES AND A FOCUS ON


[Captioner] 19:40:21
WEAKENING THE LAW ENFORCEMENT
SYSTEM.


[Captioner] 19:40:26
AN EXAMPLE OF THIS IS WHAT IS


[Captioner] 19:40:27
PROPOSED FOR DISALLOWING


[Captioner] 19:40:28
BACKGROUND CHECK FOR RENTING.


[Captioner] 19:40:30
IN THE LAST MEETING.


[Captioner] 19:40:32
THIS IS CREATING AN ENVIRONMENT


[Captioner] 19:40:36
THAT REWARDS PETTY THEFT.


[Captioner] 19:40:39
IT HAS BECOME ROUTINE AND PEOPLE


[Captioner] 19:40:40
DON'T EVEN REPORT IT AS A
CRIME.


[Captioner] 19:40:44
AND THESE THIEVES LIKE HE SAID


[Captioner] 19:40:46
ARE BECOMING BORDERLINE


[Captioner] 19:40:49
ADVANCING IN THE CRIME -- IT


[Captioner] 19:40:51
MORE THAN THE DOLLAR LOSS, IT'S


[Captioner] 19:40:53
THE EMOTIONAL TOLL THAT'S FELT


[Captioner] 19:40:54
BY THE PEOPLE WHO ARE AFFECTED.


[Captioner] 19:40:58
THEY FEEL VIOLATED, THEIR


[Captioner] 19:41:00
PRIVACY INFRINGED, AND THE KIDS


[Captioner] 19:41:03
ARE NOT SECURE AND THIS AFFECTS


[Captioner] 19:41:05
THEIR MENTAL HEALTH, WHICH IS A


[Captioner] 19:41:05
BIG PROBLEM.


[Captioner] 19:41:13
SO LIKE THERE WAS THIS INCIDENT


[Captioner] 19:41:16
LIKE WHAT TAJINDER SAID, WHERE


[Captioner] 19:41:18
HE CALLED THE POLICE,


[Captioner] 19:41:19
UNFORTUNATELY THE POLICE WERE


[Captioner] 19:41:22
CALLED BUT NO ACTION WAS TAKEN,


[Captioner] 19:41:24
AND YOU SEE THE SAME CAR THE


[Captioner] 19:41:28
NEXT DAY LOOKING AT OTHER


[Captioner] 19:41:28
VEHICLES TO ROB.


[Captioner] 19:41:32
SO HOW DOES THIS -- THIS DOES


[Captioner] 19:41:33
NOT MAKE US FEEL SECURE.


[Captioner] 19:41:37
WE NEED TO CHANGE THIS, AND


[Captioner] 19:41:38
WE'RE LOOKING FOR THE CITY


[Captioner] 19:41:43
COUNCIL AND THE POLICE TO 


[Captioner] 19:41:44
TAKE --


[Captioner] 19:41:45
>> Ms. Gauthier: THE NEXT


[Captioner] 19:41:48
SPEAKER IS SAI NAGARAJAN.


[Captioner] 19:41:50
>> GOOD EVENING, RESPECTED CITY
COUNCIL.


[Captioner] 19:41:53
LOOK, OVER THE LAST YEAR, I HAD


[Captioner] 19:41:54
THE OPPORTUNITY TO MEET WITH


[Captioner] 19:41:57
FOUR OR FIVE OF THE FINEST


[Captioner] 19:41:58
OFFICERS OF THE FREMONT POLICE


[Captioner] 19:42:00
DEPARTMENT ON VARIOUS MATTERS,


[Captioner] 19:42:02
AND I ASKED THEM A VERY SIMPLE


[Captioner] 19:42:04
QUESTION, AND REGARDLESS OF WHAT


[Captioner] 19:42:05
THEIR RANK WAS, SERGEANT,


[Captioner] 19:42:07
CAPTAIN, ET CETERA, OR BEAT


[Captioner] 19:42:08
OFFICER, I WOULD ASK THEM, WOULD


[Captioner] 19:42:11
YOU FEEL SAFE IF YOU HAD A


[Captioner] 19:42:12
TEENAGE DAUGHTER AND IF SHE


[Captioner] 19:42:15
COULD WALK ALONE ON A CITY


[Captioner] 19:42:16
STREET IN FREMONT AFTER SUNSET?


[Captioner] 19:42:19
I KID YOU NOT, PUT ALL YOUR


[Captioner] 19:42:20
STATISTICS ASIDE AND ALL OF


[Captioner] 19:42:23
YOUR, YOU KNOW, MATHEMATICAL


[Captioner] 19:42:28
SHALL WE SAY FIG LEAFS ASIDE


[Captioner] 19:42:29
FOR A MOMENT, EVERY SINGLE ONE


[Captioner] 19:42:31
OF THESE OFFICERS NODDED THEIR


[Captioner] 19:42:33
HEADS EAST TO WEST, EAST TO


[Captioner] 19:42:35
WEST, BASICALLY INDICATING


[Captioner] 19:42:36
INSTINCTIVELY THAT THEY WOULD


[Captioner] 19:42:38
NOT FEEL SAFE HAVING THEIR CHILD


[Captioner] 19:42:40
WALK ALONE IN THE CITY OF


[Captioner] 19:42:42
FREMONT AFTER SUNSET.


[Captioner] 19:42:43
NOW, I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT


[Captioner] 19:42:44
MEANS FOR YOU, BUT I'LL TELL YOU


[Captioner] 19:42:47
FOR ME, AS AN INDIAN AMERICAN,


[Captioner] 19:42:49
AND A HINDU AMERICAN, WHEN I SIT


[Captioner] 19:42:51
HERE IN NORTH FREMONT, I FEEL
EXPOSED.


[Captioner] 19:42:55
I FEEL AFRAID BECAUSE WE KNOW


[Captioner] 19:42:57
THAT LAW AND ORDER HAS BROKEN
DOWN.


[Captioner] 19:42:59
EARLIER THIS WEEK THE CONSULATE


[Captioner] 19:43:00
GENERAL OF INDIA IN


[Captioner] 19:43:01
SAN FRANCISCO WAS ATTACKED BY


[Captioner] 19:43:03
PROTESTORS, I WOULD CALL THEM


[Captioner] 19:43:06
TERRORISTS, AND THE CAUSE THAT'S


[Captioner] 19:43:10
THESE TERRORISTS ARE SUPPORTING


[Captioner] 19:43:11
ARE KNOWN TO THE CITY OF
FREMONT.


[Captioner] 19:43:13
EVERY YEAR AT THE FESTIVAL OF


[Captioner] 19:43:16
THE GLOBE OF INDIA, THE FOG


[Captioner] 19:43:19
EVENT, WE SEE THESE SAME


[Captioner] 19:43:21
CHARACTERS ENGAGE IN HATEFUL


[Captioner] 19:43:23
BEHAVIOR, BORDERING ON
TERRORISM.


[Captioner] 19:43:27
THEY CREATE ABSOLUTE MAYHEM, AND


[Captioner] 19:43:29
CAUSE, YOU KNOW, THE FINE LINE


[Captioner] 19:43:31
BETWEEN FREE SPEECH AND HATE


[Captioner] 19:43:32
SPEECH, AND YET THE CITY OF


[Captioner] 19:43:32
FREMONT DOES ABSOLUTELY
NOTHING.


[Captioner] 19:43:35
SO WHAT I WOULD ASK YOU TONIGHT


[Captioner] 19:43:37
IS BEFORE YOU GO TO BED, YOU


[Captioner] 19:43:38
KNOW, HUG YOUR KIDS A LITTLE


[Captioner] 19:43:40
TIGHTER, IF YOU'VE GOT


[Captioner] 19:43:42
GRANDKIDS, HUG THEM A LITTLE


[Captioner] 19:43:43
TIGHTER BECAUSE WE KNOW IT NOT


[Captioner] 19:43:44
SAFE FOR THEM TO WALK AROUND IN


[Captioner] 19:43:45
FREMONT AFTER SUNSET.


[Captioner] 19:43:48
HOPE YOU ALL DO -- YOU'LL ALL DO


[Captioner] 19:43:48
SOMETHING ABOUT IT.

THANK YOU.

GOOD EVENING, MAYOR LILY MEI AND

WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH WAS

ESTABLISHED IN THE UNITED STATES


[Captioner] 19:45:03
IN 18 -- 1987 TO RECOGNIZE THE


[Captioner] 19:45:05
CONTRIBUTIONS AND ACHIEVEMENT OF

[Captioner] 19:45:09
AS WE CELEBRATE WOMEN'S HISTORY


[Captioner] 19:45:11
MONTH THIS MARCH, I WANT TO TAKE


[Captioner] 19:45:14
A MOMENT TO REFLECT ON THE


[Captioner] 19:45:16
INCREDIBLE STRIVES OUR CITY HAS


[Captioner] 19:45:20
MADE IN BREAKING DOWN GENDER AND


[Captioner] 19:45:21
RACIAL PARITY.


[Captioner] 19:45:23
FREMONT HAS ALWAYS BEEN A PLACE


[Captioner] 19:45:24
WHERE DIVERSITY IS CELEBRATED


[Captioner] 19:45:28
AND WE WORK TOGETHER TO CREATE


[Captioner] 19:45:30
MORE EQUITABLE AND INCLUSIVE
COMMUNITY.


[Captioner] 19:45:33
THROUGHOUT OUR CITY'S HISTORY


[Captioner] 19:45:34
HAS SEEN WOMEN AND PEOPLE OF


[Captioner] 19:45:36
COLOR BREAK DOWN THE BARRIERS


[Captioner] 19:45:44
AND SHATTERS THE GLASS CEILING.


[Captioner] 19:45:50
MAYOR LILY MEI MADE HISTORY


[Captioner] 19:45:52
HERSELF AS THE FIRST ASIAN


[Captioner] 19:45:53
AMERICAN MAYOR OF THE CITY.


[Captioner] 19:45:56
I ALSO WANT TO -- TERESA KENG


[Captioner] 19:45:58
WHO HAS SERVED AS VICE MAYOR OF


[Captioner] 19:45:59

>> HI.


[Captioner] 19:47:22
THIS IS -- I'M A RESIDENT, I'M


[Captioner] 19:47:23
GOING TO GET STRAIGHT TO THE
POINT.


[Captioner] 19:47:25
SO ABOUT THE CRIME RATES,
RIGHT?


[Captioner] 19:47:29
I KEEP A LOG OF THE CRIME AND


[Captioner] 19:47:32
SINCE JANUARY 2023, WE ALREADY


[Captioner] 19:47:35
HAVE MORE THAN 30 THEFTS, OKAY,


[Captioner] 19:47:37
30 INCIDENTS INCLUDING


[Captioner] 19:47:37
SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITIES.


[Captioner] 19:47:40
SO I'LL BREAK DOWN THE STATS FOR
YOU.


[Captioner] 19:47:42
JUST BY THEFT AND BURGLARY


[Captioner] 19:47:45
ALONE, THERE WERE AT LEAST 16


[Captioner] 19:47:47
CASES, AND IN A BREAK-IN HOME


[Captioner] 19:47:49
INVASION, THERE ARE THREE OF
THEM.


[Captioner] 19:47:51
ONE OF THEM INCLUDING
SQUATTING.


[Captioner] 19:47:53
I'M APPRECIATING ALL OF THE FPD


[Captioner] 19:47:56
QUICK RESPONSE THIS ARRESTING


[Captioner] 19:47:58
THE GUY WHO SQUATTED IN ONE OF


[Captioner] 19:47:59
THE UNITS, OKAY.


[Captioner] 19:48:01
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, BUT I KNOW


[Captioner] 19:48:02
THAT FPD IS SHORT ON STAFF.


[Captioner] 19:48:05
IS THERE ANY WAY THAT YOU GUYS


[Captioner] 19:48:07
CAN PROVIDE MORE BUDGET TO


[Captioner] 19:48:09
ENFORCE -- TO INCREASE THE


[Captioner] 19:48:11
POLICE FORCE, AS WELL AS RECOVER


[Captioner] 19:48:15
AND FIX YOUR DAMN LAWS TO REALLY


[Captioner] 19:48:16
ALLOW THE POLICE TO DO THEIR
JOB.


[Captioner] 19:48:17
THE REASON IS I KNOW THAT SOME


[Captioner] 19:48:19
OF THE POLICE OFFICERS, SOME OF


[Captioner] 19:48:20
THE SERGEANTS, THEY ARE RETIRING


[Captioner] 19:48:20
EARLY, OKAY?


[Captioner] 19:48:22
ALL RIGHT?


[Captioner] 19:48:24
AND THEN BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT


[Captioner] 19:48:27
TO BE ACCOUNTABLE FOR SOMETHING


[Captioner] 19:48:27
STUPID, ALL RIGHT?


[Captioner] 19:48:29
WE WANT THE LAW ENFORCEMENT, WE


[Captioner] 19:48:31
NEED THE BUDGET FOR THEM AND FIX


[Captioner] 19:48:34
THE DAMN LAW SO THAT PEOPLE IN


[Captioner] 19:48:35
FREMONT AS WELL AS THE BAY AREA


[Captioner] 19:48:36
ARE SAFE, OKAY?


[Captioner] 19:48:37
HERE'S MY STAT FOR YOU.


[Captioner] 19:48:40
EVERY DAY WE HAVE INTRUDERS.


[Captioner] 19:48:41
EVERY DAY WE HAVE THEFTS.


[Captioner] 19:48:45
I'M NOT EVEN MENTIONING


[Captioner] 19:48:47
ABOUT PETTY THEFTS, WE'RE


[Captioner] 19:48:48
TALKING ABOUT HOME INVASION, ALL
RIGHT?


[Captioner] 19:48:48
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:48:50
>> Ms. Gauthier: THE NEXT


[Captioner] 19:48:51
SPEAKER IS NAVI.


[Captioner] 19:48:59
>> HI.


[Captioner] 19:49:00
CAN YOU HEAR ME?


[Captioner] 19:49:02
>> Ms. Gauthier: YES.


[Captioner] 19:49:02
>> ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:49:05
THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO
SPEAK.


[Captioner] 19:49:08
I'M A HOMEOWNER AT THE PATTERSON


[Captioner] 19:49:09
RANCH COMMUNITY IN ARDENWOOD.


[Captioner] 19:49:11
I'D LIKE TO ECHO WHAT SOME OF MY


[Captioner] 19:49:12
COMMUNITY MEMBERS HAVE ALREADY
VOICED.


[Captioner] 19:49:15
REGARDING THE RAPIDLY GROWING


[Captioner] 19:49:21
ISSUE OF PROPERTY CRIME, AUTO


[Captioner] 19:49:24
BREAK-INS, AUTO THEFT, THIS IS A


[Captioner] 19:49:25
MAJOR ISSUE THAT'S HAPPENING IN


[Captioner] 19:49:25
OUR COMMUNITY.


[Captioner] 19:49:28
THERE'S A LOT OF MAJOR LONG TERM


[Captioner] 19:49:30
REPERCUSSION, NOT TO MENTION THE


[Captioner] 19:49:32
DETERIORATING SENSE OF


[Captioner] 19:49:33
PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PHYSICAL


[Captioner] 19:49:33
SAFETY THAT I PERSONALLY FEEL.


[Captioner] 19:49:35
I PERSONALLY HAVE EXPERIENCED


[Captioner] 19:49:38
THREE OF THESE AUTO BREAK-INS


[Captioner] 19:49:40
FOR VEHICLES -- TWO OF THESE


[Captioner] 19:49:41
VEHICLES WERE PARKED DIRECTLY ON


[Captioner] 19:49:43
MY DRIVEWAY AND A THIRD WAS


[Captioner] 19:49:44
PARKED AT A PLACE OF WORSHIP IN
FREMONT.


[Captioner] 19:49:47
SIMILARLY MY NEIGHBORS HAVE BEEN


[Captioner] 19:49:49
VICTIMS OF THESE KINDS OF


[Captioner] 19:49:51
SITUATIONS AND ONE CAN LOOK AT


[Captioner] 19:49:54
THE LATEST FREMONT POLICE REPORT


[Captioner] 19:49:55
TO SEE THIS IS A GROWING TREND.


[Captioner] 19:49:57
SO I DO COMMEND THE FREMONT


[Captioner] 19:49:59
POLICE DEPARTMENT FOR ARRIVING


[Captioner] 19:50:00
QUICKLY EACH TIME THAT THIS
HAPPENED.


[Captioner] 19:50:02
BUT I'M ALARMED TO HEAR THAT THE


[Captioner] 19:50:04
POLICE CLAIMS TO NOT HAVE THE


[Captioner] 19:50:06
AUTHORITY TO PURSUE THESE
PERPETRATORS.


[Captioner] 19:50:08
GIVEN THE APPARENT RECENT


[Captioner] 19:50:10
RELAXED LAWS WHICH HAVE


[Captioner] 19:50:12
CLASSIFIED SOME OF THESE CRIMES


[Captioner] 19:50:14
TO PETTY STATUS WITH NO REAL
PUNISHMENT.


[Captioner] 19:50:16
SO MY CONCERN IS THIS WILL LEAD


[Captioner] 19:50:18
TO EVEN MORE SERIOUS CRIMES THAT


[Captioner] 19:50:21
A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE VOICE IN


[Captioner] 19:50:23
THIS CALL EARLIER GIVEN THERE'S


[Captioner] 19:50:27
NO ATABILITY FOR THESE BAD


[Captioner] 19:50:27
CHARACTERS TODAY.


[Captioner] 19:50:29
SO I URGE YOU TO START MAKING


[Captioner] 19:50:30
REFORMS AT THE CITY LEVEL TO


[Captioner] 19:50:32
START WITH SO THESE PERPETRATORS


[Captioner] 19:50:34
WILL FACE STRICTER CONSEQUENCES


[Captioner] 19:50:36
AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN RESTORE A


[Captioner] 19:50:37
SENSE OF SAFETY TO THE CITY


[Captioner] 19:50:39
WHICH IS SEVERELY LACKING RIGHT
NOW.


[Captioner] 19:50:42
I ALSO LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING


[Captioner] 19:50:43
WHAT ELSE THE CITY IS DOING TO


[Captioner] 19:50:44
PREVENT THIS.


[Captioner] 19:50:44
THANK YOU SO MUCH.


[Captioner] 19:50:46
>> Ms. Gauthier: THAT'S THE


[Captioner] 19:50:46
LAST SPEAKER.


[Captioner] 19:50:48
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:50:53
JUST TO CLARIFY, ITEMS THAT ARE


[Captioner] 19:50:55
NOT AGENDIZED, THE COUNCIL DOES


[Captioner] 19:50:56
NOT ADDRESS IT, BUT I WILL LET


[Captioner] 19:50:58
YOU KNOW THAT WE HAVE RECEIVED


[Captioner] 19:51:00
SOME OF THESE COMMENTS AND I


[Captioner] 19:51:02
KNOW THAT WE'VE SHARED THEM WITH


[Captioner] 19:51:06
OUR POLICE CHIEF AND THE


[Captioner] 19:51:07
DEPARTMENT, SO THEY WILL BE
RESPONDING.


[Captioner] 19:51:14
NEXT ON THE AGENDA ITEM THIS


[Captioner] 19:51:15
EVENING IS CONSIDERATION FOR


[Captioner] 19:51:17
ITEMS THAT WERE REMOVED FROM THE


[Captioner] 19:51:17

AND WE'LL DO UP TO 2 MINUTES FOR


[Captioner] 19:51:22
EACH SPEAKER.


[Captioner] 19:51:23
A QUICK REMINDER THAT WE'LL NEED


[Captioner] 19:51:25
A BREAK AROUND 8:30.


[Captioner] 19:51:29
SO DO WE WANT TO CALL THE


[Captioner] 19:51:34
 SPEAKERS FOR
ITEM 2D.


[Captioner] 19:51:35
>> Ms. Gauthier: YES, I HAVE


[Captioner] 19:51:37

[Captioner] 19:57:44
ONE THING THAT I CAN TELL YOU


[Captioner] 19:57:47
FROM BEING AN EDUCATOR IS THAT


[Captioner] 19:57:48
REPRESENTATION MATTERS.


[Captioner] 19:57:53

[Captioner] 19:57:55
BROWN STUDENTS TO SEE PEOPLE

THAT LOOK LIKE THEM IN POSITIONS


[Captioner] 19:57:57
OF POWER.


[Captioner] 19:58:01

KENG FOR ALL SHE'S DONE AND ALSO


[Captioner] 19:58:52
CONGRATULATE OUR NEW VICE MAYOR,


[Captioner] 19:58:53
TERESA COX, WITH A POEM.


[Captioner] 19:58:55
TIRED OF ALL THE COMMOTION AND


[Captioner] 19:58:56
DEBACLE SO YOU PUT IT IN A
BOTTLE.


[Captioner] 19:58:58
YOU CARRY THE BOTTLE IN YOUR


[Captioner] 19:58:59
FRONT POCKET AND EVERY DAY YOU


[Captioner] 19:59:00
MAKE A NEW DEPOSIT.


[Captioner] 19:59:02
WHEN DID PEOPLE DECIDE IT WAS


[Captioner] 19:59:03
OKAY TO BLAME YOU FOR SOMETHING


[Captioner] 19:59:05
YOU DIDN'T CHOOSE, YOUR BODY,


[Captioner] 19:59:05
FACE, GENDER, RACE.


[Captioner] 19:59:07
WE ARE NOT HERE TO BE COMPARED


[Captioner] 19:59:08
OR JUDGED.


[Captioner] 19:59:10
WHEN DID IT BECOME OKAY TO JUDGE


[Captioner] 19:59:11
SOMEONE'S APPEARANCE BEFORE


[Captioner] 19:59:12
BEING INTRODUCED TO THE


[Captioner] 19:59:13
EXISTENCE WITHIN THEM?


[Captioner] 19:59:15
WE ARE OUR OWN HOMES, BAGS OF


[Captioner] 19:59:16
SKIN AND BONE.


[Captioner] 19:59:18
WE CANNOT BE TREATED AS A LABEL


[Captioner] 19:59:20
OR A MET A PHOR.


[Captioner] 19:59:22
WE SHOULDN'T HAVE TO CHEW OUR


[Captioner] 19:59:23
WORDS SO THEY ARE SOFT, TREATED


[Captioner] 19:59:25
WITH DELICACY AND INCOMPETENCE,


[Captioner] 19:59:27
WE THINK OF A BOX LOCKED AWAY AS


[Captioner] 19:59:29
IF IT WOULD BRING US PEACE,


[Captioner] 19:59:29
PROSPERITY AND WEALTH.


[Captioner] 19:59:31
WE AREN'T SUPPOSED TO SPEAK UP


[Captioner] 19:59:32
FOR THE LIFE WE WANT TO LIVE FOR


[Captioner] 19:59:33
THE GENERATIONS TO COME OR TO


[Captioner] 19:59:34
MAKE RIGHT IN A WORLD OF WRONG.


[Captioner] 19:59:36
SIT IN YOUR SEAT AND LISTEN.


[Captioner] 19:59:38
NO ONE WANTS REBEL BECAUSE THEY


[Captioner] 19:59:39
KNOW WHO CAN START A REVOLUTION


[Captioner] 19:59:42
SO OUR MINDS SLOWLY WEAKEN


[Captioner] 19:59:44
BECAUSE OUR HOPE FADES, OUR


[Captioner] 19:59:45
VOICE BECOMES SHAKY BECAUSE OF


[Captioner] 19:59:46
HOW MANY TIMES WE'VE HAD TO


[Captioner] 19:59:46
SPEAK UP.


[Captioner] 19:59:48
OUR PAIN AND WORTH IS NOT ENOUGH


[Captioner] 19:59:49
PROOF BECAUSE WHAT OTHERS


[Captioner] 19:59:50
PERCEIVE IS THAT WE ARE AN
EXCUSE.


[Captioner] 19:59:52
BUT PEOPLE WHO ARE SUFFERING,


[Captioner] 19:59:55
WHO HAVE OPINION THROUGH WHAT NO


[Captioner] 19:59:56
HUMAN SHOULD DON'T WANT THEIR


[Captioner] 19:59:57
CHILDREN TO WORRY ABOUT CULTURE


[Captioner] 19:59:59
AND I A PEERNS BEING MI STEA KEN


[Captioner] 20:00:01
FOR A THREAT BUT AS A GROUP WE


[Captioner] 20:00:01
ARE SPHRONGER.


[Captioner] 20:00:03
WE PICK OUR BATTLES AT ANY
COST.


[Captioner] 20:00:06
WE ARE PEOPLE.


[Captioner] 20:00:09
SOME BODIES, THEY PRAY THAT YOU
WON'T.


[Captioner] 20:00:12
THOUGH THEY ARE HIDDEN, WITH


[Captioner] 20:00:13
FEAR AND ANGER, CAN'T SEEM TO BE


[Captioner] 20:00:13
PUT OUT.


[Captioner] 20:00:15

[Captioner] 20:00:17
FRONT POUCH CLOSE TO YOUR HEART


[Captioner] 20:00:18
BUT NOT YOUR BRAIN, WE'LL KEEP


[Captioner] 20:00:19

ROLE AS VICE MAYOR OF CITY OF

FIJI OR EVEN INDIA OR PAKISTAN.


[Captioner] 20:02:11
BEING 1%, I WOULD SAY THAT SHE


[Captioner] 20:02:12
IS ONE OF THE WOMEN WHO THINKS


[Captioner] 20:02:13
NO ONE IS LEFT BEHIND.


[Captioner] 20:02:18
NO MATTER HOW HIGH YOU GO, SHE


[Captioner] 20:02:19
STILL LOOKS DOWN TO PEOPLE WHO


[Captioner] 20:02:20
ARE THE ROOTS AND THEN SHE


[Captioner] 20:02:20
REALLY REMEMBERS.


[Captioner] 20:02:22

>> Mayor Mei: IS THAT THE


[Captioner] 20:23:59
FINAL SPEAKER?


[Captioner] 20:23:59
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:24:04
SO I JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY TOO


[Captioner] 20:24:06
THAT FOR THIS AGENDA ITEM,


[Captioner] 20:24:08
ITEM 2D, I WANTED TO THANK THE


[Captioner] 20:24:08
WISDOM OF SOME OF THE PEOPLE


[Captioner] 20:24:10
THAT CAME BEFORE ME AND I'M SO


[Captioner] 20:24:13
FORTUNATE TO STAND ON THEIR
SHOULDERS.


[Captioner] 20:24:15
MAYOR GUS MORRISON, I BELIEVE


[Captioner] 20:24:18
STARTED THIS PROCESS WHERE WE


[Captioner] 20:24:21
ROTATE, AND THE HANDBOOK


[Captioner] 20:24:23
DICTATES THAT THE COUNCILMEMBER


[Captioner] 20:24:24
THAT RECEIVES THE HIGHEST NUMBER


[Captioner] 20:24:26
OF VOTES DURING THE PREVIOUS


[Captioner] 20:24:27
MUNICIPAL ELECTION GETS TO BE


[Captioner] 20:24:30
APPOINTED VICE MAYOR, AND THEN


[Captioner] 20:24:31
FOLLOWING NEXT, THE GENERAL


[Captioner] 20:24:33
MUNICIPAL ELECTION, IT GOES IN


[Captioner] 20:24:34
THAT ORDER, THE COUNCILMEMBER


[Captioner] 20:24:36
WHO RECEIVES THE SECOND HIGHEST


[Captioner] 20:24:38
NUMBER OF VOTES, AND SO ON,


[Captioner] 20:24:40
UNTIL WHO RECEIVES THE THIRD


[Captioner] 20:24:40
HIGHEST NUMBER OF VOTES.


[Captioner] 20:24:42
BUT WHEN WE MADE A CHANGE A


[Captioner] 20:24:44
COUPLE YEARS AGO TO GO FROM AT


[Captioner] 20:24:47
LARGE TO DISTRICT ELECTIONS, WE


[Captioner] 20:24:49
DIDN'T WANT ANY OF OUR


[Captioner] 20:24:52
COUNCILMEMBERS TO FEEL NOT


[Captioner] 20:24:53
REPRESENTED, AND IT'S SOMETHING


[Captioner] 20:24:55
THAT WE STRIVE FOR AS A COUNCIL


[Captioner] 20:24:58
TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE DIVERSITY


[Captioner] 20:24:58
AND REPRESENTATION.


[Captioner] 20:25:01
SO I JUST WANTED TO LET PEOPLE


[Captioner] 20:25:04
KNOW THAT WE MADE A CHANGE BACK


[Captioner] 20:25:10
THEN TO MODIFY TO 8 MONTHS SO


[Captioner] 20:25:11
THAT ALLOWS EVERY COUNCILMEMBER


[Captioner] 20:25:13
TO BE ABLE TO SERVE AS THE VICE
MAYOR.


[Captioner] 20:25:14
IT VERY IMPORTANT FOR US TO HAVE


[Captioner] 20:25:15
THAT REPRESENTATION.


[Captioner] 20:25:17
SO PER THE ORDER OF SELECTION OF


[Captioner] 20:25:20
THE VICE MAYOR DESCRIBED ABOVE,


[Captioner] 20:25:20
COUNCILMEMBER TERESA COX IS NEXT


[Captioner] 20:25:23

MAYOR FOR THE PERIOD COVERING


[Captioner] 20:25:28
MARCH OF 2023 THROUGH NOVEMBER,


[Captioner] 20:25:30
AS SHE RECEIVED THE THIRD


[Captioner] 20:25:32
HIGHEST NUMBER OF VOTES IN THE


[Captioner] 20:25:32
2020 GENERAL MUNICIPAL
ELECTION.


[Captioner] 20:25:36
SO I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE A MOTION


[Captioner] 20:25:37

[Captioner] 20:25:39
COX AND SECONDED BY

EVENING IS PARTICULARLY NOTABLE 


[Captioner] 20:45:17
BECAUSE IT IS THE FINAL YEAR OF 


[Captioner] 20:45:21
THE 2015 TO 2023 HOUSING ELEMENT 


[Captioner] 20:45:22
PLANNING PERIOD.


[Captioner] 20:45:24
THIS MEANS THAT WITH THIS AP 


[Captioner] 20:45:25
RATIFY WE ARE OFFICIALLY CLOSING 


[Captioner] 20:45:28
THE BOOKS ON THE LAST HOUSING 


[Captioner] 20:45:30
ELEMENT CYCLE AND TURNING THE 


[Captioner] 20:45:31
PAGE AND REFOCUSING OUR EFFORTS 


[Captioner] 20:45:33
ON THE NEXT EIGHT YEAR CYCLE IN 


[Captioner] 20:45:34
FRONT OF US.


[Captioner] 20:45:37
NEXT SLIDE PLEASE.


[Captioner] 20:45:40
HERE'S JUST A QUICK LOOK AT THE 


[Captioner] 20:45:41
PRESENTATION FOR THIS EVENING.


[Captioner] 20:45:43
I'LL START WITH SOME BACKGROUND 


[Captioner] 20:45:46
ON THE CITY'S GENERAL PLAN AND 


[Captioner] 20:45:47
HOUSING ELEMENT.


[Captioner] 20:45:48
I'LL REVIEW HOUSING PRODUCTION 


[Captioner] 20:45:50
DATA IN 2022 AND WHERE THE CITY 


[Captioner] 20:45:52
IS IN TERMS OF MEETING OUR 


[Captioner] 20:45:53
PRODUCTION GOALS.


[Captioner] 20:45:54
AND THEN I'LL JUST END WITH A 


[Captioner] 20:45:56
FEW HIGHLIGHTS OF HOUSING 


[Captioner] 20:45:57
ELEMENT PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION 


[Captioner] 20:45:58
OVER THE PAST YEAR.


[Captioner] 20:46:01
SO LET'S START WITH SOME 


[Captioner] 20:46:01
BACKGROUND.


[Captioner] 20:46:02
NEXT SLIDE PLEASE.


[Captioner] 20:46:08
GENERAL LAW CITIES IN CALIFORNIA 


[Captioner] 20:46:09
LIKE THE CITY OF FREMONT ARE 


[Captioner] 20:46:11
REQUIRED TO HAVE AN ADOPTED 


[Captioner] 20:46:11
GENERAL PLAN.


[Captioner] 20:46:13
AND THE GENERAL PLAN IS OFTEN 


[Captioner] 20:46:15
CALLED THE CITY'S CONSTITUTION 


[Captioner] 20:46:17
FOR GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT.


[Captioner] 20:46:19
AND IT SERVES AS A POLICY 


[Captioner] 20:46:21
FOUNDATION UPON WHICH ALL LAND 


[Captioner] 20:46:22
USE DECISION ARE BASED.


[Captioner] 20:46:24
A GENERAL PLAN IS ORGANIZED INTO 


[Captioner] 20:46:26
VARIOUS CHAPTERS OR ELEMENTS.


[Captioner] 20:46:27
AND EACH ONE OF THOSE 


[Captioner] 20:46:30
ESTABLISHES A POLICY FRAMEWORK 


[Captioner] 20:46:32
AROUND OPARTICULAR TOPIC.


[Captioner] 20:46:33
NEXT SLIDE PLEASE.


[Captioner] 20:46:38
AND ONE OF THOSE AREAS IS THE 


[Captioner] 20:46:39
HOUSING ELEMENT.


[Captioner] 20:46:41
THE PURPOSE OF THE HOUSING 


[Captioner] 20:46:43
ELEMENT IS TO ENSURE THAT EACH 


[Captioner] 20:46:46
PERSON HAS ACCESS TO DECENT AND 


[Captioner] 20:46:47
AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THEIR 


[Captioner] 20:46:48
COMMUNITY.


[Captioner] 20:46:50
UNDER STATE LAW CITIES IN 


[Captioner] 20:46:51
CALIFORNIA ARE REQUIRED TO 


[Captioner] 20:46:52
UPDATE THEIR HOUSING ELEMENTS 


[Captioner] 20:46:54
EVERY EIGHT YEARS AND ALSO UNDER 


[Captioner] 20:46:56
STATE LAW CITIES ARE REQUIRED TO 


[Captioner] 20:46:57
PREPARE AN ANNUAL PROGRESS 


[Captioner] 20:46:59
REPORT ON ITS HOUSING ELEMENT 


[Captioner] 20:47:00
EVERY YEAR.


[Captioner] 20:47:03
AND THE PURPOSE OF THIS APR IS 


[Captioner] 20:47:05
TO REFLECT ON HOW WELL THE 


[Captioner] 20:47:07
CITY'S MEETING ITS HOUSING GOALS 


[Captioner] 20:47:08
IN ORDER TO BETTER INFORM POLICY 


[Captioner] 20:47:11
DECISIONS MOVING FORWARD.


[Captioner] 20:47:14
THE APRS THAT WE HAVE DONE EACH 


[Captioner] 20:47:16
OF THE PAST EIGHT YEARS PLAYED A 


[Captioner] 20:47:17
REALLY CRITICAL ROLE IN MAKING 


[Captioner] 20:47:19
SURE THAT WE WERE MAKING SMART 


[Captioner] 20:47:22
AND INFORMED DECISIONS, IN THE 


[Captioner] 20:47:23
NEW HOUSING ELEMENT THAT THE 


[Captioner] 20:47:26
COUNCIL JUST RECENTLY ADOPTED.


[Captioner] 20:47:27
NEXT SLIDE, PLEASE.


[Captioner] 20:47:33
A KEY COMPONENT TO THE A PRMPLET 


[Captioner] 20:47:39
 APR IS 


[Captioner] 20:47:42
REACHING OUR RHNA TARGETS.


[Captioner] 20:47:44
RHNA IS A LONG STANDING PROCESS 


[Captioner] 20:47:48
IN CALIFORNIA WHICH IS INTENDED 


[Captioner] 20:47:49
TO ENSURE THAT ALL JURISDICTIONS 


[Captioner] 20:47:51
IN THE STATE ARE APPROPRIATELY 


[Captioner] 20:47:52
PLANNING TO ACCOMMODATE THEIR 


[Captioner] 20:47:55
FAIR SHARE OF THE STATE'S 


[Captioner] 20:47:56
HOUSING NEEDS.


[Captioner] 20:47:58
THE RHNA PROCESS STARTS AT THE 


[Captioner] 20:48:00
STATE LEVEL WHERE THE STATE 


[Captioner] 20:48:01
CLAIGHTS THE HOUSING NEEDS OF 


[Captioner] 20:48:04
WHAT THE REGION ARE AND THE 


[Captioner] 20:48:08
REGIONAL GOVERNMENT ASSIGNS THAT 


[Captioner] 20:48:09
RESPONSIBILITY AND THEN THE 


[Captioner] 20:48:10
RESPONSIBILITY FALLS ON LOCAL 


[Captioner] 20:48:12
JURISDICTIONS TO ENSURE THAT 


[Captioner] 20:48:14
THEY HAVE THE ZONING AND THE 


[Captioner] 20:48:16
SITES IN PLACE TO BE ABLED TO 


[Captioner] 20:48:18
ACCOMMODATE THAT NEED.


[Captioner] 20:48:22
FOR THE PERIOD FREMONT'S RHNA 


[Captioner] 20:48:26
WAS SET AT 5,455 TOTAL UNITS 


[Captioner] 20:48:28
WHICH IS BROKEN DOWN FURTHER 


[Captioner] 20:48:30
INTO AFFORDABILITY LEVELS.


[Captioner] 20:48:34
AND THE CITY'S LOWER INCOME AND 


[Captioner] 20:48:37
MODERATE INCOME HOUSING NEEDS 


[Captioner] 20:48:40
ACTUALLY MAKE ARE UP A MAJORITY 


[Captioner] 20:48:42
OF THE CITY'S OVERALL HOUSING 


[Captioner] 20:48:43
NEEDS.


[Captioner] 20:48:44
NEXT SLIDE PLEASE.


[Captioner] 20:48:47
AS I MENTIONED EARLIER, 2022 IS 


[Captioner] 20:48:49
THE FINAL YEAR OF THE HOUSING 


[Captioner] 20:48:49
ELEMENT CYCLE.


[Captioner] 20:48:52
TO DATA ON THIS SLIDE -- SO THE 


[Captioner] 20:48:56
DATA ON THIS SLIDE REFLECTS 


[Captioner] 20:48:58
FREMONT'S TOTAL PRODUCTION 


[Captioner] 20:49:03
DURING THE 2022 PERIOD.


[Captioner] 20:49:05
FREMONT WAS SUCCESSFUL IN 


[Captioner] 20:49:09
MEETING ITS TOTAL RHNA TARGETS 


[Captioner] 20:49:12
BY PRODUCING CLOSE TO 8,000 


[Captioner] 20:49:13
TOTAL UNITS.


[Captioner] 20:49:16
ANOTHER TAKE AWAY LIKE MANY 


[Captioner] 20:49:18
CITIES IN THE STATE, FREMONT 


[Captioner] 20:49:19
FELL SHORT IN THE AFFORDABLE 


[Captioner] 20:49:20
CATEGORIES.


[Captioner] 20:49:21
IT IS NOTABLE THOUGH THAT IN 


[Captioner] 20:49:25
FREMONT WE PRODUCED OVER 1300 


[Captioner] 20:49:26
AFFORDABLE UNITS DURING THE PAST 


[Captioner] 20:49:29
CYCLE WHICH IS FAR AND AWAY -- 


[Captioner] 20:49:33
WHICH FAR AND AWAY EXCEEDS THE 


[Captioner] 20:49:34
AFFORDABLE HOUSING PRODUCTION 


[Captioner] 20:49:37
FROM PREVIOUS CYCLES.


[Captioner] 20:49:39
JUST FOR CONTEXT, IN THE CYCLE 


[Captioner] 20:49:42
PRECEDING THIS ONE, ONLY 492 


[Captioner] 20:49:44
AFFORDABLE UNITS WERE PRODUCED.


[Captioner] 20:49:45
NEXT SLIDE, PLEASE.


[Captioner] 20:49:50
IN 2022, PERMITS WERE ISSUED FOR 


[Captioner] 20:49:53
OVER 1100 UNITS, WHICH ACTUALLY 


[Captioner] 20:49:55
MAKES 2022 THE THIRD HIGHEST 


[Captioner] 20:49:57
YEAR FOR PRODUCTION IN THE 


[Captioner] 20:49:57
PLANNING PERIOD.


[Captioner] 20:50:01
SOME NOTABLE PROJECTS THAT 


[Captioner] 20:50:03
RECEIVED BUILDING PERMITS WERE 


[Captioner] 20:50:06
THE FREMONT BANK RESIDENCES 


[Captioner] 20:50:09
PROJECT IN DOWNTOWN, THE OSGOOD 


[Captioner] 20:50:11
AFFORDABLE UNITS IN IRVINGTON 


[Captioner] 20:50:15
AND THE ALLIED HOUSING FREMONT 


[Captioner] 20:50:17
FAMILY HOUSING PROJECT WHICH IS 


[Captioner] 20:50:19
ANOTHER AFFORDABLE PROJECT IN 


[Captioner] 20:50:21
FREMONT.


[Captioner] 20:50:23
THE PRODUCTION IN THE WARM 


[Captioner] 20:50:24
SPRINGS DISTRICT ALSO CONTINUED 


[Captioner] 20:50:26
TO BE VERY STRONG AND ANOTHER 


[Captioner] 20:50:30
KEY CONTRIBUTOR WAS ACCESSORY 


[Captioner] 20:50:32
DWELLING UNITS OR ADUS.


[Captioner] 20:50:34
NEXT SLIDE PLEASE.


[Captioner] 20:50:37
149 ADUS WERE PERMITTED IN 2022, 


[Captioner] 20:50:41
WHICH IS NEARLY TWICE AS MANY 


[Captioner] 20:50:42
ADUS IN THE PREVIOUS YEAR AND 


[Captioner] 20:50:44
ABOUT FIVE TIMES AS MANY AS IN 


[Captioner] 20:50:45
2018.


[Captioner] 20:50:47
THIS TREND INDICATES THAT ADUS 


[Captioner] 20:50:50
ARE BECOMING MORE POPULAR AND 


[Captioner] 20:50:52
MORE ACCESSIBLE, AND ALSO THAT 


[Captioner] 20:50:54
THE CITY HAS DONE A GOOD JOB IN 


[Captioner] 20:50:55
SUPPORTING THE GROWTH.


[Captioner] 20:51:01
WE'VE KNOWN FOR A LONG TIME THAT 


[Captioner] 20:51:05
ADUS PROVIDE THE COMMUNITY WITH 


[Captioner] 20:51:07
HOUSING THAT'S NATURALLY 


[Captioner] 20:51:08
AFFORDABLE JUST BY DESIGN.


[Captioner] 20:51:12
BUT WE'VE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO 


[Captioner] 20:51:18
CREDIT ADUS TOWARD OUR 


[Captioner] 20:51:20
AFFORDABLE HOUSING GOALS UNTIL 


[Captioner] 20:51:22
NOW.


[Captioner] 20:51:25
TAKING CREDIT FOR ADUS IN OUR 


[Captioner] 20:51:28
APR AND WE WERE ABLE TO DO THAT, 


[Captioner] 20:51:31
PREPARED BY ABAG WHICH BASICALLY 


[Captioner] 20:51:32
SHOWED THAT HAPPEN ON AVERAGE 


[Captioner] 20:51:37
ABOUT 90% OF ADUS IN THE ROOJ 


[Captioner] 20:51:38
ARE RENTED AT RATES AFFORDABLE 


[Captioner] 20:51:41
TO LOWER INCOME AND MODERATE 


[Captioner] 20:51:42
INCOME HOUSEHOLDS.


[Captioner] 20:51:43
NEXT SLIDE, PLEASE.


[Captioner] 20:51:47
WITH RESPECT TO AFFORDABLE 


[Captioner] 20:51:50
HOUSING, THE CITY PERMITTED TWO 


[Captioner] 20:51:51
MAJOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING 


[Captioner] 20:51:52
PROJECTS IN 2022.


[Captioner] 20:51:55
ONE IS THE ALLIED HOUSING 


[Captioner] 20:51:57
FREMONT FAMILY APARTMENTS 


[Captioner] 20:51:58
PROJECT WHICH IS LOCATED IN 


[Captioner] 20:51:59
NORTH FREMONT NEAR THE 


[Captioner] 20:52:01
INTERSECTION OF FREMONT 


[Captioner] 20:52:03
BOULEVARD AND PASEO PADRE, THIS 


[Captioner] 20:52:05
PROJECT WILL INCLUDE 53 


[Captioner] 20:52:07
AFFORDABLE UNITS AND THE SECOND 


[Captioner] 20:52:09
PROJECT IS THE OSGOOD APARTMENTS 


[Captioner] 20:52:11
PROJECT WHICH IS LOCATED REALLY 


[Captioner] 20:52:14
CLOSE TO THE FUTURE IRVINGTON 


[Captioner] 20:52:14
BART STATION.


[Captioner] 20:52:17
AND THIS PROJECT WILL INCLUDE 


[Captioner] 20:52:19
111 AFFORDABLE UNITS WHEN IT'S 


[Captioner] 20:52:19
COMPLETE.


[Captioner] 20:52:23
AND THESE ARE JUST TWO OF MANY 


[Captioner] 20:52:23
AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS THAT 


[Captioner] 20:52:25
THE CITY PRODUCED DURING THE 


[Captioner] 20:52:27
LAST CYCLE.


[Captioner] 20:52:27
NEXT SLIDE, PLEASE.


[Captioner] 20:52:33
THE 2015 TO 2023 HOUSING ELEMENT 


[Captioner] 20:52:36
CONTAINS EIGHT POLLS?


[Captioner] 20:52:39
22 POLICIES AND 69 


[Captioner] 20:52:40
IMPLEMENTATION PROGRAMS.


[Captioner] 20:52:42
TABLE D IN THE APR INCLUDES AN 


[Captioner] 20:52:45
UPDATE ON ALL 69 PROGRAMS.


[Captioner] 20:52:47
AND THIS SLIDE HIGHLIGHTS JUST A 


[Captioner] 20:52:48
FEW OF THEM.


[Captioner] 20:52:51
BECAUSE THERE'S ONLY REALLY TIME 


[Captioner] 20:52:53
TO TALK ABOUT A FEW PROGRAMS, WE 


[Captioner] 20:52:55
THOUGHT ABOUT WHAT REALLY STOOD 


[Captioner] 20:52:59
OUT TO US WHEN WE WERE REVIEWING -- WHEN WE WERE 


[Captioner] 20:53:01
REVIEWING THE LIST OF 


[Captioner] 20:53:02
ACCOMPLISHMENTS OVER THE FAST 


[Captioner] 20:53:02
YEAR.


[Captioner] 20:53:04
AND ONE THING THAT STOOD OUT TO 


[Captioner] 20:53:06
ME IN PARTICULAR WAS 2022 WAS A 


[Captioner] 20:53:09
PRETTY NOTABLE YEAR IN TERMS OF 


[Captioner] 20:53:10
COMMUNICATING WITH THE COMMUNITY 


[Captioner] 20:53:11
ABOUT HOUSING ISSUES.


[Captioner] 20:53:12
MANY OF THESE CONVERSATIONS WERE 


[Captioner] 20:53:14
PART OF OUTREACH FOR THE HOUSING 


[Captioner] 20:53:16
ELEMENT.


[Captioner] 20:53:18
AND ADDITIONALLY, THE CITY 


[Captioner] 20:53:20
PARTICIPATED IN EVENTS SUCH AS 


[Captioner] 20:53:23
AN ADU HOME OWNERS FAIR TO 


[Captioner] 20:53:26
EDUCATE THE COMMUNITY ABOUT 


[Captioner] 20:53:28
ADUs, THE CITY'S HOUSING 


[Captioner] 20:53:31
DIVISION HELD AN AFFORDABLE 


[Captioner] 20:53:35
HOUSING 101 WEBINAR ATTENDED BY 


[Captioner] 20:53:37
OWNERSHIP 100 PEOPLE AND A LARGE 


[Captioner] 20:53:39
TRAINING FOR LANDLORDS AROUND 


[Captioner] 20:53:40
PROPERTY MANAGERS AND THAT WAS 


[Captioner] 20:53:43
ATTENDED BY OVER 100 PEOPLE AND 


[Captioner] 20:53:44
ALL THESE CONVERSATIONS TOGETHER 


[Captioner] 20:53:46
HELPED US BETTER UNDERSTAND 


[Captioner] 20:53:47
ISSUES AROUND HOUSING AND THAT'S 


[Captioner] 20:53:50
GOING TO REALLY HELP OUR WORK 


[Captioner] 20:53:52
MOVING FORWARD IN ADVANCING OUR 


[Captioner] 20:53:53
HOUSING GOALS.


[Captioner] 20:53:54
AND AGAIN THESE ARE JUST A FEW 


[Captioner] 20:53:56
OF MANY PROGRAMS THAT THE CITY 


[Captioner] 20:53:57
ADVANCED DURING THE PAST YEAR.


[Captioner] 20:53:58
NEXT SLIDE PLEASE.


[Captioner] 20:54:01
IN CONCLUSION, THE 


[Captioner] 20:54:02
RECOMMENDATION THIS EVENING IS 


[Captioner] 20:54:05
TO FIND THAT THE APR IS NOT 


[Captioner] 20:54:07
SUBJECT TO ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW 


[Captioner] 20:54:09
UNDER CEQA AND ACCEPT THE APR 


[Captioner] 20:54:11
AND DIRECT STAFF TO FORWARD IT 


[Captioner] 20:54:12
ON TO THE STATE FOR THEIR 


[Captioner] 20:54:13
RECORDS.


[Captioner] 20:54:13
NEXT SLIDE PLEASE.


[Captioner] 20:54:16
THIS CONCLUDES MY PRESENTATION.


[Captioner] 20:54:17
I AM AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY 


[Captioner] 20:54:18
QUESTIONS THAT THE COUNCIL MAY 


[Captioner] 20:54:19
HAVE.


[Captioner] 20:54:23
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU BOTH 


[Captioner] 20:54:25
TO WAYLAND AND TO YOUR ENTIRE 


[Captioner] 20:54:26
TEAM.


[Captioner] 20:54:29
AND I WANTED TO SEE AT THIS TIME 


[Captioner] 20:54:32
IF THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS FROM 


[Captioner] 20:54:32
COUNCILMEMBERS.


[Captioner] 20:54:34
SO QUESTIONS.


[Captioner] 20:54:38
I SEE COUNCILMEMBER KENG FOR 


[Captioner] 20:54:39
CLARIFYING QUESTIONS.


[Captioner] 20:54:43
>> Vice Mayor Keng:   THANK YOU 


[Captioner] 20:54:44
MADAM MAYOR AND THANK YOU VERY 


[Captioner] 20:54:46
MUCH FOR THE REPORT.


[Captioner] 20:54:47
IT IS ENCOURAGING TO SEE THAT WE 


[Captioner] 20:54:50
HAVE MET OUR OVERALL NUMBER.


[Captioner] 20:54:53
AND ALTHOUGH WE FELL SHORT IN 


[Captioner] 20:54:54
THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS, 


[Captioner] 20:54:57
EVEN THOUGH WE DID BUILD MORE 


[Captioner] 20:55:00
THAN ANY OTHER CYCLES BEFORE.


[Captioner] 20:55:04
SO MY QUESTION IS, I'M WONDERING 


[Captioner] 20:55:09
IF THERE IS ANY INCENTIVES, YOU 


[Captioner] 20:55:12
KNOW, OTHER THAN THE IN LIEU 


[Captioner] 20:55:13
FEES?


[Captioner] 20:55:16
LIKE IS THERE ANY INCENTIVES 


[Captioner] 20:55:18
THAT FOR THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING 


[Captioner] 20:55:20
PROJECTS IN PERMITTING PROCESS 


[Captioner] 20:55:22
CURRENTLY THAT, YOU KNOW, ARE WE 


[Captioner] 20:55:24
GIVING THEM ANY LIKE FAST TRACK 


[Captioner] 20:55:27
OR, YOU KNOW, IF WE CAN POSSIBLY 


[Captioner] 20:55:28
CONSIDER THAT IF THAT'S NOT 


[Captioner] 20:55:29
BEING DONE?


[Captioner] 20:55:32
AND THAT WAY, IT SAVES THEM 


[Captioner] 20:55:35
MONEY IN THIS PROCESS, AND 


[Captioner] 20:55:36
ENCOURAGE MORE BUILDING.


[Captioner] 20:55:43
>> David Persselin:   SO I'LL 


[Captioner] 20:55:45
TRY TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION.


[Captioner] 20:55:47
ONE INCENTIVE OR ONE ACTION 


[Captioner] 20:55:50
COUNCIL HAS TAKEN TO TRY TO 


[Captioner] 20:55:51
ASSIST AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS 


[Captioner] 20:55:52
WHEN WE INSTITUTED THE IMPACT 


[Captioner] 20:55:54
FEES FOR DEVELOPMENT, COUNCIL 


[Captioner] 20:55:58
LOWERED THE FEES FOR AFFORDABLE 


[Captioner] 20:56:00
DEVELOPMENTS BY HALF AND THAT'S 


[Captioner] 20:56:03
SAVED CONSIDERABLE AMOUNTS OF 


[Captioner] 20:56:06
MONEY ALREADY, THAT'S ONE BIG 


[Captioner] 20:56:08
ACTION COUNCIL HAS TAKEN.


[Captioner] 20:56:08
MOST AFFORDABLE HOUSING 


[Captioner] 20:56:10
DEVELOPMENTS ARE UNDER VERY 


[Captioner] 20:56:11
TIGHT TIME LINES BECAUSE THEY'RE 


[Captioner] 20:56:13
GETTING FUNDING FROM THE STATE 


[Captioner] 20:56:15
THAT HAS DEADLINES THEY HAVE TO 


[Captioner] 20:56:16
MEET.


[Captioner] 20:56:17
AND WE'VE WORKED VERY CLOSELY 


[Captioner] 20:56:19
WITH OUR AFFORDABLE HOUSING 


[Captioner] 20:56:20
DEVELOPERS TO ENSURE THAT THEY 


[Captioner] 20:56:22
MAKE THOSE DEADLINES.


[Captioner] 20:56:24
AND QUALIFY FOR THAT STATE 


[Captioner] 20:56:24
FUNDING.


[Captioner] 20:56:27
SO WE DON'T HAVE ANY SORT OF, 


[Captioner] 20:56:29
YOU KNOW, TURN AROUND TIME 


[Captioner] 20:56:30
THAT'S SET IN POLICY OR ANYTHING 


[Captioner] 20:56:32
LIKE THAT.


[Captioner] 20:56:34
BUT IT'S OUR PRACTICE TO WORK 


[Captioner] 20:56:38
VERY CLOSELY WITH OUR AFFORDABLE 


[Captioner] 20:56:40
DEVELOPERS TO MAKE SURE OUR 


[Captioner] 20:56:43
PROJECTS MOVE THROUGH THE SYSTEM 


[Captioner] 20:56:45
AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE SO THEY 


[Captioner] 20:56:47
DON'T LOSE THIS IMPORTANT STATE 


[Captioner] 20:56:50
FUNDING THAT THEY QUALIFY FOR.


[Captioner] 20:56:50
>> Vice Mayor Keng:   THANK YOU 


[Captioner] 20:56:51
FOR THAT FEEDBACK.


[Captioner] 20:56:53
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:56:55
I WAS GOING TO NOTE THAT ONE 


[Captioner] 20:56:56
THINGS WE HAVE DONE IN THE PAST 


[Captioner] 20:56:59
IS WE HAVE PULLED OUR FUNDING 


[Captioner] 20:57:01
TOO WHEN IT COMES TO MARKET RATE 


[Captioner] 20:57:02
HOUSING FEES.


[Captioner] 20:57:04
THEREFORE WHEN WE PROVIDED NO 


[Captioner] 20:57:06
NOTICE OF FUNDING AVAILABILITY, 


[Captioner] 20:57:08
THE LAST TIME WAS 42 MILLION, 


[Captioner] 20:57:10
THAT ALLOWED US TO ADDRESS THREE 


[Captioner] 20:57:11
PROJECTS, IF I REMEMBER 


[Captioner] 20:57:14
CORRECTLY, ONE OF THE ONES WAS 


[Captioner] 20:57:17
ON OSGOOD, I'M NOT SURE IF IT'S 


[Captioner] 20:57:18
THAT SPECIFIC ONE.


[Captioner] 20:57:19
DEPENDING ON THE FINANCE IF THE 


[Captioner] 20:57:23
STATE OR FEDERAL CAN GIVE US 


[Captioner] 20:57:27
MORE AFFORDABLE, ONE OF THE 


[Captioner] 20:57:29
PROJECTS DID GET AN AWARD 


[Captioner] 20:57:33
AFTERWARDS.


[Captioner] 20:57:35
>> Dan Schoenholz:  , WE HAVE 


[Captioner] 20:57:36
SECURED TWO GRANTS FROM THE 


[Captioner] 20:57:40
STATE, IN PART BECAUSE OF THE 


[Captioner] 20:57:41
AFFORDABLE HOUSING THRAWRCHED WE 


[Captioner] 20:57:42
SET OUT THAT WE FUND THROUGH 


[Captioner] 20:57:44
FEES ON BOTH COMMERCIAL AND 


[Captioner] 20:57:45
RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT.


[Captioner] 20:57:47
SO WE HAVE THIS REGULAR FUNDING 


[Captioner] 20:57:49
SOURCE AND THE STATE ENCOURAGES 


[Captioner] 20:57:50
THAT BY OFFERING GRANTS TO 


[Captioner] 20:57:52
CITIES THAT DO THAT.


[Captioner] 20:57:56
AND WE'VE QUALIFIED FOR THOSE, 


[Captioner] 20:58:00
SO WE'VE GENERATED LARGE AMOUNTS 


[Captioner] 20:58:01
NOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING, THAT'S 


[Captioner] 20:58:03
WHY OUR NUMBERS ARE SO MUCH 


[Captioner] 20:58:05
HIGHER IN THIS CYCLE IS WE HAVE 


[Captioner] 20:58:06
GENERATED MUCH MORE FUNDING.


[Captioner] 20:58:08
IN ADDITION THERE WAS ALAMEDA 


[Captioner] 20:58:10
COUNTY MEASURE A-1 WHICH WAS 


[Captioner] 20:58:11
ADOPTED BY THE VOTERS THAT 


[Captioner] 20:58:13
PROVIDED ADDITIONAL FUNDING 


[Captioner] 20:58:15
DURING THIS HOUSING ELEMENT 


[Captioner] 20:58:17
CYCLE, SO ALL OF THESE FUNDING 


[Captioner] 20:58:19
SOURCES ARE REALLY CRITICAL IN 


[Captioner] 20:58:21
TERMS OF PRODUCING AFFORDABLE 


[Captioner] 20:58:21
HOUSING.


[Captioner] 20:58:23
>> Mayor Mei:   THERE WAS A 


[Captioner] 20:58:24
DIRECT ALLOCATION ORIGINALLY FOR 


[Captioner] 20:58:27
THE SOUTH COUNTY AND THEN FOR 


[Captioner] 20:58:28
THE SOUTH PART OF THE COUNTY AND 


[Captioner] 20:58:31
THEN WE ALSO TRIED COMPETING FOR 


[Captioner] 20:58:33
ADDITIONAL FUNDING WITHIN THAT.


[Captioner] 20:58:36
CLARIFYING QUESTIONS.


[Captioner] 20:58:36
COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL.


[Captioner] 20:58:37
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:58:40
>> Councilmember Campbell:   


[Captioner] 20:58:40
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:58:43
I JUST HAVE A COUPLE OF QUICK 


[Captioner] 20:58:47
QUESTIONS.


[Captioner] 20:58:50
THE ABOVE-MARKET, I MEAN IT SAYS 


[Captioner] 20:58:53
ABOVE-MODERATE, THAT'S THE 


[Captioner] 20:58:53
MARKET RATE, OKAY.


[Captioner] 20:58:59
AND THEN I WAS JUST LOOKING AT 


[Captioner] 20:59:00
THE REPORT.


[Captioner] 20:59:04
AND I NOTICED THAT SOME PARTS OF 


[Captioner] 20:59:09
THE CITY DOESN'T HAVE 


[Captioner] 20:59:10
REPRESENTATION WHEN IT COMES TO 


[Captioner] 20:59:11
AFFORDABLE HOUSING.


[Captioner] 20:59:13
IS IT JUST BECAUSE IT IS IN THIS 


[Captioner] 20:59:14
CYCLE?


[Captioner] 20:59:16
I'M NOT SEEING ARDENWOOD FOR 


[Captioner] 20:59:18
EXAMPLE ANY UNITS BEING BUILT IN 


[Captioner] 20:59:21
THE NORTHERN PART OF FREMONT.


[Captioner] 20:59:23
I DON'T SEE NILES ON HERE AND I 


[Captioner] 20:59:25
DON'T SEE WARM -- MISSION SAN 


[Captioner] 20:59:26
JOSE.


[Captioner] 20:59:29
SO I'M JUST WONDERING, HOW DO WE 


[Captioner] 20:59:31
DECIDE WHERE WE -- THESE UNITS 


[Captioner] 20:59:33
ARE BEING CREATED?


[Captioner] 20:59:35
AM I -- AM I STILL ON MUTE?


[Captioner] 20:59:37
>> Mayor Mei:   NO, WE CAN HEAR 


[Captioner] 20:59:37
YOU.


[Captioner] 20:59:38
THANK YOU SO MUCH.


[Captioner] 20:59:41
>> Councilmember Campbell:   


[Captioner] 20:59:44
OKAY.


[Captioner] 20:59:45
>> Dan Schoenholz:   SO 


[Captioner] 20:59:48
COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL, 


[Captioner] 20:59:48
AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS 


[Captioner] 20:59:51
THEY HAVE TO SECURE FUNDING FROM 


[Captioner] 20:59:52
MULTIPLE SOURCES.


[Captioner] 20:59:54
THE CITY SUBSIDIZES BE 


[Captioner] 20:59:55
AFFORDABLE HOUSING BUT ALSO 


[Captioner] 20:59:57
THAT'S USUALLY JUST SEED MONEY 


[Captioner] 20:59:59
TO HELP THEM QUALIFY FOR OTHER 


[Captioner] 21:00:00
FUNDING SOURCES AS WELL.


[Captioner] 21:00:02
THOSE FUNDING SOURCES REALLY 


[Captioner] 21:00:04
GIVER PREFERENCE TO DEVELOPMENTS 


[Captioner] 21:00:06
THAT ARE CLOSE TO TRANSIT.


[Captioner] 21:00:09
AND SO WHAT ENDS UP HAPPENING IS 


[Captioner] 21:00:12
THAT OUR TRANSIT ORIENTED AREAS 


[Captioner] 21:00:14
ARE THE ONES THAT ARE THE BEST 


[Captioner] 21:00:15
 


[Captioner] 21:00:16
SITUATED TO QUALIFY FOR FUNDING 


[Captioner] 21:00:17
FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING.


[Captioner] 21:00:19
SO THAT'S WHY YOU SEE MORE OF 


[Captioner] 21:00:20
THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN 


[Captioner] 21:00:23
IRVINGTON AND CENTERVILLE AND IN 


[Captioner] 21:00:24
CENTRAL FREMONT AND NOW IN WARM 


[Captioner] 21:00:25
SPRINGS.


[Captioner] 21:00:26
>> Councilmember Campbell:   


[Captioner] 21:00:26
OKAY, THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 21:00:35
WHAT'S THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN 


[Captioner] 21:00:40
WHAT -- WHEN A DEVELOPER, WHAT 


[Captioner] 21:00:45
DO THEY CALL IT -- YOU SAID THEY -- I'M LOOKING AT -- HOLD 


[Captioner] 21:00:46
ON ONE SECOND.


[Captioner] 21:00:49
I'LL GET MY THOUGHT TOGETHER.


[Captioner] 21:00:54
BECAUSE BUILDING PERMITS, AND 


[Captioner] 21:00:56
ACTUALLY BUILDING THE 


[Captioner] 21:00:58
DEVELOPMENT ITSELF, OR THE UNITS 


[Captioner] 21:00:59
THEMSELVES, WHAT'S THE 


[Captioner] 21:01:01
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE 


[Captioner] 21:01:03
BUILDING PERMITS AND THE 


[Captioner] 21:01:05
ACTUALLY HAVING SOMEONE IN THE 


[Captioner] 21:01:07
HOUSE TO BE ABLE TO DETERMINE 


[Captioner] 21:01:08
WHETHER OR NOT YOU MET YOUR 


[Captioner] 21:01:13
NUMBERS?


[Captioner] 21:01:14
>> ISSUANCE OF BUILDING PERMITS 


[Captioner] 21:01:18
MEANS THAT THE DEVELOPER CAN 


[Captioner] 21:01:19
START CONSTRUCTION AND START 


[Captioner] 21:01:20
BUILDING IT.


[Captioner] 21:01:25
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT WHEN 


[Captioner] 21:01:27
SOMEBODY'S ACTUALLY READY TO 


[Captioner] 21:01:30
MOVE IN, THAT MEANS AFTER THE 


[Captioner] 21:01:32
BUILDING HAS BEEN FINALLED, 


[Captioner] 21:01:33
ISSUED A CERTIFICATE OF 


[Captioner] 21:01:35
OCCUPANCY, IT'S DONE AND MOVE IN 


[Captioner] 21:01:36
READY.


[Captioner] 21:01:37
>> Councilmember Campbell:   SO 


[Captioner] 21:01:39
THE BUILDING PERMITS ARE WHAT 


[Captioner] 21:01:40
DETERMINES WHETHER OR NOT YOU'VE 


[Captioner] 21:01:43
MET YOUR NUMBERS.


[Captioner] 21:01:43
>> THAT'S RIGHT.


[Captioner] 21:01:46
BUILDING PERMIT ISSUANCE IS 


[Captioner] 21:01:49
TYPICALLY THE METRICS THAT'S 


[Captioner] 21:01:54
USED TO -- IN TERMS OF COUNTING 


[Captioner] 21:01:57
YOUR NUMBERS AGAINST RHNA.


[Captioner] 21:01:59
>> Councilmember Campbell:   OH.


[Captioner] 21:02:01
>> WE DO REPORT ON PERMITS 


[Captioner] 21:02:02
FINALLED AS WELL AS NEW 


[Captioner] 21:02:04
APPLICATIONS SUBMITTED AND 


[Captioner] 21:02:06
PROJECTS ENTITLED AS WELL BUT 


[Captioner] 21:02:08
THAT'S A KEY METRIC.


[Captioner] 21:02:08
>> Councilmember Campbell:   


[Captioner] 21:02:09
OKAY, OKAY.


[Captioner] 21:02:11
AND SOME OF THESE THAT WOULD -- 


[Captioner] 21:02:14
ARE CARRYOVERS RIGHTS TO THE NEW 


[Captioner] 21:02:16
14 PLUS THOUSAND THAT WE HAVE TO 


[Captioner] 21:02:16
BUILD?


[Captioner] 21:02:18
I THINK YOU TOLD ME THAT THE 


[Captioner] 21:02:18
LAST TIME.


[Captioner] 21:02:22
THEY ARE CARRYOVERS.


[Captioner] 21:02:23
>> THAT'S RIGHT.


[Captioner] 21:02:29
SOME ARE -- SOME PROJECTS THAT 


[Captioner] 21:02:32
WERE PERMITTED IN 2022 WILL 


[Captioner] 21:02:34
CARRY OVER AND BE COUNTED 


[Captioner] 21:02:36
TOWARDS OUR GOALS IN THE NEXT 


[Captioner] 21:02:37
CYCLE.


[Captioner] 21:02:37
>> Councilmember Campbell:   


[Captioner] 21:02:39
OKAY, OKAY.


[Captioner] 21:02:40
YOU DID TELL ME THAT FROM THE 


[Captioner] 21:02:41
LAST TIME.


[Captioner] 21:02:43
I THINK WHEN WE LOOKED AT THE 


[Captioner] 21:02:45
LAST HOUSING ELEMENT.


[Captioner] 21:02:47
THAT THAT WAS THE CASE, THAT 


[Captioner] 21:02:49
THERE WAS SOME OF THE UNITS THAT 


[Captioner] 21:02:51
WILL GO TOWARDS THE LOW INCOME 


[Captioner] 21:02:53
AND THE VERY LOW INCOME THAT 


[Captioner] 21:02:57
WILL BE CARRIED OVER TO THE 


[Captioner] 21:02:58
NEW -- BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T BEEN 


[Captioner] 21:02:59
DEVELOPED YET.


[Captioner] 21:03:01
>> THAT'S RIGHT.


[Captioner] 21:03:03
>> Councilmember Campbell:   


[Captioner] 21:03:03
OKAY.


[Captioner] 21:03:05
OKAY, OKAY, THAT'S ALL I HAVE 


[Captioner] 21:03:06
FOR NOW.


[Captioner] 21:03:07
THANK YOU SO MUCH.


[Captioner] 21:03:09
>> Mayor Mei:   THANKS.


[Captioner] 21:03:12
NEXT IS COUNCILMEMBER SHAO.


[Captioner] 21:03:14
>> Councilmember Shao:   THANK 


[Captioner] 21:03:15
YOU, MADAM MAYOR.


[Captioner] 21:03:16
THIS QUESTION ACTUALLY IS FOR 


[Captioner] 21:03:17
THE PUBLIC.


[Captioner] 21:03:21
IF WE LOOK AT TABLE 2, THE 


[Captioner] 21:03:25
PERMITS ISSUED, UNDER ALL 


[Captioner] 21:03:28
CATEGORIES, AND THEN I CAN 


[Captioner] 21:03:32
NOTICE A TREND OF ALL THE OTHER 


[Captioner] 21:03:35
CATEGORIES OVER THE 


[Captioner] 21:03:41
ABOVE-MODERATE UNITS, I SEE THAT 


[Captioner] 21:03:45
IN 2016, IT'S ALMOST THE LOWEST 


[Captioner] 21:03:47
CLOSE TO ZERO.


[Captioner] 21:03:51
BUT THEN STARTING 2018, 


[Captioner] 21:03:54
ESPECIALLY AFTER 2020, WE SEE 


[Captioner] 21:03:56
THAT RATIO START TO INCREASE 


[Captioner] 21:03:57
DRAMATICALLY.


[Captioner] 21:04:02
NOW WELL ABOVE 20%, MEANING, IT 


[Captioner] 21:04:04
WAS 100 UNITS OF MODERATE OR 


[Captioner] 21:04:09
ABOVE-MODERATE UNITS, WE HAVE 


[Captioner] 21:04:11
OVER 20 UNITS UNDER OTHER 


[Captioner] 21:04:11
CATEGORIES.


[Captioner] 21:04:16
SO MY QUESTION IS:  FOLLOWING 


[Captioner] 21:04:19
THIS TREND, DO YOU THINK THE 


[Captioner] 21:04:22
COUNCIL'S INCREASE OF IN LIEU 


[Captioner] 21:04:26
FEES ACTUALLY HAD AN IMPACT ON 


[Captioner] 21:04:28
THE INCREASE OF SUCH RATIO, IN 


[Captioner] 21:04:31
OTHER WORDS, RAISING THE IN-LIEU 


[Captioner] 21:04:33
FEES DO YOU THINK IT HELPED THE 


[Captioner] 21:04:38
DEVELOPERS TO BE MORE MOTIVATED 


[Captioner] 21:04:40
TO DEVELOP AFFORDABLE HOUSING?


[Captioner] 21:04:51
>> Dan Schoenholz:   SO IT'S 


[Captioner] 21:04:53
DIFFICULT TO TEASE PART THESE 


[Captioner] 21:04:54
NUMBERS AND SORT OF DETERMINE 


[Captioner] 21:04:55
CAUSE AND EFFECT.


[Captioner] 21:04:57
THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFERENT 


[Captioner] 21:05:01
VARIABLES IN PLAY.


[Captioner] 21:05:04
MY THOUGHT IN PART IS THAT A LOT 


[Captioner] 21:05:05
OF MARKET RATE DEVELOPMENT 


[Captioner] 21:05:10
HAPPENED IN 2015 AND 2016, WE 


[Captioner] 21:05:12
COLLECTED FEES.


[Captioner] 21:05:13
IT TAKES US TIME TO PUSH THAT 


[Captioner] 21:05:16
MONEY OUT TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING 


[Captioner] 21:05:18
DEVELOPERS, AND SO THERE IS SORT 


[Captioner] 21:05:19
OF A LAG TIME.


[Captioner] 21:05:21
SO YOU SEE A LOT OF MARKET RATE 


[Captioner] 21:05:21
DEVELOPMENT HAPPENING.


[Captioner] 21:05:23
AND UNLESS THEY BUILD UNITS 


[Captioner] 21:05:25
WITHIN THEIR DEVELOPMENT 


[Captioner] 21:05:27
INCLUSIONARY HOUSING, THE 


[Captioner] 21:05:28
AFFORDABLE HOUSING KIND OF 


[Captioner] 21:05:31
TRAILS.


[Captioner] 21:05:34
AND SO, YOU KNOW, I WOULD EXPECT 


[Captioner] 21:05:37
TO SEE SORT OF TWO PEAKS.


[Captioner] 21:05:38
ONE WOULD BE THE MARKET RATE 


[Captioner] 21:05:41
PEAK AND THEN A LITTLE BIT LATER 


[Captioner] 21:05:44
WOULD BE THE AFFORDABLE PEAK.


[Captioner] 21:05:45
BUT I DO THINK, YOU KNOW, ALL OF 


[Captioner] 21:05:47
THE THINGS THAT THE COUNCIL HAS 


[Captioner] 21:05:49
BEEN DOING TO TRY TO PROMOTE 


[Captioner] 21:05:50
AFFORDABLE HOUSING I THINK HAVE 


[Captioner] 21:05:54
CONTRIBUTED TO, YOU KNOW, US 


[Captioner] 21:05:56
PRODUCING MORE HOUSING THAN WE 


[Captioner] 21:05:57
HAVE IN THE PAST.


[Captioner] 21:05:59
OBVIOUSLY IT IS ONE OF THESE 


[Captioner] 21:06:02
GLASS IS HALF EMPTY GLASS IS 


[Captioner] 21:06:04
HALF FULL THING BECAUSE WE 


[Captioner] 21:06:05
HAVEN'T MET THE GOALS THAT WERE 


[Captioner] 21:06:07
SET FOR US.


[Captioner] 21:06:08
THAT IS DISAPPOINTING BUT ON THE 


[Captioner] 21:06:09
OTHER HAND, IT IS SOMETHING TO 


[Captioner] 21:06:11
BE PROUD OF THAT WE PRODUCED SO 


[Captioner] 21:06:13
MUCH MORE IN THIS EIGHT YEAR 


[Captioner] 21:06:14
PERIOD THAN WE HAVE IN PREVIOUS 


[Captioner] 21:06:16
EIGHT YEARS.


[Captioner] 21:06:16
>> Councilmember Shao:   THANK 


[Captioner] 21:06:17
YOU.


[Captioner] 21:06:18
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 21:06:21
NEXT, FOR CLARIFYING QUESTIONS, 


[Captioner] 21:06:21
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN.


[Captioner] 21:06:27
>> Councilmember Kassan:   SO 


[Captioner] 21:06:29
ONCE AGAIN, WE'VE BUILT ALMOST 


[Captioner] 21:06:33
FOUR TIMES AS MUCH, OR THE 


[Captioner] 21:06:34
DEVELOPERS HAVE BUILT ALMOST 


[Captioner] 21:06:37
FOUR TIMES AS MUCH MARKET RATE 


[Captioner] 21:06:39
HOUSING AS WAS CALLED FOR IN 


[Captioner] 21:06:43
RHNA BUT ONLY 36% OF THE AMOUNT 


[Captioner] 21:06:44
OF AFFORDABLE WAS BUILT THAT WAS 


[Captioner] 21:06:46
HOPED FOR BY RHNA.


[Captioner] 21:06:48
SO WE -- I KNOW WE'RE GETTING -- 


[Captioner] 21:06:50
THIS IS A LITTLE BIT OFF TOPIC 


[Captioner] 21:06:53
BUT WE'RE GETTING READY TO 


[Captioner] 21:06:54
CONSIDER DEFERRING DEVELOPER 


[Captioner] 21:06:57
FEES, THAT HAS PASSED ON THE 


[Captioner] 21:06:58
FIRST READING AND IT IS COMING 


[Captioner] 21:07:00
BACK FOR A SECOND REELD READING.


[Captioner] 21:07:04
AND I'M JUST WONDERING, GIVEN 


[Captioner] 21:07:09
THAT EVERY SINGLE RHNA CYCLE WE 


[Captioner] 21:07:12
ARE COMPLETELY UNDERPERFORMING 


[Captioner] 21:07:17
WHEN IT COMES TO NUMBERS.


[Captioner] 21:07:23
DO YOU THINK DELAYING DEVELOPER 


[Captioner] 21:07:25
FEES WILL GIVE AN IMPACT ON OUR 


[Captioner] 21:07:27
ABILITY TO PRODUCE AFFORDABLE 


[Captioner] 21:07:29
HOUSING?


[Captioner] 21:07:30
>> Dan Schoenholz:   SO I THINK 


[Captioner] 21:07:32
WHEN WE TALKED ABOUT THE FEE 


[Captioner] 21:07:38
DEFERRAL, I THINK STAFF, OUR 


[Captioner] 21:07:41
VIEW IS THAT IT'S ALSO HARD TO 


[Captioner] 21:07:43
PREDICT EXACTLY WHAT THE IMPACTS 


[Captioner] 21:07:46
OF THE FEE DEFERRAL ARE.


[Captioner] 21:07:49
ON THE ONE HAND, IT DELAYS THE 


[Captioner] 21:07:52
TIME WHEN WE COLLECT THE FUNDS, 


[Captioner] 21:07:55
SO THAT OBVIOUSLY WILL DELAY 


[Captioner] 21:07:57
WHEN WE CAN USE THAT MONEY TO 


[Captioner] 21:07:58
BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING.


[Captioner] 21:08:01
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND, IT COULD 


[Captioner] 21:08:03
MAKE SOME MARKET RATE PROJECTS 


[Captioner] 21:08:04
PENCIL THAT WOULDN'T OTHERWISE.


[Captioner] 21:08:06
AND SO WE MAY COLLECT MORE FEES 


[Captioner] 21:08:08
THAN WE WOULD OTHERWISE.


[Captioner] 21:08:10
AND WE CAN'T, AGAIN, YOU KNOW, 


[Captioner] 21:08:12
REALLY SHOW CAUSE AND EFFECT.


[Captioner] 21:08:14
SO I THINK THOSE ARE THE, YOU 


[Captioner] 21:08:17
KNOW, KIND OF THE, YOU KNOW, THE 


[Captioner] 21:08:22
TWO COMPETING COMPONENTS OF 


[Captioner] 21:08:24
REINSTATING THE FEE DEFERRAL.


[Captioner] 21:08:28
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 21:08:32
NEXT FOR CLARIFYING QUESTIONS.


[Captioner] 21:08:34
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN.


[Captioner] 21:08:34
>> Councilmember Salwan:   THANK 


[Captioner] 21:08:35
YOU MADAM MAYOR AND THANK YOU 


[Captioner] 21:08:37
FOR THE WONDERFUL PRESENTATION.


[Captioner] 21:08:38
JUST A QUESTION.


[Captioner] 21:08:41
AS FAR AS THE ABOVE MODERATE 


[Captioner] 21:08:43
UNITS, HOW MANY OF THOSE ARE 


[Captioner] 21:08:44
FROM THE WARM SPRINGS 


[Captioner] 21:08:45
DEVELOPMENT?


[Captioner] 21:08:52
>> PROBABLY 3500 I THINK.


[Captioner] 21:08:55
SOMEWHERE IN THAT RANGE.


[Captioner] 21:08:56
>> Councilmember Salwan:   3500 


[Captioner] 21:08:57
OKAY.


[Captioner] 21:08:59
SO IF WE TOOK THOSE OUT, THEN WE 


[Captioner] 21:09:02
WOULD BE WITHIN THE RHNA NUMBERS 


[Captioner] 21:09:05
THEN, WE TAKE OUT THAT ONE-TIME 


[Captioner] 21:09:06
TOD AREA?


[Captioner] 21:09:10
>> I'M SORRY COULD YOU REPEAT 


[Captioner] 21:09:12
THE QUESTION?


[Captioner] 21:09:12
>> Councilmember Salwan:   SO 


[Captioner] 21:09:15
TOTAL UNITS TO DATE ARE 8223.


[Captioner] 21:09:19
AND YOU SAID 3500 WERE, IF I CAN 


[Captioner] 21:09:23
DO SOME QUICK MATH MYSELF HERE.


[Captioner] 21:09:26
SO 8223, 3500, SO THAT WOULD 


[Captioner] 21:09:30
GIVE US IN A NORMAL YEAR OF 


[Captioner] 21:09:30
4723.


[Captioner] 21:09:32
WHICH WOULD BE BELOW THE RHNA 


[Captioner] 21:09:35
GOALS FOR THIS PERIOD UP TO 
2022.


[Captioner] 21:09:37
IF WE WERE TO --


[Captioner] 21:09:42
>> IF WE EXCLUDED WARM SPRINGS, 


[Captioner] 21:09:43
THAT'S CORRECT.


[Captioner] 21:09:43
>> Councilmember Salwan:   THE 


[Captioner] 21:09:46
REASON I SAID THAT, THAT IS ONCE 


[Captioner] 21:09:48
IN A GENERATIONAL TYPE PROJECT, 


[Captioner] 21:09:51
I DON'T THINK WE WILL HAVE 


[Captioner] 21:09:51
ANOTHER WARM SPRINGS BECAUSE WE 


[Captioner] 21:09:53
DON'T HAVE THAT KIND OF LAND.


[Captioner] 21:09:55
SO I JUST WANTED TO, YOU KNOW, 


[Captioner] 21:09:55
UNDERSTAND THAT.


[Captioner] 21:09:59
SECOND, THESE RHNA NUMBERS ARE 


[Captioner] 21:10:05
THEY MAXIMUMS OR MINIMUMS, CAN 


[Captioner] 21:10:08
YOU DO TOO MUCH OR ARE THESE THE 


[Captioner] 21:10:08
MINIMUM GUIDELINES THAT THE 


[Captioner] 21:10:10
STATE IS LOOKING FOR?


[Captioner] 21:10:11
>> THOSE ARE OUR TARGETS.


[Captioner] 21:10:14
SO IT WOULD BE -- THERE IS NO 


[Captioner] 21:10:15
MAXIMUM NUMBER OF UNITS YOU 


[Captioner] 21:10:16
WOULD BUILD.


[Captioner] 21:10:18
THOSE ARE THE NUMBERS YOU'RE 


[Captioner] 21:10:22
STRIVING FOR IN ORDER TO MEET 


[Captioner] 21:10:23
YOUR HOUSING NEEDS.


[Captioner] 21:10:23
>> Councilmember Salwan:   OKAY.


[Captioner] 21:10:25
AND DO WE KNOW HOW MUCH IN LIEU 


[Captioner] 21:10:27
FEES WE COLLECTED FROM THESE 


[Captioner] 21:10:29
PROJECTS THAT WE WERE ABLE TO 


[Captioner] 21:10:30
USE MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING?


[Captioner] 21:10:38
>> Dan Schoenholz:   WE 


[Captioner] 21:10:40
PRESENTED THOSE NUMBERS WHEN WE 


[Captioner] 21:10:45
PRESENTED OUR DEFERRALS, IT'S 


[Captioner] 21:10:46
SIGNIFICANT SO WE PUSHED OUT 


[Captioner] 21:10:48
TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS I 


[Captioner] 21:10:50
THINK THAT THE MAYOR WAS STATING 


[Captioner] 21:10:52
THAT --


[Captioner] 21:10:54
>> Mayor Mei:   42 PLUS THE 


[Captioner] 21:10:55
PREVIOUS ROUNDS.


[Captioner] 21:10:56
THERE WERE A COUPLE OF ROUNDS OF 


[Captioner] 21:10:58
NOFA FUDGED.


[Captioner] 21:11:03
THE LAST ONE, I AM TRYING TO 


[Captioner] 21:11:04
THINK OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD, 


[Captioner] 21:11:05
IT'S 30 PERHAPS?


[Captioner] 21:11:07
I KNOW IT'S SIGNIFICANT.


[Captioner] 21:11:09
I KNOW WE HAVE DONE MULTIPLE 


[Captioner] 21:11:10
PROJECTS TO GET TO THAT POINT.


[Captioner] 21:11:11
>> Councilmember Salwan:   THANK 


[Captioner] 21:11:12
YOU.


[Captioner] 21:11:14
LAST CURIOSITY QUESTION, OUR 


[Captioner] 21:11:16
HOUSING ELEMENT DID WE GET 


[Captioner] 21:11:18
APPROVED FOR THE 2023 CYCLE OR 


[Captioner] 21:11:21
IS THAT STILL IN THE APPLIANCE?


[Captioner] 21:11:24
>> WE EXPECT TO HEAR BACK 


[Captioner] 21:11:26
SOMETIME IN THE NEXT WEEK.


[Captioner] 21:11:26
>> Councilmember Salwan:   


[Captioner] 21:11:27
EXCELLENT.


[Captioner] 21:11:28
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 21:11:29
>> Mayor Mei:   NEXT FOR 


[Captioner] 21:11:31
CLARIFYING QUESTIONS, 


[Captioner] 21:11:32
COUNCILMEMBER COX.


[Captioner] 21:11:32
>> Councilmember Cox:   THANK 


[Captioner] 21:11:33
YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR 


[Captioner] 21:11:33
PRESENTATION.


[Captioner] 21:11:37
AND ALL THIS INFORMATION.


[Captioner] 21:11:38
I WAS CURIOUS, I NOTICED THAT 


[Captioner] 21:11:42
YOU DID QUITE A FEW, A COUPLE OF 


[Captioner] 21:11:43
TRAININGS WITH DIFFERENT GROUPS.


[Captioner] 21:11:46
AND I WAS CURIOUS TO FIND OUT IN 


[Captioner] 21:11:50
TERMS OF THE APARTMENT OWNERS 


[Captioner] 21:11:52
AND PROPERTY MANAGERS.


[Captioner] 21:11:53
WHAT WERE SOME OF THE BARRIERS 


[Captioner] 21:11:55
THEY WERE SAYING, IN DOING 


[Captioner] 21:11:57
BUSINESS WITH FREMONT?


[Captioner] 21:12:00
AND EVEN WITH THE DEVELOPERS 


[Captioner] 21:12:01
AND, YOU KNOW, IS THERE SOME 


[Captioner] 21:12:02
WAYS THAT WE COULD HELP 


[Captioner] 21:12:04
STREAMLINE THE PROCESS BETTER, 


[Captioner] 21:12:08
TO HELP SERVICE OUR RESIDENTS 


[Captioner] 21:12:13
AND SERVICE OUR FUTURE PROPERTY 


[Captioner] 21:12:14
OWNERS OR RENTERS?


[Captioner] 21:12:26
>> Dan Schoenholz:   SO THE 


[Captioner] 21:12:32
WORKSHOP FOR PROPERTY MANAGERS 


[Captioner] 21:12:37
WAS SPECIFIC TO FAIR HOUSING 


[Captioner] 21:12:39
ISSUES, I THINK -- I THINK WE'RE 


[Captioner] 21:12:40
TALKING ABOUT THE SAME ONE THAT 


[Captioner] 21:12:41
YOU'RE ASKING ABOUT.


[Captioner] 21:12:44
AND SO I THINK IT WAS, YOU KNOW, 


[Captioner] 21:12:47
STAFF AND CONSULTANTS THAT ARE 


[Captioner] 21:12:48
KIND OF EXPERT IN THE AREA OF 


[Captioner] 21:12:51
FAIR HOUSING PROVIDING GUIDANCE 


[Captioner] 21:12:52
TO PROPERTY OWNERS.


[Captioner] 21:12:54
SO IT WAS KIND OF A WORKSHOP AND 


[Captioner] 21:12:55
A CLASS ALMOST.


[Captioner] 21:12:59
I'M NOT SURE WHAT COMMENTS CAME 


[Captioner] 21:13:01
BACK DURING THAT.


[Captioner] 21:13:03
BUT I THINK IT WAS REALLY MEANT 


[Captioner] 21:13:06
AS KIND OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE 


[Captioner] 21:13:08
TO PROPERTY MANAGERS.


[Captioner] 21:13:09
>> Councilmember Cox:   OKAY SO 


[Captioner] 21:13:11
YOU'RE KIND OF LIKE GIVING THEM 


[Captioner] 21:13:13
THE RESOURCES AND WHAT THINGS 


[Captioner] 21:13:15
ARE REFERENCED AND OPERATIONS 


[Captioner] 21:13:17
AND THINGS LIKE THAT.


[Captioner] 21:13:18
>> Dan Schoenholz:   RIGHT.


[Captioner] 21:13:19
>> Councilmember Cox:   I WAS 


[Captioner] 21:13:20
JUST CURIOUS IF THERE WAS ANY 


[Captioner] 21:13:22
WAY WE COULD HELP IMPROVE OUR 


[Captioner] 21:13:23
PROCESS WITH EVERYONE.


[Captioner] 21:13:26
BECAUSE I KNOW -- I THINK FOR 


[Captioner] 21:13:27
THE WHOLE PERMIT PROCESS IT 


[Captioner] 21:13:30
COULD TAKE UP TO LIKE FIVE YEARS 


[Captioner] 21:13:32
UNTIL YOU GOT THE TIME OF 


[Captioner] 21:13:34
OCCUPANCY, IS THAT ABOUT RIGHT 


[Captioner] 21:13:36
ON AVERAGE NOW OR HAS THAT GONE 


[Captioner] 21:13:37
UP MORE?


[Captioner] 21:13:37
>> Dan Schoenholz:   YES.


[Captioner] 21:13:39
SO THE PERMITTING PROCESS YOU'RE 


[Captioner] 21:13:43
TALKING ABOUT FOR DEVELOPING?


[Captioner] 21:13:45
DEVELOPING HOUSING --


[Captioner] 21:13:46
>> Councilmember Cox:   AND 


[Captioner] 21:13:48
SOMEBODY IS ABLE TO BASICALLY 


[Captioner] 21:13:50
MOVE IN ONCE THEY GOT THE 


[Captioner] 21:13:51
OCCUPANCY ISSUED, THE 


[Captioner] 21:13:52
CERTIFICATE.


[Captioner] 21:13:54
>> Dan Schoenholz:   YES, SO I 


[Captioner] 21:13:56
MEAN WE'RE CONSTANTLY STRIVING 


[Captioner] 21:13:57
TO IMPROVE OUR PERMIT PROCESS.


[Captioner] 21:13:59
YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY DURING COVID 


[Captioner] 21:14:01
IT WAS VERY CHALLENGING WHEN WE 


[Captioner] 21:14:02
COULDN'T MEET IN PERSON AND 


[Captioner] 21:14:05
WE'VE DONE A MAJOR PIVOT TO 


[Captioner] 21:14:07
DOING PRIMARILY ONLINE 


[Captioner] 21:14:07
PERMITTING.


[Captioner] 21:14:10
AND THAT HAS PROVEN TO BE 


[Captioner] 21:14:12
POPULAR WITH OUR -- ESPECIALLY 


[Captioner] 21:14:14
WITH OUR LARGER DEVELOPERS WHO, 


[Captioner] 21:14:16
YOU KNOW, KIND OF GET FAMILIAR 


[Captioner] 21:14:19
WITH THE SYSTEM AND IT MAKES IT 


[Captioner] 21:14:21
MUCH EASIER FOR THEM.


[Captioner] 21:14:22
THEY CAN USE IT 24 HOURS A DAY 


[Captioner] 21:14:25
AND THEY CAN TRACK WHERE THEIR 


[Captioner] 21:14:26
PROJECT IS THROUGH THE SYSTEM 


[Captioner] 21:14:27
AND ALL THAT.


[Captioner] 21:14:32
SO THAT'S AN EXAMPLE OF SORT OF 


[Captioner] 21:14:34
A TECHNOLOGICALLY IMPROVEMENT WE 


[Captioner] 21:14:38
 TECHNOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENT WE 


[Captioner] 21:14:39
PUT IN PLACE.


[Captioner] 21:14:41
I MENTIONED SPECIFICALLY ON 


[Captioner] 21:14:43
AFFORDABLE HOUSING WE PUT A LOT 


[Captioner] 21:14:45
OF EFFORT INTO ENSURING THAT THE 


[Captioner] 21:14:46
PROJECTS GET THROUGH QUICKLY AND 


[Captioner] 21:14:48
MEET THE DEADLINES THAT THE 


[Captioner] 21:14:50
STATE HAS SET.


[Captioner] 21:14:50
>> Councilmember Cox:   BECAUSE 


[Captioner] 21:14:54
THEY'LL LOSE THE FUNDING, IT'S A 


[Captioner] 21:14:55
TIGHT TIME LINE THERE.


[Captioner] 21:14:57
BUT IS THAT LIKE, YOU KNOW, 


[Captioner] 21:14:59
HOW -- IT'S THE RANGE IS FIVE 


[Captioner] 21:15:01
YEARS BUT FOR AFFORDABLE 


[Captioner] 21:15:05
HOUSING, IS IT -- HOW MUCH 


[Captioner] 21:15:06
SHORTER?


[Captioner] 21:15:07
>> Dan Schoenholz:   NO, IT -- 


[Captioner] 21:15:10
SO FOR AN AFFORDABLE PROJECT IT 


[Captioner] 21:15:12
COULD BE SIX TO EIGHT MONTHS TO 


[Captioner] 21:15:13
GO FROM THEIR APPLICATION TO 


[Captioner] 21:15:14
THEIR PERMIT.


[Captioner] 21:15:15
>> Councilmember Cox:   OKAY, 


[Captioner] 21:15:15
GOT IT.


[Captioner] 21:15:18
>> Dan Schoenholz:   YES.


[Captioner] 21:15:19
>> Councilmember Cox:   THAT 


[Captioner] 21:15:22
GIVES ME -- THAT'S FAST.


[Captioner] 21:15:23
>> Dan Schoenholz:   SORT OF A 


[Captioner] 21:15:26
MORE TYPICAL TIME IF WE'RE NOTE 


[Captioner] 21:15:28
THROWING KIND OF EXTRA RESOURCES 


[Captioner] 21:15:30
AT IT IS PROBABLY MORE AROUND A 


[Captioner] 21:15:33
YEAR FOR BIG MULTIFAMILY 


[Captioner] 21:15:33
PROJECT.


[Captioner] 21:15:34
>> Councilmember Cox:   SURE, 


[Captioner] 21:15:36
EASILY, YEAH, OKAY, THAT SOUNDS 


[Captioner] 21:15:37
ABOUT RIGHT FROM WHAT MY 


[Captioner] 21:15:38
EXPERIENCE.


[Captioner] 21:15:41
I WANTED TO ALSO FIND OUT, I WAS 


[Captioner] 21:15:43
REALLY GLAD TO SEE THAT WE DID A 


[Captioner] 21:15:45
SEMINAR ON THE ADU AND PROBABLY 


[Captioner] 21:15:47
GENERATED A LOT OF INTEREST 


[Captioner] 21:15:48
THERE.


[Captioner] 21:15:50
AND I GUESS THAT ALSO HELPED 


[Captioner] 21:15:52
WHEN THE LAW PASSED THAT IT 


[Captioner] 21:15:55
INCREASED.


[Captioner] 21:15:57
BUT, YOU KNOW, HOW MANY PROJECTS 


[Captioner] 21:15:59
ON AVERAGE DO WE HAVE RIGHT NOW 


[Captioner] 21:16:01
FOR ADU UNITS?


[Captioner] 21:16:08
>> WE PERMITTED 149 LAST YEAR.


[Captioner] 21:16:10
WHICH IS A CONSIDERABLE INCREASE 


[Captioner] 21:16:12
FROM EVEN THE YEAR PRIOR.


[Captioner] 21:16:16
I THINK IT'S -- I THINK IT WAS 


[Captioner] 21:16:18
LIKE A FIVE TIMES INCREASE SINCE 


[Captioner] 21:16:19
2018.


[Captioner] 21:16:20
SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE TREND 


[Captioner] 21:16:23
IS GOING TO BE BEYOND THIS YEAR.


[Captioner] 21:16:26
BUT IT'S -- THERE IS A LOT OF 


[Captioner] 21:16:28
ACTIVITY AROUND ADUs AT THE 


[Captioner] 21:16:30
MOMENT.


[Captioner] 21:16:31
>> Councilmember Cox:   AND SOME 


[Captioner] 21:16:34
ARE USED FOR ALSO THE AFFORDABLE 


[Captioner] 21:16:35
HOUSING ASPECT OF IT, HOW SOME 


[Captioner] 21:16:37
OF THEM ARE BEING DESIGNED.


[Captioner] 21:16:39
>> I THINK ADUs IN GENERAL ARE 


[Captioner] 21:16:40
SMALL UNITS.


[Captioner] 21:16:42
AND I THINK FROM OUR EXPERIENCE 


[Captioner] 21:16:45
WE KNOW THAT BY VIRTUE OF BEING 


[Captioner] 21:16:47
A SMALLER UNIT THEY'RE GOING TO 


[Captioner] 21:16:49
BE MORE AFFORDABLE.


[Captioner] 21:16:55
AND ABAG DID A REGIONAL STUDY ON 


[Captioner] 21:16:57
RENTAL RATES FOR ADUs AND THEY 


[Captioner] 21:17:00
FOUND ABOUT 90% OF ADUs ON 


[Captioner] 21:17:02
AVERAGE WERE BEING RENTED AT 


[Captioner] 21:17:04
RATES AFFORDABLE TO LOWER INCOME 


[Captioner] 21:17:07
OR MODERATE INCOME HOUSEHOLDS.


[Captioner] 21:17:08
>> Councilmember Cox:   OKAY, 


[Captioner] 21:17:09
THAT GIVES ME A GOOD METRIC 


[Captioner] 21:17:10
THERE.


[Captioner] 21:17:11
THAT WAS VERY HELPFUL.


[Captioner] 21:17:13
AND GOOD JOB ESPECIALLY ON 


[Captioner] 21:17:16
OUTREACHING AND ALL THOSE 


[Captioner] 21:17:17
DIFFERENT TRAINING THAT HELPED 


[Captioner] 21:17:19
THINGS GO SMOOTHER AND PROVIDING 


[Captioner] 21:17:21
THE RESOURCES, SO THANK YOU VERY 


[Captioner] 21:17:21
MUCH.


[Captioner] 21:17:25
>> Mayor Mei:   NEXT, DO WE HAVE -- I WANT TO OPEN UP THE 


[Captioner] 21:17:27
PUBLIC HEARING.


[Captioner] 21:17:28
>> The Clerk:   WE CURRENTLY 


[Captioner] 21:17:30
HAVE ONE ON ZOOM.


[Captioner] 21:17:31
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 21:17:40
>> The Clerk:   NARIN IMADI.


[Captioner] 21:17:41
>> HELLO EVERYONE.


[Captioner] 21:17:45
THIS IS NARIN IMADI, I'M A 


[Captioner] 21:17:47
RESIDENT OF TREATMENT LIVING IN 


[Captioner] 21:17:48
CANYON HEIGHTS NEIGHBORHOOD.


[Captioner] 21:17:49
SO THANK YOU, THANK YOU VERY 


[Captioner] 21:17:50
MUCH.


[Captioner] 21:17:53
FOR PROVIDING THIS REPORT.


[Captioner] 21:17:58
IT'S PRETTY GOOD, AND VERY 


[Captioner] 21:17:59
DETAILED AND INFORMATIVE.


[Captioner] 21:18:02
SO -- BUT AT THE SAME TIME I 


[Captioner] 21:18:04
WOULD LIKE TO JUST POINT OUT 


[Captioner] 21:18:05
LIKE, YOU KNOW, A FEW THINGS.


[Captioner] 21:18:07
WE ALSO HAVE TO LOOK AT THIS IN 


[Captioner] 21:18:08
A DIFFERENT WAY.


[Captioner] 21:18:11
LIKE, YOU KNOW, WE ARE -- 


[Captioner] 21:18:13
DEFINITELY HAVE OVERALL NUMBERS 


[Captioner] 21:18:16
THAT WERE THE PERMITS THAT WE 


[Captioner] 21:18:18
ISSUED EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE 


[Captioner] 21:18:21
LIKE 8,000 PLUS FOR THE ENTIRE 


[Captioner] 21:18:23
EIGHT YEAR TENURE, ON THE LOW, 


[Captioner] 21:18:25
VERY LOW INCOME, AFFORDABLE 


[Captioner] 21:18:28
HOUSING WE ONLY MET 40%.


[Captioner] 21:18:31
ON LOW INCOME IT'S 55% ON 


[Captioner] 21:18:34
MODERATE INCOME IT'S 9%.


[Captioner] 21:18:39
AND ON THE ABOVE NOT RAD INCOME 


[Captioner] 21:18:41
WE MET LIKE 400%.


[Captioner] 21:18:44
SO THERE IS EVEN THOUGH ALL THE 


[Captioner] 21:18:46
NUMBERS SEEMS GREAT THERE IS A 


[Captioner] 21:18:48
LOT THAT NEED TO BE DONE, 


[Captioner] 21:18:49
ESPECIALLY ON THE LOW INCOME, 


[Captioner] 21:18:51
VERY LOW INCOME AND MODERATE 


[Captioner] 21:18:52
INCOME.


[Captioner] 21:18:53
WE SHOULD TAKE THIS AS A 


[Captioner] 21:18:55
PROBABLY A LEARNING AND THEN 


[Captioner] 21:18:58
COULD DO BETTER IN THE NEXT 


[Captioner] 21:18:59
EIGHT-YEAR TENURE.


[Captioner] 21:19:05
AND ALSO, THERE ARE SOME OF THE 


[Captioner] 21:19:07
QUESTIONS LIKE FROM THE COUNCIL 


[Captioner] 21:19:09
ARE GREAT.


[Captioner] 21:19:11
ESPECIALLY GIVEN THIS LAST TWO, 


[Captioner] 21:19:15
THREE YEARS SPIKE IN THE OVERALL 


[Captioner] 21:19:15
NUMBERS.


[Captioner] 21:19:19
THEY MAY NOT BE SUSTAINED FOR 


[Captioner] 21:19:20
THE NEXT FEW YEARS.


[Captioner] 21:19:22
IN THAT CASE LIKE IT WILL BE 


[Captioner] 21:19:27
GREAT IF WE CONTINUED THE GOING, 


[Captioner] 21:19:32
AND THE NUMBERS WOULD CONTINUE 


[Captioner] 21:19:34
CONTINUOUSLY WITH THE SAME RAPID 


[Captioner] 21:19:34
RATE.


[Captioner] 21:19:38
AND THE OSGOOD HOUSING PROJECT 


[Captioner] 21:19:40
AND ALLEN HOUSING PROJECT 


[Captioner] 21:19:42

APR'S.


[Captioner] 21:19:50

[Captioner] 21:21:23
THE MOTION CARRIES.


[Captioner] 21:21:23
AND IT'S APPROVED.


[Captioner] 21:21:28
I JUST WANTED TO MAKE A QUICK 


[Captioner] 21:21:29
COMMENT TOO, JUST FOR SOME OF 


[Captioner] 21:21:30
THE PEOPLE THAT ASKED THE 


[Captioner] 21:21:31
QUESTION.


[Captioner] 21:21:32
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE 


[Captioner] 21:21:33
STARTED OFF THE CONVERSATION WAS 


[Captioner] 21:21:35
ABOUT THE GENERAL PLAN.


[Captioner] 21:21:37
AND ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE 


[Captioner] 21:21:38
ARE SEEING CERTAIN TYPES OF 


[Captioner] 21:21:41
HOUSING BUILT IT ALIGNS WITH THE 


[Captioner] 21:21:43
GENERAL PLAN AND APPROVED LAND 


[Captioner] 21:21:43
USE.


[Captioner] 21:21:44
ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WE HAVE 


[Captioner] 21:21:47
AND THAT IS SOMETHING WE COULD 


[Captioner] 21:21:48
ALWAYS WORK ON COLLECTIVELY AS A 


[Captioner] 21:21:51
BODY IS LEGISLATIVE POLICIES OR 


[Captioner] 21:21:52
FUNDING PROGRAMS THAT 


[Captioner] 21:21:54
SPECIFICALLY TARGET SOME OF THE 


[Captioner] 21:21:55
DIFFERENT PROGRAMS THAT WE WANT 


[Captioner] 21:21:57
TO ACHIEVE IN TERMS OF IN THE 


[Captioner] 21:21:59
PAST WE'VE HAD SOME SUPPORT AND 


[Captioner] 21:22:01
TARGETED FUNDING PROGRAMS 


[Captioner] 21:22:02
SPECIFICALLY TO AFFORDABLE 


[Captioner] 21:22:04
HOUSING LIKE MEASURE A.


[Captioner] 21:22:07
BUT WE'VE HAD A STRUGGLE WITH 


[Captioner] 21:22:08
SOME OF THE MODERATE WORKFORCE 


[Captioner] 21:22:08
HOUSING.


[Captioner] 21:22:10
THE OTHER THING IS THAT WE -- I 


[Captioner] 21:22:14
WANT TO THANK OUR STAFF IN 


[Captioner] 21:22:19
REFERENCE TO THE ADUS, PEOPLE 


[Captioner] 21:22:22
CAME BECAUSE IF IT IS A MORE 


[Captioner] 21:22:24
SIMPLIFIED PROCESS THAT HELPS 


[Captioner] 21:22:26
FACILITATE A SMOOTHER APPROVAL 


[Captioner] 21:22:28
AND LESS COMPLICATIONS IT HELPS 


[Captioner] 21:22:32
US TO EXPEDITE SOME OF THE ADU 


[Captioner] 21:22:33
HOUSING.


[Captioner] 21:22:35
THAT'S SOMETHING I WANT TO THANK 


[Captioner] 21:22:36
THE STAFF FOR.


[Captioner] 21:22:39
WITH REGARD TO THE TRAINING FOR 


[Captioner] 21:22:40
TENANTS AND LANDLORDS, ONE OF 


[Captioner] 21:22:42
THE THINGS WE UTILIZED IT FOR 


[Captioner] 21:22:44
REAL QUICKLY WAS ALSO FOR THE 


[Captioner] 21:22:45
RENTAL ASSISTANCE AND SOME OF 


[Captioner] 21:22:47
THE OTHER PROGRAMS TO HELP 


[Captioner] 21:22:49
FACILITATE AND FAST-TRACK THAT.


[Captioner] 21:22:51
I WANT TO THANK OUR STAFF BOTH 


[Captioner] 21:22:52
FROM THE PLANNING SIDE AS WELL 


[Captioner] 21:22:54
AS THE HUMAN SERVICES SIDE FOR 


[Captioner] 21:22:55
PARTNERING TO GET THAT DONE.


[Captioner] 21:22:57
SO THAT'S THE HOUSING ELEMENT.


[Captioner] 21:22:58
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 21:23:05
NEXT ON THIS AGENDA IS ITEM 7A 


[Captioner] 21:23:08
WHICH IS THE COUNCIL REFERRAL 


[Captioner] 21:23:11
FROM CITY COUNCIL FOR, FROM 


[Captioner] 21:23:11
COUNCILMEMBER COX.


[Captioner] 21:23:23
SCR THANK YOU VERY MUCH, MAYOR.


[Captioner] 21:23:25
WITH MUCH THOUGHT I'VE BEEN 


[Captioner] 21:23:27
THINKING ABOUT THIS 


[Captioner] 21:23:28
MULTICULTURAL CELEBRATIONS AND 


[Captioner] 21:23:30
FESTIVAL FOR A LONG TIME.


[Captioner] 21:23:32
AND IN FACT, I HAD TALKED ABOUT 


[Captioner] 21:23:37
IT WITH MY PASTOR, PASTOR TERRY, 


[Captioner] 21:23:39
THAT YOU SAW EARLIER FROM HARBOR 


[Captioner] 21:23:39
LIGHT.


[Captioner] 21:23:42
AND JUST TRYING TO REACH HOW WE 


[Captioner] 21:23:44
CAN MAKE THINGS MORE EQUITABLE 


[Captioner] 21:23:45
FOR EVERYONE AND THE RESIDENTS 


[Captioner] 21:23:46
HERE IN FREMONT.


[Captioner] 21:23:49
BECAUSE WHEN WE LOOK AT IT SOME 


[Captioner] 21:23:50
GROUPS ARE LARGER THAN OTHERS.


[Captioner] 21:23:52
AND WHEN YOU HAVE NUMBERS, 


[Captioner] 21:23:54
SOMETIMES YOU HAVE MORE MONEY, 


[Captioner] 21:23:56
MORE ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT.


[Captioner] 21:23:57
AND THAT RESTRICTS OTHER GROUPS 


[Captioner] 21:23:59
THAT WOULD NOT NECESSARILY BE 


[Captioner] 21:24:03
ABLE TO PROVIDE THE SAME LEVEL 


[Captioner] 21:24:05
OF CELEBRATIONS.


[Captioner] 21:24:08
I KNOW THAT ALL OF US HERE ARE 


[Captioner] 21:24:10
IN SUPPORT OF OUR FLAG POLICY, 


[Captioner] 21:24:12
THAT IS COMING ABOUT.


[Captioner] 21:24:16
AND ALSO, THE PROCLAMATIONS TO 


[Captioner] 21:24:17
HONOR THE DIFFERENT OCCASIONS 


[Captioner] 21:24:20
THAT OCCUR WITHIN OUR COMMUNITY, 


[Captioner] 21:24:22
WHICH SUPPORT THE WORK THAT OUR 


[Captioner] 21:24:25
RESIDENTS ARE DOING AND CITY 


[Captioner] 21:24:26
STAFF.


[Captioner] 21:24:29
AND I THINK WHAT THIS PURPOSE OF 


[Captioner] 21:24:32
THE MULTICULTURAL CELEBRATIONS, 


[Captioner] 21:24:34
IT WAS BASICALLY TO ALLOW THE 


[Captioner] 21:24:36
DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS HERE IN 


[Captioner] 21:24:38
FREMONT, THE ETHNIC GROUPS, THE 


[Captioner] 21:24:41
DIVERSITY THAT WE ALL HAVE AND 


[Captioner] 21:24:43
THAT WE WANT TO ENCOURAGE 


[Captioner] 21:24:46
FRIENDSHIP, NEIGHBORLY RELATIONS 


[Captioner] 21:24:47
BUT ALSO A LEVEL OF 


[Captioner] 21:24:48
UNDERSTANDING OF COMMON 


[Captioner] 21:24:50
INTERESTS AND SOME THINGS THAT 


[Captioner] 21:24:51
MAKE US ALL DIFFERENT AND UNIQUE 


[Captioner] 21:24:54
TO BE ABLE TO EXPRESS THAT.


[Captioner] 21:24:57
AND IN ADDITION, WE KNOW THAT 


[Captioner] 21:24:59
WITH SOME OF THE PREVIOUS, IN 


[Captioner] 21:25:02
THE PAST, WE'D PASSED YOU KNOW 


[Captioner] 21:25:04
PROMOTING ZERO TOLERANCE OF ANY 


[Captioner] 21:25:07
KIND OF DISCRIMINATION, RACISM, 


[Captioner] 21:25:09
SEXISM OR HATRED IN THE 


[Captioner] 21:25:09
COMMUNITY.


[Captioner] 21:25:12
SO THE PURPOSE REALLY OF THE 


[Captioner] 21:25:14
MULTICULTURE CELEBRATION IS TO 


[Captioner] 21:25:16
ALLOW US TO COME TOGETHER AND 


[Captioner] 21:25:17
HAVE THE CITY OF FREMONT AS ALL 


[Captioner] 21:25:19
OF US ARE LEADERS HERE TO BE 


[Captioner] 21:25:21
ABLE TO PROVIDE A VENUE, A 


[Captioner] 21:25:22
PLATFORM THAT WOULD ALLOW THE 


[Captioner] 21:25:26
DIVERSITY OF ALL THESE DIFFERENT 


[Captioner] 21:25:27
GROUPS AND FAMILIES AND 


[Captioner] 21:25:28
COMMUNITIES THAT LIVE HERE IN 


[Captioner] 21:25:30
FREMONT, THAT WE CAN BE ABLE TO 


[Captioner] 21:25:33
COME TOGETHER AND CELEBRATE.


[Captioner] 21:25:39
AND ALSO, THAT IN MARCH OF 2022, 


[Captioner] 21:25:42
I SEE OUR DIRECTOR SUZANNE WOLF 


[Captioner] 21:25:44
HAD PRESENTED BEFORE US AND WE 


[Captioner] 21:25:47
HAD A COUPLE OF READINGS BUT WE 


[Captioner] 21:25:49
ALL PREVIOUSLY ACCEPT ONE 


[Captioner] 21:25:51
COUNCILMEMBER, WE APPROVED THE 


[Captioner] 21:25:54
PARK RECREATION MASTER PLAN.


[Captioner] 21:25:57
AND IN IT, IT WAS EXTENSIVE, AND 


[Captioner] 21:25:59
WITH THE CONSULTING FIRMS THAT 


[Captioner] 21:26:03
WORKED WITH OUR CITY STAFF, THE 


[Captioner] 21:26:06
RESIDENTS, OVER 3,000 RESIDENTS 


[Captioner] 21:26:09
EXPRESSED THAT THEY WANTED TO 


[Captioner] 21:26:11
HAVE FREE COMMUNITY EVENTS, FREE 


[Captioner] 21:26:13
CULTURAL, AND SO THIS IS 


[Captioner] 21:26:16
SOMETHING THAT IS VERY POWERFUL, 


[Captioner] 21:26:18
THAT IT WAS COMING OUT OF THIS 


[Captioner] 21:26:21
PARTICULAR PLAN, THAT THE 


[Captioner] 21:26:22
RESEARCH WAS THERE.


[Captioner] 21:26:25
IT DOCUMENTED OVER 200 UNIQUE 


[Captioner] 21:26:26
COMMUNITY LEADERS, LOCAL 


[Captioner] 21:26:29
BUSINESSES, LOCAL SERVICE 


[Captioner] 21:26:31
ORGANIZATIONS, ALL OF OUR, YOU 


[Captioner] 21:26:32
KNOW, DIFFERENT CITY 


[Captioner] 21:26:34
COMMISSIONERS THAT ALLOWED TO BE 


[Captioner] 21:26:37
ABLE TO SPEAK, EVEN OUR 


[Captioner] 21:26:38
SPIRITUAL AND FAITH BASED 


[Captioner] 21:26:41
LEADERS WERE EVEN TAPPED IN TO 


[Captioner] 21:26:42
GET THEIR INPUT.


[Captioner] 21:26:44
SO IT IS SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN 


[Captioner] 21:26:46
DOCUMENTED IN THE SURVEYS WITH 


[Captioner] 21:26:48
WHAT THE RESIDENTS OF FREMONT 


[Captioner] 21:26:49
WOULD LIKE TO SEE.


[Captioner] 21:26:53
AND AS WE TAKE A LOOK, THERE IS 


[Captioner] 21:26:56
A LOT OF CITIES IN CALIFORNIA, 


[Captioner] 21:26:57
NORTHERN CALIFORNIA IN 


[Captioner] 21:27:00
PARTICULAR, THAT HOLD THEIR 


[Captioner] 21:27:02
ANNUAL MULTICULTURE FESTIVAL.


[Captioner] 21:27:04
AND I KNOW IN TALKING WITH OTHER 


[Captioner] 21:27:09
MEMBERS OF OTHER CITY LEADERS, 


[Captioner] 21:27:11
I.T. WAS A WAY TO BRING THE 


[Captioner] 21:27:12
COMMUNITY TOGETHER AND NOT PUT 


[Captioner] 21:27:14
ONE COMMUNITY OVER ANOTHER.


[Captioner] 21:27:17
BUT TO HAVE EVERYONE BE ABLE TO 


[Captioner] 21:27:22
EXPRESS WHAT MAKES EACH THREAD 


[Captioner] 21:27:24
AND VIBRANT COMMUNITY SO UNIQUE.


[Captioner] 21:27:27
SO YOU LOOK AT CONCORD.


[Captioner] 21:27:29
THEY HAVE A MULTIFESTIVAL.


[Captioner] 21:27:30
SAN JOSE.


[Captioner] 21:27:32
MOUNTAIN VIEW, ANTIOCH, YOU 


[Captioner] 21:27:37
KNOW, WE HAVE A LOT OF ARTESIA 


[Captioner] 21:27:40
DOWN IN ORANGE COUNTY AND YOU 


[Captioner] 21:27:42
KNOW OAK GROVE ALL IN THE STATE 


[Captioner] 21:27:44
OF CALIFORNIA, NOT TO MENTION 


[Captioner] 21:27:47
SAN DIEGO, AND EVEN WHEN I HAD 


[Captioner] 21:27:50
EVEN LIVED ON THE EAST COAST, 


[Captioner] 21:27:54
EVEN WITH THE ANNUAL FESTIVAL IN 


[Captioner] 21:27:56
NEW YORK CITY AT JACKIE ROBINSON 


[Captioner] 21:27:58
PARK WHICH I USED TO SUSTAINED 


[Captioner] 21:27:59
BACK IN THE DAY.


[Captioner] 21:28:00
BUT ALL THESE ARE RESONATING 


[Captioner] 21:28:02
THAT THIS IS THE WAY THE TREND 


[Captioner] 21:28:05
BUT ALSO THE LEVEL OF THE 


[Captioner] 21:28:07
RESIDENTS BEING ABLE TO 


[Captioner] 21:28:11
CELEBRATE THE MULTICULTURE 


[Captioner] 21:28:13
FESTIVALS, SO IT IS HELD IN A 


[Captioner] 21:28:14
WIDE VARIETY OF CITIES.


[Captioner] 21:28:16
I JUST NAMED A FEW AND NOT TO 


[Captioner] 21:28:18
SAY I DIDN'T LIST ALL OF THEM 


[Captioner] 21:28:19
BUT THEY'RE THERE IN THE REPORT.


[Captioner] 21:28:21
BUT THE GENERAL CONCEPT IS 


[Captioner] 21:28:21
SIMPLE.


[Captioner] 21:28:26
IS THAT WE WOULD HAVE THE EVENT, 


[Captioner] 21:28:32
AKA, AS KNOWN AS FREMONT 


[Captioner] 21:28:33
MULTICULTURAL FESTIVAL, AND WE 


[Captioner] 21:28:35
WOULD BE CELEBRATING IT AS A 


[Captioner] 21:28:36
COMMUNITY EVENT THIS WOULD ALLOW 


[Captioner] 21:28:39
THE DIFFERENT GROUPS TO PROVIDE 


[Captioner] 21:28:41
EITHER ARTS, ENTERTAINMENT, YOU 


[Captioner] 21:28:44
HAVE RESOURCE FAIR, YOU COULD 


[Captioner] 21:28:49
ALSO HAVE AVENUES FOR FOOD 


[Captioner] 21:28:50
TRUCKS, INFORMATION TO THE 


[Captioner] 21:28:54
COMMUNITY, AND IT WOULD BE KIND 


[Captioner] 21:28:55
OF ON A DIFFERENT, YOU KNOW, 


[Captioner] 21:28:58
KIND OF TIME SCALE THAT THERE 


[Captioner] 21:29:00
WOULD BE DIFFERENT ALLOTTED 


[Captioner] 21:29:03
TIMES TO HAVE THESE DIFFERENT 


[Captioner] 21:29:04
ACTIVITIES OF THE CULTURAL 


[Captioner] 21:29:05
ENTERTAINMENT.


[Captioner] 21:29:07
BUT ALSO IT'S PROVIDING 


[Captioner] 21:29:09
INFORMATION, YOU KNOW, IN OUR 


[Captioner] 21:29:11
COMMUNITY WE'VE HAD TO DEAL WITH 


[Captioner] 21:29:14
THOSE LOOKING FOR KIDNEY AND 


[Captioner] 21:29:17
BONE MARROW TRANSPLANT AND THOSE 


[Captioner] 21:29:19
TYPE OF INFORMATION COULD ALSO 


[Captioner] 21:29:22
BE PART OF THE CULTURAL 


[Captioner] 21:29:23
CELEBRATION AND THE INFORMATION 


[Captioner] 21:29:24
RESOURCE BOOTH.


[Captioner] 21:29:26
AND WE HAVE SO MANY WONDERFUL 


[Captioner] 21:29:28
HOSPITALS TO HELP REDUCE OUR 


[Captioner] 21:29:30
HEALTH INEQUALITIES.


[Captioner] 21:29:32
SO, YOU KNOW, IN LOOKING OUT AND 


[Captioner] 21:29:34
THIS WOULD BE SOMETHING, NOT NOW 


[Captioner] 21:29:37
BECAUSE WE NEED TIME TO PLAN.


[Captioner] 21:29:40
AND HAVE OUR CITY STAFF TAKE A 


[Captioner] 21:29:41
LOOK AT IT.


[Captioner] 21:29:43
BUT WE'RE LOOKING AT A TARGETED 


[Captioner] 21:29:45
DATE OF MAY 2024.


[Captioner] 21:29:48
AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT, WE ALSO 


[Captioner] 21:29:51
KIND OF TOOK A LOOK AND KIND OF 


[Captioner] 21:29:53
SURVEYED LIKE WHAT WOULD BE THE 


[Captioner] 21:29:55
BEST MONTH TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A 


[Captioner] 21:29:57
MULTICULTURAL EVENT?


[Captioner] 21:30:00
AND BASED ON THE RESEARCH IN THE 


[Captioner] 21:30:02
MONTH OF MAY WE HAVE SO MANY 


[Captioner] 21:30:03
WONDERFUL THINGS.


[Captioner] 21:30:07
WE HAVE THE AAPI HERITAGE MONTH, 


[Captioner] 21:30:08
ASIAN AMERICAN PACIFIC ISLANDER, 


[Captioner] 21:30:12
YOU HAVE CINCO DE MAYO, YOU HAVE 


[Captioner] 21:30:16
JEWISH AMERICAN MONTH, YOU HAVE 


[Captioner] 21:30:20
JEWISH AMERICAN DAY, IT COVERS 


[Captioner] 21:30:28
HAWAII, INDIA, CHINA, AFGHAN, 


[Captioner] 21:30:30
PAKISTAN, WE HAVE NATIVE 


[Captioner] 21:30:32
AMERICAN DAY, WE HAVE SISTER 


[Captioner] 21:30:34
CITIZENS DAY, WORLD DAY FOR 


[Captioner] 21:30:34
CULTURAL DIVERSITY.


[Captioner] 21:30:36
NOT TO MENTION WE HAVE MOTHERS 


[Captioner] 21:30:38
DAY IN THE MONTH OF MAY.


[Captioner] 21:30:40
SO IT'S KIND OF A LITTLE BIT OF 


[Captioner] 21:30:41
EVERYTHING FOR EVERYBODY.


[Captioner] 21:30:43
IT WOULD KIND OF RESONATE.


[Captioner] 21:30:46
AND EVEN THERE'S AN AFRICAN 


[Captioner] 21:30:49
LIBERATION DAY, MALL COME X 


[Captioner] 21:30:51
BIRTHDAY IS IN THE MONTH OF MAY.


[Captioner] 21:30:53
WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT IT'S KIND OF 


[Captioner] 21:30:55
PIN POITED EVERYTHING LANDED 


[Captioner] 21:30:57
TOGETHER IN THE MONTH OF MAY.


[Captioner] 21:30:59
WE EVEN HAVE THE SIKH COMMUNITY, 


[Captioner] 21:31:03
INTERNATIONAL DAY AGAINST 


[Captioner] 21:31:09
AGAINST HOMOPHOBIA, BIPHOBIA, 


[Captioner] 21:31:15
MEMORIAL DAY, HONORING VETERANS, 


[Captioner] 21:31:17
AND OUR CITY MANAGER'S BIRTHDAY, 


[Captioner] 21:31:21
WHAT DAY WAS THAT DITTO THAT, 


[Captioner] 21:31:23
(LAUGHING).


[Captioner] 21:31:26
PAIFL IN SUMMARY I FEEL LIKE 


[Captioner] 21:31:30
BRINGING FORWARD THIS FESTIVAL 


[Captioner] 21:31:32
WOULD BRING TOGETHER IN THE 


[Captioner] 21:31:34
RICHNESS OF OUR CULTURE HAVE 


[Captioner] 21:31:35
UNITY AND DIVERSITY.


[Captioner] 21:31:37
WE TALK ABOUT THAT, WE ARE DOING 


[Captioner] 21:31:40
PAPER BUT WE NEED TO DO SOME 


[Captioner] 21:31:42
ACTION AND TAKE ACTION TO MAKE 


[Captioner] 21:31:43
THINGS HAPPEN AND TO HELP OUR 


[Captioner] 21:31:44
COMMUNITY.


[Captioner] 21:31:45
AND I THINK THAT THIS WOULD 


[Captioner] 21:31:47
BRING OUR COMMUNITY MUCH MORE 


[Captioner] 21:31:48
TOGETHER AND THIS WOULD BE 


[Captioner] 21:31:50
RECOMMITTING SOME OF THE IDEALS.


[Captioner] 21:31:51
WE TALK ABOUT DIVERSITY.


[Captioner] 21:31:53
WE TALK ABOUT EQUITY AND 


[Captioner] 21:31:53
INCLUSION.


[Captioner] 21:31:55
NOW IT'S TIME TO TAKE ACTION.


[Captioner] 21:31:57
AND I THINK THIS WOULD BE 


[Captioner] 21:31:58
SOMETHING THAT WE COULD CARRY 


[Captioner] 21:32:00
OUT THROUGH FREMONT TO MAKE IT A 


[Captioner] 21:32:02
BETTER, EVEN MORE BETTER 


[Captioner] 21:32:03
COMMUNITY, FOR EVERYONE.


[Captioner] 21:32:05
AND SO WHAT I'M ASKING, THIS IS 


[Captioner] 21:32:12
MY ASK:  IS TO ALLOW CITY STAFF 


[Captioner] 21:32:14
TO PUT TOGETHER A PLAN TO HOST 


[Captioner] 21:32:17
THIS ANNUAL MULTICULTURAL 


[Captioner] 21:32:20
FESTIVAL, LOOKING AT IT AS THE 


[Captioner] 21:32:21
FREMONT DOWNTOWN CENTER WHICH IS 


[Captioner] 21:32:24
OUR HEART AND SOUL, OF OUR 


[Captioner] 21:32:27
CHOOUNT.


[Captioner] 21:32:29
AND WITH THE PLAN THEY CAN 


[Captioner] 21:32:33
PROVIDE STAFFING, RESOURCES, 


[Captioner] 21:32:35
WITH THE BUDGET SUGGEST 


[Captioner] 21:32:40
PERFORMANCE AND ACTIVITIES, AND 


[Captioner] 21:32:42
REACH OUT TO DIFFERENT 


[Captioner] 21:32:43
COMMUNITIES TO GET INPUT ON 


[Captioner] 21:32:45
POSSIBILITIES OF THESE 


[Captioner] 21:32:46
PERFORMANCE AND ACTIVITIES.


[Captioner] 21:32:47
AND ALSO KIND OF LOOKING AT IT 


[Captioner] 21:32:49
AS A COMMUNITY PARTNER 


[Captioner] 21:32:52
SPONSORSHIP, OUR PUBLIC-PRIVATE 


[Captioner] 21:32:54
PARTNERSHIP, AND THIS COULD BE 


[Captioner] 21:32:56
SOMETHING ENGAGING WITH OUR 


[Captioner] 21:32:57
FREMONT CHAMBER AND OUR 


[Captioner] 21:32:59
BUSINESSES AND KIND OF GO ACROSS 


[Captioner] 21:33:01
ALL OF -- ALL THE THINGS THAT 


[Captioner] 21:33:03
LINK US TOGETHER WITH THE CITY 


[Captioner] 21:33:06
OF FREMONT AND OUR RESIDENTS.


[Captioner] 21:33:08
AND ALSO THAT LOOKING AT IT IN 


[Captioner] 21:33:10
TERMS OF THE KIND OF THE LAYOUT 


[Captioner] 21:33:13
AND TRYING TO GET AN IDEA IN 


[Captioner] 21:33:14
TERMS OF THE CULTURAL, 


[Captioner] 21:33:16
INFORMATION, RESOURCE BOOTHS, 


[Captioner] 21:33:19
COMMUNITY OUTREACH AND EVENT 


[Captioner] 21:33:21
MANAGEMENT AND TIME LINE.


[Captioner] 21:33:22
SO THIS WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT 


[Captioner] 21:33:24
THE STAFF COULD TAKE A LOOK AT.


[Captioner] 21:33:26
YOU KNOW WE DO THE -- EVERY YEAR 


[Captioner] 21:33:28
WE HAVE A WONDERFUL CONCERT 


[Captioner] 21:33:30
SERIES EVERY YEAR AND MAYBE THAT 


[Captioner] 21:33:31
COULD BE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT 


[Captioner] 21:33:33
COULD BE REPLACED IN DOING A 


[Captioner] 21:33:35
MULTICULTURAL.


[Captioner] 21:33:36
I MEAN I THINK WE HAVE FIVE OR 


[Captioner] 21:33:38
SIX, I CAN'T REMEMBER HOW MANY 


[Captioner] 21:33:40
CONCERTS, IT'S WONDERFUL FROM 


[Captioner] 21:33:41
JULY TO AUGUST.


[Captioner] 21:33:42
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT COULD BE 


[Captioner] 21:33:44
LIKE A SUBSTITUTE, YOU DO THIS 


[Captioner] 21:33:46
BUT MAYBE SUBSTITUTE IT WITH 


[Captioner] 21:33:50
DOING A MULTICULTURAL FESTIVAL.


[Captioner] 21:33:52
AND GIVE STAFF TIME THAT WE'RE 


[Captioner] 21:33:54
NOT RUSHING, THEY HAVE TIME TO 


[Captioner] 21:33:57
PUT THINGS TOGETHER, AND KIND OF 


[Captioner] 21:33:58
BUILD OUT A PLAN.


[Captioner] 21:34:01
AND MAYBE TALK TO EACH ONE OF US 


[Captioner] 21:34:04
AS SOME INPUT ON THIS 


[Captioner] 21:34:05
MULTICULTURAL.


[Captioner] 21:34:07
AND THEN BE ABLE TO PROVIDE A 


[Captioner] 21:34:09
DEVELOPED PLAN AT A FUTURE DATE 


[Captioner] 21:34:12
BEFORE CITY COUNCIL.


[Captioner] 21:34:14
AND SEIZE WHAT THOUGHTS AND 


[Captioner] 21:34:16
IDEAS -- AND SEE WHAT THOUGHTS 


[Captioner] 21:34:19
AND IDEAS THAT WE CAN DO YOU 


[Captioner] 21:34:21
KNOW, A LOT OF PEOPLE ENJOY OUR 


[Captioner] 21:34:21
CONCERT SERIES.


[Captioner] 21:34:23
THEY ENJOY THE -- YOU KNOW, 


[Captioner] 21:34:24
THERE ARE SO MANY DIFFERENT 


[Captioner] 21:34:26
FAIRS AND, YOU KNOW, SUMMER 


[Captioner] 21:34:28
RECRUITING AND ALL THE DIFFERENT 


[Captioner] 21:34:28
THINGS.


[Captioner] 21:34:30
AND THIS COULD KIND OF HELP TIE 


[Captioner] 21:34:32
THE STRINGS OF FREMONT WITH OUR 


[Captioner] 21:34:33
DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES.


[Captioner] 21:34:38
AND BE MORE UNITED AND MORE 


[Captioner] 21:34:39
AFFABLE THAT EVERYONE WOULD HAVE 


[Captioner] 21:34:42
A FAIR CHANCE AND BE ABLE TO 


[Captioner] 21:34:45
HAVE SHARING IN WHAT MAKES EACH 


[Captioner] 21:34:47
ONE OF OUR DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES 


[Captioner] 21:34:48
AND THREADS DIFFERENT.


[Captioner] 21:34:51
AND I THINK IT'S ALSO 


[Captioner] 21:34:53
EDUCATIONAL, YOU KNOW AND 


[Captioner] 21:34:54
AWARENESS.


[Captioner] 21:34:56
AND THEN ALSO UNDERSTANDING AND 


[Captioner] 21:34:58
LOOKING AT EVEN THE DIFFERENT 


[Captioner] 21:34:59
FOOD TYPES AND ENJOYING THAT AND 


[Captioner] 21:35:00
HAVING THAT EXPLAINED.


[Captioner] 21:35:02
SO THERE IS JUST SO MANY 


[Captioner] 21:35:03
DIFFERENT THINGS THAT COULD COME 


[Captioner] 21:35:05
ABOUT IN THIS PART.


[Captioner] 21:35:06
BUT CALLING IT UNDER THE 


[Captioner] 21:35:10
UMBRELLA OF FREMONT'S 


[Captioner] 21:35:10
MULTICULTURAL FESTIVAL.


[Captioner] 21:35:13

[Captioner] 21:35:51
RESIDENTS ARE IN FREMONT, 


[Captioner] 21:35:54
GATEWAY SEMINARY IN FREMONT.


[Captioner] 21:35:56
LIKE TO CONGRATULATE 


[Captioner] 21:35:58
COUNCILMEMBER TERESA COX AGAIN 


[Captioner] 21:36:00
FOR BECOMING THE FIRST AFRICAN 


[Captioner] 21:36:02
AMERICAN TO SERVE AS THE FREMONT 


[Captioner] 21:36:04
VICE MAYOR IN NEARLY 70 YEARS.


[Captioner] 21:36:06
I BELIEVE HER PROPOSAL OF THE 


[Captioner] 21:36:09
ANNUAL MULTICULTURAL FESTIVAL IS 


[Captioner] 21:36:10
AN EXCELLENT IDEA.


[Captioner] 21:36:13
I CAN HELP DEMONSTRATE THE 


[Captioner] 21:36:15
DIVERSITY OF THIS CITY IN A VERY 


[Captioner] 21:36:16
TANGIBLE KIND OF WAY AND 


[Captioner] 21:36:20
CULTIVATE UNITED AMONG DIFFERENT 


[Captioner] 21:36:21
ETHNIC COMMUNITIES.


[Captioner] 21:36:23
LET ME RELAY ANALOGOUS 


[Captioner] 21:36:24
EXPERIENCE.


[Captioner] 21:36:26
CROSS POINT CHURCH HOSTED AN 


[Captioner] 21:36:36
EVENT AT THE HONG KONG CARNIVAL.


[Captioner] 21:36:38
IT FEATURED FOOD, MERCHANDISE, 


[Captioner] 21:36:41
BOOTHS, AS WELL AS TABLES FOR 


[Captioner] 21:36:44
ORGANIZATIONAL PROMOTIONS SUCH 


[Captioner] 21:36:46
AS CHINESE LANGUAGE SCHOOL, 


[Captioner] 21:36:50
MARTIAL ARTS CENTER, ET CETERA.


[Captioner] 21:36:53
THE EVENT ATTRACTED NEARLY 6,000 


[Captioner] 21:36:54
VISITORS, NEARLY 40 


[Captioner] 21:36:56
ORGANIZATIONS WERE REPRESENTED.


[Captioner] 21:36:58
THE HONG KONG CARNIVAL SERVED 


[Captioner] 21:37:01
NOT ONLY AS A CONDUIT FOR PEOPLE 


[Captioner] 21:37:02
COMING ORIGINALLY FROM HONG KONG 


[Captioner] 21:37:03
TO CONNECT.


[Captioner] 21:37:08
IT ALSO DRAWS MILPITAS RESIDENT, 


[Captioner] 21:37:09
TO COME AND ENJOY AND LEARN.


[Captioner] 21:37:11
INDEED AMONG OUR GUESTS IN 


[Captioner] 21:37:13
OPENING CEREMONY WERE THE MAYOR 


[Captioner] 21:37:14
AND THE VICE MAYOR.


[Captioner] 21:37:18
SO I BELIEVE IF CULTURAL 


[Captioner] 21:37:20
FESTIVAL FOR A SINGLE CULTURE IN 


[Captioner] 21:37:22
MILPITAS CAN DRAW SUCH A BIG 


[Captioner] 21:37:25
CROWD, HOW MUCH MORE CAN A 


[Captioner] 21:37:26
MULTICULTURAL FESTIVAL IN 


[Captioner] 21:37:27
FREMONT DO?


[Captioner] 21:37:29
SO I'M CONFIDENT ALL THE ETHNIC 


[Captioner] 21:37:30
COMMUNITIES WILL BE 


[Captioner] 21:37:32
ENTHUSIASTICALLY SUPPORTIVE OF 


[Captioner] 21:37:33
SUCH AN EVENT.

[Captioner] 21:38:32
FAITH TRADITIONS WITHIN OUR

COMMUNITY WHICH INSPIRE AND 


[Captioner] 21:38:36
TEACH US TO SUPPORT AND LOVE ONE 


[Captioner] 21:38:40
ANOTHER MORE FULLY AND ANY

EFFORTS BY THE CITY TO ALSO DO 


[Captioner] 21:38:47

I'M CLOSING THE PUBLIC COMMENT 


[Captioner] 21:39:16
ON THIS ITEM.


[Captioner] 21:39:18
COUNCILMEMBER SHAO.


[Captioner] 21:39:24
>> Councilmember Shao: THANK 


[Captioner] 21:39:24
YOU, MADAM MAYOR.


[Captioner] 21:39:28
I APPRECIATE THE REFERRAL MADE 


[Captioner] 21:39:32
BY COUNCILMEMBER NOW VICE MAYOR 


[Captioner] 21:39:33
TERESA COX.


[Captioner] 21:39:35
I BELIEVE HER INTENTION IS VERY 


[Captioner] 21:39:36
GOOD.


[Captioner] 21:39:39
I JUST HAVE TO EXPRESS SOME OF 


[Captioner] 21:39:41
MY CONCERNS REGARDING THE 


[Captioner] 21:39:43
UNEXPECTED CONSEQUENCES, FOR 


[Captioner] 21:39:45
EXAMPLE, THE LIMITATION OF 


[Captioner] 21:39:48
FINANCIAL AND MANPOWER RESOURCES 


[Captioner] 21:39:50
THE CITY IS FACING RIGHT NOW.


[Captioner] 21:39:53
WE DON'T HAVE ANY BUDGET FOR 


[Captioner] 21:39:54
SUCH AN EVENT.


[Captioner] 21:39:58
AND ALSO, WITH THE STAFF.


[Captioner] 21:40:01
I BELIEVE WITH THE CURRENT RATIO 


[Captioner] 21:40:03
OF OUR STAFF OVER THE POPULATION 


[Captioner] 21:40:06
OF THE CITY, WE ARE ACTUALLY ONE 


[Captioner] 21:40:09
OF THE LOWEST CITIES IN THE BAY 


[Captioner] 21:40:11
AREA.


[Captioner] 21:40:14
AND THE STAFF HAVE BEEN WORKING 


[Captioner] 21:40:17
VERY HARD ON THE PRIORITIES SET 


[Captioner] 21:40:21
BY THE ANNUAL RETREAT OF THE 


[Captioner] 21:40:24
COUNCILMEMBERS.


[Captioner] 21:40:31
ALSO, I HAVE TO BRING TO -- 


[Captioner] 21:40:34
BRING, YOU KNOW, THE FACT TO THE 


[Captioner] 21:40:37
PUBLIC THAT ACTUALLY IF YOU ARE 


[Captioner] 21:40:39
LOOKING AT ALL THE EVENTS THAT 


[Captioner] 21:40:41
ARE HELD OVER THE YEARS, WE 


[Captioner] 21:40:45
ALREADY HAVE MAJOR EVENTS SUCH 


[Captioner] 21:40:48
AS, YOU KNOW, THE INDIAN DAY 


[Captioner] 21:40:51
PARADE, IN AUGUST, AND ALSO, THE 


[Captioner] 21:40:54
CITY SPONSORED ART FESTIVAL, 


[Captioner] 21:40:57
MORE LIKE A REGIONAL LIKE OLIVE 


[Captioner] 21:41:00
FESTIVAL IN MISSION AREA, AS 


[Captioner] 21:41:03
WELL AS MANY OTHER EVENTS 


[Captioner] 21:41:05
SPONSORED OR PARTIALLY SPONSORED 


[Captioner] 21:41:07
BY THE CITY.


[Captioner] 21:41:09
FOR EXAMPLE, THE NILES ANTIQUE 


[Captioner] 21:41:12
SHOW AND SO ON.


[Captioner] 21:41:16
AND WE ALSO HAVE EVENTS THAT ARE 


[Captioner] 21:41:18
COMPLETELY SPONSORED BY 


[Captioner] 21:41:20
DIFFERENT COMMUNITY GROUPS.


[Captioner] 21:41:24
FOR EXAMPLE, THE RECENT LUNAR 


[Captioner] 21:41:25
NEW YEAR CELEBRATION SPONSORED 


[Captioner] 21:41:28
BY DIFFERENT GROUPS.


[Captioner] 21:41:31
IN THE PAST WE HAVE THE ONE 


[Captioner] 21:41:34
WORLD CONCERT.


[Captioner] 21:41:35
>> Mayor Mei:   THAT WAS IN 


[Captioner] 21:41:37
AUGUST OF 2018.


[Captioner] 21:41:38
>> Councilmember Shao:   YES, 


[Captioner] 21:41:39
AUGUST OF 2018.


[Captioner] 21:41:41
AND I BELIEVE THAT WAS -- CAME 


[Captioner] 21:41:44
OUT OF THE IDEA OF MAYOR MEI AND 


[Captioner] 21:41:47
I BELIEVE MAYOR MEI ACTUALLY 


[Captioner] 21:41:48
SPONSORED IT.


[Captioner] 21:41:50
>> Mayor Mei:   I PAID FOR IT, 


[Captioner] 21:41:51
YEAH.


[Captioner] 21:41:52
>> Councilmember Shao:   SO SUCH 


[Captioner] 21:41:56
EVENTS IS INTENDED TO PROMOTE 


[Captioner] 21:42:01
THE CELEBRATION OF MULTICULTURE.


[Captioner] 21:42:02
AND IT IS INDEED OPEN TO 


[Captioner] 21:42:05
EVERYONE.


[Captioner] 21:42:08
AS I AM AWARE, THIS YEAR THERE'S 


[Captioner] 21:42:11
GOING TO BE THE SECOND ONE WORLD 


[Captioner] 21:42:12
CONCERT.


[Captioner] 21:42:15
AND THE ORGANIZERS HAVE ALREADY 


[Captioner] 21:42:18
SUBMITTED THE APPLICATION TO THE 


[Captioner] 21:42:20
CITY TWO MONTHS AGO.


[Captioner] 21:42:23
AND THE ORGANIZERS ALREADY SENT 


[Captioner] 21:42:26
OUT MESSAGES TO ALL ETHNIC, 


[Captioner] 21:42:29
CULTURAL GROUPS, CLAIMING THAT 


[Captioner] 21:42:32
THIS EVENT IS TO CELEBRATE THE 


[Captioner] 21:42:37
MULTICULTURAL COMMUNITY, AND 


[Captioner] 21:42:39
OPEN TO EVERYONE.


[Captioner] 21:42:42
SO I BELIEVE AS THE CITY WE 


[Captioner] 21:42:44
ENCOURAGE MORE AND MORE 


[Captioner] 21:42:47
ENGAGEMENT FROM THE COMMUNITY 


[Captioner] 21:42:49
RATHER THAN JUST DOING 


[Captioner] 21:42:52
EVERYTHING AND TRYING TO JUST 


[Captioner] 21:42:54
PAYING FOR EVERYTHING.


[Captioner] 21:42:57
ALSO, YOU KNOW, REPLACING ONE OF 


[Captioner] 21:43:00
THE EXISTING AND SUCCESSFUL 


[Captioner] 21:43:01
EVENTS SUCH AS THE SUMMER 


[Captioner] 21:43:06
CONCERTS, MIGHT NOT BE 


[Captioner] 21:43:07
PRODUCTIVE.


[Captioner] 21:43:09
BECAUSE AS FAR AS I FLO, A LOT 


[Captioner] 21:43:12
OF PEOPLE -- AS FAR AS I KNOW A 


[Captioner] 21:43:15
LOT OF PEOPLE REALLY ENJOY THE 


[Captioner] 21:43:17
SERIES OF SUMMER CONCERTS IN 


[Captioner] 21:43:18
CENTRAL PARK.


[Captioner] 21:43:22
I BELIEVE THAT WHILE WE PROUDLY 


[Captioner] 21:43:25
CELEBRATE THE DIVERSITY OF OUR 


[Captioner] 21:43:27
COMMUNITIES, WE CAN ENCOURAGE 


[Captioner] 21:43:30
ALL THE COMMUNITY GROUPS TO 


[Captioner] 21:43:33
CONTINUE TO BE MORE OPEN TO ALL 


[Captioner] 21:43:35
CULTURES AND ALL ETHNIC 


[Captioner] 21:43:38
BACKGROUNDS, WHEN THEY HOLD SUCH 


[Captioner] 21:43:39
EVENTS.


[Captioner] 21:43:41
AND I'M VERY GLAD THAT THEY ARE 


[Captioner] 21:43:43
NOT EXCLUSIVE, YOU KNOW, TO THIS 


[Captioner] 21:43:46
IDEA.


[Captioner] 21:43:48
FURTHERMORE, FOR THE EXISTING 


[Captioner] 21:43:50
PROGRAMS, FOR EXAMPLE, THE ART 


[Captioner] 21:43:54
FESTIVAL, I BELIEVE IT'S 


[Captioner] 21:43:56
REFLECTING THE ARTS FROM ALL 


[Captioner] 21:43:58
CULTURAL BACKGROUNDS.


[Captioner] 21:44:01
AND IT IS ALREADY VERY 


[Captioner] 21:44:03
SUCCESSFUL AND A POPULAR EVENT.


[Captioner] 21:44:06
NOT ONLY IN FREMONT BUT IT 


[Captioner] 21:44:10
ATTRACTS A LOT OF VISITORS FROM 


[Captioner] 21:44:12
RECALL OVER THE BAY AREA.


[Captioner] 21:44:16
SO WITH THAT IN MIND, I THINK WE 


[Captioner] 21:44:20
DO NOT NEED THE CITY STAFF TO 


[Captioner] 21:44:24
SPEND EXTRA MONEY AND MANPOWER 


[Captioner] 21:44:26
SUCH AN ADDITIONAL SO-CALLED 


[Captioner] 21:44:28
MULTICULTURAL FESTIVAL.


[Captioner] 21:44:32
RATHER, WE CAN, AS I SAID, 


[Captioner] 21:44:34
ENCOURAGE ALL THE COMMUNITY 


[Captioner] 21:44:40
GROUPS TO FURTHER CELEBRATE THE 


[Captioner] 21:44:42
MULTICULTURAL COMMUNITIES IN 


[Captioner] 21:44:46
FREMONT IN THEIR OWN EVENTS.


[Captioner] 21:44:52
AND SO THAT WE CAN JUST AVOID 


[Captioner] 21:45:00
ADDITIONAL INCURRING OF EXPENSE 


[Captioner] 21:45:01
AND STAFF TIME.


[Captioner] 21:45:02
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 21:45:02
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 21:45:05
NEXT IS COUNCILMEMBER KENG.


[Captioner] 21:45:06
>> Vice Mayor Keng:   THANK YOU, 


[Captioner] 21:45:07
MADAM MAYOR.


[Captioner] 21:45:10
I ACTUALLY -- I'M REALLY 


[Captioner] 21:45:12
APPRECIATIVE OF VICE MAYOR COX 


[Captioner] 21:45:14
BRINGING UP THIS REFERRAL.


[Captioner] 21:45:16
IN FACT I THINK PROBABLY WHEN I 


[Captioner] 21:45:20
WAS FIRST ELECTED, I ACTUALLY 


[Captioner] 21:45:22
HAD THIS IDEA AS WELL.


[Captioner] 21:45:23
I WAS THINKING, YOU KNOW, LIKE 


[Captioner] 21:45:26
WE HAVE THE INDIAN PARADE HAS 


[Captioner] 21:45:27
BEEN HAPPENING FOR A LONG TIME 


[Captioner] 21:45:30
AND THEN, YOU KNOW, DIFFERENT 


[Captioner] 21:45:32
CULTURAL GROUPS ALL HAVE THEIR 


[Captioner] 21:45:33
DIFFERENT CELEBRATIONS ON THEIR 


[Captioner] 21:45:34
OWN.


[Captioner] 21:45:36
NOW RECENTLY WE HAVE OUR -- THE 


[Captioner] 21:45:40
CITY HOSTED OUR FIRST LUNAR NEW 


[Captioner] 21:45:41
YEAR CELEBRATION WHICH IS PAID 


[Captioner] 21:45:43
FOR BY SPONSORS, I BELIEVE WHEN 


[Captioner] 21:45:44
THE LAST REPORT.


[Captioner] 21:45:46
BUT WE DON'T HAVE ONE, YOU KNOW, 


[Captioner] 21:45:49
WHERE WE CAN KIND OF SHARE THE 


[Captioner] 21:45:52
CULTURES, LEARN FROM EACH OTHER.


[Captioner] 21:45:54
EVERYONE COME AND LEARN ABOUT 


[Captioner] 21:45:55
DIFFERENT CULTURES.


[Captioner] 21:45:57
BECAUSE LIKE THE INDIAN PARADE, 


[Captioner] 21:45:58
LIKE TO ENTER THE EXHIBIT AREA I 


[Captioner] 21:46:01
THINK YOU HAVE TO PAY $5.


[Captioner] 21:46:05
AND THEN -- BUT, YOU KNOW, I 


[Captioner] 21:46:06
TAKE THE POINT VERY WELL THAT, 


[Captioner] 21:46:08
YOU KNOW, SOME SMALLER GROUPS OR 


[Captioner] 21:46:10
GROUPS WITHOUT THE RESOURCES, 


[Captioner] 21:46:13
THEY ARE NOT ABLE TO HOST THEIR 


[Captioner] 21:46:14
OWN FESTIVAL OR THEIR OWN 


[Captioner] 21:46:15
EVENTS.


[Captioner] 21:46:16
AND EVEN WITH THE PROGRAM THAT, 


[Captioner] 21:46:21
YOU KNOW, WE KIND OF STARTED 


[Captioner] 21:46:24
COUPLE YEARS AGO TO FUND TO KIND 


[Captioner] 21:46:27
OF HELP SUBSIDIZE SOME OF THE 


[Captioner] 21:46:29
NONPROFIT EVENTS, LIKE THEY HAVE 


[Captioner] 21:46:32
TO OWN -- THEY HAVE TO LIKE 


[Captioner] 21:46:34
FIRST SET UP A NONPROFIT IN 


[Captioner] 21:46:37
ORDER TO APPLY FOR THESE, THE 


[Captioner] 21:46:39
CITY GRANTS I BELIEVE.


[Captioner] 21:46:41
BUT IT'S STILL DIFFERENT, 


[Captioner] 21:46:42
THEY'RE STILL DOING THEY'RE OWN 


[Captioner] 21:46:43
THINGS.


[Captioner] 21:46:45
SO I WOULD BE HAPPY TO, YOU 


[Captioner] 21:46:48
KNOW, SEE STAFF KIND OF EXPLORE 


[Captioner] 21:46:50
THE IDEA AND I THINK THE TIME 


[Captioner] 21:46:53
LINE IS TO HAVE IT SOMETIME NEXT 


[Captioner] 21:46:54
YEAR.


[Captioner] 21:46:56
AND I THINK, YOU KNOW, THE ARTS 


[Captioner] 21:46:58
AND WINE FESTIVAL IS KIND OF 


[Captioner] 21:46:58
SPREAD OUT.


[Captioner] 21:47:01
IT'S NOT REALLY LIKE A CENTER 


[Captioner] 21:47:02
STAGE AND CELEBRATING THE 


[Captioner] 21:47:04
DIFFERENT CULTURES.


[Captioner] 21:47:06
AND YOU NEED TO PAY TO HAVE A 


[Captioner] 21:47:08
BOOTH THERE.


[Captioner] 21:47:13
AND I THINK TO VICE MAYOR COX 


[Captioner] 21:47:14
WAS PROPOSING, YOU KNOW, WHETHER 


[Captioner] 21:47:17
TO HAVE IT IN MAY, OR TO HAVE, 


[Captioner] 21:47:20
YOU KNOW, NOT TO REPLACE THE 


[Captioner] 21:47:22
WHOLE, YOU KNOW, SUMMER CONCERTS 


[Captioner] 21:47:24
WHICH PEOPLE ENJOY, AND I 


[Captioner] 21:47:27
ACTUALLY, WHEN WE WERE DOING THE 


[Captioner] 21:47:29
MASTER PLAN, THE PARK PLAN 


[Captioner] 21:47:32
UPDATE, I WAS HOPING THAT, YOU 


[Captioner] 21:47:36
KNOW, WE COULD ADOPT TO HAVE 


[Captioner] 21:47:39
SOME OF THE CONCERTS LIKE 


[Captioner] 21:47:42
FEATURING BANDS FROM DIFFERENT 


[Captioner] 21:47:44
CULTURES INSTEAD OF ALWAYS LIKE, 


[Captioner] 21:47:46
LIKE YOU KNOW THE SAME KIND OF 


[Captioner] 21:47:48
NOT NECESSARY THE SAME GENERAL 


[Captioner] 21:47:50
BUT THEY'RE ALL LIKE ENGLISH 


[Captioner] 21:47:51
MUSIC.


[Captioner] 21:47:52
BUT OUR COMMUNITY IS SO DIVERSE, 


[Captioner] 21:47:55
WE HAVE SO MANY LANGUAGES AND 


[Captioner] 21:47:56
CULTURES BEING CELEBRATED HERE, 


[Captioner] 21:48:00
I THINK TO REPLACE JUST ONE OF 


[Captioner] 21:48:02
THE SUMMER CONCERTS AND THE 


[Captioner] 21:48:03
SETUP IS ALREADY THERE AND WISE 


[Captioner] 21:48:05
CAN FIND -- WE HAVE A LOT OF 


[Captioner] 21:48:08
SPONSORS THAT ARE SPONSORING 


[Captioner] 21:48:12
THESE CONCERTS, LIKE META, 


[Captioner] 21:48:13
WASHINGTON HOSPITAL, FREMONT 


[Captioner] 21:48:15
BANK, RIGHT, I WOULD THINK THAT 


[Captioner] 21:48:19
WE COULD EXPLORE AND JUST TO 


[Captioner] 21:48:23
HAVE STAFF KIND OF EXPLORE WHAT 


[Captioner] 21:48:27
THE COST, IT DOESN'T HAVE TO 


[Captioner] 21:48:28
COST A LOT OF MONEY AND WE 


[Captioner] 21:48:29
ALREADY HAVE THE SETUP.


[Captioner] 21:48:31
SO IT COULD BE VERY DOABLE.


[Captioner] 21:48:35
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 21:48:36
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 21:48:41
NEXT IS COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN.


[Captioner] 21:48:41
>> Councilmember Salwan:   THANK 


[Captioner] 21:48:43
YOU, MADAM MAYOR AND THANK YOU 


[Captioner] 21:48:45
VICE MAYOR FOR BRINGING THIS 


[Captioner] 21:48:45
REFERRAL.


[Captioner] 21:48:47
FREMONT'S STRENGTH IS OUR 


[Captioner] 21:48:48
DIVERSITY.


[Captioner] 21:48:49
AND IT'S GOOD TO GET THE 


[Captioner] 21:48:51
COMMUNITY TOGETHER FOR CULTURE 


[Captioner] 21:48:52
EXCHANGE.


[Captioner] 21:48:55
AND YOU KNOW, CONNECT THE NEWER 


[Captioner] 21:48:58
IMMIGRANTS WITH THE OLDER 


[Captioner] 21:49:00
IMMIGRANTS AND KIND OF CREATE A 


[Captioner] 21:49:02
RICH COMMUNITY WHICH WE CAN 


[Captioner] 21:49:03
BENEFIT FROM EACH OTHER'S 


[Captioner] 21:49:05
EXPERIENCES SO I THINK 


[Captioner] 21:49:06
DEFINITELY WE NEED TO ENCOURAGE 


[Captioner] 21:49:07
MORE OF THAT IN MANY DIFFERENT 


[Captioner] 21:49:08
WAYS HOWEVER WE CAN.


[Captioner] 21:49:11
THE ONLY CONCERN I HAVE IS ABOUT 


[Captioner] 21:49:12
FUNDING.


[Captioner] 21:49:14
AND STAFF RESOURCES, I ALWAYS 


[Captioner] 21:49:16
WORRY ABOUT YOU KNOW WE HAVE 


[Captioner] 21:49:18
SOME VERY EXPENSIVE STAFF.


[Captioner] 21:49:19
ESPECIALLY AT OUR ADMINISTRATIVE 


[Captioner] 21:49:20
LEVEL.


[Captioner] 21:49:22
WITH PENSIONS, HEALTH CARE 


[Captioner] 21:49:24
BENEFITS, WHICH THEY RIGHTFULLY 


[Captioner] 21:49:25
DESERVE.


[Captioner] 21:49:27
I JUST DEFINITELY DON'T WANT 


[Captioner] 21:49:29
THEM IN THE BUSINESS OF RUNNING 


[Captioner] 21:49:31
EVENTS OR, YOU KNOW, 


[Captioner] 21:49:32
COORDINATING DIFFERENT DANCE 


[Captioner] 21:49:33
PROGRAMS.


[Captioner] 21:49:35
WHICH ARE GREAT, BUT I THINK 


[Captioner] 21:49:36
THOSE KIND OF THINGS SHOULD 


[Captioner] 21:49:38
PRIMARILY BE DRIVEN BY THE 


[Captioner] 21:49:40
COMMUNITY, SHOULD BE GRASS 


[Captioner] 21:49:43
ROOTS, AND SO I SUPPORT THE 


[Captioner] 21:49:45
CONCEPT OF HAVING SUCH A 


[Captioner] 21:49:48
FESTIVAL OF GETTING ALL THE 


[Captioner] 21:49:49
COMMUNITY MEMBERS TOGETHER FROM 


[Captioner] 21:49:52
ALL PARTS OF FREMONT, BOTH 


[Captioner] 21:49:55
ETHNICALLY, DIVERSITY, AND 


[Captioner] 21:49:56
GEOGRAPHICALLY.


[Captioner] 21:50:01
SO THE VENUE OR RATHER THE WAY 


[Captioner] 21:50:03
TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN, I THINK 


[Captioner] 21:50:06
WE'LL HAVE TO LOOK AT, SO ONE 


[Captioner] 21:50:08
WOULD BE CITY OF UNION CITY HAS 


[Captioner] 21:50:10
A SISTER CITY COMMISSION, SO 


[Captioner] 21:50:12
THAT'S ONE WAY THEY COULD DO IT.


[Captioner] 21:50:15
WHERE IT'S A NONPROFIT THAT'S 


[Captioner] 21:50:17
OUTSIDE GOVERNMENT FUNDING, 


[Captioner] 21:50:19
DIFFERENT GROUPS COME TOGETHER 


[Captioner] 21:50:21
AND THEY SUPPORT THE EVENT.


[Captioner] 21:50:24
AND HOPEFULLY IT'S PAID FOR BY 


[Captioner] 21:50:25
THE COMMUNITY, NOT BY THE CITY.


[Captioner] 21:50:29
AND THE CITY COULD JUST BE, YOU 


[Captioner] 21:50:31
KNOW, CO-SPONSOR OR ONE OF THE 


[Captioner] 21:50:33
MANY ORGANIZATIONS THAT MAKE IT 


[Captioner] 21:50:34
HAPPEN.


[Captioner] 21:50:36
ALSO, SOMETIMES WHEN THESE 


[Captioner] 21:50:37
EVENTS HAPPEN FROM TOP DOWN, 


[Captioner] 21:50:39
THEY LOSE MOMENTUM OVER THE 


[Captioner] 21:50:39
YEARS.


[Captioner] 21:50:42
THEY GET KIND OF TIRING AND 


[Captioner] 21:50:44
EXHAUSTING WHEN THE CITY'S DOING 


[Captioner] 21:50:46
EVERYTHING AND THERE'S NOT THAT 


[Captioner] 21:50:47
BUY-IN, THAT OWNERSHIP OF THE 


[Captioner] 21:50:48
EVENT.


[Captioner] 21:50:50
SO I THINK WE WANT TO HAVE AN 


[Captioner] 21:50:51
EVENT THAT'S DRIVEN BY THE 


[Captioner] 21:50:52
PEOPLE, BY THE COMMUNITY 


[Captioner] 21:50:54
MEMBERS, BY THE VARIOUS 


[Captioner] 21:50:56
NONPROFITS, THE VARIOUS ETHNIC 


[Captioner] 21:50:57
GROUPS AND WHOEVER HAS THAT FIRE 


[Captioner] 21:50:58
IN THE BELLY.


[Captioner] 21:51:01
SO I THINK IF, WHEN STAFF BRINGS 


[Captioner] 21:51:03
THIS BACK, IN WE CAN SEE HOW WE 


[Captioner] 21:51:05
CAN FACILITATE SUCH AN EVENT BUT 


[Captioner] 21:51:07
NOT BE THE OWNER OF SUCH AN 


[Captioner] 21:51:09
EVENT, WHERE WE'RE NOT 


[Captioner] 21:51:10
COORDINATING THE EVENT, WE'RE 


[Captioner] 21:51:13
NOT SPENDING A LOT OF MONEY, NOT 


[Captioner] 21:51:15
USING A LOT OF STAFF TIME AND 


[Captioner] 21:51:16
FACILITATE A WAY FOR THE 


[Captioner] 21:51:19
COMMUNITY TO HAVE THIS CULTURE 


[Captioner] 21:51:19
EXCHANGE.


[Captioner] 21:51:21
SO WHICH WE CAN ALL BENEFIT 


[Captioner] 21:51:22
THERE.


[Captioner] 21:51:24
SO I WOULD BE OPEN TO SUPPORTING 


[Captioner] 21:51:26
THIS JUST AS LONG AS WE LOOK AT 


[Captioner] 21:51:28
THE FUNDING AND THE RESOURCES 


[Captioner] 21:51:30
AND PERHAPS LOOK AT LIKE THE 


[Captioner] 21:51:35
SISTER CITY MODEL THAT IS THERE.


[Captioner] 21:51:38
AS FAR AS THE SISTER CITY MODEL, 


[Captioner] 21:51:41
I HAVEN'T LOOKED AT IT MUCH, THE 


[Captioner] 21:51:44
CITY DOESN'T HAVE TO DO MUCH, 


[Captioner] 21:51:45
OTHER THAN THEY WILL SIGN THE 


[Captioner] 21:51:48
APPLICATION TO MAKE THE SISTER 


[Captioner] 21:51:50
CITY APPLICATION POSSIBLE.


[Captioner] 21:51:51
ONCE DO YOU THAT, YOU CAN BRING 


[Captioner] 21:51:53
ALL THE DIFFERENT DIVERSE 


[Captioner] 21:51:55
ORGANIZATIONS AND THEY CAN RUN 


[Captioner] 21:51:56
IT FROM THERE.


[Captioner] 21:51:57
AND CITY STAFF WOULD JUST SHOW 


[Captioner] 21:51:58
UP AT THE EVENT.


[Captioner] 21:52:01
AND SO IT WOULD BE -- YES.


[Captioner] 21:52:06
SO, AND UNION CITY DOES IT AT 


[Captioner] 21:52:08
THEIR MARK GREEN SPORTS CENTER 


[Captioner] 21:52:10
SO WE HAVE OUR DOWNTOWN EVENT 


[Captioner] 21:52:11
CENTER WHICH IS RIGHT IN THE 


[Captioner] 21:52:12
HEART OF FREMONT.


[Captioner] 21:52:15
SO ANYWAYS I WOULD BE HAPPY TO 


[Captioner] 21:52:16
SUPPORT THAT AS LONG AS YOU GUYS 


[Captioner] 21:52:18
MAKE A PROMISE THAT WE DON'T 


[Captioner] 21:52:19
HAVE ANY NOR EVENTS OR 


[Captioner] 21:52:21
PROCLAMATIONS OR FLAG RAISINGS 


[Captioner] 21:52:23
OR ANY MORE REFERRALS FOR THE 


[Captioner] 21:52:23
REST OF THE YEAR.


[Captioner] 21:52:29
>> YOU'RE STEALING MY THURNLD, 


[Captioner] 21:52:30
 


[Captioner] 21:52:30
COUNCILMEMBER.


[Captioner] 21:52:35
 THUNDER, 


[Captioner] 21:52:36
COUNCILMEMBER.


[Captioner] 21:52:37
>> Mayor Mei:   COUNCILMEMBER 


[Captioner] 21:52:39
CAMPBELL.


[Captioner] 21:52:40
>> Councilmember Campbell:   OH 


[Captioner] 21:52:41
HI, THANK YOU COUNCILMEMBER FOR 


[Captioner] 21:52:42
BRINGING THIS REFERRAL.


[Captioner] 21:52:45
I DO SORT OF ECHO THE COMMENTS 


[Captioner] 21:52:47
I'VE HEARD IN TERMS OF REALLY 


[Captioner] 21:52:51
HAVING A CULTURAL EXCHANGE.


[Captioner] 21:52:53
I REMEMBER, WHEN WE HAD THIS ONE 


[Captioner] 21:52:55
WORLD EVENT, I WAS DISAPPOINTED 


[Captioner] 21:52:57
BECAUSE I DIDN'T SEE ANY 


[Captioner] 21:52:58
ENTERTAINMENT THAT LOOKED LIKE 


[Captioner] 21:52:59
ME THERE.


[Captioner] 21:53:02
THERE HAD BEEN NO REAL REACH OUT 


[Captioner] 21:53:02
TO THE AFRICAN AMERICAN 


[Captioner] 21:53:04
COMMUNITY SO I FELT DISAPPOINTED 


[Captioner] 21:53:05
THAT OTHER CULTURES WERE 


[Captioner] 21:53:08
REPRESENTED IN THAT ONE WORLD 


[Captioner] 21:53:09

EVENT AND I SHARED IT WITH MAYOR 


[Captioner] 21:53:12
MEI.


[Captioner] 21:53:14
>> Mayor Mei:   I KNOW.


[Captioner] 21:53:14
>> Councilmember Campbell:   


[Captioner] 21:53:16
IT'S NOT SOMETHING SHE HASN'T 


[Captioner] 21:53:17
HEARD BEFORE.


[Captioner] 21:53:18
IN ORDER FOR THAT TO HAPPEN WE 


[Captioner] 21:53:20
REALLY HAVE TO BE INCLUSIVE.


[Captioner] 21:53:21
AND IN ORDER TO HAVE A FESTIVAL, 


[Captioner] 21:53:26
WE HAVE TO INCLUDE ALL OF THE 


[Captioner] 21:53:28
ETHNICITIES WITHIN OUR 


[Captioner] 21:53:28
COMMUNITY.


[Captioner] 21:53:30
AND SOMEHOW IN THAT CASE WE 


[Captioner] 21:53:32
MISSED THE MARK.


[Captioner] 21:53:34
WE -- I HAVE A QUESTION, THOUGH, 


[Captioner] 21:53:36
DON'T WE HAVE A PERSON WHO WORKS 


[Captioner] 21:53:38
IN HUMAN SERVICES WHO'S A FUND 


[Captioner] 21:53:39
RAISER PERSON?


[Captioner] 21:53:45
WE DID?


[Captioner] 21:53:45
>> YES AND NO.


[Captioner] 21:53:47
I MEAN NOT FOR THESE TYPES OF 


[Captioner] 21:53:51
EVENTS, FCC, BUT YES, WE DO HAVE 


[Captioner] 21:53:54
A FUND RAISER, A GRANT WRITER IN 


[Captioner] 21:53:55
HUMAN SERVICES.


[Captioner] 21:53:56
>> Councilmember Campbell:   


[Captioner] 21:53:56
OKAY.


[Captioner] 21:53:59
THE OTHER WAY, ANOTHER MODEL 


[Captioner] 21:54:00
THAT HAS WORKED FOR ME WHEN I 


[Captioner] 21:54:03
PUT TOGETHER BIG EVENTS, IS TO 


[Captioner] 21:54:07
HAVE A VOLUNTEER TEAM WHO WOULD 


[Captioner] 21:54:10
ACTUALLY HELP ME, NOT 


[Captioner] 21:54:13
NECESSARILY STAFF, I BROUGHT IN 


[Captioner] 21:54:14
COMMUNITY MEMBERS FROM DIFFERENT 


[Captioner] 21:54:16
BUSINESSES, FAITH BASED 


[Captioner] 21:54:19
ORGANIZATIONS, ALL OF THEM CAME, 


[Captioner] 21:54:20
WE ALL CAME TOGETHER, AND WE 


[Captioner] 21:54:24
CREATED THE EVENT TOGETHER.


[Captioner] 21:54:25
ALTHOUGH I WAS, YOU KNOW, THE 


[Captioner] 21:54:28
PAID STAFF WHO ACTUALLY RAN THE 


[Captioner] 21:54:29
EVENTS.


[Captioner] 21:54:34
THEY HELPED ME WITH DONATIONS 


[Captioner] 21:54:35
AND, YOU KNOW, ALL OF THE THINGS 


[Captioner] 21:54:37
THAT GO INTO PUTTING ON AN 


[Captioner] 21:54:38
EVENT.


[Captioner] 21:54:42
THEY DID ASKS, THEY HAD THEIR 


[Captioner] 21:54:44
OWN HUB OF COMMUNITY PARTNERS 


[Captioner] 21:54:46
THAT THEY WORK WITH, TO BRING 


[Captioner] 21:54:47
EVERYBODY TOGETHER.


[Captioner] 21:54:51
SO THAT WAS A MODEL THAT COULD 


[Captioner] 21:54:52
POSSIBLY WORK AS WELL.


[Captioner] 21:54:56
BECAUSE I AM LIKE COUNCILMEMBER 


[Captioner] 21:54:58
SALWAN SAID, CONCERNED ABOUT 


[Captioner] 21:55:00
STAFF TIME TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS 


[Captioner] 21:55:02
YEAR OVER YEAR OVER YEAR.


[Captioner] 21:55:04
BECAUSE IT CAN FIZZLE OUT AFTER 


[Captioner] 21:55:06
A WHILE, AS YOU GET TURNOVER AND 


[Captioner] 21:55:07
THAT KIND OF STUFF.


[Captioner] 21:55:10
BUT YOU COULD PUT TOGETHER AN 


[Captioner] 21:55:11
ALL VOLUNTEER COMMITTEE WHO 


[Captioner] 21:55:13
WOULD BE WILLING TO DO SOMETHING 


[Captioner] 21:55:16
LIKE THIS AS WELL.


[Captioner] 21:55:17
BUT IN REALITY, I'M VERY 


[Captioner] 21:55:20
SUPPORTIVE OF A CULTURAL 


[Captioner] 21:55:22
EXCHANGE AND, YOU KNOW, BECAUSE 


[Captioner] 21:55:24
WE HAVE SO MANY DIFFERENT 


[Captioner] 21:55:25
CULTURES, MAYBE IT WILL BE TWO 


[Captioner] 21:55:27
HALF-DAYS, SORT OF LIKE WHAT 


[Captioner] 21:55:30
THEY DO FOR THE JAZZ FESTIVAL.


[Captioner] 21:55:32
DOWN IN SAN JOSE.


[Captioner] 21:55:33
THEY HAVE IT OVER, YOU KNOW A 


[Captioner] 21:55:35
COUPLE OF DAYS SO THAT EVERYBODY 


[Captioner] 21:55:36
CAN INCLUDED.


[Captioner] 21:55:39
 IN THE PROGRAMS 


[Captioner] 21:55:40
GIVEN THE SIZE OF THE CITY.


[Captioner] 21:55:42
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 21:55:44
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 21:55:47
SO I WANT TO SHARE MY COMMENTS.


[Captioner] 21:55:48
A COUPLE OF THINGS.


[Captioner] 21:55:50
YES, I KNOW THAT WHEN WE DID THE 


[Captioner] 21:55:52
ONE WORLD, ONE COMMUNITY, 


[Captioner] 21:55:53
UNFORTUNATELY BECAUSE IT WAS PUT 


[Captioner] 21:55:55
TOGETHER DUE TO THERE WAS SOME 


[Captioner] 21:55:56
STRIFE IN SCHOOLS AT THAT TIME, 


[Captioner] 21:55:58
SO I HAD PUT IT TOGETHER AND 


[Captioner] 21:56:01
FUNDED IT BECAUSE I WANTED TO 


[Captioner] 21:56:02
INCLUDE AS MANY ORGANIZATIONS.


[Captioner] 21:56:05
AND WE DID HAVE DIFFERENT CHOIR 


[Captioner] 21:56:08
GROUPS THAT WERE TRYING TO BE 


[Captioner] 21:56:09
REFLECTIVE OF THE SONGS, WE 


[Captioner] 21:56:11
DIDN'T HAVE A SPECIFIC GROUP, 


[Captioner] 21:56:13
THERE WASN'T ONE THAT WAS A 


[Captioner] 21:56:14
PERFORMING ARTS PROGRAM, BECAUSE 


[Captioner] 21:56:16
I KNOW YOU AND I TALKED AT THAT 


[Captioner] 21:56:19
TIME, BECAUSE I WAS CONCERNED 


[Captioner] 21:56:20
ABOUT THAT.


[Captioner] 21:56:22
WHEN IT COMES IN MAY, WE 


[Captioner] 21:56:24
NORMALLY HAVE, I DON'T KNOW IF 


[Captioner] 21:56:26
IT'S PLANNED FOR THIS YEAR, WE 


[Captioner] 21:56:28
NORMALLY DO HAVE A HEALTH FAIR, 


[Captioner] 21:56:29
PLANNED IN THE PARK, FOR 


[Captioner] 21:56:31
EVERYONE, FOR SENIOR HEALTH FAIR 


[Captioner] 21:56:33
BUT IT IS SOMETHING WE NORMALLY 


[Captioner] 21:56:35
HOLD AS A CITY WITH OUR HUMAN 


[Captioner] 21:56:38
SERVICES DEPARTMENT, WHEN IT 


[Captioner] 21:56:40
COMES TO INTERFAITH BECAUSE IT'S 


[Captioner] 21:56:42
MORE OF A RELIGIOUS DISCUSSION, 


[Captioner] 21:56:44
WE USUALLY HAVE AN INTERFAITH 


[Captioner] 21:56:47
AWARENESS DAY AND ALSO 


[Captioner] 21:56:49
THANKSGIVING, A WONDERFUL ONE 


[Captioner] 21:56:50
THAT SHARES BOTH CULTURE AND 


[Captioner] 21:56:52
MUSIC AND DANCE AND THAT'S DONE 


[Captioner] 21:56:54
THROUGH THE INTERFAITH COUNCIL 


[Captioner] 21:56:57
EVERY YEAR THROUGH THANKSGIVING, 


[Captioner] 21:56:59
A GREAT WAY TO SHARE 


[Captioner] 21:57:01
APPRECIATION AND THANKS TO 


[Captioner] 21:57:01
EVERYONE.


[Captioner] 21:57:03
AS TO THE COMMUNITY FESTIVALS, 


[Captioner] 21:57:05
I'M INTERESTED IN THAT, 


[Captioner] 21:57:06
COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL AND I 


[Captioner] 21:57:09
HAVE BEEN TO AS WELL AS 


[Captioner] 21:57:10
COUNCILMEMBER SHAO MANY OF THE 


[Captioner] 21:57:12
SCHOOLS FOR THE MULTICULTURAL 


[Captioner] 21:57:16
FESTIVALS, THE CHALLENGE IS TO 


[Captioner] 21:57:19
LIMIT WHICH GROUP PERFORMANCE, 


[Captioner] 21:57:21
EVEN IF IT'S A TWO DAY FESTIVAL 


[Captioner] 21:57:23
IT GETS VERY INTENSE AS TO WHO 


[Captioner] 21:57:26
CAN AND CAN'T PERFORM AND HOW WE 


[Captioner] 21:57:26
BALANCE IT.


[Captioner] 21:57:29
I JUST WANT TO RHYME EVERYONE 


[Captioner] 21:57:31
WHEN WE HAD OUR RETREAT WE 


[Captioner] 21:57:32
AGREED TO THREE PRIORITIES.


[Captioner] 21:57:33
IT IS NOT THAT I'M NOT 


[Captioner] 21:57:35
SUPPORTIVE OF THIS BUT OUR FIRST 


[Captioner] 21:57:37
FOCUS WAS TO CONTINUE TO ADDRESS 


[Captioner] 21:57:40
HOMELESSNESS, TO ENHANCE PUBLIC 


[Captioner] 21:57:43
SAFETY AND TO INCREASE VITALITY 


[Captioner] 21:57:44
OF COMMERCIAL CORRIDORS.


[Captioner] 21:57:46
ONE THING WE CAN DO PERHAPS WITH 


[Captioner] 21:57:48
SOME OF THE BUSINESS CHAMBERS WE 


[Captioner] 21:57:50
HAVE TALKED ABOUT SOME OF THE 


[Captioner] 21:57:52
CONCERTS THEY'VE DONE, WHICH IS 


[Captioner] 21:57:55
OUR CONCERT SERIES WHICH IS SIX 


[Captioner] 21:57:56
CONCERT SERIES AND I KNOW THAT 


[Captioner] 21:57:58
THE RECREATION DEPARTMENT 


[Captioner] 21:57:59
USUALLY HELPS US SELECT THE 


[Captioner] 21:58:00
BANDS.


[Captioner] 21:58:01
BUT THAT IS ONE OF THE THINGS 


[Captioner] 21:58:03
THAT WOULD BE TOUCHY, IF WE 


[Captioner] 21:58:06
PICKED OUT -- SWAPPED OUT ONE OF 


[Captioner] 21:58:08
THEM AND WE DIDN'T INCLUDE OTHER 


[Captioner] 21:58:09
ETHNIC GROUPS I IMAGINE WE COULD 


[Captioner] 21:58:11
HAVE SOME FEEDBACK.


[Captioner] 21:58:14
BUT IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE, 


[Captioner] 21:58:14
WE'VE HAD ALSO IN THE PAST I 


[Captioner] 21:58:17
THINK AT THE YOUTH LEVEL WE'VE 


[Captioner] 21:58:19
HAD VOICE OF FREMONT CONTEST AND 


[Captioner] 21:58:21
WE HAD DIFFERENT PEOPLE SING TO 


[Captioner] 21:58:24
DO THE COMPETITION, I THINK 


[Captioner] 21:58:25
THAT'S WITH OUR TEENS.


[Captioner] 21:58:27
I ALSO THINK THAT, AGAIN I WANT 


[Captioner] 21:58:29
TO FOCUS ON MAKING SURE THAT WE 


[Captioner] 21:58:30
HAVE THE BUDGETS AND TIME.


[Captioner] 21:58:32
I'M NOT AGAINST THAT IDEA BUT 


[Captioner] 21:58:34
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO THE 


[Captioner] 21:58:35
DIFFERENT HISTORIC BUSINESS 


[Captioner] 21:58:37
DISTRICTS, I KNOW NILES DOES 


[Captioner] 21:58:38
CONCERTS IN THE PARK AND OTHER 


[Captioner] 21:58:39
GROUPS.


[Captioner] 21:58:40
PERHAPS IT IS SOME OF THE THINGS 


[Captioner] 21:58:42
WE CAN TALK TO THE BUSINESS 


[Captioner] 21:58:44
DISTRICT ABOUT, TO HIGHLIGHT TO 


[Captioner] 21:58:47
MAKE SURE DIFFERENT GROUPS ARE 


[Captioner] 21:58:49
SPOTLIGHTED, SO IT DOESN'T HAVE 


[Captioner] 21:58:50
TO BE RESTRICTED.


[Captioner] 21:58:51
I THINK IT WOULD BE A LITTLE 


[Captioner] 21:58:51
TOUGH.


[Captioner] 21:58:54
I KNOW IF IT WAS A TWO DAY 


[Captioner] 21:58:55
FESTIVAL, TO BE ABLE TO CAP AND 


[Captioner] 21:58:59
SAY WHO CAN AND CAN'T PERFORM.


[Captioner] 21:59:01
BECAUSE WE GENERALLY HAVE HAD 


[Captioner] 21:59:01
FEES.


[Captioner] 21:59:04
AND I KNOW THAT IS A RESTRICTIVE 


[Captioner] 21:59:06
PART IN TERMS OF HAVING PEOPLE 


[Captioner] 21:59:06
PARTICIPATE.


[Captioner] 21:59:07
BUT AT THE SAME TIME I'M NOT 


[Captioner] 21:59:09
SURE THE CITY CAN FUND AND I 


[Captioner] 21:59:11
DON'T KNOW HOW WE WOULD DECIDE 


[Captioner] 21:59:14
WHICH GROUP, ASIDE FROM WHEN WE 


[Captioner] 21:59:15
DO SOME OF OUR FUNDING THROUGH 


[Captioner] 21:59:18
THE NONPROFITS, WHICH GROUP WE 


[Captioner] 21:59:19
WOULD FUND WHICH BAND WE 


[Captioner] 21:59:21
WOULDN'T FUND.


[Captioner] 21:59:22
EARLIER TONIGHT WE TALK ABOUT 


[Captioner] 21:59:25
THE ARTS AND FREMONT CREATES AND 


[Captioner] 21:59:26
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME WE'RE 


[Captioner] 21:59:27
DOING IT.


[Captioner] 21:59:28
I'M REALLY EXCITED.


[Captioner] 21:59:29
IT'S A GREAT WAY FOR US TO 


[Captioner] 21:59:32
SHOWCASE MUSIC AND ARTWORK AND 


[Captioner] 21:59:33
 


[Captioner] 21:59:35
CULTURAL HERITAGE AND THAT'S 


[Captioner] 21:59:38
EXACTLY WHAT THE MONTH OF APRIL 


[Captioner] 21:59:41
IS AT, FOR THE FIRST TIME WE AS 


[Captioner] 21:59:43
THE CITY OF FREMONT ARE HOLDING 


[Captioner] 21:59:44
FREMONT CREATES.


[Captioner] 21:59:45
PERHAPS THAT IS SOMETHING NEXT 


[Captioner] 21:59:47
YEAR IF WE CAN TALK TO THE 


[Captioner] 21:59:50
DIFFERENT ART ASSOCIATIONS AND 


[Captioner] 21:59:51
ETHNIC GROUPS TO BE ABILITY TO 


[Captioner] 21:59:53
SHARE THAT I THINK THAT MIGHT BE 


[Captioner] 21:59:54
SOMETHING THAT COULD BE 


[Captioner] 21:59:55
INTEGRATED INTO THAT.


[Captioner] 21:59:57
BUT THIS IS OUR FIRST TIME WE'RE 


[Captioner] 21:59:59
DOING IT IN THIS MONTH OF APRIL 


[Captioner] 22:00:01
AND BEING THAT WE JUST TALKED 


[Captioner] 22:00:02
ABOUT TONIGHT OUR HERITAGE 


[Captioner] 22:00:03
MONTH.


[Captioner] 22:00:05
SO I'M SUPPORTIVE OF THE CONCEPT 


[Captioner] 22:00:06
BUT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE 


[Captioner] 22:00:08
BUDGET, I'M CONCERNED ABOUT OUR 


[Captioner] 22:00:09
FOCUS AND WE JUST AGREED WHEN WE 


[Captioner] 22:00:11
TALKED ABOUT IT, WE HAD LITTLE 


[Captioner] 22:00:13
DOTS AND WE EACH VOTED OUR THREE 


[Captioner] 22:00:16
DOTS AND WE SAID THESE ARE OUR 


[Captioner] 22:00:17
PRIORITIES AND ANYTHING THAT 


[Captioner] 22:00:19
COMES ONTO THERE, PER THE CITY 


[Captioner] 22:00:21
 CITY 


[Captioner] 22:00:22
MANAGER'S INSTRUCTION, SOMETHING 


[Captioner] 22:00:25
THAT COMES ON, SOMETHING MIGHT 


[Captioner] 22:00:26
HAVE TO COME OFF.


[Captioner] 22:00:29
WE HAVE TO BE COGNIZANT OF THAT 


[Captioner] 22:00:30
BECAUSE THERE IS SO MUCH WE HAVE 


[Captioner] 22:00:31
TO COVER.


[Captioner] 22:00:34
EVEN TONIGHT, THINGS WE ARE 


[Captioner] 22:00:36
DEALING WITH, HOPEFULLY BY THE 


[Captioner] 22:00:38
TIME WE LEAVE IT WON'T BE AS 


[Captioner] 22:00:41
MUCH OF AN ISSUE, BUT THE 


[Captioner] 22:00:42
STORMS.


[Captioner] 22:00:44
TO FOCUS ON THE LAND USE AND 


[Captioner] 22:00:46
ROADS AND INFRASTRUCTURE AND 


[Captioner] 22:00:47
PUBLIC SAFETY WHICH ARE KEY.


[Captioner] 22:00:50
AND SO I AM SUPPORTIVE OF IT BUT 


[Captioner] 22:00:51
I'M CONCERNED ABOUT TAKING 


[Captioner] 22:00:52
ANYTHING OFF OF THE TABLE.


[Captioner] 22:00:55
SO WITH THAT, I SEE 


[Captioner] 22:00:59
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN AND 


[Captioner] 22:01:00
COUNCILMEMBER COX, COUNCILMEMBER 


[Captioner] 22:01:01
COX DID YOU WANT TO ADD 


[Captioner] 22:01:02
SOMETHING TO THIS?


[Captioner] 22:01:03
>> Councilmember Cox:   YES, I 


[Captioner] 22:01:04
DID WANT TO SAY THAT WE -- IT 


[Captioner] 22:01:07
WAS A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO THAT 


[Captioner] 22:01:09
WE ABOLISHED AND CLOSED OUT THE 


[Captioner] 22:01:11
SISTER COMMISSION IS THAT NOT 


[Captioner] 22:01:11
CORRECT?


[Captioner] 22:01:13
IT DOES NOT EXIST WITH THE CITY 


[Captioner] 22:01:17
OF FREMONT.


[Captioner] 22:01:18
>> Karena Shackelford:   I THINK 


[Captioner] 22:01:20
IT'S BEEN MORE THAN A COUPLE OF 


[Captioner] 22:01:24
YEARS BUT IT NO LONGER EXISTS.


[Captioner] 22:01:26
>> Mayor Mei:   WE HAD SIX 


[Captioner] 22:01:29
SISTER CITIES WHEN I STARTED.


[Captioner] 22:01:31
>> Councilmember Cox:   I GOT A 


[Captioner] 22:01:32
CALL FROM THE HUMAN RELATIONS 


[Captioner] 22:01:34
COMMISSIONER AND THEY HAD CALLED 


[Captioner] 22:01:36
ME TO SAY THAT THEY WERE IN 


[Captioner] 22:01:37
SUPPORT OF THIS IDEA BECAUSE 


[Captioner] 22:01:39
THEY WERE LOOKING AT SOME ARVES 


[Captioner] 22:01:42
OF HOW TO HAVE SOME 


[Captioner] 22:01:43
MULTICULTURAL CELEBRATIONS AND 


[Captioner] 22:01:45
THAT'S BEEN ON THEIR TOPIC OF 


[Captioner] 22:01:47
SOME OF THEIR DISCUSSION FOR 


[Captioner] 22:01:48
THEIR MEETINGS OVER THE LAST I 


[Captioner] 22:01:52
GUESS COUPLE OF MONTHS OR SO.


[Captioner] 22:01:53
>> Karena Shackelford:   SO ONE 


[Captioner] 22:01:54
OF THE THINGS I'D LIKE TO SHARE 


[Captioner] 22:01:56
WITH YOU ALL IS THAT SEVERAL 


[Captioner] 22:01:59
YEARS AGO, IT PREDATED ME AND 


[Captioner] 22:02:01
I'VE BEEN HERE WITH THE CITY FOR 


[Captioner] 22:02:04
MANY, MANY YEARS.


[Captioner] 22:02:09
BUT WE HAD A MULTICULTURAL TYPE 


[Captioner] 22:02:11
EVENT THAT CITY STAFF DID THE 


[Captioner] 22:02:12
HEAVY LIFT FOR.


[Captioner] 22:02:16
AND THAT EVENT FIZZLED OUT AND 


[Captioner] 22:02:19
MIGRATED TO WHAT WE CALL MAKE A 


[Captioner] 22:02:19
DIFFERENCE DAY.


[Captioner] 22:02:24
AND THE IDEA BETWEEN MAKE A 


[Captioner] 22:02:26
DIFFERENCE DAY, IT WAS LIKE A 


[Captioner] 22:02:28
NATIONAL VOLUNTEER TYPE EVENT.


[Captioner] 22:02:31
WHERE IT ATTRACTED PEOPLE FROM 


[Captioner] 22:02:32
DIFFERENT CULTURES, ETHNICITIES 


[Captioner] 22:02:36
AND ALL OF THAT TO CONTRIBUTE TO 


[Captioner] 22:02:37
A PROJECT.


[Captioner] 22:02:40
BECAUSE THE PREVIOUS EVENT WAS 


[Captioner] 22:02:44
COSTLY, FINANCIALLY, IN TERMS OF 


[Captioner] 22:02:47
STAFF TIME, AND RESOURCES AND 


[Captioner] 22:02:48
ALL OF THAT.


[Captioner] 22:02:50
BUT THIS ALLOWED FOR MORE 


[Captioner] 22:02:52
COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT FROM, YOU 


[Captioner] 22:02:54
KNOW, EVERYONE IN THE COMMUNITY.


[Captioner] 22:02:55
SO DIFFERENT CULTURES.


[Captioner] 22:02:57
AND ALL OF THAT.


[Captioner] 22:02:59
SO THERE WAS SOMETHING LIKE THIS 


[Captioner] 22:02:59
BEFORE.


[Captioner] 22:03:01
AND IT DID CHANGE.


[Captioner] 22:03:03
IT TURNED INTO MAKE A DIFFERENCE 


[Captioner] 22:03:03
DAY.


[Captioner] 22:03:07
I KNOW THAT THE PREVIOUS EVENT 


[Captioner] 22:03:09
THAT WAS SIMILAR TO THIS WAS 


[Captioner] 22:03:11
LAUNCHED BY THE HUMAN RELATIONS 


[Captioner] 22:03:14
COMMISSION, I BELIEVE, THE 


[Captioner] 22:03:17
MULTICULTURE EVENT.


[Captioner] 22:03:19
SO ANYWAY I JUST KIND OF SHARE 


[Captioner] 22:03:21
THAT AS A WAY OF BACKGROUND.


[Captioner] 22:03:23
THE OTHER THING I'D LIKE TO 


[Captioner] 22:03:25
SHARE WITH YOU ALL IS THAT, YOU 


[Captioner] 22:03:26
KNOW, REFERRALS ARE TYPICALLY A 


[Captioner] 22:03:28
TWO-STEP PROCESS SO A 


[Captioner] 22:03:29
COUNCILMEMBER MAKES A REFERRAL 


[Captioner] 22:03:33
AND THEN IN THE EVENT THAT YOU 


[Captioner] 22:03:36
ALL DISAGREE TO MOVE THE 


[Captioner] 22:03:37
REFERRAL ALONG AND ASK STAFF TO 


[Captioner] 22:03:39
DO THE RESEARCH ON IT OR 


[Captioner] 22:03:41
WHATEVER, WE DO AND WE COME BACK 


[Captioner] 22:03:43
WITH OUR RECOMMENDATIONS.


[Captioner] 22:03:45
THAT'S HOW THAT WORKS.


[Captioner] 22:03:47
SO -- AND THAT'S WHAT WE'LL DO 


[Captioner] 22:03:48
SHOULD THIS REFERRAL PASS.


[Captioner] 22:03:52
BUT I DO WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU 


[Captioner] 22:03:54
THAT BY WAY OF THE PARK MASTER 


[Captioner] 22:03:56
PLAN, AND SOME OF THE OTHER 


[Captioner] 22:03:59
THINGS THAT OTHER PLANS THAT WE 


[Captioner] 22:04:01
HAVE, THE CHARM OF THOSE IS THAT 


[Captioner] 22:04:03
SOME OF THESE IDEAS ARE ALREADY 


[Captioner] 22:04:06
MEMORIALIZED IN THOSE PLANS.


[Captioner] 22:04:08
THAT YOU ALL APPROVED.


[Captioner] 22:04:09
SO WE REALLY KIND OF HAVE OUR 


[Captioner] 22:04:11
MARCHING ORDERS ALREADY IN TERMS 


[Captioner] 22:04:14
OF TRYING TO MAKE SOME OF THESE 


[Captioner] 22:04:16
THINGS HAPPEN, SOME WAY SOMEHOW.


[Captioner] 22:04:24
SO IT MAY NOT COME ACROSS AS 


[Captioner] 22:04:26
PRESCRIPTIVE AS YOU KNOW MAYBE 


[Captioner] 22:04:28
WE'VE DISCUSSED HERE FLIT, BUT 


[Captioner] 22:04:30
PERHAPS YOU'LL SEE -- YOU MAY 


[Captioner] 22:04:33
SEE SOME ELEMENTS OF A 


[Captioner] 22:04:35
MULTICULTURAL EVENT OR A MORE 


[Captioner] 22:04:42
COMPREHENSIVE EVENT IN OUR MUSIC 


[Captioner] 22:04:44
IN THE PARK OR SOME OF THE OTHER 


[Captioner] 22:04:45
THINGS.


[Captioner] 22:04:46
>> Mayor Mei:   MUSIC IN THE 


[Captioner] 22:04:50
PARK AND SENIOR FESTIVAL.


[Captioner] 22:04:51
>> Karena Shackelford:   OR 


[Captioner] 22:04:51
OTHER THINGS.


[Captioner] 22:04:54
YOU ALL SET THE POLICY DIRECTION 


[Captioner] 22:04:56
AND IT'S UP TO US TO FIGURE OUT 


[Captioner] 22:04:58
HOUSE TO, YOU KNOW, MAKE THOSE 


[Captioner] 22:04:59
THINGS COME TO FRUITION.


[Captioner] 22:05:01
SO IT SOUNDS LIKE WHAT I'M 


[Captioner] 22:05:03
HEARING IS THAT YOU WANT 


[Captioner] 22:05:06
SOMETHING THAT IS KIND OF MORE 


[Captioner] 22:05:09
ENCOMPASSING LIKE IN ONE SETTING 


[Captioner] 22:05:13
OF, YOU KNOW, THE MANY CULTURES 


[Captioner] 22:05:15
THAT ARE REPRESENTATIVE OF 


[Captioner] 22:05:15
TREATMENT.


[Captioner] 22:05:16
SO I'M HEARING THAT.


[Captioner] 22:05:17
STAFF IS HEARING THAT.


[Captioner] 22:05:22
I DON'T THINK IT REQUIRES A 


[Captioner] 22:05:23
PRESCRIPTION TO MAKE THAT 


[Captioner] 22:05:23
HAPPEN.


[Captioner] 22:05:25
I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE 


[Captioner] 22:05:27
CAN WORK ON OVER TIME.


[Captioner] 22:05:29
MAYOR MEI RAISED A GOOD POINT 


[Captioner] 22:05:31
ABOUT THE RETREAT AND I KNOW I'M 


[Captioner] 22:05:32
GOING TO SOUND LIKE A BROKEN 


[Captioner] 22:05:33
RECORD AS WELL.


[Captioner] 22:05:34
CORE SERVICES.


[Captioner] 22:05:37
WE GOT TO PICK UP THESE DOWNED 


[Captioner] 22:05:39
TREES, WE'VE GOT TO TAKE CARE OF 


[Captioner] 22:05:40
OUR PARKS.


[Captioner] 22:05:42
WE'VE GOT TO PAVE OUR ROADS OR 


[Captioner] 22:05:43
WHATEVER.


[Captioner] 22:05:45
SO THERE'S A LOT WE NEED TO DO.


[Captioner] 22:05:46
BUT AGAIN I'M HEARING WHAT 


[Captioner] 22:05:48
YOU'RE SAYING AND I AGREE WITH 


[Captioner] 22:05:49
THAT AND I HAVE THE BENEFIT OF 


[Captioner] 22:05:52
HAVING GROWN UP HERE IN FREMONT.


[Captioner] 22:05:53
SO, YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN ABLE TO 


[Captioner] 22:05:55
EXPERIENCE A LOT OF THE 


[Captioner] 22:05:58
DIFFERENT CULTURES IN FREMONT, 


[Captioner] 22:06:00
WHICH HAS KIND OF SHAPED, YOU 


[Captioner] 22:06:02
KNOW, WHO I AM WHICH PREPARED ME 


[Captioner] 22:06:04
TO GO OUT INTO THE WORLD AND GO 


[Captioner] 22:06:05
TO COLLEGE AND EXPERIENCE THINGS 


[Captioner] 22:06:07
THAT MAYBE I HADN'T EXPERIENCED 


[Captioner] 22:06:09
BEFORE BUT I WASN'T LIKE OH THIS 


[Captioner] 22:06:11
IS SO FOREIGN TO ME BECAUSE I 


[Captioner] 22:06:13
HAD THE BENEFIT OF, YOU KNOW, 


[Captioner] 22:06:15
EXPERIENCING SO MANY DIFFERENT 


[Captioner] 22:06:15
COWMENTS.


[Captioner] 22:06:18
SO I HEAR -- CULTURES SO I HEAR 


[Captioner] 22:06:21
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING AND THE FINAL 


[Captioner] 22:06:24
THING I HAVE TO SAY THIS MAY BE 


[Captioner] 22:06:26
A GOOD TOPIC FOR OUR JOINT 


[Captioner] 22:06:27
MEETING WITH THE FREMONT UNIFIED 


[Captioner] 22:06:28
SCHOOL DISTRICT, BECAUSE 


[Captioner] 22:06:29
EVERYTHING STARTS WITH THE 


[Captioner] 22:06:29
YOUTH.


[Captioner] 22:06:31
THAT'S JUST MY TWO CENTS.


[Captioner] 22:06:33
AGAIN THE REFERRALS ARE A TWO 


[Captioner] 22:06:34
STEP PROCESS.


[Captioner] 22:06:36
YOU MAKE THE REFERRALS, YOU ALL 


[Captioner] 22:06:37
DECIDE HOW YOU WANT TO MOVE 


[Captioner] 22:06:38
FORWARD WITH THOSE REFERRALS AND 


[Captioner] 22:06:40
THEN YOU KNOW STAFF WILL COME 


[Captioner] 22:06:42
FORWARD WITH OUR BEST WORK.


[Captioner] 22:06:43
BUT THOSE ARE JUST SOME THINGS 


[Captioner] 22:06:46
THAT I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO 


[Captioner] 22:06:47
CONSIDER AS YOU DECIDE HOW TO 


[Captioner] 22:06:51
MOVE FORWARD THIS EVENING.


[Captioner] 22:06:52
>> Mayor Mei:   SURE, I HAVE 


[Captioner] 22:06:54
SOME COMMENTS BUT I'LL FOLLOW 


[Captioner] 22:06:55
YOU COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN, DO YOU 


[Captioner] 22:06:56
HAVE OTHER COMMENTS?


[Captioner] 22:06:57
>> Councilmember Salwan:   I 


[Captioner] 22:06:58
JUST WANTED TO ADD A COUPLE OF 


[Captioner] 22:06:59
OTHER THINGS.


[Captioner] 22:07:01
I KNOW LIKE THE OLIVE FESTIVAL 


[Captioner] 22:07:04
FOR EXAMPLE, I DON'T WANT TO SAY 


[Captioner] 22:07:05
IT'S DYING BUT THEY DEFINITELY 


[Captioner] 22:07:06
NEED MORE ATTENDANCE.


[Captioner] 22:07:09
AND THEY DEFINITELY HAD SOME OF 


[Captioner] 22:07:10
THESE KIND OF PERFORMANCES SO 


[Captioner] 22:07:12
THEY WOULD LOVE TO HAVE MORE 


[Captioner] 22:07:13
CULTURAL TYPE PERFORMANCES.


[Captioner] 22:07:15
SO RATHER THAN REEVENT A NEW 


[Captioner] 22:07:17
EVENT WE CAN PIGGYBACK ON ONE 


[Captioner] 22:07:18
THAT ALREADY EXISTS.


[Captioner] 22:07:20
SO THAT COULD BE ONE PLACE WHERE 


[Captioner] 22:07:22
THE CITY COULD MAYBE HELP 


[Captioner] 22:07:24
FACILITATE OR BRING THE PARTIES 


[Captioner] 22:07:27
TOGETHER.


[Captioner] 22:07:28
ALSO, THE SCHOOLS WAS A GREAT 


[Captioner] 22:07:30
IDEA, I THINK SCHOOLS LIKE YOU 


[Captioner] 22:07:33
SAID THE YOUTH ARE FANTASTIC FOR 


[Captioner] 22:07:36
DOING THESE KIND OF EVENTS.


[Captioner] 22:07:38
THE SISTER CITY WAS ABANDONED 


[Captioner] 22:07:40
BECAUSE THEY WERE NO LONGER 


[Captioner] 22:07:41
MEETING.


[Captioner] 22:07:43
WE DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO GO 


[Captioner] 22:07:45
BACK TO THE COMMISSION STRUCTURE 


[Captioner] 22:07:48
FOR THE THE SISTER CITY PROGRAM.


[Captioner] 22:07:50
YOU HAVE TO HAVE A NONPROFIT, IT 


[Captioner] 22:07:52
REQUIRES THE CITY TO SIGN OFF 


[Captioner] 22:07:54
THAT YES WE ARE THE SPONSORING 


[Captioner] 22:07:55
ORGANIZATION AND THEN THE 


[Captioner] 22:07:56
NONPROFIT CAN DO WHATEVER THEY 


[Captioner] 22:07:58
NEED TO DO SO WE DON'T HAVE TO 


[Captioner] 22:08:00
GO THROUGH THE FORMAL SISTER 


[Captioner] 22:08:00
CITY PROGRAM.


[Captioner] 22:08:03
I WAS A FORMER HUMAN RELATION 


[Captioner] 22:08:04
COMMISSION CHAIR.


[Captioner] 22:08:06
WE DID HAVE AN EVENT THAT WE 


[Captioner] 22:08:08
USED TO DO CALLED OUR COMMUNITY 


[Captioner] 22:08:09
WE ALL BELONG.


[Captioner] 22:08:10
>> Mayor Mei:   YES.


[Captioner] 22:08:11
>> Councilmember Salwan:   AND 


[Captioner] 22:08:13
THAT'S AN EVENT THAT HRC CAN DO 


[Captioner] 22:08:14
NOW.


[Captioner] 22:08:16
THEY DON'T NEED THE CITY TO 


[Captioner] 22:08:17
SANCTION ANYTHING.


[Captioner] 22:08:18
THEY CAN ORGANIZE, THEY CAN HOST 


[Captioner] 22:08:20
IT, THEY CAN BRING ALL THE 


[Captioner] 22:08:21
DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS TOABLG 


[Captioner] 22:08:23
AND THAT CAN BE DONE THAT WAY AS 


[Captioner] 22:08:24
WELL.


[Captioner] 22:08:25
REGARDING MUSIC IN THE PARK I 


[Captioner] 22:08:28
HAVE SO MANY FOLKS ESPECIALLY IN 


[Captioner] 22:08:31
BOLLYWOOD THAT WANT TO SPONSOR 


[Captioner] 22:08:33
AN EVENT, I'M SURE OTHER 


[Captioner] 22:08:35
COMMUNITY EVENTS AS WELL.


[Captioner] 22:08:37
SO YOU COULD HAVE I DON'T KNOW, 


[Captioner] 22:08:38
THREE OR FOUR DIFFERENT 


[Captioner] 22:08:40
ORGANIZATIONS SPONSOR A PORTION 


[Captioner] 22:08:42
OF ONE OF THOSE INTERNATIONAL 


[Captioner] 22:08:44
MUSIC NIGHT WITH WHATEVER THEMES 


[Captioner] 22:08:46
YOU WANT.


[Captioner] 22:08:48
INTERNATIONAL EVENTS, ANYWAYS, 


[Captioner] 22:08:50
LOTS OF EVENTS, I'M SURE STAFF 


[Captioner] 22:08:52
CAN PUT THAT TOGETHER IN A 


[Captioner] 22:08:53
FOLLOW UP DISCUSSION.


[Captioner] 22:08:55
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 22:08:55
>> Mayor Mei:   COUNCILMEMBER 


[Captioner] 22:08:57
KENG.


[Captioner] 22:08:59
>> Vice Mayor Keng:   THANK YOU 


[Captioner] 22:09:00
MAYOR MEI.


[Captioner] 22:09:01
I HEARD THE COMMENT THAT WE HAVE 


[Captioner] 22:09:04
EVENTS THAT CURRENTLY HAVE SOME 


[Captioner] 22:09:07
ELEMENTS OR TIDBITS OF 


[Captioner] 22:09:07
MULTICULTURAL.


[Captioner] 22:09:10
BUT AS WE SEE, I THINK SOMETIMES 


[Captioner] 22:09:12
ULG YOU JUST NEED TO GIVE IT A 


[Captioner] 22:09:13
PROPER NAME.


[Captioner] 22:09:16
IF YOU ARE TRYING TO DO A 


[Captioner] 22:09:18
MULTICULTURAL EVENT, CALL IT A 


[Captioner] 22:09:20
MULTICULTURAL EVENT THAN PEOPLE 


[Captioner] 22:09:21
WILL COME FOR THAT PURPOSE.


[Captioner] 22:09:24
IF YOU ARE TRYING TO I PIGGYBACK 


[Captioner] 22:09:26
ON OLIVE FESTIVAL IT'S ENTIRELY 


[Captioner] 22:09:28
DIFFERENT, IT'S VERY WHITE AND 


[Captioner] 22:09:30
LIKE EARLIER, I DIDN'T WANT TO 


[Captioner] 22:09:32
SAY LIKE OUR SUMMER CONCERT 


[Captioner] 22:09:34
EVENT IS VERY WHITE, RIGHT?


[Captioner] 22:09:36
WHICH IS -- IT'S NOTHING WRONG 


[Captioner] 22:09:39
WITH IT, BUT IT'S JUST NOT VERY 


[Captioner] 22:09:43
INCLUSIVE, OF OUR DIVERSE 


[Captioner] 22:09:43
COMMUNITY.


[Captioner] 22:09:47
BUT I FEEL LIKE FOR EXAMPLE OUR 


[Captioner] 22:09:48
RESTAURANT WEEK THAT, YOU KNOW, 


[Captioner] 22:09:51
THAT WE JUST PUSHED OUT, COUPLE 


[Captioner] 22:09:54
OF YEARS AGO, AFTER I SUGGESTED 


[Captioner] 22:09:55
TO THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE THAT 


[Captioner] 22:09:57
OH LET'S DO A RESTAURANT WEEK, 


[Captioner] 22:09:58
AND THEN BUT THEY DIDN'T WANT TO 


[Captioner] 22:10:00
CALL IT A RESTAURANT WEEK.


[Captioner] 22:10:04
THEY WANT TO CALL IT SUPPORT OUR 


[Captioner] 22:10:05
LOCAL RESTAURANTS WEEK.


[Captioner] 22:10:07
OR SOMETHING.


[Captioner] 22:10:10
AND -- BUT NOBODY -- YOU KNOW 


[Captioner] 22:10:12
IT'S LIKE IT JUST GIVE IT A 


[Captioner] 22:10:13
PROPER NAME THAT, YOU KNOW, 


[Captioner] 22:10:15
PEOPLE ALREADY KNOW, WHAT 


[Captioner] 22:10:18
RESTAURANT IS, OAKLAND, BY 


[Captioner] 22:10:20
CITIES, SAN FRANCISCO, THEY ALL 


[Captioner] 22:10:21
HAVE RESTAURANT WEEK AND THEN 


[Captioner] 22:10:23
JUST YOU KNOW IT'S STRAIGHT TO 


[Captioner] 22:10:25
THE POINT THAT IT'S RESTAURANT 


[Captioner] 22:10:27
WEEK TO CELEBRATE OUR 


[Captioner] 22:10:29
RESTAURANTS INSTEAD OF BEGGING 


[Captioner] 22:10:31
FOR PEOPLE TO COME SUPPORT OUR 


[Captioner] 22:10:33
RESTAURANTS.


[Captioner] 22:10:35
YOU KNOW, EVEN THOUGH THIS IS 


[Captioner] 22:10:36
NOT ONE OF OUR TOP THREE 


[Captioner] 22:10:39
PRIORITIES, WE CAN, YOU KNOW -- 


[Captioner] 22:10:43
I BELIEVE, YOU KNOW, THIS IS 


[Captioner] 22:10:45
PROVEN AND SHOWN IN THE LUNAR 


[Captioner] 22:10:46
NEW YEAR CELEBRATION THAT WE 


[Captioner] 22:10:48
JUST DID, IT DOESN'T TAKE A LOT 


[Captioner] 22:10:49
OF RESOURCES TO -- I MEAN YOU 


[Captioner] 22:10:52
GUYS HAVE TO PLAN AND STUFF BUT, 


[Captioner] 22:10:54
YOU KNOW, LIKE MONEY WISE AND 


[Captioner] 22:10:57
THINGS LIKE THAT, LIKE BECAUSE I 


[Captioner] 22:11:00
DID A LUNAR NEW YEAR CELEBRATION 


[Captioner] 22:11:02
THERE EXACT SAME TIME LAST YEAR 


[Captioner] 22:11:06
AND IT COST ME LIKE $1,000 


[Captioner] 22:11:06
RIGHT?


[Captioner] 22:11:08
BUT IT DOESN'T NEED TO SPEND A 


[Captioner] 22:11:09
LOT OF MONEY.


[Captioner] 22:11:11
WE COULD HAVE LIKE A 


[Captioner] 22:11:12
SUBCOMMITTEE, YOU KNOW, 


[Captioner] 22:11:13
DISCUSSED EARLIER, HAVE 


[Captioner] 22:11:15
COMMUNITY MEMBERS THAT WANT TO 


[Captioner] 22:11:17
SPONSOR, AND I BELIEVE WE COULD 


[Captioner] 22:11:19
EASILY GET SPONSORS FOR THIS 


[Captioner] 22:11:25
VERY MEANINGFUL EVENT THAT HAS A 


[Captioner] 22:11:27
LOT, YEAH A LOT OF MEAT BEHIND 


[Captioner] 22:11:28
IT.


[Captioner] 22:11:32
SO I'M SHOWING SUPPORT, I WOULD 


[Captioner] 22:11:35
LOVE TO SECOND IF YOU WANT TO DO 


[Captioner] 22:11:36
A MOTION.


[Captioner] 22:11:39
>> Councilmember Cox:   THANK 


[Captioner] 22:11:41
YOU.


[Captioner] 22:11:41
>> Mayor Mei:   COUNCILMEMBER 


[Captioner] 22:11:43
SALWAN DID YOU WANT TO SECOND OR 


[Captioner] 22:11:45
YOU HAVE A --


[Captioner] 22:11:46
>> Councilmember Salwan:   YES 


[Captioner] 22:11:48
IN THE INTEREST OF TIME IF WE 


[Captioner] 22:11:50
CAN JUST MOVE THIS TO STAFF SO 


[Captioner] 22:11:51
STAFF CAN REVIEW THIS AND COME 


[Captioner] 22:11:52
BACK TO US?


[Captioner] 22:11:54
OTHERWISE WE'LL BE HERE ALL 


[Captioner] 22:11:56
NIGHT DISCUSSING THIS.


[Captioner] 22:11:56
>> Councilmember Cox:   THAT'S 


[Captioner] 22:11:59
WHAT I WAS GOING TO SAY, I WOULD 


[Captioner] 22:12:01
LET THEM BE CREATIVE, WE KNOW 


[Captioner] 22:12:03
THE ENVIRONMENT WE'RE IN, THERE 


[Captioner] 22:12:05
ARE ALSO UNTAPPED SPONSORSHIPS 


[Captioner] 22:12:08
SHALL WE SAY THAT MAY BE ABLE TO 


[Captioner] 22:12:09
COME FORTH TO HELP SUPPLEMENT 


[Captioner] 22:12:11
SOMETHING WITH WHATEVER THE IDEA 


[Captioner] 22:12:11
THAT WE'RE DOING.


[Captioner] 22:12:14
I PUT IT OUT THERE AS A GENERAL 


[Captioner] 22:12:14
IDEA.


[Captioner] 22:12:17
BUT AGAIN IT'S JUST A PLAN THAT 


[Captioner] 22:12:19
WE ALREADY APPROVED BACK IN 


[Captioner] 22:12:21
MARCH OF 2022.


[Captioner] 22:12:23
BEFORE THESE OTHER NEW 


[Captioner] 22:12:23
PRIORITIES.


[Captioner] 22:12:25
SO I KIND OF FEEL LIKE WE'RE 


[Captioner] 22:12:27
KIND OF LEAVING SOME THINGS 


[Captioner] 22:12:29
HANGING IF WE -- YOU KNOW, IT'S 


[Captioner] 22:12:31
JUST ALLOWING US TO BE ABLE TO 


[Captioner] 22:12:34
BE CREATIVE, IN THE ENVIRONMENT, 


[Captioner] 22:12:35
YES WE KNOW ABOUT THE RESOURCES, 


[Captioner] 22:12:38
YES WE KNOW ABOUT THE STOMPS AND 


[Captioner] 22:12:40
THE CORE SERVICES THAT NEED TO 


[Captioner] 22:12:41
TAKE PLACE.


[Captioner] 22:12:43
AND I JUST SAY, IT WAS JUST AN 


[Captioner] 22:12:44
IDEA.


[Captioner] 22:12:46
BUT ALSO, THERE'S FLEXIBILITY.


[Captioner] 22:12:48
NOTHING IS WRITTEN IN STONE 


[Captioner] 22:12:50
EXCEPT THE IDEA OF THE CONCEPT.


[Captioner] 22:12:52
BUT, YOU KNOW, LET'S SEE WHAT WE 


[Captioner] 22:12:55
COULD COME BACK AND ALSO SOLICIT 


[Captioner] 22:12:56
VOLUNTEERS, OF COURSE IT WILL 


[Captioner] 22:12:58
THAT'S ONE OF OF OUR 


[Captioner] 22:12:58
PARTNERSHIP.


[Captioner] 22:12:59
>> Mayor Mei:   I WANT TO BE 


[Captioner] 22:13:01
RESPECTFUL, WE JUST HEARD OF 


[Captioner] 22:13:05
EVERYONE ON THE COUNCIL, 


[Captioner] 22:13:06
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN PUSH HER 


[Captioner] 22:13:08
BUTTON.


[Captioner] 22:13:11
WE HAD A MOTION AND SECOND, 


[Captioner] 22:13:13
GIVING GENERAL DIRECTION,.


[Captioner] 22:13:13
>> Karena Shackelford:   THAT 


[Captioner] 22:13:16
SOUNDS PRETTY SPECIFIC.


[Captioner] 22:13:16
>> Councilmember Kassan:   


[Captioner] 22:13:19
THAT'S WHAT I WAS GOING TO SAY, 


[Captioner] 22:13:20
I DON'T THINK WE CAN GIVE 


[Captioner] 22:13:22
DIRECTION WITHOUT VOTING ON 


[Captioner] 22:13:22
THIS.


[Captioner] 22:13:24
IF THERE ISN'T MAJORITY SUPPORT 


[Captioner] 22:13:25
FOR THIS WE CAN'T GIVE THIS AS 


[Captioner] 22:13:27
DIRECTION, I PERSONALLY DON'T 


[Captioner] 22:13:29
SUPPORT IT BECAUSE I DON'T THINK 


[Captioner] 22:13:30
IT'S A TOP PRIORITY FOR US RIGHT 


[Captioner] 22:13:32
NOW SO WE CAN'T MAKE A REFERRAL 


[Captioner] 22:13:34
UNLESS WE VOTE ON IT.


[Captioner] 22:13:36
WE CAN'T JUST GIVE DIRECTION TO 


[Captioner] 22:13:37
STAFF TO DO WHAT THE REFERRAL 


[Captioner] 22:13:39
SAYS BECAUSE WE-


[Captioner] 22:13:40
>> Karena Shackelford:   AND 


[Captioner] 22:13:42
AGAIN YOU ALL ALREADY HAVE DONE 


[Captioner] 22:13:44
THAT DIRECTION BY WAY OF THE 


[Captioner] 22:13:45
PARK MASTER PLAN AND THE 


[Captioner] 22:13:46
INTEREST OF THE COMMUNITY IN 


[Captioner] 22:13:49
HAVING MORE KIND OF 


[Captioner] 22:13:51
MULTICULTURAL COMMUNITY EVENTS.


[Captioner] 22:13:52
SO THAT DIRECTION HAS ALREADY 


[Captioner] 22:13:53
BEEN GIVEN.


[Captioner] 22:13:56
SO IT SOUNDS TO ME THAT THIS IS 


[Captioner] 22:13:58
A POLICY DECISION.


[Captioner] 22:14:00
AND I THINK THE DISCUSSION HERE 


[Captioner] 22:14:01
THIS EVENING WAS GOOD BECAUSE IT 


[Captioner] 22:14:05
GIVES US MORE IDEAS ABOUT HOW 


[Captioner] 22:14:06
TO, YOU KNOW, MOLD IT AND, YOU 


[Captioner] 22:14:08
KNOW, MAKE IT, YOU KNOW, MORE 


[Captioner] 22:14:13
INTO A MORE SPECIFIC TYPE OF 


[Captioner] 22:14:14
MULTICULTURAL EENT.


[Captioner] 22:14:16
BUT I THINK THAT DIRECTION HAS 


[Captioner] 22:14:18
ALREADY BEEN GIVEN BY WAY OF THE 


[Captioner] 22:14:19
PARK MASTER PLAN.


[Captioner] 22:14:19
>> Councilmember Cox:   BUT IT'S 


[Captioner] 22:14:21
NOT CLEAR THAT RIGHT NOW THAT 


[Captioner] 22:14:22
WAS IN THE REPORT WE APPROVED 


[Captioner] 22:14:24
AND THE CONTENT BUT NOW THE 


[Captioner] 22:14:26
THOUGHT IS, IS THERE SOME SORT 


[Captioner] 22:14:28
OF WAY THAT WE COME BACK WITH 


[Captioner] 22:14:32
SOME SORT OF A PLAN OF ACTION.


[Captioner] 22:14:33
>> Karena Shackelford:   WELL 


[Captioner] 22:14:34
THAT'S WHAT YOU ALL WOULD BE 


[Captioner] 22:14:35
VOTING ON TONIGHT.


[Captioner] 22:14:37
IF YOU WANT TO MOVE THIS ITEM 


[Captioner] 22:14:38
FORWARD WITH A MOTION AND 


[Captioner] 22:14:40
SECOND, AND ASK STAFF TO COME 


[Captioner] 22:14:43
BACK WITH SOMETHING THAT'S 


[Captioner] 22:14:45
MORE -- YOU KNOW, THAT IS AS 


[Captioner] 22:14:47
PRESCRIPTIVE AS YOU'VE LAID OUT 


[Captioner] 22:14:48
TODAY THEN THAT'S WHAT WOULD 


[Captioner] 22:14:50
NEED TO HAPPEN.


[Captioner] 22:14:53
BUT AGAIN --


[Captioner] 22:14:54
>> Mayor Mei:   WE'VE ALREADY 


[Captioner] 22:14:56
GIVEN.


[Captioner] 22:14:57
>> Karena Shackelford:   WHAT IS 


[Captioner] 22:14:58
HELPFUL TO US AS STAFF IS 


[Captioner] 22:15:00
UNDERSTANDING WHAT YOUR HIGH 


[Captioner] 22:15:02
LEVEL PRIORITY INTERESTS ARE.


[Captioner] 22:15:05
AND THEN ALLOWING US TO EXECUTE 


[Captioner] 22:15:07
THOSE THINGS.


[Captioner] 22:15:09
SO PLEASE JUST KEEP THAT IN MIND 


[Captioner] 22:15:10
AS YOU MOVE FORWARD.


[Captioner] 22:15:14
>> Mayor Mei:   OKAY SO PLEASE 


[Captioner] 22:15:16
VOTE THEN.


[Captioner] 22:15:18
>> The Clerk:   I DIDN'T HEAR A 


[Captioner] 22:15:18
MOTION.


[Captioner] 22:15:20
I DIDN'T HEAR ANY OF THAT, I'M 


[Captioner] 22:15:22
SORRY.


[Captioner] 22:15:22
>> Mayor Mei:   ARE YOU MAKING A 


[Captioner] 22:15:23
MOTION?


[Captioner] 22:15:24
>> Councilmember Cox:   I WAS 


[Captioner] 22:15:26
GOING TO MAKE A MOTION.


[Captioner] 22:15:29
>> Mayor Mei:   OKAY.


[Captioner] 22:15:30
>> The Clerk:   SHAO AND 


[Captioner] 22:15:32
CAMPBELL ARE ON HERE TO REQUEST 


[Captioner] 22:15:32
TO SPEAK.


[Captioner] 22:15:37
BUT DID I NOT HEAR A MOTION.


[Captioner] 22:15:38
>> Mayor Mei:   COUNCILMEMBER 


[Captioner] 22:15:39
SHAO.


[Captioner] 22:15:39
>> Councilmember Shao:   THANK 


[Captioner] 22:15:40
YOU MADAM MAYOR.


[Captioner] 22:15:42
I JUST WANTED TO SEE HERE SINCE 


[Captioner] 22:15:46
WE ALREADY HAVE THE DIRECTION OR 


[Captioner] 22:15:47
GENERAL GUIDANCE, YOU KNOW, IN 


[Captioner] 22:15:51
ALL THE APPROVED MASTER PLANS.


[Captioner] 22:15:54
TO BE VERY SPECIFIC IN THIS 


[Captioner] 22:15:57
REFERRAL, YOU KNOW, THE NAME, 


[Captioner] 22:16:00
THE MONTH, AND SO ON, WOULD BE 


[Captioner] 22:16:03
TOO MUCH OF A MICROMANAGEMENT TO 


[Captioner] 22:16:04
THE STAFF.


[Captioner] 22:16:06
BECAUSE AFTER AURAL, WITH OR 


[Captioner] 22:16:08
WITHOUT THIS REFERRAL, THE STAFF 


[Captioner] 22:16:12
HAS ALREADY TAKEN THE DIRECTION 


[Captioner] 22:16:14
THROUGH THE APPROVED MASTER 


[Captioner] 22:16:15
PLANS.


[Captioner] 22:16:18
AND ALL THE DISCUSSIONS, AND 


[Captioner] 22:16:21
TONIGHT, YOU KNOW, I CANNOT HELP 


[Captioner] 22:16:23
BUT NOTICE THAT MULTIPLE PEOPLE 


[Captioner] 22:16:28
CAME TO US COMPLAINING ABOUT THE 


[Captioner] 22:16:31
DETERIORATING SITUATION IN 


[Captioner] 22:16:33
NORTHERN FREMONT DISTRICT 1, 


[Captioner] 22:16:36
COMPLAINING ABOUT THE RISING 


[Captioner] 22:16:40
CRIMES, AND THE INABILITY FOR 


[Captioner] 22:16:43
THE LOCAL POLICE TO HELP THEM 


[Captioner] 22:16:45
FIGHT THE CRIMES.


[Captioner] 22:16:48
THAT ACTUALLY IS ONCE AGAIN A 


[Captioner] 22:16:50
REMINDER FOR US WHAT THE CITY IS 


[Captioner] 22:16:52
FACING RIGHT NOW.


[Captioner] 22:16:54
SURE, SHORT TERM, WE HAVE A LOT 


[Captioner] 22:16:55
OF NEEDS.


[Captioner] 22:16:58
YOU KNOW, STORM, FLOODS, AND SO 


[Captioner] 22:16:58
ON.


[Captioner] 22:17:01
LONG TERM, WE HAVE ALREADY SET 


[Captioner] 22:17:05
THE THREE STRAIGHT PRIORITIES.


[Captioner] 22:17:09
PUBLIC SAFETY BEING ONE OF THEM.


[Captioner] 22:17:14
SO BY ASKING THE STAFF TO, ONCE 


[Captioner] 22:17:17
AGAIN, DEVOTE ADDITIONAL TIME OR 


[Captioner] 22:17:18
MAYBE EVEN ADDITIONAL COST TO 


[Captioner] 22:17:20
WHATEVER IS ALREADY INCLUDED IN 


[Captioner] 22:17:24
THOSE PLANS, BUT, YOU KNOW, 


[Captioner] 22:17:27
DISTRACTING THEM FROM FOCUSING 


[Captioner] 22:17:29
ON THE CURRENT ISSUES AND 


[Captioner] 22:17:32
CHALLENGES AND PROBLEMS THAT WE 


[Captioner] 22:17:36
FACE, I STILL THINK IT IS NOT 


[Captioner] 22:17:38
THE WAY THAT THIS CITY COUNCIL 


[Captioner] 22:17:39
SHOULD GOVERN.


[Captioner] 22:17:43
WE SHOULD, IN GENERAL, TELL 


[Captioner] 22:17:45
THEM, YOU KNOW, WHAT, AND THEN 


[Captioner] 22:17:48
LET THE STAFF FIGURE OUT HOW.


[Captioner] 22:17:51
AND THAT IS ALREADY DONE WHEN WE 


[Captioner] 22:17:55
ALREADY PROVED THE GENERAL 


[Captioner] 22:17:56
PLANS, SO I JUST WANTED TO POINT 


[Captioner] 22:17:58
IT OUT.


[Captioner] 22:17:58
>> Mayor Mei:   COUNCILMEMBER 


[Captioner] 22:17:59
CAMPBELL WOULD YOU LIKE TO MAKE 


[Captioner] 22:18:01
A MOTION OR DO YOU HAVE ANOTHER 


[Captioner] 22:18:03
COMMENT?


[Captioner] 22:18:03
>> Councilmember Campbell:   NO, 


[Captioner] 22:18:05
I JUST HAD A QUICK QUESTION.


[Captioner] 22:18:06
BECAUSE I HEARD THAT THE PLAN IS 


[Captioner] 22:18:07
ALREADY IN PLACE.


[Captioner] 22:18:09
SO IF THE PLAN IS ALREADY IN 


[Captioner] 22:18:11
PLACE, DOES THAT MEAN THAT THE 


[Captioner] 22:18:14
STAFF IS WORKING ON IT NOW?


[Captioner] 22:18:18
>> Karena Shackelford:   THE 


[Captioner] 22:18:20
PLAN BEING THE PARK MASTER PLAN 


[Captioner] 22:18:21
IN WHICH WE HEARD FROM THE 


[Captioner] 22:18:23
COMMUNITY THAT THEY WANT MORE 


[Captioner] 22:18:25
CULTURAL AND ETHNIC EVENTS.


[Captioner] 22:18:27
AND SO THAT WAS INCORPORATED 


[Captioner] 22:18:29
INTO THE PARK MASTER PLAN.


[Captioner] 22:18:32
IT WAS NOT AS PRESCRIPTIVE AS 


[Captioner] 22:18:34
WHAT WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING THIS 


[Captioner] 22:18:36
EVENING.


[Captioner] 22:18:39
BUT WE DID HEAR VERY LARGELY AND 


[Captioner] 22:18:41
LOUDLY FROM THE COMMUNITY THAT 


[Captioner] 22:18:44
THEY WANT, EXCUSE ME, MORE OF 


[Captioner] 22:18:46
THOSE TYPES OF EVENTS.


[Captioner] 22:18:48
SO THAT'S WHAT STAFF IS LOOKING 


[Captioner] 22:18:49
AT.


[Captioner] 22:18:51
AND AGAIN AS I SAID A MOMENT AGO 


[Captioner] 22:18:52
THIS CONVERSATION HERE THIS 


[Captioner] 22:18:54
EVENING HAS BEEN VERY HELPFUL 


[Captioner] 22:18:57
AND VERY INSTRUCTIVE AS STAFF 


[Captioner] 22:18:59
MOVES FORWARD WITH TRYING TO 


[Captioner] 22:19:02
PLAN SUCH EVENTS, THAT MEETS THE 


[Captioner] 22:19:03
COMMUNITY'S NEEDS AND THAT MEETS 


[Captioner] 22:19:05
THE COMMUNITY'S INTERESTS.


[Captioner] 22:19:06
BUT NO.


[Captioner] 22:19:07
WE WEREN'T SPECIFICALLY WORKING 


[Captioner] 22:19:09
ON WHAT'S BEING DISCUSSED HERE 


[Captioner] 22:19:10
TONIGHT.


[Captioner] 22:19:12
BUT WE HAVE BEEN WORKING TOWARDS 


[Captioner] 22:19:15
HAVING MORE CULTURAL TYPE 


[Captioner] 22:19:15
EVENTS.


[Captioner] 22:19:18
HENCE THE LUNAR NEW YEAR EVENT 


[Captioner] 22:19:19
THAT RECENTLY HAPPENED.


[Captioner] 22:19:19
>> Councilmember Campbell:   


[Captioner] 22:19:21
OKAY, I SEE.


[Captioner] 22:19:25
SO THE DISCUSSION TONIGHT WOULD 


[Captioner] 22:19:27
HELP SET A FRAMEWORK FOR A MORE, 


[Captioner] 22:19:30
EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE DOING 


[Captioner] 22:19:32
CULTURAL EVENTS FOR MAYBE 


[Captioner] 22:19:35
RETHINKING THAT CULTURAL EVENTS 


[Captioner] 22:19:38
AND MAKING IT A MULTICULTURAL 


[Captioner] 22:19:42
IEFNT, THUS WE DON'T HAVE TO BE 


[Captioner] 22:19:45
THAT PRESCRIPTIVE.


[Captioner] 22:19:47
>> Karena Shackelford: EXACTLY.


[Captioner] 22:19:51
IT'S BEEN A REALLY GOOD 


[Captioner] 22:19:52
CONSTRUCTIVE CONVERSATION THAT 


[Captioner] 22:19:56
I'VE HEARD, AS WE MOVE FORWARD 


[Captioner] 22:19:58
TO INCORPORATING MORE INTO THE 


[Captioner] 22:20:00
EVENTS THAT WE PLAN THESE ARE 


[Captioner] 22:20:01
SOME OF THE THINGS WE ARE 


[Captioner] 22:20:02
 


[Captioner] 22:20:04
LOOKING TOWARDS.


[Captioner] 22:20:04
QUS.


[Captioner] 22:20:04
>> Councilmember Campbell:   


[Captioner] 22:20:08
BECAUSE YOU ARE ALREADY DOING 


[Captioner] 22:20:09
IT.


[Captioner] 22:20:10
OKAY.


[Captioner] 22:20:10
>> Mayor Mei:   COUNCILMEMBER 


[Captioner] 22:20:11
COX.


[Captioner] 22:20:12
>> Councilmember Cox:   YES, I 


[Captioner] 22:20:16
WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A MOTION THAT 


[Captioner] 22:20:18
WE ADDRESS SOME OF THE IN 


[Captioner] 22:20:20
INEQUALITIES IN THINGS THAT HAVE 


[Captioner] 22:20:27
BEEN BROUGHT OUT TO MAKE SURE IF -- THAT THE EVENTS THAT WE'RE 


[Captioner] 22:20:29
HAVING WHETHER YOU CALL THEM 


[Captioner] 22:20:31
MULTICULTURAL OR CELEBRATION, I 


[Captioner] 22:20:33
THINK WE'RE GETTING TOO DETAILED 


[Captioner] 22:20:35
IN THE NIEK ROW SCRIPT OF IT BUT 


[Captioner] 22:20:37
IT IS TO EMBRACE MORE COMMUNITY, 


[Captioner] 22:20:38
THAT ARE NOT WELL REPRESENTED 


[Captioner] 22:20:39
RIGHT NOW.


[Captioner] 22:20:42
AND AS INDICATED IN SOME OF THE 


[Captioner] 22:20:43
CONCERTS THEY DON'T HAVE PEOPLE 


[Captioner] 22:20:47
THAT LOOK LIKE MYSELF, OR OF 


[Captioner] 22:20:48
OTHERS.


[Captioner] 22:20:50
AND SO THOSE ARE THINGS THAT, 


[Captioner] 22:20:52
WHY I WROTE IT, BECAUSE OTHER 


[Captioner] 22:20:56
GROUPS ARE BEING LEFT OUT.


[Captioner] 22:20:57
AND IF WE DON'T HAVE THAT 


[Captioner] 22:20:58
DISCUSSION, YOU KNOW, I'M 


[Captioner] 22:21:00
FLEXIBLE ON THE REFERRAL BUT 


[Captioner] 22:21:02
IT'S GOT TO BE MORE INCLUSIVE.


[Captioner] 22:21:05
AND INSTEAD OF EXCLUSIVE.


[Captioner] 22:21:07
THAT CERTAIN GROUPS THAT ARE 


[Captioner] 22:21:10
LARGER, HAVE THE MONEY, HAVE THE 


[Captioner] 22:21:12
FUNDING, HAVE THE SPONSORSHIPS.


[Captioner] 22:21:14
BUT I'M SAYING WE COULD STILL 


[Captioner] 22:21:17
WORK WITH EVERYBODY, WE COULD 


[Captioner] 22:21:18
STILL BUILD PARTNERSHIPS, 


[Captioner] 22:21:21
WHETHER IT'S SCHOOLS, 


[Captioner] 22:21:22
PUBLIC-PRIVATE, THERE ARE WAYS 


[Captioner] 22:21:24
TO DICE AND SLICE IT BUT I THINK 


[Captioner] 22:21:26
TO LEAVE THIS ON THE TABLE AND 


[Captioner] 22:21:28
NOT TAKE SOME FORM OF ACTION IT 


[Captioner] 22:21:30
DOESN'T HELP US HAVE THAT 


[Captioner] 22:21:32
GUIDELINES OF AT LEAST, I'M NOT 


[Captioner] 22:21:33
SAYING EVERYTHING IS WRITTEN IN 


[Captioner] 22:21:35
STONE BUT IT'S SOME GUIDELINES 


[Captioner] 22:21:36
TO ALLOW US TO MOVE FORWARD TO 


[Captioner] 22:21:38
BE MORE OF AN INCLUSIVE 


[Captioner] 22:21:40
COMMUNITY.


[Captioner] 22:21:42
AND ALLOW OPENNESS OF 


[Captioner] 22:21:44
DISCUSSIONS AND DIFFERENT 


[Captioner] 22:21:46
PARTNERSHIPS.


[Captioner] 22:21:47
AND, YOU KNOW, SO IT'S JUST THAT 


[Captioner] 22:21:49
IF WE DON'T HAVE THE DISCUSSION, 


[Captioner] 22:21:51
NOT EVERYBODY WILL FEEL THAT 


[Captioner] 22:21:53
IT'S BEEN EMBRACED AND YOU COULD 


[Captioner] 22:21:55
CONTINUE TO DO SOME OF THE SAME 


[Captioner] 22:21:57
THINGS AND SOME ARE NOT FEELING 


[Captioner] 22:22:00
THAT THEY'RE INCLUDED IN PART OF 


[Captioner] 22:22:05
LIVING IN FREMONT AND CALLING IT 


[Captioner] 22:22:06
OUR HOME.


[Captioner] 22:22:08
SO THAT'S WHY I BROUGHT THIS TO 


[Captioner] 22:22:10
KIND OF HAVE A DISCUSSION BUT 


[Captioner] 22:22:12
ALSO TO KIND OF SET SOME 


[Captioner] 22:22:13
GUIDELINES THAT ARE HELPFUL TO 


[Captioner] 22:22:16
BE MORE INCLUSIVE.


[Captioner] 22:22:17
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado:   


[Captioner] 22:22:18
COUNCILMEMBER COX JUST FOR 


[Captioner] 22:22:20
STAFF'S CLARITY, YOUR 


[Captioner] 22:22:22
OBSERVATIONS WERE MIXED IN WITH 


[Captioner] 22:22:23
A MOTION.


[Captioner] 22:22:25
SO I WANT TO MAKE SURE WE 


[Captioner] 22:22:25
CAPTURE YOUR INTENT.


[Captioner] 22:22:27
YOU MADE AN EFFORT TO MAKE A 


[Captioner] 22:22:28
MOTION.


[Captioner] 22:22:30
ARE YOU MOVING YOUR REFERRAL 


[Captioner] 22:22:31
ESSENTIALLY FORWARD OR WAS IT 


[Captioner] 22:22:33
SOMETHING DIFFERENT?


[Captioner] 22:22:33
>> Councilmember Cox:   WHAT I 


[Captioner] 22:22:35
WOULD LIKE TO DO IS JUST DO A 


[Captioner] 22:22:36
SLIGHT ADJUSTMENT, OKAY?


[Captioner] 22:22:39
WOULD I LIKE TO MOVE WITH THE 


[Captioner] 22:22:42
REFERRAL -- I WOULD LIKE TO MOVE 


[Captioner] 22:22:43
WITH THE REFERRAL WITH SOME 


[Captioner] 22:22:48
ADJUSTMENTS OF GETTING MORE 


[Captioner] 22:22:49
INPUT, IN TERMS OF THE PLANNING 


[Captioner] 22:22:51
OF SOME OF THESE ACTIVITIES, SO 


[Captioner] 22:22:55
THAT THERE'S SOME WELL 


[Captioner] 22:22:57
REPRESENTATION OF OCCURRING WITH 


[Captioner] 22:22:59
OTHER COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN 


[Captioner] 22:22:59
LEFT OUT.


[Captioner] 22:23:06
AND BE ABLE TO, YOU KNOW, BE 


[Captioner] 22:23:08
ABLE TO PLAN SOMETHING AND COME 


[Captioner] 22:23:10
BACK WITH THE THOUGHTS OF HOW TO 


[Captioner] 22:23:12
MAKE IT MORE OF A -- WHETHER WE 


[Captioner] 22:23:15
CALL IT MULTICULTURE OR WHERE WE 


[Captioner] 22:23:17
CALL IT A MORE INCLUSIVE EVENT.


[Captioner] 22:23:20
SO WE'RE KIND OF MAKING IT MORE 


[Captioner] 22:23:22
GENERAL BUT HAVING A TRAIL WORK 


[Captioner] 22:23:23
THAT IT COULD BRING MORE PEOPLE 


[Captioner] 22:23:25
TOGETHER AND NOT LEAVE PEOPLE 


[Captioner] 22:23:26
OUT.


[Captioner] 22:23:27
>> Mayor Mei:   I WANT TO 


[Captioner] 22:23:29
QUICKLY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE HAVE 


[Captioner] 22:23:32
OUR DIRECTOR OF PARKS AND 


[Captioner] 22:23:33
RECREATION NOW, AND WE JUST 


[Captioner] 22:23:35
ADOPTED THE MASTER PLAN AND WE 


[Captioner] 22:23:37
HAVEN'T HAD A CONCERT SERIES 


[Captioner] 22:23:38
SINCE THAT TIME AND SO HOPEFULLY 


[Captioner] 22:23:41
AS WE'RE PLANNING THIS YEAR'S, 


[Captioner] 22:23:43
IT'S A LITTLE BIT EARLY NOW, 


[Captioner] 22:23:45
THEY'RE IN THE MIDST OF 


[Captioner] 22:23:47
STARTING, I DON'T KNOW HER EXACT 


[Captioner] 22:23:49
ROLE IN THIS BUT I KNOW WE START 


[Captioner] 22:23:51
INTERVIEWING THE BANDS IN THE 


[Captioner] 22:23:54
APRIL-MAY TIME FRAME IF I'M 


[Captioner] 22:23:56
CORRECT, MAYBE EVEN LATER BUT WE 


[Captioner] 22:23:58
HAVEN'T PUT TOGETHER THE SIX 


[Captioner] 22:23:59
CONCERTS TOGETHER YET THIS YEAR 


[Captioner] 22:24:02
WE ADOPTED THAT PLAN FOR THE 


[Captioner] 22:24:05
MASTER PLAN PARK PLAN, I WANTED 


[Captioner] 22:24:06
TO GIVE DEFERENCE TO ALSO THE 


[Captioner] 22:24:08
FACT I WANTED TO CLARIFY BECAUSE 


[Captioner] 22:24:09
I'M A LITTLE CONCERNED ABOUT THE 


[Captioner] 22:24:11
NOTE RIGHT NOW AND I WOULD WANT 


[Captioner] 22:24:12
EVERYONE TO FEEL THAT IF THEY 


[Captioner] 22:24:14
HAD A CONCERT OR THEY HAD A 


[Captioner] 22:24:16
FESTIVAL THAT THEY WANTED TO 


[Captioner] 22:24:19
HOLD WITH THE CITY, OUR STAFF IS 


[Captioner] 22:24:21
ALWAYS WELCOMING TO HAVING 


[Captioner] 22:24:22
PEOPLE PARTICIPATE.


[Captioner] 22:24:23
I DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S FROM 


[Captioner] 22:24:26
OUR CITY SIDE, THAT OUR STAFF IS 


[Captioner] 22:24:27
NOT WELCOMING.


[Captioner] 22:24:28
PERHAPS THEY HAVE NOT FELT THAT 


[Captioner] 22:24:30
THEY ARE REPRESENTED BUT I FEEL 


[Captioner] 22:24:32
THAT PEOPLE ALSO WOULD WANT TO 


[Captioner] 22:24:34
APPROACH OUR CITY IN TERMS OF IF 


[Captioner] 22:24:34
THERE'S BANDS.


[Captioner] 22:24:36
BECAUSE I KNOW THAT EVERY YEAR 


[Captioner] 22:24:39
WHEN WE DO THE CONCERT SERIES, 


[Captioner] 22:24:41
I'M NOT INVOLVED IN THIS JUST TO 


[Captioner] 22:24:42
CLARIFY FOR THE PUBLIC BUT THERE 


[Captioner] 22:24:44
IS A TRYOUT AND THERE IS AN 


[Captioner] 22:24:45
APPLICATION PROCESS TO THEM SO 


[Captioner] 22:24:47
IT'S OPEN TO ALL WHEN PEOPLE PUT 


[Captioner] 22:24:51
TOGETHER THE CONCERT.


[Captioner] 22:24:51
>> Karena Shackelford:   YES, 


[Captioner] 22:25:00
IT'S A TYPICAL YOU KNOW RFP, 


[Captioner] 22:25:01
COMPETITIVE PROCESS.


[Captioner] 22:25:03
SO ANYONE WHO FEELS LIKE THEY 


[Captioner] 22:25:05
CAN ADDRESS THE NEED THEY'RE 


[Captioner] 22:25:06
WELCOME TO PUT FORWARD, YOU 


[Captioner] 22:25:07
KNOW, A RESPONSE TO THE 


[Captioner] 22:25:16
PROPOSALS YEAH.


[Captioner] 22:25:19
SO I KNEEL LIKE WE'RE GETTING A 


[Captioner] 22:25:19
LITTLE BIT TOO MUCH INTO THE 


[Captioner] 22:25:20
WEEDS.


[Captioner] 22:25:23
AGAIN, YOU ALL JUST LET, YOU 


[Captioner] 22:25:25
KNOW, LET US KNOW WHAT THE 


[Captioner] 22:25:25
POLICY DECISION IS.


[Captioner] 22:25:28
AND THEN WE'LL FIGURE OUT HOW TO 


[Captioner] 22:25:32
MAKE THAT HAPPEN.


[Captioner] 22:25:36
BUT THE DAY, THE MONTH, WHO 


[Captioner] 22:25:37
PARTICIPATES AND HOW WE GET THE 


[Captioner] 22:25:39
PARTICIPATION AND ALL, WE'LL 


[Captioner] 22:25:40
FIGURE THAT OUT.


[Captioner] 22:25:41
IF THIS IS SOMETHING THAT MOVES 


[Captioner] 22:25:42
FORWARD.


[Captioner] 22:25:44
BUT AGAIN A REFERRAL IS A 


[Captioner] 22:25:45
TWO-STEP PROCESS.


[Captioner] 22:25:48
SO SHOULD YOU ALL DECIDE TO MOVE 


[Captioner] 22:25:50
THIS ITEM ALONG TODAY, WE'LL 


[Captioner] 22:25:51
COME BACK TO YOU WITH AN 


[Captioner] 22:25:53
ANALYSIS OF, YOU KNOW, WHAT IT 


[Captioner] 22:25:56
MAY LOOK LIKE, WHAT IT MAY COST, 


[Captioner] 22:26:00
WHAT WE CAN OR CANNOT DO SO IT'S 


[Captioner] 22:26:03
STILL NOT QUITE -- WON'T QUITE 


[Captioner] 22:26:05
BE A DONE DEAL TONIGHT IF YOU 


[Captioner] 22:26:07
DECIDE TO MOVE THIS ITEM ALONG.


[Captioner] 22:26:09
BECAUSE THERE ARE A LOT OF 


[Captioner] 22:26:11
CONSIDERATIONS THAT YOU ALL 


[Captioner] 22:26:12
MENTIONED ON THE DAIS IN TERMS 


[Captioner] 22:26:15
OF COST, RESOURCES, CAPACITY, 


[Captioner] 22:26:16
ONGOING CAPACITY AND ALL OF 


[Captioner] 22:26:16
THAT.


[Captioner] 22:26:18
SO THOSE ARE ALL THINGS THAT WE 


[Captioner] 22:26:20
WILL CONSIDER AS STAFF AND 


[Captioner] 22:26:22
PRESENT TO YOU AT A LATER DATE 


[Captioner] 22:26:24
IF YOU DECIDE TO MOVE THIS 


[Captioner] 22:26:24
ALONG.


[Captioner] 22:26:25
>> Mayor Mei:   WE HAVE A MOTION 


[Captioner] 22:26:26
ON THE FLOOR.


[Captioner] 22:26:28
DO I HAVE A SECOND OR IS THAT 


[Captioner] 22:26:30
WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO 


[Captioner] 22:26:31
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN?


[Captioner] 22:26:31
>> Councilmember Salwan:   I 


[Captioner] 22:26:33
HAVE A FLIGHT TO CATCH SO IF WE 


[Captioner] 22:26:35
CAN WRAP THIS UP IN FIVE 


[Captioner] 22:26:36
MINUTES, I NEED TO GO HOME.


[Captioner] 22:26:38
IF THOUGHT, I CAN LEAVE NOW.


[Captioner] 22:26:40
>> Mayor Mei:   OKAY.


[Captioner] 22:26:41
LET'S CALL.


[Captioner] 22:26:42

[Captioner] 22:26:46
BUT WHO SECONDED IT?


[Captioner] 22:26:47
COUNCILMEMBER -- CAN WE CLARIFY 


[Captioner] 22:26:48
THE MOTION AGAIN?


[Captioner] 22:26:49
I THOUGHT YOU WERE TRYING TO 


[Captioner] 22:26:51
MAKE THE MOTION.


[Captioner] 22:26:52
>> Councilmember Cox:   THE 


[Captioner] 22:26:53
MOTION IS TO MOVE FORWARD WITH 


[Captioner] 22:26:55
THE REFERRAL WITH ADJUSTMENTS 


[Captioner] 22:26:58
THAT CAN BE PROVIDED BY STAFF ON 


[Captioner] 22:26:59
CREATIVITY AND PUTTING INTO A 


[Captioner] 22:27:02
PLAN.


[Captioner] 22:27:03
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado:   AND I 


[Captioner] 22:27:04
DON'T THINK THAT REQUIRES AN 


[Captioner] 22:27:05
ADJUSTMENT TO THE MOTION.


[Captioner] 22:27:07
IT REQUIRES AN ADJUSTMENT TO 


[Captioner] 22:27:07
YOUR REFERRAL.


[Captioner] 22:27:09
I THINK STAFF CAN DO THAT WITHIN 


[Captioner] 22:27:10
THE REFERRAL.


[Captioner] 22:27:10
>> Councilmember Cox:   IT IS A 


[Captioner] 22:27:11
PLAN.


[Captioner] 22:27:13
IT'S JUST A PLAN.


[Captioner] 22:27:14
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado:   SO IF 


[Captioner] 22:27:16
IT'S OKAY WITH YOU THE MOTION 


[Captioner] 22:27:17
WOULD BE TO SIMPLY MOVE FORWARD 


[Captioner] 22:27:18
YOUR REFERRAL.


[Captioner] 22:27:20
WE CAN EXPLORE WHETHER THERE IS 


[Captioner] 22:27:22
A SECOND THROUGH THE MAYOR.


[Captioner] 22:27:23
>> Mayor Mei:   I BELIEVE THERE 


[Captioner] 22:27:26
WAS A SECOND THROUGH COMEJ 


[Captioner] 22:27:28
EARLIER.


[Captioner] 22:27:28
>> Councilmember Campbell:   CAN

[Captioner] 22:27:34

BACK WITH A PLAN AND PRESENT THE 


[Captioner] 22:27:42
PLAN AT A FUTURE CITY COUNCIL

THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 22:27:46

[Captioner] 22:27:47
FROM COUNCILMEMBER COX AND A 


[Captioner] 22:27:48
SECOND FROM COUNCILMEMBER KENG.


[Captioner] 22:27:50
I THINK.


[Captioner] 22:27:51
>> Karena Shackelford:   SO WAIT 


[Captioner] 22:27:52

[Captioner] 22:27:53

A DONE-DEAL.


[Captioner] 22:27:58
THAT'S SAYING COME BACK WITH A 


[Captioner] 22:28:01
PLAN TO MAKE THIS EVENT HAPPEN.


[Captioner] 22:28:03
AND WHAT I JUST TRIED TO CONVEY 


[Captioner] 22:28:05
TO YOU ALL IS THAT IT'S NOT 


[Captioner] 22:28:07
NECESSARILY A DONE-DEAL BECAUSE 


[Captioner] 22:28:08
THERE ARE A LOT OF 


[Captioner] 22:28:11
CONSIDERATIONS.


[Captioner] 22:28:13
THERE'S, YOU KNOW, ONGOING 


[Captioner] 22:28:14
FINANCING, THERE'S THE OUTREACH, 


[Captioner] 22:28:17
THERE'S THE ONGOING CAPACITY OF 


[Captioner] 22:28:17
STAFF.


[Captioner] 22:28:19
THERE'S THE RESOURCES.


[Captioner] 22:28:21

THAT WE COULD DO.


[Captioner] 22:28:34
SO PLEASE, JUST, YOU KNOW, 


[Captioner] 22:28:38
CONSIDER THAT WITH REGARD TO THE 


[Captioner] 22:28:43
MOTION AND RECOMMENDATION.


[Captioner] 22:28:44
BECAUSE THAT'S PRETTY MUCH 


[Captioner] 22:28:46
INSTRUCTING US TO COME BACK WITH 


[Captioner] 22:28:48
A PLAN TO MAKE IT HAPPEN.


[Captioner] 22:28:50
