[Captioner] 19:27:59
>> Mayor Mei: WELCOME, KATHY.


[Captioner] 19:28:04
>> GOOD EVENING.
KATHY KIMBERLIN HERE REPRESENTING

[Captioner] 19:28:08
 KATHY KIMBERLIN, COMMUNITY MEMBER.
GOOD TO SEE YOU ALL TONIGHT.
I WANT

[Captioner] 19:28:13
ED TO JUST TOUCH ON BRIEFLY ON THE

[Captioner] 19:28:16
 UNITED AGAINST HATE AND I REALLY WANTED TO SPEAK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THAT.


[Captioner] 19:28:20
YOU ALL RECEIVED A LETTER FROM KEITH PARKER AND IT WAS THE MOST BEAUTIFULLY WRITTEN

[Captioner] 19:28:25
 LETTER.
I COULD NOT DUPLICATE OR SAY ANYTHING BETTER THAN THAT, SO I WANTED

[Captioner] 19:28:29
 TO RECAP A LITTLE BIT OF THAT, BECAUSE WHAT HE CAPTURES IN

[Captioner] 19:28:33
 THAT LETTER IS WHAT I FELT AS WELL, GOING TO

[Captioner] 19:28:37
 THE FREMONT HABAD A COUPLE WEEKS AGO, TALKING WITH THE JEWISH COMMUNITY

[Captioner] 19:28:41
 WHICH I WORKED WITH FOR MANY, MANY YEARS, AND THE FEAR THAT THEY HAVE AND WHAT THEY'RE

[Captioner] 19:28:45
 GOING THROUGH, AND WHAT IT REALLY BOILS DOWN TO IS EVERYTHING YOU DID

[Captioner] 19:28:49
 TONIGHT ABOUT THE RESOLUTION, UNITED AGAINST HATE.
SO IN

[Captioner] 19:28:54
 KEITH'S LETTER, I WANT TO RECAP A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT THAT.
IN THE WAKE OF THE

[Captioner] 19:28:58
 SEPTEMBER 11TH TERROR ATTACKS, AMERICAN MUSLIMS WERE FACED WITH

[Captioner] 19:29:03
 HATRED INTOLERANCE.
THIS WAS WRONG.
DURING THE COVID

[Captioner] 19:29:08
 CRISIS CHINESE AMERICANS FACED IT AND THAT WAS WRONG.


[Captioner] 19:29:12
NOW JEWISH -- ALL THE PAIN AND VIOLENCE ASSOCIATED WITH THAT PLIGHT.
THIS IS WRONG TOO.


[Captioner] 19:29:16
IF WE ARE UNITED AGAINST HATE, THEN WE MUST BE UNITED AGAINST THIS AS

[Captioner] 19:29:20
 WELL.
WE MUST BE UNITED AGAINST HATRED AND INTOLERANCE IN

[Captioner] 19:29:25
 ALL FORMS.
IF WE DO NOT STAND AGAINST THIS, THEN WHAT DO WE

[Captioner] 19:29:29
 STAND FOR?
THEREFORE, WHEN WE RECONFIRM OUR COMMITMENT TO STAND AGAINST

[Captioner] 19:29:33
 HATE, WE STRONGLY ENCOURAGE THE COUNCIL TO ENSURE THAT ANY RESOLUTION INCLUDES LANGUAGE

[Captioner] 19:29:37
 THAT EMPHASIZES OUR OPPOSITION TO HATE IN ALL FORMS.


[Captioner] 19:29:41
AND KEITH AND I BOTH WORK WITH THE COMMUNITY, IT'S IN OUR HEARTS, AND WE HOPE THAT YOU

[Captioner] 19:29:46
 WILL TAKE THIS INTO CONSIDERATION GOING FORWARD AS YOU LEAD OUR CITY.


[Captioner] 19:29:50
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
[APPLAUSE]


[Captioner] 19:29:55
>> Ms. Gauthier: JOHN HINDS FOLLOWED BY BEN YEE.
>> THIS IS

[Captioner] 19:29:59
 ALSO CONNECTED TO STOP HATE WEEK.
AND IT'S ALSO INSPIRED BY

[Captioner] 19:30:04
 KEITH'S WONDERFUL LETTER.
THE ENGLISH WORD HATE TRACES BACK MORE

[Captioner] 19:30:08
 THAN 3,000 YEARS TO AN OLD INDO-EUROPEAN ROOT WORD, AND THROUGH

[Captioner] 19:30:13
 THAT ENTIRE LINE, IT HAS MEANT AN INTENSE EMOTIONAL

[Captioner] 19:30:18
 ANTIPATHY TO ANOTHER PERSON OR PEOPLE, ANY PEOPLE.
IT'S BAD FOR THE HATER FOR THEIR

[Captioner] 19:30:22
 OWN EMOTIONAL STATE.
IT CAN BE A STEP ALONG THE WAY TO DEHUMANIZING

[Captioner] 19:30:27
 ANOTHER HUMAN, AND A PRELUDE TOWARD ACTUAL VIOLENCE AGAINST THAT HUMAN.


[Captioner] 19:30:32
AS FOR ACTUAL VIOLENCE OVER THE LAST MONTH, WE HAVE SEEN ASSAULTS

[Captioner] 19:30:36
 AND MURDERS OF JEWISH PEOPLE, WE'VE SEEN WIDESPREAD THREATS OF

[Captioner] 19:30:40
 VIOLENCE, PARTICULARLY ON UNIVERSITY CAMPUSES FOR SOME REASON, AND IN THE FACE OF THIS

[Captioner] 19:30:44
 ACTUAL VIOLENCE, IT HAS BEEN APPALLING TO SEE OTHERWISE

[Captioner] 19:30:48
 THOUGHTFUL PEOPLE TWISTING THEIR MINDS INTO PRETZELS TRYING TO

[Captioner] 19:30:54
 RATIONALIZE THIS AS ANYTHING OTHER THAN THE

[Captioner] 19:30:58
 DEHUMANIZING PHILOSOPHY IT IS.


[Captioner] 19:31:02
SUBMITOPHOBIA.
IF WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AWAY FROM ANTISEMITISM, WE CAN ONLY PRETENT

[Captioner] 19:31:06
 TO OPPOSE HATE.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:31:12
[APPLAUSE]

AND THE NEXT SPEAKER ON ORAL COMMUNICATIONS?


[Captioner] 19:33:16
>> Ms. Gauthier: ARIA PRINCE.
FOLLOWED BY

[Captioner] 19:33:20
 YASH.


[Captioner] 19:33:27
CHENCHANI.


[Captioner] 19:33:33
>> GOOD EVENING, COUNCIL.
MY NAME IS ARIA PRINCE.
I'D LIKE TO

[Captioner] 19:33:37
 QUICKLY DRAW ATTENTION TO A RECURRING ISSUE AFFECTING OUR PUBLIC SPACE,

[Captioner] 19:33:41
 PARTICULARLY PUBLIC PARKS.
THE STATE OF THE TRASH CANS ESPECIALLY IN THESE AREAS HAS

[Captioner] 19:33:46
 BEEN A CONCERN I'VE NOTICED.
MANY ARE IN POOR CONDITION, MISSING

[Captioner] 19:33:50
 OR INSUFFICIENT IN NUMBER THAT LEADS TO

[Captioner] 19:33:54
 TRASH STREWN ALL OVER THE AREA.
I HOPE THE COUNCIL

[Captioner] 19:33:58
 TAKES NOTE OF THIS MATTER AND POSSIBLY EXPLORES SOLUTIONS TO MAKE SURE OUR PUBLIC SPACES

[Captioner] 19:34:01
 ARE ADEQUATELY MAINTAINED.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR YOU A TENSION TO THIS MATTER.


[Captioner] 19:34:07
>> Ms. Gauthier: THANK YOU.
THE NEXT SPEAKER IS YOSH.


[Captioner] 19:34:13
FOLLOWED BY KRISH PATEL.
>> HELLO, MAYOR MEI AND CITY

[Captioner] 19:34:17
 COUNCILMEMBERS.
IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE ABLE TO VOICE MY CONCERNS TODAY.


[Captioner] 19:34:22
MY NAME IS YOSH.
I WANTED TO BRING THE CITY'S TRAFFIC

[Captioner] 19:34:25
 AND STREET MAINTENANCE TO YOUR ATTENTION.
RECENTLY THE SECTION OF PASEO PADRE 

[Captioner] 19:34:30
NEAR AMERICAN HIGH SCHOOL WAS REPAVED AND REPAINTED.
I

[Captioner] 19:34:34
 THINK IT'S GREAT AS IT KEEPS OUR ROADS IN WORKING ORDER.
HOWEVER, THIS SECTION WAS

[Captioner] 19:34:38
 WORKED ON DURING PEAK TRAFFIC HOURS, WHEN PEOPLE WERE TRYING TO GET TO AND FROM

[Captioner] 19:34:42
 SCHOOL.
THIS CAUSED A LARGE TRAFFIC ISSUE BECAUSE THEY ONLY

[Captioner] 19:34:46
 HAD ONE LANE OPEN AN EVERYONE HAD TO MERGE.
THEY ALSO DIDN'T PAINT THE

[Captioner] 19:34:50
 ROADS UNTIL ABOUT A WEEK OR MORE AFTER, WHICH CAUSED ANOTHER ISSUE,

[Captioner] 19:34:54
 CARS ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE LANE WERE CLEARLY IN THE BIKE LANE, MAKING IT HARD

[Captioner] 19:34:59
 AND DANGEROUS FOR BICYCLISTS TO RIDE THERE, GOING TO SCHOOL.
IT'S

[Captioner] 19:35:03
 NOT HOW OUR CITY SHOULD HANDLE THE ROAD MAINTENANCE AND WE'RE RUNNING THE RISK

[Captioner] 19:35:07
 OF ACCIDENTS AND DAMAGES, SO I THINK THAT IN THE FUTURE, IF POSSIBLE, THE CITY SHOULD

[Captioner] 19:35:11
 BE MORE AWARE OF THE SAFETY AND TRAFFIC RISKS THAT ROAD MAINTENANCE MAY CAUSE

[Captioner] 19:35:15
 AND SHOULD PLAN BETTER

[Captioner] 19:35:19
 ACCORDINGLY, FOR INSTANCE, PAINTING ROADS AS SOON AS IT'S SAFE AFTER REPAVING IS

[Captioner] 19:35:22
 A MUST INSTEAD OF WAITING A COUPLE WEEKS.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIE.


[Captioner] 19:35:26
 YOUR

[Captioner] 19:35:30
 TIME.
>> Ms. Gauthier: KRISH PATEL FOLLOWED BY

[Captioner] 19:35:36
 SHIVASHI GANESH.


[Captioner] 19:35:42
>> Mayor Mei: WELCOME.
>> HELLO.
HELLO, MAYOR MEI AND CITY COUNCIL.


[Captioner] 19:35:46
IT'S MY PLEASURE TO VOICE MY ISSUES HERE.
MY NAME IS KRISH.


[Captioner] 19:35:50
I'M A STUDENT AT AMERICAN HIGH AND I HAVE A CONCERN ABOUT THE INCREASING HOUSING DEVELOPMENT IN

[Captioner] 19:35:54
 THE CITY.
IT'S A GREAT THING THAT MORE HOMES ARE BEING BUILT, BUT I'M WORRIED ABOUT

[Captioner] 19:35:58
 THE INCREASED TRAFFIC THAT WILL BE IN OUR ALREADY CROWDED STREETS IF WE DON'T

[Captioner] 19:36:03
 MAKE ADDITIONS FOR MORE CARS.
FOR EXAMPLE, THE COMPLEX BUILT IN FRONT OF

[Captioner] 19:36:07
 THE FREMONT CITY CHURCH WILL ADD TO INCREASING TRAFFIC ON FREMONT

[Captioner] 19:36:11
 BOULEVARD.
I HOPE YOU GUYS WILL MAKE ACCOMMODATIONS FOR TRAFFIC AND MAKE 

[Captioner] 19:36:15
SPACE FOR THE MORE CARS THAT WILL BE ON THE ROADS.
I HOPE THAT YOU'LL TAKE THIS 

[Captioner] 19:36:18
CONSIDERATION MOVING FORWARD, AS YOU CONTINUE TO LEAD OUR CITY.
THANK YOU AND HAVE A GOOD NIGHT.


[Captioner] 19:36:26
>> Ms. Gauthier: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:36:33
SHIVAJI FOLLOWED BY IKARIA.


[Captioner] 19:36:41
>> HI, GOOD EVENING, HONORABLE COUNCILMEMBERS.
MY NAME IS

[Captioner] 19:36:46
 SHIVAJI, CURRENTLY A 12TH GRADER AT AMERICAN HIGH SCHOOL.
THE ISSUE I

[Captioner] 19:36:50
 CAME HERE TO TALK TO PERTAINS TO THE CONDITION OF THE STREETLIGHTS AND LIGHTING IN MY

[Captioner] 19:36:54
 NEIGHBORHOODS.
FOR EXAMPLE, THE ONES NEAR FOREST PARK ELEMENTARY AND ARDENWOOD ELEMENTARY.


[Captioner] 19:36:58
FOR THE NEIGHBORHOOD SURROUNDING HERE OFTEN HAVE STREETLIGHTS

[Captioner] 19:37:02
 THAT ARE RUN DOWN AND COMPLETELY OUT

[Captioner] 19:37:06
 OF COMMISSION.
WITH THE COMING WINTERTIME APPROACHING, IT GETS

[Captioner] 19:37:11
 DARKER EARLIER AND THE NEED FOR THESE LIGHTS ARE INCREASING.
I WAS

[Captioner] 19:37:15
 WONDERING HOW WE COULD LET THE CITY KNOW ABOUT THIS PROBLEM AND I CAME

[Captioner] 19:37:19
 ACROSS A FORM ON THE WEBSITE ABOUT HOW WE CAN REPORT THESE LIGHTS, HOWEVER, I KNOW THAT

[Captioner] 19:37:23
 THE GENERAL PUBLIC DOES NOT REALLY KNOW ABOUT THESE FORMS OR THE FORMS AVAILABLE ON THE

[Captioner] 19:37:28
 WEBSITE IN GENERAL, SO HOW CAN WE GIVE MORE AWARENESS TO THESE

[Captioner] 19:37:33
 FORMS AND HOW CAN I GET THE GENERAL PUBLIC TO REPORT THE

[Captioner] 19:37:37
 STREETLIGHTS AND GET THEM FIXED?
THANK YOU FOR LISTENING TO MY ISSUES.


[Captioner] 19:37:41
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
NEXT SPEAKER, PLEASE.
>> Ms. Gauthier: AKARIA

[Captioner] 19:37:47
 FOLLOWED BY -- IS IT M

[Captioner] 19:37:52
 ADHU KUMAR?
>> GOOD EVENING, COUNCILMEMBERS.
MY NAME IS

[Captioner] 19:37:55
 AKARIA.
THE ISSUE I'M HERE TO ADDRESS IS TRAFFIC.


[Captioner] 19:37:59
I DO UNDERSTAND -- I WANTED TO BRING

[Captioner] 19:38:04
 UP THE ARGUMENT, THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS OF TRAFFIC CONGESTION, IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE IN OUR

[Captioner] 19:38:09
 EVERYDAY SOCIETY AND SEE MANY TIMES.
IT LEADS TO LESS PRODUCTIVITY,

[Captioner] 19:38:15
 MORE STRESS BECAUSE STRESS IN TRAFFIC IN GENERAL AND INCREASED TIME AND ONE OF THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS

[Captioner] 19:38:20
 IS THE -- I THINK THE POOR PLANNING OF ROADWORK.
IT OFTEN

[Captioner] 19:38:25
 HAPPENS AT POOR TIMES AND IT LEADS -- IT'S MUCH LONGER THAN IT SHOULD

[Captioner] 19:38:29
 BE, WHICH LEADS TO MORE PROBLEMS ON THE ROADS.
WHENEVER I'M DRIVING,

[Captioner] 19:38:33
 IT'S ALMOST EVERY OTHER DAY I SEE SOME PART OF THE ROAD BEING CONSTRUCTED AND THIS LEADS

[Captioner] 19:38:38
 TO MORE TRAFFIC, MORE CON SCRETION JETION AND I THINK THIS IS PROBLEM WITH JUST SOME BETTER PLANNING

[Captioner] 19:38:42
 COULD BE FIXED AND THAT COULD BE MUCH MORE BENEFICIAL TO OUR ROADS AND TO

[Captioner] 19:38:46
 EVERYONE DRIVING, CONGESTION TO SCHOOL, AND I DO UNDERSTAND THIS IS A DIFFICULT PROBLEM TO FIX, BUT

[Captioner] 19:38:50
 I DEFINITELY THINK THAT IF EVERYONE IS ABLE TO JUST PLAN BETTER, I THINK

[Captioner] 19:38:54
 WE CAN DEFINITELY FIX THIS PROBLEM.
THANK YOU, COUNCILMEMBERS.
>> Ms. Gauthier: THANK

[Captioner] 19:38:59
 YOU.
THE NEXT SPEAKER IS -- LOOKS LIKE

[Captioner] 19:39:03
 MADU KUMAR FOLLOWED BY SHAKIL.


[Captioner] 19:39:07
>> GOOD EVENING, COUNCILMEMBERS.
MY NAME IS MADU KUMAR.


[Captioner] 19:39:12
I AM A SENIOR AT AMERICAN HIGH SCHOOL.
AND EVERY DAY

[Captioner] 19:39:16
 I GO TO SCHOOL I SEE MULTIPLE HOMELESS PEOPLE ON THE STREETS AND IT KIND OF

[Captioner] 19:39:22
 CREATES NOT A GOOD ENVIRONMENT FOR STUDENTS TO STUDY IN.


[Captioner] 19:39:26
SO ACCORDING TO A PIT TAKEN IN

[Captioner] 19:39:30
 2022, FREMONT SAW 68% INCREASE IN HOMELESS

[Captioner] 19:39:35
 POPULATION, AND WITH THE COLD WEATHER APPROACHING, I'M CONCERNED FOR THESE HOMELESS

[Captioner] 19:39:39
 PEOPLE ON THE STREETS, AND I WOULD LIKE TO SEE STEPS BEING TAKEN TO ENSURE

[Captioner] 19:39:41
 THE SAFETY OF THE HOMELESS POPULATION DURING THIS HARSH TIME.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:39:51
>> Ms. Gauthier: THE NEXT SPEAKER, SHAKIL.


[Captioner] 19:39:57
FOLLOWED BY

[Captioner] 19:40:00
 BASEER.
>> GREETINGS, CITY OF FREMONT COUNCILMEMBERS.


[Captioner] 19:40:05
I'M SHAKIL.
I AM A SENIOR AT AMERICAN HIGH SCHOOL, AND THE ISSUE

[Captioner] 19:40:09
 I WANTED TO ADDRESS, IT'S NOT REALLY AN ISSUE, I THINK IT'S SOMETHING GREAT THAT FREMONT IS

[Captioner] 19:40:12
 DOING ALONG WITH THE CALIFORNIA AND BAY AREA.
IT'S ONCE AGAIN THE UNITED AGAINST 

[Captioner] 19:40:16
HATE WEEK.
I PERSONALLY BELIEVE THAT UNITED AGAINST HATE WEEK IS A GREAT ADDITION 

[Captioner] 19:40:21
TO FREMONT AND AS STATED EARLIER IT BEEN RUNNING FOR MANY AMOUNTS OF YEARS AND I BELIEVE THAT FOR

[Captioner] 19:40:25
 THE CALIFORNIA AND FOR THE BAY AREA, IT'S INCREDIBLY AMAZING.
NOW, THE ISSUE LIES IN THE

[Captioner] 19:40:29
 FACT THAT THE ENTIRE CITY OF FREMONT, PER WHAT I'VE JUST

[Captioner] 19:40:34
 READ HERE AND PER THE PEOPLE IN HERE PROBABLY KNOW ABOUT THIS UNITED AGAINST

[Captioner] 19:40:38
 HATE WEEK, HOWEVER, THE STUDENTS AT THE SCHOOL I GO TO, AMERICAN HIGH, THE STUDENTS

[Captioner] 19:40:42
 AT MANY OTHER HIGH SCHOOLS SUCH AS MISSION SAN JOSÉ, WASHINGTON HIGH SCHOOL HAVE NEVER

[Captioner] 19:40:47
 ACTUALLY HEARD ABOUT UNITED AGAINST HATE WEEK.
WHETHER IT IS BECAUSE OF OUR LACK OF

[Captioner] 19:40:51
 UNDERSTANDING OF THINGS GOING ON IN OUR CITY OR WHETHER IT'S THE LACK OF OUTREACH

[Captioner] 19:40:55
 AND COMMUNICATION BEING SHOWN TOWARD THESE STUDENTS, I BELIEVE THAT IN ORDER TO CHANGE A CITY AND IN

[Captioner] 19:40:59
 ORDER TO CHANGE THE PEOPLE, AND IN ORDER TO CHANGE THE UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT IT MEANS

[Captioner] 19:41:04
 TO HAVE HATE AGAINST A PARTICULAR GROUP AND HOW TO CHANGE DIFFERENT PEOPLE,

[Captioner] 19:41:08
 YOU NEED TO EFFECTIVELY TARGET THE YOUTH.
WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS THAT

[Captioner] 19:41:12
 YOUTH AND YOUNGER CHILDREN ARE THE MOST EXCEPTIONAL AND UNDERSTANDING AND

[Captioner] 19:41:16
 TAKING INFORMATION.
THE WAY I WOULD EXPLAIN THIS IS THAT WHEN YOU TALK TO A LITTLE KID, THEY 

[Captioner] 19:41:21
ARE MORE READY TO GRASP INFORMATION.
THEY DON'T HAVE A MASSIVE BIAS AND THEY DON'T

[Captioner] 19:41:25
 HAVE A MASSIVE UNDERSTANDING OF THINGS BEFORE THEM, SO WHEN YOU TEACH THEM GOOD THINGS AND GREAT

[Captioner] 19:41:29
 THINGS SUCH AS THE UNITED AGAINST HATE WEEK, THIS IS EXACTLY WHERE YOU ARE MAKING A DIFFERENCE.


[Captioner] 19:41:33
SO MY SOLUTION TO THIS WOULD BE, PLEASE TRY TO MAXIMIZE YOUR OUTREACH AND

[Captioner] 19:41:37
 COMMUNICATION TO THE STUDENTS OF MANY DIFFERENT HIGH SCHOOLS, ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS.


[Captioner] 19:41:41
THIS IS OF COURSE ALL BASED PURELY ON OPINION.
MAYBE THE OUTREACH HAS DEFINITELY BEEN 

[Captioner] 19:41:46
THERE, OF COURSE, AND I DO NOT FIND ANY FAULT IN THE OUTREACH WORK THAT YOU GUYS HAVE DONE IN THE

[Captioner] 19:41:50
 PAST.
I AM JUST SUGGESTING THAT WE TRY DOING MORE OUTREACH WORK TOWARDS THE

[Captioner] 19:41:54
 STUDENTS OF AMERICAN HIGH AND THE KIDS IN THE GENERATIONS BELOW SUCH

[Captioner] 19:41:58
 AS GEN Z IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:42:02
[APPLAUSE]


[Captioner] 19:42:08
>> Ms. Gauthier:

[Captioner] 19:42:12
 BASEER.
>> COUNCILMEMBERS AND EVERYONE, AS A CITIZEN AND RESIDENT OF FREMONT, I 

[Captioner] 19:42:17
WANT TO BRING MY CONCERN ABOUT THE CURRENT CONFLICT WHICH IS

[Captioner] 19:42:23
 HAPPENING, AND IT'S A HUGE DISASTER.
IT LOOKS

[Captioner] 19:42:28
 LIKE EVERY INNOCENT LIFE TAKEN IS A

[Captioner] 19:42:35
 TRAVESTY, AT THIS MOMENT WE STAND WITH ALL CHILDREN, 1 MILLION CHILDREN

[Captioner] 19:42:39
 MAKE UP HALF -- POPULATION OF GAZA.
WE

[Captioner] 19:42:43
 CALL FOR PEACE AND DEMAND THAT THEY

[Captioner] 19:42:47
 USE TAXPAYER FUNDS TO BE USED

[Captioner] 19:42:51
 IMMEDIATELY TO DE-ESCALATE AND STOP ANY ADDITIONAL LOSS OF LIFE.
WE CALL

[Captioner] 19:42:56
 FOR THE IMMEDIATE ADMINISTRATION OF BASIC SERVICES,

[Captioner] 19:43:00
 WATER, ELECTRICITY, FUEL,

[Captioner] 19:43:04
 TO PROTECT THE WELL-BEING OF CHILDREN AND FAMILIES.
IT'S

[Captioner] 19:43:09
 REALLY LIKE -- IT'S REALLY PAINFUL

[Captioner] 19:43:13
 WHEN THOUSANDS, MORE THAN 6,000 CHILDREN HAVE BEEN KILLED IN THE

[Captioner] 19:43:18
 LAST MONTH, AND WE SHOULD BRING OUR CONCERN

[Captioner] 19:43:22
 AND MENTION ALL THESE THINGS AS A

[Captioner] 19:43:26
 HUMAN, BECAUSE EVERYONE HAS -- I HAVE TWO

[Captioner] 19:43:30
 DAUGHTERS, WHENEVER I'M SEEING NEWS ABOUT THE CHILDREN THAT HAVE

[Captioner] 19:43:34
 BEEN KILLED, BOMBS, AIR STRIKES, AND SUDDENLY I

[Captioner] 19:43:38
 REMEMBER MY CHILDREN AND MY CHILDREN COMING

[Captioner] 19:43:43
 IN FRONT OF MY FACE, AND IT'S REALLY NOT GOOD.


[Captioner] 19:43:47
WE NEED TO RAISE OUR VOICE AND STOP THIS

[Captioner] 19:43:49
 BOMBING AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.
THANK YOU.
[APPLAUSE]


[Captioner] 19:43:57
>> Ms. Gauthier: THAT WAS THE LAST SPEAKER.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:44:01
THANK YOU FOR THE STUDENTS, I GUESS THERE'S

[Captioner] 19:44:06
 A GOVERNMENT CLASSROOM, THE EAGLES, THAT IS HERE THIS EVENING.
AND I KNOW IN THE

[Captioner] 19:44:10
 PAST, THEY'VE ASKED US TO SIGN THEIR AGENDA SO THEY CAN

[Captioner] 19:44:14
 MAKE SURE THEY ARE NOTED FOR CREDIT.
BUT THANK YOU FOR COMING TO SHARE.
I WANTED

[Captioner] 19:44:18
 TO NOTE --
>> Councilmember Kassan: CAN I MAKE A QUICK COMMENT?


[Captioner] 19:44:22
I'M SORRY, I'D LIKE TO MAKE A QUICK COMMENT?
>> Mayor Mei: CAN I

[Captioner] 19:44:27
 FINISH MY COMMENT FIRST?
THEN I'LL BE HAPPY TO SHARE.
I WANTED JUST TO NOTE THAT FOR THE

[Captioner] 19:44:31
 WEBSITE, THERE IS "REPORT A CONCERN," SO FOR MANY OF THE

[Captioner] 19:44:35
 ISSUES THAT YOU MENTIONED, WHETHER IT'S TRAFFIC LIGHTS OR PARK BENCHES, WE HAVE SEVERAL OF

[Captioner] 19:44:39
 OUR STAFF WHO ARE HERE IN THE AUDIENCE, BUT THEY HAVE NOTED YOUR

[Captioner] 19:44:43
 COMMENTS, AND WHILE I'M NOT ADDRESSING SPECIFICALLY THE RESOLUTION OF THAT, YOU CAN REPORT A CONCERN

[Captioner] 19:44:47
 AND ACTUALLY THERE'S AN APP FOR THAT.
IT'S A FREMONT APP, AND THAT

[Captioner] 19:44:52
 WILL ALLOW YOU THAT INFORMATION.
THERE'S ALSO UNDER HOMELESSNESS A RESPONSE THAT ALLOWS

[Captioner] 19:44:56
 YOU TO REPORT THE CONCERNS.
I'D ALSO RECOMMEND IF YOU'VE

[Captioner] 19:45:00
 NEVER BEEN, WE ALSO HAVE A JOINT MEETING THREE TIMES A YEAR WITH THE SCHOOL DISTRICT,

[Captioner] 19:45:04
 AND SO, THEREFORE, YOU KNOW, WE CERTAINLY WOULD LIKE TO PARTNER

[Captioner] 19:45:08
 WITH THE YOUTH AND I KNOW I SEE MY POLICE CHIEF IN THE AUDIENCE, AND

[Captioner] 19:45:12
 WE HAVE A YOUTH COMMISSION, AND SO THAT'S PART OF WHY IT BEEN FORMED, IS TO ALLOW US TO

[Captioner] 19:45:17
 HAVE THE OUTREACH WITHIN THE COMMUNITY, AND TO THEN

[Captioner] 19:45:21
 PARTNER MORE WITH OUR SURFBOARDE AND OTHER GROUPS THAT ARE OUT THERE

[Captioner] 19:45:25
 TO ALLOW FOR THAT AWARENESS.
BUT CERTAINLY THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR

[Captioner] 19:45:29
 TAKING THE TIME, AND WE ALWAYS APPRECIATE AS WE CANNOT BE EVERYWHERE IN OUR CITY THE OPPORTUNITY

[Captioner] 19:45:33
 TO HEAR FROM OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS.
AND I'LL TURN IT OVER NOW

[Captioner] 19:45:39
 AND -- SORRY?
>> Ms. Gauthier: SORRY, I RECEIVED AN ADDITIONAL CARD FOR PUBLIC

[Captioner] 19:45:43
 COMMENT, IF YOU WISH TO ALLOW IT.
>> Mayor Mei: SURE, I'LL LET COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN SPEAK AND

[Captioner] 19:45:48
 THEN I'LL LET THE PUBLIC SPEAKER.
>> Councilmember Kassan: THANK YOU.
AS THE SOLE JEWISH MEMBER OF THE

[Captioner] 19:45:52
 COUNCIL, I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE, YOU KNOW, DON'T INADVERTENTLY

[Captioner] 19:45:56
 SPREAD MISINFORMATION.
THE JEWISH COMMUNITY IN

[Captioner] 19:46:00
 OUR COUNTRY AS WELL AS IN FREMONT IS VERY, VERY DIVERSE.
AND

[Captioner] 19:46:04
 SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT HABAD

[Captioner] 19:46:09
 IS ONE ORGANIZATION OF JEWS, BUT THERE ARE MANY OTHER ORGANIZATIONS, AND

[Captioner] 19:46:13
 SO I HEARD SOMEONE SAY I WAS AT THE

[Captioner] 19:46:18
 HABAD MEETING LISTENING TO THE JEWISH COMMUNITY.
AND I JUST WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT

[Captioner] 19:46:22
 THAT ORGANIZATION DOESN'T REPRESENT THE ENTIRE JEWISH COMMUNITY.
WE'RE VERY,

[Captioner] 19:46:27
 VERY DIVERSE.
ALSO, I DO ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT

[Captioner] 19:46:31
 THAT IT'S ABSOLUTELY TRUE THAT THERE ARE HORRIBLE INSTANCES

[Captioner] 19:46:35
 OF ANTISEMITISM HAPPENING, BUT WE ALSO HAVE A LOT OF ISLAM PHOBIA

[Captioner] 19:46:38
 HAPPENING AS WELL, SO I JUST REALLY WANTED TO POINT THAT OUT.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.


[Captioner] 19:46:45
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
I APPRECIATE MY COUNCIL JOINING WITH THE COMMUNITY TO BE UNITED

[Captioner] 19:46:49
 AGAINST ALL HATE, SO I DEFINITELY APPRECIATE THAT.
AND AT THIS

[Captioner] 19:46:54
 TIME, I'D ALSO LIKE TO WELCOME THE OTHER SPEAKER.
>> Ms. Gauthier:

[Captioner] 19:46:58
 LITA?
>> Mayor Mei: WELCOME,

[Captioner] 19:47:02
 LITA.
>> THANK YOU FOR LISTENING.
I WANTED TO ALSO READ JUST A LITTLE 

[Captioner] 19:47:06
BIT OF KEITH PARKER'S LETTER AND THEN I WANTED TO ALSO MENTION MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE.


[Captioner] 19:47:11
WHILE WE CAN AND WE SHOULD DEBATE THE LEVEL OF

[Captioner] 19:47:15
 VIOLENCE THAT'S BEING VISITED ON THE PEOPLE OF

[Captioner] 19:47:21
 GAZA -- AS A RESULT OF THE ACTIONS OF OTHERS HALF A WORLD AWAY.
IT

[Captioner] 19:47:25
 IS A GREAT SHAME THAT THIS EVEN NEEDS TO BE SAID.
MY CHILD

[Captioner] 19:47:30
 AND OTHER CHILDREN HAVE HEARD COMMENTS FROM OTHER PEOPLE THAT

[Captioner] 19:47:34
 ARE INAPPROPRIATE IN A CITY THAT SHOULD NOT BE FULL OF HATE.
AS A CITY

[Captioner] 19:47:38
 COUNCIL, I WOULD LIKE YOU TO FOCUS ON OUR

[Captioner] 19:47:43
 CITIZENS HERE, AND TO KEEP ALLEVIATING HATE HERE.
I DO NOT BELIEVE

[Captioner] 19:47:47
 IT OUR JOB HERE AS A CITY COUNCIL TO BE MAKING ANY

[Captioner] 19:47:51
 RESOLUTIONS THAT MIGHT IMPACT EVENTS THAT ARE HAPPENING SOMEWHERE ELSE IN

[Captioner] 19:47:55
 THE WORLD, AND OUR FOCUS SHOULD BE, LIKE THE PROCLAMATION THAT YOU MADE, ON

[Captioner] 19:47:59
 OUR CITIZENS HERE.


[Captioner] 19:48:05
ISLAPHOBIA IS WRONG, ANTISEMITISM IS WRONG.
TODAY I

[Captioner] 19:48:09
 LED A WALK IN MEMORY OF THE WALK

[Captioner] 19:48:13
 THAT HAPPENED FOR DESEGREGATION.


[Captioner] 19:48:18
NO MATTER WHAT IT IS, ANY HATE IS WRONG, AND THE ACTIONS THAT YOU TAKE AS

[Captioner] 19:48:22
 A COUNCIL AND RESOLUTIONS THAT YOU MAKE RESOUND AND ARE

[Captioner] 19:48:26
 HEARD.
OFTENTIMES THEY CAN BE TWISTED, AND AS A

[Captioner] 19:48:31
 WONDERFUL SPEAKER FROM AMERICAN HIGH SAID, IT'S OUR YOUTH THAT WE DEFINITELY NEED TO

[Captioner] 19:48:35
 LOOK AT AND IMPACT.
WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THEY ARE SAFE AND

[Captioner] 19:48:39
 ANY WORDS THAT COME OUT OF OUR COUNCIL ARE THERE TO KEEP OUR CHILDREN

[Captioner] 19:48:42
 SAFE AND ANTIHATE EVERYWHERE, AND NOT SPECIFICALLY TO ONE GROUP OR ONE PLACE.


[Captioner] 19:48:46
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:48:56
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
AT THIS TIME I'LL CLOSE PUBLIC COMMENT, BUT I'D ASK

[Captioner] 19:49:01
 THAT EVERYONE RECOGNIZE OUR SPIRIT IN WHICH WE'VE ADOPTED

[Captioner] 19:49:06
 THE RESOLUTIONS, AND THE PROCLAMATIONS THIS

[Captioner] 19:49:10
 WEEK FOR AWARENESS.
AND I WOULD HOPE THAT THE FEELING

[Captioner] 19:49:14
 OF BEING UNITED AGAINST HATE IS NOT SOMETHING THAT WE NEED A WEEK TO RECOGNIZE.


[Captioner] 19:49:18
IT SHOULD BE SOMETHING THAT WE AS A CITY ARE ABLE TO SHARE WITH ONE

[Captioner] 19:49:22
 ANOTHER THE KINDNESS AND RESPECT FROM ONE ANOTHER AT ALL TIMES.


[Captioner] 19:49:27
WITH THAT, I'D LIKE TO CONTINUE WITH OUR REGULARLY

[Captioner] 19:49:32
 SCHEDULED -- WAIT, WE HAVE ITEM 2H IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY.
>> Ms. Gauthier: CORRECT.


[Captioner] 19:49:36
>> Mayor Mei: IF WE COULD PLEASE CALL THE SPEAKER FOR

[Captioner] 19:49:41
 ITEM 2H.
>> Ms. Gauthier: MARIE HUGHES.
>> Mayor Mei: THE

[Captioner] 19:49:45
 AWARDING OF THE CONTRACT FOR VALLEJO

[Captioner] 19:49:48
 MILL HISTORIC PICKLEBALL COURTS AND DOG PARK PROJECT.
>> GREETINGS.


[Captioner] 19:49:53
MY NAME IS MARIE HUGHES.
I LIVE IN NILES.
IN FACT I LIVE ON OLD

[Captioner] 19:49:57
 CANYON ROAD WHICH ENDS RIGHT ACROSS FROM VALLEJO MILLS PARK, SO

[Captioner] 19:50:00
 ANYTHING THAT HAPPENS THERE AFFECTS ME.
AND I GET TO OBSERVE IT QUITE A LOT.


[Captioner] 19:50:07
VALLEJO MILLS PARK IS KNOWN FOR TWO THINGS.
ONE IS EVERY

[Captioner] 19:50:11
 SPRING, IT IS COVERED IN WILD FLOWERS, AND PEOPLE COME FROM ALL OVER TO ENJOY

[Captioner] 19:50:15
 THEM AND PHOTOGRAPH THEM.
IT'S ALSO KNOWN AS A

[Captioner] 19:50:19
 HOMELESS ENCAMPMENT.
IT'S HAD HOMELESS PEOPLE THERE AS LONG AS I'VE LIVED

[Captioner] 19:50:24
 IN NILES.
RIGHT NOW, IT'S MOSTLY RVs.


[Captioner] 19:50:28
THEY'RE TUCKED AWAY IN A CORNER WHERE YOU REALLY CAN'T SEE THEM UNLESS YOU LOOK, AND THEY

[Captioner] 19:50:33
 HAVE A STRONG COMMUNITY WHERE THEY THROW OUT ANY TROUBLEMAKERS

[Captioner] 19:50:36
 RIGHT AWAY.
MY NEIGHBORS AND I ARE NOT PARTICULARLY WORRIED ABOUT THEM.


[Captioner] 19:50:41
WHAT WE ARE WORRIED ABOUT IS WHERE THEY WILL GO IF YOU PUT IN A

[Captioner] 19:50:46
 DOG PARK AND A PICKLEBALL COURT.
THERE HAVE BEEN TIMES

[Captioner] 19:50:51
 WHEN THE COUNCIL HAS MADE THINGS DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE IN RVs TO PARK

[Captioner] 19:50:55
 SOMEWHERE, AND NOW YOU'RE TAKING AWAY ANOTHER PLACE FOR THEM.


[Captioner] 19:51:00
SO I WOULD LIKE YOU TO RECONSIDER THIS PLAN, AND COME

[Captioner] 19:51:04
 UP WITH SOMETHING THAT AT A MINIMUM ALLOWS THE

[Captioner] 19:51:10
 HOMELESS PEOPLE EITHER ANOTHER PLACE TO LIVE OR TO

[Captioner] 19:51:14
 BE THERE UNDISTURBED, AND ALSO IF POSSIBLE, TO PRESERVE AS MUCH OF

[Captioner] 19:51:19
 THE WILD FLOWERS AS POSSIBLE.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:51:25
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS.
ARE THERE

[Captioner] 19:51:29
 ANY COMMENTS OR A MOTION FROM THE COUNCIL?


[Captioner] 19:51:33
THIS IS ITEM 2H AS IN HENRY.
COUNCILMEMBER KENG.


[Captioner] 19:51:38
>> Councilmember Keng: THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR.
I'D LIKE TO SEE IF STAFF CAN

[Captioner] 19:51:43
 SHARE WHAT OUR PLANS IN KIND OF

[Captioner] 19:51:48
 HELPING OR PROVIDING ROW SOURCES FOR

[Captioner] 19:51:52
 THE CURRENT -- THE RV RESIDENTS IN

[Captioner] 19:51:57
 THE AREA BEFORE WE START KIND OF ESTABLISHING THE PARK.


[Captioner] 19:52:10
>> Mayor Mei: I SEE -- IS MISS

[Captioner] 19:52:15
 FLORES --
>> BRIEFLY, COUNCILMEMBER KENG, STAFF ARE HERE TO PROVIDE A

[Captioner] 19:52:20
 DETAILED EXPLANATION IF NECESSARY, BUT THE SHORT ANSWER IS THAT

[Captioner] 19:52:24
 WE ARE EXPANDING THE CITY'S TRADITIONAL WINTER

[Captioner] 19:52:28
 SHELTER MODEL, WHICH WILL

[Captioner] 19:52:32
 ACCOMMODATE FOLKS FOR A PERIOD OF FIVE

[Captioner] 19:52:37
 MONTHS?
UNTIL THE END OF APRIL.
IT WILL

[Captioner] 19:52:41
 ALSO PROVIDE THOSE RESIDENTS DISPLACED FROM VALEO

[Captioner] 19:52:46
 MILL WITH SUPPORTIVE SERVICES IN AN ATTEMPT TO HELP RESOLVE THEIR

[Captioner] 19:52:50
 HOMELESSNESS.
THE INTENT IS

[Captioner] 19:52:55
 TO EXPAND THE WINTER SHELTER PROGRAM SUFFICIENTLY

[Captioner] 19:52:59
 TO ACCOMMODATE ALL OF THE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE DISPLACED BY

[Captioner] 19:53:04
 THE VALLEJO MILL REDEVELOPMENT.
IF YOU

[Captioner] 19:53:08
 NEED ADDITIONAL DETAIL, STAFF IS AVAILABLE TO PROVIDE IT.


[Captioner] 19:53:12
>> Councilmember Keng: GREAT, THANK YOU.
I THINK MAYBE IN THE LAST YEAR OR SO, 

[Captioner] 19:53:17
WE ACTUALLY HAD A REDUCTION OF THE WINTER SHELTER PROGRAM,

[Captioner] 19:53:21
 AND I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT WE ARE KIND OF GETTING MORE FUNDING TO PROVIDE MORE

[Captioner] 19:53:26
 RESOURCES, ESPECIALLY DURING WINTERTIME, WHERE IT'S MOST NEEDED.


[Captioner] 19:53:30
THANK YOU.
>> THANK YOU.
COUNCILMEMBER

[Captioner] 19:53:33
 SALWAN, ARE YOU MAKING A MOTION?
OTHERWISE I HAVE SOME COMMENTS TO ADD.


[Captioner] 19:53:37
OKAY, I'LL GO AHEAD AND ADD SOME COMMENTS.
I KNOW THAT WE'VE HAD IN THE PAST 

[Captioner] 19:53:42
EXPANDED OUR WINTER SHELTER.
IT USED TO BE ONLY DURING DAYS WHERE IT WAS INCLEMENT,

[Captioner] 19:53:46
 BELOW 40 DEGREES OR RAINING, AN DURING MY TENURE, I KNOW WE AS A COUNCIL HAVE

[Captioner] 19:53:50
 TAKEN ON, SO IT'S EVERY DAY FROM NOVEMBER THROUGH MARCH.
UNFORTUNATELY WHEN THE

[Captioner] 19:53:55
 PANDEMIC HIT, WE ALSO HAD TO MITIGATE AND MOVE TO A DIFFERENT MODEL THAT

[Captioner] 19:53:59
 THE COUNTY WANTED US TO CONSIDER BECAUSE OF SAFETY.
I UNDERSTAND THAT WITH THIS

[Captioner] 19:54:03
 TRANSITION AND THIS PLAN FOR THE VALLEJO MILLS

[Captioner] 19:54:07
 HISTORICAL PARK, ONE, IT'S ALWAYS BEEN A PARK ASSET, AND ONE OF THE

[Captioner] 19:54:11
 THINGS THAT WE JUST UPDATED IS THE 25-YEAR MASTER PLAN, SO WE NING IT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR

[Captioner] 19:54:15
 OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE PUBLIC FACILITIES THAT

[Captioner] 19:54:19
 ARE DESIGNED FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO RECREATE, AND I KNOW THAT THIS WAS DONE IN

[Captioner] 19:54:23
 CONCERT WITH A LOT OF THE MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO LOOK AT WHAT WERE SOME OF THE HOPES THAT THEY

[Captioner] 19:54:28
 WANTED FOR THE RESOURCES.
AND UNDERSTANDING ALSO AT THE SAME

[Captioner] 19:54:31
 TIME, OUR COMPASSION THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS EVENING, I KNOW THAT

[Captioner] 19:54:36
 THE HUMAN SERVICES DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN OUT THERE MANY TIMES AND I KNOW THAT WE HAVE OUR

[Captioner] 19:54:40
 DIRECTOR HERE AS WELL AS THE LEAD IN THAT

[Captioner] 19:54:44
 AREA, LAURIE FLORES, WHO'S BEEN INCREDIBLE IN TERMS OF TRYING TO REACH OUT TO THE

[Captioner] 19:54:49
 MEMBERS, AND SO WE ARE WORKING IN CONCERT, AND I KNOW THAT I BELIEVE IN THE

[Captioner] 19:54:55
 BRIEFINGS THAT EACH THE COUNCILMEMBERS AND I HAVE HAD, WE'VE HAD SOME

[Captioner] 19:54:59
 DISCUSSIONS AND CONVERSATIONS OF HOW WE HAVE MADE THIS A VERY LONG TERM TRANSITION --

[Captioner] 19:55:03
 NOT LONG TERM BUT IN TERMS OF WE'RE STARTING RIGHT NOW AND I BELIEVE IN JANUARY IS

[Captioner] 19:55:07
 WHEN WE'RE GOING TO TOTALLY CLOSE DOWN THAT AREA TO ALLOW FOR CONSTRUCTION.
I

[Captioner] 19:55:11
 DO LOVE THE FLOWERS THERE TOO AND I'VE SEEN THEM VERY MUCH OVER THE YEARS AND

[Captioner] 19:55:15
 WE WANT PEOPLE TO CONTINUE

[Captioner] 19:55:19
 TO ENJOY.
I'M LOOKING AT THE DIRECTOR OF OUR COMMUNITY SERVICES, AND I KNOW THAT'S 

[Captioner] 19:55:23
SOMETHING WE ARE ALSO CONSIDERING.
SO WHEN POSSIBLE, YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE

[Captioner] 19:55:27
 CHALLENGES WE TALKED ABOUT UNITED, WHETHER IT'S UNITED AGAINST HATE OR

[Captioner] 19:55:32
 UNITED FOR LOVE IN TERMS OF OUR COMMUNITY AND PARKS, THIS IS

[Captioner] 19:55:35
 SOMETHING THAT WE'RE CONSIDERING, SO WE HOPE THAT THE COMMUNITY MEMBERS WILL HELP.


[Captioner] 19:55:40
FOR THOSE WHO WANT TO HELP ALSO WE JUST UPDATED OUR LIST

[Captioner] 19:55:44
 OF ITEMS, AND THIS INCLUDES THE STUDENTS BECAUSE I'M SPEAKING TO ALL OF YOU WHO ARE OUT THERE, IF YOU

[Captioner] 19:55:48
 WANT TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE, WE HAVE A LOT OF THINGS THAT WE NEED HELP WITH.


[Captioner] 19:55:53
AND SO IN COLLECTING THOSE ITEMS, IT DOESN'T JUST MEAN DONATING

[Captioner] 19:55:57
 OF MONEY, WHICH I THINK IS ONE WAY TO DO IT, BUT IT'S ALSO DONATION OF TIME, AND

[Captioner] 19:56:01
 WE ACTUALLY HAVE ON OUR WEBSITE ALSO A GIVING HOPE OPTION.


[Captioner] 19:56:06
SO WE'D LOVE TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO CONSIDER THAT AS AN OPTION TOO.
AND WITH THAT, COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN,

[Captioner] 19:56:10
 DID YOU WANT TO MAKE THE MOTION OR DID YOU HAVE ANOTHER COMMENT?
>> Councilmember Salwan:

[Captioner] 19:56:15
 I APPRECIATE ALL THE COMMENT AND FEEDBACK.
WITH THAT, I'D LIKE TO GO AHEAD AND 

[Captioner] 19:56:17
MOVE THIS ITEM FORWARD.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
WE HAVE A MOTION.


[Captioner] 19:56:37
I HAVE

[Captioner] 19:56:37
 A SECOND?
SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:56:37
PLEASE VOTE.
AND

[Captioner] 19:56:37
 ITEM 2H PASSES UNANIMOUSLY WITH ALL COMMENTS WE APPRECIATE NOTED.


[Captioner] 19:56:38
NEXT ON OUR AGENDA ITEM THIS EVENING IS ITEM 5A, WHICH

[Captioner] 19:56:43
 IS 2023 CODE UPDATES.
AND I KNOW SOME PEOPLE HAD ASKED ABOUT

[Captioner] 19:56:47
 HOUSING, AND THIS IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE ARE REQUIRED TO DO, IS HAVE

[Captioner] 19:56:51
 A HOUSING ELEMENT PROGRAM.
AND THIS IS AN UPDATE TO OUR GENERAL PLAN,

[Captioner] 19:56:55
 AND WE'VE GOTTEN THE HOUSING ELEMENT PASSED AS TO HOW WE WILL BE

[Captioner] 19:56:59
 UPDATING THOSE IN OUR COMMUNITIES, AND THIS INCLUDES SOME OF THE CODES THAT

[Captioner] 19:57:04
 HAVE BEEN SET THROUGH NEW LEGISLATION, AS WELL AS NEW ORDINANCES THAT COME THROUGHOUT FROM THE STATE OF

[Captioner] 19:57:08
 CALIFORNIA.
SO WITH THAT, I'D LIKE TO WELCOME DEPUTY

[Captioner] 19:57:14
 CITY MANAGER --

[Captioner] 19:57:19
 ASSOCIATE PLANNER PATEL AND ALSO OUR PLANNING MANAGER, JOEL PULLEN.


[Captioner] 19:57:24
SORRY, LOOKING AHEAD.


[Captioner] 19:57:37
THANK YOU FOR THE CODE UPDATE.
>> TONIGHT YOU ARE

[Captioner] 19:57:42
 CONSIDERING TEXT AMENDMENTS TO THE FREMONT MUNICIPAL CODE OR THE

[Captioner] 19:57:47
 FMC, AS WELL AS MINOR AMENDMENTS TO THE CITY'S VARIOUS DESIGN

[Captioner] 19:57:51
 GUIDELINES.


[Captioner] 19:57:58
SO WHY THE TEXT AMENDMENTS AND CHANGES TO THE GUIDELINES BEING PROPOSED?


[Captioner] 19:58:02
TWO REASONS.
ONE, BECAUSE THE CITY NEEDS TO MAKE GOOD ON THE COMMITMENTS IT MADE IN

[Captioner] 19:58:06
 ITS HOUSING EL EM, AND TWO, PERHAPS

[Captioner] 19:58:10
 MORE IMPORTANTLY, CLEAN UP THE CITY'S CODE TO COMPLY WITH STATE

[Captioner] 19:58:14
 LAW.
WHICH ENTAILS REMOVING REGULATIONS THAT ARE

[Captioner] 19:58:20
 NOT ENFORCEABLE, AS WELL AS PROVISIONS

[Captioner] 19:58:25
 THAT ARE MANDATED UNDER STATE LAW.
THE CITY NEEDS TO ADOPT THE PROPOSED CHANGES TO

[Captioner] 19:58:29
 ENSURE FAIRNESS, AVOID LEGAL CHALLENGES, AND REMAIN ELIGIBLE

[Captioner] 19:58:34
 FOR POTENTIAL FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES.


[Captioner] 19:58:39
AS YOU'RE AWARE, STATE LAW REQUIRES THE CITY TO ADOPT A

[Captioner] 19:58:44
 HOUSING ELEMENT.
THE HOUSING ELEMENT IS NOT ONLY A KEY PLANNING DOCUMENT FOR THE

[Captioner] 19:58:48
 CITY, BUT IT ALSO REQUIRES IMPLEMENTATION.
THIS SLIDE

[Captioner] 19:58:53
 IS INTENDED TO CAPTURE THE PROCESS AND LIFE OF THE CITY'S SIX-CYCLE

[Captioner] 19:58:57
 HOUSING ELEMENT, WHICH COVERS THE PLANNING PERIOD FROM

[Captioner] 19:59:02
 YEARS 2023 TO 2031.
IT TOOK OVER A YEAR AND NEARLY TWO DOZEN COMMUNITY

[Captioner] 19:59:06
 ENGAGEMENT EVENTS TO PREPARE THE HOUSING ELEMENT.
AND THE CITY COUNCIL ADOPTED THE

[Captioner] 19:59:10
 HOUSING ELEMENT EARLIER THIS YEAR.
AFTER ITS

[Captioner] 19:59:15
 ADOPTION, STAFF SUBMITTED THE HOUSING ELEMENT TO THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY

[Captioner] 19:59:20
 DEVELOPMENT, OR HCD, FOR ITS REVIEW, AND THEN IN MARCH OF THIS YEAR,

[Captioner] 19:59:24
 THE STATE GAVE THE OFFICIAL STAMP OF APPROVAL BY CERTIFYING THE CITY'S HOUSING ELEMENT.


[Captioner] 19:59:30
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE HOUSING ELEMENT STARTS FROM THE DATE THE DOCUMENT WAS

[Captioner] 19:59:35
 ADOPTED, AND RUNS THROUGH THE EIGHT-YEAR PLANNING PERIOD TO 2031.


[Captioner] 19:59:39
AS PART OF THIS IMPLEMENTATION PHASE, THE CITY IS REQUIRED TO UPDATE

[Captioner] 19:59:43
 ITS REGULATIONS TO COMPLY WITH STATE LAW.
TONIGHT

[Captioner] 19:59:48
 IS THE FIRST SERIES OF THE FMC UPDATE, AND THIS TYPE OF EXERCISE

[Captioner] 19:59:52
 WILL CONTINUE TO TAKE PLACE IN SUBSEQUENT YEARS, OR THROUGH THE LIFE OF

[Captioner] 19:59:56
 THE HOUSING ELEMENT.


[Captioner] 20:00:01
SO FAR, WE'VE COVERED THE WHAT AND THE WHY.
I WANT TO TOUCH ON

[Captioner] 20:00:06
 THE WHEN.
SO THE HOUSING ELEMENT

[Captioner] 20:00:10
 INCLUDES 94 PROGRAMS.
THESE PROGRAMS WERE INFORMED BY THE GOALS, POLICIES AND

[Captioner] 20:00:14
 OBJECTIVES CONTAINED IN THE CITY'S HOUSING ELEMENT.
THE REQUIRED

[Captioner] 20:00:18
 IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE PROGRAMS IS SCHEDULED TO TAKE PLACE DURING DIFFERENT TIMES OF THE PLANNING 

[Captioner] 20:00:23
PERIOD.
AS SHOWN ON THIS SLIDE, THE BULK OF IMPLEMENTATION IS

[Captioner] 20:00:28
 EITHER ONGOING OR WITHIN 12 MONTHS OF HOUSING ELEMENT ADOPTION, WHICH

[Captioner] 20:00:32
 FOR THE CITY OF FREMONT IS JANUARY 10TH, 2024.


[Captioner] 20:00:38
THOUGH IT APPEARS THAT IMPLEMENTATION TAPERS OFF AFTER THIS

[Captioner] 20:00:42
 INITIAL 12-MONTH PERIOD, LOOKING CLOSELY AT THE ANNUAL AN OP GOING

[Captioner] 20:00:46
 ONGOING COMMITMENT SHOWS THAT IS NOT THE CASE.


[Captioner] 20:00:50
SO IN OTHER WORDS THE CITY NEEDS TO CONTINUOUSLY MONITOR ITS PROGRESS TO MATCH ITS COMMITMENTS,

[Captioner] 20:00:54
 AND UPDATE ANY LOCAL REGULATIONS TO ENSURE FREMONT WILL

[Captioner] 20:00:59
 MEET ITS

[Captioner] 20:01:03
 HOUSING ELEMENT COMMITMENTS.
SO OF THE TOTAL 94 PROGRAMS, THE CITY NEEDS

[Captioner] 20:01:08
 TO IMPLEMENT OVER A QUARTER OF THEM BY THE END OF THIS YEAR, EFFECTIVELY.


[Captioner] 20:01:13
15 OF THE 25 PROGRAMS THAT NEED TO BE

[Captioner] 20:01:18
 IMPLEMENTED INVOLVE CHANGES TO THE FREMONT MUNICIPAL CODE.
OF THOSE 15

[Captioner] 20:01:22
 PROGRAMS, 14 DEAL WITH PLANNING AND ZONING-RELATED ISSUES, AND THESE ARE

[Captioner] 20:01:26
 THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE BEFORE YOU TONIGHT.


[Captioner] 20:01:34
WHERE THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS ARE TAKING PLACE.
IN OTHER WORDS, WHERE DO THESE

[Captioner] 20:01:38
 CHANGES IMPACT THE CITY?
THIS SLIDE NOTES AND PROVIDES

[Captioner] 20:01:42
 AN ABBREVIATED DESCRIPTION OF THE 14 PROGRAMS TO BE IMPLEMENTED THROUGH THE PROPOSED TEXT AMENDMENTS.


[Captioner] 20:01:47
THE THEME THAT WEAVES THROUGH THE PROGRAMS IS NO DIFFERENT THAN THE ONE

[Captioner] 20:01:51
 THE STATE HAS BEEN PUSHING FOR THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, WHICH IS HOUSING

[Captioner] 20:01:56
 PRODUCTION.
THE BIG PICTURE IS IMPLEMENTATION

[Captioner] 20:02:00
 OF THESE PROGRAMS IS INTENDED TO COMPLY WITH STATE LAW BY, ONE, REDUCING BARRIERS TO

[Captioner] 20:02:04
 HOUSING, AND SUPPORTING THE DEVELOPMENT OF MORE AFFORDABLE

[Captioner] 20:02:09
 HOMES.
ATTACHMENT D TO THE STAFF REPORT PROVIDES A

[Captioner] 20:02:13
 DETAILED ANALYSIS OF THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS WITH RESPECT TO EACH OF THE 14

[Captioner] 20:02:17
 PROGRAMS.
HAVING SAID THAT, I DO WANT TO HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE MORE POPULAR OR 

[Captioner] 20:02:22
HEAVILY FEATURED ITEMS STARTING WITH PROGRAM 17, WHICH IS ON THE NEXT

[Captioner] 20:02:28
 SLIDE.
PROGRAM 17 REQUIRES THE CITY TO UPDATE ITS DESIGN GUIDELINES TO REMOVE ANY

[Captioner] 20:02:32
 SUBJECTIVITY TO ITS REGULATIONS INSOFAR AS THEY

[Captioner] 20:02:36
 PERTAIN TO HOUSING DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS.
TO IMPLEMENT THIS

[Captioner] 20:02:40
 PROGRAM, STAFF WENT THROUGH ALL OF THE CITY'S GUIDELINES TO IDENTIFY AND CREATE

[Captioner] 20:02:45
 A CHECKLIST OF ANY EXISTING OBJECTIVE STANDARDS.


[Captioner] 20:02:49
ANY EXISTING STANDARD THAT IS NOT ENFORCE

[Captioner] 20:02:53
 ENFORCEABLE UNDER STATE LAW

[Captioner] 20:02:58
 WAS NOT INCLUDED IN THE CHECKLIST.
SO FOR

[Captioner] 20:03:02
 EXAMPLE, RULE 273 READS, IN ADDITION TO STREET

[Captioner] 20:03:07
 TREES, YARD TREES MAY BE REQUIRED WHERE EXISTING LANDSCAPING IS LIMITED, OR WHEN

[Captioner] 20:03:11
 PRIVACY CONCERNS ARISE.
THIS RULE IS

[Captioner] 20:03:15
 NOT ENFORCEABLE UNDER STATE LAW BECAUSE IT IS NOT OBJECTIVE.
PER STATE LAW, OBJECTIVE

[Captioner] 20:03:20
 STANDARDS INVOLVE NO PERSONAL OR SUBJECTIVE JUDGMENT

[Captioner] 20:03:24
 BY PUBLIC OFFICIAL AND OBJECTIVE STANDARDS ARE UNIFORMLY

[Captioner] 20:03:30
 VERIFIABLE.
IN ADDITION TO LEAVING OUT ANY STANDARD THAT WAS NOT CLEARLY

[Captioner] 20:03:34
 OBJECTIVE, STAFF CLARIFIED ANY EXISTING RULE THAT MAY HAVE BEEN AMBIGUOUS BUT WAS

[Captioner] 20:03:39
 OBJECTIVE IN SPIRIT.
I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT

[Captioner] 20:03:43
 STAFF HAS NOT INTRODUCED NEW STANDARDS BECAUSE WE WANT TO AVOID THE POTENTIAL IMPLICATION

[Captioner] 20:03:47
 THAT THE CHANGE MAY BE VIEWED AS A MORE RESTRICTIVE REQUIREMENT IN THE EYES OF

[Captioner] 20:03:51
 THE STATE.


[Captioner] 20:03:56
THIS NEXT PROGRAM, PROGRAM 32, REQUIRES THE CITY TO ADOPT AN ORDINANCE

[Captioner] 20:04:01
 IMPLEMENTING SENATE BILL 9.
MUCH LIKE ACCESSORY DWELLING UNITS,

[Captioner] 20:04:05
 WHICH HAVE BEEN POPULAR, THIS IS A POPULAR TOPIC BECAUSE THE BILL WAS PASSED

[Captioner] 20:04:09
 TO MINIMIZE THE RESTRICTIONS AND LIMITATIONS OF TRADITIONAL

[Captioner] 20:04:14
 SINGLE-FAMILY ZONING.
THE LAW HAS TWO MAJOR COMPONENTS.


[Captioner] 20:04:18
THE RIGHT TO DEVELOP MORE THAN ONE HOME ON A SINGLE-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL LOT, AND THE

[Captioner] 20:04:22
 RIGHT TO SUBDIVIDE A SINGLE-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL LOT.


[Captioner] 20:04:26
THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS ARE MODELED AFTER STATE LEGISLATION.


[Captioner] 20:04:35
THE LAST PROGRAM I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT IS PROGRAM 91.
THIS CALLS FOR

[Captioner] 20:04:39
 VERTICAL CONSIST 10 SATISFY BETWEEN THE CITY'S GENERAL PLAN AND ZONING.


[Captioner] 20:04:43
SPECIFICALLY BETWEEN THE WARM SPRINGS/SOUTH FREMONT

[Captioner] 20:04:48
 COMMUNITY PLAN AND THE WARM SPRINGS INNOVATION DISTRICT.
AS TYPICALLY IS THE CASE, THE 

[Captioner] 20:04:53
COMMUNITY PLANS USE BROAD STROKES TO PAINT A VISION COMPRISING A VARIETY OF

[Captioner] 20:04:57
 USES THAT ARE MIXED AND MINGLED.
WHEREAS THE ZONING DISTRICT

[Captioner] 20:05:02
 USES A FINE TOOTH COMB TO DRAW ORDER AND

[Captioner] 20:05:06
 STRATEGICALLY CONFIGURE USES THAT ARE SUITABLE WITH ONE ANOTHER.
HOWEVER,

[Captioner] 20:05:11
 UNDER THE HOUSING CRISIS ACT OF 2019, THE CITY

[Captioner] 20:05:15
 MUST ALLOW HOUSING DEVELOPMENT WHERE THE GENERAL PLAN OR COMMUNITY

[Captioner] 20:05:19
 PLAN ALLOWS SUCH USES.
EVEN IF THE ZONING ORDINANCE

[Captioner] 20:05:24
 IS MORE RESTRICTIVE.
TO COMPLY WITH STATE LAW,

[Captioner] 20:05:28
 THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS UPDATE THE USE TABLE FOR THE WARM SPRINGS INNOVATION DISTRICT,

[Captioner] 20:05:33
 TO ALLOW RESIDENTIAL USES WITHIN ALL 10 PLANNING AREAS OF THE

[Captioner] 20:05:36
 COMMUNITY PLAN.
I DO WANT TO NOTE THAT THE RESIDENTIAL USES WOULD

[Captioner] 20:05:41
 STILL NEED TO DEMONSTRATE COMPLIANCE WITH OTHER PARTS AND PROVISIONS OF

[Captioner] 20:05:45
 THE GENERAL P PLAN.


[Captioner] 20:05:50
THIS BRINGS ME TO THE LAST POINT, HOW.
HOW DOES

[Captioner] 20:05:54
 IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROPOSED TEXT AMENDMENTS BENEFIT THE CITY?


[Captioner] 20:05:58
WELL, IN PRACTICE, NOTHING CHANGES.
AND WHAT I MEAN BY THIS IS THAT EVEN IF

[Captioner] 20:06:02
 THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS ARE NOT ADOPTED, THE CITY IS STILL

[Captioner] 20:06:07
 REQUIRED TO APPLY AND OPERATE UNDER STATE LAW.
BUT THERE

[Captioner] 20:06:11
 ARE BENEFITS TO ADOPTING THE

[Captioner] 20:06:15
 PROPOSED CHANGES.
FOR STARTERS, ADOPTION OF THE PROPOSED

[Captioner] 20:06:19
 AMENDMENTS WOULD FORMALIZE THE COMPLIANCE PIECE.
IT WOULD MEMORIALIZE WHAT'S ALREADY

[Captioner] 20:06:23
 BEING PRACTICED IN ACCORDANCE WITH STATE LAW.
ANOTHER BENEFIT IS THAT IT WOULD 

[Captioner] 20:06:27
PROVIDE CLARITY FOR STAFF, APPLICANTS, DECISION-MAKERS, AND THE PUBLIC AT

[Captioner] 20:06:31
 LARGE.
IT WOULD PROMOTE UNIFORMITY.


[Captioner] 20:06:35
WHEN LOCAL CODES COMPLY WITH STATE LAW, IT HELPS TO ENSURE THAT EVERYONE IS TREATED FAIRLY.


[Captioner] 20:06:40
IT WOULD AVOID LEGAL CHALLENGES.
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT FAIL TO

[Captioner] 20:06:45
 UPDATE THEIR CODES TO COMPLY WITH STATE LAW MAY FACE LEGAL CHALLENGES FROM

[Captioner] 20:06:49
 RESIDENTS OR BUSINESSES.
THESE CHALLENGES CAN BE COSTLY AND

[Captioner] 20:06:54
 TIME-CONSUMING.
ANOTHER BIG BENEFIT IS ACCESS TO STATE FUNDING.


[Captioner] 20:06:59
SOME STATE FUNDING PROGRAMS REQUIRE LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO HAVE CODES THAT COMPLY WITH STATE

[Captioner] 20:07:03
 LAW, AND FAILURE TO UPDATE LOCAL CODES COULD RESULT IN A LOSS OF

[Captioner] 20:07:07
 THAT FUNDING OPPORTUNITY.
IN CLOSING, I

[Captioner] 20:07:11
 JUST WANT TO REITERATE THAT THE IMPETUS BEHIND THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS IS COMPLIANCE WITH

[Captioner] 20:07:15
 STATE LAW.
THE 14 PROGRAMS THAT WERE

[Captioner] 20:07:19
 HIGHLIGHTED TONIGHT ARE PART OF THE CITY'S HOUSING ELEMENT AND EACH OF THOSE

[Captioner] 20:07:23
 PROGRAMS REQUIRES THE CITY TO TAKE ACTION BY UPDATING

[Captioner] 20:07:27
 THE FMC TO COMPLY WITH VARIOUS STATE LAW.


[Captioner] 20:07:32
TO THAT END, STAFF

[Captioner] 20:07:36
 RECOMMENDS THAT THE CITY COUNCIL FIND THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS ARE EXEMPT FROM

[Captioner] 20:07:40
 THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT, CONSISTENT WITH

[Captioner] 20:07:44
 THE GENERAL PLAN, AND THAT THEY FURTHER THE PUBLIC INTEREST,

[Captioner] 20:07:48
 CONVENIENCE, AND GENERAL WELFARE

[Captioner] 20:07:52
.
INTRODUCE AN ORDINANCE APPROVING THE AMENDMENTS AND

[Captioner] 20:07:57
 ADOPT A RESOLUTION IMPLEMENTING PROGRAM 17, WHICH ENTAILS REVISIONS TO THE CITY'S

[Captioner] 20:08:01
 ADOPTED DESIGN GUIDELINES TO IDENTIFY AND ESTABLISH OBJECTIVE

[Captioner] 20:08:05
 DESIGN STANDARDS.
THAT CONCLUDES MY PRESENTATION, AND I'M

[Captioner] 20:08:09
 HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:08:15
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
AT THIS TIME I'D LIKE TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY CLARIFYING QUESTIONS FROM 

[Captioner] 20:08:20
THE COUNCIL.
COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:08:28
>> Councilmember Campbell: THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION.
I JUST HAVE ONE REALLY QUICK

[Captioner] 20:08:32
 QUESTION.
YOU SAID THAT BECAUSE WE

[Captioner] 20:08:38
 ADOPTED THE HOUSING ELEMENT IN JANUARY

[Captioner] 20:08:43
 OF 2023, THAT WOULD BE THE BEGINNING OF THIS YEAR, AND YOU HAD SEVERAL PROJECTS THAT

[Captioner] 20:08:47
 WERE DUE WITHIN 12 MONTHS OF

[Captioner] 20:08:51
 THAT, IT WAS A LOT OF PROJECTS.
SO IT WAS PRETTY AMBITIOUS.
SO I'M

[Captioner] 20:08:55
 WONDERING, ARE WE WORKING ON THESE PROJECTS?
BECAUSE THAT MEANS YOU HAVE TO BE 

[Captioner] 20:09:00
FINISHED WITH THEM IN TWO MONTHS.
AND I'M JUST

[Captioner] 20:09:04
 WONDERING HOW IS THAT WORKING FOR US?
>> SURE.
SO

[Captioner] 20:09:08
 THIS IS THAT PROJECT.


[Captioner] 20:09:13
THERE ARE A SET OF PROGRAMS THAT THE CITY NEEDS TO IMPLEMENT DURING DIFFERENT

[Captioner] 20:09:18
 PHASES OF THE HOUSING ELEMENT, THE PLANNING PERIOD, WHICH

[Captioner] 20:09:22
 RUNS FROM 2023 TO 2031.
THE 14 PROGRAMS

[Captioner] 20:09:26
 THAT I REFERENCED IN MY PRESENTATION ARE THE ONES THAT THE CITY NEEDS

[Captioner] 20:09:32
 TO IMPLEMENT BEFORE JANUARY 10, 2025.
AND THE WAY

[Captioner] 20:09:37
 THE IMPLEMENTATION IS BEING CARRIED OUT --
>> Councilmember

[Captioner] 20:09:41
 Campbell: ARE YOU SAYING 2025 OR 2024?
>> 2024 IS

[Captioner] 20:09:45
 WHEN THE CITY COUNCIL ADOPTED THE HOUSING ELEMENT.
>> Councilmember Campbell: WE

[Captioner] 20:09:49
 DID THAT IN 2023.
>> I'M SORRY, 2023.
I'M SORRY.


[Captioner] 20:09:53
>> Councilmember Campbell: YOU'RE CONFUSING YOU.
>> EARLIER THIS YEAR IS WHEN THE CITY 

[Captioner] 20:09:58
COUNCIL ADOPTED THE

[Captioner] 20:10:02
 THE HOUSING ELEMENT.
WE HAVE UNTIL JANUARY 10, 2024

[Captioner] 20:10:07
 TO IMPLEMENT THESE PROGRAMS.
AND THE WAY THEY'RE BEING IMPLEMENTED IS VIA THE PROPOSED

[Captioner] 20:10:11
 TEXT AMENDMENTS.
>> Councilmember Campbell: I THOUGHT YOU ACTUALLY HAD TO BE

[Captioner] 20:10:15
 PHYSICALLY BUILDING SOMETHING OR MOVING PEOPLE INTO HOUSING.
BECAUSE

[Captioner] 20:10:20
 IT SAYS WITHIN 12 MONTHS, THE NUMBER OF PROGRAMS IS 25.
SO THAT

[Captioner] 20:10:25
 MEANS BY JANUARY OF

[Captioner] 20:10:30
 2024, YOU WOULD HAVE HAD TO COMPLEEMENT OR JUST IMPLEMENT THE 25 PROGRAMS?


[Captioner] 20:10:34
>> IMPLEMENTATION.
SO 25 IS THE FULL LIST OF PROGRAMS THAT

[Captioner] 20:10:38
 NEED TO BE IMPLEMENTED WITHIN 12 MONTHS OF ADOPTION,

[Captioner] 20:10:43
 BUT ONLY 14 ARE BEING CONSIDERED TONIGHT.


[Captioner] 20:10:47
BECAUSE THEY PERTAIN TO TEXT AMENDMENTS TO THE ZONING CODE.
THE

[Captioner] 20:10:52
 OTHER -- THE REMAINING BALANCE, THEY'RE MORE ADMINISTRATIVE.


[Captioner] 20:10:56
>> Councilmember Campbell: OKAY.
THANK YOU FOR THE CLARIFICATION.


[Captioner] 20:11:02
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
ARE THERE SPEAKER CARDS ON THIS ITEM THIS EVENING?


[Captioner] 20:11:06
>> Ms. Gauthier: NONE.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
AT THIS TIME, I'D LIKE TO SEE IF 

[Captioner] 20:11:11
THERE'S ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS OR A MOTION FROM THE COUNCIL?


[Captioner] 20:11:16
I JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY ON A COUPLE THINGS.
ONE, BEFORE WE DO

[Captioner] 20:11:20
 THAT, WE DID HAVE AN OUTREACH FOR THE HOUSING ELEMENT,

[Captioner] 20:11:24
 AND WE HAD A COMMUNITY OUTREACH, AND THAT IS IN CASE ANYBODY WANTS TO SEE THAT,

[Captioner] 20:11:29
 ATTACHED IN THE AGENDA, AS WELL AS THE FACT THAT THIS WAS ALSO RUN

[Captioner] 20:11:33
 BEFORE, AND HAS BEEN APPROVED BY OUR PLANNING COMMISSION,

[Captioner] 20:11:34
 MY UNDERSTANDING.
SO I JUST WANTED TO NOTE THOSE FOR THE PUBLIC.


[Captioner] 20:11:39
COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL, IS THIS FROM YOU?
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:11:44
>> Councilmember Campbell: I WOULD JUST LIKE TO MOVE THIS ITEM.


[Captioner] 20:11:48
>> Councilmember Keng: I WILL SECOND.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
SO IT MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL 

[Captioner] 20:11:52
AND SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER KENG.
PLEASE VOTE.


[Captioner] 20:12:03
>> Ms. Gauthier: COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL, PLEASE RE-VOTE.


[Captioner] 20:12:10
THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: THE MOTION PASSES UNANIMOUSLY.


[Captioner] 20:12:14
>> MAY I READ THE ORDINANCE INTO THE RECORD?
THE

[Captioner] 20:12:18
 ORDINANCE TITLE IS AN ORDINANCE OF THE CITY OF FREMONT AMENDING VARIOUS CHAPTERS OF THE FREMONT

[Captioner] 20:12:23
 MUNICIPAL CODE TITLED 17 SUBDIVISIONS AND TITLE

[Captioner] 20:12:27
 18, PLANNING AND ZONING, TO COMPLY WITH STATE LAW AND IMPLEMENT

[Captioner] 20:12:31
 PROGRAMS 16, 17, 18, 32, 34,

[Captioner] 20:12:35
 36, 37, 44, 45,

[Captioner] 20:12:40
 46, 69, 74,

[Captioner] 20:12:44
 76 AND 91 OF THE CITY'S 2023-2031 HOUSING ELEMENT, AND MAKING

[Captioner] 20:12:48
 FINDINGS OF CEQA EXEMPTION.
THANK YOU, MAYOR.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:12:53
AND ALSO JUST BECAUSE WE USE A LOT OF ACRONYMS, I ALSO WANT TO CLARIFY FOR

[Captioner] 20:12:57
 PEOPLE WHO MAY OR MAY NOT KNOW, FMC MEANS FREMONT

[Captioner] 20:13:03
 MUNICIPAL CODE.
WE ARE GOVERNED AS A GENERAL LAW CITY AND WE HAVE CODES WE HAVE TO UPDATE

[Captioner] 20:13:06
 IN COMPLIEBS WITH STATE LEGISLATION AND ORDINANCES.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:13:12
NEXT WE HAVE A REPORT ON

[Captioner] 20:13:16
 VEHICULAR HOMELESSNESS RESPONSE UPDATE.
AND THAT IS BEING PRESENTED BY OUR 

[Captioner] 20:13:21
DEPUTY CITY MANAGER, ALLEN DEMEARS, WHO WILL SHARE

[Captioner] 20:13:25
 A PRESENTATION ALONG WITH OUR HOMELESS SERVICES MANAGER, LAURIE FLORES.


[Captioner] 20:13:38
>> City Mgr. Shackelford: MAYOR, AS THEY'RE GETTING SET UP I JUST WANTED TO SHARE A FEW WORDS.


[Captioner] 20:13:42
>> Mayor Mei: SURE, IF YOU COULD.


[Captioner] 20:13:46
>> City Mgr. Shackelford: SO BEFORE THEY PRESENT THIS INFORMATIONAL

[Captioner] 20:13:51
 ITEM -- OH, OH.
ALL RIGHT.
IS THAT BETTER?


[Captioner] 20:13:55
ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU.
SO BEFORE THEY PRESENT

[Captioner] 20:13:59
 THIS INFORMATIONAL ITEM, I JUST WANTED TO SHARE A FEW THOUGHTS.
I KNOW THAT THERE

[Captioner] 20:14:03
 IS GREAT FRUSTRATION IN THE COMMUNITY WITH RV PARKING, AND I

[Captioner] 20:14:07
 WANT THOSE COMMUNITY MEMBERS TO

[Captioner] 20:14:11
 KNOW AND UNDERSTAND THAT WE HEAR THEM AND WE ARE GRAPPLING WITH THEIR CONCERNS AND THE

[Captioner] 20:14:16
 VARIOUS WAYS WE CAN ADDRESS THEM.
I ASKED STAFF TO PREPARE

[Captioner] 20:14:20
 THIS INFORMATIONAL ITEM FOR THE CITY COUNCIL TO HELP EDUCATE AND GROUND

[Captioner] 20:14:24
 US ALL IN OUR CURRENT PROCEDURES AND

[Captioner] 20:14:28
 THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK GUIDING THE CITY IN ADVANCE

[Captioner] 20:14:32
 OF COUNCIL ISSUING ANY NEW DIRECTION ON THE ISSUE.
IF THE COUNCIL DOES HAVE ADDITIONAL

[Captioner] 20:14:36
 DIRECTION THAT THEY WANT TO CONSIDER NOW AS OPPOSED TO

[Captioner] 20:14:41
 ADOPTING SOMETHING IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE CITY'S HOMELESS RESPONSE

[Captioner] 20:14:45
 PLAN, WHICH IS SCHEDULED FOR COMPLETION IN THE SPRING, WE STAND READY TO

[Captioner] 20:14:49
 RECEIVE THE COUNCIL'S DIRECTION.
WHILE WE CAN'T

[Captioner] 20:14:53
 ADOPT A NEW RULE TONIGHT, COUNCIL COULD, FOR EXAMPLE, DIRECT

[Captioner] 20:14:58
 STAFF TO RESEARCH AND PRESENT A PLAN TO RESTRICT LARGE

[Captioner] 20:15:02
 VEHICLES PARKING AROUND FREMONT SCHOOLS.
WE WOULD THEN RETURN

[Captioner] 20:15:06
 WITH RECOMMENDATIONS, PROCEDURES, AND COSTS ASSOCIATED

[Captioner] 20:15:11
 WITH SUCH AN ACTION FOR ADDITIONAL COUNCIL DIRECTION.


[Captioner] 20:15:16
SO IN SUMMARY, I HOPE THAT THE STAFF REPORT ON TONIGHT'S AGENDA IS

[Captioner] 20:15:20
 A HELPFUL INFORMATIONAL GUIDE TO THE COUNCIL, AS YOU ALL

[Captioner] 20:15:24
 CONSIDER ADDITIONAL ACTION.
SO I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING YOUR

[Captioner] 20:15:28
 THOUGHTS.


[Captioner] 20:15:34
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
>>

[Captioner] 20:15:39
 THANK YOU.
AS THE CITY MANAGER

[Captioner] 20:15:43
 NOTED, TONIGHT IS AN INFORMATIONAL

[Captioner] 20:15:47
 PRESENTATION.
WITH ME IS LAURIE FLORES, THE CITY'S HOMELESS

[Captioner] 20:15:51
 SERVICES MANAGER, BUT ALSO PARTNERING ON THIS PRESENTATION IS

[Captioner] 20:15:55
 RAFAEL ALVARADO, OUR CITY ATTORNEY, BECAUSE TONIGHT'S PRESENTATION AND THE

[Captioner] 20:15:59
 STAFF REPORT THAT ACCOMPANIED IT IS FOCUSED LARGELY ON

[Captioner] 20:16:03
 THE LEGAL AND REGULATORY FRAMEWORK THAT GOVERNS HOW

[Captioner] 20:16:08
 STAFF RESPONDS TO CONCERNS RELATED

[Captioner] 20:16:12
 TO VEHICULAR HOMELESSNESS.
TONIGHT'S PRESENTATION IS NOT GOING TO

[Captioner] 20:16:18
 FOCUS ON THE OUTREACH AND SUPPORTIVE SERVICES THAT GENERALLY ACCOMPANIES

[Captioner] 20:16:22
 THAT, BECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND THE INTEREST BOTH FROM THE COUNCIL AND IN

[Captioner] 20:16:26
 THE COMMUNITY TO RELATE TO REGULATION.


[Captioner] 20:16:31
HOWEVER, LAURIE AND OTHERS ARE HERE TO THE EXTENT THAT COUNCIL HAS

[Captioner] 20:16:35
 QUESTIONS REGARDING THOSE ACTIONS.


[Captioner] 20:16:39
IN THAT SAME SPIRIT, THE CITY IS

[Captioner] 20:16:44
 WORKING WITH A CONSULTANT ON A CITY-WIDE

[Captioner] 20:16:48
 HOMELESSNESS RESPONSE PLAN, AND THAT PLAN WILL BE DONE IN

[Captioner] 20:16:52
 THE SPRING.
THAT PLAN WILL FOCUS

[Captioner] 20:16:57
 PRIMARILY ON RESOLVING HOMELESSNESS AND

[Captioner] 20:17:02
 PREVENTING HOMELESSNESS, AND WILL HAVE LESS

[Captioner] 20:17:06
 FOCUS ON REGULATORY ACTIONS, ALTHOUGH IT WILL INCLUDE REGULATORY

[Captioner] 20:17:10
 ACTIONS AS PART OF ITS OVERALL APPROACH RESPONDING TO HOMELESSNESS.


[Captioner] 20:17:17
SO WITH ALL OF THAT SAID, I'D LIKE TO UNDERLINE ONE LAST THING THAT

[Captioner] 20:17:21
 KARENA MENTIONED WHICH IS THAT TONIGHT IS INTENDED TO BE INFORMATIONAL AND IS

[Captioner] 20:17:25
 INTENDED TO PROVIDE COUNCIL WITH A FRAMEWORK AND WITH SOME UNDERSTANDING

[Captioner] 20:17:31
 OF HOW STAFF IS WORKING TO ADDRESS

[Captioner] 20:17:36
 THESE COMPLAINTS AS YOU, THE COUNCIL, CONTEMPLATE POTENTIAL

[Captioner] 20:17:40
 ADDITIONAL LOCAL REGULATION.


[Captioner] 20:17:46
WE'D LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT HOMELESSNESS IN FREMONT IS A

[Captioner] 20:17:52
 GROWING ISSUE, AS IS PRESENTED IN THE

[Captioner] 20:17:56
 STATISTICS, BOTH INDIVIDUAL HOMELESSNESS AND INDIVIDUALS

[Captioner] 20:18:00
 RESIDING IN CARS AND RVs.
AND

[Captioner] 20:18:04
 THAT IS CREATING GROWING FRUSTRATION WITHIN THE COMMUNITY.
WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT.


[Captioner] 20:18:09
WE HAVE CERTAINLY HEARD FROM THOSE INDIVIDUALS.
AND

[Captioner] 20:18:13
 IT'S REFLECTIVE OF DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES

[Captioner] 20:18:17
 FOR ALL OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE ALSO LIVING ON CITY

[Captioner] 20:18:21
 OF FREMONT STREETS.


[Captioner] 20:18:28
I'M GOING TO HAND IT OFF TO CITY ATTORNEY

[Captioner] 20:18:33
 ALVARADO TO WALK THROUGH A SUMMARY OF THESE

[Captioner] 20:18:38
 CASES AND THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK THAT GUIDES THE CITY OF

[Captioner] 20:18:43
 FREMONT'S STAFF WHEN WE'RE RESPONDING TO VEHICULAR HOMELESSNESS,

[Captioner] 20:18:47
 BUT I WOULD LIKE TO NOTE

[Captioner] 20:18:51
 THAT THE ENVIRONMENT IS FLUID.
THESE THINGS ARE CHANGING IN

[Captioner] 20:18:56
 REALTIME.
THE CITY OF FREMONT'S STAFF IS DOING

[Captioner] 20:19:00
 THEIR ABSOLUTE BEST TO WORK WITHIN THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK THAT

[Captioner] 20:19:08
 EXISTS TO RESPOND TO COMMUNITY CONCERNS, TO ATTEMPT TO RESOLVE HOMELESSNESS AND

[Captioner] 20:19:12
 TO PREVENT LIABILITY FOR THE CITY OF FREMONT, AND I'D LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE HARD

[Captioner] 20:19:16
 WORK AND GOOD WORK OF ALL OF THOSE STAFF MEMBERS THAT ARE OUT IN

[Captioner] 20:19:20
 THE FIELD OPERATING IN THIS DIFFICULT LEGAL ENVIRONMENT.
SO WITH THAT, I'LL HAND IT OFF TO

[Captioner] 20:19:25
 RAFAEL.
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: THANK YOU.
AS YOU CAN SEE ON THE SLIDE, THERE'S A 

[Captioner] 20:19:30
FEW CASES THAT WE WILL BE PRESENTING, AND THE PURPOSE OF THE PRESENTATION

[Captioner] 20:19:34
 IS TO INFORM THE COUNCIL OF THE EXISTING STATE OF CASE LAW

[Captioner] 20:19:38
 WITH RESPECT TO ENFORCEMENT OF PROGRAMS ON THE UNHOUSED

[Captioner] 20:19:42
 POPULATION.
AND LARGELY WHAT WE SEE HERE IS A LINE OF NINTH CIRCUIT

[Captioner] 20:19:47
 CASES THAT HAVE SERVED TO INFORM CITIES OVER THE PAST DECADE ON LIMITS

[Captioner] 20:19:51
 TO ENFORCEMENT PROGRAMS THAT CONCERN THE UNHOUSED POPULATION.


[Captioner] 20:19:56
THE FIRST CASE THAT WE'LL DISCUSS IS LAVAN

[Captioner] 20:20:00
 VERSUS CITY OF LOS ANGELES.
IT'S A 2012 CASE THAT CONCERNS SEIZURE OF PERSONAL PROPERTY.


[Captioner] 20:20:04
IN THAT CASE, THE NINTH CIRCUIT RULED

[Captioner] 20:20:08
 THAT THE -- AND THE 14TH AMENDMENT PROTECT HOMELESS PERSONS FROM GOVERNMENT SEIZURE

[Captioner] 20:20:13
 AND SUMMARY DESTRUCTION OF THEIR ABANDONED BUT MOMENTARILY UNATTENDED

[Captioner] 20:20:18
 PERSONAL PROPERTY.
SO THE IMPACT OF THIS CASE LOCAL LEGAL IN LOS ANGELES WAS THAT

[Captioner] 20:20:22
 THE COURT IMPOSED AN INJUNCTION UPON THE CITY OF

[Captioner] 20:20:26
 LOS ANGELES FROM DESTROYING SEEDS PROPERLY, WITHOUT MAINTAINING THAT PROPERTY IN

[Captioner] 20:20:30
 A SECURE LOCATION FOR A PERIOD OF NO LESS THAN 90 DAYS.
UNLESS THERE WAS AN

[Captioner] 20:20:34
 IMMEDIATE THREAT TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH OR SAFETY.
SO FOR US THROUGHOUT THE RETION OF

[Captioner] 20:20:39
 THE STATE, THE IMPACT OF THAT CASE IS THAT CITIES MUST PROVIDE

[Captioner] 20:20:43
 UNHOUSED INDIVIDUALS A MEANINGFUL OPPORTUNITY AND AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE

[Captioner] 20:20:47
 HEARD BEFORE SEIZING AND DESTROYING PERSONAL PROPERTY IN THE PUBLIC

[Captioner] 20:20:52
 RIGHT-OF-WAY THAT IS NOT ABANDONED.
NOW, THERE ARE EXCEPTIONS TO THAT PROPOSITION,

[Captioner] 20:20:56
 AND THOSE TYPICALLY INCLUDE THREATS TO THE IMMEDIATE -- IMMEDIATE

[Captioner] 20:21:00
 THREATS TO PUBLIC SAFETY, EVIDENCE OF CRIME OR CONTRABAND.
IN

[Captioner] 20:21:03
 THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE CITY MAY IMMEDIATELY SEIZE THOSE PERSONAL ARTICLES.


[Captioner] 20:21:11
THE NEXT CASE IS ANOTHER LOS ANGELES CASE THAT OCCURRED TWO YEARS AFTER

[Captioner] 20:21:15
 THE LAVAN CASE.
IT'S

[Captioner] 20:21:19
 DESSERTTRAIN

[Captioner] 20:21:25
 VERSUS LOS ANGELES, A VEHICLE

[Captioner] 20:21:30
 HABITATION ORDINANCE.
EERT OVERNIGHT, DAY BY DAY AND

[Captioner] 20:21:33
 OTHERWISE.
THE NINTH CIRCUIT REVIEWED THIS ORDINANCE AND DECIDED THAT THE 

[Captioner] 20:21:38
ORDINANCE WAS UNCONSTITUTIONALLY VAGUE, IN VIOLATION OF THE DUE PROCESS CLAUSE OF THE 14TH

[Captioner] 20:21:43
 AMENDMENT, BECAUSE IT WAS ALSO OVERBROAD AND LACKED STANDARDS FOR

[Captioner] 20:21:47
 EXERCISING DISCRETION RESULTING IN ARBITRARY ENFORCEMENT THAT TARGETED THE

[Captioner] 20:21:51
 UNHOUSED POPULATION.
SO THE IMPACT OF THIS CASE IS THAT IT'S BASICALLY

[Captioner] 20:21:56
 GUIDANCE BY THE NINTH CIRCUIT THAT VEHICLE HABITATION ORDINANCES MUST BE

[Captioner] 20:22:00
 CLEAR, AND IT DEMONSTRATED THAT ENFORCING VEHICLE HABITATION

[Captioner] 20:22:05
 LAWS CAN

[Captioner] 20:22:09
 BE FRAUGHT WITH CIVIL LIABILITY FOR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS.


[Captioner] 20:22:14
THE NEXT, MARTIN VERSES CITY OF BOISE, I THINK THIS IS PROBABLY THE MORE

[Captioner] 20:22:19
 WELL-KNOWN RECENT CASE THAT CONCERNS SLEEPING IN THE PUBLIC RIGHT-OF-WAY.
IN MARTIN VERSUS

[Captioner] 20:22:24
 BOISE, THE CITY OF BOISE, THE NINTH CIRCUIT RULED THAT THE CRUEL

[Captioner] 20:22:28
 AND UNUSUAL PUNISHMENTS CLAUSE OF THE EIGHTH AMENDMENT PRECLUDED

[Captioner] 20:22:32
 THE ENFORCEMENT OF A STATUTE THAT PROHIBITED

[Captioner] 20:22:36
 SLEEPING OUTSIDE AGAINST HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS WITH NO ACCESS TO ALTERNATIVE SHELTER.


[Captioner] 20:22:40
SO IT HELD THAT AS LONG AS THERE'S NO OPTION OF SLEEPING INDOORS, THE GOVERNMENT

[Captioner] 20:22:45
 CANNOT CRIMINALIZE HOMELESS PEOPLE FOR SLEEPING OUTDOORS ON PUBLIC PROPERTY.


[Captioner] 20:22:50
THIS CASE HAS IMPACTED ALL OF THE STATES WITHIN

[Captioner] 20:22:54
 THE NINTH CIRCUIT.
IT IS THE STATE OF THE LAW TODAY,

[Captioner] 20:22:58
 AND IS LARGELY IN LINE WITH THE NINTH CIRCUIT'S

[Captioner] 20:23:03
 RULINGS LIMITING LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ON ENFORCEMENT PROGRAMS.
NOW

[Captioner] 20:23:09
 THERE ARE

[Captioner] 20:23:13
 IMPACTS THAT ALSO ARE ADDRESSED IN THE NEXT CASE, JOHNSON VERSUS GRANTS

[Captioner] 20:23:17
 PASS.
NOW THIS CASE IS A CASE THAT

[Captioner] 20:23:22
 FOLLOWED THE CITY OF BOISE CASE WHERE A JURISDICTION, RATHER

[Captioner] 20:23:26
 THAN ADOPTING AN ORDINANCE INTENDED TO PREVENT SLEEPING, INDICATED

[Captioner] 20:23:30
 THAT THEY WERE SIMPLY ADOPTING AN ORDINANCE THAT PREVENTED INDIVIDUALS FROM USING

[Captioner] 20:23:35
 BEDDING MATERIALS WHILE ON PUBLIC PROPERTY.
AND THE NINTH CIRCUIT RULED THAT'S 

[Captioner] 20:23:40
EFFECTIVELY AN END AROUND THE CITY OF BOISE CASE AND RULED THAT THE CITY OF GRANTS

[Captioner] 20:23:43
 PASS HAD VIOLATED THE NINTH CIRCUIT'S PRIOR

[Captioner] 20:23:48
 RULINGS.
SO THAT IS THE STATE OF NINTH CIRCUIT

[Captioner] 20:23:52
 RULINGS, REGARDING ENFORCEMENT OF UNHOUSED POPULATIONS.


[Captioner] 20:23:56
THAT DOESN'T CHANGE OUR LOCAL VEHICLE CODE

[Captioner] 20:24:00
 AUTHORITY TO ABATE VEHICLES WITHIN PUBLIC

[Captioner] 20:24:05
 RIGHTS-OF-WAYS, SO THAT'S A SEPARATE AREA OF LAW, I WANT TO PUT THAT IN A

[Captioner] 20:24:09
 SEPARATE BUCKET, WHICH IS WHY WE INCLUDED IT AS A BULLET POINT.
THE CALIFORNIA VEHICLE CODE AUTHORIZES

[Captioner] 20:24:13
 CITIES TO TOW

[Captioner] 20:24:17
 VEHICLES ON PUBLIC LAND, THIS COULD INCLUDE ONE OF THE MORE COMMON WAYS

[Captioner] 20:24:21
 THAT CITIES ENFORCE VEHICLES ON PUBLIC RIGHT-OF-WAY, WHICH IS

[Captioner] 20:24:26
 THE 72 HOUR RULE.
A LOT OF LOCAL JURISDICTIONS REQUIRE INDIVIDUALS

[Captioner] 20:24:30
 TO MOVE THEIR VEHICLES EVERY ZOO OFTEN OR POTENTIALLY

[Captioner] 20:24:34
 BE SUBJECTED TO TOWING.
THE

[Captioner] 20:24:38
 FREMONT MUNICIPAL CODE HAS A LOCAL VERSION OF THAT CALIFORNIA VEHICLE CODE

[Captioner] 20:24:43
 REQUIREMENT, AND AUTHORIZES THE REMOVAL OF VEHICLED PARKED ON

[Captioner] 20:24:47
 ANY STREET FOR MORE THAN A CONSECUTIVE PERIOD OF 72 HOURS.
THE NINTH CIRCUIT

[Captioner] 20:24:51
 CASES DO NOT DEAL WITH THE VEHICLE CODE SPECIFICALLY.


[Captioner] 20:24:58
AND CITIES HAVE MORE CERTAINTY IN TERMS OF OUTCOMES WHEN THEY ADOPT THE VEHICLE

[Captioner] 20:25:02
 CODE PROVISIONS THAT RESTRICT PARKING AS OPPOSED TO

[Captioner] 20:25:06
 THOSE THAT LEAD TO VEHICLE HABITATION.
THE LAST CASE ON THIS

[Captioner] 20:25:10
 SLIDE IS A CASE THAT DOESN'T HAVE TO TO DO WITH UNHOUSED POPULATIONS

[Captioner] 20:25:15
 BUT IT DOES THAT FOR THE PROPOSITION, THE

[Captioner] 20:25:19
 KENNEDY VERSUS RIDGEFIELD CASE THAT GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS CAN BE HELD

[Captioner] 20:25:24
 LIABLE, PLACING AN INDIVIDUAL IN A DANGEROUS SITUATION THAT THEY WOULD NOT HAVE OTHERWISED

[Captioner] 20:25:29
 FACED.
MOTH CASES THAT DEAL WITH WHAT THEY CALL THE STATE-CREATED

[Captioner] 20:25:33
 DANGER DOCTRINE ARE POLICE CASES, THEY DON'T REALLY DEAL WITH THE UNHOUSED

[Captioner] 20:25:37
 POPULATION.
BUT IT IS IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT IF A CITY

[Captioner] 20:25:43
 ACTOR ENGAGES A MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC WITH DELIBERATE INDIFFERENCE AND

[Captioner] 20:25:47
 PLACES THEM IN A DANGEROUS SITUATION THAT THEY WOULD NOT HAVE OTHERWISE

[Captioner] 20:25:51
 FACE, THEY COULD BE SUBJECTED TO CIVIL LIABILITY.
SO CITY STAFF IS MINDFUL OF THAT

[Captioner] 20:25:55
 ISSUE WHEN IT'S DEVELOPING ENFORCEMENT PROGRAMS.
SO THOSE

[Captioner] 20:25:59
 ARE -- THAT'S THE FRAMEWORK FOR TONIGHT'S DISCUSSION, AND IT SHOULD BE THE FRAMEWORK

[Captioner] 20:26:04
 FOR HOW COUNCIL CONTEMPLATES WHAT IT WANTS TO DO MOVING FORWARD.
SO

[Captioner] 20:26:08
 WITH THAT, I'LL TURN IT BACK OVER

[Captioner] 20:26:12
 TO DEPUTY

[Captioner] 20:26:17
 CITY MANAGER DEMERS.
>> NEXT I'M GOING

[Captioner] 20:26:21
 TO PITCH IT OVER TO HOMELESS SERVICES MANAGER LAURIE FLORES TO DISCUSS HOW THE CITY

[Captioner] 20:26:26
 PRIORITIZES ITS INTERVENTION

[Captioner] 20:26:29
 WHEN STAFF IS RESPONDING TO AN INSTANCE

[Captioner] 20:26:35
 OF VEHICULAR HOMELESSNESS.
AND I JUST DO WANT TO

[Captioner] 20:26:40
 NOTE THAT STAFF PRIORITIZES THEIR

[Captioner] 20:26:44
 WORK IN RESPONSE TO IN PART THE LAW AND IN PART

[Captioner] 20:26:49
 THE SEVERITY OF THE CONDITION THAT THEY'RE OBSERVING AND THE SEVERITY OF ITS IMPACT ON THE

[Captioner] 20:26:53
 COMMUNITY.
SO LAURIE HAS DONE SOME MORNING IN

[Captioner] 20:26:57
 THIS FIELD AND

[Captioner] 20:27:01
 IS GOING TO SHARE WITH YOU

[Captioner] 20:27:05
 THESE ENCAMPMENT MANAGEMENT GUIDELINES.
>> THANK YOU, MAYOR AND

[Captioner] 20:27:10
 COUNCILMEMBERS.
STAFF REPORTS OR CONCERNS RELATING TO ENCAMPMENTS

[Captioner] 20:27:14
 INCLUDING RVs

[Captioner] 20:27:20
 WITHIN -- AVAILABILITY OF RESOURCE.


[Captioner] 20:27:24
WHETHER THEY'RE HOUSING UNITS, SHELTER BEDS OR OTHER DEFINED LOCATIONS.


[Captioner] 20:27:29
STAFF ALSO MUST BALANCE THE AVAILABILITY OF CONTRACTOR TIME AND

[Captioner] 20:27:34
 EQUIPMENT AS WELL AS ADDITIONAL STAFF TO ASSIST WITH ASSESSMENT, EVALUATION

[Captioner] 20:27:38
 OR ANY INTERVENTIONS NEEDED AT A GIVEN SITE.
FOR THE SCOPE

[Captioner] 20:27:43
 OF RESPONSIBILITY AS THE CITY YIELDS FLEXIBILITIES,

[Captioner] 20:27:47
 HOW STAFF PROVIDE AND PRIORITIZE AREAS IMPACTED BY ENCAMPMENTS.


[Captioner] 20:27:51
OUR INTENTION IS TO LEAD WITH SERVICES AND OUTREACH THROUGH OUR HUMAN SERVICES

[Captioner] 20:27:57
 DEPARTMENT, MET UNIT AND PARTNER AGENCIES WITH THE GOAL OF RESOLVING

[Captioner] 20:28:00
 ONE'S STATUS BASED ON WHAT IS AVAILABLE.
HOWEVER, THIS IS NOT OFTEN THE CASE.


[Captioner] 20:28:05
SO STAFF EDUCATE PEOPLE ON SERVICES, PROGRAMS, AS WELL

[Captioner] 20:28:10
 AS ENCAL

[Captioner] 20:28:14
 ENCAMPMENT

[Captioner] 20:28:19
 GUIDELINES.
SOME EXAMPLES OF INTERVENTIONS INCLUDE DEBRIS

[Captioner] 20:28:23
 CLEAN-UP, MAYBE IT'S ONE TIME, MAYBE IT'S ON A ROUTINE BASIS,

[Captioner] 20:28:27
 VEGETATION MANAGEMENT, DEPLOYMENT OF SANITATION MATERIALS, AND AT TIMES

[Captioner] 20:28:32
 TOWING VEHICLES.
THIS SPECIFICALLY IS VIEWED AS A LAST RESORT WHEN NO OTHER

[Captioner] 20:28:36
 HEALTH OR SAFETY HAZARDS ARE PRESENT.
STAFF EVALUATE REPORTS THOUGHTFULLY,

[Captioner] 20:28:40
 ESPECIALLY NOW AS WE ENTER THE WINTER MONTHS.
I DO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT

[Captioner] 20:28:44
 WHEN CRIMINAL ACTIVITY IS REPORTED, WE DIRECT THESE TO THE POLICE DEPARTMENT

[Captioner] 20:28:48
 TO INVESTIGATE APPROPRIATELY.
AT TIMES THERE MAY BE OVERLAP, BUT WE DO NOT ASSUME THOSE

[Captioner] 20:28:52
 LIVING IN RVs OR ENCAMPMENTS ARE CRIMINALS.


[Captioner] 20:28:58
THE ENCAMPMENT STRATEGY WHICH DEVELOPED IN PRACTICE

[Captioner] 20:29:03
 DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC IS CENTERED AROUND

[Captioner] 20:29:07
 MITIGATING OR RESOLVING PRESENT HEALTH AND SAFETY

[Captioner] 20:29:13
 HAZARDS.
THE REMAINING POINTS LISTED ARE

[Captioner] 20:29:17
 A LIST OF IMMINENT HAZARDS, ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT IMPEDE ACCESS OR

[Captioner] 20:29:21
 FLOW OF TRAFFIC AND REQUIRE RAPID INTERVENTION.
SO IT'S SPECIFIC

[Captioner] 20:29:26
 TOLL RVs.
THEY IMPAIR VEHICLE, BIKE OR

[Captioner] 20:29:30
 PEDESTRIAN TRAFFIC, THEY IMPAIR BUS

[Captioner] 20:29:34
 STOPS, THOSE NEEDED WITH DISABILITIES OR

[Captioner] 20:29:39
 ANYBODY.
THEY IMPAIR EMERGENCY INGRESS AND EE GRETION TO ROUTES, THEY

[Captioner] 20:29:43
 IMPAIR DRIVEWAY ACCESS AND ARE PRESENT IN LOCATIONS WITH EXISTING PARKING RESTRICTIONS.


[Captioner] 20:29:50
SO THIS LIST -- THESE ARE ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS BUT NOT EXHAUSTIVE OF ALL THE

[Captioner] 20:29:55
 FACTORS EVALUATED WHEN FOLLOWING UP ON REPORTS.
IN MANY

[Captioner] 20:30:00
 CASES, STAFF ARE MET WITH VOLUNTARY COMPLIANCE.


[Captioner] 20:30:04
OTHERWISE STAFF -- THROUGH MAINTAINING INFRASTRUCTURE,

[Captioner] 20:30:09
 PREVENTING ACCESS TO CERTAIN AREAS OR CLOSING A SITE THROUGH ABATEMENT OF DEBRIS AND PROPERTY.


[Captioner] 20:30:13
AND IF IT COMES TO AN

[Captioner] 20:30:17
 ENCAMPMENT ENCLOSURE, COMPLETE CLOSURE OF THE SITE, WE ARE REQUIRED TO DEVELOP A RELOCATION PLAN

[Captioner] 20:30:22
 WE EARLIER DISCUSSED SUCH AS THE VALLEJO MILLS PLAN.
AGAIN, ANY

[Captioner] 20:30:25
 VIOLATION THAT IS A CRIMINAL OFFENSE IS MANAGED BY THE POLICE DEPARTMENT WITH THE INDIVIDUALS RESPONSIBLE.


[Captioner] 20:30:31
AGAIN THIS IS NOT AN EXHAUSTIVE LIST.
WE ALSO LOOK AT AGAIN

[Captioner] 20:30:36
 DEBRIS ACCUMULATION, FIRE HAZARD CONCERNS, I DON'T BELIEVE THAT'S

[Captioner] 20:30:40
 LISTED HERE, BECAUSE THOSE OFTEN COME UP AND THERE'S A LOT OF CONCERNS AROUND FIRE, SO

[Captioner] 20:30:44
 WE OFTEN LOOK FOR EXISTENCE OF

[Captioner] 20:30:49
 FIRE HAZARDS, HISTORY OF FIRE AND WE RESPOND APPROPRIATELY.
I DO THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO

[Captioner] 20:30:53
 PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF OUR CURRENT

[Captioner] 20:30:57
 ENCAMPMENT RESPONSE PROCESS AND I REMAIN AVAILABLE TO PROVIDE FURTHER INFORMATION AS NEEDED.


[Captioner] 20:31:04
>> Mayor Mei: SO AT THIS TIME, I'LL TURN IT OVER TO THE COUNCIL FOR CLARIFYING

[Captioner] 20:31:08
 QUESTIONS.
I WILL NOTE THAT WE'RE DUE SOON FOR A BREAK, SO I DON'T KNOW IF WE HAVE

[Captioner] 20:31:12
 SPEAKERS ON THAT, BUT I'LL DO THE CLARIFYING QUESTIONS FROM THE COUNCIL BEFORE WE TAKE A BREAK.


[Captioner] 20:31:18
UNLESS --
>> MAYOR MEI, I'VE GOT JUST ONE MORE SLIDE IF I

[Captioner] 20:31:23
 COULD, I'LL PUT A CAP ON THIS.
>> Mayor Mei: MY APOLOGIES.
>>

[Captioner] 20:31:27
, SURE.
>> I DO WANT

[Captioner] 20:31:32
 TO ACKNOWLEDGE NONE OF THE INFORMATION THAT WE PRESENTED TONIGHT IS INTENDED TO IMPLY THAT

[Captioner] 20:31:37
 THERE IS NOT MORE THAT CAN BE DONE,

[Captioner] 20:31:41
 EITHER FROM AN OUTREACH AND RESOLUTION STANDPOINT, AS I

[Captioner] 20:31:46
 KNOW LAURIE IS PASSIONATE TO PURSUE, OR FROM A LOCAL

[Captioner] 20:31:50
 REGULATORY STANDPOINT, IF THIS COUNCIL

[Captioner] 20:31:55
 IS DESIROUS OF IMPLEMENTING ADDITIONAL

[Captioner] 20:32:00
 LOCAL REGULATION, WE STAND READY TO RECEIVE THAT DIRECTION, EITHER NOW

[Captioner] 20:32:04
 OR WHEN THE CITY'S COMPREHENSIVE

[Captioner] 20:32:08
 HOMELESSNESS RESPONSE PLAN IS COMPLETE.
WE DO WANT TO

[Captioner] 20:32:12
 EMPHASIZE THAT WHETHER WE RECEIVE THAT DIRECTION NOW OR IN THE

[Captioner] 20:32:16
 FUTURE, WE WILL RETURN WITH STAFF RECOMMENDATIONS

[Captioner] 20:32:21
 THAT ARE MODELED AFTER THE SUCCESSFUL LOCAL ORDINANCES

[Captioner] 20:32:25
 THAT OTHER CITIES HAVE PURSUED, WHICH IS TO SAY THAT THEY'RE GOING TO

[Captioner] 20:32:29
 BE CLEARLY DEFINED AND SIMPLE IN CONSTRUCTION, THAT THEY'RE

[Captioner] 20:32:33
 CONSISTENTLY ENFORCEABLE, AND THAT THEY'RE NOT ARBITRARILY TARGETED AT

[Captioner] 20:32:38
 THE UNHOUSED TO THE EXCLUSION OF ALL OF THE OTHER

[Captioner] 20:32:42
 RESIDENTS OF THE CITY.
AND SO WITH THAT, WE'RE

[Captioner] 20:32:46
 HAPPY, ANY OF US, TO

[Captioner] 20:32:53
>> Mayor Mei:   SURE, WE'LL 
BEGIN WITH

[Captioner] 20:32:57
 CLARIFYING QUESTIONS 
FROM COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN.


[Captioner] 20:33:02
>> Councilmember Kassan:   SURE.

[Captioner] 20:33:06

I'D LIKE AN UPDATE ON THE VIC 
LAR HOMELESSNESS PLAN

[Captioner] 20:33:09
 THAT WAS 
PRESENTED TO US BACK IN FEBRUARY 
OF 2021.


[Captioner] 20:33:13
WHAT IS HATCHING OR SORRY, SAFE 
PARKING PLAN IS WHAT I MEANT TO 
SAY.


[Captioner] 20:33:17
WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH THE SAFER 
PARKING PROGRAM?
IS

[Captioner] 20:33:22
 IT FULL?
IS THERE MORE DMARND THAN SUPPLY

[Captioner] 20:33:24

SUPPLY?
IS THERE ANY PROGRESS ON 


[Captioner] 20:33:28
IMPLEMENTING THE SECOND

[Captioner] 20:33:31
 TWO 
PRONGS THAT WERE PRESENTED WITH 
THAT?


[Captioner] 20:33:35
BECAUSE I THINK, YOU KNOW, IF WE 
HAD A PLACE TO PEOPLE TO PARK

[Captioner] 20:33:40
 FOR PEOPLE TO PARK 
THIS MIGHT NOT BE AS BIG OF

[Captioner] 20:33:43
 AN 
ISSUE.
>> I'LL LET LAURIE OR THANK YOU 


[Captioner] 20:33:48
SUZANNE WILL ADDRESS THE CURRENT 
STATE OF THE PROGRAM AND THEN 
I'LL FOLLOW UP

[Captioner] 20:33:52
 WITH A LITTLE BIT 
OF THE FUTURE.
>> Suzanne Shenfil:   OUR

[Captioner] 20:33:57
 
CURRENT SAFE PARKING PROGRAM NOW 
DOES NOT TAKE RV'S IT

[Captioner] 20:34:02
 TAKES 
AUTOMOBILES AND ADVANCE.
IT IS

[Captioner] 20:34:08
 FULLY SUBSCRIBED AT 20 
VEHICLES,

[Captioner] 20:34:12
 15 
VEHICLES.
WE CAN GO UP TO

[Captioner] 20:34:17
 20 VEHICLES FOR 
THE FIRST TIME WE NOW HAVE A

[Captioner] 20:34:22
 
WAITING LIST OF SEVEN HOUSEHOLDS 
THAT ARE WAITING TO

[Captioner] 20:34:26
 JOIN THAT  
PROGRAM.
SO IT SEEMS TO BE WELL

[Captioner] 20:34:29
 UTILIZED 
AT THE MOMENT.
IT TOOK A LITTLE WHILE TO GET IT 


[Captioner] 20:34:33
STARTED BUT I THINK PEOPLE ARE 
AWARE OF IT NOW AND THE CHURCHES 
HAVE BEEN

[Captioner] 20:34:37
 VERY SUPPORTIVE.


[Captioner] 20:34:44
>> Councilmember Kassan:   SO 
GIVEN THAT IT'S FULLY SUBSCRIBED 
AROUND

[Captioner] 20:34:48
 THERE WAS A WAITING LIST, 
THERE WERE THREE PRONGS 
PRESENTED TO US BACK IN 20

[Captioner] 20:34:52
21.
I KNOW THAT THE MAJORITY OF THE 
COUNCIL DID NOT

[Captioner] 20:34:56
 NECESSARILY WANT 
TO PURSUE THE SECOND AND THIRD 
PRONG BUT HAS THERE BEEN

[Captioner] 20:35:00
 ANY 
PROGRESS BY STAFF ON LOOKING 
INTO THE SECOND TWO PRONGS WHICH 


[Captioner] 20:35:04
WERE PROVIDING SANCTIONED 
PARKING AREAS AND PROVIDING A

[Captioner] 20:35:08
 
CITY-HOSTED SAFE PARKING 
LOCATION

[Captioner] 20:35:13
?
>> THE COMPREHENSIVE HOME

[Captioner] 20:35:17

HOMELESSNESS RESPONSE PLAN WILL 
ADDRESS ONE OF THE

[Captioner] 20:35:21
 PRIMARY 
THINGS THAT IT'S WORKING TO 
REVIEW, IS

[Captioner] 20:35:25
 VEHICULAR 
HOMELESSNESS AND IT WILL

[Captioner] 20:35:30
 REVIEW 
THE OPTION FOR ADDITIONAL SAFE 
PARK

[Captioner] 20:35:35
ING.
I WOULD NOTE IT WILL PRESENT THE 
CITY COUNCIL

[Captioner] 20:35:40
 WITH SOME TRADEOFFS 
IN THAT RVS AND RV

[Captioner] 20:35:44
 SAFE PARKING 
IN PARTICULAR IS SUBSTANTIALLY 
MORE EXPENSIVE

[Captioner] 20:35:49
 THAN OVERNIGHT 
PARKING FOR NONRVS JUST BECAUSE

[Captioner] 20:35:53
 
OF THE ADDITIONAL SERVICES THAT 
ARE NECESSARY TO SUPPORT

[Captioner] 20:35:58
 AN RV.
SO WHEN WE RETURN IN APRIL I

[Captioner] 20:36:02
 
EXPECT THAT THERE WILL BE SOME

[Captioner] 20:36:06
 
DESCRIPTION AND EXPENSE 
ESTIMATES REMITTED TO WHAT

[Captioner] 20:36:09
 A 
SAFE PARKING RV SITE WOULD LOOK 
LIKE.


[Captioner] 20:36:14
THE OTHER THING I WOULD NOTE IS 
THAT JUST IN THE

[Captioner] 20:36:18
 OPENING SLIDE I 
WANT TO SAY IT WAS I THINK WE 
HAD SOMETHING LIKE 2

[Captioner] 20:36:23
40 RVS IN 
THE CITY.
SO WHILE THE COUNCIL

[Captioner] 20:36:27
 MAY SEEK TO 
PURSUE A SAFE RV PARKING SITE, 
THAT

[Captioner] 20:36:32
 WILL LIKELY NOT BE A

[Captioner] 20:36:38
 
PANACEA WITHIN THE PARKING

[Captioner] 20:36:41
 OF 
CITY OF FREMONT.
>> Councilmember Kassan:   I 


[Captioner] 20:36:45
THINK YOU'RE NOT ADDRESSING THE 
SECOND PRONG, THE TOTAL COST WAS 
STATE

[Captioner] 20:36:50
ED TO BE ABOUT $17,000.
SO IT'S SURPRISING TO ME THAT, 
YOU KNOW, IT'S BEEN

[Captioner] 20:36:54
 OVER THREE 
YEARS SINCE WE FIRST STARTED.
I KNOW WE'RE IN COMMENTS,

[Captioner] 20:36:57
 IN 
QUESTIONS BUT IT CONCERNS ME 
THAT WE'RE STILL JUST TALKING 


[Captioner] 20:37:02
ABOUT THIS FOR THREE YEARS AND 
NOW IT'S BECOME AT CRISIS LEVEL.

[Captioner] 20:37:06

SO ARE YOU SAYING THAT BECAUSE

[Captioner] 20:37:10
 
THE MAJORITY OF THE COUNCIL 
VOTED THOUGHT TO PURSUE PRONGS 2 


[Captioner] 20:37:14
AND 3 THAT IT HAS JUST BEEN 
COMPLETELY DROPPED FROM 
CONSIDERATION OTHER THAN

[Captioner] 20:37:18
 THIS 
UPCOMING PLAN WHICH OBVIOUSLY IS 
GOING TO TAKE TIME

[Captioner] 20:37:23
?
>> I'M SORRY, COUNCILMEMBER, I 
DON'T HAVE THE

[Captioner] 20:37:26
 HISTORY DATING 
BACK THAT FAR.
I CAN SPEAK TO THE FACT THAT IT 


[Captioner] 20:37:31
IS ON THE CITY'S RADAR AND IT 
WILL BE BEFORE COUNCIL

[Captioner] 20:37:35
 AGAIN AT 
LEAST IN THE FORM OF

[Captioner] 20:37:40
 INCLUSION 
IN A POTENTIAL PLAN FOR COUNCIL 
CONSIDERATION

[Captioner] 20:37:44
.
IT WILL LIKELY NOT INITIALLY BE 
AN

[Captioner] 20:37:48
 EXTREMELY DETAILED PROPOSAL.
IT WILL BE A GENERAL IDEA AND 
COUNCIL WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY

[Captioner] 20:37:51
 
TO DIRECT STAFF TO PURSUE IT OR 
NOT.


[Captioner] 20:37:57
>> Councilmember Kassan:   OKAY, 
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:38:03
>> Mayor Mei:   ARE THERE ANY 
OTHER CLARIFYING QUESTIONS FROM 
THE COUNCIL?


[Captioner] 20:38:07
IF NOT AT THIS TIME WE'LL TAKE A 
BREAK AND I UNDERSTAND THAT 
THERE IS ALSO

[Captioner] 20:38:11
 SEVERAL -- SORRY 
COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL JUST CAME 
UP.


[Captioner] 20:38:16
>> Councilmember Campbell:   
ACTUALLY I WAS -- MY QUESTION 
WAS SIMILAR

[Captioner] 20:38:21
 TO COUNCILMEMBER 
KASSAN'S ABOUT A CITY SANCTIONED

[Captioner] 20:38:25
 
PARKING SPACE, FACILITY

[Captioner] 20:38:29
 FOR 
UNSHELTERED COMMUNITY.
AND I RECOGNIZE

[Captioner] 20:38:33
 THAT THERE WILL 
BE SOME ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES

[Captioner] 20:38:38
 
WITH RV, ESPECIALLY WITH THE 
GRAY MATTER AND THE DUMPING

[Captioner] 20:38:43
 AND 
THAT BEING -- AND IN THEY'RE 
NONOP

[Captioner] 20:38:46
 IT WOULD BE EVEN MORE 
CHALLENGING FOR US TO BE ABLE TO 
CONSIDER THAT.


[Captioner] 20:38:51
SO I GUESS MY QUESTION WOULD BE, 
ARE WE GOING TO BE LOOKING

[Captioner] 20:38:56
 AT 
VEHICLES SEPARATELY?
SO YOU HAVE YOUR

[Captioner] 20:39:01
 REGULAR CARS, 
WHICH CAN ALSO BE ABANDONED AND

[Captioner] 20:39:04
 
NONOP.
THEN YOU HAVE VANS WHICH ARE 


[Captioner] 20:39:08
SLIGHTLY BIGGER AND THEN YOU 
HAVE YOUR RVs SO I

[Captioner] 20:39:12
 THINK WE 
NEED TO LOOK AT EACH OF THEM 
SEPARATELY BECAUSE THEY EACH 


[Captioner] 20:39:15
COME WITH A DIFFERENT SET OF 
CHALLENGES.
AND IS THAT SOMETHING THAT 


[Captioner] 20:39:19
YOU'RE LOOKING AT IN TERMS OF 
VEHICULAR

[Captioner] 20:39:25
?
>> AT THIS TIME, I'M

[Captioner] 20:39:29
 NOT SURE 
HOW GRANULARLY THE CONSULTANT

[Captioner] 20:39:33
 IS 
GOING TO BE REVIEWING DIFFERENT 
TYPES

[Captioner] 20:39:40
 OF VEHICLES BEING USED

[Captioner] 20:39:44
 AS 
RESIDENCES, FOR DWELLING.
HOWEVER, IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING

[Captioner] 20:39:48
 
THAT THEY ARE WATCHING TONIGHT'S 
COUNCIL MEETING,

[Captioner] 20:39:51
 AND THEY'RE 
LIKELY HEARING THE SOUND OF OUR 
VOICES.


[Captioner] 20:40:00
>> Mayor Mei:   IS THAT THE ONLY 
CLARIFYING QUESTION FROM YOU 
COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL

[Captioner] 20:40:04
?
OKAY THANK YOU.
I WANTED TO NOTE WE'RE GOING TO 


[Captioner] 20:40:08
TAKE A TEN MINUTE BREAK BUT 
BEFORE WE TAKE A BREAK, I WANTED

[Captioner] 20:40:12
 
TO MENTION WE WILL HAVE AN 
UPDATE TO THE PIT

[Captioner] 20:40:17
 COUNT, AND THE 
PIT COUNT IS IS THE POINT IN 
TIME

[Captioner] 20:40:22
 COUNT.
IT STARTS AT ABOUT 5 OR 6

[Captioner] 20:40:26
 OWE 
CLORK IN THE MORNING, IF YOU ARE 
INTERESTED IN JOINING IT HELPS

[Captioner] 20:40:30
 
US GET A MORE ACCURATE 
UNDERSTANDING AS TO THE

[Captioner] 20:40:33
 
PERSPECTIVE AND LOCATIONS AS 
WELL AS THE ACCURACY FOR THIS.


[Captioner] 20:40:37
AND I KNOW THAT OUR HOMELESSNESS

[Captioner] 20:40:41
 
CHAIR COORDINATOR WILL BE ALSO 
PUBLICIZING THAT.


[Captioner] 20:40:46
AND THIS WILL BE NOT JUST OUR 
DECISION AS TO THE DAIT IT WILL 
BE ONE THAT

[Captioner] 20:40:49
 IS SET BY ALAMEDA 
COUNTY FOR ALL THE CITIES TO DO 
AT THE SAME TIME.


[Captioner] 20:40:53
WITH THAT I'M GOING TO CALL A 
TEN MINUTE BREAK BECAUSE WE NEED 
A BREAK

[Captioner] 20:40:57
 FOR OUR STENO CAPTIONER 
AND WE WILL RETURN AT THAT TIME, 
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:41:01
SO SEE YOU IN TEN MINUTES.
[ 

[Captioner] 20:41:05
RECESS ]

[Captioner] 20:53:13

>> Mayor Mei:   WE WILL BEGIN 
WITH OUR PUBLIC SPEAKERS AT THIS 


[Captioner] 20:53:17
TIME.
AND THIS AGAIN WE'RE RETURNING 
CURRENTLY

[Captioner] 20:53:21
 TO ITEM 6A AS IN APPLE 
FOR VEHICULAR

[Captioner] 20:53:25
 HOMELESSNESS 
RESPONSE UPDATE.
AND I BLEACH WE HAVE SEVERAL

[Captioner] 20:53:29
 
SPEAKERS ON THIS ITEM.
>> The Clerk:   WE HAVE 11, TEN 


[Captioner] 20:53:34
CARDS.
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.
MAY WE CALL THE SPEAKERS,

[Captioner] 20:53:36
 TWO 
MINUTES EACH.
>> The Clerk:   TWO MINUTES, 


[Captioner] 20:53:41
OKAY.
THE CARD COUNT STACKING UP.


[Captioner] 20:53:45
OVER MY SHOULDER.
FIRST

[Captioner] 20:53:49
 SPEAKER IS BARATH SHRI

[Captioner] 20:53:54

SHRINIVASI FOLLOWED BY

[Captioner] 20:53:58
 MARIE 
HUGHES..


[Captioner] 20:54:07
>> ALL RIGHT, THIS IS BARATH 
HERE.


[Captioner] 20:54:12
I'M HERE TO TALK A LITTLE BIT 
ABOUT THE COMMUNITY

[Captioner] 20:54:15
 SITUATION, I 
LIVE IN THE IRVINGTON COMMUNITY 
CENTER.


[Captioner] 20:54:19
I DO HAVE NEW FRIENDS I MET HERE 
AND ALSO SOME WHO I

[Captioner] 20:54:23
 KNOW, I'M 
HERE TO TALK ABOUT THE 6A, THE 
HOME

[Captioner] 20:54:27
LESS SITUATION.
NEAR THE CHAPEL

[Captioner] 20:54:33
 BASE, THE WHOLE 
IRVINGTON AVENUE NEIGHBORHOOD

[Captioner] 20:54:38
.
I HAVE A FEW THINGS AT THE 
SCHOOLS GOING ON THE SITUATION 


[Captioner] 20:54:42
IS GETTING MORE CONCERNING.
DAY-TO-DAY

[Captioner] 20:54:46
, IT IS GETTING DARKER 
AND THE STREET LIGHTS ARE

[Captioner] 20:54:49
 NOT 
SUFFICIENT.
AND ALSO THE SCHOOLS GOES DARK 


[Captioner] 20:54:53
LIKE ON I BELIEVE SATURDAYS AND 
SUNDAYS.
THERE IS NO LIGHTS IN THE SCHOOL 


[Captioner] 20:54:57
AS WELL.
ON TOP OF IT I

[Captioner] 20:55:01
 SEE SOME UNWANTED 
ACTIVITIES IN THE SCHOOL WHICH I 
GET TO WALK AROUND

[Captioner] 20:55:05
 THE 
NEIGHBORHOOD AND I FITNESS 
MYSELF.


[Captioner] 20:55:10
FOR THE CITY'S KNOWLEDGE

[Captioner] 20:55:14
 THERE 
IS WHAT'S UP OUR GROUP AND 
COMMUNITY GOING ON AND MORE

[Captioner] 20:55:17
 
CONCERN MEASURES AND VIDEOS BEEN 
SHARED AND THAT'S CONCERNING 


[Captioner] 20:55:21
MORE AS WELL.
AND AGAIN THIS IS ABOUT THE

[Captioner] 20:55:28
 RV 
VEHICLES PARKED AROUND THE 
IRVINGTON COMMUNITY AREA.

[Captioner] 20:55:32

SCHOOLS WITHIN 50 FEET DISTANCE, 
WALK AROUND

[Captioner] 20:55:37
 THE NEIGHBORHOOD, 
IT'S VERY CONCERNING WITH THESE 
VEHICLES

[Captioner] 20:55:41
, AND THE

[Captioner] 20:55:46
 PORTION OF THE 
SITUATION THERE.
OKAY?


[Captioner] 20:55:50
I THINK THERE ARE MORE CONCERNS 
AND I WOULD LIKE TO LEARN WHAT'S 
THE CITY'S PRIORITIES AND

[Captioner] 20:55:53
 THE 
NEXT STEPS TOWARDS IT.
THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY.


[Captioner] 20:56:01
>> The Clerk:   MARIE HUGHES 
FOLLOWED BY RU PAUL.


[Captioner] 20:56:05
>> THANK YOU.
MY NAME IS ME HUGHES

[Captioner] 20:56:10
 MARIE HUGHES, LONG

[Captioner] 20:56:14
 
TIME RESIDENT OF FREMONT.
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN BROUGHT UP 


[Captioner] 20:56:18
A LOT OF CONCERNS.
I WILL ADD TO THAT, I WAS

[Captioner] 20:56:23
 
DISAPPOINTED SEEING THIS AGENDA 
ITEM SPENDING ENERGY TO THAT, 


[Captioner] 20:56:27
WHEN THERE ARE SO MANY PRO 
ACTIVE ACTIVITIES WE

[Captioner] 20:56:31
 COULD TAKE 
UP, INCLUDES THE SAFE PARKING 
PROGRAM AND THE

[Captioner] 20:56:35
 CITY SPONSORED 
PROGRAM THAT IS LESS RESTRICTIVE 
BUT IT ALSO INCLUDED WHAT

[Captioner] 20:56:38
 I 
REFERRED TO AS MEETING THE 
HOMELESS WHERE THEY ARE.


[Captioner] 20:56:42
WHICH WOULD SEE DUMPSTERS, PORT

[Captioner] 20:56:47
 
A POTTIES AND OTHER SANITATION 
EQUIPMENT

[Captioner] 20:56:51
 AS LONG AS COMMUNITY 
GUIDELINES BEING PUT

[Captioner] 20:56:55
 IN EXISTING 
ENCAMPMENTS.
AND THIS IS A VERY CHEAP THING 


[Captioner] 20:56:59
TO DO.
AND IF THERE ARE COMMUNITY 
GUIDELINES IN PARTICULAR

[Captioner] 20:57:03
 AND 
DUMPSTERS IN PARTICULAR IT WOULD 
MITIGATE MANY OF THE ISSUES THE

[Captioner] 20:57:06
 
COMMUNITY HAS WITH THESE 
ENCAMPMENTS BY CUTTING DOWN ON 


[Captioner] 20:57:10
THE TRASH, PEOPLE GOING TO THE 
BATHROOM WHEREVER AND CAUSING 
TROUBLE

[Captioner] 20:57:14
.
I'VE BEEN VOLUNTEERING WITH THE 
SAFE PARKING PROGRAM SINCE THE 


[Captioner] 20:57:18
BEGINNING.
DID GET OFF TO A SLOW START.
BUT RECENTLY, MANY MEMBERS

[Captioner] 20:57:21
 OF 
THE PROGRAM HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN 
MOVED TO PERMANENT HOUSING.


[Captioner] 20:57:26
WHICH IS GREAT TO SEE.
AND I THINK NOW THAT IT'S KIND 
OF UP AND RUNNING IT'S

[Captioner] 20:57:30
 TIME TO 
LOOK AT THESE OTHER MEASURES.

MOTHER OF TWO CHILDREN.
WE UNDERSTAND HOME

[Captioner] 20:58:09
LESSNESS KEEPS 
EXPANDING DAY BY DAY AND 
BLOCKING THE WAY

[Captioner] 20:58:13
 WHICH MAKES 
VERY DIFFICULT FOR US TO BIKE OR 
EVEN WALK IN THAT AREA

[Captioner] 20:58:17
.
SINCE FREMONT CITY IS GOING BIKE 
FRIENDLY AND NOWRCHLING 


[Captioner] 20:58:22
COMMUNITY MEMBERS FOR BETTER AND 
HEALTHY LIFESTYLE HOW

[Captioner] 20:58:26
 ABOUT 
CREATING SEPARATE BIKE LANES SO 
WE CAN BIKE SAFELY IN THAT AREA

[Captioner] 20:58:31
.
PARTICULARLY NEAR THE CHURCH, 
SPECIFICALLY INTERSECTION

[Captioner] 20:58:36
 OF 
THORNTON AVENUE AND CHAP EMWAY.

[Captioner] 20:58:39

AND ONE OF THE COUNCILMEMBERS 
MENTIONED HERE THAT FREMONT CITY 


[Captioner] 20:58:43
HAS A RULE THAT ANY VEHICLE

[Captioner] 20:58:48
 IS 
PARKED OVER MORE THAN 92 HOURS, 
THEY

[Captioner] 20:58:52
 CAN TOW.
BUT I'M SAYING SOME

[Captioner] 20:58:57
 HAVE BEEN 
THERE FOR ABOUT A YEAR.
THEY HAVEN'T BEEN MOVED FOR A 


[Captioner] 20:59:01
LONG TIME.
WE DON'T KNOW WHICH KIND OF 
ACTIVITIES ARE GOING INSIDE AND

[Captioner] 20:59:05
 
WE FEEL VERY UNSAFE TO WALKING 
AND BIKING IN THAT AREA SO I

[Captioner] 20:59:09
 
HOPE YOU TAKE APPROPRIATE ACTION 
AND WE ARE WAITING FOR YOU TO 


[Captioner] 20:59:14
TAKE ACTION AGAINST THIS 
HOMELESSNESS AREA NEAR IRVINGTON

>> HELLO COUNCILMEMBERS.
I LIVE IN IRVINGTON

[Captioner] 20:59:30
, I WORK IN 
SAN FRANCISCO.
I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE AN A

[Captioner] 20:59:34
PEC 
SUMMIT HERE.
YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED HERE

[Captioner] 20:59:38
, 
BECAUSE OF APEC SUMMIT SAN 
FRANCISCO IS

[Captioner] 20:59:43
 CLEAN, NO HOMELESS.
XI JINPING HERE AND THE CITY 
WILL

[Captioner] 20:59:46
 BE CLEAN.
I THINK THAT IS THE BEST 
APPROACH.


[Captioner] 20:59:50
I MEAN IT'S SHAMELESS THERE ARE 
NEEDLES ON THE ROAD,

[Captioner] 20:59:54
 KIDS ARE 
WALKING, AND THERE WAS A CASE

[Captioner] 20:59:58
 
HERE MESSAGE DATE WAS THE LONG 
KNIFE WAS TAKEN OUT

[Captioner] 21:00:02
 AND POINTED 
TOWARDS A KID.
THE VICTIM, THE PERSON WHO 


[Captioner] 21:00:07
CALLED THE 911 IS HERE.
SO NOTHING HAPPENED BECAUSE SOME 
OF YOU LIVE

[Captioner] 21:00:10
 IN THE GATED 
COMMUNITY SO YOU DON'T HAVE THE 
PROBLEM OF THE HOMELESS.


[Captioner] 21:00:15
YOU KNOW PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE 
PROBLEM OF THE HOMELESS WHO HAS 
TO WALK THROUGH THAT

[Captioner] 21:00:19
 STREET, SEE 
THE NEEDLE EVERY DAY SEE THAT 
PEOPLE ARE TAKING DRUGS.

[Captioner] 21:00:23

THEY HAVE THE PROBLEM.
YOU GUYS DON'T HAVE THE PROBLEM.


[Captioner] 21:00:27
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT HOMELESSNESS, 
WE LOVE HOMELESS PEOPLE

[Captioner] 21:00:32
 BUT NOT 
IN FRONT OF MY HOME.
IF IT GOES IN FRONT OF

[Captioner] 21:00:36
 YOUR HOME 
YOU SAY WE DON'T WANT IT.
YOU ARE TRYING TO

[Captioner] 21:00:40
 UNDERSTAND, 
BUILDING THE FUTURE OF THE

[Captioner] 21:00:44
 
SILICON VALLEY, YOU DON'T FOCUS 
ON THE KIDS YOU FOCUS

[Captioner] 21:00:48
 MORE ON 
THE HOMELESS PEOPLE.
WHAT DID NEWARK DID, THEY DIDN'T 


[Captioner] 21:00:52
TAKE ANY OF THAT FUND, YOU GUYS 
TOOK THEIR FUND TO OPEN

[Captioner] 21:00:56
 A 
HOMELESS SHELTER HERE.
ONLY ONE COUNCILMEMBER

[Captioner] 21:01:00
 VOTED NO 
FOR THAT.
YOU ALL VOTED YES.


[Captioner] 21:01:05
I KNOW HOW YOU ALL GUYS VOTED 
IT.
SO WHY THIS PROBLEM

[Captioner] 21:01:09
 IS, WHY IS 
THIS NOT IN

[Captioner] 21:01:14
 LOS GATOS, ONLY OUR 
NEIGHBORHOOD CITY, THIS ELECTION

[Captioner] 21:01:17

ELECTIONS ARE COMING IN DECEMBER 
JUST ONE YEAR AWAY.


[Captioner] 21:01:21
WE KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING BEHIND 
THE SCENES.
CARS

[Captioner] 21:01:25
 PARKED MORE THAN 72 HOURS, 
WE HAVE TAKEN PICTURES, NO 
ACTION IS EVER TAKEN

[Captioner] 21:01:29
.
>> The Clerk:   THANK YOU.
THE NEXT SPEAKER IS SANDIA 


[Captioner] 21:01:33
FOLLOWED BY ASH.
>> I'M SANDIA, A

[Captioner] 21:01:37
 MOTHER OF TWO 
KIDS, ONE IN ELEMENTARY ONE IN 
MIDDLE SCHOOL.

[Captioner] 21:01:41

BOTH OF THE SCHOOLS FALL IN THE 
AREA OF CHAPEL WAY AND

[Captioner] 21:01:46
 IRVINGTON 
AVENUE AND I HAVE PERSONALLY 
SEEN, I TAKE LOT OF

[Captioner] 21:01:50
 WALKS AROUND 
THE AREA AND I PERSONALLY HAVE 
SEEN LOT OF NEEDLES ON

[Captioner] 21:01:54
 THE 
GROUND AND I'VE ALSO SEEN THE 
AREA SIDEWALKS BEING IMPAIRED ON 


[Captioner] 21:01:58
CERTAIN DAYS.
SO I UNDERSTAND ONE OF THE

[Captioner] 21:02:02
 LOOKS 
LIKE CERTAIN THINGS CAN MANDATE 
AN ACTION FROM THE

[Captioner] 21:02:05
 CITY LIKE 
IMPAIRMENT OF SIDEWALKS AND BIKE 
LANES.


[Captioner] 21:02:11
I HAVE SEEN NEEDLES AND HAVE 
ALSO SEEN

[Captioner] 21:02:15
 GRAVITY ON BUSINESSES 
ON GRIMMER AND BASE STREET.
THAT MEANS

[Captioner] 21:02:19
 THERE ARE DRUG 
ACTIVITIES HAPPENING THERE.
I WON'T BE AWARE OF SOME INSIDE 


[Captioner] 21:02:23
THINGS BUT DEFINITELY SOME 
UNDERHANDED THINGS ARE 
HAPPENING.


[Captioner] 21:02:27
ASSUMING THAT THE HOMELESS YES 
THERE SHOULD BE A HUMANITARIAN 
APPROACH BUT

[Captioner] 21:02:32
 FIRST PRIORITY IS 
THEY SHOULD NOT BE AROUND THE 
SCHOOLS BECAUSE YOU DON'T

[Captioner] 21:02:35
 KNOW 
WHO ARE IN THE RIVES.
ARE THEY GENUINE ELDERLY PEOPLE 


[Captioner] 21:02:39
WHO HAVE LOST THEIR JOBS, PEOPLE 
WHO ARE IN

[Captioner] 21:02:44
 HAVING INCIDENCE 
ISSUES AND GENUINELY ARE THERE 
PEOPLE WITH MENTAL

[Captioner] 21:02:48
 ISSUES, WITH 
ADDICTION ISSUES, HOW ARE WE 
SEGREGATE

[Captioner] 21:02:52
ING IT, HOW CAN THE CITY 
GUARANTEE THAT MY

[Captioner] 21:02:56
 CHILD WILL NOT 
BE HURT OR ANY CHILD IN THAT 
AREA WILL NOT BE HURT

[Captioner] 21:03:01
.
THERE HAVE BEEN INSTANCES WHERE 
CHILDREN HAVE BEEN

[Captioner] 21:03:05
 FOLLOWED, 
WHERE FOLKS HAVE TRIED TO TALK 
TO THE KIDS

[Captioner] 21:03:09
 AND INTIMIDATED 
THEM.
IT HAS BEEN REPORT

[Captioner] 21:03:13
ED, WILL THE 
CITY TAKE ACTION WHEN SOMETHING 
REALLY BAD HAPPENS LIKE THE

[Captioner] 21:03:17
 RAPE 
CASE WHICH HAPPENED TWO YEARS 
BACK OR WILL THE CITY TAKE 


[Captioner] 21:03:21
ACTION BEFORE THAT, THAT IS THE 
QUESTION HERE.
>> HI,

[Captioner] 21:03:26
 THIS IS ASHISH AND I'M A 
FREMONT RESIDENT FOR THE LAST 12 
YEARS

[Captioner] 21:03:30
.
THERE HAVE BEEN MULTIPLE 
INCIDENCES WHERE WE HAVE SEEN

[Captioner] 21:03:34
 
ACCIDENTS HAPPENING IN THIS AREA 
OF CHAPEL WAY.


[Captioner] 21:03:38
ESPECIALLY IF YOU DRIVE AROUND 
THAT ROAD YOU CAN SEE OPEN 
PROPANE

[Captioner] 21:03:43
 TANKS OUTSIDE THESE 
RVs

[Captioner] 21:03:47
 WHICH IS A MAJOR TRAFFIC 
RISK.
I USED TO BIKE

[Captioner] 21:03:51
 TO THE STREET BUT 
I HAVE STOPPED BECAUSE MANY 
TIMES THESE HOMELESS PEOPLE

[Captioner] 21:03:55
 JUST 
JUMP IN FRONT OF THE BIKES AND 
START SHOUTING,

[Captioner] 21:04:00
 START SCREENING.
MANY TIMES YOU USED TO COME BACK 
FROM WORK

[Captioner] 21:04:04
, THESE FOLKS WERE 
JUMPING IN FRONT OF THE CARS, 
ASKING FOR $

[Captioner] 21:04:08
50, THESE PUBLIC 
INSTANCES HAVE BECOME AN EVERY

[Captioner] 21:04:14

EVERYDAY INSTANCE.
NEAR OSGOOD ROAD, NEAR

[Captioner] 21:04:17
 THE 
SAFEWAY, THE SIDEWALKS ARE 
ALWAYS CRAMMED WITH LOTS OF 


[Captioner] 21:04:21
GARBAGE AND TRASH ON THOSE 
CARTS, AND IT'S JUST NOT 
POSSIBLE TO

[Captioner] 21:04:26
 CROSS THOSE BRIDGES 
VIA FOOT SOMETIMES.
THESE THINGS ARE BECOMING

[Captioner] 21:04:29
 CRAZY 
THESE DAYS.
PLEASE DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.

 THAT 
NEIGHBORHOOD WITH MY FAMILY BUT 
IN THE RECENT YEARS WE NO LONGER 


[Captioner] 21:05:09

HOMELESS PEOPLE.
THESE PEOPLE ARE OFTEN HIGH ON 


[Captioner] 21:05:13
DRUGS AND CHASE PEOPLE AND CARS 
AND THROW STUFF.
I LIVE ON THE CHAPEL WAY

[Captioner] 21:05:16
 IN

SCHOOL.


[Captioner] 21:05:20
AS A REASON OF THIS HOMELESSNESS 
BROKEN CARS ALWAYS ABANDON

[Captioner] 21:05:25
ED 
CARS AND THEIR ACTS AND WE HAVE 
BEEN SUFFERING MORE THAN ANYONE 


[Captioner] 21:05:29
ELSE.
DUE TO THE PRESENCE OF THE 
HOMELESS PEOPLE ON THE STREET, 


[Captioner] 21:05:34
DEBRIS AND THEIR ACTS IT IS 
EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO LIVE WALK

[Captioner] 21:05:38
 
OR BIKE IN THAT NEIGHBORHOOD.
AT TIMES WE WAKE UP TO THESE 


[Captioner] 21:05:42
PEOPLE SCREAMING IN THE MIDDLE 
OF THE NIGHT AND BECOME TOO 
FRIGHTENED TO EEN LEAVE THE

[Captioner] 21:05:46
 EVEN LEAVE THE 
HOUSE DURING THE DAY

[Captioner] 21:05:50
.
I REQUEST THE HONORABLE MAYOR OF 
THE CITY

[Captioner] 21:05:54
 TO EVICT THE PEOPLE 
FROM THERE, FOR THE STUDENTS

[Captioner] 21:05:57
 OF 
HORNER JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL I

[Captioner] 21:06:08
>> GOOD EVENING, I'M RESIDENT 
OF, AN A RESIDENT

[Captioner] 21:06:13
 OF IRVINGTON 
SCHOOL DISTRICT.
AS A LOT OF PEOPLE SAID

[Captioner] 21:06:17
, DAY BY 
DAY LOT OF ACTIVITIES ARE GOING 
ON, PEOPLE ARE SCARED TO

[Captioner] 21:06:21
 WALK.
AND EVEN TOTALLY SPEAKING I'M

[Captioner] 21:06:25
 
REGRETTING MOVING INTO FREMONT.
AND I KNOW COUPLE OF MY

[Captioner] 21:06:31
 FRIENDS, 
THEY'RE NOT INTERESTED TO MOVE 
INTO FREMONT BECAUSE

[Captioner] 21:06:34
 THEY'RE 
SCARED.
THEY'RE THINKING THAT FREMONT 


[Captioner] 21:06:39
ALSO BECOME NEXT SAN FRANCISCO.
AND YOU DON'T

[Captioner] 21:06:43
 HAVE ANY TRY, 
AFTER INVESTING LOT OF MONEY

[Captioner] 21:06:47
 
LIKE SOME PEOPLE YOU KNOW THEY 
ARE PAYING LIKE A

[Captioner] 21:06:51
 300 K. 400 K 
MORE THAN ASKING PRICE AND 
BUYING THE HOUSES

[Captioner] 21:06:55
.
EVENTUALLY THEY'RE TURNING INTO 
YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENING NOW.


[Captioner] 21:06:59
AND I CAN SAY COUPLE OF 
INSTANCES, HAVE HAPPENED IN MY 
COMMUNITY, IT IS

[Captioner] 21:07:04
 NOT A GATED 
COMMUNITY.
AND WE HAVE SEEN

[Captioner] 21:07:08
 RANDOM PEOPLE 
WALKING INTO THE COMMUNITY AND 
PICKING THROUGH

[Captioner] 21:07:12
 THE COURSE AND 
IF THERE ARE ANY KIDS ARE THERE 
THEY ARE SHOUTING

[Captioner] 21:07:16
 AT THEM AND 
GOING CLOSE TO THEM AND TRYING 
TO GRAB THEIR THINGS.


[Captioner] 21:07:21
AND NOT EVEN FOR THE KIDS.
EVEN THE PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING IN 
THE EARLY MORNING,

[Captioner] 21:07:25
 WHO HAS TO 
DRIVE THEY ARE ALSO SEEING THE 
PEOPLE COMING INTO AND BLOCKING

[Captioner] 21:07:29
 
THE DRIVEWAY.
SO THIS IS REALLY HAPPENING

[Captioner] 21:07:34
 IN 
MY COMMUNITY.
HAPPENING IN MY COMMUNITY.

[Captioner] 21:07:38

AND MY KIDS ARE SCARED TO GO OUT 
ALONE EVEN

[Captioner] 21:07:41
 TO THE NEIGHBOR'S 
HOUSE.
MY WIFE ALSO SCARED TO COME OUT 


[Captioner] 21:07:45

HOMELESS THING IS GOING ON AND 
ON.


[Captioner] 21:08:18
I WANT TO GIVE A FEW SOLUTIONS.
THE PROBLEMS ARE THERE.
BUT NOBODY IS TALKING

[Captioner] 21:08:23
 ABOUT THE 
SOLUTIONS.
THE RVs IN

[Captioner] 21:08:27
 FREMONT FIRST OF 
ALL HAVE TO BE COUNTERED HOW 
MANY

[Captioner] 21:08:31
 RVs THERE ARE, PEOPLE 
DISCUSSED THAT BEFORE.
THERE ARE

[Captioner] 21:08:37
 MANY, MANY RENTAL RV 
PLACES IN FREMONT, RENT

[Captioner] 21:08:41
 THEM, 
ASK THEM TO MOVE INTO THESE

[Captioner] 21:08:45
 RV 
PLACES, THE CITY IS RENT

[Captioner] 21:08:50
ING 
THREE HOTELS,

[Captioner] 21:08:54
 AND HOMING THE 
PEOPLE WHO DESERVE IT DURING THE 
WINTER MONTHS

[Captioner] 21:09:00
.
IF THERE IS A MONEY ISSUE WE 
WILL RAISE THE MONEY.

[Captioner] 21:09:05

BUT MOVE THESE RVs OUT WHERE

[Captioner] 21:09:09
 
PEOPLE'S LIVES ARE AT STAKE.
IRVINGTON IS BECOMING A GHETTO,

[Captioner] 21:09:13
 
WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE FIX 
THIS

[Captioner] 21:09:18
 ISSUE BEFORE, GOD FORBID, 
SOMETHING

[Captioner] 21:09:22
 HAPPENS.
IF SOMETHING HAPPENS THEN ALL 
MUCH US INCLUDING ALL OF YOU 


[Captioner] 21:09:27
WILL BE RESPONSIBLE, BECAUSE 
WEEK AFTER WEEK PEOPLE ARE

[Captioner] 21:09:31
 
COMING AND SPEAKING ABOUT IT, IT 
IS A VERY SERIOUS MATTER

[Captioner] 21:09:35
.
IT HAS TO BE TAKEN UP VERY 
URGENTLY, VERY

[Captioner] 21:09:39
 IMPORTANT.
AND THE LAST THING IS THAT I 
HAVE

[Captioner] 21:09:44
 OFFERED, I HAVE IN 
POSSESSION OF A HOTEL BUILDING

[Captioner] 21:09:48
 
THAT I WOULD LIKE TO OFFER TO 
THE CITY OF FREMONT, FOR HOUSING 


[Captioner] 21:09:52
THE PEOPLE DURING THESE WINTER 
MONTHS.

[Captioner] 21:09:57

THE FEW MINOR REPAIRS THAT HAVE 
TO BE DONE IF PEOPLE COOPERATE 


[Captioner] 21:10:00

VERY QUICKLY.

IS SUDEE

[Captioner] 21:10:20
P, ALONG WITH ALL THE 
OTHER PEOPLE

[Captioner] 21:10:23
 IN THE IRVINGTON 
NEIGHBORHOOD.
I'VE BEEN IN FREMONT FOR OVER 


[Captioner] 21:10:28
TEN YEARS, SAME IN IRVINGTON 
COMMUNITY AND LAST YEAR STARTED 
WITH ONE

[Captioner] 21:10:32
 OR TWO RVs BY THE 
CHURCH, SLOWLY BECOMING LIKE

[Captioner] 21:10:36
 A 
LITTLE RV PARK.
A LOT OF THESE VEHICLES ARE NOT

[Captioner] 21:10:39
 
EVEN MOVABLE.
THESE CHAIRS AND THE PROPANE 


[Captioner] 21:10:43
TANKS AND EVERYTHING ELSE CAN 
COME OUT.
YOU CAN DRIVE BY AND KNOW

[Captioner] 21:10:46
 THAT 
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS NOT 
MOVABLE.


[Captioner] 21:10:51
WITH THAT THERE ARE LOTS OF 
THESE UNSAFE ENVIRONMENTS.
YOU KNOW KIDS

[Captioner] 21:10:55
, THERE ARE THREE 
SCHOOLS LITERALLY, HORN

[Captioner] 21:11:00
ER MIDDLE 
SCHOOL IS ACROSS THE STREET 1700 
PLUS STUDENTS GOING THERE

[Captioner] 21:11:04
 ALONG 
WITH STAFF AND EVERYONE.
YOU

[Captioner] 21:11:08
 HAVE HEMP HIRSCH

[Captioner] 21:11:13
 ELEMENTARY, 
LOT OF KIDS FROM THE COMMUNITY 
GO TO THE HIGH SCHOOL AND THEY

[Captioner] 21:11:17
 
ARE ALL WALKING THERE AND THEY 
ALL HAVE TO KIND OF DODGE THESE

[Captioner] 21:11:20
 
AREAS AND MAKE SURE THEY'RE 
WALKING WITH GROUPS OR LIKE 


[Captioner] 21:11:24
PARENTS HAVE TO DRIVE OR WALK 
THEM.
THERE'S NO PARKING.


[Captioner] 21:11:28
THERE ARE A LOT OF OTHER KIDS 
FROM LIKE MISSION, MISSION HILLS

[Captioner] 21:11:32
 
AND ALL THAT.
THEY'RE ALL COMING TO HORNER AS 


[Captioner] 21:11:36
WELL.
THERE IS NO PARKING.
SO THE ONE-WAY STREET ON

[Captioner] 21:11:40
 THIS 
IRVINGTON BETWEEN LIKE THE 
CHAPEL WAY

[Captioner] 21:11:44
 AND GRIMMER, IT'S 
LITERALLY TRAFFIC JAM.
AND

[Captioner] 21:11:48
 WE SHOULD REALLY HAVE SOME 
SAFE PARKING IN THE SAFE BIKE TO

[Captioner] 21:11:53
 
SCHOOL, ALL THAT AS WELL AS LIKE 
I'VE SEEN LIKE

[Captioner] 21:11:57
 THE STRATFORD 
AVENUE THE

[Captioner] 21:12:01
 STANFORD AVENUE BY 
MISSION, BECAME NO PARKING 
NOBODY

[Captioner] 21:12:06
 IS ALLOWED TO PARK DURING 
SOME TIME.
WHY DON'T WE DO

[Captioner] 21:12:10
 THAT FOR SAFETY 
OF KIDS, WHY NOT DO PROACTIVE

[Captioner] 21:12:13
 
RATHER THAN REACTIVE.
THERE WERE SOME 911 CALLS GOING 


[Captioner] 21:12:18
ON IN THE COMMUNITY SO PLEASE 
HELP, THANK YOU.
>> The Clerk:   NEXT SPEAKER IS

[Captioner] 21:12:22
 
ROSE FOLLOWED BY VENUS.


[Captioner] 21:12:29
>> GOOD EVENING COUNCILMEMBERS 
AND THANK YOU ALL THE 
COUNCILMEMBERS

[Captioner] 21:12:33
 TO ACKNOWLEDGE, 
IN ACKNOWLEDGING THIS ISSUE 
TODAY AND MAKING

[Captioner] 21:12:37
 IT AS A 
SPECIFIC AGENDA.
I WOULD JUST LIKE

[Captioner] 21:12:42
 TO BRING 
ATTENTION TO ONE THING.

[Captioner] 21:12:46

IN THE PRESENTATION ONE OF THE 
SLIDES WAS THE FOLLOWING 


[Captioner] 21:12:50
VIOLATIONS ARE LIKELY TO RESULT 
IN IMMEDIATE ENFORCEMENT

[Captioner] 21:12:54
.
WHICH INCLUDES DUMPING OF 
MATERIALS OR LIQUIDS

[Captioner] 21:12:59
, THEN 
TRESPASSING, LOITERING OR 
DUMPING

[Captioner] 21:13:03
 ON PRIVATE PROPERTIES, 
NO NONOPERABLE

[Captioner] 21:13:09
 OR IMMOBILE 
VEHICLES AND STRUCTURES ON THE 
CITY STREETS, UNREGISTERED

[Captioner] 21:13:12
 OR 
EXPIRED VEHICLES.
CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES INCLUDING 


[Captioner] 21:13:16
BUT NOT LIMITED TO THEFT 
THREATS, THREATS

[Captioner] 21:13:21
 OF VIOLENCE AND 
DRUG SOLICITATION.
SO ON THIS STREET, WHICH

[Captioner] 21:13:25
 
EVERYBODY HAS TALKED ABOUT, 
BEGIN AND AGAIN, ALL THESE 


[Captioner] 21:13:29
GUIDELINES HAVE BEEN VIOLATED, 
ARE BEING VIOLATED EVERY DAY

[Captioner] 21:13:34
.
EVEN TONIGHT, IF YOU JUST DRIVE 
BY THAT ROAD, YOU WOULD SEE

[Captioner] 21:13:38
 ONE 
GRAY COLOR CAR WHOSE DOORS WILL 
BE HALF

[Captioner] 21:13:42
 OPEN AND THERE IS A 
PROPANE

[Captioner] 21:13:47
 CYLINDER UNDER THAT CAR 
WHICH IS A HUGE RISK.
AGAIN THOUSANDS OF CHILDREN WALK 


[Captioner] 21:13:50
EVERY DAY USING THAT ROAD.
I WOULD LIKE TO UNDERSTAND ONE 
THING.


[Captioner] 21:13:54
WHAT IS THE IMMEDIATE ACTION WE 
CAN TAKE?
I DO UNDERSTAND THAT YOU KNOW 


[Captioner] 21:13:59
THERE ARE LEGAL THINGS WHICH ARE 
INVOLVED, IT WILL STAY TIME.
THERE ARE OTHER THINGS

[Captioner] 21:14:04
 WHICH ARE 
ASSOCIATED.
AS ONE OF THE MEMBERS SUGGESTED,

[Captioner] 21:14:08
 
THAT RVs HAVE TO BE DEALT 
DIFFERENTLY, I WOULD REALLY

[Captioner] 21:14:11
 
APPRECIATE ALL OF THIS BUT I 
WOULD REALLY LIKE TO UNDERSTAND 


[Captioner] 21:14:15
WHAT IS THE IMMEDIATE ACTION AS, 
YOU KNOW, AS A COMMUNITY WE CAN 
TAKE.

[Captioner] 21:14:19

WE ALL CAN TAKE.
YOU KNOW, WHICH IS FOR

[Captioner] 21:14:22
 THE 
SAFETY AND SECURITY OF THE KIDS.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 21:14:31
>> The Clerk:   THANK YOU.
VENUS FOLLOWED BY NASSIR.

[Captioner] 21:14:35

>> GOOD EVENING.
SO I JUST HAVE COUPLE OF 


[Captioner] 21:14:40
QUESTIONS.
SO WE WERE HERE, I WAS HERE LAST 
TIME TALKING

[Captioner] 21:14:45
 ABOUT THE WHOLE 
ENCAMPMENTS AROUND IRVINGTON AND 
THE CHAPEL

[Captioner] 21:14:49
 WAY.
BUT I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO ASK 
YOU,

[Captioner] 21:14:53
 WHAT ARE YOU GUYS TRYING TO 
DO?
ARE YOU TRYING TO COMPROMISE ON 


[Captioner] 21:14:58
KIDS AND SENIORS AND THE 
COMMUNITIES SAFETY ARE WE 
PUTTING THEIR

[Captioner] 21:15:03
 LIFE UNDER RISK?
ARE WE WAITING FOR SOME INCIDENT 
TO HAPPEN?


[Captioner] 21:15:07
I'M NOT SURE WHAT WE ARE TRYING 
TO THINK HERE.
WE SHOULD

[Captioner] 21:15:11
 ACTUALLY AT LEAST HAVE 
SOME ACTION PLAN AND SEIZE AT

[Captioner] 21:15:15
 
LEAST FOR THE THINGS WHICH WE 
ARE -- FOR THE ONES

[Captioner] 21:15:20
 WHICH WE 
SHOWED IN JUST A WHILE AGO IN 
THE PRESENTATION,

[Captioner] 21:15:24
 THERE WERE SO 
MANY THINGS, SO MANY VIOLATIONS

[Captioner] 21:15:28
 
ARE HAPPENING ON THAT CHAPEL AND 
THE BAY STREET BUT THERE IS NO 


[Captioner] 21:15:33
ACTIONS, THOSE RVs LIKE SOME 
OF THEM HAVE MENTIONED

[Captioner] 21:15:37
 AND SOME 
CARS WHICH ARE VERY SHADY, I 
PASSED BY JUST

[Captioner] 21:15:41
 NOW BEFORE COMING 
TO THIS MEETING I JUST PASSED BY 
THE ROAD AND I WAS

[Captioner] 21:15:45
 SEEING SO 
MANY SHADY CAR, I WAS SEEING 
PEOPLE DOING LOT

[Captioner] 21:15:49
 OF DIFFERENT 
ACTIVITIES OVER THERE.
AND I'M SURE IF YOU PASS BY THAT 


[Captioner] 21:15:53
ROAD YOU MIGHT ALSO MIGHT 
ENCOUNTER THESE THINGS AND WE 
JUST HAVE REPORTED ONE

[Captioner] 21:15:58
 INCIDENT 
THAT SOMEONE WAS ATTACKED BY A 
PERSON FROM -- ON

[Captioner] 21:16:02
 THAT STREET.
AND I'M SURE THEY'RE GOING TO 
CALL 911 AND REPORT

[Captioner] 21:16:06
 THIS ISSUE.
BUT I'M NOT SURE IF THERE IS 
GOING TO BE ANY ACTION ON THESE

[Captioner] 21:16:10
 
THINGS.
I JUST HAVE ONE QUESTION TONIGHT

[Captioner] 21:16:14

TONIGHT:  WHY ARE WE TRYING TO 
COMPROMISE ON KID SAFETY OR 


[Captioner] 21:16:19
SENIOR SAFETY AND OUR COMMUNITY 
SAFETY?
ARE WE NOT

[Captioner] 21:16:22
 THE CITIZENS, 
RESPONSIBLE CITIZENS TO TAKE 
SOME ACTION?


[Captioner] 21:16:27
THANK YOU.
[APPLAUSE]
>> The Clerk:   THEN THE LAST 


[Captioner] 21:16:32
SPEAKER IS NASSIR.


[Captioner] 21:16:41
>> GOOD EVENING, MAYOR LILY

[Captioner] 21:16:44
 MEI 
AND CITY COUNCIL.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR LISTENING.


[Captioner] 21:16:48
SOME OF US WERE HERE LAST WEEK, 
VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT THE

[Captioner] 21:16:52
 
DISCUSSION THAT WAS ONGOING.
SIMILAR CONCERNS WERE ADDRESSED 


[Captioner] 21:16:57
FOR THE KID SAFETY, FOR THE 
SENIORS, AND FOR THE HOMEOWNERS 
THAT

[Captioner] 21:17:01
 LIVE AROUND THERE.
I GREW UP IN SAN FRANCISCO MOST

[Captioner] 21:17:04
 
OF MY LIFE.
I KNOW FREMONT WANTED TO BE A ME 


[Captioner] 21:17:09
TOO CITY, WHERE A LOT OF BIKE 
LANES WERE IMPLEMENTED IN THE

[Captioner] 21:17:13
 
PAST THREE, FOUR YEARS.
SO WHY NOT ADAPT SOME BETTER 


[Captioner] 21:17:17
BEST PRACTICES FROM CITY OF SAN 
FRANCISCO.
SO THEY HAVE VERY STRICT 


[Captioner] 21:17:21
GUIDELINES ON THE PARKING.
SO I GREW UP IN A NEIGHBORHOOD

[Captioner] 21:17:25
 
WHERE THE STREET PARKING, 
CLEANING WAS ONCE A WEEK, TWO 


[Captioner] 21:17:30
HOURS, 12 TO NOON.
NO VEHICLES ALLOWED.
AND THEY

[Captioner] 21:17:34
 WERE ENFORCED BY 
TICKETING.
SO EVERY SINGLE VEHICLE HAD TO

[Captioner] 21:17:38
 
MOVE SO IT COULD BE SWEPT.
SO LAST WEEK I TOOK THAT

[Captioner] 21:17:42
 
APPROACH AND I DID E-MAIL FOR 
THE STREET CLEANING.


[Captioner] 21:17:46
I GOT A RESPONSE BACK, MOVE YOUR 
VEHICLE.
I CAN'T MOVE THOSE VEHICLES, 


[Captioner] 21:17:50
THOSE ARE NOT MINE.
SO THE CITY NEEDS TO HAVE THE 
LAWS THAT ARE ALREADY

[Captioner] 21:17:54
 IN PLACE.
I WAS IMPRESSED WITH THE 
PRESENTATION.


[Captioner] 21:17:58
BUT WE'RE JUST GOING AROUND AND 
AROUND AND AROUND.
WE HAVE LAWS THAT

[Captioner] 21:18:02
 THE CITY CAN 
TAKE AND IMPLY AND IMPLEMENT 
THEM.

[Captioner] 21:18:06

SO STREET CLEANING, VERY SIMPLE.
PUT UP THE SIGNAGE

[Captioner] 21:18:11
S, MOVE THOSE 
VEHICLES.
AND AS ROSE HAS PLEASANTED

[Captioner] 21:18:13
 
EARLIER ALL THOSE ARE ALREADY IN 
VIOLATION.


[Captioner] 21:18:17
SO I'M NOT SURE WHAT ADDITIONAL 
LAWS THAT WE NEED TO LOOK INTO

[Captioner] 21:18:21
.
THAT WE'LL BE VIOLATING.
FOR ME THE KID SAFETY,

[Captioner] 21:18:26
 THE 
RESIDENTS, THE PROPERTY OWNERS, 
THE SENIORS ARE NUMBER 1 


[Captioner] 21:18:29
PRIORITY.
THANK YOU.
[APPLAUSE]


[Captioner] 21:18:37
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.
AT THIS TIME I'LL BRING IT BACK 
TO THE COUNCIL FOR

[Captioner] 21:18:41
 COMMENTS, 
UNLESS SOME OF THE STAFF WOULD 
LIKE TO COMMENT OR CLARIFY

[Captioner] 21:18:44
 ANY 
OF THE ITEMS.
I DO KNOW THAT WE HAVE HAD SOME 


[Captioner] 21:18:49
STREET CLEANUPS AND IN 
PARTICULAR AS I MENTIONED I KNOW 
THAT YOU'VE CLEARED OUT ONE

[Captioner] 21:18:53
 SIDE  
SIDE OF THE STREET WHICH IS 
ADJACENT TO

[Captioner] 21:18:57
 THE CEMETERY SINCE 
THAT TIME.
YOU I APOLOGIZE,

[Captioner] 21:19:01
 I KNOW OUR 
IRVINGTON DISTRICT COUNCILMEMBER 
IS NOT HERE THIS EVENING BUT

[Captioner] 21:19:05
 
WE'LL TURN IT OVER TO 
COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL.


[Captioner] 21:19:09
DID YOU HAVE COMMENTS AT THIS 
TIME?

[Captioner] 21:19:14

>> Councilmember Campbell:   
THANK YOU MAYOR MEI AND ALL OF 


[Captioner] 21:19:18
THE SPEAKERS.
I DID TAKE THE TIME.
WE HAD THE

[Captioner] 21:19:23
 JOINT FREMONT UNIFIED 
SCHOOL DISTRICT AND THE CITY 
COUNCIL MEETING

[Captioner] 21:19:27
, AND WE TALKED A 
LOT ABOUT SAFETY AROUND SCHOOLS 
THAT CAME

[Captioner] 21:19:31
 UP, AND I REACHED OUT 
TO THE SUPERINTENDENT KNOWING 
THAT WE WERE

[Captioner] 21:19:35
 GOING TO HAVE THIS 
AGENDA ITEM TONIGHT.
JUST TO SORT OF

[Captioner] 21:19:39
 GET AN IDEA OF 
WHAT HIS THOUGHT WAS

[Captioner] 21:19:44
 AROUND 
SAFETY AROUND SCHOOLS.
AND AGAIN, YOU KNOW, IT'S THAT 


[Captioner] 21:19:48
SAFE PATH OF TRAVEL SO THAT 
THESE VEHICLES ARE NOT BLOCKING

[Captioner] 21:19:53
 
ACCESS FOR PARENTS AND STUDENTS 
AND STAFF TO BE ABLE TO GET INTO 


[Captioner] 21:19:58
THE SCHOOL.
HE ALSO SAID, AND THAT'S, YOU 
KNOW, TO AND

[Captioner] 21:20:02
 FROM SCHOOL AND 
HE -- BECAUSE SOMEBODY HAD 
MENTIONED, I

[Captioner] 21:20:06
 THINK IT WAS LAST 
WEEK, THAT RVs ARE PARKED SO 
THAT WHEN YOU

[Captioner] 21:20:10
 -- YOU CAN'T SEE 
AROUND THE CORNER SO YOU HAVE 
TO, YOU KNOW, GET HALFWAY

[Captioner] 21:20:14
 INTO 
THE STREET BEFORE YOU CAN MAKE A 
LEFT OR RIGHT TURN.


[Captioner] 21:20:18
AND SO THAT WAS IMPORTANT TO 
HIM.
THERE WAS ALSO THIS WHOLE IDEA

[Captioner] 21:20:22
 
OF LINE OF SIGHT, SAFETY FOR IN 
CASES OF

[Captioner] 21:20:26
 AN EMERGENCY, HAVING, 
YOU KNOW, BIG RVs THAT YOU 
CAN'T

[Captioner] 21:20:30
 SEE OVER AND YOU CAN'T SEE 
UNDER, BEING A SAFETY

[Captioner] 21:20:35
 HAZARD FOR 
ESPECIALLY AROUND

[Captioner] 21:20:39
 SCHOOLS AND 
PEDESTRIANS.
AND THE PEDESTRIAN FLOW OF 


[Captioner] 21:20:44
TRAFFIC DURING ARRIVAL AND 
PARTICULARLY DISMISSAL AND

[Captioner] 21:20:47
 
ARRIVAL TIMES.
SO I WAS WONDERING IF THERE IS A 


[Captioner] 21:20:51
WAY THAT -- AND WE TALKED A 
LITTLE BIT ABOUT PARKING 
VIOLATIONS AND WHAT

[Captioner] 21:20:55
 THAT MIGHT 
LOOK LIKE.
IS THERE A WAY THAT WE

[Captioner] 21:21:00
 CAN DO 
SOMETHING AROUND -- AND HE JUST 
MENTIONED

[Captioner] 21:21:03
 IT BECAUSE I LIVED ON 
THE EAST COAST AND THEY DID THE 
SAME THING.


[Captioner] 21:21:07
SO NOW YOU COULDN'T PARK ON THE 
STREET.
IN CERTAIN NEIGHBORHOODS

[Captioner] 21:21:12
.
YOU WOULD HAVE TIMES

[Captioner] 21:21:14
 WHEN YOU 
COULD PARK IN CERTAIN 
NEIGHBORHOODS BUT SOMETIMES YOU 


[Captioner] 21:21:18
COULDN'T AND THERE WERE NO 
PARKING SIGNS CLEARLY 
DESIGNATING WHAT

[Captioner] 21:21:22
 THOSE TIMES 
WERE THAT YOU COULD OR COULD NOT 
PARK THERE.


[Captioner] 21:21:27
SO I'M WONDERING IF PARKING LAWS 
OR REGULATIONS OR

[Captioner] 21:21:31
 SOMETHING LIKE 
THAT COULD BE A SOLUTION TO PART 
OF

[Captioner] 21:21:35
 THIS PROBLEM.
>> Mayor Mei:   SO I JUST WANTED 
TO REAL

[Captioner] 21:21:39
 QUICKLY ADD THAT 
RECENTLY THERE WAS LEGISLATE 
THAT

[Captioner] 21:21:44
 
LEGISLATION THAT PASSED FOR LINE 
OF SIGHT AND THAT

[Captioner] 21:21:47
 WILL BEGIN IN 
JANUARY.
I SEE ALSO IN OUR AUDIENCE 


[Captioner] 21:21:51
WHETHER IT'S THE TEAM THAT'S UP 
HERE OR I ALSO SEE THAT OUR 
POLICE IF ANY OF

[Captioner] 21:21:55
 THEM OR OUR 
CITY MANAGER WOULD LIKE TO 
ANSWER SOME OF

[Captioner] 21:21:59
 THESE QUESTIONS 
SPECIFICALLY.


[Captioner] 21:22:13
>> WITH RESPECT TO SOME OF THE 
QUESTIONS ABOUT PARKING OR 
TRAFFIC SAFETY IN GENERAL

[Captioner] 21:22:18
, AS I 
SHARED AT THE JOINT SCHOOL BOARD 
MEETING

[Captioner] 21:22:23
, YOU KNOW, MANY OF THOSE 
ISSUES ARE ADDRESSABLE UNDER OUR

[Captioner] 21:22:28
 
CURRENT LAWS, YOU KNOW, TO THE 
EXTENT THAT OUR TRAFFIC

[Captioner] 21:22:32
 EXPERTS 
IDENTIFY AN UNSAFE TRAFFIC 
SITUATION, THEY

[Captioner] 21:22:36
 CAN INTERVENE TO 
ADDRESS THAT IMMEDIATELY

[Captioner] 21:22:40
.
TO THE EXTENT THAT A SCHOOL 
SEEKS TO CREATE

[Captioner] 21:22:44
 A PICKUP AND 
DROPOFF ZONE AS OPPOSED

[Captioner] 21:22:49
 TO, YOU 
KNOW, JUST A BLANKET NO PARK

[Captioner] 21:22:54
ING 
ENFORCEMENT AROUND THEIR SCHOOL, 
THAT'S ALSO POSSIBLE ON

[Captioner] 21:22:58
 A ONE 
OFF BASIS UNDER OUR CURRENT 
RULES

[Captioner] 21:23:02
.
I WOULD DEFER TO RAFAEL TO 
ADDRESS THE OFFICIAL

[Captioner] 21:23:06
 FOR 
ADDITIONAL REGULATION, YOU KNOW, 
OBVIOUSLY

[Captioner] 21:23:10
 AS WE NOTED EARLIER IN 
THE PRESENTATION THAT'S 
POSSIBLE.


[Captioner] 21:23:14
TO THE EXTENT THAT THAT'S WHAT 
COUNCIL WISHES TO PURSUE.
AND

[Captioner] 21:23:18
 I GUESS I CAN HEAR

[Captioner] 21:23:22
 OUR 
PROFESSIONAL HOMELESS STAFF KIND 
OF IN THE BACK OF MY HEAD AND I

[Captioner] 21:23:26
 
KNOW THAT THEY WOULD WANT ME TO 
UNDERLINE

[Captioner] 21:23:30
 THAT MOVING THE

[Captioner] 21:23:35
 RVs 
DOES NOT INHERENT -- YOU KNOW 
IT'S ACT

[Captioner] 21:23:39
ING ON PARKING 
ENFORCEMENT MIGHT BE SOMETHING 
THAT THE COUNCIL SEEKS TO DO.

[Captioner] 21:23:43

IT IS NOT NECESSARILY GOING TO 
RESOLVE

[Captioner] 21:23:47
 CONCERNS ABOUT SAFETY 
THAT ARE UNRELATED TO

[Captioner] 21:23:51
, YOU KNOW, 
ACTUAL CRIMINAL ACTS OR 
ACTUALITY PARKING.

[Captioner] 21:23:56

SO WE WOULD AS STAFF FOCUS ON

[Captioner] 21:24:00
 
EVIDENCE BASED ISSUES THAT WE 
CAN

[Captioner] 21:24:04
 INTERVENE ON SCIENTIFICALLY

[Captioner] 21:24:08
.
>> Councilmember Campbell:   CAN 
I RESPOND TO YOU OR WOULD YOU 


[Captioner] 21:24:11
LIKE TO RESPOND FIRST?
NO, I HEAR YOU AND I RECOGNIZE 
THAT.


[Captioner] 21:24:16
THAT IT IS NOT A PART OF SORT OF 
SOLVING A PROBLEM.
BUT CLEARLY

[Captioner] 21:24:20
 WITH THE GUIDELINES 
THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW, IT'S NOT 
WORKING.

[Captioner] 21:24:25

BECAUSE THE SAFETY CONCERN, I 
MEAN IT

[Captioner] 21:24:30
 DOESN'T NECESSARILY HAVE 
TO BE A PERSON THAT'S UNSHELTER

[Captioner] 21:24:33

UNSHELTERED THAT'S STAYING IN AN 
RV.


[Captioner] 21:24:37
IN PARTICULAR, IT COULD BE 
ANYBODY.
IT COULD BE ME JUST OVER THERE 


[Captioner] 21:24:41
AND I JUST DECIDE I WANT TO PARK 
THERE FOR HALF A DAY OR WHATEVER 
AND

[Captioner] 21:24:46
 PEOPLE GOT UNCOMFORTABLE BY 
JUST MY -- THE VERY PRESENCE OF

[Captioner] 21:24:49
 
ME BEING THERE.
BUT DOESN'T SAY THAT I'M 


[Captioner] 21:24:53
UNSHELTERED RIGHT OR I'M USING 
MY VEHICLE TO

[Captioner] 21:24:57
 BE HOUSED.
SO THAT IN AND OF ITSELF

[Captioner] 21:25:01
 DOES 
NOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM.
SO THE PROBLEM COMES IN WHEN 


[Captioner] 21:25:05
WE'RE ALLOWING CERTAIN TYPES OF 
VEHICLES TO BE PARKED IN AN AREA 
THAT

[Captioner] 21:25:10
 COULD BE POTENTIALLY UNSAFE 
FOR CHILDREN

[Captioner] 21:25:13
.
RIGHT?
OR POTENTIALLY UNSAFE FOR 


[Captioner] 21:25:18
SENIORS.
AS WE HEARD.
NOT NECESSARILY

[Captioner] 21:25:22
 WHAT AGAIN, THEY 
DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO BE 
UNHOUSED BUT IT COULD BE

[Captioner] 21:25:26
 A 
SAFETY CONCERN.
AND WE KNOW WE HAVE THESE

[Captioner] 21:25:29
 
GUIDELINES.
BUT THE MERE FACT OF HAVING 


[Captioner] 21:25:34
THESE GUIDELINES HASN'T 
PRECLUDED THESE FOLKS FROM 
PARKING IN AREAS THAT MAY

[Captioner] 21:25:38
 BE 
CONSIDERED UNSAFE FOR CHILDREN 
AND SENIORS.

[Captioner] 21:25:42

THAT'S MY POINT.

[Captioner] 21:25:49

>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado:   THE 
FREMONT MUNICIPAL CODE IS 


[Captioner] 21:25:53
CONCERNED WITH SAFETY, TRAFFIC 
REGULATIONS INCLUDING PARKING.
FEEDBACK THIS EVENING

[Captioner] 21:25:57
 IS GOING 
TO BE IMPORTANT.
CITY STAFF WANTS TO RECEIVE THAT 


[Captioner] 21:26:01
PARTICULARLY BECAUSE THERE ARE 
AS WAS MENTIONED, LAWS ON OUR 
BOOKS

[Captioner] 21:26:06
 THAT EXIST THAT WOULD 
ALLOW US TO IMPLEMENT

[Captioner] 21:26:10
 PROGRAMS
[APPLAUSE]
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado:   BUT

[Captioner] 21:26:14
 
AT THE SAME TIME WE HAVE TO MAKE 
SURE THAT THE WAY THAT WE 


[Captioner] 21:26:18
IMPLEMENT CONFORMS TO THE CASE 
LAW THAT WE COVERED TODAY,

[Captioner] 21:26:23
 
INCLUDING AVOIDING 
DISCRIMINATORY

[Captioner] 21:26:28
 ENFORCEMENT, THAT 
CAUSES US TO TAKE CARE OF

[Captioner] 21:26:32
 WHAT 
IS ON THE GROUND AND DOESN'T 
HAVE DISPARATE

[Captioner] 21:26:37
 EFFECTS ON THE 
UNHOUSED POPULATION.

[Captioner] 21:26:41

WE'RE HERE TO LIN AND COME BACK 
WITH OPTIONS.


[Captioner] 21:26:45
>> Mayor Mei:   COUNCILMEMBER 
KASSAN, I WANTED TO CITE IN 
REFERENCE

[Captioner] 21:26:49
 TO COUNCILMEMBER 
CAMPBELL'S COMMENT, I KNOW THE

[Captioner] 21:26:54
 
MAYOR FROM THE

[Captioner] 21:26:58
 CITY OF SAN JOSE, 
MAYOR MAHAN

[Captioner] 21:27:02
, THERE BE NO PARKING 
WITHIN 500 FEET IF I REMEMBER 
CORRECTLY

[Captioner] 21:27:07
 OF SCHOOLS.
IS IT 150?
OKAY THANK YOU

[Captioner] 21:27:10
.
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT IT WOULD 
BE SOMETHING JUST TO CLARIFY FOR 


[Captioner] 21:27:14
PEOPLE IF WE WERE TO IMPLEMENT 
SOMETHING THAT MEANS EVERYONE.
SO NOT JUST I MEAN

[Captioner] 21:27:18
 ONE OF THE 
THINGS THAT I USED TO DO SAFETY 
PATROL FOR YEARS FOR THE SCHOOLS

[Captioner] 21:27:22

SCHOOLS.
AND I HAVE TO SAY SADLY THAT IN 


[Captioner] 21:27:26
DOING SO OVER THE YEARS SOME OF 
THE WORST OFFENDERS FOR SAFETY 
FOR DRIVING AND

[Captioner] 21:27:30
 FOR PARKING AND 
DROPPING OFF LEGALLY IN THE 
STREET ARE ACTUALLY

[Captioner] 21:27:34
 THE STUDENTS 
OR THE PARENTS THEMSELVES.
SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU 


[Captioner] 21:27:39
UNDERSTAND IF THIS IS SOMETHING 
THAT WE ARE GOING TO PURSUE, I'M 
NOT AGAINST THAT IDEA

[Captioner] 21:27:43
 BUT 
UNDERSTAND IF YOU GET THE 
TICKET, WE MAY HEAR FROM SOME

[Captioner] 21:27:47
 OF 
YOU TOO BUT IT HAS TO BE 
UNIFORMLY APPLIED.


[Captioner] 21:27:51
IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE ARE NOT 
GOING TO SAY SOME PEOPLE CAN 
PARK

[Captioner] 21:27:55
 ILLEGALLY, IT MEANS ALL OF 
THE PEOPLE, IF THAT'S THE 
DIRECTION THAT THE COUNCIL

[Captioner] 21:27:58
 
WANTED TO GO.
OKAY COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN.


[Captioner] 21:28:01
>> Councilmember Kassan:   THANK 
YOU.
SO THANK YOU SO MUCH TO STAFF.


[Captioner] 21:28:05
I KNOW YOU ALL ARE DOING A LOT.
AND YOU HAVE VERY LIMITED 
RESOURCES

[Captioner] 21:28:09
.
AND I THINK THAT

[Captioner] 21:28:13
 YOU'RE DOING 
EVERYTHING YOU CAN TO ADDRESS 
THE PROBLEM BOTH WITH 


[Captioner] 21:28:17
ENFORCEMENT WHEN APPROPRIATE AND 
HELP WITH -- HELPING PEOPLE FIND 
ACCESS

[Captioner] 21:28:21
 TO SERVICES IN NEEDED.

[Captioner] 21:28:25

SO IT'S, YOU KNOW, OBVIOUSLY 
THERE IS A HUGE PROBLEM OF 


[Captioner] 21:28:30
HOMELESSNESS IN OUR COMMUNITY 
BUT CREATING NEW PARKING RULES 
WOULDN'T SOLVE THAT PROBLEM

[Captioner] 21:28:34
.
IT WOULD NOT MAGICALLY MAKE 
THESE PEOPLE

[Captioner] 21:28:38
 DISAPPEAR.
AND I DO WANT TO CLARIFY

[Captioner] 21:28:41
 AND 
CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG, STAFF, 
BUT THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A 


[Captioner] 21:28:46
72-HOUR PARKING RULE IN FREMONT.
SO FOR THOSE WHO ARE STATING 
THAT THAT

[Captioner] 21:28:50
 EXISTS, THAT DOES NOT 
EXIST.
AND

[Captioner] 21:28:54
, YOU KNOW, AS MUCH AS WE 
MIGHT LIKE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE 
MORE PARKING RULES

[Captioner] 21:28:59
, I THINK WE 
HAVE TO BE REALLY REALISTIC 
ABOUT

[Captioner] 21:29:03
 OUR ABILITY TO ENFORCE 
THEM.
I GET COMPLAINTS

[Captioner] 21:29:07
 FROM BICYCLISTS 
ABOUT PARKING IN BIKE LANES AND 
IT IS JUST YOU KNOW WE DO

[Captioner] 21:29:11
 HAVE A 
RELATIVELY SMALL POLICE FORCE.
THEY'RE ADDRESSING ALL KINDS OF

[Captioner] 21:29:16
 
ISSUES, GOING AROUND AND ISSUING 
PARKING TICKETS IS

[Captioner] 21:29:19
 NOT, YOU 
KNOW, AT THE TOP OF THEIR 
PRIORITY LIST.


[Captioner] 21:29:23
ESPECIALLY IF, YOU KNOW, THERE 
IS NO FUNDING RESOURCES TO DO 
THAT.


[Captioner] 21:29:27
SO I HOPE THAT WE CAN GO BACK TO 
WHAT WE TALKED TO --

[Captioner] 21:29:31
 TALKED 
ABOUT SEVERAL YEARS AGO, IT 
MAKES ME REALLY SAD THAT WE'VE

[Captioner] 21:29:36
 
STALLED OUT ON THE THREE PRONG 
SAFE PARKING PLAN AND THAT WE'RE

[Captioner] 21:29:40
 
NOW AT A POINT WHERE WE CANNOT 
EVEN ACCOMMODATE EVERYONE WHO 


[Captioner] 21:29:44
WANTS SAFE PARKING AND WE'RE NOT 
ACCOMMODATING RVs.
LIKE I SAID

[Captioner] 21:29:48
 THE MEETING MINUTES 
DO SAY THAT THE SECOND PRONG 
WOULD ONLY COST $17

[Captioner] 21:29:52
,000 A YEAR.
SO I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY WE'RE 
NOT IMPLEMENTING THAT.

[Captioner] 21:29:56

AND, YOU KNOW, THERE WAS, YOU 
KNOW, THE MAJORITY OF THE 


[Captioner] 21:30:00
COUNCIL DID DIRECT STAFF NOT TO 
PURSUE PRONGS 2 AND

[Captioner] 21:30:04
 3 AND I 
THINK THAT WAS A BIG MISTAKE 
BECAUSE NOW WE ARE

[Captioner] 21:30:08
 IN THE 
SITUATION AND HAVING ADDITIONAL 
PARKING RULES IS NOT GOING

[Captioner] 21:30:12
 TO 
SOLVE THE PROBLEM.
WE NEED A PLACE FOR PEOPLE TO 


[Captioner] 21:30:16
STAY THAT IS SAFE FOR THEM WHERE 
THEY ARE NOT GOING TO BE GETTING 
IN PEOPLE'S WAY

[Captioner] 21:30:20
 SO THANK YOU.
>> Councilmember Campbell:   CAN 
I GET A CLARIFYING

[Captioner] 21:30:25
 QUESTION?
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN YOU SAID 
THAT FREMONT

[Captioner] 21:30:29
 MUNICIPAL CODE DOES 
NOT HAVE AN ORDINANCE TO REMOVE 
VEHICLES

[Captioner] 21:30:33
 PARKED ON THE STREET 
FOR MORE THAN 72 HOURS?
IN THIS STAFF REPORT

[Captioner] 21:30:37
 IT SAYS IT 
DOES.
IT SAYS FREMONT MUNICIPAL CODE 


[Captioner] 21:30:41
SECTION 10.05.120, WHICH IS THE

[Captioner] 21:30:45
 
CITY'S LOCAL ORDINANCE THAT 
AUTHORIZES REMOVAL, IS

[Captioner] 21:30:49
 THAT 
DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WE'RE 
TALKING ABOUT?


[Captioner] 21:30:53
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado:   
THERE'S TWO PROVISIONS THAT 
REPLY APPLY

[Captioner] 21:30:58
, THE SECTION IN OUR 
MUNICIPALITY THAT PROHIBITS 
STORAGE OF VEHICLES

[Captioner] 21:31:02
 ON PUBLIC  
RIGHT-OF-WAYS IS 10.05

[Captioner] 21:31:06
.550 THAT 
PROHIBITS ANY PERSON FROM -- LET 
ME

[Captioner] 21:31:10
 JUST READ IT FOR THE RECORD.
THAT SUBSECTION INDICATES AS

[Captioner] 21:31:14
 
FOLLOWS:  NO PERSON WHO OWNS OR 
HAS POSSESSION CUSTODY OR 


[Captioner] 21:31:18
CONTROL OF ANY VEHICLE SHALL 
PARK SUCH VEHICLE UPON ANY 
STREET OR ALLEY

[Captioner] 21:31:22
 FOR MORE THAN A  
CONSECUTIVE PERIOD

[Captioner] 21:31:26
 OF 72 HOURS.
SECTION

[Captioner] 21:31:31
 120 AUTHORIZES TOWING OF 
VEHICLES THAT

[Captioner] 21:31:34
 EXCEED THAT TIME 
FRAME.
>> Councilmember Kassan:   OKAY 


[Captioner] 21:31:38
SO I WAS TOLD BY STAFF THAT WE 
DO NOT HAVE SUCH AN ORDINANCE.
SO SOUNDS LIKE

[Captioner] 21:31:41
 I WAS 
MISINFORMED.
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado:   MY 


[Captioner] 21:31:45
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THIS, 
THESE TWO PROVISIONS ARE CURRENT 
LAW AND

[Captioner] 21:31:49
 THEY ARE INCLUDED IN OUR 
CURRENT VERSION OF THE

[Captioner] 21:31:52
 MUNICIPAL 
CODE AVAILABLE ONLINE.
>> Councilmember Kassan:   OKAY 


[Captioner] 21:31:56
THANK YOU.
>> IT MAY BE COUNCIL AND I TAKE 
NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR MIS

[Captioner] 21:32:00

MISINFORMING YOU BUT IT MAY BE 
THAT THE STAFF THAT WAS DISCUSS

[Captioner] 21:32:04

DISCUSSING IT WITH YOU WERE 
DISCUSSING ENFORCE

[Captioner] 21:32:08
ABILITY AND 
THAT IS A STANCHEONLY LARGER 
HURDLE

[Captioner] 21:32:12
 WHEN YOU ARE -- 
SUBSTANTIALLY LARGER

[Captioner] 21:32:17
 HURDLE WHEN 
YOU TALK ABOUT NOT ONLY THE 2

[Captioner] 21:32:21
40 
PLUS RVs THAT ARE

[Captioner] 21:32:26
 IN THE CITY, 
BUT MORE THAN 72 HOURS THE POINT 
WE WERE MAKING

[Captioner] 21:32:30
 ABOUT CONSISTENT 
ENFORCEMENT EARLIER WAS RELATED 
TO THE FACT THAT WE

[Captioner] 21:32:34
 WOULD NOT 
JUST TARGET THE UNHOUSED TO 
ENFORCE LAW AND NOT

[Captioner] 21:32:37
 ENFORCE IT 
IN THE REST OF THE CITY.
SO THAT IS THE CONCERN THAT 


[Captioner] 21:32:42
STAFF IS FACED WITH.


[Captioner] 21:32:49
>> Mayor Mei:   COUNCILMEMBER 
SALWAN.
>> Councilmember Salwan:   THANK 


[Captioner] 21:32:53
YOU MADAM MAYOR AND THANK YOU TO 
OUR STAFF FOR THE PRESENTATION.
I

[Captioner] 21:32:57
 REALIZE THIS IS A COMPLICATED 
ISSUE, AND I APPRECIATE THE

[Captioner] 21:33:02
 
COMMUNITY'S PASSION.
I KNOW THAT SAFETY IS A TOP MOST 


[Captioner] 21:33:06
CONCERN FOR EVERYONE.
SPEAKING OF SAFETY, I JUST 
WANTED TO HEAR LIKE

[Captioner] 21:33:10
 MAYBE FROM 
OUR CHIEF, IF HE HAS ANY DATA AS 
FAR AS

[Captioner] 21:33:14
 LIKE IS THERE MORE CRIME 
IN THIS AREA OR IS THERE

[Captioner] 21:33:18
 ANY 
TRUTH TO -- THAT THERE'S MORE

[Captioner] 21:33:22
 
CRIME WITH THE HOMELESS 
INDIVIDUALS THERE AND JUST 


[Captioner] 21:33:26
GENERAL I GUESS SO CALLED 
LAWLESS

[Captioner] 21:33:30
NESS IN THAT AREA?
I WANT TO GET SOME FEEDBACK TO 
SEE IF WE

[Captioner] 21:33:34
 CAN ADDRESS THAT FIRST 
AND FOREMOST.


[Captioner] 21:33:44
>> WELL, GOOD AFTERNOON.
GOOD EVENING.
EVERYONE, THANK YOU, THANK YOU

[Captioner] 21:33:48
 
FOR THE QUESTION AND I DON'T 
HAVE A SPECIFIC DATA ON

[Captioner] 21:33:52
 THAT 
PARTICULAR AREA AT THIS TIME.
I CAN CERTAINLY OBTAIN THAT

[Captioner] 21:33:55
 
INFORMATION.
BUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT OUR MET 


[Captioner] 21:33:59
TEAM AND OFFICERS ARE OUT IN 
THAT AREA ON

[Captioner] 21:34:04
 CALLS FOR SERVICE 
REGULARLY TO DEAL WITH

[Captioner] 21:34:07
 SOME OF 
THE REPORTS OF CRIMINAL 
ACTIVITY.


[Captioner] 21:34:11
AND SO I MYSELF HAVE BEEN 
VISITED THAT

[Captioner] 21:34:15
 AREA AND WE 
DEFINITELY HAVE HEARD THE 
COMMUNITY'S

[Captioner] 21:34:19
 CONCERNS REGARDING, 
YOU KNOW, WHAT I WOULD BE 
CONCERNED WITH

[Captioner] 21:34:24
, WHICH WOULD BE 
CRIMINAL ACTIVITY.
AND

[Captioner] 21:34:28
 THE CONVERSATION AROUND 
ENFORCEMENT AND PARK

[Captioner] 21:34:32
ING I MEAN I 
THINK IT WAS SAID ALREADY, THAT 
WE WOULD

[Captioner] 21:34:36
 HAVE TO GO BACK AND 
ASSESS OUR ABILITY TO ENFORCE ON 
A REGULAR

[Captioner] 21:34:40
 BASIS THOSE TYPE OF 
PARKING VIOLATIONS, 
UNDERSTANDING THAT WE HAVE

[Captioner] 21:34:45
 OVER 
90 SQUARE MILES AND QUITE THE 
CHALLENGE WE'RE

[Captioner] 21:34:49
 TRYING TO FAIRLY 
ENFORCE PARK

[Captioner] 21:34:53
ING VIOLATIONS 
THROUGHOUT THE CITY.
SO I CAN

[Captioner] 21:34:57
 CERTAINLY HAVE MY STAFF 
GO BACK AND RESEARCH THE

[Captioner] 21:35:00
 
INFORMATION AS FAR AS WHAT TYPE 
OF CRIMES WE'RE HAVING IN THAT 


[Captioner] 21:35:02
PARTICULAR AREA.
>> Councilmember Salwan:   OKAY, 
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 21:35:06
I THINK I HEARD A FEW TIMES 
ABOUT SOME DECISION WE TOOK A 
FEW

[Captioner] 21:35:10
 YEARS AGO, AND MY 
RECOLLECTION IS WAS THAT STAFF 
HAD

[Captioner] 21:35:14
 SAID THAT THEY WERE TRYING 
TO IDENTIFY A SAFE PARKING

[Captioner] 21:35:19
 SITE.
AND I THINK THAT'S IN THE WORKS.
IS THAT ACCURATE OR

[Captioner] 21:35:24
 --
>> I'M NOT AWARE OF

[Captioner] 21:35:29
 ANY ONGOING 
EFFORT TO IDENTIFY A SAFE 
PARKING SITE.

[Captioner] 21:35:33

AGAIN, WHEN THE HOMELESSNESS

[Captioner] 21:35:36
 
RESPONSE PLAN IS BROUGHT 
FORWARD, COUNCIL WILL BE 


[Captioner] 21:35:41
PRESENTED AGAIN WITH THE OPTION 
TO PURSUE THAT

[Captioner] 21:35:46
 OPTION.
BUT I WOULD NOTE AGAIN, IT 
LIKELY WOULD

[Captioner] 21:35:50
 NOT BE A RESOLUTION

[Captioner] 21:35:54
 
FOR THE CITY'S CONCERNS ABOUT 
RVs AND IT

[Captioner] 21:35:59
 WOULD BE 
SUBSTANTIALLY EXPENSIVE AND

[Captioner] 21:36:04
 
PERHAPS NOT THE BEST BANK FOR 
THE COUNCIL'S BUCK TO THE EXTENT

[Captioner] 21:36:08
 
WE WERE EXPLORING WAYS TO 
EXPLORE

[Captioner] 21:36:13
 HOMELESSNESS.
IT IS CERTAINLY A SUBJECT

[Captioner] 21:36:17
 DURING 
OUR OUTREACH AND IT WILL BE 
BROUGHT TO THE COUNCIL AGAIN

[Captioner] 21:36:20
.
>> THERE WERE SOME SITES LOOKED 
AT YEARS AGO.


[Captioner] 21:36:24
AND THE ONE THAT SEEN, IF MY 
MEMORY SERVES ME CORRECT

[Captioner] 21:36:28
LY, THE 
ONE THAT SEEMS LIKE IT COULD 
HAVE BEEN MOST SUITABLE

[Captioner] 21:36:32
 WAS 
ACTUALLY DEEMED NOT SUITABLE 
BECAUSE IT WASN'T NEAR ANY 


[Captioner] 21:36:36
SERVICES.
ANY TRANSPORTATION, GROCERY 
STORES, THINGS OF THAT NATURE

[Captioner] 21:36:40
.
AND SO THAT WAS RULED OUT, THAT 
WOULD HAVE BEEN THE LARGE

[Captioner] 21:36:46
EST 
PROPERTY THAT WE COULD HAVE, YOU 
KNOW, THAT

[Captioner] 21:36:49
 WE FOUND.
>> Councilmember Salwan:   GOT 
IT.


[Captioner] 21:36:53
SO ANY FEEDBACK WE GIVE TODAY, 
WOULD THAT COME AFTER THE 
HOMELESS

[Captioner] 21:36:57
 PLAN OR WOULD YOU BE 
ABLE TO GET IT AT THE SAME TIME, 
OR HOW WOULD THAT

[Captioner] 21:37:01
 WORK?

[Captioner] 21:37:05

>> IT WOULD DEPEND ON THE TYPE 
OF COUNCIL DIRECTION

[Captioner] 21:37:10
.
SO AS RAFAEL NOTED

[Captioner] 21:37:14
, WE HAD 
ORIGINALLY INTENDED TO BRING 
FORWARD THE COMPREHENSIVE

[Captioner] 21:37:18
 
HOMELESSNESS PLAN ALONG WITH, 
YOU KNOW, CONSIDERATION

[Captioner] 21:37:23
 OF 
POTENTIAL ACCOMPANYING 
REGULATION AND IF

[Captioner] 21:37:26
 IT IS 
COUNCIL'S INTENT TO PROVIDE 
ADDITIONAL DIRECTION TONIGHT, 


[Captioner] 21:37:30
WE'LL LIN AND WE'LL DO OUR BEST 
TO RESPOND.
>> Councilmember Salwan:   OKAY, 


[Captioner] 21:37:34
I WOULD BE OPEN TO LOOKING AT 
AREAS AROUND SCHOOLS AND SEE HOW

[Captioner] 21:37:38
 
THEY IMPACT TRAFFIC FLOW 
MOVEMENT AS FAR AS STUDENTS

[Captioner] 21:37:43
 AND 
VEHICLES AND CIRCULATION

[Captioner] 21:37:46
 AROUND 
THOSE AREAS.
AND I WOULD BE OPEN TO LOOKING 


[Captioner] 21:37:50
AT THE OPTIONS, THE PROS, THE 
CONS AND

[Captioner] 21:37:54
 YOU KNOW WHAT THE 
TRADEOFFS ARE AND THE UNINTENDED 
CONSEQUENCE

[Captioner] 21:37:58
S OF COURSE.
BECAUSE SOMETIMES WE MOVE PEOPLE 
FROM ONE

[Captioner] 21:38:02
 AREA AND THEY GO TO THE 
DIFFERENT AREA AND THEN WE HAVE 
TO ADDRESS THE OTHER AREA.

[Captioner] 21:38:05

AND PARKS IS ANOTHER AREA IF WE 
CAN LOOK AROUND THE PARKS AS 


[Captioner] 21:38:10
WELL.
I THINK THOSE

[Captioner] 21:38:14
 ARE WORTH 
EXPLORING AND I'D LOVE TO GIT 
MORE DATA ON THAT AREA

[Captioner] 21:38:18
, WE 
DEFINITELY WANT TO MAKE FREMONT 
A

[Captioner] 21:38:22
 SAFER CITY, MAKE SURE THEY 
FEEL COMFORTABLE WALKING IN 
THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS,

[Captioner] 21:38:25
 THAT WOULD 
BE VERY DESIRED, THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei:   NO THANK YOU, I 


[Captioner] 21:38:30
THINK THAT'S WHY WE HAD THIS 
AGENDA ITEM.
COUNCILMEMBER KENG

[Captioner] 21:38:34
.
>> Councilmember Keng:   YES, 
THANK YOU MAYOR AND THANK YOU 


[Captioner] 21:38:38
VERY MUCH TO THE STAFF TEAM FOR 
YOUR PRESENTATION.
DEFINITELY, WE HAVE

[Captioner] 21:38:42
 A GROWING 
UNHOUSED POPULATION THAT IS 
SIGNIFICANT AND

[Captioner] 21:38:46
 ACTUALLY MORE 
THAN OUR NEIGHBORING CITIES.
AND I ACTUALLY HAVE A

[Captioner] 21:38:50
 QUESTION 
IN REGARDS TO FUNDING.
BECAUSE I KNOW THAT WE'RE 


[Captioner] 21:38:54
STRETCHED VERY THIN TRYING TO 
ADDRESS AND REACHING OUT TO

[Captioner] 21:38:58
 
OTHER RVs OR THE DIFFERENT 
INDIVIDUALS OUT THERE.


[Captioner] 21:39:02
AND BECAUSE OF THE INCREASE 
COUNT,

[Captioner] 21:39:06
 WOULD WE BE ABLE TO, YOU 
KNOW, SECURE AND REACH OUT TO

[Captioner] 21:39:10
 
GET ANY ADDITIONAL FUNDING 
WHETHER IT'S FROM THE COUNTY OR 


[Captioner] 21:39:14
FROM THE STATE?

[Captioner] 21:39:19

>> SO I THINK THE SHORT ANSWER 
IS YES BECAUSE IT CAN ALWAYS 


[Captioner] 21:39:23
DEPEND ON WHAT TYPE OF FUNDING.
BUT THE HAP PROGRAM

[Captioner] 21:39:27
 WHICH IS THE 
HOUSING AND HOMELESS ASSISTANCE 
PROGRAM THAT WAS START

[Captioner] 21:39:31
ED BY THE 
STATE ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO, OUR 
COUNTY FUNDING IS BASED ON

[Captioner] 21:39:35
 POINT 
IN TIME COUNT ALLOCATION.
SO WE

[Captioner] 21:39:40
 ARE ANTICIPATING AS THERE 
IS ANNUAL ALLOTMENTS OF THAT 
FUND

[Captioner] 21:39:44
ING THAT OURS INCREASES WITH 
THE PACE OF OUR INCREASE IN 
HOMELESSNESS.

[Captioner] 21:39:48

BUT THAT IS ONE SOURCE OF 
FUNDING THAT, YOU KNOW, 


[Captioner] 21:39:52
OBVIOUSLY MUCH IS NEEDED BUT 
THAT'S ONE EXAMPLE.
WE DO

[Captioner] 21:39:57
 ACTIVELY MONITOR ANY 
ADDITIONAL FUNDING THAT MAY COME 
UP.

[Captioner] 21:40:01

ONE EXAMPLE IS ENCAMPMENT 
RESOLUTION FUND THAT THE STATE

[Captioner] 21:40:05
 
ALSO ADMINISTERS AND WE ARE 
REVIEWING THAT OPPORTUNITY TO 


[Captioner] 21:40:09
SEE IF THAT APPLIES ANYMORE 

[Captioner] 21:40:14
 ANYWHERE 
WITHIN OUR CITY.
>> Councilmember Keng:  

[Captioner] 21:40:17
 THANK 
YOU VERY MUCH.
WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT IF WE 


[Captioner] 21:40:21
WERE ONLY TRYING TO RESOLVE 
PARKING ISSUES, IF WE ARE MOVING 
THEM

[Captioner] 21:40:25
 FROM ONE PLACE IN THE CITY 
TO ANOTHER, BUT IF WE ARE ABLE 
TO PROVIDE MORE HOUSING

[Captioner] 21:40:29
, 
PERMANENT HOUSING OPTIONS 
BESIDES THE HOUSING NAVIGATION 


[Captioner] 21:40:34
CENTER WHICH SOME INDIVIDUALS 
DON'T PREFER BECAUSE THEY DON'T 
HAVE THEIR PRIVATE SPACE

[Captioner] 21:40:38
S, I 
THINK WE'RE LOOKING AT OTHER 
OPTIONS

[Captioner] 21:40:43
, SOME OF WHICH WE'LL BE 
CONSIDERING PRETTY SOON AND

[Captioner] 21:40:47
 THAT 
WOULD GIVE PEOPLE, YOU KNOW, A 
KIND OF A MORE FEASIBLE

[Captioner] 21:40:51
 HOUSING 
SITUATION OR OPTIONS THAT MORE 
PEOPLE ARE LIKELY TO MOVE INTO

[Captioner] 21:40:55
 
AND TO, YOU KNOW, NOT HAVING TO 
LIVE IN THEIR CARS OR

[Captioner] 21:40:59
 RVs.
SO I THINK THAT THOSE WILL BE -- 
I WOULD LOVE TO

[Captioner] 21:41:03
 SEE MORE KIND OF 
EXPLORING MORE

[Captioner] 21:41:08
 OF THOSE OPTIONS.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 21:41:13
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.
NEXT IS COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN

[Captioner] 21:41:17
.
>> Councilmember Kassan:   I 
JUST WANTED TO APOLOGIES,

[Captioner] 21:41:21
 I 
LOOKED AT THE MESSAGE,

[Captioner] 21:41:26
 I 
APOLOGIZE, THAT I BLAMED STAFF 
FOR MY MISSTATEMENT.

[Captioner] 21:41:28

THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU, 


[Captioner] 21:41:31
COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL AND THEN 
I'D LIKE TO SEE US MAKE SOME 
RECOMMENDATIONS.


[Captioner] 21:41:35
>> Councilmember Campbell:   
OKAY I JUST WANTED TO JUST 
CONTINUE TO SUPPORT ANY EFFORTS 


[Captioner] 21:41:40
THAT WE HAVE AROUND SCHOOLS AND 
LINE OF SIGHT

[Captioner] 21:41:44
 AND CODE 
ENFORCEMENT FOR THE GUIDELINES 
THAT WE

[Captioner] 21:41:48
 HAVE AND THAT KIND OF 
STUFFER.
I THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE 


[Captioner] 21:41:52
IMPORTANT FOR US TO CONTINUE TO 
KEEP OUR PULSE ON

[Captioner] 21:41:56
 HOW WE'RE 
DOING IN THOSE AREAS.
I ALSO LOVE TO

[Captioner] 21:42:00
, LIKE 
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN SAID, GET 
SOME STATS ON

[Captioner] 21:42:05
, ACTIVITY THAT'S 
GOING ON IN THAT AREA AS WELL.
AND I REALLY WANT TO THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 21:42:09

I KNOW YOU GUYS THIS IS A TOUGH, 
TOUGH ENVIRONMENT THAT WE FOUND

[Captioner] 21:42:13
 
OURSELVES IN.
AND IF ANYBODY IS SENSITIVE TO 


[Captioner] 21:42:17
THE UNSHELTERED IT WOULD BE ME 
BECAUSE I HAVE WITNESSED MY OWN 
SON BEING

[Captioner] 21:42:22
 UNSHELTERED FOR MANY, 
MANY YEARS.
SO I UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT THAT

[Captioner] 21:42:26
 
IT HAS ON FAMILIES, ON -- 
BECAUSE YOU

[Captioner] 21:42:30
 HAVE TO REMEMBER 
SOMEBODY LOVES THEM EVEN IF 
THEY'RE IN

[Captioner] 21:42:34
 AN RV, IN FRONT OF 
THEIR HOUSE, THERE ARE STILL

[Captioner] 21:42:38
 
LOVED ONES OUT THERE PROBABLY 
THINKING ABOUT THEM AND 


[Captioner] 21:42:42
WONDERING HOW THEY'RE DOING.
SO I APPRECIATE YOUR SENSITIVITY 
AND YOUR KINDNESS AND

[Captioner] 21:42:46
 YOUR 
COMPASSION WITH DEALING WITH 
THIS UNFORTUNATE SITUATION.


[Captioner] 21:42:50
SO THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei:   WELL, THANK YOU

[Captioner] 21:42:53
 
TO ALL THE COUNCILMEMBERS WHO 
HAVE GIVEN THEIR FEEDBACK AS 


[Captioner] 21:42:57
WELL AS THE PUBLIC.
I WOULD LIKE TO PERSONALLY I 
GUESS FROM WHAT

[Captioner] 21:43:01
 I'VE HEARD A 
LITTLE BIT HEARD THIS EVENING 
FROM THE COUNCIL, IS THE 


[Captioner] 21:43:06
INTEREST TO LOOK AT IN 
PARTICULAR SOME ORDINANCE

[Captioner] 21:43:09
 OR 
POSSIBILITIES.
AND THE REASON I WAS HOPING, I 


[Captioner] 21:43:13
KNOW THAT WE ARE DOING THE STUDY 
RIGHT NOW BOTH WITH THE HOMELESS

[Captioner] 21:43:16

HOMELESSNESS MANAGEMENT PLAN AS 
WELL AS THE ACTIVE 


[Captioner] 21:43:21
TRANSPORTATION PLAN WHICH COME 
BACK IN SPRING.
BUT AS THIS IS HITTING

[Captioner] 21:43:25
 A SEASON 
WHERE WE HAVE BEEN TRYING TO 
ADDRESS THIS I'D LIKE TO EXPLORE 


[Captioner] 21:43:29
SOME OF THE LEGISLATION, I THINK 
THAT IS WHAT WE'RE HEARING FROM 
THE COUNCIL THE MAJORITY

[Captioner] 21:43:32
, IS 
REGARDING ENFORCEMENT IN 
PARTICULAR.


[Captioner] 21:43:36
AND RESTRICTING OF PARKING NOT 
JUST FOR RVs BUT BASICALLY

[Captioner] 21:43:41
 ON 
SOME OF THE SITES.
I'VE ALSO MENTIONED I'VE HAD

[Captioner] 21:43:44
 
INTEREST I'VE HEARD FROM SOME 
PEOPLE WHEN WE HAD THE JOINT 


[Captioner] 21:43:49
SCHOOL CITY SITUATION HAVING 
SAFE

[Captioner] 21:43:53
 ROUTES TO SCHOOL, PUTTING 
MORE BIKE OPPORTUNITIES THERE 
AND I'LL LEAVE THAT TO

[Captioner] 21:43:58
 PUBLIC 
WORKS, THOSE ARE TWO AREAS I'D 
LIKE TO LOOK AT.

[Captioner] 21:44:03

WE TALK ABOUT THE HAP FUNDING 
AND I'D LIKE TO

[Captioner] 21:44:07
 THANK LAURIE AND 
THE TEAM FROM HUMAN SERVICES 
DEPARTMENT IN PARTICIPATE

[Captioner] 21:44:11
ING IN A 
REGULAR MAYORS DISCUSSION AT OUR 
MEETINGS,

[Captioner] 21:44:14
 IT IS BASICALLY A WORK 
GROUP OF THE DIFFERENT CITIES 
WITHIN THAT.


[Captioner] 21:44:18
I KNOW THAT THERE WAS COUNTY 
FUNDING THAT WAS ORIGINALLY FOR 
HOME

[Captioner] 21:44:23
LESSNESS WHICH WE HAVE 
APPLIED AND USED, AS WELL AS 
RECENTLY THERE

[Captioner] 21:44:27
 WAS HOMEKEY 
FUNDING, UNFORTUNATELY WE WERE

[Captioner] 21:44:31
 
BYPASSED AND WE WERE APPEALING 
THAT,

[Captioner] 21:44:35
 THAT WAS MANY SIGNIFICANT 
UNITS OF HOUSING

[Captioner] 21:44:39
, THAT IS 
SOMETHING WE HAVE APPLIED FOR 
NOW THREE TIMES AND I'M VERY

[Captioner] 21:44:42
 
FRUSTRATE THEY'D WE HAVEN'T BEEN 
ABLE TO SECURE THAT.


[Captioner] 21:44:46
BECAUSE THAT WAS HUNDRED -- 
TRYING TO REMEMBER OFF THE TOP 
OF MY HEAD

[Captioner] 21:44:51
, 156 UNITS, THAT 
WOULD MAKE A TREMENDOUS 
DIFFERENT.


[Captioner] 21:44:55
I ALSO WANTED US TO CONTINUE TO 
APPEAL, WE TALKED ABOUT FUND

[Captioner] 21:44:59
ING, 
EACH SUPERVISOR ON THE BOARD HAS 
DISCRETIONARY FUNDING

[Captioner] 21:45:03
 TOO THAT 
CAN BE ALLOCATED AND I KNOW THAT 
SOME PROJECTS HAVE BEEN FUNDED 


[Captioner] 21:45:08
IN OTHER CITIES.
AND FOR US BEING THAT WE'VE SEEN 
A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF GROWTH,

[Captioner] 21:45:12
 I 
HOPE THAT WE CAN AND I KNOW THAT 
WE ARE HAVING SOME CONVERSATION 


[Captioner] 21:45:16
WITH OUR SUPERVISORS TO LOOK AT 
HOW WE CAN ADDRESS THIS.
BECAUSE THIS POINT IN

[Captioner] 21:45:20
 TIME COUNT 
HAS BEEN FRUSTRATING TO SEE THE 
GROWTH AND IN PARTICULAR WE HAVE

[Captioner] 21:45:23
 
SOME UNIQUE CHALLENGES THAT 
PERTAIN TO RV.


[Captioner] 21:45:27
AND SO I THINK THAT FROM THE 
DIRECTION AND I WOULD LOVE -- I 
DON'T KNOW IF WE NEED

[Captioner] 21:45:31
 TO HAVE A 
VOTE OR ANY OTHER FEEDBACK BUT 
I'D LIKE TO PURSUE THIS

[Captioner] 21:45:36
 SOONER 
VERSUS LATER AND FINALLY BECAUSE 
OF THE SAFETY IN TERMS OF THE

[Captioner] 21:45:40
 
FIRES OR DRUG USE, I KNOW THAT 
CHIEF AND THE TEAM I KNOW THAT

[Captioner] 21:45:44
 
YOU'VE BEEN HAVING COMMUNITY 
DISCUSSIONS AND I APPRECIATE

[Captioner] 21:45:49
 THE 
OUTREACH AND WE WANT THE 
COMMUNITY TO FEEL SAFE AND THE

[Captioner] 21:45:52
 
STUDENTS TO FEEL SAFE AND THE 
COMMUNITY MEMBERS.


[Captioner] 21:45:56
I APPRECIATE YOU'RE WORKING IN 
CONCERT WITH OUR SCHOOL 
DISTRICT, WITH OUR YOUTH AND THE

[Captioner] 21:46:00
 
OUTREACH TO THE COMMUNITY.
SO I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SAY THAT 


[Captioner] 21:46:04
I THINK THAT'S THE DIRECTION 
I'VE HEARD FROM THE COUNCIL FOR 
THIS EVENING.


[Captioner] 21:46:08
I AM NOT AGAINST THE IDEA ALSO I 
KNOW COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN HAD 
MENTIONED

[Captioner] 21:46:12
 ABOUT LOOKING AT SITES 
FOR SAFE PARKING.
THAT'S SOMETHING

[Captioner] 21:46:15
 THAT I'M 
SUPPORTIVE.
I DO RECALL THE CONVERSATION AT 


[Captioner] 21:46:19
THE TIME, THE LARGEST SITE THAT 
WE LOOKED AT UNFORTUNATELY

[Captioner] 21:46:23
 IS 
SIGNIFICANTLY WAY FROM ALL 
SERVICES AND PUBLIC 


[Captioner] 21:46:27
TRANSPORTATION.
WHICH MEANS IT WOULD BE GREAT WE 
PUT THEM THERE BUT THERE IS NO

[Captioner] 21:46:30
 
ACCESS THAT THEY NEED TO GET OUT 
OF HOMELESSNESS.


[Captioner] 21:46:34
SO WE ARE LOOKING FOR A SITE OR 
POSSIBILITIES FOR GETTING OUT OF 
THERE

[Captioner] 21:46:39
.
THAT IS POSSIBILITY FOR THE 
HOMEKEY PROGRAM, BUT

[Captioner] 21:46:43
 IN THE 
INTERIM WE ARE LOOKING AT 
FESTIVAL SCHOOLS, SAFE PARKING 


[Captioner] 21:46:47
AND AS WE LOOK AT THE PARKS, 
SOME OF THESE PARKS AS WE

[Captioner] 21:46:52
 ARE 
IMPLEMENTING THESE PLANS.
IS THERE ANY CLARIFICATION YOU

[Captioner] 21:46:56
 
NEED CITY MANAGER?
>> Karena Shackelford:   NO, I 


[Captioner] 21:47:01
THINK THAT IS CLEAR, THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei:   OBVIOUSLY THIS 
IS NOT A FIRM ACTION

[Captioner] 21:47:04
 OTHER THAN 
DIRECTION, IS THERE SOME 
DISCUSSION?


[Captioner] 21:47:08
AND THEN I WISH THAT WE HAD A 
MAGIC WAND AND WE COULD WAVE

[Captioner] 21:47:14
 OUR 
WAND AND THINKS WOULD HAPPEN, WE 
DIDN'T BECOME EMPOWERED

[Captioner] 21:47:17
 WITH 
SUPERPOWERS.
THAT WE SEE THE DIRECTION OF THE 


[Captioner] 21:47:21
NEXT STEPS IN TERMS OF WHAT WE 
WILL SEE?

[Captioner] 21:47:27

>> Karena Shackelford:   I DON'T 
WANT TO PUT STAFF IN A PICKLE

[Captioner] 21:47:32
 
BUT ALLEN YOU CAN TAKE THE 
QUESTION, BUT I THINK WHAT

[Captioner] 21:47:44
STATED OF COURSE, YOU KNOW, WITH 
MORE SIGNAGE OR THINGS OF THAT

[Captioner] 21:47:48
 
NATURE, YOU KNOW, WE HAVE TO 
EVALUATE OUR ABILITY TO ACTUALLY

[Captioner] 21:47:52
 
ENFORCE, SO THAT WHAT WE DO DOES 
ACTUALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE.

[Captioner] 21:47:55

SO LET US PULL THE TEAM 
TOGETHER.


[Captioner] 21:47:59
BUT I DO HEAR LOUD AND CLEAR 
THAT YOU WANT

[Captioner] 21:48:03
 SOMETHING SOONER 
RATHER THAN LATER.
YOU KNOW, YES, WE'LL

[Captioner] 21:48:07
 HAVE THE 
HOMELESS RESPONSE PLAN IN THE 
SPRING BUT

[Captioner] 21:48:11
 WE WILL DEFINITELY 
STRIVE TO DO SOMETHING EVEN 
PRIOR TO

DIRECTION YOU'RE GIVING US 
TONIGHT.

CLARIFY, I WANT TO MAKE SURE 
THAT THE PUBLIC KNOWS

VEHICLES AND

COMPLIANCE WITH THE LEGISLATION 
AND OTHER THINGS THERE IS COST

ALSO TO MAINTAIN THAT.

[Captioner] 21:48:35
 TALKING ABOUT THE 
SHEER NUMBERS AND WHEN WE LOOK 
AT THESE TYPES OF PROCESS

[Captioner] 21:48:39
ES 
ESPECIALLY IF IT IS GOING TO BE 
LEGISLATION AROUND SCHOOLS WE 


[Captioner] 21:48:43
ARE NOT TARGETING ONLY A 
SPECIFIC SCHOOL BUT ENFORCEMENT 
AROUND ALL OUR

[Captioner] 21:48:47
 SCHOOLS.
BECAUSE WE WANT EVERYBODY TO 
HAVE SAFE ROUTES AND

[Captioner] 21:48:51
 SAFE 
ABILITIES TO TRAVEL TO AND FROM 
SCHOOLS.


[Captioner] 21:48:55

BIT OF A DAUNTING TASK BUT WE 
WANT TO MAKE

SOMETHING WE'RE LOOKING AT.
