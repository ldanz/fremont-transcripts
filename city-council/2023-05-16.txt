CITY CLERK.


[Captioner] 19:05:54
ARE THERE SPEAKERS THIS EVENING


[Captioner] 19:05:57
FOR ORAL COMMUNICATIONS?


[Captioner] 19:05:58
>> Ms. Gauthier: WE HAVE TWO


[Captioner] 19:05:58
SPEAKERS IN PERSON.


[Captioner] 19:06:02
THE FIRST SPEAKER IS STEWART 


[Captioner] 19:06:02
RUPP.


[Captioner] 19:06:03
>> Mayor Mei: WELCOME.


[Captioner] 19:06:09
>> GOOD EVENING.


[Captioner] 19:06:11
MY NAME IS STEWART RUPP.


[Captioner] 19:06:14
I FIRST MOVED TO FREMONT IN


[Captioner] 19:06:14
1985.


[Captioner] 19:06:17
AND I'VE SEEN A LOT OF CHANGES


[Captioner] 19:06:18
IN THE PASSING OF TIME.


[Captioner] 19:06:20
MOST FOR THE GOOD, BUT NOT ALL.


[Captioner] 19:06:22
AND THAT'S WHAT I'D LIKE TO TALK


[Captioner] 19:06:24
TO YOU ABOUT TONIGHT.


[Captioner] 19:06:26
I'M TIMING MY PRESENTATION SO I


[Captioner] 19:06:26
DON'T GO ON.


[Captioner] 19:06:28
RED LIGHT CAMERAS.


[Captioner] 19:06:34
THEY ARE VERY CONTROVERSIAL, AND


[Captioner] 19:06:38
I FEEL VERY UNFAIR TO THE


[Captioner] 19:06:39
RESIDENTS AND VISITORS OF THE


[Captioner] 19:06:39
CITY OF FREMONT.


[Captioner] 19:06:44
A FRIEND OF MINE GOT A RED LIGHT


[Captioner] 19:06:45
TICKET AT THE INTERSECTION OF


[Captioner] 19:06:46
AUTOMALL AND CHRISTY.


[Captioner] 19:06:49
AND IT WAS A CAMERA TICKET, AND


[Captioner] 19:06:51
SHE CLAIMED THAT SHE COULDN'T


[Captioner] 19:06:54
POSSIBLY STOP IN THAT SHORT A


[Captioner] 19:06:56
PERIOD WITHOUT SLAMMING ON THE


[Captioner] 19:06:57
BRAKES AND RISKING A REAR-END


[Captioner] 19:06:58
COLLISION WITH THE PERSON BEHIND


[Captioner] 19:06:58
HER.


[Captioner] 19:07:02
AND I SAID I'D LOOK INTO IT.


[Captioner] 19:07:03
SO I WENT TO THAT INTERSECTION,


[Captioner] 19:07:08
AND I TIMED WITH MY IPHONE 10


[Captioner] 19:07:10
RED LIGHT, YELLOW LIGHT


[Captioner] 19:07:10
INTERVALS.


[Captioner] 19:07:13
AND THE AVERAGE OF 10 READINGS


[Captioner] 19:07:13
WAS 3.8 SECONDS.


[Captioner] 19:07:18
AND LAST WEEK I WENT TO THE CITY


[Captioner] 19:07:20
TRANSPORTATION SECTION OFFICE,


[Captioner] 19:07:22
AND ASKED, WHAT IS IT SUPPOSED


[Captioner] 19:07:23
TO BE SET AT?


[Captioner] 19:07:24
THEY SAID 4.0 SECONDS.


[Captioner] 19:07:26
SO THERE'S A DISCREPANCY THERE.


[Captioner] 19:07:30
NOW, THE MINIMUM -- MINIMUM, NOT


[Captioner] 19:07:33
THE ACTUAL BUT THE MINIMUM


[Captioner] 19:07:35
YELLOW INTERVAL TIME IS


[Captioner] 19:07:36
DETERMINED BY THE CALIFORNIA


[Captioner] 19:07:38
MANUAL OF UNIFORM TRAFFIC


[Captioner] 19:07:38
CONTROL DEVICES.


[Captioner] 19:07:42
AND BEST ENGINEERING PRACTICES.


[Captioner] 19:07:45
IT'S MY OPINION THE FREMONT


[Captioner] 19:07:47
TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING


[Captioner] 19:07:48
SECTION HAS BIASED ALL THEIR


[Captioner] 19:07:50
ENGINEERING DECISIONS TOWARDS


[Captioner] 19:07:52
SHORTENING THE DURATION OF THE


[Captioner] 19:07:54
YELLOW LIGHTS, THUS INCREASING


[Captioner] 19:07:54
THE NUMBER OF CITATIONS.


[Captioner] 19:07:58
FOR EXAMPLE, THE INSTITUTE OF


[Captioner] 19:08:03
TRAFFIC ENGINEERS' CONTROL


[Captioner] 19:08:05
DEVICE MANUAL SAYS THE AVERAGE


[Captioner] 19:08:06
DRIVER COULD DECELERATE AT A


[Captioner] 19:08:08
RATE OF 15 FEET PER SECOND.


[Captioner] 19:08:12
AND A GOOD DRIVER, THEY CALL A


[Captioner] 19:08:14
SKILLED DRIVER, CAN STOP IN A


[Captioner] 19:08:15
MUCH SHORTER DISTANCE.


[Captioner] 19:08:16
ACCORDING TO THE HANDBOOK, IT


[Captioner] 19:08:18
TAKES THE AVERAGE DRIVER GOING


[Captioner] 19:08:23
35 MILES AN HOUR 4.42 SECONDS TO


[Captioner] 19:08:23
STOP.


[Captioner] 19:08:26
THE CITY HAS CHOSEN TO


[Captioner] 19:08:28
CHARACTERIZE ALL DRIVERS AS VERY


[Captioner] 19:08:30
SKILLED WHEN SETTING THE YELLOW


[Captioner] 19:08:30
LIGHT INTERVALS.


[Captioner] 19:08:34
HOWEVER, THE DMV ISSUES DRIVER'S


[Captioner] 19:08:36
LICENSE TO LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF


[Captioner] 19:08:38
AVERAGE DRIVERS EVERY DAY.


[Captioner] 19:08:41
SO TO CHARACTERIZE ALL DRIVERS


[Captioner] 19:08:43
AS SKILLED DOESN'T MAKE A LOT OF


[Captioner] 19:08:43
SENSE.


[Captioner] 19:08:48
THE CALIFORNIA MANUAL FOR


[Captioner] 19:08:49
UNIFORM TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES


[Captioner] 19:08:50
HAS TWO TABLES FOR DETERMINING


[Captioner] 19:08:51
YELLOW LIGHT INTERVALS.


[Captioner] 19:08:55
ONE IS BASED ON THE AVERAGE


[Captioner] 19:08:56
SPEED ON THAT SECTION OF ROAD.


[Captioner] 19:09:00
THE OTHER IS BASED ON THE POSTED


[Captioner] 19:09:01
SPEED LIMIT.


[Captioner] 19:09:05
USING THE 85 PERCENTILE CHART,


[Captioner] 19:09:09
THE MINIMUM -- MINIMUM, I


[Captioner] 19:09:13
EMPHASIZE MINIMUM, IS


[Captioner] 19:09:13
3.9 SECONDS -- WHAT IS THAT?


[Captioner] 19:09:14
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:09:16
IT'S A TIME -- 3 MINUTES.


[Captioner] 19:09:19
YES.


[Captioner] 19:09:21
THAT WAS 3 MINUTES, SIR.


[Captioner] 19:09:25
THAT WAS ACTUALLY COUNTED DOWN


[Captioner] 19:09:27
ON THE CLOCK SO -- BUT YOU'RE


[Captioner] 19:09:29
WELCOME TO SUBMIT YOUR


[Captioner] 19:09:29
INFORMATION TO US.


[Captioner] 19:09:33
THAT IS THE 3-MINUTE TIME FRAME,


[Captioner] 19:09:33
SIR.


[Captioner] 19:09:42
[SPEAKER OFF MIC]


[Captioner] 19:09:58
>> Mayor Mei: I'M SORRY TO


[Captioner] 19:10:00
HEAR THAT BUT WE WANT TO BE


[Captioner] 19:10:01
CONSISTENT WITH ALL THE OTHER


[Captioner] 19:10:01
SPEAKERS.


[Captioner] 19:10:03
>> Ms. Gauthier: THE NEXT


[Captioner] 19:10:03
SPEAKER --


[Captioner] 19:10:04
>> Mayor Mei: YOU CAN ALSO


[Captioner] 19:10:05
GIVE THE INFORMATION TO OUR


[Captioner] 19:10:06
PUBLIC WORKS DIRECTOR, WHO CAN


[Captioner] 19:10:06
GET THAT FROM YOU.


[Captioner] 19:10:09
BUT THE NEXT SPEAKER, PLEASE?


[Captioner] 19:10:10
>> Ms. Gauthier: THE NEXT


[Captioner] 19:10:15
SPEAKER IS DANIEL CARPELOVIHCH.


[Captioner] 19:10:18
>> Mayor Mei: JUST A REMINDER,


[Captioner] 19:10:20
WE HAVE 3 MINUTES FOR EVERY


[Captioner] 19:10:22
SPEAKER TO BE CONSISTENT.


[Captioner] 19:10:24
>> IS THIS THING ON?


[Captioner] 19:10:25
>> Mayor Mei: YES, IT IS.


[Captioner] 19:10:29
>> MY NAME IS DANIEL, RESIDENT


[Captioner] 19:10:31
IN THE BROOKVALE NEIGHBORHOOD


[Captioner] 19:10:31
NEAR AMERICAN HIGH SCHOOL.


[Captioner] 19:10:35
I WANTED TO BRING TO THE COUNCIL


[Captioner] 19:10:37
AND STAFF'S ATTENTION THE


[Captioner] 19:10:40
SECTION OF NICOLET DRIVE BETWEEN


[Captioner] 19:10:42
ASHTON PLACE AND ISHERWOOD 


[Captioner] 19:10:42
DRIVE.


[Captioner] 19:10:44
ON THE WAY TO THE CITY COUNCIL


[Captioner] 19:10:46
MEETING TODAY, I TOOK OUT MY


[Captioner] 19:10:49
TAPE MEASURE AND MEASURE THE


[Captioner] 19:10:50
LANE WIDTHS.


[Captioner] 19:10:52
THE LANE WIDTHS ARE ABOUT


[Captioner] 19:10:53
15 FEET.


[Captioner] 19:10:54
THAT IS HIGHWAY LANE WIDTH.


[Captioner] 19:10:55
IF NOT WIDER.


[Captioner] 19:11:00
OSTENSIBLY THERE IS PARKING


[Captioner] 19:11:02
ALLOWED ON THAT ROAD.


[Captioner] 19:11:04
I HAVE NEVER SEEN A PARKED CAR


[Captioner] 19:11:05
THERE.


[Captioner] 19:11:06
I'M SERIOUS, NEVER.


[Captioner] 19:11:08
THERE'S NEVER BEEN A CAR PARKED


[Captioner] 19:11:14
IN THAT AREA OF NICOLET DRIVE.


[Captioner] 19:11:16
THERE'S NO HOUSES FACING


[Captioner] 19:11:17
NICOLET.


[Captioner] 19:11:20
THEY'RE ALL FACING THE ADJOINING


[Captioner] 19:11:20
ROADS.


[Captioner] 19:11:26
AND IT JUST ENCOURAGES HIGH


[Captioner] 19:11:26
SPEEDS.


[Captioner] 19:11:28
THERE ARE STOP SIGNS THERE BUT


[Captioner] 19:11:30
WE ALL KNOW STOP SIGNS ARE NOT


[Captioner] 19:11:33
TRAFFIC-CALMING MEASURES, SO I


[Captioner] 19:11:36
ASK THAT THE CITY COUNCIL LOOK


[Captioner] 19:11:42
INTO ADDING BULBOUTS NARROWING


[Captioner] 19:11:44
THOSE LANES, POTENTIALLY ADDING


[Captioner] 19:11:45
BIKE LANES OR TREES TO NARROW


[Captioner] 19:11:47
THE LANES AND SLOW DOWN TRAFFIC,


[Captioner] 19:11:49
AND CONSIDER REMOVING THE STOP


[Captioner] 19:11:49
SIGNS.


[Captioner] 19:11:52
SOME OF THE STOP SIGNS, ONE IN


[Captioner] 19:11:55
PARTICULAR, IS FOR A T


[Captioner] 19:11:56
INTERSECTION FOR A CUL DE SAC


[Captioner] 19:11:57
THAT HAS 7 HOUSES ON IT.


[Captioner] 19:12:00
SO I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHY A


[Captioner] 19:12:00
TINY INTERSECTION LIKE THAT


[Captioner] 19:12:01
NEEDS A STOP SIGN.


[Captioner] 19:12:03
THERE ARE MUCH BETTER


[Captioner] 19:12:04
TRAFFIC-CALMING MEASURES THAT


[Captioner] 19:12:06
WOULD BE MORE EFFICIENT FOR


[Captioner] 19:12:08
CARS, BE MORE EFFICIENT FOR


[Captioner] 19:12:10
PEDESTRIANS, AND PERHAPS EVEN BE


[Captioner] 19:12:12
SAFER BECAUSE I DO NOT KNOW THE


[Captioner] 19:12:14
NUMBER OF TIMES I'VE SEEN A CAR


[Captioner] 19:12:16
BLOW THROUGH THOSE STOP SIGNS


[Captioner] 19:12:18
BECAUSE THERE'S FIVE TO SIX STOP


[Captioner] 19:12:20
SIGNS ON THAT SEGMENT, AND THERE


[Captioner] 19:12:23
ARE NO LARGE INTERSECTIONS, NO


[Captioner] 19:12:25
MAJOR CROSS TRAFFIC, SO REALLY


[Captioner] 19:12:28
IT'S AN INEFFICIENT USE OF 


[Captioner] 19:12:30
SPACE, THERE'S OVER 30 FEET OF


[Captioner] 19:12:32
TOTAL RIGHT-OF-WAY ON THAT


[Captioner] 19:12:32
ROAD.


[Captioner] 19:12:35
WE DO NOT NEED 15-FOOT WIDE


[Captioner] 19:12:40
LANES ON A MINOR NEIGHBORHOOD


[Captioner] 19:12:40
STREET.


[Captioner] 19:12:41
I HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF TIME


[Captioner] 19:12:42
LEFT.


[Captioner] 19:12:45
SO REALLY, I THINK THERE COULD


[Captioner] 19:12:46
BE EITHER A BIKE LANE THERE OR


[Captioner] 19:12:48
ONE OF THOSE PARKING LANES COULD


[Captioner] 19:12:50
BE REMOVED, SO REALLY LIKE


[Captioner] 19:12:51
THERE'S ZERO PARKING UTILIZATION


[Captioner] 19:12:51
THERE.


[Captioner] 19:12:54
WE COULD REALLY REMOVE HALF OF


[Captioner] 19:12:56
THAT, JUST TAKE ONE SIDE OF THE


[Captioner] 19:12:57
STREET, HAVE NO PARKING THERE,


[Captioner] 19:12:59
AND THEN DO SO MUCH MORE WITH


[Captioner] 19:12:59
THAT SPACE.


[Captioner] 19:13:01
WE COULD PLANT SOME TREES


[Captioner] 19:13:01
THERE.


[Captioner] 19:13:04
WE COULD PUT SOME PARK BENCHES,


[Captioner] 19:13:06
WE COULD MAKE A SIDEWALK THAT IS


[Captioner] 19:13:07
ACTUALLY LARGE ENOUGH.


[Captioner] 19:13:10
TONS OF THINGS WE COULD DO THAT


[Captioner] 19:13:11
AREN'T JUST HAVING PARKING.


[Captioner] 19:13:15
I OBVIOUSLY KNOW THAT THERE IS


[Captioner] 19:13:17
THE ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION PLAN


[Captioner] 19:13:19
THAT IS COMING UP IN THE NEXT


[Captioner] 19:13:20
COUPLE MONTHS, IN THE NEXT YEAR


[Captioner] 19:13:24
OR SO, BUT REALLY WE COULD DO


[Captioner] 19:13:26
SOMETHING FASTER THAN DOING


[Captioner] 19:13:26
THAT.


[Captioner] 19:13:26
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:13:27
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:13:31
>> Ms. Gauthier: WE HAVE A


[Captioner] 19:13:32
SPEAK ARE ON ZOOM.


[Captioner] 19:13:32
KELLY.


[Captioner] 19:13:34
>> Mayor Mei: WELCOME, KELLY.


[Captioner] 19:13:34
>> THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:13:39
>> Ms. Gauthier: AND


[Captioner] 19:13:39
MR. HINTS.


[Captioner] 19:13:42
>> SO THE GENTLEMAN BEFORE


[Captioner] 19:13:43
TALKING ABOUT THE TIMING OF THE


[Captioner] 19:13:45
RED LIGHT CAMERAS AND THE YELLOW


[Captioner] 19:13:48
LIGHT TIMING, HE MAY NOT BE


[Captioner] 19:13:50
AWARE, PROBABLY HASN'T BEEN


[Captioner] 19:13:51
READING THE NEWSPAPER, BUT ABOUT


[Captioner] 19:13:53
FIVE YEARS AGO, THIS SAME THING,


[Captioner] 19:13:55
THIS SAME QUESTION ABOUT YELLOW


[Captioner] 19:13:57
LIGHT TIMING CAME UP AND IT WAS


[Captioner] 19:14:00
WELL RESEARCHED IN THE


[Captioner] 19:14:02
NEWSPAPER, WHERE THE YELLOW


[Captioner] 19:14:05
LIGHT TIMINGS WERE OFF


[Captioner] 19:14:06
SIGNIFICANTLY, NOT 0.2 SECONDS,


[Captioner] 19:14:09
THEY WERE OFF BY A LOT, HALF A


[Captioner] 19:14:10
SECOND, 0.7 SECONDS, SOMETHING


[Captioner] 19:14:15
LIKE THAT, AND YOU KNOW, JUST


[Captioner] 19:14:17
BECAUSE THE INSTITUTE OF TRAFFIC


[Captioner] 19:14:19
ENGINEERS SAYS WHATEVER, YOU


[Captioner] 19:14:20
KNOW, THE CITY HAS A LOT OF --


[Captioner] 19:14:25
IS VERY CAPABLE OF IGNORING


[Captioner] 19:14:26
THESE KIND OF COMPLAINTS, AND


[Captioner] 19:14:28
FOR EXAMPLE, THAT TIME, THEY


[Captioner] 19:14:30
JUST BLAMED THE TRAFFIC INTERN.


[Captioner] 19:14:33
THE INTERN SET THE TIMINGS


[Captioner] 19:14:33
WRONG.


[Captioner] 19:14:38
AND OF COURSE VERY FEW PEOPLE


[Captioner] 19:14:39
GOT ANY MONEY REFUNDED FROM THE


[Captioner] 19:14:44
 MISTAKE, AND THEY RAN


[Captioner] 19:14:45
THAT MISTAKEN TIMING FOR


[Captioner] 19:14:47
7 MONTHS AND ONLY GAVE BACK


[Captioner] 19:14:50
ABOUT 2 MONTHS WORTH OF TRAFFIC


[Captioner] 19:14:53
FINES AND THEY DIDN'T GIVE BACK


[Captioner] 19:14:55
THE WHOLE FINE, THEY OANL GAVE


[Captioner] 19:14:56
BACK ONE-THIRD OF EACH FINE


[Captioner] 19:14:58
BECAUSE THE REST WAS NOT TAKEN


[Captioner] 19:14:58
UP BY THE CITY.


[Captioner] 19:15:00
THAT PARTICULAR PLACE OUT THERE


[Captioner] 19:15:05
NEAR COSTCO AND AUTOMALL IS ONE


[Captioner] 19:15:07
OF THE MOST PROFITABLE


[Captioner] 19:15:09
INTERSECTIONS FOR THE CITY


[Captioner] 19:15:10
BECAUSE THE CITY JUST PUT IN


[Captioner] 19:15:11
THOSE RED LIGHT CAMERAS ABOUT


[Captioner] 19:15:14
TWO YEARS AGO, AND BY DOING SO,


[Captioner] 19:15:17
JUST TWO EXTRA RED LIGHT CAMERAS


[Captioner] 19:15:18
NEARLY DOUBLED THE TOTAL AMOUNT


[Captioner] 19:15:21
OF RED LIGHT CAMERAS BEING


[Captioner] 19:15:24
ISSUED IN THE CITY, AND EACH --


[Captioner] 19:15:26
THE FACE VALUE OF THESE FINES IS


[Captioner] 19:15:28
$490, AND THE CITY IS ONLY


[Captioner] 19:15:31
GETTING OUT THERE AT COSTCO, AT


[Captioner] 19:15:33
PACIFIC COMMONS, THE CITY ONLY


[Captioner] 19:15:37
GETS ABOUT 55 -- $50 PER


[Captioner] 19:15:37
TICKET.


[Captioner] 19:15:40
THE REST OF THE MONEY, YOU KNOW,


[Captioner] 19:15:42
GOES TO OTHER PLACES, AND SOME


[Captioner] 19:15:47
OF IT ISN'T EVEN PAID BY THE


[Captioner] 19:15:48
PEOPLE, AND A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE


[Captioner] 19:15:50
APPEALING THESE FINES, SO ONE


[Captioner] 19:15:52
THING YOU MIGHT CONSIDER DOING


[Captioner] 19:15:53
IS APPEALING YOUR FINE.


[Captioner] 19:15:57
AND THEN ALSO SIMILAR THING


[Captioner] 19:15:59
HAPPENING AT MISSION PEAK, WHERE


[Captioner] 19:16:02
THE CITY HAS PUT IN PARKING


[Captioner] 19:16:04
TICKETS AT MISSION PEAK, BUT


[Captioner] 19:16:08
THEY SLIPPED IT IN A PARKING


[Captioner] 19:16:09
TICKET FEE INCREASE, SO INSTEAD


[Captioner] 19:16:13
OF PAYING THE STANDARD $75, THE


[Captioner] 19:16:16
CITY STAFF SECRETLY RAISED THE


[Captioner] 19:16:18
RATES WITHOUT TELLING THE CITY


[Captioner] 19:16:20
COUNCIL, RAISED THE RATE


[Captioner] 19:16:23
UP TO $82 OF FINE AMOUNT, AND,


[Captioner] 19:16:25
YOU KNOW, PUT IT IN THE FINE


[Captioner] 19:16:28
PRINT AND RAN IT THROUGH.


[Captioner] 19:16:30
SO THIS KIND OF STUFF, OF COURSE


[Captioner] 19:16:31
THERE'S NO -- WHEN YOU DO IT


[Captioner] 19:16:33
THAT WAY, YOU DON'T HAVE TO


[Captioner] 19:16:34
EXPLAIN WHY BECAUSE NOBODY'S


[Captioner] 19:16:35
ASKING YOU WHY.


[Captioner] 19:16:35
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:16:44
>> Ms. Gauthier: THE NEXT


[Captioner] 19:16:44
SPEAKER IS JOHN HINDS.


[Captioner] 19:16:52
>> CAN YOU HEAR ME THIS TIME?


[Captioner] 19:16:54
>> Ms. Gauthier: YES.


[Captioner] 19:16:54
>> COOL.


[Captioner] 19:16:56
HELLO, EVERYONE.


[Captioner] 19:16:57
THIS ONE IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT.


[Captioner] 19:17:00
LAST MONTH, A COUNCIL MEETING


[Captioner] 19:17:01
GOT CANCELED.


[Captioner] 19:17:03
NO PROBLEM THERE.


[Captioner] 19:17:06
IN FACT, IT SUGGESTS AN


[Captioner] 19:17:06
INTERESTING OPPORTUNITY.


[Captioner] 19:17:09
WHAT IF FOR SOME FUTURE MEETING,


[Captioner] 19:17:11
WE SENT OUT THE AGENDA PACKAGE


[Captioner] 19:17:13
AS USUAL AND THEN CANCELED THE


[Captioner] 19:17:13
MEETING?


[Captioner] 19:17:16
OR RATHER RESCHEDULED IT UNTIL


[Captioner] 19:17:18
THE NEXT AVAILABLE TUESDAY, AND


[Captioner] 19:17:20
THEN STUCK TO THAT AS THE NEW


[Captioner] 19:17:20
SCHEDULE.


[Captioner] 19:17:23
THAT IS, THE AGENDA PACKAGE WAS


[Captioner] 19:17:25
CONTINUED TO GO OUT ON THE SAME


[Captioner] 19:17:26
TIMING IT ALWAYS HAS BUT THE


[Captioner] 19:17:28
MEETINGS THEMSELVES WOULD ALL BE


[Captioner] 19:17:28
PUSHED OUTWARD.


[Captioner] 19:17:29
ONE WEEK.


[Captioner] 19:17:34
NOW THE MAIN EFFECT OF THAT WAS


[Captioner] 19:17:36
THAT AS PEOPLE GET THIS PACKAGE


[Captioner] 19:17:37
OF IMPORTANT MATERIALS TO READ


[Captioner] 19:17:40
AND CONSIDER CAREFULLY BEFORE


[Captioner] 19:17:42
DELIBERATING AND VOTING, INSTEAD


[Captioner] 19:17:45
OF HAVING JUST FOUR DAYS TO


[Captioner] 19:17:47
DELIBERATE AS THEY DO NOW, THEY


[Captioner] 19:17:48
HAVE 11, WITH THE POTENTIAL


[Captioner] 19:17:50
UPSIDE THAT THE QUALITY OF THE


[Captioner] 19:17:51
MEETINGS COULD BE IMPROVED.


[Captioner] 19:17:52
TWO THINGS TO NOTE ABOUT THIS.


[Captioner] 19:17:55
THE FIRST IS THAT TO IMPLEMENT


[Captioner] 19:17:58
IT WOULD REQUIRE ONLY A SINGLE


[Captioner] 19:17:59
EVENT.


[Captioner] 19:18:01
CANCELING ONE MEETING, LIKE WE


[Captioner] 19:18:02
DID LAST MONTH.


[Captioner] 19:18:03
THE OTHER THING TO NOTE IS THAT


[Captioner] 19:18:06
IT WOULD NOT MEAN ANY NET


[Captioner] 19:18:08
INCREASE OR NET ACCELERATION OF


[Captioner] 19:18:09
STAFF WORKLOAD BECAUSE THEY


[Captioner] 19:18:11
WOULD CONTINUE TO PUT OUT THE


[Captioner] 19:18:14
VERY SAME AGENDA PACKAGE ON THE


[Captioner] 19:18:16
SAME SCHEDULE THEY DO NOW, ONLY


[Captioner] 19:18:17
THE MEETINGS WOULD BE DELAYED.


[Captioner] 19:18:23
NOW I'VE TALKED ABOUT THE


[Captioner] 19:18:23
UPSIDE.


[Captioner] 19:18:25
ARE THERE ANY DOWNSIDES TO


[Captioner] 19:18:25
THIS?


[Captioner] 19:18:26
WHAT IF WE HAD AN EMERGENCY


[Captioner] 19:18:27
ITEM?


[Captioner] 19:18:29
WE HAD ONE OF THOSE ALREADY THIS


[Captioner] 19:18:30
YEAR THAT GOT ADDED TO THE


[Captioner] 19:18:31
AGENDA WITH NO PROBLEMS.


[Captioner] 19:18:32
THAT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE AN


[Captioner] 19:18:32
ISSUE.


[Captioner] 19:18:35
WHAT ABOUT ITEMS THAT ARE UP


[Captioner] 19:18:36
CLOSE TO A FUNDING DEADLINE WITH


[Captioner] 19:18:38
THE STATE OR SOME OTHER GRANTING


[Captioner] 19:18:38
AGENCY?


[Captioner] 19:18:42
IN MY OBSERVATION OVER THE LAST


[Captioner] 19:18:44
FEW YEARS, WE'VE BEEN SEEING


[Captioner] 19:18:46
THOSE AT THE RATE OF ABOUT ONCE


[Captioner] 19:18:47
PER YEAR, NOT VERY OFTEN.


[Captioner] 19:18:51
ALL OF THOSE OTHER AGENDA ITEMS


[Captioner] 19:18:53
DON'T HAVE THAT KIND OF TIME


[Captioner] 19:18:55
PRESSURE, SO THEY WOULD BENEFIT


[Captioner] 19:18:57
FROM GIVING EVERYBODY A LITTLE


[Captioner] 19:18:59
MORE TIME.


[Captioner] 19:19:02
ANYWAY, I THINK IT WOULD BE MORE


[Captioner] 19:19:03
RESPECTFUL OF THE COUNCIL TO


[Captioner] 19:19:04
GIVE THEM THOSE EXTRA FEW DAYS


[Captioner] 19:19:05
NO MATTER WHAT.


[Captioner] 19:19:08
BUT AS FOR THE FEW ITEMS THAT DO


[Captioner] 19:19:11
HAVE A SHORT FUSE, IT WOULD BE A


[Captioner] 19:19:13
LITTLE ODD, REALLY, TO STRUCTURE


[Captioner] 19:19:15
OUR MANAGEMENT PROCESSES AROUND


[Captioner] 19:19:18
A NEED FOR LAST MINUTE


[Captioner] 19:19:18
APPROVALS.


[Captioner] 19:19:19
AND THE FACT THAT WE'VE HAD SO


[Captioner] 19:19:22
FEW LIKE THAT TELLS US THAT WE


[Captioner] 19:19:24
HAVE MANAGED THESE FUNDING


[Captioner] 19:19:25
DEADLINES PRETTY WELL AND THAT


[Captioner] 19:19:26
SHOULD GIVE US SOME CONFIDENCE


[Captioner] 19:19:27
THAT WE COULD MAKE IT WORK.


[Captioner] 19:19:29
SO PLEASE CONSIDER THIS.


[Captioner] 19:19:31
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:19:33
>> Ms. Gauthier: THE NEXT


[Captioner] 19:19:33
SPEAKER IS WENDY.


[Captioner] 19:19:38



[Captioner] 19:19:39
>> Mayor Mei: WELCOME, WENDY.


[Captioner] 19:19:39
THANK YOU, JOHN.


[Captioner] 19:19:46
>> HI, EVERYONE.


[Captioner] 19:19:47
THIS IS WENDY HERE.


[Captioner] 19:19:49
I HAVE A PROPERTY THAT IS ON THE


[Captioner] 19:19:52
LEONARD DEVELOPMENT NEAR WARM


[Captioner] 19:19:54
SPRINGS BART, THE ADDRESS


[Captioner] 19:19:55
ACTUALLY IS ON QUANTUM DRIVE,


[Captioner] 19:19:57
AND RECENTLY THE CITY OF FREMONT


[Captioner] 19:20:02
PLACED A NO PARKING SIGN ON A


[Captioner] 19:20:04
TESLA PRIVATE ROAD SIGN ON OUR


[Captioner] 19:20:05
RESIDENTIAL STREET ON QUANTUM


[Captioner] 19:20:05
DRIVE.


[Captioner] 19:20:09
I FIND THAT THE PRIVATIZATION OF


[Captioner] 19:20:12
PUBLIC RESIDENTIAL STREET IS


[Captioner] 19:20:13
ERRONEOUS AND PROBLEMATIC,


[Captioner] 19:20:15
ESPECIALLY SINCE OUR FRONT DOOR


[Captioner] 19:20:16
TO OUR BUILDING IS ON QUANTUM


[Captioner] 19:20:18
DRIVE AND WE BOUGHT THIS


[Captioner] 19:20:20
PROPERTY WITH THE EXPECTATION OF


[Captioner] 19:20:23
AVAILABLE PUBLIC STREET PARKING


[Captioner] 19:20:24
IN FRONT OF THE BUILDING FOR


[Captioner] 19:20:25
FRIENDS AND FAMILY WHO MAY VISIT


[Captioner] 19:20:27
FROM TIME TO TIME.


[Captioner] 19:20:29
AND THEN THE NO PARKING SIGNS ON


[Captioner] 19:20:31
THE SIDE OF THE STREET CLOSEST


[Captioner] 19:20:34
TO TESLA MAKE


[Captioner] 19:20:35
SENSE BECAUSE THAT IS A DRIVING


[Captioner] 19:20:37
LANE, HOWEVER, THERE IS THE


[Captioner] 19:20:39
PAINTED LINE ON THE RESIDENTIAL


[Captioner] 19:20:40
SIDE OF QUANTUM DRIVE THAT'S


[Captioner] 19:20:42
DIRECTLY PARALLEL TO THE CURB IN


[Captioner] 19:20:44
FRONT OF THEIR BUILDING THAT


[Captioner] 19:20:44
INTERINDICATES PUBLIC STREET


[Captioner] 19:20:44
PARKING.


[Captioner] 19:20:46
SO I WOULD LIKE THE CITY OF


[Captioner] 19:20:50
FREMONT TO REVISIT THE TESLA'S


[Captioner] 19:20:50
APPROVAL.


[Captioner] 19:20:51
THANK YOU FOR EVERYONE'S TIME.


[Captioner] 19:20:57
>> Ms. Gauthier: THAT'S THE


[Captioner] 19:20:57
LAST SPEAKER.


[Captioner] 19:20:59
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:21:01
AND AT THIS TIME, WE'LL RETURN


[Captioner] 19:21:03
TO OUR REGULARLY SCHEDULED ITEMS


[Captioner] 19:21:07

THE NATIONAL ECONOMY, WHILE

[Captioner] 19:23:40
TO SLOW OVER THE NEXT YEAR, OR


[Captioner] 19:23:42
POSSIBLY EVEN DIP INTO A


[Captioner] 19:23:43
RECESSION.


[Captioner] 19:23:46
TO COMBAT INFLATION, THE FEDERAL

HAS RAISED ITS FED FUNDS TARGET


[Captioner] 19:23:50

[Captioner] 19:23:53
OVER THE LAST YEAR.


[Captioner] 19:23:55

[Captioner] 19:24:19
ON THE OTHER HAND, OVER THE LAST

[Captioner] 19:24:36
BUT THAT WOULD INCREASE THE RISK

OF A RECESSION.


[Captioner] 19:24:40
OUR PROPOSED BUDGET FOR 2023/24


[Captioner] 19:24:43
IS BASED ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT


[Captioner] 19:24:44

[Captioner] 19:25:17

[Captioner] 19:26:27
PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC, THE


[Captioner] 19:26:29
CITY'S AVERAGE ANNUAL GROWTH


[Captioner] 19:26:31
RATE FOR SALES TAX REVENUE WAS


[Captioner] 19:26:32
CLOSE TO 10.5%.


[Captioner] 19:26:37
DURING FISCAL YEAR 2019-20,


[Captioner] 19:26:39

TWO YEARS.


[Captioner] 19:26:48
THE ESTIMATED SALES TAX REVENUE


[Captioner] 19:26:51
LOST TO THE PANDEMIC WAS


[Captioner] 19:26:53
APPROXIMATELY $37.8 MILLION.


[Captioner] 19:26:58
ASSUMING FULL RECOVERY BY THE


[Captioner] 19:27:02
END OF FISCAL YEAR 21-22 AND THE


[Captioner] 19:27:03

[Captioner] 19:27:05
WOULD HAVE PROJECTED CURRENT


[Captioner] 19:27:07

[Captioner] 19:27:07
APPROXIMATELY $94 MILLION.


[Captioner] 19:27:11
INSTEAD, WITH TWO QUARTERS OF


[Captioner] 19:27:13

[Captioner] 19:27:21
FISCAL YEAR 22-23 REVENUE OF


[Captioner] 19:27:22
$104.3 MILLION, OF WHICH


[Captioner] 19:27:24
$10.3 MILLION SHOULD BE


[Captioner] 19:27:24
CONSIDERED ONE TIME.


[Captioner] 19:27:29
SINCE THE CURRENT ECONOMIC


[Captioner] 19:27:31
ENVIRONMENT SUGGESTS A SLOWDOWN


[Captioner] 19:27:33
OR POSSIBLY A RECESSION DURING


[Captioner] 19:27:36
FISCAL YEAR 23-24 AND SALES TAX


[Captioner] 19:27:38

[Captioner] 19:27:40

[Captioner] 19:27:48
FOR ESTIMATED REVENUE OF


[Captioner] 19:27:48
$98.7 MILLION.


[Captioner] 19:27:53
THE ESTIMATED ONE-TIME REVENUE


[Captioner] 19:27:54
OF $10.3 MILLION COULD REPRESENT


[Captioner] 19:27:57
A RELEASE OF PENT-UP DEMAND FOR


[Captioner] 19:27:58
PURCHASES THAT WERE DELAYED BY


[Captioner] 19:27:59

ON CITY COUNCIL AND COMMUNITY


[Captioner] 19:43:05

[Captioner] 19:43:05

[Captioner] 19:43:08

ON THE CURRENT LEVEL OF SERVICES


[Captioner] 19:43:24
AND INVEST IN THE CITY'S FUTURE


[Captioner] 19:43:26
WILL DEPEND ON CONTINUED REVENUE


[Captioner] 19:43:28

[Captioner] 19:43:35
THE FIRST PUBLIC HEARING ON THE


[Captioner] 19:43:36
PROPOSED OPERATING BUDGET IS


[Captioner] 19:43:37
SCHEDULED FOR THE CITY COUNCIL


[Captioner] 19:43:39
MEETING ON JUNE 6TH, AND THE


[Captioner] 19:43:41
SECOND PUBLIC HEARING AND BUDGET


[Captioner] 19:43:43
ADOPTION ARE SCHEDULED FOR


[Captioner] 19:43:43
JUNE 13TH.


[Captioner] 19:43:46
THAT COMPLETES MY PRESENTATION,


[Captioner] 19:43:47
AND I'LL HAND THE MEETING BACK


[Captioner] 19:43:50
TO THE MAYOR FOR CITY COUNCIL


[Captioner] 19:43:50
QUESTIONS AND DISCUSSION.


[Captioner] 19:43:53
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:43:55
AND AT THIS TIME, I'D LIKE TO


[Captioner] 19:43:56
TURN TO THE COUNCIL FOR


[Captioner] 19:43:56
CLARIFYING QUESTIONS.


[Captioner] 19:44:00
AND THEN WE'LL ALSO HEAR FROM


[Captioner] 19:44:02
THE PUBLIC BUT ARE THERE ANY


[Captioner] 19:44:02
CLARIFYING QUESTIONS?


[Captioner] 19:44:03
COUNCILMEMBER SHAO?


[Captioner] 19:44:07
>> Councilmember Shao: THANK


[Captioner] 19:44:07
YOU, MADAME MAYOR.


[Captioner] 19:44:10
MY CLARIFYING QUESTION IS


[Captioner] 19:44:13
REGARDING THE ADDED POSITIONS OF


[Captioner] 19:44:14
21 FTE.


[Captioner] 19:44:18
WAS THE PROPOSED ADDITIONAL


[Captioner] 19:44:24
FTEs RIGHT NOW, THE STAFF PER


[Captioner] 19:44:28
CAPITA RATIO IS HOW MUCH AND


[Captioner] 19:44:29
COMPARED WITH NEIGHBORING


[Captioner] 19:44:32
CITIES, YOU KNOW, HOW ARE WE


[Captioner] 19:44:32
DOING IN THAT REGARD?


[Captioner] 19:44:36
I REALIZE THAT IN THE PAST, WE


[Captioner] 19:44:39
WERE VERY PROUD TO HAVE PROBABLY


[Captioner] 19:44:42
THE LOWEST STAFF PER CAPITA


[Captioner] 19:44:43
AMONG ALL THE CITIES IN THE


[Captioner] 19:44:43
AREA.


[Captioner] 19:44:49
>> SO IF YOU WANT TO SEE SOME


[Captioner] 19:44:51
REAL DETAIL NEAR THE BACK OF THE


[Captioner] 19:44:53
BUDGET DOCUMENT, YOU CAN FIND A


[Captioner] 19:44:55
TABLE SHOWING EXACTLY WHERE WE


[Captioner] 19:44:57
ARE, BUT JUST TO GIVE YOU SOME


[Captioner] 19:44:58
SENSE, WE'RE SITTING RIGHT NOW,


[Captioner] 19:45:01
I THINK, IN THE THIRD FROM THE


[Captioner] 19:45:04
LAST PLACE, WE'RE BETWEEN


[Captioner] 19:45:05
PLEASANTON, WHO HAS LOWER


[Captioner] 19:45:07
STAFFING THAN WE DO, AND


[Captioner] 19:45:08
LIVERMORE, WHICH JUST HAS A


[Captioner] 19:45:09
SLIGHTLY HIGHER STAFFING LEVEL.


[Captioner] 19:45:13
BUT TO PUT IT IN PERSPECTIVE, A


[Captioner] 19:45:15
CITY LIKE PALO ALTO HAS MORE


[Captioner] 19:45:17
THAN TWICE THE STAFFING PER


[Captioner] 19:45:17
CAPITA THAT WE DO.


[Captioner] 19:45:21
SO WE DEFINITELY STILL HAVE A


[Captioner] 19:45:22
LONG WAY TO GO TO CATCH UP WITH


[Captioner] 19:45:23
SOME OF OUR NEIGHBORS.


[Captioner] 19:45:25
>> Councilmember Shao: THANK
YOU.


[Captioner] 19:45:28
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:45:29
CLARIFYING QUESTIONS?


[Captioner] 19:45:31
COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL.


[Captioner] 19:45:32
>> Councilmember Campbell:


[Captioner] 19:45:34
THANK YOU FOR THIS PRESENTATION


[Captioner] 19:45:35
AND THE GREAT WORK THAT YOU'RE


[Captioner] 19:45:36
DOING.


[Captioner] 19:45:40
I WAS READING THAT THE


[Captioner] 19:45:42
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET OR


[Captioner] 19:45:43
REVISED BUDGET INDICATED THAT


[Captioner] 19:45:45
THERE MAY BE SOME DELAYS IN


[Captioner] 19:45:45
RECEIVING FUNDING.


[Captioner] 19:45:51
WILL THAT IMPACT US AT ANY POINT


[Captioner] 19:45:52
DURING OUR BUDGET CYCLE?


[Captioner] 19:45:55



[Captioner] 19:45:55
>> Mr. Persselin: I DOUBT IT.


[Captioner] 19:45:58
MOST OF THE STATE FUNDING THAT


[Captioner] 19:46:01
WE RECEIVE COMES IN THE FORM OF


[Captioner] 19:46:03
GRANTS, AND MOST OF THOSE GRANTS


[Captioner] 19:46:05
TEND TO BE REIMBURSEMENT BASIS


[Captioner] 19:46:07
GRANTS, SO I DON'T THINK THAT


[Captioner] 19:46:09
DELAYS IN DIRECT ASSISTANCE


[Captioner] 19:46:11
PROGRAMS THAT THE STATE HAS WITH


[Captioner] 19:46:15
OTHER ENTITIES WOULD AFFECT US


[Captioner] 19:46:16
IN THE GRANT PROGRAMS THAT WE


[Captioner] 19:46:16
RECEIVE.


[Captioner] 19:46:18
>> Councilmember Campbell:


[Captioner] 19:46:18
OKAY, GREAT.


[Captioner] 19:46:22
THE OTHER QUESTION THAT I HAVE


[Captioner] 19:46:24
IS ABOUT THE EBB AND FLOWS OVER


[Captioner] 19:46:24
THE YEARS.


[Captioner] 19:46:28
SO IT LOOKS LIKE IF YOU LOOK ON


[Captioner] 19:46:31
PAGE 4, IT LOOKS AS THOUGH THERE


[Captioner] 19:46:35
ARE GOING TO BE SOME ADDITIONAL


[Captioner] 19:46:37
REVENUES COMING TO US, AND AT


[Captioner] 19:46:41
THE END OF THE THIRD YEAR, IT


[Captioner] 19:46:43
LOOKS AS THOUGH IT GOING TO BE


[Captioner] 19:46:44
UP TO 3.12.


[Captioner] 19:46:46
CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHAT THE EBB AND


[Captioner] 19:46:49
FLOWS KIND OF MEAN HERE IN TERMS


[Captioner] 19:46:51
OF -- AND THEN I ALSO SEE THAT


[Captioner] 19:46:54
THERE WAS A ONE-TIME


[Captioner] 19:46:56
$10.3 MILLION AND SO WHY IS THAT


[Captioner] 19:46:58
A ONE-TIME?


[Captioner] 19:47:00
DOES THAT MAKE SENSE?


[Captioner] 19:47:02
>> Mr. Persselin: SO WE ARE


[Captioner] 19:47:04
PROJECTING THAT REVENUES WILL


[Captioner] 19:47:06
CONTINUE TO GROW OVER THE


[Captioner] 19:47:06
FORECAST PERIOD.


[Captioner] 19:47:09
ALTHOUGH AT A SLOWER RATE THAN


[Captioner] 19:47:11
WE'VE EXPERIENCED HISTORICALLY


[Captioner] 19:47:13
DUE TO OUR EXPECTATION OF A


[Captioner] 19:47:14
SLOWING ECONOMY.


[Captioner] 19:47:18
>> Councilmember Campbell: BUT


[Captioner] 19:47:20
WHEN THE ECONOMY SLOWS, THAT


[Captioner] 19:47:22
MEANS YOU GET LESS REVENUE AS


[Captioner] 19:47:24
OPPOSE TO MORE AND THAT'S WHY


[Captioner] 19:47:26
I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHY THE


[Captioner] 19:47:27
TREND IS UP AND NOT DOWN.


[Captioner] 19:47:28
>> Mr. Persselin: SO WHEN I


[Captioner] 19:47:31
SAY THE GROWTH IS SLOWING, IT


[Captioner] 19:47:33
MEANS THAT IT'S SLOWING BUT IT'S


[Captioner] 19:47:33
STILL GROWING.


[Captioner] 19:47:38
SO REVENUE IS STILL INCREASING,


[Captioner] 19:47:41
BUT IT NOT INCREASING AT THE


[Captioner] 19:47:42
SAME RATE THAT IT WOULD HAVE


[Captioner] 19:47:44
BEEN INCREASING, HAD THE


[Captioner] 19:47:46
ECONOMY -- OR WOULD THE ECONOMY


[Captioner] 19:47:46
BE STRONGER.


[Captioner] 19:47:51
SO WE'RE DEFINITELY NOT PLANNING


[Captioner] 19:47:55
FOR REVENUES TO FLATTEN OR FOR


[Captioner] 19:47:55
REVENUES TO DROP.


[Captioner] 19:47:59
WE ARE PLANNING FOR REVENUES TO


[Captioner] 19:47:59
GROW.


[Captioner] 19:48:03
AS I NOTED EARLIER, IF IT TURNED


[Captioner] 19:48:06
OUT THAT REVENUES DID, IN FACT,


[Captioner] 19:48:08
FLATTEN OR DROP, WE WOULD RELY


[Captioner] 19:48:10
ON THE BUDGET UNCERTAINTY


[Captioner] 19:48:12
RESERVE TO MAINTAIN SERVICES TO


[Captioner] 19:48:14
THE COMMUNITY IN THE NEAR TERM,


[Captioner] 19:48:16
WHILE WE FIGURE OUT WHAT WE NEED


[Captioner] 19:48:17
TO DO TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS.


[Captioner] 19:48:22
NOW YOU ALSO ASKED A QUESTION


[Captioner] 19:48:23
RELATED TO THE ONE-TIME SALES


[Captioner] 19:48:24
TAX REVENUE.


[Captioner] 19:48:29
SO WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF SALES TAX


[Captioner] 19:48:31
REVENUE GROWTH GENERALLY OVER


[Captioner] 19:48:34
THE LAST -- CALL IT FIVE OR SIX


[Captioner] 19:48:37
YEARS, AND SO WE'RE EXPECTING


[Captioner] 19:48:40
GROWTH TO CONTINUE AT, YOU KNOW,


[Captioner] 19:48:41
ROUGHLY THE HISTORICAL RATE.


[Captioner] 19:48:45
SO WHEN WE SEE SOMETHING COME IN


[Captioner] 19:48:46
SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN WE


[Captioner] 19:48:49
WERE ANTICIPATING, WE'RE


[Captioner] 19:48:52
ATTRIBUTED THAT AS A ONE-TIME


[Captioner] 19:48:53
SALES TAX REVENUE.


[Captioner] 19:48:56
SO AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT MIGHT


[Captioner] 19:48:58
CAUSE THAT IS THE CALIFORNIA


[Captioner] 19:49:01
DEPARTMENT OF TAX AND FEE


[Captioner] 19:49:02
ADMINISTRATION, THEY'RE THE ONES


[Captioner] 19:49:05
WHO ACTUALLY ALLOCATE SALES TAX


[Captioner] 19:49:08
REVENUE TO US ON A QUARTERLY


[Captioner] 19:49:09
BASIS, AND THEY'RE THE ONES TO


[Captioner] 19:49:11
GET THE SALES TAX RETURNS FROM


[Captioner] 19:49:11
BUSINESSES.


[Captioner] 19:49:16
WHAT WE FIND IS THAT OFTENTIMES


[Captioner] 19:49:18
BUSINESSES ARE MISREPORTING


[Captioner] 19:49:19
THEIR SALES TAX REVENUES.


[Captioner] 19:49:22
SOMETIMES THAT BENEFITS US BUT


[Captioner] 19:49:25
SOMETIMES IT HURTS US.


[Captioner] 19:49:28
SO WHAT HAPPENS IS, WE MIGHT


[Captioner] 19:49:29
RECEIVE REVENUE IN ONE QUARTER


[Captioner] 19:49:31
AT A CERTAIN LEVEL, AND THEN ONE


[Captioner] 19:49:35
OR TWO QUARTERS LATER, THE CDTFA


[Captioner] 19:49:38
WILL EITHER GIVE US A BIG PILE


[Captioner] 19:49:41
OF MONEY AND SAY OH, THERE WAS A


[Captioner] 19:49:42
MISTAKE TWO QUARTERS AGO, SO


[Captioner] 19:49:45
WE'RE NOW CATCHING YOU UP, OR


[Captioner] 19:49:47
SOMETIMES THEY'LL TAKE MONEY


[Captioner] 19:49:48
AWAY FROM US FOR THE SAME
REASON.


[Captioner] 19:49:52
SO RIGHT NOW WE'RE LOOKING AT


[Captioner] 19:49:54
THAT $10.3 MILLION POTENTIALLY


[Captioner] 19:49:58
AS PART OF WHAT MIGHT BE A CDTFA


[Captioner] 19:50:01
REALLOCATION FROM PRIOR


[Captioner] 19:50:01
PERIODS.


[Captioner] 19:50:04
MAYBE IT'S NOT, AND AS I ALLUDED


[Captioner] 19:50:06
TO, WE ARE SEEING STRONG SALES


[Captioner] 19:50:09
TAX REVENUE GROWTH GENERALLY,


[Captioner] 19:50:11
AND IF IT LOOKS LIKE THIS IS A


[Captioner] 19:50:13
TREND THAT'S CONTINUING, THEN WE


[Captioner] 19:50:16
WILL BUILD THAT ADDITIONAL


[Captioner] 19:50:17
REVENUE INTO OUR FUTURE


[Captioner] 19:50:17
FORECASTS.


[Captioner] 19:50:21
>> Councilmember Campbell: I'M


[Captioner] 19:50:22
HOPING IT WILL TREND THE


[Captioner] 19:50:23
OPPOSITE WAY, THEY WON'T TAKE


[Captioner] 19:50:24
MONEY FROM US.


[Captioner] 19:50:26
ARE YOU GOING TO BE USING THAT


[Captioner] 19:50:29
10.3 TO HELP WITH THE


[Captioner] 19:50:29
7.5 ADJUSTMENT THAT YOU'RE GOING


[Captioner] 19:50:32
TO BE MAKING TO THE UNCERTAINTY


[Captioner] 19:50:32
BUDGET?


[Captioner] 19:50:33
>> Mr. Persselin: SO YOU'RE


[Captioner] 19:50:36
RIGHT IN NOTING THAT THE


[Captioner] 19:50:37
$10.3 MILLION IS ONE-TIME


[Captioner] 19:50:40
REVENUE, AND THE $7.5 MILLION


[Captioner] 19:50:41
INCREASE TO THE BUDGET


[Captioner] 19:50:45
UNCERTAINTY RESERVE IS A USE OF


[Captioner] 19:50:46
ONE-TIME FUNDS, SO YOU COULD SAY


[Captioner] 19:50:49
THAT THE $10.3 MILLION IS


[Captioner] 19:50:52
HELPING US MAKE THAT


[Captioner] 19:50:53
$7.5 MILLION INCREASE.


[Captioner] 19:50:53
>> Councilmember Campbell:


[Captioner] 19:50:53
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:50:56
AND I THINK THAT WAS THE END OF


[Captioner] 19:50:56
MY QUESTIONS.


[Captioner] 19:50:59
I'M SURE I MAY HAVE MORE OVER


[Captioner] 19:51:02
THE NEXT SHORT WHILE BECAUSE I


[Captioner] 19:51:04
HAVE TO READ THAT BIG OLD BOOK,


[Captioner] 19:51:05
KEEP READING.


[Captioner] 19:51:06
>> Mr. Persselin: A LOT OF


[Captioner] 19:51:06
INFORMATION.


[Captioner] 19:51:07
>> Councilmember Campbell: A


[Captioner] 19:51:07
LOT OF INFORMATION.


[Captioner] 19:51:08
THANK YOU SO MUCH.


[Captioner] 19:51:09
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:51:11
NEXT FOR CLARIFYING QUESTIONS,


[Captioner] 19:51:12
VICE MAYOR COX.


[Captioner] 19:51:15
>> Vice Mayor Cox: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:51:19
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR


[Captioner] 19:51:21
IN-DEPTH PRESENTATION TODAY, AND


[Captioner] 19:51:23
AS ALWAYS, AND WINNING ALL THOSE


[Captioner] 19:51:24
FINANCE AWARDS.


[Captioner] 19:51:27
SO CONTINUED CONGRATULATIONS TO


[Captioner] 19:51:27
YOU AND YOUR TEAM.


[Captioner] 19:51:30
I ALSO WANTED TO MENTION, I WAS


[Captioner] 19:51:31
GOING TO ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT


[Captioner] 19:51:35
STAFFING AND I GOT THE UPDATED


[Captioner] 19:51:38
CITYWIDE POSITION CHANGE


[Captioner] 19:51:39
OVERVIEW SO THAT HELPED A LOT,


[Captioner] 19:51:40
THANK YOU SO MUCH, FOR BEING


[Captioner] 19:51:41
ABLE TO PREPARE THAT.


[Captioner] 19:51:43
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I WANTED


[Captioner] 19:51:45
TO KIND OF ASK, I KNOW WE HAD


[Captioner] 19:51:47
TALKED A LOT ABOUT, YOU KNOW,


[Captioner] 19:51:49
THE PURCHASING OF VEHICLES AND


[Captioner] 19:51:50
ESPECIALLY ELECTRICAL VEHICLES.


[Captioner] 19:51:54
IS THAT ALL IN OUR GENERAL FUND


[Captioner] 19:51:55
ACCOUNTED FOR?


[Captioner] 19:51:57
I SAW THERE WAS AN INCREASE WITH


[Captioner] 19:51:59
GAS, BUT I DIDN'T REALLY SEE


[Captioner] 19:52:00
SOMETHING THAT JUMPED OUT THAT


[Captioner] 19:52:02
WE WERE DOING SOME ADDITIONAL


[Captioner] 19:52:05
VEHICLE PURCHASES SINCE


[Captioner] 19:52:07
SOMETIMES WE'VE GOT TO UPGRADE


[Captioner] 19:52:09
TO THE LATEST AND GREATEST TO


[Captioner] 19:52:12
KEEP EVERYONE EFFICIENT AND


[Captioner] 19:52:16
PRODUCTIVE IN THEIR ROLE,


[Captioner] 19:52:18
ESPECIALLY IN THE PUBLIC SAFETY


[Captioner] 19:52:18
ARENA.


[Captioner] 19:52:22
COULD YOU EXPLAIN A


[Captioner] 19:52:24
LITTLE BIT, ARE WE PLANNING TO


[Captioner] 19:52:25
PURCHASE MORE VEHICLES THIS


[Captioner] 19:52:25
YEAR?


[Captioner] 19:52:26
>> Mr. Persselin: ONE OF THE


[Captioner] 19:52:29
THINGS YOU'LL SEE IN THE "OTHER"


[Captioner] 19:52:30
FUNDS SECTION IN THE BUDGET


[Captioner] 19:52:32
DOCUMENT IS A DISCUSSION OF


[Captioner] 19:52:33
VEHICLE REPLACEMENT INTERNAL


[Captioner] 19:52:33
SERVICE FUND.


[Captioner] 19:52:34
SO ONE OF THE PRACTICES OF THE


[Captioner] 19:52:38
CITY OF FREMONT IS TO FUND


[Captioner] 19:52:39
VEHICLE REPLACEMENT ON AN


[Captioner] 19:52:40
ONGOING BASIS.


[Captioner] 19:52:43
RATHER THAN JUST BUDGETING EVERY


[Captioner] 19:52:46
YEAR FOR THE VEHICLES THAT WE


[Captioner] 19:52:47
PLAN TO REPLACE THAT PARTICULAR


[Captioner] 19:52:47
YEAR.


[Captioner] 19:52:50
SO THE AMOUNT THAT WE'RE


[Captioner] 19:52:52
ACTUALLY SHOWING AS COMING FROM


[Captioner] 19:52:54
THE GENERAL FUND IS REALLY JUST


[Captioner] 19:52:56
THE GENERAL FUND'S SHARE OF THE


[Captioner] 19:52:58
ONGOING REPLACEMENT THAT WE DO


[Captioner] 19:53:00
IN THE VEHICLE REPLACEMENT


[Captioner] 19:53:00
FUND.


[Captioner] 19:53:03
IN THE VEHICLE REPLACEMENT FUND


[Captioner] 19:53:05
BUDGET ITSELF, YOU'LL SEE NEXT


[Captioner] 19:53:07
YEAR'S BUDGETED AMOUNT FOR


[Captioner] 19:53:08
VEHICLE REPLACEMENT.


[Captioner] 19:53:12
NOW, OUR PLAN IS TO REPLACE


[Captioner] 19:53:16
EXISTING VEHICLES WITH ELECTRIC


[Captioner] 19:53:16
VEHICLES.


[Captioner] 19:53:18
SO WE AREN'T NECESSARILY SETTING


[Captioner] 19:53:20
ASIDE ADDITIONAL MONEY FOR


[Captioner] 19:53:23
ELECTRIC VEHICLES BECAUSE THE


[Captioner] 19:53:25
MONEY FOR VEHICLE REPLACEMENT IS


[Captioner] 19:53:27
ALREADY IN THE VEHICLE


[Captioner] 19:53:27
REPLACEMENT FUND.


[Captioner] 19:53:30
NOW I WILL NOTE THAT AS YOU


[Captioner] 19:53:33
KNOW, ONE OF THE LIMITATIONS ON


[Captioner] 19:53:35
OUR ABILITY TO QUICKLY REPLACE


[Captioner] 19:53:38
OUR GAS FLEET WITH ELECTRIC


[Captioner] 19:53:39
VEHICLES IS CHARGING


[Captioner] 19:53:39
INFRASTRUCTURE.


[Captioner] 19:53:43
AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT


[Captioner] 19:53:45
YOU'LL SEE IN THE CIP TONIGHT IS


[Captioner] 19:53:49
THAT WE ARE MAKING INVESTMENTS


[Captioner] 19:53:52
TOWARD ACQUIRING ELECTRIC


[Captioner] 19:53:53
VEHICLE CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE


[Captioner] 19:53:56
SO THAT WE CAN MAKE MORE RAPID


[Captioner] 19:53:59
PROGRESS TOWARDS REPLACING OUR


[Captioner] 19:54:00
VEHICLES WITH ELECTRIC.


[Captioner] 19:54:03
>> Vice Mayor Cox: YES, I DID


[Captioner] 19:54:04
SEE THAT ON -- I DIDN'T WANT TO


[Captioner] 19:54:05
ASK THAT QUESTION BECAUSE WE


[Captioner] 19:54:09
WEREN'T ON THAT TOPIC


[Captioner] 19:54:10
BUT I APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING


[Captioner] 19:54:10
THAT UP.


[Captioner] 19:54:12
ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS I


[Captioner] 19:54:13
NOTICED, THAT WITH THE INCREASE


[Captioner] 19:54:14
WITH THE PUBLIC WORKS STAFF,


[Captioner] 19:54:17
THAT YOU HAVE AN ADDITIONAL


[Captioner] 19:54:19
STREET SWEEPER OPERATOR AND


[Captioner] 19:54:21
STREET MAINTENANCE WORKER, AND I


[Captioner] 19:54:23
WAS WONDERING, IS ALSO THOSE


[Captioner] 19:54:24
TYPE OF STREET EQUIPMENT BEING


[Captioner] 19:54:27
INCLUDED SO WE CAN PROVIDE


[Captioner] 19:54:29
BETTER SERVICE TO OUR RESIDENTS


[Captioner] 19:54:32
AND THE SERVICES CARRYING OUT


[Captioner] 19:54:34
FOR STREET CLEANING, IS THAT


[Captioner] 19:54:36
ADDITIONAL STAFF MEMBERS GOING


[Captioner] 19:54:39
TO ALSO -- DO WE HAVE ADDITIONAL


[Captioner] 19:54:40
EQUIPMENT TO BE ABLE TO CARRY


[Captioner] 19:54:43
THAT OUT OR IS THAT ALREADY


[Captioner] 19:54:45
EMBEDDED IN -- WE'RE USING WHAT


[Captioner] 19:54:47
WE'VE GOT AND IT JUST A SHIFT, I


[Captioner] 19:54:49
GUESS THE DIFFERENCE IN SHIFT


[Captioner] 19:54:51
OPERATIONS, THEY WORK IN


[Captioner] 19:54:51
DIFFERENT SHIFTS?


[Captioner] 19:54:53
>> Mr. Persselin: SO IT TURNS


[Captioner] 19:54:54
OUT THAT RIGHT NOW, THE


[Captioner] 19:54:56
CONSTRAINT ON OUR ABILITY TO DO


[Captioner] 19:54:58
STREET SWEEPING IS STAFFING


[Captioner] 19:54:58
RATHER THAN EQUIPMENT.


[Captioner] 19:55:02
SO ADDING THAT STAFF MEMBER WILL


[Captioner] 19:55:05
ALLOW US TO MAKE MORE EFFICIENT


[Captioner] 19:55:07
USE OF THE EQUIPMENT THAT WE


[Captioner] 19:55:07
CURRENTLY HAVE.


[Captioner] 19:55:12
SO WE'RE ADDING A NEW STREET


[Captioner] 19:55:15
SWEEPER/OPERATOR, BUT IN FISCAL


[Captioner] 19:55:16
23-24, WE ARE NOT ADDING A NEW


[Captioner] 19:55:18
STREET SWEEPER ITSELF.


[Captioner] 19:55:19
>> Vice Mayor Cox: OH, OKAY.


[Captioner] 19:55:20
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:55:21
THANK YOU FOR THE CLARIFICATION


[Captioner] 19:55:21
ON THAT PART.


[Captioner] 19:55:29
AND I'M GOING TO PAUSE FOR A


[Captioner] 19:55:30
MOMENT.


[Captioner] 19:55:31
THERE MAY BE SOME OTHER


[Captioner] 19:55:32
QUESTIONS THAT POP UP.


[Captioner] 19:55:33
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.


[Captioner] 19:55:34
>> Mr. Persselin: SURE.


[Captioner] 19:55:37
>> Mayor Mei: SEEING NO OTHER


[Captioner] 19:55:38
CLARIFYING QUESTIONS FROM THE


[Captioner] 19:55:39
COUNCIL AT THIS TIME I'D LIKE TO


[Captioner] 19:55:40
TURN TO PUBLIC COMMENT.


[Captioner] 19:55:42
I'D LIKE TO OPEN THE PUBLIC


[Captioner] 19:55:43
COMMENT PERIOD AT THIS TIME.


[Captioner] 19:55:48
>> Ms. Gauthier: WE HAVE ONE


[Captioner] 19:55:49
CARD IN PERSON.


[Captioner] 19:55:54
LYNN MILLER.


[Captioner] 19:55:55
>> Mayor Mei: WELCOME.


[Captioner] 19:56:03
>> GOOD EVENING, CITY COUNCIL.


[Captioner] 19:56:04
WE'RE SO HAPPY TO BE HERE.


[Captioner] 19:56:06
URBAN FOREST FRIENDS BACK


[Captioner] 19:56:07
AGAIN.


[Captioner] 19:56:10
WE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE WILL BE


[Captioner] 19:56:12
AN URBAN FORESTER POSITION ADDED


[Captioner] 19:56:14
ON FROM WHAT YOU HAVE SAID THIS


[Captioner] 19:56:17
EVENING, AND WE COULDN'T BE MORE


[Captioner] 19:56:17
THRILLED.


[Captioner] 19:56:20
WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO


[Captioner] 19:56:27
FOLLOW ALONG CAREFULLY BECAUSE


[Captioner] 19:56:28
WE STILL DO NOT HAVE THE


[Captioner] 19:56:29
POSITION ORIGINALLY FILLED AS OF


[Captioner] 19:56:31
LAST FRIDAY, AND THAT WAS THE


[Captioner] 19:56:36
COMBINED POSITION OF THE CITY


[Captioner] 19:56:38
ARBORIST, AND THE URBAN


[Captioner] 19:56:40
FORESTER, WHICH WOULD BE -- AS


[Captioner] 19:56:43
WE DISCUSSED BEFORE, WAY TOO


[Captioner] 19:56:44
MUCH TO DO.


[Captioner] 19:56:47
SO NOW WE'RE WONDERING IF THE


[Captioner] 19:56:49
JOB DESCRIPTION WILL BE REDONE.


[Captioner] 19:56:52
WE KNOW AS SUZANNE HAD SAID


[Captioner] 19:56:54
BEFORE THAT SOMETIMES DURING


[Captioner] 19:56:56
STORMS, ET CETERA, EVERYBODY


[Captioner] 19:56:57
PITCHES IN AND DOES ALL JOBS.


[Captioner] 19:57:00
WE UNDERSTAND THAT, BECAUSE AS


[Captioner] 19:57:02
IT WAS POINTED OUT, THE STAFFING


[Captioner] 19:57:03
IS VERY, VERY TIGHT.


[Captioner] 19:57:06
BUT IN GENERAL, WE WOULD LIKE TO


[Captioner] 19:57:09
KNOW THAT THERE'S A CLEAR


[Captioner] 19:57:10
DIFFERENTIATION ON A DAY-TO-DAY


[Captioner] 19:57:15
BASIS SO THAT THE NEW URBAN


[Captioner] 19:57:16
FORESTER WILL BE DEDICATED TO


[Captioner] 19:57:18
OUR MANAGEMENT PLAN AND TAKING


[Captioner] 19:57:21
ON ALL THE MANY THINGS THAT HAVE


[Captioner] 19:57:24
NOT BEEN ACCOMPLISHED AND WILL


[Captioner] 19:57:26
MOVE OUR WHOLE CITY FORWARD


[Captioner] 19:57:29
WORKING TOGETHER TO GET MORE


[Captioner] 19:57:30
GREENERY AND SHADE FOR FREMONT.


[Captioner] 19:57:33
I THINK ONE OTHER PERSON WOULD


[Captioner] 19:57:34
LIKE TO SPEAK, ANNIE.


[Captioner] 19:57:35
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:57:37
THANK YOU, THANK YOU FROM ALL OF


[Captioner] 19:57:37
US.


[Captioner] 19:57:42
>> Ms. Gauthier: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:57:44
WE'RE GOING TO GO TO KELLY ON


[Captioner] 19:57:44
ZOOM.


[Captioner] 19:57:50
MR. ABREU.


[Captioner] 19:57:50
>> THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:58:00
I'D LIKE TO POINT TO THE OVERALL


[Captioner] 19:58:01
TREND ON THE BUDGET.


[Captioner] 19:58:03
FIRST OF ALL, TODAY IS VERY


[Captioner] 19:58:05
UNUSUAL THAT YOU ACTUALLY HAD A


[Captioner] 19:58:07
BUDGET ITEM AND DIDN'T HOLD IT


[Captioner] 19:58:07
LATE IN THE EVENING.


[Captioner] 19:58:11
THIS CITY COUNCIL HAS SPENT FAR


[Captioner] 19:58:14
MORE TEAM ON MISSION PEAK THAN


[Captioner] 19:58:15
IT HAS ON THE CITY BUDGET.


[Captioner] 19:58:22
AND THE CITY BUDGET RUNS ON


[Captioner] 19:58:23
AUTOPILOT AND THE CITY COUNCIL


[Captioner] 19:58:24
DOESN'T REALLY UNDERSTAND THE


[Captioner] 19:58:25
BUDGET BECAUSE THEY NEVER PAY


[Captioner] 19:58:26
ATTENTION TO IT.


[Captioner] 19:58:31
AND LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE


[Captioner] 19:58:31
STAFFING FOR A MINUTE.


[Captioner] 19:58:34
IF YOU LOOK BACK OVER THE LAST


[Captioner] 19:58:36
FOUR YEARS OR SO, STAFFING HAS


[Captioner] 19:58:39
GONE UP BY LESS THAN 2% A YEAR.


[Captioner] 19:58:42
IF YOU LOOK AT THE BUDGET, THE


[Captioner] 19:58:44
BUDGET HAS GONE UP BY MAYBE


[Captioner] 19:58:44
AROUND 6% A YEAR.


[Captioner] 19:58:46
SO WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU?


[Captioner] 19:58:50
EACH STAFF -- EACH STAFFER HAS


[Captioner] 19:58:54
MORE AND MORE RESOURCES PER


[Captioner] 19:58:54
PERSON TO SPEND.


[Captioner] 19:58:57
BUT OF COURSE IF YOU BELIEVE


[Captioner] 19:59:01
THAT MONEY DRIVES SERVICES, THEN


[Captioner] 19:59:02
THAT'S -- THEN YOU FEEL


[Captioner] 19:59:05
EVERYTHING IS FINE, BUT IF


[Captioner] 19:59:06
PEOPLE BELIEVE AS I DO THAT


[Captioner] 19:59:07
STAFFING DRIVES SERVICES AND


[Captioner] 19:59:12
PEOPLE DO THE WORK, THEN THINGS


[Captioner] 19:59:13
ARE NOT LOOKING SO GOOD IN
FREMONT.


[Captioner] 19:59:16
AND THIS STAFFING RATIO PER


[Captioner] 19:59:19
CAPITA THAT EVERYONE LOOKS AT SM


[Captioner] 19:59:21
NOT A SIGN OF WONDERFULNESS.


[Captioner] 19:59:24
IT'S A SIGN OF WEAKNESS, BECAUSE


[Captioner] 19:59:25
WE'RE NOT -- WE DON'T HAVE THE


[Captioner] 19:59:28
MANPOWER OR WOMAN POWER OR LABOR


[Captioner] 19:59:32
POWER TO DELIVER THE SERVICES


[Captioner] 19:59:33
THAT PALO ALTO IS DELIVERING.


[Captioner] 19:59:37
AND IF YOU LOOK AT -- TAKE A


[Captioner] 19:59:38
LOOK AT THE BREAKDOWN.


[Captioner] 19:59:41
YOU'LL SEE THAT, WHAT, ABOUT


[Captioner] 19:59:42
HALF THE -- A LITTLE UNDER --


[Captioner] 19:59:45
ALMOST HALF OF THE STAFFERS ARE


[Captioner] 19:59:45
IN PUBLIC SAFETY.


[Captioner] 19:59:49
BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE MONEY,


[Captioner] 19:59:51
THREE QUARTERS OF THE MONEY GOES


[Captioner] 19:59:51
INTO PUBLIC SAFETY.


[Captioner] 19:59:53
SO WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU?


[Captioner] 19:59:58
PUBLIC SAFETY IS GETTING ALL THE


[Captioner] 20:00:00
RESOURCES THAT THEY NEED AND


[Captioner] 20:00:02
MORE, AND MAYBE IT'S NOT -- JUST


[Captioner] 20:00:05
LIKE WHEN THE STREET SWEEPERS


[Captioner] 20:00:07
ARE GETTING THE LABOR BUT NOT


[Captioner] 20:00:08
GETTING THE MACHINES BECAUSE THE


[Captioner] 20:00:09
LABOR IS WHAT THEY NEED, THEY


[Captioner] 20:00:11
DON'T NEED MORE MACHINES, ON THE


[Captioner] 20:00:13
PUBLIC SAFETY END, WHEN PEOPLE


[Captioner] 20:00:18
SAY WE NEED MORE MONEY IN PUBLIC


[Captioner] 20:00:20
SAFETY, MAYBE IT'S NOT MORE


[Captioner] 20:00:20
MONEY WE NEED.


[Captioner] 20:00:22
MAYBE IT IT'S MORE STAFFING.


[Captioner] 20:00:22
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:00:31
>> Ms. Gauthier: MY


[Captioner] 20:00:32

[Captioner] 20:00:34
WE'LL GO BACK TO THE IN-PERSON,


[Captioner] 20:00:35
AND THE LAST SPEAKER IS ANNIE.


[Captioner] 20:00:48

[Captioner] 20:00:51
I'M SPEAKING ON BEHALF AND WITH


[Captioner] 20:00:51

[Captioner] 20:00:56
ADVOCATING FOR AN ADDITIONAL


[Captioner] 20:00:58
POSITION FOR AN URBAN FORESTER


[Captioner] 20:01:00
TO ENSURE THE SUCCESS OF OUR


[Captioner] 20:01:02
RECENTLY PASSED URBAN FOREST


[Captioner] 20:01:02

[Captioner] 20:01:05
AND WE SEE THAT THE STAFF


[Captioner] 20:01:06

GRATITUDE THAT IT LOOKS LIKE OUR


[Captioner] 20:01:14
ADVOCACY HAS BEEN LISTENED TO


[Captioner] 20:01:16
AND THAT OUR VOICES HAVE BEEN


[Captioner] 20:01:16
HEARD ON THAT FRONT.


[Captioner] 20:01:23
SO AS LYNN BEFORE WE SAID, WE


[Captioner] 20:01:24
DECLARE DIFFERENTIATION OF JOBS


[Captioner] 20:01:26
BETWEEN OUR EXISTING CITY


[Captioner] 20:01:29
ARBORIST AND THIS NEW URBAN


[Captioner] 20:01:29
FORESTER POSITION.

DOING SO WITH ADDITIONAL


[Captioner] 20:01:36
COLLABORATION.


[Captioner] 20:01:39
SPECIFICALLY, CONCERNING OUR


[Captioner] 20:01:40

[Captioner] 20:01:49
CREATION AND THE STANDING UP OF


[Captioner] 20:01:50
THAT PROGRAM.


[Captioner] 20:01:52
SO WHILE WE THANK YOU, WE ALSO


[Captioner] 20:01:54
LOOK FORWARD TO EVEN MORE


[Captioner] 20:01:55
ADDITIONAL COLLABORATION TO


[Captioner] 20:01:58

[Captioner] 20:02:00
EQUITABLE, IS SAFE, AND IS


[Captioner] 20:02:00
HEALTHY FOR OUR CITY.


[Captioner] 20:02:01
THANK YOU SO MUCH.


[Captioner] 20:02:06

[Captioner] 20:02:07

AT THIS TIME, I'D LIKE TO RETURN


[Captioner] 20:02:11

[Captioner] 20:02:13
I'M GOING TO CLOSE THE PUBLIC


[Captioner] 20:02:14
COMMENT PERIOD AND I'D LIKE TO


[Captioner] 20:02:15
RETURN IT BACK TO THE COUNCIL


[Captioner] 20:02:16
FOR COUNCIL DISCUSSIONS.


[Captioner] 20:02:26
ARE THERE ANY ADDITIONAL COUNCIL


[Captioner] 20:02:26

[Captioner] 20:02:27
OKAY.


[Captioner] 20:02:29
AT THIS TIME, I WANTED TO THANK


[Captioner] 20:02:32

[Captioner] 20:02:35
IMPORTANT FOR US AND WE DO


[Captioner] 20:02:35
APPRECIATE THAT PEOPLE HAVE COME


[Captioner] 20:02:38

[Captioner] 20:02:39
CONCERN AND WE'VE HEARD SOME OF


[Captioner] 20:02:40
THOSE AND WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT


[Captioner] 20:02:42
EVEN MORE OF THOSE DURING OUR


[Captioner] 20:02:44
CONVERSATION NEXT ITEM, WHICH IS


[Captioner] 20:02:46
A PROPOSED CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT
PROGRAM.


[Captioner] 20:02:50
I ALSO WANTED TO ENCOURAGE


[Captioner] 20:02:51
PEOPLE THAT THIS IS THE


[Captioner] 20:02:52
BEGINNING OF THE CONVERSATION


[Captioner] 20:02:53
ABOUT BUDGET.


[Captioner] 20:02:56
THERE WILL BE MULTIPLE BUDGET


[Captioner] 20:02:57
HEARINGS AS WE'VE ALSO LISTED


[Captioner] 20:02:58

[Captioner] 20:02:59

[Captioner] 20:03:00
CONTINUE TO FOLLOW, AND I KNOW


[Captioner] 20:03:02
THAT OUR COUNCIL MAY HAVE


[Captioner] 20:03:02
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS


[Captioner] 20:03:03
AS WE MOVE FORWARD.


[Captioner] 20:03:07
VICE MAYOR COX, DID YOU


[Captioner] 20:03:08
HAVE SOMETHING TO ADD?


[Captioner] 20:03:10
OKAY.


[Captioner] 20:03:12
ANOTHER QUESTION, PLEASE.


[Captioner] 20:03:14
VICE MAYOR COX.


[Captioner] 20:03:17
>> Vice Mayor Cox: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:03:19
I WANTED TO FIND OUT, DID WE GET


[Captioner] 20:03:22
ANY REIMBURSEMENT FOR FEMA YET


[Captioner] 20:03:24
FOR ANY OF THE STORM RECOVERY?


[Captioner] 20:03:26
>> Mr. Persselin: WE ARE


[Captioner] 20:03:28
CONTINUING TO WORK WITH FEMA.


[Captioner] 20:03:29
IT'S A LENGTHY PROCESS.


[Captioner] 20:03:32
WE'RE HAVING BIWEEKLY MEETINGS


[Captioner] 20:03:35
WITH OUR FEMA REPRESENTATIVES,


[Captioner] 20:03:37
BUT THEY'RE STILL COLLECTING ALL


[Captioner] 20:03:39
THE INFORMATION AND DATA RELATED


[Captioner] 20:03:39
TO OUR DAMAGES.


[Captioner] 20:03:41
>> Vice Mayor Cox: OKAY.


[Captioner] 20:03:44
AND I'M SURE THAT'S WHY WE HAVE


[Captioner] 20:03:47
THE EXTRA MONEY THAT'S SET ASIDE


[Captioner] 20:03:48
FOR THE BUDGET UNCERTAINTY


[Captioner] 20:03:48
RESERVES FOR THAT.


[Captioner] 20:03:49
OKAY.


[Captioner] 20:03:49
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.


[Captioner] 20:03:53
>> Mayor Mei: NO, I


[Captioner] 20:03:55
APPRECIATE, I THINK THAT THE


[Captioner] 20:03:57
CITY IS WORKING MUCH LIKE OTHER


[Captioner] 20:03:58
CITIES ARE COLLECTIVELY IN


[Captioner] 20:03:59
RAISING OUR VOICES TO MAKE SURE


[Captioner] 20:04:01
THAT FOR SOME OF THIS YEAR'S


[Captioner] 20:04:03
UNANTICIPATED IMPACTS, THAT


[Captioner] 20:04:04
WE'RE ABLE TO ADDRESS, AND THAT


[Captioner] 20:04:07
ALSO HELPS US TO BE BETTER


[Captioner] 20:04:08
PREPARED, WHICH LEADS US INTO


[Captioner] 20:04:09
THE NEXT AGENDA ITEM.


[Captioner] 20:04:11
SO THANK YOU SO MUCH, DIRECTOR


[Captioner] 20:04:13
PERSSELIN, TO YOU AND YOUR


[Captioner] 20:04:13
TEAM.


[Captioner] 20:04:14
PLEASE SHARE MY APPRECIATION TO


[Captioner] 20:04:14

[Captioner] 20:04:20
IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM.


[Captioner] 20:04:24
AND WE'LL HAVE A PRESENTATION


[Captioner] 20:04:27

[Captioner] 20:04:29
HANS LARSEN, AND OUR COMMUNITY


[Captioner] 20:04:31

AND I THINK -- WELL, ACTUALLY


[Captioner] 20:04:35
OUR FINANCE DIRECTOR IS


[Captioner] 20:04:36
STAYING -- HE'S JUST SHIFTING


[Captioner] 20:04:39
DOWN A LITTLE BIT DOWN THE DAIS,


[Captioner] 20:04:41
SO WE CAN STILL ASK HIM


[Captioner] 20:04:41
QUESTIONS.


[Captioner] 20:04:44
BUT AT THIS TIME, WE'LL TURN IT


[Captioner] 20:04:45
OVER FOR THE PRESENTATION AND


[Captioner] 20:04:46
THEN AFTERWARDS, FOLLOW-UP


[Captioner] 20:04:46
QUESTIONS.


[Captioner] 20:04:47
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:04:49
>> Mr. Larsen: GREAT.


[Captioner] 20:04:50
THANK YOU, MAYOR MEI, MEMBERS OF


[Captioner] 20:04:50

[Captioner] 20:04:54
WE'RE VERY PLEASED TO PRESENT TO

YOU TONIGHT THE PROPOSED CAPITAL


[Captioner] 20:04:57
IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM FOR THE


[Captioner] 20:04:58
UPCOMING FIVE-YEAR PERIOD.


[Captioner] 20:05:01
AND SO OUR CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT


[Captioner] 20:05:03
PROGRAM IS SORT OF THE CITY'S


[Captioner] 20:05:05
PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE, SO THIS


[Captioner] 20:05:08
DEALS WITH THE PARKS,


[Captioner] 20:05:09
TRANSPORTATION, OUR PUBLIC


[Captioner] 20:05:11
BUILDINGS AND OTHER CIVIC


[Captioner] 20:05:11
INFRASTRUCTURE.


[Captioner] 20:05:14
JOINING ME ON THE PRESENTATION


[Captioner] 20:05:16
IS SUZANNE WOLF, OUR COMMUNITY


[Captioner] 20:05:18
SERVICES DIRECTOR, AND DAVE


[Captioner] 20:05:20
PERSSELIN, OUR FINANCE DIRECTOR


[Captioner] 20:05:21
WILL ASSIST WITH COUNCIL


[Captioner] 20:05:22
DISCUSSION AND ANY QUESTIONS.


[Captioner] 20:05:27
IF I COULD GET THE SLIDES TO


[Captioner] 20:05:27
COME UP?


[Captioner] 20:05:33
THERE WE GO.


[Captioner] 20:05:34
ALL RIGHT.


[Captioner] 20:05:34
ALL RIGHT.


[Captioner] 20:05:37
WE'LL GO TO THE NEXT SLIDE,


[Captioner] 20:05:38
WHICH IS AN OUTLINE OF THE


[Captioner] 20:05:39
PRESENTATION.


[Captioner] 20:05:42
SO WE'LL SHARE WITH YOU AN


[Captioner] 20:05:46
OVERVIEW OF THE CIP PROCESS AND


[Captioner] 20:05:46
REVENUE STATUS.


[Captioner] 20:05:49
AS YOU MAY RECALL IN MARCH, WE


[Captioner] 20:05:50
PROVIDED KIND OF AN OVERVIEW OF


[Captioner] 20:05:52
THIS, SO THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF


[Captioner] 20:05:55
A REFRESHER FOR YOU, AND THEN


[Captioner] 20:05:58
WE'LL SHARE WITH YOU THE


[Captioner] 20:06:00
SPECIFIC PROPOSALS IN THE


[Captioner] 20:06:03
PROPOSED CIP AND WHAT KIND OF


[Captioner] 20:06:04
OUTCOMES THAT THEY DELIVER TO


[Captioner] 20:06:06
THE COMMUNITY IN THE AREA OF


[Captioner] 20:06:07
PARKS, TRANSPORTATION, AND CIVIC


[Captioner] 20:06:09
AND BUILDING FACILITIES, AND


[Captioner] 20:06:10
THEN WE'LL TURN TO YOU, THE


[Captioner] 20:06:12
COUNCIL, FOR ANY QUESTIONS YOU


[Captioner] 20:06:14
HAVE, LISTEN TO PUBLIC COMMENT,


[Captioner] 20:06:18
AND THEN HEAR ANY DISCUSSION OR


[Captioner] 20:06:21
DIRECTION, AND SO THIS IS OUR


[Captioner] 20:06:22
PROPOSED CIP.


[Captioner] 20:06:26
WE DO HAVE MEETINGS IN JUNE IN


[Captioner] 20:06:27
WHICH IF THERE'S SOME DIRECTION


[Captioner] 20:06:28
FROM COUNCIL HERE TODAY, WE CAN


[Captioner] 20:06:29
MAKE AN AMENDMENT TO THAT.


[Captioner] 20:06:31
THE COUNCIL MEETINGS IN JUNE


[Captioner] 20:06:33
WILL BE THE FORMAL APPROVAL


[Captioner] 20:06:33
PROCESS.


[Captioner] 20:06:40
SO JUST AS A REMINDER, THIS IS A


[Captioner] 20:06:42
FIVE-YEAR PROGRAM, BUT THE


[Captioner] 20:06:44
COUNCIL WILL ADOPT THE FIRST TWO


[Captioner] 20:06:46
YEARS OF THE PROGRAM AS THE


[Captioner] 20:06:47
BUDGET FOR OUR CAPITAL PROGRAM.


[Captioner] 20:06:53
AS I MENTIONED, WE SHARED KIND


[Captioner] 20:06:55
OF THE INITIAL CONVERSATION


[Captioner] 20:06:56
ABOUT THE CIP UPDATE IN MARCH.


[Captioner] 20:06:58
WE'RE HERE IN MAY WITH THE


[Captioner] 20:07:00
PROPOSED BUDGET, AND THEN THE


[Captioner] 20:07:02
APPROVAL PROCESS WILL BE IN


[Captioner] 20:07:04
JUNE, AND THIS, AGAIN, MATCHES


[Captioner] 20:07:06
THE SIMILAR SCHEDULE FOR THE


[Captioner] 20:07:07
CITY'S OPERATING BUDGET.


[Captioner] 20:07:13
WE CAN SEE THIS IS A GOOD NEWS


[Captioner] 20:07:13
CHART.


[Captioner] 20:07:16
YOU CAN SEE THAT THIS PROPOSED


[Captioner] 20:07:18
CIP IS THE HIGHEST LEVEL THAT


[Captioner] 20:07:20
WE'VE HAD IN THE LAST FIVE


[Captioner] 20:07:22
CYCLES, BUT IT IS FOLLOWING KIND


[Captioner] 20:07:25
OF A STEADY INCREASE, AND THEN


[Captioner] 20:07:30
WE HAD THE LAST CIP CYCLE WAS A


[Captioner] 20:07:32
SIGNIFICANT DROPOFF LARGELY DUE


[Captioner] 20:07:35
TO COVID INDUCED REDUCTIONS IN


[Captioner] 20:07:37
ECONOMIC ACTIVITY, DEVELOPMENT


[Captioner] 20:07:38
ACTIVITY, BUT WE'RE NOW UP AGAIN


[Captioner] 20:07:40
AND HAVE SORT OF RECOVERED FROM


[Captioner] 20:07:40
THAT.


[Captioner] 20:07:42
MOST OF THE RECOVERY, THOUGH, IS


[Captioner] 20:07:46
AS A RESULT OF THE CITY'S STRONG


[Captioner] 20:07:47
GENERAL FUND PERFORMANCE, AND


[Captioner] 20:07:49
THE ABILITY TO TRANSFER FUNDS


[Captioner] 20:07:51
FROM THE GENERAL FUND FOR USE


[Captioner] 20:07:55
INTO THE CAPITAL PROGRAM, AND ON


[Captioner] 20:07:56
SEVERAL OCCASIONS THE CITY


[Captioner] 20:08:00
COUNCIL HAS TAKEN EXTRA REVENUES


[Captioner] 20:08:02
AND THEN RESERVED THEM TO BE


[Captioner] 20:08:03
ALLOCATED IN THIS CIP PROCESS.


[Captioner] 20:08:05
NEXT SLIDE.


[Captioner] 20:08:07
SO JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT, SOME


[Captioner] 20:08:11
OF THE UPS AND DOWNS AND


[Captioner] 20:08:12
REVENUES FOR THE CIP.


[Captioner] 20:08:14
SO THE BIGGEST CONTRIBUTOR


[Captioner] 20:08:16
TOWARDS THE INCREASE IS FROM THE


[Captioner] 20:08:17
GENERAL FUND TRANSFER, AN


[Captioner] 20:08:18
THERE'S A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT


[Captioner] 20:08:19
TYPES OF TRANSFERS.


[Captioner] 20:08:22
THERE IS ANNUAL ONGOING


[Captioner] 20:08:24
INCREASES FOR CAPITAL


[Captioner] 20:08:26
MAINTENANCE, WHICH SUPPORT


[Captioner] 20:08:29
IMPROVEMENTS IN SERVICE AND


[Captioner] 20:08:32
CONDITION FOR OUR PAVEMENT, OUR


[Captioner] 20:08:33
BUILDINGS, OUR PARKS AND OUR


[Captioner] 20:08:34
TREES.


[Captioner] 20:08:36
THERE IS A ONE-TIME TRANSFER TO


[Captioner] 20:08:39
AUGMENT THE MEDIAN ISLAND


[Captioner] 20:08:40
LANDSCAPE PROGRAM, AND WE'VE


[Captioner] 20:08:41
HEARD FROM THE COMMUNITY A


[Captioner] 20:08:42
STRONG INTEREST IN THAT, AND SO


[Captioner] 20:08:43
WE'RE ABLE TO MAKE SOME PROGRESS


[Captioner] 20:08:43
THERE.


[Captioner] 20:08:48
AND THEN THERE IS ONE TIME MONEY


[Captioner] 20:08:50
THAT'S ALLOCATED FOR A


[Captioner] 20:08:52
SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF NEW


[Captioner] 20:08:57
CAPITAL PROJECTS, WHICH WE


[Captioner] 20:08:58
SHARED WITH YOU LAST TIME AND WE


[Captioner] 20:09:00
WILL BRING THOSE UP AGAIN IN


[Captioner] 20:09:01
TERMS OF HIGHLIGHTING SORT OF


[Captioner] 20:09:03
THE KEY ELEMENTS OF THE CAPITAL


[Captioner] 20:09:03
PROGRAM.


[Captioner] 20:09:07
IT IS NOTED PRIVATE DEVELOPMENT


[Captioner] 20:09:09
REVENUES HAVE DECLINED DUE TO


[Captioner] 20:09:12
SORT OF THE HIGHER COSTS OF


[Captioner] 20:09:15
DEVELOPMENT AND FINANCING, SO


[Captioner] 20:09:17
SOME CAPITAL POTS ARE UP AND


[Captioner] 20:09:18
SOME OF THEM ARE DOWN SO PRIVATE


[Captioner] 20:09:20
DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY, WHICH IS


[Captioner] 20:09:22
PARTICULARLY AFFECTED, SO OUR


[Captioner] 20:09:26
PARK PROGRAMS, IT HAS ALSO


[Captioner] 20:09:27
AFFECTED OUR TRANSPORTATION


[Captioner] 20:09:27
PROGRAM TO SOME DEGREE.


[Captioner] 20:09:30
ON THE OTHER HAND, AS THE


[Captioner] 20:09:32
ECONOMY HAS IMPROVED AND MORE


[Captioner] 20:09:37
PEOPLE ARE DRIVING AND CONSUMING


[Captioner] 20:09:39
GASOLINE, HOPEFULLY WE GET MORE


[Captioner] 20:09:41
PEOPLE, YOU KNOW, MOVING TOWARDS


[Captioner] 20:09:42
ELECTRIC CARS AND WE'LL TALK


[Captioner] 20:09:44
ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING IN THAT


[Captioner] 20:09:45
REGARD.


[Captioner] 20:09:47
BUT GAS TAX REVENUES HAVE


[Captioner] 20:09:48
INCREASED SO THAT HAS PROVIDED


[Captioner] 20:09:50
SOME BENEFITS IN THE


[Captioner] 20:09:51
TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM TO OFFSET


[Captioner] 20:09:52
SOME OF THE REDUCTIONS FROM


[Captioner] 20:09:53
PRIVATE DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY.


[Captioner] 20:09:58
AND THEN OVERALL, WE HAVE SEEN A


[Captioner] 20:10:00
LESSENING AMOUNT OF GRANTS THAT


[Captioner] 20:10:03
WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO RECEIVE,


[Captioner] 20:10:05
PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF VERY STRONG


[Captioner] 20:10:06
POLICIES AT THE FEDERAL, STATE


[Captioner] 20:10:08
AND REGIONAL LEVEL TO INVEST IN


[Captioner] 20:10:10
COMMUNITIES THAT ARE DESIGNATED


[Captioner] 20:10:12
AS BEING HISTORICALLY


[Captioner] 20:10:14
DISADVANTAGES, WHICH FREMONT


[Captioner] 20:10:16
DOES NOT HAVE ANY, BUT THERE IS


[Captioner] 20:10:18
SOME GLIMMER OF GOOD NEWS IN


[Captioner] 20:10:21
THAT THERE ARE SOME NEW FEDERAL


[Captioner] 20:10:24
CRITERIA THAT JUST CAME OUT


[Captioner] 20:10:27
LITERALLY IN THE LAST COUPLE


[Captioner] 20:10:29
MONTHS FOCUSING NOT SO MUCH ON


[Captioner] 20:10:31
HISTORICALLY DAMAGED COMMUNITIES


[Captioner] 20:10:33
BUT A MORE BROADER APPLICATION


[Captioner] 20:10:34
OF DISADVANTAGED LOWER INCOME


[Captioner] 20:10:35
COMMUNITIES, SO WE NOW HAVE


[Captioner] 20:10:37
THREE NEIGHBORHOODS IN FREMONT


[Captioner] 20:10:39
THAT ARE CONSIDERED


[Captioner] 20:10:41
DISADVANTAGED AND ARE ELIGIBLE


[Captioner] 20:10:44
FOR GRANTS, AND THESE ARE THE


[Captioner] 20:10:46
NEIGHBORHOODS OF CALBRILLO,


[Captioner] 20:10:47
SUNDALE AND GRIMMER.


[Captioner] 20:10:50
AND SO FINGERS CROSSED WE'LL BE


[Captioner] 20:10:53
ABLE TO SECURE SOME GRANT


[Captioner] 20:10:54
FUNDINGS IN FUTURE YEARS,


[Captioner] 20:10:55
PARTICULARLY FOR THOSE


[Captioner] 20:10:55
NEIGHBORHOODS.


[Captioner] 20:11:00
SO I WANT TO POINT OUT AGAIN


[Captioner] 20:11:01
THAT SOME OF THE REVENUES THAT


[Captioner] 20:11:04
WE RECEIVE ARE RESTRICTED, SO WE


[Captioner] 20:11:06
RECEIVED THEM FOR A PARTICULAR


[Captioner] 20:11:07
PURPOSE AND SO THEY HAVE TO BE


[Captioner] 20:11:12
USED FOR THAT PURPOSE, AND SO A


[Captioner] 20:11:14
VERY LARGE PORTION OF OUR MONEYS


[Captioner] 20:11:16
COME FROM GRANT SOURCES OR


[Captioner] 20:11:17
DEDICATED FOR A PARTICULAR


[Captioner] 20:11:19
PURPOSE, BUT IN THIS CIP, WE DO


[Captioner] 20:11:21
HAVE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF


[Captioner] 20:11:23
MONEY COMING IN FROM THE GENERAL


[Captioner] 20:11:26
FUND, WHICH IS DISCRETIONARY TO


[Captioner] 20:11:27
THE CITY COUNCIL ON HOW WE APPLY


[Captioner] 20:11:27
THEM.


[Captioner] 20:11:30
WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING IS A


[Captioner] 20:11:34
DISTRIBUTION OF THOSE FUNDS


[Captioner] 20:11:38
ACROSS ALL OF OUR PROGRAMS IN


[Captioner] 20:11:39
TRANSPORTATION, PARKS AND


[Captioner] 20:11:40
BUILDINGS, SO YOU CAN SEE


[Captioner] 20:11:41
INCREASES IN EACH OF THOSE, AND


[Captioner] 20:11:42
THEN WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT


[Captioner] 20:11:44
AMOUNT OF ONE-TIME REVENUE


[Captioner] 20:11:47
THAT'S PRIMARILY BEING TARGETED


[Captioner] 20:11:50
TO CITY BUILDING FACILITIES, SO


[Captioner] 20:11:52
$58 MILLION FOR THAT CATEGORY.


[Captioner] 20:11:56
BUT WANTED TO NOTE THAT -- SO


[Captioner] 20:11:57
THERE'S NINE MAJOR PROJECTS,


[Captioner] 20:11:59
FOUR OF THEM ARE LOCATED WITHIN


[Captioner] 20:12:02
CITY PARKS, AND SO WHILE THEY'RE


[Captioner] 20:12:04
A BUILDING FACILITY LIKE A


[Captioner] 20:12:05
COMMUNITY CENTER OR PARK


[Captioner] 20:12:07
RESTROOMS, THEY DO BENEFIT OUR


[Captioner] 20:12:08
PARK PROGRAMS AS WELL, AND


[Captioner] 20:12:10
SUZANNE WILL SHARE WITH


[Captioner] 20:12:13
YOU SOME OF THE DETAILS OF THAT.


[Captioner] 20:12:13
ALL RIGHT.


[Captioner] 20:12:18
SO THIS HIGHLIGHTS SOME OF THE


[Captioner] 20:12:22
ANNUAL TRANSFERS THAT HAVE BEEN


[Captioner] 20:12:24
MADE TO THE CIP FOR VARIOUS


[Captioner] 20:12:26
PROGRAMS, SO WE CAN SEE A


[Captioner] 20:12:28
NOTABLE INCREASE ANNUALLY IN


[Captioner] 20:12:31
PAVEMENT MAINTENANCE, BUILDING


[Captioner] 20:12:33
MAINTENANCE, PARKS CAPITAL


[Captioner] 20:12:35
REPLACEMENT, MORE FUNDING FOR


[Captioner] 20:12:36
STREET TREE MAINTENANCE AN


[Captioner] 20:12:38
REPLACEMENT, AND THEN THE


[Captioner] 20:12:42
ONE-TIME INCREASE FOR MEDIAN


[Captioner] 20:12:43
LANDSCAPING HAS BEEN AN


[Captioner] 20:12:44
AUGMENTATION TO AN EXISTING


[Captioner] 20:12:44
PROGRAM WE HAVE.


[Captioner] 20:12:47
AS YOU MAY RECALL, JUST GOING


[Captioner] 20:12:49
BACK A FEW YEARS AGO, THE AMOUNT


[Captioner] 20:12:51
OF ANNUAL FUNDING WAS ABOUT


[Captioner] 20:12:53
$5 MILLION A YEAR FOR CAPITAL


[Captioner] 20:12:54
MAINTENANCE.


[Captioner] 20:12:56
IT INCREASED LAST YEAR TO


[Captioner] 20:12:58
$7 MILLION, AND NOW YOU CAN SEE


[Captioner] 20:13:01
AN ONGOING LEVEL OF OVER


[Captioner] 20:13:03
$12 MILLION FOR THIS AREA.


[Captioner] 20:13:05
SO THIS IS AN AREA WHERE WE'RE


[Captioner] 20:13:07
PROPOSING SOME SIGNIFICANT


[Captioner] 20:13:07
INVESTMENT.


[Captioner] 20:13:07
ALL RIGHT.


[Captioner] 20:13:09
SO THE NEXT PART OF THE


[Captioner] 20:13:11
PRESENTATION, I'LL TURN IT OVER


[Captioner] 20:13:13
TO SUZANNE, WHO WILL INTRODUCE


[Captioner] 20:13:15

TONIGHT.


[Captioner] 20:13:34
THE MOST SIGNIFICANT PROJECT IN


[Captioner] 20:13:36
THE PROPOSED CIP IS THE


[Captioner] 20:13:39
ALLOCATION OF $21 MILLION IN


[Captioner] 20:13:40

[Captioner] 20:14:30
IN TOTAL, WE HAVE ALREADY

[Captioner] 20:14:44

[Captioner] 20:14:51
PRIORITY OF THE COMMUNITY FROM


[Captioner] 20:14:52
PARKS AND RECREATION MASTER PLAN


[Captioner] 20:14:54
WAS TO IMPROVE OUR EXISTING


[Captioner] 20:14:54
RESTROOMS.


[Captioner] 20:14:56
AS WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT


[Captioner] 20:14:58
STRUCTURAL ISSUES, POOR PLUMBING


[Captioner] 20:15:00

LARGE DOG PARK, AS IT HAS


[Captioner] 20:15:22
OUTLASTED ITS LIFESPAN, IN POOR


[Captioner] 20:15:23

[Captioner] 20:15:33
$1 MILLION.


[Captioner] 20:15:36
FOLLOWING OUR LAST PRESENTATION


[Captioner] 20:15:38
IN MARCH, THERE WAS A


[Captioner] 20:15:40
SIGNIFICANT COMMUNITY AND


[Captioner] 20:15:41
COUNCIL INTEREST IN IMPROVING


[Captioner] 20:15:43
THE AUTOMALL PARKWAY MEDIAN


[Captioner] 20:15:45

TO INCREASE THE ANNUAL FUNDING


[Captioner] 20:16:16
FOR THE 50/50 STREET TREE


[Captioner] 20:16:17
PROGRAM BY $100,000.


[Captioner] 20:16:19
IN THIS PILOT YEAR, WE WANT TO


[Captioner] 20:16:21
INCREASE THE NUMBER OF


[Captioner] 20:16:22
HOMEOWNERS THAT PRUNE, REMOVE


[Captioner] 20:16:24
AND REPLACE STREET TREES AS WE


[Captioner] 20:16:25
INCREASE OUR EDUCATION WITH THE


[Captioner] 20:16:25
COMMUNITY.


[Captioner] 20:16:28
WE WANT HOMEOWNERS TO


[Captioner] 20:16:30
EFFECTIVELY CARE FOR THEIR


[Captioner] 20:16:31
STREET TREES, AND THIS WILL


[Captioner] 20:16:35
ALLOW THE


[Captioner] 20:16:38
REIMBURSEMENT TO DOUBLE FROM


[Captioner] 20:16:40
$750 PER TREE TO $1,500 PER


[Captioner] 20:16:40

[Captioner] 20:16:44
OUR NEW PARK PROJECTS


[Captioner] 20:16:46
FOLLOWS OUR MASTER PLAN


[Captioner] 20:16:47
PRIORITIES THAT WERE PROVIDED BY


[Captioner] 20:16:48
THE COMMUNITY AND ADOPTED BY THE


[Captioner] 20:16:48
COUNCIL LAST YEAR.


[Captioner] 20:16:51
THE RECREATION COMMISSION HELD


[Captioner] 20:16:53
THREE COMMUNITY MEETINGS TO


[Captioner] 20:16:55
DISCUSS THE CIP AND UNANIMOUSLY


[Captioner] 20:16:56
SUPPORTED THE PROPOSED PARKS


[Captioner] 20:16:56
PLAN.


[Captioner] 20:17:00
IN ADDITION TO THE PARK RESTROOM


[Captioner] 20:17:01
INNOVATIONS AND THE NEW


[Captioner] 20:17:02
MULTISERVICE COMMUNITY CENTER,


[Captioner] 20:17:04
THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT GAPS IN


[Captioner] 20:17:06
TRAILS, DOG PARKS AND PICKLEBALL


[Captioner] 20:17:06
COURTS.


[Captioner] 20:17:09
TO ACHIEVE THESE GOALS, WE ARE


[Captioner] 20:17:12
PROPOSING DOG PARKS AT THE NEW


[Captioner] 20:17:14
PATTERSON RANCH NEAR ARDENWOOD


[Captioner] 20:17:16
REGIONAL PRESERVE AND VALLEJO


[Captioner] 20:17:17
MILL HISTORICAL PARK.


[Captioner] 20:17:20
WE'RE ALSO CONTINUING WITH OUR


[Captioner] 20:17:22
EFFORTS -- WITH OUR CONSULTANT


[Captioner] 20:17:25
DCG STRATEGIES TO PURSUE NEW


[Captioner] 20:17:26
PARKLAND ACQUISITION FOR AREAS


[Captioner] 20:17:27
THAT DO NOT HAVE A 10-MINUTE


[Captioner] 20:17:29
WALK, AND THIS WILL BE ANNOUNCED


[Captioner] 20:17:34
TO COUNCIL


[Captioner] 20:17:34
SEPARATELY.


[Captioner] 20:17:35
TRAIL EFFORT CONTINUE WITH THE

[Captioner] 20:17:48
STAFF ALSO RECOMMENDS AT THE

COMPLETION OF THE COMMUNITY PARK


[Captioner] 20:17:51
UPGRADES BE COMPLETED THIS


[Captioner] 20:17:51

FINALLY, THIS PLAN INCLUDES FULL


[Captioner] 20:17:56
FUNDING FOR PALM AVENUE


[Captioner] 20:17:56
COMMUNITY PARK.


[Captioner] 20:17:58
NOW I'LL TURN IT BACK TO HANS TO


[Captioner] 20:17:59
DISCUSS THE CIP INVESTMENT IN


[Captioner] 20:18:00
TRANSPORTATION.


[Captioner] 20:18:00
HANS?


[Captioner] 20:18:02
>> Mr. Larsen: THANK YOU,


[Captioner] 20:18:02
SUZANNE.


[Captioner] 20:18:04
NEXT SLIDE.


[Captioner] 20:18:05
SO IN THE AREA OF


[Captioner] 20:18:07
TRANSPORTATION, I WANT TO FOCUS


[Captioner] 20:18:09
ON JUST BASIC MAINTENANCE THAT


[Captioner] 20:18:10
WE'RE PROVIDING, SO AS NOTED


[Captioner] 20:18:12
THERE'S A TRANSFER OF FUNDING


[Captioner] 20:18:14
FOR PAVEMENT MAINTENANCE THAT


[Captioner] 20:18:16
REPRESENTS A $2.5 MILLION


[Captioner] 20:18:17
INCREASE IN INVESTMENT.


[Captioner] 20:18:21
WHAT THIS IS GOING TO ALLOW US


[Captioner] 20:18:23
TO DO IS TO PROVIDE MORE


[Captioner] 20:18:24
FREQUENT MAINTENANCE ON OUR


[Captioner] 20:18:26
STREETS THAT WE CONSIDER KIND OF


[Captioner] 20:18:27
OUR HIGH VISIBILITY STREETS.


[Captioner] 20:18:29
SO THESE ARE STREETS WITHIN OUR


[Captioner] 20:18:30
COMMERCIAL DISTRICTS, WHICH WE


[Captioner] 20:18:33
WANT TO SUPPORT THE VITALITY OF,


[Captioner] 20:18:35
AS WELL AS GATEWAY STREETS


[Captioner] 20:18:36
COMING IN TO FREMONT, SAY OFF


[Captioner] 20:18:38
THE FREEWAY INTERCHANGES, AND SO


[Captioner] 20:18:40
THESE ARE STREETS THAT REALLY


[Captioner] 20:18:42
KIND OF SHAPE THE -- SORT OF THE


[Captioner] 20:18:44
ESTHETICS AND THE VIEW OF THE


[Captioner] 20:18:46
COMMUNITY, AND WE HAVE BEEN VERY


[Captioner] 20:18:47
FRUGAL IN TERMS OF THE MONEY


[Captioner] 20:18:48
THAT WE GET FOR PAVEMENT


[Captioner] 20:18:50
MAINTENANCE, BUT WITH THE NEW


[Captioner] 20:18:52
RESOURCES, WE FEEL THAT THIS IS


[Captioner] 20:18:54
A TIME TO MAYBE UPGRADE THE


[Captioner] 20:18:55
STANDARDS, PARTICULARLY FOR SOME


[Captioner] 20:18:56
OF OUR MOST IMPORTANT STREETS IN


[Captioner] 20:18:56
THE COMMUNITY.


[Captioner] 20:18:59
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE


[Captioner] 20:19:01
ALSO DOING, THERE'S A CONNECTION


[Captioner] 20:19:03
HERE BETWEEN SORT OF OPERATING


[Captioner] 20:19:06
AND CAPITAL, AND IT WAS


[Captioner] 20:19:07
MENTIONED THAT PART OF THE


[Captioner] 20:19:10
OPERATING BUDGET INCLUDES ADDING


[Captioner] 20:19:12
A FOUR-PERSON STREET MAINTENANCE


[Captioner] 20:19:14
TEAM, AND WHAT THAT IS GOING TO


[Captioner] 20:19:16
BE ABLE TO ALLOW US TO DO IS


[Captioner] 20:19:18
PROVIDE MORE TIMELY MAINTENANCE


[Captioner] 20:19:20
FOR POTHOLE REPAIRS, AS WELL AS


[Captioner] 20:19:22
A HIGHER QUALITY LEVEL OF


[Captioner] 20:19:26
MAINTENANCE FOR POTHOLE


[Captioner] 20:19:26
REPAIRS.


[Captioner] 20:19:28
TYPICALLY WHAT WE DO, WE WANT TO


[Captioner] 20:19:29
MAKE SURE THAT OUR STREETS ARE


[Captioner] 20:19:32
SAFE AND WE'LL PATCH IT WITH


[Captioner] 20:19:36
SORT OF A TEMPORARY PATCH, AND


[Captioner] 20:19:38
THEN ONCE A YEAR WE WILL


[Captioner] 20:19:39
CONTRACT OUT HAVING CONTRACTORS


[Captioner] 20:19:42
DO SORT OF A MORE SIGNIFICANT


[Captioner] 20:19:43
REPAIR IN PREPARATION FOR


[Captioner] 20:19:43
ANOTHER TREATMENT.


[Captioner] 20:19:47
BY HAVING OUR OWN STAFF


[Captioner] 20:19:49
RESOURCES, WE'RE ABLE TO DO KIND


[Captioner] 20:19:52
OF THE HIGH QUALITY REPAIR SORT


[Captioner] 20:19:55
OF RIGHT AT THE BEGINNING, AND


[Captioner] 20:19:59
SO THAT IT BETTER AND WE CAN


[Captioner] 20:20:00
ACTUALLY BELIEVE THAT WE CAN


[Captioner] 20:20:02
SAVE MONEY IN OUR PAVEMENT


[Captioner] 20:20:04
MAINTENANCE PROGRAM BY HAVING


[Captioner] 20:20:06
OUR OWN RESOURCES DO THE WORK,


[Captioner] 20:20:08
AS OPPOSED TO HAVE TO PUT OUT A


[Captioner] 20:20:11
SET OF PLANS, REVIEW THE WORK,


[Captioner] 20:20:12
INSPECT IF WE CONTRACT IT OUT.


[Captioner] 20:20:14
SO WE'RE REALLY EXCITED ABOUT


[Captioner] 20:20:17
STEPPING UP THE QUALITY OF THE


[Captioner] 20:20:18
PAVEMENT MAINTENANCE IN


[Captioner] 20:20:18
FREMONT.


[Captioner] 20:20:22
THIS SAME FOUR-PERSON CREW IS


[Captioner] 20:20:24
ALSO GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO


[Captioner] 20:20:26
SIDEWALK REPAIR WORK, AND ONE OF


[Captioner] 20:20:28
THE BIG ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF THE


[Captioner] 20:20:31
PAST YEARS IS WE'RE IN THE LAST


[Captioner] 20:20:32
PHASE OF COMPLETING SIDEWALKS


[Captioner] 20:20:34
THAT ARE CONSIDERS SEVERELY


[Captioner] 20:20:34
DAMAGED.


[Captioner] 20:20:38
SO WHERE THERE'S MORE THAN A


[Captioner] 20:20:40
4-INCH UPLIFT OF THE SIDEWALKS,


[Captioner] 20:20:41
AND THIS PICTURE HERE SHOWS AN


[Captioner] 20:20:43
EXAMPLE OF THAT, WHERE TREE


[Captioner] 20:20:45
ROOTS HAVE HEAVED THE SIDEWALK,


[Captioner] 20:20:47
WE WILL PATCH IT, IT DOESN'T


[Captioner] 20:20:48
NECESSARILY LOOK GOOD, BUT IT


[Captioner] 20:20:51
AVOIDS THE TRIPPING HAZARD, BUT


[Captioner] 20:20:53
THESE EXTREME CASES, WE WILL


[Captioner] 20:20:55
HAVE COMPLETED ALL OF THESE


[Captioner] 20:20:57
WORSE CASES OVER THE NEXT COUPLE


[Captioner] 20:20:59
OF YEARS, AND THEN WITH OUR OWN


[Captioner] 20:21:01
CREWS, WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO


[Captioner] 20:21:02
MOVE INTO REPAIRING SIDEWALKS


[Captioner] 20:21:04
THAT ARE IN A MORE MODERATE


[Captioner] 20:21:04
CONDITION.


[Captioner] 20:21:08
SO RATHER THAN DEPENDING ON AN


[Captioner] 20:21:12
ANNUAL CONTRACT TO DO THIS WORK,


[Captioner] 20:21:13
WE'LL BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THESE


[Captioner] 20:21:14
ON A MORE ONGOING BASIS.


[Captioner] 20:21:16
SO OUR TEAMS WILL BE DOING


[Captioner] 20:21:19
PAVEMENT WORK SORT AFTER SORT OF


[Captioner] 20:21:22
RAINY SEASONS, AND WE HAVE MORE


[Captioner] 20:21:23
DEMAND WORK THERE, AND THEN ALSO


[Captioner] 20:21:26
BE ABLE TO DO MORE SIDEWALK


[Captioner] 20:21:26
REPAIR.


[Captioner] 20:21:29
SO WE'RE EXCITED ABOUT IMPROVING


[Captioner] 20:21:31
CONDITIONS BOTH FOR PAVEMENT AND


[Captioner] 20:21:32
SIDEWALKS WITH BOTH INVESTMENTS


[Captioner] 20:21:34
FROM THE CAPITAL AND OPERATING


[Captioner] 20:21:34
BUDGET.


[Captioner] 20:21:40
WE'RE ALSO GOING TO BE SEEING A


[Captioner] 20:21:43
LOT MORE ADVANCEMENT IN OUR


[Captioner] 20:21:45
SIGNAL MODERNIZATION PROGRAM,


[Captioner] 20:21:46
AND SO AS PART OF THE FIRST


[Captioner] 20:21:49
PHASE OF BRINGING IN INVESTMENT,


[Captioner] 20:21:51
FIGURING OUT THE ENGINEERING ON


[Captioner] 20:21:54
HOW TO MODERNIZE OUR OLD TRAFFIC


[Captioner] 20:21:55
SIGNAL SYSTEM, WE ARE NOW


[Captioner] 20:21:57
BEGINNING TO SEE SOME


[Captioner] 20:22:00
SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS WITH


[Captioner] 20:22:03
TECHNOLOGY AN SIGNAL TIMING, ON


[Captioner] 20:22:05
CORRIDORS LIKE FREMONT


[Captioner] 20:22:06
BOULEVARD, PASEO PADRE PARKWAY,


[Captioner] 20:22:08
AND ROLLING OUT OVER THE NEXT


[Captioner] 20:22:10
YEAR AND TWO WILL BE EXPANDING


[Captioner] 20:22:13
THAT TO MANY OF OUR OTHER MAJOR


[Captioner] 20:22:15
STREET CORRIDORS AS NOTED HERE


[Captioner] 20:22:15
ON THE SLIDE.


[Captioner] 20:22:18
WE'LL CONTINUE TO MAKE


[Captioner] 20:22:19
INVESTMENTS IN SAFETY AND


[Captioner] 20:22:24
IMPROVING CONDITIONS FOR WALKING


[Captioner] 20:22:24
AND BICYCLING.


[Captioner] 20:22:27
AS MENTIONED, WE ARE DOING A NEW


[Captioner] 20:22:28
ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION PLAN THIS


[Captioner] 20:22:30
YEAR WHICH WILL SET KIND OF A


[Captioner] 20:22:34
NEW FIVE-YEAR SET OF PRIORITIES


[Captioner] 20:22:35
FOR ADDRESSING WALKING AND


[Captioner] 20:22:37
BIKING THROUGH FREMONT, AND THEN


[Captioner] 20:22:39
OUR EFFORTS TO CONTINUE TO


[Captioner] 20:22:42
IMPROVE SAFETY TO KEY PROJECTS,


[Captioner] 20:22:45
ONE IS ALONG PASEO PADRE PARKWAY


[Captioner] 20:22:47
BETWEEN WASHINGTON AND DRISCOLL,


[Captioner] 20:22:48
AND THEN WE'RE INCREASINGLY


[Captioner] 20:22:49
HEARING FROM THE COMMUNITY ABOUT


[Captioner] 20:22:51
THE WONDERFUL NEW DUSTERBERRY


[Captioner] 20:22:53
PARK THAT'S OPENING, BUT A NEED


[Captioner] 20:22:55
TO BE ABLE TO HAVE SAFE ACCESS


[Captioner] 20:22:57
FROM THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY.


[Captioner] 20:22:59
SO WE'RE INVESTING IN PLANNING


[Captioner] 20:23:02
WORK TO BE ABLE TO MAKE SOME


[Captioner] 20:23:05
IMPROVEMENTS IN THE LARGER


[Captioner] 20:23:06
NEIGHBORHOOD IN TERMS OF SAFE


[Captioner] 20:23:08
ACCESS TO THIS WONDERFUL NEW


[Captioner] 20:23:08
PARK.


[Captioner] 20:23:15
YOU'VE SEEN THIS BEFORE, WE'RE


[Captioner] 20:23:16
VERY ACTIVE WORKING ON A LOT OF


[Captioner] 20:23:17
SORT OF MAJOR PROJECTS WITH


[Captioner] 20:23:19
REGIONAL FUNDING AND JUST


[Captioner] 20:23:22
REMINDERS OF SOME OF THOSE,


[Captioner] 20:23:23
262 UPGRADE, IRVINGTON BART


[Captioner] 20:23:25
STATION, UPGRADING FREEWAY


[Captioner] 20:23:30
INTERCHANGES, LOTS OF TRAIL 


[Captioner] 20:23:31
PROJECT, MULTIMODAL CORRIDORS


[Captioner] 20:23:33
AND RAILROAD QUIET ZONE PROJECT


[Captioner] 20:23:34
IN CENTERVILLE.


[Captioner] 20:23:39
I'M GOING TO MOVE TO SORT OF THE


[Captioner] 20:23:40
LAST PART HERE, AND THIS IS OUR


[Captioner] 20:23:43
BUILDING AND CIVIC FACILITIES.


[Captioner] 20:23:48
SO AS PART OF THE NEW ONE-TIME


[Captioner] 20:23:49
GENERAL FUND INVESTMENT, WE'RE


[Captioner] 20:23:52
ABLE TO MAKE SOME REALLY GREAT


[Captioner] 20:23:56
PROGRESS IN IMPROVING THE


[Captioner] 20:23:57
DEFERRED MAINTENANCE THAT WE'VE


[Captioner] 20:23:58
HAD IN MANY OF OUR BUILDINGS.


[Captioner] 20:24:02
AND SO OUR CITY HALL HERE IS


[Captioner] 20:24:06
GOING TO BE GETTING A $5 MILLION


[Captioner] 20:24:08
INVESTMENT, MOST OF THAT GOING


[Captioner] 20:24:11
TO LONG AWAITED -- BUT ALSO FIRE


[Captioner] 20:24:14
ALARM SYSTEMS, ADA ACCESS AND


[Captioner] 20:24:15
HEATING VENTILATING AIR


[Captioner] 20:24:16
CONDITIONING SYSTEMS WILL BE


[Captioner] 20:24:17
UPGRADED AS WELL.


[Captioner] 20:24:23
WHICH DO HAVE A LOT OF OUTDATED


[Captioner] 20:24:25
HVAC SYSTEMS ACROSS THE CITY.


[Captioner] 20:24:27
MANY OF THESE ARE STILL RELYING


[Captioner] 20:24:32
ON FREON WHICH IS VERY DIFFICULT


[Captioner] 20:24:34
TO GET, IT'S A SUBSTANCE NO


[Captioner] 20:24:35
LONGER BEING AVAILABLE, AND SO


[Captioner] 20:24:36
WE'RE GOING TO BE REPLACING


[Captioner] 20:24:42
THESE OLD SYSTEMS IN 11


[Captioner] 20:24:42
BUILDINGS OVER THE NEXT THREE


[Captioner] 20:24:45
YEARS WITH A ONE-TIME INVESTMENT


[Captioner] 20:24:46
OF $8 MILLION.


[Captioner] 20:24:50
AND EVERYWHERE WE CAN, MOVE TO


[Captioner] 20:24:51
ELECTRIC SYSTEMS TO HELP SUPPORT


[Captioner] 20:24:53
OUR CLIMATE ACTION PLAN.


[Captioner] 20:24:54
WE WILL BE DOING THAT.


[Captioner] 20:24:58
WE HAVE SOME INVESTMENTS IN


[Captioner] 20:25:00
 PUBLIC SAFETY FACILITIES.


[Captioner] 20:25:06
WE WILL BE UPGRADING OUR FIRE


[Captioner] 20:25:07
COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS TO ALIGN


[Captioner] 20:25:09
WITH A NEW COUNTY PROGRAM, AND


[Captioner] 20:25:10
THEN BUILDING FOR OUR POLICE


[Captioner] 20:25:12
DEPARTMENT A NEW VEHICLE


[Captioner] 20:25:14
EVIDENCE STORAGE FACILITY.


[Captioner] 20:25:19
AND THEN AS WAS BROUGHT UP, WE


[Captioner] 20:25:22
ARE WANTING TO KEEP PACE WITH


[Captioner] 20:25:25
CONVERTING OF OUR FLEET VEHICLES


[Captioner] 20:25:26
TO ELECTRIC, AND A KEY THING


[Captioner] 20:25:28
THAT WE NEED TO DO THERE IS TO


[Captioner] 20:25:30
BE ABLE TO POWER THESE


[Captioner] 20:25:32
FACILITIES, AND SO WE'VE


[Captioner] 20:25:36
IDENTIFIED A FIVE-YEAR PLAN AT


[Captioner] 20:25:37
$5 MILLION THAT WILL ALLOW US TO


[Captioner] 20:25:40
BE ABLE TO BRING IN THE CHARGING


[Captioner] 20:25:41
INFRASTRUCTURE TO BE ABLE TO


[Captioner] 20:25:44
SUPPORT OUR FLEET


[Captioner] 20:25:44
ELECTRIFICATION PROGRAM.


[Captioner] 20:25:50
AND THEN ANOTHER NEW THING THAT


[Captioner] 20:25:55
THIS IS AN ADDITION TO WHAT WE


[Captioner] 20:25:57
SHARED WITH YOU BACK IN MARCH


[Captioner] 20:25:59
WITH ADDITIONAL INCREASE TOWARDS


[Captioner] 20:26:02
BUILDING MAINTENANCE, WE TO A


[Captioner] 20:26:03
LARGE DEGREE ARE ADDRESSING A


[Captioner] 20:26:06
LOT OF SORT OF THE LONG-STANDING


[Captioner] 20:26:07
DEFERRED MAINTENANCE, AND WITH


[Captioner] 20:26:11
ADDITIONAL REVENUE, WE'RE ABLE


[Captioner] 20:26:13
TO KIND OF MOVE INTO SOME


[Captioner] 20:26:15
DIFFERENT AREAS AND WE'VE


[Captioner] 20:26:16
LARGELY FOCUSED ON THE CORE


[Captioner] 20:26:18
BUILDINGS THAT WE HAVE TO


[Captioner] 20:26:20
MAINTAIN THEIR FUNCTIONALITY,


[Captioner] 20:26:22
BUT WE'VE HAD VERY LITTLE MONEY


[Captioner] 20:26:26
TO PUT TOWARDS OUR HISTORIC


[Captioner] 20:26:27
BUILDINGS OR EVEN THE PAVEMENT


[Captioner] 20:26:29
CONDITIONS AT OUR CITY


[Captioner] 20:26:29
FACILITIES.


[Captioner] 20:26:32
SO WE'RE ABLE TO, WITH THIS NEW


[Captioner] 20:26:34
INVESTMENT, BE ABLE TO DO ROOF


[Captioner] 20:26:36
REPAIRS AT OUR HISTORIC


[Captioner] 20:26:38
BUILDINGS, AS WELL AS IMPROVE


[Captioner] 20:26:39
DRIVEWAYS AND PARKING LOTS AT


[Captioner] 20:26:41
MANY OF OUR CITY FACILITIES,


[Captioner] 20:26:42
INCLUDING RIGHT HERE AT CITY


[Captioner] 20:26:42
HALL.


[Captioner] 20:26:45
ALL RIGHT.


[Captioner] 20:26:48
I THINK JUST IN CONCLUSION, WE


[Captioner] 20:26:51
SHARED THIS SLIDE WITH YOU IN


[Captioner] 20:26:54
MARCH, AND WHILE WE HAVE A LOT


[Captioner] 20:26:56
OF SIGNIFICANT NEW INVESTMENT,


[Captioner] 20:26:59
WE HAVE A BIGGER SET OF NEEDS,


[Captioner] 20:27:01
SO WE QUANTIFY IT AS ABOUT A


[Captioner] 20:27:02
BILLION DOLLARS OF NEEDS.


[Captioner] 20:27:05
BULL WITH THE INVESTMENT AND THE


[Captioner] 20:27:07
RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE PROPOSED


[Captioner] 20:27:11
CIP, WE ARE ABLE TO ADDRESS WHAT


[Captioner] 20:27:13
WE CONSIDER THE HIGHEST


[Captioner] 20:27:13
PRIORITIES, THE URGENT


[Captioner] 20:27:14
PRIORITIES.


[Captioner] 20:27:18
SO HIGHLIGHTING THIS TOP


[Captioner] 20:27:20
CATEGORY, SO THIS GROUPING IS


[Captioner] 20:27:23
ESSENTIALLY FULLY FUNDED WITH


[Captioner] 20:27:24
THE PROPOSED CIP.


[Captioner] 20:27:27
STILL OUTSTANDING IS WHETHER WE


[Captioner] 20:27:29
CAN GET GRANT FUNDING FOR STORM


[Captioner] 20:27:32
DAMAGE REPAIRS, BUT WE DO HAVE A


[Captioner] 20:27:33
SEPARATE EMERGENCY FUND THAT CAN


[Captioner] 20:27:34
ADDRESS THAT.


[Captioner] 20:27:38
A LOT OF OUR OTHER ADOPTED


[Captioner] 20:27:40
PRIORITIES, WE DO HAVE SOME


[Captioner] 20:27:41
MONEY TO ADDRESS THOSE.


[Captioner] 20:27:43
CERTAINLY NOT ENOUGH TO FULLY


[Captioner] 20:27:45
COVER ALL THOSE NEEDS.


[Captioner] 20:27:48
BUT WHAT WE'RE ABLE TO ADD,


[Captioner] 20:27:49
WHAT'S CIRCLED IN GREEN HERE IS


[Captioner] 20:27:52
SOME NEW CATEGORIES WHICH I


[Captioner] 20:27:55
HIGHLIGHTED, WHICH INCLUDES


[Captioner] 20:27:59
PAVEMENT REPAIRS AT SOME OF OUR


[Captioner] 20:28:00
CITY FACILITY, PRESERVING OUR


[Captioner] 20:28:04
HISTORIC ASSETS, AND STARTING UP


[Captioner] 20:28:05
A MEDIAN LANDSCAPING PROGRAM,


[Captioner] 20:28:06
WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT WE'VE


[Captioner] 20:28:07
HEARD FROM THE COMMUNITY.


[Captioner] 20:28:12
AND SO THAT'S KIND OF IN A


[Captioner] 20:28:12
NUTSHELL.


[Captioner] 20:28:14
IT'S NOT EVERYTHING, BUT IT'S


[Captioner] 20:28:15
CERTAINLY, YOU KNOW, A BIG DENT


[Captioner] 20:28:16
AND A LOT OF NEEDS OUT THERE,


[Captioner] 20:28:18
AND WE'RE REALLY PLEASED AND


[Captioner] 20:28:20
PROUD TO BE ABLE TO PRESENT THIS


[Captioner] 20:28:20
PROGRAM TO YOU.


[Captioner] 20:28:23
I THINK THAT'S OUR LAST SLIDE.


[Captioner] 20:28:26
AND WE'LL TURN IT BACK TO MAYOR


[Captioner] 20:28:28
MEI AND THE COUNCIL FOR ANY


[Captioner] 20:28:28
QUESTIONS OR DISCUSSIONS.


[Captioner] 20:28:29
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:28:32
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU FOR


[Captioner] 20:28:32
THIS PRESENTATION.


[Captioner] 20:28:34
AND AT THIS TIME, I'D LIKE TO


[Captioner] 20:28:35
TURN IT BACK TO THE COUNCIL FOR


[Captioner] 20:28:37
ANY CLARIFYING QUESTIONS AND I'M


[Captioner] 20:28:38
SURE WE MAY HAVE SOME SPEAKERS


[Captioner] 20:28:41
ALSO ON THAT.


[Captioner] 20:28:48
>> Mayor Mei: COUNCILMEMBER


[Captioner] 20:28:48
CAMPBELL?


[Captioner] 20:28:49
>> Councilmember Campbell: I


[Captioner] 20:28:50
DO HAVE SOME QUESTIONS BUT DO WE


[Captioner] 20:28:52
NEED TO TAKE A BREAK FOR THE


[Captioner] 20:28:52
CAPTIONER?


[Captioner] 20:28:54
>> Mayor Mei: YES, WE DO NEED


[Captioner] 20:28:56
TO TAKE ONE AT 8:30 AND I GUESS


[Captioner] 20:28:58
WE WON'T BE DONE IN ONE MINUTE


[Captioner] 20:28:59
SO WHY DON'T WE GO AHEAD AND


[Captioner] 20:29:01
TAKE A 10-MINUTE BREAK AND WE'LL


[Captioner] 20:29:01
RETURN.


[Captioner] 20:29:02
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:30:10
[RECESS]


[Captioner] 20:39:58
[ RECE


[Captioner] 20:39:58
>> Councilmember Campbell:   


[Captioner] 20:39:59
THANK YOU FOR THIS GREAT 


[Captioner] 20:40:00
PRESENTATION.


[Captioner] 20:40:01
I JUST HAVE A COUPLE OF 


[Captioner] 20:40:03
QUESTIONS.


[Captioner] 20:40:05
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YOU 


[Captioner] 20:40:06
MENTIONED ON ONE OF THE SLIDES 


[Captioner] 20:40:09
HERE IS THAT PRIVATE DEVELOPMENT 


[Captioner] 20:40:10
REVENUE HAS DECLINED.


[Captioner] 20:40:12
AND I KNOW YOU'VE MENTIONED THAT 


[Captioner] 20:40:12
BEFORE.


[Captioner] 20:40:15
ARE WE SEEING ANY TRENDS GOING 


[Captioner] 20:40:16
UPWARD?


[Captioner] 20:40:21
I KNOW WE HAVE SOME LAND.


[Captioner] 20:40:24
I KNOW THERE'S A PARCEL AT 


[Captioner] 20:40:31
FREMONT BOULEVARD AND PASEO THAT 


[Captioner] 20:40:34
WAS SUPPOSED TO BE DEVELOPED ON, 


[Captioner] 20:40:34
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED WITH 


[Captioner] 20:40:36
THAT PROJECT THE THAT WAS 


[Captioner] 20:40:39
DELAYED OR -- IT'S AROUND ARTIST 


[Captioner] 20:40:40
WALK DOWN THE STREET FROM IT, 


[Captioner] 20:40:41
RATHER.


[Captioner] 20:40:44
>> Hans Larsen:   YEAH, I DON'T 


[Captioner] 20:40:46
KNOW IF IT'S PROBABLY OUR 


[Captioner] 20:40:47
COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT STAFF 


[Captioner] 20:40:49
WOULD BEST BE ABLE TO ADDRESS OR 


[Captioner] 20:40:51
WHAT THE FORECAST IS.


[Captioner] 20:40:52
I MEAN THEY'RE --


[Captioner] 20:40:54
>> Mayor Mei:   YOU'RE IMAGINING 


[Captioner] 20:40:57
THE FORMER SILICON SAGE SITE.


[Captioner] 20:41:01
IT'S UNDER RECEIVERSHIP.


[Captioner] 20:41:01
>> Councilmember Campbell:   


[Captioner] 20:41:03
NEVER MIND.


[Captioner] 20:41:05
A QUICK QUESTION ABOUT THE 


[Captioner] 20:41:05
FUNDING.


[Captioner] 20:41:07
IS THIS THE TOTAL FOR THE TWO 


[Captioner] 20:41:10
YEARS, OR IS THIS THE FIVE YEAR, 


[Captioner] 20:41:13
SIT GOING TO BE 296 MILLION FOR 


[Captioner] 20:41:14
FIVE YEARS?


[Captioner] 20:41:15
OKAY.


[Captioner] 20:41:17
WHAT IS THE ASK FOR THE TWO 


[Captioner] 20:41:19
YEARS THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE 


[Captioner] 20:41:25
APPROVING?


[Captioner] 20:41:27
>> Hans Larsen:   I MINE IT'S 


[Captioner] 20:41:28
GENERALLY ROUGHLY KIND OF -- SO 


[Captioner] 20:41:30
EACH YEAR IS SORT OF EQUAL 


[Captioner] 20:41:34
AMOUNT BUT I THINK MORE -- I CAN 


[Captioner] 20:41:36
LOOK UP THE NUMBER BUT IT'S 


[Captioner] 20:41:37
PROBABLY ABOUT 50% OF THAT 


[Captioner] 20:41:39
REVENUE.


[Captioner] 20:41:41
BECAUSE IT REFLECTS SORT OF 


[Captioner] 20:41:42
GRANT MONEYS THAT WE HAVE THAT 


[Captioner] 20:41:44
WE KNOW THAT WE'RE GETTING.


[Captioner] 20:41:46
AND SO WE HAVE MORE CERTAINTY IN 


[Captioner] 20:41:47
TERMS OF REVENUE IN THE FIRST 


[Captioner] 20:41:49
COUPLE OF YEARS THAN YEARS 3, 


[Captioner] 20:41:51
 4 


[Captioner] 20:41:52
AND 5.


[Captioner] 20:41:53
THERE'S KIND OF LESS CERTAINTY 


[Captioner] 20:41:55
IN TERMS OF FUTURE GRANTS THAT'S 


[Captioner] 20:41:56
BUILT IN THAT.


[Captioner] 20:41:58
SO IN KIND OF ROUGHER NUMBERS 


[Captioner] 20:42:00
IT'S ABOUT 50%.


[Captioner] 20:42:01
>> Councilmember Campbell:   50% 


[Captioner] 20:42:03
OF THE TOTAL ASK?


[Captioner] 20:42:05
FOR THE TWO YEARS?


[Captioner] 20:42:06
>> Hans Larsen:   IMRE, LET'S 


[Captioner] 20:42:14
SEE I THINK -- DIRECTOR 


[Captioner] 20:42:16
PERSSELIN HAS GOT THE NUMBER 


[Captioner] 20:42:19
HERE.


[Captioner] 20:42:20



[Captioner] 20:42:20
>> Hans Larsen:   SO LOOKING AT 


[Captioner] 20:42:23
THE FIRST YEAR BUDGET IS 65 


[Captioner] 20:42:25
MILLION AND YEAR 2 IS 56 MILLION 


[Captioner] 20:42:26
DOLLARS.


[Captioner] 20:42:26
>> Councilmember Campbell:   


[Captioner] 20:42:27
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:42:28
I DIDN'T SEE THAT.


[Captioner] 20:42:30
I PROBABLY OVERLOOKED IT THEN.


[Captioner] 20:42:34
REGARDING THE AUTO MALL PARKWAY 


[Captioner] 20:42:37
AND GRIMMER BOULEVARD, IS THAT 


[Captioner] 20:42:38
SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO BE 


[Captioner] 20:42:40
DONE IN THE FIRST AND SECOND 


[Captioner] 20:42:42
YEAR?


[Captioner] 20:42:43
>> THAT PROJECT IS CURRENTLY, 


[Captioner] 20:42:46
WE'RE SEEKING A GRANT FOR THAT.


[Captioner] 20:42:48
AND THE CITY WOULD BE -- THE 


[Captioner] 20:42:49
CITY'S PORTION WOULD BE A 


[Captioner] 20:42:50
MATCHING FURNITURE TO THAT.


[Captioner] 20:42:52
SO IF WE RECEIVED THE FEDERAL 


[Captioner] 20:42:53
APPROPRIATION THEN WE WOULD BE 


[Captioner] 20:42:56
ABLE TO BEGIN THE PROCESS OF 


[Captioner] 20:42:57
IMPLEMENTING THAT ONCE WE 


[Captioner] 20:42:59
RECEIVED THE TUNGD.


[Captioner] 20:43:00
>> Councilmember Campbell:   BUT 


[Captioner] 20:43:01
IS THE GOAL TO DO IT WITHIN THE 


[Captioner] 20:43:04
TWO-YEAR OR THE 75-YEAR?


[Captioner] 20:43:05
>> IT WOULD BE IN THE FIRST 


[Captioner] 20:43:06
SEVERAL YEARS, YES.


[Captioner] 20:43:07
>> Councilmember Campbell:   


[Captioner] 20:43:08
FIRST SEVERAL YEARS, THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:43:10
FOR THE INCREASE IN THE 50-50 


[Captioner] 20:43:14
TREE PROGRAM, DO YOU KNOW HOW 


[Captioner] 20:43:20
YOU ARE -- COMMUNITY MEMBERS 


[Captioner] 20:43:21
ACTUALLY UTILIZING THIS PROGRAM?


[Captioner] 20:43:25
THEREBY THE NECESSITY TO 


[Captioner] 20:43:26
INCREASE THE AMOUNT?


[Captioner] 20:43:27
>> THAT IS A GREAT QUESTION.


[Captioner] 20:43:29
THE COMMUNITY MEMBERS ARE FULLY 


[Captioner] 20:43:31
UTILIZING THE CURRENT PROGRAM.


[Captioner] 20:43:32
AND WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE AN 


[Captioner] 20:43:34
INCREASE IN USE IN THE PROGRAM.


[Captioner] 20:43:35
AND WE BELIEVE ONE OF THE 


[Captioner] 20:43:38
BARRIERS IS THAT THE FUNDING 


[Captioner] 20:43:40
AMOUNTS ARE VERY LOW, AND WE'VE 


[Captioner] 20:43:42
NOT INCREASED THE COLA OR COST 


[Captioner] 20:43:43
OF LIVING INCREASES OR THE TREE 


[Captioner] 20:43:45
COSTS THAT WE REALLY KNOW IT 


[Captioner] 20:43:46
COSTS OUT IN THE COMMUNITY AND 


[Captioner] 20:43:48
WE HAVE THOSE AMOUNTS.


[Captioner] 20:43:49
SO WE ARE LOOKING TO INCREASE 


[Captioner] 20:43:52
THE AMOUNT FROM $750 FOR A TREE 


[Captioner] 20:43:55
REIMBURSEMENT TO $1500 AND PILOT 


[Captioner] 20:43:57
THAT IN OUR FIRST YEAR TO SEE IF 


[Captioner] 20:43:58
THAT REALLY INCREASES THE USAGE 


[Captioner] 20:44:01
BY THE COMMUNITY FOR INCREASED 


[Captioner] 20:44:02
PRUNING AND REMOVAL AND 


[Captioner] 20:44:04
RESTORATION OF TREES IN OUR 


[Captioner] 20:44:04
COMMUNITY.


[Captioner] 20:44:07
IF NOT WE WILL COME BACK WITH A 


[Captioner] 20:44:08
DIFFERENT PROPOSAL TO AGAIN 


[Captioner] 20:44:11
CONTINUE TO REALLY INCREASE TREE 


[Captioner] 20:44:12
CONNECTIVITY AND TREES 


[Captioner] 20:44:14
IMPROVEMENTS IN OUR COMMUNITY.


[Captioner] 20:44:15
>> Councilmember Campbell:   


[Captioner] 20:44:18
OKAY, THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:44:19
ONE QUICK, ANOTHER QUICK 


[Captioner] 20:44:20
QUESTION.


[Captioner] 20:44:23
I'M LOOKING AT THE STREET REPAIR 


[Captioner] 20:44:24
PIECE THAT YOU MENTIONED.


[Captioner] 20:44:25
THESE SLIDES DON'T HAVE NUMBERS 


[Captioner] 20:44:28
ON THEM SO I'M SORRY I CAN'T 


[Captioner] 20:44:29
TELL YOU WHAT PAGE I'M LOOKING 


[Captioner] 20:44:30
AT.


[Captioner] 20:44:32
BUT IT DOES SHOW THAT WE WILL BE 


[Captioner] 20:44:35
WORKING WITH THRIEG TO PATCH 


[Captioner] 20:44:37
WHERE TREES HAVE LIFTED THE 


[Captioner] 20:44:43
CONCRETE UP.


[Captioner] 20:44:44
SO I THINK --


[Captioner] 20:44:45
>> Hans Larsen:   SO FOR THE 


[Captioner] 20:44:46
SIDEWALK REPAIRS?


[Captioner] 20:44:47
>> Councilmember Campbell:   


[Captioner] 20:44:47
YES.


[Captioner] 20:44:48
>> Hans Larsen:   THAT IS KIND 


[Captioner] 20:44:50
OF THE TYPICAL CASE WHERE THE 


[Captioner] 20:44:52
TREES HAVE CREATED THE LIFTING 


[Captioner] 20:44:53
OF THE SIDEWALK.


[Captioner] 20:44:53
>> Councilmember Campbell:   


[Captioner] 20:44:55
RIGHT SO MY QUESTION IS, WHAT 


[Captioner] 20:44:57
ARE YOU DOING TO ABATE THE ROOTS 


[Captioner] 20:44:59
OF THE TREES SO THIS DOESN'T 


[Captioner] 20:45:01
HAPPEN AGAIN?


[Captioner] 20:45:03
DO WE DO SOME TYPE OF ABATEMENT 


[Captioner] 20:45:07
FOR THAT, OR PULLING OUT ROOTS 


[Captioner] 20:45:11
OR GOD FORBID WE WOULD TEAR DOWN 


[Captioner] 20:45:12
THE TREE.


[Captioner] 20:45:12
>> Hans Larsen:   THERE'S KIND 


[Captioner] 20:45:14
OF A VARIETY OF THINGS.


[Captioner] 20:45:16
IT CAN INCLUDE REMOVING THE 


[Captioner] 20:45:18
TREE, PARTICULARLY IF IT'S OLD 


[Captioner] 20:45:20
OR DISEASED OR OFTENTIMES IT 


[Captioner] 20:45:22
JUST IS NOT THE RIGHT TYPE OF 


[Captioner] 20:45:24
TREE IN THAT LOCATION.


[Captioner] 20:45:26
BUT WE DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO 


[Captioner] 20:45:28
SAVE THE TREE.


[Captioner] 20:45:29
SO BUT WHEN THE SIDEWALK IS 


[Captioner] 20:45:33
REPAIRED, WE DO A ROOT PRUNING.


[Captioner] 20:45:36
AND SO ONCE THE OLD CONCRETE IS 


[Captioner] 20:45:38
REMOVED, THERE'S AN ASSESSMENT 


[Captioner] 20:45:41
DONE WITH THE TREE ARBORIST TO 


[Captioner] 20:45:43
DETERMINE IF THE ROOTS THAT 


[Captioner] 20:45:52
CAUSE THE DAMAGED CAN BE PRUNED 


[Captioner] 20:45:54
AND IF THAT'S THE CASE THE ROOTS 


[Captioner] 20:45:56
WILL BE PRUNED AND THE SIDEWALKS 


[Captioner] 20:45:58
WILL BE REPLACED AND THE ROOT 


[Captioner] 20:46:01
SYSTEM THAT CREATED THE DAMAGE 


[Captioner] 20:46:03
IN MAJORITY OF THE CASES WON'T 


[Captioner] 20:46:04
CONTINUE TO DO THAT.


[Captioner] 20:46:06
THERE ARE SOME ROOT BARRIERS 


[Captioner] 20:46:07
THAT CAN BE PLACED AS WELL.


[Captioner] 20:46:08
THIS IS PROBABLY SOMETHING 


[Captioner] 20:46:10
THAT'S DONE MORE WITH A YOUNG 


[Captioner] 20:46:11
TREE.


[Captioner] 20:46:12
WHEN YOU PLANT THE TREE 


[Captioner] 20:46:15
ORIGINALLY IN A WAY TO TRY TO 


[Captioner] 20:46:17
MINIMIZE SIDEWALK DAMAGE THERE 


[Captioner] 20:46:19
IS THINGS THAT CAN BE DONE FRO 


[Captioner] 20:46:25
 


[Captioner] 20:46:27
PROACTIVELY TO CAUSE LESS 


[Captioner] 20:46:28
DAMAGE.


[Captioner] 20:46:29
GETTING THE RIGHT TREE IN THE 


[Captioner] 20:46:30
RIGHT PLACE FROM THE BEGINNING 


[Captioner] 20:46:32
AND PART OF THE WORK WE'RE DOING 


[Captioner] 20:46:33
IS MAYBE CORRECTING THE BAD 


[Captioner] 20:46:35
DECISIONS THAT WERE MADE WITH 


[Captioner] 20:46:36
THE TYPE OF TREES THAT WERE 


[Captioner] 20:46:38
PLACED THERE.


[Captioner] 20:46:39
>> Councilmember Campbell:   MY 


[Captioner] 20:46:41
NEIGHBOR HAS A PROBLEM, 


[Captioner] 20:46:42
COMPLAINS TO ME ALL THE TIME 


[Captioner] 20:46:43
ABOUT THE ROOTS OF THE TREE AND 


[Captioner] 20:46:45
THE CITY NOT HELPING THEM OUT 


[Captioner] 20:46:47
AND I KEEP POINTING THEM TO THIS 


[Captioner] 20:46:49
50-50 PROGRAM BUT I DON'T KNOW 


[Captioner] 20:46:52
IF THEY'RE UTILIZING IT OR NOT.


[Captioner] 20:46:54
YOU MENTIONED ALSO ON THE CITY 


[Captioner] 20:46:57
BUILDING REHAB, THIS CITY HALL 


[Captioner] 20:46:58
BUILDING, ARE WE GOING TO GET 


[Captioner] 20:46:59
BETTER LIGHTING IN HERE?


[Captioner] 20:47:02
WHEN THE ROOF IS REPLACED?


[Captioner] 20:47:04
THIS SEEMS AT LEAST WHERE I AM 


[Captioner] 20:47:06
THERE IS NO LIGHT.


[Captioner] 20:47:08
NONE.


[Captioner] 20:47:10
SO THAT'S NOT IN THE PLAN, OKAY.


[Captioner] 20:47:12
I WAS JUST ASKING.


[Captioner] 20:47:15
I WAS DOING A PLUG FOR MY 


[Captioner] 20:47:16
SEATING AREA HERE.


[Captioner] 20:47:21
(LAUGHING) OKAY I THINK I'M DONE 


[Captioner] 20:47:21
NOW, THANK YOU SO MUCH.


[Captioner] 20:47:24
>> Mayor Mei:   THANKS FOR THE 


[Captioner] 20:47:26
CLARIFYING QUESTIONS.


[Captioner] 20:47:27
WE'LL HAVE TO COME UP WITH NEW 


[Captioner] 20:47:29
LIGHTING OR SOMETHING, OPTIONS.


[Captioner] 20:47:31
THIS LOOKS PRETTY MUCH THE SAME 


[Captioner] 20:47:32
LIGHTING AS WHEN I SAT HERE A 


[Captioner] 20:47:34
FEW YEAR AGO, ACTUALLY MORE THAN 


[Captioner] 20:47:36
A FEW YEAR AGO.


[Captioner] 20:47:37
BUT NEXT FOR CLARIFYING 


[Captioner] 20:47:39
QUESTIONS, COUNCILMEMBER KENG.


[Captioner] 20:47:42
>> Councilmember Keng:   I 


[Captioner] 20:47:44
ACTUALLY DON'T HAVE ANY MORE 


[Captioner] 20:47:47
QUESTIONS BUT DO I HAVE SOME 


[Captioner] 20:47:47
COMMENTS.


[Captioner] 20:47:48
>> Mayor Mei:   GO AHEAD.


[Captioner] 20:47:51
WE ALSO TO LET YOU KNOW WE HAVE 


[Captioner] 20:47:54
SOME SPEAKER CARDS TOO, IS THAT 


[Captioner] 20:47:57
CORRECT -- WE SHOULD STICK TO 


[Captioner] 20:47:57
CLARIFYING QUESTIONS AND THEN WE 


[Captioner] 20:47:59
HAVE A FEW SPEAKERS BEFORE WE 


[Captioner] 20:48:01
RETURN TO COMMENTS.


[Captioner] 20:48:02
CLARIFYING QUESTIONS VICE MAYOR 


[Captioner] 20:48:05
COX, WE HAVE SOME SPEAKERS JUST 


[Captioner] 20:48:07
TO LET YOU KNOW BEFORE COMMENTS.


[Captioner] 20:48:07
>> Vice Mayor Cox:   THANK YOU 


[Captioner] 20:48:09
VERY MUCH AND I REALLY 


[Captioner] 20:48:11
APPRECIATE WHEN LOOK AT THE CIP 


[Captioner] 20:48:13
YOU'RE TOUCHING BUILDINGS YOU'RE 


[Captioner] 20:48:14
TOUCHING PARKS AND TRAFFIC.


[Captioner] 20:48:16
ALL OF THAT KIND OF RESONATES 


[Captioner] 20:48:18
WITH THE RESIDENTS OF FREMONT 


[Captioner] 20:48:20
THAT HEM IMPROVE IN THE QUALITY 


[Captioner] 20:48:23
OF LIFE OF LIVING HERE -- THAT 


[Captioner] 20:48:24
HELP IMPROVE IN THE QUALITY OF 


[Captioner] 20:48:26
LIFE IN LIVING HERE .


[Captioner] 20:48:29
ONE OF THE THINGS IN GENERAL I'D 


[Captioner] 20:48:29
 


[Captioner] 20:48:32
KIND OF ASK IN GENERAL LOOKING 


[Captioner] 20:48:34
AT THE WHOLE CIP PROGRAM IS THAT 


[Captioner] 20:48:36
AS YOU'RE REPLACING LIKE THE 


[Captioner] 20:48:38
HVAC SYSTEMS I KNOW YOU HAD 


[Captioner] 20:48:40
MENTIONED 11 BUILDINGS.


[Captioner] 20:48:41
ARE YOU ALSO INCLUDING SOME SORT 


[Captioner] 20:48:43
OF AIR FILTERING OR MONITORING 


[Captioner] 20:48:47
THAT KIND OF PURIFIES THE AIR AS 


[Captioner] 20:48:48
PART OF WHAT YOU'RE THINKING 


[Captioner] 20:48:51
WHEN YOU'RE GOING TO BE 


[Captioner] 20:48:52
PURCHASING EVENTUALLY AS WE GET 


[Captioner] 20:48:54
GRANTS AND OTHER FUNDING 


[Captioner] 20:48:55
SOURCES, THAT SOME OF YOUR 


[Captioner] 20:48:56
VISION?


[Captioner] 20:48:58
I JUST WANTED TO KIND OF CLARIFY 


[Captioner] 20:48:59
THAT PART.


[Captioner] 20:49:00
>> Hans Larsen:   YES.


[Captioner] 20:49:02
CERTAINLY AS WE REPLACE THE 


[Captioner] 20:49:04
SYSTEMS WE WILL, YOU KNOW, 


[Captioner] 20:49:06
REPLACE THEM WITH, YOU KNOW, 


[Captioner] 20:49:08
WHAT'S SORT OF THE BETTS 


[Captioner] 20:49:10
PRACTICES ARE AS FAR AS AIR 


[Captioner] 20:49:11
QUALITY, ENERGY EFFICIENCY, 


[Captioner] 20:49:14
REDUCING FUTURE MAINTENANCE 


[Captioner] 20:49:15
EXPENSES.


[Captioner] 20:49:17
SO THAT'S PART OF KIND OF THE 


[Captioner] 20:49:17
STANDARD PROCESS THAT WE'LL 


[Captioner] 20:49:18
HAVE.


[Captioner] 20:49:20
I THINK, YOU KNOW, IN TERMS OF 


[Captioner] 20:49:23
AS WE WERE LOOKING AT SORT OF 


[Captioner] 20:49:24
MANAGING ISSUES WITH COVID AND 


[Captioner] 20:49:28
THE QUALITY OF THE AIR WAS A -- 


[Captioner] 20:49:29
IS AN IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION.


[Captioner] 20:49:31
THERE ARE A LOT OF LIMITATIONS 


[Captioner] 20:49:33
IN TERMS OF WHAT WE COULD DO, 


[Captioner] 20:49:35
GIVEN AGE OF THE EQUIPMENT THAT 


[Captioner] 20:49:36
WE HAD.


[Captioner] 20:49:37
BUT, YOU KNOW, WE DID THE BEST 


[Captioner] 20:49:40
WE CAN WITH WHAT WE HAD.


[Captioner] 20:49:43
BUT CERTAINLY BY REPLACING THESE 


[Captioner] 20:49:45
SYSTEMS WE'LL BE ABLE TO DO MORE 


[Captioner] 20:49:47
IN THE FUTURE.


[Captioner] 20:49:48
>> Vice Mayor Cox:   OKAY.


[Captioner] 20:49:49
THANK YOU VERY MUCH ON THAT.


[Captioner] 20:49:51
I HAVE A COUPLE OF OTHER 


[Captioner] 20:49:52
FOLLOW-UPS.


[Captioner] 20:49:55
I NOTICE, WELL WE HAD TALKED 


[Captioner] 20:49:57
ABOUT THE SIDEWALK AND I INTHAT 


[Captioner] 20:50:01
 KNOW 


[Captioner] 20:50:03
THAT FOR A WHILE HAD YOU KIND OF 


[Captioner] 20:50:04
A SIDEWALK LIST.


[Captioner] 20:50:06
KIND EVER WALKING THROUGH THAT 


[Captioner] 20:50:08
YOU ARE GOING TO BE ADDING NEW 


[Captioner] 20:50:08
STAFFING.


[Captioner] 20:50:11
AS THE -- WITH THE NEW SIDEWALK 


[Captioner] 20:50:12
I'M SURE THERE'S PROBABLY MORE 


[Captioner] 20:50:14
THAT HAVE BEEN ADDED WITH THE 


[Captioner] 20:50:16
STORM WEATHER AND EVERYTHING.


[Captioner] 20:50:17
SO WOULD WE BE ABLE TO GET 


[Captioner] 20:50:21
THROUGH WITH THE NEW CREW A LOT 


[Captioner] 20:50:24
OF THE SIDEWALK LIST OVER TIME?


[Captioner] 20:50:25
BECAUSE I DON'T -- I HAVEN'T 


[Captioner] 20:50:28
HEARD MUCH ABOUT HOW THAT'S 


[Captioner] 20:50:29
STILL PENDING IN REGARDS TO HOW 


[Captioner] 20:50:32
IT ROLLS INTO OUR BUDGET FOR 


[Captioner] 20:50:33
THIS COMING YEAR.


[Captioner] 20:50:34
OR THE NEXT TWO YEARS.


[Captioner] 20:50:36
>> Hans Larsen:   YES, I MEAN 


[Captioner] 20:50:38
SIDEWALKS WEREN'T REALLY SORT OF 


[Captioner] 20:50:40
TOO AFFECTED BY STORMS.


[Captioner] 20:50:42
WE HAD A LOT MORE POTHOLES SO 


[Captioner] 20:50:44
THERE IS A LOT OF BACKLOG OF 


[Captioner] 20:50:46
PAVEMENT WORK TO BE DONE AND 


[Captioner] 20:50:47
CERTAINLY HAVING MORE STAFF 


[Captioner] 20:50:50
RESOURCES ALLOWS US TO BE MORE 


[Captioner] 20:50:51
RESPONSIVE IN DEALING WITH, YOU 


[Captioner] 20:50:53
KNOW, A VARIETY OF STORM ISSUES 


[Captioner] 20:50:54
WITH THE COMMUNITY.


[Captioner] 20:50:57
BUT ALSO THEN REPAIRING THE 


[Captioner] 20:50:58
INFRASTRUCTURE LIKE PAVEMENT.


[Captioner] 20:51:01
WITH REGARDS TO SIDEWALKS, WE'VE 


[Captioner] 20:51:03
LARGELY BEEN LIMITED WITH THE 


[Captioner] 20:51:05
FUNDING THAT WE'VE HAD TO FOCUS 


[Captioner] 20:51:07
ON WHAT WE REFER TO AS KIND OF 


[Captioner] 20:51:09
THE WORST FIRST.


[Captioner] 20:51:11
AND ILLEGALITIES DEAL WITH THE 


[Captioner] 20:51:13
WORST SIDEWALK DEFLECTIONS AND 


[Captioner] 20:51:15
THEN HAVE A PROGRAM.


[Captioner] 20:51:16
AND GENERALLY WE WOULD TAKE CARE 


[Captioner] 20:51:19
OF THE HUNDRED WORST LOCATIONS 


[Captioner] 20:51:21
YOU KNOW EVERY YEAR IN THE CITY.


[Captioner] 20:51:23
IT'S TAKEN US ABOUT, YOU KNOW, 


[Captioner] 20:51:24
SIX YEARS TO KIND OF GET THROUGH 


[Captioner] 20:51:28
THE LIST OF THE REALLY BAD ONES.


[Captioner] 20:51:30
BUT PART OF OUR MESSAGE IS, IS 


[Captioner] 20:51:32
THAT WITHIN THE NEXT TWO YEARS 


[Captioner] 20:51:36
ALL OF WHAT WE CLASSIFIED AS 


[Captioner] 20:51:40
HAVING THE MOST SEVERAL DAMAGED 


[Captioner] 20:51:43
 SEVERELY DAMAGED 


[Captioner] 20:51:46
SIDEWALKS IS THE ONES WE'LL BE 


[Captioner] 20:51:49
ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF, WHAT THE 


[Captioner] 20:51:50
COMMUNITY COMPLAINS THE MOST 


[Captioner] 20:51:51
ABOUT.


[Captioner] 20:51:53
WHAT WE'LL BE ABLE TO DO AND 


[Captioner] 20:51:54
CERTAINLY THE LEVEL OF FUNDING 


[Captioner] 20:51:56
THAT WE HAVE DOESN'T FIX ALL OF 


[Captioner] 20:51:57
OUR SIDEWALKS BUT WE WILL BE 


[Captioner] 20:52:01
ABLE TO MOVE INTO A NEW 


[Captioner] 20:52:02
CLASSIFICATION OF SIDEWALKS 


[Captioner] 20:52:04
WHERE THERE'S SORT OF MODERATE 


[Captioner] 20:52:06
DAMAGE GENERALLY IN THE TWO TO 


[Captioner] 20:52:07
FOUR INCH DEFLECTION.


[Captioner] 20:52:08
SO THEY'VE BEEN PATCHED.


[Captioner] 20:52:09
THEY DON'T LOOK GOOD.


[Captioner] 20:52:12
THE PATCHES DON'T LAST FOREVER 


[Captioner] 20:52:13
BUT WE'LL BE ABLE TO GET AFTER 


[Captioner] 20:52:14
THOSE.


[Captioner] 20:52:16
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE EXPECT 


[Captioner] 20:52:20
TO HEAR FROM THE COMMUNITY, WHEN 


[Captioner] 20:52:22
WE DO A NEW ACTIVE 


[Captioner] 20:52:23
TRANSPORTATION PLAN, IS 


[Captioner] 20:52:25
CONDITION OF SIDEWALKS THAT MAY 


[Captioner] 20:52:28
BE OF CONCERN TO OUR SENIOR 


[Captioner] 20:52:30
COMMUNITY AS THEY WALK TO SENIOR 


[Captioner] 20:52:32
CENTER OR ACCESSING TRANSIT.


[Captioner] 20:52:36
AND SO WE'RE REALLY PLEASED TO 


[Captioner] 20:52:37
HAVE THE PROPOSED ADDITIONAL 


[Captioner] 20:52:42
RESOURCES AND OUR OWN CREWS THAT 


[Captioner] 20:52:43
CAN ADDRESS SOME OF THESE AS 


[Captioner] 20:52:45
THEY COME UP.


[Captioner] 20:52:46
SO WE'LL BE A LOT MORE 


[Captioner] 20:52:47
RESPONSIVE IN DEALING WITH KIND 


[Captioner] 20:52:49
OF HIGH PRIORITY CONCERNS THAT 


[Captioner] 20:52:50
WE HEAR FROM THE COMMUNITY.


[Captioner] 20:52:52
SO WE'LL PROVIDE BETTER SERVICE, 


[Captioner] 20:52:55
BE MORE RESPONSIVE BUT I DON'T 


[Captioner] 20:52:57
WANT, YOU KNOW, COUNCIL TO 


[Captioner] 20:52:58
THINK, YOU KNOW, WE'VE SOLVED 


[Captioner] 20:53:00
THE SIDEWALK REPAIR ISSUE.


[Captioner] 20:53:03
WE WILL CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN THE 


[Captioner] 20:53:05
50-50 GRANT PROGRAM FOR SIDEWALK 


[Captioner] 20:53:06
REPAIRS.


[Captioner] 20:53:09
SO IF IT ISN'T ON OUR LIST AS A 


[Captioner] 20:53:11
PRIORITY, BUT A PROPERTY OWNER 


[Captioner] 20:53:13
WANTS TO FIRM THEIR SIDEWALK, WE 


[Captioner] 20:53:14
CONTINUE TO HAVE, YOU KNOW, 


[Captioner] 20:53:20
RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO ASSIST 


[Captioner] 20:53:21
THEM WITH THAT.


[Captioner] 20:53:22
>> Vice Mayor Cox:   OKAY THAT'S 


[Captioner] 20:53:23
GOOD.


[Captioner] 20:53:24
THE PICTURE YOU SHOWED ON THE 


[Captioner] 20:53:26
TEEN CENTER IS IT LIKE A TWO 


[Captioner] 20:53:28
STORY BUILDING YOU'RE LOOKING AT 


[Captioner] 20:53:30
DOING OR IS IT JUST ONE STORY?


[Captioner] 20:53:33
DOES IT HAVE STORAGE ON TOP?


[Captioner] 20:53:35
IT LOOKS LIKE TWO STORIES, IT'S 


[Captioner] 20:53:39
JUST ONE STORY AND HAVE A HIGHER 


[Captioner] 20:53:39
CEILING.


[Captioner] 20:53:41
>> WHAT YOU SEIZE IS A CONCEPT 


[Captioner] 20:53:43
PLAN, IT IS IN DESIGN.


[Captioner] 20:53:45
WE ARE CURRENTLY GOING THROUGH 


[Captioner] 20:53:46
AN RFP PROCESS WHERE WE ARE 


[Captioner] 20:53:48
SELECTING A SPECIFIC PROPOSAL TO 


[Captioner] 20:53:50
DO THE DESIGN WORK FOR THE 


[Captioner] 20:53:51
COMMUNITY CENTER.


[Captioner] 20:53:52
AT THAT TIME WE'LL COME BACK TO 


[Captioner] 20:53:53
YOU WITH THE ACTUAL DESIGN AND 


[Captioner] 20:53:54
WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE.


[Captioner] 20:53:56
THIS IS A CONCEPT PLAN OF WHAT 


[Captioner] 20:53:57
WE THOUGHT WE WOULD BUILD BASED 


[Captioner] 20:54:00
ON THE FUNDING WE HAD AND BASED 


[Captioner] 20:54:02
ON THE AMENITIES AND SERVICES 


[Captioner] 20:54:04
THAT THE PEOPLE ASKED FOR.


[Captioner] 20:54:06
THAT DESIGN CONCEPT HELPED 


[Captioner] 20:54:08
PRESENT THAT FOR FUNDING AND FOR 


[Captioner] 20:54:10
OPPORTUNITIES FOR PRIVATE 


[Captioner] 20:54:12
FUNDING AND OTHER OPPORTUNITIES 


[Captioner] 20:54:13
AS THEY COME FORWARD TO GET US 


[Captioner] 20:54:15
MOVING FORWARD AS WE 


[Captioner] 20:54:16
CONCURRENTLY GO THROUGH PROCESS 


[Captioner] 20:54:18
TO HIRE A SPECIFIC PERSON OR 


[Captioner] 20:54:20
FIRM TO HELP US DESIGN THE 


[Captioner] 20:54:21
FACILITY.


[Captioner] 20:54:22
>> Vice Mayor Cox:   OKAY, I 


[Captioner] 20:54:26
APPRECIATE THAT EXPLANATION AND 


[Captioner] 20:54:28
BASICALLY IT'S DRAFT AND THAT IS 


[Captioner] 20:54:30
FOR AS BEING ABLE TO GET THE 


[Captioner] 20:54:32
SERVICES GOING FOR WHAT YOU NEED 


[Captioner] 20:54:33
TO START THE PROJECT.


[Captioner] 20:54:35
THE OTHER THING WAS THAT WITH 


[Captioner] 20:54:37
THE NEW TECHNOLOGY THAT'S COMING 


[Captioner] 20:54:40
OUT IN TERMS OF TOUCHLESS, 


[Captioner] 20:54:41
TOUCHLESS THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO 


[Captioner] 20:54:45
TOUCH LIKE THE -- YOU KNOW, THE 


[Captioner] 20:54:46
PEDESTRIAN STREET TRAFFIC YOU 


[Captioner] 20:54:47
DON'T HAVE TO TOUCH GOING INTO 


[Captioner] 20:54:50
THE PUBLIC BATHROOMS.


[Captioner] 20:54:51
AND I WAS REALLY PLEASED TO SEE 


[Captioner] 20:54:53
THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE UPGRADING 


[Captioner] 20:54:56
AND REPLACING THE 21 RESTROOMS 


[Captioner] 20:54:59
IN THE PARKS WHICH HAS BEEN 


[Captioner] 20:55:00
SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN NOTED IN A 


[Captioner] 20:55:02
LOT OF THE DIFFERENT PARKS.


[Captioner] 20:55:05
ONE OF THE THINGS IS THAT WILL 


[Captioner] 20:55:06
THAT BE CONSIDERING SOME OF THE 


[Captioner] 20:55:09
THINGS AS WE'RE LOOKING AT THE 


[Captioner] 20:55:10
CIP PROGRAM THAT IT'S GOING TO 


[Captioner] 20:55:13
HAVE SOME OF THAT NEW 


[Captioner] 20:55:15
TECHNOLOGY, WITH TOUCHLESS TO BE 


[Captioner] 20:55:18
ABLE TO GAIN ENTRY IN AND OUT.


[Captioner] 20:55:20
I'VE BEEN VERY BLESSED TO BE IN 


[Captioner] 20:55:22
A BRAND-NEW BUILDING THAT I JUST 


[Captioner] 20:55:24
MOVED INTO ABOUT A MONTH AGO, 


[Captioner] 20:55:25
THAT IT'S JUST TOUCHLESS, YOU 


[Captioner] 20:55:27
DON'T HAVE TO TOUCH ANYTHING, IT 


[Captioner] 20:55:29
JUST OPENS AUTOMATICALLY.


[Captioner] 20:55:30
>> Hans Larsen:   YES THAT'S 


[Captioner] 20:55:31
DEFINITELY SOMETHING WE'RE 


[Captioner] 20:55:32
LOOKING AT.


[Captioner] 20:55:33
SO WE HAVE A PROJECT AT 


[Captioner] 20:55:35
CONSTRUCTION RIGHT NOW AT THE 


[Captioner] 20:55:37
FAMILY RESOURCE CENTER AND THEIR 


[Captioner] 20:55:39
RESTROOMS HAVE ALL TOUCHLESS YOU 


[Captioner] 20:55:43
KNOW WATER, SOAP, TOWMS OPENING.


[Captioner] 20:55:46
 TOWELS 


[Captioner] 20:55:46
OPENING.


[Captioner] 20:55:48
AND THEN WE'RE ALSO GOING TO BE 


[Captioner] 20:55:50
DOING A PROJECT THIS COMING YEAR 


[Captioner] 20:55:52
FOR CITY HALL, FOR THE PUBLIC 


[Captioner] 20:55:54
RESTROOMS HERE THAT WE'RE GOING 


[Captioner] 20:55:56
TO BE USING SORT OF TOUCHLESS 


[Captioner] 20:55:58
TECHNOLOGY.


[Captioner] 20:55:59
YOU KNOW, IT'S A -- THERE IS A 


[Captioner] 20:56:02
LOT OF DIFFERENT VARIATIONS OF 


[Captioner] 20:56:04
IT AS YOU HAVE PROBABLY SEEN, 


[Captioner] 20:56:07
SOME WORK BETTER THAN OTHERS BUT 


[Captioner] 20:56:09
IT'S DEFINITELY I THINK TREND 


[Captioner] 20:56:11
AND THE BEST PRACTICE.


[Captioner] 20:56:13
SO WE'RE LOOKING TO MAKE THOSE 


[Captioner] 20:56:13
INVESTMENTS.


[Captioner] 20:56:15
AS WE DO SOME PROJECTS, TEST 


[Captioner] 20:56:17
THEM OUT AND HOPEFULLY THE 


[Captioner] 20:56:18
COMMUNITY AND OUR EMPLOYEES 


[Captioner] 20:56:20
RESPOND WELL TO THEM, WE'LL 


[Captioner] 20:56:22
LEARN, YOU KNOW, WHAT WORKS WELL 


[Captioner] 20:56:24
AND USE THAT FOR FUTURE 


[Captioner] 20:56:24
PROJECTS.


[Captioner] 20:56:25
>> Vice Mayor Cox:   THAT SOUNDS 


[Captioner] 20:56:27
GREAT, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR 


[Captioner] 20:56:29
ANSWERING MY QUESTIONS AND I 


[Captioner] 20:56:30
LOOK FORWARD TO BEING ABLE TO 


[Captioner] 20:56:31
MOVE FORWARD WITH ALL OF THIS.


[Captioner] 20:56:32
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:56:33
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU, 


[Captioner] 20:56:34
CLARIFYING QUESTIONS, 


[Captioner] 20:56:35
COUNCILMEMBER SHAO.


[Captioner] 20:56:36
>> Councilmember Shao:   THANK 


[Captioner] 20:56:37
YOU, MADAM MAYOR.


[Captioner] 20:56:43
I'M LOOKING AT THE BINDER PAGE 


[Captioner] 20:56:45
NUMBER 94.


[Captioner] 20:56:48
WHICH REFERS TO TRAFFIC SIGNAL 


[Captioner] 20:56:50
MODERNIZATION.


[Captioner] 20:56:53
AND I WAS LITTLE BIT CONFUSED BY 


[Captioner] 20:56:58
ONE COLUMN WHICH SAYS 2024/25.


[Captioner] 20:57:00
AND THE NUMBER LISTED THERE IS 


[Captioner] 20:57:04
ZERO FROM TOP TO BOTTOM.


[Captioner] 20:57:06
SO COMBINING WITH YOUR REPORT 


[Captioner] 20:57:10
USING THE SLIDES, COULD YOU JUST 


[Captioner] 20:57:12
GIVE ME MORE EXPLANATION AS TO 


[Captioner] 20:57:16
WHAT THE NUMBERS ARE, AND HOW 


[Captioner] 20:57:20
CAN THEY CORRELATE WITH YOUR 


[Captioner] 20:57:24
REPORT JUST NOW ON ONE OF YOUR 


[Captioner] 20:57:26
SLIDES REGARDING TRAFFIC SIGNAL 


[Captioner] 20:57:31
MODERNIZATION?


[Captioner] 20:57:32
>> Hans Larsen:   I THINK I SIGH 


[Captioner] 20:57:34
WHAT YOU SEE, ARE SEEING HERE.


[Captioner] 20:57:38
I THINK IF YOU ALSO FLIP OVER TO 


[Captioner] 20:57:41
PAGE 91, THEN THERE'S KIND OF MY 


[Captioner] 20:57:43
ANSWER HERE IS THAT WE DO HAVE A 


[Captioner] 20:57:46
LOT OF DIFFERENT FUNDING SOURCES 


[Captioner] 20:57:48
WITH TRAFFIC SIGNAL MOD 


[Captioner] 20:57:52
 


[Captioner] 20:57:53
MODERNIZATION AND WE HAVE BEEN 


[Captioner] 20:57:56
ABLE TO GET SOME GRANTS AND WE 


[Captioner] 20:57:57
ARE SUPPLEMENTING IT WITH MONEY 


[Captioner] 20:57:58
FROM DIFFERENT SOURCES.


[Captioner] 20:58:02
THE INTENT IS WE HAVE A PROGRAM 


[Captioner] 20:58:03
THAT WE ARE INCREASING 


[Captioner] 20:58:04
INVESTMENT IN.


[Captioner] 20:58:06
SO JUST KIND OF A QUICK ANSWER 


[Captioner] 20:58:07
IF YOU KIND OF LOOK AT FILLING 


[Captioner] 20:58:11
IN THE GAPS, SO THE TRAFFIC 


[Captioner] 20:58:13
IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM LISTED ON 


[Captioner] 20:58:16
PAGE 91 HAS $1.8 MILLION 


[Captioner] 20:58:18
INVESTMENT IN YEAR 2.


[Captioner] 20:58:21
WHICH KIND OF FILLS THE GAP THAT 


[Captioner] 20:58:23
IS SHOWN IN THE TRAFFIC SIGNAL 


[Captioner] 20:58:25
SYSTEM UPGRADE AND MODERNIZATION 


[Captioner] 20:58:25
PROGRAM.


[Captioner] 20:58:28
IF YOU TAKE BOTH OF THOSE AND 


[Captioner] 20:58:29
COMBINE THEM TOGETHER, YOU'LL 


[Captioner] 20:58:35
SEE THAT, YOU KNOW, WE'VE GOT A 


[Captioner] 20:58:40
 


[Captioner] 20:58:43
CONTINUAL LEVEL OF SIGNAL 


[Captioner] 20:58:45
MODERNIZATION.


[Captioner] 20:58:45
>> Councilmember Shao:   WHAT IS 


[Captioner] 20:58:51
THE TIME LINE ON THE SIGNALIZED 


[Captioner] 20:58:56
PASEO PADRE AND MOWRY, WHAT IS 


[Captioner] 20:58:57
YOUR ESTIMATE OF COMPLETION?


[Captioner] 20:58:58
>> Hans Larsen:   THE WORK ON 


[Captioner] 20:59:01
PASEO PADRE PARKWAY NORTH OF 


[Captioner] 20:59:04
MOWRY IS COMPLETE AND IT IS 


[Captioner] 20:59:05
ACTUALLY QUITE REMARKABLE.


[Captioner] 20:59:07
THAT IF YOU GET IN THAT CORRIDOR 


[Captioner] 20:59:10
YOU WILL BE ABLE TO GO THROUGH 


[Captioner] 20:59:13
THE SIGNALS BASICALLY IN A 


[Captioner] 20:59:15
PLATOON, TRAVELING AT A 


[Captioner] 20:59:17
REASONABLE SPEED, BUT YOU WILL 


[Captioner] 20:59:20
BE ABLE TO GET THROUGH PROBABLY 


[Captioner] 20:59:24
ABOUT TEN TRAFFIC SIGNALS, GET 


[Captioner] 20:59:25
THROUGH ALL OF THEM ON A GREEN 


[Captioner] 20:59:27
PHASE OR MAYBE HIT ONE OR TWO 


[Captioner] 20:59:31
PHASES WHERE, WITHIN LIKE 20 


[Captioner] 20:59:33
SECONDS IT'S TURNING GREEN.


[Captioner] 20:59:35
AND SO THE WORK OF OUR STAFF 


[Captioner] 20:59:36
TEAM BOTH WITH THE TECHNOLOGY 


[Captioner] 20:59:38
AND THE TIMING IS REALLY BEEN 


[Captioner] 20:59:40
QUITE REMARKABLE.


[Captioner] 20:59:41
WE'RE COLLECTING DATA TO BE ABLE 


[Captioner] 20:59:44
TO KIND OF MAKE THE CASE ON HOW 


[Captioner] 20:59:46
MUCH TRAVEL TIME IS BEING SAVED.


[Captioner] 20:59:49
AND SO THAT KIND OF OUR TWO TEST 


[Captioner] 20:59:50
CORRIDORS HAVE BEEN ON PASEO 


[Captioner] 20:59:53
PADRE NORTH OF MOWRY AND FREMONT 


[Captioner] 20:59:54
BOULEVARD.


[Captioner] 20:59:56
AND THEN AS WE KIND OF REFINE 


[Captioner] 20:59:59
THE TECHNOLOGY, AND OUR STAFF 


[Captioner] 21:00:00
EXPERTISE WE'RE GOING TO BE 


[Captioner] 21:00:02
QUICKLY ROLLING THAT OUT TO A 


[Captioner] 21:00:03
LOT OF THE OTHER MAJOR STREETS.


[Captioner] 21:00:05
OUR GOAL IS TO, YOU KNOW, HAVE 


[Captioner] 21:00:08
ALL OF OUR MAJOR STREETS 


[Captioner] 21:00:09
COMPLETED IN THE NEXT, YOU KNOW, 


[Captioner] 21:00:11
THREE YEARS.


[Captioner] 21:00:12
>> Councilmember Shao:   OKAY, 


[Captioner] 21:00:13
THANK YOU, THANK YOU SO MUCH 


[Captioner] 21:00:15
THAT'S WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR, 


[Captioner] 21:00:16
THANK YOU AND CONGRATULATIONS ON 


[Captioner] 21:00:18
YOUR GOOD WORK.


[Captioner] 21:00:19
>> Hans Larsen:   THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 21:00:19
>> City Attorney Levine:   THANK 


[Captioner] 21:00:22



[Captioner] 21:00:23
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU, I'LL 


[Captioner] 21:00:25
TURN IT OVER TO THE COMMENTS AND 


[Captioner] 21:00:26
SPEAKERS AT THIS TIME.


[Captioner] 21:00:27
AND IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN 


[Captioner] 21:00:31
ADDRESSING THE CIP WHICH IS LIKE 


[Captioner] 21:00:34
THE INFRASTRUCTURE PRODUCT, 


[Captioner] 21:00:35
COMMUNITY INFRASTRUCTURE -- 


[Captioner] 21:00:37
CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS 


[Captioner] 21:00:38
PLEASE AT THIS TIME TURN IN A 


[Captioner] 21:00:40
CARD OR RAISE YOUR HAND ON ZOOM.


[Captioner] 21:00:41
I JUST WANTED TO ANNOUNCE IT 


[Captioner] 21:00:42
EVERY TIME.


[Captioner] 21:00:44
>> The Clerk:   YES, IN PERSON 


[Captioner] 21:00:49
WE HAVE DANIEL KERPELOVICH 


[Captioner] 21:00:50
FOLLOWED BY ANNIE.


[Captioner] 21:01:01
>> HI, SO FIRST OF ALL, THANK 


[Captioner] 21:01:04
YOU FOR THIS FANTASTIC 


[Captioner] 21:01:05
PRESENTATION.


[Captioner] 21:01:06
I MOSTLY SUPPORT EVERYTHING THAT 


[Captioner] 21:01:08
IS GOING ON HERE.


[Captioner] 21:01:10
OBVIOUSLY, WE NEED INVESTMENT 


[Captioner] 21:01:14
AND MORE INVESTMENT INTO ALL OF 


[Captioner] 21:01:15
THESE PROJECTS.


[Captioner] 21:01:18
BUT I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT 


[Captioner] 21:01:20
THAT WHETHER WE'RE TALKING ABOUT 


[Captioner] 21:01:23
BIKE AND PEDESTRIAN PROJECTS, 


[Captioner] 21:01:25
AND MULTIMODAL CORRIDORS WE 


[Captioner] 21:01:27
REALLY NEED TO FOCUS ON THE 


[Captioner] 21:01:29
CORRIDOR ASPECT OF IT.


[Captioner] 21:01:31
HAVING JUST ISOLATED PROJECTS 


[Captioner] 21:01:33
THAT DON'T CONNECT TO EACH OTHER 


[Captioner] 21:01:36
IS NOT A GOOD USE OF OUR MONEY.


[Captioner] 21:01:39
IT IS NOT AN 77 WAY OF PROVIDING 


[Captioner] 21:01:41
FOR SAFE CYCLING OR SAFE WALKING 


[Captioner] 21:01:44
OR EVEN SAFE DRIVING RIGHT?


[Captioner] 21:01:47
IF YOU HAVE A BIKE LANE THAT 


[Captioner] 21:01:48
ENDS HALFWAY THROUGH A BLOCK OR 


[Captioner] 21:01:50
IF IT -- YOU KNOW, YOU WOULDN'T 


[Captioner] 21:01:53
HAVE A CAR LANE THAT LIKE 


[Captioner] 21:01:54
SUDDENLY GOES FROM A HIGHWAY TO 


[Captioner] 21:01:55
A GRAVEL ROAD.


[Captioner] 21:01:56
YOU HAVE A CORRIDOR.


[Captioner] 21:01:58
SO WE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE 


[Captioner] 21:02:00
ARE FOCUSING ON, YOU KNOW, 


[Captioner] 21:02:02
PROVIDING FOR THOSE CONNECTIONS 


[Captioner] 21:02:05
BETWEEN EXISTING PROJECTS.


[Captioner] 21:02:08
AND PART OF THAT IS OBVIOUSLY 


[Captioner] 21:02:09
ROADS BUT ALSO THE TRAILS, 


[Captioner] 21:02:09
RIGHT?


[Captioner] 21:02:12
SO THE PACIFIC COMMONS AREA 


[Captioner] 21:02:14
COULD USE MUCH MORE IMPROVEMENT 


[Captioner] 21:02:18
THIS THOSE TRAILS AND ALSO THE 


[Captioner] 21:02:22
DUMBARTON TO LAKES PROJECT WOULD 


[Captioner] 21:02:25
BE A GREAT PROJECT TO IMPROVE 


[Captioner] 21:02:27
CONNECTIVITY THROUGH THAT AREA.


[Captioner] 21:02:29
BUT ANOTHER THING WE NEED TO 


[Captioner] 21:02:31
TALK ABOUT INSTEAD OF JUST 


[Captioner] 21:02:33
FOCUSING ON THE MAJOR PROJECT ON 


[Captioner] 21:02:35
THE MAJOR CORRIDORS IS TO ALSO 


[Captioner] 21:02:38
LOOK AT THE NEIGHBORHOOD LEVEL 


[Captioner] 21:02:38
IMPROVEMENTS.


[Captioner] 21:02:41
LIKE I MENTIONED IN MY PREVIOUS 


[Captioner] 21:02:45
COMMENT ABOUT NICOLETT 


[Captioner] 21:02:47
AFTERNOON, WE HAVE EASY PROJECTS 


[Captioner] 21:02:49
THAT WOULD SIGNIFICANTLILY 


[Captioner] 21:02:51
IMPROVE THE LIVES OF PEOPLE 


[Captioner] 21:02:52
LIVING IN THAT NEIGHBORHOOD.


[Captioner] 21:02:55
FOR EXAMPLE WHETHER IT'S 


[Captioner] 21:02:57
BUILDING BULBOUTS OR BIKE LANES 


[Captioner] 21:02:59
OR WIDENING SWRAWKS THOSE THINGS 


[Captioner] 21:03:01
NEED TO BE CONSIDERED AS WELL.


[Captioner] 21:03:05
FINALLY, FOR THE MEDIAN 


[Captioner] 21:03:07
IMPROVEMENT ON AUTO MALL, I DO 


[Captioner] 21:03:09
SUPPORT IT, I THINK IT'S A GREAT 


[Captioner] 21:03:09
THING.


[Captioner] 21:03:11
IT DOESN'T LOOK GREAT RIGHT NOW.


[Captioner] 21:03:13
HOWEVER CAN WE DO MORE WITH IT?


[Captioner] 21:03:15
LIKE IF WE'RE JUST LANDSCAPING 


[Captioner] 21:03:17
IT AND IT LOOKS NICE TO THE 


[Captioner] 21:03:19
PEOPLE DRIVING BY THAT'S GREAT 


[Captioner] 21:03:21
BUT IT'S SUCH A WIDE MEDIAN.


[Captioner] 21:03:23
CAN WE PUT SOME SORT OF LINEAR 


[Captioner] 21:03:26
PARK THERE, CAN WE MAKE IT INTO 


[Captioner] 21:03:27
A PATH THAT PEOPLE WILL BE ABLE 


[Captioner] 21:03:30
TO ENJOY, CAN WE DO MORE WITH 


[Captioner] 21:03:31
IT.


[Captioner] 21:03:33
MAYBE I'M CRAZY BUT MAYBE IT 


[Captioner] 21:03:35
WILL SERVE SOME RAIL 


[Captioner] 21:03:36
INFRASTRUCTURE THERE, WHO KNOWS.


[Captioner] 21:03:37
OKAY.


[Captioner] 21:03:38
I HAVE ONE MORE THING.


[Captioner] 21:03:40
ON THE STAFF PIECE I SUPPORT 


[Captioner] 21:03:43
THAT RIGHT, GETTING DEDICATED 


[Captioner] 21:03:45
STAFF THAT ARE FULL TIME WORKING 


[Captioner] 21:03:47
FOR THE CITY.


[Captioner] 21:03:49
IS A FANTASTIC IDEA.


[Captioner] 21:03:51
I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE DONE THAT 


[Captioner] 21:03:52
ALREADY.


[Captioner] 21:03:53
THERE IS, YOU KNOW, THERE IS NO 


[Captioner] 21:03:55
REASON WE NEED TO BE CONTRACTING 


[Captioner] 21:03:57
EVERY SINGLE THING OUT.


[Captioner] 21:03:58
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.


[Captioner] 21:03:59
>> The Clerk:   THE NEXT SPEAKER 


[Captioner] 21:04:02
IS ANNIE THEN WE'LL GO TO THE 


[Captioner] 21:04:02
ZOOM SPEAKERS.


[Captioner] 21:04:14
>> HELLO, I'M HERE TO COMMENT ON 


[Captioner] 21:04:15
THE BUDGET, SORRY NOT THE 


[Captioner] 21:04:17
BUDGET, THE CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS 


[Captioner] 21:04:19
PROJECT, TWO MAIN THINGS.


[Captioner] 21:04:21
FIRST I'D LIKE TO ECHO THE 


[Captioner] 21:04:23
COMMENTS OF THE PREVIOUS 


[Captioner] 21:04:23
SPEAKER.


[Captioner] 21:04:25
I'D REALLY LOVE TO SEE THE 


[Captioner] 21:04:28
MEDIAN OF AUTO MALL BE USED IN A 


[Captioner] 21:04:29
PRODUCTIVE CAPACITY AS OPPOSED 


[Captioner] 21:04:32
TO JUST AN ESTHETICALLY PLEASING 


[Captioner] 21:04:33
CAPACITY.


[Captioner] 21:04:37
AGAIN SOME SORT OF A LINEAR 


[Captioner] 21:04:40
SPARK OR MULTIMODAL USE OF THAT 


[Captioner] 21:04:43
SPACE THAT IS ALREADY CITY 


[Captioner] 21:04:45
PROPERTY AND COULD PROVIDE A 


[Captioner] 21:04:47
BENEFIT TO MANY OTHER CITIZENS 


[Captioner] 21:04:49
IF THERE IS KIND OF A USEFUL 


[Captioner] 21:04:50
CAPACITY AND LAND USE THERE AS 


[Captioner] 21:04:52
OPPOSED TO JUST SOME NICE 


[Captioner] 21:04:54
FLOWERS THAT PEOPLE MIGHT SEE 


[Captioner] 21:04:56
DRIVING BY BUT NOT MUCH ELSE.


[Captioner] 21:04:58
AND SECONDLY, I'M HERE TO 


[Captioner] 21:05:02
COMMENT AS BOTH AN LGBTQ AND 


[Captioner] 21:05:05
NONBINARY COMMUNITY MEMBER AND 


[Captioner] 21:05:07
SAY THAT I REALLY APPRECIATE OUR 


[Captioner] 21:05:07
COMMUNITY.


[Captioner] 21:05:09
MANY OF THE FACILITIES, MANY OF 


[Captioner] 21:05:11
THE AMENITIES THAT WE HAVE BUT 


[Captioner] 21:05:12
AT THE SAME TIME, I CAN'T HELP 


[Captioner] 21:05:15
BUT NOTICE THAT THERE IS A 


[Captioner] 21:05:17
LARGE, LARGE LACK OF GENDER 


[Captioner] 21:05:20
NEUTRAL PUBLIC SPACES, THERE ARE 


[Captioner] 21:05:22
GENDER NEUTRAL PUBLIC REST ROOMS 


[Captioner] 21:05:24
IN MANY OF OUR HIGH TRAFFIC 


[Captioner] 21:05:26
PUBLIC SPACES SUCH AS OUR 


[Captioner] 21:05:28
DOWNTOWN EVENTS CENTER AND 


[Captioner] 21:05:29
UNDERSTAND THAT THERE CURRENTLY 


[Captioner] 21:05:31
IS NO LEGAL REQUIREMENT TO PUT 


[Captioner] 21:05:33
THOSE IN UNTIL RENOVATIONS MAY 


[Captioner] 21:05:33
OCCUR.


[Captioner] 21:05:37
BUT FOR PURPOSES OF INCLUSIVITY, 


[Captioner] 21:05:38
I WOULD URGE OUR COUNCIL TO 


[Captioner] 21:05:40
DIRECT STAFF TO FIGURE OUT SOME 


[Captioner] 21:05:41
CREATIVE WAYS TO INCREASE THE 


[Captioner] 21:05:44
NUMBER OF GENDER NEUTRAL 


[Captioner] 21:05:46
RESTROOMS IN OUR PREEXISTING 


[Captioner] 21:05:48
PUBLIC SPACES TO ENSURE THAT 


[Captioner] 21:05:50
THOSE SPACES ARE EVEN MORE 


[Captioner] 21:05:51
INCLUSIVE AND MORE WELCOMING TO 


[Captioner] 21:05:53
THE GREATEST NUMBER OF COMMUNITY 


[Captioner] 21:05:53
MEMBERS POSSIBLE.


[Captioner] 21:05:55
I SEE THAT SOME FUNDS ARE 


[Captioner] 21:05:57
PLANNED TO BE USED FOR 


[Captioner] 21:05:59
BATHROOMS, SPECIFICALLY 


[Captioner] 21:06:02
RESTROOMS AT PARKS AND WOULD 


[Captioner] 21:06:03
LOVE TO SEE GENDER NEUTRAL 


[Captioner] 21:06:05
FACILITIES THERE AND GENDER 


[Captioner] 21:06:06
NEUTRAL FACILITIES IN THE NEW 


[Captioner] 21:06:07
CENTRAL PARK COMMUNITY CENTER 


[Captioner] 21:06:10
WHEN THAT GETS BUILT.


[Captioner] 21:06:11
I THINK THAT IT'S VERY IMPORTANT 


[Captioner] 21:06:13
TO SEE MANY OF THESE RESTROOMS 


[Captioner] 21:06:15
EITHER RELABELED OR 


[Captioner] 21:06:17
RETRO70thED AS GENDER KNEW 


[Captioner] 21:06:19
TRAL IN SOME OF OUR HIGH TRAFFIC 


[Captioner] 21:06:20
AND HIGH CAPACITY PUBLIC AREAS 


[Captioner] 21:06:23
TO ENSURE THAT NONBINARY 


[Captioner] 21:06:24
COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND COMMUNITY 


[Captioner] 21:06:26
MEMBERS THAT MAY NOT EITHER BE 


[Captioner] 21:06:28
MALE OR FEMALE CAN EFFECTIVELY 


[Captioner] 21:06:30
AND SAFELY USE THE RESTROOM 


[Captioner] 21:06:32
WITHOUT FEELING UNCOMFORTABLE.


[Captioner] 21:06:35
SO PLEASE DIRECT STAFF TO 


[Captioner] 21:06:37
EXPLORE CREATIVE WAYS TO 


[Captioner] 21:06:38
INCREASE THE NUMBER OF THESE 


[Captioner] 21:06:41
GENDER NOOULT RESTROOMS AND ALSO 


[Captioner] 21:06:42
DIRECT STAFF TO EXPLORE WAYS TO 


[Captioner] 21:06:45
USE THE MEDIAN WITHIN AUTO MALL 


[Captioner] 21:06:47
PARKWAY IN A PRODUCTIVE 


[Captioner] 21:06:47
CAPACITY.


[Captioner] 21:06:47
THANK YOU SO MUCH.


[Captioner] 21:06:49
>> The Clerk:   THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 21:06:56
WE'RE GOING TO ZOOM YONGGANG 


[Captioner] 21:06:57
DENG.


[Captioner] 21:07:02
>> HELLO MY NAME IS YONGGANG 


[Captioner] 21:07:04
ZHANG SPEAKING FOR MYSELF.


[Captioner] 21:07:06
FIRST OF ALL I WOULD LIKE TO 


[Captioner] 21:07:08
THANK DIRECTOR WOLF AND DIRECTOR 


[Captioner] 21:07:11
LARSEN FOR THE PRESENTATION, 


[Captioner] 21:07:18
ALWAYS HAVE GOOD IDEAS FOR 


[Captioner] 21:07:19
IMPROVING OUR PARKS.


[Captioner] 21:07:23
THE INFLUENCE PARKS THAT CAN, 


[Captioner] 21:07:25
CREATE NEW VACANT LAND TO 


[Captioner] 21:07:26
PERHAPS HARD TRAFFIC AREA.


[Captioner] 21:07:28
I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT THE 


[Captioner] 21:07:31
ADEQUATE PARKING SPACE HAS TO BE 


[Captioner] 21:07:32
BUILT.


[Captioner] 21:07:37
THE DOG PARK AND PATTERSON RANCH 


[Captioner] 21:07:40
FROM THE BLUE POINT IT SEEMS 


[Captioner] 21:07:41
LIKE THERE IS ONLY TEN PARKING 


[Captioner] 21:07:42
SPACES.


[Captioner] 21:07:44
AND IT IS BUILT NEXT TO THE 


[Captioner] 21:07:46
ARDENWOOD STREET WHICH IS HIGH 


[Captioner] 21:07:48
SPEED AND NO STREET PARKING 


[Captioner] 21:07:49
ALLOWED.


[Captioner] 21:07:52
IF I RECALL CORRECTLY.


[Captioner] 21:07:54
SO TEN PARKING SPACES IS 


[Captioner] 21:07:55
DEFINITELY NOT ENOUGH FOR A DOG 


[Captioner] 21:07:57
PARK.


[Captioner] 21:08:01
SO THAT AREA IS ACTUALLY QUITE 


[Captioner] 21:08:02
LARGE.


[Captioner] 21:08:05
SO I REALLY HOPE THAT THE PARK 


[Captioner] 21:08:06
WOULD BE -- THE LAND WOULD BE 


[Captioner] 21:08:08
BETTER UTILIZED.


[Captioner] 21:08:11
I WOULD LIKE TO ALSO PERSISTENT 


[Captioner] 21:08:14
OUT SOME -- LIKE TO ADDRESS ANY 


[Captioner] 21:08:16
MORE OUTREACHES IN THE AREA 


[Captioner] 21:08:20
WHERE ANY AREA THAT WHEN THE NEW 


[Captioner] 21:08:21
PARK WE'RE GOING TO BUILD.


[Captioner] 21:08:23
SO EVEN BEFORE THE DESIGN STAGE 


[Captioner] 21:08:25
TO GET SOME IDEAS.


[Captioner] 21:08:26
BUT OVERALL I THINK THAT'S A 


[Captioner] 21:08:29
GOOD ADDITION TO A COMMUNITY AND 


[Captioner] 21:08:32
EVERYTHING SEEMS AMENABLE.


[Captioner] 21:08:34
ACTUALLY ANOTHER COMMENT ABOUT 


[Captioner] 21:08:37
ANOTHER DOG PARK PROPOSED IN 


[Captioner] 21:08:38
VALLEJO MILL.


[Captioner] 21:08:40
IT'S KIND OF A WEIRD LOCATION 


[Captioner] 21:08:41
BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE A DOG PARK 


[Captioner] 21:08:43
IN THE SOUTH PART.


[Captioner] 21:08:46
WE HAVE ONE IN THE CENTRAL PARK, 


[Captioner] 21:08:52
ONE PROPOSED IN THE NORTH, WHY 


[Captioner] 21:08:53
NOT DOG PARK IN THE SOUTH?


[Captioner] 21:08:55
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 21:08:56
>> The Clerk:   THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 21:09:03
THE NEXT SPEAKER IS JIN MEI 


[Captioner] 21:09:05
ZHANG.


[Captioner] 21:09:07
>> OKAY CAN YOU HEAR ME?


[Captioner] 21:09:07
>> The Clerk:   YES.


[Captioner] 21:09:09
>> I HAVE ONE QUESTION AND ONE 


[Captioner] 21:09:10
COMMENT.


[Captioner] 21:09:12
THE FIRST QUESTION IS, I'M 


[Captioner] 21:09:16
THOUGHT SURE ABOUT THE FREEWAY, 


[Captioner] 21:09:17
880 FREEWAY.


[Captioner] 21:09:19
IS TREATMENT CITY'S 


[Captioner] 21:09:19
RESPONSIBILITY?


[Captioner] 21:09:21
BECAUSE THE 880 FREEWAY HAS SO 


[Captioner] 21:09:26
MANY POTHOLES.


[Captioner] 21:09:27
AND THE CONDITION IS SO BAD.


[Captioner] 21:09:30
AND IS IT SOMETHING CITY?


[Captioner] 21:09:32
BECAUSE I SAW THAT THERE IS SOME 


[Captioner] 21:09:35
KIND OF PAVEMENT MAINTENANCE 


[Captioner] 21:09:37
PLAN FOR THE STREET, CITY 


[Captioner] 21:09:37
STREET.


[Captioner] 21:09:40
BUT IT'S FREEWAY, 880 IS 


[Captioner] 21:09:42
FREMONT, YOU KNOW FREMONT 


[Captioner] 21:09:44
PORTION IS AT FREMONT CITY'S 


[Captioner] 21:09:45
RESPONSIBILITY?


[Captioner] 21:09:46
OKAY.


[Captioner] 21:09:47
THAT'S MY QUESTION.


[Captioner] 21:09:49
AND MY COMMENT IS REGARDING THE 


[Captioner] 21:09:50
DOG PARK.


[Captioner] 21:09:54
THE DOG PARK THAT IS PLANNED TO 


[Captioner] 21:09:56
BUILD NEAR THE ARDENWOOD AND 


[Captioner] 21:09:58
PASEO PADRE PARKWAY, I HEARD 


[Captioner] 21:10:00
SOME CONCERN FROM A NEIGHBOR 


[Captioner] 21:10:04
THAT PEOPLE FEAR THAT MAYBE THE 


[Captioner] 21:10:06
PARK IS TOO CLOSE TO THE 


[Captioner] 21:10:08
INTERSECTION.


[Captioner] 21:10:10
PEOPLE SPHERE THAT DOGS MAY RUN 


[Captioner] 21:10:14
OUT AND GET HURT BY THE PASSING 


[Captioner] 21:10:16
CAR.


[Captioner] 21:10:21
SO THAT'S MY COMMENT.


[Captioner] 21:10:23
MAYBE WE SHOULD BUILD THE DOG 


[Captioner] 21:10:24
PARK A LITTLE BIT FURTHER AWAY 


[Captioner] 21:10:27
THERE THE INTERSECTION, AND IN 


[Captioner] 21:10:33
THE -- IN CLOSER TO THE I MEAN 


[Captioner] 21:10:34
THE OTHER PART.


[Captioner] 21:10:36
YEAH.


[Captioner] 21:10:37
AND THEN AT A.


[Captioner] 21:10:37
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 21:10:39
>> The Clerk:   THE NEXT SPIEKER 


[Captioner] 21:10:40
IS KELLY.


[Captioner] 21:10:48
>> THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 21:10:51
WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT SOME OF 


[Captioner] 21:10:53
THESE PROJECTS, FOR EXAMPLE, THE 


[Captioner] 21:10:54
MAINTENANCE PROJECT, WE JUST 


[Captioner] 21:10:56
HEARD ABOUT ALL THIS HUGE 


[Captioner] 21:11:01
INCREASE IN FUNDING GOING INTO 


[Captioner] 21:11:03
STREET REPAVING.


[Captioner] 21:11:07
WE NEED TO I THINK ALSO HAVE 


[Captioner] 21:11:11
FIRMLY IN MIND AN IDEA OF A 


[Captioner] 21:11:13
METRIC FOR WHAT IS REPAVING, 


[Captioner] 21:11:15
WHAT IS THE STREET CONDITION IN 


[Captioner] 21:11:15
FREMONT?


[Captioner] 21:11:18
AND THOSE METRICS THEY HAVE 


[Captioner] 21:11:22
ALREADY INVENTED IT, AND THEY'RE 


[Captioner] 21:11:24
CALLED THE PAVEMENT CONDITION 


[Captioner] 21:11:24
INDEX.


[Captioner] 21:11:26
SO IF YOU'RE PUTTING IN LESS 


[Captioner] 21:11:27
MONEY PER YEAR THEN YOU WOULD 


[Captioner] 21:11:29
EXPECT TO GET A LOWER NUMBER IN 


[Captioner] 21:11:31
THE PAVEMENT CONDITION INDEX AND 


[Captioner] 21:11:33
IF YOU'RE PUTTING IN MORE MONEY 


[Captioner] 21:11:35
PER YEAR, WHAT KIND OF 


[Captioner] 21:11:36
IMPROVEMENT SHOULD WE BE 


[Captioner] 21:11:39
EXPECTING IN THE PAVEMENT 


[Captioner] 21:11:40
CONDITION INDEX?


[Captioner] 21:11:41
LIKEWISE WITH THE TREES, JUST 


[Captioner] 21:11:44
BECAUSE ALL THE TREES FELL DOWN 


[Captioner] 21:11:47
OR COLLAPSED AND GOT BLOWN OVER 


[Captioner] 21:11:48
OR WHATEVER AND ALL THE 


[Captioner] 21:11:50
EMPLOYEES WENT OUT TO TAKE CARE 


[Captioner] 21:11:53
OF THE PROBLEM, THE PAVEMENT, 


[Captioner] 21:11:55
PAVEMENT AND TREES BOTH GO 


[Captioner] 21:11:58
OVER -- THERE'S A TIPPING POINT.


[Captioner] 21:12:01
IF YOU REPAVE, KEEP THE REPAVED 


[Captioner] 21:12:02
CONSTANTLY AND CONSTANTLY 


[Captioner] 21:12:04
MAINTAIN THE STREETS YOU SPEND 


[Captioner] 21:12:04
LESS MONEY.


[Captioner] 21:12:06
IF YOU WAIT UNTIL THE POTHOLES 


[Captioner] 21:12:08
GET BIG THEN YOU HAVE TO 


[Captioner] 21:12:10
REBUILD, REPAVE, REBUILD YOUR 


[Captioner] 21:12:12
STREETS YOU SPEND MORE MONEY.


[Captioner] 21:12:14
SAME WITH THE TREES.


[Captioner] 21:12:15
IF YOU ARE OUT THERE MAINTAINING 


[Captioner] 21:12:17
THE TREES CONSTANTLY THEN YOU 


[Captioner] 21:12:19
SPEND LESS MONEY BUT IF YOU WAIT 


[Captioner] 21:12:21
UNTIL THEY ALL FALL OVER THEN 


[Captioner] 21:12:22
YOU LOSE -- YOU DON'T HAVE ANY 


[Captioner] 21:12:24
TREES LEFT AND YOU ALSO PROBABLY 


[Captioner] 21:12:26
SPEND MORE MONEY IN THE END WITH 


[Captioner] 21:12:27
ALL THE PEOPLE THAT YOU HAVE TO 


[Captioner] 21:12:30
SEND OUT TO FIX THE TREES.


[Captioner] 21:12:32
AND EARLIER WE HEARD ABOUT 


[Captioner] 21:12:34
RESTROOMS, A TOP PRIORITY.


[Captioner] 21:12:37
WELL, THIS CITY, WHEN LAST WEEK 


[Captioner] 21:12:39
WHEN THE CITY WAS SO FOCUSED ON 


[Captioner] 21:12:42
MISSION PEAK SOMEHOW IT FORGOT 


[Captioner] 21:12:43
THAT MISSION PEAK IS ONE OF THE 


[Captioner] 21:12:45
MOST POPULAR AREAS IN FREMONT.


[Captioner] 21:12:49
AND MISSION PEAK HAS NO 


[Captioner] 21:12:49
RESTROOMS.


[Captioner] 21:12:54
IT HAS, YOU KNOW, BALL TOILETS 


[Captioner] 21:12:58
AND PORT A POTIES, ONE SPEAKER 


[Captioner] 21:13:01
LAST WEEK MADE A VIDEO ABOUT THE 


[Captioner] 21:13:03
TOILET LINE AT APPLICATION PEAK 


[Captioner] 21:13:05
WHICH WAS A TAMOUS VIDEO TO TRY 


[Captioner] 21:13:08
TO MAKE THE POINT THAT THE PARK 


[Captioner] 21:13:11
IS OVERCROWDED OR IN MY VIEW HE 


[Captioner] 21:13:14
MADE THE POINT THAT THE PARK HAS 


[Captioner] 21:13:15
INSUFFICIENT INVESTMENT IN 


[Captioner] 21:13:15
FACILITIES.


[Captioner] 21:13:19
AND IF THE CITY IS GOING TO PUMP 


[Captioner] 21:13:21
MONEY INTO RESTROOMS WHY DON'T 


[Captioner] 21:13:24
YOU PUT MONEY INTO WHERE THE 


[Captioner] 21:13:25
PEOPLE ARE AT MISSION PEAK, 


[Captioner] 21:13:26
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 21:13:27
>> The Clerk:   THE NEXT SPEAKER 


[Captioner] 21:13:29
IS JOHN HINES.


[Captioner] 21:13:31
>> HELLO EVERYONE.


[Captioner] 21:13:35
ON THE WHOLE, THE CIP PLAN LOOKS 


[Captioner] 21:13:36
GOOD TO ME.


[Captioner] 21:13:38
THERE IS JUST ONE ITEM I WANT TO 


[Captioner] 21:13:40
TOUCH ON, AND THAT IS THE 


[Captioner] 21:13:42
CURRENTLY PROPOSAL OR THE 


[Captioner] 21:13:43
SABERCAT PARK.


[Captioner] 21:13:46
SABERCAT IS VERY UNUSUAL AMONG 


[Captioner] 21:13:47
FREMONT'S PARKS.


[Captioner] 21:13:49
IN THAT THE SHAPE OF THE LAND 


[Captioner] 21:13:51
AND THE RUDDINGNESS OF IT MEANS 


[Captioner] 21:13:53
IT'S NOT REALLY SUITABLE FOR 


[Captioner] 21:13:55
MOST NORMAL PARK USES.


[Captioner] 21:13:56
YOU CAN'T PUT A BASEBALL FIELD 


[Captioner] 21:13:59
HAD OR HOLD A VERY BIG PICNIC OR 


[Captioner] 21:14:01
BUILD A COMMUNITY CENTER.


[Captioner] 21:14:03
IT'S PRETTY MUCH USEFUL ONLY AS 


[Captioner] 21:14:06
A SCENIC FOOT PATH WHICH IS WHAT 


[Captioner] 21:14:07
IT IS NOW.


[Captioner] 21:14:09
THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT AS A 


[Captioner] 21:14:11
SCENIC FOOT PATH THAT PARK 


[Captioner] 21:14:11
REALLY SHINES.


[Captioner] 21:14:14
IT IS A VERY NICE SCENIC FOOT 


[Captioner] 21:14:15
PATH.


[Captioner] 21:14:17
YOU CAN REACH IT QUICKLY.


[Captioner] 21:14:18
IT'S ACCESSIBLE TO A GREAT MANY 


[Captioner] 21:14:19
PEOPLE.


[Captioner] 21:14:20
IT'S NOT TOO LONG.


[Captioner] 21:14:22
BUT IT'S ENOUGH TO GET AWAY FROM 


[Captioner] 21:14:24
CAR NOISE AND HEAR WATER RUNNING 


[Captioner] 21:14:30
DOWN THE HILL AND SO ON.


[Captioner] 21:14:33
THE PLAN THOUGH TO TURN IT INTO 


[Captioner] 21:14:34
WHAT IS ESSENTIALLY A ROADWAY 


[Captioner] 21:14:36
FOR BIKES, IF THE BIKES ARE 


[Captioner] 21:14:38
TRAVELING AT SPEED IT IS NO 


[Captioner] 21:14:39
LONGER SAFE FOR PEDESTRIANS AND 


[Captioner] 21:14:41
IF YOU PUT IN ENOUGH CONCRETE TO 


[Captioner] 21:14:43
WIDEN THE ROAD TO THE POINT 


[Captioner] 21:14:45
WHERE YOU HAVE SEPARATE LANES 


[Captioner] 21:14:47
FOR CYCLISTS AND PEDESTRIANS 


[Captioner] 21:14:49
WELL NOW IT'S NO LONGER SCENIC.


[Captioner] 21:14:51
THE ONLY WAY I THINK YOU COULD 


[Captioner] 21:14:54
SAVE ITS VALUE AS A SCENIC FOOT 


[Captioner] 21:14:56
PATH AND HAVE CYCLISTS THERE IS 


[Captioner] 21:14:58
IF THERE WERE SIGNS THROUGHOUT 


[Captioner] 21:15:02
THE PARK TO REQUIRE CYCLISTS TO 


[Captioner] 21:15:04
DISMOUNT AND WALK THEIR BIKES 


[Captioner] 21:15:05
WHILE IN THE PARK.


[Captioner] 21:15:07
BUT OTHER THAN THAT I JUST DON'T 


[Captioner] 21:15:09
SEE HOW THIS IS ANYTHING BUT A 


[Captioner] 21:15:10
REPURPOSING OF A NICE 20 MINUTE 


[Captioner] 21:15:12
WALK FOR PEDESTRIANS INTO A 


[Captioner] 21:15:15
THREE OR FOUR MINUTE ALLEY FOR 


[Captioner] 21:15:17
CYCLISTS.


[Captioner] 21:15:20
IT IS A LOSS ON ONE SIDE AT 


[Captioner] 21:15:22
LEAST AS BIG AS THE GAIN ON THE 


[Captioner] 21:15:23
OTHER.


[Captioner] 21:15:23
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 21:15:25
>> The Clerk:   THE LAST SPEAKER 


[Captioner] 21:15:25
IS SUSAN.


[Captioner] 21:15:30
>> HELLO.


[Captioner] 21:15:31
YES.


[Captioner] 21:15:33
SO I HAVE A TWO COMMENTS.


[Captioner] 21:15:37
ONE IS REGARDING THE TRAFFIC.


[Captioner] 21:15:40
AND I DON'T KNOW YOU GUYS NOTICE 


[Captioner] 21:15:43
ON THE ONE WHEN YOU TURN INTO 


[Captioner] 21:15:45
CIVIC CENTER ON THE RIGHT TURN 


[Captioner] 21:15:47
TO KAISER, AND BECAUSE WE 


[Captioner] 21:15:50
IMPLEMENT A NEW BLOCK, AND WHEN 


[Captioner] 21:15:52
YOU TURN YOU HAVE TO REALLY MAKE 


[Captioner] 21:15:54
A TURN.


[Captioner] 21:15:55
AND IF YOU ARE NOT CAREFUL YOU 


[Captioner] 21:15:57
CAN REALLY TIP OVER.


[Captioner] 21:16:00
SO I WISH OUR FREMONT TRAFFIC 


[Captioner] 21:16:02
DEPARTMENT CAN RETHINK ABOUT HOW 


[Captioner] 21:16:05
CAN WE IMPROVE THOSE AREA.


[Captioner] 21:16:07
AND BECAUSE THAT IS VERY CLOSE 


[Captioner] 21:16:08
TO THE HOSPITAL.


[Captioner] 21:16:12
AND SO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE IT'S 


[Captioner] 21:16:14
EASY FOR PEOPLE TO GET INTO THE 


[Captioner] 21:16:16
HOSPITAL ESPECIALLY DURING THE 


[Captioner] 21:16:18
NIGHT, FOLLOWING EMERGENCY CARE 


[Captioner] 21:16:20
SO THAT'S MY FIRST COMMENT.


[Captioner] 21:16:22
MY SECOND COMMENT IS REGARDING 


[Captioner] 21:16:23
PATTERSON RANCH DOG PARK 


[Captioner] 21:16:24
PROPOSAL.


[Captioner] 21:16:26
AND I BELIEVE SEVERAL PEOPLE 


[Captioner] 21:16:29
ALREADY TALK ABOUT IT.


[Captioner] 21:16:32
THAT AREA IS VERY -- HAS A VERY 


[Captioner] 21:16:34
HIGH TRAFFIC AND IT'S VERY 


[Captioner] 21:16:36
DANGEROUS AND IT HAS NO PARKING 


[Captioner] 21:16:38
AROUND THAT AREA.


[Captioner] 21:16:41
INSTEAD OF BUILDING A NEW ONE 


[Captioner] 21:16:47
WHY DON'T WE UTILIZE COYOTE PARK 


[Captioner] 21:16:49
INTO ADDITIONAL OR EXPANDED DOG 


[Captioner] 21:16:52
PLACE AND LIKE A MYSTERY TRIAL 


[Captioner] 21:16:56
OR FREE LET A DOG KIND OF 


[Captioner] 21:16:58
RUNNING AROUND IN THAT AREA 


[Captioner] 21:16:59
BECAUSE THAT IS OPEN AREA.


[Captioner] 21:17:01
SO WE CAN USE -- WE DON'T HAVE 


[Captioner] 21:17:02
TO SPEND ADDITIONAL MONEY FOR 


[Captioner] 21:17:04
THAT AND WE CAN USE THAT MONEY 


[Captioner] 21:17:06
FOR SOMETHING ELSE TO IMPROVE 


[Captioner] 21:17:07
THE FREMONT PARK.


[Captioner] 21:17:08
SO THAT'S IT.


[Captioner] 21:17:09
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 21:17:12
OH AGAIN THANK YOU FOR EVERYBODY 


[Captioner] 21:17:13
SPENDING TIME HERE, YEAH.


[Captioner] 21:17:17
>> The Clerk:   THAT WAS THE 


[Captioner] 21:17:19
LAST SPEAKER.


[Captioner] 21:17:19
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 21:17:21
AND I'LL TURN IT BACK TO THE 


[Captioner] 21:17:22
COUNCIL FOR CLARIFYING COMMENTS 


[Captioner] 21:17:24
BUT I WILL MAKE SOME QUICK 


[Captioner] 21:17:25
COMMENTS TOO JUST TO LET PEOPLE 


[Captioner] 21:17:26
KNOW.


[Captioner] 21:17:27
I KNOW THAT THE CAPITAL 


[Captioner] 21:17:28
IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM AND I REALLY 


[Captioner] 21:17:30
WANT TO THANK THE STAFF FOR 


[Captioner] 21:17:31
THEIR PRESENTATION BUT FOR BOTH 


[Captioner] 21:17:34
THAT AS WELL AS THE PROPOSED 


[Captioner] 21:17:36
BUDGET THIS EVENING, JUST TO LET 


[Captioner] 21:17:37
YOU KNOW IT'S A SIGNIFICANTLY 


[Captioner] 21:17:40
SIZED BINDER AND THERE IS A LOT 


[Captioner] 21:17:41
OF DETAIL IN THAT SO IF YOU WANT 


[Captioner] 21:17:43
TO LOOK AT OUR CITY WEBSITE IT 


[Captioner] 21:17:45
DOES GO INTO THE DETAIL THE 


[Captioner] 21:17:48
BREAKDOWN OF I'VE OF THE FUNDING 


[Captioner] 21:17:50
SOURCES, THE YEAR ON YEAR 


[Captioner] 21:17:53
BREAKDOWN FOR YEAR 1 TO YEAR 5 


[Captioner] 21:17:55
AND WE UPDATE IT FOR EVERY TWO 


[Captioner] 21:17:56
YEARS.


[Captioner] 21:17:58
IT ALLOWS US A ROAD MAP 


[Captioner] 21:18:00
INCLUDING SOME OF THE AREAS THAT 


[Captioner] 21:18:01
WE WANT TO ADDRESS.


[Captioner] 21:18:03
ONE OF THE CONFUSION 


[Captioner] 21:18:04
UNFORTUNATELY WHETHER IT'S 


[Captioner] 21:18:06
ROADWAYS OR PARKS SOME OF THESE 


[Captioner] 21:18:08
ROADWAYS ARE UNDER THE CITY'S 


[Captioner] 21:18:10
JURISDICTION BUT TO CLARIFY I 


[Captioner] 21:18:10
KNOW WE GET A LOT OF QUESTIONS 


[Captioner] 21:18:11
ON THIS.


[Captioner] 21:18:14
THE HIGHWAYS FALL INTO DIFFERENT 


[Captioner] 21:18:14
JURISDICTION.


[Captioner] 21:18:17
IN A PARTICULAR 880 FALLS INTO 


[Captioner] 21:18:20
CALTRANS SO THAT'S A SEPARATE 


[Captioner] 21:18:24
AGENCY THAT MAINTAINS THE 


[Captioner] 21:18:26
PAVEMENT REPAIRS AND POTHOLES.


[Captioner] 21:18:27
RELATED TO THE COMMENTS THAT 


[Captioner] 21:18:29
SOME PEOPLE HAVE MADE MENTION 


[Captioner] 21:18:31
TO, WE ARE FORTUNATE IN OUR CITY 


[Captioner] 21:18:33
TO HAVE AN INCREDIBLE PARK 


[Captioner] 21:18:34
NETWORK BUT WE ARE EXTREMELY 


[Captioner] 21:18:37
BLESSED TO HAVE SOME EAST BAY 


[Captioner] 21:18:39
REGIONAL PARKS, ACTUALLY IT'S 


[Captioner] 21:18:41
SEVEN IF I'M CORRECT THAT ARE IN 


[Captioner] 21:18:41
OUR CITY.


[Captioner] 21:18:43
SO THOSE WE DO NOT HAVE 


[Captioner] 21:18:44
JURISDICTION OVER.


[Captioner] 21:18:46
AND THEN AS FOR ALSO QUESTIONS 


[Captioner] 21:18:48
FOR THE DOG PARK BECAUSE I HEARD 


[Captioner] 21:18:49
SOME GENERAL QUESTIONS, I 


[Captioner] 21:18:51
ENCOURAGE PEOPLE, I KNOW WE ARE 


[Captioner] 21:18:54
IN THE PROCESS OF UPDATING AND 


[Captioner] 21:18:57
UPGRADING THE TURF HIRE.


[Captioner] 21:18:58
BUT IN TERMS OF LOCATIONS MUCH 


[Captioner] 21:19:00
LIKE THE ONES IN UNION CITY AND 


[Captioner] 21:19:03
MILPITAS AND OTHER AREAS, IT IS 


[Captioner] 21:19:05
USUALLY CLOSED GATES, A SERIES 


[Captioner] 21:19:08
OF GATES THAT WAY THE DOGS DON'T 


[Captioner] 21:19:10
GET LOOSE AND IDEALLY THEY ARE 


[Captioner] 21:19:11
WALKING TO THE DOG PARK.


[Captioner] 21:19:13
COMMUNITY DIRECTOR SUZANNE DID 


[Captioner] 21:19:15
YOU WANT TO MAKE SOME COMMENTS 


[Captioner] 21:19:18
ON THAT?


[Captioner] 21:19:18
>> Suzanne Shenfil:   I 


[Captioner] 21:19:20
APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS FROM THE 


[Captioner] 21:19:21
PUBLIC THIS EVENING.


[Captioner] 21:19:23
JUST BECAUSE IT'S AN OPEN SPACE 


[Captioner] 21:19:25
AREA IT'S HARD TO IMAGINE WHAT A 


[Captioner] 21:19:26
DOG PARK MIGHT LOOK LIKE.


[Captioner] 21:19:28
SO WITH COUNCILMEMBER KENG WE 


[Captioner] 21:19:30
WENT OUT AND TOOK A LOOK AND A 


[Captioner] 21:19:31
PREVIEW OF THE SITE WITH THE 


[Captioner] 21:19:32
COMMUNITY.


[Captioner] 21:19:34
IT IS CERTAINLY POSSIBLE THAT WE 


[Captioner] 21:19:36
WOULD EXPLORE APPROPRIATE 


[Captioner] 21:19:38
PARKING FOR PATTERSON RANCH AND 


[Captioner] 21:19:40
LOOK AT THAT IF WE NEED 


[Captioner] 21:19:41
ADDITIONAL PARKING.


[Captioner] 21:19:42
IT IS ALSO VERY MUCH A TRUE 


[Captioner] 21:19:45
STATEMENT THAT WE WILL HAVE A 


[Captioner] 21:19:46
FENCED FACILITY FOR THE DOGS.


[Captioner] 21:19:49
WE HAVE A CONCEPT PLAN RIGHT NOW 


[Captioner] 21:19:51
BUT ONCE THIS IS APPROVED BY THE 


[Captioner] 21:19:52
CITY COUNCIL THROUGH THIS 


[Captioner] 21:19:55
PROCESS THEN WE WOULD GO FORWARD 


[Captioner] 21:19:57
AND BEGIN THE DESIGN PROJECT AND 


[Captioner] 21:19:59
WE WOULD BRING IT BACK TO THE 


[Captioner] 21:20:00
COMMUNITY FOR AN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT 


[Captioner] 21:20:02
THAT WE'RE IN THE RIGHT DRECT 


[Captioner] 21:20:03
DIRECTION FOR THE PLAN AND 


[Captioner] 21:20:04
MOVING FORWARD WITH THE 


[Captioner] 21:20:06
COMMUNITY TO PURSUE THE DOG PARK 


[Captioner] 21:20:08
WHICH WE KNOW IS MUCH NEEDED 


[Captioner] 21:20:09
THROUGHOUT ENTIRE COMMUNITY.


[Captioner] 21:20:10
ALSO IN THE SOUTH AREA WE'RE 


[Captioner] 21:20:12
LOOKING AT PACIFIC COMMONS AS 


[Captioner] 21:20:13
WELL AS THE DOG PARK OPPORTUNITY 


[Captioner] 21:20:15
AS WELL ALSO, TO ANSWER THAT 


[Captioner] 21:20:17
QUESTION.


[Captioner] 21:20:18
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 21:20:19
SO AT THIS TIME I'LL TURN IT 


[Captioner] 21:20:21
BACK TO THE COUNCIL FOR 


[Captioner] 21:20:22
CLARIFYING COMMENTS AND AGAIN 


[Captioner] 21:20:24
THIS IS A MULTISTEP PROCESS THAT 


[Captioner] 21:20:25
WE'LL BE GOING THROUGH.


[Captioner] 21:20:27
SO I'LL LET YOU ASK SOME OF YOUR 


[Captioner] 21:20:30
QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS AND I HAVE 


[Captioner] 21:20:30
SOME TO ADD AT THE END.


[Captioner] 21:20:32
BUT ARE THERE ANY OTHER ONES 


[Captioner] 21:20:34
THAT ANYONE WANTS TO ADD?


[Captioner] 21:20:37
COUNCILMEMBER KENG.


[Captioner] 21:20:38
>> Councilmember Keng:   THANK 


[Captioner] 21:20:38
YOU MADAM MAYOR.


[Captioner] 21:20:40
SO I WANT TO APPRECIATE THE TEAM 


[Captioner] 21:20:42
AGAIN FOR THIS VERY EXTENSIVE 


[Captioner] 21:20:43
PLAN.


[Captioner] 21:20:45
AND IT IS CERTAINLY A VERY 


[Captioner] 21:20:47
EXCITING TIME COMING UP IN THE 


[Captioner] 21:20:49
NEXT FEW YEARS AS WE FINALLY 


[Captioner] 21:20:51
HAVE THE BUDGET TO WORK WITH TO 


[Captioner] 21:20:54
IMPLEMENT A LOT OF THESE OVERDUE 


[Captioner] 21:20:55
PROJECTS THAT WE'VE BEEN HOPING 


[Captioner] 21:21:02
TO WORK ON INCLUDING THE CENTER, 


[Captioner] 21:21:04
THE COMMUNITY CENTER AT LAKE 


[Captioner] 21:21:06
ELIZABETH, A LOT OF THE MAJOR 


[Captioner] 21:21:07
REPAIRS THAT THE CITY BUILDING 


[Captioner] 21:21:10
NEEDS, THE ROOF AND THE HVAC 


[Captioner] 21:21:13
SYSTEM UPDATE, ADA ACCESS, AS 


[Captioner] 21:21:15
WELL AS THE CITYWIDE PARK 


[Captioner] 21:21:16
RESTROOMS.


[Captioner] 21:21:18
WHICH WE HAVE BEEN ADVOCATING 


[Captioner] 21:21:20
ASKING FOR IN THE LAST FEW 


[Captioner] 21:21:22
YEARS, LAST 74 OR FIVE YEARS.


[Captioner] 21:21:25
SOME OF MY NEWER COLLEAGUES, 


[Captioner] 21:21:27
WEREN'T HERE, BUT YOU KNOW AS A 


[Captioner] 21:21:32
PARENT OF YOUNG KIDS, THE PARKS 


[Captioner] 21:21:33
ARE SOME OF THE PLACES THAT, YOU 


[Captioner] 21:21:35
KNOW, WE USE THE MOST IN THE 


[Captioner] 21:21:36
CITY.


[Captioner] 21:21:38
AND WE'RE THERE LIKE EVERY 


[Captioner] 21:21:40
WEEKEND OR SOMETIMES LIKE 


[Captioner] 21:21:41
MULTIPLE TIMES IN THE WEEK.


[Captioner] 21:21:44
AND THE RESTROOMS ARE SOMETHING 


[Captioner] 21:21:46
THAT YOU KNOW ARE ESSENTIAL FOR 


[Captioner] 21:21:47
THESE VISITS.


[Captioner] 21:21:50
SO AND WE HEARD EARLIER THE 


[Captioner] 21:21:53
COMMENTS TO BUILD KIND OF MORE 


[Captioner] 21:21:55
ACCESSIBLE BATHROOMS, RESTROOMS 


[Captioner] 21:21:55
FOR EVERYONE.


[Captioner] 21:21:59
SO I'M SURE, YOU KNOW, SO 


[Captioner] 21:22:00
SUZANNE HAS BEEN NODDING HER 


[Captioner] 21:22:03
HEAD AND WE'LL TRY TO WORK IN AS 


[Captioner] 21:22:05
MUCH AS THAT AS WE CAN.


[Captioner] 21:22:06
AND I KNOW THAT IT'S NICE THAT 


[Captioner] 21:22:09
WE ALSO HAVE THE BUDGETS FOR 


[Captioner] 21:22:12
PICKLE BALL COURTS AND DOG PARKS 


[Captioner] 21:22:14
THAT PEOPLE HAVE BEEN ASKING 


[Captioner] 21:22:14
FOR.


[Captioner] 21:22:17
I THINK EARLIER WE HAD A COMMENT 


[Captioner] 21:22:23
ABOUT THE PAVEMENT AND THE 50-50 


[Captioner] 21:22:25
SIDEWALK REPAIRS.


[Captioner] 21:22:28
IF HANS CAN MAYBE ELABORATE A 


[Captioner] 21:22:29
LITTLE BIT ON THAT.


[Captioner] 21:22:30
BECAUSE I KNOW THAT IN THE LAST 


[Captioner] 21:22:33
FEW YEARS WE HAD SOME PAST DUE 


[Captioner] 21:22:36
LIKE SEVERELY KIND OF SEVERE 


[Captioner] 21:22:37
CONDITIONS THAT HAVEN'T BEEN 


[Captioner] 21:22:39
ABLE TO HAVE THOSE REPAIRS.


[Captioner] 21:22:40
SO WE'VE BEEN KIND OF LIKE 


[Captioner] 21:22:43
STACKING UP AND DELAYED ON THOSE 


[Captioner] 21:22:45
PROJECTS, IS THAT CORRECT?


[Captioner] 21:22:47
>> Hans Larsen:   YES, WE HAVE 


[Captioner] 21:22:48
MADE SORT OF STEADY PROGRESS 


[Captioner] 21:22:50
OVER THE YEARS WITH SIDEWALK 


[Captioner] 21:22:52
REPAIRS AND THEN I THINK WITH 


[Captioner] 21:22:54
WHAT'S PROPOSED IN THIS CIP, AND 


[Captioner] 21:22:56
WITH ADDITIONAL STAFF RESOURCES, 


[Captioner] 21:22:57
WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO MAKE 


[Captioner] 21:22:59
MORE PROGRESS THAN WE HAVE IN 


[Captioner] 21:23:00
THE PAST.


[Captioner] 21:23:01
>> Councilmember Keng:   GREAT, 


[Captioner] 21:23:01
GREAT.


[Captioner] 21:23:03
SO I KNOW THAT WE HAVE ALWAYS 


[Captioner] 21:23:05
HAD THOSE KIND OF MORE URGENT 


[Captioner] 21:23:08
STREETS THAT WE NEED TO WORK ON 


[Captioner] 21:23:09
PAVEMENT AND SO THERE'S LIKE 


[Captioner] 21:23:12
KIND OF CATEGORIES AND YOU'VE 


[Captioner] 21:23:14
BEEN WORKING THROUGH THOSE 


[Captioner] 21:23:14
DIFFERENT CATEGORIES.


[Captioner] 21:23:15
RIGHT?


[Captioner] 21:23:16
>> Hans Larsen:   THAT'S 


[Captioner] 21:23:17
CORRECT.


[Captioner] 21:23:17
>> Councilmember Keng:   ALL 


[Captioner] 21:23:18
RIGHT, THANK YOU VERY MUCH, 


[Captioner] 21:23:23
THAT'S ALL MY COMMENTS.


[Captioner] 21:23:23
>> Mayor Mei:   COUNCILMEMBER 


[Captioner] 21:23:23
SALWAN.


[Captioner] 21:23:25
>> Councilmember Salwan:   THANK 


[Captioner] 21:23:27
YOU MADAM MAYOR AND THANK YOU, 


[Captioner] 21:23:29
TO ALL OF YOU FOR A WONDERFUL 


[Captioner] 21:23:31
PRESENTATION AS EXCITING AS 


[Captioner] 21:23:33
ALWAYS FOR US PEOPLE THAT LIKE 


[Captioner] 21:23:35
FINANCE.


[Captioner] 21:23:38
ONE THING THAT I DIDN'T SEE IN 


[Captioner] 21:23:39
THIS CIP WAS THE PAVEMENT 


[Captioner] 21:23:39
CONDITION INDEX.


[Captioner] 21:23:41
I KNOW WE LOVE TO TALK ABOUT 


[Captioner] 21:23:42
THAT.


[Captioner] 21:23:43
AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE 


[Captioner] 21:23:45
CURRENT STATUS IS COMPARED TO 


[Captioner] 21:23:45
BEFORE.


[Captioner] 21:23:47
BUT IF YOU COULD KIND OF COMMENT 


[Captioner] 21:23:49
ON THAT.


[Captioner] 21:23:50
>> Hans Larsen:   YES.


[Captioner] 21:23:52
SO WE -- I THINK THAT THERE'S IN 


[Captioner] 21:23:54
THE OPERATING BUDGET THERE MAY 


[Captioner] 21:23:56
BE SOME NUMBERS ON, YOU KNOW, 


[Captioner] 21:23:57
WHERE WE'RE AT.


[Captioner] 21:23:59
BUT, YOU KNOW, THERE'S BEEN A 


[Captioner] 21:24:00
SIGNIFICANT LEVEL OF PROGRESS 


[Captioner] 21:24:03
THAT FREMONT HAS MADE OVER THE 


[Captioner] 21:24:04
LAST DECADE.


[Captioner] 21:24:06
AND IF I'M RECALLING RIGHT, YOU 


[Captioner] 21:24:08
KNOW, OUR PAVEMENT CONDITION 


[Captioner] 21:24:12
INDEX TEN YEARS AGO WAS LIKE 60, 


[Captioner] 21:24:14
62, 63.


[Captioner] 21:24:17
AND WE'RE NOW AT LIKE A 72 


[Captioner] 21:24:18
LEVEL.


[Captioner] 21:24:19
WHEREAS BEFORE WE WERE BEHIND 


[Captioner] 21:24:22
THE BAY AREA AVERAGE, WE'RE NOW 


[Captioner] 21:24:24
ABOVE THE BAY AREA AVERAGE.


[Captioner] 21:24:25
SO THAT'S A GOOD PLACE TO BE.


[Captioner] 21:24:29
THE OTHER METRIC THAT WE USE IS, 


[Captioner] 21:24:31
THE NUMBER, THE PERCENTAGE OF 


[Captioner] 21:24:33
STREETS THAT ARE IN POOR 


[Captioner] 21:24:34
CONDITION.


[Captioner] 21:24:36
AND THAT HAS ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY 


[Captioner] 21:24:37
DECLINED.


[Captioner] 21:24:39
SO NOT ONLY ARE WE -- THE 


[Captioner] 21:24:42
AVERAGE CONDITION IMPROVING BUT 


[Captioner] 21:24:43
THE NUMBER OF STREETS THAT ARE 


[Captioner] 21:24:44
IN POOR CONDITION IS ALSO 


[Captioner] 21:24:45
DECLINING.


[Captioner] 21:24:47
AND SO THOSE ARE -- I THINK 


[Captioner] 21:24:49
WE'RE MOVING IN THE RIGHT 


[Captioner] 21:24:50
DIRECTION AND I THINK WHAT'S 


[Captioner] 21:24:52
EXCITING ABOUT WHAT WE'RE ABLE 


[Captioner] 21:24:55
TO DO WITH THIS PROPOSED BUDGET 


[Captioner] 21:24:59
IS LOOK AT SORT OF NOT EVERY 


[Captioner] 21:25:01
STREET IS SORT OF EQUAL IN TERMS 


[Captioner] 21:25:03
OF ITS PRIORITY OR LEVEL OF 


[Captioner] 21:25:05
VISIBILITY.


[Captioner] 21:25:07
AND SO THE INVESTMENTS THAT WE 


[Captioner] 21:25:11
HAVE WILL INCREASE THE OVERALL 


[Captioner] 21:25:12
PAVEMENT CONDITION INDEX BUT 


[Captioner] 21:25:18
WILL INCREASE IT IN AREAS THAT 


[Captioner] 21:25:20
COUNCIL HAS SAID IS IMPORTANT.


[Captioner] 21:25:21
OUR COMMERCIAL DISTRICTS, THE 


[Captioner] 21:25:23
GATEWAY STREELS STREETS, THE 


[Captioner] 21:25:26
MOST TRAFFIC, EYES ON IT, WE'RE 


[Captioner] 21:25:28
GOING TO BE TRACKING THE 


[Captioner] 21:25:29
PAVEMENT CONDITION INDEX FOR 


[Captioner] 21:25:31
THAT CLASS OF PRIORITY TREATS 


[Captioner] 21:25:32
AND WE'LL SEE THAT CONDITION 


[Captioner] 21:25:34
IMPROVING AS WELL.


[Captioner] 21:25:34
>> Councilmember Salwan:   THANK 


[Captioner] 21:25:34
YOU.


[Captioner] 21:25:38
AND I THINK IN 2016 OR 2017, WE 


[Captioner] 21:25:40
HAD ALLOCATED FUNDING FOR THE 


[Captioner] 21:25:41
100 WORST SIDEWALKS.


[Captioner] 21:25:44
AND SO DID WE EVER HIT ALL 100 


[Captioner] 21:25:46
OF THOSE OR ARE WE STILL 


[Captioner] 21:25:48
CHIPPING AWAY AT THAT?


[Captioner] 21:25:49
>> Hans Larsen:   YES, THAT 


[Captioner] 21:25:51
PROGRAM WAS TO DO THE 100 WORST 


[Captioner] 21:25:52
EACH YEAR.


[Captioner] 21:25:53
AND SO WE'VE BEEN DOING THAT FOR 


[Captioner] 21:25:55
FIVE OR SIX YEARS.


[Captioner] 21:25:56
>> Councilmember Salwan:   GOOD.


[Captioner] 21:25:58
>> Hans Larsen:   BUT WE'VE HAD, 


[Captioner] 21:26:00
YOU KNOW, SEVEN, 800 REALLY BAD 


[Captioner] 21:26:01
SIDEWALKS.


[Captioner] 21:26:02
>> Councilmember Salwan:   NICE.


[Captioner] 21:26:03
>> Hans Larsen:   SO THE GOOD 


[Captioner] 21:26:05
NEWS IS THAT WE'RE SEEING THE 


[Captioner] 21:26:07
LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL 


[Captioner] 21:26:09
THAT WITHIN TWO YEARS WHAT WE'VE 


[Captioner] 21:26:14
CLASSIFIED AS SIDEWALKS IN A 


[Captioner] 21:26:15
SEVERELY DAMAGED CONDITION WILL 


[Captioner] 21:26:17
HAVE ALL BEEN COMPLETED.


[Captioner] 21:26:18
AND THEN WE'RE THOUSAND ABLE TO 


[Captioner] 21:26:20
MOVE INTO KIND OF WHAT, YOU 


[Captioner] 21:26:24
KNOW, SORT OF MODERATELY DAMAGED 


[Captioner] 21:26:24
SIDEWALKS.


[Captioner] 21:26:27
AND WE'LL LOOK AT I THINK OUR 


[Captioner] 21:26:28
ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION PLAN WILL 


[Captioner] 21:26:32
HELP SORT OF DEFINE WHERE IN 


[Captioner] 21:26:39
FREMONT WE HAVE SIDEWALK 


[Captioner] 21:26:40
CONDITION ISSUES OF CONCERN.


[Captioner] 21:26:41
WE'LL LOOK TO BE RESPONSIVE TO 


[Captioner] 21:26:43
THAT.


[Captioner] 21:26:47
BUT THE GOOD NUNS IS WE'RE GOING 


[Captioner] 21:26:49
TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO MAKE 


[Captioner] 21:26:51
SOME GOOD PROGRESS.


[Captioner] 21:26:51
>> Councilmember Salwan:   


[Captioner] 21:26:51
EXCELLENT.


[Captioner] 21:26:52
EXCELLENT.


[Captioner] 21:26:54
I WAS EXCITED TO SEE THE AUTO 


[Captioner] 21:26:59
MALL PROJECT IN THE CPI, WE 


[Captioner] 21:27:01
TALKED ABOUT I CALL IT THE 


[Captioner] 21:27:03
MIRACLE MILE BETWEEN 680 AND 880 


[Captioner] 21:27:05
WHERE WE CONNECT -- OUR FINANCE 


[Captioner] 21:27:08
DIRECTOR LOVES SALES TAX AND I 


[Captioner] 21:27:09
LOVE SALES TAX.


[Captioner] 21:27:11
SO FROM WALMART TO AUTO MALL I 


[Captioner] 21:27:12
THINK THAT'S A GREAT ADDITION I 


[Captioner] 21:27:15
THINK THAT WILL HOPEFULLY BRING 


[Captioner] 21:27:16
MORE PEOPLE TO FREMONT.


[Captioner] 21:27:17
VERY BUSY CORRIDOR.


[Captioner] 21:27:20
I DID LIKE SOME OF THE IDEAS 


[Captioner] 21:27:22
BECAUSE I SEE SUCH A LARGE AREA 


[Captioner] 21:27:24
IN THE CENTER, LIKE HOW DO YOU 


[Captioner] 21:27:26
PURPOSE THAT OR HOW DO YOU 


[Captioner] 21:27:27
BEAUTIFY THAT.


[Captioner] 21:27:29
I THINK YOU'LL HAVE GOOD IDEAS 


[Captioner] 21:27:31
BUT IT WILL BE NICE TO SEE WHAT 


[Captioner] 21:27:32
KIND OF THINGS CAN BE DONE IN 


[Captioner] 21:27:33
THAT AREA.


[Captioner] 21:27:35
THE COMMUNITY CENTER AT CENTRAL 


[Captioner] 21:27:36
PARK I THINK THAT'S FANTASTIC.


[Captioner] 21:27:37
I STILL WORRY ABOUT THE 


[Captioner] 21:27:39
OCCUPANCY.


[Captioner] 21:27:40
YOU KNOW, THE ONE HERE IN 


[Captioner] 21:27:42
DOWNTOWN A LOT OF FOLKS SAY THAT 


[Captioner] 21:27:43
THEY NEED MORE CAPACITY.


[Captioner] 21:27:45
AND SO IF THERE'S A WAY TO 


[Captioner] 21:27:46
INCREASE THE SIZE, I THINK THAT 


[Captioner] 21:27:48
WOULD GO A LONG WAY.


[Captioner] 21:27:49
I FORGET THE NUMBER.


[Captioner] 21:27:51
I THINK IT'S LIKE 150 IN ONE 


[Captioner] 21:27:54
HAUL AND I THINK IS IT 50 IN THE 


[Captioner] 21:27:55
OTHER ONE?


[Captioner] 21:27:57
IS THERE A WAY TO EITHER JOIN 


[Captioner] 21:27:59
THOSE OR HOPEFULLY INCREASE THE 


[Captioner] 21:28:00
CAPACITY AT CENTRAL PARK.


[Captioner] 21:28:02
EVEN IF WE HAVE TO WAIT A LITTLE 


[Captioner] 21:28:04
LONGER BUT I THINK WE CAN TRY 


[Captioner] 21:28:07
INCREASE THE CAPACITY SO WE CAN 


[Captioner] 21:28:08
GET 400 PEOPLE OR SO SOMEHOW 


[Captioner] 21:28:10
TRYING TO COMBINE THE DIFFERENT 


[Captioner] 21:28:12
AREAS SO WE CAN GET MORE PEOPLE 


[Captioner] 21:28:13
IN ONE AREA WOULD GO A LONG WAYS 


[Captioner] 21:28:15
TO HELP THE COMMUNITY'S UNMET 


[Captioner] 21:28:16
NEED.


[Captioner] 21:28:18
A LOT OF FOLKS ARE GOING TO 


[Captioner] 21:28:19
DIFFERENT CITIES FOR A LOT OF 


[Captioner] 21:28:21
THESE EVENTS AND I THINK WE HAVE 


[Captioner] 21:28:23
A LOT OF DEMAND FOR THAT.


[Captioner] 21:28:25
SO HOPEFULLY, STAFF CAN LOOK AT 


[Captioner] 21:28:29
THAT.


[Captioner] 21:28:31
GREAT JOB ON THE RESTROOMS AND 


[Captioner] 21:28:33
LAST BUT NOT LEAST WE HAVE THREE 


[Captioner] 21:28:34
COUNCIL PRIORITIES AND THIS KIND 


[Captioner] 21:28:35
OF GOES WITH THE GENERAL FUND AS 


[Captioner] 21:28:36
WELL AND THE CIP.


[Captioner] 21:28:38
WE TALK ABOUT HOMELESSNESS WE 


[Captioner] 21:28:40
ARE DOING A LOT, PUBLIC SAFETY 


[Captioner] 21:28:41
WE'RE DOING A LOT.


[Captioner] 21:28:43
I'D LIKE TO SEE IF THERE IS A 


[Captioner] 21:28:45
WAY WE CAN CARVE OUT A SMALL 


[Captioner] 21:28:46
AREA FOR SUPPORTING 


[Captioner] 21:28:47
NEIGHBORHOODS AND COMMERCIAL 


[Captioner] 21:28:47
DISTRICTS.


[Captioner] 21:28:49
I KNOW WE CAN'T DO EVERYTHING 


[Captioner] 21:28:51
BUT WE CAN DO A FEW THINGS.


[Captioner] 21:28:53
SO IF THERE'S ANY OPPORTUNITY TO 


[Captioner] 21:28:55
TRY TO HELP SOME OF THESE 


[Captioner] 21:28:57
COMMERCIAL DISTRICTS OR TRY 


[Captioner] 21:28:59
REVITALIZE SOME OF OUR KEY AREAS 


[Captioner] 21:29:01
I THINK THAT WOULD GO A LONG 


[Captioner] 21:29:01
WAY.


[Captioner] 21:29:03
MAYBE NOT ALL AT ONCE BUT MAYBE 


[Captioner] 21:29:05
OVER A FEW YEAR CYCLE THAT WE 


[Captioner] 21:29:07
CAN VISIBLY SHOW THE COMMUNITY 


[Captioner] 21:29:09
WHAT WE HAVE DONE OVER HOPEFULLY 


[Captioner] 21:29:11
A SHORT TIME, THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 21:29:11
THANK YOU SO MUCH, REALLY 


[Captioner] 21:29:13
APPRECIATE IT, LOOK FORWARD TO 


[Captioner] 21:29:15
FURTHER DISCUSSIONS.


[Captioner] 21:29:16
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 21:29:17
NEXT IS COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL.


[Captioner] 21:29:20
>> Councilmember Campbell:   I 


[Captioner] 21:29:22
JUST HAVE ONE QUICK FOLLOW-UP 


[Captioner] 21:29:24
ABOUT THE RESTROOMS.


[Captioner] 21:29:27
IS IT THOSE ARE IN PARKS AND 


[Captioner] 21:29:31
GENERALLY YOU HAVE A MALE AND A 


[Captioner] 21:29:31
FEMALE BATHROOM.


[Captioner] 21:29:34
SIT POSSIBLE TO HAVE GENDER 


[Captioner] 21:29:36
NEUTRAL BEDROOMS IN THOSE 11 


[Captioner] 21:29:43
PARKS THAT HAVE BEEN MENTIONED?


[Captioner] 21:29:46
>> SO THE PUBLIC WORKS STAFF 


[Captioner] 21:29:47
WILL BE DOING AN ASSESSMENT OF 


[Captioner] 21:29:50
ALL OF THE PARKS DETERMINING 


[Captioner] 21:29:52
WHICH WILL NEED TO BE REDESIGNED 


[Captioner] 21:29:54
VERSUS REDEVELOPED VERSUS 


[Captioner] 21:29:54
UPDATED.


[Captioner] 21:29:56
SO THAT WILL DETERMINE THE 


[Captioner] 21:29:57
OUTCOME TO YOUR QUESTION AND 


[Captioner] 21:29:58
ONCE WE HAVE THAT INFORMATION WE 


[Captioner] 21:29:59
CAN BRING THAT BACK TO YOU AT 


[Captioner] 21:30:00
THAT TIME.


[Captioner] 21:30:00
>> Councilmember Campbell:   


[Captioner] 21:30:01
THAT WOULD BE GREAT.


[Captioner] 21:30:03
BECAUSE I DO THINK THAT IT'S 


[Captioner] 21:30:06
FORTUNATE TO HAVE GENDER NEUTRAL 


[Captioner] 21:30:07
BATHROOMS AS WELL AND I THINK 


[Captioner] 21:30:08
WHAT'S BEEN MENTIONED HERE BY 


[Captioner] 21:30:11
SEVERAL OF US THAT THAT THAT 


[Captioner] 21:30:13
MIGHT BE AN IMPORTANT PRIORITY 


[Captioner] 21:30:14
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 21:30:18
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU FOR 


[Captioner] 21:30:19
THIS PRESENTATION AND FOR THE 


[Captioner] 21:30:20
 


[Captioner] 21:30:21
REPORT.


[Captioner] 21:30:22
I KNOW THIS IS SOMETHING THAT 


[Captioner] 21:30:23
WILL COME BACK FOR THE PUBLIC 


[Captioner] 21:30:24
HEARING.


[Captioner] 21:30:26
REAL QUICKLY FOR THE PAVEMENT 


[Captioner] 21:30:27
CONDITION INDEX I DON'T THINK WE 


[Captioner] 21:30:30
HAVE THE NEW ONE YET FOR 2022, I 


[Captioner] 21:30:32
THINK IT COMES OUT IN THE FALL.


[Captioner] 21:30:35
I KNOW MTC, METROPOLITAN 


[Captioner] 21:30:36
TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION KEEPS 


[Captioner] 21:30:37
THAT.


[Captioner] 21:30:39
ONE OF OUR CHALLENGES JUST TO 


[Captioner] 21:30:39
LET EVERYONE IN THE AUDIENCE OR 


[Captioner] 21:30:41
PEOPLE WHO ARE WATCHING KNOW IS 


[Captioner] 21:30:43
THAT WE HAVE SOME OF THE MOST 


[Captioner] 21:30:45
LANE MILES, I THINK THAT ONLY 


[Captioner] 21:30:46
NEXT TO SOME OF THE OTHER 


[Captioner] 21:30:48
COUNTIES DO WE HAVE MORE LANE 


[Captioner] 21:30:51
MILES TO COVER, TO MAINTAIN.


[Captioner] 21:30:54
AND I THINK MTC KEEPS WHAT THEY 


[Captioner] 21:30:56
CALL A THREE YEAR ROLLING 


[Captioner] 21:30:58
AVERAGE SO THAT'S WHY OURS WENT 


[Captioner] 21:31:00
DOWN ONE POINT LAST YEAR BUT I 


[Captioner] 21:31:01
KNOW IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'RE 


[Captioner] 21:31:05
WORKING ALL AND STRIVING TO 


[Captioner] 21:31:05
CONTINUE.


[Captioner] 21:31:07
FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE THAT HAS 


[Captioner] 21:31:09
SOME STANDARDIZATION AND THAT 


[Captioner] 21:31:13
GIVES A BALANCED RUBRIC NOT JUST 


[Captioner] 21:31:15
OUR PERSPECTIVE BUT WHAT AN 


[Captioner] 21:31:17
OVERALL DISCUSSION IS IN TERMS 


[Captioner] 21:31:19
OF THE REVIEW OF THE ROADS.


[Captioner] 21:31:20
AS FAR AS THE RESTROOM 


[Captioner] 21:31:23
FACILITIES I WAS GOING TO SAY 


[Captioner] 21:31:24
ONE THING THAT MIGHT BE 


[Captioner] 21:31:26
IMPORTANT, GENDER NEUTRAL MIGHT 


[Captioner] 21:31:28
BE HELPFUL, AIRPORTS AND OTHER 


[Captioner] 21:31:31
PLACES THEY HAVE LIKE A FAMILY 


[Captioner] 21:31:34
TYPE ROOM, MALE-FEMALE IF YOU 


[Captioner] 21:31:36
NEED IT FOR CHANGING AND OTHER 


[Captioner] 21:31:38
THINGS IT IS A NEUTRAL FACILITY 


[Captioner] 21:31:40
BECAUSE THESE DAYS WE HAVE 


[Captioner] 21:31:41
SINGLE MOMS AND SINGLE DADS AND 


[Captioner] 21:31:43
OTHER THINGS AND SO IT HELPS IN 


[Captioner] 21:31:44
TERMS OF THE CHOICES.


[Captioner] 21:31:46
AS FOR ELECTRIFICATION I HOPE 


[Captioner] 21:31:49
THAT WE DON'T PURSUE, I KNOW 


[Captioner] 21:31:51
THERE'S THE UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY 


[Captioner] 21:31:53
WITH INFRASTRUCTURE BILLS THAT 


[Captioner] 21:31:56
ARE COMING IN WITH FUNNELEDDINGS 


[Captioner] 21:31:57
THAT WE ARE SECURING THOSE AND 


[Captioner] 21:31:59
WE ARE PARTNERING WITH ENTITIES 


[Captioner] 21:32:00
SUCH AS STATE AND FEDERAL TO BE 


[Captioner] 21:32:02
ABLE TO SECURE THOSE GRANTS AND 


[Captioner] 21:32:04
ALSO I KNOW I APPRECIATE WE 


[Captioner] 21:32:06
MENTIONED EARLIER TONIGHT 


[Captioner] 21:32:07
WHETHER IT IS FOR SOME OF THE 


[Captioner] 21:32:08
FACILITIES OR THE COMMUNITY 


[Captioner] 21:32:11
CENTERS OR THE BROADBAND AND 


[Captioner] 21:32:13
OTHER THINGS, WE HAVE BEEN 


[Captioner] 21:32:15
WRITING LETTERS TO OUR 


[Captioner] 21:32:16
LEGISLATORS TO HAVE THEM 


[Captioner] 21:32:18
EARMARKED TO ENSURE THAT THE 


[Captioner] 21:32:20
FUNDING IS BEING FOCUSED ON 


[Captioner] 21:32:21
THOSE KEY AREAS BECAUSE WE 


[Captioner] 21:32:22
CERTAINLY CAN'T MAKE THOSE 


[Captioner] 21:32:23
FUNDING AND THOSE PROJECTS 


[Captioner] 21:32:25
WITHOUT THE SUPPORT OF THOSE 


[Captioner] 21:32:27
LEGISLATORS, SUPPORT AND FRANKLY 


[Captioner] 21:32:29
IT IS OUR TAXPAYERS' MONEY SO 


[Captioner] 21:32:31
THEY SHOULD BE GIVING IT BACK TO 


[Captioner] 21:32:32
US TO ENSURE THAT THOSE PROJECTS 


[Captioner] 21:32:34
ARE BEING MET.


[Captioner] 21:32:36
SO HOPEFULLY WE GET GOOD 


[Captioner] 21:32:37
ADVOCATES AND CHAMPIONS IN THOSE 


[Captioner] 21:32:39
AREAS.


[Captioner] 21:32:40
AS FAR AS ELECTRIFICATION, I 


[Captioner] 21:32:42
ALSO WOULD LOVE TO SEE, I THINK 


[Captioner] 21:32:44
WE HAVE DONE THAT WITH 


[Captioner] 21:32:46
ELECTRIFICATION OR ANY OF THESE 


[Captioner] 21:32:48
OTHER PROJECTS, I TRULY BELIEVE 


[Captioner] 21:32:50
IN LOCAL HIRE AND LOCAL SUPPORT, 


[Captioner] 21:32:52
WE ARE SO BLESSED TO HAVE SO 


[Captioner] 21:32:53
MANY COMPANIES THAT ARE 


[Captioner] 21:32:54
REPRESENTING THESE AREAS IN 


[Captioner] 21:32:55
TECHNOLOGY.


[Captioner] 21:32:57
IT IS A GREAT WAY FOR US WHETHER 


[Captioner] 21:32:59
IT IS FOR OUR FIRE STATIONS OR 


[Captioner] 21:33:01
OTHER AREAS TO BE ABLE TO 


[Captioner] 21:33:02
SHOWCASE OUR LOCAL MANUFACTURING 


[Captioner] 21:33:05
AND SUPPORT AND OWN TECHNOLOGY.


[Captioner] 21:33:07
AND AS FAR AS COMPLETE STREETS, 


[Captioner] 21:33:10
I KNOW THAT WE HAVE MADE SO MANY 


[Captioner] 21:33:12
PLANS AND I WANT TO THANK ALL OF 


[Captioner] 21:33:14
YOU AND YOUR STAFF WHETHER IT'S 


[Captioner] 21:33:20
THE MASTER PARK PLANS, THE 


[Captioner] 21:33:22
MASTER STREETS, THE ACTIVE 


[Captioner] 21:33:23
TRANSPORTATION MASTER PLAN I 


[Captioner] 21:33:25
THINK THAT'S WHERE WE BRING IN 


[Captioner] 21:33:27
THE HOLISTIC VIEWS IN TERMS OF 


[Captioner] 21:33:28
HOW TO BRING ALL THIS TOGETHER.


[Captioner] 21:33:30
I KNOW IT'S A LOT FOR US TO 


[Captioner] 21:33:33
COVER AS A CITY BUT I APPRECIATE 


[Captioner] 21:33:35
MY COUNCILMEMBERS SERVING ON 


[Captioner] 21:33:37
COMMITTEES TO BRING THOSE 


[Captioner] 21:33:38
PERSPECTIVES.


[Captioner] 21:33:39
THAT'S ABOUT IT.


[Captioner] 21:33:40
WE LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING BACK 


[Captioner] 21:33:42
FROM YOU ON THE NEXT STEPS AND I 


[Captioner] 21:33:44
ALSO ENCOURAGE THE PUBLIC TO BE 


[Captioner] 21:33:45
PARTICIPANTS IN THIS 


[Captioner] 21:33:47
PROCESS.THIS IS A SUMMARY OF OUR 


[Captioner] 21:33:49
CITY'S INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS AND 


[Captioner] 21:33:50
UNFORTUNATELY AS ALWAYS THE 


[Captioner] 21:33:52
NEEDS OUTWEIGH THE FUNDING AND 


[Captioner] 21:33:54
WHERE WE CAN BE THOUGHTFUL I WAS 


[Captioner] 21:33:56
GOING TO SAY ALSO THINGS TON 


[Captioner] 21:33:58
ROOF WE'RE LOOKING AT 


[Captioner] 21:33:59
POSSIBILITIES AND I KNOW TODAY 


[Captioner] 21:34:00
THERE WAS SOME POLICE REPORTS 


[Captioner] 21:34:02
THAT WENT OUT AND WHEN WE ARE 


[Captioner] 21:34:03
LOOKING AT THE ROOF 


[Captioner] 21:34:05
INFRASTRUCTURE AND THINGS 


[Captioner] 21:34:08
BESIDES THE FACT OF BEING ENERGY 


[Captioner] 21:34:09
EFFICIENT OTHER WAYS IF THERE'S 


[Captioner] 21:34:11
ANY OTHER PROJECTS WHETHER IT'S 


[Captioner] 21:34:12
FOR IMPROVEMENTS OF OUR CITY 


[Captioner] 21:34:14
FACILITIES OR OUR 


[Captioner] 21:34:15
ELECTRIFICATION IN OTHER AREAS 


[Captioner] 21:34:17
WHERE WE CAN COMBINE THE USAGE 


[Captioner] 21:34:19
OF IN TERMS OF TRYING TO BE MORE 


[Captioner] 21:34:23
THOUGHTFUL AND FAJING -- AND 


[Captioner] 21:34:24
PACKAGINGS SOME OF THE WORK 


[Captioner] 21:34:26
THAT'S BEING DONE AND SAVING US 


[Captioner] 21:34:27
ON COSTS I'M ALWAYS INTERESTED 


[Captioner] 21:34:28
IN THAT.


[Captioner] 21:34:29
AND I ALSO SUPPORT THE IDEA OF 


[Captioner] 21:34:31
THE AUTO MALL PIECE OF IT IN 


[Captioner] 21:34:33
TERMS OF LOOKING AT DIFFERENT 


[Captioner] 21:34:34
WAYS TO UTILIZE BUT ONE OF THE 


[Captioner] 21:34:36
CHALLENGES THAT PEOPLE DON'T 


[Captioner] 21:34:38
REALIZE IT IS ABUSE TO HAVE 


[Captioner] 21:34:40
BUTTE PHYSICS OR OTHER USAGE BUT 


[Captioner] 21:34:42
THERE IS THE ONGOING MAINTENANCE 


[Captioner] 21:34:43
COST AS WELL AS THE OPERATIONAL 


[Captioner] 21:34:45
COST THAT'S BECOME A FACTOR TOO.


[Captioner] 21:34:47
SO IF WE COULD BALANCE THOSE TWO 


[Captioner] 21:34:48
THOSE WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT'S 


[Captioner] 21:34:50
IMPORTANT.


[Captioner] 21:34:52
SO I THINK DID I -- WE WENT 


[Captioner] 21:34:54
THROUGH ALL THE PUBLIC SPEAKERS.


[Captioner] 21:34:57
WE WENT THROUGH THIS DEMAND AND 


[Captioner] 21:34:59
I THINK NEXT IS JUST ARE THERE 


[Captioner] 21:35:02
ANY REPORT-OUTS?


[Captioner] 21:35:04
FROM ANY OF THE COUNCILMEMBERS?


[Captioner] 21:35:06
I WANTED TO QUICKLY REPORT OUT 


[Captioner] 21:35:07
AND JUST SHARE AND I KNOW SOME 


[Captioner] 21:35:08
OF THE COUNCILMEMBERS HAD A 


[Captioner] 21:35:11
CHANCE TO STOP BY THAT THIS IS 


[Captioner] 21:35:12
AFFORDABLE HOUSING MONTH AND I 


[Captioner] 21:35:14
WANT TO THANK COUNCILMEMBER 


[Captioner] 21:35:16
SALWAN, COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL 


[Captioner] 21:35:18
AND VICE MAYOR COX FOR STOPPING 


[Captioner] 21:35:19
BY.


[Captioner] 21:35:21
I KNOW WE WERE ABLE TO OPEN UP 


[Captioner] 21:35:23
GRANITE RIDGE AND THAT IS 


[Captioner] 21:35:24
SOMETHING WE ARE SUPPORTIVE OF 


[Captioner] 21:35:25
IN TERMS OF CREATING MORE 


[Captioner] 21:35:26
OPPORTUNITIES FOR AFFORDABLE 


[Captioner] 21:35:27
HOUSING AND THAT IS JUST A 


[Captioner] 21:35:29
CONTINUATION OF OUR VISION AND 


[Captioner] 21:35:30
DELIVERING SOME OF THOSE 


[Captioner] 21:35:31
CHALLENGES.


[Captioner] 21:35:32
BECAUSE WHEN IT COMES TO THINGS 


[Captioner] 21:35:34
LIKE HOMELESSNESS HOUSING IS 


[Captioner] 21:35:35
DEFINITELY ONE OF THE THINGS 


[Captioner] 21:35:36
THAT WE CAN HELP DO AND PROVIDE 


[Captioner] 21:35:38
THE WRAP AROUND SERVICES THAT 


[Captioner] 21:35:39
RELATE TO THAT.


[Captioner] 21:35:42
COUNCILMEMBER SHAO DID YOU PUSH 


[Captioner] 21:35:44

AND EVERY CITY IN OUR 


[Captioner] 21:36:19
JURISDICTION.

BUILDING BUSINESSES OR BUILDING 


[Captioner] 21:38:05
COMMUNITIES IN FREMONT IT'S NOT 


[Captioner] 21:38:06
JUST ABOUT BUILDING A PROFIT BUT 


[Captioner] 21:38:09
IT'S ABOUT BUILDING THE 


[Captioner] 21:38:11
COMMUNITIES THAT IT TAKES TO 


[Captioner] 21:38:12
SUPPORT AND RUN THEM.


[Captioner] 21:38:16
