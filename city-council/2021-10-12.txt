19:13:47  TO SPEAK THIS MONTH 
AND PROCLAIMING
19:13:50  OCTOBER AS 
CHILDREN'S ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH 
MONTH
19:13:53 .
I AM ONE AFFECTED BY THE
19:13:56  
SOUTHWEST AIRLINES
19:14:00  
CANCELLATIONS.
BECAUSE I'M NURSE AND WORK IN
19:14:04  
PUBLIC HEALTH I'LL KEEP MY MASK 
ON AS I SPEAK.

19:14:07 BUT PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF YOU 
CANNOT HEAR ME.
19:14:10 
UP MY NAME IS KATIE BOLIN, I'M
19:14:13  A 
REGISTERED NURSE, MASTERS OF
19:14:16  
PUBLIC HEALTH STUDENT,
19:14:20  AND A 
MEMBER HE CALIFORNIA
19:14:24  ANE, WE 
WOULD LIKE TO THANK

AS CHILDREN'S
19:14:41  ENVIRONMENTAL 
HEALTH MONTH.
WE THANK YOU FOR STANDING UP FOR
19:14:44  
CALIFORNIA KIDS.
AS A NURSE I KNOW WELL THAT THE 

19:14:47 AIR WATER FOOD AND CHEMICALS IN
19:14:51  
OUR EVERYDAY PRODUCTS, AS WELL 
AS CLIMATE CHANGE CAN
19:14:54  GREATLY 
AFFECT THE HEALTH OF CHILDREN IN 
THIS STATE.
19:14:56 
HOWEVER, I BELIEVE THAT NO 
PARENTS SHOULD HAVE TO WORRY 

19:15:00 ABOUT THEIR ENVIRONMENT BRINGING 
HARM TO THEIR CHILD'S HEALTH AND
19:15:03  
NO PARENT SHOULD HAVE TO WORRY 
MORE ABOUT THEIR CHILD'S HEALTH
19:15:07  
THAN THEIR MORE PRIVILEGED 
COUNTERPARTS.
19:15:09 
THAT IS WHY THE TIME TO ACT IS 
NOW.

19:15:12 CHILDREN ARE OUR FUTURE AND THEY 
DESERVE TO HAVE A FUTURE THAT IS 
HEALTHY
19:15:15 , EQUITABLE AND 
SUSTAINABILITY.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND 

19:15:23 COMMITMENT TO THIS CAUSE.

19:31:02 
>> GOOD EVENING, MAYOR MEI, 
REALLY
19:31:05  LOOK FORWARD TO ACTUALLY 
MEETING IN PERSON INSTEAD OF OUR 
ZOOM
19:31:08 S.
THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME THIS 
OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE
19:31:12  A BRIEF 
UPDATE OF THE STATE 
LEGISLATURE'S ACTIONS
19:31:16 , AND MY 
LEGISLATIVE AGENDA IN THE FIRST 
HALF OF THIS
19:31:19  TWO-YEAR SESSION.
I KNOW THAT WE HAVE LIMITED 
TIME.

19:31:22 SO I'LL GET RIGHT TO IT.
MUCH OF THE LEGISLATURE'S WORK
19:31:25  
THIS YEAR WAS OBVIOUSLY FOCUSED
19:31:28  
ON HELPING CALIFORNIA BOUNCE 
BACK IN RESPONSE TO THE
19:31:32  COVID-19 
PANDEMIC.
BUT WE ALSO REBUILT OUR ECONOMY
19:31:35  
AND WE WORK TO MAKE IT MORE 
EQUITABLE
19:31:39  THAN -- THAN A JUST 
RECOVERY HAD
19:31:43  PREVIOUSLY BEEN IN 
THE PAST.
WE'VE ALSO WORKED TO MAKE AN
19:31:46  
UNPRECEDENTED INVESTMENT OF $15 
BILLION IN
19:31:49  OUR CLIMATE CHANGE 
PACKAGE, IN PROGRAMS
19:31:52  THAT 
PREVENT AND MITIGATE WHAT
19:31:55  
WILDFIRES CONFRONT OUR DROUGHT 
AND TRANSITION CALIFORNIA TO
19:31:59  A 
ZERO-EMISSION VEHICLES SOCIETY
19:32:02  
AS WE CURB OUR GREENHOUSE GASES
19:32:05  
AND AS LOVELY AS THE 
PRESENTATION ON HOW FREMONT'S 

19:32:08 LEADING THE WAY.
NOW SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE 
COVID-19
19:32:11  PANDEMIC, CALIFORNIA 
MOVED AGGRESSIVELY TO PROTECT
19:32:14  
PUBLIC HEALTH.
WE DID IT WITH THE SUPPORT AND 

19:32:17 COLLABORATION OF OUR PARTNERS.
THAT INCLUDES ALL OUR LOCAL 
CITIES,
19:32:20  OUR HEALTH CARE 
PROFESSIONALS AND COMMUNITY 
COMPLINGS.
19:32:24  
CLINICS.
WE'VE HAD GOOD
19:32:27  RESULTS HERE IN
19:32:30  
ALAMEDA COUNTY COMPARED TO OTHER 
AREAS.

19:32:33 75% OF ALL CALIFORNIANS ARE 
VACCINATED
19:32:37  AND ANOTHER 8% ARE 
PARTIALLY VACCINATED.
19:32:40 
WE HAVE ONE OF THE LOWEST 
POSITIVE
19:32:43 ITY RATES IN THE UNITED 
STATES DESPITE
19:32:46  OUR LARGE 
POPULATION.
AND ARE
19:32:49  LIKE NEW YORK, NEW 
JERSEY,
19:32:53  TEXAS AND FLORIDA BUT WE 
KNOW WE HAVE
19:32:56  TO REMAIN VIGILANT 
AGAINST THE DELTA VARIANT
19:32:59  AND 
OTHER VARIANTS AND CONTINUE TO 
PUSH A
19:33:02  ROBUST VACCINATION 
EFFORT.
YOU KNOW, SAD
19:33:06 LY WE'VE LOST 
70,000 CLARCHES TO COVID
19:33:09  AND 
IT'S STILL TAKING A TOLL IN 
AREAS OF
19:33:12  OUR STATES PARTICULARLY 
AMONGST THOSE THAT ARE 
UNVACCINATED
19:33:15 .
THE LEGISLATURE'S FOCUS THIS 
YEAR HAS NOT ONLY BEEN ON THE
19:33:18  
VACCINATION ROLLOUT BUT ON OUR 
ECONOMIC RECOVERY
19:33:21  FROM COVID.
AND ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE IN OUR
19:33:24 
OUR -- THE LOW-INCOME BRACKET.
CALIFORNIA
19:33:28  LEGISLATURE BACK IN 
FEBRUARY, I KNOW IT SEEMS LIKE A 
LONG TIME AGO
19:33:31 , APPROVED AND 
GOVERNOR NEWSOM
19:33:35  SIGNED AN 
IMMEDIATE RELIEF AND STIMULUS 
PACKAGE FOR FAMILIES AROUND
19:33:37  
BUSINESSES HIT HARDEST BY THE 
PANDEMIC.

19:33:40 THIS WAS CALIFORNIA'S FEBRUARY 
STIMULUS PACKAGE
19:33:44  WHICH CONSISTED 
OF $7.6
19:33:47  BILLION OF ASSISTANCE IN 
THE FORM OF FEE RELIEF, ROUND
19:33:50  
ONE OF THE GOLDEN STATE STIMULUS 
IS PAYMENTS, CHILDCARE
19:33:54  
SUBSIDIES, STUDENT AID AND AID 
TO SMALL BUSINESSES
19:33:57 .
NOW FAMILIES AND BUSINESSES THAT 
HAD
19:34:00  PREVIOUSLY QUALIFIED FOR 
STATE PROGRAMS AND FEDERAL 
RELIEF, THOSE
19:34:03  ARE THE CAL EITC
19:34:06 , 
CAL WORKS, CAL FRESH, THE
19:34:09  
STATE'S SMALL BUSINESS GRANTS 
AND THE FEDERAL PP
19:34:12 P BUSINESS 
LOANS ALL BENEFITED
19:34:16  FROM THIS 
CALIFORNIA STIMULUS AND RELIEF 
PACKAGE
19:34:19 .
WE'VE BUILT UP STABLE BUDGET 
RESERVES OVER THE
19:34:22  YEARS WITHIN 
OUR PROGRESSIVE TAX SYSTEM AND 
THIS YEAR WE'VE SEEN
19:34:25  INCREASES 
IN REVENUE, BOLSTERED IN PART BY
19:34:29  
THE FEDERAL PANDEMIC RELIEF 
WHICH ALLOWED US TO
19:34:32  PASS ON THE 
STATE'S BIGGEST
19:34:35  ECONOMIC 
RECOVERY PACKAGE IN OUR HISTORY.
SO THE BUDGET
19:34:38  INCLUDED $4 
BILLION IN GRANTS FOR THE 
INSTALL BUSINESS
19:34:42 -COVID-19 RELIEF 
PROGRAM.
NOW, I WAS ABLE
19:34:46  TO PARTNER WITH 
GOBIS AND THE
19:34:49  SMALL BUSINESS 
MAJORITY AND HAD A WORKSHOP 
EARLY ON TO
19:34:53  HELP SPREAD THE WORD 
ABOUT THE PROGRAM.
WE'VE NOW COMPLETED NINE
19:34:56  ROUNDS 
AND SENT DISTRICT
19:34:59  10, 4500 
COMPANIES RECEIVED
19:35:03  ROUGHLY $50 
MILLION IN GRANTS.
NOT LOANS, JUST
19:35:06  GRANTS THAT WE 
GAVE THEM TO TRY TO HELP THEM 
STAY IN BUSINESS.
19:35:10 
OTHER AREAS FOCUSING ON EQUITY
19:35:13  
INCLUDED TWICE, EXTENDING THE 
EVICTION MORATORIUM WHICH NOW
19:35:16  
HAS EXPIRED, EXPANDING ACCESS
19:35:19  TO 
AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE AND 
AFFORDABLE HIGHER EDUCATION, 

19:35:23 INCREASING THE NUMBER OF 
CHILDCARE SPOTS BY 200,000
19:35:26  
SLOTS.
AND A $6 BILLION INVESTMENT
19:35:29  IN 
BROADBAND TO IMPROVE BROADBAND 
INFRASTRUCTURE
19:35:32  IN UNDERSERVED 
COMMUNITIES AND REDUCED THE 
DIGITAL DIVIDE
19:35:35 .
WE KNOW THERE ARE MANY OF OUR 
STUDENTS HERE THAT JUST DON'T 

19:35:39 HAVE ACCESS TO BROADBAND IN 
THEIR HOME.
AND FINALLY,
19:35:42  WE PITCHED IN $2 
BILLION TO COVER PAST-
19:35:45 DUE WATER 
AND UTILITY BILLS.
NOW WE DID MAKE
19:35:48  THIS HISTORIC 
$15
19:35:51  BILLION CLIMATE PACKAGE AND 
THAT INCLUDED $3
19:35:55 .7 BILLION FOR 
CLIMATE RESILIENCY, $
19:35:58 4.6 BILLION 
IN WATER AND DROUGHT RELIEF, $1
19:36:02 
$1.1 BILLION IN REDUCING
19:36:05  
AGRICULTURAL IMPACTS, $140 
MILLION TO
19:36:08  BEGIN CIRCULAR 
ECONOMY AND RECYCLING ISSUES,
19:36:11  
AND 3.9 BILLION FOR ZERO 
EMISSION VEHICLES
19:36:14 .
NOW I HELPED LEAD NEGOTIATION IN 
THE
19:36:18  EARLY WILDFIRE DEAL 
PROVIDING OVER HALF A
19:36:21  BILLION 
DOLLARS EARLY OFTEN FOR WILDFIRE 
PREVENTION,
19:36:24  HOME HARDENING AND 
FIRE BRICKS AND OTHER ASSISTANCE
19:36:27 
ASSISTANCE.
IN ALL THE STATE THIS YEAR IS
19:36:30  
INVESTING $1.5 BILLION ON 
WILDFIRE
19:36:34  PREVENTION.
A DECADE AGO, WE WERE DOING 
NOTHING BECAUSE OF
19:36:37  THE PROBLEMS 
WITH THE BUDGET.
WE'RE EXTENDING
19:36:40  THE GREENHOUSE 
GAS FUND COMMITMENT TO
19:36:43  PROVIDE 
$200 MILLION AS A MINIMUM IN
19:36:47  SB 
901 WILDFIRES THROUGH BUDGET 
YEAR 2028 AND
19:36:50  2029.
THIS BIG CHANGE IS IN THE
19:36:53  AMOUNT 
IS GOING TO BE TAKEN OFF THE TOP 
SO IT'S PART OF THE 60
19:36:57 % WITH 
HIGH SPEED
19:37:00  RAIL AND THAT.
AND WHAT THAT DOES IS IT FREEZE 
UP
19:37:03 , THAT FORMULA FREEZE UP 
ANOTHER $130
19:37:06  MILLION ANNUALLY 
FOR DISCRETIONARY FUNDINGS IN 
THE BUDGET
19:37:09  AND OVER SIX YEARS 
THAT'S GOING TO BE $7
19:37:13 80 MILLION 
WHICH THE LEGISLATURE'S IN THEIR 
DISCRETION
19:37:16  CAN SPEND ON WORTHY 
GRATION REDUCE
19:37:21  
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS 
PROGRAMS.

19:37:24 WE ARE MAKING HUGE, WHEN IT 
COMES TO TRANSITION
19:37:27 ING AMERICANS 
TO ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES TO CUT
19:37:30  
THE GREENHOUSE GAS EAPPLICATIONS 
AS FREMONT
19:37:33  HAS BEEN DOING IN THE 
TRANSPORTATION
19:37:36  SECTOR.
IT IS 18% OF OUR EAPPLICATIONS 
IN
19:37:40  CALIFORNIA, WE'RE AWARE OF 
THE 40% SHARE THAT 
TRANSPORTATION
19:37:43  HAS IN TOTAL 
EMISSIONS.
SO WE'VE -- THIS YEAR
19:37:46  WE'VE PUT 
$525 MILLION
19:37:49  INTO THE VEHICLE 
REBATE PROGRAM, WHICH IS
19:37:52  AN 
EXTREMELY POPULAR PROGRAM FOR 
PEOPLE BUYING NEW CARS
19:37:55  AND EVERY 
YEAR IT RUNS OUT OF MONEY.
WE'RE ALSO INVESTING
19:37:59  IN ZERO 
EMISSION VEHICLE TRANSIT
19:38:03 , CLEAN 
TRUCKS, AND Z
19:38:06 EB SCHOOL BUSES AS 
WELL AS IS CHARGING AND FUELING
19:38:09  
INFRASTRUCTURE TO INCREASE THE 
NUMBER OF ZEB VEHICLES
19:38:13  IN 
CALIFORNIA.
NOW, LOCALLY, I'VE WORKED
19:38:16  WITH 
SEVERAL -- ON SEVERAL PROJECTS
19:38:19  
IN THE BUDGET AND THE EAST BAY 
REGIONAL PARK DISTRICT
19:38:22  IS 
SEFTION $10 MILLION AND ALSO 
SOME EQUIPMENT THAT THEY ARE
19:38:26  
GETTING, TO HELP
19:38:29  THEM FIGHT 
WILDFIRES IN THE AREA,
19:38:33  THE 
CONSERVANCY IS GETTING
19:38:36  $FIVE 
MILLION AND THE ALAMEDA COUNTY 
FLOOD CONTROL
19:38:39  DISTRICT IS 
GETTING MORE
19:38:43  MONEY FOR ALAMEDA 
AND MISSION CREEK
19:38:46 , MISSION CREEK 
RUNS INTO STIVE
19:38:50 ERS LAGOON.
IT WAS
19:38:53  MY PLEASURE TO TEAM UP 
WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER QUIRK TO 
GET
19:38:56  YOU THAT 7.2 THAT YOU NEEDED 
ON THIS MISSION
19:38:59  BOULEVARD, 
I-680.
THAT'S WHAT OUR
19:39:03  JOBS ARE, TO 
MAKE SURE THE NEEDS OF THE 
CITIES ARE MET.
19:39:06 
IN ADDITION TO THAT FREMONT IS 
GOING TO SEE IS 2.
19:39:09 1 MILLION THAT 
IS GOING TO COME INTO THE STIVE
19:39:13 
STIVERS LAGOON TO RESTORE THE 
NATURE
19:39:17  AREA IN THE PARK, YOU'VE 
GOT 2.9
19:39:20  MILLION TO WORK ON THE 
PANHANDLE PARK
19:39:23  WHICH IS ADJACENT 
TO
19:39:27  LAKE ELIZABETH ON GRIMMER, TO 
EXTEND THE
19:39:30  ACCESS TO BICYCLES, 
THE CALIFORNIA
19:39:34  ARE HISTORIC PARK 
IS GOING TO RECEIVE $2 MILLION 
FOR
19:39:37  UPGRADINGS THE VISITOR 
CENTERS AND
19:39:40  RESTORING THE 
PRESIDENT'S HOUSE IN THE NILES 
DISTRICT AND
19:39:43  $5 MILLION HAS BEEN 
AWARDED TO THE
19:39:46  MASS SCIENCE 
NUCLEUS HERE IN FREMONT TO 
REFURBISH
19:39:49  THEIR FACILITY WHICH 
HOUSES THE CHILDREN'S LOCAL
19:39:52  
NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM.
SO
19:39:56  THAT'S HOW FREMONT 
SPECIFICALLY IS BENEFITED
19:39:59 .
LASTLY, LET ME GIVE YOU A BRIEF 
ROUNDUP OF
19:40:02  MY LEGISLATIVE 
AGENDA.
FORTUNATELY THE GOVERNOR SIGNED 

19:40:06 ALL THE BILLS THAT WERE PLACED 
ON HIS DESK THIS YEAR AND IT
19:40:10  
INCLUDES, YOU KNOW, A CONTINUED 
COMMITMENT TO GROVING
19:40:13  THE STRONG 
CONSUMER PROTECTIONS THAT
19:40:17  
CALIFORNIANS DESERVE AND WHAT I 
THINK THEY EXPECT FROM
19:40:20  THEIR 
REPRESENTATIVES.
IT EXPANDS TRANSPARENCY ON 

19:40:24 WORKER AND CONSUMER RIGHTS AT A 
TIME WHEN MANY
19:40:27  PEOPLE QUITE 
FRANKLY ARE STRUGGLING AND SOME
19:40:30  
CORPORATION ARE TRYING TO TIP 
THE SCALES EVEN FURTHER IN THEIR 

19:40:33 FAVOR.
SO SENATE BILL 274 WHICH WAS 
SUPPORTED BY
19:40:36  THE CALIFORNIA 
NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS AND THE 
CALIFORNIA
19:40:40  TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION 
WILL NOW ALLOW FREMONT TO SEND
19:40:43  
OUT ELECTRONIC PACKETS TO 
MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WHO
19:40:45  
REQUEST THEM.
BEFORE THAT THE REQUIREMENTS 

19:40:48 WERE THAT YOU HAD TO ACTUALLY 
SEND PAPER PACKETS TO PEOPLE AND
19:40:52  
SOMETIMES THEY WOULDN'T ARRIVE 
UNTIL AFTER THE ACTUAL HEARING
19:40:55 .
AND THIS IS OBVIOUSLY, WHEN
19:40:59  THE 
CITIZEN REQUESTS IT.
INTE
19:41:02  531 REQUIRES COLLECTORS OF 
A DEBT THAT WAS
19:41:05  ASSIGNED TO 
THEM, NOT A DEBT THAT THEY SOLD
19:41:08  
BUT WAS ASSIGNED TO THEM TO SHOW 
PROOF THAT
19:41:11  THEY HAVE AUTHORITY 
TO COLLECT ON THE DEBT.
AND THE CONSUMER
19:41:14  PROTECTIONS 
THAT APPLY TO DEBT THAT IS SOLD 
WILL
19:41:17  ALSO APPLY IN THIS SO THE 
DEBTOR HAS PROOF OF THE
19:41:21  BASIC 
OBLIGATION,FULLY FEES THAT HAVE 
BEEN
19:41:24 , ANY FEES THAT HAVE
19:41:27  
BEEN CHARGED.
LEGAL PROVIDERS UP AND DOWN
19:41:31  THE 
STATE CAME TO ME AND SAID THIS 
WAS A
19:41:34  PROBLEM, PARTICULARLY 
CONSUMERS NOT GETTING 
INFORMATION
19:41:37  ABOUT DEBT THAT WAS 
THEIRS.
I DID A FOLLOW-UP BILL TO THE
19:41:40  
BILL I SPONSORED WITH SENATOR 
HERT
19:41:44 ZBERG SB
19:41:47  707 BACK IN 2019, 
THIS IS
19:41:50  SB 702 AND THIS 
BASICALLY ENSURES THAT ASH 
DURATION
19:41:53  COMPANIES, SOMETIMES 
THE ARBITRATION COMPANIES WOULD 
NOT SEND THE INFORMATION
19:41:57  THAT 
SOMEBODY HAS FILED A COMPLAINT 
AND ASKED THE
19:42:00  COMPANY OR THE 
CREDITOR
19:42:03  TO PAY THEIR FEES.
AND THAT NEVER STARTED THE 
PROCESS.
19:42:06 
SO PEOPLE WOULD SIT IN LIMBO.
SO WE'VE
19:42:09  GOT LANGUAGE NOW THAT 
WILL PREVENT THEM FROM 
CIRCUMVENT
19:42:12 ING THE CAUSE AND IF 
THEY
19:42:16  DON'T PAY THEIR FEES THEN 
THE MATTER WILL GO TO
19:42:19  SUPREME 
COURT AND PEOPLE WILL GET A 
JUDGMENT AGAINST FOLKS.

19:42:22 OTHER BILLS THAT WERE SIGNED 
WILL STRENGTHEN THE DEPARTMENT 
OF 
19:42:25 FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING'S 
ABILITY TO
19:42:28  PREVENT 
DISCRIMINATION IN SENATE BILL 8
19:42:31 
807 AND HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION'S
19:42:35  
BANK STAPLES ARE NOW PART OF THE 
SENATE REPORTS IN
19:42:38  SB 402 AND FOR 
ALL THE ELECTRIC VEHICLE
19:42:42  AND 
AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE FOLKS SB 5
19:42:45 72 
CHANGES OUR VEHICLE CODES SO YOU 
DON'T NEED A
19:42:48  MUFFLER ON AN 
ELECTRIC VEHICLE, YOU DON'T
19:42:52  NEED 
REARVIEW MIRRORS ON AN
19:42:57  
AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE, WE'VE GOT AN 
UPDATE ON
19:43:00  THAT ON SB 570.
I'VE EXTEND
19:43:03 ED ON TOW
19:43:07 ING, IF A 
PERSON WAS A
19:43:10  MINOR FOR LESS THAN 
SIX MONTHS IN SB 501
19:43:13 , I HAVE 
REQUIRING PUBLIC OWNED 
UTILITIES,
19:43:16  LIKE SANTA CLARA AND 
ALAMEDA, CITY OWNS
19:43:19  UTILITIES, TO 
PROVIDE FOR ALL THEIR 
TRANSPORTATION ELECTRIFICATION
19:43:23 , 
INCLUDING LIGHT, MEDIUM AND 
HEAVY DUTY AND OFF
19:43:26  AND ON-ROAD 
VEHICLES IN THEIR INTEGRATED 
RESOURCES PLAN
19:43:29  IN SB 437.
THERE WAS ANOTHER BILL THAT WE 
DIDN'T MOVE
19:43:32 .
IT WAS ACTUALLY BECAME PART OF 
THE BUDGET DEALING
19:43:35 .
INSTEAD IT WAS LONGS OVERDUE 
REFORMS FOR
19:43:38  OUR TROUBLED 
DEPARTMENT OF TOXIC SUBSTANCE 
CONTROL.
19:43:42 
THESE REFORMS WILL
19:43:45  INCREASE 
OVERSIGHT AND STABILIZE THE THE
19:43:48  
FUNDING THAT GOES INTO THE 
DEPARTMENT SO THEY CAN
19:43:52  TRACK 
DOWN ON POLLUTERS AND HOLD THE
19:43:55  
POLLUTERS ACCOUNTABLE.
ALSO CREATES FUNDING TO
19:43:58  CLEAN UP 
FUNDS ON BROWN FIELD SO EXCEPT 
TO
19:44:01  RECEIVE THAT.
I'LL JUST CONCLUDE, I HAVE ONE
19:44:04  
LAST ANNOUNCEMENT I'M GOING TO 
BE DOING AT THURSDAY
19:44:08  OCTOBER

MAYOR MEI.

19:46:55 I'M HERE WITH LUCIA HUGHES THE 
CITY'S HOUSING
19:46:59  MANAGER, WHO WILL 
BE PROVIDING A PRESENTATION ON
19:47:02  
THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING
19:47:06  
ORDINANCE.
DAVID DO
19:47:09 ZEMA
19:47:12  THE
19:47:27  THE 
KEYSER-MARSTON REPRESENTATIVE.
WE WILL GO THROUGH THE REVISIONS
19:47:31  
BEING PROPOSED AND THE PLANNING 
COMMISSION'S RECOMMENDATIONS.
19:47:34 
OUR GOAL TONIGHT IS FOR COUNCIL 
TO ADOPT THE
19:47:36  UPDATE TO THE 
ORDINANCE.
NEXT SLIDE.

19:47:45 IN 2019, COUNCIL DIRECTED STAFF 
TO
19:47:49  INITIATE AN UPDATE TO THE 
AFFORDABLE HOUSING
19:47:51  ORDINANCE 
WITH THE FOLLOWING GOALS IN 
MIND.

19:47:54 TO INCREASE RESOURCES FOR 
AFFORDABLE HOUSING,
19:47:57  TO REFLECT 
COURT DECISIONS AND CHANGES IN 
STATE LAW
19:48:00 , THAT AFFIRM THE 
CITY'S ABILITY TO REQUIRE
19:48:03  AN 
AFFORDABLE HOUSING COMPONENT IN 
BOTH RENTAL AND FOR-
19:48:07 SALE 
PROJECTS, AND TO CLARIFY
19:48:10  AND 
SIMPLIFY THE ORDINANCE WHERE WE 
COULD.

19:48:13 NEXT SLIDE, PLEASE.
19:48:17 
AS A FIRST STEP IN THE UPDATE 
PROCESS, WE COMMISSIONED
19:48:21  A NEXUS 
STUDY AND A FINANCIAL 
FEASIBILITY STUDY TO GET A
19:48:24  SENSE 
FOR WHAT LEVEL OF AFFORDABLE 
HOUSING REQUIREMENTS ARE
19:48:27  RELATED 
TO NEW DEVELOPMENT AND CAN 
FEASIBLY BE CHARGED
19:48:30 .
THEN WE HELD A STAKEHOLDER 
MEETING, AND WORK
19:48:33  SESSIONS WITH 
THE COMMISSION
19:48:37 , AND THE COUNCIL 
TO PRESENT THESE STUDIES.

19:48:40 NEXT SLIDE, PLEASE.

19:48:45 AT THE COUNCIL WORK SESSION WE 
GOT CLEAR DIRECTION THAT COUNCIL 
WANTED TO
19:48:48  RETAIN THE ABILITY FOR 
DEVELOPERS TO PAY FEES IN LIEU 
OF
19:48:51  PROVIDING ONSITE UNITS SINCE 
FEES CAN
19:48:55  SUBSIDIZE PRODUCTION OF 
LOWER-INCOME RENTAL UNITS
19:48:58 .
COUNCIL ALSO SUPPORTED 
INCREASING FEE LEVELS TO
19:49:02  THE 
EXTENT FEASIBLE TO INCREASE THE 
RESOURCE
19:49:05 S AVAILABLE FOR 
AFFORDABLE HOUSING PRODUCTION.
COUNCIL SUPPORTED A
19:49:08  PHASE-IN OF 
A REQUIREMENT TO
19:49:11  GIVE THE MARKET 
TIME TO ADJUST.
COUNCIL ALSO
19:49:14  WANTED US TO RETAIN 
THE VARIETY OF OPTIONS THAT 
EXIST
19:49:17  IN THE CURRENTS ORDINANCE, 
FOR EXAMPLE,
19:49:21  LAND DONATIONS.
YOU WANTED TO CONTINUE
19:49:24  TO 
INCENTIVIZE SMALLER MARKET RATE 
RENTAL UNITS
19:49:27  BY DISCOUNTING FEES 
ON THOSE UNITS AND FINALLY
19:49:30  
COUNCIL DIRECTED US TO SIMPLIFY 
AND CLARIFY THE
19:49:33  ORDINANCE 
WHEREVER WE COULD.
NEXT SLIDE, PLEASE.

19:49:39 JUSTING THAT DIRECTION AS WELL 
AS INFORMATION FROM THE 
TECHNICAL STUDIES
19:49:43  AND ALSO OUR 
EXPERIENCE IN ADMINISTERING THE 
CURRENT ORDINANCE
19:49:46  WE DRAFTED A 
REVISED ORDINANCE.
WE SHARED THAT
19:49:49  REVISED ORDINANCE 
AT A STAKEHOLDER MEETING THIS
19:49:52  
PAST JULY AND THEN BROUGHT IT TO 
THE PLANNING COMMISSION
19:49:55  IN 
AUGUST.
THE PLANNING COMMISSION VOTED 

19:49:59 UNANIMOUSLY THAT COUNCIL ADOPT 
THE REVISED
19:50:02  WORNS ONE CHANGE TO 
THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION THAT 
WE'LL DESCRIBE
19:50:05  LATER IN THE 
PRESENTATION.
NEXT SLIDE.

19:50:08 SO WITH THAT BY WAY OF 
BACKGROUND, WE NOW WOULD
19:50:11  LIKE TO 
WALK YOU THROUGH THE PROPOSED 
REVISIONS
19:50:14  TO THE ORDINANCE.
NEXT SLIDE, PLEASE.

19:50:18 AS WE DISCUSSED AT THE WORK 
SESSION WITH COUNCIL,
19:50:21  THERE ARE 
TWO MAIN OPTIONS UNDER THE 
CURRENT ORDINANCE
19:50:24 .
MARKET RATE DEVELOPERS CAN 
EITHER BUILD INCLUSION
19:50:27 ARY UNITS, 
OR THEY CAN PAY WHAT WE CALL AN
19:50:31  
IN LIEU FEE.
AND ONE IMPORTANT CHANGE
19:50:34  WE ARE 
PROPOSING IS TO INCREASE THE IN 
LIEU
19:50:38  FEES ON FOR SALE TOWN HOMES 
AND SINGLE
19:50:41  FAMILY HOMES FROM THE 
CURRENT LEVEL OF
19:50:44  26 OR $27 PER 
SQUARE FOOT, UP
19:50:48  TO $44 PER 
SQUARE FOOT.

19:50:51 WE ARE PROPOSING $44 PER
19:50:54  SQUARE 
FOOT BECAUSE THE FEASIBILITY 
STUDY FOUND THAT TO BE THE
19:50:57  
MAXIMUM FEE THAT COULD BE 
CHARGED ON SINGLE
19:51:00  FAMILY HOMES 
WITHOUT SUPPRESSING DEVELOPMENT
19:51:04 .
THE CONSULTANT FOUND THAT $50 
PER SQUARE FOOT
19:51:07  COULD BE CHARGED 
OR COULD BE SUPPORTED BY TOWN 
HOMES.

19:51:10 BUT STAFF IS PROPOSING TO HAVE
19:51:13  A 
SINGLE FEE OF $44 FOR
19:51:17  
ADMINISTRATIVE ASSEMBLIESITY AND 
ALSO THE
19:51:20  $44 FEE WOULD BE HIGHER 
THAN ANY
19:51:24  OF THE FEES CHARGED IN 
THE NEIGHBORING CITIES.
WE'LL SEE THE CHANGE
19:51:27  IN THIS 
LATER BUT THE ONE STAFF TO THE 
RECOMMENDATION
19:51:31  THAT PLANNING 
COMMISSION IS RECOMMENDING IS A 
HIGHER MAXIMUM IN LIEU FEE
19:51:34 .
I WOULD NOTE THAT WE ARE NOT 
RECOMMENDING ANY
19:51:38  INCREASE TO 
STACKED FLAT OR
19:51:41  EQUILIBRIUM 
OWNERSHIP
19:51:49  CONDOMINIUM 
PROJECTS MANY SINCE THE FEE 
LEVEL
19:51:52  WAS INFEASIBLE.
I WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT PER 
COUNCIL DIRECTION
19:51:55  TO PHASE IN 
THE NEW FEES WE'RE PROPOSING TO 
IMPLEMENT
19:51:58  THE FEES INCREASE IN 
TWO STEPS.
THE FIRST
19:52:02  STEP WOULD START ON 
THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE NEW 
FEE, THROUGH THE END
19:52:05  OF 2022.
WITH THE SECOND INCREASE
19:52:08  GOING 
INTO EFFECT ON JANUARY 1, 2023.

19:52:12 NEXT SLIDE PLEASE.

19:52:16 FOR RENTAL PROJECTS WE ARE NOT 
PROPOSING A FEE
19:52:20  INCREASE.
THE FEASIBILITY STUDY INDICATED
19:52:23  
THAT THE ONLY RENTAL PROJECTS 
THAT COULD FEASIBLY PAY AN 

19:52:27 INCREASED FEE WERE THOSE IN 
CLOSE PRPLTD TO
19:52:30  PROXIMITY TO
19:52:34  A TRANSIT 
STATION.
WHERE WE WANT TO ACCOMMODATE 

19:52:38 MUCH OF OUR FUTURE HOUSING NEED,
19:52:41  
STAFF'S REGISTERS IS TO LEAVE 
THE CURRENT
19:52:44  RENTAL FEE 
UNCHANGED.
WE ARE PROPOSING TO RETAIN THE 

19:52:48 DISCOUNTED FEES FOR SMALLER 
RENTAL UNITS BECAUSE
19:52:51  THOSE UNITS 
TEND TO BE MORE AFFORDABLE BY 
DESIGN.
19:52:55 
RENTAL PROJECTS THAT HAVE A 
SUBDIVISION MAP ON
19:52:58  THEM AND CAN 
THEREFORE BE QURTED TO OWNERSHIP 
PROJECTS
19:53:01  WITHOUT CITY
19:53:04  PROOIVELZ, 
PAY THE
19:53:07  SAME FEE AS STACKED 
DPLATS AND WE'RE NOT PROPOSING
19:53:10  
TO CHANGE THAT IN THE ORDINANCE.
19:53:14 
NEXT SLIDE PLEASE.
THE SECOND MAJOR CHANGE THAT
19:53:17  WE 
ARE PROPOSING IS THE PERCENTAGE 
REQUIRED IF THE
19:53:20  DEVELOPER CHOOSE 
TO MEET THE
19:53:24  REQUIREMENT ENTIRELY 
BY BUILDING INCLUSION
19:53:27 ARY UNITS.
THE
19:53:32  RANGES RANGE FROM 18% TO 26%
19:53:35  
AS SHOWN ON THE SLIDE.
HOWEVER NO DEVELOPER LAST EVER 

19:53:38 CHOSEN THIS OPTION AND BASED ON 
THE FEEDBACK THAT WE'VE GOTTEN
19:53:41 , 
THAT'S BECAUSE OF THE PERCENTAGE
19:53:45  
REQUIRED RELATIVELY HIGH 
PERCENTAGE OF
19:53:49  INCLUSIONARY UNITS 
REQUIRED AS WELL AS THE 
REQUIREMENT THIS
19:53:52  THESE UNITS BE 
MADE AFFORDABLE TO EXTREMELY LOW
19:53:55  
INCOME HOUSEHOLDS WHO MAKE 30% 
OF LESS
19:53:58  OF THE MEDIAN INCOME AND 
VERY LOW INCOME BUYERS WHO EARN
19:54:01  
50% OR LESS OF MEDIAN INCOME.
19:54:05 
SO WE'RE PROPOSING TO REVISE THE 
REQUIREMENT TO
19:54:08  BE 15% 
INCLUSIONARY UNITS,
19:54:12  WITH 5% 
AFFORDABLE TO MODERATE INCOME 
BUYERS
19:54:15  AND 10% TO LOW INCOME 
BUYERS.

19:54:18 THAT 15% REQUIREMENT FOCUSED ON 
LOW AND MODERATE
19:54:22  INCOME BUYERS 
IS FAIRLY COMMON AMONG BAY AREA 
CITIES.
19:54:26 
SO THIS WOULD BETTER ALIGN US 
WITH OTHER CITIES.
19:54:29 
AND WOULD ALSO INCREASE THE 
LIKELIHOOD
19:54:33  THAT DEVELOPERRERS 
WOULD LIKELY PRODUCE SOME 
INCLUSIONARY
19:54:36  UNITS.
FOR RENTAL PROJECTS WE'RE 
PROPOSING A
19:54:40  10% INCLUSIONARY 
REQUIREMENT TARGETED AT LOW 
INCOME
19:54:43  RESIDENTS.
BECAUSE THE FEASIBILITY STUDY
19:54:46  
INDICATES ONLY A 5% LOW INCOME 
REQUIREMENT IS FEASIBLE
19:54:49  FOR 
RENTAL PROJECTS, STAFF BELIEVES
19:54:53  
THAT RENTAL DEVELOPERS WILL 
CHOOSE TO TAKE THE
19:54:56  PAY THE IN LIEU FEE IN 
THE SHORT TERM
19:55:00 .
HOWEVER IN THE MEDIUM OR LONG 
TERM
19:55:03  MARKET CONDITIONS CAN 
CHANGE AND INCLUSIONARY UNITS 
CAN BECOME
19:55:06  A REALISTIC OPTION 
FOR
19:55:09  RENTAL DEVELOPERS AND HAVING 
THE 10% IN PLACE WOULD
19:55:13  RESULT IN 
MORE NUMBER OF LOW INCOME
19:55:16  UNITS 
IN THAT SCENARIO.
THE FULL IN LIEU FEE AND
19:55:19  THE 
INCLUSIONARY OPTION CHANGES THAT 
I'VE
19:55:22  JUST DESCRIBED ARE THE TWO 
MAIN REVISIONS IN THE ORDINANCE
19:55:25 .
HOWEVER, PER COUNCIL DIRECTION 
WE'RE RETAINING
19:55:28  THE VARIOUS 
OTHER OPTIONS THAT ARE PROVIDED
19:55:32  
IN THE CURRENT ORDINANCE WITH A 
COUPLE OF PROPOSED CHANGES
19:55:35 .
SO NEXT SLIDE.

19:55:41 ONE OF THE OPTIONS IN THE 
ORDINANCE IS WHAT WE CALL THE 
HYBRID
19:55:44  OPTION.
THIS OPTION ALLOWS THE DEVELOPER 
TO BUILD MODERATE
19:55:48  INCOME 
INCLUSIONARY UNITS WHILE PAYING 
A FEE
19:55:52  IN LIEU OF BUILDING LOW 
INCOME INCLUSIONARY
19:55:55  UNITS.
SECOND COLUMN IN THE CHART SHOWS
19:55:58  
THE CURRENT COMBINATION
19:56:01  ONSITE 
AND IN LIEU FEE REQUIREMENT.
19:56:04 
UNDER THE PROPOSED OPTION, 
DEVELOPERS OF SINGLE
19:56:07  FAMILY 
HOMES OR TOWN HOMES EXERCISING 
THIS HYBRID
19:56:10  OPTION WOULD BE 
REQUIRED TO BUILD 5% MODERATE 
INCOME
19:56:14  UNITS ON SITE SO THAT'S A 
SLIGHT INCREASE FROM THE CURRENT
19:56:16  
ORDINANCE.
AND PAY IN LIEU FEES THAT WOULD 

19:56:19 BE PHASED IN, IN TWO STEPS.
ULTIMATELY TOPPING OUT
19:56:23  AT $29 
PER SQUARE FOOT.
19:56:26 
FOR STACKED FLATS, WE'RE 
PROPOSING ALSO
19:56:29  A 5% INCLUSIONARY 
REQUIREMENT,
19:56:33  FOR MODERATE 
INCOME, AND AN
19:56:36  IN LIEU FEE OF 
$12 PER SQUARE FOOT DURING THE
19:56:39  
LIFE OF THE ORDINANCE.
THE FEASIBILITY STUDY HAS 

19:56:42 CONCLUDED THAT A HIGHER FEE FOR 
STACKED FLATS IS IN
19:56:45 FEASIBLE.
THE FEE SAVINGS REALIZED BY
19:56:49  THIS 
EXERCISING THE HYBRID OPTION
19:56:52  
WORKS OUT TO O
19:56:56  $15 PER SQUARE FOOT 
BASED ON THE CITY'S
19:56:59  ECONOMIC 
CONSULTANT THAT $15 PER SQUARE 
FOOT IS
19:57:03  APPROXIMATELY EQUIVALENT 
TO TO PROVIDING THE 15% MODERATE
19:57:07  
INCOME UNITS.
NEXT SUPPLIED PLEASE
19:57:11 .
THERE IS ALSO AN OPTION IN THE 
CURRENT ORDINANCE THAT
19:57:14  ALLOWS A 
DEVELOPER OF FOR
19:57:17  SALE HOUSING TO 
FULFILL
19:57:20  THEIR OBLIGATION FOR FOR 
SALE UNITS BY PROVIDING
19:57:25  
AFFORDABLE UNITS.
THIS IS WHEN IT PROVIDES A
19:57:28  FOR 
SALE AND RENTAL UNIT.
IN THE CURRENT ORDINANCE
19:57:32  THE 
REQUIREMENT IS FOR 13.4% OF 
UNITS TO BE AFFORDABLE
19:57:35 .

19:57:38  AGAIN 
DIVIDED UP AMONG
19:57:42  FOUR DIFFERENT 
INCOME LEVELS, STAFF'S 
RECOMMENDATION IS
19:57:46  TO RAISE TO 
15% AND FOCUS ON LOW INCOME
19:57:49  AND 
VERY LOW INCOME UNITS.
WITH THAT I'LL TURN IT OVER
19:57:52  TO 
OUR HOUSING MANAGER, LUCIA 
HUGHES AND LUCIA
19:57:55  WILL WALK YOU 
THROUGH SOME OF THE OTHER 
PROPOSED CHANGES TO THE
19:57:59  
ORDINANCE.
DISCUSS THE INPUT
19:58:02  THAT WE GOT 
FROM STAKEHOLDERS, THE PLANNING 
COMMISSION'S
19:58:05  RECOMMENDATION AND 
THEN SUMMARIZE STAFF'S
19:58:07  
RECOMMENDATIONS BEFORE WE OPEN 
IT UP TO THE COUNCIL FOR 

19:58:11 QUESTIONS.
LUCIA.

19:58:22 
NEXT SLIDE, APPLIES.

WE WANT TO
19:58:31  TOUCH ON SOME 
CLARIFICATIONS AND MINOR
19:58:34  CHANGES 
PROPOSED BY STAFF AS A RESULT OF
19:58:38  
CHALLENGES AND LESSONS LEARNED 
FROM THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE
19:58:41  
CURRENT ORDINANCE.

19:58:44 CAN YOU GO BACK TO ONE SLIDE 
PLEASE
19:58:48  ALBERTO?
THE TIMING, THANK YOU
19:58:51 .
TIMING AND PERFORMANCE FOR 
PROJECTS THAT INCLUDE ON
19:58:54 SITE 
MARKET RATE AND AFFORDABLE 
UNITS, STAFF WANTS TO
19:58:57  CLARIFY 
THAT THE CONSTRUCTION TIMING AND 
OCCUPANCY OF THE
19:59:03  AFFORDABLE 
UNITS
19:59:06  SHOULD BE TIMING OF THE
19:59:09  
APPROVAL BODIES, DETERMINES THAT 
GREATER
19:59:13  PUBLIC BENEFITS WOULD 
RESULT FROM THE
19:59:16  MODIFICATION.
IN THIS CASE, THE
19:59:19  CITY MAY 
REQUIRE THAT THE COMPLETION
19:59:23  OF 
AFFORDABLE UNITS BE FURTHER 
SECURED BY THE APPLICANT
19:59:26  
AGREEMENT TO PAY THE IN-LIEU 
FEES.
19:59:29 
THIS WOULD ENSURE THAT THE 
PROJECT WILL
19:59:32  PAY THE IN-LIEU FEE 
OWED TO THE CITY
19:59:36  IN THE EVENT 
THERE ARE CHANGES OR PROBLEMS 
WITH THE DEVELOPMENTS
19:59:40 .
THE CITY'S AFFORDABLE HOUSING 
INTEREST WOULD BE PROTECTED
19:59:44 .
NEXT SLIDE PLEASE.
ANOTHER
19:59:48  CHANGE THAT STAFF WANTS 
TO MAKE IS TO FURTHER CLARIFY
19:59:51  
THE REQUIREMENTS, IF AN 
APPLICANT DESIRES TO MODIFY
19:59:55  THE 
AFFORDABLE HOUSING PLAN AFTER
19:59:58  
PROJECT APPROVAL.
AN APPLICATION FOR THE FIRST 

20:00:01 APPROVAL OF A RESIDENTIAL 
PROJECT INCLUDES AN
20:00:05  AFFORDABLE 
HOUSING PLAN, DESCRIBING HOW THE 
PROJECT WILL
20:00:08  COMPLY WITH THE 
AFFORDABLE HOUSING ORDINANCE.

20:00:11 BECAUSE THE ORIGINAL AFFORDABLE 
HOUSING PLAN MAY
20:00:15  HAVE INFLUENCED 
THE APPROVAL BODY'S
20:00:18  DECISION ON 
APPROVING THE PROJECT, STAFF IS
20:00:21  
PROPOSING THAT MODIFICATIONS TO 
THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING
20:00:25  PLAN, 
AFTER PROJECT APPROVAL, WOULD 
NEED TO BE
20:00:28  REVIEWED BY THE 
APPROVAL BODY.

20:00:32 ANY PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO THE 
AFFORDABLE HOUSING PLAN MUST BE 
APPROVED ABOUT
20:00:35  WHICH THE 
APPROVAL BODY PRIOR TO BUILDING 
PERMIT ISSUANCE
20:00:38 .
NEXT SLIDE PLEASE.

20:00:46 THIS CONCLUDES THE PROPOSED 
REVISIONS SECTION OF THE 
PRESENTATION
20:00:50 .
WE BELIEVE THESE PROPOSED 
REVISIONS WOULD HELP THE
20:00:53  CITY 
ACHIEVE THE GOAL OF PROMOTING 
HOUSING
20:00:57  OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL 
ECONOMIC SEGMENTS OF
20:01:00  OUR 
COMMUNITY WITHOUT SUPPRESSING 
THE CONSTRUCTION
20:01:03  OF MARKET RATE 
HOUSING.
A MORE DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF
20:01:06  
ALL OF THE PROPOSED CHANGES TO 
THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING
20:01:10  ORDINANCE 
IS INCLUDED IN YOUR AGENDA 
PACKET
20:01:13 .
NEXT SLIDE, PLEASE.

20:01:17 WE'D LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOU 
PUBLIC COMMENTS WE
20:01:20  RECEIVED 
DURING THE ORDINANCE REVISION

20:01:31  AND CITY COUNCIL.
STAKEHOLDERS
20:01:34  INPUT IS SUMMARIZED 
ON THE SLIDE.
IN A
20:01:37  NUTSHELL, MARKET RATE 
DEVELOPERS WANT THE CITY

RETAIN THE FEE OPTION, KEEP
20:01:44  ALL 
OF THE ALTERNATIVES, MINIMIZE 
FEE LEVELS
20:01:48 , PHASE IN OF FEE 
INCREASES, AND
20:01:51  LOWER THE 
INCLUSIONARY REQUIREMENTS
20:01:54 .
AFFORDABLE HOUSING ADVOCATES 
WANT THE CITY TO
20:01:57  INCREASE THE 
FEES TO THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT 
FEASIBLE
20:02:02 .
ONE COMMUNITY MEMBER WANTS
20:02:05  
INCLUSIONARY REQUIREMENTS FOR 
FOR SALE MODERATE INCOME
20:02:09  UNITS 
WITH NO IN-LIEU FEE OPTIONS.

20:02:12 NEXT SLIDE PLEASE.

STAKEHOLDER INPUT TO THE 
PLANNING COMMISSION AT ITS

AUGUST 26th MEETING.
NO PUBLIC COMMENTS WERE
20:02:34  MADE ON 
THIS ITEM.
THE
20:02:38  PLANNING COMMISSION 
UNANIMOUSLY VOTED TO RECOMMEND 
COUNCIL APPROVAL
20:02:41  OF THE 
RECOMMENDATIONS PROPOSED BY 
STAFF
20:02:44  WITH ONE MODIFICATION THAT 
WOULD SET THE
20:02:48  MAXIMUM FEE FOR 
FOR-SALE TOWN HOUSE AND
20:02:51  
SINGLE-FAMILY DEVELOPMENTS AT 
$50 PER SQUARE
20:02:54  FOOT RATHER THAN 
THE $44 PER SQUARE FOOT 
RECOMMENDED
20:02:57  BY STAFF.

20:03:00 STAFF CONTINUES TO RECOMMEND TO 
COUNCIL THAT THE MAXIMUM FEE BE
20:03:03  
SET AT $44 PER SQUARE FOOT FOR 
BOTH TOWN
20:03:07  HOME AND SINGLE FAMILY 
PROJECTS.
ALTHOUGH
20:03:10  THE FEASIBILITY STUDY 
DETERMINED THAT A $50
20:03:13  PER SQUARE 
FOOT FEE IS FEASIBLE FOR TOWN
20:03:16  
HOME PROJECTS, MAXIMUM PER-
20:03:19 
PER-SQUARE-FOOT FEE THAT SINGLE
20:03:21  
FAMILY PROJECTS CAN ABSORB IS 
$44.

20:03:25 ALSO, BY KEEPING THE FEE AT $44 
PER SQUARE
20:03:28  FOOT FOR BOTH SINGLE 
FAMILY HOME AND TOWN
20:03:32  HOME 
DEVELOPMENT, FREMONT'S MAXIMUM
20:03:35  
FEE LEVEL WILL BE CLOSER TO THE 
MAXIMUM FEE LEVEL OF
20:03:38  OTHER BAY 
AREA CITIES.
NEXT SLIDE PLEASE.

FIND THAT THE
20:03:57  PROPOSED ZONING 
TEXT AMENDMENT IS CONSISTENT
20:04:00  
WITH THE GENERAL PLAN.

AMENDMENT FURTHERS THE PUBLIC 
INTEREST,
20:04:06  CONVENIENCE AND 
GENERAL WELFARE OF THE CITY
20:04:10 .

NEXT SLIDE PLEASE.
THIS CONCLUDES
20:05:06  OUR PRESENTATION.
WITH THAT WE'LL OPEN IT UP FOR
20:05:07  
QUESTIONS.
THANK YOU.

20:05:12 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.
I'D LIKE TO TURN THIS BACK TO 
THE COUNCIL
20:05:17  FOR CLARIFYING 
QUESTIONS.

20:05:23 SO COUNCILMEMBERS, ARE THERE ANY 
CLARIFYING QUESTIONS?
20:05:26 
WE'LL BEGIN WITH COUNCILMEMBER 
KASSAN.
20:05:29 
>> Councilmember Kassan:   YES, 
I WAS WONDERING WHETHER YOU
20:05:32  KNOW 
WHY PLANNING COMMISSION 
RECOMMENDED RAISING
20:05:36  THE FEE, TO 
THE SAME AMOUNT FOR
20:05:40  BOTH TOWN 
HOMES AND SINGLE FAMILY PROJECTS
20:05:44 
PROJECTS, INSTEAD OF JUST 
RAISING THE FEE TO $50
20:05:47  PER 
SQUARE FOOT FOR TOWN HOMES
20:05:51 ?
20:05:58 
>> Mayor Mei:   STAFF, IS THERE 
ANY ANSWERS
20:06:01  TO THE QUESTION?

20:06:09 >> THE PLANNING COMMISSION 
WANTED THE SAME FEE FOR TOWN 
HOMES
20:06:12  AND SINGLE FAMILY HOME 
BECAUSE THEY FEEL
20:06:16  THAT MORE FEES 
WILL HELP THE DEVELOPMENT WITH 
MORE
20:06:21  AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN A 
SHORTER TIME PERIOD.
BUT
20:06:24  STAFF DID ADVISE THE 
PLANNING COMMISSION THAT $50
20:06:27  PER 
SQUARE FOOT FEE IS NOT FEASIBLE 
FOR SINGLE
20:06:30  FAMILY HOMES.
BUT THEY JUST -- THEY STILL WENT 
AHEAD
20:06:33  WITH THEIR RECOMMENDATION 
OF $50 PER SQUARE FOOT FEE
20:06:37  FOR 
BOTH FRO TOE TYPES
20:06:39 .
>> Councilmember Kassan:   AND 
IF WE WERE TO VOTE TONIGHT TO 

20:06:43 RECOMMEND THE $50 PER SQUARE 
FOOT
20:06:46  FEE JUST FOR TOWN HOMES BUT 
KEEP THE $44
20:06:49  FOR THE SINGLE 
FAMILY, IS THAT -- IS THERE
20:06:52  ANY 
PROBLEM WITH THAT?
>> THERE IS
20:06:55  NOT A PROBLEM WITH 
THAT.
>> Councilmember Kassan:   OKAY, 

20:06:59 THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei:   OKAY.
ANY OTHER
20:07:03  CLARIFYING QUESTIONS 
AT THIS TIME FROM THE COUNCIL?

20:07:06 SEEING NONE I'LL TURN IT OVER TO -- I'LL
20:07:09  OPEN UP THE PUBLIC 
COMMENT PERIOD.
AND I SEE
20:07:12  WE HAVE A SPEAKER 
ENDING IN 3
20:07:15 65.

20:07:19 WELCOME.

20:07:28 >> THIS IS ALICE CAF
20:07:31  CAVE
20:07:35 ETTE.
WE HAVE TWO SPEAKERS ON THIS 
TELEPHONE
20:07:38  NUMBER.
I'LL GO FIRST.
THE
20:07:41  BASIC FOR SALE AFFORDABLE 
HOUSING IMPACT OBLIGATION
20:07:45  IS 
INCLUSIONARY ONLY.
I ASK THAT
20:07:48  YOU REMOVE THE THE IN 
LIEU ALTERNATIVE
20:07:51  IN 
LIEU ALTERNATIVE
20:07:55  FOR THAT 
SECTION OF OBLIGATION ONLY.
THAT IS THE ONLY WAY WE WILL GET
20:07:58  
THE BMR'S REQUIRED
20:08:02  BY
20:08:07  RHNA, 
INCREASING IN LIEU FEES WILL NOT
20:08:10  
GET DEVELOPERS TO SELECT THE 
INCLUSIVE OPTION.
20:08:14 
AT THE COUNCIL WORK SESSION 
COUNCILMEMBER KENG REMARKED THAT
20:08:17  
IT IS MORE COSTLY AND HARDER TO 
GET SOMEONE OUT OF HOME
20:08:20 LESSNESS 
THAN TO PREVENT THEIR 
HOMELESSNESS IN THE
20:08:23  FIRST PLACE.
20:08:26 
LAST WORK
20:08:29  SESSION PRESENTATION 
SHOWED THAT AFFORDABLE
20:08:33  
INCLUSIONARY UNITS ARE PRODUCED 
MORE QUICKLY THAN
20:08:36  THOSE FINANCED 
WITH IN-LIEU FEES.
PLEASE REMOVE
20:08:39  THE IN-LIEU 
ALTERNATIVE FOR THE FOR SALE 
MODERATE
20:08:43  OR LOW INCOME IMPACT 
OBLIGATIONS, UNDER
20:08:47  18155080
20:08:50 A.
PLANNING COMMISSIONER MCDONALD 
BROUGHT UP
20:08:53  ANOTHER POINT.
CURRENTLY, THE IN LIEU
20:08:56  FEES 
COLLECTED FOR THE MODERATE OR 
LOW
20:09:00  INCOME IMPACT OBLIGATIONS 
ARE NOT BEING USED
20:09:03  FOR THOSE ARE 
MODERATE INCOME.
FREMONT
20:09:06  DOESN'T HELP ITS 
TEACHERS, HEALTH CARE WORKERS OR
20:09:09  
SERVICE PROVIDERS, MAKING 
BETWEEN 89
20:09:13 ,000 AND $120,000,
20:09:15  
AFFORD TO LIVE IN FREMONT.
THANK YOU.

20:09:18 AND NOW I HAVE CHRIS.
IF YOU COULD RESET THE TIMER
20:09:21 .
IS
20:09:27 .
>> GOOD EVENING, THIS IS CHRIS 
CAIIVET.

20:09:30  
CAIVETD.
YOU ARE
20:09:33  BEING ASKED TO MAKE A 
DECISION THAT WILL EFFECT SOME 
OF THE
20:09:36  LAST BUILTABLE LAND IN 
FREMONT .
I THINK THIS IS
20:09:39  TIME TO SEND A 
CLEAR MESSAGE TO DEVELOPERS THAT 
ALL
20:09:42  FUTURE FOR-SALE RESIDENTIAL 
DWROMENTS MUST
20:09:46  
DEVELOPMENTS MUST INCLUDE A 
SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT
20:09:49  OF ONSITE 
AFFORDABLE HOUSING TO MEET THE 
MODERATE AND
20:09:52  LOW INCOME IMPACT 
OBLIGATIONS WITH NO IN
20:09:55 -LIEU FEE 
ALTERNATIVE.

20:09:58 THAT INCLUDES CAN
20:10:02  SINGLE FAMILY 
MULTIFAMILY
20:10:05  MIXED USE TOWN 
CENTER AND ANY OTHER 
DEVELOPMENTS THAT
20:10:08  HAVE FOR SALE 
HOUSING UNITS.
IF WE DO
20:10:11  NOT REQUIRE THE 
INCLUSION OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING 
FOR THE MODERATE AND LOW
20:10:14  LEVELS 
NOW, WE WILL NEVER GET IT.
INCREASING
20:10:17  THE IN-LIEU FEES WILL 
NOT ACHIEVE
20:10:20  DID IS DESIRED 
RESULT.
WE ARE RUNNING OUT OF
20:10:23  LAND AND 
WE ARE RUNNING OUT OF TIME.
WE NEED
20:10:27  TO REQUIRE INCLUSIONARY 
HOUSING
20:10:30  NOW.
THANK YOU.

20:10:35 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.
AND NEXT SPEAKER IS DENNIS
20:10:38  
MARTIN.
FTC WELCOME.

20:10:42 WELCOME.

20:10:46 >> THANK YOU, MAYOR AND COUNCIL.
DENNIS MARTIN SPEAKING ON
20:10:49  BEHALF 
OF BIA BAY AREA.
AND
20:10:53  FIRST OF ALL I WANTED TO 
EXPRESS OUR
20:10:56  APPRECIATION TO 
STAFF AND THE CITY
20:10:59  FOR THEIR 
OUTREACH EFFORTS ON THIS ISSUE
20:11:02 .
THEY'VE BEEN EXEMPLARY
20:11:07  AND WE 
WISH EVERY CITY WAS AN
20:11:11  
CONSCIENTIOUS AS FREMONT IS 
ABOUT MAKING SURE THEY CHECK IN
20:11:14  
WITH STAKEHOLDERS ON THESE 
IMPORTANT ISSUES.
20:11:17 
BY AND LARGE BIA DOES CONCUR
20:11:20  
WITH STAFF RECOMMENDATIONS.
YOU'LL NEVER HEAR BI
20:11:24 A ENDORSE A 
FEE INCREASE OF THIS NATURE.
20:11:27 
ESPECIALLY ON FOR-SALE HOMES 
BECAUSE FOR-
20:11:30 SALE HOMES ARE WHAT 
IS THE BACKBONE OF THE COMMUNITY
20:11:33 
COMMUNITY.
AND THAT WE HOPE THE CITY 

20:11:36 COUNCIL UNDERSTANDS THAT 
PROVIDING HOME OWNERSHIP
20:11:40  IN THE 
COMMUNITY IS A VERY, VERY 
IMPORTANT
20:11:43  ISSUE.
WE WOULD LIKE
20:11:46  TO DRAW THE CITY 
COUNCIL'S ATTENTION
20:11:49  TO THE 
LETTER THAT WE HAVE SUBMITTED ON 
TONIGHT'S
20:11:53  ITEM.
AND ONE PARTICULAR ITEM WHICH
20:11:56  IS 
THE FEE THE DEFERRAL ISSUE.
20:11:59 
TWO YEARS AGO, THE CITY COUNCIL 
DECIDED TO
20:12:03  O
20:12:06  TO ELIMINATE FEE 
DEFERRAL ON MARKET
20:12:09  RATE UNITS.
AND THAT REPRESENTS A 
SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN
20:12:13  COSTS TO 
THE DEVELOPMENT OF RESIDENTIAL
20:12:15  
UNITS.
AND WE THINK THAT THE COUNCIL 

20:12:18 NEEDS TO REVISIT THAT.
AND WITH THIS
20:12:23  ORDINANCE UPDATE 
IT IS A PERFECT OPPORTUNITY TO 
DO THAT
20:12:27 .
YOU'VE ALREADY DECIDED TO 
PROVIDE
20:12:30  SOME EXEMPTIONS FOR 
AFFORDABLE UNITS.
WE THINK YOU
20:12:33  SHOULD GO A LITTLE 
BIT FURTHERS AND REVISIT THAT 
POLICY AND
20:12:36  ALLOW MARKET RATE 
UNITS CAN TO PAY
20:12:39  TO PAY FEES AT
20:12:43  CERTIFICATE 
OF OCCUPANCY.
SO WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME
20:12:46 .
AND GOOD NIGHT
20:12:49 .
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.
20:12:54 
AND AT THIS TIME I WILL CLOSE 
THE PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD.

20:12:58 NO, WAIT, SA
20:13:02 LIM MESTAN.

20:13:09 >> HOLM, MAYOR, CAN YOU HEAR ME?
HELLO
20:13:12 , HELLO.
HELLO
20:13:15 .
>> The Clerk:   YES, WE CAN 
LAYER YOU, PLEASE PROCEED.

20:13:18 >> YES, HI, CONGRATULATIONS FOR 
TRYING TO DO SOMETHING
20:13:21  GOOD THAT 
IS NEEDED AND REQUIRED
20:13:25 .
AND THE ISSUE
20:13:29  OF CAN WE WORK 
WITH THE HOMELESS PEOPLE
20:13:32  AND WE 
UNDERSTAND HOW A PERSON FROM 
HAVING A HOME TO
20:13:35  NO HOME TO 
BECOMING HOMELESS, IT'S A
20:13:38  SERIES 
OF STEPS THAT HAPPENS, THAT
20:13:42  MAKE 
PEOPLE EITHER HOMELESS OR MOVE
20:13:45  
OUT OF THE STATE.

20:13:48 I HAVE ONE QUESTION VERY SIMPLE, 
THAT THERE ARE
20:13:51  MANY, MANY 
COMMUNITIES AND MANY CHURCHES 
WHO ARE WORKING
20:13:55  TO BUILD HOMES
20:13:58  
FOR THEIR COMMUNITY.
AND WE ARE ALSO WORKING
20:14:02  TO MAKE
20:14:05  
A UNIT COMMUNITY BASED HOME.
IS IT POSSIBLE THAT IF
20:14:09  WE WANT 
TO BUILD THE HOMES AND
20:14:12  AWARD 
THIS TO THE COMMUNITY,
20:14:15  OR THE 
COMMUNITIES THAT WE BELONG TO, 
THAT
20:14:18  WAY, WE WOULD NEED
20:14:21  LESS 
CITY FUNDING
20:14:25  ENROLLMENT FUNDING, 
FUND THE PROJECTS
20:14:28  AND AWARDED 
THROUGHOUT PEOPLE
20:14:32  WHO ARE
20:14:37  
APPLYING FOR THESE 
BELOW-MARKET-RATE HOMES
20:14:40 .
THAT IS A QUESTION THAT I HAVE.
THANK YOU, BECKLENBERG.

20:14:45 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.
AND WE'LL NOW CLOSE
20:14:48  THE PUBLIC 
COMMENT PERIOD.
20:14:52  AND BRING IT BACK 
TO THE COUNCIL
20:14:55  FOR CONVERSATION 
AND DISCUSSION.
COULD WE PLEASE BRING UP
20:14:58  THE 
RECOMMENDATIONS THIS EVENING FOR 
THE STAFF RECOMMENDATIONS?

20:15:05 THANK YOU.
AND SO AT THIS TIME, I'LL TURN 
IT BACK TO
20:15:08  OUR COUNCIL FOR 
CONVERSATION AND DISCUSSIONS
20:15:12 .
20:15:16 
VICE MAYOR SHAO.
>> Councilmember Shao:   THANK 

20:15:20 YOU, MAYOR MEI.
I'M GLAD THAT THE
20:15:23  STAFF, THROUGH 
THE NEXUS ANALYSIS
20:15:27 , DID FIND 
SOME DATA.
I'M
20:15:30  JUST CONCERNED THAT WHILE 
WE'RE INCREASING THE FEE LEVEL
20:15:33  
FOR FOR SALE PROJECTS, WE ARE 
REDUCING THE PERCENTAGE
20:15:38  FOR THE 
INCLUSIONARY REQUIREMENT FOR
20:15:42  THE 
FOR SALE PROJECTS FROM OVER, YOU 
KNOW, YOU
20:15:45  21% ALL THE
20:15:48  21% TO
20:15:52  DOWN LIKE 15%.
IT IS TYPICAL BARGAIN
20:15:55 ING 
STRATEGY, YOU WIN SOME, YOU LOSE 
SOME.
20:15:58 
I WONDER WHETHER THAT WOULD HELP 
WITH THE CITY COUNCIL
20:16:03  CITY COUNCIL'S RESOLVE 
TO
20:16:06  ENCOURAGE DEVELOPERS TO BUILD 
MORE
20:16:09  AFFORDABLE HOUSING.
20:16:13 
I WOULD LIKE TO KEEP
20:16:17  THE 
INCLUSIONARY
20:16:21  REQUIREMENT CLOSER 
TO THE ORIGINAL
20:16:24  PERCENTAGE, IF 
POSSIBLE
20:16:28 .
IS THERE
20:16:31  ANY STRONG REASON FOR 
SUCH A REDUCTION
20:16:35 , STAFF PLEASE?
20:16:43 
>> SO THE STATE SAYS THAT ANY 
INCLUSIONARY
20:16:46  REQUIREMENT OVER 
AND ABOVE 15%
20:16:50  MUST MEET STATE 
REVIEW.

20:16:54 BECAUSE STATE IS SAYING THAT
20:16:57  AT 
OR 15% OR LOWER GENERALLY IT 
DOES
20:17:00  NOT SUPPRESS THE 
DEVELOPMENT OF MARKET
20:17:04  RATE 
HOUSING.
BUT HIGHER THAN 15
20:17:07 % GENERALLY 
WILL REQUIRE
20:17:11  A STATE REVIEW ON 
THIS ONE.
SO THAT'S WHY WE WANT TO KEEP
20:17:14  IT 
AT 15%, THAT'S ONE REASON.
AND ALSO,
20:17:18  OUR FEASIBILITY STUDY 
SHOWS THAT
20:17:22  THE -- IT'S FEASIBLE 
TO REQUIRE A
20:17:25  TEN TO 20%.
AND SO THAT'S WHY
20:17:28  STAFF WANTS TO 
STAY AT THIS 15%.
TO
20:17:32  SEE
20:17:35  HOW MUCH WE CAN GET 
HOUSING BUILT.
AND ALSO WE TRY
20:17:39  THE 21% BEFORE, 
DURING THIS ORDINANCE, THE 18%
20:17:42  
TO 21.6%.
WE DID NOT GET
20:17:46  ANY INCLUSIONARY 
HOUSING USING THESE PERCENTAGES.
BECAUSE
20:17:49  THE DEVELOPERS ARE 
SAYING THAT IT SUPPRESSES
20:17:52  THE 
PRODUCTION OF ONSITE UNITS.
SO THAT'S WHY
20:17:56  STAFF LANDS ON 
15%. 
AS
20:18:00  THE RECOMMENDATION.
20:18:02 
>> Dan Schoenholz:   AND IF I 
CAN JUST CLARIFY.

20:18:05 WE HAVE AN EXISTING
20:18:08  REQUIREMENT 
OF 18 TO 21.6%
20:18:12 .
WE WOULDN'T ACTUALLY NEED -- THE 
STATE WOULDN'T
20:18:15  HAVE ANY ABILITY 
TO REVIEW THAT.
BECAUSE IT'S ALREADY
20:18:18  IN OUR 
ORDINANCE ARE.
SO IF COUNCIL WANTED TO
20:18:24 .
SO IF COUNCIL WANTED TO KEEP THE 
18 TO 21
20:18:27 .6% INCLUSIONARY 
REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE
20:18:31  THERE YOU 
COULD, AND IT WOULDN'T SUBJECT 
US TO
20:18:34  STATE REVIEW.
AS MENTION ID, THE STATE
20:18:38  IS 
SIGNALING THAT 15% IS IF LEVEL 
THAT
20:18:42  IS KIND OF STANDARD AND 
ANYTHING ABOVE THAT IS SOMETHING 
THEY WANT TO
20:18:45  LOOK AT.
BUT BECAUSE WE ALREADY HAVE IT 
IN OUR ORDINANCE
20:18:48  WE WOULDN'T BE 
SUBJECT TO STATE
20:18:51  REVIEW.
AND
20:18:54 , YOU KNOW, SO OIT IS AN 
OPTION.
BUT AS ALUCIA
20:18:58  AS LUCE QULA
20:19:05  LUCIA SEDATE
20:19:09 ED, 21% IS 
RECOMMENDED AS
20:19:12  FEASIBLE AND 
WE'RE RECOMMENDING 10%
20:19:15  LOW 
INCOME AND NATURALLY IF YOU HAVE 
SOME LOW INCOME UNITS
20:19:18  MIXED IN 
THERE, IT'S LESS FEASIBLE
20:19:21  
BECAUSE THE DEVELOPER HAS TO 
SUBSIDIZE
20:19:24  THE UNITS MORE.
SO WE DIDN'T SPECIFICALLY HAVE
20:19:28  
THE CONSULTANT STUDY WHAT A MIX
20:19:31  
OF MODERATE AND LOW WOULD BE 
FEASIBLE
20:19:34 .
BUT IT WOULD BE SOMETHING LESS 
THAN 20%
20:19:39 .
20:19:44 
>> Councilmember Shao:   OKAY SO 
IF LET'S JUST SAY KEEP IT 20
20:19:47 % 
OVERALL WITH 10% MODERATE, 10
20:19:50 % 
LOW, THAT WOULD STILL FALL INTO 
THE BRACKET
20:19:53  THAT THE STATE WOULD 
ORECOMMEND
20:19:56 , OR ALLOW, AND ALSO, 
THE
20:19:59  FEERVEL STUDY WOULDss
20:20:06  FEASIBILITY STUDY WOULD
20:20:09  
RECOMMEND, IS THAT CORRECT?
>> Dan Schoenholz:   THAT'S 

20:20:13 CORRECT.
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU NEXT
20:20:16  
CLARIFYING QUESTIONS OR 
COMMENTS.

20:20:19 COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN.
>> Councilmember Salwan:   THANK 
YOU MAYOR AND THANK YOU
20:20:22  STAFF 
FOR THIS PRESENTATION.
I WAS KIND OF SURPRISED ORIGINAL
20:20:25 
ORIGINALLY BECAUSE I WOULD THINK 
THAT MORE COUNCILMEMBERS WOULD 

20:20:28 WANT TO HAVE MORE PROJECTS BUILT 
ONSITE AS
20:20:31  INCLUSIONARY HOUSING.
BUT WHEN WITH EVOTED LAST TIME 
MOST WANTED
20:20:35  THE IN LIEU FEES SO 
THAT WE COULD GET MORE SUBSIDY
20:20:38  
AND HAVE LARGER PROJECTS.
SO THAT WE
20:20:41  COULD HELP MORE FOLKS 
WITH EXTREMELY LOW AND
20:20:44  VERY LOW 
INCOME.
ONE OF THE AREAS THAT WE ARE
20:20:47  
STILL STRUGGLING WITH IS THE 
MIDDLE HOUSING.
20:20:50 
AND I STILL THINK WE HAVE ZERO, 
RIGHT?

20:20:53 WE NEVER HIT THOSE GOALS.
HOW DO WE INCENTIVIZE
20:20:56  THOSE IN 
SOME OF THESE FEES
20:20:59 ?
>> Dan Schoenholz:   RIGHT
20:21:03 .
YOU KNOW WHETHER YOU SAY MIDDLE, 
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN,
20:21:06  ARE YOU 
TALKING ABOUT MODERATE INCOME
20:21:09 ?
>> Councilmember Salwan:   
MODERATE INCOME.

20:21:12 YES.
>> Dan Schoenholz:   ZOO 
MODERATE
20:21:15  INCOME HOUSING IS A 
DIFFICULTY SEGMENT FOR US
20:21:18  TO GET 
BUILT.
YOU KNOW THE SPEAKERS TALKED
20:21:21  SPEAKERS TALKED 
ABOUT MANDATE
20:21:24 ING MODERATE INCOME 
INCLUSIONARY UNITS AND THAT
20:21:27  
WOULD BE ONE WAY TO GET THEM 
BUILT.

20:21:30 BUT OBVIOUSLY THE TRADEOFF WOULD 
BE THAT THE FEES COLLECT
20:21:34 ED WOULD 
BE MUCH LOWER.
SO IT'S REALLY KIND OF A IT'S A 

20:21:37 TRADEOFF, WHERE DO YOU WANT THE 
RESOURCES THAT ARE COMING FROM 
MARKET RATE
20:21:40  DEVELOPMENT TO BE 
TARGETED?
NOR MODERATE
20:21:44 FOR MODERATE INCOME HOUSING
20:21:48  ONE 
OF THE CHALLENGES IS THAT YOU 
DON'T GET STATE AND
20:21:51  FEDERAL 
CONTRIBUTIONS.
YOU DON'T LEVERAGE IN ANY 

20:21:54 OUTSIDE DOLLARS, IN THE WAY THAT 
YOU DO WHEN YOU COLLECT
20:21:58  FEES, 
AND THEN YOU USE THOSE TO
20:22:02  
CONSTRUCT AFFORDABLE MULTIFAMILY
20:22:05  
RENTAL PROJECTS.
AND SO THERE IS AN ADVANTAGE
20:22:08 , 
AND I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE 
REASONS THAT THE COUNCIL WAS 

20:22:11 VERY INTERESTED IN CONTINUING TO 
COLLECT IN LIEU FEES.
20:22:14 
YOU CAN USE THOSE IN LIEU FEES
20:22:18  
TO ATTRACT OUTSIDE FUNDING TO 
KIND OF EXPAND THE PIE
20:22:21  THAT'S 
USED FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING.
20:22:26 
SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE 
TRADEOFFS, OBVIOUSLY
20:22:29  WE WOULD 
LOVE TO BE ABLE TO DO A LOT OF 
BOTH BUT
20:22:33  IT IS REALLY KIND OF A 
ZERO SUM GAME.
THERE IS ONLY
20:22:36  SO MUCH SUBSIDY 
AVAILABLE.
20:22:37 
>> Councilmember Salwan:   
THANKS FOR EXPANDING ON THE 

20:22:41 LEVERAGING ASPECT OF IT.
REGARDING VICE MAYOR SHAO
20:22:44 'S 
CONCERN ABOUT THE INCLUSIONARY
20:22:47 , 
THE PERCENTAGES.
SO ARE WE GET
20:22:50 TING ANY PROJECTS 
BUILT AT THE CURRENT STATE, DO 
YOU
20:22:53  THINK IF WE WERE LOWER WE 
WOULD GET MORE BUILT,
20:22:56  OR WHAT'S 
THE STATUS?
>> Dan Schoenholz:   YES,
20:23:00  I MEAN 
AS I MENTIONED WE HAVEN'T HAD A
20:23:03  
SINGLE PROJECT BUILT IN THE LAST 
SIX YEARS WHERE
20:23:07  A DEVELOPER 
PROVIDED, YOU KNOW, EITHER THE 
18%
20:23:10  OR THE 21.6
20:23:13 % UNITS
20:23:16 , 
INCLUSIONARY UNITS.
BUT YOU KNOW THAT MAY BE OKAY IF 

20:23:19 WHAT YOU REALLY WANT TO DO IS 
DRIVER THE DEVELOPER
20:23:23  TOWARDS 
PAYING IN-LIEU FEES, THEN
20:23:26  
KEEPING IT ATE A HIGH LEVEL IS 
ONE WAY TO DO
20:23:29  THAT.
I THINK WE -- ALTHOUGH IT WASN'T
20:23:32  
CLEAR FROM THE COUNCIL WORK 
SESSION, I THINK WE DID --
20:23:36  WE 
THOUGHT WE HEARD AN INTEREST IN 
TRYING
20:23:39  TO INCENTIVIZE A
20:23:42  BIT OF 
MODERATE INCOME INCLUSIONARY
20:23:45  
HOUSING WITHOUT REQUIRING IT, 
SEEING IF WE
20:23:49  COULD TWEAK THE 
ORDINANCE
20:23:52  IN THE WAY THERE WAS 
SOME PRODUCTION.
20:23:55 
THAT IS ONE OF OUR REASONING FOR 
REQUIRING THE 15% REQUIREMENT.
20:24:00 
THE OTHER WAS FRANKLY TO BE SORT 
OF A
20:24:06  ALIGNED WITH OTHER DISAND 
MAKE IT SORT OF SIMPLER.
20:24:09 
OUR ORDINANCE LAST TIME AROUND 
WAS KIND OF
20:24:12  COMPLEX AND THAT WAS 
BECAUSE OF THE LEGAL ENVIRONMENT 
THAT EXIST
20:24:16 ED AT THE TIME.
SO WE WERE THINKING THAT WE 
COULD ACCOMPLISH SEVERAL
20:24:19  HE 
OBJECTIVES AT ONCE BY CHANGING
20:24:22  
THE INCLUSIONARY REQUIREMENT.
BUT CERTAINLY THE COUNCIL COULD 

20:24:25 LEAVE IT WHERE IT IS AND THAT 
WOULD TEND
20:24:29  TO, I THINK, RESULT 
IN DEVELOPERS
20:24:33  ALMOST UNANIMOUSLY 
EITHER PAYING THE ENTIRE
20:24:36  FEE OR 
POTENTIALLY DOING THAT HYBRID 
OPTION.

20:24:39 THAT'S THE OTHER PIECE.
IS THEY COULD CHOOSE TO
20:24:43  BUILD 
THEIR MODERATE INCOME 
REQUIREMENT AND THEN PAY A 

20:24:46 PARTIAL FEE.
20:24:47 
SO --
>> Councilmember Salwan:   

20:24:50 THAT'S AN INTERESTING POINT YOU 
JUST MADE THERE, THAT IF WE WERE
20:24:54  
TO INCREASE THE
20:24:58  INCLUSIONARY 
NEARNLG WOULD IN FACT DRIVE THEM 
TO PAY IN-
20:25:01 LIEU FEES SO YOU 
WOULDN'T GET
20:25:04  VERY MUCH 
INCLUSIONARY HOUSING AT ALL.
THAT'S
20:25:07  THE INCENTIVES AND THE 
DISINCENTIVES, GOOD DISCUSSION.
REGARDING THE
20:25:10  REST OF THE ITEMS, 
I THINK I'M OKAY WITH WHAT STAFF 
IS
20:25:13  PROPOSING.
I THINK 44 IS FINE.
I THINK THAT'S PRETTY HIGH
20:25:16 .
WE ALWAYS GET CRITICIZE THEY'D 
WE HAVE DID
20:25:19  HIGHEST FEES.
I THINK IF 44 IS AMONG THE
20:25:22  
HIGHEST I THINK WE'RE GOOD.
WE DON'T NEED TO --
20:25:25  I DON'T SEE 
ANY REASON TO GO ABOVE THAT IF 
WE ARE ALREADY
20:25:29  AT THE MAXIMUM 
FEES.
BECAUSE A LOT
20:25:32  OF FEES ADD TO THE 
COST OF HOUSING WHICH CAUSES
20:25:35  
MORE EXPENSIVE HOUSING FOR THE 
REST OF THE FOLKS.

20:25:38 SO I'M OKAY WITH STAFF 
RECOMMENDATION.
I'M OPEN TO
20:25:42  FEEDBACK FROM VICE 
MAYOR SHAO AND OUR COLLEAGUES 
ABOUT
20:25:45  THE PERCENTAGE FOR
20:25:47  
INCLUSIONARY PERCENTAGES.
THANK YOU.

20:25:50 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.
20:25:54 
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN.
>> Councilmember Kassan:   YES
20:25:57 , 
IT IS THE DEFINITELY A 
CONUNDRUM.

20:26:00 BECAUSE IF WE, YOU KNOW, IF WE 
REQUIRE TOO HIGH
20:26:03  OF 
INCLUSIONARY, THEN IT BASICALLY 
MEANS WE DON'T GET ANY
20:26:07 .
SO THAT IT IS TOUGH.
AND I FEEL LIKE THE NUMBERS
20:26:10  THAT 
THE STAFF CAME UP WITH,
20:26:12  IT IS 
DISAPPOINTING TO SEE THEM GOING 
DOWN.

20:26:15 BUT I DO THINK THAT, YOU KNOW, 
IRONICALLY IT WILL
20:26:18  PROBABLY LEAD 
TO MORE OF IT HAPPENING.
I DO
20:26:22  SUPPORT INCREASING THE PER 
SQUARE FOOT
20:26:25  FEE FOR TOWN HOMES 
TO $50.
THE
20:26:28  NEXUS STUDY DID SAY THAT THE 
MARKET SUPPORTS
20:26:32  THAT.
AND I
20:26:35  THINK, YOU KNOW, IT'S A 
TRADEOFF,
20:26:38  OBVIOUSLY, YES IT IS 
GOING TO INCREASE THE COST
20:26:41  FOR 
DEVELOPERS BUT IT ALSO WILL 
INCREASE THE POT OF MONEY
20:26:43  
AVAILABLE TO DEVELOP OAFFORDABLE 
HOUSING.

20:26:46 SO I WOULD VERY MUCH SUPPORT 
MAKING
20:26:50  THAT AN ALTERNATIVE 
RESOLUTION TO MAKE THAT CHANGE
20:26:55 .
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU, 
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN.
20:26:58 
NEXT IS COUNCILMEMBER COX.

20:27:03 >> Councilmember Cox:   MY 
APOLOGIES
20:27:06  YOU'RE ON MUTE.
>> Councilmember Cox:   IF WE 
INCREASE THE
20:27:10  FEE LEVEL FOR 
FOR-SALE PROJECTS TO
20:27:13  $44, IS FOR 
SQUARE FOOT
20:27:16 , WHERE IS THAT 
RANKED
20:27:20 ?
YOU KNOW, ARE WE IN THE MIDDLE
20:27:23 , 
ARE WE NEAR THE BOTTOM OF THE
20:27:25  
TOP?
I JUST WANT TO KIND OF 

20:27:29 UNDERSTAND WHERE ARE WE PLACED 
IN THE MARKET IF WE GO TO THAT
20:27:31  
RATE?
>> Dan Schoenholz:   THAT WOULD 

20:27:36 PUT US, THE $44 IS HIGHER THAN 
ANY
20:27:39  OF THE SURROUNDING CITIES 
THAT WE LOOKED AT.
SAN JOSE DOES HAVE
20:27:42  A $43 FEE
20:27:46  
FOR, I THINK THE IT'S
20:27:49  A SPECIFIC  
GEOGRAPHIC AREA.
IT
20:27:53  DOESN'T COVER DID ENTIRE 
COMMUNITY BUT THEY HAVE ONE 
SCENARIO
20:27:57  WHERE THE FEE IS 
$AG
20:28:00  $43.
SO IT WOULD BE CLOSE TO THAT.
BUT OTHER THAN THAT
20:28:03  WE DIDN'T 
SEE ANYTHING IN THE 40s.
20:28:06 
I THINK THE LOW 30s, HIGH 
20s
20:28:09  WE SAW IN SOME OTHER 
COMMUNITIES
20:28:12 .
>> Councilmember Cox:   SO WHAT 
WOULD BE NEARBY
20:28:15  FOR NEWARK AND 
UNION CITY, WHAT WOULD BE THEIR 
RATES?
20:28:19 
I'M JUST CURIOUS, YOU TO HAYWARD 
AND JUST KIND
20:28:22  OF SEEING WHERE 
ARE WE ON THE EAST BAY
20:28:26 ?
>> SO THIS IS DAVID D
20:28:29 OZEMA WITH
20:28:32  
KEYSER-MARSTON.
UNION CITY IS ABOUT $27
20:28:35  PER 
SQUARE FOOT.
NEWARK I DON'T HAVE
20:28:39  HANDY BUT 
HAYWARD IS AT $19 PER SQUARE 
FOOT.

20:28:42 WE LOOKED AT LIVERMORE, THEY'RE 
AT
20:28:45  $28 PER SQUARE FOOT.
>> Councilmember Cox:   WHAT
20:28:48  
ABOUT MEN TON
20:28:52  PLEASANTON
20:28:56 ?
>> I DON'T HAVE THAT HANDY.
MILPITAS THEY'RE
20:29:00  AT 33.
SAN JOSE AS MR. SCHOENHOLZ
20:29:03  
MENTIONED IS AT $43 PER RENTALS 
AND
20:29:06  THEY HAVE $25 FOR FOR-SALE.

20:29:10 >> Councilmember Cox:   THAT 
STILL PUTS US UP THERE PRETTY 
HIGH
20:29:13 .
>> YES.
SO I THINK, I
20:29:17  THINK THE BROAD 
PICTURE IS THAT THAT FOR-SALE 
FEE
20:29:21  IS TOWARDS THE HIGH END.
AND
20:29:24  THE RENTAL IS TOWARDS THE 
LOW END.
AND THE
20:29:27  STACKED-FLAT-CONDO 
RECOMMENDATIONS ARE
20:29:30  RIGHT IN THE 
MIDDLE IS SORT OF HOW I WOULD 
PUT IT.

20:29:35 >> Councilmember Cox:   RIGHT 
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE
20:29:38  NOT 
TOUCHING IS THE STACKED, THE 
OTHER ONES, THE TOWN
20:29:41  HOUSE, ARE 
WE BUILDING, DO WE HAVE A 
TENDENCY
20:29:44  TO BUILD MORE TOWN 
HOUSES NOW IT LOOKS LIKE
20:29:47  THAN 
SINGLE FAMILY HOMES?
WOOU SAY THAT'S A
20:29:50  FAIR 
ASSESSMENT GOING IN THE FUTURE?
>> I WOULD.

20:29:55 >> Councilmember Cox:   HOW 
LIKELY, ARE YOU THINKING IT'S 
TWO TO
20:29:58  ONE NOW?
>> Dan Schoenholz:   YEAH,
20:30:01  I  
MEAN I THINK
20:30:04  -- WE'RE SEEING 
HIGHER DENSITY
20:30:08  DEVELOPMENT SO I 
THINK YOU SEE MORE TOWN HOMES 
THAN SINGLE
20:30:11  FAMILY HOMES AND MAY 
SEE MORE STACKED FLATS
20:30:14  THAN TOWN 
HOMES IN THE FUTURE.
20:30:17 
>> Councilmember Cox:   OKAY.
I JUST THINK THAT 44 IS STILL
20:30:20  
QUITE HIGH WHEN OTHERS ARE MUCH
20:30:23  
LESS.
I DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY ARE IN 

20:30:27 TERMS OF THEIR REASSESSMENT
20:30:30  OF 
LOOKING FORWARD.
BUT WHEN EVERYBODY
20:30:33  ELSE
20:30:37  IS 27, 
28, 23, 19, 25
20:30:41 , 44 IS PRETTY 
STEEP COMPARED TO THE REST OF 
THE SURROUND
20:30:44 ING AREAS THERE.
AND MAYBE LOOKING
20:30:47  AT, YOU KNOW, 
$39 OR SOMETHING
20:30:51 , 40, AROUND 
THERE.

20:30:54 AND IN TERMS OF THE
20:30:58  -- HAVING 
THE FEE INCREASE INTO
20:31:01  TWO STEPS, 
WHY TWO STEPS, VERSUS LOOKING
20:31:04  AT 
IT GOING INTO THREE, DOING
20:31:07  A 
THREE-STEP?
BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE $
20:31:10 8 ONE 
INCREASE ONE YEAR AND THEN 
HITTING
20:31:13  UP ANOTHER EIGHT OR 9 
THE FOLLOWING YEAR AS OPPOSED
20:31:17  TO 
KIND OF SMOOTHING IS IT OUT A 
LITTLE BIT MORE
20:31:20 .
>> Dan Schoenholz:   RIGHT, 
YEAH, WE RECOMMENDED
20:31:23  THE TWO 
STEPS.
IT WAS REALLY KIND OF
20:31:26  BASED ON 
COUNCIL INTEREST AND DIRECTION 
AROUND TRYING TO INCREASE
20:31:28  HAD 
RESOURCES FOR AFFORDABLE 
HOUSING.

20:31:31 SO IT WAS SORT OF TRYING TO 
BALANCE GETTING
20:31:34  MORE MONEY 
SOONER, WITH RECOGNIZE
20:31:37 ING THAT 
MARKET
20:31:41  RATE PROJECTS NEED SOME 
TIME TO ADJUST TO THE 
MARKETPLACE
20:31:44 .
SO WE CERTAINLY COULD DO
20:31:47  THREE 
STEPS, IF THAT WAS COUNCIL'S 
WISH
20:31:51 .
AND I THINK WE EVEN HAVE A
20:31:54  SLIDE 
THAT SHOWS WHAT THAT WOULD LOOK 
LIKE IF WE DID IT IN THREE
20:31:57  
STEPS.
BUT TWO STEPS IS WHAT WE THOUGHT 

20:32:00 WAS KIND OF MORE IN LINE WITH 
COUNCIL DIRECTION.
>> Councilmember Cox:  
20:32:04  CAN YOU 
SHOW US WHAT YOU HAD FOR YOUR 
PROPOSAL FOR A THREE
20:32:07 -STEP 
PLEASE?
>> YES, ALBERTO,
20:32:10  PLEASE GO TO 
SLIDE NUMBER 26.
>> Mayor Mei:   I JUST WANTED
20:32:13  TO 
NOTE ALSO WE'LL DAY ONE 
CLARIFYING QUESTION BUT
20:32:17  IT'S 
GOING TO GO LONGER WE
20:32:21  SHOULD 
PROBABLY DAY A BREAK TOO.
AFTER
20:32:24  COUNCILMEMBER KENG ASK SS 
QUESTIONS WE MIGHT HAVE TO COME 
BACK TO MAKE
20:32:28  OUR FINAL YOU 
DECISIONS.
>> HERE IS THE SLIDE
20:32:31  THAT SHOWS 
THREE STEPS INSTEAD OF TWO STEPS
20:32:33 
STEPS.
SO THE FULL FEE WILL NOT COME 

20:32:36 INTO EFFECT UNTIL 2024.
THE $44
20:32:40 .
CRZ I THINK THAT WOULD BE MORE 
REASONABLE.

20:32:44  
REASONABLE BECAUSE
20:32:47  EVERYBODY'S 
JUST COMING THROUGH GETTING BACK 
ON TRACK
20:32:50  AND BOUNCING BACK FROM 
THE PANDEMIC
20:32:55 .
AND WE KIND OF THE NEED TO
20:32:58  
SMOOTH IT OUT A LITTLE BIT AND 
SOME CONSIDERATION THERE
20:33:01  BUT NOT 
AT THE COST OF REDUCING
20:33:05  
AFFORDABLE HOUSING.
20:33:08 
THE VERY LOW INCOME.
THIS IS GOOD TO KNOW
20:33:13 .
>> Mayor Mei:   COUNCILMEMBER 
KENG CLARIFYING QUESTIONS
20:33:16  AND 
THEN I SAID AFTERWARDS I THINK
20:33:19  
WE MIGHT TAKE A QUICK BREAK 
BEFORE WE COME BACK DO MAKE
20:33:23  OUR 
FINAL COMMENTS.
20:33:25 
>> Councilmember Keng:   I 
ACTUALLY DON'T HAVE QUESTIONS AT 

20:33:28 THIS TIME, I HAVE COMMENTS.
>> Mayor Mei:   GO AHEAD AND 
MAKE YOUR COMMENTS
20:33:31 .
>> Councilmember Keng:   SURE, 
YES.

20:33:34 I DON'T THINK THAT -- YOU KNOW, 
I AM OKAY WITH THE $
20:33:38 44 BUT I 
ALSO PEOPLE THAT WE SHOULD MAKE 
IT A THREE
20:33:41 -STEP INSTEAD OF TWO.
AND
20:33:45  I DON'T THINK I'LL BE 
SUPPORTIVE FOR GOING HIGHER THAN 
THAT.

20:33:48 I THINK IT'S ALREADY PRETTY HIGH 
CONSIDERING THE BUILDING COSTS
20:33:51  
HAVE GONE UP TREMENDOUSLY DURING 
THE LAST
20:33:54  YEAR AND A HALF DURING 
PANDEMIC.
20:33:58 
AND I
20:34:03  -- YEAH I THINK WE DO WANT 
TO HAVE
20:34:06  MORE FUNDING FOR 
AFFORDABLE HOUSING
20:34:10  SO THE 
SLIDE --
>> Mayor Mei:   COUNCILMEMBER 

20:34:13 KENG, SORRY.
>> Councilmember Keng:   HELLO, 
YES
20:34:17 , I DO FEEL THAT FOR THE REST
20:34:21  
OF THE PROPOSAL, I AM
20:34:24  AGREEABLE 
WITH.
BUT I DON'T KNOW IF ANYONE ELSE
20:34:28  
ALSO FEELS LIKE, YOU KNOW,
20:34:36 , YOU KNOW, WE 
SHOULD GIVE MORE TIME INSTEAD 
OF, WE USED
20:34:39  TO HAVE THEM PAY THE 
FEES, ALLOW THEM TO
20:34:42  PAY THE FEES 
IN STAGES.
20:34:46 
AND WOULD THAT STILL BE A 
CONSIDERATION OR
20:34:49  NOT?
20:34:51 



20:34:51 



20:34:55 .
>> Mayor Mei:   SO DOES ANYONE 
ON STAFF WANT TO CLARIFY?

20:34:58 I SEE WE HAD A SPEAKER AN THIS 
EARLIER, I SEE COUNCILMEMBER 
SALWAN
20:35:01 .
I WANTED TO COMMENT THAT WE USED 
TO HAVE AN
20:35:04  INCENTIVE, I GUESS IN 
TERMS OF HOW WE HAD MARKET RATE
20:35:07  
HOUSING.
AND THAT'S THE QUESTION THAT WAS -- 
20:35:10 BUT WE HAVE NOT HAD A 
SHORTAGES OF MARKET RATE
20:35:13  HOUSING 
BEING BUILT.
WE'VE HAD MORE OF
20:35:17  A CHALLENGE IN 
TERMS OF LOW INCOME.
AND IN PARTICULAR, AS
20:35:20  I THINK
20:35:22  
COUNCILMEMBER -- I DON'T 
REMEMBER WHICH COUNCILMEMBER 

20:35:25 MENTIONED IT BUT IN PARTICULAR 
WE HAVE MORE CHALLENGES IN 
MODERATE
20:35:29  HOUSING.
I THINK IT WAS COUNCILMEMBER 
SALWAN THAT HAD MENTIONED
20:35:32  THAT 
AT THAT TIME, BECAUSE SOME OF 
THE PROGRAMS THAT HAVE BEEN PUT 

20:35:36 IN PLACE SPECIFICALLY HAVE 
TARGETED LOW AND VERY LOW INCOME 
HOUSING
20:35:40 .
SO I'M JUST WONDERING IF WE ARE
20:35:43  
MOSTLY ALIGNED WITH THE STAFF 
RECOMMENDATION?
20:35:46 
I TOO JUST WANTED TO COMMENT IN 
GENERAL THAT I
20:35:51  WOULD MAXIMUM FOR 
THE DISCUSSION OF THE PRICE 
INCREASE,
20:35:54  OR THE FEE INCREASE, 
GO UP TO 44.
I WOULD NOT
20:35:57  BE INTERESTED IN 
GOING IN EXCESS TO $BRING
20:36:01  $50.
I DO THINK 44 WOULD PUT US
20:36:04  AT 
THE HIGH END AND I DO LIKE THE
20:36:08  
THREE TIER APPROACH VERSUS THE 
TWO TIER
20:36:11 .
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN.
>> Councilmember Salwan:   MADAM 

20:36:14 MAYOR I THINK IN THE INTEREST OF 
DIME WE HAVE THE BUILDING
20:36:17  BLOCKS 
FOR A MOTION.
>> Mayor Mei:   DO YOU WANT
20:36:18  TO 
DO THAT?
>> Councilmember Salwan:   

20:36:22 ABSOLUTELY.
THE ONLY THING FOR THE 
CLARIFICATION IS THE TWO-STEP
20:36:25  
VERSUS THE THREE-STEP.
ISN'T IT STILL THE 44
20:36:28  IN THE 
TWO-STEP, I WASN'T SURE WHAT THE 
DIFFERENCE WAS
20:36:31 .
DO YOU HAVE A TWO-STEP SLIDE
20:36:35 ?
>> Mayor Mei:   I THINK IT WAS A 
DIFFERENCE OF DATES.
20:36:37 
>> Councilmember Salwan:   WAS 
IT DATES?

20:36:40 >> Dan Schoenholz:   IT WAS THE 
DATES.
IT WOULDN'T GO TO THE FULL $
20:36:43 44 
AMOUNT UNTIL HAD THE
20:36:48  2024, 
RIGHT, LUCIA?
YOU WANT TO SHOW THE SLIDE
20:36:51  
AGAIN.
>> YES, ALBERTO CAN YOU
20:36:54  SHOW 
THAT SLIDE AGAIN?
th
20:37:01 >> Councilmember Salwan:   HOW 
DOES THAT DIFFER FROM THE TWO 
STEP THE DATES
20:37:04 ?
>> THE TWO STEP WILL GO INTO 
EFFECT 20
20:37:08 23.
THIS ONE THREE STEPS WILL GO 
INTO
20:37:11  EFFECT JANUARY 2024.
AND ALBERTO IF YOU
20:37:14  CAN GO WAY UP 
TO SLIDE NUMBER 20 TO
20:37:17  SLIDE I 
WOULD SAY, LET'S SEE, AND TO
20:37:20  
SHOW THE COUNCIL THE TWO-
20:37:24 STEP.
YES, SO IF YOU CAN JUST
20:37:27  GO TO 
SLIDE I THINK
20:37:30  NUMBER
20:37:35  -- NUMBER 9 
OR NUMBER 8.
YES, NUMBER
20:37:39  8.
SO WE'RE GOING TO SHOW YOU THE 
TWO STEPS
20:37:43 .
NUMBER 8.
YES
20:37:46 .
YES.
RIGHT HERE
20:37:50 .
THESE TWO STEPS WILL SHOW YOU 
THAT THE FULL
20:37:53  FEE WILL GO INTO 
EFFECT JANUARY 2023.
20:37:56 
>> Councilmember Salwan:   OKAY 
SO I WOULD LIKE TO MOVE STAFF 

20:37:59 RECOMMENDATION WITH THE 
THREE-STEP FORMULA WITH THE
20:38:02  
20:38:06  MAX 
OF $
20:38:10 44 FOR
20:38:13  STACKED FLATS AND 
SINGLE FAMILY.
AS STAFF RECOMMENDED
20:38:16 .
>> SECOND.
>> Mayor Mei:   COMENS DID YOU 

20:38:20 HAVE
20:38:23  ANOTHER COMMENT?
>> Councilmember Kassan:   YES, 
I
20:38:26  UNDERSTAND THIS IS THE WAY 
THAT STAFF WANTS TO GO.
20:38:30 
THIS IS AN AMAZING EFFECT,
20:38:33  WE 
DON'T DO THIS VERY OFTEN AT ALL 
AND
20:38:36  WE HAVE A HORRIBLE HOUSING 
CRISIS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY.
20:38:39 
I JUST WONDER IF WE MIGHT WANT 
TO CONSIDER GOING TO
20:38:43  THE $50 PER 
SQUARE FOOT FOR TOWN
20:38:46  HOMES GIVEN 
IT WAS SHOWN AS FEASIBLE BY 
CONSULTANTS
20:38:49  THAT WE PAY A LOT OF 
MONEY TO TELL US WHAT WAS
20:38:52  
FEASIBLE AND ALSO JUST DO THE 
TWO STEPS.

20:38:55 I WOULD VERY MUCH 74th THAT 
AND I WOULDN'T BE ABLE
20:38:58  TO VOTE 
IN FAVOR OF WHAT'S BEING 
PROPOSED.
20:39:02 
IF I'M THE ONLY ONE OBVIOUSLY 
THAT IS THE WAY THE COOKIE 

20:39:05 CRUMBLES.
>> Mayor Mei:   WE HAVE A 
MOTION.

20:39:07 COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN DID YOU 
HAVE A --
>> Councilmember Shao:   I WOULD 

20:39:10 LIKE TO SECOND
20:39:14  COUNCILMEMBER 
KASSAN'S PROPOSAL TO
20:39:17  INCREASE 
THE FEE FOR
20:39:20  THE TOWN HOUSES TO 
$50 PER SQUARE FEET
20:39:23 .
>> Mayor Mei:   OKAY
20:39:27 .
WELL, WE HAVE A --
20:39:30  I'M GOING TO 
TURN IT TO --
>> Councilmember Salwan:  
20:39:33  JUST 
FOR UNDERSTANDING --
20:39:36 
>> Mayor Mei:   WE HAVE A MOTION 
AND SECOND CLARIFYING
20:39:39  DEBRA DO 
WE VOTE ON THE FIRST ONE?
THIS IS A
20:39:43  SECOND, A FRIENDLY 
AMENDMENT, IT'S NOT BEING
20:39:46  PUT 
THROUGH --
>> Ms. Margolis:   THAT'S WHAT
20:39:49  I 
WANTED TO CLARIFY.
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, ARE YOU 

20:39:53 MAKING AN ALTERNATIVE HE MOTION?
>> Councilmember Kassan:   YES.
>> Ms. Margolis:  
20:39:56  WE HAVE AN 
ALTERNATIVE MOTION WITH A 
SECOND,
20:39:59  YOU NEED TO VOTE ON THAT 
ALTERNATIVE FIRST.
>> Mayor Mei:  
20:40:02  THAT'S WHAT I 
WANTED TO CLARIFY.
>> Councilmember Salwan:   JUST 

20:40:05 TO DISTINGUISH YOU'RE 
DISTINGUISHING THE FEE FOR TOWN 
HOMES VERSUS
20:40:09  SINGLE FAMILY 
RESIDENCE.
I'M TRYING
20:40:12  TO UNDERSTAND THE 
LOGIC ONE VERSUS DID OTHER?
>> Councilmember Kassan:  
20:40:15  
BECAUSE THE NEXUS OR FEASIBILITY 
STUDY
20:40:18  SHOWS THAT $50 IS FEASIBLE 
FOR TOWN
20:40:22  HOMES BUT ONLY $44 IS 
FEASIBLE
20:40:25  FOR SINGLE FAMILY.
JUST TO FOLLOW
20:40:28  DID DIRECTION OUR
20:40:30  
CONSULTANTS PREPARED.
>> Councilmember Salwan:   IS 

20:40:33 THAT CORRECT LUCIA OR BEN?
>> YES, THAT'S CORRECT.
20:40:36 
>> Councilmember Cox:   WHEN WAS 
THE STUDY DONE?

20:40:39 >> IT WAS DONE A LITTLE BIT 
BEFORE OCTOBER 20
20:40:42 20.
>> Councilmember Cox:   YEAH
20:40:45 , 
THE PRICE OF LUMBER AND STEEL 
HAVE SKYROCKETED
20:40:48 .
>> Mayor Mei:   I ALSO WANTED 
JUST
20:40:51  TO CLARIFY THAT REGARDLESS, 
THIS WOULD PUT US OUTSIDE
20:40:54  THE 
NORM.
DAVID IF THAT'S CORRECT, I THINK 

20:40:58 THAT $50 WOULD BE AT THE HEIGHT 
FOR ANY OF
20:41:01  OUR SURROUNDING 
CITIES, CORRECT, THAT SURROUND 
US
20:41:04 ?
>> THAT'S CORRECT.
>> Mayor Mei:   OKAY
20:41:07 .
COUNCILMEMBER JONES.
YOUR HAND RAISED
20:41:10 .
>> Councilmember Jones:   YOU 
JUST ASKED MY QUESTION, 

20:41:13 ACTUALLY.
>> Mayor Mei:   OKAY, IN THAT 
CASE, ROLL CALL VOTE
20:41:16  PLEASE.
>> Councilmember Cox:   SO WAIT 
A MINUTE.
20:41:19 
LET'S JUST CLARIFY WHAT ARE WE 
VOTING ON AGAIN
20:41:23 ?
>> Mayor Mei:   THIS IS THE 
ALTERNATIVE
20:41:25 .
>> Ms. Margolis:   ON THE 
ALTERNATIVE MOTION --

20:41:28 >> Councilmember Cox:   FOR $50.
>> Ms. Margolis:   INCREASING 
THE
20:41:31  FEE ON TOWN HOMES FOR $50.
>> Mayor Mei:   AND
20:41:34  TWO TIER 
VERSUS -- TWO-
20:41:37 STEP VERSUS A 
THREE-STEP.
20:41:41 
>> Ms. Margolis:   BUT OTHERWISE 
YOU WOULD BE FOLLOWING
20:41:44  STAFF 
RECOMMENDATION FOR EVERYTHING 
ELSE
20:41:47 .
>> YES.
>> Mayor Mei:  
20:41:50  ROLL CALL VOTE 
PLEASE ON THE ALTERNATIVE.
AND AGAIN I THINK IF
20:41:54  ANYONE 
ANSWER UNCLEAR IF THIS IS THE 
ALTERNATIVE MOTION THAT WAS MADE
20:41:58  
BY COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN AND 
SECONDED BY VICE MAYOR SHAO.

20:42:04 >> The Clerk:   ON THE 
ALTERNATIVE MOTION.
20:42:08 
ROLL CALL VOTE IS COUNCILMEMBER 
COX.

20:42:11 >> Councilmember Cox:   NO.

20:42:15 >> The Clerk:   COUNCILMEMBER 
SALWAN.
20:42:18 
>> Councilmember Salwan:   NAY.

20:42:22 >> The Clerk:   COUNCILMEMBER 
KASSAN.
>> Councilmember Kassan:   YES.

20:42:27 >> The Clerk:   COUNCILMEMBER 
JONES.
>> Councilmember Jones:   NAY.

20:42:32 >> The Clerk:   COUNCILMEMBER 
KENG.
.

20:42:35 >> Councilmember Keng:   NAY.

20:42:40 >> Councilmember Salwan:   VICE 
MAYOR SHAO
20:42:43 .
>> Councilmember Shao:   YEA
20:42:47 .
>> The Clerk:   MAYOR MEI.
>> Mayor Mei:   NAY.

20:42:50 SO THE ALTERNATIVE MOTION FAILS 
WITH TWO AYES AND
20:42:53  FIVE NAYS.
20:42:56 
NOW WE'LL GO BACK TO THE MOTION 
THAT WAS MADE BY COUNCILMEMBER 

20:43:00 COX AND SECONDED BY 
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN.
I BELIEVE
20:43:04 .
>> Councilmember Cox:   I THINK 
IT SWITCHED ON THAT ONE
20:43:08 .
>> IT WAS SALWAN SECONDED
20:43:11  BY 
COX.
>> Mayor Mei:   MOTION
20:43:15  BY 
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN AND 
SECONDED BY COX
20:43:18 .
DID WE COULD CLARIFY 
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN YOU MOVED 

20:43:21 THAT ONE.
>> Councilmember Salwan:   YES, 
MOVING STAFF
20:43:24  RECOMMENDATION, 
DOING IT IN THREE TIERS AS FAR 
AS THE PRICE INCREASE
20:43:27 ING AND WE 
ARE CAPPING IT AT $44 FOR
20:43:30  TOWN 
HOMES AS WELL AS SINGLE FAMILY 
RESIDENTS
20:43:34 .
>> Mayor Mei:   SO WITH THAT MAY 
I HAVE A ROLL CALL VOTE PLEASE.

20:43:37 >> The Clerk:   YES MADAM MAYOR.
COUNCILMEMBER COX.
>> Councilmember Cox:   AYE
20:43:39 .
>> The Clerk:   COUNCILMEMBER 
SALWAN.

20:43:42 >> Councilmember Salwan:   AYE.
>> The Clerk:   COUNCILMEMBER 
KASSAN.
20:43:45 
>> Councilmember Kassan:   NO.

20:43:48 >> The Clerk:   COUNCILMEMBER 
JONES.
>> Councilmember Jones:   AYE.

20:43:51 >> The Clerk:   COUNCILMEMBER 
KENG.
>> Councilmember Keng:   AYE
20:43:55 .
>> The Clerk:   VICE MAYOR SHAO.
20:43:58 
>> Councilmember Shao:   NAY.
>> The Clerk:   MAYOR MEI.

20:44:01 >> Mayor Mei:   AYE.
SO THE MATTER PASSES
20:44:05  WITH 
AFFORDABLE HOUSING MR. PRESIDENT 
WHICH WILL BE AT THE MAXIMUM
20:44:08  
WHICH WAS THE ONLY CONTENTIOUS 
ITEM, $
20:44:11 44 FOR BOTH SINGLE FAMILY 
AND TOWN HOMES AND GOING THROUGH
20:44:14  
A THIRD STEP DEAF A
20:44:17  INSTEAD OF A TWO
20:44:20 
TWO-STEP.
WITH THAT, THAT IS
20:44:23  I THINK THIS IS A OUR 
LAST AGENDA
20:44:27  ITEM THIS EVENING.
AND SEEING NO OTHER THINGS, I 
WAS IS
20:44:30  GOING TO JUST LET PEOPLE 
KNOW THAT I APPRECIATE ALL THOSE 
WHO
20:44:33  CAME OUT TO OUR DOWNTOWN 
EVENT CENTER.
AND
20:44:36  WE APPRECIATE ALL THOSE WHO 
ARE WORKING WITH US TO KEEP 
THINGS
20:44:39  GOING IN THE COMMUNITIES.
20:44:43 
STAYING HEALTHY.
WE ARE NOW AT 97.5%
20:44:46  SINGLE SHOT 
VACCINATED.
84
20:44:49 .4% FULLY VACCINATED.
WE ARE
20:44:52  ACTUALLY TIED WITH OTHER 
CITIES FOR FIRST PLACE I THINK
20:44:55  
IN THE COUNTY FOR SINGLE SHOT 
WITH PIEDMONT AND
20:44:58  I THINK
20:45:02  THE 
ALBANY OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD 
AND WE ARE
20:45:05  LOOKING TO
20:45:15  THE THIRD 
DOSE AS NECESSARY.
20:45:18 
STAY HEALTH, BE CONSCIENTIOUS, I 
DMEND
20:45:22  THE STAFF FOR YOUR EFFORTS 
AT BEING GREEN
20:45:25  AND 
DISEANABILITY.
AND AGAIN, ASK PEOPLE
20:45:28  TO THINK 
ABOUT CREATING AWARENESS, WHO 
FILE THERE IS
20:45:31  A NEED FOR 
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND AWARENESS, 
THIS IS THE
20:45:34  MONTH TO DO THAT AND 
ALSO FOR ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH,
20:45:36  
MENTAL HEALTH FOR US.
THANK YOU SO MUCH AND I'LL 

20:45:40 ADJOURN THE MEETING THIS EVENING
