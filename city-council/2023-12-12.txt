[Captioner] 19:12:01
HOPE YOU WILL CONSIDER JOINING 

[Captioner] 19:12:02
SOME OF OUR HISTORIC BUSINESS 

[Captioner] 19:12:02
DISTRICTS TOO.

[Captioner] 19:12:03
I THINK THOSE ARE ALL 

[Captioner] 19:12:06
PARTNERSHIPS THAT ARE CRITICAL.

[Captioner] 19:12:08
 SO WITH THAT, I'M GOING TO GO 

[Captioner] 19:12:10
BACK TO THE ITEM THAT WAS 

[Captioner] 19:12:10
PULLED.

[Captioner] 19:12:12
>> Ms. Gauthier: WE HAVE PUBLIC 

[Captioner] 19:12:12
COMMENT.

[Captioner] 19:12:13
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY, DO WE HAVE 

[Captioner] 19:12:14
SPEAKERS FOR THAT?

[Captioner] 19:12:15
>> Ms. Gauthier: TWO.

[Captioner] 19:12:16
>> Mayor Mei: COULD YOU PLEASE 

[Captioner] 19:12:18
CALL THE SPEAKER, WE'LL GIVE 

[Captioner] 19:12:18
THEM 3 MINUTES EACH.

[Captioner] 19:12:19
WELCOME.

[Captioner] 19:12:29
>> Ms. Gauthier: BEN YEE 

[Captioner] 19:12:32
FOLLOWED BY RIZWA ASHRAF.

[Captioner] 19:12:35
>> GOOD EVENING, MAYOR AND CITY 

[Captioner] 19:12:36
COUNCIL AND STAFF.

[Captioner] 19:12:38
MY NAME IS BEN YEE.

[Captioner] 19:12:40
I THINK YOU ALL KNOW WHO I AM 

[Captioner] 19:12:42
AND I'M HERE AS A PRIVATE 

[Captioner] 19:12:45
CITIZEN, AND I SEE ONE OF THE 

[Captioner] 19:12:46
PEOPLE THAT IS ABOUT TO RETIRE 

[Captioner] 19:12:47
AT THE END OF THIS MONTH.

[Captioner] 19:12:48
I'M GOING TO MISS YOU.

[Captioner] 19:12:51
SO -- BUT ANYHOW, THE REASON WHY 

[Captioner] 19:12:53
I'M HERE IS BECAUSE OF HER 

[Captioner] 19:12:54
RETIREMENT, THAT MEANS THAT 

[Captioner] 19:12:57
THERE'S ACTUALLY AN OPENING IN 

[Captioner] 19:13:00
-- I CAN'T REMEMBER THE TITLE, 

[Captioner] 19:13:00
COMMUNITY SERVICES.

[Captioner] 19:13:03
AND WITH THAT, I JUST WANT TO 

[Captioner] 19:13:04
SHARE WITH YOU WHAT'S CURRENTLY 

[Captioner] 19:13:08
ON OUR MANAGEMENT TEAM CITY WEBSITE.

[Captioner] 19:13:15
SO I KNOW IT'S NOT GOING TO BE 

[Captioner] 19:13:18
THAT EASY TO SEE -- OH, THERE WE 

[Captioner] 19:13:18
GO.

[Captioner] 19:13:19
YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO ANY FURTHER 

[Captioner] 19:13:21
THAN THAT.

[Captioner] 19:13:23
BUT THERE IS SOMETHING MISSING 

[Captioner] 19:13:24
THAT'S THERE.

[Captioner] 19:13:26
THAT YOU ACTUALLY CAN SEE.

[Captioner] 19:13:30
WE'RE A CITY WITH ALMOST CLOSE 

[Captioner] 19:13:33
TO 70% ASIANS, YET I DON'T SEE 

[Captioner] 19:13:35
AN ASIAN NAME WHATSOEVER ON THAT 

[Captioner] 19:13:35
PAGE.

[Captioner] 19:13:40
SO I WOULD IMPLORE OUR CITY 

[Captioner] 19:13:44
STAFF AND HR TO HOPEFULLY FIND 

[Captioner] 19:13:47
AN APPROPRIATE ASIAN CANDIDATE 

[Captioner] 19:13:49
THAT WOULD BE ABLE TO FILL THIS 

[Captioner] 19:13:50
POSITION, BECAUSE AS YOU CAN 

[Captioner] 19:13:55
SEE, IT'S STATISTICALLY

[Captioner] 19:13:57
 NOT WHAT I COULD SEE IN 

[Captioner] 19:13:58
MATHEMATIC PERSPECTIVE TO HAVE 

[Captioner] 19:14:00
ALMOST 70% ASIANS HERE IN THIS 

[Captioner] 19:14:02
CITY AND NOT HAVE ONE ASIAN 

[Captioner] 19:14:03
REPRESENTING ANY ONE OF THE 17 

[Captioner] 19:14:04
DEPARTMENTS.

[Captioner] 19:14:05
SO I JUST WANTED TO SHARE THAT 

[Captioner] 19:14:07
AND BRING THAT TO EVERYONE'S 

[Captioner] 19:14:08
ATTENTION, BECAUSE THAT'S 

[Captioner] 19:14:10
CURRENTLY WHAT WE SEE ON THE 

[Captioner] 19:14:13
MANAGEMENT TEAM WEBPAGE AND LIKE 

[Captioner] 19:14:15
I SAID, 70% ALMOST ASIANS HERE 

[Captioner] 19:14:18
IN THIS CITY, YET I DON'T SEE 

[Captioner] 19:14:19
ANY ASIAN REPRESENTATION 

[Captioner] 19:14:20
WHATSOEVER IN ANY OF THE 

[Captioner] 19:14:20
DEPARTMENTS.

[Captioner] 19:14:22
THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 19:14:33
>> HELLO.

[Captioner] 19:14:35
I'M REPRESENTING THE UNIFIED 

[Captioner] 19:14:35
MUSLIM SOCIETY.

[Captioner] 19:14:37
WE ARE MUSLIM COMMUNITY HERE IN 

[Captioner] 19:14:38
FREMONT.

[Captioner] 19:14:41
AND HAVE A WONDERFUL INTEGRATION 

[Captioner] 19:14:42
HERE AND WE ARE VERY PROUD TO BE 

[Captioner] 19:14:44
PART OF THE FREMONT CITY.

[Captioner] 19:14:48
WE HAVE A LOT OF LIKE RESPECTFUL 

[Captioner] 19:14:49
INTERACTIONS, COMMUNICATION WITH 

[Captioner] 19:14:50
MANY COMMUNITIES, ESPECIALLY 

[Captioner] 19:14:51
WITH THE ASIAN AMERICAN SIKH 

[Captioner] 19:14:53
COMMUNITY, ALL OF THAT, AND THIS 

[Captioner] 19:14:57
POINT THAT WE DON'T HAVE THE 

[Captioner] 19:14:57
REPRESENTATION IN THE CITY 

[Captioner] 19:14:59
DEPARTMENTS HAS BEEN COMING SO 

[Captioner] 19:15:00
MUCH BECAUSE OUR NON-PROFIT 

[Captioner] 19:15:01
ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE HAVING A 

[Captioner] 19:15:05
VERY, VERY HARD TIME TO HAVE 

[Captioner] 19:15:07
THAT BASICALLY PRESENTING THE 

[Captioner] 19:15:08
CONCERNS AND THE PROGRAMS THAT 

[Captioner] 19:15:10
WE WANT TO BUILD FOR OUR 

[Captioner] 19:15:12
CHILDREN, FOR OUR ELDERLY ISSUES 

[Captioner] 19:15:14
THAT WE ARE SEEING, AND WE WANT 

[Captioner] 19:15:15
THAT REPRESENTATION HERE, SO WE 

[Captioner] 19:15:18
WERE HAVING DISCUSSIONS WITH THE 

[Captioner] 19:15:21
ASIAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY FOR SO 

[Captioner] 19:15:22
MANY CIVIC ISSUES, AND THIS 

[Captioner] 19:15:23
POINT WAS COMING THAT WE DON'T 

[Captioner] 19:15:27
HAVE OFFICIALS IN THE CITY 

[Captioner] 19:15:28
DEPARTMENT THAT -- TO BE PART OF 

[Captioner] 19:15:30
THE CITY, SO THIS IS A CONCERN 

[Captioner] 19:15:31
THAT WE WANT TO RAISE AND WE 

[Captioner] 19:15:33
WANT TO RESPECTFULLY ASK TO 

[Captioner] 19:15:35
PLEASE CONSIDER INVITING FOR 

[Captioner] 19:15:37
DIVERSITY TO HAVE THE ASIAN 

[Captioner] 19:15:37
AMERICANS ALSO BE PART OF THE 

[Captioner] 19:15:38
CITY DEPARTMENTS.

[Captioner] 19:15:38
THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 19:15:46
>> Ms. Gauthier: THAT WAS THE 

[Captioner] 19:15:47
LAST SPEAKER FOR ORAL 

[Captioner] 19:15:47
COMMUNICATIONS.

[Captioner] 19:15:54
LET ME CHECK.

[Captioner] 19:16:08
JOANN SCHWOB.

[Captioner] 19:16:14
>> Mayor Mei: WELCOME, JOANN.

[Captioner] 19:16:17
>> Ms. Gauthier: MS. SCHWOB, YOU 

[Captioner] 19:16:19
CANNOT SPEAK ON 2C OR 2F.

[Captioner] 19:16:20
THAT WAS ALREADY VOTED ON UNDER 

[Captioner] 19:16:21
CONSENT CALENDAR.

[Captioner] 19:16:23
BUT YOU HAVE THE FLOOR FOR 3 

[Captioner] 19:16:24
MINUTES FOR PUBLIC COMMENT.

[Captioner] 19:16:26
>> I'M SORRY, DID THEY -- DID 

[Captioner] 19:16:28
THE AGENDA ITEM ALREADY GET 

[Captioner] 19:16:29
SPOKEN ON?

[Captioner] 19:16:30
>> Ms. Gauthier: IT WAS ON THE 

[Captioner] 19:16:31
CONSENT CALENDAR AND THEY VOTED 

[Captioner] 19:16:33
ON THE CONSENT CALENDAR SO 

[Captioner] 19:16:34
YOU'VE MISSED THOSE TWO ITEMS.

[Captioner] 19:16:36
>> WHAT CHOICE DO WE HAVE TO 

[Captioner] 19:16:36
VOTE?

[Captioner] 19:16:41
THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME SPEAK.

[Captioner] 19:16:43
MY NAME IS JOANN SCHWOB.

[Captioner] 19:16:45
LONG TIME RESIDENT OF FREMONT.

[Captioner] 19:16:50
AND MY UNDERSTANDING IS THE CITY 

[Captioner] 19:16:54
COUNCIL APPROVED PLANS TO 

[Captioner] 19:16:57
INSTALL A DOG PARK AND A PICKLE 

[Captioner] 19:17:00
PARK AT VALLEJO MILL, WHICH IS A 

[Captioner] 19:17:05
CALIFORNIA REGISTERED STATE 

[Captioner] 19:17:05
HISTORIC LANDMARK.

[Captioner] 19:17:10
IN ADDITION, I UNDERSTAND THAT

[Captioner] 19:17:12
 THEY WAIVED THE CEQA PROCESS, 

[Captioner] 19:17:18
THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL 

[Captioner] 19:17:20
QUALITY WHATEVER ELSE THE 

[Captioner] 19:17:22
ACRONYM STANDS FOR.

[Captioner] 19:17:25
THAT THEY WAIVED THAT REVIEW.

[Captioner] 19:17:27
IS THE CITY COUNCIL AWARE, AND 

[Captioner] 19:17:31
THEY SHOULD BE, THAT THERE ARE

[Captioner] 19:17:36
 15 -- AT LEAST 15 ENDANGERED

[Captioner] 19:17:41
 SPECIES OF MAMMALS, ANIMALS, 

[Captioner] 19:17:45
AMPHIBIANS, REPTILES AND PLANTS 

[Captioner] 19:17:47
IN THAT PARTICULAR AREA, 

[Captioner] 19:17:47
PERIOD?

[Captioner] 19:17:52
AND IT WOULD BE JUST A TRAVESTY 

[Captioner] 19:17:55
IF THE CITY CONTINUES WITH THEIR 

[Captioner] 19:17:59
PLANS TO INSTALL ANYTHING, 

[Captioner] 19:18:01
ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THAT IS PART 

[Captioner] 19:18:05
OF A PROTECTED OPEN SPACE THAT 

[Captioner] 19:18:09
THE CITY RESIDENTS VOTED

[Captioner] 19:18:11
 ON TWICE, AND TO DO ANYTHING 

[Captioner] 19:18:12
DIFFERENT WOULD BE UNLAWFUL.

[Captioner] 19:18:14
IT WOULD NOT ONLY BE UNLAWFUL, 

[Captioner] 19:18:19
BUT IT WOULD BE IMMORAL TO THINK

[Captioner] 19:18:22
 THAT THE CITY WOULD CONTINUE 

[Captioner] 19:18:25
WITH PLANS TO WIPE OUT 15 

[Captioner] 19:18:25
ENDANGERED SPECIES.

[Captioner] 19:18:29
AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT NOT JUST 

[Captioner] 19:18:34
A FROG OR A LIZARD, BUT IN

[Captioner] 19:18:38
 ADDITION TO KIT FOX, BARN OWL,

[Captioner] 19:18:40
 THE MOUNTAIN LION, JUST TO NAME 

[Captioner] 19:18:40
A FEW.

[Captioner] 19:18:47
I IMPLORE THE CITY COUNCIL TO

[Captioner] 19:18:52
 PLEASE HOLD OFF ON ANY PLANS

[Captioner] 19:18:54
 WHATSOEVER TO THIS PARTICULAR 

[Captioner] 19:18:58
AREA UNTIL THEY ACTUALLY DO A REVIEW.

[Captioner] 19:19:02
THERE WAS A REVIEW DONE WITH

[Captioner] 19:19:07
 THE PARKS DISTRICT FOR

[Captioner] 19:19:11
 ALAMEDA COUNTY, AND IT WAS FROM 

[Captioner] 19:19:13
THAT REVIEW THAT I RECEIVED OR 

[Captioner] 19:19:15
GOT MY INFORMATION FROM, AND 

[Captioner] 19:19:17
THEY WORKED WITH THE CITY OF 

[Captioner] 19:19:18
FREMONT ON THE AREA, SO THERE'S 

[Captioner] 19:19:20
NO EXCUSE WHY THE CITY COUNCIL 

[Captioner] 19:19:24
DOES NOT KNOW THAT THERE ARE 

[Captioner] 19:19:24
ENDANGERED ANIMALS.

[Captioner] 19:19:28
AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.

[Captioner] 19:19:35
>> Ms. Gauthier: SALEEM HAS NOW 

[Captioner] 19:19:36
TURNED IN A CARD FOR PUBLIC 

[Captioner] 19:19:36
COMMENT.

[Captioner] 19:19:37
>> Mayor Mei: PLEASE, CALL THE 

[Captioner] 19:19:38
NEXT SPEAKER.

[Captioner] 19:19:40
I JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY THAT 

[Captioner] 19:19:42
NEITHER 2C NOR 2F, JUST IN CASE 

[Captioner] 19:19:44
YOU WERE WONDERING, JOANN, WERE 

[Captioner] 19:19:45
PERTAINING TO VALLEJO MILLS PARK.

[Captioner] 19:19:48
>> GOOD EVENING, MAYOR AND THE 

[Captioner] 19:19:48
CITY STAFF.

[Captioner] 19:19:50
AND THE COUNCILMEMBERS.

[Captioner] 19:19:54
I'M HERE FOR TWO POINTS, AND THE 

[Captioner] 19:19:54
MANAGER.

[Captioner] 19:19:56
TWO POINTS.

[Captioner] 19:20:00
NUMBER ONE, I HAD APPLIED TO THE

[Captioner] 19:20:03
 CITY'S $30 MILLION AMOUNT THAT 

[Captioner] 19:20:07
WAS SET ASIDE FOR LOW COST 

[Captioner] 19:20:10
HOUSING, HOMELESS SHELTER, BELOW 

[Captioner] 19:20:11
MARKET RATE HOUSING AND ALL OF THAT.

[Captioner] 19:20:16
THERE IS A HOTEL CALLED THE

[Captioner] 19:20:17
 BOLIVIER HOTEL WHICH IS A 

[Captioner] 19:20:19
25-ACRE PROPERTY THAT I HAVE 

[Captioner] 19:20:22
BEEN TRYING TO GET TO CONVERT IT 

[Captioner] 19:20:26
INTO A HOTEL FOR THE

[Captioner] 19:20:29
 BATTERED WOMEN -- PEOPLE AND MY 

[Captioner] 19:20:31
APPLICATION WAS TURNED DOWN 

[Captioner] 19:20:34
BECAUSE THE ANSWER GIVEN WAS, I 

[Captioner] 19:20:35
DON'T HAVE ENOUGH EXPERIENCE.

[Captioner] 19:20:39
AFTER 45 YEARS DOING THIS WORK, 

[Captioner] 19:20:41
IF I DON'T HAVE ANY EXPERIENCE, 

[Captioner] 19:20:43
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS THE 

[Captioner] 19:20:44
CRITERIA FOR EXPERIENCE.

[Captioner] 19:20:47
SO THAT IS POINT NUMBER ONE I 

[Captioner] 19:20:52
WOULD LIKE THE CITY STAFF, THE 

[Captioner] 19:20:53
COUNCILMEMBERS AND THE MAYOR TO 

[Captioner] 19:20:57
LOOK INTO THIS ISSUE, AND WE ARE

[Captioner] 19:21:01
 SPENDING HALF A MILLION DOLLARS 

[Captioner] 19:21:05
TO HOUSE 90 PEOPLE THIS WINTER, 

[Captioner] 19:21:06
AND EVERY YEAR DURING THE RAIN 

[Captioner] 19:21:10
AND THE WINTER, HOTEL ROOMS ARE 

[Captioner] 19:21:15
BOOKED, ABOUT $90 A NIGHT, 90

[Captioner] 19:21:19
 PEOPLE, $90,000 -- $9,000 A

[Captioner] 19:21:22
 DAY, $270,000 A MONTH, THREE 

[Captioner] 19:21:24
MONTHS THAT THEY'RE RENTING, 

[Captioner] 19:21:28
HALF A MILLION DOLLARS OR MORE 

[Captioner] 19:21:31
ARE SPENT JUST TO GET THOSE 

[Captioner] 19:21:31
ROOMS.

[Captioner] 19:21:33
THIS IS A PLACE WHICH WILL BE 

[Captioner] 19:21:37
PERMANENTLY USED AND THE REPLY 

[Captioner] 19:21:39
WAS I DON'T HAVE ANY 

[Captioner] 19:21:39
EXPERIENCE.

[Captioner] 19:21:44
SO I WOULD LIKE TO BRING THIS TO 

[Captioner] 19:21:45
THE CITY STAFF AND THE COUNCIL, 

[Captioner] 19:21:47
AND I WOULD LIKE THIS TO BE -- 

[Captioner] 19:21:50
THIS THING SHOULD BE BROUGHT UP 

[Captioner] 19:21:51
THAT SPENDING THIS KIND OF 

[Captioner] 19:21:53
MONEY, HALF A MILLION DOLLARS 

[Captioner] 19:21:56
FOR THREE MONTHS, I THINK IS 

[Captioner] 19:22:01
SOMETHING WHICH IS NOT VERY -- I 

[Captioner] 19:22:05
DON'T HAVE THE WORDS -- NICE,

[Captioner] 19:22:10
 INVITING, FRUGAL,

[Captioner] 19:22:10
 SENSIBLE, WHATEVER.

[Captioner] 19:22:11
THAT IS POINT NUMBER ONE.

[Captioner] 19:22:13
THE SECOND POINT THAT I WANT TO 

[Captioner] 19:22:19
RAISE IS THAT I HAVE BEEN

[Captioner] 19:22:22
 ASKING TO FORM A COMMITTEE TO 

[Captioner] 19:22:25
MAKE THE FIVE ROADS INTO 

[Captioner] 19:22:25
SOMETHING MODERN.

[Captioner] 19:22:28
I STILL WOULD LIKE TO GET THE 

[Captioner] 19:22:30
FEEDBACK ON HOW TO FORM THE 

[Captioner] 19:22:32
COMMITTEE TO PURSUE THIS WORK.

[Captioner] 19:22:32
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

[Captioner] 19:22:33
I REALLY APPRECIATE IT.

[Captioner] 19:22:42
>> Mayor Mei: IS THAT THE LAST 

[Captioner] 19:22:42
SPEAKER?

[Captioner] 19:22:43
>> Ms. Gauthier: THAT REALLY IS 

[Captioner] 19:22:44
THE LAST SPEAKER.

[Captioner] 19:22:44
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 19:22:46
AT THIS TIME I'D LIKE TO CLOSE 

[Captioner] 19:22:47
ORAL COMMUNICATIONS.

[Captioner] 19:22:49
I JUST WANTED TO MENTION, I 

[Captioner] 19:22:50
THINK WHAT ONE OF THE SPEAKERS 

[Captioner] 19:22:52
IS REFERENCING IS WE HAVE A 

[Captioner] 19:22:52
NOTICE OF FUNDING AVAILABILITY 

[Captioner] 19:22:54
THAT IMKA OUT FROM OUR -- WE'RE 

[Captioner] 19:22:56
DOING A HOMELESSNESS PLAN AND SO 

[Captioner] 19:22:58
THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT I 

[Captioner] 19:23:00
BELIEVE THAT IF APPLICANTS ARE 

[Captioner] 19:23:02
APPLYING FOR THE PROCESS AND I 

[Captioner] 19:23:06
SEE -- I DON'T SEE MR. 

[Captioner] 19:23:08
SCHOENHOLZ HERE, BUT I THINK 

[Captioner] 19:23:09
THERE IS A PROCESS BY WHICH 

[Captioner] 19:23:10
PEOPLE APPEAL OR DISCUSS THOSE 

[Captioner] 19:23:11
RESULTS.

[Captioner] 19:23:13
AND IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT WE 

[Captioner] 19:23:15
TYPICALLY DO HERE, BUT THERE IS 

[Captioner] 19:23:16
A FOLLOW-UP PROCESS AND THANK 

[Captioner] 19:23:17
YOU FOR THE COMMENTS AND WE'LL 

[Captioner] 19:23:18
HAVE OUR STAFF FOLLOW UP.

[Captioner] 19:23:22
AT THIS TIME, I'M GOING TO 

[Captioner] 19:23:28
RETURN TO OUR PULLED ITEM,

[Captioner] 19:23:30
 ITEM 2E, I BELIEVE, CONCERNING 

[Captioner] 19:23:31
OUR SOLID WASTE CONTRACT.

[Captioner] 19:23:33
AND I BELIEVE WE HAVE OUR 

[Captioner] 19:23:35
COMMUNITY SERVICES DIRECTOR, 

[Captioner] 19:23:41
SUZANNE WOLF, AS WELL AS KATHY 

[Captioner] 19:23:42
WHO'S HERE TO ANSWER SOME OF THE 

[Captioner] 19:23:42
QUESTIONS.

[Captioner] 19:23:46
AND AGAIN, THIS IS REGARDING THE 

[Captioner] 19:23:48
SOLID WASTE COLLECTION RATES 

[Captioner] 19:23:50
TRANSFER STATION SERVICE FEES 

[Captioner] 19:23:51
AND LANDFILL DISPOSAL.

[Captioner] 19:23:52
>> Ms. Gauthier: I HAVE ONE 

[Captioner] 19:23:53
SPEAKER CARD.

[Captioner] 19:23:53
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 19:23:55
WE CAN CALL THE SPEAKER ON THAT, 

[Captioner] 19:23:55
PLEASE.

[Captioner] 19:23:58
>> Ms. Gauthier: KELLY ABREU.

[Captioner] 19:24:12
>> THE TITLE OF THIS IS

[Captioner] 19:24:13
 SOLID WASTE TRANSFER FEES BUT 

[Captioner] 19:24:15
ACTUALLY IT FILLED WITH HIDDEN 

[Captioner] 19:24:17
TAXES AND MISLABELED FEES.

[Captioner] 19:24:20
WHAT AM I TALKING ABOUT?

[Captioner] 19:24:21
HIDDEN TAXES?

[Captioner] 19:24:24
WELL, THERE'S SOMETHING CALLED 

[Captioner] 19:24:26
THE INTEGRATED WASTE MANAGEMENT 

[Captioner] 19:24:28
FEE, WHICH THEY TAKE 16%, THE 

[Captioner] 19:24:32
CITY TAKES 16%, TAX IT ON, AND 

[Captioner] 19:24:34
GIVES TO THE MAINTENANCE, CITY 

[Captioner] 19:24:34
MAINTENANCE DEPARTMENT.

[Captioner] 19:24:37
BY THE WAY, NORMALLY THE CITY 

[Captioner] 19:24:37
MAINTENANCE DEPARTMENT GETS A 

[Captioner] 19:24:38
LOT OF THEIR MONEY FROM THE 

[Captioner] 19:24:38
GENERAL FUND.

[Captioner] 19:24:40
SO IT'S JUST THE SAME AS IF YOU 

[Captioner] 19:24:41
GIVE TO THE GENERAL FUND, THEN 

[Captioner] 19:24:42
GIVE TO THE MAINTENANCE 

[Captioner] 19:24:42
DEPARTMENT.

[Captioner] 19:24:45
THE LOGIC THERE IS THAT THEY 

[Captioner] 19:24:46
HAVE TO CLEAN THE STREETS, 

[Captioner] 19:24:49
THERE'S GARBAGE ON THE STREETS.

[Captioner] 19:24:53
THEN THERE'S ANOTHER 10% THAT 

[Captioner] 19:24:54
GOES -- THE CITY TACKS ON, THEY 

[Captioner] 19:24:56
CALL IT THE FRANCHISE FEE.

[Captioner] 19:24:58
AND THE CITY SAYS THE LOGIC 

[Captioner] 19:24:59
THERE IS THAT THAT'S THE VALUE 

[Captioner] 19:25:02
OF USING THE PUBLIC RIGHT-OF-WAY.

[Captioner] 19:25:06
SO 10 PLUS 16, THAT'S LIKE 25% 

[Captioner] 19:25:09
EXTRA FEES RIGHT ON TOP, AND 

[Captioner] 19:25:11
PEOPLE -- WHY IS THAT -- IT'S 

[Captioner] 19:25:12
MISLABELED AS HIDDEN BECAUSE 

[Captioner] 19:25:14
PEOPLE THINK THEY'RE PAYING FOR 

[Captioner] 19:25:14
GARBAGE.

[Captioner] 19:25:15
THEY'RE NOT.

[Captioner] 19:25:16
THEY'RE PAYING FOR THE GENERAL 

[Captioner] 19:25:16
FUND.

[Captioner] 19:25:19
AND FOR THE CITY.

[Captioner] 19:25:20
AND YOU KNOW, IF WE'RE GOING TO 

[Captioner] 19:25:22
BE DOING THIS, HOW ABOUT 

[Captioner] 19:25:23
ELECTRICITY, HAVE YOU EVER 

[Captioner] 19:25:24
THOUGHT ABOUT EBCE?

[Captioner] 19:25:27
WE KEEP TALKING ABOUT HOW 

[Captioner] 19:25:28
ENVIRONMENTAL AND GREEN EBCE 

[Captioner] 19:25:29
IS.

[Captioner] 19:25:30
WELL, WHAT A GREAT OPPORTUNITY.

[Captioner] 19:25:32
HOW ABOUT A FRANCHISE FEE FOR 

[Captioner] 19:25:34
EBCE BECAUSE THEY ARE USING THE 

[Captioner] 19:25:35
VALUABLE PUBLIC RIGHT-OF-WAY, 

[Captioner] 19:25:36
THEY PUT TELEPHONE POLES IN THE 

[Captioner] 19:25:38
MIDDLE OF OUR SIDEWALKS A LOT OF TIMES.

[Captioner] 19:25:42
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE, WHEN THE 

[Captioner] 19:25:45
BICYCLES -- THEY'RE WALKING ON 

[Captioner] 19:25:46
-- THEY'RE RUNNING INTO THESE 

[Captioner] 19:25:46
TELEPHONE POLES.

[Captioner] 19:25:49
AND THEN WHAT ABOUT, YOU KNOW, 

[Captioner] 19:25:51
AN INTEGRATED ELECTRICITY 

[Captioner] 19:25:53
MANAGEMENT FEE BECAUSE THEY HAVE 

[Captioner] 19:25:54
STREETLIGHTS THAT WE HAVE TO PAY 

[Captioner] 19:25:55
TO LIGHT UP THOSE STREETS, WE 

[Captioner] 19:25:58
HAVE TO PAY FOR UNDERGROUND 

[Captioner] 19:25:58
WIRES EVERYWHERE.

[Captioner] 19:26:02
SO THAT WOULD BE A TREMENDOUS 

[Captioner] 19:26:04
OPPORTUNITY TO TACK ON ANOTHER 

[Captioner] 19:26:06
25% OR SO ON TO YOUR ELECTRIC 

[Captioner] 19:26:08
AND GAS, GAS LINES ARE 

[Captioner] 19:26:10
UNDERNEATH THE STREET, THEY BLOW 

[Captioner] 19:26:10
UP SOMETIMES.

[Captioner] 19:26:12
IT'S ALL RIPE FOR THE PICKING.

[Captioner] 19:26:16
AND FOR THIS CITY TO BE OUT HERE 

[Captioner] 19:26:18
JUST, YOU KNOW, TACKING ON FEES 

[Captioner] 19:26:22
ON TO EVERYTHING FOR ANY REASON 

[Captioner] 19:26:29
IS, YOU KNOW, QUITE

[Captioner] 19:26:32
 AVARICIOUS OF YOU.

[Captioner] 19:26:33
THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 19:26:33
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 19:26:37
AND I BELIEVE WE HAD ALSO A 

[Captioner] 19:26:38
COUNCILMEMBER WHO HAD A COMMENT 

[Captioner] 19:26:39
ON THAT.

[Captioner] 19:26:40
I'LL MAKE SOME COMMENTS AFTER 

[Captioner] 19:26:40
YOU.

[Captioner] 19:26:41
COUNCILMEMBER COX.

[Captioner] 19:26:48
>> Councilmember Cox:

[Captioner] 19:26:50
 THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 19:26:52
I APPRECIATE ALL THE HARD WORK 

[Captioner] 19:26:53
THAT WENT INTO DEVELOPING ALL 

[Captioner] 19:26:54
THOSE CHARTS, BECAUSE THAT WAS A 

[Captioner] 19:26:57
LOT OF DETAIL, AND THERE'S A LOT 

[Captioner] 19:26:58
OF THINGS THAT CHANGE FROM YEAR 

[Captioner] 19:27:00
TO YEAR BASED ON THE REGULATORY 

[Captioner] 19:27:05
AND THE STATE AND COUNTY FEES 

[Captioner] 19:27:07
THAT HAPPEN, AND I APPRECIATE 

[Captioner] 19:27:09
THE DETAILED WORK ON THAT.

[Captioner] 19:27:11
ONE OF THE REFERENCES THAT YOU 

[Captioner] 19:27:14
HAD MADE IN THE STAFF REPORT 

[Captioner] 19:27:15
TALKED ABOUT THAT THERE WAS 

[Captioner] 19:27:18
GOING TO BE PREVAILING WAGE 

[Captioner] 19:27:19
ADJUSTMENT THAT WILL BE 

[Captioner] 19:27:21
ADDRESSED IN 2024.

[Captioner] 19:27:23
AND DOING SOME RESEARCH AND 

[Captioner] 19:27:26
LOOKING UP AT THE DEPARTMENT OF 

[Captioner] 19:27:27
INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS WEBSITE AND 

[Captioner] 19:27:30
TALKING WITH OUR COMMUNITY 

[Captioner] 19:27:33
PARTNER LEONA LOCAL 304, THAT 

[Captioner] 19:27:35
THE PREVAILING WAGE IT LOOKS 

[Captioner] 19:27:37
LIKE FOR LABORERS WILL BE 

[Captioner] 19:27:39
EXPIRING IN JUNE 2024, WHICH 

[Captioner] 19:27:41
MAKES SENSE THAT YOU WOULD COME 

[Captioner] 19:27:44
BACK WITH AN UPDATE TO PROVIDE 

[Captioner] 19:27:48
WHAT WOULD BE THE NEW

[Captioner] 19:27:49
 WAGES FOR PREVAILING WAGES.

[Captioner] 19:27:54
THE ONE PART THAT WOULD BEING

[Captioner] 19:27:56
 MOST HELPFUL IN BRINGING BACK 

[Captioner] 19:27:58
THE UPDATED WAGE RATES IS TO BE 

[Captioner] 19:28:01
ABLE TO REFLECT A CHART TO SHOW 

[Captioner] 19:28:04
SOME OF THE WAGE RATES ARE FOR 

[Captioner] 19:28:07
APPRENTICE AND FOR JOURNEYMEN 

[Captioner] 19:28:09
DETERMINATION LEVELS FOR ALAMEDA 

[Captioner] 19:28:11
COUNTY, JUST SO WE'RE ENSURING 

[Captioner] 19:28:13
THAT WE'RE COMPLYING WITH THE 

[Captioner] 19:28:14
CALIFORNIA LABOR CODES THERE.

[Captioner] 19:28:16
SO I APPRECIATE THE HARD WORK 

[Captioner] 19:28:18
AND JUST WANTED TO MENTION THAT 

[Captioner] 19:28:19
IT WOULD BE A LITTLE BIT HELPFUL 

[Captioner] 19:28:22
JUST HAVING THAT EXTRA LITTLE 

[Captioner] 19:28:24
DETAIL TO BE ABLE TO 

[Captioner] 19:28:25
DIFFERENTIATE THAT, BUT ALSO TO 

[Captioner] 19:28:28
SHOW THAT WE'RE BEING 

[Captioner] 19:28:31
TRANSPARENT WITH OUR WAGE RATES 

[Captioner] 19:28:33
FOR THE CITY AS WE WORK WITH OUR 

[Captioner] 19:28:36
DIFFERENT PARTNERS AND ACROSS 

[Captioner] 19:28:37
THE STATE AND COUNTIES.

[Captioner] 19:28:38
SO THANK YOU SO MUCH.

[Captioner] 19:28:47
>> Mayor Mei: COUNCILMEMBER 

[Captioner] 19:28:47
CAMPBELL.

[Captioner] 19:28:48
>> Councilmember Campbell: THANK 

[Captioner] 19:28:50
YOU, COUNCILMEMBER COX, FOR THAT 

[Captioner] 19:28:50
COMMENT.

[Captioner] 19:28:53
BUT I SEEM TO HAVE READ THAT A 

[Captioner] 19:28:58
LITTLE DIFFERENTLY AND TOOK A 

[Captioner] 19:29:02
DIFFERENT APPROACH TO THAT 

[Captioner] 19:29:03
PARTICULAR PREVAILING WAGE 

[Captioner] 19:29:04
ADJUSTMENT CLAUSE THAT YOU HAVE 

[Captioner] 19:29:05
HERE.

[Captioner] 19:29:06
BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT THEY 

[Captioner] 19:29:09
ARE NEGOTIATED WITH THE WASTE 

[Captioner] 19:29:15
MANAGEMENT TEAMSTERS LOCAL AND 

[Captioner] 19:29:16
UNDER THEIR COLLECTIVE 

[Captioner] 19:29:18
BARGAINING AGREEMENT.

[Captioner] 19:29:26
SO THE CITY OF FREMONT, WE DON'T 

[Captioner] 19:29:28
HAVE A REPRESENTATION ON THIS 

[Captioner] 19:29:29
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING TEAM TO BE 

[Captioner] 19:29:31
ABLE TO DETERMINE WHAT THAT RATE 

[Captioner] 19:29:31
WOULD BE.

[Captioner] 19:29:34
WE HAVE TO -- IT'S MORE LIKE A 

[Captioner] 19:29:36
PASS-ON, SO THEY'RE JUST PASSING 

[Captioner] 19:29:37
IT ON BECAUSE THEY AGREE WHAT 

[Captioner] 19:29:38
THE WAGES WOULD LOOK LIKE.

[Captioner] 19:29:42
IS THAT CORRECT

[Captioner] 19:29:42
?

[Captioner] 19:29:43
?

[Captioner] 19:29:47
>> Mayor Mei: IF STAFF COULD 

[Captioner] 19:29:47
CLARIFY.

[Captioner] 19:29:53
SO REPUBLIC SERVICES AS OUR

[Captioner] 19:29:55
 PROVIDER IS REQUIRED TO PAY 

[Captioner] 19:29:55
PREVAILING WAGE.

[Captioner] 19:29:57
THE WAY IT'S INTERPRETED AND 

[Captioner] 19:29:59
APPLIED IN ALAMEDA COUNTY IS 

[Captioner] 19:30:01
THAT THE DRIVERS ARE REPRESENTED 

[Captioner] 19:30:02
BY TEAMSTERS LOCAL 70.

[Captioner] 19:30:05
ALL OF THE SERVICE PROVIDERS 

[Captioner] 19:30:08
WITHIN ALAMEDA COUNTY, WASTE 

[Captioner] 19:30:09
MANAGEMENT, GREEN TEAM, THERE 

[Captioner] 19:30:12
ARE OTHER SERVICE PROVIDERS, ALL 

[Captioner] 19:30:14
OF THOSE DRIVERS ARE REPRESENTED 

[Captioner] 19:30:15
BY LOCAL 70.

[Captioner] 19:30:19
THE CONTRACT THAT HAS THE SINGLE 

[Captioner] 19:30:23
LARGEST CATEGORY OF DRIVER 

[Captioner] 19:30:25
CLASSIFICATIONS, WHETHER IT'S 

[Captioner] 19:30:27
ROLLOFF DRIVERS OR RESIDENTIAL, 

[Captioner] 19:30:28
SO ON, EXCUSE ME, IS WASTE 

[Captioner] 19:30:29
MANAGEMENT.

[Captioner] 19:30:32
SO ESSENTIALLY, WHEN WASTE 

[Captioner] 19:30:35
MANAGEMENT NEGOTIATES THAT 

[Captioner] 19:30:37
CONTRACT WITH THE TEAMSTERS, 

[Captioner] 19:30:40
THAT DETERMINES WAGES, AND THEN 

[Captioner] 19:30:41
THE OTHER SERVICE PROVIDERS 

[Captioner] 19:30:44
ESSENTIALLY NEED TO COMPLY WITH 

[Captioner] 19:30:44
THOSE WAGES.

[Captioner] 19:30:48
SO YES, REPUBLIC SERVICES IS NOT 

[Captioner] 19:30:50
AT THE WASTE MANAGEMENT AND 

[Captioner] 19:30:55
TEAMSTERS TABLE, BUT ESSENTIALLY

[Captioner] 19:30:56
 THOSE PROVISIONS AND WORKING 

[Captioner] 19:30:59
CONDITIONS APPLY TO ESSENTIALLY 

[Captioner] 19:31:00
EVERY SINGLE SOLID WASTE DRIVER 

[Captioner] 19:31:01
THAT OPERATES IN THE COUNTY.

[Captioner] 19:31:04
>> Councilmember Campbell: 

[Captioner] 19:31:05
THAT'S ACTUALLY WHAT I WAS 

[Captioner] 19:31:06
THINKING, I GUESS I JUST DIDN'T 

[Captioner] 19:31:07
SAY IT THAT WAY.

[Captioner] 19:31:09
BECAUSE THOSE WAGES ARE 

[Captioner] 19:31:10
NEGOTIATED AND THEN THEY'RE 

[Captioner] 19:31:12
PASSED ON TO US AND WE JUST HAVE 

[Captioner] 19:31:12
TO PAY THEM.

[Captioner] 19:31:18
ONE QUICK QUESTION ABOUT

[Captioner] 19:31:19
 MR. ABREU WITH THE HIDDEN 

[Captioner] 19:31:19
FEES.

[Captioner] 19:31:24
I'M NOT SURE I UNDERSTOOD THE 

[Captioner] 19:31:26
DIRECTION OF WHERE HE WAS GOING 

[Captioner] 19:31:28
WITH US HAVING TO PASS ON HIDDEN 

[Captioner] 19:31:28
FEES.

[Captioner] 19:31:34
>> SO THE SOLID WASTE RATES ARE 

[Captioner] 19:31:35
COMPRISED OF A COMPONENT 

[Captioner] 19:31:37
COMPENSATION THAT IS RETAINED BY 

[Captioner] 19:31:39
THE SERVICE PROVIDERS, WHETHER 

[Captioner] 19:31:41
THAT'S A TRANSFER STATION 

[Captioner] 19:31:44
LANDFILL OR SOLID WASTE 

[Captioner] 19:31:44
COLLECTOR.

[Captioner] 19:31:45
IN ADDITION, THERE ARE FRANCHISE 

[Captioner] 19:31:47
FEES AND INTEGRATED WASTE 

[Captioner] 19:31:47
MANAGEMENT FEES THAT ARE PART OF 

[Captioner] 19:31:49
THE RATES.

[Captioner] 19:31:51
THE INTEGRATED WASTE MANAGEMENT 

[Captioner] 19:31:53
FEES ARE USED TO FUND ALL THE 

[Captioner] 19:31:54
SOLID WASTE COMPLIANCE 

[Captioner] 19:31:56
ACTIVITIES THAT THE CITY CONDUCTS.

[Captioner] 19:31:58
SO THAT MAY BE -- IT'S THE 

[Captioner] 19:32:00
ENTIRE STAFF, YOU KNOW, THE 

[Captioner] 19:32:01
SOLID WASTE STAFF FOR 

[Captioner] 19:32:03
ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES.

[Captioner] 19:32:07
IT INCLUDES THINGS

[Captioner] 19:32:09
 LIKE ENCAMPMENT ABATEMENT, 

[Captioner] 19:32:12
CLEANING UP MATERIAL THAT IS 

[Captioner] 19:32:13
DISPOSED OF IN PARKS AND 

[Captioner] 19:32:13
INAPPROPRIATELY.

[Captioner] 19:32:17
IT INCLUDES MANAGING -- WE 

[Captioner] 19:32:19
CONSIDER IT SOLID WASTE THAT IS 

[Captioner] 19:32:21
ON THE STREETS OR IN OUR STORM 

[Captioner] 19:32:25
DRAIN SO IT'S STREET SWEEPING, 

[Captioner] 19:32:27
IT'S THOSE ACTIVITIES MAY BE 

[Captioner] 19:32:28
CONDUCTED BY ENVIRONMENTAL 

[Captioner] 19:32:31
SERVICES OR SOME OF THOSE SOLID 

[Captioner] 19:32:32
WASTE ACTIVITIES ARE ACTUALLY 

[Captioner] 19:32:35
CONDUCTED BY OUR MAINTENANCE DEPARTMENT.

[Captioner] 19:32:40
IN ADDITION, A PORTION OF THE 

[Captioner] 19:32:42
SOLID WASTE RATE GO TO -- FOR 

[Captioner] 19:32:44
FRANCHISE FEES GO DIRECTLY TO 

[Captioner] 19:32:46
THE GENERAL FUND.

[Captioner] 19:32:54
>> Councilmember Cox: I DID WANT 

[Captioner] 19:32:55
TO ADD THE DEPARTMENT OF 

[Captioner] 19:32:56
INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS, THEY SET 

[Captioner] 19:32:58
THE RATES THAT EVERYBODY HAS TO 

[Captioner] 19:33:02
FOLLOW, AT LEAST THE AMOUNT FOR 

[Captioner] 19:33:03
PREVAILING WAGE THAT'S ON OUR 

[Captioner] 19:33:04
WEBSITE AND THAT'S GOVERNED BY 

[Captioner] 19:33:06
THE TRADE CODE, THE 

[Captioner] 19:33:07
CLASSIFICATION, AND WHETHER IT'S 

[Captioner] 19:33:10
APPRENTICE OR JOURNEYMAN, BUT 

[Captioner] 19:33:12
IT'S DICTATED THERE WHETHER THEY 

[Captioner] 19:33:13
CLASSIFY AS A LABORER OR HOW YOU 

[Captioner] 19:33:16
WANT TO CLASSIFY IT, BUT JUST 

[Captioner] 19:33:17
MAKING SURE THAT IT'S 

[Captioner] 19:33:19
TRANSPARENT ON WHICH RATES THAT 

[Captioner] 19:33:22
WE'RE USING AND WHICH 

[Captioner] 19:33:26
CLASSIFICATION TO TIE IN BECAUSE 

[Captioner] 19:33:27
THE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL 

[Captioner] 19:33:28
RELATIONS DOES DO NEGOTIATIONS 

[Captioner] 19:33:31
WITH THE COUNTIES AND THEN IT 

[Captioner] 19:33:33
ROLLS UP TO THEIR WEBSITE TO BE 

[Captioner] 19:33:33
PUBLISHED.

[Captioner] 19:33:36
SO JUST WANTED TO ADD A LITTLE 

[Captioner] 19:33:37
CLARIFICATION ON THAT PART 

[Captioner] 19:33:38
THERE, BECAUSE THAT'S THE RULES 

[Captioner] 19:33:40
THAT ARE KIND OF THE MEMO 

[Captioner] 19:33:42
AMOUNT, AND THEN IT GOES ABOVE 

[Captioner] 19:33:44
THAT BASED ON THE NEGOTIATIONS, 

[Captioner] 19:33:45
BUT IT'S A BASELINE.

[Captioner] 19:33:49
 TO MAKE SURE THERE'S NO WAGE 

[Captioner] 19:33:51
THEFT OCCURRING IN ANY OF THESE 

[Captioner] 19:33:51
CONTRACTS.

[Captioner] 19:33:55
SO JUST WANTED TO ADD THAT POINT 

[Captioner] 19:33:55
ON.

[Captioner] 19:33:58
>> Mayor Mei: WELL, LET ME ADD 

[Captioner] 19:33:58
MY COMMENTS ON THIS.

[Captioner] 19:34:01
I KNOW THAT THERE ARE CERTAINLY 

[Captioner] 19:34:04
RULES THAT WE ARE COMPELLED TO, 

[Captioner] 19:34:05
BECAUSE OF OUR LABOR 

[Captioner] 19:34:05
AGREEMENTS.

[Captioner] 19:34:07
AND I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT FOR 

[Captioner] 19:34:10
THE PUBLIC TO BE AWARE IF THERE 

[Captioner] 19:34:12
ARE ADJUSTMENTS THAT WERE REFERENCED.

[Captioner] 19:34:15
WILL THEY CHANGE THE RATES AS 

[Captioner] 19:34:16
THEY APPLY TO THE CONSUMERS, 

[Captioner] 19:34:18
BECAUSE I THINK THE CONSUMERS 

[Captioner] 19:34:18
SOMETIMES DON'T REALIZE THAT 

[Captioner] 19:34:21
THESE ARE RATES THAT ARE RELATED 

[Captioner] 19:34:24
TO LABOR-RELATED INCREASES 

[Captioner] 19:34:25
VERSUS JUST THE DECISION FROM 

[Captioner] 19:34:25
THE CITY.

[Captioner] 19:34:27
SOY WANTED TO CLARIFY THAT, 

[Captioner] 19:34:28
BECAUSE I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT 

[Captioner] 19:34:30
FOR THE PUBLIC TO UNDERSTAND, 

[Captioner] 19:34:31
BECAUSE THERE IS SOME CONFUSION, 

[Captioner] 19:34:34
IT LOOKS LIKE, AS THE RATES 

[Captioner] 19:34:34
INCREASE.

[Captioner] 19:34:36
AND THEN ALSO I THINK IT'S ALSO 

[Captioner] 19:34:36
IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF 

[Captioner] 19:34:39
COMMENTS THAT COME HERE FROM THE 

[Captioner] 19:34:40
PUBLIC REGARDING A COUPLE 

[Captioner] 19:34:40
DIFFERENT THINGS.

[Captioner] 19:34:45
WE HAVE THE WASTE

[Captioner] 19:34:46
 LAWS THAT COME THROUGH FROM THE 

[Captioner] 19:34:48
STATE WHICH REQUIRE US TO HAVE 

[Captioner] 19:34:49
DIFFERENT POLICIES, AND ALSO 

[Captioner] 19:34:51
THESE LAST COUPLE YEARS WITH 

[Captioner] 19:34:52
HOMELESS ENCAMPMENT ABATEMENTS.

[Captioner] 19:34:54
I ROUGHLY REMEMBER THE NUMBER 

[Captioner] 19:34:55
OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD BUT WOULD 

[Captioner] 19:34:57
LOVE TO HEAR IT FROM YOU TO MAKE 

[Captioner] 19:34:58
SURE I'M ACCURATE.

[Captioner] 19:35:00
I BELIEVE IT'S IN THE EXCESS OF 

[Captioner] 19:35:03
SEVERAL TONS, HUNDREDS OF TONS, 

[Captioner] 19:35:05
70 TONS, I THINK, ROUGHLY, IF I 

[Captioner] 19:35:06
REMEMBER CORRECTLY, AND THEN THE 

[Captioner] 19:35:08
FEES WERE SIGNIFICANT COST TO 

[Captioner] 19:35:09
THE CITY, BECAUSE WHEN PEOPLE 

[Captioner] 19:35:12
ARE ASKING US ABOUT ENCAMPMENT 

[Captioner] 19:35:13
ABATEMENT AND OTHER THINGS, 

[Captioner] 19:35:14
THOSE HAVE TREMENDOUSLY 

[Captioner] 19:35:15
INCREASED OVER THE LAST COUPLE 

[Captioner] 19:35:16
YEARS, AND THAT'S WHY HE WITH 

[Captioner] 19:35:17
NEED THE PARTNERSHIP.

[Captioner] 19:35:18
SO IF YOU WANT TO REFERENCE 

[Captioner] 19:35:19
THOSE SPECIFICALLY, I DON'T KNOW 

[Captioner] 19:35:21
IF YOU HAVE THOSE NUMBER, I 

[Captioner] 19:35:23
APOLOGIZE, YOU MAY NOT HAVE THEM 

[Captioner] 19:35:24
WITH YOU AT THIS MOMENT, BUT I 

[Captioner] 19:35:25
DO RECALL IT'S IN EXCESS OF 

[Captioner] 19:35:28
ROUGHLY ABOUT 70-TON, I THINK, 

[Captioner] 19:35:28
OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD.

[Captioner] 19:35:31
SORRY.

[Captioner] 19:35:35
>> THE ABATEMENT COST PER YEAR 

[Captioner] 19:35:38
IS PROBABLY ABOUT 550 TO 

[Captioner] 19:35:41
600,000, JUST TO REMOVE THE 

[Captioner] 19:35:42
WASTE, FOR THE CONTRACTOR LABOR 

[Captioner] 19:35:43
AND THE DISPOSAL.

[Captioner] 19:35:45
AND DISMANTLING OF BURNED OUT 

[Captioner] 19:35:47
RVs AND OTHER THINGS THAT WE 

[Captioner] 19:35:48
HAVE TO DEAL WITH.

[Captioner] 19:35:50
>> Mayor Mei: AND ACTUALLY THE 

[Captioner] 19:35:50
COSTS COULD BE GREATER, BECAUSE 

[Captioner] 19:35:53
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT RVs, THAT'S 

[Captioner] 19:35:54
ANOTHER DISCUSSION I KNOW WILL 

[Captioner] 19:35:56
BE COMING BACK TO US, WAS 

[Captioner] 19:35:58
SPECIFICALLY ABOUT EACH TIME 

[Captioner] 19:36:00
THOSE ARE REMOVED THERE'S A 

[Captioner] 19:36:01
SIGNIFICANT COST FOR EACH OF 

[Captioner] 19:36:02
THOSE, IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY.

[Captioner] 19:36:03
>> CORRECT.

[Captioner] 19:36:05
AND IT REQUIRES SPECIALIZED 

[Captioner] 19:36:06
EQUIPMENT BECAUSE THEY 

[Captioner] 19:36:07
ESSENTIALLY NEED TO BE 

[Captioner] 19:36:08
DISMANTLED.

[Captioner] 19:36:09
>> Mayor Mei: DO WE HAVE A ROUGH 

[Captioner] 19:36:10
ESTIMATE OR DO YOU HAVE ANY 

[Captioner] 19:36:11
GUESSTIMATE IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH 

[Captioner] 19:36:13
IT IS PER VEHICLE THAT'S 

[Captioner] 19:36:14
INOPERABLE?

[Captioner] 19:36:16
BECAUSE WE HAVE QUITE A FEW THAT 

[Captioner] 19:36:18
ARE INOPERABLE.

[Captioner] 19:36:20
>> Ms. Wolf: MAYOR, WE CAN 

[Captioner] 19:36:20
PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION TO YOU 

[Captioner] 19:36:22
AND PROVIDE THE TONNAGE AS WELL 

[Captioner] 19:36:23
AND PROVIDE THAT TO THE MAYOR 

[Captioner] 19:36:23
AND COUNCIL TOGETHER.

[Captioner] 19:36:24
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY.

[Captioner] 19:36:28
AND THEN AS OUR COUNCILMEMBER 

[Captioner] 19:36:29
HAD MENTIONED THAT THE INCREASE 

[Captioner] 19:36:33
OF WAGES WOULD POTENTIALLY 

[Captioner] 19:36:34
CHANGE THIS CHART THEN, BECAUSE 

[Captioner] 19:36:35
THOSE COSTS WOULD BE INCURRED BY 

[Captioner] 19:36:36
THE CITY.

[Captioner] 19:36:38
SO HOW MUCH INCREASE WOULD THAT 

[Captioner] 19:36:40
BE, OR WILL WE BE DOING AN 

[Captioner] 19:36:44
UPDATE AT THAT TIME, IN JULY, 

[Captioner] 19:36:47
I'M ASSUMING, END OF JUNE?

[Captioner] 19:36:50
>> THE DRIVER WAGES ARE IN THE 

[Captioner] 19:36:50
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT, 

[Captioner] 19:36:53
WHICH IS GOING TO BE IN EFFECT 

[Captioner] 19:36:55
THROUGH JUNE OF 2025.

[Captioner] 19:36:58
SO THE RATES THAT HAVE BEEN 

[Captioner] 19:37:00
PRESENTED TO THE COUNCIL ARE 

[Captioner] 19:37:04
GOING TO BE ADEQUATE TO COVER 

[Captioner] 19:37:06
LABOR THROUGH THE CURRENT 

[Captioner] 19:37:07
RATE-SETTING CYCLE, WHICH GOES 

[Captioner] 19:37:08
THROUGH DECEMBER OF 2025.

[Captioner] 19:37:13
SO THOSE INCREASES, INCREASED 

[Captioner] 19:37:17
WAGES WENT INTO EFFECT JULY 1ST

[Captioner] 19:37:19
 OF 2022.

[Captioner] 19:37:23
SO THE IMPACT FROM JULY OF 2022 

[Captioner] 19:37:27
THROUGH DECEMBER OF 2023, KIND 

[Captioner] 19:37:29
OF WHAT WE CONSIDER THE 

[Captioner] 19:37:30
RETROACTIVE PIECE, WE NEED TO 

[Captioner] 19:37:31
DEAL WITH SEPARATELY AS A LUMP 

[Captioner] 19:37:31
SUM PAYMENT.

[Captioner] 19:37:35
SO I'LL BE COMING BACK TO THE 

[Captioner] 19:37:36
COUNCIL WITH A RECOMMENDATION 

[Captioner] 19:37:39
HOW TO ADDRESS THAT COMPONENT OF 

[Captioner] 19:37:39
IT.

[Captioner] 19:37:43
THE COST THAT'S ASSOCIATED, THE 

[Captioner] 19:37:47
LABOR COST THAT IS

[Captioner] 19:37:48
 JANUARY 2024 ON HAS BEEN 

[Captioner] 19:37:49
INCORPORATED INTO THE RATES AND 

[Captioner] 19:37:51
WE ANTICIPATE WILL BE ADEQUATE.

[Captioner] 19:37:55
SO THERE WOULD BE NO ANTICIPATED 

[Captioner] 19:37:56
ADDITIONAL ADJUSTMENTS TO SOLID 

[Captioner] 19:37:57
WASTE RATES FOR THE CONSUMER.

[Captioner] 19:38:00
>> Mayor Mei: THAT'S GOOD TO 

[Captioner] 19:38:00
KNOW.

[Captioner] 19:38:02
IT SOUNDS LIKE UNFORTUNATELY 

[Captioner] 19:38:04
THERE'S SOMETHING THAT'S 

[Captioner] 19:38:04
RETROACTIVE THAT WE ARE 

[Captioner] 19:38:06
COMPELLED TO, IT SOUNDS LIKE 

[Captioner] 19:38:07
WE'VE ALREADY -- YOU'RE SAYING 

[Captioner] 19:38:09
THAT FROM JULY OF 2022 TO 

[Captioner] 19:38:12
DECEMBER OF 2023, WE'RE GETTING 

[Captioner] 19:38:15
APPLIED A RATE RETROACTIVELY FOR 

[Captioner] 19:38:16
THE INCREASE OF WAGES?

[Captioner] 19:38:20
>> REPUBLIC SERVICES WAS 

[Captioner] 19:38:22
REQUIRED TO PAY THESE WAGES TO 

[Captioner] 19:38:24
THEIR DRIVERS BECAUSE THEY WERE 

[Captioner] 19:38:25
PREVAILING, BUT WE DID NOT WANT 

[Captioner] 19:38:29
TO DO A MID CYCLE RATE 

[Captioner] 19:38:29
ADJUSTMENT.

[Captioner] 19:38:33
SO WE SAID WE'RE GOING TO 

[Captioner] 19:38:36
INCORPORATE THAT -- RECOMMEND 

[Captioner] 19:38:37
INCORPORATING THOSE LABOR RATES 

[Captioner] 19:38:39
INTO THE RATES THAT GET SET 

[Captioner] 19:38:42
STARTING JANUARY 2024, AND THEN 

[Captioner] 19:38:44
WE WILL LOOK AT THE PIECE THAT 

[Captioner] 19:38:45
OCCURRED PRIOR TO THAT IN THE 

[Captioner] 19:38:48
MIDDLE OF THE RATE CYCLE AND WE 

[Captioner] 19:38:48
WILL COMPENSATE SEPARATELY.

[Captioner] 19:38:54
WE HAVE A FUND BALANCE FOR THESE

[Captioner] 19:38:55
 ONE-TIME EXPENSES.

[Captioner] 19:38:59
IT'S COLLECTED EXPRESSLY FOR 

[Captioner] 19:39:00
THAT PURPOSE FOR THIS INTERIM.

[Captioner] 19:39:02
ONE OF THE THINGS THE CITY HAS 

[Captioner] 19:39:03
STRIVED TO DO IS WHEN WE SET 

[Captioner] 19:39:04
RATES, WE WANT TO KEEP THEM 

[Captioner] 19:39:06
STABLE FOR A TWO-YEAR PERIOD AND 

[Captioner] 19:39:09
NOT BE DOING FREQUENT RATE ADJUSTMENTS.

[Captioner] 19:39:13
>> Mayor Mei: NO, I DEFINITELY 

[Captioner] 19:39:14
UNDERSTAND THAT, AND CERTAINLY 

[Captioner] 19:39:15
THESE LAST COUPLE YEARS, FROM 

[Captioner] 19:39:17
THE CONSUMER PERSPECTIVE AND THE 

[Captioner] 19:39:19
COMMUNITY PERSPECTIVE, WHETHER 

[Captioner] 19:39:20
IT'S OUR SMALL BUSINESSES WHICH 

[Captioner] 19:39:22
WE JUST HONORED, AS WELL AS FOR 

[Captioner] 19:39:24
THE CONSUMERS, IT'S VERY 

[Captioner] 19:39:27
DIFFICULT TO RUN A BUSINESS NOT 

[Captioner] 19:39:28
KNOWING THAT YOUR FEES AND 

[Captioner] 19:39:30
HAVING IT VARIABLE, DEPENDING ON 

[Captioner] 19:39:30
NEGOTIATIONS.

[Captioner] 19:39:31
SO I THINK THAT FOR THE 

[Captioner] 19:39:33
STABILITY OF OUR SMALL 

[Captioner] 19:39:34
BUSINESSES AND THE CONSUMERS 

[Captioner] 19:39:35
THEMSELVES, ESPECIALLY THOSE ON 

[Captioner] 19:39:37
FIXED INCOME, I THINK THAT THEY 

[Captioner] 19:39:39
WOULD LIKE TO KNOW THAT IT'S 

[Captioner] 19:39:41
BEING STABLE.

[Captioner] 19:39:43
SO I WILL LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR 

[Captioner] 19:39:45
ADDITIONAL AGENDA ITEM BUT I 

[Captioner] 19:39:46
THINK AT THAT TIME IT WOULD BE 

[Captioner] 19:39:48
GOOD TO CLARIFY THAT RATE IS NOT 

[Captioner] 19:39:50
BEING DETERMINED BY THE CITY AS 

[Captioner] 19:39:51
AN INCREASE, BUT RATHER A 

[Captioner] 19:39:54
REFLECTION OF US COMPLYING WITH 

[Captioner] 19:39:57
THE PREVAILING WAGE THAT WAS 

[Captioner] 19:39:58
RETROACTIVELY APPLIED, I THINK 

[Captioner] 19:39:59
IT SOUNDS LIKE FROM THAT TIME 

[Captioner] 19:40:00
PERIOD SO THAT PEOPLE UNDERSTAND 

[Captioner] 19:40:00
THE FEES.

[Captioner] 19:40:05
AND SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT.

[Captioner] 19:40:07
I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND, WE WANT 

[Captioner] 19:40:08
TO TREAT OUR EMPLOYEES WELL, BUT 

[Captioner] 19:40:10
I THINK OUR SMALL BUSINESSES, SO 

[Captioner] 19:40:12
MANY WHICH HAVE CLOSED DURING 

[Captioner] 19:40:14
THIS PANDEMIC AS WELL AS OUR 

[Captioner] 19:40:16
RESIDENTS, ESPECIALLY THOSE 

[Captioner] 19:40:17
SENIORS WHO ARE STRUGGLING ALSO 

[Captioner] 19:40:19
WOULD LIKE TO SO STABILITY.

[Captioner] 19:40:21
I THINK FROM THE CONSUMER'S 

[Captioner] 19:40:22
PERSPECTIVE, I THINK IT'S 

[Captioner] 19:40:22
IMPORTANT.

[Captioner] 19:40:24
SO THAT BEING SAID, DO WE HAVE A 

[Captioner] 19:40:25
MOTION ON THIS ITEM?

[Captioner] 19:40:28
>> Councilmember Cox: YES.

[Captioner] 19:40:29
>> Mayor Mei: COUNCILMEMBER 

[Captioner] 19:40:31
SALWAN, I SEE YOU MOVE IT, 

[Captioner] 19:40:32
SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER COX.

[Captioner] 19:40:33
>> Ms. Gauthier: THIS WOULD 

[Captioner] 19:40:36
INCLUDE THE ADJUSTMENT OF THE 

[Captioner] 19:40:37
GREEN SHEET THAT YOU ALL 

[Captioner] 19:40:38
RECEIVED AND THAT WAS POSTED 

[Captioner] 19:40:39

[Captioner] 19:40:41
>> Mayor Mei: YES.

[Captioner] 19:40:45
OKAY.

[Captioner] 19:40:54
THE ITEM PASSES UNANIMOUSLY WITH 

[Captioner] 19:40:57

[Captioner] 19:41:44
I JUST HAVE A BRIEF OVERVIEW ON 

[Captioner] 19:41:44
ITEM 5A.

[Captioner] 19:41:50
THE PURPOSE OF THIS AGENDA ITEM

THEN RESTORING THE STREET 

[Captioner] 19:42:10
AFTERWARDS TO A GOOD CONDITION.

[Captioner] 19:42:12
THIS WORK IS TYPICALLY PERFORMED 

[Captioner] 19:42:14

TO ALIGN WITH CURRENT STAFF WORK 

[Captioner] 19:42:32
EFFORTS AND LABOR COSTS 

[Captioner] 19:42:33
CONSISTENT WITH THE CITY'S COST 

[Captioner] 19:42:34
RECOVERY POLICIES.

[Captioner] 19:42:37
AS NOTED THIS ACTION REQUIRES 

[Captioner] 19:42:39
THAT THE CITY COUNCIL FIRST HOLD

A PUBLIC HEARING.

[Captioner] 19:42:44
THIS CONCLUDES MY OVERVIEW TO

[Captioner] 19:43:27
ANNUAL REPORT.

[Captioner] 19:43:31
ALSO THAT WILL BE OUR PUBLIC 

[Captioner] 19:43:35
WORKS DIRECTOR HANS LARSEN TO 

[Captioner] 19:43:36
PROVIDE A BRIEF OVERVIEW ON THIS 

[Captioner] 19:43:37
ITEM AND TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS 

[Captioner] 19:43:38
AT THIS TIME.

[Captioner] 19:43:41
>> Mr. Larsen: AGAIN THANK YOU, 

[Captioner] 19:43:42
MAYOR MEI, MEMBERS OF THE 

[Captioner] 19:43:42
COUNCIL.

[Captioner] 19:43:45
THE PURPOSE OF THIS AGENDA ITEM 

[Captioner] 19:43:47
IS TO RECEIVE AND APPROVE AN 

[Captioner] 19:43:48
ANNUAL REPORT ON THE CITY'S 

[Captioner] 19:43:49
COLLECTION AND USE OF 

[Captioner] 19:43:50
DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEES.

[Captioner] 19:43:52
THIS IS A ROUTINE ANNUAL ACTION 

[Captioner] 19:43:54
THAT'S REQUIRED BY STATE LAW.

[Captioner] 19:43:58
THE OTHER RELATED ITEM IS A 

[Captioner] 19:44:00
ROUTINE ANNUAL ACTION FOR THE 

[Captioner] 19:44:03
CITY TO ADJUST ITS DEVELOPMENT 

[Captioner] 19:44:06
IMPACT FEES BASED ON THE BAY 

[Captioner] 19:44:09
AREA'S CONSTRUCTION COST INDEX.

[Captioner] 19:44:10
IT'S INTERESTING TO NOTE THAT 

[Captioner] 19:44:15
THIS YEAR THEY ARE REPORTING A

[Captioner] 19:44:18
 1.72% REDUCTION IN CONSTRUCTION 

[Captioner] 19:44:19
COSTS WHICH WE CONSIDER TO BE A 

[Captioner] 19:44:22
MARKET CORRECTION TO WHAT WAS 

[Captioner] 19:44:26
LAST YEAR A RELATIVELY HIGH

[Captioner] 19:44:28
 INCREASE IN THE INFLATIONARY 

[Captioner] 19:44:30
VALUE, WHICH WAS 13.65%.

[Captioner] 19:44:33
AGAIN, THIS ACTION ALSO REQUIRES 

[Captioner] 19:44:35
THAT THE COUNCIL HOLD A PUBLIC 

[Captioner] 19:44:35
HEARING.

[Captioner] 19:44:38
THAT CONCLUDES MY OVERVIEW.

[Captioner] 19:44:39
I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY 

[Captioner] 19:44:39
QUESTIONS.

[Captioner] 19:44:40
THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 19:44:44
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 19:44:45
ARE THERE ANY CLARIFYING 

[Captioner] 19:44:46
QUESTIONS FROM THE COUNCIL?

[Captioner] 19:44:48
ARE THERE ANY PUBLIC SPEAKERS ON 

[Captioner] 19:44:48
THIS ITEM?

[Captioner] 19:44:49
AND I BELIEVE --

[Captioner] 19:44:50
>> Ms. Gauthier: ONE.

[Captioner] 19:44:50
KELLY ABREU.

[Captioner] 19:44:54
>> Mayor Mei: WELCOME, MR. 

[Captioner] 19:44:54
ABREU.

[Captioner] 19:45:04
>> LAST YEAR, THIS CITY SAW A

[Captioner] 19:45:09
 13% INCREASE IN THE BAY AREA 

[Captioner] 19:45:11
CONSTRUCTION COST INDEX, AND WAS 

[Captioner] 19:45:13
ONLY TOO HAPPY TO JUMP IN TO 

[Captioner] 19:45:15
PILE ON, TO GRAB ON TO THAT AND 

[Captioner] 19:45:16
SAY, WELL, WE'RE GOING TO USE 

[Captioner] 19:45:16
THAT INDEX.

[Captioner] 19:45:22
AND YOU KNOW, IF YOU'RE GOING TO 

[Captioner] 19:45:23
BE TAXING DEVELOPERS, HOW ABOUT 

[Captioner] 19:45:27
IF YOU WERE -- WITH A 

[Captioner] 19:45:28
CONSTRUCTION COST INDEX, HOW 

[Captioner] 19:45:29
ABOUT IF YOU TAX MANUFACTURERS 

[Captioner] 19:45:33
WITH THE CAR MANUFACTURING COST 

[Captioner] 19:45:33
INDEX?

[Captioner] 19:45:35
A MODEST PROPOSAL HERE, YOU 

[Captioner] 19:45:38
KNOW, BECAUSE YOU THINK -- THIS 

[Captioner] 19:45:40
CITY THINKS THAT IT DESERVES TO 

[Captioner] 19:45:42
USE THE SAME COST INDEX AS THE 

[Captioner] 19:45:43
PEOPLE THAT ARE PAYING THE 

[Captioner] 19:45:43
TAXES.

[Captioner] 19:45:45
IF IT COSTS MORE OR LESS TO 

[Captioner] 19:45:47
MANUFACTURE CARS, MAYBE YOU 

[Captioner] 19:45:50
SHOULD, YOU KNOW, GO WITH THAT 

[Captioner] 19:45:50
ONE.

[Captioner] 19:45:52
OF COURSE IT MAKES NO SENSE 

[Captioner] 19:45:54
BECAUSE FIRE FACILITIES, A MAJOR 

[Captioner] 19:45:55
COST OF FIRE IS LABOR.

[Captioner] 19:45:58
IT'S NOT FIRE BUILDINGS.

[Captioner] 19:45:59
PARK FACILITIES, SAME THING.

[Captioner] 19:46:01
THESE PEOPLE COST MONEY, THE 

[Captioner] 19:46:06
PARK RANGERS, PARKLAND, THAT'S A 

[Captioner] 19:46:10
LAND COST, AND TRAFFIC PROGRAMS 

[Captioner] 19:46:10
THAT'S THE TRAFFIC ENGINEERS.

[Captioner] 19:46:14
ALL OF THIS IS HEAVY LABOR 

[Captioner] 19:46:14
COMPONENTS.

[Captioner] 19:46:16
YOU ARE NOT OUT THERE DOING CITY 

[Captioner] 19:46:16
CONSTRUCTION ALL THE TIME.

[Captioner] 19:46:18
THIS CITY IS NOT A MAJOR 

[Captioner] 19:46:21
CONSTRUCTION OPERATOR OR 

[Captioner] 19:46:21
SPONSOR.

[Captioner] 19:46:25
CITY COSTS ARE LARGELY TIED TO 

[Captioner] 19:46:26
HUGE LABOR CONTRACTS.

[Captioner] 19:46:29
THE VAST MAJORITY OF THIS CITY 

[Captioner] 19:46:29
SPENDING IS ON LABOR.

[Captioner] 19:46:32
AND HERE YOU ARE, OH, WE'RE 

[Captioner] 19:46:34
GOING TO GO WITH A CONSTRUCTION 

[Captioner] 19:46:36
COST INDEX.

[Captioner] 19:46:36
AND WHAT HAPPENED?

[Captioner] 19:46:38
IT BACKFIRED.

[Captioner] 19:46:38
2% DOWN.

[Captioner] 19:46:42
1.7% DOWN THIS YEAR.

[Captioner] 19:46:43
HIGHLY VOLATILE, RIGHT?

[Captioner] 19:46:48
KIND OF LIKE THOSE NEW AUTO 

[Captioner] 19:46:49
SALES, TAX REVENUES?

[Captioner] 19:46:49
HIGH VOLATILITY.

[Captioner] 19:46:51
IN THIS CASE IT BACKFIRED.

[Captioner] 19:46:53
I DON'T THINK THAT THIS 

[Captioner] 19:46:54
DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEE SHOULD 

[Captioner] 19:46:55
HAVE BEEN TIED TO THAT.

[Captioner] 19:46:56
IT JUST MAKES NO SENSE.

[Captioner] 19:46:58
BECAUSE YOU HAVE NOTHING TO DO 

[Captioner] 19:46:59
-- YOU'RE NOT DOING 

[Captioner] 19:46:59
CONSTRUCTION.

[Captioner] 19:47:00
THEY ARE.

[Captioner] 19:47:01
YOU'RE NOT.

[Captioner] 19:47:03
YOUR TAXES SHOULD NOT BE TIED TO 

[Captioner] 19:47:05
THIS KIND OF A THING, BUT IT WAS 

[Captioner] 19:47:09
A SHINY TRINKET, IT WAS THESE 

[Captioner] 19:47:11
SHINY LITTLE BRAND NEW DOLLAR 

[Captioner] 19:47:13
BILLS OUT THERE, THE 13.65% WAS 

[Captioner] 19:47:16
VERY ATTRACTIVE, AND YOU JUST 

[Captioner] 19:47:19
SAID, YOU KNOW, LET'S USE THAT 

[Captioner] 19:47:19
INDEX.

[Captioner] 19:47:23
WELL, IT WAS THE WRONG INDEX, 

[Captioner] 19:47:24
HAD NO THEORETICAL BASIS AND 

[Captioner] 19:47:25
IT'S NOW BACKFIRING.

[Captioner] 19:47:26
THANKS.

[Captioner] 19:47:29
>> Mayor Mei: COUNCILMEMBER 

[Captioner] 19:47:29
SALWAN, DO YOU HAVE COMMENTS?

[Captioner] 19:47:31
I HAVE SOME COMMENTS TO ADD.

[Captioner] 19:47:35
>> Councilmember Salwan: YEAH, 

[Captioner] 19:47:37
SO HE RAISES AN INTERESTING 

[Captioner] 19:47:37
POINT.

[Captioner] 19:47:39
DO WE HAVE DISCRETION ON WHICH 

[Captioner] 19:47:41
INDEX TO USE OR IS THIS KIND OF 

[Captioner] 19:47:42
THE STANDARD INDEX?

[Captioner] 19:47:44
>> Mr. Larsen: THIS IS THE 

[Captioner] 19:47:45
TYPICAL STANDARD USED FOR -- 

[Captioner] 19:47:46
JUST TO CLARIFY ON THE COMMENTS 

[Captioner] 19:47:48
MADE, SO THE PURPOSE OF OUR 

[Captioner] 19:47:50
DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEES IS TO 

[Captioner] 19:47:53
SUPPORT THE ACTUAL CONSTRUCTION 

[Captioner] 19:47:55
OF CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT, SO THAT 

[Captioner] 19:47:56
RELATES TO STREETS, IT RELATES 

[Captioner] 19:48:00
TO BUILDINGS, IT RELATES TO PARK 

[Captioner] 19:48:02
IMPROVEMENTS, AND IT IS TYPICAL 

[Captioner] 19:48:05
PRACTICE FOR CITIES TO HAVE AN 

[Captioner] 19:48:08
INFLATIONARY ADJUSTMENT FACTOR, 

[Captioner] 19:48:10
AND WE SET ONE, AND THIS HAS 

[Captioner] 19:48:12
BEEN A STANDARD PRACTICE THAT WE 

[Captioner] 19:48:16
SET IT BASED ON THE CONSTRUCTION

[Captioner] 19:48:18
 COST OF THE TYPES OF THINGS 

[Captioner] 19:48:18
THAT WE'RE BUILDING.

[Captioner] 19:48:21
SO WE USED THE CONSTRUCTION COST 

[Captioner] 19:48:24
INDEX, WHICH IS SORT OF HEAVILY 

[Captioner] 19:48:26
ASSOCIATED WITH CONCRETE AND 

[Captioner] 19:48:28
ASPHALT AND THINGS RELATED TO 

[Captioner] 19:48:28
INFRASTRUCTURE.

[Captioner] 19:48:32
WE DID NOTE IN THE STAFF REPORT 

[Captioner] 19:48:34
THAT THERE ARE DIFFERENT TYPES 

[Captioner] 19:48:37
OF INDEXES, SO WE'RE NOT 

[Captioner] 19:48:38
TYPICALLY DOING NEW DEVELOPMENT 

[Captioner] 19:48:41
AND BUILDING CONSTRUCTION, SO 

[Captioner] 19:48:42
THOSE HAVE SOME DIFFERENT RATES, 

[Captioner] 19:48:44
AND THEN THE CONSUMER PRICE 

[Captioner] 19:48:44
INDEX.

[Captioner] 19:48:47
SO THE COST OF FOODS AND GOODS 

[Captioner] 19:48:47
IS DIFFERENT.

[Captioner] 19:48:51
SO THE ONE THAT WE USE IS THE 

[Captioner] 19:48:52
ONE THAT IS MOST ALIGNED WITH 

[Captioner] 19:48:53
THE TYPE OF WORK THAT WE'RE 

[Captioner] 19:48:57
DOING, THAT'S BEEN OUR PAST 

[Captioner] 19:48:57
PRACTICE.

[Captioner] 19:48:59
IT TYPICALLY INCREASES AND IF 

[Captioner] 19:49:02
YOU LOOK AT A 20-YEAR HISTORY, 

[Captioner] 19:49:07
IT GENERALLY HAS ADJUSTED

[Captioner] 19:49:10
 2, 3, 4% BUT WE HAVE SEEN SOME 

[Captioner] 19:49:12
QUITE UNUSUAL INCREASES IN THE 

[Captioner] 19:49:12
LAST TWO YEARS.

[Captioner] 19:49:14
LAST YEAR WAS THE HIGHEST ON 

[Captioner] 19:49:17
RECORD THAT WE'VE HAD, AND SO IT 

[Captioner] 19:49:18
NOT TOO SURPRISING THAT THIS 

[Captioner] 19:49:21
YEAR IS REALLY KIND OF A MARKET 

[Captioner] 19:49:21
REDUCTION.

[Captioner] 19:49:24
OUR EXPECTATION IS THAT NEXT 

[Captioner] 19:49:27
YEAR, WE'LL BE LOOKING AT A 

[Captioner] 19:49:28
MODEST INCREASE, AND THAT'S WHAT 

[Captioner] 19:49:29
WE'RE EXPERIENCING WITH SOME OF 

[Captioner] 19:49:31
THE PROJECTS THAT WE'RE BIDDING 

[Captioner] 19:49:31
OUT TODAY.

[Captioner] 19:49:33
>> Councilmember Salwan: THANK 

[Captioner] 19:49:34
YOU FOR THAT CLARIFICATION.

[Captioner] 19:49:37
IT'S ACTUALLY SURPRISING, IT 

[Captioner] 19:49:39
NEVER COMES DOWN, THESE IMPACT 

[Captioner] 19:49:40
FEES, SO THAT'S, I GUESS, ONE 

[Captioner] 19:49:40
SURPRISING THING.

[Captioner] 19:49:42
BUT THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 19:49:43
I'M READY TO MOVE THIS FORWARD 

[Captioner] 19:49:44
AFTER THE COMMENTS.

[Captioner] 19:49:45
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 19:49:47
MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN.

[Captioner] 19:49:49
SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER COX.

[Captioner] 19:49:50
AND COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL, DID 

[Captioner] 19:49:52
YOU HAVE A COMMENT?

[Captioner] 19:49:53
>> Councilmember Campbell: I 

[Captioner] 19:49:54
THINK I HAD A QUESTION.

[Captioner] 19:49:59
BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SORT 

[Captioner] 19:50:01
OF LIKE A MARKET CORRECTION, BUT 

[Captioner] 19:50:05
DIDN'T WE SEE AN INCREASE IN THE 

[Captioner] 19:50:08
COST OF DEVELOPMENT FOR 

[Captioner] 19:50:09
CONSTRUCTION OVER THE LAST 

[Captioner] 19:50:12
COUPLE OF YEARS, PARTICULARLY 

[Captioner] 19:50:16
WITH THE COVID AND NOT BEING 

[Captioner] 19:50:18
ABLE TO GET CONCRETE AND STEEL 

[Captioner] 19:50:20
AND ALL OF THE OTHER MATERIALS 

[Captioner] 19:50:22
THAT WE NEEDED, LABOR COSTS, NOT 

[Captioner] 19:50:25
BEING ABLE TO GET LABOR SO THAT 

[Captioner] 19:50:28
INCREASED THE COST OF 

[Captioner] 19:50:28
CONSTRUCTION?

[Captioner] 19:50:33
AND THEN ON THE FEE REPORT,

[Captioner] 19:50:37
 IT SHOWS THAT THE FEES ARE 

[Captioner] 19:50:40
GOING UP, BUT THE INDEX IS GOING 

[Captioner] 19:50:40
DOWN.

[Captioner] 19:50:42
I DON'T -- I'M NOT DRAWING THE 

[Captioner] 19:50:45
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THOSE THREE 

[Captioner] 19:50:45
THINGS.

[Captioner] 19:50:49
>> Mr. Larsen: I WOULD SAY WE'RE 

[Captioner] 19:50:51
KIND OF IN A -- KIND OF AN 

[Captioner] 19:50:54
INTERESTING OR UNSTABLE KIND OF 

[Captioner] 19:50:55
SITUATION IN TERMS OF COST, AND 

[Captioner] 19:50:58
IF YOU LOOK AT THE COST, THE 

[Captioner] 19:50:59
CONSTRUCTION COST INDEX, IF YOU 

[Captioner] 19:51:03
GO BACK 2020, IT WAS ABOUT 4 

[Captioner] 19:51:08
1/2%, THEN IT WENT UP TO 6.6 AND

[Captioner] 19:51:10
 THEN LAST YEAR IT JUMPED TO 

[Captioner] 19:51:12
13.65, AND COUNCIL MAY RECALL, I 

[Captioner] 19:51:14
MEAN, YOU KNOW, THERE WAS SOME 

[Captioner] 19:51:17
CONCERN, AND INPUT FROM THE 

[Captioner] 19:51:19
BUILDING INDUSTRY ABOUT THAT, 

[Captioner] 19:51:22
THAT RATE, AND WE DECIDED TO USE 

[Captioner] 19:51:28
IT BECAUSE THAT IS

[Captioner] 19:51:32
 WHAT THE REALITY OF THE 

[Captioner] 19:51:33
CONSTRUCTION COST HAD GONE UP 

[Captioner] 19:51:35
THAT MUCH AND WE STUCK WITH SORT 

[Captioner] 19:51:40
OF WHAT IS THAT REPUTABLE SOURCE 

[Captioner] 19:51:41
OF COST WITHIN THE BAY AREA.

[Captioner] 19:51:43
SO, I MEAN, IT IS -- THIS IS THE 

[Captioner] 19:51:45
FIRST YEAR IT'S GONE DOWN.

[Captioner] 19:51:48
I THINK AS STAFF, WE LOOKED AT, 

[Captioner] 19:51:51
WOW, THIS IS UNUSUAL, SHOULD WE 

[Captioner] 19:51:52
DO THAT, BUT I THINK IN LIGHT OF 

[Captioner] 19:51:54
THE FACT THAT LAST YEAR WAS SO 

[Captioner] 19:51:58
HIGH, IT DOES SORT OF FEEL LIKE

[Captioner] 19:51:59
 THERE ARE SOME ADJUSTMENTS THAT 

[Captioner] 19:52:02
ARE BEING MADE IN THE MARKET, 

[Captioner] 19:52:03
PARTICULARLY FOR SOME OF THE 

[Captioner] 19:52:04
THINGS THAT WE'RE PAYING FOR 

[Captioner] 19:52:06
THAT WE WOULD DO WITH OUR 

[Captioner] 19:52:06
CAPITAL PROGRAM.

[Captioner] 19:52:11
THE LAST ITEM, THERE WAS AN 

[Captioner] 19:52:13
INCREASE IN OUR FEES, WHICH IS 

[Captioner] 19:52:17
ASSOCIATED WITH CITY STAFF LABOR 

[Captioner] 19:52:19
TO PROVIDE THE ENCROACHMENT OF 

[Captioner] 19:52:20
PERMIT SERVICE, SO AS COUNCIL 

[Captioner] 19:52:23
KNOWS, YOU KNOW, STAFF LABOR 

[Captioner] 19:52:26
RATES HAVE INCREASED, AND SO 

[Captioner] 19:52:28
THAT IS AN ADJUSTMENT BASED ON 

[Captioner] 19:52:28
THAT FACTOR.

[Captioner] 19:52:31
SO I DON'T KNOW IF I HAVE A REAL 

[Captioner] 19:52:35
GOOD ANSWER OTHER THAN I THINK 

[Captioner] 19:52:38
WE'RE USING AN INDEX THAT HAS 

[Captioner] 19:52:40
SORT OF A PROVEN HISTORY AND 

[Captioner] 19:52:42
TRACK RECORD AND WHILE THIS YEAR 

[Captioner] 19:52:46
IS UNIQUE, WE FEEL THAT IT'S 

[Captioner] 19:52:47
JUSTIFIABLE GIVEN LAST YEAR 

[Captioner] 19:52:51
SEEMS TO BE UNIQUE LEHIGH.

[Captioner] 19:52:52
>> Councilmember Campbell: THANK 

[Captioner] 19:52:52
YOU.

[Captioner] 19:52:53
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU FOR THE 

[Captioner] 19:52:53
CLARIFICATION.

[Captioner] 19:52:55
I KNOW THE DEVELOPMENT IMPACT 

[Captioner] 19:52:56
FEE IS ONCE OF THE THINGS THAT 

[Captioner] 19:52:58
HE VERY DIFFICULT TO CALCULATE.

[Captioner] 19:52:59
I'VE SEEN IT OVER THE YEARS 

[Captioner] 19:53:00
WHETHER IT'S COMING FROM THE 

[Captioner] 19:53:01
SCHOOL SIDE OR FOR US LOOKING 

[Captioner] 19:53:06
OVER THE CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT 

[Captioner] 19:53:07
PROJECTS AS WE UPDATE EVERY TWO 

[Captioner] 19:53:07
YEARS.

[Captioner] 19:53:08
ONE THING THAT HAS BEEN PRUDENT 

[Captioner] 19:53:10
FOR US TO GET OUR PROJECTS 

[Captioner] 19:53:11
COMPLETED IS TO ENSURE THAT WE 

[Captioner] 19:53:13
DO LOOK FOR THESE UPTICKS IN 

[Captioner] 19:53:14
TERMS OF ADDITIONAL COSTS.

[Captioner] 19:53:15
IT HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANT THESE 

[Captioner] 19:53:15
LAST COUPLE YEARS.

[Captioner] 19:53:17
I KNOW THAT WITH THE BART AND 

[Captioner] 19:53:18
OTHER PROJECTS, THERE WAS 

[Captioner] 19:53:19
INCREASE ON CONCRETE AND THAT'S 

[Captioner] 19:53:21
WHY SO MANY OF THE PROJECTS GOT 

[Captioner] 19:53:23
DELAYED, AS WELL AS THE LABOR 

[Captioner] 19:53:23
COSTS.

[Captioner] 19:53:28
SO THEREFORE IT SEEMED TO BE A 

[Captioner] 19:53:28
WISE DECISION LAST YEAR.

[Captioner] 19:53:32
AND WE LOOK AT THESE INDEXES, 

[Captioner] 19:53:34
WHICH AS A -- I GUESS A LEVELING 

[Captioner] 19:53:36
POINT FOR US TO BE ABLE TO MAKE 

[Captioner] 19:53:36
OUR ADJUSTMENTS.

[Captioner] 19:53:38
I ALSO WANTED TO NOTE, THOUGH, 

[Captioner] 19:53:41
AT THE SAME TIME, THAT THIS MAY 

[Captioner] 19:53:43
BE ALSO THE REFLECTION AT THE 

[Captioner] 19:53:44
INDEX THAT THEY MAY HAVE 

[Captioner] 19:53:45
OVERCOMPENSATED LAST YEAR, 

[Captioner] 19:53:46
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW NOT JUST 

[Captioner] 19:53:47
FREMONT BUT SO MANY OTHER CITIES 

[Captioner] 19:53:49
RIGHT NOW ARE LOOKING AT HOUSING 

[Captioner] 19:53:51
PROJECTS, ARE LOOKING AT CAPITAL 

[Captioner] 19:53:52
IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS THAT YOU 

[Captioner] 19:53:53
SEE PEOPLE PULLING BACK ON.

[Captioner] 19:53:55
AND SO AS PROJECTS ARE BEING 

[Captioner] 19:53:57
PULLED BACK, THEN THERE'S MORE 

[Captioner] 19:53:58
OPPORTUNITY FOR MORE LABOR, AND 

[Captioner] 19:54:00
SO, THEREFORE, IT MAY BE LESS 

[Captioner] 19:54:01
COMPETITIVE FOR SECURING THAT 

[Captioner] 19:54:03
MAY ALSO REFLECT IN THE 

[Captioner] 19:54:04
REDUCTION IN THE COST, JUST FROM 

[Captioner] 19:54:06
THE ECONOMICAL VIEWPOINT ON 

[Captioner] 19:54:06
THAT.

[Captioner] 19:54:09
SO THAT BEING SAID, WE HAVE A 

[Captioner] 19:54:13
MOTION BY COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN, 

[Captioner] 19:54:16
A SECOND BY COUNCILMEMBER COX, 

[Captioner] 19:54:17
AND IF WE COULD PLEASE VOTE.

[Captioner] 19:54:27
SO THE DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEE 

[Captioner] 19:54:28
ITEM HAS BEEN APPROVED, ITEM 

[Captioner] 19:54:28
5B.

[Captioner] 19:54:29
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

[Captioner] 19:54:36
NEXT ON OUR AGENDA THIS EVENING 

[Captioner] 19:54:40
IS ITEM 6A, WHICH IS A 

[Captioner] 19:54:41
DISCUSSION ABOUT SHORT TERM 

[Captioner] 19:54:42
RENTAL ORDINANCE.

[Captioner] 19:54:44
THIS IS AN ITEM THAT WILL BE 

[Captioner] 19:54:45
PRESENTED THIS EVENING BY CODE 

[Captioner] 19:54:47
ENFORCE WENT MANAGER AND OUR 

[Captioner] 19:54:48
SENIOR PLANNER, DAVID WAGE, WHO 

[Captioner] 19:54:49
WILL SHARE WITH US A 

[Captioner] 19:54:49
PRESENTATION THIS EVENING.

[Captioner] 19:54:58
WELCOME, DIRECTOR.

[Captioner] 19:55:07
>> GOOD EVENING, MAYOR MEI, 

[Captioner] 19:55:07
MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL.

[Captioner] 19:55:09
DAVID WAGE, CODE ENFORCEMENT 

[Captioner] 19:55:09
MANAGER.

[Captioner] 19:55:19
THANKS.

[Captioner] 19:55:21
JUST WAITING FOR THE 

[Captioner] 19:55:21
PRESENTATION TO BE QUEUED UP.

[Captioner] 19:55:25
>> Ms. Gauthier: THERE WE GO.

[Captioner] 19:55:25
>> THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 19:55:28
SO THE ITEM BEFORE YOU THIS 

[Captioner] 19:55:30
EVENING IS A PROPOSED SHORT TERM 

[Captioner] 19:55:31
RENTAL ORDINANCE.

[Captioner] 19:55:35
I'LL START BY PROVIDING JUST A 

[Captioner] 19:55:36
LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND.

[Captioner] 19:55:38
A SHORT-TERM RENTAL IS A RENTAL 

[Captioner] 19:55:41
THAT REFERS TO AN ACTIVITY IN 

[Captioner] 19:55:42
WHICH ONE PARTY, THE HOST, 

[Captioner] 19:55:43
AGREES TO RENT OUT ALL OR A 

[Captioner] 19:55:45
PORTION OF THEIR HOME TO ANOTHER 

[Captioner] 19:55:46
PARTY, THE GUEST, FOR PERIODS OF 

[Captioner] 19:55:47
LESS THAN 30 NIGHTS.

[Captioner] 19:55:50
THE CITY OF FREMONT DOES NOT 

[Captioner] 19:55:51
CURRENTLY HAVE SPECIFIC SHORT 

[Captioner] 19:55:52
TERM RENTAL PROVISIONS IN ITS 

[Captioner] 19:55:53
MUNICIPAL CODE.

[Captioner] 19:55:54
HOWEVER, SHORT TERM RENTALS HAVE 

[Captioner] 19:55:55
BEEN ALLOWED TO OPERATE IN 

[Captioner] 19:55:57
ACCORDANCE WITH THE USE 

[Captioner] 19:55:58
PROVISIONS INCLUDED IN THE 

[Captioner] 19:55:59
RESIDENTIAL ZONING DISTRICTS 

[Captioner] 19:56:00
RELATED TO ROOM AND BOARD.

[Captioner] 19:56:03
ROOM AND BOARD IS LISTED AS AN 

[Captioner] 19:56:04
ACCESSORY USE AND ALLOWS A 

[Captioner] 19:56:06
DWELLING UNIT TO BE RENTED FOR 

[Captioner] 19:56:07
UP TO TWO PERSONS.

[Captioner] 19:56:09
THIS WAS ORIGINALLY INTENDED FOR 

[Captioner] 19:56:11
LONG-TERM RENTALS OF 30 DAYS OR 

[Captioner] 19:56:11
LONGER.

[Captioner] 19:56:14
BUT IT'S ALSO ALLOWED SHORT TERM 

[Captioner] 19:56:15
RENTALS TO OPERATE IN THE CITY.

[Captioner] 19:56:19
SO SOME REASONS WHY THE CITY IS 

[Captioner] 19:56:20
CONSIDERING A SHORT-TERM RENTAL 

[Captioner] 19:56:22
ORDINANCE, ONE OF THE REASONS IS 

[Captioner] 19:56:24
TO ADDRESS IMPACTS ON THE 

[Captioner] 19:56:24
COMMUNITY.

[Captioner] 19:56:28
MOST SHORT TERM RENTALS OPERATE 

[Captioner] 19:56:29
WITHOUT INCIDENT BUT THERE ARE 

[Captioner] 19:56:30
ISSUES THAT OCCUR RELATED TO 

[Captioner] 19:56:31
SHORT TERM RENTAL ACTIVITY, 

[Captioner] 19:56:33
COMMONLY NUISANCE ACTIVITY SUCH 

[Captioner] 19:56:35
AS NOISE OR TRASH OR PARKING 

[Captioner] 19:56:35
IMPACTS ON NEIGHBORHOODS.

[Captioner] 19:56:40
IN ADDITION, THE CITY -- THE 

[Captioner] 19:56:42
SHORT TERM RENTAL ORDINANCE HAS 

[Captioner] 19:56:43
BEEN PART OF THE CITY'S WORK 

[Captioner] 19:56:44
PROGRAM FOR A PERIOD OF TIME.

[Captioner] 19:56:47
THE CITY RECEIVED SB2 FUNDING TO 

[Captioner] 19:56:50
WORK ON HOUSING-RELATED PROGRAMS 

[Captioner] 19:56:51
AND THE SHORT TERM RENTAL 

[Captioner] 19:56:52
ORDINANCE WAS ONE OF THE 

[Captioner] 19:56:53
PROGRAMS IDENTIFIED AS PART OF 

[Captioner] 19:56:54
THAT GRANT FUNDING.

[Captioner] 19:56:57
FINALLY, IT WOULD ALSO -- SHORT 

[Captioner] 19:56:59
TERM RENTALS ALSO HAVE IMPACTS 

[Captioner] 19:57:01
ON THE CITY'S SUPPLY OF LONG 

[Captioner] 19:57:03
TERM HOUSING, AND THERE WAS A 

[Captioner] 19:57:04
HOUSING ELEMENT IMPLEMENTATION 

[Captioner] 19:57:05
MEASURE, PROGRAM NUMBER 9, WHICH 

[Captioner] 19:57:07
WAS INCLUDED IN THE CITY'S 

[Captioner] 19:57:10
RECENTLY ADOPTED HOUSING ELEMENT 

[Captioner] 19:57:11
IN WHICH THE CITY COMMITTED TO 

[Captioner] 19:57:12
ADOPT A SHORT-TERM RENTAL 

[Captioner] 19:57:16
ORDINANCE DESIGNED TO PRESERVE 

[Captioner] 19:57:16
LONG-TERM HOUSING.

[Captioner] 19:57:18
HERE YOU CAN SEE IN THE TWO 

[Captioner] 19:57:19
GRAPHICS, THE TOP ONE, SOME 

[Captioner] 19:57:21
EXAMPLES OF SHORT TERM RENTAL 

[Captioner] 19:57:26
SERVICE PROVIDERS ON THE 

[Captioner] 19:57:27
INTERNET, THAT COMMONLY PROVIDE 

[Captioner] 19:57:28
SHORT TERM RENTAL SERVICES TO 

[Captioner] 19:57:28
GUESTS.

[Captioner] 19:57:30
BELOW YOU SEE A MAP OF SHORT 

[Captioner] 19:57:31
TERM RENTALS OPERATING IN THE 

[Captioner] 19:57:31
CITY OF FREMONT.

[Captioner] 19:57:34
THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY 3-TO 400 

[Captioner] 19:57:37
UNIQUE SHORT TERM RENTAL 

[Captioner] 19:57:37
LISTINGS IN THE CITY CURRENTLY.

[Captioner] 19:57:39
AS YOU CAN SEE ON THE MAP, 

[Captioner] 19:57:40
THEY'RE FAIRLY EVENLY 

[Captioner] 19:57:41
DISTRIBUTED ACROSS THE CITY.

[Captioner] 19:57:44
NEXT I'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT 

[Captioner] 19:57:45
ABOUT THE IMPACTS OF SHORT TERM 

[Captioner] 19:57:49
RENTALS IN A LITTLE MORE 

[Captioner] 19:57:49
DETAIL.

[Captioner] 19:57:52
SHORT TERM RENTALS HAVE SOME 

[Captioner] 19:57:54
NEGATIVE IMPACTS.

[Captioner] 19:57:56
MOST OPERATE WITHOUT INCIDENT 

[Captioner] 19:57:57
BUT INTEREST ARE IMPACTS THAT 

[Captioner] 19:57:57
COME UP.

[Captioner] 19:57:58
A LOT OF TIMES RENTERS DON'T 

[Captioner] 19:58:00
KNOW OR FOLLOW RULES, RESULTING 

[Captioner] 19:58:01
IN PUBLIC SAFETY ISSUES, NOISE, 

[Captioner] 19:58:03
TRASH, PARKING AND OTHER IMPACTS 

[Captioner] 19:58:03
ON NEIGHBORS.

[Captioner] 19:58:07
THIS CAN OFTEN LEAD TO CONFLICTS 

[Captioner] 19:58:09
BETWEEN SHORT TERM RENTAL 

[Captioner] 19:58:10
OPERATORS AND NEIGHBORS.

[Captioner] 19:58:15
THERE ARE ALSO SO CALLED PARTY 

[Captioner] 19:58:16
HOUSES, HOMES RENTED OUT TO 

[Captioner] 19:58:17
LARGE GROUPS OF PEOPLE, WHICH 

[Captioner] 19:58:18
CAN IMPACT NEIGHBORS AND RESULT 

[Captioner] 19:58:19
IN CALLS FOR SERVICE TO THE 

[Captioner] 19:58:20
POLICE DEPARTMENT.

[Captioner] 19:58:24
AND TWO KIND OF EXTREME EXAMPLES 

[Captioner] 19:58:28
IN THE BAY AREA WERE INCIDENTS 

[Captioner] 19:58:30
BOTH IN RESULTED IN SHOOTINGS.

[Captioner] 19:58:33
FINALLY AS I MENTIONED, THE 

[Captioner] 19:58:34
CONVERSION OF RESIDENTIAL UNITS 

[Captioner] 19:58:36
INTO SHORT-TERM RENTALS CAN 

[Captioner] 19:58:38
RESULT IN LESS AVAILABILITY FOR 

[Captioner] 19:58:41
AFFORDABLE HOUSING OPTIONS AND 

[Captioner] 19:58:42
HIGHER RENTS.

[Captioner] 19:58:43
THAT BEING SAID, THERE ARE ALSO 

[Captioner] 19:58:45
POSITIVE IMPACTS RELATED TO 

[Captioner] 19:58:46
SHORT TERM RENTALS, INCLUDING 

[Captioner] 19:58:48
TOURISM AND POSITIVE IMPACTS ON 

[Captioner] 19:58:48
LOCAL ECONOMY.

[Captioner] 19:58:50
PEOPLE COME TO THE CITY TO STAY 

[Captioner] 19:58:51
HERE, WHETHER IT BE TO VISIT 

[Captioner] 19:58:55
FAMILY OR RECEIVE MEDICAL 

[Captioner] 19:58:56
SERVICES OR HERE FOR BUSINESS, 

[Captioner] 19:58:59
THEY STAY IN THE COMMUNITY AND 

[Captioner] 19:59:01
SPEND MONEY AND BENEFIT LOCAL 

[Captioner] 19:59:01
BUSINESSES.

[Captioner] 19:59:02
IN ADDITION, THE BAY AREA IS A 

[Captioner] 19:59:04
HIGH COST OF LIVING AREA, AND 

[Captioner] 19:59:06
SHORT TERM RENTALS ALLOW HOSTS 

[Captioner] 19:59:08
TO DERIVE SUPPLEMENTAL INCOME 

[Captioner] 19:59:10
THAT CAN HELP PAY THEIR RENT OR 

[Captioner] 19:59:10
MORTGAGE.

[Captioner] 19:59:12
SO IT HAS THE BENEFIT FOR 

[Captioner] 19:59:12
HOSTS.

[Captioner] 19:59:18
JUST TO SHARE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT 

[Captioner] 19:59:22
ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES, WE 

[Captioner] 19:59:24
COMMONLY RECEIVE COMPLAINTS FROM 

[Captioner] 19:59:24
RESIDENTS.

[Captioner] 19:59:26
THE CITY RECEIVES APPROXIMATELY 

[Captioner] 19:59:28
TWO PER MONTH RELATED TO SHORT 

[Captioner] 19:59:28
TERM RENTALS.

[Captioner] 19:59:30
WE ALSO OCCASIONALLY RECEIVE 

[Captioner] 19:59:30
REFERRALS FROM THE POLICE 

[Captioner] 19:59:31
DEPARTMENT WHEN THERE ARE 

[Captioner] 19:59:32
SIGNIFICANT INCIDENTS, KIND OF 

[Captioner] 19:59:33
LIKE THE PARTY HOUSE ACTIVITY I 

[Captioner] 19:59:34
REFERRED TO EARLIER.

[Captioner] 19:59:38
THESE CASES ARE VERY DIFFICULT 

[Captioner] 19:59:40
CURRENTLY TO ENFORCE ON.

[Captioner] 19:59:42
CURRENTLY THERE ARE A LACK OF 

[Captioner] 19:59:43
STANDARDS THAT ARE SPECIFICALLY 

[Captioner] 19:59:44
APPLICABLE TO SHORT TERM RENTALS 

[Captioner] 19:59:45
THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO REMEDY 

[Captioner] 19:59:46
SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT ARE 

[Captioner] 19:59:47
COMING UP.

[Captioner] 19:59:49
AND THEN IN ADDITION, IT'S VERY 

[Captioner] 19:59:50
DIFFICULT TO COLLECT EVIDENCE 

[Captioner] 19:59:52
WITH THE TOOLS WE HAVE NOW TO 

[Captioner] 19:59:53
EFFECTIVELY ENFORCE ON PROBLEM 

[Captioner] 19:59:54
PROPERTIES.

[Captioner] 20:00:01
SO AS A RESULT OF THE GROWTH OF 

[Captioner] 20:00:03
SHORT TERM RENTALS, MANY CITIES 

[Captioner] 20:00:04
HAVE TRIED TO GRAPPLE WITH 

[Captioner] 20:00:05
COMPETING BENEFITS AND 

[Captioner] 20:00:07
CHALLENGES, NA PARTICULAR, HOW 

[Captioner] 20:00:09
TO ADDRESS NEIGHBORHOOD ISSUES 

[Captioner] 20:00:11
AND SUPPORT LOCAL TOURISM AND 

[Captioner] 20:00:12
INCOME OPPORTUNITIES FOR 

[Captioner] 20:00:12
RESIDENTS.

[Captioner] 20:00:14
SO SOME OF THE SHORT TERM 

[Captioner] 20:00:16
ORDINANCE OBJECTIVES THAT WERE 

[Captioner] 20:00:17
INCLUDED IN THIS ORDINANCE WERE 

[Captioner] 20:00:20
AS I MENTIONED TO PREVENT THE 

[Captioner] 20:00:22
LOSS OF HOUSING STOCK AND 

[Captioner] 20:00:24
PRESERVE HOUSING, AND ALSO 

[Captioner] 20:00:25
ADDRESS SOME OF THE NUISANCE 

[Captioner] 20:00:27
IMPACTS I MENTIONED AND PRESERVE 

[Captioner] 20:00:28
AND PROTECT NEIGHBORHOODS AND BE 

[Captioner] 20:00:29
ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY RESPOND WHEN 

[Captioner] 20:00:32
WE DO RECEIVE NUISANCE-RELATED 

[Captioner] 20:00:32
COMPLAINTS.

[Captioner] 20:00:35
THAT BEING SAID, WE'RE ALSO 

[Captioner] 20:00:36
TRYING TO BALANCE THE NEEDS AND 

[Captioner] 20:00:37
RIGHTS OF PROPERTY OWNERS AND 

[Captioner] 20:00:39
QUALITY OF LIFE ISSUES FOR 

[Captioner] 20:00:39
NEIGHBORS.

[Captioner] 20:00:43
I MENTIONED CONTINUING TO ALLOW 

[Captioner] 20:00:44
ECONOMIC GAIN FOR RESIDENTS 

[Captioner] 20:00:45
ALLOWING THEM TO OPERATE SHORT 

[Captioner] 20:00:47
TERM RENTALS IN THEIR HOMES, AND 

[Captioner] 20:00:48
FINALLY, PROMOTE HEALTH AND 

[Captioner] 20:00:49
SAFETY FOR GUESTS WHO CHOOSE TO 

[Captioner] 20:00:51
STAY IN SHORT TERM RENTALS AND 

[Captioner] 20:00:52
THEN OF COURSE RESIDENTS WHO 

[Captioner] 20:00:53
LIVE NEAR THEM.

[Captioner] 20:01:03
SO TO MENTION A FEW OF THE KEY 

[Captioner] 20:01:04
PROVISIONS, THE CITY WOULD 

[Captioner] 20:01:05
CONTINUE TO ALLOW SHORT TERM 

[Captioner] 20:01:07
RENTALS BUT IT WOULD BE SUBJECT 

[Captioner] 20:01:09
TO A MINISTERIAL PERMIT.

[Captioner] 20:01:11
CURRENTLY THERE'S NO PERMIT FEE 

[Captioner] 20:01:12
PROPOSED AS PART OF THIS 

[Captioner] 20:01:13
PROGRAM, BUT IT IS SOMETHING THE 

[Captioner] 20:01:14
CITY WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR IN 

[Captioner] 20:01:17
TERMS OF WHAT THE ADMINISTRATIVE 

[Captioner] 20:01:18
COSTS OF THIS PROGRAM ARE AND 

[Captioner] 20:01:18
COULD COME BACK TO THE COUNCIL 

[Captioner] 20:01:21
IN THE FUTURE WITH A PERMIT FEE 

[Captioner] 20:01:23
IF IT MERITS IT.

[Captioner] 20:01:27
IN EFFORTS TO PROMOTE THE 

[Captioner] 20:01:28
PRESERVATION OF HOUSING, THERE 

[Captioner] 20:01:30
IS A REQUIREMENT THAT THE HOST 

[Captioner] 20:01:31
OPERATE THE SHORT TERM RENTAL 

[Captioner] 20:01:33
OUT OF THEIR PRIMARY RESIDENCE, 

[Captioner] 20:01:34
SO THEY CAN'T, FOR EXAMPLE, 

[Captioner] 20:01:36
PURCHASE A NUMBER OF PROPERTIES 

[Captioner] 20:01:37
AND OPERATE MULTIPLE SHORT TERM 

[Captioner] 20:01:40
RENTALS IN THE CITY.

[Captioner] 20:01:42
THERE'S A REQUIREMENT TO PROVIDE 

[Captioner] 20:01:44
-- WE WOULD CONTINUE TO ALLOW 

[Captioner] 20:01:46
BOTH HOSTED AND UNHOSTED RENTALS 

[Captioner] 20:01:49
BUT TO ADDRESS ISSUES WHERE 

[Captioner] 20:01:50
THERE'S NO ONE PRESENT AT THE 

[Captioner] 20:01:52
PROPERTY, IN THOSE INSTANCE 

[Captioner] 20:01:54
STANCES, WE REQUIRE THERE BE AN 

[Captioner] 20:01:55
ALTERNATIVE CONTACT PERSON ABLE 

[Captioner] 20:01:57
TO RESPOND TO ISSUES THAT ARISE 

[Captioner] 20:01:59
WITHIN 60 MINUTES SO IF THEY'RE 

[Captioner] 20:02:00
CONTACTED, THE EXPECTATION IS 

[Captioner] 20:02:02
THEY RESPOND AND THAT HOPEFULLY 

[Captioner] 20:02:03
REDUCES THE NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS 

[Captioner] 20:02:05
COMING TO EITHER CODE 

[Captioner] 20:02:07
ENFORCEMENT OR POLICE DEPARTMENT 

[Captioner] 20:02:08
WITH REQUEST TO RESPOND.

[Captioner] 20:02:09
THAT BEING SAID, THERE'S ALSO A 

[Captioner] 20:02:10
REQUIREMENT THAT SHORT TERM 

[Captioner] 20:02:11
RENTALS WOULD NOT BE ALLOWED IN 

[Captioner] 20:02:13
ACCESSORY DWELLING UNITS OR 

[Captioner] 20:02:14
JUNIOR ACCESSORY DWELLING 

[Captioner] 20:02:14
UNITS.

[Captioner] 20:02:16
THIS CURRENTLY REFLECTS 

[Captioner] 20:02:17
PROVISIONS IN STATE LAW AS WELL 

[Captioner] 20:02:19
AS THE CITY'S EXISTING ACCESSORY 

[Captioner] 20:02:20
DWELLING UNIT ORDINANCE SO THIS 

[Captioner] 20:02:22
IS NOT A NEW STANDARD, BUT 

[Captioner] 20:02:24
SOMETHING THAT'S JUST BEING 

[Captioner] 20:02:24
IMPLEMENTED AND REINFORCED 

[Captioner] 20:02:28
THROUGH THIS SHORT TERM RENTAL 

[Captioner] 20:02:28
ORDINANCE.

[Captioner] 20:02:31
IN ADDITION THERE WOULD BE A NEW 

[Captioner] 20:02:34
PERMIT PROCESS AS WELL AS A 

[Captioner] 20:02:36
PROCESS FOR PERMIT REVOCATION IF 

[Captioner] 20:02:39
THERE WAS AN ISSUE WITH A 

[Captioner] 20:02:43
PARTICULAR SHORT TERM RENTAL.

[Captioner] 20:02:47
THE CITY -- COLLECTING 

[Captioner] 20:02:48
INFORMATION THAT'S EFFECTIVE FOR 

[Captioner] 20:02:50
ENFORCEMENT AND ENSURING THAT 

[Captioner] 20:02:52
OPERATORS ARE FOLLOWING SHORT 

[Captioner] 20:02:53
TERM ORDINANCE RENTAL 

[Captioner] 20:02:53
PROVISIONS.

[Captioner] 20:03:00
THE CITY CONDUCTED EXTENSIVE 

[Captioner] 20:03:02
PUBLIC OUTREACH BEGINNING IN 

[Captioner] 20:03:04
SEPTEMBER OF 2022.

[Captioner] 20:03:06
WE LAUNCHED A SHORT-TERM RENTAL 

[Captioner] 20:03:07
WEBSITE WHICH YOU CAN SEE HERE 

[Captioner] 20:03:08
ON THE WEBPAGE.

[Captioner] 20:03:09
IT WENT LIVE TO SHARE 

[Captioner] 20:03:10
INFORMATION, ANSWER QUESTIONS 

[Captioner] 20:03:11
AND RECEIVE INPUT.

[Captioner] 20:03:12
IT ALSO PROVIDED RESIDENTS WITH 

[Captioner] 20:03:14
AN OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE A SURVEY 

[Captioner] 20:03:17
AND PROVIDE COMMENTS, AS WELL AS 

[Captioner] 20:03:18
A DISCUSSION FORUM.

[Captioner] 20:03:21
IN OCTOBER OF 2022, STAFF HELD A 

[Captioner] 20:03:22
VIRTUAL STAKEHOLDER COMMUNITY 

[Captioner] 20:03:24
MEETING TO DISCUSS THE PROPOSED 

[Captioner] 20:03:25
ORDINANCE, POTENTIAL CONTENTS OR 

[Captioner] 20:03:26
STANDARDS THAT MIGHT BE INCLUDED 

[Captioner] 20:03:28
IN IT, AS WELL AS RECEIVE 

[Captioner] 20:03:28
FEEDBACK FROM THE PUBLIC.

[Captioner] 20:03:31
THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY 10 

[Captioner] 20:03:31
ATTENDEES.

[Captioner] 20:03:35
THE MAJORITY OF THE ATTENDEES 

[Captioner] 20:03:37
WERE NEIGHBORS WHO HAD CONCERNS 

[Captioner] 20:03:38
ABOUT SHORT TERM RENTALS 

[Captioner] 20:03:41
OPERATING IN THEIR 

[Captioner] 20:03:41
NEIGHBORHOOD.

[Captioner] 20:03:43
MUCH OF THE FEEDBACK THAT WAS 

[Captioner] 20:03:44
RECEIVED GOT INCORPORATED INTO 

[Captioner] 20:03:44
THE ORDINANCE.

[Captioner] 20:03:46
THERE WERE ALSO OFFICE HOURS 

[Captioner] 20:03:47
HELD THAT PEOPLE COULD SIGN UP 

[Captioner] 20:03:49
FOR THE WEBSITE TO MEET 

[Captioner] 20:03:49
INDIVIDUALLY ONE-ON-ONE WITH 

[Captioner] 20:03:49
ME.

[Captioner] 20:03:51
FOUR INDIVIDUALS ATTENDED THOSE 

[Captioner] 20:03:52
OFFICE HOURS, AND ALL OF THOSE 

[Captioner] 20:03:54
PEOPLE WERE CURRENT OPERATORS OF 

[Captioner] 20:03:55
SHORT TERM RENTALS THAT HAD 

[Captioner] 20:03:57
QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS ABOUT THE 

[Captioner] 20:03:59
ORDINANCE PROCESS OR WHAT THE 

[Captioner] 20:04:00
CONTENTS OF THE ORDINANCE MIGHT 

[Captioner] 20:04:01
BE AND HOW IT MIGHT AFFECT THEIR 

[Captioner] 20:04:04
CURRENT OPERATIONS.

[Captioner] 20:04:05
IN ADDITION, THERE WERE NUMEROUS 

[Captioner] 20:04:07
ARTICLES PUBLISHED ON VARIOUS 

[Captioner] 20:04:09
CITY PUBLICATIONS AS WELL AS 

[Captioner] 20:04:09
SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNTS.

[Captioner] 20:04:11
STAFF ALSO CONDUCTED OUTREACH 

[Captioner] 20:04:13
WITH INTERNAL STAKEHOLDER, FOR 

[Captioner] 20:04:15
EXAMPLE, THE POLICE DEPARTMENT 

[Captioner] 20:04:16
AND CITY ATTORNEY'S OFFICE TO 

[Captioner] 20:04:18
DISCUSS THE CONTENTS OF THE 

[Captioner] 20:04:19
ORDINANCE, AND SHARE THE 

[Captioner] 20:04:21
PROPOSAL GOING FORWARD.

[Captioner] 20:04:24
WITH THAT BEING SAID, STAFF 

[Captioner] 20:04:25
RECOMMENDS THE CITY COUNCIL 

[Captioner] 20:04:27
WAIVE A FULL READING OF THE 

[Captioner] 20:04:32
 ORDINANCE AND INTRODUCE THE 

[Captioner] 20:04:34
SHORT TERM RENTAL ORDINANCE AS 

[Captioner] 20:04:34
DESCRIBED IN YOUR REPORT.

[Captioner] 20:04:36
IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, STAFF 

[Captioner] 20:04:37
WOULD BE HAPPY TO ANSWER THEM.

[Captioner] 20:04:37
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 20:04:39
AT THIS TIME I'D LIKE TO ASK FOR 

[Captioner] 20:04:39
CLARIFYING QUESTIONS.

[Captioner] 20:04:41
I SEE COUNCILMEMBER KENG.

[Captioner] 20:04:43
>> Councilmember Keng: THANK 

[Captioner] 20:04:44
YOU, MADAME MAYOR, AND THANK YOU 

[Captioner] 20:04:47
VERY MUCH FOR THE PRESENTATION 

[Captioner] 20:04:50
AS WELL AS GETTING THIS PROGRAM 

[Captioner] 20:04:50
TOGETHER.

[Captioner] 20:04:52
I DO BELIEVE THAT THERE IS -- IT 

[Captioner] 20:04:53
IS IMPORTANT TO MAIG SURE THAT 

[Captioner] 20:04:55
WE HAVE A CHECK AND BALANCE AND 

[Captioner] 20:05:00
ALSO TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE

[Captioner] 20:05:01
 SOME REGULATION SO IS THAT 

[Captioner] 20:05:02
THESE PARTY HOUSES, YOU KNOW, 

[Captioner] 20:05:04
ARE NOT AFFECTING THE 

[Captioner] 20:05:04
NEIGHBORHOODS.

[Captioner] 20:05:12
AND

[Captioner] 20:05:16
 DO WE HAVE A GOOD PLAN AND HOW 

[Captioner] 20:05:20
DO WE PLAN TO INFORM CURRENT 

[Captioner] 20:05:22
OWNERS OF THE PROGRAM, AND 

[Captioner] 20:05:23
SECOND QUESTION IS WHAT WERE 

[Captioner] 20:05:26
SOME OF THE QUESTIONS OR 

[Captioner] 20:05:30
CONCERNS FROM THE

[Captioner] 20:05:32
 OWNERS DURING THE OFFICE HOURS 

[Captioner] 20:05:33
AND WERE YOU ABLE TO PROVIDE 

[Captioner] 20:05:36
KIND OF GOOD ANSWERS FOR THEM?

[Captioner] 20:05:37
THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 20:05:38
>> THANK YOU FOR YOUR 

[Captioner] 20:05:38
QUESTIONS.

[Captioner] 20:05:40
IN TERMS OF THE FIRST QUESTION 

[Captioner] 20:05:40
REGARDING POTENTIAL OUTREACH IF 

[Captioner] 20:05:42
THE ORDINANCE IS ADOPTED, AS I 

[Captioner] 20:05:43
MENTIONED, THE THE CITY PLANS TO 

[Captioner] 20:05:44
WORK WITH THE HOST COMPLIANCE 

[Captioner] 20:05:48
COMPANY AND THEY'RE ABLE TO 

[Captioner] 20:05:49
GENERATE ADDRESSES FOR THOSE 

[Captioner] 20:05:50
PEOPLE WHO ARE OPERATING SHORT 

[Captioner] 20:05:52
TERM RENTALS IN THE CITY, SO 

[Captioner] 20:05:53
USING THAT INFORMATION, WE'D BE 

[Captioner] 20:05:56
ABLE TO TARGET PEOPLE OPERATING 

[Captioner] 20:05:57
SHORT TERM MENTALES AND MESSAGE 

[Captioner] 20:05:58
INFORMATION ABOUT THE ORDINANCE 

[Captioner] 20:06:02
AND KIND OF HOW TO SIGN UP, GET 

[Captioner] 20:06:03
A PERMIT, AND GO FORWARD AND 

[Captioner] 20:06:04
OPERATE LEGALLY IN ACCORDANCE 

[Captioner] 20:06:05
WITH THE ORDINANCE.

[Captioner] 20:06:10
SO THAT WOULD BE PART OF OUR

[Captioner] 20:06:11
 IMPLEMENTATION PROGRAM IF WERE 

[Captioner] 20:06:12
ADOPTED.

[Captioner] 20:06:14
REGARDING THE SECOND QUESTION, 

[Captioner] 20:06:15
THOSE WERE CONCERNS ABOUT PEOPLE 

[Captioner] 20:06:19
I MET WITH IN OFFICE HOURS.

[Captioner] 20:06:24
A LOT OF THEM HAD QUESTIONS AND 

[Captioner] 20:06:24
WERE LOOKING FOR INFORMATION 

[Captioner] 20:06:26
ABOUT WHAT WAS IN THE PROPOSED 

[Captioner] 20:06:27
ORDINANCE IN TERMS OF PROVISIONS 

[Captioner] 20:06:30
AND JUST CONCERNS THAT IT MAY 

[Captioner] 20:06:30
IMPACT THEM.

[Captioner] 20:06:32
CITYS HAVE A VARIETY OF 

[Captioner] 20:06:33
DIFFERENT OBJECTIVES THEY'RE 

[Captioner] 20:06:34
TRYING TO ACHIEVE WHEN IT COMES 

[Captioner] 20:06:36
TO THESE TYPES OF ORDINANCES, 

[Captioner] 20:06:37
AND SOME MIGHT BE MORE 

[Captioner] 20:06:37
RESTRICTIVE THAN OTHERS.

[Captioner] 20:06:41
BASED ON THE INFORMATION THAT I 

[Captioner] 20:06:43
SHARED DURING THE OFFICE HOURS, 

[Captioner] 20:06:44
THERE WASN'T ANY PARTICULAR 

[Captioner] 20:06:47
CONCERN THAT I CAN RECALL 

[Captioner] 20:06:49
REGARDING THE PROPOSED CONTENTS 

[Captioner] 20:06:51
OF THIS ORDINANCE.

[Captioner] 20:06:55
I THINK YOU DID RECEIVE SOME 

[Captioner] 20:06:56
COMMUNICATIONS FOLLOWING 

[Captioner] 20:06:58
PUBLICATION OF THE STAFF REPORT, 

[Captioner] 20:07:00
BUT I DON'T THINK THERE WAS TOO 

[Captioner] 20:07:02
MUCH IN THE WAY OF NEGATIVE 

[Captioner] 20:07:03
FEEDBACK OR COMMUNICATION THAT I 

[Captioner] 20:07:04
RECEIVED, EITHER THROUGH OFFICE 

[Captioner] 20:07:06
HOURS OR WRITTEN COMMUNICATION.

[Captioner] 20:07:07
>> Councilmember Keng: THANK 

[Captioner] 20:07:07
YOU.

[Captioner] 20:07:08
CAN I HAVE ONE QUICK QUESTION?

[Captioner] 20:07:12
DO YOU HAVE ANY DATA AS FAR AS 

[Captioner] 20:07:14
HOW MANY OF THE CURRENT -- OF 

[Captioner] 20:07:19
THE STR HOUSES ARE

[Captioner] 20:07:22
 PRIMARY RE DENSES OR NOT 

[Captioner] 20:07:22
PRIMARY RESIDENCE?

[Captioner] 20:07:23
>> I DON'T HAVE DATA RELATED TO 

[Captioner] 20:07:24
THAT QUESTION.

[Captioner] 20:07:27
>> Councilmember Keng: SO DO YOU 

[Captioner] 20:07:29
KNOW IF A LOT OF THE NEIGHBORING 

[Captioner] 20:07:30
CITIES ARE ADDING THIS 

[Captioner] 20:07:35
REQUIREMENT TO THEIR STR PERMIT 

[Captioner] 20:07:36
PROGRAM OR --

[Captioner] 20:07:39
>> SO I THINK THAT REQUIREMENT 

[Captioner] 20:07:41
ATTEMPTS TO ADDRESS TWO 

[Captioner] 20:07:41
OBJECTIVES.

[Captioner] 20:07:45
ONE IS THE PRESERVATION OF LONG 

[Captioner] 20:07:48
TERM HOUSING AND ENCOURAGING 

[Captioner] 20:07:51
THOSE UNITS TO REMAIN AS A 

[Captioner] 20:07:53
PRIMARY RESIDENCE AND NOT 

[Captioner] 20:07:54
PRIMARILY OPERATE AS A 

[Captioner] 20:07:55
SHORT-TERM RENTAL EXCLUSIVELY.

[Captioner] 20:07:58
AND THEN THE OTHER THING IS, IT 

[Captioner] 20:08:00
ENCOURAGES SOMEONE TO BE 

[Captioner] 20:08:01
AVAILABLE OR PRESENT IF THERE 

[Captioner] 20:08:02
ARE ISSUES.

[Captioner] 20:08:04
SO I THINK SOME CITIES HAVE A 

[Captioner] 20:08:06
PRIMARY RESIDENT REQUIREMENT 

[Captioner] 20:08:07
SIMILAR TO WHAT'S PROPOSED 

[Captioner] 20:08:07
HERE.

[Captioner] 20:08:11
OTHERS TRY AND ADDRESS THE SAME 

[Captioner] 20:08:12
ISSUE BY EITHER PROHIBITING 

[Captioner] 20:08:13
UNHOSTED RENTALS OR LIMITING THE 

[Captioner] 20:08:15
NUMBER OF DAYS THAT A RENTAL CAN 

[Captioner] 20:08:15
BE UNHOSTED.

[Captioner] 20:08:18
SO THERE'S DIFFERENT WAYS THAT I 

[Captioner] 20:08:19
THINK CITIES TRY AND ADDRESS THE 

[Captioner] 20:08:23
SAME ISSUE, AND THE PRIMARY 

[Captioner] 20:08:24
RESIDENCE REQUIREMENT IS KIND OF 

[Captioner] 20:08:25
THE RECOMMENDED BEST PRACTICE 

[Captioner] 20:08:27
BASED ON RECENTLY ADOPTED 

[Captioner] 20:08:31
ORDINANCES AND PUBLICATIONS FROM 

[Captioner] 20:08:32
THE NATIONAL LEAGUE OF CITIES 

[Captioner] 20:08:33
AND OTHER PEOPLE WORKING IN THE 

[Captioner] 20:08:33
FIELD.

[Captioner] 20:08:34
>> Councilmember Keng: THANK YOU 

[Captioner] 20:08:34
VERY MUCH.

[Captioner] 20:08:39
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 20:08:40
COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL.

[Captioner] 20:08:43
>> Councilmember Campbell: THANK 

[Captioner] 20:08:45
YOU FOR ALL OF THE HARD WORK 

[Captioner] 20:08:46
THAT WENT INTO THIS AND THANK 

[Captioner] 20:08:48
YOU FOR SOME OF MY QUESTIONS 

[Captioner] 20:08:48
EARLY ON.

[Captioner] 20:08:52
I JUST HAVE A COUPLE OF QUICK

[Captioner] 20:08:54
 QUESTIONS ON THE PRESENTATION, 

[Captioner] 20:08:57
YOU SAID YOU WERE GOING TO BE 

[Captioner] 20:08:59
LOOKING AT A COMPANY TO HELP 

[Captioner] 20:09:00
MONITOR THIS.

[Captioner] 20:09:03
IS THERE A COST ASSOCIATED WITH 

[Captioner] 20:09:03
THAT?

[Captioner] 20:09:05
>> YES, THERE IS A COST 

[Captioner] 20:09:06
ASSOCIATED WITH THAT.

[Captioner] 20:09:07
>> Councilmember Campbell: 

[Captioner] 20:09:07
OKAY.

[Captioner] 20:09:09
AND YOU ALSO SAID AT THIS POINT, 

[Captioner] 20:09:12
YOU WERE NOT LOOKING AT A FEE 

[Captioner] 20:09:14
FOR THE PERMITTING FEE, THERE 

[Captioner] 20:09:16
WILL BE NO -- YOU WERE GOING TO 

[Captioner] 20:09:17
BE LOOKING INTO IT AND 

[Captioner] 20:09:19
MONITORING TO SEE HOW MANY YOU 

[Captioner] 20:09:19
HAVE.

[Captioner] 20:09:21
HOW ARE WE PROPOSING TO PAY FOR 

[Captioner] 20:09:22
THE SERVICE THEN?

[Captioner] 20:09:24
IS THAT GOING TO COME OUT OF 

[Captioner] 20:09:27
GENERAL FUND OR --

[Captioner] 20:09:27
>> YES.

[Captioner] 20:09:30
THE FUNDS WOULD COME OUT OF THE 

[Captioner] 20:09:30
GENERAL FUND.

[Captioner] 20:09:31
>> Councilmember Campbell: 

[Captioner] 20:09:31
OKAY.

[Captioner] 20:09:32
DO WE HAVE AN ESTIMATE OF HOW 

[Captioner] 20:09:33
MUCH THAT MONITORING COMPANY FEE 

[Captioner] 20:09:34
IS GOING TO BE?

[Captioner] 20:09:37
>> YEAH, WE SENT A REQUEST FOR 

[Captioner] 20:09:39
PROPOSALS TO HOST COMPLIANCE 

[Captioner] 20:09:40
COMPANY, AND THE ESTIMATES VARY 

[Captioner] 20:09:42
BUT SOMEWHERE BETWEEN THE 

[Captioner] 20:09:43
MAGNITUDE WE ESTIMATE OF BETWEEN 

[Captioner] 20:09:44
30 AND $70,000 ANNUALLY.

[Captioner] 20:09:46
>> Councilmember Campbell: 30 TO 

[Captioner] 20:09:46
70.

[Captioner] 20:09:47
OKAY.

[Captioner] 20:09:48
OKAY.

[Captioner] 20:09:51
AND THEN THE OTHER QUESTION, I 

[Captioner] 20:09:52
KNOW YOU ANSWERED IT BUT I'M 

[Captioner] 20:09:54
STILL NOT CLEAR, BECAUSE IF I 

[Captioner] 20:09:59
LOOK AT PAGE 3 OF THE STAFF 

[Captioner] 20:10:01
REPORT UNDER -- IT'S CALLED 

[Captioner] 20:10:07
GENERAL REGULATIONS OF 

[Captioner] 20:10:12
5.100.040, THE FIRST, SECOND, 

[Captioner] 20:10:14
THIRD, FOURTH BULLET DOWN SAYS, 

[Captioner] 20:10:16
NO LIMIT ON THE NUMBER OF DAYS 

[Captioner] 20:10:16
STRs MAY BE RENTED.

[Captioner] 20:10:20
SO -- BUT IN THE RESPONSE THAT 

[Captioner] 20:10:22
YOU GAVE ME, YOU GAVE ME A 

[Captioner] 20:10:23
DEFINITION OF 30 DAYS.

[Captioner] 20:10:25
I DON'T SEE THAT IN HERE, SO IT 

[Captioner] 20:10:26
BECOMES CONFUSING AS TO WHAT 

[Captioner] 20:10:29
 THAT REALLY MEANS.

[Captioner] 20:10:31
>> SO THE LESS THAN 30 DAYS IS 

[Captioner] 20:10:33
ESSENTIALLY WHAT DEFINES A 

[Captioner] 20:10:33
SHORT-TERM RENTAL.

[Captioner] 20:10:35
SO A RENTAL THAT'S LESS THAN 30 

[Captioner] 20:10:37
DAYS IS DEFINED AS A SHORT-TERM 

[Captioner] 20:10:37
RENTAL.

[Captioner] 20:10:39
IF IT'S 30 DAYS OR MORE, IT'S 

[Captioner] 20:10:43
JUST CONSIDERED A TRADITIONAL

[Captioner] 20:10:44
 OR LONG TERM RENTAL.

[Captioner] 20:10:45
THAT YOU MENTIONED WHERE THERE'S 

[Captioner] 20:10:48
NO LIMIT ON NUMBER OF DAYS, THAT 

[Captioner] 20:10:51
JUST TO SAY THAT IS A RENTAL 

[Captioner] 20:10:52
LESS THAN 30 DAYS IN DURATION, 

[Captioner] 20:10:53
THERE'S NO LIMIT ON THE NUMBER 

[Captioner] 20:10:56
OF DAYS THEY CAN RENT OUT THEIR 

[Captioner] 20:10:57
UNIT TO AN INDIVIDUAL.

[Captioner] 20:10:58
OR GUEST.

[Captioner] 20:11:02
SO IF I'M OPERATING A SHORT-TERM 

[Captioner] 20:11:04
RENTAL, I COULD THEORETICALLY 

[Captioner] 20:11:07
HAVE SOMEONE -- A GUEST STAY IN 

[Captioner] 20:11:09
MY UNIT FOR THE ENTIRE YEAR.

[Captioner] 20:11:11
THE DURATION OF ANY ONE GUEST 

[Captioner] 20:11:13
WOULD BE LESS -- 29 DAYS OR 

[Captioner] 20:11:15
LESS, BUT THE TOTAL NUMBER OF 

[Captioner] 20:11:16
DAYS I'D BE OPERATING MY SHORT 

[Captioner] 20:11:18
TERM RENTAL IS NOT LIMITED.

[Captioner] 20:11:22
DOES THAT MAKE SENSE?

[Captioner] 20:11:26
>> IN THEORY, YOU COULD HAVE 300 

[Captioner] 20:11:27
DIFFERENT GUESTS OVER THE COURSE 

[Captioner] 20:11:29
OF A SINGLE YEAR, AND IT 

[Captioner] 20:11:33
WOULDN'T BE A

[Captioner] 20:11:39
 TENANCY BECAUSE NONE OF THOSE 

[Captioner] 20:11:41
SEPARATE AIRBNB -- BASICALLY 

[Captioner] 20:11:43
THAT FOURTH BULLET POINT DOESN'T 

[Captioner] 20:11:47
ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF TENANCY, IT 

[Captioner] 20:11:48
JUST ADDRESSES THE MOMOKO 

[Captioner] 20:11:50
ISHIJIMA EU OF HOW MANY TIMES 

[Captioner] 20:11:52
YOU COULD HOLD OUT A DWELLING 

[Captioner] 20:11:54
UNIT FOR AIRBNB, CONCEIVABLY YOU 

[Captioner] 20:11:56
COULD HAVE 300 DIFFERENT 

[Captioner] 20:11:58
INDIVIDUALS OVER THE COURSE OF A 

[Captioner] 20:11:59
YEAR RESERVE A PARTICULAR 

[Captioner] 20:12:01
DWELLING UNIT WITHOUT TRIGGERING 

[Captioner] 20:12:06
ANY TENANCY ISSUE.

[Captioner] 20:12:08
>> Councilmember Campbell: I GET 

[Captioner] 20:12:08
THAT.

[Captioner] 20:12:12
SO IS THERE ANY GAP BETWEEN MY 

[Captioner] 20:12:14
RENTING IT FOR 30 DAYS AND THEN 

[Captioner] 20:12:15
THE NEXT PERSON RENTING IT FOR 

[Captioner] 20:12:18
30 DAYS, OR CAN I RE-UP FOR 

[Captioner] 20:12:20
ANOTHER 30 DAYS?

[Captioner] 20:12:22
>> THE DURATION -- ANY SINGLE 

[Captioner] 20:12:23
DURATION WOULD BE 29 DAYS.

[Captioner] 20:12:26
I DON'T KNOW THAT IT SPECIFIES 

[Captioner] 20:12:28
ANY REQUIRED GAP, BUT ANY 

[Captioner] 20:12:29
INDIVIDUAL AGREEMENT OR ANYTHING 

[Captioner] 20:12:31
THAT WOULD CONSTITUTE A 

[Captioner] 20:12:32
SHORT-TERM RENTAL WOULD BE 29 

[Captioner] 20:12:32
DAYS OR LESS.

[Captioner] 20:12:37
AND THEN ON THE 30TH DAY, AS WAS

[Captioner] 20:12:40
 INDICATED BY CITY ATTORNEY 

[Captioner] 20:12:41
ALVARADO, THEY'D CONSIDERED A 

[Captioner] 20:12:42
LONG TERM TENANT AND A DIFFERENT 

[Captioner] 20:12:44
SET OF RULES AND REGULATIONS 

[Captioner] 20:12:44
WOULD APLAY.

[Captioner] 20:12:45
>> Councilmember Campbell: SO 

[Captioner] 20:12:47
I'D HAVE TO LEAVE AND COME BACK 

[Captioner] 20:12:48
IN A WEEK AND I COULD CONTINUE 

[Captioner] 20:12:52
TO DO THAT ALL YEARLONG, 

[Captioner] 20:12:52
CONCEIVABLY.

[Captioner] 20:12:53
>> CONCEIVABLY.

[Captioner] 20:12:57
AND A LOT OF THE HOSTING 

[Captioner] 20:12:58
COMPANIES ARE SET UP AND 

[Captioner] 20:13:02
DESIGNED WITH THIS IN MIND TO 

[Captioner] 20:13:04
LIMIT TENANCY.

[Captioner] 20:13:05
>> Councilmember Campbell: WELL, 

[Captioner] 20:13:07
TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY DON'T GET 

[Captioner] 20:13:09
INTO TENANCY RULES AND THAT KIND 

[Captioner] 20:13:09
OF STUFF.

[Captioner] 20:13:10
>> CORRECT.

[Captioner] 20:13:11
>> Councilmember Campbell: WHAT 

[Captioner] 20:13:12
ABOUT SQUATTERS?

[Captioner] 20:13:16
HAVE THERE BEEN ANY INCIDENCES 

[Captioner] 20:13:17
-- I KNOW I SAW SOME STUFF ON 

[Captioner] 20:13:20
THE NEWS ABOUT PEOPLE GOING INTO 

[Captioner] 20:13:24
AIRBNBs AND DECIDING NEVER TO 

[Captioner] 20:13:29
LEAVE, AND WIND UP BECOME THERE 

[Captioner] 20:13:30
FOR A YEAR OR TWO AND NEVER 

[Captioner] 20:13:31
HAVING TO PAY RENT.

[Captioner] 20:13:33
DOES THIS ORDINANCE PROTECT 

[Captioner] 20:13:35
HOMEOWNERS FROM THOSE KINDS OF 

[Captioner] 20:13:35
SCENARIOS?

[Captioner] 20:13:37
>> I WOULDN'T SAY THIS ORDINANCE 

[Captioner] 20:13:39
IS INTENDED TO PROTECT 

[Captioner] 20:13:40
HOMEOWNERS FROM THESE 

[Captioner] 20:13:40
SCENARIOS.

[Captioner] 20:13:42
THERE'S A DIFFERENT SET OF RULES 

[Captioner] 20:13:44
AND REGULATIONS, LAWS THAT WOULD 

[Captioner] 20:13:47
APPLY TO THAT SCENARIO OF 

[Captioner] 20:13:50
SQUATTERS AND SOMEONE STAYING 

[Captioner] 20:13:53
FOR MORE THAN -- ESTABLISHING 

[Captioner] 20:13:55
POTENTIALLY TENANCY OR JUST 

[Captioner] 20:13:55
TRESPASSING.

[Captioner] 20:13:57
SO DEPENDING ON THE 

[Captioner] 20:13:58
CIRCUMSTANCES, THERE ARE 

[Captioner] 20:13:59
DIFFERENT LAWS AND REGULATIONS 

[Captioner] 20:14:00
THAT I BELIEVE APPLY BUT THIS 

[Captioner] 20:14:02
LAW IS NOT INTENDED TO ADDRESS 

[Captioner] 20:14:02
THOSE.

[Captioner] 20:14:03
>> Councilmember Campbell: OKAY, 

[Captioner] 20:14:03
THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 20:14:03
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 20:14:05
CLARIFYING QUESTIONS BECAUSE WE 

[Captioner] 20:14:07
STILL HAVE TO OPEN THE PUBLIC 

[Captioner] 20:14:07
HEARING.

[Captioner] 20:14:08
CLARIFYING QUESTIONS, 

[Captioner] 20:14:08
COUNCILMEMBER COX.

[Captioner] 20:14:15
>> Councilmember Cox:

[Captioner] 20:14:21
 THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR 

[Captioner] 20:14:22
PRESENTATION.

[Captioner] 20:14:23
I HAD A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS.

[Captioner] 20:14:28
ONE IS, BEING ABLE TO MANAGE

[Captioner] 20:14:31
 THIS WITH YOUR DEPARTMENT, I 

[Captioner] 20:14:34
KNOW THAT YOU TALKED ABOUT 

[Captioner] 20:14:35
HAVING THE HELP OF THE HOSTING 

[Captioner] 20:14:39
MONITORING COMPANY TO TAKE PART 

[Captioner] 20:14:42
AND MANAGING THIS FROM DAY TO 

[Captioner] 20:14:43
DAY, BUT HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE IN 

[Captioner] 20:14:45
YOUR CODE ENFORCEMENT DEPARTMENT 

[Captioner] 20:14:46
AT THIS TIME?

[Captioner] 20:14:49
>> WE HAVE SIX CODE ENFORCEMENT 

[Captioner] 20:14:50
OFFICERS AND ONE ADMIN STAFF 

[Captioner] 20:14:50
PERSON.

[Captioner] 20:14:51
>> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.

[Captioner] 20:14:58
AND ADDITIONALLY, TRYING TO 

[Captioner] 20:15:00
UNDERSTAND, AS FAR AS LIKE THERE 

[Captioner] 20:15:01
WAS SOME WRITE-UP IN THE STAFF 

[Captioner] 20:15:03
REPORT ABOUT THERE'S A 

[Captioner] 20:15:06
NOTIFICATION TO THE NEIGHBORS 

[Captioner] 20:15:09
WITHIN 100 FEET, THAT THERE'S AN 

[Captioner] 20:15:09
STR.

[Captioner] 20:15:10
IS THAT SOMETHING THAT IS PART 

[Captioner] 20:15:12
OF THE SCOPE OF THE WORK OF THE 

[Captioner] 20:15:13
HOSTING MONITORING COMPANY, THAT 

[Captioner] 20:15:16
THEY'RE GOING TO WORK WITH OR 

[Captioner] 20:15:17
GIVE A PACKET SO IF SOMEBODY 

[Captioner] 20:15:21
SIGNS UP FOR STR, THEY GET A 

[Captioner] 20:15:23
PACKET AND A CHECKLIST TO MAKE 

[Captioner] 20:15:25
SURE THAT THINGS ARE BEING IN 

[Captioner] 20:15:27
COMPLIANCE AND THEY SIGN OFF ON, 

[Captioner] 20:15:29
I GUESS, THE GOOD NEIGHBOR 

[Captioner] 20:15:33
THING, BUT STATEMENT IN 

[Captioner] 20:15:35
AGREEMENT BUT ALSO THERE'S SOME 

[Captioner] 20:15:35
MARKETING MATERIAL OR SOMETHING 

[Captioner] 20:15:38
THAT WILL BE GOING AS A 

[Captioner] 20:15:39
CHECKLIST TO GIVE TO EACH PERSON 

[Captioner] 20:15:41
THAT SETS UP TO DO AN STR?

[Captioner] 20:15:45
>> YEAH, PERHAPS TO YOUR POINT, 

[Captioner] 20:15:48
WE'RE WORKING OUT DETAILS IN 

[Captioner] 20:15:50
TERMS OF THE REGISTRATION 

[Captioner] 20:15:52
PROCESS AND APPLICATION PROCESS, 

[Captioner] 20:15:54
IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH STAFF IS 

[Captioner] 20:15:56
INVOLVED VERSUS THE HOST 

[Captioner] 20:15:56
MONITORING COMPANIES.

[Captioner] 20:15:59
THEY DO PROVIDE THOSE SERVICES 

[Captioner] 20:16:01
IN TERMS OF ASSISTING WITH THE 

[Captioner] 20:16:04
PERMITTING PROCESS AND CAN 

[Captioner] 20:16:04
THEORETICALLY ASSIST WITH ALL OF 

[Captioner] 20:16:06
THE THINGS THAT ARE ENTAILED 

[Captioner] 20:16:08
WITH OUR APPLICATION PROCESS.

[Captioner] 20:16:12
BUT I THINK WE'RE KIND OF STILL 

[Captioner] 20:16:13
EXPLORING WHAT SERVICES WE WANT 

[Captioner] 20:16:16
THEM TO PROVIDE AND WHAT 

[Captioner] 20:16:17
SERVICES -- OR WHAT FUNCTION 

[Captioner] 20:16:19
STAFF WOULD PERFORM IN TERMS OF 

[Captioner] 20:16:20
IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS 

[Captioner] 20:16:20
ORDINANCE.

[Captioner] 20:16:22
>> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.

[Captioner] 20:16:26
IF THE HOST APPLIES, IS THERE A 

[Captioner] 20:16:28
SCOPE OF WORK TALKING ABOUT 

[Captioner] 20:16:31
BACKGROUND SCREENING OR CHECKING 

[Captioner] 20:16:33
TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT HOST IS 

[Captioner] 20:16:37
ACTUALLY THE LEGITIMATE OWNER BY 

[Captioner] 20:16:38
WAY OF PAPERWORK, WHETHER IT 

[Captioner] 20:16:42
PROPERTY TAXES OR THE EXTENSION 

[Captioner] 20:16:44
THAT'S REPORTED, IS THAT PART OF 

[Captioner] 20:16:45
THEIR SCOPE OF WORK?

[Captioner] 20:16:46
>> SO CHECKING FOR OWNERSHIP, 

[Captioner] 20:16:47
YOU'RE SAYING?

[Captioner] 20:16:51
>> Councilmember Cox: CHECKING 

[Captioner] 20:16:51
FOR OWNERSHIP.

[Captioner] 20:16:53
THE HOST COMES IN, THE PERSON 

[Captioner] 20:16:55
SAYS I OWN THIS PROPERTY, HOW DO 

[Captioner] 20:16:56
WE KNOW THAT THEY'RE THE OWNER 

[Captioner] 20:17:00
OR THEY COULD BE AN OWNER OF 

[Captioner] 20:17:01
MULTIPLE PEOPLE IN A POOL.

[Captioner] 20:17:04
>> SO WE DON'T -- WE'RE ONLY -- 

[Captioner] 20:17:07
THE HOST COULD BE AN OWNER OR A 

[Captioner] 20:17:07
RESIDENT.

[Captioner] 20:17:08
WE ALLOW BOTH.

[Captioner] 20:17:10
SO SOMEONE WHO'S RENTING COULD 

[Captioner] 20:17:11
THEORETICALLY ALSO BE A HOST 

[Captioner] 20:17:12
WITH THE PERMISSION OF THE 

[Captioner] 20:17:13
OWNER.

[Captioner] 20:17:15
SO WE CHECK FOR PRIMARY 

[Captioner] 20:17:16
RESIDENCY AS PART OF OUR 

[Captioner] 20:17:16
APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS.

[Captioner] 20:17:18
SO SOMEONE HAS TO PROVIDE LIKE A 

[Captioner] 20:17:21
PROOF OF RESIDENCE OR AN I.D. OR 

[Captioner] 20:17:23
SOME -- A UTILITY BILL, ET 

[Captioner] 20:17:23
CETERA.

[Captioner] 20:17:24
>> Councilmember Cox: BUT WHAT 

[Captioner] 20:17:25
DO YOU DO IF IT'S A POOL OF 

[Captioner] 20:17:27
PEOPLE, THAT IT COULD BE MORE 

[Captioner] 20:17:29
THAN ONE, YOU KNOW, IT COULD BE 

[Captioner] 20:17:30
FIVE, 10, 20 DIFFERENT PEOPLE 

[Captioner] 20:17:32
THAT COULD BE PART OF THE OWNER 

[Captioner] 20:17:33
OF THE HOUSE AND THEY ALL COULD 

[Captioner] 20:17:36
BE CONSIDERED A FRACTION OF "I'M 

[Captioner] 20:17:37
A HOST."

[Captioner] 20:17:38
HOW DO YOU HANDLE THAT?

[Captioner] 20:17:40
>> SO WE REQUIRE PERMISSION FROM 

[Captioner] 20:17:41
THE OWNER.

[Captioner] 20:17:42
>> Councilmember Cox: SO IT 

[Captioner] 20:17:43
WOULD BE ALL OF THEM?

[Captioner] 20:17:46
>> YEAH, AND WE HAVE CURRENTLY 

[Captioner] 20:17:49
ACCESS TO COUNTY ASSESSOR 

[Captioner] 20:17:51
RECORDS FOR WHO THE OWNER OF 

[Captioner] 20:17:51
RECORD IS.

[Captioner] 20:17:52
>> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.

[Captioner] 20:17:55
IF IN THE EVENT THAT THERE IS A 

[Captioner] 20:17:57
PROBLEM THAT OCCURS, AND I SAW 

[Captioner] 20:18:01
THAT THERE'S THAT 60-MINUTE 

[Captioner] 20:18:03
RESPONSE TIME THAT IS EXPECTED 

[Captioner] 20:18:05
BY THE HOST, SO WHAT IS THE 

[Captioner] 20:18:06
REPERCUSSIONS AT THIS POINT 

[Captioner] 20:18:08
SINCE WE DON'T HAVE LIKE A, PER 

[Captioner] 20:18:10
SE, PERMIT FEE OR OTHER 

[Captioner] 20:18:12
PENALTIES OR OTHER THINGS THAT 

[Captioner] 20:18:16
ARE KIND OF BEING DEVELOPED,

[Captioner] 20:18:20
 AND THE OTHER PART OF THAT HOST 

[Captioner] 20:18:21
MONITORING COMPANY, HOW YOU ARE 

[Captioner] 20:18:24
AND THE TEAM GOING TO BE ABLE TO 

[Captioner] 20:18:26
ENFORCE THIS ALONG WITH OUR 

[Captioner] 20:18:29
POLICE, BUT, YOU KNOW, THE 60 

[Captioner] 20:18:30
MINUTES COULD GO BY PRETTY 

[Captioner] 20:18:30
FAST.

[Captioner] 20:18:33
>> SO I THINK, YOU KNOW, WE TRY 

[Captioner] 20:18:35
AND EXERCISE DISCRETION, 

[Captioner] 20:18:36
DEPENDING ON THE NATURE OF THE 

[Captioner] 20:18:36
ISSUE.

[Captioner] 20:18:37
SO IF IT'S SOMETHING LIKE 

[Captioner] 20:18:39
SOMEONE LEFT A TRASH CAN OUT IS 

[Captioner] 20:18:40
THE COMPLAINT, WE MIGHT TREAT 

[Captioner] 20:18:42
THAT DIFFERENTLY THAN THERE WAS 

[Captioner] 20:18:43
AN INCIDENT AT A PARTY HOUSE 

[Captioner] 20:18:44
WHERE THE POLICE WERE CALLED AND 

[Captioner] 20:18:46
THERE WAS A DISTURBANCE OF SOME 

[Captioner] 20:18:46
SORT.

[Captioner] 20:18:49
SO I THINK WE TRY AND EVALUATE 

[Captioner] 20:18:51
WHAT THE ISSUE IS, AND THEN COME 

[Captioner] 20:18:52
UP WITH AN APPROPRIATE 

[Captioner] 20:18:52
RESPONSE.

[Captioner] 20:18:55
IT COULD BE SOMETHING AS SIMPLE 

[Captioner] 20:18:57
AS SENDING AN ADMINISTRATIVE 

[Captioner] 20:19:01
WARNING

[Captioner] 20:19:03
 LETTER INDICATING WE RECEIVED A 

[Captioner] 20:19:04
COMPLAINT, OR WE RECEIVED A 

[Captioner] 20:19:05
COMPLAINT, THIS WAS A TIME LE 

[Captioner] 20:19:06
ISSUE, YOU'VE BEEN WARNED ABOUT 

[Captioner] 20:19:07
THE ISSUE THAT OCCURRED.

[Captioner] 20:19:12
OR WE ARE -- THESE SHORT TERM 

[Captioner] 20:19:13
RENTALS ARE SUBJECT TO OUR 

[Captioner] 20:19:15
ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES 

[Captioner] 20:19:17
PROVISIONS IN THE FREMONT 

[Captioner] 20:19:18
MUNICIPAL CODE, WHICH INCLUDES 

[Captioner] 20:19:19
THE CITATION SCHEDULE.

[Captioner] 20:19:21
THE FIRST CITATION WOULD BE, FOR 

[Captioner] 20:19:21
EXAMPLE, $100.

[Captioner] 20:19:23
THEN FOR EXTREME EXAMPLES, MAYBE 

[Captioner] 20:19:24
LIKE THE ONE I GAVE WHERE THE 

[Captioner] 20:19:25
POLICE WERE CALLED WHERE THERE'S 

[Captioner] 20:19:30
A PARTY HOUSE, THE ORDINANCE 

[Captioner] 20:19:35
DOES ADOPT UNIQUE PROVISIONS 

[Captioner] 20:19:37
RELATED TO ENFORCEMENT AND 

[Captioner] 20:19:39
PENALTIES WHERE THERE'S A 

[Captioner] 20:19:40
SPECIFIC HEALTH AND SAFETY 

[Captioner] 20:19:41
CONCERN AND THOSE PENALTIES ARE 

[Captioner] 20:19:43
STEEPER THAN WHAT'S IN OUR 

[Captioner] 20:19:44
REGULAR ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES 

[Captioner] 20:19:44
ORDINANCE.

[Captioner] 20:19:47
THE FIRST FINE FOR THOSE TYPES 

[Captioner] 20:19:50
OF PENALTIES CAN BE UP TO 

[Captioner] 20:19:50
$1,500.

[Captioner] 20:19:51
>> Councilmember Cox: SO 

[Captioner] 20:19:53
BASICALLY IT WOULD GO BACK TO 

[Captioner] 20:19:54
WHAT WE HAVE EXISTING ON THE 

[Captioner] 20:19:57
BOOKS OR COULD WE ADOPT IT SINCE 

[Captioner] 20:20:01
WE'RE KIND OF LAUNCHING THIS AS 

[Captioner] 20:20:03
A NEW PROGRAM TO BE IMPLEMENTED 

[Captioner] 20:20:03
ON THE CITY.

[Captioner] 20:20:06
AND I JUST HAD WANTED TO JUST 

[Captioner] 20:20:08
KIND OF UNDERSTAND A LITTLE BIT 

[Captioner] 20:20:10
MORE HOW WE'RE GOING FORWARD 

[Captioner] 20:20:11
WITH THAT, AND WITH THE 

[Captioner] 20:20:13
UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE IS SOME 

[Captioner] 20:20:14
THINGS STILL TO BE WORKED OUT 

[Captioner] 20:20:17
AND THEN YOU'LL BE COMING BACK 

[Captioner] 20:20:21
TO CITY COUNCIL TO REPORT OUT ON 

[Captioner] 20:20:23
WHAT KIND OF TIME FRAME ARE WE 

[Captioner] 20:20:24
LOOKING AT FOR SAYING, YOU KNOW, 

[Captioner] 20:20:27
ARE YOU GOING TO SET UP A PERMIT 

[Captioner] 20:20:30
FEE AND OTHER UNIQUENESS WITH 

[Captioner] 20:20:31
THE PROGRAM THAT YOU'RE ROLLING 

[Captioner] 20:20:35
OUT, AND GIVING US AN UPDATE, 

[Captioner] 20:20:36
WHEN DO YOU THINK WE WOULD HAVE 

[Captioner] 20:20:37
A NEW UPDATE?

[Captioner] 20:20:40
PROVIDING THAT WE APPROVE IT 

[Captioner] 20:20:41
TONIGHT, BUT WHEN WOULD WE 

[Captioner] 20:20:44
EXPECT TO HAVE SOME MORE 

[Captioner] 20:20:45
INFORMATION ON HOW WELL THINGS 

[Captioner] 20:20:50
ARE GOING AND --

[Captioner] 20:20:52
>> WE'D SEE THIS AS BEING SORT 

[Captioner] 20:20:53
OF INTEGRATED IN ALL OF OUR CODE 

[Captioner] 20:20:54
ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES.

[Captioner] 20:20:57
WE DON'T TYPICALLY PREPARE 

[Captioner] 20:20:58
REGULAR REPORTS TO COUNCIL ON 

[Captioner] 20:20:58
ALL OF THOSE.

[Captioner] 20:21:02
WE'RE ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS IF 

[Captioner] 20:21:03
THERE'S SPECIFIC, YOU KNOW, 

[Captioner] 20:21:04
CASES THAT THE COUNCIL IS 

[Captioner] 20:21:05
PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN.

[Captioner] 20:21:07
BUT WE CERTAINLY CAN DO THAT.

[Captioner] 20:21:11
IT'S JUST -- WE HAVEN'T DONE 

[Captioner] 20:21:13
THAT IN THE PAST, WE DON'T HAVE 

[Captioner] 20:21:15
A SCHEDULE, YOU KNOW --

[Captioner] 20:21:17
>> Mayor Mei: TO CLARIFY FOR THE 

[Captioner] 20:21:19
RECOMMENDATIONS AS IT STANDS, 

[Captioner] 20:21:20
TONIGHT WHAT WE'RE DOING, AND 

[Captioner] 20:21:21
WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS AFTER WE 

[Captioner] 20:21:23
ALSO HEAR FROM THE PUBLIC ONCE 

[Captioner] 20:21:24
WE OPEN THE PUBLIC HEARING, BUT 

[Captioner] 20:21:26
IT'S TO FIND THE SHORT TERM 

[Captioner] 20:21:28
RENTAL ORDINANCE AS EXEMPT FROM 

[Captioner] 20:21:30
THE REQUIREMENTS AND TO WAIVE 

[Captioner] 20:21:31
THE FIRST READING AND INTRODUCE 

[Captioner] 20:21:33
THE ORDINANCE, WHICH OUR CITY 

[Captioner] 20:21:36
ATTORNEY WILL BE ABLE TO ADD THE 

[Captioner] 20:21:39
CHAPTER 5.10 SEAR OWE TO THE 

[Captioner] 20:21:39
MUNICIPAL CODE AND THEN TO 

[Captioner] 20:21:40
PREPARE A POST SUMMARY.

[Captioner] 20:21:42
IT DOESN'T HAVE AT THIS TIME PER 

[Captioner] 20:21:44
THE STAFF RECOMMENDATIONS ANY 

[Captioner] 20:21:45
FOLLOW-UP IN TERMS OF ADDITIONAL 

[Captioner] 20:21:47
OTHER THAN THE REGULAR CODE 

[Captioner] 20:21:47
ENFORCEMENT.

[Captioner] 20:21:48
>> Councilmember Cox: THAT'S WHY 

[Captioner] 20:21:49
I'VE GOT TO ASK SOME OF THE 

[Captioner] 20:21:52
QUESTIONS, BECAUSE THIS IS 

[Captioner] 20:21:53
CLARIFYING ME AS I'M GOING 

[Captioner] 20:21:54
THROUGH AND UNDERSTANDING THE 

[Captioner] 20:21:56
MATERIAL, IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE 

[Captioner] 20:21:58
UNDERSTAND IF THERE'S ANY CIRCLE 

[Captioner] 20:22:00
BACK OR FOLLOW-UP ACTIONS 

[Captioner] 20:22:03
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW THIS IS NOT A 

[Captioner] 20:22:03
SUSTAINING PROGRAM, AND IT 

[Captioner] 20:22:05
SOUNDS LIKE WE'RE GOING TO BE 

[Captioner] 20:22:09
HAVING TO PAY 30 TO $70,000 TO

[Captioner] 20:22:10
 IMPLEMENT IT, WHICH WHERE IS 

[Captioner] 20:22:14
THAT MONEY COMING FROM AS FAR AS 

[Captioner] 20:22:14
OPERATING THIS PROGRAM, SO 

[Captioner] 20:22:15
THERE'S SOME MISSING PIECES HERE 

[Captioner] 20:22:18
THAT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR 

[Captioner] 20:22:19
ME AND FOR MY OTHER COLLEAGUES 

[Captioner] 20:22:21
AND THE PUBLIC TO KNOW SOME MORE 

[Captioner] 20:22:22
DETAILS ON THIS.

[Captioner] 20:22:25
SO --

[Captioner] 20:22:27
>> City Mgr. Shackelford: SO AS 

[Captioner] 20:22:28
DAN STATED THIS, IS SOMETHING 

[Captioner] 20:22:29
THAT WOULD BE INTEGRATED INTO 

[Captioner] 20:22:30
THEIR NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS 

[Captioner] 20:22:33
OF DOING CODE ENFORCEMENT, AND 

[Captioner] 20:22:34
THAT ISN'T SOMETHING THAT WE 

[Captioner] 20:22:36
TYPICALLY COME BACK AND REPORT 

[Captioner] 20:22:37
ON ON A REGULAR BASIS.

[Captioner] 20:22:42
A GOOD PLACE, IF A COUNCILMEMBER

[Captioner] 20:22:44
 WANTED INFORMATION OR WANTED AN 

[Captioner] 20:22:45
UPDATE, A GOOD PLACE TO GET 

[Captioner] 20:22:47
THOSE UPDATES WOULD BE IN YOUR 

[Captioner] 20:22:48
MONTHLY COUNCIL BRIEFING.

[Captioner] 20:22:50
AND SO FOR ITEMS LIKE THAT WHERE 

[Captioner] 20:22:52
YOU DO WANT TO DIG A LITTLE 

[Captioner] 20:22:53
DEEPER OR HAVE A BETTER 

[Captioner] 20:22:55
UNDERSTANDING OR SOME SORT OF 

[Captioner] 20:22:56
UPDATE, THAT WILL BE THE FORUM 

[Captioner] 20:22:58
IN WHICH THAT WOULD BE -- IN 

[Captioner] 20:22:59
WHICH THAT WOULD OCCUR.

[Captioner] 20:23:00
>> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.

[Captioner] 20:23:01
I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH 

[Captioner] 20:23:01
THAT.

[Captioner] 20:23:03
I JUST NEEDED TO GET SOME MORE 

[Captioner] 20:23:04
INFORMATION AT THIS POINT.

[Captioner] 20:23:08
AND WITH THE 30 OR $70,000, IS 

[Captioner] 20:23:10
THAT PART OF INCLUDED IN THE 

[Captioner] 20:23:11
BUDGET THAT WE APPROVED THIS 

[Captioner] 20:23:11
PAST YEAR?

[Captioner] 20:23:13
WAS THAT ANTICIPATED BUT YOU 

[Captioner] 20:23:15
JUST SOUND LIKE YOU JUST CLOSED 

[Captioner] 20:23:17
YOUR SOLICITATION JUST RECENTLY 

[Captioner] 20:23:19
TO BE ABLE TO LOOK AT SOME OF 

[Captioner] 20:23:20
THE PROPOSALS.

[Captioner] 20:23:22
HOW IS THAT MONEY AND WHERE IS 

[Captioner] 20:23:23
THAT COMING FROM?

[Captioner] 20:23:25
>> SO IT IS NOT IN OUR ACCRUED 

[Captioner] 20:23:25
BUDGET.

[Captioner] 20:23:28
THE PLAN IS THAT WE'RE GOING TO 

[Captioner] 20:23:30
REVIEW THE VARIOUS PROPOSALS 

[Captioner] 20:23:34
THAT WE GOT, TRY TO REFINE THE 

[Captioner] 20:23:37
SCOPE, AND THEN WE WOULD COME TO 

[Captioner] 20:23:38
COUNCIL FOR APPROVAL OF THE 

[Captioner] 20:23:39
CONTRACT AND APPROPRIATION OF 

[Captioner] 20:23:40
THOSE FUNDS.

[Captioner] 20:23:41
>> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.

[Captioner] 20:23:44
SO THAT WILL BE PART 2 OF WHAT 

[Captioner] 20:23:46
WE'D BE ANTICIPATING AND BEING 

[Captioner] 20:23:48
ABLE TO IMPLEMENT THE PROGRAM.

[Captioner] 20:23:51
AND GETTING THAT SPECIFIC 

[Captioner] 20:23:52
CONTRACT SIGNED OFF AND APPROVED 

[Captioner] 20:23:53
BY COUNCIL.

[Captioner] 20:23:53
OKAY.

[Captioner] 20:23:57
>> AND THE APPROPRIATION OF THE 

[Captioner] 20:23:59
FUNDS -- SOME OF IT DEPENDS ON 

[Captioner] 20:23:59
TIMING.

[Captioner] 20:24:01
WE MIGHT INCLUDE APPROPRIATION 

[Captioner] 20:24:06
OF FUNDS IN THE BUDGET PROCESS 

[Captioner] 20:24:07
IN ANTICIPATION OF THE FACT THAT 

[Captioner] 20:24:09
WE'RE GOING TO BE BACK GETTING A 

[Captioner] 20:24:09
CONTRACT APPROVED.

[Captioner] 20:24:13
SO EITHER WAY, THE COUNCIL WILL 

[Captioner] 20:24:16
HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO WEIGH IN 

[Captioner] 20:24:17
ON THE APPROPRIATION OF THE 

[Captioner] 20:24:17
FUNDS.

[Captioner] 20:24:19
>> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.

[Captioner] 20:24:23
DO YOU FORESEE ANY ADDITIONAL 

[Captioner] 20:24:24
ADDING A RESOURCE TO HELP YOU 

[Captioner] 20:24:25
IMPLEMENT THIS PROGRAM?

[Captioner] 20:24:31
>> EVEN WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF A 

[Captioner] 20:24:34
HOST MONITORING COMPANY, THERE 

[Captioner] 20:24:35
WILL BE STAFF TIME REQUIRED, 

[Captioner] 20:24:37
MAYBE A HALF, FULL TIME EMPLOYEE 

[Captioner] 20:24:37
AT THE MOST.

[Captioner] 20:24:38
>> Councilmember Cox: ADDITIONAL?

[Captioner] 20:24:41
>> WE'RE NOT REQUESTING 

[Captioner] 20:24:42
ADDITIONAL STAFFING AT THIS 

[Captioner] 20:24:42
TIME.

[Captioner] 20:24:45
WE FEEL LIKE WE HAVE CAPACITY TO 

[Captioner] 20:24:48
-- AND AGAIN, THESE AREN'T NEW 

[Captioner] 20:24:48
ISSUES.

[Captioner] 20:24:50
THIS WOULD BE AN ORDINANCE TO 

[Captioner] 20:24:51
ADDRESS ISSUES THAT ALREADY 

[Captioner] 20:24:52
EXIST IN THE CITY.

[Captioner] 20:24:55
WE FEEL LIKE THESE TOOLS WOULD 

[Captioner] 20:24:56
ACTUALLY POTENTIALLY IN SOME 

[Captioner] 20:24:56
WAYS SAVE TIME.

[Captioner] 20:24:59
IT IS A NEW PROGRAM ADMITTEDLY, 

[Captioner] 20:25:00
BUT YOU KNOW, THESE ARE ISSUES 

[Captioner] 20:25:02
THAT WE'RE ALREADY DEALING WITH, 

[Captioner] 20:25:06
AND TAKE UP A LOT OF CAPACITY 

[Captioner] 20:25:08
BECAUSE WE HAVE LIMITED TOOLS 

[Captioner] 20:25:08
CURRENTLY.

[Captioner] 20:25:09
>> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.

[Captioner] 20:25:09
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

[Captioner] 20:25:13
>> Mayor Mei: CLARIFYING 

[Captioner] 20:25:13
QUESTIONS, COUNCILMEMBER KENG?

[Captioner] 20:25:15
OTHERWISE I WOULD LIKE TO OPEN 

[Captioner] 20:25:15
THE PUBLIC HEARING.

[Captioner] 20:25:17
AT THIS TIME, I'D LIKE TO OPEN 

[Captioner] 20:25:18
THE PUBLIC HEARING, AND ARE 

[Captioner] 20:25:21
THERE ANY SPEAKER CARDS FOR 

[Captioner] 20:25:21
THIS?

[Captioner] 20:25:25
>> Ms. Gauthier: WE HAVE TWO 

[Captioner] 20:25:25
SPEAKERS.

[Captioner] 20:25:27
ROM STANLEY FOLLOWED BY KELLY 

[Captioner] 20:25:27
ABREU.

[Captioner] 20:25:30
>> Mayor Mei: WELCOME.

[Captioner] 20:25:43
>> GOOD EVENING TO YOU ALL.

[Captioner] 20:25:45
I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU ALL FOR 

[Captioner] 20:25:46
BEING HERE AND MAKING THE 

[Captioner] 20:25:49
PERSONAL SACRIFICES THAT YOU'VE 

[Captioner] 20:25:50
MADE THIS EVENING.

[Captioner] 20:25:51
IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT THERE 

[Captioner] 20:25:56
AREN'T MANY FOLKS HERE THAT

[Captioner] 20:25:59
 ARE EITHER FOR OR AGAINST THIS 

[Captioner] 20:25:59
PROPOSED ORDINANCE.

[Captioner] 20:26:02
I'M NOT NECESSARILY THE BEST 

[Captioner] 20:26:03
PUBLIC SPEAKER AND I'VE HAD A 

[Captioner] 20:26:06
VERY LONG DAY, BUT I WILL TAKE 

[Captioner] 20:26:08
SOME TIME JUST TO CONVEY SOME OF 

[Captioner] 20:26:09
MY LITTLE SCRIBBLES HERE.

[Captioner] 20:26:13
SO I WAS CONCERNED ABOUT THE 

[Captioner] 20:26:14
LANGUAGE IN THE ORDINANCE, AND 

[Captioner] 20:26:15
IT SAYS TRANSIENT.

[Captioner] 20:26:17
AND I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S LIKE 

[Captioner] 20:26:19
NEW WAVE THINKING OR SOMETHING?

[Captioner] 20:26:21
I'VE ALWAYS HAD A CONNECTION 

[Captioner] 20:26:23
WITH THE TRANSIENT AS BEING 

[Captioner] 20:26:26
SOMEBODY OUT ON THE STREET AND 

[Captioner] 20:26:26
AS SUCH.

[Captioner] 20:26:32
I THINK THAT AIR B -- I AM A 

[Captioner] 20:26:34
HOST, MY FIRST NAME IS RON 

[Captioner] 20:26:35
STANLEY, I LIVE HERE IN TOWN.

[Captioner] 20:26:38
ANYWAY, SO I THINK IT'S GOOD FOR 

[Captioner] 20:26:38
CONSUMERS.

[Captioner] 20:26:42
IT'S CREATED A LARGE AMOUNT OF 

[Captioner] 20:26:42
COMPETITION.

[Captioner] 20:26:45
IT IS POSSIBLY EVEN UPPED THE 

[Captioner] 20:26:47
STANDARDS OF HOSPITALITY AND 

[Captioner] 20:26:50
THAT COULD BE IN REGARDS TO 

[Captioner] 20:26:52
HEALTH AND SAFETY WHERE LIKE 

[Captioner] 20:26:54
WHEN I HAVE LINENS AT HOME AND 

[Captioner] 20:26:56
THE TOP SHEET AND THAT, THE 

[Captioner] 20:26:58
COMFORTER OR WHATEVER, IT GETS 

[Captioner] 20:26:59
WASHED AFTER EVERY GUEST.

[Captioner] 20:27:02
THERE'S BEEN TV SHOWS LIKE 60 

[Captioner] 20:27:04
MINUTES, 2020, WHERE THEY'VE 

[Captioner] 20:27:06
SHOWN HOTELS THAT ARE JUST 

[Captioner] 20:27:09
DIRTY, HAVE STUFF ON THE WALLS, 

[Captioner] 20:27:09
THE WHOLE THING.

[Captioner] 20:27:18
PARTY

[Captioner] 20:27:20
 HOUSES, I THINK AIRBNB HAS 

[Captioner] 20:27:22
RECENTLY IMPLEMENTED A POLICY 

[Captioner] 20:27:24
GLOBALLY WHERE THEY DON'T PERMIT 

[Captioner] 20:27:25
PARTY HOUSES ANY LONGER.

[Captioner] 20:27:26
THAT WAS PROBABLY LIKE WITHIN 

[Captioner] 20:27:29
THE LAST WEEK OR SO, AND THEY 

[Captioner] 20:27:31
HAD REALLY, REALLY GOTTEN ON TOP 

[Captioner] 20:27:34
OF THE SITUATION DURING THE 

[Captioner] 20:27:34
LAFAYETTE INCIDENT.

[Captioner] 20:27:37
LET'S SEE HERE.

[Captioner] 20:27:49
YEAH, AND THE HEALTH AND SAFETY, 

[Captioner] 20:27:51
IT'S COVERED IN THE REVIEW 

[Captioner] 20:27:51
PROCESS.

[Captioner] 20:27:56
AS A TAXPAYER AND ALL THAT, NOT 

[Captioner] 20:27:58
THAT I PAY A LOT, I DO FILE 

[Captioner] 20:28:00
TAXES ON THIS INCOME.

[Captioner] 20:28:03
IF ANYBODY SHOULD ASK, I'M 

[Captioner] 20:28:05
CONCERNED ABOUT THIS 

[Captioner] 20:28:05
MONITORING.

[Captioner] 20:28:08
THIS IS ALL NEWS TO ME OF 70 OR 

[Captioner] 20:28:09
$100,000 FOR THIS MONITORING.

[Captioner] 20:28:12
BUT I REALLY WISH THAT OTHER 

[Captioner] 20:28:14
HOUSE -- IS MY TIME UP?

[Captioner] 20:28:16
>> Ms. Gauthier: YOU HAVE 30 

[Captioner] 20:28:16
SECONDS.

[Captioner] 20:28:17
>> I WISH THAT OTHER HOSTS, JUST 

[Captioner] 20:28:18
OUT OF CONSIDERATION, 

[Captioner] 20:28:20
PROFESSIONAL OR WHATEVER 

[Captioner] 20:28:20
CONSIDERATION YOU'D LIKE TO CALL 

[Captioner] 20:28:21
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN HERE TONIGHT, 

[Captioner] 20:28:23
YOU KNOW, YOU'VE ALL MADE THIS 

[Captioner] 20:28:25
SACRIFICE AND PUT ALL THIS WORK 

[Captioner] 20:28:26
INTO IT, AND WHERE IS EVERYONE?

[Captioner] 20:28:29
SO I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT MAYBE 

[Captioner] 20:28:31
EVEN SOMEBODY FROM AIRBNB WOULD 

[Captioner] 20:28:33
HAVE CAME DOWN AND SAID LOOK, 

[Captioner] 20:28:36
I'M FROM AIRBNB, HERE'S THE 

[Captioner] 20:28:36
STATS, ON AND ON.

[Captioner] 20:28:38
I THANK YOU VERY MUCH, HAPPY 

[Captioner] 20:28:38
HOLIDAYS TO YOU ALL.

[Captioner] 20:28:40
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 20:28:41
NEXT SPEAKER.

[Captioner] 20:28:51
>> THIS ORDINANCE COMES TO YOU 

[Captioner] 20:28:54
WITH SO MANY UNJUSTIFIED AND 

[Captioner] 20:28:54
ROSY ASSUMPTIONS.

[Captioner] 20:28:56
FOR EXAMPLE, THE $50,000 A YEAR 

[Captioner] 20:28:59
DIVIDED OUT PER UNIT, THAT'S 

[Captioner] 20:29:00
$140 A YEAR PER UNIT RIGHT 

[Captioner] 20:29:00
THERE.

[Captioner] 20:29:03
NOT DESIGNATED -- NOT COVERED IN 

[Captioner] 20:29:04
THE BUDGET, RIGHT?

[Captioner] 20:29:06
I KNOW SOMEBODY WHO LIVES NEXT 

[Captioner] 20:29:07
DOOR TO ONE OF THESE IN ANOTHER 

[Captioner] 20:29:08
EAST BAY CITY, NOT HERE, AND SHE 

[Captioner] 20:29:12
HAD WATCHED THEM PUT IN FOUR -- 

[Captioner] 20:29:13
SUBDIVIDE THE HOUSE INTO FOUR 

[Captioner] 20:29:14
UNITS AND EACH ONE HAS A NUMBER 

[Captioner] 20:29:17
ON THE DOOR AND WATCHED SO MANY 

[Captioner] 20:29:19
PEOPLE PARKING AND THEN THEY 

[Captioner] 20:29:22
PAVED THE FRONT YARD, SO MANY 

[Captioner] 20:29:22
PEOPLE PARKING IN FRONT.

[Captioner] 20:29:24
AND THEN WHEN SHE GOES TO CODE 

[Captioner] 20:29:25
ENFORCEMENT IN HER CITY, THEY 

[Captioner] 20:29:29
SAY, WELL, HOW DO WE KNOW?

[Captioner] 20:29:31
THEY'RE COMPLETELY MYSTIFIED, 

[Captioner] 20:29:33
HOW DO WE PROVE THAT THAT'S A 

[Captioner] 20:29:34
SHORT-TERM RENTAL?

[Captioner] 20:29:39
SO THE ECONOMIC GAIN FOR 

[Captioner] 20:29:40
RESIDENTS, THAT IS AN EXACT 

[Captioner] 20:29:41
QUOTE THAT WE JUST HEARD.

[Captioner] 20:29:42
ECONOMIC GAIN FOR RESIDENTS.

[Captioner] 20:29:45
WELL, THE OWNER OF THAT 

[Captioner] 20:29:46
PARTICULAR UNIT LIVES IN LOS 

[Captioner] 20:29:46
ANGELES.

[Captioner] 20:29:47
IT'S THAT GUY -- YOU REMEMBER 

[Captioner] 20:29:50
THE GUY WHO'S RENTING OUT SPACE 

[Captioner] 20:29:50
UNDERNEATH THE FREEWAY AND 

[Captioner] 20:29:51
BURNED DOWN THE WHOLE FREEWAY?

[Captioner] 20:29:53
IT'S THAT GUY.

[Captioner] 20:29:57
THAT SPECIFIC GUY OWNS THAT 

[Captioner] 20:29:58
RENTAL -- SHORT TERM RENTAL OVER 

[Captioner] 20:30:00
THERE IN ANOTHER EAST BAY CITY.

[Captioner] 20:30:02
SO YOU KNOW, LET'S TALK ABOUT 

[Captioner] 20:30:03
WHAT'S ALREADY HAPPENING ELSEWHERE.

[Captioner] 20:30:06
CITY OF LOS ANGELES HAS A 

[Captioner] 20:30:08
SHORT-TERM RENTAL ORDINANCE.

[Captioner] 20:30:12
THEY BEGAN THIS LAW AND A NEW 

[Captioner] 20:30:16
STUDY SUGGESTS

[Captioner] 20:30:20
 REPORT WRITTEN BY

[Captioner] 20:30:22
 McGIL 

[Captioner] 20:30:23
PLANNING PROFESSOR, APPLY TO BE 

[Captioner] 20:30:25
OUT OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE 

[Captioner] 20:30:28
CITY'S HOME SHARING ORDINANCE.

[Captioner] 20:30:30
LOS ANGELES AS A NUMBER OF 

[Captioner] 20:30:32
CITIES SHORT TERM RENTAL RULES 

[Captioner] 20:30:34
WHICH ON PAPER LOOK VERY GOOD 

[Captioner] 20:30:35
BUT WHAT I FIND IN PRACTICE WHEN 

[Captioner] 20:30:39
I DIG INTO THE DATA IS L.A.'S 

[Captioner] 20:30:42
RULES ARE NOT BEING ENFORCED 

[Captioner] 20:30:43
EFFECTIVELY.

[Captioner] 20:30:44
NEARLY HALF OUT OF COMPLIANCE.

[Captioner] 20:30:46
CITY COULD HAVE COLLECTED ABOUT 

[Captioner] 20:30:48
$300 MILLION IN FINES LAST YEAR 

[Captioner] 20:30:51
DUE TO VIOLATIONS BUT IT LEVIED 

[Captioner] 20:30:52
LESS THAN $40,000 IN FINES 

[Captioner] 20:30:53
DURING THAT TIME.

[Captioner] 20:30:56
SHORT TERM RENTALS THERE HAVE 

[Captioner] 20:30:58
TAKEN ABOUT 2500 HOMES OFF THE 

[Captioner] 20:31:00
MARKET FOR LONG TERM RESIDENTS 

[Captioner] 20:31:02
AND THIS KIND -- I'M SURE THEY 

[Captioner] 20:31:04
HAD ROSY ASSUMPTIONS AND STAFF 

[Captioner] 20:31:07
SITTING THERE AND TELLING THEM 

[Captioner] 20:31:09
CITY COUNCIL HEY WE GOT THIS NEW 

[Captioner] 20:31:12
LAW HERE'S HOW WE'RE GOING TO DO 

[Captioner] 20:31:14
IT AND THERE IS NO, NO REASON TO 

[Captioner] 20:31:16
ASSUME THAT ANY OF THIS WITH NO 

[Captioner] 20:31:17
BUDGET NO ENFORCEMENT NO STAFF 

[Captioner] 20:31:21
AND NO WAY TO REALLY KNOW WHO IS 

[Captioner] 20:31:23
RUNNING THESE THINGS, WHERE ARE 

[Captioner] 20:31:25
THEY, WHAT IS THE SHORT TERM 

[Captioner] 20:31:26
RENTAL, HOW ARE YOU ACTUALLY 

[Captioner] 20:31:29
GOING TO GET IN THERE, DO YOU 

[Captioner] 20:31:30
HAVE INSPECTION RIGHTS TO GO 

[Captioner] 20:31:32
POUND THE DOORS AND INSPECT HOW 

[Captioner] 20:31:33
MANY UNITS ARE IN THERE, 

[Captioner] 20:31:35
WHATEVER, ALL THESE THINGS THAT 

[Captioner] 20:31:36
THEY'RE EXPERIENCING IN LOS 

[Captioner] 20:31:37
ANGELES, WE'RE GOING TO 

[Captioner] 20:31:39
EXPERIENCE HERE BECAUSE OUR 

[Captioner] 20:31:41
ENFORCEMENT IS NONEXISTENT AS 

[Captioner] 20:31:42
YOU JUST HEARD.

[Captioner] 20:31:48
THANKS.

[Captioner] 20:31:49
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 20:31:51
IS THAT THE LAST SPEAKER?

[Captioner] 20:31:52
>> The Clerk:   YES.

[Captioner] 20:31:53
>> Mayor Mei:   I'D LIKE TO 

[Captioner] 20:31:54
CLOSE THE PUBLIC COMMENT AT THIS 

[Captioner] 20:31:56
TIME AND I'LL TURN IT BACK IF 

[Captioner] 20:31:57
THERE IS ANY OTHER COUNCIL 

[Captioner] 20:32:00
COMMENTS OTHERWISE I'M GOING TO 

[Captioner] 20:32:00
GO AHEAD COUNCILMEMBER KENG YOU 

[Captioner] 20:32:02
THE WANT TO MAKE A MOTION OR DID 

[Captioner] 20:32:03
YOU HAVE A COMMENT?

[Captioner] 20:32:04
AND I HAVE COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN 

[Captioner] 20:32:05
TOO ON THE QUEUE.

[Captioner] 20:32:08
COUNCILMEMBER KENG.

[Captioner] 20:32:13
DID YOU HAVE -- WANT TO -- 

[Captioner] 20:32:13
OKAY.

[Captioner] 20:32:14
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN.

[Captioner] 20:32:17
>> Councilmember Salwan:   THANK 

[Captioner] 20:32:19
YOU MADAM MAYOR AND THANK YOU 

[Captioner] 20:32:21
FOR THE GREAT WORK, I KNOW IT'S 

[Captioner] 20:32:23
BEEN A LONG TIME COMING, I'VE 

[Captioner] 20:32:24
BEEN HEARING ABOUT THIS FOR A 

[Captioner] 20:32:26
LONG TIME AND I KNOW CODE 

[Captioner] 20:32:27
ENFORCEMENT IS ALWAYS A 

[Captioner] 20:32:27
DIFFICULT JOB.

[Captioner] 20:32:29
SO I UNDERSTAND THAT WE'LL NOT 

[Captioner] 20:32:30
BE ABLE TO ENFORCE EVERYTHING 

[Captioner] 20:32:32
BUT I THINK IT GIVES US SOME 

[Captioner] 20:32:33
TEETH.

[Captioner] 20:32:35
IN CASE THERE ARE SOME SERIOUS 

[Captioner] 20:32:36
 

[Captioner] 20:32:38
OFFENDERS THAT WE CAN, YOU KNOW, 

[Captioner] 20:32:39
GO AFTER IF NEEDED.

[Captioner] 20:32:44
I THINK IT'S A GOOD COMPROMISE.

[Captioner] 20:32:48
ONE OF THE BIG ISSUES THAT THESE

[Captioner] 20:32:48
 

[Captioner] 20:32:51
AIRBNBS TAKE A SUPPLY OF HOUSING 

[Captioner] 20:32:53
THAT COULD BE USED FOR LOCAL, 

[Captioner] 20:32:55
RENTING OR PURCHASING SO I THINK 

[Captioner] 20:32:57
THAT'S A HUGE IMPACT THAT 

[Captioner] 20:32:59
PROBABLY HAS NOT BEEN PROPERLY 

[Captioner] 20:33:03
CALCULATED SO I DO THINK THAT

[Captioner] 20:33:09
 

[Captioner] 20:33:10
KEEPING SOME BENEFIT BUT THEY 

[Captioner] 20:33:12
HAVE A HOST ON SITE THAT CAN 

[Captioner] 20:33:14
PREVENT SOME ISSUES WHERE IT 

[Captioner] 20:33:18
COMES TO AIRBNB PARTY VIOLATIONS 

[Captioner] 20:33:19
OR OTHER VIOLATIONS.

[Captioner] 20:33:21
ALSO IT PRESERVES KIND OF 

[Captioner] 20:33:22
NEIGHBORHOOD CHARACTER, PEOPLE 

[Captioner] 20:33:23
DON'T FEEL LIKE PEOPLE ARE 

[Captioner] 20:33:25
COMING IN AND OUT EVERY DAY.

[Captioner] 20:33:27
THE CONCERN I HAVE IS ABOUT THE 

[Captioner] 20:33:29
CITY EXPENDING FUNDS FOR THIS.

[Captioner] 20:33:31
I PERSONALLY WOULD BE OKAY IF WE 

[Captioner] 20:33:34
CHARGED, YOU KNOW, COST NEUTRAL, 

[Captioner] 20:33:36
COVERS THE COST OF ENFORCEMENT 

[Captioner] 20:33:37
OR MANAGEMENT OR WHATEVER, THAT 

[Captioner] 20:33:39
WE CAN DIVIDE BY THE NUMBER OF 

[Captioner] 20:33:40
HOSTS, RATHER THAN THE CITY 

[Captioner] 20:33:43
FRONT THE COST.

[Captioner] 20:33:45
YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE 

[Captioner] 20:33:47
FEE WOULD BE PER UNIT BUT I'M 

[Captioner] 20:33:48
SURE IT COULD BE ROLLED INTO 

[Captioner] 20:33:49
THAT.

[Captioner] 20:33:51
SO I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS AND 

[Captioner] 20:33:54
LOOK FORWARD TO GETTING FEEDBACK 

[Captioner] 20:33:56
FROM YOU AS WE PROGRESS FURTHER 

[Captioner] 20:33:56
SO THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 20:33:58
I'D LIKE TO MOVE THAT FORWARD.

[Captioner] 20:33:59
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU AND I 

[Captioner] 20:34:00
SEE A SECOND BY COUNCILMEMBER 

[Captioner] 20:34:01
KENG.

[Captioner] 20:34:04
IS THAT --

[Captioner] 20:34:05
>> Councilmember Keng:   CAN I 

[Captioner] 20:34:07
MAKE A QUICK COMMENT?

[Captioner] 20:34:08
>> Mayor Mei:   THEN I'LL WRAP 

[Captioner] 20:34:10
UP AND CALL THE VOTE.

[Captioner] 20:34:11
>> Councilmember Keng:   I'M 

[Captioner] 20:34:13
ALSO SUPPORTIVE ADDING A COST 

[Captioner] 20:34:14
PER PERMIT.

[Captioner] 20:34:16
BECAUSE I KNOW WITH STR RENTING 

[Captioner] 20:34:18
IT'S A LOT MORE PROFITABLE FOR 

[Captioner] 20:34:19
THE HOST BECAUSE THEY ARE 

[Captioner] 20:34:22
RENTING IT DAILY, OR UP TO A 

[Captioner] 20:34:25
MONTH, AND SO I THINK THEY -- WE 

[Captioner] 20:34:26
SHOULD, YOU KNOW, IN ORDER TO 

[Captioner] 20:34:29
GAIN MORE LONG TERM HOUSING 

[Captioner] 20:34:32
SUPPLY BACK, IT IS IS REASONABLE 

[Captioner] 20:34:36
TO ASK FOR A PERMIT FEE.

[Captioner] 20:34:38
AND SO I WOULD BE SUPPORTIVE IN 

[Captioner] 20:34:43
KIND OF WHEN WE HAVE A

[Captioner] 20:34:43
 IDEA HOW 

[Captioner] 20:34:45
MUCH THE COST WOULD BE FOR THE 

[Captioner] 20:34:46
PROGRAM I THINK IT IS REASONABLE 

[Captioner] 20:34:49
TO ASK FOR SOMEONE TO, BECAUSE I 

[Captioner] 20:34:51
KNOW THAT, YOU KNOW, IF PEOPLE 

[Captioner] 20:34:55
COULD RENT OUT, YOU KNOW, LIKE 

[Captioner] 20:34:57
FOR HOWEVER MANY ROOMS THEIR 

[Captioner] 20:34:59
HOMES ARE, IT -- THEY WOULD HAVE 

[Captioner] 20:35:01
LIKE A NUMBER KEY ON THEIR DOOR, 

[Captioner] 20:35:03
ON EACH ROOM'S DOOR AND PEOPLE 

[Captioner] 20:35:07
CAN GET IN AND STUFF LIKE THAT.

[Captioner] 20:35:08
SO IT'S A LOT MORE PROFITABLE 

[Captioner] 20:35:10
THAN RENTING, YOU KNOW, THE 

[Captioner] 20:35:12
WHOLE HOUSE OUT, ON A LONG TERM 

[Captioner] 20:35:16
LEASE AND SO I THINK IT WOULD 

[Captioner] 20:35:18
SUPPORT THAT FEE STRUCTURE.

[Captioner] 20:35:21
AND I WOULD BE HAPPY TO SECOND.

[Captioner] 20:35:22
>> Mayor Mei:   OKAY I HAVE A 

[Captioner] 20:35:23
MOTION AND SECOND.

[Captioner] 20:35:25
I WOULD LIKE TO -- I DON'T THINK 

[Captioner] 20:35:27
THERE IS ANY OTHER COMMENTS AT 

[Captioner] 20:35:27
THIS TIME.

[Captioner] 20:35:29
I'LL MAKE MY COMMENT REAL 

[Captioner] 20:35:31
QUICKLY, IS THAT I THINK THIS IS 

[Captioner] 20:35:32
IMPORTANT FOR US, WE ALREADY 

[Captioner] 20:35:36
HAVE FROM YOUR MAP ALREADY SHORT 

[Captioner] 20:35:37
TERM RENTALS OUT THERE AND THIS 

[Captioner] 20:35:39
WILL PROVIDE A GREATER FRAMEWORK 

[Captioner] 20:35:40
AND STRUCTURE AND FROM WHAT I 

[Captioner] 20:35:43
CAN SEE NATIONALLY THE CITIES 

[Captioner] 20:35:44
CREATED A GUIDE THAT CAME OUT 

[Captioner] 20:35:47
EARLIER AND THAT'S WHAT THIS 

[Captioner] 20:35:48
FOUNDATIONAL INFORMATION, IT 

[Captioner] 20:35:49
CREATES A STRUCTURE FOR US TO 

[Captioner] 20:35:50
LOOK AT.

[Captioner] 20:35:52
I WILL NOTE THAT PER SOME OF THE 

[Captioner] 20:35:53
SPEAKERS AND OTHER COMMENTS I 

[Captioner] 20:35:55
KNOW THAT EVERY CITY HAS MADE 

[Captioner] 20:35:58
SOME MODIFICATION OF THAT, FOR 

[Captioner] 20:35:59
INSTANCE L.A. I BELIEVE THEY 

[Captioner] 20:36:01
HAVE THINGS LIKE THERE IS A 

[Captioner] 20:36:02
POLICE PERMIT FEE.

[Captioner] 20:36:05
AND IN SOME CITIES THEY'VE EVEN 

[Captioner] 20:36:09
BANNED AIRBNB STRAIGHT OUT SUCH 

[Captioner] 20:36:11
AS RE DON DOE BEACH OR SOME 

[Captioner] 20:36:12
OTHER AREAS.

[Captioner] 20:36:14
THIS IS A HAPPY MEDIUM FOR US.

[Captioner] 20:36:17
WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT WHEN THE 

[Captioner] 20:36:18
CONTRACT COMES THROUGH, IN THE 

[Captioner] 20:36:20
PAST WE WERE SHORTER STAFFED 

[Captioner] 20:36:21
PREVIOUSLY IN CODE ENFORCEMENT 

[Captioner] 20:36:23
AND NOW WE ARE ABLE TO HAVE MORE 

[Captioner] 20:36:24
ROBUST SERVICES AND SUPPORT FOR 

[Captioner] 20:36:26
THAT WHICH IS MUCH NEEDED 

[Captioner] 20:36:27
BECAUSE OF THE DIFFERENT ISSUES 

[Captioner] 20:36:28
THAT HAVE COME UP.

[Captioner] 20:36:29
I'M SUPPORTIVE OF THAT.

[Captioner] 20:36:31
I HEARD A MOTION FROM 

[Captioner] 20:36:32
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN A SECOND BY 

[Captioner] 20:36:33
COUNCILMEMBER KENG, I'D LIKE TO 

[Captioner] 20:36:38
CALL THE VOTE.

[Captioner] 20:36:39
>> Councilmember Campbell:   I 

[Captioner] 20:36:41
HAD RAISED MY HAND, I DIDN'T 

[Captioner] 20:36:42
THINK YOU SAW IT BEFORE YOU DO 

[Captioner] 20:36:43
THE VOTE.

[Captioner] 20:36:45
I JUST WANTED TO SORT OF ECHO 

[Captioner] 20:36:47
THE FEE THING BECAUSE THAT WAS 

[Captioner] 20:36:49
ONE OF MY QUESTIONS EARLY ON AS 

[Captioner] 20:36:49
WELL.

[Captioner] 20:36:52
AND THEN I THINK WASN'T THERE A 

[Captioner] 20:36:55
ONE YEAR RAMP UP?

[Captioner] 20:36:58
BEFORE WE WERE ABLE TO REALLY GO 

[Captioner] 20:37:00
FULL THROTTLE ON THIS?

[Captioner] 20:37:03
CAN YOU JUST BRIEFLY, I'M SORRY, 

[Captioner] 20:37:06
HELP US UNDERSTAND THIS ONE-YEAR 

[Captioner] 20:37:10
RAMP UP PIECE?

>> Dan Schoenholz:   YES YOU ARE 

[Captioner] 20:37:21
CORRECT COUNCILMEMBER

[Captioner] 20:37:22

[Captioner] 20:37:28
AND THE ORDINANCE HAS A ONE YEAR 

[Captioner] 20:37:33

THE HOST TO GET IN ACCORDANCE
