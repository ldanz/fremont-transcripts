GOOD EVENING, COUNCILMEMBERS,

[Captioner] 19:19:44

MS. MAYOR, CITIZENS OF FREMONT.


[Captioner] 19:19:48
I SERVE AS THE PASTOR OF
LIGHTHOUSE BIBLE FELLOWSHIP IN

[Captioner] 19:19:49

FREMONT, CALIFORNIA.


[Captioner] 19:19:53
I AND MY FAMILY MOVED HERE IN
JANUARY OF 2022

[Captioner] 19:19:56
 ACCEPTING THE
CALL TO LEAD A THRIVING CHURCH


[Captioner] 19:19:58
BACK TO HEALTH IN THE AFTERMATH
OF COVID-19.


[Captioner] 19:20:03
WE HAVE TWO LITTLE GIRLS.
WE RAISE FAMILIES AND

[Captioner] 19:20:04
 HELP
FAMILIES WHO RAISE CHILDREN IN


[Captioner] 19:20:07
OUR CITY.
WE'VE BEEN

[Captioner] 19:20:11
 FAMILIAR WITH
SAN FRANCISCO AND

[Captioner] 19:20:14
 THE BAY AREA,
WE'VE LIVED HERE FOR YEARS, WE


[Captioner] 19:20:15
RETURNED AFTER A 10-YEAR STINT
AWAY.


[Captioner] 19:20:18
WE HAVE LITTLE GIRLS

[Captioner] 19:20:19

THAT ARE 5 AND 9 # YEARS OLD.


[Captioner] 19:20:23
WE'VE BEEN LOOKING TO THE BROAD
BASED BENEFITS OF

[Captioner] 19:20:26
 RAISING OUR
GIRLS IN A DIVERSE CITY WHERE IN

[Captioner] 19:20:30

COMMERCE, ACADEMIC AND CIVIC

[Captioner] 19:20:31

CLASSIC LIBERALISM SEEM TO BE


[Captioner] 19:20:33
FLOURISHING, AFFORDING OUR
CHILDREN THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT


[Captioner] 19:20:34
COME FROM LIVING IN SILICON
VALLEY.


[Captioner] 19:20:39
IN THE YEAR THAT WE HAVE TAKEN
TO REACQUAINT OURSELVES WITH THE


[Captioner] 19:20:42
AREA, I'VE INVESTED A LARGE
PORTION OF MY TIME TO IGNITE


[Captioner] 19:20:45
HOPE AND POSSIBILITY FOR THE
WAYS IN WHICH OUR CHURCH


[Captioner] 19:20:48
COMMUNITY COULD BRING THE LIGHT
AND THE LOVE OF CHRIST TO OUR

[Captioner] 19:20:51

CITIZENS, KNOWING THAT GRACE AND


[Captioner] 19:20:53
THE COMPASSION OF OUR RISEN
KING, JESUS, IS FOR EVERYONE.


[Captioner] 19:20:58
TO THAT END, WE HAVE
FAMILIARIZED OURSELF WITH CITY

[Captioner] 19:21:01

SERVE, COMPASSION NETWORK,


[Captioner] 19:21:05
ENGAGING AFTER GUANINE REFUGEES
WITH HELP, HELPING HOMELESS

[Captioner] 19:21:07

PEOPLE, GOING TO THE SAFE


[Captioner] 19:21:11
PARKING MEETING, GOING TO COFFEE
WITH COPS,

[Captioner] 19:21:14
 ENGAGING FULLY WITH
THIS CITY AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE

[Captioner] 19:21:17
.
TO BE SURE THE CITY OF FREMONT


[Captioner] 19:21:20
PROVIDES A GREAT FIRST
IMPRESSION TO VISITORS AND NEW


[Captioner] 19:21:22
RESIDENTS ALIKE.
THERE ARE APPARENTLY A GREAT


[Captioner] 19:21:26
MANY WAYS TO ENGAGE THE STRICTLY

[Captioner] 19:21:27

BUREAUCRATICALLY CONTROLLED


[Captioner] 19:21:30
MECHANISMS THAT APPARENTLY SEEK
TO MAINTAIN A STERILE FACADE OF

[Captioner] 19:21:32

COLLECTIVE SAFETY IN FREMONT.


[Captioner] 19:21:38
HOWEVER, WITHIN SUCH A
MASTERFULLY ENGINEERED INSULATED

[Captioner] 19:21:40

SUBURB HAS CREATED A CHALLENGE


[Captioner] 19:21:43
FOR SOMEONE LIKE ME WHO STRIVES
ZEALOUSLY TO INCULCATE OUR


[Captioner] 19:21:47
CHILDREN WITH FOUNDATIONAL
GOD-ORDAINED

[Captioner] 19:21:49
 PRINCIPLES FOR
LIVING IN AND PROTECTING THE


[Captioner] 19:21:52
HUMAN FREEDOMS CONFERRED UPON BY
US IN OUR UNITED STATES


[Captioner] 19:21:55
CONSTITUTION.
I REGULARLY REMIND OUR CHILDREN


[Captioner] 19:21:58
THAT WE ARE MERELY THE STEWARDS
OF ALL THAT IS GOOD

[Captioner] 19:22:00
 AND RIGHT
AND TRUE AND BEAUTIFUL.


[Captioner] 19:22:04
IT IS THE LORD GOD ALMIGHTY WHO
WAS THE ULTIMATE AUTHORITY OF


[Captioner] 19:22:07
ALL THE CREATORS OF TRUTH.
DOES THAT

[Captioner] 19:22:10
 MEAN MY TIME IS UP?
>> Mayor Mei: YOU

[Captioner] 19:22:12
 HAVE
30 SECONDS STILL, SIR.


[Captioner] 19:22:15
>> I WILL SKIP AHEAD.
I DON'T EXPECT THAT THE GODLESS

[Captioner] 19:22:17

BUREAUCRATS WITHIN ANY SECULAR


[Captioner] 19:22:21
CIVIC FRAMEWORK WOULD CARE ABOUT
THE MORALS OF A FAITH-BASED --


[Captioner] 19:22:23
OF THEIR FAITH-BASED
CONSTITUENTS.


[Captioner] 19:22:26
ESPECIALLY IN A WAY THAT WOULD
PROMOTE THE CAUSE

[Captioner] 19:22:30
 OF FLYING A
CHRISTIAN FLAG OR MUSLIM FLAG OR


[Captioner] 19:22:33
ANY OTHER FLAG ON A CITY HALL
STAN

[Captioner] 19:22:40
TION, HOWEVER YOU HAVE CHOSE
ENA SIDE AND

[Captioner] 19:22:41
 IDEALS AND THOSE
IDEALS ARE GODLESS.


[Captioner] 19:22:42
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU SO
MUCH.


[Captioner] 19:22:45
IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE A CHANCE TO
SHARE YOUR STATEMENT, YOU MAY


[Captioner] 19:22:48
LEAVE IT WITH THE CITY CLERK AND

[Captioner] 19:22:50

WE WILL DISTRIBUTE TO OUR


[Captioner] 19:22:51
COUNCIL.
>> Mr. Quintanilla: OUR NEXT


[Captioner] 19:22:55
SPEAKER IS KELLY ABREU.


[Captioner] 19:23:00
>> WELL, I DON'T WANT TO SOUND
LIKE A PREACHER BUT THE IDEALS


[Captioner] 19:23:03
AND THE MORALS OF A CITY ARE SET
IN CONCRETE

[Captioner] 19:23:07
 WHEN THEY

[Captioner] 19:23:11
 DESIGN
THEIR STREETS, AND WHEN THEY

[Captioner] 19:23:13

ESTABLISH OR ERADICATE HOMELESS


[Captioner] 19:23:16
ENCAMPMENTS AND TRUCKING
SLEEPING AREAS AND TRUCKING

[Captioner] 19:23:18

CARGO PARKING ZONES.


[Captioner] 19:23:22
AND ON KATO ROAD, THIS

[Captioner] 19:23:24
 HAPPENED,
QUITE -- WITH HUGE COVERAGE A


[Captioner] 19:23:27
COUPLE OF YEARS AGO IN THE
NEWSPAPER, SEVERAL STORIES


[Captioner] 19:23:30
EXPLAINING THE DETAILS OF WHAT
WAS GOING ON THERE FROM

[Captioner] 19:23:31
 A HUMAN
PERSPECTIVE.


[Captioner] 19:23:35
BUT FROM THE ENGINEER

[Captioner] 19:23:38

ENGINEERING PERSPECTIVE OF


[Captioner] 19:23:42
WHEN YOU PUT BOULDERS ON A
STREET AND IT RIGHT IN FRONT OF


[Captioner] 19:23:45
A CURB SO THAT THE DEFAULT
ACTION OF

[Captioner] 19:23:49
 THE -- OF A DRIVER WHO
DOES NOTHING AND DOESN'T TURN

[Captioner] 19:23:52

THE STEERING WHEEL

[Captioner] 19:23:54
 IS TO
DRIVE INTO A FIELD OF BOULDERS


[Captioner] 19:23:57
AND THESE ARE NOT MARKED, THESE
DO NOT HAVE LIGHTS ON THEM,

[Captioner] 19:23:58

REFLECTORS.


[Captioner] 19:24:00
THESE ARE THERE IN THE DARK OR
IN THE LIGHT OR MAYBE SOMEBODY


[Captioner] 19:24:03
IS ASLEEP.
THEN THE CITY

[Captioner] 19:24:06
 STAFF LIKES TO
BLAME THE VICTIM, YOU KNOW, WE


[Captioner] 19:24:08
HEARD ABOUT COMPASSIONATE CITY.
THIS IS THE OPPOSITE.


[Captioner] 19:24:11
THIS IS THE

[Captioner] 19:24:14
 VICTIM -- VICTIM --
BLAME THE VICTIM CITY.


[Captioner] 19:24:17
WE HAVE, YOU KNOW, THESE PEOPLE
ARE DISTRACTED,

[Captioner] 19:24:20
 THEY'RE DRUNK,
THEY'RE SPEEDING

[Captioner] 19:24:22
, THEY ARE NOT
DESERVING OF PROTECTION.


[Captioner] 19:24:25
BUT THAT'S WHY GUARDRAILS ARE
PUT IN.


[Captioner] 19:24:29
GUARDRAILS ARE A

[Captioner] 19:24:32
 METAPHOR AND
THEY'RE A PHYSICAL REALITY,


[Captioner] 19:24:36
OKAY?
WE NEED GUARDRAILS IN SOCIETY

[Captioner] 19:24:38
 TO
PROTECT THOSE WHO ARE TRYING TO


[Captioner] 19:24:41
WANDER AND WOULD CAUSE
THEMSELVES OR OTHERS GREAT


[Captioner] 19:24:43
DAMAGE.
THIS CITY KNOWS HOW TO PUT IN


[Captioner] 19:24:46
GUARDRAILS.
YOU PUT THEM IN ON GRIMMER


[Captioner] 19:24:48
ROAD.
REMEMBER WHERE EVERYBODY WAS


[Captioner] 19:24:49
DRIVING INTO PEOPLE'S
BACKYARDS?


[Captioner] 19:24:51
ALL OF A SUDDEN GUARDRAILS
APPEARED.


[Captioner] 19:24:54
YOU PUT THEM IN ON BOSCELL

[Captioner] 19:24:58
 ROAD
NEAR STEWART,

[Captioner] 19:25:02
 GIANT YELLOW
BARRIERS TO BLOCK OFF PARKING,


[Captioner] 19:25:04
BUT THEY'RE IN PLASTIC.
IF YOU HIT THEM, IT PERFECTLY


[Captioner] 19:25:07
SAFE.
THIS CITY KNOWS HOW TO DESIGN

[Captioner] 19:25:08

SAFEGUARD RAILS.


[Captioner] 19:25:13
BUT IT HAS CHOSEN TO GO THE
OTHER WAY, TO PUT

[Captioner] 19:25:15
 IN MINEFIELDS,
AND TO BLAME THE VICTIM.


[Captioner] 19:25:20
YOU SHOULD THINK ABOUT THE NEED
FOR GUARDRAILS.


[Captioner] 19:25:24
THE METAPHORICAL NEED

[Captioner] 19:25:25
 AND THE
PHYSICAL REALITY NEED.


[Captioner] 19:25:31
THANK YOU.
>> Mr. Quintanilla: WE HAVE


[Captioner] 19:25:34
ONE HAND RAISED IN ZOOM.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:25:36
>> Mr. Quintanilla: JOHN
HINDS.


[Captioner] 19:25:39
>> Mayor Mei: WELCOME, JOHN.
>> HELLO, EVERYONE.


[Captioner] 19:25:42
NEXT MONTH, FREMONT'S MINIMUM
WAGE IS GOING UP

[Captioner] 19:25:43
 AND I'M
EXCITED.


[Captioner] 19:25:47
AS EVERYONE KNOWS, WE CAN JUST
CHANGE A COUPLE OF NUMBERS ON

[Captioner] 19:25:49

THE CITY'S WEBSITE AND THAT WILL


[Captioner] 19:25:52
BRING INCREASED PROSPERITY AND
LIVING STANDARDS.


[Captioner] 19:25:55
BUT SINCE EVERYONE KNOWS THERE
ARE NO DOWN SIDES TO

[Captioner] 19:25:57
 THIS, I'M
PUZZLED THAT WE'RE BEING SO


[Captioner] 19:26:00
WIMPY ABOUT IT AND STOPPING AT
16.80.


[Captioner] 19:26:03
WHY NOT BE BOLD?
LET'S GO

[Captioner] 19:26:04
 FOR A THOUSAND DOLLARS
AN HOUR.


[Captioner] 19:26:08
THINK ABOUT IT.
AT THAT RATE, EACH OF US, WELL,

[Captioner] 19:26:10

EACH OF US WHO STILL HAVE WORK,


[Captioner] 19:26:12
WOULD BE MAKING $2 MILLION A
YEAR.


[Captioner] 19:26:16
WE'D ALL BE RICH, AND ALL WE'D
HAVE TO DO TO MAKE

[Captioner] 19:26:17
 IT HAPPEN IS
JUST VOTE FOR IT.


[Captioner] 19:26:21
WHAT COULD GO WRONG?
WELL, IN MY

[Captioner] 19:26:25
 CASE, I'D GET ZERO
BECAUSE AIN'T NOBODY GOING

[Captioner] 19:26:28
 TO
PAY $1,000 FOR AN

[Captioner] 19:26:28
 HOUR OF MY
WORK.


[Captioner] 19:26:30
MOST PEOPLE WOULD BE IN THE SAME
BOAT.


[Captioner] 19:26:32
OKAY, SO WHAT ABOUT $100 AN
HOUR?


[Captioner] 19:26:35
AT THAT RATE, QUITE A FEW PEOPLE
WOULD BE ABOVE THE LINE

[Captioner] 19:26:37
 ALREADY
AND UNAFFECTED BY IT, BUT MOST


[Captioner] 19:26:40
PEOPLE ARE BELOW THAT LINE NOW,
AND THEY'D BE

[Captioner] 19:26:41
 UNEMPLOYED AT
BROKE.


[Captioner] 19:26:43
DOESN'T SOUND LIKE A GREAT WAY
TO RAISE LIVING STANDARDS.


[Captioner] 19:26:48
IF WE WORK OUR WAY DOWNWARD
THROUGH A FEW MORE

[Captioner] 19:26:51
 SCENARIOS OF
$50, 25, 15 AND SO ON, WE'LL

[Captioner] 19:26:54
 SEE
A VERY SIMILAR PICTURE PLAYING


[Captioner] 19:26:57
OUT EACH TIME WITH THE
DIFFERENCE BEING THAT AT THE


[Captioner] 19:27:00
LOWER RATES, THERE ARE MORE
PEOPLE ALREADY ABOVE THE LINE


[Captioner] 19:27:03
WHO WOULD BE UNAFFECTED AND
FEWER PEOPLE BELOW THE LINE

[Captioner] 19:27:05

WHO'D BE SCREWED BY IT.


[Captioner] 19:27:09
BUT IN THE RANGE OF 15 TO $17
WE'RE

[Captioner] 19:27:11
 TALKING ABOUT NOW, THE
PEOPLE WHOSE WORK PROSPECTS


[Captioner] 19:27:14
WOULD BE DIMMED BY IT ARE THOSE
WHO

[Captioner] 19:27:17
 ARE JUST GRASPING THAT

[Captioner] 19:27:20
 FIRST
RUNG ON THE ECONOMIC LADDER.


[Captioner] 19:27:23
MANY WILL SEE THEIR HOURS CUT
BACK, A FEW WILL BE

[Captioner] 19:27:26
 LET GO AND A
FEW WON'T BE HIRED.


[Captioner] 19:27:28
THEY'LL MISS OUT ON AN IMPORTANT
EXPERIENCE.


[Captioner] 19:27:31
THE ONLY WAY WE DON'T HURT
ANYONE WITH THIS IS IF

[Captioner] 19:27:34
 WE SET
THE MINIMUM AT ZERO OR JUST


[Captioner] 19:27:36
SCRATCH THE SECTION OUT OF THE
MUNICIPAL CODE ENTIRELY.


[Captioner] 19:27:42
WHEN AN EMPLOYEE AND AN EMPLOYER
AGREE TO A

[Captioner] 19:27:45
 WAGE AND WORKING
ADDITIONS AND

[Captioner] 19:27:48
 RESPONSIBILITIES
AND TIME, THOSE TWO PEOPLE ARE


[Captioner] 19:27:50
THE WORLD'S EXPERTS ON THEIR
CIRCUMSTANCES AND THEIR NEEDS.


[Captioner] 19:27:54
AND THE IDEA THAT SOMEBODY IN A
BACK OFFICE

[Captioner] 19:27:55
 KNOWS BETTER IS
ABSURD.


[Captioner] 19:28:01
NOW YOU MIGHT ASK, IS THERE
ANYONE WHO ACTUALLY BENEFITS


[Captioner] 19:28:05
FROM THE MINIMUM WAGE?
WELL, IT THERE ARE SOME

[Captioner] 19:28:08
 PEOPLE
WHOSE CONTRACTS ARE TIED


[Captioner] 19:28:09
INDIRECTLY TO CHANGES IN THE
MINIMUM WAGE.


[Captioner] 19:28:13
THEY DON'T TALK ABOUT THEMSELVES
MUCH IN THIS,

[Captioner] 19:28:17
 THOUGH.
THEY SEEM TO WANT TO PORTRAY IT


[Captioner] 19:28:20
AS BENEFITING SOMEONE ELSE.
I CAN'T IMAGINE WHY.


[Captioner] 19:28:23
THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:28:26
>> Mr. Quintanilla: THAT WAS
OUR LAST SPEAKER.


[Captioner] 19:28:29
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
AT THIS TIME, I WILL CLOSE


[Captioner] 19:28:33
PUBLIC COMMUNICATIONS, AND I
WILL RETURN TO OUR ITEMS

[Captioner] 19:28:35
 THAT
WERE PULLED FROM THE CONSENT


[Captioner] 19:28:38
CALENDAR.
IF WE CAN CALL, I

[Captioner] 19:28:40
 BELIEVE IT WAS
2C?


[Captioner] 19:28:43
>> Mr. Quintanilla: 2C, YES.
WE HAVE ONE SPEAKER CARD.


[Captioner] 19:28:45
KELLY ABREU.
>> Mayor Mei: WELCOME.


[Captioner] 19:28:58
>> SO WHEN THIS MISSION PEAK
PARKING AND

[Captioner] 19:29:02
 CITYWIDE PARKING
SLIDES WERE

[Captioner] 19:29:05
 PRESENTED HERE A FEW
MONTHS AGO, THERE WAS ONE

[Captioner] 19:29:08


[Captioner] 19:29:10
 SLIDE
ABOUT THE CURRENT OPERATING


[Captioner] 19:29:14
BUDGET THAT SOMEHOW YOU WERE
ABLE TO COVER THE COST OF THREE

[Captioner] 19:29:16

COMMUNITY COMPLIANCE ENFORCEMENT


[Captioner] 19:29:19
OFFICERS, YOU WERE ABLE TO COVER
THEIR COSTS WITH THE ONGOING


[Captioner] 19:29:22
REVENUE, ANNUAL REVENUE FROM
THESE PARKING

[Captioner] 19:29:26
 TICKETS.
WELL, THERE WAS A LITTLE BIT OF


[Captioner] 19:29:27
AN ACCOUNTING FRAUD IN THERE.
WHAT WAS THE FRAUD?


[Captioner] 19:29:30
THE FRAUD WAS THAT YOU HAD
$530,000 OF

[Captioner] 19:29:34
 REVENUE BUT 21% OF
THAT REVENUE, 21% OF

[Captioner] 19:29:37
 THAT
REVENUE WAS BEING GENERATED NOT

[Captioner] 19:29:39

BY THOSE COMPLIANCE PEOPLE, IT


[Captioner] 19:29:43
WAS BEING GENERATED BY THE
PREVIOUSLY EXIST

[Captioner] 19:29:46
ING PEOPLE THAT
YOU HAD THAT WEREN'T HIRED.


[Captioner] 19:29:49
SO YOU'RE TRYING TO SAY -- THE
CLAIM WAS THAT

[Captioner] 19:29:52
 THIS PROGRAM OF
HIRING THREE ADDITIONAL

[Captioner] 19:29:54

COMPLIANCE ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS


[Captioner] 19:29:57
WAS GOING TO BE REVENUE

[Captioner] 19:29:59
 IN
NEUTRAL, THEN YOU TAKE REVENUE


[Captioner] 19:30:01
FROM OTHER PEOPLE, OTHER
PEOPLE'S LABOR, AND YOU BURDEN


[Captioner] 19:30:05
IT ON TO THEM SO THAT -- TO
PRETEND LIKE

[Captioner] 19:30:08
 THESE PEOPLE, THAT
REVENUE WAS GOING TO HELP COVER


[Captioner] 19:30:11
THEIR COSTS.
ONCE YOU TAKE OUT THE 21% OF THE


[Captioner] 19:30:15
REVENUE THAT WOULD BE
COMING FROM THOSE

[Captioner] 19:30:17
 OTHER
EMPLOYEES THAT ARE NOT THE


[Captioner] 19:30:19
COMPLIANCE ONES THAT YOU JUST
HIRED, THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN


[Captioner] 19:30:21
YOU'RE RUNNING A SMALL ANNUAL
DEFICIT.


[Captioner] 19:30:24
THAT'S YOUR FIRST SLIDE.
YOUR SECOND

[Captioner] 19:30:25
 SLIDE, EVEN MORE OF
A FRAUD.


[Captioner] 19:30:30
BECAUSE YOU SAY HEY, YOU KNOW,
WE'RE MAKING ALL

[Captioner] 19:30:33
 THIS MONEY

[Captioner] 19:30:34
,
$530,000 A YEAR.


[Captioner] 19:30:37
YOU FORGET THAT IN 2018

[Captioner] 19:30:41
 AND
2019, YOUR STAFF, WITHOUT ANY

[Captioner] 19:30:43
 OF
THOSE COMPLIANCE OFFICERS, WAS


[Captioner] 19:30:46
PRODUCING $460,000 A YEAR MORE
OR LESS.


[Captioner] 19:30:50
OF PARKING TICKETS.
HOW DID THEY DO THAT?


[Captioner] 19:30:52
BECAUSE THEY WERE OUT THERE
HANDING OUT PARKING TICKETS.


[Captioner] 19:30:56
THEN YOU'D HIRED THREE MORE
PEOPLE THAT COST

[Captioner] 19:30:59
 YOU $360,000 A
YEAR, AND UP, WITH OTHER

[Captioner] 19:31:03
 COSTS,
SO THE NET RESULT OF

[Captioner] 19:31:05
 THIS
PROGRAM IS YOU'RE RUNNING


[Captioner] 19:31:08
ENORMOUSLY IN THE RED.
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS


[Captioner] 19:31:11
A YEAR IN THE RED, BECAUSE
BEFORE YOU WERE ABLE TO PRODUCE

[Captioner] 19:31:12

ALMOST THE SAME AMOUNT OF


[Captioner] 19:31:14
TICKETS.
YOU WERE PRODUCING $60,000 A


[Captioner] 19:31:17
YEAR LESS IN PARKING TICKETS.
THIS IS A HUGE ACCOUNTING


[Captioner] 19:31:20
FRAUD.
AND THEN I JUST WANT TO -- ON


[Captioner] 19:31:24
THIS ITEM, ON THE MISSION PEAK
PARKING, I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT,


[Captioner] 19:31:27
I'M SURE THAT IN THE FUTURE,

[Captioner] 19:31:29

THIS -- MEMBERS OF THIS COUNCIL


[Captioner] 19:31:32
ARE GOING TO FORGET

[Captioner] 19:31:33
 THAT
COUNCILMEMBER YANG SHAO,


[Captioner] 19:31:35
COUNCILMEMBER KENG,
COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL AND MAYOR


[Captioner] 19:31:39
MEI WERE ALL HERE DEMANDING THE

[Captioner] 19:31:40

COMPLETE BAN OF STREET PARKING


[Captioner] 19:31:43
NEAR MISSION PEAK.
THEY WANTED TO OUTLAW IT SO THAT

[Captioner] 19:31:46

THE LOCAL RESIDENTS AND DON'T


[Captioner] 19:31:49
FORGET THE FLIP SIDE OF THIS.
THE FLIP SIDE OF THIS

[Captioner] 19:31:53
 IS, YOU'RE
GIVING FREE PARKING TO THE LOCAL

[Captioner] 19:31:54

RESIDENTS WHO DON'T NEED IT.


[Captioner] 19:31:57
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:32:01
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
AT THIS TIME, ARE THERE ANY


[Captioner] 19:32:04
COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM THE
COUNCIL OR WOULD SOMEONE LIKE TO

[Captioner] 19:32:05

MOVE THIS ITEM?


[Captioner] 19:32:08
AGAIN, THIS IS ITEM

[Captioner] 19:32:09
 2C AS IN
CAT.


[Captioner] 19:32:12
>> Vice Mayor Cox: SO MOVE.


[Captioner] 19:32:15
>> Mayor Mei: MOVED BY VICE
MAYOR COX AND SECONDED BY


[Captioner] 19:32:18
COUNCILMEMBER SHAO.
BEFORE WE MOVE FORWARD, I NEEDED


[Captioner] 19:32:23
TO HAVE THE CITY ATTORNEY
READ IN THE

[Captioner] 19:32:26
 ORDINANCE, PLEASE.
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: THANK

[Captioner] 19:32:27

YOU, MAYOR.


[Captioner] 19:32:28
GOOD EVENING, MAYOR AND
COUNCIL.


[Captioner] 19:32:31
THE TITLE OF THE ORDINANCE IS AN
ORDINANCE OF THE CITY OF FREMONT


[Captioner] 19:32:35
AMENDING CHAPTER 10.05 TRAFFIC
REGULATIONS OF THE FREMONT


[Captioner] 19:32:38
MUNICIPAL CODE TO CONTINUE THE
MISSION PEAK PERMIT PARKING


[Captioner] 19:32:39
PROGRAM.
THANK YOU, MAYOR.


[Captioner] 19:32:44
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
WITH THAT, PLEASE VOTE

[Captioner] 19:32:47
.


[Captioner] 19:32:54
THE MOTION PASSES FOR ITEM 2C
UNANIMOUSLY

[Captioner] 19:32:56
 EXCEPT FOR
COUNCILMEMBER KENG, WHO IS


[Captioner] 19:32:59
ABSENT THIS EVENING.


[Captioner] 19:33:02
NEXT IS ITEM 2I AS IN ICE.


[Captioner] 19:33:06
I BELIEVE THAT WAS PULLED BY
COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL.


[Captioner] 19:33:25
WELCOME, DIRECTOR PERSSELIN.
>> Councilmember Campbell:

[Captioner] 19:33:27

WOULD I JUST ASK MY QUESTIONS OR


[Captioner] 19:33:29
IS THE DIRECTOR GOING TO HAVE
SOMETHING TO SAY FIRST?


[Captioner] 19:33:31
WERE YOU GOING TO SAY SOMETHING
FIRST?


[Captioner] 19:33:33
>> Mayor Mei: HE HAS A
PRESENTATION IF YOU'D LIKE TO


[Captioner] 19:33:37
SEE THE PRESENTATION.


[Captioner] 19:33:39
>> City Mgr. Shackelford: HE
CAN MAKE SOME VERBAL COMMENTS


[Captioner] 19:33:43
AND PROVIDE A GENERAL OVERVIEW
OF THE ITEM AND IF THERE'S STILL


[Captioner] 19:33:44
QUESTIONS, YOU CAN PROCEED
THEN.


[Captioner] 19:33:45
>> Councilmember Campbell:
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:33:49
>> Mr. Persselin: GOOD
EVENING, MAYOR AND COUNCIL.


[Captioner] 19:33:52
SO TONIGHT'S ITEM IS DESIGNED

[Captioner] 19:33:55
 TO
ACCOMPLISH TWO THINGS THAT WERE


[Captioner] 19:33:57
REQUIRED TO DO UNDER THE
CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT CODE.


[Captioner] 19:34:00
FIRST EACH

[Captioner] 19:34:03
 YEAR I AS THE
TREASURER AM REQUIRED TO PRESENT

[Captioner] 19:34:05

TO YOU AN INVESTMENT POLICY FOR


[Captioner] 19:34:09
THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR FOR YOUR
APPROVAL.


[Captioner] 19:34:12
SO THAT'S THE FIRST ITEM.
THE SECOND

[Captioner] 19:34:15
 ITEM IS THAT THE CITY
COUNCIL HAS

[Captioner] 19:34:19
 THE ABILITY UNDER
THE CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT CODE

[Captioner] 19:34:22

TO DELEGATE AUTHORITY FOR


[Captioner] 19:34:25
INVESTMENT -- DIRECTING
INVESTMENTS TO THE CITY


[Captioner] 19:34:29
TREASURER.
SO THAT'S THE SECOND ITEM

[Captioner] 19:34:31
.
AS PART OF THE APPROVAL OF THE


[Captioner] 19:34:34
INVESTMENT POLICY, WE HAVE OUR

[Captioner] 19:34:37

INVESTMENT MANAGER, PFM, DO

[Captioner] 19:34:40
 A
REVIEW OF THE INVESTMENT POLICY


[Captioner] 19:34:43
EACH YEAR TO MAKE SURE IT'S
STILL IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE


[Captioner] 19:34:45
CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT CODE.
FOR NEXT YEAR THEY'VE IDENTIFIED


[Captioner] 19:34:48
THAT THERE ARE A COUPLE OF
RELATIVELY MINOR CHANGES TO

[Captioner] 19:34:52
 BE
MADE THAT RELATE TO

[Captioner] 19:34:56
 HOW THE
MATURITY OF AN INVESTMENT IS

[Captioner] 19:34:58

COUNTED.


[Captioner] 19:35:01
THEY'RE CLARIFYING THAT THE
COUNTING OF THE

[Captioner] 19:35:04
 MATURITY BEGINS
ON THE

[Captioner] 19:35:06
 SETTLEMENT DATE RATHER
THAN THE TRADE DATE.


[Captioner] 19:35:09
SO THE TRADE DATE IS WHEN THE
INVESTMENT IS

[Captioner] 19:35:12
 INITIATED, THE
SETTLEMENT DATE IS ACTUALLY WHEN


[Captioner] 19:35:14
THE MONEY AND THE SECURITY
CHANGES HANDS.


[Captioner] 19:35:18
AND THEN THE SECOND PIECE OF
THAT

[Captioner] 19:35:22
 IS THAT

[Captioner] 19:35:25
 THEY MAKE A MAXIMUM
SETTLEMENT

[Captioner] 19:35:28
 PERIOD OF 45 DAYS.
SO THE MAXIMUM PERIOD

[Captioner] 19:35:31
 BETWEEN
THAT TRADE DATE AND THE

[Captioner] 19:35:33

SETTLEMENT IS 45 DAYS, SO WE'VE


[Captioner] 19:35:36
ADDED THAT LANGUAGE TO THE
CITY'S INVESTMENT POLICY

[Captioner] 19:35:40
.
I KNOW THAT

[Captioner] 19:35:44
 THERE WAS A QUESTION
RELATED TO THE

[Captioner] 19:35:48
 DEFINITION OF AN
NSRSD OR

[Captioner] 19:35:51
 NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED
STATISTICAL RATING

[Captioner] 19:35:57
 ORGANIZATION,
AND WE CAN CERTAINLY ADD A

[Captioner] 19:36:00

DEFINITION TO THE GLOSSARY IF


[Captioner] 19:36:03
ONE OF THE COUNCILMEMBERS, IN
MAKING THE MOTION

[Captioner] 19:36:06
, ADDS THAT TO
THE MOTION THAT THEY MAKE.


[Captioner] 19:36:09
THE NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED

[Captioner] 19:36:12

STATISTICAL RATING ORGANIZATIONS

[Captioner] 19:36:16

ARE ESTABLISHED BY THE


[Captioner] 19:36:18
 SECURITIES AND
EXCHANGE COMMISSION, AND THESE


[Captioner] 19:36:22
ARE ORGANIZATIONS THAT THE SEC

[Captioner] 19:36:26

ALLOWS TO BE USED TO MAKE

[Captioner] 19:36:28

INVESTMENT DECISIONS ON THE PART


[Captioner] 19:36:31
OF FINANCIAL ORGANIZATIONS AND
OTHERS.


[Captioner] 19:36:35
SO FOR OUR PURPOSES FOR THE
TYPES OF INVESTMENTS

[Captioner] 19:36:38
 THAT THE
CITY MAKES, THE THREE LEADING

[Captioner] 19:36:44

NSRSOs ARE

[Captioner] 19:36:48
 STANDARD & POOR'S,
MOODY'S

[Captioner] 19:36:51
 AND FITCH.
THAT'S ALL I HAVE IN TERMS OF

[Captioner] 19:36:53
 AN
OVERVIEW BUT I'M HAPPY TO


[Captioner] 19:36:54
ADDRESS ANY CLARIFYING
QUESTIONS.


[Captioner] 19:36:59
>> Councilmember Campbell:
THANK YOU FOR THAT QUICK


[Captioner] 19:37:02
OVERVIEW.
IT WAS VERY HELPFUL.


[Captioner] 19:37:06
AND THANK YOU FOR ANSWERING THAT
QUESTION FOR ME WHEN I ASKED YOU

[Captioner] 19:37:08

EARLIER TODAY, AND I THINK I


[Captioner] 19:37:12
WILL ADD THE MOTION TO ADD THAT
DEFINITION TO THE GLOSSARY.


[Captioner] 19:37:16
BUT I DIDN'T SEE

[Captioner] 19:37:20
 THE PFM, THEIR

[Captioner] 19:37:21

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE CHANGES


[Captioner] 19:37:24
IN THE POLICY.
WHERE IN THE POLICY IS IT GOING


[Captioner] 19:37:27
TO GO?
BECAUSE I DIDN'T SEE ANY

[Captioner] 19:37:30

REDNESS -- DOES IT HAVE TO BE IN


[Captioner] 19:37:33
THE POLICY ITSELF, OR IS IT JUST
A RECOMMENDATION?


[Captioner] 19:37:39
>> Mr. Persselin: THEY MADE
THE

[Captioner] 19:37:42
 RECOMMENDATION, AND I CAN
TELL YOU

[Captioner] 19:37:45
 THAT IF YOU -- IN THE
RESOLUTION ITSELF THAT'S

[Captioner] 19:37:48

ATTACHED TO THE STAFF REPORT,

[Captioner] 19:37:52

THE RECOMMENDATION CAN BE SEEN

[Captioner] 19:37:56

ON -- I'M FINDING THE PAGE


[Captioner] 19:38:06
HERE.
HERE WE GO.


[Captioner] 19:38:09
IT'S ON PAGE

[Captioner] 19:38:13
 6 6 OF THE

[Captioner] 19:38:16
 POLICY.
AND IF

[Captioner] 19:38:19
 YOU GO ABOUT TWO THIRDS
OF THE WAY DOWN THE

[Captioner] 19:38:23
 PAGE, AFTER
THE SERIES OF BULLETS, YOU'LL

[Captioner] 19:38:25

SEE


[Captioner] 19:38:26
>> Councilmember Campbell:
OKAY, I SEE IT NOW.


[Captioner] 19:38:29
I THINK I HAD EXPECTED TO BE IN
LIKE

[Captioner] 19:38:32
 AN UPDATE TO SOMETHING THAT

[Captioner] 19:38:35

WAS NON-EXISTENT.


[Captioner] 19:38:38
INSTEAD OF ADDING THIS INTO IT.
SO I DO SEE THAT RECOMMENDATION


[Captioner] 19:38:42
THERE NOW.
AND I THINK I HAD ONE OTHER

[Captioner] 19:38:43

QUESTION.


[Captioner] 19:38:47
 AS I WAS READING THROUGH THIS.


[Captioner] 19:38:54
HOLD ON ONE QUICK SECOND.
OH, I KNOW --

[Captioner] 19:38:56
 I DIDN'T WRITE IT
DOWN BECAUSE IT WAS IN MY HEAD.


[Captioner] 19:38:59
WHAT KINDS

[Captioner] 19:39:00
 OF INVESTMENTS DO WE
MAKE?


[Captioner] 19:39:04
DO WE, LIKE -- DOES THE POLICY
HAVE TO SAY

[Captioner] 19:39:07
 THAT THE CITY
DOESN'T INVEST IN, SAY,


[Captioner] 19:39:11
MARIJUANA OR ALCOHOL

[Captioner] 19:39:14
 OR
ORGANIZATIONS THAT DO HARM TO


[Captioner] 19:39:17
ANIMALS?
DO WE SAY THAT, OR DO WE LOOK

[Captioner] 19:39:18
 AT
THAT AS A STIPULATION?


[Captioner] 19:39:23
>> Mr. Persselin: SO OUR
INVESTMENT POLICY, THE PERMITTED

[Captioner] 19:39:27

INVESTMENTS, THERE'S A LISTING

[Captioner] 19:39:30

THAT STARTS ON PAGE

[Captioner] 19:39:34
 4, AND OUR
AUTHORIZED AND

[Captioner] 19:39:36
 SUITABLE
INVESTMENTS LIST IS BASICALLY


[Captioner] 19:39:37
WHAT'S INCLUDED IN THE
CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT CODE.


[Captioner] 19:39:42
NOW THE CITY COUNCIL CAN

[Captioner] 19:39:45
 MAKE
MORE RESTRICTIVE SPECIFICATIONS,


[Captioner] 19:39:48
AND THE COUNCIL HAS DONE THAT IN
THE PAST.


[Captioner] 19:39:52
I WOULD POINT YOU TO THE

[Captioner] 19:39:55
 BOTTOM
OF PAGE 6, WHERE IT SAYS


[Captioner] 19:39:58
PROHIBITED INVESTMENTS.
SO THERE'S PROHIBITED


[Captioner] 19:40:01
INVESTMENTS UNDER THE CALIFORNIA
GOVERNMENT

[Captioner] 19:40:05
 CODE, BUT THEN IF YOU
KEEP

[Captioner] 19:40:09
 GOING, YOU'LL FIND THAT
THERE'S

[Captioner] 19:40:13
 LANGUAGE IN THE SECOND
FULL PARAGRAPH

[Captioner] 19:40:16
 ON PAGE 7 WHERE
IT SAYS ADDITIONALLY PURSUANT

[Captioner] 19:40:19
 TO
CITY COUNCIL POLICY ADOPTED

[Captioner] 19:40:20

OCTOBER 9TH, 2018, THE CITY


[Captioner] 19:40:24
SHALL NOT INVEST IN ANY

[Captioner] 19:40:26
 FUNDS IN
SECURITIES ISSUED BY FIRMS WHOSE


[Captioner] 19:40:29
GENERAL BUSINESS ACTIVITIES ARE
CLASSIFIED AS ENERGY, OIL, GAS


[Captioner] 19:40:31
AND COAL, ACCORDING TO THE
BLOOMBERG INDUSTRY


[Captioner] 19:40:34
CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM.
SO THE CITY COUNCIL CAN CHOOSE


[Captioner] 19:40:38
TO TAKE ACTION TO MAKE -- YOU

[Captioner] 19:40:39

KNOW, PUT ADDITIONAL


[Captioner] 19:40:43
RESTRICTIONS ON INVESTMENTS.


[Captioner] 19:40:43
>> Councilmember Campbell:
OKAY.


[Captioner] 19:40:47
DOES THAT HAVE TO BE A PART OF
THE POLICY, OR HOW DO YOU

[Captioner] 19:40:49
 MAKE
THAT HAPPEN?


[Captioner] 19:40:51
>> Mr. Persselin: SO THAT
WOULD NEED TO BE PART OF THE


[Captioner] 19:40:55
INVESTMENT POLICY, AND IT WOULD
NEED TO BE ACTIONABLE IN THE

[Captioner] 19:40:58

SENSE THAT, YOU KNOW, AS I JUST


[Captioner] 19:41:01
READ OUT, WE'VE DEFINED OIL AND
GAS

[Captioner] 19:41:04
 INVESTMENTS IN A WAY THAT

[Captioner] 19:41:07

OUR INVESTMENT MANAGER CAN PUT


[Captioner] 19:41:10
INTO THEIR TRADING SYSTEM SO
THAT IT CAN FLAG THE

[Captioner] 19:41:13
 TYPE OF
INVESTMENTS THAT THE COUNCIL HAS

[Captioner] 19:41:15

PROHIBITED SO THAT ESSENTIALLY


[Captioner] 19:41:17
WHEN THEY'RE LOOKING FOR
INVESTMENTS FOR OUR CITY, THEY


[Captioner] 19:41:20
WON'T MAKE THOSE.
SO WE WOULD NEED TO BE

[Captioner] 19:41:23
 ABLE TO
DEFINE WHATEVER IT IS THAT WE DO


[Captioner] 19:41:26
OR DON'T WANT TO DO IN SUCH A
WAY THAT THE

[Captioner] 19:41:30
 FOLKS ON THE
TRADING DESK CAN TURN THAT INTO

[Captioner] 19:41:31

AN INVESTMENT DECISION.


[Captioner] 19:41:35
>> Councilmember Campbell: SO
DO YOU KNOW WHETHER OR

[Captioner] 19:41:37
 NOT WE'RE
INVESTING IN THOSE KINDS OF


[Captioner] 19:41:40
THINGS RIGHT NOW, LIKE
MARIJUANA, DRUGS, ALCOHOL?


[Captioner] 19:41:43
BECAUSE I KNOW, YOU KNOW,
MARIJUANA IS A HOT

[Captioner] 19:41:45
 COMMODITY
NOWADAYS IN TERMS OF AN


[Captioner] 19:41:48
INVESTMENT, BUT DO WE INVEST IN
THOSE KINDS OF COMPANIES?


[Captioner] 19:41:52
>> Mr. Persselin: SO THE --
AGAIN,

[Captioner] 19:41:55
 THE LISTING OF 
INVESTMENTS THAT

[Captioner] 19:41:58
 ARE PERMITTED
BY THE CITY IS WHAT'S DEFINED IN


[Captioner] 19:42:00
THE CALIFORNIA GOVERNMENT CODE.
SO FIRST OF ALL THESE ARE ALL


[Captioner] 19:42:03
WHAT ARE CALLED FIXED INCOME
INVESTMENTS, SO WE DO

[Captioner] 19:42:06
 NOT BUY
STOCK IN COMPANIES, FOR EXAMPLE

[Captioner] 19:42:10
.
AND WE ALSO DO NOT

[Captioner] 19:42:13
 INVEST IN
COMMODITIES, SO WE CAN'T BUY


[Captioner] 19:42:16
STUFF, YOU KNOW, ON SPEC THAT

[Captioner] 19:42:18

THE PRICE IS GOING TO GO UP AND


[Captioner] 19:42:20
THEN RESELL IT.
THE TYPES OF FIXED INCOME


[Captioner] 19:42:23
INVESTMENTS THAT WE'RE ALLOWED
TO PURCHASE ARE FAIRLY NARROWLY

[Captioner] 19:42:24

CONSTRAINED.


[Captioner] 19:42:27
SO THESE ARE TYPICALLY VERY
HIGHLY

[Captioner] 19:42:31
 RATED SECURITIES THAT ARE
EITHER ISSUED BY THE

[Captioner] 19:42:34
 FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT, STATE GOVERNMENTS,


[Captioner] 19:42:38
OTHER MUNICIPALITIES OR SIMILAR
ORGANIZATIONS

[Captioner] 19:42:41
, OR HIGHLY RATED
FIXED

[Captioner] 19:42:44
 INCOME SECURITIES ISSUED
BY

[Captioner] 19:42:47
 COMPANIES.
SO

[Captioner] 19:42:51
 THERE ARE COMPANIES WHOSE
BONDS, FOR EXAMPLE, WE

[Captioner] 19:42:53
 MAY
PURCHASE.


[Captioner] 19:42:56
I'M NOT AWARE OF

[Captioner] 19:42:59
 ANY COMPANIES
THAT THE CITY

[Captioner] 19:43:03
 HAS PURCHASED
FIXED

[Captioner] 19:43:05
 INCOME INVESTMENTS IN THAT
ARE IN THE BUSINESS, FOR


[Captioner] 19:43:09
EXAMPLE, OF MARIJUANA OR OTHER
THINGS

[Captioner] 19:43:12
 LIKE THAT.
I'M GUESSING THAT THOSE ARE


[Captioner] 19:43:16
PROBABLY NOT HIGHLY RATED BY THE

[Captioner] 19:43:16

NSRSOs.


[Captioner] 19:43:21
BUT AGAIN, TO THE EXTENT THAT
THE CITY COUNCIL

[Captioner] 19:43:25
 WANTED TO, YOU
KNOW, IDENTIFY A

[Captioner] 19:43:28
 CLASS OF
ACTIVITIES

[Captioner] 19:43:32
 THAT COULD BE
ASSOCIATED, YOU KNOW, IN

[Captioner] 19:43:34
 A --
LIKE I SAID, YOU KNOW, IN A WAY


[Captioner] 19:43:38
THAT THE TRADERS ON THE DESK
COULD EASILY

[Captioner] 19:43:40
 IDENTIFY, YOU KNOW,
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THE CITY


[Captioner] 19:43:42
COUNCIL COULD CHOOSE TO DO.
>> Councilmember Campbell: I


[Captioner] 19:43:42
SEE.
OKAY.


[Captioner] 19:43:46
OKAY.
AND OUR

[Captioner] 19:43:48
 INVESTMENT ADVISOR IS
THE ONE THAT YOU WORK CLOSELY


[Captioner] 19:43:52
WITH?
IS THAT

[Captioner] 19:43:55
 THE PFM?
>> Mr. Persselin: PFM, THAT'S


[Captioner] 19:43:56
CORRECT.
>> Councilmember Campbell: AND


[Captioner] 19:43:58
WHEN DOES THE ANNUAL FINANCIAL
STATEMENT COME OUT?


[Captioner] 19:44:01
>> Mr. Persselin: SO OUR
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS COME OUT

[Captioner] 19:44:04

EACH YEAR TYPICALLY IN THE MONTH


[Captioner] 19:44:07
OF DECEMBER.
THOSE ARE THE AUDITED FINANCIAL


[Captioner] 19:44:13
STATEMENTS.
WE DO HAVE A MONTHLY INVESTMENT

[Captioner] 19:44:15

REPORT THAT LISTS OUT EVERY


[Captioner] 19:44:19
SINGLE INVESTMENT HELD BY THE

[Captioner] 19:44:21

CITY AS OF THE END OF THAT


[Captioner] 19:44:24
MONTH.
SO TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU'RE


[Captioner] 19:44:28
CURIOUS ABOUT WHAT WE'RE HOLDING
IN OUR PORTFOLIO,

[Captioner] 19:44:29
 YOU CAN SEE
THAT.


[Captioner] 19:44:32
AND THE INVESTMENTMENT REPORT
ALSO

[Captioner] 19:44:36
 SUMMARIZES WHAT WE'RE
INVESTING IN, IT SUMMARIZES OUR


[Captioner] 19:44:40
INVESTMENT ACTIVITY FOR THAT
MONTH, AND IT ALSO PROVIDE

[Captioner] 19:44:41
S
GENERAL BACKGROUND INFORMATION


[Captioner] 19:44:45
ABOUT HOW THE CITY'S

[Captioner] 19:44:46
 PORTFOLIOS
ARE MANAGED.


[Captioner] 19:44:46
>> Councilmember Campbell:
OKAY.


[Captioner] 19:44:50
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THIS.


[Captioner] 19:44:54
I'M WILLING TO MAKE A MOTION --
>> Mayor Mei: THERE'S ACTUALLY


[Captioner] 19:44:56
TWO OTHER SPEAKERS.
>> Councilmember Campbell:


[Captioner] 19:44:57
SORRY.
>> Mayor Mei: NEXT IS


[Captioner] 19:45:00
COUNCILMEMBER SHAO.
>> Councilmember Shao: THANK


[Captioner] 19:45:01
YOU, MADAME MAYOR.
I HAVE A QUICK QUESTION.


[Captioner] 19:45:05
SO IF WE HAVE MONEY SITTING IN A
BANK

[Captioner] 19:45:08
 COLLECTING INTEREST, WOULD
THAT BE CONSIDERED AN


[Captioner] 19:45:11
INVESTMENT?
>> Mr. Persselin: NO.


[Captioner] 19:45:16
SO YOU'RE ASKING A SOMEWHAT
TECHNICAL QUESTION, BUT FOR

[Captioner] 19:45:19

PURPOSES OF FINANCIAL REPORTING,


[Captioner] 19:45:23
FUNDS THAT ARE HELD IN A BANK
WITH A MATURITY OF

[Captioner] 19:45:26
 LESS THAN A
YEAR ARE NOT CONSIDERED AN

[Captioner] 19:45:29

INVESTMENT.


[Captioner] 19:45:32
WE REFER TO THAT AS CASH.
SO FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOU LOOK INTO

[Captioner] 19:45:34

THE -- AS I REFERRED TO, THE


[Captioner] 19:45:36
MONTHLY CASH INVESTMENT REPORT,
YOU'LL SEE A LISTING OF


[Captioner] 19:45:40
INVESTMENTS, AND THESE ARE ALL
THINGS THAT ARE CONSIDERED

[Captioner] 19:45:42

INVESTMENTS, AND THEN WE LOW


[Captioner] 19:45:45
 BELOW THAT, YOU WILL
SEE CASH

[Captioner] 19:45:47
 HOLDINGS.
SO FOR EXAMPLE, THE CITY'S


[Captioner] 19:45:51
CHECKING ACCOUNT HELD AT ITS
BANK, BANK OF AMERICA, IS LISTED

[Captioner] 19:45:53

AS CASH RATHER THAN AS AN


[Captioner] 19:45:55
INVESTMENT.
>> Councilmember Shao: MY


[Captioner] 19:45:58
FOLLOW-UP QUESTION, ACTUALLY
COMMENT, IS THAT TO THE BEST OF


[Captioner] 19:46:02
MY KNOWLEDGE, SINCE I SIT ON

[Captioner] 19:46:05

HACA, HOUSING AUTHORITY OF


[Captioner] 19:46:08
COUNTY OF ALAMEDA, WE HAVE A LOT
OF SURPLUS

[Captioner] 19:46:12
 SITTING IN THE BANK
AND DUE TO

[Captioner] 19:46:15
 THE RAISE OF INTEREST
RATE BY THE FEDERAL

[Captioner] 19:46:18
 RESERVE OVER
THE YEARS, WE IN

[Captioner] 19:46:22
 HACA HAVE
SUCCESSFULLY PUT THOSE

[Captioner] 19:46:25
 SURPLUS
FUNDS IN A BANK

[Captioner] 19:46:28
 ACCOUNT THAT
WILL COLLECT AT

[Captioner] 19:46:31
 LEAST 2% ANNUAL
INTEREST RATE.


[Captioner] 19:46:35
COMPARING WITH ALMOST ZERO,

[Captioner] 19:46:36
 LIKE
FIVE YEARS AGO.


[Captioner] 19:46:42
SO I DON'T KNOW WHETHER SUCH A
MANEUVER FROM

[Captioner] 19:46:45
 A LOW INTEREST
RATE BANK ACCOUNT TO

[Captioner] 19:46:48
 A MEDIOCRE
INTEREST RATE BANK ACCOUNT WOULD

[Captioner] 19:46:50

BE CONSIDERED INVESTMENT.


[Captioner] 19:46:57
>> Mr. Persselin: SO AGAIN,
YOU KNOW, TECHNICALLY IF THE

[Captioner] 19:47:00

TERM OF THE INVESTMENT OR THE --


[Captioner] 19:47:03
YOU KNOW, WHATEVER IT IS IS LESS
THAN A YEAR, THEN

[Captioner] 19:47:05
 IT'S NOT
TYPICALLY CONSIDERED AN


[Captioner] 19:47:11
INVESTMENT.
JUST SO YOU'RE AWARE, FOR THE


[Captioner] 19:47:14
CITY OF FREMONT, WE CAREFULLY
MONITOR OUR

[Captioner] 19:47:17
 LIQUIDITY NEEDS, SO
THE AMOUNT THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY


[Captioner] 19:47:20
HOLDING AT THE BANK IN OUR
CHECKING ACCOUNT IS REALLY

[Captioner] 19:47:23
 ONLY
THE AMOUNT THAT WE THINK IS


[Captioner] 19:47:26
NECESSARY TO GET US THROUGH THE

[Captioner] 19:47:29

NEXT, YOU KNOW, TYPICALLY COUPLE


[Captioner] 19:47:32
WEEKS, THE NEXT PAYROLL OR OTHER
THINGS THAT WE'RE

[Captioner] 19:47:35
 AWARE.
MOST OF OUR

[Captioner] 19:47:38
 LIQUIDITY POOL, THE
AMOUNTS THAT WE'LL NEED IN THE


[Captioner] 19:47:41
NEXT WEEKS OR MONTHS, IS
ACTUALLY

[Captioner] 19:47:45
 HELD IN ONE OF OUR TWO
POOLS,

[Captioner] 19:47:48
 EITHER THE LOCAL AGENCY
INVESTMENT FUND MANAGED BY

[Captioner] 19:47:51
 THE
STATE OF CALIFORNIA, OR THE

[Captioner] 19:47:53

CALIFORNIA ASSET MANAGEMENT


[Captioner] 19:47:56
TRUST POOL CAMP.
SO CAMP, FOR EXAMPLE,

[Captioner] 19:48:00
 WAS
CURRENT EARNING ABOUT

[Captioner] 19:48:03
 5.2%.
SO WE'RE DEFINITELY

[Captioner] 19:48:06
 TRYING TO
MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT LEAVING

[Captioner] 19:48:09

OUR MONEY IN A PLACE WHERE IT'S


[Captioner] 19:48:10
NOT EARNING A MARKET RATE.
>> Councilmember Shao: THANK


[Captioner] 19:48:13
YOU VERY MUCH.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:48:16
NEXT IS COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN.
>> Councilmember Kassan: THANK


[Captioner] 19:48:18
YOU.
I REALLY WANT TO THANK


[Captioner] 19:48:20
COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL FOR
BRINGING THIS UP.


[Captioner] 19:48:24
THIS GIVES ME AN OPPORTUNITY TO
MENTION THAT A FEW YEARS AGO,

[Captioner] 19:48:26
 I
ASKED THAT WE DO SCREENING OF


[Captioner] 19:48:30
OUR INVESTMENTS USING ESG

[Captioner] 19:48:32

CRITERIA, AND THAT WAS NOT


[Captioner] 19:48:36
SUPPORTED BY THE COUNCIL.
I HAVEN'T BROUGHT IT UP

[Captioner] 19:48:37
 AGAIN IN
THE BELIEF THAT THAT PROBABLY


[Captioner] 19:48:40
WOULDN'T BE SUPPORTED, BUT YOU
KNOW, WE DO HAVE

[Captioner] 19:48:43
 INVESTMENTS --
THE LAST I CHECKED, WE DO HAVE


[Captioner] 19:48:45
INVESTMENTS IN COMPANIES THAT
INVEST IN THINGS THAT WE


[Captioner] 19:48:49
PROBABLY WOULDN'T SUPPORT VERY
MUCH, LIKE PRIVATE PRISONS, FOR

[Captioner] 19:48:53

EXAMPLE, SO GIVEN THAT

[Captioner] 19:48:54

COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL BROUGHT


[Captioner] 19:48:56
IT UP, I JUST THOUGHT IT WOULD
BE A GOOD THING TO SHARE THAT


[Captioner] 19:49:00
THERE IS THAT HISTORY, AND IF
THERE IS A DESIRE

[Captioner] 19:49:03
 TO MAKE A
CHANGE IN THAT.


[Captioner] 19:49:06
SOMEONE FROM PFM, I BELIEVE,
CAME IN AND SPOKE TO US ABOUT

[Captioner] 19:49:08

WHETHER IT WAS ADVISABLE TO MAKE


[Captioner] 19:49:11
THAT CHANGE AND WE WERE TOLD
THAT IT WOULDN'T MAKE A RADICAL

[Captioner] 19:49:13

CHANGE BECAUSE ALREADY THE BEST


[Captioner] 19:49:16
PERFORMING COMPANIES TEND TO
ALSO BE THE ONES THAT ARE, YOU

[Captioner] 19:49:19

KNOW, WELL RATED UNDER ESG


[Captioner] 19:49:22
CRITERIA, WHICH IS
ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND


[Captioner] 19:49:25
GOVERNANCE SCREENING CRITERIA.
BUT THERE ARE SOME THAT I


[Captioner] 19:49:27
BELIEVE, YOU KNOW, WOULD
PROBABLY BE SCREENED OUT BECAUSE


[Captioner] 19:49:31
OF THE PRIVATE PRISON ISSUE, FOR
EXAMPLE,

[Captioner] 19:49:35
 SO I'D LOVE TO MAYBE
REVISIT THAT IF THERE IS AN

[Captioner] 19:49:38

INTEREST, AND I GUESS WE


[Captioner] 19:49:41
PROBABLY HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL NEXT

[Captioner] 19:49:44

YEAR, BUT THAT WOULD BE -- I


[Captioner] 19:49:48
WOULD VERY MUCH APPRECIATE US
REALLY PUTTING OUR VALUES INTO


[Captioner] 19:49:50
ACTION WHEN IT COMES TO OUR
INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO.


[Captioner] 19:49:53
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:49:59
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
DO WE HAVE A MOTION?


[Captioner] 19:50:02
COUNCILMEMBER SHAO?
>> Councilmember Shao: I'D


[Captioner] 19:50:05
LIKE TO SECOND.
>> Mayor Mei: WHO MADE THE


[Captioner] 19:50:05
MOTION?
>> Councilmember Campbell: I


[Captioner] 19:50:07
WAS GOING TO.
I WAS GOING TO.


[Captioner] 19:50:10
>> Mayor Mei: COUNCILMEMBER
CAMPBELL?


[Captioner] 19:50:13
>> Councilmember Campbell: I'D
LIKE TO ACCEPT

[Captioner] 19:50:16
 STAFF'S
RECOMMENDATION WITH

[Captioner] 19:50:19
 ADDING IN
THE GLOSSARY

[Captioner] 19:50:23
 THE N

[Captioner] 19:50:24
 --
>> Mr. Persselin: THE


[Captioner] 19:50:27
DEFINITION OF THE NATIONALLY
RECOGNIZED STATISTICAL

[Captioner] 19:50:28
 RATING
ORGANIZATIONS.


[Captioner] 19:50:29
>> Councilmember Campbell:
YES, PLEASE.


[Captioner] 19:50:30
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:50:33
I KNOW THAT YOU MADE THOSE
CHANGES.


[Captioner] 19:50:33
>> Councilmember Shao: I
SECOND.


[Captioner] 19:50:36
>> Mayor Mei: COUNCILMEMBER
SHAO, OKAY.


[Captioner] 19:50:39
THANK YOU.
>> Vice Mayor Cox: CAN

[Captioner] 19:50:41
 I MAKE
A FRIENDLY AMENDMENT THAT WE


[Captioner] 19:50:44
COULD REFERENCE THE LINK TO
THOSE ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE

[Captioner] 19:50:46

THE DEFINITION OF THE


[Captioner] 19:50:48
INVESTMENT?
BECAUSE IT DOES CHANGE, AND IT


[Captioner] 19:50:51
CAN BE UPDATED, AND JUST
REFERENCE THAT AND BE

[Captioner] 19:50:55
 USED AS A
LINK INSTEAD OF USING THE ACTUAL


[Captioner] 19:51:03
DOCUMENT.
I WOULD BE ABLE TO MOVE WITH THE


[Captioner] 19:51:05
MOTION MOATION BUT WITH THE
EXCEPTION THAT THOSE DEFINITIONS


[Captioner] 19:51:07
COULD COME FROM THE LINK.
>> Mayor Mei: I'D HAVE TO


[Captioner] 19:51:10
CHECK WITH OUR CITY ATTORNEY,
OUR COUNSEL, BECAUSE I THINK


[Captioner] 19:51:13
THAT WE'D WANT IT TO BE DEFINED
AND IF WE'RE GOING TO REFERENCE


[Captioner] 19:51:16
A LINK, THAT IT WOULD BE STATIC,
AND SO IF

[Captioner] 19:51:20
 OUR CITY ATTORNEY
COULD

[Captioner] 19:51:23
 REPLY TO THIS FEEDBACK

[Captioner] 19:51:25

BEING INCLUDED.


[Captioner] 19:51:28
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado:
MAYOR, TO BE FRANK, I'M NOT SURE

[Captioner] 19:51:30

I UNDERSTAND WHAT THE FRIENDLY


[Captioner] 19:51:32
AMENDMENT TO THE MOTION IS
INTENDED TO DO.


[Captioner] 19:51:35
>> Vice Mayor Cox: INSTEAD OF
ATTACHING A HARD COPY OF

[Captioner] 19:51:39
 A LIST
OF DEFINITIONS, SOME THINGS CAN

[Captioner] 19:51:42

CHANGE FROM YEAR TO YEAR, AND IF


[Captioner] 19:51:45
WE ATTACH THAT DEFINITION, IT
COULD BE OUTDATED NEXT YEAR

[Captioner] 19:51:47
 IF
THERE'S SOME UPDATES AND CHANGES


[Captioner] 19:51:51
TO THE GOVERNMENT CODE.
AND SO THAT'S WHERE I WAS


[Captioner] 19:51:55
REFERENCING BACK THAT IT MAY BE
IN THE BEST

[Captioner] 19:51:58
 INTEREST OF INSTEAD

[Captioner] 19:52:01

OF ATTACHING AND ADDING IN THE


[Captioner] 19:52:04
ACTUAL DEFINITIONS, WE JUST
REFERENCE A LINK THAT WOULD HAVE


[Captioner] 19:52:07
THOSE DEFINITIONS.
SO IF ANYTHING IS UPDATED, WE


[Captioner] 19:52:10
ALREADY HAVE IT.
>> Mayor Mei: THE ONLY CAVEAT


[Captioner] 19:52:13
THAT I WOULD ADD THERE, THOUGH,
IS THAT SINCE WE DON'T CONTROL


[Captioner] 19:52:16
THE WEBSITE, WHEREAS WE CONTROL
THE LIST THAT'S ATTACHED, THAT


[Captioner] 19:52:19
IF SOMEBODY WERE TO MAKE SOME
RADICAL CHANGE, WE

[Captioner] 19:52:21
 WOULDN'T HAVE
ANY INSIGHT, AND I THINK THE


[Captioner] 19:52:24
DEFINITIONS THAT COUNCILMEMBER
CAMPBELL IS ASKING FOR IS THE


[Captioner] 19:52:27
ONE SPECIFICALLY TO DEFINE THOSE
THAT ARE INCLUDED IN

[Captioner] 19:52:30
 THIS
ATTACHMENT ITSELF IN THE POLICY,


[Captioner] 19:52:33
SO THOSE WOULD BE THE
DEFINITIONS OF THOSE AGENCIES


[Captioner] 19:52:34
AND JUST THE SPELLING OUT OF THE
ACRONYMS.


[Captioner] 19:52:38
SO AS LONG AS IT'S CONSISTENT
AND WE COULD REVISIT IT AS

[Captioner] 19:52:41
 IT AN
ANNUAL POLICY

[Captioner] 19:52:43
 AT SET TIME,
RATHER THAN HAVING A STATIC


[Captioner] 19:52:45
LINK.
THE ONLY REASON I'M CAUTIONARY


[Captioner] 19:52:48
ABOUT THIS IS THE FACT THAT WE
DON'T CONTROL THAT WEBSITE SO I


[Captioner] 19:52:51
DON'T KNOW WHAT'S BEING SAID ON
THAT WEBSITE, WHEREAS

[Captioner] 19:52:53
 THE
ATTACHMENT IS A CLEAR DEFINITION


[Captioner] 19:52:55
AND DEFINED.
>> Vice Mayor Cox: I KNOW JUST


[Captioner] 19:52:58
BASED ON MY OWN EXPERIENCES, WE
HAVE REFERENCED OTHER EXTERNAL

[Captioner] 19:52:59

WEBSITES AND THOSE ARE THINGS


[Captioner] 19:53:03
THAT HAVE ALWAYS BEEN DOCUMENTED
IN CONTRACTS AND OTHER

[Captioner] 19:53:05
 LEGAL
DOCUMENTS.


[Captioner] 19:53:08
SO YOU KNOW, I'M HAPPY TO
WITHDRAW THE

[Captioner] 19:53:12
 FRIENDLY AMENDMENT,
BUT JUST

[Captioner] 19:53:15
 REALIZE IN CASE IT
CHANGES, WE WOULD JUST HAVE TO


[Captioner] 19:53:17
UPDATE IT ON A REGULAR BASIS.
>> Mayor Mei: SURE.


[Captioner] 19:53:20
OUR CITY ATTORNEY, DOES THAT
CLARIFY A LITTLE BIT OF WHAT THE


[Captioner] 19:53:22
QUESTION WAS FOR THE FRIENDLY
AMENDMENT?


[Captioner] 19:53:25
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: YES,
AND RESPECTFULLY I WOULD SAY IT

[Captioner] 19:53:29

IS UNNECESSARY, THAT WE

[Captioner] 19:53:31

ESSENTIALLY EXPAND ON AN ACRONYM


[Captioner] 19:53:34
THAT ALREADY EXISTS WITHIN THE
POLICY, SO I THINK WE CAN

[Captioner] 19:53:37
 MOVE
THIS FORWARD AS THE ORIGINAL


[Captioner] 19:53:40
MOTION PUT FORTH BY
COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL, NOW

[Captioner] 19:53:42
 THAT
VICE MAYOR COX HAS REMOVED HER


[Captioner] 19:53:45
REQUEST.
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY.


[Captioner] 19:53:47
SO WE HAVE A MOTION AND A
SECOND.


[Captioner] 19:53:51
PLEASE VOTE.


[Captioner] 19:53:59
THANK YOU.
THE MOTION

[Captioner] 19:54:02
 PASSES WITH
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN VOTING NAY


[Captioner] 19:54:03
AND COUNCILMEMBER KENG NOTED AS
ABSENT.


[Captioner] 19:54:07
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:54:10
NEXT ON OUR AGENDA THIS EVENING
IS

[Captioner] 19:54:13
 ITEM 5A, WHICH IS THE OLD

[Captioner] 19:54:14

SCHOOL MILLS ACT CONTRACT.


[Captioner] 19:54:17
AND AT THIS TIME, I'D LIKE TO
INVITE ASSOCIATE

[Captioner] 19:54:21
 PLANNER PATEL,
WHO WILL PROVIDE A


[Captioner] 19:54:27
PRESENTATION.
AS WELL AS WAYLAND LI AND

[Captioner] 19:54:31
 TERRY
WONG, WHO'S JOINING FROM ROBSON

[Captioner] 19:54:32

HOMES, I THINK.


[Captioner] 19:54:35
SO WELCOME.


[Captioner] 19:54:44
>> THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR AND
MEMBERS OF THE CITY COUNCIL.


[Captioner] 19:54:49
I'M THE PROJECT PLANNER FOR
THE SUBJECT ITEM.


[Captioner] 19:54:57
TONIGHT'S HEARING CONCERNS A
HISTORICAL PROPERTY

[Captioner] 19:54:59
 CONTRACT, OR
MORE COMMONLY KNOWN AS A MILLS


[Captioner] 19:55:03
ACT CONTRACT, FOR THE FORMER
MISSION ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

[Captioner] 19:55:06
 AND
CITY HALL,

[Captioner] 19:55:08
 REFERRED TO AS "THE
OLD SCHOOL.


[Captioner] 19:55:12
" GENERALLY THE MILLS ACT
CONTRACT SERVES AS A TOOL

[Captioner] 19:55:15
 TO
MOTIVATE A OWNER OF A HISTORIC


[Captioner] 19:55:18
PROPERTY TO RESTORE OR MAINTAIN
THEIR HISTORIC

[Captioner] 19:55:21
 BUILDING IN
EXCHANGE FOR TAX SAVINGS ON THAT


[Captioner] 19:55:29
PROPERTY.
THE PROPERTY IN QUESTION IS


[Captioner] 19:55:33
LOCATED AT 43551 MISSION
BOULEVARD IN

[Captioner] 19:55:34
 THE MISSION

[Captioner] 19:55:53
PEDESTRIAN.
THE OLD SCHOOL WAS LISTED ON THE

[Captioner] 19:55:55

PRIMARY HISTORIC RESOURCES


[Captioner] 19:55:57
INVENTORY FOR THE CITY OF
FREMONT IN 1991.


[Captioner] 19:56:02
IN 1998, A DEPARTMENT

[Captioner] 19:56:05
 OF PARKS
AND RECREATION FORM WAS


[Captioner] 19:56:08
COMPLETED TO GATHER DATA ON THE
OLD SCHOOL, AND

[Captioner] 19:56:11
 TO EVALUATITY
HISTORICAL AND

[Captioner] 19:56:13
 ARCHITECTURAL
MERIT, ACCORDING TO THE CRITERIA


[Captioner] 19:56:17
OF THE CALIFORNIA REGISTER OF
HISTORIC RESOURCES, AS WELL

[Captioner] 19:56:19
 AS
THE NATIONAL REGISTER OF


[Captioner] 19:56:22
HISTORIC PLACES.
THAT

[Captioner] 19:56:25
 EXERCISE CONCLUDED THAT THE
OLD SCHOOL RETAINS A HIGH DEGREE

[Captioner] 19:56:29

OF INTEGRITY AS A HISTORIC


[Captioner] 19:56:32
STRUCTURE, AND AS AN IMPORTANT
LANDMARK IN THE CITY OF

 FREMONT
DUE TOITY ASSOCIATION WITH


[Captioner] 19:56:39
SIGNIFICANT PERSONS AND EVENTS
AS WELL AS ITS

[Captioner] 19:56:41
 RELATIVELY RARE
ARCHITECTURAL STYLE.


[Captioner] 19:56:46
OVER THE YEARS, THE CITY HAS
ACTED ON

[Captioner] 19:56:49
 MULTIPLE APPLICATIONS
FILED

[Captioner] 19:56:51
 FOR THE PROPERTY,
INCLUDING A CONDITIONAL USE


[Captioner] 19:56:55
PERMIT AND TENTATIVE TRACT MAP.
TODAY,

[Captioner] 19:56:58
 THE PROPERTY IS HOME TO
11 CONDOMINIUMS THAT

[Captioner] 19:57:00
 SERVE AS
LIVE/WORK UNITS.


[Captioner] 19:57:09
SO STATE LAW REQUIRES THAT A
MILLS ACT

[Captioner] 19:57:12
 PROGRAM BE
ADMINISTERED AND IMPLEMENTED BY


[Captioner] 19:57:17
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS, AND FREMONT'S

MUNICIPAL CODE STATES THAT A

MILLS ACT CONTRACT MAY BE
APPROVED AT THE DISCRETION OF


[Captioner] 19:57:29
THE CITY COUNCIL.
THE OLD SCHOOL

[Captioner] 19:57:31
 CONVEYS
SIGNIFICANT INFORMATION


[Captioner] 19:57:34
REGARDING THE EARLY HISTORY OF
THE AREA, AND IS LISTED ON THE

[Captioner] 19:57:36

FREMONT REGISTER, AND,


[Captioner] 19:57:37
THEREFORE, QUALIFIES FOR A MILLS

[Captioner] 19:57:42
THE PRESERVATION OF THE OLD

[Captioner] 19:57:44

SCHOOL FACILITY THROUGH THE


[Captioner] 19:57:47
CONTRACT WOULD HELP ENSURE THAT
THE SUBJECT RESOURCE WILL REMAIN

[Captioner] 19:57:50

OPERABLE AS A LIVE/WORK USE AND


[Captioner] 19:57:51
MAINTAINED AS A HISTORIC

10-YEAR TERM, AND THE

IS BINDING TO ALL OWNERS DURING

[Captioner] 19:58:07

THE CONTRACT PERIOD.


[Captioner] 19:58:12
CONTRACTS ARE AUTOMATICALLY
RENEWED EACH YEAR, AND ARE

[Captioner] 19:58:13

TRANSFERRED TO NEW OWNERS WHEN


[Captioner] 19:58:17
THE PROPERTY IS SOLD.
UNDER THE

[Captioner] 19:58:21
 CONTRACT, THE PROPERTY
OWNER AGREES TO

[Captioner] 19:58:23

 PRESERVATION
STANDARDS AND CONDITIONS


[Captioner] 19:58:32
IDENTIFIED IN THE CONTRACT.


[Captioner] 19:58:35
PERIODIC INSPECTIONS BY THE CITY
WOULD ENSURE

[Captioner] 19:58:38
 PROPER MAINTENANCE
OF THE PROPERTY AND PENALTIES


[Captioner] 19:58:41
COULD BE IMPOSED FOR BREACH OF
CONTRACT

[Captioner] 19:58:44
 OR FAILURE TO PROTECT
THE HISTORIC PROPERTY.


[Captioner] 19:58:53
IN APRIL OF THIS YEAR, THE

THEREFORE, AUTHORIZE THE
EXECUTION OF THE FINAL


[Captioner] 19:59:53
CONTRACT.
THAT CONCLUDES STAFF'S


[Captioner] 19:59:56
PRESENTATION.
I'D LIKE TO NOTE THAT THE


[Captioner] 19:59:59
APPLICANT HAS ALSO PREPARED A
SHORT PRESENTATION FOR YOUR

[Captioner] 19:59:59

CONSIDERATION.


[Captioner] 20:00:02
MEANWHILE, I'M AVAILABLE TO HELP
ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT THE


[Captioner] 20:00:05
COUNCIL MIGHT HAVE.
>> Mayor Mei: SO AT THIS TIME


[Captioner] 20:00:07
FIRST FOR THIS PRESENTATION, I'D
LIKE TO CHECK WITH THE COUNCIL


[Captioner] 20:00:10
IF THERE'S ANY QUESTIONS FROM
THE COUNCILMEMBERS CONCERNING

[Captioner] 20:00:11

THE PRESENTATION GIVEN JUST


[Captioner] 20:00:16
NOW.
COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL.


[Captioner] 20:00:17
>> Councilmember Campbell:
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:00:23
I GUESS I HAVE A COUPLE
QUESTIONS BECAUSE I'M REALLY


[Captioner] 20:00:26
CONFUSED BY THIS.
I REALLY PROBABLY AM NOT


[Captioner] 20:00:29
FOLLOWING IT IN WHAT YOU'RE
SAYING TO ME.


[Captioner] 20:00:32
WHO CURRENTLY OWNS THE PROPERTY
RIGHT NOW?


[Captioner] 20:00:35
DOES THE CITY OWN IT OR DO

[Captioner] 20:00:36
 THE
CONDOMINIUM OWNERS OWN IT?


[Captioner] 20:00:40
>> THE PROPERTY OWNER IS

[Captioner] 20:00:43
 AN LLC
ENTITY, WHICH THE APPLICANT CAN

[Captioner] 20:00:45

NAME, BUT THE CITY DOES NOT OWN


[Captioner] 20:00:48
THE PROPERTY.
>> Councilmember

[Captioner] 20:00:50
 Campbell: SO
WHAT IS THE CONNECTION IF THE


[Captioner] 20:00:52
CITY DOESN'T OWN THE PROPERTY,
OTHER THAN THE GENERAL PLAN?


[Captioner] 20:00:57
>> WITH RESPECT TO A MILLS ACT

[Captioner] 20:00:59

CONTRACT, A MILLS ACT CONTRACT


[Captioner] 20:01:02
USUALLY INVOLVES THE CITY ON ONE
END AND A PRIVATE

[Captioner] 20:01:03
 PROPERTY OWNER
ON THE RECEIVING END.


[Captioner] 20:01:07
SO THE CITY MAY NOT BE A PARTY

[Captioner] 20:01:10

TOITY

[Captioner] 20:01:14
 -- NEED TO OWN THE LAND TO
EXECUTE A

[Captioner] 20:01:16
 MILLS ACT CONTRACT.
>> Councilmember Campbell:


[Captioner] 20:01:19
WHAT ABOUT THE CONDOMINIUM
PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THE

[Captioner] 20:01:21
 LIVE/WORK
SPACE, WHAT IS THE CONNECTION


[Captioner] 20:01:24
WITH THEM?
BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO PAY

[Captioner] 20:01:28
 A
MORTGAGOR

[Captioner] 20:01:30
 CONDOMINIUM FEES OR
SOMETHING, CORRECT?


[Captioner] 20:01:33
>> THAT IS CORRECT, AND THAT IS
A -- THAT PAYMENT STRUCTURE CAN


[Captioner] 20:01:37
PROBABLY BE ARTICULATED BY THE
APPLICANT WITH

[Captioner] 20:01:39
 RESPECT TO HOW
THE PAYMENT OPTION WORKS OR


[Captioner] 20:01:42
AFFECTS THE MILLS ACT CONTRACT.
>> Councilmember Campbell: I


[Captioner] 20:01:45
WOULD BE INTERESTED TO SEE HOW
THAT APPLIES AND

[Captioner] 20:01:48
 HOW THE PEOPLE
THAT ARE LIVING THERE MIGHT BE


[Captioner] 20:01:51
IMPACTED BY A SWITCH OR A CHANGE
IN OWNERSHIP.


[Captioner] 20:01:58
AND THEN

[Captioner] 20:02:03
 --
>> DID YOU WANT TO HAVE THAT


[Captioner] 20:02:06
QUESTION ADDRESSED AT THIS
MOMENT OR SHOULD WE WAIT FOR THE


[Captioner] 20:02:08
APPLICANT TO ADDRESS IT?
>> Mayor Mei: THE APPLICATION


[Captioner] 20:02:10
HAS A PRESENTATION TOO THIS
EVENING FOLLOWING YOUR


[Captioner] 20:02:11
QUESTIONS.
>> Councilmember Campbell:


[Captioner] 20:02:12
OKAY.
SO WE CAN HOLD IT UNTIL THEY


[Captioner] 20:02:16
HAVE PRESENTED BECAUSE I DO HAVE
ANOTHER QUESTION, AND

[Captioner] 20:02:20
 IT'S ABOUT
THIS PIECE -- WHAT

[Captioner] 20:02:22
 HAPPENS
AFTER -- YOU SAID A MINIMUM OF


[Captioner] 20:02:24
10 YEARS.
WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THE 10-YEAR


[Captioner] 20:02:26
PERIOD?
>> SO IT A ROLLING 10-YEAR


[Captioner] 20:02:31
CONTRACT.
MEANING BY THE TIME THE FIRST


[Captioner] 20:02:35
YEAR EXPIRES, IT WILL ALL
MATTICALLY ADD ANOTHER YEAR

[Captioner] 20:02:38
 TO
THAT CONTRACT, SO THERE WILL


[Captioner] 20:02:40
NEVER BE A PERIOD OF LESS THAN
NINE YEARS AND ONE DAY TO THAT


[Captioner] 20:02:41
CONTRACT.
>> Councilmember Campbell:


[Captioner] 20:02:44
OKAY.
SO THAT MEANS THAT ROBSON

[Captioner] 20:02:48
 WILL
CONTINUE TO OWN THIS PROPERTY,


[Captioner] 20:02:51
OR NOT ROBSON BUT THAT OTHER LLC
YOU

[Captioner] 20:02:54
 WERE TELLING ME ABOUT?
>> THE UNDERLYING PROPERTY

[Captioner] 20:02:56

OWNER, IRRESPECTIVE OF WHO OWNS


[Captioner] 20:03:00
IT, UNTIL THE CONTRACT COMES TO
A HALT,

[Captioner] 20:03:03
 AND THERE'S A PROCESS
FOR THAT, WHERE BOTH PARTIES

[Captioner] 20:03:05

WOULD NEED TO COME TO AN


[Captioner] 20:03:09
AGREEMENT TO TERMINATE THE
CONTRACT, THE CONTRACT WOULD

[Captioner] 20:03:11
 BE
PASSED ON TO ANY SUCCESSORS OF


[Captioner] 20:03:13
THAT PROPERTY.
>> Councilmember Campbell:


[Captioner] 20:03:13
OKAY.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:03:19
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
ANY CLARIFYING QUESTIONS?


[Captioner] 20:03:22
VICE MAYOR COX.
>> Vice Mayor Cox:

[Captioner] 20:03:25
 I WAS JUST
GOING TO SAY I WOULD LIKE TO


[Captioner] 20:03:28
HEAR FROM THE APPLICANT SO I CAN
GET THE FULL PICTURE OF THE

[Captioner] 20:03:28

PROPOSAL.


[Captioner] 20:03:30
THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY.


[Captioner] 20:03:33
THANK YOU.
SO AT THIS TIME, I'D LIKE

[Captioner] 20:03:34
 TO
CONTINUE WITH THE PRESENTATION


[Captioner] 20:03:36
AS THE APPLICANT HAS A
PRESENTATION.


[Captioner] 20:03:39
AND I THINK -- YES, THANK YOU
FOR STARTING IT.


[Captioner] 20:03:43
AND I THINK PRESENTING WILL BE

[Captioner] 20:03:46

TERRY WONG FROM ROBSON HOMES.


[Captioner] 20:03:49
WELCOME.


[Captioner] 20:03:54
>> GOOD EVENING, MAYOR MEI AND
COUNCILMEMBERS.


[Captioner] 20:03:55
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND
CONSIDERATION.


[Captioner] 20:04:00
CONSIDERING -- REGARDING TONIGHT'S AGENDA ITEM

[Captioner] 20:04:02

TO REQUEST A MILLS ACT CONTRACT


[Captioner] 20:04:05
FOR THE OLD MISSION SAN JOSÉ
SCHOOL BUILDING.


[Captioner] 20:04:07
MY NAME IS TERRY WONG WITH
ROBSON HOMES.


[Captioner] 20:04:10
BEFORE I BEGIN MY PRESENTATION,
I WOULD LIKE TO THANK WAYLAND

[Captioner] 20:04:14
 LI
AND MR. PATEL FOR THEIR HELP IN

[Captioner] 20:04:15

GOING THROUGH THE CITY PROCESS


[Captioner] 20:04:19
TO GET US HERE TONIGHT.
I'M GOING TO

[Captioner] 20:04:21
 START OFF WITH SOME
OF THE HISTORY.


[Captioner] 20:04:27
SO

[Captioner] 20:04:31
 THE OLD MISSION SAN JOSÉ
SCHOOL BUILDING HAS BEEN A PART

[Captioner] 20:04:33

OF FREMONT'S MISSION SCHOOL


[Captioner] 20:04:37
DISTRICT -- OR MISSION SAN JOSÉ
DISTRICT FOR

[Captioner] 20:04:40
 110 YEARS.
ORIGINALLY CONSTRUCTED IN

[Captioner] 20:04:42
 1913,
THE BUILDING WAS THE THIRD


[Captioner] 20:04:44
SCHOOL BUILDING FOR THE MISSION
SAN JOSÉ AREA.


[Captioner] 20:04:48
IT SERVED AS A SCHOOL FOR
42 YEARS,

[Captioner] 20:04:51
 UNTIL 1955.
FROM

[Captioner] 20:04:55
 1956 TO 1968, THE BUILDING
WAS

[Captioner] 20:04:57
 REPURPOSED AS AN OFFICE
BUILDING.


[Captioner] 20:05:00
MORE SPECIFICALLY, IT WAS THE
CITY HALL OFFICES

[Captioner] 20:05:03
 FOR THE NEW BY
INCORPORATED CITY OF FREMONT.


[Captioner] 20:05:12
AFTER 1968, THE BUILDING WAS
AGAIN REPURPOSED AND REMODELED

[Captioner] 20:05:13

AS COMMERCIAL RETAIL SPACE,


[Captioner] 20:05:15
WHERE IT HOUSED LOCAL BUSINESSES
FOR 30 YEARS.


[Captioner] 20:05:20
RECOGNIZING THE BUILDING'S
HISTORIC SIGNIFICANCE TO THE


[Captioner] 20:05:24
CITY OF FREMONT, THE CITY LISTED
THE BUILDING ON

[Captioner] 20:05:26
 FREMONT'S
REGISTER OF HISTORIC RESOURCES


[Captioner] 20:05:29
IN 1991.


[Captioner] 20:05:32
IN 1998, ROBSON HOMES PROPOSED
THAT THE BUILDING

[Captioner] 20:05:34
 BE AGAIN
REPURPOSED.


[Captioner] 20:05:37
THIS TIME INTO LIVE/WORK

[Captioner] 20:05:41
 LOFT.
AT THE TIME THE BUILDING WAS


[Captioner] 20:05:44
85 YEARS OLD AND AS PART OF THE
EFFORT, THE STRUCTURE WAS


[Captioner] 20:05:46
REHABILITATED IN CONFORMANCE
WITH THE SECRETARY OF INTERIOR


[Captioner] 20:05:51
STANDARD FOR REHABILITATION.
THE REHABILITATION OF

[Captioner] 20:05:53
 THE
BUILDING WAS COMPLETED IN 2001,


[Captioner] 20:05:57
AND THE OLD SCHOOL HAS SERVED AS

[Captioner] 20:05:58

SLIF/WORK LOTS OF SINCE THEN.


[Captioner] 20:06:05
IN 2007, ROBSON

[Captioner] 20:06:08
 HOMES CAME BACK
AND

[Captioner] 20:06:11
 PUT A PARCEL MAP OR TRACT

[Captioner] 20:06:15

MAP ON THE PROPERTY IN ORDER TO

[Captioner] 20:06:18

MAKE THE LIVE/WORK LOFT INTO

[Captioner] 20:06:19

CONDOMINIUMS, BUT WE HAVE NOT


[Captioner] 20:06:22
DONE THAT AS OF YET.


[Captioner] 20:06:26
WE STILL OWN THE PROPERTY UNDER
AN

[Captioner] 20:06:30
 LLC.


[Captioner] 20:06:37
TONIGHT'S HEARING IS TO CONSIDER
A MILLS ACT CONTRACT FOR

[Captioner] 20:06:39
 THE OLD
MISSION SAN JOSÉ SCHOOL


[Captioner] 20:06:41
BUILDING.
THE MILLS ACT WAS ENACTED ABOUT


[Captioner] 20:06:44
I THE STATE IN 1972 AND AMENDED

[Captioner] 20:06:46

IN 1984 AS AN INCENTIVE TO


[Captioner] 20:06:49
FACILITATE THE MAINTENANCE AND
PRESERVATION OF QUALIFIED


[Captioner] 20:06:51
HISTORIC BUILDINGS.
THE COST OF MAINTENANCE OF


[Captioner] 20:06:54
HISTORIC STRUCTURES IN A MANNER
THAT RESERVES THEIR HISTORIC


[Captioner] 20:06:57
INTEGRITY IS EXPENSIVE.
THOUGHTFUL CARE IS NEEDED

[Captioner] 20:06:59
 TO
ENSURE THAT THE CHARACTER


[Captioner] 20:07:03
DEFINING FEATURES ARE PRESERVED
AND IN GOOD CONDITION

[Captioner] 20:07:05
.
THE MILLS ACT CONTRACT PROVIDES


[Captioner] 20:07:08
THE OWNER WITH A FINANCIAL TAX
INCENTIVE TO HELP

[Captioner] 20:07:12
 DEFRAY SOME OF
THE HIGHER MAINTENANCE COSTS


[Captioner] 20:07:15
REQUIRED AND IT PROVIDES THE
CITY WITH THE ABILITY TO

[Captioner] 20:07:18

EXERCISE OVERSIGHT AND


[Captioner] 20:07:21
ENFORCEMENT REGARDING THE
BUILDING'S PRESERVATION.


[Captioner] 20:07:25
IT HAS NOW BEEN OVER 20 YEARS
SINCE

[Captioner] 20:07:28
 THE REHABILITATION OF THE
BUILDING HAS BEEN COMPLETED

[Captioner] 20:07:31
 AND
ONGOING MAINTENANCE IS NECESSARY


[Captioner] 20:07:34
TO UPKEEP THE BUILDING.
THE

[Captioner] 20:07:37
 MILLS ACT CONTRACT WILL HELP
ENSURE THE PRESERVATION

[Captioner] 20:07:40
 OF THE
MISSION SAN JOSÉ SCHOOL BUILDING


[Captioner] 20:07:44
IN ITS CURRENT HISTORIC FORM.
AND

[Captioner] 20:07:47
 THE MILLS ACT CONTRACTS ARE
ALSO

[Captioner] 20:07:51
 TRANSFERABLE SO IF AT A

[Captioner] 20:07:54
 CERTAIN POINT IN TIME IN
THE FUTURE WE

[Captioner] 20:07:57
 DID UTILIZE THE
CONDO PLAN, THEN THERE WOULD BE

[Captioner] 20:08:00

A MANAGEMENT LIKE AN HOA THAT

[Captioner] 20:08:04

WOULD BE

[Captioner] 20:08:07
 UNDER THE CONTRACT AND
REQUIRED WITH THE OWNERS OF EACH


[Captioner] 20:08:10
OF THE PROPERTIES TO MAINTAIN
THE HISTORIC CHARACTER OF

[Captioner] 20:08:12
 THE
BUILDING.


[Captioner] 20:08:21
SO TONIGHT WE'RE ASKING CITY
COUNCIL TO TAKE THIS LAST STEP


[Captioner] 20:08:25
TO

[Captioner] 20:08:27
 PRESERVE THIS
FREMONT HISTORIC RESOURCE BY


[Captioner] 20:08:30
APPROVING A MILLS CONTRACT.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:08:33
AT THIS TIME I'LL TURN IT BACK
OVER

[Captioner] 20:08:37
 TO THE COUNCIL,

[Captioner] 20:08:38
 AND WE ALSO
HAVE A PUBLIC HEARING.


[Captioner] 20:08:40
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN.
>> Councilmember Salwan: THANK


[Captioner] 20:08:41
YOU, MADAME MAYOR.
THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION.


[Captioner] 20:08:45
THAT EXPLAINED A LOT.
JUST A

[Captioner] 20:08:49
 QUESTION, WHAT DID YOU
MEAN BY THE CONDO MAP, SO

[Captioner] 20:08:51

BASICALLY ARE PEOPLE LIVING


[Captioner] 20:08:53
THERE ALREADY?
OR YOU HAVEN'T INDIVIDUALLY


[Captioner] 20:08:56
SEPARATED THE CONDOS?


[Captioner] 20:09:02
>> THEY ARE LEGALLY SEPARATED AS
A

[Captioner] 20:09:05
 PARCEL CONDO SPACE.
BUT SINCE WE OWN ALL OF

[Captioner] 20:09:09
 THEM, WE
RENT THEM OUT AS LIVE/WORK LOTS


[Captioner] 20:09:12
OF.
>> Councilmember Salwan: SO IF


[Captioner] 20:09:15
THEY WOULD BE SOLID
INDIVIDUALLY, THEN EACH ONE OF


[Captioner] 20:09:17
THOSE CONDOS WOULD GET A PORTION
OF THIS MILLS ACT.


[Captioner] 20:09:20
IS THAT WHAT YOU WERE SAYING?
>> YES, BECAUSE THEY WOULD BE

[Captioner] 20:09:21

UNDERNEATH DB THEY WOULD


[Captioner] 20:09:25
PROBABLY BE -- THERE WOULD BE AN
OWNERSHIP

[Captioner] 20:09:28
 ENTITY OF THE
BUILDING, THAT WOULD

[Captioner] 20:09:31
 HAVE TO
MAINTAIN THE BUILDING PER THE


[Captioner] 20:09:32
MILLS ACT.
>> Councilmember Salwan: AND


[Captioner] 20:09:35
THAT WOULD BE LIKE AN HOA?
>> YES.


[Captioner] 20:09:36
>> Councilmember Salwan: GOT
IT.


[Captioner] 20:09:37
THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:09:41
VICE MAYOR COX.


[Captioner] 20:09:43
>> Vice Mayor Cox: THANK YOU
FOR THE PRESENTATION.


[Captioner] 20:09:45
I APPRECIATE THE HARD WORK PUT
INTO IT.


[Captioner] 20:09:49
I WANTED TO ASK A QUESTION, A
COUPLE OF THEM.


[Captioner] 20:09:53
ONE IS EVEN THOUGH IT CONSIDERED

[Captioner] 20:09:57

HISTORICAL AND CITY OF FREMONT


[Captioner] 20:10:01
HAS THE OVERSIGHT, IS THERE WAYS
THAT THE

[Captioner] 20:10:05
 COMMUNITY, LIKE EACH
YEAR WE HAVE THE CHRISTMAS TREE

[Captioner] 20:10:07

LIGHTING FOR MISSION SAN JOSÉ.


[Captioner] 20:10:11
WOULD THAT STILL BE ALLOWED
OUTSIDE OF THE

[Captioner] 20:10:13
 PREMISES OR ARE
THERE RESTRICTIONS IF WE GO INTO


[Captioner] 20:10:16
THIS CONTRACT THAT THE COMMUNITY
COULD NOT ACCESS THE OUTSIDE OF


[Captioner] 20:10:19
THE GROUNDS?
NOT THE INSIDE BUT THE OUTSIDE,


[Captioner] 20:10:22
TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THE CHRISTMAS
TREE LIGHTING EVERY

[Captioner] 20:10:25
 YEAR?
>> THE CONTRACT IS SPECIFICALLY


[Captioner] 20:10:28
FOR THE CHARACTER DEFINING
FEATURES OF THE

[Captioner] 20:10:31
 BUILDING.
THE PROPERTY OWNERS STILL HAVE A


[Captioner] 20:10:35
RIGHT TO ALLOW THOSE ACTIVITY.


[Captioner] 20:10:38
>> Vice Mayor Cox: OKAY, SO

[Captioner] 20:10:40

WHAT I'M HEARING FROM YOU IS


[Captioner] 20:10:42
THAT THERE'S NO OUTSIDE
COMMUNITY RESTRICTIONS?


[Captioner] 20:10:43
>> CORRECT.
>> Vice Mayor Cox: OKAY.


[Captioner] 20:10:47
BECAUSE WE ENJOY THAT EVERY
YEAR, AND IT FUN AND BRING

[Captioner] 20:10:51
 THE
FAMILY AND KIDS OUT

[Captioner] 20:10:53
 FOR
BEAUTIFUL TIMES THERE IN FREMONT


[Captioner] 20:10:56
AT THAT FACILITY.
ANOTHER QUESTION I

[Captioner] 20:11:00
 HAD WAS,
ROOFING

[Captioner] 20:11:03
 WAS KIND OF DEFERRED
UNTIL

[Captioner] 20:11:05
 2029, AND I THOUGHT THAT
WAS A LITTLE BIT TOO LONG FOR


[Captioner] 20:11:08
THAT TYPE OF BUILDING, BUT COULD
YOU EXPLAIN

[Captioner] 20:11:12
 A LITTLE BIT MORE
THAT WAS KIND OF PUSHED OUT

[Captioner] 20:11:12

BASED ON SOME OF THE INFORMATION


[Captioner] 20:11:16
WE RECEIVED?
>> THE MILLS ACT CONTRACT


[Captioner] 20:11:19
REQUIRES A 10-YEAR PLAN THAT
SHOW

[Captioner] 20:11:23
S THE AREAS OF PRESERVATION

[Captioner] 20:11:25

AND REHABILITATION.


[Captioner] 20:11:33
I THINK IT WOULD BE UP TO THE
OWNERS AND

[Captioner] 20:11:37
 THE CITY WHEN THE
CONTRACT IS IN PLACE

[Captioner] 20:11:40
 TO POSSIBLY
DISCUSS DURING THEIR INSPECTIONS


[Captioner] 20:11:43
IF THEY FEEL LIKE THERE IS AN
AREA THAT

[Captioner] 20:11:46
 IS IN DESPAIR OR IN

[Captioner] 20:11:49

NEED OF WORK

[Captioner] 20:11:53
 THAT WOULD BE PART
OF THE DISCUSSION WITH THE

[Captioner] 20:11:53

CITY.


[Captioner] 20:12:00
ADDITIONALLY, I MEAN, AS A -- AS
THE PROPERTY OWNER, YOU

[Captioner] 20:12:03
 KNOW, IF
WE SEE THAT THE ROOF IS LEAKING,

[Captioner] 20:12:05

JUST BECAUSE IT SAYS YEAR 7 DOES


[Captioner] 20:12:08
NOT MEAN THAT WE'RE GOING TO
WAIT UNTIL YEAR 7.


[Captioner] 20:12:10
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD
TAKE CARE OF IMMEDIATELY.


[Captioner] 20:12:14
>> Vice Mayor Cox: OKAY.
SO I ASSUME THAT SOMETHING LIKE


[Captioner] 20:12:17
THAT IS BASED ON THE INSPECS OF
THE CITY AND OVERSIGHT THAT

[Captioner] 20:12:19
 THEY
WOULD BE REPORTING SOME OF THOSE


[Captioner] 20:12:21
REPORTS BACK AND THEN KIND OF
WORKING THROUGH THAT.


[Captioner] 20:12:24
BUT I WAS JUST LOOKING AT IT AS
THERE WAS A HIGH

[Captioner] 20:12:28
 LEVEL TIMELINE
OF DIFFERENT ACTIVITIES TO

[Captioner] 20:12:30

MAINTAIN IT, SO THAT'S WHY I'M


[Captioner] 20:12:31
JUST ASKING.
>> YES.


[Captioner] 20:12:32
>> Vice Mayor Cox: AND I
APPRECIATE YOU SHARING THAT.


[Captioner] 20:12:37
NOW, AS FAR AS THE GROUNDS, THE
GRASS, AND

[Captioner] 20:12:39
 THE LANDSCAPE AROUND
THERE

[Captioner] 20:12:43
, WHO IS TAKING CARE OF
THAT PART THAT'S AROUND THOSE

[Captioner] 20:12:44

GROUNDS?


[Captioner] 20:12:47
>> THAT IS THE OWNER RIGHT NOW.
>> Vice Mayor Cox: THAT'S


[Captioner] 20:12:50
STILL THE OWNER, EVEN UP TO THE
CURB FOR MISSION SAN JOSÉ?


[Captioner] 20:12:51
>> YES.
>> Vice Mayor Cox: SO


[Captioner] 20:12:55
EVERYTHING IN THAT WHOLE AREA UP
TO THE CURB IS THE PROPERTY

[Captioner] 20:12:56

OWNER'S RESPONSIBILITY?


[Captioner] 20:12:59
>> YEAH, IT'S NOT UNLIKE, I
GUESS,

[Captioner] 20:13:01
 A HOMEOWNER HAVING TO
TAKE CARE OF A SIDEWALK OR A


[Captioner] 20:13:04
STREET TREE.
>> Vice Mayor Cox: OKAY.


[Captioner] 20:13:06
SO JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT I
UNDERSTAND THAT PART.


[Captioner] 20:13:11
THE OTHER QUESTION, MY LAST
QUESTION,

[Captioner] 20:13:15
 IS, IN THE UNFORTUNATE
EVENT THAT WE MAY HAVE TO

[Captioner] 20:13:18

PARTWAYS, WHAT IS THE NOTICE OF


[Captioner] 20:13:20
TERMINATION?
FOR THIS TYPE OF CONTRACT?


[Captioner] 20:13:26
>> SO IF IT'S INITIATED BY THE
APPLICANT, THE REQUIREMENT IS

[Captioner] 20:13:28
 AT
LEAST 90 DAYS PRIOR TO


[Captioner] 20:13:32
EXPIRATION.
IF IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S


[Captioner] 20:13:35
INITIATED BY THE CITY, IT
REQUIRES AT LEAST A 60-DAY


[Captioner] 20:13:36
NOTIFICATION TO THE PARTIES OF
THAT CONTRACT.


[Captioner] 20:13:45
>> Vice Mayor Cox: OKAY.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:13:51
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
AT THIS TIME, I'D LIKE TO OPEN


[Captioner] 20:13:55
THE PUBLIC HEARING FOR COMMENTS
FROM

[Captioner] 20:13:57
 THE -- IF THERE'S ANY
SPEAKER CARDS.


[Captioner] 20:14:01
>> Mr. Quintanilla: YES, WE
HAVE ONE SPEAKER CARD.


[Captioner] 20:14:04
KELLY ABREU.
>> Mayor Mei: AND ALSO IF


[Captioner] 20:14:07
THERE'S ANYONE ON ZOOM, I JUST
WANT TO ANNOUNCE THAT IF ANYBODY


[Captioner] 20:14:10
WANTED TO ADDRESS THE OLD SCHOOL

[Captioner] 20:14:15

MILLS CONTRACT, USE THE RAISE


[Captioner] 20:14:16
HAND OR STAR NINE # IF YOU'RE
DIALING IN.


[Captioner] 20:14:20
WELCOME, KELLY.
>> SO THIS DRAWING SHOWS THERE'S


[Captioner] 20:14:22
A NICE BIG CIRCLE THERE AND
FOCUSED IN WITH COLORS, AND IT


[Captioner] 20:14:25
TELLS YOU EXACTLY

[Captioner] 20:14:29
 WHAT THE STAFF
WANTS YOU TO BE FOCUSED

[Captioner] 20:14:31
 ON.
LOOK INSIDE THIS CIRCLE.


[Captioner] 20:14:35
BUT IF YOU PULL BACK A MOMENT
AND JUST THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU


[Captioner] 20:14:39
JUST HEARD, YOU HEARD ABOUT

[Captioner] 20:14:41
 A
1955 -- THAT MEANS THAT IN 1956


[Captioner] 20:14:45
OR WHENEVER, ALL THE LITTLE
CHILDREN STARTED

[Captioner] 20:14:49
 GOING TO SCHOOL
IN ANOTHER

[Captioner] 20:14:53
 BUILDING, AND MAYBE
THAT WAS A NEW SCHOOL.


[Captioner] 20:14:56
SO THAT WAS WHAT, 65 OR 70 YEARS
AGO?


[Captioner] 20:15:01
AND THAT WOULD BE WHAT WE CALL
NOW MISSION SAN JOSÉ

[Captioner] 20:15:01
 ELEMENTARY
SCHOOL.


[Captioner] 20:15:05
I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY OF YOU HAD
CHILDREN, ONE OF

[Captioner] 20:15:06
 YOU HAD
CHILDREN THERE.


[Captioner] 20:15:09
DO YOU KNOW WHAT A 60-YEAR-OLD

[Captioner] 20:15:12

BUILDING LOOKS LIKE FOR AN

[Captioner] 20:15:13

ELEMENTARY SCHOOL FOR CHILDREN?


[Captioner] 20:15:16
UM, IT GOT TO BE ONE OF THE
OLDER SCHOOLS.


[Captioner] 20:15:20
AND IT LOOKS LIKE 60 YEARS OLD.


[Captioner] 20:15:23
60 YEARS OLD.
THAT'S WHERE THE LITTLE CHILDREN


[Captioner] 20:15:27
5

[Captioner] 20:15:28
 GO TO SCHOOL.
THINK ABOUT THAT.


[Captioner] 20:15:31
AND IF YOU ACTUALLY DRAW THE
LINE THE WAY IT SHOULD BE AND


[Captioner] 20:15:34
YOU LOOK AT THE ENTIRE SCOPE OF
THE PROJECT, THIS

[Captioner] 20:15:36
 PROJECT,
THEY'VE PROBABLY LOST A TON OF


[Captioner] 20:15:39
MONEY ON THIS, YOU KNOW, TRYING
TO FIX OLD

[Captioner] 20:15:42
 BUILDINGS AND
LIVE/WORK AND ALL THESE

[Captioner] 20:15:46
 LOFTY --
THAT'S A PUN -- ALL THESE LOFT

[Captioner] 20:15:50
Y,
YOU KNOW, ARCHITECTURAL GOALS

[Captioner] 20:15:53

AND IDEALS THAT THEY BUILT,


[Captioner] 20:15:55
THAT'S EXPENSIVE.
SO WHAT DID THEY DO?


[Captioner] 20:15:58
THEY MADE MONEY BY BUILDING ALL
THESE OTHER UNITS AROUND HERE,

[Captioner] 20:16:00

SEE, BACK TOWARDS THE WEST.


[Captioner] 20:16:03
LOTS AND LOTS OF UNITS.
AND WHAT ARE THESE UNITS?


[Captioner] 20:16:06
THEY'RE MORE OR LESS
SINGLE-FAMILY RESIDENCES OR


[Captioner] 20:16:07
ATTACHED HOMES, WHATEVER THEY
ARE.


[Captioner] 20:16:10
I LOOKED AT THE DENSITY.
DENSITY IS 10 UNITS AN ACRE.


[Captioner] 20:16:13
THIS IS THE TYPICAL MISSION

[Captioner] 20:16:16

SAN JOSÉ POLICY, THE TYPICAL


[Captioner] 20:16:20
FREMONT PRACTICE OF
UNDERDEVELOPMENT OF LOW DENSITY

[Captioner] 20:16:22

DEVELOPMENT, ESPECIALLY COMMON


[Captioner] 20:16:25
IN MISSION HSIEH.
IT A DISASTER, AND THAT'S WHY


[Captioner] 20:16:28
WE'VE GOTTEN TO WHERE WE ARE
TODAY WITH MISSION SAN JOSÉ


[Captioner] 20:16:31
GOING DOWN THE TUBES BECAUSE OF
LOW DENSITY HOUSING DEVELOPMENT,

[Captioner] 20:16:33

AND EACH THIS PROJECT THAT WE


[Captioner] 20:16:37
ARE SO PROUD OF, 10 UNITS AN
ACRE, THIS

[Captioner] 20:16:38
 IS ACROSS THE STREET
FROM A JUNIOR COLLEGE.


[Captioner] 20:16:41
THIS IS IN THE MIDDLE OF -- NEAR
A TOWN CENTER.


[Captioner] 20:16:44
THIS SHOULD BE, YOU

[Captioner] 20:16:46
 KNOW, FAIRLY
HIGH, MEDIUM DENSITY AT LEAST.


[Captioner] 20:16:50
MEDIUM DENSITY WOULD BE WHAT,
ABOUT 20 UNITS AN ACRE AND


[Captioner] 20:16:53
UPWARDS OF THAT IF WE REALLY
WANTED TO

[Captioner] 20:16:55
 DO -- TO ACHIEVE THE
DENSITIES THAT ARE NEEDED HERE,


[Captioner] 20:16:58
AND NEEDED ALL OVER FREMONT.
WE CAN'T KEEP DOING THIS.


[Captioner] 20:17:00
WE HAVE TO BUILD HIGHER
DENSITY.


[Captioner] 20:17:03
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:17:08
>> Mr. Quintanilla: WE HAVE NO
ADDITIONAL SPEAKERS.


[Captioner] 20:17:10
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
AT THIS TIME I'D LIKE TO CLOSE


[Captioner] 20:17:13
THE PUBLIC HEARING AND I'D LIKE
TO THEN TURN IT BACK TO THE


[Captioner] 20:17:17
COUNCIL.
IF THERE'S

[Captioner] 20:17:20
 ANY -- ALSO I WOULD
LIKE TO

[Captioner] 20:17:23
 ACTUALLY -- IF THERE ARE
ANY QUESTIONS,

[Captioner] 20:17:25
 OTHERWISE DOES
THE APPLICANT HAVE ANY


[Captioner] 20:17:29
REBUTTAL?
I THINK THEY'RE

[Captioner] 20:17:30
 GIVEN 5 MINUTES
TO REBUTTAL.


[Captioner] 20:17:35
>> NO COMMENTS ABOUT DENSITY.


[Captioner] 20:17:38
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:17:40
AND NOW WE TURN IT BACK TO THE
COUNCIL FOR DISCUSSION.


[Captioner] 20:17:43
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN.


[Captioner] 20:17:47
>> Councilmember Salwan: IS IT
OKAY TO GO AHEAD WITH COMMENTS


[Captioner] 20:17:48
NOW?
>> Mayor Mei: SURE, YES,


[Captioner] 20:17:48
PLEASE.
>> Councilmember Salwan:


[Captioner] 20:17:52
GREAT.
I THINK THIS IS A


[Captioner] 20:17:55
GOODWIN-WIN-WIN FOR THE
COMMUNITY, FOR THE CITY AS WELL

[Captioner] 20:17:56

AS THE PROPERTY OWNER.


[Captioner] 20:18:00
AND THIS IS A HISTORIC

[Captioner] 20:18:04
 SITE.
IT'S A GREAT PLACE WHERE THE

[Captioner] 20:18:07

COMMUNITY CONGREGATES AND FOR

[Captioner] 20:18:10

MISSION SAN JOSÉ IT'S A STANDARD


[Captioner] 20:18:12
FIXTURE.
WE WANT TO MAINTAIN THIS


[Captioner] 20:18:15
PROPERTY, WE WANT TO MAKE SURE
IT'S WELL MAINTAINED AND

[Captioner] 20:18:17
 CARED
FOR GENERATIONS, SO I THINK THIS


[Captioner] 20:18:20
IS DEFINITELY A GOOD USE OF
TAXPAYER RESOURCES AND

[Captioner] 20:18:22
 TO MAKE
SURE THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO


[Captioner] 20:18:25
MAINTAIN THIS PROJECT.
SO I

[Captioner] 20:18:28
 WOULD SUPPORT THIS.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:18:32
VICE MAYOR COX.


[Captioner] 20:18:36
I'M SORRY, YOUR MIC WAS OFF.
>> Vice Mayor Cox: SORRY.


[Captioner] 20:18:39
I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A MOTION TO
MOVE FORWARD WITH

[Captioner] 20:18:39
 THE
RECOMMENDATIONS.


[Captioner] 20:18:41
>> Councilmember Salwan: I
SECOND.


[Captioner] 20:18:42
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
WE HAVE A MOTION AND SECOND.


[Captioner] 20:18:47
PLEASE VOTE.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:18:55
>> Mr. Quintanilla:
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN?


[Captioner] 20:19:03
>> Mayor Mei: THE MOTION
PASSES UNANIMOUSLY WITH

[Captioner] 20:19:04

COUNCILMEMBER KENG BEING


[Captioner] 20:19:04
ABSENT.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:19:08
AND I DO AGREE, I THINK THAT
MANY PEOPLE

[Captioner] 20:19:11
 ENJOY THE FACILITIES

[Captioner] 20:19:14

AND PRESERVING THE ARCHITECTURE


[Captioner] 20:19:17
WILL BE A WONDERFUL BLESSING FOR
US TO LOOK AT

[Captioner] 20:19:18
 FOR GENERATIONS TO
COME.


[Captioner] 20:19:21
NEXT ON OUR AGENDA IS

[Captioner] 20:19:25
 THE FIRST
PUBLIC HEARING ON FISCAL YEAR


[Captioner] 20:19:26
2023/24 PROPOSED OPERATING
BUDGET.


[Captioner] 20:19:28
I BELIEVE THIS EVENING WE HAVE
DIRECTOR PERSSELIN.


[Captioner] 20:19:40
AND THERE'S NO PRESENTATION.
IT WAS SHARED A FEW WEEKS

[Captioner] 20:19:42
 AGO,
BUT ALSO AT THE SAME TIME, I


[Captioner] 20:19:45
WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE

[Captioner] 20:19:46

ESPECIALLY OUR COUNCILMEMBERS


[Captioner] 20:19:48
HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR
QUESTIONS.


[Captioner] 20:19:52
AND ALSO THE OPPORTUNITY FOR
PUBLIC HEARING.


[Captioner] 20:19:59
ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE
COUNCIL ON

[Captioner] 20:20:01
 THE PROPOSED BUDGET
FOR OPERATING BUDGET?


[Captioner] 20:20:05
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN.
>> Councilmember Kassan: THANK


[Captioner] 20:20:09
YOU.
I GOT SOME COMMENTS ABOUT THE

[Captioner] 20:20:13

BUDGET FOR ANIMAL SERVICES AND

[Captioner] 20:20:16

IT'S BEEN A HISTORICALLY

[Captioner] 20:20:18
 REALLY
UNDERFUNDED, UNDERSTAFFED


[Captioner] 20:20:21
PROGRAM AND I'M JUST WONDERING
IF WE COULD GET SOME DETAIL ON


[Captioner] 20:20:22
THE THINKING BEHIND THE BUDGET
FOR THAT.


[Captioner] 20:20:37
>> Mayor Mei: I BELIEVE YOU
MIGHT BE REFERENCING --


[Captioner] 20:20:39
>> Mr. Persselin: I'M NOT SURE
THAT I CAN ANSWER YOUR QUESTION


[Captioner] 20:20:42
TO ANY GREAT DEGREE OF DETAIL.
THE ANIMAL

[Captioner] 20:20:46
 SERVICES BUDGET IS

[Captioner] 20:20:50

LARGELY STAFFING-RELATED,

[Captioner] 20:20:53
 AND SO
WE HAVE

[Captioner] 20:20:57
 PROPOSED A BUDGET THAT
WILL MAINTAIN THE

[Captioner] 20:21:00
 STAFFING AT
ITS CURRENT LEVELS

[Captioner] 20:21:03
 AND MAINTAIN
THE SERVICE LEVEL AT

[Captioner] 20:21:05
 AT ITS
CURRENT LEVEL, AND I THINK I


[Captioner] 20:21:08
WOULD HAVE TO DEFER TO THE
ANIMAL SERVICES MANAGER

[Captioner] 20:21:12
 OR THE
POLICE CHIEF

[Captioner] 20:21:16
 TO DISCUSS ANYTHING
MORE IN DETAIL WITH RESPECT

[Captioner] 20:21:20
 TO,
YOU KNOW, STRATEGIC PLANS FOR

[Captioner] 20:21:21

THE --


[Captioner] 20:21:23
>> Councilmember Kassan: DO
YOU KNOW IF THERE WAS -- OH,


[Captioner] 20:21:26
SORRY, GO AHEAD.
>> City Mgr. Shackelford: I


[Captioner] 20:21:29
WAS JUST GOING TO ASK IF CHIEF
WASHINGTON MAY

[Captioner] 20:21:32
 HAVE SOME
COLOR/COMMENTARY TO ADD TO


[Captioner] 20:21:34
WHAT'S HAPPENING AT THE ANIMAL
SHELTER.


[Captioner] 20:21:40
>> HI, KARENA.
THIS IS CHIEF WASHINGTON.


[Captioner] 20:21:42
CAN YOU HEAR ME?
>> City Mgr. Shackelford: YES,


[Captioner] 20:21:43
YOU'RE GOOD.
>> OKAY, YES.


[Captioner] 20:21:47
I DIDN'T KNOW IF THERE WAS A
SPECIFIC -- FIRST OF ALL, GOOD


[Captioner] 20:21:50
EVENING, EVERYONE.
I DIDN'T KNOW IF THERE WAS A


[Captioner] 20:21:53
SPECIFIC QUESTION REGARDING

[Captioner] 20:21:56
 THE
BUDGET AND LIKE

[Captioner] 20:21:59
 WAS IT
STAFFING-RELATED OR


[Captioner] 20:22:02
SERVICE-RELATED AS FAR AS THE
QUESTION THAT

[Captioner] 20:22:04
 THE COUNCILMEMBER
HAD?


[Captioner] 20:22:07
>> Councilmember Kassan: YEAH,
I HEAR SO OFTEN THAT THERE'S A


[Captioner] 20:22:10
REAL LACK OF SUFFICIENT
STAFFING, THERE ISN'T, LIKE, AN

[Captioner] 20:22:15

ON-STAFF VETERINARIAN, SO I'M


[Captioner] 20:22:18
JUST WONDERING, WAS THERE ANY
REQUEST TO INCREASE THE BUDGET


[Captioner] 20:22:21
TO ADD MORE STAFF AND, YOU KNOW,
IS THERE ANY WAY THAT

[Captioner] 20:22:23
 THAT COULD
BE CONSIDERED?


[Captioner] 20:22:28
>> SO THERE WAS NO REQUEST TO
INCREASE

[Captioner] 20:22:31
 THE STAFF.
PART OF THE ISSUE RIGHT NOW IS


[Captioner] 20:22:35
WE DON'T HAVE -- WE'RE
CHALLENGEED WITH

[Captioner] 20:22:38
 EVEN GETTING --
HIRING THE STAFF THAT WE'VE BEEN

[Captioner] 20:22:41

AUTHORIZED FOR, SO AS YOU MIGHT


[Captioner] 20:22:46
KNOW, OVER THE LAST YEAR, WE DID
ADD A FEW STAFF POSITIONS

[Captioner] 20:22:50
, AN
ANIMAL SERVICE SUPERVISOR,

[Captioner] 20:22:53
 AND
SOME MORE POSITIONS THAT WE HAVE


[Captioner] 20:22:56
STRUGGLED TO EVEN FILL THOSE
POSITIONS, SO WE DO HAVE A

[Captioner] 20:22:58

PART-TIME VETERINARIAN THAT


[Captioner] 20:23:02
WORKS NOW AND AS IT STANDS

[Captioner] 20:23:06
 AT
THIS CURRENT

[Captioner] 20:23:08
 TIME, WE BELIEVE
THAT OUR STAFFING IS ADEQUATE IF


[Captioner] 20:23:11
WE CAN GET FULLY STAFFED.
AND THEN WE CAN TAKE IT FROM


[Captioner] 20:23:14
THERE.
BUT YOU KNOW, ADDING STAFF AT


[Captioner] 20:23:17
THIS POINT WHEN WE HAVE SUCH A

[Captioner] 20:23:20

SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE, I'M NOT


[Captioner] 20:23:23
SURE WE CAN MAKE A FAIR
ASSESSMENT ON WHAT WE NEED


[Captioner] 20:23:26
BECAUSE WE CAN'T EVEN GET UP TO
OUR STAFFING

[Captioner] 20:23:28
 LEVELS THAT WE HAVE
AUTHORIZED ALREADY.


[Captioner] 20:23:31
>> Councilmember Kassan: ALL
RIGHT, THAT MAKES SENSE.


[Captioner] 20:23:34
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
>> Mayor

[Captioner] 20:23:35
 Mei: THANK YOU.
COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL.


[Captioner] 20:23:41
>> Councilmember Campbell: I'M
GOING TO ASK THE DREADED


[Captioner] 20:23:45
QUESTION ABOUT AN
ARBORIST.


[Captioner] 20:23:48
IS THAT BUDGETED IN OUR BUDGET?
I DIDN'T SEE IT ANYWHERE,

[Captioner] 20:23:51
 I MAY
HAVE MISSED IT, BUT I KNOW THAT


[Captioner] 20:23:54
THERE'S BEEN SOME OUTPOUR ABOUT
US BEING ABLE TO HAVE ONE.


[Captioner] 20:23:57
>> Mr. Persselin: SO THE
PROPOSED BUDGET DOES INCLUDE THE

[Captioner] 20:24:00

ADDITION OF

[Captioner] 20:24:05
 -- I THINK WHAT
YOU'RE REFERRING TO IS THE

[Captioner] 20:24:09

ARBORIST, AND THE BUDGET ALSO

[Captioner] 20:24:12

INCLUDES A NET ZERO CHANGE

[Captioner] 20:24:15
 IN
POSITIONS THAT CREATES A CITY


[Captioner] 20:24:19
LANDSCAPE MANAGER, WHICH IS
ANOTHER

[Captioner] 20:24:22
 ASPECT OF, I THINK,
CONCERN TO THE FOLKS THAT

[Captioner] 20:24:23
 WERE
LOOKING FOR THE ARBORIST.


[Captioner] 20:24:27
BUT YES, WE ARE ADDING

[Captioner] 20:24:31
 THAT
POSITION IN THE PROPOSED BUDGET.


[Captioner] 20:24:32
>> Councilmember Campbell:
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:24:35
>> Councilmember Kassan: CAN I
DO A QUICK FOLLOW-UP ON THAT?


[Captioner] 20:24:38
IS THAT THE POSITION THAT WE'RE
CALLING LIKE THE URBAN

[Captioner] 20:24:41
 FORESTRY,
THE PERSON WHO WILL MANAGE THE


[Captioner] 20:24:44
URBAN FORESTRY PROGRAM?
>> Mr. Persselin: SO THERE'S


[Captioner] 20:24:49
AN URBAN FORESTER AS WHAT PEOPLE
ARE THINKING

[Captioner] 20:24:52
 OF AS THE ARBORIST
AND THERE'S ALSO AN

[Captioner] 20:24:54
 URBAN
LANDSCAPE MANAGER, WHICH IS THE


[Captioner] 20:24:58
NET ZERO ADD DROP.
>> Councilmember Kassan: SO


[Captioner] 20:25:00
THERE IS ONE ADDITIONAL POSITION
BEING ADDED?


[Captioner] 20:25:01
AWESOME.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:25:06
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
NEXT

[Captioner] 20:25:09
 IS VICE MAYOR COX.


[Captioner] 20:25:14
>> Vice Mayor Cox: I WAS JUST
GOING TO TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE

[Captioner] 20:25:18

REGARDING COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN'S

[Captioner] 20:25:20

QUESTIONS REGARDING THE ANIMAL


[Captioner] 20:25:24
SERVICES, AND FROM FIRSTHAND, A
LOT OF OUR

[Captioner] 20:25:27
 COUNTIES ARE
EXPERIENCING SHORTAGES FOR STAFF

[Captioner] 20:25:29

AS WELL AT THE COUNTY LEVELS


[Captioner] 20:25:32
AROUND THE BAY AREA, AND WE'VE

[Captioner] 20:25:35

HAD TO -- AND I CAN SPEAK


[Captioner] 20:25:38
PERSONALLY IN BEING ABLE TO PUT
A LOT OF EMERGENCY ORDERS IN


[Captioner] 20:25:41
EVEN TO HIRE ON CALL OVER

[Captioner] 20:25:43

PART-TIME BASIS JUST


[Captioner] 20:25:45
VETERINARIANS MORE OR LESS THAN
STAFFING.


[Captioner] 20:25:49
SO IT A ACROSS

[Captioner] 20:25:53
 THE BAY AREA
SITUATION THAT'S GOING ON THAT'S


[Captioner] 20:25:57
STILL PREVALENT.
YOU HAVE THE FUNDING

[Captioner] 20:25:59
 BUT WE
CAN'T FIND THE PEOPLE, AND IT'S


[Captioner] 20:26:01
TAKING A LOT TO BE ABLE TO DO
THAT.


[Captioner] 20:26:04
BUT I JUST WANTED TO SHARE THAT

[Captioner] 20:26:04

FROM INDUSTRY KNOWLEDGE


[Captioner] 20:26:08
FIRSTHAND.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:26:13
NEXT, SPEAKING OF INDUSTRY
KNOWLEDGE, I THINK COUNCILMEMBER

[Captioner] 20:26:15

SALWAN AS A VETERINARIAN.


[Captioner] 20:26:22
>> Councilmember Salwan: IT'S
A HUGE

[Captioner] 20:26:25
 ISSUE, ESPECIALLY IN
CALIFORNIA AND ALL OVER THE


[Captioner] 20:26:28
NATION.
THERE'S A HUGE VETERINARY


[Captioner] 20:26:30
SHORTAGE.
THERE'S PLACES -- PRIVATE PLACES


[Captioner] 20:26:33
THAT ARE BEING CLOSED AND THOSE
ARE MORE GLAMOROUS, AND WHEN YOU


[Captioner] 20:26:36
HAVE A SHELTER VETERINARIAN,
IT'S VERY RESTRICTED IN WHAT


[Captioner] 20:26:39
THEY CAN DO.
AND SO I THINK PEOPLE ARE

[Captioner] 20:26:41

BEGGING FOR VETERINARIANS.


[Captioner] 20:26:44
THERE'S JUST A HUGE SHORTAGE AND
IT'S PRIMARILY DUE TO

[Captioner] 20:26:46
 THE COVID
PANDEMIC.


[Captioner] 20:26:49
YOU KNOW, THE AMOUNT OF PETS
THAT INCREASED WAS OVER 30% IN

[Captioner] 20:26:52

JUST A SHORT PERIOD, BUT THE


[Captioner] 20:26:55
NUMBER OF VETERINARIANS HAVE NOT
INCREASED THAT MUCH, IN FACT,


[Captioner] 20:26:57
MANY RETIRED, ESPECIALLY DURING
COVID.


[Captioner] 20:27:00
SO THE VETERINARY SCHOOLS ARE
WORKING OVERTIME TRYING TO


[Captioner] 20:27:02
INCREASE THAT BUT THAT'S LIKE
WE'RE THREE, FOUR YEARS AWAY, SO


[Captioner] 20:27:06
I THINK IT'S NOT JUST HERE, IT'S
LIKE EMERGENCY CLINICS,


[Captioner] 20:27:09
SPECIALTY HOSPITALS, THEY'LL PAY
ANY KIND OF MONEY JUST TO GET A


[Captioner] 20:27:11
VETERINARIAN, SO I THINK IT'S
DEFINITELY -- WE NEED THEM BUT


[Captioner] 20:27:15
IT'S JUST A CHALLENGING TIME.
BUT I DO APPRECIATE THE

[Captioner] 20:27:17
 STAFF
TRYING TO HIRE THEM, TRYING TO


[Captioner] 20:27:20
FILL THE POSITIONS AND SEE HOW
WE CAN MAKE THE

[Captioner] 20:27:21
 SHELTER
OPERATIONAL.


[Captioner] 20:27:22
THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:27:27
COUNCILMEMBER COX, VICE MAYOR
COX, IS THAT FROM BEFORE, YOUR

[Captioner] 20:27:27

BUTTON?


[Captioner] 20:27:28
OKAY.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:27:34
SO AT THIS TIME, I'D LIKE TO
OPEN THE PUBLIC HEARING.


[Captioner] 20:27:37
>> Mr. Quintanilla: WE HAVE
ONE SPEAKER CARD.


[Captioner] 20:27:39
KELLY ABREU.
>> Mayor Mei: WELCOME.


[Captioner] 20:27:49
>> I HOPE ALL OF YOU MEMORIZED
ALL THOSE SLIDES WITH ALL

[Captioner] 20:27:52
 THE
NUMBERS ON THEM, YOU KNOW, THE


[Captioner] 20:27:55
BUDGET SLIDES THAT HAVE COME
ALMOST EVERY YEAR.


[Captioner] 20:27:58
THEY'RE USUALLY ABOUT THE SAME
THING, AND

[Captioner] 20:28:01
 THERE'S USUALLY, YOU
KNOW, SOME

[Captioner] 20:28:05
 STORY, SOME -- AT THE
TOP, BUT

[Captioner] 20:28:07
 LET'S GO THROUGH THOSE
THINGS A LITTLE BIT.


[Captioner] 20:28:11
IF YOU LOOK AT THE

[Captioner] 20:28:14
 GROWTH IN THE
BUDGET OVER THE LAST, YOU KNOW,

[Captioner] 20:28:17

FIVE, SIX, 78 YEARS, IT BEEN


[Captioner] 20:28:20
GROWING LIKE 6% A YEAR.
CITY POPULATION ISN'T

[Captioner] 20:28:23
 GROWING 6%
A YEAR.


[Captioner] 20:28:28
INFLATION WAS PROBABLY A LITTLE
BIT LESS THAN THAT, LOOKING

[Captioner] 20:28:30

BACKWARDS, IT CERTAINLY GOING UP


[Captioner] 20:28:34
NOW.
BUT THE CITY'S SERVICES

[Captioner] 20:28:36
 ARE NOT
BEING PROVIDED BY THE BUDGET,


[Captioner] 20:28:38
THEY'RE MOSTLY -- A LOT OF IT IS
LABOR.


[Captioner] 20:28:42
AND LABOR HAS ONLY BEEN GOING UP
LESS THAN 2% A YEAR.


[Captioner] 20:28:45
THAT'S HOW YOU GET THIS NUMBER
OF VERY FEW PEOPLE

[Captioner] 20:28:46
 PER 10,000
POPULATION.


[Captioner] 20:28:52
IS MORE AND MORE MONEY BUT NOT

[Captioner] 20:28:55

CONCOMITANT IN GROWTH IN THE


[Captioner] 20:28:58
LABOR FORCE.
SO THEN AS A -- THE

[Captioner] 20:29:00
 RESIDENTS
MIGHT ASK, DO WE HAVE ENOUGH


[Captioner] 20:29:03
PEOPLE DOING THE WORK?
COMPARED TO, LET'S

[Captioner] 20:29:05
 SAY, PALO
ALTO, WHERE THEIR LABOR FORCE


[Captioner] 20:29:09
IS, WHAT, PER CAPITA MAYBE TWICE
AS BIG AS OURS?


[Captioner] 20:29:12
ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THIS.
PUBLIC SAFETY, WHICH ON THOSE

[Captioner] 20:29:15

SLIDES IS OUR TOP

[Captioner] 20:29:18
 PRIORITY, OUR

[Captioner] 20:29:21

NEAREST AND DEAREST TO OUR


[Captioner] 20:29:24
HEARTS, PUBLIC SAFETY.
WELL, THAT TAKES THREE QUARTERS


[Captioner] 20:29:27
OF THE BUDGET.


[Captioner] 20:29:31
OKAY, THAT'S YOUR DECISION.
LITERALLY YOUR DECISION.


[Captioner] 20:29:37
BUT TAKE A LOOK AT THE HEAD
COUNTS FOR THE PUBLIC SAFETY.


[Captioner] 20:29:39
WHAT IS THE HEAD COUNT?
IS IT THREE QUARTERS OF THE


[Captioner] 20:29:40
STAFF?
NO.


[Captioner] 20:29:43
IT'S ABOUT HALF THE STAFF.


[Captioner] 20:29:48
IT'S 49% OR SOMETHING, IS IT?
IT'S RIGHT ABOUT HALF.


[Captioner] 20:29:51
SO WE HAVE HALF THE PEOPLE
TAKING UP -- SPENDING THREE


[Captioner] 20:29:53
QUARTERS OF THE MONEY.
WHICH LEAVES YOU ONLY WITH ONE


[Captioner] 20:29:54
QUARTER OF THE MONEY FOR ALL THE
REST OF THE PEOPLE.


[Captioner] 20:29:59
SO THAT'S ANOTHER THING TO
NOTICE HERE.


[Captioner] 20:30:05
SO IT'S REALLY ABOUT LABOR.
AND FOR THOSE OF

[Captioner] 20:30:08
 YOU WHO BELIEVE
THAT MONEY DRIVES THE

[Captioner] 20:30:10
 WORLD,
THEN YOU'VE GOT -- THOSE SLIDES


[Captioner] 20:30:14
ARE VERY CLEAR ABOUT THE MONEY.
BUT THEY'RE NOT SO CLEAR THAT WE

[Captioner] 20:30:17

REALLY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH WORKER

[Captioner] 20:30:20
S
PERHAPS TO DO ALL THE WORK


[Captioner] 20:30:21
THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE.
THANKS.


[Captioner] 20:30:27
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
ARE THERE ANY OTHER SPEAKERS?


[Captioner] 20:30:30
>> Mr. Quintanilla: YES, WE
HAVE ONE SPEAKER ON ZOOM.


[Captioner] 20:30:35
KATHRYN RUBY.


[Captioner] 20:30:37
>> Mayor Mei: WELCOME.
>> HI, THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:30:40
I JUST HAD A COUPLE OF
COMMENTS.


[Captioner] 20:30:46
IN TERMS OF HIRING

[Captioner] 20:30:48
 AN
ARBORIST, I DO WANT TO MAKE SURE


[Captioner] 20:30:52
YOU ACTUALLY HIRE AN ARBORIST
RATHER THAN A TREE SERVICE

[Captioner] 20:30:53

BECAUSE THEY HAVE VERY DIFFERENT


[Captioner] 20:30:57
TRAINING AND I FIND IT CRIMINAL
WHEN A TREE

[Captioner] 20:31:01
 SERVICE IS USED AND
THEY COME IN AND

[Captioner] 20:31:04
 TOP A TREE AND
THEN THE RESULT IS A BAZILLION


[Captioner] 20:31:07
LITTLE BRANCHES COMING OUT OF,
YOU KNOW, WHAT WAS

[Captioner] 20:31:10
 LEFT, AND AN
ARBORIST WOULD NEVER DO THAT.


[Captioner] 20:31:13
SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU
GUYS ARE DEFINITELY

[Captioner] 20:31:14
 HIRING AN
ARBORIST.


[Captioner] 20:31:22
AND THE SECOND THING IS MORE
LIKE A QUESTION

[Captioner] 20:31:25
.
I KNOW YOU GUYS DON'T ANSWER

[Captioner] 20:31:28
 ME,
BUT

[Captioner] 20:31:32
 IS THERE LIKE CONTRACT
VETERINARIANS SORT OF LIKE


[Captioner] 20:31:35
CONTRACT NURSES AND

[Captioner] 20:31:38
 SUCH, OTHER
HEALTHCARE WORKERS, SO THAT

[Captioner] 20:31:40
 IF
THAT EXISTS, HAVE WE TAKEN


[Captioner] 20:31:43
ADVANTAGE OF THAT AS A SOURCE?


[Captioner] 20:31:47
AND THAT IS ALL I HAVE TO

[Captioner] 20:31:54
>> Mayor Mei:   IS THAT OUR LAST 
SPEAKER

[Captioner] 20:31:57
?
>> YES, THAT WAS OUR LAST 


[Captioner] 20:31:59
SPEAKER.
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:32:01
AT THIS TIME I'LL CLOSE THE 
PUBLIC HEARING.


[Captioner] 20:32:04
AND I'D LIKE TO TURN IT BACK TO

[Captioner] 20:32:51

CREEK ROAD?


[Captioner] 20:34:44
IT'S CLOSED TO

[Captioner] 20:34:47
 PASSING BY, NOT

THIS YEAR IN ALIGNMENT WITH THE 


[Captioner] 20:53:26
MULTIYEAR LEGISLATIVE CYCLE THAT

[Captioner] 20:53:29
 REVISED 
FRAMEWORK DOCUMENT THAT FOCUSES 


[Captioner] 20:53:32
WORK IN SUPPORT OF COUNCIL 
DOCUMENTED POLICY PLANS AND 


[Captioner] 20:53:36
RECOMMENDED PRINCIPLES WE ARE 

[Captioner] 20:53:39
 
PROPOSING A MULTIYEAR APPROACH 


[Captioner] 20:53:42
TO OUR WORK.
A CENTRALIZED APPROACH OUT

[Captioner] 20:53:43
 OF 
THE CITY MANAGER'S OFFICE 


[Captioner] 20:53:46
OUTLINED IN THE DOCUMENT AND 
STAFF REPORT IS WORKING WELL AND

[Captioner] 20:53:49
 
WE PROPOSE TO FOCUS TIME AND 


[Captioner] 20:53:51
RESOURCE WREST WE HAVE THE 
GREATEST IMPACT ON CITY 


[Captioner] 20:53:55
FEDERATIONS, SEEKING MORE 
FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES AT THE

[Captioner] 20:53:56
 
STATE AND FEDERAL LEVEL AND 


[Captioner] 20:53:59
COLLABORATING WITH STAKE 
HOLDERS, LEGISLATIVE PARTNERS 


[Captioner] 20:54:02
SUCH AS A LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA 
CITIES OUR LOBBYISTS

[Captioner] 20:54:05
 AND ELECTED 
REPRESENTATIVES WITH A LIMITED 


[Captioner] 20:54:08
SCOPE ON LEGISLATION THAT HAS

[Captioner] 20:54:10
 
OPOTENTIAL IMPACT ON THE CITY.


[Captioner] 20:54:13
WE BELIEVE THE PROGRAM HAS MADE

[Captioner] 20:54:16
 
ARE IMPROVEMENTS OVER THE YEARS 


[Captioner] 20:54:21
AND FURTHER REINFORCES THE 
LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM.

[Captioner] 20:54:23

TIMELY UPDATES TO COUNCIL 


[Captioner] 20:54:26

AS PROVIDING A REGULAR UPDATES 


[Captioner] 20:54:32

[Captioner] 20:54:36

[Captioner] 20:54:39
 TO ANDRES.

>> THANK YOU

 GENEVA.
ANDRE

[Captioner] 20:54:51
S RAMIREZ WITH PUBLIC 
AFFAIRS.


[Captioner] 20:54:54
AS GENEVA MENTIONED, I'M GOING 
TO GIVE YOU A HIGH LEVEL

[Captioner] 20:54:56
 
OVERVIEW OF THE STATE 


[Captioner] 20:54:58
LEGISLATIVE CYCLE, TALK A LITTLE 
BIT ABOUT HOW WE APPROACH 


[Captioner] 20:55:02
ADVOCACY ON BEHALF OF THE CITY 
AND IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE

[Captioner] 20:55:04
 CITY 
AND THEN FINISH OFF TALKING A 


[Captioner] 20:55:07
LITTLE BIT ABOUT SOME OF OUR 
RECENT LEGISLATIVE EFFORTS AND 


[Captioner] 20:55:10
THEN I WILL HAND IT OVER TO 
MS. AMANDA GA

[Captioner] 20:55:13
IO WHO YOU WITH 
WILL ALSO FACTUAL ABOUT SOME OF 


[Captioner] 20:55:15
OUR RECENT BUDGETARY EFFORTS AND 
SUCCESSES.


[Captioner] 20:55:18
SO WITH THAT WE ARE IN THE FIRST 
YEAR OF A TWO

[Captioner] 20:55:21
 YEAR LEGISLATIVE 
CYCLE, THAT IS HOW THE STATE 


[Captioner] 20:55:24
OPERATES SO WE ARE IN THE 2023-

[Captioner] 20:55:25

2023-2024 LEGISLATIVE CYCLE.


[Captioner] 20:55:28
THIS YEAR THERE WERE OVER 2600 
BILLS INTRODUCED

[Captioner] 20:55:31
 BY THE STATE 
LEGISLATURE, OF COURSE THAT 


[Captioner] 20:55:34
SOUNDS LIKE A CRAZY AMOUNT AND 
OVERLOAD AND

[Captioner] 20:55:37
 IT IS.
BUT, YOU KNOW, MANY, MANY OF 


[Captioner] 20:55:40
THEM GET FILL TERD OUT 
THROUGHOUT THE POLICY AND FISCAL

[Captioner] 20:55:42
 
COMMITTEE PROCESS AS WE EMBARK 


[Captioner] 20:55:43
ON THIS TWO YEAR LEGISLATIVE 
CYCLE.


[Captioner] 20:55:52
ONE OF THE QUESTIONS PEOPLE ASK?
WITH SUCH

[Captioner] 20:55:55
 A BILL HEAVY YEAR HOW 
IS IT POSSIBLE THAT ALL OF THIS 


[Captioner] 20:55:58
GOES THROUGH?
THERE ARE FUNDING ALLOCATIONS 


[Captioner] 20:56:01
ASSOCIATED WITH LEGISLATION.
THIS YEAR EMOTIONAL EVER THE 


[Captioner] 20:56:04
BUDGET WILL REALLY BE A 
DETERMINING FACTOR IN THE 


[Captioner] 20:56:07
SUCCESS OR DEFEAT OF MANY 
LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS BECAUSE WE 


[Captioner] 20:56:10
ARE LOOKING AT A SIGNIFICANT 
BUDGET DEFICIT AT THE

[Captioner] 20:56:11
 STATE 
GENERAL FUND LEVEL.


[Captioner] 20:56:14
SO IT'S FAIR TO SAY IF A BILL 
REQUIRES A

[Captioner] 20:56:17
 APPROPRIATION AND 
THERE IS NO APPROPRIATION IN THE 


[Captioner] 20:56:19
BUDGET THE BILL IS NOT 
HAPPENING.


[Captioner] 20:56:22
THAT IS SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE

[Captioner] 20:56:24
 
TO BE SITUATIONALLY AWARE OF.


[Captioner] 20:56:27
NOW VERY RECENTLY, THE BILLS DID 
HAVE TO FACE

[Captioner] 20:56:30
 THEIR HOUSE OF 
ORIGIN,

[Captioner] 20:56:34
 FISCAL EDUCATION 
HEARING, THAT IS

[Captioner] 20:56:38
 A BLACK BOX 
WHERE

[Captioner] 20:56:41
 MANY PIECES OF LEGISLATION 
GOES INTO

[Captioner] 20:56:45
, WE'LL HAVE A SUSPENSE 
FILE

[Captioner] 20:56:47
 HEARING DAY IN WHICH THEY 
WILL ANNOUNCE THE BILLS THAT 


[Captioner] 20:56:49
CONTINUE AND THE BILLS THAT ARE 
HELD.


[Captioner] 20:56:52
FROM THAT IN BOTH THE ASSEMBLY 
AND SENATE EACH OF

[Captioner] 20:56:54
 THEM HELD 
ROUGHLY 30% OF ALL THE 


[Captioner] 20:56:57
LEGISLATION THAT WENT IN THERE.
WE STARTED OUT WITH X AMOUNT

[Captioner] 20:57:00
 OF 
BILLS GOING IN, NOW THERE'S

[Captioner] 20:57:04
 ONLY 
70% LEFT AND THEY'LL

[Captioner] 20:57:06
 CONTINUE TO 
GET WHITTLED DOWN THROUGH THE 


[Captioner] 20:57:09
LEGISLATIVE PROCESS.
RECENTLY THE GOVERNOR 


[Captioner] 20:57:12
HIGHLIGHTED HIS MAY RISKS OF HIS 
JANUARY

[Captioner] 20:57:16
 BUDGET PROPOSAL.
ONE OF THE SIGNIFICANT THINGS

[Captioner] 20:57:19
 IT 
INCLUDES $227 BILLION FOR

[Captioner] 20:57:21
 THE 
GENERAL FUND SPENDING IN THE 


[Captioner] 20:57:22
STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR THIS 
COMING FISCAL YEAR.


[Captioner] 20:57:25
HOWEVER THERE IS A PROJECTED 
31.5 BILLION

[Captioner] 20:57:27
 DOLLAR BUDGET 
SHORTFALL AND SINCE JANUARY, 


[Captioner] 20:57:31
SINCE HE PROPOSED HIS FIRST 
BUDGET IN JANUARY THAT

[Captioner] 20:57:34
 INCREASED 
ROUGHLY $9 BILL

[Captioner] 20:57:37
 BILLION.
SO IT'S QUITE A SIGNIFICANT A 


[Captioner] 20:57:40
AND THOSE ARE THE LATEST, YOU 
KNOW, ESTIMATES FROM THE 


[Captioner] 20:57:43
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE.
HOWEVER, THE LEGISLATIVE 


[Captioner] 20:57:46
ANALYST'S OFFICE PRESUMED IT 
COULD BE AN ADDITIONAL FIVE, $6 


[Captioner] 20:57:50
BILLION MORE THAN THAT.

[Captioner] 20:57:52

ONE OF THE REALITY INTERNET 


[Captioner] 20:57:56
INTERESTING THINGS THIS YEAR AS 
MANY OF YOU KNOW

[Captioner] 20:57:58
 IS THE TAX 
FILING DEADLINE HAS BEEN 


[Captioner] 20:58:02
EXTENDED UNTIL OCTOBER.
SO THAT'S REALLY GOING TO THROWS

[Captioner] 20:58:05
 
A WRENCH INTO EVERYTHING

[Captioner] 20:58:08
, WITH 
REGARD TO HOW THE STATE AND THE 


[Captioner] 20:58:11
GOVERNOR FROACHES BUDGET RIGHT?
WHEN THEY ARE

[Captioner] 20:58:15
 STATUTORILY 
OBLIGATED TO SIGN INTO LAW

[Captioner] 20:58:17
 BY 
JULY 1st THAT IS GOING TO BE A 


[Captioner] 20:58:20
VERY, VERY SHELLY BUDGET FOR 
LACK OF BETTER TERMS.


[Captioner] 20:58:23
IT'S GOING TO BE BASELINE 
PRIORITY PROGRAMS AND OPERATION

[Captioner] 20:58:26

OPERATIONS.


[Captioner] 20:58:29
FUNDING THAT NEED TO HAPPEN IN 
ORDER OR THE BASIC GOVERNANCE

[Captioner] 20:58:31
 
AND, YOU KNOW, THE STATE TO 


[Captioner] 20:58:33
WORK.
BUT ONCE WE GET THE ACCURATE 


[Captioner] 20:58:37
ESTIMATE, WHEN EVERYONE FILES 
THEIR TAXES WHICH WILL BE

[Captioner] 20:58:40
 CLOSER 
TO DECEMBER WHEN WE

[Captioner] 20:58:42
 FIGURE OUT 
THOSE FIGURES THEN THERE WILL BE 


[Captioner] 20:58:45
A NUMBER OF SUBSEQUENT WHAT ARE 
CALLED BUDGET TRAILER BILLS

[Captioner] 20:58:48
.
AND FROM CONVERSATION HE I'VE 


[Captioner] 20:58:51
HAD WITH THE SENATE BUDGET CHAIR 
AND A LOT OF HER KEY AND SENIOR

[Captioner] 20:58:52
 
STAFF THEY'RE THINKING THAT THEY 


[Captioner] 20:58:56
WOULD REVISIT AND DO A LOT OF 
BUDGET CLEANUP IN JANUARY OF 20

[Captioner] 20:58:58

2024 FOR THE BUDGET THAT WAS 


[Captioner] 20:59:00
PASSED THIS YEAR.
AGAIN THERE WILL BE BUDGET 


[Captioner] 20:59:03
TRAILER BILLS THAT COME WEEKS 
AND MONTHS AFTER THIS INITIAL

[Captioner] 20:59:05
 
BUDGET BUT THERE'S GOING TO BE A 


[Captioner] 20:59:07
LOT OF CLEANUP WORK THAT IS 
DONE.


[Captioner] 20:59:10
NOW NEXT SLIDE PLEASE.
HOW WE APPROACH

[Captioner] 20:59:12
 OUR LEGISLATIVE 
ADVOCACY?


[Captioner] 20:59:15
A COUPLE OF KEY FACTORS HERE.
VERY

[Captioner] 20:59:17
 FREQUENT COMMUNICATION WITH 
CITY STAFF.


[Captioner] 20:59:20
AND THAT'S, YOU KNOW, ALMOST 
DAILY BUT DEFINITELY

[Captioner] 20:59:22
 SEVERAL 
TIMES A WEEK WHETHER IT'S 


[Captioner] 20:59:26
WRITTEN WHETHER IT'S PHONE 
CALLS, ZOOM MEETINGS,

[Captioner] 20:59:27
 COMING 
DOWN IN PERSON.


[Captioner] 20:59:31
IT IS REALLY, REALLY CRITICAL 
THAT WE CONTINUE TO COMMUNICATE

[Captioner] 20:59:32
 
FREQUENTLY WITH CITY STAFF TO 


[Captioner] 20:59:35
UNDERSTAND WHAT IS HAPPENING AT 
THE CITY AT ALL TIMES.


[Captioner] 20:59:38
ONE WAY I LIKE TO VIEW MYSELF 
AND HOW WE LIKE

[Captioner] 20:59:41
 TO VIEW 
OURSELVES IN THE LOBBYING WORLD 


[Captioner] 20:59:44
IS AN EXTENSION OF YOUR STAFF IN 
SACRAMENTO.


[Captioner] 20:59:46
THAT'S THE WAY WE APPROACH 
THINGS.


[Captioner] 20:59:49
WE FOCUS ON BUILDING PROACTIVE 
RELATIONSHIPS WITH

[Captioner] 20:59:53
 YOUR STATE 
LEGISLATORS, THEIR SENIOR STAFF,

[Captioner] 20:59:55
 
THE GOVERNOR'S ADMINISTRATION 


[Captioner] 20:59:58
AND THE KEY POLICY COMMITTEES..
AND A REALLY IMPORTANT

[Captioner] 21:00:00
 THING IN 
MY PROFESSIONAL OPINION IS 


[Captioner] 21:00:03
FOCUSING EFFORTS ON A RELATIVELY 
SMALLER AMOUNT OF BILLS, IN 


[Captioner] 21:00:07
ORDER TO MAXIMIZE OUR IMPACT.
THAT IS SOMETHING WE HAVE

[Captioner] 21:00:10
 DONE 
REALLY, REALLY WELL, IN THE FEW

[Captioner] 21:00:11
 
YEARS I'VE HAD THE PLEASURE OF 


[Captioner] 21:00:13
WORKING WITH THE CITY OF 
FREMONT.


[Captioner] 21:00:16
IS FOCUSING IN ON WHAT IS MOST 
IMPORTANT, WHERE

[Captioner] 21:00:19
 WE KNOW WE HAVE 
LEVERAGE AND HONING IN AND 


[Captioner] 21:00:22
REALLY BECOMING THOUGHT PARTNERS 
WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND THE

[Captioner] 21:00:23
 
ADMINISTRATION.


[Captioner] 21:00:26
SO IN DOING SO WE'VE HAD A 
NUMBER OF

[Captioner] 21:00:29
 SUCCESSES IN ACTUALLY 
AMENDING A LOT OF PIECES OF

[Captioner] 21:00:30
 
IMPORTANT LEGISLATION IN ORDER 


[Captioner] 21:00:34
TO MAKE THEM NOR FAVORABLE FOR 
THE CITY, WE'VE

[Captioner] 21:00:36
 DEVELOPED GOOD 
WORKING RELATIONSHIPS WITH 


[Captioner] 21:00:40
AUTHORS AND THEIR STAFFS, THEY 
TRUST US BECAUSE THEY KNOW WE'RE

[Captioner] 21:00:43
 
GOOD PARTNERS, WE OFFER 


[Captioner] 21:00:47
THOUGHTFUL SUGGESTIONS, COMING 
FROM -- AND REALLY CREDIT

[Captioner] 21:00:48
 TO THE 
CITY MANAGER, CITY MANAGER'S 


[Captioner] 21:00:52
OFFICE AND CITY

[Captioner] 21:00:56
 DEPARTMENT HEADS 
AND THEIR STAFF THEY BRING

[Captioner] 21:00:59
 THAT 
EXPERTISE AND KNOWLEDGE TO BE 


[Captioner] 21:01:02
SUCCESSFUL.
IN DOING THAT THAT BENEFITS OUR 


[Captioner] 21:01:05
BUDGET ADVOCACY.
WHEN WE HELP OUT A SENATOR OR A 


[Captioner] 21:01:08
ASSEMBLY MEMBER ON A PIECE OF 
LEGISLATION OR THOUGHTFUL 


[Captioner] 21:01:11
PROVIDE GOOD FEEDBACK OFTEN 
TIMES THAT IS AN

[Captioner] 21:01:13
 INCENTIVE FOR 
THEM TO WORK WITH US WHEN WE 


[Captioner] 21:01:17
WITH HAVE ASKS.
WHEN WE COME TO THE TABLE AND 


[Captioner] 21:01:19
ARE NEEDING SOMETHING THEY ARE 
MORE HELPFUL FOR US.


[Captioner] 21:01:22
WE ARE SWFL THAT.
CONSTANT IN

[Captioner] 21:01:25
-PERSON PRESENCE IN 
THE CAPITAL.


[Captioner] 21:01:29
WHAT I'VE PRIDED MY CIVIL ON

[Captioner] 21:01:32
 IS 
THAT SHOE LEATHER

[Captioner] 21:01:34
 ADVOCACY.
TALKING TO FOLKS, EAR ON THE 


[Captioner] 21:01:37
FLOOR, FIND OUT WHAT'S REALLY 
HAPPENING AND THAT'S KIND OF 


[Captioner] 21:01:40
THAT BENEFIT IN THAT, YOU KNOW, 
REALLY PERSONIFICATION

[Captioner] 21:01:44
 OF WE'RE 
AN EXTENSION OF CITY STAFF IN 


[Captioner] 21:01:47
SACRAMENTO BECAUSE WE'RE THERE 
FIGURING OUT WHAT

[Captioner] 21:01:50
 ACTUALLY HAS 
LEGS, WHAT IS SOMETHING WE DON'T 


[Captioner] 21:01:53
NEED TO WORRY ABOUT, WHAT WE DO 
NEED TO WORRY ABOUT AND

[Captioner] 21:01:54
 AT THE 
END OF THE DAY, LETTING DECISION 


[Captioner] 21:01:58
MAKERS IN SACRAMENTO KNOW HOW 
GREAT FREMONT IS.

[Captioner] 21:02:00

ONE OF THE THINGS WE LIKE TO DO 


[Captioner] 21:02:03
IS SHOWCASE YOUR GUYS WORK 
AROUND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT

[Captioner] 21:02:06
, 
SUSTAINABILITY NETWORK, YOUR 


[Captioner] 21:02:09
COMMITMENT TO SOCIAL SERVICES, 
GOOD WORK ON HOUSING ET CETERA, 


[Captioner] 21:02:12
THOSE ARE ALL THINGS THAT THE 
LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS TEAM, THE

[Captioner] 21:02:14
 
CITY MANAGER THEIR TEAM PROVIDES 


[Captioner] 21:02:18
ME, YOU KNOW, UPDATES, 
INFORMATION, NEWS ARTICLES AND I

[Captioner] 21:02:20
 
SHARE THOSE THEN WITH YOUR 


[Captioner] 21:02:23
LEGISLATOR, SO PEOPLE KNOW THE 
GOOD WORK THAT FREMONT'S DOING

[Captioner] 21:02:24
.
NEXT SLIDE.


[Captioner] 21:02:27
AND LASTLY JUST A COUPLE OF 
LEGISLATIVE

[Captioner] 21:02:29
 EFFORTS WE'VE WORKED 
ON RECENTLY.


[Captioner] 21:02:32
JUST TO GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT 
WE DO ON THE LEGISLATIVE

[Captioner] 21:02:36
 SPHERE, 
ASSEMBLY BILL 413, THE

[Captioner] 21:02:39
 DAY 
LIGHTING BILL BY YOUR

[Captioner] 21:02:41
 ASSEMBLY 
MEMBER ALEX LEE, PROHIBITS 


[Captioner] 21:02:45
VEHICLES TO BE STOPPED OR 
PARKING WITHIN 20

[Captioner] 21:02:46
 FEET OF A 
CROSSWALK.


[Captioner] 21:02:49
IT ALIGNS WITH COUNCIL 
PRIORITIES, VISION ZERO PLAN

[Captioner] 21:02:51
 
THAT FREMONT HAS IMPLEMENTED AND 


[Captioner] 21:02:54
BEEN A LEADER NATIONWIDE ON.
WE WERE ACTUALLY ASKED BY

[Captioner] 21:02:57
 THE 
AUTHOR AS PRIMARY WITNESS IN THE 


[Captioner] 21:02:59
SENATE TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE 
ON THAT BILL.


[Captioner] 21:03:02
WE DID SO.
I WAS THERE ON BEHALF OF

[Captioner] 21:03:03
 THE 
CITY OF FREMONT, WE SUPPORTED 


[Captioner] 21:03:06
THE BILL AND IT IS IN THE SENATE 
UP FOR A HEARING I BELIEVE ON 


[Captioner] 21:03:09
THE 27th OF THIS MONTH AND 
SENATE TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE 


[Captioner] 21:03:11
AND THIS IS SOMETHING WE'RE 
CONTINUING TO PUSH FORWARD ON 


[Captioner] 21:03:15
AND ONCE AGAIN IT ALIGNS WITH 
THE VISION ZERO PLAN.

[Captioner] 21:03:18

LAST SESSION, SENATE BILL 379 BY

[Captioner] 21:03:21
 
SENATOR WIENER WHICH

[Captioner] 21:03:25
 REQUIRED 
STREAMLINED AND

[Captioner] 21:03:33
 AUTOMATED 
PROVISIONING,

[Captioner] 21:03:36
 WHAT WE DID IS WE 
ACTED PROACTIVELY WITH THE 


[Captioner] 21:03:39
AUTHOR AND CITY STAFF TO DRAFT 
NEW SUBSTANTIVE LANGUAGE,

[Captioner] 21:03:42
 SECURE 
AMENDMENTS IN THAT BILL AND 


[Captioner] 21:03:45
EFFECTIVELY AVOID ANY SORT OF 
POTENTIAL LIABILITY ON 


[Captioner] 21:03:48
STATISTICIAN FOR USING 
STREAMLINED OR

[Captioner] 21:03:50
 AUTOMATED 
PERMITTING FOR SOLAR STATEMENTS.


[Captioner] 21:03:53
SO WE WERE ABLE TO GO FROM AN

[Captioner] 21:03:55
 
OPPOSED POSITION TO A NEUTRAL 


[Captioner] 21:03:58
POKS ON THE BILL.
WE WERE ABLE TO EXCHANGE I.T.


[Captioner] 21:04:00
BEING THOUGHT PARTNERS WITH THE 
LEGISLATURE AND THEIR STAFF IS 


[Captioner] 21:04:03
KEY AND DOING SO WE ORGANICALLY 
DEVELOPMENT TRUST

[Captioner] 21:04:06
ING AND WORKING 
RELATIONSHIPS.


[Captioner] 21:04:09
I'LL TRANSFER IT TO MS. G AIO TO 
FINISH OFF

[Captioner] 21:04:10
.
>> GOOD EVENING MAYOR AND 


[Captioner] 21:04:13
MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL.
SO JUST REALLY

[Captioner] 21:04:16
 PIGGYBACKING ON 
WHAT DRAN

[Captioner] 21:04:20
 DAYS MENTIONED, WE 
TOOK POSITION ON 11

[Captioner] 21:04:23
 BILLS LAST 
SESSION, SHOWING YOU WE ARE 


[Captioner] 21:04:26
STRATEGIC ON WHAT WE ARE PUTTING 
FORWARD AS PRIORITIES OF THE 


[Captioner] 21:04:28
CITY.
JUST AN ANALYSIS OF THAT, EIGHT 


[Captioner] 21:04:32
WERE IN SUPPORT, TWO WERE 
NEUTRAL AND

[Captioner] 21:04:34
 ONE WAS OPPOSING.
NEXT SLIDE.


[Captioner] 21:04:37
WITH OUR ABILITY TO REALLY BUILD  
PARTNERSHIPS

[Captioner] 21:04:40
 WITH OUR 
REPRESENTS, WE

[Captioner] 21:04:44
 REPRESENTATIVES, WE 
WERE SSMED AND WATER

[Captioner] 21:04:47
ED $21 
MILLION OF CITY

[Captioner] 21:04:50
 PROJECTS.
YOU WERE AWARE OF CHECK SIGNING

[Captioner] 21:04:53
 
BUT THESE REALLY

[Captioner] 21:04:56
 SPAN CITY 
INITIATIVES

[Captioner] 21:04:59
, SABERCAT TRAIL 
EXTENSION, BEING

[Captioner] 21:05:03
 AWARDED $12th 
MILLION, CENTRAL PARK

[Captioner] 21:05:05
 MULTIUSE 
CENTER AND OF COURSE OUR HOUSING 


[Captioner] 21:05:09
NAVIGATION CENTER AND AT THE 
FEDERAL LEVEL

[Captioner] 21:05:12
, IMPLEMENTING A 
NEW PROGRAM, WHICH

[Captioner] 21:05:16
 IS DEPLOYING 
WII 70 IN

[Captioner] 21:05:18
 OUR EXRECIAL BUSINESS 
DISTRICTS.


[Captioner] 21:05:21
AND ALLOWING YOU TO KNOW NEXT 
YEAR, OR IN THIS PROCESS THIS

[Captioner] 21:05:24
 
YEAR, WE WERE SELECTIONS FOR

[Captioner] 21:05:27
 TEN 
MILLION IN MORE PRIORITY 


[Captioner] 21:05:30
PROJECTS FOR THE CITY INCLUDING 
THE CENTRAL PARK MULTI

[Captioner] 21:05:33
ANY CENTER 
AS WELL

[Captioner] 21:05:36
 AS THE POLICE COMMUNITY 
CENTER CAMERAS

[Captioner] 21:05:39
.
SO JUST WANTED YOU TO KNOW WE 


[Captioner] 21:05:42
ARE TRACKING THE SUCCESS OF THAT 
PROCESS.


[Captioner] 21:05:45
NEXT SLIDE PLEASE.
SO BEFORE YOU TONIGHT WE

[Captioner] 21:05:49
 ARE 
HOPING THAT YOU WILL ADOPT OUR

[Captioner] 21:05:50
 
LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORK WHICH 


[Captioner] 21:05:53
REALLY CONSISTS OF THESE FOUR 
CATEGORIES.


[Captioner] 21:05:56
THE FRAMEWORK EXPLAINS REALLY 
THE LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS

[Captioner] 21:05:57
 PROGRAMS 
ADMINISTRATION AS WELL AS OUR 


[Captioner] 21:06:00
WORK PLAN HOW WE CONDUCT OUR 
PROCESS.


[Captioner] 21:06:03
IT'S REALLY ROOTED IN

[Captioner] 21:06:05
 YOUR CITY 
COUNCIL PRIORITIES WHICH YOU 


[Captioner] 21:06:08
ADOPT EVERY YEAR SO WE WANT TO 
MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE BEING

[Captioner] 21:06:10
 
STRATEGIC AND REALLY PUSHING FOR 


[Captioner] 21:06:14
BILLS IN THOSE AREAS.
AS WELL AS IT'S ROOTED IN 


[Captioner] 21:06:16
EXISTING PLANS AND POLICIES THAT 
YOU ADOPT.


[Captioner] 21:06:19
SO THESE ARE THINGS LIKE THE 
CLIMATE ACTION PLAN, THE

[Captioner] 21:06:23
 CITY'S 
GENERAL PLAN, REALLY THINGS THAT 


[Captioner] 21:06:25
YOU -- ARE FORMALLY ADOPTED BY 
YOU ALL.


[Captioner] 21:06:29
AND THEN GOING FORWARD, THE 
FRAMEWORK ALSO

[Captioner] 21:06:31
 EXPLAINS, 
ESTABLISHED LEGISLATIVE ADVOCACY 


[Captioner] 21:06:35
POSITIONS WHICH GO MORE INTO THE 
SUBJECT MATTER AREA.


[Captioner] 21:06:38
SO SUCH AS KEEPING FREMONT SAFE, 
THE QUALITY OF LIFE, THESE

[Captioner] 21:06:40
 ARE 
OUR STATEMENTS THAT REALLY SAY 


[Captioner] 21:06:43
WHAT THE CITY SUPPORTS AND 
OPPOSES, IN

[Captioner] 21:06:45
 PARTICULAR 
LEGISLATION.


[Captioner] 21:06:49
NEXT SLIDE PLEASE.
SO ADDITIONALLY

[Captioner] 21:06:52
, BESIDES THE 
FRAMEWORK WE'RE HOPING THAT YOU

[Captioner] 21:06:55
 
WILL ALLOW OR APPROVE TO HAVE A 


[Captioner] 21:06:59
LETTER OF SUPPORT TRANSMITTED BY 
MAYOR MEI IN SUPPORT

[Captioner] 21:07:02
 OF AB 1657 
WHICH IS THE

[Captioner] 21:07:05
 AFFORDABLE HOUSING 
BOND ACT OF 2024.


[Captioner] 21:07:08
AND REALLY, IF THIS BILL IS 
PASSED

[Captioner] 21:07:11
 AND APPROVED IT WILL 
PLACE A $10 BILLION BOND MEASURE

[Captioner] 21:07:14
 
ON THE MARCH 2024 BALLOT

[Captioner] 21:07:17
 TO 
CONTINUE TO SPUR THE PRODUCTION 


[Captioner] 21:07:21
OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND REALLY 
LOOKING TO

[Captioner] 21:07:25
 SUPPORT SUPPORTIVE 
HOUSING PROGRAMS ACROSS THE 


[Captioner] 21:07:28
STATE WHICH WILL, YOU KNOW, HELP 
FREMONT

[Captioner] 21:07:32
 ALSO TO FURTHER ITS 
LEGISLATIVE ADVOCACY POSITION

[Captioner] 21:07:34
 OF 
SPURRING OF THE PRODUCTION OF 


[Captioner] 21:07:37
AFFORDABLE HOUSING BUT ALSO 
PROVIDING SERVICES TO OUR 


[Captioner] 21:07:40
HOMELESSNESS POPULATION.
SO THIS

[Captioner] 21:07:44
 SLIDE GIVES SOME OF THE 
PROVISIONS OF THE BOND

[Captioner] 21:07:47
.
IT'S SPECIFIC PROGRAMS IN WHICH

[Captioner] 21:07:49
 
IT WILL PROVIDE FUNDING TO BUT 


[Captioner] 21:07:52
WE ALSO WANT TO HIGHLIGHT AS 
MANY OF

[Captioner] 21:07:56
 OUR ALLEVIATE ADVOCACY 
POSITIONS,

[Captioner] 21:08:01
 -- LEGISLATIVE 
ADVOCACY POSITION HE THAT WE

[Captioner] 21:08:03
 
DEVELOP IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE 


[Captioner] 21:08:05
CALIFORNIA LEAGUE OF CITIES THIS 
MEASURE WAS ALSO SUPPORTED BY 


[Captioner] 21:08:08
THAT, WAS BROUGHT TO THE CITY 
THAT WAY AND THEN WAS ALSO 


[Captioner] 21:08:11
SUPPORTED BY OUR DEPARTMENT.
SO JUST WANTED TO 

[Captioner] 21:08:14
KIND OF SHOW 
YOU HOW THE PROGRAM WORKS IN 


[Captioner] 21:08:17
ACTION.
IT IS USUALLY BROUGHT FORWARD BY 


[Captioner] 21:08:20
OUR PARTNERSHIP ORGANIZATIONS OR 
OR CITY DEPARTMENTS.


[Captioner] 21:08:23
IT IS REVIEWED BY OUR OFFICE AND 
THEN

[Captioner] 21:08:27
 LOOKED AGAINST OUR 
FRAMEWORK AND THEN WE MAKE

[Captioner] 21:08:28
 A 
DECISION ON WHAT POSITION WE 


[Captioner] 21:08:31
WILL TAKE.
SO I THINK --

[Captioner] 21:08:35
 NEXT SLIDE JUST 
REITERATES THE RECOMMENDATION

[Captioner] 21:08:36
 OF 
THE STAFF REPORT TONIGHT.


[Captioner] 21:08:39
SO I THINK WE'RE AVAILABLE FOR 
ANY QUESTION

[Captioner] 21:08:43
 AS WELL AS THE 
ACTUAL BILL.


[Captioner] 21:08:46
THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU FOR

[Captioner] 21:08:47
 
THE PRESENTATION.


[Captioner] 21:08:50

TURN THIS BACK TO

[Captioner] 21:08:52
 OUR 
COUNCILMEMBERS TO SEE IF THERE 


[Captioner] 21:08:55
IS ANY QUESTIONS ON THE 
PRESENTATION FOR THIS EVENING.

[Captioner] 21:08:58

VICE MAYOR COX.

[Captioner] 21:08:59

>> Vice Mayor Cox:   THANK YOU

[Captioner] 21:09:07
 
BETTER AND BETTER.


[Captioner] 21:09:10
AND OUR FRAMEWORK AND WORKING 
PLAN.


[Captioner] 21:09:13
ONE OF THE QUESTIONS I HAD WAS 
WEIGHING

[Captioner] 21:09:16
 IN ON SOME OF THE LABOR 
OR TRADE

[Captioner] 21:09:19
 ORGANIZATIONS.
I DIDN'T SEE IT

[Captioner] 21:09:21
 NECESSARILY 
JUMPING OUT AT ME.


[Captioner] 21:09:24
BUT MAYBE IT IS EMBEDDED IN SOME

[Captioner] 21:09:27
 
OF THE COLLABORATION EFFORTS TO 


[Captioner] 21:09:30
INCLUDE THEIR INPUT AS WELL, OR 
PARTNERING AND SEEING IF

[Captioner] 21:09:34
 THERE'S 
SOME ITEMS THAT WE CAN PARTNER

[Captioner] 21:09:37
 
TOGETHER AND CERTAINLY, YOU 


[Captioner] 21:09:41
KNOW, DO SOME OF THE THINGS THAT 
ARE DEFINITELY IN THIS UP

[Captioner] 21:09:44
COMING 
BILL FOR AB 1657 I THINK IT

[Captioner] 21:09:47
 WAS, 
THAT, YOU KNOW, IT ENCOME FAST

[Captioner] 21:09:50
S 
OTHER AREAS THAT WILL BE SOME

[Captioner] 21:09:53
 
OTHER TRADE ORGANIZATIONS

[Captioner] 21:09:56
 THAT 
THE FARM WORKERS 

[Captioner] 21:09:59
YOIB THAT WOULD 
BE IN SUPPORT OF THAT.


[Captioner] 21:10:01
-- UNION THAT WOULD BE SUPPORTED 
IN THAT.


[Captioner] 21:10:04
I DIDN'T SEE THAT NECESSARILY IN 
THE PRESENTATION THAT YOU HAD

[Captioner] 21:10:07
 
SOUGHT OUT THEIR SUPPORT WITH

[Captioner] 21:10:11
 
DOLORES HUERT

[Captioner] 21:10:14
A AS ONE OF THE 
LIVING MEMBERS OF THE FARM

[Captioner] 21:10:16
 
WORKERS UNION.


[Captioner] 21:10:19
I JUST WANTED TO SEE IF THERE 
ARE SOME NEWS OR OPPORTUNITIES 


[Captioner] 21:10:22
THAT WE CAN INCLUDE THAT VOICE 
AS PART OF THOSE ORGANIZATION HE

[Captioner] 21:10:25
 
TO BE ABLE TO REACH OUT TO

[Captioner] 21:10:27
.
 .


[Captioner] 21:10:30
>> SURE, WITH REGARDS TO AB 16

[Captioner] 21:10:34
57 
FESTIVAL, THERE IS

[Captioner] 21:10:37
 A LINK IN THE 
STAFF REPORT THAT WILL TAKE YOU 


[Captioner] 21:10:41
THOUGHT LEGISLATIVE BILL ITSELF.
AT THE END OF THE BILL THERE IS 


[Captioner] 21:10:44
A FACT SHEET AND IT WILL INCLUDE 
A LIST OF SEVERAL OF THE-O

[Captioner] 21:10:47
S THAT 
HAVE SIGNED ON TO THIS PIECE OF 


[Captioner] 21:10:50
LEGISLATION.
SO THERE'S ABOUT A DOZEN

[Captioner] 21:10:53
 HABITAT 
FOR HUMANITY, LEAGUE OF

[Captioner] 21:10:56
 
CALIFORNIA CITY, AND WE 


[Captioner] 21:11:00
ALWAYS -- ANY ORGANIZATION THAT 
BRINGS FORTH A

[Captioner] 21:11:03
 BILL TO US OR 
ASKS US TO CONSIDER

[Captioner] 21:11:06
 SUPPORT, WE 
DO TAKE A LOOK AT THOSE ON

[Captioner] 21:11:09
 A 
REGULAR BASIS.

[Captioner] 21:11:12

AT THIS POINT IN TIME, REALLY 


[Captioner] 21:11:15
THE ASK IS SIMPLY TO TRANSMIT A 
LETTER TO THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER

[Captioner] 21:11:17
 
FOR SUPPORT OF THIS PIECE OF 


[Captioner] 21:11:20
LEGISLATION, THAT IF PASSED 
WOULD THEN PLACE A

[Captioner] 21:11:22
 POTENTIAL 
BOND MEASURE ON THE BALLOT.


[Captioner] 21:11:25
IF THAT SHOULD HAPPEN, WE WOULD 
COME BACK TO COUNCIL

[Captioner] 21:11:29
 FOR YOUR 
APPROVAL TO SIGN ON TO THAT

[Captioner] 21:11:29
 
BALLOT MEASURE.


[Captioner] 21:11:32
BUT WE WOULD PROBABLY DO, 
ANALYSIS FIRST

[Captioner] 21:11:36
, ENSURE THAT 
THERE IS NO COMPETING BALLOT

[Captioner] 21:11:38
 
MEASURES.


[Captioner] 21:11:41
THERE IS SOME CONVERSATIONS THAT 
THERE COULD BE SOME OTHER

[Captioner] 21:11:43
 
AFFORDABLE HOUSING BOND MEASURES 


[Captioner] 21:11:47
INTRODUCED.
SO PRIOR TO COMING -- YOU KNOW 


[Captioner] 21:11:50
WE WOULD DO THAT ANALYSIS PRIOR 
TO COMING BACK TO COUNCIL AND 


[Captioner] 21:11:54
ASK YOU AT THAT POINT IN TIME IF 
YOU WOULD LIKE TO TAKE ANNAL

[Captioner] 21:11:56
 
OFFICIAL POSITION ON THAT BALLOT 


[Captioner] 21:11:59
MEASURE IN SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION 
OR WHATEVER THAT MIGHT BE STAT.


[Captioner] 21:12:04
>> Vice Mayor Cox:   THAT WOULD 
BE GREAT.


[Captioner] 21:12:07
YOU KNOW, BECAUSE THAT'S KIND OF 
LIKE YOUR STANDARD PROCESS

[Captioner] 21:12:08
 YOU 
HAVE BEEN FULFILLING FOR THE 


[Captioner] 21:12:12
LAST I CAN'T REMEMBER NOW.
BUT MORE THAN A YEAR

[Captioner] 21:12:15
.
AND I APPRECIATE THAT PART.


[Captioner] 21:12:18
IT

[Captioner] 21:12:21
 WAS JUST MAKING SURE IN YOUR 
LISTING OF COLLABORATION

[Captioner] 21:12:23
 THAT 
YOU HAD ALSO LISTED LABOR AND 


[Captioner] 21:12:26
TRADE ORGANIZATIONS AS ANOTHER 
GROUP

[Captioner] 21:12:29
 THAT MAY BE UNIQUE TO HAVE 
CALLED OUT

[Captioner] 21:12:33
 AS COLLABORATIONS, OR 
INCLUDING

[Captioner] 21:12:37
 WHATEVER THE ADVOCACY, 
BUT INCLUDING

[Captioner] 21:12:40
 THOSE TYPE OF 
GROUPS THAT WE WOULD SEEK INPUT 


[Captioner] 21:12:43
JUST TO SEE WHERE THEY STAND ON 
PARTICULAR ISSUES.

[Captioner] 21:12:45

THAT'S ALL I WAS JUST SAYING, 


[Captioner] 21:12:48
AND IT JUST KIND OF ROLLED IN 
TOGETHER WITH ONE OF THE ACTION

[Captioner] 21:12:50
 
ITEMS.


[Captioner] 21:12:53
ONE OF THE OTHER PARTS IS,

[Captioner] 21:12:57
 IS 
THERE ANY AVENUE OF THE

[Captioner] 21:12:59
 
COMMUNITY EVER SENDING 


[Captioner] 21:13:02
INFORMATION ON CERTAIN BILLS 
OUTSIDE OF JUST OUR REGULAR CITY

[Captioner] 21:13:04
 
CLERK'S OFFICES TO RECEIVE 


[Captioner] 21:13:09
FEEDBACK FROM THE COMMUNITY?
AND

[Captioner] 21:13:12
 HOW DOES THAT WORK OR COULD 
YOU SHARE A

[Captioner] 21:13:15
 LITTLE BIT MORE ON 
THAT ASPECT OF IT?


[Captioner] 21:13:18
>> WE DON'T GET AS MANY 
REFERRALS THE LOOK AT BUILTS

[Captioner] 21:13:20
 
FROM THE COMMUNITY AS YOU -- BUT 


[Captioner] 21:13:23
OCCASIONALLY WE DO HAVE A 
COMMUNITY -- USUALLY COMES

[Captioner] 21:13:25
 FROM 
NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS, 


[Captioner] 21:13:28
COMMUNITY GROUPS THAT ARE 
SUPPORTING A BILL AND THEY'LL 


[Captioner] 21:13:31
ASK THE CITY FOR EXAMPLE TO SIGN 
ON OR CONSIDER SIGNING

[Captioner] 21:13:34
 ON.
AND, YOU KNOW, IF IT FALLS 


[Captioner] 21:13:37
WITHIN OUR FRAMEWORK, IF IT'S 
SOMETHING THAT 

[Captioner] 21:13:40
WE FEEL, YOU 
KNOW, THE CITY SHOULD SUPPORT WE 


[Captioner] 21:13:43
ALSO TAKE, YOU KNOW, ONE THING 
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT EARLIER 


[Captioner] 21:13:46
TODAY IS THAT WE ALSO TAKE A 
LOOK AT THE

[Captioner] 21:13:49
 BILLS AND HOW 
THEY'RE PROGRESSING THROUGH

[Captioner] 21:13:50
 
DIFFERENT COMMITTEES.


[Captioner] 21:13:53
AND RIGHT NOW, SEVERAL OF THE 
BILLS THAT WE'RE WATCHING

[Captioner] 21:13:57
 HAVE 
HAD THE MAJORITY SUPPORT

[Captioner] 21:13:58
 ALMOST 
UNANIMOUS SUPPORT.


[Captioner] 21:14:01
AND SO WHAT WE TRY TO DO IS 
FOCUS ON THE BILLS,

[Captioner] 21:14:03
 WHERE WE 
MIGHT HAVE A BIGGER IMPACT, 


[Captioner] 21:14:06
WHERE WE MIGHT NEED SOME 
LEGISLATIVE AMENDMENTS, WHERE 


[Captioner] 21:14:10
THAT BILL'S JUST NOT QUITE, YOU 
KNOW, 100%

[Captioner] 21:14:13
 TO WORK YOU KNOW AND 
ALIGN

[Captioner] 21:14:15
 WITH THE CITY WITH OUR 
OPERATIONS OR SERVICES.


[Captioner] 21:14:18
SO WE TRY

[Captioner] 21:14:21
 FOCUS ON THOSE BECAUSE 
WE KNOW THESE OTHER BILLS ARE 


[Captioner] 21:14:23
GOING TO MOVE FORWARD ON THEIR 
OWN.


[Captioner] 21:14:26
WE'RE ALWAYS IF A COMMUNITY 
GROUP OR ORGANIZATION OR 


[Captioner] 21:14:29
INDIVIDUAL SENDS A BUILT TO US 
THROUGH OUR

[Captioner] 21:14:37
 LEGISLATIVE

[Captioner] 21:14:40
 AFFAIRS 
PROGRAM, WE WILL AT LEAST HAVE A 


[Captioner] 21:14:42
CONVERSATION WITH THEM.
>> Vice Mayor Cox:   IS THERE 


[Captioner] 21:14:45
SOMETHING ON OUR QUICK LINK, OR 
IS IT GOING THROUGH

[Captioner] 21:14:48
 OUR NORMAL 
CITY CLERK'S OFFICE THAT WOULD 


[Captioner] 21:14:51
BE THE ONES COLLECTORROR OF OUR

[Captioner] 21:14:56
 
INFORMAL

[Captioner] 21:14:59
 CORRESPONDENCE?
>> WE TRY TO KEEP TRACK OF 


[Captioner] 21:15:03
 ALL 
OF THAT ON

[Captioner] 21:15:07
 OUR INFORMATION, WE 
TRY TO KEEP TRACK ON

[Captioner] 21:15:10
 OUR FREMONT 
NEWSLETTER, SHARING THAT

[Captioner] 21:15:12
 AS 
WELL, AND YOU'RE WELCOME TO 


[Captioner] 21:15:15
SHARE THAT WITH YOUR 
CONSTITUENTS AS WELL

[Captioner] 21:15:16
 IF YOU WANT 
TO.


[Captioner] 21:15:19
>> Vice Mayor Cox:   THERE ARE 
NUMEROUS WAYS TO BE COMMUNICATED 


[Captioner] 21:15:22
BASICALLY JUST KIND OF TO MAKE 
SURE WE PUT THAT AS

[Captioner] 21:15:25
 PART OF 
MAKING THAT CLEAR ON OUR WORK 


[Captioner] 21:15:28
 
PLAN OF SOME OF OUR OTHER

[Captioner] 21:15:30
, 
ALLOWING THE COMMUNITY TO BE 


[Captioner] 21:15:33
ABLE TO SHARE THEIR THOUGHTS AND

[Captioner] 21:15:36
 
VOICE WHETHER IN SUPPORT OR IN 


[Captioner] 21:15:39
OPPOSITION OF PARTICULAR

[Captioner] 21:15:40
 
LEGISLATIVE MATTERS.


[Captioner] 21:15:44
BUT I JUST WANTED TO DOUBLE 
CHECK ON THAT

[Captioner] 21:15:45
.
>> ABSOLUTELY.


[Captioner] 21:15:48
>> Vice Mayor Cox:   AND I'M 
READY TO MAKE A MOTION BUT I'LL 


[Captioner] 21:15:50
WAIT TO HOLD THAT.
>> Mayor Mei:   COUNCILMEMBER 


[Captioner] 21:15:54
KASSAN.
>> Councilmember Kassan:  

[Captioner] 21:15:55
 THANK 
YOU.


[Captioner] 21:15:59
SO I KNOW IN THE PAST I'VE HAD 
LITTLE NITPICKS WITH

[Captioner] 21:16:00
 THIS 
AGENDA.


[Captioner] 21:16:03
AND THIS TIME IT'S NOT AS 
SPECIFIC.

[Captioner] 21:16:04

SO I FOUND ABSOLUTELY NOTHING IN 


[Captioner] 21:16:08
IT TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT.
BUT I WAS KIND

[Captioner] 21:16:12
 OF WONDERING, YOU 
KNOW, WHAT WAS

[Captioner] 21:16:15
 THE CHANGE -- WHY 
DID IT CHANGE TO BE A LITTLE BIT 


[Captioner] 21:16:18
LESS SPECIFIC?
>> YOU KNOW, THIS YEAR WE

[Captioner] 21:16:20
 TOOK 
AN APPROACH OF TRYING TO CLEAN 


[Captioner] 21:16:23
IT UP.
I THINK THE DOCUMENT ITSELF

[Captioner] 21:16:26
 WAS 
GETTING LENGTHIER AND LENGTHIER 


[Captioner] 21:16:29
BECAUSE WE WERE TRYING TO BE 
MORE INCLUSIVE AND MAKE SURE 


[Captioner] 21:16:32
THAT EVERYTHING WAS INCLUDED.
AT THE END OF THE DAY, OUR WORK 


[Captioner] 21:16:35
IS REALLY TO 74th THE POLICY 
OF COUNCIL

[Captioner] 21:16:38
 AND YOUR PRIORITIES.
AND WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT OUR

[Captioner] 21:16:40
 
DOCUMENT IS SO TIGHT AND REFIND 


[Captioner] 21:16:43
THAT WE ENSURE THAT OUR WORK IS 
IN LINE WITH

[Captioner] 21:16:46
 WHAT YOU ALL 
INSTRUCT US TO DO AND FOLLOW.


[Captioner] 21:16:48
SO THAT IS REALLY WHERE THE 
CLEANUP.


[Captioner] 21:16:51
THERE WERE A LOT OF WORDS, AND 
WE COULD UNDERSTAND

[Captioner] 21:16:54
 YOU WEREN'T 
THE ONLY ONE THAT, YOU KNOW, WAS 


[Captioner] 21:16:57
FOCUSING IN ON SOME THINGS.
AND IN SOME

[Captioner] 21:17:01
 OF THOSE THINGS 
MIGHT ALSO BE POLITICAL,

[Captioner] 21:17:03
 WHERE 
NOT EVERYBODY IS IN AGREEMENT ON 


[Captioner] 21:17:06
ALL OF THOSE THINGS.
AND THAT IS NOT OUR ROLE AS A

[Captioner] 21:17:09
 
CITY TO -- YOU KNOW, WE

[Captioner] 21:17:11
 ARE 
APOLITICAL.


[Captioner] 21:17:14
WE ARE HERE TO SUPPORT THE  
CITY'S INITIATIVES AND

[Captioner] 21:17:17
 THE 
CITY'S ISSUES

[Captioner] 21:17:21
.
WE HAVE LIMITED

[Captioner] 21:17:26
 TO THE BEST MUCH 
OUR TIME AND OUR ENERGY AND OUR 


[Captioner] 21:17:29
EFFORTS.
>> Councilmember Kassan:   I 


[Captioner] 21:17:31
REALLY APPRECIATE THAT.
GREAT JOB.


[Captioner] 21:17:34
IT I WAS HAPPY TO SEE THAT

[Captioner] 21:17:36
 I 
COULD ENTHUSIASTICALLY SUPPORT 


[Captioner] 21:17:40
THIS VERSION, SO THANK YOU .


[Captioner] 21:17:44
>> Mayor Mei:   VICE MAYOR COX 
DO YOU HAVE ANOTHER COMMENT?


[Captioner] 21:17:47
OTHERWISE I HAVE SOME COMMENTS.
COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL

[Captioner] 21:17:48
 HAS SOME 
ALSO.


[Captioner] 21:17:52
>> Vice Mayor Cox:   I WAS GOING 
TO MAKE THE MOTION.


[Captioner] 21:17:54
>> Mayor Mei:   IF YOU WANT TO 
AMERICA THE MOTION TO ACCEPT AND 


[Captioner] 21:17:57
SOMEBODY WANT TO SECOND.
MOVED

[Captioner] 21:18:01
 BY VICE MAYOR COX AKD 
SECONDED

[Captioner] 21:18:03
 BY COUNCILMEMBER 
SALWAN.


[Captioner] 21:18:06
COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL.


[Captioner] 21:18:09
>> Councilmember Campbell:   I 
TOO AGREE WITH COUNCILMEMBER 


[Captioner] 21:18:13
KASSAN IT WAS VERY, VERY DIRECT, 
TO THE POINT.

[Captioner] 21:18:16

THIS LOOKS SPECIFICALLY AT THE 


[Captioner] 21:18:19
PRIORITIES THAT THE CITY COUNCIL 
HAS ADOPTED

[Captioner] 21:18:22
.
AND SO I'M IN FULL SUPPORT OF 


[Captioner] 21:18:24
THIS AS WELL.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 21:18:29
>> Mayor Mei:   I'M JUST GOING 
TO ADD MY GENERAL COMMENTS AS 


[Captioner] 21:18:31
WELL.
I'M SUPPORTIVE OF THIS.


[Captioner] 21:18:34
I THINK THERE IS OFTENTIMES THAT 
THERE HAVE

[Captioner] 21:18:37
 BEEN BILLS AND 
LEGISLATION THAT I

[Captioner] 21:18:40
 THINK ARE 
POLITICAL, I THINK

[Captioner] 21:18:43
 IT'S 
FORTUNATE THAT WE KEEP IT CLEAN, 


[Captioner] 21:18:48
AS WE UNDERSTAND THE PRIORITIES, 
UNDERSTAND THE FOCUS AND 


[Captioner] 21:18:51
CERTAINLY HAVE SHOWN THE SUCCESS 
IN GETTING THAT DONE IN TERMS OF 


[Captioner] 21:18:54
GETTING THE FUNDING AND SUPPORT 
AND THE PARTNERSHIP WITH 


[Captioner] 21:18:57
TOWNSEND, PUBLIC AFFAIRS, AS 
WELL AS WITH ALL OF OUR STAFF I 


[Captioner] 21:18:59
THINK HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN 
GETTING THAT DONE.


[Captioner] 21:19:02
AND WE HAVE A TIGHT TIME FRAME 
AND WE HAVE LOOT

[Captioner] 21:19:04
 OF PROJECTS TO 
STILL FINISH.


[Captioner] 21:19:07
SO I AM SUPPORTIVE OF THAT.
WITH THAT WE HAVE A MOTION AND 


[Captioner] 21:19:10
SECOND.
PLEASE VOTE.


[Captioner] 21:19:13
>> Alberto Quintanilla:   WE DO 
HAVE PUBLIC COMMENT.


[Captioner] 21:19:16
>> Mayor Mei:   SORRY

[Captioner] 21:19:18
 I 
APOLOGIZE.


[Captioner] 21:19:21
WE HAVE SPEAKERS?
>> Alberto Quintanilla: 

[Captioner] 21:19:24
  FIRST 
SPEAKER IS

[Captioner] 21:19:27
 LINDA de LANEY.


[Captioner] 21:19:32
>> Mayor Mei:   WELCOME LINDA.

[Captioner] 21:19:34

>> GOOD EVENING, MAYOR MEI, CITY 


[Captioner] 21:19:37
COUNCIL AND STAFF INCLUDING THE 
TERRIFIC DAN

[Captioner] 21:19:38
 SCHOENHOLZ OVER 
THERE.


[Captioner] 21:19:41
MY NAME IS LINDA de LAN

[Captioner] 21:19:43
EY AND 
I'M A MEMBER OF FREMONT FOR 


[Captioner] 21:19:46
EVERYONE.
I'M HERE THOUGH TONIGHT AS A 


[Captioner] 21:19:50
45th CITIZEN NOT REPRESENTING 
THE ORGANIZATION, ALTHOUGH WE

[Captioner] 21:19:53
 
DID GET BACK FROM LOBBY DAY, WE 


[Captioner] 21:19:57
WERE IN SACRAMENTO ALL DAY, THAT

[Captioner] 21:19:59
 
WAS REALLY, REALLY REALLY COOL, 


[Captioner] 21:20:02
I HAVEN'T DONE THAT BEFORE.
I WAS REALLY PREPARED TO TRY TO 


[Captioner] 21:20:05
CONVINCE YOU ALL TO SUPPORT 
THIS.

[Captioner] 21:20:09

THIS RECOMMENDATION FROM STAFF.


[Captioner] 21:20:12
AND I KIND OF

[Captioner] 21:20:16
 FEEL LIKE I DON'T 
NEED TO TWIST ANYBODY'S ARM NOW

[Captioner] 21:20:17
 
BUT I'M REALLY ENCOURAGED THAT 


[Captioner] 21:20:20
WE ARE LOOKING AT THIS FROM SUCH

[Captioner] 21:20:24
 
A DETAILED AND PRECISE

[Captioner] 21:20:27
 VANTAGE 
POINT.


[Captioner] 21:20:30
I REALLY WANT TO THANK MAYOR

[Captioner] 21:20:32
 MEI 
FOR PUTTING TOGETHER THE LETTER 


[Captioner] 21:20:37
TO SUPPORT THE

[Captioner] 21:20:41
 AFFORDABLE 
HOUSING ACT OF 2024 TO BE PUT ON 


[Captioner] 21:20:44
THE BALLOT, BECAUSE THAT'S ONE 
WAY THAT WE CAN

[Captioner] 21:20:47
 REALLY GET 
ACTION AND GET THINGS DONE

[Captioner] 21:20:49
.
SO I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT WE 


[Captioner] 21:20:52
TOOK THAT EXTRA STEP TO DO THAT.
AND I THINK

[Captioner] 21:20:57
 THAT BOND ITSELF AND 
WHAT IT CAN ACCOMPLISH

[Captioner] 21:20:59
 REALLY 
DOES SUPPORT WHAT FREMONT 


[Captioner] 21:21:03
TRIES -- HAS BEEN TRYING TO DO 
IN THE PAST

[Captioner] 21:21:06
 NUMBER OF YEARS, 
FIVE OR MORE YEARS TO ADDRESS

[Captioner] 21:21:08
 
THE ISSUES OF OUR UNHOUSED AND 


[Captioner] 21:21:13
HOUSING INSECURE RESIDENTS IN 
THE CITY.


[Captioner] 21:21:16
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, IT COULD 
HAPPEN TO ANY OF US

[Captioner] 21:21:19
.
WE COULD -- YOU COULD LOSE YOUR 


[Captioner] 21:21:22
HOUSE YOU COULD LOSE YOUR JOB 
YOU COULD LOSE YOUR HOUSE,

[Captioner] 21:21:25
 NONE 
OF US ARE IMMUNE FROM THAT.


[Captioner] 21:21:28
SO I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT YOU 
TAKE THIS ALL SO

[Captioner] 21:21:30
 SERIOUSLY.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR GIVING 


[Captioner] 21:21:32
ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK, 
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 21:21:39
>> Alberto Quintanilla:   OUR 
NEXT SPEAKER ON ZOOM

[Captioner] 21:21:42
 IS LISA DA

[Captioner] 21:21:45

DANS.


[Captioner] 21:21:47
>> GOOD EVENING, THANK YOU, 
LEASTIE DANS, FREMONT

[Captioner] 21:21:51
 RESIDENT.
I APPRECIATE YOU FOR SUPPORT

[Captioner] 21:21:55
ING 
ASSEMBLY NEB WICKS

[Captioner] 21:21:58
 BILL, FOR 
AFFORDABLE HOUSING,

[Captioner] 21:22:00
 SOUNDS LIKE 
EVERYBODY SUPPORTS IT, PLEASE DO 


[Captioner] 21:22:02
SUPPORT IT.
REGARDING THE REST OF THE 


[Captioner] 21:22:05
LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORK, I WOULD 
URGE YOU TO REMOVE

[Captioner] 21:22:08
 THE LANGUAGE 
AROUND ARE LOCAL CONTROL

[Captioner] 21:22:11
.
STREAMLINED AFFORDABLE HOUSING 


[Captioner] 21:22:14
IN COMMERCIAL CORRIDORS, I DON'T 
THINK I'VE SEEN ANY

[Captioner] 21:22:16
 PUBLIC 
STATEMENT BESIDES THE CITY'S 


[Captioner] 21:22:19
NAME ON THE OPPOSITION LIST BUT 
I CAN ONLY GUESS

[Captioner] 21:22:22
 THIS IS BASED 
ON THE LOCAL CONTROL FORMULA.


[Captioner] 21:22:27
WHAT WILL RESULT IN THE BEST 
OUTCOMES OVERALL.

[Captioner] 21:22:30

LOCAL CONTROL IS NOT A GOOD END 


[Captioner] 21:22:33
ITSELF, IT IS A MEANS IN ITSELF

[Captioner] 21:22:35
 
THAT CAN HELP IN SOME CASES AND 


[Captioner] 21:22:39
HURT IN SOME CASES.
I'M NOT GOING TO NAME NAMES BUT

[Captioner] 21:22:41
 
I THINK YOU CAN ALL THINK OF 


[Captioner] 21:22:44
SOME CITIES AND THEY DO LARGELY 
LEAN ON LOCAL CONTROL TO

[Captioner] 21:22:45
 BLOCK 
BUILDING HOUSING.


[Captioner] 21:22:49
AND THAT CONTRIBUTES TO THE 
HOUSING CRISIS THAT WE'RE ALL

[Captioner] 21:22:49
 
SUFFERING IN.


[Captioner] 21:22:52
IT'S SO LIKE IT REALLY IS A 
DOUBLE IMAGED

[Captioner] 21:22:55
 SWORD THAT ALLOWS 
OTHER CITIES TO BE BAD NEIGHBORS

[Captioner] 21:22:57
 
EVEN THOUGH FREMONT IS TRYING TO 


[Captioner] 21:23:00
BE A GOOD NEIGHBOR.
I'M NOT ASKING YOU TO TAKE

[Captioner] 21:23:02
 
ACTIVE POSITIONS OPPOSING LOCAL 


[Captioner] 21:23:06
CHROME, I BELIEVE THAT IS A 
BRIDGE TOO FAR BUT YOU

[Captioner] 21:23:09
 YOU CAN 
WITHDRAW YOUR OPPOSITION TO GOOD

[Captioner] 21:23:11
 
POLICIES THAT ARE JUST BASED ON 


[Captioner] 21:23:13
LOCAL CONTROL.
THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 21:23:23
>> HI, GOOD EVENING.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME

[Captioner] 21:23:26
.
I WOULD LIKE TO START OFF FIRST 


[Captioner] 21:23:30
BY SAYING I'M VERY PROUD OF

[Captioner] 21:23:33
 
FREMONT FOR ALL OF

[Captioner] 21:23:36
 THEIR 
PROACTIVE

[Captioner] 21:23:41
 DECISIONS AROUND 
PROVIDING

[Captioner] 21:23:45
 MORE HOUSING, AND 
WORKING ON HOMELESS ISSUES AND

[Captioner] 21:23:46
 
SUCH.


[Captioner] 21:23:49
SO THANK YOU.
I HAVE LIVED

[Captioner] 21:23:52
 IN THIS AREA FOR 
ABOUT 16 YEARS.


[Captioner] 21:23:54
IT'S MY HOME.
IN THIS TIME, I HAVE GONE FROM 


[Captioner] 21:23:58
WORKING IN A HIGHER INCOME 
BRACKET TO A

[Captioner] 21:24:01
 LOWER AND LOWER 
INCOME

[Captioner] 21:24:04
 BRACKET DUE TO AGE AND 
DISABILITIES

[Captioner] 21:24:07
.
WHEN OUR RENT WENT UP,

[Captioner] 21:24:10
 WE WERE 
FORCED TO MOVE BECAUSE WE COULD

[Captioner] 21:24:13
 
NOT SUPPORT THE INCREASED RENT.


[Captioner] 21:24:16
BECAUSE THERE WAS A LACK OF 
AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND SECTION 8 


[Captioner] 21:24:19
LISTS HAD BEEN CLOSED FOR YEARS 
AND WERE

[Captioner] 21:24:22
 PREDICTED TO BE  CLOSING

[Captioner] 21:24:26
 CLOSED 
FOR MANY MORE YEARS, IT CONTINUE

[Captioner] 21:24:29

CONTINUED THIS PATTERN WHERE WE 


[Captioner] 21:24:32
WERE NO LONGER ABLE TO AFFORD

[Captioner] 21:24:34
 
RENT ANYWHERE OR EVEN TO MOVE.


[Captioner] 21:24:37
OVER THE YEARS I'VE NOTICED MORE 
AND MORE

[Captioner] 21:24:41
 HOMENESS FOLKS.
WHICH FACTORED EVERY CITY

[Captioner] 21:24:42
 IN THE 
EAST BAY.


[Captioner] 21:24:45
WE TOO BECAME HOMELESS EVEN 
THOUGH WE WERE

[Captioner] 21:24:47
 BOTH EMPLOYED.
A COUPLE OF THINGS I UNDERSTAND 


[Captioner] 21:24:50
IS IT IS DIFFICULT TO BUILD 
AFFORDABLE HOUSING DUE TO A LACK 


[Captioner] 21:24:54
OF FUNDS AND CONTRACTORS SHYING 
AWAY FROM BUILDING PROJECTS

[Captioner] 21:24:56
 THAT 
WILL NOT BRING IN ENOUGH FROST 


[Captioner] 21:24:59
AND BANKS NOT EVEN WANTING TO 
SUPPORT LOANS

[Captioner] 21:25:02
 TO BUILD HOUSING 
THAT WILL ALSO NOT EARN ENOUGH

[Captioner] 21:25:03
 
PROFITS.


[Captioner] 21:25:06
ANY FUNDING WE CAN SUPPORT FOR 
MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING

[Captioner] 21:25:09
 IS 
ABSOLUTELY A MUST.


[Captioner] 21:25:12
PLEASE SUPPORT OUR HONORABLE 
MAYOR IN SENDING A

[Captioner] 21:25:15
 LETTER TO 
SUPPORT THE BILL 1657

[Captioner] 21:25:19
.
WE CANNOT KEEP IGNORING THIS

[Captioner] 21:25:21
 
NEED OR FREMONT WILL NO LONGER 


[Captioner] 21:25:25
BE THE HAPPIEST CITY AND WILL 
FACE MORE AND

[Captioner] 21:25:28
 MORE OVERWHELMING 
AND COMPLEX

[Captioner] 21:25:30
 PROBLEMS.

SINCE 2020.


[Captioner] 21:27:41
>> Mayor Mei:   THAT'S A LONG 
TERM COMMITMENT

[Captioner] 21:27:44

A STRONG SUPPORTER OF THAT.


[Captioner] 21:27:50
I WOULD LIKE TO THANK EVERYONE 
FOR YOUR SUPPORT.


[Captioner] 21:27:53
I REPRESENT

[Captioner] 21:27:55
ED US AT THE U.S. 
CONFERENCE OF MAYORS.


[Captioner] 21:27:59
WE DID FOCUS ON TRANSPORTATION 
AND HOUSING

[Captioner] 21:28:01
 AND HOMELESSNESS IN 
PARTICULAR FOCUSING THE SUPPORT 


[Captioner] 21:28:05
ON THAT, AND I BELIEVE SOMEBODY 
MENTIONED TO ME THEY

[Captioner] 21:28:07
 HEARD ABOUT 
IT ON CBS NEWS THIS MORNING THAT 


[Captioner] 21:28:11
WE TALKED ABOUT WHAT IS

[Captioner] 21:28:13
 ZERO -- 
TRUE HOUSING SUPPORT, AND I 


[Captioner] 21:28:17
THINK THAT HAVING THAT IS AN 
INCREDIBLE

[Captioner] 21:28:20
 THOUGHT JUST THE 
HOUSING PIECE OF IT, WHEN I HAD

[Captioner] 21:28:21
 
MAYOR BASS ALSO IN THIS 


[Captioner] 21:28:25
CONVERSATION, BUT IT'S NOT JUST 
HOUSING,

[Captioner] 21:28:28
 PHYSICAL STRUCTURE, 
IT'S ALL THE WRAP AROUND

[Captioner] 21:28:29
 
SERVICES THAT ARE REALLY 


[Captioner] 21:28:31
IMPORTANT FOR CONNECTING OUR 
COMMUNITY MEMBERS.


[Captioner] 21:28:34
SO THAT'S ONE PIECE.
AND THEN AS I MENTION

[Captioner] 21:28:37
ED EARLIER, 
MAYORS AGAINST ILLEGAL GUNS AND

[Captioner] 21:28:39
 
THE EFFORTS IN TERMS OF 


[Captioner] 21:28:42
AWARENESS FROM OUR RECOGNITION 
EARLIER THIS EVENING IS

[Captioner] 21:28:43
 
SOMETHING THAT WE'RE ALSO 


[Captioner] 21:28:46
FOCUSING ON.
BUT I ALSO APPRECIATE VERY MUCH 


[Captioner] 21:28:49
THE OPPORTUNITY WE HAD INITIATED

[Captioner] 21:28:51
 
THE ASIAN AMERICAN PACIFIC 


[Captioner] 21:28:55
ISLANDER ALLIANCE PREVIOUSLY AND 
APPROVED IT BUT WE HAD

[Captioner] 21:28:59
 OUR 
INAUGURAL MEETING AT THE 


[Captioner] 21:29:01
CONFERENCE.
I WAS THRILLED TO SEE THAT OUR 


[Captioner] 21:29:05
SPEAKER WAS ERICA MORTSUG

[Captioner] 21:29:06
A FROM 
THE WHITE HOUSE.


[Captioner] 21:29:08
SHE WAS ABLE TO COME AND JOIN 
US.


[Captioner] 21:29:11
IT IS NOT JUST FOR MEMBERS WHO 
ARE PERSONALLY AS MAYORS

[Captioner] 21:29:15
 ELECTED 
OF ASIAN AMERICAN-PACIFIC ISLAND

[Captioner] 21:29:17

ISLANDER OR NATIVE AMERICAN 


[Captioner] 21:29:21
HAWAIIAN HERITAGE, IT IS NOR 
THOSE CITIES THE NEED TO HAVE 


[Captioner] 21:29:23
THE ALLIES AT THIS MOMENT SO I 
REALLY APPRECIATE THAT.


[Captioner] 21:29:26
I KNOW THAT WHILE WE'RE THERE WE 
ALWAYS HAVE

[Captioner] 21:29:30
 THE OPPORTUNITY TO 
CELEBRATE AROUND ALSO JOIN

[Captioner] 21:29:33
 WITH 
THE LATINO MAYORS ALLIANCE AND 


[Captioner] 21:29:36
ALSO WITH THE BLACK MAYORS 
LOIRNZ AS WELL AS THE LGBTQ 


[Captioner] 21:29:39
WHICH I THINK IS VERY IMPORTANT.
BUT

[Captioner] 21:29:42
 AFTER 91 YEARS TO HAVE THIS 
OPPORTUNITY IT WAS VERY 


[Captioner] 21:29:45
HISTORIC.
AND SO VERY APPRECIATIVE OF THAT

[Captioner] 21:29:45

THAT.


[Captioner] 21:29:49
AND I THINK THAT'S ABOUT IT FOR 
CLOSE

[Captioner] 21:29:53
ING OUT.
AND I LOOK FORWARD TO,

[Captioner] 21:29:55
 IF YOU 
HAVEN'T HAD THE CHANCE, AND I 


[Captioner] 21:29:59
KNOW THAT I'M LOOKING FORWARD 
THIS THURSDAY

[Captioner] 21:30:01
 TO SHARING THE 
STATE OF THE CITY WHICH WILL BE 


[Captioner] 21:30:05
AT THE DOWNTOWN EVENT CENTER AND 
OR THE THOSE

[Captioner] 21:30:08
 WHO ARE NOT ABLE TO 
JOIN US

[Captioner] 21:30:11
 IT WILL ALSO BE RECORDED 
AND ALSO RELEASE BED A WEEK 


[Captioner] 21:30:14
LATER.
I ALSO WANTED

[Captioner] 21:30:17
 TO LET PEOPLE KNOW 
ABOUT THE FUTURE

[Captioner] 21:30:22
 OF FREMONT

[Captioner] 21:30:24
 
SILICON VALLEY BUSINESS JOURNAL 


[Captioner] 21:30:27
TO HIGHLIGHT OUR EFFORTS 
FESTIVAL

[Captioner] 21:30:29
 IN THE DOWNTOWN AREA AS 
WELL AS OUR LEADERSHIP 


[Captioner] 21:30:31
NATIONALLY FOR ADVANCED 
MANUFACTURING.


[Captioner] 21:30:34
SO WITH THAT I WANTED TO THANK 
EVERYONE FOR THEIR TIME AND

[Captioner] 21:30:38
 THEN 
WISH YOU ALL WELL AND AM

[Captioner] 21:30:41
 GLAD TO 
SEE ALL OF OUR COUNCILMEMBERS 


[Captioner] 21:30:44
AND THE SUPPORT THAT WE HAD LAST 
WEEK ALSO FOR MEMORIAL DAY.
