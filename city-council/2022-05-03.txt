19:38:45 
TH
19:38:49 THANK YOU.
AND WE'LL BEGIN WITH
19:38:52  HARRY AYRE.
>> HELLO.

19:38:58 THIS IS HARRY
19:39:01  AYRE FROM
19:39:04  GILT BERTH COURT FREMONT.
CRIES THE
19:39:07  KING CHURCH NEAR SHINN PARK IN
19:39:11  DISTRICT 3.
THE CITY IS REFUSING TO LISTEN TO
19:39:14  OUR CONCERNS.
I CAN'T SEE HOW OUR DEMOCRATIC
19:39:17  DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED BODY
19:39:20  OBJECTS CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT.
NONE OF OUR RESIDENTS WERE
19:39:23  CONSULTED ABOUT THE PROGRAM.
THE
19:39:26  SAFE PARKING IN CHRIST THE KING CHURCH ARE NOT
19:39:30  FROM RESIDENTS WHO LIVE HERE.
WHEN WE CONTACTED THE CHURCH
19:39:33 , PASTOR KIA AND JIM THE PRESIDENT AND THE CITY
19:39:37  TO START A GENUINE DIALOGUE THEY VILIFIED
19:39:41  US VIA PRESS EVEN BEFORE ATTEMPTING TO TALK TO
19:39:44  US FACE TO FACE.
WE HAVE REPEATEDLY ASKED
19:39:48  FOR DIALOGUES AND
19:39:52  ARE CONTINUALLY STONEWALLED.
YOUR CLAIM THAT WE HAD
19:39:55  A MEETING TO LISTEN TO US IS TRUE.
WE
19:39:58  ULTIMATELY LISTENED TO THEM BUT IT WAS ONE SIDED,
19:40:02  DESIGNED TO SUPPRESS THE COMMON PERSON
19:40:05 'S VOICE AND YOUR OWN STATEMENTS IN THAT
19:40:08  PRIVATE MEETING ADMITTHE CHURCH DID
19:40:11  US DIRTY IN
19:40:14  THE PRAYS WAS DONE.
NOW MAYOR LILY
19:40:19  AND OTHERS ARE CLAIMING NO MORE DIALOGUE ON THIS TOPIC
19:40:23  AND THE SUBJECT IS CLOSED AND THEY WON'T
19:40:26  LISTEN TO MAKE CONCERNS.
HOW IS THIS FAIR?
DISTRICT
19:40:29  3 COUNCILMEMBER JENNY SAYS SHE HAS MADE UP HER MIND
19:40:33  AND WON'T HAVE A DIALOGUE.
ARE WE REALLY IN A DEMOCRATIC
19:40:36  CITY STATE OR COUNTRY?
I HAVE INTERNALLY
19:40:39  SPOKEN TO 200 PLUS RESIDENTS AND NONE OF THEM ARE
19:40:42  HAPPY ABOUT THE WAY THE CITY IS SUPPRESSING OUR VOICES.
19:40:46 
A RECENT TRADITION WITH COMMON SENSE
19:40:49  DEMANDS HAS 360 PLUS SIGNATURES AMOUNTING
19:40:52  TO APPROXIMATELY 1500 TO 2
19:40:56 ,000 OATHS JUST FROM THE SHINN NEIGHBORHOOD.

19:40:59 AND IF THE COUNCIL KNOW OUR STONE WALL OUR
19:41:02  ONLY CHOICE IS TO TALK TO ALL IN ELECTIONS.
ANY AMOUNT
19:41:06  OF FUNDING YOU MIGHT HAVE FROM PRIVATE BUSINESS
19:41:09  AND ENTERPRISES WILL NOT BE SUFFICIENT IF YOU
19:41:13  ANTAGONIZE LOCAL RESIDENTS.
WE ARE NOT AGAINST THE HOMELESS.

19:41:16 WE ARE NOT NIMBYS AS YOU HAVE MADE
19:41:19  US ALL OUT TO BE.
19:41:22 
EVERY LOCATION HAS UNIQUE FACTORS WHICH NEED TO BE
19:41:26  CONSIDERED AND WE WANT IT DONE YET.
27
19:41:29 % YEAR OVER YEAR AND 57% YEAR
19:41:32  OVER YEAR IS WHERE CHRIST THE KING CHURCH IS AND
19:41:35  SAFE PARKING IS.
HOW ARE WE GOING TO PROTECT THE PEOPLE
19:41:38  IN THE CARS, LET ALONE THE
19:41:41  RESIDENTS?
IF YOU THINK THROUGH THIS
19:41:45 , SPECIFIC LOCATION SPECIFIC CONCERNS
19:41:48  AND DISTRICT 3 CONTRIBUTES TO FOUR OF
19:41:51  THE 10, 4
19:41:54  415 HEDGE CALLS AND YOU GUYS HAVE TO COP TO THAT AS
19:41:58  WELL.
THANK YOU.
19:42:05 

19:42:10 >> The Clerk:   BLAIR BEEKMAN IS NEXT.
>> HI, CAN YOU
19:42:13  HEAR ME?
>> The Clerk:   YES.
19:42:16 
>> GREAT, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
AS THERE HAS ALREADY BEEN
19:42:19  YEARS OF OPEN DIALOGUE AND NEGOTIATION FROM
19:42:22  ALL SIDES ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THE UKRAINE AREA
19:42:26 , INCLUDING RECENT ADDITIONAL NEGOTIATION IDEAS,
19:42:29  AS THE UKRAINE CAN JOIN THE EU AND
19:42:33 
THAT RUSSIA CAN POSSIBLY RETURN PARTS OF THE
19:42:37  GEORGIA REPUBLIC I HOPE THAT ALL SIDES
19:42:40  DON'T HAVE TO CONTINUALLY RELY
19:42:43  ON WAR AS WAYS FOR PEOPLE IN THE
19:42:46  UKRAINE REGION TO TRY TO PROVE
19:42:51  THEIR METAL AND
POINTS
19:42:54  OF VIEW TO RETURN TO THE  NEGOTIATING
19:42:58  TABLE.
HOW NUCLEAR
19:43:01  POWER PLANTS CAN RETAIN TO
19:43:05  UKRAINIAN CONTROL AND FOR A FUTURE OF THEIR OWN SELF DETERMINATION
19:43:08  I HOPE WE CAN ALL BE THINKING ABOUT HOW TO BEGIN A
19:43:11  FULL NEGOTIATIVE PROCESS AND PEACEFUL
19:43:14  LONG
TERM CO-HABITATION BETWEEN COUNTRIES
19:43:19  AND COUNTRIES FOR THE FUTURE OF UKRAINE NOW.
AND GOOD IDEAS
19:43:22  FOR SELF DETERMINATION FOR UKRAINE AND NATO
19:43:26 'S ALONG WITH RUSSIA'S SENSE
19:43:29  AND NEED OF NATIONAL SECURITY, BOTH THESE IDEAS CAN
19:43:32  BE ADDRESSED AT THIS TIME AND THESE COUNTRIES
19:43:35  DO NOT, AGAIN,
HAVE TO GO TO WAR IN THE FUTURE
19:43:39 .
AND THAT MEANS ALL OF US, DO NOT HAVE TO GO
19:43:42  TO WAR IN THE FUTURE.
THANK YOU.

19:43:52 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.
NEXT SPEAKER IS SHARON.

19:44:12 >> The Clerk:   SHARON, ARE YOU SPEAK UP PLEASE?
19:44:15 
>> YES.
THIS IS SHARON SHARF
19:44:18  AND I HAVE A COUPLE OF POINTS THAT I WOULD LIKE TO POINT
19:44:21  OUT TO THE CITY COUNCIL.
HOME
19:44:24 LESS ISSUES, NOT BEING ADDRESSED OR
19:44:28  ACCURATELY  ASSESSED, A LOT OF
19:44:31  CRIME, A LOT OF POLICE PRESENCE.
WHAT ARE WE
19:44:34  DOING ABOUT THAT?
ESPECIALLY
19:44:38  IN VALLEJO MILLS AND IN THE NILES AREA.

19:44:42 TWO:
19:44:46   HANS LARSON AND FREMONT DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS IS
19:44:50  NOT ABOUT SAFETY SO LET'S GET THAT CLEARED UP
19:44:53  RIGHT AWAY.
THERE IS
19:44:56  A WHOLE BIKE COMMUNITY WHICH
19:44:59  IS GREAT AND IT'S WONDERFUL AND I'VE RIDDEN
19:45:03  BIKES.
BUT THAT'S REALLY NOT ABOUT SAFETY
19:45:06 .
SO LET'S GET
19:45:09  THAT STRAIGHTENED OUT.

19:45:15 THREE, TRAFFIC DEATHS.
MY NEIGHBOR WAS KILLED IN NILES
19:45:18 .
AND THE POLICE COULD NOT
19:45:23  EVEN
19:45:27  PUBLISH AN ACCURATE REPORT ABOUT HIS DEATH.
HE DIED A
19:45:30  WEEK LATER AND HIS DEATH STILL REMAINS A MYSTERY TO
19:45:33  THIS DAY.

19:45:41 AND IT'S BEING INVESTIGATED BY THE TRAFFIC POLICE.
BOTTOM LINE
19:45:45  IS, WE HAVE LITTLE OR NO POLICE PRESENCE IN FREMONT
19:45:47  FREMONT.
WE HAVE NO RESPONSIBLE SINK LEADERSHIP.

19:45:51 WE HAVE NO RESPONSIBLE HUMAN SERVICES
19:45:55  DEPARTMENT.
SOMETHING HAS GOT TO GIVE HERE.

19:46:01 SO WHAT CAN WE DO TO HELP YOU
19:46:04 ?
THANK YOU.

19:46:13 >> The Clerk:   JOHN HINES IS NEXT.
>> 
19:46:17 HELLO EVERYONE.
THERE IS AN EXCELLENT ARTICLE IN THE CHRONICLE
19:46:21  LAST WEEK ON THE HISTORY OF SAN FRANCISCO'S PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE
19:46:24  HOUSING PROGRAM WHICH IS A FORERUNNER OF
19:46:27  OUR NEW HOMEKEY PROJECT.
THEY HAVE SOME IMPORTANT
19:46:30  FEATURES IN COMMON AND WE SHOULD EXPECT TO FACE SOME
19:46:33  OF THE SAME CHALLENGES.
THE STORY IS A HORROR SHOW
19:46:37 .
SO HIGHLIGHTS.
OF THE TENANTS
19:46:40  WHO EVENTUALLY MOVED OUT OF THIS HOUSING ONE FOURTH MOVED OUT
19:46:43  BY DYING.
MANY OF THOSE WERE OVERDOSES.
19:46:46 
DRUG USE IS WIDESPREAD, AS
19:46:49  ARE FILTH, RATS AND VANDALISM.
SOME TENANTS
19:46:52  LIVE IN FEAR OF THE OTHERS AND THE HOUSING PLACES
19:46:56  ALMOST NO DEMANDS ON TENANTS BEHAVIOR ASIDE FROM
19:46:59  PAYING RENT.
FOR THIS
19:47:02  NEW FORMULA, HOMEKEY FOR A
19:47:05  PREVIEW WE CAN LOOK TO MILPITAS AND SAN JOSE WHO ARE ABOUT
19:47:08  A YEAR AHEAD OF US.
MILPITAS HAS ALREADY
19:47:12  HAD STOLEN VEHICLES FOUND AT A PARKING LOT
19:47:16 .
IT'S ALREADY HAD DRUG
19:47:19  BUSS IN DEALER QUANTITIES.
IT'S
19:47:22  ALREADY HAD A CACHE OF
19:47:25  WEAPONS FOUND AND IT'S ALREADY HAD MURDER OF
19:47:28  A PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE PERSON.
SO WHAT
19:47:31  WOULD HOMEKEY GIVE US THAT WOULD GIVE US SOMETHING
19:47:34  ELSE?
FLOG.
THE STATE
19:47:38  REQUIREMENTS DON'T ALLOW US TO SCREEN APPLICANTS BY THEIR ACTUAL
19:47:41  BEHAVIOR.
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO FOCUS
19:47:46  BY FOCUSING ON THE VULNERABLE BY PUTTING THEM UNDER THE
19:47:49  SAME  ROOF.
ONE THING WE COULD DO IS
19:47:52  ADJUST A SPENDING PLAN TO TAKE A BIG SHARE OF THE
19:47:55  FUNDING SAY 20 OR 25% AND RATHER THAN
19:47:59  HAND IT OVER THE A NEW KIND OF LANDLORD WHO SMILES, USE
19:48:02  IT INSTEAD TO HIRE SWORN POLICE
OFFICERS WHO CAN BE
19:48:05  STATIONED THERE 24-SEVEN ONLY WITH
19:48:08  STRONG OVERWATCH LIKE THIS COULD WE HAVE ANY CHANCE OF
19:48:11  PROTECTING THE VULNERABLE.
THANK YOU.

19:48:21 >> The Clerk:   LISA DANS.

19:48:26 >> HI, THANK YOU.
GOOD EVENING.
THIS IS LISA
19:48:30  DANS I LIVE IN FREMONT CURRENTLY IN DISTRICT 3 AND I'M
19:48:33  A MEMBER OF FREMONT FOR EVERYONE.
I WANT TO THANK THE CITY OF FREMONT
19:48:37  FOR RECOGNIZING AFFORDABLE HOUSING MONTH.
WE HAVE A VERY LONG
19:48:40  WAY TO GO TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE CAN HAVE A SAFE AND
19:48:43  DIGNIFIED ROOF OVER THEIR HEAD AND OUR CONTINUE
19:48:46 ED COMMITMENT TO ADDRESSING THE HOUSING CRISIS IS
19:48:50  CAREFUL IN HAVING A CHANCE
TO SOLVING THAT,
19:48:53  SO GLAD THAT WE HAVE THAT PROCLAMATION
19:48:56  AND THANK YOU FOR THAT.
I HOPE WE HAVE EVEN MORE FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING
19:48:59  AND  ADDRESSING HOMELESSNESS.
THIS ADDRESSES LONG
19:49:02  TERM AS WELL AS SHORT AND MEDIUM TERM SOLUTIONS.
LONG
19:49:06  TERM WE NEED TO ADDRESS OUR HOUSING SHORTAGE SO THERE
19:49:09  IS ROOM FOR EVERYONE.
WE NEED TO STOP PRICE
19:49:12 ING EVERYONE OUT TO FURTHER AWAY, WHICH CAUSES
19:49:16  MORE CO2 POLLUTION.
WE NEED TO STOP
19:49:19  PRICING PEOPLE OUT OF THEIR HOMES INTO LIVING
19:49:23  IN THEIR CARS OR ON THE STREET.
THE ONLY WAY TO
19:49:26  ACHIEVE THAT LONG TERM, IS
19:49:30  TO REVERSE THE DECADES
19:49:33  LONG, HOUSING PROGRAM
19:49:36 .
I WANT TO THANK THE CITY HOUSING STAFF FOR
19:49:39  THEIR PROACTIVE
19:49:43  HOUSING FOR EVERYONE AND ENGAGING WITH US ABOUT THE HOUSING
19:49:46  ELEMENT UPDATE.
I HOPE WE ACHIEVE A HOUSING
19:49:50  ELEMENT THAT GETS US ENOUGH DOWN THE ROAD FOR
19:49:54  HOUSING FOR EVERYBODY WHO LIVES HERE.
ANOTHER TOOL
19:49:57  IS LEVERAGING STATE FUNDING TO BOOST THE AMOUNT OF
19:50:00  AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT WE HAVE HERE IN FREMONT.
THAT'S WHY
19:50:03  I'M SO GRATEFUL THAT FREMONT HAS APPLIED FOR THE PROJECT HOME
19:50:07 KEY FUNDING AND I SINCERELY HOPE WE ARE AWARD
19:50:10 ED THE GRANT.
AFFORDABLE HOUSING SUCH AS PROJECT
19:50:13  HOMEKEY IS PART OF THE CRITICAL SOLUTION TO  HOMELESSNESS
19:50:17 .
AS I MENTIONED WE NEED BOTH LONG AND SHORT
19:50:20  TERM SOLUTIONS BECAUSE WE CAN'T BUILD ALL THE HOUSING
19:50:23  WE NEED OVERTIME AND WE NEED TO ALLEVIATE
19:50:27  THE WORST IMPACTS.
I'M GRATEFUL TO THE
19:50:31  SAFE PARKING PROGRAM, I'M LOOKING FORWARD
19:50:35  TO VOLUNTEERING LATER THIS WEEK.
OTHER PARTS OF
19:50:38  THE SAFE PARKING PROGRAM INCLUDING HOSTING A
19:50:42  CITY OWNED LOT SO WE CAN SERVE EVEN MORE PEOPLE WHO ARE LIVING
19:50:45  IN THEIR VEHICLES.
SO LET'S TURN OUR GREAT ENTHUSIASM
19:50:48  FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING MONTH INTO ACTION, AND GO EVEN FURTHER
19:50:51  TO HELP SOLVE OUR HOUSING AND HOMELESS
19:50:55 NESS CRISIS.
THANK YOU.
>> The Clerk:   THANK
19:50:58  YOU.
ANNA CHAN IS THE NEXT
19:51:01  SPEAKER.
>> HI, MY NAME IS ANNA
19:51:04  AND I'M A VERY CONCERNED CITIZEN OF FREMONT ON THE SAFE PARK
19:51:07 ING PILOT PROGRAM THAT IS CURRENTLY IN ROTATION.
I WANT TO
19:51:10  ECHO WHAT HARRY FROM THE
19:51:13  SHINN NEIGHBORHOOD JUST MENTIONED
19:51:17 , ALONG WITH THE NOTES WE HAD ON CHRIST THE KING
19:51:20  CHURCH ON 13
19:51:23 01 MOWRY AVENUE.
CHRIST THE KING CHURCH HOST
19:51:27  ANOTHER COMMUNITY MEETING TO SOLICIT VOLUNTEERS
19:51:30  AND IDEAS ON HOW TO RUN THIS PROGRAM AT THEIR
19:51:33  SITE STARTING THIS JUNE.
IT WAS CONFIRMED BY THE PASTOR
19:51:36  OF THE CHURCH THAT THE PROGRAM VOLUNTEERS WILL ONLY BE ON
19:51:39  SITE DURING SPECIFIC SLOTS BUT THE SAFE PARKING
19:51:43  PROGRAM PARTICIPANT CAN CHECK THEMSELVES IN AFTER THAT SLOT
19:51:46 .
FOR EXAMPLE IF THE CHECK IN IS AVAILABLE AT 7
19:51:50  P.M. VOLUNTEERS ONSITE WILL BE BETWEEN 7
19:51:53  TO 7:30 TO CHECK THEM IN.
19:51:56 
VOLUNTEERS LEAVE THE SIDE AT  7:30 THEN PARTICIPANTS
19:51:59  ARE CONTINUING TO WELCOME TO CHECK THEMSELVES
19:52:03  IN, NO MONITORS WHATSOEVER BESIDES SELF
19:52:06  CHECK IN OR OTHER CHECK IN PARTICIPANTS.
THIS TO ME IS
19:52:09  THE BIGGEST FLAW OF ALL.
WITH NO SURVEILLANCE CAMERA
19:52:12  NOR GATES INSTALLED AT THE SITE, WHAT IF SOMEONE DECIDE
19:52:16  TO CRASH THE PARTY AT 11 P.M. TO 2
19:52:19  A.M. AND IT'S NOT ONE OF THE ACTUAL PARTICIPANTS OF THE PROGRAM.

19:52:23 CHURCH RESPONDED THAT ALL PARTICIPANTS ONSITE
19:52:26  ARE SUPPOSED TO BE SELF MONITOR BEING EACH OTHER AND
19:52:30  KEEP THEMSELVES SAFE BY REPORTING TO THE HOT LINE DESIGNATE
19:52:33 ED FOR THIS PROGRAM.
BUT THIS LOOPHOLE BY
19:52:36  ITSELF IS VERY UNSAFE IN CONSIDERATION FOR THE ACTUAL PARK
19:52:39 ING PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS AND SURROUNDING NEIGHBORHOODS AND COMMUNITIES.

19:52:42 IN ADDITION, THE CURRENT PARTICIPATING CHURCH IN THE MONTH OF
19:52:46  APRIL ADMITTED THAT THERE ARE PARTICIPANTS THAT ARE NOT LEAVING THE SITE
19:52:49  BY THEIR CURRENT DESIGNATE
19:52:52 ED CHECK OUT SLOT AND THESE LIMITS
19:52:55 
WERE ESCALATED TO FREMONT FOR RESOLUTION.

19:52:58 CONCERNING THAT CHRIST THE KING CHURCH ACTUALLY HAVE
19:53:03  A K EDONGLE PRESCHOOL ON
19:53:07 SITE THIS IS ANOTHER SAFETY CONCERN MEASURE.
WITH OTHERS
19:53:10  I JUST SITED THE
19:53:14  SAVE PARKING SITE, INCREASED PATROLS FROM
19:53:17  FPD IN OUR COMMUNITIES ARE VERY REASONABLE AND SHOULD BE
19:53:21  RECONSIDERED BY THE CITY OF FREMONT AND THE  HOMELESS SERVICE
DEPARTMENT
19:53:24  TO ENHANCE THE OVERALL DESIGN OF THIS PROGRAM.
AFTER
19:53:27  ALL, THE PILOT PROGRAM ITSELF IS NOT SAFE
19:53:30  AT ITS CURRENT DESIGN AND SHOULD NOT
19:53:34  BE ROLLED OUT UNTIL THOSE DESIGN FLAWS ARE CORRECT
19:53:36 ED.
THANK YOU.
>> The Clerk:   THANK YOU.

19:53:39 THE NEXT SPEAKER IS JOHN.

19:54:04 >> HI, I'M
19:54:08  -- THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY.
I'M SPEAKING OUT IN SUPPORT OF THE
19:54:11  SAFE PARKING PROGRAM AT CHRIST THE KING CHURCH.
I LIVE
19:54:14  TWO MINUTES AWAY FROM THE SITE, LOOKING FORWARD TO HELPING OUT THERE
19:54:17 .
AND, YOU KNOW, I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND WHY NEIGHBORS WOULD HAVE
19:54:20  SUCH A PROBLEM WITH HAVING SOME VETTED PEOPLE WHO
19:54:23  FIND THEMSELVES UNHOUSED TO STAY IN THE CHURCH PARKING
19:54:27  LOT OVERNIGHT HAVING TO LEAVE
BY 6:30 IN THE MORNING
19:54:30  AND WITH CHRISTIAN
19:54:33  CHURCH MEMBERS LIVING THEIR FAITH AND HELPING THEM OUT
19:54:36  WHEN THERE ARE SO MANY UNHOUSED PEOPLE LIVING IN OUR
19:54:39  NEIGHBORHOOD.
I THINK ONE REASON IS THEY'RE
19:54:43  SCARED AND UN
19:54:46 ROLL AGAINST  PEOPLE, THEY AND MANY
19:54:49  OTHERS USE HOMELESS AS A PEJORATIVE
19:54:53  TERM.
SAYING THEY ARE GOING TO BRING CRIME
19:54:56 , DRUGS, OTHERS OF THEIR TYPE.
THE
19:54:59  EXACT SAME RECORD HAS BEEN USED AGAINST MANY OTHER GROUPS
19:55:02  IN THE PAST RIGHT HERE IN FREMONT AGAINST
19:55:05  INDIANS, AGAINST JEWS, AGAINST
19:55:08  BLACKS, HISPANICS, ASIANS, THESE
19:55:12  ARE DARK PARTS OF FREMONT'S
HISTORY
19:55:15 .
I HAVE FRIENDS GROWING UP HERE IN THE
19:55:19  80s, 90s, N WORD OR
19:55:22  WORSE, BEING HARASSED AS A BLACK
19:55:25  STEEN AGER, FOLLOWED, THREATENED
19:55:28  BY PEOPLE CARRYING GUNS.
ESPECIALLY THE PROCLAMATIONS
19:55:31 , ASIAN PACIFIC AMERICAN HERITAGE MONTH,
19:55:34  JEWISH AMERICAN
19:55:37  MONTH, AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING MONTH.
IF YOU DO HAVE SUCH A
19:55:41  FEAR OF THE UNHOUSED IF YOU BELIEVE THAT IT'S NOT OKAY
19:55:44  TO DISCRIMINATE AGAINST THESE RACIAL ROOTS,
19:55:47  YOU DO THINK IT'S OKAY TO
19:55:51  DISCRIMINATE AGAINST PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE A HOUSE,
THINK
19:55:54  ABOUT WHY YOU FEEL THAT WAY.
DO YOU BELIEVE THAT OWNING A
19:55:58  HOUSE MAKES YOU A BETTER PERSON OR YOU PAY SO MUCH IN PROPERTY
19:56:01  TAXES YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE TO LOOK AT PEOPLE WHO ARE LESS ADVANTAGED THAN YOU
19:56:04 ?
YOU KNOW THAT COULD -- SEPARATING INTO
19:56:07  THEY THEY ARE THE HOMELESS THEY ARE THE LAZY DEGENERATE
19:56:11 ED LEECH ON SOCIETY DRUG ADDICTED
19:56:15  CRIMINALS AGAINST US,
19:56:18  THERE IS NONE UNHOUSED IN FREMONT, THOSE
19:56:21  IN
FREMONT LONGER THAN SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO CURRENTLY LIVE IN HOUSES
19:56:25 .
SO, YOU KNOW, I -- YOU KNOW I
19:56:28  ENCOURAGE EVERYONE ANYBODY
19:56:32  WHO IS ENCOURAGED BY THESE PROGRAMS
19:56:35  GO MEET THE PARTICIPANTS VOLUNTEER, IF YOU ARE
19:56:38  CONCERNED AROUND SAFETY I THINK ONE OF THE BEST WAYS TO
ADDRESS THAT
19:56:42  IS TO ACTUALLY PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM AND VOLUNTEER
19:56:45 .
I THINK GOING THROUGH THOSE STEPS WILL ACTUALLY I THINK
19:56:48  PEOPLE WILL THEN YOU KNOW REALLY UNDERSTAND
19:56:51  MUCH MORE ABOUT THE PROGRAM AND BECOME IN SUPPORT
19:56:54  OF IT.
THANK YOU.

19:57:00 >> The Clerk:   THANK YOU.
AND THE NEXT SPEAKER IS KATHRYN.

19:57:06 >> HI, THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH.
AGAIN, I WANT TO THANK
19:57:10  OUR FREMONT CITY COUNCIL FOR BEING PRO
19:57:13 ACTIVE ABOUT VOTING FOR THE AGENCY,
19:57:16  THE SAFE PARKING PROGRAMS AND
19:57:20  THE DESIRED PROJECT HOMEKEY PLAN.
WE ALL
19:57:23  KNOW THAT HOMELESSNESS HAS
19:57:26  BECOME A HUGE ISSUE OVER THE
19:57:30  LAST DECADE.
AND IT'S ONLY GETTING
19:57:33  WORSE, AS
19:57:36  EVICTION MORATORIUMS COME INTO EXPIRATION
19:57:40  DATES.
AND REPAYMENTS ARE
19:57:43  EXPECTED.
AND NOT EVERYBODY WAS ABLE
19:57:46  TO GET FUNDING TO HELP WITH THOSE
19:57:49  REPAYMENTS.
AND PEOPLE ARE STILL STRUGGLING
19:57:52  WITH JOB LOSS OR BEING UNDERPAID
19:57:56  UNDERPAID.
19:58:08 
AND EVEN THOUGH I WAS NOT PART OF THE
19:58:12  CORONAVIRUS CODONE ISSUE, I WAS PRICED OUT OF OUR HOME
19:58:15  BECAUSE OF EXCEPTIONALLY HIGH RENT AND MY
19:58:18  SPOUSE AND I BOTH BECOMING AGED AND DISABLED AND
19:58:21  WE COULD JUST
NOT KEEP UP WITH EMPLOYMENT AND
19:58:24  THUS OUR RENT.

19:58:27 AND IT
19:58:31  REALLY OFFENDS ME THAT THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE HERE WHO DO NOT UNDERSTAND
19:58:34  WHO THE HOMELESS ARE
19:58:42  WHY THEY'RE  HOMELESS HOW THESE THINGS COME TO BE
19:58:45  AND PAINT US AS PEOPLE WHO ARE CRIMINAL BY
THE
19:58:49  VERY NATURE OF BEING HOMELESS.
AND I REALLY OBJECT TO
19:58:52  THIS BECAUSE MY SPOUSE AND I BOTH ARE
19:58:55  HIGHLY EDUCATED, WE BOTH WORKED,
19:58:58  WE'VE BOTH PAID INTO THE TAX SYSTEM AND WE
19:59:02  JUST EVENTUALLY ENDED UP HOMELESS AS A RESULT OF
19:59:06  BEING OLDER
AND DISABLED.
WE
19:59:11  HAVE
19:59:17  NOT BEEN ADDICTS, WE ARE
19:59:20  NOT ENGAGED IN VIOLENT OR CRIMINAL ACTIVITY AND IT
19:59:23  REALLY BOTHERS ME EVERY TIME I HEAR PEOPLE START
19:59:26  PAINTING ME INTO THAT CORNER.
MOST HOMELESS
19:59:29  PEOPLE ARE IN MY KIND OF A SITUATION.
WE
19:59:32  ENDED UP HOMELESS AS A RESULT OF CIRCUMSTANCES
19:59:36  THAT WERE BEYOND OUR CONTROL.
NOT BECAUSE
19:59:39  WE MADE BAD CHOICES.
OR
19:59:42  WERE IRRESPONSIBLE.
AND I
19:59:45  REALLY WANT TO CONTINUE PROMOTE
19:59:49 ING THE IDEA THAT WE NEED TO RESOLVE
19:59:52  THIS ISSUE BY PROVIDING HOUSING FOR HOMELESS PEOPLE
19:59:56 .
AND IF WE KEEP OBJECTING TO EVERY SINGLE
19:59:59  PLAN WE'RE PUTTING ON THE BLOCK, THEN WE'RE JUST GOING TO
20:00:02  KEEP HAVING HOMELESS PEOPLE LIVING ON THE SIDEWALKS WHICH IS NOT
20:00:05  A GOOD ALTERNATIVE.
20:00:09 
>> The Clerk:   THANK YOU.
NEXT SPEAKER IS NARD
20:00:12 O.
20:00:21 
>> THANK YOU.
I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE ATTEND
20:00:25  ATTENDING CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS FOR BEING HERE.
I AM FROM DISTRICT 3.
20:00:28 
IT'S VERY ALARMING THAT OUR REPRESENTATIVE IS
20:00:31  OFTEN NOT PRESENT AT THESE MEETINGS
20:00:34 .
AND
20:00:37  I WANT TO, ON PART OF THE SHINL
20:00:41  SHINN NEIGHBORHOOD GROUP, I WOULD
20:00:44  LIKE TO VERY EMPHATICALLY SAY WE ARE
20:00:47  NOT AGAINST THE SAFE PARKING PROGRAM.
20:00:50 
WE ARE CONCERNED
20:00:54  ABOUT THE INDIVIDUALS, OUR NEIGHBORS
20:00:57  WHO HAVE TO RESORT TO SLEEPING IN THEIR CARS
20:01:00 .
OUR OUTRAGE IS
20:01:04  WITH THE
20:01:08  BASIC, AND HOW
20:01:12  MUCH BETTER THIS PROGRAM COULD BE.
TO SIMPLY JUST OFFER
20:01:15  SOMEBODY A PLACE TO PARK AND THEN WANT TO
20:01:18  PAT OURSELVES ON THE BACK, IT'S NOT
20:01:21  JUST SOMETHING THAT WE WANT TO RELATE TO.
WE DON'T
20:01:25  WANT TO, YOU KNOW, WE DON'T WANT TO ENDORSE A
20:01:28  PROGRAM THAT THINKS THIS IS GOOD ENOUGH.
WE'LL
20:01:31  JUST HAVE THEM PARK SOMEWHERE AND THAT'S ALL THERE IS TO IT
20:01:35 .
20:01:39 
SO RIGHT NOW YOU ARE ALL,
20:01:43  MAYOR MEI, YOU ARE FACING A LOT OF
20:01:46  PUSH BACK FROM THE WARM SPRINGS
20:01:50  NEIGHBORS FROM DISTRICT 3 AND A LARGE GROUP OF CONSTITUENTS SO I
20:01:53  HIGHLY RECOMMEND AND WOULD HOPE THAT YOU
WOULD BE WILLING TO
20:01:56  OPEN CONVERSATIONS ABOUT BETTER PROGRAMS.
20:01:59 
ABOUT BETTEROUT REACH.
TO TRULY MAKE IT
20:02:03  BETTER
20:02:07  OUTREACH.
PEOPLE OVER POLITICS
20:02:10  IN FREMONT.
YOU CAN HAVE A LOT OF SUPPORT RIGHT NOW IN
20:02:13  PUTTING PROGRAMS TOGETHER.
THERE ARE A LOT OF
20:02:17  OTHER KIND OF FUNDING THAT COULD BE BROUGHT IN TO WORK THROUGH NON
20:02:20 PROFITS AND OTHER AGENCIES, TO PUT BETTER PROGRAMS TOGETHER.

20:02:23 THE CITY DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THE ALL AND
20:02:26  THE FUNDING FOR ALL.
YOU CAN ACTUALLY -- WE CAN ACTUALLY
20:02:29  WORK AS A COMMUNITY, GOVERNMENT AND CONSTITUENTS.
I
20:02:32  STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT WE GET BACK TO THE DRAWING
20:02:37  BOARD, AND WHEN THIS MEASURE WAS PASSED, YOU
20:02:40  KNOW, IT WAS COVID AND IT WAS VERY -- THE RESOURCES THAT
20:02:44  YOU ALL HAD AVAILABLE
20:02:47  WERE VERY MINIMAL.
WE CAN DO
20:02:50  BETTER TOGETHER.
MAYOR LILY
20:02:53  MEI, COUNCILMEMBERS PRESENT, WE CAN DO BETTER.
ALLOW US TO OPEN
20:02:56  A CONVERSATION
20:03:00  AND COME UP WITH SOMETHING THAT WE ALL CAN FEEL PROUD OF
20:03:03 .
AND TRULY SUPPORT THESE
20:03:06  INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE -- WHO DO NOT HAVE A
20:03:09  HOME AT THIS POINT.
THANK YOU.
>> The Clerk:   THANK YOU.

20:03:12 THE NEXT SPEAKER IS AN
20:03:15 KIT.
20:03:25 
>> HELLO GUYS CAN YOU HEAR ME?
>> The Clerk:   YES.
20:03:28 
>> I'M ANKIT AND I'VE
20:03:31  LIVED AT PARKMONT
20:03:35  FOR TEN YEARS.
I'M LOOKING TO
20:03:38  NOT SUPPORT  PARKING AT
20:03:42  CHRIST
20:03:46  IT'S CASE MONTESSORI
20:03:49  IS RIGHT NEXT DOOR.
CHILDCARE LICENSING LAW
20:03:53  AND COUNCIL EXPORTING KIDS AT RISK.
20:03:56 
SECOND POINT IS IT'S .8 MILES AWAY
20:04:00  FROM PARKMONT ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.
AGAIN
20:04:03  COUNCIL IS PUTTING SKIDS AT RISK.
SAFE PARKING
20:04:06  RESIDENTS ARE NOT GOING TO BE FORCED TO LEAVE BEFORE KIDS
20:04:09  START GOING TO SCHOOL SO COUNCIL IS PUTTING
20:04:12  KIDS AT RISK WHO WOULD BE WALKING TO SCHOOL.
FOURTH
20:04:15  POINT IS SAFE PARKING IS RIGHT OPPOSITE TO
20:04:19  PUBLIC PARK NEAR SHINN PARK
20:04:22 .
SORRY TO SAY
20:04:26  BUT COUNCIL IS AGAIN PUTTING
20:04:29  CHILDREN AT RISK.
THERE ARE NO CAMERAS OR
20:04:32  NO VOLUNTEERS AT SITE.

20:04:36 SO THOSE ARE THE REASONS I'M NOT SUPPORTING SAFE PARKING
20:04:39  AT CHRIST THE KING
20:04:42 .
THANK YOU.

20:04:55 >> The Clerk:   NEXT SPEAKER IS YASHW
20:04:58 AN.

20:05:06 YASHWAN.
NEED TO UN
20:05:10 MUTE.

20:05:26 OKAY WE'LL MOVE ON TO CEDA.

20:05:29 >> HELLO CAN YOU HEAR ME?
>> YES.
>> HI
20:05:32 , MY NAME IS SHIVA.
I LIVE
20:05:35  IN SHINN COURT IN DISTRICT 3.
I WOULD LIKE
20:05:39  TO SECOND HAR
20:05:42 RY AND ANNA'S REGARDING
20:05:46  THE SAFE  PARKING PROGRAM AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS PROGRAM
20:05:50 .
MYSELF I'M NOT AGAINST THE PROGRAM I'M JUST AGAINST
20:05:53  THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS PROGRAM THAT ARE A LITTLE BIT
20:05:56  FLAWS IN THE PROGRAM, WHICH I THINK SHOULD BE CONSIDERED
20:05:59 .
BEFORE IMPLEMENTATION.
I
20:06:03  PERSONALLY HAVE BEEN INFECTED BY
20:06:06  THE HOMELESSNESS
20:06:10 , NEIGHBOR NEXT TO ME, HE
20:06:13  HAD A TREE BURNED BEHIND
20:06:17  HIS HOUSE BY A DRIFTER AND
20:06:20  HAVE HAD MULTIPLE CAUSE
20:06:24 , REGARDING HOMELESSNESS BEHIND OUR HOMES IN
20:06:27  THE
FACTORY BUT ALL THESE CALLS HAVE BEEN DIRECT
20:06:30 ED ONLY WITHOUT IN REGARD TO US
20:06:33 .
SO WE WOULD LIKE TO ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT THIS PROGRAM IN A
20:06:36  SAFER WAY AND IN ORDER TO DO THAT, WE WOULD LIKE
20:06:40  TO ACTUALLY PRESS CITY TO
20:06:43  HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH US TO UNDERSTAND WHAT
20:06:46  OUR CONCERNS ARE
20:06:53  AND
THEN PUT THE BARRIERS TO HAVE THESE THINGS NOT
20:06:56  TO HAPPEN AND PROVIDE SAFETY FOR THE NEIGHBORS AND ALSO THE
20:06:59  CHURCH AND ALL THE
20:07:02  STATE BORDERS INCLUDING THE PARTICIPANTS OF THE PROGRAM.
WE
20:07:06  HAVE IN PREVIOUSLY  ENCOUNTERED SO MANY
20:07:10  HOMELESS ISSUES, IN THE PAST FOUR MONTHS WE HAVE
20:07:13  HAD MULTIPLE PEOPLES ACTUALLY MOVING OR LOOTING THE
20:07:17  HOMES AND ALSO, OPENING THE CARS IN THE
MIDNIGHT.
20:07:20 
SO HOW IS THIS INSTANCES NOT
20:07:23  GOING TO BE AFFECTING THE  HOMELESS PART
20:07:26  I WONDER?
SO I WOULD ACTUALLY ASK
20:07:29  THE CITY TO OPEN UP A
20:07:33  CONVERSATION WITH US IN CONCERN
20:07:36  TO THIS.
THANK YOU.
>> The Clerk:   THANK YOU.

20:08:21  READING AND ADOPTION OF AN ORDINANCE
OF THE CITY OF FREMONT
20:08:25 , ADDING FREMONT MUNICIPAL CODE TITLE
20:08:28  8 HEALTH AND SAFETY.

>> HI, BLAIR BEEKMAN
20:08:46  HERE.
THANKS A LOT FOR ALLOWING THREE MINUTES
20:08:49  ON PUBLIC COMMENT PREVIOUSLY.
FOR THIS ITEM I WANTED
20:08:52  TO COMBINE ITEMS
20:08:56  C AND H.
I THINK
20:08:59  IT IS ABOUT THE PEDESTRIAN ISSUES.
YOU KNOW MY
20:09:02  FEELINGS ON THE FUTURE OF SURVEILLANCE
20:09:06  AND TECHNOLOGY, OPEN PUBLIC POLICY, GOOD
20:09:09  PRACTICES AND IT WAS FLIES
20:09:12  NICE TO HEAR THAT I HOPE FROM LAST WEEK THAT WE
20:09:15  CAN LEARN THE LANGUAGE OF
TALKING ABOUT OUR EQUIPMENT
20:09:18 , THAT IT IS MILITARY EQUIPMENT THAT
20:09:21  WE'RE DEALING WITH AND WE'RE JUST LEARNING
20:09:25  HOW TO DESCRIBE, USE THOSE WORDS AND IT'S DIFFICULT FOR
20:09:28  US, IT'S A LEARNING PROCESS, THE
SAME WITH OPENNESS
20:09:31  AND ACCOUNTABILITY AND THE FUTURE OF TECHNOLOGY
20:09:35 .
YOU HAD AN ITEM OF KIDS PRACTICING
20:09:38  TECHNOLOGY AS TOOLS FOR OUR FUTURE.
20:09:41 
OBAMA TALKS ABOUT THAT OFTEN.
OPENNESS
20:09:44  IS HELPFUL IN THAT PROCESS.
IT IS THE IDEAS OF
20:09:48  INNOVATION.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.


20:09:51 >> Mayor Mei:   I BELIEVE THERE IS ALSO AN ORDINANCE THAT THE

COMMUNITY AND HOW, YOU KNOW, HOW
20:12:31  DO WE PREPARE FOR THE FUTURE OF COVID,

FUNDING FROM THE
20:14:06  FEDERAL LEVEL I'VE TRIED TO REPORT HERE
20:14:09  THAT'S GONE TO THE STATE LEVEL.
THEY'VE CREATED THEIR OWN
20:14:12   FUNDING THEY'RE CREATING THEIR OWN FUNDING PROGRAMS
20:14:15  THAT'S MEANT TO CREATE A FUTURE OF GOOD
20:14:19  HEALTHY PROGRAM FOR OUR COMMUNITIES IN THE FUTURE.
THAT MEANS WE
20:14:22  CAN START TO REALLY BETTER CONSIDER THE CONCEPTS OF
20:14:25  SUBSIDY IN THE FUTURE.
IT'S MORE THAN JUST HOMEKEY
20:14:29  PROGRAMS.
IT IS THE IDEAS I THINK THAT WE ALREADY HAVE GOOD IDEAS IN
20:14:32  THE FUTURE OF HOW DO WE HOUSE OUR  UNHOUSED AND WE
20:14:35  CAN JUST LEARN TO HAVE, TO BETTER FLY
20:14:38  THOSE PRACTICES RIGHT NOW WITH THE FEATURE OF
SUBSIDY.

20:18:58 
MR. BEEKMAN.
>> HI, BLAIR
20:19:02  BEEKMAN. HERE
20:19:06 .
HOPEFULLY THIS CAN BE RELEVANT TO
20:19:09  THIS TOPIC OR WHAT I WANTED TO SPEAK ABOUT.
AS THIS IS
20:19:13  ABOUT THE FUTURE OF DEVELOPMENT FOR THE DOWNTOWN AREA
20:19:16 , SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGY DATA COLLECTION IT WILL BE AN IMPORTANT
20:19:19  PART OF THIS PROCESS AND I'M TRYING TO FIND WAYS THAT EACH
20:19:22  LOCAL
COMMUNITY CAN COME UP WITH AND FIND WAYS TO MAKE
20:19:26  THEIR TECHNOLOGY PROCESS MORE OPEN AND ACCOUNTABLE IN THE
20:19:29  FUTURE FOR THEIR COMMUNITY
20:19:32 .
IS IT THIS SORT OF PROJECT THAT CAN BE THE WAY TO DO THAT
20:19:35 ?
IS IT THE -- WHAT WAS
20:19:38  THE OTHER ITEM, IT WAS THE MILITARY HARDWARE OR
20:19:42  THE PEDESTRIAN  CROSSING.
IS PEDESTRIAN CROSSING
20:19:45  THE FUTURE OF THAT ISSUE IS THAT A WAY TO INVITE THE PUBLIC
20:19:49  TO SHARE IN THE PROCESS OF THE SURVEILLANCE AND
20:19:52  DATA COLLECTION TECHNOLOGY YOU WILL BE PLACING IN THE COMMUNITY
20:19:55 , MAKE
IT A MORE ACCESSIBLE OPEN AND UNDERSTAND
20:19:58  UNDERSTANDABLE PROCESS?
I JUST THOUGHT I WOULD BRING THAT UP AT THIS TIME
20:20:02 .
AS CHOICE YOU
20:20:06  CAN HAVE TO DO THAT.
20:20:10 
GOOD LUCK IN THOSE EFFORTS.
I
20:20:14  KNOW ALONG FREMONT BOULEVARD YOU'RE BUILDING THE FUTURE
20:20:19  OF AN IOT PROJECT, THAT WILL BE ACCESSIBLE
20:20:22  TOO AND THAT WILL GO BY CAPITOL AVENUE

20:21:19   UNANIMOUSLY.
8A.
20:21:22 
COUNCIL ASSIGNMENTS THE OUTSIDE COMMITTEES AND COMMISSION
20:21:26 S.
I THINK THERE WERE SOME -- ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE COUNCILMEMBERS
20:21:31 ?
20:21:34 
OKAY.
AND OPEN THE
20:21:38  PUBLIC COMMENT.

20:21:41 AND THEN I SEE NONE SO I'LL CLOSE THE PUBLIC COMMENT.

20:21:45 AND SO WE'LL BRING IT BACK TO THE
20:21:48  COUNCIL.
CAN WE GET A MOTION FOR
20:21:52  THIS, THIS HAS
20:21:56  BEEN UPDATED.
COUNCILMEMBER COX.
>> Councilmember Cox:   YES, I
20:22:00  WANTED TO SEE HOW, I APPRECIATE THAT I
20:22:03  HAD SENT AN E-MAIL ON APRIL
20:22:06  THE 12th TO HAVE THE CHART UPDATED.
AND I WOULD LIKE TO
20:22:09  HAVE IT REFLECTED, THAT IT'S
20:22:13  BEEN AMENDED AS OF TODAY.
BECAUSE IT'S NOT
20:22:16  THE ORIGINAL THAT WAS ADOPTED BACK ON MARCH THE
20:22:19  9th OF 2021.
20:22:23 
AND THAT FOR THE EAST BAY COMMUNITY ENERGY
20:22:27  BOARD, IT SHOULD BE STATED THAT
20:22:30  THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS MEETINGS ARE HELD THE
20:22:33  THIRD WEDNESDAY OF EACH MONTH.
AND
20:22:37  THAT THERE COULD BE OTHER SPECIAL
20:22:41  MEETINGS THAT ARE BEING HELD AS WELL AS DIRECTED
20:22:44  BY THE AGENCY.
BUT WE SHOULD NOT LEAVE
20:22:47  IT AS WHEN, UNDER THAT
20:22:51  COLUMN, AS STATED AS ON THE CURRENT SHEET OF
20:22:54  PAPER I'M LIKING AT AS TO BE DETERMINED.
BECAUSE
20:22:57  THAT'S NOT CORRECT.
IT SHOULD BE REFLECT
20:23:02 ING THOSE SPECIFIC MEETING DATES
20:23:06 .
20:23:10 
>> The Clerk:   WE CAN GO BACK TO THE CLERK OF THE BOARD
20:23:13  ADRIAN BANKHEAD AND CONFIRM THAT INFORMATION IF YOU
20:23:16  WOULD LIKE TO DO THAT.
>> Mayor Mei: 
20:23:19   THERE ARE A COUPLE OF THINGS FOR THE EAST BAY COMMUNITY ENERGY.
THERE
20:23:22  IS THE BOARD MEETINGS AND THEN THERE ARE COMMITTEES
20:23:25  WHICH PEOPLE ARE ASSIGNED TO IN THE BEGINNING OF
20:23:28  EACH CYCLE.
AND THOSE ARE ASSIGNED BY
20:23:32  THE CHAIR OF THE EAST BAY COMMUNITY ENERGY AND THEN
20:23:35  THERE'S ALSO A SEPARATE SUBCOMMITTEE THAT I SERVE ON WHICH IS
20:23:38  THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE.
20:23:42 
WHICH FOR SPECIFIC NOT TO THE AGENCY BUT MORE
20:23:45  TO THE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE REQUESTED TO BE ON THE
20:23:48  BOARD, EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE.
SEPARATE
20:23:52  FROM THE ACTUAL BOARD.
SO THERE'S TWO
20:23:55  DIFFERENT PIECES, A COUPLE DIFFERENT PIECES OF THAT.
20:23:58 
>> Councilmember Cox:   CAN WE MAKE SURE THAT'S DOCUMENTED BECAUSE IT IS 
20:24:01 NOT DOCUMENTED AT ALL TO SAY THAT, TO BE DETERMINED, THAT IS
20:24:05  NOT CORRECT.
AND WE REALLY SHOULD REFLECT THAT IT IS TRANSPARENT
20:24:08  AND THAT WE'RE STATING
20:24:11  THAT WE ARE ACCOUNTING FOR THAT.
SO IF THAT
20:24:14  WOULD BE GREAT IF THE CITY CLERK COULD --
>> The Clerk: 
20:24:17   WE CAN GO BACK TO MR. BANK
20:24:21 HEAD AND CONFIRM THAT INFORMATION
20:24:25 .
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT
20:24:28  TO APPROVE THE SPREAD
20:24:31  SPREADSHEET, SORRY, THE EXHIBIT A AS-IS OR
20:24:34  IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO APPROVE THE SPREADSHEET
20:24:38  MINUS THE EBCE  ITEMS, WE
20:24:41  DO HAVE THE NEW APPOINTMENT
20:24:44  OF
VICE MAYOR SALWAN TO THE
20:24:47  SOUTHERN ALAMEDA COUNTY GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEMS JOINT POWERS
20:24:51  AUTHORITY, THAT IS THE ONLY NEW APPOINTMENT THAT OCCURS ON THIS
20:24:54 .
AND WE NEED TO GET THIS
20:24:58  APPOINTMENT COMPLETED BECAUSE I THINK THEY HAVE A MEETING.
NOT
20:25:01  SURE IF IT'S NEXT WEEK OR THE FOLLOWING WEEK, WEDNESDAY
20:25:06 .
>> Mayor Mei:   I'M FINE WITH MOVING FORWARD ON THIS
20:25:09  EXCEPT FOR THE ITEM BLOCKED FOR WHEN, FOR
20:25:12  EXHIBIT A FOR EAST BAY COMMUNITY ENERGY AND WE'LL FOLLOW ONE
20:25:16  MR. ADRIAN BANKHEAD BECAUSE I DO
20:25:19  WANT TO GET
VICE MAYOR SALWAN ON THAT SO WE
20:25:22  CAN MAKE SURE WE HAVE REPRESENTATION FOR US.
>> Councilmember Cox: 
20:25:25   THERE IS ONE OTHER THING THAT I THINK NEEDS TO BE CLEARED AND THAT
20:25:28  WAS ALSO WRITTEN IN MY LETTER.
THE OTHER PART IS WE --
20:25:31  THE CHANGES THAT ARE OCCURRING ARE NOT REFLECTING WHAT WAS DONE
20:25:34  A YEAR AGO.
AND WITH THOSE CHANGES TO BE REALLY ACCURATE
20:25:37  IT SHOULD BE AS AMENDED.
AS OF TODAY'S MEETING
20:25:41 .
AND ONCE WE GET THE OTHER PART IT
20:25:44  SHOULD BE REFLECTING WHATEVER IS THE -- AT OUR
20:25:48  NEXT MEETING THAT THAT IS DOCUMENTED.
BECAUSE IT IS NOT
20:25:51  ACCURATE TO SAY THAT IT'S BEEN ADOPTED WHEN YOU HAVE ALL THESE
20:25:54  RED LINES ON THIS DOCUMENT
20:25:57 .
20:26:01 
AND ALSO THERE STILL NEEDS TO BE SOME
20:26:05  CLARIFICATION WITH MEMBER VERSUS ALTERNATE DETERMINED
20:26:08  BY THE EAST BAY COMMUNITY ENERGY BOARD WHICH WAS ALSO ADDRESSED
20:26:11  IN MY LETTER BACK ON APRIL 12th.
>> The Clerk:   THEY
20:26:14  WERE CLEAR AND IT IS ON THEIR WEBSITE AT THE EB
20:26:17 CE THAT THE FIRST, THE APPOINTEE IS THE
20:26:22  FIRST PERSON IS THE MEMBER, AND THEN THE SECOND
20:26:26  PERSON APPOINTEE IS THE ALTERNATE.
AND IT STATES THAT ON
20:26:30  THEIR WEBSITE.
AND THAT'S THE INFORMATION RECEIVED FROM
20:26:33  MR. BANKHEAD.
>> Councilmember Cox:   OKAY.
I ALSO WANT IT NOTED
20:26:36  THAT I'M THE ONLY CITY COUNCIL MEMBER THAT IS
20:26:40  NOT IN ANY APPOINT
20:26:43 EE ROLE AS A DELEGATE FOR THIS
20:26:46  CITY COUNCIL ASSIGNMENT.
I JUST WANT THAT NOTED FOR THE RECORD AS WELL.

20:26:53 >> THROUGH THE MAYOR.
>> Mayor Mei:   EXCUSE ME?
20:26:56 
>> THROUGH THE MAYOR IF I MAY.
THE COUNCIL CAN
20:26:59  APPROVE THE RESOLUTION, AND THE CHART,
20:27:02  WITH THE NOTED CORRECTIONS AND DIRECT
20:27:06  STAFF TO CORRECT THE MEETING TIMES.
IF
20:27:09  THE COUNCIL IS SO
20:27:12  INCLINED YOU CAN TAKE THAT ACTION THIS EVENING, IT DOESN'T HAVE TO COME
20:27:16  BACK.
SOME OF THOSE ARE CLERICAL IN NATURE AND WITH
20:27:19  CONFIRMATION FROM EBCE WE CAN CERTAINLY COMPLETE THE
20:27:22  CHART SO YOU CAN APPROVE THE RESOLUTION AND THE CHART SUBJECT
20:27:25  TO THOSE CHANGES AND CONFIRMATIONS THIS
EVENING.

20:27:28 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU FOR THE CLARIFICATION.
AND I THINK THAT
20:27:31  EBCE WE HAVE TO ANYWAYS PROBABLY
20:27:35  HAVE CLARIFICATION BECAUSE THERE ARE A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT THINGS
20:27:38 .
WE HAVE THERE THE EBCE BOARD
20:27:41  WHICH WE HAVE AN APPOINTEE FROM THE CITY, THERE IS THE EXECUTIVE
20:27:44  BOARD WHICH IS APPOINTED THROUGH THEIR BOARD OF DIRECTORS,
20:27:47  WHERE IT IS BY INVITATION.
AND THEN THERE'S
20:27:51  ALSO THEIR WORKING COMMITTEES WHICH PEOPLE SIGN UP FOR AND
20:27:54  THEY HAVE SPECIFIC ONES
20:27:57 , SPECIFIC ARE FINANCE, AND ON COMMUNITY  RELATED ISSUES.

20:28:00 SO THOSE ARE SEPARATE.
SO WE SHOULD PROBABLY DELINEATE
20:28:04  THOSE SEPARATELY.
20:28:07 
>> The Clerk:   DOES THE CITY COUNCIL, SORRY POINT OF ORDER.

20:28:10 DOES THE CITY COUNCIL APPOINT TO THOSE SUBCOMMITTEES
20:28:14 ?
AND AD HOC
20:28:17  COMMITTEES OR DOES THE EBCE MAKE THOSE
20:28:20   APPOINTMENTS?
>> Mayor Mei:   EBCE DOES.
>> The Clerk: 
20:28:23   I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE THOSE NOTATIONS
20:28:26 .
>> Mayor Mei:   THE ONE POINT WE MAKE ARE
20:28:30  DELEGATE MEMBER AND
20:28:34  ALTERNATE.
THE EBCE EXECUTIVE BOARD
20:28:37  IS BY APPOINTMENT FROM
20:28:41  THEIR EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR.
AND WORKING COMMITTEES AS NEEDED AND
20:28:44  THOSE ARE THROUGH THE AGAIN THE BOARD AND IN THE BEGINNING
20:28:47  USUALLY OF EVERY CALENDAR YEAR THEY ASK FOR PEOPLE TO SIGN UP
20:28:50  FOR THE WORKING COMMITTEES AND APPOINTED
TO
20:28:53  THAT.
>> The Clerk:   BUT THE CITY COUNCIL IS NOT MAKING
20:28:56  THOSE APPOINTMENTS?
>> Mayor Mei:   NO.
>> The Clerk:   THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING
20:29:00  TO --
>> Mayor Mei:   THE ONLY ONE WOULD BE THE
20:29:03  TESHT AND THE DELEGATE.
ONCE WE GET THE CLARIFICATION FROM
20:29:06  MR. BANKHEAD WE'LL BE ABLE TO DO THAT.
THANK YOU
20:29:10 .
>> Councilmember Jones:   MAYOR MEI IF YOU ARE READY FOR A MOTION.
