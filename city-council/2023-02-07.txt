ALL CHILDREN THROUGHOUT OUR CITY ARE OF 


[Captioner] 20:12:37
PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE TO FREMONT’S
FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES; AND

[Captioner] 20:12:40
 WHEREAS,
THOUSANDS OF CHILDREN ARE BORN WITH
BIRTH DEFECTS EVERY YEAR, INCLUDING

[Captioner] 20:12:45
 
APPROXIMATELY 40,000 CHILDREN (1 IN 110)


[Captioner] 20:12:51
IN THE UNITED STATES WHO
ARE BORN WITH ONE OR

[Captioner] 20:12:54
 MORE THAN
THIRTY-FIVE IDENTIFIED FORMS OF
CONGENITAL HEART DEFECTS; AND 

[Captioner] 20:12:58
WHEREAS,
CONGENITAL HEART DEFECTS ARE AMONG OUR CITY’S 


[Captioner] 20:13:03
MOST COMMON BIRTH DEFECTS AND THEY CAN
BE FATAL DUE TO THEIR

[Captioner] 20:13:07
 SERIOUSNESS, INSUFFICIENT 
EFFECTIVE MEDICAL INTERVENTION

[Captioner] 20:13:10
 OPTIONS
AND THE LIMITED AVAILABILITY OF INFANT DONOR 


[Captioner] 20:13:13
HEARTS; AND WHEREAS, THE ORIGINS AND 
SYMPTOMS OF CONGENITAL HEART DEFECTS ARE


[Captioner] 20:13:18
BECOMING MORE READILY IDENTIFIABLE AND THE 
RANGE OF SURGICAL OPTIONS ARE 

[Captioner] 20:13:25
EXPANDING
CONTINUOUSLY THANKS TO DOCTORS’ AND SCIENTISTS’ 


[Captioner] 20:13:32
DILIGENT RESEARCH EFFORTS AND FIELD
EXPERIENCES THAT EXTEND

[Captioner] 20:13:36
 OUR BODY OF
KNOWLEDGE EVERY DAY; AND WHEREAS, THERE


[Captioner] 20:13:38
IS MUCH TO LEARN ABOUT THE CAUSES OF AND 
EFFECTIVE TREATMENTS FOR CONGENITAL


[Captioner] 20:13:44
HEART DEFECTS AND IT IS IMPORTANT FOR
PARENTS, FAMILY MEMBERS, PEDIATRICIANS AND

[Captioner] 20:13:46
 
NURSES TO RECOGNIZE THE WARNING SIGNS
ASSOCIATED WITH CONGENITAL HEART 

[Captioner] 20:13:50
DEFECTS
AMONG NEWBORNS SO THEY MAY PROVIDE PROPER 


[Captioner] 20:13:54
TREATMENT AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE; AND
WHEREAS, MANY OF OUR CITY’S FAMILIES AND


[Captioner] 20:13:58
COMMUNITIES ARE DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY

[Captioner] 20:14:01
 
AFFECTED BY INFANT ILLNESS AND DEATH
CAUSED BY CONGENITAL HEART DEFECTS, 

[Captioner] 20:14:06
AND
APPLAUD THE EFFORTS OF DOCTORS AND SCIENTISTS 


[Captioner] 20:14:09
EVERYWHERE WHO WORK DILIGENTLY TO SOLVE
LIFE’S MEDICAL MYSTERIES AND TO 

[Captioner] 20:14:12
IMPROVE THE

THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED,

[Captioner] 20:14:16
 THE CITY
COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF

[Captioner] 20:14:22
 FREMONT,
RECOGNIZE FEBRUARY

[Captioner] 20:14:29

7 THROUGH 14 7-14 AS CONGENITAL HEART DEFECT 


[Captioner] 20:14:30
AWARENESS WEEK IN THE CITY OF FREMONT,
AND CALL THIS OBSERVANCE TO THE ATTENTION 


[Captioner] 20:14:36
OF ALL OUR CITIZENS.
ACCEPTING THE PROCLAMATION THIS YEAR
WILL

[Captioner] 20:14:39
 BE KHLOE HALE.
[APPLAUSE]


[Captioner] 20:14:48
>> CSD STANDS

[Captioner] 20:14:52
 FOR CONGENITAL HEART
DEFECT.
FEBRUARY 7 TO

[Captioner] 20:14:55
 THE 14 IS WHEN PEOPLE
SHARE AWARENESS LIKE I

[Captioner] 20:14:59
 AM.
FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS, I HAVE BEEN
INVITED

[Captioner] 20:15:02
 TO CITY COUNCIL MEETINGS AND
MAYOR MEI HAS PRESENTED ME WITH

[Captioner] 20:15:06
 A
 PROCLAMATION.


[Captioner] 20:15:10
THIS IS VERY EXCITING AND IMPORTANT
BECAUSE A PROCLAMATION

[Captioner] 20:15:13
 IS AN OFFICIAL
ANNOUNCEMENT FOR A MATTER OF GREAT

[Captioner] 20:15:16

IMPORTANCE.
THIS ALSO

[Captioner] 20:15:20
 HELPS RAISE AWARENESS.
1 IN 110 PEOPLE

[Captioner] 20:15:23
 ARE BORN WITH A CHD.


[Captioner] 20:15:27
WHEN A BABY IS BORN, THEIR HEART IS THE
SIZE OF A

[Captioner] 20:15:30
 WALNUT.
THAT MEANS HEART

[Captioner] 20:15:34
 SURGEONS -- I WAS ONLY
10 DAYS OLD WHEN THEY FIXED MY HEART.


[Captioner] 20:15:40
ABOUT 25% OF BABIES BORN

[Captioner] 20:15:43
 WITH A CHD ARE
CONSIDERED CRITICAL AND REQUIRE A

[Captioner] 20:15:46

LIFE-SAVING SURGERY BETWEEN BIRTH AND
THEIR FIRST BIRTHDAY.


[Captioner] 20:15:50
FOR EXAMPLE, I WAS 10 DAYS OLD AND MY

[Captioner] 20:15:53

FRIEND WAS 2 MONTHS OLD WHEN WE HAD OUR


[Captioner] 20:15:56
SURGERY.
THIS IS BECAUSE WE WERE BORN WITH

[Captioner] 20:15:59

DIFFERENT HEART DEFECTS.


[Captioner] 20:16:06
IT IS FAIR FOR -- AND THEIR FAMILIES TO

[Captioner] 20:16:09

NOT KNOW WHAT CAUSED THEIR DEFECT.
THIS IS ONE

[Captioner] 20:16:12
 REASON WHY CHD RESEARCH IS
SO IMPORTANT.


[Captioner] 20:16:15
I WANTED TO SHARE THIS SPECIAL WEEK WITH
YOU.


[Captioner] 20:16:18
I HOPE YOU ENJOYED MY

[Captioner] 20:16:22
 PRESENTATION AND
LEARNED SOMETHING NEW.
I ALSO WOULD LIKE TO SAY THANK YOU FOR

SUSIE SMITH.
>> Mayor Mei:   CAN WE

[Captioner] 20:47:18

[Captioner] 20:47:22

>> The Clerk:   SUSIE SMITH.


[Captioner] 20:47:29
PLEASE UNMUTE.


[Captioner] 20:47:45
MS. SMITH ISN'T COMING THROUGH.
SHE NEEDS TO

[Captioner] 20:47:48
 MUTE ON HER END.
>> Mayor Mei:   OKAY

[Captioner] 20:47:52
.

[Captioner] 20:48:09

WE CAN'T UNMUTE FOR HER.
>> The Clerk:   HAS

[Captioner] 20:48:12
 TO BE DONE 
AT HER END.

[Captioner] 20:48:15

>> Mayor Mei:   AT THIS TIME 
WE'RE GOING TO COME BACK

[Captioner] 20:48:18
 TO THE 
ITEMS THAT WERE PULLED ON THE 
CONSENT CALENDAR

[Captioner] 20:48:22
.
2E AS IN EL

[Captioner] 20:48:25
 SPHANT.
THE PROTECTED INTERSECTION AT 
FREMONT AND

[Captioner] 20:48:29
 WALNUT.
AND I THINK THAT WAS JOHN HINES.


[Captioner] 20:48:48
TWO IS 79.
JOHN.

[Captioner] 20:48:51

>> GREAT TO BE HERE AGAIN.
>> Mayor Mei:   NICE TO SEE YOU

[Captioner] 20:48:54
 
TOGETHER.
>> ITEMS E AND F TOGETHER ARE

[Captioner] 20:48:57
 $5 
MILLION, THAT IS JUST SOMEONE 
ELSE'S MIND OF COURSE

[Captioner] 20:49:01
 BUT STILL 
THE AMOUNT GIVES US AN IDEA OF

[Captioner] 20:49:05
 
HOW MUCH SHOULD BE APPLIED TO 
INTERSECTIONS.

[Captioner] 20:49:10

AND WORTH ASKING IS THAT CHANGE 
GOING TO BE IMPROVEMENT

[Captioner] 20:49:13
 OR IS IT 
GOING TO BE

[Captioner] 20:49:17
 (INAUDIBLE) SOME 
LESS SO

[Captioner] 20:49:21
.
(INAUDIBLE) I ASKED

[Captioner] 20:49:24
 THIS BECAUSE 
I CAN THINK OF AT LEAST TWO 
INTERSECTION

[Captioner] 20:49:28
S OF FREMONT THAT 
HAVE NOT WORKED OUT, SO

[Captioner] 20:49:31
 FREMONT 
BOULEVARD AND MOWRY, WHERE 
TRAFFIC ON

[Captioner] 20:49:34
 TREATMENT BACKS UP SO 
BADLY SOMETIMES THAT SOME

[Captioner] 20:49:38
 OF THE 
DRIVEWAY (INAUDIBLE) AND THE 
SECOND ONE I'M THINKING OF

[Captioner] 20:49:41
 IS 
OSGOOD AND WASHINGTON.
SO THESE ARE

[Captioner] 20:49:46
 NOT (INAUDIBLE) IF 
WE KEEP

[Captioner] 20:49:50
 PROPOSING THESE PEACE 
MEAL ON THE CONSENT CALENDAR

[Captioner] 20:49:54
, 
(INAUDIBLE) BRAVO

[Captioner] 20:49:58
 APPROVING THE 
FUNDING, WE WILL

[Captioner] 20:50:01
 OVER TIME 
(INAUDIBLE) NO ONE REALLY ASKED 
FOR SO

[Captioner] 20:50:04
 IT WILL BE A GOOD TIME I 
THINK INSTEAD OF

[Captioner] 20:50:08
 CONSIDERING BY 
LOCATION, CONSIDER THEM

[Captioner] 20:50:12
 BY KIND 
(INAUDIBLE) IF WE COULD REQUEST 
OR

[Captioner] 20:50:15
 VIEW KINDS OF INTERSECTION 
CHANGES SO THE COUNCIL LOOK AT A

[Captioner] 20:50:18
 
CHANGE TO

[Captioner] 20:50:34
 CATEGORIZE.


[Captioner] 20:50:37
STAFF TO WELCOME (INAUDIBLE) THE 
ALTERNATIVE IS

[Captioner] 20:50:42
 JUST SET BACK AND 
WAIT FOR THE ANGRY

[Captioner] 20:50:45
 COMPLAINTS.
SO I STRONGLY SUGGEST A REVIEW 
OF

[Captioner] 20:50:48
 CATEGORIES OF CHANGE.
THANK YOU

[Captioner] 20:50:53
.

[Captioner] 20:51:01

>> Mayor Mei:   ALSO ITEM 2F.
YOU ALSO HAVE TWO

[Captioner] 20:51:03
 MINUTES FOR 
THAT.
OKAY.


[Captioner] 20:51:10
WE HAVE TO TAKE THESE SEPARATELY 
FOR A VOTE OR CAN WE

[Captioner] 20:51:13
 COMBINE 
THEM?
IF THE CITY ATTORNEY

[Captioner] 20:51:17
 --
>> SINCE THEY ARE NO LONGER PART 
OF THE LARGE

[Captioner] 20:51:21
ER CONSENT CALENDAR 
IT IS BETTER TO DO THEM 
INDIVIDUALLY.

[Captioner] 20:51:24

>> Mayor Mei:   THAT IS WHAT I 
WAS GOING TO SAY SO WE'LL DO 


[Captioner] 20:51:27
THEM SEPARATELY.
ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS OR 
COMMENTS?


[Captioner] 20:51:30
I SEE COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL YOU 
HAVE

[Captioner] 20:51:33
 YOUR HANDLED RAISED.
>> Councilmember Campbell:   
THANK YOU,

[Captioner] 20:51:36
 MAYOR MEI.
I WAS ABLE TO ASK SEVERAL 
QUESTIONS ABOUT BOTH OF

[Captioner] 20:51:40
 THESE 
ITEMS PRIOR TO OUR MEETING THIS 
EVENING BECAUSE I

[Captioner] 20:51:43
 SHARED SIMILAR 
CONCERNS OF HEARING

[Captioner] 20:51:46
 MANY 
COMMUNITY MEMBERS CONCERNED 
ABOUT

[Captioner] 20:51:50
 THE CURRENT STATE OF SOME 
OF OUR INTERSECTIONS.
AND I

[Captioner] 20:51:53
 JUST WANTED TO

[Captioner] 20:51:57
 BE SURE 
THAT THIS PROJECT WOULD BE MAYBE 
A

[Captioner] 20:52:00
 LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT

[Captioner] 20:52:02
 FROM THE 
ONES THAT WE HAVE CURRENTLY 
DONE.


[Captioner] 20:52:05
AND I DON'T KNOW IF MR. LARSON 
IS HERE RIGHT NOW

[Captioner] 20:52:09
.
>> Mayor Mei:   HE IS, I WAS 
GOING TO ASK MR. LARSON

[Captioner] 20:52:12
 IF YOU 
WOULD BE SO KIND AS TO EITHER

[Captioner] 20:52:16
 
APPROACH THE -- HE IS HERE

[Captioner] 20:52:20
.
>> Councilmember Campbell:   HE 
WAS KIND ENOUGH TO ANSWER 


[Captioner] 20:52:23
SEVERAL OF MY QUESTIONS ABOUT 
THE INTERSECTIONS.
SO WOULD YOU BE ABLE TO SHARE 


[Captioner] 20:52:26
WITH US WHETHER THESE 
INTERSECTIONS ARE GOING TO BE 
SIMILAR TO THE

[Captioner] 20:52:30
 ONES THAT JOHN, I

[Captioner] 20:52:33
 
FORGOT HIS LAST NAME --

[Captioner] 20:52:37

>> Mayor Mei:   HINES.

[Captioner] 20:52:40

>> Councilmember Campbell:   
MR. HINES JUST SPOKE ABOUT.


[Captioner] 20:52:43
>> Hans Larsen:   YES, 
COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL I'M

[Captioner] 20:52:46
 HAPPY 
TO ANSWER THAT.
I THINK WE -- SO

[Captioner] 20:52:49
 THESE TWO 
CONTRACTS THAT ARE ON THE 
COUNCIL AGENDA

[Captioner] 20:52:53
 WOULD CONTINUE 
CONSTRUCTING, A TYPE

[Captioner] 20:52:56
 OF 
INTERSECTION IMPROVEMENT THAT'S 
CALLED A PROTECTED

[Captioner] 20:52:59
 INTERSECTION.
THESE,

[Captioner] 20:53:02
 WE CURRENTLY HAVE 13 OF 
THESE THAT HAVE BEEN CONSTRUCTED 
IN

[Captioner] 20:53:05
 DIFFERENTLY PARTS OF THE 
CITY.
GENERALLY

[Captioner] 20:53:09
, THEY'RE LOCATED 
AROUND OUR MAJOR

[Captioner] 20:53:12
 TRANSIT CENTERS 
AND IN AREAS WHERE THE CITY IS

[Captioner] 20:53:15
 
PLANNING INFILL URBAN 
DEVELOPMENT.


[Captioner] 20:53:18
SO IT'S A

[Captioner] 20:53:22
 TRANSFORMATION OF 
WHAT'S

[Captioner] 20:53:25
 HISTORICALLY BEEN AN 
INTERSECTION DESIGN 50

[Captioner] 20:53:28
 YEARS 
AGO, WAS ORIENTED AROUND MOVING

[Captioner] 20:53:31
 
CARS FAST AND DIDN'T PROVIDE 
BALANCED ACCOMMODATIONS

[Captioner] 20:53:35
 FOR 
PEOPLE WHO WERE WALKING OR 
BIKING OR WHEELCHAIR.


[Captioner] 20:53:38
THIS IS PART OF THE CITY'S 
COMPLETE STREETS POLICY TO BUILD

[Captioner] 20:53:41
 
THEIR STREETS AND INTERSECTION 
IS THAT ARE SAFE AND CONVENIENT 


[Captioner] 20:53:44
FOR EVERYBODY.
SO IN SOME WAYS IT'S SIMILAR TO 
THOSE

[Captioner] 20:53:47
.
WE DO HAVE MANY OF THEM, WE

[Captioner] 20:53:50
 HAVE 
FOUR OF THEM ALONG THE

[Captioner] 20:53:55
 WALNUT 
AVENUE CORRIDOR SO THESE WOULD 
BE

[Captioner] 20:53:58
 SIMILAR TO THOSE.
ONE OF THE KEY FEATURES THERE 
THAT

[Captioner] 20:54:01
 ADMITTEDLY HAS BEEN 
CONTROVERSIAL IS THAT WE'RE

[Captioner] 20:54:04
 
TIGHTENING THE INTERSECTION AND 
REMOVING

[Captioner] 20:54:07
 THE HIGH-SPEED 
RIGHT-TURN

[Captioner] 20:54:10
 LANES WHICH HAVE BEEN 
A SOURCE OF UNFORTUNATELY

[Captioner] 20:54:14
 A 
TRAFFIC INJURIES IN OUR 
COMMUNITY AND SO THIS

[Captioner] 20:54:17
 SLOWS DOWN 
THE VEHICLE TRAFFIC AND CREATES 
A BETTER

[Captioner] 20:54:20
 ENVIRONMENT FOR PEOPLE 
THAT ARE WALKING, AND AGAIN,

[Captioner] 20:54:23
 
THEY'RE TARGETED IN AREAS WHERE 
WE HAVE MORE TRANSIT ACTIVITY

[Captioner] 20:54:27
, 
INFILL DEVELOPMENT, HIGHER 
DENSITY DEVELOPMENT WHERE

[Captioner] 20:54:30
 WE 
EXPECT MORE PEOPLE TO WALK AND 
BIKE

[Captioner] 20:54:33
.
LET ME KIND OF SPEAK TO 
MR. HINES

[Captioner] 20:54:36
' INTEREST AND WE 
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE HAVE BEEN 
EXPERIMENT

[Captioner] 20:54:39
ING AND DOING A LOT OF 
THINGS IN FREMONT WITH PAINT AND 
PLASTIC

[Captioner] 20:54:43
 AND CONCRETE.
WE

[Captioner] 20:54:47
 ARE -- THE WORK THAT WE'VE 
DONE HAS BEEN BASED ON

[Captioner] 20:54:50
 SORT OF 
PAST PLANS AND

[Captioner] 20:54:54
 POLICIES THAT THE 
COUNCIL HAS ADOPTED.
EVERY FIVE YEARS

[Captioner] 20:54:57
 WE DO A NEW 
PEDESTRIAN PLAN, A

[Captioner] 20:55:00
 NEW BICYCLE 
PLAN AND WE ARE GOING

[Captioner] 20:55:03
 TO BE 
EMBARKING ON CREATING A NEW 
UPDATE

[Captioner] 20:55:07
ED BICYCLE AND PEDESTRIAN 
MASTER PLAN

[Captioner] 20:55:09
.
WE'LL COMBINE THEM TOGETHER IN 
WHAT WE CALL AN

[Captioner] 20:55:12
 ACTIVE 
TRANSPORTATION PLAN.
AND WE ARE VERY INTERESTED

[Captioner] 20:55:15
 IN 
ENGAGING DEEPLY WITH THE 
COMMUNITY

[Captioner] 20:55:18
 TO ASSESS WHAT WE'VE 
DONE SO FAR.
IS THIS THE

[Captioner] 20:55:22
 RIGHT DIRECTION TO 
TAKE, WHERE ARE THE RIGHT PLACES

[Captioner] 20:55:25
 
AND PRIORITIES FOR THIS OR OTHER 
TYPES OF INVESTMENT

[Captioner] 20:55:28
, AND SO 
WE'LL BE LAUNCHING THIS PROGRAM 
BEGINNING

[Captioner] 20:55:31
 THIS SPRING THROUGH 
THE SUMMER AND FALL.
AND THEN COME BACK

[Captioner] 20:55:35
 TO COUNCIL 
ABOUT A YEAR FROM NOW, WITH SORT 
OF A

[Captioner] 20:55:38
 NEW, IMPROVED, UPDATED PLAN 
THAT

[Captioner] 20:55:41
 IS REFLECTIVE OF THE INPUT 
FROM THE COMMUNITY.


[Captioner] 20:55:44
AND SO AS WE GO FORWARD WITH 
THIS KIND OF WORK WE'LL HAVE THE

[Captioner] 20:55:47
 
BENEFIT OF PAST EXPERIENCE AND 
THINGS THAT WE'VE DONE, WHAT'S

[Captioner] 20:55:51
 
WORKED, WHAT HASN'T AND THAT 
WILL GUIDE SORT OF THE NEXT

[Captioner] 20:55:54
 FIVE 
YEARS OF WORK THAT WE DO IN THIS

[Captioner] 20:55:57
 
GENERAL DIRECTION OF SUPPORTING 
PEOPLE WHO WALK AND BIKE.


[Captioner] 20:56:00
SO HOPEFULLY THAT'S HELPFUL.
>> Councilmember Campbell:   
THAT'S VERY

[Captioner] 20:56:03
 HELPFUL.
ONE OF THE OTHER QUESTIONS THAT 
I HAD, MR. 

[Captioner] 20:56:06
LARSON, WAS THE 
FUNDING FOR THIS

[Captioner] 20:56:09
.
I UNDERSTAND THAT MOST OF THE 
MONEY,

[Captioner] 20:56:12
 THE MAJORITY OF THE 
MONEY, IS COMING FROM A GRANT 
THAT WE

[Captioner] 20:56:15
 RECEIVED.
AND THEN WE HAVE TO FILL IN THE 
GAP

[Captioner] 20:56:18
 WITH SOME ADDITIONAL 
FUNDING.
AND I WANTED TO ENSURE

[Captioner] 20:56:21
 THAT THE 
GAP FUNDING THAT WE HAVE

[Captioner] 20:56:25
 IS TO 
DO THIS PROJECT WOULD NOT IMPACT 
ANY

[Captioner] 20:56:28
 FUTURE PROJECTS THAT 
SOMETHING HAS TO COME OFF

[Captioner] 20:56:31
 THE 
TABLE IF YOU'RE PUTTING MONEY ON 
THE TABLE

[Captioner] 20:56:35
 FOR THESE PROJECTS.
>> Hans Larsen:   YES,

[Captioner] 20:56:37
 SO THAT'S 
CORRECT.
JUST TO ADD A LITTLE BIT OF 


[Captioner] 20:56:41
BACKGROUND ON IT, SO THESE 
PROJECTS ARE BOTH

[Captioner] 20:56:44
 FUNDED WITH 
FEDERAL GRANTS THAT WE'RE

[Captioner] 20:56:47
 
RECEIVING THAT HAVE BOTH BEEN 
ENDORSED BY

[Captioner] 20:56:51
 THE ALAMEDA COUNTY 
TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION, THE

[Captioner] 20:56:54
 
METROPOLITAN TRANSPORTATION 
COMMISSION AND THE GRANT FUNDING 


[Captioner] 20:56:58
WAS ACCEPTED BY COUNCIL LAST I 
BELIEVE IT WAS IN MAY

[Captioner] 20:57:01
.
AND SO THESE GRANTS REQUIRE SOME 
LOCAL

[Captioner] 20:57:04
 FUNDING AS A MATCH.

[Captioner] 20:57:07

UNFORTUNATELY

[Captioner] 20:57:11
 WE'RE IN A 
SITUATION WHERE COSTS HAVE GONE 
UP.

[Captioner] 20:57:14

THE GRANT DOLLARS ARE FIXED

[Captioner] 20:57:17
 SO 
WE'VE HAD TO ADD SOME MORE CITY 
MONEY TO DO THESE.

[Captioner] 20:57:20

BUT AS PART OF THE COMMITMENT IN 
THE FEDERAL AGREEMENTS THAT WE 


[Captioner] 20:57:24
FULLY FUND THESE PROJECTS AND 
DELIVER THEM WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO 
TAKE

[Captioner] 20:57:27
 MONEY FROM OTHER PROJECTS 
THAT WE'VE COMPLETED THAT HAVE 
EXTRA

[Captioner] 20:57:30
 MONEY.
SO WE'VE MOVED IT INTO HERE AND 
IN ONE

[Captioner] 20:57:33
 CASE THERE'S A PROJECT 
THAT'S ON

[Captioner] 20:57:37
 FREMONT AND COUNTRY

[Captioner] 20:57:40
.
WHICH IS ALSO A PROTECT

[Captioner] 20:57:44
ED 
INTERSECTION AND WHICH COUNCIL 
HAS ACCEPTED A FEDERAL

[Captioner] 20:57:47
 GRANT 
FOR.
WE ARE TAKING SOME OF THE LOCAL

[Captioner] 20:57:50
 
MATCHING FUNDS FROM THAT IN 
ORDER TO COVER THE HIGHER COSTS

[Captioner] 20:57:53
 
ON THIS PROJECT BUT WE HAVE 
DISCUSSED

[Captioner] 20:57:57
 WITH ALAMEDA CTC

[Captioner] 20:58:00
 ABOUT 
THE ISSUE OF RISING CONSTRUCTION 
COSTS AND WE'RE WORKING

[Captioner] 20:58:03
 WITH 
THEM THROUGH THEIR BUDGET 
PROCESS AND HAVE A COMMITMENT

[Captioner] 20:58:06
 
FROM THEIR STAFF TO RESTORE 
MONEY TO THAT PROJECT SO THAT 


[Captioner] 20:58:09
EVERYTHING IS WHOLE.

[Captioner] 20:58:24

>> Councilmember Campbell:   
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:58:27
>> Mayor Mei:   ARE THERE ANY 
OTHER QUESTIONS FROM YOU?
NEXT

[Captioner] 20:58:30
 IS COUNCILMEMBER SHAO.
>> Councilmember Shao:   THANK 
YOU, MADAM

[Captioner] 20:58:34
 MAYOR.
I'M VERY GLAD THAT

[Captioner] 20:58:37
 THE CHANGES 
WERE AN EXPERIMENT.
AS

[Captioner] 20:58:41
 A SCIENTIST I LIKE TO DO AN 
EXPERIMENT AND LIKE TO

[Captioner] 20:58:44
 COLLECT 
DATA FROM THE EXPERIMENT.
AND

[Captioner] 20:58:47
 I'M GLAD STARTING THIS YEAR 
WE WILL COLLECT DATA, OUT

[Captioner] 20:58:50
REACH 
TO THE PEOPLE, TAKE FEEDBACKS 
AND I WANT

[Captioner] 20:58:53
 TO BE ONE OF THE 
PEOPLE THAT YOU APPROACH TO GIVE 
MY FEEDBACK

[Captioner] 20:58:56
.
I LIVE VERY CLOSE TO

[Captioner] 20:59:00
 THE OSGOOD 
AND

[Captioner] 20:59:04
 WASHINGTON INTERSECTION, AND 
I HEARD MANY NEGATIVE

[Captioner] 20:59:08
 FEEDBACKS 
FROM MY NEIGHBORS AND MY OWN

[Captioner] 20:59:11
 
OBSERVATION, ALSO COME FROM 
THAT.


[Captioner] 20:59:14
SO IF

[Captioner] 20:59:18
 THIS IS AN EXPERIMENT AND 
I THINK FIRST OF ALL,

[Captioner] 20:59:21
 IT 
DESERVES SOME PATIENCE, FOR US 
TO

[Captioner] 20:59:25
 GATHER SOME DATA, DO

[Captioner] 20:59:28
 
ANALYSIS, ASSESSMENT BEFORE WE 
MAKE MORE COMMITMENT

[Captioner] 20:59:31
 TO MORE OF 
SUCH CHANGES.
ESPECIALLY

[Captioner] 20:59:35
 ONE NOW WE HAVE TO 
TAKE MONEY OUT OF OUR POCKET

[Captioner] 20:59:38
.
SO IF WE SPEND MONEY AND

[Captioner] 20:59:41
 STILL 
GET A LOT OF

[Captioner] 20:59:46
 THE UNEXPECTED

[Captioner] 20:59:55
 OR 
UNINTENDED ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES 
IT IS A LOOSE

[Captioner] 20:59:58
 SITUATION.
SO MY COMMENT IS,

[Captioner] 21:00:02
 WHY HURRY, 
LET'S JUST SLOW DOWN,

[Captioner] 21:00:05
 COLLECT 
DATA, COMPARE DATA OF CASUALTY 
ON THOSE

[Captioner] 21:00:08
 SO-CALLED PROTECTED 
INTERSECTIONS, BEFORE AND

[Captioner] 21:00:12
 AFTER 
THE PROJECT, AND THEN, ALSO

[Captioner] 21:00:15
, 
COLLECT FEEDBACK FROM THE

[Captioner] 21:00:18
 
NEIGHBORHOOD.
SO THAT WE CAN HAVE AN IDEA 


[Captioner] 21:00:21
WHETHER WE ARE IN THE RIGHT 
DIRECTION OR WE ARE IN THE WRONG 
DIRECTION

[Captioner] 21:00:26
.
SO THAT'S ALL THE EXPERIMENTAL

[Captioner] 21:00:31
 
PROCESS OF PHASE IS ABOUT.
LET'S FINISH THE

[Captioner] 21:00:35
 EXPERIMENTAL 
PHASE BEFORE FURTHER COMMITMENT.
THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO

[Captioner] 21:00:37
 SAY.
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU, 
COUNCILMEMBER SHAO.


[Captioner] 21:00:40
NEXT IS COUNCILMEMBER COX

[Captioner] 21:00:43
.
>> Councilmember Cox:   THANK 
YOU

[Captioner] 21:00:47
.
HANS LARSEN

[Captioner] 21:00:51
 FOR YOUR REPORT.
I WANTED TO FIND OUT FOR

[Captioner] 21:00:54
 THE 
MATERIAL GRANTS IS IT SOMETHING 
THAT IF YOU COULD GIVE ME A

[Captioner] 21:00:57
 TIME 
FRAME OF HOW LONG IT IS ACTIVE 
TO USE

[Captioner] 21:01:00
 THESE GRANTS, SO WE CAN 
UNDERSTAND IF THERE'S SOME OTHER

[Captioner] 21:01:04
 
STUDIES OR THINGS OR DATA THAT 
WE NEED TO GATHER, SO

[Captioner] 21:01:07
 THE FUNDS 
WOULD NOT EXPIRE

[Captioner] 21:01:11
?

[Captioner] 21:01:18

>> Hans Larsen:   SO FOR THESE 
PARTICULAR PROJECTS THAT WE 


[Captioner] 21:01:22
HAVE, THESE WERE ACTUALLY -- SO 
THEY NEED TO BE USED NOW.


[Captioner] 21:01:25
AND THERE'S A TIMELY USE OF 
FUNDS COMMITMENT

[Captioner] 21:01:28
 THAT WE MADE IN 
RECEIVING THESE FUNDS.
AND THEY

[Captioner] 21:01:31
 WERE ACTUALLY, THE 
PROGRAM THAT MTC HAS WAS --

[Captioner] 21:01:34
 IS 
CALLED SOMETHING LIKE PROJECT 
QUICK STRIKE

[Captioner] 21:01:37
.
AND MAYBE THIS IS MORE 
INFORMATION THAT YOU NEED, SO 


[Captioner] 21:01:40
THESE ARE KIND OF OLD FEDERAL 
MONEYS THAT I

[Captioner] 21:01:43
 THINK BECAME 
AVAILABLE BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T 
SPENT FROM OTHER PROGRAMS

[Captioner] 21:01:48
.
AND MTC AND ALAMEDA

[Captioner] 21:01:51
 CTC WE PRIDE 
OURSELVES IF ANYBODY ELSE IN THE 
COUNTRY OR

[Captioner] 21:01:54
 THE AREA HAS UNUSED 
FEDERAL FUNDS WE CAN USE

[Captioner] 21:01:57
 THEM 
WITHIN THE BAY AREA.
SO THESE FUNDS THAT WE

[Captioner] 21:02:00
 RECEIVED 
WERE PART OF THAT.
AND THEY REQUIRED A

[Captioner] 21:02:04
 COMMITMENT 
TO BE ABLE TO DELIVER THEM FAST,

[Captioner] 21:02:07
 
FOR PROJECTS THAT WERE DEEMED TO 
BE VALUABLE

[Captioner] 21:02:10
 IN ALIGNMENT WITH 
THE BAY AREA AND THE COUNTY'S

[Captioner] 21:02:14
 
TRANSPORTATION GOALS AS WELL AS 
OURS.


[Captioner] 21:02:17
SO THERE IS NOT AN OPPORTUNITY 
TO SAY, YOU KNOW,

[Captioner] 21:02:20
 LET'S WAIT A 
YEAR OR TWO

[Captioner] 21:02:23
 WITH THIS.
SO THERE IS A COMMITMENT THAT WE 
USE

[Captioner] 21:02:27
 THESE NOW.
AND WE'RE OBLIGATED TO GET THE

[Captioner] 21:02:30
 
PROJECT INTO CONSTRUCTION 
LITERALLY LIKE THIS

[Captioner] 21:02:33
 MONTH.
>> Councilmember Cox:   WOW.

[Captioner] 21:02:37

SO THEN WHEN IS THE END DATE OF 
THE FUNDS IF YOU DON'T

[Captioner] 21:02:39
 --
>> Hans Larsen:   SO THE 
COMMITMENT IS TO BE ABLE TO 


[Captioner] 21:02:43
AWARD A CONTRACT TO GET IT INTO 
CONSTRUCTION

[Captioner] 21:02:46
.
AND THEN, YOU KNOW, IT IS UP TO 
US AND

[Captioner] 21:02:49
 THE CONTRACTOR IN TERMS 
OF WHAT THE COMPLETION DATE

[Captioner] 21:02:52
 IS.
BUT, YOU KNOW, TO AWARD THE 
CONTRACT

[Captioner] 21:02:55
 IS BASICALLY THE 
MILESTONE THAT IS

[Captioner] 21:02:58
 LOOKED AT IN 
TERMS OF TIMELY USE OF FUNDS.

[Captioner] 21:03:01

THERE ARE DIFFERENT KIND OF 
PROGRAMS OUT THERE, SOME OF THEM 


[Captioner] 21:03:04
HAVE MORE TIME THAN LESS BUT 
THIS PARTICULAR --

[Captioner] 21:03:07
 FOR BOTH OF 
THESE PROJECTS, THE FUNDING FOR 
THIS

[Captioner] 21:03:11
 WAS SOMETHING THAT HAS KIND 
OF A VERY QUICK TURN AROUND

[Captioner] 21:03:14
 
TIME.
>> Councilmember Cox:   SO

[Captioner] 21:03:17
 IT 
HAS TO BE COMMITTED BY THE END 
OF THIS MONTH

[Captioner] 21:03:20
?
>> Hans Larsen:   IT -- THAT IS 
COMMITMENT WE MADE IN RECEIVING 


[Captioner] 21:03:23
THESE FUNDS, YES.
>> Councilmember Cox:   OKAY, 
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 21:03:26
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.
NEXT IS COUNCILMEMBER KENG.


[Captioner] 21:03:30
>> Vice Mayor Keng:   THANK YOU, 
YES, SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH, 
HANS

[Captioner] 21:03:33
, FOR YOUR UPDATE AND

[Captioner] 21:03:36
 
CLARIFICATION.
AND I THINK PROBABLY THE NUMBER 


[Captioner] 21:03:39
1 QUESTION THAT I GET WHEN I'M 
AT, YOU KNOW,

[Captioner] 21:03:43
 COMMUNITY EVENTS 
LIKE SUMMER CONCERTS OR OTHER 
EVENTS

[Captioner] 21:03:46
, IS, YOU KNOW, WHY ARE WE 
MAKING

[Captioner] 21:03:49
 THIS STREETS SUCH AS 
FREMONT, MOWRY

[Captioner] 21:03:53
, THOSE CHANGES 
THAT PEOPLE DON'T REALLY SEE

[Captioner] 21:03:56
 THE 
BENEFITS OF.
AND THEY FEEL LIKE IT JUST

[Captioner] 21:03:59
 ADDS 
TO, YOU KNOW, IT'S MORE IN

[Captioner] 21:04:02

INCONVENIENCE THAN OTHER THINGS.

[Captioner] 21:04:05

AND I WOULD LIKE TO SEE, YOU 
KNOW, MORE DATA

[Captioner] 21:04:09
 AND ANALYSIS 
FROM THE STREETS THAT WE HAVE

[Captioner] 21:04:12
 
DONE.
AND I'M ALL FOR MAKING OUR

[Captioner] 21:04:15
 
STREETS SAFER FOR ALL MODES, ALL 
USE

[Captioner] 21:04:18
ERS BUT I THINK WE REALLY 
SHOULD TAKE A LOOK AT, YOU KNOW,

[Captioner] 21:04:22
 
THE STREETS THAT HAVE BEEN 
CHANGED, AND

[Captioner] 21:04:25
 TO SEE, YOU KNOW, 
WHETHER THEY'VE REALLY

[Captioner] 21:04:27
 BENEFIT 
OUR COMMUNITY.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 21:04:32
>> Hans Larsen:   YES, LET ME 
JUST COMMENT

[Captioner] 21:04:36
 QUICKLY ON THAT 
MANY I APPRECIATE THAT.
WE HAVE SEVERAL

[Captioner] 21:04:39
 OF THESE TYPES 
OF INTERSECTIONS ON FREMONT

[Captioner] 21:04:42
 
BOULEVARD.
WE ALSO HAVE IN CONSTRUCTION 


[Captioner] 21:04:45
RIGHT NOW A TRAFFIC SIGNAL 
MODERNIZATION PROGRAM

[Captioner] 21:04:48
 ON FREMONT 
BOULEVARD THAT'S COVERING ALMOST 
40

[Captioner] 21:04:52
 INTERSECTION FROM ARDENWOOD 
TO SOUTH FREMONT.
WE

[Captioner] 21:04:55
 ALSO RECEIVED A GRANT FROM 
THE

[Captioner] 21:04:58
 ALAMEDA COUNTY 
TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION TO 
LOOK

[Captioner] 21:05:02
 AT INNOVATIVE USE OF NEW 
TECHNOLOGIES TO

[Captioner] 21:05:06
 ENHANCE TRAFFIC 
FLOW AND SIGNALS.
AND SO ONE

[Captioner] 21:05:09
 OF THE BENEFITS WE 
EXPECT TO SEE THAT AREN'T THERE 
YET, WE

[Captioner] 21:05:13
 RECOGNIZE WE'VE SLOWED 
DOWN TRAFFIC, TO MAKE

[Captioner] 21:05:16
 IT SAFER 
FOR PEDESTRIANS AND BICYCLISTS

[Captioner] 21:05:20
, 
BUT WE ARE EQUALLY COMMITTED TO 
MAKING OUR

[Captioner] 21:05:23
 SIGNAL SYSTEM MOVE 
TRAFFIC AT A SAFE

[Captioner] 21:05:26
 SPEED BUT 
EFFICIENTLY.
SO WE'LL BE SEEING KIND OF

[Captioner] 21:05:29
 THE 
LAYERING EFFECT OF THE COMPLETE 
STREET IMPROVEMENTS

[Captioner] 21:05:32
 PLUS THE 
SIGNAL MODERNIZATION LATER THIS

[Captioner] 21:05:36
 
YEAR.
AND I AGREE WITH THE

[Captioner] 21:05:39
 POINTS THAT 
HAVE BEEN MADE, KIND OF AN 
OPPORTUNITY OF

[Captioner] 21:05:42
 BEING INNOVATIVE 
AND EXPERIMENTING, LET'S SEE HOW 
IT WORKS AND

[Captioner] 21:05:45
 THEN WHEN WE DO OUR 
NEW PLAN WE CAN FIGURE OUT WHERE 
WE WANT

[Captioner] 21:05:48
 TO GO INTO THE FUTURE.
SO APPRECIATE THAT, WE

[Captioner] 21:05:52
 
RECOGNIZE, YOU KNOW, THERE ARE 
PEOPLE THAT DRIVE.


[Captioner] 21:05:55
IT'S A DIFFERENT EXPERIMENT -- 
EXPERIENCE BUT

[Captioner] 21:05:58
 THERE ARE SOME 
THINGS THAT ARE COMING THAT WILL 
HELP THEM

[Captioner] 21:06:01
.
>> Vice Mayor Keng:   THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU

[Captioner] 21:06:05
.
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN.


[Captioner] 21:06:09
>> Councilmember Kassan:   MY 
QUESTION WAS ANSWERED, THANK 
YOU.


[Captioner] 21:06:12
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.
COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL

[Captioner] 21:06:14
.
>> Councilmember Campbell:   MY 
QUESTION WAS ANSWERED, TOO.


[Captioner] 21:06:17
BUT I DID WANT TO ADD THAT I AM 
DEFINITELY

[Captioner] 21:06:20
 INTERESTED IN 
ENSURING THE SAFETY OF

[Captioner] 21:06:24
 
PEDESTRIANS AND BICYCLE

[Captioner] 21:06:27
ERS AND 
PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT IN VEHICLES

[Captioner] 21:06:30
, 
MOTOR SIGNINGERS

[Captioner] 21:06:35
, SCOOTERS THAT 
LOOK LIKE MOTOR SCAMS

[Captioner] 21:06:38
 NOWADAYS, 
I'M DEFINITELY IN FAVOR OF THAT 
BUT I

[Captioner] 21:06:41
 WOULD DEFINITELY AGREE 
THAT WE

[Captioner] 21:06:44
 SHOULD RECALIBRATE WHAT 
WE'VE ALREADY DONE,

[Captioner] 21:06:47
 SEE WHAT'S 
WORKING AND SEE WHAT'S NOT 
WORKING.


[Captioner] 21:06:50
THANK YOU FOR THIS REPORT AND 
THE DETAILED EXPLANATION.


[Captioner] 21:06:55
>> Mayor Mei:   SO COUNCILMEMBER 
SALWAN.


[Captioner] 21:06:58
>> Councilmember Salwan:   SURE.
THANK YOU MADAM MAYOR.
YES

[Captioner] 21:07:02
, IT WAS KIND OF HARD TO KIND 
OF VISUALIZE SOME

[Captioner] 21:07:05
 OF THESE, DO 
WE HAVE ANY SKETCHES OR HOW IT'S 
GOING TO

[Captioner] 21:07:08
 LOOK AT THESE 
INTERSECTIONS AS FAR AS THE 
CHANGES WE'RE MAKING

[Captioner] 21:07:11
?
>> Hans Larsen:   I WOULD SAY 
PROBABLY KIND OF THE BEST 


[Captioner] 21:07:14
EXAMPLE THAT IS SORT OF SIMILAR 
TO THE WALL NET AND

[Captioner] 21:07:18
 THE PASEO 
PADRE INTERSECTION,

[Captioner] 21:07:21
 SO TIGHTENED 
CORNERS, WE'RE NOT

[Captioner] 21:07:24
 TAKING AWAY 
ANY LANES, IN FACT AT THESE 
INTERSECTIONS,

[Captioner] 21:07:27
 THERE WILL BE A 
RIGHT-TURN

[Captioner] 21:07:31
 LANE.
AS OPPOSED TO A SHARED THROUGH-

[Captioner] 21:07:34

THROUGH-RIGHT.
SO PARTICULARLY

[Captioner] 21:07:37
 AT GRIMMER AND 
FREMONT, SORT OF THE CAPACITY

[Captioner] 21:07:40
 OF 
THE INTERSECTION AND THE SAME 
THING AT FREMONT-

[Captioner] 21:07:44
WALNUT.
SO I THINK

[Captioner] 21:07:47
 PASEO WALL

[Captioner] 21:07:50
 NUT IS THE 
BEST EXAMPLE SIMILAR TO -- AND 
THESE ARE

[Captioner] 21:07:54
 NATIONALLY APPROVED 
STANDARD DESIGNS.
THERE'S NOT

[Captioner] 21:07:57
 A LOT OF THEM 
AROUND.
YOU KNOW, WE'RE A BIT MORE 


[Captioner] 21:08:00
ADVANCED THAN OTHER COMMUNITIES.
BUT ACROSS THE COUNTRY THESE 
TYPES

[Captioner] 21:08:03
 OF THINGS ARE BEING BUILT.
BUT SO, AS

[Captioner] 21:08:07
, YOU KNOW, 
FREMONT-WALNUT IS PROBABLY THE 
BEST

[Captioner] 21:08:10
 EXAMPLE OF WHAT TO EXPECT 
HERE.
>> Councilmember Salwan:  

[Captioner] 21:08:13
 SO ON 
WALNUT I THINK IT'S PASEO

[Captioner] 21:08:16
 ALL 
THE WAY DOWN TO MISSION, ALL 
THOSE HAVE BEEN MODIFIED

[Captioner] 21:08:19
 OR 
WHICH ONES HAVE BEEN MODIFIED ON

[Captioner] 21:08:22
 
WALNUT ALREADY?
>> Hans Larsen:   YES SO THE 


[Captioner] 21:08:25
FREMONT-WALNUT INTERSECTION ONE 
OF THE BENEFITS OF THIS

[Captioner] 21:08:28
 IS, IT'S 
COMPLETING SORT OF A LONGER 
CORRIDOR

[Captioner] 21:08:32
 THAT GOES ALL THE WAY 
FROM MISSION BOULEVARD, TO

[Captioner] 21:08:35
 THE 
FREMONT BART STATION, AND THEN

[Captioner] 21:08:39
 
OUT TO FREMONT BOULEVARD, THERE 
IS

[Captioner] 21:08:42
 A PROJECT THAT IS GOING TO BE 
STARTING

[Captioner] 21:08:45
 CONSTRUCTION SOON AT 
WALNUT

[Captioner] 21:08:48
 AND LIBERTY.
AND SO THE WHOLE WALNUT CORRIDOR

[Captioner] 21:08:52
 
FROM FREMONT TO MISSION HAS 
SEPARATE

[Captioner] 21:08:55
ED BIKEWAYS AND WILL HAVE 
SIX OF THESE PROTECT

[Captioner] 21:08:58
ED-STYLE 
INTERSECTIONS.
>> Councilmember Salwan:   THERE 


[Captioner] 21:09:02
IS ALSO MENTION OF A CONNECTION 
TO FREMONT HUB.
HOW IS

[Captioner] 21:09:05
 THAT GOING TO WORK?
>> Hans Larsen:   SO THE FREMONT

[Captioner] 21:09:08

FREMONT-WALNUT INTERSECTION, SO 
THIS WILL KIND

[Captioner] 21:09:11
 KIND OF CREATE THE -- 
CLOSE THE GAP

[Captioner] 21:09:14
 AND CREATE THE 
CORRIDOR FOR PEOPLE WHO WANT TO 
WALK OR BIKE

[Captioner] 21:09:17
 THERE.
SO THIS WILL BE A CONTINUATION 
OF

[Captioner] 21:09:21
 THE SEPARATION, FOR BIKEWAYS 
IN THERE.
THERE'S

[Captioner] 21:09:24
 A FEW LITTLE GAPS IN 
THERE THAT IN TERMS

[Captioner] 21:09:27
 OF THE WHOLE 
SYSTEM BUT THE MAJOR 
INTERSECTIONS WILL BE

[Captioner] 21:09:30
 COVERED 
WITH THIS PROJECT

[Captioner] 21:09:34
.
>> Councilmember Salwan:   OKAY.
AND THEN WHAT'S THE THINKING ON

[Captioner] 21:09:37
 
THE EUGENE GRIMMER FREMONT

[Captioner] 21:09:40
 
BOULEVARD, WHY THAT 
INTERSECTION, WHY -- WHAT'S 


[Captioner] 21:09:43
WRONG WITH THAT?
UG.


[Captioner] 21:09:46
YOU KNOW.
>> Hans Larsen:   THAT ONE IS

[Captioner] 21:09:50
 A 
VERY EXCITING PROJECT IN THAT IT

[Captioner] 21:09:53
 
PIECES TOGETHER A NUMBER OF 
PROJECTS THAT ARE ACTIVE

[Captioner] 21:09:56
.
IF YOU HAVE BEEN DOWN GRIMMER 
BOULEVARD FROM

[Captioner] 21:09:59
 FREMONT ALL THE 
WAY DOWN TO IRVINGTON HIGH 
SCHOOL, WE HAVE A PAINT

[Captioner] 21:10:03
 AND 
PLASTIC SEPARATED BIKEWAYS THERE 
ALONG THAT CORRIDOR.

[Captioner] 21:10:06

SO THAT'S A NICE CORRIDOR

[Captioner] 21:10:08
 THAT 
CONNECTS UP INTO THE IRVINGTON 
COMMUNITY.


[Captioner] 21:10:11
SO THIS PROJECT, AT FREMONT

[Captioner] 21:10:15
 AND 
GRIMMER INCLUDING THE NEARBY

[Captioner] 21:10:18
 
EUGENE INTERSECTION, WILL MAKE 
IT MUCH

[Captioner] 21:10:21
 FRIENDLIER TO WALK AND 
BIKE ACROSS THAT CORRIDOR.

[Captioner] 21:10:24

AND THEN WE RECEIVED RECENTLY A 
STATE GRANT TO BUILD

[Captioner] 21:10:28
 THE GRIMMER 
GREEN WAY TRAIL.
WHICH

[Captioner] 21:10:31
 WILL CREATE A SEPARATED 
LANDSCAPE

[Captioner] 21:10:34
 TRAIL ALONG THE NORTH 
SIDE OF GRIMMER, FROM

[Captioner] 21:10:38
 FREMONT 
BOULEVARD

[Captioner] 21:10:41
 TO PASEO PADRE PARKWAY 
AND

[Captioner] 21:10:44
 CONNECT TO CENTRAL PARK.
SO THIS IS A PIECE OF A IF YOU L 
OF

[Captioner] 21:10:47
 A REALLY NICE, YOU KNOW, 
NEIGHBORHOOD CONNECTOR

[Captioner] 21:10:51
 TO THE 
IRVINGTON BUSINESS DISTRICT AND 
THE CENTRAL

[Captioner] 21:10:54
 PARK, YOU KNOW, 
THAT'S INTENDED TO ATTRACT 
PEOPLE

[Captioner] 21:10:57
, YOU KNOW, FOR 
RECREATION, OR

[Captioner] 21:11:00
 BICYCLING OUT AND 
HAVE A

[Captioner] 21:11:03
 VERY SAFE EXPERIENCE AND 
A LONG CORRIDOR

[Captioner] 21:11:06
 OF STWREEMENT.
AND SO THIS PLUS WE'RE IN DESIGN

[Captioner] 21:11:10
 
WITH THE GRIMMER GREEN WAY TRAIL 
PROJECT.

[Captioner] 21:11:13

SO THAT WILL BE COMING TO 
COUNCIL LATER THIS YEAR TO SORT 


[Captioner] 21:11:16
OF COMPLETE THAT LAST GAP.


[Captioner] 21:11:20
>> Councilmember Salwan:   OKAY, 
AND IT SEEMS LIKE UJEENL

[Captioner] 21:11:24
 AND  
GRIMMER ARE

[Captioner] 21:11:27
 THE LIGHTS ARE RIGHT 
NEXT TO EACH OTHER.

[Captioner] 21:11:30

SEEMS LIKE THAT CREATES A LOT OF 
BOTTLENECK

[Captioner] 21:11:33
S.
ARE WE GOING TO FIRM IN THE 
PROBLEMS

[Captioner] 21:11:36
 THERE?
>> Hans Larsen:   YES, AGAIN 
WHEN WE MAKE THESE INVESTMENTS

[Captioner] 21:11:39
 
THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO 
MODERNIZE

[Captioner] 21:11:43
 AND INTERCONNECT AND 
CONNECT THE SIGNALS.
SO THE FLOW

[Captioner] 21:11:46
 OF TRAFFIC WILL WORK 
BETTER WITH THESE INVESTMENTS 
AND IT WILL BE --

[Captioner] 21:11:50
 WE THINK IT 
WILL LOOK MORE ATTRACTIVE AND IT 
WILL BE

[Captioner] 21:11:53
 BETTER CONNECTED FOR 
PEOPLE THAT ARE WALKING AND 
BIKING THROUGH THE AREA.

[Captioner] 21:11:56

>> Councilmember Salwan:   OKAY.
>> Hans Larsen:   THOSE TWO

[Captioner] 21:11:59
 WERE 
COMBINED FOR THE EXACT REASON 
THAT YOU MENTIONED THAT THEY'RE 


[Captioner] 21:12:02
SO CLOSE TOGETHER AND REALLY 
NEED TO KIND OF FUNCTION AS A 
UNIT

[Captioner] 21:12:06
.
>> Councilmember Salwan:   YOU 
MENTIONED THAT THE COUNCIL HAD 


[Captioner] 21:12:09
GIVEN DIRECTION AND THIS IS KIND 
OF THE LEFT OVER STUFF AS

[Captioner] 21:12:13
 PART 
OF THE PREVIOUS PLAN.
ARE THERE ANY OTHER ITEMS

[Captioner] 21:12:18
 THAT 
ARE COMING OR IS THAT THE LAST 
OF THE STUFF THAT IS

[Captioner] 21:12:21
 LEFT OVER 
AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO DO THE 
COMMUNITY ENGAGE

[Captioner] 21:12:24
MENT GET THE 
FEEDBACK AND THEN GO TO THE NEXT 
BATCH

[Captioner] 21:12:27
?
>> Hans Larsen:   YES SO IN 
TERMS OF KIND OF WORK IN THE 


[Captioner] 21:12:30
PIPELINE THAT WE'VE RECEIVED 
GRANTS FOR THAT ARE SORT OF THIS 
TYPE

[Captioner] 21:12:34
 OF IMPROVEMENT, THERE'S THE 
PROJECT

[Captioner] 21:12:37
 AT FREMONT AND COUNTRY, 
AT WASHINGTON HIGH SCHOOL,

[Captioner] 21:12:40
 SO 
THAT WILL ADDRESS THAT 
INTERSECTION.


[Captioner] 21:12:43
AND THEN WE HAVE

[Captioner] 21:12:46
 PROJECTS IN THE

[Captioner] 21:12:49
 
CENTERVILLE-MAIN STREET AREA AS 
PART

[Captioner] 21:12:53
 OF THE CENTERVILLE COMPLETE 
STREET CORRIDOR WHICH WENT 
THROUGH AN

[Captioner] 21:12:56
 EXTENSIVE COMMUNITY 
OUTREACH PROCESS, FOUR LANES, 
TWO LANES,

[Captioner] 21:12:59
 THREE LANES, AND, YOU 
KNOW, COUNCIL

[Captioner] 21:13:02
 SPECIFICALLY 
APPROVED KEEPING THAT AT TOWER 
LANES BUT

[Captioner] 21:13:05
 WITH SOME FEATURES TO 
MAKE IT FRIENDLY FOR WALKING AND 
BIKE

[Captioner] 21:13:08
ING.
AND SO THAT'S KIND OF THE LAST

[Captioner] 21:13:11
 
OF PROJECTS IN THE PIPELINE.
AND THEN I THINK NEW WORK

[Captioner] 21:13:15
 THAT 
WE DO WILL REALLY BE BASED ON 
THE

[Captioner] 21:13:18
 NEW ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION 
PLAN THAT WILL BE UNDER

[Captioner] 21:13:21
WAY LATER 
THIS YEAR.
>> Councilmember Salwan:   


[Captioner] 21:13:24
GREATLY.
AND I'VE SHARED IT PRIVATELY BUT

[Captioner] 21:13:26
 
THE COMMUNITY HAS A LOT OF 
CONCERNS.


[Captioner] 21:13:29
SO DEFINITELY WE NEED TO DO A 
LOT OF COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AND 
GET

[Captioner] 21:13:33
 THE FEEDBACK AND TRY TO 
ADDRESS THIS THROUGH LIKE A

[Captioner] 21:13:36
 MINI 
CAMPAIGN SO WHATEVER WE CAN DO 
TO MAKE PEOPLE

[Captioner] 21:13:39
 UNDERSTAND WHY 
THIS IS HAPPENING, WHAT THE 
OPTIONS

[Captioner] 21:13:42
 ARE, AND HOW WE CAN GET 
A WIN WIN OUT

[Captioner] 21:13:45
 OF THIS.
THANK YOU.
>> Hans Larsen:   ABSOLUTELY.


[Captioner] 21:13:48
WE REALLY LOOK TOWARD TO 
REACHING OUT TO THE COMMUNITY 
AND DOING

[Captioner] 21:13:52
 SOME UPDATED PLANNING.
>> Mayor Mei:   COUNCILMEMBER 
COX DID YOU HAVE

[Captioner] 21:13:55
 ANOTHER COMMENT 
BECAUSE I HAVE SOME COMMENTS TO 
MAKE

[Captioner] 21:13:58
 STILT.
>> Councilmember Cox:   YES I 
DID, THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 21:14:00

>> Mayor Mei:   SURE.
>> Councilmember Cox:   I HAD 


[Captioner] 21:14:03
ANOTHER QUESTION IN REGARDS TO 
THE GRIMMER BOULEVARD AS YOU 
KNOW

[Captioner] 21:14:06
 I GUESS THE IRVINGTON PART 
WILL BE

[Captioner] 21:14:09
 BUILT ON DOWN THE STREET 
FROM GRIMMER.
AND WONDERING WITH

[Captioner] 21:14:13
 ALL THESE 
ADDITIONS, HOW IS

[Captioner] 21:14:16
 THAT -- HAS 
THAT BEEN VETTED AND TAKEN A 
LOOK

[Captioner] 21:14:19
 AT AND CONSIDERED AS PART 
OF THIS DECISION FOR THE

[Captioner] 21:14:22
 
CONSTRUCTION RIGHT NOW?
AND ARE THESE LIKE

[Captioner] 21:14:26
 MORE WHITE 
CONES OR GREEN CONES?
HOW CAN

[Captioner] 21:14:29
 WE EXPLAIN THIS TO OUR 
CONSTITUENTS TO SHOW

[Captioner] 21:14:32
 THAT THIS 
IS GOING TO BE PROTECT

[Captioner] 21:14:36
ED THEN 
WHEN THEY'RE WALKING ACROSS THE 
STREET FOR THE

[Captioner] 21:14:38
 PEDESTRIANS 
ESPECIALLY?
>> Hans Larsen:   YES, I THINK 


[Captioner] 21:14:42
KIND OF THE -- WHAT I MENTIONED

[Captioner] 21:14:45
 
BEFORE IN TERMS OF WHAT THIS IS 
SORT OF MORE LIKE,

[Captioner] 21:14:48
 IT IS MORE 
LIKE THE WALNUT BIKEWAY AS 
OPPOSED TO MORE

[Captioner] 21:14:53
 OF THE SORT OF 
PAINT AND PLASTIC TREATMENTS 
THAT ARE ALONG OTHER

[Captioner] 21:14:56
 PARTS OF 
GRIMMER.
SO THE

[Captioner] 21:14:59
 INTERSECTION AT FREMONT, 
GRIMMER, WILL

[Captioner] 21:15:03
 LOOK VERY SIMILAR 
TO WHAT FREMONT

[Captioner] 21:15:06
 AND PASEO PADRE 
PARKWAY LOOK LIKE TODAY.


[Captioner] 21:15:13
>> Councilmember Cox:   OKAY.
>> Hans Larsen:   AND ALL OF 
THIS, YOU KNOW, THERE WAS

[Captioner] 21:15:17
 A 
STATION AREA PLAN THAT THE 
COUNCIL ADOPTED

[Captioner] 21:15:21
.
AS PART OF THE UPDATED PLAN FOR 
THE

[Captioner] 21:15:25
 IRVINGTON BART STATION.
AND PART OF THAT PLANNING EFFORT

[Captioner] 21:15:28
 
INCLUDED A COMMITMENT TO HAVE 
HIGH QUALITY

[Captioner] 21:15:31
 ACCESS INTO THE 
STATION AREA FOR PEOPLE WALKING 
AND

[Captioner] 21:15:34
 BIKING.
AND ACTUALLY, THE

[Captioner] 21:15:37
 -- THE 
CONTROVERSIAL OSGOOD

[Captioner] 21:15:41
 WASHINGTON 
INTERSECTION WAS A SPECIFIC 
IMPROVEMENT THAT WAS IN

[Captioner] 21:15:44
 THAT 
STATION AREA PLAN.

[Captioner] 21:15:49

>> Councilmember Cox:   OKAY.
DID WE -- DID YOU GET A CHANCE 


[Captioner] 21:15:52
TO WEIGH IN WITH THEIR MOBILITY 
COMMISSION TO GET THEIR

[Captioner] 21:15:55
 FEEDBACK 
SINCE THIS WOULD BE RIGHT UP 
THEIR ANGLE

[Captioner] 21:15:59
 FOR BOTH OF THESE 
TWO PROJECTS.
>> Hans Larsen:   YES I

[Captioner] 21:16:03
 THINK 
THEY'RE -- I THINK WE KEEP THEM 
INFORMED IN TERMS

[Captioner] 21:16:07
 OF PROJECTS 
THAT ARE COMING UP.
I THINK THE PROJECTS ARE

[Captioner] 21:16:10
 
GENERALLY ROOTED IN THE BICYCLE 
MASTER PLAN THAT WE HAVE

[Captioner] 21:16:14
, SO THE 
PROTECTED INTERSECTION IDEA

[Captioner] 21:16:17
 AND 
SORT OF THE KEY PRIORITY 
CORRIDORS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO 


[Captioner] 21:16:20
DEVELOP WITH THESE TYPES OF 
IMPROVEMENTS.
AND THE

[Captioner] 21:16:24
 MOBILITY COMMISSION WAS 
ACTIVELY INVOLVED

[Captioner] 21:16:27
 WITH THE 
DEVELOPMENT OF THE CURRENT BIKE 
PLAN THAT WE HAVE

[Captioner] 21:16:31
.
AND THEY'LL BE ENGAGED WITH THE 
NEW ONE THAT WE DEVELOP.

[Captioner] 21:16:33

>> Councilmember Cox:   DID THEY 
SUBMIT IN WRITING THAT THEY 


[Captioner] 21:16:36
WOULD SUPPORT BOTH OF THESE 
PROJECTS, DO YOU HAVE ANY

[Captioner] 21:16:39
 
DOCUMENTS FROM THEM, FROM THEIR 
MEETINGS

[Captioner] 21:16:43
 TO INDICATE THAT?
>> Hans Larsen:   YOU KNOW, I 
WOULDN'T

[Captioner] 21:16:46
 SAY -- THERE ISN'T SORT 
OF ANYTHING THAT FORMAL

[Captioner] 21:16:50
.
WE ACTUALLY, THE MOBILITY 
COMMISSION

[Captioner] 21:16:53
 HAS ACTUALLY ENGAGED 
IN WRITING LETTERS OF

[Captioner] 21:16:56
 SUPPORT 
FOR SOME OF THE GRANTS THAT WE 
APPLY FOR

[Captioner] 21:17:00
.
I DON'T RECALL IF THIS WAS ONE 
IN

[Captioner] 21:17:03
 PARTICULAR.
BUT I DO KNOW SORT

[Captioner] 21:17:06
 OF THAT THEY 
ARE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF, YOU 
KNOW,

[Captioner] 21:17:10
 THESE TYPES OF THINGS THAT 
THE CITY HAS BEEN BUILDING.
AND

[Captioner] 21:17:13
 THEY'RE AWARE OF THESE 
PROJECTS SPECIFICALLY.


[Captioner] 21:17:17
>> Councilmember Cox:   I WOULD 
FEEL A LOT BETTER IF THERE WAS 
SOMETHING IN

[Captioner] 21:17:20
 WRITING AS WE DO 
SOME OTHER DUE DILIGENCE, THAT 
THEY

[Captioner] 21:17:23
 WOULD HAVE BEEN SOMETHING 
PUT ON THEIR AGENDA FOR THEM

[Captioner] 21:17:26
 TO 
REVIEW BEFORE IT CAME TO CITY 
COUNCIL TO

[Captioner] 21:17:29
 SHOW THAT THEY HAD AT 
LEAST ADDRESSED

[Captioner] 21:17:33
 ANY CONCERNS, 
AND MAKE

[Captioner] 21:17:36
 SURE THAT THERE WAS 
ANYTHING THAT WE WEREN'T AWARE 
THAT

[Captioner] 21:17:39
 THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN AWARE 
SINCE THEY'RE SOMEWHAT EXPERTS

[Captioner] 21:17:42
 
IN SOME OF THESE DIFFERENT 
CHANNELS OF MOBILITY

[Captioner] 21:17:46
.
BUT I -- YOU KNOW, I WOULD HAVE 
LIKED

[Captioner] 21:17:49
 TO HAVE SEEN

[Captioner] 21:17:52
 A LITTLE BIT 
BETTER.
>> COUNCILMEMBER COX, UNLIKE SAY

[Captioner] 21:17:54
 
THE PLANNING COMMISSION, THE 
MOBILE COMMISSION DOES NOT 


[Captioner] 21:17:57
FUNCTION IN A SIMILAR -- IN THAT 
SAME MANNER IN

[Captioner] 21:18:01
 TERMS OF 
REVIEWING AND APPROVE

[Captioner] 21:18:04
ING PROJECTS 
THAT WILL THEN BE PRESENTED TO 
COUNCIL

[Captioner] 21:18:07
.
THEY'RE SHARED WITH THEM, 
THEY'RE DISCUSSED AMONG

[Captioner] 21:18:12
 THE 
COMMISSION.
BUT THEIR FUNCTION,

[Captioner] 21:18:15
 THEIR 
PURVIEW IS NOT TO APPROVE

[Captioner] 21:18:18
 
PROJECTS FOR PRESENTATION AND 
CONSIDERATION BY THE COUNCIL.

[Captioner] 21:18:21

SO WE HAVEN'T ENGAGED IN THAT

[Captioner] 21:18:24
 
PRACTICE WITH THEM IN THE PAST.
AND

[Captioner] 21:18:28
 SO, YOU KNOW, AGAIN, I DON'T 
THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE

[Captioner] 21:18:31
 
WOULD DO MOVING FORWARD.
BUT AS HANS

[Captioner] 21:18:34
 MENTIONED THEY DO 
OFTEN WRITE LETTERS OF

[Captioner] 21:18:37
 SUPPORT 
FOR THE VARIOUS FUNDING 
OPPORTUNITIES

[Captioner] 21:18:40
 THAT WE PURSUE FOR 
THESE VERY PROJECTS

[Captioner] 21:18:44
.
SO BY EXTENSION, YOU KNOW, IN 
MANY CASES

[Captioner] 21:18:47
, THAT IS A WRITTEN 
NORM

[Captioner] 21:18:51
 
ENDORSEMENT

[Captioner] 21:18:54
 OF THE PROJECTS YOU 
OFTEN SEE BEFORE YOU.
>> Councilmember Cox:   ARE YOU 


[Captioner] 21:18:57
SAYING HANS THIS YOU DO HAVE 
LETTERS OF SUPPORT THAT THEY 
WERE SUPPORTING THESE

[Captioner] 21:19:01
 TYPE OF 
GRANTS THAT WERE GOING TO BE 
USED INITIALLY?

[Captioner] 21:19:03

>> Hans Larsen:   I THINK WHERE 
THEY WOULD KIND OF WEIGH IN IS 


[Captioner] 21:19:07
MORE ON THE PLANNING LEVEL OF 
APPROVING THE SORT OF

[Captioner] 21:19:10
 BIKE PLAN, 
THEY BASICALLY TAKE AN ACTION ON 
THAT,

[Captioner] 21:19:13
 THE UPDATED VISION ZERO 
PLAN.
THEY ENGAGE KIND

[Captioner] 21:19:17
 OF MORE ON THE 
PLANNING PROCESS AS OPPOSED TO

[Captioner] 21:19:20
, 
YOU KNOW, THIS IS FINAL DESIGN 
ENGINEERING

[Captioner] 21:19:23
, YOU KNOW, KIND OF 
MORE ENGINEERING DETAIL STUFF

[Captioner] 21:19:26
.
AND SO THAT'S NOT BEEN AN AREA 
THAT

[Captioner] 21:19:29
 THEY'VE GOTTEN INTO, I MEAN 
THEY'RE MORE AT

[Captioner] 21:19:32
 THE SORT OF 
BEGINNING WHERE ARE WE GOING AND 
FRANK

[Captioner] 21:19:36
LY THEY'RE -- A BIG PART OF 
THEIR FOCUS

[Captioner] 21:19:39
 IS ENGAGEMENT.
I THINK WE BUILT A LOT OF GOOD 
INFRASTRUCTURE

[Captioner] 21:19:42
, WE WANT MORE 
PEOPLE TO USE IT AND THAT IS 
KIND OF A ROLE

[Captioner] 21:19:45
 THAT THEY'VE 
TAKEN ON THAT THEY CAN DO HOW DO 
WE

[Captioner] 21:19:48
 INFORM THE COMMUNITY ENGAGE 
THEM TO USE THIS AND

[Captioner] 21:19:52
 GET MORE 
PEOPLE WALKING AND BIKING IN 
FREMONT.


[Captioner] 21:19:55
SO I THINK AS WE GO THROUGH 
UPDATED

[Captioner] 21:19:58
 ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION 
PLANNING PROCESS, THERE MAY BE

[Captioner] 21:20:01

BE -- YOU KNOW, WE'LL SEE HOW 
THEY'RE --

[Captioner] 21:20:05
 YOU'LL PROBABLY SEE 
THEM MORE ENGAGED IN THAT EFFORT 
THAN SORT

[Captioner] 21:20:08
 OF DETAILED DESIGN 
WORK.
WHICH LARGELY WE'RE

[Captioner] 21:20:12
 FOLLOWING 
ADOPTED TRANSPORTATION

[Captioner] 21:20:14
 
ENGINEERING DESIGN STANDARDS.
>> Councilmember Cox:   OKAY.


[Captioner] 21:20:17
THANK YOU.
AND ALSO, TO THE CITY MANAGER 
FOR HER CLARIFICATION ON

[Captioner] 21:20:21
 THE 
SCOPE OF WORK AND THE 
EXPECTATIONS

[Captioner] 21:20:24
 THAT ARE THERE SO 
THANK YOU FOR REEMPHASIZING 
THAT.

[Captioner] 21:20:26

THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei:   SO I JUST WANT 


[Captioner] 21:20:29
TO SHARE MY THOUGHTS ON THIS AND 
SHARE SOME BACKGROUND

[Captioner] 21:20:32
.
ORIGINALLY THIS WAS A TASK FORCE 
PRIOR TO BECOMING A COMMISSION

[Captioner] 21:20:36
.
AND AT THAT TIME, WE WERE HOPING 
TO DEVELOP SOME

[Captioner] 21:20:39
 OF THE MOBILITY 
VISION FOR DIFFERENT

[Captioner] 21:20:42
 AREAS BOTH 
PEDESTRIAN, BICYCLE AS WELL AS 
DRIVERS

[Captioner] 21:20:45
 AND THERE DIFFERENT 
ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION AS WELL AS 
PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION.

[Captioner] 21:20:48

AND SO I KNOW THAT THEY CAME UP 
WITH A MOBILITY PLAN

[Captioner] 21:20:51
 AFTER WHICH 
WE FORMED A COMMISSION.
AND THERE WERE ORIGINAL

[Captioner] 21:20:54
LY TEN 
ITEMS THAT THEY WERE TARGETING.
WITHIN

[Captioner] 21:20:58
 THOSE ITEMS I KNOW THAT 
WE HAD LOOKED AT THINGS LIKE

[Captioner] 21:21:02
 THE 
BANK MASTER PLAN, PEDESTRIAN 
MARCHG AND

[Captioner] 21:21:05
 WE CERTAINLY HEARD 
MORE FROM THE COMMUNITY MEMBERS 

[Captioner] 21:21:08

ON COMMUNITY MEMBERS FROM 
DRIVERS MAKING SURE

[Captioner] 21:21:12
 THE FLOW IS 
ACTIVE.
HAVING THE SIGNALING

[Captioner] 21:21:15
, WAS 
MENTIONED MANY YEARS AGO WE 
UPDATED

[Captioner] 21:21:18
 THE LED LIGHTS 
THROUGHOUT THE CITY BUT WE 
WEREN'T ABILITY TO

[Captioner] 21:21:22
 UPDATE ALL 
THE SIGNALING.
SOME OF THEM WERE PRE

[Captioner] 21:21:24
DATING, 
QUITE A FEW OF THE SIGNALING WAS 
PROBABLY FROM THE

[Captioner] 21:21:28
 1990s I 
WOULD HOPE AT LEAST MAYBE

[Captioner] 21:21:31
 1980S 
EERVE.
>> Mayor Mei:   20

[Captioner] 21:21:34

>> Hans Larsen:  

[Captioner] 21:21:37
 20,  
30-YEAR-OLD TECHNOLOGY.
>> Mayor Mei:   THAT IS

[Captioner] 21:21:40
 GOING TO 
BE IMPORTANT.
I HAVE HEARD THE CONCERNS BUT I 


[Captioner] 21:21:43
HAVE SEEN A LOT OF THE CONCERNS 
AND THE IMPACT REGARDING THOSE 
INTERSECTION

[Captioner] 21:21:46
S AND QUESTIONS 
WHETHER IT'S FREMONT AND WALNUT 
WHICH IS

[Captioner] 21:21:50
 CONTINUING THE WALNUT 
CORRIDOR BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY I

[Captioner] 21:21:53
 
THINK FREMONT GRIMMER AND THE 
ONE BY FREEMAN AND COUNTRY

[Captioner] 21:21:57
 AND 
EUGENE BECAUSE I'VE SEEN THOSE 
AS BEING MAJOR

[Captioner] 21:22:00
 CORRIDORS 
ESPECIALLY FOR DROPOFF AND 
PICKUP IN THE DAY

[Captioner] 21:22:03
.
SO I WOULD LOVE TO BE ABLE TO 
HELP FACILITATE FLOW FOR

[Captioner] 21:22:06
 THE 
SCHOOLS TO BE ABLE TO GET IN AND 
OUT BUT

[Captioner] 21:22:10
 I'M ALSO CONCERNED 
GREATLY BECAUSE I HAVE SEEN OVER 
THE YEARS

[Captioner] 21:22:13
 AS A PARENT IN THAT 
AREA PEOPLE USING THE LANES

[Captioner] 21:22:16
.
AND THAT'S WHY I'M GLAD YOU PUT 
SOME

[Captioner] 21:22:19
 OF THOSE PLASTIC BOLLARDS,

[Captioner] 21:22:22
 
PEOPLE DRIVE TOO QUICKLY AND I 
SEE THEM DRIFT

[Captioner] 21:22:25
ING INTO THOSE 
AREAS, AND PEOPLE

[Captioner] 21:22:28
 DON'T FLOW 
INTO THAT AREA AND I SEE

[Captioner] 21:22:31
 POOR 
BEHAVIOR AS PEOPLE USING THEM AS 
DROPOFF AND

[Captioner] 21:22:35
 PICKUP POINTS IN THE 
MIDDLE OF THE STREET LITERALLY

[Captioner] 21:22:38
 
IN THE MEDIAN PICKING UP THEIR 
CHILDREN WHICH I THOUGHT WAS 


[Captioner] 21:22:42
INCREDIBLY DANGEROUS.
SO I THINK HAVING WAYS TO NARROW 
SOME OF

[Captioner] 21:22:45
 THAT WALKWAY IS A 
CONCERN AND TO BE ABLE TO 
ADDRESS THAT.


[Captioner] 21:22:48
BUT I DO WANT TO ENCOURAGE AND I 
HEARD THE COMMENTS FROM BOTH

[Captioner] 21:22:51
 MY 
COLLEAGUES AS WELL AS THE 
PUBLIC,

[Captioner] 21:22:54
 IN TEMPS OF EXPERIMENT 

[Captioner] 21:22:58
AL 
AND WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT THESE 
TO BE ABLE TO

[Captioner] 21:23:01
 ANALYZE TRUE DATA 
AS A RESULT OF WHAT IT

[Captioner] 21:23:04
 MEANS TO 
THE FLOW THERE, I KNOW A LOT OF 
PEOPLE WRITE

[Captioner] 21:23:07
 TO ME HOW DO I WAIT 
THREE LIGHTS VERSUS

[Captioner] 21:23:10
 TWO LIGHTS 
OR WHATNOT, BUT ONE OF THE 
REASONS

[Captioner] 21:23:14
 WHY TO GIVE THE PUBLIC 
KNOWLEDGE WHY WE REMOVED

[Captioner] 21:23:17
 SOME OF 
THOSE DRIVE THROUGH LANES OR I 
GUESS ROLLING

[Captioner] 21:23:20
 LANES, WE'VE HAD 
PEOPLE MANY TIMES IN THE PAST

[Captioner] 21:23:23
 
UNFORTUNATELY THOSE WERE SOME OF 
THE MAJOR CORRIDORS WHEN WE 


[Captioner] 21:23:26
LACKED AT OUR FLOW OF TRAFFIC, 
90% OF OUR

[Captioner] 21:23:30
 ACCIDENTS AND 
INCIDENTS OCCURRED UPON 10% OF

[Captioner] 21:23:33
 
OUR MAJOR ROADWAYS AND THESE ARE 
SOME OF THE MAJOR ROADWAYS

[Captioner] 21:23:36
 THAT 
WE LOOKED AT.
AND SO I JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY

[Captioner] 21:23:40
 
REALLY QUICKLY THE POINT THAT 
YOU MENTIONED EARLIER UPON A 


[Captioner] 21:23:43
CLARIFICATION FROM ONE OF OUR 
COUNCILMEMBERS.
IF THE FUNDING IS NOT APPROVED 


[Captioner] 21:23:46
OR PUT INTO PLACE, DO WE RISK 
LOSING THE FUNDING

[Captioner] 21:23:49
?
AND IF WE PUT THE CONTRACT IN 
PLACE CAN WE STILL

[Captioner] 21:23:52
 LOOK AT THE 
DESIGNS AND STILL -- BECAUSE

[Captioner] 21:23:55
 I 
KNOW WE'RE APPROVING IT FOR THE 
CONTRACT BUT IS

[Captioner] 21:23:58
 THERE AN 
OPPORTUNITY TO STILL MODIFY IT

[Captioner] 21:24:00
 
PRIOR TO THE ACTUAL 
CONSTRUCTION?


[Captioner] 21:24:03
WE'RE APPROVING THE CONTRACT BUT 
NOT DOING THE BUILD AT LEAST FOR

[Captioner] 21:24:06
 
NOW DURING THE RAINY SEASON SO 
WHAT IS THE

[Captioner] 21:24:09
 TIME FRAME WE WOULD 
ACTUALLY ROLL OUT THE BUILD

[Captioner] 21:24:11
?
>> Hans Larsen:   SO THE MONEY 
IS SECURED.


[Captioner] 21:24:14
SO THE MONEY HAS BEEN COMMITTED 
TO US FOR THESE PROJECTS AND

[Captioner] 21:24:18
 OUR 
COMMITMENT IS THAT WE GET A 
PROJECT INTO

[Captioner] 21:24:21
 CONSTRUCTION IN A 
TIMELY MANNER.
YOU KNOW, I THINK

[Captioner] 21:24:25
 THE DESIGNS 
ARE

[Captioner] 21:24:28
 -- I DON'T THINK YOU 
WOULD --

[Captioner] 21:24:31
 I MEAN IT'S 
ESSENTIAL -- YOU KNOW

[Captioner] 21:24:34
 THE DESIGN 
IS AROUND BUILDING A PROTECTED 
INTERSECTION

[Captioner] 21:24:37
 AND THERE ARE 
CERTAIN STANDARD WAY THAT THOSE

[Captioner] 21:24:40
 
ARE PUT TOGETHER, YOU KNOW, 
THERE IS

[Captioner] 21:24:44
 -- WE'RE NOT TAKING 
AWAY ANY THROUGH-LANES OR 
CAPACITY

[Captioner] 21:24:47
.
AND SO -- AND THERE'S NOT A 
REALISTIC

[Captioner] 21:24:52
 OPPORTUNITY SORT OF TO 
CHANGE IT.
SO THESE ARE THE PLANS WE

[Captioner] 21:24:55
 PUT 
TOGETHER.
IT'S CONSISTENT WITH, YOU KNOW,

[Captioner] 21:24:58
 
WHAT WE HAVE CONVEYED IN TERMS 
OF GETTING THE

[Captioner] 21:25:01
 GRANT SO I THINK 
WE MOVE FORWARD WITH IT.


[Captioner] 21:25:05
IN TERMS OF THE ACTUAL 
CONSTRUCTION, SO

[Captioner] 21:25:08
, YOU KNOW, WE 
ARE PROPOSING TO AWARD THE 
CONTRACT TODAY

[Captioner] 21:25:11
, WITH TRAFFIC 
SIGNAL PROJECTS, THERE'S A LONG 
LEAD

[Captioner] 21:25:14
 TIME.
FOR PROCURING

[Captioner] 21:25:17
 KIND OF THE POLLS 
AND PIECES, SO THE

[Captioner] 21:25:21
 CONTRACTOR 
WON'T GET OUT THERE UNTIL THEY 
HAVE EVERYTHING PROCURED

[Captioner] 21:25:24
.
AND SO IT LIKELY

[Captioner] 21:25:27
 WILL BE MAYBE 
SIX MONTHS BEFORE WE ACTUALLY 
SEE

[Captioner] 21:25:30
 THE PHYSICAL CONSTRUCTION 
OCCURRING.
SO IT IS NOT GOING

[Captioner] 21:25:34
 TO START, YOU 
KNOW, NOW IN THE RAINY SEASON

[Captioner] 21:25:37
 
BUT MORE LIKELY WE'LL GET GOING 
WHERE MOST OF THE WORK IS

[Captioner] 21:25:40
 DURING 
THE SUMMER AND THE FALL.
>> Mayor Mei:   CAN WE ASK THAT

[Captioner] 21:25:43
 
FROM THE FEEDBACK THAT I'VE 
HEARD FROM MY COLLEAGUES

[Captioner] 21:25:46
 THIS 
EVENING THAT WE DO EXTENSIVE

[Captioner] 21:25:49
 
OUTREACH PARTICULARLY TO THE 
RESIDENTS AND THE SCHOOLS THERE 


[Captioner] 21:25:52
AS WELL AS THE COMMUNITY TO MAKE 
SURE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND WHAT IS 
IT

[Captioner] 21:25:55
 UNDERGOING THAT'S HAPPENING 
AND THE REASONS WHY, AS WELL AS 
THE

[Captioner] 21:25:59
 DATA RESULTS AFTER.
ONE OF THE THINGS AFTER

[Captioner] 21:26:02
 WE 
COMPLETE THESE PROJECTS WOULD BE 
GREAT, SO SOME

[Captioner] 21:26:05
 PEOPLE WILL HAVE 
SOME IDEA OF WHAT THE RESULTS 
WERE THERE

[Captioner] 21:26:08
.
>> Hans Larsen:   YES ABSOLUTELY 
AND I THINK THAT'S PART OF THE 


[Captioner] 21:26:11
OUTREACH THAT WE'RE GOING TO DO 
WITH THE UPDATED

[Captioner] 21:26:14
 PLANS, HOW 
THINGS WORKED, HOW ARE THEY

[Captioner] 21:26:18
 
PERFORMED, WHAT KIND OF SAFETY

[Captioner] 21:26:21
 
IMPROVEMENTS, THAT IS PART OF 
THE PROGRAM WE'RE ENVISION

[Captioner] 21:26:24
ING 
AND IN TERMS OF THE ACTUAL 
CONSTRUCTION IMPACTS TO THE

[Captioner] 21:26:27
 
COMMUNITY WHEN THE CONTRACTOR 
HAS EVERYTHING READY, WE WILL DO

[Captioner] 21:26:31
 
OUTREACH LET PEOPLE KNOW THAT, 
YOU KNOW, THESE INTERSECTION

[Captioner] 21:26:34
S 
ARE GOING TO BE OCCUPIED WITH 
SOME

[Captioner] 21:26:37
 CONSTRUCTION.
AND IF THEY CAN AVOID THE AREAS,

[Captioner] 21:26:40
 
WE CAN SET EXPECTATIONS ON WHEN 
THERE MAY BE SOME

[Captioner] 21:26:43
 IMPACTS DURING 
CONSTRUCTION.
SO THAT'S A NORMAL PART OF THE 


[Captioner] 21:26:46
CONSTRUCTION OUTREACH THAT WE 
DO.
>> Mayor Mei:   OKAY, THANK YOU

[Captioner] 21:26:50
.
SO FOR ITEM 2E DO

[Captioner] 21:26:53

YEAH

THIS, IF YOU LOOK AT THIS, IT'S

[Captioner] 21:29:25
 
A SITE MAP.
BUT IT

[Captioner] 21:29:28
 DOESN'T CORRESPOND TO ANY 
OF THE WORDING HERE BECAUSE THIS 
IS NOT THE FINAL

[Captioner] 21:29:31
 MAP.

[Captioner] 21:29:38

THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS YOU ARE 
BEING ASKED

[Captioner] 21:29:41
 TO APPROVE AND NOT

PIG

[Captioner] 21:29:49

[Captioner] 21:29:55
 
KEEPS SAYING IT'S BEEN FINAL,

[Captioner] 21:29:58
 
IT'S AVAILABLE FOR REVIEW.
WHERE IS IT

[Captioner] 21:30:02
?
WHERE IS THE REAL MAPS?
WHERE IS THE REAL

[Captioner] 21:30:05
 AGREEMENTS?
NONE OF THIS IS PRESENTED

[Captioner] 21:30:08
 IN THE 
PACKET TODAY.
IT'S

[Captioner] 21:30:11
 ALL ON SOME ASSURANCE THAT

[Captioner] 21:30:15
 
IT IS SOMEWHERE IN THE FILE.
YOU'RE BEING ASKED TO APPROVE

[Captioner] 21:30:20
 
SOMETHING THAT I'M SURE NONE OF

[Captioner] 21:30:23
YOU CAN REVIEW IT, YOU COULD BUT 
NONE

[Captioner] 21:30:26
 OF YOU HAVE GONE OUT OF 
YOUR WAY TO REVIEW THIS STUFF.

[Captioner] 21:30:30

MY MAIN CONCERN HERE IS THERE 
WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A

[Captioner] 21:30:33
 BIKE 
PEDESTRIAN LANE ALONG THESE 
RAILROAD TRACKS AND IT'S 


[Captioner] 21:30:36
SUPPOSED TO GO ALL THE WAY TO 
THE ALAMEDA CREEK AND THEN WE

[Captioner] 21:30:39
 
HEARD, IT GOT NARROWED.
IT GOT NARROWED TO

[Captioner] 21:30:42
 A LITTLE TEN 
FEET THING, WASN'T FULL WIDTH

[Captioner] 21:30:45
 AT 
THE END.
AND NOW ON THIS MAP IT RUNS INTO 


[Captioner] 21:30:48
A BLACK WALL.
THERE ARE OPENINGS IN THE

[Captioner] 21:30:52
 WALL, 
ELSEWHERE ALONG THE CREEK.
ALONG THESE

[Captioner] 21:30:55
 PRIVATE PROPERTIES, 
REMEMBER ALL THOSE PRIVATE 
PROPERTY LETTERS

[Captioner] 21:30:58
 WHO CAME HERE 
AND DEMANDED THAT YOU BLOCK IT

[Captioner] 21:31:01
 
OFF BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T WANT THE 
PASSAGEWAYS

[Captioner] 21:31:05
, WE HAVE ALL KINDS 
MUCH OPENINGS ALONG THE

[Captioner] 21:31:08
 PASSAGE, 
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS, 
VERY STRANGE

[Captioner] 21:31:11
, YOU WERE SUPPOSED 
TO HAVE TWO ENTRANCES

[Captioner] 21:31:14
 AND EXITS.
I WONDER WHERE THIS

[Captioner] 21:31:17
 COMMENT, AND 
THE BIKE

[Captioner] 21:31:21
-PEDESTRIAN, THESE ARE 
ON BIKE

[Captioner] 21:31:24
 GLASS WALL.
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU

[Captioner] 21:31:28

[Captioner] 21:31:38

COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN DO YOU HAVE 
ANY QUESTIONS ON

[Captioner] 21:31:41
 THAT?
>> Councilmember Salwan:   YES, 
I WONDER IF STAFF

[Captioner] 21:31:45
 COULD ANSWER 
THE QUESTIONS MR. ABREU

[Captioner] 21:31:48
 A

[Captioner] 21:31:51
BREW RAISED.
>> Hans Larsen:   KIND OF STAFF

[Captioner] 21:31:53
 
CERTIFICATION THAT THE PLANS AND 
AGREEMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN 


[Captioner] 21:31:56
PREPARED AND SUBMITTED BY THE 

[Captioner] 21:32:00
 
DEVELOPER ARE CONSISTENT WITH 
THE APPROVALS THAT COUNCIL AND

[Captioner] 21:32:02
 
THE PLANNING COMMISSION HAVE 
GRANTED.


[Captioner] 21:32:05
AND SO ESSENTIALLY THE PROJECT'S 
BEEN APPROVED, THE

[Captioner] 21:32:08
 DETAILS OF IT 
BUT ALL THE ENGINEERING DRAWINGS 
AND AGREEMENTS HAVE

[Captioner] 21:32:11
 BEEN 
SUBMITTED.
AND SO EVERYTHING IS FINALIZE

[Captioner] 21:32:14
ED 
AND READY FOR APPROVAL.
WE'RE

[Captioner] 21:32:17
 CERTIFYING EVERYTHING IS 
CONSISTENT WITH THE APPROVALS 
THAT ARE GRANT

[Captioner] 21:32:20
ED.
THE SPECIFIC DOCUMENTS ARE 
AVAILABLE TO THE

[Captioner] 21:32:24
 PUBLIC ON 
REQUEST.
AND HAPPY TO MAKE THAT AVAILABLE

[Captioner] 21:32:27

AVAILABLE.
THE REFERENCE TO

[Captioner] 21:32:32
 THE KIND OF 
WALKWAY TRAIL CONNECTION THROUGH

[Captioner] 21:32:35
 
THE SITE, IT IS A TEN FOOT PATH

[Captioner] 21:32:38
.
IT MAY APPEAR THAT IT RUNS TO A

[Captioner] 21:32:41
 A 
WALL ON THE PLAN BUT THAT DARK 
LINE IS JUST

[Captioner] 21:32:44
 THE PROPERTY 
BOUNDARY.
SO THAT IT DOES INDEED OPEN

[Captioner] 21:32:48
 UP 
TO THE ALAMEDA CREEK TRAIL WHICH 
IS WHAT

[Captioner] 21:32:51
 ITS INTENDED PURPOSE IS.
>> Councilmember Salwan:   OKAY

[Captioner] 21:32:54

SO I MEAN SO IF COUNCIL IF WE 
WANT TO

[Captioner] 21:32:58
 VERIFY THESE HOW WOULD 
WE -- WOULD WE ASK

[Captioner] 21:33:01

>> Hans Larsen:   YES,

[Captioner] 21:33:04
 I THINK 
THESE ARE HUNDRED PAGE PLAN SETS 
OF

[Captioner] 21:33:07
 ENGINEERING DOCUMENTS AND A 
LOT OF LEGAL AGREEMENTS

[Captioner] 21:33:10
.
YOU KNOW, THEY'RE AVAILABLE TO 
THE PUBLIC IF SOMEBODY WANTS

[Captioner] 21:33:14
 TO 
CHECK.
AND FOR

[Captioner] 21:33:17
 COUNCILMEMBERS THAT WANT 
TO LOOK THROUGH IT, I THINK, YOU 
KNOW, THIS IS

[Captioner] 21:33:20
 A TYPICAL ACTION 
THAT WE DO, IS IT IS OUR

[Captioner] 21:33:23
 JOB TO 
BASICALLY APPROVE THE

[Captioner] 21:33:26
 WORK OF 
THE DEVELOPERS AND MAKE SURE 
THAT IT'S

[Captioner] 21:33:29
 CONSISTENT WITH THE 
APPROVALS THAT HAVE BEEN GRANTED 
AND SO THIS IS

[Captioner] 21:33:34
 OUR 
RECOMMENDATION TO COUNCIL THAT 
THAT WORK IS DONE AND WE'RE

[Captioner] 21:33:37
 
ASKING YOU TO SORT OF BLESS IT

HERE AND WANTS TO ADD

[Captioner] 21:34:09
 THAT.
I EXPECT SO

[Captioner] 21:34:13

REQUESTED ALONG

CORRIDOR.
THE SPECIFIC LOCATION OF

[Captioner] 21:54:07
 THE 
SIGN AND ITS FROIMENT TO THE

[Captioner] 21:54:10
 
INTERSTATE 680 CORRIDOR ARE 
INCOMPATIBLE

[Captioner] 21:54:14
 WITH THE AREA, AND 
IMHUMAN NAILINGS OF THE SIGN IS

[Captioner] 21:54:17
 
AN INAPPROPRIATE DESIGN ELEMENT.
NEXT SLIDE PLEASE

.
THE APPELLANT'S APPEAL LETTER 
MADE

[Captioner] 21:54:24
 THE FOLLOWING POINTS TO 
JUSTIFY THEIR REQUEST TO

SUCH

[Captioner] 21:54:33
 AS DENSE TREES ON THE

[Captioner] 21:54:52
GROUNDS THAT THIS IS NOT A 
REASON TO DENY UNDER

[Captioner] 21:54:55
 THE FREMONT

REGARDING THE FINDING

[Captioner] 21:54:59
 THAT THE 
APPROVAL WOULD CREATE A 
PRECEDENT

[Captioner] 21:55:02
, FEW LOTS ON THE I 680 
CORRIDOR

[Captioner] 21:55:09
 SUCH 
A SIGN AND THESE LOTS ARE 
ALREADY DEVELOPED WITH

[Captioner] 21:55:11
 LONG 
STANDING USES.
REGARDING THE FINDING THAT THE 


[Captioner] 21:55:15
LOCATION AND THE DESIGN OF THE 
PROPOSED DESIGN WOULD BE 
INCOMPATIBLE

 WITH THE CHARACTER 
OF THE AREA THE APPELLANT STATES 
THAT THEY ADDRESSED

[Captioner] 21:56:31
 CREATE A 
SIGNIFICANT VISUAL IMPACT ON THE 
REAR OF THE

[Captioner] 21:56:35
 SITE.
FINALLY, STAFF BELIEVES THAT THE 
OFF

[Captioner] 21:56:38
SITE IMPACTS RELATED TO 
LIGHTING WOULD BE LESS THAN

[Captioner] 21:56:41
 
SIGNIFICANT, AS THE PROPOSED 
INTERNAL ILLUMINATION IS LIMIT

[Captioner] 21:56:44
ED 
TO THE LETTERS AND THE LOGO.
THE REST OF THE SIGN WILL BE

[Captioner] 21:56:48
 
OPAQUE BLACK AND THE COLUMNS 
WOULD HELP BLOCK VIEWS OF THE

[Captioner] 21:56:51
 
ILLUMINATED PORTION OF THE SIGN 
CABINET FROM THE NEAREST

[Captioner] 21:56:54
 
RESIDENTIAL USES LOCATED 
APPROXIMATELY 500 FEET ACROSS 


[Captioner] 21:56:57
THE FREEWAY AND BEHIND THE SOUND 
WALL

[Captioner] 21:57:00
.
NEXT SLIDE, PLEASE.


[Captioner] 21:57:04
THE CITY'S ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT 
DIRECTOR WOULD NOW LIKE TO SPEAK 
TO THE

[Captioner] 21:57:07
 ECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS 
OF THE PROJECT.
DONOVAN.

[Captioner] 21:57:11

>> THANK YOU JAMES.
AS JAMES MENTIONED MY NAME IS

[Captioner] 21:57:14
 
DONOVAN LAZARO AND I HAVE

[Captioner] 21:57:17
 THE 
PRIVILEGE OF SERVING AS THE 
ECONOMIC DIRECTOR HERE IN

[Captioner] 21:57:21
 
FREMONT.
I'M HERE WITH YOU

[Captioner] 21:57:25
 THIS EVENING 
TO REINFORCE SUPPORT OF THE

[Captioner] 21:57:29
 PAPE 
SIGN AND PROVIDE ADDITIONAL 
INFORMATION FOR

[Captioner] 21:57:33
 YOUR 
CONSIDERATION.
AS HAS BEEN MENTIONED

[Captioner] 21:57:36
, PAPE HAS 
OPERATED HERE SINCE 1984

[Captioner] 21:57:39
.
THEIR CUSTOMERS INCLUDE ALL OF 
OUR REGIONAL UTILITY

[Captioner] 21:57:42
 PROVIDERS, 
MOST CITIES AND PUBLIC AGENCIES.
THIS PROJECT

[Captioner] 21:57:45
 IS THE MOST 
EXPENSIVE INVESTMENT IN THE 
COMPANY'S HISTORY

[Captioner] 21:57:49
, CONSOLIDATING 
MULTIPLE REGIONAL LOCATIONS INTO

[Captioner] 21:57:52
 
TREATMENT AND PROVIDING A 
THOUGHTFULLY DESIGNED DEALERSHIP

[Captioner] 21:57:55
 
AND CORPORATION YARD.
IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO THOAT 


[Captioner] 21:57:58
THAT EVEN BEFORE THIS NEW 
DEALERSHIP OPENS, PAPE

[Captioner] 21:58:01
'S ALREADY 
ONE OF THE CITY'S LARGEST

[Captioner] 21:58:05
 TAX 
REVENUE GENERATORS AND REALLY IS 
AN EXAMPLE OF THE

[Captioner] 21:58:08
 DIVERSITY AND 
RESILIENCE OF THE FREMONT'S TAX 
BASE

[Captioner] 21:58:11
.
NEXT SLIDE PLEASE.
THIS PROJECT

[Captioner] 21:58:14
 HAS BEEN FIVE YEARS 
IN THE MAKING.
TAKING A VACANT SITE

[Captioner] 21:58:18
 THAT WAS 
LONG CONSIDERED UNDEVELOPABLE, 
DUE TO THE

[Captioner] 21:58:21
 MAJOR OVERHEAD AND 
UNDERGROUND UTILITIES THAT

[Captioner] 21:58:24
 
TRAVERSE IT AND TURNING IT INTO 
A SOURCE OF JOB CREATION,

[Captioner] 21:58:27
 CITY 
TAX REVENUE AND A HUB FOR 
SUPPLYING

[Captioner] 21:58:31
 CRITICAL 
INFRASTRUCTURE TO OUR REGION.
THE GOVERNOR'S

[Captioner] 21:58:34
 OFFICE RECOGNIZED 
PAPE'S SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT 
AND THE

[Captioner] 21:58:38
 CRITICALLY IMPORTANT 
ROLE OF ITS SERVICES TO THE 
REGION

[Captioner] 21:58:41
'S DEVELOPMENT AND 
PROVIDED TAX OFFSET

[Captioner] 21:58:44
 TO HELP THE 
COMPANY'S SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT 
FOR THIS SITE.

[Captioner] 21:58:47

IT IS STAFF'S PROFESSIONAL 
OPINION THAT THERE IS A

[Captioner] 21:58:51
 
LEGITIMATE CASE FOR THE SIGN DUE 
TO THE SITE'S UNIQUE CONDITIONS 


[Captioner] 21:58:54
INCLUDING THE BUILDING'S 
SIGNIFICANT SET BACK FROM THE 
FREEWAY

[Captioner] 21:58:57
 AS A RESULT OF 
UNDERGROUND EASEMENTS,

[Captioner] 21:59:00
 MAJOR 
OVERHEAD POWER LINES AND LARGE 
EQUIPMENT THAT

[Captioner] 21:59:04
 WILL OCCUPY THE 
CORPORATION YARD AND PARTIALLY

[Captioner] 21:59:07
 
OBSTRUCT THE BUILDING ONCE THE 
DEALERSHIP

[Captioner] 21:59:10
 IS OPERATIONAL.
IN STAFF'S VIEW THE SIGN IS 
APPROPRIATE

[Captioner] 21:59:13
LY DESIGNED AND 
APPROPRIATELY SCALED FOR THE 
SITE AND WE

[Captioner] 21:59:15
 RECOMMEND COUNCIL 
APPROVAL.
JAMES.


[Captioner] 21:59:19
>> NEXT SLIDE PLEASE.


[Captioner] 21:59:22
STAFF RECOMMENDS THAT THE CITY 
COUNCIL FIND THE PROJECT EXEMPT

[Captioner] 21:59:26
 
FROM CEQA FOR REASONS ENUMERATED 
IN THE STAFF

[Captioner] 21:59:29

DETERMINE THE PROJECT TO BE IN 
COMPLIANCE

[Captioner] 21:59:32
 WITH THE APPLICABLE 
DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS.
AND IS CONSISTENT

[Captioner] 21:59:35
 WITH THE 
GENERAL PLAN.
FTC SATISFY RECOMMENDS THE

[Captioner] 21:59:38
 CITY 
COUNCIL GRANT THE APPEAL, AND

NEXT SLIDE PLEASE.
STAFF IS AVAILABLE TO

[Captioner] 21:59:51

QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS PROJECT.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 21:59:56
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.
WE BEGIN WITH QUESTIONS FROM THE

[Captioner] 21:59:58
 
COUNCIL.
I'LL START WITH COUNCILMEMBER 


[Captioner] 22:00:01
KENG.
>> Vice Mayor Keng:   THANK YOU

[Captioner] 22:00:04
.
SO CAN YOU SHARE AGAIN REAL 
QUICK ABOUT THE

[Captioner] 22:00:07
 CHANGE IN THE 
PROPOSED LIGHTING OF THE SIGN

[Captioner] 22:00:11
, 
PLEASE?

[Captioner] 22:00:14

>> THE PROPOSED LIGHTING OR THE 
SIZE OF THE SIGN?

[Captioner] 22:00:16

>> Vice Mayor Keng:   THE 
LIGHTING.


[Captioner] 22:00:19
>> I THINK SHE'S REFERRING TO 
THE DIMMING.
>> YES, I

[Captioner] 22:00:22
 UNDERSTAND THAT THE 
APPLICANT HAS AGREED TO HAVE 
SOME

[Captioner] 22:00:25
 DIMMING ON THE SIGN IN THE 
LATE

[Captioner] 22:00:28
 NIGHT HOURS AS PART OF 
THEIR ENERGY SAVING WHICH WILL

[Captioner] 22:00:32
 
HELP TO REDUCE THE BRIGHTNESS OF 
THE SIGN ALONG THE FREEWAY

[Captioner] 22:00:35
.


[Captioner] 22:00:38
>> Vice Mayor Keng:   GREAT, 
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 22:00:41
>> Mayor Mei:   COUNCILMEMBER 
COX.


[Captioner] 22:00:45
QUESTIONS?
>> Councilmember Cox:   YES.

[Captioner] 22:00:48

>> Mayor Mei:   YOU'RE UN-- 
THANK YOU

[Captioner] 22:00:52
.

[Captioner] 22:00:54

>> Councilmember Cox:   CAN YOU 
HEAR ME NOW?


[Captioner] 22:00:57
OKAY, THANK YOU.
WITH THE

[Captioner] 22:01:01
 SIGN I WANTED TO 
DOUBLE-CHECK, IS --

[Captioner] 22:01:04
 WHAT ARE THE 
COLORS OF THE SIGN?

[Captioner] 22:01:05

>> Mayor Mei:   BLACK AND 
YELLOW.


[Captioner] 22:01:08
>> Councilmember Cox:   I 
THOUGHT I SAW YELLOW OR BLACK

[Captioner] 22:01:11
.
>> THE SIGN CABINET IS BLACK, 
THE

[Captioner] 22:01:14
 TEXT ON THE SIGN IS YELLOW 
AS IS THEIR

[Captioner] 22:01:17
 LOGO AND I BELIEVE 
THERE IS WHITE WRITING AT THE

[Captioner] 22:01:20
 
BOTTOM, THE MACHINERY PART OF 
IT.


[Captioner] 22:01:23
>> Councilmember Cox:   OKAY, 
AND WITH THIS SIGN, IS

[Captioner] 22:01:26
 IT 
SOMETHING THAT THEY HAVE SECURED

[Captioner] 22:01:29
 
THE QUOTES AND THE PRICING TO 
LOCK DOWN

[Captioner] 22:01:33
 THIS PRICING AT THIS 
POINT?


[Captioner] 22:01:37
>> THAT WOULD ACTUALLY BE A 
QUESTION THE APPLICANT WOULD 
PROBABLY BE BETTER

[Captioner] 22:01:40
 AT ANSWERING 
THAN I WOULD BE.
>> Councilmember Cox:   OKAY.


[Captioner] 22:01:43
COULD WE HAVE THE APPLICANT --
>> 

[Captioner] 22:01:46
THE APPLICANT HAS A 
PRESENTATION, A TEN MINUTE 
PRESENTATION

[Captioner] 22:01:49
, ONCE COUNCIL'S 
FINISHED WITH YOUR QUESTIONS 
HERE.


[Captioner] 22:01:52
>> Councilmember Cox:   OKAY.
I'LL HOLD OFF ON THAT UNTIL

[Captioner] 22:01:55
 THE 
APPROPRIATE TIME.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 22:01:58
>> Mayor Mei:   OKAY NEXT

[Captioner] 22:02:00
 IS 
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN.
>> Councilmember Salwan:   THANK 


[Captioner] 22:02:04
YOU, MADAM MAYOR.
I NOTICED THAT THIS WAS 
COMPATIBLE WITH THE SIGN

[Captioner] 22:02:06
 
ORDINANCE.
SO WHAT COMPELS THIS TO COME 


[Captioner] 22:02:10
BEFORE PLANNING OR CITY COUNCIL?
I KNOW WHY IT COMES TO US, 
BECAUSE THEY

[Captioner] 22:02:13
 APPEALED IT.
BUT WHY DOES IT GO TO PLANNING 
COMMISSION?

[Captioner] 22:02:17

>> INDUSTRIAL SITES WITH A 
FREEWAY ORIENTED PYLON SIGN, THE

[Captioner] 22:02:20
 
PYLON SIGN REQUIRES A 
CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT.

[Captioner] 22:02:22

>> Councilmember Salwan:   OKAY, 
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 22:02:26
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.
COUNCILMEMBER SHAO.


[Captioner] 22:02:30
>> Councilmember Shao:   THANK 
YOU, MADAM MAYOR.
I

[Captioner] 22:02:33
 HEARD THAT BEFORE THE CASE WAS

[Captioner] 22:02:37
 
HEARD OR APPLICATION WAS HEARD 
BY

[Captioner] 22:02:40
 THE PLANNING COMMISSION, 
THERE WAS SOME SORT

[Captioner] 22:02:44
 OF A MOCK 
SIGN PUT UP.
>> Mayor Mei:  

[Captioner] 22:02:47
 IT'S STILT 
THERE.
>> Councilmember Shao:   AND

[Captioner] 22:02:50
 SO 
I HAVEN'T SEEN A PICTURE OF THE 
MOCK

[Captioner] 22:02:53
 SIGN.
SO IF THAT'S IN THE APPLICANT

[Captioner] 22:02:56
'S 
PRESENTATION, THEN I CAN 
CERTAINLY HOLD

[Captioner] 22:03:00
 MY QUESTION.
>> I BELIEVE THERE IS SOME

[Captioner] 22:03:03
 
PHOTOS OF THE TOWER THAT THEY 
CONSTRUCTED TO

[Captioner] 22:03:06
 SIMULATE THE 
HEIGHT OF THE SIGN.
THE SIGN -- THE

[Captioner] 22:03:09
 TOWER IS ONSITE 
RIGHT NOW.

[Captioner] 22:03:10

>> Councilmember Shao:   THANK 
YOU.


[Captioner] 22:03:15
>> Mayor Mei:   COUNCILMEMBER 
CAMPBELL.
>> Councilmember Campbell:   I 


[Captioner] 22:03:18
JUST HAVE ONE QUICK QUESTION.
I HEARD THAT

[Captioner] 22:03:21
 YOU SAID THAT THERE 
WAS SOME OVERHEAD UTILITY

[Captioner] 22:03:24
 LINES.

[Captioner] 22:03:28

OVER TOP OF THE SIGN ITSELF?
DOES

[Captioner] 22:03:31
 THAT PRESENT

[Captioner] 22:03:34
 A HAZARD IN 
TERMS OF FIRE OR DANGER OR

[Captioner] 22:03:37
 ANY 
WAY THAT THE SIGN COULD HIT

[Captioner] 22:03:41
 THE 
UTILITY LINES, TO CAUSE ANY TIME 
OF

[Captioner] 22:03:44
 DANGER?
>> THE PROPOSED SIGN IS LOCATED 
IN ONE

[Captioner] 22:03:47
 OF THE ONLY SPOTS ON THE 
REAR OF THE SITE THAT ACTUALLY 
IS NOT

[Captioner] 22:03:50
 CROSSED BY A UTILITY 
LINE.
MOST OF THE UTILITY LINES ARE

[Captioner] 22:03:54
 TO 
THE SOUTH.
THEY'RE LARGE HIGH

[Captioner] 22:03:57
 VOLTAGE POWER 
LINES THAT CROSS THE ENTIRE SITE 
AND TRAVEL ON

[Captioner] 22:04:00
 THROUGH FREMONT.
PG&E WAS CONSULTED

[Captioner] 22:04:03
 EARLY ON IN 
THE PROJECT, AND THEY HAD SOME 
RECOMMENDATION

[Captioner] 22:04:07
S IN THE SIGN 
LOCATION, I BELIEVE WAS 
RELOCATED A

[Captioner] 22:04:10
 FEW FEET TO GET IT 
JUST FAR ENOUGH AWAY SO

[Captioner] 22:04:13
 THAT 
CONSTRUCTION OF THE SIGN WOULD 
NOT BE -- NOT

[Captioner] 22:04:16
 REQUIRE SPECIAL 
CONSIDERATIONS FOR HIGH VOLTAGE 
POWER

[Captioner] 22:04:19
 LINES.
>> Councilmember Campbell:   AND

[Captioner] 22:04:22
 
THAT WOULD BE BOTH -- GO AHEAD, 
GO AHEAD.


[Captioner] 22:04:25
>> COUNCILMEMBER IF I MAY PAPE 
PRESIDENT

[Captioner] 22:04:29
 MIKE PATI DOES  HAVE

[Captioner] 22:04:32
 
THAT FIVE MINUTE PRESENTATION 
THAT I THINK WILL ADDRESS A LOT

[Captioner] 22:04:35
 
OF THE VISUALIZATION QUESTIONS 
THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED

[Captioner] 22:04:38
 HERE.
>> Councilmember Campbell:   
OKAY, I HAVE JUST

[Captioner] 22:04:42
 ANOTHER FOLLOW 
ON BECAUSE OF WHAT YOU JUST 
SAID,

[Captioner] 22:04:45
 WAS DURING THE 
CONSTRUCTION OF, OR THE

[Captioner] 22:04:48
 
PLACEMENT OF PUTTING IT UP,

[Captioner] 22:04:51
 THEY 
WON'T RUN INTO ANY CONCERNS 
ABOUT

[Captioner] 22:04:54
 THE OVERHEAD UTILITY LINES 
WHEN THEY'RE

[Captioner] 22:04:57
 CONSTRUCTING THE 
ACTUAL SIGN, BECAUSE I DID -- 
FOR SOME

[Captioner] 22:05:00
 REASON THAT STRUCK ME 
WHEN YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT THE 
OVER

[Captioner] 22:05:04
HEAD UTILITY LINES.
>> AS I RECALL THE

[Captioner] 22:05:07
 ISSUE PG&E 
HAD WAS THAT SPECIAL BONDING

[Captioner] 22:05:10
 
WOULD HAVE BEEN NECESSARY ON THE 
CRANE AS IT WAS

[Captioner] 22:05:14
 BEING ASSEMBLED 
BUT MOVING IT AWAY, MADE IT

[Captioner] 22:05:16
 FAR 
ENOUGH AWAY THAT THEY DIDN'T 
HAVE TO DO THAT.


[Captioner] 22:05:19
THE SIGN ITSELF WAS NEVER IN ANY 
ENVELOPE

[Captioner] 22:05:23
 OF DANGER FROM THE 
POWER LINES.
THEY WERE MORE CONCERNED ABOUT 


[Captioner] 22:05:26
THE ARM OF THE CRANE BEING TOO 
CLOSE TO THE POWER LINES AND 
THEY WOULD

[Captioner] 22:05:29
 HAVE TO USE SPECIAL 
GROUNDING TECHNIQUES

[Captioner] 22:05:33
 TO PROTECT 
THE CRANE OPERATOR AND

[Captioner] 22:05:36
 IT WAS  
DECIDED IT WAS BETTER TO

[Captioner] 22:05:40
 MOVE 
THE SIGN OVER

[Captioner] 22:05:41
.
>> Councilmember Campbell:   
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 22:05:44
>> Mayor Mei:   I HAD SOME 
CLARIFYING QUESTIONS BUT I KNOW

[Captioner] 22:05:48
 
THE APPLICANT WILL CLARIFY.
I HAD A

[Captioner] 22:05:51
 QUESTION ASKED AHEAD OF 
TIME THE OPERATING HOURS AND 
THEN ALSO

[Captioner] 22:05:54
 THE SENSITIVITY AND 
I'M SURE THE PRESENTATION WILL 
ANSWER THAT QUESTION ABOUT

[Captioner] 22:05:58
 THE 
NEIGHBORS AND WHETHER OR NOT, 
BECAUSE WE TRADITIONALLY

[Captioner] 22:06:01
 HAVEN'T 
HAD LIT SIGNS.
WHAT WE'VE HAD ALONG THE 


[Captioner] 22:06:04
CORRIDOR ARE ONES THAT ARE 
MOUNTED ON THE BUILDING SO THAT 

[Captioner] 22:06:08
 
WAS ONE OF THE QUESTIONS AND 
CONCERNS THAT WE

[Captioner] 22:06:11
 HAD.
WE RECOGNIZE THE LOT

[Captioner] 22:06:14
 HAS 
LIMITATIONS.
I'M MORE INTERESTED TO HAVE

[Captioner] 22:06:17
 
DIMMABLE OPTION, ONE IT IS FOR 
ENERGY EFFICIENCY.


[Captioner] 22:06:20
WE DON'T NEED TO HAVE IT 
OPERATING A

[Captioner] 22:06:23
 CERTAIN BRIGHTNESS 
AT CERTAIN HOURS ESPECIALLY FOR 
RESIDENTS

[Captioner] 22:06:27
 AND THEN 2 JUST FOR 
THE ENERGY SAVINGS.
I APPRECIATE AND

[Captioner] 22:06:30
 I LOOK FORWARD 
TO HEARING THE QUESTION BUT I 
THINK THAT'S PROBABLY

[Captioner] 22:06:33
 MAYBE IN 
REFERENCE TO THE COMMENTS OR 
QUESTIONS I HAD EARLIER

[Captioner] 22:06:36
.
SO WITH THAT WE'VE ASKED

[Captioner] 22:06:40
 OUR 
QUESTIONS AND I'D LIKE TO INVITE 
THE

[Captioner] 22:06:43
 APPLICANT, APPELLANT UP TO 
PROVIDE THEIR TEN

[Captioner] 22:06:46
 MINUTE 
PRESENTATION.
AND I THINK YOU HAVE

[Captioner] 22:06:50
 --
>> YES, MADAM MAYOR, WE ARE 
GOING TO SHARE THE PRESENTATION

[Captioner] 22:06:53
 
HERE FROM OUR ZOOM SCREENS.
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE

[Captioner] 22:06:56
 THE 
APPLICANT COME UP HERE.
WE'VE RECEIVED SOME

[Captioner] 22:06:59
 FEED BACK 
THERE CITY STAFF THAT ARE ON 
ZOOM THAT WE'RE HAVING

[Captioner] 22:07:02
 SOME 
ISSUES WITH THE MICROPHONE UP 
HERE AT THE LECTERN

[Captioner] 22:07:06
.
SO THAT'S WHY WE'RE HAVING THEM 
COME DOWN HERE

[Captioner] 22:07:09
.
IT'S NOT NORMAL PROTOCOL, WE'LL

[Captioner] 22:07:12
 
HAVE THEM COME DOWN AND TAKE 
CARE OF THE ADVANCE

[Captioner] 22:07:15
ING SLIDES.
>> Mayor Mei:   OKAY, THANK YOU.
SO WELCOME IF YOU WOULD

[Captioner] 22:07:19
 LIKE TO 
INTRODUCE YOURSELF AND THEN ALSO 
I THINK

[Captioner] 22:07:22

QUICK HISTORY OF WHERE WE HAVE

I WANTED TO SWITCH THEN TO 
TALKING ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF

IN 2018 WE DONATED

[Captioner] 22:10:12
 TO THE 
COALITION TO PROTECT LOCAL 
TRANSPORTATION IMPROVEMENT WHICH 


[Captioner] 22:10:15
WAS TOMORROW TO FIGHT 
PROPOSITION 6 WHICH WAS A

[Captioner] 22:10:18
 
MEASURE THAT ATTEMPTED TO REPEAL

[Captioner] 22:10:21
 
THE ROAD REPAIR AND 
ACCOUNTABILITY ACT WHICH IS A

[Captioner] 22:10:23
 
MAJOR INFRASTRUCTURE INITIATIVE 
FOR CALIFORNIA.


[Captioner] 22:10:27
WE ALSO WORK WITH SERVICE MEMBER 
ORGANIZATION

[Captioner] 22:10:30
S AND FIRST 
RESPONDER ORGANIZATIONS

[Captioner] 22:10:33
, WE 
SUPPORT TROOPS

[Captioner] 22:10:36
 DIRECT, COPS 
DIRECT WE SUPPORT OUR LOCAL 
POLICE DEPARTMENT IN

[Captioner] 22:10:39
 OUR CURRENT 
JURISDICTION OF NEWARK AND AS 
DONOVAN MENTION

[Captioner] 22:10:42
ED WE'RE ALREADY 
A SIGNIFICANT TAX GENERATOR FOR

[Captioner] 22:10:45
 
THE CITY OF FREMONT, AND THE NEW 
OPERATION

[Captioner] 22:10:48
, ONCE IT OPENS, BRINGS 
A SIMILAR AMOUNT

[Captioner] 22:10:52
 OF TAX 
GENERATION AS OUR CURRENT 
OPERATION DOWN

[Captioner] 22:10:55
 ON CATO ROAD 
DOES, SO WE LOOK FORWARD

[Captioner] 22:10:58
 TO 
MOVING UP THAT LIST IN THE NEAR 
FUTURE.


[Captioner] 22:11:01
AS ALSO MENTIONED BY JAMES AND 
DONOVAN WE'RE A

[Captioner] 22:11:04
 SERVICE PROVIDER 
AND EQUIPMENT PROVIDER FOR MOST 
IF NOT ALL

[Captioner] 22:11:07
 OF THE LOCAL 
UTILITIES AND PUBLIC WORKS

[Captioner] 22:11:10
-OS IN 
MANY CITIES.


[Captioner] 22:11:13
NEXT SLIDE PLEASE.
THE QUICK

[Captioner] 22:11:16
 HISTORY OF OUR PROCESS 
JAMES WENT THROUGH

[Captioner] 22:11:19
 AND WE 
LISTENED TO THE COMMISSION'S 
FEEDBACK FROM OUR FIRST MEETING

[Captioner] 22:11:23
, 
TOOK IT UNDER ADVISEMENT AND 
REVISED

[Captioner] 22:11:26
 THE SQUARE FOOTAGE AND 
HEIGHT OF OUR SIGN.
AND IN THE

[Captioner] 22:11:29
 SECOND PLANNING 
COMMISSION, AGAIN THEY DENIED IT 
CITE

[Captioner] 22:11:33
ING PRECEDENT, PROXIMITY TO 
THE 680 CORRIDOR

[Captioner] 22:11:35
 AND THE 
POTENTIAL OR THE LIGHT 
POLLUTION.


[Captioner] 22:11:38
NEXT SLIDE PLEASE.
I'D LIKE TO SHARE THE OBJECTIVE 
OF OUR

[Captioner] 22:11:41
 SIGN.
THE PAPE SIGN IS DESIGNED TO 
BLEND

[Captioner] 22:11:45
 INTO OUR SURROUNDINGS AND 
TO REPRESENT OUR BUSINESS.


[Captioner] 22:11:48
WE DON'T WANT TO STAND OUT.
WE WANT TO FIT INTO THE MOSAIC

[Captioner] 22:11:51
 
OF THE CITY AROUND US.
OBVIOUSLY WHAT APPEALS TO

[Captioner] 22:11:54
 US 
ABOUT HAVING A PYLON SIGN ON

[Captioner] 22:11:57
 I 
680 IS NORTH

[Captioner] 22:12:01
 OF 150,000 VEHICLES 
A DAY PASS BY THE SITE THAT

[Captioner] 22:12:04
 WE 
OCCUPY.
NEXT SLIDE PLEASE.

[Captioner] 22:12:06

THIS IS WHAT'S REALLY CRITICAL 
TO US.


[Captioner] 22:12:09
CONSUMERS MAKE DETERMINATIONS 
ABOUT THE QUALITY OF THE 
BUSINESS BASED ON ITS

[Captioner] 22:12:12
 SIGNS.
AND THE STUDY THAT WE USE

[Captioner] 22:12:16
 SHOWS 
THAT FOR EACH ADDITIONAL SIGN 
NOT JUST A PYLON SIGN BUT

[Captioner] 22:12:19
 FOR 
EACH ADDITIONAL BUILDING SIGN

[Captioner] 22:12:22
 
SALES DOLLARS ARE EXPECTED TO 
INCREASE BY NEARLY 5%

[Captioner] 22:12:26
.
SO THEY CAN HAVE A DRAMATIC 
IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS AND

[Captioner] 22:12:29
 OUR 
TAX GENERATION.
FOR A STORE WITH 500,000 OF

[Captioner] 22:12:32
 
SALES PER YEAR THAT'S $23,7

[Captioner] 22:12:36
50 IN 
ADDITIONAL REVENUES PER SIGN.

[Captioner] 22:12:39

OUR BUSINESS IS MANY TIMES THAT 
ANNUAL REVENUE

[Captioner] 22:12:42
.
SO IT'S MUCH MORE SIGNIFICANT 
IMPACT FOR US.

[Captioner] 22:12:45

ONE KEY FACTOR TO SIGN

[Captioner] 22:12:49
 IS IF 
THEY'RE TOO INSTALL OR

[Captioner] 22:12:52
 ILLEGIBLE 
IT CAN REPRESENT A MISS

[Captioner] 22:12:55
ED 
OPPORTUNITY AS CONSUMERS

[Captioner] 22:12:58
 DRIVE 
PAST.
NEXT SLIDE

[Captioner] 22:13:01
 PLEASE.
EMOTIONAL HALF CONSUMERS DROVE

[Captioner] 22:13:05
 
BY AND FAILED TO FIND A BUSINESS 
BECAUSE OF IN

[Captioner] 22:13:08
ADEQUATE SIGNAGE 
THAT WAS TOO SMALL AND UN

[Captioner] 22:13:11
CLEAR.
THEY HAVE BEEN DRAWN INTO STORES 
BECAUSE OF THE QUALITY

[Captioner] 22:13:15
 OF THEIR 
SIGNS AND TWO OUT OF THREE

[Captioner] 22:13:18
 
CUSTOMERS MADE QUALITY DECISIONS

[Captioner] 22:13:21
 
AS TO WHETHER THAT COMPANY HAS 
CLEAR AND

[Captioner] 22:13:24
 ATTRACTIVE SIGNS.
>> Planner Pullen:   YOU CAN SEE 
THE COLOR OF THE SCHEME THAT WAS

[Captioner] 22:13:26
 
ASKED ABOUT IN ONE OF 
COUNCILMEMBERS QUESTIONS.


[Captioner] 22:13:30
LETTERS THAT ARE LARGE EVENLY 
SPACED EASILY READABLE

[Captioner] 22:13:33
, HIGH 
CRAFT COLORS, THE YELLOW

[Captioner] 22:13:36
 FOR THE 
PAPE LOGO AND THE WHITE FOR

[Captioner] 22:13:39
 THE 
MACHINERY LABEL, THEY PROVIDE

[Captioner] 22:13:42
 
RECOGNITION AND THOSE ARE THE 
CRITICAL FACTORS FOR CUSTOMERS

[Captioner] 22:13:46
 
PASSING BY.
WHAT CUSTOMERS SAY MAKES A

[Captioner] 22:13:49
 SIGN 
DIFFICULT TO READ AND THEREFORE 
NOT GOOD FOR

[Captioner] 22:13:52
 BUSINESS GENERATION 
ARE LETTERS THAT ARE TOO SMALL, 
POOR PLACEMENT

[Captioner] 22:13:55
 AND NOT 
SUFFICIENTLY LIT AT NIGHT, THOSE 
ARE THE KEY CRITERIA

[Captioner] 22:13:59
.
NEXT SLIDE PLEASE.


[Captioner] 22:14:03
SIGN HEIGHT AND SIZE WE TALKED 
ABOUT.
WE DID LISTEN TO PLANNING 


[Captioner] 22:14:06
COMMISSION'S CONCERNS.
AND LOWERED OUR

[Captioner] 22:14:10
 SIGN HEIGHT AND 
SQUARE FOOTAGE.
CAN YOU SEE IT

[Captioner] 22:14:13
 IN THE RENDERING 
IN THE RIGHT WITH THE CONCRETE 
WALL OF THE FREEWAY

[Captioner] 22:14:16
 BARRIER ON 
THE RIGHT-HAND SIDE.
NEXT SLIDE PLEASE

[Captioner] 22:14:19
.
THESE ARE SOME PHOTO VIEWS OF 
WHAT THE SIGN

[Captioner] 22:14:22
 WOULD LOOK LIKE IN 
THE NEIGHBORHOOD.
OUR PHOTO SURVEY SHOWED THAT

[Captioner] 22:14:25
 
NONE OF THE HOMES ON THE HILL 
ACROSS FROM 680 IN THE

[Captioner] 22:14:29
 IMMEDIATE 
VICINITY HAVE A VIEW OF THE 
PROPERTY DUE TO TALL

[Captioner] 22:14:32
 CONCRETE 
NOISE BARRIERS HILLS TREES OR 
DISTANCE.


[Captioner] 22:14:35
THE PHOTO ON THE LEFT SHOWS THE 
CONCRETE WALL AS IT PROTECTS

[Captioner] 22:14:37
 THE 
RESIDENTS.
IT IS ABOUT HALFWAY UP THE 


[Captioner] 22:14:40
PHOTO.
SO VERY LITTLE VISIBILITY FROM 
THE SITE THAT IS LOOK

[Captioner] 22:14:43
ING UP FROM 
THE SITE.
IN THE MIDDLE FROM THE TOP OF 


[Captioner] 22:14:47
THE HILL BY THE ROW HOMES THAT 
SIT ATOP THE HILL AND YOU

[Captioner] 22:14:50
 CAN 
SEE THAT WE HAVE RENDERED IN 
WHERE THE SIGN POEM

[Captioner] 22:14:53
 WOULD BE A 
LITTLE CIRCLE IN RED AND WE'VE 
HAD

[Captioner] 22:14:56
 TO ZOOM IN WITH THE INSET SO 
CAN YOU SEE THE EDGE PROFILE

[Captioner] 22:14:59
 OF 
THE SIGN.
SO VERY, VERY LIMITED VISIBILITY

[Captioner] 22:15:02

VISIBILITY.
AND IMPORTANTLY IN THE 


[Captioner] 22:15:05
RIGHT-HAND PHOTO YOU CAN SEE THE 
EDGE PROFILE OF OUR SIGN

[Captioner] 22:15:08
.
THE LEGS ARE WHAT IS VISIBLE

[Captioner] 22:15:11
 
FROM DIRECTLY ACROSS THE ROAD, 
NOT THE SIGN

[Captioner] 22:15:15
 CABINET ITSELF.
NEXT

[Captioner] 22:15:18
 SLIDE PLEASE.
AS FAR AS LIGHT POLLUTION, I'M 
GOING TO

[Captioner] 22:15:21
 START FROM THE 
RIGHT-HAND SIDE OF THE SCREEN 
AND TALK

[Captioner] 22:15:24
 ABOUT DIMMING.
OUR SIGN IS DESIGNED TO OPERATE

[Captioner] 22:15:27
 
AT 375 WATTS WHICH IS ONE FOURTH 
OF WHAT CODE

[Captioner] 22:15:31
 DESIGNS US TO DO.
BY NATURE WE DESIGN OUR

[Captioner] 22:15:34
 SIGNS TO 
SUBMIT A SUBDUED GLOW, ALREADY

[Captioner] 22:15:37
 
75% BELOW WHAT WE'RE ALLOWED TO 
DO.


[Captioner] 22:15:40
WE DID TALK TO SEVERAL 
COUNCILMEMBERS IN ADVANCE AND 
THE SIGN IS DIM

[Captioner] 22:15:43
MABLE.
WE CAN DIM IT TO 65% AT CERTAIN

[Captioner] 22:15:46
 
INTERVALS AFTER CLOSE OF 
BUSINESS AND BEFORE START OF 


[Captioner] 22:15:50
BUSINESS.
AND YOU CAN SEE THAT ON THE 
BOTTOM RIGHT

[Captioner] 22:15:53
, THAT'S OUR SIGN, 
AT 375

[Captioner] 22:15:56
 WATTS AS COMPARED TO A 
NORMAL D.O.T.

[Captioner] 22:15:59
 FREEWAY SIGN.
THEY ARE ABOUT ONE FOURTH THE 
LIGHT

[Captioner] 22:16:03
 THAT IS GIVEN OFF FROM 
FREEWAY SIGNS.
SO WHILE WE

[Captioner] 22:16:06
 ARE DEFINITELY 
WILLING TO DIM TO 65%, WE WOULD

[Captioner] 22:16:09
 
ASK FOR CONSIDERATION, GIVEN OUR 
LOW LIGHTING LEVEL

[Captioner] 22:16:12
 AS IS, TO 
RETAIN A SINGLE LIGHT LEVEL ALL 
NIGHT.


[Captioner] 22:16:16
NEXT SLIDE PLEASE.

[Captioner] 22:16:20

THE ZONING AS JAMES AND DONOVAN

[Captioner] 22:16:24
 
MENTIONED, THERE'S ONLY ONE AREA 
OF I 6

[Captioner] 22:16:27
80 PROPERTIES THAT IS 
ZONED INDUSTRIAL AND CAN FIT 
THIS KIND

[Captioner] 22:16:30
 OF SIGN.
IT'S IN LIGHT BLUE AND THERE ARE

[Captioner] 22:16:33
 
ABOUT TEN PARCELS THAT FRONT THE 
FREEWAY.


[Captioner] 22:16:36
OURS IS THE ONLY UNDEVELOPED ONE

[Captioner] 22:16:39
 
AND, AS MENTIONED, THE OARL 
PARCELS ARE MATURE

[Captioner] 22:16:43
 AND OF THE 
FEW REMAINING PROPERTIES

[Captioner] 22:16:45
 THAT 
ARE SIMILARLY ZONED IT IS 
UNLIKELY THAT OUR NEIGHBORS 


[Captioner] 22:16:49
WOULD WANT TO INVEST THE 
APPROXIMATELY $200,000 REQUIRED

[Captioner] 22:16:53
 
TO ENTITLE AND CONSTRUCT A FREE 
STANDING SIGN.


[Captioner] 22:16:56
NEXT SLIDE PLEASE.
AS MENTIONED OUR NEIGHBORS HAVE 
NO OBJECTION

[Captioner] 22:16:59
 TO OUR PROPOSAL FOR 
A PYLON SIGN

[Captioner] 22:17:03
.
CRISP COMPANY

 WAS SUPPORTIVE AS 
WAS THE ASSEMBLY

[Captioner] 22:17:10
 OF JEHOVAH'S 
WITNESSES.
AS

[Captioner] 22:17:13
 WAS PUBLIC COMMENT.
NEXT SLIDE PLEASE.
THESE ARE SIX SLIDES

[Captioner] 22:17:17
 OR FIVE 
SLIDES THAT SHOW THE SIGN AS 
VIEWED FROM THE FREEWAY

[Captioner] 22:17:19
.
THIS IS SOUTH END OF THE 
PROPERTY.

TYPE AND

[Captioner] 22:17:50
 DENSITY OF OUR PROPOSED 
USE AND THE SIGN ITSELF HAS BEEN 
APPROVED

[Captioner] 22:20:45
 
FLAGSHIP FACILITY.
YOU'VE BEEN GIVEN MANY DETAILS

[Captioner] 22:20:48
 
AND REASONS WHY THIS SHOULD BE 
APPROVED AND I THINK ONE THING

[Captioner] 22:20:51
 
THAT'S IMPORTANT TO ADD IS HOW 
PAPE HAS RESPONDED

[Captioner] 22:20:54
, CONDUCT ID 
ITSELF AND WHAT IT

[Captioner] 22:20:58
 BRINGS TO THE 
TABLE IN THIS WHOLE PACKAGE.

 FROM 
PLANNING COMMISSION, THEY HAVE 
PROMPTLY MADE NECESSARY

[Captioner] 22:21:04
 CHANGES 
TO BE COMPLIANT WITH ORDINANCES 
AND THEY HAVE REACHED OUT TO

[Captioner] 22:21:07
 
THEIR NEIGHBORS TO GAIN THEIR 
SUPPORT AS WELL.

WE HAVE HEARD THAT ACCORDING TO

[Captioner] 22:22:08
>> SO IF YOU LOOK AT HOW THESE

[Captioner] 22:22:11
 
MASSIVE

[Captioner] 22:22:15
 ELECTRONIC CHANGEABLE 
FREEWAY SIGNS ARE

[Captioner] 22:22:19
 BEING PROPOSED 
AND

[Captioner] 22:22:23
 APPROVED AT THE ALAMEDA 
COUNTY LEVEL,

[Captioner] 22:22:26
 IT'S VERY 
LEGALISTIC.
THERE'S A HUGE TRAIL WORK

[Captioner] 22:22:30
 OF 
LAWS THAT GOVERN THESE FREEWAY 
SIGNS

[Captioner] 22:22:33
.
AND IT'S

[Captioner] 22:22:37
 BEEN AROUND FOR LIKE 50 
YEARS OR

[Captioner] 22:22:40
 NOR.
AND YOU CAN'T DO THE SEAT OF THE 
FANTS.

[Captioner] 22:22:46
 OF THE 
PANTS.
YOU CAN'T BRING

[Captioner] 22:22:50
 ESTHETIC 
JUDGMENTS TO YOUR PLANNING 
COMMISSION.


[Captioner] 22:22:53
THE KEY WORDS HERE ARE THE 
SENIOR CORRIDORS

[Captioner] 22:22:56
 THAT THEY PUT 
IN AND THE LANDSCAPED FREEWAY 
DESIGNATION

[Captioner] 22:23:00
S.
AND IT'S

[Captioner] 22:23:03
 VERY LEGALISTIC AND 
DOESN'T APPLY HERE, YOU GO

[Captioner] 22:23:06
 DOWN 
THE FREEWAY AND WHEREVER IT'S

[Captioner] 22:23:09
 
OUTLAWED YOU CAN'T PUT IN SIGNS.
BUT THIS

[Captioner] 22:23:13
 SIGN MEETS THE 
CRITERIA.

[Captioner] 22:23:17

BUT, YOU KNOW, THEN YOUR 
PLANNING COMMISSION,

[Captioner] 22:23:20
 YOU BRING 
THEIR SUBJECTIVE ESTHETIC

[Captioner] 22:23:23
 
JUDGMENTS, THEY BRING THEIR 
POLITICAL PREFERENCES, THEY 


[Captioner] 22:23:26
BRING THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD 
AFFILIATIONS, AND THEY THROW

[Captioner] 22:23:30
 OUT 
THOSE THINGS ON THAT SLIDE ABOUT

[Captioner] 22:23:33
 
KNOCKING DOWN THIS PROPOSAL, AND 
IT DOESN'T

[Captioner] 22:23:36
 MAKE ANY SENSE 
LEGALLY.
AND IF YOU WANT

[Captioner] 22:23:39
 TO, YOU KNOW, 
YOU WANT TO BEAT YOUR

[Captioner] 22:23:42
 HEAD 
AGAINST THE WALL AND HAVE -- 
WASTE YOUR LAWYER'S TIME YOU

[Captioner] 22:23:45
 CAN 
GO AHEAD AND DENY THIS THING AND 
SEE HOW IT DOES IN COURT AND

[Captioner] 22:23:49
 IT 
WILL DO VERY WELL, THE SLIDE 
WILL SURVIVE AND

[Captioner] 22:23:53
 THE DENIALS 
WILL GET CHOPPED DOWN.

[Captioner] 22:23:56

YOU MIGHT AS WELL SAVE EVERYBODY 
TROUBLE AND

[Captioner] 22:23:59
 GO AHEAD AND APPROVE 
THIS SIGN, APPROVE THE APPEAL OR 
DENY

[Captioner] 22:24:03
 -- YES, APPROVE THE APPEAL, 
WHATEVER, APPROVE

[Captioner] 22:24:06
 THIS SIGN 
BECAUSE THIS THING LEGAL

[Captioner] 22:24:09
LY 
DOESN'T HOLD ANY WATER.
IT IS A RIDICULOUS DECISION.


[Captioner] 22:24:12
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE, YOU KNOW, 
PEOPLE THAT JUST BRING IN

[Captioner] 22:24:15
 -- 
THEY'RE USED TO, YOU KNOW, 
APPLYING THE -- APPROVE

[Captioner] 22:24:19
ING HOUSES 
OR APARTMENT BUILDINGS OR 
SOMETHING AND THEY KEEP BRINGING

[Captioner] 22:24:22
 
THIS MINDSET OF OH YEAH THIS IS 
HOW

[Captioner] 22:24:26
 WE TREAT PROJECTS.
THAT'S NOT HOW YOU TREAT 
PROJECTS.

[Captioner] 22:24:29

YOU TREAT PROJECTS ACCORDING TO 
DIFFERING SETS OF LAWS.

[Captioner] 22:24:32

THIS SET OF LAWS IS VERY 
FAVORABLE TO THIS SIGN.


[Captioner] 22:24:35
SO THIS SIGN IS, YOU KNOW,

[Captioner] 22:24:39
 
PRETTY BULLET PROOF AND HAVING 
THIS PLANNING COMMISSION TRY TO

[Captioner] 22:24:42
 
SHOOT IT DOWN IS

[Captioner] 22:24:46
 A VAIN AND 
LOSING EFFORT.

[Captioner] 22:24:49

IT REFLECTS BADLY ON THE 
PLANNING COMMISSION.


[Captioner] 22:24:52
AND, YOU KNOW, THIS PROJECT 
NEEDS TO BE APPROVED.
THANKS.


[Captioner] 22:25:01
>> Mayor Mei:   ARE THERE OTHER 
SPEAKERS?
>> The Clerk:   NO

[Captioner] 22:25:04
 MA'AM.
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.
AT THIS TIME I'M GOING TO CLOSE 


[Captioner] 22:25:07
THE PUBLIC HEARING.
AND SO I'M GOING TO TURN IT BACK

[Captioner] 22:25:11
 
TO THE COUNCIL

[Captioner] 22:25:14
 FOR ANY QUESTIONS 
OR

[Captioner] 22:25:18
 COMMENTS AT THIS TIME.
>> The Clerk:   CONSUME, MADAM 
MAYOR,

[Captioner] 22:25:21
 THE APPLICANT HAS A FIVE 
MINUTE --
>> Mayor Mei:   I'M SORRY YES

[Captioner] 22:25:24
.
>> The Clerk:   THE APPLICANT 
HAS FIVE MINUTES FOR REBUTTAL IF 


[Captioner] 22:25:27
THEY SO USE.
>> Mayor Mei:   WOULD YOU LIKE 
TO UTILIZE THAT

[Captioner] 22:25:30
?
>> NO COMMENTS, THANKS.
>> Mayor Mei:   OKAY.


[Captioner] 22:25:33
THANK YOU.
AND SO I'D LIKE TO TURN IT BACK 
TO THE

[Captioner] 22:25:36
 COUNCIL FOR A 
CONVERSATION, I FIRST SEE 
COUNCILMEMBER KENG.


[Captioner] 22:25:44
>> Vice Mayor Keng:   THANK YOU, 
MADAM MAYOR.
SO FIRST OF ALL, I

[Captioner] 22:25:47
 WANT TO SHARE 
MY APPRECIATION OF PAPE CHOOSING

[Captioner] 22:25:50
 
TREATMENT TO INVEST IN.
AND ALSO

[Captioner] 22:25:53
, I'M GLAD THAT YOU GUYS 
DON'T HAVE TO COME BACK A

[Captioner] 22:25:56
 SECOND 
TIME.
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, WE RESOLVE 


[Captioner] 22:25:59
THE ISSUES EARLIER.
SO I KNOW THAT, YOU KNOW,

[Captioner] 22:26:02
 A LOT 
OF TIMES ALONG FREEWAYS, YOU SEE 
SIGNAGE

[Captioner] 22:26:06
 FOR SHOPPING CENTERS, IS 
WHERE PEOPLE CAN

[Captioner] 22:26:09
 IDENTIFY WHERE 
THE SHOPPING CENTERS ARE AT

[Captioner] 22:26:13
.
AND THEY CAN SHOP THERE.

[Captioner] 22:26:16

AND THIS, I THINK THIS APPLY BY 
THE SAME MEANS

[Captioner] 22:26:19
, AND YOU ALSO HAD 
PROVIDED A LOT OF DATA, HOW

[Captioner] 22:26:22
 
SIGNAGE OR GOOD LOOKING SIGNAGE 
CAN

[Captioner] 22:26:26
 ATTRACT, YOU KNOW, NEW 
BUSINESS.
AND SO

[Captioner] 22:26:29
, YOU KNOW, I APPRECIATE 
THAT YOU GUYS

[Captioner] 22:26:33
 CHOOSE FREMONT TO 
SET UP SHOP AND BRING

[Captioner] 22:26:36
 EMPLOYMENT 
OPPORTUNITIES HERE.
AND ALSO, YOU KNOW, WE WANT TO 


[Captioner] 22:26:39
MAKE SURE THAT OUR LOCAL 
BUSINESSES CAN DO

[Captioner] 22:26:43
 WELL AND 
CONTINUE TO THRIVE INTO THE 
FUTURE.

[Captioner] 22:26:46

AND I THINK THAT, YOU KNOW, YOUR 
PROPOSED

[Captioner] 22:26:50
 USE SIGNAGE WITH THE 
REDUCED HEIGHT AND REDUCED

[Captioner] 22:26:53
 AREA, 
DIM LIGHTING, AND, YOU KNOW, A

[Captioner] 22:26:56
 
LOT LOWER IN LIGHTING OF THE

[Captioner] 22:26:59
 
REQUIREMENT.
AND I THINK

[Captioner] 22:27:03
 IT'S CONSISTENT, IT 
IS CONSISTENT WITH THE GENERAL 
PLAN AND THE

[Captioner] 22:27:06
 APPLICABLE ZONING.
SO I WILL BE SUPPORTIVE

[Captioner] 22:27:10
 OF THE 
APPEAL.


[Captioner] 22:27:15
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.
NEXT IS COUNCILMEMBER SHAO.


[Captioner] 22:27:19
>> Councilmember Shao:   THANK 
YOU, MADAM MAYOR

[Captioner] 22:27:22
.
THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION.
I HAVE

[Captioner] 22:27:26
 TO APOLOGIZE THAT I, THAT 
DUE TO MY BUSY

[Captioner] 22:27:30
 SCHEDULE I DIDN'T 
HAVE A CHANCE TO MEET WITH THE 
APPLICANT IN ADVANCE

[Captioner] 22:27:33
.
SO I WAS EXPECTING TO

[Captioner] 22:27:36
 GET MORE 
INFORMATION TODAY TO ADDRESS

[Captioner] 22:27:39
 
SOME OF MY CONCERNS.
BUT EVEN BEFORE THAT

[Captioner] 22:27:42
, I READ THE 
COMMENTS FROM THE

[Captioner] 22:27:45
 PLANNING 
COMMISSION.
AND SINCE I

[Captioner] 22:27:49
 WAS LIVING NEARBY, 
EVEN THOUGH

[Captioner] 22:27:52
 YOUR COMPANY IS 
LOCATED IN DISTRICT 6, I BELIEVE

[Captioner] 22:27:56

BELIEVE, I USE THAT PART OF THE 
680 ALL THE TIME

[Captioner] 22:27:59
.
SO I DROVE BY SEVERAL TIMES

[Captioner] 22:28:02
 IN 
BOTH DIRECTIONS.

[Captioner] 22:28:06

AND IT TURNED OUT THAT AT

[Captioner] 22:28:09
 LEAST 
THE SUFFICIENT SIGNAGE

[Captioner] 22:28:13
 ARGUMENT 
IS

[Captioner] 22:28:17
 OUTSTANDING.
I TRIED TO JUST LOOK AT THE

[Captioner] 22:28:20
 TOP 
OF YOUR BUILDING WHEN I'M

[Captioner] 22:28:23
 
DRIVING SOUTHBOUND.
AND IT WAS SO HARD

[Captioner] 22:28:27
 TO SEE THE 
TOP OF YOUR BUILDING, BECAUSE OF 
THE DENSE

[Captioner] 22:28:30
 TREES, IN THE NEARBY 
LOT

[Captioner] 22:28:34
, AND ALSO

[Captioner] 22:28:37
, I DON'T THINK THE

[Captioner] 22:28:40
 
CONCERN FOR SETTING A

[Captioner] 22:28:43
 PRECEDENT 
IS VALID THERE.
THE

[Captioner] 22:28:46
 ONLY CONCERN I HAD WAS THE 
LIGHT POLLUTION.
BECAUSE THERE WAS

[Captioner] 22:28:49
 NO WAY FOR ME 
TO DO SUCH A STUDY.

[Captioner] 22:28:52

AND I'M VERY GLAD THAT THE DATA 
YOU

[Captioner] 22:28:56
 PRESENTED CERTAINLY WOULD 
ADDRESS THAT CONCERN OF MINE

[Captioner] 22:29:01
.
AND CONSIDERING

[Captioner] 22:29:04
 THAT THE 
COMMUNITY ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE

[Captioner] 22:29:07
 
OF -- ACROSS THE 680 WAS

[Captioner] 22:29:10
 BEHIND 
THE WALL

[Captioner] 22:29:14
, AND ALSO

[Captioner] 22:29:19
 THE LIGHT 
POLLUTION IS

[Captioner] 22:29:22
 ALREADY 
DEMONSTRATED IN YOUR 
PRESENTATION TO BE

[Captioner] 22:29:25
 LOW, AFTER 
YOU HAVE ALREADY INTRODUCED

[Captioner] 22:29:30
 A 
DIMMING MECHANISM.
I

[Captioner] 22:29:33
 THINK IT CERTAINLY 
SUFFICIENTLY ADDRESSED MY

[Captioner] 22:29:36
 
CONCERN.
SO I'M VERY SUPPORTIVE

[Captioner] 22:29:40
 TO YOUR 
BUSINESS AROUND ALSO

[Captioner] 22:29:47
 AND ALSO I HOPE THAT 
SETTING UP THE SIGN WOULD HELP

[Captioner] 22:29:50
 
YOU BE MORE SUCCESSFUL IN YOUR

[Captioner] 22:29:54
 
BUSINESS HENCE

[Captioner] 22:29:57
 BOOSTING THE 
LOCAL ECONOMY.
THANK YOU SO MUCH, THANK YOU 


[Captioner] 22:30:00
AGAIN FOR CHOOSING FREMONT AS 
HOME TO HELP

[Captioner] 22:30:04
 CREATE LOCAL JOBS 
AND

[Captioner] 22:30:06
 GENERATE TAX REVENUES FOR 
THE CITY.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 22:30:12
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.
NEXT IS COUNCILMEMBER COX.


[Captioner] 22:30:18
>> Councilmember Cox:   GOOD 
AFTERNOON OR GOOD EVENING.


[Captioner] 22:30:23
CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW?
>> Mayor Mei:   YES.
>> Commissioner Yee:   OKAY, 


[Captioner] 22:30:26
GREAT.
FIRST I WANT TO THANK YOU SO 
MUCH FOR

[Captioner] 22:30:30
 YOUR MAINTAINING LONG 
STANDING BUSINESS IN FREMONT AND 
ESPECIALLY

[Captioner] 22:30:33
 IN DISTRICT 6, THE 
SENSATIONAL 6 THAT I REPRESENT

[Captioner] 22:30:36
.
BUT OF COURSE I REPRESENT ALL OF 
FREMONT

[Captioner] 22:30:39
.
I THINK THAT THE ITEMS THAT

[Captioner] 22:30:43
 YOU 
PROVIDE TO THE COMMUNITY IS BEEN

[Captioner] 22:30:46
 
A COMMUNITY BENEFIT, WHETHER 
IT'S FOR THE

[Captioner] 22:30:49
 SPLICE TO KEEP OUR 
SCHOOLS OR HOSPITALS GOING, ALSO

[Captioner] 22:30:52
 
TO HELP IN OUR BUDGET, TO BE 
ABLE TO DO THINGS

[Captioner] 22:30:56
 BACK AND 
SUPPORT THE RESIDENTS IN THE 
CITY BY

[Captioner] 22:30:59
 BEING A STRONG TAX

[Captioner] 22:31:02
 BASE 
FOR THE CITY OF FREMONT.
ONE OF THE

[Captioner] 22:31:06
 THINGS THAT I WANTED 
TO UNDERSTAND A

[Captioner] 22:31:09
 LITTLE BIT, 
COMING FROM AN ENGINEERING 
BACKGROUND

[Captioner] 22:31:13
, IS WITH THE -- AND 
MAYBE THIS

[Captioner] 22:31:16
 COULD BE A TWO-PART 
WITH CITY STAFF, AND AS WELL AS

[Captioner] 22:31:20
 
THE APPLICANT -- TRYING TO

[Captioner] 22:31:24
 
UNDERSTAND WITH THE SIGN AND I 
KNOW YOU WENT DOWN IN SIZE

[Captioner] 22:31:27
.
THE HEIGHT AND ALSO

[Captioner] 22:31:30
 IN THE 
DIMENSIONS, I WAS TRYING TO 
UNDERSTAND, IS THAT

[Captioner] 22:31:34
 THE MAXIMUM 
AMOUNT THAT YOUR SIGN COULD BE

[Captioner] 22:31:37
, 
OR WAS THAT ON THE MINIMUM 
AMOUNT THAT YOUR SIGN

[Captioner] 22:31:40
 WAS 
DESIGNED?
AND THAT WAS THE HEIGHT WEBSITE

[Captioner] 22:31:43
 
DOWN TO 35, AND THEN THE AREA

[Captioner] 22:31:47
 
WENT DOWN TO 120 SQUARE FEET.
AND SO

[Captioner] 22:31:50
 WITH THAT,

[Captioner] 22:31:53
 WAS THAT THE MAXIMUM

[Captioner] 22:31:56
 THAT 
THE SIGNS COULD BE OR WAS THAT 
THE MINIMUM, JUST TO UNDERSTAND

[Captioner] 22:31:59
 
A LITTLE BIT.
>> UNDER THE CODE 120 SQUARE 


[Captioner] 22:32:03
FEET IS THE MAXIMUM.
THEY WERE PROPOSING A LITTLE BIT 
BIGGER

[Captioner] 22:32:06
 WITH DISCRETION FROM THE 
COMMISSION BUT WHEN THE 
COMMISSION WASN'T SUPPORTIVE

[Captioner] 22:32:09
 OF 
THAT THEY WENT DOWN TO WHAT THE 
CODE DOES ALLOW

[Captioner] 22:32:12
 WHICH WAS 120 
SQUARE FEET.
THERE IS NO HEIGHT

[Captioner] 22:32:15
 STANDARD IN 
THE CODE FOR THIS TYPE OF SIGN.
>> Councilmember Cox:  

[Captioner] 22:32:18
 OH, 
THERE ISN'T, OH, OKAY.
AND

[Captioner] 22:32:21
 IS THERE ANY REASON WHY?


[Captioner] 22:32:25
JUST --
>> PROBABLY TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT 
ISSUES LIKE AT

[Captioner] 22:32:27
 THIS SITE WHERE 
THE FREEWAY IS AT A DIFFERENT 
GRADE FROM THE

[Captioner] 22:32:31
 SITE.
I BELIEVE IT'S A 13-FOOT 
DIFFERENCE IN

[Captioner] 22:32:34
 GRADE.
SO IF WE WERE TO SAY LIMIT SIGNS

[Captioner] 22:32:37
 
TO 20 FEET IN HEIGHT, SITES LIKE 
THIS WOULD

[Captioner] 22:32:41
 HAVE VERY LITTLE

[Captioner] 22:32:43
 
SIGNAGE POSSIBLE.
THAT'S PROBABLY WHY IT WAS 


[Captioner] 22:32:46
WRITTEN THAT WAY BUT I DIDN'T 
WRITE THE UNFORTUNATELY

[Captioner] 22:32:50
.
>> Councilmember Cox:   OKAY.
I DO APPRECIATE THE

[Captioner] 22:32:53
 FLEXIBILITY, 
MEETING -- THE BOTTOM LINE IS 
THE SIGN

[Captioner] 22:32:56
 MEETS THE CITY 
ORDINANCE FOR SIGNS.
AND THERE'S BEEN

[Captioner] 22:32:59
 NO COMPLAINTS, 
NO THINGS RAISED OR SUBMITTED.

[Captioner] 22:33:02

AND OBVIOUSLY, IN ALL THE 
DIFFERENT PRESENTATIONS

[Captioner] 22:33:06
 AND 
DOCUMENTATIONS THAT RECEIVED,

[Captioner] 22:33:09
 
AND ADDITIONALLY I LIKE THE PART 
THAT IT IS SUSTAINABILITY

[Captioner] 22:33:12
 IS 
GREEN, AND YOU CAN CONTROL HOW

[Captioner] 22:33:15
 
BRIGHT AND HOW LOW AND YOU HAVE 
OPERATING

[Captioner] 22:33:18
 HOURS THAT PROBABLY WE 
NEED TO KIND OF UNDERSTAND A 
LITTLE BIT MORE

[Captioner] 22:33:21
 THERE IF YOU 
COULD JUST HIGHLIGHT WHAT WOULD 
BE THE OPERATING

[Captioner] 22:33:25
 HOURS.
THAT IF YOU HAD THE BRIGHT

[Captioner] 22:33:28
EST 
LIGHT, HOW LONG WOULD THAT BE ON

[Captioner] 22:33:31
 
AND FROM WHAT TIME PERIOD

[Captioner] 22:33:35
?

[Captioner] 22:33:45

>> OUR CURRENT BUSINESS HOURS 
ARE 8 TO 5

[Captioner] 22:33:48
 AND WE WOULD PROBABLY 
RUN AN EXTEND

[Captioner] 22:33:51
ED SECOND SHIFT 7 
TO 6.
IF

[Captioner] 22:33:54
 DIMMING WERE TO COME INTO 
PLAY THE TYPICAL IS AN HOUR

[Captioner] 22:33:57
 
AFTER CLOSE OF BUSINESS AND THEN 
REBRIGHTENING AN HOUR

[Captioner] 22:34:01
 AFTER 
START OF BUSINESS.
>> Councilmember Cox:   OKAY

[Captioner] 22:34:04
, 
AND THEN PART OF IT IS AS WE GET 
IN THE

[Captioner] 22:34:07
 SUMMER IT'S GOING TO BE A 
LOT MORE SUN LIGHT SO

[Captioner] 22:34:10
 NO MATTER 
HOW BRIGHT IT WON'T SEE THE 
DIFFERENCE

[Captioner] 22:34:14
 UNTIL 9:30 OR 10:00 
AT NIGHT AS

[Captioner] 22:34:17
 THE SEASONS CHANGE.
SO BASICALLY THE LIGHTING

[Captioner] 22:34:20
 CAN BE 
ADJUSTED AT ANY TIME RIGHT?
>> YES.

[Captioner] 22:34:23

>> Councilmember Cox:   AND SO 
THAT'S A GOOD BENEFIT AND I'M 


[Captioner] 22:34:26
SURE YOU COULD DO IT REMOTELY IF 
THERE WAS NEED

[Captioner] 22:34:29
ED TO BE.
BUT YOU WOULD HAVE IT ON FROM 
THE TIME YOUR OFFICE

[Captioner] 22:34:32
 WOULD CLOSE 
IN A BUSINESS DAY, OH UNTIL LIKE

[Captioner] 22:34:36
 
IT WOULD GO OVER THE WEEKEND 
THAT YOU WOULD MAINTAIN IT THAT

[Captioner] 22:34:40
 
SAME BRIGHTNESS.
>> THE SIGNS

[Captioner] 22:34:43
 ARE TYPICALLY 
RESPONSIVE TO A PHOTO

[Captioner] 22:34:46
 CELL, SO 
WHEN THE LIGHT LEVEL, THE 
AMBIENT LIGHT

[Captioner] 22:34:50
 LEVEL REACHES A 
CERTAIN DARKNESS THAT

[Captioner] 22:34:53
 WILL 
AUTOMATICALLY TURN ON AND THAT 
WILL

[Captioner] 22:34:56
 VARY WITH THE SEASONALS.

[Captioner] 22:35:00

THE BRIGHTNESS CAN

[Captioner] 22:35:04
 VARY WITH 
BUSINESS HOURS OR ANY TIME.
>> Councilmember Cox: 

[Captioner] 22:35:07
  GOT IT.
IS THE COMPANY

[Captioner] 22:35:10
 LOCATED IN 
FREMONT THAT YOU ARE

[Captioner] 22:35:13
 PURCHASING 
THE SIGNS FOR?
I'M CURIOUS.


[Captioner] 22:35:16
>> NO RAMSAY SIGNS DO ALL OF OUR

[Captioner] 22:35:20
 
SIGNS BASED ON THE WEST COAST, 
THEY ARE IN OREGON.

[Captioner] 22:35:23

>> Councilmember Cox:   OKAY, I 
WAS JUST CURIOUS ON THAT WITH 


[Captioner] 22:35:26
THE CONNECTION.
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED, AND

[Captioner] 22:35:29
 I 
APPRECIATE ALSO THE FREMONT 
CHAMBER SPEAKING IN SUPPORT

[Captioner] 22:35:32
 AS 
WELL, AS THEY HAVE BEEN WORKING 
WITH YOU

[Captioner] 22:35:35
 AS WELL.
I'M FULLY IN SUPPORT.
I'M NOT GOING TO LET A

[Captioner] 22:35:38
 SIGN KEEP 
YOU OUT OF DOING BUSINESS HERE 
IN FREMONT.


[Captioner] 22:35:41
I MEAN THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE.
SO THANK YOU

[Captioner] 22:35:45
.
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.
NEXT

[Captioner] 22:35:48
 IS COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN.
>> Councilmember Salwan:   THANK 
YOU, MADAM MAYOR.

[Captioner] 22:35:51

YES, WE DIDN'T GET TO SPEAK 
EITHER BUT THIS IS ONE OF

[Captioner] 22:35:54
 THOSE 
GUT CHECKS WILLIAM WITHIN TWO 
MINUTES

[Captioner] 22:35:58
,

[Captioner] 22:36:01
 WITHIN TWO MINUTES I 
KNEW THE ANSWER

[Captioner] 22:36:04
 WHEN STAFF 
EXPLAINED IT TO ME.
BRINGING

[Captioner] 22:36:07
 REVENUES THIS IS A 
PARCEL INDUSTRIAL LAND

[Captioner] 22:36:10
 NEAR A 
FREEWAY.
IF WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE A BIG 


[Captioner] 22:36:13
SIGN WHERE ARE WE GOING TO HAVE 
IT?
I THINK THIS IS THE

[Captioner] 22:36:17
 RIGHT SIGN 
AT THE RIGHT PLACE AND I'M VERY 
HAPPY TO SUPPORT IT

[Captioner] 22:36:20
 AND THERE IS 
NO COMMUNITY OPPOSITION SO I 
DON'T SEE ANY REASON

[Captioner] 22:36:23
 TO DENY 
THIS.
SO I WISH YOU WELL AND HOPE YOU 


[Captioner] 22:36:26
MAKE A LOT OF MONEY SO THAT YOU 
CAN PAY LOTS OF

[Captioner] 22:36:29
 TAXES AND HELP 
OUR LOCAL

[Captioner] 22:36:32
 ECONOMY.
AND YOU ALSO GOT ME THINKING OF 
SIGNS AND THE POWER

[Captioner] 22:36:35
 OF THE 
MARKETING SO THAT WAS A GOOD 
POINT YOU MADE THERE SO 


[Captioner] 22:36:38
SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT.
THANK YOU AGAIN I WISH YOU WELL 
HAPPY TO

[Captioner] 22:36:41
 SUPPORT THIS.
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

WAS ABLE TO SPEAK WITH YOU

[Captioner] 22:36:50
 AND 
GET A LOT OF MY QUESTIONS 
ANSWERED.


[Captioner] 22:36:53
SO I APPRECIATE IT.
I

[Captioner] 22:36:56
 ECHO MY FELLOW COUNCIL PERSONS 
AND

SIGNAGE,

[Captioner] 22:37:06

APPROVAL.

[Captioner] 22:37:09

>> Mayor Mei:   WE ACTUALLY HAVE 
OTHER

[Captioner] 22:37:12
 PEOPLE TO SPEAK.
>> Councilmember Campbell:   I 
STILL

[Captioner] 22:37:15
 NEED TO

[Captioner] 22:37:19
 MAKE THE MOTION 
AND I NEED SOMEONE TO SECOND IT

[Captioner] 22:37:22
.
>> Councilmember Kassan:   I 
DON'T NEED TO

[Captioner] 22:37:25
 SPEAK BUT I'D LIKE 
TO SECOND IT.

[Captioner] 22:37:29

>> Mayor Mei:   WE HAVE A 
MOTION, I THINK IT WAS SECONDED

[Captioner] 22:37:32
 
BY COUNCILMEMBER COX,

[Captioner] 22:37:35
 
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN IS GOING TO 
PASS BUT I'D LIKE

[Captioner] 22:37:39
 TO SPEAK.
I THINK IT'S BEEN A LONG NIGHT.

[Captioner] 22:37:42

BUT I WANTED TO SAY REAL QUICKLY 
THAT I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY

[Captioner] 22:37:45
 TO 
SPEAK WITH YOU AND I HAVE HAD A 
CHANCE TO SEE THE

[Captioner] 22:37:48
 MOCKUP.
I HAVE FOLLOWED YOUR 
CONSTRUCTION OVER THE

[Captioner] 22:37:51
 PAST T

[Captioner] 22:37:54
 FEW 
MONTHS AND YEARS ACTUALLY OVER 
THE DIFFERENT LOCATIONS

[Captioner] 22:37:58
 YOU HAVE 
BOTH ON KATO NEW WORK

[Captioner] 22:38:01
 AND HERE.
BEING THE BASE CORE OF MANY

[Captioner] 22:38:04
 OF 
OUR INDUSTRY IS IN MANUFACTURING 
AND SO THEREFORE I AM VERY

[Captioner] 22:38:07
 
SUPPORTIVE OF THAT.
I APPRECIATE YOU ALSO TAKING THE 


[Captioner] 22:38:11
TIME TO LISTEN TO MY CONCERN

[Captioner] 22:38:14
 
SPECIFICALLY PERTAINING TO THE 
HEIGHT PERTAINING TO THE LIGHT 


[Captioner] 22:38:17
POLLUTION AND I THINK THAT IN 
LIGHT OF THE FACT IT'S KIND OF 
INTERESTING THE FUN

[Captioner] 22:38:21
 NO PUN 
INTENDED THAT WE'LL BE ABLE

[Captioner] 22:38:24
 TO 
ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS I THINK I 
WOULD BE SUPPORTIVE

[Captioner] 22:38:27
 OF THAT IF 
WE ARE ABLE TO ADDRESS, I'M

[Captioner] 22:38:30
 GLAD 
WE HAVE THE HEIGHT MOCK JULY

[Captioner] 22:38:34
UP AND 
THE

[Captioner] 22:38:38
 DIMMABLE.
FOR THE SEASONS.
WE

[Captioner] 22:38:42
 HAVE THE MOTION AND SECOND 
AND I'D LIKE TO CALL THE VOTE.
AND SO I

[Captioner] 22:38:45
 JUST WANTED TO LET YOU 
KNOW CONGRATULATIONS,

[Captioner] 22:38:48
 AND I

[Captioner] 22:40:58
COUNCILMEMBER KENG.
>> Vice Mayor Keng:   THANK YOU

[Captioner] 22:41:01
, 
MADAM MAYOR.
I'D LIKE TO COMMENT THAT, YOU 


[Captioner] 22:41:05
KNOW, WITH THE FORECAST ECONOMIC 
DOWNTURN

[Captioner] 22:41:09
 POSSIBLY OR RECESSION,

[Captioner] 22:41:12
 
IT -- PEOPLE WILL BE MORE

[Captioner] 22:41:14
 
CONSERVATIVE IN INVESTING AND 
BUILDING.


[Captioner] 22:41:17
AND WITH THE INCREASE OF THE 13.

[Captioner] 22:41:21

13.65 OF IMPACT FEE, AND

[Captioner] 22:41:25
 WITH 
THE, YOU KNOW, HIGH NUMBER

[Captioner] 22:41:28
 OF 
RHNA NUMBER THAT WE NEED TO MEET

[Captioner] 22:41:31
 
TO BUILD ALL THE UNITS AND 
HOUSING UNITS THAT WE

[Captioner] 22:41:34
 NEED TO 
BUILD, I WILL BE SUPPORTIVE

[Captioner] 22:41:38
 TO 
REINSTALL THE DEFERRAL

[Captioner] 22:41:43
 OF THE 
IMPACT FEES SO THAT

[Captioner] 22:41:46
 WE CAN 
ENCOURAGE MORE PROJECTS TO 
CONTINUE

[Captioner] 22:41:49
 TO COME THROUGH US.
AND WE CAN BUILD THOSE UNITS

[Captioner] 22:41:52
 
THAT WE NEED.


[Captioner] 22:41:57
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.
NEXT IS COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN.


[Captioner] 22:42:00
>> Councilmember Kassan:   THANK 
YOU.
AS FAR AS I KNOW,

[Captioner] 22:42:04
 WE HAVE NEVER 
FALLEN SHORT

[Captioner] 22:42:07
 OF OUR RHNA NUMBERS 
WHEN IT COMES TO MARKET

[Captioner] 22:42:10
 RATE 
HOUSING IN OUR LAST CYCLE WE 
EXCEEDED

[Captioner] 22:42:14
 THE RHNA NUMBERS BY 
HUNDREDS

[Captioner] 22:42:17
 OF PERCENTAGE POINTS.
WE DID MORE THAN THREE

[Captioner] 22:42:20
 TIMES 
MORE THAN WHAT THE RHNA

[Captioner] 22:42:22
 NUMBERS 
REQUIRED.
AND I UNDERSTAND THERE HAS BEEN 


[Captioner] 22:42:27
TALK OF A POTENTIAL RECESSION 
BUT THAT IS NOT A CURRENT

[Captioner] 22:42:29
 
SITUATION.
AND IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S JUST A 


[Captioner] 22:42:32
LOT OF TALK RIGHT NOW GIVEN THE 
MOST RECENT JOBS REPORT

[Captioner] 22:42:36
.
SO I WOULD STRONGLY URGE THAT

[Captioner] 22:42:39
 WE 
NOT DO THIS RIGHT NOW.
WE CAN ALWAYS DO IT LATER

[Captioner] 22:42:42
, IF WE 
DO START TO NOTICE A SLOW DOWN.
I KNOW THE

[Captioner] 22:42:45
 LAST TIME WE DID THIS 
IT

[Captioner] 22:42:48
 WAS THIS RESPONSE TO ACTUAL 
RECESSION WHERE DEVELOPMENT

[Captioner] 22:42:52
 WAS 
SLOWING DOWN.
SO I

[Captioner] 22:42:55
 WOULD OPPOSE REINSTATING 
THE

[Captioner] 22:42:58
 DEFERRAL.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 22:43:01
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.
NEXT IS COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL

[Captioner] 22:43:04
.
>> Councilmember Campbell:   OH 
I JUST HAVE ONE QUICK QUESTION

[Captioner] 22:43:08
.
I WASN'T AROUND WHEN THIS 
ORIGINALLY CAME

[Captioner] 22:43:11
 OUT, SO MY 
QUESTION MAY BE A

[Captioner] 22:43:15
 LITTLE -- YOU 
MAY HAVE ANSWERED IT BEFORE BUT 
I

[Captioner] 22:43:19
 JUST DIDN'T HEAR IT.
PAGE 4 OF THE

[Captioner] 22:43:22
 STAFF REPORT, IT 
TALKED ABOUT THE

[Captioner] 22:43:25
 PHASED INCREASE 
PIECE.
OKAY, AND IT

[Captioner] 22:43:28
 SAYS THAT SORT OF 
DOWN BY THE

[Captioner] 22:43:31
 LAST SENTENCE THAT 
TALKED

[Captioner] 22:43:34
 ABOUT

[Captioner] 22:43:38
 THAT STAFF 
THEREFORE DOES NOT RECOMMEND

[Captioner] 22:43:41
 
THAT THE COUNCIL PURSUE THE 
PHASED PAYMENT OPTION

[Captioner] 22:43:44
 BECAUSE OF 
THE -- AND I THINK IT WAS 
BECAUSE OF THE NUMBER

[Captioner] 22:43:48
 OF 
PROJECTS.
SO HOW MANY PROJECTS ARE WE 


[Captioner] 22:43:51
TALKING ABOUT?
IS THAT SIMILAR

[Captioner] 22:43:54
 TO THE

[Captioner] 22:43:58
 TWO TO 
300 PROJECTS OR IS IT

[Captioner] 22:44:02
 LESS BASED 
ON THE AVERAGE THAT I'VE SEEN 
OVER THE LAST SEVERAL

[Captioner] 22:44:05
 YEARS THAT 
YOU HAVE IN THE STAFF REPORT

[Captioner] 22:44:09
?
>> Hans Larsen:   SO I KNOW THAT 
THE NUMBER OF

[Captioner] 22:44:13
 PROJECTS LAST YEAR 
THAT WERE SUBJECT TO IMPACT FEES 
WAS

[Captioner] 22:44:16
 ABOUT 135.

[Captioner] 22:44:20

LAST YEAR, WAS PROBABLY

[Captioner] 22:44:23
 
REPRESENTATIVE, I DON'T HAVE 
THAT DATA GOING ALL THE WAY BACK

[Captioner] 22:44:27
 
TO 2016.
BUT, YOU KNOW, IT IS

[Captioner] 22:44:30
 KIND OF IN 
THAT RANGE.
AND THE ISSUE WITH THE PHASE

[Captioner] 22:44:35
ED -- 
THE PHASE-IN OF IMPLEMENT

[Captioner] 22:44:38
ING THE 
13.65%

[Captioner] 22:44:42
 INCREASE, I MEAN IT MAKES 
SENSE, YOU KNOW, SORT OF FROM A

[Captioner] 22:44:45
 
THEORETICAL STANDPOINT BUT JUST 
FROM AN

[Captioner] 22:44:48
 ADMINISTRATIVE 
STANDPOINT IT WOULD BE VERY, 
VERY DIFFICULT FOR US TO 


[Captioner] 22:44:51
IMPLEMENT.
WE ALREADY HAVE A SYSTEM IN 
PLACE

[Captioner] 22:44:54
 THAT DEFERS FEES

[Captioner] 22:44:58
 FOR 
COMMERCIAL AND

[Captioner] 22:45:04
 AFFORDABLE 
HOUSING PROJECTS.
AND THAT SYSTEM BASICALLY

[Captioner] 22:45:09
 
REQUIRES THAT THE FEES BE PAID 
EITHER AT CERTIFICATE OF

[Captioner] 22:45:12
 
OCCUPANCY OR 18 MONTHS AFTER THE 
BUILDING PERMIT

[Captioner] 22:45:15
, WHICHEVER COMES 
FIRST

[Captioner] 22:45:18
.
IF WE INSTITUTED A DIFFERENT 
ARRANGEMENT AND A PHASED FEE

[Captioner] 22:45:22
 
WOULD ESSENTIALLY BE KIND OF 
DOUBLE THE WORK BECAUSE WE'D

[Captioner] 22:45:25
 
BE -- FIRST WE'D COLLECT THE 
MAIN PART OF THE FEES

[Captioner] 22:45:28
 AT 
BUILDING PERMIT BUT THEN WE 
WOULD HAVE TO DO THE WHOLE

[Captioner] 22:45:32
 
MACHINERY TO DO A DEFERRAL FOR 
THE

[Captioner] 22:45:35
 MARGINAL INCREASE.
AND IT WOULD BE DIFFERENT FROM

[Captioner] 22:45:38
 
ANYTHING ELSE THAT WE'RE DOING.
SO BECAUSE IT WOULD INCREASE THE

[Captioner] 22:45:42
 
WORKLOAD AND IT WOULD BE SORT OF 
A ONE-OFF

[Captioner] 22:45:45
 SPECIAL ARRANGEMENT 
JUST FOR ONE SET OF PERMITS, 
FROM

[Captioner] 22:45:48
 A STAFF PERSPECTIVE IT'S 
VERY COMPLICATED TO

[Captioner] 22:45:51
 IMPLEMENT 
AND WE THINK THAT THAT WOULDN'T 
BE A GOOD IDEA.


[Captioner] 22:45:54
SO THAT WAS THE REASON FOR THAT 
RECOMMENDATION

[Captioner] 22:45:57
.
>> Councilmember Campbell:   SO

[Captioner] 22:46:01
 
I'M STILL TRYING TO UNDERSTAND

[Captioner] 22:46:05
 
THE DEFERRAL PROCESS.

[Captioner] 22:46:08

IT WOULD BE THE 18 MONTHS

[Captioner] 22:46:12
 
CONDITIONAL ON BUILDING PERMITS 
OR CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY

[Captioner] 22:46:16
.
>> Dan Schoenholz:   SO --
>> Councilmember Campbell:   


[Captioner] 22:46:20
THAT WOULD BE THE DEFERRAL 
PROCESS

[Captioner] 22:46:22
?
>> Dan Schoenholz:   THE PROCESS 
WOULD BE THAT OR THE PROJECTS 


[Captioner] 22:46:25
THAT ARE SUBJECT TO THE IMPACT 
FEES, AT THE TIME

[Captioner] 22:46:29
 THAT THEY ARE 
READY TO GET THEIR BUILDING 
PERMIT

[Captioner] 22:46:32
, WE'RE READY TO ISSUE IT, 
BEFORE WE ISSUE IT, THEY

[Captioner] 22:46:36
 ENTER 
INTO A DEFERRAL AGREEMENT THAT'S 
RECORDED

[Captioner] 22:46:39
, AND THE -- BASICALLY

[Captioner] 22:46:42
 
THEY DON'T PAY ANY FEES WHEN 
THEY GET THEIR

[Captioner] 22:46:45
 BUILDING PERMIT 
BUT THEY HAVE TO PAY THEIR FEES 
EITHER TO

[Captioner] 22:46:49
 GET THE CERTIFICATE OF 
OCCUPANCY IF THEIR

[Captioner] 22:46:52
 PROJECT ONLY 
TAKES 12 MONTHS TO BUILD BUT IF 
THEIR PROJECT

[Captioner] 22:46:55
 TAKES TWO YEARS TO 
BUILD AT THE 18-MONTH

[Captioner] 22:46:58
 POINT WE 
CALL IN THE IMPACT FEES.
>> Councilmember Campbell:  

[Captioner] 22:47:00
 
THAT'S WHERE I WAS A BIT 
CONFUSED.


[Captioner] 22:47:03
THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei:  

[Captioner] 22:47:06
 THANK YOU.
COUNCILMEMBER COX.


[Captioner] 22:47:14
SORRY YOUR -- YOU'RE ON

[Captioner] 22:47:17
 MUTE, 
SORRY, THANK YOU.
>> Councilmember Cox:   OKAY, 


[Captioner] 22:47:20
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS 
REPORT, AND I APPRECIATE THE 
CONSIDERATION THAT WE DID

[Captioner] 22:47:23
 WHEN 
WE SPLIT AND WE WERE LOOKING AT 
THE

[Captioner] 22:47:26
 13.65 AND KIND OF DIVIDING 
IT

[Captioner] 22:47:30
 OVER TWO PAYMENTS WITH THE 
JULY

[Captioner] 22:47:34
 AND DECEMBER, I THINK IT 
WAS, THAT WE WERE LOOKING

[Captioner] 22:47:37
 AT A 
FEW MONTHS BACK.
I

[Captioner] 22:47:40
 SAW SOMETHING WITH THE 
MITIGATION

[Captioner] 22:47:43
 FEE ACT AND I WAS 
TRYING TO UNDERSTAND, THERE WAS 
SOMETHING

[Captioner] 22:47:46
 ABOUT WE HAVE SOME 
SORT OF DISCRETION.
BUT

[Captioner] 22:47:49
 THERE WAS SOME SORT OF 
FIVE-YEAR ACCOUNTING OR

[Captioner] 22:47:53
 UNUSED 
AND COULD YOU SHED SOME LIGHT ON 
THAT FARTHER AND

[Captioner] 22:47:56
 PART AND HOW IT'S THAT

[Captioner] 22:48:00
 ROLE 
INTO THE DEFERRED PAYMENT

[Captioner] 22:48:04
?

[Captioner] 22:48:07

>> Dan Schoenholz:   DO YOU WANT 
ME TO ANSWER THAT ONE

[Captioner] 22:48:10
?
YES, THE MITIGATION ACT DOES 
HAVE CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS FOR 


[Captioner] 22:48:14
THE CITY TO FULFILL.
EACH YEAR WE DO AN ANNUAL REPORT

[Captioner] 22:48:17
 
AND THEN EVERY FIVE YEARS WE DO 
SORT OF A COMPREHENSIVE

[Captioner] 22:48:20
 RELOOK 
AT OUR IMPACT FEES.
SO

[Captioner] 22:48:23
 THE COMPREHENSIVE FIVE-YEAR 
UPDATE

[Captioner] 22:48:27
 WAS -- IT WAS LAST YEAR, 
I BELIEVE.

[Captioner] 22:48:30

YEAH.
AND SO THERE'S NO

[Captioner] 22:48:33
 PLAN TO DO 
THAT UNTIL THE NEXT, YOU KNOW,

[Captioner] 22:48:36
 
THE NEXT DUE DATE FOUR YEARS 
DOWN THE ROAD.


[Captioner] 22:48:39
BUT EACH YEAR WE

[Captioner] 22:48:44
 REVIEW THE 
PROGRAM, THE IMPACT FEES THAT 
WE'VE COLLECTED.

[Captioner] 22:48:48

WHAT WE'VE TRADITIONALLY DONE

[Captioner] 22:48:51
 AT 
THAT POINT IS ALSO ASK THE 
COUNCIL

[Captioner] 22:48:55
 THE IMPROVE AN INCREASE 
RELATED

[Captioner] 22:48:58
 TO INFLATION.
THIS YEAR WE DID IT A

[Captioner] 22:49:01
 LITTLE 
EARLY BECAUSE IT WAS SO

[Captioner] 22:49:04
 LARGE WE 
WANTED TO GIVE THE, YOU KNOW,

[Captioner] 22:49:08
 
THE REGULATING COMMUNITY SORT OF 
TIME

[Captioner] 22:49:11
 TO ADJUST TO THE FACT THAT 
THE FEES WERE GOING TO GO UP

[Captioner] 22:49:14
.
YOU KNOW, RELATIVELY 
SIGNIFICANTLY.


[Captioner] 22:49:19
>> Councilmember Cox:   OKAY.
AND, YOU KNOW, WE KNOW THAT THE 
UN

[Captioner] 22:49:22
EMPLOYMENT IS AT 3.4% WHICH IS 
STILL

[Captioner] 22:49:25
 VERY TRADITIONALLY LOW.

[Captioner] 22:49:29

I WAS TRYING TO UNDERSTAND IF WE 
HAD DIVIDED OUT

[Captioner] 22:49:31
, DID YOU RUN ANY 
SCENARIOS OF NUMBER

[Captioner] 22:49:35
 NUMBERS THAT SAY 
HOW, WHAT WE HAD ORIGINAL

[Captioner] 22:49:38
LY 
PROPOSED, I'M HEARING THAT THERE 
WAS AN

[Captioner] 22:49:41
 INCREASE IN WORKLOAD, 
THERE WAS I GUESS TWICE THE

[Captioner] 22:49:44
 
AMOUNT OF WORK THAT YOU ARE 
TRYING TO DO ONE OFF TO TRY

[Captioner] 22:49:47
 THE 
KIND OF KEEP EACH DIFFERENT 
PROJECT AND KIND OF WHERE

[Captioner] 22:49:50
 IT 
FALLS INTO THE CATEGORY OF JULY 
OR DECEMBER,

[Captioner] 22:49:54
 RIGHT?
AND SO I WAS JUST CURIOUS THAT 
THERE WAS

[Captioner] 22:49:57
 ANY OTHER SCENARIOS OF

[Captioner] 22:50:01
 
WHAT WAS THE IMPACT THAT WOULD 
BE

[Captioner] 22:50:04
 IN COLLECTING THE IMPACT FEES

[Captioner] 22:50:07
 
OF HOW DRASTIC IT WOULD BE JUST 
SO

[Captioner] 22:50:10
 WE HAVE KIND OF SOME SORT OF 
COMPARISON

[Captioner] 22:50:14
.
>> Dan Schoenholz:   AS WE NOTED

[Captioner] 22:50:18
 
IN THE REPORT, IT IS KIND OF 
DIFFICULT TO GET

[Captioner] 22:50:22
 ANY 
QUANTITATIVE IMPACTS OF THE 
DEFERRAL.


[Captioner] 22:50:25
THE SAME FOR A PHASEAPPROACH

[Captioner] 22:50:28
.
WE DIDN'T DO ANY ESTIMATES FOR 
EITHER OPTION REALLY

[Captioner] 22:50:31
.
WHAT WE DID SAY IN THE REPORT 
ABOUT THE PHASED

[Captioner] 22:50:34
 PROPER, IS THAT 
IT WOULD

[Captioner] 22:50:38
 PROBABLY SORT OF A 
MIDDLE GROUND.
IT WOULD

[Captioner] 22:50:41
 PROVIDE LESS BENEFIT TO 
THE DEVELOPERS, AND IT

[Captioner] 22:50:44
 WOULD 
REQUIRE A LITTLE LESS DEFERRAL 
OF

[Captioner] 22:50:48
 FEES.
WE WOULDN'T COLLECT FEES AT 
BUILDING PERMIT BUT

[Captioner] 22:50:51
 WE WOULDN'T 
HAVE TO WAIT 18 MONTHS TO 
RECEIVE THEM.


[Captioner] 22:50:54
SO IT WOULD LIKELY HAVE LESS 
IMPACT

[Captioner] 22:50:57
 ON INFRASTRUCTURE, 
TIMING, AND COST

[Captioner] 22:51:01
.
SO IT WAS REALLY A QUALITATIVE

[Captioner] 22:51:04
 
ANALYSIS THAT WAS IN THE REPORT, 
AND THAT'S ABOUT

[Captioner] 22:51:08
 -- AGAIN IT'S 
VERY DIFFICULT TO GET ANYTHING

[Captioner] 22:51:11
 
BEYOND THAT BECAUSE

[Captioner] 22:51:14
 CONSTRUCTION 
DECISIONS AND THEN YOU KNOW KIND 
OF THE CONSTRUCTION ECONOMY

[Captioner] 22:51:17
 IS 
SO MULTIFACETED, THERE IS

[Captioner] 22:51:21
 SO 
MANY VARIABLES

[Captioner] 22:51:24
 THAT IT IS VERY 
DIFFICULT TO

[Captioner] 22:51:27
 ISOLATE WHAT 
VARIABLE IMPACTS WHAT HAPPENED

[Captioner] 22:51:30
.
>> Councilmember Cox:   WITH THE 
LABOR THE MATERIAL ALL THE OTHER 


[Captioner] 22:51:33
THINGS THAT HAVE THAT CHALLENGE, 
I WAS TRYING TO UNDERSTAND ON

[Captioner] 22:51:36
 
PAGE 3 RIGHT ABOVE YOUR

[Captioner] 22:51:40
 ANALYSIS 
SUBTITLE, THAT LITTLE PARAGRAPH 
THAT TALKED ABOUT

[Captioner] 22:51:43
 THE REVENUES.
AND I THINK THAT'S KIND OF LIKE

[Captioner] 22:51:46

LIKE -- SUMS UP WHAT YOU ARE 
KIND OF REFERRING TO

[Captioner] 22:51:50
 IN THAT 
CASE WITH THE REVENUE,

[Captioner] 22:51:54
 SO 
DIMINISHED AS DEFERRED PAYMENTS 
FOR MARKET

[Captioner] 22:51:57
 RATE RESIDENTIAL 
PROJECTS ENDED AND A

[Captioner] 22:52:00
 NUMBER OF 
CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS SUBJECT TO 
IMPACT FEES

[Captioner] 22:52:04
 DECLINED, THAT WAS A 
MOUTHFUL, I WAS TRYING TO BREAK 
IT

[Captioner] 22:52:07
 DOWN AND UNDERSTAND THE 
DIFFERENT PARTS.
BUT YOU'RE SAYING

[Captioner] 22:52:10
 THAT YOU HAVE 
135 PROJECTS,

[Captioner] 22:52:13
 THAT WAS LAST 
YEAR, THAT ARE LOOK

[Captioner] 22:52:16
ING AT THE 
IMPACT FEES WHICH

[Captioner] 22:52:19
 WOULD THEN BE 
CARRIED OVER WITH WHAT WE WERE 
LOOK

[Captioner] 22:52:23
ING AT IN THE TIME PERIOD 
GOING FORWARD WHICH COULD ADD A

[Captioner] 22:52:26
 
LOT MORE ACCOUNTING AND MORE 
WORK

[Captioner] 22:52:29
.
LESS PRODUCTIVITY THAN IT'S 
WORTH, RIGHT?

[Captioner] 22:52:32

SO DEFERRAL, BENEFIT,

[Captioner] 22:52:35
 IS NOT AS 
HELPFUL AS I GUESS WE WERE 
TRYING

[Captioner] 22:52:39
 TO THINK TO KIND OF

[Captioner] 22:52:42
 ALLOW 
PROJECTS TO KEEP GOING AND

[Captioner] 22:52:45
 
MOVING FORWARD.
BUT -- AND

[Captioner] 22:52:49
 BEING CONSIDERATE

[Captioner] 22:52:53
 OF 
THE CHANGE OF TIMES.
WE WERE DOING WELL, WE

[Captioner] 22:52:56
 WERE ONE 
OF THE COUNTIES OR THE CITIES I 
SHOULD

[Captioner] 22:52:59
 SAY THAT DID MEET THE 
RHNA NUMBERS THAT WAS ALSO

[Captioner] 22:53:02
 NOTED 
IN SACRAMENTO THAT I WAS THERE 
ATTENDING

[Captioner] 22:53:06
 THE CONFERENCE.
SO BASICALLY YOU'RE

[Captioner] 22:53:09
 SAYING IT'S 
REALLY -- SOUNDS LIKE A GOOD 
IDEA

[Captioner] 22:53:13
 BUT A LOT MORE

[Captioner] 22:53:17
 ACCOUNTING 
AND THINGS THAT WE'RE GOING TO 
HAVE TO REPORT OUT THAT

[Captioner] 22:53:21
 WOULD 
NOT MAKE IT THE BENEFITS OF

[Captioner] 22:53:24
 
DEFERRAL, IT'S BEING OUTWEIGHED 
BY

[Captioner] 22:53:27
 MORE WORK PAVEMENT.
>> Dan Schoenholz:   EXACT

[Captioner] 22:53:30
LY.
>> Councilmember Cox:   THAT'S 
FAIR, OKAY I APPRECIATE

[Captioner] 22:53:33
 THAT, 
AND HAVING THIS DISCUSSION.
THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH.


[Captioner] 22:53:37
>> Mayor Mei:   COUNCILMEMBER 
SHAO.
>> Councilmember Shao:   THANK 


[Captioner] 22:53:40
YOU, MADAM MAYOR.

[Captioner] 22:53:44

YOU KNOW ME I ALWAYS LOOK FOR 
DATA.


[Captioner] 22:53:47
AND THEN WHEN I WAS LOOKING AT 
PAGE 4, FOR THE

[Captioner] 22:53:51
 FISCAL ANALYSIS, 
I WAS JUST FEELING SO

[Captioner] 22:53:54
 
UNCOMFORTABLE SEEING ANY DATA 
THERE.


[Captioner] 22:53:57
IT'S ALL DESCRIPTION

[Captioner] 22:54:00
, BUT WHEN I 
GO TO PAGE

[Captioner] 22:54:04
 3, WHERE I CAN 
FINALLY SEE SOME NUMBERS,

[Captioner] 22:54:07
 I 
NOTICE SOME PATTERNS.
AND

[Captioner] 22:54:11
 SO AGREE THAT AT LEAST THAT 
PART WOULD

[Captioner] 22:54:14
 GIVE ME SOME BASIS 
FOR MY DECISION.

[Captioner] 22:54:17

MY QUESTION IS THAT, OVER HERE

[Captioner] 22:54:20
, 
THE NUMBER OF PROJECTS ARE 
LISTED OVER THE

[Captioner] 22:54:23
 YEARS.
BUT AS YOU KNOW, PROJECTS CAN BE 
BIG OR

[Captioner] 22:54:27
 SMALL.
AND WE CHARGE IMPACT

[Captioner] 22:54:30
 FEE NOT BY 
PROJECT BUT BY

[Captioner] 22:54:33
 SQUARE FEET.
THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING, RIGHT?

[Captioner] 22:54:36

SO IN THAT CASE

[Captioner] 22:54:39
, IT WILL BE MORE 
HELPFUL IF I

[Captioner] 22:54:43
 CAN JUST NORMALIZE

[Captioner] 22:54:46
 
THE COLLECTION OF IMPACT FEES

[Captioner] 22:54:51
 BY 
THE SQUARE FOOTAGE FOR EACH YEAR 
RATHER THAN THE NUMBER

[Captioner] 22:54:54
 OF 
PROJECTS.
BUT OKAY.

[Captioner] 22:54:58

MAYBE I CAN ALSO ARGUE TO 
MYSELF,

[Captioner] 22:55:01
 THAT, YOU KNOW, EVEN 
THOUGH PROJECTS CAN BE BIG OR

[Captioner] 22:55:04
 
SMALL BUT OVER SO MANY YEARS, 
PROBABLY

[Captioner] 22:55:07
, THAT WOULD REFLECT A

[Captioner] 22:55:10
 
TYPICAL COMBINATION OF PROJECTS 
OF DIFFERENT SIZES.


[Captioner] 22:55:13
SO USING THE NUMBER OF PROJECTS 
COULD

[Captioner] 22:55:16
 MAYBE MEAN SOMETHING.
BUT WHAT I'M LOOK

[Captioner] 22:55:20
ING AT 
DEFINITELY IS A PATTERN.
AND I DO NOTICE THE

[Captioner] 22:55:24
 PATTERN.
SO IN THAT CASE

[Captioner] 22:55:27
, I DO SEE THE

[Captioner] 22:55:32
 -- 
THE TERMINATION OF THE DEFERRAL

[Captioner] 22:55:36
 
WOULD CAUSE

[Captioner] 22:55:40
 THE PROJECTS TO BE 
FEWER AND FEWER

[Captioner] 22:55:44
.

[Captioner] 22:55:50

SO I WAS LEANING TO APPROVING 
THE INSTALLATION, THE

[Captioner] 22:55:52
 
REINSTATEMENT OF THIS DEFERRAL 
PROGRAM.


[Captioner] 22:55:55
BUT ONE LAST QUESTION.
THE

[Captioner] 22:55:59
 COUNCIL APPROVED THE 
INCREASE OF THE

[Captioner] 22:56:02
 IMPACT FEES 
REASON

[Captioner] 22:56:07
ABLY YOU KNOW OUT OF

[Captioner] 22:56:10
 SOLID 
REASON WHICH IS THE INCREASE OF 
CONSTRUCTION COST

[Captioner] 22:56:13
.
SO IF WE REIN

[Captioner] 22:56:17
STATE THE DEEFERLT

[Captioner] 22:56:20
, 
HOW ARE WE GOING TO ADDRESS THE 
COST OF CONSTRUCTION

[Captioner] 22:56:25
 IN THE 
FUTURE AND WHAT IS THE

[Captioner] 22:56:28
 FUNDING 
SOURCE FOR THAT TYPE OF 
INCREASE?

[Captioner] 22:56:32

THAT'S MY QUESTION.


[Captioner] 22:56:43
>> Hans Larsen:   SO TO RESTATE, 
SORT OF

[Captioner] 22:56:47
 THE UNDERSTANDING, THE 
ISSUE IS WHEN WE COLLECT 
DEVELOPMENT

[Captioner] 22:56:50
 FEES, YOU KNOW, IT 
GOES TO PAY FOR PARK

[Captioner] 22:56:52
 
IMPROVEMENTS, TRANSPORTATION, 
BUILDING FACILITIES.


[Captioner] 22:56:55
SO THE EARLIER WE GET IT, THE 
BENEFITS ACCRUE TO

[Captioner] 22:56:59
 OUR CAPITAL 
PROGRAM AND WE CAN DO SOMETHING 
WITH THAT

[Captioner] 22:57:02
.


[Captioner] 22:57:06
IF WE DEFER IT, THE MONEY COMES 
LATER.
AND COST

[Captioner] 22:57:09
S CAN INCREASE.
AND SO

[Captioner] 22:57:13
 THAT'S RELATED SORT OF 
THE BALANCE HERE AND I THINK WHY

[Captioner] 22:57:15
 
WE'RE RECOMMENDING THIS IS 
REALLY A POLICY CHOICE NOR THE 


[Captioner] 22:57:22
 FOR THE 
COUNCIL TO TAKE.
AND WE'VE NEVER HAD A FEE

[Captioner] 22:57:25
 
INCREASE AS HIGH AS 13.65.
SO IT'S VERY

[Captioner] 22:57:29
 UNUSUAL 
CIRCUMSTANCE AND IT'S KIND OF A 
SHOCK TO THE SYSTEM FOR BUILDERS

[Captioner] 22:57:32
 
AND DEVELOPERS TO ABSORB THAT.
AND SO, YOU KNOW,

[Captioner] 22:57:35
 WHEN COUNCIL 
DISCUSSED THIS IN DECEMBER, IT 
WAS

[Captioner] 22:57:38
, YOU KNOW, ARE WE NOT GOING 
TO GET ANY DEVELOPMENT?
BECAUSE THE

[Captioner] 22:57:42
 COSTS ARE SO HIGH.
AND THEN WE DON'T GET ANY

[Captioner] 22:57:45
 FEE 
MONEY TO DO PROJECTS.
AND SO, YOU KNOW,

[Captioner] 22:57:48
 SHOULD WE 
DEFER IT?

[Captioner] 22:57:51

AND IT'S HARD TO QUANTIFY

[Captioner] 22:57:54
 WHAT'S 
GOING TO HAPPEN AND THE 
DIFFERENT MARKET FORCES.


[Captioner] 22:57:57
AND SO I THINK IT REALLY SORT OF 
COMES TO YOU ALL

[Captioner] 22:58:00
 SORT OF WHAT DO 
YOU FEEL KIND OF IN YOUR GUT IN 
TERMS OF WHICH

[Captioner] 22:58:04
 WAY WE SHOULD GO 
ON THIS.
I THINK, YOU KNOW, THE

[Captioner] 22:58:07
 MIDDLE 
GROUND IS TO DISCUSS WAS TO 
PHASE MAYBE PHASE THE

[Captioner] 22:58:10
 FEE.
BUT THAT INTRODUCES A LOT

[Captioner] 22:58:13
 MORE 
ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN.
AND SO WE'RE NOT RECOMMENDING 


[Captioner] 22:58:16
THAT.
SO I THINK IT'S

[Captioner] 22:58:20
, YOU KNOW, 
CONTINUE AS WE HAVE BEEN, AND 
DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY IS

[Captioner] 22:58:23
 FACING 
IN JULY, A BIG INCREASE,

[Captioner] 22:58:27
 OR, YOU 
KNOW, WE DEFER IT FOR MARKET 
RATE HOUSING,

[Captioner] 22:58:30
 AS WE DO FOR 
AFFORDABLE HOUSING, COMMERCIAL

[Captioner] 22:58:33
 
DEVELOPMENT, THERE'S SOME BEAUTY

[Captioner] 22:58:36
 
TO, WE'VE GOT A CONSISTENT 
APPROACH FOR ALL DEVELOPMENT

[Captioner] 22:58:39
 
TYPES.
AND THEN THERE'S SOME

[Captioner] 22:58:41
 
ADMINISTRATIVE SIMPLICITY TO 
THAT AS WELL.


[Captioner] 22:58:44
SO THERE'S A LOT OF SORT OF PUSH 
AND

[Captioner] 22:58:47
 PULLS HERE.
HOPE THAT SORT OF CAPTURES

[Captioner] 22:58:51
 THE 
BALANCING.
IT'S

[Captioner] 22:58:54
 AS DAN SAID IT'S HARD TO 
QUANTIFY

[Captioner] 22:58:57
 WHAT'S GOING TO

[Captioner] 22:59:01
 HAPPEN 
AND THE NUMBERS ON IT.
I THINK IT'S REALLY JUST A 


[Captioner] 22:59:04
POLITICAL DECISION OF WHICH WAY 
WE WANT TO GO.

[Captioner] 22:59:05

>> Councilmember Shao:   THANK 
YOU.


[Captioner] 22:59:08
NOT TO ARGUE WITH YOU OR TO

[Captioner] 22:59:11
 
DEFEND OUR VERSION OR DECISION 
TO HAVE THIS 13

[Captioner] 22:59:15
.75 INCREASE 
AFTER AURAL, WE DID

[Captioner] 22:59:19
 EXPERIENCE 
UNPRECEDENTED

[Captioner] 22:59:23
 INFLATION, WHICH 
CERTAINLY, THE

[Captioner] 22:59:27
 NUMBER 13.5, 
DIDN'T FALL FROM THE SKY

[Captioner] 22:59:30
.
IT WAS BASED ON THE

[Captioner] 22:59:33
 CALCULATION 
USING FACTORS LIKE CPI AND ALL

[Captioner] 22:59:36
 
THE OTHER FACTORS.
SO I HAVE TO ADDRESS THAT

[Captioner] 22:59:40
.
>> Hans Larsen:   AND YOU KNOW 
WE HAVE DIRECT EXPERIENCE.


[Captioner] 22:59:43
I MEAN OUR RECENT PROJECT BIDS 
HAVE COME THIS HIGHER

[Captioner] 22:59:47
 THAN 
ESTIMATE AND WE HAD SOME ITEMS

[Captioner] 22:59:50
 
TON COUNCIL AGENDA EARLIER 
TONIGHT THAT REFLECTED THAT

[Captioner] 22:59:53
.
WE'VE HAD TO --
>> Councilmember Shao:   YES, I 


[Captioner] 22:59:56
WANT TO SAY THAT DECISION WAS 
NOT A POLITICAL DECISION

[Captioner] 22:59:58
.
>> Hans Larsen:   YES.
>> Councilmember Shao:   OKAY, 


[Captioner] 23:00:01
THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU, I 
WANT TO SHARE MY COMMENTS NOW.

[Captioner] 23:00:05

LAST NIGHT WE HAD A MEETING 
JOINTLY WITH THE

[Captioner] 23:00:08
 SCHOOL DISTRICT 
AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE 
TALKED ABOUT WAS HOW THE

[Captioner] 23:00:11
 
ENROLLMENT IS DECLINING.
AND WHILE WE HAVE ALSO

[Captioner] 23:00:14
 JUST IN 
THE PROCESS UPDATED

[Captioner] 23:00:17
 OUR HOUSING 
ELEMENT PLAN WHICH IS I HAVE 
CRITICAL FOR US TO BE

[Captioner] 23:00:20
 ABLE TO 
LOOK AT WHAT OUR OBJECTIVES IN 
TERMS

[Captioner] 23:00:23
 OF MEETING OUR RHNA 
NUMBERS WE RECOGNIZE ONE

[Captioner] 23:00:27
 OF THE 
THINGS FROM FEEDBACK NUMBERS 
FROM DEVELOPERS

[Captioner] 23:00:30
 AND THE PUBLIC 
IS PRICE INCREASE WHICH FULLY IN

[Captioner] 23:00:33
 
OUR ANALYSIS LOOKING AT THE 
RATES ADOPTED,

[Captioner] 23:00:36
 JUSTIFY THE 
13.65% I THINK IN TERMS OF OUR

[Captioner] 23:00:40
 
ADOPTION IN DECEMBER.
HOWEVER, FROM THE

[Captioner] 23:00:43
 PERSPECTIVE OF 
LOOKING AT WHETHER WE

[Captioner] 23:00:46
 WANT TO 
DEFER THAT I WOULD SUPPORT THE 
DEFERRAL BECAUSE ONE

[Captioner] 23:00:49
 OF THE 
BIGGEST FACTORS

[Captioner] 23:00:52
 ON CONSTRUCTION 
BESIDES THE LABOR COST IS ALSO

[Captioner] 23:00:56
 
THE MATERIAL COST LABOR IS THE 
CASH FLOW FOR THE DEVELOPERS

[Captioner] 23:01:00
 AND 
WE'VE BEEN HEARING FROM SO MANY 
OF THEM HOW

[Captioner] 23:01:03
 THAT HAS BEEN A 
CHALLENGE.
SO IT IS A FINE ACT AND TO

[Captioner] 23:01:06
 SPEAK 
TO A LOT OF MY COUNCILMEMBERS 
QUESTIONS BETWEEN SUPPORT

[Captioner] 23:01:09
ING THE 
ABILITY FOR PEOPLE TO BUILD 
HOUSING COLLECTING THE

[Captioner] 23:01:12
 FEES THAT 
WE NEED, IF WE MAKE IT SO 
ONEROUS

[Captioner] 23:01:15
 AND ONE OF THE 
CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE SEEN 
FROM SOME

[Captioner] 23:01:18
 OTHER PROJECTS THAT 
WEREN'T MENTIONED TONIGHT BUT

[Captioner] 23:01:22
 
WE'VE LOOKED AT RECENTLY SOME 
PROJECTS

[Captioner] 23:01:25
 WERE APPROVED BY THE 
PLANNING COMMISSION.
ALL WE CAN DO IS

[Captioner] 23:01:28
 ENTITLE 
PROJECTS BUT IF THEY CAN'T GET 
THE FINANCING NOTHING MOVES

[Captioner] 23:01:32
 
FORWARD WHENCE THE TIME AND 
DELAY WE ARE TALKING ABOUT

[Captioner] 23:01:36
.
I SUPPORT THE ADOPTION OF THE 
INCREASE BUT I DO ALSO SUPPORT

[Captioner] 23:01:39
 
THE RESIDENTIAL FEE DEFERRAL.
I ALSO DON'T AGREE

[Captioner] 23:01:42
 WITH THE 
PHASE-IN BECAUSE OF THE 
ADMINISTRATIVE COST BECAUSE IT 


[Captioner] 23:01:45
DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.
I THINK THAT KEEPING IT SPLIS 
TICK FOR

[Captioner] 23:01:49
 THE ADMINISTRATION AND 
MANAGEMENT

[Captioner] 23:01:52
 OF THE PROCESS IS 
IMPORTANT FOR STAFF AND FOR US 
TO BE ABLE

[Captioner] 23:01:55
 TO CONDUCT THIS IN AN 
EFFICIENT MANNER.
IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE

[Captioner] 23:01:58
 CAN LOOK 
AT AGAIN.
WE WILL LOOK AT THE

[Captioner] 23:02:02
 COST AGAIN.
DAN I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT TO 
COMMENT ON THE

[Captioner] 23:02:05
 NEXT CYCLE WHERE 
WE WILL BE DOING THIS BUT IT IS

[Captioner] 23:02:09
 
A TYPICAL THING WE

[Captioner] 23:02:12
 CAN REVIEW 
OVER TWO YEAR PROCESS I THINK,

[Captioner] 23:02:15
 
BUT WE DO REVIEW THAT OVER TIME.
AND WE'LL BE

[Captioner] 23:02:18
 LOOKING AT WHAT IS 
THE IMPACT ON THE ECONOMY AND

[Captioner] 23:02:22
 
THE DIFFERENT CONSTRUCTION 
PROJECTS IF PEOPLE ARE DELAYING.

[Captioner] 23:02:25

WE WOULD LIKE TO IF PEOPLE HAVE 
LOOKED AT IN THE PAST

[Captioner] 23:02:28
 WHEN IT 
COMES TO MARKET RATE AND PEOPLE 
DON'T ALWAYS CONSIDER,

[Captioner] 23:02:31
 IS THAT 
MARKET RATE HOUSING WE TALKED 
ABOUT

[Captioner] 23:02:34
 THAT LAST NIGHT AND THE 
FEES WE

[Captioner] 23:02:37
 HAVE COLLECTED, FOR THE 
DEDICATED AFFORDABLE HOUSING 
PROJECTS

[Captioner] 23:02:41
 THAT WE WERE ABLE TO 
COMPLETE IN THAT LAST CYCLE FOR

[Captioner] 23:02:45
 
THE RHNA NUMBERS SO THAT'S WHY 
WE WERE ABLE TO

[Captioner] 23:02:48
 MEET THE 
HISTORICAL NUMBERS.
SO I AM SUPPORTIVE

[Captioner] 23:02:51
 OF THIS.
DO I HAVE ANY MOTION FROM THE 
COUNCIL

[Captioner] 23:02:55
?
>> Councilmember Campbell:   WAS 
THIS A MOTION OR JUST A

[Captioner] 23:02:59
 
DIRECTION?
>> Mayor Mei:   NO, WE DO NEED 


[Captioner] 23:03:02
TO TAKE A MOTION ON THIS.
>> Councilmember Campbell:   SO 
GIVE THE DIRECTION

[Captioner] 23:03:05
?
THE ORDINANCE, BRING THE 
ORDINANCE BACK.

[Captioner] 23:03:08

>> Mayor Mei:   SORRY, FROM MY 
PERSPECTIVE I'M NOT

[Captioner] 23:03:11
 CHANGING THE 
ORIGINAL.
IS THERE ANY,

[Captioner] 23:03:15
 COUNCILMEMBER KENG 
DO YOU HAVE A COMMENT

[Captioner] 23:03:18
?
>> THROUGH THE MAYOR, AS LONG AS 
IT IS

[Captioner] 23:03:21
 A REFLECTION OF THE --
>> Mayor Mei:   THAT'S WHY I WAS 
GOING

[Captioner] 23:03:24
 TO CALL THE VOTE.
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado:   YOU

[Captioner] 23:03:28
 
CAN GAIN CONSENSUS OR CAN YOU DO 
IT BY MOTION AND SECOND

[Captioner] 23:03:31
, SOMEONE 
CAN MOVE IT BY MOTION IS

[Captioner] 23:03:35
 
ACCEPTABLE AS WELL.

[Captioner] 23:03:38

>> Councilmember Shao:   SO 
MOVED.


[Captioner] 23:03:41
>> Mayor Mei:   COUNCILMEMBER 
KENG

[Captioner] 23:03:45
 AND SHAO WERE FIRST AND 
SECOND

[Captioner] 23:03:50
.
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado:   OFTEN 
THE DEFERRAL?

[Captioner] 23:03:52

>> Councilmember Shao:   THAT'S 
CORRECT.


[Captioner] 23:03:55
>> Mayor Mei:   MOTION BY KENG 
AND SECONDED BY

[Captioner] 23:03:57
 SHAO.

>> Councilmember Campbell:   


[Captioner] 23:03:59
THERE IS A QUESTION ON THE 
FLOOR.
>> Mayor Mei:   WHAT IS THE 


[Captioner] 23:04:02
QUESTION?
>> Councilmember Cox:   ARE WE 
AGREEING TO DO A DEFERRAL AND

[Captioner] 23:04:06
 
DIVIDE 13.65 OVER THE TWO 
PAYMENTS OR ARE WE

[Captioner] 23:04:09
 NOW -- WHAT 
IS THE DEFERRAL THAT WE'RE 
DOING, THE WHOLE AMOUNT FOR

[Captioner] 23:04:12
 A 
YEAR?
OR I'M A LITTLE, I'M TRYING TO 


[Captioner] 23:04:15
UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS THE MOTION 
MADE.
>> Mayor Mei:   SO THE MOTION IS 


[Captioner] 23:04:18
TO DEFER IT BASED OFF OF KEEPING 
IN LINE INSTEAD OF HAVING

[Captioner] 23:04:22
 IT AT 
THE BUILDING PERMIT TIME AT THE 
TIME OF CERTIFICATE

[Captioner] 23:04:25
 OF OCCUPANCY 
OR 18 MONTHS.
IT'S NOT CHANGING THE

[Captioner] 23:04:28
 RATE.
THE RATE WILL BE 13.65.
IT WILL NOT BE

[Captioner] 23:04:31
 SPLIT OR PHASED 
IN BUT IT'S ONLY TO

[Captioner] 23:04:34
, WE'LL HAVE 
TO CLARIFY WITH OUR

[Captioner] 23:04:37
 
COUNCILMEMBER KENG JUST TO MAKE 
SURE SHE AGREES WITH ME

[Captioner] 23:04:41
 BUT THAT 
IS MY UNDERSTANDING.
WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLARIFY

[Captioner] 23:04:44
?
>> Vice Mayor Keng:   SO THE 
MOTION IS TO MAKE THE DEFERRAL 


[Captioner] 23:04:48
TO REINSTALL IT BACK TO WHEN WE 
HAD THE DEFERRAL BEFORE.
SO

[Captioner] 23:04:51
 THE WHOLE DEFERRAL FEE WOULD 
BE AS

[Captioner] 23:04:54
 THE MAYOR STATED AT THE 
CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY OR

[Captioner] 23:04:57
 18 
MONTHS AFTER THE ISSUANCE OF

[Captioner] 23:04:59
 
PERMIT.
>> Mayor Mei:   AT THE HIGHER 


[Captioner] 23:05:03
RATE.
>> Vice Mayor Keng:   THE WHOLE 
AMOUNT NOT PHASING

[Captioner] 23:05:07
.
>> Dan Schoenholz:  

[Captioner] 23:05:11
 IF I CAN 
CLARIFY, IN ORDER TO DO THIS WE 
HAVE TO CLARIFY

[Captioner] 23:05:14
, IT WILL HAVE TO 
COME BACK TO COUNCIL ONE MORE 
TIME.

[Captioner] 23:05:17

SO I THINK THE MOTION SHOULD 
DIRECT US TO DO

[Captioner] 23:05:20
 THAT.
>> Mayor Mei:   TO GO BACK TO 
THE PLANNING COMMISSION.


[Captioner] 23:05:23
YES.


[Captioner] 23:05:26
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado:   THE 
MOTION COULD BE TO DIRECT STAFF 
TO PREPARE LEGISLATION

[Captioner] 23:05:30
 TO 
REFLECT THE COUNCIL'S DESIRE TO 
IMPLEMENT A FEE DEFERRAL

[Captioner] 23:05:33
.
THAT WOULD SUFFICE AS STAFF 
MENTIONED WE OHAVE TO GO

[Captioner] 23:05:36
 THROUGH 
THE GENERAL LEGISLATIVE PROCESS 


[Captioner] 23:05:39
HERE, IT WOULD REQUIRE PLANNING 
COMMISSION REVIEW BEFORE IT 
COMES BACK

[Captioner] 23:05:42
 TO THE CITY COUNCIL 
OR THE ORDINANCE REVIEW IN THE 
FORM OF

[Captioner] 23:05:45
 A FIRST INTRODUCTION AND 
THEN ADOPTION.


[Captioner] 23:05:50
>> Vice Mayor Keng:   LET'S DO 
THAT

[Captioner] 23:05:52
.
>> Councilmember Shao:   I 
SECOND.


[Captioner] 23:05:55
>> Mayor Mei:   MOTION AND 
SECONDED.


[Captioner] 23:05:59
CAN WE PLEASE HAVE A VOTE?

[Captioner] 23:06:04



[Captioner] 23:06:07
THE MOTION IS MOVED TOWARD

COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN VOTING NAY.

KASSAN DO YOU HAVE A QUESTION?
