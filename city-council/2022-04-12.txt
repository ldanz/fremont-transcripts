19:03:46 >> City Mgr. Shackelford: THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR.

19:03:50 GOOD EVENING AND GOOD EVENING TO ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL AND STAFF 
19:03:50 HERE TODAY.

19:03:59 I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE MY COLLEAGUES, RAFAEL ALVARADO, CITY ATTORNEY, AND 
19:04:00 SUSAN GAUTHIER, CITY CLERK.

19:04:06 WE ALSO HAVE A NUMBER OF OTHER STAFF MEMBERS IN THE MEETING TONIGHT 
19:04:10 AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS OR PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.

19:04:15 BEFORE I CONTINUE WITH MY ANNOUNCEMENTS, I'D LIKE TO TURN IT 
19:04:21 OVER TO CITY ATTORNEY ALVARADO FOR A QUICK ANNOUNCEMENT REGARDING CLOSED 
19:04:22 SESSION.

19:04:23 >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

19:04:24 AND GOOD EVENING, MAYOR AND COUNCIL.

19:04:27 THIS IS THIS EVENING'S REPORT OUT OF CLOSED SESSION.

19:04:32 IN CLOSED SESSION, THE COUNCIL DISCUSSED CONFERENCE WITH LEGAL 
19:04:39 COUNSEL ADDRESSING LITIGATION REGARDING TWO CASES.

19:04:41 THE COUNCIL TOOK NO REPORTABLE ACTION.

19:04:41 THANK YOU.

19:04:46 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:04:49 >> City Mgr. Shackelford: MADAME MAYOR, IF I MAY, I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE ONE 
19:04:49 ANNOUNCEMENT.

19:04:50 >> Mayor Mei: SURE.

19:04:55 >> I KNOW THERE'S BEEN A GREAT DEAL OF COMMUNITY INTEREST IN THE HOMEKEY 
19:04:57 APPLICATION THAT WE SUBMITTED TO THE STATE.

19:05:02  FOR THE PURCHASE OF MOTEL 6 ON RESEARCH AVENUE FOR THE CONVERSION TO 
19:05:04 PERMANENT SUPPORTIVE HOUSING.

19:05:10 I JUST WANTED TO LET THE COMMUNITY KNOW THAT ALTHOUGH WE'D EXPECTED TO RECEIVE 
19:05:15 WORD IN MID MARCH REGARDING THE FUNDING DECISION, THE STATEHOUSING COMMUNITY 
19:05:20 DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT HAS PUSHED BACK THAT RESPONSE DATE A COUPLE OF TIMES 
19:05:24 NOW DUE TO THE LARGE NUMBER OF APPLICATIONS THAT THEY'D  RECEIVED.

19:05:31 AND SO THE RECENT UPDATE THAT WE HAVE IN TERMS OF TIMING IS THAT WE ADVISED 
19:05:39 THEM THAT OUR PROJECT COULD WAIT UNTIL JULY 2022 TO MOVE FORWARD, WHICH WOULD 
19:05:43 GIVE THE STATE MORE TIME TO SORT THROUGH ALL OF THE DIFFERENT 
19:05:45 APPLICATIONS AND MAKE FUNDING DECISIONS.

19:05:49 THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT WE WON'T HEAR ANYTHING UNTIL JUNE OR JULY.

19:05:53 WE COULD STILL HEAR SOMETHING WITHIN THE NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS.

19:05:56 BUT AT THE LATEST, IT WOULD BE SOMETIME IN JULY.

19:06:02 SO THAT'S WHERE WE STAND, AND AS MORE INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE, WE WILL 
19:06:04 MAKE THAT AVAILABLE ON OUR WEBSITE AND TO THE COUNCIL.

19:06:05 THANK YOU.

19:06:08 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU FOR THAT CLARIFICATION AND UPDATE.

19:06:12 I KNOW THAT WE HAVE SEEN THAT SOME CITIES HAD GOTTEN THEIR APPROVAL, SO 
19:06:14 WE WERE WAITING FOR FEEDBACK EITHER WAY.

19:06:17 SO NEXT IS THE CONSENT CALENDAR.

19:06:22 AND THOSE ARE ITEMS THAT WILL BE PASSED WITH ONE COUNCIL VOTE AND THE STAFF 
19:06:23 RECOMMENDATION WILL STAND.

19:06:29 ANY MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC WISHING TO PULL AN ITEM CAN DO SO BY PRESSING THE 
19:06:34 RAISE HAND ICON OR PRESSING STAR NINE.

19:06:38 IS THERE ANY MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC --

19:06:42 >> Ms. Gauthier: JOHN HINDS AND KELLY ABREU HAVE RAISED HANDS.

19:06:44 WE'LL CHECK TO SEE WHICH ITEMS.

19:06:47 MR. HINDS?

19:06:48 >> 2E, COUNCIL RETREAT.

19:06:50 >> Ms. Gauthier: THANK YOU.

19:06:51 WE'LL COME BACK TO THAT.

19:06:54 MR. ABREU?

19:06:56 >> 2E, COUNCIL RETREAT.

19:07:01 >> Ms. Gauthier: THANK YOU.

19:07:03 MR. BEEKMAN?

19:07:07 >> HI.

19:07:08 BLAIR BEEKMAN HERE.

19:07:10 HAPPY APRIL TO EVERYONE.

19:07:18 I'M INTERESTED IN THE MICROSOFT ITEM.

19:07:24 I DON'T QUITE KNOW ITS NUMBER, IT'S C, LETTER C.

19:07:29 AND I THINK THERE'S ONE OTHER ITEM I'M INTERESTED IN HERE, REAL QUICKLY.

19:07:38 OH, THERE'S ONE ABOUT -- I THINK PUBLIC SURVEY -- SURVEYS OF THE PUBLIC, IS 
19:07:41 THAT A CONSENT CAL TAR ITEM?

19:07:44  CALENDAR ITEM?

19:07:47 

19:07:48 >> Ms. Gauthier: THAT'S NEAR THE END OF THE AGENDA.

19:07:51 .

19:07:54 WE'LL COME BACK TO THE CONSENT ITEM AND OTHER ITEMS.

19:07:56 >> Mayor Mei: VICE MAYOR SALWAN, YOU HAVE YOUR HAND RAISED.

19:08:00 >> Vice Mayor Salwan: I'D LIKE TO MOVE CONSENT ITEM WITH THE EXCEPTION OF 
19:08:01 ITEMS 2C AND 2E.

19:08:03 >> Councilmember Jones: MADAME MAYOR?

19:08:04 >> Mayor Mei: YES.

19:08:10 >> Councilmember Jones: IF THERE ARE NO QUESTIONS FROM COUNCIL OR NO PUBLIC 
19:08:14 COMMENT, ARE WE ABLE TO ADD ITEM 7C TO THE CONSENT CALENDAR AS WELL?

19:08:24 >> Mayor Mei: I WOULD HAVE TO GET THAT CLARIFICATION FROM OUR CITY ATTORNEY.

19:08:28 >> MR. ALVARADO:  THAT IS NOT A PUBLIC HEARING ITEM SO IT CAN BE MOVED, IT 
19:08:31 CAN BE MOVED TO CONSENT CALENDAR THIS EVENING, IF THAT IS THE PLEASURE OF 
19:08:32 THE COUNCIL.

19:08:37 >> Ms. Gauthier: AND WE DON'T HAVE ANY PUBLIC SPEAKERS THAT WANT TO SPEAK TO 
19:08:38 ITEM 7C.

19:08:43 IT'S THE CONSIDERATION AND ADOPTION OF THE 2022 LEGISLATIVE GUIDING 
19:08:44 PRINCIPLES AND PRIORITIES.

19:08:50 >> Vice Mayor Salwan: SO WE CAN ADD THAT AS WELL?

19:08:58 >> Ms. Gauthier: MS. DANZ, ARE YOU RAISING YOUR HAND --

19:09:01 >> Councilmember Kassan: EXCUSE ME, I DON'T AGREE WITH MOVING THE 
19:09:07  LEGISLATIVE AGENDA.

19:09:13 >> Mayor Mei: I SEE YOUR HAND IS RAISED -- OKAY --

19:09:14 >> Councilmember Kassan: SORRY, CAN YOU HEAR ME?

19:09:14 >> Mayor Mei: I CAN.

19:09:16 I'M JUST TRYING TO SEE.

19:09:21 SO YOU'D LIKE TO OBJECT TO 7C?

19:09:30 >> Councilmember Kassan: IS THERE A REQUEST TO MOVE THE LEGISLATIVE ITEM 
19:09:31 TO CONSENT?

19:09:32 >> Mayor Mei: YES.

19:09:34 >> Councilmember Kassan: I DON'T AGREE WITH THAT.

19:09:36 >> Councilmember Jones:  -- MOTION.

19:09:41 >> Mayor Mei: I ALSO SAW  MS. DANZ HAD HER HAND RAISED BUT I WASN'T SURE, 
19:09:43 SORRY, I WAS TRYING TO LOOK FOR THAT.

19:09:47 >> Ms. Gauthier: WE NO LONGER HAVE HANDS RAISED.

19:09:48 >> Mayor Mei: OKAY.

19:09:57 SO CITY ATTORNEY RAFAEL -- CITY ATTORNEY ALVARADO, THEN WITH 7C BEING 
19:10:02 ASKED TO BE LEFT ON THE REGULAR AGENDA ITEMS, SO WE'RE GOING TO KEEP THAT 
19:10:02 OFF.

19:10:06 SO IT'S THE CONSENT CALENDAR, I BELIEVE, VICE MAYOR SALWAN, THAT YOU 
19:10:11 MADE THE MOTION, EXCLUDING THE ITEMS THAT HAVE BEEN ASKED TO BE PULLED, 
19:10:12 WHICH WERE  ITEMS --

19:10:14 >> Ms. Gauthier: 2C AND 2E.

19:10:16 >> Vice Mayor Salwan: THAT'S CORRECT.

19:10:20 >> Ms. Gauthier: AND THERE WAS A SECOND BY --

19:10:21 >> Mayor Mei: COUNCILMEMBER JONES.

19:10:23 >> Ms. Gauthier: OKAY, THANK  YOU.

19:10:25 >> Mayor Mei: MAY I HAVE A ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE.

19:10:27 >> Ms. Gauthier: YES, MADAME MAYOR.

19:10:30 COUNCILMEMBER COX, AYE.

19:10:35 COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, AYE.

19:10:38 COUNCILMEMBER JONES, AYE.

19:10:42 VICE MAYOR SALWAN, AYE.

19:10:45 MAYOR MEI, AYE.

19:10:49 >> Mayor Mei: SO THE CONSENT CALENDAR PASSES UNANIMOUSLY WITH THE EXCEPTION 
19:10:51 OF ITEMS 2C AND  2E.

19:10:53 AT THIS TIME.

19:10:58 AND NEXT -- AND THOSE WILL BE CONSIDERED AFTER -- ALONG WITH ORAL 
19:11:01 COMMUNICATIONS, AFTER ORAL COMMUNICATIONS.

19:11:04 NEXT THIS EVENING IS CEREMONIAL ITEMS.

19:11:10 AND I'D LIKE TO SHARE A PROCLAMATION FOR FAIR HOUSING MONTH FOR APRIL 2022.

19:11:24  WHEREAS, THE PRINCIPLE OF FAIR HOUSING IS NOT ONLY PROTECTED BY FEDERAL AND 
19:11:25 STATE LAW, BUT A BASIC NEED AND ENTITLEMENT OF ALL PEOPLES; AND 
19:11:30 WHEREAS, THIS YEAR WE CELEBRATE THE 54TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ENACTMENT OF 
19:11:31 THE FEDERAL FAIR HOUSING ACT OF 1968 (TITLE VIII OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT), 
19:11:36 WHICH STATES THAT DISCRIMINATION IN THE SALE AND RENTAL OF HOUSING IS ILLEGAL 
19:11:37 WHEN BASED ON RACE COLOR, RELIGION, SEX, NATIONAL ORIGIN, FAMILIAL STATUS, 
19:11:43 AND DISABILITY; AND WHEREAS, THE CALIFORNIA FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING 
19:11:47 ACT STATUTES ADDITIONALLY PROTECT CITIZENS AGAINST HOUSING 
19:11:53 DISCRIMINATION ON THE BASIS OF AGE, MARITAL STATUS, SEXUAL ORIENTATION, 
19:11:55 GENDER IDENTITY, IMMIGRATION STATUS, VETERAN STATUS SOURCE OF INCOME, AND 
19:12:05 ALL OTHER ARBITRARY FORMS OF DISCRIMINATION; AND WHEREAS, AS A 
19:12:06 COMMUNITY WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE GOALS OF ECONOMIC PROGRESS AND 
19:12:09 COMPETITIVENESS ARE BEST SERVED BY AFFIRMATIVELY FURTHERING FAIR HOUSING 
19:12:20 THOUGH PROMOTING DIVERSE, INCLUSIVE COMMUNITIES, WITH EQUAL ACCESS TO GOOD 
19:12:23 JOBS, SCHOOLS, HEALTH CARE, TRANSPORTATION, AND HOUSING; AND 
19:12:26 WHEREAS, THE CITY OF FREMONT SUPPORTS FAIR HOUSING EFFORTS TO ELIMINATE 
19:12:29 DISCRIMINATION IN HOUSING AND RECOGNIZES THE BENEFITS OF PROJECT

19:12:38 OWNERS ON FEDERAL AND STATE HOUSING LAWS, AND TO INVESTIGATE COMPLAINTS OF 
19:12:45 ILLEGAL HOUSING DISCRIMINATION IN FREMONT; AND WHEREAS, IN ORDER TO 
19:12:49 HEIGHTEN PUBLIC AWARENESS, THE CITY OF FREMONT WISHES TO FOCUS PUBLIC

19:13:08 ORGANIZATIONS TO CELEBRATE THE VALUE OF HARMONIOUS, INCLUSIVE, AND DIVERSE 
19:13:12 COMMUNITIES OF NEIGHBORS AND TO SUPPORT THE GOAL OF EQUAL HOUSING OPPORTUNITY 
19:13:15 FOR ALL PEOPLE.

19:13:19 AND ACCEPTING THE PROCLAMATION WILL BE DANIEL WILLIAMS OF THE FAIR HOUSING 
19:13:20 STAFF ATTORNEY FOR PROJECT SENTINEL.

19:13:22 WELCOME THIS EVENING, DANIEL.

19:13:26 >> THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR.

19:13:31 PROJECT SENTINEL GREATLY APPRECIATE'S FREMONT'S SUPPORT AS WELL AS YOUR HELP 
19:13:34 TO SPREAD THE WORD ABOUT FAIR HOUSING RIGHTS AND THE FAIR HOUSING SERVICES 
19:13:37 THAT PROJECT SENTINEL IS ABLE TO PROVIDE TO THE RESIDENTS OF FREMONT, 
19:13:39 SO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS.

19:13:40 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU FOR  JOINING US THIS EVENING.

19:13:48 THANK YOU FOR SHARING THIS AWARENESS.

19:13:51 IT'S SOMETHING WE TRULY APPRECIATE THE CONTINUED EFFORT IN.

19:13:55 WE WILL LOOK FORWARD TO ALWAYS SUPPORTING THESE VALUES AND ENSURING 
19:13:58 THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE STAND FIRMLY BY AS A CITY.

19:14:00 THANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR TIME THIS EVENING.

19:14:01 >> THANK YOU.

19:14:03 >> Mayor Mei: CONGRATULATIONS.

19:14:05 NEXT IS ORAL COMMUNICATIONS.

19:14:10 AND THIS IS FOR ITEMS THAT ARE NOT ON THE AGENDA THIS EVENING.

19:14:13 AND I SEE A COUPLE HANDS RAISED.

19:14:22 SO IF WE COULD PUT I GUESS 3 MINUTES FOR EACH ONE, I THINK WE HAVE TWO 
19:14:22 HANDS RIGHT NOW.

19:14:30 COULD WE START WITH JOHN HINDS, EVERYONE?

19:14:31 >> HELLO, EVERYONE.

19:14:33 >> Ms. Gauthier: WE HAVE MORE HANDS.

19:14:36 >> Mayor Mei: LET ME FIGURE OUT THE TIMING.

19:14:37 HOW MANY DO WE HAVE?

19:14:46 I THINK WE CAN STILL GO WITH 3 FOR NOW.

19:14:50 OR LET'S MAKE IT 2 MINUTES, BECAUSE WE WANT TO HAVE SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT THE 
19:14:50 OTHER PIECES.

19:14:56 >> Ms. Gauthier: OKAY,  2 MINUTES?

19:14:56 >> Mayor Mei: YES.

19:14:58 WELCOME, JOHN.

19:14:59 THANK YOU FOR COMING THIS EVENING.

19:15:01 >> HELLO, EVERYONE.

19:15:06 SEEING OTHER PEOPLE'S FACES AND HEARING THEIR VOICES HAVE BEEN BASIC PARTS OF 
19:15:10 HUMAN  INTERACTION SINCE FOREVER.

19:15:13 BUT FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS, WE'VE HAD MASKING AND DISTANCING RULES WHICH 
19:15:18 HAVE BROKEN THAT PICTURE TO SOME EXTENT AND COULD EXPLAIN SOME OF THE 
19:15:22 PATHOLOGIES WE'VE SEEN AROUND US LATELY.

19:15:27 ALTHOUGH MEETING REMOTELY -- ZOOM CAN COMPENSATE PRETTY WELL WHEN PEOPLE 
19:15:32 HAVE THEIR CAMERAS AND MICROPHONES TURNED ON BUT WE KNOW FOR LARGER ONES 
19:15:35 LIKE THIS ONE, WE RUN INTO BANDWIDTH PROBLEMS AND PEOPLE'S INTERACTION 
19:15:36 BECOMES LIMITED AGAIN.

19:15:40 LIKE LAST WEEK, I THINK WE LOST A COMMENT FROM KELLY IN MID SENTENCE 
19:15:41 THAT WAS AUDIO ONLY.

19:15:43 THIS WOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED IN THE COUNCIL CHAMBERS.

19:15:48 ON THE WHOLE, I THINK THE COUNCIL MEETINGS VIA ZOOM HAVE BEEN RUN PRETTY 
19:15:52 WELL, BUT I HAVE ATTENDED A COUPLE OF OTHER MEETINGS RECENTLY WITH STAFF 
19:15:56 WHEN ZOOM'S MODERATION FEATURES WERE SERIOUSLY OVERUSED.

19:16:02 PARTICIPANTS WERE INVISIBLE AND INAUDIBLE, AND WE COULDN'T EVEN SEE 
19:16:07 PEOPLE'S WRITTEN QUESTIONS UNTIL AFTER THEY WERE ACCEPTED BY A MODERATOR.

19:16:11 THAT'S ABOUT AS DISTANT AND LIMITED AS INTERACTION CAN BE.

19:16:17 I HEAR THAT THIS PRACTICE  STARTED AFTER AN INCIDENT OF RUDENESS A COUPLE 
19:16:19 MONTHS AGO, BUT I THINK THIS IS THE WRONG SOLUTION TO IT.

19:16:24 ONCE WE IDENTIFY OURSELVES, OUR COMMENTS REFLECT ON US ALONE.

19:16:25 LISTENERS KNOW THAT.

19:16:31 AND GOING OUT OF YOUR WAY TO SHELTER OTHER GROWN-UP FROM MEAN WORDS IS NOT 
19:16:33 REALLY A SHOW OF RESPECT EITHER.

19:16:38 IF THAT'S HOW WE'RE GOING TO USE ZOOM FOR PUBLIC MEETINGS, WE SHOULDN'T BE 
19:16:38 USING IT.

19:16:39 THANK YOU.

19:16:40 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:16:45 NEXT IS JOHN WHALEY.

19:16:46 WELCOME.

19:16:50 >> HELLO, EVERYONE.

19:16:56 YEAH, I LIVE HERE IN THE PARKMONT AREA, AND I WANT TO SPEAK OUT IN SUPPORT OF 
19:17:01 THE SAFE PARKING PROGRAM THAT'S ROLLING OUT NOW AT THE CHURCH IN PARKMONT.

19:17:05 I THINK THE PROGRAM IS GREAT, IT HAS A POSITIVE IMPACT NOT ONLY ON OUR 
19:17:08 UNHOUSED NEIGHBORS BUT ON THE COMMUNITY AT LARGE, AND I THINK THESE PROGRAMS 
19:17:13 LIKE THE SAFE PARKING PROGRAM AS WELL AS PROJECT HOMEKEY ARE CONSISTENT WITH 
19:17:18 THE FREMONT AS A COMPASSIONATE CITY AND THE FREMONT COMPASSIONATE CITY CHARTER 
19:17:22 THAT WAS RATIFIED IN 2016, AND GLAD TO SEE THE CITY IS NOT JUST GIVING IT LIP 
19:17:27 SERVICE BUT ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT, AND  HOMELESSNESS IS A BIG ISSUE, 
19:17:31 AND PROGRAMS LIKE THE SAFE PARKING PROGRAM AND PROJECT HOMEKEY ARE JUST 
19:17:34 DROPS IN THE BUCKET, BUT THEY DO MAKE A POSITIVE IMPACT.

19:17:39 SOME OF THE PARTICIPANTS IN THE PROGRAMS, THEY'VE LOST THEIR HOUSING 
19:17:46 DUE TO MEDICAL BILLS, OTHERS LOST A JOB, SOME CARING FOR A FAMILY MEMBER, 
19:17:50 SOME ARE ON FIXED INCOMES AND HAVE GOTTEN PRICED OUT OR, YOU KNOW, 
19:17:55 VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND THEY'RE JUST ESCAPING THOSE SITUATIONS.

19:17:59 AND THE TRUTH IS THAT MANY OF US ARE JUST ONE MEDICAL EMERGENCY OR ONE JOB 
19:18:05 LOSS OR, YOU KNOW, FROM ONE TRAGEDY FROM BEING UNHOUSED OURSELVES, AND 
19:18:12 THERE'S A SMALL GROUP OF NIMBYs WHO WANT TO SHUT DOWN THE PROGRAM BUT 
19:18:15 THEY'RE REALLY A SMALL MINORITY AMONG MY NEIGHBORHOOD HERE.

19:18:20 THEY'RE ALSO REALLY  DISINGENUOUS, THEY TRY TO RAISE UP FALSE BARRIERS OR 
19:18:22 CONSTRAINTS TO TRY TO GET IT OUT OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

19:18:28 I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT THEY'RE A TINY MINORITY AND AN  OVERWHELMING MAJORITY 
19:18:29 IS VERY POSITIVE ON THESE PROGRAMS.

19:18:35 AGAIN, THESE ARE JUST DROPS IN THE BUCKET, BUT I'M VERY HAPPY TO SEE THAT 
19:18:39 THE CITY COUNCIL IS MOVING IN THIS DIRECTION AND CITY OF FREMONT IS 
19:18:39 MOVING IN THESE DIRECTIONS.

19:18:43 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU, BL WHALEY.

19:18:47 NEXT FOR THE SPEAKER IS MARIE H.

19:18:49 WELCOME.

19:18:53 >> THANK YOU.

19:18:59 MY NAME IS MARIE HUGHES, AND I AM A MEMBER OF LEADERSHIP TEAM FOR FREMONT 
19:19:00 FOR EVERYONE.

19:19:04 FREMONT FOR EVERYONE WOULD LIKE TO INVITE ALL INTERESTED PARTIES TO A 
19:19:06 HOUSING ELEMENT WORKSHOP THAT WE ARE PLANNING.

19:19:12 THIS EVENT WILL FEATURE A PRESENTATION BY THE CITY AND ADDITIONAL INPUT FROM 
19:19:14  CALIFORNIA -- AND ABODE  SERVICES.

19:19:20 THIS IS A GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO FIND OUT WHAT THE HECK THE HOUSING ELEMENT 
19:19:25 ACTUALLY IS AND ALSO FOR RESIDENTS TO GIVE THEIR INPUT INTO FREMONT'S FUTURE.

19:19:31 MORE INFORMATION WILL BE POSTED ON OUR WEBSITE AND OUR FACEBOOK PAGE IN THE 
19:19:34 NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS, BUT IN THE MEANTIME, WE WOULD LIKE PEOPLE TO SAVE 
19:19:34 THE DATE.

19:19:41 IT'S APRIL 27TH AT 7:00 P.M., AND YOU CAN REGISTER FOR THE ZOOM MEETING AT 
19:19:51  BITLEY/FFE-HOUSINGELEMENT.

19:19:52 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:19:57 THE NEXT SPEAKER IS MINHAJ M.

19:19:57 WELCOME.

19:20:08 >> HELLO, MADAME MAYOR AND EVERYBODY ELSE, THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME THE 
19:20:08 OPPORTUNITY TO TALK OVER HERE.

19:20:17 I'M HERE TODAY IN OPPOSITION OF THE 5G TOWER THAT IS GETTING BUILT IN 
19:20:19 DISTRICT 6 IN FREMONT.

19:20:25 DEPARTMENT -- BUILDING 202-10-6600.

19:20:33 I AM LIKE SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF 10 OTHER HOMES ON THE STREET, AND SEVERAL 
19:20:40 OTHER RESIDENTS HERE WHO ARE IN OPPOSITION OF  HAVING -- BECAUSE OF 
19:20:45 THE 5G RADIATION CONCERNS, HEALTH CONCERNS BECAUSE OF -- AND WE HAVE A 
19:20:50 LOT OF KIDS ON THIS STREET AND PARTICULARLY MY KID IS DIAGNOSED WITH 
19:20:54 DIABETES, AND WE ARE LIKE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE WAY THAT WHOLE 
19:21:02 PROJECT IS GOING, AND WE WOULD LIKE YOU TO IMMEDIATELY STOP ANY PROGRESS ON 
19:21:04 THIS.

19:21:12 THE REPORT ATTACHED BY THE -- WHEN THEY STARTED BUILDING THIS PROJECT, AND 
19:21:16 MENTIONED IN THIS PROJECT THAT IN THE IMMEDIATE PROXIMITY, THERE WILL BE 
19:21:20 HIGH RADIATION AND MY HOME IS LIKE JUST NEXT TO IT.

19:21:28 THERE ARE A LOT OF CONCERNS AND THERE IS NO SCIENTIFIC PROOF THAT THERE IS 
19:21:32 NO HARMFUL RADIATIONS FROM THE 5G.

19:21:38 A LOT OF SCIENTISTS ARE STILL WAITING FOR THE GRANTS TO DO THE RESEARCH, SO 
19:21:42 WE HUMBLY ASK THE CITY TO TAKE THIS INTO CONSIDERATION, STOP IMMEDIATE 
19:21:49 WORK AND -- WHO COULD DO RADIATION TESTING, AND LIKE JUST ENSURE THAT WE 
19:21:51 ALL ARE SAFE BEFORE THEY MAKE ANY PROGRESS.

19:21:55 THAT'S PRETTY MUCH -- THANKS A LOT.

19:21:55 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:21:58 NEXT SPEAKER IS KELLY.

19:22:00 WELCOME, KELLY ABREU.

19:22:03 >> THANK YOU.

19:22:09 THIS COUNCIL DISCUSSED NORMS AND PROTOCOLS RELATED TO THE ISSUANCE OF 
19:22:13 PROCLAMATIONS AND RESOLUTIONS AT ITS RETREAT RECENTLY.

19:22:19 NOW CEREMONIAL RESOLUTIONS ARE SUPPOSED TO COVER  NON-CONTROVERSIAL ROUTINE 
19:22:26  MATTERS SUCH AS A COMMENDATION FOR COMMUNITY SERVICE OR A PROCLAMATION -- 
19:22:28 THE PROCLAMATION OF FAIR HOUSING MONTH THAT YOU JUST DID.

19:22:36 BUT LAST WEEK, THE COUNCIL VOTED TO APPROVE A SUPPOSEDLY CEREMONIAL 
19:22:38 RESOLUTION IN SUPPORT OF A NEW TRAUMA CENTER.

19:22:46 THE CITY COUNCIL WELCOMED ONE SPEAKER, OPENED THE DOOR TO -- LOBBIED FOR THE 
19:22:47 PROPOSAL.

19:22:52 THE COUNCIL LOCKED THE DOORS TO ANYONE WHO WAS OPPOSED TO THE PROJECT.

19:22:57 THIS RESOLUTION SHOULD HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED AS A SEPARATE ITEM ON THE 
19:23:03 AGENDA OR ON THE CONSENT CALENDAR, OR IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN PLACED ON THE 
19:23:07 CONSENT CALENDAR, BECAUSE THE RESOLUTION WAS NOT PURELY CEREMONIAL.

19:23:13 BOTH THE BROWN ACT AND THE U.S. CONSTITUTION REQUIRE THAT THIS COUNCIL 
19:23:22 MUST ALLOW ALL SIDES TO SPEAK, NOT JUST BRING IN  SELECTED FRIENDLY INVITEES 
19:23:26 WHO ARE PROPONENTS OF THE PROJECT AND INTERESTED PARTIES.

19:23:32 NOT JUST THROW WHATEVER YOU WANT ON TO THE CEREMONIAL RESOLUTION AND 
19:23:39 CEREMONIAL PROCLAMATION SECTION, AND THEN APPROVE WHATEVER YOU WANT WITHOUT 
19:23:41  ALLOWING ANY DISSENT.

19:23:52 THIS IS REALLY UNLAWFUL, AND IT'S QUITE -- IT CANNOT BE ALLOWED TO CONTINUE.

19:23:52 THANK YOU.

19:23:58 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:23:59 NEXT SPEAKER IS BLAIR BEEKMAN.

19:24:03 >> HI.

19:24:04 THANK YOU.

19:24:09 I'M GOING TO HAVE TO LEAVE EARLY TONIGHT, SO I'M GOING TO HAVE TO 
19:24:15 [INAUDIBLE] MY THOUGHTS ABOUT CONSENT IN THE REGULAR GENERAL PUBLIC COMMENT 
19:24:15 HERE.

19:24:22 FIRST VERY MUCH OF A THANK YOU TO COUNCILPERSON KASSAN WHO LAST WEEK 
19:24:26 SPOKE VERY ELOQUENTLY ABOUT WHAT THE FUTURE OF PORTABLE HOUSING IDEAS COULD 
19:24:27 BE FOR FREMONT.

19:24:29 AND IN FACT, FOR THE BAY AREA.

19:24:36 SHE'S LOOKING FOR NEW IDEAS AND NEW WAYS AND NEW FORMULAS TO ADDRESS OUR 
19:24:39 CURRENT ISSUES, AND I THANK HER MUCH FOR THAT, FOR THOSE EFFORTS.

19:24:45 I TRY TO MENTION OFTEN THE IMPORTANCE OF MIXED INCOME  IDEAS, AND ITS 
19:24:53 FLEXIBILITY, THAT I THINK IT ALMOST -- SITUATION AND JUST OFFER OURSELVES 
19:24:59 MUCH MORE CHOICES IN HOW WE DECIDE THE FUTURE OF HOW REALLY LOW INCOME, VERY 
19:25:05 -- EXTREMELY LOW INCOME AND EXTREMELY LOW INCOME HOUSING CAN BE PLACED 
19:25:07 WITHIN MODERATE AND LOW INCOME HOUSING.

19:25:14 AND I THINK THAT'S A -- [INAUDIBLE] BAY AREA THAT I HOPE WE'RE LEARNING SOME 
19:25:15 IMPORTANT LESSONS.

19:25:18 GOOD LUCK HOW WE CAN DO THAT.

19:25:22 OTHER CITIES WITHIN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ARE LEARNING IMPORTANT 
19:25:24 STUDY SESSIONS ON MIXED INCOME IDEAS.

19:25:25 THE BAY AREA IS NOT.

19:25:30 IT'S KIND OF UP TO OURSELVES TO REALLY LEARN HOW TO INCORPORATE THOSE THINGS.

19:25:35 GOOD LUCK ON THE EFFORT, AND GOOD LUCK WITH YOUR HOMEKEY PROJECT IDEAS.

19:25:48 I KNOW YOU'RE DISAPPOINTED AND WE WERE VERY MUCH HOPING FOR ONE -- ALREADY 
19:25:50 GOOD PRACTICES AND HOW WE CAN HOUSE THE UNHOUSED.

19:25:54 THERE'S GOING TO BE MUCH MORE SUBSIDY FUNDING AVAILABLE THAT CAN ACTUALLY 
19:25:56 SUBSIDIZE AND HOUSE UNHOUSED PEOPLE.

19:26:00 AND WE HAVE TO LEARN HOW TO  BETTER WORK PROGRAMS, WE ALREADY KNOW HOW TO 
19:26:05 DO WELL, AND WE DO THAT, WE'LL BE IN GOOD SHAPE.

19:26:09 THAT CAN HELP THE HOMEKEY PROJECT, AND THANKS FOR THE AGENDA TODAY.

19:26:10 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:26:19 I BELIEVE THAT IS THE LAST OF THE PUBLIC COMMENT, AND AT THIS TIME, I'M 
19:26:22 GOING TO CLOSE PUBLIC COMMENT AND RETURN TO THE ITEMS THAT WERE PULLED 
19:26:25 FROM THE CONSENT CALENDAR.

19:26:30 THE FIRST ONE IS ITEM 2C, AND I BELIEVE THE SPEAKER IS BLAIR BEEKMAN.

19:26:37 THIS IS CONCERNING THE MICROSOFT ENTERPRISE AGREEMENT AND THE ABILITY 
19:26:41 TO ANSWER A THREE-YEAR MICROSOFT ENTERPRISE CONTRACT WITH DELL 
19:26:41 MARKETING.

19:26:44 >> Ms. Gauthier: ONE MINUTE FOR CONSENT CALENDAR ITEMS.

19:26:49 DID MR. BEEKMAN DROP OFF?

19:26:50 >> Mayor Mei: I'M LOOKING FOR HIM.

19:27:02 I BELIEVE HE'S NO LONGER --

19:27:05 >> Ms. Gauthier: I'M NOT SEEING HIM ANY LONGER AS AN ATTENDEE.

19:27:10 >> Mayor Mei: COUNCILMEMBER JONES, I SAW YOU PRESSED --

19:27:12 >> Councilmember Jones: I BELIEVE COUNCILMEMBER COX WAS GOING TO MAKE A 
19:27:13 MOTION AND I WILL SECOND.

19:27:14 >> Mayor Mei: OKAY.

19:27:14 THANK YOU.

19:27:18 >> Councilmember Cox: BUT I AGREE.

19:27:28 >> Mayor Mei: SO WE'VE HAD A MOTION AND SECOND FOR THE  ITEM 2C, WHICH IS THE 
19:27:31 MICROSOFT ENTERPRISE AGREEMENT.

19:27:37 LET ME CHECK, THERE'S SOMEBODY WITH A HAND RAISED.

19:27:40 ARE YOU SPEAKING ON ITEM 2C AS IN CAT?

19:27:50 >> ACTUALLY I WAS THINKING ABOUT SPEAKING ON ANOTHER ITEM, PREVIOUS 
19:27:55 ITEM REGARDING THE PORTABLE HOWING.

19:27:58 HOWEVER THE ITEM HAS PASSED, SO THEREFORE --

19:28:00 >> Ms. Gauthier: WE'RE PAST ORAL COMMUNICATIONS NOW.

19:28:01 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:28:03 SO -- OKAY.

19:28:09 WE'LL GO BACK, WE HAVE THE ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE, ON THIS ITEM, 2C.

19:28:11 >> Ms. Gauthier: YES, MADAME MAYOR.

19:28:13 COUNCILMEMBER COX, AYE.

19:28:16 COUNCILMEMBER SOMEHOW, AYE.

19:28:18 COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, AYE.

19:28:20 COUNCILMEMBER JONES, AYE.

19:28:23 COUNCILMEMBER KENG, AYE.

19:28:25 VICE MAYOR SALWAN, AYE.

19:28:27 MAYOR MEI, AYE.

19:28:29 >> Mayor Mei: ITEM 2C PASSES UNANIMOUSLY.

19:28:36 NEXT IS ITEM 2E AND IN ELEPHANT.

19:28:40 AND THAT WAS THE FEBRUARY 2022 CITY COUNCIL RETREAT.

19:28:46 THIS IS REGARDING ACCEPTANCE OF THE COUNCIL RETREAT REPORT, AND THE 
19:28:48 COUNCIL IDENTIFIED PRIORITIES.

19:28:50 FIRST SPEAKER --

19:28:52 >> Ms. Gauthier: MR. HINDS AND MR. ABREU.

19:28:54 >> Mayor Mei: YES, WELCOME.

19:28:55 >> HELLO, EVERYONE.

19:29:01 ON THE WHOLE, I THINK THESE RETREATS ARE GOOD THINGS, GIVING STAFF SOME -- 
19:29:05 IN ADVANCE HELPS CUT DOWN ON THE NEED FOR REWORK LATER.

19:29:10 I DO WANT TO -- TEASE ARE ALL GOOD THINGS TO WORK ON BUT I THINK THEY ARE 
19:29:14 NOT SUPER TIGHTLY ALIGNED WITH THE PRIORITIES OF FREEMENTS' RESIDENTS.

19:29:16 COULD I BE WRONG ABOUT THAT?

19:29:21 INCONCEIVABLE, I KNOW, BUT IF THE CITY GOT IT RIGHT, THEN YOU MUST HAVE SOME 
19:29:22 GOOD INFORMATION ABOUT THE WISHES OF RESIDENTS HERE.

19:29:24 ONE EXAMPLE, TRAFFIC CONGESTION.

19:29:30 ON NEXT DOOR, THE QUICKEST WAY TO GATHER LOTS OF IRATE PEOPLE IS TO 
19:29:35 BRING UP ELIMINATION OF RIGHT TURN LANES.

19:29:38 WE SUDDENLY IMPAIR THE MOBILITY OF MOST PEOPLE IN TOWN.

19:29:40 BUT THAT'S JUST ONE EXAMPLE.

19:29:46 MY POINT IS, WE NEED A WAY TO MAKE SURE THAT THE CITY'S PRIORITIES WERE 
19:29:48 ALIGNED WITH THOSE OF THE CITY'S RESIDENTS.

19:29:51 BECAUSE IF THE PRIORITIES AREN'T COMING FROM THE PEOPLE, WHERE SHOULD THEY 
19:29:52 COME FROM?

19:29:52 THANK YOU.

19:29:53 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:30:02 NEXT SPEAKER IS KELLY ABREU ON THIS ITEM.

19:30:07 >> SO IN THE COUNCIL RETREAT, IT WAS SAID THAT THE NORMS ARE THE 
19:30:11 OVERARCHING GUIDING PRINCIPLES FOR COUNCIL'S WORK TOGETHER AND GOOD 
19:30:17 GOVERNANCE AND TEAM WORK ARE NEEDED FOR US TO FULFILL PROMISES TO VOTERS AND 
19:30:27 REPRESENT RESIDENTS, AND -- BUT TRUST AND FACTUAL ACCURACY ARE PREREQUISITES 
19:30:34 FOR GOOD GOVERNANCE, DEMANDING THE CLOSURE OF MISSION PEAK, EXPECTS 
19:30:41 LOYALTY, AND -- CITY ATTORNEY, CITY MANAGER AND COMMUNICATIONS STAFF OUT 
19:30:41 TO DRY.

19:30:45 COUNCIL HAS TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY NOW FOR  MISREPRESENTING ITS SPONSORSHIP 
19:30:51 OF THE PARK CLOSURE, AND STOP TARNISHING THE REPUTATION OF THE CITY 
19:30:58 BY USING LIES,  MISREPRESENTATIONS AND  FALSEHOODS THAT ARE EASILY TIS PROVEN.

19:31:03 YOU NEED TO SPEAK UP WHEN YOU NEED A COURSE CORRECTION.

19:31:03 THANK YOU.

19:31:09 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:31:13 LAST SPEAKER ON ITEM 2E AS IN ELEPHANT, AND I SEE COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, YOU 
19:31:14 HAVE YOUR HAND RAISED.

19:31:16 >> Councilmember Kassan: YES, I'M SORRY.

19:31:25 WE HAVE SCIENTIFIC SURVEYS THAT HAVE BEEN COMPLETED REGARDING THE CONCERNS 
19:31:29 OF COMMUNITY RESIDENTS, SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT WE DO TAKE THOSE 
19:31:31 INTO ACCOUNT WHEN WE DECIDE ON OUR PRIORITIES.

19:31:32 THANK YOU.

19:31:33 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:31:43 WOULD YOU ALSO LIKE TO MAKE A MOTION OR -- SINCE YOU HAD YOUR HAND RAID?

19:31:46  HAND RAISED?

19:31:49 >> Councilmember Kassan: YES, I WILL MOVE THE ITEM THE.

19:31:49 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:31:51 DO WE HAVE A SECOND?

19:31:54 JONES I'LL SECOND.

19:31:56 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU, COUNCILMEMBER JONES.

19:32:01 ROLL CALL VOTE ON ITEM 2E AS IN ELEPHANT.

19:32:05 >> Ms. Gauthier: COUNCILMEMBER COX, AYE.

19:32:06 COUNCILMEMBER SHAO, AYE.

19:32:09 COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, AYE.

19:32:12 COUNCILMEMBER JONES, AYE.

19:32:15 COUNCILMEMBER KENG, AYE.

19:32:16 VICE MAYOR SALWAN, AYE.

19:32:19 MAYOR MEI, AYE.

19:32:23 SO THAT CONSENT CALENDAR ITEM PASSES UNANIMOUSLY.

19:32:25 THANK YOU FOR THE COMMENTS FROM ALL.

19:32:40 NEXT ON OUR AGENDA ITEM THIS EVENING IS THE ITEM 7A, WHICH HAVE THE VACATION 
19:32:44 OF THE EASEMENT AT 38631 FREMONT BOULEVARD.

19:32:50 THIS IS -- WE FOUND THIS ACTION IS TO BE EXEMPT FROM CEQA, AND WE HAVE 
19:32:59 ADOPTED A RESOLUTION, AND I BELIEVE THAT OUR PUBLIC WORKS DIRECTOR, HANS 
19:33:04 LARSEN, AND OUR ASSOCIATE CIVIL ENGINEER, JAN WONG, ARE HERE THIS 
19:33:04 EVENING.

19:33:11 ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS OR PRESENTATION THAT YOU WANT TO SHARE?

19:33:14 >> MAYOR MEI, THERE'S NO PRESENTATION ON THIS ITEM.

19:33:15 IT'S RELATIVELY ROUTINE.

19:33:17 STAFF IS AVAILABLE FOR ANY QUESTIONS.

19:33:23 >> Councilmember Jones: MADAME MAYOR, IF WE HAVE NO OTHER INTEREST FROM 
19:33:27 COUNCILMEMBERS OR THE PUBLIC, I WOULD MOVE TO APPROVE THIS ITEM.

19:33:29 >> Councilmember Cox: SECOND.

19:33:31 >> Mayor Mei: MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER JONES, SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER COX.

19:33:37 SEEING NO OTHER COMMENTS, I'M CLOSING THE PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD.

19:33:44 AND IF WE CAN HAVE A ROLL CALL ON ITEM 7A, WHICH IS THE VACATION OF PUBLIC 
19:33:46 UTILITIESE M.

19:33:48 >> Ms. Gauthier: COUNCILMEMBER COX, AYE.

19:33:50 COUNCILMEMBER SHAO, AYE.

19:33:53 COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, AYE.

19:33:57 COUNCILMEMBER JONES, AYE.

19:33:58 COUNCILMEMBER KENG, AYE.

19:34:00 VICE MAYOR SALWAN, AYE.

19:34:03 MAYOR MEI, AYE.

19:34:05 >> Mayor Mei: SO ITEM 7A PASSES UNANIMOUSLY.

19:34:14 NEXT IS ITEM 7B, WHICH IS THE UNION SANITARY DISTRICT UPDATE.

19:34:21 AND THEY WOULD LIKE TO SHARE SOME UPDATE SHY LIGHTING I GUESS THEIR 
19:34:24 CURRENT INITIATIVES AND OUR PRESENTATION THIS EVENING WILL BE BY 
19:34:30 THE UNION SANITARY DISTRICT SANITATION MANAGER PAUL ELDRIDGE.

19:34:31 THANK YOU FOR JOINING US THIS EVENING.

19:34:35 >> THANK YOU, MAYOR, MEMBERS OF COUNCIL AND CITY STAFF.

19:34:36 APPRECIATE BEING HERE THIS EVENING.

19:34:40 BEAR WITH ME ONE MOMENT AS I ATTEMPT TO SHARE MY SCREEN.

19:34:55 AND LET'S SEE IF YOU CAN BEAR WITH ME ONE MOMENT.

19:34:57 >> Mayor Mei: SURE.

19:35:00 IF NOT, DO WE HAVE THE PRESENTATION ALSO?

19:35:10 FROM THE SIDE OF THE CITY THAT WE CAN ALSO RAISE IN CASE THERE'S ANY -- IT'S 
19:35:10 WORKING PERFECT.

19:35:11 >> THANK YOU.

19:35:12 >> THANK YOU.

19:35:15 >> AGAIN, GOOD EVENING, MAYOR, MEMBERS OF COUNCIL.

19:35:18 THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE THIS EVENING.

19:35:22 IT BEEN A WHILE SINCE WE'VE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO GIVE AN UPDATE TO THE 
19:35:27 FREMONT CITY COUNCIL ON WHAT WE'VE BEEN UP TO OVER HERE AT UNION STAN TRI DISTRICT.

19:35:31 SO I'M GOING TO DO A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE DISTRICT AND SOME STATISTICS FOR 
19:35:35 THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE NOT FAMILIAR WITH SEUN YON SANITARY DISTRICT, GIVE AN 
19:35:40 UPDATE ON SOME THINGS THAT ARE GOING ON IN THE GENERAL WASTEWATER COMMUNITY 
19:35:43 AND THEN FOCUS ON SOME SPECIFIC INITIATIVES HERE AT THE DISTRICT 
19:35:43 ITSELF.

19:35:50 SO WITH THAT, OUR SERVICE AREA AS MANY OF YOU PROBABLY KNOW IS COMPRISED OF 
19:35:55 UNION CITY, NEWARK, AND THE CITY OF FREMONT, AND WE HAVE A FIVE-PERSON 
19:36:00 INDEPENDENTLY ELECTED BOARD AND THE REPRESENTATIVES ARE MANNY FERNANDEZ 
19:36:07 FROM UNION CITY, PAT KITE FROM NEWARK, ANJALI LATHI AND TWO OTHERS FROM 
19:36:08 FREMONT.

19:36:09 SOME DISTRICT DEMOGRAPHICS.

19:36:17 WE'RE ABOUT 60 SQUARE MILES SERVICE AIR, WHICH MORE OR LESSEN COMPASSES 
19:36:26 THE -- IT'S ABOUT 357,000 RESIDENTS, ABOUT 3,000 BUSINESSES, AND WE PROVIDE 
19:36:31 SERVICE TO ABOUT 118,000 -- SERVICE CONNECTIONS.

19:36:35 WE HAVE APPROXIMATELY 17,300  MANHOLES.

19:36:41 YOU MIGHT THINK THAT IS A WEIRD STATISTIC TO PUT IN A PRESENTATION.

19:36:46 WE DID NOT NORMALLY INCLUDE THAT IN PRESENTATIONS BULL PEOPLE ASK AT THE 
19:36:54 END, SO WE FIGURED WE WOULD JUST ACQUIESCE.

19:37:05 WE HAVE 89 PERMITTED INDUSTRIES, LIKE TESLA MOTORS, LAM RESEARCH, WE HAVE A 
19:37:12 SEPARATE DISTARNLG PERMIT THAT WE MANAGE WITH THAT INDUSTRY TO MAKE SURE 
19:37:16 THAT THERE'S NO BYPRODUCTS OR ANYTHING FROM THERE, MANUFACTURING PROCESS, 
19:37:20 THAT MAKES ITS WAY INTO THE SURE THAT REALLY SHOULDN'T BE THERE.

19:37:29 ABOUT 839 MILES OF PIPELINE, WE HAVE OUR 33-ACRE TREATMENT PLANT HERE AT 
19:37:29 UNION CITY.

19:37:39 THAT AVERAGES OUT TO ABOUT 22.86 MILLION GALLONS PER DAY, AND THE 
19:37:53 TREATMENT PLANT CAN HANDLE 33 MILLION -- WE PRODUCE AND BENEFICIALLY RE-USE 
19:37:55 20,000 PLUS WET TONS.

19:37:58 SOME EMERGING TRENDS THAT HAVE BEEN GOING ON IN WASTEWATER, SOME OF YOU 
19:38:04 MAY HAVE HEARD THIS MORE ON A NATIONAL LEVEL, NOT SO MUCH ON A LOCAL LEVEL, 
19:38:07 AND IT HAS TO DO WITH NUTRIENTS AND WATER BODIES.

19:38:14 CHESAPEAKE BAY AND THE -- A LOT OF ATTENTION OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS 
19:38:21 ABOUT HARMFUL ALGAL  BLOOMS, AND EVEN CLOSER TO HOME, OUT IN DISCOVERY BAY A 
19:38:27 FEW YEARS AGO, THEY HAD SOME ISSUES WITH HARMFUL ALGAL BLOOMS, AND IT'S 
19:38:29 PRIMARILY CAUSED BY NUTRIENTS THAT ARE IN THE WATER.

19:38:34 FOR EXAMPLE, NITROGEN, AMMONIA AND A PHOSPHOROUS.

19:38:38 THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY HAS HAD A LONG HISTORY OF HIGH NUTRIENT LOADING AND 
19:38:42 LEVELS, BUT THERE'S BEEN VARIOUS ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS THAT PRECLUDED 
19:38:47 IT FROM BEING A PROBLEM IN THE BAY, AND NOW THERE'S A CONCERN THAT THESE 
19:38:51 ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS WERE GOING AWAY, AND THAT THERE COULD BE A TIPPING 
19:38:59 POINT WHERE MAYBE WE HAVE TO START WORRYING ABOUT HARMFUL ALGAL BLOOMS IN 
19:38:59 THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY.

19:39:05 WE'RE NOT AT THIS POINT YET, THIS IS FUTURE-FORWARD LOOKING, BUT IT IS 
19:39:11 SOMETHING THAT'S ON OUR RADAR, US AND THE STATE AND THE EPA AND THE 
19:39:15 SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY DON'T WANT TO GET TO THE POINT WHERE IT'S CRISIS, WE'RE 
19:39:21  TRYING TO BE PRO EAKTIVE ABOUT THIS.

19:39:29 EACH ONE OF THESE YELLOW DOTS ON THIS MAP REPRESENT ONE OF THOSE 37 
19:39:30 WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANTS.

19:39:34 AND FOR THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS, WE'VE BEEN FUNDING SCIENCE AND TESTING AND 
19:39:41 SAMPLING IN THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY TO TRY TO GET AN IDEA OF JUST WHAT IS THE 
19:39:51  -- HOW MANY UNITS CAN YOU PUT TO THE BAY BEFORE IT BECOMES A PROBLEM?

19:39:56 THE REGULATORY AGENCY, THE STATE AND EPA, WILL THEN USE THAT DATA TO COME 
19:39:57 UP WITH LIMITS.

19:40:02 IN OTHER WORDS, IF WE STAY UNDER THIS LIMIT OF NUTRIENTS, THEN THE BAY WON'T 
19:40:04  HAVE ANY ADVERSE EFFECTS.

19:40:10 AND WE THINK IT'S BEEN A VERY GOOD MODEL OF WORKING COOPERATIVELY, WHEN 
19:40:13 THE REGULATORY AGENCIES, AND WE ARE CONTINUING TO FUND THE SCIENCE AND 
19:40:17 WE'RE USING SCIENCE TO DETERMINE THE NEXT STEPS.

19:40:22 WITH THAT SAID, WE DO EXPECT THAT THERE WILL BE A LIMIT FOR NUTRIENTS ON 
19:40:25 WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANTS IN THE NEAR FUTURE.

19:40:32 BECAUSE OF THAT AND BECAUSE OF OTHER REASONS, AGING INFRASTRUCTURE, 
19:40:38 FUNCTIONAL OBSOLESCENCE AND OTHER REASONS, BACK IN 2015, UNION SANITARY 
19:40:42 DISTRICT STARTED DOING EXTENSIVE CAPITAL PLANNING AND LOOKING AT OUR 
19:40:47 FACILITIES AND TRYING TO GET AN IDEA OF WHAT ARE OUR NEEDS NOW, WHAT ARE OUR 
19:40:50 NEEDS IN THE FUTURE, AND JUST OVER THE HORIZON.

19:40:57 IT WAS A YEAR-LONG EVIDENT THAT WAS A CULMINATION OF WHAT WE CALL THE 
19:41:04 ENHANCEMENT TREATMENT AND SITE UPGRADE PROJECT, IT'S A ROAD MAP FOR THE NEXT 
19:41:07 40 YEARS FOR THE DISTRICT'S INFRASTRUCTURE, AND IT'S A COMBINATION 
19:41:17 OF RI TROA FITTING, UPGRADING, EXISTING, RELOCATING EXISTING -- THIS 
19:41:21 IS TO ENSURE WE CAN CONTINUE TO PROVIDE THE HIGH LEVEL OF SERVICE TO ALL OF 
19:41:25 OUR CUSTOMERS, THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE GENERAL PLANS OF ALL THE 
19:41:31 CITIES THAT WE SERVE, AND WE DO NOT HAVE ANY ADVERSE EFFECTS, SEWER 
19:41:32 OVERFLOWS OR THINGS OF THAT NATURE.

19:41:44 THIS IS A GENERAL OUTLINE OF WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE.

19:41:47 THIS IS AN EXTENSIVE OVERALL OF OUR TREATMENT PLANT FACILITIES.

19:42:02 PHASE 1A IS AERATION BASINS, SOME PLANT EQUALIZATION AND STORAGE.

19:42:08 AS A PART OF THIS EVALUATION, WE HAVE STARTED LOOKING AT SOME EXISTING 
19:42:12 BUILDINGS THAT WE HAVE AT OUR TREATMENT PLANT SITE.

19:42:17 THE MAINTENANCE BUILDING, OPERATIONS BUILDING AND ADMINISTRATION ARE THREE 
19:42:23 SEPARATE BUILDINGS HERE ON SITE, AND PRIOR TO THE ETSU PROGRAM, WE STARTED 
19:42:26 EVALUATING THE NEEDS OF THE BUILDINGS AND WHETHER OR NOT THEY WERE MEETING 
19:42:32 CURRENT CODES, SOME OF THEM HAVE ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS, AND DUE TO 
19:42:37 THEIR AGE, THEY JUST WEREN'T WORKING ANY LONGER.

19:42:40 THEY CONDUCTED A SEPARATE ANALYSIS TO LOOK AT THE BUILDINGS AND THE 
19:42:44 CONCLUSION WAS IT WAS MORE COST-EFFECTIVE TO BUILD A NEW BUILDING 
19:42:47 THAN TO TRY TO RETROFIT EACH OF THE THREE BUILDINGS.

19:42:53 AS I MENTIONED, THIS EVALUATION WAS INDEPENDENT OF THE TREATMENT PLANT FOR 
19:42:58 THE ETSU PROGRAM, BUT WE'RE ABLE TO TAKE BOTH OF THE EVALUATIONS AND WE'VE 
19:43:02 INCORPORATED THEM INTO THE OVERALL ETSU PROGRAM, SO NOW THE MAINTENANCE 
19:43:05 FUNCTIONS, OPERATIONS AND ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTION WILL BE ALL 
19:43:06 HOUSED UNDER ONE ROOF MOVING FORWARD.

19:43:17 THIS IS A ARIST RENDITION OF WHAT THE CAMPUS BUILDING WILL LOOK LIKE.

19:43:21 IT WILL COMPLY WITH CURRENT CODES, IT IS GOING TO BE RESILIENT TO SEISMIC 
19:43:24 EVENTS AND SEA LEVEL RISE.

19:43:31 WE'RE INCLUDING SOLAR CHARGING AND LIKE I SAID, IT'S CONSOLIDATING THOSE THREE 
19:43:38 SEPARATE BUILDINGS UNDER ONE ROOF AND PROVIDE -- REDUCES OUR ENERGY 
19:43:40 CONSUMPTION AND ONGOING TREATMENT COSTS.

19:43:49 >> FOR OVER A CENTURY, UNION SANITARY DISTRICT HAS PROTECTED BOTH THE 
19:43:55 ENVIRONMENT AND -- TREATED WASTEWATER BACK TO THE ENVIRONMENT.

19:43:59 THIS MAY SOUND SIMPLE BUT IT REQUIRES CAREFULLY MANAGING A COMPLEX NETWORK 
19:44:03 OF PIPES, PUMPS AND LARGE SCALE MACHINERY,  TOTALING NEARLY $700 
19:44:04 MILLION IN ASSETS.

19:44:09 ALTHOUGH OUR INFRASTRUCTURE IS WELL MAINTAINED, PORTIONS OF THE ALVARADO 
19:44:12 TREATMENT PLANT IN UNION CITY DATE BACK TO THE 1960s.

19:44:17 TO MAINTAIN OUR HIGH LEVEL OF SERVICE, WE ARE EMBARKING ON A COMPREHENSIVE 
19:44:21 CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM THAT WILL SERVE AS OUR ROAD MAP FOR THE NEXT 40 
19:44:23 YEARS OF RELIABLE, COST-EFFECTIVE OPERATIONS.

19:44:30 THE ENHANCED TREATMENT AND SITE UPGRADE PROGRAM IS THE LARGEST AND MOST 
19:44:31 EXTENSIVE IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM IN OUR HISTORY.

19:44:37 >> OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS, THE PROGRAM WILL PROGRESS IN THREE PHASES 
19:44:41 AND WILL INCLUDE UPGRADES TO MANY PARTS OF THE ALVARADO PLANT TO RENEW AGING 
19:44:41 INFRASTRUCTURE.

19:44:47 IMPROVE WATER QUALITY IN THE BAY THROUGH ENHANCED WASTEWATER TREATMENT, 
19:44:49 AND INCREASE THE RESILIENCY OF OUR FACILITY.

19:44:53 WHEN WE TALK ABOUT TREATING WASTEWATER, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT REMOVING 
19:44:56 SUBSTANCES THROUGH A SERIES OF PHYSICAL, BIOLOGICAL, AND CHEMICAL 
19:44:56 PROCESSES.

19:45:01 THIS CAN INCLUDE REMOVING LARGE MATERIALS LIKE FLUSHABLE WIPES, ALL 
19:45:07 WAY DOWN TO MICROSCOPIC ORGANISMS AND NUTRIENTS LIKE NITROGEN.

19:45:11 NITROGEN IS A NATURALLY OCCURRING NUTRIENT THAT CAN CAUSAL GEE TO GROW 
19:45:15 FASTER THAN ECOSYSTEMS CAN HANDLE, IMPACTING WATER QUALITY AND DECREASING 
19:45:17 OXYGEN THAT FISH AND OTHER AQUATIC LIFE NEED TO SURVIVE.

19:45:24 HISTORICALLY, THE BAY HAS BEEN NATURALLY RESILIENT TO  
19:45:27 NUTRIENT-RELATED PROBLEMS BUT RECENT STUDIES INDICATE THIS RESILIENCE MAY 
19:45:28 BE DECLINING.

19:45:32 EVERY DAY, THE ALVARADO PLANT RECEIVES MORE THAN 10,000 POUNDS OF NITROGEN 
19:45:35 AND AMMONIA FROM OUR 356,000 SERVICE AREA POPULATION.

19:45:41 ONCE THE E TSU PROGRAM IS COMPLETE, WE'LL BE ABLE TO REDUCE NITROGEN BY 
19:45:47 50% AND AMMONIA BY 90% BEFORE RELEASING TREATED WATER INTO THE BAY.

19:45:49 PHASE 1A HAS TWO COMPONENTS.

19:45:54 THE FIRST CONSISTS OF MODIFICATIONS TO THE PLANT'S EXISTING AERATION BASINS 
19:45:55 AND THE ADDITION OF A NEW BASIN.

19:46:04 AERATION BASINS ARE LARGE TANKS THAT USE PO BLOWERS AND  DIFFUSERS TO 
19:46:05 ENHANCE THE BACTERIAL POPULATION.

19:46:07 ALSO KNOWN AS BUGS IN THE INDUSTRY.

19:46:14 THE BUGS USE THE OXYGEN TO THRIVE, AND ORGANIC MATERIALS AND WASTEWATER IS 
19:46:14 FOOD.

19:46:18 THE BASINS ACCELERATE THIS NATURAL PROCESS, BREAKING DOWN THOSE 
19:46:23 MATERIALS, AND ENABLING US TO TREAT VAST QUANTITIES OF WASTE RELIABLY, 
19:46:24 QUICKLY AND EFFICIENTLY.

19:46:30 THE SECOND COMPONENT OF PHASE 1A WILL INCLUDE CONSTRUCTING A NEW CAMPUS 
19:46:34 BUILDING WITHIN THE  PLANT, COMPRISED OF OPERATIONS, MAINTENANCE AND 
19:46:34 ADMINISTRATION.

19:46:41 IT WILL BE MORE RESILIENT TO SEA LEVEL RISE AND ENSURE SEISMIC CODE TO ENSURE 
19:46:44 OUR FACILITIES STAY OPEN 24/7.

19:46:48 PLACING THE BUILDING IN THIS POSITION OPTIMIZES THE LAYOUT OF THE TREATMENT 
19:46:52 PROCESS AND REDUCES THE AMOUNT OF ENERGY TO PUMP WASTE AND SOLIDS 
19:46:57 THROUGHOUT THE FACILITY DURING TREATMENT, LEADING TO LESS ENERGY 
19:46:58 USAGE AND LOWER COSTS.

19:47:03 IN PHASE 1B, WE'LL CONSTRUCT SECONDARY CLARIFIES, A PUMP STATION AND A 
19:47:04 DISINFECTION FACILITY.

19:47:08 EACH CLARIFIER IS THE SIZE OF A HALF A FOOTBALL FIELD AND 20 FEET DEEP.

19:47:13 THEY'RE USED DOWNSTREAM OF THE AERATION BASINS, AIDING THE TREATMENT PROCESS 
19:47:18 BY REMOVING ANY SOLIDS THAT CAN EITHER THROAT OR SETTLE OUT VIA  GRAVITY.

19:47:21 ALONG WITH THE CLARIFIERS, WE'RE ALSO CONSTRUCTING A NEW PUMP STATION THAT 
19:47:26 RETURNS THOSE HUNGRY BUGS BACK TO THE AIR RANGE OF MOTION BASINS, FURTHER 
19:47:31 ENLANSING THE REMOVAL OF NITROGEN AND PROTECTING OUR PROCESS.

19:47:36 THE NEW FACILITIES WORK IN TANDEM WITH THE PUMP STATION AND CLARIFIERS TO 
19:47:40 ENSURE WE CAN CONTINUE TO SAFELY DISCHARGE CLEAN WATER TO THE BAY.

19:47:47 PHASE 1C WILL CONVERT THE  EXISTING SECONDARY CLARIFIER TANKS TO AN 
19:47:52 EQUALIZATION BASIN THAT HOLDS THE WATER THAT FLOWS INTO THE PLANT AT VARYING 
19:47:59 RATES, THEND PUMP IT OUT AS A -- THIS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT DURING HEAVY RAIN 
19:48:03 FALL OR STORMS, WHEN THE FLOW COMING INTO THE PLANT CAN VARY.

19:48:07 EQUALIZED FLOW ALLOWS US TO USELESS POWER FOR TREATMENT AND MINIMIZE 
19:48:08 OPERATING COSTS.

19:48:14 >> IN YOU THINK THIS SOUNDS LIKE A HUGE JOB, YOU'RE RIGHT, BUT OUR HIGHLY 
19:48:18 SKILLED EMPLOYEES ARE CONSTANTLY WORKING TO CARRY OUT OUR MISSION WHILE 
19:48:21 PROVIDING OUR CUSTOMERS WITH THE LOWEST POSSIBLE RATES.

19:48:27 THE ETSU PROGRAM INCLUDES ONLY THE MOST CRITICAL PROJECTS NEEDED FOR OUR 
19:48:30 SYSTEM AND WE EXAMINED MANY OPTIONS TO ENSURE THE BEST VALUE.

19:48:34 THE PHASES OF THE PROGRAM OVER THE NEXT SEVEN TO 10 YEARS HAVE BEEN 
19:48:38 PRIORITIZED FOR MAXIMUM PERFORMANCE, EFFICIENCY AND COST CONTROL.

19:48:42 OUR LOCAL NATURAL HABITATS DEPEND ON HEALTHY WATERWAYS AND A THRIVING BAY.

19:48:48 THE ENVIRONMENT WE LIVE IN AND ENJOY EVERY DAY MEANS AS MUCH TO US AS IT 
19:48:52 DOES TO YOU, AND WE ARE PROUD TO HAVE A LEADERSHIP ROLE IN PROTECTING IT.

19:48:57 THE ETSU PROGRAM WILL MEAN WE CAN CONTINUE TO PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH, 
19:49:00 PROVIDE THE BEST POSSIBLE SERVICE TO THE  TRI-CITIES AND KEEP PROTECTING 
19:49:03 OUR PRECIOUS HOME FOR GENERATIONS TO COME.

19:49:06 TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THE ETSU PROGRAM, PLEASE VISIT OUR WEBSITE.

19:49:15 >> ALL RIGHT.

19:49:21 THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE THAT VIDEO WITH YOU.

19:49:24 WE DEVELOPED THAT VIDEO BECAUSE WE KEPT TALKING ABOUT THIS PROJECT AND WE KEPT 
19:49:29 REFERRING TO IT AS THE SCOPE AND SCALE AND WE KEPT SAYING IT'S REALLY BIG, 
19:49:31 AND PEOPLE WOULD SAY OKAY, WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

19:49:34 WE THOUGHT, WELL, IF WE PUT A QUICK VIDEO TOGETHER, IT WILL GIVE SOME 
19:49:37 SCOPE AND SCALE TO JUST HOW BIG THIS PROJECT IS.

19:49:44 IT'S CURRENTLY ESTIMATED TO COST ABOUT $509 MILLION, AND WE THINK THAT WILL 
19:49:48 BE SEVEN TO 10 YEARS OF CONTINUOUS CONSTRUCTION TO COMPLETE ALL OF THESE 
19:49:52 PHASES, AND WE'VE AWARDED THE CONSTRUCTION CONTRACT FOR THE AERATION 
19:49:57 BASIN MODIFICATION PHASE 1A BACK IN JANUARY OF THIS YEAR, AND WE'LL START 
19:49:59 CONSTRUCTION HERE VERY SHORTLY.

19:50:05 SOME ADDITIONAL BENEFITS FROM THIS PROGRAM IS, AGAIN, IT PROVIDES 
19:50:08 RELIABLE AND RESILIENT WET-WEATHER MANAGEMENT CAPABILITIES.

19:50:11 IT WILL MAKE US AN EARLY ADOPTER OF NUTRIENT REMOVAL.

19:50:18 AND WITH BETTER WATER QUALITY, IT WILL BE EASIER TO DO WATER RECLAMATION IN 
19:50:25 THE FUTURE, SO WE'RE SORT OF SEEING THIS AS A FIRST PHASE OF A WATER 
19:50:30 RECLAMATION IN THE FUTURE.

19:50:36 USD HAS CONTINUED TO PARTNER WITH ALAMEDA COUNTY WATER DISTRICT FOR MANY 
19:50:45 YEARS TO EVALUATE WATER REEU AND WE CONTINUE TO LOOK FOR SOURCES OF 
19:50:51 FUNDING FOR NOT ONLY THE ETSU PROJECT BUT THE RECLAIM PROJECT.

19:50:56 SO THAT IS MY SHORT  PRESENTATION, AGAIN, I SINCERELY APPRECIATE THE 
19:51:02 OPPORTUNITY TO ATTEND YOUR MEETING THIS EVENING AND GIVE YOU AN UPDATE ON WHAT 
19:51:05 USD IS UP TO AND WOULD BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS IF THE COUNCIL 
19:51:05 MAY HAVE ANY.

19:51:12 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU SO MUCH TO YOU, GENERAL MANAGER PAUL ELDRIDGE, AND IF 
19:51:17 I THINK -- LET ME SEE, I SEE COUNCILMEMBER  SHAO'S HAND IS RAISED.

19:51:24 FOR ANY QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME.

19:51:26 >> Councilmember Shao: THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR.

19:51:30 GENERAL MANAGER ELDRIDGE, THANK YOU FOR GIVING A WONDERFUL PRESENTATION.

19:51:40 PERSONALLY, I'VE BEEN TO YOUR FACILITY, TO MY RECOLLECTION, YOUR FACILITY IS 
19:51:43 JUST A ROAD AWAY FROM THE NEIGHBORING RESIDENTIAL AREA, AND I HAVE TO SAY, 
19:51:49 EVEN WHEN I WAS ON SITE, I COULD NOT SMELL ANYTHING, SO YOU HAVE BEEN DOING 
19:51:55 A WONDERFUL JOB IN ODOR CONTROL, WHICH COULD HAVE BEEN A PROBLEM IN OTHER 
19:51:57 AREAS OF THE BAY.

19:52:04 I'M NOT TRYING TO BELITTLE THEIR JOB, BUT I JUST HAVE TO GIVE YOU A 
19:52:04 COMPLIMENT.

19:52:12 SO MY QUESTION IS, WITH THE NEW ENHANCEMENT PROJECT, IS THERE ANY PART 
19:52:20 OF THAT PROJECT ADDRESSING THE OLDER ISSUE OR WOULD THAT CONTINUE TO HELP 
19:52:22 YOU HAVE GOOD CONTROL OF ODOR?

19:52:25 >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THOSE COMMENTS AND THE QUESTION.

19:52:28 AND IT A GOOD QUESTION.

19:52:34 IN ADDITION TO THE IMPROVEMENTS THAT THE VIDEO WENT OVER IN GREAT DETAIL, 
19:52:38 WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE WITH OR ENHANCE OUR ODOR CONTROL FACILITIES.

19:52:42 SOME OF THE CURRENT ODOR CONTROL FACILITIES ARE IN THE WAY OF THIS 
19:52:42 CONSTRUCTION.

19:52:44 THEY NEED TO BE RELOCATED.

19:52:49 WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY WHILE WE RELOCATE THEM TO UPGRADE THEM 
19:52:51 TO THE  NEWEST TECHNOLOGY.

19:52:56 THE TECHNOLOGY WE HAVE WORKS, IT'S BEEN WORKING WELL AS POINTED OUT.

19:52:57 WE APPRECIATE THOSE COMMENTS.

19:53:04 BUT AS WITH ANYTHING, THERE'S ALWAYS SOMETHING NEW AND PROVEN THAT WORKS A 
19:53:07 LITTLE BIT MORE  BETTER OR A LITTLE MORE COST-EFFECTIVE TO OPERATE, SO 
19:53:12 YES, THIS PROJECT WILL CONTINUE TO INCORPORATE THE ODOR CONTROL 
19:53:15 FACILITIES AND WHEN IT'S ALL SAID AND DONE, IT WILL PROBABLY BE A LITTLE 
19:53:19 BETTER THAN IT IS TODAY.

19:53:22 THE UNION SANITARY DISTRICT BOARD OF DIRECTORS TAKES BEING A GOOD NEIGHBOR 
19:53:25 VERY SERIOUSLY, AND I DON'T SEE THAT CHANGING ANY TIME SOON.

19:53:31 >> Councilmember Shao: THANK  YOU.

19:53:31 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:53:34 NEXT FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS, COUNCILMEMBER COX.

19:53:38 >> Councilmember Cox: THANK YOU.

19:53:43 THANK YOU SO MUCH, PAUL, FOR YOUR PRESENTATION AND ALSO TO OUR FELLOW 
19:53:50 TRUSTEES, WE REALLY APPRECIATE -- AND DIRECTORS AND YOUR WHOLE TEAM AND 
19:53:53 THEIR WORK REGARDING WASTEWATER MANAGEMENT.

19:54:00 I WAS JUST CURIOUS TO FIND OUT WITH YOUR PROJECT, WHICH IS AN ENORMOUS 
19:54:07 TASK, YOU'RE LOOKING AT OVER 500 -- ALMOST $510 MILLION.

19:54:11 WAS THIS SOMETHING THAT WAS  PASSED THROUGH A BOND MEASURE A COUPLE YEARS 
19:54:12 AGO?

19:54:14 I WAS JUST TRYING TO IDENTIFY THE SOURCE OF THE FUNDING.

19:54:16 >> SURE.

19:54:17 NO, GREAT QUESTION.

19:54:28 SO THE DISTRICT BACK IN EARLY 2020 EMBARKED UPON A RATE STUDY AND A RATE 
19:54:35 INCREASE, AND THAT RATE INCREASE WAS TO PAY FOR THESE IMPROVEMENTS AND THAT 
19:54:38 RATE INCREASE ENDED UP GETTING ADOPTED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS IN MID 2020.

19:54:46 THE DISTRICT UTILIZES A FAIRLY SOPHISTICATED FISCAL MODEL THAT TAKES 
19:54:51 ALL OF THESE COSTS INTO ACCOUNT AND IT GENERATES WHAT OUR FUTURE RATES NEED 
19:54:56 TO BE  BASED UPON OPERATIONS AND CAPITAL.

19:55:04 SINCE THE DISTRICT PASSED THOSE RATES, WE HAVE BEEN VERY FORTUNATE TO OBTAIN 
19:55:07 VERY LOW COST FINANCING.

19:55:15 SO FAR WE'VE BEEN THE RECIPIENT OF THE EPA LOAN WITH A VERY LOW INTEREST 
19:55:20 RATE, AND THAT PAYS FOR 49% OF ALL OF THE IMPROVEMENTS, SO WE'RE OUT STILL 
19:55:23 LOOKING FOR THE OTHER 51%.

19:55:30 WE ARE ALSO ABLE TO DO A BOND SALE LAST YEAR AND THE INTEREST RATE WE GOT ON 
19:55:38 THE BOND SALE, THAT WILL HELP PAY FOR A PORTION OF THE IMPROVEMENTS WAS MUCH 
19:55:42 BETTER THAN WHAT THE MODEL FORECASTED.

19:55:51 AN SRF LOAN, STATE REVOLVING FUND LOAN IS SET ASIDE FOR WASTEWATER PROJECTS.

19:55:54 SO THAT'S A REALLY LONG WAY OF ANSWERING YOUR QUESTION, I'M SORRY 
19:56:01 ABOUT THAT, BUT THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND STAFF TOOK ALL OF THE FINANCING 
19:56:06 INTO CONSIDERATION, AND THE CURRENT RATE SUPPORT ALL OF THESE IMPROVEMENTS 
19:56:09 THAT WE'RE PROPOSING AND STARTING.

19:56:13 >> Councilmember Cox: YES, AND I DO APPRECIATE YOU EXPLAINING THE 
19:56:18 DIFFERENT SOURCES OF FUNDING AND THE MIX BASICALLY WITH ALL OF THAT BECAUSE 
19:56:23 YOU ARE REGULATED BY THE EPA WITH A LOT OF THEIR TESTING AND ENVIRONMENTAL 
19:56:26 TESTING SERVICES-TYPE STANDARDS AND PROTOCOL.

19:56:34 I WANTED TO FIND OUT A LITTLE BIT MORE IN TERMS OF YOUR CONSTRUCTION, AND I 
19:56:39 SEE YOU HAD NOTED THAT THE CONTRACT WAS AWARDED BACK IN JANUARY WITH AERATION 
19:56:45 BASINS, MODIFICATIONS, AND I WAS JUST CURIOUS, ARE THEY A LOCAL COMPANY OR 
19:56:52 ARE THEY A COMPANY THAT -- I MEAN, OBVIOUSLY THIS HAS GOT TO BE THERE 
19:56:54 SPECIALLY, BUT CAN YOU SHARE A LITTLE MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THIS COMPANY 
19:56:59 AND MAYBE IF THERE'S SOME SIMILARCATIONS, MUNICIPALITIES THAT 
19:57:02 COULD BE KIND OF SIMILAR TO WHAT WE HAVE AND JUST KIND OF SHARE A LITTLE 
19:57:02 BIT ABOUT THEM?

19:57:03 >> SURE.

19:57:04 NO, GREAT QUESTION.

19:57:11 THE CONTRACTOR THAT GOT THE LOW BID, AND WE OPERATE UNDER THE PUBLIC 
19:57:15 CONTRACT, SO WE HAVE TO ACCEPT THE LOWEST BID FROM A RESPONSIVE BIDDER.

19:57:20 THE LOW BID THAT WE RECEIVED FOR THIS PROJECT WAS FROM A COMPANY CALLED WM 
19:57:20 LYLES.

19:57:27 THE DISTRICT HAS NEVER WORKED WITH THEM, HOWEVER, THEY ARE HEADQUARTERED 
19:57:28 OUT OF  BAKERSFIELD.

19:57:29 THEY'RE A VERY LARGE CONTRACTOR.

19:57:33 YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT, THEY SPECIALIZE IN THIS TYPE OF WORK.

19:57:38 NOT EVERY CONTRACTOR CAN DO THIS TYPE OF WORK, ESPECIALLY AT THIS SCOPE AND 
19:57:38 SCALE.

19:57:45 THEIR CONTRACT ALONE FOR THE AERATION BASINS IS ABOUT $120 MILLION, TO GIVE 
19:57:47 YOU AN IDEA OF HOW MUCH WORK THEY HAVE TO DO.

19:57:51 THEY DO HAVE A NORTHERN CALIFORNIA PRESENCE BUT THEIR PRIMARY 
19:57:55 HEADQUARTERS IS IN BAKERSFIELD, AND THEN THEY HAVE OTHER COMPANIES THAT 
19:57:57 THEY PARTNER WITH THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY.

19:58:03 WE DID AN EXTENSIVE REFERENCE CHECK ON ALL THE WORK THAT THEY'VE DONE FOR 
19:58:09 OTHER MUNICIPALITIES, AND THEY JUST GOT ACCOLADES FROM EVERYONE WE TALK TO, 
19:58:14 EVEN SOME OF THEIR COMPETITORS SAID THAT THEY'RE A GREAT CONTRACTOR AND IF 
19:58:16 YOU HAVE THE CHANCE TO WORK WITH THEM, YOU SHOULD TAKE IT.

19:58:19 SO WE JUST STARTED OUR RELATIONSHIP.

19:58:21 SO FAR, SO GOOD.

19:58:22 IT'S A VERY LONG CONTRACT.

19:58:27 IT'S GOING TO TAKE US THREE YEARS TO FINISH PHASE 1A, AND WE'RE HOPING THAT 
19:58:31 WE FEEL THE SAME WAY ABOUT THEM IN THREE YEARS AS WE DO NOW.

19:58:36 AND -- [INAUDIBLE]

19:58:37 >> Councilmember Cox: YES, ABSOLUTELY.

19:58:43 IS THERE SOME SMALL BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT INVOLVED WITH THIS TO 
19:58:49 ENGAGE IN SOME OF THE UNIQUE SMALL BUSINESSES OR, YOU KNOW, WOMEN-OWN 
19:58:53 BUSINESSES,  VETERAN-OWNED BUSINESSES AND ALSO IF YOU COULD SPEAK TO THAT, 
19:58:57 AND ALSO IF THERE'S ANY UNION INVOLVED IN THIS LOCAL WORK.

19:58:57 >> SURE.

19:59:08 THE PUBLIC CONTRACT CODE REQUIRES CERTAIN PERCENTAGES OF MINORITY OR 
19:59:11 WOMEN-OWNED BUSINESSES TO PARTICIPATE OR HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE 
19:59:15 IN BEING EITHER A SUBCONTRACTOR OR A SUPPLIER.

19:59:21 I APOLOGIZE, OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD, I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT OR HOW MANY OF 
19:59:28 THEIR SUPPLIERS AS REQUIREMENTS, BUT THEY DO HAVE TO GO OUT AND TRY TO GET 
19:59:32 FIRST RIGHT OF REFUSAL FOR FOLKS WHO MEET THAT REQUIREMENT.

19:59:36 I JUST DON'T KNOW OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD EXACTLY WHAT THAT PERCENTAGE IS, 
19:59:37 BUT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE'RE REQUIRED TO DO.

19:59:44 I DO KNOW THAT THEY'RE USING AS MANY LOCAL SUPPLIERS AS THEY POSSIBLY CAN, 
19:59:47 WHETHER IT'S CONCRETE OR STEEL OR ANY OTHER MATERIALS.

19:59:52 IT JUST MAKES GOOD BUSINESS SENSE FOR THEM SO THEY'RE TRYING TO UTILIZE 
19:59:55 LOCAL RESOURCES AS BEST THEY CAN.

19:59:56 >> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.

20:00:02 I WOULD LOVE TO SEE HOW THEY CAN ENGAGE OUR LOCAL COMMUNITY SUPPLIERS AND EVEN 
20:00:08 THE FREMONT CHAMBER AND ALL THE SMALL BUSINESSES TO BE ABLE TO BE PART OF A 
20:00:12 LOCAL DEVELOPMENT IMPACT RIGHT HERE.

20:00:17 I DIDN'T HEAR ABOUT THE LABOR.

20:00:21 ARE YOU INVOLVED WITH THE UNIONS AND TRADE GROUPS IN THIS TYPE WORK AND 
20:00:22 SHARE A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THAT.

20:00:26 >> SURE, SORRY, MY APOLOGIES.

20:00:30 SO THIS PROJECT DOES NOT REQUIRE 100% UNION LABOR.

20:00:36 WE ARE REQUIRED TO PAY UNION RATE OR WHAT WE CALL PREVAILING WAGES.

20:00:39 SO ABSOLUTELY, WE'RE PAYING PREVAILING WAGE.

20:00:44 WHETHER OR NOT I DON'T KNOW OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD IF LIELS IS A UNION SHOP, 
20:00:52 BUT THERE'S NOTHING IN ANY OF THE PROJECTS OR CONTRACT SPECS THAT WOULD 
20:00:58 PREINCLUDE UNION LABOR BUT ABSOLUTELY WE'RE REQUIRED TO PAY UNION WAGES.

20:00:58 >> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.

20:01:03 COULD YOU FOLLOW UP IN A LITTLE MORE DETAIL JUST TO MAKE SURE ON THE 
20:01:06 WOMEN-OWNED BUSINESS?

20:01:09 JUST CURIOUS AND SEE IF YOU COULD PROVIDE FOLLOW-UP INFORMATION ON THAT 
20:01:14 AND ANYTHING ELSE RELATING TO LABOR TRADE GROUPS AND WHICH ONES MAY BE 
20:01:15 ENGAGED, THAT WOULD BE GREAT.

20:01:15 >> SURE.

20:01:23 IF IT'S OKAY WITH THE COUNCIL, I'LL GO AHEAD AND FORWARD THAT INFORMATION VIA 
20:01:26 THE CITY MANAGER ONCE I GET IT, IF THAT'S ACCEPTABLE?

20:01:27 >> Councilmember Cox: THAT WOULD BE PERFECT.

20:01:30 I WAS GOING TO GET READY TO SAY THAT AS WELL.

20:01:32 THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR PROVIDING SOME UPDATES.

20:01:33 THANK YOU.

20:01:33 >> MY PLEASURE.

20:01:34 THANK YOU.

20:01:40 >> Mayor Mei: NEXT, I SEE COUNCILMEMBER KENG WITH YOUR HAND RAISED.

20:01:41 >> YES, MADAME MAYOR.

20:01:50 ACTUALLY I WAS GOING TO ACTUALLY ASK ONE OF THE SAME QUESTIONS, HOW THIS -- 
20:01:55 BUT I DO WANT TO SHARE MY APPRECIATION OF ALL YOUR STAFF AND ALL THE BOARD 
20:02:03 MEMBERS OF YOUR HARD WORK COMPLETING THE PLANNING OF THIS PROJECT AND THIS 
20:02:10 VERY IMPORTANT WORK, MAKING SURE THAT OUR WASTEWATER IS TREATED WELL AND 
20:02:14 THAT OUR BAY IS NOT POLLUTED, SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR WORK.

20:02:14 >> THANK YOU.

20:02:16 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

20:02:18 NEXT I'LL OPEN UP FOR PUBLIC COMMENT.

20:02:23 I SEE WITH HAVE A COUPLE SPEAKERS ON THIS ITEM.

20:02:24 FIRST IS KELLY ABREU.

20:02:26 WELCOME, KELLY.

20:02:35 >> YEAH, THE COMPLEXITY OF THESE LARGE CHEMICAL PROCESS PLANTS IS QUITE 
20:02:36 SOMETHING.

20:02:46 AND MOST PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE JUST HOW -- ALL THE DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGIES AND 
20:02:46 HOW COMPLICATED IT IS.

20:02:53 NOW AS WAS JUST MENTIONED, I WAS SPECULATING ABOUT THIS BUT THE SPEAKER 
20:02:54 WENT RIGHT OUT AND SAID IT.

20:03:01 THIS IS THE FIRST STEP TOWARDS POTABLE WATER RE-USE.

20:03:05 POTABLE WATER RE-USE IS A HIGHLY POLITICAL ISSUE.

20:03:06 HIGHLY CONTROVERSIAL.

20:03:10 PEOPLE GO NUTS WHEN YOU START TALKING ABOUT THAT.

20:03:18 AND IF YOU'RE GOING TO GET INTO THAT, THE ISSUE IS NOT REALLY TECHNOLOGICAL, 
20:03:20 BECAUSE TECHNOLOGIES ARE OUT THERE.

20:03:26 IT'S THE POLITICAL COOPERATION THAT'S REQUIRED BETWEEN THE  CITIES, THE 
20:03:32 WATER AGENCIES, THE WASTEWATER AGENCY, AND THE PUBLIC.

20:03:37 BASICALLY THE ONLY THING THAT'S GOING TO GET THE PUBLIC TO GO ALONG IS THEY 
20:03:42 HAVE TO SENSE THAT THERE'S SOME KIND OF A DESPERATE NEED FOR THE WATER.

20:03:49 AND THEY'RE WILLING TOLL GO ALONG WITH THIS FOR VARIOUS REASONS, USUALLY 
20:03:56 THEY'RE GETTING THEIR ARMS TWISTED BY DROUGHTS OR WHATEVER, SOME KIND OF 
20:03:57 REAL NEED.

20:04:04 AND AS AN EXAMPLE OF JUST HOW DIFFICULT THIS IS, POLITICALLY, LOOK OVER HERE 
20:04:05 AT PLEASANTON.

20:04:12 PLEASANTON HAS OPENLY OPPOSED POTABLE RE-USE THROUGH A POLITICAL REAL VOLT.

20:04:15  REVOLT.

20:04:21 THEY PULLED OUT OF REGIONAL PLANNING FOR A POTABLE RE-USE PROJECT.

20:04:25 THIS COULD HAPPEN ELSEWHERE IF IT'S NOT HANDLED CORRECTLY.

20:04:28 THERE'S JUST A LACK OF COORDINATION OVER THERE.

20:04:33 OVER HERE IN THE FREMONT AREA, UNION CITY AND SO ON, THESE DIFFERENT 
20:04:36 AGENCIES SEEM TO BE WORKING TOGETHER A LOT BETTER.

20:04:36 THANK YOU.

20:04:40 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

20:04:50 NEXT SPEAKER IS FP ARJUN KHANNA.

20:04:51 WELCOME.

20:04:53 >> I'M SORRY, I HAD MY HAND UP EARLIER.

20:04:54 >> Mayor Mei: OKAY.

20:04:55 THANK YOU.

20:05:01 THE NEXT SPEAKER IS KATHERINE.

20:05:02 WELCOME.

20:05:03 >> HI.

20:05:06 I HOPE I DON'T SOUND IGNORANT BY ASKING THIS QUESTION.

20:05:15 THIS IS THE FIRST TIME -- SORRY ABOUT THAT.

20:05:21 THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME I'VE EVER HEARD ANYTHING ABOUT THIS, AND I WANT TO 
20:05:27 THANK THE  PRESENTER FOR MAKING THIS VERY, VERY EASY TO UNDERSTAND, BUT I 
20:05:33 WAS KIND OF CURIOUS AS TO WHY THE WATER IS BEING RETURNED TO THE BAY AND 
20:05:40 WHETHER OR NOT WATER IS ACTUALLY BEING RETURNED TO CONSUMER USE AS WELL.

20:05:46 SO THAT WAS JUST KIND OF A CURIOSITY FOR MYSELF.

20:05:46 THAT'S IT.

20:05:47 THANK YOU.

20:05:51 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

20:05:56 AND I BELIEVE THAT WAS THE LAST PUBLIC COMMENT, SO I'M GOING TO CLOSE THE 
20:06:00 PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD AND I'LL RETURN TO THE COUNCIL FOR DISCUSSIONS.

20:06:07 AND SEE IF MY COUNCIL HAS ANY COMMENTS.

20:06:10 IF NOT, I WANTED TO SAY THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION THIS EVENING, AND I 
20:06:16 BELIEVE IT WAS -- I'M TRYING TO REMEMBER, IT WAS PREPANDEMIC, ONE OF 
20:06:20 YOUR LAST ANNIVERSARIES, I THINK SEVERAL OF US HAD A CHANCE TO TOUR 
20:06:23 YOUR FACILITY AND WE APPRECIATE THE PARTNERSHIP TO WORK WITH YOUR BOARD 
20:06:29 AND THE MEMBERS TO KEEP INFORMED AND THAT'S WHY WE ARE VERY FORTUNATE WITH 
20:06:32 THIS OPPORTUNITY WITH THE BUILD BACK BETTER AND THE INFRASTRUCTURE FUNDING, 
20:06:37 PERHAPS THERE'S A GOOD OPPORTUNITY, ESPECIALLY SINCE OUR CITY AND WE'LL BE 
20:06:40 TALKING ABOUT THAT IN TERMS OF AS WE MOVE FORWARD ON OUR LEGISLATIVE 
20:06:46 PRIORITIES AND PRINCIPLES IN TERMS OF OBJECTIVES AND GOALS, THAT WE CAN FIND 
20:06:51 WAYS, PERHAPS, TO BE ABLE TO MATCH BETTER IN TERMS OF THOSE TYPES OF 
20:06:56 DETERMINATIONS OR SUPPORTIVE IN JOINT EFFORTS.

20:07:00 I SEE COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN ALSO WITH THEIR HAND RAISED ON THIS TOPIC.

20:07:02 >> Councilmember Kassan: YES, I'M SORRY, IT WAS JUST KIND OF ABRUPT.

20:07:07 I WAS WONDERING IF MAYBE WE COULD GET SOME QUICK ANSWERS TO SOME OF THE 
20:07:11 QUESTIONS THAT WERE ASKED BY THE PUBLIC, IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND.

20:07:18 >> I WOULD NOT MIND AT ALL IF IT'S OKAY WITH THE CHAIR AND THE REST OF THE 
20:07:20 COUNCIL, I'D BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO.

20:07:20 >> Mayor Mei: SURE.

20:07:22 WOULD YOU LIKE TO SHARE?

20:07:25 >> Councilmember Kassan: I HOPE YOU MADE A NOTE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT CAME 
20:07:25 UP.

20:07:28 >> I THINK SO.

20:07:29 >> Councilmember Kassan: THANK YOU.

20:07:30 >> YES.

20:07:37 SO TO THE FIRST QUESTION OR COMMENT THAT WAS MADE ABOUT RECLAIMED WATER, I 
20:07:43 COULDN'T AGREE WITH THE FIRST SPEAKER ANYMORE.

20:07:49 THESE PROJECTS, THEY ARE A TECHNOLOGY PROJECT, BUT IT'S NOT CUTTING EDGE, 
20:07:55 THE TECHNOLOGY -- THEY REALLY ARE A FINANCING PROJECT AND A PUBLIC REACH 
20:07:59 PROJECT, AND IF YOU DON'T DO EITHER ONE OF THOSE PIECES WELL, THEN THEY WILL 
20:08:01 BE A FAILURE.

20:08:05 I WOULD PUT EMPHASIS ON THE PUBLIC OUTREACH COMPONENT.

20:08:10 ALTHOUGH OUR PRESENTATION MENTIONED AND THESE IMPROVEMENTS STATED THAT THIS IS 
20:08:16 THE FIRST PHASE OF A RECLAIMED WATER PROJECT, BY NO MEANS ARE WE READY TO 
20:08:22 DO ANYTHING THAT WOULD RESEMBLE WATER LEK LAMATION.

20:08:24 A WHOLE 'NOTHER LEVEL OF TREATMENT PROCESSES WOULD BE REQUIRED.

20:08:31 BEFORE WE GET TO THAT POINT, WE'VE DONE EXTENSIVE OUTREACH WITH ALL OF OUR 
20:08:40 PARTNERS AND ALL OF OUR STAKEHOLDERS, THE SANITARY -- WOULD WORK IN 
20:08:43 PARTNERSHIP WITH THE CITY OR OTHER ORGANIZATIONS AS FAR AS THOSE WHO ARE 
20:08:50 INTERESTED IN THE HEALTH OF THE CREEKS AND THE PARK DISTRICT, SO ON, BECAUSE 
20:08:56 AT THE END OF THE DAY, THESE ARE VERY EXPENSIVE PROJECTS, AND ALL OF THE 
20:09:00 CUSTOMERS WILL NEED TO BE BEHIND THE CONCEPT AND BE WILLING TO PAY FOR IT.

20:09:04 IF THEY'RE NOT BEHIND THE CONCEPT, THEY'RE PROBABLY NOT WILLING TO PAY 
20:09:09 FOR IT, AND, THEREFORE, THE PROJECT DIES A MISERABLE DEATH AND NO ONE EVER 
20:09:14 WANTS TO SPEAK OF IT AGAIN, WHICH IS A SHAME BECAUSE IT IS A RESOURCE THAT 
20:09:15 COULD HAVE A SECOND LIFE.

20:09:20 AND THAT'S SORT OF A SEGUE TO THE SECOND SPEAKER'S OPTION, WHICH IS WHY 
20:09:25 AREN'T WE UTILIZING THIS RESOURCE MORE AND WE'RE PUTTING WATER OUT IN THE 
20:09:32 BAY, AND I THINK THAT MORE OR LESS, IT'S INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE, THERE'S 
20:09:35 ADDITIONAL TREATMENT PROCESSES INVOLVED.

20:09:44 ORDER OF MAGNITUDE, TWO TO $300 MILLION OVER AND ABOVE THE $509 MILLION WE'RE 
20:09:44 ALREADY PLANNING TO SPEND.

20:09:47 WHICH IS GOING TO HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE RATES.

20:09:53 THERE ARE BENEFITS TO WATER RECLAMATION AND RE-USE.

20:09:57 IT'S A DROUGHT-PROOF SUPPLY BUT IT'S AN EXPENSIVE SUPPLY.

20:10:02 SO ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE IN THE CONCEPT, WE THINK THERE'S A FUTURE FOR REA 
20:10:06 CLAIMED WATER AT SOME POINT IN THE FUTURE, THERE'S A LOT OF WORK THAT 
20:10:11 NEEDS TO BE DONE BEFORE WE EVER GET THERE, BUT IT'S ON OUR RADAR, IT 
20:10:15 SOMETHING THAT'S IMPORTANT AND HAS BEEN IMPORTANT TO ALL OF OUR COLLECTIVE 
20:10:21 AGENCIES, AND WHEN THE TIME COMES, THERE WILL BE SUCH EXTENSIVE OUTREACH 
20:10:25 THAT AT SOME POINT, ALL OF YOU WILL PROBABLY BE INCREDIBLY TIRED OF 
20:10:26 HEARING FROM US.

20:10:31 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

20:10:37 AGAIN, WE APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTNER WITH OUR GOOD NEIGHBORS AND TO 
20:10:42 HAVE JOINT COLLABORATIVE EFFORTS, ESPECIALLY ON THIS OPPORTUNITY OF 
20:10:43 MOVING FORWARD ON INFRASTRUCTURE.

20:10:44 >> THANK YOU.

20:10:45 >> Mayor Mei: HAVE A GOOD EVENING.

20:10:49 PLEASE SHARE OUR BEST WISHES TO YOUR STAFF, YOUR TEAM AND YOUR BOARD.

20:10:50 >> I WILL.

20:10:51 THANK YOU, MAYOR.

20:10:52 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

20:11:02 NEXT ON THE AGENDA THIS EVENING IS ITEM 7C, ADOPTION OF THE 2022 LEGISLATIVE 
20:11:03 GUIDING PRINCIPLES AND PRIORITIES.

20:11:10 I BELIEVE WE HAVE JOINING US THIS EVENING OUR MANAGEMENT ANALYST, AMANDA 
20:11:17 GALLO, WHO HAS A PRESENTATION AVAILABLE IF IS SO DESIRED TO GO THROUGH THE 
20:11:18 PRESENTATION.

20:11:22 COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, YOU HAD HOPED TO FOCUS ON THIS, SO WE HAVE A 
20:11:27 PRESENTATION AVAILABLE, SHOULD IT BE SOMETHING THAT YOU'D LIKE TO SEE.

20:11:33 >> Councilmember Kassan: YOU KNOW, I'M SURPRISED THAT THAT WOULD BE YOUR 
20:11:34 APPROACH TO THIS.

20:11:39 IT DOES SEEM TO ME TO BE IMPORTANT THAT -- IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT STATEMENT OF 
20:11:42 OUR POLICIES AS A CITY.

20:11:46 IT DOES SURPRISE ME THAT PEOPLE WOULDN'T WANT TO DISCUSS IT.

20:11:50 IF YOU DON'T WANT -- IF NO ONE ELSE WANTS TO HEAR THE PRESENTATION, I DID 
20:11:54 READ THE DOCUMENT SO I'M HAPPY TO -- I COULD EITHER SHARE -- I COULD ASK 
20:11:58 QUESTIONS, I COULD SHARE MY CONCERNS, OR IF NO ONE ELSE WANTS TO DISCUSS IT, 
20:12:01 I CAN JUST SAY --

20:12:04 >> Mayor Mei: THE PRESENTATION IS NOT VERY LONG, SO I THINK, AMANDA, WOULD 
20:12:04 YOU LIKE TO SHARE WITH US?

20:12:06 I THINK IT'S GOOD FOR PEOPLE TO SEE.

20:12:10 WE DO UPDATE IT EVERY YEAR AND WE DO ASK FOR PUBLIC COMMENT, AND I'M 
20:12:15  TRYING TO SEE IF WE HAVE ANY --

20:12:20 >> HI, MAYOR MEI AND MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL.

20:12:21 GREAT TO SEE YOU.

20:12:25 I FIRST WOULD LIKE TO TURN IT OVER TO GENEVA BOSQUES, DIRECTOR OF 
20:12:27 COMMUNICATIONS AND LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS.

20:12:32 I'D LIKE FOR HER TO SHARE A LITTLE INTRO AS SHE IS ALSO LEADING THIS 
20:12:32 EFFORT.

20:12:32 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

20:12:35 WELCOME, GENEVA.

20:12:37 >> GOOD EVENING.

20:12:41 AMANDA AND I ARE BOTH REALLY HAPPY TO BE HERE THIS EVENING TO PRESENT THE 
20:12:45 CITY'S 2022 LEGISLATIVE GUIDING PRINCIPLES AND PRIORITIES WITH ALL OF 
20:12:46 YOU TONIGHT.

20:12:53 AND WE'RE MORE THAN HAPPY TO SHARE OUR SHORT PRESENTATION AND WE'RE HAPPY TO 
20:12:59 TRY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE AND PROVIDE ANY OPTIONS IF THAT'S 
20:13:01 WHAT COUNCIL IS SEEKING THIS EVENING.

20:13:06 SO JUST TO KIND OF FRAME THE CONVERSATION, WE HAVE SPENT A LOT OF 
20:13:08 TIME OVER THE LAST NINE MONTHS REALLY SINCE THE MIDDLE OF LAST YEAR TRYING 
20:13:10 TO EVALUATE OUR PROGRAM.

20:13:15 WE'VE DONE VISITS WITH OTHER CITIES, WE'VE MET WITH LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA 
20:13:21 CITIES AND OF COURSE OUR OWN LOBBYISTS TO RESEARCH BEST PRACTICES AND REALLY 
20:13:26 EVALUATE A REVAMP OF OUR CURRENT POLICY DOCUMENT, WORKING CLOSELY WITH OUR 
20:13:33 DEPARTMENT HEADS AS SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS, AND REALLY TO ENSURE WHICH I 
20:13:36 THINK IS REALLY THE FOCUS ON WHAT YOU'LL SEE DIFFERENT THIS YEAR, IS 
20:13:41 THAT, YOU KNOW, WE'VE TRIED TO ALIGN OUR LEGISLATIVE PLATFORM WITH THE 
20:13:46  COUNCIL-ADOPTED STRATEGIC PLANS AND PRIORITIES, SO WHEN YOU TAKE A LOOK AT 
20:13:52 OUR DOCUMENT, YOU'LL NOTICE THAT THE OVERVIEW AND THE GUIDING PRINCIPLES 
20:13:56 THAT ARE ON THE FIRST COUPLE OF PAGES, THAT'S REALLY WHERE THE CHANGE IS IN 
20:13:58 THE DOCUMENT ARE THIS  YEAR.

20:14:06 WE'VE REALLY TRY TO OUTLINE COUNCIL'S PRIORITIES THAT ARE ADOPTED TONIGHT AS 
20:14:11 WELL AS OUR GUIDING PRINCIPLES IN THE GENERAL PLAN, MOBILITY PLAN, WE'VE 
20:14:15 EVEN INCLUDED OUR FREMONT COMPASSIONATE CITY CHARTER, AND SO WE'RE REALLY 
20:14:22 TRYING TO ALIGN OUR LEGISLATIVE WORK UNDER THESE ADOPTED PRIORITIES THAT 
20:14:22 THE CITY HAS.

20:14:29 AND I ALSO WANT TO NOTE THAT THE SECOND HALF OF THE DOCUMENT, THE LEGISLATIVE 
20:14:34 PRIORITIES FOR 2022, THEY REALLY REMAIN CONSISTENT WITH OUR PRIORITIES THAT 
20:14:35 WERE ADOPTED LAST YEAR.

20:14:38 WE DID DO A CLEAN-UP, WE REMOVED SOME.

20:14:43 THERE WERE ONE OR TWO THAT WERE ADDED, BUT FOR THE MOST PART, THOSE ARE VERY 
20:14:47 CONSISTENT WITH THE SAME PRIORITIES THAT WERE ADOPTED LAST YEAR BY COUNCIL.

20:14:51 SO YOU SHOULDN'T SEE TOO MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE OTHER THAN SOME CLEAN-UP IN 
20:14:51 THAT AREA.

20:14:57 SO WITHOUT SAYING ANYTHING ELSE, I'M GOING TO TURN IT OVER TO AMANDA TO 
20:15:00 SHARE OUR SLIDE PRESENTATION AND THEN WE'LL COME BACK TO ANY QUESTIONS THAT 
20:15:01 YOU HAVE.

20:15:05 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

20:15:11 >> I'M GOING TO SHARE MY SCREEN.

20:15:21 OKAY, I THINK MY SCREEN IS SHARING.

20:15:24 ONCE AGAIN, THANK YOU ALL FOR HAVING US HERE TONIGHT TO PRESENT OUR 
20:15:27 LEGISLATIVE PRINCIPLES AND PRIORITIES.

20:15:33 AS GENEVA MENTIONED, WITH HER ADDITION AND GREAT WORK TO THE PROGRAM, WE'VE 
20:15:37 BEEN ABLE TO REALLY EXPAND OUR EFFORTS OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS AND THIS  
20:15:42 YEAR, EVEN MORE SO, LOOKING AT RESEARCH OF BEST PRACTICES FROM OTHER CITIES, 
20:15:46 OTHER LEGISLATIVE ORGANIZATIONS THAT THE CITY PARTNERS WITH, AND WORKING 
20:15:51 CLOSELY WITH OUR REPRESENTATIVES AND OUR FEDERAL AND STATE LEGISLATIVE 
20:15:52 ADVOCATES.

20:15:55 SO THIS PRESENTATION JUST IS GOING TO BE A QUICK OVERVIEW OF THE DOCUMENT 
20:15:57 THAT YOU HAVE IN FRONT OF YOU.

20:16:08 SO THIS SLIDE DISPLAYS KIND OF HOUR OUR LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM IS OPERATED IN FREMONT.

20:16:13 IT IS MANAGED IN THE CITY MANAGER'S OFFICE, WHERE WE DO HAVE REGULAR 
20:16:17 COMMUNICATIONS WITH OUR LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATES AND OUR OTHER ORGANIZATIONS 
20:16:21 AT THE STATE AND FEDERAL LEVELS LIKE GENEVA MENTIONED, LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA 
20:16:26 CITIES IS A PROMINENT ORGANIZATION THAT WE CONSULT WITH.

20:16:32 WE ALSO TURN TO OUR CITY DEPARTMENTS AS SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS TO REALLY 
20:16:40 REVIEW LEGISLATION FURTHER AND ALSO AGAIN SOME OF OUR POLICIES THAT ARE 
20:16:41 ALREADY IMPLEMENTED HERE IN FREMONT.

20:16:48 OVER THE LEGISLATIVE CYCLES, WE DO REVIEW AND TRACK LEGISLATION BASED ON 
20:16:51 SOME OF THE CITY PRIORITIES THAT ARE ADOPTED BY THE DOCUMENT AS WELL AS 
20:16:56 VARIOUS PROJECTS, AND OF COURSE THE CITY COUNCIL PRIORITIES THAT ARE 
20:16:58 ADOPTED IN THE BEGINNING OF THE CALENDAR YEAR.

20:17:05 AND THEN WITH THIS REVIEW AND ANALYSIS, WE DO SUBMIT POSITION LETTERS, WHICH 
20:17:12 ARE SIGNED BY THE MAYOR AS THE CITY'S DESIGNEE.

20:17:16 ANY THAT DOESN'T FIT OUR PRIORITIES OR IS NOT MENTIONED IN THE SUBJECT MATTER 
20:17:21 AREA WILL BE BROUGHT BACK TO THE COUNCIL FOR A REVIEW AND VOTE FOR AN 
20:17:22 ADOPTION.

20:17:29 AS GENEVA MENTIONED, THESE ARE SOME OF THE ALREADY ADOPTED STRATEGIC PLANS 
20:17:35 AND POLICIES THAT THE COUNCIL HAS TAKEN ACTION ON, DEVELOPED BY OUR 
20:17:43 DEPARTMENTS THROUGHOUT THE YEAR, REALLY SERVING AS A GUIDING DOCUMENT AND 
20:17:47 STRATEGIC WAY THAT A LOT OF OUR PRINCIPLES AND PROVIDE ORTS HAVE BEEN 
20:17:53  PRIORITIES HAVE BEEN WRITTEN BASED ON OUR POLICIES.

20:17:59 SO THE ACTUAL LEGISLATIVE PRIORITY DOCUMENTS SPAN OVER MOST OF OUR 
20:18:00 CITY-WIDE  DEPARTMENTS.

20:18:09 ALSO THE PRIORITIES IN THE DOCUMENT ARE SEPARATED INTO EIGHT CATEGORY AREAS.

20:18:16 THESE ARE ALIGNED CLOSELY WITH THE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES' POLICY 
20:18:23 AREAS AS WELL, BUT THE DIVERSITY, EQUITY AND INCLUSION SECTION WAS 
20:18:27 SPECIFICALLY ADDED HERE IN FREMONT DUE TO SOME OF THE ACTION THAT WE TOOK 
20:18:33 LAST YEAR, FOR EXAMPLE, THE AFGHAN REFUGEE, THE CITY OF FREMONT WAS A 
20:18:37 LEADER IN REALLY ADVOCATING TO SOME OF THAT WORK SO WE WANTED TO BE ABLE TO 
20:18:42 INCLUDE IT AND EXPAND TO ALL COMMUNITIES SHOULD THESE LEGISLATIVE 
20:18:42 PRIORITIES COME UP AGAIN.

20:18:54 IN 2021, THE CITY TOOK A STANCE ON 12 INDIVIDUAL BILLS OR INITIATIVES AT THE 
20:19:00 FEDERAL AND STATE LEVEL, PRIMARILY AT THE STATE LEVEL, WHERE WE TOOK 
20:19:05 DIFFERENT POSITIONS OF SUPPORT, WE WORKED WITH OUR LEGISLATURE TO AMEND 
20:19:09 CERTAIN BILLS, WE OPPOSED CERTAIN BILLS, AND IT'S REALLY A WAY THAT AS A 
20:19:15 CITY, WE CAN SHOW OUR ADVOCACY IN PARTICULAR AREAS OR FIELDS THAT ARE 
20:19:19 IMPORTANT AND MEET OUR PRIORITIES OR DO NOT.

20:19:25 IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THIS YEAR, AT THE STATE LEGISLATURE, THE DEADLINE 
20:19:30 FOR BILLS TO BE SUBMITTED HAS PASSED, AND SO WE'RE REALLY HOPING TONIGHT 
20:19:36 TOLL REALLY GET OUR PRIORITY DOCUMENT ADOPTED SO WE CAN CONTINUE TO MAKE 
20:19:40 FREMONT A LEADER IN TAKING THESE ADVOCACY POSITIONS AT THE STATE AND 
20:19:41 FEDERAL LEVEL.

20:19:53 SOME OTHER HIGHLIGHTS FROM OUR WORK LAST YEAR, WE'VE BEEN CONTINUING WITH 
20:19:59 OUR FEDERAL AND STATE REPRESENTATIVES, AND SOME OUTCOMES, THE CITY HAS BEEN 
20:20:02 SUCCESSFUL REALLY ESTABLISHING THOSE PARTNERSHIPS AT THE STATE LEVEL.

20:20:08 AS MANY OF YOU WERE AT THE CHECK CEREMONY, WE WERE HAPPY TO BE AWARDED 
20:20:18 $7.2 MILLION IN THE STATE BUDGET PROCESS FOR THE  86/80 BOULEVARD 
20:20:24 CHANGE, A PROJECT THAT HAS BEEN VERY IMPORTANT TO PUBLIC WORKS FOR A NUMBER 
20:20:25 OF YEARS.

20:20:34 ADDITIONALLY, NOW IT'S AWARDED UNDER THE COMMUNITY PROJECT FUNDING PROCESS 
20:20:43 AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL, FOR THE HOUSING NAVIGATION CENTER AND THE EMERGENCY 
20:20:47 PROCESS AGAIN, HOPEFULLY WE'LL BE SUCCESSFUL WITH SOME OF THE CITY'S 
20:20:48 PRIORITIES PROJECTS.

20:20:54 ANOTHER BIG THING TO NOTE THIS YEAR, THE IMPORTANCE OF OUR PRIORITIES BEING 
20:20:59 PASSED IS WE HAVE SOME PRETTY BIG OPPORTUNITIES TO BE COMPETITIVE AS A 
20:21:04 CITY, PARTICIPATING AND APPLYING FOR CERTAIN FUNDING COMING DOWN FROM THE 
20:21:09 FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, IN PARTICULAR, WE ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO THE PROGRAMS OF 
20:21:16 THE BIPARTISAN INFRASTRUCTURE LAW THAT WILL PRESENT SOME PRETTY ADEQUATE 
20:21:17 OPPORTUNITIES FOR CITIES TO APPLY FOR FUNDING.

20:21:26 SOME NEXT STEPS, WE HOPE TO APPROVE THE LEGISLATIVE PRINCIPLES TONIGHT, AND AS 
20:21:29 MENTIONED, WE WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR LEGISLATION AGAINST THESE PRINCIPLES 
20:21:36 AND PRIORITIES AND SUBMIT LETTERS OF SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION, AND JUST A 
20:21:40 FINAL DEADLINE AT THE STATE LEVEL, AT LEAST, THE GOVERNOR MUST SUBMIT OR 
20:21:41 ASSIGN BILLS BY  SEPTEMBER 30TH.

20:21:50 SO THE LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM PRETTY MUCH SPANS THE ENTIRE CALENDAR YEAR.

20:21:54 WITH THAT, THAT CONCLUDES MY PRESENTATION, SO I GUESS WE'LL OPEN IT 
20:21:55 UP NOW FOR QUESTIONS.

20:21:58 FRUSH THANK YOU.

20:22:01 THANK YOU.

20:22:03 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION.

20:22:13 I'LL ASK FOR CLARIFYING  QUESTIONS FROM THE CALENDAR,.

20:22:14 >> Councilmember Kassan: I DID HAVE SOME QUESTIONS.

20:22:17 WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO OPPOSE MANDATORY SOCIAL SECURITY COVERAGE?

20:22:25 >> DO YOU WANT ME TO JUMP IN THERE, AMANDA?

20:22:31 WE WILL DO OUR BEST TO ANSWER AS MANY OF THE QUESTIONS THAT WE DID, AND I DO 
20:22:39 HAVE SOME OF  OUR -- I WILL ALSO SAY THEY'RE NOT ALL ON, SO WE MAY HAVE A 
20:22:44 COUPLE OF QUESTIONS THAT WE'RE UNABLE TO ANSWER AND WE CAN KIND OF DECIDE AT 
20:22:47 THAT POINT IN TIME WA HE WOULD RESPOND.

20:22:53  IN TIME HOW WE WOULD RESPOND.

20:22:56 SOME OF OUR STATEMENTS WHEN WE'RE TAKING A STANCE OF BEING OPPOSED TO 
20:23:01 SOMETHING DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN THAT WE WOULDN'T REVIEW IT, ASSESS IT, 
20:23:01 EVALUATE IT.

20:23:07 IT JUST MEANS THAT WE WANT TO DO OUR BEST TO MAINTAIN CONTROL, SO ANY ANY 
20:23:12 LEGISLATION THAT REMOVES OUR CONTROL BY MAKING SOMETHING MANDATORY IS ALWAYS A 
20:23:21 CONCERN IF WE DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO EVALUATE IT AND MAINTAIN THAT CONTROL 
20:23:22 AT THE LOCAL LEVEL.

20:23:28 SO I HOPE THAT ANSWERS THAT QUESTION, BUT I DO ALSO HAVE ALLEN DEMEARS ON, 
20:23:28 AND HE'S AVAILABLE.

20:23:30 >> Councilmember Kassan: OKAY, YEAH.

20:23:33 BECAUSE I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT MEANS.

20:23:46 IN WHAT CIRCUMSTANCE WOULD --

20:23:54 >> THE EMPLOYEES ARE ENROLLED IN CALPERS AND, AS SUCH, ARE GENERALLY 
20:24:04 SPEAKING NOT PARTICIPATING IN SOCIAL SECURITY AND FOR THAT REASON WE WOULD 
20:24:09 NOT WANT TO PROVIDE FOR A BENEFIT THAT IS UNNECESSARY.

20:24:12 >> Councilmember Kassan: OKAY, THANK YOU.

20:24:13 THAT DOES EXPLAIN IT.

20:24:14 I THINK THAT WAS MY ONLY QUESTION.

20:24:20 THERE WERE DEFINITELY SEVERAL THINGS ON THE LIST THAT I DO NOT AGREE WITH, BUT 
20:24:25 I DON'T HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT THEM, SO I DON'T THINK I NEED TO SAY ANYTHING 
20:24:25 ELSE.

20:24:34 >> Mayor Mei: YOU'RE WELCOME TO SHARE THAT IF YOU HAVE ANY OTHER ADDITIONAL 
20:24:34 COMMENTS.

20:24:37 COUNCILMEMBER COX, CLARIFYING QUESTIONS.

20:24:39 I THINK WE ALSO HAVE ONE PUBLIC SPEAKER.

20:24:42 WELCOME.

20:24:46 >> Councilmember Cox: YES, I WANTED TO HAVE A REFRESH ON AWARDED FUNDING 
20:24:53 UNDER THE FEDERAL COMMUNITY PROJECT FUNDING THAT WAS FOR THE EMERGENCY 
20:24:54 DISPATCH CENTER.

20:25:02 KOL YOU SHARE A LITTLE BIT MORE?

20:25:12 >> MS. GALLO:  UNDER THE PROJECT LAST YEAR, THE EMERGENCY DISPATCH CENTER 
20:25:17 PROJECT, THAT FUNDING WOULD SUPPORT UPGRADES TO THE SYSTEM AND THE 
20:25:22  DISPATCHER -- I GUESS ON THE TECHNOLOGY SIDE, ALLOWING FOR QUICKER 
20:25:28 RESPONSE TIMES OR MORE CONNECTIVITY, ESPECIALLY  IMPROVING OUR ABILITY TO 
20:25:41 COMMUNICATE ALSO WITH UNION CITY DEPARTMENT THAT ALSO FREE  QENTS -- 
20:25:44 IT'S REALLY A TECHNOLOGY UPGRADE.

20:25:44 >> GOD IT.

20:25:49 NOW THAT YOU SAID TECHNOLOGY, I REMEMBER WE DID APPROVE IT DURING OUR 
20:25:51 CITY COUNCIL MEETING, SO THANK YOU FOR REFRESHING.

20:26:00  REFRESHING THE ACTIONS WE TOOK.

20:26:03 IT WAS JUST THE TERMINOLOGY THAT THREW ME OFF.

20:26:08 IN REGARDS TO SOME OF THE THINGS COMING DOWN, THAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT TO TACKLE 
20:26:08 THIS YEAR?

20:26:14 CAN YOU SAY A FEW OR ARE YOU STILL RESEARCHING SOME OF THE INFORMATION 
20:26:14 RIGHT NOW?

20:26:21 >> WE DON'T HAVE SPECIFIC LEGISLATION TO SHARE TODAY.

20:26:29 WE'RE REALLY WAITING FOR YOU TO ADOPT THE POLICY LEVEL THE PRIORITIES FOR US 
20:26:29 TO START TO WORK UNDER.

20:26:39 WE DO INTEND TO SHARE THE LEGISLATION THAT WE ARE EITHER WATCHING OR 
20:26:46 ADVOCATING FOR, BUT I CAN TELL YOU AT THE STATE LEVEL, THE PRIORITIES ARE 
20:26:50 HOUSING, CRITICAL  INFRASTRUCTURE, DISASTER PREPAREDNESS, THOSE REALLY 
20:26:54 THE HIGHEST PRIORITIES WHERE WE ANTICIPATE THEY ALIGN VERY NICELY WITH 
20:26:58 OUR OWN INTEREST AND PRIORITIES AND WILL BE A FOCUS THIS UPCOMING YEAR AT 
20:26:59 THE STATE LEVEL.

20:27:12 THEN AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL, ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENT AND THE FEDERAL BUDGET.

20:27:14 SO THOSE ARE AT A HIGH LEVEL THE FOCUS AREAS.

20:27:16 >> Councilmember Cox: THANK YOU FOR SHARING THAT.

20:27:21 I LIKE THE PRESENTATION, HOW IT'S BEING BROUGHT OUT AND HOW IT'S BEING ALIGNED 
20:27:25 WITH OUR GOALS AND OUR PRIORITY, AND MAYBE JUST KIND OF TIGHTEN A LITTLE 
20:27:29 BIT WITH THE COMPARISON CHART TO SAY HERE'S WHERE WE'RE GOING AND MAYBE 
20:27:36 REFLECTING WHICH BILLS THAT WE WENT AND SUBMITTED LETTERS IN SUPPORT OR 
20:27:44 OPPOSED, JUST SO IT'S KIND OF CLEAR ON -- WHEN YOU MENTIONED 12 BILLS AND A 
20:27:48 BREAKDOWN BETWEEN THE FEDERAL AND STATE, IT WOULD BE GREAT TO SEE LIKE 
20:27:56 WHAT WERE THOSE 12, AND WHAT WERE THE BILLS, AND WHAT WAS POSITION BECAUSE I'M NOT SURE 

20:27:58 IF THE I'M GETTING COPIED ON 

20:27:59 EVERY SINGLE LETTER THAT GOES 

20:28:01 OUT IN SUPPORT OR NOT IN 

20:28:01 SUPPORT.

20:28:03 SO THAT WOULD BE ALSO TWO 

20:28:05 RECOMMENDATIONS THERE THAT WOULD 

20:28:05 BE VERY HELPFUL.

20:28:17 >> THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL.

20:28:20 THESE ARE ALWAYS UPDATED ON 

20:28:21 FREMONT.GOV.

20:28:23 IT IS AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC, 

20:28:26 WE HAVE A CHART ON FREMONT.GOV.

20:28:28 THIS YEAR WE WANT TO ENHANCE OUR 

20:28:29 COMMUNICATION WITH COUNCIL AND 

20:28:32 WE WILL TRY TO KEEP YOU UPDATED 

20:28:36 ON A MOM BASIS AS WELL AS KEEP 

20:28:38 THAT INFORMATION UPDATED ON THE 

20:28:39 WEBSITE.

20:28:42 >> Councilmember Cox:   THAT 

20:28:42 WOULD BE HELPFUL.

20:28:44 WE ARE TRYING TO REENGINEER THE 

20:28:46 WAY THAT WE'RE DOING THING 

20:28:48 LEGISLATIVE BECAUSE THIS IS KIND 

20:28:50 OF A NEW ROLE FOR EVERYONE SO I 

20:28:51 REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR WORK 

20:28:55 GENEVA AND AMANDA AND TEAM AND 

20:28:56 ALL OF THOSE THAT HAVE HEMMED 

20:28:59  HELPED 

20:29:00 AND JUST LOOKING FORWARD TO SOME 

20:29:02 UPDATES AND MAKING IT PICTURE 

20:29:04 CLEAR FOR ALL OF US AND 

20:29:05 ESPECIALLY WHEN WE'RE OUT IN THE 

20:29:07 COMMUNITY AND MAYBE ASK CERTAIN 

20:29:08 QUESTIONS THAT WE CAN THEN TIE 

20:29:11 IT BACK TO WHAT WE'RE DOING AND 

20:29:13 MAKE SURE THAT OUR CONSTITUENTS 

20:29:14 ARE WELL AWARE OF THAT SO THANK 

20:29:14 YOU SO MUCH.

20:29:20 >> Mayor Mei:   COUNCILMEMBER 

20:29:21 KENG.

20:29:22 >> Councilmember Keng:   THANK 

20:29:23 YOU, MADAM MAYOR.

20:29:25 THANK YOU FOR THE STAFF FOR THE 

20:29:27 PRESENTATION AND I APPRECIATE 

20:29:30 THAT WE WILL BE SENDING, WILL BE 

20:29:33 SENT MONTHLY KIND OF REPORTS ON 

20:29:35 THESE BILLS THAT WE'RE 

20:29:37 SUPPORTING OR NOT SUPPORTING.

20:29:38 I'M WONDERING IF THERE IS ANY 

20:29:43 WAY THAT WE CAN RECEIVE THESE 

20:29:45 INFORMATION THAT WE CAN BE 

20:29:46 INFORMED, ONCE THEY ARE SENT 

20:29:51 OUT, SO WE CAN KIND OF KNOW ON A 

20:29:53 MORE TIMELY MANNER IF POSSIBLE 

20:30:01 OR, YOU KNOW, IF WE CAN BE 

20:30:04 SIGNED UP SO WE CAN SIGN UP 

20:30:05 SOONER.

20:30:06 >> SURE, WE DEFINITELY HEAR YOU 

20:30:08 THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO BE 

20:30:09 INFORMED IN A TIMELY MANNER.

20:30:11 LET US TALK ABOUT THAT AND SEIZE 

20:30:14 WHAT WE CAN DO, SURE.

20:30:15 >> Councilmember Keng:   

20:30:17 AWESOME, THANK YOU.

20:30:18 >> Mayor Mei:   LET'S GO TO THE 

20:30:20 PUBLIC SPEAKER AND THEN I'LL 

20:30:22 HAVE SOME COMMENTS TOO.

20:30:24 WELCOME MS. STANCE.

20:30:27 I'D LIKE TO OFTEN THE PUBLIC 

20:30:28 COMMENT COMMENTS.

20:30:30 >> THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY 

20:30:31 TO COMMENT.

20:30:33 THE TOP PRIORITY ITEM, IT IS 

20:30:35 UNDERSTANDABLE THAT FREMONT 

20:30:37 WOULD WANT TO RETAIN AS MUCH 

20:30:40 CONTROL AS POSSIBLE BUTTER THE 

20:30:43 OTHER PART OF THE DOUBLE EDGED 

20:30:45 SWORD, OTHER COMMUNITIES, WE 

20:30:47 KNOW THAT THEY ARE NOT BUILDING 

20:30:51 THEIR SHARE EVER HOUSING.

20:30:52 WORKERS GET PRICED OUT TO 

20:30:54 FURTHER AWAY AREAS SUCH AS THE 

20:30:57 CENTRAL VALLEY AND THE TRIVALLEY 

20:31:02 AREA AND THEN THEY DRIVE THROUGH 

20:31:03 FREMONT ON THEIR WAY.

20:31:05 THIS EXPLAINS IT WELL THE 

20:31:06 MOBILITY ACTION PLAN THAT 

20:31:08 FREMONT PUBLISHED IN 2019 

20:31:09 IDENTIFIES PASS THROUGH TRAFFIC 

20:31:15 DUE THE REGIONAL JOBS HOUSING 

20:31:19 IMBALANCE, UNBRIDLED LOCAL 

20:31:21 CONTROL HAS FAILED US.

20:31:22 CALIFORNIA IS RIGHTLY TRYING A 

20:31:24 NEW APPROACH AND I SINCERELY 

20:31:26 HOPE THAT WE HAVE SUCCESS WITH 

20:31:26 IT.

20:31:30 THIS SUCCESS IS CONTINUING TO 

20:31:33 INNOVATE AND AFFIRMANCE TO LOCAL 

20:31:34 CONTROL WOULD GET IN THE WAY OF 

20:31:34 THAT.

20:31:37 I WOULD ASK THAT YOU REMOVE THE 

20:31:38 LOCAL CONTROL PRINCIPLE FROM THE 

20:31:39 GUIDELINES.

20:31:39 THANK YOU.

20:31:45 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

20:31:51 NEXT SPEAKER IS FP ARGENCANA.

20:31:52 THANK YOU.

20:31:56 >> YES, ACTUALLY, A QUESTION.

20:31:59 SO -- SO FOR THE HOUSING 

20:32:01 PROBLEM, SO IS THE PROBLEM THAT 

20:32:03 WE NEED MORE HOUSING IN FREMONT 

20:32:05 OR IS THERE LIKE A LIMIT ON THE 

20:32:07 AMOUNT OF HOUSES?

20:32:10 BECAUSE I'M QUITE CONFUSED ON 

20:32:10 THAT.

20:32:14 SO YEAH, THAT'S MY QUESTION.

20:32:25 >> Mayor Mei:   NEXT SPEAKER IS 

20:32:25 JOHN HINES.

20:32:29 >> HELLO EVERYONE.

20:32:31 REAL QUICK ON A LOCAL CONTROL.

20:32:34 I THINK IT'S A WELL ESTABLISHED 

20:32:35 UNIVERSAL PRINCIPLE THAT THE 

20:32:38 DECISIONS ARE JUST ALWAYS BETTER 

20:32:41 WHEN THEY'RE MADE BY DISTANT 

20:32:42 STRANGERS WHO DON'T KNOW OUR 

20:32:42 SITUATION.

20:32:46 PREFERABLY STATEWIDE, PREFERABLY 

20:32:49 NATIONWIDE, PREFERABLY 

20:32:50 OUTSOURCED TO THE U.N. OR 

20:32:51 WHOEVER.

20:32:51 THANK YOU.

20:32:57 >> Mayor Mei:   OKAY.

20:32:59 THANK YOU.

20:33:01 I THINK THAT WAS -- I'M GOING TO 

20:33:03 CLOSE THE PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD.

20:33:07 I'LL BRING IT BACK TO THE 

20:33:08 COUNCIL FOR CONVERSATIONS.

20:33:10 I JUST WANTED TO THANK THE STAFF 

20:33:13 FOR THIS, AND IT HAS BEEN A PAST 

20:33:15 PRACTICE IN THE LAST COUPLE 

20:33:17 YEARS THAT WE HAVE ADDED THE WEB 

20:33:18 PAGE WHERE WE HAD THE LETTERS 

20:33:21 THAT SHOW THE SUPPORT, OPPOSE 

20:33:22 AND THE RESULTS.

20:33:24 AND I DO THANK STAFF FOR KEEPING 

20:33:26 THAT UP TO DATE AND WE TRY TO 

20:33:28 KEEP THAT WITH THE INFORMATION.

20:33:30 AND EVERY YEAR THE LEAGUE OF 

20:33:32 CALIFORNIA CITIES STARTS OFF THE 

20:33:34 YEAR AND DOES DO AN UPDATE ON 

20:33:37 LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES.

20:33:38 AND THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES TO 

20:33:40 JOIN COMMITTEES, WHETHER IT'S ON 

20:33:42 HOUSING, ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, 

20:33:44 TRANSPORTATION, PUBLIC SAFETY.

20:33:48 AND SO I AGAIN STRONGLY 

20:33:49 ENCOURAGE THE COUNCILMEMBERS, 

20:33:52 AND I THANK VICE MAYOR SALWAN, 

20:33:54 HE HAS NOW TAKEN A LEADERSHIP 

20:33:56 ROLE IN THE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA 

20:33:58 CITIES TO REPRESENT THE CITY OF 

20:34:00 FREMONT, AND THAT'S IMPORTANT 

20:34:01 FOR US THROUGHOUT THE YEAR I 

20:34:04 THINK WE ALL GET UPDATES ON 

20:34:04 THAT.

20:34:05 AND THERE'S A COMBINATION OF 

20:34:07 BOTH THE LEGISLATIVE PRIORITY 

20:34:08 SESSIONS WHERE THEY BRING 

20:34:10 LEGISLATORS TO COME AND SHARE 

20:34:12 ABOUT SOME OF THEIR OWN 

20:34:13 PRINCIPAL PRIORITIES AS WELL AS 

20:34:15 COMING UP IN MAY THERE'S ALSO AN 

20:34:18 OPPORTUNITY AGAIN FOR A LEG 

20:34:21 ACTION DAY AS COUNCILMEMBERS, OR 

20:34:23 MAYORS, AND COLLECTIVELY TO MAKE 

20:34:25 OUR VOICES HEARD.

20:34:27 IT IS A GREAT OPPORTUNITY, AND I 

20:34:33 ALSO WANT TO THANK CITY MANAGER 

20:34:36 SHACKELFORD WHO HAS BEEN THERE 

20:34:38 MULTIPLE TIMES WITH ME ON THESE 

20:34:38 ISSUES.

20:34:40 I STRONGLY ENCOURAGE THAT, I 

20:34:42 WANT TO THANK OUR CONSULTANTS 

20:34:44 THAT WE HAVE NOW WORKED WITH IN 

20:34:46 SACRAMENTO AS WELL AS AT THE 

20:34:48 FEDERAL LEVEL HAVE BEEN GIVING 

20:34:51  

20:34:54 US UPDATES.

20:34:58 ANOTHER THING, FOR EXAMPLE IN 

20:34:59 TRANSPORTATION AND STOP WASTE 

20:35:02 THEY ALSO LIST THE LEGISLATIVE 

20:35:02 PRIORITIES.

20:35:05 SO WITHIN THE AGENDA OF THE 

20:35:06 ALAMEDA COUNTY TRANSPORTATION 

20:35:07 COMMISSION THERE IS A COMMITTEE, 

20:35:11 THE PUBLIC POLICY LEGISLATIVE, 

20:35:12 AND AT WHICH TIMES THEY DO 

20:35:16 REGULARLY UPDATE FROM OUR LOIBT 

20:35:23  OUR LOIBT 

20:35:26  LOIBTS 

20:35:34  LOBBYISTS.

20:35:36 WHETHER IT'S DOOUFERG THE PERIOD 

20:35:37 OF THE PANDEMIC TO FOCUS ON 

20:35:39 EXTENSIONS OR SUPPORT FOR 

20:35:42 EVICTION OR AT ONE POINT FOR 

20:35:43 CONTINUING FOR THE SNAP PROGRAM 

20:35:45 FOR THE FUNDING FOR THE FREMONT 

20:35:47 FAMILY RESOURCE CENTER AND ALSO 

20:35:49 FOR PROGRAMS THAT HELP ADVOCATE 

20:35:50 FOR REIMBURSEMENT FOR THINGS 

20:35:51 LIKE AT THAT TIME OUR 

20:35:53 VACCINATION EFFORTS AS WELL AS 

20:35:55 PARTNERSHIPS WITH SCHOOLS.

20:35:57 AND OTHER LOCAL AGENCIES SUCH AS 

20:35:58 THE ONES THAT WE TALKED ABOUT 

20:35:59 EARLIER.

20:36:00 AND WE APPRECIATE THEM COMING TO 

20:36:04 SHARE THAT PRESENTATION.

20:36:05 COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN DO YOU HAVE 

20:36:06 SOMETHING TO ADD?

20:36:07 THANK YOU.

20:36:08 >> Councilmember Kassan:   YES I 

20:36:10 DO WANT TO SAY I DISAGREE WITH 

20:36:11 SEVERAL OF THE ITEMS ON THE 

20:36:12 LEGISLATIVE AGENDA.

20:36:14 I WON'T -- WE HAVE A VERY BIG 

20:36:15 ITEM STILL COMING SO I WON'T 

20:36:17 TAKE THE TIME TO GO THROUGH ALL 

20:36:19 THE THINGS I DISAGREE WITH.

20:36:21 BUT I DO JUST WANT TO MENTION 

20:36:23 THAT I AGREE WITH THE CONCERNS 

20:36:26 ABOUT LOCAL CONTROL AS MUCH AS 

20:36:28 WE KNOW WE WILL ALWAYS DO THE 

20:36:28 RIGHT THING.

20:36:30 THERE ARE OTHER CITIES IN OUR 

20:36:31 STATE THAT DON'T.

20:36:33 AND THERE WAS A SPECIFIC ITEM 

20:36:36 RELATED TO PANDEMICS AND NOT 

20:36:38 HAVING ANY STATE MANDATES 

20:36:40 RELATED TO PANDEMICS AND THAT 

20:36:41 REALLY CONCERNS ME.

20:36:44 AND I DO JUST WANT TO REMIND 

20:36:45 EVERYONE THAT IF WE DIDN'T 

20:36:48 SOMETIMES HAVE A HIGHER LEVEL OF 

20:36:51 STANDARDS, WE WOULD STILL HAVE 

20:36:52 RACIAL SEGREGATION.

20:36:55 SO LOCAL CONTROL IS NOT ALWAYS 

20:36:56 THE RIGHT CHOICE.

20:36:58 THANK YOU.

20:36:59 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU FOR 

20:37:00 YOUR COMMENT.

20:37:05 AND AT THIS TIME I'M GOING TO 

20:37:07 CLOSE I THINK -- IS THIS 

20:37:09 SOMETHING THAT -- WELL WE NEED 

20:37:10 TO ADOPT THIS SO WE NEED TO MAKE 

20:37:12 A MOTION I THINK.

20:37:15 IF I CAN GET A MOTION, I SEE 

20:37:16 COUNCILMEMBER JONES, DID YOU 

20:37:18 JUST PUSH YOUR BUTTON?

20:37:20 >> Councilmember Jones:   I DID.

20:37:23 >> Mayor Mei:   AND 

20:37:24 COUNCILMEMBER SHAO TO MAKE THE 

20:37:24 SECOND.

20:37:28 ROLL CALL VOTE PLEASE.

20:37:29 >> The Clerk:   COUNCILMEMBER 

20:37:30 COX, AYE.

20:37:33 COUNCILMEMBER SHAO, AYE.

20:37:34 COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, NO.

20:37:36 COUNCILMEMBER JONES, AYE.

20:37:37 COUNCILMEMBER KENG.

20:37:40 AYE.

20:37:41 VICE MAYOR SALWAN.

20:37:42 AYE.

20:37:43 MAYOR MEI.

20:37:44 >> Mayor Mei:   AYE.

20:37:48 THE MOTION PASSES WITH 

20:37:51 COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN VOTING NAY.

20:37:54 I WANTED TO NOTE THAT WE HAVE A 

20:37:55 STENO CAPTIONER SO WE DO NEED TO 

20:37:57 TAKE A REGULAR BREAK FOR EVERY 

20:37:59 90 MINUTES AND SO I THINK WE'RE 

20:38:00 A LITTLE OVERDUE.

20:38:02 SO WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A TEN 

20:38:03 MINUTE BREAK AND RETURN.

20:38:05 AND I'D ASK THAT IF YOU ARE 

20:38:07 NOT -- IF YOU'RE ON BREAK TO 

20:38:10 KINDLY MUTE YOUR MIC AND ALSO 

20:38:12 TURN OFF YOUR VIDEO AND WE'LL BE 

20:38:13 BACK IN TEN MINUTES.

20:38:13 THANK YOU.

20:40:13 [ RECESS ]

20:47:20 >> Mayor Mei:   WELCOME BACK.

20:47:29 THANK YOU.

20:47:40 SO I'D LIKE TO CALL THE MEETING 

20:47:41 TO ORDER, BACK TO ORDER AND THE 

20:47:44 NEXT ITEM IS ITEMSEND WHICH IS 

20:47:47 COMMUNITY FEEDBACK SURVEYS AND 

20:47:49 THERE'S NO PRESENTATION.

20:47:54 BUT OUR PUBLIC WORKS DIRECTOR 

20:47:56 HANS LARSON IS AVAILABLE FOR 

20:47:58 QUESTIONS AND I FIRST WANTED TO 

20:48:01 SEE IF THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS 

20:48:01 FROM THE COUNCILMEMBERS.

20:48:13 OKAY SEEING NONE I'M GOING TO 

20:48:14 OPEN UP FOR PUBLIC COMMENT.

20:48:24 I SEE THAT WE HAVE ONE SPEAKER 

20:48:30 RIGHT NOW WHICH IS FP ARGENCANA.

20:48:33 >> YES, I WAS CURIOUS, ABOUT 

20:48:34 THIS SURVEY, SO HOW IS THIS 

20:48:35 CONDUCTED?

20:48:40 AND ALSO, ARE THERE ANY 

20:48:43 CONFLICTING LIKE OPINIONS ON IT?

20:48:46 BECAUSE LIKE WHAT'S -- SO HOW DO 

20:48:51 YOU GET THE -- A -- THE ANSWERS 

20:48:56 TO THE SURVEY WAS IT LIKE HOW 

20:48:57 WAS THE SURVEY DONE?

20:49:01 I'M DONE TALKING.

20:49:04 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

20:49:12 ARE THERE ANY OTHER SPEAKERS?

20:49:15 AT THIS TIME I'M GOING TO CLOSE 

20:49:16 THE PUBLIC COMMENT.

20:49:18 THE NOTHING ELSE I GUESS I'M 

20:49:20 LOOKING FOR -- WE'LL BRING IT 

20:49:23 BACK TO OUR PANELISTS FOR A 

20:49:24 CONVERSATION.

20:49:27 COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN.

20:49:27 >> Councilmember Kassan:   YES I 

20:49:29 WAS HOPING TO HEAR FROM MEMBERS 

20:49:30 OF THE MOBILITY COMMISSION 

20:49:32 BECAUSE -- AND I DO SEE MAYBE 

20:49:33 ONE OR TWO ARE HERE.

20:49:35 BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THERE WAS 

20:49:37 SOME CONCERN EXPRESSED THAT THEY 

20:49:39 WEREN'T NECESSARILY CONSULTED ON 

20:49:43 SOME OF THE DECISIONS REGARDING 

20:49:45 CHANGES TO OUR STREETS.

20:49:47 BUT IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE NOT 

20:49:48 WANTING TO SPEAK.

20:49:51 SO THAT'S UNFORTUNATE.

20:49:52 BUT I GUESS I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR 

20:49:56 A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT, YOU 

20:49:59 KNOW, I -- I DID MAKE A REFERRAL 

20:50:01 FOR THIS ITEM TO COME TO 

20:50:02 COUNCIL.

20:50:04 AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS THAT 

20:50:09 WE'VE MADE SOME VERY -- VERY 

20:50:10 IMPACTFUL DECISIONS REGARDING 

20:50:14 THE STREETS, WHETHER THEY WOULD 

20:50:15 BE, YOU KNOW, ONE LANE IN EACH 

20:50:17 DIRECTION OR TWO, WHETHER THEY 

20:50:20 WOULD BE, YOU KNOW, 

20:50:22 SUPERSUBSTANDARD BIKE LANES OR 

20:50:24 PROBATED BIKE LANES YOU KNOW ALL 

20:50:24 OF THAT.

20:50:29 AND I WAS CONCERNED THAT THE 

20:50:31 MOBILITY COMMISSION -- MEMBERS 

20:50:32 OF THE MOBILE COMMISSION 

20:50:34 EXPRESSED THAT THEY HAD NOT HAD 

20:50:35 AN OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE THEIR 

20:50:37 INPUT ON SOME OF THOSE 

20:50:38 DECISIONS.

20:50:41 AND OF COURSE, THAT THE SURVEYS 

20:50:43 THAT WERE DONE WERE COMPLETELY 

20:50:48 UNSCIENTIFIC AND VERY EASILY, 

20:50:49 YOU KNOW, BIASED IN FAVOR OF 

20:50:50 PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE LOUDEST 

20:50:52 VOICES AND HAVE THE MOST FREE 

20:50:53 TIME TO RESPOND.

20:50:55 BUT I THINK WE HAVE, YOU KNOW, 

20:50:56 SOME GOOD ANSWERS ABOUT THE 

20:50:58 SURVEY PART OF THAT.

20:51:00 BUT IN TERMS OF THE MOBILITY 

20:51:02 COMMISSION I DON'T FEEL I'M 

20:51:04 GETTING -- I'M NOT SEEING LIKE A 

20:51:05 CLEAR EXPLANATION AS TO WHY 

20:51:06 MEMBERS OF THE MOBILITY 

20:51:08 COMMISSION HAD COMPLAINED THAT 

20:51:10 THEY WEREN'T ABLE TO WEIGH IN ON 

20:51:11 THOSE DECISIONS.

20:51:17 >> Hans Larsen:   MAYOR MEI IF 

20:51:19 YOU WOULD LIKE ME TO ADDRESS 

20:51:21 THAT I'M HAPPY TO.

20:51:22 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

20:51:23 >> Hans Larsen:   SO I THINK 

20:51:24 JUST KIND OF SPEAKING IN TERMS 

20:51:27 OF HOW THE MOBILITY COMMISSION 

20:51:27 OPERATES.

20:51:29 SO THEY DO ANNUALLY PUT TOGETHER 

20:51:33 A WORK PLAN AND DECIDE SORT OF 

20:51:35 WHERE THEY WANT TO FOCUS THEIR 

20:51:37 TIME AND EFFORTS.

20:51:38 AND GENERALLY THE DISCUSSIONS 

20:51:40 WE'VE HAD IS THAT WHERE WE 

20:51:42 HAVE -- GENERALLY THEY WORK ON 

20:51:45 HOW CAN WE ENGAGE THE COMMUNITY 

20:51:48 AND MODE-SHIFT OR SAFE ROUTES TO 

20:51:49 SCHOOL PROGRAM.

20:51:53 SO THERE'S AN ORIENTATION AROUND 

20:51:54 THEIR CONNECTING WITH THE 

20:51:57 COMMUNITY TO SORT OF ACHIEVE 

20:52:00 CERTAIN TRANSPORTATION GOALS.

20:52:03 AND THEN THEY GET MORE ENGAGED 

20:52:05 AT -- WHEN WE'RE ENGAGED IN A 

20:52:08 SORT OF A KIND OF LARGER 

20:52:10 CITYWIDE PLANNING EFFORT.

20:52:12 AND SO A COUPLE OF RECENT 

20:52:16 EXAMPLES ARE THE CITYWIDE TRAIL 

20:52:17 STRATEGY AND MASTER PLAN THAT 

20:52:18 WILL BE INVOLVED WITH THE 

20:52:21 BICYCLE AND PEDESTRIAN MASTER 

20:52:21 PLANS.

20:52:23 THEY WERE INVOLVED WITH THE 

20:52:25 UPDATE TO THE VISION ZERO PLAN.

20:52:28 AND SO WE DO HAVE WHEN WE 

20:52:30 IMPLEMENT INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS, 

20:52:33 AND IN OUR STAFF REPORT WE CITED 

20:52:35 NUMBERS OF THOSE WHERE LIKE 

20:52:37 CENTERVILLE COMPLETE STREETS OR 

20:52:39 THE SABERCAT TRAIL EXTENSION 

20:52:41 PROJECT, WHERE WE HAVE AN 

20:52:45 OPPORTUNITY AND DO SPECIFIC 

20:52:47 COMMUNITY OUTREACH ON THOSE 

20:52:48 PARTICULAR PROJECTS, WE INFORM 

20:52:50 THE COMMISSION OF THESE 

20:52:52 OPPORTUNITIES, AND INVITE THEM 

20:52:55 TO PARTICIPATE IN THOSE EFFORTS.

20:52:58 AND THEN TO -- AND AS A WAY TO 

20:53:00 SORT OF JUST MANAGE THE TIME OF 

20:53:02 THE VOLUNTEER COMMISSIONERS, NOT 

20:53:06 TRY TO DUPLICATE KIND OF A 

20:53:08 COMMUNITY REVIEW PROCESS THROUGH 

20:53:12 COMMISSION, AS TYPICALLY DONE 

20:53:13 THROUGH SAY A PLANNING 

20:53:14 COMMISSION EXAMPLE.

20:53:16 NOT TO DUPLICATE THAT MOBILITY 

20:53:18 COMMISSION BUT THESE THINGS THEN 

20:53:20 GENERALLY GO DIRECTLY TO THE 

20:53:22 CITY COUNCIL FOLLOWING A BROADER 

20:53:23 COMMUNITY REVIEW PROCESS.

20:53:26 AND SO THE EFFORT IS NOT TO 

20:53:28 DUPLICATE EFFORTS THAT ARE DONE.

20:53:30 YOU KNOW, I WOULD SAY I THINK 

20:53:32 THE ONE INSTANCE WHERE THERE WAS 

20:53:34 CONCERN EXPRESSED BY THE 

20:53:39 MOBILITY COMMISSION WAS WHEN -- 

20:53:41 AND THIS RELATED TO THE PASEO 

20:53:44 PADRE PARKWAY PROJECT WHICH WILL 

20:53:46 BE COMING TO COUNCIL NEXT WEEK.

20:53:50 THERE WAS A COMMUNITY PROCESS 

20:53:51 AND THEN AN ACTION RELATED TO 

20:53:54 THE ITEM WAS PULLED OFF THE 

20:53:55 CONSENT CALENDAR.

20:53:57 AND THERE REALLY WASN'T AN 

20:53:59 OPPORTUNITY TO KNOW OF THAT OR 

20:54:01 WEIGH IN ON THAT.

20:54:03 AND, YOU KNOW, WE HEARD FROM 

20:54:06 MEMBERS OF THE MOBILITY 

20:54:08 COMMISSION ABOUT SORT OF NOT 

20:54:11 HAVING A PROCESS TO KNOW OR 

20:54:12 THAT, YOU KNOW, SOMETHING OF 

20:54:13 SIGNIFICANCE WAS AT COUNCIL THAT 

20:54:15 THEY WOULD HAVE WANTED TO WEIGH 

20:54:16 IN ON.

20:54:19 SO IT WAS MORE OF I THINK A 

20:54:21 SINGLE INSTANCE AS OPPOSED TO 

20:54:23 THE OVERALL PROCESS OF WORKING 

20:54:24 WITH THE COMMISSION.

20:54:27 SO HOPEFULLY, THAT, YOU KNOW, 

20:54:29 SORT OF HELPS KIND OF ADDRESS 

20:54:31 THE ROOT OF THE CONCERNS THAT 

20:54:34 SOME COMMISSIONERS EXPRESSED ON 

20:54:36 A PAST INSTANCE.

20:54:38 BUT GENERALLY, AS I MENTIONED WE 

20:54:40 DON'T TRY TO DUPLICATE COMMUNITY 

20:54:42 OUTREACH EFFORTS OR DECISIONS 

20:54:45 THAT ARE BEING DEBATED BY 

20:54:47 COUNCIL AS A POLICY OR PROJECT 

20:54:47 ACTION.

20:54:50 >> Councilmember Kassan:   I 

20:54:52 WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A REQUEST 

20:54:54 THAT WE MAKE A CHANGE TO THAT 

20:54:56 POLICY.

20:54:58 THESE DECISION HE ARE INCREDIBLY 

20:55:01  

20:55:03 CONSEQUENTIAL FOR PEOPLE LIVING 

20:55:05 OR DYING FOR BUSINESSES 

20:55:08 OPERATING OR FAILING, FOR A CITY 

20:55:10 THAT PEOPLE WANT TO SPEND TIME 

20:55:13 IN VERSUS A CITY PEOPLE QUICKLY 

20:55:14 DRIVE THROUGH.

20:55:15 I THINK WHEN WE MAKE THESE 

20:55:17 DECISIONS NOT ONLY SHOULD THE 

20:55:18 MOBILITY COMMISSION TALK ABOUT 

20:55:21 WHAT THEIR INPUT IS BECAUSE 

20:55:22 UNLIKE THE GENERAL PUBLIC THESE 

20:55:24 ARE PEOPLE WHO WERE CHOSEN FOR 

20:55:26 THEIR PARTICULAR EXPERTISE AND 

20:55:28 THOUGHTFULNESS ON THESE ITEMS.

20:55:30 THERE IS ALSO OTHER COMMISSIONS 

20:55:33 THAT I THINK SHOULD BE CONSULTED 

20:55:36 LIKE SENIORS, YOU KNOW ANYONE 

20:55:37 WHO IS AFFECTED BY THESE 

20:55:40 DECISIONS, WE HAVE COMMISSION -- 

20:55:41 I THINK THAT IS A PERFECT ROLE 

20:55:42 FOR COMMISSIONS.

20:55:44 I THINK I REALLY, REALLY 

20:55:46 DISAGREE WITH THE POLICY OF NOT 

20:55:48 SPECIFICALLY GETTING INPUT FROM 

20:55:49 THE COMMISSIONS ON THESE 

20:55:51 QUESTIONS.

20:55:54 I JUST -- I DON'T KNOW.

20:55:56 IT SEEMS LIKE PEOPLE AREN'T U.C. 

20:55:58 UNDERSTANDING THE SERIOUSNESS OF 

20:55:59 THESE DECISIONS.

20:56:02 THEY ARE GOING TO AFFECT THE 

20:56:04 FUTURE OF OUR CITY FOR YEARS AND 

20:56:06 YEARS TO COME AND I JUST DON'T 

20:56:09 THINK IT'S THAT DIFFICULT TO GET 

20:56:12 INPUT FROM THE COMMISSIONS THAT 

20:56:14 WERE SPECIFICALLY CHOSEN TO 

20:56:15 REPRESENT CERTAIN INTERESTS AND 

20:56:18 CERTAIN KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERTISE.

20:56:19 SO I DON'T KNOW IF THAT WOULD BE 

20:56:20 A MOTION.

20:56:22 BUT I WOULD LIKE TO REQUEST THAT 

20:56:26 WE CHANGE OUR POLICY ON THAT.

20:56:27 >> Hans Larsen:   IF I COULD 

20:56:28 SORT OF ADD TO THAT.

20:56:30 I THINK IT'S A BIT SO THAT WHEN 

20:56:32 THE MOBILITY COMMISSION WAS SET 

20:56:34 UP, THEY MEET QUARTERLY.

20:56:39 AND SO THEIR -- I THINK PART OF 

20:56:41 IT IS, CAN YOU GET PEOPLE IN THE 

20:56:43 COMMUNITY THAT CAN -- IN ORDER 

20:56:45 TO PROVIDE TIMELY INPUT ON 

20:56:46 DIFFERENT THINGS IF YOU GOT A 

20:56:48 COMMISSION THAT'S MEETING 

20:56:50 QUARTERLY THAT'S NOT REALLY AT A 

20:56:51 LEVEL OF FREQUENCY THAT WOULD BE 

20:56:53 ABLE TO SUPPORT EVERY PROJECT 

20:56:55 COMING THROUGH A REVIEW PROCESS 

20:56:56 WITH THEM.

20:56:57 AND SO JUST TO SHARE WITH THE 

20:56:59 COUNCIL, I MEAN THERE'S 

20:57:02 CERTAINLY A STAFF BANDWIDTH 

20:57:04 PERSPECTIVE, THERE IS ALSO AN 

20:57:05 ELEMENT OF MEMBERS OF THE 

20:57:08 COMMUNITY WILLING TO HAVE AN 

20:57:10 ACTIVE LEVEL OF PARTICIPATION 

20:57:12 THAT THEY'D BE ABLE TO WEIGH IN 

20:57:14 ON EVERY PROJECT THAT COMES 

20:57:15 THROUGH.

20:57:17 AND SO WHEN THE COMMISSION WAS 

20:57:20 STRUCTURED IT WAS QUARTERLY, AND 

20:57:22 THEN BASED ON WHAT THEY CHOOSE 

20:57:25 TO WORK ON, IS BASED ON THE 

20:57:27 AMOUNT OF TIME THAT THEY HAVE 

20:57:28 AVAILABLE FOR THEIR MEETINGS AND 

20:57:31 WHAT THEY THINK IS MOST 

20:57:33 IMPORTANT FOR THE TIME THAT 

20:57:35 THEY'RE ABLE TO PROVIDE AS 

20:57:35 COMMUNITY VOLUNTEERS.

20:57:43 >> Mayor Mei:   COUNCILMEMBER 

20:57:44 JONES.

20:57:45 >> Councilmember Jones:   THANK 

20:57:46 YOU, MADAM MAYOR.

20:57:50 JUST A QUICK QUESTION FOR CITY 

20:57:51 MANAGER SHACKELFORD.

20:57:53 IN THE PAST JUST CLARIFY WE HAVE 

20:57:55 TAKEN INPUT FROM THE MOBILITY 

20:57:58 COMMISSION, THE HUMAN RELATIONS 

20:57:59 COMMISSION THE SENIOR COMMISSION 

20:58:02 ON ISSUES THAT THEY BELIEVE ARE 

20:58:06 IMPORTANT, AND ON (INAUDIBLE) IS 

20:58:06 THAT CORRECT?

20:58:09 NOT NECESSARILY RECOMMENDATIONS 

20:58:11 BUT THEY HAVE EXPRESSED THEIR 

20:58:15 CONCERNS, OR THEIR --

20:58:15 >> Karena Shackelford:   THAT IS 

20:58:17 CORRECT.

20:58:17 THAT IS CORRECT COUNCILMEMBER 

20:58:21 JONES, THEY HAVE.

20:58:21 >> Councilmember Jones:   THANK 

20:58:22 YOU.

20:58:23 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

20:58:23 COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN.

20:58:29 >> Councilmember Salwan:   THANK 

20:58:30 YOU MADAM MAYOR.

20:58:31 I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE 

20:58:33 COMMISSIONERS WHO HAVE WEIGHED 

20:58:34 IN ON VARIOUS ISSUES THAT HAVE 

20:58:36 COME BEFORE US.

20:58:38 MANY TIMES WE'VE HAD MOBILITY 

20:58:39 COMMISSIONERS COME, THE CHAIR OF 

20:58:41 THE MOBILITY COMMISSION USUALLY 

20:58:44 SPEAKS AT SEVERAL OF OUR 

20:58:44 MEETINGS.

20:58:46 SO I DO FEEL THE COMMISSIONS ARE 

20:58:48 WELL REPRESENTED.

20:58:49 I DON'T FEEL LIKE THEY'RE NOT 

20:58:50 REPRESENTED.

20:58:52 BUT WE DO HAVE THE GENERAL 

20:58:54 PUBLIC WHICH IS, YOU KNOW, THE 

20:58:57 JOE CITIZEN OUT THERE, RESIDENT 

20:58:59 WHO, YOU KNOW, WANTS TO GIVE 

20:59:00 THEIR OWN FEEDBACK.

20:59:02 AND SOMETIMES, YOU KNOW, WE HAVE 

20:59:04 OUR LITTLE ECHO CHAMBER SO IT'S 

20:59:05 GOOD TO HEAR FROM THE PERSON ON 

20:59:07 THE STREET AND TO SEE WHAT THEIR 

20:59:09 FEEDBACK IS.

20:59:11 AND I APPRECIATE THESE SURVEYS 

20:59:12 BECAUSE IT'S KIND OF A REALITY 

20:59:14 CHECK THAT BECAUSE SOMETIMES 

20:59:16 THERE'S A DISCONNECT BETWEEN THE 

20:59:17 POLICY MAKERS AND THE PEOPLE 

20:59:20 THAT LIVE THE DAY-TO-DAY LIVES.

20:59:21 AND SO THE MORE WE CAN 

20:59:22 UNDERSTAND WHERE THE RESIDENTS 

20:59:24 ARE COMING FROM, THE BETTER 

20:59:26 POLICIES WE CAN MAKE, THE BETTER 

20:59:27 WAYS WE CAN ADJUST TO THE 

20:59:29 CRITICISM OR CONCERNS THAT THEY 

20:59:29 HAVE.

20:59:31 SO I THINK THERE'S ROOM FOR 

20:59:32 BOTH.

20:59:33 I DON'T THINK THERE'S AN 

20:59:34 EITHER-OR.

20:59:35 WE DON'T HAVE TO PRIORITIZE ONE 

20:59:36 OVER THE OTHER.

20:59:38 I THINK WE NEED ALL OF THE ABOVE 

20:59:39 AND SO THESE ARE JUST DIFFERENT 

20:59:41 TOOLS TO HELP US MAKE THE BEST 

20:59:44 DECISIONS FOR OUR COMMUNITY.

20:59:46 AND SO I APPRECIATE WHAT YOU 

20:59:47 GUYS ARE DOING AND I THINK THAT 

20:59:49 THERE'S ROOM FOR ALL OF THIS.

20:59:53 SO THANK YOU FOR THAT.

20:59:54 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

20:59:57 NEXT IS COUNCILMEMBER COX.

20:59:57 >> Councilmember Cox:   THANK 

20:59:59 YOU.

21:00:01 HANS, I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU 

21:00:02 SHARING THIS INFORMATION.

21:00:05 I JUST THINK THAT ESPECIALLY 

21:00:07 WITH SOMETHING COMING UP NEXT 

21:00:09 WEEK ON PASEO PADRE, IT WOULD BE 

21:00:10 REALLY WONDERFUL IF WE CAN MAKE 

21:00:12 SURE THAT OUR COMMISSIONS THAT 

21:00:16 ARE IMPACTED AND ECHOING WHAT 

21:00:19 COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN HAS SAID, 

21:00:20 AS WELL AS COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN, 

21:00:23 THAT WE JUST MAKE SURE THAT IT'S 

21:00:26 COMMUNICATED OUT THAT WE'RE 

21:00:27 GETTING, REACHING OUT TO ALL THE 

21:00:28 DIFFERENT COMMISSIONS.

21:00:29 BECAUSE THIS PASEO PADRE IS 

21:00:31 GOING TO BE A BIG DISCUSSION FOR 

21:00:32 NEXT WEEK AND I JUST WANT TO 

21:00:36 MAKE SURE WE'RE TAPPING INTO AND 

21:00:37 OUTREACHING WITH THE DIFFERENT 

21:00:38 GROUPS TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S 

21:00:40 A VOICE AND OPINION.

21:00:42 AND I ESPECIALLY WANTED TO 

21:00:44 COMMEND THAT YOUNG PERSON THAT 

21:00:46 SPOKE TWICE ON THE PUBLIC 

21:00:48 COMMENTS, BECAUSE THAT'S 

21:00:50 IMPORTANT TOO, HAVING OUR YOUTH 

21:00:52 COMMISSION BEING ABLE TO HAVE A 

21:00:54 VOICE ON SOME OF OUR DECISIONS 

21:00:57 THAT WOULD IMPACT THEM.

21:00:58 AS WELL AS OUR SENIORS, AND ALL 

21:01:00 THE OTHER ONES, MOBILITY, AND 

21:01:02 JUST MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE 

21:01:04 ESPECIALLY GETTING A WELL 

21:01:06 ROUNDED OUTPUT OR SOMEWHERE TO 

21:01:09 BE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE AS WE 

21:01:12 APPROACH SOME OF THE UPCOMING 

21:01:13 AGENDA ITEMS THAT THEY GET 

21:01:15 PUSHED OUT TO THE DIFFERENT 

21:01:17 COMMISSIONS AND SHARED SO THAT 

21:01:19 THEY ARE AWARE OF THAT AS WELL.

21:01:21 SOMETIMES WE MAY BE ALL CAUGHT 

21:01:23 UP IN A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS 

21:01:25 AND JUST A LITTLE MORE 

21:01:26 COMMUNICATION MAY BE PUSHING OUT 

21:01:28 IF THAT'S POSSIBLE TO MAKE SURE 

21:01:32 THAT WE DO HAVE A FAIR NUMBER OF 

21:01:33 REPRESENTATION.

21:01:36 AND THE GENERAL PUBLIC AS WELL, 

21:01:36 WHICH COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN HAD 

21:01:39 MENTIONED BUT JUST MAKING SURE 

21:01:42 IT'S TOUCHING UPON ALL THE 

21:01:43 DIFFERENT COMMISSIONS THAT WE 

21:01:44 HAVE.

21:01:46 BECAUSE WE'RE HONORED TO HAVE 

21:01:48 THEM SERVING AS PUBLIC, YOU 

21:01:49 KNOW, GIVING OF THEIR TIME AND 

21:01:52 LABOR TO HELP US WITH THE CITY 

21:01:53 OF FREMONT.

21:01:56 BUT JUST TAPPING INTO SOME OF 

21:01:59 THE COMMISSIONS AND BOARDS AND 

21:02:02 THERE ARE WAYS THAT WE CAN DO 

21:02:04 MORE ADVERTISING OR SOMETHING ON 

21:02:05 THINGS THAT NEED TO BE MORE 

21:02:07 PUBLICLY WEIGHED IN.

21:02:12 JUST SO THERE'S A COMMUNITY 

21:02:13 VOICES INCLUDING MORE.

21:02:16 MORE IS BETTER THAN LESS SO -- 

21:02:17 AND HELPING US GUIDE US IN 

21:02:19 MAKING THESE DECISIONS SO THANK 

21:02:19 YOU SO MUCH.

21:02:23 >> Mayor Mei:   COUNCILMEMBER 

21:02:23 KASSAN.

21:02:25 >> Councilmember Kassan:   YES, 

21:02:27 WE DON'T MAKE A LOT OF THESE 

21:02:29 MAJOR DECISIONS ABOUT STREET 

21:02:31 CONFIGURATIONS SO I JUST -- I 

21:02:33 FIND IT HARD TO BELIEVE THAT IT 

21:02:37 WOULD BE THAT DIFFICULT TO GET 

21:02:39 COMMISSIONS TO WEIGH IN ON THIS.

21:02:42 ALSO, I JUST -- I WOULD LIKE TO 

21:02:46 ASK EVERYONE TO PLEASE TAKE A 

21:02:51 CLASS ON STATISTICAL ANALYSIS 

21:02:53 101 TO UNDERSTAND THAT THESE 

21:02:55 SURVEYS AND THEN WHAT PEOPLE ARE 

21:02:57 SAYING ON NEXTDOOR AS MR. HINES 

21:02:59 BROUGHT UP, THIS IS JUST -- IT 

21:03:01 IS NOT A VALID BASIS ON WHICH TO 

21:03:03 MAKE A DECISION.

21:03:04 THERE IS ABSOLUTELY ZERO 

21:03:05 VALIDITY TO IT.

21:03:09 WHEN WE DID OUR SURVEY OF 

21:03:11 COMMUNITY OPINIONS, IT WAS DONE 

21:03:12 IN A WAY THAT WAS VALID, WHERE 

21:03:15 THEY WERE ABLE TO SAY THERE'S A 

21:03:22 PLUS OR MINUS 4% MARGIN OF I 

21:03:23 FORGET WHAT IT'S CALLED.

21:03:26 AND THAT'S WHEN YOU DO A PROPER 

21:03:28 STATISTICAL SURVEY THAT IS 

21:03:29 ACTUALLY REPRESENTATIVE OF ALL 

21:03:32 THE RESIDENTS OF FREMONT.

21:03:34 DOING THESE SURVEYS IS 

21:03:36 ABSOLUTELY NOT AND IT JUST 

21:03:36 REALLY BOTHERS ME.

21:03:38 AND I KNOW THIS IS WHY THIS CAME 

21:03:40 UP TONIGHT AND THERE WAS SOME 

21:03:41 EXPLANATION ABOUT THAT AND THIS 

21:03:47 WAS ALSO DISCUSSED AT THE PASEO 

21:03:49 PADRE MEETING AND I REALLY 

21:03:52 APPRECIATE THAT AS LOUD AS 

21:03:53 PEOPLE YELL ABOUT THIS IN THE 

21:03:56 SURVEYS AND ON NEXTDOOR IT IS 

21:03:58 NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF A 

21:04:03 STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT SAMPLE 

21:04:06 OF THE CITIZENS OF FREMONT.

21:04:10 IT IS NOT A TOOL TO USE AS 

21:04:11 INFORMATION.

21:04:12 IT IS HELPFUL TO RECEIVE THE 

21:04:14 INFORMATION BUT IT IS ABSOLUTELY 

21:04:16 NOT A BASIS UPON WHICH TO MAKE A 

21:04:18 DECISION AND IT JUST REALLY 

21:04:19 BOTHERS ME WHEN THAT IS WHAT 

21:04:19 HAPPENS.

21:04:22 AND I KNOW WE PROBABLY CANNED 

21:04:26 AFFORD HIRE STATISTICIANS EVERY 

21:04:27 TIME WE ARE MAKING A MAJOR 

21:04:29 DECISION BUT GIVEN THAT WE DON'T 

21:04:31 HAVE THAT DATA THAT IS 

21:04:32 STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT AND 

21:04:34 VALID WE MUST NOT BASE DECISIONS 

21:04:36 ON THOSE SURVEYS.

21:04:49 THANK YOU.

21:04:51 COUNCILMEMBER SHAO.

21:04:51 >> Councilmember Shao:   

21:04:53 NEEDLESS TO SAY THE SURVEY WOULD 

21:04:54 BE ONE OF THE IMPORTANT 

21:04:56 APPROACHES TO OUTREACH THE 

21:04:56 COMMUNITY.

21:05:06 TO BRING AWARENESS TO UPCOMING 

21:05:08 BIG DECISIONS SO THEY CAN 

21:05:10 ANTICIPATE AND PROVIDE FEEDBACK.

21:05:14 I CANNOT DENY THAT THERE'S NO 

21:05:16 ROOM, YOU KNOW, THERE'S ROOM FOR 

21:05:17 IMPROVEMENT.

21:05:20 FOR THE CURRENT SURVEY.

21:05:24 BUT I WOULD HESITATE TO 

21:05:27 COMPLETELY IGNORE AND NEGLECT 

21:05:33 THE INFORMATION THAT WE GET, AND 

21:05:38 EVEN WHEN WE DON'T HAVE ANY 

21:05:45 EVIDENCE TO DISREGARD THE DATA 

21:05:47 THAT WE COLLECT FROM THE SURVEY, 

21:05:50 I THINK IT IS STILL IMPORTANT 

21:05:54 FOR US TO TAKE THAT INTO 

21:05:54 CONSIDERATION.

21:05:57 I'M NOT SAYING THAT, IT'S LIKE 

21:06:03 THE ONLY BASIS FOR OUR DECISION.

21:06:07 HOWEVER, IT IS MORE OF THE WAY 

21:06:10 THAT LOCAL RESIDENTS WOULD USE 

21:06:13 THIS OPPORTUNITY TO EXPRESS 

21:06:14 THEIR OPINIONS.

21:06:15 DIRECTLY ON THE ISSUE.

21:06:19 I MEAN, APART FROM THE COMMUNITY 

21:06:23 MEETINGS WHERE ATTENDANCE MAY 

21:06:25 VARY, ESPECIALLY DURING THE 

21:06:27 PANDEMIC, WHAT ELSE CAN BE MORE 

21:06:29 EFFECTIVE FOR THE CITY 

21:06:31 GOVERNMENT TO BE TRANSPARENT, 

21:06:34 AND PROACTIVE, IN OUTREACHING 

21:06:34 THE COMMUNITY.

21:06:38 NAME ONE.

21:06:43 SO I BELIEVE IT HAS A 

21:06:45 SIGNIFICANCE, AND WE STILL NEED 

21:06:49 TO USE THAT TO SHOW OUR 

21:06:51 TRANSPARENCY, AND 

21:06:51 ACCOUNTABILITY.

21:07:13 VICE MAYOR SALWAN.

21:07:16 >> Councilmember Salwan:   I 

21:07:17 APPRECIATE COUNCILMEMBER SHAO'S 

21:07:19 COMMENTS.

21:07:22 TO DESCRIBE HOW THEY FEEL, THAT 

21:07:24 IS DATA AND THAT GIVES US A CLUE 

21:07:26 AS TO HOW THEY FEEL ABOUT THE 

21:07:26 SITUATION.

21:07:30 WE ARE NOT PAYING $100,000 FOR 

21:07:32 EACH SEA WE DO, OBVIOUSLY WE'RE 

21:07:34 NOT GOING TO DO A FOLLOW AND 

21:07:36 STATS AND ALL THAT KIND OF 

21:07:36 STUFF.

21:07:38 BUT ANYONE WHO IS INTERESTED IN 

21:07:39 A CERTAIN ISSUE THEY CAN WEIGH 

21:07:40 IN AND THAT GIVES YOU SOME 

21:07:42 UNDERSTANDING OF THE SENTIMENT 

21:07:42 OF THE COMMUNITY.

21:07:44 NOW THAT IS JUST ONE OF THE MANY 

21:07:46 DIFFERENT POINTS THAT WE USE TO 

21:07:47 MAKE A DECISION.

21:07:49 WE ALSO HAVE OUR OWN OPINIONS, 

21:07:51 WE HAVE FEEDBACK FROM OUR 

21:07:52 INDIVIDUAL DISTRICTS, COMMUNITY 

21:07:54 MEMBERS, AND JUST, YOU KNOW, 

21:07:56 THERE OUR PROFESSIONALS LIKE 

21:07:57 HANS AND MANY OTHERS.

21:08:00 SO I THINK I WELCOME AS MANY 

21:08:01 DATA POINTS AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE 

21:08:04 THAT GIVES US MORE FEEDBACK, 

21:08:05 MORE INFORMATION AND ALLOWS US 

21:08:08 TO RECONCILE OUR DIFFERENCES 

21:08:09 WITH THE COMMUNITY, WHERE WE ARE 

21:08:13 WHERE, WHERE THEY ARE, AND TRY 

21:08:15 TO MEET THEM SOMEWHERE WHERE 

21:08:16 THERE'S A HAPPY GROUND FOR 

21:08:20 EVERYONE THANKS.

21:08:21 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU, 

21:08:22 COUNCILMEMBER KENG.

21:08:22 >> Councilmember Keng:   THANK 

21:08:23 YOU MADAM MAYOR.

21:08:25 I WOULDN'T REPEAT A LOT OF THE 

21:08:27 THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN SAID BUT I 

21:08:28 DO ENCOURAGE EVERYONE HERE TO 

21:08:31 CONTINUE TO SHARE ABOUT THIS 

21:08:33 PROJECT THAT MANY COMMUNITY 

21:08:35 MEMBERS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT.

21:08:38 AND HOPEFULLY, THEY RECEIVE MORE 

21:08:41 FEEDBACK BY NEXT WEEK'S MEETING.

21:08:43 THANK YOU.

21:08:45 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

21:08:47 COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN.

21:08:47 >> Councilmember Kassan:   I 

21:08:50 WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A MOTION THAT 

21:08:52 EVERY TIME WE'RE MAKING A MAJOR 

21:08:55 DECISION REGARDING, LET'S SAY, A 

21:08:58 ROAD DIET STYLE DECISION, THAT 

21:09:00 IS MAKING A MAJOR CHANGE TO THE 

21:09:03 CONFIGURATION OF A MAJOR STREET 

21:09:05 IN FREMONT, THAT STAFF BE -- 

21:09:10 MAKE ITS BEST EFFORT TO GET 

21:09:13 INPUT FROM THE MOBILITY 

21:09:17 COMMISSION, AS WELL AS THE 

21:09:18 COMMISSION OF SENIORS.

21:09:24 >> Mayor Mei:   COUNCILMEMBER 

21:09:24 JONES.

21:09:28 >> Councilmember Jones:   YES, I 

21:09:33 JUST WANTED TO ASK CITY ATTORNEY 

21:09:35 ALVARADO, IF THAT'S SOMETHING 

21:09:37 THAT COULD BE DONE BASED ON THE 

21:09:39 REFERRAL OR THE IT IS SOMETHING 

21:09:41 THAT ACTUALLY NEEDS TO COME BACK 

21:09:42 AS AN AGENDA ITEM.

21:09:46 >> THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.

21:09:47 STAFF REPORT THIS EVENING IS 

21:09:49 REALLY JUST AN INFORMATIONAL 

21:09:50 ITEM AND REALLY THERE WAS NO 

21:09:51 ACTION RELATED TO IT.

21:09:54 BUT IT CERTAINLY, THE COUNCIL 

21:09:55 MAJORITY CAN DIRECT STAFF TO 

21:09:57 BRING IT BACK WITH THE MOTION 

21:10:00 THAT REFLECTS COUNCIL'S 

21:10:01 DIRECTION, IF THE COUNCIL'S 

21:10:03 INCLINED TO DO THAT THAT'S THE 

21:10:04 SUGGESTION THAT I WOULD HAVE 

21:10:05 THIS EVENING RATHER THAN TO 

21:10:07 ACTUALLY TAKE ACTION THIS 

21:10:07 EVENING.

21:10:09 SO IT'S NOT -- ACTION IS NOT 

21:10:15  

21:10:19 AGENDIZED FOR THIS ACTION.

21:10:20 >> Councilmember Jones:   

21:10:20 COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN I WOULD 

21:10:23 SECOND YOUR MOTION TO BRING THIS 

21:10:28 BACK WITH STAFF INPUT.

21:10:29 >> Councilmember Kassan:   YES.

21:10:31 >> AND THAT WOULD GIVE STAFF THE 

21:10:33 BENEFIT OF CRAFTING LANGUAGES 

21:10:36 FOR COUNCIL THE CONSIDER THAT 

21:10:36 REFLECTS THAT DIRECTION.

21:10:38 OBVIOUSLY THERE IS TERMINOLOGY 

21:10:40 THAT WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO 

21:10:42 FLESH OUT AS TO HOW IT'S GOING 

21:10:45 TO WORK, OPERATIONALLY SPEAKING, 

21:10:46 SO THAT IS AN ADVANTAGE TO COME 

21:10:47 BACK.

21:10:48 >> Mayor Mei:   I HEAR A MOTION 

21:10:50 AND A SECOND.

21:10:52 I SAW A HAND RAISED BUT I THINK 

21:10:55 IT'S NOW LOWERED, TO ASK FOR IT 

21:10:56 TO BE A REFERRAL FOR FUTURE 

21:10:57 AGENDA ITEM.

21:11:00 SO WE HAVE A MOTION AND SECOND.

21:11:04 AND THE HAND IS NOW LOWERED.

21:11:06 >> CAN I JUST ASK FOR CLARITY ON 

21:11:07 WHAT STAFF IS BEING ASKED TO 

21:11:11 BRING BACK, YES.

21:11:11 >> Councilmember Kassan:   SO 

21:11:14 WE'RE ASKING TO BRING BACK 

21:11:15 THE -- A RESOLUTION THAT WOULD 

21:11:20 CREATE A POLICY THAT ASKS STAFF 

21:11:22 WHENEVER THERE'S A MAJOR STREET 

21:11:25 CONFIGURATION CHANGE, TO MAKE 

21:11:29 ITS BEST EFFORT TO SOLICIT THE 

21:11:33 INPUT AND VOTE REGARDING SUPPORT 

21:11:36 OR NONSUPPORT TO BOTH THE 

21:11:38 MOBILITY COMMISSION AND THE 

21:11:40 COMMISSION OF SENIORS WHICH I 

21:11:41 CAN'T REMEMBER THE NAME OF, I'M 

21:11:42 SORRY.

21:11:45 >> Mayor Mei:   SENIOR 

21:11:47 COMMISSION.

21:11:49 I GUESS ONE OF THE THINGS I WANT 

21:11:51 TO CLARIFY, THE OTHER THING WE 

21:11:52 HAVE TALKED ABOUT IS SAFE ROUTES 

21:11:54 TO SCHOOL TOO, SO WOULD THAT 

21:11:56 ALSO INCLUDE -- I KNOW WE HAVE A 

21:11:57 SUBCOMMITTEE WITH THE SCHOOLS 

21:11:59 AND THIS WILL BE ON THAT.

21:12:01 SO I THINK -- I'M JUST WONDERING 

21:12:05 HOW BIG THE BROACH OF SCOPE IS, 

21:12:06 YOU'RE JUST SAYING OR THE 

21:12:07 SENIORS AND FOR THE MOBILITY 

21:12:09 COMMISSION AND THERE ARE 

21:12:10 REPRESENTATIVES ON THE MOBILITY 

21:12:11 COMMISSION FOR THOSE AREAS IN 

21:12:13 FACT WE CAN GET ONE, WE'RE STILL 

21:12:16 LOOKING, WE HAVE BEEN SEEKING 

21:12:20 FOR A PARA OR A MEMBER AND WE 

21:12:22 ALSO HAVE A VACANCY FOR A 

21:12:24 DRIVING MEMBER ON THE MOBILITY 

21:12:26 COMMISSION.

21:12:27 >> Karena Shackelford:   OKAY I 

21:12:28 UNDERSTAND THAT AND I'LL JUST 

21:12:30 SAY IN RESPONSE THE THAT, I 

21:12:32 REALLY FEEL THAT THAT IS 

21:12:33 SOMETHING THAT STAFF CAN JUST DO 

21:12:35 AS A MATTER OF YOU KNOW THE 

21:12:37 COURSE OF BUSINESS IN TERMS OF 

21:12:40 SHARING THE STAFF REPORT WITH 

21:12:41 THOSE COMMISSIONS.

21:12:43 BUT IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR 

21:12:47 SOMETHING MORE THAN THAT, THEN 

21:12:49 WE WILL UNDERSTAND THAT ALSO.

21:12:50 >> Councilmember Kassan:   WHAT 

21:12:52 I WOULD LIKE TO HAPPEN AND I'M 

21:12:53 NOT SAYING IT'S MANDATORY 

21:12:55 BECAUSE I KNOW SOMETIMES TIMING 

21:12:57 MIGHT PREVENT IT FROM BEING 

21:12:57 DONE.

21:13:00 BUT THAT STAFF MAKE ITS BEST 

21:13:02 EFFORT TO GET A VOTE THERE THOSE 

21:13:03 BODIES.

21:13:05 INSTEAD OF JUST SHARING IT WITH 

21:13:05 THEM.

21:13:07 BECAUSE I'M SURE THAT'S ALREADY 

21:13:07 HAPPENING.

21:13:09 BUT I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A VOTE 

21:13:11 FROM THOSE BODIES AND 

21:13:14 DOCUMENTATION OF THEIR -- YOU 

21:13:15 KNOW OF THEIR DISCUSSION ON 

21:13:17 WHETHER THEY SUPPORT IT OR NOT, 

21:13:17 AND WHY.

21:13:21 >> Councilmember Jones:   MADAM 

21:13:22 MAYOR.

21:13:24 >> Mayor Mei:   YES, 

21:13:25 COUNCILMEMBER JONES.

21:13:27 >> Councilmember Jones:   WITH 

21:13:30 CITY MANAGER SHACKELFORD'S 

21:13:31 CLARIFICATION THERE AND HANS 

21:13:32 CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG, BUT YOU 

21:13:34 ARE PROVIDING INPUT SOMEWHAT ON 

21:13:36 A REGULAR BASIS FROM THE 

21:13:37 MOBILITY COMMISSION ON A LOT OF 

21:13:39 THESE PROJECTS ALREADY, IS THAT 

21:13:39 CORRECT?

21:13:40 >> Hans Larsen:   YES.

21:13:43 SO WE, YOU KNOW, FOR PROJECTS, 

21:13:46 SORT OF MAJOR PROJECTS, AND I 

21:13:49 THINK OUR STAFF REPORT KIND OF 

21:13:50 IDENTIFIED MAJOR PROJECTS THAT 

21:13:52 WE'VE HAD.

21:13:54 SOME OF THEM INCLUDE CHANGES TO 

21:13:57 ROAD CONFIGURATION, OTHERS ARE 

21:14:00 NEW TRAILS, A NEW BART STATION, 

21:14:03 SO WE KEEP THE COMMISSION 

21:14:05 INFORMED OF SORT OF THE LARGER 

21:14:07 COMMUNITY OUTREACH PROCESS AND 

21:14:13 OPPORTUNITIES TO ENGAGE IN THE 

21:14:14 PROCESS THAT'S AVAILABLE TO THE 

21:14:15 LARGER PUBLIC.

21:14:17 AND THEN WE ALSO INFORM THEM 

21:14:19 WHEN THESE ACTIONS ARE COMING TO 

21:14:21 THE COUNCIL.

21:14:24 SO AS WAS MENTIONED THE MEMBERS 

21:14:28 OF THE COMMISSION AS THEY HAVE 

21:14:30 TIME AND INTEREST, YOU KNOW, 

21:14:32 WILL COME TO COUNCIL AND PROVIDE 

21:14:34 SORT OF THEIR INPUT ON A 

21:14:37 PARTICULAR ITEM.

21:14:39 NOW I DESTINY WHAT I'M HEARING 

21:14:42 TONIGHT IS HAVING IT GO TO THEM 

21:14:44 AS AN AGENDA ITEM AND HAVE THEM 

21:14:45 ACTUALLY TAKE A VOTE IS KIND OF 

21:14:47 A LEVEL OF DETAIL THAT WE 

21:14:51 HAVEN'T PURSUED.

21:14:53 BUT BASED ON HOW IT WAS 

21:14:58 QUALIFIED AS A MAJOR STREET 

21:15:00 RECONFIGURATION OR A ROAD DIET 

21:15:01 PROJECT WE DON'T HAVE THAT MANY 

21:15:03 OF THOSE, AND I WOULD BE HAPPY 

21:15:06 IF THIS, RATHER THAN COMING BACK 

21:15:08 FOR ANOTHER ITEM OR MAKING 

21:15:10 SOMETHING FORMAL IF THAT IS THE 

21:15:12 INTEREST OF THE COUNCIL AND I'LL 

21:15:15 DEFER TO KARENA IF WE WANT TO GO 

21:15:17 THERE, WE'D BE HAPPY TO DO THAT 

21:15:19 FOR KIND OF THESE MAJOR ACTIONS 

21:15:20 IF THAT'S WHAT COUNCIL WOULD 

21:15:20 LIKE.

21:15:22 IT'S NOT BEEN THE PRACTICE WE'VE 

21:15:24 HAD.

21:15:26 WE'VE KIND OF -- AND FROM THE 

21:15:28 OTHER PERSPECTIVE IS THE WAY THE 

21:15:29 MOBILITY COMMISSION WAS 

21:15:30 STRUCTURED AND HOW WE USE THEM 

21:15:32 IS THAT THERE'S TWO PEOPLE THAT 

21:15:34 REPRESENT FOLKS THAT WALK, FOLKS 

21:15:38 THAT BIKE, TWO PEOPLE THAT DRIVE 

21:15:41 THAT USE TRANSIT, AND THEN ONE 

21:15:43 REPRESENTATIVE THAT REPRESENTS 

21:15:44 PEOPLE, PERSONS WITH 

21:15:46 DISABILITIES.

21:15:48 AND WE GENERALLY USE THEM AS A 

21:15:50 SOUNDING BOARD BECAUSE WE'RE 

21:15:51 INTERESTED IN COMPLETE STREETS 

21:15:53 AND MULTIMODAL TRANSPORTATION 

21:15:55 AND PROJECTS THAT ADDRESSES ALL 

21:15:57 THE DIFFERENT WAYS THAT PEOPLE 

21:15:59 TRAVEL IN FREMONT.

21:16:04 AND SO IN A WAY WE VALUE THEIR 

21:16:05 INDEPENDENT PERSPECTIVES THAT 

21:16:08 THEY PROVIDE AND NOT NECESSARILY 

21:16:13 FORCE THEM AS A CLIFL BODY TO 

21:16:16  COLLECTIVELY 

21:16:18 BODY TO VOTE ON SOMETHING.

21:16:19 YOU MIGHT HAVE THE BICYCLE 

21:16:22 PEDESTRIAN FOLKS VOTE THIS WAY 

21:16:24 AND YOU MIGHT HAVE THE DRIVING 

21:16:25 REPRESENTATIVES VOTE ANOTHER 

21:16:26 WAY.

21:16:27 WE'VE GENERAL NOT, YOU KNOW, 

21:16:29 KIND OF PUT THEM IN THAT 

21:16:30 SITUATION.

21:16:32 BUT IF THIS IS A FORUM THAT 

21:16:35 COUNCIL WOULD LIKE US TO USE, TO 

21:16:40 TRY TO GET A VOTE IN TERMS OF A 

21:16:42 BALANCE WE'RE HAPPY TO, YOU 

21:16:44 KNOW, SUPPORT THE WISHES OF THE 

21:16:45 COUNCIL ON THIS TOPIC.

21:16:47 AND AGAIN I HOPE IT IS A MAJOR 

21:16:51 ITEM.

21:16:52 >> Karena Shackelford:   I THINK 

21:16:54 WE WOULD NEED TO BE CAREFUL IN 

21:16:55 CALLING IT A VOTE BECAUSE THAT 

21:16:57 IS NOT HOW THE MOBILITY 

21:16:58 COMMISSION IS CURRENTLY SET UP 

21:17:00 AS YOU JUST DESCRIBED NOR IS THE 

21:17:01 SENIOR COMMISSION.

21:17:05 SO IT WOULD REALLY BE CHANGING 

21:17:07 THE WAY, DID CHARGE OF EACH OF 

21:17:09 THOSE COMMISSIONS AND WHAT THE 

21:17:10 EXPECTATION OF THEM IS.

21:17:12 I MEAN YOU COULD CALL IT A 

21:17:14 SURVEY OF THOSE COMMISSIONS OR 

21:17:15 SOMETHING LIKE THAT BUT IF 

21:17:17 YOU'RE ASKING, YOU KNOW, FOR A 

21:17:20 FORMAL VOTE THAT, YOU KNOW, 

21:17:21 WE'RE BRINGING BACK TO THE 

21:17:23 COUNCIL I THINK WE HAVE TO BE 

21:17:25 CAREFUL WITH THAT IN TERMS OF 

21:17:27 THE CURRENTLY CHARGE OF THOSE 

21:17:30 COMMISSIONS.

21:17:32 >> AND THROUGH THE MAYOR IF I 

21:17:34 MAY --

21:17:34 >> Councilmember Kassan:   

21:17:36 CHANGE THE WORDING TO A STRAW 

21:17:39 POM OR SURVEY IN MY MOTION.

21:17:40 >> Councilmember Jones:   BASED 

21:17:43 ON THE COMMENTS FROM BOTH 

21:17:46 MS. SHASMED AND MR. LARSON, IT 

21:17:47 SOUNDS LIKE THE STAFF IS 

21:17:49 PROVIDING ALL OF THIS 

21:17:51 OPPORTUNITY FOR INPUT AS IT IS.

21:17:53 AND YOU KNOW, MR. LARSON, 

21:17:54 PARTICULARLY IN SOME OF THESE 

21:17:58 LARGER PRODUCTS, OR THESE 

21:18:01 PROJECTS IT'S NOT LIKE THEY ARE 

21:18:02 LAST MINUTE KINDS EVER THINGS.

21:18:04 THEY'RE SIX MONTHS A YEAR IN THE 

21:18:05 WORKS AND THESE COMMISSIONS DO 

21:18:09 HAVE THE ABILITY TO REVIEW THEM 

21:18:10 IF YOU WILL AND KIND OF WEIGH IN 

21:18:12 ON WHATEVER THEIR OPINION IS.

21:18:14 AND I'M SURE THEY RELAY THAT TO 

21:18:16 YOU AND THAT IN TURN IS RELAYED 

21:18:17 TO US.

21:18:19 SO IN THAT CASE I WOULD NOT BE 

21:18:21 SUPPORTIVE OF BRINGING THIS AS 

21:18:22 AN ACTUAL RESOLUTION.

21:18:23 I THINK THAT -- I DON'T THINK 

21:18:25 THAT WE NEED TO OVERLOAD OUR 

21:18:27 STAFF WITH ANY MORE WORK THAN 

21:18:28 THEY'RE ALREADY DOING AND I 

21:18:30 THINK THAT THE INPUT THAT 

21:18:32 THEY'RE GETTING FROM THESE 

21:18:34 VARIOUS COMMISSIONS ON A REGULAR 

21:18:36 BASIS ON PROJECTS THAT AFFECT 

21:18:37 PARTICULAR GROUPS IS GOING TO BE 

21:18:39 SUFFICIENT.

21:18:40 >> AND THROUGH THE MAYOR JUST SO 

21:18:42 I CAN SEPARATE PROCESSES BECAUSE 

21:18:43 I DO THINK THAT WE'VE KIND OF 

21:18:46 CREATED TWO DIFFERENT PATHS, ONE 

21:18:49 IS, YOU KNOW, CITY MANAGER 

21:18:51 SHACKELFORD HAS THE OPERATIONAL 

21:18:52 AUTHORITY ALREADY TO HAVE HER 

21:18:53 STAFF PRESENT TO THESE 

21:18:54 COMMISSIONS.

21:18:56 SHE DOESN'T NEED DIRECTION TO DO 

21:18:58 THAT, SHE CAN CERTAINLY DO THAT 

21:19:00 BASED ON THE CONSENSUS OF THE 

21:19:00 COUNCIL.

21:19:02 IF WHAT IS DESIRED IS TO CREATE 

21:19:03 A POLICY THAT REQUIRES VOTES, 

21:19:04 THAT WAS THE REASON THAT I 

21:19:06 SUGGESTED IT WOULD HAVE TO COME 

21:19:08 BACK BECAUSE WE'D HAVE TO CRAFT 

21:19:10 THAT POLICY AND THAT LEGISLATION 

21:19:13 IN ORDER TO EFFECTUATE THAT NEW 

21:19:14 REQUIREMENT OF THE COMMISSION.

21:19:17 SO IF IT'S MORE A CONSENSUS THAT 

21:19:20 STAFF SHOULD, AS PART OF ITS 

21:19:22 OPERATIONS PRESENT TO THOSE 

21:19:24 BODIES, PROBABLY WE DON'T NEED A 

21:19:27 RESOLUTION OR LEGISLATION THAT 

21:19:28 TONIGHT'S DIRECTION IS PROBABLY 

21:19:29 SUFFICIENT.

21:19:30 BUT IF SOMETHING GREATER IS 

21:19:32 REQUIRED, POLICY MAKING AND A 

21:19:34 REQUIREMENT OF VOTE TAKING THEN 

21:19:35 WE PROBABLY WOULD HAVE TO COME 

21:19:35 BACK.

21:19:37 SO JUST THAT CLARITY ON THAT 

21:19:38 POINT CERTAINLY WOULD HELP.

21:19:40 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

21:19:40 >> Councilmember Kassan:   CAN I 

21:19:44 JUMP IN SINCE IT'S MY MOTION?

21:19:45 I THINK IT'S SOMEWHERE IN 

21:19:46 BETWEEN.

21:19:47 I DEFINITELY WOULD NOT BE 

21:19:49 CALLING FOR THE REQUIREMENT OF A 

21:19:51 VOTE BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND THAT'S 

21:19:52 NOT WHAT THE COMMISSIONS DO.

21:19:54 BUT I DEFINITELY DON'T AGREE 

21:19:56 WITH WHAT COUNCILMEMBER JONES IS 

21:19:58 SAYING IS OH JUST KEEP DOING 

21:20:00 WHAT YOU'RE ALREADY DOING SHARE 

21:20:01 THE INFORMATION SEE IF THEY 

21:20:03 MIGHT GIVE FEEDBACK OR NOT.

21:20:06 WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IS, THE 

21:20:09 STAFF MAKING ITS BEST EFFORT TO 

21:20:11 SOLICIT FEEDBACK FROM THESE 

21:20:13 COMMISSIONS AND TAKE A STRAW 

21:20:16 POLL TO DETERMINE THEIR LEVEL OF 

21:20:22 SUPPORT.

21:20:25 >> Mayor Mei:   I ALSO SEE 

21:20:27 COUNCILMEMBER SHAO WHO HAD A 

21:20:28 COMMENT WITH THAT.

21:20:29 >> Councilmember Kassan:   SORRY 

21:20:30 ABOUT THAT, I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S 

21:20:33 WRONG WITH MY INTERNET AND HAVE 

21:20:34 MINUTES TAKEN OF THESE MEETINGS 

21:20:37 SO THAT WE CAN GET THE FORMAL 

21:20:39 INPUT OF THESE BODIES ON THESE 

21:20:40 MAJOR PROJECTS.

21:20:42 THAT IS WHAT MY MOTION IS.

21:20:43 WHETHER THE STAFF MIGHT WANT TO 

21:20:46 SAY, THAT'S FINE WE CAN DO THAT 

21:20:48 OR IF THIS REQUIRES A FORMAL 

21:20:52 VOTE, EITHER WAY IS FINE WITH 

21:20:56 ME.

21:20:56 >> Councilmember Shao:   THANK 

21:20:58 YOU, MADAM MAYOR.

21:21:01 THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME THE 

21:21:02 PLOOR FLOOR.

21:21:06  

21:21:06 FLOOR.

21:21:09 I REALIZE THIS IS AN INFORMATION 

21:21:12 ONLY ITEM, AND ANY ACTION 

21:21:17 RESIDING FROM THE ITEM IS A 

21:21:24 PROBLEM STARS POINT OF ORDER.

21:21:26 HOWEVER, A MOTION FROM THIS ITEM 

21:21:28 IS CERTAINLY NOT WHAT I EXPECTED 

21:21:30 FOR THE PURPOSE OF THE POINT OF 

21:21:33 ORDER, I'M GOING TO VETO IT.

21:21:35 IF WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A VOTE.

21:21:37 HOWEVER, YOU KNOW, THAT 

21:21:42 BASICALLY SETS UP A PRECEDENT 

21:21:45 WHERE A REFERRAL CAN COME OUT OF 

21:21:47 A INFORMATION AGENDA RIGHT ON 

21:21:54 THE SPOT AND GET VOTED ON.

21:21:56 IF COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN THINKS 

21:21:58 THIS IS THE ISSUE THAT WOULD 

21:22:01 REALLY BE SO SIGNIFICANT I WOULD 

21:22:04 EXPECT HER TO MAKE A REFERRAL 

21:22:05 AFTER THIS MEETING.

21:22:07 AND THEN GO THROUGH THE PROCESS 

21:22:10 AND THEN WE CAN ENGAGE IN --

21:22:11 >> Councilmember Kassan:   I 

21:22:14 DID, I DID MAKE A REFERRAL.

21:22:15 >> Councilmember Shao:   TODAY?

21:22:17 >> Councilmember Kassan:   NO, A 

21:22:19 FEW WEEKS AGO.

21:22:20 >> Councilmember Shao:   BUT IT 

21:22:22 WAS NOT ON THE AGENDA.

21:22:22 >> Councilmember Kassan:   IT 

21:22:24 WAS CHOSEN NOT TO MAKE IT A 

21:22:26 REFERRAL ON THE AGENDA.

21:22:30 >> Mayor Mei:   OKAY.

21:22:31 >> GO AHEAD I'M SORRY.

21:22:32 >> Councilmember Shao:   SO FOR 

21:22:34 THAT I THINK FROM WHAT I CAN 

21:22:36 TELL, IT'S JUST A FURTHER 

21:22:39 COMMUNICATION BETWEEN 

21:22:40 COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN WITH 

21:22:44 PROBABLY DIRECTOR LARSON AND 

21:22:45 CITY COUNCIL -- AND THE CITY 

21:22:48 MANAGER OFFLINE.

21:22:50 BUT I WOULD CAUTION THAT AS THE 

21:22:53 CITY COUNCIL WE DON'T 

21:22:54 MICROMANAGEMENT.

21:22:58 WE DON'T MICROMANAGE AND WE CAN 

21:23:00 CERTAINLY GIVE A GENERAL 

21:23:02 DIRECTION, NOT INTO THE DETAILS, 

21:23:05 AS TO HOW THIS HAS TO BE DONE IN 

21:23:08 A SPECIFIC WAY.

21:23:11 AND NEEDLESS TO SAY THAT ANY 

21:23:13 VOTING SHOULD HAVE A FORMAL 

21:23:16 REFERRAL RIGHT ON THE AGENDA.

21:23:20 SO I DECLINE TO VOTE GIST 

21:23:23  JUST 

21:23:25 BECAUSE THIS IS TO MY 

21:23:28 UNDERSTANDING PROBLEMATIC AS FAR 

21:23:30 AS POINT OF ORDER.

21:23:33 >> Mayor Mei:   OKAY, VICE MAYOR 

21:23:34 SALWAN.

21:23:35 >> Councilmember Salwan:   DOES 

21:23:37 MS. SHACKELFORD HAVE SOMETHING?

21:23:38 >> Karena Shackelford:   I WAS 

21:23:39 JUST GOING TO SAY HEARING ALL 

21:23:42 THE DISCUSSION I'M HAPPY TO GO 

21:23:44 BACK AND HAVE A DISCUSSION WITH 

21:23:45 STAFF JUST TO CONFIRM WHAT IS 

21:23:46 CURRENTLY BEING DONE AND 

21:23:48 IDENTIFY SOME WAYS THAT WE CAN 

21:23:52 ENHANCE THE COMMUNICATION WITH 

21:23:53 THESE COMMISSIONS.

21:23:57 SO, YOU KNOW, AS CITY ATTORNEY 

21:23:59 ALVARADO HAS STATED 

21:24:01 OPERATIONALLY, WE ARE ALWAYS 

21:24:03 LOOKING FOR WAYS TO MAKE 

21:24:04 IMPROVEMENTS SO WE'RE HAPPY TO 

21:24:06 HAVE THAT CONVERSATION AND SEE 

21:24:07 WHAT WE CAN DO TO MAKE SURE 

21:24:10 WE'RE GETTING AS MUCH FEEDBACK 

21:24:11 AS WE CAN FROM THE APPROPRIATE 

21:24:14 PARTIES.

21:24:15 >> Mayor Mei:   I JUST WANTED TO 

21:24:18 MAKE A GENERAL COMMENT, BECAUSE 

21:24:20 I'M LOOKING AT THE COMMISSION'S 

21:24:22 PAGE AS WELL AS THE PAST MINUTES 

21:24:23 AND SUCH.

21:24:26 AND I SEE THAT ON THERE WE HAVE 

21:24:28 STAFF UPDATES AND WE DO HAVE 

21:24:29 MINUTES BUT IT DOESN'T GO INTO 

21:24:31 THE GREAT DETAIL THAT WE SEE ON 

21:24:32 SOME OF THE OTHER MINUTES AND 

21:24:34 PERHAPS THAT'S SOMETHING WE CAN 

21:24:35 ENHANCE THERE TO MAKE IT 

21:24:36 SATISFIED.

21:24:37 I THINK WHAT COUNCILMEMBER 

21:24:39 KASSAN IS ASKING FOR IS IF WE 

21:24:40 DOCUMENT LIKE THE PRESENTATIONS 

21:24:43 LIKE THE MOST RECENT ONE WE HAD, 

21:24:46 IT HAD SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF 

21:24:47 UPDATES FOR THE WORKING BALANCE 

21:24:49 FOR THE YEAR FOR 2022.

21:24:51 IT HAD DIFFERENT PROJECTS THAT 

21:24:54 WERE BEING EMPHASIZED AND IT HAD 

21:24:56 SOME COMMENTS FROM THE MEMBERS.

21:24:59 BUT IT DIDN'T NECESSARILY 

21:25:00 COMMENT AND I WILL DISAGREE WITH 

21:25:03 I THINK VICE MAYOR SALWAN THAT 

21:25:05 MAY HAVE MENTIONED IT EARLIER IN 

21:25:08 THE PAST WHEN WE'VE HAD AGENDA 

21:25:10 ITEMS COMING UP WE WOULD HAVE 

21:25:11 HAD MEMBER REPRESENTATIVE THE 

21:25:13 CHAIR OF THE COMMISSION OR OTHER 

21:25:16 AREAS COME AND SPEAK ON THESE 

21:25:18 ITEMS AS A REPRESENTATIVE FOR 

21:25:18 THAT.

21:25:20 I DON'T WANT TO TASK ALL THE 

21:25:22 CHAIRS BECAUSE THEN MAYBE PEOPLE 

21:25:23 DON'T WANT TO BE THE CHAIRS OF 

21:25:24 THESE COMMISSIONS.

21:25:27 BUT I DO THINK IT'S VALUABLE IF 

21:25:27 THEY WANT TO PARTICIPATE.

21:25:29 IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THE CHAIR.

21:25:32 WE'VE ALSO HAD OTHER COMMISSION 

21:25:33 MEMBERS THEMSELVES COME AND 

21:25:34 JOIN.

21:25:36 AND CERTAINLY IN A COMMISSION 

21:25:39 ITSELF THEY ARE OFTEN OPPOSING 

21:25:41 VIEWS SO THEY ARE NOT ALWAYS IN 

21:25:42 CONSENSUS ON THAT.

21:25:44 I SEE VICE MAYOR SALWAN IS YOUR 

21:25:45 HAND STILL RAISED?

21:25:46 >> Councilmember Salwan:   YES 

21:25:48 SO I THINK THAT STAFF HAS 

21:25:50 OFFERED A PATH THAT IS MORE THAN 

21:25:52 WHAT HAS BEEN DONE.

21:25:54 AND I THINK COUNCILMEMBER JONES 

21:25:56 ALSO REFERENCED THAT SO HE'S NOT 

21:25:57 DOING JUST THE STATUS QUO.

21:25:59 I THINK HE SAID THAT, YOU KNOW, 

21:26:01 STAFF WOULD DO FURTHER 

21:26:02 ENGAGEMENT AND GET MORE FEEDBACK 

21:26:03 FROM THE COMMISSION.

21:26:07 AND I THINK THAT MS. SHACKELFORD 

21:26:08 OPERATIONALLY CAN HANDLE THIS 

21:26:09 VERY WELL.

21:26:13 I ALSO AGREE WITH DR. SHAO THAT 

21:26:14 PROCEDURALLY, THIS IS AN 

21:26:15 INFORMATION ITEM.

21:26:17 SO I FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE MAKING 

21:26:22 MOTIONS OR, YOU KNOW, MAKING 

21:26:25 DRASTIC CHANGES TO OUR BYLAWS OR 

21:26:27 OUR COMMITTEE SETUPS.

21:26:28 SO THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE ON A 

21:26:30 SEPARATE DAY AND A DIFFERENT 

21:26:31 AGENDA ITEM.

21:26:33 I THINK I FEEL CONFIDENT IN 

21:26:37  

21:26:40 STAFF'S REINSURANCES, WE TRY TO 

21:26:41 ACCOMPLISH WHAT COUNCILMEMBER 

21:26:43 KASSAN IS LOOKING FOR AND TRY TO 

21:26:45 GET MORE ROBUST ENGAGEMENT FROM 

21:26:47 OUR COMMISSIONS.

21:26:48 >> Karena Shackelford:   I DO 

21:26:49 WANT TO CLARIFY THAT THIS ITEM 

21:26:51 WAS BROUGHT TO YOU ALL AS AN 

21:26:54 INFORMATION ITEM IN RESPONSE TO 

21:26:55 INQUIRIES AND RESPONSES THAT 

21:26:58 I'VE HEARD FROM SOME OF YOU BUT 

21:27:00 ALSO INQUIRIES AND COMMENT 

21:27:02 EXCUSE ME THAT WE'VE HEARD FROM 

21:27:03 THE COMMUNITY ABOUT OUR 

21:27:04 COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT EFFORTS 

21:27:07 ABOUT OUR COMMUNITY SURVEYS AND 

21:27:09 WITH THE PASEO PADRE ITEM COMING 

21:27:12 BEFORE YOU NEXT WEEK, WHICH HAS 

21:27:14 BEEN A BIG ITEM OVER THE LAST 

21:27:17 FEW YEARS, I THOUGHT IT BEST TO 

21:27:19 GET THIS INFORMATION OUT THERE 

21:27:21 IN ADVANCE SO THAT PEOPLE CAN 

21:27:22 UNDERSTAND HOW IT IS THAT WE'RE 

21:27:24 USING THE INFORMATION THAT WE'RE 

21:27:25 COLLECTING.

21:27:28 AND JUST TO REITERATE WHAT 

21:27:30 DIRECTOR LARSON SAID, IT'S A 

21:27:32 COMBINATION OF THINGS.

21:27:37 BUT OUR PROFESSIONAL EXPERTISE 

21:27:39 WEIGHS REALLY HEAVILY IN THE 

21:27:40 DECISIONS THAT ARE MADE AND EVEN 

21:27:41 MORE THAN THAT THE POLICY 

21:27:43 DECISIONS THAT YOU ALL HAVE MADE 

21:27:46 WITH REGARD TO PLANS LIKE THE 

21:27:48 MOBILITY ACTION PLAN, VISION 

21:27:50 ZERO AND OTHER POLICIES AS WELL.

21:27:51 SO THERE ARE A NUMBER OF THINGS 

21:27:54 THAT FACTOR INTO THE DECISIONS 

21:27:56 THAT ARE MADE, THE 

21:27:57 RECOMMENDATIONS THAT ARE MADE 

21:27:58 AND WHAT'S BEING PRESENTED TO 

21:28:00 YOU ALL.

21:28:02 I JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY THAT.

21:28:03 THANK YOU.

21:28:04 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

21:28:05 COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN YOU STILL 

21:28:07 HAVE YOUR HAND RAISED.

21:28:09 >> Councilmember Kassan:   YES, 

21:28:11 I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THIS 

21:28:12 PROCESS.

21:28:22 SO WE HAD AT OUR --

21:28:23 >> Mayor Mei:   MY APOLOGIES 

21:28:24 COMN.

21:28:28  

21:28:29 COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN I THINK YOU 

21:28:32 HAD FROZEN, YOU'RE UNFROZEN.

21:28:33 >> Councilmember Kassan:   I'M 

21:28:34 SO SORRY, I DON'T KNOW WHAT 

21:28:35 HAPPENED.

21:28:36 AT OUR COUNCIL RETREAT IT WAS 

21:28:39 STATED THAT IF AN ITEM COMES UP 

21:28:46 DURING PUBLIC COMMENT THAT ONE 

21:28:51 OF US FEEL NEEDS TO BE 

21:28:53 ADDRESSED, WE CAN MAKE THAT 

21:28:53 COMMENT.

21:28:55 I SPOKE RIGHT AFTERWARDS AND SAY 

21:28:59 I WOULD LIKE THIS ITEM TO BE 

21:29:00 AGENDIZED.

21:29:02 I WAS TOLD THAT AWAY NOT PROPER 

21:29:04 AND I SHOULD DO A REFERRAL.

21:29:05 I THEN MADE A REFERRAL ON THIS 

21:29:06 ITEM.

21:29:09 I WAS THEN TOLD WE ARE NOT GOING 

21:29:11 TO TREAT IT AS A REFERRAL, WE 

21:29:12 TREAT IT AS A REPORT.

21:29:14 SO I FEEL VERY FRUSTRATED THAT 

21:29:17 THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR 

21:29:17 WEEKS.

21:29:19 AND I JUST FEEL LIKE WE NEED TO 

21:29:20 MAKE A DECISION.

21:29:22 IN IT HAPPENS AT A FUTURE 

21:29:23 MEETING FINE.

21:29:26 BUT I WOULD LIKE A MORE FORMAL 

21:29:28 PROCESS AS THE ONE I DESCRIBED, 

21:29:30 TO BE VOTED ON BY THE COUNCIL.

21:29:32 I THINK THAT IS AN IMPORTANT 

21:29:34 PROCESS TO HAVE WHEN WE'RE 

21:29:38 MAKING MAJOR DECISIONS ABOUT 

21:29:39 RECONFIGURATIONS OF STREETS.

21:29:41 IF NOBODY AGREES WITH ME, FINE 

21:29:42 VOTE NO.

21:29:45 BUT I DON'T WANT THIS TO BE 

21:29:46 JUST, YOU KNOW, SHOVED UNDER THE 

21:29:48 RUG AND SAY OH WELL STAFF IS 

21:29:50 GOING TO TRY A LITTLE HARDER TO 

21:29:51 GET MORE INPUT FROM THE 

21:29:52 COMMISSIONS.

21:29:53 THAT'S NOT WHAT I THINK NEEDS TO 

21:29:55 HAPPEN IN THESE CASES.

21:29:57 SO WHATEVER THE PROCESS NOW, THE 

21:29:59 THIRD OR FOURTH ITERATION OF 

21:30:01 WHAT THE PROCESS NEEDS TO BE, I 

21:30:02 WOULD LIKE THIS TO BE AGENDIZED 

21:30:04 AND WOULD I LIKE THIS TO BE 

21:30:08  I WOULD LIKE THIS TO BE 

21:30:10 VOTED ON BY THE COUNCIL.

21:30:12 IF THE COUNCIL DOESN'T THINK 

21:30:14 IT'S IMPORTANT TO GET MAJOR 

21:30:16 INPUT FROM THE SENIOR COMMISSION 

21:30:18 OR THE MOBILITY COMMISSION, THEN 

21:30:20 FINE, MAKE THAT A PUBLIC RECORD.

21:30:22 I WANT IT AGENDIZED EITHER RIGHT 

21:30:24 NOW OR AT A FUTURE MEETING AS 

21:30:26 I'VE BEEN ASKING FOR WEEKS.

21:30:31 >> Mayor Mei:   ALL RIGHT, 

21:30:33  

21:30:36 COUNSEL IN TERMS OF EITHER CITY 

21:30:41 MANAGER SHACKELFORD OR --

21:30:41 >> Karena Shackelford:   I THINK 

21:30:44 WHAT WOULD BE BEST IS IF I ASKED 

21:30:45 THE CITY MANAGER TAKE THE 

21:30:48 COMMENTS THAT COUNCILMEMBER 

21:30:49 KASSAN JUST MADE AND ACCEPT THAT 

21:30:52 AS A REFERRAL, FROM HER FOR 

21:30:55 FUTURE AGENDA.

21:30:56 >> Mayor Mei:   OKAY.

21:30:58 SO WHY DON'T WE --

21:31:00 >> Karena Shackelford:   AND SO 

21:31:02 I DON'T THINK I'LL DEFER TO MY 

21:31:04 COLLEAGUE RAFAEL, BUT I DON'T 

21:31:06 THINK THAT THAT NEEDS TO BE 

21:31:07 VOTED ON OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

21:31:09 A COUNCILMEMBER TYPICALLY CAN 

21:31:10 MAKE A REFERRAL.

21:31:12 I USUALLY GET AN E-MAIL REQUEST 

21:31:12 FOR A REFERRAL.

21:31:15 SO BASED ON THE CONVERSATION --

21:31:15 >> Councilmember Kassan:   WHICH 

21:31:18 I DID SEND A LONG TIME AGO.

21:31:19 >> Karena Shackelford:   THAT 

21:31:20 WAS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT WHICH 

21:31:22 IS WHY THE INFORMATIONAL ITEM 

21:31:24 CAME FORWARD, ONE OF THE 

21:31:24 REASONS.

21:31:28 BUT I DON'T THINK IT NEEDS TO BE -- A REFERRAL -- A REQUEST 

21:31:29 FOR A REFERRAL DOESN'T NEED TO 

21:31:31 BE VOTED ON.

21:31:32 >> Mayor Mei:   NO, IT WILL BE 

21:31:34 ONCE YOU PUT IT ON THE AGENDA 

21:31:36 AND THAT WOULD GIVE THE PUBLIC 

21:31:37 OPPORTUNITY FOR INPUT.

21:31:40 BUT I DO THINK THAT, YOU KNOW, 

21:31:44 WE DO HAVE AN UPDATE AN PLANS, I 

21:31:47 JUST SAW THE UPDATED MAN'S AT 

21:31:49 THE LAST AGENDA ITEMS.

21:31:51 THE MARCH 25th COMMISSION, 

21:31:52 HOPEFULLY FROM THAT COMMISSION 

21:31:54 MEETING I DON'T SEE THE MINUTES 

21:31:56 YET FOR THAT BUT IF WE HAVE THE 

21:31:58 MINUTES THAT DETAILED WHAT THE 

21:32:00 PLANS WERE THAT WERE UPDATED AN 

21:32:02  AND 

21:32:04 I KNOW WHETHER IT'S THIS 

21:32:05 COMMISSION OR OTHERS WE DO GET 

21:32:07 NOTICE OF THE AGENDAS AS WELL AS 

21:32:09 THE MINUTES SO HOPEFULLY WE CAN 

21:32:10 INCLUDE THAT MORE.

21:32:12 THANK YOU.

21:32:15 I'M GOING TO CLOSE THIS ITEM AND 

21:32:18 I SEE A HAND RAISED BUT I'M NOT 

21:32:19 SURE IF IT'S FOR THE NEXT ITEM 

21:32:22 WHICH IS THE REFERRAL.

21:32:25 SO THE NEXT ITEM IS ITEM 8A 

21:32:29 WHICH IS THE REFERRAL, REQUEST 

21:32:31 ADOPTION OF RESOLUTION TO UPDATE 

21:32:34 THE COUNCIL AGENDA ASSIGNMENTS.

21:32:35 AND THE ONLY ONE I'M GOING TO 

21:32:37 PULL IS AT THE REQUEST OF ONE OF 

21:32:39 OUR COUNCILMEMBERS, I'M GOING TO 

21:32:41 PULL THE ONE FOR EAST BAY 

21:32:41 COMMUNITY ENERGY BECAUSE WE'RE 

21:32:42 GOING TO HAVE A CONVERSATION 

21:32:47 WITH THEM ON THIS CHANGE 

21:32:48 PROPOSED.

21:32:49 BUT AT THIS TIME, I DON'T KNOW 

21:32:50 IF WE WANTED TO VOTE ON THE 

21:32:51 OTHER PARTS OF IT.

21:32:55 BECAUSE I THINK THERE IS AN 

21:32:57 UPCOMING MEETING AND THEN ALSO, 

21:33:00 WE'LL REVIEW ALSO, I WAS NOTED 

21:33:02 THAT THERE MIGHT BE SOMETHING ON 

21:33:03 SOME OF THE CHARTS.

21:33:04 I THINK THE CHART HAS BEEN THE 

21:33:06 SAME BUT I THINK THERE MAY HAVE 

21:33:08 BEEN SOME LACK OF UPDATES 

21:33:10 WHETHER IT'S FROM THE ENTITIES, 

21:33:12 THE LOCAL AGENCIES TO US IN 

21:33:15 TERMS OF I GUESS THERE WAS A 

21:33:17 QUESTION ABOUT STIPEND OR SOME 

21:33:19 OTHER AREA SO WE'LL TAKE THAT.

21:33:22 BUT IF IT'S NOT URGENT 

21:33:24 MS. GAUTHIER THERE MIGHT BE TIME 

21:33:26 THAT WE CAN BRING IT BACK TO THE 

21:33:26 NEXT MEETING.

21:33:31 >> The Clerk:   WE CAN DO THAT, 

21:33:33 PROVIDE YOUR SUGGESTIONS YOUR 

21:33:35 CHANGES AND I CAN PUT IT ON THE 

21:33:38 NEXT AGENDA.

21:33:39 >> Mayor Mei:   OKAY THANK YOU.

21:33:41 I THINK THAT WILL GIVE US SOME 

21:33:43 TIME TO BE ABLE TO RESPOND TO, 

21:33:45 OF THE INQUIRIES, COUNCILMEMBER 

21:33:46 KASSAN DID YOU HAVE A QUESTION 

21:33:48 ON THAT?

21:33:49 >> Councilmember Kassan:   ARE 

21:33:49 YOU TALKING ABOUT THE 

21:33:50 APPOINTMENTS TO COMMITTEES?

21:33:52 BECAUSE WHEN I READ THE AGENDA 

21:33:54 ITEMS IT DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING 

21:33:56 ABOUT EBCE.

21:33:57 IT JUST SAID --

21:33:58 >> Mayor Mei:   IT WAS ACTUALLY 

21:33:59 FOR ALL THE COMMITTEES.

21:34:00 IT WAS A INFLUENCE COMMITTEE 

21:34:02 THAT WE HAD BEEN ASKED TO MAKE 

21:34:04 AN ASSIGNMENT TO BECAUSE THERE 

21:34:05 WAS NEED FOR REPRESENTATION.

21:34:07 AND I HAVE TO PULL UP THE ONE 

21:34:08 RIGHT NOW.

21:34:11 >> The Clerk:   FOR THE SOUTHERN 

21:34:13 ALAMEDA COUNTY GSJPA WHICH IS 

21:34:15 THE ONE WE ARE MOVING FORWARD OR 

21:34:16 THE MAYOR WANTED TO MOVE FORWARD 

21:34:19 WITH THE APPOINTMENT TO VICE 

21:34:25 MAYOR SALWAN AND THEN I PUT -- I 

21:34:27 REMOVED A LINE ITEM REGARDING 

21:34:30 THE I THINK IT WAS THE SOUTH BAY 

21:34:32 CONNECT CORRIDOR, BECAUSE I HAD 

21:34:33 LEARNED AFTER THE APPOINTMENTS 

21:34:38 WERE MADE THAT AT THE LAST TIME 

21:34:39 THE APPOINTMENTS WERE MADE, THAT 

21:34:41 IT WAS ACTUALLY CITY COUNCIL 

21:34:43 DOES NOT MAKE THE APPOINTMENTS 

21:34:43 TO THAT.

21:34:45 AND SO I WAS JUST DOING CLEANUP 

21:34:47 BUT I SHOULD HAVE NOTED IT IN 

21:34:49 MAYOR'S STAFF REPORT FOR THIS 

21:34:51 EVENING.

21:34:52 THAT THAT LINE ITEM WAS BEING 

21:34:55 REMOVED.

21:34:57 AND COUNCILMEMBER COX SENT AN 

21:34:59 E-MAIL WITH SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT 

21:35:04 EAST BAY, EBCE I THINK IS THE 

21:35:05 ACRONYM EARLIER TODAY WHICH WE 

21:35:07 HAVE NOT ADDRESSED.

21:35:10 >> Mayor Mei:   RIGHT WHICH WE 

21:35:12 WILL CLARIFY WITH EAST BAY 

21:35:13 COMMUNITY ENERGY.

21:35:15 COUNCILMEMBER COX YOU HAVE YOUR 

21:35:16 HAND RAISED.

21:35:17 >> Councilmember Cox:   YES, 

21:35:18 THANK YOU FOR RECOGNIZING ME.

21:35:20 I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN 

21:35:21 YOU SUBMIT THE CHANGES THAT YOU 

21:35:23 HIGHLIGHT IN YELLOW WHAT WAS 

21:35:24 CHANGED FROM TODAY'S VERSION TO 

21:35:26 THE ONE THAT'S GOING TO BE 

21:35:26 PRESENTED.

21:35:28 SO THAT IT'S CLEAR WITH EVERYONE 

21:35:31 WHAT WERE THE CHANGES MADE ON 

21:35:33 THE DOCUMENT.

21:35:34 AND JUST MAKING SURE THAT 

21:35:36 EVERYBODY IS ALIGNED AND ANY 

21:35:38 OTHER CHANGES THAT AS WE'RE 

21:35:40 MAKING AN UPDATE THAT EVERYBODY 

21:35:42 ELSE HAS TAKEN LOOK AT THIS 

21:35:43 ASSIGNMENT LIST TO MAKE SURE 

21:35:45 NOTHING ELSE HAS CHANGED.

21:35:47 HAVE YOU VALIDATED THAT, MAYOR 

21:35:49 MEI WITH EVERYONE?

21:35:50 THAT'S LISTED?

21:35:52 BECAUSE I SAW THE LIST WAS DATED 

21:35:55 BACK ON MARCH 9th OF 2021.

21:35:57 AND THIS IS A NEW VERSION A YEAR 

21:35:58 LATER.

21:36:00 AND JUST MAKING SURE EVERYBODY'S 

21:36:01 COMFORTABLE WITH THEIR 

21:36:03 ASSIGNMENTS AND EVERYTHING.

21:36:04 >> Mayor Mei:   WELL, USUALLY 

21:36:05 THE ASSIGNMENTS IN PAST PRACTICE 

21:36:07 HAVE BEEN FOR TWO YEARS AND SO 

21:36:09 THAT HAS BEEN THE PAST PRACTICE.

21:36:10 THE REASON WHY I THINK THIS 

21:36:12 CHART WAS ADDED THIS TIME IS 

21:36:14 BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT WE'RE 

21:36:16 ADDING A DIFFERENT ROLE WHICH 

21:36:19 WAS NOT ON THE CHART PREVIOUSLY.

21:36:20 THIS IS A GOOD TIME AS WE GO 

21:36:22 THROUGH THIS TO LOOK THROUGH ALL 

21:36:23 THE DIFFERENT LINE ITEMS.

21:36:24 BECAUSE SOME OF THE COMMITTEES 

21:36:26 HAVE MET LIKE FOR EXAMPLE IN THE 

21:36:28 PAST MORE OFTEN, THE BART AND 

21:36:30 THEN NO LONGER ARE MEETING AND 

21:36:32 OTHER THINGS SO WE CAN LOOK AT 

21:36:34 REFRESHING THOSE AS WELL AS 

21:36:36 CONFIRMING WITH THE AGENCIES ANY 

21:36:36 OF THE DIFFERENT CHANGES THAT 

21:36:38 HAVE HAPPENED.

21:36:39 COUNCILMEMBER JONES DO YOU 

21:36:39 HAVE --

21:36:39 >> Councilmember Cox:   I JUST 

21:36:41 WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DOUBLE 

21:36:42 CHECK ALL THE INFORMATION 

21:36:44 BECAUSE THERE WAS SOME MISSING 

21:36:46 INFORMATION FOR THE EAST BAY 

21:36:48 COMMUNITY ENERGY.

21:36:50 WHERE THERE WAS THE MEETING, THE 

21:36:52 STIPEND, I THINK WE SHOULD MAKE 

21:36:54 SURE THAT IT IS TOTALLY 

21:36:55 COMPLETE, ACCURATE AND 

21:36:57 TRANSPARENT TO THE PUBLIC.

21:36:58 AND IF THERE'S ANY CHANGES FROM 

21:37:01 TODAY, ON TO WHEN IT'S RELEASED 

21:37:03 AGAIN AT THE NEXT MEETING OR 

21:37:05 NEXT MONTH, THAT WE HAVE THAT 

21:37:06 HIGHLIGHTED IN YELLOW.

21:37:08 SO I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE 

21:37:10 THAT'S CLEAR WITH EVERYONE, IF 

21:37:11 THAT CAN BE POSSIBLE.

21:37:11 THANK YOU.

21:37:12 >> Mayor Mei:   I DON'T SEE ANY 

21:37:14 REASON WHY WE COULDN'T NOTE ANY 

21:37:16 AMENDMENTS OR CHANGES.

21:37:17 COUNCILMEMBER JONES.

21:37:17 >> Councilmember Jones:   MADAM 

21:37:19 MAYOR, QUICK QUESTION.

21:37:21 SO ARE WE REMOVING THIS ITEM 

21:37:23 COMPLETELY OR DID YOU WANT A 

21:37:25 MOTION TO GO FORWARD WITH 

21:37:27 APPOINTING VICE MAYOR SALWAN?

21:37:29 >> Mayor Mei:   I THINK THAT WE 

21:37:30 HAVE TIME.

21:37:31 I THINK THE FIRST MEETING FOR 

21:37:33 THAT JOINT POWER IS GOING TO BE 

21:37:34 MAY, I THINK IT'S ACTUALLY THE 

21:37:36 END OF MAY, I LOOKED AT THE PAST 

21:37:37 BECAUSE I LOOKED AT THE MINUTES 

21:37:39 AND ALSO THE NUMBER OF MEETINGS 

21:37:41 AND I THINK IT'S AT THE END OF 

21:37:42 MAY.

21:37:43 BUT I THINK NEXT MEETING SHOULD 

21:37:47 GIVE US SUFFICIENT TIME FOR VICE 

21:37:49 MAYOR SALWAN TO ON-BOARD IF HE 

21:37:52 CAN LOOK AT THE PAST MINUTES AND 

21:37:55 IT'S ONCE A YEAR THAT IT MEETS.

21:37:55 >> Councilmember Jones:   OKAY, 

21:37:56 THANK YOU.

21:37:57 >> Mayor Mei:   SO WITH THAT 

21:38:00 SAID, I WAS GOING TO PULL THAT 

21:38:00 ITEM.

21:38:02 AND ARE THERE ANY ORAL REPORTS?

21:38:04 I THINK WE WERE GOING TO CHANGE 

21:38:06 THIS ALSO THE TITLE FROM ORAL 

21:38:07 REPORTS ON MEETINGS AND EVENTS 

21:38:10 AND THIS IS THE TIME FOR REPORTS 

21:38:12 ON COMMISSIONS THAT PEOPLE ARE 

21:38:14 ON.

21:38:22 OKAY WE'LL START WITH 

21:38:24 COUNCILMEMBER COX FOR COMMISSION 

21:38:24 MEETINGS.

21:38:25 >> Councilmember Cox:   THANK 

21:38:26 YOU.

21:38:29 AS YOU KNOW I SIT ON THE EAST 

21:38:32 BAY COMMUNITY ENERGY BOARD OF 

21:38:34 DIRECTORS, AND I JUST WANTED TO 

21:38:37 REPORT OUT ON SOME OF THE 

21:38:38 INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS AND 

21:38:40 INFORMATION THAT'S HAPPENING.

21:38:43 RIGHT NOW, EAST BAY COMMUNITY 

21:38:46 ENERGY IS DEVELOPING NEW MODELS 

21:38:48 TO PROVIDE CLEAN ENERGY SERVICES 

21:38:51 TO THEIR CUSTOMERS.

21:38:53 AND THEY'RE DELIVERING IT 

21:38:54 THROUGH DIFFERENT CLIMATE ACTION 

21:38:59 PLANS SUCH AS SOLAR, STORAGE FOR 

21:39:02 MUNICIPAL FACILITIES, ANY FAST 

21:39:05 CHARGING FOR ELECTRICAL 

21:39:07 VEHICLES, AND ALSO, THE FLEET 

21:39:10 VEHICLE CHARGING STATIONS AS A 

21:39:12 SERVICE.

21:39:14 AND THEY'RE ALSO TRYING TO HELP 

21:39:17 THE FRONT LINE COMMUNITIES WITH 

21:39:20 DEBT RELIEF AND SAVINGS ON THE 

21:39:20 BILLS.

21:39:22 SO THEY'RE TRYING TO ANALYZE AND 

21:39:24 HELP EVERY SINGLE CUSTOMER 

21:39:26 DURING THIS TIME.

21:39:28 THEY'RE ALSO -- THEY NOTED 

21:39:31 THERE'S SOME OTHER LOCAL CURB 

21:39:32 RAMPS THAT THEY ARE PUTTING SOME 

21:39:37 OF THE PUBLIC DOLLARS IN FOR 

21:39:38 INCENTIVES TO HELP FUND 

21:39:40 CUSTOMERS AND DIFFERENT TYPES OF 

21:39:41 CUSTOMER INVESTMENTS SO THAT 

21:39:45 THEY CAN BE ABLE TO CREATE HIGH 

21:39:49 JOB, HIGH ROAD JOBS, AND 

21:39:51 REQUIRING PREVAILING WAGES AND 

21:39:53 COLLABORATE WITH LOCAL JOB 

21:39:55 TRAINING ORGANIZATIONS, AND THEY 

21:39:58 ALSO HAVE A FOCUS ON EQUITY.

21:40:00 WHICH THEY'RE LOOKING AT AN 

21:40:02 EQUITABLE PROGRAM THAT'S LIKE 

21:40:04 THEIR PORTFOLIO PROGRAMS.

21:40:06 AND THEY'RE TARGETING FRONT LINE 

21:40:12 COMMUNITIES AS LOW INCOME, 

21:40:14 ELECTRIFICATION AND EFFICIENCY 

21:40:15 PROGRAMS AND EVEN THE FAST 

21:40:16 CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE THAT 

21:40:18 TAKES A LOT OF MONEY AND 

21:40:19 INVESTMENT.

21:40:21 SO THEY'RE LOOKING AT HOW TO 

21:40:23 HELP PUT THOSE IN AREAS THAT ARE 

21:40:24 UNDERSERVED THAT NEED IT.

21:40:27 AND ALSO, HELPING OUT THOSE THAT 

21:40:31 WOULD LIKE TO HAVE SOLAR, OR 

21:40:33 SOLAR OR STORAGE, ON THEIR 

21:40:35 PROPERTIES AND HOW THEY CAN 

21:40:36 FIGURE OUT A WAY ESPECIALLY IN 

21:40:38 THE UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES.

21:40:41 SO I REALLY APPLAUD EAST BAY 

21:40:42 COMMUNITY ENERGY FOR A LOT OF 

21:40:45 THEIR WORK THAT THEY'RE TRYING 

21:40:49 TO BASICALLY CLOSE THE GAPS ON 

21:40:50 SOME OF THE INEQUITIES THAT ARE 

21:40:52 IN OUR COMMUNITY.

21:40:54 SO THEY'RE DOING A LOT OF LOCAL 

21:40:55 DEVELOPMENT AND WE'LL LOOK 

21:40:57 FORWARD TO REPORTING OUT ON THE 

21:40:58 PROGRESS.

21:41:00 THANK YOU.

21:41:01 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

21:41:03 NEXT IS COUNCILMEMBER SHAO.

21:41:04 >> Councilmember Shao:   THANK 

21:41:06 YOU, MADAM MAYOR.

21:41:09 HOUSING AUTHORITY OF COUNTY OF 

21:41:11 ALAMEDA WILL HAVE A MONTHLY 

21:41:14 MEETING TOMORROW MORNING AND I 

21:41:17 WILL MAKE A REPORT ACCORDINGLY 

21:41:20 IN OUR NEXT MEETING.

21:41:21 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

21:41:22 COUNCILMEMBER KENG.

21:41:23 >> Councilmember Keng:   YES, 

21:41:26 MADAM MAYOR.

21:41:28 I WILL MAKE A QUICK REPORT-OUT 

21:41:30 AS I HAD THE PLEASURE TO SIT ON 

21:41:32 THE ALAMEDA COUNTY LIBRARY 

21:41:33 COMMISSION.

21:41:37 AND RECENTLY, WE HAD SEEN THE 

21:41:40 NEW LIBRARY FINISHING THEIR 

21:41:42 CONSTRUCTION AT THE CITY OF 

21:41:42 NEWARK.

21:41:46 AND THIS LAST FRIDAY THEY HAD A 

21:41:48 DONOR APPRECIATION RECEPTION AND 

21:41:53 A TOUR OF ALL THE FACILITIES WAS 

21:41:53 GIVEN.

21:41:55 SO IT'S A VERY BEAUTIFUL 

21:41:56 FACILITY IF YOU GUYS HAVEN'T 

21:41:57 BEEN THERE.

21:41:59 THANK YOU.

21:42:00 >> Mayor Mei:   I THINK THAT'S 

21:42:02 GREAT THAT WE'RE SEEING SOME OF 

21:42:03 THE INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS GO 

21:42:06 UP IN OUR NEIGHBORHOODS TOO.

21:42:11 I JUST WANTED TO SHARE THAT 

21:42:12 ALAMEDA COUNTY TRANSPORTATION 

21:42:13 COMMISSION, I THINK THERE WAS A 

21:42:15 LOT OF INTEREST FROM OUR 

21:42:17 COUNCIL, AND I SIT ON THE 

21:42:19 PROJECT AND PLANNING 

21:42:20 LEGISLATIVE, AND I'M HAPPY TO 

21:42:22 SEND A LINK TO THE REGULAR 

21:42:25 UPDATES THAT WE HAVE AND ON A 

21:42:27 MONTHLY BASIS WE DO GET 

21:42:28 LEGISLATIVE UPDATES IN TERMS OF 

21:42:31 FEDERAL AND STATE POLICIES THAT 

21:42:36 WE ARE ABLE TO LOBBY AND GARNER 

21:42:38 SUPPORT FOR WHETHER IT'S WITH 

21:42:39 OUR LEGISLATORS AND I KNOW WE 

21:42:41 ARE EARMARKING PROJECTS AGAIN 

21:42:46 WITH OUR CONGRESS MEMBERS 

21:42:53 SWALLWELL AND KHANA AND IT'S AN 

21:42:54 EXCELLENT MOMENT WITH THE BUILD 

21:42:55 BACK BETTER AND A LOT OF THE 

21:42:56 INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS THAT ARE
