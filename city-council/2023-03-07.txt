I'M HERE TO SPEAK

[Captioner] 19:07:54
 BRIEFLY ABOUT URBAN
FOREST FRIENDS, WHICH IS

[Captioner] 19:07:57
 A TREE ADVOCACY
GROUP,

[Captioner] 19:08:00
 NON-PROFIT, OF WHICH I'M A
MEMBER.
WE ALL WANT A BEAUTIFUL AND

[Captioner] 19:08:04
 SAFE CITY,
AND

[Captioner] 19:08:07
 THAT IS A MAJOR PART OF THE PURPOSE
OF OUR ORGANIZATION,

[Captioner] 19:08:10
 TO PLANT TREES AND
TO MAKE THIS A HEALTHY PLACE.


[Captioner] 19:08:13
WE'RE PROUD TO HAVE MEMBERS WHO ARE
CERTIFIED

[Captioner] 19:08:17
 URBAN COMMUNITY FORESTERS
TRAINED BY

[Captioner] 19:08:20
 THE CANOPY OF PALO ALTO.
WHAT WE

[Captioner] 19:08:23
 DO.
URBAN FOREST FRIENDS TEACHES THE MANY
BENEFITS OF

[Captioner] 19:08:26
 TREES THROUGH PUBLIC
SPEAKING

[Captioner] 19:08:30
 ENGAGEMENTS AND EVENT SUCH AS
ERT DAY.
WE SOLICIT NEIGHBORHOOD

[Captioner] 19:08:34
 HOMEOWNERS TO
STEWARD APPROVED STREET

[Captioner] 19:08:38
 TREES PLANTED
BY OUR VOLUNTEERS.
URBAN

[Captioner] 19:08:41
 FOREST FRIENDS HAS TEAMED UP WITH
OTHER NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS

[Captioner] 19:08:44
 TO PLANT
TREES AT

[Captioner] 19:08:47
 SABERCAT CREEK, STIVERS

[Captioner] 19:08:50
 LAGOON,
OLD MISSION PARK AND FREMONT SCHOOLS AND


[Captioner] 19:08:53
NEIGHBORHOODS.
WE PROVIDE THE ORGANIZATION,

[Captioner] 19:08:57

SUPERVISION, AND EQUIPMENT FOR TREE
PLANTING BY BUSINESS AND

[Captioner] 19:09:01
 NON-PROFIT
ORGANIZATION VOLUNTEERS.


[Captioner] 19:09:04
URBAN FOREST FRIENDS DID THE PLANTING IN
THE PARK MEADOW

[Captioner] 19:09:07
 AREA AS PART OF THE
CITY'S CAL FIRE GRANT.


[Captioner] 19:09:10
OUR TRAINED VOLUNTEERS CONTRIBUTED
HUNDREDS OF

[Captioner] 19:09:14
 HOURS, CANVASSING HOMES,
ASSISTING HOMEOWNERS TO SELECT

[Captioner] 19:09:17

APPROPRIATE TREES, AND EVERYTHING
NECESSARY FOR PLANTING

[Captioner] 19:09:21
 TREES AND THE
FOLLOW-UP CARE.


[Captioner] 19:09:24
URBAN FOREST FRIENDS HAS ALSO DONATED

[Captioner] 19:09:27
 75
CLIMATE RESILIENT OAKS, OAK

[Captioner] 19:09:31
 TREES, AND
WILL PLANT THEM THIS MONTH WITH TRAINED


[Captioner] 19:09:34
COMMUNITY VOLUNTEERS.
URBAN

[Captioner] 19:09:37
 FOREST FRIENDS HAS BEEN HAPPY TO
HELP WITH THE CAL FIRE GRANT.


[Captioner] 19:09:40
WE ARE EXCITED TO CONTRIBUTE OUR
KNOWLEDGE AND

[Captioner] 19:09:43
 IDEAS.
UNFORTUNATELY, DESPITE

[Captioner] 19:09:47
 THE PLANET GEO
CONSULTANT FIRM INCLUDING A CITIZEN

[Captioner] 19:09:49

URBAN FORESTER IN THE WORKING GROUP,
THIS HAS NOT HAPPENED.


[Captioner] 19:09:54
THE RESULT, UNFORTUNATELY, IS THAT WE

[Captioner] 19:09:56

CAN'T TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE HUNDREDS OF


[Captioner] 19:09:59
ADULTS AND STUDENTS WHO CONTACT US,
EAGER TO

[Captioner] 19:10:02
 TAKE CLIMATE CHANGE ACTION
THROUGH PLANTING TREES IN FREMONT.


[Captioner] 19:10:07
WE LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR SUPPORT IN
TAKING THE ACTION NECESSARY

[Captioner] 19:10:10
 TO MAKE
VOLUNTEER OPPORTUNITIES

[Captioner] 19:10:13
 AVAILABLE AND
IMPROVE THE TREE CANOPY IN FREMONT.


[Captioner] 19:10:17
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:10:22
>> Mr. Quintanilla: OUR NEXT SPEAKER
IS ANNIE

[Captioner] 19:10:26
 CARUDA.


[Captioner] 19:10:33
>> HI.
I'M ANNIE.
AND I'M ALSO HERE TO

[Captioner] 19:10:36
 TALK ABOUT THE
URBAN FOREST MANAGEMENT  PLAN.


[Captioner] 19:10:40
SPECIFICALLY, THE CITY OF FREMONT
RECEIVED

[Captioner] 19:10:43
 SEED MONEY FROM CAL FIRE IN
2019 TO JUMP START

[Captioner] 19:10:46
 OUR URBAN FOREST,
WHICH IS GREAT, BUT UNFORTUNATELY,

[Captioner] 19:10:49
 SOME
OF THE ENSUING RESULTS HAVE BEEN A BIT


[Captioner] 19:10:52
LESS THAN IDEAL.
THE DATA IN THE NEWEST TREE

[Captioner] 19:10:56
 TECHNICAL
REPORT SHOWS THAT FREMONT'S TREE EQUITY

[Captioner] 19:10:58

SCORE IS EIGHTH OUT OF 8 WHEN COMPARED


[Captioner] 19:11:01
TO OTHER BAY AREA CITIES, AND SOME OF
OUR CENSUS BLOCKS

[Captioner] 19:11:05
 HAVE 5% TREE COVER
WHILE OTHERS HAVE MORE THAN 20%.


[Captioner] 19:11:09
ADDITIONALLY, TO ACHIEVE THE STATED

[Captioner] 19:11:12
 24%
TREE COVER GOAL BY 2062 IN THE

[Captioner] 19:11:16
 REPORT,
AROUND 3,000 TREES WOULD NEED TO BE
PLANTED

[Captioner] 19:11:19
 PER YEAR AND OUR CITY ISN'T ON
PACE RIGHT NOW.


[Captioner] 19:11:24
MULTIPLE CITIZEN GROUPS AND NON-PROFITS
ARE INTERESTED IN

[Captioner] 19:11:27
 WORKING TO HELP PLANT
TREES SUCH AS URBAN

[Captioner] 19:11:31
 FOREST FRIENDS.
BUT SUFFICIENT COLLABORATION ON THIS
FRONT HASN'T

[Captioner] 19:11:34
 YET OCCURRED.
SOME CITED EXPLANATIONS FOR

[Captioner] 19:11:37
 THIS ARE
CONCERNS THAT THERE MIGHT NOT BE
CAPACITY TO

[Captioner] 19:11:40
 CARE FOR MANY OF THE NEWLY
PLANTED TREES AND

[Captioner] 19:11:44
 THE POTENTIAL THAT
VOLUNTEERS MAY TAKE AWAY WORK FROM

[Captioner] 19:11:47

UNIONIZED STAFF.
AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT THESE ARE REAL

[Captioner] 19:11:51

CONCERNS.
AND WE WANT TO EXTEND A HAND TO

[Captioner] 19:11:55
 PROBLEM
SOLVE AND WORK IN COLLABORATION.


[Captioner] 19:11:58
YOU AS A CITY COUNCIL WILL SOON BE
VOTING TO ADOPT THE URBAN FOREST

[Captioner] 19:12:02

MANAGEMENT PLAN LIKELY ON APRIL

[Captioner] 19:12:05
 18TH,
AND WE WOULD LIKE TO SUGGEST THE HIRING


[Captioner] 19:12:08
OF A DEDICATED ARBORIST AND ENSURING
THAT THIS JOB

[Captioner] 19:12:11
 DESCRIPTION IS REASONABLE
FOR ONE PERSON

[Captioner] 19:12:15
 TO DO OR HIRING MULTIPLE
PEOPLE TO ADDRESS MANY OF THE

[Captioner] 19:12:17

ABOVE-CITED CONCERNS AND ENSURE THAT OUR


[Captioner] 19:12:21
TREE CANOPY HERE IN FREMONT IS HEALTHY,
IS EQUITABLE AND IS SUFFICIENT.


[Captioner] 19:12:27
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:12:32
>> Mr. Quintanilla: OUR NEXT SPEAKER
IS GEORGE

[Captioner] 19:12:35
 HUANG.
>> HELLO.
I ALSO WANT TO SPEAK ON

[Captioner] 19:12:38
 BEHALF OF URBAN
FOREST FRIENDS.
I

[Captioner] 19:12:42
 WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THE FIRST CAL FIRE
GRANT THAT FREMONT OBTAINED

[Captioner] 19:12:45
 IN 2019 AND
EXPIRING AT THE END OF THIS MONTH

[Captioner] 19:12:48
.
WE ACCOMPLISHED SOME IMPORTANT
OBJECTIVES.


[Captioner] 19:12:51
OUR FIRST CITYWIDE TREE INVENTORY AND

[Captioner] 19:12:55

CANOPY ASSESSMENT WAS COMPLETED,

[Captioner] 19:12:58
 HELPED
TO DEVELOP THE FIRST URBAN FOREST
MANAGEMENT

[Captioner] 19:13:02
 PLAN.
HOWEVER VERY IMPORTANTLY, THIS CAL FIRE


[Captioner] 19:13:05
GRANT SPECIFIES THAT THE CITY SHOULD AND
I QUOTE DIRECTLY FROM

[Captioner] 19:13:08
 THE GRANT
ESTABLISH A NEW URBAN FORESTER

[Captioner] 19:13:12
 PROGRAM
MANAGER POSITION TO OVERSEE THE
IMPLEMENTATION,

[Captioner] 19:13:15
 ADMINISTRATION, AND
ADHERENCE OF THE GRANT PROJECT AND URBAN


[Captioner] 19:13:19
FOREST MANAGEMENT PLAN.
THE GRANT GOES ON TO INCLUDE MANY

[Captioner] 19:13:22
 MORE
SPECIFIC RESPONSIBILITIES DIRECTLY

[Captioner] 19:13:26

CONCERNED WITH GRANT MANAGEMENT.
AGAIN

[Captioner] 19:13:30
, I'LL QUOTE THE GRANT, THE MANAGER
WILL BE SOLELY

[Captioner] 19:13:33
 DEDICATED TO THE
MANAGEMENT OF THIS GRANT PROJECT.


[Captioner] 19:13:37
CAL FIRE COMMITTED $860,000 TO THE

[Captioner] 19:13:40
 GRANT
AND FREMONT MATCHED $340,000 TO PAY FOR

[Captioner] 19:13:43

THIS MANAGER POSITION.
HOWEVER, IN

[Captioner] 19:13:46
 2020, THIS JOB DESIGNATION
DISAPPEARED.
THE STAFF

[Captioner] 19:13:49
 MEMBER WAS RENAMED AND GIVEN
THE

[Captioner] 19:13:52
 DUTIES OF CITY ARBORIST IN ADDITION
TO THE GRANT ADMINISTRATOR.


[Captioner] 19:13:57
HE RESIGNED IN PROTEST IN

[Captioner] 19:13:59
 SEPTEMBER 2022
SAYING IT WAS TOO MUCH WORK FOR A SINGLE


[Captioner] 19:14:03
PERSON.
THIS IMPORTANT JOB HAS SINCE REMAINED
VACANT.


[Captioner] 19:14:07
THE NEW JOB POSTING FOR THE ROLE PLANS
TO HAVE A NEW

[Captioner] 19:14:10
 URBAN FORESTER TAKE ON THE
CITY ARBORIST MANAGEMENT DUTIES

[Captioner] 19:14:13
 AGAIN IN
ADDITION TO GRANT MANAGEMENT.
THIS WILL TAKE MUCH

[Captioner] 19:14:16
 TIME AWAY FROM GRANT
WORK AND THE WORK ON THE URBAN

[Captioner] 19:14:19
 FOREST
MANAGEMENT PLAN, WHICH ALSO DOES NOT
SATISFY THE

[Captioner] 19:14:22
 TERMS OF THE GRANT.
AS YOU WILL HEAR, THIS WILL NOT WORK
GOING ON FORWARD.


[Captioner] 19:14:25
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:14:30
>> Mr. Quintanilla: NEXT SPEAKER IS

[Captioner] 19:14:34

LYNN MILLER.


[Captioner] 19:14:46
JARVIS LEONG.
>> I'M A MEMBER OF

[Captioner] 19:14:49
 URBAN FOREST
FRIENDS.
I WILL BRIEFLY POINT OUT

[Captioner] 19:14:52
 SOME OF THE
ITEMS NOT ACCOMPLISHED ON C

[Captioner] 19:14:55
 CAL FIRE
GRANT NUMBER 1.
ASIDE FROM

[Captioner] 19:14:58
 THE CONTRACTED COMPONENTS OF
THE CAL FIRE GRANT

[Captioner] 19:15:01
 COMPLETED, THERE ARE
DELIVERABLES FROM THE FIRST CAL FIRE
GRANT THAT

[Captioner] 19:15:04
 WERE NOT DONE AND INSTEAD
MOVED INTO THE TO BE DONE

[Captioner] 19:15:07
 CALENDAR OF
THE UPCOMING URBAN FOREST MANAGEMENT
PLAN THAT WILL COME BEFORE

[Captioner] 19:15:11
 YOU.
A WORKING TEAM FROM THE

[Captioner] 19:15:15
 DEPARTMENT --
THE TREES AND COMMUNITY URBAN FORESTERS


[Captioner] 19:15:19
WAS CREATED TO REVIEW AND REVISE TREE
ORDINANCES AND INTERDEPARTMENTAL

[Captioner] 19:15:22

WORKFLOWS.
BUT A TREE ADVISING WORKING GROUP WAS

[Captioner] 19:15:25

ONLY ANNOUNCED LAST WEEK AT THE PARKS
AND RECREATION COMMITTEE MEETING.


[Captioner] 19:15:29
NO REVIEWS HAVE TAKEN PLACE.
A NEW STREET TREE LIST IS

[Captioner] 19:15:32
 STILL TO BE
DEVELOPED, REVIEWED

[Captioner] 19:15:35
 AND IMPLEMENTED ON
THE CITY WEBSITE.
NO MEDIA

[Captioner] 19:15:38
 PROMOTIONS OTHER THAN TWO ZOOM
MEETINGS OCCURRED IN THE PAST FOUR
YEARS.


[Captioner] 19:15:41
MEDIA WAS TO BRING AWARENESS TO
RESIDENTS ABOUT

[Captioner] 19:15:45
 THE NEED TO MAINTAIN AND
GROW OUR URBAN TREE

[Captioner] 19:15:48
 CANOPY SO THAT
CITIZENS WOULD BE EDUCATED ABOUT

[Captioner] 19:15:51
 AND
RECEPTIVE TO STREET TREE STEWARDSHIP.


[Captioner] 19:15:55
A TREE ADVISORY COMMITTEE WAS NOT FORMED
TO PROVIDE A VENUE FOR

[Captioner] 19:15:58
 TREE DISPUTES AND
APPEALS, THEN SUDDENLY LAST WEEK A

[Captioner] 19:16:01
 TREE
TECHNICAL COMMITTEE WAS ANNOUNCED

[Captioner] 19:16:05
,
COMPOSED ENTIRELY OF CITY STAFF.
SO IT'S NOT CLEAR HOW THE

[Captioner] 19:16:08
 COMMUNITY WILL
BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN SOME OF THESE

[Captioner] 19:16:11

COMMITTEES.
LASTLY INSTEAD OF HAVING AN UP AND

[Captioner] 19:16:15

RUNNING

[Captioner] 19:16:19
 IMPLEMENTATION PLAN FOR WHERE
NEW TREES WILL BE

[Captioner] 19:16:22
 PLANTED, THE WHERE,
WHEN AND HOW OF TREE PLANTING

[Captioner] 19:16:25
 IS STILL
TO BE -- LEFT TO BE DETERMINED.

SO I'D LIKE TO DEPART FROM THAT
TRADITION, BREAK A NEW PATH

[Captioner] 19:17:24
 AND MAKE MY
OWN REQUEST ON BEHALF OF A GROUP

[Captioner] 19:17:28
 THAT I
HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH.
FREMONT HAS THE

[Captioner] 19:17:32
 LARGEST AFGHAN
COMMUNITY OUTSIDE OF

[Captioner] 19:17:35
 AFGHAN STAN.


[Captioner] 19:17:40
THE MOST IMPORTANT SECULAR -- FOR ALL
THE PEOPLES

[Captioner] 19:17:44
 OF CENTRAL ASIA.
THIS IS CENTERVILLE, TO

[Captioner] 19:17:47
 USE THE --
CENTERVILLE'S HOLIDAY IS

[Captioner] 19:17:50
 NORUSE.
IT'S COMING UP IN ABOUT, WHAT, TWO
WEEKS?


[Captioner] 19:17:56
AND EMBARRASSINGLY ENOUGH, THERE'S THIS
TOWN

[Captioner] 19:17:59
 THAT'S NOT EVEN INCORPORATED, THEY

[Captioner] 19:18:03

POPPED UP THOUSANDS

[Captioner] 19:18:06
 OF NEW

[Captioner] 19:18:09
 HOUSES IN
MIDDLE OF FEELS, IT'S CALLED MOUNTAIN
HOUSE

[Captioner] 19:18:13
 IN SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY, AND THEY
ARE RUNNING A MEETING RIGHT

[Captioner] 19:18:17
 NOW AT THIS
VERY MOMENT AND ON THE AGENDA, IT

[Captioner] 19:18:20
 SAYS,
OBSERVATION OF NORUSE OR

[Captioner] 19:18:24
 COMMEMORATION,

[Captioner] 19:18:28
,
IT SAYS PROCLAMATION FOR NORUSE.


[Captioner] 19:18:33
AND THIS AGENDA DOESN'T HAVE THAT.
FREMONT DIDN'T

[Captioner] 19:18:35
 DO IT LAST YEAR.
FREMONT SEEMS TO HAVE FORGOTTEN ABOUT
THIS.


[Captioner] 19:18:39
WHAT THE HECK IS GOING ON HERE?
IT --

[Captioner] 19:18:42
 THIS IS EMBARRASSING.
AND FOR ME TO HAVE TO COME HERE

[Captioner] 19:18:44
 AND TELL
YOU ABOUT IT, YOU SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF


[Captioner] 19:18:48
IT YOURSELVES AND YOU SHOULD HAVE TOLD
YOUR STAFF A MONTH AGO OR TWO

[Captioner] 19:18:51
 MONTHS AGO
TO GO FIGURE THIS

[Captioner] 19:18:54
 OUT AND PUT THIS ON
THE LIST.
THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 19:21:28
PLEASE, IF YOU GET A CHANCE, TAKE A

[Captioner] 19:21:32
 LOOK
AT THAT JOB POSTING.
ONCE AGAIN, IT IS A

[Captioner] 19:21:35

 A MANAGERIAL CITY ARBORIST AND AN
URBAN FOREST MANAGER.


[Captioner] 19:21:42

[Captioner] 19:22:00

DELIVERABLES UNACCOMPLISHED.
AS KERMIT THE FROG

 SAYS, IT'S JUST NOT
EASY BEING GREEN.
THANK YOU.

KATHRYN RUBIE.
>> HI.
CAN YOU HEAR ME ALL RIGHT?


[Captioner] 19:22:20
>> Mr. Quintanilla: YES,

[Captioner] 19:22:24

>> OKAY, THANK YOU.
AS YOU KNOW, MY NAME IS

[Captioner] 19:22:28
 KATHERINE
RUBIE.
I AM SPEAKING FOR

[Captioner] 19:22:31
 MYSELF.
AND PERHAPS ANY OTHER

[Captioner] 19:22:34
 AT RISK PEOPLE FOR
HOMELESSNESS AND, OF COURSE, THE

[Captioner] 19:22:38

HOMELESS.
NOT ANY ORGANIZATIONS AT THIS

[Captioner] 19:22:41
 TIME.


[Captioner] 19:22:46
I AM A RESIDENT OF

[Captioner] 19:22:49
 THIS COUNTY FOR MANY
YEARS, AND FREMONT SEEMS TO BE

[Captioner] 19:22:52
 WHERE I
DO EVERYTHING.
IT'S WHERE EVERYTHING

[Captioner] 19:22:55
 IS THAT I CARE
ABOUT.
AND I

[Captioner] 19:22:59
 AM CURRENTLY LOOKING FOR HOUSING
YET AGAIN,

[Captioner] 19:23:02
 AND I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR
OVER A YEAR AND HAVE

[Captioner] 19:23:05
 NOT FOUND ANY
ABILITY TO FIND

[Captioner] 19:23:09
 HOUSING, AND I AM
SUPPOSED TO MOVE OUT BY

[Captioner] 19:23:12
 THE END OF THIS
MONTH, AND I FEAR THAT

[Captioner] 19:23:15
 I MAY YET BECOME
HOMELESS ONCE AGAIN.


[Captioner] 19:23:20
AND I AM VERY FRUSTRATED BY THIS.
AND I

[Captioner] 19:23:24
 FEEL LIKE OUR SYSTEM IS NOT
WORKING.


[Captioner] 19:23:28
WHATEVER IT IS, IT'S NOT WORKING, AND WE
REALLY, REALLY, REALLY NEED

[Captioner] 19:23:31
 TO TRY AND
GET BETTER THINGS

[Captioner] 19:23:34
 GOING FOR PEOPLE LIKE
MYSELF AND FOR PEOPLE WHO

[Captioner] 19:23:38
 ARE ALREADY
HOMELESS.
IT IS A TERRIBLE SITUATION TO

[Captioner] 19:23:41
 GO
THROUGH.
I'VE BEEN

[Captioner] 19:23:44
 THERE, I DON'T LIKE IT, AND
THERE'S NO REASON FOR ANY OF US TO BE

[Captioner] 19:23:48

HOMELESS WHEN WE HAVE RESOURCES

[Captioner] 19:23:51
 OUT THE
WAZOO.
AND I AM IN

[Captioner] 19:23:55
 A DESPERATE SITUATION HERE.
I HAVE NOWHERE TO GO, AND I'M SUPPOSED

[Captioner] 19:23:58

TO BE OUT OF MY PLACE IN THREE WEEKS.
YOU

[Captioner] 19:24:01
 KNOW, THIS IS RIDICULOUS.


[Captioner] 19:24:04
I APPLIED FOR THE GRANITE RIDGE.


[Captioner] 19:24:08
I DIDN'T EVEN GET A WORD IN, YOU

[Captioner] 19:24:11
 KNOW,
ON WHETHER OR NOT I WAS GOING TO
QUALIFY, AND YET I

[Captioner] 19:24:15
 QUALIFIED UNDER TWO
OF THE

[Captioner] 19:24:19
 THREE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE
RESERVED

[Captioner] 19:24:22
 APARTMENTS OUTSIDE OF THE
LOTTERY.
AND I DIDN'T GET

[Captioner] 19:24:25
 A CALL, YOU KNOW, AND
THE HOUSING BEING BUILT

[Captioner] 19:24:29
 IS SLOW IN
COMING.
THE PROGRAM

[Captioner] 19:24:32
S WE'RE OFFERING FOR THE
HOMELESS ARE MINIMAL AT BEST.


[Captioner] 19:24:36
WE'RE NOT DOING ENOUGH.
AND I JUST WANT

[Captioner] 19:24:39
 US TO REALLY BE AWARE OF
THE FACT

[Captioner] 19:24:42
 THAT WE AREN'T DOING ENOUGH.
AND THERE ARE

[Captioner] 19:24:45
 PEOPLE GETTING READY TO
BECOME HOME

[Captioner] 19:24:49
LESS ONCE THIS MORATORIUM

[Captioner] 19:24:52

ENDS, AND THERE'S GOING TO BE EVEN MORE


[Captioner] 19:24:55
OF US OUT ON THE STREET.
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.
I

[Captioner] 19:24:57
 DON'T EVEN HAVE A CAR TO LIVE IN RIGHT
NOW.


[Captioner] 19:25:00
I JUST -- I'M FRUSTRATED

[Captioner] 19:25:03
.
I'M SCARED, AND I AM JUST --

[Captioner] 19:25:07
 I'M UPSET
BECAUSE WE'RE NOT MOVING FAST ENOUGH ON

[Captioner] 19:25:10

ISSUES.
AND I JUST BEG YOU TO START

[Captioner] 19:25:13
 THINKING
ABOUT THESE THINGS

[Captioner] 19:25:14
 MORE CONSISTENTLY
THAN WE DO.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:25:22
>> Mr. Quintanilla: THAT WAS OUR FINAL
SPEAKER.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:25:28
I APPRECIATE EVERYONE'S COMMENTS, AND WE
ARE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT

[Captioner] 19:25:31
 SOME OF
THE ITEMS THAT WERE MENTIONED IN THE
FUTURE AGENDA

[Captioner] 19:25:34
 ITEMS.


[Captioner] 19:25:38
AND I KNOW THAT WE'VE HAD SOME
CONVERSATION WITH

[Captioner] 19:25:41
 OUR STAFF IN
PARTICULAR, AND THE CITY

[Captioner] 19:25:44
 MANAGER AND
ALSO I THINK SUZANNE WOLF

[Captioner] 19:25:48
 WILL BE
FOLLOWING UP ON THIS ITEM.
SORRY -- WELL, SHENFIL

[Captioner] 19:25:51
 ON THIS ONE, BUT
ON THE OTHER ITEM, ON THE TREES, YES.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:25:55
AND AT THIS TIME, WE HAVE VOTED AND

[Captioner] 19:25:58

AGREED TO MOVE AHEAD WITH THE REFERRAL


[Captioner] 19:26:03
ITEMS.
SO INSTEAD WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO THE
REFERRAL ITEMS FIRST THIS

[Captioner] 19:26:06
 EVENING,
BEFORE THE BUDGET UPDATE.
SO WE'LL BEGIN

[Captioner] 19:26:09
 WITH ITEM 7A.
WHICH IS THE

[Captioner] 19:26:13
 REFERRAL FOR CONSIDERATION
OF

[Captioner] 19:26:17
 LUNAR NEW YEAR AS A CITY OF FREMONT
PAID HOLIDAY

[Captioner] 19:26:20
 COMMENCING IN 2024.
AND SO

[Captioner] 19:26:24
 COUNCILMEMBER -- VICE MAYOR KENG,
WOULD YOU LIKE TO INTRODUCE THAT.
>> Vice Mayor Keng: THANK YOU, MADAME


[Captioner] 19:26:28
MAYOR.
GOOD EVENING, EVERYONE.
SO TODAY I HAVE

[Captioner] 19:26:31
 BEFORE YOU A REFERRAL
FOR THE COUNCIL

[Captioner] 19:26:35
 TO CONSIDER FOR LUNAR
NEW YEAR TO BE CELEBRATED AS A CITY

[Captioner] 19:26:38

HOLIDAY STARTING IN 2024.


[Captioner] 19:26:41
SO LET ME ALLOW ME TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE
BACKGROUND, SO IN

[Captioner] 19:26:46
 SEPTEMBER 2022,

[Captioner] 19:26:49

ASSEMBLYMEMBER EVAN LOWE INTRODUCED
ASSEMBLY BILL

[Captioner] 19:26:53
 AB2596, WHICH DESIGNATES
LUNAR NEW YEAR AS A STATE

[Captioner] 19:26:57
 HOLIDAY.
AS WE

[Captioner] 19:27:00
 KNOW, ANTI-ASIAN RACISM HAS RISEN
MORE THAN 300% IN THE LAST FEW

[Captioner] 19:27:03
 YEARS
SINCE THE PANDEMIC.
IN THE MOST RECENT CENSUS, WE

[Captioner] 19:27:07
 SEE THAT
FREMONT HAS MORE THAN 50% OF ASIAN

[Captioner] 19:27:10

AMERICANS IN POPULATION, AS WELL AS

[Captioner] 19:27:13

HAVING MORE THAN 50% OF OUR RESIDENTS
BEING BORN OUTSIDE OF THE COUNTRY.


[Captioner] 19:27:16
IT IS APPROPRIATE THAT WE RECOGNIZE

[Captioner] 19:27:18

LUNAR NEW YEAR AS A RECOGNITION OF THE


[Captioner] 19:27:21
CONTRIBUTION OF OUR API COMMUNITY.
ON

[Captioner] 19:27:26
 SEPTEMBER 29TH, 2022, GOVERNOR NEWSOM

[Captioner] 19:27:29

SIGNED THREE STATE HOLIDAY BILLS INTO
LAW BEFORE THE DEADLINE OF

[Captioner] 19:27:32
 THE
LEGISLATIVE YEAR.
ONE OF THE THREE

[Captioner] 19:27:35
 NEW CALIFORNIA STATE
HOLIDAYS STARTING IN 2023 IS THE

[Captioner] 19:27:39
 LUNAR
NEW YEAR HOLIDAY.
THE GOVERNOR STATED, QUOTE,

[Captioner] 19:27:42
 THE LUNAR
NEW YEAR CELEBRATES A CHANCE TO LEAVE
BEHIND THE

[Captioner] 19:27:45
 TROUBLES OF THE PAST YEAR AND
INVITE PROSPERITY AND GOOD LUCK

[Captioner] 19:27:49
 MOVING
FORWARD.
RECOGNIZING THIS DAY AS A

[Captioner] 19:27:52
 STATE HOLIDAY
ACKNOWLEDGES THE DIVERSITY AND

[Captioner] 19:27:55
 CULTURAL
SIGNIFICANCE ASIAN AMERICANS BRING

[Captioner] 19:27:58
 TO
CALIFORNIA, AND PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY


[Captioner] 19:28:01
FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS TO PARTICIPATE IN
THE

[Captioner] 19:28:05
 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE LUNAR NEW YEAR.


[Captioner] 19:28:10
END QUOTE.
THE GOVERNOR ADDED, QUOTE, I AM

[Captioner] 19:28:13

IMMENSELY PROUD OF THE RICHNESS OF
DIVERSITY AND

[Captioner] 19:28:16
 BACKGROUNDS REPRESENTED IN
OUR STATE AND UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE


[Captioner] 19:28:19
OF WANTING TO SEE ONE'S OWN EXPERIENCE
REFLECTED IN STATE

[Captioner] 19:28:23
 HOLIDAYS.
END QUOTE.
SO I

[Captioner] 19:28:26
 WOULD BE -- OF COURSE WE HAVE TO
TAKE INTO

[Captioner] 19:28:29
 CONSIDERATION OF THE FISCAL

[Captioner] 19:28:33

IMPACT THE PAID HOLIDAY WILL BRING,
WHICH IS

[Captioner] 19:28:36
 WHY I'M BRINGING FORWARD

[Captioner] 19:28:40
 THE
COUNCIL TO ALLOW THE CITY STAFF TO

[Captioner] 19:28:43

RESEARCH THE FISCAL IMPACTS AND I WILL


[Captioner] 19:28:46
BE OPEN FOR THE REFERRAL TO BE EITHER A
PAID HOLIDAY OR

[Captioner] 19:28:50
 A FLEX HOLIDAY
UNDERSTANDING

[Captioner] 19:28:53
 THE COSTS THAT THIS -- AN

[Captioner] 19:28:57

ADDITIONAL HOLIDAY WILL BRING,

[Captioner] 19:29:00
 SO IT
WILL BE SIMILAR TO WHAT THE GOVERNOR
ENACTED FOR

[Captioner] 19:29:04
 THE STATE FOR THE STATE
HOLIDAY, WHICH AUTHORIZES ANY

[Captioner] 19:29:07
 STATE
EMPLOYEE TO UTILIZE EIGHT HOURS OF

[Captioner] 19:29:11

VACATION, ANNUAL LEAVE, OR COMPENSATING


[Captioner] 19:29:15
TIME OFF IN LIEU OF RECEIVING EIGHT
HOURS OF PERSONAL

[Captioner] 19:29:18
 HOLIDAY CREDIT TO
OBSERVE THE LUNAR NEW YEAR, WHICH GIVES

[Captioner] 19:29:21

US THE FLEXIBILITY OF TAKING

[Captioner] 19:29:25
 LUNAR NEW
YEAR THE  DAY.
SO

[Captioner] 19:29:28
 EVEN IF WE ARE IN THE FUTURE

[Captioner] 19:29:32

DESIGNATING LUNAR NEW YEAR AS A NON-PAID

[Captioner] 19:29:35

HOLIDAY, IT WILL STILL RECOGNIZE THE

[Captioner] 19:29:39

SIGNIFICANCE OF THE CULTURAL AND
HERITAGE OF THE

[Captioner] 19:29:43
 ASIAN AMERICAN
COMMUNITIES.
SO THIS CONCLUDES

[Captioner] 19:29:46
 MY PRESENTATION, AND I
APPRECIATE YOUR CONSIDERATION.


[Captioner] 19:29:49
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:29:54
>> Mayor Mei: WOULD STAFF LIKE TO
COMMENT ON THE ABILITY OF

[Captioner] 19:29:57
 THE HOLIDAY TO
BE PAID OR UNPAID?
I KNOW I'VE SEEN

[Captioner] 19:30:01
 MR. PERSSELIN IN THE
AUDIENCE, BEFORE WE TAKE SOME OF THE
PUBLIC

[Captioner] 19:30:04
 COMMENTS.


[Captioner] 19:30:09
>> City Mgr. Shackelford: OF COURSE AS
A PAID HOLIDAY, THERE WOULD BE SOME
COSTS

[Captioner] 19:30:12
 INVOLVED, AND AS WE SAW WITH THE
RECENT HOLIDAY THAT WE ADDED

[Captioner] 19:30:15
 BACK IN

[Captioner] 19:30:18

22-23, THE JUNETEENTH HOLIDAY, THE COST


[Captioner] 19:30:21
FOR THAT WAS ABOUT $240,000.


[Captioner] 19:30:24
OF COURSE THAT WAS IN FISCAL YEAR

[Captioner] 19:30:28

2022-23-DOLLARS, AND DID INCLUDE

[Captioner] 19:30:31
 THE
COST OF ANY NEW POSITIONS THAT HAVE BEEN

[Captioner] 19:30:34

ADDED TO THE BUDGET SINCE THEN, NOR

[Captioner] 19:30:38
 DOES
IT -- NOR IS IT REFLECTIVE OF SALARY

[Captioner] 19:30:41

INCREASES DUE TO LABOR NEGOTIATIONS.
SO I JUST SHARE

[Captioner] 19:30:44
 THAT WITH YOU AS A
BENCHMARK

[Captioner] 19:30:47
 TO CONSIDER AS YOU THINK ABOUT
HOW TO MOVE FORWARD

[Captioner] 19:30:50
 WITH THE REFERRAL.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
AND

[Captioner] 19:30:53
 I ALSO WANTED TO CLARIFY, I'LL ASK
THE FOLLOWING QUESTION.


[Captioner] 19:30:57
I BELIEVE WHEN WE ADDED THAT, THAT WAS
IN PERPETUITY, AT LEAST FOR THE TERMS

[Captioner] 19:31:00
 OF
THIS CURRENT CONTRACT?


[Captioner] 19:31:04
>> City Mgr. Shackelford: YES, YOUR
APPROVAL OF THE JUNETEENTH HOLIDAY

[Captioner] 19:31:07
 WAS
FROM THE POINT APPROVED ON.


[Captioner] 19:31:12
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY.


[Captioner] 19:31:16
I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR -- ARE THERE ANY
QUESTIONS FROM THE

[Captioner] 19:31:18
 COUNCIL?
>> City Mgr. Shackelford: ONE MORE
THING.


[Captioner] 19:31:22
AND I WOULD ALSO SAY THAT

[Captioner] 19:31:25
 THE IDEA OF --

[Captioner] 19:31:27

AS YOU CONSIDER THIS, I THINK VICE MAYOR


[Captioner] 19:31:30
KENG MENTIONED THAT SHE'D BE OPEN TO
THIS AS WELL, BUT THE

[Captioner] 19:31:33
 IDEA OF ANOTHER
FLOATING HOLIDAY AS OPPOSED TO

[Captioner] 19:31:36
 A NAMED
HOLIDAY IS SOMETHING

[Captioner] 19:31:39
 ELSE THAT IT SEEMS
LIKE SHE'S OPEN TO YOU ALL CONSIDERING


[Captioner] 19:31:42
AS WELL.
>> Mayor Mei: I'M VERY GLAD TO HEAR
THAT,

[Captioner] 19:31:45
 BECAUSE I SUGGESTED THAT
ORIGINALLY TOO, BECAUSE I RECOGNIZE

[Captioner] 19:31:48
 OUR
DIVERSITY OF OUR COMMUNITY.


[Captioner] 19:31:54
SO DO WE HAVE ANY SPEAKERS FOR THIS?
>> Mr. Quintanilla: YES, WE HAVE TWO

[Captioner] 19:31:57

SPEAKER CARDS.
FIRST SPEAKER, JOHN

[Captioner] 19:32:00
 HINDS.


[Captioner] 19:32:11
>> WHEN I GOT MARRIED, ABOUT A HUNDRED

[Captioner] 19:32:14

YEARS AGO, WE WERE SENDING OUT WEDDING

[Captioner] 19:32:17

INVITATIONS, AND WE FOUND THAT IF WE
INVITED THIS

[Captioner] 19:32:22
 FAMILY, OOO, THEN WE REALLY
HAVE TO INVITE THIS OTHER FAMILY TOO
BECAUSE IF

[Captioner] 19:32:25
 WE INVITE ONE WITHOUT THE
OTHER, WHAT KIND OF MESSAGE WOULD THAT


[Captioner] 19:32:29
SEND?
BUT WITH THAT SECOND FAMILY, OH, NOW WE


[Captioner] 19:32:32
REALLY HAVE TO BRING THIS OTHER ONE IN
BECAUSE IF WE

[Captioner] 19:32:35
 EXCLUDE ANYBODY, WHAT KIND
OF MESSAGE WOULD THAT SEND?


[Captioner] 19:32:39
THIS WENT ON ALMOST TO INFINITY,

[Captioner] 19:32:42
 BECAUSE
IF WE LEFT ANYONE OUT, WHAT KIND OF
MESSAGE

[Captioner] 19:32:45
 WOULD THAT SEND?
I HOPE YOU

[Captioner] 19:32:49
 CAN SEE THE SIMILARITY TO
THESE HOLIDAY DECLARATIONS.


[Captioner] 19:32:52
IF WE DECLARE A FULL PAID

[Captioner] 19:32:56
 HOLIDAY IN A
RECOGNITION OF A CULTURAL, ETHNIC

[Captioner] 19:32:59
 OR
OTHER GROUP, THEN WE ESTABLISH A

[Captioner] 19:33:02

PRINCIPLE THAT CAN BE FOLLOWED BY
SOMEONE ELSE THE NEXT DAY

[Captioner] 19:33:06
 TO REQUEST
SIMILAR RECOGNITION FOR THEIR GROUP.


[Captioner] 19:33:09
AND AT THAT POINT, WE'LL HAVE NO WAY TO
TURN THEM DOWN

[Captioner] 19:33:12
 WITHOUT LOOKING UNFAIR OR
HYPOCRITICAL,

[Captioner] 19:33:15
 AND WHAT KIND OF MESSAGE
WOULD THAT SEND?


[Captioner] 19:33:19
NOW, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SOME FOLKS ARE
TAKING

[Captioner] 19:33:22
 AN EXAMPLE FROM THE RECENT
RECOGNITION

[Captioner] 19:33:26
 OF JUNETEENTH, WHICH I THINK
IS BETTER CALLED

[Captioner] 19:33:29
 FREEDOM DAY, TO
EMPHASIZE THAT IT IS NOT A RECOGNITION

[Captioner] 19:33:32

OF ANY CULTURAL OR ETHNIC GROUP, IT IS

[Captioner] 19:33:35

INSTEAD A MILESTONE IN U.S. HISTORY WHEN


[Captioner] 19:33:39
A CORE FOUNDING PRINCIPLE BECAME

[Captioner] 19:33:42
 MUCH
MORE FULLY REALIZED AT A GREAT COST OF


[Captioner] 19:33:45
LIVES.
THERE WAS A WAR.


[Captioner] 19:33:49
SO JUNETEENTH, OR FREEDOM DAY, IS MORE

[Captioner] 19:33:53

NATURALLY A GOVERNMENT HOLIDAY FOR
REASONS THAT

[Captioner] 19:33:56
 ARE VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE
REASONS

[Captioner] 19:33:59
 WE HEAR IN FAVOR OF LUNAR NEW
YEAR OR DIWALI,

[Captioner] 19:34:02
 TO TAKE ANOTHER RECENT
EXAMPLE.
NOW I LOVE

[Captioner] 19:34:05
 CELEBRATIONS, BUT CITY STAFF
NEEDS SOME WORK DAYS TOO, AND

[Captioner] 19:34:09
 THEY COULD
ALWAYS CELEBRATE THESE HAPPY OCCASIONS

[Captioner] 19:34:11

WITH THE REST OF US ON THEIR OWN TIME.


[Captioner] 19:34:14
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:34:20
>> Mr. Quintanilla: OUR NEXT SPEAKER
IS

[Captioner] 19:34:23
 HENRY LIANG.


[Captioner] 19:34:33
>> IS THIS ON?


[Captioner] 19:34:37
GOOD EVENING, CITY COUNCIL.
MY NAME IS HENRY LIANG.


[Captioner] 19:34:40
I'M THE PRESIDENT OF CITIZEN FOR BETTER

[Captioner] 19:34:43

COMMUNITY.
I'M HERE TO SPEAK IN

[Captioner] 19:34:48
 SUPPORT OF VICE
MAYOR KENG'S REFERRAL

[Captioner] 19:34:51
 TO RECOGNIZE LUNAR
NEW YEAR AS A PAID CITY HOLIDAY.


[Captioner] 19:34:55
BEFORE I DIVE INTO THE REMARKS, I WOULD
LIKE TO TAKE A

[Captioner] 19:34:58
 MOMENT TO CONGRATULATE
CITY COUNCIL, ALL OF YOU, FOR

[Captioner] 19:35:02
 FREMONT
BEING VOTED AS THE HAPPIEST CITY IN

[Captioner] 19:35:04
 THE
UNITED STATES FOR THREE YEARS IN A ROW.


[Captioner] 19:35:08
THIS IS A TESTIMONY OF THE

[Captioner] 19:35:11
 INCREDIBLE
WORK OF ALL OF YOU TO OUR COMMUNITY FOR


[Captioner] 19:35:15
A BETTER PLACE TO LIVE AND PLAY.


[Captioner] 19:35:20
AS VICE MAYOR KENG POINTED OUT,

[Captioner] 19:35:24

CALIFORNIA AB2596 RECOGNIZES LUNAR NEW


[Captioner] 19:35:27
YEAR AS UNPAID HOLIDAY.


[Captioner] 19:35:31
HOWEVER, CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO AND
SEVERAL

[Captioner] 19:35:34
 CITIES IN ALAMEDA COUNTY,
INCLUDING

[Captioner] 19:35:39
 ALAMEDA, BERKELEY

[Captioner] 19:35:42
, -- OAKLAND,

[Captioner] 19:35:45
 SAN LEANDRO HAVE GONE A STEP

[Captioner] 19:35:47

FURTHER AND RECOGNIZE LUNAR NEW YEAR AS


[Captioner] 19:35:51
A PAID HOLIDAY.
FREMONT IS

[Captioner] 19:35:54
 HOME OF A LARGE AND ELABORATE
ASIAN COMMUNITY AND

[Captioner] 19:35:58
 LUNAR NEW YEAR IS AN
ESSENTIAL CULTURAL CELEBRATION FOR MANY


[Captioner] 19:36:01
OF OUR RESIDENTS.
BY ACKNOWLEDGING

[Captioner] 19:36:05
 THIS HOLIDAY AS A PAID
CITY HOLIDAY, WE CAN

[Captioner] 19:36:08
 DEMONSTRATE OUR
COMMITMENT TO

[Captioner] 19:36:12
 INCLUSIVITY AND RESPECT
TOWARD

[Captioner] 19:36:15
 OUR DIVERSE COMMUNITY.
I ALSO WANT TO

[Captioner] 19:36:18
 COMMEND

[Captioner] 19:36:21

MS.

[Captioner] 19:36:24
 SUZANNE WOLF AND HER

[Captioner] 19:36:28
 TEAM.
THE TURNOUT WAS FANTASTIC AND

[Captioner] 19:36:31
 THE
ATMOSPHERE WAS REVERENT.
IT WAS A

[Captioner] 19:36:35
 BEAUTIFUL EVENT OF

[Captioner] 19:36:38
 THAT BROUGHT
THE COMMUNITY TOGETHER TO

[Captioner] 19:36:41
 CELEBRATE THIS
SIGNIFICANT HOLIDAY.
AS THE CBC

[Captioner] 19:36:44
 IS ONE OF THE SPONSORS OF THE
LUNAR NEW YEAR EVENT I WOULD

[Captioner] 19:36:48
 SAY TO MEET
THE MAJORITY OF THE CITY COUNCIL HERE

[Captioner] 19:36:49

AND SHOW APPRECIATION FOR YOUR SUPPORT.


[Captioner] 19:36:54
IN CONCLUSION, I URGE THE CITY COUNCIL
TO

[Captioner] 19:36:58
 CONSIDER RECOGNIZING LUNAR NEW YEAR
AS A

[Captioner] 19:37:01
 PAID CITY

[Captioner] 19:37:04
 HOLIDAY THAT WILL

[Captioner] 19:37:08
 PROMOTE
DIVERSITY AND INCLUSIVITY AND ALSO

[Captioner] 19:37:09

ENRICH OUR COMMUNITY AND STRENGTHEN THE


[Captioner] 19:37:12
BONDS BETWEEN ALL OF US.
THANK YOU.
[APPLAUSE]


[Captioner] 19:37:17
>> Mr. Quintanilla: WE HAVE NO
ADDITIONAL SPEAKERS.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:37:20
AT THIS TIME I'LL TURN IT BACK TO THE
COUNCIL.
I SEE FIRST

[Captioner] 19:37:24
 IS COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN.


[Captioner] 19:37:27
>> Councilmember Salwan: THANK YOU,
MADAME MAYOR.
AND I'D LIKE

[Captioner] 19:37:30
 TO RECOGNIZE COUNCILMEMBER
KENG FOR RAISING THIS ISSUE.


[Captioner] 19:37:34
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT, LUNAR NEW YEAR

[Captioner] 19:37:38
 IS
CELEBRATED BY A LARGE SWATH OF
POPULATION ALL OVER

[Captioner] 19:37:41
 THE WORLD AND IT'S A
VERY IMPORTANT HOLIDAY.
WE

[Captioner] 19:37:45
 HAD A RECENT RETREAT AND WE HAD A
PREVIOUS MEETING

[Captioner] 19:37:49
 AS WELL WHERE WE
DISCUSSED HOW WE WOULD TRY TO

[Captioner] 19:37:52
 WORK ON
THESE ITEMS ON A COMPREHENSIVE

[Captioner] 19:37:55

GLOBAL APPROACH RATHER THAN AN

[Captioner] 19:37:59

INDIVIDUAL HOLIDAY, BECAUSE AS

[Captioner] 19:38:02

MANY OF YOU KNOW, WE'VE HAD MANY
SPEAKERS COMING IN RECENTLY

[Captioner] 19:38:04
 ASKING ABOUT
THE DIWALI HOLIDAY, AND I'M SURE THERE'S


[Captioner] 19:38:11
OTHERS LOOKING FOR CESAR CHAVEZ HOLIDAY,
I

[Captioner] 19:38:14
 KNOW A LOT OF OUR

[Captioner] 19:38:18
 EMPLOYEES ARE
INTERESTED IN THAT.


[Captioner] 19:38:21
PUBLIC WORKERS OFTEN GET BLAMED FOR
TAKING TOO MANY HOLIDAYS

[Captioner] 19:38:24
 AND IF WE KEEP
ADDING MORE HOLIDAYS THAT'S GOING TO
CONTINUE TO INCREASE

[Captioner] 19:38:27
 THE EXPENSES, WHICH
WILL FURTHER INCREASE THE RATE THAT

[Captioner] 19:38:30

TAXPAYERS HAVE TO PAY TO PAY FOR THESE


[Captioner] 19:38:35
HOLIDAYS.
SO I LIKE THE IDEA OF LOOKING AT IT AS A

[Captioner] 19:38:39

FLOATING HOLIDAY, SO THAT IF SOMEBODY
WANTS TO

[Captioner] 19:38:42
 CELEBRATE CESAR CHAVEZ
DAY, THEY CAN DO THAT, OR

[Captioner] 19:38:47

JUNETEENTH, OR DIWALI, OR

[Captioner] 19:38:50
 LUNAR NEW YEAR
OR ANY OTHER HOLIDAY THAT WE DON'T KNOW

[Captioner] 19:38:53

YET.


[Captioner] 19:38:56
MAYBE NOWRUZ, MR. ABREU

[Captioner] 19:38:59
 MENTIONED.
SO MAYBE WE CAN LOOK AT THIS
HOLISTICALLY, I'D LIKE

[Captioner] 19:39:02
 TO HAVE A DEEPER
DIVE AND FURTHER DISCUSSION TO DECIDE

[Captioner] 19:39:06

ALL THE DAYS WE WANT TO RECOGNIZE SO
THAT A WEEK

[Captioner] 19:39:09
 OR TWO FROM NOW, WE DON'T
HAVE SOMEBODY ELSE BRINGING DIWALI OR

[Captioner] 19:39:13

ANOTHER EVENT.
SO HOPEFULLY THIS

[Captioner] 19:39:16
 COUNCIL DIRECTION TO
LOOK AT THIS COMPREHENSIVELY AND

[Captioner] 19:39:19

HOLISTICALLY.
IF THERE'S NO SUCH WILL, THEN I WOULD


[Captioner] 19:39:23
LIKE TO SUBMIT OTHER HOLIDAYS RIGHT NOW
IF THERE'S NO OPPORTUNITY FOR

[Captioner] 19:39:26
 FURTHER
DISCUSSION, BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S
OTHER COMMUNITIES

[Captioner] 19:39:29
 THAT ALSO WOULD LIKE
TO BE RECOGNIZED.
BUT AGAIN, THE BIGGEST CONCERN

[Captioner] 19:39:33
 I HAVE IS
ABOUT THE FISCAL IMPACT, ADDING MORE

[Captioner] 19:39:36

HOLIDAYS, THAT'S $240,000 PER HOLIDAY,


[Captioner] 19:39:40
THAT WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE, PLUS THE
PENSIONS

[Captioner] 19:39:43
 AND ALL OF THE OTHER BENEFITS.
SO I THINK WE HAVE TO

[Captioner] 19:39:46
 BE COGNIZANT OF
THAT, ESPECIALLY DURING THIS TIME WITH

[Captioner] 19:39:49

THE ECONOMY AND ALL THE CONCERNS WE'RE


[Captioner] 19:39:52
FACING.
SO AGAIN, I SUPPORT THE EFFORT, I

[Captioner] 19:39:54

APPRECIATE COUNCILMEMBER KENG BRINGING


[Captioner] 19:39:57
THIS UP.
I THINK IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT OCCASION


[Captioner] 19:40:00
AND WE DO NEED TO RECOGNIZE IT, BUT WE
HAVE TO DO IT WITH EYES

[Captioner] 19:40:04
 WIDE OPEN.
THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK

[Captioner] 19:40:07
 YOU.
NEXT

[Captioner] 19:40:09
 I HAVE ON THE DAIS IS
COUNCILMEMBER COX.
>> Councilmember Cox: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:40:19
I REALLY APPRECIATE EVERYONE'S COMMENTS,
ESPECIALLY IN FREMONT,

[Captioner] 19:40:22
 WE'RE SO
DIVERSE.
SO MANY DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES

[Captioner] 19:40:25
 THAT HAVE
CONTRIBUTED TO THE SUCCESS OF

[Captioner] 19:40:29
 FREMONT.
AND I THINK THAT IF

[Captioner] 19:40:32
 I DO FOR ONE GROUP
OVER ANOTHER,

[Captioner] 19:40:35
 WE'RE NEVER GOING TO BE
HAPPY.
AND I THINK

[Captioner] 19:40:39
 THE PART OF IT IS TRYING TO
LOOK AT IT FROM A GLOBAL

[Captioner] 19:40:43
 PERSPECTIVE,
AND BEING

[Captioner] 19:40:46
 FAIR TO HAVE EITHER A

[Captioner] 19:40:47
 FLOATING
HOLIDAY THAT COULD BE DEDICATED FOR ALL


[Captioner] 19:40:51
OF THE ABOVE THAT ARE NOT LISTED IN THE
CALENDAR

[Captioner] 19:40:54
 FOR FREMONT'S CITY EMPLOYEES.


[Captioner] 19:40:58
AND ALSO, THAT IT WOULD

[Captioner] 19:41:01
 ALLOW WHOEVER
NEEDS TO TAKE AN EXTRA DAY, THEY COULD


[Captioner] 19:41:04
TAKE IT ON THAT TIME PERIOD WITHOUT ANY
RESTRICTIONS, AND

[Captioner] 19:41:07
 I THINK THAT WOULD BE
A POSITIVE WAY OF

[Captioner] 19:41:11
 SUPPORTING WHETHER
IT'S LUNAR NEW YEAR, WHETHER IT'S

[Captioner] 19:41:15

DIWALI, WHETHER IT'S RAMADAN, YOU NAME


[Captioner] 19:41:18
ALL THE DIFFERENT HOLIDAYS THAT WOULD BE
OPENED UP

[Captioner] 19:41:21
 FOR EVERY SINGLE PERSON TO BE
ABLE TO UTILIZE

[Captioner] 19:41:25
 THAT AND EVEN FOR EASTER
OR FOR CHRISTIAN

[Captioner] 19:41:29
 HOLIDAYS, SO YOU HAVE A
WIDE VARIETY.
TO PINPOINT

[Captioner] 19:41:32
 TO A PARTICULAR DAY IS SO
HARD, BECAUSE THE

[Captioner] 19:41:35
 DATES DO CHANGE OVER
THE YEARS, AS WE

[Captioner] 19:41:39
 DO KNOW.
THE OTHER PART IS, I'M CONCERNED ABOUT

[Captioner] 19:41:43

THE IMPACT TO THE BUDGET AND THE TIMING

[Captioner] 19:41:46

OF TO BE VERY CAREFUL THAT IF WE HAVE
ONE

[Captioner] 19:41:49
 FLOATING HOLIDAY, THAT IT COULD BE
USED FOR ALL OF THE

[Captioner] 19:41:52
 ABOVE TO SUPPORT
THAT EFFORT AND COMBINE IT

[Captioner] 19:41:56
 AS ONE
COMPLETE PACKAGE.


[Captioner] 19:41:59
THE OTHER PART IS THAT I WANT TO MAKE
SURE, AS WE LOOK AT IT AS

[Captioner] 19:42:03
 A TEAM
FREMONT, THAT WE ARE

[Captioner] 19:42:06
 ALL TOGETHER.
AND HOW WE CAN DO IT AND

[Captioner] 19:42:09
 NOT SEPARATE
OUT DIFFERENT GROUPS.
ONE QUESTION I

[Captioner] 19:42:13
 DID HAVE WAS, WHEN WAS

[Captioner] 19:42:17

THIS REFERRAL SUBMITTED?
DO WE HAVE A DATE ON THAT?


[Captioner] 19:42:22
>> City Mgr. Shackelford: I DON'T KNOW
THE EXACT DATE AT THIS MOMENT, BUT IT'S

[Captioner] 19:42:25

BEEN IN FOR SEVERAL WEEKS.
>> Councilmember Cox: THAT WOULD BE


[Captioner] 19:42:29
BACK IN FEBRUARY?
>> City Mgr. Shackelford:

[Captioner] 19:42:32
 IT PREDATED
THE COUNCIL RETREAT, IF THAT'S YOUR
SPECIFIC QUESTION.


[Captioner] 19:42:36
>> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.
I APPRECIATE THAT

[Captioner] 19:42:39
.
BECAUSE WE DID AGREE BACK ON

[Captioner] 19:42:42
 FEBRUARY
THE 21ST, SO ABOUT 15 DAYS AGO,

[Captioner] 19:42:45
 HERE IN
THIS SAME CHAMBER, WE DID AGREE ON

[Captioner] 19:42:48
 DOING
FLAG RAISING.
AND WE

[Captioner] 19:42:51
 ALL VOTED, THE MOTION WAS PASSED
TO BE ABLE TO

[Captioner] 19:42:55
 DO FIVE CHOSEN

[Captioner] 19:42:58

CELEBRATIONS ALSO THAT WE ALL APPROVED


[Captioner] 19:43:01
AS WELL.
AND WITH THAT, WE DID

[Captioner] 19:43:04
 HAVE STAFF, WE DID
DIRECT STAFF THROUGH THE

[Captioner] 19:43:08
 MOTION THAT WAS
PASSED BY CITY

[Captioner] 19:43:11
 COUNCIL MAJORITY, I
SHOULD SAY THE MAJORITY OF CITY

[Captioner] 19:43:14
 COUNCIL,
THAT WE WOULD ALSO DEFINE WHAT WOULD BE

[Captioner] 19:43:17

THE FLAG RAISING CRITERIA

[Captioner] 19:43:20
, AND DEEP DIVE
IN THAT.
AND I KNOW SINCE

[Captioner] 19:43:23
 WE JUST PASSED ANOTHER
MOTION TO HAVE WORK DONE WITH THE

[Captioner] 19:43:26
 CITY
STAFF 15 DAYS AGO,

[Captioner] 19:43:29
 THAT'S ONE PART ALSO
TO

[Captioner] 19:43:32
 PUT INTO PLACE AND CONSIDER THAT.
THERE'S SO

[Captioner] 19:43:36
 MANY DIFFERENT VENUES OF HOW
TO CELEBRATE

[Captioner] 19:43:39
 THE UNIQUENESS OF EACH
DIFFERENT CULTURE HERE

[Captioner] 19:43:42
 IN FREMONT.
WHETHER IT'S THROUGH

[Captioner] 19:43:46
 THE HOLIDAY LUNAR
NEW YEAR

[Captioner] 19:43:50
 THAT VICE MAYOR KENG HAS
BROUGHT FORTH, WHETHER

[Captioner] 19:43:53
 IT'S USED AS A
FLOATING HOLIDAY, OR THE

[Captioner] 19:43:57
 OTHER PART IS
ALSO WE DO HAVE A FLAG

[Captioner] 19:44:00
 RAISING POLICY
THAT HAS BEEN APPROVED, AND WE

[Captioner] 19:44:03
 JUST ARE
FIGURING OUT

[Captioner] 19:44:06
 WHAT CEREMONIES WOULD BE
ADOPTED

[Captioner] 19:44:10
 BASED ON THE TO BE DETERMINED
CRITERIA.


[Captioner] 19:44:13
SO I DO WANT TO SAY THAT

[Captioner] 19:44:17
 I AM -- TO
DISCLOSE TO THE COMMUNITY THAT I AM A
LIFETIME MEMBER

[Captioner] 19:44:20
 OF CBC, AND ALSO A
LIFETIME MEMBER OF

[Captioner] 19:44:24
 ABAPA, WHICH I HAVE
WORKED MANY, MANY

[Captioner] 19:44:27
 YEARS IN THE ASIAN
COMMUNITY.
BUT IT'S ALL ABOUT

[Captioner] 19:44:30
 WORKING WITH
EVERYBODY'S COMMUNITY.
I CAN GO THROUGH THE LONG LIST OF


[Captioner] 19:44:33
WORKING WITH THE INDIAN COMMUNITY, WITH
THE MUSLIM, WITH ALL THE

[Captioner] 19:44:36
 DIFFERENT
GROUPS OVER THE YEARS

[Captioner] 19:44:39
 THAT IT HELPS MAKE

[Captioner] 19:44:43

FREMONT THE UNIQUE PLACE THAT IT IS.
SO WE'RE TRYING TO CAREFULLY

[Captioner] 19:44:45
 LOOK AT
THIS, VERY OPEN

[Captioner] 19:44:49
 MINDED, BUT EQUAL, THAT
EVERYONE FEELS

[Captioner] 19:44:52
 WELCOMED, EVERYONE FEELS
THAT THERE'S UNITY,

[Captioner] 19:44:56
 BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT
THERE IS UNITY AND DIVERSITY HERE IN

[Captioner] 19:44:59

FREMONT, AND WE KNOW THAT WE WANT TO BE

[Captioner] 19:45:03

ABLE TO WORK WITH EVERYONE AND ALSO MAKE


[Captioner] 19:45:06
SURE THAT EVERYONE FEELS WELCOMED HERE.
WE HAVE ZERO TOLERANCE AS

[Captioner] 19:45:09
 WE ALL KNOW AS
PART OF

[Captioner] 19:45:12
 OUR POLICIES HERE IN FREMONT AS
WELL FOR

[Captioner] 19:45:16
 ANYTHING THAT WOULD BREAK APART
THE COMMUNITY.
SO I KNOW

[Captioner] 19:45:19
 THERE'S A LOT OF CAREFUL
READING IN AND I

[Captioner] 19:45:22
 WOULD LIKE TO HEAR FROM
SOME OF MY OTHER COUNCILMEMBERS, WHAT

[Captioner] 19:45:23

SOME OF THEIR THOUGHTS ARE AS WELL.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:45:28
>> Mayor Mei: NEXT, WE HAVE
COUNCILMEMBER YANG SHAO.


[Captioner] 19:45:34
>> Councilmember Shao: THANK YOU,
MADAME MAYOR.


[Captioner] 19:45:40
I REALLY WELCOME THIS REFERRAL BECAUSE
THE FIRST TIME I HEARD ABOUT THIS IDEA


[Captioner] 19:45:43
WAS FROM MAYOR MEI REFERRING TO A
FLOATING HOLIDAY

[Captioner] 19:45:47
 TO CELEBRATE MULTIPLE
HOLIDAYS

[Captioner] 19:45:50
 COMMONLY CELEBRATED BY THE
DIVERSE COMMUNITY

[Captioner] 19:45:53
 IN FREMONT, AND I'M
GLAD THAT FINAL

[Captioner] 19:45:56
 FINALLY VICE MAYOR KENG
PUT IT IN WRITING.


[Captioner] 19:46:00
I ECHO WHAT HAS BEEN SAID REGARDING

[Captioner] 19:46:03

BEING FAIR AND ALSO BEING COGNITIVE OF

[Captioner] 19:46:06

THE FINANCIAL COST.
TO ME, I THINK

[Captioner] 19:46:09
 THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA
HAS

[Captioner] 19:46:12
 ALREADY SET A VERY GOOD EXAMPLE FOR,
YOU KNOW,

[Captioner] 19:46:16
 SOLVING THAT ISSUE.
I UNDERSTAND THAT EACH

[Captioner] 19:46:19
 ADDITIONAL
HOLIDAY WILL COST THE

[Captioner] 19:46:23
 CITY OVER

[Captioner] 19:46:29
 $240,000
A YEAR.
I ALSO

[Captioner] 19:46:32
 RECOGNIZE THAT FIRST OF ALL, EVEN
AFTER WE ADDED

[Captioner] 19:46:37
 JUNETEENTH HOLIDAY TO

[Captioner] 19:46:40
 ALL
THE EMPLOYEES, STILL

[Captioner] 19:46:44
 SOME LABOR UNIONS
MENTIONED

[Captioner] 19:46:47
 THAT IT DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER
IT A HOLIDAY BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO BE
WORKING ON

[Captioner] 19:46:51
 THAT DAY ANYWAY.


[Captioner] 19:46:54
SO I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT THE CITY

[Captioner] 19:46:58

ALLOWS THE CITY EMPLOYEES TO SELL

[Captioner] 19:47:02
 BACK
ANY UNUSED

[Captioner] 19:47:05
 HOLIDAY OR PTO BACK TO THE
CITY

[Captioner] 19:47:09
 PERIODICALLY.
SO IT'S ALL ABOUT

[Captioner] 19:47:13
 FLEXIBILITY, AND SO I

[Captioner] 19:47:17

AM SUPPORTIVE TO THIS REFERRAL FOR

[Captioner] 19:47:20
 STAFF
TO DO RESEARCH IN A

[Captioner] 19:47:23
 GLOBAL AND
COMPREHENSIVE WAY SO THAT

[Captioner] 19:47:27
 THIS RATHER
THAN BEING

[Captioner] 19:47:30
 EXCLUSIVE TO LUNAR NEW YEAR
CAN ACT AS A

[Captioner] 19:47:34
 PLACEHOLDER FOR HOLIDAY

[Captioner] 19:47:36
 FOR
CELEBRATION OF MANY HOLIDAYS THAT HAVE


[Captioner] 19:47:40
BEEN MENTIONED IN ADDITION TO WHAT I CAN
THINK

[Captioner] 19:47:44
 OF THE HOLIDAYS FOR THE JEWISH
COMMUNITY,

[Captioner] 19:47:47
 FOR THE MUSLIM COMMUNITY, AS
WELL

[Captioner] 19:47:50
 AS SOME OTHER COMMUNITIES.
SO IN THAT

[Captioner] 19:47:54
 CASE, I THINK

[Captioner] 19:47:57
 BASED ON OUR
CURRENT PRACTICE OF BEING ALLOWED

[Captioner] 19:48:02
 -- OF
ALLOWING EMPLOYEES TO

[Captioner] 19:48:05
 SELL BACK THE
HOLIDAYS

[Captioner] 19:48:09
 THEY DON'T USE, THEN THIS

[Captioner] 19:48:13
 CAN
BE DEALT WITH

[Captioner] 19:48:16
 AS MORE OF A

[Captioner] 19:48:19
 LABOR
NEGOTIATION ISSUE TO BE CONSIDERED IN

[Captioner] 19:48:22

FUTURE LABOR NEGOTIATION,

[Captioner] 19:48:25
 TO MINIMIZE
THE COST ON THE CITY SIDE FOR

[Captioner] 19:48:29
 ADDING
THIS PLACEHOLDER OR

[Captioner] 19:48:32
 FLEXIBILITY OR
WHATEVER YOU CALL IT

[Captioner] 19:48:36
, TO ACTUALLY MAKE
EVERYONE HAPPY.


[Captioner] 19:48:39
SO IN SUMMARY, I AM SUPPORTIVE TO THIS

[Captioner] 19:48:42

REFERRAL.


[Captioner] 19:48:46
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN.


[Captioner] 19:48:49
>> Councilmember Kassan: OKAY.
NUMBER ONE,

[Captioner] 19:48:52
 I JUST -- I THINK IT'S
ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL

[Captioner] 19:48:56
 IN THIS CITY OF
AMAZING DIVERSITY THAT WE DO THINGS TO


[Captioner] 19:48:59
RECOGNIZE THAT DIVERSITY.
BUT I'M NOT SURE THAT A CITY HOLIDAY

[Captioner] 19:49:02
 IS THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT BECAUSE

[Captioner] 19:49:04
 IT
REALLY DOESN'T HAVE A HUGE EFFECT ON THE


[Captioner] 19:49:07
MAJORITY OF PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN FREMONT.
IT MIGHT BE NICE FOR OUR

[Captioner] 19:49:12
 EMPLOYEES, BUT
IT'S FOR THE TYPICAL FREMONT RESIDENT,


[Captioner] 19:49:15
THEY MAY NOT EVEN BE AWARE THAT IT'S A
CITY HOLIDAY UNLESS THEY GO

[Captioner] 19:49:18
 TO A CITY
OFFICE TO TRY TO GET THINGS DONE.


[Captioner] 19:49:21
SO I'M NOT SURE THAT ADDING MORE HOL

[Captioner] 19:49:25

HOLIDAYS IS A GREAT WAY TO RECOGNIZE
CULTURAL

[Captioner] 19:49:28
 DIVERSITY.
THERE'S MANY, MANY OTHER WAYS WE CAN DO


[Captioner] 19:49:32
THAT, LIKE HOSTING EVENT LIKE WE DID FOR
THE LUNAR NEW

[Captioner] 19:49:35
 YEAR EVENT.


[Captioner] 19:49:39
AND I DON'T SUPPORT ADDING ANOTHER
FLOATING HOLIDAY.


[Captioner] 19:49:42
I THINK WE ALREADY HAVE A PRETTY DARN
GENEROUS

[Captioner] 19:49:45
 COMPENSATION PACKAGE.
AND YOU KNOW,

[Captioner] 19:49:49
 IF THAT IS WHAT PEOPLE ARE
SAYING, THEN THEY'RE NOT SUPPORTING THIS


[Captioner] 19:49:52
REFERRAL BECAUSE THIS REFERRAL IS
SPECIFICALLY TALKING ABOUT A SPECIFIC
DAY

[Captioner] 19:49:55
 FOR LUNAR NEW YEAR.
SOP IF SOMEBODY WANTED TO BRING A

[Captioner] 19:49:59

DIFFERENT REFERRAL TO ADD A FLOATING
HOLIDAY FOR WHATEVER

[Captioner] 19:50:01
 ANYONE WANTS TO
TAKE TIME OFF FOR, IT SEEMS TO ME THAT


[Captioner] 19:50:04
WOULD NEED TO BE A DIFFERENT REFERRAL.


[Captioner] 19:50:07
I DO WANT TO SAY

[Captioner] 19:50:10
 THAT -- I DON'T WANT
PEOPLE TO THINK THAT THERE'S SOME KIND


[Captioner] 19:50:13
OF DOUBLE STANDARD.
I DID SUPPORT THE JUNETEENTH PAID
HOLIDAY

[Captioner] 19:50:16
 FOR STAFF, AND THE REASON I
THOUGHT THAT WAS APPROPRIATE

[Captioner] 19:50:19
 IS BECAUSE
IT IS A FEDERAL AND STATE PAID HOLIDAY.


[Captioner] 19:50:23
SO IN THOSE CASES, I THINK IT DOES MAKE
SENSE TO THE

[Captioner] 19:50:26
 EXTENT THAT THERE ARE
FEDERAL AND STATE PAID HOLIDAYS.


[Captioner] 19:50:29
I THINK US CONFORMING OUR SCHEDULE FOR
OUR

[Captioner] 19:50:33
 STAFF IS APPROPRIATE, BUT I DO NOT

[Captioner] 19:50:36

SUPPORT ADDING ANOTHER STAFF HOLIDAY.


[Captioner] 19:50:39
I DON'T THINK IT REALLY BENEFITS OUR
COMMUNITY AT ALL.
IF ANYTHING, IT

[Captioner] 19:50:43
 ACTUALLY COULD CAUSE
THEM MORE TROUBLE BECAUSE IT'S YET
ANOTHER DAY THAT THEY

[Captioner] 19:50:45
 CAN'T GET ANYTHING
DONE IN THE CITY OFFICES.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:50:52
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
NEXT IS COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL.
>> Councilmember Campbell: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:50:56
THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS REFERRAL.
I DO THINK

[Captioner] 19:50:59
 THAT IT DOES REPRESENT THE
DIVERSITY

[Captioner] 19:51:03
 OF FREMONT.
SO I KIND OF ECHO EVERYTHING EVERYONE

[Captioner] 19:51:06

HAS ALREADY SAID.
SO I DON'T WANT TO RUN THE

[Captioner] 19:51:09
 RISK OF
REPEATING MYSELF.
SO -- BUT I

[Captioner] 19:51:12
 DO HAVE A QUESTION.
IT LOOKS

[Captioner] 19:51:15
 AS THOUGH RIGHT NOW, THE CITY

[Captioner] 19:51:20

OFFERS 14 PAID HOLIDAYS

[Captioner] 19:51:24
 TO THE CITY
STAFF ALREADY.
AND OF

[Captioner] 19:51:28
 THOSE 14, ONE IS A FLOATING
HOLIDAY.
SO

[Captioner] 19:51:31
 MY QUESTION IS, AND I'M SORRY I
DIDN'T

[Captioner] 19:51:34
 ASK IT BEFOREHAND, BECAUSE I JUST
THOUGHT OF IT AS WE WERE

[Captioner] 19:51:38
 TALKING, THE
14TH ONE IS THE FLOATING HOLIDAY.


[Captioner] 19:51:43
COULD THIS ONE BE USED FOR WHAT

[Captioner] 19:51:46
 WE'VE
JUST HEARD, FOR

[Captioner] 19:51:49
 SEVERAL DIFFERENT
FLOATING HOLIDAYS INCLUDING LUNAR NEW
YEAR?


[Captioner] 19:51:57
>> Councilmember Cox: WHAT IS YOUR
INTENT?
>> Councilmember

[Captioner] 19:51:59
 Campbell: BECAUSE I'M
HEARING SOMEONE SAY ADD ANOTHER FLOATING


[Captioner] 19:52:03
HOLIDAY, BUT I DON'T -- I DON'T GET THAT
THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE ADDING SO THAT

[Captioner] 19:52:06
 THEN
MAKES IT 15?
>> Vice Mayor Keng: IF IT'S A

[Captioner] 19:52:08
 FLOATING
HOLIDAY, THEN IT'S ONE OF THE EXISTING


[Captioner] 19:52:12
DAYS.
SO IF YOU'RE ADDING -- IF WE'RE DECIDING


[Captioner] 19:52:15
TO ADD AN ADDITIONAL PAID HOLIDAY.
SO I THINK

[Captioner] 19:52:19
 EARLIER, I STATED THAT I'M
OPEN TO EITHER

[Captioner] 19:52:23
  ADDING -- BECAUSE
TODAY WE'RE ASKING THE STAFF

[Captioner] 19:52:26
 TO RESEARCH
THE COST

[Captioner] 19:52:30
, IT WOULD IMPLY IF WE'RE ADDING
A PAID HOLIDAY,

[Captioner] 19:52:33
 OR I'M ALSO OPEN TO
HAVING

[Captioner] 19:52:36
 IT AS A -- AS ONE OF THE FLOATING
-- EXISTING

[Captioner] 19:52:40
 FLOATING HOLIDAY THAT PEOPLE
CAN CHOOSE TO TAKE.
>> City Mgr. Shackelford: SO

[Captioner] 19:52:45
 WE
CURRENTLY HAVE ONE FLOATING HOLIDAY, AS


[Captioner] 19:52:48
COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL JUST MENTIONED,
AND THE PURPOSE OF THAT FLOATING HOLIDAY


[Captioner] 19:52:51
IS FOR THINGS JUST LIKE THIS, TO ALLOW

[Captioner] 19:52:55

EMPLOYEES TO TAKE A DAY

[Captioner] 19:52:58
 OFF THAT ISN'T
PRESCRIBED FOR ANYTHING IN

[Captioner] 19:53:01
 PARTICULAR,
LIKE CHRISTMAS OR NEW YEAR'S OR ANYTHING


[Captioner] 19:53:04
LIKE THAT, BUT TO USE IT IN A WAY THAT

[Captioner] 19:53:07

THEY NEED TO AND THAT THEY WANT TO.
SO THAT'S WHAT THE

[Captioner] 19:53:10
 PURPOSE OF THE
FLOATING HOLIDAY IS.


[Captioner] 19:53:14
AND THEN I ALSO WANT TO PIGGY BACK ON A

[Captioner] 19:53:18

COMMENT MADE BY COUNCILMEMBER

[Captioner] 19:53:21
 SHAO, WILL
JUST OFFER A POINT OF CLARIFICATION.
THE CITY

[Captioner] 19:53:24
 ALLOWS EMPLOYEES TO SELL BACK

[Captioner] 19:53:26

THEIR GENERAL LEAVE, A PORTION OF THEIR


[Captioner] 19:53:30
GENERAL LEAVE, BUT HOLIDAYS ARE NOT
SOMETHING THAT

[Captioner] 19:53:33
 WE ALLOW THEM

[Captioner] 19:53:36
 TO GET
PAYBACK FOR.
YOU TAKE IT OR YOU DON'T.


[Captioner] 19:53:41
THANK YOU.
>> Councilmember Campbell: SO QI JUST

[Captioner] 19:53:44

CAN I JUST FINISH UP WITH MY

[Captioner] 19:53:47
 THOUGHT,
PLEASE?
I DON'T THINK I GOT MY QUESTION

[Captioner] 19:53:50

ANSWERED.
NOW THERE IS A FLOATING HOLIDAY

[Captioner] 19:53:54
 ALREADY
ON THE -- AS A PART OF THE

[Captioner] 19:53:58
 BENEFITS.
COULD WE OR

[Captioner] 19:54:01
 DO WE -- MAYBE I SHOULD SAY
DO WE.
DO WE HAVE

[Captioner] 19:54:04
 A LIST OF WHAT THOSE COULD

[Captioner] 19:54:07

BE?
I HEARD YOU SAY THEY COULD

[Captioner] 19:54:11
 TAKE ANYTHING
OUTSIDE OF WHAT'S ON HERE, SO IF

[Captioner] 19:54:14
 AN
EMPLOYEE DECIDED THAT THEY WANTED TO
TAKE A DIWALI

[Captioner] 19:54:17
 DAY, COULD THEY USE THEIR
FLOATING HOLIDAY

[Captioner] 19:54:20
 TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT?
>> City Mgr. Shackelford: YES, THAT'S
WHAT FLOATING HOLIDAY

[Captioner] 19:54:23
 IS.
THEY CAN CHOOSE ANY DAY, ANY WORK TAI
THAT

[Captioner] 19:54:27
 DAY THAT THEY LIKE TO TAKE OFF

[Captioner] 19:54:30
 AND
CELEBRATE WHATEVER OR TAKE CARE OF
WHATEVER THEY'D LIKE TO TAKE

[Captioner] 19:54:34
 CARE.
>> Councilmember Campbell: SO COULD
THIS

[Captioner] 19:54:37
 REFERRAL ALREADY BEEN SOLVED
BECAUSE WE ALREADY HAVE

[Captioner] 19:54:41
 A FLOATING
HOLIDAY?
SO WE'VE SOLVED OUR PROBLEM

[Captioner] 19:54:43
 BEFORE WE
EVEN HAVE TO DO A DEEP DIVE INTO
RESEARCH.


[Captioner] 19:54:47
COULD WE?


[Captioner] 19:54:51
>> City Mgr. Shackelford: WELL, I
THINK THAT'S A QUESTION

[Captioner] 19:54:54
 FOR YOU ALL.
YES, I AGREE, PROBLEM

[Captioner] 19:54:58
 SOLVED, BECAUSE A
FLOATING HOLIDAY ALREADY EXISTS.
>> Councilmember

[Captioner] 19:55:00
 Campbell: ALREADY
EXISTS.
>> City Mgr. Shackelford: BUT, YOU


[Captioner] 19:55:03
KNOW, IT'S REALLY ABOUT THE INTENT OF
VICE MAYOR KENG

[Captioner] 19:55:07
'S REFERRAL IS WHAT YOU
ALL --
>> Mayor Mei: I'LL TURN IT BACK

[Captioner] 19:55:10
 TO
VICE MAYOR KENG BEFORE WE ANSWER THAT.


[Captioner] 19:55:13
>> Vice Mayor Keng: SURE, THANK YOU.
SO THE REASON WHY I KIND

[Captioner] 19:55:16
 OF STARTED THE
DISCUSSION WITH THE CITY MANAGER

[Captioner] 19:55:19
 WAS AT
THE END OF -- ACTUALLY ON THE DAY OF THE

[Captioner] 19:55:23

LUNAR NEW YEAR THIS YEAR, I ACTUALLY
MADE AN APPOINTMENT TO COME

[Captioner] 19:55:26
 IN AND GET
MY iPAD AND THEN HI TO CONFIRM

[Captioner] 19:55:29
 THAT
APPOINTMENT AND SAID ISN'T THIS A NEW

[Captioner] 19:55:33

HOLIDAY?
BECAUSE IT'S NOW A STATE HOLIDAY, THEN 

[Captioner] 19:55:36
I
WAS TOLD, OH, IT'S NOT A CITY HOLIDAY,

[Captioner] 19:55:39

SO WE'RE STILL ALL AT THE OFFICE.
BUT I THINK

[Captioner] 19:55:42
 EARLIER, BEFORE THE COUNCIL
MEETING, ONE OF THE COUNCILMEMBERS

[Captioner] 19:55:46

ACTUALLY ASKED STAFF A QUESTION, WHAT'S

[Captioner] 19:55:49

THE PERCENTAGE OF OUR CITY EMPLOYEES
THAT

[Captioner] 19:55:53
 ARE OF ASIAN AMERICAN ETHNICITY?


[Captioner] 19:55:56
AND I BELIEVE THE ANSWER WAS ABOUT

[Captioner] 19:56:00
 20%,
RIGHT?
SO IT IS ACTUALLY

[Captioner] 19:56:04
 PRETTY SIGNIFICANT
THAT

[Captioner] 19:56:07
 WE HAVE 20% OF CITY EMPLOYEES

[Captioner] 19:56:11
 BEING
ASIAN AMERICAN, BUT YOU KNOW, WHEN WE

[Captioner] 19:56:14

LOOK AT THE PERCENTAGE OF

[Captioner] 19:56:18
 OUR COMMUNITY
MEMBERS AT LARGE, WE ACTUALLY HAVE A
MUCH

[Captioner] 19:56:21
 BIGGER NUMBER.
AND I THINK IN

[Captioner] 19:56:25
 RECOGNIZING THIS LUNAR
NEW YEAR AS A HOLIDAY,

[Captioner] 19:56:28
 IT DOESN'T DETER
ASIAN AMERICANS TO APPLY

[Captioner] 19:56:32
 FOR CITY JOBS
WHEN THEY KNOW THAT THIS

[Captioner] 19:56:35
 IS ALREADY A
RECOGNIZED HOLIDAY AT THE CITY LEVEL.
SO

[Captioner] 19:56:38
 THEY CAN FEEL FREE TO CELEBRATE IT
WITH

[Captioner] 19:56:42
 THEIR FAMILY AND TAKE THAT DAY OFF
WITHOUT, YOU KNOW, KNOWING

[Captioner] 19:56:45
 THAT, OH,
WHAT IF FOUR OTHER PEOPLE WANT

[Captioner] 19:56:48
 TO TAKE
OFF THE SAME DAY, I WON'T BE ABLE TO
TAKE THAT DAY OFF.


[Captioner] 19:56:52
SO THAT'S KIND OF MY INTENTION OF MAKING

[Captioner] 19:56:56

THIS A CITY HOLIDAY, SO

[Captioner] 19:56:59
 TO SPEAK, BUT OF
COURSE WE NEED TO TAKE

[Captioner] 19:57:03
 IN CONSIDERATION
AS EARLIER SEVERAL COUNCILMEMBERS SPOKE


[Captioner] 19:57:06
ABOUT, WELL, WE DON'T WANT -- WE CAN'T
HAVE ANY OTHER

[Captioner] 19:57:10
 GROUP, BUT WE ALSO DID

[Captioner] 19:57:14

DISCUSS ABOUT FLAG RAISING, AND I THINK

[Captioner] 19:57:18

THIS BEING DIFFERENT FROM BEING A

[Captioner] 19:57:21
 FLAG
RAISING IS BECAUSE IT HAD

[Captioner] 19:57:24
 JUST BEEN
PASSED AS A STATE HOLIDAY,

[Captioner] 19:57:28
 AND THAT'S A
DIFFERENT SIGNIFICANCE OF

[Captioner] 19:57:31
 HONORING IT IN
THE CITY

[Captioner] 19:57:35
 CEREMONY, I BELIEVE.
SO I ALSO WANT TO

[Captioner] 19:57:38
 SHARE, WHEN I WAS
GOING TO

[Captioner] 19:57:41
 HIGH SCHOOL, THE ONLY DAY THAT
MY

[Captioner] 19:57:45
 SISTER AND I MISSED SCHOOL WAS

[Captioner] 19:57:48

DURING -- ON LUNAR NEW YEAR, WE ACTUALLY


[Captioner] 19:57:51
HAD -- WE ACTUALLY CALLED THE SCHOOL AND
SAY, OH, WE'RE

[Captioner] 19:57:54
 STAYING HOME TODAY
BECAUSE WE ARE CELEBRATING LUNAR NEW
YEAR.


[Captioner] 19:57:57
SO THAT WAS THE WHOLE -- ONLY

[Captioner] 19:58:00
 DAY OF THE
WHOLE YEAR THAT WE MISSED SCHOOL.
SO I

[Captioner] 19:58:04
 THINK, YOU KNOW, EARLIER, IN THE
PAST

[Captioner] 19:58:07
 FEW WEEKS, WE DID HEAR MANY

[Captioner] 19:58:10

RESIDENT COMING

[Captioner] 19:58:14
 WANTING TO MAKE DIWALI
A CITY HOLIDAY

[Captioner] 19:58:17
 OR HAVE A DAY OFF AT
SCHOOL AND THAT'S A DIFFERENT

[Captioner] 19:58:19
 DECISION
THAT, YOU KNOW, THE SCHOOL BOARD HAS TO


[Captioner] 19:58:23
MAKE.
BUT I DO SHARE THAT SENTIMENT AS WELL

[Captioner] 19:58:26
 AS
THE EARLIER COMMENTS FROM COUNCILMEMBER

[Captioner] 19:58:29

SALWAN.
IF WE ALSO WANT

[Captioner] 19:58:33
 TO CONSIDER ADDING OTHER
SIGNIFICANT

[Captioner] 19:58:37
 HOLIDAYS AT THE SAME TIME,
AND I THINK THAT

[Captioner] 19:58:40
 I WILL WELCOME THAT,
YOU KNOW, WHEN

[Captioner] 19:58:43
 WE DISCUSS FURTHER IF --
BECAUSE WE

[Captioner] 19:58:47
 WANT TO RECOGNIZE, WE DO ALSO
HAVE A

[Captioner] 19:58:50
 LARGE INDIAN COMMUNITY THAT
CELEBRATES DIWALI,

[Captioner] 19:58:54
 PROBABLY ONE OF
THE -- YOU KNOW, WHEN WE LOOK AT OUR
STUDENTS IN

[Captioner] 19:58:57
 OUR SCHOOLS, YOU SEE MANY OF
OUR STUDENTS

[Captioner] 19:59:00
 ARE CELEBRATING DIWALI.


[Captioner] 19:59:04
SO I WELCOME THAT, AND I WELCOME OTHER
COMMENTS AS WELL.


[Captioner] 19:59:08
>> Mayor Mei: I THINK STAFF HAS A
CLARIFICATION THEY'D LIKE TO SHARE.


[Captioner] 19:59:11
CITY MANAGER WOULD LIKE TO SHARE.
>> City Mgr. Shackelford: YES, THANK
YOU.


[Captioner] 19:59:14
I JUST WANTED TO OFFER SOME

[Captioner] 19:59:18
 CLARITY ON
THE 20% OF OUR CITY STAFF

[Captioner] 19:59:21
 POPULATION
THAT IDENTIFIES AS ASIAN

[Captioner] 19:59:25
.


[Captioner] 19:59:29
I WANT TO CLARIFY THAT IT DOESN'T
DIFFERENTIATE

[Captioner] 19:59:32
 FROM ASIAN AND FAR EAST
INDIAN.
SO

[Captioner] 19:59:35
 IT'S ALL ONE GROUPING,

[Captioner] 19:59:39
 SO TO YOUR
POINT ABOUT THE DIWALI HOLIDAY AND

[Captioner] 19:59:42
 LUNAR
NEW YEAR, YOU KNOW, EVERYONE'S INCLUDED


[Captioner] 19:59:45
IN THAT 20%.


[Captioner] 19:59:50
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
NEXT ON THE QUEUE,

[Captioner] 19:59:53
 I HAVE COUNCILMEMBER
SALWAN.


[Captioner] 20:00:02
>> Councilmember Salwan: THANK YOU,
MADAME MAYOR.
QUESTION FOR THE

[Captioner] 20:00:05
 STAFF.
SO WHAT WOULD

[Captioner] 20:00:09
 HAPPEN, WOULD STAFF BE
LOOKING AT OTHER DAYS OR SHOULD WE JUST

[Captioner] 20:00:13

SUGGEST THEM NOW?
WHAT'S THE EASIEST?


[Captioner] 20:00:23
>> City Mgr. Shackelford: WELL, THE
EASIEST WOULD BE TO FOCUS ON THE

[Captioner] 20:00:26

FLOATING HOLIDAY AND CONTINUE TO ALLOW


[Captioner] 20:00:29
OUR STAFF TO USE THAT IN A WAY IN WHICH

[Captioner] 20:00:32

THEY THINK OR FEEL IS APPROPRIATE FOR
THEMSELVES AND THEIR

[Captioner] 20:00:35
 FAMILIES.
AS FAR AS ANY RESEARCH IS

[Captioner] 20:00:39
 CONCERNED, YOU
KNOW, STAFF CAN COME BACK AND LET YOU
KNOW

[Captioner] 20:00:43
 WHAT THE COST OF AN

[Captioner] 20:00:46
 EIGHT-HOUR
HOLIDAY WOULD BE.
I WOULD ASK THAT YOU

[Captioner] 20:00:49
 ALL KEEP IN MIND
THAT FOR OUR ESSENTIAL

[Captioner] 20:00:53
 SERVICES, AS
PEOPLE TAKE THESE DAYS OFF, THAT MEANS


[Captioner] 20:00:57
SOMEONE HAS TO BACKFILL THEIR POSITION,

[Captioner] 20:01:00

VERY LIKELY ON OVERTIME, SO THERE'S SOME

[Captioner] 20:01:04

HIDDEN COSTS THERE AS WELL.


[Captioner] 20:01:07
SO AS FAR AS WHAT DAYS TO CONSIDER OR
HOW MANY

[Captioner] 20:01:10
 DAYS TO CONSIDER, STAFF

[Captioner] 20:01:14
 DOESN'T
HAVE ANY RECOMMENDATION THERE, BUT WE
CAN LET

[Captioner] 20:01:17
 YOU KNOW HOW MUCH OF A COST FOR
AN

[Captioner] 20:01:20
 EIGHT-HOUR HOLIDAY CITYWIDE.
>> Councilmember Salwan: WELL, I DON'T


[Captioner] 20:01:23
WANT TO SPEND ANY MONEY ON FIGURING OUT
HOW MUCH THINGS ARE GOING TO COST


[Captioner] 20:01:27
BECAUSE I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD BE
GIVING MORE HOLIDAYS.
SO I THINK

[Captioner] 20:01:30
 WE JUST KEEP THE FLOATING
HOLIDAY.
AND WHAT

[Captioner] 20:01:33
 I'M HEARING FROM COUNCILMEMBER
KENG IS IT'S MORE THE

[Captioner] 20:01:36
 RECOGNITION OF THE
COMMUNITY ARRIVING

[Captioner] 20:01:41
 AND FINALLY THEY'VE
BEEN RECOGNIZED.
I THINK THAT'S WHAT A LOT

[Captioner] 20:01:44
 OF IMMIGRANT
COMMUNITIES ARE LOOKING FOR, IS A
VALIDATION THAT, YES, WE

[Captioner] 20:01:47
 ARE HERE, WE
ARE AMERICAN AND WE ARE ALSO BEING
CELEBRATED, AND I

[Captioner] 20:01:50
 THINK LEUL NAR NEW
YEAR IS A GOOD RECOGNITION OF THAT.
SO I THINK

[Captioner] 20:01:54
 WE SHOULD DEFINITELY
RECOGNIZE THIS

[Captioner] 20:01:58
 AS A DAY THAT THE CITY
CAN GET BEHIND,

[Captioner] 20:02:01
 BUT IT SHOULD NOT BE AT
TAXPAYER

[Captioner] 20:02:04
 EXPENSE, IT SHOULD NOT BE A
PAID HOLIDAY.
IT COULD BE A

[Captioner] 20:02:08
 FLOATING HOLIDAY.
ALSO WE'VE HAD SEVERAL SPEAKERS

[Captioner] 20:02:11
 COME IN
FOR THE LAST FEW WEEKS FOR GALLEY,

[Captioner] 20:02:13
 AND I
THINK FOR A LOT OF THEM, THAT'S A VERY


[Captioner] 20:02:17
IMPORTANT RECOGNITION DAY FOR THEM AS
WELL, AND AGAIN, IT SHOULD NOT BE A

[Captioner] 20:02:21
 PAID
HOLIDAY.
SO I WOULD -- I

[Captioner] 20:02:24
 COULD GET BEHIND A
MOTION WHERE WE

[Captioner] 20:02:28
 HAVE STAFF RECOGNIZE

[Captioner] 20:02:31

THESE DAYS AND ALLOW STAFF TO

[Captioner] 20:02:34
 USE THESE
AS FLOATING HOLIDAYS WITHOUT

[Captioner] 20:02:37
 ANY FURTHER
EXPENSE.
AND WITHOUT ANY FURTHER STUDIES.


[Captioner] 20:02:41
I KNOW CITIES LOVE STUDIES, WHICH COST A
LOT OF MONEY.


[Captioner] 20:02:44
AND SO THOSE ARE THE TWO THAT I CAN GET
BEHIND.


[Captioner] 20:02:47
I KNOW THERE MIGHT BE MORE, BUT I'M OPEN
TO

[Captioner] 20:02:51
 MY COLLEAGUES AND SEE WHAT THEY THINK

[Captioner] 20:02:54
.
>> Mayor Mei: I KNOW WE'VE HAD MANY
DIFFERENT SPEAKERS AND AS A CITY

[Captioner] 20:02:57
 THAT
HAS INCREDIBLE DIVERSITY, THAT CELEBRATE


[Captioner] 20:03:01
WHETHER IT'S THE DIFFERENT NEW YEARS AND

[Captioner] 20:03:03

NOWRUZ BEING THE FESTIVAL FOR SPRING AS


[Captioner] 20:03:07
WELL AS WITH US WITH DIWALI AND THESE
OTHER

[Captioner] 20:03:10
 HOLIDAYS.
WHAT I'VE HEARD THE OTHER DAY WHEN WE
HAD MANY, MANY DIFFERENT

[Captioner] 20:03:13
 SPEAKERS, IN
PARTICULAR, OUR UTE WAS

[Captioner] 20:03:17
 THE IMPACT, AND
SO WE

[Captioner] 20:03:20
 DO HAVE A SUBCOMMITTEE

[Captioner] 20:03:24
 -- I THINK
THAT IS ONE OF THE GREATEST IMPACTS

[Captioner] 20:03:26
 AND
OVER THE YEARS I KNOW EVEN FOR THE START


[Captioner] 20:03:29
OF SCHOOL, THERE HAS BEEN SENSITIVITY
FOR DIFFERENT HOLIDAYS, WHETHER

[Captioner] 20:03:33
 IT'S THE
ROSH A SHANNA

[Captioner] 20:03:36
 OR OTHER ONES WE'VE TRIED
TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION.
SO IN TERMS OF THE

[Captioner] 20:03:40
 SCHOOL IMPACTS AND
CHILDREN AND FAMILIES THAT MIGHT BE THE

[Captioner] 20:03:42

BETTER PLACE.
I DO LIKE THE IDEA OF THE FLOATING


[Captioner] 20:03:45
HOLIDAYS BUT I THINK -- PEOPLE DON'T
REALIZE IT'S NOT JUST

[Captioner] 20:03:49
 THE ONE DAY, IT'S
THE SCALABILITY AND THE

[Captioner] 20:03:52
 FACT THAT IT
WILL BE IMPACTED AND NOT TO MENTION EVEN


[Captioner] 20:03:55
WHEN WE APPROVED THE OTHER DATES, IT

[Captioner] 20:03:57

ALWAYS HAS TO COME BACK TO NEGOTIATIONS


[Captioner] 20:04:00
WITH OUR LABOR GROUPS, WHICH ACTUALLY
TOOK A SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNT

[Captioner] 20:04:04
 OF TIME AND
IT'S NOT ACCOUNTED INTO

[Captioner] 20:04:07
 THE

[Captioner] 20:04:10
 240,000.
SO I DON'T NO IF THERE'S INTEREST FROM


[Captioner] 20:04:14
THE MOTION MAKER

[Captioner] 20:04:17
 OF THE REFERRAL, VICE
MAYOR KENG, DO YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS

[Captioner] 20:04:19
 ON
THIS?
>> Vice Mayor Keng: YES, THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:04:23
SO I AM HAPPY TO MODIFY THIS REFERRAL
FOR THE CITY BECAUSE WE

[Captioner] 20:04:26
 ACTUALLY HAVE
BEEN HE HEARING FROM

[Captioner] 20:04:28
 MANY INDIAN
COMMUNITY MEMBERS THAT THEY REALLY WANT


[Captioner] 20:04:31
DIWALI TO BE A CITY HOLIDAY, WHETHER

[Captioner] 20:04:35

IT'S -- WELL, THEY WANTED AT LEAST A
FLAG RAISING, BUT I THINK REALLY

[Captioner] 20:04:38
 IT'S AT
THE LEVEL OF LUNAR NEW YEAR AS WELL, SO


[Captioner] 20:04:42
I'M HAPPY TO MODIFY THIS REFERRAL

[Captioner] 20:04:45
 FOR
THE CITY TO ALLOW THE EMPLOYEES TO TAKE

[Captioner] 20:04:49

LUNAR NEW YEAR AND DIWALI AS PART

[Captioner] 20:04:52
 OF
THEIR FLOATING HOLIDAYS, AND THAT WAY WE


[Captioner] 20:04:55
RECOGNIZE BOTH OF THESE VERY IMPORTANT
CULTURAL HOLIDAYS, BECAUSE I

[Captioner] 20:04:58
 WAS
ACTUALLY ON THE PHONE WITH

[Captioner] 20:05:01
 ONE OF THE
LEADERS AND THEY WERE SAYING, YOU

[Captioner] 20:05:04
 KNOW,
DIWALI IS LIKE THEIR CHRISTMAS, THEY GET


[Captioner] 20:05:08
ONE OR TWO WEEKS OFF.
SO IT IS THE BIGGEST HOLIDAY

[Captioner] 20:05:11
 FOR THE
INDIAN COMMUNITY.
SO I'M HAPPY TO MODIFY

[Captioner] 20:05:15
 THAT MOTION FOR
THE CITY TO RECOGNIZE

[Captioner] 20:05:18
 THESE TWO HOLIDAYS
AS A FLOATING

[Captioner] 20:05:21
 HOLIDAY AND WE DON'T NEED
TO HAVE

[Captioner] 20:05:25
 FURTHER RESEARCH AS
COUNCILMEMBER

[Captioner] 20:05:28
 SALWAN.
>> JUST AGAIN I WAS GOING TO TURN TO

[Captioner] 20:05:31
 THE
CITY MANAGER FOR A POINT OF

[Captioner] 20:05:34

CLARIFICATION.
RIGHT NOW THE FLOATING HOLIDAY IS TO


[Captioner] 20:05:38
THEIR INDIVIDUAL SELF-DETERMINATION BUT
IF YOU

[Captioner] 20:05:41
 CAN -- AS WE MENTIONED TWO WEEKS
AGO TO TALK ABOUT FLAG RAISING AND THE

[Captioner] 20:05:43

ADDITIONAL DATES AND POSSIBLY ROTATING


[Captioner] 20:05:45
THROUGH THAT.
THAT WOULD BE AN OPTION TO ENSURE THAT


[Captioner] 20:05:48
WE HAVE REPRESENTATION THAT'S

[Captioner] 20:05:52
 NEEDED
ACROSS ALL OF OUR FUNT -- IF WE START
WITH ONE,

[Captioner] 20:05:55
 I THINK WE WELCOME SO MANY
OTHERS TOO.


[Captioner] 20:05:59
>> City Mgr. Shackelford: YOU NAILED
IT, MAYOR.
YOU TOOK THE WORDS RIGHT OUT OF MY


[Captioner] 20:06:03
MOUTH.
>> Mayor Mei: SO COUNCILMEMBER
CAMPBELL?


[Captioner] 20:06:06
I SAW COUNCILMEMBER SHAO TOO.
>> Councilmember Campbell: I DID HAVE
MY HAND RAISED.


[Captioner] 20:06:10
I JUST WANTED TO COMMENT ON A

[Captioner] 20:06:13
 STATEMENT
THAT COUNCILMEMBER KENG

[Captioner] 20:06:16
 MADE ABOUT BEING
RECOGNIZED.


[Captioner] 20:06:20
DID THE CITY, FOR THE LUNAR NEW YEAR
CELEBRATION THAT THE

[Captioner] 20:06:23
 CITY HOSTED AT THE
EVENT

[Captioner] 20:06:27
 CENTER, WAS THAT A COST INCURRED
BY THE CITY OR WAS THAT A COST

[Captioner] 20:06:31
 INCURRED
BY A PARTNERSHIP?


[Captioner] 20:06:36
>> City Mgr. Shackelford: THAT WAS A
COST INCURRED BY THE

[Captioner] 20:06:39
 CITY, PRE-FUNDED.
>> Councilmember Campbell: I SEE.
OKAY.


[Captioner] 20:06:44
SO IN OTHER WORDS, THE LUNAR NEW YEAR

[Captioner] 20:06:48

CELEBRATION ALREADY HAS A COST
ASSOCIATED WITH IT.


[Captioner] 20:06:51
I DIDN'T KNOW IF IT'S GOING TO BE

[Captioner] 20:06:54
 AN
ANNUAL THING OR WAS IT JUST SOMETHING
THAT WE DID ONE

[Captioner] 20:06:57
 TIME?
>> Mayor Mei: I'LL PROVIDE SOME
BACKGROUND TO THAT.


[Captioner] 20:07:01
NORMALLY IN THE PAST, WE'VE HAD AT THAT
TIME PERIOD, WE USUALLY HAVE

[Captioner] 20:07:04
 A KITE
VESTIVELY, AND THERE WERE SOME

[Captioner] 20:07:08
 IMPACTS
ON THE COST OF KITES GETTING CAUGHT UP


[Captioner] 20:07:11
INTO OUR TREES AND OTHER THINGS.
SO THIS YEAR IT WAS

[Captioner] 20:07:14
 ROTATED TO A
DIFFERENT HOLIDAY TO' LOW US SOME
DIFFERENT OPTIONS.


[Captioner] 20:07:17
SO IT'S NOT A FIXED HOLIDAY

[Captioner] 20:07:20
 BUT I KNOW
WE DID HAVE SOME SPONSORSHIPS, SO
WHETHER IT'S FOR

[Captioner] 20:07:24
 THIS HOLIDAY AND
OTHERS, IT'S SOMETHING WE'RE ENCOURAGING


[Captioner] 20:07:27
OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS TO PARTNER WITH

[Captioner] 20:07:29

US, I THINK THAT MAKES IT RICHER TO HAVE


[Captioner] 20:07:32
THE SUPPORT OF THE PARTNERSHIPS AND WE
HAVE SO MANY CIVIC,

[Captioner] 20:07:35
 ETHNIC AND CULTURAL
GROUPS IN OUR COMMUNITY WHICH WE'RE
BLESSED TO HAVE

[Captioner] 20:07:38
 AS PARTNERS.
>> City Mgr. Shackelford: PLEASE, JUST


[Captioner] 20:07:41
A MOMENT, PLEASE, AND MY STAFF IS
CORRECTING ME, SO I NEED TO

[Captioner] 20:07:44
 OFFER THIS
CLARIFICATION.
BUT SHE'S TELLING ME

[Captioner] 20:07:47
 THAT THE LUNAR NEW
YEAR

[Captioner] 20:07:51
 EVENT WAS FOUNDED BY A
SPONSORSHIP.


[Captioner] 20:07:54
>> Councilmember Campbell: OKAY.
>>

[Captioner] 20:07:57
 NO TAXPAYER DOLLARS.
>> THAT MAKES

[Captioner] 20:08:00
 IT BETTER.
I'M IN SUPPORT OF THE FLOATING

[Captioner] 20:08:04
 HOLIDAY
BEING WHATEVER EMPLOYEES DECIDED

[Captioner] 20:08:06
 THEY
WOULD LIKE TO DO, WHETHER IT'S DIWALI,


[Captioner] 20:08:09
LUNAR NEW YEAR OR ANY OF THE OTHER
CELEBRATIONS THEY'D LIKE.


[Captioner] 20:08:13
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:08:16
>> Mayor Mei: COUNCILMEMBER SHAO WAS
NEXT, AND THEN

[Captioner] 20:08:19
 COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL, I
THINK YOU JUMPED IN, THEN COUNCILMEMBER

[Captioner] 20:08:23

COX.
>> Councilmember Campbell: ACTUALLY

[Captioner] 20:08:26
 MY
BUTTON BLINKING.
>> Mayor Mei: YOU ARE

[Captioner] 20:08:29
 AND NOW ACTUALLY
--
>>

[Captioner] 20:08:33
 I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR A WHILE SO HOW
DO I MAKE THIS GO

[Captioner] 20:08:36
 OFF?
JUST PUSH OFF?
>> Mayor Mei: YES, YOU

[Captioner] 20:08:39
 POPPED OFF A
SECOND TIME TOO

[Captioner] 20:08:43
.
>> TAKE ME OFF, PLEASE

[Captioner] 20:08:46
.
I THINK WE'VE MADE A

[Captioner] 20:08:49
 DECISION.
I FEEL LIKE WE'VE JOKED ABOUT THE PHRASE


[Captioner] 20:08:52
WE USE ELMO ENOUGH, LET'S MOVE ON.
>> Councilmember

[Captioner] 20:08:55
 Shao: I TRIED TO MAKE
MYSELF CONCISE.
I THINK RIGHT

[Captioner] 20:08:59
 NOW THE BOILING POINT IS
WHETHER

[Captioner] 20:09:02
 IT'S THE EXISTING FLOATING
HOLIDAY OR AN

[Captioner] 20:09:05
 ADDITIONAL FLOATING
HOLIDAY.
I DON'T THINK WE

[Captioner] 20:09:08
 HAVE TO JUST TRY TO
COME TO THE SOLUTION TODAY.


[Captioner] 20:09:11
THIS REFERRAL IS TO ASK THE STAFF TO DO
RESEARCH.


[Captioner] 20:09:15
WE HAVE SO MANY PRESIDENTS IN FRONT

[Captioner] 20:09:18
 OF
US, TO

[Captioner] 20:09:21
 THE EX-ZESTING POLICY AT THE
STATE

[Captioner] 20:09:24
 LEVEL THAT THE PRESIDENT OF CBC
JUST READ US A

[Captioner] 20:09:28
 LONG LIST OF CITIES WHO
ALREADY DID

[Captioner] 20:09:31
 THAT RECENTLY.
AND IT

[Captioner] 20:09:34
 WILL BE INTERESTING AT LEAST TO
ME TO FIND

[Captioner] 20:09:37
 OUT WHAT THE PRACTICE OF THE
STATE

[Captioner] 20:09:40
 AND OTHER CITIES REGARDING THIS

[Captioner] 20:09:44

ISSUE.


[Captioner] 20:09:48
I'M SURE BEFORE THIS YEAR, EITHER
AT THE CITY LEVELS OF

[Captioner] 20:09:51
 ALL THE CITIES OR
THE STATE LEVEL, THEY ALREADY

[Captioner] 20:09:55
 ENJOY THE
FLOATING HOLIDAY.
IT'S NOT SOMETHING NEW, IT'S

[Captioner] 20:09:58
 NOT A NEW
CONCEPT.
SO MY QUESTION STILL

[Captioner] 20:10:03
 REMAINS WHETHER
WE'RE REFERRING TO AN ADDITIONAL

[Captioner] 20:10:06

FLOATING HOLIDAY TO

[Captioner] 20:10:10
 RECOGNIZE LUNAR NEW
YEAR, DIWALI, AS WELL AS

[Captioner] 20:10:13
 MANY OTHER
IMPORTANT HOLIDAYS, OR ARE WE JUST

[Captioner] 20:10:16
 USING
THE EXISTING ONE?
SO

[Captioner] 20:10:20
 I SUPPORT THIS REFERRAL FOR STAFF TO
DO SOME RESEARCH

[Captioner] 20:10:23
 TO FIND OUT WHAT THE
PRACTICE OF THE STATE

[Captioner] 20:10:25
 AND OTHER CITY
GOVERNMENTS ARE DOING.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:10:32
>> Mayor Mei: COUNCILMEMBER COX.
>> Councilmember Cox: THANK YOU

[Captioner] 20:10:35
.


[Captioner] 20:10:39
ONE CLARIFICATION IF I COULD ASK THE
CITY MANAGER MAYBE A

[Captioner] 20:10:43
 OR DEFER TO.


[Captioner] 20:10:46
DEFINED IN OUR HUMAN RESOURCE

[Captioner] 20:10:49
 HANDBOOK,
THE FLOATING HOLIDAY, ARE THERE ANY
OTHER RESTRICTIONS OR

[Captioner] 20:10:52
 IS IT JUST A FLAT
OUT PAID OL HOLIDAY?


[Captioner] 20:10:56
I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT'S CLEAR,
BECAUSE I'M NOT CLEAR

[Captioner] 20:10:59
 ON -- WE HAVE IN
FRONT OF US THE REFERRAL THAT'S SAYING

[Captioner] 20:11:02

PAID HOLIDAY.
BUT IT DOESN'T SAY FLOATING

[Captioner] 20:11:06
 HOLIDAY
UNTIL VICE MAYOR

[Captioner] 20:11:10
 KENG KIND OF CLARIFIES
THAT, WHAT WE'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO

[Captioner] 20:11:13
 BE
VOTING ON.
BUT FROM THE

[Captioner] 20:11:17
 HANDBOOK, ARE THERE ANY
RESTRICTIONS ON THE FLOATING HOLIDAY
WHEN

[Captioner] 20:11:20
 AN EMPLOYEE COMES TO CITY OF
FREMONT, IF YOU COULD KIND OF JUST

[Captioner] 20:11:23
 SHARE
THAT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE UNDERSTAND
FLOATING

[Captioner] 20:11:26
 HOLIDAYS THE SAME UNDERSTANDING

[Captioner] 20:11:29
.
>> City Mgr. Shackelford: IT EIGHT
HOURS OF LEAVE

[Captioner] 20:11:33
 AVAILABLE TO EACH
EMPLOYEE TO

[Captioner] 20:11:36
 USE HOWEVER AND WHENEVER
THEY'D LIKE TO.


[Captioner] 20:11:40
NO RESTRICTIONS.


[Captioner] 20:11:43
>> Councilmember Cox: DO THEY HAVE TO
USE IT BY THE END OF THE YEAR?
>> City Mgr. Shackelford:

[Captioner] 20:11:46
 WELL, THAT
WOULD BE ONE RESTRICTION.
SO YEAH, THESE ARE CALENDAR

[Captioner] 20:11:49
 YEAR
HOLIDAYS, SO THEY'D HAVE TO USE IT

[Captioner] 20:11:53

WITHIN THE CALENDAR YEAR.
KOCH

[Captioner] 20:11:56
 COX OKAY, SO THERE'S NO CARRYOVER
IS THE ONLY EXCEPTION?


[Captioner] 20:12:00
>> City Mgr. Shackelford: CORRECT.
>> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.
THANK YOU FOR THAT CLARIFICATION.


[Captioner] 20:12:03
>> Mayor Mei: I'M JUST GOING TO MAKE A
MOTION BECAUSE I THINK WE'VE

[Captioner] 20:12:05
 HEARD
ENOUGH GOING AROUND.
>> Councilmember Campbell: SHE HAD


[Captioner] 20:12:08
ALREADY MADE A MOTION?
>> Mayor Mei: THAT WE'RE JUST GOING TO


[Captioner] 20:12:11
KEEP WITH THE OPTION OF USING THE
FLEXIBLE DAY.
TERESA

[Captioner] 20:12:14
 KENG, I THINK.
VICE MAYOR.
OKAY.


[Captioner] 20:12:17
>> Councilmember Campbell: NOW WE HAVE
A SECOND.
LET'S VOTE

[Captioner] 20:12:21
.
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: THROUGH THE
CHAIR BEFORE WE VOTE, I THINK

[Captioner] 20:12:24
 THE
QUESTION STILL REMAINS WHETHER WE'RE
TALKING ABOUT ADDING A

[Captioner] 20:12:28
 FLOATING HOLIDAY
VERSUS ESSENTIALLY MAINTAINING

[Captioner] 20:12:31
 THE
STATUS QUO.
MY UNDERSTANDING OF VICE MAYOR

[Captioner] 20:12:34
 KENG'S
PROPOSAL IS TO ADD A FLOATING HOLIDAY.


[Captioner] 20:12:37
INTO THAT

[Captioner] 20:12:41
THAT CAN BE USED
FOR LUNAR NEW

[Captioner] 20:12:44
 YEAR.
>> Vice Mayor Keng: TO RESEARCH THE
COST -- I'VE HEARD

[Captioner] 20:12:47
 THAT -- SORRY, MAY I
SPEAK NOW?
>> Mayor Mei:

[Captioner] 20:12:50
 YES.
>> Vice Mayor Keng: SO I HAVE HEARD
SOME COMMENTS OF CONCERNS OF COST.


[Captioner] 20:12:54
SO IF WE ARE ADDING ANOTHER FLOATING

[Captioner] 20:12:58

HOLIDAY, WHICH CAN

[Captioner] 20:13:01
 USED FOR EITHER
LUNAR NEW YEAR OR DIWALI,

[Captioner] 20:13:04
 I THINK THAT
WOULD BE MORE WORKABLE.


[Captioner] 20:13:08
BUT I AM OPEN TO HAVING STAFF

[Captioner] 20:13:11
 RESEARCH
AS COUNCILMEMBER SHAO EARLIER

[Captioner] 20:13:15
 COMMENTED
THAT -- AND THE COST

[Captioner] 20:13:18
 OF ADDITIONAL
FLOATING HOLIDAY, SINCE WE DO

[Captioner] 20:13:21
 HAVE
COSTS -- WELL, COST CONCERN BUT THEN WE

[Captioner] 20:13:24

ALSO WANT TO MAKE -- WE ALSO WANT

[Captioner] 20:13:28
 TO
COMBINE THE DIFFERENT HOLIDAYS TO GIVE


[Captioner] 20:13:31
PEOPLE THAT FLEXIBILITY, WE DON'T WANT
PEOPLE TO KEEP COMING BACK AND SAY

[Captioner] 20:13:35
 OKAY,
I WANT TO ADD THIS DAY, THIS DAY AND NOT

[Captioner] 20:13:38

BE FAIR TO OTHERS.


[Captioner] 20:13:42
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: AND TO BE
CLEAR, THIS IS THE DIRECTION FOR

[Captioner] 20:13:45
 STAFF
TO RESEARCH, THIS IS NOT ADDING ANY
HOLIDAYS.


[Captioner] 20:13:48
>> Mayor Mei: YES, TO RESEARCH.
>> City Mgr. Shackelford: TO RESEARCH

[Captioner] 20:13:51

WHAT EXACTLY?
WE CURRENTLY HAVE

[Captioner] 20:13:54
 A FLOATING HOLIDAY
THAT CAN BE USED FOR

[Captioner] 20:13:58
 LUNAR NEW YEAR,
DIWALI, ANYTHING.


[Captioner] 20:14:03
THAT CITY STAFF WOULD LIKE TO USE THAT
DAY FOR.
IN ADDITION TO THE

[Captioner] 20:14:06
 VERY GENEROUS LEAVE
BANK THAT -- LEAVE BANKS

[Captioner] 20:14:10
 THAT WE HAVE
HERE IN THE CITY OF FREMONT.


[Captioner] 20:14:13
SO I NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT EXACTLY IT

[Captioner] 20:14:16

IS THAT YOU WANT STAFF TO

[Captioner] 20:14:20
 RESEARCH,
BECAUSE I'D HATE TO SEND STAFF OFF

[Captioner] 20:14:23
 ON AN
UNNECESSARY RESEARCH MISSION WHEN WE

[Captioner] 20:14:26

ALREADY HAVE SOMETHING IN EXISTENCE.


[Captioner] 20:14:30
>> Vice Mayor Keng: UNDERSTOOD.
SO I

[Captioner] 20:14:33
 ACTUALLY HAVE

[Captioner] 20:14:36
 HEARD MORE COMMENT
THAT WE DON'T WANT TO

[Captioner] 20:14:39
 INCUR ADDITIONAL
COSTS, RIGHT?


[Captioner] 20:14:43
SO -- BUT I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO

[Captioner] 20:14:46

RECOGNIZE NOT

[Captioner] 20:14:49
 JUST OUR CURRENT STATUS,
WE CAN TAKE ANY

[Captioner] 20:14:53
 DAY -- ANY FLOATING
HOLIDAY ANY DAY

[Captioner] 20:14:57
 AND NOT RECOGNIZING THIS
IMPORTANT HOLIDAY

[Captioner] 20:15:00
 AS OTHERWISE
ASSEMBLYMEMBER LOWE DIDN'T HAVE TO

[Captioner] 20:15:04

PROPOSE THIS NEW HOLIDAY AND GOVERNOR
NEWSOM DIDN'T HAVE

[Captioner] 20:15:07
 TO SIGN INTO BILL TO
RECOGNIZE LUNAR NEW

[Captioner] 20:15:10
 YEAR AS A HOLIDAY.
TO RECOGNIZE THE

[Captioner] 20:15:13
 API COMMUNITY.
SO I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT THAT

[Captioner] 20:15:16
 WE
SPECIFY

[Captioner] 20:15:22
 THAT WE ARE RECOGNIZING THESE
TWO HOLIDAYS FOR THE CITY

[Captioner] 20:15:25
 STAFF.
>> City Mgr. Shackelford: SO THAT,
THEN, WOULD NOT BE A FLOATING

[Captioner] 20:15:28
 HOLIDAY.
THAT WOULD

[Captioner] 20:15:32
 BE -- YOU KNOW, LABELING

[Captioner] 20:15:36
 IT
AS EIGHT

[Captioner] 20:15:39
 HOURS TO CELEBRATE EITHER LUNAR
NEW YEAR OR

[Captioner] 20:15:43
 DIWALI.
SO THAT'S

[Captioner] 20:15:46
 NOT THE DEFINITION OF A
FLOATING HOLIDAY.
THAT'S PRESCRIBING

[Captioner] 20:15:50
 DAYS TO AN ADDITIONAL
EIGHT HOURS OR PRESCRIBING

[Captioner] 20:15:53
 A HOLIDAY TO
THOSE ADDITIONAL EIGHT HOURS.
SO THAT'S

[Captioner] 20:15:56
 KIND OF BACK TO YOUR ORIGINAL
REFERRAL.


[Captioner] 20:16:00
>> Vice Mayor Keng: RIGHT.
SO MY ORIGINAL REFERRAL OF HAVING A

[Captioner] 20:16:03
 PAID
HOLIDAY,

[Captioner] 20:16:07
 I DID WANT TO HAVE -- THAT
WOULD BE IDEAL, BUT OF

[Captioner] 20:16:11
 COURSE
CONSIDERING THE

[Captioner] 20:16:14
 COSTS TO ANOTHER
ADDITIONAL HOLIDAY

[Captioner] 20:16:18
, AS COMMENTED
EARLIER, TO HAVE IT RECOGNIZED AS A

[Captioner] 20:16:21
 CITY
HOLIDAY WHERE IT COULD BE PART OF -- AS

[Captioner] 20:16:25

THE BILL

[Captioner] 20:16:28
 AB2596, THAT IT ALSO DIDN'T

[Captioner] 20:16:32

INCUR ADDITIONAL HOLIDAY OR

[Captioner] 20:16:35
 ADDITIONAL
COSTS TO THE STATE EMPLOYEES.


[Captioner] 20:16:39
>> City Mgr. Shackelford: SO AN UNPAID
DAY OFF.


[Captioner] 20:16:42
>> Vice Mayor Keng: RIGHT.
>> City Mgr. Shackelford: WHICH WOULD

[Captioner] 20:16:44

STILL REQUIRE MEET AND CONFER WITH THE


[Captioner] 20:16:47
LABOR GROUPS AND ALL OF THAT.
OKAY.
>> Mayor Mei: WELL,

[Captioner] 20:16:51
 I THINK PERHAPS
ANOTHER COMPROMISE THAT WOULD SAVE US
MONEY

[Captioner] 20:16:54
 AND TIME IS JUST -- I NOW
COUNCILMEMBER SHAO WAS JUST ASKING TO

[Captioner] 20:16:57
 DO
A QUICK STUDY IN TERM OF WHAT CITY

[Captioner] 20:17:00
IES
AROUND US IN TERMS OF UNDERSTANDING WHAT


[Captioner] 20:17:03
HAS BEEN ADOPTED AND THAT WOULD BE
SIMPLER THAN HAVING TO LOOK AT THE

[Captioner] 20:17:06

COST.
I THINK WE'VE ALREADY DETERMINED THAT


[Captioner] 20:17:09
EVERY TIME WE NEGOTIATE T DOES TAKE
QUITE A BIT

[Captioner] 20:17:12
 OF STAFF TIME AND COST ON
BOTH SIDES.
>> City Mgr. Shackelford: IN ADDITION


[Captioner] 20:17:16
TO WHEN NEW THINGS LIKE THIS ARE ADDED,

[Captioner] 20:17:19

IT DOES TAKE ADDITIONAL STAFF TIME AWAY


[Captioner] 20:17:22
FROM THEIR CORE SERVICE WORK TO DO THESE
KIND OF THINGS, SO I

[Captioner] 20:17:25
 WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU
ALL TO DECIDE IF THIS IS INDEED

[Captioner] 20:17:28

SOMETHING THAT YOU WANT TO DO.


[Captioner] 20:17:32
OTHERWISE, YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW

[Captioner] 20:17:35
 THAT
STAFF NEED TO DO ANY ADDITIONAL
RESEARCH.


[Captioner] 20:17:38
>> Mayor Mei: I'D LIKE TO SUGGEST AN
OPTION

[Captioner] 20:17:41
 WHICH IS ONE WE VOTED ON A FEW
WEEKS AGO, WHICH IS TO LOOK

[Captioner] 20:17:45
 AT
ADDITIONAL DATE.
WHAT YOU'RE ASKING FOR SPECIFICALLY

[Captioner] 20:17:48
 IS
THE RECOGNITION, NOT JUST THE PAID

[Captioner] 20:17:51

HOLIDAY BECAUSE YOU ALREADY HAVE A
FLOATING HOLIDAY THAT ANYONE CAN

[Captioner] 20:17:53
 USE.
YOU'RE ASKING SOMETHING TO RECOGNIZE IT


[Captioner] 20:17:56
WHICH WOULD BE BACK TO OUR DISCUSSION
INITIALLY

[Captioner] 20:17:59
 BE, ADDING THREE MORE DAYS TO
THE EXISTING ONES, I

[Captioner] 20:18:02
 THINK.
SO I THINK THAT SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN
THAT.


[Captioner] 20:18:05
SO WOULD THAT BE AMIABLE TO

[Captioner] 20:18:08
 
YOUR --
>> Vice Mayor Keng: THAT'S FINE.


[Captioner] 20:18:13
>> Councilmember Salwan: THANK YOU,
MADAME MAYOR.
I WAS JUST GOING TO SAY THAT IT

[Captioner] 20:18:16
 SOUNDS
LIKE WE HAVE THE FLOATING HOLIDAY IN
PLACE,

[Captioner] 20:18:20
 SO PERHAPS THE RECOGNITION COULD
BE

[Captioner] 20:18:23
 THE FLAG RAISING.
MAYBE THAT'S WHERE WE RECOGNIZE THE
COMMUNITY

[Captioner] 20:18:26
 AND, YOU KNOW, LET THEM KNOW
THAT WE

[Captioner] 20:18:30
 HAVE THIS EVENT.
SO THAT WE DON'T -- I DEFINITELY

[Captioner] 20:18:33
 WANT
MORE RESEARCH.
I THINK THAT'S

[Captioner] 20:18:36
 JUST -- I DEFINITELY
DON'T WANT MORE RESEARCH, IN THE END IT


[Captioner] 20:18:40
DOESN'T CHANGE THE DECISION-MAKING.


[Captioner] 20:18:42
>> City Mgr. Shackelford: KEEP IN MIND
YOU ALL JUST MADE SOME DECISIONS ABOUT


[Captioner] 20:18:45
FLAG RAISING, HOW MANY AND ALL OF THAT,
SO SOMETHING

[Captioner] 20:18:49
 FOR YOU TO CONSIDER OR
MAYBE YOU CAN REACH CONSENSUS

[Captioner] 20:18:52
 ON THAT
WHEN WE DISCUSS THE FLAG RAISINGS.


[Captioner] 20:18:55
>> Mayor Mei: WONDERFUL.
>> Councilmember Salwan: -- PART

[Captioner] 20:18:58
 OF
THAT.
>> Mayor Mei: THAT'S WHAT I WAS


[Captioner] 20:19:00
THINKING.
WE HAVE A BUNCH OF OTHER COUNCILMEMBERS,


[Captioner] 20:19:03
BUT THE REASON WHY I MOVED THIS AGENDA

[Captioner] 20:19:06

ORIGINALLY FROM THE REFERRALS WAS SO WE


[Captioner] 20:19:09
COULD EAR THE PEOPLE.
SO IF WE ARE IN AGREEMENT AND

[Captioner] 20:19:12
 CONSENSUS
THAT WE HAVE A FLOATING HOLIDAY, THAT
WE'RE GOING TO BE

[Captioner] 20:19:15
 ADDRESSING, WE'VE
ALREADY

[Captioner] 20:19:20
 APPROVED FLAG RAISINGS
TO ADDRESS THIS AND WE

[Captioner] 20:19:23
 WOULD ROTATE
THROUGH THOSE AND THAT'S COMING BACK --


[Captioner] 20:19:26
DO WE HAVE A TIME FRAME, I THINK YOU AND
I TALKED

[Captioner] 20:19:30
 ABOUT THIS, BUT --
>> City Mgr. Shackelford: NO, I DON'T
HAVE

[Captioner] 20:19:33
 A TIME FRAME AT THIS POINT, BUT WE
WILL BE COMING BACK

[Captioner] 20:19:36
 WITH SOMETHING.
>> Mayor Mei: IN THIS NEXT FEW MONTHS,


[Captioner] 20:19:40
AT LEAST, FOR SURE, BECAUSE OTHER DATES
WILL PASS AS WE'VE

[Captioner] 20:19:43
 TALKED ABOUT.
>> IT'S COMING BACK.


[Captioner] 20:19:47
.
>> Mayor Mei:

[Captioner] 20:19:51
 YES, WE'VE ALREADY
PINNED THE STAFF TO THE DATE.
WE'RE GOING

[Captioner] 20:19:54
 TO RECOGNIZE EACH OF THE
CULTURAL GROUPS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE
THROUGH SOME

[Captioner] 20:19:57
 OF THESE DIFFERENT FLAG
RAISINGS

[Captioner] 20:20:01
 AND WE'VE TALKED ABOUT LOOKING
AT THOSE AS A PRIORITY FROM

[Captioner] 20:20:02
 THE
COUNCIL.
SO THANK YOU SO MUCH.


[Captioner] 20:20:06
>> Vice Mayor Keng: SO CAN WE --
>> Mayor Mei: I DON'T THINK

[Captioner] 20:20:07
 YOU
NEED --
>> Councilmember Cox: THERE'S NO


[Captioner] 20:20:12
ACTION.
IT ALREADY EXISTS.
>> Mayor Mei: I WOULD JUST LIKE

[Captioner] 20:20:13
 TO
CLARIFY FROM THE STAFF, IS THAT THE
CASE?


[Captioner] 20:20:16
>> Councilmember Cox: IT ALREADY
EXISTS.


[Captioner] 20:20:19
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: THIS IS VICE
MAYOR KENG'S MOTION.
THERE HASN'T BEEN

[Captioner] 20:20:23
 A SECOND THUS FAR AND
IF THERE IS NO SECOND, IT DICE

[Captioner] 20:20:26
 DIES AND
COUNCIL TAKES NO ACTION.


[Captioner] 20:20:30
>> Mayor Mei: DID SOMEBODY SECOND?


[Captioner] 20:20:35
>> Councilmember Kassan: I SECONDED
THE MOTION WHEN I THOUGHT THE MOTION WAS


[Captioner] 20:20:38
JUST TO HONOR THE EXISTING -- TO -- YOU
KNOW, TO CONTINUE

[Captioner] 20:20:42
 ON AS WE ARE WITH THE
EXISTING FLOATING

[Captioner] 20:20:45
 HOLIDAY, THAT WAS THE
MOTION THAT I SECONDED.
>> Mayor Mei: BUT THAT

[Captioner] 20:20:48
 DOESN'T REQUIRE
A MOTION

[Captioner] 20:20:51
.
>> Councilmember Kassan: CORRECT.
I DEFINITELY AGREE WE SHOULD MOVE ON

[Captioner] 20:20:54
 AND
NOT TAKE ACTION BECAUSE I AGREE WITH
WHAT EVERYONE IS SAYING.


[Captioner] 20:21:00
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY, SO THANK YOU.
WE

[Captioner] 20:21:02
 DEFINITELY --
>> Vice Mayor Keng: SO CAN WE MAKE A

[Captioner] 20:21:06

MOTION TO RECOGNIZE LUNAR NEW YEAR

[Captioner] 20:21:09
 AND
DIWALI, I THINK AS WE DISCUSSED

[Captioner] 20:21:12
 EARLIER,
YOU KNOW

[Captioner] 20:21:16
, THE FLAG RAISING PROGRAM IS
COMING BACK, BUT MAYBE TO

[Captioner] 20:21:20
 BE CONSIDERED
AS ONE OF THE MAJOR FLAG RAISING THAT WE


[Captioner] 20:21:23
WILL BE DISCUSSING.


[Captioner] 20:21:26
>> City Mgr. Shackelford: THAT WILL
TOTALLY BE AT THE DISCRETION OF THE
COUNCIL WHEN YOU

[Captioner] 20:21:29
 HAVE THAT DISCUSSION.


[Captioner] 20:21:33
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: FOR PURPOSES
OF

[Captioner] 20:21:36
 THIS EVENING I THINK IT WOULD EXCEED
WHAT WAS AGENDIZED AND

[Captioner] 20:21:39
 IF THERE'S DESIRE
BY THE COUNCIL TO DO THAT IT SHOULD
HAPPEN AT

[Captioner] 20:21:42
 A FUTURE MEETING.
>> Vice Mayor Keng: SOUNDS GOOD.
BUT I APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSION.


[Captioner] 20:21:47
I THINK WE HAD A VARIETY OF

[Captioner] 20:21:50
 COMMENTS
LOOKING AT -- FROM DIFFERENT ANGLES,
ALSO FISCAL

[Captioner] 20:21:53
 IMPACT, SO I APPRECIATE THE
DISCUSSION THAT WE HAD TONIGHT.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:21:58
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
NEXT ON OUR AGENDA

[Captioner] 20:22:01
 IS ITEM 7.2, WHICH
WE'VE TALKED

[Captioner] 20:22:04
 ABOUT, WE'RE FLEX TO MOVING
THE REFERRALS FORWARD.
THIS

[Captioner] 20:22:08
 IS REGARDING RENTAL PROTECTIONS AND
THIS IS

[Captioner] 20:22:11
 BEING MADE BY COUNCILMEMBER
KASSAN.
>> Councilmember Kassan: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:22:14
AND I'M VERY IMPRESSED WITH THE EFFORTS
OF

[Captioner] 20:22:17
 THE EAST BAY RENTAL HOUSING
ASSOCIATION AND THE

[Captioner] 20:22:20
 CALIFORNIA APARTMENT
ASSOCIATION WITH ITS EFFORTS TO ORGANIZE


[Captioner] 20:22:23
A VERY BIG EMAIL CAMPAIGN OPPOSING THIS
REFERRAL,

[Captioner] 20:22:28
 BUT THE FORM EMAIL THAT WAS
SENT OUT

[Captioner] 20:22:32
 DID SEEM TO MISUNDERSTAND THIS
REFERRAL, SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE

[Captioner] 20:22:33
 IT
CLEAR THAT WHAT THIS REFERRAL IS ABOUT


[Captioner] 20:22:37
IS THE RECOGNITION THAT WE'VE HAD EE

[Captioner] 20:22:40
 VIK
MORATORIUM IN PLACE FOR QUITE A WHILE
AND THAT IS COMING TO

[Captioner] 20:22:44
 AN END IN LESS
THAN TWO MONTHS, AND IN OTHER

[Captioner] 20:22:47
 CITIES
WHERE IT'S COME TO AN END, THERE HAS
BEEN A REALLY BIG

[Captioner] 20:22:50
 UPTICK IN EVICTIONS
AND LEADING TO MORE

[Captioner] 20:22:54
 HOMELESSNESS.
AND AS I WAS THINKING ABOUT THIS AND
WONDERING

[Captioner] 20:22:57
 WHAT WE SHOULD DO THIS ABOUT

[Captioner] 20:22:59

THIS, IF ANYTHING, I REMEMBERED BACK IN


[Captioner] 20:23:02
2019 THAT STAFF HAD COME TO US WITH SOME
PROPOSED CHANGES

[Captioner] 20:23:06
 TO OUR RENT REVIEW
ORDINANCE, AND WE

[Captioner] 20:23:09
 ADOPTED SOME OF THEM
BUT NOT OTHERS SO I THOUGHT, YOU KNOW,

[Captioner] 20:23:12

THIS IS A REALLY GREAT OPPORTUNITY, IT


[Captioner] 20:23:15
WAS IN 2019 SO IT'S BEEN QUITE A WHILE
NOW, FOUR YEARS SINCE WE'VE

[Captioner] 20:23:18
 LOOKED AT
OUR RENT REVIEW ORDINANCE, AND A LOT OF


[Captioner] 20:23:21
THOSE HAVE CHANGED AND I THOUGHT IT
WOULD BE A REALLY

[Captioner] 20:23:25
 -- THE RENT REVIEW
ORDINANCE AND HOW IT'S WORKING IN

[Captioner] 20:23:28

PRACTICE.
SOME SAY IT'S WORKING WELL, THAT


[Captioner] 20:23:31
THAT'S -- YOU WOULDN'T HEAR THAT FROM
MANY RENTERS.
MANY

[Captioner] 20:23:35
 RENTERS DON'T FEEL THAT IT'S
WORKING WELL.
SO THIS BE

[Captioner] 20:23:39
 REFERRAL, EVEN THOUGH IT
MENTIONS SOME EXAMPLES

[Captioner] 20:23:42
 EXAMPLES STAFF
COULD LOOK

[Captioner] 20:23:45
 AT, I'M ABSOLUTELY NOT MAKING
ANY SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS.


[Captioner] 20:23:49
I'M JUST ASKING FOR A REFERRAL FOR STAFF
TO TAKE SOME TIME TO

[Captioner] 20:23:53
 LOOK AT THE RENT
REVIEW ORDINANCE, HOW IT'S WORKING,

[Captioner] 20:23:56
 WHAT
ARE THE CURRENT ISSUES THAT ARE
HAPPENING IN FREMONT, WHAT ARE THE


[Captioner] 20:23:59
CURRENT THREATS THAT COULD ARISE AS A
RESULT OF THE END OF

[Captioner] 20:24:02
 THE EVICTION
MORATORIUM AND COULD

[Captioner] 20:24:05
 BACK WITH SOME
RECOMMENDATIONS ON THINGS WE CAN DO TO


[Captioner] 20:24:08
IMPROVE THE RENT REVIEW ORDINANCE.
SO THAT'S ALL THE REFERRAL

[Captioner] 20:24:11
 IS.
AND I HOPE WE CAN

[Captioner] 20:24:14
 ADOPT THAT.
THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:24:18
I THINK STAFF WAS GOING TO PROVIDE SOME

[Captioner] 20:24:21

COMMENTS ON THE

[Captioner] 20:24:25
 RENT REVIEW ORDINANCE
BEFORE WE PROCEED TO PUBLIC

[Captioner] 20:24:28
 COMMENTS, OR
AM I INCORRECT IN THAT?


[Captioner] 20:24:34
>> City Mgr. Shackelford: SUZANNE,
WOULD YOU LIKE TO OFFER ANYTHING ABOUT

[Captioner] 20:24:37

WHAT'S CURRENTLY BEING DONE OR HOW STAFF


[Captioner] 20:24:40
IS PREPARING TO DEAL WITH ANY POTENTIAL

[Captioner] 20:24:44

FALLOUT FROM THE LIFTING OF THE

[Captioner] 20:24:47
 EVICTION
MORATORIUM?


[Captioner] 20:25:12
>> GOOD EVENING, COUNCILMEMBERS.
I DON'T REALLY HAVE

[Captioner] 20:25:15
 A PREPARED
PRESENTATION.
I JUST WANT TO REMIND THE

[Captioner] 20:25:18
 COUNCIL A
LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE

[Captioner] 20:25:22
 RENT REVIEW
ORDINANCE.
WHICH

[Captioner] 20:25:25
 WAS ADOPTED BY THE CITY COUNCIL
BACK

[Captioner] 20:25:29
 IN OCTOBER

[Captioner] 20:25:32
 OF 2017.


[Captioner] 20:25:36
AND I HAVE WITH ME ROBERT LOPEZ, WHO

[Captioner] 20:25:39

OVERSEES THE RENT REVIEW BOARD, AND THE

[Captioner] 20:25:43

RENT REVIEW PROCESS.
ALSO I DO WANT

[Captioner] 20:25:46
 TO SHARE THAT, YOU KNOW,

[Captioner] 20:25:49

WE HAVE PUSHED OUT A LOT OF RENTAL
ASSISTANCE

[Captioner] 20:25:53
 IN OUR KEEP FREMONT HOUSED
PROGRAM.


[Captioner] 20:25:56
WE'VE ASSISTED A LOT OF TENANTS

[Captioner] 20:25:59
 WITH
MONEY THAT WENT PRIMARILY TO LANDLORDS


[Captioner] 20:26:02
TO PAY RENT IN ARREARS, AND WE HAVE SOME

[Captioner] 20:26:05

OF OUR E-RAP DOLLARS REMAINING AND

[Captioner] 20:26:09
 OUR
INTENT IS TO BE

[Captioner] 20:26:12
 ABLE TO OFFER ONGOING
TRAINING

[Captioner] 20:26:16
, ASSISTANCE, GET INFORMATION UP
ON OUR

[Captioner] 20:26:19
 WEBSITE, ET CETERA, WORK WITH
SOME OF THE LEGAL ORGANIZATIONS

[Captioner] 20:26:23
 SO THAT
PEOPLE WILL BE INFORMED IF

[Captioner] 20:26:26
 THEY ARE
PRESENTED WITH

[Captioner] 20:26:31
 EVICTION NOTICES OF WHAT
THE PROCESS IS AND WHAT THE TIMING IS

[Captioner] 20:26:33
 IN
RELATION TO COURT HEARINGS, ET CETERA.


[Captioner] 20:26:38
SO WE ARE GEARING UP FOR THAT, AND WE

[Captioner] 20:26:40

HOPE TO HAVE OUR STAFF TRAINED UP TO BE


[Captioner] 20:26:43
ABLE TO RESPOND TO QUESTIONS AND ALSO
HAVE A

[Captioner] 20:26:47
 LOT OF INFORMATION.


[Captioner] 20:26:50
SOME VIDEOS THAT WE'RE REVIEWING

[Captioner] 20:26:53
 RIGHT
NOW ON WHAT THE PROCESS AND PROCEDURES

[Captioner] 20:26:56

WILL BE.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK

[Captioner] 20:27:00
 YOU.
DO WE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE

[Captioner] 20:27:02

COUNCIL?
OTHERWISE WE HAVE PUBLIC SPEAKERS.


[Captioner] 20:27:05
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN, QUESTION?
>> Councilmember Salwan: THANK

[Captioner] 20:27:08
 YOU,
MADAME MAYOR.
MS. SHENFIL, WE HAD DIRECT

[Captioner] 20:27:11
 FUNDING FROM
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, I FORGOT THE
EXACT AMOUNT BUT IT WAS

[Captioner] 20:27:14
 SEVERAL
MILLION.
>> Mayor Mei: 17 MILLION.


[Captioner] 20:27:17
>> Councilmember Salwan: 17 MILLION.
WOW.
COULD YOU

[Captioner] 20:27:20
 KIND OF PROVIDE SOME KIND OF
REPORT ON

[Captioner] 20:27:23
 HOW THAT MONEY WAS USED, WHERE
IT WENT AND

[Captioner] 20:27:26
 SO FORTH?
BECAUSE THAT WAS CONSIDERABLE SUMS THAT


[Captioner] 20:27:30
WE RECEIVED.
>> IT WAS.
SO WE HAVE PRODUCED AND WE HAVE

[Captioner] 20:27:34
 UP ON
OUR WEBSITE AB KIND OF

[Captioner] 20:27:37
 INTERVIEW REPORT
ON THE

[Captioner] 20:27:40
 KEEP FREMONT HOUSED PROGRAM.
I THINK

[Captioner] 20:27:43
 COUNCIL RECEIVED A COPY OF THE
REPORT, BUT JUST IN

[Captioner] 20:27:47
 A SENATE SHOT, WE

[Captioner] 20:27:49

PROVIDED TOTAL ASSISTANCE TO LANDLORDS


[Captioner] 20:27:55
OVER $16,500,000, AND THAT WAS FOR RENT

[Captioner] 20:27:59

IN ARREARS FOR 1531 UNITS.


[Captioner] 20:28:05
AND I KNOW I DON'T HAVE -- I DID NOT
FLAG

[Captioner] 20:28:08
 THE NUMBER OF ACTUAL TENANTS WHO
WERE ASSISTED.


[Captioner] 20:28:11
ROBERT, DO YOU HAVE A --

[Captioner] 20:28:15
 DO YOU KNOW?
>> Mayor Mei: I THINK IT WAS ALSO
UTILITY ASSISTANCE

[Captioner] 20:28:18
 TOO, SO THAT'S WHY WE
HAVE THE TOTAL

[Captioner] 20:28:22
 OF 17.2 MILLION BETWEEN
THE TWO.
>> THAT WAS

[Captioner] 20:28:25
 APPLICATIONS WE RECEIVED,

[Captioner] 20:28:28

1540 APPLICATIONS WERE APPROVED FOR
RENTAL

[Captioner] 20:28:32
 ASSISTANCE, AND THEN WE

[Captioner] 20:28:35
 ALSO
TOTALING OVER ALMOST

[Captioner] 20:28:41
 $14 MILLION, WE
PROVIDED SOME PROSPECTIVE RENT FOR
PEOPLE WHO

[Captioner] 20:28:44
 WERE VERY, VERY LOW INCOME,

[Captioner] 20:28:47

OVER $3 MILLION.
OVER HALF A MILLION DOLLARS IN

[Captioner] 20:28:51
 UTILITY
ASSISTANCE FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE

[Captioner] 20:28:54
 IN
ARREARS.
THE

[Captioner] 20:28:58
 REPORT SHOWED A BALANCE OF HOW DID
THE

[Captioner] 20:29:02
 TENANTS BENEFIT, IN TERMS OF WHERE
THEY WERE ECONOMICALLY.


[Captioner] 20:29:05
OUR PRIORITY AT FIRST WAS GIVEN TO VERY
LOW INCOME FAMILIES

[Captioner] 20:29:08
 AT 30% OF MEDIAN AND
50%

[Captioner] 20:29:13
 OF MEDIAN INCOME.
THEY HAD TO

[Captioner] 20:29:17
 HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY COVID,
WHICH IS WHY THEY

[Captioner] 20:29:20
 WERE IN SOME AMOUNT OF

[Captioner] 20:29:22

DOCUMENTATION SO THAT WE COULD SATISFY


[Captioner] 20:29:26
THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT WHO GAVE US THE FUNDING.


[Captioner] 20:29:35
 BUT THE MONEY ACTUALLY WENT TO 
THE LANDLORDS

[Captioner] 20:29:39
.
>> Councilmember Salwan:   FOR 
THE TENANTS, THE RENT

[Captioner] 20:29:42
 THAT THE 
TENANTS DID NOT PAY.

[Captioner] 20:29:45

>> Mayor Mei:   AND THE 
UTILITIES.


[Captioner] 20:29:48
I WAS GOING TO CLARIFY THAT TOO.


[Captioner] 20:29:52
>> Councilmember Salwan:   ONCE 
THIS EXPIRES WHAT KIND OF 
RESOURCES

[Captioner] 20:29:55
 ARE WE PROVIDING 
TENANTS?

[Captioner] 20:29:58

>> Suzanne Shenfil:   PRIMARILY 
INFORMATION BUT WE'LL

[Captioner] 20:30:01
 BE 
PROVIDING CASE

[Captioner] 20:30:05
 MANAGEMENT 
SERVICES FOR TENANTS THAT WILL 
BE IN PARTICULAR

[Captioner] 20:30:08
 DIFFICULTY.
WE'LL BE PROVIDING INFORMATION 
TO

[Captioner] 20:30:11
 HELP PEOPLE RELOCATE IF 
THEY'RE GOING TO NEED TO DO 
THAT.

[Captioner] 20:30:14

YOU KNOW IF THERE'S STILL 
LOOKING LIKE

[Captioner] 20:30:17
 THEY'RE NOT GOING 
TO BE ABLE TO PAY RENT GOING 
FORWARD,

[Captioner] 20:30:21
 PEOPLE MAY BE TRYING TO 
DOWNSIZE.
I MEAN

[Captioner] 20:30:24
 IT'S MUCH BETTER TO 
DOWNSIZE OR EVEN IF

[Captioner] 20:30:28
 -- 
UNFORTUNATELY IF YOU HAVE TO 
LEAVE THE AREA THAN IT IS

[Captioner] 20:30:31
 TO GET 
AN EVICTION ON YOUR RECORD AS

[Captioner] 20:30:34
 A 
TENANT.
SO YOU KNOW WE'RE

[Captioner] 20:30:37
 REALLY 
ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO THINK

[Captioner] 20:30:41
 
ABOUT THEIR

[Captioner] 20:30:44
 NEXT STEPS.
>> Councilmember Salwan:   AND I 
KNOW IN 2019 WE HAD

[Captioner] 20:30:47
 THE RENT 
MEDIATION PROGRAM.

[Captioner] 20:30:51

SO DID IT GO UNDER, WHEN THE 
COVID

[Captioner] 20:30:54
 MORATORIUM STARTED?
DID THEY MEET AFTER THAT?
OR WHEN WAS

[Captioner] 20:30:57
 THE LAST TIME THEY 
MET, DO YOU KNOW

[Captioner] 20:31:01
?
>> GOOD EVENING, COUNCILMEMBER.
THE RENT REVIEW

[Captioner] 20:31:04
 BOARD HAS 
ACTUALLY NEVER MET DURING ITS

[Captioner] 20:31:07
 
EXISTENCE.
A LOT OF OUR CASES ACTUALLY

[Captioner] 20:31:12
 GET  
SOLVED IN MEDIATION

[Captioner] 20:31:16
 OR 
CONSULTATION.
WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO CONSULT OR 


[Captioner] 20:31:19
MEDIATE A LOT OF THE CASE BEFORE 
THEY GET TO THAT STAGE.
OR

[Captioner] 20:31:22
 A LOT OF TIMES THE TENANT AND 
THE

[Captioner] 20:31:25
 LANDLORD WILL SOLVE IT OUT 
OF THE PROCESS AS WELL WITHOUT 
OUR HELP.

[Captioner] 20:31:27

>> Councilmember Salwan:   SO 
WHAT IS THE SUCCESS RATE ON A 


[Captioner] 20:31:30
LOT OF THOSE?
>> I DON'T HAVE THAT EXACT 
NUMBER.

[Captioner] 20:31:34

BUT I WOULD SAY PROBABLY CLOSER 
TO ABOUT 40

[Captioner] 20:31:37
%.
JUST BECAUSE A LOT OF THEM ARE

[Captioner] 20:31:40
 
SOLVED OUTSIDE OF THE PROCESS.
THOSE KIND OF FALL OUT AND

[Captioner] 20:31:42
 KIND 
OF WATER DOWN THE NUMBER.
>> Councilmember Salwan:   OKAY, 


[Captioner] 20:31:46
THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei:   THIS IS 
CLARIFYING QUESTIONS.

[Captioner] 20:31:50

NEXT COUNCILMEMBER SHAO AND 
FOLLOWED BY

[Captioner] 20:31:53
 COUNCILMEMBER 
CAMPBELL AND

[Captioner] 20:31:57
 COUNCILMEMBER COX.
>> Councilmember Shao:   THANK 
YOU MAYOR

[Captioner] 20:32:01
.
READING THE REFERRAL, STAFF 
IDENTIFIED A

[Captioner] 20:32:04
 THIRD AMENDMENT 
RECENTLY, I'M WONDERING

[Captioner] 20:32:07
 WHO 
IDENTIFIED WHAT?
>> Councilmember Kassan:  

[Captioner] 20:32:10
 I'LL 
JUST ANSWER THAT IT WAS IN THE 
STAFF

[Captioner] 20:32:14
 BRIEFING AND WE WERE 
TALKING ABOUT SOME OF THIS AND 
SOME OF THE STAFF

[Captioner] 20:32:17
 MENTIONED THIS 
IS SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN COMING 
UP LATELY

[Captioner] 20:32:20
.
THAT'S WHAT THAT CAME FROM FROM 
A

[Captioner] 20:32:23
 STAFF BRIEFING I WAS IN.
>> Councilmember Shao:   MY 
SECOND QUESTION IS

[Captioner] 20:32:26
, THIS HERE, 
SPECIFICALLY MENTIONED SOMETHING

[Captioner] 20:32:30
 
LIKE, A LIMITATION ON THE 
LANDLORD TO

[Captioner] 20:32:33
 CONDUCT CRIMINAL 
BACKGROUND CHECK.


[Captioner] 20:32:37
SO MY QUESTION IS:  FIRST OF 
ALL,

[Captioner] 20:32:40
 IS STAFF AWAY OF

[Captioner] 20:32:44
 ANY 
VIOLATION OF CALIFORNIA

[Captioner] 20:32:47
 
CONSTITUTION?
U.S. CONSTITUTION?

[Captioner] 20:32:50

IN TERMS OF TREATMENT,

[Captioner] 20:32:53
 PEOPLE 
WITH CRIMINAL BACKGROUND, WITH 
REGARD TO

[Captioner] 20:32:57
 OUR CURRENT

[Captioner] 20:33:01
 RO, IF 
THERE ARE ANY VIOLATION, IF SO

[Captioner] 20:33:04
, 
THEN IT'S A LEGAL ISSUE THEN WE 
HAVE TO FIX IT.

[Captioner] 20:33:07

OTHERWISE I JUST WANT TO SEE

[Captioner] 20:33:10
 
WHETHER OUR CURRENT RO IS STILL 
LEGAL.


[Captioner] 20:33:14
IN FRONT OF U.S. CONSTITUTION, 
AND THE CALIFORNIA

[Captioner] 20:33:18
 CONSTITUTION.


[Captioner] 20:33:24
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado:   OUR 
LOCAL YOU LAW IS STILL LEGAL

[Captioner] 20:33:25
, 
YES.
>> Councilmember Shao:   THANK 


[Captioner] 20:33:28
YOU.
MY THIRD QUESTION IS SO FAR IN 
THE PAST, HAVE

[Captioner] 20:33:31
 THE RENT REVIEW 
BOARD RECEIVED ANY

[Captioner] 20:33:35
 COMPLAINTS, 
FROM TENANTS

[Captioner] 20:33:38
 OR POTENTIAL 
TENANTS, REGARDING

[Captioner] 20:33:41
 
DISCRIMINATION, SOLELY BASED ON

[Captioner] 20:33:44
 
THEIR PAST CRIMINAL RECORDS?


[Captioner] 20:33:51
>> Suzanne Shenfil:   WE HAVEN'T 
BEEN TRACKING THAT ACTUALLY

[Captioner] 20:33:55
.
WE'RE LOOKING MORE AT ISSUES OF 
RACIAL

[Captioner] 20:33:58
 DISCRIMINATION AND OTHER 
TYPES OF THINGS.


[Captioner] 20:34:01
SOURCES OF INCOME, THAT SORT OF 
THING.


[Captioner] 20:34:05
SO NOT TO MY KNOWLEDGE, THAT -- 
I DON'T BELIEVE

[Captioner] 20:34:08
 THAT'S BEEN 
BROUGHT UP.
>> Councilmember Shao:   SO 


[Captioner] 20:34:11
WOULD YOU AGREE THAT IN OTHER 
WORDS,

[Captioner] 20:34:15
 WITH REGARDING TO 
DISCRIMINATION AGAINST

[Captioner] 20:34:18
 
CRIMINALS, THE CURRENT RO IS 
STILL A SOUND

[Captioner] 20:34:21
 SYSTEM?
>> Suzanne Shenfil:   OUR 
CURRENT

[Captioner] 20:34:24
 RENT REVIEW DOESN'T 
REALLY DEAL WITH THAT AS AN 
ISSUE

[Captioner] 20:34:27
.
BUT I DO HAVE TO MENTION THAT 
THE

[Captioner] 20:34:30
 LEGISLATURE'S PASSED SB 731 
WHICH IS

[Captioner] 20:34:33
 GOING TO GO INTO EFFECT 
IN JULY WHICH IS GOING TO BE 
LOOKING

[Captioner] 20:34:37
 AT PEOPLE WHO HAVE 
SERVED THEIR

[Captioner] 20:34:40
 TERMS IN THE 
CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM.
AND WHO HAVE

[Captioner] 20:34:43
, FOR FOUR YEARS, 
NOT HAVE ANY

[Captioner] 20:34:47
 ADDITIONAL 
INVOLVEMENT WITH THE -- WITH LAW 
ENFORCEMENT, AND

[Captioner] 20:34:50
 HAVE PROVEN 
THAT THEY'VE BEEN GOOD CITIZENS.
THEN

[Captioner] 20:34:54
 THEY HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY 
TO HAVE THEIR RECORDS IN

[Captioner] 20:34:59
 SOME 
SITUATIONS EITHER SEALED

[Captioner] 20:35:02
 OR 
EXPUNGED.
SO THAT WILL BE FOR CERTAIN

[Captioner] 20:35:05
 
KINDS OF CRIMINAL ACTIVITY.


[Captioner] 20:35:08
NONVIOLENT KINDS OF CRIMES AND 
OTHER KINDS OF CRIMES.
BUT THAT'S

[Captioner] 20:35:11
 A PIECE OF 
LEGISLATION THAT WILL GO INTO 
EFFECT IN

[Captioner] 20:35:15
 JULY.
>> Councilmember Shao:   SO 
FOLLOWING THAT,

[Captioner] 20:35:18
 IS IT TRUE THAT 
EVEN IF THE LANDLORD WANTS TO

[Captioner] 20:35:21
 
DIG UP THAT PART OF THE CRIMINAL 
RECORDS OF THAT

[Captioner] 20:35:24
 POTENTIAL 
TENANT, THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO?

[Captioner] 20:35:27

BECAUSE THAT PART OF THE RECORD 
HAS BEEN EXPUNGED

[Captioner] 20:35:32
?
>> Suzanne Shenfil:   I THINK 
THERE'S A

[Captioner] 20:35:36
 LITTLE -- IDEALLY, 
YES, I WOULD SAY

[Captioner] 20:35:38
 IDEALLY YES.
>> Councilmember Shao:   THANK 
YOU.


[Captioner] 20:35:42
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU FOR 
YOUR CLARIFYING QUESTIONS.
AGAIN

[Captioner] 20:35:45
, CLARIFYING QUESTIONS, 
COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL.

[Captioner] 20:35:48

>> Councilmember Campbell:   
THANK YOU, THANK YOU FOR 


[Captioner] 20:35:51
BRINGING THIS,

[Captioner] 20:35:57
 COUNCILMEMBER 
KENG, I HAVE A LOT,

[Captioner] 20:36:00
 WE'LL BE 
HERE UNTIL TOMORROW IF I ASK ALL 
MY QUESTIONS.

[Captioner] 20:36:03

DO WE GET A SENSE OF HOW MANY 
PEOPLE MAY NEED

[Captioner] 20:36:07
 ASSISTANCE, ONCE 
THE MORATORIUM

[Captioner] 20:36:10
 IS LIFTED?

[Captioner] 20:36:15

IN OTHER WORDS DO WE HAVE A LIST 
OF PEOPLE THAT ARE

[Captioner] 20:36:18
 STILL IN THE 
QUEUE TO HELP WITH

[Captioner] 20:36:21
 THEIR PAST 
DUE RENT?
>> NO

[Captioner] 20:36:24
.
>> Councilmember Campbell:   AND 
THEN DOES OUR

[Captioner] 20:36:28
 CURRENT RENT 
REVIEW ORDINANCE

[Captioner] 20:36:31
 PROHIBIT 
EVICTIONS UNDER CERTAIN 
CIRCUMSTANCES?


[Captioner] 20:36:36
NO.
OKAY.
>> NO

[Captioner] 20:36:39
.
>> Councilmember Campbell:   AND 
IS THIS REFERRAL ASKING

[Captioner] 20:36:43
 US TO 
PROHIBIT, TO ADD INTO

[Captioner] 20:36:47
 THE 
ORDINANCE, TO PROHIBIT EVICTIONS 
AT ALL

[Captioner] 20:36:52
?
>> NO.
>> Councilmember Campbell:   NO

[Captioner] 20:36:55
, 
OKAY, OKAY.
BECAUSE I WAS JUST -- I WAS

[Captioner] 20:36:58
 JUST 
REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT

[Captioner] 20:37:02
 THE 
ATTACHMENT TO THE -- TO

[Captioner] 20:37:05
 THIS 
ITEM THAT TALKED SPECIFICALLY

[Captioner] 20:37:09
 
ABOUT CERTAIN CONDITIONS THAT

[Captioner] 20:37:13
 
WOULD KEEP FOLKS FROM BEING 
EVICTED

[Captioner] 20:37:15
.
THAT'S WHAT IT SOUNDED LIKE TO 
ME.


[Captioner] 20:37:18
THAT'S WHAT I READ INTO WHAT I 
SAW.
AND I JUST WANTED TO

[Captioner] 20:37:22
 MAKE SURE 
THAT THAT WAS CLEAR.
THAT THE REFERRAL

[Captioner] 20:37:25
 IS NOT ASKING 
THE CITY TO

[Captioner] 20:37:29
 PROHIBIT EVICTIONS 
UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES

[Captioner] 20:37:33
.
>> AND THAT'S A QUESTION

[Captioner] 20:37:36
 FOR 
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN TO REFER TO

[Captioner] 20:37:37

TO.
>> Councilmember Kassan:   THE 


[Captioner] 20:37:41
REFERRAL IS ASKING STAFF TO DO 
RESEARCH IF THERE ARE ANY 
AMENDMENTS

[Captioner] 20:37:44
 THAT SHOULD BE MADE 
TO THE RENT REVIEW ORDINANCE IN 
THEIR

[Captioner] 20:37:47
 BEST JUDGMENT BASED ON 
THEIR RESEARCH OF WHAT'S GOING 
ON IN OTHER CITIES

[Captioner] 20:37:50
 AND WHAT'S 
GOING ON HERE.
WHATEVER THOSE MAY BE.


[Captioner] 20:37:53
NOW I KIND OF REGRET LISTING 
THOSE THREE

[Captioner] 20:37:56
 EXAMPLES BECAUSE 
PEOPLE REALLY NOAND ON THOSE 
THREE

[Captioner] 20:37:59
 EXAMPLES BUT THEY'RE JUST 
EXAMPLES.
I'M

[Captioner] 20:38:02
 NOT ASKING FOR THOSE THREE 
THINGS TO BE APPROVED TODAY

[Captioner] 20:38:06
.
THOSE WERE THREE EXAMPLES OF 
THINGS THAT HAD COME UP THAT

[Captioner] 20:38:09
 
STAFF MIGHT LOOK AT.
SO ALL I'M ASKING IS JUST TO

[Captioner] 20:38:12
 ASK 
STAFF TO LOOK INTO WHAT MIGHT BE 
DONE TO THE ORDINANCE

[Captioner] 20:38:15
 TO AMEND 
IT TO MAKE THINGS MORE FAIR

[Captioner] 20:38:18
, AND 
RESULT IN LESS UNJUST

[Captioner] 20:38:21
 EVICTIONS, 
THAT WERE OBSERVED, YOU KNOW 
THERE

[Captioner] 20:38:25
 WERE OBSERVATIONS OF SOME 
UNJUST

[Captioner] 20:38:28
 THINGS HAPPENING BACK IN 
2019 WHICH LED TO

[Captioner] 20:38:31
 SOME OF THOSE 
RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE FIRST 
PLACE

[Captioner] 20:38:35
.
>> Karena Shackelford:   IN THE 
SPIRIT OF MAKING SURE WE DISCUSS

[Captioner] 20:38:38
 
THIS REFERRAL AS WE DISCUSS 
OTHER COUNCIL

[Captioner] 20:38:42
 REFERRALS, I WOULD 
ENCOURAGE THE COUNCIL

[Captioner] 20:38:45
 TO, YOU 
KNOW, FOCUS ON THE Q&A OF THIS

[Captioner] 20:38:49
 
DISCUSSION WITH THE 
COUNCILMEMBER, WITH

[Captioner] 20:38:50
 
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN WHO PUT IT 
FORWARD.


[Captioner] 20:38:53
STAFF IS HERE AND AVAILABLE TO 
RESPOND TO SOME QUESTIONS

[Captioner] 20:38:57
.
BUT WE ARE NOT HERE OR PREPARED

[Captioner] 20:39:00
 
TO MAKE A FULL FLEDGED REPORT OR 
PRESENTATION

[Captioner] 20:39:05
.
AND I'D ALSO LIKE TO OFFER THAT

[Captioner] 20:39:07
 
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT STAFF IS 
LOOKING AT.


[Captioner] 20:39:10
WE TOO SHARE THE CONCERN ABOUT 
THE LIFTING OF THE EVICTION 
MORATORIUM

[Captioner] 20:39:14
.
AND WE'RE TRACKING WITH THE 
COUNTY

[Captioner] 20:39:17
 AND, YOU KNOW, ARE TRYING 
TO MAKE SURE WE'RE ALIGNED WITH 
THE

[Captioner] 20:39:21
 WORK THAT'S BEING DONE IN 
THE COUNTY WHILE

[Captioner] 20:39:25
 ALSO TRACKING 
THIS NEW LEGISLATION THAT

[Captioner] 20:39:28
 
SUZANNE MENTIONED A MOMENT AGO.
>> Mayor Mei:   RIGHT BECAUSE

[Captioner] 20:39:31
 
THAT IS AT THE STATE LEVEL AND 
ALSO AT THE COUNTY LEVEL FOR 


[Captioner] 20:39:34
SOME OF THESE.
I ALSO WANTED TO CLARIFY

[Captioner] 20:39:38
, I AM 
LOOKING AT THE CLOCK.
IN ALL FAIRNESS WE

[Captioner] 20:39:41
 HAVE 22 
SPEAKERS FOR THIS ITEM.
I'M GO QUICKLY

[Captioner] 20:39:44
 THROUGH THE 
QUESTIONS.
WE'LL HAVE TO TAKE A TEN MINUTE

[Captioner] 20:39:48
 
BREAK IN ALL FAIRNESS FOR THE 
STENO CAPTIONER.

[Captioner] 20:39:51

WE HAVE COUNCILMEMBER KENG AND

[Captioner] 20:39:54
 
COUNCILMEMBER COX.
WE WILL

[Captioner] 20:39:57
 REFER IDEALLY TO THE 
MAKER, BUT THEY ARE

[Captioner] 20:40:00
 NOT MAKING A 
FULL PRESENTATION TODAY.
COUNCILMEMBER COX.


[Captioner] 20:40:05
>> Councilmember Cox:   THANK 
YOU.
I WOULD LIKE TO ASK A QUESTION

[Captioner] 20:40:09
 
TO COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN.
BASICALLY, YOU'RE

[Captioner] 20:40:12
 ASKING TO DO 
THE RESEARCH TO FIND OUT WHAT 
NEEDS TO BE

[Captioner] 20:40:15
 COVERED, AND 
ADDITIONAL RENT

[Captioner] 20:40:19
ERS' PROTECTION.
IS THAT WHAT YOUR PLANNING TO 
ACHIEVE

[Captioner] 20:40:22
?
BECAUSE YOU GAVE TWO EXAMPLES 
THAT WERE NOT ADOPTED

[Captioner] 20:40:25
.
THE RETALIATION AND THE REASON 
FOR RENT INCREASE

[Captioner] 20:40:28
 OVER 5%.
AND I'M TRYING TO

[Captioner] 20:40:33
 UNDERSTAND THE

[Captioner] 20:40:36
 
FULL SCOPE OF WHAT YOU'RE 
ACTUALLY ASKING, LOOKING AT

[Captioner] 20:40:39
 
THESE DIFFERENT AMENDMENTS AND 
THINGS YOU'RE LISTING HERE

[Captioner] 20:40:43
.
>> Councilmember Kassan:   AS 
PROBABLY HEARD A LOT

[Captioner] 20:40:46
 OF CITIES 
AND THE COUNTY ARE DOING A LOT 
OF THINKING ABOUT ADD

[Captioner] 20:40:50
ING 
ADDITIONAL RENTER PROTECTIONS AS 
IT'S GOTTEN HARDER

[Captioner] 20:40:53
 AND HARDER 
FOR PEOPLE STAYING HOUSED, AS WE 
HEARD

[Captioner] 20:40:57
 FROM KATHERINE RUBY 
EARLIER, THERE ARE A LOT OF

[Captioner] 20:41:00
 
PEOPLE FACING EVICTION

[Captioner] 20:41:04
 AND 
HAVING TROUBLE FINDING HOUSING.

[Captioner] 20:41:07

OBVIOUSLY, YOU KNOW, WE DON'T 
WANT TO MAKE IT A MARKETPLACE

[Captioner] 20:41:09
 
WHERE IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO BE A 
LANDLORD BUT THERE ARE CERTAINLY 


[Captioner] 20:41:13
MANY CITIES THAT HAVE BROUGHT 
SOME RENTER PROTECTIONS IN

[Captioner] 20:41:16
 TO 
HELP MAKE IT A LITTLE MORE 
BALANCED AND TO PREVENT MASSIVE

[Captioner] 20:41:20
 
AMOUNTS OF HOMELESSNESS 
HAPPENING.


[Captioner] 20:41:23
I THOUGHT NOW WOULD BE A REALLY 
GOOD TIME TO LOOK AT THIS

[Captioner] 20:41:26
 NOW 
THAT THE EVICTION MORATORIUM IS 
COMING THE AN END

[Captioner] 20:41:29
 AND MANY, MANY 
JURISDICTIONS ARE LOOKING AT 
THINGS THAT THEY CAN DO

[Captioner] 20:41:32
 TO TRY 
MEAT

[Captioner] 20:41:36
 
AMELIORATE PART OF

[Captioner] 20:41:39
 THE ISSUES 
THAT ARE COMING IN NEIGHBORING 
CITIES

[Captioner] 20:41:43
.
I GAVE SOME EXAMPLES THAT HAD 
BEEN

[Captioner] 20:41:46
 RECOMMENDED BY STAFF IN THE 
PAST BUT IT WAS BROUGHT TO OUR 
ATTENTION

[Captioner] 20:41:50
 IN 2019, STAFF CAME TO 
COUNCIL ASKING

[Captioner] 20:41:54
 FOR CHANGES IN 
THE RENT ORDINANCE, BASED

[Captioner] 20:41:58
 ON 
THINGS THEY WERE SEEING IN IT

[Captioner] 20:42:01
, 
BUT SOME OF THE PROBLEMS HAVE 
NOT BEEN RESOLVED

[Captioner] 20:42:04
 AND I THOUGHT 
IT WOULD BE A GOOD TIME FOR 
STAFF TO

[Captioner] 20:42:07
 TAKE ANOTHER GOOD LOOK 
TO SEE IF THERE WERE

[Captioner] 20:42:10
 ADDITIONAL 
RECOMMENDATIONS.
NOW IS AN EXCELLENT TIME DID 


[Captioner] 20:42:14
THIS BECAUSE THERE HAS BEEN SO 
MUCH ACTIVITY

[Captioner] 20:42:18
 ON THIS IN OUR 
COUNTY AND NEIGHBORING CITIES 
AND THE

[Captioner] 20:42:21
 EVICTION MORATORIUM IS 
ABOUT TO END.
>> Councilmember Cox:   THANK 


[Captioner] 20:42:24
YOU FOR CLARIFYING THAT.
I JUST WANTED

[Captioner] 20:42:28
 TO, WITH WHAT IT'S

[Captioner] 20:42:31
 
BEEN WRITTEN I THOUGHT THERE 
WERE SOME LAWS THE THAT ARE IN 


[Captioner] 20:42:35
PROCESS THAT ARE ALREADY IN THE 
BOOKS THAT COVER RETALIATION 
THAT

[Captioner] 20:42:38
 COVER RENT INCREASE OVER 5% 
BECAUSE I THOUGHT

[Captioner] 20:42:41
 THOSE WERE 
ALREADY -- WHETHER IT

[Captioner] 20:42:44
 WAS THE 
COUNTY OR WHETHER IT'S RUN BY 
THE STATE, THOSE THINGS

[Captioner] 20:42:47
 ARE 
IMPLEMENTED WHEN YOU SIGN RENTAL 
AGREEMENTS THAT THESE THINGS ARE

[Captioner] 20:42:49
 
STATED IN THERE AS PART OF THE 
LAW.


[Captioner] 20:42:52
THAT YOU WOULD NOT BE

[Captioner] 20:42:55
 -- NOT 
NOTIFIED IF THERE WAS AN 
INCREASE BY A CERTAIN AMOUNT

[Captioner] 20:42:58
 OF 
DAYS THAT THERE WOULD BE AN 
INCREASE AND THE

[Captioner] 20:43:02
 RETALIATION, 
THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING ELSE 
THAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED, YOU 


[Captioner] 20:43:06
KNOW, UNDER THE HOUSING LAWS TO

[Captioner] 20:43:09
 
PROTECT THE TENANTS.
SO

[Captioner] 20:43:12
 I DON'T TOTALLY UNDERSTAND 
THE GAP BECAUSE I'M NOT AN

[Captioner] 20:43:15
 
EXPERT IN IT BUT I JUST THOUGHT 
THAT SOME OF THOSE 


[Captioner] 20:43:18
RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WEREN'T 
ADOPTED, I'M JUST THINKING

[Captioner] 20:43:21
 OUT 
LOUD, THAT SOME OF THE THINGS 
THAT I HAVE READ IN THE

[Captioner] 20:43:25
 PAST 
THEY ARE IN AND ON THE BOOKS TO 
PROTECT

[Captioner] 20:43:28
 THE TENANTS.
THAT'S PART OF THE TENANTS' 
RIGHTS ALREADY

[Captioner] 20:43:31
.
AND I'M JUST TRYING TO ADD WHAT 
IS IT THAT WE'RE NOT

[Captioner] 20:43:34
 GETTING, 
EXCEPT IF YOU ARE ASKING

[Captioner] 20:43:37
 US DID 
YOU RESEARCH, I UNDERSTAND THAT 
PART.


[Captioner] 20:43:40
BUT THE BOTTOM LINE OF USING OUR 
STAFF TO TAKE AWAY

[Captioner] 20:43:44
 FROM COURT 
SERVICES, I'M JUST TRYING TO 
FIGURE

[Captioner] 20:43:47
 OUT, WHAT IS THE -- WHAT 
ARE WE MISSING HERE

[Captioner] 20:43:51
?
AND THINGS LIKE THAT.
BECAUSE I KNOW WE'VE HAD

[Captioner] 20:43:54
 A LOT 
OF STORM DAMAGE, A LOT OF OTHER 
THINGS THAT

[Captioner] 20:43:58
 WE WOULD LIKE TO 
HAVE OUR STAFF HELP OUT

[Captioner] 20:44:01
 OTHERS 
AT THIS POINT, INSTEAD OF 
SPENDING MORE TIME DOING 


[Captioner] 20:44:04
RESEARCH ON WHAT OTHERS ARE 
DOING.
I'M JUST TRYING TO FIND

[Captioner] 20:44:07
 OUT 
WHERE'S THE GAP.
>> Councilmember Kassan:   THE

[Captioner] 20:44:10
 
CITY OF FREMONT OF ALL THE 
CITIES IN ALAMEDA COUNTY, WE ARE 


[Captioner] 20:44:13
ONE OF THE ONES THAT HAS THE 
LEAST AMOUNT OF RENT

[Captioner] 20:44:17
ER 
PROTECTIONS, WE REALLY DON'T 
HAVE MUCH IN THE WAY OF

[Captioner] 20:44:20
 RENTER 
PROTECTIONS, WE DO HAVE A RENT 
REVIEW BOARD

[Captioner] 20:44:23
 BUT IT IS 100% 
NONBINDING.
SO THE REQUEST IS

[Captioner] 20:44:26
 TO LOOK AND 
SEE WHAT OTHER CITIES ARE DOING 
BECAUSE MANY

[Captioner] 20:44:29
 CITIES ARE DOING 
MORE THAN WE'RE DOING.
I DON'T KNOW IF WE ARE

[Captioner] 20:44:32
 THE 
LOWEST OF ALL CITIES IN ALAMEDA 
COUNTY BUT WE ARE

[Captioner] 20:44:35
 CERTAINLY 
AMONG THEM IN TERMS OF RENTER 
PROTECTION.


[Captioner] 20:44:38
SO THE IDEA IS TO LOOK AT WHAT'S 
NOT CURRENTLY

[Captioner] 20:44:41
 BEING DONE.
OBVIOUSLY WE WOULDN'T LOOK AT 
THINGS THAT DON'T NEED

[Captioner] 20:44:44
 TO BE 
LOOKED AT.
BUT THESE WERE SPECIFIC THINGS 


[Captioner] 20:44:47
THAT WERE FLAGGED AS -- BY THE 
STAFF AS NEEDING TO BE

[Captioner] 20:44:51
 
IMPLEMENTED IN 2019 AND THEY 
WERE

[Captioner] 20:44:54
 NOT IMPLEMENTED.
YOU KNOW, IF YOU LOOK AT THE 
LETTER WE

[Captioner] 20:44:57
 GOT FROM FREMONT FOR 
EVERYONE THEY DO TALK ABOUT THE 
RETALIATION

[Captioner] 20:45:00
 AS AN ISSUE.
IF YOU TALK TO RENTERS

[Captioner] 20:45:03
 IN 
FREMONT YOU'LL HEAR MANY OF THEM 
COMPLAINING ABOUT

[Captioner] 20:45:07
 THEIR 
RELATIONSHIP WITH THEIR LANDLORD 
AND FEELING THAT THE CURRENT

[Captioner] 20:45:09
 
ORDINANCE REALLY DOESN'T DO 
ANYTHING TO HELP THEM.


[Captioner] 20:45:12
YES, THERE IS A PROCESS.
I'M NOT SAYING YOU'RE NOT

[Captioner] 20:45:15
 DOING 
ANYTHING BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY YOU 
ARE HELPING PEOPLE RESOLVE SOME 


[Captioner] 20:45:19
OF THEIR ISSUES.
BUT IT'S 100% NONBINDING

[Captioner] 20:45:22
.
SO THERE IS REALLY NO RENTER 
PROTECTIONS IN FREMONT

[Captioner] 20:45:25
 RIGHT 
NOW.
AND SO THIS IS TO LOOK AT WHAT

[Captioner] 20:45:28
 
WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT 
GIVEN THAT MANY CITIES ARE

[Captioner] 20:45:31
 WAY 
BEYOND US IN TERMS OF WHAT'S 
BEEN IMPLEMENTED

[Captioner] 20:45:35
.
>> Mayor Mei:   SO THANK YOU.
I JUST WANTED TO AGAIN NOTE THE 


[Captioner] 20:45:39
TIME.
COUNCILMEMBER KENG DO YOU HAVE 
CLARIFYING QUESTIONS BECAUSE 


[Captioner] 20:45:43
OTHERWISE WE NEED TO TAKE A 
BREAK FOR THE STENO CAPTIONER

[Captioner] 20:45:46
 
AND WE HAVE 22 SPEAKERS BEFORE 
WE GO TO THE BUDGET

[Captioner] 20:45:49
.
>> Vice Mayor Keng:   THANK YOU 
MAYOR, MY QUESTION WAS ANSWERED

[Captioner] 20:45:52
 
EARLIER SO I CAN PASS.
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK.


[Captioner] 20:45:55
WE'LL TAKE A QUICK TEN

[Captioner] 20:45:59
 MINUTE 
BREAK BECAUSE IN FAIRNESS TO THE

[Captioner] 20:46:02
 
STENO CAPTIONER WE HAVE 22 
SPEAKERS THAT WILL

[Captioner] 20:46:05
 BE SPEAKING 
TO THIS ITEM.
AND WE

[Captioner] 20:46:09
 HAVE TO RETURN TO THE 
BUDGET

[Captioner] 20:46:12
.
[ RECESS ]

[Captioner] 20:56:07

>> Mayor Mei:   WELCOME.
WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO BRING 


[Captioner] 20:56:10
EVERYBODY BACK TO THE DAIS.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:56:13
BECAUSE ASIDE FROM THIS REEFERLT 
WE ALSO HAVE TWO

[Captioner] 20:56:16
 OTHER AGENDA 
ITEMS THIS EVENING STILL.
THE FLOOD

[Captioner] 20:56:19
 ORDINANCE AS WELL AS 
THE BUDGET.


[Captioner] 20:56:30
WHY DON'T WE BEGIN CALLING THE 
SPEAKERS.
I'M GOING

[Captioner] 20:56:33
 TO ASK EVERYONE, WE 
ARE GOING TO DO

[Captioner] 20:56:36
 TWO MINUTES 
EACH, IF YOU ARE GOING TO REPEAT 
ANOTHER SPEAKER

[Captioner] 20:56:40
, PLEASE FEEL 
FREE TO SAY YOU SUPPORT ANOTHER

[Captioner] 20:56:43
 
SPEAKER'S COMMENTS SO YOU DON'T 
HAVE TO REPEAT

[Captioner] 20:56:46
 YOUR COMMENTS 
ENTIRELY.
WE WOULD LIKE

[Captioner] 20:56:49
 TO START WITH CALL 
IN SPEAKERS.
WE HAVE SOME THAT ARE BOTH

[Captioner] 20:56:52
 IN

 JENNIE KASSAN

[Captioner] 20:57:46
MY NAME IS MACK.
LONG TIME RESIDENT

[Captioner] 20:57:49
 HERE IN 
FREMONT.
AND THE

[Captioner] 20:57:53
 CURRENT MEDIATION 
PROGRAM IN FREMONT

[Captioner] 20:57:56
 HAS BEEN 
CAREFULLY CRAFT AND DEBATE

[Captioner] 20:58:00
ED BY 
THE CITY COUNCIL.
MANY OF

[Captioner] 20:58:03
 THE COUNCILMEMBERS HERE 
TONIGHT CONTRIBUTE

[Captioner] 20:58:06
 GREAT DEAL 
THEN, AND THE PUBLIC COMMENTS

[Captioner] 20:58:10
 
WERE ALSO CAREFULLY CONSIDERED 
BACK

[Captioner] 20:58:13
 THEN.
THE PROGRAM HAS BEEN PROVEN

[Captioner] 20:58:16
 
WORKING REMARKABLY WELL

[Captioner] 20:58:19
 TO 
IMPROVE THE UNITY

[Captioner] 20:58:22
 AND CREATE A 
WIN WIN SITUATIONS FOR THE 
COMMUNITY

[Captioner] 20:58:25
 OF FREMONT.
I HAVEN'T SEEN

[Captioner] 20:58:29
 ANY REASON OR

[Captioner] 20:58:33
 
NECESSITY TO REVISIT SUCH A 
GREAT PROGRAM

[Captioner] 20:58:37
 AND NOT TO MENTION 
TO DISMANTLE AND FIX

[Captioner] 20:58:40
 IT, REPLACE 
IT BY SOMETHING WE DON'T EVEN

[Captioner] 20:58:43
 
REALLY KNOW WHETHER IT WORKS OR 
NOT.


[Captioner] 20:58:46
SO I'M STRONGLY

[Captioner] 20:58:49
 OPPOSED TO NEWLY 
PROPOSED REFERRAL PROGRAM

[Captioner] 20:58:54
.
>> Mayor Mei: 

[Captioner] 20:58:57
  YOU STILL HAVE 
30 SECONDS,

[Captioner] 20:59:00
 SORRY, THERE IS A 
WARNING THAT COMMENT UP

[Captioner] 20:59:03
 
AUTOMATICALLY.
20 SECONDS SORRY

[Captioner] 20:59:06
.
>> OKAY, IN TERMS OF EVICTION 
MORATORIUM

[Captioner] 20:59:09
 BECAUSE BASICALLY, 
FUNDAMENTALLY, THE PANDEMIC IS

[Captioner] 20:59:12
 
BEHIND US.
UNITED STATES.


[Captioner] 20:59:15
AND FREMONT IS ABSOLUTELY 
INCLUDED

[Captioner] 20:59:19
.
AND

[Captioner] 20:59:22
 -- OKAY.
OKAY.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.


[Captioner] 20:59:25

[Captioner] 20:59:32
 SITO.
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.
I ALSO WANTED TO

[Captioner] 20:59:35
 NOTE JUST FOR 
ALL THE PEOPLE HERE, THERE ARE

[Captioner] 20:59:38
 
MANY E-MAILS THAT WE RECEIVED, 
AND AS I STATED EARLIER THOSE

[Captioner] 20:59:41
 
WERE GIVEN TO US AND CONSIDERED 
PART OF OUR PUBLIC RECORDS

[Captioner] 20:59:43
 AND 
SENT TO ALL OF THE 
COUNCILMEMBERS.


[Captioner] 20:59:46
THANK YOU FOR ALL OF YOU WHO 
TOOK THE TIME.
NEXT

[Captioner] 20:59:49
 PLEASE.
>> I THINK FROM THE REFERRAL 
THAT

[Captioner] 20:59:53
 MS. CAST ANN HAS BROUGHT

[Captioner] 20:59:56
 KASSAN HAS BROUGHT UP

[Captioner] 20:59:59
, 
ONE OF THE THINGS SHE HASN'T 
MENTIONED IS BECAUSE OF THE

[Captioner] 21:00:02
 
LIMITATION, LET ME READ IT OUT 
LOUD

[Captioner] 21:00:05
, LIMITATION ON THE TYPE OF 
CRIMINAL

[Captioner] 21:00:09
 BACKGROUND CHECK THAT A 
LANDLORD MAY CONDUCT ON 
POTENTIAL TENANTS

[Captioner] 21:00:12
.
MR. SHAO HAS

[Captioner] 21:00:16
 BROUGHT UP, ANY 
DISCRIMINATION ON PEOPLE 
CURRENTLY

[Captioner] 21:00:19
 RENTING OR AFFECTING 
OUR -- BETWEEN THE

[Captioner] 21:00:22
 LANDLORD AND 
THE TENANT RELATIONSHIP, THIS IS 
ONE THING THAT I WOULD LIKE

[Captioner] 21:00:25
 TO 
ASK.
AND I WOULD LIKE TO --

[Captioner] 21:00:28
 I WOULD 
ALSO LIKE TO MENTION TO THE

[Captioner] 21:00:31
 
WHOLE COUNCILMEMBERS, THE BOARD 
OF COUNCIL,

[Captioner] 21:00:35
 THIS IS CALLED 
FREMONT CAPITALISM.
WE

[Captioner] 21:00:38
 HAVE TWO PERSON TRADING,

[Captioner] 21:00:41
 THE 
BUYER AND THE SELLER, OKAY?
BOTH

[Captioner] 21:00:44
 SIDES WILL HAVE TO BE -- 
AGREED

[Captioner] 21:00:48
 UPON UPON THE TERMS AND 
CONDITION THAT THEY

[Captioner] 21:00:51
 AGREE UPON 
TO TRADE, OKAY?
RENTING IS ALSO

[Captioner] 21:00:54
 ONE PART OF THE 
TRADING SYSTEM

[Captioner] 21:00:58
 HERE IN FREMONT 
IN ANY OF THE CIVILIZATION THAT 
YOU CAN

[Captioner] 21:01:01
 THINK OF, OKAY?
SO THE LAST OF THE CITY

[Captioner] 21:01:04
 GET 
THEIR HANDS INTO THIS KIND OF A 
SITUATION THE

[Captioner] 21:01:07
 MORE COMPATIBLE 
THAT WE BECOME.
THE MORE RESTRICTION THAT THE

[Captioner] 21:01:11
 
CITY WANT TO IMPLEMENTED, THAT 
WILL AFFECT

[Captioner] 21:01:14
 THE FUTURE HOUSING 
SUPPLY, AND

[Captioner] 21:01:17
 ALSO, AFFECT THE

[Captioner] 21:01:21
 
FUTURE PRICE

[Captioner] 21:01:24
 RENT -- PRICE ON 
RENTAL PROPERTY, AND WOULD I 
LIKE TO MAKE SURE

[Captioner] 21:01:29
 THAT US, AS 
HOUSING PROVIDERS,

[Captioner] 21:01:32
 DID NOT GET 
DISCRIMINATED ON BECAUSE I HAVE 
A GROUP OF PEOPLE

[Captioner] 21:01:36
 THAT WILLING 
TO RENT ON ANY OF THE

[Captioner] 21:01:39
 
MARGINALIZED PEOPLE THAT THEY 
HAVE ALREADY SERVED

[Captioner] 21:01:42
 THEIR TERM 
IN THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM.
OKAY?


[Captioner] 21:01:45
SO WE GET FAIR TREATMENT.
WE SHOULD GET FAIR

[Captioner] 21:01:48
 TREATMENT AS 
HOUSING PROVIDER AS WELL.
THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 21:01:52

>> Alberto Quintanilla:   OUR 
NEXT SPEAKER IS CHUNG.


[Captioner] 21:02:06
>> COUNCILMEMBER, JENNIE

[Captioner] 21:02:09
 KASSAN 
BACON

[Captioner] 21:02:13
.
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT I WANT TO 
ASK

[Captioner] 21:02:17
, ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?
DESPITE WHAT YOU

[Captioner] 21:02:20
 JUST COMMENTED, 
IN OFFERING THE SO-CALLED FAIR

[Captioner] 21:02:24
 
CHANCE THEREBY FORCING HOUSING 
PROVIDERS TO NOT

[Captioner] 21:02:27
 CONDUCT 
BACKGROUND CHECKS,

[Captioner] 21:02:30
 CRIMINAL 
BACKGROUND CHECKS WHEN RENTING 
OTHER PROPERTIES

[Captioner] 21:02:33
 WHICH WILL 
INVITE OTHER CRIMINALS TO LIVE 
IN OUR NEIGHBORHOODS

[Captioner] 21:02:37
.
THIS IS AN IRRESPONSIBLE IDEA

[Captioner] 21:02:41
.
MODEL RESEARCHERS HAVE SHOWN 
THAT MORE THAN 50%

[Captioner] 21:02:45
 OF INMATES 
ARE REARRESTED WITHIN THREE 
YEARS OF GET

[Captioner] 21:02:48
TING OUT OF URANIUM.
DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT AN 
ELECTED LEGISLATOR

[Captioner] 21:02:51
 WHO IS 
SUPPOSED TO REPRESENT THE PEOPLE

[Captioner] 21:02:54
 
OF THE CITY THE MOST BASIC THING 
YOU HAVE TO DO IS NOT PUT

[Captioner] 21:02:57
 OUR 
COMMUNITY IN DANGER.
YET IN YOUR CRAZY PURSUIT OF

[Captioner] 21:03:01
 
YOUR DOGMATIC IDEOLOGY, YOU

[Captioner] 21:03:06
 HAVE 
CHOSEN TO SET ASIDE

[Captioner] 21:03:09
 THE SAFETY 
OF OUR FREMONT

[Captioner] 21:03:12
 RESIDENTS.
OUR RESIDENTS ARE ROCKED, OUR 
CARS

[Captioner] 21:03:15
 ARE STOLEN, OUR HOUSES ARE 
BROKEN INTO AND OUR PEOPLE

[Captioner] 21:03:19
 ARE 
PHYSICALLY BEATEN UP.
HOW MUCH MORE

[Captioner] 21:03:22
 CHAOS DO WE NEED 
BEFORE YOU EVEN REALIZE THAT WE

[Captioner] 21:03:25
 
HAVE A CRIME PROBLEM?
AND THE LAST THING THAT WE NEED

[Captioner] 21:03:28
 
IS TO CREATE THE CONDITIONS TO 
MAKE OUR COMMUNITY LESS SAFE

[Captioner] 21:03:32
.
TO THE REST OF THE CITY COUNCIL, 
PLEASE DO NOT

[Captioner] 21:03:35
 CONSIDER A 
REFERRAL.
YOUR DAY IS NOT A

[Captioner] 21:03:39
 PROBLEM THAT 
IS TO BE FIXED.
IT IS A PROBLEM THAT SHE JUST 


[Captioner] 21:03:40
MADE UP.
THANK YOU.
[APPLAUSE]


[Captioner] 21:03:44
>> Alberto Quintanilla:   OUR 
NEXT SPEAKER IS CHUN C

[Captioner] 21:03:47
HI MA.


[Captioner] 21:03:55
>> GOOD EVENING.
MY NAME IS CHUN CHI

[Captioner] 21:03:59
 MA, A LONG 
TIME RESIDENT OF FREMONT AND A 
MEMBER

[Captioner] 21:04:02
 OF BHN.
FIRST CALIFORNIA HAS THE

[Captioner] 21:04:05
 MOST 
EXTENSIVE RENTER PROTECTION LAW, 
SECOND ONLY

[Captioner] 21:04:08
 TO NEW YORK.
BUT WHERE DID IT

[Captioner] 21:04:12
 GET US, BOTH OF 
US?
MANY OF THE TENANT

[Captioner] 21:04:15
 EVICTION JUST 
CAUSE

[Captioner] 21:04:18
 EVICTION IN CALIFORNIA 
STATE LAW.
NO NEED

[Captioner] 21:04:22
 FOR FREMONT TO REINVENT 
THE WHEEL.
SECOND, ANY

[Captioner] 21:04:25
 MORE RULES AND 
REGULATIONS WILL NOT ADD

[Captioner] 21:04:28
 A 
SINGLE UNIT OF SUPPLY, WHICH IS 
THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE

[Captioner] 21:04:31
 HOUSING 
CRISIS WHICH SADLY CAN LEAD TO 
REDUCTION IN INVENTORY

[Captioner] 21:04:35
.
WHICH SUCH AN INTENT 
CONSEQUENCES

[Captioner] 21:04:38
 WILL LEAD TO HIGHER 
RENT AND WILL HURT EVERY

[Captioner] 21:04:41
 -- THE 
VERY PERSON THAT YOU TRY TO 
PROTECT AND HELP.


[Captioner] 21:04:47
AND ALSO, THE CITY COUNCIL 
MENTIONED ABOUT

[Captioner] 21:04:50
 LOOK AT THE 
OTHER CITIES.
SERVE NEARBY

[Captioner] 21:04:53
 MENTIONED WITH A 
RENTAL

[Captioner] 21:04:56
 LAW FOR EXAMPLE, SAN 
FRANCISCO, OAKLAND, BERKELEY 
THEY

[Captioner] 21:04:59
 HAVE MUCH, MUCH WORSE 
TENANT-OWNER RELATIONSHIP AND

[Captioner] 21:05:02
 
THE HIGHEST REPRESENT.
NONE OF THOSE CITIES ARE

[Captioner] 21:05:06
 A 
SHIENL EXAMPLE FOR FREMONT AND 
WE ARE RANKED NUMBER

[Captioner] 21:05:09
 1 IN THE 
U.S.
I'M REALLY GLAD WE DON'T WANT

[Captioner] 21:05:12
 TO 
ADOPT TRYING TO LEARN FROM THOSE 
CITIES.


[Captioner] 21:05:15
I HOPE WE STAY

[Captioner] 21:05:19
 IN WITH OUR OWN 
APPROACH.
THE SIMILAR

[Captioner] 21:05:22
 TENANT PROTECTION 
PROPOSAL WAS SOUNDLY REJECTED BY

[Captioner] 21:05:25
 
ALL FOUR ALAMEDA BOARD OF 
SUPERVISORS

[Captioner] 21:05:28
 LAST TUESDAY NIGHT 
AND PUSHED BACK TO THE 
COMMITTEE.


[Captioner] 21:05:31
SO I JUST WONDER WHY FREMONT 
CITY COUNCIL WANTS

[Captioner] 21:05:34
 TO ADOPT 
SOMETHING THAT IS BEING REJECTED 
BY OUR

[Captioner] 21:05:38
 BOARD OF SUPERVISORS, 
DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.
LASTLY, STATE LAW

[Captioner] 21:05:41
 REQUIRED SEX 
OFFENDER, THAT

[Captioner] 21:05:45
 SOMEBODY ALREADY 
MENTIONED CHUNG

[Captioner] 21:05:48
 ALREADY 
MENTIONED THAT.
CONCLUSION OLD SAYING IN

[Captioner] 21:05:50
 AMERICA 
WE ARE ALREADY INDEED WHOLE AS 
IS.


[Captioner] 21:05:53
THE SAME THING IS

[Captioner] 21:05:56
 TO STOP 
DIGGING .
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 21:06:00
>> Alberto Quintanilla:   OUR 
NEXT SPEAKER

[Captioner] 21:06:04
 IS GIN

[Captioner] 21:06:07
 ME YANG.


[Captioner] 21:06:10
>> GOOD EVENING, MAYOR AND CITY 
COUNCIL.

[Captioner] 21:06:13

MY NAME IS GIN ME YANG.

[Captioner] 21:06:16

I'M A LONG TIME RESIDENT OF 
FREMONT.


[Captioner] 21:06:19
I URGE TO THE COUNCILS TO REJECT

[Captioner] 21:06:22
 
THE PROPOSAL IN

[Captioner] 21:06:25
 AGENDA 7.82.
SO I

[Captioner] 21:06:28
 DON'T WANT TO REPEAT THAT 
MUCH

[Captioner] 21:06:32
 ABOUT THE BACKGROUND CHECK 
AND THE COMMITTEE SAFETY

[Captioner] 21:06:35
.
BUT I JUST WANT TO TALK ABOUT 
THE CALIFORNIA

[Captioner] 21:06:38
 STATE LAW 
REQUIRES

[Captioner] 21:06:41
 SAYS ATTENDANCE TO 
LEAVE MORE THAN 2,000 FEET FROM

[Captioner] 21:06:45
 
A SCHOOL PARTS OR CHILDREN 
GATHER

[Captioner] 21:06:48
 PLACES.
THE IF ONE LIMITS

[Captioner] 21:06:51
 THE PROPERTY 
OWNER'S CONDUCTING

[Captioner] 21:06:54
 CRIMINAL 
BACKGROUND CHECK, HOW CAN SUCH 
STATE LAW FOLLOW

[Captioner] 21:06:57
?
WE DON'T WANT TO BREAK THE STATE 
LAW.


[Captioner] 21:07:00
WE JUST FOLLOW, WE STILL CAN 
REMEMBER

[Captioner] 21:07:03
 SOME CASES HAPPEN IN 
OUR

[Captioner] 21:07:07
 COMMUNITY.
SO THIS KIND OF BACKGROUND ISSUE

[Captioner] 21:07:10

ISSUE, THE CRIMINAL ISSUE, SO WE 
DON'T WANT

[Captioner] 21:07:13
 TO SEE IT HAPPEN 
AGAIN.
AS

[Captioner] 21:07:17
 A CONCERNED PARENT, LIVE IN 
THIS GOOD COMMUNITY,

[Captioner] 21:07:20
 WE JUST 
HOPE FREMONT

[Captioner] 21:07:23
 STILL IS THE 
HAPPIEST CITY IN THE WHOLE 
UNITED STATES

[Captioner] 21:07:26
.
THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 21:07:58
ING THAT A

[Captioner] 21:08:01
 
TYPICAL FREMONT RESIDENT, IPSO 
FACTO AS SOMEONE

[Captioner] 21:08:04
 WHO MIGHT NOT 
RECOGNIZE THE EXISTENCE OF

[Captioner] 21:08:07
 A 
LUNAR NEW YEAR

[Captioner] 21:08:11
 THEREFORE 
PERPETUATING THE FALSE DIVIDE.
I

[Captioner] 21:08:14
 MIGHT NOT SOUND OR LOOK LIKE A

[Captioner] 21:08:18
 
TYPICAL FREMONT CITIZEN, I WOULD 
LOVE

[Captioner] 21:08:21
 TO HAVE MY WIFE HEARD 
WITHOUT PREJUDICE TONIGHT.

[Captioner] 21:08:24

I AM DEEPLY CONCERNED THAT WE 
ARE RISKING

[Captioner] 21:08:28
 THE LOSS OF LIFE 
LIBERTY AND PURSUIT OF

[Captioner] 21:08:31
 
HAPPINESS, DUE TO A POLICY 
PROPOSAL THAT WILL

[Captioner] 21:08:34
 DRASTICALLY 
REDUCE OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT

[Captioner] 21:08:37
 
CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECKS, WHEN 
A LAW ENFORCEMENT

[Captioner] 21:08:41
 OFFICER RUNS A 
LICENSE PLATE OR

[Captioner] 21:08:44
 A CRIMINAL 
BACKGROUND CHECK, THAT DO SO NOT

[Captioner] 21:08:47
 
TO INFRINGE ON THE RIGHTS OF 
THOSE

[Captioner] 21:08:50
 WHO ARE BEING CHECKED BUT 
TO GET A FULL PROFILE

[Captioner] 21:08:54
 ON THE 
BACKGROUND OF THAT PERSON.
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, I

[Captioner] 21:08:57
 HAVE 
MEMORIES DATING BACK TO 2019, 
WHEN

[Captioner] 21:09:00
 WE THE PEOPLE TRIED TO MAKE 
OUR VOICES HEARD, AND

[Captioner] 21:09:04
 WERE 
UNABLE TO GET YOUR 
ACKNOWLEDGMENT AND RESPONSE AND

[Captioner] 21:09:07
 
THEREFORE GATHERED ON PUBLIC 
PROPERTY IN ATTEMPT TO MAKE OUR 


[Captioner] 21:09:11
 
VOICE HEARD AND WE WERE TOLD 
THAT YOU

[Captioner] 21:09:14
 WERE CONCERNED ABOUT 
YOUR SAFETY, BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T 
KNOW THE

[Captioner] 21:09:17
 INCIDENCE OF PEOPLE 
THAT GATHERED ON PUBLIC 
PROPERTY.


[Captioner] 21:09:20
YOUR HUSBAND WAS VERY KIND TO 
COME OUT AND MEET WITH US.
TODAY

[Captioner] 21:09:23
 YOU SIT HERE TO PROPOSE 
MEASURES THAT WE SEVERELY LIMIT

[Captioner] 21:09:27
 
OUR ABILITY TO RUN CRIMINAL ARE 
BACKGROUND

[Captioner] 21:09:30
 CHECKS THAT ARE 
CONSISTENT WITH THE BOUNDARIES 
OF LAW.


[Captioner] 21:09:33
AND IT IS ALSO INTERESTING THAT

[Captioner] 21:09:36
 
YOU WILL USE THE NH

[Captioner] 21:09:39
LP, SHELTER 
TO PROVIDE

[Captioner] 21:09:43
 PASSIVE INCOME STREAM 
FOR LANDLORDS

[Captioner] 21:09:46
 UNQUOTE.
IT TURNS OUT THAT THEY WERE 
REFERENCING THE

[Captioner] 21:09:49
 ARTICLE FROM THE 
ONION AND NOT A REAL POLICY 
PAPER.

[Captioner] 21:09:52

SO LET'S NOT MAKE PUBLIC SAFETY 
A SAD GUY OR A

[Captioner] 21:09:54
 JOKE IN THE CITY.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR 
CONSIDERATION.

.
I'M HERE IN FRONT OF COUNCIL TO 
REJECT

[Captioner] 21:12:07
 7.82.
CALIFORNIA ALREADY

[Captioner] 21:12:10
 HAVE STRAIGHT 
TENANT PROTECT LAW

[Captioner] 21:12:13
, LIKE AB 
1482.


[Captioner] 21:12:16
RESTRICTION FOR RENTAL HOUSING.
I AGREE

[Captioner] 21:12:19
 WITH CHUNG CHI COMMENT.
WE ALL KNOW THE MORE

[Captioner] 21:12:22
 REGULATION, 
THE LESS RENTAL UNIT ON THE 
MARKET.

[Captioner] 21:12:26

JUST LIKE BERKELEY.
IT IS VERY HARD FOR THE COLLEGE

[Captioner] 21:12:29
 
STUDENT AND THE LOCAL RESIDENTS 
TO FIND A UNIT

[Captioner] 21:12:32
 BECAUSE THEY 
DON'T HAVE ENOUGH RENTAL UNIT ON 
THE MARKET

[Captioner] 21:12:36
.
AND JUST LIKE THE HOUSING STAFF

[Captioner] 21:12:40
 
COMMENT, FREMONT HAS A RUN

[Captioner] 21:12:43
 
MEDIATION PROGRAM AND IT IS 
WORKING WELL AND

[Captioner] 21:12:46
 IT'S 
SUCCESSFUL.
NO BAD FEEDBACK SO FAR.

[Captioner] 21:12:49

IF THE SYSTEM IS WORKING,

[Captioner] 21:12:52
 WHY 
BOTHER TO MAKE CHANGE OF IT

[Captioner] 21:12:57
?
JESSICA

[Captioner] 21:13:00
'S LAW HAS SURPASSED

[Captioner] 21:13:03
 IN  
2006

[Captioner] 21:13:07
.
THIS LAW HAS OVER 70%

[Captioner] 21:13:10
 VOTERS 
VOTE YES.
THIS LAW

[Captioner] 21:13:13
 PROHIBITS ANYONE ON

[Captioner] 21:13:17
 
CALIFORNIA'S SEXUAL OFFEND

[Captioner] 21:13:20
ER 
REGISTRATIONS FOR LEAVE WITHIN

[Captioner] 21:13:24
 
2,000 FEET OF SCHOOL OR PARK.
IF ONE LIMIT THE

[Captioner] 21:13:27
 LANDLORD 
CONDUCTING CRIMINAL BACKGROUND 
CHECKS, HOW CAN WE

[Captioner] 21:13:30
 PROTECT OUR 
KIDS AND FAMILIES

[Captioner] 21:13:34
?
UNTIL THIS SUMMER 

[Captioner] 21:13:37
OUR FAMILY

WE LIKE HERE AND

[Captioner] 21:13:40
 WE ENJOY TO BE

[Captioner] 21:13:44

DON'T TURN OUR

[Captioner] 21:13:50
 BEAUTIFUL FREMONT

[Captioner] 21:14:30
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, THANK YOU 
FOR PROVIDING

[Captioner] 21:14:33
 OUR E-MAIL AND THE 
COULDN'T WAS BASED ON

[Captioner] 21:14:36
 THE 
INFORMATION YOU PROVIDED ON YOUR 
L REFERRAL IN THE

[Captioner] 21:14:39
 AGENDAS.
WE DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS BASED ON 
EXAMPLES.


[Captioner] 21:14:42
BUT YOU DID PROVE OUR POINT AND 
I WANTED TO POINT OUT

[Captioner] 21:14:45
 THAT THE 
STATEMENTS THAT YOU MADE ARE 
MERELY SPECULATION.


[Captioner] 21:14:48
NO VALID DATA IS

[Captioner] 21:14:51
 PROVIDED TO 
SHOW THAT THE LAWS ALREADY IN 
PLACE

[Captioner] 21:14:54
 SHOULD BE CHANGED.
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN HAS ASKED 
THE CITY

[Captioner] 21:14:58
 STAFF TO

[Captioner] 21:15:01
 REVIEW THE 
CASES ALREADY PROVIDED IN THE

[Captioner] 21:15:04
 
ORDINANCE.
THIS ORDINANCE SPECIFICALLY SAYS 


[Captioner] 21:15:07
THAT LANDLORDS CANNOT TAKE ANY 
RETALIATORY ACTION AGAINST

[Captioner] 21:15:10
 THEIR 
TENANTS.
IF THEY DO IT WILL BE VOID AND 


[Captioner] 21:15:14
REMEDIED BY A CIVIL PENALTY OF 
UP TO $2,000.

[Captioner] 21:15:17

THAT'S STATED IN YOUR RENT 
REVIEW ORDINANCE.

[Captioner] 21:15:20

ON TOP OF THAT THE ORDINANCE 
CALIFORNIA CIVIL LAW

[Captioner] 21:15:24
 ALSO STATES 
THAT IT IS ILLEGAL FOR THE 
LANDLORD TO

[Captioner] 21:15:27
 RETALIATE AGAINST A 
TENANT

[Captioner] 21:15:30
 FOR EXERCISING HIS OR HER 
CIVIL RIGHTS, THAT IS

[Captioner] 21:15:34
 CIVIL LAW.
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN ALSO STATES

[Captioner] 21:15:37
 
SHE WANTS EVIDENCE TO EXPLAIN A 
RENT INCREASE OVER 75%

[Captioner] 21:15:40
.
AGAIN THAT IS MENTIONED IN YOUR 
RENT ORDINANCE, IT IS

[Captioner] 21:15:43
 IN THERE.
IT'S PRESENTED THERE AND ALSO, 
STAFF MENTION

[Captioner] 21:15:46
ED THAT THE 
DISPUTES HAVE BEEN RESOLVED

[Captioner] 21:15:50
 WITH 
THE RENT REVIEW BOARDS.
THAT MEANS THAT THERE IS NO

[Captioner] 21:15:53
 
VALID PROBLEM IN FREMONT.
COUNCILMEMBER

[Captioner] 21:15:56
 HAS EXPRESSED 
CONCERN THAT THE ENDING OF THE 
ALAMEDA COUNTY

[Captioner] 21:15:59
 EVICTION 
MORATORIUM COULD RESULT IN A 
CRISIS OF

[Captioner] 21:16:04
 EVICTION THAT IS -- 
MAY I CONTINUE?
>> Mayor Mei:   SORRY,

[Captioner] 21:16:07
 I THINK 
THAT WE HAVE THE SAME LIMIT FOR 
EVERY PERSON BUT THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 21:16:10
>> THANK YOU.

NEXT SPEAKER IS JOHN HINES

ED BY TWAN EN.

[Captioner] 21:16:19

>> HELLO EVERYONE.
THIS IS ABOUT SOME ELEMENTS OF 


[Captioner] 21:16:22
THE REFERRAL.
IN THE EITHER 70s THE U.S.

[Captioner] 21:16:25
 RAN 
INTO PETROLEUM SUPPLY SHOCKS

[Captioner] 21:16:29
.
UNFORTUNATELY THE NIXON 
ADMINISTRATION WAS IN

[Captioner] 21:16:32
 ITS THIRD 
YEAR OF SOME ILL ADVISED PRICE 
CONTROLS WHICH

[Captioner] 21:16:35
 ARTIFICIALLY HELD 
DOWN THE PRICE OF GAS SO THE 
MARKET

[Captioner] 21:16:39
 COULDN'T CLEAR THE 
SHOCKS.
MANY GAS STATIONS

[Captioner] 21:16:42
 ACTUALLY RAN 
OUT OF GAS AND LINES OF CARS 
WRAPPED AROUND THE

[Captioner] 21:16:46
 BLOCK.
NOW IN THE MOST RECENT THREE 
YEARS

[Captioner] 21:16:49
 ALAMEDA COUNTY HAS BEEN 
ARTIFICIALLY HOLDING THE

[Captioner] 21:16:52
 PRICE 
OF RENT TO ZERO FOR THOSE 
TENANTS WHO FIGURED OUT THAT 


[Captioner] 21:16:55
THEY COULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE 
EVICTION MORATORIUM AND PAY 
NOTHING

[Captioner] 21:16:58
.
THIS WAS UNFAIR TO LANDLORDS, 
AND TO

[Captioner] 21:17:02
 TENANTS WHO HAD 
DILIGENTLY PAID THEIR RENT.

[Captioner] 21:17:05

THE MORATORIUM WILL EXPIRE SOON 
AND THERE WAS

[Captioner] 21:17:08
 MUCH TALK LAST 
WEEK ABOUT A COMING TSUNAMI OF 
EVICTION

[Captioner] 21:17:11
S.
IF THERE IS SUCH A WAVE WE'LL 
KNOW THE CAUSE

[Captioner] 21:17:15
.
IT'S THE HANGOVER AFTER A

[Captioner] 21:17:19
 LONG  
BINGE WITH

[Captioner] 21:17:22
 SOME BAD MEDICINE.
WILL THERE BE SOME PRICE

[Captioner] 21:17:25
 
INCREASES, PROBABLY, WILL THERE 
BE SOME EVICTIONS,

[Captioner] 21:17:29
 YES, WILL 
EVERYBODY GET KICKED OUT, NO

[Captioner] 21:17:33
.
TENANTS AND LANDLORDS EXIST IN A 
SYMBIOTIC

[Captioner] 21:17:36
 RELATIONSHIP, THEY 
WILL WORK IT

[Captioner] 21:17:39
 OUT BY

[Captioner] 21:17:44
 THEMSELVES 
WIDE NIXON PRICE CONTROLS

[Captioner] 21:17:47
.
THAT WOULD BE TRYING TO

[Captioner] 21:17:53
 OVERCOME 
THE HANGOVER BY OPENING

[Captioner] 21:17:56
 ANOTHER 
BOTTLE.
PLEASE RESIST THE

[Captioner] 21:18:00
 TEMPTATION.
>> Alberto Quintanilla:  

[Captioner] 21:18:03
 
(SAYING NAMES).
>> HI I'M A DATA SCIENCE PERSON 


[Captioner] 21:18:06
AND I'D LIKE TO FACT CHECK 
THINGS WHEN THEY'RE NOT CORRECT.


[Captioner] 21:18:10
I HEARD COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN 
SAID THAT THERE'S

[Captioner] 21:18:13
 A SPIKE IN 
EVICTIONS.

[Captioner] 21:18:16

WHEN THE EVICTION MORATORIUM WAS 
LIFTED

[Captioner] 21:18:19
.
ACTUALLY, PEOPLE LOOKED INTO 
THIS.


[Captioner] 21:18:22
THE SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS 
REPORTER

[Captioner] 21:18:25
 WENT AROUND, DIFFERENT 
CITIES, AND LOOKED

[Captioner] 21:18:29
 AT EVICTION 
COURT FILINGS

[Captioner] 21:18:32
.
AND TRCT

[Captioner] 21:18:36
 TRACTED

[Captioner] 21:18:39
 LONGITUDINALLY, 
THERE WAS A SLIGHT UPTICK, I

[Captioner] 21:18:42
 
THINK THE HIGHEST WAS 40% BUT IF 
YOU ANALYSIS

[Captioner] 21:18:46
 THE DATA 
APPROPRIATELY, AND YOU LOOK, AND 
YOU

[Captioner] 21:18:49
 THINK JUST COMMON SENSE, WE 
HAVE AN

[Captioner] 21:18:53
 EVICTION MORATORIUM FOR 
THREE YEARS.
THAT

[Captioner] 21:18:56
 MEANS THERE'S A BACKLOG 
EVERY YEAR, THERE'S A BACKLOG.

[Captioner] 21:18:59

SO AFTER THREE YEARS WHEN YOU 
LIFT IT THERE SHOULD BE A

[Captioner] 21:19:03
 300% 
INCREASE COMPARED TO

[Captioner] 21:19:06
 
PRE-PANDEMIC LEVELS.
WE SEE A 40%

[Captioner] 21:19:09
 INCREASE.
AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS, 
EVICTIONS ACTUALLY

[Captioner] 21:19:12
 WENT DOWN.
THERE WAS RENTAL ASSISTANCE THAT 
CAME OUT

[Captioner] 21:19:16
.
PEOPLE SETTLED THINGS AND WORKED 
THINGS OUT.

[Captioner] 21:19:19

SO WHEN YOU QUOTE DATA, PLEASE

[Captioner] 21:19:23
 
LOOK AT REPUTABLE JOURNALS

[Captioner] 21:19:26
, AND 
NEWSPAPER SOURCES, ANALYZE THE 
DATA

[Captioner] 21:19:29
, AND INTERPRET 
APPROPRIATELY TO COME TO 
CONCLUSIONS

[Captioner] 21:19:32
 BEFORE YOU PROPOSE 
POLICIES

[Captioner] 21:19:36
 THAT ACTUALLY IS -- 
WELL INTENDED

[Captioner] 21:19:39
, BUT IT HAS 
CONSEQUENCES.
SO PLEASE

[Captioner] 21:19:42
.
THINK THROUGH WHAT YOU SAY, WHAT

[Captioner] 21:19:45
 
DATA YOU READ, AND ANALYZE IT SO

[Captioner] 21:19:48
 
THAT THE PUBLIC IS NOT HARMED.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

[Captioner] 21:20:02
GOOD EVENING MAYOR, AND ALL 
RESPECTED COUNCILS

.
MY NAME IS ANNIE HEE

[Captioner] 21:20:08
, I HAVE 
LIVED IN THE CITY FOR OVER 20 
YEARS, I'M PROUD

[Captioner] 21:20:11
 TO LIVE IN THE 
HAPPIEST CITY IN THE NATION.
HOWEVER

[Captioner] 21:20:14
 IN THE PAST YEAR WE HAVE 
HAD CONTINUOUS

[Captioner] 21:20:17
 INCREASE IN THE 
CRIME RATE, CONSIDERABLY HIGHER

[Captioner] 21:20:20
 
THAN NATIONAL AVERAGE ACROSS ALL 
THE COMMUNITIES IN AMERICA FROM 


[Captioner] 21:20:23
THE LARGEST TO THE SMALLEST, AND 
DURING COVID

[Captioner] 21:20:26
, AN OLD LADY WAS 
RAPED UNDER THE

[Captioner] 21:20:29
 SUN IN MY 
COMMUNITY.
AND I PERSONALLY

[Captioner] 21:20:34
 EXPERIENCED 
SOME ATTACKS FROM HOMELESS 
INDIVIDUALS

[Captioner] 21:20:38
.
SO WHAT I HEARD,

[Captioner] 21:20:41
 THIS PROPOSAL 
HAS THE COMPONENTS THAT LIMIT

[Captioner] 21:20:44
 
THE OWNER'S ABILITY TO CHECK THE 
BACKGROUND

[Captioner] 21:20:48
 TEEN CRIMINAL 
BACKGROUND, AND THIS IS 
ABSOLUTELY

[Captioner] 21:20:51
 RIDICULOUS.
DON'T GET ME WRONG.
I'M NOT RICH

[Captioner] 21:20:54
 ENOUGH.
I DON'T OWN A

[Captioner] 21:20:57
 RENTAL PROPERTY IN 
FREMONT.
I AM CONCERNED ABOUT MY KIDS

[Captioner] 21:21:00
.
I HAVE THREE KIDS AND ELDERS IN 
MY HOUSE.


[Captioner] 21:21:03
AND MY ELDERS SHE HAD A NEW 
PROBLEM, SHE

[Captioner] 21:21:06
 COULD NOT RUN WHEN 
CRIMINAL CHASE HER.
AND I'M

[Captioner] 21:21:09
 HERE REPRESENTING A LOT 
OF WORKING CLASS

[Captioner] 21:21:13
 PARENTS IN 
RESIDENCY IN FREMONT.
WE WORK REALLY HARD TO

[Captioner] 21:21:16
 EARN TO 
LIVE IN FREMONT.
PLEASE WHEN YOU ARE

[Captioner] 21:21:19
 ELECTED SIT 
ON THERE YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO 
PROTECT US.


[Captioner] 21:21:22
PROTECT OUR FAMILIES AND 
INTEREST.
NOT FOR

[Captioner] 21:21:25
 ANY OF OTHER

[Captioner] 21:21:32
 IDEOLOGICAL 
IDEA.
THIS IS A

[Captioner] 21:21:37
 DISASTROUS PROPOSAL, I 
URGE COUNCILMEMBERS,

[Captioner] 21:21:41
 THIS IS 
DON'T GO ON THE WRONG DIRECTION, 
YOU ARE SMARTER

[Captioner] 21:21:44
 THAN THIS.
FREMONT RESIDENTS DESERVE A

[Captioner] 21:21:48
 SAFE 
ENVIRONMENT BECAUSE WE EARN IT.
THANK YOU SO MUCH

BY LYNN DENG.
>> MY NAME

[Captioner] 21:21:58
 IS CHRISTOPHER HU.
THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY

[Captioner] 21:22:01
.
I WANT TO MAKE A COUPLE OF 
POINTS,

[Captioner] 21:22:05
 I RUN A RENTAL UNIT, FOR 
THE LAST

[Captioner] 21:22:08
 THREE YEARS I LOST 
ABOUT $60,000 AND I ONLY

[Captioner] 21:22:12
 GOT 
COMPENSATED ABOUT $20,000.
SOME

[Captioner] 21:22:15
 ARE COLLATERAL DAMAGE I'M 
RENTING

[Captioner] 21:22:19
 TO A COUPLE OF PEOPLE TO 
SHARE.
ONE OF THEM IS HARASSING

[Captioner] 21:22:22
 THE 
PEOPLE AND DON'T PAY THE RENT 
AND CAUSE ALL THESE ISSUES

[Captioner] 21:22:25
.
SO I DON'T THINK YOUR STATISTICS 
INCLUDE

[Captioner] 21:22:28
 THIS KIND OF SITUATIONS.
I THINK IN FREMONT WE HAVE A

[Captioner] 21:22:31
 LOT 
OF LANDLORDS HAVE THIS KIND OF 
SITUATION.


[Captioner] 21:22:34
SO SECOND OF ALL I WANT TO ASK 
YOU A QUESTION.
ARE YOU GOING

[Captioner] 21:22:37
 TO HIRE SOMEBODY 
WITH A CRIMINAL RECORD AS

[Captioner] 21:22:40
 A CITY 
EMPLOYEE?
IF YOU DO I THINK THAT'S

[Captioner] 21:22:43
 PRETTY 
CONVINCING THAT YOU COULD 
CONVINCE ALL

[Captioner] 21:22:46
 LANDLORDS NOT TO DO 
A CRIMINAL RECORD CHECK.
AND SO I

[Captioner] 21:22:51
 THINK, I MEAN YOU 
PROBABLY HAVE GOOD INTENTION TO 
HELP

[Captioner] 21:22:54
 THESE PEOPLE BUT I THINK IF 
YOU REALLY WANTED TO HELP THESE 
PEOPLE

[Captioner] 21:22:57
 SHOULD YOU GIVE THEM A 
JOB.
IF THEY GET A JOB THEY ARE

[Captioner] 21:23:00
 LESS 
LIKELY TO COMMIT CRIMINAL 
ACTIVITIES

[Captioner] 21:23:03
.
AND I THINK THAT'S MY POINT.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 21:23:11

 A FREMONT

AS

[Captioner] 21:23:29
 HAPPY CITY NATIONWIDE.
I'M ALSO A HOUSING PROVIDER

[Captioner] 21:23:32
 IN 
FREMONT FOR MANY YEARS.
I USED

[Captioner] 21:23:35
 TO LEASE MY TWO BEDROOMS 
FROM

[Captioner] 21:23:39
 MY HOME TO PEOPLE TO SHARE 
THE COST.
I

[Captioner] 21:23:42
 HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY ABOUT 
THE

[Captioner] 21:23:45
 AGENDA 7.8.2.
IF WE

[Captioner] 21:23:48
 CANNOT PERFORM BACKGROUND 
CHECK AND

[Captioner] 21:23:51
 CRIMINAL RECORD CHECK, 
I CAN'T IMAGINE HOW

[Captioner] 21:23:54
 TO SHARE 
ROOMS WITH A COMPLETE

[Captioner] 21:23:57
 STRANGER 
IN OUR HOME.
I CAN'T IMAGINE

[Captioner] 21:24:00
 WHAT IF MY NEXT 
DOOR NEIGHBOR USED

[Captioner] 21:24:03
 TO BE CHARGED 
WITH FELONY?
IT'S A BIG SAFETY CONCERN FOR

[Captioner] 21:24:07
 
OUR COMMUNITY.
HOUSING PROVIDER HAVE THE RIGHT

[Captioner] 21:24:10
 
TO KNOW THE BACKGROUND OF THE

[Captioner] 21:24:13
 
POTENTIAL TENANT.
SO THEY CAN MAKE THEIR

[Captioner] 21:24:16
 OWN 
DECISION.
I WOULD LIKE TO

[Captioner] 21:24:20
 ASK

[Captioner] 21:24:24
 COUNCIL 
JENNIE KASSAN,

[Captioner] 21:24:27

WOULD YOU INVITE PEOPLE THAT YOU 
DON'T

LIVE WITH YOU

[Captioner] 21:24:33
?
WOULD YOU

?
>> Mayor Mei:   TO CLARIFY, WE 
DON'T

[Captioner] 21:24:43
 GREAT 
PLEASE OPEN YOUR HOME TO THE

[Captioner] 21:25:23
 PARTICULARLY 
SINCE THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC THE

[Captioner] 21:25:25

[Captioner] 21:25:28
FOR TENANTS THEY ARE NOW ROBUST

PAYMENTS SINCE 2020

[Captioner] 21:25:54

LEFT OR WILL BE LEAVING

[Captioner] 21:25:57
 THE 
RENTAL HOUSING MARKET BECAUSE 
THEY SIMPLY CAN'T PAY

[Captioner] 21:26:00
 THE BILLS 
OR THEY SEE INCREASING LEVELS OF

[Captioner] 21:26:03
 
STATE, REGIONAL AND

 LOCAL 
REGULATIONS, WHEN A HOUSING

[Captioner] 21:26:11

PLEASE

[Captioner] 21:26:41
 ALAMEDA COUNTY 
SUPERVISORS REJECTED A SUITE OF 
ORDINANCE

[Captioner] 21:26:44
S, VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT 
HAS BEEN PROPOSED TONIGHT

[Captioner] 21:26:47
.
PLEASE CONSIDER THE UNINTENDED 
CONSEQUENCES OF ANY POLICY 


[Captioner] 21:26:50
MAKING YOU MAY DO AS A RESULT OF 
THIS REFERRAL.
THANKS.


[Captioner] 21:26:57
>> Alberto Quintanilla:   NEXT 
SPEAKER IS LISA DANS.


[Captioner] 21:27:01
>> GOOD EVENING AND THANK YOU 
FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK.
MY NAME IS

[Captioner] 21:27:04
 LISA DANS AND I LIVE 
IN THE

[Captioner] 21:27:08
 SUNDALE NEIGHBORHOOD IN 
FREMONT DISTRICT 4.
I'M

[Captioner] 21:27:11
 A VOLUNTEER AND A LEADERSHIP 
MEMBER OF FREMONT FOR EVERYONE.

[Captioner] 21:27:14

FREMONT FOR EVERYONE HAS 
OFFICIALLY ENDORSED THIS 


[Captioner] 21:27:17
REFERRAL.
AND PERSONALLY, I ALSO STRONGLY 
SUPPORT IT

[Captioner] 21:27:20
.
I AM VERY CONCERNED THAT A LOT 
OF PEOPLE WILL LOSE

[Captioner] 21:27:24
 THEIR 
HOUSING, WILL BECOME HOMELESS, 
WHEN THE

[Captioner] 21:27:28
 EVICTION MORATORIUM 
EXPIRES IN A FEW SHORT MONTHS

[Captioner] 21:27:32
.
IT'S TIME TO DO SOMETHING.
I'M REALLY GLAD

[Captioner] 21:27:35
 TO HEAR CITY 
MANAGER SHACKELFORD SAY

[Captioner] 21:27:38
 EARLIER 
THAT STAFF IS ALREADY LOOKING 
INTO THIS.

[Captioner] 21:27:41

AND ON TOP OF THIS I THINK THAT 
THIS REFERRAL IS A GREAT

[Captioner] 21:27:44
 IDEA.
THIS REFERRAL AS NOTED SIMPLY 
DIRECTS STAFF TO

[Captioner] 21:27:47
 LOOK INTO THE 
CURRENT STATUS OF THE RENT 
REVIEW

[Captioner] 21:27:51
 ORDINANCE AND MAKE 
UPDATED RECOMMENDATIONS BASED ON 
THE

[Captioner] 21:27:54
 CURRENT SITUATION.
AND IT WAS NOTED EARLIER THAT

[Captioner] 21:27:57
 
STAFF HAS LIMITED TIME.
HOWEVER, HOMELESSNESS IS ONE

[Captioner] 21:28:00
 OF 
OUR TOP PRIORITIES IN FREMONT, 
WHICH

[Captioner] 21:28:04
 WAS REITERATED AT THE 
RECENT COUNCIL RETREAT.

[Captioner] 21:28:07

THIS IS A CORE SERVICE AND IT IS 
AN URGENT ISSUE

[Captioner] 21:28:10
.
THIS IS EXACTLY THE TIME TO 
REEVALUATE IF OUR TENANT 


[Captioner] 21:28:13
PROTECTIONS ARE STRONG ENOUGH 
AND GIVE TENANTS A FAIR

[Captioner] 21:28:16
 CHANCE 
TO STAY HOUSED GIVEN UNIQUE 
CHALLENGE OF THE

[Captioner] 21:28:20
 EVICTION 
MORATORIUM AND I DO WANT

[Captioner] 21:28:23
 TO NOTE 
THAT THE CURRENT STATUS WITH

[Captioner] 21:28:26
 
RETALIATION PROTECTIONS BEING IN 
CIVIL

[Captioner] 21:28:29
 LAW PUTS THE BURDEN OF 
PROOF ON THE TENANT AND

[Captioner] 21:28:33
 IF 
YOU'RE A TENANT AND YOU'RE 
WORRIED THAT YOUR LANDLORD

[Captioner] 21:28:36
 IS 
ALREADY RETALIATING AGAINST YOU, 
AND

[Captioner] 21:28:40
 YOU'RE NOT 100% CONFIDENT 
YOU ARE GOING TO

[Captioner] 21:28:43
 WIN A LAWSUIT, 
DO YOU REALLY THINK YOUR 
LANDLORD IS GOING TO LIKE

[Captioner] 21:28:46
 YOU 
BETTER WHEN YOU SUE THEM?
PROBABLY NOT.

[Captioner] 21:28:49

SO THAT'S A DETERRENT.
SO JUST BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T

[Captioner] 21:28:52
 
NECESSARILY SEEN PEOPLE ENFORCE 
THEIR RIGHTS IN THIS WAY IT 


[Captioner] 21:28:55
MIGHT BE BECAUSE WE REALIZE IT 
IS AGAINST THEIR INTEREST.
SO I URGE YOU

[Captioner] 21:28:57
 TO SUPPORT THIS 
REFERRAL.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 21:29:02
>> Alberto Quintanilla:   OUR 
NEXT SPEAKER IS JENNIFER

[Captioner] 21:29:05
 L.


[Captioner] 21:29:08
>> HI.
MY NAME IS JENNIFER

[Captioner] 21:29:11
 LU.
I'M THE PRESIDENT OF B

[Captioner] 21:29:15
 BAHN, I 
HAVE

[Captioner] 21:29:19
 A FEW QUESTIONS.


[Captioner] 21:29:22
FOR COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN.
WHAT'S THE

[Captioner] 21:29:25
 PERCENTAGE INCREASE 
OF YOUR

[Captioner] 21:29:28
 OWN PGN YOU BUILD THIS 
YEAR?
DO YOU OWN

[Captioner] 21:29:31
 YOUR OWN HOME?
IF SO DO YOU GO TO

[Captioner] 21:29:34
 HOME DEPOT AT 
ALL?
HOW IS THE CURRENT

[Captioner] 21:29:37
 MATERIAL 
PRICING?
COMPARED TO A COUPLE OF YEARS 


[Captioner] 21:29:41
AGO?
HOW ABOUT THE LABOR COST

[Captioner] 21:29:45
 OF A 
PLUMBER, A PAINTER?
WHAT'S THE

[Captioner] 21:29:49
 NATIONAL INFLATION 
RATE THIS YEAR

[Captioner] 21:29:52
?
ARE ANY OF THE ABOVE NUMBERS

[Captioner] 21:29:56
 
BELOW 5%?
WHY DO YOU

[Captioner] 21:29:59
 THINK IT MAKES SENSE 
TO PROHIBIT THE HOUSING

[Captioner] 21:30:02
 
PROVIDERS TO CATCH UP WITH THE 
INFLATION

[Captioner] 21:30:07
?
REGARDING THE

[Captioner] 21:30:11
 CRIMINAL CHECKUP

[Captioner] 21:30:14
, 
THE

[Captioner] 21:30:17
 CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECK

[Captioner] 21:30:20
 
SIGNIFICANTLY COMPROMISES THE 
SAFETY OF OUR COMMUNITY OF THE 


[Captioner] 21:30:23
SAFETY OF OTHER TENANTS IN THE 
APARTMENTS AS WELL AS TO THE 
SAFETY OF

[Captioner] 21:30:27
 HOUSING PROVIDERS.


[Captioner] 21:30:31
THE RENT

[Captioner] 21:30:34
 IS A MATTER OF SUPPLY 
AND DEMAND.

[Captioner] 21:30:37

MORE RESTRICTIONS OF THE 
GOVERNMENT, MANY HOUSING 


[Captioner] 21:30:40
PROVIDERS WILL BE FORCED OUT OF 
THE MARKET

[Captioner] 21:30:44
 AND BE

[Captioner] 21:30:49
 CRAZE THE 
HOUSING SUPPLIES.
WITH THE

[Captioner] 21:30:52
 DECREASE OF THE HOUSING 
SUPPLY WHAT IS GOING TO

[Captioner] 21:30:55
 HAPPEN 
WITH THE RENTAL AMOUNT?
YOU ARE TRYING TO INCREASE THE

[Captioner] 21:30:58
 
AFFORDABILITY BUT YOU ARE DOING 
EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE

[Captioner] 21:31:03
.
PLEASE STOP ALL THESE PROPOSALS

[Captioner] 21:31:06
.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 21:31:09
>> Alberto Quintanilla:   OUR 
NEXT SPEAKER IS SANDRA M.


[Captioner] 21:31:18
>> YES, THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING 
ME TO SPEAK TONIGHT

[Captioner] 21:31:20
.
I'LL KEEP THIS SHORT.
I'LL AGREE WITH ALL OF THE 


[Captioner] 21:31:24
POINTS BY LISA DANS.

[Captioner] 21:31:27

I'M ALSO A MEMBER OF THE 
TREATMENT FOR EVERYONE AND I'D

[Captioner] 21:31:30
 
LIKE TO POINT OUT SOME OTHER 
CONCERNS

[Captioner] 21:31:34
.
KEEPING IN MIND THAT THE 
PANDEMIC IS STILL A

[Captioner] 21:31:37
 MOVING 
TARGET.
KEEP IN

[Captioner] 21:31:40
 MIND THAT THE U.S. AND 
CALIFORNIA WAS NUMBER 1 IN THE

[Captioner] 21:31:42
 
WORLD, AND OFTEN TOP OF THAT 
ALAMEDA COUNTY.


[Captioner] 21:31:47
-- AND ON TOP OF THAT, ALAMEDA 
COUNTY.
WITH THE LIFTING

[Captioner] 21:31:51
 OF THE 
MORATORIUM, MANY LANDLORDS WILL 
BE CREATING

[Captioner] 21:31:54
 THE NEW HUNGER 
STRIKER.


[Captioner] 21:31:57
BY EVICTIONS.
THIS WILL INCLUDE WOMEN,

[Captioner] 21:32:00
 MEN, 
AND CHILDREN.


[Captioner] 21:32:04
I SUGGEST THAT WE TAKE A LOOK AT 
WHAT

[Captioner] 21:32:07
 -- REVISIT WHAT

[Captioner] 21:32:10
 ALSO

[Captioner] 21:32:14
 
SHENFIL HAS PRESENTED TO US,

[Captioner] 21:32:18
 THE 
PERCENTAGE OF THE ERA

[Captioner] 21:32:21
P 
RECIPIENTS THAT HAVE AND COULD 
TELL THEIR STORIES OF

[Captioner] 21:32:24
 
HARASSMENTS BY THEIR LANDLORDS, 
MANY WERE HARASS

[Captioner] 21:32:28
ED TO THE POINT 
THAT THEY ACTUALLY LEFT

[Captioner] 21:32:31
, AND 
WENT TO LIVE IN THEIR CAR.


[Captioner] 21:32:34
MIGHT WANT TO CHECK WITH YOUR 
HUMAN RESOURCES DEPARTMENT ON

[Captioner] 21:32:38
 
THAT FINANCE MANY WERE AFFECTED

[Captioner] 21:32:42
.
I SUGGEST THAT WITHIN THE

[Captioner] 21:32:45
 
16,500,000 WHICH WAS ISSUED,

[Captioner] 21:32:49
 
THAT'S 3 MILLION WAS

[Captioner] 21:32:52
 PAID OUT 
FOR 30% AND UNDER FOR A VERY

[Captioner] 21:32:56
 LOW 
INCOME PEOPLE.

[Captioner] 21:33:00

THIS SEEMS TO BE AN UNEQUAL 
AMOUNT.


[Captioner] 21:33:03
I WOULD CERTAINLY LIKE TO SEE 
SOME FURTHER FIGURES ON

[Captioner] 21:33:07
 THAT.
THANK YOU

[Captioner] 21:33:11
 COUNCIL SALWAN FOR 
ASKING THE CORRECT INFORMATION.
I SUGGEST

[Captioner] 21:33:14
 AND WISH FOR YOU TO 
MOVE VERY SWIFTLY

[Captioner] 21:33:19
, PRESST

[Captioner] 21:33:22
O 
CONMOTO ON THIS TOPIC

[Captioner] 21:33:26
.
>> Alberto Quintanilla:   OUR 
NEXT SPEAKER IS DAN.

[Captioner] 21:33:29

>> COVID-19 IS A VERY SCARY 
VIRUS.

[Captioner] 21:33:32

PANDEMIC HAS CAUSED A LOT OF 
DAMAGE TO AMERICANS INCLUDING ME

[Captioner] 21:33:35
 
AND YOU.
BUT NOTHING'S MORE SCARY

[Captioner] 21:33:38
 OR 
CAUSING MORE DAMAGE THAN THE

[Captioner] 21:33:42
 
SEVERE POLICY AGAINST THE 
HOUSING PROVIDERS.

[Captioner] 21:33:45

ESPECIALLY ALAMEDA COUNTY.
MY NAME IS DAN, HOUSING

[Captioner] 21:33:48
 PROVIDER 
IN FREMONT AND A BOARD MEMBER OF 
D

[Captioner] 21:33:51
HN.
EVICTION MORATORIUM HAS CAUSED 
TAKE

[Captioner] 21:33:55
 AWAY HOUSING PROVIDERS 
RIGHTS TO CONNECT RENT FOR

[Captioner] 21:33:58
 
ALMOST THREE YEARS.
NO MATTER

[Captioner] 21:34:01
 HOUSING PROVIDERS WERE 
STILL NEED TO PAY PROPERTY TAX

[Captioner] 21:34:04
, 
UTILITY BILLS, REPAIR, 
ET CETERA.


[Captioner] 21:34:07
NOW FREMONT CITY IS TRYING TO 
TAKE MORE RIGHTS

[Captioner] 21:34:10
 FROM HOUSING 
PROVIDERS.

[Captioner] 21:34:14

FAIL CHANCE.
WHO GAVE

[Captioner] 21:34:17
 HOUSING PROVIDER 
FAIRNESS.
WHEN THE GOVERNMENT HELD

[Captioner] 21:34:20
 
EMPLOYEES THEY NEED TO DO 
CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECKS.

[Captioner] 21:34:23

WHY NOT HOUSING PROVIDERS?
ONLY BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE

[Captioner] 21:34:25
 
POWER?
WE FULLY UNDERSTAND HOUSING 


[Captioner] 21:34:29
PROVIDERS NEEDS TO GIVE FAIR 
CHANCE TO EVERYONE.
BUT WHO GAVE

[Captioner] 21:34:32
 THE FAIRNESS TO 
HOUSING PROVIDERS?
ALSO, THIS

[Captioner] 21:34:36
 POLICY WILL ENCOURAGE 
PEOPLE TO BE CRIMINALS BECAUSE 
THERE IS

[Captioner] 21:34:39
 NO CONSEQUENCE FOR 
THEIR BEHAVIOR

[Captioner] 21:34:42
.
LAW IN CALIFORNIA ARE FAVORING 
CRIMINALS ALREADY

[Captioner] 21:34:45
.
A LOT OF FAMILY HAS

[Captioner] 21:34:49
 BECOME 
MISCONDUCT.
THAT IS WHY CALIFORNIA HAS

[Captioner] 21:34:52
 
BECOME MORE AND MORE DANGEROUS.
HOW MANY SUSTAINING ROBBERY

[Captioner] 21:34:55
 ARE 
HAPPENING RIGHT NOW EVERY DAY IN 
CALIFORNIA.


[Captioner] 21:34:58
I GOT A COMPLAINT ALMOST EVERY 
DAY ABOUT BROKEN CARS

[Captioner] 21:35:01
.
BROKEN DOORS,

[Captioner] 21:35:04
 STEALING IN 
FREMONT.
HOW MANY MORE DO YOU WANT?


[Captioner] 21:35:07
HOW MANY MORE DAMAGE YOU WANT TO 
CAUSE TO

[Captioner] 21:35:10
 BEAUTIFUL CITY OF 
FREMONT?
AS I HEARD, THAT'S BEEN NO 


[Captioner] 21:35:14
COMPLAINT FROM TENANTS ABOUT 
DISCRIMINATION DUE TO CRIMINAL 
BACKGROUND CHECK

[Captioner] 21:35:17
.
MY QUESTION IS, IF THERE IS NO 
COMPLAINT

[Captioner] 21:35:21
, OUR COUNCILMEMBER HAS 
NOTHING TO DO,

[Captioner] 21:35:24
 OR COUNCILMEMBER 
HAS -- DON'T REALLY WANT TO

[Captioner] 21:35:27
 STOP 
THE REAL PROBLEM, SO

[Captioner] 21:35:30
 --
>> Alberto Quintanilla:   OUR 
NEXT SPEAKER IS CHRIS MOORE.


[Captioner] 21:35:38
>> HELLO, COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN 
SAID A LOT

[Captioner] 21:35:41
 OF PEOPLE ARE FACING 
EVICTION.
REALLY

[Captioner] 21:35:45
?
NO ONE, AND I'LL SAY THIS TO

[Captioner] 21:35:48
 ALL 
THE COUNCILMEMBERS THERE, NO ONE 
CAN BE EVICTED

[Captioner] 21:35:51
 FOR NOT PAYING 
RENT FOR THE LAST 36 MONTHS

[Captioner] 21:35:55
.
AND IN FACT TWO MORE MONTHS 
UNTIL APRIL 29th

[Captioner] 21:35:58
.
THEY CANNOT BE EVICTED FOR NOT 
PAYING THAT RENT.

[Captioner] 21:36:01

HOW ARE THEY FACING EVICTION?
HAVE THEY NOT SAVED

[Captioner] 21:36:04
 ANY MONEY IN 
THE LAST 36 MONTHS

[Captioner] 21:36:08
?
MR. T

[Captioner] 21:36:11
WA SAID EARLIER, LOOK AT 
THE DATA.


[Captioner] 21:36:14
THE DATA SAID, EVICTIONS ARE NOT 
HAPPENING.
DON'T BELIEVE

[Captioner] 21:36:18
 THE SCARE TACTICS.
HONESTLY IT SOUNDS LIKE

[Captioner] 21:36:21
 YOU'RE 
LISTENING TO AACE ACTION AND

[Captioner] 21:36:26
 
THEIR DIRECTOR LIEG LAYA

[Captioner] 21:36:30
.
PROFITEER FROM MORE OPERATIONS, 
THEY

[Captioner] 21:36:33
 LOVE RENTAL REGULATIONS, 
BECAUSE THEN THE CITY GIVES THEM 
FUNDS

[Captioner] 21:36:37
.
AND GRANTS.
AND THAT'S WHAT'S GOING

[Captioner] 21:36:40
 ON UP IN 
BERKELEY AND OAKLAND AND

[Captioner] 21:36:42
 SAN 
LEANDRO AND ALL THESE OTHER 
CITIES.


[Captioner] 21:36:45
THEY PROVIDE MORE SCARE TACTICS, 
THEY GET MORE MONEY.

[Captioner] 21:36:48

THESE ORGANIZATIONS ARE SAYING 
ON THEIR WEBSITES, FREE

[Captioner] 21:36:51
 RENT 
FOREVER.
EVICT -- NO EVICTION

[Captioner] 21:36:55
S FOREVER.
WHY WOULD YOU EVEN LISTEN TO 
THEM?


[Captioner] 21:36:58
ALSO MENTIONED IS THAT YOU WANT 
TO WASTE STAFF TIME IN LOOK

[Captioner] 21:37:01
ING 
FOR RENT REGULATIONS IN OTHER 
CITIES.


[Captioner] 21:37:04
LOOK AT BERKELEY, LOOK AT 
OAKLAND, LOOK AT

[Captioner] 21:37:07
 SAN FRANCISCO, 
THEY HAVE THE STRONG

[Captioner] 21:37:10
EST RENT 
RESTRICTIONS IN THE COUNTRY, 
WHAT

[Captioner] 21:37:13
 DO THEY GET?
THE STRONG

[Captioner] 21:37:16
EST HOMELESSNESS IN 
THE COUNTRY.

[Captioner] 21:37:20

FREMONT WANTS THAT?
NO COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN

[Captioner] 21:37:23
.
YOUR VOTERS DON'T WANT THAT.
IT IS

[Captioner] 21:37:26
 THE ADVOCATES THAT ARE 
PROFITEER

[Captioner] 21:37:29
ING THAT ARE THE ONLY 
ONES CALLING IN.
LASTLY ON FAIR CHANCE

NEXT SPEAKER IS KATHERINE

[Captioner] 21:37:53

I AM KATHERINE RUBY.
I AM A MEMBER

[Captioner] 21:37:57
 OF AND LEADER OF 
FREMONT FOR EVERYONE.


[Captioner] 21:38:01
I'M SPEAKING IN FAVOR OF THIS 
AGENDA

[Captioner] 21:38:04
 ITEM THAT HAS BEEN 
REFERRED

[Captioner] 21:38:08
 BY COUNCILMEMBER 
KASSAN.
AND I

[Captioner] 21:38:11
 FEEL THAT THIS

[Captioner] 21:38:15
 DEBATE HAS 
BECOME BLOWN OUT OF PROPORTION 
IN

[Captioner] 21:38:18
 MANY WAYS.
YES.
SOME PEOPLE

[Captioner] 21:38:21
 ARE AT RISK OF BEING 
EVICTED.


[Captioner] 21:38:24
AND YES, THAT'S LESS THAN TWO 
MONTHS AWAY

[Captioner] 21:38:28
.
AND YES.
SOME PEOPLE WASTED THEIR TIME

[Captioner] 21:38:31
.
BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN THAT 
EVERYONE

[Captioner] 21:38:34
 DID.
OR THAT EVERYONE IS AT RISK

[Captioner] 21:38:38
.
BUT WHEN THERE ARE PEOPLE AT 
RISK WHO

[Captioner] 21:38:41
 HAVE LEGITIMATELY TRIED 
TO MAKE ENDS

[Captioner] 21:38:45
 MEET, AND HAVE 
LEGITIMATELY

[Captioner] 21:38:48
 TRIED TO APPLY FOR 
THE EXTRA

[Captioner] 21:38:51
 FUNDING AVAILABLE 
THROUGH COVID RELIEF, AND

[Captioner] 21:38:54
 STILL 
HAVE FALLEN BEHIND, I

[Captioner] 21:38:58
 FEEL LIKE 
IT IS STILL

[Captioner] 21:39:02
 FREMONT 
COUNCILMEMBERS' RESPONSIBILITY 
TO LOOK INTO

[Captioner] 21:39:06
 THAT SITUATION AND 
MAKE SURE THAT THESE PEOPLE

[Captioner] 21:39:09
 ARE 
TREATED FAIRLY AND WITH RESPECT

[Captioner] 21:39:12
, 
AND NOT JUST TOSSED

[Captioner] 21:39:15
 OUT ON THE 
STREET.
BECAUSE WE ARE TALKING

[Captioner] 21:39:19
 ABOUT NOT 
JUST MEN

[Captioner] 21:39:22
 AND WOMEN.
BUT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT 
CHILDREN AS

[Captioner] 21:39:25
 WELL, YOU KNOW, AND 
WHEN PEOPLE GET TOSSED

[Captioner] 21:39:28
 OUT, 
CHILDREN GET TAKEN AWAY.
AND YOU'RE BREAK

[Captioner] 21:39:31
ING DOWN FAMILY 
AT THAT POINT.
AND WHAT HAPPENED TO

[Captioner] 21:39:34
 FAMILY 
VALUES?
WHAT HAPPENED TO KEEPING FAMILY 


[Captioner] 21:39:37
MEMBERS TOGETHER?
WHAT HAPPENED TO

[Captioner] 21:39:40
 KEEPING OUR 
SUPPORT SYSTEMS TOGETHER?
BECAUSE

[Captioner] 21:39:44
 I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING:  
I'VE

[Captioner] 21:39:47
 ALREADY DISCOVERED THROUGH 
MY OWN HOMELESSNESS

[Captioner] 21:39:51
 THAT 
SHELTERS DO NOT SUPPORT --
>> Alberto Quintanilla:   NEXT 


[Captioner] 21:39:54
SPEAKER IS SHERMAN.


[Captioner] 21:39:58
>> HI, SHERMAN MOSS, SMALL 
LANDLORD

[Captioner] 21:40:01
 FOR TOWN HOUSE NEW 
FREMONT.
AS A MINORITY BELONG

[Captioner] 21:40:04
 TO PEOPLE 
OF COLOR, I HAVE DEEP CONCERN 
ABOUT

[Captioner] 21:40:08
 THE POTENTIAL NEGATIVE 
IMPACT OF

[Captioner] 21:40:11
 THIS PROPOSAL ON OUR 
COMMUNITY

[Captioner] 21:40:15
.
I UNDERSTAND THE INTENTION 
BEHIND THE

[Captioner] 21:40:18
 PROPOSAL IS TO 
PROTECT THE TENANTS, I DO NOT 
BELIEVE THEY

[Captioner] 21:40:21
 ARE NECESSARY.
WE ALREADY HAVE ESTABLISHED THE 
LAWS

[Captioner] 21:40:24
 THAT PROTECT THE BOTH 
TENANTS AND THE LANDLORDS.
AND IT IS

[Captioner] 21:40:28
 MY BELIEF THAT THIS 
PROPOSAL WOULD ONLY SERVE TO

[Captioner] 21:40:31
 
CREATE MORE UNNECESSARY 
BUREAUCRACY

[Captioner] 21:40:35
.
FURTHERMORE, I WOULD LIKE TO 
DRAW YOUR ATTENTION

[Captioner] 21:40:38
 TO THE FACT 
THAT CALIFORNIA ALREADY HAS SOME 
OF THE

[Captioner] 21:40:42
 MOST RESTRICTIVE EVICTION 
MORATORIUM IN PLACE.


[Captioner] 21:40:45
THIS PROPOSAL IN MY VIEW IS

[Captioner] 21:40:48
 JUST 
ANOTHER FORM OF MORATORIUM.
THAT WOULD

[Captioner] 21:40:52
 MAKE IT VERY 
DIFFICULT TO EVICT THOSE

[Captioner] 21:40:55
 WHO 
VIOLATE THE TERMS OF THEIR LEASE 
AGREEMENTS

[Captioner] 21:40:59
.
AS A CONCERNED MEMBER OF THE 
COMMUNITY, I URGE

[Captioner] 21:41:05
 ALL CITY 
COUNCIL MEMBERS TO DO THE RIGHT 
THING AND REJECT

[Captioner] 21:41:09
 THE 
UNREASONABLE PROPOSAL.
WE NOTICED TO WORK TOGETHER

[Captioner] 21:41:12
 TO 
FIND SOLUTIONS THAT BENEFIT BOTH 
TENANTS AND

[Captioner] 21:41:15
 LANDLORDS.
WITHOUT PLACING UNDUE BURDEN ON

[Captioner] 21:41:19
 
ONE GROUP AT THE EXPENSE OF THE 
OTHER.

[Captioner] 21:41:20

THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND 
ATTENTION.

 ALL FOR DOING 
GREAT SERVICES

[Captioner] 21:41:42
 AND MAKING OUR 
CITY GREAT.
WE

[Captioner] 21:41:46
 SHOULD ALLOW ABSOLUTELY TO DO

[Captioner] 21:41:49
 
THE CRIMINAL CHECKS

[Captioner] 21:41:53
 AND ALLOW 
OWNERS TO DO HAVE

[Captioner] 21:41:56
 THE 
UNDERSTANDING OF THE RENTERS.
AND I

[Captioner] 21:41:59
 DON'T WANT MY FAMILY

[Captioner] 21:42:03
 TO BE 
RISKED OR YOUR FAMILY TO BE 
RISKED

[Captioner] 21:42:06
.
WE SHOULD NOT

[Captioner] 21:42:10
 BE ANY MORE

[Captioner] 21:42:13
 
EVICTIONS FOR RENTERS OR

[Captioner] 21:42:16
 MAKE 
ANY HARDER FOR LANDLORDS

[Captioner] 21:42:19
 AND 
MAKE ALREADY UNFAIR

[Captioner] 21:42:23
 RENTAL 
STATE.
ALLOW THE PEOPLE

[Captioner] 21:42:26
 WHO CANNOT 
AFFORD THE HOUSING.
YOU

[Captioner] 21:42:30
 SHOULD HELP FOR THE PAYMENTS 
FOR THE RENDERS

[Captioner] 21:42:33
 RENDERS WHO CANNOT PAY.
OUR CITY SHOULD PROVIDE

[Captioner] 21:42:36
 BETTER 
FACILITIES AND YOU SHOULD FOCUS 
ON THOSE KIND OF THINGS

[Captioner] 21:42:39
 RATHER 
THAN ALL UNNECESSARY THINGS.
YOU

[Captioner] 21:42:42
 SHOULD PROVIDE FACILITIES TO 
THE PARK, ADD

[Captioner] 21:42:46
 MORE TENNIS 
COURTS, BADLY NEEDED, ADD

[Captioner] 21:42:49
 MORE 
EXERCISE FACILITIES IN PARK, AND 
THAT SHOULD BE

[Captioner] 21:42:52
 YOUR FOCUS.
NOT MAKING

[Captioner] 21:42:56
 CITY 
CRIMINAL-FRIENDLY.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 21:43:02
>> Alberto Quintanilla:   NEXT 
SPEAKER IS SYMON.


[Captioner] 21:43:09
>> HELLO.
MAYOR, DEAR MAYOR

[Captioner] 21:43:13
 AND CITY 
COUNCIL MEMBERS.
I

[Captioner] 21:43:16
 AM A LONG TIME RESIDENT

[Captioner] 21:43:19
 AT THE 
FREMONT CITY.
HERE I WANT TO

[Captioner] 21:43:23
 PRESENT MY

[Captioner] 21:43:26
 VIEW 
OF THE PROPOSAL

[Captioner] 21:43:30
 ABOUT THE

[Captioner] 21:43:33
 NEW 
EXTRA RENTAL REGULATION

[Captioner] 21:43:36
 ON 
FREMONT AREA.
I

[Captioner] 21:43:41
 HAVE STRONG OBJECTION ON IT 
BECAUSE CALIFORNIA HAS A

[Captioner] 21:43:45
 VERY 
STRONG COMPREHENSIVE RENTER

[Captioner] 21:43:48
 
PROTECTION LAW.
I

[Captioner] 21:43:52
 THINK THAT IT'S -- AND THE

[Captioner] 21:43:55
 
STATE ALSO LAW HAS PROTECTED THE 
RENT

[Captioner] 21:43:59
ER PRETTY WELL.
I DON'T THINK FREMONT NEED

[Captioner] 21:44:04
 EXTRA 
RESEARCH

[Captioner] 21:44:07
, EXTRA WORK ON IT.
ALSO WE SEE

[Captioner] 21:44:10
 OTHER CITIES SUCH AS 
OAKLAND AND SAN FRANCISCO

[Captioner] 21:44:13
, THEY 
HAVE EXTRA WORK BUT

[Captioner] 21:44:16
 IT DIDN'T 
SOLVE ANYTHING.
EVEN MAKE

[Captioner] 21:44:21
 THE RENTING SITUATION 
WORSE.


[Captioner] 21:44:27
AND I THINK THE BACKGROUND 
CHECKING

[Captioner] 21:44:31
 SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED.

[Captioner] 21:44:34

BECAUSE THIS BACKGROUND CHECKING

[Captioner] 21:44:38
 
ACTUALLY ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO 
BEHAVE

[Captioner] 21:44:41
 MOCIALLY, LEGAL, FOLLOW 
THE LAW.
IF WE

[Captioner] 21:44:44
 GIVE UP THIS SYSTEM 
BACKGROUND CHECKING SYSTEM

[Captioner] 21:44:47
, THAT 
WILL ON THE OTHER HAND ENCOURAGE

[Captioner] 21:44:51
 
THE PEOPLE NOT TO

[Captioner] 21:44:54
 BEHAVE 
RESPONSIBLY.
IN ORDER

[Captioner] 21:44:57
 TO SOLVE THIS

[Captioner] 21:45:02
 
UNEMPLOYMENT PROBLEM AND RENTER

[Captioner] 21:45:05
 
PROBLEM, EVICTION PROBLEM, I

[Captioner] 21:45:08
 
THINK THE CITY COUNCIL

[Captioner] 21:45:11
 SHOULD.
>> Alberto Quintanilla:   OUR 
NEXT SPIEKER IS MI

[Captioner] 21:45:14
NA YOUNG.


[Captioner] 21:45:26
>> MY UH HI I'M MINA YOUNG

[Captioner] 21:45:29
, A 
MEMBER OF BON AND SINGLE

[Captioner] 21:45:33
 FAMILY 
HOMEOWNER.
I THINK FREMONT SHOULD BE AN 


[Captioner] 21:45:36
EXAMPLE FOR A LOT OF THE BAY 
AREA CITIES BECAUSE YOU WILL

[Captioner] 21:45:40
 
HAVE SPACE ON DATA BASED ON THE 
COUNCIL'S REPORT

[Captioner] 21:45:43
.
REALLY THERE IS NO PROOF, NO 
DATA TO SHOW THAT YOU

[Captioner] 21:45:46
 HAVE THOSE 
PROBLEMS.
AND ACTUALLY,

[Captioner] 21:45:50
 THE REGULATIONS IN 
OTHER

[Captioner] 21:45:53
 AREAS ARE ADDING TO 
PROBLEMS THAT YOU DON'T

[Captioner] 21:45:56
 HAVE.
SO YOUR RENTAL REVIEW PROGRAM IS 
GREAT

[Captioner] 21:46:00
.

[Captioner] 21:46:07

YOU SHOULD NOT BE COPYING THINGS

[Captioner] 21:46:10
 
THAT ARE NOT WORKING, BAY AREA 
OTHER CITIES LIKE BERKELEY

[Captioner] 21:46:12
, SAN 
FRANCISCO, THEY'RE JUST MAKING 
THINGS WORSE.


[Captioner] 21:46:33
BY LIMITING YOUR CONTROL YOU ARE  
MAKING

[Captioner] 21:46:36
 IT UNCOMFORTABLE FOR THEM 
TO RENT OUT.

[Captioner] 21:46:40

LESS SUPPLY AND OWNERS WILL HAVE 
FEWER OPPORTUNITIES TO

[Captioner] 21:46:43
 SHARE 
COSTS SO IT'S NOT GOOD FOR 
EITHER SIDE SO PLEASE

[Captioner] 21:46:46
 DO NOT DO 
THOSE PROPOSALS IN 7.

[Captioner] 21:46:49
8.2.
THANK YOU.
>> Alberto Quintanilla:   OUR 


[Captioner] 21:46:53
FINAL SPEAKER IS DEREK BARNES.


[Captioner] 21:47:04
>> HELLO CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS 
AND MAYOR,

[Captioner] 21:47:07
 I'M DEREK BARNS, CEO

[Captioner] 21:47:11
 
OF EAST BAY HOUSING ASSOCIATION 
AROUND OUR ASSOCIATION

[Captioner] 21:47:14
 IS SMALL 
OWNER-OPERATORS

[Captioner] 21:47:17
 AND SMALL RENTAL 
PROPERTIES ACROSS ALAMEDA 
COUNTY.


[Captioner] 21:47:20
I THINK WHAT'S INTERESTING IS 
WHAT WE'VE

[Captioner] 21:47:24
 HEARD TONIGHT FROM 
MANY OWNERS OF RENTAL PROPERTIES

[Captioner] 21:47:28
 
THAT DO NOT

[Captioner] 21:47:31
, DO NOT GO DOWN THIS 
PATH MAKING

[Captioner] 21:47:34
 A THREE YEAR 
SITUATION WORSE.


[Captioner] 21:47:38
YOU'VE HEARD MANY SPEAKERS 
TONIGHT TALK ABOUT THE IMPACT

[Captioner] 21:47:40
 OF 
AN EVICTION MORATORIUM FOR THREE 
YEARS.


[Captioner] 21:47:49
THAT NEEDS TO BE, MANY PEOPLE IN 
THEIR BUSINESSES INCLUDING RENT

[Captioner] 21:47:52

RENTERS WRITE THEM NOT HAVING 
THE ABILITY

[Captioner] 21:47:56
 TO EVICT, THEM NOT 
HAVING THE ABILITY

[Captioner] 21:47:59
 TO

[Captioner] 21:48:04
 CONTROL 
THE HOUSING WITHIN YOUR AREA AND 
YOU DO NOT WANT

[Captioner] 21:48:07
 FREMONT TO 
FOLLOW MODELS OF BERKELEY AND

[Captioner] 21:48:10
 
OAKLAND, AND SAN FRANCISCO

[Captioner] 21:48:14
.

[Captioner] 21:48:27

INSTEAD LET'S FOCUS ON 
HOMELESSNESS

[Captioner] 21:48:31
, IF THAT CONTINUES 
TO BE A PROBLEM ACROSS THE BAY 
AREA THEN THE THING

[Captioner] 21:48:34
 THAT SOLVES 
THAT IS MORE HOUSING.
MAKING

[Captioner] 21:48:38
 UNITS AVAILABLE, THAT ARE 
ALREADY ON THE MARKET, AND 
BUILDING

[Captioner] 21:48:41
 MORE HOUSING.
SO THAT WE CAN ACCOMMODATE MORE 
PEOPLE

[Captioner] 21:48:44
 IN THE BAY AREA.
AND FINALLY FOR THOSE

[Captioner] 21:48:47
 HOUSEHOLDS 
THAT NEED ADDITIONAL ASSISTANCE 
IN TERMS OF INCOME

[Captioner] 21:48:51
, DEVELOP 
PROGRAMS THAT HELP CLOSE THE

[Captioner] 21:48:54
 GAP 
AND HELP PEOPLE STAY IN THEIR 
HOMES.


[Captioner] 21:48:58
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE 
OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TONIGHT.


[Captioner] 21:49:09
>> Mayor Mei:   ACTUALLY WE 
ALREADY CALLED ALL THE SPEAKERS 
IN THE ROOM, THAT'S

[Captioner] 21:49:12
 WHY WE 
WANTED TO BE FAIR.
MY APOLOGIES,

[Captioner] 21:49:16
 I STILL WANT TO 
GENETIC BACK TO COUNCIL FOR THE 
CONVERSATION

[Captioner] 21:49:18
 TO ENSURE -- WE 
HAVE TWO AGENDA ITEMS FOLLOWING 
THIS TOO THIS

[Captioner] 21:49:21
 EVENING.
SO I'LL BEGIN WITH COUNCILMEMBER 
KENG

[Captioner] 21:49:24
 OR VICE MAYOR KENG I THINK 
YOU HAD YOUR BUTTON

[Captioner] 21:49:27
 UP FIRST.
>> Vice Mayor Keng:   THANK YOU 
MADAM MAYOR.


[Captioner] 21:49:31
SO I WANT TO SHARE

[Captioner] 21:49:34
 MY 
APPRECIATION OF COUNCILMEMBER 
KASSAN BRINGING UP THIS REFERRAL 


[Captioner] 21:49:37
ITEM TO HAVE THIS DISCUSSION AND 
HEAR THE

[Captioner] 21:49:41
 STAFF RECOMMENDATIONS 
AND UPDATE

[Captioner] 21:49:44
 ON RESOURCES FOR RENT

[Captioner] 21:49:47

RENTERS WHO MAY BE HAVING ISSUES

[Captioner] 21:49:51

ISSUES.
BUT MY SENTIMENT ON

[Captioner] 21:49:54
 EVICTION 
MORATORIUM AND EXTENDING IT, 
EVICTION

[Captioner] 21:49:57
 MORATORIUM WAS 
IMPORTANT AND ESSENTIAL AT THE 
BEGINNING OF THE

[Captioner] 21:50:00
 PANDEMIC.
ESPECIALLY

[Captioner] 21:50:04
 DURING SHELTER IN 
PLACE BECAUSE MANY RESIDENTS IN 
FREMONT AND AROUND THE COUNTRY

[Captioner] 21:50:07
 
WERE NOT ABLE TO GO TO WORK AND 
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, THEIR

[Captioner] 21:50:10
 PLACE 
OF EMPLOYMENT WAS SHUT DOWN OR 
THE NEEDS

[Captioner] 21:50:13
 OF PROVIDING CHILDCARE 
FOR THEIR KIDS, LEARNING

[Captioner] 21:50:16
 AT HOME 
OR HEALTH ISSUES.
BUT

[Captioner] 21:50:19
 NOW, AFTER THREE YEARS

[Captioner] 21:50:24
, IF 
WE ARE TO CONSIDER SENDING THE 
EVICTION

[Captioner] 21:50:27
 --
>> Councilmember Kassan:   
THAT'S NOT MY REFERRAL.


[Captioner] 21:50:30
I HATE TO INTERRUPT BUT THAT'S 
NOT MY REFERRAL.

[Captioner] 21:50:33

I'M NOT PROPOSING TO EXTEND THE

[Captioner] 21:50:36
 
EVICTION MORATORIUM.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 21:50:39
>> Vice Mayor Keng:   SO MY 
STAND FOR EVICTION MORATORIUM IS 
IT WOULD NOT

[Captioner] 21:50:42
 BE FAIR TO ADD THE 
BURDEN TO THE LANDLORDS AS

[Captioner] 21:50:45
 IF 
WE'RE ASKING THEM TO PROVIDE 
FREE SERVICE TO THEIR CUSTOMERS

[Captioner] 21:50:50
.
BUT ON BACKGROUND,

[Captioner] 21:50:53
 CRIMINAL 
BACKGROUND CHECKS

[Captioner] 21:50:56
, IF THE RENT 
REVIEW ORDINANCE

[Captioner] 21:50:59
 REQUIREMENT IS 
CURRENTLY LAW ABIDING BY

[Captioner] 21:51:02
 
ALLOWING THE LANDLORDS TO 
CONDUCT

[Captioner] 21:51:06
 SUCH BACKGROUND CHECKS, 
I THINK

[Captioner] 21:51:10
 AS WELL AS EMPLOYERS 
HAVE THE RIGHTS TO, YOU KNOW, 
SCREEN

[Captioner] 21:51:13
 THEIR TENANTS, OR 
POTENTIAL EMPLOYEES

[Captioner] 21:51:16
, I THINK 
THAT, YOU KNOW,

[Captioner] 21:51:20
 MOST LANDLORDS 
LOOKING AT THE QUALIFICATIONS OF 
THEIR POTENTIAL TENANTS

[Captioner] 21:51:23
 IS THE 
PERSON'S ABILITY TO PAY RENT

[Captioner] 21:51:26
, 
SUCH AS EMPLOYMENT

[Captioner] 21:51:29
,.
>> Councilmember Kassan:   I 
FEEL LIKE I HAVE TO

[Captioner] 21:51:33
 INTERRUPT 
BECAUSE WE COULD BE HERE ALL 
NIGHT AND THAT'S JUST NOT

[Captioner] 21:51:36
 MY 
REFERRAL.
MY REFERRAL IS NOT TO STOP 


[Captioner] 21:51:39
CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECKS SO I 
JUST HOPE THAT WE COULD

[Captioner] 21:51:42
 MAYBE 
RESPOND TO THE REFERRAL AND GET

[Captioner] 21:51:45
 
THIS ITEM OVER WITH BECAUSE WE 
HAVE TWO MORE ITEMS.

[Captioner] 21:51:49

IF EVERYONE SPEAKS TO CRIMINAL 
BACKGROUND

[Captioner] 21:51:52
 CHECKS WE WILL BE 
HERE ALL NIGHT AND THAT WAS NOT 
MY

[Captioner] 21:51:55
 REFERRAL.
>> Mayor Mei:   CONSUME, 
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN

[Captioner] 21:51:58
, I HOPE 
THAT EACH COUNCILMEMBER

[Captioner] 21:52:02
 WILL GET 
TO EXPRESS THEIR

[Captioner] 21:52:07
 COMMENTS.


[Captioner] 21:52:10
>> Vice Mayor Keng:   I'M JUST 
ABOUT DONE.
I THINK CURRENT RENT

[Captioner] 21:52:16
 IS DOING 
ITS JOB.
LOOKING AT

[Captioner] 21:52:20
 TENANTS EMPLOYMENT, 
IF WE ARE -- THE LANDLORDS HAVE 
THE RIGHT TO

[Captioner] 21:52:23
 LOOK AT THE -- ANY, 
YOU KNOW, CONDUCT BACKGROUND

[Captioner] 21:52:26
 
CHECKS.
BUT I BELIEVE, YOU KNOW, WE ARE 


[Captioner] 21:52:30
GOING TO LOOKING AT EACH CASE 
INDIVIDUALLY IF

[Captioner] 21:52:33
 THEY DID HAVE 
CRIMINAL HISTORY AND WHETHER 
IT'S BEEN A WHILE

[Captioner] 21:52:37
 OR, YOU KNOW, 
WHETHER THEY DO HAVE EMPLOYMENT 
CURRENTLY.


[Captioner] 21:52:40
I THINK THE LANDLORDS

[Captioner] 21:52:43
 WOULD TAKE 
ALL INTO CONSIDERATION AND

[Captioner] 21:52:46
 
HOPEFULLY BRING -- WE CAN BRING

[Captioner] 21:52:49
 
THOSE -- ANY POTENTIAL 
DISCRIMINATION INTO THE

[Captioner] 21:52:52
 RENT 
REVIEW BOARD TO SHARE ANY OF 
THOSE CONCERNS.


[Captioner] 21:52:58
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.
NEXT IS COUNCILMEMBER COX

[Captioner] 21:53:03
.
>> Councilmember Cox:  

[Captioner] 21:53:06
 THANK 
YOU.
I REALLY APPRECIATE ALL THE 


[Captioner] 21:53:10
COMMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN SHARED 
WITH --

[Captioner] 21:53:13
 TONIGHT AND I APPRECIATE

[Captioner] 21:53:17
 
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN PUTTING 
FORTH THIS EFFORT OF LOOKING

[Captioner] 21:53:21
 AT 
OTHER AREAS.
BUT I THINK AT THIS TIME, SOME

[Captioner] 21:53:24
 
OF THESE LAWS ARE NOT KICKING IN

[Captioner] 21:53:27
 
UNTIL JULY 1st OF 2023, TO 
KNOW THE

[Captioner] 21:53:30
 ASSESSMENT.
BUT ALSO, AT THE SAME TIME

[Captioner] 21:53:34
, I DO 
FEEL THAT THERE IS ENOUGH 
COVERAGE

[Captioner] 21:53:37
 FOR TENANT PROTECTION

[Captioner] 21:53:40
 
THAT WAS INTRODUCED BY ASSEMBLY 
MEMBER

[Captioner] 21:53:43
 DAVID CHEW FOR TENANT 
PROTECTION RIGHTS

[Captioner] 21:53:47
 THAT WOULD 
COVER EVERYONE UP TO THIS POINT

[Captioner] 21:53:50
.
AND I REALLY --

[Captioner] 21:53:53
 I DON'T SEE HOW 
TO CLOSE THE GAP ON WHAT WAS THE

[Captioner] 21:53:57
 
REFERRAL AND WHERE IT'S NOT 
BEING COVERED WHEN

[Captioner] 21:54:00
 -- IN 
DIFFERENT RULES THAT HAVE BEEN 
PUT

[Captioner] 21:54:03
 FORTH, THE LAWS SO FAR HAVE

[Captioner] 21:54:06
 
PROVIDED ENOUGH PROTECTION.
AND ALSO

[Captioner] 21:54:10
, THE END-DATE IS APRIL 
THE 29th

[Captioner] 21:54:13
, 2023.
AND WE'RE TALKING A LITTLE

[Captioner] 21:54:16
 
PREMATURE ABOUT A LOT OF THINGS 
TO HAPPEN

[Captioner] 21:54:20
.
AND I THINK WE'RE GOING TO NEED 
TO HAVE SOME GUIDANCE FROM

[Captioner] 21:54:23
 OUR 
COUNTY THAT INFLUENCES US FOR 
HOW THINGS HAPPEN

[Captioner] 21:54:26
 HERE IN THE 
CITY.
AND

[Captioner] 21:54:29
 AT THIS TIME I REALLY THINK 
THAT

[Captioner] 21:54:32
 THIS REFERRAL IS A LITTLE 
BIT OUT OF TIME

[Captioner] 21:54:36
.
IN TERMS OF IT'S NOT IN THE 
RIGHT PLACE OR THE

[Captioner] 21:54:39
 RIGHT TIME TO 
ASSESS ALL THE INFORMATION JUST 
YET.


[Captioner] 21:54:43
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.
NEXT IS

[Captioner] 21:54:46
 COUNCILMEMBER SHAO.
>> Councilmember Shao:   THANK 
YOU, MADAM MAYOR.

[Captioner] 21:54:49

I OPENLY

[Captioner] 21:54:52
 COMMENTED MANY TIMES 
THAT I CELEBRATE

[Captioner] 21:54:56
 THE SUNSET OF 
MORATORIUM IN

[Captioner] 21:54:59
 ALAMEDA COUNTY 
BECAUSE ALAMEDA COUNTY IS THE 
LAST COUNTY IN

[Captioner] 21:55:03
 CALIFORNIA THAT 
WOULD SUNSET

[Captioner] 21:55:06
 SUCH AN UNFAIR 
POLICY.


[Captioner] 21:55:09
I ALSO

[Captioner] 21:55:12
 APPRECIATE THE STAFF'S 
RESPONSE BY PROVIDING FACTION

[Captioner] 21:55:16
 FACTS AND 
DATA.
AS YOU KNOW I'M ALWAYS

[Captioner] 21:55:19
 LOOKING 
AT THE FACTS AND DATA AND I'M 
RELIEVED

[Captioner] 21:55:23
 TO SEE SO FAR OUR 
CURRENT PRACTICE,

[Captioner] 21:55:26
 OUR CURRENT 
SYSTEM IS WORKING.
ALSO,

[Captioner] 21:55:29
 I WELCOME ALL THE DATA 
PROVIDED BY THE

[Captioner] 21:55:32
 PUBLIC SPEAKERS, 
INCLUDING

[Captioner] 21:55:35
 DATA ON CURRENT 
EVICTION

[Captioner] 21:55:39
 RATE, DATA ON

[Captioner] 21:55:43
 PRACTICES 
OF OTHER CITIES AND COUNTIES

[Captioner] 21:55:46
.
I ALSO WOULD OFFER DATA THAT 
RIGHT

[Captioner] 21:55:49
 NOW, THE UNEMPLOYMENT

[Captioner] 21:55:53
 RATE 
IN THE ALAMEDA COUNTY IS 2.6%

[Captioner] 21:55:57
.
FREMONT MAYBE EVEN LOWER.


[Captioner] 21:56:01
I CELEBRATE THAT BECAUSE NOW 
SEEMS

[Captioner] 21:56:04
 LIKE EVERYONE CAN WORK

[Captioner] 21:56:08
 TO 
EARN MONEY TO TAKE FOR RENT IF 
NECESSARY.


[Captioner] 21:56:12
TO EARN A DECENT LIVING.


[Captioner] 21:56:15
IN SUMMARY, I DON'T SEE

[Captioner] 21:56:18
 THE 
CURRENT SYSTEM IS NOT WORKING.
SO

[Captioner] 21:56:21
 THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS 
PRESSING ISSUE

[Captioner] 21:56:24
 OR POTENTIAL 
PRESSING ISSUE ON THAT.


[Captioner] 21:56:27
WE HAVE EMPHASIZED A LOT THAT WE 
TRY

[Captioner] 21:56:31
 TO MINIMIZE REFERRALS, SO 
THAT OUR

[Captioner] 21:56:34
 STAFF CAN CONCENTRATE 
ON PRIORITIES SET BY

[Captioner] 21:56:38
 OUR ANNUAL 
RETREAT

[Captioner] 21:56:41
.
IF, AS SOME SPEAKERS SAID, THIS 
IS

[Captioner] 21:56:44
 REMOTELY RELATED TO HOMELESS 
ISSUES, THEN

[Captioner] 21:56:47
 WE ALREADY SET THE 
PRIORITY.
AND

[Captioner] 21:56:51
 STAFF DOESN'T NEED SUCH A 
REFERRAL TO THEN DO

[Captioner] 21:56:54
 ANY 
RESEARCH, IF THEY DEEM IT 
NECESSARY

[Captioner] 21:56:57
.
I'M ALSO

[Captioner] 21:57:00
 AMUSED OR EVEN CONFUSED 
BY THE

[Captioner] 21:57:03
 COMMENT THAT THE STAFF 
RECOMMENDED THIS

[Captioner] 21:57:07
 RESEARCH DURING 
THE BRIEFING.
I'VE BEEN

[Captioner] 21:57:10
 TO THE BRIEFINGS MANY 
TIMES AND I UNDERSTAND THE 
BRIEFINGS ARE

[Captioner] 21:57:13
 RESTRICTED TO 
INFORMATION EXCHANGE ONLY.


[Captioner] 21:57:17
THERE IS -- IT IS INAPPROPRIATE 
TO USE THE BRIEFING TO

[Captioner] 21:57:21
 DIRECT 
STAFF TO DO SOMETHING EXTRA

[Captioner] 21:57:24
 
WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF THE WHOLE

[Captioner] 21:57:28
 
COUNCIL.
LIKEWISE, THE STAFF CANNOT

[Captioner] 21:57:32
 JUST 
OFFER SUCH RECOMMENDATIONS 
INDIVIDUAL

[Captioner] 21:57:37
LY WITHOUT NOTIFYING 
THE

[Captioner] 21:57:41
 WHOLE COUNCIL.
SO I

[Captioner] 21:57:45
 WAS A LITTLE BIT OFFENDED 
BY THE WAY THIS

[Captioner] 21:57:48
 REFERRAL SOUNDS 
LIKE IT'S MORE LIKE

[Captioner] 21:57:52
 STAFF 
SELF-INVITED RESEARCH.
AND FOR

[Captioner] 21:57:55
 THAT, I CERTAINLY

[Captioner] 21:57:58
 DON'T 
AGREE THAT WE SHOULD DISTRACT 
OUR

[Captioner] 21:58:01
 STAFF, AND GO ON FOR SUCH A 
WILD GOOSE

[Captioner] 21:58:04
 CHASE.


[Captioner] 21:58:08
SO I AM NOT SUPPORTING THIS 
REFERRAL.


[Captioner] 21:58:13
>> Mayor Mei:   NEXT IS 
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN.


[Captioner] 21:58:18
>> Councilmember Kassan:   ALL 
RIGHT.
FIRST OF ALL, I DO WANT TO POINT 


[Captioner] 21:58:21
OUT, I HAVE A FEW THINGS I WANT 
TO SAY.
I

[Captioner] 21:58:25
 WANT TO POINT OUT THAT JUST 
BECAUSE YOU GET A JOB

[Captioner] 21:58:28
 DOESN'T 
MEAN YOU CANNOT AFFORD RENT.

[Captioner] 21:58:33

IT IS MANY, MANY PEOPLE WHO GET 
JOCKS AND CAN'T AFFORD

[Captioner] 21:58:36
 RENT, IT 
IS VERY COMMON.
THE CALIFORNIA RENTAL 


[Captioner] 21:58:39
ASSOCIATION IS ONE OF THE MOST 
POWERFUL LOBBYING GROUPS IN 
CALIFORNIA

[Captioner] 21:58:42
.
THEY HAVE A HUGE BUDGET TO HIRE 
STAFF

[Captioner] 21:58:46
 PAID LOBBYISTS, THEY CAME 
UP TO

[Captioner] 21:58:49
 OUR RETREAT AND CAME UP TO 
A COUNCILMEMBER AND SAID, WE 
SHOULD

[Captioner] 21:58:52
 HAVE A DRINK.
I FIND IT VERY OFFENSIVE THEY

[Captioner] 21:58:55
 
COME HERE ACTING LIKE THEY'RE 
ACTING IN THE INTEREST OF OUR 


[Captioner] 21:58:59
COMMUNITY WHEN THE MAJORITY OF 
LANDLORDS IN OUR

[Captioner] 21:59:02
 COUNTRY ARE 
GIANT MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS

[Captioner] 21:59:05
 
AND THAT'S WHO MOSTLY FUNDS THE 
CALIFORNIA

[Captioner] 21:59:08
 APARTMENT ASSOCIATION 
AND BY THE WAY IF THIS REFERRAL 
PASSES WE

[Captioner] 21:59:11
 CAN EASILY IF WE DO 
MAKE CHANGES TO OUR ORDINANCE,

[Captioner] 21:59:14
 
WE CAN EASILY EXEMPT SMALL 
LANDLORDS.

[Captioner] 21:59:18

WE COULD SAY, ANYTHING THAT WE 
DO

[Captioner] 21:59:21
 COULD ONLY APPLY TO LARGER 
LANDLORDS.
SO THERE'S ABSOLUTELY

[Captioner] 21:59:24
 NOTHING 
INHERENT IN THIS REFERRAL TO SAY

[Captioner] 21:59:28
 
THAT EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS HAS 
TO APPLY TO SOMEONE WHO JUST HAS

[Captioner] 21:59:31
 
ONE UNIT OR GOD FORBID IS 
RENTING

[Captioner] 21:59:36
 OUT ROOMS IN THEIR HOME.
SO THAT IS ABSOLUTELY NOT WHAT 
IS BEING

[Captioner] 21:59:39
 SUGGESTED TONIGHT.
THAT WOULD BE PART OF THE 
DISCUSSION IF THIS REFERRAL DOES 


[Captioner] 21:59:44
PASS.
YOU KNOW, IT'S NO SURPRISE THAT 
THIS ORGANIZATION THAT'S ONE OF 


[Captioner] 21:59:47
THE MOST WELL FUNDED LOBBYING 
GROUPS IN THE STATE IS

[Captioner] 21:59:50
 ABLE TO 
PULL TOGETHER PEOPLE TO COME TO 
THIS MEETING

[Captioner] 21:59:53
 TONIGHT.
WE DON'T --

[Captioner] 21:59:56
 TENANTS IN FREMONT 
ARE EXTREMELY BUSY, MANY OF THEM 
ARE

[Captioner] 22:00:00
 WORKING TWO OR THREE JOBS 
JUST TRYING TO MAKE ENDS

[Captioner] 22:00:03
 MEET SO 
IT'S NOT THAT SURPRISING THAT 
NOT MANY OF THEM WERE ABLE

[Captioner] 22:00:06
 TO 
SHOW UP TONIGHT.
BUT WE ARE ELECTED TO

[Captioner] 22:00:09
 REPRESENT 
EVERYONE WHO LIVES IN FREMONT 
NOT JUST THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ABLE 


[Captioner] 22:00:13
TO COME OUT AND SPEAK ON BEHALF 
OF LANDLORDS

[Captioner] 22:00:17
.
ALSO, I THINK IT SHOULD, 
SOMETHING SHOULD

[Captioner] 22:00:20
 HAVE BEEN SAID, 
I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE SOME

[Captioner] 22:00:23
 
BASIC RULES OF DECENCY IN THEIR 
MEETINGS

[Captioner] 22:00:26
.
I DO NOT APPRECIATE BEING CALLED 
BY A NAME THAT IS NOT

[Captioner] 22:00:29
 MY NAME SO 
PLEASE LET'S MAKE SURE THAT 
DOESN'T

[Captioner] 22:00:32
 HAPPEN AGAIN.
ALSO I DID WANT TO SAY THAT I 
DID NOT

[Captioner] 22:00:35
 DIRECT STAFF TO DO 
SOMETHING EXTRA IN THE STAFF 
BRIEFING

[Captioner] 22:00:39
 AS COUNCILMEMBER SHAO 
SEEMS TO THINK I DID.
I SIMPLY ASKED A

[Captioner] 22:00:42
 QUESTION ABOUT 
IDEAS OF THINGS THAT WERE COMING 
UP AND THAT

[Captioner] 22:00:45
 WAS ONE OF THE 
ANSWERS THAT CAME UP.
FINALLY, THE SUGGESTION

[Captioner] 22:00:48
 THAT 
FREMONT FOR EVERYONE OR ANY 
OTHER NONPROFIT

[Captioner] 22:00:51
 IS PROFITEERING 
OFF OF THIS

[Captioner] 22:00:54
 IS LAUGHABLE AND 
OFFENSIVE.
THEY ABSOLUTELY DO

[Captioner] 22:00:57
 NOT GET ANY 
FUNDING FROM ANYTHING THAT WE DO 
TO SUPPORT

[Captioner] 22:01:01
 TENANTS.
FREMONT FOR EVERYONE IS A 
COMPLETELY VOLUNTEER

[Captioner] 22:01:04
 
ORGANIZATION.
AND THE IDEA THAT PEOPLE WHO

[Captioner] 22:01:07
 ARE 
ADVOCATING ON BEHALF OF THE -- 
THOSE AMONG US WHO

[Captioner] 22:01:10
 CAN LEAST 
AFFORD BASIC LIVING ARE

[Captioner] 22:01:14
 SOMEHOW 
PROFITEERING IS

[Captioner] 22:01:17
 TRULY OFFENSIVE 
AND DISGUSTING, SO I WANTED TO

[Captioner] 22:01:20
 
MAKE SURE AND CLEAR UP THAT THAT 
IS ABSOLUTELY NOT THE CASE.


[Captioner] 22:01:23
THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei:   NEXT IS

[Captioner] 22:01:26
 
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN.


[Captioner] 22:01:34
>> Councilmember Salwan: THANK YOU,
MADAME MAYOR.
WE JUST HAD A RETREAT ABOUT A WEEK 

[Captioner] 22:01:36
AGO
WHERE WE DECIDED ON THE PRIORITIES OF
THE CITY COUNCIL.


[Captioner] 22:01:44
NOWHERE DID THE ISSUE OF RENT
PROTECTIONS COME UP BY

[Captioner] 22:01:47
 ANY
COUNCILMEMBER.
WE HAD LOTS OF

[Captioner] 22:01:50
 ITEMS THERE, AND WE
RANKED THE TOP THREE ISSUES THAT WE

[Captioner] 22:01:53
 WERE
CONCERNED ABOUT.
AND RENTAL ISSUES WAS

[Captioner] 22:01:56
 NOT ONE OF THEM.
WE ALSO HAD A

[Captioner] 22:01:59
 DISCUSSION ABOUT REFERRALS
IN

[Captioner] 22:02:04
 GENERAL TO TRY TO MINIMIZE THOSE

[Captioner] 22:02:07
 TO
BREAD AND BUTTER ISSUES ABOUT PUBLIC
SAFETY, POTHOLES,

[Captioner] 22:02:11
 HOMELESSNESS, THINGS
LIKE THAT.
AND SO I WAS A LITTLE SURPRISED TO

[Captioner] 22:02:14
 SEE
THIS REFERRAL THE FOLLOWING

[Captioner] 22:02:19
 WEEK SINCE
WE JUST HAD THIS ROBUST DISCUSSION ABOUT


[Captioner] 22:02:22
TRYING TO LIMIT TOO MANY REFERRALS WHICH
CREATE MORE WORK FOR THE STAFF AND

[Captioner] 22:02:25
 GET
IN THE WAY OF THE DAY TO DAY PROCESS.


[Captioner] 22:02:30
BASED ON WHAT I'VE HEARD SO FAR, IT
SOUNDS LIKE

[Captioner] 22:02:33
 THE CURRENT PROGRAM IS
WORKING

[Captioner] 22:02:36
 BASED ON THE TESTIMONY OF
MS. SHENFIL AND WAS IT -- I FORGOT

[Captioner] 22:02:37
 YOUR
NAME.
ROBERT.


[Captioner] 22:02:42
>> LOPEZ.
>> Councilmember Salwan: YES.
AND I WAS SURPRISED

[Captioner] 22:02:45
 THAT A LOT OF THEM
GET SETTLED AHEAD OF TIME, WHICH

[Captioner] 22:02:48
 IS
GOOD.
SO PROGRAM IS

[Captioner] 22:02:51
 WORKING AS FAR AS WE CAN
TELL, AND THERE'S NO ILL THAT NEEDS

[Captioner] 22:02:55

FIXING AS FAR AS WE CAN SEE.
THERE WAS MENTION OF

[Captioner] 22:02:58
 OTHER CITIES.
YOU KNOW, BERKELEY HAS A DIRECTLY

[Captioner] 22:03:00

ELECTED RENT CONTROL BOARD, AND IS ONE


[Captioner] 22:03:03
OF THE MOST CONTENTIOUS MEETINGS

[Captioner] 22:03:07
 AND NO
ONE IS HAPPY IN BERKELEY AS FAR AS

[Captioner] 22:03:10

TENANTS OR LAND

[Captioner] 22:03:14
LORDS AND THE RENTS
CERTAINLY ARE NOT COMING DOWN SO THAT'S


[Captioner] 22:03:17
DEFINITELY NOT THE WAY WE WANT TO DO
THINGS HERE IN FREMONT.
FREMONT IS

[Captioner] 22:03:21
 THE HAPPIEST CITY, AND
THE BEST WAY

[Captioner] 22:03:23
 TO KEEP THEM HAPPY IS
EVERYBODY WORK TOGETHER TO GIVE A LITTLE


[Captioner] 22:03:26
TO HELP THE COMMON GOOD SO THAT HELPS
EVERYONE.
WE'VE ALSO JUST

[Captioner] 22:03:30
 RECENTLY PASSED THESE IN
2019, AND THEN WE HAD THIS

[Captioner] 22:03:33
 PANDEMIC,
WHICH SHUT EVERYTHING DOWN, AND SO I
THINK WE HAVEN'T

[Captioner] 22:03:36
 REALLY HAD THE FULL
RAMIFICATIONS

[Captioner] 22:03:39
 OF THIS PROGRAM THAT WE'VE
INSTITUTED, AND SO

[Captioner] 22:03:42
 I THINK WE NEED TO
HAVE A NORMAL BASELINE YEAR

[Captioner] 22:03:46
 TO SEE HOW
DOES IT

[Captioner] 22:03:50
 WORK, WHAT ARE THE TWEAKS THAT
ARE NEEDED, GET MORE DATA AS

[Captioner] 22:03:51

COUNCILMEMBER SHAO MENTIONED, AND THEN


[Captioner] 22:03:54
WE CAN KIND OF DECIDE WHERE DO WE JUMP
IN AND

[Captioner] 22:03:58
 HELP WHERE THE HELP IS NEEDED?


[Captioner] 22:04:02
GOVERNOR NEWSOM SIGNED A MUCH STRICTER

[Captioner] 22:04:05

AB1482 BILL THAT HAS A LOT OF

[Captioner] 22:04:08

PROTECTIONS ALREADY, AND ALSO I HEAR

[Captioner] 22:04:11

SENATOR WOHABE IS ALSO WORKING ON A BILL


[Captioner] 22:04:14
AS WELL TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE.
WE HAVE SO MANY PRESSING ISSUES RIGHT

[Captioner] 22:04:18

NOW, AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT STAFF

[Captioner] 22:04:21

FOCUSES ON THE KEY ISSUES AFFECTING
FREMONT

[Captioner] 22:04:24
 RESIDENT.
OUR CURRENT RENT PROGRAM IS ALREADY

[Captioner] 22:04:26

COVERING A LOT OF THE ISSUES THAT ARE
RAISED.


[Captioner] 22:04:30
WE'RE LOOKING FOR A NEEDLE IN A
HAYSTACK.
I THINK WE NEED MORE

[Captioner] 22:04:33
 DATA.
THERE'S NO PROBLEM THAT I CAN SEE AT
THIS POINT THAT

[Captioner] 22:04:36
 NEEDS FIXING.
BUT MAYBE IN THE FUTURE, WE MAY SEE

[Captioner] 22:04:38

ISSUES THAT CROP UP AND WE SHOULD
ADDRESS THOSE.


[Captioner] 22:04:42
SO I WOULD ASK STAFF TO CONTINUE THE
GOOD WORK THEY'RE

[Captioner] 22:04:45
 DOING AND TO LOOK AT
AVAILABLE RESOURCES AND PROGRAM OPTIONS


[Captioner] 22:04:49
TO SUPPORT TENANTS, AND LANDLORDS AFTER
THE

[Captioner] 22:04:52
 EVICTION MORATORIUM ENDS, AND SEE
HOW WE CAN BE

[Captioner] 22:04:56
 BETTER PARTNERS WITH THE
COUNTY AND THE STATE AND SEE HOW WE CAN

[Captioner] 22:04:57

CONTINUE TO DO THE GOOD WORK WE'RE DOING


[Captioner] 22:05:01
AND I WOULD LOVE TO GET SOME MORE
FEEDBACK IN A FEW MONTHS TO SEE HOW THE

[Captioner] 22:05:04

PROGRAM IS GOING AND WHAT

[Captioner] 22:05:07
 HARMS THERE
ARE.
YOU KNOW, A LOT OF THESE ISSUES, THEY


[Captioner] 22:05:11
ALL SOUND GOOD BUT THERE ARE UNINTENDED
CONSEQUENCES AND WE HAVE

[Captioner] 22:05:14
 TO FLESH OUT
ALL THE DETAILS BEFORE WE START
INSTITUTING

[Captioner] 22:05:17
 POLICIES AT A WHOLE SCALE
SO AGAIN

[Captioner] 22:05:21
 I WOULD ENCOURAGE STAFF TO
CONTINUE THE WORK AND I THINK WE NEED

[Captioner] 22:05:23
 TO
WAIT ON SOME OF THE ITEMS THAT ARE
PROPOSED IN THIS CURRENT REFERRAL.


[Captioner] 22:05:26
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 22:05:30
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
NEXT IS COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL.


[Captioner] 22:05:35
>> Councilmember Campbell: OKAY.
WELL, THANK

[Captioner] 22:05:38
 YOU, AND I PROBABLY AM GOING
TO BE

[Captioner] 22:05:41
 A DIFFERENT VOICE IN THIS
CONVERSATION.
I'M SORRY.


[Captioner] 22:05:44
BECAUSE I AM A RENTER.
I HAVE BEEN A

[Captioner] 22:05:47
 RENTER HERE IN FREMONT FOR
QUITE A WHILE, SO I

[Captioner] 22:05:50
 DON'T THINK THAT
WE'RE HEARING FROM THE RENTAL

[Captioner] 22:05:54
 VOICE.
MY CHILDREN ARE ALSO RENTERS.


[Captioner] 22:06:01
AND I HAVE SOME STAFF IN MY OFFICE WHO
ARE

[Captioner] 22:06:04
 RENTERS WHO HAVE HAD SOME VERY
UNPLEASANT

[Captioner] 22:06:08
 EXPERIENCES.
BUT THAT'S NOT HOW I MAKE

[Captioner] 22:06:11
 A DECISION ON
WHAT'S

[Captioner] 22:06:14
 GOOD POLICY FOR THE CITY.
BUT I JUST WANTED TO PUT THAT OUT

[Captioner] 22:06:18
 THERE.


[Captioner] 22:06:21
AND I ALSO HAVE HAD FAMILY MEMBERS WHO
HAVE BEEN HOMELESS, SO

[Captioner] 22:06:24
 I UNDERSTAND MY
OWN SON WAS

[Captioner] 22:06:27
 HOMELESS, SO I UNDERSTAND
THE

[Captioner] 22:06:31
 IMPLICATIONS OF BEING

[Captioner] 22:06:34
 WITHOUT A
HOME, WITH BEING UNSHELTERED.
I'VE

[Captioner] 22:06:38
 WORKED WITH ABODE AND SOME OF THOSE
OTHER ORGANIZATIONS, AND

[Captioner] 22:06:41
 I'VE SEEN
FIRSTHAND

[Captioner] 22:06:44
 THE PAIN AND THE HARDSHIP
THAT'S

[Captioner] 22:06:48
 CAUSED BY NOT HAVING PERMANENT
HOUSING.
SO I'M

[Captioner] 22:06:51
 VERY, VERY SENSITIVE TO BOTH OF
THOSE ISSUES.


[Captioner] 22:06:55
AND I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT YOU HAVE TO

[Captioner] 22:06:58

PAY YOUR RENT.
I MEAN, EVEN THOUGH WE ARE

[Captioner] 22:07:01
 RENTERS, I'VE
NEVER BEEN LATE ON MY RENT, I'VE NEVER


[Captioner] 22:07:04
HAD TO TAKE ANY SUBSIDIES OR ANYTHING
ELSE LIKE THAT,

[Captioner] 22:07:07
 BUT I DO RECOGNIZE THAT
THAT IS A

[Captioner] 22:07:10
 REALITY FOR MANY, MANY
PEOPLE.


[Captioner] 22:07:14
FREMONT HAS A LOT OF WEALTHY PEOPLE WHO

[Captioner] 22:07:18

CAN AFFORD TO HAVE THEIR OWN HOME AND
ALSO

[Captioner] 22:07:21
 BE ABLE TO RENT OUT UNITS AS WELL.


[Captioner] 22:07:25
NOT EVERYBODY IN FREMONT CAN DO THAT.


[Captioner] 22:07:28
HAVING BEEN ON THE SCHOOL BOARD FOR 10
YEARS, I'VE

[Captioner] 22:07:32
 SEEN CHILDREN THAT HAVE BEEN
HOMELESS, AND

[Captioner] 22:07:35
 I RECOGNIZE THAT THAT IS
NOT THE

[Captioner] 22:07:39
 REALITY OF EVERYBODY IN
FREMONT.
AND IT

[Captioner] 22:07:42
 SADDENS ME TO SIT HERE AND

[Captioner] 22:07:45
 HEAR
FOLKS WHO ARE WEALTHY AND WHO HAVE

[Captioner] 22:07:48
 THE
ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO RENT OUT HOMES AND


[Captioner] 22:07:51
HAVE THEIR OWN HOME

[Captioner] 22:07:55
 AND NOT BE SENSITIVE
TO THE PLIGHT OF THOSE FOLKS

[Captioner] 22:07:58
 WHO DON'T.
SO I'M

[Captioner] 22:08:01
 JUST GOING TO PUT THAT OUT THERE
LIKE THAT.
SO I THINK

[Captioner] 22:08:05
 THAT WHAT COUNCILMEMBER
KASSAN IS

[Captioner] 22:08:08
 TRYING TO DO IS TO GET AHEAD
OF THE CURVE.


[Captioner] 22:08:11
WE DON'T KNOW -- YOU'RE RIGHT, WE DON'T
KNOW THAT THE MORATORIUM

[Captioner] 22:08:15
 IS GOING TO
CAUSE ANY

[Captioner] 22:08:19
 EVICTIONS, PARTICULARLY WITH
SB

[Captioner] 22:08:22
 SB731 THAT'S COMING OUT, IT MAY NOT.
WE DON'T KNOW.
AND WE DON'T

[Captioner] 22:08:25
 KNOW THE UNINTENDED
CONSEQUENCES OF THAT.


[Captioner] 22:08:29
I DO KNOW

[Captioner] 22:08:32
 THAT WHETHER I WAS RENTING,
EVERY YEAR, MY

[Captioner] 22:08:35
 RENT WENT UP.
EVERY YEAR, 5%,

[Captioner] 22:08:38
 WITHOUT FAIL.
BUT I GOT NOTHING IN RETURN FOR THAT.
I COULDN'T EVEN GET

[Captioner] 22:08:42
 A LONG TERM LEASE
WHEN I WAS

[Captioner] 22:08:45
 LEASING.
SO WE DON'T

[Captioner] 22:08:48
 KNOW WHAT WILL CHANGE OR
WHAT WON'T CHANGE.


[Captioner] 22:08:51
I CAN TELL FROM THE CONVERSATION HERE WE
HAVE NO

[Captioner] 22:08:55
 SUPPORT ON MOVING FORWARD WITH
EVEN TAKING A LOOK AT THE ORDINANCE TO


[Captioner] 22:08:59
SEE IF THERE'S SOMETHING THERE THAT

[Captioner] 22:09:02

MIGHT -- THAT MIGHT BENEFIT TENANTS.


[Captioner] 22:09:07
SO I'M JUST GOING TO LEAVE IT AT THAT
BECAUSE I THINK THAT IT'S A DOUBLE

[Captioner] 22:09:10
 EDGED
SWORD.
I MEAN,

[Captioner] 22:09:15
 BECAUSE THE LANDLORDS ARE BEING
IMPACTED,

[Captioner] 22:09:18
 TENANT ARE BEING IMPACTED SO I
DON'T KNOW WHERE THE MIDDLE IS UNTIL WE

[Captioner] 22:09:21

CAN ACTUALLY SEE IF THE RELEASE OF THE


[Captioner] 22:09:24
MORATORIUM IS GOING TO HAVE AN IMPACT.
SO I'M JUST GOING TO

[Captioner] 22:09:27
 LEAVE IT AT THAT.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 22:09:32
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
SO I

[Captioner] 22:09:35
 WANTED TO THANK EVERYONE FOR
SHARING THEIR COMMENTS, BOTH THE TENANTS


[Captioner] 22:09:39
AS WELL AS THE LANDLORDS AND ALSO MY
FELLOW COUNCILMEMBERS.


[Captioner] 22:09:42
I KNOW WE'VE HAD THIS CONVERSATION OVER
THE YEARS, AND IT IS CERTAINLY A VERY

[Captioner] 22:09:45

DIFFICULT TOPIC TO ADDRESS.
WE CAME UP WITH THE RENT

[Captioner] 22:09:48
 REVIEW PROCESS
BECAUSE WE BELIEVED THAT AT THAT TIME,


[Captioner] 22:09:51
WE HAD HEARD LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF
SPEAKER

[Captioner] 22:09:55
S COME TO US.
I ALSO WILL SAY THAT WHEN THIS FIRST

[Captioner] 22:09:57

CONVERSATION CAME INTO PLAY, I DID GO TO


[Captioner] 22:10:01
THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS MYSELF AND
SPEAK ON BEHALF

[Captioner] 22:10:04
 OF OUR CITY.
FOR THOSE WHO MAY NOT

[Captioner] 22:10:07
 KNOW IN THE PUBLIC
AT THAT TIME, OUR CITY WAS ONE OF THE
FIRST TO

[Captioner] 22:10:10
 PASS EVICTION MORATORIUM
THROUGH OUR

[Captioner] 22:10:13
 COUNCIL DECISION, AND
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN MADE THAT MOTION AT


[Captioner] 22:10:16
THAT TIME.
>>

[Captioner] 22:10:19
 STAFF REFERRALS.
WE HAVE NOT EVEN GOTTEN TO THE TWO
AGENDA ITEMS.


[Captioner] 22:10:23
>> Mayor Mei: EXCUSE ME?
OH, SORRY.


[Captioner] 22:10:27
SORRY, KIM.
OKAY.


[Captioner] 22:10:32
BUT I WANTED TO SAY THAT WE PASSED IT

[Captioner] 22:10:34

AND AT THAT TIME, I'D ALSO GONE TO THE


[Captioner] 22:10:37
BOARD OF SUPERVISORS SAYING THAT IT WAS
AN UNUSUAL SITUATION

[Captioner] 22:10:41
 WHERE THEY -- AS A
COUNTY -- OVERROAD US AND A LOT

[Captioner] 22:10:43
 OF THESE
SERVICES THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT, AND I


[Captioner] 22:10:47
KNOW THAT CITY MANAGER SHACKELFORD AND I
ACTUALLY WILL BE AT THE

[Captioner] 22:10:49
 MAYOR'S
CONFERENCE TOMORROW NIGHT TALKING ABOUT


[Captioner] 22:10:52
IT, AND DURING WHICH I DO APPRECIATE OUR
STAFF HAS WORKED VERY CLOSELY

[Captioner] 22:10:55
 WITH THE
COUNTY TO LOOK AT THESE PROCESSES.


[Captioner] 22:10:58
AND CERTAINLY IT'S NOT A ONE SIZE FITS
ALL.
BUT AT THE SAME

[Captioner] 22:11:02
 TIME, IT IS UNUSUAL FOR
US TO HAVE GONE THROUGH THIS PROCESS AND


[Captioner] 22:11:05
WE DID HAVE REPORTS THAT CAME OUT ON THE
CASES

[Captioner] 22:11:08
 THAT CAME BEFORE US, SO WE CAN
UNDERSTAND

[Captioner] 22:11:12
 THE IMPACT.
I DO THINK THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT

[Captioner] 22:11:15
 WHAT
THE IMPACT IS ONCE WE

[Captioner] 22:11:18
 LIFT THIS EVICTION
MORATORIUM.
IT IS UNUSUAL THAT WE ARE THE

[Captioner] 22:11:20
 COUNTY
THAT'S HELD IT THE LONGEST IN THE STATE


[Captioner] 22:11:23
OF CALIFORNIA.
I ALSO WANTED TO MAKE

[Captioner] 22:11:26
 SURE PEOPLE
FEEL -- I KNOW THAT AT TIMES SOME PEOPLE


[Captioner] 22:11:28
MAY FEEL LIKE THE RENTERS ARE NOT BEING
HEARD.


[Captioner] 22:11:31
I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE CASE, BECAUSE
IN ALL FAIRNESS, WHEN

[Captioner] 22:11:35
 WE HAD THE
PROCESSES FOR

[Captioner] 22:11:39
 PROVIDING RENTAL
ASSISTANCE, IT WAS

[Captioner] 22:11:42
 ORIGINALLY ONLY FOR
CITIES THAT WERE BIGGER

[Captioner] 22:11:46
 THAN 500,000 FOR
DIRECT ALLOCATION, I THINK, AND NONE OF


[Captioner] 22:11:49
US IN THE COUNTY.
AND I KNOW MYSELF AND OUR FELLOW MAYORS

[Captioner] 22:11:52

AND OTHERS DID GO FIGHT FOR THAT, SO
THAT'S WHY IT CAME DOWN TO

[Captioner] 22:11:55
 CITIES THAT
WERE BIGGER THAN 200,000 OR MORE, AND WE

[Captioner] 22:11:57

WERE ABLE TO GET A DIRECT ALLOCATION TO


[Captioner] 22:12:00
THE CITY OF FREMONT, AND I REALLY WANT
TO THANK OUR TEAM

[Captioner] 22:12:04
 AND OUR STAFF WHO MADE
A LOT OF EFFORTS, YOU MAY HAVE SEEN AT

[Captioner] 22:12:06

THE CONCERTS IN THE PARK AND OTHER AREAS


[Captioner] 22:12:10
AND OUR STAFF JUST REALLY WENT OUT
REALLY HARD TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE

[Captioner] 22:12:13
 KNEW
ABOUT THE PROGRAMS AND GOT PEOPLE
ENLISTED IN IT, AND EVEN IN

[Captioner] 22:12:16
 THIS PROCESS
NOW, AS WE MOVE FORWARD, WE ARE NOT DONE


[Captioner] 22:12:20
IN SUPPORTING OUR COMMUNITY, BECAUSE I
THINK THAT'S SOMETHING WE NEED TO

[Captioner] 22:12:23

CONTINUALLY DO IN

[Captioner] 22:12:27
 REPRESENTING ALL
MEMBERS,

[Captioner] 22:12:30
 LANDLORDS OR TENANTS.
I'VE EXPRESSED AT THAT TIME TOO THAT MY


[Captioner] 22:12:33
PARENTS HAD ONE PROPERTY WHEN I WAS
GOING THROUGH SCHOOL AND JUST PAUSE WE


[Captioner] 22:12:35
HAD ONE PROPERTY, IT WASN'T BECAUSE THEY
WERE WEALTHY.


[Captioner] 22:12:38
MY PARENTS WERE IMMIGRANTS AND WHEN THEY
HAD PROBLEMS WITH THAT

[Captioner] 22:12:41
 PROPERTY, THEY
DID ALL THE WORK THEMSELVES.
MY DAD FIXED THE

[Captioner] 22:12:45
 TOILETS, MY DAD PAINTED
THE WALLS, DRY CLEANED -- WE WERE THERE


[Captioner] 22:12:48
OURSELVES DOING IT.
IT WASN'T LIKE WE WERE BIG LANDLORDS OR

[Captioner] 22:12:50

ANYTHING ELSE, BUT THAT PUT ME THROUGH


[Captioner] 22:12:53
COLLEGE.
AND SO I WANTED PEOPLE TO KNOW THAT EVEN


[Captioner] 22:12:56
IF YOU CAN AFFORD IT, IT'S NOT
NECESSARILY A LUXURY.
IT WAS

[Captioner] 22:12:59
 SOMETHING THAT WAS A STRUGGLE FOR
US TO BE ABLE TO AFFORD AND ALSO TO

[Captioner] 22:13:03

MAINTAIN.
SO I'M

[Captioner] 22:13:06
 HOPEFUL THAT WHEN WE WORK WITH
THE COUNTY AS WE MOVE FORWARD AND I KNOW

[Captioner] 22:13:08

OUR HUMAN SERVICES DEPARTMENT AS WELL AS


[Captioner] 22:13:12
OUR STAFF AND OUR FELLOW MAYORS ARE
GOING TO BE LOOKING

[Captioner] 22:13:15
 AT THIS, BUT I DO
THINK THAT WE NEED TO WAIT TO SEE WHAT


[Captioner] 22:13:18
HAPPENS A LITTLE BIT.
IT'S NOT THAT WE ARE ONLY WAIT AND SEE,


[Captioner] 22:13:21
BECAUSE THIS WHOLE TIME DURING THIS
PANDEMIC, EVERY SINGLE

[Captioner] 22:13:24
 MONTH WE'VE BEEN
TALKING ABOUT THIS, AND WE HAVE BEEN

[Captioner] 22:13:27

CONTINUALLY LOOKING AT IT AND IT
SOMETHING THAT

[Captioner] 22:13:30
 WHEN IT COMES TO
HOMELESSNESS AND IMPACTS, I THINK THAT


[Captioner] 22:13:34
ALL OF US HAVE EXPRESSED UNANIMOUSLY ON
THE

[Captioner] 22:13:37
 COUNCIL THAT WE CARE ABOUT, AND I
THINK THAT A LOT OF THE

[Captioner] 22:13:40
 TOPICS THAT HAVE
BEEN ADDRESSED SUCH AS BUILDING THE

[Captioner] 22:13:44

HOUSING, CREATING THE WORKFORCE
DEVELOPMENT, PROVIDING THE WRAP-AROUND

[Captioner] 22:13:45

SERVICES ARE GOING TO BE CRITICAL FOR
THIS.


[Captioner] 22:13:50
AND SO I DO WANT

[Captioner] 22:13:53
 TO THANK COUNCILMEMBER
KASSAN FOR BRINGING THIS ITEM

[Captioner] 22:13:55
 TO OUR
DISCUSSION BUT I THINK AT THIS TIME I'M


[Captioner] 22:13:58
NOT SUPPORTING IT MOVING FORWARD BECAUSE
I FEEL THAT I WANTED TO SEE WHAT THE


[Captioner] 22:14:01
COUNTY AND THE LEGISLATION THAT HAS BEEN
APPROVED, WHEN IT TAKES EFFECT, WHAT

[Captioner] 22:14:04
 THE
IMPACTS WILL BE AND HOW WE SEE MOVING
FORWARD.


[Captioner] 22:14:07
SO I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S ANY OTHER
COMMENTS AT THIS TIME?

[Captioner] 22:14:11
 ON THIS ITEM?


[Captioner] 22:14:14
SEEING NONE, AT THIS TIME, I THINK WE'RE
ACTUALLY ALMOST DUE FOR

[Captioner] 22:14:16
 ANOTHER BREAK
BEFORE WE CONTINUE WITH THE TWO ITEMS.


[Captioner] 22:14:20
I APOLOGIZE.
BUT SO I THINK THAT

[Captioner] 22:14:25
 --
>> ARE WE GOING TO VOTE?
>> Mayor Mei: BUT YOU NEED

[Captioner] 22:14:29
 A SECOND

[Captioner] 22:14:32
 TO
GET THE VOTE.
IS THERE SOMEONE WHO WOULD LIKE TO 

[Captioner] 22:14:35
MAKE
A SECOND ON THIS REFERRAL?


[Captioner] 22:14:39
SEEING NONE, AT THIS TIME

[Captioner] 22:14:43
 -- OKAY, WOULD
YOU LIKE TO MAKE THE MOTION, PLEASE?
>> Councilmember Kassan:

[Captioner] 22:14:46
 SO IF PEOPLE
WOULD BE WILLING TO BE ON RECORD WITH
THEIR POSITION, I THINK WE

[Captioner] 22:14:49
 SHOULD VOTE
ON IT.


[Captioner] 22:14:52
I WOULD LIKE TO MOVE THAT WE ADOPT THE
REFERRAL TO ASK STAFF

[Captioner] 22:14:55
 TO LOOK AT WHETHER
THERE NEEDS TO BE ANY CHANGES TO

[Captioner] 22:15:00
 THE
ORDINANCE.
>> Mayor Mei: IS

[Captioner] 22:15:03
 THERE ANYONE WHO
WOULD LIKE TO SECOND IT?
>> Councilmember Campbell:

[Captioner] 22:15:04
 I'LL
SECOND.
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY.


[Captioner] 22:15:08
PLEASE VOTE.
>> Councilmember Salwan: I'D LIKE TO
MAKE A SUBSTITUTE

[Captioner] 22:15:10
 MOTION.
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY.
>> Councilmember Salwan: I WOULD LIKE


[Captioner] 22:15:13
TO MAKE A SUBSTITUTE MOTION THAT WE ASK
STAFF TO CONTINUE TO LOOK

[Captioner] 22:15:17
 AT AVAILABLE
RESOURCES AND OTHER PROGRAM

[Captioner] 22:15:19
 OPTIONS TO
SUPPORT TENANTS AND LANDLORDS

[Captioner] 22:15:23
 AFTER
EVICTION MORATORIUM EXPIRES.


[Captioner] 22:15:27
>> Councilmember Cox: SECOND.
>> Mayor Mei: SO THIS

[Captioner] 22:15:29
 IS -- JUST TO
CLARIFY FOR EVERYONE IN THE AUDIENCE AS


[Captioner] 22:15:33
WELL AS THE STAFF, THIS IS VOTING ON THE

[Captioner] 22:15:34

SUBSTITUTE MOTION TO CONTINUE TO LOOK AT


[Captioner] 22:15:38
OTHER WAYS THAT WE CAN SUPPORT

[Captioner] 22:15:41
 TENANTS
AFTER THE EVICTION MORATORIUM

[Captioner] 22:15:42
 EXPIRES.
>> Councilmember Kassan: I DON'T THINK


[Captioner] 22:15:45
WE NEED A MOTION FOR THAT.
THEY'RE ALREADY DOING THAT AND THAT'S --


[Captioner] 22:15:48
I THINK THAT'S A COP OUT.
>> Councilmember Salwan: NO, THEY ARE
NOT.


[Captioner] 22:15:51
>> Mayor Mei: I THINK THAT THERE'S A
SUBSTITUTE MOTION AND A SECOND SO WE
NEED TO

[Captioner] 22:15:54
 VOTE, PLEASE.
>> Councilmember Salwan: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 22:16:04
THE SUBSTITUTE MOTION PASSES WITH
COUNCILMEMBER

[Captioner] 22:16:07
 KASSAN VOTING NAY.
AND AT THIS TIME, WE'RE

[Captioner] 22:16:11
 GOING TO TAKE A
10-MINUTE BREAK BEFORE WE RESUME WITH
THE OTHER TWO

[Captioner] 22:16:14
 AGENDA ITEMS.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 22:24:19
>> Mayor Mei: I'D LIKE TO CALL THE
COUNCIL, TRY TO GET THEM BACK ON

[Captioner] 22:24:22
 TO THE
DAIS.
I THINK THE STAFF AND ALL OF

[Captioner] 22:24:25
 US -- SO
I'D LIKE TO CALL EVERYONE BACK TO THE
ORDER.


[Captioner] 22:24:34
GOOD EVENING.
WE DON'T WANT

[Captioner] 22:24:37
 TO BE GOOD MORNING.


[Captioner] 22:25:03
THANK YOU TO ALL WHO HAVE JOINED US THIS
EVENING.


[Captioner] 22:25:08
AND SHARED THEIR FEEDBACK AND ALSO THANK
YOU TO ALL THE

[Captioner] 22:25:12
 COUNCILMEMBERS WHO ARE
MAKING THE MOTIONS AND DISCUSSIONS

[Captioner] 22:25:15
.
I'D LIKE TO CALL THE MEETING BACK TO
ORDER AND WE'RE GOING TO

[Captioner] 22:25:18
 RESUME WITH
ITEM 5A, WHICH IS

[Captioner] 22:25:21
 THE 2023 UPDATES TO
THE FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION,

[Captioner] 22:25:24
 AND THERE
IS NO

[Captioner] 22:25:27
 PRESENTATION THIS EVENING, BUT OUR
PUBLIC WORKS DIRECTOR,

[Captioner] 22:25:31
 HANS LARSEN, IS
AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS.
AND I

[Captioner] 22:25:34
 BELIEVE WHAT WE'RE DOING, BECAUSE
I THINK IT ALSO WENT BEFORE

[Captioner] 22:25:37
 THE PLANNING
COMMISSION, IF I SAW THAT, AND WHAT
WE'RE DOING IS

[Captioner] 22:25:41
 UPDATING THE ORDINANCE TO
REFLECT THE VERBIAGE THAT

[Captioner] 22:25:44
 IS CONSISTENT
WITH THAT WHICH IS PRESENTED AT THE
STATE

[Captioner] 22:25:47
 LEVEL IN THE MUNICIPAL CODE AND
THERE ARE UPDATES RECENTLY,

[Captioner] 22:25:51
 I THINK.
IF THAT'S INCORRECT, PLEASE FEEL FREE TO


[Captioner] 22:25:54
CORRECT ME, HANS,

[Captioner] 22:25:57
 BUT I THINK IT'S A
LITTLE LONGER IN THE HOUR AT THIS POINT,

[Captioner] 22:26:01

SO -- BUT I THINK IT'S PRETTY CLEAR IN


[Captioner] 22:26:06
TERMS OF IF IT A CONSISTENT UPDATE TO
REFLECT THOSE CHANGES THAT HAVE

[Captioner] 22:26:09
 BEEN
MADE.


[Captioner] 22:26:14
>> Mr. Larsen: MAYOR MEI

[Captioner] 22:26:17
, ESSENTIALLY
WHAT WE'RE DOING IS UPDATING

[Captioner] 22:26:21
 TO
REPRESENT FEDERAL BEST PRACTICES SO
FREMONT CONTINUES

[Captioner] 22:26:24
 TO QUALIFY FOR
DISCOUNTS ON FLOOD INSURANCE FOR

[Captioner] 22:26:26

PROPERTY OWNERS THAT ARE WITHIN
FLOODPLAINS.


[Captioner] 22:26:30
AND AGAIN, THIS WAS REVIEWED BY THE

[Captioner] 22:26:32

PLANNING COMMISSION AND APPROVED
UNANIMOUSLY.


[Captioner] 22:26:38
>> Mayor Mei: I SEE COUNCILMEMBER COX,
DO YOU HAVE QUESTIONS ON THIS OR
COMMENTS ON

[Captioner] 22:26:41
 THIS ITEM?
>> Councilmember Cox:

[Captioner] 22:26:45
 NO.
I WAS GOING TO SAY THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR


[Captioner] 22:26:49
THE PRESENTATION AND THE DETAILS OF WHAT
WE'RE CHANGING, HERE IT

[Captioner] 22:26:52
 IS, HERE'S THE
CHANGE.
IT WAS VERY CLEAR AND I

[Captioner] 22:26:56
 APPRECIATE THAT
FOR EASY READING FOR SOME OF US GETTING

[Captioner] 22:26:59

TO THE DETAILS THERE.
I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE

[Captioner] 22:27:02
 A MOTION TO ACCEPT
THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE CITY

[Captioner] 22:27:06
 STAFF.
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: THROUGH THE
CHAIR, THIS IS AN ITEM THAT

[Captioner] 22:27:07
 REQUIRES A
PUBLIC HEARING.
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY.


[Captioner] 22:27:10
>> Councilmember Cox: WELL, AFTER THE
PUBLIC HEARING.
TECHNICALITY.


[Captioner] 22:27:13
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
I WAS GOING TO NOTE THAT.
SO I'D LIKE TO

[Captioner] 22:27:17
 OPEN THE PUBLIC HEARING.
AND ARE THERE

[Captioner] 22:27:20
 ANY MEMBERS WHO WISH TO
ADDRESS

[Captioner] 22:27:23
 THIS ITEM, EITHER ON ZOOM OR VIA
PHONE?
AT THIS

[Captioner] 22:27:26
 TIME I'D LIKE TO JUST ASK
MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WISHING TO SPEAK

[Captioner] 22:27:29

ON ITEM 5A, THE 2023 UPDATE,

[Captioner] 22:27:32
 THE FLOOD
DAMAGE PREVENTION ORDINANCE, IF THEY ARE


[Captioner] 22:27:35
HERE, TO SUBMIT A CARD, IF NOT, IF
THEY'RE ON ZOOM, TO DO SO BY

[Captioner] 22:27:38
 CLICKING
THE RAISE HAND ICON OR PRESSING
STAR NINE.


[Captioner] 22:27:44
>> Mr. Quintanilla: WE DO NOT HAVE ANY
SPEAKER CARDS OR ANY HANDS

[Captioner] 22:27:45
 RAISED ON
ZOOM.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.


[Captioner] 22:27:49
I'D LIKE TO CLOSE THE PUBLIC HEARING.
I'D LIKE

[Captioner] 22:27:52
 TO RETURN THEN TO COUNCILMEMBER
COX AND A SECOND BY COUNCILMEMBER

[Captioner] 22:27:55
 SALWAN
OR DO YOU HAVE A COMMENT?
>> Councilmember

[Captioner] 22:27:58
 Salwan: SECOND BUT I
HAVE A QUESTION.
I REMEMBER I

[Captioner] 22:28:01
 HAD SENT SOMETHING LIKE
THIS AROUND GRIMMER,

[Captioner] 22:28:04
 IRVINGTON AREA.
WOULD THIS APPLY TO THOSE PARCELS THAT


[Captioner] 22:28:08
HAD -- THAT COULDN'T GET INSURANCE OR
THEY HAD TO

[Captioner] 22:28:11
 GET EXTRA INSURANCE, IS THIS
PART OF THAT?
>> Mr.

[Captioner] 22:28:15
 Larsen: YES, SO ANY PROPERTY
THAT'S IN A FEDERALLY

[Captioner] 22:28:18
 DESIGNATED
FLOODPLAIN IS REQUIRED TO PAY INSURANCE,


[Captioner] 22:28:21
SO THIS ACTION ESSENTIALLY ALLOWS
PROPERTY

[Captioner] 22:28:24
 OWNERS TO CONTINUE TO HAVE A
DISCOUNT ON THEIR

[Captioner] 22:28:28
 INSURANCE.
>> Councilmember Salwan: OKAY.
>> Mr. Larsen: THE ISSUE, IF I RECALL

[Captioner] 22:28:30

CORRECTLY, IS, THERE ARE MEMBERS IN THE


[Captioner] 22:28:34
COMMUNITY THAT ARE ADVOCATING FOR FLOOD
CONTROL

[Captioner] 22:28:37
 IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS WITH
ALAMEDA COUNTY

[Captioner] 22:28:41
 FLOOD CONTROL DISTRICT
THAT WOULD ACTUALLY TAKE THEM OUT OF THE

[Captioner] 22:28:43

FLOODPLAIN AND THEY WOULD NO LONGER HAVE


[Captioner] 22:28:46
TO PAY INSURANCE.
BUT THAT'S A SEPARATE

[Captioner] 22:28:49
 ITEM FROM WHAT'S
ON THE AGENDA HERE TODAY.
>> Councilmember Salwan: GOT IT.


[Captioner] 22:28:51
THANK YOU.
MY SECOND STANDS.
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY.


[Captioner] 22:28:55
MOTION AND SECONDED.


[Captioner] 22:28:58
I SEE ALSO COUNCILMEMBER SHAO BUT WE'RE
GOING TO TAKE -- I'M GOING TO CALL 

[Captioner] 22:28:58
THE
VOTE.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 22:29:03
SO PLEASE VOTE.


[Captioner] 22:29:10
THANK YOU.
THE MOTION FOR ITEM 5A PASSES
UNANIMOUSLY.


[Captioner] 22:29:13
DO YOU NEED TO READ THE ORDINANCE?


[Captioner] 22:29:17
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: THANK YOU,
MAYOR.
THE ORDINANCE TITLE IS AN ORDINANCE 

[Captioner] 22:29:20
OF
THE CITY OF FREMONT AMENDING TITLE 18,

[Captioner] 22:29:23

 CHAPTER 18.200 FLOOD DAMAGE
PREVENTION OF THE FREMONT

[Captioner] 22:29:26
 MUNICIPAL CODE
TO AMEND DEFINITIONS, PROCEDURES AND
STANDARDS

[Captioner] 22:29:30
 RELATED TO BOTH DEVELOPMENT
AND USE OF PROPERTY

[Captioner] 22:29:33
 WITHIN THE CITY AND
THE ZONING MAP AMENDMENT TO REZONE
CERTAIN

[Captioner] 22:29:36
 PROPERTY WITHIN THE CITY TO
PROVIDE CONFORMITY WITH THE

[Captioner] 22:29:38
 GENERAL PLAN
LAND USE MAP.
THANK YOU, MAYOR.


[Captioner] 22:29:41
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 22:29:44
THANK YOU, HANS.
AND

[Captioner] 22:29:48
 AT THIS TIME, I'D LIKE TO

[Captioner] 22:29:52
 INTRODUCE
THE FINAL AGENDA ITEM THIS EVENING,
WHICH IS ITEM 6A,

[Captioner] 22:29:55
 WHICH IS THE FISCAL
YEAR

[Captioner] 22:30:00
 2022-2023 MID YEAR BUDGET REPORT.
AND I BELIEVE

[Captioner] 22:30:03
 OUR FINANCE DIRECTOR DAVE
PERSSELIN HAS

[Captioner] 22:30:06
 A PRESENTATION.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 22:30:28
>> Mr. Persselin: GOOD EVENING, MAYOR
AND COUNCIL.
TONIGHT I'LL BE PRESENTING

[Captioner] 22:30:31
 A BRIEF
REVIEW OF RECENT ECONOMIC AND REVENUE

[Captioner] 22:30:34

TRENDS, DISCUSS REVISED REVENUE AND
EXPENDITURE PROJECTIONS

[Captioner] 22:30:37
 FOR THE CURRENT
YEAR, PROVIDE A PRELIMINARY GENERAL FUND


[Captioner] 22:30:40
FORECAST FOR THE NEXT THREE YEARS, AND
PRESENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR

[Captioner] 22:30:43
 MID YEAR
BUDGET ADJUSTMENTS.


[Captioner] 22:30:52
YOU MAY RECALL THAT AT THIS TIME A YEAR
AGO, WE WERE

[Captioner] 22:30:56
 PROJECTING GROSS DOMESTIC
PRODUCT, THE PRIMARY INDICATOR OF
ECONOMIC

[Captioner] 22:31:00
 ACTIVITY, TO GROW AT A HEALTHY
RATE DURING 2022.


[Captioner] 22:31:04
WE CAUTIONED, HOWEVER, THAT
PANDEMIC-RELATED

[Captioner] 22:31:07
 SUPPLY CHAIN
DISRUPTIONS COMBINED

[Captioner] 22:31:10
 WITH STRONG DEMAND
M PROMPTED BY FISCAL STIMULUS PROGRAMS


[Captioner] 22:31:13
HAD PRODUCED UNUSUALLY HIGH LEVELS OF
INFLATION, AND THAT THE

[Captioner] 22:31:17
 IMPOSITION OF
SANCTIONS IN RESPONSE TO THE RUSSIAN
INVASION

[Captioner] 22:31:20
 OF UKRAINE WOULD LIKELY DISRUPT
INTERNATIONAL

[Captioner] 22:31:23
 TRADE.
WE'RE STILL LIVING WITH

[Captioner] 22:31:27
 RELATIVELY HIGH
INFLATION AND OTHER ECONOMIC
CONSEQUENCES OF

[Captioner] 22:31:30
 THE ONGOING WAR IN
UKRAINE.
BUT THE

[Captioner] 22:31:33
 U.S. ECONOMY HAS PROVED TO BE
RESILIENT.


[Captioner] 22:31:37
AFTER SMALL CONTRACTIONS IN THE FIRST
HALF OF LAST

[Captioner] 22:31:40
 YEAR, GROSS DOMESTIC
PRODUCT GREW AT

[Captioner] 22:31:43
 A 3% RATE IN THE SECOND
HALF OF THE YEAR.


[Captioner] 22:31:46
ADDITIONALLY, THE LABOR MARKET REMAINS
UNUSUALLY

[Captioner] 22:31:50
 TIGHT, WITH UNEMPLOYMENT RATE
AT

[Captioner] 22:31:53
 HISTORICALLY LOW LEVELS.
TO COMBAT INFLATION,

[Captioner] 22:31:56
 THE FEDERAL RESERVE
HAS RAISED INTEREST RATES REPEATEDLY
OVER

[Captioner] 22:32:00
 THE LAST YEAR.
AND MAY CONTINUE TO RAISE RATES

[Captioner] 22:32:03
 THROUGH
THE MIDDLE OF 2023.


[Captioner] 22:32:06
THE COMBINATION OF HIGHER PRICES AND
HIGHER

[Captioner] 22:32:09
 INTEREST RATES HAS LED TO A
DECLINE IN CONSUMER

[Captioner] 22:32:12
 CONFIDENCE, WHICH
ULTIMATELY COULD RESULT IN AN ECONOMIC

[Captioner] 22:32:15

SLOWDOWN OR A RECESSION LATER THIS
YEAR.


[Captioner] 22:32:21
OUR PRELIMINARY REVENUE FORECAST ASSUMES

[Captioner] 22:32:23

SUSTAINED ECONOMIC GROWTH, BUT WE NEED


[Captioner] 22:32:27
TO RECOGNIZE THAT OUR COMMUNITY FACES
SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY.


[Captioner] 22:32:31
THIS YEAR'S ADOPTED BUDGET WAS BASED ON
THE ASSUMPTION

[Captioner] 22:32:35
 THAT OUR LOCAL ECONOMY
AND GENERAL FUND REVENUES WOULD

[Captioner] 22:32:38
 CONTINUE
TO RECOVER FROM THE

[Captioner] 22:32:41
 PANDEMIC-RELATED
RECESSION.
THAT HAS LARGELY BEEN THE CASE,

[Captioner] 22:32:44
 WITH A
FEW NOTABLE EXCEPTIONS.


[Captioner] 22:32:48
FIRST, RISING INTEREST RATES HAVE COOLED
WHAT HAD

[Captioner] 22:32:52
 BEEN A VERY STRONG HOUSING
MARKET.
SO WE

[Captioner] 22:32:55
 SHOULD EXPECT PROPERTY TAX REVENUE
GROWTH TO SLOW,

[Captioner] 22:32:59
 STARTING NEXT FISCAL
YEAR.


[Captioner] 22:33:02
SECOND, WE'VE CONTINUED TO SEE
UNPRECEDENTED GROWTH IN SALES TAX

[Captioner] 22:33:06

REVENUE FROM NEW AUTO SALES.
THAT WAS

[Captioner] 22:33:10
 PRODUCED A LARGE AMOUNT OF
UNBUDGETED REVENUE IN THE

[Captioner] 22:33:13
 CURRENT YEAR,
AND WE'VE ASSUMED A

[Captioner] 22:33:17
 SIGNIFICANT INCREASE
IN ONGOING SALES TAX REVENUE IN THE
PRELIMINARY FORECAST.


[Captioner] 22:33:21
FINALLY, AS IT DID LAST YEAR, HOTEL TAX

[Captioner] 22:33:23

REVENUE IS RECOVERING MORE RAPIDLY THAN


[Captioner] 22:33:27
WE ASSUMED IT WOULD.


[Captioner] 22:33:31
I'LL START BY POINTING OUT THAT FISCAL
RECOVERY FUNDS

[Captioner] 22:33:35
 OF $22.1 MILLION RECEIVED

[Captioner] 22:33:38

IN FISCAL YEAR 2021-22 ARE INCLUDED

[Captioner] 22:33:41
 IN
THE OTHER REVENUE CATEGORY.
YOU'LL RECALL THAT WE

[Captioner] 22:33:45
 USE THOSE FEDERAL
FUNDS TO BALANCE THE CURRENT YEAR

[Captioner] 22:33:49

ADOPTED BUDGET.
THE STRONG

[Captioner] 22:33:52
 LOCAL REAL ESTATE MARKET WE
EXPERIENCED IN CALENDAR

[Captioner] 22:33:56
 YEAR 2021 IS
DRIVING OUR

[Captioner] 22:34:00
 WERE AN ESTIMATED 8% YEAR
OVER YEAR GROWTH IN PROPERTY TAX
REVENUE, BUT

[Captioner] 22:34:03
 THIS YEAR'S HIGHER MORTGAGE
RATES HAVE LED TO DECLINES IN BOTH THE

[Captioner] 22:34:06

NUMBER OF SALES AND THEIR VALUE.
WE'LL BE MEETING

[Captioner] 22:34:09
 WITH STAFF FROM THE
COUNTY ASSESSOR'S

[Captioner] 22:34:12
 OFFICE AT THE END OF
MARCH TO HEAR THEIR INITIAL ESTIMATES
FOR NEXT

[Captioner] 22:34:16
 YEAR'S ASSESSED VALUES.


[Captioner] 22:34:19
AS IT WAS, WHEN I PRESENTED THE 2021-22

[Captioner] 22:34:23

YEAR-END REPORT LAST FALL, THE BIG STORY


[Captioner] 22:34:27
CONTINUES TO BE SALES TAX.
THROUGH THE FIRST TWO QUARTERS OF

[Captioner] 22:34:31
 THIS
FISCAL YEAR, WE'VE RECEIVED OVER
$61 MILLION OF SALES TAX

[Captioner] 22:34:34
 REVENUE.
THAT'S

[Captioner] 22:34:37
 ABOUT $27 MILLION MORE THAN WE
ANTICIPATED.
MOST OF

[Captioner] 22:34:40
 THAT CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO
CONTINUING GROWTH IN NEW

[Captioner] 22:34:43
 AUTO SALES,
ALONG WITH SOME ONE-TIME

[Captioner] 22:34:46
 PRIOR-YEAR
ADJUSTMENTS FROM THE STATE.
BECAUSE OUR

[Captioner] 22:34:50
 SHARE OF COUNTY POOLED SALES
IN

[Captioner] 22:34:53
 USE TAX REVENUES IS BASED ON OUR
SHARE OF

[Captioner] 22:34:56
 COUNTYWIDE LOCAL SALES TAX
REVENUES.
WE'RE

[Captioner] 22:35:00
 SEEING UNUSUALLY HIGH LEVELS OF
REVENUE IN THAT

[Captioner] 22:35:03
 POOL CATEGORY AS WELL.
IN TOTAL, WE'RE PROJECTING

[Captioner] 22:35:06
 TO RECEIVE
OVER $37 MILLION MORE IN

[Captioner] 22:35:09
 SALES TAX
REVENUE THIS YEAR THAN WE BUDGETED.


[Captioner] 22:35:15
REFLECTING THE DRAMATICALLY HIGHER LEVEL
OF SALES

[Captioner] 22:35:18
 TACK WE'VE RECEIVED OVER THE
LAST YEAR, THE PRELIMINARY FORECAST

[Captioner] 22:35:22
 FOR
ONGOING SALES TAX REVENUE HAS BEEN
INCREASED

[Captioner] 22:35:25
 BY ABOUT 30%.


[Captioner] 22:35:29
KNOWING THAT LAST YEAR'S BUSINESS TAX
REVENUE WAS

[Captioner] 22:35:32
 ENHANCED BY THE PAYMENT OF
PRIOR-YEAR TAXES DELAYED BY THE
PANDEMIC,

[Captioner] 22:35:35
 WE BUDGETED FOR A DECLINE.
ALTHOUGH IT

[Captioner] 22:35:38
 DOES APPEAR THAT THIS YEAR
WE'LL

[Captioner] 22:35:41
 STILL FALL

[Captioner] 22:35:45
 BELOW, BUSINESS
ACTIVITY, EMPLOYMENT AND WAGES HAVE MADE


[Captioner] 22:35:49
UP MOST OF THE DIFFERENCE.
THE ADOPTED BUDGET ASSUMED THAT

[Captioner] 22:35:51
 HOTEL
TAX WOULD RECOVER AT WHAT WE THOUGHT WAS


[Captioner] 22:35:55
A RELATIVELY AGGRESSIVE RATE OF 27%.


[Captioner] 22:35:59
AS YOU CAN SEE, IT'S NOW PROJECTED TO
GROW BY

[Captioner] 22:36:02
 OVER 42%.
IF IT CONTINUES ON ITS CURRENT

[Captioner] 22:36:05
 PACE,
HOTEL TAX WILL EXCEED THE

[Captioner] 22:36:09
 BUDGET
ESTIMATE BY ABOUT $1.2 MILLION.
IMOWN

[Captioner] 22:36:12
 ALMOST ALL OF THE $700,000
OVERPERFORMANCE IN THE

[Captioner] 22:36:15
 OTHER CATEGORY IS
DUE TO HIGHER INVESTMENT EARNINGS

[Captioner] 22:36:18
 ON THE
CITY'S CASH PORTFOLIO AS A RESULT

[Captioner] 22:36:21
 OF
INCREASING INTEREST RATES.


[Captioner] 22:36:26
IN TOTAL, GENERAL FUND REVENUES ARE
PROJECTED TO FINISH THE

[Captioner] 22:36:29
 YEAR ALMOST
$44 MILLION ABOVE

[Captioner] 22:36:33
 THE ADOPTED BUDGET
ESTIMATE.


[Captioner] 22:36:38
THE FIRST COLUMN ON THIS SLIDE SHOWS THE
ACTUAL REVENUES

[Captioner] 22:36:41
 AND EXPENDITURES FOR
LAST FISCAL YEAR.
THE

[Captioner] 22:36:45
 REVENUES ROW INCLUDES $22.1 MILLION

[Captioner] 22:36:48

OF FISCAL RECOVERY FUNDS THAT
CONSTITUTES JUST OVER

[Captioner] 22:36:51
 HALF OF THE
UNRESERVED FUND BALL ABC YOU SEE AS

[Captioner] 22:36:55

BALANCE

[Captioner] 22:36:59
 YOU SEE FOR THE CURRENT BUDGET
IN THE SECOND COLUMN.
WE USE THOSE

[Captioner] 22:37:02
 FISCAL RECOVERY FUNDS TO
BALANCE THE CURRENT YEAR'S BUDGET, WHICH


[Captioner] 22:37:06
WAS REVISED TO INCLUDE ABOUT

[Captioner] 22:37:09

$3.9 MILLION OF COSTS RELATED TO THE
LABOR AGREEMENTS THAT WERE FINALIZED

[Captioner] 22:37:12

AFTER THE BUDGET WAS ADOPTED.


[Captioner] 22:37:15
BECAUSE WE FINISHED LAST FISCAL YEAR
WITH SOME

[Captioner] 22:37:18
 UNANTICIPATED FUND BALANCE AS
PART OF THE

[Captioner] 22:37:22
 YEAR-END REPORT, THE CITY
COUNCIL INCREASED THE

[Captioner] 22:37:25
 BUDGET UNCERTAINTY
RESERVE BY TWOP

[Captioner] 22:37:28
 $.5 MILLION TO
$12.5 MILLION, WHICH CONSTITUTES ALMOST

[Captioner] 22:37:31

HALF OF THE $5.6 MILLION ADDITION

[Captioner] 22:37:35
 TO
RESERVE IN THE CURRENT YEAR

[Captioner] 22:37:38
 BUDGET
COLUMN.
THE CITY COUNCIL APPROPRIATED THE

[Captioner] 22:37:41

REMAINING UNANTICIPATED ENDING FUND
BALANCE AS A TRANSFER TO

[Captioner] 22:37:44
 THE CAPITAL
IMPROVEMENTS FUND.


[Captioner] 22:37:48
THE $288 MILLION OF REVENUE SHOWN IN THE
FAR

[Captioner] 22:37:51
 RIGHT ESTIMATE COLUMN CORRESPONDS TO
THE TOTAL SHOWN ON

[Captioner] 22:37:54
 THE PREVIOUS SLIDE.
AND

[Captioner] 22:37:57
 ALMOST $44 MILLION INCREASE FROM THE
BUDGET AMOUNT.


[Captioner] 22:38:01
YOU MAY RECALL THAT WE INCLUDE IN THE
EXPENDITURE

[Captioner] 22:38:04
 BUDGET A SAVINGS ASSUMPTION
TO REFLECT

[Captioner] 22:38:08
 THE CITY'S HISTORICAL
EXPERIENCE OF UNDERSPENDING

[Captioner] 22:38:11
 TOTAL KATEED
RESOURCES, PRIMARILY DUE TO SALARY

[Captioner] 22:38:14

SAVINGS FROM VACANT POSITIONS.
THIS YEAR'S

[Captioner] 22:38:18
 SAVINGS ASSUMPTION WAS
$8 MILLION.
BUT

[Captioner] 22:38:21
 AT MID YEAR, WE'RE ON TRACK TO SEE
MORE THAN TWICE THAT

[Captioner] 22:38:26
 SAVINGS.
DUE PRIME  LY TO THE CONTINUING HIGH

[Captioner] 22:38:30
 AND
CONSISTENT LEVEL OF VACANCIES.
YOU CAN SEE THOSE PROJECTED

[Captioner] 22:38:33
 ADDITIONAL
SAVINGS OF $13 MILLION BY

[Captioner] 22:38:36
 COMPARING THE
ADJUSTED BUDGET EXPENDITURES AND

[Captioner] 22:38:40

TRANSFERS OUT AMOUNT WITH WHAT WE'RE
SHOWING IN THE ESTIMATE COLUMN.


[Captioner] 22:38:44
THE COMBINATION OF INCREASED REVENUES
AND ADDITIONAL

[Captioner] 22:38:48
 SAVINGS TOTALS 56

[Captioner] 22:38:51
 PONT
$7 MILLION.
THESE ESTIMATES WILL CHANGE AS

[Captioner] 22:38:55
 THE
FISCAL YEAR PROGRESSES AND WE RECEIVE
MORE REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE


[Captioner] 22:39:03
INFORMATION.
AS A REMINDER, THE CITY COUNCIL HAS
ESTABLISHED TWO GENERAL FUND

[Captioner] 22:39:07
 RESERVES.
THE CONTINGENCY RESERVE

[Captioner] 22:39:10
 FUNDED BY
COUNCIL POLICY AT

[Captioner] 22:39:14
 16.7% OF BUDGETED
EXPENDITURES AND TRANSFERS OUT IS

[Captioner] 22:39:17

INTENDED TO MITIGATE THE EFFECTS OF
NATURAL DISASTERS

[Captioner] 22:39:20
 AND OTHER SEVERE
UNFORESEEN EVENT.


[Captioner] 22:39:25
THE BUDGET UNCERTAINTY RESERVE IS
INTENDED

[Captioner] 22:39:28
 TO OFFSET REVENUE SHORTFALLS
AND

[Captioner] 22:39:31
 UNANTICIPATED COST INCREASES WITH
THE COAL OF

[Captioner] 22:39:35
 PROVIDING SUFFICIENT
RESOURCES TO MAINTAIN SERVICE LEVELS

[Captioner] 22:39:37

WHILE GIVING THE CITY AN OPPORTUNITY TO


[Captioner] 22:39:40
RESPOND TO ITS BUDGETARY CHALLENGES.


[Captioner] 22:39:45
WE MADE USE OF THIS RESERVE DURING THE
INITIAL PHASE OF THE PANDEMIC TO

[Captioner] 22:39:48
 PREVENT
SERVICE DISRUPTIONS.


[Captioner] 22:39:51
AS I MENTIONED ON THE LAST SLIDE, THE
CITY COUNCIL WAS ABLE TO INCREASE THE

[Captioner] 22:39:54

BUDGET UNCERTAINTY RESERVE TO 12.5 MILL

[Captioner] 22:39:57

YOP DOLLARS AS PART OF THE FISCAL YEAR


[Captioner] 22:40:01
2021-22 YEAR-END REPORT.


[Captioner] 22:40:07
THE PRELIMINARY GENERAL FUND FORECAST
SHOWN ON THIS SLIDE INCLUDES THE

[Captioner] 22:40:10

CURRENT-YEAR ESTIMATE I'VE JUST
DISCUSSED, ALONG WITH PROJECTIONS FOR


[Captioner] 22:40:14
THE NEXT THREE FISCAL YEARS.
THOSE

[Captioner] 22:40:17
 REVENUE PROJECTIONS ARE BASED ON
THE MOST

[Captioner] 22:40:21
 CURRENT INFORMATION AVAILABLE
AND TAKE INTO ACCOUNT

[Captioner] 22:40:24
 HISTORICAL TRENDS,
CURRENT YEAR PERFORMANCE THROUGH MID
YEAR,

[Captioner] 22:40:28
 PROJECTED DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY,
AND SCHEDULED CHANGES IN

[Captioner] 22:40:31
 VARIOUS FEES
AND RATES.
THESE PRELIMINARY

[Captioner] 22:40:34
 PROJECTIONS ARE BASED
ON THE EXPECTATION

[Captioner] 22:40:37
 THAT OUR LOCAL
ECONOMY WILL REMAIN HEALTHY.
BUT THE

[Captioner] 22:40:41
 GROWTH IN PROPERTY TAX

[Captioner] 22:40:45
 WILL GROW
AS THE STATE MARKET ADJUSTS TO A LESS

[Captioner] 22:40:48

FAVORABLE INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT.
AS I MENTIONED EARLIER, A SIGNIFICANT


[Captioner] 22:40:51
PORTION OF THE SALES TAX GROWTH WE'VE
RECENTLY EXPERIENCED HAS BEEN

[Captioner] 22:40:53
 CARRIED
FORWARD IN THE FORECAST AS ONGOING
REVENUE.


[Captioner] 22:40:58
AS PART OF THE PROPOSED OPERATING
BUDGET,

[Captioner] 22:41:01
 WE'LL LIKELY BE RECOMMENDING
THAT COUNCIL

[Captioner] 22:41:04
 INCREASE THE BUDGET
UNCERTAINTY RESERVE TO ACCOMMODATE

[Captioner] 22:41:08
 THAT
ADDITIONAL RISK.


[Captioner] 22:41:12
THE EXPENDITURE PROJECTIONS ARE NET OF
ESTIMATED

[Captioner] 22:41:15
 CITY-WIDE SAVINGS OF 6.5% OF

[Captioner] 22:41:18

BUDGETED EXPENDITURES IN EACH YEAR,

[Captioner] 22:41:22
 THE
HISTORICAL AVERAGE.
AND INCLUDE ADJUSTMENTS

[Captioner] 22:41:25
 TO REFLECT
CALPERS' PENSION CONTRIBUTION

[Captioner] 22:41:29
 INCREASES,
RETIREE HEALTHCARE CONTRIBUTIONS,

[Captioner] 22:41:33

SCHEDULED DEBT SERVICE PAYMENTS AND
CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS,

[Captioner] 22:41:36
 INCLUDING LABOR
AGREEMENTS.
IN ACCORDANCE

[Captioner] 22:41:39
 WITH THE CITY COUNCIL'S
PENSION LIABILITY FUNDING

[Captioner] 22:41:43
 POLICY, AN
ADDITIONAL HAS BEEN INCLUDED

[Captioner] 22:41:46
 IN EACH
YEAR AS WELL.
AS THIS FORECAST IS

[Captioner] 22:41:50
 PRELIMINARY, THE
EXPENDITURES SHOWN REPRESENT

[Captioner] 22:41:53
 A BASE
BUDGET THAT DELIVERS THE

[Captioner] 22:41:56
 EXISTING LEVEL
OF SERVICES WITH NO ASSUMED STAFFING
INCREASES.


[Captioner] 22:42:01
BECAUSE THE CITY'S LABOR AGREEMENTS
EXPIRE ON

[Captioner] 22:42:04
 JUNE 30, 2025, NO COMPENSATION
INCREASES HAVE BEEN

[Captioner] 22:42:08
 ASSUMED IN THE
FISCAL YEAR

[Captioner] 22:42:11
 2025-26 EXPENDITURE
PROJECTION.


[Captioner] 22:42:15
THESE EXPENDITURE LEVELS MAY INCREASE AS

[Captioner] 22:42:18

THE FISCAL YEAR 2023-24

[Captioner] 22:42:20
 PROPOSED
OPERATING BUDGET IS DEVELOPED WITH THE


[Captioner] 22:42:24
BENEFIT OF ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.
INCLUDING ANY

[Captioner] 22:42:27
 RECOMMENDATIONS FOR
EXPANDED

[Captioner] 22:42:30
 SERVICES OR SERVICE LEVEL
ENHANCEMENTS.
AS YOU CAN

[Captioner] 22:42:33
 SEE, REVENUES EXCEED

[Captioner] 22:42:35

EXPENDITURES IN EACH OF THE FORECAST
YEARS.


[Captioner] 22:42:38
I'D LIKE TO REMIND THE COUNCIL, HOWEVER,

[Captioner] 22:42:41

THAT THIS PRELIMINARY FORECAST DOES NOT


[Captioner] 22:42:45
INCORPORATE SPENDING IN CREASES FOR
NECESSARY PARKS AND

[Captioner] 22:42:48
 BUILDINGS
MAINTENANCE, ADDITIONAL PUBLIC SAFETY
STAFFING,

[Captioner] 22:42:51
 OR ENHANCED SERVICES THAT WILL
BE INCLUDED IN THE PROPOSED

[Captioner] 22:42:55
 BUDGET.


[Captioner] 22:43:01
AS I MENTIONED CURRENT REVENUE
PROJECTIONS

[Captioner] 22:43:06
 ARE EXCEEDING THEIR BUDGETED
ESTIMATES BY $41.6 MILLION.


[Captioner] 22:43:10
AND EXPENDITURES ARE PROJECTED TO FALL
BELOW THE BUDGETED

[Captioner] 22:43:14
 APPROPRIATIONS BY
$13 MILLION.
STAFF

[Captioner] 22:43:17
 RECOMMENDS THAT THE CITY COUNCIL
INCREASE THE BUDGET ESTIMATES

[Captioner] 22:43:20
 FOR THOSE
THREE REVENUES AND THE EXPENDITURE

[Captioner] 22:43:23

SAVINGS ESTIMATE TO MATCH THE CURRENT
PROJECTIONS.


[Captioner] 22:43:28
AT THE SAME TIME, STAFF IS RECOMMENDING
THREE

[Captioner] 22:43:32
 APPROPRIATION ACTIONS TO ADDRESS
PRIORITY NEEDS.


[Captioner] 22:43:36
A FOURTH SET OF ACTIONS TO PAY OFF A
PORTION OF

[Captioner] 22:43:39
 THE CITY'S DEBT WILL BE
PRESENTED

[Captioner] 22:43:42
 SEPARATELY FOR COUNCIL
CONSIDERATION

[Captioner] 22:43:45
 LATER IN THE FISCAL YEAR.
THE FIRST RECOMMENDATION IS TO

[Captioner] 22:43:48
 RESTORE
THE UNRESERVED BALANCE IN THE RISK
MANAGEMENT

[Captioner] 22:43:51
 FUND.
THAT FUND IS USED TO MAINTAIN
SELF-INSURANCE

[Captioner] 22:43:55
 RESERVES FOR WORKER'S
COMPENSATION AND GENERAL LIABILITY
CLAIMS.


[Captioner] 22:43:59
AND TO PAY INSURANCE PREMIUMS FOR

[Captioner] 22:44:02
 EXCESS
CLAIMS LIABILITY AND PROPERTY COVERAGE.


[Captioner] 22:44:05
IN ADDITION TO THE SELF-INSURANCE
RESERVES, THE

[Captioner] 22:44:08
 RISK MANAGEMENT FUND ALSO
INCLUDES AN

[Captioner] 22:44:11
 UNRESERVED BALANCE, TARGETED
AT $3 MILLION, THAT IS USED

[Captioner] 22:44:15
 TO MAKE
ACTUARIALLY DETERMINED ADJUSTMENTS TO
THE RESERVE

[Captioner] 22:44:18
 LEVELS.
AS PART OF THE BUDGET BALANCING

[Captioner] 22:44:22
 ACTIONS
INCLUDED IN THE FISCAL YEAR

[Captioner] 22:44:25
 2020-21
BUDGET, ANNUAL OPERATING FUND
CONTRIBUTIONS

[Captioner] 22:44:28
 TO THE RISK MANAGEMENT
FUND WERE REDUCED TO

[Captioner] 22:44:31
 A LEVEL THAT
APPEARED TO BE SUSTAINABLE.


[Captioner] 22:44:35
HOWEVER, OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS, A
COMBINATION

[Captioner] 22:44:38
 OF INCREASING CLAIMS COSTS
AND RISING INSURANCE

[Captioner] 22:44:42
 PREMIUMS HAVE
DEPLETED THE UNRESERVED

[Captioner] 22:44:45
 BALANCE.


[Captioner] 22:44:48
STAFF IS RECOMMENDING THE CITY COUNCIL
ALLOCATE $3.5 MILLION

[Captioner] 22:44:51
 OF ADDITIONAL
GENERAL FUND REVENUE TO RESTORE THE
UNRESERVED

[Captioner] 22:44:54
 FUND BALANCE TO ITS TARGETED
LEVEL.


[Captioner] 22:45:00
THE SECOND RECOMMENDATION IS TO
ESTABLISH A RESERVE FOR THE CITY'S
UNFUNDED ACCRUED LEAVE

[Captioner] 22:45:04
 LIABILITY.
EACH YEAR THE CITY'S

[Captioner] 22:45:07
 UNFUNDED LIABILITY
FOR EARNED BUT

[Captioner] 22:45:10
 UNUSED VACATION LEAVE
INCREASES

[Captioner] 22:45:13
.
THE MAXIMUM ACCRUAL FOR EACH EMPLOYEE IS


[Captioner] 22:45:16
CAPPED.
BUT THE VALUE INCREASES AT THE

[Captioner] 22:45:19
 SAME RATE
AS THE ANNUAL COMPENSATION INCREASES.


[Captioner] 22:45:24
FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2022, THE

[Captioner] 22:45:26

UNFUNDED LIABILITY WAS APPROXIMATELY
$13.5 MILLION.


[Captioner] 22:45:32
WHILE A PORTION OF ACCRUED LEAVE CAN BE
PAID OUT TO SOME

[Captioner] 22:45:35
  EMPLOYEES
DURING THE YEAR, ALL ACCRUED LEAVE

[Captioner] 22:45:39
 IS
PAYABLE ON TERMINATION OR RETIREMENT.


[Captioner] 22:45:44
THE GENERAL FUND ANNUAL OPERATING BUDGET
CURRENTLY

[Captioner] 22:45:47
 INCLUDES $1.4 MILLION TO
ADDRESS THE COST OF THESE PAYOUTS

[Captioner] 22:45:50
 ON A

[Captioner] 22:45:54

PAY-AS-YOU-GO BASIS.
BUT AS WITH OUR UNFUNDED PENSION AND

[Captioner] 22:45:56

RETIREE HEALTHCARE LIABILITIES, IT WOULD


[Captioner] 22:45:59
BE MORE PRUDENT TO ESTABLISH A RESERVE
TO ENSURE THAT

[Captioner] 22:46:03
 SUFFICIENT FUNDS ARE
AVAILABLE TO MEET THE INCREASING

[Captioner] 22:46:06
 COST OF
THESE OBLIGATIONS.


[Captioner] 22:46:10
THE RESERVE WOULD BE USED INSTEAD OF THE
GENERAL FUND AND THE OTHER

[Captioner] 22:46:13
 OPERATING
FUNDS TO MAKE ACCRUED LEAVE PAYMENTS.


[Captioner] 22:46:17
AND EACH YEAR THE GENERAL FUND AND THE
OTHER OPERATING

[Captioner] 22:46:20
 FUNDS WOULD MAKE
CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE RESERVE, REFLECTING

[Captioner] 22:46:23

THE VALUE OF THAT YEAR'S UNEARNED BUT
UNUSED LEAVE.


[Captioner] 22:46:28
TO ACCOMMODATE THE ADDITIONAL LEAVE
HOURS EARNED

[Captioner] 22:46:32
 BUT UNUSED IN THE CURRENT
YEAR, AND RECOGNIZING THAT THE

[Captioner] 22:46:35
 PRIOR
YEAR UNFUNDED LEAVE LIABILITY IS
INCREASING AT THE SAME RATE

[Captioner] 22:46:39
 AS SALARIES,
BETWEEN 5% AND 6%, STAFF

[Captioner] 22:46:43
 IS RECOMMENDING
THAT THE CITY COUNCIL

[Captioner] 22:46:46
 ALLOCATE
$15 MILLION TO ESTABLISH AN ACCRUED
LEAVE RESERVE.


[Captioner] 22:46:52
THE THIRD RECOMMENDATION IS TO PROVIDE
ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR

[Captioner] 22:46:55
 PRIORITY
MAINTENANCE AND CAPITAL NEEDS.
ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS OVER

[Captioner] 22:46:58
 THE LAST YEAR,
STAFF HAS PRESENTED TO THE CITY COUNCIL

[Captioner] 22:47:01

A LIST OF CRITICAL MAINTENANCE AND
CAPITAL

[Captioner] 22:47:04
 REPLACEMENT NEEDS, AS WELL AS
UNFUNDED FUTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENT.


[Captioner] 22:47:09
THESE INCLUDE MAJOR CITY INITIATIVES
SUCH AS

[Captioner] 22:47:12
 THE PARKS MASTER PLAN AND
CLIMATE ACTION PLAN, BUT

[Captioner] 22:47:15
 ALSO TRAFFIC
SIGNAL MODERNIZATION, REPLACEMENT

[Captioner] 22:47:19
 OF
DETERIORATING FACILITIES IN CENTRAL
PARK,

[Captioner] 22:47:23
 AND TECHNOLOGY UPGRADES.
ALTHOUGH THE COST OF THESE

[Captioner] 22:47:26
 UNFUNDED
NEEDS FAR EXCEEDS THE RESOURCES
AVAILABLE

[Captioner] 22:47:30
, THE UNANTICIPATED INCREASE IN
CURRENT YEAR REVENUE CREATES AN
OPPORTUNITY

[Captioner] 22:47:33
 TO MAKE PROGRESS ON THE
HIGHEST PRIORITY

[Captioner] 22:47:36
 PROJECTS.
TO CREATE THE CAPACITY

[Captioner] 22:47:40
 TO FUND SOME OF
THESE PROJECTS IN THE NEXT CAPITAL
IMPROVEMENT

[Captioner] 22:47:43
 PLAN, STAFF RECOMMENDS THAT
THE CITY COUNCIL

[Captioner] 22:47:46
 APPROPRIATE $25 MILLION
OF THE ADDITIONAL REVENUE AS A TRANSFER


[Captioner] 22:47:50
TO THE CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS FUND.
AS A

[Captioner] 22:47:54
 REMINDER, THE CITY COUNCIL WILL BE
HOLDING

[Captioner] 22:47:57
 A WORK SESSION ON THE CAPITAL
IMPROVEMENT PLAN AS PART OF NEXT WEEK'S

[Captioner] 22:48:00

REGULARLY SCHEDULED MEETING.
IN

[Captioner] 22:48:03
 TOTAL, THESE THREE RECOMMENDATIONS
WILL ACCOUNT

[Captioner] 22:48:07
 FOR $43.5 MILLION OF THE

[Captioner] 22:48:10

$74.5 MILLION PROJECTED UNRESERVED FUND


[Captioner] 22:48:13
BALANCE.
AS PART OF THE FISCAL

[Captioner] 22:48:16
 YEAR 2023-24
PROPOSED OPERATING BUDGET,

[Captioner] 22:48:19
 STAFF WILL
LIKELY BE RECOMMENDING THAT A PORTION OF


[Captioner] 22:48:23
THE REMAINING UNRESERVED FUND BALANCE BE
USED TO INCREASE

[Captioner] 22:48:26
 THE GENERAL FUND BUDGET
UNCERTAINTY RESERVE.


[Captioner] 22:48:35
TO RECAP, THE NATIONAL ECONOMY IS
EXPANDING AND MOST OF OUR GENERAL
REVENUES ARE

[Captioner] 22:48:38
 GROWING AT A HEALTHY PACE.
HOWEVER, THE COMBINATION OF

[Captioner] 22:48:41
 HIGH PRICES
AND HIGH INTEREST RATES COULD LEAD TO AN


[Captioner] 22:48:45
ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN OR RECESSION NEXT
FISCAL YEAR.


[Captioner] 22:48:49
THE CURRENT YEAR COMBINATION OF HIGHER
THAN ANTICIPATED REVENUE

[Captioner] 22:48:52
 AND EXPENDITURE
SAVINGS IS PROVIDING US WITH

[Captioner] 22:48:55
 THE
OPPORTUNITY TO SET ASIDE ONE-TIME
FUNDING

[Captioner] 22:48:59
 TO ADDRESS INCREASING COSTS IN
OUR RISK

[Captioner] 22:49:02
 MANAGEMENT FUND, ESTABLISH A
RESERVE FOR OUR UNFUNDED

[Captioner] 22:49:05
 ACCRUED LEAVE
LIABILITY, AND PAY FOR CRITICAL
MAINTENANCE

[Captioner] 22:49:08
 AND CAPITAL REPLACEMENT
NEEDS, AS WELL AS UNFUNDED

[Captioner] 22:49:12
 FUTURE
CAPITAL INVESTMENTS.


[Captioner] 22:49:17
WE ANTICIPATE PRESENTING THE FISCAL YEAR

[Captioner] 22:49:21

2023-24 PROPOSED OPERATING BUDGET TO THE


[Captioner] 22:49:24
CITY COUNCIL ON MAY 16TH.
THE FIRST PUBLIC HEARING ON THE PROPOSED

[Captioner] 22:49:27

OPERATING BUDGET WILL BE HELD ON
JUNE 6TH WITH THE SECOND PUBLIC

[Captioner] 22:49:30
 HEARING
AND BUDGET ADOPTION SCHEDULED FOR
JUNE 13TH.


[Captioner] 22:49:34
THAT COMPLETES MY PRESENTATION.
I'LL TURN THE MEETING BACK OVER TO

[Captioner] 22:49:36
 THE
MAYOR AND I'M READY TO TAKE YOUR
QUESTIONS.


[Captioner] 22:49:41
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU, DIRECTOR
PERSSELIN, FOR THE PRESENTATION

[Captioner] 22:49:44
 AND FOR
STAYING WITH US THIS EVENING.
I'LL BEGIN WITH OUR

[Captioner] 22:49:47
 COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN
FOR QUESTIONS, CLARIFYING QUESTIONS AT

[Captioner] 22:49:49

THIS TIME.
>> Councilmember Salwan: THANK YOU,


[Captioner] 22:49:52
MADAME MAYOR, AND THANK YOU,
MR. PERSSELIN, FOR THE WONDERFUL
PRESENTATION.


[Captioner] 22:49:54
A LOT OF GOOD THINGS HAPPENING SO THAT'S
GREAT.


[Captioner] 22:49:59
SO REGARDING THE THREE ITEMS, I
UNDERSTAND THE

[Captioner] 22:50:03
 RISK MANAGEMENT FUND.
ACCRUED LEAVE, WE KIND

[Captioner] 22:50:06
 OF TALKED ABOUT,
BUT DOES IT CARRY OVER FROM YEAR TO

[Captioner] 22:50:07

YEAR?
>> Mr. Persselin: YES, IT DOES.


[Captioner] 22:50:12
>> Councilmember Salwan: OKAY.
AND THEN IT COMPOUNDS OVER TIME?


[Captioner] 22:50:14
>> Mr. Persselin: CORRECT.
>> Councilmember Salwan: IS THERE A
WAY TO LIMIT THAT YEAR TO YEAR?


[Captioner] 22:50:17
>> Mr. Persselin: NO, THERE'S NOT.
>> Councilmember Salwan: OKAY.
THAT'S NOT

[Captioner] 22:50:20
 GOOD.
>> Mr. Persselin: IT IS CAPPED.
FOR EACH EMPLOYEE.


[Captioner] 22:50:24
BUT UP TO THE CAP, THAT AMOUNT CARRIES
OVER

[Captioner] 22:50:27
 WITH THEM FOR THE REMAINING PORTION
OF THEIR CAREER

[Captioner] 22:50:31
 WITH THE CITY, AND AT
THE POINT WHERE THEY CASH OUT,

[Captioner] 22:50:32
 WHETHER
THEY'RE TERMINATING EMPLOYMENT WITH THE


[Captioner] 22:50:36
CITY OR WHETHER THEY'RE RETIRING, IT
GETS PAID OUT, ALL

[Captioner] 22:50:39
 OF THOSE HOURS GET
PAID OUT AT WHATEVER THEY WERE

[Captioner] 22:50:41
 EARNING
AT THE TIME OF TERMINATION OR
RETIREMENT.


[Captioner] 22:50:44
>> Councilmember Salwan: THAT'S PART
OF THE CONTRACT WITH THE EMPLOYEE

[Captioner] 22:50:47
S.
>> Mr. Persselin: CORRECT.
>> Councilmember Salwan: THEY'RE


[Captioner] 22:50:50
ALLOWED TO SAVE UP OVER TIME?
>> Mr. Persselin:

[Captioner] 22:50:53
 CORRECT.
>> Councilmember Salwan: OKAY.
AND THEN THE 25 MILLION SOUNDS LIKE A


[Captioner] 22:50:56
BIG CHUNK.
YOU MENTIONED SOME BUT CAN WE

[Captioner] 22:50:59
 GET MORE
SPECIFICS AS WE GET CLOSE INVENTORY
SPECIFICALLY WHERE

[Captioner] 22:51:02
 THE $25 MILLION IS
GOING TO GO?
>> Mr. Persselin: YES, AND THAT WILL


[Captioner] 22:51:05
BE A GOOD POINT TO TALK ABOUT AT NEXT
WEEK'S STUDY SESSION ON THE

[Captioner] 22:51:07
 CAPITAL
IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM.
>> Councilmember Salwan: GREAT.


[Captioner] 22:51:10
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.


[Captioner] 22:51:14
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
NEXT IS COUNCILMEMBER SHAO.
>> City Mgr.

[Captioner] 22:51:16
 Shackelford: MADAME
MAYOR, MAY I SAY SOMETHING IN RESPONSE


[Captioner] 22:51:20
TO THE LAST QUESTION THAT COUNCILMEMBER
SALWAN

[Captioner] 22:51:23
 ASKED ABOUT THE $25 MILLION?
>> Mayor Mei: SURE.
>> City Mgr. Shackelford: I JUST

[Captioner] 22:51:27
 WANT
TO PUT IT IN CONTEXT TO SAY THAT WE
PROBABLY HAVE A

[Captioner] 22:51:31
 BILLION DOLLAR CIP
NEED.
SO RELATIVE TO THAT,

[Captioner] 22:51:35
 THE 25 MILLION
THAT'S BEING PROPOSED HERE TONIGHT IS

[Captioner] 22:51:37

JUST REALLY A DROP IN THE BUCKET, BASED


[Captioner] 22:51:41
ON EVERYTHING THAT WE NEED TO DO.
BUT YOU WILL HAVE

[Captioner] 22:51:43
 MORE DETAILS NEXT
WEEK.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 22:51:47
YES, THAT'S OUR NEXT BIG TOPIC FOR THE
NEXT

[Captioner] 22:51:51
 MEETING.
WE CAN LOOK AT THE PREVIOUS ONES,

[Captioner] 22:51:52
 COUPLE
HUNDRED PAGES TOO.
COUNCILMEMBER SHAO.


[Captioner] 22:51:56
>> Councilmember Shao: THANK YOU,
MADAME MAYOR.
THANK YOU AGAIN

[Captioner] 22:52:00
 FOR THE CAUTIOUSLY
OPTIMISTIC NEWS

[Captioner] 22:52:03
.
MY QUESTION IS REGARDING THE FIVE
RECOMMENDATION

[Captioner] 22:52:07
 ITEMS.
I

[Captioner] 22:52:10
 CAN SEE IT TAKES THE CITY COUNCIL TO
APPROVE

[Captioner] 22:52:16
 THE MONEY TO DIFFERENT BUCKETS,
BUT

[Captioner] 22:52:19
 I WONDER, WHAT'S THE SIGNIFICANCE

[Captioner] 22:52:22

FOR THE CITY COUNCIL TO APPROVE THE

[Captioner] 22:52:25

INCREASE OF ESTIMATE?
ESTIMATE IS

[Captioner] 22:52:28
 AN ESTIMATE, AND FROM YOUR
PRESENTATION, YOU

[Captioner] 22:52:32
 CAME UP WITH THE
ESTIMATE WITH

[Captioner] 22:52:35
 SOLID DATA.
AND I -- YOU

[Captioner] 22:52:41
 KNOW, REGARD THAT AS

[Captioner] 22:52:43
 A --
FACT, EVEN THOUGH YOU CALL IT AN
ESTIMATE.


[Captioner] 22:52:46
SO ONCE AGAIN THE QUESTION IS WHY DO WE
HAVE

[Captioner] 22:52:50
 TO TAKE THAT RECOMMENDATION TO
INCREASE

[Captioner] 22:52:53
 THE ESTIMATE?
>> Mr. Persselin: SO

[Captioner] 22:52:56
 WHEN WE ADOPT THE
BUDGET, WHEN THE CITY COUNCIL

[Captioner] 22:52:59
 APPROVES
THE BUDGET, THE CITY COUNCIL IS ACTUALLY

[Captioner] 22:53:02

APPROVING BOTH A SET OF REVENUE
ESTIMATES THAT WILL BE USED

[Captioner] 22:53:06
 TO FUND
SERVICES, AND

[Captioner] 22:53:09
 THE APPROPRIATIONS, THE
EXPENDITURE APPROPRIATIONS FOR THOSE
SERVICES.


[Captioner] 22:53:13
YOU WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO ADOPT

[Captioner] 22:53:15

APPROPRIATIONS FOR EXPENDITURES IF YOU


[Captioner] 22:53:18
DIDN'T HAVE REVENUES OR OTHER SOURCES OF
FUNDING TO SUPPORT

[Captioner] 22:53:22
 THOSE EXPENDITURES.
SO BECAUSE WE'RE MAKING A

[Captioner] 22:53:25
 RECOMMENDATION
TO INCREASE EXPENDITURE

[Captioner] 22:53:29
 APPROPRIATIONS,
AND WE ALREADY HAVE WHAT'S ESSENTIALLY A

[Captioner] 22:53:32

BALANCED BUDGET,

[Captioner] 22:53:35
 WE NEED COUNCIL TO
INCREASE THE REVENUE ESTIMATES IN THE
BUDGET AS WELL.


[Captioner] 22:53:40
>> Councilmember Shao: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 22:53:45
>> Mayor Mei: SORRY.
NEXT IS COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL.


[Captioner] 22:53:50
>> Councilmember Campbell: THANK YOU
FOR THE PRESENTATION,

[Captioner] 22:53:53
 AND ALSO ANSWERING
SEVERAL OF MY QUESTIONS

[Captioner] 22:53:56
 PRIOR TO THE
MEETING.
I

[Captioner] 22:54:00
 JUST HAD -- SINCE I JUST SAW A COUPLE
OTHER THINGS.


[Captioner] 22:54:03
YOU MENTIONED -- I THINK THERE WAS LIKE

[Captioner] 22:54:07

A $21 MILLION THAT WAS GOING

[Captioner] 22:54:10
 TO -- THAT
YOU HAD TO PUT

[Captioner] 22:54:13
 INTO THE BUDGET -- INTO

[Captioner] 22:54:16

REVENUE TO BALANCE THE BUDGET FROM LAST

[Captioner] 22:54:19

YEAR, IS THAT CORRECT?
>> Mr. Persselin: YES.


[Captioner] 22:54:22
SO YOU MAY BE AWARE OF THE AMERICAN
RESCUE PLAN ACT FISCAL

[Captioner] 22:54:26
 RECOVERY FUNDS
THAT WERE ALLOCATED

[Captioner] 22:54:29
 TO STATES AND
COUNTIES AND CITIES.
SO THE CITY

[Captioner] 22:54:32
 OF FREMONT RECEIVED FISCAL
RECOVERY

[Captioner] 22:54:35
 FUNDS FROM THE FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT BOTH LAST YEAR

[Captioner] 22:54:38
 AND THE YEAR
BEFORE.
THOSE

[Captioner] 22:54:41
 FISCAL RECOVERY FUNDS COULD BE
USED FOR A VARIETY OF

[Captioner] 22:54:45
 PURPOSES, BUT THE
PURPOSE THAT THE MAJORITY OF GOVERNMENTS


[Captioner] 22:54:48
LIKE OURS HAVE USED THEM FOR IS TO
ESSENTIALLY

[Captioner] 22:54:51
 BACKFILL FOR REVENUES THAT
WE DID NOT

[Captioner] 22:54:55
 RECEIVE AS A RESULT OF THE
PANDEMIC.
SO

[Captioner] 22:54:58
 BASICALLY OUR REVENUES DROPPED
BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC, AND

[Captioner] 22:55:01
 WE WERE
ABLE TO USE THOSE FISCAL

[Captioner] 22:55:05
 RECOVERY FUNDS
TO RESTORE OR -- REAL STORE SERVICES

[Captioner] 22:55:08

THAT HAVE BEEN CUT AS I ALLUDED TO
EARLIER, WE

[Captioner] 22:55:11
 CUT A NUMBER OF EXPENDITURE
ITEMS IN THE 2021 BUDGET,

[Captioner] 22:55:14
 AND THEN WE
WERE ABLE TO RESTORE AND THEN MAINTAIN


[Captioner] 22:55:17
THOSE SERVICES IN THE CURRENT YEAR,
USING THE FISCAL RECOVERY FUNDS.


[Captioner] 22:55:20
>> Councilmember Campbell: OKAY,
GREAT.
THAT'S REALLY VERY HELPFUL.


[Captioner] 22:55:25
AND THEN ON

[Captioner] 22:55:29
 PAGE

[Captioner] 22:55:32
 -- HOLD ON ONE SECOND.
OKAY.
I HATE ACRONYMS.


[Captioner] 22:55:36
SO ON PAGE 6 AT THE BOTTOM, YOU HAVE

[Captioner] 22:55:39
 A
LITTLE STAR THERE THAT'S A

[Captioner] 22:55:42
 GFOA.


[Captioner] 22:55:46
WHAT DOES THAT STAND FOR?


[Captioner] 22:55:49
>> Mr. Persselin: ONE OF MY FAVORITE
ACRONYMS, THE GOVERNMENT

[Captioner] 22:55:51
 FINANCE
OFFICERS ASSOCIATION.
>> Councilmember Campbell: OKAY.


[Captioner] 22:55:55
SO THEY RECOMMEND A 16.7%?


[Captioner] 22:55:59
>> Mr. Persselin: THAT'S CORRECT.
THAT'S THE MINIMUM BEST

[Captioner] 22:56:02
 
PRACTICE.
>> Councilmember Campbell: AND THAT'S


[Captioner] 22:56:05
TWO MONTHS OF OPERATING ECK PEPS FOR
EXPENSES, RIGHT?


[Captioner] 22:56:08
>> Mr. Persselin: THAT'S CORRECT.
>> Councilmember Campbell: OKAY.
AND THEN MY LAST QUESTION

[Captioner] 22:56:11
 THAT I DIDN'T
SEE BEFORE WAS, OH,

[Captioner] 22:56:15
 THIS $15 MILLION
TRANSFER FOR THIS

[Captioner] 22:56:19
 UNFUNDED LEAVE
LIABILITY, THIS WOULD BE NEW,

[Captioner] 22:56:22
 RIGHT?
>> Mr. Persselin: THAT'S CORRECT.
WE DON'T CURRENTLY

[Captioner] 22:56:25
 HAVE ANY FUNDS SET
ASIDE TO ADDRESS THAT LIABILITY.
>> Councilmember

[Captioner] 22:56:28
 Campbell: OKAY.
AND WHAT IS THE ESTIMATED VALUE OF

[Captioner] 22:56:32
 THAT?
>> Mr. Persselin: SO WE REPORT EACH

[Captioner] 22:56:34

YEAR IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND WE


[Captioner] 22:56:38
DO SOME ANALYSIS.
BASICALLY

[Captioner] 22:56:41
 IT'S $13.5 MILLION AS OF THE
END OF LAST YEAR.


[Captioner] 22:56:45
WE'RE RECOMMENDING $15 MILLION BECAUSE
WE KNOW

[Captioner] 22:56:48
 EACH YEAR EMPLOYEES USELESS

[Captioner] 22:56:51

LEAVE THAN THEY'VE ACTUALLY EARNED, SO


[Captioner] 22:56:54
THERE'S AN INCREMENTAL INCREASE IN THE
HOURS,

[Captioner] 22:56:58
 AND THEN THE VALUE OF THOSE HOURS
INCREASES

[Captioner] 22:57:02
 EACH YEAR BY THE COMPENSATION
CHANGE.


[Captioner] 22:57:06
SO FOR THE CURRENT YEAR

[Captioner] 22:57:09
, THE
COMPENSATION INCREASES

[Captioner] 22:57:12
 ARE EITHER 5% OR

[Captioner] 22:57:15

6%, DEPENDING ON WHICH BARGAINING UNIT


[Captioner] 22:57:18
YOU'RE IN.
>> Councilmember Campbell: BUT THAT
WOULD MEAN

[Captioner] 22:57:22
 THAT IF YOU PAY AS YOU GO, IT
WOULD

[Captioner] 22:57:25
 BE DEPLETED IN A YEAR.


[Captioner] 22:57:29
>> Mr. Persselin: SO THE $1.4 MILLION
THAT I REFERRED TO IS ACTUALLY

[Captioner] 22:57:32
 WHAT
WE'RE BUDGETING EVERY SINGLE YEAR IN THE

[Captioner] 22:57:34

GENERAL FUND ON A PAY AS YOU GO BASIS.


[Captioner] 22:57:37
SO WE'RE BASICALLY CASHING PEOPLE

[Captioner] 22:57:41
 OUT IN
THE CURRENT PRACTICE.
AND WHAT WE

[Captioner] 22:57:44
 REALLY WANT TO BE DOING IS
SETTING ASIDE FUNDS THAT WE

[Captioner] 22:57:48
 CAN THEN
CASH PEOPLE OUT OF

[Captioner] 22:57:51
 AND THE SMALLER
AMOUNT EACH YEAR THAT REPRESENTS

[Captioner] 22:57:54
 THE
EARNED BUT UNUSED LEAVE WOULD THEN

[Captioner] 22:57:57
 GET
TRANSFERRED.
SO THE OPERATING FUNDS WOULD ACTUALLY


[Captioner] 22:58:01
SAVE MONEY ON AN ANNUAL BASIS.


[Captioner] 22:58:06
>> RIGHT.
AND THEN THAT LEAVE IS CAPPED, THOUGH,


[Captioner] 22:58:09
SO FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOU COULD ONLY EARN
200 HOURS

[Captioner] 22:58:12
 AND YOU HAVE 200 HOURS ON THE
BOOKS,

[Captioner] 22:58:15
 YOU CAN'T EARN ANY MORING?
>> Mr. Persselin: THAT'S

[Captioner] 22:58:19
 CORRECT, YOU
CAN'T EARN

[Captioner] 22:58:22
 ANY MORE BUT AGAIN IF YOU --

[Captioner] 22:58:23

IN YOUR FIRST FEW YEARS OF SERVICE WITH


[Captioner] 22:58:26
THE CITY, THEN YOU HAVE A 25-YEAR
CAREER, WHEN YOU CASH OUT,

[Captioner] 22:58:30
 THOSE 200
HOURS WILL GET CASHED OUT AT WHATEVER

[Captioner] 22:58:33

YOUR ENDING PAY WAS.
SO THE VALUE

[Captioner] 22:58:37
 INCREASES ON A
COMPOUNDED

[Captioner] 22:58:41
 BASIS.
>> Councilmember Campbell: OKAY.
SO BASED ON THE RECOMMENDATION OF

[Captioner] 22:58:44
 THESE
THREE THINGS, IT'S ABOUT

[Captioner] 22:58:48
 $43.2 MILLION
OUT OF THE 75 --

[Captioner] 22:58:53
 74.5, AND SO YOU'RE
RECOMMENDING A LITTLE OVER $30 MILLION


[Captioner] 22:58:56
TO COME BACK TO US AS

[Captioner] 22:58:59
 PERHAPS GOING INTO
THE UN

[Captioner] 22:59:03
 UNCERTAINTY?
>> Mr. Persselin: WE'RE NOT MAKING A

[Captioner] 22:59:07

RECOMMENDATION ABOUT THE BUDGET
UNCERTAINTY RESERVE RIGHT NOW WE'RE

[Captioner] 22:59:08

GOING TO WAIT UNTIL WE HAVE MORE
INFORMATION.


[Captioner] 22:59:12
AS I ALLUDED TO IN THE STAFF REPORT, WE
WILL BE COMING BACK LATER IN

[Captioner] 22:59:14
 THE YEAR
WITH THE FISCAL YEAR, SO WITHIN THE NEXT


[Captioner] 22:59:18
FEW MONTHS, WITH A RECOMMENDATION
RELATED TO

[Captioner] 22:59:21
 USING A PORTION TO PRE-PAY OR
TO

[Captioner] 22:59:24
 ESSENTIALLY PAY OFF A PORTION OF THE
CITY'S DEBT.
THAT WILL

[Captioner] 22:59:28
 PROBABLY BE SOMEWHERE IN THE
BALLPARK OF $17 MILLION.


[Captioner] 22:59:31
>> Councilmember Campbell: BUT YOU
HAVE $30 MILLION TO PLAY WITH?
>> Mr. Persselin: THAT'S

[Captioner] 22:59:33
 CORRECT.
AND I'M DEFINITELY NOT PLAYING WITH IT.


[Captioner] 22:59:37
>> Councilmember Campbell: WELL, NOT
LITERALLY.
THAT WAS FIGURATIVELY.


[Captioner] 22:59:42
>> Mr. Persselin: I UNDERSTAND.
>> Councilmember Campbell: SO

[Captioner] 22:59:46
 ABOUT
THAT IN THE STAFF REPORT, BECAUSE THAT

[Captioner] 22:59:48

WAS ONE OF MY QUESTIONS ABOUT THE BOND,


[Captioner] 22:59:51
DO WE NOT HAVE A SEPARATE

[Captioner] 22:59:54
 FUND THAT
DEALS SPECIFICALLY WITH BOND DOLLARS?


[Captioner] 22:59:58
>> Mr. Persselin: SO THE CITY

[Captioner] 23:00:02
 OF
FREMONT, IN THE PAST, HAS ISSUED BONDS

[Captioner] 23:00:05

TO PAY FOR PROJECTS.


[Captioner] 23:00:09
WE HAVE PAID FOR ALL THOSE PROJECTS.
WE HAVE

[Captioner] 23:00:12
 NO MORE BOND MONEY.
WE

[Captioner] 23:00:15
 ARE PAYING DEBT SERVICE ON THOSE

[Captioner] 23:00:18

BONDS, SO WE DO HAVE DEBT

[Captioner] 23:00:20
 SERVICE FUNDS
THAT WE USE FOR PAYING PRINCIPAL AND
INTEREST.


[Captioner] 23:00:24
BUT WE HAVE NO MORE BOND MONEY TO
SPEND.


[Captioner] 23:00:29
>> Councilmember Campbell: BUT DIDN'T
WE EARN INTEREST ON THOSE BONDS SO THAT

[Captioner] 23:00:33

YOU HAVE AN INTEREST ACCOUNT TO BE ABLE

[Captioner] 23:00:36

TO PAY THAT DEBT

[Captioner] 23:00:39
 ON?
>> Mr. Persselin: SO WHEN WE ISSUE

[Captioner] 23:00:43

BONDS, WE RECEIVE THE MONEY AND PUT IT


[Captioner] 23:00:45
IN A BOND PROJECT FUND THAT

[Captioner] 23:00:47
 IS
SEGREGATED FROM ALL OF OUR OTHER FUNDS


[Captioner] 23:00:51
BECAUSE IT HAS TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR
SEPARATELY.


[Captioner] 23:00:55
EARNINGS, INTEREST EARNINGS ON THOSE
BOND

[Captioner] 23:00:58
 PROCEEDS ARE CONSIDERED TO BE BOND
PROCEEDS

[Captioner] 23:01:07
 SO THEY HAVE TO BE

[Captioner] 23:01:10
 USED FOR THE 
PURPOSE.
WE DID

[Captioner] 23:01:13
 EARN INTEREST, BUT THOSE 
INTEREST EARNINGS

[Captioner] 23:01:16
 WERE ALSO 
SPENT ON THOSE PROJECTS.
SO ALL OF THAT MONEY IS

[Captioner] 23:01:21
 GONE IT 
MAY BE

[Captioner] 23:01:26
 THAT YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH 
WHAT'S KNOWN AS A DEBT

[Captioner] 23:01:29
 SERVICE 
RESERVE FUND.
SO FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF

[Captioner] 23:01:32
 BOND 
ISSUANCE, LIKE FOR EXAMPLE, WE

[Captioner] 23:01:35
 
HAVE TWO COMMUNITY FACILITIES 
DISTRICTS, FOR WHICH

[Captioner] 23:01:38
 WE HAVE 
ISSUED BONDS

[Captioner] 23:01:41
.

[Captioner] 23:01:46

THOSE BONDS WERE ISSUED, OR 
THOSE BOND

[Captioner] 23:01:49
 PROCEEDS WERE USED 
NOT ONLY TO PAY FOR THE PROJECT,

[Captioner] 23:01:52

PROJECTS, BUT ALSO TO FUND

[Captioner] 23:01:56
 WHAT 
IS CALLED THE DEBT SERVICE 
RESERVE FUND AND THAT

[Captioner] 23:01:59
 DEBT 
SERVICE RESERVE FUND IS 
BASICALLY SECURITY FOR

[Captioner] 23:02:02
 BOND 
HOLDERS, IF IN FACT

[Captioner] 23:02:05
 THERE IS 
PROBLEM WITH REPAYMENT IN THE 
FUTURE THERE IS MONEYS SITTING 


[Captioner] 23:02:09
WITH A BOND TRUSTEE, A FISCAL 
AGENT, A BANK

[Captioner] 23:02:12
 IN THE DEBT 
SERVICE RESERVE FUND THAT CAN BE 
USED

[Captioner] 23:02:15
 TO PAY DEBT SERVICE.
SO I THINK THAT MIGHT BE

[Captioner] 23:02:18
 WHAT 
YOU'RE ALLUDING TO.
WHEN WE ISSUE

[Captioner] 23:02:21
 GENERAL OBLIGATION 
BONDS OR WHEN WE ISSUE LEASE 
REVENUE

[Captioner] 23:02:25
 BONDS WE DON'T ACTUALLY 
HAVE A DEBT SERVICE RESERVE FUND 
SO

[Captioner] 23:02:28
 WE DON'T HAVE THAT KIND OF 
MONEY.
>> Councilmember Campbell:   AND 


[Captioner] 23:02:31
SO THEREFORE, YOU HAVE TO PAY 
THE DEBT OUT OF THE GENERAL FUND

[Captioner] 23:02:35

FUND?


[Captioner] 23:02:39
>> FOR OUR BONDS

[Captioner] 23:02:42
 WHERE THE 
VOTERS VOTED

[Captioner] 23:02:45
 TO INCREASE THEIR 
PROPERTY TAX, THOSE PROPERTY TAX

[Captioner] 23:02:49
 
DOLLARS ARE USED TO PAY GENERAL

[Captioner] 23:02:52
 
OBLIGATION BONDS BUT AS YOU SAID 
FOR THE LEASE REVENUE BONDS 


[Captioner] 23:02:55
THOSE ARE PAID FROM ULTIMATELY 
THE GENERAL FUND

[Captioner] 23:02:58
.
>> Councilmember Campbell:   SO 
THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT KINDS.


[Captioner] 23:03:03
>> David Persselin:   CORRECT.
>> Councilmember Campbell:   
THANK YOU SO MUCH.


[Captioner] 23:03:06
THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei:   NEXT QUESTIONS 
FROM

[Captioner] 23:03:09
 VICE MAYOR KENG.
>> Vice Mayor Keng:   THANK YOU 
MADAM MAYOR

[Captioner] 23:03:12
 AND THANK YOU VERY 
MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION AND 
UPDATE.


[Captioner] 23:03:15
SO I JUST DID SOME QUICK MATH 
HERE.

[Captioner] 23:03:18

SO OUR ESTIMATE OF --

[Captioner] 23:03:22
 ESTIMATES 
OF INCREASE OF

[Captioner] 23:03:25
 ONE TWO THREE 
FOUR INCOME SOURCES TOTALED

[Captioner] 23:03:29
 
ABOUT $54 MUCH 6

[Captioner] 23:03:32
 MILLION IS THAT 
ALL OF THE INCREASE RIGHT

[Captioner] 23:03:36
?
>> David Persselin:   YES.
>> Vice Mayor Keng:   AND FROM

[Captioner] 23:03:39
 
THAT WE'RE HOPING TO APPROVE A 
TRANSFER OF 43

[Captioner] 23:03:42
.5 MILLION OF THAT 
ESTIMATE?
>> David Persselin:   CORRECT

[Captioner] 23:03:46
.
>> Vice Mayor Keng:   SO IT'S 
ABOUT AN

[Captioner] 23:03:50
 80%-ISH OF THAT 
ESTIMATE OF INCREASE THAT

[Captioner] 23:03:53
 WE'RE 
TRYING TO ALLOCATE RIGHT NOW?
>> David Persselin:  

[Captioner] 23:03:56
 THAT 
SOUNDS ABOUT RIGHT.
>> Vice Mayor Keng:   SO IS 


[Captioner] 23:03:59
THERE -- ARE WE GOING TO DO LIKE 
A -- BECAUSE WE'RE DOING

[Captioner] 23:04:02
 LIKE A 
WHOLE TRANSFER RIGHT NOW

[Captioner] 23:04:06
.
AND SO IS THE TRANSFER HAPPENING 
RIGHT NOW

[Captioner] 23:04:10
, BEFORE WE HAVE -- 
BEFORE

[Captioner] 23:04:13
 WE REALIZE ALL OF THESE 
TAXES, OR WHEN IS

[Captioner] 23:04:16
 THAT TAKING 
PLACE?
>> David Persselin:   SO AS I 


[Captioner] 23:04:19
ALLUDED TO EARLIER,

[Captioner] 23:04:22
 WE'VE 
ALREADY RECEIVED $27 MILLION 
MORE THAN WE HAD

[Captioner] 23:04:26
 ANTICIPATED 
ALONE IN JUST THE SALES TAMP 
REVENUE

[Captioner] 23:04:30
 TAX 
REVENUE.
THE $13 MILLION

[Captioner] 23:04:33
 IN EXPENDITURE 
SAVINGS THAT WE ARE ANTICIPATING

[Captioner] 23:04:36
 
WE'RE FAR ENOUGH ALONG IN THE 
FISCAL YEAR NOW

[Captioner] 23:04:40
 THAT THAT'S 
GOING TO BE PRETTY CLOSE TO WHAT 
WE SEE.


[Captioner] 23:04:45
AND THE OTHER ITEMS THAT WE

[Captioner] 23:04:48
 
TALKED ABOUT, THE PROPERTY TAX 
AND THE

[Captioner] 23:04:51
 HOTEL TAX, THOSE WE'RE

[Captioner] 23:04:54
 
FEELING PRETTY CONFIDENT ABOUT 
AS WELL.


[Captioner] 23:04:57
SO, YOU KNOW, AND AS I ALLUDED 
TO

[Captioner] 23:05:00
 THAT STILL LEAVES 
APPROXIMATELY 30 SOMETHING

[Captioner] 23:05:03
 
MILLION DOLLARS TODAY THAT WOULD 
STILL BE UNALLOCATED

[Captioner] 23:05:07
.
SO WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO ABSORB

[Captioner] 23:05:10
 
SOME RISK IF FOR SOME REASON 
EITHER WE WERE

[Captioner] 23:05:13
 VERY FORTUNATE 
AND WERE ABLE TO FILL A LOT OF 
VACANCY

[Captioner] 23:05:16
IES REAL QUICKLY OR 
ALTERNATIVELILY

[Captioner] 23:05:19
 IF REVENUES 
DROPPED.
>> Vice Mayor Keng:   THANK YOU 


[Captioner] 23:05:23
FOR THAT CLARIFICATION.
I THINK THAT THE GET

[Captioner] 23:05:26
TING MORE 
CLARITY WHEN WE'RE APPROVING 
THIS DECISION.

[Captioner] 23:05:28

THANK YOU.
>> David Persselin:   YES, THE 


[Captioner] 23:05:31
OTHER THING I WOULD NOTE IS THAT 
YOU MAY RECALL WHEN

[Captioner] 23:05:34
 WE ADOPTED 
THE BUDGET WE, BECAUSE OF ALL 
THE UNCERTAINTY

[Captioner] 23:05:37
 WE WERE FACING 
AT THAT TIME, INCLUDING LABOR 
NEGOTIATIONS,

[Captioner] 23:05:41
 WE ACTUALLY KEPT 
ABOUT $21

[Captioner] 23:05:44
 MILLION AS 
UNALLOCATED, UNRESERVED

[Captioner] 23:05:47
 FUND 
BALANCE, IN THE ADOPTED BUDGET

[Captioner] 23:05:51
.
THAT AMOUNT HAS DROPPED TO 
AROUND $17

[Captioner] 23:05:54
 MILLION, IN LARGE 
PART BECAUSE OF

[Captioner] 23:05:57
 THE ADJUSTMENTS 
DUE TO THE LABOR AGREEMENTS.

[Captioner] 23:06:00

SO THAT $17 MILLION IS ALSO PART

[Captioner] 23:06:03
 
OF THAT PROJECTED ENDING $74

[Captioner] 23:06:06
.5 
MILLION THAT YOU SEE.
SO WE KNOW WE HAVE

[Captioner] 23:06:10
 THAT IN THE 
BANK AS WELL.


[Captioner] 23:06:13
>> Vice Mayor Keng:   SOUNDS 
GOOD, THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei:  

[Captioner] 23:06:16
 THANK YOU.
NEXT IS COUNCILMEMBER COX.


[Captioner] 23:06:22
>> Councilmember Cox:   THANK 
YOU.


[Captioner] 23:06:25
WELL, IT'S GETTING LATE AND I 
JUST HAD ONE SIMPLE QUESTION

[Captioner] 23:06:28
.
AND I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR 
DETAIL,

[Captioner] 23:06:31
 YOU JUST ROLL IT AND DO 
IT SO WELL WITH THE

[Captioner] 23:06:34
 NUMBERS AND 
MAKING SURE THAT WE

[Captioner] 23:06:39
 ARE FISCAL 
RESPONSIBLE AND

[Captioner] 23:06:42
 ALSO 
TRANSPARENT.
IN LIGHT OF THE WEATHER, I KNOW

[Captioner] 23:06:45
 
THAT WITH THE DIRECTION OF THE 
CITY COUNCIL TO THE

[Captioner] 23:06:49
 CITY MANAGER 
TO HAVE AN EMERGENCY ORDERS

[Captioner] 23:06:52
 FOR 
THE STORMS HAD A WE'VE BEEN 
EXPERIENCING

[Captioner] 23:06:56
, IS THERE ANY WORD 
YET ON

[Captioner] 23:06:59
 FUNDING COMING TO US, TO 
REIMBURSE US FOR ANY OF

[Captioner] 23:07:02
 THE 
STORM DAMAGE THAT WE'VE 
EXPERIENCED IN THE

[Captioner] 23:07:06
 CITY?
AND I KNOW WE'RE STILL GETTING 
E-MAILS ABOUT POTHOLES

[Captioner] 23:07:09
 AND 
THINGS IN THE ROAD THAT STILL 
NEED

[Captioner] 23:07:12
 TO BE REPAIRED AND TREES 
DOWN.
IS THERE ANY

[Captioner] 23:07:16
 CONSIDERATION YOU 
HAD TO THAT

[Captioner] 23:07:20
?
>> David Persselin:   YES, SO WE 
KNOW THAT BECAUSE THERE WAS

[Captioner] 23:07:23
 AN 
EMERGENCY DECLARED BOTH AT THE 
FEDERAL

[Captioner] 23:07:26
 LEVEL AND AT THE STATE 
LEVEL, THAT THERE ARE FEMA

[Captioner] 23:07:30
 FUNDS 
AVAILABLE TO REIMBURSE THE CITY 
FOR COSTS THAT

[Captioner] 23:07:33
 WE INCURRED FOR, 
YOU KNOW,

[Captioner] 23:07:37
 BOTH REPAIRING DAMAGE 
CAUSED BY THE WEATHER

[Captioner] 23:07:42
 AS WELL AS 
SOME OF THE OTHER COSTS THAT WE 
HAD TO INCUR

[Captioner] 23:07:45
 TO ASSIST MEMBERS

[Captioner] 23:07:48
 
OF THE COMMUNITY.
OUR EMERGENCY SERVICES MANAGER 


[Captioner] 23:07:51
IS WORKING WITH SOME OF MY STAFF 
AND THEN STAFF

[Captioner] 23:07:54
 FROM THE 
DEPARTMENTS THAT RESPONDED 
AROUND THE CITY TO

[Captioner] 23:07:59
 COLLECT 
EXPENDITURE INFORMATION AND 
WE'LL BE PUTTING

[Captioner] 23:08:02
 TOGETHER A 
REIMBURSEMENT REQUEST TO

[Captioner] 23:08:06
 FEMA 
SIMILAR TO THE REQUESTS THAT WE 
PUT FORWARD AFTER COVID

[Captioner] 23:08:09
.
SO WE DO ANTICIPATE THAT AT 
LEAST SOME PORTION OF

[Captioner] 23:08:12
 WHAT WE'VE 
SPENT WILL BE REIMBURSED

[Captioner] 23:08:16
.
>> Councilmember Cox:   OKAY BUT 
THERE'S NOT REALLY A

[Captioner] 23:08:19
 TIME LINE 
JUST YET, SINCE IT'S JUST KIND 
OF GATHERING

[Captioner] 23:08:22
 THE INFORMATION 
NOW, AND WE KNOW THE BUDGET 
ALWAYS KIND OF

[Captioner] 23:08:25
 TAKES PLACE THAT 
LAST MONTH, IN JUNE.
SO IT WOULD BE

[Captioner] 23:08:29
 SOMETIME PROBABLY 
AFTER JUNE I WOULD ANTICIPATE 
GETTING THE

[Captioner] 23:08:33
 REIMBURSEMENT.
IS THAT

[Captioner] 23:08:36
 --
>> David Persselin:   YES, I 
WOULD ANTICIPATE IT WOULD BE A

[Captioner] 23:08:39
 
WHILE, GIVEN THAT FEMA IS 
WORKING THROUGH ITS

[Captioner] 23:08:42
 COVID 
BACKLOG.
I KNOW THAT WE'RE STILL GETTING 


[Captioner] 23:08:46
THE WAY FEMA WORKS IS YOU SUBMIT 
YOUR

[Captioner] 23:08:49
 REIMBURSEMENT REQUEST, AND 
THEN FEMA

[Captioner] 23:08:52
 STAFF START REVIEWING 
THE REQUEST AND THEY COME BACK 
AND ASK

[Captioner] 23:08:55
 FOR CLARIFICATION OR FOR 
MORE DETAIL OR MORE

[Captioner] 23:08:58
 
DOCUMENTATION.
SO FOR EXAMPLE, I'M STILL 


[Captioner] 23:09:01
RESPONDING TO REQUESTS FOR 
INFORMATION, I JUST RESPONDED TO 
ONE

[Captioner] 23:09:05
 LAST WEEK, ON OUR COVID 
REIMBURSEMENT

[Captioner] 23:09:08
.
SO I SUSPECT IT WILL BE A FAIRLY 
LENGTHY PROCESS

[Captioner] 23:09:11
.
>> Councilmember Cox:   OKAY, 
AND I KNOW THAT

[Captioner] 23:09:15
 WITH THE 
RESERVES WE HAVE MORE THAN 
ENOUGH TO COVER US UNTIL THE

[Captioner] 23:09:20
 
REIMBURSEMENT CHECKS COME BACK 
IN.

[Captioner] 23:09:22

>> David Persselin:   THAT'S 
CORRECT.


[Captioner] 23:09:24
>> Councilmember Cox:   THANK 
YOU VERY MUCH.
I'M READY TO MAKE A MOTION.


[Captioner] 23:09:27
I'D LIKE TO MOVE TO ACCEPT 
THE -- WHAT IS THIS, THE

[Captioner] 23:09:30
 
PROPOSED, THE MID YEAR 2022-20

[Captioner] 23:09:34
23 

[Captioner] 23:09:38
 
PHYSICAL YEAR BUDGET REPORT, 
ACCEPTED.

[Captioner] 23:09:41

AND STAFF RECOMMENDATION.

[Captioner] 23:09:45

>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado:   WE 
HAVE TO STILT SEE IF THERE ARE 


[Captioner] 23:09:48
ANY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC THAT 
WOULD LIKE TO COMMENT

[Captioner] 23:09:52
.
>> Mayor Mei:   THAT'S WHAT I 
WAS

[Captioner] 23:09:55
 -- DO WE HAVE ANY SPEAKERS?
THAT'S OKAY

[Captioner] 23:09:59
, I WANT SPEAKERS, 
WHO ARE IN THE ROOM

[Captioner] 23:10:02
 OR THOSE WHO 
ARE ON ZOOM TO WANT TO ADDRESS

[Captioner] 23:10:05
 
THE MID YEAR BUDGET TO EITHER DO 
SO BY PRESSING THE

[Captioner] 23:10:09
 RAISE HAND 
ICON OR DIALING STAR 9

[Captioner] 23:10:13
.
CNLT

[Captioner] 23:10:17
>> Alberto Quintanilla:   WE DO 
HAVE ONE SPEAKER ON ZOOM

[Captioner] 23:10:19
.
H LEANG.
>> GOOD EVENING.


[Captioner] 23:10:23
I HAVE A QUICK QUESTION TO 
FOLLOW UP

[Captioner] 23:10:26
 ONE ITEM.
THIS CITY COUNCIL MAYBE RECALL

[Captioner] 23:10:29
, 
YOU STARTED TWO

[Captioner] 23:10:33
 RED LIGHT CAMERA 
AT AUTO MALL INTERSECTION

[Captioner] 23:10:36
, THE 
DECISION WAS CONTROVERSIAL AND 
AT THAT TIME

[Captioner] 23:10:39
, THE MERCURY NEWS

[Captioner] 23:10:42
, 
RIGHT WHEN YOU EXPAND FOR THAT

[Captioner] 23:10:46
 
RED LIGHT CAMERA IS

[Captioner] 23:10:49
 $1.1 
MILLION.
AND

[Captioner] 23:10:52
 BASED ON MY SIMPLE LEAN YEAR 
EXPLANATION WE

[Captioner] 23:10:56
 HAVE 12 CAMERA, 
IS WORK OUT ROUGHLY ABOUT $5

[Captioner] 23:10:59
 
MILLION AND UNFORTUNATELY I 
CANNOT

[Captioner] 23:11:02
 FIND THIS NUMBER FROM 
FISCAL YEAR 22-

[Captioner] 23:11:06
23 BREAKDOWN.
SO JUST FOR MY OWN KIND OF

[Captioner] 23:11:09
 
CURIOSITY, IS HOW ACTUALLY

[Captioner] 23:11:12
 THE 
RED LIGHT CAMERA IMPACT THE

[Captioner] 23:11:15
 CITY 
REVENUE.
YOU CAN SEE ON

[Captioner] 23:11:19
 THE ONE SPECK 
THRUM LIKE

[Captioner] 23:11:22
 HAYWARD, AND BECAUSE 
THIS IS

[Captioner] 23:11:26
 A PROGRAM THEY ACTUALLY 
REMOVE THE CAMERA BUT YOU

[Captioner] 23:11:29
 CAN 
ALSO SEE ACTUALLY SOME COMMENTS 
FROM THE PUBLIC.


[Captioner] 23:11:32
THIS IS KIND OF A

[Captioner] 23:11:36
 WRAP AROUND 
PROGRAM SO I AM CURIOUS

[Captioner] 23:11:39
 TO 
ACTUALLY KNOW WHAT KIND OF 
REVENUE WE ARE TAKING FROM THE

[Captioner] 23:11:41
 
RED LIGHT CAMERA.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 23:11:44
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.
IS THAT THE ONLY SPEAKER WE HAVE

[Captioner] 23:11:47
 
THIS EVENING?
>> Alberto Quintanilla:   NO 


[Captioner] 23:11:51
OTHER SPEAKERS.
>> Mayor Mei:   I'M NOT SURE 
THAT

[Captioner] 23:11:55
 DIRECTOR PERSSELIN HAS THAT

[Captioner] 23:11:58
 
FIGURE.
IT'S ALSO THE IMPACT AND

[Captioner] 23:12:02
 I DON'T 
THINK UNFORTUNATELY THIS EVENING 
WE HAVE CHIEF WASHINGTON

[Captioner] 23:12:05
 ABLE TO 
ANSWER SOME OF THE IMPACTS THAT 
ARE ABLE TO

[Captioner] 23:12:11
, I'M NOT SURE YOU 
DELVED

[Captioner] 23:12:14
 DOWN TO THAT LEVEL, I 
KNOW WHEN WE GO THROUGH

[Captioner] 23:12:18
 OUR 
CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS AND OUR 
OVERALL BUDGET NEXT COUPLE

[Captioner] 23:12:20
 OF 
MONTHS WE WILL HAVE THIS 
CONVERSATION.


[Captioner] 23:12:24
>> WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE 
PROPOSED BUDGET WE DO GET DOWN

[Captioner] 23:12:27
 
INTO THE DETAIL OF WHAT SOME OF 
THE COMPONENTS ARE

[Captioner] 23:12:30
.
BUT I WOS EMPHASIZE THAT THE RED

[Captioner] 23:12:34
 
LIGHT CAMERA PROGRAM IS 
PRIMARILY

[Captioner] 23:12:37
 FOR PUBLIC SAFETY 
SERVICES.
IT IS NOT PRIMARILY FOR

[Captioner] 23:12:39
 REVENUE 
PURPOSES.
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 23:12:43
I'LL REALLY QUICKLY GO THROUGH 
MY COMMENTS

[Captioner] 23:12:45
.
I WANTED TO SAY THANK YOU FOR 
THIS REPORT.


[Captioner] 23:12:48
I THINK IT'S BEEN VERY 
IMPORTANT.
I KNOW PEOPLE WHEN WE DID

[Captioner] 23:12:52
 OUR 
BUDGET A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO, 
BECAUSE OF THE AMOUNT OF

[Captioner] 23:12:55
 SALES 
TAX THAT WE GOT FOR AUTO SALES, 
WE WERE

[Captioner] 23:12:58
 WORRIED ABOUT THE 
DECLINE AND SO THEREFORE WE HAD

[Captioner] 23:13:01
 
PUT TOGETHER SOME MORE FUNDING 
INTO THE UNANTICIPATED

[Captioner] 23:13:05
 IMPACT.
AND BECAUSE WE'VE HAD THE 
PRUDENT THOUGHT PROCESS

[Captioner] 23:13:08
 OF 
KEEPING TWO LINES OF BUDGET SET 
ASIDE FOR THIS

[Captioner] 23:13:11
, IT HELPED US 
TREMENDOUSLY WHEN WE HIT THE 
COVID

[Captioner] 23:13:14
 AND DIDN'T HAVE TO CUT THE 
SERVICES NEARLY AS DEEP AS WE

[Captioner] 23:13:17
 
THOUGHT WE MIGHT HAVE TO.
I ALSO APPRECIATE

[Captioner] 23:13:20
 THE QUESTION 
FROM COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL, 
REGARDING

[Captioner] 23:13:24
 THE ARPA FUNDS AND HOW 
WE'VE

[Captioner] 23:13:27
 BEEN UTILIZING THESE LAST 
COUPLE OF YEARS TO BACKFILL THE

[Captioner] 23:13:30
 
CRITICAL SERVICES.
I'D LIKE TO PUBLIC TO

[Captioner] 23:13:33
 KNOW IT'S 
IMPORTANT FOR US TO PUT ASIDE 
AND WIED

[Captioner] 23:13:36
 MADE SOME TRUE

[Captioner] 23:13:40
 SERVICES 
THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS, FOR 
LIABILITY

[Captioner] 23:13:43
, I BELIEVE IF I'M 
CORRECT FOR THE $10 MILLION

[Captioner] 23:13:46
 WE 
SET ASIDE WE'RE SAVING

[Captioner] 23:13:50
 $1 
MILLION A YEAR IS THAT CORRECT

[Captioner] 23:13:53
?
>> David Persselin:   THAT'S 
CORRECT, THE $10 MILLION WE MADE

[Captioner] 23:13:56
 
ADDITIONALLY FOR EMPLOYEE HEALTH 
CARE,

[Captioner] 23:13:59
 IS RESULTING IN 
APPROXIMATELY $1 MILLION A

[Captioner] 23:14:02
 YEAR 
SAVINGS GOING FORWARD.
>> Mayor Mei:   AND THAT'S KIND 


[Captioner] 23:14:05
OF WHAT THE THOUGHT PROCESS IS 
FROM THE DISCUSSION OF DOING THE

[Captioner] 23:14:09
 
EMPLOYEE BENEFITS THAT WE DIDN'T 
HAVE AS WE PUT TOGETHER THE

[Captioner] 23:14:12
 
BUDGET LAST TIME, WE DIDN'T PUT 
TOGETHER FULLY THE IMPACT

[Captioner] 23:14:15
 OF THE 
INCREASE OF THE SALARIES AND AS 
WE TALKED ABOUT THE LEAVE THAT'S 


[Captioner] 23:14:18
GOING TO HELP US OFFSET THAT.
I THINK THAT

[Captioner] 23:14:21
 THE RISK MANAGEMENT 
OBVIOUSLY FOR DIFFERENT REASONS 
THAT

[Captioner] 23:14:24
 WE DO NEED TO BACKFILL

[Captioner] 23:14:28
 THAT 
JUST TO BE PRUDENT AND FOR THE 
CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM

[Captioner] 23:14:30
 
HEARING FROM OUR RESIDENTS 
THERE'S NO SHORTAGE OF THINGS 


[Captioner] 23:14:33
THAT NEED TO BE FIXED.
AND I KNOW THAT WE DO GET AN 
UPDATE

[Captioner] 23:14:37
 EVERY YEAR FOR THE PCI 
WHICH IS THE

[Captioner] 23:14:40
 PAVEMENT INDEX AND 
IT'S HARD BECAUSE WHEN WE 
COMPARE TO SO MANY

[Captioner] 23:14:43
 OTHER CITIES, 
BEING THE SECOND LARGEST IN LAND

[Captioner] 23:14:46
 
SIZE THE AMOUNT OF ROADS THAT WE 
HAVE TO IMPROVE AND THE

[Captioner] 23:14:49
 OTHER 
EFFORTS WE'RE PUTTING IN FOR 
SMART SIGNALING IN

[Captioner] 23:14:52
 OTHER AREAS 
FOR THE COMMUNITY, ESPECIALLY 
THINGS LIKE OUR SAFE

[Captioner] 23:14:56
 ROUTES TO 
SCHOOL IMPLEMENTING 500 CHANGES 
IN THE

[Captioner] 23:14:59
 LAST TWO YEARS I THINK OR 
COUPLE OF YEARS HAS

[Captioner] 23:15:02
 BEEN 
INCREDIBLY NEEDED.
SO I WOULD ENCOURAGE US TO 


[Captioner] 23:15:05
CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON, I KNOW 
THERE WILL BE NO SHORTAGE OF 
CONVERSATION

[Captioner] 23:15:08
S WHEN IT COMES TO 
CIP PROGRAM NEXT WEEK

[Captioner] 23:15:12
.
AND THEN FINALLY ALSO FOR THE

[Captioner] 23:15:15
 
VACANCIES, I KNOW THAT WE'VE RUN 
VERY LEAN BUT

[Captioner] 23:15:18
 WHAT WE'RE HEARING 
FROM THE PUBLIC AND I THINK IT'S 
SOMETHING THAT WE

[Captioner] 23:15:21
 DEMONSTRATE 
RIGHT NOW IF YOU LOOKED AT OUR 
POSTINGS

[Captioner] 23:15:24
 ON LINKED IN AND OTHER 
AREAS WE ARE TRYING

[Captioner] 23:15:27
 VERY 
ACTIVELY RIGHT NOW TO RECRUIT TO 
FILL THOSE POSITIONS

[Captioner] 23:15:31
 AND THAT IS 
MY GOAL.
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE US BE

[Captioner] 23:15:34
 ABLE 
TO SUPPORT THAT AND VACANCIES 
ARE THINGS WE SHOULD BE ABLE

[Captioner] 23:15:37
 TO 
TRY TO FILL, TO MAKE SURE WE GET 
THE SERVICE

[Captioner] 23:15:40
 AREAS.
SAFETY, PLANNING AND PERMITTING 
WE TALKED

[Captioner] 23:15:43
 THIS EVENING ABOUT HOW 
WE CAN HELP PEOPLE AND ONE OF 
THE AREAS IS TO

[Captioner] 23:15:46
 BUILD THE HOMES 
AND BUILD THE HOUSING

[Captioner] 23:15:49
 THAT'S 
NEEDED ESPECIALLY I KNOW IT'S 
BEEN CHALLENGING AT TIMES,

[Captioner] 23:15:53
 WE 
ALSO HAD SOME CONVERSATIONS WE 
LOOK AT FOR HOME

[Captioner] 23:15:56
LESSNESS AND 
OTHER RESOURCES AND PROGRAMS 
THAT WE CAN PUT

[Captioner] 23:15:59
 ASIDE FOR THAT, 
I'D BE VERY

[Captioner] 23:16:02
 SUPPORTIVE OF THAT.
IT'S NOT TO OPEN THE

[Captioner] 23:16:05
 PANDORA'S 
BOX ON THAT BUT WE

[Captioner] 23:16:09
 GET QUESTIONS 
ABOUT TREES AND SIDEWALKS AND 
THINGS LIKE

[Captioner] 23:16:12
 THAT, AGING AND SOME 
OF THOSE IMPACTS

[Captioner] 23:16:16
.
I SAW THAT WE HAD A MOTION AND I 
THINK WE HAVE A

[Captioner] 23:16:18
 SECOND FROM --
>> Councilmember Campbell:   
SECOND.


[Captioner] 23:16:23
>> Mayor Mei:   COUNCILMEMBER 
KENG.
>> Councilmember Campbell:   OH.


[Captioner] 23:16:26
>> Mayor Mei:   

[Captioner] 23:16:30
SHE WAS ALREADY ON 
THE DAIS.
SHE WAS

[Captioner] 23:16:32
 TRYING TO SECOND IT.
WE HAVE A MOTION AND SECOND.
CAN WE PLEASE VOTE.


[Captioner] 23:16:37
THANK YOU.
THE MOTION CARRIES UNANIMOUSLY.

[Captioner] 23:16:41

AND WE THANK ALL THE STAFF FOR 
THEIR HELP IN THIS AREA

[Captioner] 23:16:46
.

[Captioner] 23:16:51

AND IT'S I THINK THAT WHILE WE 
NORMALLY HAVE

[Captioner] 23:16:54
 AN UPDATE UNLESS 
SOMEBODY HAS SOMETHING

[Captioner] 23:16:57
 CRITICAL 
THAT THEY WANT TO SHARE FROM A 
COMMITTEE,

[Captioner] 23:17:01
 I SAY AT THIS TIME, 
WE THANK EVERYONE FOR JOINING

[Captioner] 23:17:04
 US 
THIS EVENING,

[Captioner] 23:17:07
 THE MEETING IS 
ADJOURNED
