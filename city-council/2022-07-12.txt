19:10:22 OF THE PAINTING TO CITY OF FREMONT BY COUNTRY CLUB OF WASHINGTON TOWNSHIP 
19:10:26 WOMEN'S CLUB BY MICHI YEE, WHO'S THE PRESIDENT.

19:10:28 AND I APPRECIATE HER JOINING US THIS EVENING.

19:10:37 AND I'VE HAD A WONDERFUL TIME MEETING WITH YOUR MEMBERS WHEN WE'RE ABLE TO

19:11:10 PAINTING WHICH ACCOMPLISHED WEST COAST ARTIST NANCY PRATT FROM THE COUNTRY 
19:11:12 CLUB OF WASHINGTON TOWNSHIP WOMEN’S CLUB. THE WATERCOLOR PORTRAYS THE 
19:11:13 HISTORICAL CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE CLUB AND ITS MEMBERS TO THE FREMONT 
19:11:16 COMMUNITY FOR MORE THAN 125 YEARS. THE COUNTRY CLUB OF WASHINGTON TOWNSHIP 
19:11:19 WOMEN’S CLUB FOUNDED IN 1896, PRIOR TO THE CITY OF FREMONT’S INCORPORATION, 
19:11:24 HAS PLAYED A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR COMMUNITY. FOUNDED 
19:11:25 WITH THE IDEA THAT WOMEN HAVE AN IMPORTANT AND PURPOSEFUL ROLE TO PLAY 
19:11:30 IN FURTHERING COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT AND ITS PROGRESS, CLUB MEMBERS HAVE BEEN 
19:11:33 UNITED IN THE PRINCIPLES OF UNITY IN DIVERSITY, TOGETHERNESS HELPFULNESS, 
19:11:40 LOGIC AND REASON AND SOCIAL JUSTICE. THE LARGE ART PIECE HIGHLIGHTS SOME OF 
19:11:43 THE MAJOR CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE CLUB INCLUDING THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS TO HOME 
19:11:49 LIFE, PUBLIC AFFAIRS, CREATIVE EXPRESSION, SUPPORT OF THE ARMED 
19:11:53 FORCES AND VETERANS, SECURING THE VOTE FOR WOMEN, INCORPORATION OF THE CITY 
19:11:58 OF FREMONT, CONSERVATION AND INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS. THE CITY 
19:12:03 ACKNOWLEDGES AND ACCEPTS THIS PAINTING AND THANKS THE COUNTRY CLUB OF 
19:12:07 WASHINGTON TOWNSHIP WOMEN’S CLUB FOR THE SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTIONS THEY 
19:12:09 HAVE MADE TO THE WELFARE OF LOCAL RESIDENTS OF ALL AGES. IN 
19:12:12 ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF THE SIGNIFICANT ROLE MEMBERS OF THIS CLUB HAVE PLAYED IN 
19:12:19 THE AREA OF HEALTH AND WELFARE WHICH INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING:  ESTABLISHING 
19:12:24 THE FIRST RED CROSS FOR WASHINGTON TOWNSHIP IN 1898  INITIATING MEETINGS 
19:12:27 IN 1946, AND BOND DRIVES TO ESTABLISH A HOSPITAL, WHICH CULMINATED IN THE 
19:12:35 OPENING OF WASHINGTON HOSPITAL IN 1958 AND IN ESTABLISHING THE “PINK LADIES 
19:12:38 LEAGUE AT WASHINGTON HOSPITAL WHICH HAVE PROVIDED THOUSANDS OF HOURS OF 
19:12:42 VOLUNTEER SERVICE AND FUNDRAISING SUPPORT. WASHINGTON HOSPITAL HAS 
19:12:48 OFFERED TO HOST AND DISPLAY THE PAINTING IN THE VOLUNTEER SERVICE AREA 
19:12:55 OF THE HOSPITAL. IN THIS SPACE, IT WILL SERVE AS BOTH A HISTORICAL REMINDER OF 
19:12:58 THE 125+ YEARS OF SERVICE PROVIDED BY THE COUNTRY CLUB OF WASHINGTON 
19:13:01 TOWNSHIP WOMEN’S CLUB AND AS AN INSPIRATION TO VOLUNTEERS OF THE 
19:13:09 FUTURE.SO I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE MICHI, I SEE HER WITH HER FABULOUS HAT, AND IF 
19:13:13 YOU COULD UNMUTE THE MIC, THAT WOULD BE WONDERFUL IF YOU COULD SHARE A FEW 
19:13:13 WORDS ON THIS.

19:13:13 THANK YOU.

19:13:26 HI, MICHI, I'M SORRY, YOU'RE STILL ON MUTE.

19:13:42 I APOLOGIZE, MICHI, I DON'T KNOW IF WE CAN UNMUTE HER ON THIS SIDE?

19:13:47 I SEE ALSO ANGUS COCHRAN FROM WASHINGTON HOSPITAL.

19:13:50 >> Ms. Gauthier: I'M SELECTING TO ASK HER TO UNMUTE BUT I CANNOT UNMUTE IT 
19:13:51 FOR HER.

19:13:54 >> Mayor Mei: RIGHT, THAT'S WHAT I WAS GOING TO SAY, I KNOW THAT, THAT'S THE 
19:13:55 ONLY THING YOU CAN ASK.

19:14:12 >> IS THAT THERE?

19:14:14 >> Mayor Mei: YES, THAT WORKS PERFECTLY NOW.

19:14:16 THANK YOU, MICHI.

19:14:18 >> WHAT ABOUT SUZANNE?

19:14:21 >> I'M HERE ALSO.

19:14:26 >> ARE YOU GOING TO SHOW THE PICTURE BY ANY CHANCE?

19:14:28 >> I HOPE SO.

19:14:32 >> DO I SPEAK FIRST OR DO YOU GO FIRST?

19:14:35 >> Ms. Gauthier: ALBERTO CAN SHARE THE PHOTO IF YOU'D LIKE TO SPEAK WHILE 
19:14:35 HE'S SHARING THAT.

19:14:39 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:14:46 >> I THINK EVERYTHING WAS WELL SAID AND DONE.

19:14:47 THANK YOU, SUZANNE.

19:14:54 YOU COVERED QUITE A BIT IN THE CEREMONIAL PRESENTATION SUMMARY.

19:14:59 ONE OF THE THINGS I'D LIKE TO ALSO MENTION WHICH MAY NOT HAVE PLAYED AN 
19:15:06 IMPORTANT PART IN THE PRESENTATION WAS THE FIRST CITY COUNCIL ELECTED A WOMAN 
19:15:12 NAMED WINIFRED MENDAL, AND ACCORDING TO THE HISTORY IN THE FIRST 30 YEARS OF 
19:15:18 FREMONT OR 50 YEARS, WHICHEVER IT WAS, THAT SHE  PLAYED A VERY IMPORTANT ROLE 
19:15:22 IN TRYING TO GET THE INFORMATION OUT TO THE COMMUNITY.

19:15:27 AS A MATTER OF FACT, IT QUOTES QUITE A NUMBER OF ARTICLES THAT SHE WROTE AND 
19:15:33 WAS ABLE TO, WITH THE HELP OF THE WOMEN AND OTHER ORGANIZATIONS, PUSH THROUGH 
19:15:35 TO GET THE CITY INCORPORATED IN 1956.

19:15:42 THAT, I THINK, WAS ALSO A VERY, VERY IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTION.

19:15:46 YOU SEE TODAY MANY WOMEN ON CITY COUNCIL, WHICH PRIOR TO THAT POINT IN 
19:15:53 TIME, WINIFRED MENDALL SERVED TWO YEARS AND LATER WAS OUTVOTED, 
19:15:53 UNFORTUNATELY.

19:16:04 BUT SHE WAS ALSO VERY INSTRUMENTAL AND -- THESE TWO BOOKS, THE HISTORY OF 
19:16:10 WASHINGTON TOWNSHIP RED BOOK AND GREEN EDITION WRITTEN IN 1950 AND 1960.

19:16:14 HARD BOUND COPIES OF LITERARY WORKS WHICH TODAY STILL STAND.

19:16:20 THEY ALSO BUILT A CLUBHOUSE IN 1914, WHICH STILL STANDS.

19:16:26 UNFORTUNATELY, UNABLE TO KEEP UP WITH THE MAINTENANCE AND THE RISING COSTS 
19:16:33 OF THINGS THAT GO WITH MAINTAINING A CLUBHOUSE, THEY BUILT THAT CLUBHOUSE 
19:16:36 FOR LESS THAN $3,000 IN 1914, IF YOU CAN BELIEVE THAT.

19:16:44 $800 FOR THE LOT, AND LESS THAN $2,000 FOR THE BUILDING MATERIALS AND THE 
19:16:44 BUILDERS.

19:16:46 I THINK THAT WAS QUITE AN ACCOMPLISHMENT.

19:16:57 UNKNOWNSTO ME AT THE TIME THAT I MOVED HERE IN 1964, DECEMBER OF '64, I WAS A 
19:17:04 YOUNG MOTHER, RAISING A FAMILY, AND NOT KNOWING WHAT TO EXPECT IN THE CITY OF 
19:17:07 FREMONT, JUST 10 YEARS AFTER ITS INCORPORATION.

19:17:14 LATER ON AS MY CHILDREN GREW UP, WE JOINED THE BOY SCOUTS, THE CAMPFIRE 
19:17:16 GIRLS, ET CETERA, ET CETERA, ET CETERA.

19:17:22 I TALKED TO A LOT OF OTHER PEOPLE AND THEY TELL ME THAT THE CLUBHOUSE OF 
19:17:26 WASHINGTON TOWNSHIP ON PARISH AVENUE WAS USED FOR NUMEROUS EVENTS.

19:17:32 BRIDAL SHOWERS, BABY SHOWERS, PARTIES, ENGAGEMENTS, DANCES, ET CETERA, ET 
19:17:32 CETERA.

19:17:39 1914 UNTIL 1993, WHEN THEY  FINALLY SOLD THE HOUSE.

19:17:40 OR CLUBHOUSE.

19:17:46 DURING THAT TIME, I WAS UNAWARE OF WHAT IT WAS ALL ABOUT.

19:17:50 CLUBS THAT REALLY INTERESTED ME AT THE TIME.

19:17:52 THEY WERE JUST SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE WENT TO.

19:18:00 LATER ON, I FOUND OUT THAT MY DAUGHTER BECAME A CAMPFIRE GIRL, BLUE BIRDS.

19:18:01 WE MET AT THE COUNTRY CLUB.

19:18:04 IT WAS JUST SOME PLACE TO GO MEET, BUT IT WAS THERE.

19:18:10 ABLE TO HELP US YOUNG MOTHERS AND CHILDREN GET US STARTED IN 
19:18:14 ORGANIZATIONS IN TOWN, LATER ON WHEN MY CHILDREN WERE OLD ENOUGH TO LEARN THE 
19:18:16 PIANO, THERE WAS A WOMAN NAME -- LET'S SEE, WHAT WAS HER NAME?

19:18:19 I FORGOT HER NAME, BUT SHE WAS QUITE A WOMAN.

19:18:23 SHE WAS AN ANTIQUE LADY.

19:18:29 WHEN I SAY ANTIQUE, SHE HELPED START THE ANTIQUE -- THE STUDY OF OLD THINGS 
19:18:32 RUN BY ROMA LACEY.

19:18:38 SHE WAS A PIANO TEACHER AND MY CHILDREN, BELIEVE IT OR NOT, DID THE 
19:18:41 PIANO RECITALS IN THAT LITTLE OLD COUNTRY CLUBHOUSE.

19:18:45 LATER ON WHEN I BECAME FREER, I WAS INVITED TO ATTEND THE CLUB MEETINGS 
19:18:48 AND WE MET THERE UNTIL SUCH TIME AS WHEN THEY SOLD IT.

19:18:53 BUT IT HAS -- THE CLUB HAS PLAYED AN IMPORTANT PART IN MY LIFE AS A NEW 
19:18:59 RESIDENT UNKNOWNST TO ME, AND FOR THAT, I'M VERY GRATEFUL FOR THE CITY FOR 
19:19:04 HAVING SUCH A HISTORY, I WOULD HATE TO SEE IT GO TO WASTE.

19:19:11 I WOULD HOPE THAT IN TIME, WE WOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE SOME SORT OF A -- A 
19:19:16 LARGER BUILDING THAT WE COULD HOUSE SUCH ARTIFACTS.

19:19:22 THE CLUBHOUSE STORED MANY FILES, SECRETARIAL NOTES FROM 1901, WHEN THEY 
19:19:28 FIRST STARTED, SIX OR SEVEN VOLUMES OF ALL THE YEARS KEPT IN A HANDWRITTEN 
19:19:30 SCRIPT IN A VOLUME, IN A LEDGER.

19:19:36 THEY WERE REPAIRED AND REBOUND AND THEY WERE PRESENTED TO THE COUNTY LIBRARY 
19:19:36 ON STEVENSON.

19:19:42 SO FOR THAT, WE WANT TO MAINTAIN GOOD RECORDS AND THE HISTORY OF FREMONT 
19:19:47 BEFORE IT BECAME FREMONT AS MUCH AS WE ARE ABLE TO.

19:19:53 TIME HAS WORKED ITS EFFECT ON ALL OUR MEMBERS.

19:19:59 OUR MOST RECENT PASSING WAS KATHRYN MIZETTI WHO SERVED OVER 67 YEARS AS A 
19:20:00 MEMBER OF THE ORGANIZATION.

19:20:07 HOW SHE USED TO GLEEFULLY WORK IN THE SHINN HOUSE SCRAPING THE PAINT OFF THE 
19:20:09 WALLS AND DOING ALL SUCH THINGS.

19:20:14 SO THAT'S WHY, YOU KNOW, IT'S BEEN SUCH A WONDERFUL THING TO BE ABLE TO BELONG 
19:20:19 TO AN ORGANIZATION THAT HAS DONE, I THINK, MANY, MANY GREAT THINGS.

19:20:25 THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT THE MURAL.

19:20:28 IT WAS STARTED OVER TWO YEARS AGO, OR TWO YEARS AGO, BEFORE THE COVID HIT, 
19:20:33 AND IT WAS MEANT TO CHRONICLE THE YEAR OF THE WOMAN IN 2020.

19:20:37 UNFORTUNATELY, THAT DID NOT HAPPEN UNTIL NOW.

19:20:46 SO I AM PLEASED THAT THE WASHINGTON HOSPITAL, ANGUS COCHRAN HAD BEEN ABLE 
19:20:52 TO LOCATE A ROOM IN WHICH TO HOUSE THE MURAL, WHICH TELLS ABOUT THE HISTORY 
19:20:54 OF THE ORGANIZATION.

19:20:56 IT DOES NOT COVER EVERYTHING.

19:20:59 125 YEARS DOES NOT COVER EVERYTHING IN ONE PAINTING.

19:21:03 BUT THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT TO THE CITY OF FREMONT, WHICH 
19:21:06 I THINK IS A VALUABLE ASSET.

19:21:07 THANK YOU FOR ACCEPTING IT.

19:21:11 THAT IS ALL I HAVE TO SAY.

19:21:16 THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

19:21:22 >> Mayor Mei: NO, THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH, MICHI, FOR SHARING THIS IN-DEPTH 
19:21:25 HISTORY THAT'S SO RICH FOR OUR COMMUNITY AND FOR ALLOWING US TO ENJOY 
19:21:29 THE PAINTING, AND THANK YOU FOR SHARING ALSO YOUR PERSONAL STORIES ON HOW THIS 
19:21:33 AFFECTED NOT JUST YOUR LIFE BUT SO MANY OTHER MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY.

19:21:34 WE'RE VERY GRATEFUL FOR THAT.

19:21:39 AND THANK YOU TO WASHINGTON HOSPITAL FOR ALLOWING US THE ROOM AND SPACE TO 
19:21:44 BE ABLE TO DEDICATE ESPECIALLY AS AN INSPIRATION TO SO MANY OF THE 
19:21:48 VOLUNTEERS THAT CONTINUE TO SERVE OUR COMMUNITY, AND A LEGACY FOR THE 
19:21:51 INCREDIBLE STRENGTH OF THE WOMEN WHO HELPED TO GET US THERE.

19:21:56 >> THANK YOU.

19:21:56 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:22:02 NEXT, I HAVE A PROCLAMATION FOR SUMMER LEARNING WEEK, WHICH IS JULY 11TH 
19:22:04 THROUGH 15TH OF 2022.

19:22:09 AND ACCEPTING THE PROCLAMATION WILL BE COMMUNITY SERVICE DIRECTOR SUZANNE 
19:22:15 WOLF AND RECREATION SUPERINTENDENT IRENE JORDAHL.

19:22:16 THANK YOU SO MUCH.

19:22:24  NOW, SUMMER IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER GIVEN FAMILIES ARE STRUGGLING TO 
19:22:28 KEEP KIDS ENGAGED IN LEARNING AND SUMMER PROVIDERS ARE ADAPTING TO 
19:22:36 COVID-19 REALITIES.SO THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT TO US BECAUSE WE'VE SEEN NOW 
19:22:38 MORE THAN EVER THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING THAT ACCESS.

19:22:44  WHEREAS, SUMMER LEARNING LOSS IS A REAL CONCERN AND REFERS TO THE 
19:22:45 TENDENCY FOR STUDENTS, ESPECIALLY THOSE FROM LOW-INCOME FAMILIES, TO LOSE SOME 
19:22:50 OF THE ACADEMIC SKILLS GAINED DURING THE PREVIOUS SCHOOL YEAR DUE TO LACK 
19:22:54 OF EXPOSURE TO EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES DURING THE SUMMER; AND WHEREAS, SUMMER 
19:23:01 LEARNING WEEK IS A TIME TO REFLECT ON THE IMPORTANCE OF KEEPING YOUNG PEOPLE 
19:23:06 LEARNING, SAFE, AND HEALTHY EVERY SUMMER, ENSURING THEY RETURN TO SCHOOL 
19:23:11 IN THE FALL READY TO SUCCEED IN THE YEAR AHEAD; AND PROVEN TO MAINTAIN AND 
19:23:15 ADVANCE STUDENTS’ ACADEMIC AND SOCIAL/EMOTIONAL GROWTH, KEEP CHILDREN 
19:23:20 SAFE AND HEALTHY DURING THE SUMMER, AND SEND YOUNG PEOPLE BACK TO SCHOOL READY 
19:23:23 TO LEARN; AND WHEREAS, IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE FREMONT UNIFIED SCHOOL 
19:23:30 DISTRICT, THE CITY OF FREMONT OFFERS THE SUMMER CAMP ACADEMY AT THREE 
19:23:33 ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SITES TO SUPPORT SUMMER LEARNING AND ENGAGEMENT WHILE

19:25:14 I'M REALLY PROUD THAT WE ARE PART OF THE NATIONAL LEAGUE OF CITIES, AND AS 
19:25:17 THE PRESIDENT FOR THE MAYOR'S TASK FORCE ON EDUCATION, THIS IS SOMETHING 
19:25:19 WE BELIEVE IN CHAMPIONING AND THAT THANKS TO THE CONTINUED PARTNERSHIP 
19:25:24 WITH THE SCHOOL BOARD AND WITH THE SCHOOL -- THE CITY, THE RECREATION 
19:25:27 PROGRAMS, IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO ADDRESS AND HELP.

19:25:31 SO I'D LOVE TO HEAR FROM COMMUNITY SERVICES DIRECTOR SUZANNE WOLF AND 
19:25:36 ALSO OUR RECREATION SUPERINTENDENT, IRENE JORDAHL.

19:25:37 THANK YOU.

19:25:40 >> THANK YOU, HONORABLE MAYOR MEI AND CITY COUNCIL FOR THIS PROCLAMATION FOR 
19:25:42 SUMMER LEARNING WEEK.

19:25:45 WITH ME IS OUR SUPERINTENDENT OVER THE SUMMER LEARNING  PROGRAMS.

19:25:48 TOGETHER THE CITY OF FREMONT'S COMMUNITY SERVICES DEPARTMENT WORKS 
19:25:52 COLLABORATIVELY WITH FREMONT UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT TO ENSURE OUR STUDENTS 
19:25:56 RECEIVE AMAZING RECREATION SUMMER PROGRAMS TO ENCOURAGE AND SUPPORT 
19:26:00 SUMMER LEARNING WITH STEM AND STEAM-BASED CREATIVITY, CURIOSITY, 
19:26:01 PLAY AND EXPLORATION.

19:26:05 THE VALUE OF OUR SUMMER PROGRAMS THAT ENGAGE THE SOCIAL EMOTIONAL AND 
19:26:08 LEARNING COMPONENTS OF OUR YOUNGEST RESIDENTS ARE CRITICAL TO OUR FREMONT 
19:26:09 FAMILIES.

19:26:14 WE WOULD LIKE TO THANK OUR SPONSORS SEAGATE AND THE GENEROUS DONORS WHO 
19:26:16 PROVIDED SCHOLARSHIPS TO THESE PROGRAMS.

19:26:20 FINALLY WE APPRECIATE ALL OF OUR PART-TIME SEASONAL EMPLOYEES AND FULL 
19:26:23 TIME STAFF WHO ARE COMMITTED TO YEAR AFTER YEAR PROVIDING GREAT LEARNING 
19:26:26  PROGRAMS FOR OUR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES THROUGHOUT THE SUMMER.

19:26:30 ALSO AS THIS IS PARKS AND RECREATION MONTH, THE RECOGNITION COULD NOT BE 
19:26:30  TIMELIER.

19:26:34 THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS PROCLAMATION IN RECOGNITION OF THE IMPORTANT WORK 
19:26:34 PROVIDED IN OUR COMMUNITY.

19:26:40 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU TO THE TEAM AND IRENE, WOULD YOU LIKE TO SHARE SOME 
19:26:40 THINGS?

19:26:42 >> I JUST WANTED TO SAY THANK YOU AS WELL.

19:26:47 IT'S WONDERFUL BECAUSE WE HAVE SO MANY WONDERFUL CHILDREN THAT WE'RE SERVING 
19:26:52 IN THE SUMMER, AS WELL AS SUZANNE SAID, HAVING THE YOUTH WORKING IN OUR 
19:26:52 PROGRAMS.

19:26:55 THEY START AS CAMPERS AND THEY MOVE THROUGH THE PROGRAM.

19:27:02 SO IT IS WONDERFUL TO SEE THOSE THAT YOU SAW AS CAMPERS AS EMPLOYEES.

19:27:05 SO AGAIN THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO THE MAYOR AND COUNCIL AND TO THE 
19:27:05 LEADERSHIP TEAM.

19:27:06 THANK YOU.

19:27:09 >> Mayor Mei: NO, THANK YOU FOR ALL THE STAFF MEMBERS WHO HAVE BEEN PROVIDING 
19:27:13 THIS SERVICE FOR MANY YEARS AND CONTINUE TO ENSURE THAT THERE'S EQUITY 
19:27:15 AND OPPORTUNITIES, AND FOR THE BUSINESSES WHO'VE HELPED WITH THIS AREA.

19:27:16 SO THANK YOU.

19:27:17 >> THANK YOU.

19:27:23 >> Mayor Mei: NEXT WE HAVE ON OUR ITEMS IS PUBLIC COMMUNICATIONS.

19:27:27 THESE ARE ITEMS THAT ARE NOT ON OUR AGENDA THIS EVENING.

19:27:30 NOT SCHEDULED ON OUR AGENDA.

19:27:34 COMMUNICATIONS RECEIVED VIA EMAIL WILL BE PLACED ON FILE AND CONSIDERED PART 
19:27:34 OF THE PUBLIC RECORD.

19:27:41 MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WISHING TO SPEAK ON ITEMS NOT ON THE AGENDA MAY DO SO 
19:27:45 BY PRESSING THE RAISE HAND ICON OR CALLING IN BY  DIALING STAR NINE.

19:27:49 IF NOT NOTED ON THE ZOOM SCREEN, PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME AND WHEN SPEAKING ON 
19:27:52 BEHALF OF AN ORGANIZATION, PLEASE SHARE THE NAME OF YOUR ORGANIZATION AS 
19:27:52 WELL.

19:27:57 AND THE CITY CLERK WILL START THE TIMER FOR EACH SPEAKER, AND LET'S SEE, I'M 
19:28:04 TRYING TO LOOK AT THE --

19:28:08  --

19:28:10 >> Ms. Gauthier: WE HAVE JOHN HINDS.

19:28:11 >> Mayor Mei: WELCOME,  MR. HINDS.

19:28:13 >> HELLO, EVERYONE.

19:28:17 LAST MONTH, I THANKED THE POLICE DEPARTMENT FOR SOME IMPROVEMENTS IN 
19:28:19 THEIR WEEKLY BLOTTER REPORT.

19:28:24 FOR ARRESTED ADULTS, THEY WERE INCLUDING NAME, AGE AND CITY, ALONG 
19:28:25 WITH WHETHER THE PERSON WAS HOMELESS.

19:28:31 BUT IT SEEMS THAT ALMOST IMMEDIATELY, THAT POLICY CHANGED AGAIN.

19:28:37 NOW WE'RE GETTING CITY-ONLY, NOT HOMELESS STATUS NAME OR AGE.

19:28:38 WHY?

19:28:44 SEEING PEOPLE'S NAMES CAN SEEM A LITTLE CREEPY, BUT AN ARREST IS AN OFFICIAL 
19:28:45 GOVERNMENT ACTION.

19:28:48 WE'RE DETAINING SOMEONE AGAINST HIS WISHING, WHEN ON THE WHOLE, HE'D 
19:28:51 PROBABLY RATHER BE IN PHILADELPHIA.

19:28:58 THE IDEA OF A MAKING ARRESTS IN SECRET IS EVEN CREEPIER, AND SO THESE ARE 
19:29:00 APPROPRIATELY A MATTER OF PUBLIC RECORD.

19:29:03 JOURNALISTS USED TO CHECK THE BLOTTERS EVERY MORNING FOR NEWS, AND WE 
19:29:04 TYPICALLY SAW PEOPLE'S NAMES.

19:29:08 THIS IS ESTABLISHED PRACTICE AND NOT SOMETHING NEW.

19:29:13 ON AGE, WELL, SOME PEOPLE ARE VERY SENSITIVE ABOUT THAT.

19:29:22 WHEN ZSA ZSA GABOR GOT ARRESTED THE CRUELEST PART OF HER SENTENCE WAS SHE 
19:29:26 HAD TO GIVE THE CORRECT YEAR OF BIRTH ON HER CALIFORNIA'S DRIVER'S LICENSE.

19:29:30 BUT AGE IS JUST AN IMPORTANT PART OF IDENTIFYING A PERSON SO WE KNOW WE 
19:29:30 HAVE THE RIGHT ONE.

19:29:33 SAME STORY FOR HEIGHT AND FOR WEIGHT.

19:29:36 UGH.

19:29:37 SAME STORY FOR ADDRESS.

19:29:40 YOU ASK FOR I.D., YOU ASK IF THIS IS THEIR CURRENT ADDRESS.

19:29:43 WHEN THE ANSWER IS "I DON'T REALLY HAVE AN ADDRESS RIGHT NOW BECAUSE I'M 
19:29:46 HOMELESS," THAT'S AN OBJECTIVE PART OF THE IDENTIFICATION TOO.

19:29:52 WHEN WE SET POLICIES FOR THE CITY, WE LIKE TO THINK THAT WE'RE MAKING GOOD 
19:29:55 USE OF WHATEVER INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE.

19:30:00 WITHHOLDING THE HOMELESS STATUS IS A BIG LOSS FOR US.

19:30:04 BECAUSE WE HAD JUST REACHED A POINT WHERE WE COULD USE ACTUAL OBSERVATIONS 
19:30:08 AND NOT JUST WHATEVER ASSUMPTIONS PEOPLE FOUND MOST APPEALING.

19:30:15 REJECTING ACTUAL OBSERVATIONS IN FAVOR OF HAPPIER ASSUMPTIONS IS NOT A HABIT 
19:30:18 THAT LEADS TO GOOD PLANS OR GOOD RESULTS.

19:30:23 PLEASE RESUME MAKING THIS PUBLIC INFORMATION PUBLIC.

19:30:25 AND MAYOR, SORRY ABOUT THE PHILADELPHIA THING.

19:30:27 THANK YOU.

19:30:28 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:30:35 I DO LIKE MY CITY OF BROTHERLY AND SISTERLY LOVE, BUT THANK YOU.

19:30:37 NEXT SPEAKER IS LAURA.

19:30:43 WELCOME, LAURA.

19:30:44 >> YES, GOOD EVENING.

19:30:45 THIS IS LAURA WINTER.

19:30:49 I'VE BEEN A RESIDENT OF FREMONT FOR ALMOST 40 YEARS.

19:30:50 MANY OF YOU KNOW ME.

19:30:57 I'VE PARTICIPATED IN LOTS OF COMMITTEES AND COMMISSIONS AND TASK FORCES, AND 
19:31:03 SO I TRY TO STAY UP ON WHAT'S GOING ON HERE IN THE CITY, AND I'M A BIT 
19:31:11 DISAPPOINTED AND QUITE CONCERNED THAT FREMONT BOULEVARD REMAINS THROUGH 
19:31:18  ONE LANE IN ONE DIRECTION.

19:31:23 IT'S BEEN SIX MONTHS SINCE YOU, THE COUNCIL, VOTED TO RETURN TO TWO LANES 
19:31:30 EACH WAY, SO THAT THOSE OF US WHO LIVE AND TRAVEL TO AND THROUGH THE CITY CAN 
19:31:31 EASILY GET THROUGH.

19:31:42 AND I'M CURIOUS AS TO WHY NOTHING HAS HAPPENED, WHY EVEN THOUGH IT'S GOING 
19:31:52 BACK TO MORE THROUGH LANES, THE CITY SHOULD STILL BE -- SHOULD BE TAKING 
19:31:54 THAT ACTION THAT THE COUNCIL VOTED ON.

19:32:02 SO I WOULD LIKE TO FIND OUT WHAT IS GOING ON AND WHAT THE TIMING IS.

19:32:08 SO I WOULD ASK THE COUNCIL AND THE STAFF TO, BEFORE YOU GO ON YOUR SUMMER 
19:32:15 RECESS, TO FIGURE OUT WHEN IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN AND INFORM THE COMMUNITY.

19:32:22 THERE'S LOTS OF US OUT HERE WHO EITHER WANT TO GET TO AND FROM HOME, WANT TO 
19:32:26 GET TO AND FROM HOLY SPIRIT CHURCH, WANT TO GET TO AND FROM THE SCHOOLS, 
19:32:29 AND IT'S EXTREMELY DIFFICULT THE WAY IT IS, WHICH IS WHY THE COUNCIL VOTED TO 
19:32:33 PUT IT BACK TO THE TWO LANES EACH WAY.

19:32:42 SO I WOULD JUST ASK THE CITY  TO -- WHOMEVER CAN POSSIBLY FIND OUT FROM 
19:32:47 PUBLIC WORKS WHAT THE PLAN IS AND WHAT THE SCHEDULE IS AND PLEASE LET THE 
19:32:49 COMMUNITY KNOW.

19:32:50 WE WOULD APPRECIATE IT VERY  MUCH.

19:32:50 THANK YOU.

19:32:53 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:33:03 AND AT THIS TIME I'M GOING TO CLOSE PUBLIC --

19:33:04 >> Ms. Gauthier: NEXT SPEAKER IS KELLY ABREU.

19:33:05 >> Mayor Mei: I DIDN'T SEE THAT.

19:33:05 THANK YOU.

19:33:13 >> SINCE ONE OF THE PREVIOUS SPEAKERS WAS TALKING ABOUT ARREST RECORDS AND 
19:33:18 HOW THEY'RE COUNTED, THEY COUNT THEM UP, THEY PUT THEM ON THE COMPREHENSIVE 
19:33:19 ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT OF THE CITY OF THE FREMONT.

19:33:22 IT CAME OUT, YOU KNOW, EARLIER THIS YEAR.

19:33:25 AND THEY'RE ALL RIGHT THERE, THEY'RE COUNTED UP.

19:33:32 BUT THE MOVING VIOLATIONS, YOU KNOW, IT'S KIND OF LIKE WHEN THEY GIVE YOU A 
19:33:35 TRAFFIC TICKET OR WHATEVER, A MOVING VIOLATION HAS A CERTAIN TECHNICAL 
19:33:43 MEANING ON THE DMV, ON YOUR RECORD, CAN COST HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS, THOSE KINDS 
19:33:43 OF MOVING VIOLATIONS.

19:33:47 YOU REPORTED 13,000 AND THERE WERE ANOTHER 19,000 THAT YOU DIDN'T REPORT 
19:33:49 THAT CAME OUT OF RED LIGHT CAMERAS.

19:33:52 AND THAT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR 10 YEARS.

19:34:00 RED LIGHT CAMERAS HAVE BEEN CRANKING OUT THOSE MOVING VIOLATIONS, AND THEY 
19:34:04 DON'T GET LISTED BY THE FINANCE  DEPARTMENT, THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE 
19:34:07 DOES NOT INCLUDE MOVING VIOLATIONS.

19:34:10 THAT IS PART OF VEHICLE MOVING AND PARKING VIOLATIONS.

19:34:14 ON THE COMPREHENSIVE ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT.

19:34:22 NOW THIS IS WRONG, AND THESE RECORDS NEED TO BE, YOU KNOW, CORRECTED, THEY 
19:34:27 NEED TO BE REISSUED, 10 YEARS WORTH, FROM 2012 THROUGH 2021.

19:34:32 SO WE CAN GET THE RIGHT NUMBERS OUT THERE.

19:34:34 IT'S NOT JUST A LITTLE MISTAKE.

19:34:39 I MEAN, IT'S MORE THAN -- MORE THAN HALF OF THE MOVING VIOLATIONS THE CITY 
19:34:48 ISSUED ARE NOT BEING COUNTED AND NOT BEING REPORTED ON THE -- AS THE CITY 
19:34:52 CLAIMS, AS THE FINANCE DEPARTMENT SAYS IT BEING  REPORTED ON THE 
19:34:53 COMPREHENSIVE ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT.

19:34:53 THANK YOU.

19:34:55 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:35:00 I THINK I WILL -- ARE THERE ANY OTHER PUBLIC COMMENTS?

19:35:05 SEEING NONE, I'M GOING TO CLOSE THE PUBLIC COMMENTS.

19:35:09 AND I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE AND QUESTIONS.

19:35:13 I KNOW THAT OUR CITY STAFF IS ON OUR CALL.

19:35:17 WE CAN'T ADDRESS ITEMS THAT ARE NOT AGENDIZED, BUT I THINK THAT WE WILL BE 
19:35:23 FOLLOWING UP ON SOME OF THOSE TO GIVE SOME RESPONSES IN TERMS OF TIMING ON 
19:35:25 SOME OF THE WORKS AND PROJECTS.

19:35:28 IT'S BEEN A LITTLE DELAYED PROBABLY THROUGH THE COVID TIME PERIOD BUT IT 
19:35:31 IS IMPORTANT FOR US AND WE TRY TO GET A LOT OF THE WORK, I KNOW, DONE, 
19:35:33 ESPECIALLY AROUND THE SCHOOLS DURING THE SUMMER.

19:35:37 SO HOPEFULLY THAT'S SOMETHING WE CAN GIVE AN UPDATE ON.

19:35:42 SO I'M CLOSING PUBLIC COMMENT AND GOING BACK TO THE ITEMS THAT WERE PULLED 
19:35:47 FROM THE AGENDA, AND THAT'S, I BELIEVE, ITEM F THROUGH L.

19:35:51  ON THE CONSENT CALENDAR, AND THAT WAS PULLED BY COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN.

19:35:56 >> Councilmember Kassan: YES, THANK YOU.

19:35:59 I DO THINK FOR THE PURPOSE OF TRANSPARENCY, IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT 
19:36:05 FOR THESE ITEMS NOT TO JUST BE PASSED ON CONSENT BECAUSE COLLECTIVELY THEY 
19:36:08 BLOW A PERMANENT HOLE IN OUR BUDGET.

19:36:14 WHICH INCREASES EVERY SINGLE YEAR FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE UNLESS 
19:36:14 SOMETHING CHANGES.

19:36:20 SO I JUST THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO HAVE A DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT IDEAS 
19:36:27 PEOPLE HAVE REGARDING WHAT BUDGET ITEMS ARE GOING TO BE CUT TO ADDRESS THIS.

19:36:36 WE SIMPLY MUST HAVE A BALANCED BUDGET AND I DON'T THINK MOST OF THE PUBLIC 
19:36:40 PROBABLY REALIZES THAT IF WE DO PASS THESE ITEMS, WE WILL NO LONGER HAVE A 
19:36:41  BALANCED BUDGET.

19:36:44 THE WHOLE DISCUSSION OF THE BUDGET THAT WE'VE HAD NEEDS TO BE THROWN OUT THE 
19:36:45 WINDOW AND WE NEED TO START ALL OVER.

19:36:53 AND ESPECIALLY GIVEN THAT WE HAVE MAYOR MEI IS POTENTIALLY GOING TO BE ELECTED 
19:37:00 TO HIGHER OFFICE QUITE SOON, I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE GET ON 
19:37:07 THE RECORD AS SOON AS POSSIBLE HOW WE CAN RESPONSIBLY CUT THE BUDGET TO MEET 
19:37:11 THESE -- TO MEET THIS DEFICIT AND SEE WHAT THE CITY COUNCIL IS GOING TO 
19:37:12 PROPOSE TO ADDRESS IT.

19:37:21 I JUST THINK IT'S REALLY IRRESPONSIBLE TO ADOPT PROPOSALS THAT CREATE A 
19:37:24 PERMANENT $10 MILLION AND GROWING BUDGET DEFICIT EVERY YEAR WITHOUT ANY 
19:37:28 DISCUSSION OF WHAT THOSE -- WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO TO ADDRESS IT.

19:37:33 ESPECIALLY GIVEN THAT SOME PEOPLE WILL VERY QUICKLY BE POTENTIALLY MOVING ON 
19:37:33 TO HIGHER OFFICE.

19:37:41 >> Mayor Mei: I THINK THAT -- I DON'T KNOW IF STAFF WANTS TO RESPOND TO SOME 
19:37:41 OF THIS.

19:37:45 I THINK THERE IS SOME BUDGET CONVERSATIONS.

19:37:47 CITY MANAGER, I SEE YOU'VE UNMUTED.

19:37:48 >> City Mgr. Shackelford: I  HAVE.

19:37:51 >> Mayor Mei: IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS THIS, THANK YOU.

19:37:52 >> City Mgr. Shackelford: THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY.

19:37:58 WELL, FIRST OFF, LET ME SAY THAT WHILE I DON'T HAVE ANY SPECIFIC BUDGET 
19:38:03 RECOMMENDATIONS AT THIS MOMENT, I WILL SAY THAT PART OF THE CONVERSATION THAT 
19:38:09 WE'VE HAD AS WE'VE GONE THROUGH THESE LABOR NEGOTIATIONS IS THAT IF 
19:38:15 SOMETHING IS RECOMMENDED AND/OR APPROVED ABOVE AND BEYOND WHAT WAS 
19:38:20 CONTEMPLATED IN OUR PROPOSED AND EVENTUALLY ADOPTED BUDGET, THAT IT 
19:38:24 WOULD BE VERY LIKELY THAT I'D BE COMING BACK TO THE COUNCIL WITH 
19:38:31 RECOMMENDATIONS TO DEFER SOME OF THE ADDITIONS OR MAYBE EVEN COMPLETELY 
19:38:36 ELIMINATE SOME OF THE APPROVED OR ADOPTED ITEMS.

19:38:41 I HAVE NOT COME TO ANY CONCLUSIONS ON THOSE ITEMS YET.

19:38:48 STAFF AND I WILL BE REVIEWING THOSE, BUT I WILL ALSO SAY, AND I'LL ASK OUR 
19:38:57 FINANCE DIRECTOR TO CHIME IN ON THIS, BUT AT THE POINT THE BUDGET WAS 
19:39:00 APPROVED, OR SINCE THE BUDGET WAS  APPROVED, I'LL SAY THAT, I'LL SAY IT 
19:39:04 THAT WAY, WE'VE RECEIVED ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.

19:39:12 YOU KNOW, GLOBALLY, WE'VE HEARD ABOUT A RECESSION, BUT WE CONTINUE TO RECEIVE 
19:39:18 SALES DATA INFORMATION OR SALES TAX DATA INFORMATION, PROPERTY TAX DATA 
19:39:20 INFORMATION THAT'S SPECIFIC TO OUR LOCAL ECONOMY.

19:39:26 SO OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF MONTHS, I WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE THAT, 
19:39:33 PARTICULARLY SINCE WE'LL BE LOOKING AT A COUNCIL RECESS IN AUGUST, BUT IN THE 
19:39:39 FALL, I INTEND TO COME BACK TO YOU ALL WITH IDEAS ON HOW WE CAN BALANCE THE 
19:39:40 BUDGET.

19:39:45 AND I HAVE NO DOUBT, LET ME SAY, I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT WE'LL BE ABLE TO BALANCE 
19:39:50 THE BUDGET, BUT IT WILL BE -- WILL VERY LIKELY BE AT THE EXPENSE OF SOME 
19:39:53 THINGS THAT WE WERE ANTICIPATING  HAPPENING.

19:40:01 SO I'LL STOP THERE AND ENTERTAIN ANY QUESTIONS OR ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS.

19:40:05 >> Councilmember Kassan: I PERSONALLY WOULD JUST -- I THINK IT'S REALLY 
19:40:09 IMPORTANT, GIVEN THAT THE CITY COUNCIL IS THE ULTIMATE DECIDER IN TERMS OF 
19:40:14 THE BUDGET, THAT IF ANY OF THE COUNCILMEMBERS HAVE OR THE MAYOR HAVE 
19:40:19 GIVEN ANY THOUGHT TO WHAT THEY WOULD CUT IN ORDER TO ACCOMMODATE THESE 
19:40:22 CONTRACTS, I THINK IT WOULD BE REALLY USEFUL FOR THE PUBLIC TO HEAR THAT.

19:40:27 I UNDERSTAND, OF COURSE, THE STAFF IS GOING TO DO EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO 
19:40:30 MAKE  RECOMMENDATIONS, BUT IT JUST SEEMS TO ME THAT THE PUBLIC DESERVES 
19:40:38 TO KNOW WHAT THEIR ELECTED OFFICIALS PLAN TO CUT IN ORDER TO ADOPT THESE 
19:40:46 CONTRACTS, AND I KNOW THAT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED IS 
19:40:49 POTENTIALLY CUTTING TWO NEW POSITIONS IN THE POLICE DEPARTMENT, POTENTIALLY 
19:40:52 CUTTING A NEW FIRE COMPANY.

19:40:58 I JUST THINK, YOU KNOW, YES, EVERYONE CAN STAY SILENT RIGHT NOW IF THEY SO 
19:41:01 CHOOSE, BUT I JUST DON'T THINK IT'S RESPONSIBLE TO ADOPT THESE CONTRACTS 
19:41:05 WITHOUT AT LEAST  GIVING SOME IDEA AS TO WHAT THE PEOPLE'S THOUGHT ARE ON 
19:41:09 WHAT THEY WILL CUT TO ACCOMMODATE THESE CONTRACTS.

19:41:17 >> Mayor Mei: I THINK RIGHT NOW ONE OF THE THINGS AS PAST YEARS WHEN WE'VE 
19:41:20 BEEN NEGOTIATING THE BUDGET OR CONTRACTS, WE COME TO THE TABLE AND WE 
19:41:23 RECOGNIZE THAT WE'RE PUTTING IN SOME PLACEHOLDERS AS TO WHAT WE'RE MAKING 
19:41:24 OUR DECISION OF ADOPTION.

19:41:29 WE'D LOVE TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THE FINALIZATION OF ALL THE INFORMATION, 
19:41:33 BUT SOMETIMES THAT'S NOT AVAILABLE, AND EVERY YEAR IN THE FALL, WE ALSO, 
19:41:37 WHETHER IT'S A BARGAINING YEAR OR NON-BARGAINING YEAR, WE DO A TRUE-UP 
19:41:43 IN TERMS OF LOOKING AT THE SALES TAX AND OTHER PROGRAMS, AND AT SUCH TIME 
19:41:46 DURING PAST YEARS, WE'VE ALSO HAD TO MAKE FINANCE ACTIONS IN TERMS OF 
19:41:50 EITHER IMPLEMENTING CUTS OR PUTTING HOLDS ON DIFFERENT THINGS, AND SO I 
19:41:55 WOULD DEFER TO OUR STAFF TO BE ABLE TO LOOK AT THOSE OPTIONS, BUT CERTAINLY 
19:42:01 WHEN WE HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS, THEY WILL BE DONE IN A PROCESS THAT'S OPEN 
19:42:02 AND INCLUDING THE PUBLIC'S FEEDBACK ON THAT.

19:42:06 WE DO HAVE THE DECISION-MAKING BUT CERTAINLY THOSE ARE SOME OF THE AREAS 
19:42:12 THAT I THINK OUR STAFF WILL BE ABLE TO GIVE US BETTER GUIDANCE AS WE LOOK AT 
19:42:15 WHERE WE STAND IN THE FALL, AND THAT WILL ALREADY HAVE A PART OF THE YEAR 
19:42:21 ALREADY IN TERMS OF OUR SALES TAX AND OTHER REVENUE STREAMS.

19:42:26 BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE WANTED TO ALSO EB SURE THAT I THINK IT ALSO 
19:42:32 IMPORTANT THAT THE PUBLIC UNDERSTANDS THAT WE APPRECIATE THAT EMPLOYEES AND 
19:42:35 OTHER GROUPS HAVE STEPPED UP IN THIS TIME PERIOD WHEN WE'RE GOING THROUGH 
19:42:39 THE PANDEMIC AND MANY PEOPLE JOINED IN SUPPORT TO ALLOW US TO BE ABLE TO HAVE 
19:42:47 SOME OF THE REVENUE BALANCE WE NEEDED PREVIOUSLY.

19:42:51 SO THIS IS KIND OF -- THIS OPPORTUNITY, BUT I WOULD FEEL FREE TO ASK STAFF IF 
19:42:57 THEY HAVE OTHER COMMENTS, BUT OTHERWISE I THINK IF ANY OF THE OTHER 
19:42:59 COUNCILMEMBERS HAVE COMMENTS, I SEE COUNCILMEMBER KENG HAS HER HAND RAISED.

19:43:00 >> Councilmember Keng: THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR.

19:43:06 SO I DO REALLY APPRECIATE AND ECHO THE SENTIMENTS EXPRESSED EARLIER BY 
19:43:07 COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN.

19:43:13 I DO THINK THAT IT WOULD BE TRULY -- ONLY TRULY RESPONSIBLE AND ACCOUNTABLE 
19:43:20 FOR THE CITY COUNCIL TO APPROVE THESE NEWLY ADOPTED CONTRACTS IF WE CAN 
19:43:26 SHARE WITH THE COMMUNITY AND THE PUBLIC WHAT TYPE OF ACTIONS WILL BE TAKEN TO 
19:43:28 BE ABLE TO BALANCE THAT BUDGET.

19:43:29 THANK YOU.

19:43:39 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:43:41 COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN AND I ALSO SEE VICE MAYOR SALWAN.

19:43:42 >> Councilmember Kassan: YES, THANK YOU.

19:43:47 SO I JUST -- YOU KNOW, I'M  SORRY, MAYOR, TO PUT YOU ON THE SPOT, BUT IT 
19:43:55 JUST SEEMS -- IT'S REALLY CONCERNING TO ME THAT YOU'RE WILLING TO ADOPT 
19:44:03  PROPOSALS THAT EVEN WITHOUT  THE -- WE DIDN'T EVEN ACCOUNT FOR THE 
19:44:06 POSSIBILITY OF SERIOUS RECESSION IN OUR CURRENT BUDGET, SO IT COULD BE EVEN 
19:44:15 WORSE, BUT WE ARE LOOKING AT, YOU KNOW, 7 MILLION, 8 MILLION, 9 MILLION, 10 
19:44:23 MILLION ANNUAL BUDGET DEFICIT FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE AND IT SOUNDS LIKE 
19:44:26 YOU HAVEN'T GIVEN ANY THOUGHT TO WHAT YOU WOULD CUT TO ADDRESS THAT AND WE 
19:44:30 WANT TO KNOW ARE YOU GOING ON RECORD RIGHT NOW AS SAYING YOU HAVEN'T GIVEN 
19:44:33 ANY THOUGHT TO WHAT SPECIFIC ITEMS MIGHT BE CUT AND YOU'RE JUST GOING TO 
19:44:36 LEAVE TO STAFF TO MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS WHICH ISN'T EVEN GOING TO HAPPEN UNTIL 
19:44:39 PROBABLY AFTER THE NOVEMBER ELECTION?

19:44:43 AND ALSO DO YOU THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE THAT TWO OF THE UNIONS WITH WHICH 
19:44:48 WE'RE NEGOTIATING ALSO MAXED OUT ON THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS TO YOUR SENATE 
19:44:51 CAMPAIGN, IS THAT APPROPRIATE TO BE NEGOTIATING WHEN THEY'VE GIVEN YOU 
19:44:52 MONEY FOR YOUR SENATE CAMPAIGN?

19:44:58 >> Mayor Mei: I'D LIKE TO THINK THAT THE DECISIONS WE'RE MAKING IN 
19:45:02 COLLECTIVE DISCUSSIONS WITH THE COUNCIL IS NOT PERTINENT IN TERMS OF WHETHER 
19:45:08 OR NOT I AM RUNNING FOR OFFICE OR NOT  RUNNING FOR OFFICE.

19:45:12 THEY ARE ISSUED WE'VE EXPLORED AND WORKED WITH OUR STAFF COLLECTIVELY AS 
19:45:13 A COUNCIL TO ADDRESS.

19:45:17 I CERTAINLY HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT WHAT ARE THE AREAS, BUT NOT SEEING THE COMPLETE 
19:45:20 PICTURE YET, I DON'T THINK IT WOULD BE MY PLACE TO DECIDE WHICH AREAS.

19:45:24 AND I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT THAT WE COLLECTIVELY AS A COUNCIL WOULD HAVE 
19:45:28 THAT CONVERSATION WHEN WE HAVE THAT FULL INFORMATION.

19:45:32 BUT CERTAINLY, I HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT ALL THE DIFFERENT AREAS AND THAT'S WHY 
19:45:35 DURING SOME OF THE CONVERSATIONS, THOSE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE  LOOKED 
19:45:39 AT SPECIFICALLY TO ENSURE THAT WE'D BE ABLE TO BALANCE THE BUDGET AS NEEDED.

19:45:42 VICE MAYOR SALWAN?

19:45:45 >> Vice Mayor Salwan: THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR.

19:45:50 YEAH, I WOULD LIKE TO JOIN THE DISCUSSION.

19:45:54 YOU KNOW, I BELIEVE THAT WE'VE ALWAYS HAD A BALANCED BUDGET, AND I'M SURE 
19:45:58 THAT ALL OF US ARE COMMITTED TO HAVE A BALANCED BUDGET FOR THIS CYCLE.

19:46:00 I'M SEEING EVERYBODY NODDING  YES.

19:46:01 >> Mayor Mei: MM-HMM.

19:46:05 >> Vice Mayor Salwan: SO I HAVE A QUESTION FOR CITY MANAGER SHACKELFORD.

19:46:11 WHEN WILL THIS DISCUSSION COME UP SO THAT WE CAN MAKE THESE DECISIONS?

19:46:15 >> City Mgr. Shackelford: THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION.

19:46:22 I ANTICIPATE THE DISCUSSION COMING UP IN THE  SEPTEMBER/OCTOBER TIME FRAME.

19:46:29 AGAIN WE'RE CONTINUING TO GATHER DATA, SALES TAX DATA, PROPERTY TAX DATA, ET 
19:46:35 CETERA, WHICH WILL HELP BETTER INFORM THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE MAKE.

19:46:42 BUT THE DISCUSSION WILL DEFINITELY BE COMING FORWARD BECAUSE IT'S AN 
19:46:51 IMPORTANT DISCUSSION, IT'S A NECESSARY DISCUSSION AND WE WANT FREMONT TO BE A 
19:46:51 FINANCIALLY STABLE COMPLEUBT.

19:46:55  COMMUNITY.

19:46:59 WE WERE ALL AWARE AS RECOMMENDS WERE BEING MADE.

19:47:04 STAFF MADE RECOMMENDATIONS BASED ON MARKET DATA NUMBERS, BUT THERE WERE 
19:47:08 OTHER THINGS THAT WERE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION, YOU KNOW, COST OF 
19:47:14 LIVING AND EMPLOYEE RESPONSE DURING COVID AND ALL OF THAT, AND I THINK AT 
19:47:18 LEAST FOR ME AS A CITY MANAGER, WHAT I HEARD FROM THE MAJORITY OF THE KOWNL 
19:47:24 IS THAT YOU ALL WERE WILLING TO TAKE THOSE THINGS INTO CONSIDERATION AND 
19:47:28 MAKE SOME POTENTIAL ADJUSTMENTS TO THE BUDGET IN ORDER TO ACCOMMODATE SOME OF 
19:47:32 THOSE ITEMS.

19:47:35 SO AGAIN, SEPTEMBER/OCTOBER TIME FRAME IS WHEN WE'LL BE BACK.

19:47:38 >> THROUGH THE MAYOR, MAY I SUPPLEMENT THAT RESPONSE?

19:47:39 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU, YES.

19:47:40 >> THANK YOU.

19:47:47 JUST FROM A BROWN ACT PERSPECTIVE OBVIOUSLY THE BUDGET, ANY BUDGETARY 
19:47:51 IMPACTS, THAT'S NOT ON THE AGENDA THIS EVENING SO WE ARE LIMITED TO WHAT WE 
19:47:54 SEE IN TERMS OF THINGS ON THE AGENDA.

19:47:58 CLARIFYING QUESTIONS ARE  PERFECTLY ACCEPTABLE BUT BUDGETARY DECISIONS ARE 
19:48:01 GOING TO HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL IT'S PROPERLY AGENDIZED AND AT THAT POINT, 
19:48:03 THE COUNCIL WILL BE ABLE TO MAKE COLLECTIVE DECISIONS ABOUT WHAT 
19:48:07 IMPACTS ARE BEING MADE AND WHAT DECISIONS NEED TO BE MADE TO ADJUST 
19:48:08 THE BUDGET AT THAT TIME.

19:48:09 THANK YOU, MAYOR.

19:48:10 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:48:13 AND THAT'S WHY IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE THE FULL PARTICIPATION OF THE 
19:48:15 COUNCIL IN THESE DESITIONS.

19:48:17  DECISIONS.

19:48:19 COUNCILMEMBER JONES.

19:48:23 >> Councilmember Jones: I BELIEVE VICE MAYOR SALWAN STILL HAS SOME COMMENTS.

19:48:24 >> Mayor Mei: SORRY, THANK YOU.

19:48:27 >> Vice Mayor Salwan: I JUST WANTED TO THANK BOTH THE CITY MANAGER AND THE 
19:48:30  THE CITY ATTORNEY FOR FRAMING THE DISCUSSION.

19:48:34 I THINK THIS DESERVES A ROBUST DISCUSSION WITH ALL THE INFORMATION.

19:48:38 I DON'T THINK THIS IS SOMETHING WE CAN DO BY THE SEAT OF OUR PANTS, AND START 
19:48:43 THROWING STUFF OUT THERE WITHOUT HAVING A FULL DISCUSSION OF THE IMPACTS OF 
19:48:46 WHAT WE ARE ADDING, WHAT WE'RE CUTTING, HOW THE REVENUES ARE LOOKING.

19:48:48 I THINK WE HAVE TO LOOK AT ALL THAT.

19:48:51 WE ALSO HAVE TO LOOK AT THE  SAVINGS WE'VE HAD.

19:48:56 YOU KNOW, A LOT OF OUR STAFF TOOK A ZERO PERCENT CONTRACT THE YEAR BEFORE.

19:49:01 WE'VE HAD SOME VACANCIES, SO I THINK WE HAVE TO HAVE A FULL DISCUSSION, NOT 
19:49:03 JUST A PIECEMEAL ONE-OFF DISCUSSION.

19:49:09 AND ALSO AS A COUNCIL, WE HAVE A POLICY THAT WE DON'T ATTACK THE MOTIVES OF 
19:49:13 FELLOW  COUNCILMEMBERS, SO I DON'T THINK IT'S FAIR TO THROW THAT OUT 
19:49:15 THERE JUST TO, YOU KNOW, FOR POLITICAL POINTS.

19:49:20 HAVING SAID THAT, AND THE FEEDBACK FROM THE CITY ATTORNEY AND CITY MANAGER, I 
19:49:25 WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A MOTION TO LIMIT THE DEBATE AND LET'S GO AHEAD AND VOTE 
19:49:26 ON THIS.

19:49:26 THANK YOU.

19:49:27 >> Mayor Mei: OKAY.

19:49:33 WE HAVE TWO OTHER  COUNCILMEMBERS' HANDS WHO ARE RAISED, WE HAVE THE 
19:49:34 MOTION AND DO WE HAVE A SECOND?

19:49:35 SECOND BY COUNCILMEMBER JONES.

19:49:38 COUNCILMEMBER JONES, YOU'RE NEXT TO SPEAK.

19:49:42 >> Councilmember Jones: I'LL KEEP IT VERY BRIEF.

19:49:46 I CONCUR COMPLETELY WITH VICE MAYOR SALWAN AND MR. ALVARADO, THIS IS NOT 
19:49:50 THE TIME OR THE PLACE FOR THIS DISCUSSION, ANDLY REMIND EVERYONE THAT 
19:49:53 THERE IS A NON-PARTISAN COUNCIL AND WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT POLITICS, WE ARE 
19:49:59 TALKING ABOUT THE GOOD OF OUR RESIDENTS AND WHAT WE CAN DO MOVING FORWARD.

19:49:59 THANK YOU.

19:50:00 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:50:01 COUNCILMEMBER COX.

19:50:04 >> Councilmember Cox: YES.

19:50:09 I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S CLEAR THAT WE'RE ONLY TALKING ABOUT THE 
19:50:16 CONTRACTS TONIGHT AND THAT WITH THE UNDERSTANDING, IF I MAY DO A FRIENDLY 
19:50:27 SUGGESTION AND AMENDMENT TO COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN'S MOTION IS NOT 
19:50:31 ONLY TO APPROVE WHAT WE HAVE ON THE CONSENT AGENDA, BUT ALSO WITH THE 
19:50:35 UNDERSTANDING THAT WE COULD SET A TIME AND DATE OF THE FIRST MEETING IN 
19:50:43 OCTOBER TO BE ABLE TO REVIEW THE BUDGET INFORMATION AND AT THAT TIME THAT WE 
19:50:48 COULD DISCUSS THAT FURTHER, BUT JUST TO HAVE THAT, WE HAVE SOME SORT OF 
19:50:55 AGREEMENT THAT WE CAN MOVE FORWARD WITH THE AGENDA TONIGHT, BUT PART 2 IS TO 
19:51:02 RECOGNIZE THAT ALLOWING THE STAFF TO PROVIDE TIME IN OCTOBER TO PROVIDE THE 
19:51:08 FINDINGS AND THE RECOMMENDATIONS AFTER THEY'VE THOROUGHLY INVESTIGATED OUR 
19:51:13 FINANCIAL SITUATION BECAUSE AFTER ALL, WE JUST STARTED ON A NEW PHYSICAL YEAR 
19:51:22 STARTING ON JULY 1ST OF THIS MONTH AND WE HAVE NOT SEEN ALL OF THE 
19:51:29 TRANSACTIONS THAT HAS TAKEN PLACE REALLY FOR THE FIRST THREE MONTHS THAT 
19:51:29 YOU DID NOT SEE.

19:51:34 SO I WOULD LIKE JUST TO BE ABLE TO MAKE A SLIGHT RECOMMENDATION, AND JUST TO 
19:51:41 CONCUR BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT OUR FINANCE TEAM HAS WON MANY NUMEROUS AWARDS FOR 
19:51:47 THEIR FINANCIAL GOVERNMENT MANAGEMENT AWARD, I'M NOT SURE IF I'M SAYING THE 
19:51:53 CORRECT  AWARDS, BUT BASICALLY THEY'RE SAYING THEY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE  DOING, 
19:51:57 BUT WE NEED TIME TO GIVE THE CITY STAFF ENOUGH TIME TO REVIEW THE INFORMATION 
19:52:05 AND THE NUMBERS AND THEN TRUE UP, COME BACK AND PROVIDE SOME RECOMMENDATIONS 
19:52:10 AFTER ALLOWING FOR THE FIRST QUARTER TO SEE HOW THINGS GO IN ORDER TO MAKE ANY 
19:52:11 TYPE OF ADJUSTMENTS TO THE BUDGET.

19:52:18 SO LONG STORY SHORT, I DON'T KNOW IF THAT IS ACCEPTABLE.

19:52:26 I KNOW THAT THERE HAS BEEN A MOTION, IT'S BEEN SECONDED BUT I'M GOING TO 
19:52:31 TURN IT BACK OVER TO THE MAYOR TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY OTHER --

19:52:34 >> Mayor Mei: I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENT ON THAT AND FOR OUR FISCAL MANAGEMENT 
19:52:36 IN THE PAST AND THE RECOGNITION OF THAT.

19:52:41 AND I SEE DIRECTOR PERSSELIN HAS HIS HAND RAISED, PROBABLY BECAUSE OF THE 
19:52:46 TIMING WE NORMALLY DO OUR UPDATE BUT I'LL TURN THAT TO DIRECTOR PERSSELIN 
19:52:46 TO RESPOND.

19:52:47 >> Mr. Persselin: THANKS, MAYOR.

19:52:49 SO I'M FINE WITH SETTING A DATE.

19:52:56 HOWEVER, I WOULD ASK FOR THE THIRD MEETING IN OCTOBER RATHER THAN THE 
19:52:57 FIRST MEETING.

19:53:05 AS HAS BEEN NOTED, THE CHANGE RELATED IN OUR BUDGET RELATED TO THE MOUs THAT 
19:53:12 YOU'RE BEING  ASKED TO APPROVE TONIGHT ARE ONE OF SEVERAL THINGS THAT WE WILL 
19:53:14 NEED TO CONSIDER.

19:53:19 WE PROPOSED THE BUDGET BACK IN APRIL BASED ON A SET OF ASSUMPTIONS, AND 
19:53:23 WHEN WE COME BACK TO MAKE MODIFICATIONS TO THE BUDGET, WE WANT TO MAKE SURE 
19:53:25 THAT WE REVISED ALL OF THOSE ASSUMPTIONS.

19:53:29 ONE OF THE KEY ASSUMPTIONS IS OUR SALES TAX REVENUE, AND WE WILL NOT BE 
19:53:36 RECEIVING ANY DATA ABOUT THAT UNTIL AROUND THE END OF THE MONTH OF 
19:53:36 SEPTEMBER.

19:53:42 SO I WOULD ASK THAT IF YOU WANT TO SET A DATE, THAT IT BE THE THIRD MEETING 
19:53:42 IN OCTOBER.

19:53:44 >> City Mgr. Shackelford: OR UP TO THE THIRD MEETING IN OCTOBER.

19:53:47 >> Mayor Mei: YES, UP TO AS NEEDED, I THINK I'M OKAY WITH THAT IDEA TOO.

19:53:51 I THINK THAT ALLOWS US, BECAUSE WE HAVE TO GET THE REPORTING FROM THE STATE, 
19:53:54 WHICH HAS BEEN CONSISTENT AS IN THE PAST.

19:53:55 >> Vice Mayor Salwan: SO I ACCEPT THAT AMENDMENT.

19:53:57 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:53:59 AND I SEE THE SECOND.

19:54:05 SO SEEING THE MOTION AND THE SECOND, COULD I HAVE A ROLL CALL VOTE ON THIS, 
19:54:05 PLEASE?

19:54:05 THANK YOU.

19:54:12 >> Ms. Gauthier: YES, MADAME MAYOR.

19:54:16 COUNCILMEMBER COX, AYE, WITH THE ORIGINAL PLUS THE AMENDMENT.

19:54:18 JUST TO BE CLEAR.

19:54:20 >> Ms. Gauthier: COUNCILMEMBER SHAO, AYE.

19:54:23 COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, NO.

19:54:26 COUNCILMEMBER JONES, AYE.

19:54:30 COUNCILMEMBER KENG, AYE.

19:54:32 VICE MAYOR SALWAN, AYE.

19:54:33 MAYOR MEI, AYE.

19:54:36 SO THE MOTION PASSES  UNANIMOUSLY.

19:54:41 AND NEXT ON OUR AGENDA ITEM THIS EVENING --

19:54:42 >> Councilmember Keng: MAYOR, IT WAS NOT UNANIMOUS.

19:54:44 >> Mayor Mei: I'M SORRY, NOT UNANIMOUSLY.

19:54:45 SORRY.

19:54:50 WITH THE EXCEPTION OF COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN VOTING NAY.

19:55:00 NEXT ON OUR AGENDA ITEM THIS EVENING IS ITEM 5A, WHICH IS THE DRAFT 2023-2031 
19:55:01 HOUSING ELEMENT.

19:55:05 AND THIS IS A PUBLIC HEARING, AND SO WE HAVE THE COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT 
19:55:10 DIRECTOR, DAN SCHOENHOLZ, WHO WILL PROVIDE US WITH AN INTRODUCTION.

19:55:17 THANK YOU.

19:55:20 >> GOOD EVENING, MAYOR MEI AND VICE MAYOR, COUNCILMEMBERS.

19:55:27 TONIGHT STAFF FROM THE PLANNING DIVISION WILL PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF 
19:55:29 THE PUBLIC DRAFT OF THE UPDATED GENERAL PLAN HOUSING ELEMENT.

19:55:37 THIS DRAFT DOCUMENT IS THE CULMINATION OF MANY MONTHS OF TECHNICAL ANALYSIS 
19:55:37 AND PUBLIC OUTREACH.

19:55:43 STAFF IS SEEKING COUNCIL FEEDBACK, WHICH WILL BE INCORPORATED INTO THE 
19:55:46 DOCUMENT BEFORE WE SUBMIT TO THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND COMMUNITY 
19:55:51 DEVELOPMENT FOR THEIR REVIEW AND COMMENT.

19:55:54 CITIES THROUGHOUT NORTHERN CALIFORNIA ARE GOING THROUGH THE SAME UPDATE 
19:55:59 PROCESS RIGHT NOW, AND BEFORE WE START THE PRESENTATION, I DID WANT TO 
19:56:04 HIGHLIGHT THAT FREMONT IS IN A DIFFERENT POSITION THAN MOST CITIES IN 
19:56:10 THAT WE DO NOT EXPECT TO HAVE TO REZONE ANY LAND TO ACCOMMODATE THE ALMOST 
19:56:15 13,000 NEW UNITS THAT REPRESENT OUR SHARE OF THE REGIONAL HOUSING NEED.

19:56:24 THE REASON FOR THIS IS THAT THE CITY'S 2011 GENERAL PLAN ANTICIPATED THE NEED 
19:56:30 FOR A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF NEW HOUSING AND PUT RULES IN PLACE TO FOCUS THAT 
19:56:37 GROWTH IN AREAS AS TRANSIT WHAT WE REFER TO AS STRATEGICALLY URBAN 
19:56:37 DEVELOPMENT.

19:56:41 SO WHILE SOME OF THAT  DEVELOPMENT HAS OCCURRED IN THE LAST 11 YEARS, OUR 
19:56:45 ANALYSIS SHOWS WE HAVE ENOUGH REMAINING CAPACITY TO ACCOMMODATE HOUSING NEEDS 
19:56:47 FOR THE NEXT EIGHT YEARS AS WELL.

19:56:53 I SHOULD NOTE THAT THE STATE STILL HAS TO CONCUR WITH OUR ANALYSIS BEFORE WE 
19:56:58 CAN DEFINITIVELY SAY THAT NO  REZONING LAND WILL BE NECESSARY, BUT WE'RE 
19:56:59 OPTIMISTIC THAT THEY WILL DO SO.

19:57:04 SINCE THE GENERAL PLAN ALREADY HAS DETERMINED WHERE GROWTH WILL BE 
19:57:11 FOCUSED, OUR HOUSING ELEMENT PROCESS HAS THEREFORE STAYED FOCUSED ON HOW TO 
19:57:13 PROMOTE HOUSING PRODUCTION, AND PARTICULARLY AFFORDABLE HOUSING.

19:57:18 SO I JUST WANTED TO GIVE THAT BIT OF CONTEXT AND WITH THAT, I'LL TURN 
19:57:23 THINGS OVER TO PRINCIPAL PLANNER WAYLAND LI, WHO WILL BEGIN THE 
19:57:23 PRESENTATION.

19:57:24 THANK YOU.

19:57:28 >> THANK YOU, DAN.

19:57:32 AGAIN, THE ITEM BEFORE YOU IS A PRESENTATION ON THE PUBLIC REVIEW 
19:57:38 DRAFT OF THE 2023-2031 HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATE, WHICH IS AN EIGHT-YEAR PLAN TO 
19:57:40 MEET THE HOUSING NEEDS OF EVERYONE IN THE COMMUNITY.

19:57:46 THE PURPOSE OF THIS ITEM IS TO INTRODUCE THE COUNCIL TO THE DRAFT 
19:57:50 HOUSING ELEMENT, TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AND TO SOLICIT COMMENTS AND FEEDBACK.

19:57:55 WE'RE NOT ASKING THE COUNCIL TO CONSIDER ADOPTION OF A DRAFT AT THIS 
19:58:00 TIME, BUT INSTEAD THIS ITEM IS INTENDED TO BE THE KICKOFF OF WHAT WE'RE 
19:58:02 CALLING THE SECOND PHASE OF OUR PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT PROCESS.

19:58:08 IN THE FIRST PHASE, WE WENT OUT TO THE PUBLIC TO LISTEN TO THE COMMUNITY'S 
19:58:14 PRIORITY, CONCERNS AND IDEAS, AND USING THAT INPUT AS A FOUNDATION, STAFF HAS 
19:58:22 PUT TOGETHER THE DRAFT HOUSING ELEMENT THAT'S BEFORE THE COUNCIL THIS 
19:58:23 EVENING.

19:58:26 NOW IN THE SECOND PHASE, WE'RE COMING BACK TO THE COUNCIL AND BACK TO THE 
19:58:30 COMMUNITY WITH A TANGIBLE WORK PRODUCT IN HAND TO REACT TO.

19:58:34 AND WE'RE NOW LOOKING FOR FEEDBACK AND INPUT BASED ON THIS DRAFT.

19:58:39 AND WITH THIS INPUT, WE'LL SEEK TO FURTHER REFINE THE DOCUMENT.

19:58:46 FOR TONIGHT'S PRESENTATION, WE'LL START WITH A QUICK INTRODUCTION OF WHAT A 
19:58:47 HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATE IS.

19:58:53 I'LL DISCUSS SOME OF THE FEEDBACK THAT WE'VE HEARD FROM THE COMMUNITY SO FAR.

19:58:58 AND THEN I'LL HAND THE PRESENTATION OFF TO COURTNEY  PAL, WHO'S GOING TO TALK 
19:59:01 ABOUT SOME OF THE NOTABLE PROGRAMS AND FEATURES OF THE DRAFT HOUSING ELEMENT.

19:59:09 FIRST OFF IS A QUICK RECAP OF WHAT IS A HOUSING ELEMENT.

19:59:15 UNDER STATE LAW, CITIES AND COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA ARE REQUIRED TO PLAN FOR 
19:59:17 THE HOUSING NEEDS OF EVERYONE IN THE COMMUNITY.

19:59:22 BY INCLUDING HOUSING ELEMENT AS ONE OF THE SEVEN MANDATORY ELEMENTS OF THE 
19:59:23 GENERAL PLAN.

19:59:29 IT'S DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHER ELEMENTS OF THE GENERAL PLAN IN THAT IT 
19:59:33 REQUIRED TO BE UPDATED EVERY EIGHT YEARS, AND IT'S SUBJECT TO REVIEW AND 
19:59:36 APPROVAL BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

19:59:40 WHAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS LOOKING AT IS TO ENSURE THAT THE HOUSING 
19:59:43 ELEMENT IS IN ALIGNMENT WITH THE STATE'S OVERALL HOUSING GOALS.

19:59:52 AN LIKE ALL BAY AREA CITIES, FREMONT IS IN THE PROCESS OF UPDATING THE HOUSING 
19:59:54 ELEMENT WHICH WOULD OCCUR BETWEEN YEARS 2023 AND 2031.

20:00:05 THE PURPOSE OF THE HOUSING ELEMENT IS TO ESTABLISH A POLICY AGENDA FOR 
20:00:08 FACILITATING PRODUCTION OF HOUSING AT ALL INCOME LEVELS TO MEET THE 
20:00:09 COMMUNITY'S NEEDS.

20:00:14 ADDITIONALLY, THE HOUSING ELEMENT IS REQUIRED TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THE 
20:00:19 JURISDICTION HAS CAPACITY TO ACCOMMODATE ITS FAIR SHARE OF THE 
20:00:22 REGION'S HOUSING NEEDS OVER THE NEXT EIGHT YEARS, WHICH IS KNOWN AS THE 
20:00:27 REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS ALLOCATION, OR RHNA, PROCESS.

20:00:33 FREMONT'S FAIR SHARE OF THE REGION'S HOUSING NEEDS FOR THE UPCOMING 
20:00:38 2023-2031 PLANNING PERIOD HAS BEEN DETERMINED TO BE 12,897 UNITS IN TOTAL.

20:00:51 WITH THE MAJORITY SERVING VERY LOW, MODERATELY LOW AND LOW INCOME 
20:00:51 HOUSEHOLDS.

20:00:56 IT'S BEEN A LONG ROAD TO GET TO THE POINT IN THE PROCESS WHERE WE ARE NOW 
20:00:59 -- WHERE WE HAVE A DRAFT AVAILABLE FOR PUBLIC REVIEW.

20:01:06 WE KICK OFF THE PROCESS IN EARLY 2021, AND AS THE COUNCIL MAY RECALL, WE'VE 
20:01:10 BEEN BEFORE YOU ON A FEW OCCASIONS SINCE THEN TO GIVE YOU AN OVERVIEW OF 
20:01:13 THE HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATE PROCESS AND TO DISCUSS SOME INITIAL FINDINGS FROM 
20:01:14 OUR ANALYSIS.

20:01:24 THE LAST TIME WE WERE HERE, WHICH WAS EARLIER IN THE YEAR, WE HEARD LOUD AND 
20:01:29 CLEAR FROM THE COUNCIL TO GO OUT TO THE COMMUNITY, TO LISTEN AND TO 
20:01:33 MEANINGFULLY ENGAGE WITH THE PUBLIC ABOUT THE HOUSING  ELEMENT.

20:01:36 SO OUR APPROACH WAS  MULTIFACETED.

20:01:41 WE CONDUCTED OFFICE HOURS WHERE PEOPLE COULD CONVENIENTLY SCHEDULE TIME TO 
20:01:43 TALK TO THE HOUSING ELEMENT TEAM.

20:01:49 WE WENT OUT TO THE COMMUNITY -- WE WENT OUT TO COMMUNITY EVENTS AND TALKED TO 
20:01:54 PEOPLE, WE VISITED THE CITY -- WE VISITED VARIOUS CITY BOARDS AND 
20:01:57 COMMISSIONS TO COLLECT THEIR FEEDBACK.

20:02:02 WE PUSHED OUT INFORMATION THROUGH THE CITY'S VARIOUS COMMUNICATION CHANNELS, 
20:02:06 AND WE ENGAGED IN SOME REGIONAL CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE HOUSING 
20:02:06 ELEMENT.

20:02:15 RECOGNIZING THAT REACHING LOWER INCOME RESIDENTS WAS A CRITICAL PIECE TO OUR 
20:02:22 ENGAGEMENT  STRATEGY, IN THAT LOWER INCOME RESIDENTS OFTEN HAVE LIMITED 
20:02:26 ACCESS TO TRADITIONAL BOARD AND COMMISSION MEETINGS, THIS IS DUE TO 
20:02:29 SCHEDULES, LANGUAGE BARRIERS AND TECHNOLOGY.

20:02:33 STAFF DECIDED TO BRING COMMUNITY OUTREACH DIRECTLY TO THOSE RESIDENTS.

20:02:40 SPECIFICALLY WE HELD LISTENING SESSIONS AT HOMELESS SHELTERS AND AFFORDABLE 
20:02:49 HOUSING  DEVELOPMENTS SUCH AS THE SUNRISE VILLAGE CENTERS, THE WEAVER 
20:02:54 AND COTTONWOOD AFFORDABLE DEVELOPMENTS AND OAK GARDENS WHICH SERVES LOW 
20:02:56 INCOME,  DISABLED AND DEAF INDIVIDUALS.

20:03:00 AND WE WILL CONTINUE OUR ENGAGEMENT EFFORTS THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRETY OF THE 
20:03:03 PROCESS UNTIL ADOPTION AND CERTIFICATION OF THE HOUSING ELEMENT.

20:03:11 WE HEARD QUITE A BIT FROM THE COMMUNITY, AND WHAT WE TRIED TO DO WAS 
20:03:18 TO FIND COMMON THEMES FROM ENGAGEMENT, AND TO TRANSLATE THOSE THEMES INTO 
20:03:21 ACTIONABLE PROGRAMS WITHIN THE HOUSING ELEMENT.

20:03:25 SO HERE ARE JUST A FEW OF THE IMPORTANT THEMES THAT WE HEARD FROM THE 
20:03:26 COMMUNITY.

20:03:33 FIRST, AMONG ALL GROUPS CONSULTED, HOUSING AFFORDABILITY WAS THE LARGEST 
20:03:35 AND MOST OFTEN HEARD CONCERN.

20:03:45 THERE WAS A FEELING THAT FREMONT IS A VERY DESIRABLE PLACE TO LIVE, AND THAT 
20:03:48 THEY OFTEN SEE MORE DEMAND THAN IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS.

20:03:54 THERE WAS CONSENSUS THAT THE CITY NEEDED TO INCREASE AFFORDABLE HOUSING 
20:03:56 PRODUCTION IN ORDER TO MEET THE HOUSING NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY.

20:04:07 WE ALSO HEARD A VERY STRONG DESIRE TO PROVIDE MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR 
20:04:11 COMMUNITY INPUT AROUND HOUSING AND THE IMPORTANCE OF THE HOUSING NEED IN THE 
20:04:11 COMMUNITY.

20:04:15 WE ALSO HEARD DIFFERENT SEGMENTS OF THE COMMUNITY, LIKE SENIORS AND LARGE 
20:04:18 FAMILIES, HAVE SPECIAL HOUSING NEEDS AND PLANNING EFFORTS SHOULD BE 
20:04:20 RESPONSIVE TO THOSE SPECIFIC NEEDS.

20:04:30 WE ALSO HEARD THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVE OUR DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS 
20:04:35 AND OUR PROCESSES TO FACILITATE PRODUCTION OF KEY HOUSING TYPES LIKE 
20:04:39 DEED-RESTRICTED AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND ADUs.

20:04:43 NOW THE DRAFT DOCUMENT THAT WE BROUGHT FORWARD TONIGHT, WE MADE AN EFFORT TO 
20:04:49 TRY TO CONNECT THE VARIOUS THEMES OF ENGAGEMENT AND EACH OF THE POLICIES, 
20:04:53 GOALS AND PROGRAMS IN THE HOUSING ELEMENT, AND THAT THERE'S A DRAFT 
20:04:56 AVAILABLE, WE WANT TO GO BACK TO THE COUNCIL, TO THE COMMUNITY, AND 
20:05:01 CONTINUE THIS DIALOGUE TO ENSURE WE'RE MAKING POLICY CHOICES THAT REINFORCE 
20:05:02 THE  VALUES OF THE COMMUNITY.

20:05:12 IN ADDITION TO COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT, STAFF HAS CONDUCTED EXTENSIVE 
20:05:16 ANALYSIS, INCLUDING AN ASSESSMENT OF DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION TO IDENTIFY 
20:05:25 THE COMMUNITY'S HOUSING NEEDS, CONSTRAINTS TO HOUSING PRODUCTION, A 
20:05:30 REVIEW OF SUCCESSES -- AND ASSESSMENT OF FAIR HOUSING ISSUES IN THE CITY.

20:05:35 NOW I'D LIKE TO TURN THE PRESENTATION OVER TO COURTNEY PAL, WHO'S GOING TO 
20:05:40 DISCUSS SOME OF THE NOTABLE PROGRAMS IN THE DRAFT HOUSING ELEMENT THAT CAME 
20:05:41 OUT OF THIS ANALYSIS.

20:05:44 >> THANK YOU, WAYLAND.

20:05:45 GOOD EVENING, CITY  COUNCILMEMBERS.

20:05:50 MY PORTION OF THE PRESENTATION IS GOING TO HIGHLIGHT NOTABLE NEW POLICIES FROM 
20:05:52 THE DRAFT HOUSING ELEMENT.

20:05:56 AS WELL AS REVIEW OUR HOUSING SITES INVENTORY.

20:06:00 SO I'LL BEGIN BY HIGHLIGHTING KEY NEW PROGRAMS.

20:06:04 AGAIN, THESE ARE JUST A SMALL CROSS-SECTION OF THE 88 PROGRAMS THAT 
20:06:08 YOU CAN FIND IN ENTIRETY IN CHAPTER 2 OF OUR DRAFT HOUSING ELEMENT.

20:06:16 AS WAYLAND MENTIONED, REMOVING BARRIERS TO THE PRODUCTION OF AFFORDABLE 
20:06:19 HOUSING IS A KEY THEME THAT WE HEARD DURING COMMUNITY OUTREACH.

20:06:24 AND RESULTANTLY, IT'S A KEY POLICY GOAL THAT IS REALLY PRESENT THROUGHOUT OUR 
20:06:25 HOUSING ELEMENT.

20:06:31 THE HOUSING ELEMENT INCORPORATES KEY POLICY DECISIONS THAT THIS COUNCIL HAS 
20:06:34 ALREADY MADE TO FURTHER AFFORDABLE HOUSING PRODUCTION.

20:06:41 THIS INCLUDES COUNCIL'S RECENT AND SIGNIFICANT DECISION TO CUT TRAFFIC, 
20:06:46 PARKLAND AND PARK FACILITY IMPACT FEES BY 50% FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING 
20:06:46 DEVELOPERS.

20:06:50 WHICH HAS BEEN INCORPORATED INTO OUR HOUSING ELEMENT AS PROGRAM 49.

20:06:59 THIS DECISION WILL SAVE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND ALLOW PUBLIC MONEY TO BE 
20:07:01 UTILIZED MORE EFFICIENTLY FOR THESE PROJECTS.

20:07:08 PROGRAM 57 HIGHLIGHTS ANOTHER EXISTING PROGRAM, WHICH IS  OFFERING SHORTENED 
20:07:10 BUILDING PERMIT REVIEW TIMES FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS.

20:07:16 THIS PROGRAM HELPS PROJECTS COMPLY WITH TIGHT TAX CREDIT DEADLINES, WHICH 
20:07:21 OFTEN MANDATE CONSTRUCTION BEGINNING WITHIN A FEW MONTHS OF RECEIVING A 
20:07:22 FINANCE AWARD.

20:07:27 FINALLY, THE HOUSING ELEMENT ALSO CREATES NEW PROGRAMS TO INCENTIVIZE 
20:07:28 AFFORDABLE HOUSING PRODUCTION.

20:07:35 PROGRAM 63 CALLS FOR PROACTIVE OUTREACH TO BRING AFFORDABLE HOUSING TO THE 
20:07:37 UNDERUTILIZED FREMONT BART PARKING LOT.

20:07:45 ANOTHER IMPORTANT THEME IS EXPANDING OPPORTUNITIES FOR PUBLIC INPUT IN 
20:07:48 HOUSING DEVELOPMENT.

20:07:52 PROGRAM 21 CALLS FOR THE  FORMALIZATION OF AN EXISTING PLANNING DIVISION 
20:07:57 PRACTICE TO ACTIVELY ENCOURAGE HOUSING DEVELOPERS TO CONNECT EARLY AND OFTEN 
20:07:59 COMMUNITY OUTREACH ON SIGNIFICANT PROJECTS.

20:08:07 OTHER PROGRAMS CALL FOR THE CITY TO OBTAIN PUBLIC INPUT ON ISSUES OF 
20:08:11 HOUSING AND DEVELOPMENT, SO PROGRAM 42, FOR EXAMPLE, REQUIRES CITY 
20:08:16 CONSULTATION WITH DEVELOPERS, HOUSING ADVOCATES, THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY, AND 
20:08:21 OTHER STAKEHOLDERS WHENEVER THERE ARE PROPOSED HOUSING POLICY CHANGES.

20:08:27 AND FINALLY, PROGRAM 61 WOULD HAVE STAFF EXPLORE DIFFERENT  WAYS TO 
20:08:30 PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR LOW INCOME RESIDENTS OF THE CITY TO PROVIDE 
20:08:34 FEEDBACK ON THE FUNDING OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS WITHIN FREMONT.

20:08:43 FINALLY, THE DRAFT HOUSING ELEMENT CONTAINS MORE THAN 10 PROGRAMS TO 
20:08:47 MAINTAIN CONSISTENCY WITH STATEHOUSING LAWS, WHICH HAVE BEEN VERY QUICKLY 
20:08:49 CHANGING OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS.

20:08:55 IN PARTICULAR, THERE ARE NEW REQUIREMENTS FOR DEVELOPMENTS THAT ARE 
20:09:01 PROPOSED ON SITES THAT ARE, YOU KNOW, PRESENT IN OUR SITES INVENTORY.

20:09:09 SO PROGRAM 16 WOULD CODIFY STATE LAWS THAT REQUIRE THE REPLACEMENT OF UNITS 
20:09:14 AFFORDABLE TO THE SAME OR LOWER INCOME LEVELS AS A CONDITION OF ANY 
20:09:19 DEVELOPMENT ON A NON-VACANT SITE WITH EXISTING RESIDENTIAL UNITS THAT IS 
20:09:21 IDENTIFIED WITHIN THE SITE'S INVENTORY.

20:09:29 PROGRAM 44 WOULD IMPLEMENT STATE LAW THAT REQUIRES BY RIGHT APPROVAL OF ANY 
20:09:35 HOUSING  DEVELOPMENT THAT INCLUDES 20% OF THE UNITS AS HOUSING AFFORDABLE TO 
20:09:37 VERY LOW AND LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS.

20:09:43 ON SITES THAT ARE BEING USED TO MEET THE SIXTH CYCLE RHNA THAT WERE ALSO 
20:09:47 PREVIOUSLY IDENTIFIED IN THE PAST TWO HOUSING ELEMENT CYCLES.

20:09:54 OTHER PROGRAMS CALL FOR THE CITY TO MODIFY THE ZONING ORDINANCE FOR 
20:09:56 CONSISTENCY WITH STATE REQUIREMENTS FOR PARTICULAR  USES.

20:10:03 THESE PROGRAMS DON'T ACTUALLY CHANGE THE UNDERLYING REGULATIONS BECAUSE THE 
20:10:08 STATE REGULATIONS ALREADY TAKE PRECEDENCE OVER THE CITY CODE.

20:10:14 HOWEVER, UPDATING THE CITY CODE WILL MAKE IT EASIER FOR CITY STAFF, FOR 
20:10:20 NON-PROFITS, AND FOR ADVOCATES TO UNDERSTAND HOW REGULATIONS APPLY TO 
20:10:23 THESE TYPES OF SPECIAL FACILITIES IN  FREMONT.

20:10:29 NOW OVERALL, THE PROGRAMS I'VE MENTIONED ARE JUST A SMALL NUMBER OF 
20:10:33 THE 88 PROGRAMS INCLUDED IN OUR DRAFT HOUSING ELEMENT, AND WE ENCOURAGE 
20:10:36  EVERYONE, COUNCIL AND MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO READ THROUGH THE POLICY 
20:10:40 PROGRAMS IN THEIR ENTIRETY IN CHAPTER 2 OF OUR DRAFT.

20:10:50 THE OTHER COMPONENT THAT I'LL BE REVIEWING TODAY IS THE SITES INVENTORY 
20:10:55 ANALYSIS, INVENTORY OF LAND SUITABLE FOR RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT IN FREMONT 
20:10:58 INCLUDING VACANT SITES AND SITES THAT HAVE THE POTENTIAL FOR REDEVELOPMENT.

20:11:03 SITES IN THE INVENTORY ARE LOCATED THROUGHOUT THE CITY.

20:11:09 AS YOU CAN SEE ON THE CLIPPED MAPS ON THIS SLIDE, AND LARGER VERSIONS OF 
20:11:11 THESE MAPS ARE INCLUDED IN CHAPTER 8 OF THE DRAFT HOUSING ELEMENT.

20:11:20 THIS TABLE SHOWS THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE SITES THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED IN 
20:11:21 OUR INVENTORY TO THE RHNA.

20:11:27 NOW SITE ARE CATEGORIZED AS LOW, MODERATE, OR ABOVE MODERATE INCOME 
20:11:33 SITES, BASED ON THEIR SIZE AND THE MINIMUM DENSITYS THAT THEY CAN SUPPORT.

20:11:40 SO THE ASSUMPTION IS THAT SITES WITH A DENSITY OF OVER 30  DWELLING UNITS PER 
20:11:49 ACRE THAT ARE BETWEEN A HALF ACRE AND 10-ACRE IN SIZE CAN SUPPORT TO THE  
20:11:51 LOWEST INCOME MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY.

20:11:56 SMALLER SITES WHICH ARE UNDER A HALF ACRE BUT WHICH HAVE THOSE LARGER 
20:12:01 DENSITIES ARE PRESUMED TO ACCOMMODATE MODERATE INCOME UNITS, AND THEN 
20:12:07 FINALLY, SITES THAT MAY BE AT A LOWER DENSITY THAN 30 UNITS PER ACRE ARE 
20:12:11 THOSE THAT ARE CATEGORIZED AS ABOVE MODERATE INCOME SITES.

20:12:20 THE IDENTIFIED HOUSING SITES INCLUDE PIPELINE DEVELOPMENTS, ADU PROJECTION, 
20:12:23 AS WELL AS VACANT OR UNDERUTILIZED SITES.

20:12:28 SO PIPELINE DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS ARE THROWS SPECIFIC PROJECTS THAT HAVE 
20:12:31 EITHER A PENDING OR APPROVED DEVELOPMENT APPLICATION SUBMITTED TO 
20:12:31 THE CITY.

20:12:39 YOU'LL NOTICE THAT THESE SITES COMPRISE A LARGE PORTION OF THE IDENTIFIED 
20:12:43 ABOVE MODERATE INCOME SITES IN PARTICULAR.

20:12:48 PROJECTED ADU DEVELOPMENT IS ALSO FACTORED IN TO THE SITE'S INVENTORY.

20:12:54 FOR THIS HOUSING ELEMENT CYCLE, THE ASSOCIATION OF BAY AREA GOVERNMENTS 
20:12:59 ANALYZED RENTAL DATA ON ADUs IN THE REGION, AND ACTUALLY PREPARED AN 
20:13:05 ANALYSIS TO SUPPORT ASSUMPTIONS ON THE AFFORDABILITY LEVELS OF ADUs.

20:13:11 AND UNDER THESE ASSUMPTIONS, 60% OF ADU DEVELOPMENTS WOULD BE CONSIDERED 
20:13:13 AFFORDABLE, LOW INCOME UNITS.

20:13:18 30% WOULD BE CONSIDERED AFFORDABLE MODERATE INCOME  UNITS, AND 10% WOULD 
20:13:21 BE ABOVE MODERATE OR MARKET RATE UNITS.

20:13:30 THESE ASSUMPTIONS, IF THEY ARE CERTIFIED BY HCD, WOULD ALLOW FREMONT 
20:13:35 TO COUNT ADUs TOWARDS OUR LOW AND -- AND ALSO EVENTUALLY COUNT THEM TOWARDS 
20:13:36 OUR RHNA PROGRESS.

20:13:43 FINALLY, THE LAST TWO ROWS IN THE TABLE SHOW THE TOTAL UNIT CAPACITY OF 
20:13:47 IDENTIFIED VACANT AND UNDERUTILIZED SITES.

20:13:50 AS YOU CAN SEE, THESE SITES MAKE UP THE BULK OF THE SITES THAT COUNT TOWARDS 
20:13:51 OUR INVENTORY.

20:13:58 NOTABLY, IN LINE WITH RECOMMENDATIONS FROM LCD, THE CITY HAS PLANNED 
20:14:04 SPECIFICALLY FOR MORE LOW INCOME QUALIFIED SITES THAN WERE OVERALL 
20:14:05 REQUIRED TO MEET THE RHNA.

20:14:13 AND SO THIS BUFFER WILL ENSURE THAT THE CITY DOESN'T HAVE TO REZONE OR 
20:14:15 REIDENTIFY SITES THROUGHOUT THE PLANNING PERIOD.

20:14:21 THE CITY HAS IDENTIFIED FEWER EXTRA SITES IN THE ABOVE MODERATE INCOME 
20:14:28 CATEGORIES BECAUSE SUCH A LARGE PORTION OF THAT DEVELOPMENT IS ACCOMMODATED 
20:14:30 THROUGH PIPELINE PROJECTS THAT ARE ALREADY PROPOSED OR FURTHER ALONG IN 
20:14:35 DEVELOPMENT THAN JUST A VACANT OR UNDERUTILIZED SITE THAT DOES NOT HAVE 
20:14:37 ANY PARTICULAR DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY PROPOSED.

20:14:46 THE CITY SITE PLAN INVENTORY HOUSING IN AREAS OF HIGH OPPORTUNITY, WHERE EVEN 
20:14:51 THE  LOWEST INCOME RESIDENTS HAVE ACCESS TO EDUCATION, EMPLOYMENT, AND A 
20:14:52 HEALTHY ENVIRONMENT.

20:14:58 THESE HIGH OPPORTUNITY AREAS ALSO SCORE BETTER IN STATE FUNDING CRITERIA FOR 
20:14:59 AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS.

20:15:05 THEREFORE, FURTHER MAXIMIZING THE FUNDING CHANCES FOR PROJECTS THAT ARE 
20:15:06 IN FREMONT.

20:15:11 ADDITIONALLY, 75% OF INVENTORY SITES ARE LOCATED WITHIN PRIORITY 
20:15:13 DEVELOPMENT AREAS.

20:15:18 WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH THE GENERAL PLAN'S VISION FOR STRATEGIC AND 
20:15:20 TRANSIT-ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT.

20:15:26 FINALLY, 65% OF PLANNED UNITS ARE ON THIS HIGHER DENSITY LOW AND MODERATE 
20:15:31 INCOME QUALIFIED SITES, WHICH IS IN LINE WITH THE CITY'S GENERAL 
20:15:32 PRIORITIZATION OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING OPTIONS.

20:15:40 LOOKING FORWARD, TONIGHT'S PRESENTATION IS REALLY INTENDED TO KICK OFF THE 
20:15:44 HOUSING ELEMENT REVIEW PROCESS FOR THIS SOLID DRAFT THAT IS NOW OUT FOR PUBLIC 
20:15:44 REVIEW.

20:15:51 AND THAT REVIEW PERIOD WILL RUN FOR 30 DAYS, WHICH IS THROUGH AUGUST 8TH, 
20:15:51 2022.

20:15:57 AT THAT POINT, STAFF WILL INCORPORATE PUBLIC COMMENT INTO THE DRAFT DOCUMENT 
20:16:01 AND THEN SUBMIT THAT REVISED DOCUMENT FOR HCD'S REVIEW.

20:16:06 WE'LL CONTINUE TO PURSUE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT OPPORTUNITIES EVEN AFTER 
20:16:08 THE CLOSE OF THE FORMAL PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD.

20:16:13 AND WE'LL COMBINE THE COMMENTS THAT WE RECEIVED FROM HCD AND THE COMMENTS WE 
20:16:19 CONTINUE TO RECEIVE FROM THE PUBLIC INTO A FINAL DRAFT FOR CITY COUNCIL 
20:16:20 CONSIDERATION AND ADOPTION.

20:16:27 WE NEED TO SUBMIT A DRAFT HOUSING ELEMENT TO HCD FOR REVIEW BY JANUARY 
20:16:30 OF 2023 IN ORDER TO REMAIN IN COMPLIANCE WITH STATE REQUIREMENTS.

20:16:37 SO AS A NEXT STEP, WE ENCOURAGE EVERYONE TO REVIEW THE DRAFT HOUSING 
20:16:41 ELEMENT IN OUR WEBSITE AT FREMONT.GOV/HOUSINGELEMENT.

20:16:45 IF YOU HAVE COMMENTS, MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC CAN EMAIL THEM TO 
20:16:50 HOUSINGELEMENT@FREMONT.GOV FOR STAFF CONSIDERATION AND  RESPONSE.

20:16:54 WHILE WE DEFINITELY ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO SUBMIT THEIR COMMENTS AND COMPLETE 
20:16:59 THEIR REVIEW BEFORE AUGUST 8TH SO THEY'RE INCORPORATED INTO THE DRAFT WE 
20:17:03 SUBMIT TO HCD, WE WILL CONTINUE TO ACCEPT COMMENTS ON THE DOCUMENT FROM 
20:17:08 NOW THROUGH ADOPTION, AND SO WE REALLY ENCOURAGE EVERYONE TO GO AND READ 
20:17:12 THROUGH THE DOCUMENT AND SUBMIT COMMENTS AS THEY'RE INTERESTED.

20:17:18 THAT CONCLUDES OUR PRESENTATION FOR THIS EVENING.

20:17:21 WAYLAND, MYSELF AND OTHER MEMBERS OF COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT STAFF ARE 
20:17:23 AVAILABLE FOR ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS THAT YOU MAY HAVE.

20:17:23 THANK YOU.

20:17:30 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

20:17:35 AND I'LL TURN THIS OVER TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY CLARIFYING QUESTIONS AT 
20:17:36 THIS TIME FROM THE COUNCIL.

20:17:43 I HAVE COUNCILMEMBER KENG.

20:17:45 >> Councilmember Keng: YES, MADAME MAYOR.

20:17:46 THANK YOU SO MUCH.

20:17:51 SO FIRST I WANT TO RECOGNIZE AND THANK THE STAFF FOR THEIR TREMENDOUS EFFORTS 
20:17:54 IN THE MANY EVENTS AND COMMUNITY MEETINGS THAT HAVE BEEN HELD TO REACH 
20:17:56 THE COMMUNITY.

20:17:59 I DO HAVE I THINK MAYBE THREE QUESTIONS.

20:18:05 FIRST IS HAVE WE LOOKED AT WHETHER WE HAVE ENOUGH STAFFING AT PLANNING SO 
20:18:08 THAT WE CAN AVOID OR REDUCE ANY DELAYS?

20:18:15 I KNOW THAT IN LAST COUPLE YEARS DURING THE PANDEMIC, A LOT OF RESIDENTS HAVE 
20:18:21 BEEN REMODELING THEIR HOME SO THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF ACTIVITIES, BUT MOVING 
20:18:29 FORWARD, I KNOW THAT FOR ALL PROJECTS, ANY DELAYS FOR -- AT EACH OF THE 
20:18:34 PLANNING CHECK  STAGE, IT WOULD NOT ADD UP AND MAKE THE PROJECTS MORE COSTLY 
20:18:38 AND SPECIFICALLY FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS, THOSE DOLLARS WON'T GO AS 
20:18:42 FAR, SO THAT'S MY FIRST QUESTION, WHETHER WE HAVE ENOUGH STAFFING AT 
20:18:42 PLANNING.

20:18:51 SECOND IS -- MAYBE I'LL SHARE ALL MY QUESTIONS AND THEN STAFF CAN REVIEW OR 
20:18:51 TAKE THE COMMENTS.

20:19:03 AND THEN SECOND IS FOR THE ADU REVIEW, FOR THE PROGRESS OF NUMBERS MAYBE 
20:19:07 BEING BUILT, IS IT CORRECT THAT -- DID I READ IT CORRECT, THE REVIEW IS AT 
20:19:13 HALF OF, YOU KNOW, THE NEXT EIGHT YEARS, AND I WONDER IF WE SHOULD MAKE 
20:19:20 IT SOONER THAN THE FOUR YEARS, MARK, AND IF WE HAVE -- IF WE WOULD HAVE 
20:19:26 SPECIFIC MEASURES THAT WOULD KICK IN IF THEY'RE NOT PRODUCING AT THE ESTIMATED 
20:19:27 NUMBER.

20:19:37 AND THAT MAY BE THE LAST QUESTION WOULD BE -- THE CURRENT ANALYSIS, A LOT OF 
20:19:43 ANALYSTS ARE EXPECTING A TWO TO THREE YEARS OF ECONOMIC DOWNTURN, WHICH 
20:19:47 WOULD LIKELY DECREASE HOUSING PRODUCTION, AND I THINK WE WOULD NEED 
20:19:51 A PLAN TO BRIDGE THAT GAP, SO THAT'S ALL MY QUESTIONS.

20:19:51 THANK YOU.

20:20:01 >> Mr. Schoenholz: SO I'LL TAKE THE FIRST QUESTION, WHICH HAD TO DO WITH 
20:20:03 THE STAFFING CAPACITY TO PROCESS AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS.

20:20:13 AND WE ACTUALLY HAVE A VERY GOOD RECORD OF HELPING AFFORDING HOUSING 
20:20:20 DEVELOPERS MEET THE VERY STRINGENT TIME LINES THAT THEY HAVE IMPOSED BY THE 
20:20:22 STATE WITH TAX CREDIT FINANCING.

20:20:25 THEY ONLY HAVE ABOUT SIX MONTHS TO TURN AROUND THE PROJECT AND GET IT 
20:20:26 PERMITTED.

20:20:32 AND THAT'S A QUICK TURNAROUND TIME FOR A BIG MULTIFAMILY PROJECT LIKE THAT.

20:20:38 SO WE HAVE ACTUALLY ACCELERATED TIMELINES FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING 
20:20:42 PROJECTS AND WE'VE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN MEETING THOSE.

20:20:50 OBVIOUSLY THE NUMBERS IN THIS HOUSING ELEMENT CYCLE ARE  BIGGER, SO WE'LL 
20:20:57 SEE IF WE DO GET A LARGE INCREASE IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT COMING 
20:21:01 THROUGH THE PIPELINE, WE'LL NEED TO STAFF UP SOME MORE OF THESE 
20:21:05 CONTRACTORS TO HELP US DEAL WITH THE INCREASED VOLUME, BUT IN THE SHORT 
20:21:11 TERM, I'M CONFIDENT WE CAN HANDLE THE FLOW AND WE CONTINUALLY KIND OF 
20:21:15 MONITOR THE WORKLOAD AND ADD STAFF OR CONTRACT RESOURCES AS NECESSARY.

20:21:24 >> Councilmember Keng: WONDERFUL , THANK YOU.

20:21:31 >> SO THE SECOND QUESTION WAS REGARDING THE CHECKING OF THE PROGRESS OF 
20:21:35  OF ADU PRODUCTION.

20:21:43 WE WILL BE -- ON ANY BASIS BUT THE PROGRAM THAT WE'RE PROPOSING THE HOUSE.

20:21:50  -- HALFWAY THROUGH THE CYCLE, WHAT WE COULD DO TO POTENTIALLY FACILITATE 
20:21:53 PRODUCTION IF WE'RE FALLING SHORT OF EXPECTATIONS.

20:21:59 NOW THERE IS A PROGRAM TO TAKE SOME STEPS RIGHT OFF THE BAT TO FACILITATE 
20:22:07 ADU PRODUCTION, SO WHEN WE DO KIND OF IN THE MID CYCLE TIME PERIOD, MAYBE IT 
20:22:11 WILL BE -- THERE WILL BE SOMETHING ELSE WE DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO NOW OR 
20:22:20 SOME FRESH IDEA AT THAT POINT, BUT WE ARE TAKING MEASURES IMMEDIATELY TO -- 
20:22:21 FOR ADU PRODUCTION.

20:22:26 REGARDING THE POTENTIAL FOR ECONOMIC DOWNTURN, THAT'S A POTENTIALLY 
20:22:32 SIGNIFICANT CONSTRAINT TO HOUSING  PRODUCTION, AND NOT SOMETHING THAT THE 
20:22:37 CITY OF FREMONT CAN NECESSARILY CONTROL, BUT WE CAN FACILITATE THE 
20:22:45 PRODUCTION OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND WE CAN FACILITATE OUR HOUSING GOALS IN 
20:22:49 MANY OTHER AREAS AS DOCUMENTED IN OUR HOUSING ELEMENT.

20:22:52 SO WE'LL BE ENDEAVORING TO DO THAT.

20:22:57 >> Councilmember Keng: GREAT.

20:23:00 THANKS SO MUCH, WAYLAND.

20:23:03 >> Mayor Mei: VICE MAYOR SALWAN, CLARIFYING QUESTIONS.

20:23:04 >> Vice Mayor Salwan: THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR.

20:23:08 I WANT TO COMMEND STAFF, I THINK THEY'VE REALLY OUTDONE THEMSELVES THIS 
20:23:09 TIME.

20:23:13 I'VE SEEN MANY A HOUSING ELEMENT AND THEY'RE USUALLY PRETTY DRY, AND I LIKE 
20:23:17 TO SEE SOME OF THE TEETH AND SOME OF THE SPECIFICS THAT STAFF HAS TAKEN 
20:23:19 INITIATIVE, SO I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT.

20:23:23 I KNOW WE'RE KIND OF THE NERDS OF PLANNING, BUT I REALLY APPRECIATE ALL 
20:23:24 THE THINGS THAT WE'RE DOING.

20:23:30 I NOTICED THERE WAS INCREASED EMPHASIS ON ADU, WHICH I STRONGLY SUPPORT.

20:23:35 DOES THE ADU NUMBERS TODAY, DO WE KNOW IF THEY ACCOUNT FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING 
20:23:37 YET OR DO YOU GUYS KNOW?

20:23:47 >> ULTIMATELY HCD WILL HAVE TO SIGN OFF ON IT, BUT THE ANALYSIS THAT WE'VE PUT 
20:23:57 FORWARD TO COUNT IT AS SOMETHING THAT'S AFFORDABLE, SOMETHING THAT HELPS 
20:24:03 FACILITATE AS A REGION TO ANALYZE THE AFFORDABILITY OF  ADUs OVERALL IN THE 
20:24:08 REGION, SO US ALONG WITH OUR PEERS ARE  MOVING FORWARD WITH THIS METHODOLOGY, 
20:24:14 BUT AGAIN, ULTIMATELY HCD WILL NEED TO CONCUR WITH OUR ANALYSIS.

20:24:15 >> Vice Mayor Salwan: THANK YOU SO MUCH.

20:24:23 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

20:24:29 I WOULD LOVE TO GO TO THE  PUBLIC, I'LL OPEN THE PUBLIC COMMENT FOR THIS, AND 
20:24:32 I SEE THE PUBLIC SPEAKERS.

20:24:34 LISA DANZ?

20:24:36 WHEN WE FINISH THIS, WE MIGHT HAVE TO TAKE A BREAK.

20:24:37 LISA DANZ, THANK YOU.

20:24:38 >> SURE.

20:24:42 THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE HARD WORK ON THE HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATE AND FOR THE 
20:24:43 OPPORTUNITY TO COMMENT ON IT.

20:24:48 SO THIS IS A LONG AND TECHNICAL DOCUMENT, I'VE PUT SOME MORE DETAILED 
20:24:51 COMMENTS IN WRITING AND I'LL CONTINUE SENDING MORE AS I GET A CHAPS TO READ 
20:24:52 IN MORE DETAIL.

20:24:58 FOR NOW I'LL KEEP A HIGH LEVEL WITH THE CAVEAT THERE WILL BE ITEMS I'LL 
20:25:01 UNDERSTAND MORE WHEN I READ IT MORE THOROUGHLY.

20:25:06 OVERALL WE KNOW WE HAVEN'T BUILT AS MUCH AS THE RHNA NUMBERS SPECIFY, SO 
20:25:11 WE REALLY SHOULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS HOUSING ELEMENT TO GO AS FAR AS 
20:25:15 POSSIBLE AND I DO BELIEVE THERE'S ROOM TO UPDATE THIS DRAFT TO BE A STRONGER 
20:25:16 TOOL TO HELP US DO SO.

20:25:21 SO FOR EXAMPLE, WITH THE LIKELIHOOD OF DEVELOPMENT, I'M A LITTLE CONCERNED IN 
20:25:25 THAT CHART THAT COURTNEY JUST SHOWED A FEW MINUTES AGO THAT SO MANY OF THE 
20:25:30 LOW INCOME SITES RELY ON REDEVELOPING SITES THAT ALREADY HAVE AN EXISTING 
20:25:31 USE.

20:25:38 I'M NOT TOTALLY CONVINCED THAT  A -- WOULD BE REDEVELOPED IN PRACTICE.

20:25:42 I'M ALSO CONCERNED THAT THE  BUFFERS IN THAT CHART ASSUME A HIGHER PERCENTAGE 
20:25:47 OF ACTUAL BUILD THAN WE SAW IN LAST CYCLE FOR THE LOWER INCOME LEVELS, 
20:25:51 WHERE WE BUILT -- IF I REMEMBER CORRECTLY, LESS THAN HALF OF THE UNITS 
20:25:59 AND THE BUFFER WAS, YOU KNOW, NOT A DOUBLING OF THE PROJECTED -- OF THE 
20:26:01 NEEDED NUMBER OF UNITS.

20:26:08 SO THOSE ARE SOME SORT OF LIKELIHOOD OF DEVELOPMENT  ISSUES.

20:26:19 I WONDER IF WE COULD GET A  BETTER IDEA ANALYZING HOW MANY GOT -- WHETHER IT 
20:26:24 REQUIRED REDEVELOPMENT OF A SITE THAT ALREADY HAD AN EXISTING USE.

20:26:31 AND THEN FOR ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF HOW TO STRENGTHEN THE PLAN, I THINK THAT 
20:26:37 SUBSTANTIAL ZONING UPDATES SHOULD BE ON THE TABLE TO ENCOURAGE MORE DENSITY 
20:26:39 WHICH CAN ENCOURAGE MORE  AFFORDABILITY.

20:26:46 THE MAIN PLACE I SAW WAS WHEN IT WAS REPORTING OUT ON THE COMMUNITY INPUT 
20:26:49 WHERE THE COMMUNITY MEMBERS WERE SAYING THAT WE SHOULD DO THAT.

20:26:52 LIKE I SAID, I HOPE TO HAVE MORE SUGGESTIONS IN THE FUTURE BEFORE THE 
20:26:56 AUGUST 8TH DEADLINE, AND I UNDERSTAND THIS IS EXPECTED TO GO IN FRONT OF THE 
20:26:58 PLANNING COMMISSION LATER THIS MONTH AND I'M WONDERING IF IT'S GOING TO 
20:27:02 COME BEFORE THE CITY COUNCIL AGAIN TOO, BECAUSE I'M GUESSING THAT I'M NOT THE 
20:27:08 ONLY PERSON WHO HASN'T HAD A CHANCE TO CAREFULLY READ ALL 440 PAGES SINCE IT 
20:27:12 WAS RELEASED TO THE PUBLIC AND THE COUNCIL MAY HAVE MORE TO SAY AFTER 
20:27:15 WE'VE HAD MORE OF A CHANCE TO GO THROUGH IT AND SHARE OUR IDEAS.

20:27:16 THANK YOU.

20:27:16 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

20:27:22 NEXT SPEAKER I HAVE IS KENNETH DO.

20:27:30 >> GOOD EVENING, MAYOR AND COUNCILMEMBERS.

20:27:35 MY NAME IS KENNETH DO, FIELD REPRESENTATIVE FOR THE CARPENTERS 
20:27:41 UNION LOCAL 713, REPRESENTING 36,000 MEMBERS IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AND 
20:27:44 APPROXIMATELY 352 MEMBERS IN FREMONT.

20:27:49 HOUSING ELEMENT IS GREAT BECAUSE IT PROVIDES HOUSING FOR ALL INCOME LEVELS 
20:27:53 AND BENEFITS THE PEOPLE THAT WANT TO LIVE AND WORK IN FREMONT.

20:27:59 HOWEVER, BEFORE GRANTING THIS APPROVAL, THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME REQUIREMENTS 
20:28:00 FOR THE HOUSING ELEMENT.

20:28:06 A COMMITMENT TO AN APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM TO GUARANTEE WE HAVE 
20:28:10 EXPERIENCE TO COMPLETE A HIGH QUALITY PROJECT IN A SAFE AND TIMELY MANNER.

20:28:15 A LIVABLE WAGE WITH MEDICAL AND RETIRED -- RETIREMENT BENEFITS THAT ALLOWS 
20:28:18 WORKERS AND THEIR FAMILIES TO LIVE IN THE COMMUNITY THEY WORK IN.

20:28:24 THIS ALSO MEANS THOSE WAGES WILL BE REINVESTED BACK INTO THE LOCAL 
20:28:30 COMMUNITY AS THEY SPEND THEIR EARNINGS AND THEIR TAX DOLLARS WILL HELP FUND 
20:28:31 SCHOOLS AND GOVERNMENT.

20:28:38 PROJECTS THAT INVEST IN APPRENTICESHIP, PREVAILING WAGE, HEALTHCARE, ARE THE 
20:28:41 BEST FOR WORKERS AND THE COMMUNITY.

20:28:45 WE BELIEVE THE HOUSING ELEMENT WITH THE PREQUALIFICATION LANGUAGE WILL HELP 
20:28:49 EASE THE HOUSING BURDEN WE ALL FACE.

20:28:53 IN CLOSING, FOR ALL THESE REASONS, THE CARPENTER URGES THE CITY OF FREMONT 
20:28:57 ADOPT THESE LABOR STANDARDS AS A REQUIREMENT FOR THE HOUSING ELEMENT.

20:28:58 THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.

20:29:01 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

20:29:03 NEXT SPEAKER IS KELLY ABREU.

20:29:11 >> THANK YOU.

20:29:13 THE HOUSING ELEMENT IS AN ELEMENT OF WHAT?

20:29:15 IT'S AN ELEMENT OF THE GENERAL PLAN.

20:29:21 AND THE GENERAL PLAN IS REQUIRED TO BE INTERNALLY CONSISTENT, MEANING ANY -- 
20:29:28 I'M READING THIS FROM A STATE WEBSITE,  STATEHOUSING DEPARTMENT, ANY AND ALL 
20:29:35 CONFLICTS IN THE GENERAL PLAN ELEMENT SHOULD BE -- YOU LOOK AT MISSION SAN 
20:29:41 JOSÉ, THEY HAVE LIKE RED SPLOTCHES FOR TOWN CENTERS, FOR MEDIUM AND HIGH 
20:29:47  HIGH-DENSITY HOUSING, AND THAT'S NOT UTILIZED IN THIS HOUSING ELEMENT, AT 
20:29:47 ALL.

20:29:53 BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT THE PROPOSED HOUSING ELEMENT, IT JUST ONE LONG LINE 
20:29:58 ALONG FREMONT BOULEVARD AND THEN A LITTLE SIDE BLOB AROUND THE DOWNTOWN.

20:30:01 SO WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

20:30:04 WHAT IS THE OUTCOME OF THIS HOUSING ELEMENT GOING TO BE?

20:30:07 WELL, IT'S GOING TO BE -- LET'S SAY YOU PUT ALL THE HOUSING WHERE YOU SAY 
20:30:08 YOU'RE GOING TO PUT IT.

20:30:18 THAT MEANS YOU'RE GOING TO OVERLOOK, YOU'RE GOING TO SKIP OR FORGET NILES.

20:30:21 NOW MISSION SAN JOSÉ IS A BASKET CASE.

20:30:26 IT'S PROBABLY DEAD ALREADY, THE TOWN CENTER THERE.

20:30:29 , BECAUSE OF THIS, BECAUSE OF LACK OF  HOUSING.

20:30:32 NOT BECAUSE OF LACK OF COMMERCE, YOU KNOW.

20:30:36 YOU'VE GOT AN EMPTY STARBUCKS, YOU'VE GOT AN EMPTY BANK OF AMERICA, YOU'VE 
20:30:41 GOT AN EMPTY MCIVOR'S HARDWARE, YOU'VE GOT AN EMPTY EVERYTHING OVER THERE SO 
20:30:42 THERE'S PLENTY OF SPACE.

20:30:48 IT'S JUST THAT THIS CITY HAS KILLED MISSION SAN JOSÉ BY NOT DEVELOPING IT.

20:30:49 NILES, SAME THING.

20:30:51 IT'S NOT PART OF THIS PLAN.

20:30:55 AND THEN WHAT ABOUT ALL THE PROJECTS THAT YOU'RE FAILING TO DEVELOP?

20:30:59 THERE'S THIS GIANT EMPTY LOT IN THE MIDDLE OF CENTERVILLE THAT WAS 
20:31:00 SUPPOSED TO BE BUILT AS HOUSING.

20:31:04 IT'S STILL -- IT'S COMPLETELY FLAT LAST I CHECKED.

20:31:06 EMPTY DIRT.

20:31:13 WHAT ABOUT THAT GIANT HOUSING PROJECT AT THE CORNER OF 680 AND DURHAM ROAD?

20:31:15 IT'S ON THE NORTHEAST CORNER.

20:31:17 IT'S STAGNANT.

20:31:20 IT'S NOT -- THEY HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING TO THAT FOR YEARS.

20:31:31 A LARGE NUMBER OF THIRPTION IN THE PIPELINE, 90 UNITS OF HOUSING ON 
20:31:35 OSGOOD ROAD NEAR IRVINGTON, THAT'S JUST SITTING THERE, IT'S HALF BUILT BUT 
20:31:36 NOBODY HAS THE MONEY TO FINISH IT.

20:31:40 AND IS THE CITY COUNTING ITS EGGS BEFORE THEY'RE HATCHED?

20:31:43 IT TAKES A LONG TIME TO HATCH THESE THINGS, AND WHEN THESE THINGS DON'T 
20:31:49 GET HATCHED, COULD DO YOU SUBTRACT, NOT JUST ADD?

20:31:54 ALSO WE HEARD SOMETHING ABOUT HOW THE CITY ISN'T BUILDING, IF YOU LOOK AT 
20:32:01 THE NUMBERS, THE BOTTOM LINE NUMBER -- THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS OVERBUILDING, 
20:32:10 BUT THE CITY IS -- THE CITY IS -- CITIES IN THE BAY AREA AND ALAMEDA 
20:32:10 COUNTY.

20:32:10 THANK YOU.

20:32:18 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

20:32:24 THE LAST SPEAKER IS JOHN HINDS AND AFTER WHICH WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A 
20:32:26 BREAK BECAUSE WE'RE DUE FOR OUR STENOCAPTIONER.

20:32:27 >> GOOD EVENING, EVERYONE.

20:32:32 I'M SPEAKING ON THE REDUCED IMPACT FEES FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS.

20:32:37 IF I TRY TO TURN MY HOUSE INTO A GAS STATION OR A DISCO, IT REDUCES MY 
20:32:39 NEIGHBOR'S ABILITY TO ENJOY THEIR HOMES.

20:32:44 THEY CAN SMELL MY GAS FUMES, THEY CAN HEAR MY AWFUL MUSIC.

20:32:55 IF I TURN INTO MY 30-UNIT COMPLEX, IT ALSO -- CROWDING THE STREET, THE WATER 
20:32:58 LINES, THE SEWER LINES, EVERYBODY'S CABLE TV SERVICE AND SO ON.

20:33:05 BUT FORTUNATELY I CAN'T DO THAT BECAUSE OF ZONING LAWS.

20:33:09 WHEN BIGGER PROJECTS GO UP IN ALREADY BUILT UP PARTS OF TOWN, EVEN IF 
20:33:15 THEY'RE CONSISTENT WITH ZONING LAWS, THEY HAVE AN IMPACT ON THEIR NEIGHBORS 
20:33:19 DUE TO CROWDING AND THAT'S THE JUSTIFICATION FOR HAVING IMPACT FEES 
20:33:20 IN THE FIRST PLACE.

20:33:26 WE TALK ABOUT CROWDING SCHOOLS BUT WE HAVE EVERYTHING IN THE AREA.

20:33:30 WITH AFFORDABLE HOUSING, THE MOST STRAIGHTFORWARD WAY TO MAKE IT 
20:33:33 AFFORDABLE IS TO MAKE IT SMALLER, TO PACK MORE UNITS ON TO ONE SQUARE FOOT 
20:33:39 OF LAND, SO CLEARLY YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE AN EVEN GREATER ADVERSE IMPACT ON 
20:33:44 THE NEIGHBORS AND THE IMPACT FEE FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS SHOULD BE 
20:33:45 HIGHER, NOT LOWER.

20:33:51 AND SO THIS IDEA THAT WE HAVE THIS AWESOME PLAN TO MAKE IT EASIER TO MEET 
20:33:56 STATE MANDATE BY REDUCING THE FEE FOR THOSE, I THINK IS GETTING IT EXACTLY 
20:33:56 BACKWARD.

20:33:57 THANK YOU.

20:33:59 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

20:34:06 AND AT THIS TIME, I'M GOING TO CLOSE PUBLIC COMMENT AND WE'RE GOING TO 
20:34:09 PAUSE FOR A BREAK BEFORE WE RETURN TO THE COUNCIL FOR DISCUSSION.

20:34:14 WE ARE DUE A BREAK FOR OUR STENOCAPTIONER EVERY HOUR AND A HALF, 
20:34:17 SO I WANTED TO MAKE SURE, IF WE COULD JUST PAUSE, AND WE'LL RETURN IN 10 
20:34:18 MINUTES.

20:34:18 THANK YOU SO MUCH.

20:34:25 AND IF I COULD ASK EVERYONE TO PLEASE TURN OFF YOUR VIDEO AND MUTE YOUR MIC 
20:34:28 DURING THIS TIME PERIOD, THAT WOULD BE GREAT.

20:34:28 THANK YOU.

20:44:12 [ RECESS ]

20:44:16 >> Mayor Mei:   IF WE CAN START GETTING THE COUNCIL AND EVERYONE BACK THAT 
20:44:17 WOULD BE GREAT, THANK YOU.

20:44:33 AND AT THIS TIME WE'RE GOING TO RESUME ON THE COUNCIL COMMENTS AND DISCUSSION 
20:44:35 ON THE HOUSING ELEMENT.

20:45:01 PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS IS THE DRAFT.

20:45:15 I SEE COUNCILMEMBER SHAO'S HANDS RAISED PLEASE.

20:45:17 >> Councilmember Shao:   THANK YOU MAYOR.

20:45:21 STAFF THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR COME UP WITH THE DRAFT AND ALSO YOUR ONLINE 
20:45:24 GOING EFFORTS TO  OUTREACH TO THE COMMUNITY.

20:45:29 INDEED, THE RESIDENTS ENGAGEMENT IN THE PROCESS IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE 
20:45:35 CANNOT ONLY PASSIVELY RECEIVE THEIR FEEDBACK, WE CAN ALSO FRO ACTIVELY 
20:45:41  PRO ACTIVELY REACH OUT TO THEM FOR

20:45:48 SUGGESTIONS AND COLLABORATIONs PEP INDEED THE SITUATION IS REALLY HARSH 
20:45:52 IN TERMS OF THE AFFORDABILITY OF THE HOUSING AND WITHOUT ADDITIONAL FUNDING 
20:45:55 FROM THE STATE SUCH AS THE REDEVELOPMENT FUND FOR

20:46:03 THE CITY TO NOT ONLY PLAN, BUT ALSO TO FUND, AND SUPPORT SUCH LARGE AMOUNT OF 
20:46:10 HOUSING UNITS, AND MAKE SURE THEY'RE AFFORDABLE, IS A REALLY BIG STATISTIC.

20:46:14 WE ALL KNOW THAT WITH THE -- TASK.

20:46:19 WE ALL KNOW THAT WITH THE INFLATION AND ALSO THE POTENTIAL ECONOMIC RECESSION, 
20:46:22 RIGHT NOW THE INTEREST RATE IS ALREADY RAISED.

20:46:24 AND WILL BE RAISED FURTHER.

20:46:35 THAT WOULD INCREASE THE COST OF CAPITAL AND THEREFORE, THE HOUSING PRICE AS 
20:46:43 WELL AS THE -- THE HOUSING PRICE WILL BE HIGHER.

20:46:47 THE BUILDING COST WILL BE HIGHER, THE AFFORDABILITY FOR THE BUYER WILL BE 
20:46:48 LOWER.

20:46:53 BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO PAY HIGH AMOUNT OF INTEREST FOR THEIR LOANS AND 
20:46:53 MORTGAGES.

20:47:00 SO BESIDES, YOU KNOW, IT IS ALSO WE'VE HEARD THAT, YOU KNOW, THE LABOR 
20:47:09 REPRESENTATIVE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE CONSTRUCTION WORKERS BE PAID WELL, 
20:47:11 THAT WILL FURTHER INCREASE THE BUILDING COST.

20:47:20 SO TAKING ALL THOSE FACTORS INTO CONSIDERATION, WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS, 
20:47:29 CONTINUE TO ADVOCATE FOR OUR CITY, AT THE STATE LEVEL, TO MAKE SURE THAT 
20:47:35 STATE POLICY WOULD NOT ONLY BE ONE-SIDED, IN OTHER WORDS,

20:47:40  THEIR JOB IS NOT ONLY TO JUST TELL US HOW MANY UNITS TO BUILD BUT ALSO TO 
20:47:44 MAKE SURE THAT THEY PROVIDE FINANCIAL SUPPORT AS WELL.

20:47:53 ALSO, FREMONT HAS BEEN LEADING ALL THE BAY AREA CITIES IN TERMS OF BALANCING 
20:47:58 THE JOBS AND HOUSING, AND WE'RE PROUD OF  THAT.

20:48:06 AND WE'LL CONTINUE TO INCREASE JOB OPPORTUNITIES IN FREMONT, THEREFORE, 
20:48:13 NOT ONLY LOCAL ECONOMY WILL BE BETTER BUT ALSO, PEOPLE DO NOT HAVE TO TRAVEL 
20:48:19  FAR, OR FREMONT WOULD NOT HAVE TO UNFAIRLY BEAR

20:48:24 THE BURDEN OF PROVIDING HOUSING FOR OTHER CITIES IN FREMONT.

20:48:31 SO THIS IS ALSO AN ISSUE WHERE CITIES HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER.

20:48:37 IT'S AN ORIGINAL COLLABORATION ISSUE AND ALSO A CITY-STATE COLLABORATION 
20:48:45 ISSUE SO FOR THAT I FORESEE THAT GREAT EFFORTS HAVE TO BE MADE IN ORDER TO 
20:48:49 MAKE THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING ISSUE MITIGATED OR

20:48:51 EVENTUALLY  RESOLVED.

20:48:58 SO I WOULD THANK THE STAFF IN ADVANCE FOR YOUR FUTURE HARD WORK AND I ALSO 
20:49:05 ENCOURAGE THE RESIDENTS IN FREMONT TO FURTHER ENGAGE IN THE PROCESS, SO THAT 
20:49:07 WE CAN WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE FREMONT BETTER.

20:49:15 

20:49:18 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU COUNCILMEMBER SHAO.

20:49:21 NEXT IS COUNCILMEMBER KENG.

20:49:23 >> Councilmember Keng:   THANK YOU, MADAM MAYOR.

20:49:29 I WANT TO THANK STAFF IN THEIR TREMENDOUS EFFORTS, REACHING OUT TO 
20:49:37 THE COMMUNITY ESPECIALLY THOSE WITH SPECIAL HOUSING  NEEDS, AFFORDABLE 
20:49:39 HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS AS WELL AS TO DIFFERENT LOCAL

20:49:40 COMMUNITY.

20:49:40 >> DRUPS.

20:49:44   GROUPS.

20:49:48 I DO SPECIFICALLY LOOK FORWARD TO THE HOUSING EDUCATION CAMPAIGN THAT WAS 
20:49:53 MENTIONED IN PART OF THOSE -- PART OF THE POLICIES AND PROGRAMS THAT HAVE 
20:49:54 BEEN PROPOSED.

20:50:00 I KNOW THAT MANY RESIDENTS MAY NOT REALIZE OUR HOUSING NEEDS AS A 
20:50:08 GROWING, PART OF A GROWING REGION AND AFFORDABILITY, AND  SO, YOU KNOW, THE 
20:50:11 EDUCATION CAMPAIGN IS MUCH-NEEDED.

20:50:15 AND SO THAT OUR FUTURE PROJECTS CAN BE BETTER SUPPORTED BY THE COMMUNITY.

20:50:20 SO I DO ENCOURAGE, YOU KNOW, THE RESIDENTS TO CONTINUE TO COMMENT AND 
20:50:28 REACH OUT TO THE STAFF AND THE COUNCIL FOR THEIR COMMENTS AND FEEDBACK AND 
20:50:32 HOPEFULLY MOST OF OUR COMMENTS AND OUR PLAN CAN BE

20:50:36  ACCEPTED BY THE STRAIGHT.

20:50:36 THANK YOU SO MUCH.

20:50:38 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

20:50:42 NEXT IS VICE MAYOR SALWAN.

20:50:43 >> Councilmember Salwan:   THANK YOU, MADAM MAYOR.

20:50:46 I JUST -- TWO QUICK COMMENTS.

20:50:48 ONE WAS ABOUT MIDDLE-INCOME HOUSING.

20:50:51 I THINK THAT'S ONE THAT WE ALWAYS STRUGGLE WITH.

20:51:00 WE HAVE AFFORDABLE HOUSING WHICH YOU KNOW, UPPER MIDDLE CLASS.

20:51:06 SO ARE THERE ANY OPPORTUNITIES TO WORK ON MIDDLE INCOME  HOUSING, HOW WE CAN 
20:51:08 INCENTIVIZE THAT OR HELP TO FACILITATE THAT?

20:51:14 AND THESE ARE OUR TEACHERS, OUR FIREFIGHTERS OUR PEACE OFFICERS, 
20:51:23 NURSES, MANY OF THE COMMON PROFESSIONS.

20:51:28 >> I'M SORRY, I WAS JUST GOING TO TO VICE MAYOR SALWAN THAT THE MIDDLE 
20:51:35 INCOME CATEGORY HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN THE REALLY DIFFICULT ONE TO PROVIDE 
20:51:37 HOUSING FOR.

20:51:42 THERE TRNT SAME KIND OF SUBSIDY PROGRAMS AVAILABILITY TYPICALLY FOR 
20:51:48 MIDDLE-INCOME HOUSING THAT THERE ARE FOR YOU KNOW LOW AND VERY LOW INCOME 
20:51:49 HOUSING.

20:51:54 AND JET MIDDLE INCOME FOLKS CAN'T AFFORD MARKET RATE PRICES IN THE BAY 
20:51:55 AREA GENERALLY.

20:51:58 SO IT'S A CONTINUING CHALLENGE.

20:52:01 THERE ARE SOME MODELS OUT THERE THAT ARE BEING LOOKED AT.

20:52:06 YOU KNOW FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT SCHOOL TEACHERS, THERE IS STATE 
20:52:12 LEGISLATION THAT ALLOWS SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO SET  ASIDE SCHOOL LAND 
20:52:14 AND BUILD HOUSING FOR THEIR EMPLOYEES THERE.

20:52:19 SO SOME SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE STARTING TO GO DOWN THAT ROAD.

20:52:34 THERE'S ALSO AN INTERESTING MODEL THAT IS -- THAT ALLOWS A PURCHASE OF 
20:52:42 MARKET-RATE APARTMENT BUILDINGS, TO BUY PRIVATE ENTITIES, THEY CAN USE 
20:52:46 ACTUALLY TAX FREE BONDS WHICH ALLOWS THEM TO LOWER RENTS

20:52:53 ON THE PHARMACISTS, AND THEN THOSE RENTS CAN BE TARGETED AT MODERATE 
20:52:55 INCOME OR JUST ABOUT MODERATE INCOME.

20:52:59 THAT'S A NEW MODEL AND THERE ARE A LOT OF SORT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT THE DETAILS 
20:52:59 OF IT.

20:53:06 BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'VE HEARD ABOUT A COUPLE OF FOLKS HAVE 
20:53:11 APPROACHED US ABOUT IT AND WE'RE SORT OF -- WE'RE REALLY WAITING FOR THE 
20:53:15 STATE TO SET SOME PARAMETERS AROUND THE PROGRAM SO THAT IT'S

20:53:20 VERY CLEAR THAT THE BENEFITS ARE REALLY ACCRUING TO THE TENANTS AS OPPOSED TO 
20:53:25 THE MIDDLE PEOPLE WHO ARE PROCESSING ALL THE BONDS  AND, YOU KNOW, THE 
20:53:26 TRANSACTION.

20:53:32 SO ANYWAY, THOSE ARE A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT ARE OUT THERE IN TERMS OF MIDDLE 
20:53:35 INCOME HOUSING THAT AS YOU MENTIONED, IT'S A TOUGH NUT TO CRACK.

20:53:41 >> Councilmember Salwan:   YES THAT'S A GOOD POINT YOU RAISE AND THE OTHER 
20:53:45 THING THAT ALWAYS COMES UP IS THE COST TO BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING.

20:53:47 WE TALKED ABOUT SOME OF THOSE.

20:53:55 THERE IS THE STATISTIC THAT IT COST $750,000 TO 800,000 PER UNIT.

20:53:58 WHAT IS THE DRIVER ALL THOSE COSTS.

20:54:04 INSTEAD OF BUILDING NEW, IS THERE A WAY TO BUY EXISTING APARTMENTS, TAKE THEM 
20:54:06 OVER AND RENT THEM OUT?

20:54:13 MAYBE AN APARTMENT MAY COST  $300,000 A UNIT, MAYBE NOT  FANCIEST APARTMENT 
20:54:14 BUT SOMETHING WE COULD LEVERAGE BETTER.

20:54:20 I JUST WARRANT TO GET YOUR FEED BACK, YOU KNOW, HOW WE COULD LOOK AT THOSE, 
20:54:26 IF IT HAPPENS WAYS TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN, MODULAR HOUSING, OTHER THINGS THAT 
20:54:29 PEOPLE ARE DOING, JUST WANT TO GET YOUR THOUGHTS

20:54:31 ON THAT.

20:54:33 

20:54:37 >> Dan Schoenholz:   THE DRIVERS ARE LAND COST LABOR COST ALL HAVE 
20:54:39 INCREASED DRAMATICALLY OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS.

20:54:44 ALSO THE CITY HAS FEES, THAT'S ONE OF THE STEPS THAT THE COUNCIL TOOK LAST 
20:54:48 YEAR WITH THE LOWER IMPACT FEES BY 50%.

20:54:49 IN CERTAIN CATEGORIES.

20:54:55 AND THAT WILL HAVE A DOM NOTICE EFFECT IN MAKING THE COST OF EACH UNIT LESS 
20:54:57 THAN IT WOULD BE OTHERWISE.

20:55:02 SO THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT THE CITY CAN CONTROL AND WE'VE TAKEN ACTION TO 
20:55:07 TRY TO MINIMIZE THIS BUT THERE IS A LOT THAT WE CAN'T CONTROL AND YOU KNOW, 
20:55:14 THOSE LAND, LABOR AND MATERIAL COSTS

20:55:15 ARE HIGH FOR EVERYBODY.

20:55:21 AND WHAT WAS THE SECOND PART OF YOUR QUESTION?

20:55:24 COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN?

20:55:30 >> Councilmember Salwan:   BUYING EXISTING BUILDINGS APARTMENT BUILDINGS 
20:55:32 INSTEAD OF BUYING NEW ONCE.

20:55:37 >> Dan Schoenholz:   THE PROBLEM IS THAT HOUSING COST AT ROOT IN THE BAY 
20:55:41 AREA IS A FUNCTION OF THE SUPPLY BEING FAR TOO LOW FOR THE DEMAND.

20:55:49 SO IF YOU DO PURCHASE EXISTING HOUSING STOCK AND CONVERT IT TO AFFORDABLE OR 
20:55:54 MIDDLE INCOME OR WHATEVER, THAT DOES HELP THE FOLK IN THAT PARTICULAR 
20:55:56 INCOME CATEGORY BUT IT DOESN'T HELP THE OVERALL

20:55:58 SHORTAGE.

20:56:03 AND SO YOU KNOW, I THINK THE FOCUS OF STATE POLICY HAS REALLY BEEN TO 
20:56:08 INCREASE SUPPLY, ALTHOUGH AGAIN, THERE ARE SOME, YOU KNOW, PROGRAMS THAT 
20:56:13 MIGHT ALLOW FOR PURCHASING EXISTING HOUSING AND CONVERTING

20:56:14  IT TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING.

20:56:16 >> Councilmember Salwan:   THANK YOU.

20:56:17 I APPRECIATE THAT.

20:56:20 >> Dan Schoenholz:   YOU'RE WELCOME.

20:56:21 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

20:56:26 I WAS GOING TO REALLY QUICKLY ADDRESS SOME OF YOUR COMMENTS, VICE MAYOR 
20:56:26 SALWAN.

20:56:30 AND I WANTED TO MENTION THAT STAFF HAS BEEN CREATIVE IN THE PAST WHEN WE HAD 
20:56:35 OUR LOW INCOME PROJECT WHICH WAS THE HABITAT FOR HUMANITY, WHEN THE 
20:56:37 FINANCING CHANGED I KNOW THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO WORK

20:56:45 WITH THE STATE AND GET IF USAGE OF CAP AND TRADE FUNDS TO BE ABLE TO USE 
20:56:48 THAT, THAT WAS A POD RAT RATE PROJECT.

20:56:53 BUT AS YOU MENTIONED IT'S HARD TO MAKE INROADS IN MODERATE OR WORKFORCE 
20:56:54 HOUSING.

20:57:00 SOME EMPLOYERS AND PEOPLE HAVE DONE PARTNERSHIPS ALSO THAT'S WHERE WE ARE 
20:57:03 HOPEFULLY ABLE TO SEEK SOME OF THOSE AND ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE AREAS BUT IT 
20:57:04 IS A KEY AREA.

20:57:07 THANK YOU FOR THE COMMENTS.

20:57:11 I THINK -- COUNCILMEMBER COX.

20:57:11 THANK YOU.

20:57:13 >> Councilmember Cox:   THANK YOU VERY MUCH MAYOR.

20:57:23 I WOULD LIKE TO FIRST THANK DAVID AND ALL OF HIS COMMITTEE AND TEAM FOR THE 
20:57:28 WONDERFUL WORK YOU'RE DOING AND MAYBING PROGRESS AND IT LOOKS LIKE EACH 
20:57:30 CATEGORY WE DO HAVE NUMBERS OVER THE NEXT EIGHT

20:57:32 YEARS.

20:57:39 ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I WAS CURIOUS ABOUT IS, I SEE THE LIST OF SOME OF 
20:57:45 THE BREAKDOWN IN TERMS OF PENDING, APPROVED AND PERMITTED DEVELOPMENT.

20:57:53 AND IT WOULD BE MOST HELPFUL IF THERE'S A WAY YOU COULD PUT IT IN THE 
20:57:55 DIFFERENT DISTRICTS SO WE COULD KIND OF SEE.

20:57:59 I KNOW SOME OF THE DISTRICTS ARE VERY FAMILIAR WITH ALL OF US IN DIFFERENT 
20:58:04 WAYS BUT MAYBE TO HELP UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENT BREAKDOWNS IN THE DISTRICT 
20:58:08 TO SEE IF THERE'S SOME HELP THAT WE -- THAT COULD

20:58:13 BE HELPED IN OTHER AREAS AND JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE BREAKDOWN 
20:58:14 THERE.

20:58:22 THAT'S LIKE TABLE 8-4 THAT YOU HAVE LISTED FOR THAT PART.

20:58:29 AND ALSO, LIKE, FOR EXAMPLE, OVER THE LAST YEAR WE LIKE APPROVED A PROJECT 
20:58:35 THAT WAS ON OSGOOD THAT WAS CLOSE TO -- THAT WOULD BE CLOSE -- IT WAS A 
20:58:38 HOUSING PROJECT THAT WE APPROVED BUT IT WAS CLOSE TO

20:58:42 THE FUTURE IRVINGTON BART STATION.

20:58:47 THOSE ARE KIND OF THE REDEVELOPMENT NUMBERS THAT ARE ROLLED UP I ASSUME 
20:58:51 INTO WHAT YOU HAVE AS THE RHNA NUMBERS  CORRECT?

20:58:57 AND IN THAT REGARDS, IS THAT CORRECT?

20:59:02 >> Dan Schoenholz:   YES, IN THAT TABLE THE PROJECTS THAT HAVEN'T GOTTEN 
20:59:06 PERMITS AND  STARTED CONSTRUCTION ARE CONSIDERED PIPELINE PROJECTS.

20:59:10 SO DEPENDING ON WHICH PROJECT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IT MIGHT BE IN THE 
20:59:15 PIPELINE OR IT MIGHT BE UNDER CONSTRUCTION.

20:59:22 ON OSGOOD THE AFFORDABLE, I DON'T THINK ANY OF THE AFFORDABLE UNITS THERE ARE 
20:59:25 UNDER CONSTRUCTION YET SO THEY ARE PROBABLY ALL IN THE PIPELINE.

20:59:34 BUT WE COULD --

20:59:36 >> Mayor Mei:   MY APOLOGIES.

20:59:40 >> Councilmember Cox:   I CAN'T HEAR THE REST OF WHAT DAN IS SAYING.

20:59:43 >> Mayor Mei:   I THINK HE'S TEMPORARILY PAUSED THERE.

20:59:47 I THINK YOU'RE MOVING AGAIN, MUST BE BANDWIDTH.

21:00:05 DAN, MY APOLOGY, DIRECTOR SCHOENHOLZ, I CAN'T HEAR YOU.

21:00:10 .

21:00:12 >> Dan Schoenholz:   CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW?

21:00:17 I'M NOT SURE WHEN I GOT CUT OFF BUT BASICALLY WE CAN BREAK OUT THE NUMBERS 
21:00:20 FOR YOU IN EACH OF THE CATEGORIES AND BY DISTRICT.

21:00:26 >> Councilmember Cox:   THAT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL, JUST TO SEE HOW WE'RE 
21:00:31 DOING IN OTHER AREAS OF HELP, YOU KNOW THERE IS SOMETHING ELSE THAT CAN BE 
21:00:32 DONE HAD.

21:00:39 I THINK THAT YOU'VE DONE A GOOD JOB IN REACHING OUT TO THE PUBLIC COMMENT FOR 
21:00:40 ENGAGEMENT AND INPUT.

21:00:47 I DO THINK THAT IT WOULD BE WISE, IF WE -- IF THERE WAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO MEET 
21:00:54 WITH THE ALAMEDA BUILDING TRADES, ALAMEDA COUNTY BUILDING TRADES COUNCIL 
21:00:58 TO GET THEIR INPUT ON, OF COURSE WE DID HEAR

21:01:01 TONIGHT FROM THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA CARPENTERS.

21:01:07 BUT I THINK IT WOULD BEHOOVE US TO GET THEIR INPUT AS WELL.

21:01:12 BECAUSE THEY'RE SOME OF THE ONES THAT WILL SEE FIRSTHAND AS WELL AND PROVIDE 
21:01:17 INFORMATION THAT COULD BE HELPFUL FOR US TO BE MADE AWARE OF AS WELL.

21:01:30 AND BESIDES THE LABOR AND THE LABOR AND THE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM.

21:01:31 THAT WOULD BE GRADE.

21:01:35 ANOTHER THING I WAS THINKING ABOUT WAS, DID YOU A LOT OF GOOD WORK IN MEETING 
21:01:39 WITH ALL THE DIFFERENT COMMISSIONS .

21:01:49 I WASN'T SURE IF I SAW, WE DO HAVE A CALIFORNIA SCHOOL FOR THE DEAF AND 
21:01:49 BLIND.

21:01:55 AND IT WOULD BE ALSO GOOD TO GET SOME INPUT IN THAT COMMUNITY AS WELL, SINCE 
21:02:00 THEY'RE HOUSED RIGHT HERE IN FREMONT AND DIRECTLY TIED IN WITH OHLONE 
21:02:01 COLLEGE.

21:02:07 AND THAT I KNOW THAT WOULD REQUIRE SOME INTERPRETERS TO HELP ASSIST.

21:02:12 AND BASICALLY HAVING -- BEING ABLE TO HAVE ACCESS SO THAT THEY COULD ALSO 
21:02:17 GET THEIR INPUT TO HELP MAKE IT WELL ROUNDED FOR THAT MATTER.

21:02:23 AND I'M NOT SURE IF I SAW, FORGIVE ME, I KNOW IT IS QUITE A FEW HUNDRED PAGES 
21:02:29 BUT ALSO, MAKING A NOTE, DID WE CHECK WITH EVERY SINGLE COMMISSION THAT'S 
21:02:31 PART OF THE CITY OF FREMONT?

21:02:35 INCLUDING THE MOBILITY AND SENIORS?

21:02:39 JUST TO MAKE SURE WE RUN IT BY THEM.

21:02:45 AND RECREATION, WHICH COULD KIND OF HAVE A DIVERSE MIX OF DIFFERENT 
21:02:45 VIEWPOINTS THERE.

21:02:51 SO THOSE ARE JUST A COUPLE OF OTHER ONES JUST TO -- IF I MISSED IT, I 
21:02:52 MIGHT HAVE.

21:02:54 BUT JUST IN CASE.

21:03:02 JUST TO KIND OF INCLUDE THAT AS PART OF YOUR WELL ROUNDEDNESS AND MAYBE 
21:03:07 REACHING OUT TO SOME OTHER DIVERSE GROUPS THAT DO A LOT OF WORK WITH THE 
21:03:16 CITY OF FREMONT, SUCH AS THE GLOBE

21:03:27 CHECKING IN WITH THEM, THE  GURDWARA, SOME OF THEM ARE ACTIVE ON THE GROUPS, 
21:03:33 TO BE ABLE TO GET THEIR INPUT EVEN LIKE COMPASSION NETWORK WHICH IS MADE UP OF 
21:03:34 A LOT OF OUR CHURCHES THAT YOU

21:03:37 COULD REACH OUT TO THOSE GROUPS AS WELL.

21:03:42 BECAUSE THEY COULD GET A  CROSS-SECTION OF OTHERS THAT COULD BE MOST HELPFUL 
21:03:44 WITH THIS TYPE OF INFORMATION.

21:03:50 SO I THINK YOU GUYS HAVE MADE A LOT OF PROGRESS, AND IN THE SHORT TIME THAT 
21:03:55 WE'VE SEEN SOME OF THESE UPDATES, IT'S JUST KIND OF HARD TO SEE THAT WE HAVE 
21:03:57 ALL THESE NUMBERS AND WITH A LOT OF THINGS THAT

21:04:07 ARE OUT OF OUR CONTROL, OF HOW THERE'S NO REPRIEVE, NO RELIEF, IN CARRYING 
21:04:13 OUT SOME OF THESE THINGS, BECAUSE WE'RE SEEING IT ALL FIRSTHAND OF ESPECIALLY 
21:04:15 IN THE MATERIAL AREA THAT THERE IS A LOT OF

21:04:22 SHORTAGES AND LABOR SHORTAGES IN THESE AREAS THAT WILL IMPACT THE HOUSING TO 
21:04:24 MAKE THESE NUMBERS HAPPEN.

21:04:31 HAS THERE BEEN ANY TALKS OF ANY REPRIEVE AT THIS POINT, OR IS THERE 
21:04:35 ANY, MORE COLLECTIVE NUMBERS OR MORE DEFINITIVE AFTER THE FIRST QUARTER IN 
21:04:37 THIS NEW YEAR?

21:04:42 I DON'T KNOW HOW OFTEN YOU'RE HAVING THE -- YOU KNOW, THEY HAVE THE 
21:04:45 MEETINGS WITH THE STATE FOR HOUSING.

21:04:49 BUT JUST SEEING IF THERE'S SOME UPCOMING THINGS THAT COULD BE MOST 
21:04:53 HELPFUL FOR THEM TO HELP GIVE US SOME REFREE OF AND WE'RE NOT JUST US, BUT 
21:04:55 IT'S ACROSS THE STATE.

21:04:59 A LOT OF US CITIES ARE GOING TO BE SEEING SOME CHANGES  OCCURRING.

21:05:01 SO JUST SEEING IF THERE'S ANYTHING.

21:05:06 I KNOW -- I GUESS WE DO -- I KNOW WE DO HAVE OUR GOVERNMENT RELATIONS AND 
21:05:09 MAYBE THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING TO PARTNER WITH THERE.

21:05:14 AND SEEING THERE COULD BE SOME HELP THERE IN THAT REGARDS AND WORKING WITH 
21:05:18 OUR ASSEMBLY MEMBER --

21:05:21 >> Dan Schoenholz:   JUST ON THE TOPIC OF THE NUMBERS THAT WE'VE BEEN 
21:05:23 ASSIGNED, NUMBERS WERE FINAL NOW.

21:05:28 THERE WAS A PERIOD WHERE CITIES COULD APPEAL.

21:05:34 FREMONT DID NOT APPEAL BECAUSE IN LARGE PART, THE ASSIGNMENT WE GOT WAS QUITE 
21:05:39 A BIT LOWER THAN WHAT WAS IN SOME OF THE EARLIER DRAFTS SO WE WERE ACTUALLY 
21:05:40 QUITE HAPPY WITH THE NUMBER THAT WE GOT.

21:05:43 >> Councilmember Cox:   OH,  OKAY.

21:05:48 >> Dan Schoenholz:   EVEN SO, THE CITIES THAT DID REPEAL, ALL OF THE 
21:05:51 APPEALS WERE REJECTED.

21:05:59 MAYBE ONE OR TWO WERE GIVEN IN THAT REGARD BUT THEY SAID SORRY, THESE ARE 
21:06:00 YOUR NUMBERS.

21:06:03 THE NUMBERS WE HAVE ARE THE NUMBERS THAT WE HAVE TO PLAN FOR AND THAT'S 
21:06:05 WHAT THE DOCUMENT THAT IS BEFORE YOU DOES.

21:06:08 >> Councilmember Cox:   OKAY, GOT IT, OKAY.

21:06:17 I APPRECIATE THAT REFREESH ON THAT PART, JUST DOUBLE CHECKING.

21:06:20 >> Dan Schoenholz:   FAIR QUESTION.

21:06:24 >> Councilmember Cox:   I APPRECIATE EVERYBODY'S EFFORT AND HOPEFULLY WE 
21:06:29 COULD HAVE MORE INPUT FROM OUR STAKEHOLDERS AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS AS 
21:06:29 WELL.

21:06:32 THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORTH TONIGHT, THANK YOU FOR THE HARD WORK.

21:06:37 >> Mayor Mei:   SO I WANTED TO ADD SOME COMMENTS.

21:06:40 I WANTED TO THANK THE TEAM FOR THEIR CONTINUED EFFORT.

21:06:46 THIS HAS BEEN AN ONGOING PROCESS WE HAVE BEEN WORKING THROUGH SINCE WE 
21:06:50 UPDATED THE HOUSING ELEMENT FROM 2020 TO 2023.

21:06:56 IT'S BEEN A CONVERSATION WITH ABAG AND MTC FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS.

21:07:00 OUR NUMBERS WERE AS HIGH AS  17,000 UNITS AND I KNOW FOR MYSELF AND 
21:07:04 REPRESENTING OUR CITY I WAS GOING UP TO THE MEETINGS EVERY WEEK UP IN SAN 
21:07:06 FRANCISCO TO ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE METHODOLOGIES AND

21:07:10 THOUGHT PROCESSES AND I APPRECIATE THE STAFF'S EXTRA WORKS IN TERMS OF 
21:07:14 HELPING US TO JUSTIFY BECAUSE THEY WERE LOOKING AT A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT 
21:07:17 ELEMENTS IN TERMS OF HOW THEY SET THEIR NUMBERS.

21:07:21 IN TERMS OF THE AREAS WE MADE PROGRESS IN, I KNOW SOME PEOPLE HAVE MADE 
21:07:23 COMMENTS ABOUT PROJECTS THAT ARE OUT THERE.

21:07:28 WHEN WE APPROVE THINGS AND WE'VE BEEN THROUGH THESE CYCLES A CUSTOM OF TIMES 
21:07:33 FROM THE GENERAL PLAN THAT WE HAD SETTING PLACE IN 2011 TO NOW THE 
21:07:35 HOUSING ELEMENTS THAT OCCUR, IT HAS BEEN A STRUGGLE AND

21:07:40 CHALLENGE FOR US BECAUSE WHILE THE CITY IS APPROVING THE PERMITTING AND 
21:07:44 APPROVAL OF THE ENTITLEMENT FOR THESE PROPERTIES WE ARE NOT THE ONES WHO ARE 
21:07:48 ACTUALLY IN THE CONSTRUCTION OPTION IN TERMS OF

21:07:51 THE ONES BUILDING IT AND I APPRECIATE THE EXTRA EFFORTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE 
21:07:55 THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS SO THAT WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO MAKE SOME GREAT  
21:07:56 INROADS.

21:08:02 PART OF IT IS WITH ADVOCATES WITH OUR LEGISLATIVE POLICIES IN ASKING FOR 
21:08:08 THAT SUPPORT, AND THAT'S WHY WE HAVE SEEN SOME OF THE GREATEST NUMBERS EVER 
21:08:10 IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND PART OF IT IS ALSO TAKING

21:08:17 ADVANTAGE EVER PROGRAMS LIKE TRANSIT ORIENTED PROGRAMS AND I WANT PEOPLE TO 
21:08:18 UNDERSTAND THAT.

21:08:22 WHEN SOME OF THE SITUATIONS HAVE BEEN, DEVELOPERS HAVE EITHER NOT BEEN ABLE 
21:08:27 TO FINANCE IT OR HAD OTHER TYPES OF FINANCIAL OR BUSINESS TROUBLES, THAT 
21:08:29 WE CANNOT AS A CITY GO BUILD THEM.

21:08:33 WE CAN WORK THROUGH THE PROCESS AND I KNOW THAT'S BEEN OF EXTREME 
21:08:36 FRUSTRATION FOR US TO BE IN THAT SITUATION THAT WE'VE HAD A COUPLE OF 
21:08:37 THOSE SITUATIONS.

21:08:42 AND THAT'S SOMETHING LEGISLATIVE WISE THAT AT THE STATE LEVEL THEY WERE TO 
21:08:46 HAVE SOME REQUIREMENTS, I KNOW I HAD THIS CONVERSATION JUST THIS WEEK WITH 
21:08:49 THE PLANNING DEPARTMENT, IS THAT WITH SOME OF

21:08:53 THESE PROJECTS PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE ONCE WE APPROVE IT, IF SOMEONE WERE TO 
21:08:58 GO TO BANKRUPTCY OR TO HAVE OTHER -- HAVE THE PROPERTIES TIED UP WE CANNOT 
21:09:01 AS A CITY GO OVER AND CONSTRUCT IT OURSELVES.

21:09:07 IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE WORK THROUGH THE BANKRUPTCY OR RECOVERY IN TERMS OF HOW 
21:09:13 WE CAN EXPEDITE THOSE TYPES OF ISSUES.

21:09:16 OTHER THINGS THAT ARE IMPORTANT IS THAT WHEN IT COMES TO  ENGAGING OUR PUBLIC 
21:09:20 WE WANT TO ENGAGE PEOPLE, EVERYONE NOT JUST OUR COMMISSIONS BUT THROUGH THE 
21:09:21 SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN PARTNERSHIP.

21:09:26 AND SO THAT'S WHY WE'RE REALLY TRYING TO GET THIS OUT AND I'M SURE WE'RE 
21:09:31 ALSO TRYING TO HOPEFULLY DO THIS IN OTHER LANGUAGES THAT INCLUDES SIGN 
21:09:34 LANGUAGE AND OTHER AREAS WHERE THE PUBLIC IS ABLE TO

21:09:36 COMMUNICATE THEIR THOUGHTS TO US ON THIS AREA.

21:09:40 REGARDING SOME OF THE QUESTIONS ABOUT COST, CERTAINLY THESE LAST COUPLE OF 
21:09:45 YEARS HAVE BEEN VERY CHALLENGING BECAUSE OF TERMS COSTS AND FIRES AND 
21:09:49 OTHER NATURAL DISASTERS AND SUPPLY CHAIN, I KNOW THERE

21:09:53 HAVE BEEN SOME INTERESTING OPTIONS THIS TERMS OF CONSTRUCTION AND HOW THEY ARE 
21:09:58 ABLE TO FRAME AND  USE -- UTILIZE DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGIES TO ADDRESS SOME 
21:09:59 OF THOSE.

21:10:03 I ALSO ENCOURAGE I KNOW WE HAD THE UNION SPEAK EARLIER ON THIS AND 
21:10:08 CERTAINLY WE'RE ALWAYS INTERESTED IN PARTNERING AND I APPRECIATE THE 
21:10:13 PARTNERSHIPS WE HAVE MADE SUCH AS THE SKINNELL PROPERTY.

21:10:18 I KNOW THAT THE MISSION VALLEY ROP CONTINUES TO TRY TO BUILD THAT 
21:10:25 PIPELINE FOR  APPRENTICESHIPS AND WE CERTAINLY ENCOURAGE, I KNOW THERE ARE 
21:10:27 LOCATIONS IN OAKLAND AND SAN JOSE AND WE WOULD

21:10:31 LOVE TO HAVE SOME THOSE SIMILAR TYPE OF EFFORTS FOCUSED OR BUILT ON.

21:10:35 WE HAVE HAD VACANT PROPERTIES WE'VE SEEN WOULD BE WONDERFUL ESPECIALLY 
21:10:38 SINCE WE HAVE UNIQUE TYPES OF APPRENTICESHIP THAT COULD BE REALLY 
21:10:41 INTERESTING WHETHER IT'S SOLAR BECAUSE WE ARE THE NUMBER ONE

21:10:45 CITY IN THE UNITED STATES FOR CLEAN TECHNOLOGY MANUFACTURING.

21:10:50 AND ALSO, FOR AND SOME OF THE OTHER AREAS IN TERMS OF INNOVATION.

21:10:55 I KNOW THAT I SIT ALONG WITH COUNCILMEMBER COX ON EAST BAY 
21:10:59 COMMUNITY ENERGY AND THEY HAVE BEEN IN THE PROCESS THEY HAVE A HAZARDOUS IN 
21:10:59 OAKLAND.

21:11:02 BUT WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT OPPORTUNITIES ON HOW WE GROW THE 
21:11:05 PIPELINE OF THE WORK FORCE AS WE MOVE FORWARD THAT IS ONE OF THE THINGS 
21:11:08 WE'RE LOOKING AT IS ALSO POSSIBLY BUILDING TRAINING CENTERS.

21:11:11 WE ARE LOOKING AT LOCATIONS THAT CAN HELP FACILITATE THAT.

21:11:15 AND SO WITH SOME OF THE ADVANCE MANUFACTURING WE HAVE I'M HOPING THAT 
21:11:20 WE ALSO ENCOURAGE THAT TYPE OF OPPORTUNITY AND BUILD THAT PIPELINE IN 
21:11:21 PARTNERSHIP.

21:11:25 SO I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS THAT ARE MADE AND THAT WE ARE ALSO WAITING, I 
21:11:28 KNOW SOMEBODY ASKED THE QUESTION EARLIER ABOUT TRANSITIONING HOTELS 
21:11:32 INTO OR EXISTING STRUCTURE INTO AFFORDABLE LOW INCOME

21:11:35 HOUSING AND THAT'S KIND OF WHAT WE'RE WAITING FOR RIGHT NOW.

21:11:41 I DON'T KNOW IF WE HAVE ANY NEWS RIGHT NOW, PROBABLY NOT ON PROJECT ROOMKEY.

21:11:50 WE HAVE A STRUCTURE THAT EXISTS AND BECAUSE OF THE  REHABILITATING IT WILL 
21:11:51 HELP TO BUILD THIS HOUSING.

21:12:03 WHEN WE TALK ABOUT ADUS, WE JUST DID A SECTION WITH OUR TAX ASSESSOR, FON LA 
21:12:07 AND THERE ARE CELLULAR TYPES OF DISCUSSIONS THAT ARE OCCURRING, 
21:12:11 WHETHER IT IS WITH THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT COMMISSIONS, WITH

21:12:16 ALSO CIVIC WELL, I KNOW THEY ARE DOING A DISCUSSION ABOUT ADVANCING ADUS, AND 
21:12:21 WITH THE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES WE HAD SOME LEGISLATIVE POLICY UPDATES AS 
21:12:23 WE FROACHED SUMMER RECESS THAT TALKED

21:12:26 ABOUT SOME OF THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE HAVE TO FOCUS ON MAKING SOME INROADS.

21:12:31 BUT TRULY FOR US TO MAKE SOME  INROADS ON AREAS LIKE MODERATE AND SOME OTHER 
21:12:36 AREAS WE NEED TO HAVE PEOPLE STEP UP IN TERMS OF LEGISLATIVE POLICIES AND 
21:12:38 ADVOCACY ON FINANCING OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE CAN

21:12:42 BUILD PEARMS WITH LABOR AND WITH OTHER GROUPS IN TERMS OF WORKFORCE 
21:12:47 DEVELOPMENT AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT HOPEFULLY AS WE'RE TRANSITIONING WITH 
21:12:49 EDUCATION OPPORTUNITIES THAT THESE ARE AREAS THAT WE CAN

21:12:49 ENCOURAGE.

21:12:55 AND A GOOD EXAMPLE WAS YESTERDAY, WHERE WE HAD, WHILE IT'S NOT THIS RELATED IN 
21:13:00 THIS INCOME OR INDUSTRY OF TESLA WE WORK WITH SO MANY OF OUR COMMUNITY 
21:13:03 COLLEGES AND SMART MANUFACTURING AND THESE ARE

21:13:06 OPPORTUNITIES WE CAN PARTNER IN TERMS OF BUILDING THE PIPELINE OF THE 
21:13:12 WORKERS THAT WE ARE  LOOKING FOR AND HAVE THOSE CONNECTIONS WITH 
21:13:14 APPRENTICESHIP AROUND JOURNEYMAN PROJECTS.

21:13:19 I WANTED TO THANK YOU FOR THE TIMELINESS AND THE ENGAGEMENT AND FOR 
21:13:21 PEOPLE TO PLEASE PROVIDE A RESPONSE.

21:13:26 I THINK IT IS OFTENTIMES WHEN WE HEAR FROM MANY PEOPLE AFTER THE NUMBERS 
21:13:29 HAVE BEEN BUILT AND CERTAINLY THERE IS AN IMPACT WHENEVER HOUSING IS PUT IN 
21:13:31 PLACE BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS

21:13:35 THE  COMMUNITY'S NEEDS AND IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT BUILDING A HOME, IT'S ABOUT 
21:13:38 BUILDING A COMMUNITY AND ALL THE DIFFERENT PIECES DO MATTER.

21:13:42 AND SO INCLUDING EDUCATION, INCLUDING TRANSPORTATION, AND THE INFRASTRUCTURE 
21:13:46 AND HOPEFULLY WE'RE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THESE RARE OPPORTUNITIES WITH LOCAL 
21:13:48 INFRASTRUCTURE PLANS TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE

21:13:50 MOST NEEDY THAT WE HAVE IN OUR COMMUNITY.

21:13:54 SO THANKS AGAIN FOR THIS PRESENTATION.

21:13:54 >> Dan Schoenholz:   THANK YOU.

21:14:02 >> Mayor Mei:   OKAY, THANK YOU AND NEXT ON THE AGENDA ITEM THIS EVENING 
21:14:05 IS ITEM 5B.

21:14:09 WHICH IS THE ADJUSTMENT TO THE SALARIES OF THE MAYOR AND THE COUNCILMEMBERS.

21:14:11 AND THERE'S NO PRESENTATION.

21:14:21 BUT OUR FINANCE DIRECTOR DAVE PERSSELIN AND ASSISTANT DIRECTOR DAVE STOP ARE 
21:14:23 AVAILABLE FOR COMMENTS.

21:14:25 I DON'T KNOW IF THERE ARE QUESTIONS FROM THE COUNCILMEMBERS FIRST.

21:14:29 OKAY.

21:14:37 AND ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE PUBLIC?

21:14:38 KELLY WELCOME.

21:14:44 OUR FIRST SPEAKER, PUBLIC COMMENT IS KELLY ABREU.

21:14:53 >> JUST LIKE TO REFER BACK TO WHAT COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN WAS SAYING, ABOUT 
21:14:57 THE HUGE IMPACT OF THESE SARM AND COMPENSATION INCREASES ON THE CITY 
21:14:58 BUDGET.

21:15:03 ON THIS CASE, ALL THESE NUMBERS IF YOU ADD THEM ALL UP ARE PROBABLY GOING TO 
21:15:05 HAVE LIKE NO IMPACT ON THE CITY BUDGET.

21:15:10 SO, YOU KNOW, I THINK YOU'RE  GETTING -- WHAT THIS COUNCIL OUGHT TO BE 
21:15:20 WORKING ON IS TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET THE BUDGET BALANCED WHEN YOU TAKE 
21:15:24 HUGE, HUGE DEPARTMENTS AND PUT IN HUGE COMPENSATION

21:15:29 INCREASES, AND THEN HOPE THAT SOMEHOW IT'S GOING TO BALANCE OUT IN THE END 
21:15:33 SOMEWHERE DOWN LINE IN OCTOBER, RIGHT BEFORE THE ELECTION.

21:15:42 BUT THIS, LET'S -- WHAT IS IT, KEEP THE EYES ON THE PRIZE OR KEEP THE EYE ON 
21:15:44 THE BALL AND THAT'S THE BIG NUMBERS IN THE BUDGET.

21:15:45 THANK YOU.

21:15:48 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

21:15:58 COULD I ASK THAT WE HAVE A PRESENTATION OR JUST AT LEAST A COMMENT ON WHAT IS 
21:16:07 BEING PROPOSED THIS EVENING FROM THE STAFF AND THE RECOMMENDATION?

21:16:11 >> I WOULD ASK THAT OUR FINANCE DIRECTOR, THERE YOU ARE DAVE, DAVE 
21:16:15 COULD YOU JUST PLEASE PROVIDE A HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW OF WHAT WE'RE DOING AND 
21:16:31 WHY AS IT RELATES TO THE MUNI CODE.

21:16:31 >> David Persselin:   SURE.

21:16:35 A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO AGO WE IDENTIFIED ESSENTIALLY A PROBLEM IN THAT THERE 
21:16:40 WAS NO MECHANISM FOR RE-LOOKING AT MAYOR AND COUNCIL SALARIES ON A 
21:16:42 REGULAR BASIS.

21:16:51 COUNCIL ASKED US TO BRING FORWARD A RECOMMENDED PROCESS WHICH IS NOW PART 
21:16:54 OF THE CITY MUNICIPAL CODE.

21:17:00 SO AS PART OF THE MUNI CODE EVERY TWO YEARS WE TAKE A LOOK AT THE CITY 
21:17:08 COUNCIL SALARIES IN THE CONTEXT OF THE CHANGE IN CPI THAT'S TAKEN PLACE OVER 
21:17:11 THE LAST TWO YEARS.

21:17:17 AND WE ALSO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION, BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, COULD BE A LARGE 
21:17:21 NUMBER, THAT THERE SHOULD BE A CAP OF SOME SORT, AND THAT CAP WAS 
21:17:22 ESTABLISHED AT 4%.

21:17:32 SO THE BASIC IDEA IS THAT THE CITY COUNCIL CONSIDERS EVERY TWO YEARS 
21:17:43 WHETHER TO GIVE THE COUNCIL AN INCREASE OF THE  LESSER OF 4% OR THE CPI 
21:17:48 INCREASE OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS, OR WHETHER TO DO

21:17:48 SOMETHING DIFFERENT.

21:17:53 THEY CAN DO NOTHING, OR THEY COULD DO SOMETHING BETWEEN ZERO AND 4%.

21:18:03 TWO YEARS AGO, BECAUSE WE WERE IN THE PROCESS OF ELIMINATING MILLIONS OF 
21:18:05 DOLLARS FROM THE BUDGET, THERE WAS NO ADJUSTMENT.

21:18:13 SO THE CURRENT LEVEL OF MAYOR AND COUNCIL SALARY IS WHAT WAS IN PLACE 
21:18:21  FOR THE COUNCIL THAT WAS SEATED FOUR YEARS AGO IN I THINK IT WAS DECEMBER 
21:18:22 OF 2018.

21:18:27 ONE OF THE KEY POINTS TO NOTE IS THAT ALTHOUGH THE COUNCIL'S BEING ASKED TO 
21:18:31 TAKE AN ACTION TONIGHT, THIS ACTION DOES NOT BECOME EFFECTIVE UNTIL THE 
21:18:33 NEW COUNCIL IS SEATED.

21:18:37 WHICH WILL PRESUMABLY BE IN DECEMBER OF 2022.

21:18:48 SO TONIGHT WE'VE PRESENTED YOU WITH INFORMATION RELATED TO THE COST OF 
21:18:55  LIVING CHANGE THAT'S TAKEN PLACE AND WE'VE ALSO NOTED THAT THIS IS GREATER 
21:18:58 THAN THE 4% CAP.

21:19:05 SO THE COUNCIL'S DECISION TONIGHT IS DO YOU WANT TO MOVE FORWARD WITH 4% 
21:19:11 ADJUSTMENT, AND THE 4% IS APPLIED OVER THE TWO YEARS.

21:19:16 STATEWIDE ACTUALLY PROVIDES SOME GUIDANCE ON HOW TO CREATE THAT 
21:19:22 ADJUSTMENT SO THIS IS NOT A COMPOUNDED INCREASE, THAT IS NOT ALLOWED BY STATE 
21:19:22 LAW.

21:19:34 SO IT'S LITERALLY A 4% INCREASE AND A 4% INCREASE.

21:19:38 SO THAT'S THE GIST OF IT SO I'LL TURN IT BACK OVER TO COUNCIL.

21:19:39 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

21:19:49 ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE  COUNCILMEMBERS?

21:19:56 SO TO CLARIFY, THIS IS A PROPOSED ADJUSTMENT, WOULD BE THE 4%.

21:20:03 AND I ALSO WANTED TO CLARIFY FOR -- COULD YOU SHARE DIRECTOR PERSSELIN 
21:20:07 WHAT THE SALARY IS SO THERE MAY BE SOME CONFUSION WHAT THE SALARY IS FOR THE 
21:20:12 MAYOR AND THE COUNCILMEMBERS AS IT STANDS.

21:20:16 >> David Persselin:   OKAY, SO BEAR WITH ME FOR A MOMENT PLEASE WHILE I 
21:20:17 BRING THAT UP.

21:20:17 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

21:20:33 >> AND WHILE DIRECTOR PERSSELIN LOOKS THAT UP I JUST WANT TO REMIND THE 
21:20:37 COUNCIL THIS IS AN ORDINANCE SO TONIGHT THE ACTION IS TO INTRODUCE AN 
21:20:41 ORDINANCE THAT WOULD EFFECTUATE THOSE INCREASES.

21:20:46 WE WOULD STILL COME BACK AT A FUTURE COUNCIL MEETING AND THOSE INCREASES 
21:20:49 WOULD NOT BE 77 UNTIL THE NEXT ELECTION CYCLE.

21:20:56  EFFECTIVE UNTIL THE NEXT ELECTION CYCLE.

21:21:04 >> David Persselin:   OKAY SO THE CURRENT SALARIES ARE  $2247.93 PER 
21:21:12 MONTH FOR COUNCILMEMBERS AND $3,393.78 PER MONTH FOR THE MAYOR.

21:21:18 AND WITH THE RECOMMENDED 4% INCREASE, THAT WOULD INCREASE THE CITY COUNCIL 
21:21:27 MEMBERS TO  $2427.76 PER MONTH, AND THE MAYOR TO $4313.28 PER MONTH.

21:21:34 AND AGAIN THAT WOULD NOT TAKE EFFECT UNTIL THE NEW CITY COUNCIL IS SEATED 
21:21:36 FOLLOWING THE ELECTION ON NOVEMBER 8th.

21:21:38 >> Mayor Mei:   CORRECT.

21:21:56 SO I SEE NO HANDS RAISED.

21:21:57 >> The Clerk:   DID YOU OPEN THE PUBLIC HEARING?

21:22:01 >> Mayor Mei:   I THOUGHT I DID, BUT LET ME DO THAT AGAIN.

21:22:04 I THOUGHT WE HAD KELLY SPEAK ON THAT.

21:22:05 WAS THAT NOT CORRECT?

21:22:08 >> YES, WE DID RECEIVE ONE PUBLIC COMMENT.

21:22:11 >> Mayor Mei:   UNLESS THERE IS SOMEONE ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK I'D LIKE 
21:22:15 TO CLOSE THE PUBLIC HEARING AGAIN.

21:22:16 >> The Clerk:   ALL RIGHT.

21:22:17 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

21:22:21 DESTINY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COUNCIL?

21:22:26 COULD I ASK DIRECTOR PERSSELIN IF YOU COULD MAKE A COMMENT, HOW IS THE 
21:22:29 NUMBER ORIGINALLY CALCULATED SO THE PUBLIC UNDERSTANDS HOW IT WAS 
21:22:30  FORMULATED?

21:22:35 I BELIEVE IT'S BASED OFF THE PERCENTAGE RELATED TO THE POPULATION SIZE.

21:22:41 BECAUSE WE ARE THE LARGEST  NON-CHARTER CITY IN CALIFORNIA.

21:22:45 I BELIEVE WE'RE THE LARGEST CITY MANAGER LED FORM OF GOVERNMENT IN 
21:22:47 TERMS OF A MUNICIPALITY.

21:22:52 SOME OF OUR NEIGHBORING CITIES ARE IN A DIFFERENT SITUATION WHICH IS WHY THE 
21:22:53 SALARIES ARE DIFFERENT.

21:22:57 AND JUST TO CLARIFY FOR THE PUBLIC TOO BECAUSE THERE IS SOMETIMES SOME 
21:23:00 MISCONCEPTIONS IN TERMS OF HOW VAST THE DIFFERENCE IS.

21:23:06 >> David Persselin:   SO ACTUALLY I'M NOT SURE I CAN ANSWER YOUR QUESTION 
21:23:11 WELL.

21:23:15 THE -- I HAVE INFORMATION FOR THE CITY OF FREMONT GOING BACK TO I THINK IT'S 
21:23:23 AROUND THE YEAR 2000 OR SO FOR WHAT THE COUNCILMEMBER AND MAYOR SALARIES WERE 
21:23:23 AT THAT TIME.

21:23:33 I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE ORIGINAL BASIS WAS FOR WHATEVER THOSE ORIGINAL 
21:23:34 AMOUNTS WERE.

21:23:39 I'M NOT SURE WHETHER THOSE WERE DETERMINED AS YOU NOTE BY, YOU KNOW, 
21:23:42 SOME SORT OF GUIDANCE BASED ON SIZE OR SOMETHING ELSE.

21:23:47 >> Mayor Mei:   MY UNDERSTANDING --

21:23:52 >> IF I MAY MAYOR YOU ARE REFERRING THE A PROVISION IN STATE LAW WHICH DOES 
21:23:56 LIMIT, DOES PLACE CAPS ON SALARIES BASED UPON POPULATION SIZE.

21:24:01 SO DIFFERENT CITIES HAVE DIFFERENT CAPS THAT ARE IMPOSED, WE'RE WITHIN OUR 
21:24:04 STATE LAW AUTHORITY AS WELL AS OUR LOCAL MUNICIPAL LAW AUTHORITY IN 
21:24:06 IMPLEMENTING THESE INCREASES.

21:24:15 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

21:24:18 AND I SEIZE NO OTHER COMMENTS FROM THE COUNCIL.

21:24:23 DOES ANYONE WANT TO MAKE A MOTION?

21:24:28 >> Councilmember Jones:   I'LL MOVE TO APPROVE.

21:24:31 >> Councilmember Keng:   I'LL SECOND THAT.

21:24:34 >> Mayor Mei:   MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER JONES AND SECOND BY COUNCILMEMBER 
21:24:35 KENG.

21:24:36 MAY I HAVE A ROLL CALL VOTE.

21:24:39 >> The Clerk:   YES, COUNCILMEMBER COX, AYE.

21:24:41 COUNCILMEMBER SHAO, AYE.

21:24:44 COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, AYE.

21:24:45 COUNCILMEMBER JONES, AYE.

21:24:48 COUNCILMEMBER KENG, AYE.

21:24:51 VICE MAYOR SALWAN, NAY.

21:24:53 MAYOR MEI.

21:24:59 >> Mayor Mei:   AYE SO THE MOTION PASSES WITH ONE NAY I THINK FROM VICE 
21:24:59 MAYOR SALWAN.

21:25:06 AND AT THIS TIME I SEE NO REPORT FROM THE CITY ATTORNEY OR COUNCILMEMBERS, 
21:25:12 AND SO, WHOOPS I SEE ONE FROM COUNCILMEMBER  JONES.

21:25:14 I THINK I KNOW WHAT IT IS.

21:25:15 >> Councilmember Jones:   THANK YOU, MADAM MAYOR.

21:25:20 SO FIRST OFF LET ME SAY I AM SORRY I MISSED ALL OF YOU GUYS ON THE 4th OF 
21:25:21 JULY PARADE.

21:25:23 LOOKS LIKE YOU HAD A GOOD TIME ON THE TROLLEY.

21:25:28 I HAD THE HONOR OF TRAVELING TO COLORADO TO HONOR OUR SCHOOL RESOURCE 
21:25:33 OFFICER UNIT WHO WAS RECOGNIZED BY THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SCHOOL 
21:25:36 RESOURCE OFFICERS AS WE DISCUSSED ON OUR JUNE 14th MEETING

21:25:39 I BELIEVE.

21:25:43 SO THE NATIONAL MEETING WAS EXTREMELY WELL ATTENDED AND I HAD THE PRIVILEGE 
21:25:49 OF PRESENTING OUR COUNCIL RESOLUTION AND CERTIFICATES OF RECOGNITION TO THE 
21:25:51 INDIVIDUAL OFFICERS AND THE SUPERVISOR.

21:25:54 AND I JUST WANT TO THANK THEM FOR EVERYTHING THAT THEY DO.

21:25:56 THANK YOU.

21:26:00 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

21:26:05 CONGRATULATIONS, AND CERTAINLY IT'S A WONDERFUL RECOGNITION FOR OUR FREMONT 
21:26:10 POLICE DEPARTMENT AND FOR THE SROS TO BE NOTED AS A NATIONAL RECOGNITION FOR 
21:26:11 THEIR STANDARDS.

21:26:16 AND ALSO IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE FREMONT SCHOOL DISTRICT.

21:26:17 COUNCILMEMBER KENG.

21:27:59 WITH OUR OTHER COMPANIES AND MANUFACTURERS AND BUSINESSES AND TO BE 
21:28:00 ABLE TO PROVIDE THAT.

21:28:05 THE OTHER, ONLY OTHER THING I WANTED TO MENTION IS THAT  BESIDES ASKING FOR
