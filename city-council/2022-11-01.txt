ITEM.

[Captioner] 19:07:52
CANCER AWARENESS MONTH.
AND ACCEPTING THE PROCLAMATION


[Captioner] 19:07:55
WILL BE RONNIE FONG.
AND ALSO

[Captioner] 19:07:59
 JUST LET YOU KNOW THAT
IN FRONT OF YOU, THERE IS A
SHEET

[Captioner] 19:08:02
 OF PAPER THAT ALSO DETAILS
SOME OF THE SYMPTOMS OF LUNG
CANCER.


[Captioner] 19:08:07
SO IF RON FONG COULD JOIN US AND
I'LL BE

[Captioner] 19:08:10
 HAPPY TO SHARE THIS.


[Captioner] 19:08:28
SORRY, IF YOU'RE ON THE ZOOM OR
ON THE PHONE, PLEASE MUTE
YOURSELF

[Captioner] 19:08:31
 IF YOU'RE NOT SPEAKING.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:08:37
WHEREAS, AWARENESS IS LOW

[Captioner] 19:08:42
 THAT
LUNG CANCER IS THE #1 CANCER
KILLER OF MEN AND WOMEN,


[Captioner] 19:08:46
KILLING MORE THAN 350 PER DAY;
WHEREAS, AWARENESS IS LOW THAT
LUNG CANCER KILLS TWICE AS MANY

[Captioner] 19:08:53

WOMEN AS DOES BREAST CANCER; AND
WHEREAS, AWARENESS IS LOW THAT


[Captioner] 19:08:57
ANYONE CAN GET LUNG CANCER –
YOUNG OR OLD, ATHLETIC OR
COUCH POTATO, RICH OR POOR,

[Captioner] 19:09:03

SMOKER OR NON-SMOKER; AND
WHEREAS, AWARENESS IS LOW THAT

[Captioner] 19:09:07

STOPPING SMOKING ALONE IS
INADEQUATE BECAUSE 20%

[Captioner] 19:09:11

WHO DIE NEVER SMOKED; AND
WHEREAS, EARLY DETECTION OF LUNG

[Captioner] 19:09:14

CANCER IS LOW BECAUSE THERE IS
NO EASY, AFFORDABLE WAY

[Captioner] 19:09:17

TO TEST LIKE A BREATHALYZER,
RESULTING IN CANCER BEING


[Captioner] 19:09:24
DISCOVERED TOO LATE; AND
WHEREAS, SURVIVAL IS LOW AT 5%

[Captioner] 19:09:27

SURVIVAL AT FIVE YEARS FOR STAGE
IV PATIENTS, LARGELY DUE

[Captioner] 19:09:30

TO LOW RESEARCH FUNDING; AND

[Captioner] 19:09:34

WHEREAS, RESEARCH FUNDING FOR
FINDING AND TREATING LUNG CANCER

[Captioner] 19:09:37

TRAILS FAR BEHIND FUNDING
FOR RESEARCH OF OTHER CANCERS;

[Captioner] 19:09:41

AND WHEREAS, WHILE THERE IS MUCH
HOPE FOR MORE SURVIVAL IN RECENT


[Captioner] 19:09:46
YEARS DUE TO DISCOVERIES
OF NEW THERAPIES FOR TREATMENTS
LIKE IMMUNOTHERAPY AND TARGETED


[Captioner] 19:09:52
THERAPIES AND BIOMARKER TESTING
THERE IS STILL LOW AWARENESS
THAT LESS THAN HALF OF PATIENTS

[Captioner] 19:09:55

DON’T SURVIVE ONE YEAR
NOW, THEREFORE, THE CITY COUNCIL

[Captioner] 19:09:58

OF THE CITY OF FREMONT, IN
RECOGNITION OF THE

[Captioner] 19:10:02

IMPORTANCE OF THE ONGOING
STRUGGLE AGAINST LUNG CANCER, DO

[Captioner] 19:10:05

DECLARE NOVEMBER AS LUNG CANCER
AWARENESS MONTH.

[Captioner] 19:10:11

AND I WANTED TO THANK RONNIE
FONG FOR

[Captioner] 19:10:13
 JOINING US THIS
EVENING.
WOULD YOU LIKE TO SHARE SOME


[Captioner] 19:10:16
WORDS, AND ALSO, AGAIN, MY


[Captioner] 19:10:20
DEEPEST CONDOLENCES OVER THE
YEARS THAT SO MANY OF MY DEAR
FRIENDS HAVE

[Captioner] 19:10:24
 PERISHED, INCLUDING
YOUR WIFE FROM THIS.
SO RON, WOULD YOU LIKE TO

[Captioner] 19:10:26
 ACCEPT
THIS?
>> THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR,


[Captioner] 19:10:30
COUNCIL AND STAFF.


[Captioner] 19:10:33
I'M HERE TODAY BECAUSE WE DON'T
TALK ABOUT

[Captioner] 19:10:36
 BRUNO.
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
AND BRUNO TODAY

[Captioner] 19:10:40
 IS MY CODE WORD
FOR LUNG CANCER.


[Captioner] 19:10:43
YOU KNOW,

[Captioner] 19:10:46
 HIV/AIDS CRISIS IN THE
80s, WE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT

[Captioner] 19:10:49
 HIV,
AND WE DON'T TALK ABOUT BRUNO,
BECAUSE WE'RE

[Captioner] 19:10:53
 STIGMATIZED.
THE DISEASE IS STIGMATIZED.
AND LIKE

[Captioner] 19:10:56
 IN EARLY AIDS CRISIS,
WE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT

[Captioner] 19:10:59
 BRUNO
BECAUSE MOST OF THE PATIENTS WHO
GOT SICK

[Captioner] 19:11:02
 DIED, AND THAT'S THE
TRUTH WITH LUNG CANCER AS WELL.


[Captioner] 19:11:05
SO I LIKE TO TALK ABOUT BRUNO
BECAUSE WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT


[Captioner] 19:11:09
BRUNO.
HE'S THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM.
THAT LUNG CANCER

[Captioner] 19:11:12
 KILLS MORE
WOMEN, TWICE AS MANY WOMEN

[Captioner] 19:11:15
 AS
DOES BREAST CANCER.
LUNG CANCER KILLS TWICE AS

[Captioner] 19:11:18
 MANY
BLACK FOLKS OF LUNG CANCER THAN
ANY

[Captioner] 19:11:21
 OTHER CANCER TYPE.
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT

[Captioner] 19:11:25
 LUNG CANCER
BECAUSE IT'S THE

[Captioner] 19:11:26
 NUMBER ONE
CANCER KILLER AMONG ASIAN
AMERICANS.


[Captioner] 19:11:30
SO LUNG CANCER IS A DEADLY
DISEASE BECAUSE OF

[Captioner] 19:11:33
 EARLY
DETECTION IS JUST VERY LOW.
THERE'S JUST

[Captioner] 19:11:36
 NO EASY WAY TO GET
PEOPLE

[Captioner] 19:11:39
 TO BE TESTED AND
SCREENED.


[Captioner] 19:11:45
AND SO WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT
BRUNO.


[Captioner] 19:11:49
JOAN DIED OF LUNG CANCER AT AGE
59.


[Captioner] 19:11:52
THE DOCTOR SAID,

[Captioner] 19:11:57
 HEY, YOU DON'T
LOOK SICK AND YOU'RE NOT A
SMOKER SO YOU DON'T

[Captioner] 19:12:00
 FIT ANY
PROFILE, YOU CAN'T POSSIBLY HAVE
LUNG CANCER.


[Captioner] 19:12:03
THESE ARE THE DOCTORS TALKING.
AND THE TRUTH

[Captioner] 19:12:06
 WAS, SHE DID.
SHE HAD CANCER IN HER SPINE, IN
HER

[Captioner] 19:12:09
 HIP, IN HER RIBS, AND IN HER
LUNGS.


[Captioner] 19:12:14
AND SO THAT'S SOBERING TO THINK
THAT YOU

[Captioner] 19:12:17
 COULD BE ASYMPTOMATIC
AND STILL HAVE LUNG

[Captioner] 19:12:20
 CANCER.
SO

[Captioner] 19:12:27
 LUNG CANCER, ANYONE CAN HAVE
LUNG CANCER IF THEY HAVE LUNGS.
I

[Captioner] 19:12:30
 PASSED OUT A BLUE SHEET TO THE
COUNCIL THAT SAYS THESE ARE

[Captioner] 19:12:34
 SOME
SYMPTOMS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE
THAT IF YOU HAD ANY OF

[Captioner] 19:12:37
 THESE
SEVEN SYMPTOMS, YOU MIGHT HAVE
LUNG CANCER AND YOU SHOULD

[Captioner] 19:12:40
 GO
SEE A DOCTOR.
IF YOU HAVE BLOOD IN YOUR LUNGS,


[Captioner] 19:12:43
IN YOUR COUGH, THAT IS, IF YOU
HAVE A RECURRING

[Captioner] 19:12:47
 RESPIRATORY
INFECTIONS THAT MIGHT LAST
MONTHS AND MONTHS AND MONTHS.


[Captioner] 19:12:50
IF YOU HAVE A COUGH THAT JUST
SEEMS TO BE DIFFERENT OR IS NEW
AND

[Captioner] 19:12:53
 JUST SEEMS TO LAST AND LAST
AND LAST.
IF YOU HAVE

[Captioner] 19:12:56
 ACHE IN YOUR
SHOULDER OR YOUR CHEST

[Captioner] 19:13:00
 OR YOUR
BACK, THAT COULD BE LUNG CANCER
BECAUSE LUNG CANCER TENDS TO GO


[Captioner] 19:13:03
TO YOUR BONES.
IF YOU HAVE TROUBLE BREATHING.


[Captioner] 19:13:08
OR HOARSENESS OR WHEEZING OR
EXHAUSTION.


[Captioner] 19:13:13
THOSE THINGS SPELL OUT BREATH
AND

[Captioner] 19:13:16
 THAT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU
SHOULD REMEMBER, LUNG CANCER IS
ALL

[Captioner] 19:13:19
 ABOUT US BREATHING AND
LIVING

[Captioner] 19:13:22
 LIFE.
JOAN WAS A WARRIOR.


[Captioner] 19:13:26
SHE FOUGHT THIS DISEASE 48
MONTHS, FAR EXCEEDING

[Captioner] 19:13:30
 THE MEDIAN
SURVIVAL RATE OF 8 MONTHS.


[Captioner] 19:13:36
SO I JUST WISH THAT NO ONE ELSE
WOULD HAVE LUNG CANCER AND HAVE


[Captioner] 19:13:39
TO ENDURE THE TRAGEDY THAT THIS
CAN CAUSE YOU.


[Captioner] 19:13:44
SO PLEASE TALK ABOUT BRUNO THIS
MONTH.
PLEASE TALK ABOUT LUNG

[Captioner] 19:13:47
 CANCER.
THAT ANYONE CAN GET

[Captioner] 19:13:52
 IT.
OVER 350 PEOPLE A DAY IN AMERICA
DIE OF IT RIGHT

[Captioner] 19:13:55
 NOW.
SO IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU VOTE
BLUE OR YOU

[Captioner] 19:13:58
 VOTE RED.
IF YOU'RE ATHLETE OR COUCH
POTATO.


[Captioner] 19:14:01
IF YOU'RE UNDER 40 OR OVER 40.


[Captioner] 19:14:05
IF YOU HAVE LUNGS, YOU CAN GET
LUNG CANCER, SO ON BEHALF OF


[Captioner] 19:14:08
THAT, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR
RECOGNIZING LUNG

[Captioner] 19:14:11
 CANCER
AWARENESS MONTH.
OH, AND THIS WHITE RIBBON BEHIND


[Captioner] 19:14:14
ME IS HANDMADE BY OTHER LUNG
CANCER SURVIVORS AND

[Captioner] 19:14:18
 DOCTORS AND
JUST ADVOCATES THAT THESE

[Captioner] 19:14:21
 WOODEN
RIBBONS THAT WE STARTED TO MAKE
THIS LAST YEAR DURING THE


[Captioner] 19:14:28
PANDEMIC ARE TO SHOW THAT YOU'RE
NOT ALONE.


[Captioner] 19:14:31
SOMEBODY WILL THINK THEY'RE
ALONE WHEN YOU GET LUNG CANCER.
WE WANT YOU TO

[Captioner] 19:14:34
 KNOW THAT NO,
YOU'RE NOT ALONE, WE'RE AWARE
YOU CAN GET SICK.


[Captioner] 19:14:37
SO IF ANYONE WANTS A LUNG CANCER
RIBBON,

[Captioner] 19:14:40
 PLEASE CONTACT ME AND
WE'LL MAKE SOME FOR YOU.
THANK YOU VERY

[Captioner] 19:14:42
 MUCH, MADAME
MAYOR.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:14:46
THANK YOU FOR YOUR LOVELY
TRIBUTE.


[Captioner] 19:14:49

[Captioner] 19:18:13
LET'S NOT -- I REALLY APPRECIATE

 ORGANIZATIONS
WHO ARE WORKING DAY AND NIGHT TO
ADDRESS SUCH INCIDENTS AND


[Captioner] 19:18:20
PROVIDING SUPPORT, LOVE AND
CARE.
BY THE WAY,

[Captioner] 19:18:23
 FREMONT HAS TOPPED
THE LIST OF HAPPIEST PLACES TO


[Captioner] 19:18:26
LIVE IN THE ENTIRE UNITED STATES
OF AMERICA.
LET'S SPREAD

[Captioner] 19:18:30
 THE HAPPINESS AND
LOVE, AND MAKE THE WORLD A


[Captioner] 19:18:33
BETTER PLACE.
WITHOUT THIS THOUGHT, WITHOUT


[Captioner] 19:18:36
THESE ACTIONS, I DON'T THINK WE
WOULD BE ABLE

[Captioner] 19:18:40
 TO ACCOMPLISH, WE
WOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE THE ENTIRE
UNITED

[Captioner] 19:18:43
 STATES, ENTIRE WORLD WHAT
FREMONT RIGHT NOW

[Captioner] 19:18:46
 STANDS FOR.
SO THANK YOU, MADAME

[Captioner] 19:18:48
 MAYOR, AND
THANK YOU ENTIRE CITY COUNCIL
AND STAFF.


[Captioner] 19:18:51
REALLY APPRECIATE ALL THE
EFFORTS FOR US TO MAKE SURE THAT
FREMONT IS REALLY THE HAPPIEST


[Captioner] 19:18:55
PLACE.


[Captioner] 19:18:57
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU FOR
JOINING US THIS EVENING.
I'M GOING TO AT LEAST SHARE WITH


[Captioner] 19:19:00
PEOPLE, TOO, THAT COMING UP IN
THE HOLIDAY SEASON, I APPRECIATE
THAT

[Captioner] 19:19:04
 EVERY YEAR OUR CITY ALSO
HAS A TRADITION OF INTERFAITH


[Captioner] 19:19:07
THANKSGIVING WORSHIP, AND SO FOR
THOSE WHO ARE INTERESTED, I KNOW


[Captioner] 19:19:10
THAT IT'S A JOINT EFFORT BETWEEN
MANY DIFFERENT GROUPS INCLUDING


[Captioner] 19:19:13
LED BY THE TRI-CITY INTERFAITH
COUNCIL, SO HOPEFULLY

[Captioner] 19:19:16
 WE'LL BE
CONTINUING THAT TRADITION.
I THINK IT'S BOTH IN PERSON AND


[Captioner] 19:19:20
ONLINE.
NEXT IS

[Captioner] 19:19:23
 ITEM 4A, ORAL
COMMUNICATIONS.


[Captioner] 19:19:29
I WANT TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY
SPEAKERS FOR ORAL COMMUNICATIONS
THIS

[Captioner] 19:19:32
 EVENING.
ANY PERSON DESIRE TO SPEAK ON A
MATTER WHICH IS NOT

[Captioner] 19:19:35
 SCHEDULED ON
THIS AGENDA MAY DO SO UNDER ORAL


[Captioner] 19:19:38
COMMUNICATIONS SECTION OF PUBLIC
COMMUNICATIONS.
COMMUNICATIONS RECEIVED

[Captioner] 19:19:41
 VIA
EMAIL WILL BE PLACED ON FILE AND
CONSIDERED PART OF THE PUBLIC


[Captioner] 19:19:44
RECORD.
MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WISHING TO
SPEAK MAY DO SO NOW BY

[Captioner] 19:19:47
 PRESSING
THE RAISE HAND ICON OR DIALING
STAR NINE.


[Captioner] 19:19:51
IF NOT NOTED ON THE ZOOM SCREEN,


[Captioner] 19:19:54
PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME WHEN
SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF AN
ORGANIZATION,

[Captioner] 19:19:58
 PLEASE 

[Captioner] 19:20:02
 STATE THE
NAME OF THE ORGANIZATION YOU'RE
REPRESENTING.


[Captioner] 19:20:06
ARE THERE SPEAKERS?
>> Ms. Gauthier: CURRENTLY
THERE'S JUST ONE, KELLY

[Captioner] 19:20:08
 ABREU.
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY.
WE'LL GIVE THREE MINUTES THEN.


[Captioner] 19:20:12
>> THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:20:16
SO WHEN THE CITY IS

[Captioner] 19:20:21
 LOOKING AT
POSTING A LEASE RENEWAL AT


[Captioner] 19:20:25
MISSION PEAK, IT

[Captioner] 19:20:30
 SEEMS LIKE
THEY'RE GOING TO BE GIVING
INTERESTED ORGANIZATIONS

[Captioner] 19:20:33
 WHAT,
72 HOURS NOTICE, 72 HOURS TO
REVIEW THE AGREEMENT.


[Captioner] 19:20:37
WELL, THAT'S VERY GENEROUS OF
THE STAFF OF THE CITY.


[Captioner] 19:20:45
WHEN OVER IN LOS ANGELES, SOME
OF YOU MAY HAVE

[Captioner] 19:20:48
 NOTICED SOME
CITY COUNCILMEMBERS GOT INTO A
LITTLE BIT OF TROUBLE

[Captioner] 19:20:51
 WITH
RACISM, AND THEY WERE

[Captioner] 19:20:54
 STRIPPED
OF MOST OF THEIR COMMITTEE
ASSIGNMENTS BUT NOT ALL OF THEM.


[Captioner] 19:20:57
THEY WERE LEFT -- THERE'S A
REQUIREMENT THAT THEY

[Captioner] 19:21:02
 HAVE TO
STAY ON CERTAIN COMMITTEES,
REMAIN MEMBERS

[Captioner] 19:21:05
 OF CERTAIN
COMMITTEES, AT LEAST ONE, I


[Captioner] 19:21:09
BELIEVE, SO THEY FOUND A
COMMITTEE SOMEWHERE, YOU KNOW,
THE COMMITTEE

[Captioner] 19:21:15
 FOR THE
AGRICULTURAL FAIR OR WHATEVER,
THEY FOUND A

[Captioner] 19:21:18
 COMMITTEE THAT IS
SO INACTIVE THAT IT HARDLY EVER
MEETS, AND IF

[Captioner] 19:21:21
 THE SAME THING
EVER WERE TO HAPPEN IN FREMONT,
I'M

[Captioner] 19:21:27
 SURE THAT WE HAVE THE
COMMITTEE LINED UP RIGHT HERE.
IT'S CALLED THE EAST

[Captioner] 19:21:31
 BAY
REGIONAL PARK DISTRICT LIAISON
COMMITTEE OF THE CITY

[Captioner] 19:21:34
 OF FREMONT
THAT IS JUST WAITING FOR MEMBERS
BECAUSE

[Captioner] 19:21:37
 IT NEVER -- HARDLY EVER
MEETS, AND IF SOMETHING DOES


[Captioner] 19:21:40
COME UP THAT INVOLVES THAT
LIAISON

[Captioner] 19:21:44
 RELATIONSHIP, THAT
COMMITTEE WON'T BE CALLED, WON'T
BE CALLED

[Captioner] 19:21:48
 TO MEET AND WON'T
REVIEW ANYTHING, SO IT WILL

[Captioner] 19:21:51
 COME
STRAIGHT TO THE CITY COUNCIL AND
WILL BYPASS THAT

[Captioner] 19:21:54
 COMMITTEE.
IT'S A VIRTUALLY POWERLESS AND
WORTHLESS

[Captioner] 19:21:58
 COMMITTEE.
AND THEN WHEN THESE LEASES DO
COME UP, YOU KNOW, THERE WAS

[Captioner] 19:22:01
 A
LITTLE BIT

[Captioner] 19:22:05
 OF A QUESTION, SHOULD
WE HAVE A 25-YEAR LEASE?


[Captioner] 19:22:09
WELL, A COUPLE OF, YOU KNOW,
REFERENCE POINTS FOR THAT.


[Captioner] 19:22:13
THERE'S AN ARDENWOOD HISTORICAL
FARM THAT'S LEASED WITH THE

[Captioner] 19:22:15
 SAME
ORGANIZATION IN FREMONT.
CITY OF FREMONT.


[Captioner] 19:22:18
NOBODY HAS EVER HEARD OF IT, BY
IT'S CALLED ARDENWOOD

[Captioner] 19:22:22
 HISTORIC
FARM.
THAT LEASE IS, WHAT,

[Captioner] 19:22:25
 ABOUT 40 OR
50 YEARS?
40 OR 50

[Captioner] 19:22:28
 YEAR LEASE, AND WAITING
TO

[Captioner] 19:22:31
 HEAR THE COMPLAINTS THAT
THAT'S TOO LONG.


[Captioner] 19:22:35
THIS LEASE AT MISSION PEAK,

[Captioner] 19:22:38
 THE
NEGOTIATIONS BEGAN THREE YEARS
AGO,

[Captioner] 19:22:42
 LEASE NEGOTIATIONS BEGAN
THREE YEARS AGO, AND THE LEASE


[Captioner] 19:22:45
EXPIRED, WHAT, 2 1/2 YEARS AGO?


[Captioner] 19:22:48
SO YOU KNOW, IF WE'RE GOING TO
HAVE

[Captioner] 19:22:51
 NEGOTIATIONS DRAG ON THIS
LONG OVER SOMETHING THAT WAS


[Captioner] 19:22:55
SUPPOSED TO BE CONCLUDED, AN


[Captioner] 19:22:58
AGREEMENT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
CONCLUDED TWO YEARS AGO, THEN


[Captioner] 19:23:01
HAVING A SHORT-TERM LEASE WOULD
MAKE NO SENSE.
IT WOULD BE

[Captioner] 19:23:04
 IN CONSTANT
NEGOTIATIONS.
BUT THAT WOULD BE THE WHOLE


[Captioner] 19:23:07
PURPOSE, RIGHT, OF HAVING THAT
FIVE-YEAR LEASE, RIGHT?
SO WE

[Captioner] 19:23:10
 CAN CONSTANTLY NEGOTIATE.


[Captioner] 19:23:15
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
ARE THERE ANY OTHER SPEAKERS?


[Captioner] 19:23:22
>> Ms. Gauthier: I'M SEEING NO
OTHER HANDS RAISED FOR ORAL
COMMUNICATIONS, MADAME

[Captioner] 19:23:25
 MAYOR.
>> Mayor Mei: AT THIS TIME, I'M
CLOSING ORAL COMMUNICATIONS.


[Captioner] 19:23:28
>> Ms. Gauthier: SORRY, WE JUST
HAD ANOTHER ONE POP

[Captioner] 19:23:32
 UP.


[Captioner] 19:23:35
MARI-LYN HARRIS.


[Captioner] 19:23:41
>> Mayor Mei: WELCOME, MARI-LYN.
>>

[Captioner] 19:23:44
 I'M NOT SURE, THANK YOU,
MADAME MAYOR AND CITY

[Captioner] 19:23:48
 COUNCIL, I
WASN'T SURE IF I SHOULD SPEAK
NOW OR NOT BUT I JUST WANTED TO


[Captioner] 19:23:51
BRING UP THE FACT THAT IT IS --
DAY ON NOVEMBER

[Captioner] 19:23:55
 THE 13TH SO I
FIND IT INTERESTING THAT WE HAVE
A

[Captioner] 19:23:58
 WEEK FREE OF HARASSMENT.
BUT ANYWAY,

[Captioner] 19:24:01
 SO MAYBE IT WOULD
HELP KICK IT OFF.


[Captioner] 19:24:04
SO ORAL KINDNESS IS NOVEMBER THE
13TH AND I'M

[Captioner] 19:24:08
 DOING A DAY OF
CATCHING PEOPLE

[Captioner] 19:24:11
 DOING KIND
DEEDS

[Captioner] 19:24:16
 IN FREMONT AND IT'S ON THE
SAME DAY, SO I HOPE I

[Captioner] 19:24:19
 HAVE THE
CITY COUNCIL OUT HELPING ME


[Captioner] 19:24:23
CATCH PEOPLE DOING KIND THINGS.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:24:26
I'D CERTAINLY LIKE TO CATCH MORE
PEOPLE DOING KIND THINGS.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:24:35
NEXT -- ARE THERE ANY OTHER
SPEAKERS?
OKAY, AT THIS TIME I'M CLOSING


[Captioner] 19:24:38

AND WE'RE GOING TO

[Captioner] 19:26:00

>> Mayor Mei: THANK

[Captioner] 19:27:21
 YOU.
AT THIS TIME,

[Captioner] 19:27:23
 PLEASE HAVE YOU
VOTE.
I THINK WE ALREADY HAVE A MOTION


[Captioner] 19:27:26
AND SECOND.


[Captioner] 19:27:36
SO THE MOTION TO APPROVE

[Captioner] 19:27:39
 THE
22 -- 2022 CALIFORNIA BUILDING
STANDARDS CODE ADOPTION AS WELL


[Captioner] 19:27:43
AS THE RESOLUTION IS PASSING
UNANIMOUSLY.


[Captioner] 19:27:51
AND AT THIS TIME, I SEE NO
REPORT FROM THE CITY ATTORNEY

[Captioner] 19:27:54
 OR
OTHER BUSINESS.
I HAVE

[Captioner] 19:27:59
 A REFERRAL TO AN ADVISORY
BODY, WHICH IS -- I'D LIKE

[Captioner] 19:28:02
 TO --
IT'S ITEM 8A, WHICH IS

[Captioner] 19:28:06
 THE
REFERRAL TO THE ECONOMIC
DEVELOPMENT

[Captioner] 19:28:10
 ADVISORY COMMISSION
FOR THE

[Captioner] 19:28:13
 REPRESENTATIVE FOR
COMMERCIAL INDUSTRIAL, AND
THAT'S TO

[Captioner] 19:28:16
 APPOINT KARI PAIGE,
AND DO

[Captioner] 19:28:19
 I HAVE ANY MOTION OR
QUESTION?
>> Ms. Gauthier: WE HAVE A


[Captioner] 19:28:22
PUBLIC SPEAKER.
>> Mayor Mei: SURE.
COULD WE INVITE THE

[Captioner] 19:28:25
 PUBLIC
SPEAKER, PLEASE.


[Captioner] 19:28:30
>> YEAH, IF YOU READ THIS


[Captioner] 19:28:33
REFERRAL, AND BY THE WAY, IT'S
WONDERFUL TO HAVE MEMBERS

[Captioner] 19:28:36
 ON
THIS COMMITTEE

[Captioner] 19:28:39
 THAT SHARE THEIR
TIME AND WORK ON THESE ISSUES

[Captioner] 19:28:42
 OF
BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT.


[Captioner] 19:28:45
SO IT'S NICE TO HAVE THIS
COMMITTEE AND HAVE PEOPLE


[Captioner] 19:28:49
STAFFING IT, BUT LOOK AT THE
APPOINTMENT SHEET.


[Captioner] 19:28:52
IT SAYS THAT THE TERM EXPIRES


[Captioner] 19:28:55
ABOUT 60 DAYS FROM NOW, AT THE
END OF THIS

[Captioner] 19:28:58
 YEAR?
SO YOU KNOW,

[Captioner] 19:29:02
 IF THIS ADVISORY
BODY IS THAT IMPORTANT THAT IT


[Captioner] 19:29:05
DESERVES TO HAVE MEMBERS ON IT,
WHY DON'T YOU APPOINT THE
MEMBERS FOR

[Captioner] 19:29:08
 A TERM THAT'S LONGER
THAN 60 DAYS SO

[Captioner] 19:29:12
 THAT THE PEOPLE
CAN FIND OUT WHERE THE BATHROOMS


[Captioner] 19:29:16
ARE AND FIND OUT WHERE THEIR
SEATS ARE AND GET SOME

[Captioner] 19:29:19
 WORK
DONE, AND NOT JUST HAVE THEM
THERE FOR 60 DAYS.


[Captioner] 19:29:22
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:29:24
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
I SEE THE CLERK HAS A POINT OF
CLARIFICATION.


[Captioner] 19:29:27
DID YOU WANT TO CLARIFY?
>> Ms. Gauthier: YES, MADAME
MAYOR.


[Captioner] 19:29:31
MS. PAIGE, IF SHE IS
SUCCESSFULLY APPOINTED THIS
EVENING, IS

[Captioner] 19:29:35
 FILLING THE
REMAINDER OF A TERM OF A

[Captioner] 19:29:38

VACANCY.
THAT'S BEEN OUR

[Captioner] 19:29:41
 PROCESS
THROUGHOUT MY TENURE HERE, AND
SO WE WILL

[Captioner] 19:29:44
 MAKE THE -- IF YOU
CHOOSE TO MAKE THE APPOINTMENT
THROUGH THE

[Captioner] 19:29:47
 END OF THE YEAR AND
IF MS. PAIGE IS STILL

[Captioner] 19:29:50
 INTERESTED
AT THE END OF THE YEAR, YOU CAN
REAPPOINT HER FOR A FULL

[Captioner] 19:29:53

FOUR-YEAR TERM.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU FOR THAT


[Captioner] 19:29:56
POINT OF CLARIFICATION.
I WAS GOING

[Captioner] 19:29:59
 TO NOTE THAT TOO BUT
I HAD SAW THAT YOU RAISED YOUR
HAND.


[Captioner] 19:30:01
>> Councilmember Jones: I'LL
MOVE TO APPROVE.
>> Mayor Mei: MOVED BY


[Captioner] 19:30:04
COUNCILMEMBER JONES AND SECONDED

OKAY.


[Captioner] 19:30:09
SO PLEASE VOTE.


[Captioner] 19:30:38
THANK YOU.
CONGRATULATIONS TO

[Captioner] 19:30:50
 MS KARI
PAIGE.
I'M HOPING

[Captioner] 19:30:53
 AFTER 60 DAYS SHE
STILL WILL WANT TO BE PART OF


[Captioner] 19:30:56
THE COMMISSION.
AT THIS TIME I'LL TURN TO

[Captioner] 19:30:59
 THE
COUNCIL ON REPORTS FOR COMMITTEE
MEETINGS THEY HAVE ATTENDED ON


[Captioner] 19:31:02
BEHALF OF THE CITY OF FREMONT,
IF THERE'S ANYTHING

[Captioner] 19:31:05
 TO REPORT
OUT?


[Captioner] 19:31:11
I SEE NONE BUT I WAS JUST GOING
TO REALLY QUICKLY

[Captioner] 19:31:15
 ALSO
CONGRATULATE OHLONE COLLEGE ON
THEIR 50TH YEAR OF

[Captioner] 19:31:18
 THEIR DEAF
PROGRAM.
AND SO IT'S SOMETHING THAT I


[Captioner] 19:31:21
WOULD LOVE TO BE ABLE TO PARTNER
WITH AS WE MOVE FORWARD, AND I
THINK

[Captioner] 19:31:24
 IT'S IMPORTANT, AND THEN


[Captioner] 19:31:27
OUR ALAMEDA COUNTY
TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION VOTED
TO

[Captioner] 19:31:32
 CONTINUE OUR EXECUTIVE
DIRECTOR'S CONTRACT, AND

[Captioner] 19:31:37
 I THINK
AS FAR AS THIS IS CONCERNED, I
THINK THAT'S IT

[Captioner] 19:31:42
 FOR US FOR
COMMITTEES THAT ARE

[Captioner] 19:31:46
 RELATED TO
OUR COUNCIL ROLES.
I JUST WANTED

[Captioner] 19:31:50
 TO ENCOURAGE
EVERYONE THAT IN THIS MOMENT,
WHEN

[Captioner] 19:31:53
 WE'RE LOOKING AT UNITED
AGAINST HATE AWARENESS WEEK AND
WORLD

[Captioner] 19:31:57
 KINDNESS DAY TO ENCOURAGE
PEOPLE TO BE KIND TO ONE
ANOTHER, AND

[Captioner] 19:32:01
 ALSO IN GENERAL, TO
BE THOUGHTFUL AND GET OUT

[Captioner] 19:32:03
 TO
VOTE, WHICH IS IMPORTANT FOR YOU
TO MAKE YOUR VOICE HEARD.


[Captioner] 19:32:07
SO THANK YOU SO MUCH, TO BE
WELL, TO BE SAFE, TO BE

[Captioner] 19:32:10
 JUST AND
TO BE KIND, AND WE WILL CALL THE


[Captioner] 19:32:13
MEETING TO A CLOSE AT 7:32 P.M.


[Captioner] 19:32:16
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:32:20
MEETING ADJOURNED.
