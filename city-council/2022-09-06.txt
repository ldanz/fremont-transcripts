 READ THE ORDINANCE, PLEASE.
>> 

[Captioner] 19:05:14
ITEM 2C ON THE CONSENT CALENDAR IS A

[Captioner] 19:05:17
 SECOND READING AND ADOPTION OF AN ORDINANCE OF THE FREMONT MUNICIPAL

[Captioner] 19:05:21

>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU

[Captioner] 19:05:33
.
AND THAT'S AFTER THE

[Captioner] 19:05:38
 SEATING NOVEMBER 8TH, 2022.
SO WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND.


[Captioner] 19:05:41
ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE.
NORMALLY WE'D VOTE BUT I THINK WE HAVE

[Captioner] 19:05:44
 ONE COUNCILMEMBER WHO'S DIALING IN.


[Captioner] 19:05:48
>> Ms. Gauthier: COUNCILMEMBER COX, AYE.
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN,

[Captioner] 19:05:51
 AYE BUT 5C IS NAY, JUST LIKE LAST TIME

[Captioner] 19:05:55
.


[Captioner] 19:05:58
>> Ms. Gauthier: 5C?


[Captioner] 19:06:03
COUNCILMEMBER SHAO, AYE.
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN

[Captioner] 19:06:07
,

[Captioner] 19:06:12
.
COUNCILMEMBER JONES, AYE.
VICE MAYOR KENG, AYE

[Captioner] 19:06:15
.
MAYOR MEI, AYE.
>> Mayor Mei: 

[Captioner] 19:06:18
SO THE CONSENT ITEMS PASS EXCEPT

[Captioner] 19:06:22
 FOR A RECUSAL ON ONE ITEM FOR

[Captioner] 19:06:25
 COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN.


[Captioner] 19:06:31

>> Ms. Gauthier: IT'S A NAY, NOT

[Captioner] 19:06:34
 AN ABSTENTION, IS THAT CORRECT?
>> 

[Captioner] 19:06:36
CORRECT.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU FOR THAT CLARIFICATION.


[Captioner] 19:06:41
SO NEXT ON THIS AGENDA IS THE PUBLIC

[Captioner] 19:06:45
 COMMUNICATIONS.
I THOUGHT I HAD SOME

[Captioner] 19:06:48
 CEREMONIAL, BUT I GUESS NOT THIS TIME.


[Captioner] 19:06:51
SO THAT'S PUBLIC

[Captioner] 19:06:54
 COMMUNICATIONS, ITEMS THAT ARE NOT AGENDIZED THIS EVENING ON THE CALENDAR.


[Captioner] 19:06:58
ANY PERSON DESIRING TO SPEAK ON A MATTER WHICH IS NOT SCHEDULED ON THE

[Captioner] 19:07:01
 AGENDA MAY DO SO UNDER ORAL COMMUNICATIONS

[Captioner] 19:07:04
 SECTION OF THE PUBLIC
COMMUNICATIONS.
AND

[Captioner] 19:07:08
 MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC MAY DO SO RIGHT NOW BY PRESSING RAISE HAND

[Captioner] 19:07:11
 ICON IF YOU'RE ON ZOOM OR IF YOU'RE DIALING IN, BY PRESSING STAR 

[Captioner] 19:07:14
NINE.


[Captioner] 19:07:19
ARE THERE ANY SPEAKERS,  MS. GAUTHIER, CITY CLERK?


[Captioner] 19:07:28
>> Ms. Gauthier: 

[Captioner] 19:07:34
MR. HINDS HAS JUST RAISED HIS HAND.
>> HELLO,

[Captioner] 19:07:37
 EVERYONE.
IT'S COOL TO SEE PEOPLE BACK IN COUNCIL CHAMBERS.


[Captioner] 19:07:40
SOMEHOW I MISSED THE SCHEDULE OF HOW THESE

[Captioner] 19:07:43
 ARE BEING PHASED BACK IN.
I KNOW YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO RESPOND

[Captioner] 19:07:46
 IN PUBLIC COMMUNICATIONS BUT SOMEWHERE IN THE MEETING, COULD YOU SNEAK

[Captioner] 19:07:50
 IN AN UPDATE ON WHAT THE NEXT STAGES ARE
OF RETURNING TO

[Captioner] 19:07:53
 HYBRID OR IN-PERSON MEETINGS?
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:07:58
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:08:08
NEXT SPEAKER.
>> Ms. Gauthier: THERE ARE NO OTHER SPEAKERS AT THIS TIME

[Captioner] 19:08:10
.
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:08:14
AT THIS TIME, WE ARE GLAD JUST TO SEE OUR COUNCILMEMBERS  RETURNING AND

[Captioner] 19:08:17
 WE WILL CERTAINLY UPDATE THE PUBLIC AS SOON AS WE

[Captioner] 19:08:21
 ARE MAKING ANY CHANGES
TO ADDITIONAL

[Captioner] 19:08:24
 IN-PERSON CONTACT.


[Captioner] 19:08:30
NEXT ON THE AGENDA ARE ITEMS REMOVED FROM THE

[Captioner] 19:08:33
 CONSENT CALENDAR.
I BELIEVE CHRIS HAD PULLED THREE ITEMS, ITEM

[Captioner] 19:08:36
 2F, 2G, AND 2J.


[Captioner] 19:08:41
WELCOME, CHRIS.


[Captioner] 19:08:46
>> THANK YOU.
GOOD TO SEE YOU GUYS ALL BACK IN THE COUNCIL ROOM TOO.


[Captioner] 19:08:51
OH, LET'S SEE.


[Captioner] 19:08:57
WOW.
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO STOP USING

[Captioner] 19:09:00
 USING -- F IS NOT NEEDED.
SO LET'S SEE

[Captioner] 19:09:04
.
THE OTHER ONES YOU REMOVED FROM CONSENT CALENDAR

[Captioner] 19:09:07
?
I'LL GO IN ORDER.
>> Mayor Mei: G AS IN GEORGE

[Captioner] 19:09:10
 AND J AS IN JACK.
>> PURCHASE OF VEHICLES.
SO YOU

[Captioner] 19:09:13
 NOTE YOU'RE NOT BUYING ELECTRIC VEHICLES HERE THEN YOU

[Captioner] 19:09:16
 SAY
YOU'RE EXEMPT FROM CEQA, BUT I THINK IF

[Captioner] 19:09:20
 EVERYONE'S -- CITY
OF CALIFORNIA SAID THEY HAD

[Captioner] 19:09:23
 THE RIGHT TO CHANGE THE FEDERAL
EMISSIONS BECAUSE IT'S SPECIAL IN

[Captioner] 19:09:27
 CALIFORNIA AND WE NEED TO
REDUCE CARBON DIOXIDE AND OTHER

[Captioner] 19:09:30
 EMISSIONS PUT OUT BY VEHICLES,
YET THE CITY COUNCIL IS GOING AHEAD

[Captioner] 19:09:33
 WITH SPENDING MORE THAN A
MILLION DOLLARS ON BUYING NEW VEHICLE

[Captioner] 19:09:36
S, AND THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO
BE ANYTHING IN HERE

[Captioner] 19:09:40
 THEY EVEN NOTE THAT THEY'RE NOT BUYING
ELECTRIC VEHICLES BECAUSE OF LACK

[Captioner] 19:09:43
 OF INFRASTRUCTURE.


[Captioner] 19:09:46
SO I THINK THEY SHOULD HOLD BACK ON

[Captioner] 19:09:49
 BUYING THE VEHICLES UNTIL YOU
CAN START TO BUY

[Captioner] 19:09:52
 ELECTRIC VEHICLES WHERE THAT PURPOSE

[Captioner] 19:09:56
  IS --
MAKES SENSE.
THAT'S ALL I HAVE ON THAT

[Captioner] 19:10:00
.
YOU WANT ME TO GO

[Captioner] 19:10:03
 ON TO THE NEXT ONE?
>> Mayor Mei: YES, PLEASE.


[Captioner] 19:10:11
POLICE MATTERS --

[Captioner] 19:10:16
 MEMORANDUM.
I COULDN'T FIND WHERE THAT MEMORANDUM IS PUBLIC

[Captioner] 19:10:19
 AND ALSO IT WENT
UP TO AN AGREEMENT THAT

[Captioner] 19:10:22
 WAS DONE TODAY.
SO IF YOU'RE SAYING THAT

[Captioner] 19:10:25
 IT'S AN AGREEMENT THAT WAS FINALIZED
TODAY, THERE'S NO WAY FOR THE PUBLIC

[Captioner] 19:10:28
 TO REVIEW IT, AND THEREFORE
I

[Captioner] 19:10:31
 DON'T THINK YOU GUYS SHOULD BE VOTING ON IT UNTIL IT'S
AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC SINCE YOU

[Captioner] 19:10:34
 GUYS ARE CALLING OUT A DATE OF
SEPTEMBER 6 WHEN THE AGREEMENT WAS REACHED

[Captioner] 19:10:38
.
THAT'S WHAT I HAVE TO SAY ON THAT.


[Captioner] 19:10:42
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:10:46
AT THIS TIME, I'LL TURN IT BACK TO THE COUNCIL OR STAFF IF

[Captioner] 19:10:49

THERE'S ANY QUESTIONS.


[Captioner] 19:10:55
IF NOT, THERE'S STILL THREE  ITEMS THAT NEED TO BE APPROVED
ON THE

[Captioner] 19:10:58
 CONSENT CALENDAR.
2F, 2G

[Captioner] 19:11:01
 AND 2J.


[Captioner] 19:11:05
>> Vice Mayor Salwan: MOVE APPROVAL.
>> Mayor Mei: MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN AND SECONDED BY

[Captioner] 19:11:08

COUNCILMEMBER COX.
ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE.


[Captioner] 19:11:13
>> Ms. Gauthier: YES, MADAME MAYOR.


[Captioner] 19:11:16
COUNCILMEMBER COX.


[Captioner] 19:11:19
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN, AYE.
COUNCILMEMBER SHAO,

[Captioner] 19:11:22
 AYE.
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN

[Captioner] 19:11:26
.


[Captioner] 19:11:29
COUNCILMEMBER JONES, AYE.
VICE MAYOR KENG,

[Captioner] 19:11:32
 AYE.
MAYOR MEI, AYE.
SO

[Captioner] 19:11:35
 THE CONSENT CALENDAR FOR  ITEMS 2F,

[Captioner] 19:11:38
 G AND J PASS
UNANIMOUSLY.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:11:48
NEXT IS ITEM 7A AS IN

[Captioner] 19:11:51
 APPLE, AND THAT IS THE STREET RACING AND
SIDESHOW

[Captioner] 19:11:54
 ORDINANCE.
THERE IS NO PRESENTATION FORMALLY

[Captioner] 19:11:59
 TONIGHT, BUT POLICE

[Captioner] 19:12:02
 LIEUTENANT
JOHN HARTNETT IS AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS.


[Captioner] 19:12:06
AND COMMENTS OR IF THERE'S ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE 
COUNCILMEMBERS

[Captioner] 19:12:09
.


[Captioner] 19:12:12
ARE THERE ANY -- I'M GOING TO OPEN THE PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD.


[Captioner] 19:12:15
I GUESS -- AND ARE THERE

[Captioner] 19:12:19
 ANY SPEAKERS FOR THE PUBLIC COMMENT?


[Captioner] 19:12:28
>> Ms. Gauthier: CHRIS.
ARE WE DOING 3 MINUTES, MADAME MAYOR?
>> Mayor Mei: YES, THAT'S

[Captioner] 19:12:31
 FINE.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:12:34
>> THANK YOU.
THIS --

[Captioner] 19:12:37
 YOU'RE ADDING ONCE MORE A CITY ORDINANCE YOU MAY OR

[Captioner] 19:12:41
 MAY
NOT ENFORCE WHEN YOU SHOULD GO AND LOOK

[Captioner] 19:12:44
 FOR HOW MANY YOU HAVE YOU
DON'T CURRENTLY ENFORCE.


[Captioner] 19:12:47
THE CITY ORDINANCE CLEARLY CALLS OUT CALIFORNIA LAWS THAT ARE
ALREADY ON THE BOOKS

[Captioner] 19:12:50
 FOR ITEMS WHERE YOU CAN WRITE TICKETS.
I FEEL YOU

[Captioner] 19:12:53
 GUYS ARE GOING TO RUN INTO FIRST AMENDMENT ISSUES
WHERE

[Captioner] 19:12:57
 PEOPLE FILMING ARE GOING TO CLAIM THEY HAVE A FIRST
AMENDMENT RIGHT TO DO IT WHEN

[Captioner] 19:13:00
 YOU PASS SOMETHING LIKE THIS

[Captioner] 19:13:03
.
I THINK YOU SHOULD STICK WITH THE CURRENT CALIFORNIA LAWS AND NOT


[Captioner] 19:13:06
HAVE TO FIGHT YOUR OWN FIRST AMENDMENT BATTLES SINCE MOST OF

[Captioner] 19:13:09
 THIS
STUFF IS RECORDED AND THE BILL OF RIGHTS

[Captioner] 19:13:12
 GIVES EVERYONE THE FIRST
AMENDMENT RIGHT

[Captioner] 19:13:16
, THEREFORE, YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE CHALLENGES OF
FIRST

[Captioner] 19:13:19
 FIRST AMENDMENTS AGAINST THIS ORDINANCE

[Captioner] 19:13:22
 BECAUSE IT'S
NEWSWORTHY FOR SOMEONE TO GO OUT THERE

[Captioner] 19:13:25
 AND FILM, AND SO IF

[Captioner] 19:13:28
 YOU'RE
GOING TO TRY AND CREATE AN ORDINANCE FOR THAT, THAT IS PROBABLY


[Captioner] 19:13:31
HOW YOU'RE GOING TO GET TESTED, IS BY FIRST AMENDMENT PEOPLE, TO
SHOW

[Captioner] 19:13:34
 THAT IT'S ILLEGAL FOR YOU TO TAKE AWAY MY RIGHT TO

[Captioner] 19:13:37
 GO SEE
AND TO TELL OTHER PEOPLE

[Captioner] 19:13:40
 WHAT ARE HAPPENING.
THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:13:44
ARE THERE ANY -- I'M GOING TO CLOSE THE -- ARE THERE ANY

[Captioner] 19:13:46
 OTHER
SPEAKERS?
>> Ms. Gauthier: YES, WE HAVE JOHN 

[Captioner] 19:13:50
HINDS.
>> Mayor Mei: WELCOME, JOHN.


[Captioner] 19:13:53
>> HELLO, EVERYONE.
A LITTLE LONGER THIS TIME.


[Captioner] 19:13:56
WHEN WE DECIDE WHICH ACTIVITIES TO MAKE ILLEGAL

[Captioner] 19:13:59
, WE COULD BASE
THOSE DECISIONS ON HOW HARMFUL THE

[Captioner] 19:14:02
 ACTIVITIES ARE OR ON HOW

[Captioner] 19:14:06
 EASY
IT IS TO CATCH THE  OFFENDERS.
IT SEEMS THAT SOME OF THE LATTER

[Captioner] 19:14:09
 IS CREEPING IN IN THIS INSTANCE.


[Captioner] 19:14:12
FREMONT USED TO HAVE A BIG DRAG STRIP.
IT WAS PRIVATELY RUN ON

[Captioner] 19:14:16
 PRIVATE LAND AND SPECTATORS PAID TO GET
IN, WHICH

[Captioner] 19:14:19
 SHOWS THAT THEY WERE THERE BY CHOICE AND IMPLIES

[Captioner] 19:14:22
 THAT
THEY ACCEPTED THE RISKS OF STANDING AROUND NEAR FAST

[Captioner] 19:14:25
-MOVING
VEHICLES.
WHAT ARE THE

[Captioner] 19:14:28
 IMPORTANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THAT SORT OF LEGAL
RACING AND THE RACING

[Captioner] 19:14:32
 INSIDE SHOWS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TONIGHT?
FIRST THE ILLEGAL EVENTS

[Captioner] 19:14:35
 CREATE A DANGER TO INNOCENT BYSTANDERS
WHO ARE NOT THERE FOR THE

[Captioner] 19:14:38
 EVENT.
THERE'S ALSO A RISK TO NEAR

[Captioner] 19:14:42
BY CARS AND BUILDINGS.
NEXT, THE EVENTS MAY BE TRESPASSING

[Captioner] 19:14:45
 ON PRIVATE LAND OR MAY BE
BLOCKING THE PUBLIC RIGHT-OF-WAY

[Captioner] 19:14:48
 WITHOUT GETTING A PERMIT FIST,
THE WAY YOU'D HAVE TO FOR A PARADE

[Captioner] 19:14:52
 OR A FESTIVAL.
BUT OF THOSE REASON

[Captioner] 19:14:55
S, TO OUTLAW THESE EVENTS IN THE FIRST PLACE,
THAT DANGER

[Captioner] 19:14:58
 TO INNOCENT  BYSTANDERS IS THE MOST SERIOUS.


[Captioner] 19:15:02
YET SECTION 3 OF TONIGHT'S ORDINANCE EFFECTIVELY

[Captioner] 19:15:05
 SAYS THERE ARE
NO INNOCENT BYSTANDINGER

[Captioner] 19:15:08
S, AND EVERYONE WITHIN 200 FEET
IS A WILLING PARTICIPANT

[Captioner] 19:15:11
 LIKE THE

[Captioner] 19:15:15

SPECTATORS AT THE OLD DRAG  STRIP.
BUT THEN WHOM

[Captioner] 19:15:18
 ARE WE REALLY PROTECTING HERE?
THERE'S A LOGICAL FLAW IN THIS SOMEPLACE.


[Captioner] 19:15:21
IT SEEMS THAT WE LIKE TO TARGET THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE

[Captioner] 19:15:24
 THE MOST
ACTIVE ROLES, AIDING AND ABETTING IN

[Captioner] 19:15:27
 THESE EVENTS, LIKE THE ONES
WHO MAKE ADVANCED PREPARATIONS BLOCKING

[Captioner] 19:15:31
 OFF INTERSECTIONS.
BUT THEY'RE HARDER

[Captioner] 19:15:34
 TO CATCH BECAUSE THEY CAN JUST BLEND IN
THE CROWD, SO INSTEAD, WE OUT

[Captioner] 19:15:37
LAW SPECTATING AND JUST SCOOP UP
EVERYONE.


[Captioner] 19:15:40
IT'S EFFICIENT, BUT WE'RE CHOOSING WHICH

[Captioner] 19:15:44
 ROLES TO OUTLAW NOT
BASE

[Captioner] 19:15:47
ED ON THE HARM THEY DO BUT BASED ON WHO'S EASIER TO CATCH

[Captioner] 19:15:50
,
AND I THINK THAT'S NOT A VERY HEALTHY APPROACH

[Captioner] 19:15:53
 TO WRITING THE
LAWS WE ALL LIVE UNDER.
PLEASE

[Captioner] 19:15:56
 REMOVE SECTION 3 OR REWRITE

[Captioner] 19:16:00
 TO TARGET MORE ACTIVE ROLES
LIKE MAKING

[Captioner] 19:16:03
 ADVANCED PREPARATIONS, BLOCKING INTERSECTIONS, OR
FAIL

[Captioner] 19:16:06
ING TO DISPERSE WHEN POLICE ARRIVE WITH LIGHTS

[Captioner] 19:16:10
 AND SIRENS.
BECAUSE ANYBODY WHO FAILS TO MOVE

[Captioner] 19:16:13
 THEN IS ACTIVELY AIDING IN THE
EVENT.
THANK YOU

[Captioner] 19:16:16
.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:16:27
>> Ms. Gauthier: THAT'S THE LAST OF THE SPEAKERS.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:16:30
AT THIS TIME, I'LL CLOSE THE PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD.


[Captioner] 19:16:33
AND I'LL BRING IT BACK TO THE COUNCIL FOR CONVERSATION

[Captioner] 19:16:36
 OR
DISCUSSION.


[Captioner] 19:16:41
DOES ANY COUNCILMEMBER WISH TO ADDRESS THIS?
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN?


[Captioner] 19:16:44
I SEE YOUR HAND RAISED, BUT --

[Captioner] 19:16:45

>> Vice Mayor Salwan: THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR.


[Captioner] 19:16:48
I THINK THESE ARE ALL GOOD CONCERNS, BUT I THINK THE HEALTH AND

[Captioner] 19:16:50

SAFETY OF OUR COMMUNITY IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THAT WE


[Captioner] 19:16:54
SHOULD LOOK AT IN THIS

[Captioner] 19:16:56
 
ORDINANCE.
THIS HAS BECOME A MAJOR ISSUE


[Captioner] 19:16:59
FOR OUR RESIDENTS E PESHLY IN


[Captioner] 19:17:02
ARDENWOOD, WE HAD SEVERAL
INCIDENTS AS WELL AS OTHER PARTS
OF

[Captioner] 19:17:05
 FREMONT, THEY SHUT DOWN OUR
CITY, AND THEY CREATE

[Captioner] 19:17:09
 A SAFETY
HEALTH HAZARD.
SO

[Captioner] 19:17:12
 ALTHOUGH THERE'S NO PERFECT
ORDINANCES, I THINK THIS IS A
GOOD START.


[Captioner] 19:17:15
I THINK WE SHOULD USE IT.
SAN JOSÉ HAS BEEN DOING

[Captioner] 19:17:17
 THIS
WELL, AND IT'S A GOOD MODEL TO
FOLLOW.


[Captioner] 19:17:20
SO WITH THAT, I WILL BE
SUPPORTING THIS.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU

[Captioner] 19:17:24
.
NEXT IS COUNCILMEMBER COX.


[Captioner] 19:17:28
I'M NOT SURE IF THAT WAS FROM
BEFORE WHEN WE

[Captioner] 19:17:31
 WERE TESTING.
>> Councilmember Cox: I WOULD
LIKE TO ASK THE QUESTIONS TO OUR


[Captioner] 19:17:34
POLICE DEPARTMENT, IF THEY'RE
AVAILABLE BY PHONE?


[Captioner] 19:17:37
I HAD QUITE A FEW QUESTIONS.


[Captioner] 19:17:42
>> Ms. Gauthier: LIEUTENANT IS
ON ZOOM.
>> Councilmember Cox: OH, THERE


[Captioner] 19:17:44
HE IS.
OKAY.
>> Mayor Mei: HELLO.


[Captioner] 19:17:48
>> Councilmember Cox: GOOD
EVENING.
>> GOOD EVENING, MA'AM.


[Captioner] 19:17:51
>> Councilmember Cox: I HAD A
COUPLE OF QUESTIONS REGARDING
THIS ORDINANCE

[Captioner] 19:17:54
.
COULD YOU PROVIDE SOME
BACKGROUND

[Captioner] 19:17:58
 INFORMATION IN TERMS
OF THE NUMBER OF

[Captioner] 19:18:02
 SIDESHOWS THAT
HAVE OCCURRED IN FREMONT OVER
THE LAST

[Captioner] 19:18:05
 YEAR?
AND IN TERMS OF HAVE YOU BEEN
ABLE TO

[Captioner] 19:18:09
 CATCH PEOPLE THAT HAVE
PERFORMED IT, YOU KNOW

[Captioner] 19:18:12
, KIND OF
GIVE A LITTLE BIT MORE
BACKGROUND SO I CAN UNDERSTAND

[Captioner] 19:18:16

HOW IMPACT THIS ORDINANCE WOULD


[Captioner] 19:18:19
BE.
>> YES, MA'AM.
I DON'T HAVE THE

[Captioner] 19:18:22
 EXACT NUMBER OF
SIDESHOWS ON HAND.


[Captioner] 19:18:25
HOWEVER, WE'VE

[Captioner] 19:18:29
 HAD ENOUGH TO
CAUSE TREMENDOUS

[Captioner] 19:18:32
 CONCERN
THROUGHOUT THE COMMUNITY

[Captioner] 19:18:36
.
SO MUCH SO THAT DURING NATIONAL
NIGHT OUT, YOU KNOW

[Captioner] 19:18:39
, MYSELF AND
MY COLLEAGUES, I THINK A LOT

[Captioner] 19:18:42
 OF
THE CONVERSATION TOPICS CAME UP
AROUND

[Captioner] 19:18:45
 SIDESHOW ACTIVITY.
WE

[Captioner] 19:18:49
 RECOGNIZE THE DANGER THAT
SIDE SHOWS POSE

[Captioner] 19:18:52
 TO COMMUNITY
MEMBERS.


[Captioner] 19:18:55
ANOTHER PERSON WHO'S ON THE CALL
TONIGHT,

[Captioner] 19:18:59
 SERGEANT DARRELL 
VANREEK,

[Captioner] 19:19:02
 HE'S AN EXPERT IN 
SIDESHOWS, AND HE

[Captioner] 19:19:08
 HAS LED
TRAINING IN OUR DEPARTMENT,
SPECIFICALLY GEARED

[Captioner] 19:19:11
 TOWARDS
IDENTIFYING OFFENDERS, AND
FOLLOWING UP

[Captioner] 19:19:15
 WITH THOSE 
OFFENDERS

[Captioner] 19:19:18
 VIA THEIR LICENSE
PLATES AND THEN GOING AFTER THEM

[Captioner] 19:19:21

ESSENTIALLY USING THE VEHICLE

[Captioner] 19:19:26
 --
TO IMPOUND THEIR VEHICLES.
SO WE'VE ESSENTIALLY, DUE

[Captioner] 19:19:29
 TO OUR
LACK OF RESOURCES AND

[Captioner] 19:19:33
 FRANKLY
BEING OVERRUN AT THESE SIDESHOWS

[Captioner] 19:19:36

SIDESHOWS, ESPECIALLY HOW
DANGEROUS THEY ARE TO ALL OF OUR

[Captioner] 19:19:39

PUBLIC SAFETY PARTNERS, YOU 
KNOW, DOING THE

[Captioner] 19:19:43
 BEST WE CAN TO
GATHER AS MUCH INTELLIGENCE

[Captioner] 19:19:45
 AND
THEN FOLLOW UP WITH THOSE 
OFFENDERS.


[Captioner] 19:19:48
BUT I CAN FOLLOW UP, SERGEANT

[Captioner] 19:19:51

VANREEK, IF YOU'RE ON THE CALL
NOW, IF YOU

[Captioner] 19:19:54
 HAVE MORE DATA TO
SHARE OR SPECIFICS TOWARDS THE
COUNCILMEMBER

[Captioner] 19:19:58
'S QUESTION.


[Captioner] 19:20:05
>> YES, SIR, I AM ON THE CALL.
I DO NOT HAVE

[Captioner] 19:20:08
 THE SPECIFIC
NUMBERS.
WE HAVE SEEN A REDUCTION FROM


[Captioner] 19:20:13
2020 TO 2021.
BASED. OFF OF

[Captioner] 19:20:16
 OUR ENFORCEMENT
EFFORTS BUT I DON'T HAVE THE
SPECIFIC NUMBERS

[Captioner] 19:20:19
 AT THIS TIME.


[Captioner] 19:20:23
>> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.
IS THERE A REASON WHY IT'S MORE
IN NORTH

[Captioner] 19:20:26
 FREMONT VERSUS SOUTH
FREMONT?
WHAT'S KIND OF THE

[Captioner] 19:20:29
 BACKGROUND OF
CHOOSING ARDENWOOD

[Captioner] 19:20:32
 AREA VERSUS
IRVINGTON OR MISSION

[Captioner] 19:20:36
 SAN JOSÉ?
IS THERE SOME PARTICULAR REASON

[Captioner] 19:20:39
?
>> MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IT'S

[Captioner] 19:20:42

JUST THE EASE OF ACCESS TO LARGE
STRETCHES

[Captioner] 19:20:46
 OF ROADWAYS AND WIDE
INTERSECTIONS

[Captioner] 19:20:49
 CLOSE TO FREEWAY
OFF-RAMPS.
THAT'S

[Captioner] 19:20:52
 ESSENTIALLY, YOU KNOW,
HOW

[Captioner] 19:20:55
 MOST OF THESE

[Captioner] 19:20:59
 SIDESHOWS GET
STARTED, IS CLOSE ACCESS

[Captioner] 19:21:03
 TO
LARGE INTERSECTIONS AND ALSO,
YOU KNOW,

[Captioner] 19:21:06
 EASY ACCESS TO GET ON
AND OFF FREEWAYS.


[Captioner] 19:21:10
>> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.
IF THIS PASSES TONIGHT

[Captioner] 19:21:13
, COULD
YOU GIVE

[Captioner] 19:21:16
 ME AN IDEA OF WHAT
WOULD BE THE PLAN IN TERMS OF
THE LAW

[Captioner] 19:21:19
 ENFORCEMENT

[Captioner] 19:21:22
 AND
INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT THE
SIDESHOW ORDINANCES

[Captioner] 19:21:26
?
>> YES, MA'AM.
ESSENTIALLY

[Captioner] 19:21:29
 WE WOULD TRAIN ALL
OF OUR

[Captioner] 19:21:32
 POLICE OFFICERS TO HAVE
THIS

[Captioner] 19:21:37
 ORDINANCE AS JUST PART OF
OUR TOOL BELT, I WOULD SAY.
SOMETHING ELSE THAT WE

[Captioner] 19:21:41
 CAN
ADDRESS THESE

[Captioner] 19:21:48
 SPECTATORS WHO --
AND ALSO PROMOTERS

[Captioner] 19:21:52
 WHO HELP
PROMOTE THESE SHOWS PROVIDE
TRAINING TO ALL OF

[Captioner] 19:21:55
 OUR POLICE
OFFICERS, AND REALISTICALLY,

[Captioner] 19:22:00

MR. HINDS HAD TALKED BRIEFLY
ABOUT PROVIDING SOME

[Captioner] 19:22:03
 KIND OF A
WARNING TO ANY BY

[Captioner] 19:22:06
STANDERS.
BUT I CAN TELL YOU WITH FULL

[Captioner] 19:22:10

CONFIDENCE RIGHT NOW, WHEN WE
SHOW UP TO THESE

[Captioner] 19:22:13
 SIDESHOWS,
LIGHTS AND SIRENS ARE ON.
WE ARE MAKING

[Captioner] 19:22:16
 EVERY ATTEMPT FOR
PEOPLE TO HAVE SAFE

[Captioner] 19:22:19
 PASSAGE TO
LEAVE THE AREA,

[Captioner] 19:22:22
 YOU KNOW, SO
THIS WOULD REALLY

[Captioner] 19:22:26
 BENEFIT
OFFICERS TO

[Captioner] 19:22:29
 IDENTIFY THOSE
PEOPLE WHO PROMOTE THESE
DANGEROUS

[Captioner] 19:22:32
 ACTIVITIES, AND

[Captioner] 19:22:35
 ALSO
WHO ARE JUST CARELESS IN THEIR
PARTICIPATION OF

[Captioner] 19:22:38
 THIS

[Captioner] 19:22:41
 -- THESE
SIDE SHOW EVENTS.
SO I WOULD SAY ESSENTIALLY WE


[Captioner] 19:22:49
WOULD PROVIDE TRAINING, WE WOULD
MAKE SURE THAT EVERY OPPORTUNITY
FOR PEOPLE TO LEAVE THE AREA


[Captioner] 19:22:55
WOULD BE PROVIDED WHILE AT THE
SAME TIME GATHERING AS MUCH
INTELLIGENCE AS WE COULD TO


[Captioner] 19:22:59
FOLLOW UP WITH THESE OFFENDERS
AT A LATER DATE.
AS YOU HAD MENTIONED EARLIER IN


[Captioner] 19:23:06
YOUR QUESTION.
AND THEN REALLY JUST HAVE THIS
AS A METHOD TO CITE THESE FOLKS


[Captioner] 19:23:14
THAT ARE STILL IN THE AREA, AND
CAUSING A NUISANCE.
>> Councilmember Cox: I WOULD


[Captioner] 19:23:18
LIKE TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND 
WHEN -- HOW MANY ARRESTS HAVE
BEEN DONE?


[Captioner] 19:23:24
I'M JUST TRYING TO ADD, WHAT IS
SOME OF THE BACKGROUND DATA?
BECAUSE I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHY


[Captioner] 19:23:33
WE'RE DOING IF IT'S BECOME SUCH
A BIG PROBLEM AND WHY I DON'T
HAVE NUMBERS GIVEN AND


[Captioner] 19:23:39
QUANTITATIVELY FOR THIS.
I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND
HOW BIG A PROBLEM IT IS.


[Captioner] 19:23:47
YES, I DO WANT TO SUPPORT THE
SAFETY OF OUR FREMONT RESIDENTS,
BUT I WOULD THINK THAT COMING


[Captioner] 19:23:52
FROM THE FREMONT POLICE SIDE,
THAT I WOULD HAVE SOME DATA.
YOU TRACK ALL THE OTHER CRIMES


[Captioner] 19:24:01
AND THINGS LIKE THAT.
I WOULD LIKE TO UNDERSTAND HOW
ANY SIDE SHOWS, HAS ANYBODY BEEN


[Captioner] 19:24:09
INJURED, HAS ANYONE BEEN KILLED,
HAS THERE BEEN IMPACT ON HURTING
OUR FREMONT POLICE?


[Captioner] 19:24:15
THESE ARE SOME OF THE ANSWERS
I'M TRYING TO ASSESS AND OBTAIN
TONIGHT IN ORDER TO MAKE A


[Captioner] 19:24:19
DECISION ABOUT THIS NEW
ORDINANCE.
>> COUNCILMEMBER COX, GOOD


[Captioner] 19:24:24
EVENING, EVERYONE.
IT'S CHIEF WASHINGTON HERE.
CAN YOU GUYS HEAR ME OKAY?


[Captioner] 19:24:31
>> YES.
>> Mayor Mei: YES, WE CAN HEAR
YOU.


[Captioner] 19:24:36
>> THANK YOU.
THANKS FOR -- I'M SORRY TO
INTERRUPT THE DISCUSSION, BUT I


[Captioner] 19:24:43
DO HAVE SOME OF THAT INFORMATION
THAT YOU WERE INQUIRING ABOUT.
YOU KNOW, HAVING STUDIED THIS


[Captioner] 19:24:49
PARTICULAR ISSUE OVER THE LAST
COUPLE OF YEARS, I CAN SHARE
SOME OF THAT DATA WITH YOU THAT


[Captioner] 19:24:56
YOU REQUESTED.
SO THE REASON WHY WE HAVE BEEN
SO PASSIONATE ABOUT ENACTING


[Captioner] 19:25:01
SOMETHING TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE
IS, NUMBER ONE, FEEDBACK THAT
WE'VE RECEIVED FROM OUR


[Captioner] 19:25:09
COMMUNITY THAT HAS GROWING
CONCERNS ABOUT THE DANGERS
ASSOCIATED WITH THESE 


[Captioner] 19:25:14
ACTIVITIES.
SO IN 2019, WE HAD 122 OF THESE
INCIDENTS.


[Captioner] 19:25:21
AND THEN WE HAD A SPIKE IN 2020.
THAT WENT UP TO 175.
AND SO AS A RESULT, IN 2020, WE


[Captioner] 19:25:29
STARTED TO WORK WITH OUR PARTNER
AGENCIES, AND WE WERE ABLE TO
SEE A REDUCTION TO 115 OF THESE


[Captioner] 19:25:37
INCIDENTS IN A CALENDAR YEAR.
NOW IT'S IMPORTANT TO 
UNDERSTAND, 115, THAT'S STILL


[Captioner] 19:25:46
QUITE A LOT.
AND SO AS A RESULT OF THOSE
NUMBERS, WE FELT LIKE WE WANTED


[Captioner] 19:25:54
TO CONTINUE THAT DOWNWARD TREND
WITH ENACTING AN ORDINANCE THAT
DETERRED AND ALLOWED US SOME


[Captioner] 19:26:00
ENFORCEMENT TOOLS TO HELP
MITIGATE THESE DANGERS EVEN
FURTHER.


[Captioner] 19:26:09
SO ANYWAY, THAT'S SOME OF THE
DATA THAT WE HAD THAT REALLY
MOTIVATED US ALONG WITH THE


[Captioner] 19:26:14
COMMUNITY CONCERNS TO GO DOWN
THIS PATH AND FOLLOW THE LEAD OF
CITIES LIKE SAN JOSÉ TO TRY TO


[Captioner] 19:26:19
DO ALL WE CAN TO PROTECT THIS
COMMUNITY KNOWING HOW IMPACTFUL
THIS TYPE OF ACTIVITY IS.


[Captioner] 19:26:27
>> Councilmember Cox: AND IT'S
UNDERSTOOD SINCE WE'RE NOT FAR
FROM SAN JOSÉ, IT'S EASY ON THE


[Captioner] 19:26:35
FREEWAY THERE.
COULD YOU HELP ME UNDERSTAND A
LITTLE BIT MORE IN TERMS OF --


[Captioner] 19:26:42
CALIFORNIA WE HAVE OUR VEHICLE
CODE THAT ADDRESSES RECKLESS
DRIVING AND ANY DRIVING THAT IS


[Captioner] 19:26:49
NOT WITHIN THE LAW, AND I'M 
TRYING TO UNDERSTAND HOW THIS
PARTICULAR ORDINANCE IS GOING TO


[Captioner] 19:26:56
BE DIFFERENT THAN WHAT'S ALREADY
BEEN ON THE BOOKS, AND I KNOW
THAT ONE OF THE SPEAKERS HAD


[Captioner] 19:27:02
SPOKEN TO THAT EFFECT.
AND I'M JUST TRYING TO
UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCE OF WHY


[Captioner] 19:27:07
THIS ONE.
I SEE SOME OF THE STREETS THAT
ARE ADDRESSED ARE MORE ON THE


[Captioner] 19:27:14
ARDENWOOD AREA, NORTH FREMONT,
BUT AT THE SAME TIME, I'M JUST
TRYING TO UNDERSTAND, IS THERE A


[Captioner] 19:27:20
DUPLICATION AND TRYING TO
UNDERSTAND WHY WE'RE NOT
STICKING TO THE CALIFORNIA CODE


[Captioner] 19:27:25
FOR VEHICLES VERSUS THE SPECIFIC
ONE HERE FOR THE ORDINANCE FOR
THE CITY OF FREMONT.


[Captioner] 19:27:35
>> CAPTAIN HARTNETT OR SERGEANT,
DO YOU WANT TO TAKE THAT ONE?
OTHERWISE I CAN STEP IN.


[Captioner] 19:27:41
>> YEAH.
ESSENTIALLY THIS ADDS THE
PROHIBITING OF THE SPECTATORS,


[Captioner] 19:27:47
MA'AM, AND ALSO THE PROMOTERS.
SO THE VEHICLE CODE DOESN'T
ADDRESS THOSE TWO THINGS.


[Captioner] 19:27:59
SO THIS ORDINANCE SPECIFICALLY
WILL HELP MITIGATE THE
ENCOURAGEMENT OF THESE SIDESHOWS


[Captioner] 19:28:05
WITH THE SPECTATORS AND THE
PROMOTERS.
>> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.


[Captioner] 19:28:08
SO THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE THAT'S
NOT ADDRESSED IN THE CALIFORNIA
CODE.


[Captioner] 19:28:12
>> YES, MA'AM.
>> Councilmember Cox: THANK YOU
VERY MUCH.


[Captioner] 19:28:15
I APPRECIATE YOUR INPUT FROM ALL
OF YOU.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:28:24
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
NEXT IS COUNCILMEMBER SHAO.
I'M GOING DOWN THE LIST.


[Captioner] 19:28:27
SORRY, I THINK THAT'S --
>> Councilmember Shao: THANK
YOU, MADAME MAYOR.


[Captioner] 19:28:35
I WELCOME THIS TIMELY ORDINANCE.
FIRST, IT IS IN COMPLIANCE WITH
THE ONGOING CALIFORNIA LAW.


[Captioner] 19:28:45
SECONDLY, WE HAVE ALREADY SEEN
THAT FREMONT HAS FALLEN VICTIM
TO MULTIPLE SUCH EVENTS IN THE


[Captioner] 19:28:53
PAST, AND THIS IS GOING TO BE A
CORRECTIVE ACTION AND ALSO A
PREVENTIVE ACTION SO THAT WE CAN


[Captioner] 19:29:05
PROVIDE THE POLICE OFFICERS WITH
MORE POWER OR TOOTH OR TEETH TO
FIGHT AGAINST THIS NOT ONLY


[Captioner] 19:29:11
NUISANCE, BUT ALSO POTENTIAL
HAZARD TO PUBLIC TRAFFIC AND
SAFETY.


[Captioner] 19:29:23
I BELIEVE IT IS EQUALLY
IMPORTANT TO TARGET THOSE
PROMOTERS AND SPECTATORS LIKE IN


[Captioner] 19:29:28
A WAR AGAINST DRUGS.
WE NOT ONLY TARGET THE DRUG
DEALERS, BUT ALSO THE DRUG 


[Captioner] 19:29:36
USERS.
IT IS THE SAME STRATEGY.
WITHOUT SPECTATORS, CERTAINLY IT


[Captioner] 19:29:47
WILL BE NOT AS ENCOURAGING FOR
THOSE WHO WANT TO ENGAGE IN 
SIDESHOWS AND ILLEGAL CAR RACING


[Captioner] 19:29:57
ON THE PUBLIC ROADS.
SO ONCE AGAIN, I AM SUPPORTIVE
TO THIS ORDINANCE, AND THIS ALSO


[Captioner] 19:30:05
SPREADS A MESSAGE TO EVERYONE IN
THE BAY AREA THAT FREMONT HAS NO
TOLERANCE FOR SUCH ILLEGAL


[Captioner] 19:30:12
ACTIVITIES.
THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU,


[Captioner] 19:30:16
COUNCILMEMBER SHAO.
NEXT IS COUNCILMEMBER KENG.
>> Councilmember Keng: THANK


[Captioner] 19:30:23
YOU, MADAME MAYOR.
SO I WELCOME THIS ORDINANCE THAT
IS GOING TO FOCUS ON THE STREET


[Captioner] 19:30:29
RACING AND SIDESHOW EVENTS THAT
HAS BEEN HAPPENING VERY OFTEN
SINCE 2020.


[Captioner] 19:30:38
SO IN ARDENWOOD IN 
DISTRICT 1 PARTICULARLY, WE HAVE
HAD MANY OF THESE SIDESHOWS


[Captioner] 19:30:48
SINCE 2020, WHERE SOME OF THESE
EVENT HAD UP TO 200 CARS OR MORE
IN PUBLIC STREETS, PERHAPS ON A


[Captioner] 19:30:57
FRIDAY OR SATURDAY NIGHT, FOR
HOURS AT A TIME, AND PEOPLE 
LIVING IN THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS,


[Captioner] 19:31:06
WITH THESE AFFECTED STREETS,
COULDN'T EVEN GET HOME AFTER
WORK OR GO OUT FOR GROCERY


[Captioner] 19:31:08
SHOPPING.
SO THAT'S HOW BAD IT WAS 
GETTING.


[Captioner] 19:31:20
AND THERE WERE PROBABLY MORE
THAN ONE TIME WHERE PEOPLE TRIED
TO FILM, YOU KNOW, TRY TO FILM


[Captioner] 19:31:28
THESE CARS IN TIGHT FOOTAGE TO
SEND TO THE POLICE, AND THERE
WERE PEOPLE THAT WERE ROBBED OF


[Captioner] 19:31:33
THEIR PHONES BY GUNS.
SO WE DEFINITELY WANT TO KEEP
OUR RESIDENTS' SAFETY AS OUR TOP


[Captioner] 19:31:41
PRIORITY, AND MAKE SURE THAT WE
CAN KEEP THESE EVENT AWAY FROM
FREMONT.


[Captioner] 19:31:50
SO IN DISTRICT 1, WE ACTUALLY
HAVE HELD MULTIPLE COMMUNITY
MEETINGS WITH THE POLICE


[Captioner] 19:32:02
DEPARTMENT, HOW WE CAN MITIGATE
THESE EVENT, AND I KNOW OUR
FORMER POLICE CHIEF AND CHIEF


[Captioner] 19:32:09
WASHINGTON, CAPTAIN HARTNETT,
SERGEANT MANRIQUE, ALL OF THEM
HAVE BEEN IN MULTIPLE MEETINGS


[Captioner] 19:32:17
WITH US, AND WE HAD SHOWN THAT
THESE EVENTS HAD GONE DOWN.
HOWEVER, WHEN WE HAVE MORE THAN


[Captioner] 19:32:23
100 CARS OR 200 CARS SHOW UP,
YOU KNOW, AT ONE OF THESE
EVENTS, WE DON'T HAVE THE 


[Captioner] 19:32:27
MANPOWER TO GO OUT AND WE DON'T
WANT TO PUT OUR OFFICERS IN
DANGER AS WELL.


[Captioner] 19:32:37
SO I THINK THIS IS VERY TIMELY
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DETER THESE
CAR RACERS FROM COMING INTO OUR


[Captioner] 19:32:41
TOWN, OUR CITY, AND WE CAN KEEP
OUR RESIDENTS SAFE.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:32:49
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
NEXT IS COUNCILMEMBER JONES, WHO
MIGHT HAVE SOME GREAT INSIGHT ON


[Captioner] 19:32:55
THIS.
>> Councilmember Jones: THANK
YOU, MADAME MAYOR.


[Captioner] 19:32:59
I WAS GOING TO BRING UP THE
POINT THAT THIS IS REALLY
NOTHING NEW IN FREMONT.


[Captioner] 19:33:03
YOU KNOW, MR. HINDS MENTIONED
THAT WE USED TO HAVE A DRAG
STRIP HERE IN FREMONT.


[Captioner] 19:33:10
WE DID.
IT WAS LEGAL FOR PEOPLE TO GO
DOWN AND THEY WOULD DO RACE,


[Captioner] 19:33:16
SPONSORED EVENT, THOSE KINDS OF
THINGS, BUT ON BOSCELL ROAD, WE
ALSO HAD LITTLE FREMONT.


[Captioner] 19:33:20
AND INCLUDING A START AND A
FINISH LINE PAINTED RIGHT ON THE
ROADWAY.


[Captioner] 19:33:26
AND THE PROBLEM WITH THAT WAS,
THE PEOPLE WHO WERE RACING,
NUMBER ONE, ARE INEXPERIENCED,


[Captioner] 19:33:29
THEY'RE NOT SUPERVISED, BUT THE
BIGGER PROBLEM WAS THE 
SPECTATORS.


[Captioner] 19:33:34
AND YOU KNOW, I CAN RECALL
RESPONDING TO ONE PARTICULAR
INCIDENT WHERE A YOUNG LADY


[Captioner] 19:33:40
DECIDED SHE WANTED TO CROSS THE
ROAD TO VISIT WITH SOME FRIENDS
ACROSS THE STREET.


[Captioner] 19:33:45
AND YOU REALLY HAD NO SENSE OF
JUDGMENT OF HOW FAST A CAR IS
GOING WHEN IT'S APPROACHING YOU


[Captioner] 19:33:49
AT 90 TO 100 MILES AN HOUR.
AND UNFORTUNATELY, SHE WAS
STRUCK AND KILLED.


[Captioner] 19:33:56
SO THERE ARE A NUMBER OF
POTENTIAL OUTCOMES TO THESE
TYPES OF ACTIVITIES.


[Captioner] 19:34:02
SAN JOSÉ HAS SEEN SHOTS FIRED,
OAKLAND HAS SEEN SHOTS FIRED.
YOU KNOW, AS VICE MAYOR KENG


[Captioner] 19:34:08
JUST REPORTED, THERE HAVE BEEN
RESIDENT WHO HAVE BEEN GOING OUT
TO FILM TO FORWARD THAT


[Captioner] 19:34:11
INFORMATION TO THE POLICE
DEPARTMENT.
THEY HAVE BEEN ROBBED OF THEIR


[Captioner] 19:34:15
CELL PHONES, SOMETIMES AT
GUNPOINT, SOMETIMES JUST BY
PHYSICAL FORCE.


[Captioner] 19:34:21
SO THERE'S A LOT OF ACTIVITY
THAT THE SPECTATORS ARE
PARTICIPATING IN THAT IS JUST


[Captioner] 19:34:26
KIND OF FUELING THE FIRE, SO TO
SPEAK.
SO THE BIGGEST PART OF THIS,


[Captioner] 19:34:31
AGAIN, THIS IS NOT COVERED IN
THE CALIFORNIA VEHICLE CODE.
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF SECTIONS


[Captioner] 19:34:36
THAT ARE.
THERE'S RECKLESS DRIVING,
EXHIBITION AND SPEED, SPEED


[Captioner] 19:34:40
CONTESTS, THOSE KINDS OF THINGS,
BUT NOTHING COVERS SPECTATORS IN
THOSE EVENT.


[Captioner] 19:34:45
SO THIS IS GOING TO BE A GREAT
TOOL FOR OUR DEPARTMENT AND OUR
OFFICERS TO GO OUT AND RESPOND


[Captioner] 19:34:49
TO THESE EVENT, AND START
SHUTTING THINGS DOWN.
BECAUSE WITH NO SPECTATORS, YOU


[Captioner] 19:34:55
HAVE NO EVENT.
SO I WOULD BE FULLY SUPPORTIVE
OF MOVING THIS ORDINANCE 


[Captioner] 19:34:59
FORWARD.
THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:35:02
DID COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN JOIN 
US?
I WANTED TO MAKE SURE.


[Captioner] 19:35:07
OKAY.
THANK YOU.
WELL, SINCE SHE'S NOT THERE, I


[Captioner] 19:35:15
WILL MAKE SOME COMMENTS TOO.
SO I KNOW THAT THIS IS SOMETHING
THAT HAS BEEN REQUESTED, AND I


[Captioner] 19:35:20
APPRECIATE THAT COUNCILMEMBER
KENG HAS EXPRESSED THIS AND
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN HAS


[Captioner] 19:35:24
EXPRESSED THIS, BECAUSE I'VE
LOOKED M AT SOME OF THOSE
LOCATIONS AND CERTAINLY SOME ARE


[Captioner] 19:35:31
IN THE SOUTHERN END, OFF OF
AUTOMALL IN PARTICULAR.
I AM FAMILIAR AND I KNOW SOME


[Captioner] 19:35:39
PEOPLE HAVE WROTE TO ME ABOUT
THE PREVIOUS DRAG STRIP, BUT
THAT WAS, I THINK, SHUTTERED IN


[Captioner] 19:35:42
1980 SOMETHING, IF I REMEMBER
CORRECTLY?
>> Councilmember Jones: THE LATE


[Captioner] 19:35:46
80s, EARLY 90s.
>> Mayor Mei: BEFORE MY ARRIVAL
EVEN INTO THE CITY OF FREMONT,


[Captioner] 19:35:49
BECAUSE I WAS LIVING IN
PHILADELPHIA AT THAT TIME.
BUT I REMEMBER IT'S BEEN 


[Captioner] 19:35:55
SHUTTERED FOR SOME TIME.
AND FROM WHAT WE CAN SEE, BASED
OFF OF THE INCREASING TREND THAT


[Captioner] 19:36:02
WE SAW, ESPECIALLY OF GREAT
CONCERN IN 2020, WAS THAT WHEN
PEOPLE WERE TRYING TO DETER IT,


[Captioner] 19:36:08
WHETHER IT'S THROUGH OUR
OFFICERS OR SOMETIMES THE
NEIGHBORHOOD SPECTATORS, THERE


[Captioner] 19:36:16
WAS SEVERAL INCIDENTS WHERE I
KNOW THAT UNFORTUNATELY IT WAS
CONFRONTATIONAL, AND PEOPLE WERE


[Captioner] 19:36:23
PHYSICALLY INJURED OR PHYSICALLY
THREATENED.
SO, THEREFORE, I KNOW THAT THIS


[Captioner] 19:36:30
IS SOMETHING STAFF -- I DON'T
KNOW IF ANYBODY WANTS TO COMMENT
ON IT BUT I THINK IT'S IN OUR


[Captioner] 19:36:35
BEST INTEREST IN HEARING AND
ANALYZING WHAT WE'VE SEEN FROM
COMPARATIVE AGENCIES, SUCH AS IN


[Captioner] 19:36:43
SAN JOSÉ, AS A DETERRENCE, AND
WE'VE BEEN PART OF ALSO AND I
ALSO WANT TO THANK OUR OFFICERS


[Captioner] 19:36:55
FOR WORKING WITH COLLECTIVE
NEIGHBORING  AGENCIES.
WHEN WE ARE AWARE ONE OF THESE


[Captioner] 19:36:58
EVENTS ARE COMING, WE SHARE THAT
INFORMATION THROUGHOUT OUR
NEIGHBORING BAY AREA SO THAT


[Captioner] 19:37:02
HELPS US DETER IT.
SO THAT'S PART OF WHY WE CAME UP
WITH THIS PROPOSAL.


[Captioner] 19:37:09
I ALSO WANTED TO CLARIFY ALSO
AND PERHAPS OFFICER HARTNETT OR
ANY OF THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE


[Captioner] 19:37:15
TEAM WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS, THAT
WE ARE NOT LOOKING TO ADDRESS
THE MOM WHO WAS DRIVING BY OR


[Captioner] 19:37:20
COMING HOME FROM SOCCER OR
SOMETHING LIKE THIS.
WE ARE FOCUSING SPECIFICALLY ON


[Captioner] 19:37:26
MORE THE PROMOTERS AND THE
SPECTATORS AND I HAD ASKED THIS
QUESTION EARLIER TODAY, BUT I


[Captioner] 19:37:32
DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT TO
ADDRESS THAT, CHIEF WASHINGTON,
HOW WOULD WE PROPOSE DOING THAT


[Captioner] 19:37:36
IN TERMS OF THE TEAM AND AS WELL
AS THE SCREENING, SO IT'S NOT
LIKE WE'RE GOING TO CATCH THE


[Captioner] 19:37:41
EMPLOYEE LEAVING THE OFFICE OR
WATCHING IT FROM THEIR WINDOW,
WHICH I DON'T THINK MANY OF


[Captioner] 19:37:45
THESE -- THESE ARE USUALLY EVENT
THAT OCCUR LATER IN THE EVENING,
FROM WHAT I'VE SEEN IN THE PAST.


[Captioner] 19:37:50
SO WOULD ANYONE LIKE TO ADDRESS
THIS?
I SEE CHIEF WASHINGTON.


[Captioner] 19:37:53
THANK YOU.
>> YES.
THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR.


[Captioner] 19:38:00
SO IN MY EXPERIENCE, THE
SCENARIO THAT YOU JUST 
DESCRIBED, I GUESS THERE IS A


[Captioner] 19:38:04
REMOTE POSSIBILITY THAT THAT
COULD HAPPEN, BUT I'VE NEVER
SEEN IT.


[Captioner] 19:38:10
SO THE INDIVIDUALS THAT
PARTICIPATE IN THIS ILLEGAL AND
DANGEROUS ACTIVITY, THEY ARE


[Captioner] 19:38:17
THERE FOR THAT SPECIFIC PURPOSE.
SO THAT'S WHY OUR OFFICERS HAVE
DISCRETION.


[Captioner] 19:38:23
SO WE WILL BE ABLE TO CLEARLY
DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THOSE WHO
MAY HAVE INNOCENTLY BEEN DRIVING


[Captioner] 19:38:29
BY OR THOSE WHO WERE THERE TO
PROMOTE AND ENCOURAGE THIS TYPE
OF DANGEROUS BEHAVIOR.


[Captioner] 19:38:35
SO I'M CONFIDENT THAT ALTHOUGH I
GUESS THERE IS A REMOTE
POSSIBILITY, I'VE JUST NEVER


[Captioner] 19:38:47
SEEN IT OCCUR, OUR MATERIALIZE.
AND SO NORMALLY THE MAJORITY OF
OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS, THEY WANT


[Captioner] 19:38:54
TO BE AS FAR AWAY FROM THIS TYPE
OF ACTIVITY AS POSSIBLE, BECAUSE
A LOT OF TIMES, THERE'S GUNFIRE,


[Captioner] 19:38:58
THERE'S DANGEROUS DRIVING AND
THOSE TYPE OF THINGS.
SO WE HAVE DISCRETION AS POLICE


[Captioner] 19:39:06
OFFICERS AND WE DEFINITELY WILL
ASSESS A SITUATION AND CLEARLY
TRY TO DETERMINE WHO IS


[Captioner] 19:39:15
PROMOTING AND ENCOURAGING THIS
TYPE OF BEHAVIOR VERSUS SOMEONE
WHO JUST HAPPENED TO COME UPON


[Captioner] 19:39:22
THE SITUATION.
AND ALSO THERE'S VARIOUS METHODS
TO ADDRESS THIS PARTICULAR 


[Captioner] 19:39:29
ISSUE, AND IT'S NOT LIKE -- SO
IF WE HAVE 200 CARS THAT'S
PARTICIPATING IN THIS ACTIVITY,


[Captioner] 19:39:36
IT'S LIKELY WE WILL NOT BE ABLE
TO RESPOND OR FOLLOW UP OR
DETAIN EACH OF THOSE 


[Captioner] 19:39:40
INDIVIDUALS.
SO THERE'S GOING TO BE QUITE A
FEW FOLKS THAT ARE NOT GOING TO


[Captioner] 19:39:48
BE SWEPT UP IN ANY TYPE OF
ENFORCEMENT ACTION, BUT EVEN
THOSE WHO ARE, WE STILL HAVE TO


[Captioner] 19:39:56
ESTABLISH PROBABLE CAUSE AND
REASONABLE SUSPICION THAT A
CRIME IS OCCURRING BEFORE WE


[Captioner] 19:40:01
TAKE ANY ACTION.
SO I HAVE ALL THE CONFIDENCE IN
THE WORLD THAT MY OFFICERS WILL


[Captioner] 19:40:07
DO JUST THAT, AND TO PREVENT
THIS TYPE OF SCENARIO FROM 
OCCURRING.


[Captioner] 19:40:14
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
>> THROUGH THE MAYOR, IF I MAY.
>> Mayor Mei: YES, PLEASE, OUR


[Captioner] 19:40:17
CITY ATTORNEY.
>> THANK YOU, MAYOR.
JUST TO ADD TO THE CHIEF'S


[Captioner] 19:40:23
PRESENTATION THERE, THE LANGUAGE
OF THE ORDINANCE REQUIRES THE
SPECTATOR TO BE THERE KNOWINGLY,


[Captioner] 19:40:26
MEANING YOU HAVE TO KNOW THAT
IT'S A STREET SHOW AND
ESSENTIALLY HAVE A DESIRE TO BE


[Captioner] 19:40:30
THERE, IN ADDITION TO THE FACT
THAT YOU HAVE TO BE WITHIN A
CERTAIN FEET DISTANCE, 200 FEET,


[Captioner] 19:40:35
AS A REQUIREMENT AS WELL TO BE
CAPTURED WITHIN THE REGULATORY
PROVISIONS OF THIS NEW 


[Captioner] 19:40:39
ORDINANCE.
SO THERE IS LANGUAGE IN THERE
THAT IS INTENDED TO ADDRESS THAT


[Captioner] 19:40:45
SCENARIO, MAKING IT LESS LIKELY
THAT THAT WOULD OCCUR, AND THEN
IN ADDITION, THERE IS THE FACT


[Captioner] 19:40:53
THAT THE CHIEF LAID OUT IN TERMS
OF HOW HIS DEPARTMENT WOULD
ENFORCE IT UNDER THE


[Captioner] 19:40:54
CIRCUMSTANCES.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU FOR THE
CLARIFICATION.


[Captioner] 19:40:59
AT THIS TIME I'LL TURN IT BACK
TO THE COUNCIL MEMBERS.
DO YOU HAVE ANOTHER CLARIFYING


[Captioner] 19:41:01
QUESTION?
OTHERWISE IF SOMEONE IS MAKING A
MOTION.


[Captioner] 19:41:08
OKAY.
I SEE A COUPLE COUNCILMEMBERS,
BUT GO AHEAD, IF YOU WANT TO


[Captioner] 19:41:12
MAKE THE MOTION, BUT I DON'T
KNOW IF ANYONE HAS A CLARIFYING
QUESTION TOO.


[Captioner] 19:41:22
>> Councilmember Cox: I WOULD
LIKE TO ADD A MOTION BUT I WOULD
LIKE TO HAVE IT REVISITED IN SIX


[Captioner] 19:41:28
MONTHS JUST TO SEE HOW WELL IT'S
WORKING WITH THE NEW ORDINANCE.
IS THAT SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE


[Captioner] 19:41:33
POSSIBLE TO SEE HOW EFFECTIVE IT
IS?
>> City Mgr. Shackelford: AN


[Captioner] 19:41:36
UPDATE TO THE COUNCIL?
>> Councilmember Cox: YES.
>> City Mgr. Shackelford: WE CAN


[Captioner] 19:41:40
DO THAT.
>> Mayor Mei: IS SIX MONTHS --
>> Councilmember Cox: THAT'S WHY


[Captioner] 19:41:43
I WANT TO HEAR FROM OUR POLICE
CHIEF WASHINGTON, IF THAT'S
ENOUGH TIME.


[Captioner] 19:41:49
>> City Mgr. Shackelford: AND WE
CAN ALSO -- WE CAN MONITOR IT
AND WE CAN DISCUSS IT DURING


[Captioner] 19:41:54
COUNCIL BRIEFINGS AS WELL.
>> Mayor Mei: I WOULD BE
SUPPORTIVE OF THE IDEA OF JUST


[Captioner] 19:42:00
HAVING A REPORT OUT SO WE COULD
HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SEE HOW
THINGS ARE GOING.


[Captioner] 19:42:03
I THINK THAT'S ALWAYS A PRUDENT
OPTION BUT I WOULD DEFER TO
STAFF IN TERMS OF THE TIMING.


[Captioner] 19:42:08
I KNOW THERE IS CERTAIN TIME
THAT WE HAVE DO HAVE OUR CRIME
REPORT THAT'S UPDATED ANYWAYS


[Captioner] 19:42:11
STATISTICALLY.
>> City Mgr. Shackelford: CHIEF,
WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT THE


[Captioner] 19:42:15
TIMING?
>> YES, WE CAN CERTAINLY TAKE
THAT BACK AND DISCUSS THAT WITH


[Captioner] 19:42:24
OUR STAFF AND COME UP WITH SOME
SORT OF PERIODIC UPDATE AND
BRIEF ON HOW THIS IS GOING AND


[Captioner] 19:42:27
UPDATED STATISTICS ON HOW MANY
OF THESE EVENT THAT WE'VE HAD.
SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT OUR


[Captioner] 19:42:32
STAFF CAN CERTAINLY DO.
>> Councilmember Cox: SIX MONTHS
IS ENOUGH?


[Captioner] 19:42:39
>> I THINK A HALF A YEAR, WE
COULD COME UP WITH SOME DATA IN
A HALF A YEAR, IN SIX MONTHS, TO


[Captioner] 19:42:47
BE ABLE TO HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO
PROVIDE THE DATA TO YOU ALL.
I WILL CAUTION THAT THE DATA MAY


[Captioner] 19:42:56
NOT BE THAT ACCURATE AS WE GO
INTO THE WINTER MONTHS.
THESE TYPE OF ACTIVITIES TEND TO


[Captioner] 19:43:01
DIE DOWN, SO AS WE TRANSITION
OUT OF SUMMER AND INTO THE
WINTER MONTHS, ESPECIALLY IF WE


[Captioner] 19:43:06
HAVE WEATHER, IF WE HAVE A
DRASTIC DECLINE TO LIKE FIVE OF
THESE INCIDENTS, IT MAY NOT


[Captioner] 19:43:11
PAINT THE ACCURATE PICTURE OF
JUST HOW OFTEN THESE INCIDENTS
ARE OCCURRING.


[Captioner] 19:43:15
>> Councilmember Cox: THAT'S NOT
A PROBLEM, BECAUSE YOU CAN
DOCUMENT THAT AS PART OF THE


[Captioner] 19:43:19
REVIEW AND REPORTING BACK OUT.
I WOULDN'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH
THAT.


[Captioner] 19:43:23
>> OKAY.
>> Mayor Mei: SO WE HAVE A
MOTION.


[Captioner] 19:43:30
DO WE HAVE A SECOND?
I THINK COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN AND
KENG BOTH, BUT I THINK SALWAN IS


[Captioner] 19:43:33
CLOSER.
I APOLOGIZE.
NEXT TIME WE'LL HAVE TO HAVE


[Captioner] 19:43:38
PEOPLE USE THE BUTTONS.
WELCOME BACK TO TECHNOLOGY.
SO CAN WE GET A ROLL CALL FOR


[Captioner] 19:43:46
THIS, PLEASE?
>> THROUGH THE MAYOR?
>> Mayor Mei: YES, YOU HAVE TO


[Captioner] 19:43:50
READ THE ORDINANCE.
>> THANK YOU, MAYOR.
THIS EVENING, IF THE MOTION


[Captioner] 19:43:54
SUCCEEDS, THE COUNCIL WILL BE
INTRODUCING AN ORDINANCE OF THE
CITY OF FREMONT AMENDING FREMONT


[Captioner] 19:44:06
MUNICIPAL CODE TITLE 9, PUBLIC
PEACE MORALS AND WELFARE,
SPECIFICALLY TO CHAPTERS SECTION


[Captioner] 19:44:21
9.35.010, 9.35.030 AND ADDING
SECTIONS 9.35090, 9.35100 AND
9.35110.


[Captioner] 19:44:25
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU, WE HAVE
A MOTION AND A SECOND.
COULD WE HAVE A ROLL CALL VOTE,


[Captioner] 19:44:28
PLEASE?
THANK YOU.
>> Ms. Gauthier: COUNCILMEMBER


[Captioner] 19:44:32
COX, AYE.
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN, AYE.
COUNCILMEMBER SHAO, AYE.


[Captioner] 19:44:36
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN IS MARKED
ABSENT.
COUNCILMEMBER JONES, AYE.


[Captioner] 19:44:42
COUNCILMEMBER KENG, AYE.
MAYOR MEI, AYE.
>> Mayor Mei: SO THE MOTION


[Captioner] 19:44:48
PASSES UNANIMOUSLY WITH OUR
COUNCILMEMBER ABSENT, ONE
COUNCILMEMBER ABSENT.


[Captioner] 19:44:53
THANK YOU.
AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE
REPORT AND HOPEFULLY THIS HAD


[Captioner] 19:44:56
 WILL
HELP US ADDRESS SOME OF THE
CONCERNS WE'VE BEEN HEARING FROM


[Captioner] 19:45:05
MULTIPLE PARTS OF OUR CITY.
NEXT IS ITEM 8.2, WHICH IS
APPOINTMENTS TO ADVISORY BODIES.


[Captioner] 19:45:12
THERE IS AN APPOINTMENT TO THE
MOBILITY COMMISSION.
>> Ms. Gauthier: MADAME MAYOR,


[Captioner] 19:45:16
YOU MISSED 8.1, YOUR REFERRAL.
>> Mayor Mei: SORRY, TWO
REFERRALS.


[Captioner] 19:45:19
SORRY.
FIRST IS 8.1, WHICH IS THE
REFERRAL ON HOMELESSNESS


[Captioner] 19:45:31
MITIGATION POLICIES.
AND I CAN READ THAT.
AND SO I WANTED TO NOTE FIRST


[Captioner] 19:45:36
THAT THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF
MOVEMENTS IN SURROUNDING
NEIGHBORING CITIES AT THIS TIME


[Captioner] 19:45:43
THAT WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF THE
FEEDBACK AND ACTIONS THAT HAVE
BEEN OCCURRING IN MOUNTAIN VIEW,


[Captioner] 19:45:50
IN SAN JOSÉ, AND WHILE WE ARE
DEFINITELY A COMPASSIONATE CITY
AND WE'VE TAKEN MANY ACTIONS TO


[Captioner] 19:45:57
ADDRESS THE CONCERNS OF 
HOMELESSNESS FROM HAVING THE
WINTER WARMING CENTER, THE


[Captioner] 19:46:04
MOBILE HYGIENE UNIT, CLEAN 
START, THE HOUSING NAVIGATION
CENTER AND ALSO OUR SAFE PARKING


[Captioner] 19:46:11
THAT WE'VE STARTED TO IMPLEMENT.
I WANTED THE STAFF TO BE ABLE TO
UNDERSTAND, WE'VE ALSO HAD SOME


[Captioner] 19:46:17
CONCERNS THIS PAST COUPLE WEEKS
THAT HAVE BEEN ONGOING FOR SOME
TIME TO REVIEW THE MUNICIPAL


[Captioner] 19:46:22
OPTIONS.
IN PARTICULAR, WE'VE HAD SEVERAL
FIRES AND A LOT OF FEEDBACK FROM


[Captioner] 19:46:28
THE BUSINESSES AND I'M NOT
SAYING THAT ALL ILLEGAL DUMPING
AND THE QUESTION OF THAT OR THE


[Captioner] 19:46:33
RELATED CLEAN-UP IS PERTAINING
TO THIS, BUT I WANTED TO
UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENT


[Captioner] 19:46:37
MUNICIPAL OPTIONS THAT ARE
AVAILABLE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE
ARE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THOSE,


[Captioner] 19:46:44
AND UNDERSTAND THOSE.
I ALSO WANTED TO NOTE, AND IT'S
OF GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT TO ME, I


[Captioner] 19:46:49
KNOW WE HAD SUBMITTED AN
APPLICATION FOR PROJECT HOMEKEY,
AND OUR SURROUNDING CITIES, SOME


[Captioner] 19:46:53
OF THEM DID GET IT, NEWARK DID
GET IT AND SOME OTHER CITIES,
AND WE WERE NOT AWARDED THE


[Captioner] 19:46:57
GRANT FOR THAT.
THERE IS A ROUND THREE THAT'S
COMING UP, SO WE ARE ALSO


[Captioner] 19:47:03
SUBMITTING FOR THAT AGAIN.
BUT I WANTED THE PUBLIC TO KNOW
THAT WE ARE SUPPORTIVE OF IT AND


[Captioner] 19:47:07
I'D WRITTEN A LETTER IN
PARTICULAR ON BEHALF OF ALL THE
MAYORS FOR ALAMEDA COUNTY TO


[Captioner] 19:47:12
SUPPORT THE PROJECT HOMEKEYS.
SO THAT IS WHERE IT STANDS
CURRENTLY.


[Captioner] 19:47:19
AND SO I'D ASKED THE STAFF TO
REVIEW THE MUNICIPAL OPTIONS AND
PARTICULARLY UNDERSTANDING HOW


[Captioner] 19:47:22
THE CONCERNS ARE FOR HEALTH
HAZARDS.
WE'VE SEEN THE FIRES THAT HAVE


[Captioner] 19:47:29
ALSO OCCURRED UNDER SOME OF THE
FREEWAY UNDERPASSES AND OTHER
AREAS, SO I'M JUST TRYING TO


[Captioner] 19:47:33
UNDERSTAND, WHAT ARE THE RELATED
OPTIONS THAT WE HAVE TO ADDRESS
THIS.


[Captioner] 19:47:42
AND SO AT THIS TIME, I'M SURE --
OR WE HAD ALREADY SOME PEOPLE
WRITE COMMENTS TO US ALREADY,


[Captioner] 19:47:47
AND SO I DON'T KNOW IF WE WANT
TO OPEN THAT UP TO FIRST THE
PUBLIC COMMENTS?


[Captioner] 19:47:54
I THINK THERE ARE PROBABLY SOME
PEOPLE WHO WERE SENDING US
FEEDBACK, BUT I DON'T KNOW, MISS


[Captioner] 19:47:58
GAUTHIER, IS THERE ANYONE ON THE
ZOOM RIGHT NOW?
>> Ms. Gauthier: WE HAVE FIVE.


[Captioner] 19:48:07
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY.
>> Ms. Gauthier: FIRST SPEAKER
IS SHARON.


[Captioner] 19:48:23
>> Mayor Mei: WELCOME, SHARON.
>> Ms. Gauthier: SHARON, YOU
NEED TO UNMUTE YOURSELF, PLEASE.


[Captioner] 19:48:40
WE'LL MOVE ON TO ANNIE KORUGA.
>> Mayor Mei: WELCOME, ANNIE.
>> I AM A RESIDENT HERE IN


[Captioner] 19:48:47
FREMONT, AND OF COURSE NO ONE
INCLUDING ME WANTS TO HAVE A
TRASH-FILLED CITY OR A 


[Captioner] 19:48:54
TRASH-FILLED ENVIRONMENT.
AND OF COURSE I DON'T WANT 
LITTER OR DUMPING ALL AROUND OUR


[Captioner] 19:48:59
CITY.
I'M REALLY INTERESTED IN LOOKING
AT THE ROOT CAUSES AND THEN


[Captioner] 19:49:06
ADDRESSING THOSE ROOT CAUSES OF
WHY THIS DUMPING IS APPEARING TO
BE AN INCREASING PROBLEM.


[Captioner] 19:49:13
I'D REMIND EVERYONE THAT
SOMETIMES INCREASED PUBLICLY
VISIBLE TRASH INCREASES AS THE


[Captioner] 19:49:18
UNSHELTERED POPULATION 
INCREASES.
BECAUSE UNHOUSED PEOPLE


[Captioner] 19:49:24
GENERALLY DON'T HAVE AS READILY
AVAILABLE ACCESS TO APPROPRIATE
TRASH DISPOSAL OPTIONS.


[Captioner] 19:49:31
AND AS HOUSED PEOPLE, MYSELF
INCLUDED, DIDN'T HAVE A WEEKLY
TRASH PICKUP WHERE THE GARBAGE


[Captioner] 19:49:36
TRUCK CAME AND THE RECYCLING
TRUCK CAME EVERY WEEK, I THINK
THAT TRASH PROBABLY WOULD START


[Captioner] 19:49:41
TO PILE UP TOO, AND IN ALL OF
OUR NEIGHBORHOODS.
AND THAT'S TO SAY LET'S NOT


[Captioner] 19:49:48
BLAME THIS POTENTIAL INCREASE IN
DUMPING AND INCREASE IN PUBLICLY
VISIBLE TRASH AND PERHAPS


[Captioner] 19:49:56
INAPPROPRIATE PLACES ON UNHOUSED
PEOPLE WHO LIKELY DON'T HAVE
ACCESS TO THE SAME SERVICES AND


[Captioner] 19:50:03
THE SAME TRASH PICKUP SOLUTIONS.
AND THE SOLUTION ISN'T TO
CRIMINALIZE PEOPLE ATTEMPTING TO


[Captioner] 19:50:09
SURVIVE, WHETHER THAT'S BECAUSE
THEY DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO A
GARBAGE TRUCK EVERY WEEK, OR


[Captioner] 19:50:14
BECAUSE IT WAS COLD AND THEY LIT
A FIRE TO KEEP WARM BECAUSE THEY
DON'T HAVE A ROOF OVER THEIR


[Captioner] 19:50:21
HEAD.
OF COURSE THESE AREN'T IDEAL
SCENARIOS, BUT I DON'T THINK


[Captioner] 19:50:23
THAT CRIMINALIZING PEOPLE
ATTEMPTING TO SURVIVE IS THE
SOLUTION.


[Captioner] 19:50:30
IT DOESN'T ADDRESS THE ROOT
CAUSE OF WHY THAT WAS OCCURRING
IN THE FIRST PLACE.


[Captioner] 19:50:35
ON THE OTHER HAND, I WOULD BE
INTERESTED IN LOOKING AT 
PROVIDING INCREASED TRACK


[Captioner] 19:50:43
 INCREASED TRASH
COLLECTION SERVICES FOR UNHOUSED
PEOPLE AND ALSO AT KNOWN


[Captioner] 19:50:46
ENCAMPMENTS.
I'M NOT SURE IF OTHER
MUNICIPALITIES HAVE PROVIDED OR


[Captioner] 19:50:50
INCREASED THOSE SERVICES, SO
THAT'S SOMETHING I WOULD SUGGEST
THAT PERHAPS WE AS FREMONT COULD


[Captioner] 19:50:55
LOOK INTO.
I'M ALSO NOT IN FAVOR OF 
HOMELESS SWEEPS THAT, AGAIN,


[Captioner] 19:51:01
CRIMINALIZE UNHOUSED PEOPLE AND
OFTENTIMES DESTROY THEIR FEW
BELONGINGS.


[Captioner] 19:51:06
THAT'S NOT -- THAT'S NOT A
COMPASSIONATE PRACTICE.
AND WE NEED TO TREAT OUR 


[Captioner] 19:51:11
UNHOUSED NEIGHBORS WITH RESPECT
BECAUSE WHETHER OR NOT YOU HAVE
A ROOF OVER YOUR HEAD DOESN'T


[Captioner] 19:51:15
DETERMINE WHETHER YOU DESERVE TO
BE TREATED WITH RESPECT AS A
FULL MEMBER OF THIS COMMUNITY.


[Captioner] 19:51:20
ADDITIONALLY IN CLOSING, JUST
BECAUSE OTHER CITIES DO
SOMETHING DOESN'T NECESSARILY


[Captioner] 19:51:26
MEAN THAT FREMONT SHOULD.
WE SHOULD REMAIN A COMPASSIONATE
CITY WITH COMPASSIONATE


[Captioner] 19:51:30
PRINCIPLES, AND, OF COURSE,
LET'S LOOK AT THE ROOT CAUSE OF
WHY THIS PROBLEM IS OCCURRING.


[Captioner] 19:51:35
BUT LET'S NOT BLAME THE MOST
VULNERABLE PEOPLE WHO ARE JUST
TRYING TO SURVIVE.


[Captioner] 19:51:44
THANK YOU.
>> Ms. Gauthier: LISA DANZ.
>> HI, THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:51:50
MY NAME IS LISA DANZ, AND I LIVE
IN THE SUNDALE NEIGHBORHOOD.
SO THIS AS I UNDERSTAND IT IS


[Captioner] 19:51:55
PRIMARILY A DATA GATHERING ITEM
DIRECTING STAFF TO GATHER DATA,
AND I LIKE GATHERING DATA.


[Captioner] 19:52:00
GATHERING DATA CAN HELP YOU MAKE
BETTER DECISIONS.
BUT YOU'RE GOING TO GET VERY


[Captioner] 19:52:04
DIFFERENT RESULTS BASED ON WHAT
QUESTIONS YOU ASK.
AND THE ITEM IS SOMEWHAT BROADLY


[Captioner] 19:52:08
DEFINING, YOU KNOW, WHAT HAS
WORKED, WHAT'S BEEN SUCCESSFUL
IN OTHER CITIES, AND I THINK WE


[Captioner] 19:52:14
NEED TO BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT WHAT
SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE.
IN PARTICULAR, IF THERE'S ANY


[Captioner] 19:52:18
NEGATIVE IMPACT ON UNHOUSED
COMMUNITY MEMBERS, THAT SHOULD
NOT BE CONSIDERED A SUCCESSFUL


[Captioner] 19:52:23
INTERVENTION.
SUCCESSFUL INTERVENTIONS SHOULD
HELP OUR UNHOUSED NEIGHBORS,


[Captioner] 19:52:27
MAKING THEIR LIVING AREA SAFER
AND HEALTHIER AND ALSO MOVING
TOWARD PERMANENT HOUSING,


[Captioner] 19:52:33
BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW AS THE MAYOR
ALLUDED TO A FEW MINUTES AGO
THAT PERMANENT HOUSING IS THE


[Captioner] 19:52:38
ACTUAL SOLUTION TO HOMELESSNESS.
TO THAT END, I ABSOLUTELY SHARE
YOUR FRUSTRATION WITH NOT


[Captioner] 19:52:41
GETTING THE HOMEKEY FUNDING.
I HOPE THAT WE'LL CONTINUE 
TRYING TO GET THAT IN FUTURE


[Captioner] 19:52:44
ROUNDS, BUT I ALSO HOPE THAT WE
DON'T PIN ALL OF OUR HOPES ON
THAT.


[Captioner] 19:52:49
WE NEED TO LOOK AT OTHER WAYS TO
MAKE HOUSING MORE NATURALLY
AFFORDABLE, AND I KNOW THAT THE


[Captioner] 19:52:55
HOUSING ELEMENT PROCESS HAS BEEN
A PART OF THAT AND I JUST WANT
US TO KEEP OUR EYE ON THAT AS


[Captioner] 19:53:00
WELL.
AND SINCE THIS IS, LIKE I SAID,
OR LIKE I NOTED BEFORE, A


[Captioner] 19:53:04
RESEARCH ITEM, I HOPE THAT THAT
WILL BE PART OF THE RESEARCH,
THAT WE CAN LOOK AT WHICH CITIES


[Captioner] 19:53:13
HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN BRINGING
DOWN THE COST OF HOUSING.
YEAH, THAT'S PRETTY MUCH ALL I


[Captioner] 19:53:17
HAVE TO SAY.
JUST PLEASE MAKE SURE TO BE
LOOKING AT THIS FROM THE LENS OF


[Captioner] 19:53:20
THE WELL-BEING OF OUR UNHOUSED
NEIGHBORS.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:53:31
>> Ms. Gauthier: THANK YOU.
THE NEXT SPEAKER IS KELLY ABREU.
>> THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:53:38
I DON'T HAVE MUCH OF A PROBLEM
OR MANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS
PARTICULAR REFERRAL, BUT I DO


[Captioner] 19:53:46
HAVE AN ISSUE WITH THE NATURE OF
THE REFERRAL PROCESS AS IT IS
BEING PRACTICED BY THIS BOARD


[Captioner] 19:53:54
AND BY THEIR STAFF.
YOU KNOW, WHEN A REFERRAL IS
ISSUED IN PAST, AND SANCTIONED


[Captioner] 19:54:02
BY THE CITY COUNCIL, YOU KNOW,
AND EVERYONE VOTES TO APPROVE
THE REFERRAL, THEN THERE NEEDS


[Captioner] 19:54:06
TO BE FOLLOW-UP.
FOR EXAMPLE, A LITTLE OVER A
YEAR AGO, COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN


[Captioner] 19:54:13
ISSUED A -- SPONSORED A REFERRAL
ON AN ANIMAL ORDINANCE AND 
ASKING YOUR STAFF TO GO OUT


[Captioner] 19:54:16
THERE AND LOOK AT THE ANIMAL
ORDINANCE AND COME BACK WITH
RECOMMENDATIONS.


[Captioner] 19:54:22
THERE'S NO TIME LINES ON THESE
REFERRALS, SO AS OF NOW, THERE'S
BEEN NO FOLLOW-UP.


[Captioner] 19:54:28
AND THE EXACT SAME PEOPLE, THE
EXACT SAME STAFF RESOURCES ARE
GOING TO BE OUT THERE LOOKING AT


[Captioner] 19:54:34
THIS GARBAGE DUMP CLEAN-UP FOR
THE HOMELESS REFERRAL TOO,
BECAUSE IT'S THE SAME PEOPLE


[Captioner] 19:54:39
OVER THERE THAT HAVE TO DO THIS
WORK.
SO YOU KNOW, I THINK THAT THESE


[Captioner] 19:54:45
REFERRALS NEED TO BE 
STREAMLINED, THEY NEED TO BE
ORGANIZED.


[Captioner] 19:54:49
YOU KNOW, THERE NEEDS TO BE SOME
KIND OF -- THE PROCESS CANNOT BE
SLOPPY AND DISORGANIZED.


[Captioner] 19:54:55
THERE NEEDS TO BE A TIMELINE,
THERE NEEDS TO BE A QUEUE, YOU
KNOW, SOME TYPE OF ORDER, SOME


[Captioner] 19:55:00
TYPE OF FOLLOW-UP BY MAYBE, I
DON'T KNOW, THE CITY MANAGER,
SOMEBODY, THE CITY ATTORNEY,


[Captioner] 19:55:06
SOMEBODY NEEDS TO GO OUT THERE,
DIG UP THESE OLD REFERRALS, AND
FIGURE OUT WHAT ARE YOU DOING


[Captioner] 19:55:13
ABOUT THEM, AND WHY CAN'T YOU
COME BACK TO THE CITY COUNCIL
WITH RESPONSE TO THE REFERRAL IN


[Captioner] 19:55:18
SOME REASONABLE TIME FRAME,
MAYBE EVEN DEFINE THE TIME
FRAME.


[Captioner] 19:55:25
WHY IS THIS AN OPEN-ENDED TIME
FRAME?
YOU CAN LOCK IT DOWN TO 90 DAYS.


[Captioner] 19:55:29
MAYBE YOU CAN ALSO COME BACK AND
FOLLOW UP ON THAT ANIMAL
ORDINANCE.


[Captioner] 19:55:36
THANK YOU.
>> Ms. Gauthier: CHRIS IS THE
NEXT SPEAKER.


[Captioner] 19:55:46
CHRIS.
>> THANK YOU.
I'M GOING TO MAKE TWO POINTS


[Captioner] 19:55:56
HERE.
THE FIRST ONE IS, YOU GUYS DID A
SAFE PARKING STRATEGY IN MAY OF


[Captioner] 19:56:01
2021, YOU GUYS CONSIDERED IT, IN
JUNE OF 2021, YOU GUYS ADOPTED
AN ORDINANCE.


[Captioner] 19:56:12
IN JULY YOU CONTINUED TO WORK ON
THE PROGRAM AND APPROVE IT.
BUT I CAN'T SEE ANYWHERE WHERE


[Captioner] 19:56:24
THE CITY OPERATED SAFE PARKING
PROGRAM WAS IMPLEMENTED.
YOU LEFT THE TIMELINE OUT FOR


[Captioner] 19:56:28
THAT, BUT YOU SEEMED TO SAY THAT
YOU'RE GOING TO WORK ON THIS AND
IT A YEAR LATER, I HAVEN'T SEEN


[Captioner] 19:56:33
ANYTHING.
I HAVEN'T SEEN ANY PROPERTY
DESIGNATED AS A SAFE PARKING


[Captioner] 19:56:38
PLACE TO INVESTIGATE.
I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU GUYS LOOK AT
USING THE PROPERTY YOU ALREADY


[Captioner] 19:56:45
OWN AT AUTOMALL FOR A SPORTS
CENTER THAT I SEE NO PLANS TO
EVER BUILD, EXCEPT YOU GUYS HAVE


[Captioner] 19:56:54
SPENT A LOT OF MONEY ON MAKING A
NICE CURTILAGE FROM THE ROAD, NO
ONE BOTHERS TO PULL THE WEEDS


[Captioner] 19:57:02
ALL THE TIME.
SO THIS SEEMS VERY BROAD, AND I
THINK WHEN YOU COME FORWARD WITH


[Captioner] 19:57:06
THESE BROAD THINGS, YOU SHOULD
BE REPORTING ON OTHER THINGS
YOU'VE DONE, LIKE THE NAVIGATION


[Captioner] 19:57:09
CENTER.
IT'S PAST TWO YEARS FROM WHEN
YOU ANNOUNCED OPENING IT.


[Captioner] 19:57:17
I UNDERSTAND YOU'VE PUSHED THE
TECHNICAL OPEN DATE TO OCTOBER.
BUT THE LAST REPORT IS BASICALLY


[Captioner] 19:57:23
ALMOST A YEAR OLD.
AND YOU'RE COMING HERE TO DO
MORE ABOUT HOUSING BUT YOU


[Captioner] 19:57:28
HAVEN'T SHOWN ANY OF THE STEPS
YOU GUYS HAVE TAKEN IN THE LAST
FEW YEARS AND SPENT MILLIONS ON,


[Captioner] 19:57:32
HAVE DONE ANYTHING TO IMPROVE IT
FOR A LARGE NUMBER OF THE 
PEOPLE.


[Captioner] 19:57:41
I DRIVE BY THE PEOPLE PARKED
AROUND THE INDUSTRIAL AREA IN
FREMONT OFF 880, AND IT 


[Captioner] 19:57:44
CONTINUES TO GROW AND THERE'S A
FIRE, SO YOU MOVE THEM TO
ANOTHER ROAD.


[Captioner] 19:57:50
BUT IT'S STILL THE SAME SET OF
PEOPLE IN RVs THERE THAT
AREN'T REALLY ABLE TO MOVE, AND


[Captioner] 19:57:54
YOU'RE DOING NOTHING TO DO A
LONG-TERM PLAN.
IF YOU GIVE THEM A PLACE TO 


[Captioner] 19:57:59
PARK, SOME RULES TO FOLLOW, AND
YOU BUILD A BATHROOM THERE, AND
TRY AND GET THEM JOBS, YOU MIGHT


[Captioner] 19:58:02
ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO MOVE THIS
FORWARD.
YOU GUYS KEEP SAYING ABOUT WHAT


[Captioner] 19:58:09
OTHER CITIES HAVE DONE.
WHEN YOU GUYS TALKED ABOUT SAFE
PARKING STRATEGY, YOU TALKED


[Captioner] 19:58:13
ABOUT HOW MOUNTAIN VIEW HAD DONE
IT AND THEREFORE YOU WERE GOING
TO DO IT, BUT YOU HAVEN'T DONE


[Captioner] 19:58:18
IT.
A SAFE PARKING PLACE I BELIEVE
PROVIDED BY THE CITY, AND YOU


[Captioner] 19:58:23
GUYS TO MY KNOWLEDGE HAVE NOT --
CAN'T FIND ANYTHING ON YOUR
WEBSITE ABOUT IT.


[Captioner] 19:58:31
WHEN I LOOK FOR REPORTS, ONLY
THINGS I SEE IS STUFF A YEAR OLD
TO PUT PLANS INTO PLACE AND YOU


[Captioner] 19:58:36
GUYS NEVER FINISHED MOVING
FORWARD WITH THE PLANS PARTIALLY
BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T FUND THEM.


[Captioner] 19:58:43
THANK YOU.
>> Ms. Gauthier: KATHERINE 
RUBIE.


[Captioner] 19:58:53
>> HI.
I SENT A VERY LENGTHY LETTER IN,
AND IT DIDN'T GET IN TIME FOR


[Captioner] 19:59:00
PEOPLE TO REVIEW IT PRIOR TO
MEETING SO I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT.
SO I'M JUST GOING TO TRY TO HIT


[Captioner] 19:59:13
SOME OF THE HIGH POINTS.
FIRST OF ALL, I COME FROM AN
UPPER MIDDLE CLASS FAMILY, I


[Captioner] 19:59:18
HAVE GOTTEN MARRIED, I HAVE HAD
A SON, I HAVE BEEN A HOMEOWNER,
I HAVE BEEN DIVORCED AND WALKED


[Captioner] 19:59:22
AWAY WITH NOTHING AND HAD TO
REBUILD MY LIFE.
I HAVE GOTTEN A DEGREE, I HAVE


[Captioner] 19:59:28
SERVED IN THE MILITARY.
I HAVE DONE EVERYTHING SOCIETY
HAS EVER EXPECTED ME TO DO.


[Captioner] 19:59:33
I HAVE BEEN WORKING SINCE I WAS
16 AND I'VE PAID INTO THE TAX
SYSTEM SINCE THEN.


[Captioner] 19:59:41
I'M PUSHING 60 NOW.
AND MY AGE AND DISABILITIES
FINALLY CAUGHT UP TO ME SOME


[Captioner] 19:59:51
YEARS AGO, AND I HAVE NO LONGER
BEEN ABLE TO WORK EFFICIENTLY IN
THE WORKPLACE SUFFICIENTLY TO


[Captioner] 20:00:01
EARN AN INCOME THAT WOULD BE
ABLE TO HELP ME CONTINUE PAYING
MY RENT AND ULTIMATELY IN 2019,


[Captioner] 20:00:06
I ENDED UP HOMELESS FOR SIX
MONTHS.
THE PROCESS I WENT THROUGH PRIOR


[Captioner] 20:00:19
TO THAT WAS HORRIBLE.
I HAVE BEEN THROUGH SO MUCH IN
TRYING TO FIND RESOURCES TO KEEP


[Captioner] 20:00:26
MYSELF FROM BECOMING HOMELESS
ONCE I HAD USED UP ALL OF MY OWN
RESOURCES.


[Captioner] 20:00:35
AND AS A HOMELESS PERSON, HAVING
BEEN OUT IN THE HOMELESS
COMMUNITY, THERE ARE MANY THINGS


[Captioner] 20:00:43
THAT I HAVE REALIZED, AND THAT
IS, THE GENERAL COMMUNITY HAVE A
GENERAL HATRED TOWARDS THE 


[Captioner] 20:00:53
HOMELESS, AND I CAN SEE WHY.
IT BECAUSE THERE'S ALREADY A
PRECONCEPTION TOWARDS 


[Captioner] 20:01:00
STEREOTYPES OF PEOPLE BEING
ADDICTS AND CRIMINALS AND LAZY
AND IRRESPONSIBLE.


[Captioner] 20:01:05
AND MENTALLY ILL.
AND THAT IS TRUE FOR SOME 
PEOPLE, BUT THE LARGE MAJORITY


[Captioner] 20:01:13
OF HOMELESS PEOPLE ARE NOT LIKE
THAT AT ALL.
AND WHEN YOU ARE CREATING A


[Captioner] 20:01:19
SITUATION WHERE WORKING PEOPLE,
I STILL HAD A JOB WHEN I BECAME
HOMELESS -- WHEN WORKING PEOPLE


[Captioner] 20:01:28
CAN NO LONGER AFFORD TO STAY IN
THEIR HOME, AND AFFORDABLE
HOUSING IS NOT AVAILABLE,


[Captioner] 20:01:33
THERE'S LITTLE CHOICE BUT TO
LIVE IN A PERSON'S CAR.
AND WHEN YOU BECOME HOMELESS,


[Captioner] 20:01:39
YOU PRETTY MUCH LOSE ALL OF YOUR
RIGHTS TO GET AN I.D. UPDATED,
YOUR REGISTRATION, YOUR CAR


[Captioner] 20:01:46
INSURANCE AND ALL KINDS OF OTHER
THINGS THAT YOU CANNOT DO.
WITHOUT AN I.D., YOU CAN'T GET A


[Captioner] 20:01:52
JOB.
WITHOUT A RELIABLE CAR, WITHOUT
A LEGAL CAR, YOU DON'T HAVE A


[Captioner] 20:01:55
LOT OF CHOICE --
>> Ms. Gauthier: YOUR TIME IS
UP.


[Captioner] 20:02:11
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
>> Ms. Gauthier: SHARON.
SHARON.


[Captioner] 20:02:21
>> ARE YOU STILL THERE?
>> Ms. Gauthier: YES.
>> SORRY ABOUT THAT.


[Captioner] 20:02:27
I KNOW YOU GUYS HAVE MISSED ME.
BUT A COUPLE OF COMMENTS
TONIGHT.


[Captioner] 20:02:40
THE SIDESHOWS ARE TERRIBLE.
BUT I THINK FREMONT HAS BIGGER
FISH TO FRY FOR OUR POLICE


[Captioner] 20:02:50
DEPARTMENT.
AND YOU GUYS WANT A RAISE ACROSS
THE BOARD?


[Captioner] 20:03:00
YOU HIRED MARK DANAJ AS -- SUE
WE'RE ON THE HOMELESS POLICIES
REFERRAL.


[Captioner] 20:03:03
>> OKAY.
WILL I HAVE A CHANCE TO TALK
LATER OR NOT?


[Captioner] 20:03:11
>> Ms. Gauthier: WE'RE UNDER THE
HOMELESS -- MAYOR MEI'S REFERRAL
ON HOMELESSNESS MITIGATION AT


[Captioner] 20:03:16
THIS TIME.
>> OKAY.
WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS NOT


[Captioner] 20:03:22
EFFECTIVE.
AND IT'S DAMAGING.
AND EVERYBODY SEES IT, AND LIVES


[Captioner] 20:03:30
WITH IT.
SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT SIDESHOWS,
WHICH ARE TERRIBLE, CRIME WHICH


[Captioner] 20:03:41
IS TERRIBLE, BUT WE'VE LOST OUR
WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD, AND THE
POLICE HAVE NO RESPONSIBILITY TO


[Captioner] 20:03:45
THE CITY TO DO THAT.
>> Mayor Mei: MA'AM, DID YOU
WANT TO COMMENT ON THE HOMELESS


[Captioner] 20:03:49
ITEM?
>> WELL, THAT IS PRETTY MUCH THE
HOMELESS, CORRECT?


[Captioner] 20:03:56
>> Mayor Mei: WELL, ARE YOU
SAYING -- I GUESS YOUR COMMENT
IS JUST IN GENERAL THAT YOU'VE


[Captioner] 20:04:02
LOST THE NEIGHBORHOOD?
BECAUSE I'M TRYING TO FIGURE 
OUT -- WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE


[Captioner] 20:04:08
HOMELESS REFERRAL.
>> THE HOMELESS, AS FAR AS I'M
CONCERNED, FREMONT HAS GIVEN AN


[Captioner] 20:04:18
OPEN DOOR TO COME IN AND -- IT'S
LIKE A CAMPING GROUND.
WHAT WE CAN DO TO SOLVE IT?


[Captioner] 20:04:27
WE SHOULD HAVE SPENT MORE MONEY
PUTTING THEM IN SAFE PLACES THAN
JUST LETTING THEM POPULATE OUR


[Captioner] 20:04:30
PARKS.
AND YET THE POLICE ARE MORE
CONCERNED WITH SIDESHOWS.


[Captioner] 20:04:45
SO THAT'S MY COMMENT.
AND FOR YOU GUYS TO GET RAISES
WITH THE PAST PERFORMANCE IS


[Captioner] 20:04:53
PRETTY FUNNY.
THAT'S IT.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:04:57
I'LL BRING IT BACK TO COUNCIL
FOR SOME COMMENTS.
>> Ms. Gauthier: WE HAVE JOHN


[Captioner] 20:04:59
HINDS.
>> Mayor Mei: OH.
WELCOME, JOHN.


[Captioner] 20:05:07
>> HELLO, EVERYONE.
I JUST WANT TO SECOND KELLY'S
COMMENT ON THE VALUE OF HAVING A


[Captioner] 20:05:14
SIMPLE TRACKING LIST FOR
FOLLOWING DOWN THE REFERRALS.
WITH A STATUS FOR EACH, AN


[Captioner] 20:05:18
EXPECTED DELIVERY DATE FOR EACH
SO THEY DON'T FALL THROUGH THE
CRACKS EASILY.


[Captioner] 20:05:25
THANK YOU.
>> Ms. Gauthier: THE LAST
SPEAKER IS NAREN IMMADI.


[Captioner] 20:05:34
>> HELLO, EVERYONE.
I AM A RESIDENT OF CANYON
HEIGHTS NEIGHBORHOOD.


[Captioner] 20:05:47
SO BASICALLY I WOULD LIKE TO
TALK ABOUT A FEW THINGS LIKE IN
GENERAL, I AM LOOKING AT THIS


[Captioner] 20:05:55
MID YEAR COUNCIL DOCUMENT FOR
2022 FROM THE CITY WEBSITE.
AND REGARDING THE RESPONSES TO


[Captioner] 20:06:02
HOMELESSNESS, THERE WERE LIKE A
BUNCH OF POINTS MENTIONED.
THERE ARE THINGS LIKE GRAND 


[Captioner] 20:06:11
OPENING OF CITY CENTER 
APARTMENT, A 60-UNIT CITY FUNDED
AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECT, AND


[Captioner] 20:06:21
CITY-FUNDED AFFORDABLE HOUSING
PROJECTS WHICH WILL PROVIDE 341
AFFORDABLE UNITS INCLUDING 83


[Captioner] 20:06:25
UNITS SERVING EXTREMELY LOW
INCOME TENANTS, AND SO FORTH AND
SO ON.


[Captioner] 20:06:34
SO ALL THESE OTHER LOW INCOME
AFFORDABLE UNITS THAT WILL HOUSE
LOW INCOME TENANTS WILL HELP


[Captioner] 20:06:44
PEOPLE WHO ARE ESPECIALLY IN THE
VERGE OF BECOMING HOMELESS, BUT
AT THE SAME TIME, THERE WERE


[Captioner] 20:06:50
PEOPLE WHO WERE ALREADY 
HOMELESS.
SO REGARDING THOSE PEOPLE, I


[Captioner] 20:06:57
PERSONALLY FEEL THAT WE HAVE AN
OPPORTUNITY TO DO A LOT, BUT WE
ARE NOT DOING ENOUGH.


[Captioner] 20:07:06
I FEEL LIKE WITH RESPECT TO
TAKING CARE OF THOSE PEOPLE, THE
ONLY PROGRAM THAT SEEMS TO BEING


[Captioner] 20:07:11
 BE
VIABLE IS THE SAFE PARKING
PROGRAM, BUT ALL THAT I SEE IN


[Captioner] 20:07:19
THIS LATEST REPORT IS A
ONE-LINER THAT SAYS THIS PROGRAM
HAS -- LIVING IN THE VEHICLES,


[Captioner] 20:07:26
SIGNED UP ON THIS HOST AND 20
PEOPLE HAVE PARTICIPATED.
I THINK IT'S -- IF WE ARE JUST


[Captioner] 20:07:32
IN THE PROCESS OF STILL SIGNING
UP THE PLACES TO HAVE THIS SAFE
PARKING PROGRAM AND THERE ARE


[Captioner] 20:07:38
ONLY 20 PEOPLE PARTICIPATED, I
THINK IT'S TIME THAT WE HAVE TO
REVISIT THIS WHOLE THING AND SEE


[Captioner] 20:07:48
WHETHER THIS IS EVEN CONSIDERED
A SUCCESS AT THIS TIME.
AND ALSO LIKE I HAVE -- IF I'M


[Captioner] 20:07:55
REMEMBERING IT RIGHT, I HAVE
ATTENDED IN-PERSON MEETING IN
2019 AT WHICH POINT THE TEAM HAS


[Captioner] 20:08:01
BASICALLY GIVEN A PRESENTATION,
PEOPLE A PRESENTATION SHOWING
ALL THE THINGS THAT WERE


[Captioner] 20:08:07
CONSIDERED AND THEN THEY'RE
STILL UNDERSTANDING WHICH PLACE
CAN BE GIVEN THIS SAFE PARKING


[Captioner] 20:08:12
PROGRAM.
BUT FROM THEN ON, IT'S ALMOST
THREE YEARS, AND I FEEL LIKE WE


[Captioner] 20:08:15
HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING, THERE IS
NO PROGRESS ON THIS PARTICULAR
THING.


[Captioner] 20:08:25
IF WE HAVE DONE SOMETHING ON
THAT END, EVEN THE HISTORICAL
PARK IN THE NILES AREA WHERE WE


[Captioner] 20:08:33
CURRENTLY HAVE THIS HOUSED --
HOMELESS PEOPLE, THEY COULD ALSO
HAVE BEEN MIGRATED OR SOME OF


[Captioner] 20:08:38
THOSE SAFE PARKING LOTS WHICH
COULD HAVE BEEN HELPFUL.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:08:48
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
I WANTED TO COMMENT ON A COUPLE
THINGS.


[Captioner] 20:08:53
ONE, I THINK THERE WAS A
QUESTION REGARDING THE ORDINANCE
ON PET -- OR ANIMAL SERVICES,


[Captioner] 20:08:59
AND I WANTED TO LET PEOPLE KNOW
THAT IT WAS ON OUR WEBSITE AND I
THINK IT WAS PUBLICIZE ON OUR


[Captioner] 20:09:07
NEWSLETTER THAT THIS THURSDAY,
SEPTEMBER 8TH, THERE IS GOING TO
BE A MEETING WITH CAPTAIN NELSON


[Captioner] 20:09:16
AND THE ANIMAL SERVICES MANAGER
KELLY MIAT TO TALK ABOUT
PROPOSED ANIMAL ORDINANCE


[Captioner] 20:09:20
AMENDMENTS.
AND I THINK PARTIALLY IT WAS
DELAYED BECAUSE OF THE


[Captioner] 20:09:25
RE-OPENING, I THINK, IN TERMS OF
OUR ANIMAL SERVICES.
A LOT OF OUR STAFF, I THINK, IN


[Captioner] 20:09:29
THIS PANDEMIC HAVE BEEN
CHALLENGED, BUT WE DID NOT
FORGET ABOUT THAT, AND SO THAT'S


[Captioner] 20:09:34
WHY THERE IS A MEETING TO REVIEW
SOME OF THE PROPOSALS AND TO
DISCUSS THAT WITH THE PUBLIC TO


[Captioner] 20:09:40
GET INPUT BEFORE WE ARE TO
PRESENT THAT TO THE COUNCIL.
AND THAT IS THIS THURSDAY FROM


[Captioner] 20:09:44
6:30 TO 7:30.
IT IS A ZOOM MEETING, SO IF
PEOPLE ARE INTERESTED, IT'S ON


[Captioner] 20:09:54
OUR WEBSITE.
ON THE ANIMAL SHELTER AREA.
REGARDING THE QUESTION ON THE


[Captioner] 20:09:58
HOUSING ELEMENT PROCESS, WE ALSO
HAVE BEEN ASKING THE PUBLIC TO
PROVIDE FEEDBACK FOR THE PAST


[Captioner] 20:10:03
MONTH AND A HALF, AND THAT WILL
BE COMING BACK TO THE COUNCIL
FOR REVIEW.


[Captioner] 20:10:09
SO I WANTED TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE
KNEW THAT WE ARE ASKING PEOPLE
TO PROVIDE FEEDBACK.


[Captioner] 20:10:16
ON THE QUESTION ALSO REGARDING
THE SAFE PARKING, THERE HAVE
BEEN A COUPLE WAYS THAT WE'VE


[Captioner] 20:10:20
BEEN TRYING TO ADDRESS 
HOMELESSNESS THIS LAST COUPLE
YEARS.


[Captioner] 20:10:29
IN THE PAST YEAR, WE'VE GIVEN
OUT OVER 16 MILLION IN  RENTAL
ASSISTANCE.


[Captioner] 20:10:35
OVER 777 FAMILIES.
THERE IS REPORTING ON THAT
INFORMATION, AS WELL AS FOR OUR


[Captioner] 20:10:41
HOUSING NAVIGATION CENTER, WE
GAVE A SIX-MONTH REPORT, A 
ONE-YEAR REPORT AND THERE WILL


[Captioner] 20:10:47
BE A TWO-YEAR REPORT COMING OUT.
SO PLEASE NOTE THAT THAT WILL BE
COMING OUT, AS WELL AS THERE WAS


[Captioner] 20:10:51
INFORMATION DURING THIS TIME AND
PANDEMIC, WE TALKED ABOUT WHAT
TYPES OF HOUSING WERE AVAILABLE,


[Captioner] 20:10:59
AND WE HAD UTILIZED OUR ISLANDER
MOTEL IN THAT TIME PERIOD, AND I
BELIEVE WE WERE ABLE TO HOUSE --


[Captioner] 20:11:05
THIS IS OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD
APPROXIMATELY 70 PEOPLE, OFF THE
TOP OF MY HEAD.


[Captioner] 20:11:11
SO WE HAVE BEEN WORKING OUR WAY
THROUGH IN TERMS OF DIFFERENT
WAYS, WHETHER IT'S EXTENDING OUR


[Captioner] 20:11:15
WARMING SHELTER THE FIRST YEAR,
ADDING THE CLEAN START MOBILE
HYGIENE UNIT THE SECOND YEAR,


[Captioner] 20:11:21
ADDING THE HOUSING NAVIGATION
CENTER THE THIRD YEAR, WHICH HAS
REPORTING FOR SIX MONTHS, ONE


[Captioner] 20:11:27
YEAR, AND WE'LL HAVE ONE FOR TWO
YEARS, AND THEN ADDING THE SAFE
PARKING AND IN FACT THAT WAS


[Captioner] 20:11:33
ALSO IN OUR NEWSLETTER RIGHT 
NOW, SAYING TRI-CITY RESIDENTS
LIVING IN YOUR VEHICLES, HERE'S


[Captioner] 20:11:37
THE INFORMATION TO THE SAFE
PARKING HOST SITE, AS WELL AS A
PHONE NUMBER.


[Captioner] 20:11:42
AND I KNOW I WANTED TO THANK
SOME OF THE SPEAKERS, I KNOW
SOME OF YOU HAVE PARTICIPATED IN


[Captioner] 20:11:48
THAT.
ALSO DURING THE PANDEMIC, I KNOW
THERE'S A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT


[Captioner] 20:11:54
RESTROOM FACILITIES OR HYGIENE
FACILITIES IN ADDITION TO THE
MOBILE HYGIENE UNIT.


[Captioner] 20:11:59
I WENT OUT DURING THE POINT IN
TIME COUNT AND I KNOW THAT IN
PARTICULAR, IN CERTAIN AREAS,


[Captioner] 20:12:02
SOMEBODY HAD MENTIONED VALLEJO
MILLS, SOMEBODY MENTIONED THE
OTHER AREAS.


[Captioner] 20:12:13
WE DID ADD EXTRA BOTH PORT TA
POTTIES AS WELL AS TRASH 
DUMPSTERS AS WELL AS OTHER TRASH


[Captioner] 20:12:16
PICKUP.
I DON'T KNOW THE NUMBER OFF THE
TOP OF MY HEAD BUT I DO KNOW WE


[Captioner] 20:12:21
HAVE THE DATA IF YOU WOULD LIKE
TO KNOW HOW MANY TONS OF TRASH
WE HAVE SPENT TIME IN PICKING UP


[Captioner] 20:12:26
AS WELL AS THE COST OF THAT.
AND I KNOW OUR HUMAN SERVICES
DEPARTMENT HAS THAT.


[Captioner] 20:12:36
IN PARTICULAR, I KNOW BECAUSE WE
DO MEET AS MAYORS AT THE ALAMEDA
COUNTY MAYORS CONFERENCE, AS


[Captioner] 20:12:42
WELL AS WITH THE COUNTY OFFICES
AND TO REPORT OUT ON THIS
INFORMATION, AND SO I'M HAPPY TO


[Captioner] 20:12:46
SHARE ABOUT THAT.
BUT WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT RIGHT
NOW IS WHAT I WAS TRYING TO


[Captioner] 20:12:52
UNDERSTAND BETTER IN TERMS OF
WHAT OPTIONS ARE THERE.
WE CERTAINLY ARE TRYING TO BE


[Captioner] 20:12:56
HUMANITARIAN AND, IN FACT,
DURING THIS HEAT WAVE THAT WE
WERE GOING THROUGH, WE HAD 


[Captioner] 20:13:02
OPENED UP OUR COOLING CENTERS
AND IN PARTICULAR, I KNOW THAT
WE HAD ALSO MADE EXTRA EFFORT IN


[Captioner] 20:13:13
TERMS OF PROVIDING ASSISTANCE ON
THINGS LIKE WATER SERVICES AND
ACCESS TO WATER DELIVERY THIS


[Captioner] 20:13:18
LAST COUPLE DAYS.
WE ALSO HAVE OPENED UP AND
PARTICIPATED IN THE SOUTH COUNTY


[Captioner] 20:13:24
HOUSING RESOURCE CENTER TO
PROVIDE DROP-IN IN THIS TIME
PERIOD.


[Captioner] 20:13:29
I UNDERSTAND FULLY THE QUESTIONS
ABOUT LEGALITIES AND GETTING 
I.D.s AND OTHER THINGS, BUT


[Captioner] 20:13:35
WHAT SPECIFICALLY I'M ASKING FOR
ON THIS PIECE WAS JUST
UNDERSTANDING WHAT OTHER CITIES


[Captioner] 20:13:44
ARE LOOKING AT IN TERMS OF THE
DUMPING PIECE, WHICH IS NOT JUST
PARTICULAR TO THE -- JUST


[Captioner] 20:13:51
PERTINENT TO THE HOMELESS.
WE HAVE ILLEGAL DUMPING AND THAT
IS SOMETHING WE'RE LOOKING AT


[Captioner] 20:13:54
AND TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE
COST.
I WILL TELL YOU THAT I AM


[Captioner] 20:13:59
CONSTANTLY SEEKING SOLUTIONS,
WHETHER IT'S FUNDING, TALKING TO
HUD, AND I'VE SIGNED UP IN THE


[Captioner] 20:14:05
PAST, OUR MAYORS AND CEOs FOR
HOUSING AND INVESTMENT IN
PARTNERING WITH OTHER CITIES AND


[Captioner] 20:14:11
HAVE WORKED WITH HUD IN THIS
AREA AND I WILL BE CONTINUING TO
ADVOCATE FOR THAT FUNDING


[Captioner] 20:14:17
MECHANISMS.
AND I ALSO HAVE BEEN SEEKING
OTHER POSSIBLE COMMERCIAL


[Captioner] 20:14:22
PARTNERS IN TERMS OF THOSE WHO,
IF THEY WANT TO BE PARTNERS IN
OUR CITY, IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT


[Captioner] 20:14:27
BUILDING A BUSINESS OR PROFIT,
BUT BUILDING A COMMUNITY.
SO THAT'S WHY WITH SOME OF THESE


[Captioner] 20:14:33
PROGRAMS THAT WE'VE OFFERED AND
WORKING WITH SOME OF THE
EMPLOYERS IN PARTICULAR, WE'VE


[Captioner] 20:14:38
DONE UPSKILLING, WORKING WITH
OHLONE COLLEGE AND PROVIDING
FREE EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES,


[Captioner] 20:14:47
OR LIKE IN THE CASE OF MOST
RECENTLY SOMEONE LIKE BLOOM
ENERGY, LOOKING AT BOTH SALARY


[Captioner] 20:14:51
CONCERN OF LIVABLE WAGE AS WELL
AS FULL HEALTHCARE BENEFITS AND
ALSO EVEN EDUCATION TUITION


[Captioner] 20:14:56
CREDITS.
SO THIS IS NOT JUST ONE SHOT OR
ONE SIZE FITS ALL, BUT WE


[Captioner] 20:15:01
CONTINUALLY ARE LOOKING AT THIS,
AND I JUST WANTED TO BE ABLE TO
GET FEEDBACK HEARING FROM SO


[Captioner] 20:15:08
MANY OF OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS,
BOTH UNHOUSED, HOUSED, AS WELL
AS THE BUSINESSES AND RESIDENTS.


[Captioner] 20:15:13
I WANTED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT ARE
SOME OF THE ORDINANCES THAT
PERTAIN TO THIS, AND THAT WOULD


[Captioner] 20:15:17
ALLOW US THE BEST SUPPORT THAT'S
NEEDED.
AS FAR AS SOME OF THE QUESTIONS,


[Captioner] 20:15:25
I KNOW SOMEBODY COMMENTED ABOUT
THE PLACEMENT OF SOME OF THE
INDIVIDUALS, HOUSED AND 


[Captioner] 20:15:28
UNHOUSED.
THERE IS STILL AN EMERGENCY
ORDINANCE THAT IS ENACTED BY THE


[Captioner] 20:15:32
COUNTY, AND AT WHICH TIME, AND I
DON'T KNOW IF THE CITY ATTORNEY
OR CITY MANAGER WOULD LIKE TO


[Captioner] 20:15:39
COMMENT ON THAT, BUT AT THIS
TIME, WE ARE NOT ALLOWED TO MOVE
PEOPLE ASIDE FROM TAGGING,


[Captioner] 20:15:44
NOTIFYING, AND MOVING PEOPLE A
CERTAIN DISTANCE, WE'RE NOT
ALLOWED TO PHYSICALLY REMOVE


[Captioner] 20:15:49
PEOPLE UNLESS THERE'S PHYSICAL
DANGER OR HARM, BECAUSE OF THE
FACT THERE IS AN EMERGENCY


[Captioner] 20:15:55
ORDINANCE THAT HAS NOT BEEN
RELEASED FROM THE COUNTY.
SO I THINK THAT'S WHAT I WANTED


[Captioner] 20:16:00
TO RAISE TO THE COUNCIL.
AND ASK YOUR SUPPORT.
THIS IS RESEARCH, AND I


[Captioner] 20:16:04
APPRECIATE THAT THIS IS
SOMETHING WE ARE GOING TO LOOK
AT, BUT THIS IS NOT JUST


[Captioner] 20:16:09
RESEARCH IN THIS AREA.
WE CONTINUALLY LOOK AT RESEARCH
FROM OUR HUMAN SERVICES


[Captioner] 20:16:15
DEPARTMENT, FROM WORKING WITH
HUD, FROM WORKING OURSELVES WITH
OTHER CITIES.


[Captioner] 20:16:21
EVERY MEETING THAT WE HAVE FOR
ALAMEDA COUNTY MAYORS 
CONFERENCE, IN THE BEGINNING, WE


[Captioner] 20:16:26
DO TRY TO WORK TOGETHER AND I
KNOW SUZANNE SHENFIL AS WELL AS
LORI FLORES ON OUR TEAM AND


[Captioner] 20:16:29
OTHERS ARE CONSTANTLY LOOKING AT
THIS.
SO COUNCILMEMBER JONES, YOU HAVE


[Captioner] 20:16:32
A COMMENT ON THIS?
THANK YOU.
>> Councilmember Jones: THANK


[Captioner] 20:16:36
YOU, MADAME MAYOR.
I WAS JUST GOING TO COMMENT THAT
BEING THAT THIS IS A REFERRAL,


[Captioner] 20:16:40
IT WOULD PROBABLY BE PERTINENT
TO GET MORE DOWN INTO THE WEEDS
ONCE STAFF COMES BACK WITH ALL


[Captioner] 20:16:44
OF THE OPTION, RATHER THAN TO
TRY AND BRING A BUNCH OF THINGS
FORWARD NOW.


[Captioner] 20:16:51
LET'S FIND OUT WHAT OUR OPTIONS
ACTUALLY WILL BE, BOTH 
STAFF-WISE AND FISCAL-WISE.


[Captioner] 20:16:55
SO I'M READY TO MAKE A MOTION TO
APPROVE THE REFERRAL.
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY.


[Captioner] 20:17:00
MOTION BY COUNCILMEMBER JONES.
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN, ARE YOU
MAKING A SECOND OR DO YOU HAVE A


[Captioner] 20:17:03
COMMENT?
>> Vice Mayor Salwan: YES, I'D
LOVE TO SECOND AND I AGREE, I


[Captioner] 20:17:07
THINK THIS IS A GREAT TIMELY
TOPIC AND WE NEED TO ADDRESS
THIS, SO I LOOK FORWARD TO THE


[Captioner] 20:17:12
FEEDBACK FROM OUR STAFF.
SO I SECOND THAT.
>> Mayor Mei: SURE.


[Captioner] 20:17:18
>> Councilmember Keng: CAN I PUT
IN A QUICK COMMENT?
I DO UNDERSTAND THAT WE NEED TO


[Captioner] 20:17:26
LOOK AT THE ROOT CAUSES AND FIND
SOME OF THE SOLUTIONS, AND I DO
AGREE WITH SOME OF THE CALLERS


[Captioner] 20:17:34
ABOUT INCREASING TRASH
COLLECTION SERVICES, ESPECIALLY
ONE OF MY TOP CONCERNS IS IN THE


[Captioner] 20:17:44
ALBRAE STREET AREA, WHERE WHEN
WE DON'T PROVIDE THOSE TRASH
COLLECTION SERVICES, THEN THOSE


[Captioner] 20:17:52
TRASH CAN PILE UP AFTER MONTHS
AND IT WOULD CAUSE THOUSANDS OF
DOLLARS IN LABOR, SO I THINK IT


[Captioner] 20:18:03
MAY BE MORE COST-EFFECTIVE FOR
US TO PUT IN THOSE TRASH
COLLECTING SERVICES, AND I ALSO


[Captioner] 20:18:12
WANT TO COMMENT ABOUT NOT JUST
LOOKING AT THE BAY AREA CITIES,
BUT IN OTHER CITIES SUCH AS SOME


[Captioner] 20:18:18
OF THE EUROPEAN CITIES, HOW THEY
PROVIDE FOR HOUSING, FOR LOW
INCOME HOUSING FOR THE MEMBERS


[Captioner] 20:18:26
OF THE SOCIETY, I THINK I READ
SOMETHING LIKE IN THE CITY OF 
YANOW, THEY HAVE UP TO 10 TO 15%


[Captioner] 20:18:32
OF THE RESIDENTS RECEIVING SOME
KIND OF SUBSIDIZED HOUSING FROM
GOVERNMENT, SO THEY ARE ABLE TO


[Captioner] 20:18:39
KEEP EVERYONE HOUSED AND 
SHELTERED WITHOUT HAVING TO STAY
IN RVs OR TENTING IN PUBLIC


[Captioner] 20:18:49
STREETS OR PARKS, WHICH IS A
PUBLIC HEALTH HAZARD AND IT
WOULD PREVENT OUR CITY BEING


[Captioner] 20:18:57
ABLE TO ATTRACT MORE BUSINESSES
OR HAVING JUST BEING A NICE
PLACE TO VISIT.


[Captioner] 20:19:04
SO I THINK WE COULD LOOK AT
THOSE CITIES AS WELL.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:19:08
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
COUNCILMEMBER COX, THEN I'LL
MAKE SOME COMMENTS AFTERWARDS.


[Captioner] 20:19:14
>> Councilmember Cox: THANK YOU.
WITH YOUR RECOMMENDATION, I
WOULD LIKE TO SEE IT NARROWED


[Captioner] 20:19:21
DOWN JUST A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE
IT'S A VERY BROAD STATEMENT IN
ADDRESSING THE HEALTH HAZARD.


[Captioner] 20:19:28
I THINK ALL OF US CAN AGREE WE
WANT TO LIVE IN A SAFE
ENVIRONMENT HERE AT THE CITY.


[Captioner] 20:19:36
WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT HEALTH
HAZARD OF ILLEGAL DUMPING, KIND
OF UNDERSTANDING HOW ARE WE


[Captioner] 20:19:42
ADDRESSING IT RIGHT NOW IN TERMS
OF THERE ARE CONTRACTS THAT I
REMEMBER READING IN PREVIOUS


[Captioner] 20:19:48
CITY COUNCIL MEETINGS REGARDING
HOW WE WERE DEALING WITH THE
HOMELESS CLEAN-UP, AND


[Captioner] 20:19:54
UNDERSTANDING THAT PIECE,
BECAUSE WE HAD TO ADD MONEY, I
THINK WE WERE UP TO CLOSE TO


[Captioner] 20:20:01
$600,000, AND IT WASN'T A
REGULAR SERVICE, IT WAS LIKE
ONCE OR TWICE A WEEK THAT THAT


[Captioner] 20:20:10
WAS BEING DEALT WITH.
AND YOU KNOW, IN TERMS OF ALSO
LIKE ARE WE RE-SURVEYING THE


[Captioner] 20:20:15
LANDS, ARE WE LOOKING AROUND AND
SAYING OKAY, IF WE HAVE ALBRAE,
HOW ARE WE GOING TO TACKLE THE


[Captioner] 20:20:24
ALBRAE SITUATION THAT'S AROUND
THE FREEWAY WITH LOVE AND CARE,
AND DISCRETION, BECAUSE OF THOSE


[Captioner] 20:20:31
THAT ARE THERE, AND LOOKING ALSO
IN TERMS OF IF YOU LOOK AT
84 AND NILES CANYON, HOW WE'RE


[Captioner] 20:20:37
GOING TO CLEAN THOSE THINGS UP,
AND JUST KIND OF -- I WOULD LIKE
TO SEE A LITTLE BIT MORE OF NOT


[Captioner] 20:20:47
NECESSARILY A GENERAL STATEMENT
BUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT
CLEAN-UP IN CERTAIN AREAS, AND


[Captioner] 20:20:53
HOW TO ADDRESS IT, BECAUSE IF WE
HAVE A CONTRACT ALREADY THAT'S
IN PERFORMANCE, THEN


[Captioner] 20:20:59
UNDERSTANDING WHERE ARE THE GAPS
IN THE CURRENT CONTRACT TO HOW
TO ADDRESS THAT PART.


[Captioner] 20:21:07
THE OTHER PART IS, IF YOU'RE
GOING TO LOOK AT SOME OTHER
BROADER SPECTRUM OF HOUSING 


[Captioner] 20:21:14
LIVING RESIDENTS AND HOW TO GET
THOSE THAT ARE IN OTHER LIVING
ARRANGEMENTS INTO MORE PERMANENT


[Captioner] 20:21:20
HOUSING WITH LOVE AND CARE, HOW
WE'RE GOING TO DEAL WITH THAT
PART.


[Captioner] 20:21:27
SO THE ADDRESSING HEALTH HAZARD
ILLEGAL DUMPING AND CLEAN-UP,
THAT'S ONE PART, BUT TRYING TO


[Captioner] 20:21:32
UNDERSTAND HOW WE GET FROM THERE
TO HOUSING IS ANOTHER BIGGER
STEP THAT REQUIRES A LOT MORE


[Captioner] 20:21:36
FUNDING.
GRANTED THAT I KNOW WE ARE GOING
THROUGH KEEPING OUR FINGERS


[Captioner] 20:21:43
CROSSED ON THE THIRD ROUND FOR
THE HOMEKEY PROJECT, BUT JUST
TRYING TO TACKLE A LITTLE BIT AT


[Captioner] 20:21:48
EACH AREA BECAUSE I THINK FROM
WHAT I'M HEARING FROM
CONSTITUENTS, THEY DRIVE AND


[Captioner] 20:21:53
THEY'RE NOT SEEING THINGS
GETTING CLEANED UP, THEY SEE
THINGS GETTING OUT OF HAND.


[Captioner] 20:22:00
AND NOT BEING, I GUESS, DEALT
WITH IN A MANNER.
I HAVE SCHOOLS THAT HAVE CALLED


[Captioner] 20:22:06
ME THAT HAVE HOMELESS 
ENCAMPMENTS THAT ONLY BECAUSE
THEY HAVE TO CLEAN IT UP BECAUSE


[Captioner] 20:22:14
IT'S A CHILD ENDANGERMENT THAT
THAT SETS THE PRIORITY, BUT WHAT
ABOUT ALL THESE OTHER AREAS THAT


[Captioner] 20:22:18
WE HAVE AROUND THAT?
WE STILL HAVE STUDENTS THAT ARE
WORKING THROUGH AREAS THAT ARE


[Captioner] 20:22:24
NOT AS SAFE TO WALK TO GET TO
SCHOOL, BUT ALSO JUST ALL OF US
THAT ARE LIVING HERE AS


[Captioner] 20:22:33
RESIDENTS, HOW WE'RE GOING TO
DEAL WITH EACH STREET AND HAVING
A PLAN OF ATTACK ON HOW TO TEAL


[Captioner] 20:22:37
WITH THAT PART.
SO I'M KIND OF A LITTLE LOST IN
TERMS OF WHEN EUROPE TALKING


[Captioner] 20:22:43
MUNICIPAL OPTIONS AND PRACTICES,
WHAT ARE YOU SPECIFICALLY
WANTING TO TARGET?


[Captioner] 20:22:49
YOU WANT TO TARGET FIRST THE
DUMPING AND THE CLEANING PART OF
THAT, AND THEN FALL INTO SOME


[Captioner] 20:22:58
OTHER AREAS, YOU KNOW, TO KIND
OF GET THAT UNDER SOME SORT OF
PERFORMANCE OR MILESTONE CHART,


[Captioner] 20:23:03
BUT IT'S JUST TRYING TO
UNDERSTAND FROM ADDRESSING IT,
WE'VE GOT TO LOOK AT WHAT WE


[Captioner] 20:23:08
HAVE RIGHT NOW, AND HOW MUCH
IT'S COSTING US AS A CITY BEFORE
WE START LOOKING AT SOME OTHER


[Captioner] 20:23:14
THINGS BECAUSE IF IT'S A
PERFORMANCE WITH OUR SUPPLIER OR
VENDOR THAT'S PERFORMING IT,


[Captioner] 20:23:22
THAT'S ONE SITUATION.
OR DO WE NEED TO INCREASE IT,
AND A LOT FOR MORE MONEY THAT


[Captioner] 20:23:25
WILL HAVE TO BE VOTED ON IN
TERMS OF ALLOCATING MORE MONEY
TO DO THAT PART.


[Captioner] 20:23:32
SO I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND
THE WHOLE PRINCIPLE OF WRAPPING
AROUND WHAT HAVE WE GOT GOING


[Captioner] 20:23:36
RIGHT NOW IN TERMS OF THIS
CLEAN-UP.
BECAUSE I DON'T THINK IT BEEN


[Captioner] 20:23:41
PROPERLY ADDRESSED IN ANY OF OUR
OTHER COUNCIL MEETINGS OTHER
THAN TO APPROVE ADDITIONAL


[Captioner] 20:23:46
FUNDING ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO.
>> Mayor Mei: COUNCILMEMBER
JONES, DID YOU WANT TO ADD


[Captioner] 20:23:48
SOMETHING?
>> Councilmember Jones: THANK
YOU, MADAME MAYOR.


[Captioner] 20:23:55
SO MY ORIGINAL COMMENTS STAND.
THIS WAS REALLY NOT THE PLACE TO
HAVE THIS DISCUSSION, IT'S MORE


[Captioner] 20:24:00
TO FIND OUT WHAT STAFF COMES
BACK WITH AND THE
RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING THE


[Captioner] 20:24:05
FISCAL ABILITY AND THE STAFFING
ABILITY, AND MY MOTION STANDS
AND I HAD A SECOND AND I WOULD


[Captioner] 20:24:08
LIKE TO CALL FOR A VOTE, PLEASE.
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY.
I'D LIKE TO CALL FOR THE VOTE


[Captioner] 20:24:12
TOO.
OH, SORRY.
THE ONLY PERSON THAT DIDN'T GET


[Captioner] 20:24:16
TO SPEAK WAS COUNCILMEMBER SHAO.
I APOLOGIZE.
>> Councilmember Shao: THANK


[Captioner] 20:24:22
YOU, MADAME MAYOR.
I JUST WANT TO ADD THAT THIS IS
ALSO A TIMELY REFERRAL BECAUSE


[Captioner] 20:24:29
IN FRONT OF THE HOMELESSNESS, NO
BAY AREA CITY IS SPARED.
WE SHARE THE SAME CHALLENGE AND


[Captioner] 20:24:39
CERTAINLY WE CAN SHARE THE SAME
SOLUTIONS, AND AS THE MAYOR
ALWAYS SAYS WE'RE NOT SHY TO


[Captioner] 20:24:45
RINSE, WASH AND RE-USE.
SO WE CAN CERTAINLY LEARN FROM
NEIGHBORING CITIES IN VERY


[Captioner] 20:24:53
FOCUSED AREA HERE, AS IT SAYS IN
THE REFERRAL, THE ILLEGAL 
DUMPING AND RELATED CLEANUP.


[Captioner] 20:24:59
SO I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE VERY
USEFUL.
I WONDER, THE OPTIONS AND


[Captioner] 20:25:10
PRACTICES WOULD ALSO INCLUDE
SOSA FUNDS, IF SO, THEY'LL BE
VERY POWERFUL SO THAT NOT ONLY


[Captioner] 20:25:19
WE WILL TRY TO FIND THE BEST
APPROACH TO ADDRESS, BUT ALSO
THE POSSIBLE FUNDING RESOURCES,


[Captioner] 20:25:29
AND THAT CERTAINLY WILL BE
BENEFICIAL.
AND I ECHO COUNCILMEMBER JONES'


[Captioner] 20:25:37
COMMENTS REGARDING THE DETAILS.
I THINK THIS IS NOT THE TIME TO
EXPAND THE SCOPE OR GET INTO THE


[Captioner] 20:25:46
DETAILS.
RATHER, WE CAN JUST TAKE A STEP
AT A TIME AND I REALLY WOULD


[Captioner] 20:25:51
APPRECIATE IF WE CAN COME UP
WITH SOME FOLLOW-UP FOR THE
REFERRAL.


[Captioner] 20:25:59
>> Mayor Mei: SO SPEAKING OF
FOLLOW-UP, ONE THE THINGS WE
WANT TO NARROW DOWN AND I DIRECT


[Captioner] 20:26:02
TO STAFF, SOME OF THE SPEAKERS
HAVE COMMENTED EARLIER THIS
EVENING, IS THERE A TIME FRAME


[Captioner] 20:26:08
WE CAN DO THIS.
I WANT TO CLARIFY TO THE PUBLIC
THAT ALL TIMES WE ARE LOOKING


[Captioner] 20:26:16
FOR FUNDING, SO EVEN FOR THE
HOMELESS NAVIGATION CENTER IN
JUNE, AB178, WE SECURED ANOTHER


[Captioner] 20:26:19
500,000, HALF A MILLION,
SPECIFICALLY FOR A HOUSING
NAVIGATION CENTER.


[Captioner] 20:26:22
SO WE ARE CONSTANTLY LOOKING AT
THE PROGRAMS AND HOW WE CAN
SECURE FUNDING.


[Captioner] 20:26:26
SO WHAT WOULD BE A TIME FRAME
THAT YOU THINK WOULD BE A
REASONABLE TIME FRAME TO LOOK


[Captioner] 20:26:31
BACK AND BE ABLE TO REPORT OUT
ON THIS?
I THINK CITY MANAGER 


[Captioner] 20:26:35
SHACKELFORD, YOU AND I HAVE 
TALKED ABOUT THIS A LITTLE.
>> City Mgr. Shackelford: RIGHT.


[Captioner] 20:26:40
I'M HAPPY TO RESPOND TO THAT,
AND THERE ARE A FEW OTHER THINGS
THAT I'LL SHARE WITH YOU ALL AS


[Captioner] 20:26:46
WELL.
WITH REGARD TO THE TIMELINE FOR
THIS, STAFF ALREADY HAS PLANS TO


[Captioner] 20:26:54
COME TO COUNCIL THIS FALL WITH
COMPREHENSIVE UPDATE ON OUR
EFFORTS TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS.


[Captioner] 20:27:01
ONE OF THE PRIORITIES YOU ALL
ESTABLISHED EARLIER THIS YEAR.
SO THERE'S NOT A DEPARTMENT IN


[Captioner] 20:27:07
THIS CITY THAT HAS NOT TOUCHED
HOMELESSNESS OR BEEN INVOLVED IN
IT IN SOME SORT OF WAY.


[Captioner] 20:27:14
SO IT IS VERY MUCH A PRIORITY
FOR US AS WELL.
IN RESPONSE TO SOME OF THE


[Captioner] 20:27:20
COMMENTS FROM THE CALLERS, I
INVITE EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU
TO VISIT OUR CITY WEBSITE, SIGN


[Captioner] 20:27:26
UP FOR OUR VARIOUS CITY
NEWSLETTERS, FOR INFORMATION
THAT IS CONSTANTLY BEING UPDATED


[Captioner] 20:27:35
ON THIS MATTER AND OTHER THINGS
THAT ARE OCCURRING IN THE CITY.
WITH REGARD TO THE CLEAN-UPS, SO


[Captioner] 20:27:44
LAST FISCAL YEAR, 21-22, WE
SPENT OVER 2,000 CONTRACTOR
HOURS, PICKED UP 325 TONS OF


[Captioner] 20:27:55
DEBRIS, REMOVED SEVEN RVs AND
TWO TRUCK CAMPERS, SO DISMANTLED
THEM, REMOVED THEM.


[Captioner] 20:28:01
THERE WERE 98 CLEAN-UP EVENTS.
SO THE LIST GOES ON AND ON, SO
WE'RE CONSTANTLY RESPONDING TO


[Captioner] 20:28:11
THIS, CONSTANTLY AMENDING THE
CONTRACT SO THE CONTRACTOR CAN
DO MORE, BUT AS COUNCILMEMBER


[Captioner] 20:28:16
SHAO JUST MENTIONED, THERE'S NOT
A CITY AROUND US THAT ISN'T
IMPACTED BY THIS.


[Captioner] 20:28:23
SO WE CONTINUE TO LOOK FOR
MITIGATION SOLUTIONS, WE
CONTINUE TO OFFER SERVICES TO


[Captioner] 20:28:31
THOSE IN NEED, AND WE CONTINUE
TO PROVIDE HOUSING AS THE CALLER
EARLIER NOTED FROM THE REPORT


[Captioner] 20:28:35
THAT HE FOUND ONLINE.
SO YOU KNOW, THINGS ARE BEING
DONE.


[Captioner] 20:28:42
I WISH THERE WAS, YOU KNOW, I
COULD WAVE A WAND AND SOLVE IT
ALL, BUT, YOU KNOW, LITTLE BY


[Captioner] 20:28:48
LITTLE, STEP BY STEP, BUT AGAIN,
MADAME MAYOR, RESPONSE TO YOUR
QUESTION ABOUT TIMING, WE WILL


[Captioner] 20:28:54
BE BACK THIS FALL WITH A
COMPREHENSIVE REPORT OR UPDATE
ON OUR HOMELESSNESS EFFORTS, AND


[Captioner] 20:28:58
RESPONSE TO YOUR REFERRAL WILL
BE INCLUDED IN THAT IF IT PAS
TONIGHT.


[Captioner] 20:29:01
 PASSES
TONIGHT.
>> Mayor Mei: THAT'S WHAT I WAS


[Captioner] 20:29:06
HOPING FOR, WE HAD TALKED ABOUT
SOMETIME IN OCTOBER.
ALSO WE ACTUALLY JOINED FOR 


[Captioner] 20:29:12
CITIES OF OPPORTUNITIES, AND THE
FOCUS THAT WE FOCUSED ON WAS
HEALTH EQUITY, SO THAT'S ONE


[Captioner] 20:29:17
AREA.
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT MENTAL 
HEALTH, PHYSICAL HEALTH WHICH IS


[Captioner] 20:29:22
A KEY PART FOR OUR DELIVERY, AND
FOR THE BLOOMBERG HARVARD
INSTITUTE, LEADERSHIP INSTITUTE,


[Captioner] 20:29:31
WE FOCUSED ON KIPS, OR KPI, KEY
PERFORMANCE INDEX INDICATORS,
AND THAT'S HOW WE'RE GOING TO BE


[Captioner] 20:29:35
PRIORITIZING SOME OF THIS IN
TERMS OF THE FOCUS.
BECAUSE I AM A PERSON WHO LIKES


[Captioner] 20:29:40
DATA, AND I LIKE TO HAVE THE
ABILITY TO SHOW WHAT'S BEEN
INVESTED AND WHAT'S THE RESULTS.


[Captioner] 20:29:47
AND I HAVE TO THANK SANDY, WHO'S
IN THE AUDIENCE RIGHT NOW, WHO'S
OUR CTO, AS WELL AS LAURIE AND


[Captioner] 20:29:50
SUZANNE AND SO MANY MEMBERS OF
THE TEAM THAT ARE WORKING ON
THIS.


[Captioner] 20:29:57
THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT WE NOTED
AS A COUNCIL PRIORITY, SO THAT'S
WHY I JUST THOUGHT WE'D COME


[Captioner] 20:30:03
BACK AND HAVE A LITTLE MORE
FOCUS ON IT, AND I DON'T THINK
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A MAGIC WAND


[Captioner] 20:30:07
OR SOLUTION TODAY, BUT WHAT I'M
HOPING FOR IS THE STAFF WILL BE
ABLE TO COME BACK AND GIVE A


[Captioner] 20:30:12
DETAILED REPORT, EITHER IN
OCTOBER OR NOVEMBER AT THE
LATEST, BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO


[Captioner] 20:30:16
GO INTO THE HOLIDAY SEASON, BUT
HOPEFULLY BY THEN, WE'LL BE ABLE
TO GIVE A REPORT OUT AND BE ABLE


[Captioner] 20:30:21
TO PROVIDE MORE DIRECTION AND
THE FOCUS.
BUT IN THE INTERIM, I APPRECIATE


[Captioner] 20:30:26
THE CALLER WHO HAD MENTIONED
ALSO THAT WE HAVE A NEW
AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNIT, THERE'S


[Captioner] 20:30:33
BOTH A FLYER OUT THERE AS WELL
AS A LIST, SO FOR THOSE WHETHER
IT'S SENIOR HOUSING OR WE'VE


[Captioner] 20:30:39
ALSO FOCUSED ON FAMILY HOUSING,
AND ALSO DIFFERENT TYPES OF EVEN
VETERAN HOUSING.


[Captioner] 20:30:46
SO THERE ARE DETAILS OF THOSE
PROJECTS AND THE TIME FRAME THAT
THEY'RE COMING IN.


[Captioner] 20:30:50
I KNOW WE'RE NOT BUILDING NEARLY
ENOUGH TO WHAT PEOPLE WOULD LIKE
TO SEE, BUT I WILL WANT TO NOTE


[Captioner] 20:30:55
THAT IN OUR CITY'S LAST SIX
YEARS, WE HAVE BILTMORE
AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND LOW


[Captioner] 20:30:59
INCOME HOUSING THAN WE HAVE EVER
IN OUR CITY'S HISTORY.
AND SO IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE IT


[Captioner] 20:31:03

CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON, AND WE'RE
GOING TO CONTINUE TO STRIVE TO


[Captioner] 20:31:07
MAKE SURE THESE ARE AREAS THAT
WE ADDRESS.
SO WE HAVE A MOTION AND SECOND.


[Captioner] 20:31:11
COUNCILMEMBER KENG, DID YOU WANT
TO ADD?
>> Councilmember Keng: CAN I ADD


[Captioner] 20:31:17
ANOTHER QUICK COMMENT?
I KNOW THAT IN THE REPORT OUT,
IT WILL INCLUDE THE SAFE PARKING


[Captioner] 20:31:23
PROGRAM UPDATE, AND CAN WE 
ALSO -- I KNOW A LOT OF
NEIGHBORS HAD ASKED ABOUT WHAT'S


[Captioner] 20:31:31
THE POSSIBILITY OF HAVING A SAFE
PARKING PROGRAM ON A CITY LAND.
SO I KNOW IT TAKES A LOT OF


[Captioner] 20:31:38
EFFORTS TO DO THAT, SO PERHAPS
WE CAN EXPLORE ANY OPPORTUNITIES
IF THERE'S ANY.


[Captioner] 20:31:43
>> Mayor Mei: WE DEFINITELY 
HAVE --
>> City Mgr. Shackelford: HAVE


[Captioner] 20:31:47
DONE THAT EXPLORATION AND I
BELIEVE REPORTED BACK TO THE
COUNCIL ON IT, SO WE CAN REFRESH


[Captioner] 20:31:53
THAT AND PROVIDE IT AS A 
REMINER, BUT AGAIN, IT WILL BE A
COMPREHENSIVE REPORT, WHICH WILL


[Captioner] 20:31:57
INCLUDE INFORMATION ON ALL OF
OUR EFFORTS AND ACTIVITIES
SURROUNDING HOMELESSNESS.


[Captioner] 20:32:02
>> Mayor Mei: SO WE HAVE A
MOTION AND SECOND.
COULD WE HAVE A VOTE, PLEASE?


[Captioner] 20:32:08
>> Ms. Gauthier: COUNCILMEMBER
COX, AYE.
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN, AYE.


[Captioner] 20:32:14
COUNCILMEMBER SHAO, AYE.
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN IS ABSENT.
COUNCILMEMBER JONES, AYE.


[Captioner] 20:32:19
COUNCILMEMBER KENG, AYE.
MAYOR MEI, AYE.
>> Mayor Mei: SO THE REFERRAL


[Captioner] 20:32:26
PASSES AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO
HAVING THIS REPORT AND WE WILL
DEFINITELY PUBLICIZE IT ON OUR


[Captioner] 20:32:32
WEBSITE AND ALSO IF YOU COULD
SIGN UP IF ANYONE IS INTERESTED
IN SOME OF THESE SPECIFIC AREAS,


[Captioner] 20:32:35
WE ARE TRYING TO HAVE THE
FREMONT CONNECTIONS AS WELL AS
OTHER OPPORTUNITIES SUCH AS THE


[Captioner] 20:32:40
AGE WELL NEWSLETTER AND OTHER
HUMAN SERVICES NEWSLETTERS.
AND I JUST WANTED TO MENTION, I


[Captioner] 20:32:45
THINK IN OUR LATEST HUMAN
SERVICES NEWSLETTER, THERE ALSO
WAS EVEN AN OPTION FOR IF YOU


[Captioner] 20:32:51
NEED CAR REPAIR, WE WANTED TO
HAVE INAP RABL VEHICLES
ADDRESSED, AND THERE IS A GRANT


[Captioner] 20:32:55
THAT WE HAD PARTNERED ON TO
SECURE, SO THAT FOR THE VEHICLES
THAT ARE IN THOSE SITUATIONS,


[Captioner] 20:32:58
THAT THEY'D BE APPLICABLE FOR
THAT AND THEY COULD APPLY FOR
THAT.


[Captioner] 20:33:04
NEXT IS ITEM 8.2, WHICH IS MY
REFERRAL ON APPOINTMENTS TO
ADVISORY BODIES.


[Captioner] 20:33:12
AND SO I'M MAKING SEVERAL
APPOINTMENTS THIS EVENING, AND
THEY ARE TO THE MOBILITY


[Captioner] 20:33:20
COMMISSION FOR MONIQUE CHAPMAN,
THE IMPAIRMENT REPRESENTATIVE.
FOR THE RECREATION COMMISSION,


[Captioner] 20:33:23
ERIK DONATO.
FOR THE YOUTH ADVISORY
COMMISSION, FOUR INDIVIDUALS,


[Captioner] 20:33:30
AND I THANK THE STAFF FOR 
HELPING ME REVIEW THOSE.
THAT IS FOR EMILY TANG, JESSICA


[Captioner] 20:33:37
LI, ADITYA MITTAL, AND SEAN 
DORJE.
>> Ms. Gauthier: YOU HAVE A


[Captioner] 20:33:41
PUBLIC SPEAKER.
>> Mayor Mei: SURE.
>> Ms. Gauthier: CHRIS.


[Captioner] 20:33:52
>> YES.
I WANTED TO SPEAK OUT BECAUSE
THESE REFERRAL APPOINTMENTS,


[Captioner] 20:33:57
THEY WERE RECOMMENDATIONS GIVEN
BY THE CITY COUNCILMEMBERS TO
THE MAYOR ON HOW THEY'D LIKE TO


[Captioner] 20:34:00
SEE THESE RECOMMENDATIONS AND
I'M NOT SURE THEY'VE BEEN 
FOLLOWED HERE.


[Captioner] 20:34:08
AT THE SAME TIME, I THINK THE
CITY COUNCIL FORGETS THAT
CITIZENS HAVE THE RIGHT TO


[Captioner] 20:34:14
REDRESS THEIR GOVERNMENT AS THEY
SEE FIT, SO IF THEY WANT TO GO
ON A TANGENT BEFORE THEY GO TO


[Captioner] 20:34:21
THE MEAT OF THEIR QUESTION, I
THINK THE CITY COUNCIL SHOULD
ALLOW THEM TO DO THAT, AS IT IS


[Captioner] 20:34:28
THEIR RIGHT.
IT IS LEGALLY ABLE TO GO TO A
CITY COUNCIL UNDER THE BROWN ACT


[Captioner] 20:34:32
AND SPEAK OVER THE CITY MEMBERS
IF ENOUGH PEOPLE FEEL THAT IT'S
INCORRECT.


[Captioner] 20:34:39
AND TO TELL SOMEONE LIKE SHARON
THAT SHE CAN'T CONTINUE TALKING
BECAUSE YOU DON'T THINK SHE'S ON


[Captioner] 20:34:45
SUBJECT WITHIN THE FIRST
30 SECONDS OF WHAT SHE'S SAYING,
I THINK IS REALLY UNFAIR.


[Captioner] 20:34:53
BECAUSE GOING BACK TO THESE
APPOINTMENTS TO THE ADVISORY
BOARD, THERE WAS A REQUEST TO


[Captioner] 20:34:59
SEE A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHO WAS
NEW AND SOME PEOPLE NOT?
WHY DO SOME HAVE A 2020 DATE AND


[Captioner] 20:35:04
SOME HAVE A 2023 DATE?
I BELIEVE BECAUSE SOME HAVE
ALREADY BEEN APPOINTED, THERE


[Captioner] 20:35:09
WAS A REQUEST TO GO OVER ALL THE
PEOPLE THAT WERE APPOINTED, I
DON'T SEE THAT BEING DONE.


[Captioner] 20:35:13
I KNOW YOU GUYS MISSED A COUPLE
OF COMMENTS TONIGHT.
THE SIDESHOWS ARE A TERRIBLE


[Captioner] 20:35:17
THING BUT I THINK FREMONT HAS
BIGGER FISH TO FRY FOR OUR
POLICE.


[Captioner] 20:35:25
YOU GUYS WANT A RAISE ACROSS THE
BOARD.
YOU HIRED MARK DANIELS, OKAY,


[Captioner] 20:35:28
WILL I HAVE A CHANCE TO TALK
LATER?
I MEAN, THOSE -- THAT'S WHEN THE


[Captioner] 20:35:33
PERSON WAS STOPPED.
THEY COULD HAVE TIED THAT
TOGETHER TO THE SUBJECT OF


[Captioner] 20:35:39
HOMELESS, WHICH SHE EVENTUALLY
DID, BUT YOU STOPPED HER FROM
TALKING, THINKING THAT, WELL, WE


[Captioner] 20:35:45
CAN JUST SAY IT'S NOT ON 
SUBJECT.
UNFORTUNATELY I THINK YOU GUYS


[Captioner] 20:35:49
SHOULD RECONSIDER THAT.
BECAUSE PEOPLE HAVE THE RIGHT TO
REDRESS THEIR GOVERNMENT AS THEY


[Captioner] 20:35:54
SEE FIT.
THEY CAN TALK ON THE SUBJECT OF
REFERRALS AND THEY CAN ALSO TALK


[Captioner] 20:36:00
ON HOW -- WHY THEY THINK IT'S
BAD YOU GUYS HAVE DONE SUCH A
BAD JOB AND THEN GO TO THE LAW


[Captioner] 20:36:05
THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT OR THE
POINT THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT,
BUT YOU'VE CUT THEM OFF IN


[Captioner] 20:36:12
30 SECONDS AND TELL THEM THAT
THEY'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT IT.
I HAVEN'T SEEN ANY REPORT THAT


[Captioner] 20:36:17
SAYS THESE PEOPLE ARE QUALIFIED,
THESE PEOPLE AREN'T QUALIFIED,
AND WHO IS NEW AND WHO IS NOT


[Captioner] 20:36:25
NEW.
SO I SUGGEST YOU LET PEOPLE
SPEAK AND OTHERWISE, YOU'LL GET


[Captioner] 20:36:31
A MUCH BROADER REDRESS OF 100
PEOPLE IN YOUR MEETING, AND I'M
HAPPY TO PAY THEM TO SHOW UP AND


[Captioner] 20:36:35
TALK ABOUT EVERY SUBJECT I WANT.
THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: WELL, I WANT TO


[Captioner] 20:36:40
CLARIFY THAT THERE IS A PIECE IN
THE BEGINNING OF EVERY MEETING
THAT IS CALLED PUBLIC COMMENTS


[Captioner] 20:36:46
AND THAT IS THE TIME WHICH WE
ALLOW ANYONE TO SPEAK ON AN ITEM
THAT IS NOT AGENDIZED THAT


[Captioner] 20:36:52
EVENING.
AND SO THAT IS THE TIME PERIOD
THAT WE ALWAYS OFFER TO OUR


[Captioner] 20:36:58
PUBLIC, AND FOLLOW THAT
OPPORTUNITY.
REGARDING THE COMMISSIONERS,


[Captioner] 20:37:05
PLEASE NOTE THAT ON OUR CITY'S
WEBSITE, THERE IS A 
COMMISSIONERS PAGE THAT DETAILS


[Captioner] 20:37:10
THE TIME FRAME, THE APPOINTMENTS
AND THE LENGTH OF THE TENURE OF
WHICH THEY'VE BEEN APPOINTED.


[Captioner] 20:37:17
AS FOR THE APPLICATIONS FOR THE
COMMISSIONS THAT ARE BEING 
REFERRED, PLEASE NOTE THAT IF


[Captioner] 20:37:25
YOU LOOK AT THE DETAIL THAT'S IN
THE PACKET THIS EVENING, THEY
WILL SEE THE APPLICATIONS FOR


[Captioner] 20:37:29
THE COMMISSIONERS, BECAUSE THAT
IS PUBLISHED AND RELEASED SO
THAT PEOPLE MAY BE ABLE TO


[Captioner] 20:37:36
REVIEW THOSE.
THAT BEING SAID, AT THIS TIME,
I'D LIKE TO SEE IF THERE IS A


[Captioner] 20:37:39
MOTION OR A SECOND OR ANY
QUESTIONS FOR THIS?
>> Councilmember Jones: I'LL


[Captioner] 20:37:46
MOVE TO APPROVE.
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY.
I DON'T THINK IT GOING TO BE A


[Captioner] 20:37:50
BIG ARGUMENT.
>> Councilmember Cox: BUT IT WAS
DONE EARLIER, BUT -- IT'S NOTED.


[Captioner] 20:37:56
>> Ms. Gauthier: I'M SORRY, I
CAN'T HEAR COUNCILMEMBER COX.
>> Mayor Mei: SHE WAS SAYING SHE


[Captioner] 20:38:02
HAD MADE THE MOTION BEFORE.
I THINK AS WE ARE GOING THROUGH
GROWING PAINS WITH TECHNOLOGY,


[Captioner] 20:38:05
NEXT TIME, I THINK THERE IS A --
THERE SHOULD BE A BUTTON TO MAKE
A MOTION.


[Captioner] 20:38:13
I DON'T KNOW RIGHT NOW -- WE'LL
GO THROUGH -- THERE ISN'T A
BUTTON?


[Captioner] 20:38:18
>> Ms. Gauthier: NO.
I JUST CAN'T HEAR IT OVER HERE,
I CAN'T HEAR.


[Captioner] 20:38:21
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY.
I KNOW USUALLY IN THE PAST,
YOU'VE BEEN MY SOUNDING BOARD TO


[Captioner] 20:38:26
BE ABLE TO VERIFY, SO THANK YOU.
AND I DON'T THINK THERE'S AN
OBJECTION FOR FIRST VERSUS A


[Captioner] 20:38:30
SECOND.
>> Councilmember Jones: I DON'T
CARE WHO MAKES THE MOTION AS


[Captioner] 20:38:35
LONG AS IT MOVES FORWARD.
>> Mayor Mei: SO MOTION BY
COUNCILMEMBER COX AND SECONDED


[Captioner] 20:38:40
BY COUNCILMEMBER JONES.
AND WE'LL FIGURE OUT THIS AS WE
COME BACK TO IN PERSON, BECAUSE


[Captioner] 20:38:44
IT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT,
VERSUS ZOOM.
>> Ms. Gauthier: OKAY.


[Captioner] 20:38:47
>> Mayor Mei: ROLL CALL VOTE,
PLEASE.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:38:49
>> Ms. Gauthier: COUNCILMEMBER
COX, AYE.
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN, AYE.


[Captioner] 20:38:55
COUNCILMEMBER SHAO, AYE.
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN IS ABSENT.
COUNCILMEMBER JONES, AYE.


[Captioner] 20:39:05
VICE MAYOR KENG, AYE.
MAYOR MEI, AYE.
I KNOW WHEN YOU PRESS THE BUTTON


[Captioner] 20:39:10
IT DOES SHOW A QUEUE ON THE
SCREEN, SO WE'LL FIGURE THAT OUT
AS WE MOVE FORWARD.


[Captioner] 20:39:17
I APPRECIATE ALL THE PUBLIC
COMMENTS AND THOSE WHO WANT TO
ATTEND THE MEETING, AND I


[Captioner] 20:39:21
ENCOURAGE PEOPLE IF THEY'RE
INTERESTED IN LEARNING MORE TO
SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERS AND


[Captioner] 20:39:26
OUR AGENDA AND THE COMMENTS THAT
WERE GIVEN TO US, BOTH THOSE
VERBALLY AS WELL AS THOSE THAT


[Captioner] 20:39:34
WERE EMAILED TO US, AND I KNOW 
KATHERINE HAD SAID THAT TO US,
THEY ARE DOCUMENTED AND RECORDED


[Captioner] 20:39:39
FOR OUR CITY CLERK AND PUT ON
FILE FOR RECORD.
THAT BEING SAID, I'D LIKE TO


[Captioner] 20:39:43
ADJOURN THE MEETING THIS 
EVENING, AND THANK YOU ALL FOR
YOUR TIME.
