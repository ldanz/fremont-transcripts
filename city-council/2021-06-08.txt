NEXT ARE CEREMONIAL ITEMS.

19:09:03 WE'LL BE RECOGNIZING FOR THIS MONTH OF JUNE ELDER ABUSE AWARENESS MONTH, AND I'M GOING TO READ A RESOLUTION ON 
19:09:12 THAT, AND I THINK WE HAVE OUR ALAMEDA COUNTY DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY CHERYL PONCINI WHO'S GOING TO BE RECEIVING 
19:09:26 THIS ON BEHALF OF THE COUNTY.
 WHEREAS, VICTIMS OF ELDER ABUSE INCLUDE BOTH MEN AND WOMEN OF DIVERSE 
19:09:30 EDUCATIONAL, SOCIO-ECONOMIC OR ETHNIC BACKGROUNDS WHO HAVE BEEN VICTIMIZED BY STRANGERS AND/OR BY PERSONS THEY 
19:09:34 KNOW WHO MAY OCCUPY A POSITION OF TRUST INCLUDING FAMILY MEMBERS, NEIGHBORS, FRIENDS AND OTHERS WITH WHOM THE ELDER 
19:09:47 INTERACTS; AND WHEREAS, OVER A YEAR AFTER THE 2020 CORONAVIRUS COVID-19 PANDEMIC BEGAN IN THE UNITED STATES, 
19:09:50 IT CONTINUES TO IMPACT EVERYONE, ESPECIALLY ELDERS, BY MAKING FRAGILE LIVING SITUATIONS MORE STRESSFUL, 
19:09:56 THEREBY PUTTING ELDERS MORE AT RISK FOR THEIR PHYSICAL SAFETY AND WELL-BEING, MAKING THE REPORTING OF SUSPECTED 
19:10:06 ELDER ABUSE, NEGLECT AND FINANCIAL EXPLOITATION MORE DIFFICULT, AS WELL AS GIVING THOSE WHO COMMIT SCAMS AN 
19:10:12 OPPORTUNITY TO MORPH EXISTING SCAMS, AND CREATE NEW SCAMS, TO PREY UPON THE CONCERNS AND FEARS OF VULNERABLE 
19:10:24 MEMBERS OF SOCIETY IN ORDER TO OBTAIN THEIR MONEY AND PROPERTY; AND WHEREAS, THE ALAMEDA COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY’S 
19:10:27 OFFICE, ITS ELDER PROTECTION UNIT AND ITS VICTIM WITNESS DIVISION PROVIDE A NETWORK OF SERVICES TO ELDERS WHO ARE 
19:10:37 IN DANGER OF BECOMING, OR WHO HAVE BECOME, VICTIMS OF ABUSE, NEGLECT OR FINANCIAL EXPLOITATION AND WHICH 
19:10:46 SERVICES INCLUDE HOLDING COMMUNITY WORKSHOPS TO PROMOTE CRIME PREVENTION AWARENESS, ASSISTING WITH LOCATING 
19:10:50 SERVICES FOR ELDERS, WORKING WITH THE FREMONT POLICE DEPARTMENT AS WELL AS WITH OTHER PROFESSIONALS, AND 
19:10:56 PROSECUTING CASES OF ELDER ABUSE, NEGLECT AND FINANCIAL EXPLOITATION; AND WHEREAS, THE ALAMEDA COUNTY SOCIAL 
19:11:07 SERVICES AGENCY, ADULT PROTECTIVE SERVICES & THE OMBUDSMAN SERVICES OF ALAMEDA, CONTRA COSTA & SOLANO 
19:11:11 COUNTIES RESPOND TO REPORTS FROM INDIVIDUALS, CONCERNED CITIZENS, SOCIAL SERVICE AND HEALTH PROVIDERS, 
19:11:17 AND LAW ENFORCEMENT REPRESENTATIVES ABOUT ELDERS WHO MAY BE PHYSICALLY OR FINANCIALLY ABUSED, NEGLECTED OR 
19:11:23 EXPLOITED; AND WHEREAS, THE FREMONT SENIOR CENTER PROVIDES A COMPREHENSIVE ARRAY OF SERVICES, AS WELL AS SOCIAL 
19:11:30 AND RECREATIONAL PROGRAMS TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE ELDER POPULATION, THEREBY ENHANCING THEIR QUALITY OF LIFE AND 
19:11:37 HELPING THEM TO REMAIN ACTIVE, HEALTHY, SAFE AND INDEPENDENT; AND WHEREAS, THE CITY OF FREMONT RECOGNIZES THAT BOTH 
19:11:45 THE AWARENESS OF ELDER ABUSE, NEGLECT AND FINANCIAL EXPLOITATION AS WELL AS REPORTING INSTANCES OF SUSPECTED ELDER 
19:11:52 ABUSE, NEGLECT AND FINANCIAL EXPLOITATION, PARTICULARLY IN THIS ONGOING STRESSFUL TIME OF A GLOBAL 
19:12:00 PANDEMIC, WILL HELP KEEP OUR ELDERS AND COMMUNITY SAFER. NOW, THEREFORE, THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF FREMONT 
19:12:10 HEREBY PROCLAIMS JUNE 2021 AS “ELDER ABUSE AWARENESS MONTH” IN THE CITY OF FREMONT, IN RECOGNITION OF ELDERS 
19:12:22 BEING VALUABLE MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY AND HAVING THE RIGHT TO LIVE SAFELY AND SECURITY IN OUR COMMUNITY.

19:12:27 SO THANK YOU SO MUCH, CHERYL, FOR JOINING US THIS EVENING AND FOR TAKING ON THIS IMPORTANT CAUSE, MORE 
19:12:35 IMPORTANT NOW THAN EVER.
>> ABSOLUTELY, MAYOR.
THANK YOU SO MUCH TO YOU, MADAME 
19:12:45 MAYOR, TO THE CITY COUNCIL, TO STAFF AND TO THE RESIDENTS OF FREMONT FOR ONCE AGAIN RECOGNIZING JUNE AS ELDER 
19:12:52 ABUSE AWARENESS MONTH, AND ON BEHALF OF D.A. NANCY O'MALLEY AND MY OFFICE, I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR DOING THAT.

19:12:58 AS THE PROCLAMATION INDICATES, THIS CONTINUES TO BE A VERY CHALLENGING AND STRESSFUL TIME IN OUR COMMUNITY, OUR 
19:13:10 STATE, OUR COUNTRY AND THE WORLD.
NOT ONLY IS COVID-19 AN ONGOING GLOBAL HEALTH AND FINANCIAL ISSUE, BUT ELDER 
19:13:18 ABUSE, NEGLECT AND FINANCIAL EXPLOITATION ALSO CONTINUES TO BE AN ONGOING GLOBAL HEALTH AND FINANCIAL 
19:13:24 ISSUE FOR OUR SENIORS AND OUR COMMUNITY.
KEEPING THE COMMUNITY AWARE OF THIS 
19:13:31 ISSUE, PARTICULARLY IN TIMES LIKE THIS, IS VITAL.
THE REALITY IS THAT ABUSE OF ANY KIND 
19:13:40 SIMPLY DOES NOT STOP BY ITSELF.
IT MAY TAKE A VILLAGE TO RAISE A CHILD, AS HILLARY CLINTON HAS REMINDED 
19:13:46 US, BUT IT TAKES AN ENTIRE COMMUNITY WORKING TOGETHER TO HELP END ABUSE OF ALL KINDS.

19:13:54 BECAUSE THE REALITY IS THAT THE VERY PLACE WHERE SENIORS SHOULD BE SAFE MAY NOT BE A VERY SAFE PLACE.

19:14:03 AN IMPORTANT WAY TO KEEP THE COMMUNITY AWARE OF THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE IS ISSUING PROCLAMATIONS SUCH AS THIS.

19:14:10 TALKING ABOUT THESE ISSUES AND FINDING WAYS TO HELP.
REPORTING SUSPECTED ABUSE TO LAW 
19:14:19 ENFORCEMENT, ADULT PROTECTIVE SERVICES, OR IF THE ELDER IS IN SKILLED NURSING TO THE OMBUDSMAN SERVICES OF ALAMEDA 
19:14:24 COUNTY IS VITAL.
THEN SKILLED INVESTIGATORS CAN EVALUATE THE SITUATION FOR THE BEST 
19:14:31 RESOLUTION.
BECAUSE WHAT IS MOST IMPORTANT IS KEEPING OUR SENIORS SAFE.

19:14:37 SO THANK YOU AGAIN FOR ACKNOWLEDGING THE IMPORTANCE OF ELDER ABUSE AWARENESS.

19:14:46 IT IS ALWAYS A PLEASURE TO BE HERE TO SHARE THIS WITH YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU AGAIN FOR 
19:14:53 TAKING THE TIME TO RAISE AWARENESS OF THIS IMPORTANT CAUSE, AND FOR THE DILIGENCE THAT YOUR DEPARTMENT IN 
19:15:00 CONJUNCTION WITH D.A. O'MALLEY'S COMPLETE STAFF DOES IN TERMS OF PROTECTING THIS VERY IMPORTANT PART OF 
19:15:05 OUR POPULATION, AND PROVIDING THEM THE DIGNITY, RESPECT AND CARE THAT THEY DESERVE.

19:15:10 SO JUST WANTED TO THANK YOU FOR JOINING US THIS EVENING.
>> THANK YOU.

19:15:15 >> Mayor Mei: BE WELL AND BE SAFE.
>> YOU TOO.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:15:22 NEXT IS OUR ORAL COMMUNICATIONS.
AND THOSE ARE ITEMS THAT ARE ANY PERSON WISHING TO SPEAK ON AN ITEM 
19:15:27 THAT'S NOT AGENDIZED THIS EVENING MAY DO SO AT THIS TIME.
AND WE'LL ALLOW THREE MINUTES PER 
19:15:39 SPEAKER.
THE FIRST SPEAKER IS JOHN WEED.
WELCOME.

19:15:49 >> THANK YOU.
YESTERDAY, THE CITY OF FREMONT ZONING ADMINISTRATOR APPROVED A 112-UNIT LOW 
19:15:59 INCOME HOUSING AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECT ON OSGOOD.
THIS IS DENSITY OF 81 UNITS PER ACRE.

19:16:11 IT WAS ON A 1.37-ACRE SITE.
THE ISSUE I HAVE WITH IT, THE TOTAL WAS ONE THE NOTICE, THE ITEM WAS 
19:16:18 POSTED ON THE CITY WEBSITE ON A FRIDAY. THERE WAS A HEARING ON MONDAY AFTERNOON.

19:16:24 THE TOTAL HEARING WAS SOMEWHAT PERFUNCTORY INCLUDING MY COMMENTS TOOK 10 MINUTES AND WAS ADOPTED.

19:16:30 THE ISSUE AND CONCERNS I HAD WERE THAT THE PARKING REQUIREMENTS FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING WERE ALLOWED TO GO 
19:16:42 IN AT LESS THAN -- ONLY ONE HALF PARKING SPACE PER UNIT, 56 SPACES FOR THE 112 UNITS, PLUS 11 SPACES ON THE 
19:16:52 SITE. FOR VISITORS.
THE TRANSIT BASED ON A TOD, BUT THE TRANSIT IS NOT GOING TO BE THERE FOR 
19:16:57 MANY YEARS.
I WOULD SUGGEST THE CITY OF FREMONT OWNS PROPERTY VERY CLOSE TO THIS, JUST 
19:17:06 FOR THE FUTURE BART STATION, SHOULD IT BE  BUILT, AND THAT IN THE INTERIM, THE CITY PROVIDES COMMUNITY PARKING 
19:17:10 THAT WOULD HELP MEET THE NORMAL STANDARDS FOR THE PARKING IN THESE AREAS.

19:17:19 AND ADDRESS IT.
SECOND, OHLONE COLLEGE HAS BEEN LOOKING AT STUDENT HOUSING.

19:17:26 I WOULD ENCOURAGE THE CITY TO PUT IN THEIR HOUSING POLICIES A REQUIREMENT TO COORDINATE WITH OHLONE COLLEGE FOR 
19:17:33 THE STUDENT HOUSING PROGRAMS AT OHLONE.
BEING A DIRECT COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND 
19:17:39  THERE ARE MUTUAL ADVANTAGES TO THAT EFFORT.
THIRD, THE CITY DELETED THE 
19:17:46 REQUIREMENT FOR BALCONIES.
I WOULD SUGGEST THAT BALCONIES, PARTICULARLY IN THIS TYPE DEVELOPMENT, 
19:17:55 ARE TRULY A HEALTH SAFETY ISSUE.
I HAVE KNOWN RESPONSIBLE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED 
19:18:03 THAT WOULD ONLY GO INTO A UNIT THAT HAD A BALCONY BECAUSE THEY WERE SMOKERS, AND THE LACK OF A SMOKING POLICY IN A 
19:18:10 COMPLEX WITH THIS EXTRAORDINARY DENSITY SHOULD BE RECOGNIZED AS A CONCERN AND SOME STEPS TAKEN IN THE OVERALL 
19:18:23 POLICIES OF THE  CITY.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME, AND I HAVE NO INTENTION OF APPEALING THIS PROJECT.

19:18:33 I DID FEEL THAT THOSE POINTS DID NEED TO HAVE SOME CONSIDERATION, AND THAT YOU SHOULD REVIEW WHAT IS GOING TO THE 
19:18:37 ZONING ADMINISTRATOR AND WHAT IS NOT GOING TO PLANNING COMMISSION AND CITY COUNCIL.

19:18:42 THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
NEXT SPEAKER IS CHRIS.

19:18:50 WELCOME, CHRIS.
>> I JUST HAD A FEW POINTS I WANTED TO MAKE.

19:18:57 THE FIRST I WANTED TO START BY REMINDING THE CITY OF FREMONT THAT THEY ENTERED INTO AGREEMENT WITH 
19:19:05 SENATE BILL 178, AND I CANNOT SEE WHERE THEY PLAN TO MEET THAT REQUIREMENT OF THE SENATE BILL WHERE THEY'RE REQUIRED 
19:19:14 TO DO SO IN JUNE OF 2023.
IT IS NOT IN THE BUDGET THAT YOU GUYS HAVE PROPOSED.

19:19:21 SO I THINK YOU GUYS SHOULD LOOK AT THE BUDGET AND WHAT YOU'VE AGREED TO IN THE SENATE BILL BECAUSE THEY DO NOT 
19:19:26 ALIGN.
THE SECOND THING I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT WOULD BE TRANSPARENCY FOR THE 
19:19:32 UPCOMING PROJECTS, CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS.
EVERYONE I WAS INTERESTED IN, I COULD 
19:19:41 FIND NO SUBSTANTIVE ITEMS ON THE WEBSITE, I GOT NO RESPONSE FROM STAFF FROM EMAILS SENT REQUESTING 
19:19:49 INFORMATION ON THE PROJECTS, AND I THINK THE CITY COUNCIL SAYS THEY WANT TRANSPARENCY, SAYS THEY WANT US TO BE 
19:19:56 INVOLVED IN THIS, BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU EXPECT PEOPLE TO GET INVOLVED IF ALL THEY GET TO SEE IS THE COST AND A 
19:20:04  TWO-LINE DESCRIPTION OF WHAT PROJECT IS.
YOU KNOW, YOU CAN'T EVEN TELL WHEN A 
19:20:12 PROJECT CHANGES YEAR FROM YEAR, IT CHANGED OVER $100,000 WHAT IT'S GOING TO COST, AND YET THE DESCRIPTION HAS 
19:20:21 NOT CHANGED.
SO I'VE HEARD EVERYONE SAID THEY WANTED TRANSPARENCY, THEY WANT TO BE 
19:20:26 THERE, BUT WHEN IT COMES TO BUDGETING, I SEE NO PLACE WHERE YOU GUYS TRY TO PROVIDE TRANSPARENCY.

19:20:31 THIS IS THE EXACT SAME ISSUE I BROUGHT UP A YEAR AGO, WHEN YOU HAD THESE MEETINGS.

19:20:41 AND YOU GUYS ALL VOWED THAT YOU WOULD DO BETTER ON HAVING TRANSPARENCY AND INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC.

19:21:01 THE ONES THAT I LOOKED AT WERE PWC 8392, PWC 9006, PWC 9068, PWC 90 -- LET'S REPEAT, SORRY.

19:21:11 AFTER THAT, I GAVE UP BECAUSE IT'S A WASTE OF TIME.
YOU DO GET A FEW HITS ON THE WEBSITE 
19:21:17 BUT THEY ONLY HAVE TO DO WITH NOTES FROM CITY COUNCIL MEETINGS WHERE YOU GUYS ARE MOVING MONEY TO FUND THESE 
19:21:26 CAPITAL PROJECT, NOT ACTUAL  PLANS FOR THE PROJECTS, IN DEPTH DESCRIPTIONS, OR EVEN A STATUS OF THE PROJECT WHERE 
19:21:31 IT IS.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIE.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:21:41 NEXT SPEAKER IS ASISH PATEL.
THIS IS FOR ITEMS ON ORAL COMMUNICATIONS.

19:21:53 >> HELLO.
HI, THIS IS ASHISH.
THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK IN 
19:22:00 THE CITY MEETING.
SO I WANT TO BRING UP A COUPLE OF POINTS REGARDING THE CENTERVILLE 
19:22:06 DEVELOPMENT.
FIRST OF ALL I FEEL -- I'M A RESIDENT FROM LAST FIVE YEARS AND I FEEL THAT 
19:22:17 THE CENTERVILLE AREA IS DEFINITELY -- MOST NEGLECTED AREA IN TERMS OF DEVELOPMENT FROM THE CITY -- IF YOU 
19:22:26 ROAM AROUND THE CENTERVILLE AREA, YOU DEFINITELY WILL SEE OLD -- UNMANAGED STREETS AND ALL THOSE THINGS, PLUS 
19:22:32 GRAFFITI, IT'S BECOMING LIKE A NUISANCE, AND ON TOP OF THAT, MY HOUSE IS RIGHT NEXT TO THE TRAIN TRACKS.

19:22:42 THE TRAIN TRACK ACTIVITY, THE HORN SOUNDS, THE VIBRATIONS, ALL THIS NUISANCE REPEATEDLY ME AND MY 
19:22:51 NEIGHBORS HAVE BEEN REPORTING TO CITY, NO -- THAT THE CITY CANNOT HELP US IN ANY SENSE.

19:23:00 TO BE HONEST, THAT'S NOT SOMETHING I WAS LOOKING UP AT A FREMONT CITY, AND THIS TIME WHEN I SAW CERTAIN ITEMS 
19:23:17 LIKE QUIET ZONE FOR CENTERVILLE AREA OR  DUSTERBERRY, AS PART OF THE INTEGRAL PART OF THE FREMONT CITY AND TO PUT 
19:23:25 SOME MORE PRECISE -- IN BRINGING IT UP IN A DIFFERENT SHAPE COMPARED TO THE DIFFERENT PART OF THE FREMONT CITY.

19:23:34 SPECIFICALLY IN THIS QUIET ZONE, I HOPE THAT IT WON'T BE AGAIN PUSHED BACK INTO THE BACK  BURNER, AND IT IS GIVEN 
19:23:42 A NEW IMPORTANCE BECAUSE IT IS IMPACTING OUR DAILY LIVES.
AND STAYING AT HOME DURING THIS 
19:23:59 PANDEMIC WILL NOT BE -- DURING THE DAY TIME WHEN THE TRAIN ACTIVITY HAPPENS.
THEY NEED BETTER SLEEP AND THAT, AND 
19:24:03 THEIR SLEEP AND EVERYTHING WAS DISRUPTED.
WHEN FREMONT CITY IS GIVING 
19:24:10 PERMISSIONS TO BUILD HOUSING RIGHT NEXT TO THE TRAIN  CORRIDORS IN THAT THEY HAVE TO LOOK AT ALL THESE DIFFERENT 
19:24:18 ASPECTS AND ALSO -- TO HELP US TO RESOLVE ALL THESE ISSUES.
THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY.

19:24:28 I HAVE NOTHING MUCH TO SAY BUT JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT -- PLEASE BE PROPER AND PRECISE ON THIS QUIET ZONE 
19:24:32 CORRIDOR PROJECT, AND DON'T PUSH IT ON A BACK BURNER FURTHER.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:24:42 AT THIS TIME, WE'LL TURN IT BACK TO THE COUNCIL FOR PUBLIC  HEARING ON OUR PROPOSED  2021-2022 OPERATING BUDGET.

19:24:50 AND I BELIEVE DAVID PERSSELIN WILL BE PRESENTING THIS EVENING, AND HE'S -- WELL, WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR 
19:24:53 QUESTIONS.
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE A PRESENTATION THIS EVENING.

19:24:59 I'M SORRY, DIRECTOR PERSSELIN, YOU'RE ON MUTE.
THANK YOU.

19:25:05 >> Mr. Persselin: MADAME MAYOR, WE DON'T HAVE A PRESENTATION THIS EVENING BUT WE'RE AVAILABLE IF THERE ARE 
19:25:08 QUESTIONS.
>> Mayor Mei: SO WE'LL FIRST TURN TO THE COUNCIL TO SEE IF THERE ARE ANY 
19:25:24 QUESTIONS  PERTAINING TO THE BUDGET AS IT STANDS.
OKAY, SEEING NONE, I'LL TURN TO THE 
19:25:31 PUBLIC FOR COMMENTS.
AND I SEE TWO SPEAKERS ON THAT.
WE'LL CALL THE FIRST SPEAKER, WHICH IS 
19:25:37 CHRIS, AND THE SECOND ONE, WHICH IS KATHY KIMBERLIN.
THANK YOU.

19:25:45 >> SO I HAD A QUESTION SPECIFIC TO CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT OF  PEWC --
>> Mayor Mei: I'M SORRY, SIR, THAT'S 
19:25:51 ACTUALLY THE NEXT AGENDA ITEM.
SO I WILL CALL YOU AT THAT TIME THEN.
>> I APOLOGIZE.

19:25:55 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
CHRIS, WE'LL CALL YOU AT THE NEXT AGENDA ITEM.

19:26:02 KATHY KIMBERLIN, SPEAKING ON TONIGHT'S BUDGET PROPOSED OPERATING --
>> YES, THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME IN.

19:26:09 THIS IS KATHY KIMBERLIN.
I AM A RESIDENT OF THE CENTERVILLE DISTRICT AND I'M HOPING YOU CAN ALL 
19:26:14 HEAR ME VERY WELL, CORRECT?
>> Mayor Mei: YES.
>> THANK YOU.

19:26:21 I HAVE TWO THINGS ABOUT THE BUDGET.
ONE WAS A SUGGESTION OF  EARMARKING FUNDS FOR SHARING INFORMATION ON 
19:26:27 PROJECTS, ESPECIALLY LARGE PROJECTS THAT EFFECT FOLKS CITYWIDE SUCH AS SOME OF THE VISION ZERO  PROJECTS, 
19:26:30 WHICH I DO LIKE.
A LOT OF PEOPLE I'M HEARING DO NOT LIKE.

19:26:38 IF YOU LOOK AT NEXT DOOR, THERE'S SOME CONFUSION AND SOME DISLINE, SO BASICALLY I'M THINKING SOME SOCIAL 
19:26:46 MEDIA OR MARKETING FUNDS THAT HELP EXPLAIN THE BACKGROUND, THE VISION, THE PURPOSE, AND SOME DETAILS TO HELP 
19:26:50 FOLKS UNDERSTAND GIVEN THE HEADS UP AND THEN POINT THEM TO RESOURCES FOR MORE INFORMATION.

19:27:01 ANY WAY WE CAN TO THAT, WE'D BE HAPPY TO HELP ANY WAY WE CAN.
I TRY TO GET THESE THINGS ON FACEBOOK, 
19:27:06 THEN THE SECOND POINT ABOUT THE BUDGET WAS ABOUT THE SPECIAL EVENTS SPONSORSHIP PROGRAM.

19:27:11 FIRST OF ALL I'M SUPER HAPPY TO SEE THAT ON THERE.
IT'S STILL ON THE PLATE FROM A COUPLE 
19:27:18 PRE-PANDEMIC DAYS, BUT SOMETHING THAT REALLY AFFECTS A COUPLE OF THE EVENTS, ONE BEING THE FREMONT FOURTH OF JULY 
19:27:25 PARADE, BEING THAT THAT'S ON JULY 4TH RIGHT AFTER THE FISCAL YEAR STARTS, IT'S REALLY HARD TO APPLY FOR 
19:27:31 SOMETHING RIGHT BEFORE THE EVENT STARTS NOT KNOWING IF THE FUNDING IS GOING TO COME.

19:27:41 SO I WONDER IF THERE'S A WAY TO DO SOME KIND OF CREATIVE  18-MONTH WINDOW WHICH I KNOW GOES INTO DIFFERENT 
19:27:47 FISCAL  YEARS, BUT IF THERE'S SOMETHING THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO APPLY EARLIER AND KNOW SOONER BECAUSE WE HAVE QUITE 
19:27:55 A LARGE BUDGET LINE ITEM TO PAY FOR CITY SERVICES, AND SO FOR US TO KNOW THAT AHEAD OF TIME WOULD HELP US BE 
19:28:03 BETTER PLANNING FOR THE FOURTH OF JULY COMMITTEE THAT I'M ON, A BEAUTIFUL PROJECT FOR THE CITY FOLKS AND THERE 
19:28:09 ARE PROBABLY ANOTHER ONE OR TWO EVENTS LIKE THE FREMONT FESTIVAL OF THE ARTS THAT COMES PRETTY MUCH INTO THE 
19:28:19 BEGINNING OF THE FISCAL YEAR.
SO IF WE COULD LOOK AT SOME WAY TO ALLOW THE EVENTS THAT COME RIGHT AFTER 
19:28:23 THE FISCAL WINDOW STARTING TO HAVE A BIGGER OR EARLIER WINDOW, THAT WOULD BE VERY MUCH APPRECIATED.

19:28:28 AND I CAN TALK TO FOLKS ON ANOTHER TIME IF WE WANT TO BRAINSTORM IDEAS OR COME UP WITH SOMETHING THAT WILL WORK.

19:28:36 THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
I STILL SEE THE HAND RAISED AGAIN FOR 
19:28:39 CHRIS.
IS THAT FOR THE NEXT ITEM?
TO CLARIFY?

19:28:45 OKAY.
KELLY ABREU, ARE YOU COMMENTING ON THE BUDGET?

19:28:56 >> YES.
ON THE FORECAST FOR FUTURE REVENUES, LAST YEAR IT WAS SET AT 7% PER YEAR 
19:29:01 PROPERTY TAX REVENUE GROWTH.
THAT'S THE LARGEST AND MOST IMPORTANT ITEM IN THAT FORECAST.

19:29:11 THIS YEAR IT'S DOWN TO 4.5% COMPOUND ANNUAL GROWTH RATE ON THAT.
BUT THERE'S NO DISCUSSION OF THAT IN 
19:29:18 THE BUDGET DOCUMENTS.
THEY JUST TALK ABOUT NEXT YEAR'S FORECAST, THEY DON'T EXPLAIN THE 
19:29:25 LONG-RANGE FORECAST.
THEY DON'T EXPLAIN THIS CHANGE, IT'S ACTUALLY A SEISMIC SHIFT.

19:29:40 AND IT'S A WELCOME SHIFT BECAUSE IT DOES BRING THE BUDGET BACK INTO SOME RESEMBLANCE TO REALITY AND AWAY FROM 
19:29:45 OVERT EXUBERANCE AND IT WILL BE NICE TO KEEP IT THAT WAY.
THANK YOU.

19:30:04 >> Mayor Mei: SEEING NONE, I JUST WANTED TO NOTE THAT I APPRECIATE ON THE PREVIOUS CONSENT CALENDAR, WE ALSO 
19:30:13 HAD AN ITEM THAT TALKED ABOUT OUR AUDIT AND REVIEW, SO I APPRECIATE THAT FROM THE PERSPECTIVE AND WORKING WITH OUR 
19:30:21 TEAM, AND I SAW DAVE IS NO LONGER -- CAN'T SEE HIM ANYMORE, BUT DIRECTOR PERSSELIN AND HIS TEAM, I WANT TO 
19:30:29 THANK OUR ABILITY TO BE FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE.
I WAS GOING TO MAKE A PROPERTY TAX, I 
19:30:35 REMEMBER MY CONVERSATION LAST YEAR, WAS PERTAINING TO THE FACT THAT THEY WERE BASED OFF OF THE PREVIOUS YEAR, AND SO 
19:30:41 AT THAT POINT, BECAUSE IT WAS  PRE-COVID WHEN IT WAS  CALCULATED, WE WERE HOPING TO NOT SEE AS MUCH OF THE 
19:30:48 IMPACT, BUT THIS YEAR WE ARE DOING A  BETTER TRUE-UP BECAUSE OF WHAT WE'VE SEEN, THOUGH I THINK THE MARKET RATE 
19:30:57 STILL SEEMS TO BE FAIRLY STRONG HERE IN FREMONT.
ANY COMMENTS ON THAT, DIRECTOR 
19:31:00 PERSSELIN?
>> Mr. Persselin: MAYOR MEI, THAT'S PRETTY ACCURATE.

19:31:08 WE BASE OUR PROPERTY TAX INFORMATION FOR THE NEXT YEAR LARGELY ON INFORMATION WE RECEIVE FROM THE COUNTY 
19:31:18  ASSESSOR, AND FROM DATA WE HAVE ON PROPERTY TRANSFER TAX FOR THE PRIOR CALENDAR YEAR, SINCE THE PROPERTY TAX 
19:31:23 REVENUE FOR THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR IS BASED ON THE ACTIVITY IN THE PRIOR CALENDAR YEAR.

19:31:35 AND AS YOU NOTED, OUR FORECAST FOR FUTURE YEARS IS BASED IN PART ON OUR HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, AND WHAT WE 
19:31:43 KNOW IS IN THE PIPELINE IN TERMS OF NEW DEVELOPMENT.
SO WE'RE CONSTANTLY UPDATING OUR 
19:31:49 FORECASTS, SO THEY DO CHANGE ON A REGULAR BASIS, ADD I THINK YOU WOULD WANT THEM TO.

19:31:59 THESE ARE, IN FACT, FORECASTS AND THEY'RE NOT PREDICTIONS OF THE FUTURE AND I DON'T HAVE A CRYSTAL BALL.

19:32:07 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
I DON'T THINK ANY OF US KNEW THAT AT THAT TIME, WE WERE LOOKING AT OUR 
19:32:12 BUDGET AND THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE AND OTHER THINGS THAT WE WOULD SEE SUCH A DRASTIC CHANGE AFTER WE WERE IMPACTED 
19:32:20 BY THE COVID IMPACTS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESSES, OUR COMMUNITY, AS WELL AS UNFORTUNATELY THE BUYER IMPACTS.

19:32:29 SO IT BEEN A VERY CHALLENGING YEAR, BUT I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS FURTHER DISCUSSION  REGARDING SOME JUST IN 
19:32:38 GENERAL THE -- THIS IS THE FIRST OF SEVERAL HEARINGS, AND I WOULD ENCOURAGE PEOPLE IF THEY HAVE SOME 
19:32:44 QUESTIONS, FEEL FREE TO SOME THOSE, BUT THE NEXT ITEM, I HOPE THEY'LL PARTICIPATE IN THE REVIEW AND 
19:32:51 DISCUSSION OF THE CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM THIS EVENING.
SO THANK YOU.

19:33:00 FINAL CALL, I DON'T SEE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COUNCIL, SO I'LL CLOSE THE PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD AND IF 
19:33:07 THERE'S NO OTHER ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS, THIS WILL BE COMING BACK IN -- DIRECTOR PERSSELIN, WOULD YOU LIKE TO 
19:33:13 SHARE THE TIME FRAME?
>> Mr. Persselin: SURE.
THE SECOND PUBLIC HEARING AND ADOPTION 
19:33:19 OF THE BUDGET AND THE APPROPRIATIONS LIMIT ARE SCHEDULED FOR NEXT TUESDAY, JUNE 15TH.

19:33:26 >> Mayor Mei: OKAYMENT AND I BELIEVE WE'VE ALSO SHARED LINKS TO THIS INFORMATION ON OUR WEBSITE, AND ALSO 
19:33:36 TO THE PROPOSED BUDGET, AND IF THERE'S QUESTIONS, TO PLEASE FEEL FREE TO JOIN US NEXT WEEK, BUT I THINK WE'VE ALSO 
19:33:48 NOTICED -- YOU CAN CONFIRM WITH ME.
SO IF THERE'S QUESTIONS, PLEASE MAKE SURE TO RAISE THOSE BEFORE THE 
19:33:52 MEETING.
>> Councilmember Cox: CAN I JUST ASK A QUICK QUESTION, MAYOR MEI?

19:34:03 IS THE NEXT -- SO THE NEXT ONE IS ON THE 15TH, THAT'S A SECOND HEARING.
IS THERE A THIRD HEARING OR IS IT A 
19:34:15 VOTING --
>> Mr. Persselin: THE ADOPTION IS HELD AT THE SAME MEETING WHERE WE HOLD THE 
19:34:17 SECOND  HEARING.
>> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.
THANK YOU.

19:34:28 >> Mayor Mei: YES, THAT'S BEEN THE PAST PRACTICE.
WE HAD A PUBLIC HEARING SO WE'VE 
19:34:33 ALREADY CLOSED THE PUBLIC HEARING.
SO I'M HOPING THE PERSON IS SPEAKING ON THE NEXT ITEM, BECAUSE WE ALREADY 
19:34:44 CLOSED THE PUBLIC HEARING.
SO THE NEXT ITEM, HOPEFULLY IT'S A CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM QUESTION, 
19:34:54 WE HAVE PUBLIC WORKS DIRECTOR HANS LARSEN ABLE FOR QUESTIONS.
I'LL ASK FOR QUESTIONS FROM THE 
19:35:04 COUNCIL ON THIS ITEM.
AGAIN, ATTACHMENTS ARE AVAILABLE ON OUR WEBSITE AS WELL AS LINKS TO IT.

19:35:14 >> Mr. Larsen: MAYOR MEI, IF I MIGHT, JUST FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE PUBLIC JUST KIND OF TO QUICKLY -- WE'RE 
19:35:21 PLEASED TO PRESENT THE CAPITAL BUDGET AND THE FIVE-YEAR CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM HERE FOR YOU TONIGHT.

19:35:30 AS YOU RECALL, WE HAD AN INITIAL MEETING WITH THE COUNCIL ON MARCH 9TH TO RECEIVE YOUR INPUT AS WE PREPARE 
19:35:40 THE CAPITAL PROGRAM.
WE HAD A DETAILED PRESENTATION ON THE CIP LAST MONTH AT A MEETING OF MAY 11 
19:35:45  11TH, SO WE'RE HERE TONIGHT WITH THE PRESENTATION OF THE PROPOSED FINAL CIP.

19:35:54 IT'S A 165-PAGE DOCUMENT THAT'S LINKED TO THE CITY'S STAFF REPORT AND THE CITY'S WEBSITE, AND THEN SIMILAR TO 
19:36:02 THE OPERATING BUDGET, WE'LL COME BACK TO YOU NEXT WEEK WITH THE FORMAL ACTIONS TO APPROVE THE  CIP FOLLOWING 
19:36:09 A SECOND PUBLIC HEARING.
MYSELF AND MEMBERS OF OUR STAFF ARE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY  QUESTIONS.

19:36:22 I MAY JUST POINT OUT, ONE OF THE PUBLIC COMMENTS ALREADY MADE CONCERNING QUIET ZONES IN CENTERVILLE, THAT'S ONE OF 
19:36:29 THE PROJECTS THAT'S INCLUDED, AS YOU RECALL, IT'S BEEN A CHALLENGING BUDGET, A LOT OF OUR REVENUES ARE DOWN 
19:36:36 DUE TO THE CHANGE IN THE ECONOMY RELATED TO COVID, BUT WE'RE PLEASED TO BE ABLE TO ADD A FEW NEW PROJECTS INTO 
19:36:44 THE PROGRAM AND HAPPY THAT ONE OF THOSE IS A QUIET ZONE PROGRAM IN THE CENTERVILLE CORRIDOR, AND I MAY JUST 
19:36:52 ANNOUNCE TOO THAT WE'RE REALLY PLEASED THAT WE ARE VERY CLOSE TO COMPLETING THE QUIET ZONE PROJECT IN THE NILES 
19:37:02 COMMUNITY AT THE NURSERY CROSSING.
WE ARE ON THE FINAL HOME STRETCHES OF COMPLETING THAT WORK, SO FOLLOWING 
19:37:07 THAT QUIET ZONE PROJECT, WE'RE READY FOR THE NEXT ONE.
SO I'LL TURN IT BACK TO YOU, MAYOR, 
19:37:15 FOR ANY QUESTIONS FROM YOU OR COUNCIL.
THANK YOU.
>> SO ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE COUNCIL 
19:37:20 AT THIS TIME?
I WAS GOING TO MAKE A GENERAL COMMENT FOR PEOPLE WHO WANT TO KNOW.

19:37:31 BESIDES THIS DOCUMENT, THERE IS ALSO A PAGE THAT'S DEDICATED TO SOME OF THE QUIET ZONES, GOES INTO DEPTH, I 
19:37:39 APOLOGIZE I DON'T HAVE IT IN FRONT OF ME RIGHT NOW BUT IT GOES INTO DETAILS TAIL ON THE PROJECTS.

19:37:45 IN PARTICULAR, FOR THE QUIET ZONE FOR NILES THAT WE'VE BEEN REFERENCING, THAT HAS BEEN IN CONVERSATIONS FOR 
19:37:52 QUITE SOME TIME, SINCE MY COUNCIL DAYS AND PART OF IT IS THERE HAVE BEEN CHANGES IN UNION PACIFIC, CHANGES WITH 
19:38:00 SOME OF THE REQUIREMENTS, AND SO I AM VERY MUCH LOOKING FORWARD TO US  FINALLY PUTTING CLOSURE TO THAT, AND I 
19:38:07 KNOW THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THE PUBLIC HAS ALWAYS EXPRESSED CONCERNS ABOUT, BUT WE'LL COMMENT ON SOME OF 
19:38:11 THE OTHER THINGS LATER.
I SEE WE HAVE A SPEAKER ON THIS ITEM, AND I THINK THERE WAS TWO.

19:38:20 SO I'LL TURN TO THE --
>> CHRIS HAD RAISED HIS HAND  FOR --
>> Mayor Mei: SO CHRIS, DO YOU WANT TO 
19:38:26 BEGIN ON THIS COMMENT, WHICH IS THE CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM?
I BELIEVE YOU HAD STARTED SPEAKING ON 
19:38:34 THAT.
>> YES, THANK YOU.
SO MY QUESTION IS ABOUT  FOLLOWING 
19:38:49 THINGS YEAR TO YEAR AND WHEN THEY GET DROPPED, AND COST CHANGES.
SO PWC -- NOW HAS A COST OF $150,000, 
19:38:54 BUT IT ORIGINALLY HAD A COST OF $235,000 AND WAS ALREADY SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN COMPLETED.

19:39:07 EVERYTHING ELSE I'VE SEEN THE COST ALWAYS GOES UP, THEN AT THE SAME PLACE, THERE'S A -- THAT HAD A REALLY 
19:39:14 HIGH PRICETAG AT 1.15 MILLION, AND THAT ONE IS TOTALLY GONE FROM THE NEXT BUDGET.

19:39:17 SO I'M INTERESTED IF THERE'S ANY INSIGHT ON THAT.
THANK YOU.

19:39:26 >> SURE.
I DON'T KNOW IF -- OKAY, NEXT SPEAKER IS ASHISH PATEL.

19:39:45 >> YES.
SO I RAISE THE SAME POINT I RAISED EARLIER, I SEE THE ONE IF YOU -- 21 
19:39:54 AND 22 AND THEN ANOTHER FOR -- WHAT YEAR IS IT, BUT IS THAT GOING TO BE ENOUGH FOR -- GIVEN THE SIZE OF THIS 
19:40:04 CENTERVILLE SECTION, RIGHT, IT HAS ALMOST FIVE ROADS INTERSECTING WITH THE RAIL LINE, AND ALL THOSE THINGS 
19:40:15 HAVE TO  BE -- ALL THE SECTIONS HAS TO BE MADE TO MAKE IT A QUIET ZONE PHYSICALLY, IMPROVE TO MAKE A BETTER 
19:40:29 -- IS IT ONLY FOR THE DESIGN OR IS IT REALLY -- AS PART OF THAT AMOUNT, SO IF YOU CAN'T PUT SOME CLARIFICATION ON 
19:40:39 THAT, THAT WOULD BE --
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
WE'LL TURN IT BACK TO THE COUNCIL FOR 
19:40:46 COMMENTS AT THIS TIME OR QUESTIONS.
I DON'T KNOW IF, HANS, YOU COULD ANSWER SOME OF THE ONES SPECIFICALLY 
19:40:52 TO CENTERVILLE.
I KNOW COSTS DO VARY AND LAST YEAR ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAPPENED, JUST TO 
19:41:01 LET THE PUBLIC KNOW, IS THAT WE WENT THROUGH OUR BUDGET DISCUSSIONS LAST  YEAR, THERE WAS A CONSCIENTIOUS 
19:41:08 DECISION BECAUSE THE UNPRECARIOUS NOTION ABOUT OUR BUDGET THAT WE DID FREEZE, SOME OF THE EXISTING BUDGET TO 
19:41:16 THE CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROGRAMS.
DIRECTOR PERSSELIN IS STILL ON, AS WELL AS HANS, SO I DON'T KNOW IF YOU 
19:41:21 WANT TO COMMENT ON THAT.
>> I CAN ANSWER THAT QUESTION FOR YOU BECAUSE THIS IS PART OF THE CAPITAL 
19:41:34 IMPROVEMENT PLAN AS WELL, AND SO WE ARE BRINGING FORTH TO YOU THIS YEAR AS PART OF THE DIP, WE'RE BRINGING A -- 
19:41:40 TO UPGRADE OUR PLAY AREAS THROUGHOUT THE PARK SYSTEM THIS YEAR, SO CENTERVILLE LAB IDENTIFIED FOR A PLAY 
19:41:49 AREA UPGRADE AS WELL, SO THAT IS WHAT YOU'RE SEEING IN THE UPGRADE.
NA DOES NOT MEAN THAT PREVIOUS  CIPs 
19:41:53 HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED.
IT JUST MEANS THEY AREN'T SHOWING UP IN THIS CIP PLAN.

19:42:00 SO THE LAND ALLIANCE AGREEMENT WE HAVE WITH FREMONT UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT WHICH INCLUDES THE RESTROOM AND THE 
19:42:06 PARK AREA THAT IS PART OF THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CONVEYANCE AGREEMENT WITH FREMONT UNIFIED SCHOOL DRIX, IS 
19:42:13 STILL BEING CONSIDERATIONS AND WE'RE WORKING FORWARD WITH THEM FORWARDS A SUCCESSFUL CONCLUSION ON THAT, AND WE 
19:42:21 WILL BE MOVING FORWARD TO MAKE SURE THAT THE RESTROOM IN PARTICULAR, WHICH IS UNDER CURRENT DESIGN AND PLAN FOR 
19:42:27 CONSTRUCTION BY THE END OF 2022.
SO THE MONEY IS CERTAINLY STILL THERE, AND ALTHOUGH IT SHOWS UP IN THREE 
19:42:33 DIFFERENT PWCs, IT IS PART OF AN OVERALL PROJECT SCOPE THAT IS PART OF THE LANCE AGREEMENT.

19:42:38 SO I HOPE THAT HELPS WITH THE INFORMATION.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:42:44 >> MAYOR MEI, I CAN SPEAK TO THE PUBLIC COMMENT REGARDING THE CENTERVILLE QUIET ZONE.

19:43:00 SO THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT'S IN THE BUDGET IS FOR PLANNING AND PROJECT -- TO BUILD THE IMPROVEMENT, THAT WE'VE 
19:43:15 BEEN ABLE TO -- SO OUR EXPECTATION IS WE DO THE ACE TRAIN IS KIND OF THE PRIMARY TRAIN THAT RUNS THROUGH THAT 
19:43:22 CORRIDOR, SO WE'LL BE WORKING WITH COUNTY AND OTHER REGIONAL PARTNERS TO TRY TO DEVELOP THE PROJECT, GET IT 
19:43:30 SCOPED OUT, AND THEN HOPEFULLY APPLY FOR REGIONAL FUNDING, EITHER AT THE REGIONAL, STATE OR FEDERAL LEVEL, TO 
19:43:35 BE ABLE TO FUND THE PROJECT FOR CONSTRUCTION.
SO THAT'S THE STRATEGY BEHIND THE 
19:43:44  INVESTMENT THAT'S SHOWN IN THE CIP.
>> THANK YOU.
I SEE ANOTHER HAND RAISED BUT I JUST 
19:43:50 WANTED TO CLARIFY FOR THE SPEAKER, WE HAVEN'T OFFICIALLY CLOSED THIS SO I'LL LET YOU SPEAK THIS TIME, BUT NORMALLY 
19:43:56 WE HAVE A PUBLIC COMMENT AND THEN WE DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE AN ONGOING CONVERSATION WITH THE PUBLIC, BUT I 
19:44:03 WOULD LIKE TO HEAR EVERYONE'S COMMENTS, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THIS IS THE FIRST HEARING, BRU YOU'RE THE LAST SPEAKER, 
19:44:09 CLOSE PUBLIC COMMENT AND BRING IT BACK TO THE  COUNCIL.
>> I APOLOGIZE, WOULD THIS BE AN 
19:44:14 APPROPRIATE TIME TO MAKE A GENERAL COMMENT ABOUT THE USE OF THE FUNDS FOR THINGS LIKE BIKE LANES?

19:44:29 >> Mayor Mei: SURE, BUT NOT ALL OF --
>> REGARDLESS OF THE SOURCE OF THE FUNDS, AS A RESIDENT AND A DRIVER, I'M 
19:44:38 NOT CRAZY ABOUT THE BIKE LANES DIMINISHMENT OF THE WINGS OF THE OLD LANES.

19:44:46 IT SEEMS A LITTLE EXCESSIVE.
I KNOW I'M A LITTLE LATE TO THE PARTY THAT IT'S BEEN -- I JUST FEEL AS A 
19:44:53 DRIVER THAT IT'S NOT VERY SAFE.
I JUST DON'T GET THE FEELING THAT A FULL -- TWO FULL SIZE S.U.V.s ARE 
19:45:01 GOING TO BE ABLE TO TRAVEL SAFELY AND COMFORTABLY ON THESE NEWLY WIDTH DIMINISHED FREMONT STREETS.

19:45:07 IF THE EFFORT IS TO MAKE IT  BETTER FOR BIKES AND SO FORTH, THERE WERE EXISTING BIKE LANES THAT WERE PRETTY 
19:45:13 GOOD FOR THAT PURPOSE.
SO I APOLOGIZE FOR BEING NEGATIVE ABOUT IT, BUT I'M JUST -- I'M NOT 
19:45:20 CRAZY ABOUT IT.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU, ERIK.

19:45:25 I DON'T KNOW IF DIRECTOR HANS -- I THINK THIS HAS BEEN A COMMENT THAT WE'VE BEEN HEARING A LITTLE BIT ABOUT 
19:45:30 RIGHT NOW.
PART OF IT IS IT'S A LITTLE HARDER TO SEE WHILE IT'S UNDER CONSTRUCTION, SO 
19:45:39 THERE'S THE ORANGE BARRIERS THERE, BUT THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE CERTAINLY COMMENTED ON WE ARE BALANCING THE FLOW 
19:45:46 BETWEEN THE DRIVERS AS WELL AS THE BIKE AND PEDESTRIAN SAFETY.
AND I DON'T KNOW, HANS, IF YOU WANTED 
19:45:50 TO REITERATE SOME OF THOSE THOUGHTS BEHIND THAT, I'D GREATLY APPRECIATE THAT.

19:45:56 BECAUSE I KNOW THIS HAS BEEN SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN COMING BEFORE THE COUNCIL AS OF LATE.

19:45:59 >> Mr. Larsen: YES, THANK YOU, MAYOR MEI, AND CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE COMMENT.

19:46:10 AS WE PRESENTED TO COUNCIL A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO WITH THE RENEWAL OF OUR VISION ZERO TRAFFIC SAFETY POLICY 
19:46:20  COMMITMENT, WE ARE COMMITTED TO MAKING OUR STREETS SAFE AND COMPLETE FOR ALL TRAVEL MODES, SO ONE OF THE STRATEGIES 
19:46:30 IS TO ACTUALLY NARROW THE LANES ON OUR ROADWAYS, AND THERE IS A STRONG CORRELATION BETWEEN THE NARROWER LANES 
19:46:36 AND SLOWER TRAFFIC SPEEDS.
THEN ALSO MORE SPACE IS CREATED FOR PEOPLE WALKING AND BIKING.

19:46:48 WE'VE HAD TREMENDOUS SUCCESS WITH THIS PROGRAM AS WE REPORTED TO COUNCIL, A 45% REDUCTION IN SEVERE AND FATAL 
19:46:58 TRAFFIC CLASSES AND IT'S DUES TO REALLY THE RE-ENGINEERING OF OUR STREETS, AND SAFETY FOR ALL USERS.

19:47:07 SO THERE'S A POLICY COMMITMENT FROM THE COUNCIL, AND GENERALLY THERE'S DIRECTION AT THE COUNTY, THE REGION, 
19:47:16 STATE, AND NOW EVEN THE FEDERAL LEVEL TO PURSUE THESE KINDS OF STRATEGIES FOR TRAFFIC SAFETY AND ACCOMMODATING 
19:47:22 TRAVEL FROM FROM ALL MODES.
SO WE DO HAVE INCLUDED IN OUR  CIP KIND OF THE CONTINUATION OF THIS LEVEL 
19:47:29 OF INVESTMENT, CONSISTENT WITH THE TRAFFIC ZERO SAFETY POLICY THAT CITY COUNCIL RECENTLY RENEWED.

19:47:36 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
I WILL TURN IT OVER TO COUNCIL FOR ANNOUNCEMENTS AND QUESTIONS.

19:47:46 COUNCILMEMBER COX?
>> Councilmember Cox: THANK YOU.
FOR THIS PART OF THE AGENDA, I HAD TWO 
19:47:52 QUESTIONS.
ONE IS WHEN IT'S TALKING ABOUT THE TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS, WAS THE 
19:48:01 AUTOMALL GRIMMER CONSIDERED PART OF THIS IMPROVEMENT FOR ACCESS FOR FREEWAY -- I WASN'T SURE ABOUT THAT, 
19:48:09 OR THE 880 INNOVATION DISTRICT, IS THAT AUTOMALL GRIMMER AREA CONSIDERED THAT, THE AUTOMALL, I SHOULD SAY, AUTOMALL 
19:48:19 PARKWAY?
>> Mr. Larsen: COUNCILMEMBER  COX, I'M NOT AWARE OF A PARTICULAR IMPROVEMENT 
19:48:32 THAT WE HAVE AT AUTOMALL AND GRIMMER.
WE DO HAVE ON THE 680 SIDE A PLAN TO IMPROVE OR MODERNIZE THE INTERCHANGE 
19:48:41 AT 680 AUTOMALL AND THE INTERSECTION AT OSGOOD AND AUTOMALL.
THAT'S ONE OF THE HIGH CONGESTION 
19:48:48 AREAS THAT WE'RE SEEKING TO IMPROVE AND SO WE HAVE A CONTINUING WORK GOING ON TO PLANT AN IMPROVEMENT THERE, AND 
19:48:54 THAT IS ALSO A PROJECT THAT WE THINK WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR REGIONAL FUNDING.

19:49:01 SO YEAH, THERE'S NOTHING SPECIFICALLY WE HAVE AT AUTOMALL AND GRIMMER.
>> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.

19:49:09 THANK YOU.
AND THEN I HAD A QUESTION FOR SUZANNE WOLF.

19:49:18 IN TERMS OF -- I'M EXCITED TO SEE THAT A LOT OF OUR PARKS ARE GETTING UPGRADE AND UPDATES AND IMPROVEMENTS, AND I 
19:49:24 WANTED TO GET A LITTLE BIT OF A CLARIFICATION IN TERMS OF, FOR EXAMPLE, THE UPGRADES TO THE PLAY 
19:49:33 AREA, DOES THAT MEAN THAT ARE YOU REPLACING ALL OF THE APPOINTMENT OR IS IT THAT YOU ARE ADDING MORE TO IT?

19:49:44 I'M NOT CLEAR ON THAT PART.
>> Ms. Wolf: SOME OF OUR EQUIPMENT HAS NOT BEEN UPGRADED FOR 25, 30 YEARS AND 
19:49:51 NEEDS MODERN SITUATION AND IN ORDER TO MEET THAT, WE ARE GOING TO BE UPGRADING THOSE PLAY FACILITIES IN 
19:49:57 SPECIFIC AREAS THAT ARE THE MOST NEEDED, AND THOSE HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED THROUGH OUR PARK MAINTENANCE 
19:50:03 STANDARDS.
AND WE'LL MODERNIZE THOSE AND TAKE DOWN THE OLD EQUIPMENT AND MODERNIZE 
19:50:11 THE EQUIPMENT THAT'S OUT THERE.
>> IS THAT ALSO LIKE I GUESS YOU'RE CHANGING ALSO THE SOFT FOAM-TYPE 
19:50:18 BOTTOM AS WELL TO SOMETHING NULL?
WHAT'S THE LATEST MATERIAL OR SOMETHING YOU'RE REPLACING IT WITH?

19:50:27 ANY IDEAS OR ANYTHING TO SHARE THERE?
>> Ms. Wolf: SO WE'LL BE USING THE EQUIPMENT THAT WE USED THROUGH OUR RFP 
19:50:33 PROCESS, THAT'S THROUGH A GENERAL FUND PROGRAM THAT WE GO THROUGH ANNUALLY, AND WE UPDATE AND REPAIR THAT ON AN 
19:50:36 ANNUAL BASIS.
>> OKAY, GREAT.
GREAT.

19:50:40 WELL I'LL BE CHECKING OUT SOME OF THE PARKS AND NOTICING SOME OF THESE DIFFERENCES.

19:50:45 SO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT AND ALSO THE TRANSPORTATION CHANGES TOO.
THANK YOU.

19:50:51 >> Mayor Mei: COUNCILMEMBER  KENG.
>> Councilmember Keng: THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR.

19:51:08 SO REGARDING THE VISION ZERO PROGRAM, I UNDERSTAND IT'S FOR SAFETY OF ALL, MOST  TRANSPORTERS, AND I WANTED TO 
19:51:17 SEE IF HANS COULD TELL US A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT -- RESIDENTS ARE CONCERNED THAT WHEN WE NARROW THE STREET, IT 
19:51:26 WOULD CAUSE MORE TRAFFIC JAMS AND I UNDERSTAND THAT WE ARE ALSO MODERNIZING OUR TRAFFIC LIGHTS TO MAKE 
19:51:32 THE WAIT AT THE LIGHTS SHORTER, SO PERHAPS WE CAN GET MORE INFORMATION ON  THAT.

19:51:39 >> Mr. Larsen: YES, THANK YOU, COUNCILMEMBER KENG.
I THINK WHAT YOU'RE SPEAKING TO IS 
19:51:49 REALLY THE BALANCE THE APPROACH THAT WE'RE TAKING TO OUR TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM, GENERALLY SLOW DOWN HIGH SPEED 
19:51:57 TRAFFIC AND MAKE OUR STREETS SAFER AND MORE COMFORTABLE FOR PEOPLE WALKING AND BIKING.

19:52:05 WE DO HAVE A PROGRAM TO IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY OF VEHICLE TRAVEL ACROSS THE CITY, AND THAT'S OUR TRAFFIC 
19:52:12 SIGNAL MODERN SITUATION PROGRAM, AND WHEN THE COUNCIL A COUPLE YEARS BACK APPROVED A MOBILITY ACTION PLAN FOR 
19:52:22  FREMONT, WHICH WAS DEVELOPED THROUGH A COMMUNITY TASK FORCE PROCESS, VERY MUCH THERE'S INTEREST IN HAVING A 
19:52:30 BALANCED LEVEL OF IMPLOFMENT.
SO THERE'S PROJECTS THAT ARE IMPROVING OR HIGHWAYS LIKE THE  G62 UPGRADE, 
19:52:35 WE'VE GOT SEVERAL INTERCHANGE UPGRADES.
BUT ONE OF THE BEST THINGS WE CAN DO 
19:52:46 IS TO MODERNIZE THE TECHNOLOGY THAT OUR SIGNALS ARE RUNNING ON, THE HARDWARE AND THE SOFTWARE IS PROBABLY CLOSE TO 
19:52:52 20 YEARS OLD IN A LOT OF THE  PLACES, SO IT DOES NOT PROCESS OR DETECT TRAFFIC IN THE MOST EFFICIENT WAY, AND 
19:53:00 SO WE'RE VERY PLEASED TO ALSO BE UNDERWAY WITH A PROGRAM FOR SIGNAL MODERNIZATION, AND THIS CAPITAL 
19:53:11 IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM DOES CONTINUE A STRONG LEVEL OF INVESTMENT FOR SIGNAL MODERNIZATION, AND WE'VE BEEN QUITE A 
19:53:15 BIT OF GRAND FUNDING FOR SIGNAL MODERNIZATION WORK AS WELL.
SO WE'LL CONTINUE TO SEE TRAFFIC 
19:53:25 SIGNALS GETTING UPGRATED AND MADE MORE EFFICIENT, SO REALLY THE GOAL IS WE WANT TRAFFIC TO BE -- VEHICLES TO BE 
19:53:37 ABLE TO MOVE MORE EFFICIENTLY.
THAT'S THE BALANCED APPROACH THAT'S REN SCENTED IN THE  POLICIES THAT THE 
19:53:45 COUNCIL HAS ADOPTED, AND BACK TO COUNCILMEMBER COX'S COMMENT ACTUALLY, THE INTERSECTION AT AUTOMALL AND 
19:53:59 GRIMMER PROBABLY VERY LIKELY IS PART OF OUR SIGNAL MODERNIZATION UP -- IT'S NOT CALLED OUT AS A SPECIFIC 
19:54:04 INTERSECTION.
WE DO KNOW THAT THE AUTOMALL CORRIDOR IS ONE OF OUR HIGHER PRIORITY 
19:54:13 CORRIDORS IN ORDER TO SYNCHRONIZE AND IMPROVE SIGNALS SO I CAN CHECK BACK WITH MY STAFF AND GET BACK TO YOU 
19:54:19 INFORMALLY, BUT I DO EXPECT THAT'S PROBABLY A LOCATION THAT'S CERTAINLY WITHIN THE PRIORITY LIST FOR THE NEXT 
19:54:23 FIVE YEARS.
I'D BE HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP ON ANY OTHER QUESTIONS ON THAT TOPIC.

19:54:27 THANK YOU.
>> Councilmember Keng: OKAY, THANK YOU.

19:54:32 >> Councilmember Cox: THAT WOULD BE GREAT, HANS, TO DO THAT.
THANK YOU.

19:54:37 >> Mayor Mei: SO I WAS GOING TO MAKE SOME JUST GENERAL COMMENTS.
I NO HE THE SPEAKERS HAD ASKED EARLIER 
19:54:47 AND I'VE BEEN FOLLOWING THESE CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PLANS ON MY WALL HERE AND THE BOOKSHELVES, BUT I KNOW THAT 
19:54:51 LOOKING AT THE CHANGES YEAR AFTER YEAR AND ALSO LOOKING AT SOME OF THE PROJECTS, IF PEOPLE WANTED TO HAVE 
19:54:58 FURTHER ADDITIONAL DETAIL ON ANY OF THESE, WHETHER IT'S THE PARK IMPROVEMENTS OR THE ONES FOR THE 
19:55:06 PROJECTS BEYOND WHAT'S PROVIDED THERE.
I KNOW FOR THE SAFE QUIET ZONES, WE HAVE SOME OF THAT INFORMATION DETAIL 
19:55:16 ON THAT WEBSITE, BUT IF SOMEBODY WANTED TO GET ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BEYOND THE TWO-LINE DESCRIPTORS, WOULD THEY 
19:55:22 BE ABLE TO WORK WITH ALL OF YOU TO SEE SOME OF THAT SO THEY CAN UNDERSTAND?
ESPECIALLY IT'S FOR YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD, 
19:55:30 I IMAGINE THEY'RE LOOKING AT THAT.
CAN YOU LET US KNOW, I GUESS HANS AND SUSAN, THE PROCESS BY WHICH SOMEONE 
19:55:42 WOULD GET MORE DETAIL.
>> Mr. Larsen: WE TO HAVE A LOT OF INFORMATION ON OUR SIEM, WE DO HAVE A 
19:55:52 WEBPAGE THAT HIGHLIGHTS THE PROGRAMS THAT WE'RE IMPLENTYING, SO THERE'S A LOT MORE TEE TAILED -- AS FAR AS THE 
19:55:56 SCOPE AND SCHEDULE.
SUZANNE, I DON'T WANT TO TAKE AWAY YOUR THUNDER HERE, BUT YOU AND THE 
19:56:02 PARKS TEAM DID SOME REALLY INNOVATIVE WORK IN TERMS OF COMMUNICATING WITH AT LEAST THE PLANNING COMMISSION -- OR 
19:56:09 THE REC. COMMISSION IN TERMS OF SOME OF THE NEW PROJECTS.
SO I'LL HAND IT OVER TO YOU TO EXPAND 
19:56:13 ON THAT.
>> Ms. Wolf: THIS YEAR WE HAD A VERY INNOVATIVE PROCESS IN THAT ALL OF OUR 
19:56:24 PROJECTS ARE ON OUR WEBSITE AND THEY WERE  VIDEOTAPED, SO OUR INOWE VAITIVE ARTISTS WENT OUT OF TOWN, THOSE ARE 
19:56:32 STILL LIVE ON OUR WEBSITE.
THE CAPITAL INFORMATION IS ON OUR FINANCE WEBPAGE FINANCE DEPARTMENT 
19:56:37 WEBSITE PAGE SO THAT GETS POSTED EVERY YEAR AS PART OF OUR ANNUAL BUDGET PROCESS, AND THAT WILL BE POSTED IN 
19:56:43 THIS YEAR'S AS WELL UNLESS -- HAS ANY UPDATE, MAYBE IT WILL BE POSTED ON THE FRONT PAGE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT FOR 
19:56:49 A PERIOD OF TIME.
BUT AGAIN, WE POST THAT EVERY YEAR AND WE'D BE EAP TO SHARE OUR VIT YOE 
19:56:59 TAPES, AGAIN, THAT THE TEAM DID A GREAT JOB -- ACROSS THE STATE FOR HOW TO GET INFORMATION ACROSS TO RESIDENTS.

19:57:04 >> Mayor Mei: RIGHT.
SO I JUST THINK THAT MAYBE WE NEED TO RE-POST THAT, ESPECIALLY FOR THE PARK 
19:57:10 PIECE OF IT, AND ALSO -- I ALSO WANTED TO REFERENCE PEOPLE IF THEY DIDN'T KNOW DURING OUR STUDY, BECAUSE WE ARE 
19:57:18 IN THE PROCESS OF UPDATING OUR 25 YEARS MASTER PARK PLAN WHICH WE WILL DO SO MORE REGULARLY IN THE FUTURE, BUT AS 
19:57:24 PART OF THAT, THERE WAS A DETAILED EFFORT IN TERMS OF HAPPY FEET AND WITH REPORTING, AND WE STILL HAVE THE APP 
19:57:31 AVAILABLE, SO IF YOU DO HAVE COMMENTS ABOUT PARK RELATED INFRASTRUCTURE, YOU CAN REPORT IT THERE AND IT DOES LINK 
19:57:40 TO A GIS CAPTURE SO IT TELLS US EXACTLY WHERE IS IT IS, BUT -- GENERATED AN AT LAS FOR EACH OF THE PARKS, SO MAYBE WE 
19:57:44 NEED TO REFERENCE THAT TO PEOPLE SO THEY CAN SEE.
IT ACTUALLY WENT THROUGH EACH OF THE 
19:57:50 PARKS THAT WE HAVE IN OUR CITY AND INVENTORIED TO LET US KNOW ABOUT WHAT STRUCTURES ARE GOOD, THE RATINGS ARE 
19:57:56 FAIR OR NEEDED TO BE REPLACED OR RECOMMENDED FOR REPLACEMENT.
AND SO IF YOU WERE INTERESTED IN A 
19:58:13 SPECIFIC PARK NEAR YOU, ALLOW YOU TO SEE THE DIFFERENT STRUCTURES AND COMMENTS -- ON DIFFERENT STRUCTURES 
19:58:19 OVER THE LAST COUPLE WEEKS, SOMEBODY HAD QUESTIONS ABOUT SANDBOXES, SO I WANTED TO LET PEOPLE KNOW THAT PART OF 
19:58:38 IT, I GREW UP IN PENNSYLVANIA, SOME ARE MORE DIFFICULT TO MAINTAIN, IT COULD BE USED UNFORTUNATELY BY WILDLIFE FOR 
19:58:47 OTHER PURPOSES OTHER THAN THIS SAND THAT CHILDREN WANT TO PLAY WITH, SO THEY'RE NOT ALWAYS AS HYGIENIC, SO 
19:58:54 CERTAIN STRUCTURES LIKE FOR SAFETY ISSUES, LIKE WHEN I WAS A KID, I REMEMBER CERTAINLY THE TEETER-TOTTERS 
19:59:03 AND OTHER THINGS BUT THEY'VE NOTED UNFORTUNATELY PROBABLY LITIGATION OR OTHER INJURIES THAT HAVE THEN CAUSED 
19:59:09 THEM TO BE REMOVED FROM CERTAIN PARKS AND LOCATIONS.
SO PART OF IT IS JUST UPDATING THAT 
19:59:14 AND MODERNIZING THAT WITH THE TIME.
SEEING NO OTHER COMMENTS, I WOULD LIKE TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO FOLLOW UP IF 
19:59:21 THERE ARE SPECIFIC PROJECTS, AGAIN, OR  PWCs OR CODES THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO KNOW ABOUT, I WOULD HOPE THAT THEY CAN 
19:59:28 CONTACT YOUR  TEAMS, EITHER PUBLIC WORKS OR PARKS AND RECREATION, AND TO GET THE SPECIFIC GREATER DETAIL IF 
19:59:34 THEY HAD SOMETHING SPECIFIC ON THOSE.
BUT THOSE WOULD BE PROBABLY THE BEST WAYS THAT WE COULD HELP SUPPORT OUR 
19:59:43 PUBLIC.
IF YOU CAN JUST MAKE SURE WE ARE ABLE TO GET THOSE BACK TO PEOPLE IDEALLY 
19:59:50 NEXT MEETING, THAT WOULD BE TERRIFIC.
SEEING NO OTHER COMMENTS FROM THE COUNCIL AT THIS TIME, I'D LIKE TO 
19:59:54 THANK EVERYONE, THIS IS OUR FIRST PUBLIC HEARING FOR BOTH OF THESE AGENDA ITEMS, HE?

20:00:06 .
IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN THE BUDGETARY PROCESS, PRACHES WE'LL POST THOSE ON 
20:00:12 THE SEEM, THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR TIME TODAY, I DON'T SEE ANY OTHER ADDITIONAL COMMENTS AT THIS TIME.

20:00:20 ARE THERE ANY OTHER ORAL REPORTS OUT FROM THE COUNCIL?
SEEING NONE, AT THIS MOMENT, I LOOK 
20:00:25 FORWARD TO EVERYONE'S PARTICIPATION AT THE NEXT UPCOMING COUNCIL MEETING ON THE 15TH.

20:00:34 AND SO WITH THAT, THE MEETING IS ADJOURNED AT 8:00 P.M.
SO THANK YOU.
