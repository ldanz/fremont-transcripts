19:06:05 ALSO WANTED TO WELCOME VICE MAYOR KENG.

19:06:23 ANY PERSON WISHING TO ADDRESS AN ITEM NOT ON THE AGENDA MAY DO SO UNDER THE 
19:06:25 ORAL COMMUNICATIONS SECTION OF PUBLIC  COMMUNICATIONS.

19:06:27 SO I'D LIKE TO OPEN IT UP.

19:06:31 I SEE LISA DANZ.

19:06:34 WELCOME, MS. DANZ.

19:06:41 >> HI.

19:06:41 THANK YOU.

19:06:44 SORRY, IT TOOK A MINUTE FOR THE UNMUTE TO POP UP.

19:06:44 GOOD EVENING.

19:06:49 THIS IS LISA DANZ, AND I'M A MEMBER OF FREMONT FOR EVERYONE, AND I WANTED TO 
19:06:56 SHARE THAT EARLIER THIS EVENING, SEVERAL OF OUR DEDICATED MEMBERS, SIX 
19:07:01 PEOPLE, MET TO DISCUSS THE FREMONT'S DRAFT HOUSING ELEMENT, AND WE'RE 
19:07:06 PREPARING TO PRESENT OUR FINDINGS AND CONCERNS IN VARIOUS FORMS, INCLUDING 
19:07:09 WRITTEN PUBLIC COMMENT BY THE AUGUST WILLTH DEADLINE.

19:07:14 WE'RE TESTING ASSUMPTIONS AND METHODOLOGIES IN THE DRAFT HOUSING 
19:07:16 ELEMENT ON SITE  CAPACITY, INCLUDING DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT PROJECTIONS AND 
19:07:20 MEETING THE NEW STATE MANDATED OBJECTIVES FOR AFFIRMATIVELY 
19:07:25 FURTHERING FOR HOUSING AND WE REALLY WANT TO SEE FREMONT GO EVEN BEYOND THE 
19:07:28 RHNA ALLOCATIONS FOR THE VERY LOW INCOME, LOW INCOME AND MODERATE INCOME 
19:07:28  UNITS.

19:07:34 SOME OF OUR OVERRIDING CONCERNS INCLUDE WHETHER THE SITES CHOSEN ARE VIABLE 
19:07:37 FOR NEW HOUSING CONSTRUCTION, AND EVEN IF THEY'RE TECHNICALLY VIABLE, ARE 
19:07:42 THEY DESIRABLE, RESPECTING QUALITY OF LIFE AND WALKABLE ACCESS TO AMENITIES 
19:07:44 AND CREATING SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES.

19:07:49 WE AT FREMONT FOR EVERYONE ARE CONCERNED THAT THERE'S HISTORICALLY 
19:07:54 BEEN SORT OF A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE RHNA PLAN VERSUS THE -- WHAT ACTUALLY 
19:07:58 GET BUILT AS FAR AS NOT HAVING AS MANY OF THE LOWER INCOME UNITS AS WE GET OF 
19:08:00 THE ABOVE MODERATE INCOME UNITS.

19:08:02 SO THAT'S JUST A QUICK PREVIEW.

19:08:07 LIKE I SAID, WE'RE STILL DISCUSSING AND WE'LL RELEASE A MORE FORMAL COMMENT 
19:08:09 AFTER WE HAVE A CHANCE TO REVIEW IT MORE DEEPLY.

19:08:13 WE'RE TRYING TO DO A DEEP DIVE ON ALL THOSE DETAIL.

19:08:17 AND I WANTED TO SAY SPEAKING OF THAT AUGUST 8TH PUBLIC COMMENT DEADLINE, I 
19:08:20 HOPE THAT OTHER MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC LISTENING TONIGHT ALSO FEEL EMPOWERED 
19:08:25 TO REVIEW THE HOUSING ELEMENT AND PROVIDE THEIR COMMENT TO  
19:08:27 HOUSINGELEMENT@FREMONT.GOV.

19:08:27 THAT'S ALL.

19:08:28 THANK YOU.

19:08:30 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

19:08:33 NEXT SPEAKER WILL BE KELLY  ABREU.

19:08:34 WELCOME, KELLY.

19:08:39 >> THANK YOU.

19:08:46 THERE'S A COUPLE OF REFERRALS ON THE AGENDA TODAY, AND IT'S -- YOU KNOW, IT 
19:08:50 SEEMS LIKE WE'RE RUNNING IN PLACE ACTUALLY  FALLING BEHIND.

19:08:54 YOU KNOW, THE LEGS ARE MOVING, BUT THE BODY OF THE CITY GOVERNMENT IS FALLING 
19:08:55 BEHIND.

19:09:01 LET'S LOOK AT A REFERRAL ISSUED LAST JULY, ALMOST EXACTLY A YEAR AGO, A 
19:09:02 LITTLE OVER A YEAR AGO.

19:09:05 CAME FROM COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN.

19:09:13 COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN REFERRED SOMETHING ABOUT AN -- REVIEW AND STAFF AGREED, 
19:09:18 AND OF COURSE AGREED TO DO THAT REVIEW AND LOOK INTO ALL THE CONCERNS THAT 
19:09:20 WERE RAISED.

19:09:24 THE ENTIRE CITY COUNCIL THAT'S SITTING HERE VOTED IN FAVOR OF THAT.

19:09:32 STAFF WENT OFF A YEAR AGO, AND NEVER TO CONDUCT THAT REVIEW.

19:09:33 THEY HAVEN'T COME BACK YET.

19:09:35 WHERE IS THAT?

19:09:43 IT SEEMS LIKE STAFF IS WILLFULLY UNRESPONSIVE TO COUNCIL DIRECTION.

19:09:48 SO HERE WE CAN PUT THE BLAME FIRMLY ON STAFF, I THINK A YEAR IS LONG ENOUGH 
19:09:48 TO CONDUCT A REVIEW.

19:09:53 BUT MAYBE IT'S MORE COMPLICATED THAN I KNOW.

19:09:58 IT'S VERY ADVANCED WORK THAT MIGHT TAKE LONGER THAN A YEAR TO LOOK AT ANIMAL 
19:10:07 ORDINANCES AND GOATS AND APIARIES, SHEEP, WHATEVER.

19:10:08 I DON'T KNOW.

19:10:12 THEN THERE WAS ANOTHER REFERRAL ISSUED, CAME FROM COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN IN 
19:10:13 DECEMBER 2020.

19:10:19 HE SAID, HEY, WE NEED TO HEAR ABOUT -- AN UPDATE ON THE LEASH RENEWAL AT 
19:10:19 MISSION PEAK.

19:10:21 EVERYONE GOT ONE IN NOVEMBER.

19:10:29 IT SEEMS LIKE IT WAS, WHAT, THREE, FOUR HOURS OF ANGER DIRECTED AT THE EAST 
19:10:35 BAY REGIONAL PARK DISTRICT BECAUSE YOU WANTED THE AUTHORITY TO CLOSE DOWN THE 
19:10:36 PARK TO PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH.

19:10:41 THE ONLY REGIONAL PARK IN AMERICA THAT IS DEEMED A THREAT TO PUBLIC HEALTH.

19:10:44 BUT THEN WHAT HAPPENED?

19:10:51 WELL, THAT WAS IN NOVEMBER, AND HERE WE ARE, WHAT, IN -- IT BEEN A WHILE, 
19:10:51 RIGHT?

19:10:56 WE STILL DON'T HAVE -- YOU KNOW, THERE'S NO UPDATE ON THE LEASE RENEWAL.

19:10:59 WELL, WE KNOW WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE LEASE RENEWAL.

19:11:03 THE CITY COUNCIL SABOTAGED IT.

19:11:03 IT WAS DESTROYED.

19:11:09 IT WAS DESTROYED BY COUNCIL ACTION SUCH THAT THOSE NEGOTIATIONS ARE IN A 
19:11:09 SHAMBLES.

19:11:14 THANKS TO THE ANIMOSITY OF THIS CITY COUNCIL.

19:11:18 SO SOMETIMES THESE REFERRALS, WHEN THEY START OUT WITH GOOD INTENTIONS, BUT 
19:11:22 THEY'RE  SABOTAGED BY THE SAME PEOPLE THE CITY COUNCIL THAT MADE THE 
19:11:22 REFERRAL.

19:11:27 AND THEN THERE WAS -- LET'S -- AS PART OF THAT, LET'S GO BACK TO THAT 
19:11:32 WONDERFUL SUGGESTION, LET'S TAKE THE POLL AND BRING IT DOWN TO THE BOTTOM 
19:11:38 OF THE HILL, WHY DON'T YOU TAKE A LARGE LOGO OF THE CITY OF FREMONT AND PUT 
19:11:41 THE LOGO RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE PARK, RIGHT NEXT TO THE HILL SO PEOPLE CAN 
19:11:45 TAKE A PICTURE OF YOUR LOGO ALONGSIDE THE MOUNTAIN.

19:11:46 IT WOULD BE LOVELY.

19:11:47 THANK YOU.

19:11:47 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:11:52 NEXT SPEAKER IS SALIM MASTAN.

19:11:53 WELCOME, SALIM.

19:11:55 >> HI.

19:11:56 CAN YOU HEAR ME, MAYOR?

19:11:57 >> Mayor Mei: YES.

19:11:59 >> AM I LOUD AND CLEAR?

19:12:00 >> Mayor Mei: YES.

19:12:01 >> OKAY, HI.

19:12:02 HELLO, MAYOR.

19:12:03 HELLO, CITY COUNCILMEMBERS.

19:12:09 THE FIRST SPEAKER SAID SOMETHING WHICH IS VERY CLOSE TO MY HEART.

19:12:11 AND I HAVE A VERY, VERY BIG CONCERN.

19:12:26 AND MY CONCERN IS THAT WE, THE CITIZENS OF FREMONT, HAVE NO POLICE, FIRE, OR 
19:12:35 SECURITY PEOPLE LIVING IN THE CITY OF FREMONT, AND ALL OF THEM, MOST OF 
19:12:41 THEM, 95% IS WHAT I HEARD, ARE LIVING IN TRACY OR STOCKTON OR WATER VIEW.

19:12:52 SO I WANT THE CITY POLICE TO HAVE AT LEAST, AT LEAST, CITY POLICE, THE FIRE 
19:12:57 DEPARTMENT, GOD FORBID THERE'S AN EARTHQUAKE, THERE IS A RIOT, THERE IS 
19:13:03 ANY EMERGENCY THAT HAPPENS, WE DON'T HAVE ANYBODY IN OUR CITY TO PROTECT US.

19:13:13 AND NOW THAT WE ARE BECOMING, THANK GOD, THANK GOD AFFLUENT, PEOPLE FROM 
19:13:20 OTHER PLACES ARE COMING IN AND WE ARE GETTING  MUGGED, OUR CARS ARE BEING 
19:13:28 BROKEN INTO, AND WE FEEL THAT WE SHOULD HAVE AT LEAST 20 TO 25 POLICE OFFICERS 
19:13:32 LIVING IN THE CITY AND FOR WHICH I HAVE A SOLUTION.

19:13:42 I WOULD OFFER THE POLICE DEPARTMENT AT LEAST 20 BELOW MARKET RATE HOMES, 
19:13:50 CONDOS, OR RENT FOR THE POLICE DEPARTMENT AT A LOWER RATE TO ALL NEW 
19:13:57 COMING OFFICERS HAVE TO LIVE IN THE CITY OF FREMONT, AND IF THEY WANT TO 
19:13:58 SERVE HERE IN OUR POLICE DEPARTMENT.

19:14:09 THIS IS WHEN THE RODNEY CASE, RODNEY KING CASE HAPPENED IN LOS ANGELES, THE 
19:14:17 PEOPLE RIOTED IN THE PLACE CALLED KOREAN TOWN OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT, 
19:14:24 AND  THAT, THE KOREANS, THE RESIDENTS OF THAT PLACE HAD NO PROTECTION.

19:14:31 LORD FORBID SOMETHING HAPPENS LIKE THAT HERE AT 9:00 IN THE NIGHT, WE HAVE NO 
19:14:31 PROTECTION.

19:14:34 WE ARE THE HAPPIEST CITY IN THE WORLD.

19:14:39 WE ARE HAPPY BECAUSE ALL OF US ARE WORKING TOGETHER TO KEEP IT HAPPY.

19:14:47 SO I WILL REQUEST, I'VE SPOKEN WITH THE POLICE CHIEF, HE SAYS THAT PRICES ARE 
19:14:55 VERY EXPENSIVE, OFFICERS WANT TO STAY AWAY, BUT THEN THERE MIGHT BE SOME 
19:15:00 MEDIUM WHERE WE CAN HAVE PROTECTION, THE FIRE DEPARTMENT, THE POLICE 
19:15:06 DEPARTMENT, THE EMERGENCY SERVICES PEOPLE LIVING IN FREMONT, NOT --

19:15:06 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:15:16 AND I DON'T SEE ANY OTHER PUBLIC SPEAKERS AT THIS TIME, SO I'M GOING TO 
19:15:18 CLOSE ORAL COMMUNICATIONS.

19:15:27 NEXT ON OUR AGENDA THIS EVENING IS ITEM 7A, WHICH IS OUR GENERAL OBLIGATION 
19:15:32 BONDS, AND THE TAX RATE FOR FISCAL YEAR 2022 AND 23.

19:15:36 THERE IS NO FORMAL PRESENTATION THIS EVENING FOR THIS ITEM.

19:15:42 BUT I HAVE FINANCE DIRECTOR DAVE PERSSELIN, WHO IS AVAILABLE TO ANSWER 
19:15:47 ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE COUNCILMEMBERS OR COMMENTS FROM THE PUBLIC, AND I'LL 
19:15:49 BEGIN FIRST WITH QUESTIONS FROM THE COUNCILMEMBERS.

19:15:54 ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE COUNCILMEMBERS ON THIS ITEM?

19:15:58 OKAY.

19:16:04 SEEING NONE, I'M GOING TO OPEN THE PUBLIC HEARING FOR PUBLIC COMMENT.

19:16:09 AND THIS IS, AGAIN, ITEM 7A, WHICH IS THE GENERAL OBLIGATION BONDS.

19:16:16 I SEE NO SPEAKERS ON THAT.

19:16:20 >> Councilmember Cox: I'D LIKE TO MAKE A MOTION.

19:16:22 >> Mayor Mei: SO I WILL CLOSE THE PUBLIC COMMENT.

19:16:28 AND THEN I WOULD LIKE TO ASK FOR A MOTION AND I THINK COUNCILMEMBER COX 
19:16:30 HAD OFFERED TO MAKE THE MOTION.

19:16:33 AND WOULD ANYONE LIKE TO SECOND THIS MOTION?

19:16:36 >> Councilmember Keng: I JUST HAVE A QUICK QUESTION.

19:16:38 >> Councilmember Jones: I'LL SECOND.

19:16:39 >> Mayor Mei: I'M SORRY.

19:16:42 COUNCILMEMBER KENG, HAVE A QUESTION?

19:16:43 >> Councilmember Keng: SORRY.

19:16:50 SO I WANTED TO HEAR THE STAFF -- [INAUDIBLE] COMMUNICATE THIS TO THE 
19:16:51 GENERAL PUBLIC OF THIS BOND.

19:16:56 >> Mayor Mei: EXCUSE ME, I'M SORRY, YOU WERE BREAKING UP WHEN YOU WERE 
19:16:56 SPEAKING JUST NOW.

19:17:01 I HEARD STAFF TO --

19:17:05 >> HOW WE WILL SHARE THIS INFORMATION WITH THE GENERAL PUBLIC.

19:17:15 >> Mr. Persselin: THE NEW TAX RATES WILL APPEAR ON THE ASSESSMENT 
19:17:17 STATEMENT THAT EVERY PROPERTY OWNER RECEIVES.

19:17:25 >> Mayor Mei: AGAIN, I THINK MANY OF YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE STATEMENTS 
19:17:28 THAT WE RECEIVE, IF YOU'RE A PROPERTY OWNER IN THE CITY OF FREMONT, MUCH 
19:17:30 LIKE OTHER CITIES, YOU RECEIVE A STATEMENT ANNUALLY.

19:17:36 AND SO MY UNDERSTANDING, TO CLARIFY AGAIN, DIRECTOR PERSSELIN, IS THAT AS 
19:17:42 SUCH, THERE WILL BE -- AND THIS IS PART OF THE NOVEMBER 2002, THE FREMONT 
19:17:47 VOTERS VOTED ON THIS MEASURE R, WHICH AUTHORIZED  THIS.

19:17:50 SO IT'S MOTIONED AND SECONDED.

19:17:55 >> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: MAYOR, JUST TO CLARIFY THAT WAS A MOTION TO ACCEPT 
19:17:56 STAFF'S RECOMMENDATION?

19:17:58 >> Councilmember Cox: CORRECT.

19:18:00 >> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: THANK YOU.

19:18:01 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:18:05 AND A SECOND, AND THAT'S TO ESTABLISH THE FIRE SAFETY PROJECT GENERAL 
19:18:14 OBLIGATION BOND TAX RATE OF 0.0039 PER $100 PER ASSESSED VALUATION FOR FISCAL 
19:18:16 YEAR 2022 AND '23.

19:18:18 AND ALSO TO ADOPT THE RESOLUTION.

19:18:25 AUTHORIZING ALAMEDA COUNTY -- COUNTY OF ALAMEDA TO LEVY A TAX ON THIS TAXABLE 
19:18:27 PORTION PER THE VOTER-APPROVED BOND.

19:18:29 KOCH COX EXACTLY.

19:18:31 >> Mayor Mei: SO MOTIONED AND SECONDED.

19:18:33 MOTIONED BY COUNCILMEMBER COX, SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER JONES.

19:18:35 ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE.

19:18:38 >> Ms. Gauthier: COUNCILMEMBER COX, AYE.

19:18:41 COUNCILMEMBER SHAO, AYE.

19:18:43 COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, AYE.

19:18:46 COUNCILMEMBER JONES, AYE.

19:18:48 COUNCILMEMBER KENG, AYE.

19:18:51 VICE MAYOR SALWAN, AYE.

19:18:53 MAYOR MEI, AYE.

19:18:55 SO THE MOTION PASSES  UNANIMOUSLY.

19:18:56 THANK YOU.

19:19:04 NEXT ON THE AGENDA THIS EVENING IS ITEM 7B, AND THAT IS THE CITYWIDE 
19:19:06 FIBEROPTICS MASTER  PLAN.

19:19:11 AND WE HAVE PRESENTING THIS  ITEM -- OR INTRODUCING THE ITEM THIS EVENING WILL 
19:19:28 BE OUR ITS DIRECTOR, SANDY TAYLOR WHO WILL PRESENT THE ITEM.

19:19:32 >> GOOD EVENING, MAYOR MEI AND COUNCILMEMBERS.

19:19:35 I'M SANDY TAYLOR, INFORMATION OFFICER.

19:19:40 JOINING ME TONIGHT TO DISCUSS THIS ON THE MASTER PLAN ITEM, ALSO FROM 
19:19:47 INFORMATION  TECHNOLOGY, IS OUR INFRASTRUCTURE MANAGER, DAVID  YU, AND 
19:19:54 JORY WOLF FROM MAGELLAN ADVISORS.

19:19:57 WE SELECTED THEM DUE TO THEIR EXPERTISE, SPECIALIZING IN THE 
19:20:03 COMPLETE DEVELOPMENT OF FIBER BACKBONES, REGIONAL NETWORKS AND MANY 
19:20:09 WIRELESS TECHNOLOGIES FOR BOTH URBAN APPLICATIONS AND RURAL BROADBAND.

19:20:15 YOU'LL FIND TONIGHT IN THEIR PRESENTATION, THE NETWORK IS DESIGNED 
19:20:18 TO BE PURPOSE-BUILT TO SUPPORT OUR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS, PUBLIC 
19:20:24 SAFETY, PARKS AND RECREATION, SMART CITY INITIATIVES, AND THE APPLICATION 
19:20:25 OF INTERNET OF THINGS.

19:20:31 THE NETWORK IS ALSO  CUSTOM-DESIGNED TO ACHIEVE OUR CITY'S UNIQUE GOALS, AND 
19:20:35 WITH THAT, I'D NOW LIKE TO TURN THIS OVER TO MAGELLAN TO GIVE THEIR 
19:20:35 PRESENTATION.

19:20:38 JORY?

19:20:39 ?

19:20:39 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:20:49 >> THANK YOU, MR. TAYLOR, AND GOOD EVENING, MAYOR AND CITY COUNCILMEMBERS.

19:20:52 JORY WOLF WITH MAGELLAN  ADVISORS.

19:20:57 WITH ME TONIGHT IS PRESTON YOUNG, WHO IS A PROJECT MANAGER.

19:21:01 I WAS THE PROJECT EXECUTIVE WORKING WITH THE WEST COAST TEAM OF MAGELLAN 
19:21:06 ADVISORS, ASSISTING THE CITY OF FREMONT WITH THEIR FIBEROPTIC MASTER PLAN.

19:21:10 HOPEFULLY YOU CAN ALL SEE MY SCREEN, AND MY PRESENTATION.

19:21:16 AND I'LL MOVE THROUGH THE DOCUMENT AND HOPEFULLY I'LL ADDRESS ALL OF YOUR 
19:21:20 QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE THIS EVENING ABOUT BROADBAND FOR FREMONT.

19:21:26 PLEASE KNOW THAT THE PROJECT GOALS AND OBJECTIVES WERE MULTIFACETED.

19:21:34 THERE WERE INVESTIGATION INTO THE EXISTING ASSETS THAT WERE AVAILABLE 
19:21:44 FOR THE CITY OF FREMONT FOR BOTH CITY  OPERATIONS, FOR BUSINESSES AND FOR RES 
19:21:45 DENSES AS WELL.

19:21:48 THE ANALYSIS FOR THESE BROAD BAND INFRASTRUCTURES WAS IMPORTANT BECAUSE 
19:21:53 WE WANTED TO SEE WHAT WAS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE IN TERMS OF PUBLIC ASSETS 
19:21:59 AND ALSO PRIVATE PROVIDER ASSETS THAT COULD BE USED IN BUILDING, EXPANDING 
19:22:03 AND LOWERING THE COST OF CONSTRUCTION FOR PROVIDING THIS NEW UTILITY TO THE 
19:22:04 COMMUNITY.

19:22:13 WE ALSO TOOK A LOOK AT THE NEEDS OF THE CITY ITSELF, AND ALSO THE RES DENTS 
19:22:17 AND BUSINESSES THROUGH SURVEYS AND WORKSHOPS, ALSO INTERVIEWS WITH ALL OF 
19:22:22 YOUR KEY DEPARTMENTS, AND ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO USE BROADBAND AND 
19:22:24 TELECOMMUNICATIONS IN THEIR EVERYDAY WORK WITH THE  COMMUNITY.

19:22:31 WE DEVELOPED HIGH LEVEL DESIGN FOR THIS PROJECT, AND PRESTON WILL GO OVER THAT 
19:22:36 IN A FEW MOMENTS LATER IN THIS PRESENTATION ABOUT A  THREE-PHASED 
19:22:43 IMPLEMENTATION  PLAN, ALONG WITH THE ACTUAL DESIGN FOR CONSTRUCTION, AND 
19:22:49 ALSO COST ESTIMATIONS FOR  RUNNING THE NETWORK THROUGH A PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP, 
19:22:51 OR I SHOULD SAY A PUBLIC-PRIVATE  PARTNERSHIP.

19:22:56 WE ALSO TOOK A LOOK AT YOUR POLICIES AND EVALUATED WHAT NEEDED TO BE DONE 
19:23:01 FOR  BROADBAND-FRIENDLY APPROACHES WITH YOUR EXISTING POLICIES, WHAT NEEDED TO 
19:23:06 BE ADJUSTED AND WHAT NEEDED TO BE AMENDED AS WELL AS WHAT NEEDED TO BE 
19:23:12 ADDED IN TERMS OF DIG ONCE, IN TERMS OF JOINT BUILD, AND OTHER OPPORTUNITIES 
19:23:14 AND BEST PRACTICES FOR THE CITY.

19:23:20 WE TOOK A LOOK AT WHAT BUSINESS MODEL WOULD BE MOST EFFECTIVE BASED UPON THE 
19:23:26 CITY'S CAPABILITIES, ITS EXISTING RESOURCES, LOCAL PROVIDERS AND OTHERS 
19:23:31 THAT WE COULD PARTNER WITH TO ASSIST YOU IN THE  EFFORT, AND OF COURSE, WE 
19:23:34 LOOKED AT THIS AS A LONG-TERM PLAN OVER THE COURSE OF 20 YEARS.

19:23:42 PLEASE KNOW THAT THE EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE AT THE CITY OF FREMONT 
19:23:48 IS NOT THAT EXTENSIVE, BUT IT IS MEETING THE NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY.

19:23:52 AS YOU CAN SEE HERE, WE TOOK A LOOK TO SEE HOW MUCH FIBER IS CURRENTLY IN THE 
19:23:59 CITY OF FREMONT NOT OWNED BY THE CITY BUT OWNED BY PRIVATE PROVIDERS, AND 
19:24:02 THERE IS A NUMBER OF PROVIDERS AS YOU CAN SEE HERE ON THIS MAPPING THAT DO 
19:24:10 PROVIDE SERVICES TO BUSINESSES AND INSTITUTIONS IN FREMONT.

19:24:15 WE ALSO TOOK A LOOK TO SEE WHAT THE CITY OF FREMONT AND OTHER PUBLIC 
19:24:21 AGENCIES HAD IN TERMS OF FIBER RUNNING THROUGH YOUR CORPORATION LIMITS, AND 
19:24:25 WE FOUND CALTRANS FIBER, OF COURSE YOU HAVE EXISTING TRAFFIC SIGNAL 
19:24:30 INTERCONNECT THAT YOU SEE IN GREEN, AND THEN OF COURSE  CITY-OWNED FIBER 
19:24:31 CABLES THAT YOU SEE IN ORANGE.

19:24:37 THIS IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU CURRENTLY HAVE IN THE GROUND 
19:24:43 TODAY, AND WHAT CAN BE USED TO FURTHER ECONOMIC  DEVELOPMENT, IMPROVEMENTS IN 
19:24:48 QUALITY OF LIFE, GOVERNMENT, INNOVATION AND SMART CITY APPLICATIONS.

19:24:54 WE ALSO TOOK A LOOK TO SEE THE NUMBER OF SERVICE PROVIDERS THAT WERE IN 
19:24:56 FREMONT, AND DID A MARKET ANALYSIS.

19:25:02 AND IT WAS NOT SURPRISING TO SEE THAT IN MOST OF FREMONT, YOU HAVE THREE OR 
19:25:04 MORE SERVICE PROVIDERS.

19:25:10 INCUMBENTS, AS WELL AS OTHERS THAT ARE PROVIDING SERVICES TO BUSINESSES AND 
19:25:10 RESIDENTS.

19:25:14 AND YOU CAN SEE HOW THAT'S DIVIDED UP THROUGHOUT THE CITY IN BLUE.

19:25:19 IN SOME LOCATIONS, WE HAVE LESS THAN THREE, BUT THERE ARE STILL AT LEAST 
19:25:24 TWO PROVIDERS THAT ARE COMPETITIVELY OPERATING NETWORKS AND MARKETING THOSE 
19:25:27 AGGRESSIVELY TO YOUR BUSINESSES AND YOUR RESIDENTS.

19:25:35 WE TOOK A LOOK TO SEE WHAT WAS THE NEED, THEN, FOR THE CITY OF FREMONT, 
19:25:41 AND WE FELT THAT IMPROVED BROADBAND AND IMPROVED FIBEROPTICS, WHICH IS THE 
19:25:44 GOLD STANDARD FOR THIS NEW UTILITY THAT WE'VE ALL GROWN ACCUSTOMED TO AND 
19:25:49 LEARNED TO LIVE WITH BECAUSE OF THE EMERGING DIGITAL WORLD THROUGH COVID, 
19:25:52 AND NOW THROUGH OUR NEW ECONOMIES, DIGITAL ECONOMIES.

19:25:58 WE WANTED TO SEE HOW WE COULD SUPPORT YOUR MANUFACTURING SECTOR, WHICH IS A 
19:26:01 VERY LARGE PORTION OF YOUR BUSINESS SECTOR.

19:26:07 WE ALSO WANTED TO LOOK TO SEE WHERE THERE ARE AREAS IN FREMONT THAT ARE 
19:26:13 LACKING HIGH QUALITY AND HIGH BANDWIDTH BROADBAND.

19:26:16 WE ALSO WANTED TO DO THIS FOR THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, BECAUSE WITHOUT 
19:26:20 BROADBAND, YOU DON'T HAVE A GOOD ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PLAN.

19:26:22 YOU ALSO DON'T HAVE GOOD COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT PLANS.

19:26:28 BROADBAND AS A UTILITY ATTRACTS BUSINESSES, BUT MOST  IMPORTANTLY, IT 
19:26:32 RETAINS THE BUSINESSES THAT YOU'VE BEEN ABLE TO GET TO MOVE INTO YOUR 
19:26:36 COMMUNITY, THUS SUPPORTING JOBS AND GOOD QUALITY OF LIFE FOR YOUR 
19:26:37 RESIDENTS AND YOUR BUSINESSES.

19:26:42 WE ALSO TOOK A LOOK AT WHAT YOU WERE DOING WITH YOUR TRAFFIC SIGNAL 
19:26:44 MODERNIZATION PROGRAM, AND WHY?

19:26:51 BECAUSE TRAFFIC SIGNALS HAVE UNDERGROUND CONDUIT AND VERY MUCH LIKE 
19:26:54 TELECOMMUNICATIONS CONDUIT, THOSE CONDUITS CAN BE REPURPOSED FOR 
19:26:55 BROADBAND AS  WELL.

19:26:59 SO WE WANTED TO BE SURE THAT WE WERE MAKING GOOD USE OF YOUR INVESTMENTS IN 
19:27:03 YOUR MODERNIZATION OF YOUR TRAFFIC SIGNAL SYSTEM BECAUSE THAT ACTUALLY 
19:27:09 CAN BE USED AS YOU SAW ON THE MAP PRIOR FOR EXPANDING YOUR BROADBAND ASSETS.

19:27:16 WE TOOK A LOOK AT PRIVATE -- PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS AND AGAIN, 
19:27:22 WE SHOWED YOU MAPPINGS OF WHAT OTHERS HAVE IN FREMONT, AND WE DON'T WANT TO 
19:27:22 OVERBILL.

19:27:26 THAT WOULD BE A POOR WASTE OF PUBLIC DOLLARS, SO WHEN NECESSARY, WE WANT TO 
19:27:33 BE SURE THAT WE CAN PARTNER SWAP  INCLINED FIBERS, SWAP INCLINED 
19:27:38 CONDUIT, LEASE SERVICES TO -- LEASE YOUR ASSETS AND SERVICES TO THE 
19:27:43 PRIVATE SECTOR SO THAT THEY CAN OPERATE THE NETWORK FOR YOU AND DELIVER 
19:27:45 QUALITY AND IMPROVE BROADBAND THROUGHOUT YOUR COMMUNITY TO 
19:27:46 BUSINESSES AND RESIDENTS.

19:27:55 WE CONDUCTED A SURVEY, AND THERE WERE 498 RESPONSES TOTAL, AND WE FOUND THAT 
19:28:02 THE MAJORITY OF THE RESPONSES WERE FROM HOUSEHOLDS, FROM RESIDENTS, THERE WERE 
19:28:10 460 RESIDENTS, 22 FROM SMALL TO MEDIUM ORGANIZATIONS AND 16 LARGE 
19:28:11 ORGANIZATIONS.

19:28:14 THIS WAS A FAIRLY GOOD TURNOUT FOR A SURVEY THAT WAS OUT AND ON YOUR 
19:28:20 WEBSITE AND THAT WAS MARKETED VERY STRATEGICALLY AND WIDELY BY STAFF 
19:28:21 THERE AT  FREMONT.

19:28:27 AS YOU CAN SEE, THE RESPONDENTS ARE MOSTLY TECHNOLOGY AND MANUFACTURING, 
19:28:31 WHICH IS AN AREA, A SECTOR WHICH IS GROWING SIGNIFICANTLY IN FREMONT AS 
19:28:32 WELL AS HEALTHCARE.

19:28:40 HEALTHCARE TECHNOLOGY,  EDUCATION, GENETECH NOLG, ALL OF THESE SECTORS 
19:28:49 WHICH MAKES UP, I WOULD SAY, 75% OF YOUR COMMUNITY AND YOUR BUSINESSES 
19:28:50 THRIVE ON BROADBAND.

19:28:58 SO THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT STUDY TO CONDUCT, AND A VERY IMPORTANT UTILITY 
19:28:59 YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE IT THRIVES.

19:29:07 ALSO THE SURVEY TOOK A LOOK TO SEE HOW MANY -- HOW PEOPLE FELT  THEIR SERVICE 
19:29:13 PROVIDERS, THE TWO INCUMBENT PROVIDERS MOSTLY ARE AT & T AND SPECIFICALLY IN 
19:29:16 A VERY LARGE WAY, COMCAST, THROUGH THEIR XFINITY SERVICES.

19:29:25 AND WE SAW THAT THERE WERE 368 OF THE 498 RESPONDENTS THAT TOLD US THAT 
19:29:32 THEIR MAJOR ISSUES WITH BROADBAND FROM YOUR INCUMBENTS AND SOME OTHER 
19:29:34 INTERNET  PROVIDERS, THAT THE COST OF THE SERVICES WERE TOO HIGH, THERE WAS 
19:29:40 A LACK OF COMPETITION, WHICH WE THINK THAT THE PUBLIC REALLY DOES NOT NEED 
19:29:44 TO BE EDUCATED MORE ABOUT WHO IS AVAILABLE IN THEIR SERVICE AREA, WHAT 
19:29:49 SERVICES THEY COULD OBTAIN, BUT RELIABILITY WAS ALSO A VERY BIG ISSUE.

19:29:55 SO THE NETWORK WE PLANNED FOR YOU IS GOING TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES IN 
19:29:55 PARTICULAR.

19:29:59 I WOULD LIKE NOW TO TURN IT OVER TO PRESTON YOUNG, WHO HAS WORKED WITH OUR 
19:30:02 ENGINEERING CREWS.

19:30:06 HE WAS THE PROJECT MANAGER ON THIS, AND HE'S GOING TO WALK YOU THROUGH A 
19:30:10 THREE-PHASED IMPLEMENTATION PLAN FOR BROADBAND FOR THE FUTURE ECONOMIC 
19:30:14 DEVELOPMENT AND IMPROVEMENTS IN QUALITY OF LIFE AND GOVERNMENT INNOVATION FOR 
19:30:14 FREMONT.

19:30:15 PRESTON.

19:30:18 >> THANK YOU, JORY.

19:30:22 THANK YOU FOR LETTING US HAVE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT THIS TO YOU 
19:30:22 THIS EVENING.

19:30:29 SO WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT ON THIS PARTICULAR SLIDE IS THE OVERALL 
19:30:30 NETWORK WHEN IT WOULD BE COMPLETED.

19:30:33 AND THE THREE PHASES, YOU CAN SEE PHASE ONE IS THAT LIGHT BLUE AREA.

19:30:36 PHASE II IS THE YELLOW, AND THEN PHASE THREE IS THE RED.

19:30:43 AND SO WHEN YOU BUILD ON PHASE ONE IS WHAT WE'RE CALLING A RING BECAUSE IT 
19:30:46 KIND OF CONNECTS EVERYTHING, THE CITY FACILITIES, LIKE THE MAJORITY OF THE 
19:30:53 TRAFFIC SIGNALS HAVE CAMERAS THAT WILL CONNECT FIRE STATIONS AND OTHER SENIOR 
19:30:57 CENTERS AND TEEN CENTERS TOGETHER, AND THEY'LL ALSO BE IN A RING SO THAT YOU 
19:31:00 HAVE A BETTER REDUNDANCY, AND THE NETWORK, IF IT GETS CUT IN ONE AREA, 
19:31:02 YOU CAN FEED IT BACK FROM THE OTHER AREA.

19:31:09 SO THIS IS JUST IN PARTICULAR PHASE ONE.

19:31:12 THE TRAFFIC CAMERAS ARE THE ONES IN YELLOW.

19:31:15 THE EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTER IS THAT HEARTBEAT LOOKING THING.

19:31:20 THE CITY FACILITIES ARE GREEN SQUARE, THE FIRE STATIONS ARE THE THINGS THAT 
19:31:21 LOOK LIKE A  FIRE.

19:31:25 AND THE ONE POLICE STATION, YOU CAN SEE RIGHT THERE IN THE MIDDLE.

19:31:29 AND ONE THING IS WHEN WE CONNECT ALL OF THESE THINGS TOGETHER AS PART OF THIS, 
19:31:34 WE USE -- A MAJORITY OF THIS WORK IS DONE ON EXISTING FIBER THAT EITHER THE 
19:31:39 I.T. DEPARTMENT OWNS, PUBLIC WORK OWNS THROUGH TRAFFIC CONTROLS OR WHAT OTHER 
19:31:44 MEANS THERE ARE, WE BUILD THE NETWORK SO WE KIND OF INTERCONNECT ALL THOSE 
19:31:48 TOGETHER AND BE ABLE TO CONNECT ALL THESE INTO ONE STINNETT WORK.

19:31:54 AND ONE THING THAT IS ALSO A GOOD THING ABOUT THIS NETWORK IS WE'RE PLANNING 
19:31:57 ON HAVING TWO SEPARATE CONNECTIONS FROM THE EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTER TO 
19:31:58 CITY HALL.

19:32:02 SO YOU'LL BE ABLE TO GET TO EITHER BUILDING FROM TWO DIFFERENT 
19:32:07 DIRECTIONS, AND THAT'S IMPORTANT DURING, YOU KNOW, ANY OPERATIONS THAT 
19:32:12 IS AN EMERGENCY IN NATURE, WHERE THE CONNECTION BETWEEN CITY HALL AND THE 
19:32:14 EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTER ARE CRITICAL.

19:32:19 IF IT'S A MAJOR EARTHQUAKE OR SOMETHING OF THAT NATURE AND ONE OF THE CABLES 
19:32:24 GETS CUT, YOU DO HAVE AN ALTERNATE PATH SO THAT SHOULD BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN THE 
19:32:25 CONNECTION BETWEEN THE TWO AT ALL TIMES.

19:32:36 AND THEN THIS ONE HERE, IF YOU LOOK AT THE WHITE ON THIS SLIDE IS PHASE ONE, 
19:32:41 THAT WILL BE  BUILT, AND THEN PHASE TWO IS THE BLUISH.

19:32:45 I SHOW PHASE ONE SO YOU KIND OF KNOW WHAT WE'RE GOING TO BE BUILDING OFF 
19:32:50 OF, AND ALL THE LITTLE CONNECTOR OR ALL THE LITTLE PINS ARE WHAT THE TRAFFIC 
19:32:55 CONTROLS WOULD BE, EITHER  CAMERAS THAT DIDN'T GET DONE ON THE FIRST ONE BUT 
19:32:59 IT WOULD CONNECT ALL THE TRAFFIC SIGNALS WITHIN FREMONT TOGETHER AND 
19:33:06 HELP THAT TRAFFIC MODERNIZATION PROJECT THAT'S BEEN GOING ON, AND IT WILL HELP 
19:33:11 THE -- ALL THE DIFFERENT PROJECTS GO ON TO TRY TO HELP MAINTAIN, ONE, BETTER 
19:33:15 TRAFFIC CONTROLS, BETTER TRAFFIC FLOW, AND PROBABLY THE NUMBER ONE IS GOOD 
19:33:16 TRAFFIC SAFETY.

19:33:21 WHERE YOU HAVE THE SMART TRAFFIC CONTROLS AND YOU CAN, YOU KNOW, HELP 
19:33:26 PEDESTRIANS BE AVOIDED BY CARS AND YOU CAN HAVE -- THERE'S ALL KIND OF 
19:33:30 DIFFERENT PROGRAMS THAT CAN GET PUT INTO THAT, BUT THEY ALL HAVE TO HAVE A 
19:33:34  FIBER-TYPE NETWORK BACKBONE AND BE ALL CONNECTED TOGETHER FOR THOSE TYPES OF 
19:33:34 SYSTEMS TO WORK.

19:33:36 SO THAT'S WHAT PHASE II IS.

19:33:45 PHASE THREE, YOU CAN SEE WHITE IS WHAT PHASE ONE AND PHASE TWO ARE, AND PHASE 
19:33:46 THREE IS WHAT WE CALL FOR REDUNDANCY.

19:33:53 SO THE RED DASHES OR THE RED PIECES OF LINES THAT YOU SEE ARE NEW UNDERGROUND 
19:33:57 CONSTRUCTION THAT CONNECT THE PIECES OF THE NETWORK TOGETHER THAT KIND OF 
19:34:02 PINGING OUT ON THEIR OWN, AND IT MAKES IT SO YOU HAVE VERY GOOD REDUNDANCY, 
19:34:07 ESPECIALLY FOR ALL THE TRAFFIC, WELL, EVERYTHING IN PARTICULAR, AND THIS 
19:34:12 ALSO GIVES YOU WAYS TO GET REDUNDANT INTERNET AND KEEP IT REDUNDANT.

19:34:19 REDUNDANCY AND DIVERSITY ARE TWO VERY IMPORTANT THINGS, ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU 
19:34:23 HAVE, YOU KNOW, YOUR OWN EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTERS AND YOU HAVE THINGS 
19:34:25 THAT ARE RUNNING ON YOUR OWN NETWORK.

19:34:31 AND AS YOU BUILD AND START SUPPORTING SOME OF THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT 
19:34:37 AREAS, WHICH DOWN IN THE WARM SPRING AREAS IS A BIG ONE, IT SHOWS THERE'S 
19:34:42 THREE PROVIDERS, BUT GETTING A GOOD FIBEROPTIC HIGH SPEED CONNECTION SEEMS 
19:34:45 TO BE A BIT OF AN ISSUE FOR SOME OF THOSE FOLKS DOWN THERE.

19:34:48 AND IT CAN GET VERY EXPENSIVE.

19:34:52 SO THAT'S ONE THING WE'RE RECOMMENDING AS PART OF BUILDING THIS IS IN 
19:34:56 SUPPORTING THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, IS TO FIND A PARTNER THAT WILL HELP TO BE 
19:35:03 ABLE TO ENGINEER, CONSTRUCT, AND MAINTAIN THIS NETWORK, AND ALSO HELP 
19:35:09 SUPPORT ALL OF THAT ANYWHERE THAT MIGHT BE BUILDING UP NEW OR MOVING IN TOWN 
19:35:13 OR ARE ALREADY IN TOWN BUT NEED BETTER INTERNET, THIS WILL HELP THE CITY BE 
19:35:15 ABLE TO SUPPORT ALL THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT.

19:35:24 SO THE COST OF ALL OF THIS WILL BROKEN DOWN BY EACH PHASE, PHASE ONE, YOU CAN 
19:35:30 SEE THE CONSTRUCTION AND THE EQUIPMENT AND THE BUILDING COSTS ABOUT 
19:35:31 $10,800,000 FOR THAT PARTICULAR BUILD.

19:35:37 THE EQUIPMENT COSTS INCLUDE ALL OF THE EDGE EQUIPMENT AND THINGS YOU WOULD 
19:35:42 NEED TO PUT IN IN A DATA CENTER TO GET FREMONT'S OWN INTERNET ACCESS.

19:35:49 THE BUILDING COST IS WHAT WOULD BE CALLED LIKE UPGRADING DIFFERENT 
19:35:54 BUILDINGS, PUTTING IN FIRE SUPPRESSION, BATTERY  BACKUPS, BACKUP GENERATORS, 
19:35:55 THAT SORT OF THING.

19:36:04 PHASE TWO, WHICH IS THE TRAFFIC SIGNAL MODERNIZATION PROJECT, IT'S ABOUT 
19:36:08 $11.9 MILLION FOR THE CON STRUCK, WHICH A GOOD PORTION OF THAT IS REUTILIZING 
19:36:14 THE SIGNAL INTERCONNECT CONDUITS AND UPGRADING THOSE SO THEY CAN HANDLE THE 
19:36:16 CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS FOR FIBEROPTIC CABLES.

19:36:19 AND THE EQUIPMENT COSTS INCLUDE DIFFERENT SWITCHES AND EVERYTHING ELSE 
19:36:23 THAT WOULD BE NEEDED TO BE PUT OUT INTO THE FIELD TO MAKE THAT NETWORK 
19:36:24 FUNCTION PROPERLY.

19:36:33 AND THEN PHASE THREE, WHICH IS THE REDUNDANCY OR FINISHING EVERYTHING OFF 
19:36:34 IS ABOUT $2.4 MILLION.

19:36:38 AND THERE'S NOT EXPECTED TO BE ANY ADDITIONAL EQUIPMENT COSTS AS IT'S 
19:36:39 JUST MAKING THINGS REDUNDANT.

19:36:44 AGAIN, THE BUILDINGS WILL BE ALL TAKEN CARE OF HOPEFULLY IN PHASE ONE, AND SO 
19:36:55 YOU CAN SEE THE TOTAL PRICETAG IS ABOUT $26.09 MILLION FOR ALL OF THE BUILT 
19:36:56 BROKEN DOWN BY PHASE.

19:37:01 SO IF YOU LOOK DOWN TOWARDS THE BOTTOM, WE DO TRY TO USE -- WHEN WE'RE 
19:37:05 BUILDING OUT THESE NETWORKS, WE TRY TO USE AS MUCH EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE AS 
19:37:06 POSSIBLE.

19:37:11 WE'RE UTILIZING ON CALTRANS ON 880, THERE'S FOUR FIBERS THAT THE CITY OF 
19:37:15 FREMONT HAS ACCESS TO THAT HAVE NOT BEEN USED YET.

19:37:20 SO ALL OF THOSE FIBERS SIGNAL INTERCONNECT EXISTING FIBEROPTIC 
19:37:23 CABLES, WE PUT ALL OF THOSE IN FIRST AND THE ONLY TIME WE DO NEW 
19:37:29 UNDERGROUND, WHICH IS THE EXPENSIVE PART, IS USED LAST.

19:37:35 THE REASON WE DO FIBEROPTICS IS BECAUSE FIBEROPTICS IS WHAT THEY CONSIDER 
19:37:35 FUTURE PROOF.

19:37:40 THE AMOUNT OF INFORMATION THAT CAN BE TRANSFERRED OVER ONE SINGLE FIBER IS 
19:37:41 ASTONISHING.

19:37:45 IT'S IN THE TERABITS WITH THE RIGHT EQUIPMENT BUT OBVIOUSLY THAT'S TOO 
19:37:46 EXPENSIVE.

19:37:51 BUP THE POINT IS THAT FIBEROPTICS MAKES THINGS FUTURE PROOF.

19:37:56 WHEN YOU WANT TO DO SMART CITY APPLICATIONS, THE ROUTING THAT'S BEEN 
19:37:59 PICKED AND USED WILL COVER MOST OF THE CITY WITH ANY TYPE OF WIFI NETWORK, IF 
19:38:07 YOU WANTED TO DO ANY TYPE OF PARKING -- WHAT DO THEY CALL IT, THE PARKING 
19:38:08 AVAILABLE TYPE APPS.

19:38:14 THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT SMART CITY APPLICATIONS FROM SMART BUILDINGS TO 
19:38:20 DOWNTOWN KIOSKS AND CITY-WIDE WIFI NETWORKS AND THINGS LIKE THAT.

19:38:27 SO THE RECOMMENDATIONS WE HAVE, ESTABLISHING AN ENTERPRISE FUND FOR 
19:38:30 MANAGING CAPITAL  INVESTMENTS, REVENUES AND CONTRACTUAL SERVICES, THAT MEANS 
19:38:37 THAT ANY MONEY THAT'S GOING TO COME IN TO GET BUILT TO BUILD THESE NETWORKS 
19:38:38 GETS MANAGED THROUGH A GROUP.

19:38:39 THE REVENUES WOULD COME THROUGH THOSE.

19:38:44 AND ALSO THE CONTRACTUAL  SERVICES WOULD BE ANY  P3 AGREEMENTS THAT YOU 
19:38:45 WOULD HAVE.

19:38:49 THEY WOULD BE MANAGED THROUGH THIS TYPE OF THE FUND.

19:38:54 AND IT NEEDS TO BE SEPARATE  FROM -- WHEN YOU START DEALING WITH THE 
19:38:57 TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND OTHER THINGS THAT YOU HAVE TO BE ON THEIR OWN 
19:39:00 SEPARATE SET OF BOOKS, AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THEY GET MANAGED 
19:39:01 SEPARATELY THAT WAY.

19:39:06 CONTINUE DIG ONCE PRACTICES.

19:39:10 THAT IS ALL THE POLICIES YOU HAVE IN PLACE, IF PRIVATE PEOPLE ARE WORKING 
19:39:16 IN THE PUBLIC RIGHT-OF-WAY, THAT THEY ARE ENCOURAGED OR NEEDED TO PUT IN 
19:39:20 EXTRA CONDUITS, EXTRA FIBER CABLES, WHATEVER IT IS THAT THE CITY IS DOING 
19:39:21 WITH THEIR DIG ONCE POLICIES.

19:39:23 MAKE SURE THAT THOSE CONTINUE.

19:39:27 EVEN GET INTO SOME DEVELOPER AGREEMENTS.

19:39:30 IF SOMEBODY IS GOING TO DO A BIG DEVELOPMENT, MAKE SURE THEY'RE PUTTING 
19:39:35 IN CONDUIT AND WAYS TO MAKE THE FUTURE OF FIBER FLOW AND WORK RATHER THAN 
19:39:37 HAVE TO COME BACK AND DO EVERYTHING AGAIN LATER.

19:39:43 REVIEW FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES AND TRAFFIC SIGNAL IMPROVEMENTS.

19:39:49 FREMONT HAS A VERY UNIQUE TRACK RECORD FOR GETTING A LOT OF TRAFFIC SIGNAL 
19:39:54 IMPROVEMENT GRANT MONEY, AND THAT'S FANTASTIC AND THOSE EFFORTS NEED TO 
19:39:54 CONTINUE.

19:40:00 THERE ARE ALSO A COUPLE OF OTHER FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES, A LOT OF FUNDS 
19:40:04 AND SOME OTHER GRANTS THAT FREMONT SHOULD BE ABLE TO GO AFTER TO HELP GET 
19:40:08 THE DESIGNED ENGINEERING WORK, SOME OF THAT STUFF DONE AND PAID FOR.

19:40:21 COMPLETE SOLICITATION AND SELECTION OF A PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNER.

19:40:24 THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT WOULD LOVE TO COME IN AS PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERS TO 
19:40:29 WORK WITH FREMONT TO ADD COMPETITION IN ESPECIALLY RESIDENTIAL AREAS, DOWN IN 
19:40:34 THE WARM SPRINGS FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, AND THOSE THINGS NEED TO CONTINUE.

19:40:43 IDENTIFY FUNDING FOR NETWORK ENGINEER TO MANAGE NETWORK IMPLEMENTATION.

19:40:43 SORRY ABOUT THAT.

19:40:55 COMPLETE A RECOMMENDED CORE BUILD TO CONNECT ALL CITY FACILITIES AND FIRE 
19:40:56 STATIONS.

19:41:00 IT'S VERY, VERY IMPORTANT THAT THE CITY OF FREMONT KIND OF TAKE ITS OWN 
19:41:04 NETWORK AND CONTROL ITS OWN DESTINY WHEN IT COMES TO ITS SERVICES AND 
19:41:08 WHERE IT'S CONNECTED, HOW IT'S CONNECTED, AND BEING ABLE TO REDUCE 
19:41:14 SOME OF THE OP EX BY NOT HAVING TO LEASE SERVICES TO EVERY BUILDING, BUT 
19:41:17 YOU CAN HAVE THAT AND MANAGE IT YOURSELF.

19:41:20 BUILD TWO DIVERSE ROUTES FOR CITY-OWNED INTERNET CONNECTIONS.

19:41:24 THAT IS, ALONG WITH THE DIVERSITY, THERE'S TWO DIFFERENT PATHS THAT WE 
19:41:29 CAN -- WELL, THERE'S ABOUT THREE NOW THAT WE'VE FOUND ANOTHER ONE EVENING, 
19:41:33 THAT THE CITY OF FREMONT SHOULD BE ABLE TO CONNECT INTO SOME OF THESE POPS OR 
19:41:36 DATA CENTERS AND GET THEIR OWN INTERNET ACCESS.

19:41:41 AND THEN ANOTHER BIG ISSUE THAT WE HAD FOUND WHEN WE HAD TALKED TO SOME OF 
19:41:50 THE DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS WAS DIGITAL LITERACY IN AND EDUCATION.

19:41:54 SOME OF THE POPULATION SIMPLY DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO USE TELEHEALTH THE WAY 
19:41:58 THEY SHOULD, THEY DON'T HAVE DEVICES, THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO APPLY TO GET 
19:42:04 SOME OF THESE LOW INCOME INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER BENEFITS THAT ARE OUT 
19:42:04 THERE.

19:42:05 THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO GET THOSE.

19:42:12 AND I THINK THE PANDEMIC REALLY HELPED SHOW THAT SCHOOL CHILDREN NEED WIFI 
19:42:16 AND THEY NEED DEVICES TO BE ABLE TO DO THEIR HOMEWORK AND HOME, ESPECIALLY 
19:42:20 DURING THINGS LIKE THE PANDEMIC, WHEN THEY CAN'T GO OUT, AND THOSE THINGS 
19:42:21 ARE LACKING IN SOME  AREAS.

19:42:23 AS THEY DO EVERYWHERE.

19:42:31 SO SANDY, I'M GOING TO TURN IT BACK OVER TO YOU.

19:42:33 THANK YOU.

19:42:33 >> THANK YOU.

19:42:38 THANK YOU, JORY AND PRESTON, FOR YOUR VERY DETAILED PRESENTATION.

19:42:42 AND I'D LIKE TO ALSO THANK ALL THE DEPARTMENTS THAT CONTRIBUTED IN THE 
19:42:43 DEVELOPMENT OF THIS PLAN.

19:42:48 WE REALLY APPRECIATE THEIR INSTITUTIONAL KNOWLEDGE, AND IT WAS 
19:42:48 INVALUABLE.

19:42:54 YOU KNOW, WITH THAT SAID, IN CONCLUSION, WE ARE ASKING COUNCIL TO 
19:42:58 RECEIVE AND FILE OUR STAFF REPORT AND PRESENTATION.

19:43:04 WE'RE ALSO ASKING COUNCIL TO ADOPT THE CITY-WIDE -- I'M  SORRY, ADOPT A 
19:43:06 RESOLUTION OF THE FIBER MASTER PLAN DOCUMENT.

19:43:13 AND THEN ALTHOUGH WE'RE NOT  ASKING COUNCIL FOR ANY GENERAL FUND DOLLARS, 
19:43:17 WE DO FEEL, AS MAGELLAN MENTIONED, THERE ARE A CONSIDERABLE NUMBER OF 
19:43:22 BROADBAND AND TRANSPORTATION GRANTS OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE CAN LEVERAGE TO 
19:43:25 FUND THE PHASES THAT WERE OUTLINED IN THE PLAN.

19:43:31 IN FACT, OUR LEGISLATIVE TEAM CONNECTED US WITH THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITY 
19:43:36 COMMISSION LAST MONTH, AND WE WERE ABLE TO IDENTIFY SOME OF THOSE UNSERVED AND 
19:43:42 UNDERSERVED AREAS IN FREMONT THAT WE CAN CITE AS EXAMPLES WHEN WE APPLY FOR 
19:43:44 THESE FEDERAL DOLLARS.

19:43:50 AS MENTIONED, WE WILL CONTINUE TO REVIEW OUR PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP 
19:43:57 RESPONSES AND POTENTIALLY USE THEM AS AN ADDITIONAL FUNDING SOURCE.

19:44:00 SO DAVID, IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE YOU'D LIKE TO ADD BEFORE WE CONCLUDE?

19:44:02 >> YEAH, THANKS, SANDY.

19:44:08 I JUST WANTED TO ADD THAT DEVELOPING THIS FIBER MASTER PLAN FOR THE CITY 
19:44:10 WAS THE FIRST OF ITS KIND EVER IN ITS HISTORY.

19:44:15 IN FACT, ABOUT A MONTH AGO, SEVERAL CITY STAFF AND COUNCILMEMBERS, 
19:44:19 INCLUDING MAYOR MEI, HAD THE UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO MEET CONGRESSMAN RO 
19:44:22 KHANNA ON A TOUR OF OUR IRVINGTON  DISTRICT.

19:44:26 HE HAD A CHANCE TO TALK TO A COUPLE BUSINESSES IN THE AREA ABOUT THEIR 
19:44:27 NEEDS FOR BROADBAND.

19:44:35 LONG STORY SHORT, AS PART OF THAT TOUR, THE CITY REQUESTED $1.5 MILLION TO 
19:44:40 PROVIDE WIFI BROADBAND SERVICES AS PART OF FREMONT'S FIBER MASTER PLAN TO 
19:44:45 STRATEGICALLY DEPLOY COMMUNITY WIFI ZONES IN THE CITY'S SIX COMMERCIAL 
19:44:46 DISTRICT PLAZAS.

19:44:47 SO IRVINGTON BEING ONE OF THEM.

19:44:51 ABOUT A MONTH LATER, WE RECEIVED MORE GOOD NEWS.

19:44:58 SENATOR PADILLA NOTIFIED THE CITY THAT HIS OFFICE HAS  REQUESTED $1.5 MILLION 
19:45:00 FOR FREMONT TO EXPAND ITS BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE.

19:45:06 AND TODAY, I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S A TOTAL OF $3 MILLION GOING THROUGH THE 
19:45:07 HOUSE APPROPRIATION APPROVAL PROCESS.

19:45:12 SO I THINK THIS IS A VERY  EXCITING FIRST STEP FOR THE  CITY.

19:45:17 LASTLY, I'D LIKE TO THANK DONOVAN LAZARO FROM ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT FOR 
19:45:21 ORGANIZING A TOUR OF THE IRVINGTON AND FUTURE DOWNTOWN DISTRICTS FOR THE 
19:45:22 CONGRESSMAN.

19:45:28 AS WELL AS GENEVA BOSQUES AND AMANDA GALLOW FROM THE CITY MANAGER'S OFFICE 
19:45:31 FOR THE WORK IN FILLING THE LONG APPLICATIONS FOR THESE FUNDS.

19:45:32 SO THANKS, SANDY.

19:45:34 >> OKAY.

19:45:40 WELL, THAT CONCLUDES OUR PRESENTATION, AND STAFF ALONG WITH MAGELLAN ARE -- 
19:45:42 WE'RE BOTH AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY  QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE.

19:45:47 >> Mayor Mei: WONDERFUL.

19:45:47 THANK YOU.

19:45:53 FIRST WE'LL GO TO OUR COUNCIL FOR CLARIFYING QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME.

19:45:56 CLARIFYING QUESTIONS, COUNCILMEMBER KENG.

19:45:58 >> Councilmember Keng: YES, MADAME MAYOR.

19:46:02 THANK YOU VERY MUCH, SANDY, JORY AND DAVID FOR THE PRESENTATION, AS WELL AS 
19:46:04 ALL THE STAFF  INVOLVED.

19:46:06  IN THIS PROCESS.

19:46:13 THIS IS VERY EXCITING FOR THE CITY TO HAVE THE, I GUESS, FIRST-EVER CITYWIDE 
19:46:17 FIBER COVERAGE -- FIBER MASTER PLAN AS WE KNOW THAT CURRENTLY WE  DON'T -- 
19:46:24 THERE IS POCKETS IN THE CITY WHERE WIFI COVERAGE IS VERY POOR, SO MY QUESTION 
19:46:28 IS, IF WE HAVE ANY ESTIMATE OF THE TIMELINES OF THE THREE PHASES?

19:46:36 >> WELL, COUNCILMEMBER KENG, WE REALLY DON'T HAVE A TIMELINE.

19:46:46 I THINK OUR FIRST APPROACH IS TO REACH OUT TO THE PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERS 
19:46:47 THAT RESPONDED.

19:46:53 WE HAVE A COUPLE IDENTIFIED IN PARTICULAR THAT WE'D LIKE TO START 
19:46:59 DISCUSSING HOW WE CAN LEVERAGE BUILDING OUT A CITYWIDE NOT ONLY MUNICIPAL 
19:47:04 NETWORK BUT ALSO ONE THAT BENEFITS THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF THE  CITY.

19:47:10 AND AS DAVID MENTIONED, THE  WALK-THROUGH IN THE DISTRICTS, PART OF 
19:47:15 WHAT OUR NEXT STEP WILL BE IS WE'RE WORKING WITH ONE OF THE PPP PROVIDERS 
19:47:22 TO JUST KIND OF OUTLINE HOW LONG WE THINK IT WILL TAKE TO BUILD OUT THE 
19:47:31  NETWORK WHEN WE RECEIVE THAT FUNDING BECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND WE HAVE TO MOVE 
19:47:33 PRETTY QUICKLY TO SPEND THOSE DOLLARS.

19:47:40 >> Councilmember Keng: GREAT, THANK YOU.

19:47:43 >> Mayor Mei: NEXT, CLARIFYING QUESTIONS, COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN.

19:47:45 >> Vice Mayor Salwan: THANK YOU.

19:47:50 YES, I APPRECIATE ALL THE ECONOMIC BENEFITS OF FIBER.

19:47:57 I WAS WONDERING, ARE THERE OPPORTUNITIES TO USE THIS TECHNOLOGY 
19:48:01 FOR REVENUE GENERATION, FOR PARTNERSHIPS OR SHARING WITH OTHER 
19:48:03 BUSINESSES SINCE WE OWN THE FIBER?

19:48:10 >> JORY, DO YOU WANT TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION?

19:48:10 THANKS.

19:48:11 >> ABSOLUTELY.

19:48:17 IN THE REPORT, YOU'LL SEE THAT THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITY THROUGH 
19:48:21 THE ROP PROCESS AND THE THREE PROVIDERS THAT SHOWED SIGNIFICANT INTEREST IN 
19:48:28 USING THE ASSET TO PARTNER WITH THEM TO CREATE A  PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP 
19:48:31 AND MONETIZE THE NETWORK THAT YOU'RE BUILDING.

19:48:37 AND IN THERE, YOU'LL FIND A  20-YEAR PRO FORMA, AND YOU'LL SEE THAT ON 
19:48:44 AVERAGE, AFTER THE RAMP-UP PERIOD OF THREE YEARS, YOU HAVE APPROXIMATELY 
19:48:51 $2.6 MILLION OF ONGOING -- YOU BREAK EVEN IN YEAR 4, AND OBVIOUSLY THROUGH 
19:48:56 THESE  PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS, YOU WON'T HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF 
19:48:58 OPERATING AND MAINTAINING THE NETWORK.

19:49:04 THIS WILL BE A REVENUE SHARE, WHERE THE CITY GETS 30% OF THE REVENUE AND THE 
19:49:12 PRIVATE PARTNER GETS 70%, AND THE PRO FORMA ASSUMES THAT THERE'S A 30% TAKE 
19:49:14 RATE FROM BUSINESSES AND RESIDENTS IN THE COMMUNITY.

19:49:18 >> Vice Mayor Salwan: WOW, THAT'S VERY EXCITING.

19:49:22 IS THERE A WAY TO MARKET THESE TO THE COMMUNITY MEMBERS OR DO THEY COME TO 
19:49:23 YOU OR HOW DOES THAT WORK?

19:49:30 >> WE ARE GOING TO -- WELL, WE ARE HOPEFULLY GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK 
19:49:37 WITH FREMONT, BUT I KNOW THAT MR. TAYLOR AND TEAM ARE GOING TO CONTINUE 
19:49:39 TO WORK WITH THESE PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERS.

19:49:41 THERE MAY BE MORE THAN ONE OF THEM.

19:49:47 THERE WILL BE ONE IN PARTICULAR, WELL, TWO IN PARTICULAR ARE FIBER PROVIDERS, 
19:49:48 ONE IS A  WIRELESS PROVIDER.

19:49:54 SO YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DEPLOY BOTH TYPES OF TECHNOLOGIES, DEPENDING 
19:50:01 UPON THE NEED, DEPENDING UPON THE NEIGHBORHOOD, AND, OF COURSE, THE 
19:50:02 SERVICE RATE AND  RELIABILITY.

19:50:06 SO YOU HAVE MULTIPLE PARTNERSHIP OPPORTUNITIES HERE.

19:50:13 AND THE PARTNERS THAT YOU SELECT WILL HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF MARKETING 
19:50:23 THE NETWORK, AND IT IS TO THEIR ADVANTAGE TO DO SO BECAUSE OF THEIR --

19:50:24 >> Vice Mayor Salwan: VERY EXCITING.

19:50:25 APPRECIATE IT.

19:50:25 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:50:27 CLARIFYING QUESTIONS, COUNCILMEMBER COX.

19:50:30 >> Councilmember Cox: THANK YOU.

19:50:37 THIS IS VERY EXCITING, AND I APPRECIATE ALL OF THE HARD WORK OF EVERYONE 
19:50:42 THERE'S BEEN INVOLVED IN BRINGING THIS PROJECT FORWARD, AND ALSO IT WAS GREAT 
19:50:46 FOR CONGRESSMAN RO KHANNA, AS WELL AS THE MAYOR AND MY FELLOW CITY 
19:50:52 COUNCILMEMBERS, TO TOUR THE DISTRICT 6, THE SENSATIONAL DISTRICT 6.

19:50:58 AND SO VERY EXCITED TO HEAR A LOT OF THE NETWORK.

19:51:06 ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I KNOW AS I TALK WITH OUR CONSTITUENTS, AND I KNOW THAT 
19:51:13 IN CERTAIN AREAS OF FREMONT THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED, THAT THE INTERNET 
19:51:14 JUST DROPS OFF.

19:51:21 I KNOW THAT'S GOING TO BE REALLY KEY IN MAKING SURE THAT SERVICE LEVEL IS 
19:51:29 REALLY HELD TO THE  HIGHEST STANDARDS OF THE 99.99%.

19:51:36 ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I THINK THERE IS SOME CONFUSION, AND TO HELP BE ABLE TO 
19:51:43 GET THE WORD  OUT, BESIDES IT'S REVENUE, I'VE WORKED FOR SOME OTHER 
19:51:50 COMPANIES THAT HAVE USED THE BROADBAND MARKETING, AND THEY HAVE LIKE 
19:51:54 DIFFERENT TIERS, AND THAT ADVERTISING IS POWERFUL AS PEOPLE VISIT OTHER 
19:52:04 BUSINESSES OR OTHER PLACES THAT YOU GET INFORMATION IN A SAFE STAGE BUT ALSO 
19:52:08 IT'S A GREAT REVENUE FOR SURE, SO I'VE SEEN THAT DEMONSTRATED IN REAL LIFE, 
19:52:12 AND PART OF THE TEAM THAT BROUGHT THAT FORTH.

19:52:20 ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I WANTED TO MAKE SURE IS THAT WHEN WE HAVE THE PUBLIC 
19:52:22 AND PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS, THE IMPORTANCE OF SEEING HOW WE CAN ALSO 
19:52:29 WORK WITH OUR LABOR COUNCIL, OUR BUILDING TRADES, ESPECIALLY WITH THE 
19:52:35 IBEW AND THE COMMUNICATION WORKERS OF AMERICA THAT ARE HEAVILY ENGROSSED IN 
19:52:41 THE SPACE OF THIS TELECOM, AND SEEING HOW THERE COULD BE SOME OPPORTUNITIES 
19:52:47 OF APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS, AS WELL AS WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BECAUSE YOU DO 
19:52:53 DRAW UPON A POOL OF QUALIFIED WORKERS THAT ARE ALREADY CERTIFIED AND HAVE 
19:52:58 THE EXPERIENCE TO BE ABLE TO CARRY OUT THIS MAJOR PLAN HERE.

19:53:05 AND JUST SEEING HOW THAT COULD ALSO BE AN OPPORTUNITY TO INCLUDE OUR ALAMEDA 
19:53:12 BUILDING TRADES COUNCIL AND OUR LABOR COUNCIL, SEE HOW THERE COULD BE SOME 
19:53:14 GOOD OPPORTUNITIES THERE TO UTILIZE THOSE EXPERIENCES.

19:53:21 AND ALSO, YOU KNOW, I KNOW THERE WAS A LOT OF WORK DONE AT OHLONE COLLEGE 
19:53:25 WITH OUR TECHNOLOGY, AND WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS THE RIGHT THING IN SETTING IT 
19:53:31 UP AS A SEPARATE ENTERPRISE FUNDS.

19:53:34 ONE OF THE THINGS I'M WONDERING IS AS WE LOOK FORWARD, YOU KNOW, IRVINGTON 
19:53:41 IS ANOTHER -- IS GOING TO BE ANOTHER BART STATION  THERE, IRVINGTON BART 
19:53:41 STATION.

19:53:48 AND HOW THAT'S GOING TO ENCOMPASS ALL OF THIS WONDERFUL FIBEROPTIC NETWORK.

19:53:55 I KNOW YOU HAVE THE FREMONT BART THAT THE LINES ARE THERE, BUT WITH THE 
19:54:01 COSTS INCREASING WITH THIS PROJECT AND ONBOARDING THIS ADDITIONAL NEW BART 
19:54:09 STATION OVER TIME AND IS THAT JUST ANOTHER SEPARATE PHASE OR I DIDN'T SEE 
19:54:10 THAT AS PART OF THE PLAN THERE.

19:54:20 >> SO COUNCILMEMBER COX, YOU KNOW, WE TRY TO TOUCH EVERY AREA WITHIN THE 
19:54:25 CITY THAT WAS IDENTIFIED, EITHER BY ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, THE ECONOMIC 
19:54:33 DEVELOPMENT TEAM OR THE DEPARTMENTS, AND SO THIS IS AN EVERGREEN DOCUMENT, 
19:54:40 SO WE CAN CONTINUE TO ADD FACILITIES AS NEW FACILITIES COME ONLINE, AND WHEN 
19:54:47 THAT BART STATION COMES ONLINE, WE CAN LOOK AT HOW WE CAN EXTEND OUR EXISTING 
19:54:55 FIBER INTO THAT FACILITY TO HELP DEPLOY POTENTIAL WIFI SOLUTIONS, ANYTHING TO 
19:54:57 KIND OF HELP THAT ENVIRONMENT, IF YOU WILL.

19:55:00 >> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.

19:55:02 GOT IT.

19:55:09 THAT WOULD BE GREAT AS WE MOVE FORWARD, I KNOW THIS IS EXCITING TO SEE THAT 
19:55:12 THIS IS A 20 -- MASTER PLAN.

19:55:18 ONE OTHER QUESTION I HAD WAS THAT AS WE HAVE THESE TRAFFIC SIGNALING 
19:55:24 MODERNIZATION PROJECTS BEING IMPLEMENTED WITH THE FIBEROPTIC PLAN, 
19:55:29 IS THERE OPPORTUNITY THAT THESE THINGS CAN BE CONTROLLED REMOTELY AS, I 
19:55:34 GUESS, IS IT LIKE AS THE FIRE POLICE CARS COME IN AUTOMATICALLY, THERE'S 
19:55:39 SOME SORT OF AUTOMATIC SIGNALING THAT WOULD TRIGGER INSTEAD OF HAVING TO 
19:55:44 HAVE SOMEONE MANUALLY MAKE THE CHANGE THERE IN A SENSE OF EMERGENCY?

19:55:51 I WAS JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND SOME OF THOSE FORWARD THINKING PODS THAT YOU 
19:55:55 HAD PUT IN YOUR WONDERFUL WORK, BUT JUST TRYING TO MAKE SURE WE'RE 
19:55:57 ARTICULATING IT WITH OUR FREMONT RESIDENTS.

19:55:58 >> SO I'M GLAD YOU BROUGHT THAT TOPIC UP.

19:56:08 WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH OUR PUBLIC WORKS DIRECTOR HANS LARSEN AND HIS 
19:56:13 TEAM TO HELP PILOT A PRE-EMPTION SYSTEM FOR PUBLIC SAFETY BUT PRIMARILY FOR 
19:56:19 THE FIRE DEPARTMENT, AND THEY'VE ROLLED PORTIONS OF THAT OUT THROUGHOUT THE 
19:56:19 CITY.

19:56:26 I'M NOT SURE AT THIS POINT, YOU KNOW, IF IT'S -- I KNOW THAT IT'S NOT LIVE, 
19:56:30 BUT THEY'VE BEEN TESTING IT ON AN ONGOING BASIS AND THEY'RE PRETTY 
19:56:35 EXCITED ABOUT, YOU KNOW, THE RESPONSE TIMES THAT THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO 
19:56:36 ACHIEVE THROUGH USING THIS TECHNOLOGY.

19:56:45 >> Councilmember Cox: SO IT'S STILL IN BETA TESTING?

19:56:47 >> IT'S STILL IN THE WORKS, YES.

19:56:48 >> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.

19:56:52 >> AND OBVIOUSLY AS MAGELLAN HAS IDENTIFIED, AS WE CONTINUE TO BUILD 
19:56:56 THIS NETWORK AND FILL IN THOSE GAP AREAS, THIS TECHNOLOGY CAN BE, YOU 
19:57:01 KNOW, SPREAD OUT THROUGHOUT THE CITY, SO OBVIOUSLY THE MORE FIBER WE  HAVE, 
19:57:06 MORE BANDWIDTH WE HAVE, THE MORE INTERNET OF THINGS THAT WE'LL BE ABLE 
19:57:07 TO DEPLOY.

19:57:14 >> Councilmember Cox: HOW IS THE SUPPLY CHAIN MARKET ON FIBEROPTIC MATERIALS 
19:57:15 AND EQUIPMENT RIGHT NOW?

19:57:23 >> JORY, CAN YOU ANSWER THAT QUESTION?

19:57:24 >> ABSOLUTELY.

19:57:27 WE HAVE SEEN A VERY LARGE  DEMAND, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE OF FEDERAL AND 
19:57:29 STATE FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES.

19:57:34 YOU ARE AWARE OF SB156, I'M  SURE, FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA, AND THE 
19:57:45  ON THE SUPPORT OF BROADBAND, THE STATE ITSELF FILLING A $2.3 BILLION MIDDLE 
19:57:49 MILE OPEN ACCESS NETWORK THROUGHOUT THE STATE ON CALTRANS RIGHT-OF-WAY.

19:57:53 OF COURSE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS ISSUING CLOSE TO ABOUT $96 BILLION, 
19:57:59 WE'RE GOING TO SEE ANOTHER $42 BILLION COMING OUT OF THE I IGA FUNDING OUT OF 
19:58:00 INFRASTRUCTURE CALLED BEAD.

19:58:05 AND OF COURSE THE REGULAR EXPANSION OF BROADBAND, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE OF COVID 
19:58:07 AND WHAT WE'VE ALL HAD TO  EXPERIENCE.

19:58:13 WHAT USED TO TAKE SIX MONTHS IS NOW TAKING 18 MONTHS, SO WE ARE 
19:58:20 ENCOURAGING ALL OF OUR SERVICE PROVIDER PARTNERS AND OUR CLIENTS TO BE SURE 
19:58:24 THAT THEY ARE PLANNING AND ORGANIZING AND ORDERING AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE, 
19:58:30 SO WE REALLY ARE PUSHING THEM TO GET THEIR DESIRED ENGINEERING DONE SO THEY 
19:58:33 KNOW HOW MANY MILES OF FIBEROPTIC CABLE THEY NEED.

19:58:40 AND THEN WORK THROUGH ALL THE REST OF THE BILL OF MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT 
19:58:43 AND OTHER ASPECTS OF THE NETWORK AFTER THAT.

19:58:49 OF COURSE YOU RAISE A VERY SIGNIFICANT POINT.

19:58:56 WE IN THE INDUSTRY THINK THAT IN A YEAR, THAT WE'RE GOING TO SEE A CHANGE 
19:58:58 IN THAT INTERRUPTION IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN.

19:59:01 WE'LL SEE PRICES COME DOWN AND I THINK WE'LL SEE AVAILABILITY IMPROVE.

19:59:05 KOCH COX OKAY.

19:59:08 

19:59:10 >> Councilmember Cox: THANK YOU THAT'S VERY HELPFUL.

19:59:12 I HAD ONE MORE QUESTION WITH COMMUNITY BENEFITS.

19:59:16 I KNOW I WAS GLAD TO SEE ABOUT THE DIGITAL LITERACY AND, YOU KNOW, 
19:59:21 DIGITAL DIVIDE AND INCREASING EDUCATION IN THAT PART.

19:59:29 IN THE RFP WITH THE  PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP, IS THERE ASPECTS OF IT 
19:59:34 THAT ARE FREE TO THOSE WHO CAN'T AFFORD TO HAVE THE BROADBAND SERVICE?

19:59:38 I KNOW SOME MAY BE FREE BUT SOME FOR COST AND IS THERE SOME ARRANGEMENTS 
19:59:43 THAT WERE MADE TO INCLUDE IN THAT PROPOSAL OR ARE THERE SOME OTHER 
19:59:47 COMMUNITY BENEFITS THAT YOU'RE ABLE TO SHARE RIGHT NOW, OR IS IT THAT IT'S 
19:59:48 STILL BEING NEGOTIATED?

20:00:00 >> WE ENCOURAGE ALL SERVICE PROVIDERS, ESPECIALLY GRANT FUNDING IS MADE 
20:00:09 AVAILABLE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OR EVEN IF IT'S COMINGLED WITH GENERAL FUNDS, 
20:00:10 STATE FUNDS.

20:00:12 THEY DO HAVE TO OFFER DISCOUNTED PROGRAMS.

20:00:19 AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS OFFERING AN EXPANSION OF THAT PROGRAM, AND IT 
20:00:25 IS A REQUIREMENT THAT EVERY ONE OF THE CITIES' PRIVATE PARTNERS WILL HAVE TO 
20:00:26 COMMIT TO.

20:00:28 >> Councilmember Cox: OH, THAT'S GOOD TO KNOW.

20:00:28 I APPRECIATE THAT.

20:00:28 THANK YOU.

20:00:32 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

20:00:34 AT THIS TIME, I WANTED TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE 
20:00:36 AUDIENCE BEFORE WE MAKE OUR COMMENTS.

20:00:41 I SEE KELLY.

20:00:42 WELCOME, KELLY.

20:00:43 >> THANK YOU.

20:00:50 I AGREE WITH IMPROVING DIGITAL LITERACY AND EDUCATION AND I THINK THAT WE 
20:00:52 SHOULD START WITH OUR OWN IT DEPARTMENT.

20:00:55 THE IT LEADERSHIP OF FREMONT SHOULD LOOK AT THE BEST PRACTICES, 
20:00:59 FAMILIARIZE THEMSELVES WITH THE HIGH-TECH CUTTING EDGE CITIES RIGHT 
20:01:02 HERE IN SILICON VALLEY LIKE MOUNTAIN VIEW.

20:01:05 I KNOW THAT SOME OF THE LEADERSHIP IS FAMILIAR WITH SANTA MONICA.

20:01:09 SANTA MONICA HAS MUNICIPAL WIFI IN KEY LOCATIONS.

20:01:10 THEY'RE FAMILIAR WITH LONG  BEACH.

20:01:20 LONG BEACH INSTALLED FREE PUBLIC WIFI IN CITY PARKS AND LIBRARIES AND 
20:01:22 THEY'RE EXPANDING THAT AS WE SPEAK.

20:01:30 THEY DON'T USE THOSE THAT FLEECE THE PARTNERS -- WITH EXORBITANT TELECOM 
20:01:30 FEES.

20:01:35 SO THIS A SHORT SIGHTED VISION THAT BENEFITS PLAIN MAINELY CITY EMPLOYEE, 
20:01:37 CITY IT AND CITY TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERS.

20:01:43 THIS PLAN OFFERS REAL FEW TANGIBLE DELIVERABLES ON A REAL SCHEDULE WITH 
20:01:45 REAL BEN BEN FITS FOR OUR RESIDENTS AND VISITORS.

20:01:50 THEY'RE ALL BEING LEFT OUT OF THE LOOP, THE FIBER LOOP, SO TO SPEAK, AND THE 
20:01:53 PROBLEM HERE IS THE LAST MILE OR THE LAST HUNDRED FEET.

20:01:58 YOU KNOW, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT OVER 100 LOCATIONS WITH BETTER TRAFFIC CONTROL 
20:02:03 SYSTEMS THAT ALREADY HAVE ELECTRICITY, ALREADY HAVE WIFI, ALREADY HAVE ALL 
20:02:09 THE INTERCONNECT, BUT THAT NEEDS TO BE SYNERGISTIC WITH SERVICING THE PUBLIC 
20:02:11 THROUGH MUNICIPAL WIFI HOT SPOTS.

20:02:17 THIS PLAN NEEDS TO DESIGN IN THE PUBLIC BENEFITS RIGHT -- STARTING RIGHT AT 
20:02:17 THE GROUND FLOOR.

20:02:22 YOU COULD PIGGY BACK ON TO THOSE EXISTING TRAFFIC SIGNALS.

20:02:27 YOU KNOW THOSE LITTLE YELLOW DOTS ON THE PHASE II MAP, THOSE 100 OR 200 
20:02:27 YELLOW DOTS?

20:02:34 THE CITY FIBER MASTER PLAN COULD DELIVER SERVICES AT THOSE LOCATIONS TO 
20:02:34 INDIVIDUAL USERS FOR FREE.

20:02:40 AND SERVE THOSE -- THE SCHOOL CHILDREN, THE SCHOOL CHILDREN THAT ARE NOW 
20:02:44 UNDERSERVED, YOU KNOW, ANYONE NEAR THOSE LOCATIONS WOULD BE SERVED.

20:02:51 NOW REMEMBER THAT SCHOOL CHILDREN REALLY NEED WIFI, AND THAT MEANS A 
20:02:54 SPECIFIC AMENDMENT NEEDS TO BE PROPOSED AND ADOPTED RIGHT HERE, RIGHT NOW, 
20:03:00 TODAY, TO INCLUDE MUNICIPAL WIFI, FREE, AT ALL THOSE TRAFFIC LOCATIONS TO MOVE 
20:03:07 IT UP FROM PHASE THREE TO PHASE TWO OR PHASE ONE AND NOT JUST SIT BACK, DO 
20:03:15 SIX SPECIALLY DESIGNATED EXCLUSIVE, YOU KNOW, PRIVILEGED TOWN PLAZAS AND SAY, 
20:03:18 OH, LOOK, WE'RE SOME KIND OF A CUTTING EDGE CITY HERE.

20:03:23 YOU KNOW, WE NEED TO GET OUT AND DELIVER THIS RIGHT TO THE PEOPLE THAT 
20:03:29 ARE WALKING DOWN THE SIDEWALK OR SITTING IN CITY FACILITIES OR SITTING 
20:03:36 IN PARKS, AND SITTING IN LIBRARIES, EVERYWHERE WE CAN AT MINIMAL 
20:03:37 ADDITIONAL COST.

20:03:38 THANK YOU.

20:03:41 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

20:03:45 AND I WILL NOW TURN IT BACK TO THE COUNCIL FOR CONVERSATIONS.

20:03:48 I HAVE SOME COMMENTS TO MAKE  TOO.

20:03:49 VICE MAYOR SALWAN.

20:03:51 >> Vice Mayor Salwan: THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR.

20:03:57 I GUESS I HAVE A QUESTION  REGARDING MR. KELLY'S COMMENTS, AND THEN 
20:04:00 COMMENTS AFTER.

20:04:06  -- COULD TALK ABOUT THE FREE WIFI AND THE PLANS FOR THAT, AS WELL AS THOSE 
20:04:11 OTHER FEEDBACK ABOUT THE PPP PARTNERSHIPS AND OTHER ALTERNATIVE 
20:04:12 WAYS OF LOOKING AT IT.

20:04:13 >> Mayor Mei: SURE.

20:04:20 >> I'M SORRY, COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN.

20:04:29 IN TERMS OF LOCATIONS, PART OF THIS PLAN DID REACH OUT TO THE DEPARTMENTS, 
20:04:36 WE DID IDENTIFY PARKS AND RECREATION'S NEED FOR WIFI AND PUBLIC FACILITY 
20:04:36 WIFI.

20:04:40 SO AGAIN, WE'RE GOING TO STILL TRY TO PURSUE SOME OF THOSE FEDERAL FUNDS TO 
20:04:45 DEPLOY THAT, AND OBVIOUSLY SOME OF THE FUNDING THAT COULD POTENTIALLY COME IN 
20:04:50 FROM OUR CONGRESSMEN AND SENATOR WILL ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE ISSUES AS WELL, 
20:04:57 BECAUSE AS KELLY MENTIONED, YOU KNOW, THE TRAFFIC SIGNALS ARE WHAT WE USE TO 
20:05:00 HANG THESE ACCESS POINTS.

20:05:05 AND IN CITY LIMITS AS WELL.

20:05:07 SO WE'RE STILL MOVING FORWARD.

20:05:15 WE ALSO HAVE SOME FUNDS WITHIN THE I.T. BUDGET THAT WE'RE GOING TO USE TO 
20:05:18 LEVERAGE -- TO EXTEND ACCESS POINTS OUT TO SOME OF THE LOCAL PARKS.

20:05:25 >> Vice Mayor Salwan: SO IT SOUNDS LIKE IT'S A RESOURCE ISSUE, WE NEED FUNDING 
20:05:28 FROM OTHER PARTNERS AS WELL, IS THAT CORRECT?

20:05:32 >> TO A CERTAIN DEGREE, BUT YOU KNOW, AGAIN, I THINK WE WERE WAITING TO 
20:05:38 COMPLETE THIS PLAN SO WE KNEW WHERE OUR FIBER ASSET WERE LOCATED SO THEN WE 
20:05:44 COULD IDENTIFY THOSE CITY FACILITIES AND TRAFFIC SIGNALS THAT DID HAVE 
20:05:51 ADEQUATE FIBER THAT WE COULD USE TO THEN DEPLOY THESE SOLUTIONS OUT IN THE 
20:05:51 PUBLIC.

20:05:58 

20:05:59 >> Vice Mayor Salwan: OKAY AND THEN REGARDING --

20:06:00 >> CAN I JUST ADD ONE MORE  THING?

20:06:02 I DON'T WANT THE PUBLIC AND CITY COUNCIL TO GET THE WRONG IMPRESSION 
20:06:03 ABOUT THE TECHNOLOGY.

20:06:12 PLEASE KNOW THAT A WIFI HOT SPOT WILL COVER ABOUT A 500-FOOT RADIUS, SO 
20:06:19 TRAFFIC SIGNALS AND WIFI ON TRAFFIC SIGNALS ARE VERY GOOD FOR SMART CITY 
20:06:21  APPLICATIONS, BUT THEY'RE NOT FOOD FOR DISTANCE LEARNING.

20:06:26 >> Vice Mayor Salwan: THANK YOU.

20:06:29 AND WHAT ABOUT THE WIFI, YOU KNOW, THE FREE WIFI?

20:06:31 IS THAT -- WHEN CAN WE MAKE THAT HAPPEN?

20:06:40 >> WELL, AGAIN, WE'RE BUILDING THAT INTO THE PLAN, AND WE'RE ACTUALLY 
20:06:49 LOOKING AT A FEW PARKS MAYBE NEXT MONTH THAT WE COULD START SOME OF OUR PILOT 
20:06:50 DEPLOYMENTS.

20:06:53 >> Vice Mayor Salwan: THANK YOU.

20:06:56 I'LL GO AHEAD WITH COMMENTS, MAYOR, IF THAT'S OKAY.

20:06:56 >> Mayor Mei: SURE.

20:06:59 >> Vice Mayor Salwan: I THINK THIS IS A GREAT PLAN.

20:07:03 I'M REALLY EXCITED, I KNOW IT'S A LONG TIME COMING AND A LOT OF FOLKS HAVE 
20:07:07 WORKED ON BRINGING FIBER TO FREMONT, SO I WANT TO COMMEND THE ENTIRE TEAM FOR 
20:07:08 TAKING THIS ON.

20:07:14 DURING THE PANDEMIC, WE REALIZED HOW IMPORTANT INTERNET IS, ESPECIALLY WITH 
20:07:17 ALL THE DISADVANTAGED FOLKS THAT WERE HAVING A VERY HARD TIME.

20:07:21 SO I THINK THIS FIBER WILL DEFINITELY BE A NET ASSET.

20:07:24 IT WILL ALSO BE A GREAT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT TOOL SO WE CAN BRING 
20:07:28 BIGGER BUSINESSES, BUSINESSES THAT REQUIRE HIGH DEMAND FOR THE INTERNET.

20:07:36 AND IT ALSO IS A -- WE CAN MONETIZE THIS BY BEING ABLE TO LET OTHER 
20:07:38 PARTNERS USE THE FACILITIES.

20:07:42 SO I THINK THIS IS A GREAT PLAN AND LOOK FORWARD TO SUPPORTING THIS AND 
20:07:47 THANK YOU, EVERYONE, FOR YOUR WORK, AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THE WIFI -- 
20:07:50 FREE WIFI IN THE FUTURE, SO LET'S KEEP THAT ROLLING.

20:07:51 THANK YOU.

20:07:51 >> THANK YOU.

20:07:53 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

20:07:54 NEXT IS COUNCILMEMBER SHAO.

20:07:57 >> Councilmember Shao: THANK  YOU, MADAME MAYOR.

20:08:01 TALKING ABOUT FREE WIFI, IT JUST OCCURRED TO ME THAT WE ALL KNOW THAT 
20:08:06 ELON MUSK IS PUSHING HIS STARLINK PROJECT.

20:08:15 RIGHT NOW THERE ARE OVER 2500 SATELLITES ALREADY IN SPACE, AND I 
20:08:19 JUST DID A QUICK GOOGLE AND FOUND OUT, OF COURSE, YOU KNOW, COMPARING WITH 
20:08:25 DOWNLOADING  SPEED, STARLINK CAN ONLY AFFORD ABOUT LIKE ONE-FIFTH OF THE 
20:08:28 DOWNLOADING SPEED OF  FIBEROPTICS.

20:08:31 BUT IT COULD BE MUCH CHEAPER.

20:08:34 AND THE TECHNOLOGY IS STILL ADVANCING.

20:08:42 SO WHILE WE'RE FOCUSING ON THIS PLAN, JUST KEEP IN MIND OF THE ADVANCEMENT 
20:08:46 OF THE NEW TECHNOLOGY, INCLUDING STARLINK.

20:08:53 MAYBE THE NEW TECHNOLOGY WILL OFFER US AN ALTERNATIVE THAT WOULD KEEP THE 
20:08:53 COST DOWN.

20:08:57 THAT'S THE FIRST COMMENT I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE.

20:09:00 I'M GLAD THIS IS AN EVOLVING DOCUMENT.

20:09:06 SO I'M SURE THAT IT WILL CHANGE WITH TIME.

20:09:14 THE SECOND COMMENT I WANT TO MAKE IS IN ADDITION TO PUBLIC AND PRIVATE 
20:09:20 COLLABORATIONS AND PARTNERSHIP, WE CAN ALSO EXPLORE PUBLIC TO PUBLIC 
20:09:23 PARTNERSHIP, FOR EXAMPLE, WITH FREMONT UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT.

20:09:31 WE KNOW THAT IN THE PAST FREMONT UNIFIED HAS BEEN NOT ONLY STRUGGLING 
20:09:37 WITH THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE IN TERMS OF INTERNET AND WIFI ON CAMPUS, BUT ALSO 
20:09:42 INVESTED A HUGE AMOUNT OF MONEY, UPGRADING THEIR FACILITIES.

20:09:49 SO IN THE FUTURE, MAYBE THERE'S A CHANCE FOR THE CITY AND THE FREMONT 
20:09:56 UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT TO WORK TOGETHER TO NOT ONLY USE EACH OTHER AS 
20:10:02 REDUNDANCY OR  BACKUP, BUT ALSO TRY TO SAVE SOME COST BY SHARING EACH  
20:10:03 OTHER'S RESOURCES.

20:10:05 SO THAT'S MY SECOND COMMENT.

20:10:07 THANK YOU.

20:10:10 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

20:10:15 SO WE'LL START WITH MY COMMENTS.

20:10:19 I WANTED TO SAY FIRST THANK YOU FOR THE DISCUSSION ABOUT THE P3.

20:10:22 I ABSOLUTELY AGREE ON THE DIG ONCE AND THAT'S WHY IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US WHEN 
20:10:27 WE'RE WORKING WITH INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS AND WE TALK ABOUT THE CAPITAL 
20:10:30 IMPROVEMENT PROGRAMS THAT WE ARE COGNIZANT OF THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE 
20:10:32 ABLE TO ADDRESS THOSE.

20:10:37 I KNOW THAT THIS PAST WEEK, THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF CONVERSATIONS AND THEY 
20:10:39 CONTINUED FOR THE PAST COUPLE MONTHS AND I'M PROUD OF THE FACT THAT FREMONT 
20:10:44 HAS BEEN WORKING TOGETHER IN TERMS OF ADVOCACY AND EARMARKING A LOT OF THESE 
20:10:50 REQUESTS, AND I THINK BY DRAWING OUR LEGISLATURES NOT JUST TO A LETTER BUT 
20:10:54 ALSO INTO ACTUALLY SEEING THE IMPACT ON WHERE THESE FACILITIES WILL BE HELPING 
20:10:58 OUR COMMUNITIES, ESPECIALLY WE HAVE BEEN AN ADVOCATE FOR NEIGHBORHOOD 
20:11:07 ACCESS, I THINK THAT THAT'S A KEY PART, AND I APPRECIATE BOTH CONGRESSMEMBER 
20:11:11 KHANNA AND PADILLA'S EFFORTS IN THOSE AREAS.

20:11:14 I ALSO WANT TO SAY WHEN IT COMES TO DIGITAL HEALTH, WE REALIZE IN THIS 
20:11:18 PANDEMIC HOW CHALLENGING IT CAN BE AND HAVING ACCESS, SO I APPRECIATE ALSO 
20:11:22 OUR FREMONT FAMILY RESOURCE CENTER, OUR SENIOR AGE WELL CENTERS IN TERMS OF 
20:11:23 SOME OF THE ACCESS IN  CLASSES.

20:11:27 I KNOW THIS WEEK ALONE, WE'VE BEEN PROVIDING SOME ACCESS AND TRAINING ON 
20:11:31 HOW TO USE DIGITAL DEVICES AND THAT'S SOMETHING WE CONTINUALLY WORK ON IN 
20:11:33 TERMS OF TRYING TO PUT PROGRAMS TO THAT.

20:11:36 AND THEN ALSO WORKING WITH FREMONT UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT, WE TALKED 
20:11:41 EARLIER ABOUT SOME OF THE CHALLENGES FOR THE AGING POPULATION, AND I KNOW 
20:11:45 THAT WE'VE HAD IN THE PAST SOMETIMES STUDENTS WHO'VE HELPED OUT WITH 
20:11:50 EDUCATING SOME OF OUR SENIORS OR SOME OF THAT PARTNERSHIP IN TERMS OF 
20:11:53 TECHNOLOGY, AND I'M GLAD WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON THAT AREA.

20:11:57 THE OTHER THING I WAS GOING TO SAY THIS PAST WEEK ALSO, I WAS ON A COUPLE 
20:12:02 CALLS, AND I KNOW THAT BLOOMBERG AS WELL AS U.S. CONFERENCE OF MAYORS ARE 
20:12:05 PARTNERING WITH MAYORS IN TERMS OF EDUCATING AND ALSO WITH NATIONAL 
20:12:09 LEAGUE OF CITIES IN TERMS OF SOME OF THE TRAINING IN TERMS OF HOW WE CAN 
20:12:10 BETTER APPLY FOR FUNDING.

20:12:15 AND IT IS IMPORTANT AS YOU MENTIONED EARLIER WITH THE NDIA BEAD FUNDING 
20:12:19 BECAUSE WE'RE LOOKING AT WAYS TO HELP WITH BROADBAND EQUITY AND ACCESS IN 
20:12:23 TERMS OF THE DEPLOYMENT, WHICH IS SO IMPORTANT AS WELL AS IN TERMS OF THE 
20:12:26 OPPORTUNITIES AS COUNCILMEMBER COX MENTIONED THAT WE'VE BEEN CHAMPIONING 
20:12:30 WORKING ON IN TERMS OF BUILDING THE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AND THESE TYPES 
20:12:32 OF ACCESS FOR CAREERS AND JOBS.

20:12:36 THAT'S SOMETHING THAT OUR MISSION VALLEY ROP AND ALSO OTHER PROGRAMS 
20:12:40 SUCH AS WORKING WITH OUR LOCAL COMMUNITY  COLLEGES WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO 
20:12:41 HOPEFULLY CHAMPION.

20:12:43 SO I'M VERY EXCITED ABOUT THE PROGRAM.

20:12:45 I THINK IT'S VERY COMPLETE.

20:12:47 I THINK THAT THERE'S A LOT OF OPPORTUNITIES.

20:12:52 I ABSOLUTELY WOULD LOVE TO SEE MORE ACCESS TO THE COMMUNITY, AND I 
20:12:56 APPRECIATE YOU CLARIFYING THAT WHEN IT COMES TO SOME OF THIS ACCESS, WITH 
20:12:59 ACCESS POINT, IT'S NOT FOR THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY RIGHT THERE ITSELF, IT 
20:13:03 DOESN'T REPLICATE ITSELF IN THAT TYPE OF REACH, BUT IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US 
20:13:06 ESPECIALLY SINCE WE'RE ONE OF THE LARGEST CITY, THE SECOND LARGEST BY 
20:13:10 LAND MASS, THAT WE DO PROVIDE THESE INTO SOME OF THE PARKS AND ACCESS, SO 
20:13:14 AS WE'RE LOOKING THROUGH OUR UPDATING OUR MASTER PARK PLANS AND THESE 
20:13:18 OPPORTUNITIES WITH OUR TOWN PLAZAS, THESE ARE WAYS THAT WE CAN START 
20:13:22 EXTENDING THAT REACH AND I KNOW THAT CERTAINLY TALKING TO FELLOW LOCAL 
20:13:27 ELECTS, WHETHER IT'S IN MOUNTAIN VIEW, SUNNYVALE AND OTHER LOCATIONS, THIS IS 
20:13:28 SOMETHING WE HOPE TO REPLICATE.

20:13:32 AND WE CAN WORK ON PROBABLY NOT JUST WHEN IT COMES TO APPLYING FOR THESE 
20:13:35 GRANTS, BUT I KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS THEY STRESSED WITH US IS THE ABILITY 
20:13:40 TO CONNECT OTHER NON-PROFITS OR AGENCIES AND TO BE ABLE TO TELL A 
20:13:44 STORY, SO WORKING WITH OUR FELLOW AGENCIES AND BUSINESSES AND SCHOOL 
20:13:50 DISTRICTS, I THINK WE'RE ABLE TO BE ABLE TO COMPEL THE UNDERSTANDING, I 
20:13:52 MEAN, THIS IS A LONG TIME COMING.

20:13:57 IN MY FORMER LIFE, MANY, MANY, MANY YEARS AGO, I LOOKED AT E RATE AND THE 
20:14:01 FACT JUST GETTING THE ACCESS TO THE SCHOOLS BUT NOW WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO 
20:14:04 EXPAND  IT, CERTAINLY TALKING ABOUT THIS MIDDLE MILE AND THE ACCESS, I 
20:14:08 APPRECIATE THE COMPREHENSIVENESS IN THE REPORT AND THE MAPPING AND HOPEFULLY 
20:14:13 THE OPPORTUNITIES TO CONTINUE TO ROLL OUT AS WE LOOK AT VENDORS AND 
20:14:15 DIFFERENT PARTNERS LOOKING AT THESE OPPORTUNITIES.

20:14:17 COUNCILMEMBER COX?

20:14:20 >> Councilmember Cox: YES.

20:14:28 I ALSO WANTED TO ADD, I KNOW THAT IN THE REPORT, THERE WAS A LOT OF STATE 
20:14:34 BUILDS, THE SBs, THE SB378, FOR EXAMPLE, OR AB41.

20:14:40 ALSO I KNOW YOU HAD MENTIONED LOOKING AT THE FEDERAL SIDE, I KNOW YOU'RE 
20:14:43 LOOKING AT THE STATE SIDE.

20:14:50 OUR DEAR FRIEND ASSEMBLYMEMBER ALEX LEE HAD ALSO ACHIEVED $15 MILLION JUST 
20:14:53 RECENTLY FOR THE CITY OF FREMONT, AND HE SITS ON THE BUDGET COMMITTEE, WHICH 
20:14:54 IS GOOD TO KNOW.

20:15:00 AND BE ABLE TO ALSO REACH OUT AND PARTNER WITH HIS OFFICE AS WELL SINCE 
20:15:03 HE REPRESENTS THE CITY IN FREMONT.

20:15:05 I JUST THOUGHT I WOULD ADD THAT.

20:15:10 IT LOOKS LIKE FOR TONIGHT, WE'RE JUST APPROVING THE MASTER PLAN, AND I THINK 
20:15:17 SANDY, YOU HAD MENTIONED IT WAS MORE SOMETHING THAT WE ARE GOING TO BECOME 
20:15:21 A LIVING DOCUMENT THAT WILL BE UPDATED AS NEEDED, AND I KNOW THE FUNDING PART 
20:15:26 IS KIND OF SEPARATE BECAUSE THAT'S JUST AS WE GO ALONG AND APPLY FOR THESE 
20:15:30 DIFFERENT GRANTS AND THINGS, BUT IT'S JUST TONIGHT THE ACTION FOR CITY 
20:15:34 COUNCIL IS TO JUST APPROVE THE MASTER PLAN, IS THAT  CORRECT?

20:15:39 >> YES, AND ALSO ADOPT THE  FIBER -- ADOPT THE RESOLUTION FOR THE FIBER 
20:15:39 MASTER PLAN.

20:15:41 >> Councilmember Cox: AND ADOPT THE RESOLUTION.

20:15:46 WITH THAT, I AM PREPARED TO MOVE FORWARD WITH ADOPTING THE MASTER PLAN 
20:15:53 FOR THE FIBEROPTIC AND ALSO THE RESOLUTION THAT REPRESENTS THAT.

20:15:55 >> Councilmember Keng: I WOULD SECOND THAT.

20:15:57 >> Mayor Mei: OKAY, FROM COUNCILMEMBER KENG?

20:15:58 IS THAT WHAT YOU WERE TRYING TO DO?

20:15:59 OKAY.

20:16:07 I APOLOGIZE, FOR SOME REASON MY VIDEO DOESN'T SEEM TO BE WORKING BUT JUST IN 
20:16:10 CASE PEOPLE ARE WONDERING, MY CAMERA IS ON ON MY SIDE.

20:16:15 ALSO, VICE MAYOR KENG SECONDED.

20:16:18 COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN, DID YOU HAVE ANYTHING ELSE YOU WANTED TO ADD?

20:16:20 I SAW YOUR HAND UP JUST A SECOND AGO.

20:16:24 >> Vice Mayor Salwan: NO, I JUST WANTED TO GO AHEAD AND MOVE THIS FORWARD.

20:16:28 SO IT GREAT THAT WE HAVE A FIRST AND A SECOND AND I SUPPORT THIS.

20:16:28 THANK YOU.

20:16:29 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

20:16:33 SO WE HAVE A MOTION BY COUNCILMEMBER COX AND SECOND BY VICE MAYOR KENG.

20:16:35 COULD WE GET A ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE?

20:16:36 THANK YOU.

20:16:38 >> Ms. Gauthier: YES, MADAME MAYOR.

20:16:41 COUNCILMEMBER COX, AYE.

20:16:43 COUNCILMEMBER SHAO, AYE.

20:16:46 COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, AYE.

20:16:48 COUNCILMEMBER JONES, AYE.

20:16:50 COUNCILMEMBER KENG, AYE.

20:16:53 VICE MAYOR SALWAN, AYE.

20:16:56 MAYOR MEI, AYE.

20:16:59 SO THE MOTION PASSES  UNANIMOUSLY.

20:17:02 THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

20:17:11 NEXT ON OUR AGENDA ITEM THIS EVENING IS ITEM 8A, AND THAT IS THE REFERRAL FOR 
20:17:15 THE DESIGNATION FOR THE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES ANNUAL CONFERENCE.

20:17:18 AND THAT'S COMING UP IN SEPTEMBER.

20:17:20 AND SO THAT IS FOR THE VOTING DELEGATE.

20:17:28 AND I KNOW THAT COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN SITS ON THAT AS A REPRESENTATIVE FOR 
20:17:30 OUR EAST BAY LEAGUE TOO.

20:17:39 SO ARE THERE ANY -- IT'S FOR THE VOTING DELEGATE TO BE COUNCILMEMBER RAJ 
20:17:43 SALWAN AND THE ALTERNATE IS MY ALTERNATE IN GENERAL FOR THESE LEAGUE 
20:17:47 OF CALIFORNIA CITIES THESE LAST TWO YEARS IS COUNCILMEMBER JONES.

20:17:54 SO I -- COUNCILMEMBER COX?

20:17:56 >> Councilmember Cox: THANK YOU SO MUCH.

20:18:02 I THINK IT'S GREAT GOING TO THE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES TO FIND OUT THE 
20:18:03 LATEST AND GREATEST HAPPENING.

20:18:09 I WAS JUST KIND OF UNDERSTANDING A LITTLE BIT WITH HOW THE SCHEDULE IS 
20:18:14 SET UP, BECAUSE I GUESS WHEN I JOINED, I GUESS IT WAS MORE OF A VIRTUAL LAST 
20:18:19 YEAR, AND IS THIS THE FIRST TIME THEY'RE DOING IT LIVE THIS YEAR FOR 
20:18:21 THIS ANNUAL CONFERENCE?

20:18:26 >> Mayor Mei: JUST TO CLARIFY, I THINK IT'S ALMOST BEEN IN THE PAST LIVE 
20:18:29 EXCEPT FOR THESE LAST COUPLE YEARS, IT'S BEEN VIRTUAL, BECAUSE OF THE FACT 
20:18:30 THAT THE PANDEMIC.

20:18:37 I DON'T KNOW IF THEY'RE DOING A HYBRID OPTION, USUALLY -- I BELIEVE IT'S IN 
20:18:42 PERSON BUT SOME OF THE OTHER CONFERENCES, BECAUSE OF THE, I GUESS, 
20:18:44 REMOTE ACCESS, THEY'VE PROVIDED SOMETIMES AN OPTION.

20:18:47 I GUESS OUR STAFF CAN LOOK INTO THAT.

20:18:50 I THINK THIS ONE, THEY'RE VERY EXCITED TO BRING EVERYONE BACK IN PERSON.

20:18:55 AND IT USUALLY ALTERNATES BETWEEN NORTH AND SOUTH, SO NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AND 
20:18:55 SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.

20:18:56 >> Councilmember Cox: OH, OKAY.

20:19:03 IS THERE LIKE A ROTATION THAT YOU DO EVERY OTHER YEAR OR SOMETHING LIKE 
20:19:07 THAT AND HOW I GUESS DO ALL THE COUNCILMEMBERS GET TO ATTEND OVER TIME 
20:19:08 AS A DELEGATE?

20:19:12 JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THAT PART OF THE PROCESS.

20:19:17 >> SO AS FOR A DELEGATE, WE HAVE A MEMBERSHIP AS A COUNCIL, AND SO ALL OF 
20:19:24 OUR COUNCILMEMBERS ARE WELCOME TO ATTEND, SO YOU WOULD BE ELIGIBLE AND 
20:19:25 WELCOME TO ATTEND.

20:19:29 AS FOR THE VOTING DELEGATE, IT'S FOR THE PURPOSE OF THE CONFERENCE, SO IT 
20:19:34 ONLY FOR THAT CONVERSATION THAT SOMEBODY WOULD BE VOTING NORMALLY IT 
20:19:38 IS MYSELF BUT THERE MAY BE EXTRANEOUS REASONS WHY I MAY -- I'M GOING TO BE 
20:19:44 AT THE CONFERENCE, BUT I MAY HAVE TO DEPART EARLIER, SO THAT'S WHY I'D ASK 
20:19:49 COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN, AS HE PARTICIPATES REGULARLY IN THE LEAGUE 
20:19:54 OF CALIFORNIA CITIES CURRENTLY TO BE MY ALTERNATE AND COUNCILMEMBER JONES HAS 
20:19:59 ALWAYS BEEN MY ALTERNATE FOR THE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES' MEETINGS IN 
20:20:00 GENERAL.

20:20:01 >> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.

20:20:05 MAYBE IT WOULD BE GOOD IF WE KIND OF HAD A ROTATING AROUND OR MOVEMENT 
20:20:08 AROUND OR CHECK-IN AND SEE THE AVAILABILITY FOR OTHERS THAT MAY WANT 
20:20:18 TO ATTEND THE CONFERENCE FOR THE DELEGATE AS WELL.

20:20:21 >> Mayor Mei: IT'S USUALLY THE PERSON THAT IS ON THE COMMITTEE, BECAUSE WHEN 
20:20:26 WE ASSIGN COMMISSIONS AND COMMITTEES, IT'S USUALLY FOR A TWO-YEAR TERM, SO 
20:20:29 COUNCILMEMBER JONES HAS BEEN ASSIGNED THAT BUT HE ALSO WILL BE IN THE 
20:20:34 PROCESS OF COMPLETING HIS TERM AS A COUNCILMEMBER.

20:20:38 SO THAT'S WHY I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE GOOD TO GET SOMEONE WHO WAS ALREADY 
20:20:42 REPRESENTING US FROM THE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES, EAST BAY, WHICH IS 
20:20:47 ON THE EXECUTIVE BOARD, WHICH IS COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN TO ALSO BE 
20:20:50  MY ALTERNATE.

20:20:55 WE ROTATE THE COMMISSIONS BASED OFF OF PEOPLE'S INTERESTS TO ATTEND THE 
20:20:55 COUNCIL MEETINGS.

20:20:58 IT A MONTHLY MEETING FOR LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES.

20:21:01 >> Councilmember Cox: GOT IT.

20:21:01 THANK YOU.

20:21:03 >> Mayor Mei: NO, NO WORRIES.

20:21:03 THANK YOU.

20:21:06 COUNCILMEMBER JONES, YOU HAD YOUR HAND RAISED TOO?

20:21:08 >> Councilmember Jones: THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR.

20:21:14 I JUST WANTED TO KIND OF REITERATE WHAT YOU JUST SAID.

20:21:19 HAVING BEEN AN ALTERNATE AND ATTENDING THE MONTHLY MEETINGS, I PERSONALLY 
20:21:24 THINK THAT IN ORDER TO BE A VOTING DELEGATE, YOU SHOULD HAVE SOME KIND OF 
20:21:28 INFORMATION REGARDING WHAT THE LEAGUE OF CITIES IS CURRENTLY UP TO, AND THAT 
20:21:30 INFORMATION IS OBTAINED BY ATTENDING THOSE MEETINGS.

20:21:36 I KNOW THAT WE HAVE PUT THIS OUT BEFORE AND THERE HAS NOT BEEN A LOT OF 
20:21:42 INTEREST IN PEOPLE WANTING TO ATTEND THE MONTHLY MEETINGS OR EVEN THE 
20:21:42  CONFERENCES.

20:21:46 I'M ATTENDING THE CONFERENCE EVEN THOUGH I'M NOT A VOTING DELEGATE 
20:21:49 BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN INVOLVED WITH THE LEAGUE FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS NOW, BUT 
20:21:56 I DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THOSE MONTHLY MEETINGS BE ATTENDED BY THE 
20:21:59 DELEGATE OR THE ALTERNATE IN ORDER TO BE CURRENT ON WHAT'S GOING ON AT THE 
20:21:59 CONFERENCE.

20:22:05 SO THAT'S JUST KIND OF MY 2 CENTS WORTH.

20:22:11 I DON'T THINK IT SHOULD BE SOMETHING THAT'S ROTATING AND HAVE SWUNL -- 
20:22:14 THEY'RE WELCOME TO ATTEND THE CONFERENCE AS WE ALL ARE, BUT AS A 
20:22:17 MATTER OF VOTING, I THINK YOU NEED TO BE CURRENT ON THE STANCE OF THE LEAGUE 
20:22:23 ON VARIOUS ISSUES BEFORE YOU ATTEND THOSE CONFERENCES AS A VOTING DELEGATE.

20:22:25 THANK YOU.

20:22:25 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

20:22:27 COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN.

20:22:34 >> Vice Mayor Salwan: THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR, AND THIS WOULD BE MY FIRST TIME 
20:22:39 BEING THE DELEGATE FOR THIS CALIFORNIA LEAGUE OF CITIES.

20:22:40 SO I'VE NEVER DONE THIS BEFORE.

20:22:43 I'VE BEEN ON COUNCIL SINCE 2013.

20:22:49 AND I APPRECIATE COUNCIL  TRUSTING ME WITH THIS PROCESS.

20:22:54 I WANT TO THANK RICK JONES WHO'S BEEN CARRYING THE FOR THE FOR A LONG TIME, 
20:22:57 SHOWING UP TO ALL THESE MEETINGS, AND I REALLY ENJOYED THE MEETINGS WE'VE BEEN 
20:23:05 HAVING LOCALLY AND I LOOK FORWARD TO REPRESENTING THE CITY AT THIS EVENT.

20:23:11 SO AS FAR AS THE PROCESS, I THINK, YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN ALREADY ON THAT 
20:23:14 COMMITTEE, I'VE BEEN THE ALTERNATE FOR THE  MAYOR, AND SO THIS IS NOTHING OUT 
20:23:15 OF THE ORDINARY.

20:23:16 THIS IS PART OF THE PROCESS.

20:23:20 SO I LOOK FORWARD TO BEING THE DELEGATE FOR THE FIRST TIME.

20:23:20 THANK YOU.

20:23:23 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

20:23:28 I ALSO WANTED TO CLARIFY FOR THE AUDIENCE, ALSO COUNCILMEMBER, THE 
20:23:32 LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES HAS PUT REGULAR TRAINING AND OPPORTUNITIES 
20:23:37 SUCH AS FOR THIS EVERY TIME BEFORE THE BREAK IN SUMMER, THEY USUALLY DO A 
20:23:43 LEGISLATIVE UPDATE PLAN AND SOME OF THOSE, WHILE MANY OF THE MEETINGS FOR 
20:23:47 EAST BAY LEAGUES HAS IT IN PERSON, SO HE'S BEEN DRIVING TO ALL THESE 
20:23:50 LOCATIONS THROUGHOUT THE EAST BAY FOR THE LAST COUPLE YEARS.

20:23:55 BECAUSE USUALLY IT'S A THURSDAY NIGHT MEETING WITH A MEETING AND A DINNER AT 
20:23:55 THE SAME TIME.

20:24:00 BUT A LOT OF THESE HAVE NOW PIVOTED IN THIS TIME PERIOD TO BEING ONLINE, SO 
20:24:05 THOSE ARE ALSO RECORDED, SO IF YOU WOULD LIKE, YOU CAN SIGN UP FOR THOSE, 
20:24:10 AGAIN UNDER OUR MEMBERSHIP AS A CITY, YOU CAN SEE THE ROUNDTABLES AND SOME 
20:24:13 OF THOSE ARE VIA ZOOM AND SOME OF THEM ARE ALSO RECORDED.

20:24:17 SO I WOULD WELCOME ANY OF YOU TO PARTICIPATE IN THAT.

20:24:22 IT WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT COULD BENEFIT ALL OF US, THE MORE PEOPLE 
20:24:24 THAT ARE ENGAGED, THE BETTER IT IS FOR ALL OF US.

20:24:25 SO THANK YOU.

20:24:30 SO THAT BEING SAID, I WANT TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY PUBLIC COMMENT ON THIS.

20:24:31 I DON'T SEE ANY.

20:24:33 I'LL CLOSE THAT.

20:24:39 IF I CAN GET A VOTE PLEASE.

20:24:42 >> Councilmember Jones: I MOVE THE MAYOR'S RECOMMENDATION.

20:24:44 >> Councilmember Shao: I'LL SECOND.

20:24:46 >> Councilmember Keng: I'LL SECOND.

20:24:49 >> Mayor Mei: MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER JONES AND SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER 
20:24:49 SHAO.

20:24:51 CAN I HAVE A ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE?

20:24:55 >> Ms. Gauthier: COUNCILMEMBER COX, AYE.

20:24:56 COUNCILMEMBER SHAO, AYE.

20:24:59 COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, AYE.

20:25:01 COUNCILMEMBER JONES, AYE.

20:25:04 COUNCILMEMBER KENG, AYE.

20:25:07 VICE MAYOR SALWAN, AYE.

20:25:08 MAYOR MEI, AYE.

20:25:11 SO THANK YOU SO MUCH.

20:25:12 THE MOTION PASSES.

20:25:23 AND NEXT IS ITEM 8.2, WHICH IS RESPONSE TO COUNCILMEMBER  KASSAN'S REFERRAL 
20:25:26 REGARDING THE INPUT FROM COMMISSIONS FOR MAJOR ROAD PROJECTS.

20:25:29 AND IF YOU'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE THAT.

20:25:34 I APOLOGIZE, I'M GOING TO LOG OUT REAL QUICKLY FOR ONE SECOND AND I'LL LEAVE 
20:25:37 VICE MAYOR KENG IN CHARGE FOR THIS SECTION WHILE I LOG BACK IN BECAUSE 
20:25:41 I'M HAVING SOME PROBLEMS WITH MY VIDEO, SO I WILL TRY TO SEE IF I CAN GET THAT 
20:25:41 TO WORK.

20:25:42 THANK YOU.

20:25:46 >> Councilmember Keng: THANK YOU, MAYOR.

20:25:52 SO WE WILL LET COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN PRESENT THIS REFERRAL, PLEASE.

20:25:55 >> Councilmember Kassan: I'M WONDERING IF STAFF SHOULD PRESENT SINCE THIS IS 
20:25:56 A REPORT BACK FROM STAFF.

20:26:01 >> City Mgr. Shackelford: GOOD EVENING.

20:26:06 GO AHEAD, AMANDA.

20:26:08 I HAVE TOO MUCH FEEDBACK.

20:26:10 >> GOOD EVENING.

20:26:13 >> Ms. Gauthier: WE HAVE A LOT OF MICROPHONES OPEN.

20:26:16 IF EVERYONE CAN MUTE UNLESS YOU'RE PRESENTING OR SPEAKING, THAT WOULD BE 
20:26:16 APPRECIATED.

20:26:16 THANK YOU.

20:26:19 >> Mayor Mei: I'M BACK AND I CAN ACTUALLY SEE MOST OF YOU AND MYSELF 
20:26:19 TOO, SO THANK YOU.

20:26:25 SO YES, IF YOU COULD MUTE YOUR MICS IF YOU'RE NOT ON, THAT WOULD BE GREAT, 
20:26:28 AND WE'LL TURN TO COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN TO INTRODUCE AGAIN HER ITEM.

20:26:33 >> MAYOR MEI, I WILL BE INTRODUCING THE ITEM AS IT'S A RESPONSE.

20:26:34 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

20:26:37 >> GOOD EVENING, MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL, PUBLIC.

20:26:46 AS MENTIONED, THIS ITEM BEFORE YOU IS A RESPONSE TO COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN'S 
20:26:49 REFERRAL REGARDING A PROCESS FOR INPUT FROM THE MOBILITY AND SENIOR 
20:26:55 COMMISSIONS IN RESPONSE TO PROVIDE INPUT FOR MAJOR ROAD AND 
20:26:56 TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS.

20:27:01 THE STAFF REPORT IN FRONT OF YOU KIND OF PROVIDES CONTEXT OF HOW FREMONT'S 
20:27:07 COMMISSIONS TYPICALLY OPERATE AND PROVIDE FEEDBACK OR DIRECTION TO THE 
20:27:14 COUNCIL AND STAFF AND THEN ALSO STAFF DID RESEARCH OF OTHER LOCAL CITIES, 
20:27:17 KIND OF THEIR OPERATIONS OF THEIR PROCEDURES AND COMMISSIONS IN 
20:27:19 PARTICULAR WITH TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS.

20:27:26 IT ALSO GOES FURTHER TO KIND OF DEFINE THE VARIOUS TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS 
20:27:30 THAT FREMONT IS INVOLVED IN AND HAS BEEN, HOW THEY USUALLY OPERATE WITH 
20:27:32 THE PUBLIC AND THE COUNCIL.

20:27:39 AND THEN IT ALSO PROVIDES ABOUT FIVE OPTIONS FOR YOU ALL TO DISCUSS AND 
20:27:42 PROVIDE FEEDBACK AND WITH THE RECOMMENDATION THAT STAFF IS REALLY 
20:27:47 LOOKING FOR A DIRECTION FROM THE COUNCIL OF HOW TO PROCEED FURTHER WITH 
20:27:47 THESE PROJECTS.

20:27:51 AND INPUT FROM THE SPECIFIC COMMISSIONS.

20:27:56 AND JUST WANTED TO NOTE THAT PUBLIC WORKS DIRECTOR HANS LARSEN IS ALSO 
20:27:58 AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS TONIGHT.

20:27:59 SO I'LL TURN IT OVER TO YOU.

20:27:59 THANK YOU.

20:28:08 >> Councilmember Kassan: WOULD IT BE OKAY IF I SAY SOMETHING?

20:28:10 SO, YES, THANK YOU.

20:28:17 I APPRECIATE STAFF PUTTING TOGETHER THIS VERY COMPREHENSIVE REPORT.

20:28:25 I DID WANT TO NOTE THAT WE GOT AN EMAIL FROM ANDREAS KADAVANICH ABOUT THE 
20:28:26 REPORT.

20:28:31 ANDREAS IS A MEMBER OF THE MOBILITY COMMISSION, AND HE WAS REALLY ONE OF 
20:28:35 THE MAIN PEOPLE WHO BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION THAT THERE WAS NO FORMAL 
20:28:40 PROCESS FOR SOLICITING INPUT FROM THE MOBILITY COMMISSION FOR MAJOR ROADWAY 
20:28:41 PROJECTS.

20:28:49 AND I PERSONALLY FEEL LIKE THAT'S -- IT WOULDN'T BE THAT DIFFICULT TO PUT A 
20:28:52 PROCESS LIKE THAT INTO PLACE, SO I REALLY APPRECIATED THAT HE DID BRING 
20:28:55 THAT TO OUR ATTENTION.

20:28:58 I ALSO HAD HEARD A WHILE BACK FROM COUNCILMEMBER COX THAT THERE MAY HAVE 
20:29:01 BEEN SOME MEMBERS OF THE SENIOR COMMISSION THAT WOULD HAVE LIKED TO 
20:29:05 ALSO BE CONSULTED, SO THAT'S WHY I THOUGHT THOSE TWO COMMISSIONS WOULD BE 
20:29:11 IMPORTANT TO GET SOME FORMAL -- HAVE A FORMAL PROCESS FOR GETTING FEEDBACK.

20:29:18 SO ANDREAS SENT AN EMAIL SAYING THAT WHAT'S IN THE STAFF REPORT MAY NOT BE 
20:29:22 TOTALLY ACCURATE BECAUSE THE COMPARISON CITIES THAT WERE USED WERE CITIES THAT 
20:29:27 DON'T HAVE MOBILITY COMMISSIONS, AND THEN HE GAVE THE EXAMPLES OF TWO 
20:29:31 CITIES THAT DO HAVE MOBILITY COMMISSIONS, BERKELEY AND DAVIS, AND 
20:29:42 THOSE CITIES DO SEEM TO HAVE A PROCESS FOR FORMALLY GETTING FEEDBACK ON MAJOR 
20:29:43 ROAD PROJECTS.

20:29:47 YOU KNOW, AS THE REPORT STATES, WE DON'T DO THAT MANY MAJOR ROAD PROJECTS.

20:29:54 THERE ARE PROBABLY ONE A YEAR OR MAYBE ONE EVERY TWO YEARS, SO I JUST THINK 
20:29:59 IT'S NOT SO MUCH TO ASK THAT WHEN WE ARE MAKING A MAJOR CHANGE TO OUR 
20:30:02 ROADS, THAT IT'S GOING TO HAVE AN IMPACT ON OUR CITY FOR PROBABLY 
20:30:06 GENERATIONS TO COME, BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S THAT MUCH TO ASK THAT WE HAVE A 
20:30:11 FORMAL PROCESS FOR SOLICITING INPUT FROM THOSE TWO COMMISSIONS.

20:30:19 SO I WOULD -- IN TERMS OF THE DIFFERENT OPTIONS THAT WERE PRESENTED, I WOULD 
20:30:30 LOVE US TO CHOOSE THE ONE -- NUMBER THREE, BECAUSE THAT SEEMS TO BE THE 
20:30:39 ONE THAT ALLOWS THOSE TWO COMMISSIONS TO FORMALLY PROVIDE INPUT ON THOSE 
20:30:39 MAJOR DECISIONS.

20:30:40 THANK YOU.

20:30:44 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

20:30:47 I ALSO SEE THAT WE HAVE A SPEAKER.

20:30:51 SO I'D LIKE TO INVITE THE SPEAKER TO SHARE THEIR COMMENTS.

20:30:54 WE HAVE WITH US THIS EVENING ACTUALLY A COUPLE SPEAKERS.

20:30:57 MONIQUE CHAPMAN FROM THE SENIOR CITIZENS COMMISSION.

20:30:57 WELCOME.

20:31:01 >> WELCOME.

20:31:05 THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR, COUNCILMEMBERS AND OTHERS.

20:31:08 I LOOKED OVER THE DOCUMENT THAT WAS PRESENTED, AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR 
20:31:09 SUPPLYING THAT.

20:31:11 I DO HAVE A COUPLE OF CONCERNS, ACTUALLY A FEW.

20:31:19 THE DOCUMENT SEEMS TO BE REALLY GEARED TOWARD MOBILITY AND NOT SO MUCH SENIOR 
20:31:22 CITIZENS.

20:31:24 THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT NEEDS FOR TWO DIFFERENT GROUPS OF PEOPLE.

20:31:30 WE HAVE A VERY RICH GROWING SENIOR COMMUNITY HERE IN  FREMONT, AND IT 
20:31:33 GOING TO BE VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE ADDRESS THEIR NEEDS.

20:31:38 VERY FEW OF THE SENIORS ARE GOING TO BE RIDING THE SCOOTERS OR THE BICYCLES, 
20:31:41 ALTHOUGH, YOU KNOW, YEA IF THEY DO, BUT THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE THE MAIN 
20:31:41 FOCUS.

20:31:47 ALSO, WITH THE STREET DIETING THAT IS GOING ON, YOU DID THAT VERY WELL, SO 
20:31:53 WELL UNTIL A LOT OF SENIORS ARE VERY CONFUSED ABOUT GOING TO THE STORE AND 
20:31:54 LOOKING AT THE STREET SIGNS.

20:32:04 SO IF WE WERE INVOLVED ON THE FRONT END OF INPUT FOR WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING TO 
20:32:08 DO, IT WOULD MAKE EVERYBODY HAPPY AND WE WOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE A CITY THAT 
20:32:13 JUST DOESN'T LOOK SO  LITTERED WHEN A SENIOR IS DRIVING FROM POINT A TO 
20:32:13 POINT B.

20:32:19 AS MISS KASSAN STATED, OPTION 3 SEEMS TO BE A PRETTY GOOD OPTION.

20:32:24 I DON'T WANT TO NECESSARILY, FROM THE SENIOR COMMISSION, TAKE LEAD BUT I 
20:32:29 THINK THE SENIOR COMMISSION SHOULD BE A PART OF ANYTHING THAT THE MOBILITY 
20:32:30 COMMISSION IS DOING.

20:32:36 AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.

20:32:36 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

20:32:39 NEXT SPEAKER IS STEVE SKALA.

20:32:41 WELCOME, STEVE.

20:32:46 >> THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL.

20:32:51 SO TRAFFIC AND ESPECIALLY COMPLETE STREET SOLUTIONS ARE UNIQUE IN THAT 
20:32:54 THEY ARE SOCIAL TECHNICAL CHALLENGES.

20:32:59 OTHER CITY INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS DON'T REALLY HAVE THE PHENOMENA OF 
20:33:04 SOME OF THE EXTREME EMOTIONAL RESPONSE THAT TRAFFIC SOLUTIONS DO.

20:33:11 ANYBODY CAN GOOGLE BIKE -- AND YOU'LL FIND UNIVERSITY LEVEL RESEARCH ON WHY 
20:33:16 PEOPLE ENTER SUCH PASSIONATE DIALOGUE OF WHAT SHOULD BE RELATIVELY 
20:33:20 STRAIGHTFORWARD AND SOMETIMES MINOR SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS THAT REALLY HAVE 
20:33:22 NO EFFECT ON CONGESTION OR ANYTHING ELSE.

20:33:28 AND ANYONE WHO THINKS WE CAN IMPLEMENT MAJOR TRAFFIC CHANGES IN THE COMMUNITY 
20:33:31 HARMONIOUSLY IS KIND OF NAIVE.

20:33:37 SO WHAT THAT MEANS TO ME IS THE CITY NEEDS TO PROVIDE LEADERSHIP AND GUIDE 
20:33:43 THE COMMUNITY ON CHANGES THAT HAPPEN AND THAT LEADERSHIP HAS TO START WITH 
20:33:43 CITY COUNCIL.

20:33:47 AND THE ONLY WAY I KNOW TO PROVIDE LEADERSHIP IS THAT YOU HAVE TO GET 
20:33:52 CLEAR INFORMATION, AND THE MOBILITY COMMISSION IS THE BODY THAT'S TASKED 
20:33:54 TO GIVE THAT INFORMATION AND VERY CAPABLE OF IT.

20:34:01 SO I THINK STRONGLY THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION AS A CLEAR 
20:34:04 WRITTEN RECOMMENDATION TO COUNCIL.

20:34:09 AS AN EXAMPLE, THE MOBILITY COMMISSION, THEY SPENT AN HOUR DISCUSSING MAJOR 
20:34:15 PROJECT LIKE PASEO PADRE ROAD DIET, TOOK A RECOMMENDATION AND VOTE BEFORE 
20:34:20 CITY ACTION, AND THEY WERE GIVEN ONE MINUTE DURING PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD TO 
20:34:22 GIVE THAT RECOMMENDATION.

20:34:24 THAT'S REALLY EXTREMELY INEFFECTIVE.

20:34:27 FRANKLY IT'S KIND OF A JOKE.

20:34:35 AND WE SAW THE COMMUNICATION MENTIONED FROM MR. KADAVANICH THAT RECEIVING 
20:34:41 RECOMMENDATIONS FROM TRANSPORTATION COMMISSIONS IS NOT NOVEL, IT'S 
20:34:42 STANDARD IN SOME OTHER CITIES.

20:34:47 SO I WILL REQUEST THAT COUNCIL ADOPT A BETTER MEANS THAN THEY HAVE NOW FOR 
20:34:52 FORMALLY ACCEPTING RECOMMENDATIONS FOR KEY ACTIONS, ESPECIALLY WHERE THE 
20:34:56 COUNCIL CHOOSES TO GET INVOLVED WITH DIRECT ACTIONS AND HAS TO GIVE A 
20:34:57 DIRECT APPROVAL.

20:35:04 I WOULD TEND TO LEAN TOWARD  HAVING ONLY THE MOBILITY COMMISSION GIVE THAT 
20:35:11 RECOMMENDATION, AS THEY ARE  TASKED TOWARD GIVING AND ADVISING ON 
20:35:17 TRANSPORTATION ISSUES MORE SO THAN ANY OTHER COMMISSION, AND THE ABILITY TO 
20:35:22 COORDINATE WITH OTHER COMMISSIONS PROBABLY WOULD BE BEST IF MOBILITY 
20:35:24 COMMISSION ONLY TAKE THE LEAD ON THAT.

20:35:28 SO THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO COMMENT.

20:35:28 THANKS.

20:35:32 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

20:35:34 THE NEXT SPEAKER IS JOHN HINDS.

20:35:37 WELCOME, JOHN.

20:35:40 >> HELLO, EVERYONE.

20:35:49 FIRST, THIS STAFF REPORT WAS EXCELLENT WITHITY ITS OUTLINES IN COMPARISON TO 
20:35:51 HOW WE WORK WITH OTHER COMMISSIONS, VERY HELPFUL.

20:35:53 I HAVE A FEW THINGS TO ADD, SOME OLD, SOME NEW.

20:35:59 IN AUGUST 2019, THE CITY HIRED A POLLING FIRM, FM3 RESEARCH, TO RUN A 
20:36:02 SURVEY OF LIKELY VOTERS IN FREMONT, MUCH AS THEY HAD DONE IN 2018.

20:36:08 BOTH SURVEYS ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT THE ISSUES FREMONTERS  CARED ABOUT MOST 
20:36:10 AND WHERE TO SET THE HIGHEST PRIORITIES FOR SPENDING.

20:36:12 THE RESULTS WERE CONSISTENT.

20:36:17 RESIDENTS PUT A HIGH PRIORITY ON IMPROVING THE FLOW OF VEHICLE TRAFFIC, 
20:36:21 WHICH MAKES SENSE AND SO MANY PEOPLE HERE HAVE LONG COMMUTES.

20:36:25 THEY PLACED MUCH LOWER PRIORITY ON IMPROVEMENTS IN BIKE SAFETY, 
20:36:28 PEDESTRIAN SAFETY, OR ACCESS TO PUBLIC TRANSIT.

20:36:32 BUT AT THE SAME TIME, THE CITY WAS DESIGNING ITS NEW MOBILITY COMMISSION, 
20:36:35 WHICH BECAME OFFICIAL IN OCTOBER OF THAT  YEAR.

20:36:37 JUST AFTER THE SECOND SURVEY.

20:36:43 BY DESIGN, THE COMMISSION HAD TWO OF ITS NINE MEMBERS REPRESENT DRIVING, 
20:36:47 TWO CYCLING, TWO WALKING, TWO TRANSIT AND ONE MOBILITY-IMPAIRED.

20:36:53 THIS DESIGN GAVE MINIMAL VOICE, JUST 22%, TO THE TRANSPORT MODE DEPENDED ON 
20:36:55 BY THE VAST MAJORITY OF FREMONT'S PEOPLE.

20:36:56 DRIVING.

20:37:03 BUT AS I MIGHT NOT BE A PROBLEM, THOUGH, IF THIS WERE A ONE-TIME TASK 
20:37:06 FORCE TO GATHER DATA AND SUBMIT A REPORT, THEN IT COULD BE HELPFUL TO 
20:37:08 HEAR SOME PERSPECTIVES FROM OUTSIDE THE MAINSTREAM.

20:37:15 BUT FOR AN ONGOING ENTITY, THAT SLANTED COMPOSITION IS A  PROBLEM, AND THE 
20:37:19 SIMPLEST WAY TO RESOLVE IT NOW WOULD BE TO ASK THE COMMISSION TO GIVE US THEIR 
20:37:24 FINAL REPORT BY YEAR-END, THEN DISSOLVE IT AS WE WOULD ANY OTHER TASK FORCE.

20:37:31 BUT IF WE WANT TO GIVE IT AN ONGOING FORMAL ROLE IN  DECISION-MAKING, WE 
20:37:33 NEED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT SKEWED COMPOSITION.

20:37:38 WITH NINE MEMBERS, EIGHT SHOULD REPRESENT DRIVING AND ONE SHOULD 
20:37:39 REPRESENT ALL OTHER MODES.

20:37:44 BECAUSE THAT'S WHO ACTUALLY LIVES HERE, AS SHOWN BY THE TWO SURVEYS THE CITY 
20:37:44 PAID FOR.

20:37:50 TO GIVE THE COMMISSION A BIGGER ROLE WITHOUT THAT CORRECTION COULD BE 
20:37:52 PROFOUNDLY  ANTI-DEMOCRATIC.

20:37:52 THANK YOU.

20:37:55 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

20:37:59 NEXT SPEAKER, ANDREAS  KADAVANICH.

20:38:04 WELCOME, ANDREAS.

20:38:07 THANK YOU FOR YOUR --

20:38:08 >> GOOD EVENING.

20:38:11 ANDREAS KADAVANICH, BIKE  FREMONT.

20:38:13 FIRST CORRECT I'M NOT CURRENTLY ON THE MOBILITY COMMISSION.

20:38:16 I WAS CHAIRING ONE OF THE PREDECESSORS OF THE MOBILITY COMMISSION.

20:38:26 I WANTED TO POINT OUT, THESE PROJECTS REQUIRE TRADEOFFS, AND TO RESOLVE A 
20:38:30 TRADEOFF, YOU HAVE TO MAKE A VALUE JUDGMENT, AND WHILE STAFF ARE THE 
20:38:37 EXPERTS ON THE TECHNICAL AND LEGAL ISSUES OF THIS PROJECT, THE CITIZEN 
20:38:40 REPRESENTATIVES, THAT IS, THE COUNCIL AND COMMISSIONS APPOINTED BY COUNCILS, 
20:38:43 ARE BEST PLACED TO MAKE THOSE VALUE JUDGMENTS.

20:38:48 AND THESE COMMISSIONS EXIST TO ADVICE COUNCIL, AND THAT IS, IN FACT, WHY I 
20:38:52 THINK IT'S IMPORTANT, WHEN COUNCIL MAKES THESE COMMISSIONS AND ASKS FOR 
20:38:55 THEIR ADVICE, THEY ACTUALLY CONSIDER THEIR ADVICE.

20:39:02 SO CURRENTLY, THE MOBILITY COMMISSION, AS STATED IN FREMONT MUNICIPAL CODE, 
20:39:07 IS SUPPOSED TO ADVISE COUNCIL, BUT THEY FREQUENTLY DON'T GET TO DO SO.

20:39:12 THE MINUTES ARE PUBLISHED TOO LATE FOR CITY COUNCIL TO CONSIDER THEM, AND THE 
20:39:16 COMMISSIONERS DON'T GET TO SPEAK IN ENOUGH DEPTH AT COUNCIL MEETINGS.

20:39:19 SO THE STATUS QUO, I THINK IS NOT ACCEPTABLE.

20:39:27 LOOKING FORWARD, IT LOOKS LIKE THE MOBILITY COMMISSION IS THE RIGHT 
20:39:30 COMMISSION TO ADVISE ON THESE PROJECTS.

20:39:33 I SEE THE POINT THAT IT AFFECTS SENIOR CITIZENS.

20:39:39 I ALSO SEE THE POINT THAT IT AFFECTS PLANNING, YOUTH, OTHER MEMBERS OF THE 
20:39:40 COMMUNITY AS  WELL.

20:39:46 I ALSO QUESTION IF THE FULL SENIOR COMMISSION WAS ACTUALLY INTERESTED IN 
20:39:51 SITTING ON HEARINGS LIKE THIS, OR IF HAVING A DESIGNATED REPRESENTATIVE 
20:39:56 ATTEND THE MOBILITY COMMISSION MEETINGS WHICH ALREADY TAKE PLACE ON MOST OF 
20:40:00 THESE PROJECTS WOULD BE THE MOST EFFICIENT OPTION.

20:40:07 OTHERWISE I DON'T ACTUALLY SEE I COULD STOP BECAUSE ALMOST ANY OF THE OTHER 
20:40:11 COMMISSIONS COULD MAKE THE CLAIM THAT THEY SHOULD BE CONSULTED AS WELL.

20:40:16 AND AGAIN, I HAVE SEEN IN THE PAST WHERE THE RECREATION COMMISSION ALSO 
20:40:21 HAD TO ACT AS THE BICYCLE ADVISORY COMMISSION AND MOST OF THE RECREATION 
20:40:24 COMMISSIONERS WERE ACTUALLY NOT INTERESTED IN THAT FUNCTION BECAUSE 
20:40:27 THAT WAS NOT WHY THEY SIGNED UP FOR THE RECREATION COMMISSION.

20:40:33 SOME OF THEM PROBABLY WERE INTERESTED AND THEY WOULD HAVE ATTENDED BUT THE 
20:40:34 FULL  COMMISSION, MAYBE NOT.

20:40:39 AND IN FACT, I WONDER IF THE WHOLE SENIOR COMMISSION IS, IN FACT, 
20:40:44 INTERESTED IN HOLDING  HEARINGS ON THESE PROJECTS AS IT IS RIGHT NOW.

20:40:49 THAT BEING SAID, I THINK THE MOBILITY COMMISSION IS WELL SUITED TO FULFILL 
20:40:51 THAT FUNCTION.

20:40:55 THE MUNICIPAL CODE ALLOWS THEM TO DO IT, IN FACT, ADVISES THEM TO DO THAT, 
20:40:59 AND THERE'S AMPLE PRECEDENT IN OTHER CITIES THAT HAVE TRANSPORTATION 
20:40:59 COMMISSIONS TO DO THIS.

20:41:01 THANK YOU.

20:41:02 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

20:41:06 AND I THINK -- I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY, IF YOU'RE COMMENTING ON THIS, YOU CAN 
20:41:09 ONLY SPEAK ONCE UNDER THE PUBLIC COMMENT.

20:41:12 AND I THINK THAT LEAVES KELLY ABREU.

20:41:14 STILL IS THE LAST SPEAKER.

20:41:15 THANK YOU.

20:41:22 >> I'D LIKE TO FIRST OF ALL CAUTION AGAINST THIS OVERRELIANCE ON POLLING 
20:41:27 THAT LOOKS AT, FOR EXAMPLE, ELECTED ELIGIBLE VOTERS OR WHATEVER.

20:41:35 FIRST OF ALL, POLLING WOULD HAVE NEVER GOTTEN YOU AN IPHONE.

20:41:41 IT TOOK STEVE JOBS TO PRODUCE IPHONES, AND POLLING WOULD NEVER GIVE YOU -- 
20:41:49 PEOPLE WOULD EXPRESS THEIR PREFERENCES AND AFTER A PANDEMIC AFTER ALL THE 
20:41:53 MEETINGS ARE HELD ON ZOOM AND ALL THE TRAFFIC ON FREEWAYS DECLINES, WE NEED 
20:41:57 A MUCH MORE NIMBLE APPROACH TO TRANSPORTATION BECAUSE THE 
20:41:59 TRANSPORTATION DEMANDS ARE VERY DIFFERENT TODAY THAN THEY WERE THREE 
20:41:59 YEARS AGO.

20:42:07 LIKEWISE, I HOPE THIS REFERRAL ACTUALLY GETS ACTION FROM STAFF, YOU KNOW, THE 
20:42:13 LAST REFERRAL THAT I REMEMBER FROM COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, IT'S THAT ONE 
20:42:19 ABOUT THE ANIMAL ORDINANCE, IT'S STILL HANGING OUT THERE SO HOPE YOU CAN GET 
20:42:20 AROUND TO ADDRESSING THAT TOO.

20:42:26 I SUPPORT OPTION NUMBER THREE ON THIS PARTICULAR THING, THIS PARTICULAR -- 
20:42:28 THESE -- THE MOBILITY COMMISSION OPTIONS.

20:42:32 AND IF YOU LOOK AT OTHER CITY AND COUNTY COMMISSIONS, THEY'VE GOT A LOT 
20:42:35 MORE ACTIVE FORUMS FOR DISCUSSION.

20:42:49 THIS THING IS A VERY -- STAGED, AND ATHEROSCLEROTIC COMMISSION THAT ONLY 
20:42:55 MEETS FOUR TIMES A YEAR AND THERE'S NOT THAT MUCH DISCUSSION, AND THE PRIORITY 
20:42:56 IS CONSENSUS.

20:43:02 THERE IS NOT MUCH DEBATE OR DISCUSSION.

20:43:03 AND THAT NEED TO CHANGE.

20:43:06 ONE WAY WOULD BE TO MEET MORE OFTEN.

20:43:12 ANOTHER WAY WOULD BE TO REINVIGORATE IT SOMEHOW THROUGH A MORE OPEN AND 
20:43:17 INCLUSIVE MANAGEMENT PROCESS.

20:43:24 OR MAYBE WE COULD SEND OUT PEOPLE FROM FREMONT TO GO VISIT ALL THESE OTHER 
20:43:29 COMMISSIONS THAT I JUST REFERRED TO, AND GO AND OBSERVE HOW THEY DO THINGS.

20:43:34 AND THEN COME BACK AND TELL US WHAT'S HAPPENING IN UNION CITY.

20:43:38 WHAT'S HAPPENING AT THE COUNTY LEVEL?

20:43:45 THERE'S A LOT OF, I BELIEVE, DIFFERENCES WHERE FREMONT IS CERTAINLY 
20:43:50 NOT DOING MOBILITY ISSUES IN A VERY OPEN AND INCLUSIVE WAY.

20:43:51 THANK YOU.

20:43:54 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

20:43:57 AND I WILL CLOSE THE PUBLIC COMMENT AT THIS TIME.

20:44:02 I SEE WITH HAVE SEVERAL COUNCILMEMBERS WHO WILL HAVE COMMENTS.

20:44:05 I ALSO WANTED TO NOTE, THOUGH, THAT IF PEOPLE ARE INTERESTED IN LEARNING 
20:44:10 ABOUT THE COUNTY POSITIONS, THERE IS ALAMEDA COUNTY TRANSPORTATION 
20:44:12 COMMISSION AND PEOPLE ARE WELCOME TO DIAL IN.

20:44:16 WE DO GET UPDATES FROM THE VARIOUS COMMISSIONS ON THOSE.

20:44:20 AND THEN ALSO A QUICK CLARIFYING POINT BEFORE WE CONTINUE THIS CONVERSATION, 
20:44:26 THAT WE HAVE  OPENINGS CURRENTLY ON THE MOBILITY COMMISSION, BOTH FOR A 
20:44:30 DRIVING REPRESENTATIVE AND A MOBILITY IMPAIRED REPRESENTATIVE THAT I'VE BEEN 
20:44:31 SEEKING APPLICATIONS ON FOR SOME TIME.

20:44:33 SO I JUST WANTED TO NOTE THAT FOR THE PUBLIC.

20:44:36 FOR THEIR INTEREST.

20:44:40 AND I SEE WE HAVE THREE COUNCILMEMBERS' HANDS RAISED, STARTING WITH 
20:44:43 COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN AND THEN WE ALSO HAVE COUNCILMEMBER JONES AND SALWAN.

20:44:45 >> Councilmember Kassan: THANK YOU.

20:44:49 FIRST I WANT TO APOLOGIZE FOR MISSTATING THAT ANDREAS IS ON THE 
20:44:50 MOBILITY COMMISSION.

20:44:57 AND IN HEARING THE COMMENTS, I WOULD LIKE TO AMEND WHAT I BELIEVE WOULD BE 
20:44:58 THE BEST CHOICE IN TERMS OF THE OPTIONS.

20:45:06 I THINK WE SHOULD DO OPTION FOUR, BUT COMBINE IT WITH OPTION TWO, BECAUSE I 
20:45:12 THINK THE INTENTION WAS FOR OPTION FOUR TO INCLUDE THE MOBILITY COMMISSION 
20:45:17 PROVIDING DOING A STRAW POLL AND PROVIDING COMMENTS BUT IT DOESN'T SAY 
20:45:17 THAT EXACTLY.

20:45:26 SO I WOULD REALLY LOVE US TO DO OPTION FOUR, WHICH HAS THE MOBILITY 
20:45:32 COMMISSION BE THE LEAD COMMISSION, BUT BRINGING THE SENIOR COMMISSION IN IN 
20:45:38 TERMS OF NOT NECESSARILY FORMALLY BUT GIVING SENIOR MEMBERS -- MEMBERS OF 
20:45:41 THE SENIOR COMMISSION AN OPPORTUNITY TO ATTEND THAT MEETING AND PARTICIPATE IN 
20:45:42 THAT MEETING.

20:45:48 SO I THINK I UNDERSTAND THE COMMENTS ABOUT REALLY FOCUSING ON THE MOBILITY 
20:45:53 COMMISSION AS THE LEAD, SO I'M NOW FEELING THAT NUMBER FOUR IS THE BEST 
20:45:59 OPTION, BUT BEING SURE TO ALSO INCLUDE NUMBER TWO WITHIN NUMBER FOUR TO MAKE 
20:46:08 THAT CLEAR THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT A STRAW POLL AND DOCUMENTATION SO THAT 
20:46:14 IS WHAT I WOULD LOVE TO SEE YOU ADOPT TONIGHT, THANK  YOU.

20:46:16 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

20:46:17 >> MR. MAYOR.

20:46:18 >> Mayor Mei:   YES.

20:46:23 >> IF I MAY I WANT TO RAISE ONE BROWN ACT CONCERN WITH THAT COMPENSATION AND 
20:46:27 THIS MAY IMPACT THE COUNCIL'S THINKING ON WHETHER OPTION 3 IS THE BETTER 
20:46:28 OPTION.

20:46:36 IF WE ARE TO INVITE SENIOR MEMBERS OF THAT COMMISSION TO THE MOBILITY 
20:46:41 COMMISSION AND VITAL THEM TO WEIGH IN VIA STRAW POLL ON AN ISSUE THAT WE 
20:46:46 HAVE NOW MADE IT WITHIN THEIR PURVIEW IN A SINCE.

20:46:52 BASICALLY WE WANT YOUR OPINION ON THIS TRANSPORTATION ISSUE, IT COULD BE A 
20:46:57 BROWN ACT CONCERN IN THE ISSUE THAT THE MAJORITY IS MAKING A VOTE, IT MAY 
20:47:00 CREATE THAT BROWN ACT REQUIREMENT THAT SINCE THEY

20:47:06 ARE VOTING ON A MATTER THAT HAS BEEN DELEGATED TO THEM BY THE COUNCIL THAT 
20:47:11 IT NEEDS TO BE DESIGNATED AS A BROWN ACT MEETING.

20:47:15 IF THAT LEVEL OF INVITATION IS PREFERRED BY THE COUNTY IT MIGHT BE 
20:47:19 BEST TO HAVE THEM DO IT AT THEIR OWN COMMISSION MEETING SO THAT WAY THEY 
20:47:21 CAN COMPLY WITH THE BROWN ACT.

20:47:23 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU FOR THE CLARIFYING COMMENTS.

20:47:30 COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN.

20:47:32 >> Councilmember Salwan:   THANK YOU, MADAM MAYOR.

20:47:37 YOU KNOW WE HAVE A CURRENT PRACTICE ON THE PLANNING COMMISSION WHERE THE 
20:47:42 PLANNING COMMISSION MAKES VOTES, AND THERE'S MINUTES TAKEN.

20:47:46 WHEN WE HAVE THAT PROJECT COME BEFORE US, THE ACTIONS OF THE PLANNING 
20:47:52 COMMISSION ARE DOCUMENT ED, AS WELL -- AND THEN IF YOU HAVE MORE QUESTIONS WE 
20:47:55 CAN ASK THE STAFF WHY DID THIS COMMISSIONER VOTE

20:47:59 THIS WAY OR THAT WAY, AND THE STAFF OFTEN WILL ARTICULATE THAT VERY WELL.

20:48:01 AND THE MINUTES ARE ALSO AVAILABLE.

20:48:07 SO THIS IS KIND OF AN EXISTING PROCESS BUT WHICH WE ARE NOT USING FOR 
20:48:09 MOBILITY COMMISSION.

20:48:16 AND THIS CERTAINLY COULD BE DONE WHERE WE GET MORE INFORMATION AND UNDERSTAND 
20:48:17 THE VOTES.

20:48:22 I DON'T WANT TO MAKE IT MORE COMPLICATED OR GIVE THE COMMUNITY THE 
20:48:26 PERCEPTION THAT THIS TRANSPORTATION BODY IS GOING TO DO MORE THAN IT CAN 
20:48:28 DO.

20:48:33 ULTIMATELY WE ARE THE ELECTED BODY, WE ARE ACCOUNTABLE TO THE PEOPLE.

20:48:34 AND SO THE BUCK STOPS WITH US.

20:48:38 SO I THINK THAT WE DEFINITELY SHOULD GET THE FEEDBACK.

20:48:44 WE DEFINITELY SHOULD PROVIDE A PROCESS WHERE THEY CAN ARTICULATE THEIR 
20:48:50 COMMENTS, AND IF WE DON'T HAVE THE MINUTES NOW LET'S DEFINITELY HAVE 
20:48:52 MINUTES AND GET THE INFORMATION NOTED DOWN.

20:48:55 SO THAT'S KIND OF WHAT I'M THINKING RIGHT NOW.

20:48:58 I'M OFTEN TO OTHER FEED BACK, THANKS.

20:48:58 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

20:49:00 I ALSO HAVE COUNCILMEMBER JONES.

20:49:03 >> Councilmember Jones:   THANK YOU, MADAM MAYOR.

20:49:05 I AGREE WITH COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN.

20:49:09 I THINK NOW, WE AS YOU SAID, WE OBTAIN INFORMATION FROM THE PLANNING 
20:49:13 COMMISSION ON PROJECTS THAT WE'RE VOTING ON.

20:49:21 DO WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO OBTAIN THE MINUTES FROM A MOBILITY COMMISSION 
20:49:26 MEETING, AND, YOU KNOW, AS MR. LARSON BROUGHT UP WHEN THIS WAS INITIALLY 
20:49:29  PROPOSED, REALLY, THE MAJOR PROJECTS ARE

20:49:32 PROBABLY TWO A  YEAR.

20:49:37 AND SO YOU KNOW THERE'S AMPLE TIME WHEN YOU HAVE FOUR MEETINGS A YEAR THERE IS 
20:49:40 AMPLE TIME FOR THE MOBILITY COMMISSION TO WEIGH IN.

20:49:45 BUT MAYBE IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO INCLUDE THE MINUTES FROM THEIR MEETING 
20:49:50 WITH THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS OR THEIR ADVICE, AND TO THE AGENDA ITEM, AND 
20:49:54 HAVE THAT AS PART OF THE AGENDA THAT WE ALL HAVE ACCESS

20:49:54 TO.

20:49:57 AND WE CAN MAKE AN INFORMED DECISION ON THAT.

20:50:02 AND IF THEY WANT TO HAVE THE CHAIR OF THE MOBILITY COMMISSION ATTEND COUNCIL 
20:50:08 MEETING TO OFFER A PERSPECTIVE, THEN BE AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONING.

20:50:11 BUT I THINK WE PRETTY MUCH DO THAT NOW.

20:50:16 SO I DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS  ABOUT, YOU KNOW, INVOLVING A LOT OF OTHER 
20:50:20 COMMISSIONS IN WHAT THEIR ROLE EXACTLY IS AS COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN SAID, 
20:50:22 ULTIMATELY THE BUCK STOPS WITH US.

20:50:30 SO, YOU KNOW -- BUT I UNDERSTAND THE NEED FOR THE INPUT AS WELL.

20:50:35 BUT IF WE COULD GET THAT, RATHER THAN HAVING, AS WE'VE HAD IN THE PAST, 
20:50:40 EVERYBODY CALLING IN AND I KNOW THERE'S BEEN SOME CONCERNS ABOUT WELL MAYBE I 
20:50:43 ONLY GET A MINUTE, MAYBE I GET TWO MINUTES, MAYBE

20:50:46 I GET WHOLE THREE MINUTES, WHATEVER IT TURNS OUT TO BE.

20:50:50 BUT IF WE HAVE A WRITTEN REPORT THAT'S AVAILABLE WITH THE AGENDA I THINK THAT 
20:50:56 WOULD BE A LOT CLEANER, WE WOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO REVIEW THAT REPORT, ASK 
20:50:58 QUESTIONS FROM THE REPRESENTATIVE FROM THAT

20:51:00 COMMISSION WHO IS ACTUALLY ATTENDING THE MEETING.

20:51:05 THAT I THINK TOO AND STAFF CAN CLARIFY THIS, IT WOULD CUT DOWN ON THE AMOUNT 
20:51:08 OF STAFF TIME NEEDED TO COORDINATE ALL THESE EFFORTS BETWEEN THE COMMISSION 
20:51:10 AND THE COUNCIL.

20:51:12 IS THAT CORRECT?

20:51:18 ANYBODY?

20:51:26 >> Mayor Mei:  I'LL SAY SPEAKING OF STAFF, WE HAVE QUITE A FAW SPEAKERS 
20:51:27 STILL.

20:51:31 WE ARE DUE FOR A BREAK FOR OUR STENO CAPTIONER.

20:51:34 THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN AT 8:30.

20:51:38 IF WE ARE GOING TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION FOR A WHILE I'LL NEED TO 
20:51:43 TAKE THE BREAK TO BE FAIR TO OUR STENO CAPTIONER.

20:51:47 >> Councilmember Kassan:   IF I ASK A CLARIFYING QUESTION OR CAN I WAIT 
20:51:49 UNTIL AFTER THE BREAK IF THAT'S BETTER.

20:51:53 I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT THE CITY ATTORNEY SAID, SO I WAS WANTING TO -- 
20:51:57 BUT MAYBE -- LET'S JUST WAIT UNTIL AFTER THE BREAK.

20:52:01 >> Mayor Mei:   YES, BECAUSE I THINK THIS IS GOING TO BE MORE THAN FIVE 
20:52:05 MINUTE DISCUSSION BEING THAT THERE ARE FOUR HANDS ARE RAISED.

20:52:08 I'M GOING TO TAKE A FIVE-MINUTE BREAK AND THEN WE'LL RETURN.

20:52:09 THANK YOU.

20:58:45 [ RECESS ]

20:58:50 >> Mayor Mei: HI, WE'RE BACK AGAIN WE'LL RETURN TO THE COUNCILMEMBERS WHO 
20:58:53 HAD THEIR HANDS RAISED.

20:58:58 AND I HAVE NEXT AS COUNCILMEMBER JONES -- SORRY I THINK THE ORDER IS NOW 
20:59:01 CHANGED AGAIN.

20:59:04 COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN I THINK YOU WERE TALKING AT THAT TIME.

20:59:07 >> Councilmember Kassan:   FIRST I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT THE THINGS THAT 
20:59:11 COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN AND JONES SAID, WE DON'T CURRENTLY DO THAT.

20:59:14 WHAT'S BEING PROPOSED TONIGHT IS EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

20:59:20 IT'S HAVING AN OPPORTUNITY -- A FORMAL OPPORTUNITY FOR THE MOBILITY 
20:59:23 COMMISSION TO DO A STRAW POLL AND GIVE COMMENTS.

20:59:25 THAT'S NOT CURRENTLY WHAT HAPPENS.

20:59:29 SO THAT WHAT YOU SAID COUNCILMEMBER JONES THAT WE ALREADY DO, IS NOT WHAT 
20:59:30 WE ALREADY DO.

20:59:32 THAT'S WHAT'S BEING PROPOSED TONIGHT.

20:59:34 SO I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THAT.

20:59:41 AND THEN I ALSO WANTED TO CLARIFY, RAFAEL, WHAT YOU WERE SAYING ABOUT, I 
20:59:45 DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THAT YOU WERE SAYING THAT IF THE MEMBERS OF THE SENIOR 
20:59:48 COMMISSION WERE INVITED TO THE MEETING, THAT SOMEHOW

20:59:56 THAT WOULD HAVE A DIFFERENT EFFECT ON THE THE BROWN ACT REQUIREMENTS.

20:59:57 COULD YOU SAY MORE ABOUT THAT?

20:59:58 >> YES.

21:00:05 SO AS THE COUNCIL'S AWARE, EVERY ADVISORY BODY WITHIN THE CITY IF A 
21:00:09 MAJORITY MEMBERS ARE GOING TO MEET WITH MATTERS -- TO DISCUSS A MATTER WITHIN 
21:00:13 THEIR PURVIEW THEY HAVE TO PUT TOGETHER A AGENDA, POST

21:00:16 THE AGENDA AS REQUIRED UNDER THE BROWN ACT BEFORE THEY ARE ABLE TO DELIBERATE 
21:00:17 ON THAT ACTION.

21:00:23 SO IF FOR EXAMPLE, THE CITY COUNCIL SAYS TONIGHT, AS A FOLLOW-MAKING BODY, 
21:00:30 WE WANT THE SENIOR ADVISORY COMMITTEE BODY MEMBERS TO ADVISE CITY COUNCIL ON 
21:00:32 UNIQUE TRANSPORTATION  MATTERS.

21:00:37 THAT IS THE POLICY DIRECTION, SO IT IS WITHIN THE POLICY OF THE SENIOR 
21:00:38 ADVISORY COMMITTEE.

21:00:42 IF IT'S WITHIN THAT PURVIEW IF A MAJORITY OF THEM NOW MEET TO DISCUSS 
21:00:44 THAT TOPIC IT HAS TO BE AGENDIZED.

21:00:49 SO IF A MAJORITY WERE TO SHOW UP AT THE MOBILITY COMMISSION FOR EXAMPLE FOR 
21:00:54 THEM TO PARTICIPATE AT THAT MEETING THEY WOULD HAVE HAD TO AGENDIZE THEIR 
21:00:55 PARTICIPATION.

21:01:00 OTHERWISE THEIR PARTICIPATION WOULD TECHNICALLY VIOLATE THE BROWN ACT.

21:01:05 SO I JUST WANTED TO MAKE THE COUNCIL AWARE THAT IF WE ARE ENCOURAGING THAT, 
21:01:11 IT WOULD CREATE THAT ISSUE AND IT MAY FORMULATE A DIFFERENT ISSUE, HAVING 
21:01:15 THEM SEPARATELY DISCUSS THE ITEM SO IT WOULD BE

21:01:18 EASIER TO FULFILL THE BROWN ACT.

21:01:22 IT IS IMPORTANT TO BE MINDFUL AS WE MAKE A DECISION ABOUT HOW THEY WILL 
21:01:25 PARTICIPATE IN THIS IMPORTANT DISCUSSION.

21:01:26 >> Councilmember Kassan:   OKAY.

21:01:31 AND SO IF HE WE DID -- BECAUSE I DO FEEL THERE WERE SOME  CONVINCING 
21:01:35 POINTS MADE THAT IT MIGHT MAKE SENSE TO JUST HAVE THIS DISCUSSION AND STRAW 
21:01:37 POLL HAPPEN AT ONE MEETING INSTEAD OF TWO.

21:01:45 SO IF WE DID GO WITH THAT OPTION 4, AND THERE WAS THAT POSSIBILITY, THAT WE 
21:01:50 WOULD END UP HAVING TO -- THE MEETING OF THE SENIOR COMMISSION, EVEN THOUGH 
21:01:52 IT WAS REALLY A MEETING OF THE MOBILITY

21:01:56 COMMISSION, THAT WOULDN'T REALLY ADD A LOT OF EXTRA WORK.

21:01:56 RIGHT?

21:02:01 IT WOULD BE JUST TWO NOTICES INSTEAD OF ONE, ISN'T THAT TRUE?

21:02:07 >> I WILL DEFER THE OPERATIONAL QUESTION TO THE CITY MANAGER'S OFFICE 
21:02:11 BECAUSE THEY ARE BETTER SUITED TO TELL US THE IMPACTS IT WROTE HAVE ON THEIR 
21:02:12 DEPARTMENTS.

21:02:14 BUT THE AGENDA ITSELF WOULD LOOK VERY SIMILAR.

21:02:23 >> AND WOULD I SAY THAT IT WOULD BE CLEAN TORE HAVE EACH BODY CONSIDER THE 
21:02:25 TRANSPORTATION ITEM SEPARATELY.

21:02:26 WITHIN THEIR OWN MEETINGS.

21:02:31 I THINK THAT WOULD BE -- WELL A COUPLE OF THINGS.

21:02:35 I THINK IT WOULD LEND TO MORE OF A FREE FLOW OF CONVERSATION FOR SENIOR 
21:02:39 COMMISSION, MORE FREE FLOW OF CONVERSATION FOR MOBILITY COMMISSION, 
21:02:43 AND THEN, OPERATIONALLY IT WOULD BE  CLEANER, IF WE

21:02:49 KNEW THESE ITEMS WERE BEING AGENDIZED AND WE WERE ABLE TO JUST VERY CLEAN 
21:02:54 LY AND CLEARLY NOTICE EACH MEETING.

21:02:56 >> Councilmember Kassan:   OKAY, THAT IS SUPER-HELPFUL.

21:03:02 I WILL GO BACK TO ADVOCATE FOR ITEM 3, KEEPING THE TWO MEETINGS SEPARATE AND 
21:03:05 PROVIDING OPPORTUNITIES FOR BOTH COMMISSIONS TO PROVIDE COMMENTS AND DO 
21:03:06 A STRAW POLL.

21:03:12 AND OF COURSE, IT'S -- AS WE DISCUSSED LAST TIME AS THIS CAME UP, WE ARE NOT 
21:03:16 TALKING ABOUT ANY KIND OF BINDING VOTE, IT'S JUST A STRAW POLL TO KIND OF 
21:03:19 GAUGE THE TEMPERATURE OF THE GROUP AND OF COURSE

21:03:21 CAPTURE THEIR COMMENTS SO THANK YOU SO MUCH.

21:03:27 >> Mayor Mei:   NEXT IS COUNCILMEMBER JONES.

21:03:30 >> Councilmember Jones:   THANK YOU, MADAM MAYOR.

21:03:34 ACTUALLY CITY MANAGER SHACKELFORD ANSWERED THE QUESTION, REGARDING 
21:03:40 PROVIDING THE AGENDA OR PROVIDING THE MINUTES TO OUR AGENDA.

21:03:44 DO YOU AGREE THAT THAT WOULD PROBABLY BE THE CLEANEST WAY TO DO IT, THAT IF 
21:03:48 WE HAD THE MINUTES FROM THE MEETING INCLUDED IN THE AGENDA WE ALL HAVE 
21:03:51 ACCESS TO THAT AND THEN A REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE

21:03:56 MOBILITY COMMISSION COULD SPEAK?

21:04:03 

21:04:07 >> Karena Shackelford:   I DO, ABSOLUTELY I AGREE.

21:04:09 >> Mayor Mei:   COUNCILMEMBER COX TO CLARIFY.

21:04:11 >> Councilmember Cox:   THANK YOU.

21:04:15 I APPRECIATE THE ADVISEMENT FROM OUR CITY MANAGER AND CITY ATTORNEY ON 
21:04:15 THAT.

21:04:19 I THINK PERSONALLY YOU KNOW AS I'M LISTENING YOU KNOW IT COULD BE VERY 
21:04:24 TAXING TO ASK ONE COMMISSIONER TO GO TO ANOTHER COMMISSIONER'S MEETING, BESEIU 
21:04:27 ALL THE LEGAL RESPONSIBILITIES AND THE LOGISTICS

21:04:34 AND THE THINGS THAT ARE -- IT'S MORE WORK THAN I THINK WE GET THE BENEFIT.

21:04:39 SO I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE INDEPENDENT THOUGHT PROCESS, THAT EACH COMMISSION 
21:04:43 WITHIN THEIR OWN COMMISSION THAT THEY'VE BEEN APPOINTED TO, TO BE ABLE 
21:04:47 TO PROVIDE THEIR INPUT AND THEN ROLLING IT UP AS THE

21:04:53 CITY MANAGER HAD MENTIONED INTO SOME SORT OF PUBLISHED MEETING MINUTES THAT 
21:04:55 WOULD GO WITH THAT ACTION.

21:05:00 SO IT WOULD JUST REQUIRE A LITTLE BIT OF PLANNING AND ACTION AND A BIT OF 
21:05:07 SOMETIME TO SPEAK ON THE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT THE GROUPS COULD GET INPUT 
21:05:09 TO ROLL INTO OUR CITY COUNCIL PACKET THAT WE COULD

21:05:10 READ BEFORE US.

21:05:12 SO I THINK OPTION 3 WOULD PROBABLY BE THE BEST.

21:05:20 AND I APPRECIATE COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND MAKING 
21:05:26 SURE THAT SOME OF THE MOST DIVERSE GROUPS HAVE INPUT INTO SOME OF THESE 
21:05:29 KEY DECISIONS THAT COULD IMPACT EVERYBODY'S DAILY

21:05:30 LIFE.

21:05:33 AND TRYING TO MAKE IT A BETTER PLACE HERE FOR FREMONT.

21:05:40 SO I APPRECIATE YOU BEING ABLE TO DO THAT, COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN AND INCLUDE 
21:05:41 THAT AS PART OF YOUR REFERRAL.

21:05:48 THANK YOU, AND THANK YOU TOO, ALL -- INCLUDING HANS AS WELL FOR HIS INPUT.

21:05:52 AND DRIVING THAT THROUGH, THAT HELPED US TO DRIVE SOME OF THESE OTHER THINGS 
21:05:57 TO BE ABLE TO BRING THEM FOR DISCUSSION SO THANK YOU EVERYONE.

21:05:59 >> Mayor Mei:   COUNCILMEMBER SHAO.

21:06:03 >> Councilmember Shao:   THANK YOU, MADAM MAYOR.

21:06:11 FIRST OF ALL, I REALLY SYMPATHIZE WITH ONE OF THE SPEAKERS REPRESENTING 
21:06:15 SENIORS ON THE CONFUSION OF THE NEW ROLES IN FREMONT.

21:06:26 AS A MATTER OF FACT, I HEAR SUCH A FEEDBACK ABOUT CONFUSION, NOT ONLY 
21:06:45  EXCLUSIVELY FROM OUR-GROUPS BUT TO HELP EDUCATE THE RESIDENTS, ESPECIALLY

21:06:53 WHEN THERE ARE BIKE LANES AND A NEW RIGHT TURN BULB-OUT, THAT TYPE OF ANY 
21:06:54 SETTINGS ON THE ROAD.

21:07:04 SO WITH THAT, I THINK THE PARTICIPATION OF THE SENIORS MAY OR MAY NOT HELP 
21:07:10 THEM WITH THE CONFUSION PER SE.

21:07:17 SO AS A MATTER OF FACT, ONCE AGAIN, TO REDUCE THE -- ANY POTENTIAL CONFUSION 
21:07:24 ABOUT THE FUTURE ROAD PROJECTS, THE EDUCATION SHOULD BE OPEN TO ALL OF OUR 
21:07:26 RESIDENTS.

21:07:35 AND RIGHT NOW, I ECHO COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN AND COUNCILMEMBER JONES 
21:07:46 ASSESSMENT THAT WE CAN DO A BETTER JOB BY INTRODUCING THE MEETING MINUTES OF 
21:07:53 THE MOBILE COMMISSION'S MEETING, PRIOR TO

21:07:57 THE CITY COUNCIL MEETING, AS A REFERENCE.

21:08:08 AND I ALSO APPRECIATE THE CITY ATTORNEY'S ADVISEMENT REGARDING THE 
21:08:18 BROWN ACT VIOLATION POTENTIALLY, AND THE CITY MANAGER'S CLARIFICATION.

21:08:25 SO I ECHO AND CONCUR WITH COUNCILMEMBER JONES AND COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN.

21:08:29 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

21:08:35 NEXT IS COUNCILMEMBER KENG.

21:08:37 >> Councilmember Keng:   THANK YOU MADAM MAYOR.

21:08:39 THANK YOU FOR THE STAFF'S RESPONSE TO THIS REFERRAL.

21:08:44 I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO HEAR THE FEEDBACK FROM BOTH THE MOBILITY 
21:08:47 COMMISSION AND SENIOR COMMISSION TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HEAR THESE 
21:08:54 REPRESENTATIVES FROM OUR COMMUNITY DIFFERENT INPUTS ON UPCOMING

21:08:55 MAJOR PROJECTS.

21:09:03 SO I AM LEANING TOWARDS OPTION NUMBER 3 TO HAVE ADVISORY ACTION ON BOTH 
21:09:07 COMMISSIONS AND HAVE THESE MEETING MINUTES TO  COUNCIL.

21:09:08 THANK YOU.

21:09:11 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

21:09:14 COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN.

21:09:16 >> Councilmember Salwan:   THANK YOU, MADAM MAYOR.

21:09:19 AND JUST WANT TO CLARIFY.

21:09:25 SO WHAT MYSELF AND COUNCILMEMBER JONES ARE PROPOSING IS SOMETHING WE ARE 
21:09:26 DOING WITHIN THE PLANNING COMMISSION.

21:09:29 IT'S NOT BEING CURRENTLY DONE WITH THE MOBILITY COMMISSION.

21:09:34 AND SO JUST TO CLARIFY, WE'RE SAYING THAT WE CAN USE THE SAME PROCESS THAT 
21:09:39 WE HAVE IN PLACE AS STAFF HAS DONE A GREAT JOB WITH BUT WE CAN DUPLICATE 
21:09:43 THAT AND DO ONE STEP ABOVE WHAT WE'RE DOING NOW.

21:09:49 AND SO WHAT I READ HERE I THINK EITHER OPTION 2 OR 3 IS SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN 
21:09:50 CAPTURES THAT.

21:09:55 I DON'T WANT TO CREATE A LOT OF WORK FOR THE STAFF BUT IF WE CAN HAVE 
21:09:59 MINUTES THAT CAPTURE THE COMMENTS, AND WE CAN MAKE IT PART OF THE PROCESS, I 
21:10:02 THINK THAT WOULD BE A VERY CLEAN WAY TO DO THAT.

21:10:06 ALSO, THE COMMENTS FROM THE CITY MANAGER REGARDING TWO SEPARATE 
21:10:10 MEETINGS, AGAIN I THINK THAT'S VERY CLEAN, WE GET THE FEEDBACK FROM THE 
21:10:14 SENIOR COMMISSION, WE GET FEEDBACK FROM HUMAN  RELATIONS

21:10:16 -- SORRY MOBILITY COMMISSION.

21:10:19 IN FACT WE SHOULD GET FEEDBACK FROM ALL THE COMMISSIONS SO I THINK THERE 
21:10:21 SHOULD BE SOME PROCESS IN PLACE.

21:10:24 BUT I DON'T WANT TO CREATE THIS EXPECTATION THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A 
21:10:29 LOT OF MEETINGS AND POLITICIZE THAT OR HAVE A LOT OF COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT SO 
21:10:32 THAT IT DOESN'T GIVE THE WRONG PERCEPTION TO THE

21:10:32 COMMUNITY.

21:10:37 BUT I DO FEEL THAT WE NEED TO GET THEIR VOICE ON THE TABLE, WE NEED TO SEE 
21:10:40 WHERE THEY STAND AND TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT.

21:10:48 THE OTHER THING, KIND OF A SIDE COMMENT BUT THE ULTIMATE TASK OF THE MOBILITY 
21:10:49 COMMISSION SHOULD GET BUY THIS FROM THE COMMUNITY.

21:10:53 I THINK THAT'S WHERE WE CAN DEFINITELY USE THEM A LOT BECAUSE THERE IS A LOT 
21:10:59 OF  MISUNDERSTANDINGS ABOUT THE CURRENT TECHNOLOGY THAT WE'RE USING, THE ROAD 
21:11:02 DIETS, THE  POLLS, ALL OF THAT.

21:11:07 SO IF WE CAN GET THEM FURTHER ENGAGED IN THE COMMUNITY TO SELL WHAT WE'RE 
21:11:09 PROPOSING, I THINK THAT WOULD GO A LONG WAYS.

21:11:11 THANK YOU.

21:11:13 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

21:11:17 COUNCILMEMBER JONES.

21:11:19 >> Councilmember Jones:   THANK YOU, MADAM MAYOR.

21:11:23 I AGREE WITH COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN BUT I THINK THAT YOU KNOW ESSENTIALLY IT'S 
21:11:28 DOING WHAT WE'RE DOING NOW BUT NOW WITH  A -- ADDING A COMPONENT OF -- ADDING 
21:11:30 THE MINUTES OF THE MOBILITY COMMISSION TO

21:11:31 THE COUNCIL.

21:11:37 AND I THINK THAT OPTION NUMBER 3 PROBABLY CAPTURES THAT THE BEST.

21:11:43 AND BEING THAT THIS IS COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN'S REFERRAL IF SHE WERE TO MAKE 
21:11:45 THAT MOTION I WOULD BE HAPPY TO SUPPORT IT.

21:11:46 >> Councilmember Kassan:   THANK YOU.

21:11:52 I'D LOVE TO MAKE THE MOTION THAT WE ADOPT OPTION NUMBER 3.

21:11:52 >> Councilmember Cox:   SECOND.

21:11:56 >> Mayor Mei:   PLEASE CAN WE HAVE A ROLL CALL.

21:12:01 I ALSO WANTED TO CLARIFY ONE THING IN TOTAL THAT WE SHOULD PROBABLY HAVE 
21:12:06 SOME DEFINITION OF WHAT SHOULD BE A MAJORITY PROJECT REPORT, WE DO HAVE 
21:12:10 THE CIP AND I DON'T WANT IT EVERYTHING ON THE CIP.

21:12:12 I'M SUPPORTIVE OF THE MOTION.

21:12:17 MOTION BY COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN AND SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER JONES.

21:12:24 ROLL CALL VOTE PLEASE.

21:12:26 >> The Clerk:   COUNCILMEMBER COX, AYE.

21:12:29 COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN, NAY.

21:12:32 COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, AYE.

21:12:35 COUNCILMEMBER JONES, AYE.

21:12:38 COUNCILMEMBER KENG, AYE.

21:12:40 VICE MAYOR SALWAN, AYE.

21:12:42 MAYOR MEI.

21:12:42 AYE.

21:12:46 >> Mayor Mei:   AND AGAIN, I JUST WANTED TO CAUTION BECAUSE ONE OF THE 
21:12:50 THINGS I WANTED TO LET PEOPLE KNOW IS WE'VE ALWAYS TALKED ABOUT 
21:12:53 RESPONSIVENESS SO HOPEFULLY WE CAN GET THE MAJORITY OF THE

21:13:01  COMMISSION HOPEFULLY WE'RE NOT WAITING FOR THAT TOO, WE WANT TO BE FLEXIBLE 
21:13:03 ENOUGH ORESPOND.

21:13:08 TO GET THEIR PARTICIPATION AND AS SUCH FOR THOSE WHO ARE INTERESTED I THINK 
21:13:13 WE'VE HAD SPEAKERS COMMENTS ABOUT DRIVING, THERE IS AN OPENING FOR THAT 
21:13:16 AS WELL AS THERE IS AN OPENING FOR MOBILITY

21:13:16 IMPAIRMENT.

21:13:20 SO WOULD LOVE TO GET PEOPLE TO JOIN THE COMMISSION FOR THAT AREA.

21:13:23 AND ALSO ONE OTHER NOTE SINCE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SENIORS.

21:13:28 I ALSO WANTED TO NOTE THAT THERE ARE SENIOR COMMISSION OPENINGS ON ALAMEDA 
21:13:31 COUNTY ITSELF FOR THE SENIOR COMMISSION.

21:13:32 SO.

21:13:39 AND WITH THAT, I ALSO WANTED TO TRANSFER BACK TO THE COUNCIL FOR ANY 
21:13:45 ORAL REPORT ON MEETINGS ON COMMISSIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE ATTENDED SUCH AS 
21:13:56 ACTC, EAST BAY COMMUNITY ENERGY OR THE WASTE REPUBLIC,

21:13:57 STOP WASTE OR OTHER AREAS.

21:14:04 SO I HAVE COUNCILMEMBER KENG TO REPORT OUT ON MEETINGS YOU ATTENDED.

21:14:08 >> Councilmember Keng:   THANK YOU, MR. MAYOR, I HAVE A QUICK REPORT OUT, 
21:14:12 DURING LAST WIEKS'S COUNCIL MEETING THERE WAS A NEIGHBORHOOD MEETING AT 
21:14:17 THE NORTH BAY PARK LAST SATURDAY WITH OUR POLICE CHIEF

21:14:21 AND DEPUTY CHIEF, THE MEETING WAS VERY WELL ATTENDED ALMOST 40 NEIGHBORS IN 
21:14:26 THE AREA AND THIS IS IN RESPONSE TO SOME OF THE RECENT COMMUNITY CONCERNS 
21:14:26 ON PUBLIC SAFETY.

21:14:32 AND SO FOR MOST OF THE NEIGHBORS IT WAS THEIR FIRST TIME FOR THEM TO MEET IN 
21:14:42 PERSON OF WITH CHIEF WASHINGTON AND DEPUTY CHIEF BREED AND WE DEVOTED THE 
21:14:51  MAJORITY OF THE MEETING TIME WITH ENGAGEMENT.

21:14:58 WE WILL CONTINUE WITH PUBLIC SAFETY AND ANY E-MAIL QUESTIONS YOU FEEL FREE TO

21:15:11 THAT THANKFULLY WE'VE HAD SOME SUPPORT FROM.

21:15:17 ONE IS THAT ON FRIDAY WE HAD THE SENIOR PEER COUNSELORS WHICH HAD THEIR 
21:15:21 GRADUATION AND I WANT TO THANK OUR FREMONT HUMAN SERVICES DEPARTMENT FOR 
21:15:21 THEIR SUPPORT.

21:15:30 VOLUNTEERS WHO ARE DEDICATING AND THEY'VE SPENT 25 HOURS IN TRAINING AND 
21:15:33 THE CONTINUATION OF A PROGRAM THAT WE THINK IS SO

21:15:37 WONDERFUL TO HAVE AS A NEEDED RESOURCE IN THESE TIMES.

21:15:42 BECAUSE WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THIS CONNECTIVITY NOR OUR COMMUNITY 
21:15:48 MEMBERS AND I APPRECIATE THOSE WHO STEP UP TO SHARE THEIR TALENTS WITH ALL OF 
21:15:50 OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS SO THANK YOU FOR

21:16:06 ALSO WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW THAT WE TOOK AN ACTION AS THE MAYORS TO TALK 
21:16:08 ABOUT PRESERVING THE RIGHT FOR WOMEN TO HAVE

21:16:10 ACCESS TO THEIR HEALTH DECISIONS.
