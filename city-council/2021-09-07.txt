19:11:32 DEPARTMENT MEMBERS FOR THEIR SERVICE.
SO THANK YOU ALL FOR THIS RECOGNITION, 
19:11:37 AND I WOULD SAY IF WE COULD TAKE A MOMENT OF SILENCE JUST FOR REMEMBERING 
19:12:01 THOSE WHO LOST THEIR LIVES.  THANK YOU.  MAY WE NEVER FORGET.  NEXT ON OUR 
19:12:04 AGENDA ITEM IS ORAL COMMUNICATIONS, AND THOSE ARE ANY ITEMS THAT ARE NOT 
19:12:08 SCHEDULED ON THIS AGENDA THIS EVENING.  AND IF PEOPLE WOULD LIKE TO RAISE 
19:12:14 THEIR HAND TO DO SO.  COMMUNICATIONS RECEIVED VIA EMAIL ARE ALSO PLACED ON 
19:12:17 FILE AND CONSIDERED PART OF THE PUBLIC RECORD.  SO MEMBERS WISHING TO SPEAK 
19:12:24 MAY DO SO ON THE RAISE HAND ICON OR AGAIN BY PRESSING STAR NINE, AND 
19:12:27 AGAIN, TONIGHT BECAUSE IT'S A VERY  PACKED AGENDA, WE'RE GOING TO LIMIT TO 
19:12:33 A MINUTE AND A HALF.  THANK YOU SO MUCH.  SO DO YOU WANT TO CALL THE 
19:12:49 FIRST SPEAKER?  KELLY ABREU, WELCOME.
>>  THANK YOU.  SO STARTING OVER THE 
19:12:52 LAST THREE DAYS, DOZENS OF PARKING TICKETS HAVE BEEN ISSUED AT MISSION 
19:12:58 PEAK.  THESE PARKING TICKETS DIDN'T COST $75, WHICH MOST PEOPLE MIGHT 
19:13:03 ASSUME THAT THAT'S WHAT A PARKING TICKET COSTS IN FREMONT.  NOWADAYS.  
19:13:08 BECAUSE THERE WAS A 19% INCREASE IN PARKING TICKET COSTS IN FREMONT.  BUT 
19:13:16 NO, NO.  THE CITY OF FREMONT WAS QUIETLY PROCEEDING TO HIKE THE FEE 
19:13:22 EVEN HIGHER.  THERE ACTUALLY IS A 30% INCREASE.  NOW THE PRICE OF PARKING 
19:13:28 TICKETS AT MISSION PEAK, THOSE PERMIT THINGS, $82.  AND WHY THE DIFFERENCE?  
19:13:36 WELL, NO EXPLANATION GIVEN.  BUT THERE WAS ONE CITY COUNCILMEMBER FROM 
19:13:42 DISTRICT 6 WHO ASKED QUESTIONS, HOW ARE WE GOING TO COMMUNICATE THIS TO THE 
19:13:47 PUBLIC?  AND  RECEIVED ASSURANCES, SINCERE ASSURANCES FROM STAFF THAT WE 
19:13:52 WOULD POST THIS ON THE CITY WEBSITE AND QUARTERLY  NEWSLETTER.  OF COURSE 
19:13:59 THESE FINES, THIS FEE HIKE HAPPENED IN A MATTER OF, YOU KNOW, SIX OR SEVEN OR 
19:14:06 EIGHT WEEKS, A QUARTERLY NEWSLETTER IS 13 WEEKS, BY THE WAY, SO THE TIMELINE 
19:14:09 IS DIFFERENT AND IT WAS NOT EVEN IN THE HEADLINE.

19:14:12 THE HEADLINE IS A CITY NOISE ORDINANCE.  IT WAS BURIED IN THE LAST TWO 
19:14:17 SENTENCES OF THE ANNOUNCEMENTS.  THIS IS AN EMBARRASSMENT.  THIS CITY 
19:14:24 COUNCIL NEEDS TO MAKE $75 TICKETS THE STANDARD.  THANK  YOU.

19:14:33 >> Mayor Mei: NEXT SPEAKER IS  SURESH.  WELCOME.  I'M SORRY, YOU'RE STILL ON 
19:14:45 MUTE, SURESH.  OKAY.  SURESH, WE'LL PASS RIGHT NOW BECAUSE WE'LL WAIT 
19:14:49 UNTIL YOU UNMUTE.  I WILL FIRST GO TO WILLIAM.

19:14:54 >>  YES, GOOD EVENING.  THIS IS WILLIAM YRAGUI, MISSION PEAK CONSERVANCY, 
19:14:59 AGAIN SPEAKING OUT ON THE ISSUE OF PARKING FEES IN THE MISSION HILLS 
19:15:03 NEIGHBORHOOD, SPECIFICALLY THE INCREASE IN FEES FROM WHAT HAS BEEN $62 FOR THE 
19:15:10 LAST FOUR YEARS TO $82 OVER THIS WEEKEND, AND FORTHCOMING FROM WHAT WE 
19:15:14 CAN READ.  SO THE ISSUE IS REALLY SIMPLE.  YOU'RE BILLING PEOPLE, AND 
19:15:20 THESE ARE VISITORS TO OUR PUBLIC PARKS, AND YOU'RE NAILING THEM $82.  THIS IS 
19:15:24 AN EXCESSIVE FEE GIVEN THAT MOST OF THE PEOPLE THAT USE OUR PUBLIC PARKS ARE 
19:15:31 YOUNG, AND THEY HAVE LIMITED RESOURCES.  SO BILLING PEOPLE $82 FOR PARKING IN 
19:15:37 FRONT OF SOMEBODY'S HOUSE ON A PUBLIC STREET IS UNTENABLE.  AND THE 
19:15:41 JUSTIFICATION IS GIVEN THAT WE'RE TRUEING UP OUR COSTS COMPARED TO OTHER 
19:15:45 CITIES, BUT OTHER CITIES DON'T -- OTHER THAN SAN FRANCISCO, AND SAN FRANCISCO 
19:15:56 HAS AN $85 FEE, BUT SAN MATEO IS $42, SAN JOSÉ IS LESS.  I MEAN, IF YOU READ 
19:16:00 THE EMAIL I FORWARDED TO THE COUNCIL AND THE BOARD OF EAST BAY REGIONAL, 
19:16:03 YOU'LL SEE IN FACT THAT THESE FEES ARE QUITE HIGH.  SO WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE 
19:16:10 THAT THE FEES ARE DECREASED AND LENIENCY GIVEN TO THOSE THAT WERE 
19:16:15 GIVEN TICKETS FOR THE LABOR DAY WEEKEND.  THANK YOU.

19:16:19 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.  THE NEXT SPEAKER IS SURESH.

19:16:25 >>  HI.  OKAY.  FINALLY FIGURED OUT HOW TO UNMUTE.  THANK YOU.  ACTUALLY THE 
19:16:37 PREVIOUS TWO SPEAKERS HAVE ALREADY SPOKEN ON THIS TOPIC OF A VERY -- WAY 
19:16:41 OF INCREASING THE PARKING FEE.  I DID NOT SEE ANY SIGN OR ANY  WARNING, AND 
19:16:47 IN FACT, IF ANYTHING, IF THE CITY STAFF SAY THEY WANT THE FEES TO BE 
19:16:53 COMPARABLE TO NEARBY CITIES, THEY SHOULD BE LOWERING THE FEE FROM $62 AS 
19:16:59 OPPOSED TO INCREASING TO $82.  OR AT LEAST JUST MAINTAIN IT AT $62.  I DO 
19:17:04 NOT SEE ANY JUSTIFICATION ON HOW THE CITY STAFF CAN CLAIM THAT RAISING THE 
19:17:10 FEE FROM $62 TO $82 IS -- ALLOWS THEM TO BRING TO WHAT THE OTHER 
19:17:15 COMMUNITIES, WHETHER IT BE MILIPITAS, WHETHER IT'S SAN JOSÉ, WHETHER IT'S 
19:17:23 SAN MATEO DOING IT.  THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.  NEXT SPEAKER 
19:17:41 IS GOKUL.  WELCOME.
>>  SORRY, I WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK ON 
19:17:45 ITEM 5, NOT ON THIS TOPIC.  SORRY ABOUT THAT.

19:17:51 >> Mayor Mei: OKAY, THANK YOU.
>> THANK YOU.  THAT WAS THE LAST OF 
19:17:54 OUR PUBLIC COMMENTS.  NOW WE'RE GOING TO RETURN TO THE ITEMS THAT WERE 
19:18:04 PULLED FROM THE CONSENT CALENDAR.  BEGINNING WITH ITEM 2D AS IN DOG.  
19:18:10   SPEAKER FOR ITEM 2D --
>> Ms. Gauthier: CHRIS AND KELLY WITH 
19:18:15 THE SPEAKERS FOR 2D.  IF THEY CAN RAISE THEIR HANDS AGAIN SO WE CAN UNMUTE 
19:18:21 THEM.
>>  THIS ITEM INVOLVES A CONTRACT WITH 
19:18:29 A LOCAL COMMUNITY COLLEGE TO DO VIDEO SERVICES.  THE PROBLEM IS, MAYBE IT'S 
19:18:33 NOT A PROBLEM, JUST A REMARK I'D LIKE TO MAKE, THAT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE 
19:18:40 THAT THE CITY HAS  SELECTED IS LOCATED IN HAYWARD AND LIVERMORE.  AND WE HAVE 
19:18:48 OUR OWN COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT HERE.  THEY HAD A CHANGE OF 
19:18:50 LEADERSHIP.  THE CITY COUNCILMEMBERS ARE OFTEN POINTING TO OTHER 
19:18:53 ORGANIZATIONS TALKING ABOUT THE CHANGE OF LEADERSHIP THAT RECENTLY HAPPENED.  
19:18:58 WELL, THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT HAD A CHANGE, THE NEW LEADER IS A 
19:19:04 PRESIDENT BY THE NAME OF DR. BISHOP, AND THIS IS -- THE NEW LEADERSHIP IS 
19:19:09 TREMENDOUS.  YOU SHOULD TAKE A LOOK.  THEIR NEW LEADERSHIP IS AN EXAMPLE FOR 
19:19:15 HOW ORGANIZATIONS OUGHT TO BE RUN.  AND WHEN WE TALK ABOUT -- SO GIVEN THAT WE 
19:19:20 HAVE THIS LEADERSHIP, WE HAVE OUR OWN COMMUNITY COLLEGE, IT'S CALLED OHLONE 
19:19:25 COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT.  IN NEWARK AND  FREMONT.  AND THEY HAVE A LOT OF 
19:19:34 THINGS THAT THEY DO, A LOT OF FIELDS OF STUDY AND A LOT EXPERTISE OVER THERE.  
19:19:38 ONE MEMBER OF THE CITY COUNCIL HAS SOME KNOWLEDGE OF THAT ORGANIZATION, SOME 
19:19:44 DEEP KNOWLEDGE, IN DISTRICT 6, COUNCILMEMBER COX, AND I THINK THAT 
19:19:49 THE CITY SHOULD THINK ABOUT WORKING MORE WITH OUR LOCAL COMMUNITY COLLEGE 
19:19:52 DISTRICT.  OHLONE COMMUNITY COLLEGE.  THANK YOU.

19:20:00 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.  NEXT SPEAKER IS CHRIS.

19:20:04 >>  ACTUALLY IT WAS FOR D, F AND K.
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY, THANK YOU.  ARE 
19:20:09 THERE ANY OTHER COMMENTS FROM THE COUNCIL?  SEEING NONE, IF THERE ARE 
19:20:16 NONE, THEN IF I CAN GET A MOTION.  OR IF THERE'S ANY COMMENTS FROM STAFF, 
19:20:25 BUT OTHERWISE.  COULD I GET A MOTION FOR THIS ITEM?  MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER 
19:20:28 JONES.
>> Vice Mayor Shao: I'D LIKE TO 
19:20:28 SECOND.
>> Mayor Mei: SECONDED BY 
19:20:36 COUNCILMEMBER SHAO.  ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE.

19:20:41 >> Ms. Gauthier: COUNCILMEMBER COX, AYE.  COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN, AYE.  
19:20:45 COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, AYE.  COUNCILMEMBER JONES, AYE.  
19:20:53 COUNCILMEMBER KENG, AYE.  VICE MAYOR SHAO, AYE.  MAYOR MEI,  AYE.  THE ITEM 
19:20:59 2D PASSES UNANIMOUSLY.  NEXT IS ITEM 2E AS IN EDWARD.  AND CHRIS, I BELIEVE 
19:21:02 YOU WERE THE SPEAKER FOR THIS.  WELCOME.

19:21:09 >>  YES.  THANK YOU.  I JUST WANTED TO CALL OUT THAT THE SECOND TIME WE'RE 
19:21:15 SORT OF RENEWING THIS LEASE, AND IT APPEARS THAT THE ONLY REASON WE'RE 
19:21:23 ADDING THE EXTRA 62.5K IS BECAUSE OF LEAD TIME CHANGES.  AND I THINK BY 
19:21:29 NOW, WE'VE  LEARNED FROM COVID THAT LEAD TIME CHANGES HAD CHANGED FOR 
19:21:32 EVERYTHING, AND YOU CAN'T DO IT LIKE YOU USED TO AND I THINK THIS SHOULD 
19:21:40 SERVE AS A WARNING TO THE CITY THAT IF YOU GUYS  USED TO ALLOW 7 WEEKS, YOU 
19:21:43 NOW NEED TO ALLOW 14 IN ALL YOUR PLANNING, AND THAT'S ALL I WANTED TO 
19:21:46 SAY.  BECAUSE I KNOW YOU'VE ALREADY SPENT THE MONEY TO BUILD THE BUILDING, 
19:21:52 AND I THINK WE'RE JUST SPENDING A LITTLE BIT EXTRA TO ACCOMPANY -- THAT 
19:21:56 MAKES $52 MILLION A YEAR AND EMPLOYS ONE PERSON.  THANK YOU.

19:22:07 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.  ARE THERE ANY COMMENTS OR CAN I GET A MOTION ON THIS 
19:22:10 ITEM, ITEM 2E?
>> Councilmember Jones: I'LL MOVE TO 
19:22:11 APPROVE.
>> Mayor Mei: MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER 
19:22:23 JONES, SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN.  ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE.

19:22:25 >> Ms. Gauthier: COUNCILMEMBER COX, AYE.  COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN, AYE.  
19:22:30 COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, AYE.  COUNCILMEMBER JONES, AYE.  
19:22:39 COUNCILMEMBER KENG, AYE.  VICE MAYOR SHAO, AYE.  MAYOR MEI,  AYE.  THE ITEM 
19:22:51 2E PASSES UNANIMOUSLY.  NEXT IS ITEM 2F, THE APPROPRIATION OF THE 20/21 
19:22:54 MEASURE BB PARATRANSIT FUNDS.  CHRIS, DID YOU WANT TO SPEAK ON THIS, I 
19:22:56 THINK.
>> YES, I BELIEVE SO.  LET ME SCROLL 
19:23:07 TO MAKE SURE.  SO IN  HERE, IT SHOWED THAT THESE FUNDS WERE GOING TO -- 
19:23:13 WELL, MAKE SURE I GOT THE RIGHT ONE BEFORE I SPEAK.  I'M GOING TO SPEAK 
19:23:17 AND IF I GOT THE WRONG ONE, PLEASE CORRECT ME, NOW THAT I LOOK AT IT.  I 
19:23:23 MEANT TO PICK UP THE ONE FOR THE FUNDING OF THE NAVIGATION CENTER, AND 
19:23:28 MY ONLY CALLOUT WAS THAT IT'S BEEN A YEAR, THE ONE-YEAR REPORT SHOULD BE 
19:23:36 OUT BEFORE WE RE-FUND IT.  I KNOW THERE'S A SIX MONTH REPORT OUT.  I 
19:23:41 LOOKED AT IT, BUT IT ONLY SAYS WE HELPED 44 PEOPLE AND THAT WAS THE 
19:23:45 LATEST I COULD SEE, BUT NOW WE'RE RENEWING THE FUNDING, AND I THINK THE 
19:23:49 ONE YEAR REPORT SHOULD HAVE BEEN READY BEFORE THE CITY COUNCIL RENEWED THE 
19:23:52 FUNDING.  THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU FOR THE 
19:23:56 COMMENTS.  WE HAVE ACTUALLY APPROVED THAT ITEM ALREADY.  ITEM 2I.  BUT 
19:24:02 COULD WE GET A MOTION TO APPROVE ITEM 2F, WHICH IS THE PARATRANSIT FUND 
19:24:06 ALLOCATION FOR MEASURE BB?
>> Councilmember Jones: SO  MOVED.

19:24:09 >> Mayor Mei: MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER JONES.  SECONDED BY VICE MAYOR SHAO, I 
19:24:11 THINK?  I'M NOT SURE.
>> Vice Mayor Shao: YES.

19:24:15 >> Mayor Mei: I THINK SO.  ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE.

19:24:19 >> Ms. Gauthier: YES, MADAME MAYOR.  COUNCILMEMBER COX, AYE.  COUNCILMEMBER 
19:24:28 SALWAN, AYE.  COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, AYE.  COUNCILMEMBER JONES, AYE.  
19:24:35 COUNCILMEMBER KENG, AYE.  VICE MAYOR SHAO, AYE.  MAYOR MEI,  AYE.

19:24:42 >> Mayor Mei: THE MOTION PASSES UNANIMOUSLY FOR ITEM 2F AS IN FRANK.  
19:24:48 AND I WILL NOT BE ABLE TO COMMIT YET, BUT I'M SURE THAT -- I KNOW FROM THE 
19:24:52 HOMELESS NAVIGATION CENTER, THERE WILL BE A FORTHCOMING REPORT.  I THINK IT 
19:25:01 WAS OPENED AT THE END OF SEPTEMBER.  NEXT IS ITEM 2K, AS IN KICK.  WHICH I 
19:25:05 THINK IS THE SALARY ADOPTION -- SALARY SCHEDULE.

19:25:09 >>  I APOLOGIZE FOR GETTING THE WRONG LETTER.  ONE NOTE CHANGED IT FROM I TO 
19:25:14 F, BECAUSE I  ASSUMED IT HAD TO COME AFTER D, I CHANGED IT BACK SEVERAL 
19:25:24 TIMES BUT IT KEPT CHANGING.  BUT FOR  K, I JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT THE 
19:25:29 PUBLIC RECORD EXACTLY MIRRORS WHAT'S ALREADY ON THE WEBSITE SO YOU CAN'T 
19:25:31 SEE IF THERE WERE ANY CHANGES IN SALARY, AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN GREAT 
19:25:37 IF SOMEONE WOULD HAVE DONE AN ANALYSIS FOR THE PUBLIC THAT BASICALLY SAID WE 
19:25:41 REALLY DIDN'T DO ANY SALARY CHANGES EXCEPT WE ADDED THESE TITLES FOR FULL 
19:25:45 TIME, THERE WAS FOUR OF THEM AND PART-TIME, THERE WAS THREE, AND JUST 
19:25:49 SUM IT UP SO THAT THE CITIZENS CAN QUICKLY LOOK AT THAT.  IT WOULD BE 
19:25:56 MORE TRANSPARENT THAT WAY.  THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY.  THANK YOU.  DO WE 
19:26:04 HAVE A MOTION TO MOVE THE ITEM 2K AS IN KICK?

19:26:07 >> Councilmember Jones: SO  MOVED.
>> Mayor Mei: MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER 
19:26:12 JONES, SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER COX.  ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE.

19:26:18 >> Ms. Gauthier: COUNCILMEMBER COX, AYE.  COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN, AYE.

>> Mr. Larsen: I HAVE A BRIEF OVERVIEW 
19:27:18 PRESENTATION FOR THIS ITEM.  I'M GOING TO SHARE MY SCREEN HERE.  HOPEFULLY 
19:27:21 THAT'S VISIBLE.  SO THE PURPOSE OF THIS COUNCIL ITEM IS TO FACILITATE THE 
19:27:28 NILES GATEWAY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT, WHICH WAS A NEW 75-UNIT HOUSING 
19:27:32 PROJECT THAT WAS  APPROVED BY THE CITY COUNCIL ABOUT SIX MONTHS AGO, ON  
19:27:38 MARCH 9TH, 2021.  A CONDITION OF APPROVAL FOR THE PROJECT IS TO CONVERT 
19:27:44 A PORTION OF NILES BOULEVARD FROM A PUBLIC STREET TO A PRIVATE STREET.  
19:27:47 THIS IS THE STREET SEGMENT SHOWN IN BLUE ON THE DEVELOPMENT MAP THAT'S 
19:27:54 SHOWN ON THE SCREEN, AND THE SEGMENT OF STREET IS ALSO ILLUSTRATED IN THE 
19:28:02 PHOTO TO THE BOTTOM LEFT.  SO IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STATE REGULATIONS, 
19:28:09 VACATING A PUBLIC STREET REQUIRES A HEARING PROCESS.  ALSO THE CITY'S 
19:28:12 CONDITIONS OF DEVELOPMENT APPROVAL REQUIRE THAT THE CITY RECEIVE FAIR 
19:28:19 MARKET VALUE FOR THE STREET PROPERTY BASED ON AN INDEPENDENT APPRAISAL.  AN 
19:28:27 APPRAISAL WAS CONDUCTED BY SMITH AND ASSOCIATES, AN APPRAISAL FIRM THAT WAS 
19:28:33 IDENTIFIED BY THE CITY FROM A POOL OF THE APPRAISERS THAT WE USE THAT ARE 
19:28:39  INDEPENDENT, EXPERIENCED AND REPUTABLE.  AND THEN THE ACTUAL 
19:28:43 APPRAISAL WAS FUNDED BY LENNAR HOMES, THE DEVELOPER OF THE PROJECT.

19:28:48 IN THE APPRAISAL THAT WAS DONE, THEY LOOKED AT THE 50 BY 600-FOOT STREET 
19:28:53 PARCEL, WHICH IS ABOUT THREE QUARTERS OF AN ACRE.

19:28:57 AS PART OF THEIR APPRAISAL ASSESSMENT, THEY IDENTIFIED -- OR WE IDENTIFIED 
19:29:04 THROUGH THE PROCESS THAT THERE WAS A NEED TO RETAIN PUBLIC EASEMENTS FOR 
19:29:07 UTILITIES AND PUBLIC ACCESS.
SO WE HAVE THE SEWER LINE IN THE 
19:29:13 STREET, A WATER LINE, AN AT&T FIBER COMMUNICATION LINE.

19:29:18 ALL OF THEM ARE IMPORTANT TO MAINTAIN.
AND THEN THE STREET ALSO SERVES ACCESS 
19:29:22 TO ALAMEDA CREEK FOR ITS OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE, AND THERE'S A REQUIREMENT 
19:29:30 THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT THAT ACCESS BE FACILITATED FOR A CONNECTION TO THE 
19:29:33 ALAMEDA CREEK TRAIL FOR BOTH RECREATION AND TRANSPORTATION PURPOSES.

19:29:41 IN THE APPRAISAL PROCESS, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT PRIMARILY DUE TO ALL 
19:29:45 THE EASEMENTS AND REQUIREMENTS ACROSS THE LAND THAT THERE ISN'T ANY SEPARATE 
19:29:50 ECONOMIC VALUE THAT THE LAND HAS FOR ANY OTHER TYPE OF DEVELOPMENT, SO 
19:29:56 ESSENTIALLY THE BEST VALUE OF THE LAND IS TO SERVE ESSENTIALLY AS A STREET, 
19:29:59 BUT HERE WE'RE CONVERTING IT FROM A PUBLIC STREET TO A PRIVATE STREET.

19:30:04 SO THE APPRAISED VALUE OF LAND WAS ASSESSED BY THE APPRAISER AT $10,000.

19:30:14 WE CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND, SOME FOLKS THAT MAY HAVE SEEN THIS, GETTING THREE 
19:30:18 QUARTERS OF AN ACRE OF LAND IN FREMONT FOR $10,000 SOUNDS LIKE A DEAL, BUT 
19:30:27 WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT, IT SOUNDS OFF FOR SOME REASON, DUE TO VALUES IN FREMONT 
19:30:30 BEING MUCH HIGHER, WHICH WE CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THAT CONCERN, BUT WHEN YOU 
19:30:35 DIG DEEPER INTO ALL THE DIFFERENT EASEMENTS AND LIMITATIONS ON THE LAND, 
19:30:42 THAT'S WHAT DRIVES THE VALUE DOWN.
SO WHAT WE HAVE ESSENTIALLY IS THE 
19:30:45 RECOMMENDED ACTION IS TO CONDUCT A PUBLIC HEARING BASICALLY ON THE 
19:30:50 CONSIDERATION OF VACATING THIS PORTION OF NILES BOULEVARD WITH THE CONDITION 
19:30:56 THAT EASEMENTS BE MAINTAINED FOR UTILITIES AND FOR ACCESS TO ALAMEDA 
19:31:00 CREEK, AND THEN THE OTHER ACTION IS TO AUTHORIZE THE SALE OF THE VACATED 
19:31:06 STREET IN THE AMOUNT OF $10,000.
WE HAVE STAFF HERE AVAILABLE ON THE 
19:31:11 CITY SIDE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS, AS WELL AS REPRESENTATIVES FROM LENNAR 
19:31:13 AND THE PROPERTY APPRAISER FROM SMITH AND ASSOCIATES.

19:31:18 THAT CONCLUDES MY BRIEF PRESENTATION.
HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS THE 
19:31:20 COUNCIL HAS.
THANK YOU.

19:31:36 >> Ms. Gauthier: MAYOR MEI, YOUR MICROPHONE?

19:31:40 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
I WAS GOING TO SAY, CLARIFYING 
19:31:42 QUESTIONS, WE'LL BEGIN WITH VICE MAYOR SHAO.

19:31:44 >> Vice Mayor Shao: THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR.

19:31:53 I HAVE A PROCEDURAL QUESTION FOR YOU.
WHY WOULD THIS ITEM BE SEPARATED FROM 
19:31:59 THE APPROVAL OF THE PROJECT AND VOTED ON LATER, SEPARATELY?

19:32:03 THAT'S MY QUESTION.
THE SECOND QUESTION IS THAT IF, LET'S 
19:32:12 SAY, THIS ITEM FAILED TO PASS, WHAT IMPACT WOULD IT HAVE TO THE ALREADY 
19:32:19 APPROVED PROJECT?
>> Mr. Larsen: SO I CAN TAKE A SHOT AT 
19:32:25 THAT AND PROBABLY ENCOURAGE OUR CITY ATTORNEY'S OFFICE TO MAYBE ADDRESS THE 
19:32:30 QUESTION ABOUT IF THIS ITEM DOESN'T PASS, WHAT'S THE IMPLICATION OF THAT.

19:32:33 SO I THINK FROM A PROCEDURAL PERSPECTIVE, THERE'S TWO KIND OF 
19:32:39 SEPARATE ACTIONS RELATED TO THE DEVELOPMENT APPROVAL.

19:32:43 THE DEVELOPMENT APPROVAL HAS, AS A CONDITION OF THE APPROVAL, THE 
19:32:46 VACATION OF THE STREET AND CONVERSION OF IT FROM A PUBLIC STREET TO A 
19:32:50 PRIVATE STREET.
THAT UNDER THE STREETS AND HIGHWAYS 
19:32:55 CODE AND GOVERNMENT CODE IS A SEPARATE DISCRETIONARY PROCESS, AND SO THAT'S 
19:32:59 WHY WE'RE BRINGING THIS FORWARD, IT'S REALLY A SEPARATE ACTION THAT WE NEED 
19:33:02 TO TAKE THAT SUPPORTS THE IMPLEMENTATION.

19:33:08 I'LL DEFER TO DEBRA OR OTHERS ON HER TEAM ON THE QUESTION IF THIS DOESN'T 
19:33:15 PASS, WHAT'S THE IMPLICATION OF THAT.
MS. MARGOLIS SO THE DEVELOPER IN THIS 
19:33:19 CASE HAS APPROVED A VESTING TENTATIVE MAP WHICH GRANTS THEM THE RIGHT TO 
19:33:21 BUILD THIS PROJECT SUBJECT TO THE CONDITIONS OF APPROVAL THAT ARE 
19:33:28 INCLUDED IN THAT APPROVAL.
ONE OF WHICH IS THAT THEY PURCHASE 
19:33:32 THIS VACATED STREET SEGMENT.
IT CAN'T BE DONE AT THE TIME OF THE 
19:33:36 TENTATIVE MAP APPROVAL BECAUSE IF FOR SOME REASON THE PROJECT WAS NEVER 
19:33:38 CONSTRUCTED, THIS VACATION WOULD NEVER  HAPPEN.

19:33:44 BUT IT DOES NEED TO BE DONE BEFORE THEY CAN GET THEIR FINAL MAP ON THE 
19:33:46 PROJECT.
IF THE COUNCIL WERE TO DECIDE NOT TO 
19:33:50 APPROVE THIS TONIGHT, IT IS A DISCRETIONARY ACTION, HOWEVER, YOUR 
19:33:54 DISCRETION IS LIMITED.
IT IS, AS I SAID, A VESTED TENTATIVE 
19:33:59 MAP WHICH MEANS THE DEVELOPER HAS RIGHTS TO DEVELOP THE PROPERTY 
19:34:04 PURSUANT TO THE APPROVED MAP, WHICH INCLUDES THIS PRIVATE STREET AND 
19:34:08 ACCESS EASEMENT.
SO I THINK IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO 
19:34:15 DENY THIS WITHOUT HAVING SOME KIND OF RAMIFICATIONS FROM THE DEVELOPER FOR 
19:34:18 INTERFERING WITH THEIR ABILITY TO CONSTRUCT THE PROJECT AS APPROVED IN 
19:34:23 THE MAP.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:34:26 DO YOU HAVE ANOTHER -- THAT'S YOUR ONLY CLARIFYING QUESTION, CORRECT?

19:34:29 THANK YOU.
COUNCILMEMBER KENG, CLARIFYING 
19:34:33 QUESTION?
>> Councilmember Keng: YES, THANK YOU, 
19:34:37 MAYOR.
SO FOR HANS, SO IN OTHER WORDS, YOUR 
19:34:45 CLARIFICATION EARLIER WAS TO SAY THAT THIS -- IF WE VOTE TO APPROVE TO SELL 
19:34:53 THIS PIECE  OF -- STRIP OF LAND, THE BUILDER CANNOT USE TO PUT ANY HOUSING, 
19:34:58 IT'S TOO NARROW, IT'S MORE OF A LIABILITY FOR THEM TO MAINTAIN AND 
19:35:02 GAIN ACCESS TO THE  UTILITIES, IS THAT CORRECT?

19:35:05 >> Mr. Larsen: YEAH, THAT'S CORRECT, AND THE FIRST SLIDE I SHOWED, SHOWED 
19:35:11 THE LOCATION OF THE PROPERTY WHERE THE STREET  IS, AND SO THE PLAN WITH THE 
19:35:16 PRIVATE DEVELOPMENT IS TO USE IT AS PART OF -- AS PART OF THE ACCESS AND 
19:35:20 STREET SYSTEM FOR THE PRIVATE DEVELOPMENT, SO IT REALLY DOESN'T -- 
19:35:27 IT ISN'T USED FOR ANY ADDITIONAL HOUSING UNITS THAT THEY GET, IT REALLY 
19:35:33 JUST CONTINUES TO SERVE AS ACCESS AND CONVEY THE EXISTING UTILITIES AND 
19:35:39 ACCESS RIGHTS THAT ARE THERE NOW.
SO YEAH, THERE ISN'T ANY KIND OF ADDED 
19:35:42 VALUE.
I MIGHT JUST ADD, FROM THE CITY'S 
19:35:45 PERSPECTIVE, STAFF, WE THINK THIS IS A GREAT DEAL FOR US.

19:35:52 I MEAN, ESSENTIALLY THIS IS A STREET THAT IS OVERDUE FOR MAINTENANCE AND WE 
19:35:55 HAVEN'T MAINTAINED IT BECAUSE IT HAD BEEN ENVISIONED TO BE PART OF A FUTURE 
19:36:01 DEVELOPMENT PROJECT.
BUT LONG TERM MAINTENANCE AND SWEEPING 
19:36:07 AND DEALING WITH PARKING MANAGEMENT AND SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT I THINK 
19:36:09 COUNCIL IS AWARE OF THAT HAVE OCCURRED ON THE STREET SEGMENT, SO WE THINK 
19:36:14 THIS IS A GOOD DEAL FOR THE PUBLIC TO RELEASE THIS AS PART OF OUR PUBLIC 
19:36:19 INVENTORY AND INTEGRATE IT INTO THE PRIVATE DEVELOPMENT, AND ALL THE 
19:36:25 PUBLIC INTEREST IN THE LAND ARE STILL RETAINED THROUGH THE EASEMENTS THAT 
19:36:29 WOULD CARRY WITH IT.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:36:33 >> Councilmember Keng: THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: CLARIFYING QUESTION, 
19:36:35 COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN.
>> Councilmember Kassan: YES, THANK 
19:36:37 YOU.
I JUST WANTED TO MENTION THAT THERE 
19:36:50 WAS AN ITEM ON THE  JULY 20TH CONSENT CALENDAR THAT WAS AN APPROVAL OF -- IT 
19:36:52 WAS INITIATION OF A PROCEEDING TO VACATE A PORTION OF NILES BOULEVARD, 
19:36:57 SO I JUST WANTED TO DOUBLE-CHECK, WAS THAT THE FIRST PART OF THE PROCESS 
19:37:02 THAT WE'RE NOW COMPLETING TONIGHT?
>> Mr. Larsen: YES, SO THE PUBLIC 
19:37:08 HEARING PROCESS KIND OF FIRST REQUIRES AN OFFICIAL NOTICE OF AN INTENT OR 
19:37:12 INTEREST TO VACATE THE STREET, SO THAT WAS THE ACTION IN JULY.

19:37:18  THAT COUNCIL APPROVED, AND THEN WE NOTIFIED -- POSTED NOTICES OF THE 
19:37:28 HEARING AND THE PROPOSED DATE OF CONSIDERING THE ACTION, SO THE STREET 
19:37:34 VACATION PROCESS REQUIRES THE COUNCIL TO TAKE AN INITIAL ACTION OF INTENTION 
19:37:41 TO CONSIDER THAT ACTION.
>> Councilmember Kassan: THANK YOU.

19:37:43 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
CLARIFYING QUESTION, COUNCILMEMBER 
19:37:47 JONES.
>> Councilmember Jones: THANK YOU.

19:37:52 JUST VERY QUICKLY, HANS, THIS RIGHT-OF-WAY PROVIDED TO THE DEVELOPER 
19:37:55 IS GOING TO PROVIDE ACCESS FOR NOT ONLY RESIDENTS BUT FOR EMERGENCY VEHICLES 
19:38:00 AS WELL, IS THAT CORRECT?
>> Mr. Larsen: YEAH, AND CERTAINLY ANY 
19:38:06 EMERGENCY ACCESS THAT'S NEEDED TO -- WITHIN THE DEVELOPMENT COULD USE THOSE 
19:38:09 STREETS.
ALSO IF THERE WAS A NEED FOR ANY 
19:38:16 EMERGENCY ACCESS FOR ANY KIND OF ISSUE OR INCIDENT IN ALAMEDA CREEK OR ON THE 
19:38:21 TRAIL, THAT'S PART OF THE PUBLIC ACCESS THAT WOULD BE CARRIED THROUGH THERE AS 
19:38:24 WELL, SO YES, ANY NEEDS FOR EMERGENCY ACCESS ARE COVERED.

19:38:30 >> Councilmember Jones: THANK YOU.
AND THEN AS AN EASEMENT FOR ALL OF 
19:38:35 THESE UTILITIES, THERE IS ACTUALLY NO WAY TO BUILD ANY TYPE OF PERMANENT 
19:38:36 STRUCTURE ON TOP OF THAT, IS THAT CORRECT?

19:38:39 >> THAT'S CORRECT.
>> Councilmember Jones: ALL RIGHT.

19:38:45 THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: CLARIFYING QUESTION, 
19:38:46 COUNCILMEMBER COX.
>> Councilmember Cox: THANK YOU.

19:38:51 I WOULD LIKE TO FIND OUT, IS THIS AREA IN A FLOOD ZONE WITH THE CREEK RIGHT 
19:38:58 THERE?
WITH THAT ROAD BEING VACATED?

19:39:00 >> Mr. Larsen: I DON'T HAVE SPECIFIC DATA.

19:39:08 I MEAN, THE ALAMEDA CREEK CHANNEL WAS DESIGNED TO BE A FLOOD CONTROL 
19:39:13 CHANNEL, SO I'M NOT AWARE OF THIS AREA OF BEING WITHIN -- IN A FLOOD ZONE.

19:39:18 I GUESS JUST THE ONLY QUALIFIER TO THAT IS WE'RE DEALING WITH TIMES OF CLIMATE 
19:39:23 CHANGE AND, YOU KNOW, THESE THINGS ARE SEA LEVEL RISE AND ALL THAT, SOME OF 
19:39:26 THESE THINGS ARE CHANGING FROM WHAT THEY HAVE BEEN HISTORICALLY, BUT I'M 
19:39:33 NOT AWARE THAT THERE'S ANY KIND OF FLOODING ISSUE.

19:39:37 CERTAINLY THAT WOULD HAVE COME OUT AS PART OF THE OVERALL DEVELOPMENT REVIEW 
19:39:40 PROCESS, SO AGAIN, I'M PRETTY CONFIDENT THAT THERE'S NO ISSUE THERE, SO I 
19:39:45 THINK WE'D BE MORE CONCERNED WITH ANY FLOODING ISSUE WITH PROPOSED NEW 
19:39:48 DEVELOPMENT THAN WE WOULD BE WITH VACATED STREET AREA.

19:39:54 >> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.
JUST TO CLARIFY ONE MORE TIME, SO WITH 
19:40:00 THIS PIECE OF LAND, ONLY THE PEOPLE THAT LIVE IN THAT DEVELOPMENT WILL 
19:40:10 HAVE ACCESS TO THE LAND OR WILL OTHERS THAT ARE OUTSIDE OF THAT DEVELOPMENT 
19:40:16 CAN GO IN AND USE THAT LAND TO WALK THROUGH THE TRAILS?

19:40:19 >> Mr. Larsen: YEAH, SO THE INTENT, AND THIS WAS ACTUALLY CLARIFIED IN THE 
19:40:24 CONDITIONS OF APPROVAL FOR THE DEVELOPMENT, THAT THIS CORRIDOR, 
19:40:31 PEOPLE HAVE THE RIGHT TO USE THIS CORRIDOR TO ACCESS THE ALAMEDA CREEK 
19:40:35 TRAIL.
SO THE ROAD AND THE SIDEWALK THAT'S 
19:40:41 WITHIN THE DEVELOPMENT ARE PART OF A PUBLIC ACCESS EASEMENT FROM KIND OF 
19:40:45 GREATER NILES INTO THE AREA, AND THEN CERTAINLY ANY OF THE UTILITY COMPANIES 
19:40:52 OR OTHER AGENCIES THAT NEED THE ACCESS EITHER FOR THEIR UTILITY LINES OR FOR 
19:40:57 ACCESS TO THE ALAMEDA CREEK CHANNEL HAVE THE RIGHTS TO USE THIS CORRIDOR 
19:41:01 FOR OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE PURPOSES.

19:41:03 >> Councilmember Cox: THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE CLARIFICATION.

19:41:07 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
NEXT CLARIFYING QUESTIONS, 
19:41:08 COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN.
>> Councilmember Salwan: THANK YOU, 
19:41:11 MADAME MAYOR, AND THANK YOU, MR. LARSEN.

19:41:15 JUST A QUESTION, AS FAR AS PHYSICALLY WHAT'S THERE, WILL IT CHANGE 
19:41:19 MATERIALLY?
WILL IT STILL BE THE SAME KIND OF 
19:41:24 DRIVEWAY OR WHAT WILL HAPPEN AS PART OF THIS ADDITION TO THE PROJECT?

19:41:29 >> Mr. Larsen: SO THE DEVELOPER ACTUALLY IS MAKING QUITE A SUBSTANTIAL 
19:41:35 INVESTMENT IN THE STREET.
BASICALLY RECONSTRUCTING IT.

19:41:40 JUST FOR THE PAVEMENT AREA.
BUT THEN THERE'S A NEW SIDEWALK, 
19:41:45 THERE'S LANDSCAPING THAT GOES IN THE CORRIDOR, SO IT WILL BE UPGRADED BOTH 
19:41:52 IN TERMS OF ITS FUNCTIONALITY AND BE AN ATTRACTIVE NEW UPGRADED PARK OF THE 
19:41:56 ADJOINING DEVELOPMENT.
>> Councilmember Salwan: OKAY, THANK 
19:41:58 YOU.
I THINK YOU KIND OF MENTIONED, THERE'S 
19:42:02 A PERCEPTION THAT WE'RE SELLING THIS PARCEL FOR $10,000.

19:42:06 AND I THINK WHAT I'M HEARING FROM YOU, AND PLEASE CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG, IS 
19:42:13 THAT THIS IS A BURDENED PARCEL WHICH HAS LOTS OF EASEMENTS SO WE CAN'T DO 
19:42:18 ANYTHING THERE.
WE ALREADY HAVE TO MAINTAIN IT, AND WE 
19:42:23 HAVE NOT PUT THE FUNDING TO BRING THIS UP TO A NORMAL STATE OF REPAIR SO THAT 
19:42:27 WOULD REQUIRE MONEY FROM OUR POCKETS, AND WE'RE NOT GIVING UP ANYTHING, THEY 
19:42:31 STILL HAVE TO MAINTAIN IT, AND GOING FORWARD, THE BEST PART, WE DON'T HAVE 
19:42:36 TO HAVE ONGOING FEES IN  MAINTENANCE.
AND THAT WILL PROBABLY BE PICKED UP BY 
19:42:39 THE HOA OR WHO WOULD TAKE CARE OF THOSE?

19:42:42 >> YES, THAT WOULD BE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE HOA IN THE 
19:42:44 FUTURE.
>> Councilmember Salwan: AND I THINK 
19:42:48 YOU ALLUDED TO THIS EARLIER, BUT WE HAD SOME OTHER BLIGHT AND OTHER ISSUES.

19:42:53 COULD YOU SPECIFY WHAT SORT OF THINGS WE WERE NOTICING IN THAT STREET?

19:43:00 >> WELL, SO THIS KIND OF STUBBED END OF AN OLD PART OF NILES BOULEVARD HAS 
19:43:05 BEEN AN AREA WHERE THERE'S BEEN CONCERNS WITH ILLEGAL PARKING, ILLEGAL 
19:43:14  DUMPING, WE'VE HAD A HISTORY OF HOMELESS RVs AND CAMPER VEHICLES THAT 
19:43:17 HAVE PARKED HERE, SO IT'S BEEN SOMETHING THAT FROM AN OPERATIONS AND 
19:43:24 MAINTENANCE PERSPECTIVE, THAT'S TAKEN CITY RESOURCES TO HELP MANAGE THAT.

19:43:29 SO ONE OF THE BENEFITS OF THE PROJECT IS BASICALLY THIS GETS INCORPORATED 
19:43:37 AND MANAGED AS PART OF THE PRIVATE STREET SYSTEM AND NEW DEVELOPMENT, SO 
19:43:40 THAT WON'T BE SOMETHING WE'LL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR IN THE FUTURE.

19:43:44 >> Councilmember Salwan: AND HOPEFULLY THE HOMEOWNERS OR THE HOA WILL HAVE 
19:43:48 PRIDE AND WILL WANT TO MAINTAIN THE UPKEEP AND HAVE THAT VESTED INTEREST 
19:43:51 TO UPLIFT THE AREA.
THANKS FOR ALL THE CLARIFICATIONS.

19:43:55 THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU FOR THE 
19:43:59 CLARIFYING QUESTIONS.
AT THIS TIME, I'LL TURN TO THE 
19:44:02 SPEAKERS.
I BELIEVE RIGHT NOW WE HAVE FIVE 
19:44:04 SPEAKERS.
AGAIN, IF WE KEEP THE MINUTE AND A 
19:44:05 HALF.
FIRST SPEAKER IS CHRIS.

19:44:09 WELCOME, CHRIS.
>> THANK YOU.

19:44:15 I ACTUALLY WENT OUT TO THIS PARCEL TODAY, AND I CAN'T SEE HOW THE CITY IS 
19:44:20 CONSIDERING SELLING THIS FOR $10,000.
EVEN THOUGH IT HAS ALL THE EASEMENTS, 
19:44:27 THIS WOULD REALLY FIT YOUR PARKING OF RVs, AT LEAST FOR A TEMPORARY TIME 
19:44:30 PERIOD, AND I KEEP HEARING FROM THE CITY COUNCIL, THEY WANT TO MEET THEM 
19:44:35 WHERE THEY'RE AT.
YOU COULD PARK SEVERAL RVs BY BLOCKING 
19:44:39 OFF THE END OF THE STREET.
THERE'S ROOM, IT DOESN'T MATTER IF 
19:44:42 THEY'RE MOVABLE FOR THE EASEMENT.
WHAT YOU SHOULD LOOK AT IS, WHAT WOULD 
19:44:45 IT COST THE CITY TO BUY A THIRD OF AN ACRE OF LAND TO DO THE SAME THING?

19:44:50 ADDITIONALLY, TECHNICALLY, I DON'T BELIEVE YOU GUYS MET THE CALIFORNIA 
19:44:58 STREETS AND HIGHWAY CODES 8323.
I WENT OUT THERE AND LOOKED FOR THE -- 
19:45:03 SIGNS AND I DID NOT FIND THREE OF THEM, AND IT TOOK ME 10 MINUTES TO ACTUALLY 
19:45:06 FIND THE SIGNS.
SO YOU HAVEN'T ACTUALLY MET THE 
19:45:09 CALIFORNIA CODE.
I'M HAPPY TO PROVIDE PICTURES IF YOU'D 
19:45:11 LIKE.
THANK YOU.

19:45:20 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
NEXT SPEAKER IS GOKUL BALA.

19:45:23 WELCOME.
>> MADAME MAYOR, RESPECTED 
19:45:32 COUNCILMEMBERS, AGAIN, THE -- $10,000, IT SOUNDS TOO LOW FOR THIS PRECIOUS 
19:45:36 REAL ESTATE.
AND EVEN IF THEY'RE GIVING IT FOR 
19:45:41 FREE, I DON'T SEE TANGIBLE BENEFITS FOR THE RESIDENTS OF FREMONT.

19:45:45 OF COURSE, THE MEMBERS IN THAT GATED COMMUNITY WOULD BENEFIT, WHICH IS 
19:45:54 PRETTY OBVIOUS, BUT OTHER THAN THAT -- THIS IS PRESHT REAL ESTATE, SO IF THE 
19:46:01 BUILDER WANTS TO DEVELOP A PUBLIC PARK AND OPEN -- HAVE AN ENTRY, NO ACCESS, 
19:46:08 OPEN ACCESS TO RESIDENTS, THEN YOU CAN CONSIDER GIVING IT FREE BECAUSE 
19:46:11 THEY'RE INVESTING NO MONEY.
BUT OTHERWISE FINDING AN EXCUSE THAT 
19:46:15 WE CANNOT MAINTAIN 600 FEET OF ROAD, SERIOUSLY?

19:46:19 CITY OF FREMONT HAS BEEN MAINTAINING MILES AND MILES, HUNDREDS OF MILES OF 
19:46:23 ROADS.
AND FINDING FUNDS TO MAINTAIN 600 FEET 
19:46:29 WOULD NOT BE A CHALLENGE.
I DO AGREE THAT -- UNNECESSARY PARKING 
19:46:34 OF RVs, THAT IS A VALID CONCERN, BUT STILL, THERE SHOULD BE A BETTER WAY OF 
19:46:38 UTILIZING THE SPACE.
IF EITHER WE LOOK AT THE VALUE OF THE 
19:46:44 LAND OR IF WE ARE SUBSIDIZING IT, THEN IT SHOULD BE OPENED TO THE PUBLIC, 
19:46:49 SHOULD BENEFIT THE RESIDENTS OF FREMONT RATHER THAN -- THIS COMMUNITY.

19:46:52 THANK YOU, MADAM, THANK YOU, COUNCIL MEMBERS.

19:46:53 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
NEXT SPEAKER IS KELLY.

19:47:01 >> WELCOME, KELLY.
>> THANK YOU.

19:47:05 FIRST OFF, THERE'S A FALSE CHOICE BEING PRESENTED HERE.

19:47:08 OH, MY GOD, IF THE DEVELOPER DOESN'T GET THIS LAND, THEN BAD THINGS WOULD 
19:47:10 HAPPEN.
WELL, THE CHOICE IS NOT ABOUT WHETHER 
19:47:13 OR NOT THIS DEVELOPER GETS THE LAND.
THE DEVELOPER IS GOING TO GET THE 
19:47:16 LAND.
THE QUESTION IS, AT WHAT PRICE.

19:47:21 WELL, HOW MUCH IS AN ACRE OF -- THREE QUARTERS OF AN ACRE OF LAND IN NILES 
19:47:23 WORTH?
WELL, IT MIGHT BE WORTH, I DON'T KNOW, 
19:47:26 A MILLION DOLLARS?
AND YOU'RE GIVING THIS AWAY FOR 10,000 
19:47:28 AND YOU'RE PRETENDING LIKE IT'S SOMEHOW DEVALUED.

19:47:35 WELL, EVERYBODY ELSE HAS GOT DEVALUED LANDS EVERYWHERE AND THEY'RE PAYING A 
19:47:37 MILLION DOLLARS AN ACRE FOR DEVALUED LANDS.

19:47:41 AND WHAT ABOUT THE PUBLIC USE?
THIS PUBLIC BENEFIT, THIS PEDESTRIAN 
19:47:43 ACCESS EASEMENT TO THE ALAMEDA CREEK TRAIL?

19:47:47 THIS THING HAS BEEN DEVALUED ITSELF.
IT'S ONLY 4 FEET WIDE.

19:47:51 YOU KNOW, THE CITY PUBLIC WORKS DEPARTMENT BUILDS STREETS EVERYWHERE, 
19:47:54 THEIR STREET STANDARD FOR A SIDEWALK IS 5 FEET WIDE.

19:48:00 HOW IS IT THAT IF THAT'S OUR BENEFIT, OUR EASEMENT, IF YOU DRILL DOWN, IF 
19:48:04 YOU ACTUALLY LOOK AT THE ENGINEERING DRAWINGS FOR THESE SIDEWALKS, THEY'RE 
19:48:05 LAUGHABLE.
THEY'RE 4 FEET WIDE.

19:48:11 WE NEED WIDER SIDEWALKS, YOU KNOW, IF WE'RE GOING TO HAVE -- THAT'S OUR 
19:48:14 BENEFIT, IS A PEDESTRIAN EASEMENT, THEN GIVE US A NICE PEDESTRIAN EASEMENT.

19:48:17 ALSO THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC FUNDS DOCTRINE.

19:48:21 IN THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION, ARTICLE 16, SECTION 6, PROHIBITS THE GIVING OR 
19:48:24 LENDING OF PUBLIC FUNDS TO ANY PERSON OR ENTITY, PUBLIC OR PRIVATE.

19:48:30 THIS ENCOMPASSES THE GIVING OF MONETARY FUNDS AND ANY THING OF VALUE, MAKING 
19:48:34 THE GIFT OF ANY PUBLIC MONEY OR THING OF VALUE TO ANY INDIVIDUAL, MUNICIPAL 
19:48:38 OR OTHER CORPORATION WHATEVER --
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:48:46 NEXT SPEAKER IS LIZ AMES OF  BART.
>> GOOD EVENING, MAYOR MEI AND 
19:48:50 COUNCILMEMBERS.
THIS IS LIZ AMES, YOUR BART DIRECTOR.

19:48:58 SO I AM HOPING THAT THE COUNCIL WOULD RECONSIDER THIS DESIGN.

19:49:03 I'M ACTUALLY WANTING TO SPEAK ON THE TRAILS PLAN LATER IN THE EVENING, BUT 
19:49:09 LOOKING AT THE TRAILS PLAN, IT SAYS ROADWAY ENVIRONMENTS CAN FACILITATE 
19:49:14 TRAIL DEVELOPMENT.
THESE FACILITIES COULD INCLUDE A 
19:49:23 CORRIDOR THAT WOULD RELY ON SEPARATE BIKE LANE CLASS FOUR BIKEWAYS TO MAKE 
19:49:25 A CONNECTION.
I GUESS WE HAVE THESE CONCEPTS CALLED 
19:49:29 SIDE PATHS THAT THE CITY WILL BE CONSIDERING TONIGHT.

19:49:34 AND THEY'RE MULTIUSE PATHS LOCATED IMMEDIATELY ADJACENT TO THE ROADWAY.

19:49:39 THEY ARE SIMILAR TO SIDEWALKS EXCEPT THEY EXPLICITLY ALLOW TWO-WAY BIKE 
19:49:42 TRAVEL.
SO I DON'T WANT TO GO ON AND ON ABOUT 
19:49:46 THIS, BUT I DO HOPE THAT SINCE NILES CANYON TRAIL IS A PRIORITY IN THE 
19:49:52 SHORT TERM, WE CAN'T LOSE SIGHT OF THESE VALUABLE CONNECTIONS THAT LINK 
19:49:56 TO DOWNTOWN.
DOWNTOWN NILES IS ESSENTIAL AND OF 
19:50:01 COURSE THAT'S AN ECONOMIC DRIVER FOR FREMONT, BUT SO ARE THESE CONNECTIONS, 
19:50:07 SO THERE IS ECONOMIC VALUE FOR THESE TRAILS ONCE THEY'RE LOST, IT HARD TO 
19:50:11 RECOUP AND REENVISION THE AREA.
SO I HOPE THAT WE CAN RECONSIDER THIS 
19:50:15 SITE WITH A MORE ROBUST BIKE TRAIL CONNECTION TO THE CANYON AND TO THE 
19:50:16 DOWNTOWN.
THANK YOU.

19:50:21 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
AND THE LAST -- THERE'S THREE MORE 
19:50:24 SPEAKERS.
SURESH.

19:50:31 >> HI.
SO ONCE THIS PROPERTY HAS BEEN 
19:50:35 TRANSFERRED TO HOA, THE NEXT THING THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN AFTER A COUPLE 
19:50:39 YEARS AFTER ALL THE HOUSING HAS BEEN BUILT AND PEOPLE HAVE MOVED IN, 
19:50:43 THEY'RE GOING TO START COMPLAINING ABOUT NON-RESIDENTS WALKING ON THE 
19:50:47 STREET TO GO TO THE ALAMEDA CREEK.
AND WE'LL HAVE A REPEAT OF WHAT IS 
19:50:53 HAPPENING NOW OR HAS HAPPENED TO US OVER THE YEARS IN THE MISSION PEAK, 
19:50:56 AND THE CITY WILL FIND A WAY OR THE DEVELOPER WILL PUT SOME LOCKS THERE SO 
19:51:00 THAT NO ONE CAN ACCESS THE ALAMEDA  CREEK.

19:51:04 I WOULD LIKE MR. LARSEN TO ANSWER THAT.

19:51:09 HOW DO I KNOW THAT THIS IS NOT GOING TO BE HAPPENING A FEW YEARS DOWN THE 
19:51:09 ROAD?
THANK YOU.

19:51:20 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
NEXT SPEAKER IS RAM CHITTUR.

19:51:22 >> YEAH.
CAN YOU HEAR ME?

19:51:25 THANK YOU, EVERYONE.
THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME THE 
19:51:28 OPPORTUNITY.
I ALSO HAVE THE SAME OBJECTION LIKE 
19:51:34 EVERYONE HAS.
I HAVE ANOTHER SUGGESTION TO MAKE, 
19:51:38 THAT IF NILES IS GIVING AWAY THIS LAND FOR THIS AMOUNT, THEN WE NEED TO GET 
19:51:43 SOMETHING -- YOU KNOW, IF THERE IS NO OTHER OPTION BUT TO GIVE IT, THEN I 
19:51:46 WOULD RATHER SAY THAT THERE SHOULD BE SOMETHING BESIDES THE LAND VALUE, IT 
19:51:49 SHOULD ALSO LOOK AT OTHER VALUE THAT IT CAN PROVIDE IN NILES BOULEVARD.

19:51:55 NILES BOULEVARD ITSELF ON THE OTHER END OF NILES BOULEVARD, THERE ARE ISSUES 
19:51:58 THAT HAS BEEN THE SAME CASE THAT IS HAPPENING ON THE OTHER SIDE, WHICH 
19:52:08 MEANS THERE ARE TONS OF VEHICLES BEING STORED THERE, DEBRIS LANDING ON THE 
19:52:12 OTHER SIDE OF NILES.
SO BESIDES THE FEAR OF BEING A GATED 
19:52:17 COMMUNITY AND LOSING ACCESS TO IT, LIKE THE BUDDHA TEMPLE ON THE OTHER SIDE 
19:52:20 HAS ACTUALLY TAKEN AWAY THE LAND AND THEY HAVE A GATED COMMUNITY THERE.

19:52:27 NOW FOR US TO WALK INTO THE ISHERWOOD PARK, IT ONE DAY WE'LL NEED ACCESS TO 
19:52:29 GO TO THERE.
SO I THINK WITH ALL THESE FEARS IN 
19:52:34 MIND, YOU THINK WE SHOULD RECONSIDER THE PLAN OF GIVING TO THE BUILDER AT 
19:52:37 WHATEVER COST IT WOULD BE, BUT WE SHOULD MAKE SURE THAT ALL THESE THINGS 
19:52:38 ARE CONSIDERED.
THANK YOU.

19:52:42 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
NEXT SPEAKER IS JOHN HINDS.

19:52:47 >> HELLO, EVERYONE.
I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT THIS HAPPENS 
19:52:52 TO BE A STRETCH OF ROAD THAT I WALK SEVERAL TIMES A WEEK AND HAVE FOR THE 
19:52:58 LAST FEW YEARS, AND IN THE CONDITION THAT IT'S IN NOW, IT IS A PRETTY GOOD 
19:53:03 PLACE IF YOU WANT TO EXECUTE A QUICK DRUG DEAL OR MAYBE LINE UP SOME 
19:53:07 PROFESSIONAL LOVE.
IT'S NOT IN GOOD SHAPE, AND YOU COULD 
19:53:11 ARGUE THAT MAYBE THAT'S BECAUSE IT'S BEEN NEGLECTED BY THE CITY FOR YEARS 
19:53:15 AND FALLEN INTO A POOR CONDITION, BUT IT ALSO MEANS THAT IF THE CITY WANTED 
19:53:18 TO FIX IT UP, IT WOULD COST SOME MONEY.

19:53:23 ITS VALUE IS LIMITED BY THE FACT THAT IT'S 40 OR 50 FEET AWAY FROM A 
19:53:29 RAILROAD TRACK, WHICH IS ELEVATED AND MAKES A BIT OF A CURVE THERE THAT'S 
19:53:30 APPROACHING A BRIDGE OVER ALAMEDA CREEK.

19:53:36 SO WHEN TRAINS GO BY, THERE'S THE SQUEAKING OF WHEELS AGAINST THE RAIL 
19:53:40 THERE, IT'S NOT A SUPER DESIRABLE SPOT, AND I WAS A LITTLE STARTLED BY THE LOW 
19:53:45 PRICE OF $10,000 AT FIRST, BUT THE MORE I THINK ABOUT IT, I DON'T THINK IT'S 
19:53:51 WORTH A WHOLE LOT MORE THAN THAT TO THE CITY, BECAUSE WE'D HAVE TO SPEND SO 
19:53:53 MUCH TO MAKE IT ANY BETTER.
THANK YOU.

19:53:56 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
ROBERT DAULTON.

19:54:03 >> GOOD EVENING.
I WOULD LIKE TO JOIN SOME OF THE OTHER 
19:54:08  SPEAKERS IN SUGGESTING THAT THE CITY TRY AND GET A LITTLE BIT MORE FOR 
19:54:17 THEIR MONEY OUT OF THIS LAND SALE.
I AGREE WITH DIRECTOR AMES THAT A MORE 
19:54:21 ROBUST BICYCLE AND PEDESTRIAN ACCESS TO THE TRAIL WOULD BE A GREAT THING TO 
19:54:25 HAVE BECAUSE AS WE KNOW, PEOPLE HAVE BEEN PARKING THEIR CARS AT THE END OF 
19:54:30 THE STREET, GETTING THEIR BICYCLES OUT OF THEIR CARS AND PROCEEDING TO THE 
19:54:34 TRAIL FOR THE LAST, I DON'T KNOW, 20 YEARS AS LONG AS I'VE BEEN WALKING 
19:54:41 THAT TRAIL MYSELF.
THE BUILDER IN THE MAP, THE  VESTED 
19:54:51 MAP, APPEARS TO BE PUTTING GRASS AND CURB AND SIDEWALK WELL INTO THE 
19:54:54 STREET, PROBABLY AT LEAST 40% OF THE WAY INTO THE STREET.

19:54:58 SO THE BUILDER CERTAINLY DOESN'T FEEL THAT THIS PIECE OF PROPERTY IS WORTH 
19:55:03 ONLY $10,000 BECAUSE ALL OF THE TOWNHOUSES THAT ARE FRONTING THAT 
19:55:09 PRIVATE STREET WILL INCLUDE NEARLY 40% OF THE STREET ITSELF AS PART OF THE 
19:55:17 PURCHASE PRICE.
SO I ASKED AGAIN IF THE CITY LOOKED 
19:55:21 CLOSE AT THE DEAL AND JUST TRY AND GET A BETTER DEAL HERE.

19:55:23 10,000 BUCKS, IT SEEMS LIKE AN INSULT.
THANK YOU.

19:55:28 >> Mayor Mei: AND AT THIS TIME, I'M GOING TO CLOSE THE PUBLIC COMMENT 
19:55:32 PERIOD AND I'D LIKE TO BRING IT BACK TO THE COUNCIL FOR CONVERSATION AND 
19:55:36 DISCUSSION.
WE'LL BEGIN WITH COUNCILMEMBER 
19:55:37 SALWAN.
>> Councilmember Salwan: THANK YOU, 
19:55:40 MADAME MAYOR.
THE FIRST QUESTION I HAD WAS, IN 
19:55:45 RESPONSE TO SOME OF THE FOLKS SPEAKING, WAS RELATED TO ACCESS.

19:55:48 HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT WE MAINTAIN ACCESS FOR THE FOLKS THAT WANT TO USE 
19:55:54 ALAMEDA CREEK AND THAT IT DOESN'T BECOME AN EXCLUSIVE BENEFIT FOR ONE 
19:55:58 COMMUNITY BUT IT'S OPEN TO ALL, HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT?

19:56:08 >> Mr. Larsen: I THINK -- I  MEAN, BASED ON KIND OF THE CONDITIONS OF 
19:56:15 DEVELOPMENT, THERE'S BASICALLY A LEGAL CONDITION THAT ACCESS IS ALLOWED 
19:56:23 THERE, AND DEBRA HAS SOME ADDITIONAL PERSPECTIVES ON IT, BUT CAN WE GUERIN 
19:56:30  GUARANTEE THAT IN PERPETUITY?
MY GUESS IS THIS IS THE WAY THIS HAS 
19:56:33 BEEN DESCRIBED.
WHETHER THIS COMES BACK IN THE FUTURE 
19:56:38 AND SOMEBODY WANTS TO REVISIT IT, I CAN'T REALLY PREDICT WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN 
19:56:42 IN THE FUTURE, BUT BASED ON THE ACTIONS THAT THE COUNCIL HAS TAKEN AND THE 
19:56:47 LEGAL REQUIREMENTS, THE PUBLIC HAS ACCESS BACK TO ALAMEDA CREEK AND THE 
19:56:49 TRAIL BASED ON HOW EVERYTHING HAS BEEN SET UP.

19:56:57 >> Councilmember Salwan: CAN THE CITY ATTORNEY WEIGH IN ON THAT?

19:57:00 >> Ms. Margolis: I DON'T HAVE MUCH TO ADD TO THAT.

19:57:05 I AGREE WITH WHAT HANS HAS JUST SAID.
IT'S A CONDITION OF APPROVAL SO WILL 
19:57:09 BE REQUIRED OF THE PROJECT, AND IF THEY FAIL TO COMPLY WITH THAT IN THE 
19:57:13 FUTURE, WE'D HAVE THE RIGHT TO TRY AND ENFORCE THAT, AND YOU KNOW, TAKE IT 
19:57:16 FROM THERE.
>> Councilmember Salwan: THE OTHER 
19:57:19 ISSUE THAT KEEPS COMING UP IS THE APPRAISED VALUE.

19:57:28 SO I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD COMMENT ON THAT, AS FAR AS WHAT MAKES THE FAIR 
19:57:34 AS FAR AS THE EXPERTISE OF THE APPRAISERS, YOU KNOW, HOW DO WE 
19:57:39 SATISFY THE PEOPLE THIS IS FAIR MARKET VALUE BASED ON ALL THE ENCUMBRANCES 
19:57:43 THAT ARE ON THE PARCEL?
>> Mr. Larsen: SO I THINK KIND OF THE 
19:57:49 QUICK ANSWER IS -- I  MEAN, THE APPRAISER THAT WE  USED, THE POOL OF 
19:57:53 APPRAISERS THE CITY USES, SO THE FIRM SMITH AND ASSOCIATES ARE A COMPANY 
19:58:00 THAT WE USE THAT WORK IN OUR INTEREST AND OTHER PUBLIC AGENCIES, AND THEIR 
19:58:05 REPUTATION IS BASED ON BEING INDEPENDENT AND CREDIBLE, AND I THINK 
19:58:11 FROM OUR  PERSPECTIVE, WE TRUST THE ANALYSIS THAT THEY DID FOR THIS.

19:58:20 I THINK FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE, WE THINK WE'RE GETTING A PRETTY GOOD DEAL.

19:58:24 I SPOKE WITH THE APPRAISER, SO ESSENTIALLY THE LOGIC IN TERMS OF HOW 
19:58:31 THERE IS SOME VALUE TO THIS, GIVEN THE COMMITMENT THAT THE DEVELOPER HAS TO 
19:58:39  PUT IN TO IMPROVE IT, THERE REALLY IS NO OTHER USE FOR THE LAND OTHER THAN 
19:58:43 TO CONVEY UTILITIES AND PROVIDE ACCESS.

19:58:48 THE BENEFIT THAT ONE COULD COME UP WITH FOR THE DEVELOPMENT IS ESSENTIALLY -- 
19:58:55 YOU KNOW, THEY HAVE SOME MORE CONTROL OVER THE PRIVATE STREET, SO IT GETS 
19:58:58 INTEGRATED INTO THEIR  DEVELOPMENT, AND ONE COULD ARGUE THAT THERE'S SOME 
19:59:03 POSITIVE ELEMENTS THAT CLEARLY FROM A FINANCIAL PERSPECTIVE, THERE'S A LOT 
19:59:06 OF FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITIES THAT COME WITH THAT.

19:59:17 AND SO IN THE OPINION OF THE APPRAISER, MUCH OF THIS IS BASED ON JUDGMENT AND 
19:59:21 EXPERIENCE, THERE'S SOME NOMINAL VALUE THAT THAT CONTROL HAS.

19:59:29 SO IT WAS ESTIMATED AT $10,000.
I KNOW COUNCIL HAS A BIG AGENDA 
19:59:31 TONIGHT.
WE DO HAVE THE APPRAISER HERE IN 
19:59:37 ATTENDANCE, IF COUNCIL WOULD WANT TO DELVE INTO THIS FURTHER, BUT I JUST 
19:59:44 KIND OF SHARED THE CONVERSATION WITH YOU THAT I HAD WITH HIM.

19:59:51 >> CLIFF NOTE, HIGH LEVEL, WHY THIS PARCEL MIGHT BE FRUITFUL, TO HEAR FROM 
19:59:54 THE APPRAISAL.
THE LAST QUESTION, AS FAR AS 
19:59:58 PEDESTRIAN AND BIKE, YOU KNOW, COULD YOU COMMENT ON THAT AS FAR AS HOW 
20:00:03 WE'RE MAKING IT  BIKE-FRIENDLY AND IMPROVING THE SITUATION THERE?

20:00:05 ?
>> Mr. Larsen: SO I THINK THERE'S -- I 
20:00:10 MEAN, THERE IS A SIDEWALK THAT BASICALLY SERVES THE FRONTAGE OF 
20:00:13 DEVELOPMENTS THAT ARE WITHIN THIS CORRIDOR.

20:00:17 THE PRIMARY ACCESS POINT OF THE TRAIL IS REALLY THROUGH THE DRIVEWAY.

20:00:24 SO ANYBODY RIDING THEIR BIKES DOWN NILES BOULEVARD THAT WANTS TO ACCESS 
20:00:30 THE TRAIL, THEY WILL BE ENTERING A LOW SPEED DRIVEWAY KIND OF ENVIRONMENT, 
20:00:36 AND THAT'S THE PRIMARY ACCESS POINT AND WHAT MOST PEOPLE WILL BE USING, AND 
20:00:40 THERE'S A NICE -- NOT TOO WIDE OF A DRIVEWAY, THE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO GO 
20:00:46 FAST IN IT, BUT CERTAINLY PROVIDES A GOOD QUALITY CONNECTION FROM THE 
20:00:52 PUBLIC STREET BACK TO THE CREEK TRAIL.
I JUST WANT TO ALERT THE CLERK THAT IF 
20:00:58 WE WANT TO BRING TERRY LARSEN, THE APPRAISER, TO ANSWER COUNCIL'S 
20:01:05 QUESTION, I'LL NEED TO BRING HIM ON TO THE PANEL AND NO RELATION BETWEEN MY 
20:01:10 NAME, HANS LARSEN, AND TERRY LARSON'S NAME.

20:01:16 I'M SEN, HE'S AN S-O-N.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU FOR THAT 
20:01:17 CLARIFICATION.
I'M GOING TO GO THROUGH SOME OF THE 
20:01:22 OTHER COUNCILMEMBERS' CLARIFYING QUESTIONS JUST SO IF WE HAVE ANYTHING 
20:01:26 WHEN WE DO BRING TERRY ON THAT WE CAN GET THEM ANSWERED COLLECTIVELY.

20:01:29 COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN.
>> Councilmember Kassan: I'M SORRY, 
20:01:32 WE'RE ON CLARIFYING QUESTIONS AND NOT COMMENTS AT THIS POINT?

20:01:35 >> Mayor Mei: WELL, YOU CAN ALSO MAKE COMMENTS TOO BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO 
20:01:40 BRING -- IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE'S A REQUEST FROM AT LEAST ONE OF OUR 
20:01:44 COUNCILMEMBERS TO BRIQ THE APPRAISER ON.

20:01:45 >> Councilmember Kassan: GREAT, THANK YOU.

20:01:49 I ACTUALLY DON'T DOUBT ANY OF THE THINGS THAT ARE BEING SAID IN TERMS OF 
20:01:56 THE APPRAISED VALUE BEING CORRECT BASED ON AN INDEPENDENT APPRAISAL, AND, YOU 
20:02:00 KNOW, THAT THERE WILL BE, YOU KNOW, EASEMENTS IN PLACE THAT WILL PROTECT 
20:02:05 PUBLIC ACCESS.
I THINK MY BIGGEST CONCERN IS JUST -- 
20:02:10 AND UNFORTUNATELY THE HORSES ARE OUT OF THE BARN, AND IT TOO LATE TO CLOSE THE 
20:02:14 BARN DOOR, BUT I JUST -- I REALLY WISH WE HAD NOT APPROVED THIS PROJECT 
20:02:19 BECAUSE IT JUST -- IT REALLY -- I DON'T THINK IT PROPERLY BALANCES THE 
20:02:23 BENEFITS TO THE PUBLIC THAT WE COULD HAVE ASKED FORGIVEN THAT THIS WAS A 
20:02:28 GENERAL PLAN AMENDMENT, AND ALL OF THE WORK THAT PEOPLE WENT THROUGH TO TRY 
20:02:31 TO MAKE THIS PROJECT MORE BENEFICIAL TO THE PUBLIC.

20:02:37 AND AS I'VE EXPRESSED BEFORE, AT LEAST THREE OF THE  COUNCILMEMBERS THAT 
20:02:42 VOTED FOR THIS DID RECEIVE MONEY FROM THE DEVELOPER, AND IT JUST -- I JUST 
20:02:49 FEEL LIKE IT'S VERY, VERY UNPLEASANT TO SEE THIS HAPPENING WHEN I WAS HOPING 
20:02:53 WE WOULD START TO SEE A SITUATION WHERE COUNCILMEMBERS WOULD NOT BE RECEIVING 
20:02:55 MONEY FROM DEVELOPERS WHOSE PROJECTS THEY WERE  APPROVING.

20:03:06 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
NEXT CLARIFYING COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS, 
20:03:09 COUNCILMEMBER COX.
FINAL COMMENTS, PLEASE.

20:03:13 THANK YOU.


20:03:16 >> Councilmember Cox: THANK YOU.
I WAS JUST WANTING TO FIND OUT, WITH 
20:03:24 THE EASEMENT, IS THERE SOME WORDING IN THIS ARRANGEMENT THAT WOULD ALSO HAVE 
20:03:29 SOME BUILT-IN SAFETY, ESPECIALLY IF THERE'S FAMILIES WITH KIDS THERE, AND 
20:03:35 JUST THINKING IN TERMS OF -- I KNOW IT PUBLIC ACCESS, BUT IS THERE SOME 
20:03:41 SAFETY FEATURES BUILT IN SINCE YOU HAVE EASEMENTS AND CHILDREN CAN BEING 
20:03:50 CHILDREN, AND EXPLORING.
>> Mr. Larsen: THE SAFETY WOULD BE 
20:03:59 RELATED TO FOLKS THAT ARE WALKING AND BIKING BACK TO THE TRAIL OR --

20:04:05 >> I GUESS BASED ON ANY OTHER ACCOMMODATIONS.

20:04:11 I DON'T KNOW IF THERE IS ANY TYPE OF THINGS TO KEEP PEOPLE MAINLY IN THAT 
20:04:21 PATH OF THE TRAIL OR IS IT JUST GOING TO BE -- IT'S UP TO THE PARENTS TO BE 
20:04:26 ABLE TO WATCH THEIR KIDS WALK THROUGH THE RAND THERE.

20:04:31  THE LAND THERE.
>> Mr. Larsen: I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN 
20:04:35 ANSWER THAT SPECIFICALLY, IF THERE'S ANYTHING THAT CAN BE DONE AS THE 
20:04:39 PROJECT GETS INTO SORT OF MORE DETAILED DESIGN THAT WE COULD DO TO THAT AND 
20:04:48 CERTAINLY HAVING SAFETY IN OUR WHOLE TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM, TRAIL SYSTEM, 
20:04:52 IS SOMETHING THAT WE'RE KEENLY FOCUSED ON, SO I THINK WE CAN TAKE THAT BACK 
20:05:00 AS WE WORK, IF THIS ACTION IS APPROVED AND THE PROJECT GOES FORWARD, THERE 
20:05:04 ARE SOME THINGS WE CAN DO, THROUGH THE IMPLEMENTATION PROCESS TO MAKE SURE 
20:05:10 THE CONNECTIVITY FROM THE PUBLIC STREET SYSTEM TO THE TRAIL SYSTEM IS DONE IN 
20:05:15 A CLEAR AND SAFE MANNER, SO WE'LL KIND OF TAKE THAT, APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS, 
20:05:20 AND WE USE THAT AS GUIDANCE AS WE WORK IN THE FUTURE.

20:05:22 >> Councilmember Cox: I APPRECIATE THAT.

20:05:26 UP WITH OTHER CLARIFICATION FOR THE APPRAISER, WAS THE APPRAISER AWARDED 
20:05:31 ON A SINGLE SOURCE OR A COMPETITIVE SOLICITATION?

20:05:37 >> Mr. Larsen: SO WE HAVE -- KIND OF TYPICALLY WHAT WE DO IN THIS CASE AND 
20:05:43 MAYBE TERRY CAN SPEAK TO IT IN TERMS OF WHAT'S STANDARD IN -- STANDARD 
20:05:48  PRACTICE, BUT SO WE HAVE A POOL OF APPRAISER THAT WE USE FOR THE WORK 
20:05:59 THAT WE DO THAT REQUIRES APPRAISALS, AND WE WANTED TO HAVE LENNAR WORK WITH 
20:06:04 SOMEBODY A WE'RE FAMILIAR WITH, THAT'S EXPERIENCED AND TRUSTWORTHY, BECAUSE 
20:06:08 WE DIDN'T WANT TO GET INTO THE BUSINESS OF KIND OF QUESTIONING SOME APPRAISER 
20:06:12 THAT WE'VE NEVER WORKED WITH.
SO ESSENTIALLY WE OFFER A LIST OF 
20:06:18 APPRAISERS THAT WE WORK WITH, AND THEN THEY CONTRACTED SEPARATELY WITH THEM 
20:06:23 TO BE ABLE TO COMPLETE THE WORK.
>> Councilmember Cox: OKAY, SO IT WAS 
20:06:33 A COMPETITIVE BID AND ENDED UP WITH YOUR QUALIFIED LIST, WHICH THEN LED TO 
20:06:36   CHOOSE -- THAT'S HOW THEY GOT SELECTED.

20:06:39 >> Mr. Larsen: CORRECT.
>> Councilmember Cox: SO THERE'S OPEN 
20:06:43 COMPETITION.
THANK YOU FOR THE CLARIFICATION TOO.

20:06:46 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
CLARIFYING QUESTIONS OR  COMMENTS, 
20:06:48 VICE MAYOR SHAO.
AND I'LL MAKE SOME COMMENTS 
20:06:49 AFTERWARDS.
>> Vice Mayor Shao: THANK YOU, MADAME 
20:06:52 MAYOR.
SINCE I ALREADY ASKED THE CLARIFYING 
20:06:53 QUESTIONS I WOULD LIKE TO OFFER MY COMMENTS.

20:06:58 AS I RECALL, ON THE MORNING OF APRIL 17TH, WHICH IS AT THE ANNUAL NILES 
20:07:06 CLEAN-UP, I RECALL THAT MAYOR MEI AND I WERE AMONG ALL THE VOLUNTEERS CLEANING 
20:07:13 UP ALONG THE NILES BOULEVARD AND ACTUALLY INTERESTINGLY AT THE END OF 
20:07:17 THAT MORNING, MAYOR MEI AND I WERE IN CHARGE OF THAT PART OF THE STREET.

20:07:27 I REMEMBER THERE WAS ANOTHER FAMILY OF YOUNG PARENTS ALSO JOINING US.

20:07:33 WE WERE TRYING TO CLEAN UP ALL THE BROKEN GLASSES ALONG THE ROAD, AMONG 
20:07:36 OTHER GARBAGE.
AND YOU CANNOT IMAGINE HOW MUCH 
20:07:37 GARBAGE WE ACTUALLY COLLECTED THAT MORNING.

20:07:45 I REMEMBER THAT WE HAVE TO CALL THE OTHER VOLUNTEERS TO COME UP AND PICK 
20:07:48 UP THE BAGS OF GARBAGE WITH THEIR PICKUP TRUCK.

20:07:56 SO I UNDERSTAND THAT THAT PART OF THE NILES BOULEVARD WAS CERTAINLY UNDER 
20:08:01 MAINTENANCE AND I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT IF WE DON'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT THAT PART 
20:08:07 OF THE ROAD, NEXT YEAR, WHEN WE COME BACK, WE'RE PROBABLY GOING TO DO THE 
20:08:11 SAME THING AGAIN FOR THE ANNUAL NILES CLEAN-UP.

20:08:23 SO I CAN FORESEE THAT CERTAINLY BY PRIVATIZING THIS PIECE OF LAND TO MAKE 
20:08:28 IT A PRIVATE STREET WOULD CERTAINLY MAKE THE CONDITION MUCH BETTER.

20:08:33 BUT ON THE OTHER HAND, AS I VOTED NO FOR THIS PROJECT, I FELT THAT THE 
20:08:41 BENEFIT THIS PROJECT INCLUDING THE PART OF THE STREET IS STILL -- IT COULD BE 
20:08:49 MORE TO THE -- YEAH, IT COULD HAVE BEEN MORE TO THE LOCAL RESIDENTS, SO FOR 
20:08:56 EXAMPLE, WITH THE ACCESS AND THE OTHER TRAIL PLAN THAT WE HAVE, I WOULD LIKE 
20:09:07 TO SEE MORE BEING SOLID, AND ENSURED THAT THE COMMUNITY OF NILES CAN REALLY 
20:09:14 ENJOY BY USING THIS ACCESS TO THE CREEK AND THE TRAILS.

20:09:24 AND FOR THE $10,000 APPRAISAL AMOUNT, I CERTAINLY THINK IF WE ARE ABLE TO COME 
20:09:31 UP WITH A  BETTER PLAN WITH THE DEVELOPER SO THAT THE CITY CAN ASK FOR 
20:09:39 MORE FOR THE LOCAL RESIDENTS ON THEIR BEHALF, SO THIS IS CERTAINLY WHAT I 
20:09:51 WANT TO SEE FOR THIS ITEM.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

20:09:56 DO WE WANT TO HEAR FROM THE APPRAISER FIRST AND I'LL MAKE MY COMMENTS 
20:09:57 AFTERWARDS.
IS HE READY TO GO?

20:09:59 WELCOME, TERRY.
>> I AM HERE.

20:10:03 THERE WERE A LOT OF THINGS THAT WERE MENTIONED ABOUT THE APPRAISAL, AND 
20:10:07 I'LL TRY NOT TO BE TOO LONG WITH THIS BUT ADDRESS THEM AS BEST AS I CAN, AS 
20:10:13 QUICKLY AS I CAN.
SO OUR COMPANY, WE APPRAISE PROPERTY 
20:10:17 FOR A LOT OF DIFFERENT CLIENTS, INCLUDING PUBLIC  AGENCIES, AND I WORK 
20:10:26 FOR BART AND VTA IN THE STATE OF C. AND WE WENT TO A LOT OF PUBLIC AGENCIES 
20:10:31 AND DOING WHAT WE CALL RIGHT-OF-WAY APPRAISAL WORK, APPRAISING STREETS AND 
20:10:34 RIGHT-OF-WAY PROPERTIES, SO FORTH, SOMEWHAT OF A SPECIALIZED NICHE IN OUR 
20:10:37 INDUSTRY.
AND WE DO A LOT OF THAT TYPE OF WORK.

20:10:46 IT'S VERY COMMON FOR PUBLIC AGENCIES TO REFER THEIR APPRAISERS OUT TO PRIVATE 
20:10:51 PROPERTY OWNERS, TO HAVE PROPERTY EVALUATED SINCE THE PUBLIC AGENCY IS 
20:10:56 AWARE OF THEIR HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE AND SO FORTH, SO THAT DOES HAPPEN 
20:10:59 QUITE FREQUENTLY.
I'VE BEEN APPRAISING FOR 40 YEARS IN 
20:11:03 NORTHERN CALIFORNIA, LIVE AND WORK IN THE EAST BAY SO I'VE DONE A LOT OF 
20:11:08 WORK  THROUGHOUT THE EAST BAY AND I'VE DONE A LOT OF WORK FOR THE CITY OF 
20:11:14 FREMONT.
I'M BELONG TO THE INTERNATIONAL 
20:11:17 RIGHT-OF-WAY ASSOCIATION.
SO OUR FIRM HAS THE QUALIFICATIONS AND 
20:11:20 EXPERTISE, AND I DO AS WELL, TO APPRAISE THIS KIND OF PROPERTY.

20:11:26 YOU ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT WHY THE VALUE IS ONLY $10,000.

20:11:28 THAT'S A VERY LEGITIMATE QUESTION TO ASK.

20:11:38 THE PROPERTY IS NOT BEING SOLD IN ITS ENTIRE INTEREST TO THE DEVELOPER.

20:11:48 IT'S BEING SOLD AND THE CITY IS MAINTAINING ITS PUBLIC INTEREST 
20:11:51 RIGHTS.
SO THE DEVELOPER IS NOT BUYING A FREE 
20:11:54 AND CLEAR PIECE OF LAND.
THEY CANNOT PUT BUILDINGS ON IT, SO 
20:11:58 WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THE ENCUMBRANCES ALREADY, SO THEY'RE REALLY BUYING 
20:12:03 HIGHLY ENCUMBERED LAND THAT CANNOT BE USED FOR ANYTHING OTHER THAN A STREET 
20:12:05 BASICALLY, WHICH IS CURRENTLY WHAT IT'S BEING USED FOR.

20:12:09 SO THEY REALLY GET NO ECONOMIC BENEFIT FROM THIS LAND, AND THE CITY AND THE 
20:12:13 PUBLIC REALLY ISN'T LOSING ANYTHING, THEY'RE MAINTAINING ALL OF THEIR 
20:12:15 RIGHTS OF ACCESS WHICH THEY CURRENTLY HAVE.

20:12:23 IN ADDITION TO THAT, THE  DEVELOPER IS REQUIRED TO -- AND MAINTAIN THIS 
20:12:26 STREET GOING FORWARD.
THE LAST FIGURES I SAW, IT'S GOING TO 
20:12:29 BE OVER $700,000 JUST TO DO THE IMPROVEMENTS ON THE STREET, AND THEN 
20:12:36 THEY HAVE TO MAINTAIN IT LONG TERM, WHICH WILL TAKE IT OFF OF THE CITY'S 
20:12:39 EXPENSE SIDE TO TAKE CARE OF THIS.
SO THE DEVELOPER REALLY IS TAKING ON 
20:12:44 QUITE A LIABILITY WITH THIS.
IT DOES PROVIDE THEM SOME SORT OF 
20:12:49 MARGINAL BENEFITS THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT ACCESS AND SOME OF THOSE THINGS, 
20:12:54 BUT THE COST AND THE MAINTENANCE IS PRETTY SIGNIFICANT GOING FORWARD.

20:12:58 THE DEVELOPER DOESN'T GET ANY ADDITIONAL UNITS FOR THAT LAND.

20:13:03 AND THE VALUE OF THE REAL  ESTATE, THE VALUE OF THE LAND IS ASSOCIATED WITH 
20:13:07 ITS USE, ITS UTILITY AND ITS DEVELOPMENT POTENTIAL.

20:13:13 CLEARLY IF THE DEVELOPER IS GOING TO PUT A BUNCH OF HOUSES, THAT'S WORTH A 
20:13:19 LOT MORE MONEY BUT IT GOING TO RAILROAD TRACK ON ONE SIDE, SO THE USE OF THIS 
20:13:23 TO BUILD HOUSES ON IS NOT VERY VIABLE.
AND THAT'S NOT THE PLAN, THAT'S NOT 
20:13:27 THE INTENTION.
THAT WOULD BE NOT ALLOWED ANYWAY 
20:13:31 BECAUSE IT'S GOING TO HAVE THESE INCOUPLE BRENSES AND VARIOUS THINGS 
20:13:37 RUNNING ACROSS THE PROPERTY.
SO LOOKING AT OUGHT THOSE  FACTORS 
20:13:41 WE'VE ALREADY DISCUSSED, THIS LAND DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY ECONOMIC BENEFIT TO 
20:13:45 THE DEVELOP EARLY, SO REALLY NO ECONOMIC VALUE THERE.

20:13:55 SO LOOKING AT THIS, I CAME UP WITH WHAT I CONSIDER A NOMINAL VALUE.

20:13:59 THERE'S SOME VALUE BEING ABLE TO CONTROL THE LAND IF SOMEBODY ELSE 
20:14:01 COULDN'T BUY IT AND DO SOMETHING WITH IT.

20:14:07  -- HAVE YOUR ACCESS RIGHTS AS I IS A.
THEY'RE ALSO BUILDING SOME PARKING 
20:14:13 SPACES ALONG THE STREET, AND I THINK THERE'S 15 PARKING SPACES OF WHICH I 
20:14:18 THINK 12 OR 13 OF THEM ARE BEING PUT IN FOR THE PUBLIC USE, TO PARK CARS, TO 
20:14:21 BE ABLE TO ACCESS THE TRAIL, SO AGAIN, THERE'S A PUBLIC BENEFIT THERE.

20:14:28 SO EVERYTHING -- THERE'S NOMINAL VALUE OF $10,000 FOR THIS PROPERTY IS FAIRLY 
20:14:37 REASONABLE.
>> Mr. Larsen: THANK YOU, TERRY.

20:14:40 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
AND THEN I'LL MAKE MY FINL COMMENTS 
20:14:42 AND IF ANYONE ELSE WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A MOTION.

20:14:46 SO I JUST WANTED TO NOTE THAT WHEN THIS PLAN ORIGINALLY CAME, WE HAD LOOKED AT 
20:14:51 SEVERAL DIFFERENT RENDITIONS OF  PROPOSALS AT THIS LOCATION, AND AT 
20:14:58 THIS ORIGINAL TIME, IT WAS VALLEY OAKS, WELL, THERE WERE I THINK SEVERAL 
20:15:02 DEVELOPERS BEFORE VALLEY OAKS, DOUG RICH AND NOW IT'S LENNAR.

20:15:08 ONE OF THE PROPOSALS WAS DEVELOPING A LINEAR PARK DOWN THERE, IF I'M 
20:15:11 CORRECT, HANS.
I'M NOT SURE IF YOU'RE STILL ON BUT 
20:15:13 I'M SURE YOU ARE.
THAT WAS ONE OF THE ORIGINAL 
20:15:17 PROPOSALS, WAS A LINEAR PARK, AND THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT THE PUBLIC HAD 
20:15:22 ASKED BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T WANT TO HAVE A LINEAR PARK THROUGH THERE TOO, SO 
20:15:26 WE'RE LOOKING AT A COMPLETE TRAILS PLAN THIS EVENING ALONG WITH OUR PARKS 
20:15:28 DISCUSSION, IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO CONTINUE THIS.

20:15:31 I KNOW THERE'S ALWAYS BEEN DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW TO HAVE SAFE ACCESS.

20:15:41 I HAD ORIGINALLY PROPOSED BACK THERE BECAUSE WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE IF 
20:15:48 THERE WAS AN EMERGENCY, TO HAVE ABILITY FOR INGRESS OR EGRESS, BUT THAT WOULD 
20:15:52 BE THE ONLY MAJOR CONCERN I HAD THERE.
SO, THEREFORE, I HAVE BEEN ON THIS 
20:15:56 PIECE OF LAND MANY DIFFERENT WAYS, WALKING AND DRIVING AND PARKING OVER 
20:16:04 THERE FOR THE YEARS -- BUT IN PARTICULAR, I DO CONCUR WITH 
20:16:09 COUNCILMEMBER SHAO, WHEN WE PARTICIPATED IN THE NAN YOU'LL NILES 
20:16:13 TALENT CLEAN-UP, THERE IS SOMETHING UNFORTUNATELY THAT WAS JUST COVERED IN 
20:16:15 GLASS AND MANY OTHER THINGS THAT WERE NOT AS POSITIVE THERE.

20:16:20 IT IS SOMETHING THAT BECAUSE OF IT'S A LITTLE BIT OFF THE BEATEN PATH, THAT 
20:16:25 HAS BEEN USED SOMETIMES IN NOT THE MOST BENEFICIAL PUBLIC BENEFIT AND THIS 
20:16:31 TYPE OF OPPORTUNITY TO CLEAN IT UP AND CONNECT TO THE COMMUNITY, AND I WOULD 
20:16:37 BE  OPEN -- DIFFERENCE OF A 4-FOOT TRAIL VERSUS A 5-FOOT TRAIL, IF THAT 
20:16:41 WAS A HUGE ISSUE, A DIFFERENCE OF A FOOT I DON'T THINK SHOULD MAKE A 
20:16:44 DIFFERENCE.
WE CAN ALWAYS ASK THE DEVELOPER AND IF 
20:16:48 THERE'S ENOUGH WILL ON THE COUNCIL, I DON'T THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE A BIG 
20:16:51 ASK.
BECAUSE ULTIMATELY WE WANT PEOPLE TO 
20:16:53 BE SAFE AND TO BE -- I MEAN, THE OTHER THING I COULD THINK OF BACK THERE 
20:16:57 PROBABLY RIGHT NOW THERE'S NOT AS MUCH LIGHTING, AND SO THAT WOULD BE 
20:17:02 SOMETHING THAT WE COULD ALSO SAY TO HAVE IT WELL LIT SO THAT IT'S A SAFE 
20:17:04 TRAIL.
SO I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S ANY OTHER 
20:17:08 COMMENTS FROM THE COUNCIL AT THIS TIME, THE PUBLIC COMMENT IS CLOSED ACTUALLY, 
20:17:11 SO I'LL TURN IT BACK.
I SEE COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN.

20:17:14 WOULD YOU LIKE TO MAKE A MOTION OR MAKE A COMMENT?

20:17:16 >> Councilmember Salwan: SURE, MADAME MAYOR.

20:17:21 I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A MOTION BECAUSE I BELIEVE THIS IS THE BEST USE OF THIS 
20:17:25 LAND.
IT WILL ALLOW US TO UTILIZE THIS LAND, 
20:17:28 UPGRADE IT, MAINTAIN SAFETY, AND HAVE A PERMANENT SOLUTION FOR IT.

20:17:34 AND THE REASON I SUPPORT IT IS NOT BECAUSE OF CONTRIBUTIONS OR ANYTHING, 
20:17:38 BECAUSE THE REASON I SUPPORT IT IS BECAUSE THIS IS THE BEST USE OF THE 
20:17:41 LAND, AND THIS IS THE BEST USE OF THIS LAND, AND THEN THIS PROJECT IS THE 
20:17:47 BEST PROJECT WE HAVE FOR THIS PARCEL.
A BIRD IN HAND IS WORTH TWO IN THE 
20:17:49 BUSH.
WE HAVE SOMETHING THAT'S READY TO GO 
20:17:53 THAT SOMEBODY WANTS TO IMPROVE THIS PROPERTY, WANT TO MAKE IT BETTER, AND 
20:17:57 I THINK THIS IS THE RIGHT THING.
AND I HAVE ALWAYS FILED A FULL 
20:18:06 DISCLOSURES, TRANSPARENT, NEVER HAVE HAD ANY VIOLATIONS AND ALWAYS 
20:18:07 DISCLOSED ANY FUNDS THAT I HAVE EVER RECEIVED.

20:18:13 AND SO I THINK TO QUESTION SOMEONE'S MOTIVE FOR HOW THEY VOTE, I THINK 
20:18:16 THAT'S GOING A LITTLE FAR.
I DON'T THINK ANYBODY CAN BUY ANY ONE 
20:18:19 OF OUR VOTES.
AND IF SOMEBODY FEELS THAT THEIR VOTE 
20:18:22 CAN BE BOUGHT, THEN THEY SHOULD NOT BE ON CITY COUNCIL.

20:18:30 SO I FOR ONE FEEL THAT THIS IS THE BEST PROJECT AT THE BEST SITE, AND WE DID 
20:18:33 IT FOR THE RIGHT REASON, AND THIS IS GOING TO BE THE BEST THING FOR THE 
20:18:35 CITY.
SO WITH THAT, I WOULD MAKE A MOTION TO 
20:18:36 APPROVE THIS.
THANK YOU.

20:18:38 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
WE HAVE A MOTION.

20:18:41 AND WE HAVE A SECOND FROM COUNCILMEMBER JONES.

20:18:48 THANK YOU.
ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE.

20:18:53 >> Ms. Gauthier: COUNCILMEMBER COX, AYE.

20:18:59 COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN, AYE.
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, NO.

20:19:06 COUNCILMEMBER JONES, AYE.
COUNCILMEMBER KENG, AYE.

20:19:14 VICE MAYOR SHAO, AYE.
MAYOR MEI, AYE.

20:19:19 I ALSO JUST WANTED TO MAKE ONE OTHER COMMENT, IS THAT DURING THE DIFFERENT 
20:19:22 VERSIONS THAT WE'VE SEEN, I THINK THE HOUSING UNITS PROPOSED AT ONE POINT 
20:19:24 WERE UP TO 200 UNITS AND NOW THIS IS 75.

20:19:29 I ALSO THINK THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF DISCUSSIONS ABOUT HOW WE CAN TRY TO 
20:19:33 REVITALIZE OUR DISTRICTS, OUR NEIGHBORHOOD DISTRICTS AND HAVING 
20:19:35 STOREFRONTS AND HAVING PEOPLE THAT CAN SUPPORT THE COMMUNITY.

20:19:40 I THINK HAVING SEEN THIS AREA AS UNFORTUNATELY GONE THROUGH MANY STAGES 
20:19:47 UNFORTUNATELY NOW SOME BLIGHT THERE, WE ARE TRYING VERY HARD TO ENSURE THAT, 
20:19:50 ONE, WE'RE MEETING OUR HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT IN A WAY THAT WILL BENEFIT 
20:19:55 OUR COMMUNITY AND HELP TO DRIVE MORE BUSINESSES TO OUR COMMUNITY AND TO 
20:19:59 CREATE THAT SENSE OF COHESION AND HAVING THAT TRAIL DISCUSSION WHICH 
20:20:04 WILL CONTINUE SHORTLY, IT IS 8:20 AND I APOLOGIZE RIGHT NOW BECAUSE WE HAVE A 
20:20:07 STENOCAPTIONER AND EVERY HOUR AND A HALF, I NEED TO GIVE THEM A BREAK, AND 
20:20:12 I HAVE A FEELING THAT SOME OF OUR AGENDA ITEMS WILL GO MORE THAN 10 
20:20:17 MINUTES SO THEREFORE I'M GOING TO TAKE A QUICK 10-MINUTE BREAK, RETURNING AT 
20:20:20 8:30.
AT THIS TIME, I'D LIKE TO ASK THOSE 
20:20:24 WHO ARE ON TO PLEASE MUTE AND TURN OFF YOUR VIDEO UNTIL WE RETURN.

20:20:26 THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING YOU AT 
20:20:55 8:30.


20:20:55 


20:20:55 


20:28:24 
[ Recess ]

20:29:46 [ Recess ]
>> Mayor Mei:   Hello I'll give 

20:29:49 us a minute while we all return.
Welcome back from our break.

20:30:41 NEXT IS OUR 7A, UPDATE ON THE 
PARKS AND RECREATION MASTER 

20:30:49 PLAN.
WE HAVE NEELAY BHAZT OF PROS 

20:30:53 CONSULTING.
>> I'M SUZANNE WOLF COMMUNITY 

20:30:56 SERVICES DIRECTOR AND IT'S A 
PLEASURE TO BE HERE WITH YOU 

20:30:59 THIS EVENING.
ALONG WITH OUR MASTER PLAN WE 

20:31:03 WILL BE GIVING A FOCUS ON OUR 
PRIORITY RATINGS OF OUR 

20:31:06 STATISTICALLY VALID SURVEY WITH 
HOW THAT IMPACTS WITH OUR 

20:31:12 UNDERSTANDING OF THE SAMPLING OF 
THE BENCHMARK ASSESSMENT DATA 

20:31:16 OUR LEVEL OF SERVICE AND EQUITY 
PLANNING SERVICE WITH YOU THIS 

20:31:20 EVENING.
IT'S MY PLEASURE TO INTRODUCE 

20:31:26 NEELAY BHATT HERE TO PROVIDE THE 
DRAFT UPDATES TO YOU.

20:31:30 NEELAY.
>> THANK YOU SUZANNE AND GOOD 

20:31:33 EVENING EVERYBODY.
CAN IT'S GREAT TO SEE ALL OF YOU 

20:31:40 IS AGAIN AS WELL.
AND I KNOW WE SHARED SOME OF THE 

20:31:43 FINDINGS FROM THE PLAN LAST TIME 
AS WELL SO I'M GOING TO GO 

20:31:46 STRAIGHT INTO IT HERE.
SOME OF THE THINGS WE'VE DONE 

20:31:51 THE LAST TIME WE SPOKE WAS 
ASSESS KIM AND HER TEAM AND 

20:31:56 SUZANNE AND HER TEAM AS WELL, 
PROGRAM, RECREATION ASPECT AND A 

20:32:00 VARIETY OF DIFFERENT CORE 
PROGRAM AREAS WERE LOOKED AT FOR 

20:32:03 EVERYTHING FROM THE EIGHT 
SEGMENTS THEY SERVE TO THE 

20:32:07 CLASSIFICATION AND LIFE CYCLES 
THEY'RE IN AS WELL AS HOW WE 

20:32:10 MARKET, PROMOTE, GET VOLUNTEERS 
AND MEASURE THE PROGRAMS.

20:32:14 AND THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS WILL 
BE IN THE ACTUAL REPORT.

20:32:18 THEY WERE DRIVEN BY WHAT SUZANNE 
JUST REFERENCED, PRIORITY 

20:32:24 INVESTMENT RATINGS FOR PROGRAM 
AREAS PARTICULARLY, AND THE 

20:32:26 SURVEY CALCULATES THIS BASED ON 
THIS COMBINATION OF WHAT IS 

20:32:34 IMPORTANT DO YOUR COMMUNITY, AND 
FROM THAT, WHAT IS AN UNMET 

20:32:36 NEED.
WHAT YOU SEE THEY VERY TOP IN 

20:32:38 RED ARE THINGS WE DISCUSSED LAST 
TIME.

20:32:42 THESE ARE THE HIGH LEVEL UNMET 
NEEDS AND IMPORTANCE 

20:32:44 COMBINATIONS.
IT IS FAIRLY STANDARD, IN MOST 

20:32:47 COMMUNITIES WE'LL SEE SOME 
COMBINATION OF SPECIAL EVENTS, 

20:32:52 ADULT AND SENIOR FITNESS AND 
WELLNESS AND/OR EXERCISES BEING 

20:32:55 CONSISTENT BEHIND.
THE HISTORIC PARK PROGRAMS, 

20:32:59 GIVEN THE NUMBER OF HISTORIC 
PARKS YOU HAVE AS WELL AS HOW DO 

20:33:03 YOU PROMOTE THAT, AND THE 
CULTURAL PROGRAMS GIVEN RICH 

20:33:05 DIVERSITY OF THE COMMUNITY ARE 
ONES I WOULD EXPECT TO ALSO BE 

20:33:10 HIGH IN THIS CASE.
THIS IS OBVIOUSLY EMPIRICAL DATA 

20:33:14 SO THIS IS THE ONLY COMPONENT OF 
THE REPORT I WOULD SAY IS IN 

20:33:17 ESSENTIALLY FINAL FORMAT.
EVERYTHING ELSE AS SUZANNE SAID 

20:33:20 IS DRAFT AND WE'RE WORKING 
THROUGH WITH THE STAFF LOOKING 

20:33:22 TO GET FEEDBACK AND ITERATE AS 
WE GO.

20:33:27 SO THAT LEADS ME TO THE 
BENCHMARK AND A COMPARISON AS 

20:33:31 WELL.
OBVIOUSLY, RECOGNIZING YOUR 

20:33:34 STATUS AS A GENERAL LAW CITY AND 
ALSO LOOKING AT YOUR ASPIRATIONS 

20:33:43 AS A NATIONAL GOLD MEDAL AND A 
NATIONALLY CROORD AGENCY AS 

20:33:48 WELL, OTHERS SUCH AS RECREATION 
IN INDIANA AND NOR SPHOAK IN 

20:33:53 VIRGINIA WHO ARE NATIONAL GOLD 
MEDAL WINNERS OR FINALISTS WHICH 

20:33:57 WE COUNTED AS PEER AGENCIES.
WE CREATED THE BENCHMARK 

20:34:00 TEMPLATES.
THE QUESTIONS THAT WENT IN 

20:34:01 THERE.
STAFF REACHED OUT TO THE 

20:34:04 CALIFORNIA AGENCIES AND THE 
INFORMATION WE GOT FROM THEM IS 

20:34:11 ESSENTIALLY AS WE GOT, RIGHT?
ANY BENCHMARK, ANY TIME WE DO IS 

20:34:15 ALWAYS PART ART, PART SCIENCE 
BECAUSE EVERY AGENCY MAY 

20:34:16 CALCULATE DATA SLIGHTLY 
DIFFERENTLY.

20:34:20 BUT THE OVERARCHING THEMES OF 
WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IN THIS 

20:34:24 CASE IS JUST AS A COMBINATION OF 
OVERALL PARK ACREAGES AND SITES 

20:34:27 BASED ON THE POPULATION, OF 
COURSE, YOU KNOW, THESE NUMBERS, 

20:34:32 THE NATIONAL NUMBERS ARE NOT 
VERY TYPICAL WHEN IT COMES TO 

20:34:34 CALIFORNIA.
IN THE MIDWEST, 15 ACRES PER 

20:34:39 THOUSAND IS VERY COMMON.
IN CALIFORNIA WE TRY TO GET A 

20:34:43 QUIMBY WITH OVER FIVE ACRES 
WHICH IS SORT OF WHERE WE ARE IN 

20:34:46 THIS CASE.
OPERATING EXPENSES AS WELL, THIS 

20:34:50 AGAIN IS ONLY LOOKING AT 
COMMUNITY SERVICES DEPARTMENT 

20:34:52 SPENDING NOT THE HUMAN SERVICES 
SIDE.

20:34:56 THAT COVERS A SIGNIFICANT 
PORTION OF YOUR COMMUNITY.

20:34:59 WHEREAS FOR ALL THE OTHERS THEY 
ALSO HAVE ALL THE OFFERINGS 

20:35:03 TOWARDS THE AGE WELL OF THE 
SENIOR CENTER AND SENIOR 

20:35:06 PROGRAMMINGS INCLUDED IN THE 
TOTAL EXPENSES.

20:35:10 JUST SOMETHING TO KEEP IN MIND.
FROM A REVENUE STANDPOINT, YOUR 

20:35:16 TEAM DOES AN EXCEPTIONAL JOB 
FOCUSING ON COST RECOVERY AND 

20:35:18 MAXIMIZING WHAT THEY CAN DO AS 
WE CAN LOOK AT THE NUMBERS HERE 

20:35:23 AS WELL.
THE REASON A COUPLE OF THESE 

20:35:31 COUPLE COSUMNES AREA AROUND 
SACRAMENTO, ARE DOING 

20:35:36 PARTICULARLY WELL BECAUSE THEY 
HAVE LARGE RECREATION CENTERS 

20:35:41 AND A WATER PARK WHICH OFTEN 
LEAD TO A MUCH HIGHER NONTAX 

20:35:45 GENERATION AS WELL.
IF I DON'T ADD THOSE, FREMONT 

20:35:48 AND WHAT YOUR DEAM DOES IS AMONG 
THE BEST OF THE BEST AND AS WHAT 

20:35:53 YOU CAN SEE MORE THAN TWICE WHAT 
THE NATIONAL MEDIAN IS IN THIS 

20:35:56 CASE.
JUST A BREAKDOWN OF THE CAPITAL 

20:35:59 EXPENSES OVER THE LAST FIVE 
YEARS AND THE AVERAGE SPENDING 

20:36:09 AS WELL, SANTA CLARITA HAD A 
BOND RECENTLY, SIGNIFICANTLY 

20:36:13 HIGHER IN THIS CASE AND FROM A 
PROGRAM PARTICIPATION STANDPOINT 

20:36:17 THIS IS WHERE THERE IS ROOM TO 
GROW IN TERMS OF THE NUMBER OF 

20:36:19 UNIQUE PARTICIPATIONS PER 
RESIDENT OF FREMONT.

20:36:26 BUT PART OF THE CHALLENGE IS THE 
LACK OF INDOOR SPACES THAT CAN 

20:36:30 ALLOW FOR MULTIPLE USES.
YOU DO HAVE A NUMBER OF 

20:36:33 SMALLER -- HAVE A NUMBER OF 
BUILDINGS BUT THEY ARE TYPICALLY 

20:36:38 SMALLER IN SIZE.
AND THAT RESULTS TO SOME DEGREE 

20:36:44 IN TERMS OF THE PROGRAM 
PARTICIPATIONS.

20:36:51 THIS IS WHERE I MENTION THE, 
JUST TRACKS UNIQUE PARTICIPANTS.

20:36:58 SO THEIR NUMBER IS 6400 
PARTICIPANTS THAT GET THE 

20:37:01 PARTICIPATION IN THE PROGRAM BUT 
IF I GO TO THE REC CENTER 16 

20:37:05 TIMES A YEAR, THEY STILT COUNT 
THAT AS ONCE AND NOT 16 TIMES 

20:37:08 WHICH IS WHY THEIR NUMBER IS 
SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER HERE.

20:37:12 AND THIS SORT OF CORROBORATES 
WHO I TALK ABOUT IN TERMS OF 

20:37:14 INDOOR RECREATION SQUARE 
FOOTAGE.

20:37:19 WE HAVE A NUMBER OF BUILDINGS 
YOU KNOW COMMUNITY BUILDINGS, 

20:37:23 RECREATION BUILDINGS, ET CETERA, 
AS WELL BUT THE OVERALL TOTAL 

20:37:31 SQUARE FOOTAGE IS LESS THAN HALF 
A SQUARE FOOT PER PERSON.

20:37:39 BEST PRACTICES NATIONALLY EVEN 
ACCOUNTING FOR WEATHER AND ALL 

20:37:44 THE REST TOO, THAT'S WHERE YOU 
SEE CLOSE TO 1.5 SQUARE FOOT PER 

20:37:52 PERSON OR HIGHER IS WHERE A 
NUMBER OF THESE BEST PRACTICES 

20:37:54 AGENCIES WOULD BE AS WELL.
THIS IS WHERE DID SECOND ASPECT 

20:37:57 OF PRIORITY INVESTMENT RATINGS 
COMES IN.

20:38:00 WHERE WE LOOK AT THE SAME 
QUESTION BUT NOW FOR FACILITY 

20:38:03 AND AMENITIES.
SO THIS ENTIRE LIST WAS PROVIDED 

20:38:13 TO W SURVEY RESPONDENTS, DO YOU 
HAVE A NEED, YES OR NO IS YOUR 

20:38:17 NEED BEING MET?
ANYTHING AT 50% OR LESS IS AN 

20:38:19 UNMET NEED AND WE ASK FOR 
IMPORTANCE AND BASED ON THAT 

20:38:23 WHAT YOU CAN SEE WHICH AA LOT OF 
THIS TRANSVERY SIMILAR TO WHAT 

20:38:29  
THIS TRACKS VERY SIMILAR, IN THE 

20:38:33 COMMUNITY INPUT AS WELL, HOW 
MUCH YOUR COMMUNITY TRAILS AND 

20:38:38 CONNECT CANNISTS, ANOTHER TRAILS 
PLAN IS COMING UP IT IS A GOOD 

20:38:44 SEGUE, AND ALSO SMALL AND LARGE 
NEIGHBORHOOD PARKS AS WELL AS 

20:38:48 RESTROOMS.
WE'RE SEEING A LOT MORE FOCUS ON 

20:38:53 RESTROOMS, SHADE STRUCTURES AND 
COMMUNITY CENTERS.

20:38:58 IF YOU LOOK AT YOUR TOP SEVEN OR 
EIGHT, THAT IS REALLY THE LARGE 

20:39:00 GIST START TRAILS AND 
CONNECTIVITY.

20:39:05 SMALL TO MEDIUM-SIZED PARKS, 
AMENITY SUCH AS SHARED AND 

20:39:09 RESTROOMS AND THERE IS BALANCE 
BETWEEN OPEN SPACE AND 

20:39:12 CONSERVATION AREAS VERSUS YEAR 
ROUND RECREATION AS WELL.

20:39:16 SO WITH THAT IN MIND THEN, YOU 
KNOW, OF COURSE THE TRAILS 

20:39:20 COMPONENTS HERE ARE 25 DIFFERENT 
TRAIL CORRIDORS WERE ALSO 

20:39:23 ASSESSED AS A PART OF THIS IN 
THE TRAILS PLAN AND THEY WILL BE 

20:39:25 SHARING MORE INFORMATION WITH 
YOU.

20:39:27 AS YOU SEE THE TRAILS PLAN GO 
FORWARD.

20:39:31 BUT THAT LED US TO CRAFTING THE 
INVENTORY.

20:39:34 AND THIS IS VERY, VERY A WORK IN 
PROGRESS AS WE GO THROUGH.

20:39:38 BUT THE IDEA WAS, YOU KNOW, 
YOU'VE GROWN SO MUCH IN THE LAST 

20:39:43 PLAN, AND THERE'S NEVER BEEN ALL 
THIS SORT OF COMPREHENSIVE 

20:39:46 INVENTORY CAPTURED IN ONE PLACE.
SO A TEAM ACTUALLY WENT TO EVERY 

20:39:48 PARK.
YOU KNOW WORKING WITH THE 

20:39:52 COMMUNITY SERVICES STAFF AS 
WELL, DO LOOK AT WHAT DOES THE 

20:39:55 CITY PROVIDE, BUT ALSO, WHAT 
DOES YOUR COMMUNITY HAVE ACCESS 

20:39:58 TO BEYOND THE CITY?
SO WE LOOK AT OHLONE COLLEGE, WE 

20:40:03 LOOK AT OTHER NON-CITY OWNED 
OFFERINGS, WE LOOK AT EAST BAY 

20:40:07 BECAUSE, WE DON'T WANT YOU TO 
HAVE TO BE ALL THINGS TO ALL 

20:40:09 PEOPLE.
THE IDEA IS AS LONG AS THERE IS 

20:40:12 ACCESS TO THE COMMUNITY FOR A 
VARIETY OF OFFERINGS THEN THAT'S 

20:40:17 WHERE THE CITY CAN COMPLEMENT 
THEM AND NOT DUPLICATE 

20:40:19 RESOURCES.
SO THAT'S HOW WE CAN CAPTURE ALL 

20:40:23 THE INVENTORY THAT'S PROVIDED 
ACROSS MULTIPLE PROVIDERS.

20:40:26 YOU CAN SEE ALL OF THESE 
DIFFERENT PARK TYPES.

20:40:30 SO, YOU KNOW, AS WE LOOKED AT 
CREATING CONSISTENCY, IN THIS AS 

20:40:36 WELL, COMBINING NEIGHBORHOOD 
MINI CIVIC HISTORIC NEAR PARKS 

20:40:42 IN THE NAKED, COMMUNITY PARKS, 
CENTRAL PARK IS REALLY A 

20:40:45 DESTINATION PARK REALLY, AND YOU 
HAVE EAST BAY AND REGIONAL PARK 

20:40:48 SPACES AND ALL ARE AMENITIES 
THAT WE BUILD IN AS WELL TO 

20:40:53 CAPTURE WHAT YOU HAVE, WITH THEN 
THE INDOOR AMENITIES AS WELL.

20:41:01 SO THE WAYBILL THIS DATA IS UP 
THE WAY WE ARE FINALIZING, YOU 

20:41:04 HAVE A CURRENT LEVEL OF SERVICE 
BASED ON THE COMMUNITY RESULTS 

20:41:09 AND THE PRIORITY INVESTMENT WE 
HAVE RECOMMENDED ONCE AND THAT 

20:41:12 THEN TELLS US GOING FORWARD 
WHERE YOU DO MEET THE STANDARDS, 

20:41:14 OR WHERE NEEDS EXIST FOR THE 
FUTURE.

20:41:17 SO THIS GIVES YOU A GOOD SENSE 
OF QUANTITY.

20:41:21 BUT IT DOESN'T TELL YOU, YOU 
KNOW, IN TERMS OF LOCATION AS 

20:41:23 WELL.
SO THAT TELLS YOU HOW MANY.

20:41:28 THE NEXT PIECE WHAT WE'RE DOING 
IS GIS BASED MAPPING TO SHOW YOU 

20:41:31 PERHAPS WHERE THOSE GAPS MIGHT 
BE.

20:41:34 SO THE MAPS ARE BEING DEVELOPED 
AS WE SPEAK.

20:41:36 BUT WE WANTED TO GIVE YOU THE 
SNEAK PEEK.

20:41:41 SO THIS IS HOT OFF THE PRESS.
TONAL STAFF HAS GOT AN CHANCE TO 

20:41:44 SEE THIS.
SO FOR ALL OF YOUR EYES ONLY 

20:41:47 THESE ARE SOME OF THE MAPS THAT 
WE REALLY WANTED TO SHOW YOU 

20:41:51 FIRST TO BE ABLE TO SAY WHERE 
ARE OUR DIFFERENT -- SO THIS IS 

20:41:54 NEIGHBORHOOD PARKS.
THE WAY I SEE THESE MAPS, IF YOU 

20:41:57 LOOK AT THE BOTTOM, THAT'S THE 
LEGEND.

20:41:59 EVERYTHING IN GREEN IS CITY OF 
FREMONT.

20:42:01 THE OTHERS ARE NONCITY OWNED 
SITES.

20:42:06 IN SOME OTHER MAPS WE HAVE THE 
OHLONE COLLEGE ONES OR EAST BAY 

20:42:10 PARKS WHETHER WE DO THE REGIONAL 
PARK MAPS, DID DOT IN THE CENTER 

20:42:12 IS THE ACTUAL LOCATION OF THE 
PARK.

20:42:17 AND THIS IS BASED ON POPULATION, 
GIVEN THE POPULATION DENSITIES, 

20:42:21 SO WE HAVE ESTABLISHED THIS 
STANDARD OF .7 ACRES PER 

20:42:24 THOUSAND.
SO IF YOU HAD A PARK THAT WAS .7 

20:42:29 ACRES IN SIZE, THIS RING WOULD 
ESSENTIALLY GO ON A CONCENTRIC 

20:42:33 CIRCLE UNTIL IT CAPTURES EXACTLY 
1,000 PEOPLE, RIGHT?

20:42:37 SO IF LARGER THE PARK OR THE 
MORE DENSER THE POPULATION, THE 

20:42:41 SMALLER THE RING IS GOING TO BE 
OR LARGER DEPENDING ON PARK SIZE 

20:42:45 AND ALL THE REST, RIGHT?
SO THAT'S HOW ALL OF THESE ARE 

20:42:47 BUILT.
NOW AT FIRST GLANCE THIS MAY 

20:42:51 SEEM LIKE THERE REALLY AREN'T 
MANY GAPS.

20:42:55 BUT AS YOU LOOK IN CLOSER, LOOK 
RIGHT IN THE HEART OF DOWNTOWN 

20:43:00 AS WELL AAND YOU'LL START SEEING 
SOME GAPS .

20:43:03 AS I LOOK CLOSER TO IRVINGTON 
PLAZA AND JUST EAST HERE AS WELL 

20:43:05 YOU'RE GOING TO SEE SOME MORE 
GAPS AS WELL.

20:43:10 AND PART OF THE PART HERE IS WE 
WANT TO BALANCE THIS EQUITY WITH 

20:43:14 ALSO THE TEN-MINUTE WALK.
I KNOW YOU ARE ONE OF THE VERY 

20:43:19 FIRST CITIES TO SIGN ON TO THE 
TEN-MINUTE WALK PLEDGE WHICH IS 

20:43:22 PHENOMENAL AND I'VE USED YOUR 
EXAMPLE IN MANY PLACES AS WELL.

20:43:24 SO THAT'S GREAT.
AND SO WE WANT TO BALANCE THIS 

20:43:29 IN TERMS OF SHOWING BASED ON 
DENSITY OF POPULATION, WHERE THE 

20:43:33 PARKS COVERAGES ARE, WITH ALSO 
WHAT KIND OF ACCESS DO PEOPLE 

20:43:37 HAVE.
SO HERE'S AN EXAMPLE OF 

20:43:39 NEIGHBORHOOD PARKS, HERE IS 
ANOTHER FOR COMMUNITY PARKS.

20:43:43 AS CAN YOU IMAGINE IN SOME CASES 
WHAT MIGHT BE A NEIGHBORHOOD 

20:43:46 PARK FOR SOME BECOMES A 
COMMUNITY PARK FOR THE OTHER AS 

20:43:57 WELL OR VICE VERSA DEPENDING ON 
WHERE SOMEBODY MIGHT LIVE.

20:44:03 THEY ARE DEPENDENT ON A SOMEWHAT 
LONGER STAY.

20:44:07 MAPS THEMSELVES, I WON'T TELL 
YOU YOU'RE UNDERSERVED FOR 

20:44:10 PICKLE BALL COURTS.
BUT THIS IS ONE OF THE FASTEST 

20:44:12 GREG SPORTS WE SEE IN THE 
CURRENT.

20:44:17 SO JUST LOOK AT HOW YOU SEE 
BALANCING SOME OF THESE IN TERMS 

20:44:21 OF GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION, A 
PICKLE BALL FOR DOG PARKS AS 

20:44:24 WELL, WE'VE SEEN A SIGNIFICANT 
INCREASE IN DOG PARKS AND JUST 

20:44:26 PETS IN GENERAL IN THE LAST FEW 
YEARS.

20:44:30 WHAT DOES THAT TRANSLATES TO?
AND THEN INDOOR COMMUNITY AND 

20:44:34 RECREATION BUILDINGS.
AGAIN, THIS ALSO INCLUDES AGE 

20:44:37 WELL CENTERS, I HAVE MARKED THEM 
WITH DIFFERENT COLORS AS YOU CAN 

20:44:40 SEE.
BECAUSE WHILE THEY ARE INDOOR 

20:44:44 REC FACILITIES AS YOU VERY WELL 
KNOW, IT SERVES ONLY A SELECT 

20:44:48 PORTION OF YOUR COMMUNITY AND 
NOT THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY.

20:44:52 SO WANTED TO SHOW ALL OF THESE 
HERE, WE'LL HAVE EVERY SINGLE 

20:44:56 AMENITY AND THE MAPS DONE.
BUT THIS IS WHAT THEY'RE GOING 

20:45:00 TO LOOK LIKE AND THIS WILL 
ULTIMATELY HELP STAFF RECOMMEND 

20:45:12 FUTURE R ACQUISITIONS, EQUITY OF 
ACCESS FROM IT COMES TO 

20:45:15 NEIGHBORHOOD PARKS, ALSO A TEN 
MINUTE WALK WHEN WITH IT COMES 

20:45:18 TO AMENITIES IN GENERAL, 
EQUITABLE ACCESS THROUGHOUT CITY 

20:45:23 AS WELL.
SO THAT LEADS US TO SORT OF THE 

20:45:26 FINAL STEPS HERE BASED ON ALL OF 
THIS.

20:45:29 AND THE ASSESSMENT OF INDIVIDUAL 
SITES, THE CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT 

20:45:32 PLAN AND THE FINANCIAL AND 
FUNDING STRATEGIES WILL BE 

20:45:35 DEVELOPED USING ALL OF THAT 
WE'LL WORK WITH THE STAFF TO 

20:45:41 CREATE THE THE DRAFT OF THE 
VISION, MISSION, VALUES AND BIG 

20:45:43 MOVES AND ACTION APALESTINE.
WE'LL BRING THAT TO YOU THE 

20:45:47 COMMISSIONS AND THE COUNCIL FOR 
REVIEW AND FEEDBACK, GET 

20:45:53 COMMUNITY INPUT AS WELL AND UPON  
APPROVAL, THAT SEARNTION BECOMES 

20:45:57 A FINAL DOCUMENT THAT YOU WILL 
ADOPT AS WELL AND THAT BECOMES 

20:45:58 YOUR LIVING BREETDING MASTER 
PLAN.

20:46:03 I'M GOING TO PAUSE HERE.
I KNOW I'VE SHARED A LOT IN 

20:46:06 ABOUT TEN OR 12 MINUTES AND I'M 
HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS, 

20:46:08 COMMENTS, FEEDBACK THAT YOU MAY 
HAVE.

20:46:12 >> Mayor Mei:   WE'RE GOING TO 
BEGIN FIRST WITH QUESTIONS FROM 

20:46:16 THE COUNCIL, FOR CLARIFYING 
QUESTIONS AND THEN WE'LL OPEN UP 

20:46:20 THE PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD.
SO OQUESTION FROM COUNCILMEMBER 

20:46:23 KENG.
>> Councilmember Keng:   THANK 

20:46:26 YOU MAYOR AND THANK YOU VERY 
MUCH FOR -- TO OUR TEAM AND OUR 

20:46:30 CONSULTING FIRM.
I REALLY AM REALLY GLAD THAT WE 

20:46:34 GOT THE FUND TO CONDUCT THIS 
MASTER PLAN STUDY AND SURVEY 

20:46:39 REACHING OUT TO OUR COMMUNITIES 
AND I KNOW THAT IT WAS 

20:46:44 PARTICIPATED REALLY WELL.
I WAS ALSO ABLE TO PARTICIPATE 

20:46:47 IN A COUPLE OF THE COMMUNITY 
MEETINGS.

20:46:50 AND PEOPLE WERE VERY ENGAGING.
SO IT WAS GOOD THAT, YOU KNOW, 

20:46:56 WE HAD OUR OUTREACH AND PEOPLE 
ARE LETTING US KNOW WHAT THEY 

20:47:03 WANT, THEIR INPUT.
SO I DO WANT TO SHARE ONE 

20:47:06 THOUGHT.
WE DID FROM THIS CAN STUDY THAT 

20:47:11 WE DO SEE THIS LACK OF INDOOR 
SPACES FOR -- OF COMMUNITY 

20:47:15 CENTER.
SO FOR MY NEIGHBORHOOD, WE HAVE 

20:47:19 BEEN, YOU KNOW, FOR MANY YEARS 
WITHOUT AN INDOOR COMMUNITY 

20:47:23 CENTER.
AND YOU KNOW WITHOUT THAT, THERE 

20:47:34 IS NO VENUE TO, YOU KNOW, HOLD 
COMMUNITY EVENTS, WELLNESS 

20:47:36 PROGRAMS.
I DO SEE THAT THE NEED WAS 

20:47:39 VERIFIED HERE, IT SAYS NEED 
EXISTS, RIGHT?

20:47:44 AND SO THEN LIKE NORTH OF 
DECOTO, AND THEN ALSO SHOWED 

20:47:51 THAT IT IS ON THE TOP, THE 
NUMBER 1 FOR THE MEDIUM 

20:47:54 PRIORITY.
SO I JUST WANTED TO -- I KNOW 

20:47:57 THAT, YOU KNOW, IT IS HARD FOR 
THE CITY TO ESPECIALLY WHEN WE 

20:48:05 HAVE A NEW CENTER, IT'S HARD, 
YOU KNOW, TO HAVE LIKE THE -- 

20:48:08 ARRANGE NEW MANAGEMENT AND ALL 
THAT STUFF.

20:48:10 BUT I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S ONE 
OF THE REASONS THAT WE ARE 

20:48:16 NOT -- WE HAVEN'T BEEN REALLY, I 
KNOW FUNDING AS WELL BUT THIS 

20:48:20 NEED DOES EXIST AND MANY 
RESIDENTS HAVE BEEN ASKING FOR 

20:48:23 AND MANY I THINK, YOU KNOW, 
COUPLE DECADES BACK YOU KNOW 

20:48:28 THEY WERE KIND OF PROMISED A 
SENIOR CENTER AND IT KIND OF WE 

20:48:32 NEVER GOT THE FUNDING FOR IT.
BUT I JUST WANTED DO ASK IF WE 

20:48:40 HAVE ANY IDEA HOW LIKE WHAT'S 
THE TIME LINE WE'RE LOOKING AT 

20:48:45  
TO GET TO THE SECOND PHASE OF 

20:48:47 THE PRIORITY LIST.
>> THANK YOU COUNCILMEMBER KENG.

20:48:51 IN TERMS OF THE NEXT STEPS HERE 
FOR US AS WE LOOK AT THE VISION 

20:48:55 AND THE RECOMMENDATIONS, 
TYPICALLY IN SYSTEM WIDE MASTER 

20:48:59 PLANS, WE WOULD NOT MAKE A 
SITE-SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATION.

20:49:02 BUT WE WILL IDENTIFY GENERAL 
SIGNIFICANCE AS YOU SAW BY 

20:49:11 AMENITY TYPES.
IF IT'S A CAPITAL INTENSIVE 

20:49:15 PROJECT LIKE A PARK OR A CAN 
FACILITY, OUR RECOMMENDATION 

20:49:22 WOULD BE TO DO A FEASIBILITY 
STUDY, IF THIS MAKES SENSE THEN 

20:49:25 YES, WHAT DOES THE FACE LOOK 
LIKE, WHO CAN YOU PARTNER WITH, 

20:49:29 WHAT MIGHT BE THE CAPITAL COST 
AND THEN BASED ON THE PROGRAMS 

20:49:33 AND THE DESIGN WHAT ARE YOUR 
OPERATINGS AND MAINTENANCE COST, 

20:49:38 STAFFING SO ON AND SO FORTH AS A 
FIVE YEAR PROJECTION.

20:49:41 SO YOU AS COUNCIL ARE GOING IN 
AWARE OF NOT JUST THE COST TO 

20:49:43 BUILD BUT THEN THE COST TO 
OPERATE AND MAINTAIN AS WELL FOR 

20:49:45 THE LONG TERM.
SO THAT IN TERMS OF THE 

20:49:49 PRIORITIES THAT'S HOW WE WOULD 
TYPICALLY CAN GO BY 

20:50:01 RECOMMENDING.
>> Councilmember Keng:   ALL 

20:50:04 RIGHT THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei:   CLARIFYING 

20:50:11 QUESTION, V VICE MAYOR SHAO.
>> Councilmember Shao:   I JUST 

20:50:14 HAVE A CLARIFICATION, WHAT IS 
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PARK 

20:50:18 LAND AND THE GRAZING LAND?
PART OF THE MISSION PEAK AREA 

20:50:23 WOULD BE REGARDED AS PARK LAND 
THEN, SO PER CAPITA FREMONT 

20:50:26 WOULD HAVE MUCH MORE THAN 
REPORTED.

20:50:32 >> DOES ANYONE WANT TO TAKE 
THAT?

20:50:41 >> YES, SO THE PARK LAND PER 
CAPITA IS BASED ON OUR CURRENT 

20:50:48 PARK LAND THIS WE HAVE IN OUR 
DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS TODAY.

20:50:54 AND SO UNDEVELOPED LANDS DO 
NOT -- DO NOT COUNT IN OUR PARK 

20:50:56 LAND STANDARDS.
AND OUR PARTNERS AND THEIR 

20:50:59 PARTNER AGENCIES WE DO NOT COUNT 
THEIR LANDS EITHER AT THIS TIME.

20:51:02 SO THAT WOULD BE A DECISION IF 
WE WERE TO CHANGE THAT POLICY OR 

20:51:06 PRACTICE THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING 
WE WOULD LOOK AT IN THE FUTURE.

20:51:13 
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

20:51:16 ANY OTHER CLARIFYING QUESTIONS 
BEFORE WE TURN TO THE PUBLIC 

20:51:21  PUBLIC?
AT THIS TIME I'LL OPEN THE 

20:51:23 PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD AND I 
BEGIN WITH CHRIS.

20:51:35 WELCOME.
>> I HAVE A QUESTION SIR ABOUT 

20:51:38 HOW YOU'VE GONE ABOUT THIS.
IT SEEMS LIKE WE'RE LOOKING AT 

20:51:42 WHAT PEOPLE WANT TO USE PARKS 
FOR BUT I FEEL THAT WE'VE FAILED 

20:51:45 TO LOOK AT WHAT PEOPLE CURRENTLY 
USE PARKS FOR.

20:51:51 HAVE WE LOOKED AT WHAT PEOPLE 
WANT TO USE PARKS FOR AT 

20:51:54 DIFFERENT HOURS OF THE DAY?
DID YOU VISIT PARKS?

20:51:58 DID YOU COLLECT DATA?
PEOPLE AT PARKS DIFFERENT TIMES 

20:52:02 OF THE DAY?
BECAUSE I TEND TO SEE, 

20:52:09 ESPECIALLY DURING COVID'S PARKS 
SEEM TO BECOME A LOT MORE OF A 

20:52:12 PARKING LOT THAN AN ACTUAL PARK 
TO USE AND I DON'T THINK THAT 

20:52:17 HAS GONE AWAY.
AND SO I'M JUST WONDERING IF YOU 

20:52:20 COLLECTED DATA BY SITTING OUT 
AND LOOKING AT HOW PARKS ARE 

20:52:25 ACTUALLY USED VERSUS THE GOAL 
OOF USING THEM.

20:52:30 SO YOU CAN MEET PEOPLE CLOSE TO 
WHERE THEY'RE AT AND START DOING 

20:52:32 THAT SOONER THAN LATER.
THANK YOU.

20:52:37 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.
NEXT SPEAKER IS LIZ AIMES OF 

20:52:43 BART.
>> GOOD EVENING, MAYOR MEI AND 

20:52:46 COUNCILMEMBERS, I'M YOUR BART 
DIRECTOR, LIZ AIMES.

20:52:51 SO I THINK PARKS AND RECREATION 
ARE SO IMPORTANT TO THE ECONOMIC 

20:52:55 VIABILITY OF ANY CITY.
IT'S OFTEN THOUGHT OF AS AN 

20:53:02 AFTERTHOUGHT O.
SO I THINK THIS IS A GREAT 

20:53:04 OPPORTUNITY FOR FREMONT TO 
INTEGRATE PARKS INTO THE 

20:53:07 ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PLANNING 
RELATED TO BART STATIONS, 

20:53:10 RELATED TO DOWNTOWN, AS I'D 
SPOKEN BEFORE ABOUT THE 

20:53:15 IMPORTANCE OF TRAILS, LINKING 
PARKS TO JOBS OR PARKS TO 

20:53:22 DOWNTOWN.
I THINK RATHER THAN FOCUSING ON 

20:53:24 POTENTIALLY THESE INDOOR 
FACILITIES WHICH OBVIOUSLY LOOK 

20:53:31 IMPORTANT TO THE COMMUNITY, THE 
TOP-RATED NEEDS ARE REALLY 

20:53:37 HISTORICAL AND PARK PROGRAMS, 
OPEN SPACE AND CONSERVATION.

20:53:43 AND I WOULD POINT TO A PARK OVER 
BY ISHERWOOD JUDICIARY, THE 

20:53:48 PETERSON FARMHOUSE ON RAMIREZ 
FARM IN UNION CITY, BORDERS 

20:53:55 FREMONT AND IT'S A HISTORICAL 
AREA, BECAUSE THE ORIGINAL 

20:53:56 ALAMEDA CREEK PASSES THROUGH 
THERE.

20:54:05 AND THE SAN FRANCISCO ESTUARY  
INSTITUTE SAID THAT COULD BE AN 

20:54:09 AREA TO ESTABLISH THE STEEL HEAD 
TROUT SO IT COULD BE HABITAT FOR 

20:54:12 THAT AREA.
SO HOPEFULLY WE COULD CONSIDER 

20:54:15 CONSERVATION A TOP PRIORITY AS 
WELL GIVEN CLIMATE CHANGE.

20:54:17 THANK YOU SO MUCH.
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

20:54:26 NEXT SPEAKER IS SARESH.
>> HI, SO I HEARD SUZANNE WOLF 

20:54:29 MADE THE COMMENT THAT MISSION 
PEAK LAND IS CONSIDERED GRAZING 

20:54:36 LAND AND NOT PARK LAND.
AND I WOULD LIKE TO UNDERSTAND, 

20:54:41 WHEN DID THE CITY COUNCIL, I'M 
ASSUMING IT'S SOME PRIOR CITY 

20:54:47 COUNCIL, MADE THIS DECISION.
WHO IS IT DECLARED THE FREMONT 

20:54:54 CITY-OWNED MISSION PEAK LAND TO 
BE NOT PARK LAND, SEEMS RATHER 

20:55:03 WEIRD DISTINCTION.
THE OTHER QUESTION I HAVE IS 

20:55:10 MR. BHATT SAIDINGING LAKE 
ELIZABETH IS CONSIDERED 

20:55:14 WATERFRONT PARK ALL ITS 
AMENITIES, WOULD THE EAST BAY 

20:55:20 PARK AND THERE ARE SEVERAL M OF 
THEM AROUND FREMONT ARE THEY 

20:55:23 ALSO CONSIDERED DESTINATION PARK 
OR ARE THEY NOT PART OF THE 

20:55:26 STUDY BECAUSE THEY DO NOT BELONG 
TO CITY OF FREMONT?

20:55:29 AND IF THEY ARE CONSIDERED 
DESTINATION PARK OR THEY SHOULD 

20:55:32 BE, SHOULDN'T THEY ALSO HAVE 
PROVIDED THE PARKING AND 

20:55:37 RESTROOM FACILITIES SIMILAR TO 
WHAT IS AVAILABLE FOR LAKE 

20:55:38 ELIZABETH VISITORS?
THANK YOU.

20:55:46 >> Mayor Mei:   MR. ARUGI, 
WELCOME, WILLIAM.

20:56:00 >> THANK YOU, WILLIAM UREGI, 
MISSION PEAK CONSERVANCY.

20:56:05 ACCESS TO PARKS AND THE CREATION 
OF MULTIUSE TRAILS IS A FOCUS OF 

20:56:09 OURS.
THE ONLY CONCERN AND THIS IS A 

20:56:16 SMALL ONE IS WHEN YOU LOOK AT 
THE SANTA CLARITA, THEY HAVE 

20:56:19 DLEAN,000 ACRES THEY MANAGE IN 
THEIR PARKS AND RECREATION 

20:56:23 DEPARTMENT, WE HAVE FAR LESS.
THEY ARE VERY SIMILAR IN TERMS 

20:56:36 OF CITY SIZE EVEN THOUGH SANTA 
CLAIRETA HAS MORE UNDER THE 

20:56:39 PARKS AND RECREATION DEPARTMENT 
FOR CONSIDERATION FOR 

20:56:42 RECREATIONAL ACCESS INCLUDING 
THE 72nd HILLS OF MISSION 

20:56:49  FOOTHILLS OF MISSION PEAK.
FUTURE OPEN SPACE SO AGAIN WE 

20:56:52 SUPPORT THE PLAN.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

20:56:59  .
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU, NEXT 

20:57:07 IS STEVE SCALA.
>> YES, THANK YOU.

20:57:11 SO MR. BHATT, LAST WEEK FOR THE 
RECREATION COMMISSION I HEARD 

20:57:15 YOU MAKE COMMENTS IS THAT TRENDS 
IN RECREATION IS THAT WHEN 

20:57:18 PEOPLE GO DO RECREATION CENTERS 
HOW THEY GET THERE IS GOING TO 

20:57:21 BE INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT AND IN 
PARTICULAR PEOPLE WANT TO 

20:57:27 BICYCLE TO THEIR RECREATION 
ACTIVITIES AT THE PRIMARY 

20:57:30 CENTERS AND DESTINATIONS.
SO IF THAT'S TRUE I THINK IT IS 

20:57:36 IMPORTANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT WE 
HAVE ROBUST BICYCLE PROGRAM IN 

20:57:42 FREMONT, BUT STILL, IT WOULD BE 
I BELIEVE CRITICAL TO REVIEW THE 

20:57:47 BICYCLING ABILITY TO GET TO THE 
PRIMARY RECREATION CENTERS IN 

20:57:49 FREMONT.
SO AGAIN, IF THAT'S TRUE, I 

20:57:51 THINK IT WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO 
EMPHASIZE.

20:57:56 THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

20:58:04 NEXT IS KELLY.
>> COUPLE OF REACTIONS TO THIS 

20:58:07 REPORT.
ONE WOULD BE THE SELECTION OF 

20:58:12 THE PEER GROUP CITIES.
IT SEEMS THAT THE PEER GROUP 

20:58:21 CITIES SHOULD BE SELECTED NOT 
JUST ON THE BEHAVES BUT ECONOMIC 

20:58:26 CAPABILITIES, I'D COMPARE 
FREMONT TO SUNNYVALE OR 

20:58:29 LIVERMORE OR PLEASANTON.
SOME OF THESE PLACES ON THAT 

20:58:32 LIST I NEVER HEARD OF, I DON'T 
KNOW WHERE THEY ARE.

20:58:34 THAT MAP WAS EXTREMELY 
INTERESTING.

20:58:37 THE MAP THAT SHOWED THESE LITTLE 
GAPS.

20:58:40 THOSE GAPS WERE IN IRVINGTON.
I AGREE WITH THAT.

20:58:43 THERE'S A GAP THERE.
AND THEN THERE WAS ALSO KIND OF 

20:58:47 TOUR NORTH OOF DOWNTOWN TOWARDS 
CENTERVILLE, A LITTLE GAP.

20:58:51 IT'S LITTLE BUT THERE'S A LOT OF 
PEOPLE THERE AND THAT'S A GAP.

20:58:56 THIS CITY IS UNABLE TO TAKE THE 
ASSETS AND MANAGE THEM, MANAGE 

20:59:01 THE ASSETS IT HAS.
IT HAS A MORRISON CANYON ROAD 

20:59:09 WHICH IS REALLY A TRAIL.
IT IS A PAVED MULTIUSE TRAIL, IT 

20:59:13 IS NOT NAMED A TRAIL, IT IS 
NAMED A ROAD.

20:59:15 IT NEEDS TO BE RENAMED 
IMMEDIATELY.

20:59:20 THE MISSION PEAK IS -- THE 
CITY'S FOCUS ON ACREAGE NEEDS TO 

20:59:23 BE REFOCUSED ON PEOPLE.
IF YOU HAVE A SITE THAT DRAWS A 

20:59:26 LOT OF PEOPLE FOR A LOT OF TIME 
FOR A STRENUOUS ACTIVITY THAT 

20:59:29 SHOULD BE GIVEN EXTRA CREDIT AND 
YOU SHOULD BE TRACKING WHAT THE 

20:59:32 PEOPLE, WHERE THE PEOPLE ARE AND 
WHAT THEY'RE DOING.

20:59:34 MAYBE CELL PHONE DATA WOULD 
HELP.

20:59:41 BUT THIS IS -- THE CITY NEEDS TO 
GET AWAY FROM THESE ARBITRARY 

20:59:44 METRICS.
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

20:59:50 NEXT SPEAKER IS PAULO.
>> HI, CAN YOU HEAR ME?

20:59:53 >> Mayor Mei:   YES, PLEASE.
>> HELLO CAN YOU HEAR ME?

21:00:00 >> Mayor Mei:   YES.
>> MY NAME IS BALA, I LIVE IN 

21:00:04 FREMONT OOP.
IN THE COVID YEARS A LOT OF DOG 

21:00:08 OWNERS ARE FINDING IT DIFFICULT 
TO EXERCISE THEIR DOGS BECAUSE 

21:00:12 MOST OF THE COMMUNITY PARKS HAVE 
DOGS ON LEASH RULES.

21:00:14 I WOULD REALLY RECOMMEND THAT 
EVERY COMMUNITY PARK IN THE CITY 

21:00:20 OF FREMONT HAS A DESIGNATED DOG 
RUN.

21:00:25 HOPEFULLY THAT IS A PARK OF 
DOMESTIC LANDS.

21:00:26 THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

21:00:29 AND THAT WAS THE LAST SPEAKER 
AND I'M GOING TO CLOSE THE 

21:00:31 PUBLIC COMMENT NOW AND BRING IT 
BACK TO THE COUNCIL FOR A 

21:00:39 DISCUSSION.
COUNCILMEMBER JONES.

21:00:52 COUNCILMEMBER JONES I'M SORRY 
YOU'RE ON MUTE.

21:00:54 THANK YOU.
>> Councilmember Jones:   NOT 

21:01:00 ACCORDING TO MY SCREEN BUT CAN 
YOU HEAR ME NOW?

21:01:03 >> Mayor Mei:   MY APOLOGIES.
I'M STILL HAVING DIFFICULTY 

21:01:16 HEARING YOU.
>> NO.

21:01:20 >> Councilmember Jones:   NO?
>> Mayor Mei:   NOW WE CAN, WE 

21:01:21 CAN HEAR YOU.
>> Councilmember Jones:   IF I 

21:01:24 TAKE IT OUT IT STILL WANTS ME TO 
TALK TO IT.

21:01:28 AS I WAS SAYING MY SINCERE 
THANKS TO SUZANNE AND HER STAFF 

21:01:32 AND TO OUR CONSULTANT.
I LIKE COUNCILMEMBER KENG I'VE 

21:01:34 ATTENDED A COUPLE OF THESE 
COMMUNITY MEETINGS AND YOU GUYS 

21:01:38 HAVE DONE A PHENOMENAL JOB FOR 
BRINGING US UP TO SPEED.

21:01:41 I WOULD LOVE TO SKI A LOT OF 
THESE THINGS IMPLEMENTED.

21:01:45 MY ONLY QUESTION, CONCERN I 
GUESS, IS WHERE ARE WE GOING TO 

21:01:49 GET THE MONEY FOR THIS?
IT WOULD BE NICE IF WE HAD 

21:01:51 TRUCKLOADS OF MONEY.
I JUST DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH WE'RE 

21:01:54 GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO GOING 
FORWARD.

21:01:58 BUT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE A LOT OF 
THIS STUFF IMPLEMENTED AS WE DO 

21:02:00 MOVE FORWARD TO BENEFIT OUR 
RESIDENTS SO THANK YOU.

21:02:07 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.
COUNCILMEMBER KENG.

21:02:09 >> Councilmember Keng:   YES, 
THANK YOU MAYOR SO AGAIN YEAH 

21:02:14 APPRECIATE ALL THE WORK THAT HAS 
BEEN PUT INTO IT AND THE 

21:02:16 OUTREACH TO THE COMMUNITY.
ESPECIALLY, YOU KNOW, DURING 

21:02:22 THIS COVID PANDEMIC TIME WE SEE 
HOW IMPORTANT IT IS FOR US TO 

21:02:26 GET OUT AND EXERCISE AND IT'S 
GOOD FOR OUR MENTAL HEALTH, YOU 

21:02:29 KNOW, AS PEOPLE ARE COOPED 
INSIDE FOR TOO LONG THEY DEVELOP 

21:02:35 YOU KNOW ANXIETY AND PHYSICALLY 
BECOMING NOT AS FIT.

21:02:40 SO IT IS IMPORTANT FOR US, 
ESPECIALLY IN THIS DAY AND AGE 

21:02:46 FOR THE SILICON VALLEY SO FAST 
PACED AND PEOPLE NEED TO GET 

21:02:50 THEIR TIME OUT EXERCISING AND SO 
I DO REALLY SEE THAT YOU KNOW, 

21:02:54 HAVING NOW HAVING DONE THIS 
STUDY, WE KNOW WHAT AWAY -- 

21:02:57 WHERE WE'RE LACKING YOU KNOW 
BECAUSE WHEN YOU ARE KIND OF 

21:03:01 INSIDE, YOU KNOW, IT'S HARD TO 
SEE WHAT'S MISSING AND THEN WHEN 

21:03:06 YOU HAVE A THIRD PARTY 
CONSULTANT KIND OF BRINGING UP 

21:03:10 DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE NOW WE SEE 
OH WE NEED PICKLE BALL WE NEED 

21:03:13 PARK WHERE THERE IS NO 
NEIGHBORHOOD PARK THAT'S WITHIN 

21:03:17 TEN MINUTE REACH OR 15 MINUTE 
REACH.

21:03:21 AND SO YOU KNOW WE NEED MORE DOG 
PARKS.

21:03:27 THINGS THAT PEOPLE FIND MORE 
USEFUL, SO I -- YEAH SO I THINK 

21:03:32 NOW THAT WE KNOW WHAT'S LACKING 
AND, YOU KNOW, THE BATHROOMS ARE 

21:03:36 PRETTY HIGH ON THAT LIST THAT 
WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT FOR A 

21:03:38 LONG TIME AND IT IS REALLY A 
NEED.

21:03:42 SO YOU KNOW WE NEED TO MAKE OUR 
NEIGHBORHOOD PARKS MORE USER 

21:03:47 FRIENDLY, THEN WE'LL HAVE MORE 
PEOPLE TO USE THEM AND THEN YEAH 

21:03:55 SO DEFINITELY IT'S A VERY GOOD 
STUDY AND IT WILL HELP US SEE 

21:03:59 WHERE WE'RE LACKING AND THEN WE 
CAN MAKE AIT THE BEST BENEFICIAL 

21:04:01 FOR OUR RESIDENTS.
THANK YOU.

21:04:12 >> Mayor Mei:   ANY OTHER 
COMMENTS FROM THE COUNCIL OR 

21:04:15 ELSE I'LL MAKE AMINE AND WE CAN 
MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS.

21:04:18 AND WE HAVE ANOTHER -- THIS IS 
JUST ACCEPTING THE STAFF REPORT 

21:04:22 AT THIS TIME.
I'LL MAKE SOME OF THE COMMENTS.

21:04:25 I THINK THAT CERTAINLY, WE HAVE 
BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS FOR A 

21:04:29 LONG TIME.
AND IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT IT'S 

21:04:35 BEEN 25 YEARS SINCE WE'VE 
UPDATED OUR MASTER PARK PLAN SO 

21:04:38 THIS IS AN ENORMOUS UNDERTAKING 
SO I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT 

21:04:41 TO HIGHLIGHT THAT WE DID DAY ON 
THIS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE 

21:04:45 PANDEMIC WHICH IS A LITTLE 
UNUSUAL BUT I ALSO WANT TO THANK 

21:04:50 PUBLIC FOR COMING OUT.
I DID ATTEND MULTIPLE BOTH THE 

21:04:53 ZOOM MEETINGS AS WELL AS THE 
KICKOFF IN PERSON AND SOME OF 

21:04:55 THE DISCUSSIONS THIS SUMMER.
I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE PUBLIC 

21:04:59 THIS SUMMER WHEN WE HAD THE 
ACTIVE FREMONT UNITS THAT IT WAS 

21:05:07 A GOOD WAY FOR US TO HEAR FROM,  
SOME OF THE PEOPLE DIRECTLY, AS 

21:05:09 WE TOURED DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE 
CITY AND I APPRECIATE DID 

21:05:12 COUNCIL FOR TAKING ON THOSE 
OPPORTUNITIES TO MEET WITH SOME 

21:05:16 OF OUR CONSTITUENTS AND TO SEE.
WE ARE VERY BLESSED FOR THOSE 

21:05:21 WHO DON'T KNOW, BESIDES THE 
CITY'S PARK, WE ARE FORTUNATE TO 

21:05:28 BE HOME TO BOTH DON EDWARDS 
WILDLIFE REFUGE AND ALSO TO EAST 

21:05:31 BAY REGIONAL PARKS.
WE JUST OPENED THE FIRST 

21:05:34 CAMPGROUND IN THE BAY AREA JUST 
ABOUT A WEEK AND A HALF AGO.

21:05:37 AND THAT IS I THINK IT'S THE 
SIXTH IF YOU COUNT THE TRAILS 

21:05:40 ALSO, SEVENTH PARK FOR EAST BAY 
REGIONAL PARK.

21:05:46 WE HAVE MORE EAST BAY REGIONAL 
PARKS THAN ANY OTHER CITY IN 

21:05:48 THIS -- IN THE WHOLE DISTRICT, 
PARK DISTRICT.

21:05:52 AND THAT HAS BEEN A REAL 
VALUABLE ASSET TO US.

21:05:55 CERTAINLY I'M HEARING A LOT OF 
FEEDBACK, I MEAN EVERYTHING FROM 

21:05:58 PICKLE BALL AND FOR PEOPLE WHO 
DON'T THINK I READ EVERYTHING I 

21:06:04 DID SEE THAT SOMEBODY ASKED 
ABOUT DISK-GOLF, AND I'VE SEEN 

21:06:08 EVERYTHING SERGE CRICKET HAS 
BEEN A COMMENT OVER THE YEARS, 

21:06:10 SWIMMING BECAUSE THERE WAS NO 
COMMUNITY POOL AND ORIGINALLY 

21:06:13 THERE WAS A JOINT EFFORT WITH 
THAT MANY YEARS AGO.

21:06:16 I ALSO HEAR A LOT OF THE 
INTEREST OF HAVING INDOOR SPACE 

21:06:21 AND IN FACT TOMORROW WE WILL BE 
OPENING UP AN AGE WELL CENTER IN 

21:06:23 SOUTHERN FREMONT.
I THINK THAT CERTAINLY JUST TO 

21:06:27 ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE HAS BEEN 
TREMENDOUS NEED THROUGHOUT THE 

21:06:29 CITY MOST OF THE QUESTIONS THAT 
COUNCILMEMBER JONES RAISED IS 

21:06:32 HOW DO WE FINANCE IT?
HOW DO WE GET THE SUPPORT LIND 

21:06:34 IT?
AND I'VE SEEN THIS GROWTH FROM 

21:06:37 THE CITY SIDE AND IN THE PAST 
FROM THE SCHOOL DISTRICT SIDE.

21:06:40 HOW MANY TIMES I'VE HAD 
CONVERSATIONS WHERE PEOPLE ABOUT 

21:06:43 HAVING RECREATION, AND SOME 
PEOPLE SAY I'D RATHER HAVE THE 

21:06:45 CURRICULUM VERSUS THE 
RECREATION.

21:06:49 AND WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT 
PLACEMENT AND TRYING TO GET 

21:06:52 ANYTHING PASSED IN TERMS OF A 
BOND OR OTHER MEASURES, IF YOU 

21:06:58 LOOK AT SANTA CLARITA THEY 
PASSED A SIGNIFICANT BOND THAT 

21:07:00 SAID WE WANT TO MAKE THIS 
INVESTMENT A TREMENDOUS 

21:07:02 PRIORITY.
BUT OFTENTIMES IN THE PAST WHEN 

21:07:06 WE'VE HAD THESE CONVERSATIONS IN 
PEOPLE WANT TO HAVE THESE -- IF 

21:07:11 PEOPLE WANT TO HAVE NIECE 
FACILITIES IT DOES TAKE MONEY.

21:07:14 THAT NEEDS TO COME FROM THE 
COMMUNITY, RAISING UP A SPECIAL 

21:07:16 LAND USE DISTRICT IN ONE OF THE 
AREAS TO SAY THAT THEY'RE GOING 

21:07:20 TO BE PAYING FOR THAT AND I KNOW 
I THINK COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN AND 

21:07:23 I HAD TO RECUSE OURSELVES 
BECAUSE WE WERE PART OF THAT 

21:07:25 DISTRICT.
IT IS SOMETHING THAT THE 

21:07:27 COMMUNITY IS INVESTING IN SAYING 
WE WANT TO DO THIS.

21:07:30 SO WITH THE ONE THAT WE'RE 
OPENING I'M VERY GRATEFUL AND I 

21:07:34 KNOW THAT ORIGINALLY SOME OF THE 
PLANS WERE IN NORTH FREMONT AND 

21:07:36 OTHER PLACES BUT BECAUSE THE 
DEVELOPER AT THAT TIME AND WE 

21:07:40 TALK ABOUT THE NEED FOR 
COMMUNITY BENEFITS, THEY DID 

21:07:44 STEP UP IN THAT MOMENT TO HELP 
FUND THAT SPECIFICALLY AS PART 

21:07:47 OF A COMMUNITY THAT WAS BEING 
BUILD, A PLANNED COMMUNITY.

21:07:50 AND THAT'S WHY IT'S AN AGE WELL 
CENTER BECAUSE IT IS PART OF A 

21:07:53 SENIOR COMMUNITY.
AND AS WE WANTED TO CREATE THAT 

21:08:00 HEALTH AND WELLNESS PIECE OF IT, 
NOT ONLY DID THEY HELP US WITH 

21:08:02 BUILDING IT BUT ALSO WITH 
MAINTENANCE OF IT.

21:08:05 WE WOULD LOVE TO HAVE PEOPLE 
COME UP AND STEP UP ON THESE 

21:08:10 KINDS OF EFFORTS BUT IT DOES DAY 
THAT KIND OF COMBINATION OF WILL 

21:08:13 AND ALSO OF COMMUNITY SUPPORT.
WE'RE HOPING THAT WHEN WE TALK 

21:08:18 TO SOME OF OUR OTHER BUSINESSES 
HERE AND WE HAVE HAD THESE 

21:08:22 COMMERCIAL LINKAGE FEES AND 
OTHER THINGS THAT THERE MIGHT BE 

21:08:24 OPPORTUNITIES AS WE LOOK AT 
TRAILS AND OTHER THINGS MOVING 

21:08:26 FORWARD.
SO I'M VERY SUPPORTIVE OF 

21:08:28 ACCEPTING THIS REPORT.
I LOOK FORWARD TO THE MAPPING.

21:08:32 I AM PROUD TO SAY THAT AS THE 
MAYOR, WHEN I HEARD ABOUT THE 

21:08:35 TEN MINUTE WALK I WAS ONE OF THE 
FIRST TO STEP UP.

21:08:37 BECAUSE I WANT TO THINK ABOUT 
LEAVING A LEGACY.

21:08:42 AND I GREW UP NEXT TO A WILDLIFE 
RESERVE, PRESERVE THAT'S STILL 

21:08:45 THERE TODAY.
MANY, MANY, MANY YEARS LATER.

21:08:48 AND WILL HOPEFULLY BE THERE FOR 
GENERATIONS TO COME.

21:08:53 AND SO IT REQUIRES THAT TYPE OF 
DETERMINATION AND I HOPE THE 

21:08:56 PUBLIC STEPS UP AND I HAVE TO 
THANK AGAIN ALL THE 

21:08:58 COUNCILMEMBERS, THE STAFF AND 
THE COMMUNITY MEMBERS WHO 

21:09:01 BELIEVE IN THIS AND HOPEFULLY 
EVEN FOR ALL OF OUR SPEAKERS 

21:09:05 TONIGHT I KNOW THERE WERE PEOPLE 
FROM DISHT AGENCIES, WHETHER 

21:09:11 IT'S COMMUNITY BASED 
ORGANIZATIONS LIKE MISSION PEAK 

21:09:15 CONSERVANCY OR BART OR OTHERS, 
IT REQUIRES THAT COMMUNITY 

21:09:20 OUTREACH AND UNDERSTANDING, I'M 
HOPING LATER THIS YEAR WHEN BART 

21:09:26 ACCEPTS OUR BART BIKE-PED BRIDGE 
THAT WILL ALLOW US TO HAVE THAT 

21:09:28 DPAFLT.
I THINK ONE OF THE OTHER 

21:09:32 SPEAKERS TALKED ABOUT EARLIER 
TALKED ABOUT HOW IMPORTANT IT IS 

21:09:37 TO HAVE ACCESS TO THESE AND WHAT 
ARE SOME OF THE METHODOLOGIES TO 

21:09:39 GET THERE.
WE WILL BE TALKING ABOUT TRAILS 

21:09:42 AND I'M SURE BIKE PATHS AND 
OTHER THINGS ARE SOME OF THE 

21:09:47 NEEDS HOW WE CAN GET THERE BEING 
SAFE AND ALSO BEING EFFECTIVE.

21:09:49 ONE OF MY COUNCILMEMBERS ALSO 
REFERRED TO THE DISCUSSION ABOUT 

21:09:53 GETTING CONNECTIONS TO TRAILS 
AND ACCESS IN SAFE MANNERS AND 

21:09:56 THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE 
REALLY NEED TO TAKE ON.

21:09:59 I'VE BEEN LOOKING AT SOME OF THE 
THINGS AND THIS YEAR HAS BEEN A 

21:10:04 LITTLE BIT STRESSFUL IN GETTING 
SO MANY GETTING COVID-COOPED, 

21:10:13 BUT I ALSO ENCOURAGE TO WORK 
WITH US WHETHER IT BE BIKE CLUBS 

21:10:17 OR BIKE STORES, PARENTING PIECES 
ARE REALLY IMPORTANT SO WE CAN 

21:10:21 PARTNER WITH PTAS AND SAFE 
ROUTES TO SCHOOLS, ALONG SOME OF 

21:10:28 THE THINGS WE'RE LOOKING AT IS 
THE QUIET ZONES IN CROSSINGS.

21:10:31 THOSE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS AS 
YOU SEE IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF 

21:10:35 MONTHS AS WE ARE SLOWLY MAKING 
SOME CHANGES YOU MAY HAVE SEEN 

21:10:39 IN HAYWARD OR MISSION BOULEVARD 
THERE HAVE BEEN CHANGES ON 

21:10:43 ACCESS AND EASEMENTS TO CREATE 
SOME MORE NATURAL DROUGHT 

21:10:48 RESISTANT PLANTS AND BIKE 
TRAILS, JUST TO LET YOU KNOW 

21:10:58 THAT STRETCHES FROM SAN LEANDRO 
TO HAYWARD TO FREMONT.

21:11:02 FOR THAT MORE BEAUTY IN TERMS OF 
THE MAYOR NATURE OF BEING PART 

21:11:04 OF THE ROADWAY AND FOR COMMUNITY 
ACCESS.

21:11:06 I THINK THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO 
SAY.

21:11:08 I'M SUPPORTIVE OF ACCEPTING THIS 
REPORT.

21:11:11 THERE IS NO VOTE I THINK IS IT 
REQUIRED THIS EVENING?

21:11:14 SUZANNE I THINK JUST ACCEPTING 
THE REPORT.

21:11:17 SO I SEE COUNCILMEMBER KENG ALSO 
YOU HAVE A COMMENT NOW.

21:11:20 >> Councilmember Keng:   YES, 
THANK YOU MAYOR.

21:11:26 YEAH, I JUST HAVE ANOTHER QUICK 
QUESTION I FORGOT OTO MENTION 

21:11:28 EARLIER.
ON THE PROGRAMS THAT THE CITY IS 

21:11:33 OFFERING I WANTED TO KIND OF 
MAKE AN INPUT ABOUT FOR EXAMPLE, 

21:11:36 YOU KNOW, LIKE OVER THE SUMMERS 
WE HAVE THE THURSDAY NIGHT 

21:11:40 CONCERTS AT THE PARK, RIGHT?
AND I THINK IN FREMONT LIKE WE 

21:11:43 HAVE, YOU KNOW, DOZENS OF 
LANGUAGES BEING SPOKEN IN OUR 

21:11:47 COMMUNITY.
WE HAVE, YOU KNOW, MORE OF OUR 

21:11:51 RESIDENTS, MORE THAN 50% OF OUR 
RESIDENTS THAT WERE NOT BORN IN 

21:11:59 THIS COUNTRY AND WE HAVE, YOU 
KNOW, VERY CULTURALLY RICH AND 

21:12:01 DIVERSE.
I WANT TO ENCOURAGE IF WE KIND 

21:12:07 OF LOOK INTO HAVING MORE LIKE WE 
COULD HAVE SONGS OR BAND IN 

21:12:10 DIFFERENT LANGUAGES, KIND OF 
LIKE MIX AND MATCH AND STUFF AND 

21:12:14 I THINK THAT WOULD REALLY YOU 
KNOW ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO GET TO 

21:12:17 KNOW OTHER CULTURE.
I THINK LIKE OTHER CITIES, I 

21:12:21 KNOW THAT YOU KNOW THEY HOST, 
OTHER CITIES SMALLER THAN 

21:12:27 FREMONT, THEY HOST LIKE ETHNIC 
HOLIDAYS LIKE LUNAR NEW YEAR OR 

21:12:33 MOON FESTIVAL OR YOU KNOW 
LIKEDWALI, LIKE FROM THE CITY, 

21:12:36 LIKE I KNOW WE HAVE PROGRAMS 
LIKE IN THE COMMUNITY BUT WHEN 

21:12:42 WITS HOSTED IN THE CITY IT KIND 
OF BRINGS ON A DIFFERENT 

21:12:45 MEANING, EMBRACING, INVITING 
EVERYONE TO COME TO ONE POINT 

21:12:48 AND CELEBRATING TOGETHER.
I THINK A LOT OF TIMES WE FEEL 

21:12:52 LIKE OH WE DON'T WANT TO LIKE 
JUST CELEBRATE THIS CULTURE AND 

21:12:58 NOT CELEBRATE YOU KNOW MISSED 
OUT ON MAYBE WE'LL MISS ONE HERE 

21:13:02 OR THERE, AND WE END UP DOING 
NOTHING.

21:13:07 WE DON'T CELEBRATE ANY CULTURAL 
EVENTS AT ALL, I WOULD SAY.

21:13:11 SO I THINK WE -- GOING FORWARD I 
WOULD ENCOURAGE, YOU KNOW, I 

21:13:14 THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO KIND OF 
TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION IF WE 

21:13:19 MIGHT BE ABLE TO KIND OF HOST OR 
YOU KNOW ADDING SOME ELEMENTS 

21:13:22 WITHIN THAT -- THOSE THURSDAY, 
YOU KNOW SOME OF THE EVENTS THAT 

21:13:26 THE CITY DOES HOST AND IT'S 
ALREADY WE'RE ALREADY DOING IT 

21:13:30 SO IF WE ADDED IN THERE THEN 
IT'S NOT LIKE TOO MUCH 

21:13:32 ADDITIONAL EXPENSES.
YEAH, THANK YOU.

21:13:35 >> Mayor Mei:   WELL, THANK YOU 
SO MUCH COUNCILMEMBER KENG.

21:13:40 I'M GOING TO NET NE RVETIONLY 
CLOSE.

21:13:43 I WOULD ENCOURAGE ANYONE ELSE 
WATCHING IF THERE ARE SPONSORS, 

21:13:48 I KNOW IF THERE ARE OTHER EVENTS 
IN CUPERTINO OR OTHER CITIES 

21:13:52 THEY HAVE CORPORATE SPONSORS OR 
GENEROUS DONORS.

21:13:58 WE HAVE CELEBRATION INDIA.
WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE OTHER 

21:14:00 COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS 
STEP UP.

21:14:04 NE RVETIONLAY WHY DON'T WE 
FINISH UP.

21:14:08 >> MAYOR JUST ONE PIECE AND 
RESPOND AS WELL.

21:14:10 ALONG WITH THE CULTURAL 
DIVERSITY HOW INTENTIONAL YOU AS 

21:14:18 A CITY ARE ABOUT INCLUSION OF 
SUZANNE AND KIM SENT ME A VIDEO 

21:14:21 FROM ONE OF YOUR CONCERTS IN THE 
PARK AND THIS IS THE FIRST TIME 

21:14:26 I HAVE SEEN A PARK OR 
RECREATIONAL SERVICES TEAM HAVE 

21:14:32 A CONCERT WITH AN ASL TRANSLATOR 
INTERPRETER THERE.

21:14:35 I'M SPEAKING OF THE NATIONAL 
CONFERENCE ON TRENDS AND BEST 

21:14:41 PRACTICES AND FREMONT IS IN THAT 
NATIONAL PRESENTATION FOR YOUR 

21:14:44 INTENTIONALITY AND INCLUSION.
SOMETIMES WHEN YOU ARE IN IT IT 

21:14:48 IS HARD TO STEP OVER AND REALIZE 
HOW COOL SOME OF THE THINGS ARE 

21:14:51 THAT YOU DO.
BUT I SEE THE ENTIRE COUNTRY AND 

21:14:54 THERE IS NOBODY THAT DOES SOME 
OF THE THINGS THAT YOU DO WHEN 

21:14:58 IT COMES TO TRULY MAKING IT A 
WELCOMING INCLUSIVE EXPERIENCE.

21:15:03 SO I WANT TO GIVE A SHOUT OUR TO 
ALL OF YOU AND THE STAFF 

21:15:05 ESPECIALLY.
I THINK THAT'S ABSOLUTELY 

21:15:07 PHENOMENAL.
SO IN THAT SPIRIT AS WELL AND 

21:15:11 YES EXACTLY SUZANNE, IN THAT 
SPIRIT WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO 

21:15:15 WORKING WITH THE STAFF.
SUZANNE'S FOCUS HAS BEEN VERY 

21:15:19 CLEAR FRET BEGINNING.
WE WANT TO DO THIS RIGHT AND NOT 

21:15:22 FAST.
I KNOW MAYOR MEI YOU AND THE 

21:15:25 COUNCILMEMBERS HAVE BEEN VERY 
SUPPORTIVE WITH ALL THE TIME YOU 

21:15:28 HAVE TAKEN.
WE'LL COME BACK TO YOU AND THE 

21:15:32 COMMUNITY AS WE MOVE THIS CLOSER 
TO THE DRAFT AND THEN THE FINAL 

21:15:36 PLAN AND IN THE MEANWHILE IF ANY 
OF YOU HAVE ANY OTHER INPUT YOU 

21:15:40 KNOW HOW TO REACH SUZANNE YOU 
KNOW HOW TO REACH ME.

21:15:42 THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH.
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

21:15:45 WE AREN'T GOING TO LEAVE THIS 
TOPIC QUITE YET.

21:15:52 WE ARE NOW PROCEEDING WITH THE 
TRAIL STRATEGY PLAN SO WE ARE 

21:15:54 CONTINUING WITH THE GREATLY 
OUTDOORS.

21:15:57 WE ARE GOING TO APPROVE THERE 
PLAN AND IT PROVIDES A 30 YEARS 

21:16:04 VISION, CITY WIDE TRAILS 
PROJECTS AND APPROVE THE 

21:16:06 TRANSFER OF FUNDS FOR THIS 
PROPOSAL.

21:16:12 AND I BELIEVE HANS YOU QUILL BE 
SHARING THAT ALONG WITH RENEE 

21:16:15 WHO IS THE ASSOCIATE 
TRANSPORTATION ENGINEER ON THIS 

21:16:20 THIS EVENING.
>> Hans Larsen:   THANK YOU, 

21:16:24 MAYOR MEI, WE HAVE A VERY BRIEF 
VERBAL REPORT FOR YOU.

21:16:29 THIS IS VERY MUCH RELATED TO THE 
PARKS AND RECREATION MASTER 

21:16:32 PLAN, TAKING A DEEPER DIVE IN 
LOOKING AT OUR TRAILS PROGRAM 

21:16:35 AND I THINK THIS IS THE FIRST 
TIME IN FREMONT'S HISTORY THAT 

21:16:44 WE HAVE ACTUALLY PREPARED AND 
HOPEFULLY TONIGHT YOU'LL ADOPT 

21:16:47 IS A SPECIFIC PLAN RELATED TO 
OUR TRAILS PROGRAM.

21:16:50 IT WAS ABOUT 20 MONTHS AGO THAT 
WE STARTED THIS EFFORT.

21:16:53 THERE'S BEEN AN INCREDIBLE 
AMOUNT OF INPUT FROM THE 

21:16:56 COMMUNITY.
SOME OF THE IT COMING THROUGH 

21:17:01 THE PARK AND REC PLANNING 
PROCESS AND THEN SOME SEPARATE 

21:17:04 WORK THAT WE'VE DONE THAT'S BEEN 
FOCUSING ON DRAILS.

21:17:10  ON TRAILS.
WE COME TO YOU TONIGHT FOLLOWING 

21:17:13 A JOINT MEETING OF THE 
RECREATION COMMISSION AND THE 

21:17:17 MOBILITY COMMISSION AND THEY 
SPENT PROBABLY TWO HOURS HEARING 

21:17:21 A MORE DETAILED PRESENTATION AND 
DISCUSSING THE TRAIL STRATEGY 

21:17:25 AND I'M VERY PLEASED TO REPORT 
THAT EACH OF THE COMMISSIONS IS 

21:17:28 RECOMMENDING APPROVAL OF THIS 
PLAN.

21:17:31 EACH OF THEM TOOK A UNANIMOUS 
VOTE OF SUPPORT.

21:17:36 SO A LOT OF WORK.
HOPEFULLY A REALLY GREAT PRODUCT 

21:17:39 FOR OUR COMMUNITY.
SO WHAT THIS IS IS, IS REALLY 

21:17:44 LOOKING AT WHAT IS KIND OF THE 
VISIONARY OPPORTUNITY WE HAVE IN 

21:17:49 FREMONT TO HAVE AN INTEGRATED 
COMPREHENSIVE TRAIL NETWORK.

21:17:53 AND THIS PLAN, BASICALLY, MORE 
THAN DOUBLES THE AMOUNT OF 

21:17:55 TRAILS THAT WE HAVE IN OUR 
COMMUNITY.

21:18:00 WE HAVE ABOUT 61 TRAILS NOW.
THE VISION PLAN LOOKS AT A 

21:18:06 LONG-RANGE PLAN OF 140 MILES.
SO MORE THAN DOUBLING, BUT 

21:18:10 THAT'S A LOT OF WORK TO DO.
SO ONE OF THE KEY ACTIONS OF 

21:18:16 THIS PLAN IS REALLY GOING 
THROUGH A PRIORITIZATION PROCESS 

21:18:19 AND IDENTIFYING WHAT IT IS WE 
SHOULD BE WORKING ON OVER THE 

21:18:21 NEXT TEN YEARS.
AND SO THIS CONSIDERS WHAT THE 

21:18:26 COMMUNITY IS INTERESTED IN.
WHAT SORT OF MAKES SENSE FROM A 

21:18:29 TRAIL NETWORK CONNECTIVITY 
PERSPECTIVE.

21:18:32 AND PROBABLY MOST SIGNIFICANTLY, 
IS WHERE IS THERE ACTUALLY AN 

21:18:35 OPPORTUNITY TO GET FUNDING TO DO 
NO?

21:18:40 AND SO SOME OF THE REALLY GOOD 
NEWS IS THAT WITHIN OUR BAY AREA 

21:18:46 REGION, WITHIN ALAMEDA COUNTY,  
STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND 

21:18:50 APPARENTLY EVEN AT THE FEDERAL 
LEVEL, THERE IS INTEREST IN 

21:18:54 DEVELOPING TRAILS BOTH FOR 
RECREATION AND TRANSPORTATION 

21:18:56 PURPOSES.
AND SO PART OF THIS PLAN IS 

21:19:00 REALLY A STRATEGIC OPPORTUNITY 
LOOK AT HOW WE CAN BEST 

21:19:05 CAPITALIZE ON MONEY FROM OTHER 
SOURCES.

21:19:09 AND SO I THINK THAT'S 
ESSENTIALLY JUST WHAT I WANTED 

21:19:13 DO SHARE WITH YOU, OUR STAFF 
REPORT HAS SOME MORE DETAILS 

21:19:16 ABOUT WHAT MAKES UP THE TEN-YEAR 
PLAN.

21:19:23 WE'VE INCLUDED ON OUR WEB PAGE A 
LOT OF OUR OUTREACH ON THIS WAS 

21:19:26 DONE DURING THE COVID TIME SO WE 
REALLY UTILIZED SOCIAL MEDIA AND 

21:19:29 OUR WEBSITE TO GET FEEDBACK FROM 
THE COMMUNITY.

21:19:35 SO FOR SEVERAL MONTHS NOW WE'VE 
HAD THE FINAL PLAN POSTED ON OUR 

21:19:38 WEBSITE.
IT'S MORE THAN A 100 PAGE PLAN 

21:19:42 WITH TWO APPENDICES.
SO A LOT OF DETAIL THERE.

21:19:47 WE THINK THIS IS READY TO SIGN 
OFF AND APPROVE AND, AGAIN, IT 

21:19:51 COMES WITH AN ENTHUSIASTIC 
ENDORSEMENT FROM BOTH THE 

21:19:54 RECREATION COMMISSION AND THE 
MOBILITY COMMISSION.

21:19:56 SO I'LL STOP THERE.
I KNOW YOU HAVE A VERY FULL 

21:20:01 AGENDA TONIGHT.
OUR STAFF IS HERE TO TAKE ANY 

21:20:03 DETAILED QUESTIONS THAT YOU 
MIGHT HAVE.

21:20:09 SO I'LL LEAVE IT THERE AND JUST 
LASTLY JUST KIND OF REITERATE 

21:20:12 KIND OF THE KUDOS TO COUNCIL FOR 
ALL OF YOUR PARTICIPATION IN THE 

21:20:15 ACTIVE FREMONT PROGRAM.
WE REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR 

21:20:18 LEADERSHIP IN GETTING THE 
COMMUNITY OUT TO ENJOY THE 

21:20:23 TRAILS THAT WE HAVE AND GENERATE 
KIND OF MORE EXCITEMENT FOR A 

21:20:27 GROWING TRAIL NETWORK.
AND AS YOU HEARD IN THE PREVIOUS 

21:20:30 PRESENTATION, HAVING MORE TRAILS 
IS REALLY AT THE STOP OF THE 

21:20:35 PRIORITY LIST FOR OUR COMMUNITY.
SO WE HOPE THIS PLAN HELPS 

21:20:37 DELIVER ON WHAT THE COMMUNITY 
WANTS.

21:20:40 SO AGAIN, WE'RE AVAILABLE FOR 
ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE ON 

21:20:44 THE TOPIC AND RECOMMEND YOUR 
APPROVAL HERE TONIGHT.

21:20:47 THANKS.
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

21:20:50 WE'LL BEGIN FIRST WITH 
CLARIFYING QUESTIONS FROM THE 

21:20:54 COUNCIL BEFORE I OPEN UP THE 
PUBLIC HEARING.

21:20:57 VICE MAYOR SHAO.
>> Councilmember Shao:   THANK 

21:20:59 YOU MADAM MAYOR.
FIRST OF ALL, YOU KNOW, I JUST 

21:21:04 WANT TO CONGRATULATE THE STAFF 
FOR YOUR HARD WORK.

21:21:11 AND YOU HAVE DONE SO MUCH AND 
TODAY, THE PLAN IS SOMETHING 

21:21:14 THAT IS THE EVIDENCE OF YOUR 
HARD WORK.

21:21:21 AND ONCE AGAIN, CONGRATULATIONS.
MY QUESTION WOULD BE, A, FOR A 

21:21:27 LOT OF TRAILS, AT THE TRAIL 
HEADS, ONE QUESTION IS ALWAYS 

21:21:35 THERE, ARE THERE ANY, ARE THERE 
ENOUGH PARKING SPACE FOR THE 

21:21:39 PEOPLE WHO LIKE TO TAKE 
ADVANTAGE OF THOSE TRAILS?

21:21:47 AND 2, DO WE HAVE ANY PLAN TO 
FURTHER PROMOTE, CAN RING 

21:21:54 TRAILS, FOR EXAMPLE, TAKE OVER 
UNION PACIFIC LAND, AND THEN 

21:22:01 CLEAN UP THE POLLUTION AND TURN 
THEM INTO TRAILS?

21:22:04 >> Hans Larsen:   YES, SO T THANK 
YOU FOR THE QUESTION.

21:22:08 AGAIN THIS PLAN IS MORE OF A 
HIGH LEVEL STRATEGY OF WHERE THE 

21:22:11 OPPORTUNITIES ARE AND THE 
PRIORITIES.

21:22:14 THERE IS A PRETTY KIND OF 
DETAILED ASSESSMENT OF WHAT'S 

21:22:16 INVOLVED WITH THE VARIOUS TRAIL 
CORRIDORS.

21:22:21 AND I WOULD CONCUR THAT WE'VE 
HEARD FROM THE COMMUNITY THAT 

21:22:25 YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO A ACCESS 
THE TRAILS.

21:22:29 SO THE QUESTION OF HOW THEY 
CONNECT AND WHERE THE ACCESS 

21:22:34 POINTS ARE AND WHERE IT'S 
APPROPRIATE TO HAVE PARKING LOTS 

21:22:38 FOR PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO GET TO 
AND ENJOY THEM, THAT WILL BE 

21:22:42 KIND OF A DETAIL THAT WE WORK 
THROUGH IN THE VARIOUS TRAIL 

21:22:47 PROJECTS, AS WE DEVELOP IN THE 
FUTURE.

21:22:51 REGARDING THE UNION PACIFIC 
CORRIDOR LET ME KIND OF PAINT 

21:22:54 THAT IN A LITTLE BIT OF A LARGER 
CONTEXT.

21:22:57 WHAT'S EXCITING ABOUT THIS PLAN 
IS THAT WE HEARD FROM THE 

21:22:59 COMMUNITY ABOUT A LOT OF 
DIFFERENT OPPORTUNITIES WHERE WE 

21:23:03 COULD RUN TRAILS.
AND SO WHETHER IT'S IN A PG&E 

21:23:10 EASEMENT OR IT IS ALONG A FLOOD 
CONTROL CHANNEL, OR IT'S IN 

21:23:13 RAILROAD CORRIDORS THAT AREN'T 
BEING USED, WE REALLY KIND OF 

21:23:16 EXPANDED THE VISION OF 
OPPORTUNITIES TO TAKE A LOOK AT 

21:23:22 SOME OF THESE OTHER PLACES.
AND THE AGENCIES THAT OWN THOSE 

21:23:26 CORRIDORS WERE PARTICIPANTS IN 
THE STRATEGY PROCESS.

21:23:34 SO THE ONLY U.P. TRAIL CORRIDOR 
THAT WE HAVE LOOKED AT, AND IT 

21:23:41 IS IN THE PLAN, IT IS NOT ONE OF 
OUR TEN-YEAR NEAR-TERM 

21:23:48 PRIORITIES.
JUST BECAUSE OF SORT OF ISSUES 

21:23:56 AND COSTS IN ACQUIRING THE 
CORRIDOR AND ISSUES THAT ARE 

21:23:57 GOING TO BE DIFFICULT TO DEAL 
WITH.

21:24:01 AS MANY ON THE COUNCIL KNOW WE 
WERE ACTIVELY PURSUING THAT 

21:24:05 PROJECT BUT BASICALLY CAME INTO 
A ROADBLOCK WITH U.P. AND TRYING 

21:24:08 TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN.
SO IT IS PART OF THE VISION.

21:24:12 BUT IT'S NOT ONE THAT WE SEE AS 
A REAL NEAR-TERM OPPORTUNITY.

21:24:17 SO IT'S MORE IN THE TEN TO 
30-YEAR PLAN AND AGAIN IS NOT 

21:24:21 ONE OF THOSE THAT'S, YOU KNOW, 
ON THE TOP PRIORITY LIST BUT 

21:24:24 IT'S STILL OUT THERE.
THANK YOU.

21:24:33 >> Mayor Mei:   PUBLIC SPEAKER 
AT THIS TIME AND THAT IS JUDY N 

21:24:37 
NAM.

21:24:40 >> GOOD EVENING.
I'D LIKE TO EXPRESS MY STRONG 

21:24:45 OPPOSITION TO LISTING MISSION 
CREEK TRAIL CLOSURE AS TO ONE OF 

21:24:49 THE YEAR 2 PRIORITY TRAILS IN 
THE MASTER PLAN.

21:24:52 CITY STAFF PRESENTED THIS 
PROJECT DURING A PUBLIC MEETING 

21:24:57 HELD BACK IN OCTOBER OF 2019.
A VAST MAJORITY OF OVER 100 

21:25:01 RESIDENTS EXPRESSED STRONG 
OPPOSITION BECAUSE OF POTENTIAL 

21:25:04 ENVIRONMENTAL RISK.
THE MOST PRISTINE PORTION OF 

21:25:10 MISSION PEAK WITH MANY 
VULNERABLE WILD LIFE AND 

21:25:16 VEGETATION.
IN ADDITION THE HOMENESS 

21:25:26 ENCAMPMENT INCIDENT, THAT TOOK 
NEARLY YEAR AND A HALF AMPLY 

21:25:37 SUGGESTS.
CURRENT O AND M ESTIMATE IS 

21:25:43 WOEFULLY INQUAD ADEQUATE.
FUTURE PUBLIC MEETING WITH 

21:25:47 NEARBY RESIDENTS TO BE 
SCHEDULED.

21:25:51 AS FAR AS COMMUNITIES SANTA 
BARBARA, VIA SAN MRI GEL, 

21:25:56 WALKING AND BIKING TRAILS 
CURRENTLY THERE IS NO UTTERS OF 

21:26:01  URGENCY OF 
THE PROJECTS.

21:26:07 680 ON RAMP TO MILL CREEK HAS 
NOT EVEN STARTED AND MAY NOT BE 

21:26:16 EVEN FEASIBLE KNOWING 
FEASIBILITY WITH CALTRANS.

21:26:20 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.
NEXT SPEAKER IS LIZ AIMES.

21:26:30 >> GOOD EVENING AGAIN LIZ AIMES.
I'M ALSO A BOARD MEMBER OF THE 

21:26:35 TRICITY ECOLOGY CENTER AS WELL 
AS A BART DIRECTOR, I HAVE TWO 

21:26:37 HATS.
BUT ESSENTIALLY, YOU KNOW, 

21:26:46 DOUBLING OUR TRAILS TO Q 140 MILES 
IS KEY TO SUCCESS.

21:26:52 I THINK OF A CITY LIKE BOULDER, 
COLORADO THEY PASSED A SALES TAX 

21:26:57 IF YOU CAN BELIEVE IT IN THE 
60s, LATE 1960s, IT WAS A 

21:27:02 HALF CENT SALES TAX AND THEY 
RENEWED IT AT PERIODIC TIMES.

21:27:06 AND WHAT THEY HAVE DONE IS 
CREATED A CLASS 1 UH 1 TRAIL 

21:27:10 NETWORK THROUGHOUT BOULDER.
AND 30 YEARS LATER BOULDER, 

21:27:13 COLORADO WAS TRANSFORMED FROM 
LIKE A SUBURB CITY THAT IT WAS A 

21:27:19 COMMUTER CITY, PEOPLE WERE 
COMMUTING TO DENVER, WITH THIS 

21:27:25 INFRASTRUCTURE THAT THEY CREATED 
WITH TRAILS AND OPEN SPACES, 

21:27:28 CONSERVATION AREAS, IT BECAME A 
PLACE WHERE PEOPLE WERE 

21:27:32 COMMUTING TO BOULDER.
SO AGAIN, THIS IS KEY TO 

21:27:35 ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT.
WHEN YOU LOOK AT CLIMATE CHANGE 

21:27:39 AND ALL OF THESE ISSUES THAT 
WE'RE FACING, THAT WILL COST A 

21:27:46 LOT IN THE FUTURE TO MITIGATE 
THIS TRAIL PLAN IS ESSENTIAL TO 

21:27:51 I THINK FREMONT SUCCESS AND 
FREMONT ALL OF THESE SUBURBS 

21:27:54 WERE NOT DESIGNED FOR PEOPLE.
THEY WERE DESIGNED FOR CARS.

21:27:59 SO PLEASE I HOPE WE CAN FIND THE 
MONEY AND GET THIS TRAIL PLAN 

21:28:01 IMPLEMENTED.
THANK YOU.

21:28:08 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.
NEXT SPEAKER IS WILLIAM URUGI.

21:28:14 >> GOOD EVENING, WILLIAM URUGI, 
MISSION PEAK CONSERVANCY.

21:28:21 KUDOS TO SUZANNE WOLF AND HANS 
LARSON FOR BRINGING THIS 

21:28:25  PLAN 
TOGETHER AND MAKING SURE THAT 

21:28:29 EVERYBODY IS IN AGREEMENT TO 
WHAT THE EXPECTED OUTCOME IN 

21:28:36  IS 
WITH A TRAIL STATEMENT.

21:28:38 IT IS A REMARKABLE VISION 
STATEMENT.

21:28:41 IT PULLS TOGETHER LOTS OFF 
RESOURCES FROM LOTS OF DIFFERENT 

21:28:44 ENTITIES AND WE AS AN 
ORGANIZATION FULLY SUPPORT THIS 

21:28:48 PLAN.
WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE 20 YEARS 

21:28:51 OF WORK AND SUPPORT TO FULLY 
IMPLEMENT IT.

21:28:55 IF IT TAKES ANOTHER TEN OR 15 
YEARS TO BRING THE GREENWAY 

21:28:58 TRAIL IN THAT'S FINE.
WE'RE HAPPY TO SUPPORT THE 

21:29:02 EXPANSION OF MULTIPLE USE TRAILS 
THROUGHOUT FREMONT AND THEIR 

21:29:03 INTERCONNECTIVITY.
THANK YOU.

21:29:10 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU, NEXT 
SPEAKER IS KELLY.

21:29:14 WELCOME.
WHOOPS.

21:29:20 NOPE, OKAY.
NEXT SPEAKER IS -- OH THERE YOU 

21:29:24 ARE.
>> I'M HERE FINALLY.

21:29:29 THE -- WHEN IT COMES TO BUILDING 
TRAILS AND WE GET THESE -- YOU 

21:29:33 GET THE OPPOSITION IN FREMONT, 
THE FROM LOCAL RESIDENTS TO 

21:29:38 HAVING A MULTIUSE TRAIL 
SOMEWHERE DOWN IN A CANYON 

21:29:46 SOMEWHERE, AND IT BEING PROPOSED 
BY THE CITY STAFF, IS -- IS 

21:29:51 PREDICTABLE, ENTIRELY EXPECTED 
AND ASTONISHING TO ME AT THE 

21:29:56 SAME TIME.
I JUST WENT TO A MEETING OF SOME 

21:30:01 POLITICAL MEETING OF DUBLIN CITY 
COUNCIL AND A LOALG WATER 

21:30:04 AGENCIES AND THEY WERE TALKING 
ABOUT THIS IRON HORSE TRAIL AND 

21:30:09 ALL DUBLIN WAS ASKING WAS, HOW 
CAN WE PUT TOGETHER ENOUGH MONEY 

21:30:11 TO MAKE A NICE IMPROVEMENT ON 
THIS TRAIL?

21:30:14 AND NOBODY WAS CALLED -- 
EVERYBODY WAS HAPPY WITH THE 

21:30:16 TRAIL.
THE ONLY QUESTION WAS HOW DO WE 

21:30:19 MAKE IT BETTER.
NOBODY WAS CALLING UP TO SAY 

21:30:22 THAT THIS TRAIL IS PRODUCING 
CRIME AND DESTROYING OUR 

21:30:24 NEIGHBORHOOD AND LOWERING OUR 
PROPERTY VALUES.

21:30:32 IF YOU LOOK AT SABERCAT CREEK 
TRAIL NEAR PASEO PADRE, I'M A 

21:30:35 LITTLE BIT SURPRISED THAT -- I 
REMEMBER HOW THIS THING USED TO 

21:30:39 BE A, YOU KNOW, AN OKAY TRAIL 
AND THE CITY HAS UPGRADED IT 

21:30:43 S 
SOMEWHAT.

21:30:46 NOT ONLY IT LOOKS GOOD BUT IT 
HAS A LOT OF PEOPLE PARKED THERE 

21:30:51 AND A LOT OF PEOPLE USING IT.
SO THESE TRAILS ARE VERY NICE.

21:30:55 AND PEOPLE, THE OPPOSITION, I'M 
STILL ATON THAISHED THERE'S SO 

21:31:05  ASTONISHED THAT THERE IS 
SO MUCH OF IT.

21:31:10 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU, NEXT 
SPEAKER IS ANDREAS.

21:31:17 YOU ARE ON MUTE.
>> GOOD EVENING, ANDREAS 

21:31:21 KADAVANE OF BIKE FREMONT.
WE THINK THIS DESIGN IS A 

21:31:28 BEAUTIFUL EXAMPLE, I THINK THE 
RECREATION DEPARTMENT AND THE 

21:31:32 PARKS DEPARTMENT HAS DONE A 
FANTASTIC JOB, MY ONLY REGRET IS 

21:31:36 WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE SEEN THE 
PLANNING DEPARTMENT INVOLVED A 

21:31:39 LITTLE BIT MORE.
WE FULLY SUPPORT THIS PLAN AND 

21:31:41 ITS IMPLEMENTATION.
WITH REGARDS TO THAT AND THERE 

21:31:47 WAS SOME MENTION EARLIER ABOUT 
COSTS, THERE IS A SOMEWHAT SCARY 

21:31:51 MULTIMILLION DOLLAR MAINTENANCE 
COST FIGURE IN THE REPORT.

21:31:56 I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT IT 
COMES OUT TO SOMETHING LIKE $15 

21:32:00 PER RESIDENT PER YEAR WHICH IS 
FLOG TO SNEEZE AT.

21:32:03 THERE IS A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT 
WOULD NOT BE WILLING TO PAY THAT 

21:32:07 AND SHOULDN'T HAVE TO PAY THAT 
BUT THERE IS LOTS OF PEOPLE LIKE 

21:32:10 ME THAT WOULD GLADLY PAY 
MULTIPLES OF THAT.

21:32:13 I HOPE WE DPIEBD WAYS TO MAKE 
THIS HAPPEN AND FINANCE IT IN A 

21:32:16 EQUITABLE WAY.
WITH THAT I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO 

21:32:20 POINT OUT A LOT OF THESE TRAILS 
ARE TRANSPORTATION FACILITIES.

21:32:24 AND I KNOW IN EUROPE A LOT OF 
CASES THEY ARE TREATED AS SUCH 

21:32:27 FOR FUNDING PURPOSES.
AND I KNOW THE MOBILITY 

21:32:31 COMMISSION HAS ACTIVITIES TO 
LOBBY THE STATE GOVERNMENT TO 

21:32:34 IMPROVE DID WAY THE LAWS ARE 
WITH REGARDS TO OSOME OF THESE 

21:32:38 FACILITIES.
SO IF WE CAN FIND CREATIVE WAYS 

21:32:42 TO ACTUALLY USE TRANSPORTATION 
FUNDS TO MAINTAIN SOME OF THESE 

21:32:45 THINGS THAT WOULD BE FANTASTIC.
BUT AGAIN WE FULLY SUPPORT THIS 

21:32:47 PLAN WE FULLY SUPPORT THE 
TRANSFER OF MONEY.

21:32:57 AB>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.
NEXT SPEAKER IS STEVE SCALA.

21:33:01 WELCOME STEVE.
>> THANK YOU, I ALSO WANT TO 

21:33:04 EXTEND MY THANKS TO STAFF FOR 
GENERATING THIS REPORT.

21:33:09 I THINK ALSO, PAY ATTENTION, 
THERE'S MENTION OF AN APPENDIX G 

21:33:13 AND F DEALING WITH DETAILS OF 
FUNDING AND MAINTENANCE 

21:33:15 RESPECTFULLY.
I THINK THAT IS VERY IMPORTANT 

21:33:20 FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION, DETAILS 
MENTIONED, THIS IS SOMEWHAT 

21:33:24 IMPORTANT TO ME.
I STARTED INTEREST IN TRAILS 

21:33:28 ABOUT 20 YEARS AGO, WHEN MY 
CHILDREN WERE STARTING TO RIDE 

21:33:33 BICYCLES AND I WANT THEM TO BE 
ABLE TO TAKE TRAILS TO THEIR 

21:33:36 FAVORITE PARK.
FOR THEM WE'RE 20 YEARS TOO LATE 

21:33:40 SO I REALLY WANT TO EMPHASIZE 
WITH COUNCIL NEXT TIME YOU'RE IN 

21:33:43 THE COMMUNITY AND YOU SEE YOUNG 
CHILDREN LEARNING TO BICYCLE 

21:33:46 OPEN THIS PLAN LOOK AT THE 
PRIORITY PROJECTS, LOOK 

21:33:50 ESPECIALLY AT THE DETAILS FOR 
FUNDING AND MAINTENANCE AND WHAT 

21:33:53 IT TAKES TO IMPLEMENT THESE 
PROJECTS.

21:33:57 AND DO THE HARD WORK TO START 
WORKING WITH STAFF TO FIND 

21:34:01 SOLUTIONS.
SO WE CAN GET THE TRAILS THAT SO 

21:34:09 MANY PEOPLE ARE ASKING FOR AND 
ARE ENVISIONED IN THIS PLAN.

21:34:12 THANKS.
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

21:34:18 THE NEXT SPEAKER IS IS KATHY H. 
H.

21:34:21 >> YES, GOOD AFTERNOON, CITY 
COUNCIL AND EVERYBODY HERE.

21:34:25 I AM ACTUALLY ONE OF THE PEOPLE 
WHO WAS INVOLVED IN THOSE 

21:34:27 EARLIER MEETINGS, BACK IN 
OCTOBER.

21:34:32 I'M KIND OF DISAPPOINTED THAT WE 
HAD ASKED THAT WHEN THEY CAME UP 

21:34:36 WITH A PLAN, AND ADDRESSED SOME 
OF THE ISSUES THAT WE HAD, THAT 

21:34:40 WE WOULD ACTUALLY HAVE SOMEBODY 
WHO WOULD COME FORTH AND ARRANGE 

21:34:43 MEETINGS FOR US.
WE HAD ASKED FOR PEOPLE TO TALK 

21:34:47 TO US ABOUT THE DIFFERENT 
ISSUES, INCLUDING WHO WOULD 

21:34:49 MAINTAIN THESE TRAILS 
AFTERWARDS.

21:34:52 BECAUSE THIS IS ALAMEDA COUNTY 
FLOOD CONTROL.

21:34:56 AND WE KNOW OVER FOR MANY OF US 
WHO LIVE UP IN THIS 

21:34:59 NEIGHBORHOOD, ORIGINALLY THE 
CITY WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL THE 

21:35:01 SIDEWALKS.
AND THEN AS THE TREES THAT THEY 

21:35:06 PLANTED ALONG THE SIDEWALKS 
ERODED, THE SIDEWALKS AND LIFTED 

21:35:09 THEM UP, IT WAS TURNED OVER TO 
ALL OF THE HOMEOWNERS TO TAKE 

21:35:12 CARE EVER THIS.
NOW THE CREEK THAT -- OR THE 

21:35:15 CREEK PATH THAT IS UP IN THE 
MISSION AREA GOING TO 680 TO 

21:35:19 PALM, THIS RUNS IMMEDIATELY 
BEHIND A LOT OF HOMES THAT ARE 

21:35:27 CURRENTLY HOUSED AND OWNED BY 
ELDERLY FAMILIES.

21:35:33 THEY HAVE CHAIN LINK FINING.
WE HAVE ASKED, THERE ARE PEOPLE 

21:35:36 WHO WALK THROUGH AND LOOKING 
INTO PEOPLE'S BACKYARDS.

21:35:40 WE HAD QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS, 
NOBODY HAS ADDRESSED OUR 

21:35:45 QUESTIONS, NO MEETINGS HAVE BEEN 
SET UP NOW AISTLES WE HAVE THIS 

21:35:49 TRAIL THAT'S GOING TO BE 
APPROVED IT SOUNDS LIKE TONIGHT.

21:35:52 WE ARE CONCERNED, WE HAVE 
ISSUES, WE WANTED OUR QUESTIONS 

21:35:54 ANSWERED BUT WE NEVER MET WITH 
ANYBODY.

21:35:59 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU AND 
THAT WAS THE LAST OF THE PUBLIC 

21:36:01 SPEAKERS.
AND NOW I'LL TURN IT BACK TO THE 

21:36:03 COUNCIL FOR CONVERSATIONS AND 
COMMENTS.

21:36:11 AND ALSO DECISIONS.
WE'LL BEGIN E-BEGIN WITH 

21:36:17  WITH COUNCILMEMBER 
KENG.

21:36:19 >> Councilmember Keng:   THANK 
YOU MAYOR MEI.

21:36:21 THANK YOU FOR THE 
INTERDEPARTMENTAL TRAIL STUDY.

21:36:26 I THINK WE ARE VERY BLESSED TO 
HAVE ALREADY 61 MILES OF TRAILS 

21:36:32 AND WE'RE TRYING TO EXTEND IT TO 
140 MILES IN TEN YEARS OR 

21:36:34 MAYBE -- I THINK THAT'S THE TEN 
YEAR GOAL RIGHT?

21:36:42 AND THEN WITH THE 12 TRAIL 
PROJECTS, 171 MILLION, AND WHILE 

21:36:52 I DO, YOU KNOW, SUPPORT HAVING 
MORE TRAIL OPTIONS FOR PEOPLE TO 

21:36:56 EXPLORE EXPLORE AND DO OUTDOOR 
ACTIVITIES AND HIKING I AM A 

21:37:00 LITTLE BIT CONCERNED ABOUT HOW 
MUCH WE'RE TRYING TO DO AND AWAY 

21:37:04 KIND OF ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT 
THAT COULD POSSIBLY BRING.

21:37:09 I DO SHARE WITH SOME OF THE 
RESIDENTS CONCERNS HERE THAT, 

21:37:14 YOU KNOW, WE DO NEED TO BE 
CAREFUL, WE DO NEED TO TAKE INTO 

21:37:18 CONSIDERATION CEQA, WHILE WE ARE 
TRYING TO MAKE TRAILS OUT OF THE 

21:37:25 EXISTING HILLS.
SO I KNOW MISSION PEAK A LOT, 

21:37:29 THIS IS THE DEMAND FOR MORE 
TRAILS.

21:37:33 AND, YOU KNOW, BECAUSE MISSION 
PEAK IS SO -- SUCH A DESTINATION 

21:37:36 NOW, PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER THE 
BAY AREA ARE COMING TO HIKE 

21:37:41 MISSION PEAK AND HONESTLY MAKING 
KIND OF MAKING IT HARD FOR THE 

21:37:48 PEOPLE THAT DO LIVE OVER THERE.
AND I DO SUPPORT IN KIND OF 

21:37:54 BUILDING MORE TRAILS.
BUT I -- YEAH, I THINK WE NEED 

21:37:58 TO BE KIND OF CAREFUL IN GOING 
ABOUT THAT NOT TO BE 

21:38:03 SUPERAGGRESSIVE.
AND ALSO, THIS BUDGETING OF, YOU 

21:38:09 KNOW, SPENDING $171 MILLION OF 
DOLLARS, IF WE DO HAVE THAT 

21:38:15 BUDGET IN TEN YEARS EACH YEAR 
YOU ARE LOOKING AT $17 MILLION.

21:38:19 AND I THINK WE NEED TO KIND OF 
BALANCE IT OUT OBETWEEN BUILDING 

21:38:24 THE TRAILS AND LIKE THE PARKS 
AND RECS AND LIKE THE INDOOR OR 

21:38:27 OTHER NEEDS THAT WE HAVE OR AT 
COMMUNITY CENTERS YOU KNOW THAT 

21:38:31 WE DON'T HAVE FUNDING FOR.
YEAH WE NEED TO KIND OF BALANCE 

21:38:36 IT OUT AND HAVING SOME OUTDOOR, 
YOU KNOW, SPACES AND ACTUALLY 

21:38:39 STUFF PEOPLE CAN DO BUT ALSO 
HAVE THOSE INDOOR AND OTHER 

21:38:43 PROGRAMS THAT PEOPLE CAN ENJOY 
IN WINTER TIME OR WHEN THE 

21:38:50 ELEMENTS OF THE WEATHER IS NOT 
FEASIBLE FOR YOUNGER FOLKS OR 

21:38:59 THAT WE HAVE MORE OPTIONS.
SO THAT'S MY INPUT, THANK YOU.

21:39:02 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.
COUNCILMEMBER COX.

21:39:02 >> Councilmember Cox:   THANK 
YOU.

21:39:08 I FIRST WANT TO THANK SUZANNE 
WOLF AND HER STAFF FOR THE 

21:39:13 WONDERFUL CONCERTS THAT HAVE 
BEEN SO ENJOYABLE.

21:39:16 AND BRINGING US BACK TO SOME 
WONDERFUL MEMORIES OF HAVING FUN 

21:39:23 IN THE PARK.
AND ALSO, I DON'T THINK OUR 

21:39:26 COMMUNITY WALK WILL EVER BE THE 
SAME.

21:39:30 IT WAS SO FANTASTIC.
I WANT TO THANK SUZANNE AND THE 

21:39:35 COLLABORATION OF OUR FREMONT 
FIRE CHIEF AND DEPUTY CHIEF 

21:39:39 JACOBSEN AND DEPUTY CHIEF DIAZ 
AND THE ENTIRE FREMONT FIRE 

21:39:42 DEPARTMENT.
AND ALSO, THE FREMONT POLICE.

21:39:49 IT WAS A GREAT A COLLABORATION AND 
WITH THE IRVINGTON LIBRARY WE 

21:39:52 DID FOR THE COMMUNITY WALK AND 
IT REALLY HIGHLIGHTS THAT IT 

21:39:57 TAKES A LOT OF PRIVATE-PUBLIC 
PARTNERSHIPS TO BRING OUT 

21:40:03 PROGRAMS.
AND I THINK ONE OF THE WONDERFUL 

21:40:06 THINGS WITH THIS NEW DEVELOPMENT 
WITH THE TRAILS AND I APPRECIATE 

21:40:09 HANS AND HIS COLLABORATION WITH 
SUZANNE ON THIS PROJECT THAT IF 

21:40:13 WE DON'T HAVE A PLAN, WE DON'T 
HAVE -- IF WE DON'T HAVE THE 

21:40:17 VISION WE DON'T HAVE A PLAN TO 
BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT SOMETHING 

21:40:20 THAT IS HIGHLIGHTING THE BEAUTY 
OF FREMONT.

21:40:24 WHICH IS VERY DIFFERENT COMPARED 
TO OTHER BAY AREAS.

21:40:28 BECAUSE WE DO HAVE HILLS AND WE 
DO HAVE FLAT LAND.

21:40:33 WE DO HAVE BEAUTIFUL FORESTRY 
AND PARKS THAT REALLY COMPLEMENT 

21:40:38 WHY PEOPLE COMB TO LIVE, WORK 
AND PLAY HERE IN FREMONT.

21:40:42 AND I THINK ONE OF THE KEY PARTS 
ALSO IS LOOKING OUT AND SEE AS 

21:40:47 WE HAVE THIS TRAIL PLAN WHICH 
IT'S KIND OF ON A CUTTING EDGE, 

21:40:51 THAT WE HAVE PUBLIC-PRIVATE 
PARTNERSHIPS THAT MAYBE WE COULD 

21:40:55 BE REACHING OUT AND CROSS, SINCE 
OUR CITY STAFF HAS BEEN 

21:40:59 WONDERFUL IN COLLABORATIONS THAT 
WE COLLABORATE WITH ECONOMIC 

21:41:03 DEVELOPMENT AND SEEING HOW SOME 
OF THE BUSINESSES MAY BE ABLE TO 

21:41:05 HELP SPONSOR SOME OF THESE 
DIFFERENT TRAILS.

21:41:13 YOU HAVE THE ADOPT A HIGHWAY, 
WELL, ADOPT A TRAIL.

21:41:17 AND BEING ABLE TO HELP IN TERMS 
OF FUNDING SOME OF THE ISSUES, 

21:41:20 IT DOES COST MONEY TO MAINTAINED 
BUT IT WOULD BE VERY UNIQUE TO 

21:41:28 HAVE A DIFFERENT TRAIL NAMED BY 
TESLA OR BY LAMB RESEARCH OR BY 

21:41:30 WESTERN DIGITAL.
SO WE HAVE SOME REALLY 

21:41:33 WONDERFUL, BIG AND SMALL 
COMPANIES HERE IN FREMONT THAT 

21:41:37 THAT COULD BE SOMETHING THAT WE 
COULD TALK ABOUT AND SEE HOW 

21:41:42 THEY CAN HELP IN SUPPORTING THIS 
NEW INITIATIVE.

21:41:46 IT'S GOING OUT FOR THE FUTURE.
ISTS NOT JUST FOR PRINT.

21:41:50 IT'S FOR GENERATIONS TO COME.
AND I THINK IT WOULD BE SO 

21:41:55 EXCITING TO BE ABLE TO HELP IN 
THOSE WAYS OF MAINTAINING THE 

21:42:02 PARKS AND THE TRAILS.
BUT SOMETHING THAT, TAKINGS US 

21:42:06 AWAY FROM OUR PHONES AND FROM 
OUR TVS AND FROM OUR NORMAL 

21:42:10 THINGS THAT WE DO ON A ROUTINE 
THAT WE -- IT'S ALLOWING US TO 

21:42:16 BE A DIVERSE COMMUNITY WITH 
EQUITY AND ACCESS TO EVERYONE.

21:42:21 AND I THINK THAT'S PART OF THE 
VISION THAT'S ALSO ADDED IN AS 

21:42:26 PART OF OUR GOALS AND PRIORITIES 
THAT WE DO HAVE SET UP AS ALL OF 

21:42:30 US WORKING TOGETHER TO TAKE 
FREMONT TO THE NEXT LEVEL TO 

21:42:33 THRIVE.
SO I JUST WANTED TO ADD A COUPLE 

21:42:38 OF COMMENTS ON THAT.
AND I REALLY APPRECIATE ALL THE 

21:42:43 HARD WORK AND GOING FROM THE 
COMMUNITY PARK LAYOUTS AND I 

21:42:54 NEVER IMAGINED WE HAD ALMOST  
7300 ACRES AND MORE TRAILS IN 

21:42:58 ADDITION TO ALL OF THE ABUSE 
PARKS AND THAT WE HAVE AROUND 

21:43:04 HERE.
SO I'D BE REALLY FULLY SUPPORT 

21:43:07 AND MAKING A MOTION TO MOVE 
FORWARD WITH THIS TRAIL PLAN 

21:43:11 STRATEGY.
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

21:43:14 COUNCILMEMBER JONES AND THEN I 
HAVE ALSO MY COMMENTS TO ADD, 

21:43:25 THANK YOU.
AGAIN COUNCILMEMBER JONES 

21:43:27 UNFORTUNATELY I'M HAVING 
PROBLEMS HEARING YOU.

21:43:48 WE'RE STILL HAVING PROBLEMS.
I'M GOING TO TURN TO VICE MAYOR 

21:43:52 SHAO FOR A SECOND WHILE WE WAIT 
TO GET YOU BACK.

21:43:54 >> Councilmember Shao:   SORRY, 
COUNCILMEMBER JONES, I'LL TAKE 

21:43:57 YOUR PLACE.
I JUST WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU 

21:44:03 THAT FOR THE LAST LONG WEEKEND, 
ON LABOR DAY, I HAD THE PLEASURE 

21:44:17 TO WALK THE THE MORRISON PARK 
TRAIL AND GET TO KNOW MORE ABOUT 

21:44:21 THE POTENTIAL OF ALL THE TRAIL 
DEVELOPMENTS AND I WOULD SAY 

21:44:24 THAT, YOU KNOW, FREMONT ASK SUCH 
A BEAUTIFUL CITY, WHILE IN 

21:44:27 PANDEMIC A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE 
INDOORS BUT COMING OUT AND 

21:44:30 WALKING ON TRAIL WOULD 
DEFINITELY PROMOTE THE HEALTH 

21:44:34 AND FITNESS OF THE LOCAL 
RESIDENTS.

21:44:42 ON THE TRAIL I MET WITH A LOT OF  
FREMONT RESIDENTS.

21:44:59 OBVIOUSLY MORRISON CANYON TRAIL 
WAS NOT THE AS FAMOUS.

21:45:05  AS FAMOUS.
I'M HOPING WITH FUTURE 

21:45:09 DEVELOPMENT AND OTHER SUPPORTING 
SERVICES LIKE PARKING AND OTHER 

21:45:13 SERVICES LOCAL RESIDENTS WILL 
FIND MORE AND MORE EASY TO USE 

21:45:17 THE LOCAL TRAILS.
SO ONCE AGAIN, I'M REALLY 74th 

21:45:25  
SUPPORTIVE TO THIS PLAN AND I 

21:45:30 HOPE WE CAN GET FUNDING TO PUT 
THE DEVELOPMENT OOF THE TRAILS 

21:45:36  DEVELOPMENT OF THE TRAILS 
INTO REALITY.

21:45:40 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.
I'M GOING TO TRY TO GOOD E-GO 

21:45:43 OTHE COUNCILMEMBER JONES TO SEE 
IF IT'S WORKING NOW.

21:45:45 >> Councilmember Jones:   OKAY 
CAN YOU HEAR ME?

21:45:49 APPARENTLY WHEN ONE EAR POD 
DIES, THE OTHER ONE SAYS YOU 

21:45:52 CAN'T TALK ANYMORE.
ANYWAY I JUST WANTED TO THANK 

21:45:55 SUZANNE AND HANS FOR ALL THE 
WORK THEY'VE DONE ON THIS 

21:45:58 PROJECT.
I KNOW IT'S BEEN A LOT OF INS 

21:46:03 AND OUTS AND I THINK IT'S AN 
AMAZING THING WE HAVE ALL THESE 

21:46:05 TRAILS THROUGHOUT FREMONT AND 
WE'RE GOING TO MORE THAN DOUBLE 

21:46:07 THAT.
I JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY THAT 

21:46:11 OUR DISCUSSION TONIGHT, WHILE 
WE'RE APPROVING THE TRAIL 

21:46:15 STRATEGY PLAN THAT'S KIND OF THE 
OVERARCHING DREAM THAT WE HAVE 

21:46:21 AND NOT NECESSARILY THAT ALL OF 
THESE TRAILS ARE GOING TO COME 

21:46:23 TO FRUITION.
AND IT'S ALL GOING TO BE BASED 

21:46:26 ON FUNDING AND COMMUNITY 
OUTREACH AND EVERYTHING ELSE.

21:46:29 SO BASICALLY WHAT WE'RE LOOKING 
AT TONIGHT IS JUST IF APPROVAL 

21:46:35  THE APPROVAL 
FOR PAYING FOR THIS PLAN 

21:46:40  
APPARENTLY.

21:46:43 I'M GOING TO GUESS BECAUSE I FLO 
THE WAY THE TWO OF YOU WORK THAT 

21:46:46 THERE WILL BE COMMUNITY OUTREACH 
BEFORE ANY OF THESE ACTUAL 

21:46:49 TRAILS ARE IMPLEMENTED IN 
VARIOUS COMMUNITIES.

21:46:52 AND I HAVE EVERY FAITH THAT 
YOU'LL GET THE COMMUNITIES ON 

21:46:59 BOARD TO GET THESE THINGS DONE.
THIS IS -- IT'S A 30 YEAR PLAN.

21:47:03 SO YOU KNOW IT'S GOING TO TAKE A 
LITTLE BIT OF TIME AND HOPEFULLY 

21:47:05 WE CAN FIND A LITTLE BIT OF 
FUNDING TO MOVE FORWARD WITH 

21:47:09 THAT, THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

21:47:13 I'M GOING TO JUST MAKE MY QUICK 
COMMENTS AND THEN WE'LL MOVE ON.

21:47:17 WE STILL ONE MORE AGENDA OR AT 
LEAST -- COUPLE MORE AGENDA 

21:47:20 ITEMS NOW.
BUT REAL QUICKLY.

21:47:23 I KNOW THIS IS DID BEGINNING OF 
THE 30 YEAR PLAN.

21:47:26 THIS IS AGAIN THE APPROVING JUST 
AS COUNCILMEMBER JONES SAID, 

21:47:34 IT'S THE TRANSFER OR THE T COST TO 
FUND THIS STUDY AND MOVING 

21:47:37 FORWARD WE'RE GOING TO NEED 
ADDITIONAL RESOURCES.

21:47:41 THAT'S WHY IT'S IMPORTANTLY WE 
MAKE THE ADDITIONAL EFFORTS.

21:47:53 I KNOW A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO WE 
HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO MEET WITH 

21:47:58 THE SECRETARY, WADE CROWFOOT.
OVER THE YEARS I'VE HAD THE 

21:48:02 PLEASURE TO SEE LIKE IN LANDING 
PARKWAY AND OTHER AREAS WHERE 

21:48:05 WE'VE HAD DIFFERENT CORPORATIONS 
STEP UP TO HELP US WITH SOME OF 

21:48:07 THE MAINTENANCE.
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THE FIRST 

21:48:10 MILE AND LEAS MILE AND IT'S 
SOMETHING THAT HOPEFULLY WE'LL 

21:48:14 BE ABLE TO CONTINUE THOSE 
PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS 

21:48:17 WHETHER IT'S WITH AGENCIES LIKE 
BART OR OTHERS AND THEN WITH 

21:48:20 COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS.
BUT THIS IS SOMETHING I THINK 

21:48:22 THAT IS A GOOD VISION FOR US TO 
SET.

21:48:25 I AGREE THAT I WAS LISTENING TO 
ONE OF THE SPEAKERS TALK ABOUT 

21:48:29 EARLIER AND I STILL REMEMBER 
TAKING MY THEN LITTLE KIDS TO 

21:48:32 FEED HORSES TON TRAILS.
THEY WERE JUST FEEDING THEM 

21:48:35 SUGAR CUBES AND NOW THEY'RE 
YOUNG ADULTS.

21:48:38 I'D LIKE TO SAY I DON'T HAVE TO 
WAIT FOR SOME OF MY 

21:48:40 GRANDCHILDREN FOR THIS NEXT 
STEP.

21:48:44 I'D LIKE US TO MOVE AFFORD.
I'M PASSIONATE THAT WE WORK ON 

21:48:47 THIS IN TERMS OF AT LEAST 
SETTING THE PLAN AND THEN 

21:48:49 SEEKING THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING.
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THE ENTIRE 

21:48:52 COUNCIL CAN DO IN TERMS OF 
LOBBYING OUR LEGISLATORS AND 

21:48:55 WORKING WITH OTHER ADVOCACY 
EFFORTS.

21:49:00 I FLO THAT YEARS AGO MEASURE W 
FOR SETTING SITES ON THE PARK 

21:49:04 LANDS WORKING WITH THE SCHOOL 
DISTRICT ON SOME OF THESE THINGS 

21:49:07 AND ARE GOING TO BE CRITICAL 
MOVING FORWARD.

21:49:11 WITH NO DOUBT WE'VE HEARD FROM 
SPEAKERS THIS EVENING BUT WE 

21:49:13 WILL ALSO BE WORKING WITH 
COMMUNITY MEMBERS.

21:49:16 WHAT I'VE SEEN WHERE THE 
DEVELOPMENTS THAT HAVE HAPPENED 

21:49:19 WITH IRON HORSE TRAIL AND OTHER 
THINGS THAT IT TENDS TO BE A 

21:49:21 COMMUNITY BLESSING AND IT'S 
SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE CRITICALLY 

21:49:26 NEED RIGHT NOW AS AN OPTION IN 
TERMS OF WAYS TO GET OUTDOORS, 

21:49:30 WHETHER IT'S THROUGH BIKING, 
WALKING OR OTHER OPPORTUNITIES 

21:49:33 TO RECREATE.
SO THANK YOU AGAIN TO SUZANNE 

21:49:35 AND THE STAFF AND TO THE 
COMMUNITY MEMBERS WHO WANT TO BE 

21:49:39 PARTICIPATING IN THIS AND OUR 
COMMISSIONS BOTH THE MOBILITY 

21:49:43 AND OUR BIKE COMMISSIONS IN 
TERMS OF THEIR EFFORTS.

21:49:46 SO I THINK THAT WITH THIS I 
WOULD LIKE TO GET A MOTION.

21:49:49 I HAVE ONE MOTION ALREADY BY 
COUNCILMEMBER COX AND A SECOND 

21:49:52 BY COUNCILMEMBER JONES.
SO LET'S GO AHEAD AN TAKE A 

21:49:57 D TAKE A 
VOTE.

21:50:07 SORRY.
SUSAN I'M HAVING DIFFICULTY 

21:50:15 HEARING YOU RIGHT NOW.
CLE COUNCILMEMBER COX.

21:50:18 >> YES COUNCILMEMBER COX.
AYE.

21:50:21 COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN.
AYE.

21:50:30 COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, AYE.
COUNCILMEMBER KENG, AYE.

21:50:33 VICE MAYOR SHAO, AYE.
MAYOR MEI.

21:50:37 AYE.
>> Mayor Mei:   SO THE MOTION TO 

21:50:40 ADOPT THE APPROVAL OF THE 
FREMONT TRAIL STRATEGY PLAN IS 

21:50:45 UNANIMOUS PAP NEXT IS ITEM 7C 
WHICH IS THE REVISED CITY 

21:50:48 COUNCIL HANDBOOK OF RULES AND 
PROCEDURES.

21:50:54 AND I DON'T KNOW IF THERE IS ANY 
PRESENTATION, DEBRA ON THIS OR 

21:51:00 IS THIS JUST --
>> Ms. Margolis:   JUST A BRIEF 

21:51:06 OVERVIEW FOR YOU.
THE CITY HANDBOOK OF RULES AND 

21:51:09 PROCEDURES HAS BEEN IN EXISTENCE 
IN THE CITY SINCE 1997.

21:51:14 THE HANDBOOK CONTAINS RULES AND 
PROCEDURES OF THE CONDUCT OF THE 

21:51:17 CITY COUNCIL AND ITS MEMBERS AS 
WELL AS THE CONDUCT OF THE 

21:51:20 MEETINGS THEMSELVES.
THE HANDBOOK INCLUDES RELEVANT 

21:51:24 PROCEDURES PRACTICES AND CUSTOMS 
AND HAS BEEN MAIMED PERIODICALLY 

21:51:30  AMENDED 
PERIODICALLY MOST RECENTLY IN 

21:51:34 2018 WHEN THE VICE MAYOR 
SELECTION RULES WERE UPDATED AND 

21:51:37 WHEN OTHER CHANGES WERE MADE TO 
THE RULES TO REFLECT THE 

21:51:40 CREATION OF DISTRICTS IN THE 
CITY AND THE NEW SEVEN MEMBER 

21:51:43 COUNCIL.
THE PURPOSE OF THE CURRENT 

21:51:45 AMENDMENT BEFORE YOU TONIGHT IS 
TO INCORPORATE THE NORMS AND 

21:51:51 PROTOCOLS THAT WERE DISCUSSED AT 
YOUR RETREAT IN JANUARY OF 2021.

21:51:54 AND THE DECISION WAS MADE AT 
THAT TIME THAT THEY SHOULD BE 

21:51:58 INCORPORATED INTO THE HANDBOOK 
ITSELF.

21:52:01 BECAUSE WE WERE DOING THAT WE 
ALSO LOOKED AT OTHER THINGS THAT 

21:52:05 MIGHT NEED TO BE AMENDED OR 
UPDATED AND WE HAVE INCLUDED A 

21:52:08 PROCEDURE FOR THE ISSUANCE OF 
CEREMONIAL PROCLAMATIONS AND 

21:52:12 RESOLUTIONS, CLARIFICATION OF 
THE SELECTION OF THE VICE MAYOR 

21:52:16 BY PUTTING IN AN EXAMPLE THAT 
KIND OF LAYS OUT HOW IT 

21:52:23 DEVELOPMENTALLY WORKS, BECAUSE 
THE WORDING OF IT IS A LITTLE 

21:52:26 CONARE VOLUTED AND COMPLICATED 
TO UNDERSTAND.

21:52:31 WE PUT IN A PROVISION REGARDING  
TOWN HALL MEETINGS AND COUNCIL 

21:52:36 REFERRALS AND WE MADE SOME OTHER 
MINOR NONSUBSTANTIVE CHANGES.

21:52:41 SO WITH THAT, YOU HAVE THE 
AMENDMENT BEFORE I WITH THE 

21:52:44 PROPOSED LANGUAGE AND I'M 
AVAILABLE FOR ANY QUESTIONS THAT 

21:52:52 YOU MAY HAVE.
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU, IS 

21:52:56 THERE A CLARIFYING QUESTION?
AND I SEE ALSO WE HAVE A PUBLIC 

21:52:58 SPEAKER.
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN.

21:53:02 >> Councilmember Kassan:   YES, 
I NOTICED SOMETHING THAT'S COME 

21:53:11 UP BEFORE.
SO IN CHAPTER 2B, 5, WHEN 

21:53:16 FOREIGN DIGNITARIES REQUEST 
OFFICIAL CITY OF FREMONT EVENTS 

21:53:20 WITH MEMBERS, I HAD HEARD 
SOMETHING HOW THAT MIGHT HAVE 

21:53:24 BEEN EXPANDED TO NOT JUST 
FOREIGN DIGNITARIES BUT DOMESTIC 

21:53:28 DIGNITARIES AS WELL SUCH AS LIKE 
THE GOVERNOR, THE LIEUTENANT 

21:53:31 GOVERNOR, THINGS LIKE THAT.
SO I JUST WANTED TO SEE IF THAT 

21:53:35 SHOULD BE EXPANDED TO MAYBE EVEN 
JUST DELETE DID WORD FOREIGN.

21:53:55  THE WORD FOREIGN.
>> Ms. Margolis:   IT IS UP TO 

21:53:59 THE COUNCIL IF YOU WANT TO 
CHANGE OR EXPAND THAT LANGUAGE 

21:54:04 WITH THE CONSENSUS OF THE ENTIRE 
COUNCIL.

21:54:06 >> Councilmember Kassan:   YES, 
I BELIEVE THERE WAS A RECENT 

21:54:10 EVENT WHERE WE HAD SOME 
NONFOREIGN DIGNITARIES THAT 

21:54:12 MAYBE THE OTHER COUNCILMEMBERS 
WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE BEEN 

21:54:15 INCLUDED IN.
SO I JUST WANTED TO BRING THAT 

21:54:18 UP AND SEE WHAT OTHER 
COUNCILMEMBERS THINK ABOUT THAT, 

21:54:27 THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: COUNCILMEMBER 

21:54:28 KENG.
>> Councilmember Keng:   MADAM 

21:54:32 MAYOR, I BELIEVE THAT DURING THE 
JANUARY COUNCIL RETREAT WE DID 

21:54:38 TALK ABOUT INCLUDING THE 
DOMESTIC DIGNITARY SUCH AS 

21:54:44 GOVERNORS OR CONGRESS MEMBER.
AND VISIT TO OPEN UP THE 

21:54:49 INVITATION TO THE WHOLE COUNCIL 
AND TO INCLUDE THAT TO THE 

21:54:53 COUNCIL HANDBOOK.
SO I DIDN'T SEE THAT IN THE 

21:54:56 REVISION.
SO JUST WANTED TO BRING THAT UP.

21:55:01 >> Mayor Mei:   COUNCILMEMBER 
JONES.

21:55:01 .
>> Councilmember Jones:   THANK 

21:55:04 YOU, MADAM MAYOR.
I JUST HAVE TWO CLARIFYING 

21:55:07 QUESTIONS.
NUMBER 1 IF THE EVENT IS NOT 

21:55:10 SPONSORED BY THE CITY, IT'S 
SPONSORED BY A DIFFERENT AGENCY, 

21:55:13 THEY'RE THE ONES MAKING THE 
INVITATION INVITATIONS.

21:55:18 S.
IS THIS SAYING THAT IF THE MAYOR 

21:55:22 GETS INVITED TO SOMETHING BY THE 
IRVINGTON BUSINESS ASSOCIATION 

21:55:25 TO SPEAK AT A MEETING THAT THE 
REST OF THE COUNCIL IS GOING TO 

21:55:29 BE INVITED BECAUSE MAYBE AN 
ASSEMBLY MEMBER OR CONGRESSMAN 

21:55:35 WILL BE PRESENT, IS THAT THE 
LANGUAGE THAT WE'RE ADOPTING?

21:55:38 >> Ms. Margolis:   NO, THE LANK 
AS WRITTEN IS LIMITED TO EVENTS 

21:55:41 THAT ARE OFFICIAL CITY OF 
FREMONT EVENTS.

21:55:43 >> Councilmember Jones:   OKAY 
BECAUSE THE EVENT THAT WAS 

21:55:48 ALLUDED TO JUST A LITTLE BIT AGO 
WAS NOT A CITY OF FREMONT EVENT 

21:55:51 AND THE CITY OF FREMONT DID NOT 
CREATE THE INVITATION LIST.

21:55:55 MY FEAR IS THAT IF WE START 
HAVING VISITS FROM ASSEMBLY 

21:55:58 MEMBERS, CONGRESSMEN, GOVERNOR, 
WHOEVER AND THEY INVITE THE 

21:56:03 MAYOR OR A SPECIFIC PERSON TO 
JOIN THEM FOR AN EVENT OR LUNCH 

21:56:08 OR WHAT HAVE YOU ACKNOWLEDGE ARE 
WE OBLIGATED TO THEN TURN AROUND 

21:56:12 AND INVITE THE ENTIRE COUNCIL?
I DON'T THINK SO THAT THAT'S THE 

21:56:15 INTENT OF THE INVITATION AND I 
DON'T THINK THAT THOSE 

21:56:17 INVITATIONS WILL BE OFFERED IN 
THE FUTURE.

21:56:24 YOU KNOW THERE ARE SOME THINGS 
THAT -- DID YOU LOOK OON PAGE 1 

21:56:28 OF THE HANDBOOK THE MAYOR IS THE 
FIGURE HEAD OF THE CITY AND WILL 

21:56:31 REPRESENT THE CITY IN ALL 
CEREMONIAL ISSUES.

21:56:34 I DON'T THINK THAT IT'S 
NECESSARILY APPROPRIATE FOR THE 

21:56:41 ENTIRE COUNCIL TO BE INVITED TO 
AN EVENT THAT ONLY THE MAYOR WAS 

21:56:44 INVITED TO.
CERTAINLY THE COUNCIL CAN BE 

21:56:47 NOTIFIED BUT IT'S UP TO THE 
PERSON MAKING THE INVITATION TO 

21:56:50 EXTEND THAT INVITATION OR TO 
APPROVE THAT INVITATION TO 

21:56:59 INCLUDE THE REST OF THE COUNCIL.
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

21:57:01 COUNCILMEMBER COX.
>> Councilmember Cox:   YES, DID 

21:57:09 , I 
DID WANT TO WEIGH IN ON THIS 

21:57:11 ONE.
THE SITUATION WAS ATHE PERSON 

21:57:15 WAS A PAST INTERNATIONAL 
DIGNITARY IN ADDITION TO A 

21:57:19 DOMESTIC CURRENT DIGNITARY.
AND SO I WANTED TO SEE IF 

21:57:24 THERE'S SOME WAY OF -- IT 
DOESN'T MATTER IF IT'S DOMESTIC 

21:57:28 OR FOREIGN.
THEY'RE A DIGNITARY.

21:57:33  THAT, IF 
THEY'RE USING THE CITY OF 

21:57:39 FREMONT'S OFFICES, OR HAVING AN 
OFFICIAL CITY OF FREMONT EVENT, 

21:57:44 THAT'S WHAT I RECALL WAS PART OF 
THE REASON WHY WE HAD PUT IN THE 

21:57:55 WORDING TO THAT EFFECT.
THAT ALL OF THE CITY COUNCIL 

21:57:57 MEMBERS WOULD BE EXTENDED A 
COURTESY INVITATION.

21:58:04 I JUST WANTED TO ADD THAT ASPECT 
TO THE DEFINITION IN THAT 

21:58:09 REGARDS FOR THAT SECTION B OF 
THE EXTENDED PROTOCOLS FOR CITY 

21:58:12 COUNCIL MEMBERS WHEN IT'S 
INVOLVING DIGNITARIES.

21:58:15 SINCE WE'RE JUST TALKING ABOUT 
THAT ONE TOPIC.

21:58:19 SO I JUST WANTED TO WEIGH IN ON 
THAT ONE.

21:58:26 >> Mayor Mei:   SURE.
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN.

21:58:31 CONDITIONS I'M SUGGESTING THE 
REMOVAL OF ONE WORD, FOREIGN, I 

21:58:36 DON'T KNOW WHY WE WOULD TREAT 
FOREIGN DIGNITARIES DIFFERENT 

21:58:40 THAN DOMESTIC DIGNITARIES.
SO I DON'T THINK IT WOULD BE 

21:58:46   
SUPERCONTROVERSIAL.

21:58:47 IS.
>> Mayor Mei:   I'M GOING TO 

21:58:51 WEIGH IN.
HAVING SERVED ON SEVERAL OTHER 

21:58:55 MAYORS ORGANIZATIONS, I CAN 
UNDERSTAND IF THERE IS A MEETING 

21:58:58 ON CITY PROPERTY WITH A CITY RUN 
EVENT THAT'S SOMETHING WE WOULD 

21:59:02 LOOK AT BUT I'M OFTEN EXTENDED 
INVITATIONS THAT PERTAIN 

21:59:06 SPECIFICALLY TO ME, AND MY ROLE 
AS THE MAYOR.

21:59:10 AND THOSE ARE USUALLY NOT 
TRANSFERABLE AND I CAN'T EVEN 

21:59:12 SEND A REPLACEMENT ALTERNATE TO 
THOSE.

21:59:16 AND SO IN THOSE SITUATIONS I 
WOULD FIND IT INAPPROPRIATE AND 

21:59:19 I'VE ALSO LOOKED AT OTHER CITIES 
AND SOME OF THEIR GUIDELINES AND 

21:59:24 SPOKEN WITH MY -- SOME OF MY 
FELLOW COLLEAGUES AND THAT JUST 

21:59:28 DOES NOT SEEM TO BE THE 
PROCEDURES THAT OTHER CITIES ARE 

21:59:40 FOLLOWING.
THEY'RE DELINEATIONS, I'M A 

21:59:45 MEMBER OF THE COUNCIL, ONE OF 
THOSE CLARIFICATIONS IS TO SERVE 

21:59:48 AS A REPRESENTATIVE AND I 
WOULDN'T BE INTERESTED IN MAKING 

21:59:49 THAT CHANGE.
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN.

21:59:57 >> Councilmember Salwan:   THANK 
YOU, MADAM MAYOR.

22:00:00 I THINK WHEN WE HAD A GOOD 
DISCUSSION IN THE JANUARY 

22:00:05 RETREAT ABOUT THIS, I THINK I 
WOULD AGREE THAT IF IT'S WITHIN 

22:00:11 THE CITY HALL OR CITY BUILDING, 
I THINK WE NEED TO BE MORE OPEN, 

22:00:15 AND ALLOW ACCESS TO FELLOW 
COLLEAGUES.

22:00:18 BUT AT THE SAME TIME, WE DO HAVE 
A DIRECTLY ELECTED MAYOR WHO'S 

22:00:22 ELECTED BY THE PEOPLE TO 
REPRESENT OUR CITY.

22:00:26 AND WE DON'T WANT TO BE TOO 
PRESCRIPTIVE SO THE MAYOR CAN'T 

22:00:29 HAVE ANY MEETINGS AT THE CITY 
HALL.

22:00:32 SO I THINK WE HAVE TO ALLOW SOME 
FLEXIBILITY BUT TRY TO 

22:00:36 ACCOMPLISH THE INTENT OF 
ALLOWING FOLKS TO BE ABLE TO 

22:00:41 COME.
OTHERWISE WE'RE ALWAYS GOING TO 

22:00:45 BE CHECKING OKAY WITH THIS EVENT 
WHO IS RESPONSIBLE WHO IS COMING 

22:00:50 YOU KNOW WHO'S HOSTING.
IS THIS A FOREIGN DIGNITARY.

22:00:53 IT'S LIKE A WHOLE CHECKLIST.
WHAT WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO DID 

22:00:57 IS TO WORK WELL TOGETHER AND TO 
BUILD THAT TRUST OVER TIME 

22:01:00 RATHER THAN BE FREE SCRIPTIVE 
AND HAVE ALL THESE CHECKLISTS 

22:01:04 THAT WE HAVE GOT TO FILL OUT.
SO I DO THINK WE NEED TO ALLOW 

22:01:09 THE MAYOR, FREEDOM TO BE ABLE TO 
MEET WITH STATE OFFICIALS, 

22:01:13 LEGISLATORS, BECAUSE SOMETIMES, 
YOU KNOW, SOME DIFFICULT 

22:01:15 DISCUSSIONS NEED TO BE HAD IN 
PRIVATE.

22:01:18 NOT EVERYBODY CAN BE THERE WHEN 
YOU'RE TRYING TO GET CAN FUNDING 

22:01:22 FOR CERTAIN PROGRAMS OR TRYING 
TO MAKE A PITCH FOR SOMETHING.

22:01:38 SO I THINK THAT STAFF AND STRURK 
A GOOD BALANCE AND I'M OKAY WITH 

22:01:58 THAT.


22:01:58 


22:03:12 


22:03:13 


22:03:13 


22:03:44 


22:03:44 


22:03:44 


22:03:51 
>> Councilmember Jones: SO AS A PERSON 
22:03:56 ON A MULTICITY TOUR, MAKING STOPS, AND WE'VE HAD THIS HAPPEN TWICE IN THE 
22:03:59 LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS, SOMEONE HAS COME THROUGH TO PROMOTE THE BILLS THAT THEY 
22:04:06 HAVE PUT FORWARD AND A COUPLE OF THOSE HAVE BENEFITED OUR CITY, IS THAT 
22:04:09 SOMETHING NOT NECESSARILY A CEREMONIAL THING, BUT IN SOME CASES, IT'S MERELY 
22:04:14 A PHOTO OP.  SO IS THAT SOMETHING THAT IS GOING TO BE FALLING UNDER THIS 
22:04:18 GUIDELINE?  THAT EVERY TIME SOMEBODY REQUESTS A PHOTO OP WITH THE MAYOR OR 
22:04:23 ANOTHER COUNCILMEMBER, THAT WE HAVE TO EXTEND AN INVITATION TO THE REST OF 
22:04:28 COUNCIL?  JUST BECAUSE THEY WANT A PHOTO IN THE COUNCIL CHAIM BIRS IN 
22:04:36  CHAMBERS IN FRONT OF THE CITY SEAL?  I THINK IT BECOMES PROBLEMATIC.  TO ME 
22:04:39 IT COMES DOWN TO THE PERSON DOING THE INVITING IS THE ONE WHO GETS TO CHOOSE 
22:04:46 THEIR GUEST.  IF I'M INVITED TO AN EVENT, YOU KNOW, PERSONAL OR BUSINESS 
22:04:50 RELATED, IF I GO TO A FAMILY PARTY, I'M NOT GOING TO INVITE ALL OF MY FRIENDS 
22:04:54 TO COME WITH ME WITHOUT CHECKING WITH THE HOST FIRST.  SO I THINK THAT'S 
22:04:59 WHERE IT BECOMES PROBLEMATIC, AND THAT THE INVITATION WAS EXTENDED TO A 
22:05:04 SPECIFIC PERSON, YES, THE REST OF THE COUNCIL, MAYBE WE SHOULD BE NOTIFIED, 
22:05:09 BUT IT'S UP TO THE PERSON MAKING THE INVITATION TO INVITE ANYONE ELSE OR TO 
22:05:18 SAY YEA OR NAY TO THE REST OF THE COUNCIL ATTENDING.

22:05:20 >> Mayor Mei: COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN, COUNCILMEMBER SHAO.  SUSAN, DO YOU 
22:05:29 HAVE SOMETHING  TO -- ARE WE DUE FOR A BREAK?  SORRY, YOU'RE ON MUTE, SUSAN.

22:05:33 >> Ms. Gauthier: I APOLOGIZE.  I HOPE YOU CAN HEAR ME NOW.  JUST TO 
22:05:38 COUNCILMEMBER JONES' POINT, I HAVE A QUESTION REALLY THAT GOES TO DEBRA 
22:05:45 MARGOLIS, IS, IS THIS A BROWN ACT -- WOULD WE HAVE TO POST SPECIAL MEETING 
22:05:51 NOTICES FOR ALL OF THESE EVENTS THAT THE ENTIRE COUNCIL IS INVOLVED IN, AND 
22:05:58 THAT CREATES A LOT OF ADDITIONAL CITY CLERK OFFICE TIME TO PREPARE, POST THE 
22:06:03  NOTICES, GET THEM POSTED OUT IN FRONT OF THE VARIOUS BUILDINGS, EVEN IF IT'S 
22:06:07 NOT AT CITY HALL, MAYBE IT'S AT THE WARM SPRINGS COMMUNITY CENTER AND 
22:06:12 WE'RE REQUIRED TO THEN POST A NOTICE THERE.

22:06:14 >> Ms. Margolis: YEAH, THAT'S THE POINT THAT COUNCILMEMBER SHAO WAS RAISING 
22:06:20 ALSO, I  BELIEVE, AND THE CONFUSION THERE IS THE BROWN ACT HAS SEVERAL 
22:06:25 EXEMPTIONS, ONE OF WHICH IS AN EXEMPTION FOR CEREMONIAL MEETINGS, SO 
22:06:31 IT REALLY KIND OF DEPENDS ON THE PURPOSE OF THE MEETING.  IF IT'S SOME 
22:06:35 KIND OF A GATHERING WHERE THERE'S GOING TO BE A DISCUSSION OF CITY BUSINESS IN 
22:06:39 ANY WAY, THEN YES, IT WOULD BE A MEETING AND IT WOULD HAVE TO BE 
22:06:44 NOTICED AND THE PUBLIC WOULD HAVE TO BE ALLOWED TO ATTEND AND ALL THAT.  
22:06:49 WHEREAS IF IT'S SIMPLY MORE OF A CEREMONIAL TYPE MEETING, THEN THAT 
22:06:56 WOULD NOT BE REQUIRED.  SO IT'S ANOTHER COMPLICATION OF THIS POLICY, IS THAT 
22:07:04 WE WOULD HAVE TO ANALYZE THAT FOR EACH SEPARATE MEETING OR GATHERING, AND FOR 
22:07:13 EXAMPLE, THE ONES RECENTLY WHERE WE HAD LEGISLATORS COME BY LOOKING AT THE 
22:07:16 PROJECTS THEY'RE PROMOTING, WE HAD TO KIND OF THINK THROUGH, WELL, IS THAT 
22:07:19 SOMETHING WHERE THE COUNCIL IS GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT CITY BUSINESS, ARE 
22:07:24 THEY ADVOCATING FOR THOSE PROJECTS TO BE  INCLUDED OR IS IT LITERALLY JUST A 
22:07:32 PHOTO OP?  SO THERE IS, YOU KNOW, AN ANALYSIS THAT GOES INTO EACH ONE OF 
22:07:34 THESE ITEMS.
>> Mayor Mei: SO JUST REAL  QUICK, 
22:07:38 BECAUSE I SEE THAT THERE IS A HAND RAISED, I APOLOGIZE, I'M GOING TO 
22:07:42 QUICKLY -- I SEE ONE HAND RAISED FOR PUBLIC COMMENT AND SO I DON'T THINK 
22:07:45 I'VE ASKED FOR THAT AND I  JUST -- ACTUALLY TWO, SO WE'RE GOING TO CALL 
22:07:49 THE PUBLIC  SPEAKERS REAL QUICK AND THEN COME BACK TO THE COUNCIL BECAUSE 
22:07:56 I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE PERHAPS A LENGTHIER CONVERSATION STILL.  CHRIS, 
22:08:00 IF YOU'D LIKE TO UNMUTE THE MIC, PLEASE.

22:08:09 >>  THANK YOU.  THIS SEEMED TO GO WAY OFF TOPIC AND I'LL REMIND THE CITY 
22:08:15 THAT THEY WERE SUED IN 2006 FOR VIOLATIONS OF THE BROWN ACT BY DENNIS 
22:08:21 WOEFEL SO THEY SHOULD THINK BEFORE THEY START TO MAKE CHANGES AROUND THE BROWN 
22:08:29 ACT.  MY COMMENTS AROUND THESE THINGS ARE, I WAS SURPRISED THAT THE WRITTEN 
22:08:36 COMMUNICATIONS WERE LIMITED BY TIME, THAT DOESN'T SEEM TO MAKE LOGICAL 
22:08:44 SENSE SINCE THEY WOULD BE SUBMITTED, BUT YOU HAVE SAID THAT.  IT ALSO 
22:08:51 CLEARLY STATES THAT THE CITIZENS ARE ALLOWED TO ASK QUESTIONS, BUT THERE'S 
22:08:57 NO -- YOU STILL HAVEN'T PUT ANYTHING THERE OF THE CITY COUNCIL'S ACTUALLY 
22:09:02 GOING TO ADDRESS QUESTIONS ASKED BY THE PUBLIC.  ADDITIONALLY, THERE'S NOTHING 
22:09:10 IN THERE, THE RIGHT OF THE PUBLIC TO PRESENT ANYTHING.  I'VE ALSO FOUND IT 
22:09:14 TROUBLING DURING THE TIMES DURING COVID THAT WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO PRESENT 
22:09:21 ANYTHING.  AND I THINK YOU GUYS SHOULD LOOK AT IT AS COVID IS THE NEW REALITY 
22:09:25 AND COMMUNICATIONS MAY HAPPEN OVER ZOOM ALL THE TIME AND LOOK AT YOUR RULES IN 
22:09:30 THAT ASPECT, NOT IN THE IN PUBLIC PERSON THING.  THANK YOU.

22:09:38 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.  KELLY?
>>  SO WHEN SOMEBODY SAYS, O IT'S JUST 
22:09:42 A PHOTO OP, I'VE SEEN A PHOTO OP IN THE LAST COUPLE YEARS WHERE FIVE 
22:09:49 POLITICIANS WERE LINED UP BEHIND SHOVELS AND IT WASN'T A SHOVEL-READY 
22:09:55  PROJECT, AND IT'S STILL AN EMPTY LOT THERE.  AT THAT PLACE THAT THEY WERE 
22:10:00 STANDING.  IT'S NICE TO HAVE THESE RULES BECAUSE YOU CAN READ IN THE 
22:10:04 NEWSPAPER, YOU'LL SEE THAT NEIGHBORING CITY COUNCILS LITERALLY CLOSE BY 
22:10:09 FREMONT, THERE'S INTERESTING WARFARE GOING ON OVER THERE BECAUSE THEY CAN'T 
22:10:14 GET ALONG ON THE CITY COUNCIL FOR SOME REASON OR OTHER.  ON PAGE 5 OF THIS 
22:10:19 THING, IT TALKS ABOUT REFERRALS.  BUT IF A REFERRAL HASN'T ANY TIMELINE, 
22:10:26 THEN REALLY WHAT YOU ARE DOING IS DOING A SUBTERFUGE, A POLICY DIRECTOR OR 
22:10:32 COUNCIL GUIDANCE REFERRALS SHOULD BE -- SHOULD HAVE SOME TIMELINE FOR 
22:10:36 RESPONSIVE ACTION, AND THEN BE AGENDIZED AS A SEPARATE ITEM FOR 
22:10:43 COUNCIL APPROVAL.  REFERRALS SHOULD NOT CREATE OR IMPLEMENT POLICY AND 
22:10:46 REFERRALS SHOULD NOT BE LEFT OUT HANGING.  YOU NEED TO CREATE CLEAR 
22:10:51 REFERRALS, AND HAVING THE CITY MANAGER SIT THERE AND SAY THAT STAFF 
22:10:55 UNDERSTANDS A REFERRAL IS NO ASSURANCE THAT ANYTHING IS GOING TO HAPPEN WITH 
22:11:02 A REFERRAL.  AND TOWN HALL MEETINGS REQUIRE USE OF CITY RESOURCES FOR 
22:11:06 SCHEDULING AND RECORDING, WHAT ABOUT COMMUNITY MEETINGS?  WHY DON'T YOU 
22:11:10 RECORD COMMUNITY MEETINGS ON ZOOM?  COMMUNITY MEETINGS HAVE TO BE 
22:11:16 RECORDED.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.  NOW WE'LL 
22:11:19 TURN IT BACK TO OUR COUNCIL FOR CONVERSATION ON THIS PROPOSED 
22:11:26 AMENDMENTS.  VICE MAYOR SHAO.
>> Vice Mayor Shao: DON'T TAKE MY JOKE 
22:11:32 IN THE WRONG WAY.  I'M JUST THINKING MAYBE WE SHOULD HAVE SOME PAPERCUTS OF 
22:11:38 EACH ONE OF US -- THE CITY HALL AND IF THERE'S A PHOTO OP, WE CAN JUST PUT 
22:11:43 OUT THOSE PAPER CUT AND TAKE A GROUP PICTURE AS IF WE WERE ALL THERE, 
22:11:48 BECAUSE I FIND THAT MOST OF THOSE CEREMONIAL ONES, YOU KNOW, WE DON'T 
22:11:55 HAVE TO BE THERE.
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY.  THANK YOU.  
22:12:00 COUNCILMEMBER KENG?
>>  THANK YOU, MAYOR MEI.  SO I DO 
22:12:11 HAVE A QUESTION TO DEBRA, CITY ATTORNEY.  SO I DO GENERALLY AGREE, IF 
22:12:27 IT'S A  CITY-HOSTED MEETING, ALL SHOULD BE NOTIFIED, BUT ALSO IF IT'S AT THE 
22:12:36 CITY CHAMBER -- CITY  OFFICES, I THINK, YOU KNOW, FOR THE -- FOR EXAMPLE, 
22:12:41 YEAH, SO ALSO, I'M WONDERING, BECAUSE SO FOR EXAMPLE, I SAW -- I THINK IT 
22:12:49 WAS LAST MONTH, THE GOVERNOR VISITED UNION CITY AT A HEALTH CLINIC TO SHOW 
22:12:55 -- TO SEE VACCINATION PROGRESS AND STUFF LIKE THAT, AND IT WASN'T AT THE 
22:13:00 CITY HALL, BUT I BELIEVE, YOU KNOW, THE INVITATION WENT OUT TO ALL CITY 
22:13:06 COUNCILMEMBERS.  SO KIND OF LIKE THAT, MAYBE THE CITY ALSO WASN'T THE HOST, 
22:13:16 BUT I THINK IF THE CITY OFFICE WERE AWARE OF THE EVENT, IT IS GOOD FOR THE 
22:13:23 INVITATION TO BE SENT OUT TO THE COUNCILMEMBERS.  SO THAT'S AN EXAMPLE 
22:13:31 OF IF NEITHER THE HOST OR THE EVENT TOOK PLACE AT THE CITY OFFICE OR 
22:13:38 CHAMBER, BUT INVITATIONS WENT OUT TO THE CITY COUNCIL.  SO I THINK IT  IS 
22:13:45 -- I THINK IF THE -- EVEN IF THE CITY -- IF THE CITY WAS AWARE OF THE EVENT 
22:13:51 AND IF WE HAVE FOREIGN OR DOMESTIC DIGNITARIES THAT CAME THROUGH, I WOULD 
22:13:59 SUPPORT THAT THE COUNCILMEMBERS ARE INVITED.

22:14:01 >> Mayor Mei: OKAY.
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN.

22:14:05 >> Councilmember Salwan: YEAH, I THINK THAT WE HAVE A GOOD POLICY THAT'S 
22:14:10 WORKING.
WE HAD A FEW EVENTS RECENTLY WHERE WE 
22:14:14 HAD SENATOR WIECKOWSKI COME TO TOWN AND STAFF INVITED EVERYBODY, AND WE HAD 
22:14:21 ANOTHER ONE, WHO WAS THE OTHER ONE?
OH, CONGRESSMAN RO KHANNA, AND THEN WE 
22:14:24 HAD CONGRESSMAN  SWALWELL, SO IT WORKED FINE.

22:14:27 I THINK IT'S WORKING BETTER.
I THINK THE INTENT OR THE ORIGINAL 
22:14:31 CONCERN IS BEING ADDRESSED, AND I THINK WE DON'T WANT TO PUT HANDCUFFS ON THE 
22:14:35 MAYOR.
I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE SOME LEEWAY 
22:14:38 FOR THE MAYOR TO HAVE SOME MEETINGS, BUT IF THERE ARE ANY OFFICIAL MEETINGS 
22:14:46 IN THE CITY HALL, BY ALL MEANS, WE SHOULD TRY TO OPEN THEM UP TO EVERYONE 
22:14:51 BUT GIVE THE MAYOR SOME PREROGATIVE TO HAVE SOME ONE ON ONE MEETINGS AS 
22:14:53 WELL.
IF WE HAD TO DISCLOSE EVERY SINGLE 
22:14:58 MEETING WE HAD WITH DIFFERENT DIGNITARIES, DO I HAVE TO DISCLOSE I 
22:15:02 MET WITH RO KHANNA AT THE CITY ALL OR IF WE TALKED TO ERIK SWALWELL OR THE 
22:15:07   GOVERNOR, I SPOKE TO THE GOVERNOR.
SO IT JUST BECOMES CUMBERSOME TO TRY 
22:15:10 TO REGULATE, TO TRY TO MICROMANAGE THESE THINGS.

22:15:14 WHAT WE REALLY WANT IS TO HAVE THE INTENT OF BEING OPEN, BUILDING TRUST 
22:15:18 AND BEING MORE TRANSPARENT, AND ALLOW SOME LEEWAY FOR SOME OF THESE THINGS 
22:15:22 TO -- SOME INDIVIDUAL PREROGATIVE.
I THINK THE CITY STAFF AND I'M SURE 
22:15:26 THE CITY MANAGER CAN SPEAK TO THAT, BUT HE WILL DEFINITELY TRY TO MAKE SURE 
22:15:31 THAT EVERYBODY HEARS ABOUT IT.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

22:15:33 COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN.
>> Councilmember Kassan: JUST ON A 
22:15:37  TOTALLY DIFFERENT TOPIC, CHRIS, ONE OF THE SPEAKERS MADE A REALLY GOOD POINT, 
22:15:41 I THOUGHT.
ON PAGE 12, IT SAYS ORAL AND WRITTEN 
22:15:43 COMMUNICATIONS, INDIVIDUALS SPEAKERS, 3 MINUTES.

22:15:48 THAT DOES SEEM KIND OF WEIRD.
IT SEEMS LIKE MAYBE THE WORDS  "AND 
22:15:51 WRITTEN" SHOULDN'T BE THERE.
I DIDN'T NOTICE THAT BEFORE.

22:15:58 SO DOES THE CITY ATTORNEY HAVE A COMMENT AS TO WHY IT SAYS 3 MINUTES 
22:16:05 FOR ORAL AND WRITTEN COMMUNICATIONS?
>> Ms. Margolis: NO.

22:16:08 [LAUGHTER]
>> Councilmember Kassan: OKAY.

22:16:12 >> Ms. Margolis: POINT WELL TAKEN.
WE'LL FIX THAT.

22:16:16 >> Councilmember Kassan: AND THANKS TO CHRIS FOR BEING A VERY GOOD -- CAREFUL 
22:16:20 READER OF DOCUMENTS.
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY.

22:16:23 SEEING NONE, CAN I GET OTHER COMMENTS AT THIS TIME, CAN I GET A MOTION, 
22:16:29 PLEASE?
MOTION BY COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN, 
22:16:33 SECONDED BY JONES OR -- JONES, I THINK YOU PRESSED FIRST.

22:16:38 OH, COUNCILMEMBER -- OKAY.
COUNCILMEMBER COX, DID YOU HAVE 
22:16:41 ANOTHER COMMENT?
>> Councilmember Cox: SO I GUESS I'M 
22:16:45 CONFUSED.
WHAT ARE WE VOTING ON RIGHT NOW 
22:16:50 BECAUSE THERE WERE SOME OTHER COMMENTS THAT I HADN'T GOT A CHANCE TO ASK FOR 
22:16:52 THE HANDBOOK.
I KNOW WE WERE TALKING ABOUT ONE 
22:16:58 PARTICULAR AREA, BUT THERE MIGHT BE SOME OTHER ITEMS, AT LEAST I WAS GOING 
22:17:04 TO BRING UP TO KIND OF UNDERSTAND -- GET SOME CLARIFICATION.

22:17:11 SO I WAS JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND, I KNOW YOU'RE TRYING TO TAKE A VOTE, BUT 
22:17:16 I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT IS THE LANGUAGE THAT WE'RE ACCEPTING, AND WHAT WERE 
22:17:20 SOME OF THE CHANGES BECAUSE I THOUGHT WE WERE STILL IN DIALOGUE.

22:17:24 >> Mayor Mei: WELL, COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN, WOULD YOU LIKE TO MAKE YOUR 
22:17:28 MOTION AND EXPRESS IN DETAIL WHAT IT IS THAT YOU'RE APPROVING?

22:17:33 >> Councilmember Salwan: WELL, MY MOTION WAS GOING TO BE TO ACCEPT 
22:17:37 COUNCIL HANDBOOK AS PRESENTED.
BUT IF COUNCILMEMBER COX HAS SOME 
22:17:40 OTHER COMMENTS --
>> Mayor Mei: IF YOU'D LIKE TO MAKE 
22:17:45 ANY FRIENDLY AMENDMENTS  OR --
>> Councilmember Cox: I THINK IN THAT 
22:17:51 CASE FOR THE FRIENDLY AMENDMENT WOULD BE TO REMOVE THE WORD "FOREIGN" AND 
22:17:59 JUST HAVE" DIGNITARY "FOR B5.
THAT'S IN THE HANDBOOK.

22:18:06 THE OTHER PART WAS TO  UNDERSTAND -- I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY WE WERE JUST, I 
22:18:11 GUESS, LIMITED TO ONE TOWN HALL, I THOUGHT IT WAS TWO TOWN HALLS LAST 
22:18:16 YEAR, AND HAS IT ALWAYS BEEN ONE?
>> Mayor Mei: IT HASN'T BEEN A PAST 
22:18:20 PRACTICE FOR COUNCILMEMBERS TO ACTUALLY DO TOWN HALLS IN THE PAST, SO WE 
22:18:26 STARTED IT BECAUSE OUR COUNCIL HAS EXPANDED IN SIZE, WE HAVE LIMITED TO 
22:18:29 ONE TOWN HALL BECAUSE WE HAVE SEVEN COUNCILMEMBERS.

22:18:35 AND SO THAT WAS TO ENSURE THAT STAFF WOULD HAVE AMPLE TIME TO PLAN AND 
22:18:39 PREPARE FOR THOSE, AND SO THAT WAS THE PROPOSAL FROM STAFF IN CONJUNCTION 
22:18:42 WITH THE COUNCIL.
>> Councilmember Cox: OH, OKAY.

22:18:45 GOTCHA.
BECAUSE I DID SEE THE OTHER PART THAT 
22:18:49 YOU CAN'T HAVE TOWN -- YOU CAN HAVE OTHER TOWN HALL MEETINGS BUT NOT WITH 
22:18:52 THE SUPPORT OF THE STAFF.
>> Mayor Mei: YES.

22:18:53 >> Councilmember Cox: I THINK I READ AS WELL.

22:18:56 OKAY.
>> City Manager Danaj: THAT'S CORRECT, 
22:18:58 COUNCILMEMBER.
I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR, YOU OBVIOUSLY 
22:19:02 CAN HOLD YOUR OWN MEETINGS AS MANY TIMES AS YOU WANT, BUT IN TERMS OF 
22:19:05 SORT OF A DEDICATED STAFF PRESENCE --
>> Mayor Mei: OR RESOURCES.

22:19:08 >> City Manager Danaj:DEPARTMEN T HEADS OR PLANNING FOR IT OR RESOURCING IT, 
22:19:10 THAT'S THE PROPOSAL.
>> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.

22:19:19 GOTCHA.
>> Mayor Mei: ARE THERE ANY --

22:19:21 >> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.
>> Mayor Mei: COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN, DO 
22:19:25 YOU ACCEPT OR WANT TO COMMENT -- I MIGHT MAKE SOME COMMENTS TOO.

22:19:29 >> Councilmember Salwan: SINCE WE HAVE TO GET FOUR VOTES, I WOULD WELCOME THE 
22:19:32 FEEDBACK FROM ALL OF YOU, IF THAT'S SUFFICIENT TO PASS THE MOTION.

22:19:37 IF YOU CAN WEIGH IN ON DIGNITARY VERSUS FOREIGN DIGNITARY.

22:19:40 >> Mayor Mei: I THINK WHEN WE START GOING INTO DIGNITARIES, I DO HAVE A 
22:19:42 LOT OF MEETINGS.
I SIT ON A LOT OF COMMITTEES AND 
22:19:45 BOARDS FOR U.S. CONFERENCE OF MAYORS, NATIONAL LEAGUE OF  CITIES AND I DO 
22:19:52 MEET WITH FELLOW MAYORS, I DO MEET WITH FELLOW LOCAL LEGISLATORS OFTEN, AND I 
22:19:57 DON'T KNOW FOR COMMITTEES OR FOR LOBBYING, BECAUSE I ALSO WORK ON OUR 
22:20:05 LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES AND I'M NOT SURE IF I TALK THEM THAT I BRING THE ENTIRE 
22:20:08 COUNCIL IN EVERY TIME, THAT WOULD BE VERY RESTRICTIVE AND CONSTRICTIVE, I 
22:20:10 THINK.
I THINK THAT WE UNDERSTAND THE SPIRIT 
22:20:15 OF WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.
IF THEY'RE CEREMONIAL ITEMS OR BIG 
22:20:18 CONVERSATIONS OR SOME SORT OF PRESS CONFERENCE, I MEAN, DEFINITELY I CAN 
22:20:23 UNDERSTAND, BUT INDIVIDUALLY AS A MAYOR, I DO MEET REGULARLY WITH MANY 
22:20:27 PEOPLE IN DIFFERENT CAPACITIES AND BRINGING EVERYONE IN WOULD BE A LITTLE 
22:20:30 UNTRADITIONAL AND UNORTHODOX COMPARED TO OTHER CITIES.

22:20:32 ESPECIALLY FOR A DIRECTLY ELECTED MAYOR.

22:20:38 COUNCILMEMBER SHAO?
>> Vice Mayor Shao: I WOULD KEEP AS 
22:20:44 IS, KEEP THE FOREIGN, BECAUSE YOU KNOW, JUST USE THE  GOVERNOR'S VISIT TO 
22:20:47 UNION CITY.
IF I WERE THE GOVERNOR, I'D RATHER BE 
22:20:53 SURROUNDED BY PEOPLE, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE, NOT ALL THE LOCAL OFFICIALS, YOU KNOW, 
22:20:56  JUST -- THEY FEEL LIKE THEY HAD TO BE THERE.

22:21:02 I WANT TO INTERACT DIRECTLY WITH THE VOTERS RATHER THAN JUST, YOU KNOW, 
22:21:08 THOSE OFFICIALS.
SO JUST THINK IN THE SHOES OF THOSE 
22:21:17 DIGNITARIES.
>> Councilmember Salwan: ANYONE ELSE?

22:21:22 COUNCILMEMBER JONES?
>> Councilmember Jones: I AGREE.

22:21:28 I THINK THAT IF WE OPEN THE DOOR TO, YOU KNOW, SOMETHING OTHER THAN FOREIGN 
22:21:31 DIGNITARIES, NUMBER ONE, WHO DETERMINES WHO'S A DIGNITARY?

22:21:37 SO IT COULD APPLY TO A NUMBER OF THINGS.

22:21:41 BUT THE MAJORITY OF US HAVE THE ABILITY TO MEET WITH LEGISLATORS THROUGHOUT 
22:21:45 THE STATE ON OUR OWN PREROGATIVES, AND IT'S NOT NECESSARY FOR ALL OF US TO BE 
22:21:50 AT AN EVENT WHEN A PARTICULAR PERSON CALLS FOR A MEETING WITH THE MAYOR.

22:21:55 WE'D BE DOWN THERE ALL THE TIME.
AND I REALLY DON'T THINK IT'S 
22:21:58 APPROPRIATE THAT WE KIND OF INVITE OURSELVES ALONG TO ALL OF THOSE 
22:22:01 EVENTS.
SO I'M FINE WITH LEAVING IT AT FOREIGN 
22:22:04 DIGNITARY.
>> Mayor Mei: COUNCILMEMBER  KENG?

22:22:10 >> Councilmember Keng: I DO SUPPORT WHEN THERE'S CEREMONIAL EVENTS LIKE 
22:22:20 THE VISITS IN THE -- CONGRESSMAN SWALWELL, CONGRESSMAN RO KHANNA, WE 
22:22:25 WERE ALL NOTIFIED, SO I THINK IT'S GOOD THAT, YOU KNOW, WE MEET THEM WHEN 
22:22:31 THEY'RE COMING TO THOSE OFFICIAL VISITS, BUT I WOULD GIVE THE MAYOR THE 
22:22:41 ROOM TO MEET WITH OTHER ELECTS.
>> Councilmember Salwan: I THINK I 
22:22:45 UNDERSTAND WHERE EVERYBODY IS AT AND I KIND OF WANT TO GIVE THE MAYOR SOME 
22:22:48 LEEWAY, IT IS A DIRECTLY ELECTED MAYOR, SHE IS ELECTED BY THE PEOPLE, SHE IS 
22:22:51 REPRESENTING OUR CITY SO I DO THINK WE NEED TO GIVE SOME LEEWAY.

22:22:55 BUT I DO LIKE WHAT'S BEEN  HAPPENING RECENTLY, MORE INFORMATION, MORE 
22:22:58 DISCLOSURE, LETTING US KNOW ABOUT EVENTS, AND ACTUALLY WHEN PEOPLE HAVE 
22:23:03 BEEN MADE AWARE, NOT EVERYBODY SHOWS UP, YOU KNOW, SO IT'S AS YOU PICK AND 
22:23:05 CHOOSE.
SO AGAIN, WE JUST HAVE TO ALLOW SOME 
22:23:07 FLEXIBILITY.
I DON'T WANT TO BE TOO PRESCRIPTIVE.

22:23:11 SO I WILL JUST LEAVE IT AS IS.
I THINK THE MAYOR HAS VOICED HER 
22:23:14 OPINION AND I THINK WE SHOULD GIVE HER SOME BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT.

22:23:19 >> Mayor Mei: AND I  APPRECIATE --
>> City Manager Danaj: MARY JUST HAD 
22:23:22 SOMETHING WHEN YOU'RE READY.
>> Mayor Mei: I APPRECIATE SUSAN FOR 
22:23:26 BRINGING UP THAT PERSPECTIVE OF THE CLERK'S ROLE AND THE STAFF'S 
22:23:27 RESPONSIBILITIES SO I APPRECIATE THAT TOO.

22:23:30 >> Councilmember Salwan: WE DEFINITELY DON'T WANT TO ADD MORE BURDEN TO THE 
22:23:32 STAFF AND TRYING TO MICROMANAGE THESE THINGS.

22:23:34 I THINK THESE THINGS CAN GET VERY TRICKY.

22:23:39 AND I THINK IT'S UP TO EACH OF US TO TRY TO WORK ON THESE THINGS AND TRY TO 
22:23:43 COMMUNICATE MORE.
>> Councilmember Cox: OR COLLABORATE 
22:23:45 MORE, COLLABORATE WITH EVERYBODY TOGETHER.

22:23:49 I MEAN, I'M NOT SURE I MAKE MORE WORK FOR SUSAN AND THE STAFF AND FOR LILY 
22:23:53 TO BE ABLE TO HAVE SOME OF THE CONVERSATIONS THAT SHE CAN BE IN THE 
22:23:59 ROOM, BUT YOU  KNOW, SOMEONE THAT'S AT THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR OR GOVERNOR OR 
22:24:06 SO, WE NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THAT.
IN ALL FAIRNESS.

22:24:10 I KNOW WE SEE A LOT MORE OF OUR ASSEMBLYMEMBERS AND CONGRESS MEMBERS 
22:24:14 AS FREELY OR MORE FREQUENTLY, BUT SOMEONE OF HIGHER ABOVE THOSE, I WOULD 
22:24:23 PROBABLY WOULD KIND OF PUT IT IN THAT REALM IF I COULD DISTINGUISH BETWEEN 
22:24:25 THE TWO.
>> Councilmember Jones: BUT ONLY IF 
22:24:28 THAT'S A CITY EVENT, CORRECT?
>> Mayor Mei: I HAVE DINNERS WITH 
22:24:31 PEOPLE SOMETIMES PERMLY  TOO.
>> Councilmember Cox: WE DON'T WANT TO 
22:24:35 IMPOSE ON THAT FOR YOU, LILY, TO CONDUCT BUSINESS AND TO ENSURE FREMONT 
22:24:39 IS GOING TO CONTINUE THRIVING AND THOSE TYPE OF THINGS, YOU KNOW, BECAUSE IT'S 
22:24:40 NOT POSSIBLE THAT ALL OF US ARE GOING TO BE THERE ANYWAY.

22:24:48 THAT, YOU KNOW, WITH OUR SCHEDULE, BUT SOME LEEWAY THERE, BUT JUST KIND OF IN 
22:24:54 THE FRAME OF A LITTLE BIT OF -- I DON'T KNOW WHAT I WANT TO CALL IT, BUT A 
22:24:57 LITTLE BIT HIGHER -- THEY'RE DIGNITARIES BUT A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN 
22:25:04 THE NORMAL U.S. CONGRESSMAN AND -- THERE'S SOME EVENTS THERE AT THE CITY, 
22:25:11 AT CITY HALL.
SO IT'S NOT NECESSARILY FOREIGN BUT IT 
22:25:16 WOULD BE SOMEONE THAT IS NOT A CONGRESSMAN OR ASSEMBLYMEMBER.

22:25:19 SOMETHING TO THAT EFFECT.
>> Mayor Mei: I'LL LET YOU KNOW IF JOE 
22:25:22 CALLS ME.
I'M JUST KIDDING.

22:25:28 >> City Manager Danaj: MAYOR?
>> Mayor Mei: CITY MANAGER  DANAJ.

22:25:31 >> City Manager Danaj: I JUST WANT TO REMIND THE COUNCIL THAT WHATEVER YOU 
22:25:34 DECIDE TONIGHT THAT'S GOING TO GO INTO THIS HANDBOOK, IT REALLY IS YOUR 
22:25:39 HANDBOOK, AND IT'S REALLY UP TO YOU TO FOLLOW IT AND FRANKLY WHEN YOU FEEL 
22:25:42 IT'S APPROPRIATE, ENFORCE IT.
SO NOW THAT HAVING BEEN SAID, I WANT 
22:25:47 TO JUST PUBLICLY SHARE WITH ALL OF YOU, PUBLIC RI SHARE WITH THIS COUNCIL, 
22:25:52 WHEN THERE ARE CITY SPONSORED EVENTS, YOU ARE ALL TREATED AS EQUALS, WHETHER 
22:25:55 IT'S A CITY COUNCIL MEETING OR DECISION-MAKING PROCESS.

22:26:00 AND SO FOR EXAMPLE -- AND ALSO I ALSO WANT TO SAY WE'RE TRYING TO BE MORE 
22:26:03 SENSITIVE TO WHAT WE'VE HEARD FROM THIS COUNCIL AND MEMBERS OF IT.

22:26:11 AND SO THE EXAMPLES OF THE DIRECTOR OF NATURAL RESOURCES, MISPLACED HIS TITLE 
22:26:14 WITH SPECIFICS BUT WHEN HE CAME TO THE CITY, THAT WAS A CITY EVENT BECAUSE HE 
22:26:20 CAME TO TOUR PARTS OF THE CITY AND WE DEDICATED CITY RESOURCES TO THAT, 
22:26:24 RIGHT, SO WE HAD CITY DEPARTMENT HEADS WHO WERE OUT THERE DESCRIBING 
22:26:28 PROJECTS, AND FRANKLY DOING OUR BEST TO REPRESENT THE CITY, PITCH FOR FUNDING, 
22:26:34 WHEN OUR TWO LOCAL CONGRESSMAN CHOSE TO COME DURING RECESS TO TOUR FRANKLY 
22:26:39 THEIR EARMARKS FOR FREMONT THAT'S IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE BILL IN CONGRESS, 
22:26:42 AGAIN, THAT WAS AN OPPORTUNITY THAT WE THOUGHT WAS WORTH OUR TIME AND ENERGY 
22:26:46 SO CITY STAFF WAS  PRESENT, AND OF COURSE IN THOSE INSTANCES, WE WANT YOU 
22:26:49 TO KNOW ABOUT IT AND MAKE YOU FEEL COMFORTABLE TO JOIN US.

22:26:55 SO I JUST WANT TO SHARE AGAIN THAT THIS IS YOUR HANDBOOK TO OBVIOUSLY FOLLOW 
22:26:59 AND ENFORCE, HOWEVER YOU WRITE IT THIS EVENING OR IN THE FUTURE, BUT I ALSO 
22:27:03 DO WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT WE VERY MUCH ARE COMMITTED, YOU ARE ALL EQUALS WHEN 
22:27:09 IT COMES TO A CITY-SPONSORED EVENT, INCLUDING SOMETHING AS SIMPLE BUT YET 
22:27:12 WONDERFUL AS OPENING OUR NEW  AGING WELL CENTER TOMORROW.

22:27:17 SO IF THERE'S ANY OTHER  QUESTION, I'D BE HAPPY TO TAKE THEM.

22:27:22 >> Councilmember Kassan: I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ADD THE -- THAT THE 
22:27:25 DELETION OF "AND WRITTEN" ON PAGE 12.
>> Mayor Mei: THAT'S FINE.

22:27:27 I WAS GOING TO NOTE THAT TOO.
THANK YOU.

22:27:28 >> Councilmember Kassan:FRIENDL Y AMENDMENT.

22:27:32 >> Mayor Mei: YES, THAT'S FINE.
I'LL HAVE TO LEAVE THAT TO RAJ BUT I'M 
22:27:35 SURE HE'S OKAY.
I THINK HE'S GOT HIS HAND  RAISED.

22:27:40 OH, HE'S NODDING.
OKAY.

22:27:43 I'LL TAKE THAT AS A YES.
COUNCILMEMBER KENG.

22:27:47 >> Councilmember Keng: THANK  YOU.
SO I GUESS, YOU KNOW, THE VISIT OF THE 
22:28:00 LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR WAS A LITTLE -- BECAUSE I BELIEVE ONE OF OUR DEPUTY -- 
22:28:03 CHRISTINA BRIGGS WAS ALSO INVOLVED IN THE EVENT.

22:28:06 >> Mayor Mei: AS A GUEST, YES.
>> Councilmember Keng: RIGHT, SO IT'S 
22:28:11 KIND OF LIKE -- KIND OF BLURRY, YOU KNOW, WHERE THE LINE WAS, AND THEN 
22:28:18 KIND OF CREATES CONFUSION, AND THEN WHEN IT'S THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR AND 
22:28:23 KIND OF -- YEAH, PEOPLE FEEL LIKE,  OH, THEY DON'T COME HERE EVERY DAY.

22:28:28 >> City Manager Danaj: I APPRECIATE THAT, AND I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY 
22:28:32 TO RESPOND TO THAT AND I UNDERSTAND YOUR FEELINGS.

22:28:35 THAT WAS AN EVENT, THOUGH, THAT WAS SPONSORED NOT BY THE CITY OF FREMONT, 
22:28:43 IT WAS SPONSORED BY A THIRD PARTY ORGANIZATION, THE CHAMBER IN OUR 
22:28:45 CITY.
THEY INVITED WHO THEY INVITED.

22:28:51 I DID NOT ATTEND, BUT OF COURSE THE PERSON PRINCIPALLY RESPONSIBLE FROM 
22:28:54 THE CITY'S PERSPECTIVE OF INTERACTING WITH THE CHAMBER OR ECONOMIC  
22:28:59 DEVELOPMENT, SINCE SHE HAPPENED TO COME ON THAT TOPIC, WAS PRESENT AND I THINK 
22:29:02 THAT WAS APPROPRIATE.
DO I WISH THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR 
22:29:04 INVITED EVERYBODY?
YES, BUT THAT'S JUST MY OPINION.

22:29:10 IT'S NOT MY AUTHORITY.
>> Mayor Mei: I THINK PART OF  IT -- 
22:29:13 COVID RESTRICTIONS AT THAT TIME BECAUSE IT WAS AN IN-PERSON TOUR.

22:29:16 THAT WAS PART OF IT TOO.
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN AGAIN.

22:29:19 YOU HAVE YOUR HAND RAISED.
>> Councilmember Salwan: YES, SO I'M 
22:29:22 READY TO MAKE THE MOTION.
I THINK THIS IS A LIVING DOCUMENT.

22:29:27 WE DO HAVE A RETREAT ONCE A  YEAR, AND SO I THINK IN GOOD FAITH, WE SHOULD 
22:29:31 MOVE THIS FORWARD AND IF THERE'S ANY FEEDBACK, WE CAN TAKE IT BACK IN 
22:29:37 JANUARY AND KEEP MAKING IT BETTER.
SO I'M READY TO MOVE THIS TO ACCEPT 
22:29:41 THE COUNCIL HANDBOOK.
>> Mayor Mei: WITH THE FRIENDLY 
22:29:43 AMENDMENT FROM COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN.
>> Councilmember Salwan:FRIENDL Y 
22:29:46 AMENDMENT FROM COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN.
>> Councilmember Keng: I'LL SECOND.

22:29:49 >> Mayor Mei: MOTION BY COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN, SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER 
22:29:52 KENG.
ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE.

22:29:55 AND THEN WE NEED A BREAK BEFORE WE FINISH OUR LAST ITEMS.

22:29:59 >> Ms. Gauthier: COUNCILMEMBER COX, AYE.

22:30:03 COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN, AYE.
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, AYE.

22:30:08 COUNCILMEMBER JONES, AYE.
COUNCILMEMBER KENG, AYE.

22:30:12 VICE MAYOR SHAO, AYE.
MAYOR MEI, AYE.

22:30:18 SO THE MOTION PASSES UNANIMOUSLY WITH THE FRIENDLY AMENDMENT, AND WE ARE 
22:30:22 GOING TO TAKE A QUICK 10-MINUTE BREAK BECAUSE OUR STENOCAPTIONER, WE'RE 
22:30:24 OVERDUE, AND WE'LL RETURN WITH THE REMAINING ITEMS.

22:30:27 THANK YOU.
PLEASE DON'T FORGET TO MUTE YOUR MIC.

22:30:30 TURN OFF YOUR VIDEO TOO.
THANK YOU.

22:40:08 [RECESS]
>> Mayor Mei: I'M GOING TO START 
22:40:28 ASKING PEOPLE TO PLEASE RETURN.
I SEE ALL OF OUR COUNCILMEMBERS COMING 
22:40:31 BACK AND THANK YOU TO THE STAFF AND THE SPEAKERS THIS EVENING.

22:41:05 A COUPLE MORE COUNCILMEMBERS.
I THINK THAT'S ALL OF US BACK NOW.

22:41:12 >> Councilmember Salwan: MADAME MAYOR, WHAT'S OUR OFFICIAL END TIME?

22:41:20 >> Mayor Mei: I HOPE WE CAN MOVE THROUGH THE NEXT TWO ITEMS IN A TIMELY 
22:41:22 MANNER.
WE'LL BEGIN WITH OUR NEXT ITEM, WHICH 
22:41:26 IS THE JUNETEENTH HOLIDAY ANALYSIS AND OPTIONS.

22:41:30 JUST TO LET PEOPLE KNOW THAT THIS IS TO ACCEPT THE REPORT AND PROVIDE STAFF 
22:41:36 WITH DIRECTION REGARDING THE COUNCIL'S INTENT TO ESTABLISH JUNETEENTH AS A 
22:41:41 PAID HOLIDAY, AND THIS IS BEING PRESENTED BY ALLEN DEMERS.

22:41:45 ALLEN, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US THIS EVENING.

22:41:51 >> THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR.
I'M GOING TO JUST SAY A FEW WORDS TO 
22:41:58 FRAME THIS ISSUE AND TO CLARIFY, YOU KNOW, WHAT STAFF IS REQUESTING 
22:42:00 SPECIFICALLY BY BRINGING THIS ITEM FORWARD.

22:42:08 SO AS YOU ARE ALL AWARE, IN  JUNE, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ADOPTED JUNETEENTH 
22:42:16 AS A FEDERAL HOLIDAY.
IN EARLY JULY, COUNCILMEMBER COX 
22:42:26 REFERRED THIS ITEM TO THE CITY COUNCIL, AND THE COUNCIL UNANIMOUSLY ADOPTED 
22:42:33 THE REFERRAL TO DIRECT STAFF TO ANALYZE METHODOLOGY TO SUMMARIZE POTENTIAL 
22:42:36 EXPENSES AND TO REVIEW MEET AND CONFER OBLIGATIONS.

22:42:43 SO THE REPORT THAT WE HAVE SUBMITTED TONIGHT CONTAINS THAT INFORMATION, AND 
22:42:49 THERE ARE SOME COMPLEX ISSUES WITHIN THE REPORT ITSELF BUT THE STAFF 
22:42:55 REQUEST IS QUITE SIMPLE, IT IS TO ACCEPT THE REPORT AND TO PROVIDE 
22:43:00 DIRECTION TO STAFF AS TO WHETHER OR NOT COUNCIL WISHES TO MOVE FORWARD WITH 
22:43:08 ESTABLISHING  JUNETEENTH AS A HOLIDAY, WHICH REQUIRES BARGAINING WITH THE 
22:43:10 CITY'S BARGAINING GROUPS UNDER STATE LAW.

22:43:18 AND WITH THAT, I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS REGARDING THE REPORT, 
22:43:22 BUT THAT'S THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION BEFORE YOU.

22:43:27 >> Mayor Mei: SO ARE THERE CLARIFYING QUESTIONS?

22:43:31 I SEE WE HAVE A PUBLIC SPEAKER.
COUNCILMEMBER JONES.

22:43:37 >> Councilmember Jones: JUST SO CLARIFY THE THREE OPTIONS, IF YOU WILL, THAT 
22:43:41 ARE LAID OUT IN THE STAFF REPORT, WE'RE NOT SELECTING AN OPTION, WE ARE SIMPLY 
22:43:46 MOVING FORWARD WITH  HAVING STAFF DO WHATEVER IT IS THEY'RE GOING TO DO 
22:43:51 WITH THE BARGAINING UNITS BUT WE'RE NOT ACTUALLY SELECTING AN OPTION, 
22:43:53 CORRECT?
>> THAT'S CORRECT, COUNCILMEMBER 
22:43:56 JONES.
IF COUNCIL DIRECTS STAFF TO MOVE 
22:43:59 FORWARD WITH CONVENTIONAL BARGAINING WITH THE BARGAINING GROUPS, WE WOULD 
22:44:04 SCHEDULE A CLOSED SESSION TO DISCUSS THE SPECIFICS THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH 
22:44:08 THOSE DIFFERENT OPTIONS.
COUNCIL WOULD DIRECT US IN THAT CLOSED 
22:44:13 SESSION HOW IT WANTS STAFF TO BARGAIN AND IMPLEMENT THIS HOLIDAY.

22:44:20 >> Councilmember Jones: THANK YOU.
>> City Manager Danaj: I WOULD BRIEFLY 
22:44:22 ADD, WHICH IS CONSISTENT OF OUR REQUIREMENT TO BARGAIN.

22:44:27 SO THIS IS THE WAY WE HAVE TO BARGAIN SO THAT IT'S CONSISTENT WITH ANY ITEM 
22:44:30 YOU WOULD BE BARGAINING WITH OUR LABOR GROUPS.

22:44:35 >> Mayor Mei: I WILL JUST MAKE ONE OTHER COMMENT AND I'LL ASK THE PUBLIC 
22:44:40 SPEAKER TO SHARE, BUT THAT ALL THREE OPTIONS ARE  LISTED, AND THEY DO HAVE 
22:44:44 DIFFERENT COSTS THAT CONCUR TO THAT, AND SO I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THE 
22:44:48 PUBLIC DOES RECOGNIZE THAT WHEN WE LOOKED AT THIS IN ASKING OUR STAFF TO 
22:44:52 EXPLORE, WE DID ASK THEM TO LIST THE DIFFERENT OPTIONS THAT WOULD BE 
22:44:58 PRESENTED TO THE BARGAINING GROUPS FOR DISCUSSION, AND THAT THERE ARE 
22:45:02 DIFFERENT COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT.
SO I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE THE 
22:45:05 PUBLIC IS AWARE OF THAT.
AND I'LL CALL THE SPEAKER, CHRIS.

22:45:12 WELCOME.
>> THANK YOU.

22:45:22 I DO SEE THE COST HERE, I'M NOT SURE WHY IT'S 130' THOUSAND DOLLARS 
22:45:23 DIFFERENT COST BETWEEN OPTION ONE AND TWO.

22:45:36 BUT IF IT WERE ME, I WOULD SAY ADD THE HOLIDAY, AND THEN REMOVE 12/24 AND 
22:45:40 12/31 AS HOLIDAYS FOR THE CITY EMPLOYEES AND ADD A SECOND ADDITIONAL 
22:45:42 FLOATING HOLIDAY AND THAT SHOULD KEEP EVERYONE HAPPY.

22:45:50 IT SHOULD ADD UP TO THE SAME NUMBER OF HOLIDAYS, BUT I ASSUME THE FLOATING 
22:45:53 HOLIDAY IS NOT USED BY ALL EMPLOYEES, AND THAT'S WHY YOU'RE SAYING THERE'S 
22:45:57 AN OPTION DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ONE AND TWO, BUT I'LL REPEAT, REMOVE TWO 
22:46:01 CURRENT HOLIDAYS THAT ARE NOT ACTUALLY HOLIDAYS THAT ARE GIVEN TO EMPLOYEES, 
22:46:06 ADD JUNE 19TH, AND ADD A SECOND FLOATING HOLIDAY SO THAT SHOULD MAKE 
22:46:07 EVERYONE WHOLE.
THANK YOU.

22:46:15 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU FOR SHARING, BUT I THINK THAT,  AGAIN, I THINK FOR 
22:46:22 US THIS EVENING, WHAT'S BEFORE US IS TO SAY WHAT WE WOULD LIKE TO PROCEED AND 
22:46:26 THEN HAVE THE STAFF PRESENT THOSE OPTIONS AND TO THE BARGAINING GROUPS 
22:46:28 FOR THEIR NEGOTIATION.
THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE 
22:46:33 DIFFERENT EMPLOYEE GROUPS IN TERMS OF HOW SCHEDULING IS MANAGED, IN 
22:46:41 PARTICULAR FOR SOME OF OUR GROUPS AND DIFFERENT SHIFTS, I THINK THAT'S 
22:46:46 SOMETHING THAT HAS TO BE ADDRESSED SO I WILL LEAVE THAT TO THAT FOR 
22:46:47 DISCUSSION.
COUNCILMEMBER COX, DID YOU HAVE ANY 
22:46:49 OTHER COMMENTS OR DID YOU WANT TO MAKE THE MOTION?

22:46:52 >> Councilmember Cox: I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE THE MOTION THAT WE MOVE FORWARD 
22:47:01 TO RECEIVE THE REPORT AND THAT ALLEN WOULD THEN REPORT BACK ON THE OUTCOME 
22:47:10 OF SOME OF THE DISCUSSION WITH THE OTHER LABOR GROUPS AND REPORT BACK TO 
22:47:13 US.
>> Councilmember Salwan: SECOND.

22:47:15 >> Mayor Mei: YES, AND I JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY, THE RECOMMENDATION IS TO 
22:47:20 ACCEPT THE REPORT AND PROVIDE STAFF DIRECTION TO ESTABLISH AND ALSO TO 
22:47:23 REQUIRE I GUESS DIRECT STAFF TO HAVE A CLOSED SESSION FOR THE COUNCIL TO GIVE 
22:47:27 AN UPDATE WHEN THAT TIME COMES.
>> Councilmember Cox: THANK YOU FOR 
22:47:32 THE FRIENDLY -- MAYOR, THANK YOU FOR THE FRIENDLY AMENDMENT.

22:47:35 >> Mayor Mei: I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE.

22:47:37 THANK YOU.

22:50:10 >> Councilmember Jones: YEAH, I KNOW I NEVER SPEAK AT THE END OF THE MEETING 
22:50:14 BUT I JUST WANTED TO MAKE A COMMENT ABOUT THE DUMBARTON QUARRY OPENING 
22:50:21 ABOUT A WEEK AND A HALF AGO.
SUZANNE WOLF, KIM BERANEK AND THE NEXT 
22:50:27 DAY WE WERE JOINED BY JOEL PULLEN WERE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE NEW 
22:50:31 CAMPGROUND, IT'S A GREAT PLACE, IT'S GOING TO BE A GREAT AMENT FOR OUR 
22:50:34 COMMUNITY.
IT'S GOING TO BE ABOUT 15 YEARS BEFORE 
22:50:37 THE TREES GET TALL ENOUGH TO PROVIDE ANY SHADE, BUT EVERYTHING ELSE IS 
22:50:40 GREAT.
>> Mayor Mei: I ABSOLUTELY  AGREE.

22:50:45 I WOULD ONLY MENTION IT AS BEAUTIFUL AT NIGHTTIME AS WELL AS DAY TIME, BUT IF 
22:50:51 YOU'RE THERE AT DUSK, I WOULD RECOMMEND SOME MOSQUITO SPRAY, BECAUSE I WAS A 
22:50:53 LITTLE BIT OF DESSERT FOR THEM.
SO I'D RECOMMEND THAT.

22:51:01 BUT IT IS AN INCREDIBLY BEAUTIFUL JEWEL, AS WE TALKED THIS EVENING ABOUT 
22:51:04 PARKS AND INDOOR RECREATION FACILITIES.

22:51:07 I KNOW ALL OF OUR COUNCIL WILL BE THERE, OR AT LEAST WE'RE INVITED 
22:51:12 TOMORROW, TO THE AGE WELL CENTER FOR THE DEDICATION AND RIBBON CUTTING 
22:51:16 TOMORROW, AND I HAVE TO THANK JOHN WONG AND OTHER PEOPLE WHO HELPED, 
22:51:19 ESPECIALLY OUR STAFF AND OTHERS WHO HELPED MAKE THIS HAPPEN.

22:51:25 SO I'M VERY MUCH LOOKING FORWARD TO THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROCEED IN OPENING UP 
22:51:29 ANOTHER FACILITY THAT WILL ALLOW MORE RESOURCES TO BE ACCESSIBLE FOR OUR 
22:51:32 COMMUNITY AND MUCH NEEDED IN THIS TIME.

22:51:37 AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THE NEW AGE WELL CENTER AS WELL AS THERE WILL BE 
22:51:39 OTHER OPPORTUNITIES COMING UP FOR OTHER FACILITIES THIS YEAR.

22:51:43 AND WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO HELP PROVIDE THOSE FOR OUR COMMUNITY.

22:51:46 THANK YOU FOR ALL THE PEOPLE WHO STAYED ON THIS EVENING, WHO HAVE BEEN PUBLIC 
22:51:49 SPEAKERS AND LISTENED, AND THANK YOU TO OUR STAFF.

22:51:55 SO WITH THAT, I WAS JUST GOING TO SAY, WE ARE AT 95% VACCINATED SINGLE SHOT, 
22:52:01 82% JUST ABOUT FULLY VACCINATED, AND SO THANK YOU ALL FOR THAT EFFORT, AND TO 
22:52:05 KEEP CONTINUE WORKING WITH US AS WE TRY TO SAFELY RE-OPEN AND AS WE WORK WITH 
22:52:09 ALL OF OUR FELLOW INSTITUTIONS AND ESPECIALLY WITH STAFF AS WE ARE 
22:52:13 LOOKING FORWARD TO EVENTUALLY RETURNING BACK TO THE CHAMBER AND THE CHANCE TO 
22:52:17 BE ABLE TO SHARE THAT WITH ALL OF YOU.
WISHING YOU ALL WELL AND HEALTH AND 
22:52:24 FOR THOSE WHO ARE CELEBRATING ROSH HASHANAH, A SWEET NEW YEAR.
