EXPRESS MY CONCERNS REGARDING
THE

[Captioner] 20:02:14
 WORDS OF THIS PROCLAMATION
THAT HAS BEEN PROPOSED.
I

[Captioner] 20:02:17
 WOULD LIKE TO BRING YOUR
ATTENTION TO THE WORD "HINDU


[Captioner] 20:02:21
PHOBIA" USED IN THIS
PROCLAMATION.
SCHOLARS HAVE QUESTIONED

[Captioner] 20:02:24
 THE USE
OF THIS TERM IT IS BEING PUSHED
BY THE

[Captioner] 20:02:28
 MOST EXTREME AND RIGHT
WING

[Captioner] 20:02:31
 HINDU GROUPS TO STIFLE THE

 AGAINST ETHNIC AND
RELIGIOUS MINORITIES.


[Captioner] 20:02:37
WHILE WE SUPPORT THE INTENT OF
THE PROCLAMATION WE

[Captioner] 20:02:40
 BELIEVE THE
CURRENT WORDING DENIGRATES THE


[Captioner] 20:02:44
OTHERS AND IT EXCLUDES OTHER


[Captioner] 20:02:48
INDIANS FROM THE PROTECTION THE
PROCLAMATION SEEKS TO

[Captioner] 20:02:50
 PROVIDE.
THEREFORE, I URGE THE CITY
COUNCIL TO PASS THE PROCLAMATION


[Captioner] 20:02:54
BUT WITH THE REMOVAL OF

[Captioner] 20:02:58
 SB 403
AND INSTEAD FOCUS ON LANGUAGE
THAT IS

[Captioner] 20:17:51
EVERYONE.
SO I'M EXCITED TO SHARE WITH YOU
THE URBAN

[Captioner] 20:17:54
 FORESTRY EFFORTS THAT
I'VE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO
PARTICIPATE IN IN

[Captioner] 20:17:57
 OVER THE LAST
THREE YEARS WITH THE CITY.
AND,

[Captioner] 20:18:00
 MY PRESENTATION, IF YOU GO
TO THE NEXT SLIDE, WILL

[Captioner] 20:18:04
 COVER
THESE FIVE TOPIC ITEMS.
AND WHAT I WANTED TO

[Captioner] 20:18:07
 SHARE HERE
IS THAT THIS IS

[Captioner] 20:18:10
 A

[Captioner] 20:18:14
 PIVOTAL MOMENT
FOR FREMONT'S URBAN FORESTS.
CON

[Captioner] 20:18:17
 OF THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE
ANALYSIS OF URBAN

[Captioner] 20:18:21
 FORESTS BASED
ON SEEING WHAT IS DONE IN THE
INDUSTRY WITH THESE

[Captioner] 20:18:24
 TOPIC ITEMS
ON THE AGENDA, WE WILL GET INTO
THE

[Captioner] 20:18:27
 PRESS ENTATION ON THE NEXT
SLIDE.
SO THE

[Captioner] 20:18:30
 SLIDE THAT I WILL BE
PRESENTING ON BUILD UP TO THESE


[Captioner] 20:18:34
GOALS DEVELOPED FOR THE
MANAGEMENT PLAN AND

[Captioner] 20:18:37
 THESE GOALS
WERE DEVELOPED WITH ANALYSIS,


[Captioner] 20:18:41
BENCHMARKING, INTERNAL AND
EXTERNAL ENGAGEMENT AND

[Captioner] 20:18:44
 ALIGN
WITH THE HOLISTIC PLANNING
APPROACH.


[Captioner] 20:18:47
NEXT.
SO, BEFORE WESTERN ABLE TO DRAFT
THESE

[Captioner] 20:18:51
 GOALS FOR THE CANOPY, WE
HAD TO

[Captioner] 20:18:54
 GET AN UNDERSTANDING OF
THE CURRENT EXTENT OF

[Captioner] 20:18:57
 THE URBAN
FOREST AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR
EXPANSION

[Captioner] 20:19:00
 IN 2020 A TOP-DOWN
LOOK AT THE

[Captioner] 20:19:03
 CANOPY COVER AGAINST
COVER AND PRIVATE BOUNDARIES WAS


[Captioner] 20:19:06
COMPLETED WHERE WE FOUND THAT
14% OF THE CITY IS SHADED BY THE


[Captioner] 20:19:10
CANOPY OF TREES WHEN VIEWS FROM
THE ABOVE.
ONE THING TO NOTE

[Captioner] 20:19:13
 ABOUT THIS IS
9 PRESIDENTS OF THE CANOPY IS


[Captioner] 20:19:17
NOTED ON PRIVATE LAND AND 4
PRESIDENTS SON PUBLIC LAND

[Captioner] 20:19:20
 SO
THIS EMPHASIZED A FEED NEED TORE


[Captioner] 20:19:23
A SHARED COMMITMENT TO THE GOALS
IN THE URBAN FOREST

[Captioner] 20:19:24
 MANAGEMENT
PLAN.
NEXT.


[Captioner] 20:19:28
TO ACHIEVE THESE GOALS, THE CITY
NOW HAS

[Captioner] 20:19:31
 AN INTERACTIVE ONLINE
GIS TOOL TO VIEW THE

[Captioner] 20:19:35
 EXTENT THE
TREE CANOPY COVER ACROSS


[Captioner] 20:19:38
DIFFERENT BOUNDARIES AND IT IS
AVAILABLE ON 9

[Captioner] 20:19:41
 URBAN FORESTRY
WEB PAGE OF THE CITY WITH THIS
TOOL WE

[Captioner] 20:19:44
 ARE ABLE TO LOOK AT
AREAS WITH LOW TREE COVER AND
THIS

[Captioner] 20:19:49
 IS LOOKING AT TREE COVER,
AS AN EXAMPLE,

[Captioner] 20:19:52
 BUT THEN WE CAN
LOOK ACROSS THE CITY AS A
PRIORITY,

[Captioner] 20:19:56
 AREAS UNDER SERVED
WITH POPULATIONS AND URBAN

[Captioner] 20:19:59
 HEAT.
BECK TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT IT WILL
TAKE TO

[Captioner] 20:20:03
 INCREASE TREE CANOPY IN
THOSE PRIORITY AREAS.


[Captioner] 20:20:06
THIS EXAMPLE LOOKS AT, AT A
HYPOTHETICAL

[Captioner] 20:20:10
 SCENARIO, HOW MANY
TREES ARE REQUIRED TO BRING

[Captioner] 20:20:13
 THE
PRIORITY AREAS TO THE 20%

[Captioner] 20:20:16
 TREE
COVER WE FIND IT REQUIRES 6,000


[Captioner] 20:20:19
TREES AND FUTURE BENEFIT OF
THOSE TREES THERE IS ONE

[Captioner] 20:20:22
 EXAMPLE
BY PLANTING 6,000 TREES WILL
WILL

[Captioner] 20:20:26
 BE 8,000 POUNDS OF CARBON
SEQUESTERED.
YOU CAN

[Captioner] 20:20:29
 SEE HOW THIS SUPPORTS
UNDER SERVED

[Captioner] 20:20:33
 COMMUNITIES,
ADDRESSES URBAN HEAT AND LOOKS


[Captioner] 20:20:36
AT ADDRESSING THE EFFECTS OF
CLIE PLAT CHANGE USING

[Captioner] 20:20:38
 THIS
CANOPY DATA.
NEXT.


[Captioner] 20:20:41
THE CITY ALSO COMPLETED A
BOTTOM-UP APPROACH LOOKING AT
THE

[Captioner] 20:20:44
 URBAN FOREST BY CONDUCTING A
CITY WIDE

[Captioner] 20:20:48
 PUBLIC TREE INVENTORY
AND IT IS ONE OF THE MOST
COMPREHENSIVE

[Captioner] 20:20:51
 INVENTORIES OF
PUBLIC TREES.
THERE ARE OVER 77,000

[Captioner] 20:20:55
 TREES
INVENTORIED TREE BY TREE BY AN


[Captioner] 20:20:59
ARBORIST WHO COLLECTED
INFORMATION ON

[Captioner] 20:21:02
 THINGS LIKE AS
FECES, MAINTENANCE

[Captioner] 20:21:05
 NEEDS AND
SIZE.
ONE THING TO NOTE WITH THIS

[Captioner] 20:21:08
 GOOD
ARE BODY

[Captioner] 20:21:11
 ARE DATA,

[Captioner] 20:21:16
 BUT 70% OF
STREET TREES BASED ON THE
PROPERTY

[Captioner] 20:21:19
 OWNER TO MAINTAIN THIS
GOES BACK TO THE SHARED
COMMITMENT AND

[Captioner] 20:21:22
 GOALS ABOUT
COMMUNITY EDUCATION, OUTREACH
WITH AND

[Captioner] 20:21:25
 ENGAGEMENT TO ACHIEVE
SUSTAINABLE URBAN

[Captioner] 20:21:29
 FORESTRY.
NEXT.
NOW, ONE OF THE MOST EXCITING


[Captioner] 20:21:32
THINGS TO COME OUT OF THIS
PROJECT IS THIS ONLINE TOOL

[Captioner] 20:21:35
 VIEW
THE 77,000 TREES ACROSS THE
CITY.


[Captioner] 20:21:38
AND THE CITY CAN USE THIS TO
MANAGE THE DATA AND LOOK

[Captioner] 20:21:42
 AT
TREES AND PRIORITIES AND
PROGRAMS, BUT NOW THIS

[Captioner] 20:21:45
 IS ALSO
AVAILABLE AT THE FINGERTIPS OF


[Captioner] 20:21:48
THE COMMUNITY.
FLYNN WITH A SMART PHONE, TABLET


[Captioner] 20:21:51
OR COMPUTER CAN TYPE IN AN
ADDRESS OR EXPLORE THE

[Captioner] 20:21:54
 MAN AND
SO THIS EXAMPLE LOOKS AT COUNCIL
CHAMBERS

[Captioner] 20:21:57
 AND WE START TO SEE
THAT BY CLICKING ON A TREE

[Captioner] 20:22:01
 POINT
WE GET A STREET VIEW OF THE TREE
THAT WAS

[Captioner] 20:22:05
 INVENTORIED ALONG WITH
THE INFORMATION COLLECTED SO THE
TREE OUT FRONT IS A

[Captioner] 20:22:10
 SYCAMORE, A
20-INCH DIAMETER AND

[Captioner] 20:22:13
 PROVIDING
NEARLY $17,000 IN ASSET VALUE


[Captioner] 20:22:16
THIS INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE ON
THE CITY'S WEBSITE AND EVERY


[Captioner] 20:22:19
TREE HAS THE ECOSYSTEM BENEFITS


[Captioner] 20:22:22
CALCULATED.
SO THE TREES THAT ARE ADJACENT
TO PROPERTY OWNERS

[Captioner] 20:22:25
 THEY
MAINTAIN, THEY CAN SEE THE
BENEFITS OF THE MAINTENANCE


[Captioner] 20:22:29
PRACTICES AND HOW IT SUPPORTS
OTHER GOALS IN THE CITY,

[Captioner] 20:22:32
 SUCH AS
CLIMATE CHANGE, AIR AND WATER


[Captioner] 20:22:37
QUALITY.
NEXT.
NOW, THESE PUBLIC

[Captioner] 20:22:40
 TREES AND THE
ENTIRE URBAN FOREST PROVIDE


[Captioner] 20:22:44
BENEFITS AND SERVICES SUCH AT
THE ONES LISTED ON THIS

[Captioner] 20:22:47
 SLIDE
AND THE OVER ARCHING GOAL OF THE
MANAGEMENT

[Captioner] 20:22:50
 PLAN IS TO MAXIMIZE
THE LONG-TERM BENEFITS OF

[Captioner] 20:22:53
 TREES
BOTH SUSTAINABLY AND EQUITABLY.
ON THE

[Captioner] 20:22:57
 NEXT SIDE, WE TALK ABOUT
HOW WE WANTIFIED THOSE SPECIFIC


[Captioner] 20:23:00
BENEFITS OF THE PUBLIC TREES.
THOSE 77,000 TRIES WHEN

[Captioner] 20:23:04
 WE APPLY
RESEARCH TO THE DATA PROVIDE


[Captioner] 20:23:08
NEARLY $7 MILLION IN ECOSYSTEM
BENEFITS ANNUALINGLY TO THE


[Captioner] 20:23:12
COMMUNITY AND ALSO WE LOOK AT
THE ASSET VALUE, THE

[Captioner] 20:23:15
 STRUCTURAL
VALUE OF THOSE TREES WHICH
EQUATES TO NEARLY

[Captioner] 20:23:19
 HALF A BILLION
DOLLARS.
NOW, ONE THING WITH THE

[Captioner] 20:23:22

RESEARCH, IT SHOWS THAT FOR
EVERY DOLLAR INVESTED IN A


[Captioner] 20:23:25
COMMUNITY TREE, THERE IS A $5
RETURN ON YOUR

[Captioner] 20:23:28
 INVESTMENT, AND
TREES ARE ONE OF THE FEW

[Captioner] 20:23:33



[Captioner] 20:23:36
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT INCREASE IN
VALUE OVER TIME.
SPECIFICALLY FOR

[Captioner] 20:23:39
 FREMONT, FOR
EVERY DOLLAR INVESTED IN A TREE
THERE IS OVER

[Captioner] 20:23:43
 A $7 RETURN IN
INVESTMENT SO BY

[Captioner] 20:23:46
 IMPLEMENTING
THIS MANAGEMENT PLAN WE CAN
SUSTAIN THESE

[Captioner] 20:23:50
 BENEFITS FOR THE
LONG-TERM.
NEXT SO IN ORDER TO

[Captioner] 20:23:53
 MAXIMIZE
THOSE BENEFITS THAT I SHARED, WE
DEVELOPED THIS

[Captioner] 20:23:56
 TIMELINE FOR THE
PROJECT BEGINNING WITH THE
RESEARCH AND

[Captioner] 20:23:59
 ANALYSIS PHASE IN
2021 AND THAT'S WHERE WE
CONDUCTED THE

[Captioner] 20:24:03
 ANALYSIS OF DATA
AND BENCHMARKING AND THEN OVER
THE COURSE OF A

[Captioner] 20:24:07
 YEAR WE
CONDUCTED INTERNAL AND EXTERN
ALLEGATION

[Captioner] 20:24:10
 ENGAGEMENT AND OUT
REACH.
AND THESE EFFORTS LED TO

[Captioner] 20:24:13
 A
SHARED VISION WITH STRATEGIES
THAT ADDRESS SHARED

[Captioner] 20:24:17
 PRIORITIES
ACROSS THE CITY AND THAT LED TO
THE DRAFTS

[Captioner] 20:24:20
 AND TO THE FINAL
DEVELOPMENT OF THE URBAN FOREST


[Captioner] 20:24:24
MANAGEMENT PLAN.
NEXT.


[Captioner] 20:24:28
SO EXPANDING ON THE ENGAGEMENT


[Captioner] 20:24:31
COMPONENT, THAT WAS A HUGE PART
OF THIS PROJECT, INTERNALLY WE
HAD

[Captioner] 20:24:35
 A TEAM OF 10 FROM THE CITY
DEPARTMENTS

[Captioner] 20:24:38
 RENTING THREE
DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS, 25 STAFF


[Captioner] 20:24:42
INTERVIEWED.
WE PRESENTED TO RECREATION
COMMISSION AND AS FAR

[Captioner] 20:24:45
 AS EXTERN
ALLEGATION ENGAGEMENT, WE
STARTED OFF WITH

[Captioner] 20:24:49
 A MESSAGING
CAMPAIGN, HAD A PROJECT

[Captioner] 20:24:52
 WEBSITE,
MEETINGS AND MEET

[Captioner] 20:24:55
 AND GREATS

[Captioner] 20:24:58

AS WELL AS POLLS AND SURVEYS TO
GATHER

[Captioner] 20:25:02
 FEEDBACK.
ALL THESE EFFORTS WERE TO
DEVELOP

[Captioner] 20:25:05
 THE SHARED VISION AROUND
TRIES IN THE

[Captioner] 20:25:09
 COMMUNITY.
NEXT

[Captioner] 20:25:15
.
I WANTED TO EXPAND ON PUBLIC
COMMENT AS

[Captioner] 20:25:18
 BEMET WITH THE
WORKING GROUP.
WE HEARD A VARIETY OF

[Captioner] 20:25:21
 FEEDBACK
AND INPUT, SOME RELATED TO THE
STATUS

[Captioner] 20:25:24
 OF OTHER URBAN FORESTRY
PROJECTS THERE

[Captioner] 20:25:27
 BASS AN M SAYS TO
PLANT FOR

[Captioner] 20:25:31
 TREES AND TO STA -- AN


[Captioner] 20:25:34
EMPHASIS TO PLANT MORE TREES

[Captioner] 20:25:38
 AND
TO STAFF AND HAVING A STRONG
FOUNDATION OF

[Captioner] 20:25:41
 ORDINANCES AND
POLICIES AROUND TREES IN THE
COMMUNITY.


[Captioner] 20:25:45
LASTLY WE HEARD ABOUT THE RENTED
TREE LIST THAT BATS IN THE
MANAGEMENT

[Captioner] 20:25:48
 PLAN AND HOW TO MAKE
SOME UPDATES IN ORDER

[Captioner] 20:25:52
 TO ENSURE
TREES SURVIVE AND THRIVE IN
CHANGING

[Captioner] 20:25:57
 CLIMATES.
NEXT SO THERE ARE A LOT

[Captioner] 20:26:00
 OF
CHALLENGES FACING THE TREES IN
FREMONT INTO THE

[Captioner] 20:26:04
 FUTURE, BUT ONE
THING THIS PLANNING EFFORT
UNCOVERED WAS

[Captioner] 20:26:07
 THE NUMBER OF
STRENGTHS AROUND THE URBAN
FOREST IN

[Captioner] 20:26:10
 FREMONT.
WE SEE A WIDE DIVERSITY

[Captioner] 20:26:14
 OF TREE
SPECIES AND THE SUBSTANTIAL


[Captioner] 20:26:17
BENEFITS OF TREES YOU DISCUSSED


[Captioner] 20:26:20
EARLIER.
SPECIFIC TO THE PROGRAM THERE IS
AN URBAN

[Captioner] 20:26:23
 FORESTRY PROGRAM WHERE
NOT EVERY CITY IN CALIFORNIA HAS
THE A

[Captioner] 20:26:26
 PROGRAM AND THE COMMUNITY,
WE HEARD A LOT OF STRENGTHS
AROUND

[Captioner] 20:26:29
 THE SUPPORT, THEIR' VOCAL
AND ACTIVE AND

[Captioner] 20:26:33
 SUPPORTING THIS
EFFORT AND THE CITY HAS BEEN
RECOGNIZED AT A

[Captioner] 20:26:36
 TREE CITY USA
FOR NOW 26

[Captioner] 20:26:42
 YEARS.
THIS IS THE FIRST

[Captioner] 20:26:45
 EVER PLAN FOR
THE CITY AROUND THE URBAN

[Captioner] 20:26:48
 FOREST
AND DEVELOPED THIS SHARED VISION
WITH STRATEGIES SUPPORTED BY


[Captioner] 20:26:51
STAFF, STAKEHOLDERS AND THE
COMMUNITY 78

[Captioner] 20:26:55
 NEXT.
SO

[Captioner] 20:26:58
 THIS URBAN FOREST VISION IN
THE MANAGEMENT PLAN, IT LOOKED


[Captioner] 20:27:01
 LOOKED


[Captioner] 20:27:05
 LOOKED
TO MAXIMIZE THE

[Captioner] 20:27:08
 BENEFITS
SUSTAINABLY AND A HEALTHY URBAN


[Captioner] 20:27:11
FOREST CREATE AS HEALTHY
COMMUNITY.
TO SUPPORT THIS VISION

[Captioner] 20:27:14
 FOR THE
URBAN FOREST, THERE IS THIS OVER


[Captioner] 20:27:17
ARCHING GOAL TO INCREASE TREE
COVER BY 10% OVER

[Captioner] 20:27:21
 A 40-YEAR TIME
FRAME.
NOW THIS 10 PRESIDENTS

[Captioner] 20:27:24
 INCREASE
WOULD --

[Captioner] 20:27:28
 10% INCREASE WOULD
OCCUR ON PUBLIC AND PRIVATE LAND
SO THIS IS GOING

[Captioner] 20:27:31
 BACK TO THE
SHARED COMMITMENT TO THE URBAN
FOREST AND YOU

[Captioner] 20:27:34
 WILL SEE IN THE
PLAN STRATEGIES AND ACTIONS


[Captioner] 20:27:37
RELATING TO COMMUNITY 

[Captioner] 20:27:42
 EDUCATION
AND ENGAGEMENT TO ACHIEVE THESE
LOFTY

[Captioner] 20:27:45
 BUT ATTAINABLE GOALS.
NEXT.
ALL OF THAT EFFORT

[Captioner] 20:27:48
 WENT
GAUGEMENT, ANALYSIS AND

[Captioner] 20:27:52
 CANOPY
GOALS LED TO THE DRAFTING OF THE


[Captioner] 20:27:55
GOALS IN THE MANAGEMENT PLAN
ITSELF.
AS I MENTIONED,

[Captioner] 20:27:58
 THESE GOALS
APPLY A HOLISTIC PLANNING
APPROACH TO

[Captioner] 20:28:02
 URBAN FORESTRY
BEGINNING WITH MANAGING TREES AS
A CITY

[Captioner] 20:28:06
 ASSET.
BE WE THEN ALSO DEVELOP

[Captioner] 20:28:09
 GOALS
AROUND GROWING A SUSTAINABLE
URBAN FOREST AND STRENGTHENING


[Captioner] 20:28:12
THE PROGRAMS AROUND TREES IN THE
COMMUNITY AND ALSO

[Captioner] 20:28:15
 PRESERVING
THE EXISTING

[Captioner] 20:28:19
 14% OF CANOPY AND
BUILDING THOSE COMMUNITY

[Captioner] 20:28:23
 PILLS,
RELATIONSHIPS AND PROGRAMS TO
SUPPORT ALL

[Captioner] 20:28:26
 ASPECTS OF URBANFORESTRY IN

[Captioner] 20:28:29
 THE CITY 78

[Captioner] 20:28:33
 NEXT SO
WITH EACH GOAL THERE ARE
STRATEGIC ACTION THAT ARE SMART


[Captioner] 20:28:36
THAT SUPPORT THE GOALS AND THE
VISION OF THE URBAN

[Captioner] 20:28:39
 FOREST
MANAGEMENT PLAN AND THEY'RE
ORGANIZED BY

[Captioner] 20:28:42
 SHORT, MIDTERM,
LONG-TERM AND ON GOING ACTIONS.
SOME

[Captioner] 20:28:45
 OF THE EXAMPLES OF THE
SHORT-TERM

[Captioner] 20:28:49
 ACTIONS INCLUDE
LAUNCHING THE PLANTING EFFORT TO
SUPPORT

[Captioner] 20:28:52
 THAT CITY WIDE CANOPY
GOAL.
IT

[Captioner] 20:28:55
 INCLUDES DEVELOPING A
COMMUNICATIONS PLANNING FOR THE
PUBLIC AND SOME

[Captioner] 20:28:59
 OF THE LONGER
TERM GOALS INCLUDE SCALING UP
THOSE

[Captioner] 20:29:02
 PLANTINGS OVER TIME,
LOOKING AT ADDRESSING STRATEGIES


[Captioner] 20:29:06
AND PROGRAMS AROUND STORM
PREPAREDNESS, GROWING

[Captioner] 20:29:09
 A
RESILIENT URBAN FOREST AND
REALLY STRENGTHENING THOSE


[Captioner] 20:29:12
PARTNERSHIPS TO THE ACHIEVE THAT
40-YEAR GOAL

[Captioner] 20:29:15
 OF 24% CANOPY.


[Captioner] 20:29:26
NEXT SLIDE PLEASE.
I WILL TURN TAKEOVER TO

[Captioner] 20:29:29
 SUZANNE
BUT I SHARED WITH YOU THE SCOPE
AND

[Captioner] 20:29:33
 TIMELINE, ENGAGEMENT THAT
LED TO THE SHARED VISION OF
TREES IN FREMONT

[Captioner] 20:29:36
 AND DISCUSS HOW
WE INCORN RATED PUBLIC COMMENT
AND

[Captioner] 20:29:40
 FEEDBACK INTO THE FINALIZED
PLAN FOR THE URBAN FOREST.


[Captioner] 20:29:43
AND SO, WITH THAT SHARED, I WILL
TURN IT OVER TO

[Captioner] 20:29:46
 SUZANNE TO TALK
ABOUT THE COMPLETED AND NEXT
STEPS.


[Captioner] 20:29:49
THANK YOU.
>> THANK YOU, CHRIS.
NEXT

[Captioner] 20:29:53
 SLIDE, PLEASE.
SO BEFORE YOU

[Captioner] 20:29:57
 A RECOMMENDATION
TO FIND

[Captioner] 20:30:00
 THE URBAN FOREST
MANAGEMENT PLAN COMMENT FROM THE


[Captioner] 20:30:04
REQUIREMENTS THE CEQA, PER
GUIDELINES

[Captioner] 20:30:07
 STATED IN THE STAFF
REPORT.
AND TWO, ADOPT

[Captioner] 20:30:11
 A RESOLUTION
ADOPTING THE URBAN FOREST


[Captioner] 20:30:13
MANAGEMENT PLAN.
WE WILL TAKE ANY QUESTIONS YOU
HAVE.


[Captioner] 20:30:16
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU FOR THE
PRESENTATION.
AT THIS

[Captioner] 20:30:20
 TIME, WE WILL ASK FOR
CLARIFYING ECONOMIES FROM THE


[Captioner] 20:30:24
COUNCIL.
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, DO YOU
HAVE CLARIFYING

[Captioner] 20:30:28
 QUESTIONS?
>> YES, I DO.
THREE

[Captioner] 20:30:31
 QUESTIONS SONG NUMBER

[Captioner] 20:30:34
 QUESTION

[Captioner] 20:30:38
S, SO NUMBER ONE,
OUR CURRENT TREE COVER

[Captioner] 20:30:41
 IS 14%
AND ACCORDING TO THIS PLAN WE
WILL ONLY

[Captioner] 20:30:44
 BE INCREASING THAT UP
TO 16S ABOUT

[Captioner] 20:30:48
 16% IN 20 YEARS.
IS THERE ANY

[Captioner] 20:30:51
 POSSIBLE WAY THAT
WE COULD FRONT

[Captioner] 20:30:55
 LOAD MORE FREE
PLANTING, BECAUSE 20 YEARS TO


[Captioner] 20:30:58
INCREASE BY 2% IS JUST SEEMS


[Captioner] 20:31:04
INSANELY BAD.
THANK YOU.
THAT'S QUESTION

[Captioner] 20:31:07
 NUMBER ONE.


[Captioner] 20:31:13
>> THAT FOR THE QUESTION.
WE ARE LOOKING TO

[Captioner] 20:31:17
 REALLY FOCUS
ON WHAT CHRIS TALKED ABOUT IN
TERMS OF OUR

[Captioner] 20:31:20
 PARTNERSHIP AND
STRENGTHENING OUR EDUCATION TO
THE COMMUNITY

[Captioner] 20:31:23
 AS PART OF OUR
INITIAL PROCESS WHICH IS

[Captioner] 20:31:26
 WHY WE
SEE GROWTH OVER THE YEARS.
SOME IS PUBLIC

[Captioner] 20:31:29
 LAND BUT SOME IS
PRIVATE LAND AND

[Captioner] 20:31:33
 THAT PRIVATE
LAND GROWTH WILL TAKE EDUCATION
AND THE

[Captioner] 20:31:36
 STRENGTH OF OUR
COMMUNITY WANT TO TO PLANT

[Captioner] 20:31:39
 TREES
TOGETHER AND THAT IS WHY WE

[Captioner] 20:31:43
 SEE
THE GROWTH MODEL THAT INCREASES
IN THE FUTURE.


[Captioner] 20:31:46
WE HAVE A GRANT THAT ALLOWS US
TO

[Captioner] 20:31:50
 PLANT 1,000 TREES NEXT YEAR,
OVER THE NEXT THREE

[Captioner] 20:31:53
 YEARS WE
WILL PLANT A THOUSAND TREES BUT
WE ARE LOOKING TO

[Captioner] 20:31:56
 GROW THAT IN A
WAY THE COMMUNITY BUYS IN

[Captioner] 20:31:59
 AND
HAS THE COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS
WE CAN GROW WITH IT AND EDUCATE


[Captioner] 20:32:03
AND ACHIEVE THOSE GOALS
TOGETHER.
>> OKAY.


[Captioner] 20:32:06
I DIDN'T REALLY FEEL LIKE I
HEARD AN ANSWER TO THE

[Captioner] 20:32:09
 QUESTION
WHETHER IT COULD BE

[Captioner] 20:32:12
 EXP-E
INDICTED.
WHY CAN'T THE

[Captioner] 20:32:16
 --

[Captioner] 20:32:21
 EXPEDITED.
I UNDERSTAND DOING EVERYTHING WE
CAN BUT DOING

[Captioner] 20:32:24
 A PLAN WITH SUCH
MAIN MALL IMPACT OVER 20 YEARS,
IT

[Captioner] 20:32:27
 IS HARD FOR ME TO BE EXCITED


[Captioner] 20:32:30
ABOUT THAT.


[Captioner] 20:32:35
>> YEAH, AS SUZANNE SAID, THIS
IS LOOKING

[Captioner] 20:32:38
 TO SCALE UP OVER TIME
AND BUILD THOSE RELATIONSHIPS


[Captioner] 20:32:41
BECAUSE A LOT OF THE AVAILABLE
SPACE TO PLANT TREES

[Captioner] 20:32:45
 IS ON
PRIVATE PROPERTY, I ALSO


[Captioner] 20:32:48
MENTIONED HOW STREET TREES OF
THE RESPONSIBILITY OF 9

[Captioner] 20:32:51
 ADJACENT
PROPERTY OWNER SO WE WANT TO
MAKE SURE IT INVESTMENTS

[Captioner] 20:32:55
 INTO
TREES ARE SUSTAINABLE AND FOR
THE

[Captioner] 20:32:58
 LONG-TERM.
AND, SOMETIMES WITH

[Captioner] 20:33:01
 ROBUST
PLANTING GOALS THEY'RE PUT IN
THE GROUND BOUT

[Captioner] 20:33:05
 THE POST
PLANTING CARE AND LONG-TERM
MAINTENANCE INVOLVED SO

[Captioner] 20:33:08
 THEN WE
WORRY ABOUT THE HEALTH AND
CONTINUE OF THOSE

[Captioner] 20:33:11
 TREES.
AND SO THE IDEA IS THAT TO START


[Captioner] 20:33:15
GRAD BALLY, WORKING WITH HOW THE


[Captioner] 20:33:18
PROGRAMS OPERATE TO GET THE


[Captioner] 20:33:21
PROJECT IN PLANTING LAUNCHED AND
THEN, FROM THAT PERIOD

[Captioner] 20:33:24
 ON, YOU
WILL SEE IT SCALES
UNDRAMATICALLY AFTER

[Captioner] 20:33:27
 A NUMBER OF
YEARS AND THAT'S WITH THE


[Captioner] 20:33:31
IMPLEMENTATION OF SOME OF THOSE
OTHER STRATEGIES IN THE PLAN.
WE

[Captioner] 20:33:34
 DID TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT IT


[Captioner] 20:33:37
WOULD LOOK LIKE FOR REACHING
HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF

[Captioner] 20:33:40
 CANOPY
GOALS OR SHORTENING THE TIME
FRAME AND

[Captioner] 20:33:44
 THE DOLLAR AMOUNTS
ASSOCIATED WITH THAT.


[Captioner] 20:33:47
WE'RE JUST FROM THE FEEDBACK WE
GOT FROM

[Captioner] 20:33:50
 STAKEHOLDERS, IT BASSUNREALISTIC.
BUT OVER ALL WE

[Captioner] 20:33:53
 WANT TO INCREASE
CANOPY.
THE LAST COMMENT I

[Captioner] 20:33:57
 WANTED TO
MAKE IS WITH THE CALFIRE GRANT


[Captioner] 20:34:00
FUNDING WE ARE TO LOOK AT THERE
40-YEAR TOMB LINE SO THAT BASS


[Captioner] 20:34:03
PART OF THE EQUATION, AS WELL,
THIS IS FOR THE LONG-TERM SO


[Captioner] 20:34:07
LET'S SEE WHAT IS ATTAINABLE AND
SCALE THAT

[Captioner] 20:34:10
 OVER TIME.
I HONE THAT HELPS WITH

[Captioner] 20:34:14
 THE
QUESTION

[Captioner] 20:34:19
.
>> OKAY.
SECOND, I KNOW THERE

[Captioner] 20:34:22
 WAS A
LITTLE BIT DISCONNECT AT TIMES
DURING

[Captioner] 20:34:26
 THIS INITIAL GRANT WITH
COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS

[Captioner] 20:34:29
 AND WHAT
THEY COULD CONTRIBUTE TO THE
PROCESS VERSUS WHAT

[Captioner] 20:34:32
 CITY STAFF
COULD DO.
SO I'M

[Captioner] 20:34:35
 WONDERING WHAT THE PLANS
ARE GOING FORWARD TO MAKE, YOU
KNOW, TO MAKE

[Captioner] 20:34:39
 SURE IT IS REALLY
CLEAR WHO IS ALLOWED TO DO IT
AND ALSO

[Captioner] 20:34:42
 TO MAKE SURE THERE
AREN'T ANY ISSUES WHERE


[Captioner] 20:34:46
VOLUNTEERS WHO WANT TO VOLUNTEER
TO DO THIS WORK OF

[Captioner] 20:34:49
 GROWING
TREES, PLANTING TREES,
MAINTAINING

[Captioner] 20:34:53
 TREES, ARE NOT
PREVENTED FROM DOING THIS
BECAUSE OF SOME

[Captioner] 20:34:57
 BUREAUCRATIC
REASON OR CONTRACTUAL REASON.
SO I JUST

[Captioner] 20:35:00
 WANTED TO SEE IF THAT
ISSUE HAD BEEN

[Captioner] 20:35:04
 ADDRESSED.
>> WE HAVE THREE CONTRACTS FROM
THE SECOND DOCTOR

[Captioner] 20:35:07
 ALFIRE GRANT
AND WE WILL BE WORKING THROUGH
THOSE CLOSELY WITH THOSE


[Captioner] 20:35:11
STAKEHOLDERS.
WE JUST HAD THAT

[Captioner] 20:35:16
 CONVERSATION
DURING THIS TIME BETWEEN THE
ACCEPTANCE OF THE

[Captioner] 20:35:20
 PROCLAMATION
AND NOW

[Captioner] 20:35:25
.
IT IS OUR INTENT TO REALLY WORK


[Captioner] 20:35:28
CLOSELY WITH STAKEHOLDERS AND
VOLUNTEERS AND

[Captioner] 20:35:32
 THINK ABOUT WAYS
WE CAN GROW THIS

[Captioner] 20:35:35
 INITIATIVE AND
OUR LOVE OF TREES

[Captioner] 20:35:38
 AND ARBOR IN
THIS CITY THAT WE ARE AND

[Captioner] 20:35:41
 THAT
TAKES GROWING PINS AND NOT ONLY
THE CITY BUT

[Captioner] 20:35:45
 OUR PARTNERS AND
THEY'VE

[Captioner] 20:35:48
 BAN GREAT PARTNERSHIP WE
WANT TO

[Captioner] 20:35:53
 GROW

[Captioner] 20:36:03
.
>> Councilmember Kassan: OKAY, I
DIDN'T HEAR AN ANSWER TO THE


[Captioner] 20:36:06
QUESTION, FOLKS WANTED TO
CONTRIBUTE AND WERE TOLD THEY


[Captioner] 20:36:09
COULDN'T SO IS ANYTHING GOING TO
CHANGE FROM WHAT HAPPENED

[Captioner] 20:36:12
 UNTIL
NOW GOING FORWARD TO PREVENT
THOSE KINDS

[Captioner] 20:36:16
 OF DISCONNECTS FROM


[Captioner] 20:36:19
HAPPENING.
>> I THINK JUST SAY WE ARE

[Captioner] 20:36:22

HIRING A NEW URBAN FOREST
MANAGER AND

[Captioner] 20:36:25
 IN THAT PROCESS WE
WILL HAVE A DIRECT CONNECTION
FOR

[Captioner] 20:36:28
 INDIVIDUALS.
RIGHT NOW WE HAVE A LOT OF IT
SPREAD THROUGHOUT OUR


[Captioner] 20:36:32
ORGANIZATION WHERE THEY'RE
TALKING TO THREE TO FOUR PEOPLE
AND THAT

[Captioner] 20:36:35
 MAY BE FRUSTRATING AND
I CAN

[Captioner] 20:36:38
 ACKNOWLEDGE THAT FOR OUR
ORGANIZATION.
PEOPLE HAVE A

[Captioner] 20:36:42
 DIRECT CONNECTION
TO ME

[Captioner] 20:36:45
 TO CALL ME IF THERE IS AN
TISSUE DIRECT.
AS

[Captioner] 20:36:48
 THE NEW MANAGER COME TOES ON,
THERE WILL BE

[Captioner] 20:36:51
 SOMEONE FOCUSED

[Captioner] 20:36:55
 ON
THAT CONNECTION WITH

[Captioner] 20:36:58
 THE
COMMUNITY

[Captioner] 20:37:05
.
>> Councilmember Kassan: THEY
MAY BE RESPONSIBLE FOR GENERAL


[Captioner] 20:37:09
FOREST AND URBAN DUTIES SO WHAT


[Captioner] 20:37:12
IS HAVING ONE PERSON WITH THE
SOLE JOB TO MANAGE THIS

[Captioner] 20:37:16
 URBAN
FORESTRY GRANT AND BE SOLELY


[Captioner] 20:37:19
FOCUSED ON THAT AND NOT BE
CALLED OUT FOR

[Captioner] 20:37:23
 GENERAL ARBORIST
DUTIES.


[Captioner] 20:37:27
>> THE GOAL

[Captioner] 20:37:30
 IS TO REALLY

[Captioner] 20:37:36
 FIND
WAYS TO BE CREATIVE WITH THE
STAFF WE

[Captioner] 20:37:38
 HAVE.
FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE STORM
PROCESS, WE HAVE MANY OF OUR


[Captioner] 20:37:42
STAFF, ALL OF OUR PARK STAFF,
MANY STAFF

[Captioner] 20:37:45
 WORKING ON TREE
ISSUES AT THAT TIME.
WE HAVE A VARIETY OF FOLKS

[Captioner] 20:37:49

WORKING ON URBAN FOREST ISSUES
AT ANY TIME IN

[Captioner] 20:37:52
 OUR ORGANIZATION,
SO THE GOAL IS TO REALLY MEET
THE OUTCOMES

[Captioner] 20:37:55
 AND OBJECTIVES OF
OUR PROGRAM AND MAKING SURE
THOSE ARE

[Captioner] 20:37:59
 ACHIEVED.
OUR COMMITMENT IS TO MAKING SURE
WE MEET THOSE

[Captioner] 20:38:02
 OUTCOMES AND
OBJECTIVES AND I THINK OUR
STAFFING PLAN WE

[Captioner] 20:38:06
 HAVE MOVING
FORWARD WILL MEET THOSE
OBJECTIVES

[Captioner] 20:38:11
 EFFECTIVELY.
>> Councilmember Kassan: SO DOES
THAT PLANE

[Captioner] 20:38:14
 THERE WILL NOT BE A
PERSON WHOSE FULL TIME DUTY WILL


[Captioner] 20:38:18
BE TO MANAGE THIS GRANT AND BE
IN CHARGE OF OUR

[Captioner] 20:38:21
 URBAN FORESTRY
MANAGEMENT PLAN.
>> IN THE GRANT THERE BASS

[Captioner] 20:38:24
 NEVER
-- WHEN WE PROPOSED THE GRANT
THERE WAS

[Captioner] 20:38:28
 NEVER AN INTENT TO
HAVE A

[Captioner] 20:38:31
 SEPARATE PERSON TO MANAGE
THE GRANT BUT THERE IS A CURRENT


[Captioner] 20:38:34
ARBORIST TO MANAGE THE 50/50
PROGRAM AND WE WILL HIRE AN


[Captioner] 20:38:38
URBAN FOREST MANAGER WITH THOSE
TWO POSITIONS WE

[Captioner] 20:38:41
 BELIEVE WE WILL
BE SUCCESSFUL WITH OUR STAFF,
THE

[Captioner] 20:38:44
 FOLKS I MENTIONED IN THE
AUDIENCE THIS EVENING AS WELL

[Captioner] 20:38:47
 AS
OTHERS PARK SYSTEM

[Captioner] 20:38:51
 HAVE ABOUT
THE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN WORKING
THROUGH

[Captioner] 20:38:55
 THE ISSUES AND WE ARE
COMMITTED TO

[Captioner] 20:38:59
 CONTINUING THAT.


[Captioner] 20:39:04
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
IS THAT THE LAST QUESTION,


[Captioner] 20:39:07
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN OKAY, THANK
YOU.
NEXT FOR CLARIFYING

[Captioner] 20:39:10
 QUESTIONS,
COUNCILMEMBER KENG.
>> Councilmember Keng: THANK


[Captioner] 20:39:14
YOU, MADAM MAYOR.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR

[Captioner] 20:39:17
 THAT
PRESENTATION.
I HAVE A COUPLE OF

[Captioner] 20:39:20
 QUESTIONS.


[Captioner] 20:39:28
S WE WILL SEE THE IMPROVEMENT WE
HAVE BEEN MAKING AS

[Captioner] 20:39:31
 A COME TO
PARSON?


[Captioner] 20:39:35
GO AHEAD.
>> YEAH, SO WE LOOKED AT THE
PAST

[Captioner] 20:39:38
 AND HISTORICAL RECORDS TO
WHAT WAS RECORDED TO

[Captioner] 20:39:42
 ARBOR DAY
FOUNDATION UNTIL TREE

[Captioner] 20:39:45
 CITY USA
ACCREDITATION AND I HAVE TO LOOK
BACK AT THE

[Captioner] 20:39:48
 NUMBERS AGAIN AND I
WILL SAY IN THE EARLY STAGES OF


[Captioner] 20:39:51
PLANTING TO REACH THE CANOPY
GOAL IT

[Captioner] 20:39:54
 IS 800 TREES PER YEAR
AND THAT IS SLIGHTLY

[Captioner] 20:39:57
 INCREASED
FROM WHAT WAS REPORTED FOR

[Captioner] 20:40:00
 TREE
CITY USA.
NOW THERE DIFFERENT WAYS HOW

[Captioner] 20:40:04
 YOU
REPORT TREE PLANTINGS.
THERE ARE THE STREET

[Captioner] 20:40:07
 PLANTING
PROJECTS.
PLANTINGS BY PARTNERS.


[Captioner] 20:40:11
PLANTINGS BY DEVELOPMENT
PROJECTS.
BUT WE ARE LOOKING

[Captioner] 20:40:15
 SOLELY AT THE
STREET FLINTINGS AND THAT WAS


[Captioner] 20:40:19
SOMEWHERE -- STREET PLANTING
PROJECTS AND THAT WAS SOMEWHERE


[Captioner] 20:40:23
OVER 500 TREES AND GO UP FROM
THAT.
GOING

[Captioner] 20:40:26
 BACK TO THE OTHER
QUESTION, WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT
OTHER REPORTING OF TREES

[Captioner] 20:40:30
 BEING
PLANTED, THERE ARE CASES WHERE
THE CITY IS

[Captioner] 20:40:33
 ALREADY PLANTING
MORE THAN WHAT IS OUTLINED IN
THOSE INITIAL

[Captioner] 20:40:36
 PHASES OF THE
PLANTING FOR THE

[Captioner] 20:40:40
 CANOPY GOAL.
>> THANK YOU.
AND THEN, SO

[Captioner] 20:40:43
 THE 800 TREES BEING
PLANNED

[Captioner] 20:40:46
 TO BE PLANTED ANNUALLY,
HOW

[Captioner] 20:40:49
 FAR INTO OUR INCOMING PLAN
IS THAT GOING TO BE

[Captioner] 20:40:53
 IMPLEMENTED?
>>

[Captioner] 20:40:56
 SO AGAIN, WHEN WE LOOK AT ALL
OF THE TREES BEING PLANTED AND


[Captioner] 20:41:00
THE CITY IS A PORTION OF THAT
PLANTING, LAST YEAR WE

[Captioner] 20:41:03
 PLANTED
OVER 1,000 TREES IN TOTAL AND SO
OUR

[Captioner] 20:41:06
 GOAL IS TO EXCEED OR MEET OR
EXCEED THE

[Captioner] 20:41:10
 GOALS WE SET.
AGAIN THAT REALLY DOES INCLUDE
OUR

[Captioner] 20:41:13
 COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS AND
STAKEHOLDERS TO GROW THAT
EDUCATION

[Captioner] 20:41:16
 ALLEGATION VALUE SO WE
CANNED A --

[Captioner] 20:41:20
 EDUCATIONAL VALUE SO
WE CAN ADD THAT OVER TIME.
THE CITY

[Captioner] 20:41:23
 IS A PORTION OF THAT
OVER ALL GOAL.
>> THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:41:26
MY LAST QUESTION IS THAT I KNOW
WE

[Captioner] 20:41:29
 OFTEN RECEIVE A LOT OF
REQUESTS OR, YOU

[Captioner] 20:41:32
 KNOW, QUESTIONS
REGARDING LIKE PEOPLE ARE STILL
NOT

[Captioner] 20:41:36
 FULLY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE
STREET TREES

[Captioner] 20:41:39
 ARE HALF OF -- ARE
THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES.


[Captioner] 20:41:42
IS THERE ANY FUNDING THAT

[Captioner] 20:41:45
 WE
HAVE ALLOTTED TO HEN

[Captioner] 20:41:49
 HELP THOSE WHO


[Captioner] 20:41:52
MAY HAVE FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES
TO MAINTAINING THEIR TREES.
>>

[Captioner] 20:41:55
 WE CURRENTLY HAVE A 50/50
PROGRAM, WHICH WE

[Captioner] 20:41:58
 CURRENTLY HAVE
TODAY.
AGAIN, AS WE LOOK THROUGH OUR


[Captioner] 20:42:01
ORDINANCES IN MOVING FORWARD WE
CAN ALWAYS EVALUATE WHERE WE ARE


[Captioner] 20:42:05
FOR ADDITION ALLEGATION STRESS
ON INDIVIDUALS OR FAMILIES

[Captioner] 20:42:08
 BUT
CURRENTLY WE HAVE A 50/50
PROGRAM TO SUPPORT

[Captioner] 20:42:11
 FAMILIES THAT
WOULD LIKE TO RECEIVE 50% CREDIT


[Captioner] 20:42:14
TOWARDS THEIR STREET

[Captioner] 20:42:17
 TREES.
>> GOT IT.
SO I BASS

[Captioner] 20:42:21
 WAS ASKING PEOPLE WHO NEED


[Captioner] 20:42:25
ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL HELP.
EVEN WITH THE 50/50 IT IS STILL


[Captioner] 20:42:29
A SIGNIFICANT EXPENSE THAT
PEOPLE HAVE TO,

[Captioner] 20:42:33
 YOU KNOW, SPEND.
SO IF WE HAVE

[Captioner] 20:42:36
 THOSE AVAILABLE
FOR THE PEOPLE WHO ARE, YOU
KNOW,

[Captioner] 20:42:39
 LOWER INCOME OR HAVE A
HARD

[Captioner] 20:42:43
 TIME PAYING THAT FEE TO


[Captioner] 20:42:46
MAINTAIN THEIR TREE, I THINK IT
WOULD BE VERY

[Captioner] 20:42:50
 HELPFUL.
THANK YOU.
>>

[Captioner] 20:42:53
 THANK YOU FOR CLARIFYING
QUESTIONS.
NEXT,

[Captioner] 20:42:56
 DOCUMENT COX, OR VICE
MAYOR COX.


[Captioner] 20:43:00
>> Councilmember Cox: THANK YOU
FOR THE PRESENTATION.
I LIKE

[Captioner] 20:43:03
 SEEING ALL THAT GREEN.
GREENER WAY.


[Captioner] 20:43:06
I DID HAVE A COUPLE OF
QUESTIONS.
ONE

[Captioner] 20:43:10
 IS, YOU MENTIONED ABOUT 
EX33rd INDICTING THE

[Captioner] 20:43:13
 HIRING OF
THE YOU ARE -- EXPEDITING

[Captioner] 20:43:16
 OF
HIRING THE URBAN

[Captioner] 20:43:19
 POSITION.
ARE YOU IN THE FINAL STAGES IS
WHAT I'M HEARING WITH

[Captioner] 20:43:23
 THE
CANDIDATES AND WILL THAT
POSITION BE

[Captioner] 20:43:26
 SUPPORTED OR
SUPPLEMENTED WITH THE GRANT OR
IS THAT FULL TIME ON

[Captioner] 20:43:29
 THE BUDGET
OF THE CITY OF FREMONT.
>> THE URBAN

[Captioner] 20:43:33
 FOREST MANAGES THE


[Captioner] 20:43:36
FULL TIME POSITION THAT IS
FUNDED AND WE ARE IN THE HIRE


[Captioner] 20:43:39
PROCESS NOW.
>> WHEN WILL THAT CLOSE OR

[Captioner] 20:43:42
 HOW
CAN WE GET THE WORD OUT TO GET


[Captioner] 20:43:46
CANDIDATES?
>> THE POSITION HAS CLOSED AND
WE'RE IN THE BEGINNING

[Captioner] 20:43:48
 OF THE
INTERVIEW PROCESS.
>> OKAY.


[Captioner] 20:43:50
JUST WANTED TO DOUBLE CHECK ON
THAT.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:43:53
THE OTHER PART, AS WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT THE

[Captioner] 20:43:57
 HITTING THE MAGIC
NUMBER, BECAUSE WE'VE GOT A
SCORE

[Captioner] 20:44:00
 OF 72 OUT OF 100 AND THE
RATING FOR OUR

[Captioner] 20:44:04
 TREE SCORE, AND
WOULD LIKE TO TRY TO GET INTO
THAT, MOVE INTO

[Captioner] 20:44:08
 A HIGHER RANGE.
AND THE NUMBER IS ONLY

[Captioner] 20:44:11
 BASED ON
PUBLIC TREES, BUT COULD

[Captioner] 20:44:14
 IT BE
POSSIBLE, AND I'M NOT

[Captioner] 20:44:18
 SURE WHAT
THE FORMULA IS, IS IT POSSIBLE


[Captioner] 20:44:21
THAT WE COULD HAVE AN EXTENSION


[Captioner] 20:44:24
OF THE WEBSITE THAT HAS PEOPLE
PLANT, IF THEY WERE ALLOWED

[Captioner] 20:44:27
 THE
PRIVATE OWNED TREE THAT PEOPLE
WOULD BE ABLE TO

[Captioner] 20:44:31
 INPUT THEY
PLANTED SOME TREES IN THE YARD
TO BE ABLE

[Captioner] 20:44:34
 TO INCREASE HOW MANY
MORE TREES AND COUNTING TOWARDS


[Captioner] 20:44:37
THE CANOPY.
IS THAT ANYTHING THAT COULD BE
THOUGHT ABOUT IN

[Captioner] 20:44:41
 ALLOWING US TO
IMPROVE OUR SCORE BUT ALSO


[Captioner] 20:44:44
ALLOWING EVERY DAY, YOU KNOW,
WHETHER IT IS STUDENTS, WHETHER


[Captioner] 20:44:47
IT'S FAMILIES, INDIVIDUALS,


[Captioner] 20:44:50
GROUPS, ORGANIZATIONS, TO BE
ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN

[Captioner] 20:44:54
 THAT.
I MEAN I'M JUST THINKING ABOUT
IT WITH

[Captioner] 20:44:57
 YOUR FORMULA.
SOUNDED LIKE IT

[Captioner] 20:45:00
 IS ONLY PUBLIC
STREET BUT DO WE INCLUDE MORE TO


[Captioner] 20:45:03
EXPAND THE OPTIONS THERE?
>>

[Captioner] 20:45:06
 SO, ONE THING TO NOTE IS
THERE IS A SCORE OF 72

[Captioner] 20:45:10
 OUT OF
100 FOR THE TREE EQUITY SCORE


[Captioner] 20:45:13
REPORT, AND THAT LOOKS AT CANOPY


[Captioner] 20:45:17
COVER AND SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC DATA
AS WELL

[Captioner] 20:45:20
 AS SURFACE TEMPERATURES,
AND THESE PLANTING

[Captioner] 20:45:23
 EFFORTS ARE
SUPPORTING INCREASING TREE


[Captioner] 20:45:26
EQUITY BY DIFFERENT CENSUS BLOCK
GROUPS.
SO

[Captioner] 20:45:29
 THE IDEA IS THOSE PLANTING
NUMBERS OVER THE 40-YEAR PERIOD


[Captioner] 20:45:33
ALIGN WITH ADDRESSING TREE
EQUITY ACROSS THE CITY.


[Captioner] 20:45:37
AND, BY USING THAT CANOPY TOOL
THAT I

[Captioner] 20:45:40
 SHOWED WITH THE
PRESENTATION, YOU CAN LOOK AT
THOSE LOW TREE

[Captioner] 20:45:44
 EQUITY AREAS AND
THEN THAT'S WHERE PERHAPS, YOU
KNOW,

[Captioner] 20:45:48
 ADDITIONAL 

[Captioner] 20:45:54
 EDUCATION,
INCREASED PLANTING

[Captioner] 20:45:57
 TO INCREASE
TREE EQUITY.
THE ANSWER TO

[Captioner] 20:46:00
 THE SECOND PART OF


[Captioner] 20:46:03
YOUR QUESTION IS THE TREE
PLOTTER, A TON OF

[Captioner] 20:46:07
 FEATURES IN
THAT TOOL THAT ARE ALREADY SET
UP FOR THOSE

[Captioner] 20:46:10
 OPPORTUNITIES LIKE
YOU DESCRIBE.
THERE IS A TOOL FOR

[Captioner] 20:46:13
 REGISTERING
DOWN THE ROAD IF THE CITY HAS A
FREE TREE

[Captioner] 20:46:16
 GIVE AWAY PROGRAM
WHERE FOLK GO IN, SIGN UP, YOU


[Captioner] 20:46:20
KNOW, THESE ARE JUST FEATURES
THAT ARE IN THE TOOL FOR WHEN
THE

[Captioner] 20:46:23
 CITY IS READY TO LAUNCH
DIFFERENT PROGRAMS LIKE THAT.


[Captioner] 20:46:26
AND THEN THE IDEA IS THAT GOING
BACK TO THAT SHARED

[Captioner] 20:46:29
 COMMITMENT
IS THAT THAT PUBLIC-FACING TOOL


[Captioner] 20:46:33
FOR INVENTORY WOULD BE AN
OPPORTUNITY FOR RESIDENTS TO


[Captioner] 20:46:36
SAY, I PLANTED MY TREE HERE AND
IT IS THIS SPECIES

[Captioner] 20:46:39
 AND I WATERED
IT AND BEING ABLE TO TRACK

[Captioner] 20:46:42
 MORE
OF THIS DATA TO SUPPORT THE CITY
WIDE CANOPY

[Captioner] 20:46:45
 GOAL AND THE TREE
EQUITY SCORE.
>> THANK YOU FOR

[Captioner] 20:46:49
 EXPANDING ON
THAT FEATURE.
I APPRECIATE THAT.


[Captioner] 20:46:52
AND MY ENTREPRENEURSHIP IS
COMING ON NOW,

[Captioner] 20:46:55
 AND YOU KNOW, WE
HAVE ADOPT A HIGHWAY,

[Captioner] 20:46:58
 WHAT ABOUT
ADO NOT A TREE.
AND BE

[Captioner] 20:47:02
 ABLE TO HAVE THAT BEING
MAINTAINED BY SOME OF OUR


[Captioner] 20:47:05
COMMUNITY PARTNERS OR, YOU KNOW,


[Captioner] 20:47:08
COMPANIES, PRIVATE, PUBLIC,

[Captioner] 20:47:09
 YOU
KNOW THAT WOULD BE INTERESTED IN
THAT.


[Captioner] 20:47:13
SO I JUST THOUGHT I WOULD START
ADOPT A TREE

[Captioner] 20:47:16
 CAMPAIGN, IF THAT
WOULD BE ACCEPTABLE.
BUT A PROGRAM

[Captioner] 20:47:19
 THAT BOO SUPPORT
US IN INCREASING MORE

[Captioner] 20:47:23
 TREES IF
OTHER PLACES THAT WOULD ALLOW US
TO TAKE THE

[Captioner] 20:47:26
 BURDEN OF THE TREE
MAINTENANCE OFF OF US.
SO IT IS

[Captioner] 20:47:29
 JUST A THOUGHT.
I'M JUST PLANTING IT

[Captioner] 20:47:32
 OUT THERE.
ALSO, I WANTED TO JUST

[Captioner] 20:47:36
 MENTION,
I'M IN FULL SUPPORT OF YOUR

[Captioner] 20:47:39

PLAN, AND I WANTED TO MENTION
THAT THERE'S BEEN A LOT

[Captioner] 20:47:42
 OF
STUDIES ALSO, I KNOW YOU
PROBABLY ALREADY

[Captioner] 20:47:45
 KNOW THIS, BUT
FOR THOSE THAT DO NOT, THE


[Captioner] 20:47:48
AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL
ASSOCIATION DID AN ARGUE ON


[Captioner] 20:47:51
GREEN IS GOOD FOR YOU -- ARTICLE
ON GREEN

[Captioner] 20:47:55
 IS GOOD FOR YOU AND
THEY TALK ABOUT THE RESULTINGS
OF BOTH CHILDREN AND

[Captioner] 20:47:58
 ADULTS THAT
HAVE SHOWN REDUCED STRESS

[Captioner] 20:48:02

LEVELS, MORE HEALTHY LIVING AND
THEY SAID IT IS

[Captioner] 20:48:05
 ATTAINED BY JUST
LOOKING OUTSIDE THE WINDOW WITH
MORE

[Captioner] 20:48:08
 GREEN THROUGH THE WINDOW
THAT HAS YIELDED A LOT OF

[Captioner] 20:48:11
 HEALTH
BENEFITS.
I KNOW YOU HAD SHOWN THE WHOLE


[Captioner] 20:48:14
CHART OF ALL OF YOUR OTHER, I
DON'T KNOW

[Captioner] 20:48:18
 ABOUT 20 DIFFERENT
BENEFITS WITH GREEN

[Captioner] 20:48:21
 AND TREES,
SO I

[Captioner] 20:48:24
 REALLY WOULD SUPPORT THIS.
AND I WILL HOLD OFF AND

[Captioner] 20:48:27
 BE
WILLING TO MAKE A MOTION ONCE


[Captioner] 20:48:30
EVERYONE HAS MADE THEIR
COMMENTINGS.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:48:33
>> THANK YOU.
NEXT FOR THE COUNCIL

[Captioner] 20:48:36
 CLARIFYING


[Captioner] 20:48:40
QUESTIONS.
COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL.
I WANT TO

[Captioner] 20:48:43
 NOTE, WE HAVE OTHER
COUNCILMEMBERS WITH CLARIFYING
QUESTIONS STILL.


[Captioner] 20:48:46
WE ARE OVER DUE FOR A

[Captioner] 20:48:49
 STENO
CAPTIONER BREAK.
IT HAS BEEN OVER

[Captioner] 20:48:53
 AN HOWEVER AND
A HALF AND THEY NEED A BREAK.
IF WE CAN FINISH THE

[Captioner] 20:48:56
 CLARIFYING
QUESTIONS AND WE HAVE SEVERAL
SPEAKER CARDS FROM

[Captioner] 20:48:59
 THE PUBLIC
BEFORE WE PROCEED.
COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL.


[Captioner] 20:49:04
>> Councilmember Campbell: ONE
QUICK QUESTION.
TWO ACTUALLILY.


[Captioner] 20:49:07
FOR THE 50/50 PLAN, I DIDN'T SEE
WHETHER OR NOT THAT

[Captioner] 20:49:10
 WAS FOR
PLANTING AND PREVENTATIVE
MAINTENANCE OR IS

[Captioner] 20:49:14
 IT JUST FOR


[Captioner] 20:49:19
PLANTING?


[Captioner] 20:49:25
>> THE PROGRAM IS ONE WHERE WE
SUPPORT TREE

[Captioner] 20:49:29
 TRIMMING AND THE
MAINTENANCE OF THE TREE, AND
ALSO IF IT NEEDS TO

[Captioner] 20:49:32
 BE REMOVED
AND REPLACED, IT IS 50% OF

[Captioner] 20:49:35
 THAT,
AS WELL.
IT IS THE WHOLE PROGRAM


[Captioner] 20:49:38
DEPENDING ON THE TREE NEED AND
THAT

[Captioner] 20:49:41
 INDIVIDUAL HOUSE HOLD.
>> Councilmember Campbell: I
SEE.


[Captioner] 20:49:45
AND THEN, FOR THE TREE EQUITY
THAT

[Captioner] 20:49:48
 YOU MENTIONED ACROSS

[Captioner] 20:49:51
 THE
CITY, HOW DO YOU DETERMINE WHERE


[Captioner] 20:49:54
A TREE WOULD NEED TO BE PLACED


[Captioner] 20:49:58
IN SORT OF MORE

[Captioner] 20:50:01
 DENSE PROPERTY,
YOU KNOW, WHERE YOU HAVE LOTS

[Captioner] 20:50:04
 OF
APARTMENTS AND CONDOS AND THOSE
KINDINGS

[Captioner] 20:50:08
 OF THINGS?
>> THAT'S A GREAT

[Captioner] 20:50:11
 QUESTION.
I WILL LET CHRIS ANSWER

[Captioner] 20:50:16
 THAT.
>> THESE STUDIES ARE

[Captioner] 20:50:19
 TOP-DOWN
LOOK TO LOOK AT THE LOW-HANGING


[Captioner] 20:50:22
FRUIT, WHERE DID YOU ALIGN THE
PRIORITIES SO THE CITY

[Captioner] 20:50:25
 CAN
ADDRESS THE HUMAN HEALTH AND
WELL, OR AIR QUALITY

[Captioner] 20:50:28
 AND THEN
YOU NEED THE BOOTS ON THE GROUND
TO LOOK AT

[Captioner] 20:50:32
 NOT JUST WHAT IS
POSSIBLE BUT GOING TO THE NEXT
STEP OF WHAT

[Captioner] 20:50:35
 IS FEASIBLE AND
WHAT IS PREFERABLE.
SO YOU

[Captioner] 20:50:38
 HAVE TO LOOK AT THE
CONSTRAINTS OF A SITE AND

[Captioner] 20:50:41
 START
TO MAKE DECISIONS ON THE TYPES
OF SPECIES AND THAT'S

[Captioner] 20:50:44
 WHERE
FUTURE PLANNING EFFORTS, THERE
ARE RECOMMENDATIONS

[Captioner] 20:50:47
 IN THIS PLAN
TO HAVE THOSE

[Captioner] 20:50:51
 LOCALIZED TREE
PLANTING PLANS BECAUSE YOU CAN'T
JUST MAKE

[Captioner] 20:50:55
 DECISIONS WITH DATA
AND AERIAL IMAGERY, YOU

[Captioner] 20:50:58
 HAVE TO
HAVE THESE STRATEGIC PLANS

[Captioner] 20:51:01
 ON
WHERE TREE CONDITION PLANTED AND
WHERE THE

[Captioner] 20:51:05
 ALIGN PRIORITIES AND
SURVIVE AND

[Captioner] 20:51:08
 THRIVE.


[Captioner] 20:51:18
>> Councilmember Campbell: THANK
YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: 

[Captioner] 20:51:21
CLARIFYING
QUESTIONS, COUNCILMEMBER

[Captioner] 20:51:23
 SALWAN.
>> Councilmember Salwan: THANK
YOU.


[Captioner] 20:51:26
IT A GREAT PRESENTATION IT SEEMS
IT IS

[Captioner] 20:51:29
 A CHANCE TO INCREASE THE
TREE PLANTING LAM ARE

[Captioner] 20:51:32
 WE LOOK AT
FOR STREAMLINING THE PROCESS TO
HAVE MORE

[Captioner] 20:51:36
 HONES AND BUSINESS
OWNERS

[Captioner] 20:51:40
 PLANT TREES.
>>

[Captioner] 20:51:43
 IN THE FIRST, SHORT-TERM, WE
LOOK AT ORDINANCE

[Captioner] 20:51:46
 REVIEWS IN THE
INITIAL PERIOD.
WE'RE FOCUSED ON HE HAD

[Captioner] 20:51:50
 EDUCATION AND
OUT REACH IN THE INITIAL PERIOD


[Captioner] 20:51:54
SO WE BUILD THE STAKEHOLDERS
THAT WILL BUILD THAT UP

[Captioner] 20:51:57
 SWING
FOR PEOPLE WHO WANT TO BUILD

[Captioner] 20:52:01
 AN
EFFORT FOR TREES AND BUILD A
CANOPY THAT REALLY

[Captioner] 20:52:03
 IS STRONG IN
OUR COMMUNITY.
>> THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:52:06
AND THEN THE OTHER I THINK THAT
COME TOES TO

[Captioner] 20:52:10
 MIND, FOR EXAMPLE,
CENTRAL PARK, IT IS A HUGE

[Captioner] 20:52:13
 PARK,
BUT I FEEL THERE IS NOT ENOUGH
TREES ESPECIALLY AT YOU

[Captioner] 20:52:16
 WALK
ACROSS THE LAKE.
I THINK IT WOULD BE A GREAT


[Captioner] 20:52:19
OPPORTUNITY ADD MORE TREES THERE
AND MANY OTHER

[Captioner] 20:52:23
 PARKS WE WILL
PLANTED TREES AT OLD MISSION


[Captioner] 20:52:26
SAN JOSE PARK SO OUR SENIORS AND
FAMILIES CAN GET SOME SHADE

[Captioner] 20:52:29
 AND
BE ABLE TO ENJOY THE GREEN.
SO I

[Captioner] 20:52:32
 WAS WONDERING IF WE'RE
LOOKING AT STRATEGIC GREENING IN


[Captioner] 20:52:36
AREAS, ESPECIALLY OUR PARKS.
>> YEAH.


[Captioner] 20:52:39
SO WITH THE CANOPY ASSESSMENT,
WE LOOK

[Captioner] 20:52:42
 AT THE CANOPY COVER AS
WELL AS THE

[Captioner] 20:52:46
 OPPORTUNITIES FOR
PLANTING TREES AND WE HAVE
DIFFERENT

[Captioner] 20:52:49
 BOUNDARIES AND PARKS
ABOUT ONE OF THE BOUNDARIES SO
WE CAN START

[Captioner] 20:52:53
 TO SEE WHICH PARKS
HAVE THE MOST OPPORTUNITY.
BUT THEN IT GOES

[Captioner] 20:52:56
 BACK TO THAT
STRATEGIC PLANTING PLAN BECAUSE
THERE ARE A VARIETY OF

[Captioner] 20:53:00
 USES FOR
PARKS BUT WE WANT TO

[Captioner] 20:53:02
 SEE WHERE
THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES TO
PROVIDE THAT SHADE.


[Captioner] 20:53:05
AND SO PARKS OFTEN TIMES ARE THE


[Captioner] 20:53:08
GO-TO PLACE TO INCREASE CANOPY
BECAUSE OF THE SPACE, BUT

[Captioner] 20:53:11
 YOU
WANT TO KEEP IN MIND THE
MAINTENANCE

[Captioner] 20:53:15
 REQUIREMENTS, WHAT
THE STAFFING LEVELS ARE
CURRENTLY FOR

[Captioner] 20:53:18
 POST PLANNING DARE
AND

[Captioner] 20:53:21
 LONG-TERM MAINTENANCE SO IT
IS A DECISION PROCESS BUT PARKS
ARE

[Captioner] 20:53:25
 DEFINITELY PART OF THE
PRIORITIZATION FOR PLANTINGS.
>>

[Captioner] 20:53:28
 THANK YOU.
>> I ALSO

[Captioner] 20:53:31
 LIKE TO SHARE THE
ROTARY JUST

[Captioner] 20:53:34
 PLANTED 125 TREES
THIS PAST WEEKEND AT CENTRAL
PARK, AS BILLION.


[Captioner] 20:53:37
>> YOU COULD SAY THAT NUMBER
AGAIN?
>> I THINK IT

[Captioner] 20:53:40
 WAS 125 TREES, IF
I'M NOT MISTAKEN.
>> THE

[Captioner] 20:53:44
 MISSION?
>> IT WAS THE -- THOUGH,

[Captioner] 20:53:47
 IT WAS
THE NILES.
>> IT WAS

[Captioner] 20:53:51
 NILES ROTARY THAT
PLANTED IN CENTRAL PARK

[Captioner] 20:53:54
 THIS
WEEKEND.
I THINK IT WAS 25

[Captioner] 20:53:57
 TREES THEY
PLANTED.
>> 125 IS A LOT IN ONE

[Captioner] 20:54:00
 WEEKEND.
I WAS LIKE, WOW, THEY'RE REALLY


[Captioner] 20:54:04
BUSY.
NEXT IS DOCUMENT

[Captioner] 20:54:06
 SHAO.
>> Councilmember Shao: THANK
YOU, MADAM MAYOR.


[Captioner] 20:54:09
QUICK QUESTION.
WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT


[Captioner] 20:54:13
STREET TREES OR TREES IN A PARK.


[Captioner] 20:54:16
THE FRUIT TREES,

[Captioner] 20:54:19
 DO THEY COUNT
AS TREES?
FOR EXAMPLE, EVERY TIME

[Captioner] 20:54:23
 BY TO
COAST

[Captioner] 20:54:26
 COSTCO AT THIS TIME OF THE
YEAR, THEY HAVE ALL THESE

[Captioner] 20:54:29
 FRUIT
TREES FOR SALE AND I ASSUME

[Captioner] 20:54:32
 THE
LOCAL RESIDENTS WOULD BUY IN
PLANT IN

[Captioner] 20:54:35
 THEIR BACKYARD

[Captioner] 20:54:39
.
ARE THOSE TREES BEING COUNTED?
>> ALL

[Captioner] 20:54:43
 TREES DO COUNT.
A LOT OF NUMBERS AND FIGURES GO
INTO

[Captioner] 20:54:47
 FORECASTING THE CANOPY GOAL
THERE ARE DIFFERENT PERCENTAGES


[Captioner] 20:54:50
APPLIED TO TREES THAT WILL BE
SMART STATURED AT

[Captioner] 20:54:54
 MATURITY,
MEDIUM AND LARGE STATURED AND
THOSE

[Captioner] 20:54:57
 SIZES ARE BASED ON U.S.
FOREST RESEARCH AND

[Captioner] 20:55:00
 WE APPLY
THOSE INPUT SO ALL TREES COUNT


[Captioner] 20:55:03
AND WE ENCOURAGE LARGE CANOPY,


[Captioner] 20:55:06
WHERE THERE IS A SPACE.
ALSO THERE'S OTHER OPPORTUNITIES


[Captioner] 20:55:12
HAVING COMMUNITY FOOD FORESTS,
ORCHARDS AND FRUIT TREES

[Captioner] 20:55:15
 FOR
PRIVATE YARDS,

[Captioner] 20:55:17
 YUP.
>> Councilmember Shao: THANK
YOU.


[Captioner] 20:55:20
>> Mayor Mei: I THINK FOR THE
CLARIFYING QUESTION, I WILL ASK


[Captioner] 20:55:23
ONE QUICK ONE BEFORE WE GO ON
BREAK.
WE'VE BEEN

[Captioner] 20:55:26
 LOOKING AT HOUSES
ELEMENTS AND OTHER INITIATIVE IN
THE

[Captioner] 20:55:30
 OUR COMMUNITY.
ONE WE'RE ENCOURAGING PEOPLE TO


[Captioner] 20:55:33
UTILIZE AND MANY PEOPLE HAD
TAKEN ADVANTAGE IN THE

[Captioner] 20:55:36
 LAST
COUPLE WEEKS OF SOLAR AND HAVE


[Captioner] 20:55:40
YOU TAKEN THAT INTO CONVERSATION
IN TERMS OF THE

[Captioner] 20:55:44
 INTERFERENCE OF
THAT, DEPENDING ON THE

[Captioner] 20:55:46

PLACEMENT.
MANY PEOPLE I'M SEEING THAT


[Captioner] 20:55:49
SPRING UP ALL OVER MY
NEIGHBORHOOD AND OTHER PLACES,


[Captioner] 20:55:52
PEOPLE ARE PUTTING SOLAR ON THE


[Captioner] 20:55:56
ROOFTOPS.
HOW DO WE BALANCE THAT?
OR HAVE YOU HAD ANY

[Captioner] 20:55:59
 COMMENTS
ABOUT THAT FROM PEOPLE?
>> SO THIS OFTEN TIMES

[Captioner] 20:56:02
 DOES COME
UP WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT CANOPY


[Captioner] 20:56:05
GOALINGS AND ONE THING WE LOOK
TO ADDRESS IN THIS PLAN

[Captioner] 20:56:09
 IS TO
LAY OUT RECOMMENDATIONS AND
THESE ARE MORE OF THE

[Captioner] 20:56:12
 LONGER
TERM IS TO EXPLORE POSSIBLE
CHANGES TO

[Captioner] 20:56:16
 DESIGN STANDARDS
10678 THAT'S WHERE YOU GET INTO


[Captioner] 20:56:19
SPECIFICS ABOUT TREE PLACEMENT,
THE DIFFERENT SIZED TREES

[Captioner] 20:56:23
 SO YOU
DON'T CAN COMPETE WITH OTHER
GOALS OF

[Captioner] 20:56:26
 A PROPERTY, LIKE

[Captioner] 20:56:31
 SOLAR.
THERE ARE ALSO RECOMMENDATIONS
WHERE

[Captioner] 20:56:34
 IT LOOKS AT PROPER PRUNING
IN ORDER TO

[Captioner] 20:56:37
 HAVE BOTH, HAVE A
BALANCE OF BOTH CANOPY AND

[Captioner] 20:56:41

SOLAR.
SO WE DIDN'T DIVE INTO

[Captioner] 20:56:44
 SPECIFIC
GUIDANCE AROUND SOLAR AND CANOPY
BUT

[Captioner] 20:56:47
 THERE ARE GENERAL
RECOMMENDATIONS

[Captioner] 20:56:51
 SPECIFICALLY
AROUND LIKE DESIGN STANDARDS,


[Captioner] 20:56:53
EVALUATIONS.
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:56:56
I THINK THAT'S THE LAST OF THE
CLARIFYING

[Captioner] 20:56:59
 QUESTIONS.
I KNOW WE HAVE QUITE A FEW
SPEAKERS OF THIS ITEM AND

[Captioner] 20:57:02
 WE
STILL HAVE ONE MORE ITEM AND
RETURN TO THE OTHER PUBLIC


[Captioner] 20:57:05

[Captioner] 20:57:09
 CAPTIONER HAS BEEN ON QUITE
SOME TIME, I WILL TAKE

[Captioner] 20:57:12

MS. MAYOR?
>> Mayor Mei:   I THINK THIS IS 


[Captioner] 21:09:48
AN AGENDA ITEM SO I'M GOING TO 
MAKE IT TWO MINUTES EACH.
THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 21:09:52

>> HEALTH TREE CAN IF I IS VERY, 
VERY IMPORTANT

[Captioner] 21:09:55
 TO ME.
I HAVE A NICE BEAUTIFUL TREE IN 
FRONT

[Captioner] 21:09:58
 OF MY HOME AND EVERY 
SPRING IT BLOOMS.

[Captioner] 21:10:01

EVERY SUMMER I SEE PINK FLOWERS 
AND

[Captioner] 21:10:05
 EVERY FALL THEY FALL AWAY.
AND THAT TREE PROVIDES SHADE

[Captioner] 21:10:08
 FOR 
CHILDREN WALKING TO SCHOOL, 
PROVIDES A PLACE FOR YOUNG

[Captioner] 21:10:11
 
CHILDREN IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD TO 
PLAY, AND UNDOUBTEDLY

[Captioner] 21:10:14
 PROVIDES A 
COMMUNITY BENEFIT.


[Captioner] 21:10:23
BLUT I KNOW EVERYONE, AS OUR

[Captioner] 21:10:26
 
URBAN FLEFTARY MANAGEMENT PLAN 
TELLS YOU, AND TO PLANT

[Captioner] 21:10:30
 THESE 
TREES EFFECTIVELY, TO PREVENT 
CLIMATE CHANGE

[Captioner] 21:10:33
, INCREASE EQUITY 
AND GIVE OUR NEIGHBORS THE

[Captioner] 21:10:36
 
OPPORTUNITY SIMILAR TO THE ONES 
I HAVE HAD, WE

[Captioner] 21:10:39
 NEED APPROPRIATE 
CITY STAFF DEDICATED TO THIS 
ENDEAVOR

[Captioner] 21:10:42
.
AND TO THAT END,

[Captioner] 21:10:46
 WHILE I URGE A 
YES VOTE ON THE

[Captioner] 21:10:49
 URBAN FORESTRY 
PLAN, I URGE

[Captioner] 21:10:53
 THE HIRING OF TWO

[Captioner] 21:10:58
 
MANAGERS, AS THESE TWO RULES ARE 
DISTINCT AND TOO MUCH

[Captioner] 21:11:01
 FOR ONE 
PERSON TO REASONABLY HANDLE 
THEMSELVES

[Captioner] 21:11:04
 ABOUT I ALSO URGE 
PRUDENT PLANNING, SUCH

[Captioner] 21:11:08
 THAT THE 
CITIZEN FOREST ACADEMY

[Captioner] 21:11:11
 CAN BEGIN 
THIS AUGUST, AND BE UNDERWAY TO

[Captioner] 21:11:13
 
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE 2023 
PLANTING SEASON.


[Captioner] 21:11:17
OUR CITY IT LOOKS IS HEADED

[Captioner] 21:11:20
 IN 
THE RIGHT DIRECTION ON THIS SO 
VOTE YES, AND CONTINUE

[Captioner] 21:11:24
 TO 
IMPROVE FREMONT'S TREE 
MANAGEMENT PLAN,

[Captioner] 21:11:27
 WITH 
APPROPRIATE CITY STAFF, WITH A 
PRUDENT AND

[Captioner] 21:11:32
 FAST CITIZEN FOREST 
ACADEMY

[Captioner] 21:11:35
.
AND WITH OTHER ASSOCIATED

[Captioner] 21:11:38
 
CHANGES THAT I'M SURE MORE 
PEOPLE WILL DESCRIBE.

[Captioner] 21:12:04
 FIRST 
URBAN FORESTRY PLAN TO GUIDE 
POLICY FOR THE NEXT 40

[Captioner] 21:12:07
 YEARS.
A LOT HAS BEEN DONE JUST

[Captioner] 21:12:10
 AT THE 
GROUNDWORK, TO INCREASE

[Captioner] 21:12:13
 CAP BY 
IN FREMONT AND THE PLANTING OF 
TREES IN THE

[Captioner] 21:12:16
 FUTURE.
AS PART OF THE URBAN FOREST 
MANAGEMENT

[Captioner] 21:12:19
 PLAN FRAMEWORK THAT 
YOU ARE APPROVING TODAY ONE OF 
THE FIVE

[Captioner] 21:12:22
 MAJOR GOALS IS TO, 
QUOTE, STRENGTHEN AND

[Captioner] 21:12:25
 ENHANCE

KATHY STEEL SABO.
THANK YOU ALL

[Captioner] 21:13:05
 FOR SUPPORTING THE 
GROWING OF OUR FREMONT TREES AND

[Captioner] 21:13:08
 
SUPPORTING A LUSH AND GREEN 
URBAN FOREST FOR EVERY

[Captioner] 21:13:11
 FREMONT 
NEIGHBORHOOD.
I WISH AN URBAN FOREST WERE FREE 


[Captioner] 21:13:14
BUT AS THE SAYING GOES.
MONEY DOES NOT GROW

[Captioner] 21:13:17
 ON TREES.
SO THE DRAFT SUBURBAN FOREST 
MANAGEMENT

[Captioner] 21:13:21
 PLAN INCLUDES 12 
POSSIBLE SOURCES OF FUNDING AND 
I

[Captioner] 21:13:24
 URGE YOU TO DO THE HARD JOB OF 
EXPLORING THESE SOURCES

[Captioner] 21:13:27
 OF 
FUNDING NOW AND KEEP IN MIND AS 
CHRIS REPORT

[Captioner] 21:13:31
ED TO YOU THAT FOR 
EVERY DOLLAR THE CITY SPENDS

[Captioner] 21:13:34
 WE 
REAP $7.44 IN BENEFITS TO THE 
CITY

[Captioner] 21:13:37
.
AND I WOULD LIKE TO SUPPORT

[Captioner] 21:13:40
 WHAT 
JENNY KASSAN SAID

[Captioner] 21:13:43
 THAT WHY ONLY 
PLANT 800 TREES

[Captioner] 21:13:47
 NOW AND RAMP UP 
OVER 40 YEARS?
WE NEED

[Captioner] 21:13:50
 TO PLANT MANY THOUSANDS 
OF TREES NOW AND KEEP DOING

[Captioner] 21:13:53
 IT 
OVER THE NEXT SEVEN AND A HALF 
YEARS.


[Captioner] 21:13:56
WHY NOW?
WE ARE FACING A CLIMATE

[Captioner] 21:13:59
 CRISIS 
AND WE WON'T SOLVE THE PROBLEM 
OF RISING EARTH

[Captioner] 21:14:02
 TEMPERATURES AND 
IT WILL BE TOO LATE FOR US AND 
OUR CHILDREN

[Captioner] 21:14:04
 AND GRABBED 
CHILDREN.

[Captioner] 21:14:21
 CITY COUNCIL, 
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SUPPORTING 
URBAN FORESTRY.

[Captioner] 21:14:24

YOU VOTED TO MATCH THE

[Captioner] 21:14:28
 FUNDS 
REQUIRED BY CAL FIRE,

[Captioner] 21:14:33
 AND

[Captioner] 21:14:54
 IN 
ORDER TO INCREASE OUR CANOPY 
BEYOND THIS SECOND GRANT

[Captioner] 21:14:57
 IN THE 
YEAR 2025.
WE AGAIN ASK THAT THE

[Captioner] 21:15:01
 CITY 
COUNCIL CONSIDER APPROVING AN 
URBAN FOREST

[Captioner] 21:15:04
ER POSITION THAT IS 
SEPARATE FROM THE CITY ARBOR

[Captioner] 21:15:07
IST 
POSITION THAT SUZANNE'S TALKING 
ABOUT.


[Captioner] 21:15:10
IT'S VERY CONFUSING, I KNOW.

[Captioner] 21:15:13

BUT RIGHT NOW, WE'RE MISSING A 
CITY ARBORIST

[Captioner] 21:15:16
, A CITY AR SIZE, 
ACCORDING

[Captioner] 21:15:20
 TO CHRIS'S WORK WE 
HAVE HAD FOUR OR

[Captioner] 21:15:23
 FIVE MINIMAL 
ARBORISTS FOR OUR CITY OUR SIZE

[Captioner] 21:15:27
.
WE DON'T HAVE ONE RIGHT NOW.
WE HAVE A TEMPORARY, RIGHT, A

[Captioner] 21:15:30
 
TEMPORARY.
NOW THE HIRING OF

[Captioner] 21:15:33
 THIS NEW 
PERSON,

[Captioner] 21:15:36
 AS YOU PROBABLY 
REMEMBER, IS GOING TO BE A 
COMBINATION

[Captioner] 21:15:39
 OF BOTH THE CITY 
ARBORIST AND AN

[Captioner] 21:15:43
 URBAN FOREST 
MANAGER.
AND ONCE AGAIN WE'RE LOOKING

[Captioner] 21:15:46
 AT 
THE GRANT FUNDS, NOT BEING

[Captioner] 21:15:49
 
WISELY SPENT.
THERE'S SO MUCH

[Captioner] 21:15:52
 TO BE DONE.
AND THE FIRST GRANT OBJECTIVES 
ARE STILL

[Captioner] 21:15:56
 TO BE ACCOMPLISHED.
THEY'VE BEEN MOVED INTO THE 
SECOND

[Captioner] 21:15:59
 GRANTS TO BE DONE OVER A 
PERIOD OF YEARS.


[Captioner] 21:16:03
IT IS BE

[Captioner] 21:16:06
 IMPOSSIBLE TO FULLY 
UTILIZE THE GRANT FORCES

[Captioner] 21:16:09
 AND TO 
CONTINUE THE TIME SENSITIVE 
IMPLEMENTATION OF PLANTING

[Captioner] 21:16:12
 
TREES, WHILE THIS POSITION, 
COMBINED POSITION

[Captioner] 21:16:16
 IS ALSO TRYING 
TO DO A FULL TIME ARBORIST

[Captioner] 21:16:19
 
POSITION.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR

FIRST CAME TO

[Captioner] 21:16:47
 CALIFORNIA SOMEONE 
TOLD ME THE BEST TIME TO

[Captioner] 21:16:50
 PLANT A 
TREE WAS 20 YEARS AGO, WE 
CLEARLY CAN'T DO

[Captioner] 21:16:53
 THAT BUT WE'VE 
GOT TO DO IT NOW.
WE'VE GOT

[Captioner] 21:16:56
 PLANS, THE OPEN FOREST

[Captioner] 21:17:00
 
PLANS, STOP PUTTING IT OFF

[Captioner] 21:17:04
, JUST 
DO IT, PLEASE, WHERE THERE'S A 
WILL

[Captioner] 21:17:07
 THERE'S A WAY.
WE CAN COME UP WITH EXECUTION

[Captioner] 21:17:10
 EXCUSES FOR 
NOT DOING IT BUT WE'VE GOT

[Captioner] 21:17:13

FOREST PROJECT.
WHEN YOU WALK THROUGH THE A 


[Captioner] 21:17:28
NEIGHBORHOOD, A STREET A PARK A 
CITY THAT'S FILLED WITH LARGE

[Captioner] 21:17:31
 
MATURE TREES IT PRODUCES A 
REALLY GOOD TRACT OF PLEASING

[Captioner] 21:17:34
 
EFFECT THAT CANNOT BE PRODUCED 
ANY OTHER

[Captioner] 21:17:37
 WAY.
ON THE QUESTION OF GETTING ONLY 
2% INCREASE

[Captioner] 21:17:40
 IN CANOPY OVER 20 
YEARS, WE SHOULD NOTE THAT SOME

[Captioner] 21:17:44
 
OF THE REALLY NICEST LOOKING 
CANOPY PRODUCING TREES

[Captioner] 21:17:47
 CAN TAKE 
30, 50, 70 YEARS TO GET THERE.
SO

[Captioner] 21:17:50
 THE ONLY WAY TO REMEDY THAT 
IS TO START FAST, START

[Captioner] 21:17:53
 BIG, BE 
PATIENT, AND JUST UNDERSTAND 
THAT SOMEONE

[Captioner] 21:17:56
 ELSE IS GOING TO 
GET THE BENEFIT OF THE TREES WE 
PLANT

[Captioner] 21:18:00
.
I ENCOURAGE THE CITY TO FOCUS ON 
PLANT

[Captioner] 21:18:03
INGS OPUBLIC LAND AND ALONG 
STREETS WHERE THE CITY

[Captioner] 21:18:06
 HAS MORE 
INFLUENCE AND IT'S BECAUSE OF 
THAT QUESTION OF WHO GETS THE

[Captioner] 21:18:09
 
BENEFIT.
FOR HOMEOWNERS ESPECIALLY IN 


[Captioner] 21:18:12
THEIR BACKYARDS, THERE'S A VERY 
A

[Captioner] 21:18:15
SYMMETRIC SET OF INCENTIVES.
THEY BENEFIT FOR THEIR NEIGHBORS

[Captioner] 21:18:19
 
TREES ALMOST AS MUCH AS THEY DO 
FOR THEIR OWN.


[Captioner] 21:18:22
THEY BEAR THE COSTS AND HASSLES 
OF

[Captioner] 21:18:25
 THEIR OWN TREES, THEY DROP 
LEAVES IN

[Captioner] 21:18:28
 THE GUTTER, THEY DROP 
LIMBS,

[Captioner] 21:18:31
 THEY SHADE THEIR

[Captioner] 21:18:34
 SOLAR 
PANELS.
THERE IS A TEMPTATION

[Captioner] 21:18:38
 TO CUT 
THEIR TREES.
TO KEEP THAT CONTINUITY AND

[Captioner] 21:18:41
 MAKE 
SURE THEY DO GROW TO THAT SIZE I 
DO THINK IT WOULD BE BEST

[Captioner] 21:18:44
 TO 
FOCUS ON TREES THE CITY HAS MORE

[Captioner] 21:18:46
 
INFLUENCE OVER, STREETS AND ON 
PUBLIC LAND.


[Captioner] 21:18:52
HA, THAT'S --

[Captioner] 21:18:59

>> LIZ AAMES.


[Captioner] 21:19:03
>> GOOD EVENING, I'M LIZ AAMES.

[Captioner] 21:19:06

YOU I'M ON THE BOARD OF

[Captioner] 21:19:10
 TRICITY 
ECOLOGY CENTER

[Captioner] 21:19:13
, I'M HERE TO 
ADVOCATE FOR OUR URBAN FOREST.
AND

[Captioner] 21:19:16
 FOR MANY YEARS OUR CITY HAS 
ENJOYED ROBUST

[Captioner] 21:19:19
 HEALTHY TREE 
CANOPIES THROUGHOUT OUR CITY 
NEIGHBORS

[Captioner] 21:19:24
 
NEIGHBORHOODS AND ALONG OUR CITY 
STREETS.


[Captioner] 21:19:27
HOWEVER WE ARE SEEING THE LONG 
TERM EFFECTS OF HAVING A

[Captioner] 21:19:30
 LOW 
PRIORITY BY THE DECLINE OF OUR 
CITY'S TREES

[Captioner] 21:19:33
 AS REPORTED IN THE 
BAWNDERS FORESTRY MANAGEMENT 
PLAN.

[Captioner] 21:19:36

AND WOULD I SAY THAT WE SHOULD 
BE LOOKING AT PLANT

[Captioner] 21:19:39
ING NATIVES, 
WE SHOULD BE TRYING TO SHADE OUR

[Captioner] 21:19:42
 
HEAT ISLANDS WHICH ARE OUR 
STREETS, OUR STREETS ARE REALLY

[Captioner] 21:19:46
 
HEAT ISLANDS WHERE THE HEAT OF 
THE SUN WARMS UP THE

[Captioner] 21:19:49
 CITY 
TEMPERATURE.
AND SO WE WANT TO CREATE THIS 


[Captioner] 21:19:52
CANOPY.
I WOULD BE FOCUSING A LOT ON 
REDUCING THE

[Captioner] 21:19:56
 HEAT ISLAND EFFECT 
WHICH IS OUR

[Captioner] 21:19:59
 IMPERVIOUS AREAS.
ALL CITIES ARE ENCOUNTER

[Captioner] 21:20:02
ING 
THESE SAME ISSUES.
AND MANY OTHER ISSUES INCLUDING

[Captioner] 21:20:05
 
POLICE, FIRE AND HOMELESSNESS 
AND BUSINESSES RECEIVE

[Captioner] 21:20:08
 THE 
LION'S SHARE OF RESOURCES.
SO IN THIS CASE

[Captioner] 21:20:12
 I'M HOPING WE 
CAN USE THE GRANT FUNDING TO 
SUPPLY FUNDS TO

[Captioner] 21:20:15
 NONPROFITS LIKE 
FOR URBAN FOREST FRIENDS.
OR YOU KNOW

[Captioner] 21:20:18
 THE ROTARY CLUB.
I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF VALUE 
IN OUR

[Captioner] 21:20:22
 NONPROFITS, AND WE CAN 
LEVERAGE

[Captioner] 21:20:25
 THOSE RESOURCES TO 
PLANT, YOU KNOW, ON

[Captioner] 21:20:28
 MAYBE CITY 
STREETS POTENTIALLY AND IN OUR 
PARKS.

[Captioner] 21:20:31

SO I HOPE THAT WE CAN USE THAT 
FUND FOR PLANTING

[Captioner] 21:20:35
 AS OPPOSED TO 
OTHER AREAS.
AND I THINK I HAVE 28 SECONDS

[Captioner] 21:20:36
, 
IS THAT CORRECT?
OKAY.


[Captioner] 21:20:39
SO WE APPLAUD YOU, OUR CURRENT 
CITY COUNCIL

[Captioner] 21:20:42
, FOR INITIATING A 
NEW ERA

[Captioner] 21:20:45
 OF CLIMATE ACTION, ARE 
PACK IMPROVEMENTS AND

[Captioner] 21:20:48
 A 
BIODIVERSE PLANS

[Captioner] 21:20:51
 TO SUPPORT 
URBAN FORESTRY SO THANK YOU,

[Captioner] 21:20:54
 I 
HOPE CAN YOU USE OUR NONPROFITS 
AND PLANT

[Captioner] 21:20:57
 MORE TREES.
THANK YOU.
>> THAT'S THE LAST

[Captioner] 21:21:00
 SPEAKER.
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.
>> THERE'S NO ONE

[Captioner] 21:21:04
 ON ZOOM WHO'S 
RAISED THEIR HANDS TO SPEAK ON

[Captioner] 21:21:06
 
THIS ITEM.
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU SO ARE 


[Captioner] 21:21:09
THERE ANY COMMENTS ON THIS ITEM

[Captioner] 21:21:12
 
FROM THE COUNCIL BEFORE WE MAKE 
ADOPTIONS?


[Captioner] 21:21:15
>> I'M SORRY WE JUST HAD A HAND 
RAISED.

[Captioner] 21:21:18

CHRIS HAMPTON DID YOU RAISE YOUR 
HAND TO SPEAK ON THIS ITEM

[Captioner] 21:21:21
, 
URBAN TREFTARY MANAGEMENT PLAN?

[Captioner] 21:21:25

>> YES.
>> Mayor Mei:   COULD WE CALL 


[Captioner] 21:21:28
THE SPEAKER PLEASE.
>> CHRIS HAMPTON YOUR TIME

[Captioner] 21:21:31
ER IS 
STARTING.
>> I'D LIKE THE CITY COUNCIL

[Captioner] 21:21:35
 TO 
THINK ABOUT THE ARBOR

[Captioner] 21:21:38
IST THEY 
DON'T HAVE.
THIS IS ALREADY COST THEM MONEY 


[Captioner] 21:21:41
BY NOT CUTTING TREES THAT HAVE 
LIMBS THAT FALL ON VEHICLES

[Captioner] 21:21:45
.
THAT CAUSE DAMAGE

[Captioner] 21:21:48
.
ADDITIONALLY, THE CITY RESTRICTS 
WHAT

[Captioner] 21:21:51
 TREES YOU CAN PLANT BY TREE 
LIGHT

[Captioner] 21:21:55
 OR CITY STREET LIGHT.
THE CITY DOESN'T FOLLOW

[Captioner] 21:21:58
 THE 
RULES AND BLOCK

[Captioner] 21:22:03
 LIGHTS IN THE 
STREET.
BUT THEY DON'T WANT TO PUT

[Captioner] 21:22:06
 A 
TREE NEXT TO THEIR STREET LIGHT.
SO THE

[Captioner] 21:22:09
 CITY SHOULD LOOK AT THEIR 
REQUIREMENTS FOR NOT PUTTING 
TREES BY

[Captioner] 21:22:12
 STREET LIGHTS AS THEY 
CONTINUE IF THE CITY COUNCIL 
MEMBERS REALLY

[Captioner] 21:22:15
 WANT MORE TREES 
DONE QUICKLY, THEY SHOULD LOOK

[Captioner] 21:22:18
 
AT WHERE THEY DON'T ALLOW TREES 
TO BE PUT.


[Captioner] 21:22:21
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 21:22:33
>> THAT IS LAST SPEAKER.
>> Mayor Mei:   I'LL CLOSE

[Captioner] 21:22:36

PUBLIC COMMENT ON THIS ITEM AND 
TURN IT BACK TO OUR CITY COUNCIL

[Captioner] 21:22:40

[Captioner] 21:22:46

THE URBAN FOREST

[Captioner] 21:22:50
 MANAGEMENT

[Captioner] 21:22:53

COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL.

[Captioner] 21:22:56

>> Councilmember Campbell:

I WANT US TO

[Captioner] 21:23:05
 HAVE FUN.
I WANT TO COME TO A TREE 
PLANTING PARTY.

[Captioner] 21:23:08

>> Mayor Mei:   YOU CAN JOIN US.
I THINK THERE'S BEEN SOME

[Captioner] 21:23:10
 GOOD 
OPPORTUNITIES.
COUNCILMEMBER KENG, DO YOU HAVE 


[Captioner] 21:23:14
ANOTHER COMMENT?
WE HAVE A MOTION AND SECOND.
BUTTER --

[Captioner] 21:23:17

>> Vice Mayor Keng:   I DID WANT 
TO SHARE, THE SECOND GRANT

[Captioner] 21:23:20
 WE 
GOT, $850, WE'RE TRYING TO 
ALLOCATE IT

[Captioner] 21:23:23
 FOR THE NEXT 40 
YEARS.

[Captioner] 21:23:26

>> NO, THE GRANT IS THROUGH NEXT 
THREE YEAR PERIOD AND

[Captioner] 21:23:29
 WE'RE 
WORKING WITH -- WE

[Captioner] 21:23:33
 WENT YOU 
THROUGH AN RFP PROCESS AND ARE 
NOW PUTTING

[Captioner] 21:23:36
 TOGETHER THE 
CONSULTANT GRANTS FOR THAT WHO 
ARE ALSO WORKING TO

[Captioner] 21:23:39
 STRENGTH BE 
THE COMMUNITY AND WORKING WITH

[Captioner] 21:23:42
 
OUR NONPROFIT PARTNERS AS WELL.
>> Vice Mayor Keng:   GREAT

[Captioner] 21:23:46
, AS 
WE HEARD A LOT OF COMMENTS ABOUT 
THE NEED TO PLANT

[Captioner] 21:23:49
 SOON AND MORE 
SO I THINK IT TAKES TIME FOR 
THOSE TREES

[Captioner] 21:23:53
 TO GROW SO CERTAINLY 
IF WE CAN HAVE

[Captioner] 21:23:56
 MORE TREES, 
TOWARDS THE BEGINNING

[Captioner] 21:23:59
 THERE WILL 
BE MUCH MORE

[Captioner] 21:24:02
 FLAVOR, THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei:   OKAY.
I

[Captioner] 21:24:05
 WAS GOING TO SAY WE HAVE A 
MOTION AND SECOND.
BUT I WANTED TO

[Captioner] 21:24:08
 MAKE A QUICK 
COMMENT BEFORE, I DIDN'T ANSWER 
QUESTIONS

[Captioner] 21:24:11
 BESIDES THAT ONE OTHER 
GENERAL ONE.
FROM THE PERSPECTIVE I GREW

[Captioner] 21:24:14
 UP 
IN PENNSYLVANIA WHICH IS PENN'S 
WOODS SO

[Captioner] 21:24:17
 I TRULY ENJOYED AS A 
CHILD HAVING THE TREES AND THE 
COVERAGE

[Captioner] 21:24:21
 AND PROBABLY WHY ONE OF 
THE REASONS

[Captioner] 21:24:24
 WHY GREEN IS ONE OF 
MY FAVORITE COLORS.
I THINK WHERE WE

[Captioner] 21:24:27
 CAN I'D LOVE TO 
PARTNER WITH THE COMMUNITY.
I KNOW THAT WE

[Captioner] 21:24:30
 HAVE SOME REALLY 
DEDICATED ORGANIZATIONS AND IN 
FACT WITH

[Captioner] 21:24:33
 EARTH DAY COMING UP 
THERE'S GOING TO BE SOME EFFORTS 
IN THAT AREA.

[Captioner] 21:24:37

WHILE I DON'T THINK THERE'S A 
CALL TODAY YET IN TERMS OF

[Captioner] 21:24:40
 AT 
LEAST WHAT I'M HEARING FROM THE 
COUNCIL OTHER THAN

[Captioner] 21:24:43
 ADOPTING THE 
PLAN TO LOOK AT ADDITIONAL 
RESOURCES I'M NOT AGAINST SOME 


[Captioner] 21:24:46
OF THAT IN TERMS OF WHEN WE GO 
THROUGH OUR BUDGET PLANNING

[Captioner] 21:24:50
 TO 
LOOK AT WHAT ARE THE OPTION HE 
IN TERMS OF FOCUSING ON

[Captioner] 21:24:53
 THAT.
IT'S A BALANCE BETWEEN THE TWO.
I THINK WHEN WE HAVE

[Captioner] 21:24:56
 A MORE 
BETTER VIEW FROM THE TOP OF THE 
TREES, IN

[Captioner] 21:24:59
 TERMS OF HOW WE SEE 
OUR BUDGET AND WHERE

[Captioner] 21:25:02
 THAT'S 
FALLING WE'LL HAVE A BETTER IDEA 
OF WHAT WE CAN

[Captioner] 21:25:05
 IMPLY TO THAT.
BUT I ENCOURAGE THAT

[Captioner] 21:25:09
 WE PARTNER, 
I KNOW WE HAVE A LOT OF THE 
CIVIC ORGANIZATIONS WE

[Captioner] 21:25:12
 MENTIONED 
TODAY, WHETHER IT'S ROTARY OR 
OTHER COMMUNITY MEMBERS,

[Captioner] 21:25:15
 I THINK 
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WAS 
REALLY

[Captioner] 21:25:18
 MOVING DURING THE TIME OF 
COVID AND THE LIVES THAT WERE 
LOST,

[Captioner] 21:25:21
 WE HAD PEOPLE DEDICATE AND 
DONATE TREES TO

[Captioner] 21:25:24
 MAKE IT A LIVING 
MEMORIAL FOR THOSE WHOSE LIVES

[Captioner] 21:25:27
 
WERE LOST.
I ENCOURAGE US TO CONTINUE TO DO 


[Captioner] 21:25:31
SO AND I DEFINITELY THINK WE DO 
HAVE SOME CORPORATE PARTNERSHIPS

[Captioner] 21:25:33
 
AS WELL AS OUR STUDENTS 
THEMSELVES.


[Captioner] 21:25:36
HOPEFULLY WHEN WE TALK ABOUT WHO 
WILL BE AROUND TO SEE SOME OF 
THOSE I

[Captioner] 21:25:39
 THINK THAT WOULD BE 
SOMETHING I'D BE 74thIVE OF.
WE

[Captioner] 21:25:42
 HAVE A MOTION AND SECOND.
I DON'T THINK THERE ARE ANY 
OTHER SPEAKERS.

[Captioner] 21:25:44

CAN WE CALL THE VOTE PLEASE.

[Captioner] 21:32:01

COUNCILMEMBER SHAO.
>> Councilmember Shao:   THANK 


[Captioner] 21:32:04
YOU, MADAM MAYOR.
SINCE THE CITY HAS HONORED THIS

[Captioner] 21:32:07
 
MONTH, RECOGNIZED THIS MONTH AS 
THE

[Captioner] 21:32:11
 FAIR HOUSING MONTH, I THINK

[Captioner] 21:32:14
 
IT IS THE PERFECT TIME FOR ME TO 
JUST REPORT

[Captioner] 21:32:17
 WHAT I RECEIVED FROM 
THE

[Captioner] 21:32:22
 LAST MONTHLY MEETING FROM 
THE ALAMEDA COUNTY

[Captioner] 21:32:25
 HOUSING 
AUTHORITY.
AS YOU KNOW, THE

[Captioner] 21:32:28
 HOUSING 
AUTHORITY IS PART OF

[Captioner] 21:32:33
 THE WELFARE 
PROGRAM

[Captioner] 21:32:36
 TO PROVIDE FAIR HOUSING 
TO ALL

[Captioner] 21:32:39
 PEOPLE, ESPECIALLY THE 
SOCIAL ECONOMICALLY

[Captioner] 21:32:44
 CHALLENGED 
AND

[Captioner] 21:32:47
 UNDERADVANTAGED PEOPLE.
AND RIGHT NOW

[Captioner] 21:32:50
, EVERY YEAR, WE 
WOULD

[Captioner] 21:32:54
 RECEIVE FOR THE WHOLE 
COUNTY OF

[Captioner] 21:32:58
 ALAMEDA, ABOUT 7,000 
VOUCHERS

[Captioner] 21:33:01
 FROM THE FEDERAL 
GOVERNMENT.
AMONG WHICH,

[Captioner] 21:33:05
 ABOUT 250 VOUCHERS 
ARE

[Captioner] 21:33:08
 FOR VETERANS.
AND WE ALSO

[Captioner] 21:33:12
 HAVE ABOUT 2

[Captioner] 21:33:15
30 
SO-CALLED PROJECT BASED VOUCHERS

[Captioner] 21:33:18

VOUCHERS.
TO HELP THE HOMELESS GROUP.


[Captioner] 21:33:23
SO IN FREMONT, WE HAVE

[Captioner] 21:33:27
 ABOUT

[Captioner] 21:33:31
 
1240 VOUCHERS BEING USED.


[Captioner] 21:33:36
THE PROGRAM TYPICALLY WOULD 
RECRUIT

[Captioner] 21:33:40
 SECTION 8

[Captioner] 21:33:44
 APARTMENT 
OWNERS AND THEN THE GOVERNMENT

[Captioner] 21:33:47
 
WOULD SUBSIDIZE THE

[Captioner] 21:33:51
 RENT UP TO 
80% OF THE RENT

[Captioner] 21:33:54
 FOR THE TENANTS, 
AS LONG AS THEY

[Captioner] 21:33:57
 QUALIFY FOR THE 
PROGRAM.
AND THEN,

[Captioner] 21:34:00
 USE THOSE SECTION 8 
HOUSING RESOURCE

[Captioner] 21:34:03
S TO HOUSE THOSE 
PEOPLE

[Captioner] 21:34:07
 WHO ARE BASICALLY

[Captioner] 21:34:10
 IN DEEP 
NEED FOR SUCH HELP.

[Captioner] 21:34:14

AND AMONG ALL THE CITIES IN 
ALAMEDA COUNTY, YOU DO

[Captioner] 21:34:17
 THE MATH, 
WE ACTUALLY

[Captioner] 21:34:20
 COUNT FOR MORE THAN 
ONE

[Captioner] 21:34:24
-SIXTH OF ALL THE VOUCHERS 
USED.

[Captioner] 21:34:27

AND IN THE FUTURE WE WILL SEE 
MORE

[Captioner] 21:34:30
 VOUCHERS FOR THE PROJECT-

[Captioner] 21:34:33

PROJECT-BASED VOUCHERS TO BE 
USED IN OUR CITY PROGRAMS LIKE

[Captioner] 21:34:37
 
THE OHLONE

[Captioner] 21:34:50
 HOMEKEY PROJECT.

[Captioner] 21:34:56

FREMONT CAN GET MORE RESOURCES 
FROM THE ALAMEDA COUNTY HOUSING

[Captioner] 21:34:59
 
AUTHORITY.
AS THE REPRESENTATIVE THERE THE 


[Captioner] 21:35:02
CITY OF FREMONT FROM THE HOUSING

[Captioner] 21:35:05
 
COMMISSION, I WILL CONTINUE TO 
SEE THAT NOT

[Captioner] 21:35:09
 ONLY OUR CITY OF 
FREMONT WILL GET OUR FAIR SHARE

[Captioner] 21:35:12
 
OF THE VOUCHERS BUT ALSO OTHER 
FEDERAL

[Captioner] 21:35:15
 OR STATE OR FEDERAL 
SPONSORED PROGRAMS TO HELP

[Captioner] 21:35:19
 US 
HELP THOSE PEOPLE THAT HAVE THE 
HOUSING

[Captioner] 21:35:22
 NEEDS.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.


[Captioner] 21:35:29

[Captioner] 21:35:45
 THAT 
LIVES IN THE EAST BAY, THAT THE

EAST BAY COMMUNITY ENERGY HAS 
PARTNERED WITH A

[Captioner] 21:35:51
TERIA TO PROVIDE 
A CHANCE FOR YOU TO TRY

[Captioner] 21:35:55
 
INDUCTION COOKING.
AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS

[Captioner] 21:35:58
 INDUCTION 
IS THE MOST EFFICIENT COOKING 
TECHNOLOGY

[Captioner] 21:36:01
 THAT'S AVAILABLE 
TODAY.
IT COOKS FOOD

[Captioner] 21:36:04
 FASTER, THAN 
TRADITIONAL STOVES THAT ARE IN 
OUR

[Captioner] 21:36:07
 HOME.
AND IT DOES HAVE THE POWER TO 
MATCH IT

[Captioner] 21:36:10
.
SO BECOME A PROFESSIONAL OR A 
HOME CHEF, YOU

[Captioner] 21:36:14
 COULD APPRECIATE 
GETTING YOUR NEW

[Captioner] 21:36:17
 FREE INDUCTION 
COOKING KIT.

[Captioner] 21:36:20

AND IF YOU GO TO THE

[Captioner] 21:36:23

 IT'S GOOD 
FOR 21 DAYS TO TRY OUT IF YOU 
WOULD LIKE TO

[Captioner] 21:36:38

COOKING.
SO I THOUGHT I'D PASS

[Captioner] 21:36:41
 THAT ALONG 
TO EVERYONE THAT MAY BE 
INTERESTED AND TRYING OUT A

[Captioner] 21:36:44
 NEW 
METHOD.
BUT BE ENERGY EFFICIENT

[Captioner] 21:36:46
.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 21:36:49
AND ALSO THEY HAVE, EVERY 
QUARTER THEY HAVE A RECIPE

[Captioner] 21:36:52
 
COOKING CONTEST.
SO IF YOU ACTUALLY ENTER THAT 


[Captioner] 21:36:55
YOU COULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY 
TO WIN THE INDUCTION STOVE.
SO

[Captioner] 21:36:59
 IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE 
ENCOURAGE EVERY SEASON THEY HAVE 
A DIFFERENT ONE

[Captioner] 21:37:02
.
I'LL QUICKLY REPORT OUT ON 
ALAMEDA COUNTY

[Captioner] 21:37:05
 TRANSPORTATION 
COMMISSION.
WE HAD RAN UPDATE ON SAFE ROUTES

[Captioner] 21:37:08
 
TO SCHOOL.
AND IT'S A PROGRAM THAT THEY 


[Captioner] 21:37:11
VOTED TO CONTINUE.
IT'S ONE OF THE PROGRAMS THAT IS 
REALLY EXPANDED

[Captioner] 21:37:14
 IN THE LAST 
COUPLE OF YEARS.
IT STARTED OFF IN 2018

[Captioner] 21:37:18
, AND THE 
FIRST ROUND WAS 62

[Captioner] 21:37:21
 SCHOOLS AND 
NOW IT'S OVER 132 SCHOOLS AND

[Captioner] 21:37:23
 WE 
PLAN TO ADD ANOTHER 30 NEXT 
YEAR.


[Captioner] 21:37:26
I'M VERY PROUD AND PLEASED TO 
SEE THAT FREMONT HAS THE SECOND

[Captioner] 21:37:29
 
MOST IN TERMS OF A CITY 
PARTICIPATING SCHOOLS IN OUR

[Captioner] 21:37:32
 
SCHOOL DISTRICTS.
WE HAVE OVER 14 SCHOOLS 


[Captioner] 21:37:35
PARTICIPATING.
AND THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE 
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DID

[Captioner] 21:37:39
 IS 
PROVIDE EQUITY AND FOR THE 
STUDENTS WHO DON'T KNOW ABOUT

[Captioner] 21:37:42
 
THIS, THIS IS AN ENCOURAGEMENT 
FOR THOSE WHO ARE

[Captioner] 21:37:45
 ON FREE AND 
REDUCED LUNCH TO GET FREE 
TRANSIT

[Captioner] 21:37:48
 PASSES SO THAT THEY CAN 
UTILIZE BUS PASSES

[Captioner] 21:37:52
 AS WELL AS 
BART.
AND OTHER THINGS

[Captioner] 21:37:55
 THAT WE'RE 
LOOKING AT IS ALSO PARATRANSIT 
WHICH IS

[Captioner] 21:37:58
 VERY IMPORTANT FOR OUR 
COMMUNITY.
IN TERMS OF FUNDING.


[Captioner] 21:38:01
AND THAT WAS THE ALLOCATIONS 
THAT WE'VE UTILIZED FOR

[Captioner] 21:38:05
 EAST BAY 
PARATRANSIT AND CITY BASED 
PARATRANSIT PROGRAMS AND WE

[Captioner] 21:38:08
 HOPE 
TO CONTINUE THAT.
SO THOSE ARE JUST SOME OF THE 


[Captioner] 21:38:11
THINGS THAT WE THINK ARE ALWAYS 
IN SEARCH OF

[Captioner] 21:38:14
 ALSO IS COMMUNITY 
ADVISORY

[Captioner] 21:38:18
 COMMUNITY MEMBERS FOR 
OUR PARATRANSIT AS WELL AS OUR 
BIKE AND PEDESTRIAN

[Captioner] 21:38:21
 PLANS.
SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS.
AND

[Captioner] 21:38:24
 I'LL POST ON THERE HAVE OUR 
CITY SHARE ABOUT THERE'S

[Captioner] 21:38:27
 ACCESS 
ALAMEDA WHICH IS A RESOURCE 
BOOKLET

[Captioner] 21:38:31
 WHICH CAN HELP ABOUT 211 
AND OTHER PUBLIC

[Captioner] 21:38:34
 TRANSPORTATION 
ESPECIALLY FOR ADA.
SO I THINK THAT'S IT.


[Captioner] 21:38:37
WE'LL GO BACK TO NOW OUR PUBLIC 
COMMENTS.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 21:38:43
>> MR. ABREW TURNED IN A SPEAKER 
CARD FOR 2K

[Captioner] 21:38:46
 BUT THE COUNCIL HAD

[Captioner] 21:38:49
 
ALREADY VOTED ON THE CONSENT 
CALENDAR.

[Captioner] 21:38:52

MR. ABREW DO YOU WANT TIME

[Captioner] 21:38:55
 UNDER 
ORAL COMMUNICATIONS SINCE WE'VE 
ALREADY PASSED THAT

[Captioner] 21:38:59
 ITEM?
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
SO

[Captioner] 21:39:02
 THIS IS THE COMPREHENSIVE 
ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT.

[Captioner] 21:39:07

AND IT'S DISAPPOINTING THAT IT'S 
BEEN BURY

[Captioner] 21:39:10
IED SO DEEP THAT NOBODY 
SPENDS ANY TIME LOOKING AT THE

[Captioner] 21:39:13
 
NUMBERS ANYMORE.
AND THERE'S NO SLIDES, THERE'S

[Captioner] 21:39:16
 
NO DISCUSSION OF THE NUMBERS.
AND WHEN YOU DO ASK ABOUT

[Captioner] 21:39:20
 THE 
NUMBERS WHICH DID I SEVERAL 
WEEKS AGO

[Captioner] 21:39:23
, I -- WHICH I DID 
SEVERAL WEEKS

[Captioner] 21:39:26
 AGO.
WHY IS IT THAT THIS REPORT HAS 
22

[Captioner] 21:39:29
,000 PARKING CITATIONS IN 
2021, PARKING AND

[Captioner] 21:39:32
 MOVING 
VIOLATIONS.
AND BY THE WAY ABOUT 60% OF 


[Captioner] 21:39:35
THOSE ARE THE AUTOMATED

[Captioner] 21:39:38
 RED 
LIGHT CAMERAS AT $

[Captioner] 21:39:42
500 APIECE.
THE POLICE REPORT FOR THE

[Captioner] 21:39:45
 SAME 
YEAR, 32,000, THAT'S A 50% IS 
DIFFERENCE

[Captioner] 21:39:48
.
SO WHEN I WRITE THAT TWO

[Captioner] 21:39:51
 YEARS 
ACCOUNTING STAFF, NO'S 

[Captioner] 21:39:54
.
WHY DO YOU HAVE TWO DIFFERENT 
REPORTS?


[Captioner] 21:39:57
IT MIGHT BE A, YOU KNOW, SIMPLE 
EXPLANATION

[Captioner] 21:40:00
 BUT ONE, YOU'RE NOT 
LOOKING AT THE BUDGET NUMBERS, 
YOU'RE NOT

[Captioner] 21:40:03
 LOOKING AT THE 
FINANCIAL REPORT, NOT LOOKING AT 
ANYTHING

[Captioner] 21:40:06
.
AND TWO YOU DON'T ANSWER ANY 
QUESTIONS.

[Captioner] 22:21:23

>> THANK YOU.
>> I USED TO BE A CITIZEN OF 


[Captioner] 22:21:27
FREMONT FEW YEARS AGO.
FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO THANK THE 
CITY COUNCIL AND THE MAYOR

[Captioner] 22:21:30
 FOR 
PASSING THE PROCLAMATION ON 
CONDEMNING

[Captioner] 22:21:33
 HINDUPHOBIA.
SB 403 IS

[Captioner] 22:21:36
 BLATANTLY HINDU PHOBIC 
AND

[Captioner] 22:21:39
 MUST BE CONDEMNED TO THE 
TRASH BIN.
NOTHING SHORT OF

[Captioner] 22:21:42
 THAT WILL 
SUFFICE.
THE OTHER

[Captioner] 22:21:46
 SIDE WAS COMPLAINING 
THAT THE CITY COUNCIL AND THE 
MAYOR OF

[Captioner] 22:21:49
 FREMONT WERE NOT 
LETTING THEM IN, AND

[Captioner] 22:21:52
 BASICALLY 
WHY IS THERE AN OPINION

[Captioner] 22:21:55
 AGAINST 
THE PROCLAMATION THAT WAS 
PASSING

[Captioner] 22:21:59
 AGAINST HINDUPHOBIA.
SENATOR IS

[Captioner] 22:22:02
 DOING EXACTLY THE 
SAME THING.
SHE IS NOT LISTENING

[Captioner] 22:22:05
 TO THE 
PEOPLE WHO OPPOSE SB 403.

[Captioner] 22:22:09

WHEN I FIRST CAME TO THE COUNTRY 
I THOUGHT IT WAS A DEMOCRACY AND

[Captioner] 22:22:12
 
IT WAS RUN BY

[Captioner] 22:22:16
 A CONSTITUTION.
BASED ON FLAWED

[Captioner] 22:22:19
 DATA PASSED BY 
QUALITY LABS.
I HOPE

[Captioner] 22:22:22
 EVERYBODY REALLY GOES 
THROUGH SB 4

S SHOULD BRING 
HARMONY AND PEACE BUT WHAT WE 
ARE

[Captioner] 22:22:44
 SEEING HERE IS THIS 
PROCLAMATION IS NOT DOING THAT.


[Captioner] 22:22:47
IT'S DIVIDING THE COMMUNITY, 
THIS PROCLAMATION

[Captioner] 22:22:50
 SHOULD BE 
TAKEN BACK.


[Captioner] 22:22:54
REGARDING HINDUPHOBIA, THIS IS

[Captioner] 22:22:58
 A 
THUMB THAT IS BEING USED BY THE 
EXTREMIST RIGHT WING HINDU

[Captioner] 22:23:01
 
ORGANIZATIONS IN INDIA

[Captioner] 22:23:05
 TO DEFEND 
THE OTHER

[Captioner] 22:23:08
 CRISES THAT ARE BEING 
COMMITTED AGAINST THE ETHNIC AND 
MINORITIES

[Captioner] 22:23:11

SO THIS HINDUPHOBIA BEING AM

[Captioner] 22:23:14
LY 
FIED BY THE CITY OF FREMONT IS 
NOT A WISE

[Captioner] 22:23:17
 DECISION.
IT SHOULD BE LOOKED BACK AGAIN.
AND AS YOU CAN SEE

[Captioner] 22:23:21
 THIS CASTE 
SYSTEM THIS IS VERY PREVALENT

[Captioner] 22:23:24
 IN 
INDIA AND THIS HAS BEEN BROUGHT 
AS A BAGGAGE

[Captioner] 22:23:27
 HERE AND SB 403 IS

[Captioner] 22:32:16
 FEW 
THINGS THAT REALLY SURPRISED ME

[Captioner] 22:32:20
.
THE RESOLUTION ABOUT WHICH 
PEOPLE

[Captioner] 22:32:24
 SPOKE WAS A CEREMONIAL 
RESOLUTION.

[Captioner] 22:32:27

THERE WAS NO DISCUSSION.
THERE WAS NOTHING.


[Captioner] 22:32:30
WE SAW THAT THERE ARE A

[Captioner] 22:32:33
 LOT OF 
PEOPLE SPEAKING FOR IT, LOT OF

[Captioner] 22:32:36
 
PEOPLE SPEAKING AGAINST IT.
IT WAS NOT PASSED.


[Captioner] 22:32:39
IT WAS JUST READ OUT.
SOMEBODY TALKED ABOUT IT, AND

[Captioner] 22:32:42
 IT 
WAS A CEREMONIALLY PRESENTED.

[Captioner] 22:32:46

SO WHAT IS PASSING?
AND

[Captioner] 22:32:49
 PHOBIA, ANY PHOBIA IS BAD.
YES

[Captioner] 22:32:52
.
PHOBIA AGAINST HIN DUST IS BAD

[Captioner] 22:32:55
.
I'M A HINDU MYSELF.
BUT ANY PHONE YA IS

[Captioner] 22:33:01
 PHONE AWAY IS BAD.
THIS

[Captioner] 22:33:04
 PRESENTATION WHATEVER WAS 
PRESENTED HAD NOTHING TO DID 
WITH

[Captioner] 22:33:08
 SB 403.
LET'S

[Captioner] 22:33:11
 SAY DISSENT.


[Captioner] 22:33:16

HINDUPHOBIA.


[Captioner] 22:33:36
ONE OF THE CITIES THAT HAS THE 
LARGEST ASIAN

[Captioner] 22:33:39
 POPULATION IT IS 
VERY IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THE 
EXISTENCE OF

[Captioner] 22:33:43
 HINDUPHOBIA IN OUR 
COMMUNITY.
THIS

[Captioner] 22:33:46
 PROCLAIMANT DEMONSTRATES 
THE UNIT AND

[Captioner] 22:33:49
 INCLUSIVENESS OF 
OUR CITY AND SHOWED OUR 
RESOLUTION

[Captioner] 22:33:53
 AGAINST HINDUPHOBIA, 
AND AGAINST ANY SORT OF ASIAN

[Captioner] 22:33:56
 
HATE TO SOME EXTENT.
ONE AT A TIME.


[Captioner] 22:33:59
THANK YOU.
[APPLAUSE]


[Captioner] 22:34:12
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU MA'AM.
SO THAT WAS THE LAST OF OUR 
SPEAKERS.


[Captioner] 22:34:15
I JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY AGAIN 
THAT THIS PROCLAMATION DOES

[Captioner] 22:34:18
 NOT 
MENTION AND WE AS A COUNCIL

[Captioner] 22:34:22
 DO 
NOT GET TO VOTE ON ANY OF THE 
SENATE BILLS, WE

[Captioner] 22:34:25
 HAVE HEARD OUR 
COMMUNITY AND WE ARE

[Captioner] 22:34:28
 ABLE TO 
ISSUE RESOLUTIONS OR 
PROCLAMATIONS THAT

[Captioner] 22:34:31
 FOCUS ONLY ON 
CEREMONIAL IN TERMS OF OUR 
STANCE,

[Captioner] 22:34:34
 AND WE HAVE IN THE PAST 
ALSO

[Captioner] 22:34:38
 BEEN VERY SUPPORTIVE OF ALL 
DIFFERENT FAITHS

[Captioner] 22:34:41
 AND IN 
PARTICULAR WE HAVE THE EFFORTS 
IN TERMS OF UNITED AGAINST HATE

[Captioner] 22:34:44
.
AND THAT'S ONE THAT WE BELIEVE 
IN.


[Captioner] 22:34:47
AND SO I JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY 
FOR PEOPLE THAT

[Captioner] 22:34:50
 WE INDIVIDUALLY 
CAN REACH OUT TO ANY

[Captioner] 22:34:53
 LEGISLATORS 
AND WE SIT ON MANY DIFFERENT 
COMMITTEES

[Captioner] 22:34:57
 AND COMMISSIONS AND 
INDIVIDUALLY, I BELIEVE SOME 
PEOPLE HAVE

[Captioner] 22:35:00
 THEIR OWN POLITICAL 
INCLINATIONS AND REPRESENTATION

[Captioner] 22:35:03
.
BUT WE AS A COUNCIL CANNOT

[Captioner] 22:35:06
 VOTE 
SPECIFICALLY ON ANY OF THE 
LEGISLATIVE BILLS.

[Captioner] 22:35:09

THOSE COME BEFORE THE 
LEGISLATORS THEMSELVES.


[Captioner] 22:35:12
SO THANK YOU SO MUCH.


[Captioner] 22:35:16
[APPLAUSE]
>> Councilmember Kassan:   COULD 
I MAKE

[Captioner] 22:35:19
 A QUICK CLARIFICATION 
COMMENT?
I DO WANT TO SAY THAT I

[Captioner] 22:35:22
 THINK IT 
IS REALLY IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE 
TO KNOW THAT OUR PROCLAMATION

[Captioner] 22:35:25
S 
ARE NOT VOTED ON BY THE COUNTY.
THE COUNCIL DECIDED

[Captioner] 22:35:29
 THAT ANY 
PROCLAMATION THAT WAS DONE WAS

[Captioner] 22:35:31
 
SOLELY AT THE PURVIEW OF THE 
MAYOR.


[Captioner] 22:35:34
THERE IS NO VOTE ON THAT.
SO I JUST WANT TO

[Captioner] 22:35:37
 MAKE SURE 
EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS THAT.
AND I DO HOPE THAT THE

[Captioner] 22:35:40
 MAYOR 
CHOOSES TO CONTINUE TO

[Captioner] 22:35:43
 DO 
PROCLAMATIONS AGAINST HATE AND

[Captioner] 22:35:47
 
DISCRIMINATION FOR ALL GROUPS.
OBVIOUSLY, WE DON'T

[Captioner] 22:35:50
 WANT ANY 
GROUP TO BE DISCRIMINATED 
AGAINST AND

[Captioner] 22:35:53
 I'M VERY, VERY SORRY 
THAT CERTAIN

[Captioner] 22:35:56
 GROUPS FELT THAT 
THIS WAS NOT --

[Captioner] 22:35:59
 THAT THIS WAS A 
NEGATIVE FOR THEM

[Captioner] 22:36:02
.
SO I HOPE WE CAN DO A 
PROCLAMATION THAT

[Captioner] 22:36:05
 MAYBE 
ADDRESSES SOME OF THE OTHER 
ISSUES THAT ARE COMING UP.


[Captioner] 22:36:08
THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei:   WE WILL

[Captioner] 22:36:12
 BE

OTHER COMMENTS, WE THANK

CHILDREN AND SO WITH THAT I'D 
LIKE TO CLOSE THIS MEETING AND
