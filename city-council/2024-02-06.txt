[Captioner] 19:31:03
I'M HERE TONIGHT BECAUSE I WOULD 

[Captioner] 19:31:05
LIKE TO PROVIDE SOME FEEDBACK 

[Captioner] 19:31:06
FOR FREMONT'S HOMELESS RESPONSE 

[Captioner] 19:31:07
PLAN.

[Captioner] 19:31:15
IN 2017, THE ONE TIME

[Captioner] 19:31:17
 HOMELESS 

[Captioner] 19:31:18
COUNT IS 479.

[Captioner] 19:31:30
IN 2018 THE CITY DPLAIRD A 

[Captioner] 19:31:31
HOMELESS CRISIS.

[Captioner] 19:31:35
IN 2019, HOMELESS COUNT WAS 

[Captioner] 19:31:35
608.

[Captioner] 19:31:37
BY 2020, WHICH IS TWO YEARS AGO, 

[Captioner] 19:31:42
THAT NUMBER IS 1026

[Captioner] 19:31:43
.

[Captioner] 19:31:45
THERE WILL BE ANOTHER COUNT THIS 

[Captioner] 19:31:45
YEAR.

[Captioner] 19:31:47
I DON'T THINK ANYBODY EXPECTING 

[Captioner] 19:31:48
THE NUMBER TO GO DOWN.

[Captioner] 19:31:51
EVERYBODY BELIEVE THAT NUMBER 

[Captioner] 19:31:52
PROBABLY IS GOING TO GO UP.

[Captioner] 19:32:00
STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS SPENDING, 

[Captioner] 19:32:03
DEFICIT SPENDING $40 BILLION TO 

[Captioner] 19:32:06
$60 BILLION DEPENDING WHO YOU'RE 

[Captioner] 19:32:07
TALKING TO, OKAY?

[Captioner] 19:32:11
THE CITY WILL NOT HAVE ENOUGH 

[Captioner] 19:32:13
MONEY TO HOUSE OR SERVICE ALL 

[Captioner] 19:32:14
HOMELESS PEOPLE THAT ARE HERE.

[Captioner] 19:32:21
AFTER YOU DECLARE A CRISIS, THE

[Captioner] 19:32:21
 

[Captioner] 19:32:22
CITY COUNCIL AND CITY STAFF HAS 

[Captioner] 19:32:25
BEEN FAILING THE PEOPLE ON OUR 

[Captioner] 19:32:26
STREETS.

[Captioner] 19:32:28
AND PARKS.

[Captioner] 19:32:31
IN LOTS OF DIFFERENT PLACES.

[Captioner] 19:32:33
YOU NEED TO COME OUT WITH A 

[Captioner] 19:32:39
REASONABLE PLAN OKAY?

[Captioner] 19:32:41
AND THE OTHER PLAN IS NOT GOING 

[Captioner] 19:32:43
TO WORK, ZERO CHANCE OF 

[Captioner] 19:32:43
SUCCESS.

[Captioner] 19:32:44
MAYBE YOU SHOULD ASK OUR 

[Captioner] 19:32:46
STUDENTS TO HELP YOU OUT AND DO 

[Captioner] 19:32:48
SOME OF THAT PLANNING.

[Captioner] 19:32:51

[Captioner] 19:32:57
MINDSET AND SET HOW ARE WE

[Captioner] 19:32:58

[Captioner] 19:33:13
>> HELLO, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR 

[Captioner] 19:33:14
GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO 

[Captioner] 19:33:18
PRESENT MY PROBLEM HERE.

[Captioner] 19:33:21
WE LIVE IN THE CITY OF FREMONT 

[Captioner] 19:33:22
THINKING THAT WE ARE GOING TO 

[Captioner] 19:33:24
GIVE AWAY, THINKING THAT WE ARE 

[Captioner] 19:33:25
RESPONSIBLE TAX PAYING CITIZENS 

[Captioner] 19:33:29
OF OUR COUNTRY AND WE ARE LIVING 

[Captioner] 19:33:31
IN THE CITY OF FREMONT, HOPING 

[Captioner] 19:33:33
TO PROVIDE SAFE AND SECURE 

[Captioner] 19:33:35
ENVIRONMENT TO OUR CHILDREN.

[Captioner] 19:33:36
BUT THAT IS NOT WHAT HAS 

[Captioner] 19:33:37
HAPPENED.

[Captioner] 19:33:41
VERY RECENTLY, IN A VERY NEXT TO 

[Captioner] 19:33:43
OUR BACKYARD WE HAD A FIRE 

[Captioner] 19:33:44
SITUATION.

[Captioner] 19:33:46
WE HAD BEEN CALLING THE FIRE 

[Captioner] 19:33:48
DEPARTMENT MULTIPLE TIMES ON 

[Captioner] 19:33:53
DIFFERENT OCCASIONS, AND WE HAD 

[Captioner] 19:33:54
RECEIVED ONLY VERY TEMPORARY 

[Captioner] 19:33:55
SORT OF SOLUTIONS.

[Captioner] 19:33:58
THE HOMELESS ENCAMPMENT WHICH 

[Captioner] 19:34:00
WAS THERE JUST NEXT TO OUR 

[Captioner] 19:34:01
BACKYARD, THEY KIND OF SET FIRE 

[Captioner] 19:34:03
AND ALMOST OUR ENTIRE HOUSE WAS 

[Captioner] 19:34:04
ABOUT TO GET BURNED.

[Captioner] 19:34:07
MY TWO-YEAR-OLD SON WHO IS RIGHT 

[Captioner] 19:34:09
NOW HERE, HE WAS WITH MY IN THAT 

[Captioner] 19:34:10
BUILDING AT THAT MOMENT.

[Captioner] 19:34:14
AND WE HAD TO LITERALLY RUSH

[Captioner] 19:34:14
 

[Captioner] 19:34:16
FROM OUR HOMES NOT TO RETURN ARE 

[Captioner] 19:34:18
FROM THAT PLACE IT WOULD BE 

[Captioner] 19:34:20
INTACT OR IT WOULD BE BURNED 

[Captioner] 19:34:20
DOWN.

[Captioner] 19:34:22
IT WAS SUCH A TERRIFIC AND 

[Captioner] 19:34:24
TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCE FOR OUR 

[Captioner] 19:34:25
ENTIRE FAMILY AND WE DO NOT 

[Captioner] 19:34:28
THINK AS TAX PAYING RESPONSIBLE 

[Captioner] 19:34:30
CITIZENS THIS IS WHAT WE 

[Captioner] 19:34:30
DESERVE.

[Captioner] 19:34:33
WE REALLY, REALLY DESERVE 

[Captioner] 19:34:34
BETTER.

[Captioner] 19:34:36
THIS ENCAMPMENT HAD BECOME SO 

[Captioner] 19:34:38
BAD THAT WHEN WE OPEN OUR 

[Captioner] 19:34:40
WINDOWS IN THE EVENING EITHER 

[Captioner] 19:34:43
SMOKE, WIND, WE CANNOT GO TO THE 

[Captioner] 19:34:43
BACKYARD.

[Captioner] 19:34:46
MY CHILDREN, LIKE OTHERS PUTTING 

[Captioner] 19:34:48
DOWN (INAUDIBLE) LEADING TO THE 

[Captioner] 19:34:48
BACKYARD.

[Captioner] 19:34:50
THERE IS DRUG ABUSE.

[Captioner] 19:34:52
IF WE OPEN THE WINDOWS WE JUST 

[Captioner] 19:34:55
HEAR REALLY BAD LACK, BAD 

[Captioner] 19:34:55
WORDS.

[Captioner] 19:34:57
IN OUR OWN HOUSE WE ARE NOT 

[Captioner] 19:34:57
SAFE.

[Captioner] 19:34:58
WE ARE NOT SECURE.

[Captioner] 19:35:00
WE ARE REALLY GOING THROUGH A 

[Captioner] 19:35:01
VERY TRAUMATIC SITUATION THERE.

[Captioner] 19:35:06
AND I DON'T KNOW HOW THE CITY IS 

[Captioner] 19:35:07
COUNTERING US WITH THAT SORT OF 

[Captioner] 19:35:08
EXPERIENCE.

[Captioner] 19:35:11
THIS IS REALLY, REALLY NOT WHAT 

[Captioner] 19:35:12
WE HOPE WE WOULD HAVE IN THE 

[Captioner] 19:35:12
CITY.

[Captioner] 19:35:32
 

[Captioner] 19:35:34
PLACE RAISE YOUR HAND.

[Captioner] 19:35:38
WE ARE HERE TO RAISE THE 

[Captioner] 19:35:39
CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE SECURITY 

[Captioner] 19:35:42
THAT WE HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH.

[Captioner] 19:35:43
I WAS THERE FOR 20 YEARS.

[Captioner] 19:35:46
WHEN I WAS THERE, THAT MY GARAGE 

[Captioner] 19:35:47
DOOR WAS OPEN ALL NIGHT I HAD NO 

[Captioner] 19:35:48
ISSUES.

[Captioner] 19:35:50
BUT NOW I'M NOT SURE EVEN IF MY 

[Captioner] 19:35:52
HOME IS LOCKED AND I'M GOING OUT 

[Captioner] 19:35:53
SOMEONE WILL COME AND BREAK INTO 

[Captioner] 19:35:54
MY HOME.

[Captioner] 19:35:56
SO I WANT TO ENSURE THAT EVEN 

[Captioner] 19:35:59
THOUGH YOU LET US HOPE WITH THE 

[Captioner] 19:36:00
GATES DIFFERENTLY WE CAN WORK ON 

[Captioner] 19:36:02
THE DETAILS WE ARE HERE TO, YOU 

[Captioner] 19:36:07
KNOW, BELIEVE IN YOU AS I'M SURE

[Captioner] 19:36:07
 

[Captioner] 19:36:08
YOUR RULES AND REGULATIONS HAVE 

[Captioner] 19:36:09
TO BE LIMITED WITH THE 

[Captioner] 19:36:11
REQUIREMENT OF SECURITY OF YOUR 

[Captioner] 19:36:15
CITIZENS WE WANT TO MAKE SURE 

[Captioner] 19:36:17
THAT THE AROUND THE COMMUNITY 

[Captioner] 19:36:19
HAS TO HAVE THE RIGHT LEVEL OF, 

[Captioner] 19:36:21
AS IN THE RIGHT LEVEL OF FENCES, 

[Captioner] 19:36:23
VERY SMALL, PEOPLE CAN JUMP IN 

[Captioner] 19:36:24
AND OUT OF THE COMMUNITY VERY 

[Captioner] 19:36:26
EASILY AND IT IS KIND OF A 

[Captioner] 19:36:28
PRIVATE ROAD, SO HAVING THOSE, 

[Captioner] 19:36:31
YOU KNOW, COUPLE OF THINGS DONE, 

[Captioner] 19:36:34

[Captioner] 19:36:44
SCARY FOR FAMILIES AND LITTLE 

[Captioner] 19:36:45
KIDS.

[Captioner] 19:37:19
TO LISTEN TO OUR CONCERNS.

[Captioner] 19:37:21
AS A LONG TIME RESIDENT OF 

[Captioner] 19:37:24
FREMONT, AS GROWN UP HERE I'VE 

[Captioner] 19:37:25
COME TO TRULY LOVE AND 

[Captioner] 19:37:27
APPRECIATE EVERYTHING THIS CITY 

[Captioner] 19:37:30
HAS TO OFFER ITS RESIDENTS.

[Captioner] 19:37:31
WITH THAT BEING SAID, IT'S ALSO 

[Captioner] 19:37:34
IMPORTANT FOR US TO MAINTAIN AND 

[Captioner] 19:37:36
WORK ON PRESERVING AND ENSURING 

[Captioner] 19:37:37
THAT THE CITY IS ABLE TO 

[Captioner] 19:37:39
CONTINUE TO PROVIDE A SAFE 

[Captioner] 19:37:40
STRUCTURED ENVIRONMENT FOR THE 

[Captioner] 19:37:42
FOLKS THAT LIVE HERE.

[Captioner] 19:37:44
HOMELESSNESS IN FREMONT HAS 

[Captioner] 19:37:46
ALWAYS BEEN THERE HOWEVER 

[Captioner] 19:37:47
RECENTLY IT IS SOMETHING THAT 

[Captioner] 19:37:50
HAS INCREASED AND ALSO BECOME 

[Captioner] 19:37:51
MORE VIOLENT.

[Captioner] 19:37:54
WE HAVE NOTICED AN INCREASE IN 

[Captioner] 19:37:59
VIOLENCE, THEFT, HOMELESS

[Captioner] 19:37:59
 

[Captioner] 19:38:03
DEFECATING IN OUR POOL WHERE 

[Captioner] 19:38:04
PEOPLE GO TO SWIM.

[Captioner] 19:38:06
WHERE I PERSONALLY DO NOT HAVE 

[Captioner] 19:38:08
CHILDREN MYSELF I AM PERSONALLY 

[Captioner] 19:38:10
CONCERNED HOW THIS WILL IMPACT 

[Captioner] 19:38:12
THE SAFETY OF MY FAMILY MY 

[Captioner] 19:38:12
FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS IN THE 

[Captioner] 19:38:14
AREA.

[Captioner] 19:38:16
OUR NEIGHBORHOOD HAS 

[Captioner] 19:38:19
HISTORICALLY BEEN A LOW CRIME 

[Captioner] 19:38:22
RATE, WE LIVE IN AREAS WHERE 

[Captioner] 19:38:23
RESIDENTS NORMALLY GO FOR WALKS 

[Captioner] 19:38:24
ON THEIR OWN.

[Captioner] 19:38:25
HOWEVER IT IS EASILY ACCESSIBLE 

[Captioner] 19:38:27
FOR PEOPLE TO ENTER OUR 

[Captioner] 19:38:27
PREMISES.

[Captioner] 19:38:30
BECAUSE OF THAT WE PUT OUR 

[Captioner] 19:38:32
RESIDENTS AT RISK WHENEVER THEY 

[Captioner] 19:38:33
GO OUTSIDE.

[Captioner] 19:38:34
AS SUCH, IT IS INCREASINGLY 

[Captioner] 19:38:36
IMPORTANT THAT WE FOCUS ON 

[Captioner] 19:38:37
ADDING EXTRA WALLS AROUND OUR 

[Captioner] 19:38:39
NEIGHBORHOOD.

[Captioner] 19:38:42
PROVIDE A FENCE AROUND THE 

[Captioner] 19:38:45
OUTSIDE PERIMETER OF OUR COMPLEX 

[Captioner] 19:38:47
ESPECIALLY WINSLOW TERRACE, 

[Captioner] 19:38:50
ESPECIALLY RELOCATING THE 

[Captioner] 19:38:51
HOMELESS ENCAMPMENT THAT IS 

[Captioner] 19:38:53
WITHIN WALKING DISTANCE FROM OUR 

[Captioner] 19:38:54
NEIGHBORHOOD.

[Captioner] 19:38:56
WE PERSONALLY THINK THAT WILL DO 

[Captioner] 19:38:57
AN IMPACT ON KEEPING OUR 

[Captioner] 19:39:00
RESIDENTS SAFER AND AS I CONTEST 

[Captioner] 19:39:02
ALL THOSE FOLKS FROM HAMPTON 

[Captioner] 19:39:04
PLACE PLEASE RAISE YOUR HANDS 

[Captioner] 19:39:05

I'M ANDREW AND I'M A RESIDENT OF 

[Captioner] 19:39:26
THE HAMPTON PLACE.

[Captioner] 19:39:28
I HAVE BEEN A RESIDENT OF 

[Captioner] 19:39:30
FREMONT FOR LAST DECADE AND I 

[Captioner] 19:39:32
HAVE EVERY INTENTION TO MAKE 

[Captioner] 19:39:34
THIS PLACE MY HOME.

[Captioner] 19:39:36
HOWEVER, MY HOME IS IN CRISIS.

[Captioner] 19:39:37
IT'S NOT SAFE.

[Captioner] 19:39:40
AND I'M HERE TO PLEAD FOR YOUR 

[Captioner] 19:39:40
HELP.

[Captioner] 19:39:42
MY REQUEST FOR YOUR HELP IS 

[Captioner] 19:39:44
REALLY QUITE SIMPLE.

[Captioner] 19:39:45
WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE YOUR 

[Captioner] 19:39:47
APPROVAL TO PUT SOME GATES 

[Captioner] 19:39:50
AROUND OUR COMMUNITY SO THAT OUR 

[Captioner] 19:39:54
STREETS ARE NOT FILLED WITH HOME

[Captioner] 19:39:59
HOMELESS PEOPLE AND CRIMINALS.

[Captioner] 19:40:00
WE HAVE GOOD EVIDENCE TO BELIEVE 

[Captioner] 19:40:02
THIS IS A VIABLE PLAN.

[Captioner] 19:40:03
YOU KNOW, THIS WOULD ACTUALLY 

[Captioner] 19:40:05
DETER PEOPLE FROM DOING CRIMES 

[Captioner] 19:40:07
IN OUR COMMUNITY.

[Captioner] 19:40:09
GOOD EXAMPLE HERE IS THAT A FEW 

[Captioner] 19:40:12
MONTHS AGO, I RECEIVED A 

[Captioner] 19:40:14
DISTRESS CALL FROM MY WIFE WHO 

[Captioner] 19:40:16
HAS SEEN THROUGH HER CAMERA 

[Captioner] 19:40:19
SOMEONE, A BURGLAR IS TRYING TO 

[Captioner] 19:40:20
BREAK INTO OUR HOUSE WITH OUR 

[Captioner] 19:40:21
CHILDREN, OUR CHILDREN WERE 

[Captioner] 19:40:22
INSIDE.

[Captioner] 19:40:25
AND AFTER RUSHING INTO -- BACK 

[Captioner] 19:40:29
INTO MY HOME, I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH

[Captioner] 19:40:29
 

[Captioner] 19:40:32
TO CONFRONT THE BURGLARS, THEY 

[Captioner] 19:40:36
HAD LEFT BY THAT POINT.

[Captioner] 19:40:38
AND THIS IS REALLY QUITE A 

[Captioner] 19:40:40
SERIOUS ISSUE.

[Captioner] 19:40:43
THIS BEING AFFECTING EVERYONE IN 

[Captioner] 19:40:44
OUR COMMUNITY.

[Captioner] 19:40:46
BEHIND ME ARE THE NEIGHBORS AND 

[Captioner] 19:40:48
WE HAVE 70 PEOPLE ATTENDING.

[Captioner] 19:40:50
THIS IS REALLY QUITE A COMMUNITY 

[Captioner] 19:40:51
IN CRISIS.

[Captioner] 19:40:54
WE'RE NOT ASKING FOR SOME FAR 

[Captioner] 19:40:54
FETCHED HELP.

[Captioner] 19:40:56
ALL WE NEED IS GET YOUR APPROVAL 

[Captioner] 19:40:58
IN PUTTING SOME GATES IN THE 

[Captioner] 19:41:00
FRONT AND THE BACK ENTRANCE TO 

[Captioner] 19:41:01

[Captioner] 19:41:24
FREMONT GOT THE SOLSMART 

[Captioner] 19:41:25
PLATINUM AWARD.

[Captioner] 19:41:27
I WISH ONE DAY FREMONT THIS IS 

[Captioner] 19:41:31
THE SAFEST CITY IN THE NATION.

[Captioner] 19:41:31
[APPLAUSE]

[Captioner] 19:41:37
>> BUT TODAY THIS BASED ON OUR 

[Captioner] 19:41:38
EXPERIENCES IS NOT THAT.

[Captioner] 19:41:41
WE ARE REALLY A VERY SCARY PLACE 

[Captioner] 19:41:42
THAT WE ARE LIVING IN.

[Captioner] 19:41:44
THIS IS NOT AT ALL SAFETY.

[Captioner] 19:41:46
MY KIDS ARE -- MY KIDS CANNOT 

[Captioner] 19:41:50
COME OUT AFTER 6 P.M. EVERY 

[Captioner] 19:41:50
DAY.

[Captioner] 19:41:53
WE BOUGHT MORE THAN A $1 MILLION 

[Captioner] 19:41:53
HOUSE.

[Captioner] 19:41:57
WE CANNOT COME OUT AFTER 6 P.M.

[Captioner] 19:41:59
LAST MONTH MY NEIGHBOR HER HOUSE 

[Captioner] 19:42:03
GOT BROKEN INTO AT 6:30 P.M.

[Captioner] 19:42:05
I CALLED THE POLICE AND POLICE 

[Captioner] 19:42:06

[Captioner] 19:42:09
THERE CANNOT BE ANYTHING, CAMERA 

[Captioner] 19:42:11
EVERYTHING, THOSE GUYS CAME WITH 

[Captioner] 19:42:14
THE FAKE NUMBER PLATE AND IT 

[Captioner] 19:42:15
CAN'T BE ANYTHING, OKAY?

[Captioner] 19:42:17
ALL THE INCIDENTS RECENTLY 

[Captioner] 19:42:20
HAPPEN IS A MAIL THEFT AND ALL 

[Captioner] 19:42:22
PEOPLE ARE COMING WITH THE CARS 

[Captioner] 19:42:24
AND TRUCKS AND THEN THEY DO ALL 

[Captioner] 19:42:26
THE THINGS AND THEN STOLE LOT OF 

[Captioner] 19:42:29
STUFF AND THEN DRIVE AWAY.

[Captioner] 19:42:31
SO I'M RECALLING WHAT OTHER 

[Captioner] 19:42:33
SPEAKERS SAID SO WE NEED GATE IN 

[Captioner] 19:42:34
OUR PRIVATE PROPERTY.

[Captioner] 19:42:35
OKAY?

[Captioner] 19:42:37
SO WE ARE READY TO WORK WITH THE 

[Captioner] 19:42:39
CITY AND FOR THAT OCCUR 

[Captioner] 19:42:40
DOCUMENTATION AND EVERYTHING WE 

[Captioner] 19:42:42
NEED HELP FROM THEM.

[Captioner] 19:42:45
IN ADDITION TO THAT, THE OTHER 

[Captioner] 19:42:46
SPEAKERS THAT SPOKE BEFORE IS 

[Captioner] 19:42:49
HOMELESSNESS, WHICH IS DAILY 

[Captioner] 19:42:52

[Captioner] 19:42:56

[Captioner] 19:42:58
WHATEVER THEY WILL WANT FROM OUR 

[Captioner] 19:42:59
COMMUNITY POINT OF VIEW, WE NEED 

[Captioner] 19:43:01
THE SUPPORT FROM THE CITY.

[Captioner] 19:43:03
OTHERWISE, I DON'T KNOW.

[Captioner] 19:43:05
WE HAVE TO MOVE AWAY THIS 

[Captioner] 19:43:05
PLACE.

[Captioner] 19:43:08
WE CANNOT LIVE IF WE GO TO A 

[Captioner] 19:43:10
PLACE THAT HAVE SO MANY -- THIS 

[Captioner] 19:43:12
WEEK WE HAVE THREE OPEN HOUSES 

[Captioner] 19:43:13
IN OUR COMMUNITY.

[Captioner] 19:43:14
I DON'T THINK PEOPLE WANT TO 

[Captioner] 19:43:15
MOVE HERE.

[Captioner] 19:43:19
THE COMMUNITY IS GOING TO BE 

[Captioner] 19:43:21
NONLIVABLE IF THIS HAPPENS.

[Captioner] 19:43:26

DEALING WITH THIS HOMELESS 

[Captioner] 19:43:45
CRISIS FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS, 

[Captioner] 19:43:46
UNFORTUNATELY BEGAN IN 2020 

[Captioner] 19:43:47
BECAUSE YOU ALL KNOW WHAT 

[Captioner] 19:43:48
HAPPENED.

[Captioner] 19:43:50
THE PROBLEM IS THAT WE SEE 

[Captioner] 19:43:51
HOMELESS PEOPLE WALKING ON OUR 

[Captioner] 19:43:54
STREETS, RECENTLY JUST LAST 

[Captioner] 19:43:55
WEEK, THERE WAS PERSON WALKING 

[Captioner] 19:43:56
WITH A HAMMER.

[Captioner] 19:43:58
THEY ARE FRIGHTENING OUR KIDS.

[Captioner] 19:44:00
THEY HAVE TRIED TO SCARE THE 

[Captioner] 19:44:03
KIDS WHEN WE WERE IN THE SWMG 

[Captioner] 19:44:05
 

[Captioner] 19:44:06
SWIMMING POOL.

[Captioner] 19:44:08
WE APPRECIATE YOU HELPING US, WE 

[Captioner] 19:44:11
HAVE CALLED THE COPS, NOTHING 

[Captioner] 19:44:12
HELPS.

[Captioner] 19:44:15
WE HAVE INSTALLED CAMERAS.

[Captioner] 19:44:17
IF EVEN IF WE REPORT IT TO THE 

[Captioner] 19:44:18
COPS THEY CANNOT DO ANYTHING 

[Captioner] 19:44:20
ABOUT IT.

[Captioner] 19:44:21
ACROSS THE BOULEVARD YOU CAN SEE 

[Captioner] 19:44:24
THERE'S A HUGE ENCAMPMENT OF THE 

[Captioner] 19:44:25
POPULATION WHICH IS GREATER DAY 

[Captioner] 19:44:26
BY DAY.

[Captioner] 19:44:27
WE ARE WORRIED ABOUT THE SAFETY 

[Captioner] 19:44:28
OF OUR KIDS.

[Captioner] 19:44:30
WE CANNOT USE OUR KIDS IN THE 

[Captioner] 19:44:33
BACKYARD ALONE WHICH IS A BASIC 

[Captioner] 19:44:34
RIGHT FOR ALL OF THE KIDS.

[Captioner] 19:44:36
IF YOU COULD HELP US WITH THIS, 

[Captioner] 19:44:38
THAT WOULD BE READY GREAT.

[Captioner] 19:44:39

REGARDING THE QUESTION ABOUT THE

[Captioner] 19:47:49
THAT HAS TO BE EXAMINED 

[Captioner] 19:47:51
REGARDING THE EFFECTIVENESS.

[Captioner] 19:47:54
I KNOW WE HAVE HAD SOME STREETS 

[Captioner] 19:47:56
IN THE PAST NOT FENCED OFF BUT 

[Captioner] 19:47:58
BECAUSE OF TRAFFIC AND OTHER 

[Captioner] 19:48:00

[Captioner] 19:48:27

[Captioner] 19:48:35

REASON, LOOK LIKE ACTUALLY IT'S 

[Captioner] 19:56:56
THE LUNAR NEW YEAR EVENT WILL BE 

[Captioner] 19:56:56

[Captioner] 19:56:59
I'M HOPING THIS LAST YEAR WILL 

[Captioner] 19:57:02
NOT BE KIND OF A ONE TIME 

[Captioner] 19:57:04
WONDER.

[Captioner] 19:57:07
I'M HOPING THIS SPECIAL LUNAR 

[Captioner] 19:57:09
NEW YEAR EVENT HAS BECOME A 

[Captioner] 19:57:10
SIGNATURE EVENT FOR OUR CITY.

[Captioner] 19:57:12

[Captioner] 19:57:28
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

[Captioner] 19:57:29
>> NEXT SPEAKER.

[Captioner] 19:57:31
>> THIS CITY COUNCIL HAS NOT 

[Captioner] 19:57:33
BEEN PAYING VERY MUCH ATTENTION 

[Captioner] 19:57:35
TO THE BUDGET SO I THOUGHT I'D 

[Captioner] 19:57:36
GO OVER SOME OF THE MISSING 

[Captioner] 19:57:37
INFORMATION.

[Captioner] 19:57:41
FOR EXAMPLE, AT THE LAST ANNUAL 

[Captioner] 19:57:41
COMPREHENSIVE FINANCIAL REPORT 

[Captioner] 19:57:43
IN THE NOTES TO FINANCIAL 

[Captioner] 19:57:44
STATEMENTS, THE CITY COUNCIL WAS 

[Captioner] 19:57:47
TOLD THAT THE STATE HAS BEEN 

[Captioner] 19:57:48
UNABLE TO PROVIDE ANY ESTIMATE 

[Captioner] 19:57:51
OF THE OVERPAYMENTS.

[Captioner] 19:57:54
THAT'S AN EXACT QUOTE OF THE -- 

[Captioner] 19:57:55
YOU KNOW, OF THOSE ADDITIONAL 

[Captioner] 19:57:58
AMOUNTS BESIZE THE FIRST $4 

[Captioner] 19:57:59
MILLION OVERPAYMENT.

[Captioner] 19:58:01
THE REMAINDER IS MAYBE ANOTHER 

[Captioner] 19:58:03
$24 MILLION BUT THAT'S JUST AN 

[Captioner] 19:58:04
ESTIMATE BECAUSE THE STATE LAST 

[Captioner] 19:58:06
NOT PROVIDED THAT NUMBER AND 

[Captioner] 19:58:07
THOSE NUMBERS HAVE BEEN COOKED 

[Captioner] 19:58:11
UP BY THE CITY ACCOUNTANTS.

[Captioner] 19:58:13
AND THEN WHAT ABOUT THE FUTURE?

[Captioner] 19:58:14
THAT'S JUST THE PAST 

[Captioner] 19:58:15
OVERPAYMENTS.

[Captioner] 19:58:16
WHAT ABOUT THE FUTURE?

[Captioner] 19:58:18
HOW DOES THIS AFFECT THE 

[Captioner] 19:58:18
BUDGET?

[Captioner] 19:58:20
WELL U.C. WE'RE NOT GOING TO 

[Captioner] 19:58:21
TALK ABOUT THE CONTINGENCY 

[Captioner] 19:58:22
RESERVE.

[Captioner] 19:58:23
WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT FUTURE 

[Captioner] 19:58:25
ESTIMATES OF EVERY YEAR, THE 

[Captioner] 19:58:27
CITY WAS ESTIMATING SOMEWHERE IN 

[Captioner] 19:58:29
THE RANGE OF AROUND $105 MILLION 

[Captioner] 19:58:32
OF SALES TAX REVENUES, ANNUALLY, 

[Captioner] 19:58:34
EACH YEAR FOR THE NEXT TWO, 

[Captioner] 19:58:36
THREE YEARS.BUT IN THE LAST YEAR 

[Captioner] 19:58:38
THAT DROPPED TO $83 MILLION 

[Captioner] 19:58:39
SUDDENLY.

[Captioner] 19:58:42
AND IT LOOKS LIKE JUST, YOU 

[Captioner] 19:58:44
KNOW, LOOKING AT THE NUMBERS, 

[Captioner] 19:58:46
MAYBE THAT'S GOING TO DROP TO -- 

[Captioner] 19:58:48
THAT WAS ONLY WITH HALF A YEAR 

[Captioner] 19:58:52
OF CORRECTIONS, BAKED INTO THE 

[Captioner] 19:58:52
$83 MILLION.

[Captioner] 19:58:54
SO IT LOOKS LIKE THE NEXT COUPLE 

[Captioner] 19:58:56
OF YEARS WE'RE GOING TO DROP TO 

[Captioner] 19:59:00
THE RANGE OF 60 OR $70 MILLION,

[Captioner] 19:59:00
 

[Captioner] 19:59:03
AND 60 OR $70 MILLION IS A LOT 

[Captioner] 19:59:05
LESS THAN 105.

[Captioner] 19:59:07
DO YOU SEE WHAT I'M POINTING 

[Captioner] 19:59:07
AT?

[Captioner] 19:59:09
TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF 

[Captioner] 19:59:14
MISSING MONEY BASED ON OVER 

[Captioner] 19:59:18
OPTIMISTIC REVENUE FORECASTS.

[Captioner] 19:59:20
AND NOBODY ON THE CITY COUNCIL, 

[Captioner] 19:59:21
THERE IS NO BUDGET COMMITTEE 

[Captioner] 19:59:23
HERE, NOBODY CARES.

[Captioner] 19:59:24
THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 19:59:27

THIS ROOM, I'D LIKE THE FREMONT 

[Captioner] 20:00:15
COUNCIL TO CALL FOR A PERMANENT 

[Captioner] 20:00:16
CEASE FIRE IN GAZA.

[Captioner] 20:00:19
EARLIER IN JANUARY THERE WAS A 

[Captioner] 20:00:21
NATIONAL WEEK OF PRAYER FOR 

[Captioner] 20:00:24
CHRISTIAN UNITY, INCLUDING 

[Captioner] 20:00:26
REPRESENTATIVES OF DIFFERENT 

[Captioner] 20:00:29
FILIPINO CHURCHES TO LEARN MORE 

[Captioner] 20:00:31
HOW TO ADVOCATE FOR A CEASE 

[Captioner] 20:00:31

[Captioner] 20:00:34
AMONG THOSE CHURCHES WAS MYSELF 

[Captioner] 20:00:38
AND PASTOR YOHAN WHO ALSO SERVES 

[Captioner] 20:00:42
A LOT OF FREMONT METHODISTS

[Captioner] 20:00:43

[Captioner] 20:00:45
WELL.PEOPLE ARE TAKING ACTION 

[Captioner] 20:00:48

[Captioner] 20:00:50
THE STRUGGLE FOR GAZA IS A 

[Captioner] 20:00:52
STRUGGLE THE U.S. CITIZENS CAN 

[Captioner] 20:00:53
AND SHOULD TAKE UP AND TREATMENT 

[Captioner] 20:00:55

[Captioner] 20:00:56
CITIES IN THE UNITED STATES TO 

[Captioner] 20:00:59
PASS A CEASE FIRE RESOLUTION BY 

[Captioner] 20:01:00
HEEDING THE VOICES OF THE 

[Captioner] 20:01:02
COMMUNITY AND NOT WAITING.

[Captioner] 20:01:04
THIS IS THE THIRD ATTEMPT AT A 

[Captioner] 20:01:05
CITY COUNCIL MEETING, I THINK 

[Captioner] 20:01:08
THE FIRST TWO WERE ACTUALLY 

[Captioner] 20:01:09
CANCELLED AND POSTPONED SO WE 

[Captioner] 20:01:11

[Captioner] 20:01:13

[Captioner] 20:01:17

I'LL

[Captioner] 20:01:26
 CEDE THE REST OF MY TIME.

[Captioner] 20:01:27
>> NEXT SPEAKER.

[Captioner] 20:01:28
>> HELLO, GOOD EVENING.

[Captioner] 20:01:32
MY NAME IS GULED ROBNE

[Captioner] 20:01:33
Y.

[Captioner] 20:01:35
I'M A FATHER OF FIVE CHILDREN 

[Captioner] 20:01:41
BEING IN THE CITY OF FREMONT.

[Captioner] 20:01:42
I WANT TO ASK THE COUNCIL TO 

[Captioner] 20:01:47
CALL A CEASE FIRE FOR PLN FOR

[Captioner] 20:01:47
 

[Captioner] 20:01:52
GAZA, LEGALLILY OCCUPIED GAZA,

[Captioner] 20:01:53
 

[Captioner] 20:01:57
1948 ISRAEL HAS AN APARTHEID 

[Captioner] 20:01:59
SYSTEM GRADUALLY.

[Captioner] 20:02:01
OCCUPYING MORE AND MORE OF LAND, 

[Captioner] 20:02:04
THE U.S. HAS GIVEN AID TO ISRAEL 

[Captioner] 20:02:08
MORE THAN ANY OTHER, SEND WORLD 

[Captioner] 20:02:11
WAR II BY PROVIDING $317 BILLION 

[Captioner] 20:02:12
EVER SINCE THEN.

[Captioner] 20:02:14
AS I THINK FREMONT BEING A VERY 

[Captioner] 20:02:16
DIVERSE HAVING SO MANY DIFFERENT 

[Captioner] 20:02:19
FOLKS COMING FROM GLOBALLY, THE 

[Captioner] 20:02:23
FACT THAT WE WITNESS AS THE

[Captioner] 20:02:23
 

[Captioner] 20:02:26
BLACKMAN'S HISTORY THE FACT THAT 

[Captioner] 20:02:28
WE HAVE KIDS WHO HAVE BEEN 

[Captioner] 20:02:30
DREAMING, IN TERMS OF 

[Captioner] 20:02:31
TECHNOLOGY, I THINK AT MINIMUM 

[Captioner] 20:02:33
WE SHOULD AT LEAST HAVE THE 

[Captioner] 20:02:34
CONSIDERATION AND THE BRAVENESS 

[Captioner] 20:02:36
TO CALL A CEASE FIRE FOR GAZA.

[Captioner] 20:02:40
THEY ARE MORE THAN 10,000 

[Captioner] 20:02:40
CHILDREN DIED.

[Captioner] 20:02:42
AND REMEMBER THAT THERE IS NO 

[Captioner] 20:02:44
WATER, THERE IS NO ENERGY, THERE 

[Captioner] 20:02:46
IS NO INTERNET.

[Captioner] 20:02:50
NOT EVEN IN SOUTH AFRICA YOU 

[Captioner] 20:02:51
USED TO EXPERIENCE THAT.

[Captioner] 20:02:53
I THINK YOU WANT TO BE ON THE 

[Captioner] 20:02:56
 

[Captioner] 20:02:57
RIGHT-HAND SIDE OF HISTORY.

[Captioner] 20:02:58
I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE A 

[Captioner] 20:03:00
MATTER OF TIME WHEN YOU'RE GOING 

[Captioner] 20:03:02
TO CHOOSE YOU'RE GOING TO BE ON 

[Captioner] 20:03:05
THE WRONG SIDE OF RIFT OR THE 

[Captioner] 20:03:06
RIGHT SIDE OF HISTORY.

[Captioner] 20:03:08
I ENCOURAGE YOU REALLY DEEP TO 

[Captioner] 20:03:10
FOLLOW EVEN THE CONGRESS HAS 

[Captioner] 20:03:11
CALLED FOR A PERMANENT CEASE 

[Captioner] 20:03:12

[Captioner] 20:03:17
COUNTY, SCHOOL BOARD HAS CALLED 

[Captioner] 20:03:18

[Captioner] 20:09:04
$50 FOR A LARGER CONFERENCE ROOM 

[Captioner] 20:09:07
AND $45, 40 FOR OUR SMALL OR 

[Captioner] 20:09:11
MEDIUM SIZE CONFERENCE ROOMS.

[Captioner] 20:09:13
GROUP 7 IS FREMONT RESIDENTS AND 

[Captioner] 20:09:16
NONPROFIT, AND NONRESIDENT 

[Captioner] 20:09:17
NONPROFITS AND THOSE ARE CHARGED 

[Captioner] 20:09:20
AT RATES DURING BUSINESS HOURS 

[Captioner] 20:09:24
AND AFTER HOURS AS WELL, AND 

[Captioner] 20:09:27
THEN YOU'LL SEE FOR GROUP 5 

[Captioner] 20:09:29
NONRESIDENTS AND BUSINESS USE 

[Captioner] 20:09:32
FOR HIGHER RATES FOR RENTALS AND 

[Captioner] 20:09:33
THAT APPLIES DURING BUSINESS 

[Captioner] 20:09:35
HOURS AND EVENING HOURS.

[Captioner] 20:09:36
>> Councilmember Salwan:   SO 

[Captioner] 20:09:38
ARE YOU SEEING INCREASED DEMAND 

[Captioner] 20:09:39
FOR THESE KIND OF FACILITIES?

[Captioner] 20:09:41
>> SO WE ARE ANTICIPATING 

[Captioner] 20:09:42
INCREASED DEMAND.

[Captioner] 20:09:43
DURING COVID WE DIDN'T REALLY 

[Captioner] 20:09:47
HAVE THAT MANY EVENING RENTALS.

[Captioner] 20:09:49
SO WE TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY TO 

[Captioner] 20:09:51
UPGRADE OUR CONFERENCE ROOMS.

[Captioner] 20:09:55
AND RIGHT NOW WE ARE GOING TO 

[Captioner] 20:09:58
GET A NEW MARKETING STRATEGY TO 

[Captioner] 20:10:01
MARKET OUR CONFERENCE ROOMS ALSO 

[Captioner] 20:10:02
HOPING AND ANTICIPATING THAT 

[Captioner] 20:10:04
THERE'S GOING TO BE INCREASED 

[Captioner] 20:10:08
DEMAND NOW THAT WE'RE OUT OF 

[Captioner] 20:10:09
COVID, THE PANDEMIC.

[Captioner] 20:10:12
>> Councilmember Salwan:   VERY 

[Captioner] 20:10:12
NICE.

[Captioner] 20:10:13
THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 20:10:14
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 20:10:17
NEXT IS COUNCILMEMBER COX.

[Captioner] 20:10:19
>> Vice Mayor Cox:   THANK YOU 

[Captioner] 20:10:19
VERY MUCH.

[Captioner] 20:10:20
I APPRECIATE THE REPORT.

[Captioner] 20:10:22
I JUST HAD A COUPLE OF 

[Captioner] 20:10:22
QUESTIONS.

[Captioner] 20:10:25
AND ONE IS, WHEN I LOOK AT SOME 

[Captioner] 20:10:28
OF THE OTHER RENTALS, AT OTHER 

[Captioner] 20:10:30
LOCATIONS IN THE CITY, IS THERE 

[Captioner] 20:10:34
A MINIMUM REQUIREMENT, NUMBER OF 

[Captioner] 20:10:36
HOURS, NUMBER OF HOURS TO RENT 

[Captioner] 20:10:40
THE ROOMS?

[Captioner] 20:10:43
>> RIGHT -- TYPICALLY WHEN WE DO 

[Captioner] 20:10:46
GET ROOM RENTAL REQUESTS THEY'RE 

[Captioner] 20:10:47
ABOUT AN HOUR.

[Captioner] 20:10:49
SO I'LL HAVE TO CHECK WITH OUR 

[Captioner] 20:10:50
FACILITY COORDINATORS BUT RIGHT 

[Captioner] 20:10:52
NOW WE DON'T HAVE A MINIMUM 

[Captioner] 20:10:55
NUMBER OF HOURS TO RENT THE 

[Captioner] 20:10:56
ROOMS.

[Captioner] 20:10:57
>> Vice Mayor Cox:   OKAY SO 

[Captioner] 20:10:58
IT'S STRAIGHT, WHATEVER TIME YOU 

[Captioner] 20:11:00
NEED YOU PAY STRAIGHT, OKAY, 

[Captioner] 20:11:01
THAT'S GOOD TO KNOW.

[Captioner] 20:11:03
AND WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT UPGRADE 

[Captioner] 20:11:04
I'M HEARING YOU, THAT'S GREAT 

[Captioner] 20:11:06
ABOUT THE ZOOM AND THE SOFTWARE 

[Captioner] 20:11:10
THAT GOES TO RUN THE VIRTUAL 

[Captioner] 20:11:13
MEETINGS BUT WHAT I DIDN'T HEAR 

[Captioner] 20:11:15
WAS THERE NEW FURNITURE, 

[Captioner] 20:11:16
CARPETING OR ANYTHING, WHEN YOU 

[Captioner] 20:11:19
SAY YOU UPGRADE, I JUST WANT TO 

[Captioner] 20:11:20
UNDERSTAND, WHAT DOES THAT SCOPE 

[Captioner] 20:11:22
OF WORK MEAN?

[Captioner] 20:11:24
>> SO DURING COVID WE DID TAKE 

[Captioner] 20:11:25
THE OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AT THE 

[Captioner] 20:11:27
TECHNOLOGY TO UPGRADE.

[Captioner] 20:11:30
BUT WE ARE LOOKING AT THINGS 

[Captioner] 20:11:35
LIKE CLEANING OUR UPHOLSTERY

[Captioner] 20:11:35
 TO 

[Captioner] 20:11:40
MAKE IT MORE WARM AND INVITE

[Captioner] 20:11:41
ING 

[Captioner] 20:11:44
AND TO OUR PEOPLE WHO ARE 

[Captioner] 20:11:45
RENTING OUR FACILITIES.

[Captioner] 20:11:48
SO WE REALLY ARE FOCUSING ON THE 

[Captioner] 20:11:50
TECHNOLOGY PIECE OF THINGS JUST 

[Captioner] 20:11:55
TO FORECAST WHAT THAT SERVICE 

[Captioner] 20:11:57
NEEDED WILL BE.

[Captioner] 20:11:58
>> Vice Mayor Cox:   OKAY AND 

[Captioner] 20:12:01
THEN COME ALONG WHO OPERATES IT 

[Captioner] 20:12:03
NEED IT, I KNOW WE HAVE OUR 

[Captioner] 20:12:05
BUDGET AND THINGS TO STICK TO.

[Captioner] 20:12:07
WELL I ALSO WANTED TO FIND OUT 

[Captioner] 20:12:08
IS HAD ANY TYPE OF ADVANCE 

[Captioner] 20:12:11
NOTICE THAT YOU HAVE TO RENT 

[Captioner] 20:12:14
THESE ROOMS OUT?

[Captioner] 20:12:16
FOR JUST SO THE PUBLIC KNOWS IF 

[Captioner] 20:12:18
THEY WANT TO USE THESE 

[Captioner] 20:12:20
FACILITIES, HOW MANY DAYS OR 

[Captioner] 20:12:21
HOURS OR, YOU KNOW, WHAT IS THE 

[Captioner] 20:12:23
ADVANCE NOTICE TO BE ABLE TO 

[Captioner] 20:12:25
RESERVE THE ROOMS?

[Captioner] 20:12:27
>> RIGHT, SO TYPICALLY RIGHT 

[Captioner] 20:12:29
NOW, ESPECIALLY DURING EVENING 

[Captioner] 20:12:31
HOURS WHERE WE DO CHARGE OUR 

[Captioner] 20:12:33
DIFFERENT CATEGORIES, THERE 

[Captioner] 20:12:36
ISN'T LIKE AN ADVANCE NOTICE 

[Captioner] 20:12:37
THAT'S GIVEN.

[Captioner] 20:12:38
WE JUST MAINLY LOOK AT 

[Captioner] 20:12:39
AVAILABILITY, WE HAVE 

[Captioner] 20:12:42
AVAILABILITY, WE'LL BOOK THE RENTER.

[Captioner] 20:12:44
BUT IF WE DON'T WE MIGHT SUGGEST 

[Captioner] 20:12:46
OTHER CONFERENCE ROOMS THAT 

[Captioner] 20:12:48
MIGHT FIT THEIR NEEDS.

[Captioner] 20:12:49
OR -- THERE HASN'T TYPICALLY 

[Captioner] 20:12:51
BEEN AN ISSUE IN TERMS OF ROOMS 

[Captioner] 20:12:53
NOT BEING AVAILABLE.

[Captioner] 20:12:55
WE'RE GENERALLY ABLE TO 

[Captioner] 20:12:56
ACCOMMODATE RENTERS.

[Captioner] 20:12:57
>> Vice Mayor Cox:   OKAY, 

[Captioner] 20:12:58
THAT'S GOOD TO KNOW.

[Captioner] 20:13:00
AND IF THERE'S A PROCESS SO THE 

[Captioner] 20:13:02
PUBLIC WILL KNOW AS WELL, HOW 

[Captioner] 20:13:04
DOES ONE GO ABOUT RESERVING THE 

[Captioner] 20:13:04
ROOM?

[Captioner] 20:13:06
WHAT'S THE PROCESS?

[Captioner] 20:13:07
>> RIGHT.

[Captioner] 20:13:11
SO TYPICALLY RIGHT NOW, IF LIKE

[Captioner] 20:13:11
 

[Captioner] 20:13:13
RENTERS WILL BE ABLE TO CALL THE 

[Captioner] 20:13:16
FRC LINE AND SPIKE TO OUR 

[Captioner] 20:13:18
FACILITIES COORDINATOR AND SHE 

[Captioner] 20:13:21
CHECKS ROOM AVAILABILITY AND 

[Captioner] 20:13:23
THEY WILL BE ABLE TO RENT A ROOM 

[Captioner] 20:13:24
THROUGH HER.

[Captioner] 20:13:27
BUT THERE IS A FORM TO FILL OUT 

[Captioner] 20:13:29
AND THAT'S THE PROCESSING RIGHT 

[Captioner] 20:13:29
NOW.

[Captioner] 20:13:30
>> Vice Mayor Cox:   THEY DON'T 

[Captioner] 20:13:34
NEED TO ACQUIRE ANY INSURANCE 

[Captioner] 20:13:35
RIGHT NOW?

[Captioner] 20:13:36
>> NOT TO MY KNOWLEDGE.

[Captioner] 20:13:37
>> Vice Mayor Cox:   THAT'S 

[Captioner] 20:13:38
ANOTHER FACTOR DEPENDING ON 

[Captioner] 20:13:40
WHICH FACILITY DOES REQUIRE THE 

[Captioner] 20:13:42
INSURANCE.

[Captioner] 20:13:44
I JUST WANTED TO BE CLEAR, THANK 

[Captioner] 20:13:46
YOU FOR UNDERSTANDING ALL MY 

[Captioner] 20:13:46
QUESTIONS.

[Captioner] 20:13:47
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU NEXT 

[Captioner] 20:13:50
FOR CLARIFYING QUESTIONS.

[Captioner] 20:13:54
IS COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL.

[Captioner] 20:14:04
>> Councilmember Campbell:   

[Captioner] 20:14:06
ACTUALLY, MY QUESTION WAS 

[Captioner] 20:14:06
ANSWERED.

[Captioner] 20:14:07
THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 20:14:09
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 20:14:11
I'LL ASK A COUPLE OF QUICK 

[Captioner] 20:14:12
CLARIFYING QUESTIONS.

[Captioner] 20:14:13
I KNOW WE HAVE BEEN TRYING TO 

[Captioner] 20:14:15
MAINTAIN THE FACILITY.

[Captioner] 20:14:16
AND THERE WAS SOME CHALLENGES 

[Captioner] 20:14:19
THAT WE'VE HAD RECENTLY WITH THE 

[Captioner] 20:14:21
ROOFING AS WELL AS WITH SOME OF 

[Captioner] 20:14:22
THE FUMIGATION WE HAD OVER THE 

[Captioner] 20:14:23
HOLIDAYS.

[Captioner] 20:14:25
IS THE FEE SCHEDULE ADOPTIONS 

[Captioner] 20:14:26
THAT WE'RE MAKING GOING TO BE 

[Captioner] 20:14:28
SUFFICIENT FOR US TO BE ABLE TO, 

[Captioner] 20:14:30
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT US TO HAVE 

[Captioner] 20:14:32
TO COME BACK OVER AND OVER AGAIN 

[Captioner] 20:14:34
BUT SEEING THAT SOME OF THE 

[Captioner] 20:14:36
FACILITIES ARE MORE AGED, IS 

[Captioner] 20:14:37
THIS GOING TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS 

[Captioner] 20:14:40
OUR SCHEDULE WITH THESE 

[Captioner] 20:14:40
CHANGES?

[Captioner] 20:14:42
AND THEN ALSO I WOULD SECOND, I 

[Captioner] 20:14:44
KNOW OUR COUNCILMEMBERS COMMENT, 

[Captioner] 20:14:46
JUST MAKING SURE THAT WE WANT TO 

[Captioner] 20:14:47
MAKE SURE THE PUBLIC UNDERSTANDS 

[Captioner] 20:14:50
HOW TO BEST ACCESS OUR 

[Captioner] 20:14:50
FACILITY.

[Captioner] 20:14:52
BECAUSE I THINK THE FREMONT 

[Captioner] 20:14:53
FAMILY RESOURCE CENTER, HAVING 

[Captioner] 20:14:56
BEEN THERE FOR THIS LONG A 

[Captioner] 20:14:58
PERIOD OF TIME AND UNDER YOUR 

[Captioner] 20:15:00
STEWARDSHIP KEY ACCESS POINT 

[Captioner] 20:15:02
FROM MANY OF OUR COMMUNITY BASED 

[Captioner] 20:15:04
ORGANIZATIONS IS A WONDERFUL 

[Captioner] 20:15:05
TOOL TO HAVE.

[Captioner] 20:15:08
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE WE COULD 

[Captioner] 20:15:10
HAVE AS FAR AS LANGUAGE ACCESS 

[Captioner] 20:15:12
OR COMMUNITY MEMBERS HOW TO BEST 

[Captioner] 20:15:13
ACCESS THAT.

[Captioner] 20:15:16
ESPECIALLY COMING OUT OF COVID, 

[Captioner] 20:15:18
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOT 

[Captioner] 20:15:19
ACCESS TO THAT.

[Captioner] 20:15:21
IS THERE SOMETHING WE CAN DO?

[Captioner] 20:15:24
>> THE FRC, THIS INCREASE IN FEE 

[Captioner] 20:15:27
SCHEDULE WILL BE ONE OF THE FEE 

[Captioner] 20:15:31
SCHEDULES THAT WERE MENTIONED, 

[Captioner] 20:15:32
BASICALLY THE NEW ROOF 

[Captioner] 20:15:34
REPLACEMENT, SECURITY CAMERAS, 

[Captioner] 20:15:36
WE'VE ALSO -- SO THOSE UPGRADES 

[Captioner] 20:15:40
HAVE BEEN PAID FOR BY CDBG 

[Captioner] 20:15:40
FUNDS.

[Captioner] 20:15:42
WE APPLIED TO CAPITAL 

[Captioner] 20:15:43
IMPROVEMENTS THROUGH CDBG.

[Captioner] 20:15:45
SO IT'S REALLY A COMBINATION OF 

[Captioner] 20:15:47
MANY SOURCE HE OF FUNDING THAT 

[Captioner] 20:15:50
WE'RE ABLE TO IMPROVE THE 

[Captioner] 20:15:53
AMENITIES AND BASIC IMPROVEMENTS 

[Captioner] 20:15:55
AT THE FRC AS WELL SUCH AS THE 

[Captioner] 20:15:55
ROOF.

[Captioner] 20:15:59
SO IT'S REALLY ADDING, THIS 

[Captioner] 20:16:01
INCREASE IS REALLY ADDING TO 

[Captioner] 20:16:02
THAT POT OF DIFFERENT REVENUE 

[Captioner] 20:16:06
SOURCES THAT WE RECEIVE.

[Captioner] 20:16:07
>> Mayor Mei:   OKAY, THANK 

[Captioner] 20:16:07
YOU.

[Captioner] 20:16:08
BECAUSE I JUST WANTED TO MAKE 

[Captioner] 20:16:09
SURE.

[Captioner] 20:16:10
THAT'S SUFFICIENT.

[Captioner] 20:16:12
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN, YOU ASK 

[Captioner] 20:16:14
ANOTHER FOLLOW UP QUESTION.

[Captioner] 20:16:15
>> Councilmember Salwan:   NO, I 

[Captioner] 20:16:17
JUST I AGREE WE NEED MORE 

[Captioner] 20:16:18
MARKETING.

[Captioner] 20:16:21
I THINK PEOPLE NEED EVENT PLACES 

[Captioner] 20:16:23
AND MEETING PLACES, THAT WOULD 

[Captioner] 20:16:24
BE GREAT.

[Captioner] 20:16:26
I WANT TO MAKE A MOTION TO MOVE

[Captioner] 20:20:55
>> GOOD EVENING, CITY COUNCIL MY 

[Captioner] 20:20:59
NAME IS ROBERTA RYAN, I GREW UP 

[Captioner] 20:21:01
HERE IN FREMONT AND I CARE WHAT 

[Captioner] 20:21:03
HAPPENS HERE IN MY HOME TOWN.

[Captioner] 20:21:05
I CALL ON THE CITY OF FREMONT TO 

[Captioner] 20:21:08
CONSIDER THE HUMANITARIAN ISSUE 

[Captioner] 20:21:10
OF THE GENOCIDE THAT IS 

[Captioner] 20:21:12
HAPPENING IN PLN THAT IS BEING 

[Captioner] 20:21:14
ARMED AND FUNDED BY OUR 

[Captioner] 20:21:14
GOVERNMENT.

[Captioner] 20:21:16
THE DEATH TOLL IS NEARING 30,000 

[Captioner] 20:21:18
AND IT IS ESTIMATED THAT EVEN 

[Captioner] 20:21:20
MORE WILL DIE FROM STARVATION 

[Captioner] 20:21:23
AND DISEASE AS MUCH AS FROM THE 

[Captioner] 20:21:25
BOMBINGS AND IT WILL TAKE 70 

[Captioner] 20:21:27
YEARS TO REBUILD GAZA, TO 

[Captioner] 20:21:29
REBUILD THE HOSPITALS SCHOOLS 

[Captioner] 20:21:30
AND HOMES THAT HAVE BEEN 

[Captioner] 20:21:31
DESTROYED.

[Captioner] 20:21:32
I'M HERE TO SAY THAT THE ISSUE 

[Captioner] 20:21:35
OF A CEASE FIRE RESOLUTION AND 

[Captioner] 20:21:37
TAKING A STAND ON THIS ISSUE IS 

[Captioner] 20:21:38
A LOCAL ISSUE.

[Captioner] 20:21:40
BECAUSE OUR TAXPAYER DOLLARS 

[Captioner] 20:21:41
THAT WE CONTRIBUTE WHETHER 

[Captioner] 20:21:43
THAT'S HERE LOCALLY WE 

[Captioner] 20:21:45
CONTRIBUTE FEDERAL TAXPAYER 

[Captioner] 20:21:47
DOLLARS AND THE LINK IS NOW 

[Captioner] 20:21:48
UNDENIABLE BETWEEN OUR LOCAL 

[Captioner] 20:21:50
ECONOMY AND OUR TAXPAYER DOLLARS 

[Captioner] 20:21:52
AND THE BOMBS THAT ARE BEING 

[Captioner] 20:21:55
FUNDED AND DROPPED IN PLN AND 

[Captioner] 20:21:57
OUR HOME COUNTRIES IN THE NAME 

[Captioner] 20:22:01
OF PROFIT LAND GRABBING AND 

[Captioner] 20:22:01
ETHNIC CLEANSING.

[Captioner] 20:22:03
IT IS A LOCAL ISSUE BECAUSE OUR 

[Captioner] 20:22:04
CITY HAS INVESTMENTS AS I'VE 

[Captioner] 20:22:08
LEARNED AS THE CITY OF HAYWARD 

[Captioner] 20:22:11
VOTED TO INVEST $1.6 MILLION 

[Captioner] 20:22:13
AWAY FROM COMPANIES THAT 

[Captioner] 20:22:14
DIRECTLY BENEFIT FROM THE 

[Captioner] 20:22:15
OCCUPATION IN PLN.

[Captioner] 20:22:17
IT IS A LOCAL ISSUE BECAUSE 

[Captioner] 20:22:20
FREMONT HOUSES IMMIGRATE AND 

[Captioner] 20:22:23
REFUGEE COMMUNITIES, AS WE HAVE 

[Captioner] 20:22:24
SEEN WITH THE STABBING AND 

[Captioner] 20:22:27
SHOOTING OF PLNIAN YOUTH IN 

[Captioner] 20:22:30
TEXAS, VERMONT AND A LONG CHILD 

[Captioner] 20:22:30
IN CHICAGO.

[Captioner] 20:22:32
SO WE CALL ON FREMONT TO TAKE A 

[Captioner] 20:22:35
STAND FOR A CEASE FIRE 

[Captioner] 20:22:37
RESOLUTION AS THE CITY OF 

[Captioner] 20:22:40
RICHMOND, SAN FRANCISCO AND 

[Captioner] 20:22:42
OAKLAND HAS AND FOR FREMONT 

[Captioner] 20:22:43
CONSIDER OTHER WAYS OF 

[Captioner] 20:22:46
SUPPORTING PLN TO DIVEST FROM 

[Captioner] 20:22:47
COMPANIES THAT ARE AIDING AN 

[Captioner] 20:22:50
ABEDDING THE OCCUPATION OF 

[Captioner] 20:22:52
GENOCIDE AND THAT IS MURDERING 

[Captioner] 20:22:55
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CHILDREN.

[Captioner] 20:22:55
[APPLAUSE]

[Captioner] 20:23:00
>> OUR NEXT SPEAKER IS RONY BA

[Captioner] 20:23:04
BATNIGAR FOLLOWED BY NUHAR 

[Captioner] 20:23:04
KHAN.

[Captioner] 20:23:08
>> HELLO, I'M A RESIDENT OF 

[Captioner] 20:23:10
TREATMENT IN DISTRICT 1 AND I'M 

[Captioner] 20:23:12
A COMMUNITY LEADER, ORGANIZER 

[Captioner] 20:23:15
AND TEACHER IN THE FIELD OF 

[Captioner] 20:23:16
SEXUAL VIOLENCE AND DOMESTIC 

[Captioner] 20:23:17
VIOLENCE AS WELL.

[Captioner] 20:23:20
I'M HERE URGING YOU TO WRITE A 

[Captioner] 20:23:22
RESOLUTION CALLING FOR AN 

[Captioner] 20:23:23
ENDURING CEASE FIRE IN GARS.

[Captioner] 20:23:25
WHEN WE TEACH OUR CHILDREN TO 

[Captioner] 20:23:27
INTERRUPT DATING AND DOMESTIC 

[Captioner] 20:23:29
VIOLENCE WE TEACH IF WE DO 

[Captioner] 20:23:31
NOTHING THE VIOLENCE SIMPLY 

[Captioner] 20:23:32
CONTINUES WITH NO END.

[Captioner] 20:23:34
HOWEVER IF WE SPEAK UP AND ACT 

[Captioner] 20:23:36
IT IS HARDER FOR THAT VIOLENCE 

[Captioner] 20:23:38
TO CONTINUE AS USUAL BECAUSE IT 

[Captioner] 20:23:40
BECOMES MORE VISIBLE, IT SETS A 

[Captioner] 20:23:42
NEW AND NECESSARY PRECEDENT THAT 

[Captioner] 20:23:43
IT IS UNACCEPTABLE.

[Captioner] 20:23:46
AS AN EDUCATOR I'VE ALSO HAD TO 

[Captioner] 20:23:48
TEACH ANY STUDENTS WHAT IT MEANS 

[Captioner] 20:23:49
TO TAKE ACCOUNTABILITY FOR HARM 

[Captioner] 20:23:54
AND THE MANY TACTICS LIKE

[Captioner] 20:23:54
 

[Captioner] 20:23:57
GASLIGHTING, TAKING 

[Captioner] 20:23:59
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR 

[Captioner] 20:23:59
ACTIONS.

[Captioner] 20:24:02
WE'VE ALREADY HEARD OTHER CITY 

[Captioner] 20:24:06
COUNCIL IN OTHER CITIES, A FORM 

[Captioner] 20:24:08
OF DEFLECTION TO BE HONEST 

[Captioner] 20:24:09
BECAUSE OTHER CITIES HAVE 

[Captioner] 20:24:11
ALREADY WEIGHED IN AND MADE REAL 

[Captioner] 20:24:12
DECISIONS LIKE NEIGHBORING 

[Captioner] 20:24:14
CITIES OF SF FREMONT RICHMOND 

[Captioner] 20:24:17
THAT HAVE ALSO PASSED THESE 

[Captioner] 20:24:19
RESOLUTIONS AND HAYWARD THAT 

[Captioner] 20:24:21
HAVE ALREADY FASTED A RESOLUTION 

[Captioner] 20:24:23
TO DIVEST.

[Captioner] 20:24:26
THE COUNTY STATE AND FEDERAL 

[Captioner] 20:24:28
LEVEL SO IT REALLY IS UP TO 

[Captioner] 20:24:29
COUNCILMEMBERS WHETHER THEY HAVE 

[Captioner] 20:24:32
THE HUMANITY AND AGENCY TO DO 

[Captioner] 20:24:33
SOMETHING OR TO CONTINUE TO 

[Captioner] 20:24:35
DEFLECT THAT RESPONSIBILITY.

[Captioner] 20:24:36
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE NOT TO 

[Captioner] 20:24:39
WEIGH IN ON AN INTERNATIONAL 

[Captioner] 20:24:41
ISSUE WHEN FREMONT IS A MAJORITY 

[Captioner] 20:24:42
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY.

[Captioner] 20:24:46
THE DEBT TOLL IN PLN IS NOW OVER 

[Captioner] 20:24:49
27,000 PEOPLE, NEARING 30,000.

[Captioner] 20:24:52
I URGE FREMONT CITY COUNCIL TO 

[Captioner] 20:24:54
FIND THE RADICAL COURAGE AMIDST 

[Captioner] 20:24:56
THE FEAR OF RETALIATION OF THE 

[Captioner] 20:24:57
LOSS OF POWER, OFFICE, CAREER 

[Captioner] 20:24:59
AND INSTEAD CHOOSE TO ACT.

[Captioner] 20:25:01
WE'LL CALL FOR A RESOLUTION 

[Captioner] 20:25:04
DEMANDING AN ENDURING CEASE FIRE 

[Captioner] 20:25:05
IN GAZA.

[Captioner] 20:25:06

[Captioner] 20:25:25
 PARENTS 

[Captioner] 20:25:28
WHO MOVED HERE IN 1968.

[Captioner] 20:25:30
A GOVERNMENT THAT CLAIMS TO BE 

[Captioner] 20:25:33
FOR THE PEOPLE AND BY THE 

[Captioner] 20:25:34
PEOPLE, SHOULD REPRESENT THE 

[Captioner] 20:25:35
PEOPLE.

[Captioner] 20:25:38
SINCE OCTOBER SEVENTH, THOUSANDS 

[Captioner] 20:25:40
OF PLNIANS HAVE BEEN KILLED IN 

[Captioner] 20:25:41
GAZA.

[Captioner] 20:25:42
THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION 

[Captioner] 20:25:44
AND THE UNITED NATIONS HAVE 

[Captioner] 20:25:46
DEEMED THE REGION AS A 

[Captioner] 20:25:47
CATASTROPHE.

[Captioner] 20:25:49
MORE THAN 1 MILLION HAVE BEEN 

[Captioner] 20:25:50
DISPLACED AND THE NUMBER IS ONLY 

[Captioner] 20:25:51
RISING.

[Captioner] 20:25:53
THIS IS A GENOCIDE AND I DON'T 

[Captioner] 20:25:54
ARE USE THAT WORD LIGHTLY.

[Captioner] 20:25:56
IT IS A GENOCIDE BECAUSE THREE 

[Captioner] 20:25:59
OUT OF FOUR PLNIAN CHILDREN HAVE 

[Captioner] 20:26:01
GONE INTO SURGERY WITHOUT 

[Captioner] 20:26:03
ANESTHESIA.

[Captioner] 20:26:05
ISRAEL KILLS TWO MOTHERS EVERY

[Captioner] 20:26:07
THE ONE MESSAGE I WANT TO GET 

[Captioner] 20:26:11

[Captioner] 20:26:13
THE QUESTION 

[Captioner] 20:26:15

[Captioner] 20:30:10
RESOLUTION TO CALL FOR AN 

[Captioner] 20:30:12
IMMEDIATE CEASE FIRE IN GAZA.

[Captioner] 20:30:16
ESPECIALLY THOUSANDS OF PAL 

[Captioner] 20:30:17
STEIN THAT HAVE BEEN LOCKED UP 

[Captioner] 20:30:20
IN THE TORTURE CAMP.

[Captioner] 20:30:22
THE ISRAELIS DON'T PAY ANY 

[Captioner] 20:30:23
ATTENTION TO THE RUINS OF WAR 

[Captioner] 20:30:26
AND THINK THEY CAN DO GENOCIDE 

[Captioner] 20:30:28
AND GET AWAY WITH IT BECAUSE THE 

[Captioner] 20:30:29
UNITED STATES WILL PROTECT 

[Captioner] 20:30:29
THEM.

[Captioner] 20:30:31
IT IS NOT ONLY A KILLING AND 

[Captioner] 20:30:33
TORTURE THAT IS WRONG IN ITSELF 

[Captioner] 20:30:36
I ALSO CONSTANTLY SEE IDEA OF 

[Captioner] 20:30:39
SOLDIERS TAKING JOY AND 

[Captioner] 20:30:41
INFLICTING PUNISHMENT ON 

[Captioner] 20:30:43

[Captioner] 20:30:45
THE AMERICANS WONDER WHAT 

[Captioner] 20:30:50
TAXPAYERS UTILIZE TO SOLVE 

[Captioner] 20:30:53
HOMELESSNESS, NOT USE OUR MONEY 

[Captioner] 20:30:56

I'M A POLITICAL ECONOMIST WITH A 

[Captioner] 20:31:15
SPECIALIZING IN THE MIDDLE 

[Captioner] 20:31:15
EAST.

[Captioner] 20:31:18
AND I'M A RESIDENT OF 

[Captioner] 20:31:18
TREATMENT.

[Captioner] 20:31:22
AND I SUPPORT THIS, THE CALL TO

[Captioner] 20:31:23
 

[Captioner] 20:31:25
AGENDIZE A CEASE FIRE 

[Captioner] 20:31:26
RESOLUTION.

[Captioner] 20:31:28
MANY OTHER CITIES HAVE DONE IT.

[Captioner] 20:31:30
THERE ARE MANY WAYS THAT THE 

[Captioner] 20:31:33
CITY OF FREMONT CAN AMPLIFY THE 

[Captioner] 20:31:35
VOICES OF ITS RESIDENTS WHICH I 

[Captioner] 20:31:37
REALLY, REALLY URGE YOU TO DO.

[Captioner] 20:31:38
HAYWARD DID A DIFFERENT THING.

[Captioner] 20:31:43
THE OTHER DAY THEY VOTED FOR

[Captioner] 20:31:44
 

[Captioner] 20:31:46
DIVESTMENT THERE FOUR COMPANIES 

[Captioner] 20:31:49
THAT ARE IN THE HAYWARD'S 

[Captioner] 20:31:49
PORTFOLIO.

[Captioner] 20:31:52
SO THERE ARE MANY WAYS TO SIGNAL 

[Captioner] 20:31:53
THIS AND ACTUALLY TO MAKE A 

[Captioner] 20:31:56
DIFFERENCE BECAUSE EVERY KIND OF 

[Captioner] 20:31:59
BOYCOTT OR REFUSAL TO SPEND 

[Captioner] 20:32:00
MONEY IN ISRAEL WHICH IS 

[Captioner] 20:32:03
COMMITTING GENOCIDE IS AN ACTION 

[Captioner] 20:32:05
THAT REALLY HURTS AND REALLY 

[Captioner] 20:32:07
COUNTS.

[Captioner] 20:32:11
NOW I HAVE HERE THE -- A

[Captioner] 20:32:12
 COPY OF 

[Captioner] 20:32:16
THE FOURTH GENEVA CONVENTION AND 

[Captioner] 20:32:18
I'VE BEEN LOOKING AT 

[Captioner] 20:32:19
INTERNATIONAL LAW FOR A LONG 

[Captioner] 20:32:19
TIME.

[Captioner] 20:32:22
AND THESE COLORED TABS HERE, 

[Captioner] 20:32:25
EACH ONE OF THESE COLORED TABS 

[Captioner] 20:32:29
IS A POTENTIAL VIOLATION OF

[Captioner] 20:32:29
 

[Captioner] 20:32:31
INTERNATIONAL LAW BY ISRAEL.

[Captioner] 20:32:35
THIS CONVENTION BY THE WAY IS 

[Captioner] 20:32:37
SPECIFICALLY FOR THE PROTECTION 

[Captioner] 20:32:40
OF CIVILIANS IN TIME OF WAR.

[Captioner] 20:32:43
AND, YOU KNOW, SO THIS BECAUSE 

[Captioner] 20:32:46
I.T. HAS NEVER BEEN -- NEVER 

[Captioner] 20:32:49
SEEN ANYTHING TO THIS EXTENT, TO 

[Captioner] 20:32:51
THIS GRAVITY, YOU KNOW, WE 

[Captioner] 20:32:52
REALLY HAVE TO ACT.

[Captioner] 20:32:55
IN THE SAME WAY THAT WE LOOK 

[Captioner] 20:32:59
BACK IN THE 19 40S AND

[Captioner] 20:33:00
 SAY WE 

[Captioner] 20:33:03
NEVER AGAIN WILL ALLOW A 

[Captioner] 20:33:03
HOLOCAUST.

WE MUST ACT NOW.

[Captioner] 20:33:18
MEETING, WE DON'T ADDRESS ITEMS 

[Captioner] 20:33:19
THAT ARE NONAGENDIZED.

[Captioner] 20:33:24
AND SO I AM GOING TO CLOSE WITH 

[Captioner] 20:33:27
NOW AT THIS TIME A REPORT-OUT ON 

[Captioner] 20:33:28
COMMITTEE ASSIGNMENTS FROM THE 

[Captioner] 20:33:31
