19:06:19 >> Mr. Quintanilla: YES, TELEPHONE NUMBER ENDING IN 365.

19:06:40 EARLIER BUT I THOUGHT WE HAD THAT RESOLVED BUT THANK YOU FOR LETTING US 
19:06:43 KNOW OUR LIVE STREAM IS DOWN.
>> Mr. Quintanilla: ONE MORE 
19:06:47 INDIVIDUAL.  BLAIR.
>> HI, BLAIR BEEKMAN.  ITEM 2B, 
19:06:49 PLEASE.
>> Mr. Quintanilla: OKAY, THANK YOU.

19:06:52 >> NO, 2D.
>> Mr. Quintanilla: 2D.

19:07:00 >> CORRECT.
>> Mayor Mei: SO SEEING NO OTHER ITEM, 
19:07:06 CAN WE GET THE COUNCIL -- SOMEONE FROM COUNCIL TO APPROVE THE CONSENT 
19:07:10 CALENDAR EXCEPT FOR 2D AS IN DOG?
>> Councilmember Cox: I MOVE THAT WILL 
19:07:18 WE APPROVE THE MEETING AGENDA EXCEPT FOR PULLING OUT  2D.

19:07:20 >> Councilmember Jones: SECOND.
>> Mayor Mei: SO WE'RE MOVING THE 
19:07:24 CONSENT CALENDAR.
>> Councilmember Cox: I'M SORRY, THE 
19:07:27 CONSENT CALENDAR.
>> Councilmember Salwan: MADAME MAYOR, 
19:07:32 I THINK YOU AND I WERE RECUSING ON 2C FOR THE LANDSCAPE DISTRICT, OUR 
19:07:36 RESIDENTS.
>> Mayor Mei: YOU AND I ARE  NOTED AS 
19:07:41 RECUSED ON THAT ONE, ITEM 2C, BECAUSE WE LIVE IN THAT DISTRICT.  SO CAN I 
19:07:47 HAVE A ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE?
>> Mr. Quintanilla:COUNCILMEMBE R COX, 
19:07:54 AYE.  COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN, AYE.  COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, AYE.  
19:07:59 COUNCILMEMBER JONES, AYE.  COUNCILMEMBER KENG, AYE.  VICE MAYOR 
19:08:06 SHAO, AYE.  MAYOR MEI, AYE.  SO THE CONSENT CALENDAR PASSES WITH THE 
19:08:11 EXCEPTION OF ITEM 2D AS IN DOG, AND WITH COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN AND MYSELF 
19:08:18 BEING RECUSED FROM ITEM 2C.  NEXT IS PUBLIC COMMENTS, AND THOSE ARE ITEMS 
19:08:24 THAT ARE NOT ON TONIGHT'S  AGENDA.  SO I'D LIKE TO CALL THE SPEAK ARES.  I 
19:08:33 THINK WE HAVE -- THERE WAS A GENTLEMAN, SURAJ EARLIER, AND WE HAVE TO STOP AT 
19:08:38 7:15.  PERT BERT YES, SURAJ?
>> HI.  GOOD EVENING.  MY NEIGHBORS 
19:08:42 AND I ARE UNHAPPY AND DISAPPOINTED IN THE COUNCIL'S DECISION LAST TUESDAY TO 
19:08:46 CHANGE THE STREET DESIGN OF PASEO PADRE PARKWAY BETWEEN WASHINGTON BOULEVARD 
19:08:51 AND BRISTOL ROAD BY REPLACING THE ORIGINAL VISION ZERO PLAN WITH THE NEW 
19:08:56 PROPOSAL THAT NARROWS THE TWO VEHICLE LANES JUST TO SQUEEZE IN A 4-FOOT 
19:08:59 BASIC BIKE LANE.  WHY WAS THERE NO OUTREACH TO THE COMMUNITY ABOUT THE 
19:09:02 NEW  PROPOSAL?  ESPECIALLY FOR THE IMPACTED NEIGHBORHOODS LIKE  MINE.  
19:09:08 FOR INSTANCE, WE LIVE RIGHT ON PASEO PADRE ITSELF AND WE ONLY HEARD ABOUT 
19:09:11 THIS BY CHANCE WHEN SOMEONE LEFT A FLYER ABOUT THE COUNCIL VOTING ON THE 
19:09:16 NEW PROPOSAL.  AND WHEN WE ATTENDED THE MEETING LAST WEEK, IT WAS TOO LATE.  
19:09:21 THE COUNCIL HAD ALREADY REJECTED THE ORIGINAL PROJECT VISION ZERO ROAD PLAN 
19:09:25 BACK IN JULY AND INSTEAD REPLACED IT WITH THE NEW PROPOSAL.  WHY WEREN'T WE 
19:09:30 MADE AWARE OF THIS DESPITE LIVING RIGHT ON PASEO PADRE?  80% OF THE PUBLIC 
19:09:34 SPEAKERS IN LAST  WEEK'S MEETING WERE AGAINST THE NEW PROPOSAL BECAUSE IT'S 
19:09:38  UNSAFE.  AND YET THE COUNCIL WAS IN A HURRY TO APPROVE THE PROPOSAL FOR THE 
19:09:42 SAKE OF A CONSTRUCTION BUSINESS CONTRACT.  IN SPITE OF THE NEW 
19:09:45 PROPOSAL NOT LIVING UP TO THE PROJECT VISION ZERO'S STANDARDS AND IGNORING 
19:09:49 THE SAFETY AND NEEDS OF OUR NEIGHBORHOOD.  WHO BENEFITS FROM THE 
19:09:54 NEW PROPOSAL?  IT'S WORSE FOR EVERYONE HERE, BIKERS, RESIDENTS, DRIVERS AND 
19:09:59 PEDESTRIANS, ALL SQUEEZED TOGETHER WITH THREE LANES OF TRAFFIC, SPEEDING ON A 
19:10:03 GRADE UNDER LOW VISIBILITY.  ON BEHALF OF THE RESIDENTS IN THE STRETCH OF 
19:10:08 PASEO PADRE PARKWAY, I HUMBLY REQUEST ALL COUNCILMEMBERS TO VISIT OUR 
19:10:11 NEIGHBORHOOD AND SEE FOR YOURSELVES.  WE CANNOT ACCEPT THE NEW PROPOSAL.  
19:10:17 IT'S JUST NOT SAFE.  THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.  DO WE HAVE 
19:10:22 ANOTHER PUBLIC SPEAKER, ALBERTO?
>> Mr. Quintanilla: YES.  NEXT SPEAKER 
19:10:29 IS BLAIR BEEKMAN.
>>  HI.  BLAIR BEEKMAN HERE.  I HOPE 
19:10:35 LOCAL AND STATE GOVERNMENTS AND OUR STATE GOVERNMENT -- STATE GOVERNOR 
19:10:39 WHO, THANKFULLY IS NOW -- BOY, I'VE GOT A BELL RINGING OUTSIDE.  I'M VERY 
19:10:43  SORRY.  WHO THANKFULLY IS NOW ALLOWED TO FINISH HIS TERM CAN ALL BE WORKING 
19:10:49 MUCH THIS FALL TO CONTINUE THE EFFORTS TO BETTER DEFINE AND MAKE CLEAR WHAT 
19:10:56 TO EXPECT IN TAKING BOTH TYPES OF VACCINES.  AND HOW TO MAKE CLEAR WHAT 
19:11:02 CAN BE THE DIFFERENT PATHS IN THE FUTURE VARIANTS OF THE VIRUS.  WE MAY 
19:11:06 BE AT A TIME THAT GOOD PUBLIC COMMUNITY HEALTH CAN ALLOW FOR GOOD CREATIVE 
19:11:13 OPTIONS THAT CAN INCLUDE WEEKLY TESTS FOR COVID AND 72-HOUR TESTS BEFORE 
19:11:17 CERTAIN SPORTING EVENTS OR MUSIC EVENTS.  AND PERHAPS MORE IMPORTANTLY, 
19:11:23 WE NEED TO LEARN HOW TO BETTER DESCRIBE THIS FULL AND HONEST ACCOUNT OF THE 
19:11:27 DAY TO DAY LIFESTYLE ONE CAN NOW EXPECT IN TAKING THE VACCINE.  THIS CAN HELP 
19:11:33 MAKE THINGS MORE CLEAR FOR PEOPLE AND TAKING THE VACCINE CAN BE WORTH IT.  
19:11:38 AND FOR BETTER UNDERSTANDINGS FOR THOSE UNCOMFORTABLE IN HAVING TAKEN THE 
19:11:43 VACCINES.  I HOPE THIS CAN BE CONSIDERED AS IDEAS OF COMMUNITY 
19:11:55 HEALTH AND  SUSTAINABILITY, AND THANKS FOR YOUR PATIENCE IN HEARING ME OUT.  
19:12:00 WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT HOW TO TALK ABOUT THE VACCINE PROCESS AND THE VACCINE 
19:12:04 PASSPORT PROCESS AND WE CAN COME UP WITH  INTERESTING IDEAS CONTINUALLY.  
19:12:08 THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.  NEXT ARE 
19:12:14 CONSIDERATION OF ITEMS REMOVED FROM THE CONSENT CALENDAR.  LET ME LACK AT THE 
19:12:22  LOOK AT THE TIMING AGAIN.  NEXT IS ITEM 2D.  MR. BEEKMAN, YOU HAD PULLED 
19:12:32 THAT?  MR. BEEKMAN?
>> YES, HI.  NOW HERE.  I JUST WANTED 
19:12:34 TO --
>> Mayor Mei: IT'S RELATED TO THE 
19:12:36 ITEM, RIGHT?
>> YES, YES, IT IS.  YEAH, I WILL 
19:12:48 RELATE IT AS MUCH AS I CAN TO THE ITEM.  THIS IS EAST BAY RADIO -- EAST BAY 
19:12:54  REGIONAL COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS AUTHORITY.  THIS IS RADIO WORK THAT IN 
19:13:05 SANTA CLARA COUNTY, WE CALL SEVIRA, I THINK IT'S CALLED.  HERE IT HAS THIS 
19:13:10 SORT OF NAME IN EAST BAY.  THESE ARE IMPORTANT IDEAS THAT WORK WITH 
19:13:17 REGIONAL IDEAS THAT THEN ALSO WORK WITH THE BAY RIX PROGRAMS.  THERE IS SOME 
19:13:25 REALLY INTERESTING WORK GOING ON, A LOT OF THIS WORK GOES THROUGH BAY  UOSI 
19:13:29 WHO I THOUGHT I SHOULD REPORT AT THIS TIME IF I CAN THEY'VE INTRODUCED SOME 
19:13:36 NEW WAYS OF HOW THEY PRACTICE THEIR FUNDING TO LOCAL AREAS, THE FUNDING 
19:13:39 THAT INCLUDES THE FUNDING FOR THESE SORT OF PROGRAMS, THESE RADIO 
19:13:44 PROGRAMS, AND IT'S REALLY INTERESTING AND HELPFUL AND IT'S MUCH MORE  CLEAR, 
19:13:50 IT'S IN TWO-YEAR CYCLES NOW COMPARED TO THE PREVIOUS THREE-YEAR PLANS.  
19:13:56 THEY'RE BASED ON CONSTRUCTS OF WORKING IN AN ERA AND ECONOMY OF PEACE AND NOT 
19:14:02 IN AN ERA AND ECONOMY OF WAR AS THESE PROGRAMSS WERE FIRST STARTED WITH BAY 
19:14:04 UOSI.  SO THEY'RE MAKING SOME INTERESTING CHANGES THAT I THOUGHT I 
19:14:10 WOULD REPORT AT THIS TIME, AND IT ALWAYS NEEDS HELP AND OVERSIGHT FROM 
19:14:15 THE PUBLIC FOR BETTER REVIEW, SO CHECK IT OUT IF YOU CAN.  JUST A THANK YOU 
19:14:20 AND A GOODBYE TO YOUR FORMER POLICE CHIEF, KIMBERLY PETERSEN, AND GOOD 
19:14:24 LUCK TO THE NEW FREMONT POLICE CHIEF.  THANK YOU.

19:14:32 >>  THANK YOU.  CAN I GET A MOTION TO MOVE ITEM D?  MOVED BY VICE MAYOR SHAO 
19:14:40 AND SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER JONES.  ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE.

19:14:44 >> Mr. Quintanilla:COUNCILMEMBE R COX, AYE.  COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN, AYE.  
19:14:49 COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, AYE.  COUNCILMEMBER JONES, AYE.  
19:14:57 COUNCILMEMBER KENG, AYE.  VICE MAYOR SHAO, AYE.  MAYOR MEI, AYE.  SO ITEM 
19:15:03 2D PASSES UNANIMOUSLY.  NEXT ON OUR AGENDA IS THE CITY OF FREMONT 2021 
19:15:08 REDISTRICTING PROCESS.  AND BEFORE WE START, I WANTED TO CHECK TO SEE, ARE 
19:15:12 WE ABLE TO -- IS THE PUBLIC ABLE TO VIEW THIS NOW?  DO WE KNOW IF WE'RE 
19:15:20 HAVING TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES OR HAS THAT BEEN RESOLVED?

19:15:25 >> Ms. Briggs: I DON'T KNOW, MADAME MAYOR.  ALBERTO HAS AN UPDATE BUT I DO 
19:15:29 KNOW THE WEBCAST STREAMING IS WORKING AS WELL AS OUR ZOOM PLATFORM, IT WAS 
19:15:35 JUST THE COMCAST CHANNEL WE WERE  HAVING TREK CAL DIFFICULTIES EARLIER.

19:15:38 >>  MY UNDERSTANDING FROM I.T. IS ALL STREAM SOMETHING A GO.

19:15:45 >> Mayor Mei: OKAY.  THANK YOU.  SO MANAGEMENT ANALYST AMANDA GALLOW WILL 
19:15:50   GALLO WILL BE SHARING WITH US AIN'T DUCKS TONIGHT.

19:15:55 >> THANK YOU, MAYOR MEI.  GOOD EVENING, MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL AND MAYOR MEI.  
19:15:59 AS WAS  MENTIONED, TONIGHT WE ARE  HOSTING OUR FIRST OF FOUR PUBLIC 
19:16:06 HEARINGS IN OUR 2021  REDISTRICTING PROCESS.  WE WILL BE HEARING FROM 
19:16:12 KRISTEN PARKS OF NATIONAL DEMOGRAPHICS CORPORATION IN A BIT, WHO THE CITY HAS 
19:16:17 CONSULTED WITH TO HELP FACILITATE THIS PROCESS, AS WELL AS TO PROVIDE 
19:16:25 DEMOGRAPHER SERVICES.  YOU MAY RECALL ON JULY -- STAFF BROUGHT THIS 
19:16:30 REDISTRICTING PROCESS OVERVIEW AS AN INFORMATIONAL ITEM TO YOU ALL TO 
19:16:35 EXPLAIN THE ELEMENTS AND THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE PROCESS, AND 
19:16:39 TONIGHT WE WILL BE HAVING A SIMILAR PRESENTATION, SOME INFORMATION YOU 
19:16:44 MIGHT HEAR AGAIN AS WE ARE REQUIRED TO ALSO DO OUR DUE DILIGENCE AND GIVE 
19:16:48 THIS INFORMATION TO THE PUBLIC IN THE SENSE AFTER PUBLIC HEARING.  SO I JUST 
19:16:53 WANTED TO NOTE THAT.  AND WITH THAT, I WILL TURN IT OVER TO KRISTEN TO GIVE 
19:17:00 US A QUICK PRESENTATION.  THANK YOU.
>>  THANK YOU, AMANDA.  GOOD EVENING, 
19:17:03 MAYOR, COUNCIL, MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC.  MY NAME IS KRISTEN PARKS.  I'M A 
19:17:07 CONSULTANT WITH NATIONAL DEMOGRAPHICS CORPORATION.  AND I'M GOING TO SHARE 
19:17:13 AN OVERVIEW OF THE REDISTRICTING PROCESS.  SO I AM NOW SHARING MY 
19:17:27 SCREEN.  DON'T WORRY, I ONLY HAVE, I THINK, NINE POWERPOINT SLIDES, SO WE 
19:17:35 WILL GO THROUGH THIS RELATIVELY QUICKLY.  WE ARE HERE IN  FREMONT, I 
19:17:40 AM ACTUALLY NOT HERE WITH YOU IN PERSON, BUT VIRTUALLY.  MY HEART IS 
19:17:48 ABSOLUTELY IN THE BAY.  YOUR CURRENT DISTRICT MAP AS A  REMINDER HAS SIX 
19:17:54 COUNCIL DISTRICTS.  THIS MAP WAS ADOPTED IN 2017.  HOWEVER, IT'S 
19:18:00 IMPORTANT TO REMIND EVERYONE THAT IN 2017, THE MOST RECENT CENSUS DATA 
19:18:07 WOULD HAVE COME FROM 2010.  SO NOW THAT WE'VE COMPLETED THE 2020 CENSUS, IT'S 
19:18:16 TIME TO UPDATE THIS DISTRICT  MAP.  SO WE ARE OFTEN RUNNING ON OUR TIMELINE 
19:18:24 FOR REDISTRICTING DESPITE DELAYS FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN RELEASING 
19:18:28 OFFICIAL POPULATION DATA.  THE DATA THAT WE EXPECTED AND NORMALLY WOULD 
19:18:35 HAVE BEEN RELEASED BY THE CENSUS BUREAU AT THE END OF MARCH WAS RELEASED ON 
19:18:47  AUGUST 12TH.  THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR THE FIRST TIME THIS DECADE IS 
19:18:56 DOING AN ADJUSTMENT OF THAT CENSUS DATA PRIMARILY TO COUNT STATE PRISONERS AT 
19:19:02 THEIR LAST KNOWN ADDRESS RATHER THAN AT THE LOCATION OF THE PRISON.  SO THAT 
19:19:06 DATA, AS YOU CAN SEE, WAS RELEASED YESTERDAY, AND THEY ACTUALLY RELEASED 
19:19:11 IT, I BELIEVE LAST NIGHT RIGHT AT MIDNIGHT.  SO THAT'S THE OFFICIAL 
19:19:17 REDISTRICTING DATA THAT EVERY CITY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS REQUIRED BY 
19:19:23 LAW TO USE.  SO I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU SOME NUMBERS TONIGHT FOR THE SIX 
19:19:29 DISTRICTS IN FREMONT THAT COME FROM THE AUGUST 12TH DATA RELEASE, SO JUST 
19:19:38 PLEASE KEEP IN MIND THAT AS SOON AS NDC PROCESSES LAST NIGHT'S DATA RELEASE, 
19:19:42 WHICH THANK GOODNESS IS THE FINAL ONE, THOSE NUMBERS MAY CHANGE SLIGHTLY.  WE 
19:19:47 DO NOT EXPECT THEM TO CHANGE SIGNIFICANTLY.  SO CALIFORNIA LAW ALSO 
19:19:54 REQUIRES FOUR PUBLIC HEARINGS BEFORE A NEW DISTRICT MAP IS ADOPTED, AND 
19:20:01 FREMONT HAS AN APRIL 17TH, 2022 DEADLINE TO ADOPT THAT NEW MAP.  ALONG 
19:20:08 THE WAY, WE WILL BE LAUNCHING PUBLIC MAPPING TOOLS TO HELP THE PUBLIC 
19:20:15 PARTICIPATE DIRECTLY IN THIS PROCESS AND SUBMIT THEIR VISION FOR WHAT THE 
19:20:21 COUNCIL DISTRICTS WILL LOOK LIKE.  OUR NEXT PUBLIC HEARING IS NOT UNTIL 
19:20:26  DECEMBER 7TH, BUT WE ARE NOT GOING QUIET IN THIS PROCESS.  THIS WILL BE A 
19:20:32 TIME OF ENGAGEMENT FOR THE PUBLIC.  I ENCOURAGE EVERYONE WHO IS JOINING US 
19:20:40 ON THIS ZOOM TO TAKE A MOMENT TO VISIT  REDISTRICTFREMONT.ORG.  THAT IS THE 
19:20:45 REDISTRICTING WEBSITE.  IT HAS TONS OF INFORMATION, AND AS SOON AS WE PROCESS 
19:20:57 THIS FINAL DATA WITHIN A COUPLE WEEKS, THIS IS WHERE YOU WILL BE SEEING 
19:21:00 ONLINE MAPPING TOOLS AS WELL AS DOWNLOADABLE MAPS THAT YOU CAN WRITE 
19:21:06 DIRECTLY ON AND THERE'S ALSO A CONTACT FORM ON THE WEBPAGE THAT FOLKS IN THE 
19:21:10 COMMUNITY CAN START SUBMITTING THEIR COMMENTS, PERSPECTIVES, GOALS, AND 
19:21:20 WHAT THEY -- THEIR PRIORITIES ARE FOR  REDISTRICTING.  SO I DO QUICKLY WANT 
19:21:24 TO GO OVER THE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS OF REDISTRICTING.  THIS IS IN MANY WAYS 
19:21:30 TO EMPOWER THE PUBLIC.  WE WANT THE PUBLIC PARTICIPATING, DRAWING MAPS, SO 
19:21:35 WE WANT THE PUBLIC TO UNDERSTAND EXACTLY WHAT GUIDELINES THERE ARE FOR 
19:21:42 DISTRICT DRAWING.  SO FIRST IS FEDERAL LAW, WHICH IS, OF COURSE, SUPREME AND 
19:21:46 FEDERAL LAWL STATES THAT EACH DISTRICT SHOULD BE RELATIVELY EQUAL IN 
19:21:51 POPULATION SIZE.  SO THAT'S THE FIRST CONSIDERATION.  WE ALSO MUST COMPLY 
19:21:59 WITH THE FEDERAL VOTING RIGHTS ACT, WHICH SAYS THAT WE SHALL NOT 
19:22:01 DISCRIMINATE AGAINST OR DILUTE THE VOTING POWER OF ANY PROTECTED CLASS OF 
19:22:09 VOTERS, SO WE WILL BE LOOKING AT RACE AND ETHNICITY DATA FOR CITIZENS OF 
19:22:16 VOTING AGE TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT.  HOWEVER, 
19:22:23 FEDERAL CASE LAW ALSO SAYS THAT WE CANNOT ENGAGE IN RACIAL 
19:22:26 GERRYMANDERING, WHICH MEANS WE CAN'T DRAW DISTRICT BOUNDARIES WITH RACE 
19:22:32 BEING THE PREDOMINANT FACTOR OR THE MAIN THING OR THE ONLY THING WE'RE 
19:22:35 LOOKING AT.  SO WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT A LOT OF DIFFERENT DEMOGRAPHIC 
19:22:42  FEATURES OF YOUR COMMUNITIES WHERE RACE AND ETHNICITY WILL BE ONE OF 
19:22:47 MANY.  IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA, WE ALSO HAVE A NEW LAW GOVERNING 
19:22:55 REDISTRICTING, THE FAIR MAPS ACT.  AND THIS LAW GIVES US A LIST OF CRITERIA 
19:23:02 THAT HAVE TO BE CONSIDERED BY EVERY CITY THAT IS REDISTRICTING.  AND THESE 
19:23:08 CRITERIA ARE LISTED IN ORDER OF IMPORTANCE SO WE HAVE TO FOLLOW THESE 
19:23:15 CRITERIA IN ORDER, SO WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THESE THINGS.  THE FIRST IS TO 
19:23:19 DRAW DISTRICTS THAT ARE CONTIGUOUS.  CONTIGUOUS SIMPLY MEANS THAT EACH 
19:23:27 DISTRICT SHOULD BE ONE PIECE ALL CONNECTED WITH NO SEPARATE PIECES OF 
19:23:36 THE DISTRICT THAT ARE DISCONNECTED.  SO THAT'S PRETTY BASIC.  OBVIOUSLY YOUR 
19:23:39 CURRENT MAP ACCOMPLISHES THAT.  IT'S THE SECOND CRITERION THAT WE'RE GOING 
19:23:43 TO FOCUS ON THIS EVENING FOR THE FIRST PUBLIC HEARING, AND THAT IS THAT 
19:23:49 CALIFORNIA LAW SAYS WHEN WE'RE DRAWING DISTRICT BOUNDARIES, WE WANT TO 
19:23:56 MINIMIZE THE DIVISION OF NEIGHBORHOODS AND COMMUNITIES OF INTEREST.  MEANING 
19:24:02 THAT WE DO NOT WANT TO DRAW A DISTRICT BOUNDARY LINE RIGHT THROUGH A 
19:24:07 SIGNIFICANT NEIGHBORHOOD OR COMMUNITY.  WE'LL TALK IN JUST A MOMENT ABOUT HOW 
19:24:15 THE LAW DEFINES A COMMUNITY OF INTEREST AND HOW THE PUBLIC CAN SHARE TESTIMONY 
19:24:22 ABOUT COMMUNITIES OF INTEREST WITH THE COUNCIL THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS.  THE 
19:24:26 THIRD CRITERION IS TO CREATE EASILY IDENTIFIABLE BOUNDARIES FOR OUR 
19:24:33 DISTRICT.  THAT JUST MEANS WE WANT THOSE DISTRICT LINES TO FOLLOW  
19:24:40 EXISTING THINGS, PERHAPS MAJOR ROADS, WATERWAYS, THAT KIND OF THING SO THAT 
19:24:47 THE BOUNDARIES CAN BE EASILY DESCRIBED.  THAT YOU DON'T NEED TO BE AN EXPERT 
19:24:53 IN GEOGRAPHY TO KNOW WHERE YOUR DISTRICT STARTS AND ENDS.  AND 
19:24:58 FINALLY, STATE LAW SAYS DISTRICTS SHOULD BE COMPACT.  WHEN WE'RE TALKING 
19:25:04 ABOUT  COMPACT, WE'RE TALKING AGAIN ABOUT SHAPE BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT 
19:25:10 THE SHAPE OF THE DISTRICT SUCH THAT THE DISTRICT SHOULD NOT BE DRAWN IN A WAY 
19:25:17 TO TRY TO INCLUDE A FARTHER AWAY POPULATION WHILE AVOIDING A CLOSER 
19:25:21 POPULATION.  SO THAT WOULD BE WHERE YOU WOULD HAVE A STRANGE ARM MAYBE 
19:25:29 WRAPPING AROUND TO PULL IN A POPULATION WHILE AVOIDING SOME AREA IN THE 
19:25:35 MIDDLE.  AGAIN, THAT IS THE LAST CRITERION ON THE CALIFORNIA STATE 
19:25:45 LIST.  SO TO THE EXTENT ALL OF THESE CRITERIA ARE PRACTICAL AND DO NOT 
19:25:48 CONFLICT WITH OUR FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS, WE FOLLOW THEM IN THE STATE OF 
19:25:53 CALIFORNIA.  WE ALSO CANNOT FAVOR OR DISCRIMINATE AGAINST A POLITICAL PARTY 
19:25:58 THAT IS IN THE FAIR MAPS ACT AS WELL, SO FOR THAT REASON, THIS IS IMPORTANT 
19:26:03 FOR THE PUBLIC TO KNOW AS WELL, THAT WE WILL NOT BE LOOKING AT PARTISAN DATA.  
19:26:08 WE WON'T BE LOOKING AT WHERE OUR REGISTERED VOTERS WHO ARE DEMOCRATIC 
19:26:17 OR REPUBLICAN.  WE'RE NOT EVEN LOOKING AT ANY OF THAT DATA.  THERE IS A THIRD 
19:26:21 COLUMN HERE FOR OTHER GOALS.  THE ONLY REASON I PUT THAT HERE IS JUST TO 
19:26:24 POINT OUT THAT IF THERE ARE OTHER CONSIDERATIONS AND PRIORITIES THAT ARE 
19:26:29 UNIQUE TO THE CITY OF FREMONT, THESE CAN BE CONSIDERED AS PART OF THE 
19:26:35 REDISTRICTING PROCESS, BUT THEY CAN ONLY BE CONSIDERED AFTER WE'VE 
19:26:40 ADDRESSED FEDERAL AND STATE REQUIREMENTS.  SO THERE ARE OTHER 
19:26:44 THINGS WE CAN CONSIDER, BUT ONLY INSOFAR AS WE DON'T CONFLICT WITH 
19:26:51 THOSE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS.  SO THE DEFINITION FOR COMMUNITIES OF 
19:26:55 INTEREST, AS I JUST MENTIONED, THE SECOND CRITERION FOR THE STATE OF 
19:26:58 CALIFORNIA IS THAT OUR DISTRICT BOUNDARIES DON'T SPLIT UP COMMUNITIES 
19:27:03 OF INTEREST.  MOST OF US KNOW WHAT A NEIGHBORHOOD IS, THE STATE LAW SAYS 
19:27:13 THE SAME, BUT A COMMUNITY OF INTEREST IS DESCRIBED AS A POPULATION IN A 
19:27:18 GEOGRAPHIC AREA THAT SHARES COMMON INTEREST, THAT SHOULD BE INCLUDED 
19:27:23 WITHIN A SINGLE DISTRICT SO THAT THAT COMMUNITY HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE 
19:27:29 EFFECTIVELY REPRESENTED BY COUNCIL.  SO A COMMUNITY OF INTEREST IS A VERY 
19:27:37 BROAD TERM.  MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC CAN IDENTIFY THEIR COMMUNITIES OF INTEREST 
19:27:41 BY TELLING US WHAT SOME OF THE CHARACTERISTICS ARE OF THE COMMUNITY.  
19:27:45 PERHAPS THERE IS A COMMON LANGUAGE THAT PEOPLE SPEAK, A SHARED HISTORY, 
19:27:51 PERHAPS THERE ARE SIMILAR ISSUES THAT AFFECT THAT COMMUNITY, BE THEY FOLKS 
19:27:57 WHO LIVE AROUND A CERTAIN HIGHWAY OR DEALING WITH CERTAIN TRAFFIC CONCERNS 
19:28:05 OR FOLKS THAT LIVE AROUND A CERTAIN PARK AND HAVE INTERESTS THAT BRING 
19:28:11 THEM TOGETHER.  SO THIS IS A SUBJECTIVE DEFINITION.  IT  RELIES ON THE PUBLIC 
19:28:19 TO TELL US WHAT THE COMMUNITY OF INTEREST IS.  SO AGAIN MEMBERS OF THE 
19:28:21 PUBLIC THAT ARE LISTENING TO THIS, I ENCOURAGE YOU TO TAKE A MOMENT TO 
19:28:26 THINK NOT JUST ABOUT WHAT NEIGHBORHOOD YOU IDENTIFY WITH, BUT IF THERE ARE 
19:28:33 OTHER WAYS THAT YOU DEFINE YOUR COMMUNITY BEYOND JUST WHAT YOU MIGHT 
19:28:37 THINK OF AS THE GEOGRAPHIC BOUNDARIES OF YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD, YOU MIGHT WANT 
19:28:43 TO THINK ABOUT THOSE COMMON INTERESTS THAT YOU AND YOUR NEIGHBORS SHARE, 
19:28:48 SHARED EXPERIENCES THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE, SHARED ISSUES THAT YOU MIGHT INTERACT 
19:28:52 WITH THE CITY ON, AND THINK ABOUT WHAT THE BOUNDARIES OF THAT COMMUNITY MIGHT 
19:29:00 BE SO THAT YOU CAN PARTICIPATE IN REDISTRICTING BY TELLING US, HERE IS 
19:29:06 MY COMMUNITY, AND I WANT MY COMMUNITY WITHIN A SINGLE DISTRICT.  NOT ALL 
19:29:11 COMMUNITIES WANT TO BE IN A SINGLE COUNCIL DISTRICT, BUT STATE LAW IS 
19:29:17 CONCERNED WITH THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT DO WANT TO BE UNDIVIDED AND KEPT WHOLE 
19:29:24 WITHIN A SINGLE DISTRICT.  WHEN WE THINK ABOUT OUR SIX COUNCIL DISTRICTS, 
19:29:32 EACH DISTRICT WILL BE MADE UP OF MANY COMMUNITIES AND NEIGHBORHOODS.  I 
19:29:36 QUICKLY WANT TO SHOW THE DEMOGRAPHIC SUMMARY.  I KNOW THAT THIS IS TOO MANY 
19:29:41 NUMBERS FOR ANYONE TO REALLY PROCESS, SO I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT THAT WHAT 
19:29:52 WE'RE LOOKING AT IS A TOTAL POPULATION FOR THE CITY OF 230,504.  IF YOU 
19:29:57 DIVIDE THAT BY 6, YOU GET THE IDEAL POPULATION SIZE FOR EACH DISTRICT.  
19:30:01 REMEMBER FEDERAL LAW SAYS THAT DISTRICTS SHOULD BE AS EQUAL AS 
19:30:11 POSSIBLE IN POPULATION.  SO HERE WE HAVE AN IDEAL DISTRICT SIZE OF 38,417 
19:30:18 PEOPLE.  SO THE MAIN THING THAT YOU CAN TAKE AWAY FROM THIS TABLE IS HOW THOSE 
19:30:24 CURRENT DISTRICTS MATCH UP WITH THAT IDEAL POPULATION.  YOU'LL SEE THAT 
19:30:33 SOME OF THE CURRENT DISTRICTS HAVE MORE PEOPLE THAN IDEAL AND SOME HAVE FEWER. 
19:30:39  THAT DEVIATION CAN HELP GUIDE US WHEN WE ARE LOOKING AT HOW TO ADJUST 
19:30:46 DISTRICT BOUNDARIES.  THE DEVIATION IS REPRESENTED IN NUMBER OF PEOPLE AS 
19:30:58 WELL AS A PERCENTAGE.  SO WE WILL BE LAUNCHING MAPPING TOOLS TO EMPOWER THE 
19:31:02 PUBLIC TO NOT ONLY DRAW DISTRICTS BUT ALSO DRAW COMMUNITY OF INTERESTS OR 
19:31:11 YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD.  THE DISTRICTR TOOL, IT'S A VERY EASY TO USE ONLINE TOOL 
19:31:15 THAT YOU INTERACT WITH, VERY SIMILAR TO GOOGLE MAPS, BUT THERE IS A PAINTBRUSH 
19:31:21 WHERE YOU CAN DRAW YOUR COMMUNITY'S AND DISTRICTS DIRECTLY ON THE WEBSITE AND 
19:31:28 SUBMIT THAT, ALONG WITH A DESCRIPTION AND A NAME FOR YOUR COMMUNITY, OR YOU 
19:31:32 CAN DRAW COUNCIL DISTRICTS.  FOR THOSE WHO DON'T WANT TO USE TECHNOLOGY 
19:31:39 TOOLS, WE ALSO WILL HAVE THE ANALOG PAPER-BASED MAPS COMING SOON ONCE WE 
19:31:46 PROCESS THAT NEW DATA RELEASE THAT CAME IN LAST NIGHT.  AGAIN, THE WEBSITE 
19:31:52 THAT I WANT EVERYONE TO CHECK OUT IS REDISTRICTFREMONT.ORG.  IT WILL BE 
19:31:57 CONTINUALLY UPDATED THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS, AND IT HAS A SCHEDULE OF 
19:32:02 EVERY MEETING THAT WILL BE HELD RELATED TO REDISTRICTING AND ALL OF THE 
19:32:10 SUPPORTING MATERIALS INCLUDING THIS PRESENTATION.  WITH THAT, WE CAN MOVE 
19:32:17 TO THE PUBLIC  HEARING AND DISCUSSION, WANTING TO FOCUS RIGHT NOW ON HEARING 
19:32:20 FROM THE PUBLIC ABOUT YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD AND YOUR COMMUNITIES AND IF THERE ARE 
19:32:28 AREAS THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO BE KEPT WITHIN A SINGLE DISTRICT SO YOU CAN BE 
19:32:46 EFFECTIVELY REPRESENTED.  AND WITH THAT, I'LL STOP MY SCREEN SHARE.

19:32:48 >> Ms. Briggs: MAYOR MEI, YOU'RE MUTED.

19:32:50 >> Mayor Mei: AT THIS TIME, I'D LIKE TO ENTERTAIN QUESTIONS FROM THE 
19:33:04 COUNCILMEMBERS.  SEEING  NONE, WE'LL GO TO THE PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD.  MEMBERS 
19:33:08 OF THE PUBLIC WISHING TO SPEAK THIS EVENING MAY DO SO BY PRESSING ON THE 
19:33:15 RAISE HAND ICON, OR CALLING IN BY PRESSING STAR NINE.  AND I THINK WE 
19:33:22 HAVE A COUPLE SPEAKERS, I SAW EARLIER.  WE'LL BEGIN WITH CINDY.  CINDY, 
19:33:28 WELCOME.  THANK YOU SO MUCH.
>>  THIS IS DANIEL.  I'M USING MY 
19:33:32 WIFE'S ZOOM ACCOUNT.  CAN YOU HEAR ME?
>> Mayor Mei: YES.

19:33:36 >> AWESOME.  SO ONE QUESTION HERE.  I'M NOT SURE IF IT'S COMPLETELY RELATED 
19:33:42 BUT WITH THE REMAPPING OF THE DISTRICTS AND THE BOUNDARIES, DOES THIS AFFECT 
19:33:48 SCHOOLS BY ANY CHANCE?  SCHOOL BOUNDARIES?

19:33:51 >> Mayor Mei: THIS IS ENTIRELY SEPARATE FROM THE SCHOOL BOUNDARIES.  SCHOOL 
19:33:54 BOUNDARIES ARE SET BY THE SCHOOL DISTRICT AND IT'S NOT -- THEY WOULD 
19:33:59 HAVE TO REVISIT THEMSELVES.  I CAN'T COMMENT ON THAT BUT THERE'S NOTHING 
19:34:02 RIGHT NOW THAT AFFECTS SCHOOLS.  THIS IS ONLY OUR VOTING DISTRICT FOR THE 
19:34:05 CITY.
>> WILL THIS BE THE NEXT STEP AFTER 
19:34:10 THIS DONE AND CONCLUDED, THE SCHOOLS WOULD THEN TAKE, YOU KNOW, THE NEW 
19:34:16 MAPPING IN CONSIDERATION?
>> Mayor Mei: AGAIN, I APOLOGIZE, I 
19:34:19 CAN'T SPEAK TO THE SCHOOL DISTRICT'S DECISION, BUT THE SCHOOL DISTRICT IN 
19:34:23 THE PAST HAVING SERVED ON THE SCHOOL BOARD IS USUALLY TIED MORE  CLOSELY TO 
19:34:27 THE HIGH SCHOOLS THEMSELVES AND THEY TEND TO BE IN LINE WITH THAT.

19:34:31 >>  OKAY.  THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: BUT AGAIN, FOR THE 
19:34:35 PROPER REFERENCE, PLEASE TALK TO THE SCHOOL DISTRICT AND THE SCHOOL BOARD 
19:34:40 TRUSTEES AND THEIR SUPERINTENDENT.  THAT WOULD BE THE BEST PLACE.  NEXT I 
19:34:46 SEE THE SPEAKER IS BLAIR BEEKMAN.
>>  HI.  THANK YOU.  BLAIR BEEKMAN 
19:34:51 HERE.  IT'S KIND OF EXCITING TO BE AROUND ISSUES OF REDISTRICTING IN 
19:35:01 FREMONT.  SO THANK YOU FOR THIS ITEM.  I DO A LOT OF WORK IN SAN JOSÉ, AND 
19:35:04 SAN JOSÉ IS GOING THROUGH THEIR OWN REDISTRICTING COMMISSIONED PROCESS AT 
19:35:11 THIS TIME.  THEIR MEETINGS ARE ON THEIR PUBLIC WEBSITE THAT -- AND ON YOUTUBE 
19:35:19 THAT I VERY MUCH WOULD SUGGEST PEOPLE CHECK OUT TO GET KIND OF AN INFERENCE 
19:35:25 HOW IDEAS CAN WORK AND HOW WE'RE CONSIDERING NEW CONCEPTS OF EQUITY AT 
19:35:32 THIS TIME, AND HOW THAT CAN BE A PART OF A FORM LA BEING USED AND DEVISED 
19:35:40 AND CONSIDERED.  THE IDEAS OF, BOY, NATURAL DISASTER PREPAREDNESS AND ITS 
19:35:45 CONCEPTS OF EQUITY WITHIN NATURAL DISASTER PREPAREDNESS, HOW WILL THAT 
19:35:53 FIT IN TO THE FUTURE OF  REDISTRICTING FOR THIS NEXT DECADE?  IN MY OWN 
19:35:57 LITTLE WORLD, THERE'S QUITE A POSSIBILITY OF AN EARTHQUAKE IN THE 
19:36:01 NEXT FEW YEARS.  MAYBE IT'S IN THE NEXT 10 YEARS, I'M NOT SURE, BUT AN 
19:36:06 EARTHQUAKE IS COMING SOON, IT SEEMS, AND NOT ONLY THAT, THE ISSUES OF SEA 
19:36:09 LEVEL RISE.  HOW IS THAT GOING TO BE AFFECTING REDISTRICTING 
19:36:15 DECISION-MAKING IN THIS NEXT DECADE?  GOOD LUCK IN WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO, AND 
19:36:21 THE CONSIDERATIONS YOU'LL BE MAKING.  I REALLY LIKE EQUITY TO BE THE IDEAS OF 
19:36:27 HOW THINGS CAN BE EQUAL FOR -- HOW PEOPLE CAN BE GIVEN OPPORTUNITY WHO 
19:36:32 DON'T HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY.  HOW CAN THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES BE PRESENTED 
19:36:39 WHEN IT'S DIFFICULT FOR SOME TO EVEN HAVE THOSE OPPORTUNITIES.  AND THAT'S 
19:36:46 ALONG OF LINES OF HOW I THINK OF EQUITY.  TO QUICKLY OFFER IF I CAN, TO 
19:36:49 ADDRESS REDISTRICTING ISSUES WITHIN THIS NEXT YEAR, AND PEOPLE MOVING 
19:36:55 AROUND A LOT, IT'S MY HOPE THAT PEOPLE CAN STILL, IF THEY ASK FOR TENANT 
19:36:59 PROTECTION EXTENSION AFTER SEPTEMBER 30TH, IT CAN BE RECEIVED AND THEY 
19:37:05 WON'T HAVE TO BE SUED BY OWNERS, AND THAT CAN GO THROUGH TILL MARCH 2022, 
19:37:10 THAT CAN BE EFFECTIVE FOR.  YOU'LL TALK MORE ABOUT THIS NEXT WEEK, I'M SURE, 
19:37:14 AT YOUR MEETINGS.  I'M SORRY, I DIDN'T BRING THIS UP AT PUBLIC COMMENT TIME.  
19:37:19 OVERALL, JUST GOOD LUCK IN THESE REDISTRICTING EFFORTS, AND IT'S NICE 
19:37:25 TO BE HERE AND TO BE -- JUST HEARING THESE SORT OF THINGS.  THANK YOU.

19:37:31 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.  NEXT SPEAKER IS KELLY ABREU.   WELCOME, KELLY.

19:37:39 >> WELL, IT TURNS OUT THAT REDISTRICTING IN FREMONT DOESN'T NEED 
19:37:44 TO LOOK TO NEW CONCEPTS OF EQUITY.  IT NEEDS TO LOOK AT NEW CONCEPTS -- NEW 
19:37:50 REQUIREMENTS OF LAW.  AND THAT FAIR MAX ACT WHICH JUST CAME IN TO EFFECT A 
19:37:56 COUPLE OF YEARS AGO, WHICH WAS ABOUT TWO YEARS AFTER THE LAST 
19:38:01 REDISTRICTING.  OR DISTRICTING, IF YOU WANT TO BE TECHNICAL ABOUT IT.  AND IT 
19:38:06 TURNS OUT AT THE LAST DISTRICTING, THAT VOTE WAS 3-2.  IT WAS A SPLIT VOTE 
19:38:14 THAT SHOWS THE GERRYMANDERED  MAP.  NOW, OF COURSE THERE WAS A GOOD 
19:38:21 POLITICAL MANEUVER TO PROVIDE COVER, SOME KIND OF A TROJAN HORSE OR 
19:38:25 MANEUVER TO CAMOUFLAGE THIS GERRYMANDERED MAP AS IF IT WAS -- 
19:38:31 SERVED THE INTERESTS OF A PARTICULAR COMMUNITY THAT A COUPLE WEEKS EARLIER 
19:38:36 HAD ALL BEEN SUPPORTIVE OF THE NON-GERRYMANDERED MAP, THEY ALL CAME 
19:38:40 IN BUT THEY WERE PERSUADED TO COME IN AND ASK FOR THIS MAP THAT WE HAVE NOW, 
19:38:47 AND THIS, OF COURSE -- MOST OF THE MAP IS ACTUALLY NOT VERY CONTROVERSIAL 
19:38:54 FROM WHAT I SEE, READING IN WHAT PEOPLE WROTE IN 2017.  LOOKING AT THE 
19:39:01 NEWSPAPER ARTICLE FROM JUNE 7TH.  BUT THE DISTRICT 2, DISTRICT 3 DIVISION, 
19:39:07 THAT ZIG-ZAGY LINE, A FORMER COUNCILMAN SAID AT THE MEETING THAT IN ADDITION 
19:39:13 TO PRESERVING MORE OF THE AFGHAN COMMUNITY ALONG THE LINES OF CTB OR -- 
19:39:18  -- ENSURES TWO OF THE CANDIDATES DON'T HAVE TO FACE EACH OTHER IN THE 2018 
19:39:27 ELECTION.  AND ECHOING SOME CRITICISMS FROM OTHER SPEAKERS, CHO SAID THAT 
19:39:31 AMOUNTS TO, QUOTE, GERRYMANDERING AT ITS WORST."

19:39:37 SO THIS ZIG-ZAGY LINE THERE, THERE WAS A C2A MAP, I GUESS, DID NOT HAVE THE 
19:39:42 PROBLEM, THERE'S A C2B MAP THAT IS GERRYMANDERED, AND THIS IS OUR 
19:39:46 OPPORTUNITY TO GO BACK, CHECK ALL THE LINES, MAKE SURE THEY'RE ALL NICE AND 
19:39:52 THEY ALL CONFORM WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE FAIR MAPS ACT.  AND YOU KNOW, 
19:40:03 ONE OF THEM IS WHERE POSSIBLE TO CONFORM TO NATURAL BOUNDARIES, AND TO 
19:40:07 BE DRAWN TO REPRESENT THE COMMUNITIES FROM THE BOTTOM UP, NOT FROM THE TOP 
19:40:13 DOWN, TO SUIT THE NEEDS OF THE INCOMING POLITICIANS.  SO LET'S BE VERY CLEAR 
19:40:20 ABOUT THAT, THIS MAP THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW IS  GERRYMANDERED.  THERE'S NO 
19:40:26 DOUBT ABOUT IT, AND IT'S TIME TO FIX IT.  THANK YOU.

19:40:33 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.  I'M TRYING TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY -- OKAY.  I DON'T 
19:40:37 SEE ANY OTHER PUBLIC SPEAKERS.  ALBERTO, IS THERE ANYONE ELSE THAT I 
19:40:39 MISSED?
>> Mr. Quintanilla: NO, NO OTHER HANDS 
19:40:42 RAISED AT THE MOMENT.
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY, THANK YOU.  I WILL 
19:40:46 NOW CLOSE THE PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD, AND I WILL TURN THAT BACK TO THE 
19:40:52 COUNCIL FOR ANY COMMENTS.  BUT I BELIEVE WE'VE MOSTLY RECEIVING 
19:40:56 COMMENTS AT THIS MOMENT.
>> Mr. Stott: I'D LIKE TO INTERRUPT, 
19:40:59 MAYOR, I THINK THE PURPOSE OF THAT ITEM WAS JUST TO HEAR THE PUBLIC COMMENTS 
19:41:02 AND I DON'T KNOW THAT WE NEED COUNCIL COMMENTS BUT I'LL DEFER TO THE CITY 
19:41:12 ATTORNEY ON THAT.
>> Mayor Mei: MY APOLOGIES, DEBRA.  
19:41:14 YOU'RE ON MUTE.
>> Ms. Margolis: THERE YOU GO.  I WAS 
19:41:17 HAVING TROUBLE UNMUTING.  BRIAN IS CORRECT, COUNCILMEMBERS MAY COMMENT IF 
19:41:22 THEY WOULD LIKE TO.  THEY DON'T NEED TO AT THIS POINT IN TIME.  AND I DO WANT 
19:41:26 TO CAUTION COUNCILMEMBERS TO PLEASE NOT DISCUSS COMMUNITIES OF INTEREST IN 
19:41:33 DETAIL, AS WE HAVEN'T HAD ALL OF THE PUBLIC HEARINGS YET AND ALL THE 
19:41:38 COMMENTS YET TO COME.
>> Mayor Mei: THE ONLY COMMENT I HAVE 
19:41:41 IS THAT I'M HOPING THAT THE PUBLIC WILL PARTICIPATE.  THIS IS THE REASON WHY 
19:41:48 WE ARE INVITING THEM TO JOIN US AND TO HAVE THIS DISCUSSION.  I APPRECIATE 
19:41:53 THE MAPS AND THE FACT THAT THE DATA WILL BE UPDATED AND HOPEFULLY AS WE 
19:41:57 SEE WHAT'S HAPPENED WITH THE LATEST CENSUS COUNT, WE WILL BE REFLECTING 
19:42:02 THAT AND INVITING THE PUBLIC TO LOOK AT THOSE NEW INFORMATION IN TERMS OF 
19:42:07 WHERE THOSE LINES MAY BE POSSIBLY DRAWN.  SO I LOOK FORWARD TO THIS 
19:42:11 CONTINUED CONVERSATION.  AT THIS TIME, THIS WAS THE LAST AGENDA ITEM THIS 
19:42:20 EVENING.  AND SO ARE THERE ANY REPORTS OUT?

19:42:23 >> Councilmember Keng: I DO HAVE A COMMENT.

19:42:27 >> Mayor Mei: OKAY.  COUNCILMEMBER KENG?  SORRY, I CAN'T SEE YOUR HAND.  
19:42:29 IT KIND  OF --
>> Councilmember Keng: SO THANK YOU 
19:42:37 FOR THE PRESENTATION, AND I'M JUST WONDERING WHAT KIND OF OUTREACH ARE WE 
19:42:42 DOING TO LET THE PUBLIC KNOW ABOUT THE  REDISTRICTING AND HOW THEY CAN 
19:42:50 PARTICIPATE?
>> Mayor Mei: SO I KNOW THAT -- I 
19:42:55 DON'T KNOW IF STAFF WANTS TO ANSWER.  AMANDA, DID YOU WANT TO ANSWER?

19:43:01 >> SURE, I CAN ANSWER THAT.  WE, AS REQUIRED BY LAW, BUT THE CITY IS GOING 
19:43:06 FURTHER, WE ARE  REQUIRED TO AT LEAST PROVIDE THIS INFORMATION TRANSLATED 
19:43:12 INTO DIFFERENT NON-ENGLISH-SPEAKING LANGUAGES, SO WE HAVE DONE THAT IN 
19:43:19 ABOUT SEVEN LANGUAGES.  WE HAVE PUT OUT THE PUBLIC HEARING NOTICE IN LOCAL 
19:43:23 NON-ENGLISH-SPEAKING MEDIA PUBLICATIONS AS WELL AS SHARING IT WITH LOCAL 
19:43:29 ORGANIZATIONS ACROSS FREMONT ON THE CITY'S SOCIAL MEDIA CHANNELS, ASKING 
19:43:34 OUR VARIOUS INTERNAL DEPARTMENTS TO SHARE IT ON THEIR SOCIAL MEDIA 
19:43:40 CHANNELS AND HAVE BEEN TO A COUPLE OF OUR COMMISSIONS HERE IN FREMONT.  WE 
19:43:46 ALSO WELCOME YOU ALL TO SHARE ON YOUR PERSONAL SOCIAL MEDIA OR TO YOUR 
19:43:52 CONSTITUENTS AS WELL.
>> Councilmember Keng: GREAT.  THANK 
19:43:57 YOU, AMANDA.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.  I APPRECIATE 
19:44:00 THE OUTREACH AND SUPPORT.  I THINK THAT RIGHT  NOW, NOT JUST IN OUR CITY AND 
19:44:04 OTHER CITIES, WE'RE GOING THROUGH A SIMILAR PROCESS, AND HAVE BEEN 
19:44:09 ENGAGING PEOPLE TO GET INVOLVED AND LOOKING AT THAT.  I KNOW THAT OUR 
19:44:13 COUNTY LEVEL HAS ALSO HAD A MEETING ALREADY, AND SO I ENCOURAGE PEOPLE IF 
19:44:16 THEY'RE INTERESTED IN ANY OF THOSE QUESTIONS TO PLEASE DIRECT TO EACH OF 
19:44:20 THE AGENCIES, WHETHER IT'S BOARD OF SUPERVISORS OR IN THE QUESTION EARLIER 
19:44:24 THAT CAME UP WITH THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS, AS THEY WOULD BE THE GOVERNING 
19:44:29 AGENCIES MAKING THOSE DECISIONS, NOT OURSELVES.  SO SEEING THAT, IF THERE'S 
19:44:33 NO OTHER -- AT THIS TIME, I WAS JUST GOING TO LET PEOPLE KNOW THAT WE WILL 
19:44:37 BE OPENING OUR DOWNTOWN EVENT CENTER SOON, AND THANK YOU TO ALL THE STAFF 
19:44:42 AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS WHO JOINED US AS WE  OPENED UP THE LAST COUPLE WEEKS, 
19:44:47 WE'VE OPENED UP A BRAND NEW CAMPGROUND AS WELL AS A BRAND NEW PARK, THE LILA 
19:44:51 BRINGHURST PARK.  SO WE ENCOURAGE ALL OF YOU TO STAY HEALTHY, BE WELL, AND 
19:44:57 WITH THAT, I'D LIKE TO ADJOURN THE MEETING AT THIS  TIME.  SO PLEASE STAY 
19:45:02 WELL AND THANK YOU FOR THE STAFF.  SO IT'S ADJOURNED AT 7:45 P.M.  THANK
