[Captioner] 19:04:02
MAYOR AND COUNCIL.
PRIOR TO THE CITY COUNCIL VOTINGON

[Captioner] 19:04:05
 THE CONSENT CALENDAR, WE HAVE
A NON-AGENDA

[Captioner] 19:04:08
 ITEM CONCERNING A
LOCAL EMERGENCY FOR DISCUSSION
THIS

[Captioner] 19:04:11
 EVENING.
THE

[Captioner] 19:04:14
 PROCLAMATION OF A LOCAL
EMERGENCY, THE STAFF REPORT AND
DRAFT RESOLUTION WERE


[Captioner] 19:04:17
DISTRIBUTED VIA EMAIL TO
COUNCILMEMBERS EARLIER TODAY AND


[Captioner] 19:04:21
POSTED ONLINE AS WELL.


[Captioner] 19:04:27
THE CITY COUNCIL MAY TAKE ACTION
AT THIS MEETING ON THIS


[Captioner] 19:04:31
NON-AGENDIZED ITEM MEANING
YOU'LL NOT FIND IT ON THE
AGENDA, BUT

[Captioner] 19:04:35
 IT'S AN EMERGENCY
ACTION THEREFORE IT CAN BE ADDED
FOR PURPOSES OF

[Captioner] 19:04:37
 DISCUSSION AND
ACTION THIS EVENING.
TO DO SO, HOWEVER, THE COUNCIL


[Captioner] 19:04:41
MUST FIRST ADOPT A MOTION TO
DETERMINE
THAT AN EMERGENCY SITUATION

[Captioner] 19:04:43

EXISTS.
STAFF RECOMMENDS THAT THE


[Captioner] 19:04:47
COUNCIL DO SO ON THE
GROUNDS THAT THE LOCAL EMERGENCY
PRAK LAMATION BEING

[Captioner] 19:04:51
 CONSIDERED
THIS EVENING CONCERNS RECENT AND
ANTICIPATED STORM EVENTS THAT


[Captioner] 19:04:54
SEVERELY IMPAIR PUBLIC HEALTH
AND SAFETY.
FOLLOWING THE COUNCIL'S VOTE


[Captioner] 19:04:57
DETERMINING THAT THIS
NON-AGENDIZED ITEM CONCERNS AN


[Captioner] 19:05:00
EMERGENCY SITUATION, THE COUNCIL
MAY THEN DELIBERATE ON THE


[Captioner] 19:05:04
RECOMMENDATION IN THE STAFF
REPORT.


[Captioner] 19:05:07
STAFF RECOMMENDS THAT THE CITY
COUNCIL ADOPT A RESOLUTION
RATIFYING THE


[Captioner] 19:05:10
EMERGENCY PROCLAMATION ISSUED BY
THE CITY MANAGER SERVING AS THE
CITY'S DIRECTOR OF


[Captioner] 19:05:16
EMERGENCY SERVICES.
THAT PROCLAMATION WAS ISSUED
YESTERDAY, AND STATE LAW


[Captioner] 19:05:19
REQUIRES THE COUNCIL TO RATIFY
THAT EMERGENCY

[Captioner] 19:05:22
 WITHIN
PROCLAMATION WITHIN 7 DAYS.
THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE

[Captioner] 19:05:25
 THIS
EVENING.
AS THE COUNCIL WILL OBSERVE, THE

[Captioner] 19:05:27

CITY MANAGER HAS PROCLAIMED
THE EXISTENCE OF A LOCAL


[Captioner] 19:05:31
EMERGENCY THROUGHOUT THE CITY OF
FREMONT DUE TO RECENT AND
ANTICIPATED WEATHER EVENTS.

[Captioner] 19:05:35

IF THE COUNCIL DOES SO RATIFY
THIS EVENING THE

[Captioner] 19:05:38
 EMERGENCY WILL
CONTINUE UNTIL THE COUNCIL
TERMINATES THE EMERGENCY AT A


[Captioner] 19:05:41
LATER DATE.
AND WITH THAT, I'LL TURN IT OVER
TO THE MAYOR AND

[Captioner] 19:05:44
 COUNCIL.
>> Mayor Mei: SURE.
SO DO I NEED

[Captioner] 19:05:48
 TO ASK FOR AN
ACTION TO FIRST RATIFY THIS
BEFORE WE PROCEED WITH THE


[Captioner] 19:05:51
CONSENT CALENDAR?
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: FIRST,
TO

[Captioner] 19:05:54
 BE PERFECTLY CLEAR, THE FIRST
ACTION WILL BE JUST FOR THE
COUNCIL

[Captioner] 19:05:58
 TO DETERMINE THAT AN
EMERGENCY SITUATION EXISTS THIS


[Captioner] 19:06:01
EVENING, AND TO DO SO BY MOTION.
ONCE YOU MAKE THAT

[Captioner] 19:06:04
 FINDING, THEN
WE CAN MOVE FORWARD TO THE STAFF
REPORT AND

[Captioner] 19:06:07
 RESOLUTION.
>> Mayor Mei: I'LL MAKE THAT
MOTION THAT AN EMERGENCY


[Captioner] 19:06:10
SITUATION EXISTS.
>>

[Captioner] 19:06:14
 I SECOND.
>> Mayor Mei: IF WE COULD GET A
VOTE?


[Captioner] 19:06:17
>> Ms. Gauthier: WE DO HAVE TWO
HANDS RAISED SO I NEED TO


[Captioner] 19:06:20
DETERMINE IF THEY'RE RAISING
THEIR HAND FOR THIS PARTICULAR
ITEM.


[Captioner] 19:06:23
>> Mayor Mei: SURE, OF COURSE.
>> Mayor Mei: JUST

[Captioner] 19:06:26
 TO LET THE
AUDIENCE KNOW, THIS IS OUR FIRST
TIME WE'RE MEETING IN

[Captioner] 19:06:29
 PERSON,
AND ALSO WITH A COMBINATION OF
STILL THE ZOOM,

[Captioner] 19:06:32
 SO I APOLOGIZE
THIS MAY BE A

[Captioner] 19:06:36
 LITTLE BIT
DIFFERENT THAN PAST PRACTICE, SO
IF THERE'S PEOPLE WHO WANT

[Captioner] 19:06:39
 TO
TURN IN A CARD, THEY MAY DO SO
TO THE CITY CLERK

[Captioner] 19:06:42
 ON THIS ITEM,
AND THEN ALSO JUST

[Captioner] 19:06:45
 IF
MS. GAUTHIER, YOU COULD BE SO
KIND, CLERK,

[Captioner] 19:06:48
 TO --
>> Ms. Gauthier: WE'LL FIND OUT
IF THESE TWO SPEAKERS INTEND TO


[Captioner] 19:06:52
SPEAK ON THE NON-AGENDIZED ITEM.


[Captioner] 19:07:00
JUNG-HO PAK, ARE YOU SPEAKING ON
THIS NON-A AGENDIZED ITEM FOR


[Captioner] 19:07:03
THE EMERGENCY?
>> NO, I'M NOT.
I'M SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF

[Captioner] 19:07:06
 THEBAYFIELD HARMONIC.
>> Ms. Gauthier: OKAY.


[Captioner] 19:07:09
WE'LL COME BACK.
MR. HINDS?
>>

[Captioner] 19:07:13
 YES, I'D LIKE TO SPEAK ON
THIS NON-AGENDIZED ITEM.


[Captioner] 19:07:16
>> Ms. Gauthier: I'M SORRY, SAY
AGAIN?
>> YES.


[Captioner] 19:07:23
>> Ms. Gauthier: OKAY, WE'LL
START THE TIMER FOR YOU.


[Captioner] 19:07:28
>> I DON'T SEE THE TIMER.
OKAY.


[Captioner] 19:07:33
FIRST, HELLO, EVERYONE.
HAPPY NEW YEAR.
I

[Captioner] 19:07:36
 AM THANKFUL THAT THE CITY
MANAGER WAS ABLE TO DECLARE

[Captioner] 19:07:39
 THIS
EMERGENCY AND BEGIN HANDLING
THESE ISSUES.


[Captioner] 19:07:43
I AM ALSO THANKFUL THAT IN HER
EMERGENCY DECLARATION, SHE

[Captioner] 19:07:46
 BUILT
IN AN AUTOMATIC END DATE.
YOU THINK THAT'S A GOOD

[Captioner] 19:07:49
 DESIGN.
I URGE THE COUNCIL, WHEN WE
RATIFY IT,

[Captioner] 19:07:53
 TO ALSO BUILD IN AN
END DATE RATHER THAN

[Captioner] 19:07:57
 LEAVING IT
OPEN-ENDED THE WAY IT'S WRITTEN
DOWN, SO

[Captioner] 19:08:00
 WE'RE GOING FOR AN OPT
IN RATHER THAN AN OPT OUT.
IF YOU GET

[Captioner] 19:08:04
 A 30 DAYS, 45 DAYS,
55, 60, WHATEVER MAKES SENSE

[Captioner] 19:08:08

NOW, IT EXPIRES AUTOMATICALLY AT
THE END OF THAT, BUT IF WE HAVE


[Captioner] 19:08:11
ANOTHER CHAIN OF BOMB CYCLONES
COMING, THE COUNCIL

[Captioner] 19:08:13
 COULD ALWAYS
ADD ANOTHER 30 DAYS TO IT AS
NEEDED.


[Captioner] 19:08:17
THE OTHER WAY AROUND, IF WE GO
FOR THE OPT OUT MODEL, WHICH IS


[Captioner] 19:08:20
HOW THIS IS CURRENTLY WRITTEN
WITH NO END DATE, THE COUNCIL


[Captioner] 19:08:23
PUTS ITSELF IN A POSITION WHERE
YOU HAVE TO MEET AT SOME

[Captioner] 19:08:26
 LATER
DATE AND SAY, WELL, IS
EVERYTHING OKAY IN THE WORLD

[Captioner] 19:08:28

NOW?
UM, THAT NEVER HAPPENS.


[Captioner] 19:08:31
THERE'S ALWAYS THINGS TO BE
CONCERNED ABOUT.
I THINK IT JUST EASIER

[Captioner] 19:08:35
 FOR THE
COUNCIL TO SET AN END DATE NOW


[Captioner] 19:08:37
AND EXTEND IT ON REQUEST.
THAT'S IT.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:08:46
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:08:51
ARE THERE ANY OTHER SPEAKERS ON
THIS?


[Captioner] 19:08:56
>> Ms. Gauthier: IRIS, ARE YOU
SPEAKING -- DID YOU RAISE YOUR
HAND TO

[Captioner] 19:08:59
 SPEAK ON THE


[Captioner] 19:09:00
NON-AGENDIZED ITEM?
>> YES.
SO CAN YOU HEAR ME?


[Captioner] 19:09:03
>> Ms. Gauthier: YES, WE'LL
START YOUR TIMER.
>> THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:09:07
SO GOOD EVENING, THE HONORABLE
CITY

[Captioner] 19:09:10
 COUNCILMEMBERS.
AND MY NAME IS IRIS,

[Captioner] 19:09:15
 AND I'M
SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF RESIDENTS
FOR

[Captioner] 19:09:18
 THE -- CROSSING COMMUNITY.
SO WHY WE FEEL

[Captioner] 19:09:21
 IT'S AN
EMERGENCY --
>> Mayor Mei: 

[Captioner] 19:09:25
APOLOGIES, I THINK
THAT IS FOR THIS NON-AGENDIZED
ITEM WHICH

[Captioner] 19:09:28
 IS ABOUT THE
EMERGENCY.


[Captioner] 19:09:32
NOT THE PUBLIC COMMENTS.
PUBLIC COMMUNICATIONS.


[Captioner] 19:09:35
SO MY APOLOGIES IF THERE'S
CONFUSION.


[Captioner] 19:09:40
>> SO THIS MEANS THAT I WILL
WAIT UNTIL

[Captioner] 19:09:43
 THE PUBLIC COMMENT
SECTION TO SPEAK

[Captioner] 19:09:45
 AGAIN?
>> Mayor Mei: THAT IS CORRECT,
MA'AM.


[Captioner] 19:09:48
>> OKAY.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:09:58
>> Mayor Mei: SO RIGHT NOW WE'RE
ASKING FOR SPEAKERS RELATED TO
THE LOCAL EMERGENCY, WHICH IS


[Captioner] 19:10:02
NON-AGENDIZED BECAUSE IT WAS AN
EMERGENCY THAT WAS CALLED BY

[Captioner] 19:10:06
 OUR
DIRECTOR OF EMERGENCY SERVICES,
WHICH IS ACTING IN

[Captioner] 19:10:10
 THIS CASE AS
OUR CITY MANAGER.


[Captioner] 19:10:15
ARE THERE OTHER SPEAKERS, MA'AM?
>> Ms. Gauthier: 

[Captioner] 19:10:17
NO, MADAME
MAYOR.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:10:18
I SEE ON THE COUNCIL,
COUNCILMEMBER COX AND
COUNCILMEMBER SHAO.


[Captioner] 19:10:23
>> Councilmember Shao: THAT WAS
FROM THE PREVIOUS ONE.
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY.


[Captioner] 19:10:28
AND THEN SEEING NONE, IF WE
COULD VOTE WITH

[Captioner] 19:10:31
 THE DAIS, THAT
WOULD BE TERRIFIC.
THANK

[Captioner] 19:10:35
 YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: IS THAT FROM
BEFORE

[Captioner] 19:10:39
 OR -- YES, BECAUSE I SEE
SOME PEOPLE -- AND ALSO


[Captioner] 19:10:41
COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL, ARE YOU
SPEAKING ON IT OR ARE YOU GOING
TO VOTE?


[Captioner] 19:10:44
OKAY.
COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL WAS
ACTUALLY FIRST.


[Captioner] 19:10:48
APOLOGIES.
>> Councilmember Campbell: 

[Captioner] 19:10:51
I
JUST WANTED TO -- I HEARD THE


[Captioner] 19:10:54
SPEAKER INDICATE THAT THERE WAS
NO END DATE TO THIS

[Captioner] 19:10:58
 RESOLUTION.
BUT I WAS LOOKING AT THE -- IT
IS FURTHER PROCLAIMED

[Captioner] 19:11:02
 THE LAST
STANZA HERE, AND IT DOES SAY


[Captioner] 19:11:06
"SHALL EXPIRE SEVEN DAYS AFTER
ISSUANCE."
DID WE MISS

[Captioner] 19:11:09
 SOMETHING IN TERMS
OF AN EXPIRATION DATE OF THIS?


[Captioner] 19:11:14
>> Mayor Mei: COULD OUR CITY
ATTORNEY PLEASE

[Captioner] 19:11:16
 CLARIFY?
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: I CAN
CLARIFY.


[Captioner] 19:11:20
I'LL RESPOND TO THAT QUESTION
DIRECTLY AND THEN I'M GOING TO
PIVOT TO

[Captioner] 19:11:24
 A PROCEDURAL
OBSERVATION.
THE

[Captioner] 19:11:27
 CITY MANAGER'S LOCAL
EMERGENCY

[Captioner] 19:11:31
 PROCLAMATION HAS A
SEVEN-DAY LIFE.
AND

[Captioner] 19:11:35
 THEN THE -- TO CONTINUE THAT
EMERGENCY, THE COUNCIL HAS TO
RATIFY

[Captioner] 19:11:38
 THAT ACTION.
SO THIS EVENING, WE'RE HERE
BECAUSE THIS IS

[Captioner] 19:11:41
 REALLY THE ONLY
OPPORTUNITY WE WILL HAVE WITHIN
A SEVEN-DAY PERIOD

[Captioner] 19:11:44
 FOR THE
COUNCIL TO TAKE ACTION TO RATIFY
THE

[Captioner] 19:11:47
 LOCAL EMERGENCY
PROCLAMATION.
THE

[Captioner] 19:11:50
 PROCEDURAL OBSERVATION I
WANT TO MAKE IS, THE COUNCIL HAS
NOT YET

[Captioner] 19:11:54
 ADDED THIS NON-AGENDA
ITEM FOR DISCUSSION UNTIL IT
VOTES ON

[Captioner] 19:11:57
 THE MOTION THAT AN
EMERGENCY SITUATION EXISTS, AND
THAT WILL YOU'RE

[Captioner] 19:12:00
 GOING TO
ACTUALLY CONSIDER THE ITEM.
SO MY RECOMMENDATION WOULD BE

[Captioner] 19:12:03
 TO
PROCEED ON YOUR VOTE REGARDING
WHETHER AN EMERGENCY SITUATION


[Captioner] 19:12:07
EXISTS AND YOU CAN HAVE A DEBATE
ON WHETHER AN

[Captioner] 19:12:09
 EMERGENCY
SITUATION EXISTS SO YOU CAN
CERTAINLY HAVE COMMENT ON THAT.


[Captioner] 19:12:12
BUT IN TERMS OF THE SUBSTANCE OF
THE PROCLAMATION, WE SHOULD WAIT


[Captioner] 19:12:16
UNTIL THE COUNCIL HAS DETERMINED
THAT AN EMERGENCY SITUATION
EXISTS

[Captioner] 19:12:19
 AND THAT WE'RE GOING TO
PROCEED ON THIS NON-AGENDIZED
ITEM.


[Captioner] 19:12:22
>> Mayor Mei: SO I THINK JUST TO
CLARIFY PER THE CITY

[Captioner] 19:12:25
 ATTORNEY'S
COMMENT, RIGHT NOW WE'RE JUST
AGREEING WHETHER OR NOT

[Captioner] 19:12:28
 THERE IS
A LOCAL EMERGENCY AT THIS TIME.


[Captioner] 19:12:32
SO IF YOU COULD PLEASE TAKE A
VOTE.


[Captioner] 19:12:42
THANK YOU.
SO THE MOTION PASSES
UNANIMOUSLY.


[Captioner] 19:12:45
AND THEN NOW WE'RE GOING TO HAVE
THE DISCUSSION DEBATE AS TO

[Captioner] 19:12:48
 THE
VERBIAGE AND

[Captioner] 19:12:51
 RATIFYING THE
PROCLAMATION AS IT STANDS AND
THE VERBIAGE.


[Captioner] 19:12:55
SO WE'LL RETURN TO COUNCILMEMBER
CAMPBELL.


[Captioner] 19:12:58
>> Councilmember Campbell: I'M
SORRY, I GOT MY QUESTION
ANSWERED.


[Captioner] 19:12:59
THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:13:03
COUNCILMEMBER

[Captioner] 19:13:05
 KENG?
>> Vice Mayor Keng: THANK YOU,
MADAME MAYOR.


[Captioner] 19:13:09
SO MY QUESTION WAS ALSO -- MY
QUESTION WAS ALSO

[Captioner] 19:13:12
 ON THE
EXPIRATION DATE OF THE
PROCLAMATION, SO

[Captioner] 19:13:16
 IT WILL BE
7 DAYS UNLESS

[Captioner] 19:13:19
 WE --
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: THE
RESOLUTION THAT YOU WOULD BE


[Captioner] 19:13:23
ADOPTING RATIFYING THE
PROCLAMATION WOULD ACTUALLY NOT
HAVE AN END

[Captioner] 19:13:26
 DATE.
THE WAY THAT IT'S WRITTEN RIGHT
NOW IS

[Captioner] 19:13:29
 THAT THE EMERGENCY WOULD
CONTINUE UNTIL

[Captioner] 19:13:33
 THE COUNCIL COMES
BACK, TAKES FURTHER ACTION TO
TERMINATE

[Captioner] 19:13:36
 THE LOCAL EMERGENCY
PROCLAMATION, SO IT DOES NOT
HAVE AN END DATE.


[Captioner] 19:13:39
NOW, STATE LAW REQUIRES US TO
REPORT BACK WITHIN

[Captioner] 19:13:42
 A 60-DAY
PERIOD IRRESPECTIVE OF WHETHER


[Captioner] 19:13:46
THIS RESOLUTION HAS AN END DATE
AND CERTAINLY IT IS ACCEPTABLE


[Captioner] 19:13:49
FOR THE COUNCIL TO DETERMINE TO
INCLUDE AN END

[Captioner] 19:13:52
 DATE, ALTHOUGH
THAT, OF COURSE, HAS SOME
CONSEQUENCES.


[Captioner] 19:13:55
I MEAN, IT COULD LIMIT YOUR
ABILITY TO RESPOND TO
EMERGENCIES OR YOU MAY

[Captioner] 19:13:58
 HAVE TO
COME BACK SOONER, SO THAT'S
SOMETHING THAT YOU'LL HAVE TO


[Captioner] 19:14:01
CONSIDER AS YOU'RE DETERMINING
WHETHER YOU'D LIKE TO INCLUDE A
SPECIFIC DATE FOR

[Captioner] 19:14:05
 TERMINATION AT
THIS

[Captioner] 19:14:07
 TIME.
>> Vice Mayor Keng: GREAT.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:14:17
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY.
SO IS THERE ANY INTEREST IN
MODIFYING OR IS THERE A MOTION


[Captioner] 19:14:20
TO ACCEPT IT AS IT STANDS?
IN TERMS OF

[Captioner] 19:14:23
 THE RESOLUTION.


[Captioner] 19:14:27
>> Councilmember Cox: MOTION TO
ACCEPT IT AS IS.
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY.


[Captioner] 19:14:29
WE HAVE A MOTION.
>> Councilmember Campbell: I'LL
SECOND.


[Captioner] 19:14:32
>> Mayor Mei: AND WE HAVE A
SECOND.
SO IF YOU COULD PLEASE

[Captioner] 19:14:40
 VOTE.
THE

[Captioner] 19:14:43
 MOTION CARRIES UNANIMOUSLY.
THANK YOU.
IT'S APPROVED.


[Captioner] 19:14:48
AT THIS TIME IS THE CONSENT
CALENDAR, AND THE CONSENT
CALENDAR ITEMS ARE THOSE THAT


[Captioner] 19:14:52
ARE LISTED AND THE ITEMS WILL BE
PASSED WITH ONE

[Captioner] 19:14:55
 COUNCIL VOTE,
WITH THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION


[Captioner] 19:14:59

PUBLIC MAY WANT TO COMMENT ON
THIS ITEM, IF THEY

[Captioner] 19:15:02
 WANT TO DO SO
OR PULL AN ITEM ON THE CONSENT


[Captioner] 19:15:06

 IN-PERSON
ATTENDEES, NOR DO WE HAVE ANY
HANDS RAISED ON ZOOM.


[Captioner] 19:15:26

MANY YEARS OF CONTINUING THIS

ALSO OF YOUR

[Captioner] 19:20:04
 SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM
AND RECIPIENTS.
>> THANK

[Captioner] 19:20:07
 YOU.
>> THANK YOU.
>> Councilmember Cox: MAYOR MEI,


[Captioner] 19:20:10
I WOULD LIKE TO ADD A FEW
POINTS?
>> Mayor Mei: UM,

[Captioner] 19:20:14
 OKAY.
>> Councilmember Cox: THANK YOU.
IT IS TRULY AN

[Captioner] 19:20:17
 HONOR TO BE A
LIFE IT IS TIME MEMBER OF THE
AFRO-AMERICAN

[Captioner] 19:20:20
 CULTURAL AND
HISTORICAL SOCIETY, AND ALSO

[Captioner] 19:20:24
 TO
THANK JEANNE FRICKLAND AND HER


[Captioner] 19:20:28
BELOVED HUSBAND

[Captioner] 19:20:33
 HERMAN, THAT
THEY FOUNDED THIS ORGANIZATION


[Captioner] 19:20:36
IN THEIR HOME AS WELL AS TO
SANDRA SMITH.
THE SOCIETY, JUST

[Captioner] 19:20:39
 TO ADD A
COUPLE OF POINTS HERE, THE
SOCIETY HAS BEEN

[Captioner] 19:20:44
 CELEBRATING 10
YEARS AHEAD OF WHEN

[Captioner] 19:20:47
 CONGRESS HAD
OFFICIALLY

[Captioner] 19:20:50
 OBSERVED THE FEDERAL
HOLIDAY INN OBSERVANCE

[Captioner] 19:20:53
 OF MARTIN
LUTHER KING.
SO 46 YEARS AND YOU TAKE BACK 10


[Captioner] 19:20:56
YEARS, THE GOVERNMENT HAS ONLY
BEEN CELEBRATING IT 36 YEARS.
SO

[Captioner] 19:21:00
 I WANT

[Captioner] 19:21:04
 TO CONGRATULATE THE
SOCIETY FOR THINKING FORWARD AND
MOVING WITH THE INITIATIVE

[Captioner] 19:21:07
 OF
DR. KING.
WHEN I WORKED AT THE WHITE


[Captioner] 19:21:10
HOUSE, I HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF
WORKING WITH CORETTA

[Captioner] 19:21:13
 SCOTT KING
AND HER FAMILY, WITH MARTY AND
DEXTER

[Captioner] 19:21:16
 AND BERNICE, AND CARRYING
OUT DR. KING'S

[Captioner] 19:21:20
 MESSAGE
THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES,
NOT ONLY IN

[Captioner] 19:21:24
 WASHINGTON, D.C.,
AND NOT ONLY IN ATLANTA, BUT IT
WAS

[Captioner] 19:21:26
 TRULY AN HONOR TO SERVE ON
THE MARTIN LUTHER KING
COMMISSION.


[Captioner] 19:21:30
AND I JUST WANTED TO JUST ADD
THAT THE

[Captioner] 19:21:33
 FREMONT DOWNTOWN CENTER
DOES BEAR THE NAME

[Captioner] 19:21:36
 AS OF
NOVEMBER 16TH OF 2021, WHEN CITY
COUNCIL

[Captioner] 19:21:40
 ADOPTED IT, WAS CORETTA
SCOTT KING'S FAMOUS

[Captioner] 19:21:43
 QUOTE, "THE
GREATNESS OF A COMMUNITY IS MOST
ACCURATELY

[Captioner] 19:21:47
 MEASURED BY THE
COMPASSIONATE ACTIONS OF ITS


[Captioner] 19:21:54
MEMBERS AND SERVING IN A HEART
OF GRACE AND LOVE AND SOUL."


[Captioner] 19:21:57
AND SO THAT IS IMPORTANT TO BE
ABLE TO MAKE SURE THAT IS


[Captioner] 19:22:01
CLEARLY STATED THROUGHOUT OUR
FREMONT HISTORY, BECAUSE IT IS
ON OUR WALL FOREVER.


[Captioner] 19:22:07
AND ALSO THAT THERE'S ANOTHER
SPECIAL CONNECTION, IS THAT MY


[Captioner] 19:22:10
FAMILY ESTABLISHED THE
DR. MARTIN LUTHER

[Captioner] 19:22:14
 MARTIN LUTHER KING/CORETTA


[Captioner] 19:22:17
SCOTT KING BOOK AWARDS THAT WAS
IN CONJUNCTION WITH

[Captioner] 19:22:20
 THE LIBRARY
ASSOCIATION, AND ALSO TO MENTION
THAT THE SOCIETY SELECTED A


[Captioner] 19:22:24
YOUNG LADY IN HIGH SCHOOL, AND
LATER ON,

[Captioner] 19:22:27
 SHE WOULD BECOME OUR
CITY MANAGER, NO OTHER THAN
KARENA

[Captioner] 19:22:31
 SHACKELFORD, THAT THEY
GAVE A SCHOLARSHIP TO HER TO
HELP

[Captioner] 19:22:34
 HER FURTHER EDUCATION AND
SHE'S GIVING IT BACK

[Captioner] 19:22:37
 TO US IN
PUBLIC SERVICE, SERVING AS OUR
CITY

[Captioner] 19:22:40
 MANAGER, AND I THINK THOSE
ARE THE THINGS THAT ARE SO
WORTHWHILE

[Captioner] 19:22:44
 THAT THE SOCIETY
EVERY YEAR GIVES ANNUAL COLLEGE


[Captioner] 19:22:47
SCHOLARSHIPS TO HELP STUDENTS


[Captioner] 19:22:50
FIND THEIR -- PURSUE THEIR
EDUCATION AND GIVE BACK TO OUR
COMMUNITY.


[Captioner] 19:22:54
AND AS WE LOOK FORWARD TO
CELEBRATING

[Captioner] 19:22:58
 DR. MARTIN LUTHER
KING NOT ONLY ON JANUARY THE
16TH, MONDAY,

[Captioner] 19:23:02
 BUT ALSO FOLLOWING
HIS PRINCIPLES THROUGHOUT THE
YEAR, THAT

[Captioner] 19:23:05
 ALL OF US CAN ADVANCE
EQUITY,

[Captioner] 19:23:09
 RESPECT, SOCIAL JUSTICE,
OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL,

[Captioner] 19:23:12
 AND MAKE
SURE THAT ALL OF US CHALLENGE
EACH OTHER

[Captioner] 19:23:15
 TO PARTICIPATE IN THE
NEVER-ENDING WORK OF

[Captioner] 19:23:17
 BUILDING A
MORE PERFECT UNION IN OUR
COMMUNITY.


[Captioner] 19:23:21
THANK YOU SO MUCH.


[Captioner] 19:23:25
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
WE CERTAINLY ARE VERY PROUD OF
THE

[Captioner] 19:23:29
 CONTRIBUTIONS AND

[Captioner] 19:23:32
 THE
SUCCESS IN REPRESENTATION FOR
MANY OF THE SCHOLARSHIP


[Captioner] 19:23:36
RECIPIENTS.
IN FACT, THIS SUMMER, WE ALSO
HAD THE OPPORTUNITY

[Captioner] 19:23:39
 TO RECOGNIZE
SOME OF THE -- THIS YEAR'S
RECIPIENTS BY

[Captioner] 19:23:43
 OUR DOWNTOWN EVENT
CENTER IN A SMALLER

[Captioner] 19:23:46
 CEREMONY,
BUT I THINK THAT THIS IS A
CONTINUATION OF THE LONG

[Captioner] 19:23:49
 LEGACY,
AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO
CONTINUING THAT PARTNERSHIP.


[Captioner] 19:23:53
AT THIS TIME, I'D LIKE TO TURN
TO

[Captioner] 19:23:56
 ORAL COMMUNICATIONS, SO IT'S
ANY PERSON DESIRING TO SPEAK ON
A

[Captioner] 19:24:00
 MATTER WHICH IS NOT SCHEDULED
ON THIS AGENDA

[Captioner] 19:24:02
 MAY DO SO, AND I
BELIEVE THERE WAS A SPEAKER
EARLIER, IRIS.


[Captioner] 19:24:05
>> Ms. Gauthier: WE ACTUALLY
HAVE

[Captioner] 19:24:09
 SPEAKER CARDS SO I HAVE A
COMBINATION OF BOTH, SO I'LL
CALL THEM IN THE ORDER

[Captioner] 19:24:11
 THAT I
RECEIVED THEM, IF I MAY.
>> Mayor Mei: THAT WOULD BE


[Captioner] 19:24:15
WONDERFUL.
SO I WANTED TO AGAIN NOTE THAT
COMMUNICATIONS RECEIVED

[Captioner] 19:24:18
 VIA
EMAIL ARE PLACED ON FILE AND
CONSIDERED PART OF THE

[Captioner] 19:24:19
 PUBLIC
RECORD.
SO WE'LL TURN THIS OVER TO OUR


[Captioner] 19:24:23
CITY CLERK TO BE ABLE TO START
AND INTRODUCE EACH

[Captioner] 19:24:27
 SPEAKER.
>> Ms. Gauthier: THE FIRST
PERSON IS BRITTANY

[Captioner] 19:24:31
 TOLNER.
SHE'S IN THE AUDIENCE TO COME UP
TO THE PODIUM, PLEASE.


[Captioner] 19:24:35
THE SPEAKER WILL START.
IF YOU CAN COME UP TO

[Captioner] 19:24:38
 THE
LECTERN, THE PODIUM HERE.
YES, PLEASE.


[Captioner] 19:24:45
>> Mayor Mei: WELL

[Captioner] 19:24:51
WELCOME.
>> HI.


[Captioner] 19:24:56
I'M BRITTANY TOLNER.
HELLO.


[Captioner] 19:24:59
IT'S MY FIRST MEETING SO I DON'T


[Captioner] 19:25:02
REALLY HAVE A SPECIFIC, I GUESS,
SUBJECT TO

[Captioner] 19:25:08
 SPEAK ABOUT.
WELL, ONE IS THE

[Captioner] 19:25:12
 HOMELESS ISSUE
THAT IS

[Captioner] 19:25:16
 HAPPENING IN THE CITY.
THERE ARE BUILDINGS THAT ARE


[Captioner] 19:25:19
BEING

[Captioner] 19:25:23
 OCCUPIED BY HOMELESS, AND
THERE'S

[Captioner] 19:25:27
 NO POWER, THERE'S NO
RUNNING

[Captioner] 19:25:31
 WATER, AND I GUESS I'LL
STOP THERE.
WANT

[Captioner] 19:25:34
 TO LET YOU GUYS

[Captioner] 19:25:38
 GIVE ME
SOME FEEDBACK OR WHAT YOU THINK
ABOUT THAT OR WHAT I

[Captioner] 19:25:41
 SHOULD DO.


[Captioner] 19:25:51
>> Mayor Mei: I APOLOGIZE, I
JUST WANT TO CLARIFY, FOR PUBLIC


[Captioner] 19:25:54
COMMUNICATIONS, BECAUSE IT'S NOT
AGENDIZED, WE CANNOT COMMENT ON
THE

[Captioner] 19:25:57
 ITEMS, BUT YOU'RE WELCOME TO
SHARE YOUR FEEDBACK TO US.


[Captioner] 19:26:00
>> OH, SO YOU CAN'T --
>> Mayor Mei: IT'S NOT

[Captioner] 19:26:03
 A
CONVERSATION, NO, MA'AM.
>> OH, IT'S NOT A CONVERSATION,


[Captioner] 19:26:06
SO WHEN DO I GET

[Captioner] 19:26:10
 FEEDBACK OR A
COMMENT BACK FROM YOU?
>> Mayor Mei: WELL, REGARDING


[Captioner] 19:26:13
HOMELESSNESS, WE DO HAVE A
DEDICATED PAGE ON OUR

[Captioner] 19:26:16
 WEBSITE
AND ALSO WE ALSO HAVE OUR
FREMONT FAMILY RESOURCE

[Captioner] 19:26:19
 CENTER,
AND WE'D BE HAPPY TO CONNECT YOU
TO SOME OF THE PEOPLE THAT ARE


[Captioner] 19:26:22
THERE.
>> I MEAN, OKAY, I KNOW -- I
KNOW

[Captioner] 19:26:25
 WHAT RESOURCES THERE ARE,
I'M JUST SAYING THAT THEY'RE NOT


[Captioner] 19:26:30
OBVIOUSLY -- OR THEY'RE NOT --
THAT'S ALL I'M

[Captioner] 19:26:33
 SAYING.
SO I

[Captioner] 19:26:36
 GUESS I'LL SIT BACK DOWN
NOW.


[Captioner] 19:26:41
>> Ms. Gauthier: MAYOR MEI, CAN
I --
>> Mayor Mei: SURE.


[Captioner] 19:26:44
I KNOW BAY AREA COMMUNITY
SERVICES -- BUT WE CAN'T REALLY


[Captioner] 19:26:46
TALK ABOUT --
>> Councilmember Campbell: I'M
NOT ASKING THAT.


[Captioner] 19:26:50
IF I CAN JUST ASK A QUICK
QUESTION.
CAN WE JUST TAKE

[Captioner] 19:26:52
 HER INFORMATION
AND HAVE SOMEONE --
>> Mayor Mei: SURE.


[Captioner] 19:26:56
THAT'S WHAT I ACTUALLY WAS GOING
TO RECOMMEND NEXT, IS THAT

[Captioner] 19:26:58
 STAFF
TAKES THAT INFORMATION.
WE DO HAVE MEMBERS OF OUR STAFF


[Captioner] 19:27:01
IN THE AUDIENCE, AND I THINK
THAT THEY WILL BE HAPPY TO TAKE
DOWN THAT.


[Captioner] 19:27:04
BUT I APPRECIATE THE SUGGESTION.


[Captioner] 19:27:12
>> Ms. Gauthier: THE NEXT
SPEAKER IS ON ZOOM.


[Captioner] 19:27:17
JUNG HO PAK.
>> THANK YOU VERY

[Captioner] 19:27:21
 MUCH.
MADAME MAYOR AND CITY
COUNCILMEMBERS AND CITY STAFF


[Captioner] 19:27:24
MEMBERS AS WELL.
I

[Captioner] 19:27:28
 AM ARTISTIC DIRECTOR AND
CONDUCTOR OF THE

[Captioner] 19:27:30
 BAYFIELD
HARMONIC.
FOR SEVERAL DECADES, YOU MAY


[Captioner] 19:27:33
KNOW THAT WE'VE BEEN KNOWN AS
THE FREMONT SYMPHONY, BUT AS OF


[Captioner] 19:27:36
THIS PAST OCTOBER, AND AFTER A
YEAR OF SILENCE DUE TO COVID, WE


[Captioner] 19:27:39
HAVE NOW RETURNED TO THE CONCERT
STAGE, AND WE ARE NOW KNOWN

[Captioner] 19:27:43
 AS
THE BAY PHILHARMONIC.
BUT

[Captioner] 19:27:46
 WE REMAIN DEDICATED TO
SERVING THE CITY OF

[Captioner] 19:27:49
 FREMONT AS
WELL AS THE TRI-CITY AREA, WITH
WORLD

[Captioner] 19:27:52
 CLASS ENTERTAINMENT.
WE ARE AWARE THAT

[Captioner] 19:27:55
 FREMONT IS AN
EXTREMELY DIVERSE COMMUNITY IN
TERMS OF

[Captioner] 19:27:58
 ETHNICITY, RACE,
RELIGION, EDUCATION, AND
ECONOMIC

[Captioner] 19:28:02
 BACKGROUND.
WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO HAVE NEVER
SEEN AN

[Captioner] 19:28:07
 ORCHESTRA BEFORE SEE OUR
SHOWS, OPERA OR BALLET, AS WELL
AS THOSE IN THE

[Captioner] 19:28:10
 COMMUNITY WHO
ARE VERY SOPHISTICATED IN TERMS
OF THEIR TASTES

[Captioner] 19:28:13
 AND EXPERIENCES
IN FINE ARTS AND THE PERFORMING


[Captioner] 19:28:16
ARTS.
I'M PART OF THE

[Captioner] 19:28:20
 BAY PHILHARMONIC
AS ITS LEADERSHIP BECAUSE I LOVE
THE

[Captioner] 19:28:23
 PLURALITY OF FREMONT AND THE
TRI-CITY.
I'VE GOTTEN TO

[Captioner] 19:28:26
 KNOW THE LEADERS,
THE RESIDENTS AND THE STUDENTS
OF THE FREMONT COMMUNITY, AND I


[Captioner] 19:28:29
BELIEVE THAT THIS IS ONE OF THE
MOST EXCITING AREAS IN THE


[Captioner] 19:28:33
ENTIRE BAY AREA.
AND I'VE LIVED ACROSS THE
COUNTRY IN OTHER PARTS OF

[Captioner] 19:28:37
 THE
WORLD.
THERE'S SO MANY RESOURCES IN THE


[Captioner] 19:28:40
CITY OF FREMONT, CULTURALLY AND
EDUCATIONALLY.
JUST FOR

[Captioner] 19:28:43
 SOME CONTEXT, I'M
FORMER MUSIC DIRECTOR OF

[Captioner] 19:28:46
 THE
SAN DIEGO SYMPHONY, THE CAPE
SYMPHONY IN

[Captioner] 19:28:49
 HYANNIS ON CAPE COD,
THE NEW HAVEN SYMPHONY, AND I'VE
BEEN ON

[Captioner] 19:28:52
 FACULTY OF MANY
NATIONALLY RENOWNED

[Captioner] 19:28:56
 MUSIC
INSTITUTIONS LIKE UNIVERSITY OF
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,


[Captioner] 19:29:00
SAN FRANCISCO CONSERVATORY AND
U.C. BERKELEY, AND I CAN'T WAIT
TO

[Captioner] 19:29:03
 BRING THAT EXPERIENCE TO
FREMONT AND SHARE IT WITH
EVERYONE.


[Captioner] 19:29:07
JUST TO LET YOU

[Captioner] 19:29:10
 KNOW, WE BELIEVE
WE ARE CREATING AN EXPERIENCE
FOR THE PERSON WHO'S ATTENDING

[Captioner] 19:29:14
 A
SYMPHONY FOR THE VERY FIRST
TIME, WHICH MAY

[Captioner] 19:29:18
 POSSIBLY INCLUDE
YOURSELVES, THAT

[Captioner] 19:29:21
 THE PERSON --
THE AVERAGE CITIZEN DESERVES THE
BEAUTY AND JOY IN

[Captioner] 19:29:24
 THEIR LIVES.
AND SO WE WANT THE PERSON WHO
ATTENDS THE FIRST

[Captioner] 19:29:28
 TIME TO JUST
FALL IN LOVE WITH US, WITHOUT
HAVING TO HAVE A PROGRAM NOTE

[Captioner] 19:29:31
 OR
BACKGROUND.
WE THINK THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE


[Captioner] 19:29:34
WHO ALREADY HAVE THAT EXPERIENCE
BUT DON'T WANT TO DRIVE TO


[Captioner] 19:29:37
SAN FRANCISCO OR SAN JOSÉ
THROUGH TRAFFIC

[Captioner] 19:29:40
 OR THE EXPENSE
AND TIME.
WE BELIEVE WE CAN BRING WORLD


[Captioner] 19:29:44
CLASS ENTERTAINMENT TO FREMONT
RIGHT NOW, AND WE ARE DOING

[Captioner] 19:29:47

THAT.
SO OUR GOALS

[Captioner] 19:29:50
 ARE VERY AMBITIOUS.
WE WANT TO REFLECT OUR
COMMUNITY, WHICH INCLUDES THE


[Captioner] 19:29:53
AFRICAN AMERICAN, ASIAN

[Captioner] 19:31:08

GROWING AND BUILDING AND IS A
WONDERFUL PLACE TO LIVE AND

OF THAT AND BE PART OF THE
AGENDA FOR THE CITY

[Captioner] 19:31:19
 FOR
INCREASING THE QUALITY OF LIFE

ON BHAFT OF THE

[Captioner] 19:32:52

THE -- CROSSING COMMUNITY.
JUST AS

 THE SPEAKERS SAID, WE
REALLY ENJOY

[Captioner] 19:32:58
 LIVING IN THE CITY
OF FREMONT, OUR COMMUNITY.


[Captioner] 19:33:04
BUT STARTING LIKE AROUND


[Captioner] 19:33:08
SEPTEMBER, WE LIST CONCERNS OF
INCREASING CRIME RISK IN OUR
NEIGHBORHOOD, AND

[Captioner] 19:33:12
 I ALREADY
SHARE SOME INFORMATION INCLUDING
PICTURES AND

[Captioner] 19:33:17
 VIDEOS AND WITH THE
CITY COUNCIL TEAM.


[Captioner] 19:33:21
UNFORTUNATELY IT'S GETTING EVEN
WORSE DURING THE HOLIDAYS.
WE HAVE ANOTHER

[Captioner] 19:33:25
 FEW CASES OF
INTRUDERS FROM THE

[Captioner] 19:33:29
 RESEARCH
AVENUE BREAK IN OUR BUILDINGS AT
3:00 A.M. AND

[Captioner] 19:33:33
 MIDNIGHT, JUMPING
OVER WALLS TO USE OUR

[Captioner] 19:33:36
 CLUBHOUSE,
AND URINATING IN THE COMMUNITY
PROPERTY WITH KIDS AROUND.


[Captioner] 19:33:39
SO LAST WEEK WELL HAVE --

[Captioner] 19:33:43
 THE
PEOPLE FROM THE RESEARCH AVENUE
ALSO

[Captioner] 19:33:47
 CAME TO -- AFTER BREAKING
THE DOORS.


[Captioner] 19:33:50
SO WE ARE LIVING WITH FEAR EVERY
DAY.


[Captioner] 19:33:53
IF YOU ASK OUR TRUE FEELING NOW.
SO WE

[Captioner] 19:33:57
 URGE THE CITY COUNCIL TO
TAKE CORRECTIVE

[Captioner] 19:34:02
 ACTIONS AND --
OUR PEOPLE IN THIS COMMUNITY
RIGHT NOW,

[Captioner] 19:34:07
 WE FEEL WE WANT TO


[Captioner] 19:34:12
GET -- AT THE INTERSECTION OF
RESEARCH AVENUE AND -- TO
PROTECT

[Captioner] 19:34:14
 THE PEOPLE LIVING IN
THIS NEIGHBORHOOD.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:34:23

GENTLEMEN.


[Captioner] 19:34:35

[Captioner] 19:34:38
I HAVE A DREAM.
I HAVE A DREAM.


[Captioner] 19:34:44
AND WE MAKE FREMONT FREE

[Captioner] 19:34:49
 FROM
ALL OF THE ISSUES THAT ARE
CONCERNING

[Captioner] 19:34:53
 US.
THAT THIS

[Captioner] 19:34:57
 HALL IS -- ON


[Captioner] 19:35:01
EVERYBODY'S FACE, WE ARE HERE TO
CELEBRATE

[Captioner] 19:35:04
 DR. MARTIN LUTHER
KING'S BIRTHDAY ON MONDAY.


[Captioner] 19:35:08
LET US CELEBRATE IT FROM NOW,
THIS

[Captioner] 19:35:13
 MOMENT.
THERE ARE A FEW THINGS THAT ARE
REALLY, REALLY

[Captioner] 19:35:16
 IMPORTANT AND
VERY CONCERNING.


[Captioner] 19:35:20
NUMBER ONE, I'M LOOKING

[Captioner] 19:35:23
 TO THE
POLICE DEPARTMENT TO BUY BACK
ILLEGAL

[Captioner] 19:35:27
 GUNS ON THE STREET,


[Captioner] 19:35:30
$35,000, SO FAR I COLLECTED
$17,000

[Captioner] 19:35:36
 AND -- ALL ILLEGAL GUNS
ARE PURCHASED OFF THE STREETS OF


[Captioner] 19:35:39
FREMONT.
AND IF

[Captioner] 19:35:42
 EVERYBODY WOULD -- LIKE
TO JOIN, ON

[Captioner] 19:35:46
 THE 31ST OF JANUARY.
THE SECOND THING IS THAT MANY
BILLS HAVE PASSED IN

[Captioner] 19:35:49
 THE STATE
OF CALIFORNIA

[Captioner] 19:35:53
 REGARDING -- MOST
COMMON ISSUES AGAIN AND

[Captioner] 19:35:55
 AGAIN
ARE HOUSING HOMELESS.
CRIME.


[Captioner] 19:36:01
PROBLEMS.
LET US GET THESE

[Captioner] 19:36:05
 GUNS OFF --
$7,000 -- IF EVERYBODY CAN

[Captioner] 19:36:08
 GET
INVOLVED,

[Captioner] 19:36:12
 $25,000, AND GET THE
GUNS BACK AND THAT

[Captioner] 19:36:15
 IS ON JANUARY 31ST.


[Captioner] 19:36:23
I HAVE THE FOUNDATION THAT WE
HAVE SERVED 35,000 HOT MEALS

[Captioner] 19:36:26
 TO
THE HOMELESS PEOPLE OF

[Captioner] 19:36:30
 FREMONT.


[Captioner] 19:36:34
144,000 -- IN FREMONT.
THE BILLS THAT HAVE PASSED IN


[Captioner] 19:36:37
THE STATE

[Captioner] 19:36:41
 ASSEMBLY -- IN THE
CITY

[Captioner] 19:36:44
 OF FREMONT -- POSSIBLE SO
THAT THIS CRISIS ON HOUSING

[Captioner] 19:36:49
 CAN
BE -- BILLS LIKE

[Captioner] 19:36:53
 CEQA AND ADUs
AND ALL OF THAT.
THE

[Captioner] 19:36:56
 CITY STAFF, THE

[Captioner] 19:36:58
 PLANNING
DEPARTMENT, HELP THEM GET MORE
PEOPLE.


[Captioner] 19:37:02
GIVE THEM MORE FUNDS.


[Captioner] 19:37:05
ALLOW PEOPLE -- SEVEN DAYS --
GET

[Captioner] 19:37:09
 INVOLVED.
IT IS NOT JUST A LIP SERVICE
THAT IS

[Captioner] 19:37:12
 NEEDED, IT IS ACTUALLY
GOING

[Captioner] 19:37:16
 OUT IN THE RAIN AND SEEING
HOW THOSE HOMELESS PEOPLE ARE,
THIS

[Captioner] 19:37:22
 LADY CAME FOR A BATHROOM
AND SHOWER.
ALL OF THESE THINGS

[Captioner] 19:37:24
 ARE
IMPORTANT.
PLEASE, ANYBODY WHO WOULD LIKE


[Captioner] 19:37:28
TO HELP, THEY CAN CALL ME, I
THINK EVERYBODY KNOWS

I'M SORRY, YOUR MIC IS NOT ON,
SIR.


[Captioner] 19:38:09
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:38:15
>> I'M HERE NOT JUST FOR ME

[Captioner] 19:38:18
 BUT
ALSO ON BEHALF OF MANY OTHER
CONCERNED RESIDENTS

[Captioner] 19:38:22
 OF FREMONT.
WE HAVE BEEN HAVING ACTIVE


[Captioner] 19:38:28
DISCUSSIONS ON THE NEXT DOOR
REGARDING THE CURRENT SITUATION
IN FREMONT RELATED

[Captioner] 19:38:31
 TO ALL THE
CONSTRUCTION GOING ON ON THE
ROADS,

[Captioner] 19:38:35
 AND HOW THE ROADS HAVE
BEEN

[Captioner] 19:38:38
 NARROWED RECENTLY, AND
MAKING

[Captioner] 19:38:41
 IT QUITE DANGEROUS FOR


[Captioner] 19:38:46
95% OF THE -- WE UNDERSTAND


[Captioner] 19:38:49
THERE'S A -- THE CITY TRIED TO
USE TO MAKE

[Captioner] 19:38:52
 BIKE LANES, BUT AT
THE SAME TIME, MANY OF THE ROADS
HAVE

[Captioner] 19:38:56
 BEEN NARROWED TO SUCH AN


[Captioner] 19:39:00
EXTENT

[Captioner] 19:39:04
 [INAUDIBLE] FOR MANY OF
US TO DRIVE ON THESE ROADS.
ADDED TO

[Captioner] 19:39:07
 THIS, THE -- AT
INTERSECTIONS BASICALLY IT'S
PREVENTING

[Captioner] 19:39:11
 THE TRAFFIC FROM
MAKING RIGHT TURNS AND AS A
RESULT OF

[Captioner] 19:39:15
 THIS, TRAFFIC IS
GETTING BACKED UP, ESPECIALLY
WITH ALL

[Captioner] 19:39:19
 THE -- WE HAVE GOING

[Captioner] 19:39:22

ON -- COMING UP, AND WE ARE VERY


[Captioner] 19:39:26
CONCERNED HOW THE CITY HAS DONE
THIS,

[Captioner] 19:39:30
 AND WITHOUT EVEN GETTING
ANY INPUT FROM THE

[Captioner] 19:39:33
 RESIDENTS,
AND I JUST WENT AROUND DIFFERENT


[Captioner] 19:39:36
CITIES IN ALAMEDA

[Captioner] 19:39:40
 COUNTY,
PLEASANTON, HAYWARD, I HAVE
NEVER SEEN ANY

[Captioner] 19:39:44
 OTHER CITY -- AND
MAKING THE ROADS -- AS

[Captioner] 19:39:47
 WE HAVE


[Captioner] 19:39:50
DONE.
OUR CITY HAS MUTILATED OUR
ROADS,

[Captioner] 19:39:53
 MADE IT VERY, VERY
DANGEROUS.


[Captioner] 19:39:57
AND IN FACT EVEN THE BIKE LANES
ARE SUCH THAT THEY ARE NOT


[Captioner] 19:40:00
UNIFORM.
FOR EXAMPLE, WASHINGTON AND --


[Captioner] 19:40:03
YOU HAVE EXPANDED THE ROADS AT
ONE SECTION

[Captioner] 19:40:06
 SO BROADLY, MADE THE
ROAD

[Captioner] 19:40:12
 NARROWS -- OVERPASS, THERE
IS NO BIKE LANE.
SO WE ARE GIVING A FALSE

[Captioner] 19:40:15
 SENSE
OF SECURITY TO THE BIKERS THAT
THEY HAVE

[Captioner] 19:40:19
 THESE BIKE LANES.
IN FACT, THEY'RE NOT UNIFORM.
IN MANY

[Captioner] 19:40:22
 CASES THAT IS THE CASE.
SO REALLY --

[Captioner] 19:40:25
 ARE WE MAKING IT
SAVER FOR THE BIKERS OR MAKING
IT HARDER

[Captioner] 19:40:29
 FOR THE -- WHICH IS
LIKE

[Captioner] 19:40:32
 99% FOOT TRAFFIC.
SO I CAME TO

[Captioner] 19:40:35
 THE CITY COUNCIL
BACK IN APRIL AND I GUESS THE
CITY CLERK

[Captioner] 19:40:42
 HAS MY COMPLAINT ON
THE WEBSITE FOR DISCUSSION

[Captioner] 19:40:45
 THIS
EVENING BY THE CITY COUNCIL.
I'M NOT SURE IF THE

[Captioner] 19:40:48
 DISCUSSION
HAS HAPPENED OR THERE IS
RESOLUTION, BULL

[Captioner] 19:40:51
 THIS IS NOT
ACCEPTABLE.
WHAT THE CITY

[Captioner] 19:40:54
 HAS DONE,
MUTILATING OUR ROADS, IS NOT
ACCEPTABLE.


[Captioner] 19:40:58
AND WE ARE VERY CONCERNED, WE
WANT YOU TO

[Captioner] 19:41:01
 ACTIVELY LOOK AT
THIS AND

[Captioner] 19:41:05
 REMOVE THE -- CHOPS
AND --

[Captioner] 19:41:08
 BIKE LANE

[Captioner] 19:41:11
 TRAFFIC --
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU, SIR.


[Captioner] 19:41:21
>> Ms. Gauthier: THE LAST
SPEAKER IS CIELE ON

[Captioner] 19:41:23
 ZOOM.
CL.
>> HI.


[Captioner] 19:41:27
HAPPY NEW YEAR AND GOOD EVENING,
HONORABLE CITY

[Captioner] 19:41:30
 COUNCILMEMBERS.
MY NAME

[Captioner] 19:41:33
 IS CLEMENT, RESIDENT OF
METROPOLITAN COMMUNITY.


[Captioner] 19:41:37
THE CRIME SITUATION HAS GOTTEN A
LOT WORSE

[Captioner] 19:41:41
 EXPONENTIALLY AND I'VE
SPOKEN

[Captioner] 19:41:43
 TO 10 FREMONT POLICE
OFFICERS IN PERSON SINCE
NOVEMBER 2022.


[Captioner] 19:41:48
WHERE ALMOST EVERY DAY, MORNING
AND THE NIGHT,

[Captioner] 19:41:51
 INTRUDERS ENTER
OUR FACILITIES TO

[Captioner] 19:41:55
 DEFECATE,
SHATTERING OUR BUILDING GLASS
DOORS,

[Captioner] 19:42:00
 BREAKING -- HIDING MIND
SOME OF THE BUILDINGS IN ATTEMPT


[Captioner] 19:42:03
TO INFILTRATE OUR BUILDINGS.
WHERE POLICE OFFICER

[Captioner] 19:42:07
 SHANDRA
ALSO WITNESSED IN PERSON.


[Captioner] 19:42:11
INTRUDERS HAVE ALSO

[Captioner] 19:42:15
 BROKEN IN TO
TAKE SHELTER.
THEY HAVE ALSO STOLEN CATALYTIC


[Captioner] 19:42:19
CONVERTERS INSIDE THE GARAGE AND
VANDALIZED THE CARS AROUND THE
NEIGHBORHOOD

[Captioner] 19:42:23
 JUST THIS PAST
WEEKEND.
SPEAKING OF

[Captioner] 19:42:26
 THAT, AT THIS VERY
MOMENT WE HAVE A BUILDING
REPORTING INTRUDERS THAT

[Captioner] 19:42:29
 HAVE
REFUSED TO LEAVE, OKAY, RIGHT
NOW, AND POLICE WERE CALLED AND


[Captioner] 19:42:33
THEN THEY JUST LEFT, ONLY WHEN
THE POLICE WERE CALLED,

[Captioner] 19:42:35
 BUT THEN
POLICE CANNOT CATCH THEM
ACCOUNTABLE.


[Captioner] 19:42:38
SO MY FAMILY AND THE RESIDENTS
ARE LIVING IN FEAR,

[Captioner] 19:42:41
 AND THERE'S
ALSO AN ONGOING INVESTIGATION OF


[Captioner] 19:42:45
MAIL THEFT BY FPD.
MANY OF THESE

[Captioner] 19:42:49
 INTRUDERS ESCAPED
TO THE RESEARCH AVENUE, WHERE
THE

[Captioner] 19:42:52
 RVs ARE ILLEGALLY PARKED
THERE.
WE REALLY URGE

[Captioner] 19:42:56
 YOU TO INSTALL A
GATE BETWEEN THE RESEARCH

[Captioner] 19:43:00
 AVENUE
AND -- STREET TO STOP SUSPECTS
USING THE

[Captioner] 19:43:03
 RESEARCH AVENUE AS AN
ESCAPE ROUTE.
FURTHERMORE, WE WOULD

[Captioner] 19:43:06
 ALSO NEED
MORE CITY-WIDE CAMERAS

[Captioner] 19:43:10
 IN
FREMONT TO HOLD ALL SUSPECTS
ACCOUNTABLE AS WELL AS

[Captioner] 19:43:13

INSTALLING THE BARRIER NEXT TO
THE SOUTH

[Captioner] 19:43:17
 GRIMMER BOULEVARD TO
PROTECT OUR COMMUNITY FROM

[Captioner] 19:43:19
 ANY
INTRUDERS.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.


[Captioner] 19:43:29
>> Ms. Gauthier: THAT'S THE LAST
SPEAKER.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:43:33
I WANTED TO THANK ALL THE PEOPLE
WHO HAVE BOTH

[Captioner] 19:43:36
 CALLED AND LEFT
THEIR FEEDBACK, AND I KNOW OUR
STAFF

[Captioner] 19:43:40
 AND OUR COUNCILMEMBERS
HAVE NOTED THIS.
AT

[Captioner] 19:43:43
 THIS TIME, I'D LIKE TO RETURN
TO OUR

[Captioner] 19:43:46
 REGULARLY SCHEDULED
ITEMS.
I WANTED TO AGAIN CLARIFY THAT


[Captioner] 19:43:49
FOR PUBLIC COMMUNICATIONS FOR
NON-AGENDA ITEMS,

[Captioner] 19:43:52
 WE WILL NOT BE
AS A COUNCIL RESPONDING, BUT THE


[Captioner] 19:43:55
STAFF HAS TAKEN THE INFORMATION
DOWN, AND THERE ARE ALSO


[Captioner] 19:43:59
DISCUSSIONS AND, IN FACT, IN
GENERAL I WOULD MENTION THAT AS
PLANS

[Captioner] 19:44:02
 COME UP, WHETHER IT'S ON
HOMELESSNESS OR

[Captioner] 19:44:06
 MOBILITY, SUCH
AS MOBILITY BIKE

[Captioner] 19:44:09
 PEDESTRIAN
PLANS, THOSE ARE ACTUALLY
AGENDIZED AND THOSE

[Captioner] 19:44:12
 WILL BE IN
DISCUSSIONS THAT YOU CAN COME
AND SHARE YOUR FEEDBACK

[Captioner] 19:44:15
 ALSO ON.
THIS EVENING OUR FIRST

[Captioner] 19:44:19
 SCHEDULED
REGULAR ITEM IS ITEM 5A.
WHICH IS

[Captioner] 19:44:26
 THE 2023 HOUSING
ELEMENT PLAN UPDATE.
I'D LIKE TO

[Captioner] 19:44:29
 WELCOME PRINCIPAL
PLANNER WAYLAND LI WHO WILL
PROVIDE A PRESENTATION.


[Captioner] 19:44:32
THANK YOU.
WELCOME, WAYLAND.


[Captioner] 19:44:39
>> THANK YOU AND GOOD

[Captioner] 19:44:43
 EVENING.


[Captioner] 19:45:08
STAFF HAS COME TO COUNCIL ON
SEVERAL OCCASIONS IN THE

[Captioner] 19:45:11
 PAST
YEAR TO SEEK OUTPUT AND TO GET
FEEDBACK ON

[Captioner] 19:45:14
 DRAFT HOUSING
ELEMENT.
TONIGHT'S PRESENTATION DIFFERS


[Captioner] 19:45:17
FROM THOSE PREVIOUS VISITS IN
THAT WE'RE NOW

[Captioner] 19:45:20
 REQUESTING FORMAL
ACTION FROM THE COUNCIL TO ADOPT
THE HOUSING ELEMENT.


[Captioner] 19:45:28
THIS SLIDE PROVIDES A QUICK
OVERVIEW OF TONIGHT'S
PRESENTATION.


[Captioner] 19:45:31
I'LL BEGIN WITH REVIEW OF THE
HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATE PROCESS,


[Captioner] 19:45:35
INCLUDING HOW WE GOT TO THIS
POINT AND WHAT LIES AHEAD.


[Captioner] 19:45:35





[Captioner] 19:45:36





[Captioner] 19:45:40
WE'LL ALSO REVIEW HIGHLIGHTS
FROM THE DRAFT HOUSING ELEMENT
AND

[Captioner] 19:45:43
 FINALLY I'LL DISCUSS MORE
RECENT CHANGES THAT STAFF HAS
MADE TO

[Captioner] 19:45:48
 THE DOCUMENT IN RESPONSE
TO FEEDBACK FROM

[Captioner] 19:45:54
 THE COMMUNITY.


[Captioner] 19:46:00
UNDER STATE LAW, ALL CITIES AND
COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA ARE
REQUIRED

[Captioner] 19:46:03
 TO HAVE AN ADOPTED PLAN
IN PLACE KNOWN AS A HOUSING
ELEMENT.


[Captioner] 19:46:06
TO MEET THE HOUSING NEEDS OF
EVERYONE IN THE COMMUNITY.
THE

[Captioner] 19:46:09
 HOUSING ELEMENT STRIVES TO
ENSURE THAT ALL PEOPLE

[Captioner] 19:46:13
 INCLUDING
THOSE AT THE LOWEST INCOME
LEVELS AND THOSE WITH SPECIAL


[Captioner] 19:46:16
HOUSING NEEDS INCLUDING SENIORS
AND THOSE WITH DISABILITIES HAVE


[Captioner] 19:46:20
ACCESS TO SAFE, AFFORDABLE, AND
ADEQUATE HOUSING WITHIN

[Captioner] 19:46:23
 THEIR


[Captioner] 19:46:27
COMMUNITIES.
THE HOUSING ELEMENT IS A CHAPTER
IN

[Captioner] 19:46:32
 THE CITY'S PLAN FOR GROWTH
AND DEVELOPMENT IN THE CITY.
THE HOUSING

[Captioner] 19:46:35
 ELEMENT IS A LITTLE
DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHER
CHAPTERS OF THE GENERAL

[Captioner] 19:46:39
 PLAN, IN
THAT HOUSING ELEMENT IS REQUIRED
BY LAW TO BE

[Captioner] 19:46:41
 UPDATED EVERY EIGHT
YEARS.
AND IT'S SUBJECT TO REVIEW AND


[Captioner] 19:46:45
APPROVAL BY STATE HCD TO ENSURE
THAT IT'S IN ALIGNMENT

[Captioner] 19:46:48
 WITH THE
STATE'S HOUSING RULES.


[Captioner] 19:46:52
SINCE THE LAST TIME WE ADOPTED A
HOUSING ELEMENT BACK

[Captioner] 19:46:56
 IN 2015,
OUR HOUSING NEEDS HAVE CHANGED
CONSIDERABLY.


[Captioner] 19:46:59
WE SAW THE STATE'S HOUSING
CRISIS BECOME MORE

[Captioner] 19:47:02
 PRONOUNCED,
HOUSING BECOME MORE
UNAFFORDABLE, RATES

[Captioner] 19:47:05
 OF
HOMELESSNESS INCREASE, AND WE
SAW THE

[Captioner] 19:47:09
 DISPARITIES IN ACCESS TO
HOUSING IN OUR COMMUNITIES
BECOME MORE APPARENT.


[Captioner] 19:47:15
THE STATE RESPONDED TO THIS
HOUSING CRISIS IN A COUPLE OF


[Captioner] 19:47:19
KEYWAYS.
INCLUDING ONE, TAKING AWAY A LOT


[Captioner] 19:47:22
OF LOCAL CONTROL OVER APPROVAL
OF HOUSING

[Captioner] 19:47:25
 DEVELOPMENTS, AND
TWO, PLACING MANY, MANY, MANY


[Captioner] 19:47:29
ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS ON LOCAL
HOUSING ELEMENTS TO BE SURE

[Captioner] 19:47:32
 THAT
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE DOING
THEIR PART TO ADDRESS THE


[Captioner] 19:47:35
HOUSING CRISIS IN THE STATE.


[Captioner] 19:47:38
THESE CHANGES INCLUDE ADDITIONAL
REQUIREMENTS TO

[Captioner] 19:47:43
 ADDRESS FAIR
HOUSING AND MORE RULES AND MORE
EXPECTATIONS

[Captioner] 19:47:46
 TO HAVE MEANINGFUL
AND ACTIONABLE PROGRAMS.


[Captioner] 19:47:52
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT MANY
JURISDICTIONS IN THE STATE HAVE
STRUGGLED

[Captioner] 19:47:57
 WITH.
THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA REGION
WHERE HOUSING ELEMENTS WERE DUE


[Captioner] 19:48:00
OVER A YEAR AGO, A HUGE NUMBER
OF THOSE JURISDICTIONS STILL
DON'T HAVE

[Captioner] 19:48:03
 A CERTIFIED HOUSING
ELEMENT OVER A YEAR

[Captioner] 19:48:07
 LATER.
ONE OF THE MAJOR REASONS WHY IS
BECAUSE THE

[Captioner] 19:48:10
 HOUSING NEEDS THAT
CITIES NOW NEED TO PLAN FOR ARE
SO MUCH

[Captioner] 19:48:13
 HIGHER THAN EVER BEFORE.


[Captioner] 19:48:17
SINCE THE 1970s, THERE'S BEEN
A PROCESS IN PLACE

[Captioner] 19:48:20
 IN CALIFORNIA
CALLED THE REGIONAL HOUSING
NEEDS ALLOCATION, OR

[Captioner] 19:48:23
 RHNA
PROCESS.
WHEN THE STATE CALCULATES

[Captioner] 19:48:26
 WHAT
THE HOUSING NEEDS OF A REGION
ARE, AND THEN THE

[Captioner] 19:48:29
 REGIONAL
COUNCIL OF GOVERNMENTS DECIDES
AND

[Captioner] 19:48:33
 DETERMINES HOW TO FAIRLY
DISTRIBUTE THAT NEED AMONG THE


[Captioner] 19:48:36
VARIOUS CITIES IN THE REGION.
THEN THE RESPONSIBILITY

[Captioner] 19:48:39
 OF LOCAL
CITIES IS TO HAVE A

[Captioner] 19:48:42
 HOUSING
ELEMENT AND ZONING IN PLACE TO
BE ABLE TO ACCOMMODATE THOSE


[Captioner] 19:48:45
NEEDS.
BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH

[Captioner] 19:48:48
 CITIES
AREN'T OUT THERE PHYSICALLY
BUILDING THE HOUSING, WE

[Captioner] 19:48:51
 ARE
PUTTING THE RULES AND THE
POLICIES IN PLACE THAT ALLOWS


[Captioner] 19:48:54
HOUSING TO BE PRODUCED.


[Captioner] 19:48:59
SO THIS UPCOMING

[Captioner] 19:49:02
 HOUSING CYCLE
HAVE DETERMINED THE HOUSING
NEEDS WERE MORE

[Captioner] 19:49:05
 THAN TWICE WHAT
THEY WERE IN THE PREVIOUS CYCLE.
ONCE THE REGIONAL NEED WAS


[Captioner] 19:49:08
DISTRIBUTED, FREMONT'S RHNA WAS
SET

[Captioner] 19:49:12
 AT 12,897 UNITS FOR THIS
UPCOMING CYCLE.
WHEREAS IT WAS

[Captioner] 19:49:15
 ONLY ABOUT 5400
IN THE PREVIOUS

[Captioner] 19:49:23
 CYCLE.
TO SHOW THE ZONING AND SITES IN
PLACE TO BE ABLE TO

[Captioner] 19:49:26
 ACCOMMODATE
ALL THOSE UNITS OVER THE NEXT
EIGHT

[Captioner] 19:49:30
 YEARS.
FORTUNATELY OUR

[Captioner] 19:49:35
 GENERAL PLAN
WHICH WE ADOPTED IN 2011 WAS


[Captioner] 19:49:38
VERY FORWARD THINKING,

[Captioner] 19:49:41
 URBAN
GROWTH STRATEGY ENCOURAGES NEW
HOUSING NEAR MAJOR TRANSIT

[Captioner] 19:49:44
 HUBS.


[Captioner] 19:49:49
THIS HAS ALLOWED THE PROCESS TO
FOCUS

[Captioner] 19:49:53
 LESS ENERGY TO FIGURE OUT
WHERE TO GROW BUT TO REALLY
FOCUS ON

[Captioner] 19:49:56
 SOLVING FOR WHAT
MEANINGFUL

[Captioner] 19:49:59
 PROGRAMS AND WHAT
MEANINGFUL ACTIONS WILL ACTUALLY
HELP US TO ACHIEVE

[Captioner] 19:50:03
 OUR HOUSING
GOALS.
NEXT SLIDE,

[Captioner] 19:50:08
 PLEASE.
SINCE HOUSING IS A CRITICAL NEED
FOR

[Captioner] 19:50:11
 EVERYONE IN THE COMMUNITY,
STAFF PLACES GREAT

[Captioner] 19:50:15
 EMPHASIS
DURING THIS PROCESS ON CREATING
OPPORTUNITIES FOR EVERYONE

[Captioner] 19:50:18
 TO BE
HEARD.
WITH

[Captioner] 19:50:21
 PARTICULAR EMPHASIS ON
PHYSICALLY GOING OUT TO THE
PEOPLE THAT HAVE THE

[Captioner] 19:50:24
 GREATEST
HOUSING CHALLENGES.
ALTHOUGH WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON


[Captioner] 19:50:27
THE HOUSING ELEMENT FOR A COUPLE
OF YEARS NOW, OUR

[Captioner] 19:50:31
 ENGAGEMENT
PROCESS REALLY KICKED INTO HIGH
GEAR AT THE BEGINNING

[Captioner] 19:50:34
 OF 2022,
WHEN STAFF WENT ON A TOUR TO
VISIT THE CITY'S

[Captioner] 19:50:40
 VARIOUS ROADS
AND CONDITIONS TO COLLECT
FEEDBACK FROM THE UNIQUE


[Captioner] 19:50:43
PERSPECTIVE IN THEIR MISSIONS.
WE ALSO TOOK A MULTIPRONGED
REACH EFFORT

[Captioner] 19:50:46
 WHERE WE CONDUCTED
OFFICE HOURS, WHERE PEOPLE COULD


[Captioner] 19:50:50
TALK WITH HOUSING ELEMENT TEAM.


[Captioner] 19:50:53
WE ATTENDED COMMUNITY EVENTS,
HELPED FOCUS

[Captioner] 19:50:56
 GROUPS AND VISITED
AFFORDABLE HOUSING COMPLEXES AS
WELL AS THE

[Captioner] 19:50:59
 SUNRISE VILLAGE
SHELTER TO GET INPUT FROM A
RANGE OF RESIDENTS THROUGHOUT


[Captioner] 19:51:02
THE

[Captioner] 19:51:07
 COMMUNITY.
STAFF TOOK IN ALL THIS INPUT
FROM VARIOUS SOURCES

[Captioner] 19:51:10
 AND WE
IDENTIFIED TWO THINGS OF
ENGAGEMENT

[Captioner] 19:51:13
 WHICH WE USE AS A
FOUNDATION IN PREPARING A DRAFT
HOUSING ELEMENT

[Captioner] 19:51:17
 WHICH WAS
RELEASED IN JULY OF LAST YEAR.


[Captioner] 19:51:20
NEXT SLIDE, PLEASE.


[Captioner] 19:51:28
THIS DRAFT HOUSING ELEMENT TOOK
A HIGHLY

[Captioner] 19:51:31
 AMBITIOUS POLICY EFFORT
CONSISTING OF

[Captioner] 19:51:35
 OVER 90 PROGRAMS
AND SIX MAIN GOALS TO MEET THE
HOUSING NEEDS OF FREMONT


[Captioner] 19:51:38
RESIDENTS.
THIS INCLUDED PRESERVING AND
MAINTAINING AND IMPROVING THE


[Captioner] 19:51:42
EXISTING HOUSING SUPPLY, HELPING
CURRENT

[Captioner] 19:51:45
 RESIDENTS MAINTAIN
STABLE AND

[Captioner] 19:51:49
 SAFE HOUSING,
PROMOTING PRODUCTION OF NEW


[Captioner] 19:51:52
HOUSING, MAXIMIZING SUPPORT AND
RESOURCES FOR AFFORDABLE
HOUSING,

[Captioner] 19:51:56
 ADDRESSING DISPARITIES
IN ACCESS TO HOUSING
OPPORTUNITIES

[Captioner] 19:52:00
 AND
DISPROPORTIONATE HOUSING NEEDS
AND MAINTAINING A COMPLIANT


[Captioner] 19:52:04
HOUSING ELEMENT AND ZONING.


[Captioner] 19:52:09
BECAUSE THERE'S SO MANY LEGALLY
REQUIRED PIECES TO A HOUSING
ELEMENT

[Captioner] 19:52:12
 LIKE A NEEDS ASSESSMENT,
REVIEW OF

[Captioner] 19:52:16
 A PREVIOUS HOUSING


[Captioner] 19:52:19
ELEMENT, STAFF MADE IT A CORE
PRINCIPLE OF THE

[Captioner] 19:52:22
 HOUSING ELEMENT
THAT EACH OF THE SIX GOALS AND
EACH OF THE

[Captioner] 19:52:26
 90-PLUS PROGRAMS IN
THE DOCUMENT NEEDED

[Captioner] 19:52:29
 TO
SPECIFICALLY TIE BACK TO A

[Captioner] 19:52:32
 KEY
FINDING OR KEY THEME OF
ENGAGEMENT FOUND IN THE

[Captioner] 19:52:35

DOCUMENT, MEANING THAT IF YOU
TAKE ANY ONE OF THE PROGRAMS


[Captioner] 19:52:38
LISTED IN

[Captioner] 19:52:41
 THE DOCUMENT TELLS YOU
HOW IT RELATES TO WHAT WE HEARD
IN THE COMMUNITY

[Captioner] 19:52:45
 AND TELLS YOU
WHATTISH YOU'LL OR PROBLEM WE
IDENTIFIED

[Captioner] 19:52:48
 THAT WE'RE TRYING TO
SOLVE FOR.
I'LL ALSO NOTE THE DRAFT

[Captioner] 19:52:51
 HOUSING
ELEMENT CONTAINS AN EQUITABLE
SITES INVENTORY,

[Captioner] 19:52:54
 THE PLANS FOR
HOUSING IN AREAS OF

[Captioner] 19:52:58
 HIGH
OPPORTUNITY, WHICH ARE AREAS
WHERE LOW INCOME

[Captioner] 19:53:02
 RESIDENTS HAVE
ACCESS TO QUALITY EDUCATION,


[Captioner] 19:53:05
EMPLOYMENT, AND A HEALTHY
ENVIRONMENT WHICH LEADS TO MORE
POSITIVE

[Captioner] 19:53:08
 LIFE

[Captioner] 19:53:13
 OUTCOMES.
ALSO OVER IS IT 5% OF INVENTORY
SITES ARE LOCATED IN

[Captioner] 19:53:16
 PRIORITY
DEVELOPMENT AREAS, OR PDAs,
WHICH

[Captioner] 19:53:20
 IS CONSISTENT WITH THE
GENERAL PLAN'S VISION

[Captioner] 19:53:23
 FOR
MEETING HOUSING NEEDS TO A
STRATEGIC

[Captioner] 19:53:26
 TRANSIT-ORIENTED
DEVELOPMENT.


[Captioner] 19:53:35
THIS SLIDE SUMMARIZES THE LONG
ROAD WE TOOK

[Captioner] 19:53:38
 FROM THIS FIRST
PUBLIC DRAFT IN JULY TO WHERE WE
ARE TODAY WITH

[Captioner] 19:53:41
 THE DRAFT
CONSIDERED FOR ADOPTION.


[Captioner] 19:53:45
WHEN WE RELEASED THE DRAFT IN
JULY, OUR OUTREACH

[Captioner] 19:53:48
 STRATEGY
PIVOTED TO A SECOND PHASE WHERE


[Captioner] 19:53:51
THE FOCUS SHIFTED TO FINDING
WAYS TO REFINE

[Captioner] 19:53:54
 AND IMPROVE THE
DRAFT.


[Captioner] 19:53:57
AS A CORNER STOANT EVENT IN THE
SECOND STAGE OF

[Captioner] 19:54:01
 ENGAGEMENT,
STAFF HELD A DROP-IN OPEN HOUSE
ON

[Captioner] 19:54:06
 AUGUST 3RD OF THE DOWNTOWN
EVENT CENTER.
ABOUT 20 MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC


[Captioner] 19:54:10
ATTENDED AND WE HAD A REALLY
GREAT DISCUSSION.


[Captioner] 19:54:13
AFTER 30 DAYS OF RECEIVING
PUBLIC INPUT,

[Captioner] 19:54:16
 STAFF MADE EDITS
BASED ON WHAT WE HEARD AND WE

STATE HCD FOR

[Captioner] 19:54:22

OF THESE CONVERSATIONS, WE DID


[Captioner] 19:54:34

[Captioner] 19:59:27
ENVIRONMENTAL REVEUL WITH

[Captioner] 19:59:29
 A CHECKLIST
IS INCLUDED IN YOUR PACKET
TONIGHT.


[Captioner] 19:59:34
THIS CONCLUDES MY PRESENTATION.
STAFF IS AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY


[Captioner] 19:59:37
QUESTIONS THAT THE COUNCIL MAY
HAVE.


[Captioner] 19:59:42
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU FOR THE
PRESENTATION.
AND AT THIS TIME, I'D LIKE TO


[Captioner] 19:59:45
TURN IT OVER TO QUESTIONS FROM
THE COUNCILMEMBERS AND I'LL


[Captioner] 19:59:48
BEGIN WITH COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN.


[Captioner] 19:59:52
>> Councilmember Kassan: THANK
YOU.
I'M JUST SO IMPRESSED,

[Captioner] 19:59:55
 IT SOUNDS
LIKE WE'RE ONE OF THE BEST
CITIES IN THE

[Captioner] 19:59:58
 STATE WITH OUR
HOUSING ELEMENT, AND JUST SO
PROUD AND

[Captioner] 20:00:02
 INSTEAD OF KICKING AND
SCREAMING, WE DID WHAT WE NEEDED
TO GET DONE

[Captioner] 20:00:05
 SO CONGRATULATIONS
ON THAT.
MY ONLY

[Captioner] 20:00:09
 QUESTIONS ARE THERE WERE
TWO COMMENTS SUBMITTED

[Captioner] 20:00:12
 THAT I
WONDERED IF THEY HAD BEEN
ADDRESSED SO THERE

[Captioner] 20:00:15
 WERE SOME
COMMENTS FROM FREMONT

[Captioner] 20:00:18
 FOR
EVERYONE REGARDING PROACTIVE
ENFORCEMENT

[Captioner] 20:00:21
 OF SUBSTANDARD
HOUSING VIOLATIONS.
I THOUGHT THAT

[Captioner] 20:00:24
 WAS A GOOD
COMMENT ADD I'D LIKE TO SEE THAT


[Captioner] 20:00:28
RESPONDED TO.
THERE WERE ALSO SOME OTHER
COMMENTS ABOUT

[Captioner] 20:00:32
 THE SITES'
INVENTORY.
I UNDERSTAND THOSE MAY NOT BE AS


[Captioner] 20:00:36
IMPORTANT BECAUSE SINCE WE MET
THE

[Captioner] 20:00:39
 REQUIRED SITES, IT MAY NOT
BE SO IMPORTANT TO

[Captioner] 20:00:42
 WORRY ABOUT
THE DETAILS OF THAT, BUT I WOULD
LOVE TO HEAR YOUR RESPONSES TO


[Captioner] 20:00:45
THE FREMONT FOR EVERYONE LETTER,
AND THEN IN ADDITION TO

[Captioner] 20:00:49
 THAT,
THE

[Captioner] 20:00:53
 COMMENT FROM -- REGARDING
THE PROVISION

[Captioner] 20:00:56
 REGARDING LABOR
FORCE READINESS, THERE

[Captioner] 20:00:59
 WAS A
SUGGESTION ABOUT ADDING SOME


[Captioner] 20:01:02
LANGUAGE ABOUT LABOR STANDARDS
CONDUCIVE TO ENSURING THE

[Captioner] 20:01:05

RELIABLE SUPPLY OF QUALITY
CONSTRUCTION LABOR, AND I


[Captioner] 20:01:09
THOUGHT THAT SOUNDED LIKE GOOD
LANGUAGE TO ADD, AND IT SOUNDS
LIKE

[Captioner] 20:01:12
 YOU PROPOSED AN ALTERNATIVE
THAT

[Captioner] 20:01:15
 IS NOT QUITE AS STRONG IN
TERMS OF EXPRESSING

[Captioner] 20:01:20
 SUPPORT FOR
HIGH QUALITY LABOR STANDARDS, SO
I WAS WONDERING IF I COULD GET


[Captioner] 20:01:23
SOME RESPONSES TO THOSE.


[Captioner] 20:01:27
>> SURE.
I'LL BE HAPPY TO RESPOND TO
THOSE.


[Captioner] 20:01:32
WITH REGARDS TO THE RECENT
COMMUNICATION

[Captioner] 20:01:38
 REGARDING -- THE
COMMUNICATION RECENTLY RECEIVED


[Captioner] 20:01:43
REGARDING -- LABOR, STAFF
THOUGHT THEY WERE FAIR COMMENTS.


[Captioner] 20:01:46
I THINK THEREAFTER, INCLUDING
SOME LANGUAGE

[Captioner] 20:01:49
 WITHIN THE HOUSING
ELEMENT RECOGNIZING THE KEY ROLE


[Captioner] 20:01:53
THAT AN ADEQUATE CONSTRUCTION
LABOR FORCE

[Captioner] 20:01:56
 PLAYS IN BEING ABLE
TO DELIVER THE HOUSING PROVISION
OF THE

[Captioner] 20:02:00
 HOUSING ELEMENT.
SO I THINK THAT'S A FAIR --
STAFF

[Captioner] 20:02:03
 THOUGHT THAT WAS A

[Captioner] 20:02:06
 FAIR
REQUEST, AND WE DID PREPARE SOME
LANGUAGE THAT WE

[Captioner] 20:02:11
 THOUGHT WAS
APPROPRIATE

[Captioner] 20:02:14
 TO INCLUDE, NOT
PREVIOUSLY

[Captioner] 20:02:17
 DISCUSSING THIS WITH
THE COUNCIL BEFORE BUT BASICALLY
SAYING RECOGNIZING THAT LABOR

[Captioner] 20:02:21
 IS
IMPORTANT AND WE HAVE A


[Captioner] 20:02:24
COMMITMENT THROUGH ONE OF OUR
PROGRAMS TO CONSULT

[Captioner] 20:02:27
 WITH
STAKEHOLDERS ON CHANGES TO THE
HOUSING POLICY, WHICH

[Captioner] 20:02:29
 INCLUDES
THOSE IN THE CONSTRUCTION
INDUSTRY.


[Captioner] 20:02:36
>> Councilmember Kassan: CAN I
ASK A QUESTION ON THAT ONE, THEY
DID PROPOSE SOME LANGUAGE AND

[Captioner] 20:02:39
 I
WAS JUST WONDERING WHY YOU
DIDN'T JUST GO AHEAD AND ACCEPT


[Captioner] 20:02:42
THE LANGUAGE THAT THEY HAD


[Captioner] 20:02:47
PROPOSED?
THIS IS THE CARPENTER'S UNION.


[Captioner] 20:02:55
>> I DON'T THINK THERE'S
ANYTHING WRONG WITH THE LANGUAGE
THEY

[Captioner] 20:02:58
 HAD PROPOSED, THINK WE JUST
HAD A PREFERENCE IN THE WAY WE
PHRASE IT.


[Captioner] 20:03:05
>> Councilmember Kassan: WOULD
YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE


[Captioner] 20:03:10
LANGUAGE PROPOSED REPLACING WHAT
YOU HAD PUT WITH

[Captioner] 20:03:12
 WHAT THEY HAD


[Captioner] 20:03:16
SUGGESTED?
>> IF THAT'S THE COUNCIL'S
PREFERENCE, I THINK STAFF WOULD


[Captioner] 20:03:19
BE FINE WITH THAT.
>> Councilmember Kassan: AND
THEN SORRY I INTERRUPTED YOU,


[Captioner] 20:03:22
COULD MAYBE ANSWER THE PART
ABOUT THE FREMONT FOR EVERYONE
LETTER.


[Captioner] 20:03:25
THANK

[Captioner] 20:03:29
 YOU.
>> SURE.
WITH REGARDS TO SITES INVENTORY,


[Captioner] 20:03:32
I FORGET WHAT THE COMMENTS WERE,
BUT I

[Captioner] 20:03:36
 THINK THAT PERHAPS IF JOEL
CAN GIVE ME A HAND

[Captioner] 20:03:39
 WITH THE CODE


[Captioner] 20:03:42
ENFORCEMENT, I CAN REFRESH MY
MEMORY OF WHAT THE

[Captioner] 20:03:45
 SITES
INVENTORY COMMENT -- IN A BIT.
>> I SURE CAN.


[Captioner] 20:03:48
THANK YOU, WAYLAND.
AND SO DEALING WITH

[Captioner] 20:03:52
 THE CODE
ENFORCEMENT

[Captioner] 20:03:55
 ISSUE FIRST, OUR
CODE ENFORCEMENT STAFF DOES

[Captioner] 20:03:59
 HAVE


[Captioner] 20:04:05
A

[Captioner] 20:04:08
 INTERNAL POLICY WHERE WHEN BE
HAVE A

[Captioner] 20:04:11
 CERTAIN NUMBER OF
COMPLAINTS RAISED IN A HOUSING
SWAIG, THAT WE'LL CONTINUE TO


[Captioner] 20:04:15
LOOK WITHIN THOSE ADJACENT UNITS
WHEN

[Captioner] 20:04:18
 THERE IS A PATTERN

[Captioner] 20:04:22
 CLEAR TO
TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE
AREN'T OTHER

[Captioner] 20:04:25
 SIMILAR SITUATIONS.


[Captioner] 20:04:29
HOWEVER, THAT'S CONSTRAINED BY
OUR CODE ENFORCEMENT

[Captioner] 20:04:32
 STAFFING,
AND SO TO

[Captioner] 20:04:36
 ENSHRINE SOMETHING
MORE AGGRESSIVE THAN THAT


[Captioner] 20:04:39
CITYWIDE WOULD BE AN ISSUE FOR
US TO BE ABLE TO

[Captioner] 20:04:43
 RESPOND TO IN
TERMS OF COMMITTING TO THE

[Captioner] 20:04:46
 STATE
THAT WE'RE

[Captioner] 20:04:49
 GOING TO OPERATE AT
THAT MUCH HIGHER LEVEL.
SO

[Captioner] 20:04:52
 IF WE RESPOND TO A

[Captioner] 20:04:56
SO IF WE RESPOND TO A L 
MULTIUNIT

[Captioner] 20:05:00
 CONDO OR APARTMENT, WE 
HAVE SEVERAL

[Captioner] 20:05:03
 THAT HAVE A SEWAGE 
OR WATER A

[Captioner] 20:05:06
JILG ISSUE OR 
SOMETHING LIKE THAT, WE HAVE A 
CASE-BY-CASE

[Captioner] 20:05:12
 BASIS ADDRESS THAT 
MORE GLOBALLY.
WE

[Captioner] 20:05:16
 ARE TRYING TO HAVE A VERY 
HIGH

[Captioner] 20:05:19
 STANDARD WHERE WE WOULD 
HIRE MORE

[Captioner] 20:05:22
 COID ENFORCEMENT 
OFFICERS TO DO THAT AND TO 
COMMIT TO THAT ON

[Captioner] 20:05:25
GOING BASIS.

[Captioner] 20:05:27

>> Councilmember Kassan:   
RIGHT, THAT IS PROBABLY A 


[Captioner] 20:05:31
PROBLEM FOR ALL CITIES THAT WE 
DON'T HAVE ALL STAFF

[Captioner] 20:05:34
 TO 
PROACTIVELY INSPECT ALL ISSUES 
AND

[Captioner] 20:05:37
 WE HAVE TO BE COMPLAINT 
DRIVEN AND HOPEFULLY

[Captioner] 20:05:41
 WE CAN MAKE 
IT A GOAL TO WORK ON THAT BUT I 
HEAR WHAT YOU'RE

[Captioner] 20:05:44
 SAYING.
ALL RIGHT ANY OTHER COMMENTS ON 
THE FREMONT

[Captioner] 20:05:47
 FOR EVERYONE LETTER?

[Captioner] 20:05:53

>> I SEE A COMMENT ON THE 
TREATMENT FOR EVERYONE LETTER

[Captioner] 20:05:56
 
ASKING WHY SITES FROM THE 
PRIVACY HOUSING

[Captioner] 20:05:59
 SIGNING WILL 
BE -- WHY STAFF BELIEVES

[Captioner] 20:06:03
 THAT 
SITES USED FROM THE

[Captioner] 20:06:06
 PREVIOUS 
CYCLE WOULD BE DEVELOPMENT

[Captioner] 20:06:09
 
DURING THE HOUSING CYCLE.
I THINK STAFF

[Captioner] 20:06:13
'S RESPONSE IS 
CHAPTER 2 OF THE HOUSING 
DEVELOPMENT WHICH IS

[Captioner] 20:06:16
 OUR GOALS 
IS POLICIES AND PROGRAMS COMMITS 
A

[Captioner] 20:06:19
 SLATE OF IMPLEMENTATION 
MEASURES WITH THE STATED GOAL

[Captioner] 20:06:22
 OF  
PROMOTING PRODUCTION HOUSING 
DURING THIS PERIOD

[Captioner] 20:06:26
.
ALSO I THINK THE -- OUR ANALYSIS

[Captioner] 20:06:29
 
OF INVENTORY SITES IDENTIFIED 
SOME REALLY

[Captioner] 20:06:32
 KEY CHARACTERISTICS 
WHICH DATA

[Captioner] 20:06:36
 SHOWS

[Captioner] 20:06:42
 AS 
CHARACTERISTIC OF THE SITES

[Captioner] 20:06:45
 T TO 
BE DEVELOPED AS HOUSING.
SO I THINK FOR

[Captioner] 20:06:49
 THOSE REASONS 
THAT

[Captioner] 20:06:55
 THERE IS A STRONGER 
LIKELIHOOD THAT THOSE SITES WILL

[Captioner] 20:06:58
 
BE DEVELOPED WITH HOUSING.


[Captioner] 20:07:01
>> Councilmember Kassan:   WELL 
THAT MAKES SENSE AND I JUST 
AGAIN WANT TO THANK

[Captioner] 20:07:04
 STAFF ALL 
THE ENTIRE STAFF FOR YOUR 
AMAZING WORK ON THIS.


[Captioner] 20:07:08
I'M JUST SO PROUD THAT WE'VE 
DONE SUCH

[Captioner] 20:07:11
 A GREAT JOB ON OUR 
HOUSING ELEMENT.
THANK YOU

[Captioner] 20:07:16
.

[Captioner] 20:07:25

>> Mayor Mei:   THERE ARE ANY 
OTHER CLARIFYING QUESTIONS?


[Captioner] 20:07:28
IF NOT I'M GOING TO OPEN THE 
PUBLIC HEARING.
MEMBERS OF THE

[Captioner] 20:07:31
 PUBLIC WISHING TO 
SPEAK ON THIS ITEM MAY DO SO BY 
CLICK

[Captioner] 20:07:34
ING ON THE RAISE HAND ICON 
OR BY CALLING

[Captioner] 20:07:37
 BY DIALING STAR 9 
AND ALSO THERE MAY HAVE

[Captioner] 20:07:41
 BEEN 
SOME SPEAKER CARDS

[Captioner] 20:07:44
 RAISED, I'M 
NOT SURE.
I'LL

[Captioner] 20:07:47
 TURN IT TO THE CITY CLERK 
TO SEE.
>> The Clerk:  

[Captioner] 20:07:50
 WE CURRENTLY 
HAVE A CARD FROM LISA

[Captioner] 20:07:55
 DANS.
>> Mayor Mei:   WELCOME

[Captioner] 20:07:59
 MS. DANN 
IT WILL.
>> IT IS WONDERFUL

[Captioner] 20:08:02
 TO BE BACK IN 
THE FREMONT CITY COUNCIL CHAMBER

[Captioner] 20:08:06

CHAMBER.
WE ARE IN INCLUSIVE

[Captioner] 20:08:09
 AFFORDABLE 
HOUSING FOR ALL.
FIRST OF ALL I

[Captioner] 20:08:12
 HOPE YOU WILL 
VOTE TO ADOPT THE HOUSING

[Captioner] 20:08:15
 
ELEMENT TONIGHT.
IT'S CIEM TIME WE'RE COMING UP 


[Captioner] 20:08:18
ON THE DEADLINE.
I ALSO WANT TO I WOULD

[Captioner] 20:08:21
 LIKE TO 
VERY MUCH THANK CITY STAFF FOR 
ALL THE WORK ON

[Captioner] 20:08:25
 IT.

[Captioner] 20:08:28

BOTH WHO YOU HEARD FROM AS WELL 
AS COURTNEY

[Captioner] 20:08:31
, AND JOEL AND MORE

[Captioner] 20:08:34
 
WHOSE NAMES I DON'T KNOW.
I KNOW THEY WORKED INCREDIBLY 


[Captioner] 20:08:37
HARD AND JUST TO PILE ON TO WHAT

[Captioner] 20:08:41
 
WAYLAND MENTIONED I HAVE PERSONS 
AS WELL

[Captioner] 20:08:44
 WHO LOOK AT MULTIPLE 
CITIES AND WE HAVE ONE OF THE

[Captioner] 20:08:46
 
BETTER HOUSING ELEMENTS.
AND ONE OF THE PROGRAMS THAT HE 


[Captioner] 20:08:50
MENTIONED WAS UPDATED BASED ON

[Captioner] 20:08:53
 
WHAT YOUR CD SAID, I LOOKED INTO 
THAT,

[Captioner] 20:08:56
 IT WAS NOT SOMETHING 
WITHIN THE HOUSING

[Captioner] 20:08:59
 ELEMENT BUT 
WITHIN THE COID

[Captioner] 20:09:02
.
SO BEING

[Captioner] 20:09:06
 DECENT ORIENTED AND 
THEY STILL HAVE VERY LITTLE TO

[Captioner] 20:09:09
 
SAY, SO I WANT TO GIVE THAT 
(INAUDIBLE)

[Captioner] 20:09:12
 I THINK.

[Captioner] 20:09:14

AS THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE 
FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS ON THAT, I 


[Captioner] 20:09:18
DO APPRECIATE THAT VERY MUCH.
I WANTED TO DIG IN A LITTLE BIT 
MORE

[Captioner] 20:09:21
 ABOUT THE ENFORCEMENT.
I UNDERSTAND THAT IT IS

[Captioner] 20:09:24
 A 
RESOURCE ISSUE.
SO IF

[Captioner] 20:09:27
 IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT WE 
CAN COMMIT TO WITH THE STATE IN 
THIS DOCUMENT,

[Captioner] 20:09:30
 I HOPE THAT WHEN 
WE THINK ABOUT THE BUDGET COMING

[Captioner] 20:09:33
 
UP IN I THINK JUNE, WE THINK 
THAT

[Captioner] 20:09:37
 WE OUGHT TO BE PUTTING MORE 
RESOURCES HERE.
I UNDERSTAND WE

[Captioner] 20:09:40
 CAN'T GO OUT AND 
INSPECT EVERY SINGLE

[Captioner] 20:09:43
 APARTMENT 
IN THE CITY THAT WOULD BE 
UNTENABLE

[Captioner] 20:09:46
.
THE PROBLEM WITH

[Captioner] 20:09:49
 REQUIRING

[Captioner] 20:09:52
 
COMPLAINTS, NEIGHBORS

[Captioner] 20:09:56
, SOMEBODY 
COMPLAINED.
A LANDLORD THAT IS

[Captioner] 20:09:59
 NOT ALREADY 
AMENABLE TO HAVING A

[Captioner] 20:10:02
 HABITABLE 
HOUSE, ANYONE WHO

[Captioner] 20:10:05
 COMPLAINS WITH 
HABITABILITY ISSUE IS A PROBLEM

[Captioner] 20:10:09
 
TENANT AND THAT COULD BE AN 
UNTENABLE LIVING SITUATION

[Captioner] 20:10:12
 AND 
ESPECIALLY IF SOMEBODY IS 
RELYING ON AFFORDABLE HOUSING 


[Captioner] 20:10:15
THEY DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE THE 
MOBILITY TO MOVE SOMEWHERE ELSE

[Captioner] 20:10:19
 
BECAUSE THEIR -- WHATEVER 
AFFORDABLE HOUSING SETUP THEY 


[Captioner] 20:10:22
HAVE MIGHT NOT GIVE THEM THAT.
I DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT IF 
IT'S NOT

[Captioner] 20:10:26
 GOING TO BE IN THIS 
DOCUMENT I DO HOPE IT'S GOING TO 
BE A PRIORITY

[Captioner] 20:10:29
 WITH THE CITY 
COUNCIL LATER.
AND I ALSO FINALLY JUST WANT

[Captioner] 20:10:32
 TO 
SAY THAT HOUSING PRODUCTION IS 
THE BIGGEST

[Captioner] 20:10:35
 PART OF THE ANSWER 
TO WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO

[Captioner] 20:10:38
 ABOUT 
HOMELESSNESS, WHAT ARE WE GOING 
TO DO

[Captioner] 20:10:42
 WITH WHAT THE SPEAKERS 
MENTIONED EARLIER, I

[Captioner] 20:10:45
 WANT TO 
THANK THEM FOR RAISING THE 
ISSUE.


[Captioner] 20:10:48
THIS IS BIG ISSUE AND THIS IS 
OUR OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE A

[Captioner] 20:10:51
 BIG 
DIFFERENCE SO THANK YOU ALL.

[Captioner] 20:11:07

>> NEXT SPEAKER.
>> I WANT TO THANK STAFF FOR 


[Captioner] 20:11:10
SUBMITTING THIS WONDERFUL 
DOCUMENT.
THERE WERE LIKE NINE OR TEN 


[Captioner] 20:11:13
BILLS THAT WERE PASSED BY THE 
STATE.
WE SHOULD IMPLEMENT

[Captioner] 20:11:16
 ALL OF THOSE 
NINE OSH TEN BILLS INTO FREMONT.

[Captioner] 20:11:21

AND WE SHOULD NOT HAVE TOO MANY 
RESTRICTIONS

[Captioner] 20:11:24
.
AND GIVE YOU A CASE IN POINT

[Captioner] 20:11:28
, WE 
ARE TRYING TO BUILD

[Captioner] 20:11:32
 A COMPLEX

[Captioner] 20:11:42
 
FOR GETTING CEQA OKAY.
THE COST IS

[Captioner] 20:11:45
 ABOUT $125,000 PLUS 
CITY FEES

[Captioner] 20:11:48
 PLUS NINE MONTHS TO 
JUST GET THE

[Captioner] 20:11:51
 CEQA CERTIFICATION.
SO IF THIS DOCUMENT IS

[Captioner] 20:11:54
 PASSED, 
WE SAVE THAT TIME, WE SAVE THAT

[Captioner] 20:11:57
 
MONEY, AND THERE ARE MANY, MANY

[Captioner] 20:12:00
 
OTHER PEOPLE WHO WITH

[Captioner] 20:12:04
 WOULD LIKE TO 
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT.
THE

[Captioner] 20:12:08
 SECOND OPINION THAT I'M 
LOOKING TO BUY A HOTEL

[Captioner] 20:12:12
, BOLIVIA

[Captioner] 20:12:15
 
HOTEL ON MISSION BOULEVARD FOR 
BATTERED WOMEN

[Captioner] 20:12:18
 HOMES.
IT

[Captioner] 20:12:21
 COULD HOUSE 30 WOMEN WHO ARE 
BATTERED

[Captioner] 20:12:25
 AND LOW INCOME, I WOULD 
LIKE THE COOPERATION OF THE 
CITY.


[Captioner] 20:12:28
THE OWNER WANT TO SELL THE 
PROPERTY TO MAKE THE BATTERED

[Captioner] 20:12:31
 
WOMEN HOME.
IT IS A

[Captioner] 20:12:35
 35K LOT AND I WOULD COME 
INDIVIDUALLY TO DISCUSS IT SO

[Captioner] 20:12:39
 WE 
CAN HAVE A BETTER GOING ON RIGHT 
HERE IN

[Captioner] 20:12:42
 FREMONT.
THE THIRD THING IS,

[Captioner] 20:12:45
 THE SKILL 
INDICATED THAT WAS

[Captioner] 20:12:48
 PASSED IN THE 
TIME OF MAYOR

[Captioner] 20:12:53
 GUS

[Captioner] 20:12:57
 MORRISON, THE 
ONE IS FACING

[Captioner] 20:13:00
 THE CITY, THE 
OTHER ONE IS THE BACK SIDE OF 
THE HILL WHICH

[Captioner] 20:13:03
 IS NOT VISIBLE 
FROM THE CITY.
THERE IS A LOT OF LAND

[Captioner] 20:13:06
 HERE ON 
THE BACK SIDE OF THE HILL WHICH 
SHOULD

[Captioner] 20:13:10
 BE CONSIDERED

[Captioner] 20:13:15
 TO PUT 
ROADS AND BUILD HOMES THAT ARE

[Captioner] 20:13:18
 
NOT VISIBLE FROM THE CITY, THAT 
WAY WE WOULD HAVE AT

[Captioner] 20:13:21
 LEAST TEN 
TO 20,000 MORE HOMES IN THE

[Captioner] 20:13:25
 AREA 
WHICH IS

[Captioner] 20:13:28
 JUST THERE

[Captioner] 20:13:31
 AND 
(INAUDIBLE) THINK OUT OF THE

[Captioner] 20:13:35
 
BOX,

[Captioner] 20:13:38
 THINK CREATIVELY, GIVE THE 
PEOPLE WHAT THEY WANT AND

[Captioner] 20:13:41
 THEY 
WILL LOVE YOU FOR IT.
THANK YOU, I APPRECIATE

[Captioner] 20:13:44
 IT.
>> The Clerk:   THAT'S THE LAST 
SPEAKER.


[Captioner] 20:13:46
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.
AT THIS TIME I'LL CLOSE THE 
PUBLIC HEARING.


[Captioner] 20:13:51
AND I'LL TURN IT BACK TO THE 
COUNCIL FOR DISCUSSION

[Captioner] 20:13:54
.
I ALSO WANTED TO GIVE A QUICK 
REMINDER THAT WE

[Captioner] 20:13:58
 DO HAVE A BREAK 
THAT'S COMING UP FOR STENO

[Captioner] 20:14:01
 
CAPTIONER IF WE SHOULD EXCEED 
THAT TIME PERIOD

[Captioner] 20:14:05
 BUT WE'LL BEGIN 
WITH THE COMMENTS AT THIS TIME.
I THINK IT'S

[Captioner] 20:14:08
 AT 8:30 COMING UP.


[Captioner] 20:14:11
SO COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN.
>> Councilmember Kassan:   I'D 
LIKE TO MAKE A

[Captioner] 20:14:14
 MOTION THAT WE 
ACCEPT STAFF RECOMMENDATION WITH 
THAT ONE

[Captioner] 20:14:18
 CHANGE OF USING THE 
CARPENTERS

[Captioner] 20:14:20
 LANGUAGE UNION IN 
PLACE OF THE STAFF SUGGESTED 
LANGUAGE.


[Captioner] 20:14:29
>> Councilmember Cox:   SECOND.
>> Mayor Mei:   WELL I'D LIKE TO 
HAVE SOME

[Captioner] 20:14:32
 CONVERSATION STILL I 
APOLOGIZE, I THINK THERE ARE 
SOME

[Captioner] 20:14:36
 OTHER COUNCILMEMBERS WHO 
HAVE SOME COMMENTS

[Captioner] 20:14:39
 STILL, I HAVE 
COMMENTS

[Captioner] 20:14:42
.
COUNCILMEMBER COX DO YOU HAVE 
COMMENTS?


[Captioner] 20:14:45
>> Councilmember Cox:   I HAVE 
TWO CLARIFYING QUESTIONS, I 
THANK

[Captioner] 20:14:48
 SO MUCH TO OUR CITY STAFF, 
TO

[Captioner] 20:14:51
 WAY WAYLAND

[Captioner] 20:14:54
, AND JULY

[Captioner] 20:15:00
 JUL, AND I 
WANT TO THANK EVERYONE

[Captioner] 20:15:03
 IN 
FREMONT FOR THEIR COMMENTS.
AND KIND OF UNDERSTANDING A 


[Captioner] 20:15:07
LITTLE BIT MORE IN TERMS OF 
SINCE OUR LAND HAS A LOT OF HIGH 
VALUE

[Captioner] 20:15:10
, IS THERE -- HOW MUCH IS

[Captioner] 20:15:13
 
THERE A LEAD WAY IN ADDING

[Captioner] 20:15:16
 
ADDITIONAL UNITS PER A LOT, DOES 
THE CITY HAVE IN

[Captioner] 20:15:21
 ITS DISCRETION 
TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT?
I KNOW THERE'S

[Captioner] 20:15:25
 THE SB 10 THAT'S 
OUT THERE, BUT JUST TRYING TO

[Captioner] 20:15:29
 
SEE, AND THE SB 9 I THINK IT IS,

[Captioner] 20:15:32
 
FOR SOME SORT OF LOT-SPLITTING.
BUT IS THERE

[Captioner] 20:15:35
 SOME OTHER LEAD WAY 
THAT COULD HELP OUT THOSE

[Captioner] 20:15:38
 THAT 
WANTED TO BE ABLE TO BUILD ON

[Captioner] 20:15:41
 
THE LOTS?

[Captioner] 20:15:48

ADDITIONAL UNITS AND HOW MUCH 
LEAD WAY DO WE HAVE FOR THE

[Captioner] 20:15:52
 CITY 
IN OUR AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY 
THAT WE

[Captioner] 20:15:55
 COULD ADD OR CHANGE IN 
THIS

[Captioner] 20:15:58
 HOUSING ELEMENT, THAT'S THE 
ONE QUESTION I HAD.
AND I HAD

[Captioner] 20:16:01
 A FOLLOW-UP ON ANOTHER 
ONE.


[Captioner] 20:16:07
>> Planner Pullen:   
COUNCILMEMBER COX I'LL TAKE THAT 
AND WAYLAND MAY ADD

[Captioner] 20:16:11
 ON.
BUT IN WAYLAND

[Captioner] 20:16:14
'S PRESENTATION HE 
PROVIDED THE NUMBER THAT WE HAD 
BEEN REQUIRED TO MEET

[Captioner] 20:16:17
 PER STATE 
LAW AS 12,

[Captioner] 20:16:20
897.
WE'VE PROVIDED THROUGH

[Captioner] 20:16:23
 OUR SITES 
INVENTORY SOMEWHAT NORTH OF THAT 
NUMBER TO

[Captioner] 20:16:26
 PROVIDE A BIT OF A 
BUFFER AND TO FURTHER

[Captioner] 20:16:29
 ENCOURAGE 
HOUSING.
BUT ADDITIONALLY, IF YOU LOOK 


[Captioner] 20:16:34
WITHIN THE KIND OF THE NUMBERS 
THAT WAYLAND AND THE TEAM

[Captioner] 20:16:38
 HAVE 
PLACED ON THOSE PROPERTIES, 
THOSE ARE NOT

[Captioner] 20:16:43
 THE HIGHEST 
POSSIBLE NUMBERS.
THOSE

[Captioner] 20:16:46
 ARE CONSERVATIVELY 
ESTIMATED GIVEN

[Captioner] 20:16:50
 SITE 
CONSTRAINTS, GIVEN OTHER 
PROJECTS THAT HAVE COME BEFORE

[Captioner] 20:16:53
 
ON SIMILAR TYPE OF LOTS.
AND

[Captioner] 20:16:56
 SO WE'VE BEEN RELATIVELY

[Captioner] 20:16:59
 
CONSERVATIVE IN OUR NUMBER OF 
UNITS PER SITES

[Captioner] 20:17:02
 INVENTORY LOT, 
BASED ON, YOU KNOW, THE FACTS

[Captioner] 20:17:05
 ON 
THE GROUND AND NOT WANTING TO 
SORT OF

[Captioner] 20:17:09
 BE, YOU KNOW, TOO

[Captioner] 20:17:12
 OR 
WANT TO BE VERY REALISTIC.
AND SO

[Captioner] 20:17:15
 THOSE SITES, MANY OF THEM 
COULD DEVELOP AT A HIRE

[Captioner] 20:17:18
 NUMBER.
PEOPLE COULD DO A LOT OF

[Captioner] 20:17:22
 THINGS 
WITH, YOU KNOW, DENSITIES AT

[Captioner] 20:17:25
 
LOTS THAT MAY SHOW A MORE 
CONSERVATIVE NUMBER

[Captioner] 20:17:28
, TO 
ACCELERATE PRODUCTION OF HOUSING

[Captioner] 20:17:31

HOUSING.
SO THAT IS SORT OF BUILT IN, IN 


[Captioner] 20:17:34
THAT WAY.
WE DON'T NEED TO PER STATE LAW

[Captioner] 20:17:37
 
REGULATIONS STILL PASSED THAT 
INVENTORY

[Captioner] 20:17:41
 OR THAT RHNA THAT HAVE 
BEEN PROVIDED TO

[Captioner] 20:17:44
 US AND WE HAVE 
PROVIDED ALREADY A BUFFER ABOUT 
THAT

[Captioner] 20:17:47
.
>> Councilmember Cox:   SO WHAT 
YOU'RE SAYING BASICALLY JOEL IS 


[Captioner] 20:17:50
THE NUMBER THAT IS BEING 
REPRESENTED IS REALLY A

[Captioner] 20:17:54
 MINIMUM 
AMOUNT?
AND THERE'S SOME

[Captioner] 20:17:57
 FLEXIBILITY TO 
KIND OF ADD MORE ABOVE THAT?
BUT

[Captioner] 20:18:00
 OF COURSE WE WANT TO JUST 
STATE ON THE SLIDE THAT WE

[Captioner] 20:18:03
 KNOW 
WE COULD DEFINITELY MEET IN 
SUBMITTING

[Captioner] 20:18:06
 TO THE PROPER HOUSING 
AUTHORITIES TO APPROVE THIS, IS

[Captioner] 20:18:09
 
THAT WHAT MY UNDERSTANDING

[Captioner] 20:18:11
?
>> Planner Pullen:   YES, THIS 
IS -- YES.


[Captioner] 20:18:16
>> Councilmember Cox:   OKAY.
I'M OKAY WITH THAT.
I

[Captioner] 20:18:19
 THINK THAT ANSWERS MY QUESTION 
THERE ON THAT

[Captioner] 20:18:22
.
AND I APPRECIATE THE GREAT 
OUTREACH.


[Captioner] 20:18:25
I MEAN I THINK I SAW ABOUT 25, 
30

[Captioner] 20:18:28
 DIFFERENT SESSIONS WERE HELD 
WITH THE OUTREACH.

[Captioner] 20:18:31

ONE THING THAT IT WASN'T CLEAR 
TO ME WAS, DID WE CHECK

[Captioner] 20:18:35
 WITH THE 
MOBILITY COMMISSION ON THIS

[Captioner] 20:18:38
 
HOUSING ELEMENT?
I DIDN'T SEE THE NAME LISTED,

[Captioner] 20:18:41
 OR 
DID I MISS IT IN READING THE 
NOTES HERE

[Captioner] 20:18:46
?

[Captioner] 20:18:53

>> WE DIDN'T DO A PRESENTATION 
TO THE

[Captioner] 20:18:56
 MOBILITY COMMISSION.
ALTHOUGH WE DID

[Captioner] 20:18:59
 SUBMIT AN 
INFORMATION TO THE BOARD

[Captioner] 20:19:02
 WITH A 
CALL OR THE COMMENTS.
BUT WE

[Captioner] 20:19:06
 DIDN'T SCHEDULE TIMING ON 
THAT PARTICULAR BOARD.


[Captioner] 20:19:16
>> Councilmember Cox:   OKAY, I 
JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE I

[Captioner] 20:19:19
 
CHECKED ON THAT.
THANK YOU FOR THE UPDATE ON 


[Captioner] 20:19:22
THAT.
I'M EXCITED TO SEE THERE ARE 
MANY HOUSING

[Captioner] 20:19:26
 UNITS COMING IN 
ESPECIALLY FOR THE IRVINGTON 
BART STATION

[Captioner] 20:19:29
 THAT WOULD HELP 
PEOPLE TO HAVE HOUSING

[Captioner] 20:19:33
 CLOSE TO 
WHERE THEY COULD GET TO WORK OR 
BE ABLE TO

[Captioner] 20:19:36
 HAVE ACCESS TO 
GETTING OTO OTHER PARTS

[Captioner] 20:19:39
 THAT 
THEY NEED TO GET HERE IN THE 
QUALITY OF LIFE IN FREMONT

[Captioner] 20:19:42
.
SO THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: 

[Captioner] 20:19:45
  THANK YOU, NEXT

[Captioner] 20:19:49
 
IS

[Captioner] 20:19:57
 COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL.


[Captioner] 20:20:02
>> Councilmember Campbell:   
THANK YOU, I HAD A QUESTION 
FREMONT FOR EVERYONE AND THE

[Captioner] 20:20:04
 
CODE ENFORCEMENT PIECE THAT WAS 
TALKED ABOUT EARLIER.


[Captioner] 20:20:07
IS THERE -- I MEAN I KNOW THAT 
WE TALKED

[Captioner] 20:20:11
 ABOUT IT BEING MORE OF 
A

[Captioner] 20:20:14
 STAFFING CONCERN.
IS THERE A

[Captioner] 20:20:17
 WAY THEY COULD 
SCHEDULE QUARTERLY OR

[Captioner] 20:20:21
 MONTHLY 
EXECS WITHOUT THEM BEING RANDOM?
I THINK

[Captioner] 20:20:24
 I SAW SOMEWHERE THAT 
THEY WERE THINKING ABOUT HAVING

[Captioner] 20:20:27
 
RANDOM NONSCHEDULED INSPECTIONS,

[Captioner] 20:20:30
 
OF THE PROPERTY.
IS THAT

[Captioner] 20:20:34
 SOMETHING THAT STAFF 
WOULD CONSIDER INCORPORATE

[Captioner] 20:20:37
ING?

[Captioner] 20:20:40

>> YEAH, I'LL RESPOND TO THAT, 
COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL.


[Captioner] 20:20:47
DAN

[Captioner] 20:20:52
SCHOENHOLZ.
ESSENTIALLY

[Captioner] 20:20:55
, RANDOM INSPECTIONS 
WOULD BE A NEW PROGRAM WE WOULD

[Captioner] 20:20:58
 
NEED TO DEVELOP IN CODE 
ENFORCEMENT AND IT WOULD

[Captioner] 20:21:01
 HAVE 
STAFFING IMPLICATIONS.
AND WHAT WE

[Captioner] 20:21:04
 DON'T WANT TO DO IS 
WE DON'T WANT TO OVER

[Captioner] 20:21:06
PROMISE TO 
THE STATE WHAT WE ARE GOING TO 
DO.


[Captioner] 20:21:09
SO WE DON'T WANT TO INCLUDE

[Captioner] 20:21:12
 THAT 
IN -- YOU KNOW, IN THE

[Captioner] 20:21:15
 HOUSING 
ELEMENT.
IT'S SOMETHING THAT DURING 


[Captioner] 20:21:18
BUDGET TIME, IF THERE ARE

[Captioner] 20:21:22
 CODE 
ENFORCEMENT PROGRAMS THAT WE ARE 
CURRENTLY DOING THAT

[Captioner] 20:21:25
 YOU THINK 
ARE LOWER PRIORITY THAN DOING 
SOME RANDOM

[Captioner] 20:21:28
 INSPECTIONS OF 
APARTMENT BUILDINGS WE COULD 
DISCUSS THAT.

[Captioner] 20:21:32

BUT ESSENTIALLY, YOU KNOW, WE 
HAVE A LIMITED

[Captioner] 20:21:35
 RESOURCE.
WE HAVE A LOT OF DEMANDS ON

[Captioner] 20:21:38
 OUR 
CODE ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS AND IT 
WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO

[Captioner] 20:21:42
 
ACCOMMODATE, YOU KNOW, A NEW 
PROGRAM LIKE THIS

[Captioner] 20:21:45
.
>> Councilmember Campbell:   I 
SEE.


[Captioner] 20:21:48
OKAY.
THANK YOU FOR THAT.
AND THEN MY OTHER QUESTION WAS

[Captioner] 20:21:53
, 
ON PROGRAM NUMBER 32, WHICH

[Captioner] 20:21:56
 WAS 
ALSO A PART OF THE FREMONT FOR

[Captioner] 20:22:00
 
EVERYONE'S MEMORANDUM THAT THEY 
SENT IN

[Captioner] 20:22:04
 CONSIDERING LANGUAGES BE 
OUTSIDE OF JUST

[Captioner] 20:22:07
 REGULAR ADUS TO 
EXPAND OUR ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO

[Captioner] 20:22:10
 
OFFER DIFFERENT TYPES OF HOUSING

[Captioner] 20:22:14
 
ON PROPERTIES SUCH AS THE 
PROVISIONS

[Captioner] 20:22:18
 FOR SB 10 AND SB 9.
IS THAT SOMETHING

[Captioner] 20:22:21
 THAT WE WOULD 
CONSIDER?
BECAUSE I DIDN'T SEE,

[Captioner] 20:22:24
 AND AGAIN 
THERE WAS A LOT OF INFORMATION 
AND I KNOW I'M

[Captioner] 20:22:28
 NEW AND I'M 
TRYING TO CATCH UP, ANY

[Captioner] 20:22:31
 LANGUAGE 
AROUND ANYTHING OTHER THAN SORT

[Captioner] 20:22:34
 
OF THE ADUS.


[Captioner] 20:22:48
SO PROGRAM 32, THE PURPOSE FOR

[Captioner] 20:22:51
 
PROGRAM 32 WAS THE OPPORTUNITIES 
TO EXPAND HOUSING WITHIN THE

[Captioner] 20:22:54
 
HIGHEST

[Captioner] 20:22:58
 RESOURCE NEIGHBORHOODS 
WITHIN THE CITY WHICH ARE THOSE

[Captioner] 20:23:02
 
WHERE TO HAVE ACCESS TO JOBS AND

[Captioner] 20:23:05
 --
>> Councilmember Campbell:   
WAYLAND I DON'T MEAN

[Captioner] 20:23:08
 TO 
INTERRUPT YOU.
I WAS 33.


[Captioner] 20:23:11
DID I SAY 32?
>> I THOUGHT I HEARD 32

[Captioner] 20:23:13
.
BUT --
>> Councilmember Campbell:   I'M 


[Captioner] 20:23:16
SORRY, I MAY HAVE SAID 32 AND I 
HEARD

[Captioner] 20:23:19
 YOU GO DOWN THAT ROAD AND 
I'M LOOKING AT IT NOW

[Captioner] 20:23:22
, I 
APOLOGIZE, IT WAS 33.


[Captioner] 20:23:37
>> AND THE QUESTION WAS WHETHER 
WE ARE CONSIDERING OTHER WAYS

[Captioner] 20:23:40
 TO 
INTENSIFY HIGH RESOURCE SINGLE

[Captioner] 20:23:43
 
FAMILY NEIGHBORHOODS.
>> Councilmember Campbell:   


[Captioner] 20:23:46
OKAY.
>> I THINK WE DID CONSIDER A FEW 
DIFFERENT APPROACHES

[Captioner] 20:23:50
 INCLUDING 
IN ADDITION TO THE -- IN 
ADDITION

[Captioner] 20:23:53
 TO THE ADU PROGRAM

[Captioner] 20:23:57
 
INCLUDING WHICH ALLOWS,

[Captioner] 20:24:00
 GOING TO 
THE STATE LAW WHICH COULD 
POTENTIAL

[Captioner] 20:24:03
LY ALLOW 10 UNITS ON A

[Captioner] 20:24:06
 
SINGLE LOT.
ULTIMATELY BASED ON OUR 


[Captioner] 20:24:09
ANALYSIS, FOCUSING OUR EFFORTS 
ON

[Captioner] 20:24:13
 THIS ADU PROGRAM WAS THE MOST 
REALISTIC AND THE

[Captioner] 20:24:16
 MOST PRACTICAL 
APPROACH TO INTENSIFYING

[Captioner] 20:24:20
 THESE 
NEIGHBORHOODS, GIVEN THE 
DIFFICULTY IN OUR

[Captioner] 20:24:23
 EXPERIENCE IN 
DEVELOPING

[Captioner] 20:24:27
 A MULTIFAMILY LIKE 
TEN

[Captioner] 20:24:31
 UNIT DEVELOPMENT ON A REALLY 
SMALL

[Captioner] 20:24:35
 SITE.
THERE ARE

[Captioner] 20:24:38
 FEW EXAMPLES WHERE -- 
IN THE CITY WHERE WE'VE

[Captioner] 20:24:41
 PRODUCED 
HOUSING AT THAT INTENSITY

[Captioner] 20:24:45
 ON, 
YOU KNOW, ON SMALL LOT SIZES.
SO WE

[Captioner] 20:24:48
 THOUGHT IT WAS MORE 
PRACTICE

[Captioner] 20:24:52
AL IN PROBABLY A MORE

[Captioner] 20:24:55
 
APPROPRIATE RESPONSE TO 
CONCENTRATE ON

[Captioner] 20:24:59
 THE ADU APPROACH.
>> Councilmember Campbell:   I 
SEE, OKAY THANK YOU

[Captioner] 20:25:03
.
>> Planner Pullen:   IF I CAN 
ADD ON TO THAT

[Captioner] 20:25:06
 COUNCILMEMBER 
CAMPBELL, YOU WERE I THINK ON 
THE CORRECT LINKING THOSE

[Captioner] 20:25:09
 TWO 
TOGETHER.
WE DID AN INFORMATIONAL ITEM

[Captioner] 20:25:13
 3 
IN OUR RESPONSE WHICH IS

[Captioner] 20:25:16
 30.3 
TALK ABOUT

[Captioner] 20:25:19
 BOTH PROGRAM 33 AND 
32 IN RESPONSE

[Captioner] 20:25:22
 TO FREMONT FOR 
EVERYONE'S LETTER TOGETHER.
>> Councilmember Campbell:  

[Captioner] 20:25:26
 
OKAY, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
AND THEN MAYOR MEI I

[Captioner] 20:25:29
 KNOW WE 
HAVEN'T GOTTEN THERE YET BUT I'D 
LIKE

[Captioner] 20:25:32
 TO CLARIFY THE MOTION WHEN 
WE GET THERE BECAUSE I'D LIKE TO

[Captioner] 20:25:36
 
HEAR EXACTLY WHAT THE LANGUAGE 
IS THAT

[Captioner] 20:25:39
 WOULD LIKE TO BE ADDED 
PLEASE VERBATIM

[Captioner] 20:25:42
 IF POSSIBLE.
THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:25:46
I KNOW THAT AND EVEN WITH THE 
LANGUAGE IT TALKS ABOUT

[Captioner] 20:25:49
 AND I'LL 
CLARIFY AT THAT TIME, I MEAN 
IT'S MORE VAGUE

[Captioner] 20:25:52
, IT SAYS LABOR 
STANDARDS AND WHO DEFINES

[Captioner] 20:25:55
 THE 
LABOR STANDARDS AROUND

[Captioner] 20:25:58
 WAS GOING 
TO SAY THAT'S IMPORTANT TOO, 
JUST BECAUSE WE ADOPT

[Captioner] 20:26:01
 IT DEPENDS 
ON WHOSE

[Captioner] 20:26:05
 CLARIFICATION IT CAN BE

[Captioner] 20:26:09
 
IDENTIFIED DIFFERENTLY.

[Captioner] 20:26:12

COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN.
>> Councilmember Salwan:   THANK 


[Captioner] 20:26:15
YOU, MAYOR.

[Captioner] 20:26:19

THESE RHNA NUMBERS ARE THEY 
MAXIMUMS

[Captioner] 20:26:22
 OR MINIMUMS?
>> Planner Pullen: 

[Captioner] 20:26:26
  SO 
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN, THE

[Captioner] 20:26:29
 RHNA 
NUMBER THAT GIVES US THE 12,897 
THAT'S

[Captioner] 20:26:32
 THE MINIMUM NUMBER OF 
UNITS THAT WE HAVE TO PROVIDE 
FOR

[Captioner] 20:26:35
 OUR SITES INVENTORY WITHIN 
THE CITY.
AND

[Captioner] 20:26:40
 SO AS DESCRIBED BEFORE,

[Captioner] 20:26:43
 
WE'VE CONSERVATIVELY ESTIMATED 
THE GENERATION OF

[Captioner] 20:26:46
 UNITS 
POTENTIAL ON THOSE SITES PLUS 
PROVIDED A BUFFER.


[Captioner] 20:26:53
>> Councilmember Salwan:   OKAY, 
THANK YOU.
I JUST WANT TO COMMEND STAFF.


[Captioner] 20:26:56
YOU GUYS HAVE REALLY OUTDONE 
YOURSELF

[Captioner] 20:27:00
.
I'VE SEEN A LOT OF HOUSING 
ELEMENTS AND THIS IS A REALLY

[Captioner] 20:27:03
 
FANTASTIC JOB BY EVERYONE.
I APPRECIATE ALL THE OUTREACH 


[Captioner] 20:27:06
AND SEEING YOU GUYS AT THE 
DOWNTOWN EVENTS CENTER AND ALL 
THE

[Captioner] 20:27:10
 FAIRS AND EVERYTHING, SO I 
THINK THIS IS REALLY A GREAT 
HOME

[Captioner] 20:27:13
 RUN AND I LOOK TOWARD TO 
SUPPORTING THIS AND MOVING THIS 
FORWARD

[Captioner] 20:27:15
.
THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:27:18
NEXT IS EXPHOOS.


[Captioner] 20:27:21
 COUNCILMEMBER SHAO

[Captioner] 20:27:25
.
>> Councilmember Shao:   THANK 
YOU, MADAM MAYOR

[Captioner] 20:27:28
.
REGARDING THE PROACTIVE CO-CODE

[Captioner] 20:27:31
 
ENFORCEMENT SINCE I'VE BEEN ON 
THE ALAMEDA COUNTY HOUSING 


[Captioner] 20:27:35
AUTHORITY AND UNDER THE 
AUTHORITY WE HAVE MANY

[Captioner] 20:27:38
 UNITS OF 
SECTION 8

[Captioner] 20:27:43
, APARTMENT UNITS IN 
THE CITY OF FREMONT, TO THE BEST

[Captioner] 20:27:46
 
OF MY KNOWLEDGE FOR ALL THOSE 
SECTION 8 UNITS

[Captioner] 20:27:49
, NOT ONLY THE 
HOUSING AUTHORITY

[Captioner] 20:27:53
 HAS 
ESTABLISHED

[Captioner] 20:27:57
 WELL RECOGNIZED 
SYSTEMS FOR INSPECTIONS

[Captioner] 20:28:01
, 
REGULARLY OR EVEN DURING

[Captioner] 20:28:06
 THE 
LEASE, ALSO THERE'S

[Captioner] 20:28:10
 ALSO WRITTEN 
POLICY AGAINST ANY RETALIATION

[Captioner] 20:28:14
 
FOR SUCH REPORTS OR

[Captioner] 20:28:18
 COMPLAINTS 
MADE BY THE TENANTS.
SO IN OTHER WORDS

[Captioner] 20:28:21
, THIS IS 
INCLUDED IN THE SECTION

[Captioner] 20:28:25
 8 
APARTMENT BUILDING OR

[Captioner] 20:28:28
 UNIT 
PRACTICE BASED ON MY KNOWLEDGE 
AGAIN

[Captioner] 20:28:31
, AND I'LL

[Captioner] 20:28:36
 ACTUALLY YOU 
KNOW THE SECTION 8 APARTMENT

[Captioner] 20:28:39
 
COMPLEXES CALL FOR QUITE A HIGH 
PERCENTAGE OF THE AFFORDABLE 


[Captioner] 20:28:43
HOUSING IN FREMONT.
SO AT LEAST

[Captioner] 20:28:46
 BEFORE WE HAVE 
ENOUGH

[Captioner] 20:28:50
 STAFF AND PROGRAM TO BE 
ESTABLISHED, TO HAVE

[Captioner] 20:28:54
 THE 
PROACTIVE REGULAR OR

[Captioner] 20:28:57
 RANDOM 
INSPECTION, AT

[Captioner] 20:29:00
 LEAST FOR THOSE 
SECTION 8 UNITS,

[Captioner] 20:29:03
 THAT THEY ARE 
WELL COVERED.


[Captioner] 20:29:07
SO THAT'S MY COMMENT.
BUT I HAVE A QUESTION

[Captioner] 20:29:10
.
AGAIN FOR THE PROPOSED

[Captioner] 20:29:14
 LANGUAGE 
BY THE CARPENTER UNION, SO WITH 
THAT

[Captioner] 20:29:17
 LANGUAGE WOULD THAT 
ACTUALLY HAVE SOME BINDING POWER 
TO FORCE

[Captioner] 20:29:20
 EITHER THE CITY OR 
FUTURE HOUSING DEVELOPERS

[Captioner] 20:29:24
 TO 
EXCLUSIVELY HIRE UNION

[Captioner] 20:29:27
 WORKERS 
FOR SUCH CONSTRUCTIONS?
I JUST WANT

[Captioner] 20:29:30
 TO SEE, WHETHER IT 
IS UP TO THE CITY TO HAVE

[Captioner] 20:29:34
 THAT 
KIND OF POLICY,

[Captioner] 20:29:37
 OR WHETHER IT'S 
JUST A MERE RECOMMENDATION

[Captioner] 20:29:42
.

[Captioner] 20:29:45

I HOPE THAT THAT CAN BE 
CLARIFIED BEFORE WE CAN VOTE ON 


[Captioner] 20:29:50
IT.
>> Councilmember Kassan:   MAYBE

[Captioner] 20:29:53
 
YOU CAN GIVE ME THE OPPORTUNITY 
TO READ IT SINCE

[Captioner] 20:29:56
 NOT EVERYONE 
SAW IT AND IT WILL PROBABLY 
BECOME CLEAR THAT IT

[Captioner] 20:30:00
 HAS NO 
BINDING

[Captioner] 20:30:03
 AUTHORITY.
SO I'LL -- IF IT'S OKAY I'M

[Captioner] 20:30:06
 JUST 
GO AHEAD AND READ IT AS PART OF 
THE MOTION I MADE

[Captioner] 20:30:09
.
SO IT SAYS THE ISSUE OF 
AVAILABILITY OF AN

[Captioner] 20:30:12
 ADEQUATE 
CONSTRUCTION WORKFORCE HAS BEEN 
FOUND IN

[Captioner] 20:30:15
 AN ABAG SURVEY OF 
MEMBER JURISDICTIONS TO BE

[Captioner] 20:30:18
 A TOP 
TIER CONSTRAINT FOR BUILDING

[Captioner] 20:30:22
 
ADDITIONAL HOUSING.
AS SUCH, THE CITY

[Captioner] 20:30:25
 SUPPORTS LABOR 
STANDARDS CONDUCIVE

[Captioner] 20:30:28
 TO SUPPLYING 
THE LABOR SUPPLY

[Captioner] 20:30:31
 OF NECESSARY TO 
THE

[Captioner] 20:30:35
 GROWING TIMELY MANNER 
WITHOUT LABOR DISPUTES OR COST

[Captioner] 20:30:38
LY 
DELAYS, THEREBY SUPPORTING THE 
CITY

[Captioner] 20:30:41
'S HOUSING GOALS AND 
OBJECTIVES.
AND OBVIOUSLY STAFF

[Captioner] 20:30:44
 CAN ANSWER 
BUT IT SEEMS FEDERATE CLEAR TO 
ME IT DOESN'T

[Captioner] 20:30:47
 BIND US TO ANY 
TYPE OF COMMITMENTS TO REQUIRING

[Captioner] 20:30:49
 
UNION LABOR OR ANYTHING LIKE 
THAT.


[Captioner] 20:30:56
>> Mayor Mei:   IT WAS ONE OF 
THE ONES ATTACHED IN THE GREEN 
SHEET

[Captioner] 20:31:00
 UNDER HOUSING ELEMENT 
LANGUAGE FOR APPROVAL.
IT'S PAGE

[Captioner] 20:31:03
 3 OF 3.


[Captioner] 20:31:07
BUT I THINK THAT'S THE ONLY 
CLARIFICATION I GUESS, IT

[Captioner] 20:31:10
 SAYS 
LABOR STANDARDS CONDUCIVE AND SO 
I'M

[Captioner] 20:31:14
 JUST CLARIFYING FOR THE 
ATTORNEY, WHAT

[Captioner] 20:31:17
 CLARIFIES EXACTLY 
WHAT THE LABOR STANDARDS.
I

[Captioner] 20:31:20
 GUESS LABOR STANDARDS 
CONDUCIVE MEANING AWHAT

[Captioner] 20:31:23
 EXACTLY, 
THAT SPECIFICATION.


[Captioner] 20:31:29
>> THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION.
I'M GOING TO

[Captioner] 20:31:33
 RECOGNIZE HEATHER 
LEE SENIOR

[Captioner] 20:31:37
 DEPUTY ATTORNEY TO 
ANSWER THE QUESTION.

[Captioner] 20:31:39

>> Mayor Mei:   WELCOME HEATHER.
>> COULD YOU REPEAT THE 


[Captioner] 20:31:43
QUESTION, I THINK THE QUESTION 
IS WHAT STANDARDS WOULD APPLY 
HERE

[Captioner] 20:31:47
.
I'M NOT SURE WHAT STANDARDS 
THEY'RE

[Captioner] 20:31:50
 SPECIFICALLY TALKING 
ABOUT HERE.
I SUSPECT

[Captioner] 20:31:53
 THAT THE IDEA IS THAT 
THERE WOULD BE SOME CONVERSATION

[Captioner] 20:31:56
 
WITH THE UNIONS AN A 
CASE-BY-CASE BASIS

[Captioner] 20:31:59
.
BUT I WOULD ASK ACTUALLY, I 
THINK THEY WOULD NEED

[Captioner] 20:32:03
 TO CLARIFY 
WHAT THEY ARE SPECIFICALLY 
REFERRING TO

[Captioner] 20:32:06
.
>> Mayor Mei:   BECAUSE IT SAYS 
SPECIFICALLY AS SUCH THE

[Captioner] 20:32:10
 CITY 
SUPPORTS LABOR

[Captioner] 20:32:13
 STANDARDS 
CONDUCIVE NECESSARY TO COMPLETE 
THE GROWING NUMBER OF

[Captioner] 20:32:16
 
RESIDENTIAL PRODUCTS FOCUSED BY 
THIS CYCLE'S

[Captioner] 20:32:19
 RHNA AND IN A 
TIMELY MANNER WITHOUT LABOR AND 
THIS IS

[Captioner] 20:32:22
 WHERE THE PART, I'M 
WONDERING, WITHOUT

[Captioner] 20:32:25
 LABOR 
DEPUTIES OR COSTLY DELAYS.
AND I'M NOT

[Captioner] 20:32:28
 SURE IF THAT WOULD 
BE SOMETHING WE'D WANT TO

[Captioner] 20:32:32
 BIND 
OURSELVES TO IN THIS TYPE OF 
FORMAT.


[Captioner] 20:32:35
THIS IS A HOUSING ELEMENT AND 
WE'RE BASICALLY COMMITTING, I'M

[Captioner] 20:32:38
 
NOT SHUSH WHAT THE LABOR 
STANDARDS ARE EXACTLY

[Captioner] 20:32:41
, WE MAY 
NOT AGREE WHAT LAIN STANDARDS 
ARE

[Captioner] 20:32:44
.
WITHOUT LABOR DISPUTES OR COSTLY 
DELAY.


[Captioner] 20:32:47
SINCE WE ARE THE ONES PROVING 
THE

[Captioner] 20:32:50
 ENTITLEMENT OF SUCH 
PROPERTIES BUT NOT THE

[Captioner] 20:32:53
 ONES 
DEVELOPING THE PROPERTY.
THAT WOULD BE UP TO THE 


[Captioner] 20:32:57
CONSTRUCTION PARTY INVOLVED, THE 
DEVELOPER THEMSELVES ALONG WITH 
THE

[Captioner] 20:33:00
 LABOR NOT US AS A CITY.
BECAUSE WE WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO 
BIND

[Captioner] 20:33:03
 ANOTHER THIRD PARTY TO THIS 
TYPE OF AGREEMENT

[Captioner] 20:33:06
.
THAT'S WHY I THINK THE CITY 
PERHAPS CHOSE

[Captioner] 20:33:10
 THE ORIGINAL 
VERBIAGE.
BUT I'LL

[Captioner] 20:33:13
 LEAVE THAT TO YOU 
HEATHER AND TO OUR CITY ATTORNEY

[Captioner] 20:33:15
 
TO CLARIFY.
>> I WOULD SAY AS WRITTEN THAT 


[Captioner] 20:33:19
THE SPECIFIC STANDARDS ARE NOT 
CLEAR.


[Captioner] 20:33:22
AS THEY'VE BEEN PROPOSED.
SO I THINK IT WOULD --

[Captioner] 20:33:25
 IF YOU 
WANT FURTHER CLARIFICATION I 
WOULD THINK WE WOULD WANT TO

[Captioner] 20:33:28
 
HAVE SOMETHING MORE SPECIFICALLY 
SPELLED OUT

[Captioner] 20:33:31
.
AND IF

[Captioner] 20:33:34
 THEY'RE INTERESTED IN 
PROPOSING SOMETHING SPECIFIC BUT 
I AGREE THAT

[Captioner] 20:33:38
 IT'S NOT -- IT'S 
NOT CLEAR IN THE

[Captioner] 20:33:41
 LANGUAGE THAT'S 
PROVIDED.


[Captioner] 20:33:44
>> Mayor Mei:   RIGHT BECAUSE 
IT'S NOT CLARIFYING

[Captioner] 20:33:47
 DEFINITION 
FOR WHAT'S LABOR STANDARDS, 
THAT'S WHY FOR ME

[Captioner] 20:33:50
.
NEXT IS -- IS THAT THE ONLY 
OTHER QUESTIONS YOU

[Captioner] 20:33:54
 HAD 
COUNCILMEMBER SHAO?
>> Councilmember Shao:   YES.


[Captioner] 20:33:57
>> Mayor Mei:   YOUR MIC IS NOT 
ON I'M SORRY.
>> Councilmember Shao:  

[Captioner] 20:34:00
 THANK 
YOU MADAM MAYOR.
THAT'S CORRECT, BUT BASED ON

[Captioner] 20:34:04
 THE 
AMBIGUITY OF THE LANGUAGE

[Captioner] 20:34:07
, 
DIALOGUE AND CONTINUED 
CONVERSATION BETWEEN THE 


[Captioner] 20:34:11
CARPENTERS UNION AND THE CITY 
STAFF.
BUT DUE TO THE

[Captioner] 20:34:14
 FACT THAT THE 
LANGUAGE WAS VAGUE AND ALSO,

[Captioner] 20:34:17
 
THAT THE DEADLINE IS 
APPROACHING, I WOULD MAKE AN

[Captioner] 20:34:20
 
ALTERNATIVE MOTION TO ADOPT THE

[Captioner] 20:34:23
 
HOUSING ELEMENT, AS

[Captioner] 20:34:27
 THE -- 
RECOMMENDED BY THE STAFF.
>> Mayor Mei:  

[Captioner] 20:34:30
 OKAY.
WE HAVE A MOTION.

[Captioner] 20:34:34

>> Councilmember Campbell:   
MADAM MAYOR,

[Captioner] 20:34:38
 POINT OF ORDER.
THE MOTION HAS TO DIE BEFORE 
MAKING

[Captioner] 20:34:42
 A NEW ONE.
BECAUSE IT'S BEEN MOVED AND

[Captioner] 20:34:45
 
SECONDED.
>> Councilmember Kassan:   CAN I 


[Captioner] 20:34:49
ASK FOR CLARIFICATION?
I HEARD

[Captioner] 20:34:52
 ONE MEMBER OF THE STAFF 
SAY THIS DOESN'T BIND US TO 
ANYTHING AND

[Captioner] 20:34:55
 ANOTHER MEMBER OF 
THE STAFF SAY IT'S VAGUE.

[Captioner] 20:34:58

IT'S NATURAL IT WOULD BE VAGUE 
BECAUSE IT IS A STATEMENT

[Captioner] 20:35:01
 OF 
POLICY NOT A STATEMENT OF 
SPECIFIC COMMITMENTS

[Captioner] 20:35:05
.
SO I HEARD SOME STAFF SAY THAT 
THERE WAS NO CONCERN

[Captioner] 20:35:08
 WITH THIS 
LANGUAGE.
SO IF I

[Captioner] 20:35:11
 COULD JUST MAYBE SEE IF 
WE COULD GET A

[Captioner] 20:35:15
 CONSENSUS FROM 
MAYBE THE CITY ATTORNEY

[Captioner] 20:35:18
 ON 
WHETHER THERE IS A CONCERN WITH 
THIS LANGUAGE.


[Captioner] 20:35:21
BECAUSE I'VE HEARD A COUPLE 
DIFFERENT THINGS

[Captioner] 20:35:25
.
>> FROM A LEGAL STANDPOINT I 
DON'T THINK THERE IS

[Captioner] 20:35:28
 ANY PROBLEM 
WITH US ACCEPTING THE LANGUAGE.
BUT IT IS

[Captioner] 20:35:32
 NOT SPECIFIC AS TO 
WHAT STANDARDS WOULD APPLY.
IT IS A STATEMENT

[Captioner] 20:35:36
 OF POLICY.
AND BOTH OF THOSE THINGS ARE 
TRUE

[Captioner] 20:35:39
 BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S 
LEGALLY PROBLEMATIC

[Captioner] 20:35:42
.
>> Mayor Mei:   FROM WHAT I CAN 
SEE I THINK THAT'S CERTAINLY, 


[Captioner] 20:35:45
OUR PLANNING STAFF IS LOOKING AT 
IT FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE AND 
ANGLE

[Captioner] 20:35:49
 AND LENS AND THE LEGAL 
ATTORNEYS ARE LOOKING AT IT

[Captioner] 20:35:52
 
SPECIFICALLY MORE ON THE 
VERBIAGE AND DEPENDING ON THAT I

[Captioner] 20:35:56
 
GUESS THERE ARE AREAS OF 
SPECIALTY I JUST WANT TO MAKE 


[Captioner] 20:35:59
SURE THAT WE ARE NOT SPLITTING 
HAIRS OR PUTTING US

[Captioner] 20:36:02
 INTO A 
SITUATION BECAUSE THE AMBIGUITY 
AND LANGUAGE --

[Captioner] 20:36:05

>> Councilmember Kassan:   I 
THINK WE JUST GOT AN ANSWER ON 


[Captioner] 20:36:08
THAT THAT THERE IS NO LEGAL 
PROBLEM, IT SEEMS

[Captioner] 20:36:13
 THERE IS 
UNANIMITY

[Captioner] 20:36:18
.
>> Mayor Mei:   I WOULD

[Captioner] 20:36:21
 WANT THE 
CITY ATTORNEY TO CLARIFY

[Captioner] 20:36:24
.
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado:   IT IS 
IMPORTANT

[Captioner] 20:36:28
 TO WEIGH IN ON IT, 
THEY MAY WANT TO CLARIFY BUT

[Captioner] 20:36:31
 THE 
COUNCIL COULD MOVE FORWARD WITH 
THE CARPENTERS

[Captioner] 20:36:35
 UNION LANGUAGE IF 
IT IS DESIRABLE TO DO SO.

[Captioner] 20:36:37

>> Mayor Mei:   THAT IS THE 
MOTION ON THE TABLE, THERE ARE 


[Captioner] 20:36:41
OTHER COUNCILMEMBERS WHO ARE 
STILL PENDING SO I DON'T THINK 
THEY'VE HAD

[Captioner] 20:36:44
 AN OPPORTUNITY TO 
SPEAK.
COUNCILMEMBER KENG

[Captioner] 20:36:47
.
>> Vice Mayor Keng:   THANK YOU, 
MADAM MAYOR, I ALSO WANT TO 


[Captioner] 20:36:50
COMMENT THE STAFF DAN WAYLAND, 
JOE AND ALL THE STAFF WORKING

[Captioner] 20:36:54
 ON 
THIS HOUSING ELEMENT YOU GUYS 
HAVE DONE

[Captioner] 20:36:57
 AN OUTSTANDING JOB, 
ESPECIALLY REACHING OUT TO THE

[Captioner] 20:37:00
 
VARIOUS COMMUNITY GROUPS, 
SETTING UP

[Captioner] 20:37:04
 THE OUTREACH AT 
DIFFERENT COMMUNITY EVENTS,

[Captioner] 20:37:07
 AND 
I THINK THOSE ARE ESPECIALLY 
IMPORTANT, ESPECIALLY REACHING

[Captioner] 20:37:10
 
OUT TO OUR LOWER INCOME

[Captioner] 20:37:13
 
RESIDENTS.
AND HOUSING IS ONE

[Captioner] 20:37:17
 OF THE TOP 
ISSUES THAT WE'RE FACING, AND 
HOUSING

[Captioner] 20:37:20
 WILL BE EVEN MORE 
UNAFFORDABLE FOR OUR NEXT 
GENERATION

[Captioner] 20:37:23
.
IT'S ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT TO 
MAKE SURE THAT

[Captioner] 20:37:27
 WE HEAR ALL THE 
VOICES IN OUR COMMUNITY, AND

[Captioner] 20:37:29
 I'M 
READY TO SUPPORT.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:37:32
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.
NEXT, COMN

[Captioner] 20:37:40
 COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN DID 
YOU HAVE ANOTHER COMMENT?
OR IS THAT BEFORE

[Captioner] 20:37:42
?
COUNCILMEMBER SHAO DO YOU HAVE 
ANOTHER COMMENT?


[Captioner] 20:37:45
I HAVE COMMENTS WHEN EVERYONE'S 
DONE.

[Captioner] 20:37:49

>> Councilmember Shao:   NO.
>> Mayor Mei:   COUNCILMEMBER 


[Captioner] 20:37:52
COX DO YOU HAVE ANOTHER COMMENT 
BEFORE I MAKE MINE

[Captioner] 20:37:55
?
>> Councilmember Cox:   IS IT 
ON?


[Captioner] 20:37:58
OKAY.
ONE OF THE THINGS WHEN WE TALK 
ABOUT

[Captioner] 20:38:01
 LABOR STANDARDS, I THINK 
IT'S JUST MAKING SURE

[Captioner] 20:38:04
 THAT THE 
EMPLOYEES, THE WORKERS

[Captioner] 20:38:08
 THAT THEY 
ARE GETTING THE MINIMUM

[Captioner] 20:38:11
 WAGE IN 
COMPLIANCE WITH THE ORDINANCE, 
IS THERE THINGS

[Captioner] 20:38:14
 THAT ARE WRITTEN 
IN THERE THAT HAVE THE

[Captioner] 20:38:17
 OTHER 
LEGAL TERMS THAT FALL IN WITH

[Captioner] 20:38:21
 
FOLLOWING ALL IN COMPLIANCE OF 
ALL FEDERAL,

[Captioner] 20:38:24
 STATE AND LOCAL 
LAWS?
WHEN WE

[Captioner] 20:38:27
 SUBMIT THIS HOUSING 
ELEMENT, I JUST WANTED TO 
CLARIFY

[Captioner] 20:38:30
 THAT.
BECAUSE THERE'S THE FAIR LABOR 
STANDARDS

[Captioner] 20:38:34
 ACT, BUT THERE'S SOME 
OTHER THINGS

[Captioner] 20:38:37
 THAT I JUST WANT TO 
MAKE SURE THE WHOLE SUBMISSION,

[Captioner] 20:38:40
 
WHAT ELSE IS INCLUDED.
IS THERE OTHER TERMS OR 


[Captioner] 20:38:43
CONDITIONS AS WE SUBMIT THIS?

[Captioner] 20:38:52

>> Planner Pullen:   IF I CAN 
ADDRESS THAT FROM THE STAFF SIDE 


[Captioner] 20:38:55
FIRST.
SO I DON'T THINK THERE IS A

[Captioner] 20:38:59
 
DIFFERENCE IN WHICH OF THESE 
LANGUAGE CHOICE

[Captioner] 20:39:02
S HERE, LET THE

[Captioner] 20:39:05
 
COUNCIL DECIDE IN TERMS OF OUR 
LEGAL STANDING

[Captioner] 20:39:08
 WITH THE 
SUFFICIENCY OF OUR DOCUMENT 
GOING TO THE STATE.

[Captioner] 20:39:12

YOU'LL NOTE IN THE ATTACHMENT 
THAT THE CARPENTERS

[Captioner] 20:39:15
 MENTION THAT 
THEY HAVE REVIEWED THE LANGUAGE 
THAT

[Captioner] 20:39:18
 THEY PROPOSED TO SUBSTITUTE 
IN

[Captioner] 20:39:22
 WITH HCD AND HCD HAVE AN 
ISSUE

[Captioner] 20:39:25
 WITH IT.
IF I CAN SORT OF REFRAME THE 
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT WE

[Captioner] 20:39:28
 HAVE 
AND WHAT THEY HAVE, OURS IS

[Captioner] 20:39:32
 
FOCUSED MORE ON ENGAGEMENT OF 
STAFF WITH

[Captioner] 20:39:35
 ALL STAKEHOLDERS 
INCLUDING LABOR AND THIS IS A 
DOCUMENT

[Captioner] 20:39:38
 THAT WE ARE, IS A SORT 
OF A ROAD MAP FOR

[Captioner] 20:39:41
 THE CITY 
MOVING FORWARD AND SO WE FELT 
THAT WAS FRONT

[Captioner] 20:39:44
.
THE ALTERNATE LANGUAGE,

[Captioner] 20:39:47
 WHILE 
AGAIN NOT LEGALLY AN ISSUE,

[Captioner] 20:39:51
 DOES 
FOCUS MORE ON SORT OF

[Captioner] 20:39:54
 THE NUTS 
AND BOLTS

[Captioner] 20:39:57
 OF THE ISSUE ITSELF 
THOUGH IT DOESN'T DEFINE THE

[Captioner] 20:40:01
 
TERMS.


[Captioner] 20:40:06
>> Councilmember Cox:   SO WHEN 
WE SUBMIT THE HOUSING ELEMENT 
PLAN

[Captioner] 20:40:10
 WHAT IS ENTAILED IN IT?
YOU KNOW, I

[Captioner] 20:40:13
 SAW IT HAD THE 
INTRODUCTION DOWN TO THE 
SPECIFIC PROGRAMS, ALL OF

[Captioner] 20:40:16
 THEM 
LISTED, IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE, 
ANY

[Captioner] 20:40:19
 OTHER TYPE BESIDES THAT ONE 
STATEMENT THAT WOULD BE ANY

[Captioner] 20:40:22
 
OTHER LEGAL BINDING TERMS OR 
CONDITIONS?


[Captioner] 20:40:25
THAT'S THE PART THAT I --
>> Planner Pullen:   YES

[Captioner] 20:40:28
.
>> Councilmember Cox:   I DON'T 
SEE THE WHOLE PACKET RIGHT?


[Captioner] 20:40:31
I'M NOT SEEING THE WHOLE PACKET 
SO I DON'T UNDERSTAND, TRYING TO 
PUT

[Captioner] 20:40:34
 THIS WHOLE PACKAGE TOGETHER 
AND WHAT THE LANGUAGE THAT WAS 
PROVIDED

[Captioner] 20:40:37
 BY THE NORTHERN 
CALIFORNIA CARPENTERS

[Captioner] 20:40:41
 UNION 
VERSUS WHAT WE HAVE, I'M JUST 
TRYING TO UNDERSTAND AS

[Captioner] 20:40:45
 WE 
RESEMBLE

[Captioner] 20:40:48
.
>> THE

[Captioner] 20:41:03
 
ASSEMBLE THE PACKET?
>> Planner Pullen:  

[Captioner] 20:41:06
 COMMENT 43, 
IT DOES TALK ABOUT WORKING WITH 
ALL THE

[Captioner] 20:41:10
 STAKEHOLDERS INVOLVED 
AND PRODUCTION OF HOUSING

[Captioner] 20:41:14
 
INVOLVES A MULTITOOUTD OF COST.
LABOR IS ONE OF

[Captioner] 20:41:18
 THOSE COSTS, YOU 
KNOW THE SUPPLIES TO DO THE 
CONSTRUCTION

[Captioner] 20:41:21
.
FEES, LAND, ALL THOSE

[Captioner] 20:41:24
 THINGS 
COME TOGETHER.
AND IF ANY ONE OF THOSE THINGS 


[Captioner] 20:41:27
IS TOO HIGH THE PROJECT HAS 
DIFFICULTY MOVING FORWARD, AND

[Captioner] 20:41:30
 
SO STAFF RECOGNIZES THE 
MULTIFACET

[Captioner] 20:41:35
ED, YOU KNOW, 
CHALLENGE THAT DEVELOPMENT

[Captioner] 20:41:38
 OF 
BOTH MARKET RATE AND AFFORDABLE 
HOUSING HAS.

[Captioner] 20:41:41

AND SO WE FOCUSED ON THE NEED TO 
INVOLVE

[Captioner] 20:41:44
 ALL STAKEHOLDERS WHICH 
DOES INCLUDE LABOR.
THAT'S AN IMPORTANT

[Captioner] 20:41:47
 PART OF IT.
PROGRAM 42 IS

[Captioner] 20:41:51
 THE MOST DIRECT 
REFLECTION OF THAT

[Captioner] 20:41:55
 DISCUSSION 
THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN.


[Captioner] 20:42:03
>> Councilmember Cox:   OKAY.
I GUESS I'M STILL MISSING A 
PIECE

[Captioner] 20:42:06
 THAT WE JUST ADD THAT 
LANGUAGE IN TO COVER THIS

[Captioner] 20:42:09
 
SPECIFIC PART.
BUT IS THERE ANY OTHER TERMS OR

[Captioner] 20:42:12
 
CONDITIONS RELATING TO ANY OTHER 
FEDERAL STATE

[Captioner] 20:42:15
 OR LOCAL LAWS THAT 
WE HAVE TO STATE IN

[Captioner] 20:42:19
 THIS 
PROPOSAL?

[Captioner] 20:42:29

>> Planner Pullen:   THAT'S A 
BROAD AREA.


[Captioner] 20:42:32
IN TERMS OF THE DEVELOPER'S NEED 
TO COMPLY WITH THOSE OR

[Captioner] 20:42:35
 IN TERMS 
OF OUR NEED TO RESPOND TO STATE 
HOUSING ELEMENT

[Captioner] 20:42:38
 LAW, WHICH IS, 
IF YOU LOOK

[Captioner] 20:42:42
 AT THE RESOLUTION, 
THERE IS A MULTITUDE OF

[Captioner] 20:42:45
 STATE 
LAWS THAT WE ARE CHECKING

[Captioner] 20:42:48
 BOXES 
ALONG THE WAY IN THIS DOCUMENT.
MOST OF

[Captioner] 20:42:51
 THOSE ARE STATE LAWS.
AND THEY ARE

[Captioner] 20:42:55
 VERY NOOUMENT RUSS 
AND WE'VE GONE TO GREAT PAINS TO 
ACCOMMODATE THOSE.

[Captioner] 20:42:58

IN TERMS OF FEDERAL AND OTHER 
LAWS, YOU KNOW,

[Captioner] 20:43:01
 THIS IS REALLY A 
STATE AFFAIR DEFINITIVE

[Captioner] 20:43:04
 BY THEIR 
REQUIREMENTS ON LOCAL 
DEVELOPMENT.


[Captioner] 20:43:07
SO THAT IS

[Captioner] 20:43:10
 WHERE THE ISSUES ARE

[Captioner] 20:43:14
.
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado:   IF I 
MAY

[Captioner] 20:43:17
 COUNCILMEMBER COX, THE 
REPORT ITSELF

[Captioner] 20:43:21
 SATISFIES LEGAL 
REQUIREMENTS, AND ON A PROJECT 
BY

[Captioner] 20:43:24
 PROJECT BASIS DEVELOPERS WILL 
HAVE TO COMPLY WITH STATE LAW

[Captioner] 20:43:27
 
WITH RESPECT TO WHATEVER TYPE OF 
ISSUE THEY'RE REVIEWING

[Captioner] 20:43:31
 OAT THE 
MOMENT WHETHER IT'S FAIR LABOR 
STANDARDS

[Captioner] 20:43:34
 OR SPECIFIC LAWS OR A 
CITY'S MUNICIPAL CODE BUT

[Captioner] 20:43:37
 THIS 
DOCUMENT ITSELF IS REALLY 
INTENDED TO MEET THE

[Captioner] 20:43:41
 MINIMUM 
REQUIREMENTS OF STATE LAW WITH 
RESPECT TO THE HOUSING ELEMENT 


[Captioner] 20:43:44
AND IT DOES THAT.
>> Councilmember Cox:   OKAY AND 
THEN IT COVERS THAT OTHER PIECE

[Captioner] 20:43:47
.
OKAY, THANK YOU, YOU ANSWERED MY 
QUESTION.


[Captioner] 20:43:50
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU, 
COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL DID YOU 
HAVE

[Captioner] 20:43:53
 ANOTHER CLARIFYING QUESTION 
OR STATEMENT

[Captioner] 20:43:56
?
>> Councilmember Campbell:   I 
THINK I ANSWERED MY OWN 


[Captioner] 20:43:59
QUESTION, AS I LOOK THROUGH HERE 
TO SEE THE DIFFERENCE IN OUR

[Captioner] 20:44:03
 
LANGUAGE VERSUS WHAT THE 
CARPENTERS UNION HAD PROPOSED

[Captioner] 20:44:07
.
THERE'S NOT MUCH DIFFERENCE IN 
THAT.


[Captioner] 20:44:10
BUT THEN WHEN I LOOKED AT THE 
ACTUAL PROGRAM

[Captioner] 20:44:13
 42, IT DIDN'T 
HAVE ANY -- IT DIDN'T

[Captioner] 20:44:16
 SAY 
SPECIFICALLY THAT WE WOULD 
CONSULT WITH LABOR.


[Captioner] 20:44:19
SO I THINK THAT'S WHAT THEY WERE 
TRYING TO BE ABLE TO

[Captioner] 20:44:23
 --
>> Mayor Mei:   I THINK IT SAYS 
WE CONSULT WITH ALL PARTIES

[Captioner] 20:44:26
 
WHICH INCLUDES LABOR BUT --
>> Councilmember Campbell:   BUT 


[Captioner] 20:44:30
THAT'S THEORETICALLY IT COULD.
ALL PARTIES DON'T NECESSARILY 
MEAN THAT

[Captioner] 20:44:33
 IT'S GOING TO BE 
LABOR.
SO IF YOU SAID IT SPECIFICALLY

[Captioner] 20:44:36
 
THE WAY THEY'VE DRAWN IT OUT 
HERE, IT WOULD BE

[Captioner] 20:44:39
 -- IT WOULD BE 
MORE CONCRETE IN THAT WE

[Captioner] 20:44:43
 ARE -- 
WE ARE DEFINITELY GOING TO HAVE 
LABOR

[Captioner] 20:44:46
 AT THE TABLE.
>> Mayor Mei:   WELL, I'D WANT 
TO

[Captioner] 20:44:49
 HAVE EVERYTHING AT THE TABLE, 
I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE

[Captioner] 20:44:52
 
WITHOUT SOME OF THESE -- IT IS A 
MULTIPRONGED

[Captioner] 20:44:56
, MULTILEG ID TABLE, 
IF WE DON'T GET IT

[Captioner] 20:44:59
 BALANCED IT 
WON'T BE BUILT ANYWAYS

[Captioner] 20:45:02
.
>> Councilmember Campbell:   
THAT'S NOT THE QUESTION BEFORE 


[Captioner] 20:45:05
US NOW.
THE QUESTION IS IF WE ADD IN THE 
LANGUAGE THAT INCLUDES THE

[Captioner] 20:45:07
 
PROVISIONS ABOUT LABOR IN THE 
CONVERSATION.


[Captioner] 20:45:10
IF WE WANT TO ADD SOMETHING ELSE 
THEN WE HAVE TO

[Captioner] 20:45:13
 LET THIS MOTION 
DIE, AND THEN BRING IN ANOTHER 
MOTION

[Captioner] 20:45:15
.
>> Mayor Mei:   YES, THAT'S 
FINE.


[Captioner] 20:45:18
>> Councilmember Campbell:   
OKAY, THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei:  

[Captioner] 20:45:21
 COUNCILMEMBER 
SALWAN DID YOU HAVE OTHER 
COMMENTS?


[Captioner] 20:45:24
>> Councilmember Salwan:   JUST 
TO CLARIFY, I WANT TO RECAP SO 
WE'RE NOT SPLITTING

[Captioner] 20:45:27
 HAIRS.
BASICALLY

[Captioner] 20:45:32
 BOTH STATEMENTS ARE 
STATEMENTS OF INTENTION WHAT 
WE'RE TRYING TO DO TO INCLUDE

[Captioner] 20:45:35
 
LABOR, MAKE SURE WE ENGAGE THEM 
AND HAVE THEM AS WILLING

[Captioner] 20:45:38
 
STAKEHOLDERS.
THERE IS NO LEGAL BINDING

[Captioner] 20:45:41
 ASPECT 
OF ANY OF THIS IS THAT CORRECT?
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: 

[Captioner] 20:45:44
  IT 
ESSENTIALLY INDICATES THE CITY'S 
SUPPORT OF

[Captioner] 20:45:47
 INCLUDING LABOR IN 
THESE AND STAKEHOLDERS IN

[Captioner] 20:45:50
 THESE 
DISCUSSIONS.
EITHER OF THEM MEET THE MINIMUM 


[Captioner] 20:45:54
STANDARD.
>> Councilmember Salwan:   OKAY, 
EITHER WAY WE'RE GOING TO

[Captioner] 20:45:56
 GET 
APPROVED.
OKAY.


[Captioner] 20:45:59
ALL RIGHT.
>> Mayor Mei:   SO AT THIS TIME 
I'LL MAKE MY COMMENTS.


[Captioner] 20:46:02
SO FREMONT IS ONE OF THE FEW 
HANDFUL OF CITIES THAT

[Captioner] 20:46:05
 MET OUR 
RHNA NUMBERS FOR THE

[Captioner] 20:46:08
 2015 TO 
2023 CYCLE.
I WANTED TO LET

[Captioner] 20:46:12
 THE PUBLIC KNOW 
THAT I'M VERY FAMILIAR WITH THIS 
BECAUSE I

[Captioner] 20:46:15
 ACTUALLY PARTICIPATED 
IN THE ABAG MTC DISCUSSIONS

[Captioner] 20:46:18
 THAT 
CAME ABOUT WITH THESE NUMBERS 
AND REPRESENT US ALONG

[Captioner] 20:46:21
 WITH 
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN ON ABAG, 
AND HAVE

[Captioner] 20:46:24
 BEEN PARTICIPATING IN 
THIS CONVERSATION.
BECAUSE

[Captioner] 20:46:28
 PLAN BAY AREA 2050 IS 
ONE THAT SPANNED

[Captioner] 20:46:31
 OVER MANY 
DIFFERENT YEARS.
SO BUILDING HOUSING AND 


[Captioner] 20:46:34
DETERMINING LAND USE IS A 
FOUNDATIONAL ROLE FOR US AS 
COUNCIL AND TO

[Captioner] 20:46:37
 HAVE THE 
OVERSIGHT OF THE RESPONSIBILITY 
OF OUR LOCAL

[Captioner] 20:46:41
 CITIES GOVERNANCE 
IN BUILDING FOR COMMUNITIES.
AND IT IS IMPORTANT AND 


[Captioner] 20:46:44
THOUGHTFUL FOR US AND THAT'S WHY 
WE WANTED TO GO THROUGH

[Captioner] 20:46:47
 THIS 
DETAILED ANALYSIS IN GETTING THE 
PAIRING WHICH IS IMPORTANT.

[Captioner] 20:46:50

I THINK MANY TIMES THIS IS ONE 
PIECE OF IT AND THE PUBLIC DOES 


[Captioner] 20:46:53
NOT ALWAYS SEE THAT THE NUMBERS 
HAVE DOUBLED.
AND WHEN WE

[Captioner] 20:46:56
 TALK ABOUT HOUSING, 
THE AMOUNT OF INCREASE THE LAST 
COUPLE OF YEARS

[Captioner] 20:47:00
.
I ALSO WANTED TO LET THE PUBLIC 
KNOW THAT IT'S

[Captioner] 20:47:03
 ALSO IMPORTANT 
FOR US WHEN WE LOOKED ABOUT AND 
WE TALKED ABOUT

[Captioner] 20:47:06
 PLANNED AREA 
DEVELOPMENTS THAT WE LOOKED AT 
TALKING

[Captioner] 20:47:09
 TO THE CONSTITUENTS 
BECAUSE MANY PEOPLE QUESTIONED 
AND YOU'VE HEARD SOME

[Captioner] 20:47:12
 OF THE 
SPEAKERS THIS EVENING TALK ABOUT 
THE AFFORDABILITY OF THE HOUSING

[Captioner] 20:47:15

HOUSING, ABOUT THE FACT THAT 
THERE'S QUESTIONS ABOUT THE 


[Captioner] 20:47:18
IMPACT ON INFRASTRUCTURE, AND 
INFRASTRUCTURE MEANING

[Captioner] 20:47:22
 THE 
UTILITIES, OUR PUBLIC SERVICES 
AS WELL AS

[Captioner] 20:47:25
 OUR, YOU KNOW, 
SCHOOLS AND OTHER PIECES.
WHILE THOSE ARE

[Captioner] 20:47:28
 NOT 
DETERMINATION FACTORS THEY ARE 
ONES THAT WE WANT TO HAVE 


[Captioner] 20:47:31
BALANCE WHEN WE LOOK AT THIS.
AND SO THE GENERAL PLAN WHICH WE 
REFERENCE

[Captioner] 20:47:35
ED TONIGHT WAS APPROVED 
IN 2011 AND HAS

[Captioner] 20:47:38
 BEEN UPDATED 
THROUGH THESE HOUSING ELEMENTS.
I ALSO

[Captioner] 20:47:41
 TOO WANT TO THANK OUR 
STAFF AND THOSE WHO HAVE 
REVIEWED IT

[Captioner] 20:47:44
.
SO FAR IN THE COUNTY OF ALAMEDA, 
THE

[Captioner] 20:47:48
 ONLY HOUSING ELEMENT THAT 
HAS BEEN ACCEPTED HAS

[Captioner] 20:47:51
 BEEN 
ALAMEDA, THE CITY OF ALAMEDA.
AND I'VE

[Captioner] 20:47:54
 REVIEWED THEIRS PLUS 
OURS TOO.
SO I MEAN IT IS

[Captioner] 20:47:58
 A LENGTHY 
DOCUMENT AND I THANK ALL OF YOU,

[Captioner] 20:48:01
 
IT'S ABOUT 530 SOME PAGES SO IT 
IS VERY DETAILED.


[Captioner] 20:48:04
AND I THINK THAT WHIT COMES TO 
THIS CONVERSATION,

[Captioner] 20:48:07
 OF HOUSING 
AND APPROVALS I

[Captioner] 20:48:10
 DEFINITELY AM 
SUPPORTIVE OF LABOR AND MAKING 
SURE THAT WE HAVE

[Captioner] 20:48:14
 THE CONDUCIVE 
PROGRAMS WHICH IS WHY WE

[Captioner] 20:48:18
 HAVE 
PARTNERED WITH THE MISSION

[Captioner] 20:48:21
 
VALLEY ROP AND OTHER PROGRAMS, 
TO MAKE

[Captioner] 20:48:24
 SURE WE'RE COMPLIANT 
WITH THE PROGRAMS, NOT

[Captioner] 20:48:27
 IN JUST 
BUDGET ALONE IN TERMS OF 
PRIORITIZING

[Captioner] 20:48:30
 THAT WHEN IT COMES 
TO APPLYING THAT BUT IN TERMS OF 
THE

[Captioner] 20:48:33
 ABILITY TO RECRUIT AND FIND 
THE STAFFING.
BECAUSE WHEN YOU LOOK THROUGHOUT

[Captioner] 20:48:36
 
THE BAY AREA IT IS NOT JUST 
FREMONT BUT SAN JOSE AND

[Captioner] 20:48:40
 MANY 
OTHER CITIES.
AND WHEN I TALK

[Captioner] 20:48:43
 WITH MY FELLOW 
MUNICIPALITIES MANY STRUGGLE IN 
FIND

[Captioner] 20:48:46
ING THE WORKFORCE.
AS OUR PLANNING STAFF HAS 
MENTIONED THIS

[Captioner] 20:48:50
 EVENING OOFN 
LABOR IS ONE PIECE OF IT

[Captioner] 20:48:53
 AS WELL 
AS MATERIALS AND SUPPLY.
WHEN IT COMES TO BUILDING THE 


[Captioner] 20:48:57
HOUSING AND WE ARE VERY 
FORTUNATE LAST TIME TO HAVE

[Captioner] 20:49:01
 
PLANNED DEVELOPMENTS AND PARTLY 
OF THE FACTORING IN

[Captioner] 20:49:04
 TERMS OF THE 
NUMBERS WE HAVE SET IS

[Captioner] 20:49:07
 OUR 
TRANSIT ORIENTED DEVELOPMENT AND

[Captioner] 20:49:10
 
OPPORTUNITIES AS WELL AS THE 
FACT THAT WE HAVE A VERY

[Captioner] 20:49:13
 
CONDUCIVE NEIGHBORHOOD AND 
COMMUNITIES WHICH SUPPORT 


[Captioner] 20:49:16
ENSURING THAT PEOPLE HAVE 
ACCESS.
SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE

[Captioner] 20:49:19
 THAT 
WHEN WE APPROVE THESE THINGS 
THAT WE DON'T

[Captioner] 20:49:22
 LIMIT OURSELVES IN 
TERMS OF OPPORTUNITIES TO

[Captioner] 20:49:26
 ENSURE 
BALANCE.
BECAUSE BY FAR

[Captioner] 20:49:29
 WHEN YOU LOOK AT 
THE HOUSING THAT WE HAVE BEEN 
ABLE TO

[Captioner] 20:49:32
 BUILD AND IT INCLUDES 
THE NEED FOR MARKET RATE HOUSING

[Captioner] 20:49:35
 
BECAUSE THAT'S HOW WE HAVE BEEN 
ABLE TO TAKE OUR

[Captioner] 20:49:38
 IN LIEU FEES TO 
BE ABLE TO CREATE SOME OF THE 
TARGETED AND

[Captioner] 20:49:41
 LARGER SCAILT 
PROPERTIES THAT ARE OR THE 
AFFORDABLE HOUSING, I KNOW 


[Captioner] 20:49:44
PEOPLE HAVE TALKED ABOUT IN THE 
PAST NOT JUST THE HOUSING UNITS 
BUT ABOUT

[Captioner] 20:49:47
 THE WRAP AROUND 
SERVICES AND THOSE ARE SOMETIMES 
EASY

[Captioner] 20:49:51
IER APPLIED IN A MORE 
CONDUCIVE

[Captioner] 20:49:54
 AND LOGICAL OFFERING 
WHETHER

[Captioner] 20:49:58
 THAN ONESIES TWOSI

[Captioner] 20:50:01
ES AS 
PART OF THE DEVELOPMENT.
I WANT TO

[Captioner] 20:50:04
 FOREWARN THE PEOPLE 
THAT WE AS A CITY CAN

[Captioner] 20:50:08
 APPROVE 
THESE HOUSING ELEMENTS, WE'RE 
GIVING OURSELVES

[Captioner] 20:50:11
 A LITTLE BIT OF 
A BUFFER.
I LIKE THE

[Captioner] 20:50:14
 ADUS BEING INCLUDED, 
IF YOU LOOK AT THE

[Captioner] 20:50:18
 LAST NUMBER 
OF RHNA NUMBERS

[Captioner] 20:50:21
 WE ACTUALLY 
EXCEEDED THE NUMBERS.
BUT WHEN YOU EXCEED THE

[Captioner] 20:50:24
 NUMBERS 
IT DOESN'T CARRY OVER TO THE 
NEXT ROUND

[Captioner] 20:50:27
 OF RHNA, IT'S 
IMPORTANT TO BUILD THE BALANCE

[Captioner] 20:50:31
, 
WE TALKED LIKE I SAID THIS 
EVENING ABOUT

[Captioner] 20:50:34
 INFRASTRUCTURE 
CONSTRAINTS AND LIMITATIONS 
WHICH ARE UTILITIES AND

[Captioner] 20:50:37
 WE ARE 
LOOKING AT SOME OF THAT EVEN 
RIGHT NOW

[Captioner] 20:50:40
 AS WE MOVE FORWARD IN 
ENERGY AND THE FACT HAD A WE 
WANT TO

[Captioner] 20:50:43
 HAVE ELECTRIFICATION, 
AND WE ARE LOOK

[Captioner] 20:50:46
ING FORWARD AS A 
CITY TO BUILD THESE CLEAN AND 
GREEN

[Captioner] 20:50:50
 ENVIRONMENTAL POLICIES 
INTO

[Captioner] 20:50:53
 OUR HOUSING.
BUT EACH OF THESE HAVE 
LIMITATIONS

[Captioner] 20:50:56
 ON LABOR AND COST.
AT THIS TIME I JUST WANTED TO 
SEE, I

[Captioner] 20:51:00
 KNOW WE'VE TALKED ABOUT 
THIS IN TERMS OF MOVING FORWARD, 
BUT I WANTED

[Captioner] 20:51:03
 TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE 
THOUGHT ABOUT ALL THE PROCESSES.


[Captioner] 20:51:06
FOR MY AREA OF CONCERN IT'S NOT 
THAT

[Captioner] 20:51:09
 I DON'T SUPPORT LABOR BUT 
I'M CURIOUS ABOUT LABOR

[Captioner] 20:51:11
 
STANDARDS.
IT SAYS SPECIFICALLY WE WOULDN'T 


[Captioner] 20:51:15
IMPEDE IT BASED OFF OF COST AND 
LABOR DEPUTIES

[Captioner] 20:51:18
 DISPUTES.
I WANTED TO CLARIFY WITH STAFF 
DOES THAT BIND

[Captioner] 20:51:21
 US TO ANYTHING?
BECAUSE IN TERMS OF THE 
AMBIGUITY

[Captioner] 20:51:24
 AS TO WHAT IS A LABOR 
DISPUTE

[Captioner] 20:51:28
?

[Captioner] 20:51:34



[Captioner] 20:51:37
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado:  , IT 
IS A STATEMENT OF POLICY, TO 
MOVE FORWARD

[Captioner] 20:51:40
 HOUSING IN AN 
EXPEDITIOUS MANNER

[Captioner] 20:51:44
, BUT IT 
DOESN'T SET FORTH A SPECIFIC 
DEADLINE THAT WE

[Captioner] 20:51:48
 WOULD COMPLY.
>> Mayor Mei:   IT DOESN'T HAVE 
A SHOT

[Captioner] 20:51:51
 CLOCK?
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado:   
CORRECT.


[Captioner] 20:51:54
>> Councilmember Cox:   I WOULD 
JUST LIKE TO REMIND YOU THAT WE 
WERE

[Captioner] 20:51:57
 SUPPOSED TO

[Captioner] 20:52:03
 STOP AT 8:30.

[Captioner] 20:52:05

>> Mayor Mei:   WE WANTED TO 
FINISH THIS ITEM.


[Captioner] 20:52:08
I WANTED TO SEE IF WE WOULD TAKE

[Captioner] 20:52:10
 
A VOTE.
>> Councilmember Cox:   LET'S 


[Captioner] 20:52:13
REFRESH WHAT WE ARE VOTING ON, 
JUST TO BE SURE

[Captioner] 20:52:15
 IT'S ALL CLEAR 
WITH EVERYONE.
PLEASE.


[Captioner] 20:52:18
>> Councilmember Campbell:   DOES 
THAT MOTION MEDIUM

[Captioner] 20:52:21
 WHINE WE'RE 
REFRESHING ON IT THAT WE WOULD 
REPLACE

[Captioner] 20:52:25
 THE LANGUAGE ALTOGETHER 
AT PROGRAM

[Captioner] 20:52:28
 42 AT THIS 
INTRODUCTORY CLAUSE?
IS THAT WHAT

[Captioner] 20:52:31
 WE'RE SUGGESTING?
>> Councilmember Kassan:   WHAT 
I'M

[Captioner] 20:52:35
 PROPOSE -- IF YOU LOOK AT 
THE

[Captioner] 20:52:39
 ITEM STAFF IS STATED STATED 
JANUARY

[Captioner] 20:52:42
 10th FROM DAN

[Captioner] 20:52:46
 
SCHOENHOLZ, THEY HAVE LANGUAGE 
IN THERE THAT THEY'RE PROPOSING 


[Captioner] 20:52:49
AS A REPLACEMENT TO WHAT WHEREAS 
PROPOSED BY THE CARPENTERS UNION

[Captioner] 20:52:52
 
AND I'M JUST SUGGESTING THAT 
INSTEAD OF THE

[Captioner] 20:52:56
 REPLACEMENT 
PARAGRAPH THAT STAFF HAD 
PROPOSED ON PAGE 1 THAT WE

[Captioner] 20:52:59
 
INSTEAD INCLUDE THE PARAGRAPH 
THAT WAS PROPOSED BY LABOR

[Captioner] 20:53:02
.
VERY FEW PEOPLE TOOK THE TIME TO 
MAKE ANY

[Captioner] 20:53:05
 COMMENTS ON THE PLAN, 
AND

[Captioner] 20:53:09
 THIS DOESN'T HAVE ANY LEG 
RAMIFICATIONS.
I THINK THERE'S

[Captioner] 20:53:12
 NO REASON NOT TO 
HONOR THE FACT THAT THEY TOOK 
THE TIME TO

[Captioner] 20:53:15
 MAKE THIS 
SUGGESTION, AND STAFF IS FINE 
WITH IT

[Captioner] 20:53:18
.
SO I HOPE WE CAN GO AHEAD AND 
JUST -- IT'S SUCH

[Captioner] 20:53:22
 A MINOR CHANGE 
I THINK, YOU KNOW, WE'RE TALKING

[Captioner] 20:53:25
 
ABOUT .01% OF THE TOTAL 
DOCUMENT.


[Captioner] 20:53:28
I THINK WE CAN JUST GO AHEAD AND 
DO IT

[Captioner] 20:53:30
.
>> Councilmember Cox:   CAN YOU 
REREAD IT AGAIN, THE WHOLE 


[Captioner] 20:53:34
MOTION.
>> Councilmember Kassan:   SO 
THE MOTION IS TO ACCEPT STAFF

[Captioner] 20:53:37
'S 
RECOMMENDATION WITH THE ONE 
CHANGE THAT INSTEAD OF

[Captioner] 20:53:40
 THE 
PARAGRAPH THAT'S ON PAGE

[Captioner] 20:53:43
 1 OF 
THE MEMO FROM JANUARY 10th, 
FROM

[Captioner] 20:53:46
 DAN, THAT WE INCLUDE THE

[Captioner] 20:53:50
 
PARAGRAPH AND IF YOU WANT ME TO 
READ IT AGAIN I CAN

[Captioner] 20:53:53
.
BUT WE INCLUDE THE PARAGRAPH 
SUBMITTED BY

[Captioner] 20:53:57
 THE NORTHERN 
CALIFORNIA CARPENTERS UNION

[Captioner] 20:54:00
.
>> Mayor Mei:   IT'S ON PAGE 3 
OF THE GREEN SHEET

[Captioner] 20:54:03
 OR THE 
ATTACHMENT NUMBER --
>> Councilmember Kassan:   IT IS

[Captioner] 20:54:07
 
AN E-MAIL FROM HARVEY McKEON

[Captioner] 20:54:11
.
>> Councilmember Cox:   I HAVE 
IT BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE WE 


[Captioner] 20:54:14
READ IT IN THE ENTIRETY OF THE 
MOTION.
>> Councilmember Kassan:   TO 


[Captioner] 20:54:17
SAY IT ONE MORE TIME ACCEPT 
STAFF'S RECOMMENDATION WITH

[Captioner] 20:54:20
 JUST 
THE ONE CHANGE TO ADD THE 
PARAGRAPH SUBMITTED BY

[Captioner] 20:54:23
 THE 
CARPENTERS UNION INSTEAD OF THE 
PARAGRAPH

[Captioner] 20:54:27
 PROPOSED ON PAGE 1 OF 
THE GREEN SHEET THAT

[Captioner] 20:54:29
 WAS 
PROPOSED BY STAFF.
>> Councilmember Campbell:   


[Captioner] 20:54:33
REPLACING WHAT'S IN THE DRAFT 
ELEMENT RIGHT NOW?
>> Councilmember Kassan:   NO

[Captioner] 20:54:36
, 
REPLACING THE LANGUAGE ON PAGE 1 
OF THE GREEN

[Captioner] 20:54:39
 SHEET.
>> Councilmember Campbell:   BUT 
THAT'S

[Captioner] 20:54:42
 STILL CONFUSING TO ME, 
I'M SORRY I'M NOT GETTING IT.


[Captioner] 20:54:45
BECAUSE THERE IS ALREADY 
LANGUAGE IN THE DRAFT ELEMENT

[Captioner] 20:54:47
.
>> Councilmember Kassan:   SO 
THE PROPOSED LANGUAGE BY STAFF 


[Captioner] 20:54:50
SAYS THE AVAILABILITY OF AN 
ADEQUATE CONSTRUCTION WORKFORCE 
IS

[Captioner] 20:54:54
 NECESSARY TO BUILD -- IF 
THAT'S THE

[Captioner] 20:54:57
 RIGHT ONE --
>> Mayor Mei:   IT IS THE 
AVAILABILITY OF

[Captioner] 20:55:00
 AN ADEQUATE --
>> Councilmember Kassan:   SORRY 
THAT WAS RIGHT OKAY.

[Captioner] 20:55:02

STAFF RECOMMENDS THIS LANGUAGE.
THE AVAILABILITY OF AN ADEQUATE 


[Captioner] 20:55:06
CONSTRUCTION WORKFORCE IS 
NECESSARY TO BUILD THE NUMEROUS 
RESIDENTIAL

[Captioner] 20:55:09
 DEVELOPMENTS NEEDED 
TO MEET THE REGION'S HOUSING 
GENOMES.


[Captioner] 20:55:12
PROGRAM 42 OF THE HOUSING 
ELEMENT COMMITS THE CITY

[Captioner] 20:55:16
 TO 
CONSULTING WITH STAKEHOLDERS 
INCLUDING REPRESENTATIVES

[Captioner] 20:55:19
 FROM 
THE RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION 
INDUSTRY ON HOUSING POLICY 


[Captioner] 20:55:22
CHANGES.
THIS PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR 
DISCUSSION AND CONSIDERATION

[Captioner] 20:55:26
 OF 
POTENTIAL IMPACTS TO THE SUPPLY 
OF

[Captioner] 20:55:29
 CONSTRUCTION LABOR WHEN 
ADOPTING HOUSING POLICY CHANGES.


[Captioner] 20:55:32
I'M PROPOSING STRIKING OUT THAT 
LANGUAGE ONLY,

[Captioner] 20:55:35
 NO OTHER CHANGES, 
AND REPLACING IT

[Captioner] 20:55:39
 WITH THE 
LANGUAGE THAT I READ EARLIER 
THAT WAS SUBMITTED BY THE

[Captioner] 20:55:41
 --
>> Councilmember Campbell:   I 
GET THAT, I HEAR THAT, I THINK I 


[Captioner] 20:55:45
HEARD THAT ABOUT TEN TIMES NOW.
THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M ASKING.

[Captioner] 20:55:48

THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M ASKING.
THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M ASKING.

[Captioner] 20:55:51

I'M ASKING YOU TO TAKE A LOOK AT 
PAGE 2.22

[Captioner] 20:55:54
, WHICH IS PROGRAM 42,

[Captioner] 20:55:59
 
THAT IS -- THAT WAS MENTION

[Captioner] 20:56:02
ED IN  
STAFF'S

[Captioner] 20:56:05
 
STAFF'S RECOMMENDATION AND

[Captioner] 20:56:08
 I'M 
ASKING YOU ARE YOU SUBSTITUTING, 
THE

[Captioner] 20:56:11
 CITY WILL CONSULT WITH 
MARKET RATE DEVELOPERS

[Captioner] 20:56:15
, HOUSING 
ADVOCATES, WAS IN

[Captioner] 20:56:18
 THIS DRAFT OR 
ARE YOU ADDING TO IT?
WHAT ARE YOU SUGGESTING

[Captioner] 20:56:21
?
>> Councilmember Kassan:  

[Captioner] 20:56:24
 I'M 
NOT SUGGEST ANY CHANGES OTHER 
THAN THE ONE I JUST --

[Captioner] 20:56:27
 I'M NOT 
SURE WHAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO.
BUT I'M

[Captioner] 20:56:30
 JUST -- THERE'S ONE 
PARAGRAPH ON THE FIRST

[Captioner] 20:56:34
 PAGE OF 
THE GREEN SHEET.

[Captioner] 20:56:36

>> Councilmember Campbell:   NOT 
ASKING ABOUT THE GREEN SHEET 


[Captioner] 20:56:39
BECAUSE THE GREEN SHEET IS AN 
ADDITION TO THE -- BECAUSE THE 
MOTION IS

[Captioner] 20:56:42
 TO ACCEPT STAFF'S 
RECOMMENDATION WHICH IS THIS

[Captioner] 20:56:44
 
ELEMENT, CORRECT?
>> Councilmember Kassan:   


[Captioner] 20:56:48
UH-HUH WITH THIS ADDITION THAT 
WAS APPROACHED BY THE GREEN 
SHEET

[Captioner] 20:56:50
.
>> Councilmember Campbell:   YOU 
WANT TO ADD THIS LANGUAGE TO 


[Captioner] 20:56:53
PROGRAM 42.
>> Councilmember Kassan:   MY 
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE 


[Captioner] 20:56:57
PARAGRAPH ON PAGE 1 OF THE GREEN 
SHEET WAS A

[Captioner] 20:57:00
 SUGGESTED ADDITION 
TO CHAPTER 5

[Captioner] 20:57:03
 OF THE HOUSING 
ELEMENT PAGE 5 TO 6.

[Captioner] 20:57:06

AND I'M JUST SUGGESTING INSTEAD 
OF THAT PARAGRAPH, THAT

[Captioner] 20:57:10
 WE 
INSTEAD REPLACE IT WITH THE 
ORIGINALLY

[Captioner] 20:57:13
 REQUESTED PARAGRAPH, 
NO OTHER CHANGES TO THE HOUSING 
ELEMENT

[Captioner] 20:57:18
.

[Captioner] 20:57:21

>> Councilmember Cox:   I THINK 
THAT -- WHAT IF --

[Captioner] 20:57:25
 I'M JUST 
GOING TO OFTEN UP A SUGGESTION.
IF WE KEEP THE

[Captioner] 20:57:28
 ORIGINAL LANGUAGE 
OF THE STAFF, LIST ALL THE 
GROUPS BUT THEN

[Captioner] 20:57:31
 ADD IN 
CARPENTERS UNION ADD LABOR 
GROUPS.


[Captioner] 20:57:34
LABOR ORGANIZATIONS.
I THINK THAT WOULD SOLIDIFY

[Captioner] 20:57:38
 --
>> Mayor Mei:   I WAS GOING TO 
RECOMMEND THAT TOO.


[Captioner] 20:57:41
THAT MAKES IT EASIER.
>> Councilmember Kassan:   IT

[Captioner] 20:57:44
 
SAYS REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE 
RESIDENTIAL

[Captioner] 20:57:47
 CONSTRUCTION 
INDUSTRY.
>> YOU CAN

[Captioner] 20:57:51
 ADD LABOR.
>> Councilmember Kassan:   THE 
SUGGESTED LANGUAGE TALKS

[Captioner] 20:57:54
 ABOUT 
LABOR.
SO I JUST -- WE COULD DO

[Captioner] 20:57:57
 BOTH, 
WE COULD HAVE BOTH.
WHY DON'T WE DO

[Captioner] 20:58:00
 BOTH, CAN WE 
HAVE BOTH?
>> Councilmember Cox:   I THINK 


[Captioner] 20:58:03
IT SHOULD BE ONE TO BE 
CONSISTENT WITH WHAT THE STAFF

[Captioner] 20:58:05
 
HAS.
>> Mayor Mei:   I THINK IT 


[Captioner] 20:58:08
SHOULD BE ONE.
>> Councilmember Cox:   WE ADD 
IN THE

[Captioner] 20:58:11
 ADDITIONAL LABOR, WE 
ACCEPT THE STAFF'S LANGUAGE AS 
IS

[Captioner] 20:58:14
 WITH THE ADDITION OF 
REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE LABOR 
ORGANIZATIONS

[Captioner] 20:58:17
.
>> Mayor Mei:   LABOR 
RESIDENTIAL.


[Captioner] 20:58:20
>> Councilmember Campbell:   
OKAY AND THAT REPLACES WHAT IS 
ALREADY IN THE

[Captioner] 20:58:23
 ELEMENT.
>> Councilmember Kassan:   I 
DON'T ACCEPT THAT AMENDMENT.

[Captioner] 20:58:26

I DIDN'T THINK THIS WOULD BE 
SUCH A BIG DEAL.


[Captioner] 20:58:29
THERE WAS A REQUEST FROM SOMEONE 
WHO TOOK THE TIME TO COMMENT ON 
THE

[Captioner] 20:58:33
 PLAN.
WE WERE TOLD THERE'S NO PROBLEM 
WITH THAT LANGUAGE

[Captioner] 20:58:35
.
SO I WOULD LIKE TO ADD THAT 
LANGUAGE.


[Captioner] 20:58:38
IF WE WANT TO ADD IT IN ADDITION 
TO WHAT STAFF HAD

[Captioner] 20:58:42
, I'DING 
TOTALLY FINE WITH THAT.
I DON'T SEE ANY

[Captioner] 20:58:45
 REASON WHY WE 
COULDN'T HAVE BOTH.
BUT MY MOTION IS TO ADOPT

[Captioner] 20:58:48
 THE 
LANGUAGE SUGGESTED BY THE 
NORTHERN CALIFORNIA CARPENTERS

[Captioner] 20:58:52
 
UNION AS-IS AND WE'VE BEEN TOLD 
THERE'S NO ISSUE

[Captioner] 20:58:55
 WITH THAT.
IT'S NOT TAKING OUT ANYTHING

[Captioner] 20:58:58
 
ABOUT OTHER STAKEHOLDERS THAT IS 
ALREADY INCLUDED

[Captioner] 20:59:03
 IN THE PLAN.
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado:   IT 
DOES

[Captioner] 20:59:06
 NOT REPLACE LANGUAGE.
IT IS ADDITIVE SO IT WOULD

[Captioner] 20:59:09
 JUST 
ADD THAT PHOTOGRAPH TO CHAPTER

[Captioner] 20:59:12
 5 
PAGES 5 THROUGH 6 AND WHAT 
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN

[Captioner] 20:59:16
 HAS DONE 
VIA HER MOTION IS SIMPLY TO 
SUBSTITUTE

[Captioner] 20:59:19
 THE LANGUAGE THAT WAS 
PROFFERED BY STAFF

[Captioner] 20:59:22
 IN RESPONSE

[Captioner] 20:59:25
 
TO PUBLIC COMMENTS RECEIVED ON 
THE HOUSING ELEMENT.


[Captioner] 20:59:28
>> Mayor Mei:   I ACTUALLY LIKE 
THE SUGGESTION

[Captioner] 20:59:31
 BY COUNCILMEMBER 
COX TO ADD THE

[Captioner] 20:59:34
 SECTION ON LABOR.
>> Councilmember Cox:   IF IT'S

[Captioner] 20:59:38
 
NOT ADDED IT'S OVERSIGHT

[Captioner] 20:59:42
.
>> Councilmember Shao:   MADAM 
MAYOR --


[Captioner] 20:59:44
>> Councilmember Kassan:   WE 
HAVE A MOTION AND SECOND 
ALREADY.


[Captioner] 20:59:47
>> Councilmember Shao:   I CAN 
PROPOSE AN ALTERNATIVE MOTION 
RIGHT THERE AND

[Captioner] 20:59:50
 THAT ALTERNATIVE 
MOTION GETS VOTED

[Captioner] 20:59:53
 ON IF 
SECONDED.
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado:   IF

[Captioner] 20:59:56
 I 
MAY MAYOR JUST WANT TO MAKE A

[Captioner] 20:59:59
 
PROCEDURAL CLARIFICATION.


[Captioner] 21:00:03
FIRST I'LL ADDRESS THE MOTION ON 
THE FLOOR.
THERE IS A MOTION ON THE FLOOR

[Captioner] 21:00:06
 
TO CHANGE THE MOTION ON THE 
FLOOR, THE MOVER WOULD

[Captioner] 21:00:09
 NEED TO 
ACCEPT THE AMENDMENT

[Captioner] 21:00:12
.
COUNCILMEMBER SHAO IS DISCUSSING 
A DIFFERENT PROCEDURE

[Captioner] 21:00:16
 ALTOGETHER 
THAT IS MEMORIALIZED IN THE 
COUNCIL HANDBOOK

[Captioner] 21:00:19
.
>> Mayor Mei:   IT IS.
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado:   ABOUT

[Captioner] 21:00:22
 
THE COUNCIL MAY CONSIDER A 
SUBSTITUTE MOTION, THAT IS

[Captioner] 21:00:26
 THE 
TRAYSING IN THE HANDBOOK.
AND THE SUBSTITUTE

[Captioner] 21:00:29
 MOTION IF 
SECONDED TAKES PRECEDENT OVER 
THE

[Captioner] 21:00:33
 ORIGINAL MOTION CAN BE VOTED 
ON FIRST AND IF IT FAILS WE

[Captioner] 21:00:36
 GO 
BACK TO THE ORIGINAL MOTION.
>> Councilmember Cox:  

[Captioner] 21:00:39
 MY 
SUBSTITUTE MOTION WAS TO ACCEPT 
THE HOUSING ELEMENT REPORT AND

[Captioner] 21:00:42
 
WITH THAT ADDITIONAL STATEMENT, 
FOR

[Captioner] 21:00:45
 INCLUDING REPRESENTATIVES 
FROM THE LABOR UNION

[Captioner] 21:00:49

I'M SORRY LABOR ORGANIZATIONS

TO CHAPTER

[Captioner] 21:03:31

[Captioner] 21:17:29
CITY OF FREMONT

[Captioner] 21:18:20

>> Mayor Mei:   I WOULD LIKE TO 
TRY TO BRING THE MEETING BACK, 


[Captioner] 21:18:23
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 21:18:43
THANK YOU.
I'D LIKE TO RESUME

[Captioner] 21:18:46
 THE MEETING.
AND AT THIS TIME, I ONLY HAD

[Captioner] 21:18:50
 ONE 
OTHER ITEM ON THIS COUNCIL 
AGENDA WHICH IS

[Captioner] 21:18:53
 ITEMSENA AND 
IT'S A REFERRAL FOR THE

[Captioner] 21:18:56
 FLAG  
RAISING

[Captioner] 21:18:59
.
AND THE REASON I ADDED THIS 
AGENDA, I KNOW WE'RE

[Captioner] 21:19:02
 GOING TO BE 
TALKING ABOUT THE COUNCIL 
HANDBOOK AT THE TIME

[Captioner] 21:19:05
 OF THE 
RETREAT.
BUT I OFTEN GET ASKED BY

[Captioner] 21:19:09
 MEMBERS 
IN THE PUBLIC, IN THE PAST

[Captioner] 21:19:12
, AND 
SO, ABOUT DATES TO BE ADDED

[Captioner] 21:19:15
.
AND THESE ARE SOME OF THE GROUPS 
SPECIFICALLY

[Captioner] 21:19:20
 THAT ARE OFTEN 
INQUIRED ABOUT,

[Captioner] 21:19:23
 AS WELL AS 
THINKING ABOUT THE FACT THAT 
FREMONT IS REALLY FORTUNATE

[Captioner] 21:19:26
 TO 
HAVE ACCESS TO

[Captioner] 21:19:30
 THE SCHOOL FOR 
THE BLIND AND SCHOOL FOR THE 
DEAF WHICH

[Captioner] 21:19:33
 ARE LOCALLY BASED 
HERE.
THIS IS NOT MEANT TO BE

[Captioner] 21:19:37
 
INCLUDING -- IT IS INCLUDING BUT 
IN THE EXCLUSIVE TO THE

[Captioner] 21:19:40
 
FOLLOWING LIST OF DATES.
SO THAT'S WHY I'M ADDING

[Captioner] 21:19:43
 THIS 
BECAUSE I'VE OFTEN AND I THINK

[Captioner] 21:19:46
 
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE THE 
DISCUSSION IN PUBLIC BECAUSE I 


[Captioner] 21:19:49
WANT PEOPLE JUST LIKE LAST TIME 
WHEN WE HAD THE MEETING

[Captioner] 21:19:53
 TO 
ENSURE PEOPLE RECOGNIZE THAT 
THESE ARE SOME OF THE PEOPLE

[Captioner] 21:19:56
 OR 
DATES THAT WE ARE OFTEN ASKED TO 
INCLUDE AND

[Captioner] 21:19:59
 TO RECOGNIZE IN OUR 
DIVERSE COMMUNITY.
SO

[Captioner] 21:20:01
 I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S ANY 
COMMENTS.
COUNCILMEMBER COX.


[Captioner] 21:20:04
IS THAT FROM BEFORE?


[Captioner] 21:20:09
SURE.


[Captioner] 21:20:14
>> Councilmember Cox:   NOW, 
OKAY HERE WE GO.
I APPRECIATE THE LIST

[Captioner] 21:20:17
 THAT YOU 
PUT TOGETHER.
BUT I THINK

[Captioner] 21:20:20
 LET'S THINK A LITTLE 
BIT ON THE BIG PICTURE, OKAY

[Captioner] 21:20:23
?
SO BACK ON DECEMBER 20th

[Captioner] 21:20:27
, WE 
APPROVED TWO THINGS.
ONE WAS, TO

[Captioner] 21:20:30
 DO THE FLAG RAISING

[Captioner] 21:20:33
 
FOR AFRO AMERICAN HISTORY

[Captioner] 21:20:36
 MONTH, 
BLACK HISTORY MONTH IN FEBRUARY.
SECOND WAS TO HAVE

[Captioner] 21:20:40
 THE CITY 
STAFF

[Captioner] 21:20:43
 DRAFT AND MAKE 
RECOMMENDATIONS ON A FLAG

[Captioner] 21:20:46
 POLICY 
SINCE THERE IS NOT ONE THAT 
EXISTS HERE IN OUR CITY

[Captioner] 21:20:51
.
AND WHEN I LOOK, I'M FINE WITH 
THAT

[Captioner] 21:20:54
 BECAUSE WE'RE DOING WHAT WE 
SAID WE'RE GOING TO DO, RIGHT?
WE

[Captioner] 21:20:58
 TOOK THAT ACTION ON DECEMBER 
20th.
BUT WHEN I LOOK AT THE

[Captioner] 21:21:01
 BIG 
PICTURE, AS WE'VE KIND

[Captioner] 21:21:04
 OF TALKED 
A LOT ABOUT IT DURING SAYING 
WE'RE GOING

[Captioner] 21:21:07
 TO TALK ABOUT OUR 
HANDBOOK, PROCLAMATIONS AND NOW 
LOOKS

[Captioner] 21:21:10
 LIKE WE'RE PROBABLY GOING 
TO BE TAKING

[Captioner] 21:21:14
 TALKING ABOUT FLAG.
WHEN I

[Captioner] 21:21:17
 LOOK AT THE BIG PICTURE  I 
WOULD

[Captioner] 21:21:20
 LIKE TO SEE WHICH MONTH 
WHICH CULTURAL INTEGRATIONS

[Captioner] 21:21:24
 CELEBRATIONS 
WE'RE DOING, WHETHER

[Captioner] 21:21:28
 IT'S BY 
CULTURE OR FLAG RAISING AND 
HAVING IT

[Captioner] 21:21:31
 IN AN ORGANIZED MANNER 
BECAUSE SOME THINGS MIGHT BE 
COMBINED TOGETHER

[Captioner] 21:21:34
 FOR 
EFFICIENCY.
AND I'M THINKING IN TERMS OF AS 


[Captioner] 21:21:37
A CITY AND AS I LOOK AT SOME OF 
THE

[Captioner] 21:21:40
 ECONOMIC INDICATORS, THAT, 
YOU KNOW, THE LAST HALF, WE

[Captioner] 21:21:44
 MAY 
NOT HAVE THE SAME BUDGET THAT WE 
HAVE RIGHT

[Captioner] 21:21:47
 THOUSAND.
THINGS COULD CHANGE.
PROPERTY

[Captioner] 21:21:50
 TAXES NOT BEING PAID, 
SALES TAX

[Captioner] 21:21:53
, DOWN ON, YOU KNOW, 
THE TOURIST

[Captioner] 21:21:57
 THAT WOULD STAY IN 
OUR HOTELS THAT WOULD BE OUR

[Captioner] 21:22:00
 
OTHER SOURCE OF REVENUE COMING 
INTO THE CITY.


[Captioner] 21:22:03
SO I'M LOOKING AT BUDGET 
RESOURCE AND IMPLEMENTATION.
AND I

[Captioner] 21:22:07
 ANY AT THIS POINT WE ALL 
ARE SO DIVERSE

[Captioner] 21:22:10
, WE'RE SO BLESSED 
TO HAVE ALL OF US HERE ON CITY 
COUNCIL

[Captioner] 21:22:13
 AND SO MANY DIFFERENT 
BACKGROUNDS.
BUT I THINK IT

[Captioner] 21:22:16
 WOULD BE GREAT IF 
WE KIND OF TOOK THIS

[Captioner] 21:22:19
, HAVE IT 
KIND OF DRAFTED UP IN SOME SORT 
OF

[Captioner] 21:22:23
 ORGANIZED MANNER, WITH THE 
CITY STAFF TO

[Captioner] 21:22:26
 ADDRESS HOW WE'RE 
CELEBRATE

[Captioner] 21:22:29
ING CULTURAL 
INTEGRATIONS, I'VE DONE THIS

[Captioner] 21:22:32
 IN 
ANOTHER COUNTY THAT WE ARE 
PUTTING

[Captioner] 21:22:36
 TOGETHER DIVERSITY, 
EQUITY, INCLUSION, IT GOES OUT

[Captioner] 21:22:39
 
TO EVEN MORE, JUST FOR THE 
STARTERS

[Captioner] 21:22:42
 IT COULD BE DONE THIS 
AN ORGANIZED MANNER, BECAUSE 
MORE

[Captioner] 21:22:46
 EFFICIENT SEE WHAT HAPPENS 
IN THE MONTH OF JANUARY, WHAT 
HAPPENS IN

[Captioner] 21:22:49
 FEBRUARY WHAT HAPPENS 
IN MARCH, DO WE HAVE THINGS 
COVERED

[Captioner] 21:22:52
, BECAUSE FOR MARCH IT IS 
BIG AS WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH

[Captioner] 21:22:55
 
RIGHT?
AND LISTING

[Captioner] 21:22:59
 LISTING AFGHAN COMMUNITY, 
HERITAGE,

[Captioner] 21:23:02
 WE RAISED ALMOST HALF 
A MILLION DOLLARS

[Captioner] 21:23:06
 IN ARE FOR 
AFGHAN COMMUNITY THAT WAS LISTED

[Captioner] 21:23:09
 
IN THE NEW YORK TIMES.
I DON'T WANT TO RUSH AHEAD,

[Captioner] 21:23:11
 
UNTIL WE HAVE IT KIND OF 
ORGANIZED.


[Captioner] 21:23:14
AND AS LEADERS I THINK WE SHOULD 
HAVE A VISION, A

[Captioner] 21:23:17
 PLAN HOW TO 
IMPLEMENT IT SO THAT WE'RE CLEAR 
AND

[Captioner] 21:23:20
 THAT WE'RE INCLUSIVE.
BECAUSE IF WE DON'T HAVE 
SOMETHING AND

[Captioner] 21:23:24
 SOMEBODY QUICKLY 
READS THIS, THEY

[Captioner] 21:23:27
 DON'T HAVE 
ANYTHING ON JUNETEENTH

[Captioner] 21:23:30
, 
AFGHANISTAN, PAKISTAN, HOW COME 
OUR

[Captioner] 21:23:33
 COMMUNITY IS NOT LISTED ON 
THIS CULTURAL CELEBRATION.

[Captioner] 21:23:36

AND ALSO, HOW WE'RE GOING TO 
HANDLE IT IF WE HAVE FIVE

[Captioner] 21:23:39
 OR SIX 
IN ONE MONTH?
AND MAYBE THIS IS SOMETHING WE 


[Captioner] 21:23:43
COULD EVEN REFER, ONCE THE STAFF

[Captioner] 21:23:46
 
DRAFTS, MAPS IT OUT MONTH BY 
MONTH ON

[Captioner] 21:23:49
 THE CULTURAL 
CELEBRATIONS, SEE WHAT LINES UP 
THERE

[Captioner] 21:23:53
, AND LET'S GIVE SOME HELP 
TO SOME OF OUR

[Captioner] 21:23:56
 MEMBERS THAT SIT 
ON THE HUMAN RELATION

[Captioner] 21:23:59
S 
COMMISSION BECAUSE WE VFD 
UTILIZED THEM FOR SOME

[Captioner] 21:24:02
 OF THESE 
THINGS THAT COULD HELP US OUT 
AND SAYING HERE IS THE

[Captioner] 21:24:06
 INPUT OF 
LETTING US, THEY'RE APPOINTED ON 
OUR COMMISSION

[Captioner] 21:24:09
 REPRESENTING THE 
CITY THAT WE CAN UTILIZE SOME 
OTHER RESOURCES

[Captioner] 21:24:12
 TO HELP US 
ORGANIZE IT.
BECAUSE I JUST FEEL THAT IT

[Captioner] 21:24:15
 
NEEDS TO BE VETTED A LITTLE BIT.
AND I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF

[Captioner] 21:24:18
 
GREAT SENSITIVITY THAT WE'RE ALL 
VERY PROUD OF WHERE OUR

[Captioner] 21:24:22
 HERITAGE 
IS BUT WE ALSO WANT TO CELEBRATE 
THE UNIQUE

[Captioner] 21:24:25
NESS OF WHAT OUR CITY 
OFFERS.
AND

[Captioner] 21:24:28
 HAS AS OUR UNIQUE RESIDENTS 
FROM THE DIVERSE BACKGROUNDS.

[Captioner] 21:24:31

AND I'M JUST THINKING OUT LOUD 
THAT THERE ARE SOME THINGS I 


[Captioner] 21:24:35
THINK WE COULD TAP INTO, SOME 
OTHER RESOURCE TO

[Captioner] 21:24:38
 HELP STAFF 
DRAFT IT

[Captioner] 21:24:42
 THEN HUMAN RELATIONS 
LOOKS AT IT AND THEN IT COMES 
BACK FOR

[Captioner] 21:24:45
 US AT CITY COUNCIL TO 
TAKE A LOOK AT.
I JUST FEEL THAT THIS

[Captioner] 21:24:48
 REFERRAL 
IS A LITTLE

[Captioner] 21:24:52
 -- A LIT NOT 
ORGANIZED AND KIND OF MAPPING 
OUT THE VISION

[Captioner] 21:24:55
 AND MAPPING OUT 
HOW WE CAN REALLY WORK WITH THE 
GROUPS

[Captioner] 21:24:58
.
AND EVEN LIKE THE SENIOR 
CITIZENS

[Captioner] 21:25:01
 MAY WANT SOME IN

[Captioner] 21:25:05
PUT IN 
IT.
I THINK THERE MIGHT

[Captioner] 21:25:08
 BE ANOTHER 
GROUP I CAN'T REMEMBER THE LIST 
OF

[Captioner] 21:25:12
 THE ORGANIZATIONS, BUT AFTER 
OUR CITY STAFF KIND OF DOES THE

[Captioner] 21:25:15
 
MAP, AND THAT'S WHAT I WOULD 
KIND OF LIKE MAKE MY

[Captioner] 21:25:18
 STATEMENT 
AND JUST SEEING HOW WE CAN 
IMPROVE ON THAT VISION

[Captioner] 21:25:21
 HERE AND 
MAKING IT SO THAT ADMINISTER 
PEOPLE CAN HAVE

[Captioner] 21:25:24
 INPUT BUT ALSO 
HAVE IT DRAFTED MONTH

[Captioner] 21:25:27
 BY MONTH.
CULTURAL CELEBRATIONS

[Captioner] 21:25:30
, DO I

[Captioner] 21:25:34
 WE 
HAVE A PROCLAMATION?

[Captioner] 21:25:37

BOUGHT WE DON'T HAVE A 
PROCLAMATION FOR

[Captioner] 21:25:40
 SOME OF THESE 
THINGS.
WE HAVE TO MATCH

[Captioner] 21:25:43
 IT, MAP IT OUT, 
DO WE HAVE STAFF,

[Captioner] 21:25:47
 DO WE HAVE A 
BUDGET, WHO'S BUYING THE

[Captioner] 21:25:50
 FLAGS 
AND WHICH ORGANIZATION, AND WHAT 
IF YOU HAVE TWO

[Captioner] 21:25:53
 ORGANIZATIONS 
THAT COMES FROM THE SAME 
COMMITTEE, HOW ARE WE

[Captioner] 21:25:57
 GOING TO 
HAVE TO SETTLE THAT OUT, THERE 
IS A LOT THERE THAT NEEDS

[Captioner] 21:26:00
 TO BE 
ADDED TO HOW WE IMPLEMENT 
PROCLAMATIONS

[Captioner] 21:26:03
 HOW WE IMPLEMENT 
FLAG RAISING BECAUSE IT ALL

[Captioner] 21:26:06
 KIND 
OF GOES TOGETHER.

[Captioner] 21:26:10

IN DEFERRING IT, HAVE STAFF

[Captioner] 21:26:13
 DO, 
HAVE THEM REFER

[Captioner] 21:26:16
 TO HUMAN 
RELATIONS COMMISSION, HAVE IT 
SENT

[Captioner] 21:26:19
 BACK TO STAFF, THEY SEND IT 
TO US.
I THINK

[Captioner] 21:26:23
 I ADD MY COMMENTS TO 
THAT.
I JUST DON'T WANT

[Captioner] 21:26:26
 TO OFFEND 
ANYONE.
I THINK THAT BY RUSHING THINGS 


[Captioner] 21:26:29
WE NEED TO KNOW A PLAN, A PLACE

[Captioner] 21:26:33
 
AN IMPLEMENTATION AND ESPECIALLY 
WE HAVE A LOT OF THINGS TO 


[Captioner] 21:26:36
REALLY WORK ON RIGHT NOW, 
ESPECIALLY THE LOCAL

[Captioner] 21:26:40
 EMERGENCY 
RESOLUTION THAT WE JUST PASSED 
THAT, YOU KNOW, I

[Captioner] 21:26:43
 WANT TO ALLOW 
SOME OTHER

[Captioner] 21:26:46
 DELEGATE SOME THINGS 
OUT SO OTHER PEOPLE CAN HELP US 
IN MAKING IT

[Captioner] 21:26:50
 -- GIVING US A MORE 
INCLUSIVE INPUT AND

[Captioner] 21:26:53
 PUBLIC SOME 
SORT OF PUBLIC OUTREACH AND 
INPUT BY USING

[Captioner] 21:26:56
 OUR HUMAN 
RELATIONS COMMISSION.


[Captioner] 21:27:01
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.
NEXT IS COUNCILMEMBER SHAO

[Captioner] 21:27:03
.
>> Councilmember Shao:   THANK 
YOU, MADAM MAYOR.


[Captioner] 21:27:07
FIRST OF ALL, I THINK THIS 
REFERRAL

[Captioner] 21:27:10
 IS

[Captioner] 21:27:15
 COMPLEMENTARY TO 
WHAT WE JUST PASSED REGARDING

[Captioner] 21:27:18
 
THE FLAG RAISING EVENT FOR THE 
MONTH OF

[Captioner] 21:27:21
 FEBRUARY FOR AFRICAN 
AMERICANS

[Captioner] 21:27:25
, AND ALSO, THIS

[Captioner] 21:27:28
 WOULD 
BE VERY HELPFUL AND CONSTRUCTIVE 
TO HELP

[Captioner] 21:27:32
 THE STAFF TO COME UP 
WITH

[Captioner] 21:27:36
 A DRAFT OF POLICY AS WELL 
AS

[Captioner] 21:27:39
 PROPOSE DATES, SO THEY'RE NOT 
IN

[Captioner] 21:27:42
 CONFLICT BETWEEN THIS ONE

[Captioner] 21:27:46
 AND 
THE REFERRAL MADE

[Captioner] 21:27:50
 BY 
COUNCILMEMBER COX.
I

[Captioner] 21:27:54
 WELCOME THE CAUTION ONE, THAT 
WE WANT TO

[Captioner] 21:27:59
 REALLY CARRY OUT 
THOSE EVENTS IN AN ORGANIZED

[Captioner] 21:28:02
 
WAY, AND HAVE

[Captioner] 21:28:06
 -- HAVE TO BE COST 
CONSCIOUS AND

[Captioner] 21:28:09
 SO ON AND THAT IS 
EXACTLY WHAT I SAID WHEN WE

[Captioner] 21:28:12
 WERE 
TALKING ABOUT THE REFERRAL MADE

[Captioner] 21:28:16
 
BY COUNCILMEMBER COX.
AND IN TERMS OF THE

[Captioner] 21:28:19
 FLAG, I 
STILL REMEMBER THAT THE

[Captioner] 21:28:22
 BEST 
FLAG THAT WE CAN RAISE AND

[Captioner] 21:28:25
 ALL 
THE PEOPLE IN FREMONT AND BEYOND

[Captioner] 21:28:29
 
ARE PLOWED TO GATHER UNDER, IS 
THE FLAG

[Captioner] 21:28:32
 OF THE STAR

[Captioner] 21:28:35
 AND STRIP 
BANNER.
AND SO LOOKING

[Captioner] 21:28:39
 AT ALL THOSE 
EVENTS A MONTH

[Captioner] 21:28:42
, ACTUALLY, I WAS 
THINK,

[Captioner] 21:28:45
 YOU KNOW, INCLUDING 
ACTUALLY I STILL BELIEVE 
INCLUDING THE

[Captioner] 21:28:53
 FLAG EVENT RAISING 
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE, THE BEST 
FLAG AND THE

[Captioner] 21:28:56
 ONLY FLAG WE ARE 
GOING THE RAISE FOR ALL

[Captioner] 21:28:59
 THE 
EVENTS, TO HONOR ALL THE PEOPLE

[Captioner] 21:29:02
, 
IN FACT THEY ARE ALL INTEGRAL

[Captioner] 21:29:05
 
PARTS OF OUR SOCIETY OF THE 
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA IS

[Captioner] 21:29:08
 THE 
NATIONAL FLAG AND THE NATIONAL 
FLAG ONLY.


[Captioner] 21:29:11
AND IN THAT CASE THERE'S NO 
DISPUTE

[Captioner] 21:29:14
 REGARDING WHAT FLAG 
SHOULD BE RAISED, AND WHO

[Captioner] 21:29:18
 SHOULD 
BUY THE FLAG, AND EVEN TO THE 
SIZE.


[Captioner] 21:29:21
OH, WAIT A MINUTE, LAST MONTH, 
YOU RAISED

[Captioner] 21:29:25
 A VERY BUSINESS FLAG.

[Captioner] 21:29:28

I WANT TO RAISE AN EVEN BIGGER

[Captioner] 21:29:31
 
FLAG.
SURE, I DON'T WANT THAT TO BE A 


[Captioner] 21:29:34
COMPETITION.
SO I AGREE.
WE HAVE TO DO IT IN A

[Captioner] 21:29:38
 VERY 
ORGANIZED WAY, AN ECONOMIC WAY, 
NOT WASTE

[Captioner] 21:29:41
ING THE TAXPAYERS' 
MONEY,

[Captioner] 21:29:44
 NOT DISTRACTING THE WHOLE 
PURPOSE OF

[Captioner] 21:29:48
 OUR CITY COUNCIL, ON 
THOSE

[Captioner] 21:29:51
 CEREMONIAL EVENTS.
RATHER, WE NEED TO FOCUS ON THE 
PRESS

[Captioner] 21:29:55
ING ISSUES, THE CITY OF 
FREMONT IS

[Captioner] 21:29:58
 FACING LIKE SAFETY 
ISSUES,

[Captioner] 21:30:01
 LIKE TRAFFIC, OR

[Captioner] 21:30:03
 LIKE 
THE EMERGENCY WE'RE GOING 
THROUGH.


[Captioner] 21:30:06
SO WITH THAT, I THINK I

[Captioner] 21:30:10
 SUPPORT 
THIS REFERRAL AS

[Captioner] 21:30:15
 A COMPLEMENTARY 
REFERRAL TO THE ONE THAT WE JUST 
PASS

[Captioner] 21:30:18
ED LAST TIME FOR ALL THE 
FLAG RAISING

[Captioner] 21:30:26
 EVENTS.
AND ONCE AGAIN WITH THIS 
HOPEFULLY

[Captioner] 21:30:29
 BEING PASSED, I HOPE

[Captioner] 21:30:32
 
THAT THE CITY STAFF WOULD, YOU 
KNOW, TAKE ALL THE

[Captioner] 21:30:36
 SUGGESTIONS, 
AND THEN COME UP WITH A POLICY

[Captioner] 21:30:41
.
>> Mayor Mei:   IT'S MEANT TO BE 
INCLUSIVE, NOT

[Captioner] 21:30:44
 EXCLUSIVE OF THE 
LIST SO THINGS COULD BE ADDED 
TOO.

[Captioner] 21:30:46

COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN.
>> Councilmember Kassan:   YEAH, 


[Captioner] 21:30:49
I JUST WANTED TO TAKE A STEP 
BACK.
BECAUSE HONESTLY

[Captioner] 21:30:52
 I DON'T REALLY 
UNDERSTAND THE REFERRAL

[Captioner] 21:30:55
.
IF I READ IT, IT'S NOT CLEAR TO 
ME WHAT

[Captioner] 21:30:58
 IT'S SAYING.
I'M GETTING THAT WHAT IT'S 
SAYING IS

[Captioner] 21:31:03
 GUESSING

[Captioner] 21:31:07
 THAT YOU'RE 
RECOMMENDING THAT THE FLAG BE 
RAISED

[Captioner] 21:31:10
 FOR ALL 19 OF THESE 
THINGS IN ADDITION TO THE TWO 
THAT

[Captioner] 21:31:13
 WE HAVE ALREADY AGREED TO.
IF THAT IS WHAT YOU'RE 
SUGGESTING

[Captioner] 21:31:17
 THEN I DO HAVE SOME 
QUESTIONS.
NUMBER ONE IT

[Captioner] 21:31:20
 SEEMS THAT 
PRACTICALLY SPEAKING HAVING 19 
OR IT

[Captioner] 21:31:23
 WOULD BE 21 DIFFERENT FLAG 
RAISINGS THROUGHOUT THE YEAR

[Captioner] 21:31:26
 
WOULD BE, YOU KNOW, PRETTY 
ONEROUS ON STAFF.


[Captioner] 21:31:29
AND BUDGET AND RESOURCES.

[Captioner] 21:31:32

AND THEN THE OTHER -- AND THEN 
OF COURSE

[Captioner] 21:31:36
 TIMING ISSUES COULD BE 
STRANGE.
AND YOU'RE SAYING YOU MIGHT WANT

[Captioner] 21:31:39
 
TO INCLUDE EVEN MORE SO IT JUST 
SEEMS INTERESTING

[Captioner] 21:31:42
 TO -- I'M NOT 
SURE IF YOU ARE PROPOSING 21

[Captioner] 21:31:45
 
DIFFERENT FLAG RAISINGS PER YEAR 
BUT SEEMS

[Captioner] 21:31:49
 LIKE A LOT.
THE OTHER QUESTION I HAVE IS I'M -- AS FAR AS

[Captioner] 21:31:52
 I KNOW THERE 
ARE MANY OF THE THINGS LISTED 
HERE THAT DON'T

[Captioner] 21:31:55
 HAVE FLAGS 
ASSOCIATED WITH THEM.
FOR EXAMPLE I HAPPEN TO BE

[Captioner] 21:31:58
 A

[Captioner] 21:32:01
 
JEWISH AMERICAN AND THERE IS NO 
SUCH THING AS A JEWISH

[Captioner] 21:32:04
 AMERICAN 
HERITAGE MONTH FLAG.
SO

[Captioner] 21:32:08
 I DON'T KNOW -- AND THAT MAY 
BE TRUE FOR A LOT OF THE OTHER 
ONES

[Captioner] 21:32:11
.
SO I GUESS MY QUESTIONS ARE 
NUMBER 1, ARE YOU PROPOSING TO

[Captioner] 21:32:14
 
HAVE 21 DIFFERENT FLAG RAISING

[Captioner] 21:32:18
 
CEREMONIES PER YEAR AT A MINIMUM 
AND

[Captioner] 21:32:21
 TWO, ARE YOU -- WHAT FLAG 
WOULD YOU RAISE

[Captioner] 21:32:24
 IF THERE IS NO 
FLAG FOR THE

[Captioner] 21:32:27
 ONES, SOME OF THE 
ONES ON THE LIST?

[Captioner] 21:32:30

>> Mayor Mei:   WELL WHAT I'M 
PROPOSING IS THAT WE CONSIDER 


[Captioner] 21:32:34
THESE AS ADDITIONAL OPTIONS.
BECAUSE RIGHT THOUSAND THESE ARE 
SOME OF THE DATES

[Captioner] 21:32:37
 THAT WE DO 
CELEBRATE SOME OF THOSE EXISTING

[Captioner] 21:32:40
 
MONTHS AND AGAIN, YOU KNOW, I 
TREKS A

[Captioner] 21:32:43
PI HERITAGE MONTH THERE 
IS A FLAG BUT THEN

[Captioner] 21:32:46
 IT'S WHICH 
ONE DO WE FLY?
BUT I THINK

[Captioner] 21:32:49
 IT'S IMPORTANT 
BECAUSE WHEN WE LOOK AT THAT 
NATIVE AMERICAN

[Captioner] 21:32:52
 HERITAGE MONTH 
WHICH WE HAVE CELEBRATED MANY 
TIMES

[Captioner] 21:32:55
 OVER THE YEARS AND I KNOW 
THAT THIS PAST YEAR

[Captioner] 21:32:59
 MILPITAS 
ALSO RAISED AING THAT FOR 
FILIPINO HERITAGE

[Captioner] 21:33:02
 MONTH.
SO I'M LOOKING AT SOME OF THE 
SURROUNDING CITIES,

[Captioner] 21:33:05
 I'M LOOKING 
AT THE ONES THAT I'VE HAD A

[Captioner] 21:33:08
 LOT 
OF INQUIRIES

[Captioner] 21:33:12
S RECEIVED AND I 
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT IF THERE 
ARE DATES OR SOMETHING

[Captioner] 21:33:15
 YOU FELT 
WAS NOT APPROPRIATE, THAT WE 
HAVE THIS DISCUSSION

[Captioner] 21:33:18
 IN PUBLIC 
SO THAT IF YOU THINK THERE IS 
SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE

[Captioner] 21:33:21
 REMOVED 
I'M HAPPY TO HAVE THAT -- 
ENTERTAIN THAT CONVERSATION TOO

[Captioner] 21:33:24
.
>> Councilmember Kassan:   SO 
WHAT EXACTLY IS THE REFERRAL 


[Captioner] 21:33:27
THEN IS WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
YOU'RE SAYING THE

[Captioner] 21:33:30
 REFERRAL IS TO 
HAVE A FURTHER

[Captioner] 21:33:34
 CONVERSATION 
ABOUT THE ISSUE OR --
>> Mayor Mei:   TO AGREE TO

[Captioner] 21:33:37
 LOOK 
AT ADDING FLAG RAISINGS FOR

[Captioner] 21:33:39
 
CERTAIN DATES.
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT.


[Captioner] 21:33:42
LIKE I MENTIONED BEFORE WE HAVE 
AUXILIARY AWARENESS

[Captioner] 21:33:45
 TODAY AND 
THERE IS A LOGO FOR THAT AND SO 
I THINK THAT

[Captioner] 21:33:48
, YOU KNOW, I'M 
HEARING FROM A LOT

[Captioner] 21:33:52
 OF SCHOOLS 
THAT ARE LOCALLY RAISED, THE 
SCHOOL FOR

[Captioner] 21:33:56
 THE DEAF THE SCHOOL 
FOR THE BLIND ARE UNIQUE FOR

[Captioner] 21:33:58
 
NORTHERN CALIFORNIA OR THE CITY 
OF FREMONT SO I THINK IT'S 


[Captioner] 21:34:02
IMPORTANT JUST LIKE WE DID FOR 
THE

[Captioner] 21:34:05
 BOX ART AND OTHER AREAS TO 
MAKE SURE

[Captioner] 21:34:08
 THEY FEEL INCLUDED.
>> Councilmember Kassan:   ONE 
MORE QUESTION

[Captioner] 21:34:12
 IF WE'RE VOTING ON 
A REFERRAL I WANT TO UNDERSTAND 
EXACTLY

[Captioner] 21:34:15
 WHAT WE'RE VOTING FOR.
IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE PROPOSING

[Captioner] 21:34:18
 
THAT WE ADD THESE 19 THINGS THAT 
WE WOULD RAISE THE

[Captioner] 21:34:21
 FLAG FOR AND 
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF THERE

[Captioner] 21:34:24
 WERE 
SOME OF THESE WHERE THERE IS NO 
FLAG

[Captioner] 21:34:28
?
WE JUST WOULDN'T DO IT OR WE 
COULD

[Captioner] 21:34:31
 COME UP WITH A DIFFERENT 
FLAG?
>> Mayor Mei:  

[Captioner] 21:34:34
 DIFFERENT FLAGS 
OR DIFFERENT THINGS THIS IS

[Captioner] 21:34:37
 IN 
CONJUNCTION WITH THIS BUT THESE 
ARE SOME OF THE COMMUNITIES

[Captioner] 21:34:40
 THAT 
I'VE SEEN FLAGS OR OTHER EVENTS 
HELD

[Captioner] 21:34:43
 FOR THAT SO I THINK IT IS 
SUPPORTIVE OF THAT

[Captioner] 21:34:46
 BUT NOT 
EXCLUSIVE.
>> Councilmember Kassan:   I'M 


[Captioner] 21:34:49
STILL NOT UNDERSTANDING WHAT THE 
REFERRAL IS SAYING BUT MAYBE 
WITH

[Captioner] 21:34:52
 MORE CONVERSATION I COULD 
UNDERSTAND IT BETTER.
THANK YOU

[Captioner] 21:34:55
.
>> Mayor Mei:   COUNCILMEMBER 
CAMPBELL.


[Captioner] 21:34:58
>> Councilmember Campbell:   
OKAY, SO THANK YOU FOR THIS 
REFERRAL

[Captioner] 21:35:01
.
I DID GO OUT AND LOOK

[Captioner] 21:35:04
 AT A 
COUPLE OF OTHER CITIES.
I LOOKED

[Captioner] 21:35:08
 AT MILPITAS AND SAN 
JOSE.
AND WHAT I'M DISCOVERING

[Captioner] 21:35:10
 IS THAT 
THEY ARE DOING MORE

[Captioner] 21:35:14
 OF MONTH 
CELEBRATIONS, OR DAY 
CELEBRATIONS

[Captioner] 21:35:18
, AS OPPOSED TO 
PEOPLE.

[Captioner] 21:35:21

AND I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHY 
WE

[Captioner] 21:35:24
 WOULD CELEBRATE AN INDIVIDUAL 
PERSON

[Captioner] 21:35:27
.
FRED, I

[Captioner] 21:35:31
 CAN'T PRONOUNCE --
>> Mayor Mei:   KA

[Captioner] 21:35:34
RMATSU.

[Captioner] 21:35:38

>> Councilmember Campbell:   
LARRY --


[Captioner] 21:35:41
>> Mayor Mei:   ATUNG

[Captioner] 21:35:45
.

[Captioner] 21:35:49
ATUN

[Captioner] 21:35:52
G.

[Captioner] 21:35:56

MARCH FONG IS THE FIRST

[Captioner] 21:35:58
 --
>> Councilmember Campbell:   WE 
SHOULD BE CONSISTENT BECAUSE I 


[Captioner] 21:36:01
WOULD LIKE YOU TO RAISE THE FLAG 
FOR MY BIRTHDAY.
I'M IMPORTANT,

[Captioner] 21:36:04
 I MEAN SO -- BUT 
I'M JUST SAYING THAT IS THE KIND

[Captioner] 21:36:07
 
OF THING THAT WOULD HAPPEN IF 
WE'RE NOT CONSISTENT.


[Captioner] 21:36:10
WE'LL HAVE PEOPLE COMING OUT AND 
SAY WELL WHY

[Captioner] 21:36:13
 AREN'T YOU 
RECOGNIZING SO-AND-SO WHEN YOU 
RECOGNIZE A

[Captioner] 21:36:16
 PERSON.
AND I THINK THAT WE SHOULD MAKE 
IT MORE BROADER

[Captioner] 21:36:19
 AND WE SHOULD 
KEEP IT TO EITHER A DAY OR A

[Captioner] 21:36:23
 
MONTH.
SO

[Captioner] 21:36:26
 THE, FOR EXAMPLE, NATIVE 
AMERICAN

[Captioner] 21:36:29
 HERITAGE MONTH WASN'T 
INCLUDED IN THIS,

[Captioner] 21:36:32
 VIETNAM 
HERITAGE MONTH.
OH YEAH IT

[Captioner] 21:36:35
 WAS, OKAY.
I THINK I'VE CROSS REFERENCE

[Captioner] 21:36:39
ED 
WITH SOMETHING THAT SAN JOSE WAS 
DOING.

[Captioner] 21:36:43

>> Mayor Mei:   VIETNAMESE 
HERITAGE MONTH.


[Captioner] 21:36:46
>> Councilmember Campbell:   I 
DIDN'T SEE THAT ON THE LIST.
MEXICAN

[Captioner] 21:36:50
 INDEPENDENCE DAY, 
ALTHOUGH WE HAD LATIN HERITAGE

[Captioner] 21:36:53
 
MONTH.
I THINK WE SHOULD BE CONSISTENT 


[Captioner] 21:36:57
WITH EITHER A DAY OR A MONTH AND 
NOT INDIVIDUAL PEOPLE

[Captioner] 21:37:01
.
AND MILPITAS

[Captioner] 21:37:04
, TREKS, THEY HAD IN 
ORDER TO NOT MAKE IT SO

[Captioner] 21:37:07
 TAXING 
ON STAFF AND HAVE WHAT I'VE 
HEARING HERE IS THAT

[Captioner] 21:37:12
 THEY HAD 
COMMUNITIES DO

[Captioner] 21:37:15
 THE CEREMONY 
THEMSELVES.
>> Mayor Mei:   OKAY

[Captioner] 21:37:19
.
>> Councilmember Campbell:   SO 
FOR EXAMPLE, THE

[Captioner] 21:37:22
 AFRICAN 
AMERICAN HISTORICAL, THEY WOULD 
BE THE ONES WHO

[Captioner] 21:37:25
 WOULD SUBMIT AN 
APPLICATION TO US, THEY WOULD 
GET THEIR

[Captioner] 21:37:29
 OWN FLAGS, THE ONLY 
THING WE WOULD DO IS PROVIDE A

[Captioner] 21:37:32
 
VENUE AND SOME TABLES AND SOME 
CHAIRS.


[Captioner] 21:37:35
AND THEY WOULD HAVE TO PLAN IT 
OUT THEMSELVES.
THAT'S

[Captioner] 21:37:38
 ONE MODEL.
AND THEN FOR SAN JOSE

[Captioner] 21:37:41
, THEIR 
MODEL WAS, THEY PICKED THE DAYS, 
SIMILAR

[Captioner] 21:37:44
 TO WHAT WE'RE DOING AND 
THEN THE CITY HOST

[Captioner] 21:37:48
ED IT 
THEMSELVES.
SO THERE'S SOME VARIATIONS

[Captioner] 21:37:51
 OF 
WAYS IN WHICH WE COULD DO THIS 
BUT I DO THINK

[Captioner] 21:37:56
 THAT 21 MIGHT BE 
A BIT

[Captioner] 21:37:59
 MUCH BECAUSE THAT'S LIKE 
21, YOU KNOW THAT'S MORE DAYS

[Captioner] 21:38:02
 -- 
MORE DAYS A YEAR

[Captioner] 21:38:05
 OR MONTH MONTHS 
IN A YEAR.
SO WE MAY WANT

[Captioner] 21:38:08
 TO NARROW IT OR 
WE MAY WANT TO DO A COMBO

[Captioner] 21:38:11
 WHICH 
WE COULD DO THAT WHICH MEANS 
THAT WE COULD RECOGNIZE

[Captioner] 21:38:15
 SEVERAL 
IN A MONTH OR -- AND I

[Captioner] 21:38:18
 DO AGREE 
WITH COUNCILMEMBER COX

[Captioner] 21:38:23
 THAT WHEN 
ARE THESE?
BECAUSE THERE MAY BE SOME 


[Captioner] 21:38:26
OVERLAPPING, THERE MIGHT BE TWO 
IN MARCH, IF THERE'S TWO IN

[Captioner] 21:38:30
 
MARCH WE'LL DO TWO IN MARCH, IF 
THERE'S TWO

[Captioner] 21:38:33
 IN APRIL WE'LL DO 
TWO IN APRIL

[Captioner] 21:38:36
.
THOSE ARE MY COMMENTS.
I LIKE THE LIST AS A FIRST

[Captioner] 21:38:40
 PASS 
BUT I DO THINK THAT WE NEED TO 
SCRUB

[Captioner] 21:38:43
 IT A LITTLE BIT MORE.
THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei:   I'M GLAD

[Captioner] 21:38:46
 THAT 
YOU'RE SUPPORTIVE OF THIS 
BECAUSE I THINK MANY GROUPS AS 


[Captioner] 21:38:49
YOU MENTIONED IN OTHER CITIES 
HAVE ACTED ON THIS AND THEY'VE

[Captioner] 21:38:52
 
ASKED US BUT IF THERE'S DATES 
THAT YOU THINK

[Captioner] 21:38:55
 ARE, I MEAN PART 
OF WHY WE'RE DOING THESE DATES 
WHETHER

[Captioner] 21:38:59
 IT'S THE RECOGNITION AND 
PROCLAMATION OR IN RAISING THE

[Captioner] 21:39:02
 
FLAG IS THE FACT THAT WE WANT 
PEOPLE TO BECOME

[Captioner] 21:39:05
 EDUCATED AND TO 
BE AWARE.
BECAUSE MANY OF THOSE PEOPLE

[Captioner] 21:39:08
 
THAT WE MENTIONED, FRED KAR

[Captioner] 21:39:11
MATZU 
FOR EXAMPLE, PEOPLE DON'T KNOW 
THAT

[Captioner] 21:39:14
 HE STOOD UP AND ESPECIALLY 
FOR THE JAPANESE IN

[Captioner] 21:39:18
 OUR CITY AND 
WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THE PEOPLE 
WHO ARE RESIDENTS YOU MAY

[Captioner] 21:39:21
 NOT BE 
AWARE THAT EVEN IN OUR CITY AS 
PROGRESSIVE

[Captioner] 21:39:24
 AS WE ARE AS A 
COMMUNITY THAT UP UNTIL ABOUT 
FOUR

[Captioner] 21:39:27
 YEARS AGO, FIVE YEARS AGO, 
I BELIEVE ON THE PLANNING 
COMMISSION SOMEBODY

[Captioner] 21:39:31
 HAD CALLED 
OUT THAT ONE OF OUR HOMEOWNERS 
ASSOCIATION

[Captioner] 21:39:34
 ACTUALLY HAD IN 
THEIR HOAS UP UNTIL FIVE

[Captioner] 21:39:37
 YEARS 
AGO THEY COULDN'T SELL HOMES TO 
JAPANESE OR TO

[Captioner] 21:39:40
 ASIANS.
THESE TYPE OF THINGS ARE CURRENT 
TODAY SO THAT'S WHY

[Captioner] 21:39:43
 THE 
EDUCATION AWARENESS OF THIS IS 
VERY IMPORTANT, I APPRECIATE

[Captioner] 21:39:47
 
YOUR COMMENTS AND FEEDBACK BUT 
THIS IS AN EXCELLENT OPPORTUNITY

[Captioner] 21:39:50
 
FOR US TO EDUCATE.

[Captioner] 21:39:53

IN FACT MOST RECENT THE U.S. 
GOVERNMENT AND PRESIDENT BIDEN

[Captioner] 21:39:56
 
DECIDED TO PRESERVE THE INTER

[Captioner] 21:39:59

INTERMENT CAMPS SO PEOPLE CAN 
SEE THE TRAVESTY AND

[Captioner] 21:40:04
 THE THINGS 
THAT ARE GOOD AND BAD SO PEOPLE 
CAN BE AWARE OF

[Captioner] 21:40:07
 THIS AND BE 
EDUCATED SO I APPRECIATE THAT 
SUPPORT.

[Captioner] 21:40:09

>> Councilmember Campbell:   AND 
I AGREE WITH YOU.


[Captioner] 21:40:12
I'M NOT SAYING THAT THEY'RE NOT 
IMPORTANT.
WHAT I'M SAYING

[Captioner] 21:40:15
 IS WHAT WE'RE 
DOING IS WE'RE SETTING A 
PRECEDENT

[Captioner] 21:40:18
 HERE SO THAT EVERYBODY 
WHO FEELS LIKE SOMEBODY IN THEIR

[Captioner] 21:40:21
 
COMMUNITY, LIKE WHY DON'T WE DO 
A MARTIN LUTHER KING

[Captioner] 21:40:24
 DAY?
>> Councilmember Cox:   THAT'S 
RIGHT.


[Captioner] 21:40:27
>> Councilmember Campbell:   
AROUND PUT THAT ONE DOWN.

[Captioner] 21:40:30

OR HARRIET TUBMAN DAY OR SOME 
OTHER PERSON

[Captioner] 21:40:34
 TODAY.
SO I JUST DON'T WANT US TO SET A

[Captioner] 21:40:37
 
PRECEDENT WHERE EVERYBODY IS 
GOING TO COME OUT AND SAY PLEASE 


[Captioner] 21:40:40
ADD THIS PERSON BECAUSE THEY 
WERE IMPORTANT TO MY COMMUNITY 
AND

[Captioner] 21:40:43
 THEY HAVE A

[Captioner] 21:40:47
 HISTORICAL 
IMPORTANCE TO MY HERITAGE AND

[Captioner] 21:40:50
 I 
WANT YOU TO ADD THEM, TOO.
>> Mayor Mei:   I AGREE ON

[Captioner] 21:40:54
 THAT 
IDEA BUT I THINK THAT ALSO SOME 
OF THE MONTHS THAT ARE LISTED

[Captioner] 21:40:57
 IF 
WE ARE GOING TO LIMIT OURSELVES 
TO MONTHS

[Captioner] 21:41:00
 THERE IS OVERLAP DENT.
BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT SOME OF 
THE

[Captioner] 21:41:03
 DATES THERE ARE OVERLAP.
THEY DON'T

[Captioner] 21:41:07
 SPECIFICALLY FALL ON 
OCTOBER 1st OR WHATEVER THAT 
DATE

[Captioner] 21:41:11
 IS ITSELF.
HOW ARE WE GOING TO HANDLE THAT, 
DOES

[Captioner] 21:41:14
 THAT MEAN IT WILL FLY FOR A 
IF YOU DAYS

[Captioner] 21:41:17
 AS OPPOSED TO A 
MONTH.
WE CAN'T BALANCE THAT.


[Captioner] 21:41:20
I THINK COUNCILMEMBER SHAO'S 
POINT EARLIER WHEN WE APPROVED

[Captioner] 21:41:23
 
THE LAST DECISION AT THE COUNCIL 
MEETING THAT WE WERE ASKING

[Captioner] 21:41:26
 
ABOUT DEFINITION AND CLARITY.
BECAUSE

[Captioner] 21:41:29
 AGAIN, YOU KNOW, FOR US, 
WE'RE LOOKING AT ALL

[Captioner] 21:41:33
 THE 
DIFFERENT RESSMENTSDZ AND

[Captioner] 21:41:36
 REPRESENTATIVES AND 
WE'RE PROUD

[Captioner] 21:41:39
 THAT WE HAVE SUCH AN 
INCREDIBLE COMMUNITY.
BUT

[Captioner] 21:41:42
 TO BE ABLE TO SAY IF WE'RE 
NOT GOING TO RECOGNIZE IT THEN

[Captioner] 21:41:44
 
WE WANT PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND 
WHY.


[Captioner] 21:41:47
SO I THINK THAT IF WE'RE GOING 
TO STICK TO

[Captioner] 21:41:50
 MONTHS THAT WOULD 
MAKE SENSE IN TERMS OF ETHNIC

[Captioner] 21:41:53
 
MONTHS VERSUS INDIVIDUAL 
BIRTHDAYS BUT

[Captioner] 21:41:57
 WE WOULD WANT TO 
HAVE A CONSISTENT POLICY FOR

[Captioner] 21:41:59
 
THROUGHOUT THE CITY SO IT 
WOULDN'T BE ONE PERSON WOULD GET 


[Captioner] 21:42:03
RECOGNIZED AND THE OTHERS DON'T.
SO I THINK

[Captioner] 21:42:06
 IT'S VERY VALID.
>> Councilmember Campbell:   
CORRECT

[Captioner] 21:42:09
 THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 21:42:12

>> MAY I MAKE A COMMENT?
>> Mayor Mei:   SURE.


[Captioner] 21:42:15
>> STEPPING BACK TO OUR LAST 
MEETING IN DECEMBER, YOU

[Captioner] 21:42:18
 ALL 
APPROVED THE RAISING OF A FLAG 
FOR THE MONTH OF FEBRUARY

[Captioner] 21:42:21
.
BUT YOU ALSO GAVE STAFF 
DIRECTION TO

[Captioner] 21:42:25
 COME BACK TO YOU 
ALL WITH

[Captioner] 21:42:28
 SOME POLICY 
RECOMMENDATIONS AROUND 
FLAG-RAISING

[Captioner] 21:42:31
.
WHAT WOULD IT LOOK LIKE, HOW 
WOULD IT BE

[Captioner] 21:42:34
 FUNDED, WHEN WOULD 
WE DO IT, WHAT ARE THE 
PARAMETERS

[Captioner] 21:42:39
.
SO IT SEEMS THAT YOU

[Captioner] 21:42:42
 KNOW GIVEN 
US AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT

[Captioner] 21:42:45
 
FIRST WOULD ANSWER SOME OF THESE 
QUESTIONS AND

[Captioner] 21:42:48
 ADDRESS SOME OF 
THE DISCUSSION POINTS THAT I'M

[Captioner] 21:42:52
 
HEARING AMONGST YOU ALL THIS 
EVENING.


[Captioner] 21:42:55
SO IT'S JUST SOMETHING FOR YOU 
TO CONSIDER AS YOU CONTINUE

[Captioner] 21:42:59
 YOUR 
DELIBERATION.
AND I DO HAVE TO SAY WE HAD

[Captioner] 21:43:03
 A 
HEARTY CONVERSATION EARLIER 
TODAY ABOUT STAFFING AND ADD

[Captioner] 21:43:07
ING 
CODE ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS AND 
JUST NEEDING MORE

[Captioner] 21:43:10
 STAFFING.
WE'RE A VERY, VERY LEAN CITY.

[Captioner] 21:43:13

WE HAVE 9

[Captioner] 21:43:16
60 FTES AND 240,000

[Captioner] 21:43:19
 
RESIDENTS.
AND OF THOSE 9

[Captioner] 21:43:22
65 FTES WE 
PROBABLY HAVE 100 VACANCY

[Captioner] 21:43:25
IES, 
BECAUSE ALSO AS WE DISCUSSED 
EARLIER

[Captioner] 21:43:28
, IT IS REALLY DIFFICULT 
TO FILL POSITIONS RIGHT

[Captioner] 21:43:32
 NOW.
SO AGAIN

[Captioner] 21:43:35
, JUST SOME THINGS FOR 
YOU TO-AS YOU CONTINUE YOUR

[Captioner] 21:43:38
 
DELIBERATION 

[Captioner] 21:43:41
.
>> Mayor Mei:   COUNCILMEMBER 
SHAO DID YOU --

[Captioner] 21:43:43

>> Councilmember Shao:   YES, 
THANK YOU MADAM MAYOR.


[Captioner] 21:43:46
I AGREE THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO 
MAKE SURE ALL THE

[Captioner] 21:43:50
 DETAILS ARE 
IRONED OUT BEFORE WE APPROVE

[Captioner] 21:43:54
 
THIS REFERRAL.
LET'S LEAVE THAT TO THE CITY

[Captioner] 21:43:57
 
STAFF TO FIGURE OUT A POLICY

[Captioner] 21:44:00
.
ALL WE NEED TO DO IS TO AGREE IN

[Captioner] 21:44:04
 
GENERAL WHETHER TO AGREE

[Captioner] 21:44:08
 THAT 
THE PRECEDENT IS ALREADY SET.
ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS

[Captioner] 21:44:11
 TO BE 
INCLUSIVE AND ADD MORE DATES,

[Captioner] 21:44:16
 OR 
KILL THIS

[Captioner] 21:44:19
 REFERRAL BY SAYING NO.
THAT WOULD BE THE ONLY TWO

[Captioner] 21:44:23
.
AND TO ME,

[Captioner] 21:44:26
 I DON'T THINK THAT IS 
INCLUSIVE AT ALL.

[Captioner] 21:44:29

IN TERMS OF THE CANDIDATES FOR 
THE MONTH OR

[Captioner] 21:44:32
 THE DAY, I THINK 
STILL, THE STAFF CAN

[Captioner] 21:44:35
 COME WITH A 
POLICY

[Captioner] 21:44:39
, AND AS THE REFERRAL 
SAYS, IT'S INCLUDING

[Captioner] 21:44:42
 BUT NOT 
EXCLUSIVE TO.

[Captioner] 21:44:45

SO TODAY, WE DON'T HAVE TO GO 
INTO DETAILS AND SAY

[Captioner] 21:44:48
 OH, I DON'T 
LIKE THIS DATE, LET'S CROSS IT 
OUT

[Captioner] 21:44:52
 FROM THE LIST, OR HEY, WAIT 
A MINUTE, YOU MISSED

[Captioner] 21:44:55
 SOME MORE 
DATES.
LET'S JUST EXHAUST ALL

[Captioner] 21:44:59
 THE LISTS 
BEFORE WE

[Captioner] 21:45:03
 APPROVE THE REFERRAL.
I THINK THIS REFERRAL SAYS WE

[Captioner] 21:45:06
 
NEED TO BE INCLUSIVE SO THAT 
MORE DATES ARE PROPOSED.


[Captioner] 21:45:09
AS FOR HOW TO REALLY HONOR THOSE 
DATES

[Captioner] 21:45:12
 OR MONTH, THEN WE HAVE TO

[Captioner] 21:45:15
 
REALLY RELY ON THE STAFF TO COME 
UP WITH

[Captioner] 21:45:19
 A PRACTICAL WAY AND 
ORGANIZE THE WAIM, ECONOMIC WAY

[Captioner] 21:45:22
, 
TO DO SO.
IN TERMS OF WHAT KIND OF

[Captioner] 21:45:25
 FLAG TO 
FLY AND AS I SAID BEFORE

[Captioner] 21:45:28
, YOU 
KNOW, THESE ARE THE DETAILS.
TODAY

[Captioner] 21:45:31
 WHETHER WE AGREE WITH THIS 
IN PRINCIPLE OR NOT

[Captioner] 21:45:34
, IT'S WHAT 
WE HAVE TO DECIDE HERE.
OTHERWISE

[Captioner] 21:45:38
, I DON'T THINK TONIGHT 
IS LONG ENOUGH FOR US

[Captioner] 21:45:41
 TO EXHAUST 
ALL THE TOPICS ON THIS REFERRAL

[Captioner] 21:45:44
.
THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 21:45:47

>> Mayor Mei:   COUNCILMEMBER 
SALWAN.


[Captioner] 21:45:50
>> Councilmember Salwan:   THANK 
YOU MADAM MAYOR AND THANK YOU TO 
MY COLLEAGUES FOR

[Captioner] 21:45:53
 YOUR FEEDBACK.
WHILE I THINK THIS IS A

[Captioner] 21:45:57
 GOOD 
SUGGESTION BY THE MAYOR TO LOOK 
AT THIS, LOOK

[Captioner] 21:46:00
 AT THE VARIOUS 
MONTHS, AND

[Captioner] 21:46:03
 FESTIVALS AND ALL OF 
THAT, I THINK WE HAVE A RETREAT

[Captioner] 21:46:06
 
COMING UP IN FEBRUARY WHICH IS A 
GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO FLUSH

[Captioner] 21:46:09
 THESE 
THINGS OUT.
WE DO HAVE A FLAG

[Captioner] 21:46:12
 POLICY COMING 
UP AND I THINK I WOULD BE OPEN

[Captioner] 21:46:16
 
TO STUDYING THESE DAYS AND MAYBE 
MORE AT

[Captioner] 21:46:19
 THAT RETREAT WHERE WE 
CAN GO IN MORE DETAIL

[Captioner] 21:46:22
, AFTER 
STAFF HAS PREPARED A POLICY.
I

[Captioner] 21:46:25
 DON'T WANT TO GET IN THE 
WEEDS.
I THINK -- DEBATE

[Captioner] 21:46:29
 EACH DAY OR 
THINGS LIKE THAT.
IF WE

[Captioner] 21:46:32
 CAN MOVE THIS FORWARD AS 
PART OF A COMPREHENSIVE 
DISCUSSION

[Captioner] 21:46:35
 DURING OUR RETREAT 
THEN WE CAN HAVE, YOU

[Captioner] 21:46:38
 KNOW 
FIGURE OUT WHICH ONE WE DON'T

[Captioner] 21:46:41
 
WANT, WHY WE DON'T WANT IT AND 
SO FORTH.


[Captioner] 21:46:44
I WILL SAY CERTAIN CITIES DON'T

[Captioner] 21:46:47
 
ALLOW CERTAIN RELIGIONS, CERTAIN 
DATES

[Captioner] 21:46:50
 AND CERTAIN TYPES OF 
THINGS.
ALL THAT NEEDS TO BE

[Captioner] 21:46:53
 FLUSHED OUT 
AND I DON'T THINK WE HAVE THE 
BANDWIDTH

[Captioner] 21:46:57
 TO DO THAT.
I'D BE HAPPY TO MOVE THIS 
FORWARD

[Captioner] 21:47:00
 AS PART OF A 
COMPREHENSIVE DISCUSSION AT

[Captioner] 21:47:03
 OUR 
STAFF RETREAT.
LIM I'M SUPPORTIVE OF

[Captioner] 21:47:06
 THAT BUT 
IF WE SEND IT OUT TO ALL THE 
COMMISSION

[Captioner] 21:47:09
S IT WILL BE ANOTHER 
YEAR BEFORE WE HEAR BACK

[Captioner] 21:47:12
.
COUNCILMEMBER KENG, NEXT.
>> Vice Mayor Keng:   SO AS I 


[Captioner] 21:47:16
RECALL AND ALSO EARLIER, AS 
MENTIONED BY

[Captioner] 21:47:20
 OUR CITY MANAGER 
SHACKELFORD, THAT

[Captioner] 21:47:24
 THE CITY 
COUNCIL RECENTLY JUST

[Captioner] 21:47:27
 VOTED TO 
HAVE THE STAFF PREPARE KIND OF A 
FLAGS POLICY

[Captioner] 21:47:32
.
AND YOU KNOW AS MENTIONED 
EARLIER WE ARE OPERATING

[Captioner] 21:47:35
 ON A 
VERY LEAN

[Captioner] 21:47:38
 STAFFING FOR OUR CITY 
AND IT'S, IF

[Captioner] 21:47:41
 WE ARE LOOKING TO 
HAVE 21 FLAG RAISING

[Captioner] 21:47:45
 AND ALL THE 
LOGISTICS THAT GOES WITH IT AND 
ALL THE

[Captioner] 21:47:48
 PEOPLE TO INVITE, WHO TO 
INCLUDE AND ALL THE

[Captioner] 21:47:51
 PROGRAM AND 
EVERYTHING THAT TO MAKE A FLAG 
FOR

[Captioner] 21:47:54
 A CORRECT FLAG AND OTHER 
GROUPS THAT

[Captioner] 21:47:58
 MAY HAVE BEEN LEFT 
OUT, I THINK IT WOULD BE

[Captioner] 21:48:01
 VERY 
TAXING ON THE STAFF

[Captioner] 21:48:04
.
AND EARLIER

[Captioner] 21:48:08
 HAD COUNCILMEMBER 
CAMPBELL MENTIONED IF WE ARE 
HONORING INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE

[Captioner] 21:48:13
 
NOT HONOR NATIONALLY LIKE

[Captioner] 21:48:16
 MARTIN 
LUTHER KING, I THINK WE'RE KIND 
OF

[Captioner] 21:48:19
 GOING TO BE INVITING 
OURSELVES TO

[Captioner] 21:48:22
 OTHER GROUPS THAT 
WOULD SAY HOW COME

[Captioner] 21:48:25
, WE WANT TO 
HONOR OUR LEADER, WE WANT TO 
HONOR LIKE

[Captioner] 21:48:28
 I KNOW LIKE SOME OF 
THE RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS

[Captioner] 21:48:32
, 
ALSO YOU KNOW DO HONORING LIKE

[Captioner] 21:48:37
 
THESE ANNUAL HONORING OF THEIR 
LEADER SO WE'RE

[Captioner] 21:48:40
 KIND OF OPENING 
OURSELVES TO SOMETHING

[Captioner] 21:48:43
 THAT 
COULD BE POTENTIALLY A HUGE 
ISSUE IN THE FUTURE

[Captioner] 21:48:47
.
SO I THINK WE SHOULD WAIT FOR 
STAFF TO

[Captioner] 21:48:50
 COME UP WITH A FLAG 
FOLLOW AND WHAT, YOU KNOW, IF WE

[Captioner] 21:48:53
 
ARE DOING IT MONTHLY, IF WE ARE 
DOING IT EVERY OTHER

[Captioner] 21:48:56
 MONTH 
BECAUSE WE MIGHT NOT EVEN BE 
ABLE TO

[Captioner] 21:48:59
 AFFORD THE TIME AND 
RESOURCES TO DO A

[Captioner] 21:49:02
 MONTHLY FLAG 
RAISING

[Captioner] 21:49:06
.
SO I THINK THAT IF WE ARE -- I 
APPRECIATE THE

[Captioner] 21:49:09
 MAYOR'S INTENTION 
COMING UP WITH

[Captioner] 21:49:12
 THIS LIST.
BUT SOME OF THESE ITEMS ARE 
REPETITIVE

[Captioner] 21:49:16
 AND MAYBE LIKE 
EARLIER, AS MENTIONED

[Captioner] 21:49:19
 BY 
COUNCILMEMBER COX, SOME GROUPS 
ARE NOT INCLUDED.


[Captioner] 21:49:22
SO I THINK IT WOULD BE BETTER TO

[Captioner] 21:49:25
 
HONOR GROUPS INSTEAD OF KIND OF

[Captioner] 21:49:29
 
INDIVIDUALS, AND THERE WOULD 
BE -- IF WE'RE LOOKING

[Captioner] 21:49:32
 AT KIND 
OF THE TYPES OF PEOPLE THAT 
WE'RE HONOR

[Captioner] 21:49:36
ING ACCORDING TO THIS 
LIST THEN THERE WOULD BE DOZENS 
OF

[Captioner] 21:49:39
 OTHERS THAT WANT TO BE 
HONORED.
SO I THINK WE SHOULD KIND

[Captioner] 21:49:43
 OF 
WAIT FOR THE STAFF TO COME UP 
WITH A FLAG

[Captioner] 21:49:47
 POLICY AND WHAT KIND

[Captioner] 21:49:50
 
OF PROGRAM THAT THE STAFF

[Captioner] 21:49:53
 ARE 
CAPABLE OF DOING OR, YOU KNOW, 
HOW

[Captioner] 21:49:57
 OFTEN AND WHAT WE CAN GROUP 
TOGETHER, I THINK THAT

[Captioner] 21:50:01
 WOULD BE 
PROBABLY BE A MORE APPROPRIATE, 
THANK YOU

[Captioner] 21:50:04
.
>> Mayor Mei:   I'M OPEN TO THE 
IDEA BUT I

[Captioner] 21:50:11
 WANTED TO BE 
CONSCIENTIOUS OF DATES

[Captioner] 21:50:14
 THAT ARE 
UPCOMING, SO WE DON'T SKIP OVER

[Captioner] 21:50:16
 
MONTHS.
I UNDERSTAND THAT PERSPECTIVE 


[Captioner] 21:50:19
BUT IF WE ARE GOING TO SEND IT 
OUT TO OTHER GROUPS,

[Captioner] 21:50:22
 I DON'T 
KNOW, SOMETIMES COUNCIL 
REFERRALS GO FOR

[Captioner] 21:50:25
 30, 60, 90 DAYS 
OUT.
OUR

[Captioner] 21:50:29
 RETREAT WILL BE TO THE END 
OF FEBRUARY AND WE'LL

[Captioner] 21:50:32
 BE PUSHING 
MARCH AT THAT TIME, WHETHER IT'S

[Captioner] 21:50:35
 
WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH OR OTHER 
DATES THAT ARE COMING, I WANT

[Captioner] 21:50:38
ED 
TO MAKE SURE WE DIDN'T MISS JUST 
BECAUSE OF THE FACT

[Captioner] 21:50:41
 THAT WE HAD 
LOOKED AT IT.
JUST LIKE IN THE PAST WHEN

[Captioner] 21:50:44
 IT 
COMES FOR OUR BUDGET, AT ONE 
POINT

[Captioner] 21:50:48
 WE USED SOME OF OUR 
FUNDING TO HELP

[Captioner] 21:50:51
 LOCAL 
ORGANIZATIONS TO HOLD EVENTS, TO 
RECOGNIZE IT, WE

[Captioner] 21:50:54
 WANTED PEOPLE 
TO

[Captioner] 21:50:57
 SUBMIT APPLICATIONS, WE 
LOOKED AT IT

[Captioner] 21:51:01
 COMPREHENSIVELY, 
NOT

[Captioner] 21:51:04
 ON ONESIES TWO

[Captioner] 21:51:07
SIES AND SUCH, 
I'M SURE PEOPLE WILL HAVE

[Captioner] 21:51:09
 
FEEDBACK ON THAT AND I THINK 
IT'S IMPORTANT.


[Captioner] 21:51:12
SOME OF THESE DATES LIKE NATIVE 
AMERICAN HERITAGE

[Captioner] 21:51:16
 MONTH, ASIAN 
HERITAGE MONTH, HAVE

[Captioner] 21:51:19
 BEEN ONES 
SINCE ASIAN HERITAGE HAS BEEN 
SINCE

[Captioner] 21:51:22
 THE 1970s.
SO IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE DON'T 
OVERLOOK

[Captioner] 21:51:25
 THAT.
AND WHEN I THINK ABOUT 
DIVERSITY,

[Captioner] 21:51:30
 IT IS, YOU KNOW, 
AGAIN WE CAN LOOK AT SOME OF THE 
EXAMPLES BUT I

[Captioner] 21:51:33
 THINK IT'S 
IMPORTANT THAT WE CELEBRATE SOME 
OF THE UNIQUE SETS OF

[Captioner] 21:51:36
 AND 
OFFERINGS THAT MAKE FREMONT A 
WELCOMING

[Captioner] 21:51:39
 COMMUNITY SUCH AS 
TREKS THE DEAF AND BLIND 
AWARENESS

[Captioner] 21:51:42
.
SO THAT'S WHY I THINK IT'S 
IMPORTANT

[Captioner] 21:51:46
.
COUNCILMEMBER SHAO, YOU'RE NEXT 
AGAIN OR MAYBE

[Captioner] 21:51:49
 --
>> Councilmember Kassan:   I'VE 
HAD MY HAND RAISED FOR A

[Captioner] 21:51:53
 LONG 
TIME.
>> Mayor Mei:   I'M GOING ON 


[Captioner] 21:51:56
ORDER OFF THE DAIS, I DON'T KNOW 
WHAT HAPPENED, I

[Captioner] 21:51:59
 SEE JENNY AFTER 
COUNCILMEMBER SHAO AND THEN

[Captioner] 21:52:02
 RAJ 
AND TERESA.
I'M LOOKING AT THE ORDER OF 


[Captioner] 21:52:05
THEM.
>> Councilmember Shao:   THANK 
YOU, MADAM MAYOR.


[Captioner] 21:52:08
I DID PRESS MY BUTTON LONG TIME 
AGO.
I JUST WANT

[Captioner] 21:52:11
 TO SAY IT AGAIN.
YOU KNOW, THIS LIST IS NOT 
NECESSARILY

[Captioner] 21:52:14
 THE FINAL LIST.
SOME OF THE DAYS

[Captioner] 21:52:18
 COULD BE 
COMBINED WITH OTHER DATES OR 
MONTHS.

[Captioner] 21:52:21

BUT THE IDEA IS

[Captioner] 21:52:25
 TO WHETHER ADD 
MORE DATES FOR THE FLAG RAISING

[Captioner] 21:52:29
 
TO BE INCLUSIVE, OR KILL

[Captioner] 21:52:32
 THIS 
REFERRAL TO KEEP ONLY

[Captioner] 21:52:36
 TWO FLAG 
RAISING EVENTS FROM NOW ON

[Captioner] 21:52:39
.
REGARDLESS WHETHER

[Captioner] 21:52:43
 THE STAFF 
MAKES A POLICY OR

[Captioner] 21:52:46
 NOT.

[Captioner] 21:52:49

BECAUSE WE ALREADY VOTED ON THAT 
AND THAT'S ALREADY IN THE RECORD

[Captioner] 21:52:51

RECORD.
REGARDLESS OF THE NATURE OF THE 


[Captioner] 21:52:55
LIST, HOW LONG OR SHORT, THE 
STAFF

[Captioner] 21:52:59
 IS INSTRUCTED TO COME UP 
WITH A POLICY

[Captioner] 21:53:02
 ANYWAY.
SO TODAY

[Captioner] 21:53:06
, AS LONG AS WE HAVE 
SOME FLEXIBILITY

[Captioner] 21:53:09
, AS TO THE

[Captioner] 21:53:13
 
NATURE OF THE LIST, WHETHER IT

[Captioner] 21:53:16
 
BEING, YOU KNOW, WE CAN ONLY ADD 
ON THE LIST, WE

[Captioner] 21:53:19
 CANNOT TAKE DAYS 
OFF THE LIST OR COMBINE DAYS 
WITH OTHER

[Captioner] 21:53:23
 DAYS.
AS LONG AS WE HAVE THAT 
FLEXIBILITY OF

[Captioner] 21:53:26
 DOING SO, I DON'T 
SEE WHY WE

[Captioner] 21:53:31
 CANNOT HAVE NOR DAYS 
FOR FLAG RAISING

[Captioner] 21:53:35
, THAN THE 
CURRENT TWO

[Captioner] 21:53:38
 THAT THE CITY 
COUNCIL HAS ALREADY APPROVED.
THAT'S ALL I HAVE

[Captioner] 21:53:41
 TO SAY.

[Captioner] 21:53:44

>> Mayor Mei:   COUNCILMEMBER 
KASSAN.


[Captioner] 21:53:47
>> Councilmember Kassan:   YES, 
I FEEL THE NEED TO SAY SOMETHING 
THAT IS

[Captioner] 21:53:50
 VERY UNCOMFORTABLE TO ME 
TO SAY AND AWKWARD TO

[Captioner] 21:53:53
 SAY BUT I 
FEEL THE NEED TO SAY IT AND THAT 
IS, YOU KNOW,

[Captioner] 21:53:56
 SOMEONE POINTED 
OUT TO ME RECENTLY, JENNIE

[Captioner] 21:54:00
 
YOU'RE THE ONLY WHITE PERSON ON 
THE

[Captioner] 21:54:03
 FREMONT CITY COUNCIL, OH MY 
GOSH YOU'RE RIGHT.
I

[Captioner] 21:54:06
 COME FROM POSITION OF HUGE 
PRIVILEGE AS A WHITE

[Captioner] 21:54:09
 PERSON AND 
SO SOMETIMES I FEEL LIKE I NEED 
TO SAY CERTAIN THINGS

[Captioner] 21:54:13
 THAT, YOU 
KNOW, WHITE PEOPLE CAN'T BE 
QUIET

[Captioner] 21:54:16
 ABOUT THINGS THAT DON'T 
AFFECT THEM

[Captioner] 21:54:19
.
YOU KNOW, WE NEED TO DO OUR BEST 
TO SPEAK UP TO ADVOCATE

[Captioner] 21:54:22
 FOR 
THOSE WHO DON'T HAVE AS MUCH 
PRIVILEGE AS

[Captioner] 21:54:26
 WE DO.
AND I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT

[Captioner] 21:54:29
 I -- 
THERE IS AN ASPECT TO THIS THAT 
FEELS UN

[Captioner] 21:54:32
COMFORTABLE TO ME.
AND I KNOW THAT THERE'S A LOT OF 
REALLY GOOD

[Captioner] 21:54:35
 INTENTIONS AND 
WANTING TO INCLUDE PEOPLE.
BUT

[Captioner] 21:54:38
 THE FACT THAT

[Captioner] 21:54:41
 THIS IS COMING 
UP RIGHT AFTER WE HAD

[Captioner] 21:54:45
 THE 
REFERRAL

[Captioner] 21:54:50
 FROM COUNCILMEMBER COX 
TO RAISE THE FLAG FOR BLACK 
HISTORY

[Captioner] 21:54:54
 MONTH, IT HONESTLY MAKE 
MEES UNCOMFORTABLE

[Captioner] 21:55:01
 MAKES 
ME UNCOMFORTABLE.
IT IS RARE

[Captioner] 21:55:04
 THAT ANYONE COMES 
FORWARD REQUESTING THAT WE DO

[Captioner] 21:55:07
 A 
FLAG RAISING.
IT FEELS A

[Captioner] 21:55:11
 LITTLE BIT DIS

[Captioner] 21:55:17

DISRESPECTIVE, ON THE EVERYDAY 
THAT

[Captioner] 21:55:20
 COUNCILMEMBER COX MADE TO 
BRING THAT REFERRAL.
I'M SURE IT IS

[Captioner] 21:55:23
 NOT PROBABLY THE 
INTENTION BUT IT DOESN'T SEEM

[Captioner] 21:55:27
 
SUPERCOMFORTABLE TO ME THAT ALL 
OF A SUDDEN OUT OF THE BLUE 


[Captioner] 21:55:30
RIGHT AFTER A REFERRAL WAS MADE 
TO RAISE THE FLAG FOR BLACK

[Captioner] 21:55:33
 
HISTORY MONTH ALL OF A SUDDEN 
THERE IS THIS LONG LIST OF

[Captioner] 21:55:36
 
OTHERS THAT NOW WE NEED TO 
RECOGNIZE.


[Captioner] 21:55:39
AND I JUST, I THINK IT COULD BE 
SEEN

[Captioner] 21:55:42
 BY SOME OF THE MEMBERS OF 
OUR COMMUNITY

[Captioner] 21:55:45
 WHO ARE AFRICAN 
AMERICAN AS A BIT OF A 
DISRESPECTFUL ACT

[Captioner] 21:55:49
 TO ALL OF A 
SUDDEN SAY LIKE OH WELL WE HAD 
TWO

[Captioner] 21:55:52
 FLAG RAISINGS WELL NOW WE'RE 
GOING TO HAVE 21 BECAUSE

[Captioner] 21:55:55
 NOW 
THAT WE'RE RECOGNIZING BLACK 
HISTORY MONTH ALL OF A SUDDEN

[Captioner] 21:55:58
 WE 
HAVE TO RECOGNIZE A LOT MORE.
SO I'M NOT SAYING THAT

[Captioner] 21:56:01
 WAS THE 
INTENTION.
I'M NOT TRYING TO IMPUGN

[Captioner] 21:56:04
 ANYONE.
I JUST FEEL THE NEED TO BRING 
THIS UP IN CASE THERE ARE

[Captioner] 21:56:07
 ANY 
MEMBERS OF OUR BLACK COMMUNITY 
THAT FEEL THAT

[Captioner] 21:56:10
 THIS IS ISN'T THE 
BEST TIMING TO BE BRINGING THIS 
UP

[Captioner] 21:56:15
.
SO THAT'S IN ADDITION TO MY 
CONCERN

[Captioner] 21:56:18
 THAT THIS ISN'T REALLY A 
PRACTICAL THING

[Captioner] 21:56:21
 TO BE DOING 
RIGHT NOW GIVEN THE FACT THAT 
STAFF IS WORKING ON

[Captioner] 21:56:24
 A POLICY.
THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei:  

[Captioner] 21:56:27
 WELL I JUST 
WANTED TO CLARIFY THAT OVER THE 
YEARS AS MENTIONED

[Captioner] 21:56:31
, AND YOU'VE 
SEEN IN THE SURROUNDINGS CITIES 
AND I'VE

[Captioner] 21:56:34
 GOTTEN MANY 
CORRESPONDENCE

[Captioner] 21:56:39
S ASKING WHY WE 
HAVEN'T DONE IT FOR OTHER CITIES 
OR

[Captioner] 21:56:42
 OTHER MONTHS FROM WITHIN OUR 
COMMUNITIES.
BECAUSE I SEE MANY OF

[Captioner] 21:56:45
 OUR 
COMMUNITY MEMBERS ATTENDING IN 
OTHER CITIES AND THEY ASK

[Captioner] 21:56:48
 ME AT 
THAT POINT OFTEN WHY HAVE WE NOT

[Captioner] 21:56:51
 
DONE IT IN OURS.
SO IT IS NOT IN ISOLATION

[Captioner] 21:56:55
 ISOLATION BUT IN 
CONCERT BECAUSE WE SEE THE NEED 
TO BE ABLE

[Captioner] 21:56:58
 TO SUPPORT THIS.
AND SO I THINK IT'S JUST 
CREATING THAT

[Captioner] 21:57:01
 AWARENESS AND JUST 
TO CLARIFY THIS REFERRAL WAS 
ACTUALLY SUBMITTED

[Captioner] 21:57:04
 PRIOR TO THAT 
APPROVAL.
SO I HAD ACTUALLY SUBMITTED IT

[Captioner] 21:57:07
 
PRIOR TO THAT.
ALSO

[Captioner] 21:57:10
, COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN.

[Captioner] 21:57:15

>> Councilmember Salwan:   MADAM 
MAYOR --


[Captioner] 21:57:18
>> Mayor Mei:   YOU'RE ON MUTE.
>> Councilmember Salwan:   THERE 
WE GO.

[Captioner] 21:57:21

YEAH WELL I THINK WE HAVE A 
COUNCIL POLICY OF NOT

[Captioner] 21:57:24
 
QUESTIONING OTHER COUNCILMEMBERS 
MOTIVES, I THINK

[Captioner] 21:57:28
 THE INTENT BY 
BOTH MAYOR MEI

[Captioner] 21:57:31
 AS WELL AS 
COUNCILMEMBER COX IS GOOD.
I THINK WE'RE TRYING TO --

[Captioner] 21:57:35
 WE'RE 
A DIVERSE CITY.
WE LOVE EVERYBODY, WE WANT

[Captioner] 21:57:37
 TO BE 
INCLUSIVE.
SO I THINK THIS IS AN IMPORTANT 


[Captioner] 21:57:40
DISCUSSION TO HAVE.
I THINK WE'RE GETTING IN THE 
WEEDS AGAIN

[Captioner] 21:57:43
.
THIS IS SOMETHING COMING BEFORE 
US.


[Captioner] 21:57:46
WE DON'T HAVE TO FIGHT FOR EACH 
DAY RIGHT NOW.

[Captioner] 21:57:49

WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A RETREAT.
WE CAN

[Captioner] 21:57:52
 DISCUSS THIS FURTHER.
AT THIS POINT I THINK WE SHOULD 
HAVE A ROBUST

[Captioner] 21:57:55
 DISCUSSION IN 
LONGER SETTING WHERE IT HAS BEEN

[Captioner] 21:57:59
 
PROPERLY AGENDIZED, STAFF SET 
REVIEW

[Captioner] 21:58:02
, REVIEW THE OTHER 
POLICIES

[Captioner] 21:58:05
 FROM OTHER COUNTIES 
CITIES AND THEN WE CAN HAVE A

[Captioner] 21:58:09
 
COMPREHENSIVE DISCUSSION.
WE'RE NOT APPROVING 19 DAYS

[Captioner] 21:58:11
 OR 
21 DAYS ALL WE'RE DOING IS THESE 
ARE SOME OF THE DAYS

[Captioner] 21:58:14
 THAT MAYOR 
MEI IS INTERESTED IN LOOKING AT.
WE MAY

[Captioner] 21:58:18
 HAVE OTHER DAYS, I MAY 
HAVE DAYS, YOU

[Captioner] 21:58:21
 GUYS MAY HAVE 
OTHER DAYS.
WE CAN HAVE THIS DISCUSSION

[Captioner] 21:58:24
 IN A 
MORE INFORMAL SETTING.
THIS IS A COUNCIL REFERRAL

[Captioner] 21:58:27
, WE 
DON'T HAVE TO TAKE POSITIONS AT 
THIS POINT OTHER THAN TO SAY

[Captioner] 21:58:30
 YES 
WE WOULD LIKE TO STUDY THE FLAG 
RAISING ISSUE AND WE

[Captioner] 21:58:33
 WOULD BE 
OPEN TO HAVING A DISCUSSION ON 
THE DEDICATES

[Captioner] 21:58:37
, DAYS PROPOSED BY 
MAYOR MEI AND

[Captioner] 21:58:40
 OTHER 
COUNCILMEMBERS HAVE THE RIGHT TO 
ADD OTHER DAYS OR HAVE A 


[Captioner] 21:58:43
DISCUSSION BY REMOVING SOME OF 
THESE DAYS.
I THINK THIS IS A

[Captioner] 21:58:47
 HEALTHY 
DISCUSSION AND BEGIN THIS COULD 
BE HELD AT A

[Captioner] 21:58:50
 COUNCIL RETREAT 
WHICH IS ONLY NEXT MONTH.
SO I THINK

[Captioner] 21:58:53
 IN THE INTERESTS OF 
MOVING THIS FORWARD AGAIN I'D 
LIKE TO PROPOSE A

[Captioner] 21:58:56
 MOTION TO MOVE 
THIS FORWARD AND SEE IF I GET A 
SECOND SO WE

[Captioner] 21:58:59
 CAN PLUG THIS 
ALONG.
>> Councilmember Shao:   I 


[Captioner] 21:59:02
SECOND.
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU, 
COUNCILMEMBER COX

[Captioner] 21:59:05
 DID YOU PRESS 
THE BUTTON AGAIN?

[Captioner] 21:59:08

>> Councilmember Cox:   I'VE 
BEEN WAITING FOR A LONG TIME TO 


[Captioner] 21:59:11
SPEAK AND OTHERS HAVE SPOKEN 
QUITE A FEW

[Captioner] 21:59:14
 TIMES BETWEEN.
BUT I JUST WANTED TO -- WE GOT 
TO TAKE A

[Captioner] 21:59:17
 STEP BACK HERE IN 
TERMS OF LISTENING TO WHAT

[Captioner] 21:59:20
 OUR 
CITY MANAGER IS SAYING WITH THE 
STAFFING.


[Captioner] 21:59:23
AND WE TOOK ACTION LAST MONTH 
WHICH WE ALL AGREED

[Captioner] 21:59:26
 TO MAKE SURE 
THAT WE DO HAVE A STAFFING 
POLICY.


[Captioner] 21:59:29
I THINK WE HAVE THE CHICKEN AND 
THE EGG HERE THAT

[Captioner] 21:59:33
 HOW CAN YOU 
HAVE THIS LIST WHEN YOU DON'T 
EVEN

[Captioner] 21:59:36
 KNOW WHAT THE POLICY IS 
SAYING.
AND

[Captioner] 21:59:40
 WHAT IS SETTING FORTH WHAT 
WOULD BE SOME OF THE

[Captioner] 21:59:43
 FLAG 
RAISING STANDARDS IN POLICY

[Captioner] 21:59:46
 AND 
PROCEDURE BEFORE WE START 
LOOKING AT

[Captioner] 21:59:50
 LIST OF FLAG RAISING.
BUT THEN ON THE OTHER

[Captioner] 21:59:53
 SIDE, I 
REMEMBER GOING THROUGH THE 
EXHAUST

[Captioner] 21:59:56
IVE LIST OF LISTING 
PROBABLY 30 OR

[Captioner] 21:59:59
 40 CULTURAL 
CELEBRATIONS THAT WE DO IN A 
PROCLAMATION

[Captioner] 22:00:02
 AND THAT HAS TO BE 
CONSIDERED TOO BECAUSE WE CAN'T 
JUST DO

[Captioner] 22:00:06
 FLAG RAISING.
BECAUSE SOME OF THESE FLAG 
RAISING

[Captioner] 22:00:08
 DON'T EVEN HAVE 
PROCLAMATIONS.
I MEAN THE ONE FOR

[Captioner] 22:00:12
 FRED KAMSUTO 
HE WAS JUST

[Captioner] 22:00:15
 RECOGNIZED BY 
GOVERNOR NEWSOM BACK ON JANUARY 
30th OF

[Captioner] 22:00:19
 2022 AND IT IS ONLY 
THREE OTHER STATES THAT

[Captioner] 22:00:22
 
CELEBRATE HIM.
SO WE GOT TO LOOK AT THINGS AS A 


[Captioner] 22:00:25
WHOLE OF HOW WE HAVE A VISION 
AND LOOKING AT

[Captioner] 22:00:28
 HOW THE 
PROCLAMATION AND HOW THE FLAG 
RAISING

[Captioner] 22:00:32
 MATCHING UP THEN ALSO 
LOOKING AT THE STAFFING.
DO

[Captioner] 22:00:35
 WE EVEN HAVE STAFFING.
DO YOU WANT TO PULL STAFFING OFF

[Captioner] 22:00:38
 
TO DO FLAG RAISING

[Captioner] 22:00:41
 VERSUS CODE 
ENFORCEMENT OR SOME OTHER

[Captioner] 22:00:45
 CORE 
SERVICES THAT WOULD BE SERVICING 
OUR RESIDENTS RIGHT NOW.


[Captioner] 22:00:48
SO I REALLY THINK THAT WE

[Captioner] 22:00:51
 SHOULD 
PUT THIS, ALONG WITH A 
DISCUSSION AT

[Captioner] 22:00:54
 OUR CITY COUNCIL 
RETREAT, BUT

[Captioner] 22:00:57
 ALSO, I THINK WE 
CAN'T MOVE FORWARD ON SOMETHING 
THAT'S NOT

[Captioner] 22:01:01
 COMPLETE.
WE GOT TO SEE THE WHOLE PICTURE.
AND SO

[Captioner] 22:01:04
 I REALLY WOULD NOT BE 
ABLE TO SUPPORT THIS BECAUSE

[Captioner] 22:01:07
 
IT'S MISSING INFORMATION THAT 
SHOULD BE COMING FROM CITY

[Captioner] 22:01:11
 
STAFF.
TO DIRECT US ON SUGGESTIONS AND 


[Captioner] 22:01:14
RECOMMENDATIONS.
AND MAYBE CIRCLING BACK TO GET

[Captioner] 22:01:17
 
INPUT FROM THE HUMAN RESOURCE 
COMMISSION.


[Captioner] 22:01:20
I JUST THINK THAT WE'RE JUMPING 
INTO SOMETHING AND WHEN

[Captioner] 22:01:23
 YOU ARE 
LOOKING AT 21 CULTURAL 
CELEBRATIONS, YOU'RE

[Captioner] 22:01:26
 LOOKING AT 
MORE THAN, YOU KNOW, TWO A MONTH 
ALMOST

[Captioner] 22:01:29
.
ONE A MONTH, TWO A MONTH.


[Captioner] 22:01:32
SO WE GOT TO BE REALISTIC ABOUT 
THIS AND

[Captioner] 22:01:35
 NOT JUMPING IN WITHOUT 
HAVING A SET POLICY

[Captioner] 22:01:39
 FIRST HAVING 
AN OPEN DISCUSSION, MAPPING IT 
OUT WHERE DOES ALL

[Captioner] 22:01:43
 THESE 
CELEBRATIONS LINE UP.
AND BEFORE WE CAN

[Captioner] 22:01:46
 MAKE ANY FINAL 
DECISIONS TONIGHT, THAT'S

[Captioner] 22:01:49
 MY 
RECOMMENDATION.
I CAN'T OPERATE WITH HALF OF AN

[Captioner] 22:01:52
 
INFORMATION WHEN WE KNOW THERE'S 
SOME MORE INFORMATION STILT

[Captioner] 22:01:54
 
COMING.
>> Mayor Mei:   COUNCILMEMBER 


[Captioner] 22:01:57
KENG.
>> Vice Mayor Keng:   THANK YOU 
MAYOR.

[Captioner] 22:02:01

SO I THINK THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN 
A MISUNDERSTANDING OF

[Captioner] 22:02:04
 WHAT WE 
VOTED ON PREVIOUSLY

[Captioner] 22:02:07
 ABOUT 
DIRECTING STAFF TO HAVE A FLAG 
RAISING

[Captioner] 22:02:10
 POLICY.
I THINK THAT ALSO INCLUDED 
HAVING

[Captioner] 22:02:14
 STAFF RECOMMEND OTHER 
OCCASIONS THAT WE WANT THAT

[Captioner] 22:02:17
 WE 
COULD POTENTIALLY

[Captioner] 22:02:21
.
>> MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE 
DIRECTION WAS THAT STAFF WOULD 


[Captioner] 22:02:24
BE COMING BACK WITH A POLICY

[Captioner] 22:02:27
 
FRAMEWORK BY WHICH YOU ALL

[Captioner] 22:02:30
 COULD 
DECIDE WHICH DAYS

[Captioner] 22:02:34
, EVENTS OR 
WHATEVER, YOU'D BE INTERESTED

[Captioner] 22:02:37
 
THIS RAISING A FLAG FOR.
SO FOR EXAMPLE,

[Captioner] 22:02:40
 THE POLICY

[Captioner] 22:02:43
 MAY 
INFORM YOU TO RAISE A FLAG FOR 
ONE

[Captioner] 22:02:46
 OF THE DAYS THAT ARE LISTED

[Captioner] 22:02:50
 
IN MAYOR MEI'S REFERRAL.
BUT IT MAY NOT

[Captioner] 22:02:53
.
SO IF YOU WERE TO VOTE ON THIS 
LIST, RIGHT

[Captioner] 22:02:56
 NOW, THAT

[Captioner] 22:03:00
 WOULD -- 
THAT WOULD ADD SOME COMPLEXITIES

[Captioner] 22:03:04
 
TO THE WORK THAT STAFF WOULD 
NEED TO DO IN TERMS OF 


[Captioner] 22:03:07
DEVELOPING A COMPREHENSIVE 
POLICY FOR YOU.
BUT YES SO AT A WAS MY 


[Captioner] 22:03:10
UNDERSTANDING.
WHAT'S ENTAILED IN FLAG RAISING

[Captioner] 22:03:13
, 
WHAT ARE THE PARAMETERS THAT,

[Captioner] 22:03:16
 
SOME PROGRAM TERSE THAT COULD BE 
PLACED AROUND IT.


[Captioner] 22:03:19
SO THAT YOU DON'T HAVE OTHER 
PEOPLE COMING

[Captioner] 22:03:22
 AND ASKING YOU TO 
RAISE A FLAG FOR SOMETHING THAT 
YOU MAY NOT

[Captioner] 22:03:25
 WANT TO OR YOU MAY 
FIND DISTASTE

[Captioner] 22:03:28
FUL.
SO THAT WAS MY UNDERSTANDING OF 
THE DIRECTION

[Captioner] 22:03:32
.
>> Vice Mayor Keng:   THANK YOU.
SO I THINK, YOU KNOW, ONCE WE 


[Captioner] 22:03:36
HAVE THAT FLAG POLICY OR 
STRUCTURE THEN WE CAN

[Captioner] 22:03:40
 HAVE AN -- 
ALSO UNDERSTANDING THE STAFFING 
ABILITY AND RESOURCES

[Captioner] 22:03:44
, THEN WE 
ARE ABLE TO BETTER DETERMINE HOW 
MANY WE'RE

[Captioner] 22:03:47
 DOING AND WHAT WE CAN 
DO TOGETHER.
SO

[Captioner] 22:03:50
 I THINK IT'S A LITTLE 
PREMATURE BECAUSE

[Captioner] 22:03:55
 IT -- WHEN 
WE'RE VOTING ON THESE

[Captioner] 22:03:58
 19 FLAG 
RAISINGS THAT WOULD REALLY

[Captioner] 22:04:01
 
CONFUSE THE STRUCTURE

[Captioner] 22:04:04
 HOW TO I 
THINK THAT WOULD BE VERY

[Captioner] 22:04:08
 TAXING 
FOR THE STAFF TO DID ALL OF 
THESE KIND OF BECAUSE

[Captioner] 22:04:11
 THEY 
ALREADY STARTED THAT

[Captioner] 22:04:14
 POLICY, 
PROCEDURE, SO NOW THAT WE'RE

[Captioner] 22:04:19
 
THROWING THESE AT THEM AND SAY 
YOU DON'T HAVE TO PICK

[Captioner] 22:04:22
 THEM ALL, 
I THINK IT'S VERY KIND

[Captioner] 22:04:25
 OF 
MISLEADING FOR THE STAFF.
OF WHAT

[Captioner] 22:04:29
 WE VOTED ON EARLIER.
>> Mayor Mei:   WELL ONCE WE

[Captioner] 22:04:32
 
STARTED WITH RAISING THE PRIDE 
FLAG I THINK WE COULD

[Captioner] 22:04:35
 HAVE AT 
THAT TIME PROBABLY STARTED 
CRAFTING A

[Captioner] 22:04:38
 POLICY BECAUSE THAT 
WAS PRECEDENT-SETTING BECAUSE IT

[Captioner] 22:04:42
 
WAS SOMETHING WE WERE VERY PROUD 
OF BECAUSE PRIOR TO

[Captioner] 22:04:45
 THAT WE ONLY 
HAD THE FLAG FLYING AT THE

[Captioner] 22:04:48
 DAIS 
AND WE STARTED THAT A FEW YEARS 
AGO, THAT

[Captioner] 22:04:51
 WE RAISED THE FLAG OUT 
AT THE FLAG POLE AT

[Captioner] 22:04:55
 WHICH POINT 
WE STARTED THE PROCESS IN 
LOOKING AT THIS AND BY ADD

[Captioner] 22:04:58
ING 
THIS AND ACTUALLY LIKE I SAID 
OVER THE YEARS I HAVE HAD

[Captioner] 22:05:01
 MANY 
QUESTIONS ABOUT DIFFERENT GROUPS 
COMING TO ME,

[Captioner] 22:05:04
 ASKING ME WHY WE 
HAVEN'T DONE SO FOR THEM.
AND SO I'M

[Captioner] 22:05:07
 TRYING TO MAKE SURE 
THAT FROM THE

[Captioner] 22:05:10
 PERSPECTIVE I AM 
AMIABLE

[Captioner] 22:05:14
 TO COUNCILMEMBER 
SALWAN'S PROPOSAL NOT 
NECESSARILY TO LIST

[Captioner] 22:05:17
 THE DATES 
BUT TO BE THOUGHTFUL IN MAKING 
SURE THAT WE ARE INCLUSIVE

[Captioner] 22:05:22
 AND 
SET THE POLICY BECAUSE WHEN THE 
POLICY WAS

[Captioner] 22:05:25
 LAST TIME TO HAVE A 
FLAG RAISING POLICY BUT NOT

[Captioner] 22:05:27
 
NECESSARILY WHICH DATES WE WERE 
TO INCLUDE.


[Captioner] 22:05:30
SO I WANTED TO BE MORE 
INCLUSIVE.

[Captioner] 22:05:34

SO COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL.


[Captioner] 22:05:38
>> Councilmember Campbell:  

[Captioner] 22:05:42
 I 
THINK I'M KIND OF CONFUSED BUT I 
THINK I'M GETTING

[Captioner] 22:05:45
 IT.
WHAT WE WOULD

[Captioner] 22:05:48
 REALLY LIKE TO DO 
IS HAVE A DRAFT POLICY COME 
BEFORE

[Captioner] 22:05:51
 US, I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO 
SUPPORT THIS TONIGHT ANYWAY

[Captioner] 22:05:55
 
BECAUSE I'M NOT IN

[Captioner] 22:05:57
 TOTAL 
AGREEMENT OF ALL OF THESE DAYS 
ON HERE.


[Captioner] 22:06:00
I MEAN PARTICULARLY AS IT 
RELATES

[Captioner] 22:06:03
 TO INDIVIDUAL PEOPLE AND 
THE PRECEDENT THAT

[Captioner] 22:06:06
 THAT MIGHT 
SET FOR US.
I THINK WE'LL BE GOING DOWN

[Captioner] 22:06:09
 A 
SLIPPERY SLOPE.
SO I

[Captioner] 22:06:13
 THINK THAT THE STAFF WOULD 
REALITY

[Captioner] 22:06:16
 LIKE A CLEAR DIRECTION 
ON

[Captioner] 22:06:20
 WHERE THE COUNCIL WOULD LIKE 
FOR THEM TO

[Captioner] 22:06:23
 GO WITH THIS.
ARE YOU GIVEN

[Captioner] 22:06:26
 GIVING THEM THE FREEDOM 
TO DECIDE

[Captioner] 22:06:29
 IRRESPECTIVE OF THIS 
LIST WHAT A POLICY WOULD LOOK 
LIKE

[Captioner] 22:06:32
?
OR ARE YOU SAYING, INCLUDE SOME 
OF THESE

[Captioner] 22:06:36
 DATES IN THE POLICY, 
AND BRING THAT

[Captioner] 22:06:39
 BACK TO US?
I JUST DON'T -- I'M NOT

[Captioner] 22:06:43
 CLEAR ON --
>> Mayor Mei:   SURE

[Captioner] 22:06:46
.
>> Councilmember Campbell:   HOW 
THIS REFERRAL IMPACTS

[Captioner] 22:06:49
 THE -- 
THEIR ABILITY TO COME UP WITH

[Captioner] 22:06:53
 A 
CLEAN SLATE OF A POLICY

[Captioner] 22:06:56
 THAT 
DOESN'T INCLUDE ANY DAYS, TIMES, 
WEEKS

[Captioner] 22:06:59
 OR MONTHS.
>> Mayor Mei:   WELL I THINK 
THAT WE HAD ASKED

[Captioner] 22:07:02
 AND DIRECTED 
STAFF THAT THEY COME UP WITH A 
FLAG RAISING

[Captioner] 22:07:05
 POLICY.
I THINK THAT -- I APPRECIATE 
YOUR RECOMMENDATION THAT

[Captioner] 22:07:09
 IF IT'S 
TOO ONEROUS BASED OFF 
INDIVIDUALS

[Captioner] 22:07:12
 THAT WE LOOK AT 
MONTHS.
BUT I THINK

[Captioner] 22:07:15
 IT'S IMPORTANT THAT 
WE HAVE A CONSISTENT POLICY THAT 
WE IMPLEMENT SO

[Captioner] 22:07:18
 THAT PEOPLE DO 
FEEL INCLUDED.
SO IF WE'RE

[Captioner] 22:07:21
 GOING TO START WITH 
A POLICY OF FLAG RAISING BY 
MONTH,

[Captioner] 22:07:25
 I THINK NOT THAT WE ARE 
PUTTING ONEROUS ON THE

[Captioner] 22:07:28
 PEOPLE 
HONORING THIS, ORIGINALLY WHEN 
WE TALKED ABOUT IT FOR

[Captioner] 22:07:31
 BLACK 
HISTORY MONTH I BELIEVE WE SAID 
THAT IT WOULD

[Captioner] 22:07:34
 NOT BE SOMETHING 
THAT WE AS A CITY WERE PUTTING 
ADDITIONAL RESOURCE

[Captioner] 22:07:37
S TO.
IT WOULD BE A CEREMONIAL EVENT 
BUT WE AS A

[Captioner] 22:07:40
 CITY WERE NOT 
PUTTING ADDITIONAL STAFFING OR

[Captioner] 22:07:44
 
RESOURCES OR TENTS OR

[Captioner] 22:07:47
 ANYTHING 
SPECIFICALLY TO.
SO THAT WAS MY UNDERSTANDING, IT 


[Captioner] 22:07:50
WAS MEANT TO BE CEREMONIAL IN 
THAT SENSE AND THAT IF WE ARE 
GOING TO DO

[Captioner] 22:07:53
 SOMETHING WITH CITY 
FUNDING IN FAIRNESS WE WOULD 
KEEP IT CONSISTENT

[Captioner] 22:07:56
 WITH ALL THE 
OTHER DATES.
SO I THINK THAT WOULD BE 


[Captioner] 22:08:01
EQUITABLE.

[Captioner] 22:08:07

COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN AGAIN.

[Captioner] 22:08:13

>> Councilmember Salwan:   THANK 
YOU, MADAM MAYOR.


[Captioner] 22:08:16
AT THIS POINT I DON'T THINK WE 
ARE PROPOSING

[Captioner] 22:08:19
 ANY STAFFING OR 
EXPENSES TO BE MADE BY THE CITY 
ON

[Captioner] 22:08:23
 BEHALF ANYONE.
I THINK MY MOTION IS WE DON'T 
HAVE TO

[Captioner] 22:08:26
 ACCEPT ALL 19 DAYS, ALL 
I'M SAYING IS

[Captioner] 22:08:29
 WE LOOK AT AN 
INCLUSIVE POLICY

[Captioner] 22:08:33
 THAT 
INCORPORATES SEVERAL DIFFERENT 
DATES THAT

[Captioner] 22:08:36
 MAY INCLUDE THIS LIST 
AND THERE MAY BE OTHERS THAT WE

[Captioner] 22:08:39
 
MAY HAVE.

[Captioner] 22:08:44

BUT THIS MAY BE IN THE TRAIL 
WORK OF THE

[Captioner] 22:08:47
 FLAG POLICY.
WE HAVE THE FLAG FOLLOW, WE HAVE

[Captioner] 22:08:51
 
THE MARTIN LUTHER KING DAY, 
BLACK HISTORY FLAG,

[Captioner] 22:08:54
 AND WE ALSO 
LOOK AT OTHER DAYS.
I THINK THAT WOULD

[Captioner] 22:08:58
 PROBABLY 
SATISFACTORY EVERYBODY AND WE 
CAN MOVE

[Captioner] 22:09:02
 THIS FORWARD.
WE'RE NOT COMMITTING TO

[Captioner] 22:09:05
 ANY 
PARTICULAR -- MY MOTION IS NOT 
TO

[Captioner] 22:09:08
 MOVE 19 DAYS FORWARD.
THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M

[Captioner] 22:09:11
 SAYING.
ALL I'M SAYING IS, THAT WE LOOK 
AT

[Captioner] 22:09:14
 THE SPIRIT OF THE REFERRAL 
WHICH IS TO

[Captioner] 22:09:17
 HAVE INCLUSIVENESS 
WITHIN OUR COMMUNITY.

[Captioner] 22:09:20

SO GET ALL MARGINALIZED GROUPS 
ALL

[Captioner] 22:09:24
 VARIOUS FOLKS IN ALL 
CAPACITIES TO BE REPRESENTED.
AND

[Captioner] 22:09:27
, YOU KNOW, AS COUNCIL WE ARE 
THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE 
PUBLIC.


[Captioner] 22:09:30
AND SO I THINK THAT DISCUSSION 
NEEDS TO BE

[Captioner] 22:09:34
 HAD IN THAT 
FRAMEWORK AND ALSO AS FAR AS 
COST

[Captioner] 22:09:37
 I DON'T THINK WE HAVE TO 
COMMIT ZERO DOLLARS.
IF A

[Captioner] 22:09:40
 GROUP WANTS TO HAVE A FLAG 
RAISING, THEY SHOULD RAISE

[Captioner] 22:09:43
 THE 
FUNDS, YOU KNOW, AND THEY SHOULD 
ORGANIZE EVERYTHING AND THEY

[Captioner] 22:09:46
 
SHOULD PAY FOR STAFF COST AND 
ALL OF THAT STUFF.


[Captioner] 22:09:49
BUT AGAIN I THINK IT'S PREMATURE 
FOR US TO BE DISCUSS

[Captioner] 22:09:52
ING STAFFING 
OR ANYTHING.
THIS IS JUST A REFERRAL FROM

[Captioner] 22:09:55
 A 
COUNCILMEMBER.
IT REQUIRES NO OTHER STAFF

[Captioner] 22:09:59
 TIME 
OTHER THAN INCLUDING THESE 19

[Captioner] 22:10:02
 
DAYS AND MAYBE THERE'S OTHERS 
THAT YOU GUYS CAN

[Captioner] 22:10:06
 MENTION 
OFFLINE AND WE CAN HAVE THIS 
DISCUSSION AT THE

[Captioner] 22:10:09
 RETREAT.
WE CAN HAVE -- BREAK UP

[Captioner] 22:10:12
 IN SMALL 
GROUPS, WE CAN DECIDE WHICH DAYS

[Captioner] 22:10:15
 
WE LIKE, WHAT OUR THINKING IS 
COME BACK TOGETHER AND THEN WE 


[Captioner] 22:10:18
CAN DECIDE THAT THESE ARE THE 
ONES WE WANT TO GO FORWARD.

[Captioner] 22:10:21

SO I DON'T THINK IT'S, YOU KNOW, 
A WIN OR LOSS, IT

[Captioner] 22:10:24
 SAYS WE'RE ALL 
TRYING TO HAVE THIS DISCUSSION.
THIS IS A HEALTHY DISCUSSION

[Captioner] 22:10:27
.
I THINK WE NEED MORE PROPOSE 
TIME TO DID

[Captioner] 22:10:31
 THAT.
WE ALSO NEED A LOT OF STAFF TIME 
TO WORK ON THIS

[Captioner] 22:10:34
 AND MAYBE STAFF 
MAY HAVE FEEDBACK, YOU KNOW, WHY 
CERTAIN

[Captioner] 22:10:37
 DAYS MIGHT NOT BE GOOD.
WHY SOME CITIES

[Captioner] 22:10:42
 AVOID RELIGIONS 
OR CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS.


[Captioner] 22:10:45
AND SO

[Captioner] 22:10:49
 THAT'S, I'D LIKE TO HEAR 
FROM THE

[Captioner] 22:10:53
 CITY MANAGER IS THIS 
SOMETHING THAT IS DOABLE OR WHAT 
IS

[Captioner] 22:10:56
 YOUR --
>> Karena Shackelford:  

[Captioner] 22:10:59
 EXACTLY 
WHAT IS TOO MUCH TO DO, ADDING 
THE

[Captioner] 22:11:02
 19 DAYS HERE OR DRAFTING THE 
POLICY?
>> Councilmember Salwan:  

[Captioner] 22:11:06
 ONE 
IS DRAFTING THE POLICY.
>> Karena Shackelford: 

[Captioner] 22:11:09
  THAT IS 
ALREADY IN PROGRESS, WE'VE GOT 
SOME

[Captioner] 22:11:12
 GOOD EXAMPLES FROM OTHER 
CITIES AND WE'LL BE COMING BACK

[Captioner] 22:11:15
 
TO YOU WITH THAT IN PRETTY SHORT 
ORDER.


[Captioner] 22:11:18
AS FAR AS ADDING ANY DAYS RIGHT 
NOW OR ADDING ANY DAYS

[Captioner] 22:11:21
 PERIOD, 
THE STAFF TIME

[Captioner] 22:11:24
 THAT'S INVOLVED 
RIGHT NOW WITH ANY OF

[Captioner] 22:11:27
 THE 
SPECIALTY DAY FLAG RAISINGS, IT

[Captioner] 22:11:30
 
DOES REQUIRE A STAFF PERSON TO 
COME OUT AND

[Captioner] 22:11:34
 LOWER THE FLAGS 
THAT ARE THERE, ADD THIS ONE.

[Captioner] 22:11:37

SO SOMEBODY IS GOING TO HAVE TO 
DO SOMETHING EVEN IF

[Captioner] 22:11:40
 WE DON'T DO 
ALL OF THE CEREMONIAL THINGS AN 
IT

[Captioner] 22:11:44
.
THAT MAYBE SOME OTHER CITIES DO.
>> Councilmember Salwan:  

[Captioner] 22:11:47
 SO IS 
STAFF WILLING TO HAVE A 
DISCUSSION ABOUT SOME POTENTIAL 


[Captioner] 22:11:50
DATES OR MAYBE WE CAN LIMIT THE 
NUMBER OF DATES OR IS THAT 
SOMETHING

[Captioner] 22:11:53
 THAT WE COULD HAVE A 
DISCUSSION ON?

[Captioner] 22:11:54

>> Karena Shackelford:   
ABSOLUTELY.


[Captioner] 22:11:57
AND AS I ENVISIONED HOW WE WOULD

[Captioner] 22:12:01
 
APPROACH

[Captioner] 22:12:04
 PRESENTING YOU WITH 
SOME OPTIONS THAT KIND OF 
INFORMATION WOULD BE CLUB

[Captioner] 22:12:07
.
SO WE WOULDN'T NECESSARILY BE 
RECOMMENDING ANY DATES

[Captioner] 22:12:10
.
WE'LL SHARE WITH YOU WHAT WE'VE 
LEARNED WITH

[Captioner] 22:12:13
 OTHER CITIES, SOME 
OF WHICH YOU'VE INCLUDED IN YOUR 
DISCUSSION TODAY

[Captioner] 22:12:17
 WITH THE FOCUS 
ON DEI AND MAKING SURE

[Captioner] 22:12:20
 WE'RE 
INCLUSIVE AND LOOKING AT MAYBE 
SOME THINGS THAT ARE SPECIAL TO

[Captioner] 22:12:23
 
FREMONT.
SO OUR INTENTION WAS

[Captioner] 22:12:26
 TO COME 
BACK WITH SOMETHING THAT IS 
COMPREHENSIVE FOR YOU TO

[Captioner] 22:12:30
 
CONSIDER, AND TO, YOU KNOW, 
MAYBE YOU THE

[Captioner] 22:12:33
 WANTED ALLOW

[Captioner] 22:12:36
 OTHER 
MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO ASK FOR 
FLAG RAISE

[Captioner] 22:12:39
INGS OR THINGS OF THAT 
NATURE.
SO THE DISCUSSION TODAY

[Captioner] 22:12:42
 WAS 
HELPFUL AND IT'S ADDED TO THE 
WAY WE'RE

[Captioner] 22:12:45
 APPROACHING IT.
>> Mayor Mei:   I THINK THAT THE 
TIMING

[Captioner] 22:12:49
 IS APT, BECAUSE IF WE ARE 
GOING TO BE

[Captioner] 22:12:52
 DEVELOPING A POLICY 
TO HAVE THIS HEARTY DISCUSSION

[Captioner] 22:12:55
 
IN PUBLIC IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE 
PEOPLE CAN HEAR THE

[Captioner] 22:12:59
 THOUGHTS OF 
THE COUNCIL AND SOMETIMES WITH 
THE

[Captioner] 22:13:02
 RETREAT NOT EVERYONE FOLLOWS 
THIS.
THIS ALLOWS THE CLARITY FOR

[Captioner] 22:13:05
 
PEOPLE WHO ASKED AND AGAIN 
PERHAPS NOT

[Captioner] 22:13:08
 EVERY INDIVIDUAL ON 
THE COUNCIL HAS HEARD THIS TYPE 
OF REQUEST AND

[Captioner] 22:13:11
 I MIGHT GET MORE 
SO BECAUSE I'M ATTENDING SOME

[Captioner] 22:13:14
 OF 
THESE EVENTS AND

[Captioner] 22:13:18
 THEY CORNER ME 
AND ASK ME.
I APPRECIATE THE THOUGHTFULNESS

[Captioner] 22:13:21
 
TO APPLY AND BE ABLE TO HAVE 
THIS CONVERSATION IN A MANNER

[Captioner] 22:13:24
 
THAT ALLOWS US THEN AT THE 
RETREAT TO SAY, YOU KNOW,

[Captioner] 22:13:27
 HERE'S 
WHAT WE'VE AGREED TO HERE'S WHAT 
WE'VE

[Captioner] 22:13:30
 LOOKED AT IN OTHER CITIES 
AND THAT IN

[Captioner] 22:13:33
 SINCERITY I THINK 
THAT TWO

[Captioner] 22:13:36
 WOULD BE RESTRICTIVE, 
20 MAY BE TOO MUCH BUT THEN HOW 
DO

[Captioner] 22:13:40
 WE FIND THE BALANCE AND 
LOOKING AT THE POLICY?
AND AGAIN

[Captioner] 22:13:43
 I APPRECIATE 
SPECIFICALLY IF THE CITY MANAGER 
DOES TALK ABOUT USE

[Captioner] 22:13:46
 JUST LIKE OUR 
HOUSING ELEMENT TODAY WE DID

[Captioner] 22:13:49
 AN 
ANALYSIS OF THE COMMUNITY, OF 
THE COMMUNITY'S

[Captioner] 22:13:53
 NEEDS AND BASIS 
IN TERMS OF THE DIVERSITY

[Captioner] 22:13:55
 AND 
EQUITY.
THEREFORE THAT WOULD BE A GOOD 


[Captioner] 22:13:59
FOUNDATIONAL DISCUSSION POINT.
SORRY I SEE

[Captioner] 22:14:02
 AGAIN COUNCILMEMBER 
SHAO AND COUNCILMEMBER COX.
LOOKING THROUGH

[Captioner] 22:14:05
 THE LIST.
YAS THANK YOU MAYOR,

[Captioner] 22:14:09
 AS A 
REMINDER ARE WE GOING TO ALLOW 
SPEAKERS TO SPEAK ON THIS ISSUE

[Captioner] 22:14:12
?
>> Mayor Mei:   NO HANDS UP.
>> Councilmember Shao:   THANK 


[Captioner] 22:14:15
YOU.
SO THANK YOU,

[Captioner] 22:14:19
 COUNCILMEMBER 
SALWAN FOR THE CLARIFICATION

[Captioner] 22:14:22
 
WHEN NOT VOTING ON THE 19 DAYS 
TO BE CLEAR.


[Captioner] 22:14:25
WE'RE NOT VOTING ON THE 19 DAYS, 
RATHER

[Captioner] 22:14:28
 WE WANT TO VOTE ON

[Captioner] 22:14:32
 BEING 
INCLUSIVE OR NOT.
SO IF THE

[Captioner] 22:14:36
 LANGUAGE, YOU KNOW,

[Captioner] 22:14:40
 IS 
SLIGHT EXCHANGE, FOR EXAMPLE, 
YOU KNOW, GIVING

[Captioner] 22:14:44
 THE FLEXIBILITY 
THAT SOME OF THE 19

[Captioner] 22:14:47
 DAYS OR 
DATES ARE

[Captioner] 22:14:51
 GOING TO BE EXCLUDED 
IN THE FUTURE

[Captioner] 22:14:54
, THEN I STILL 
THINK THAT IS

[Captioner] 22:14:58
 THE TECHNICALITY 
THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO CLING ON

[Captioner] 22:15:02
.
WE'RE VOTING ON WHETHER WE WANT 
TO BE INCLUSIVE ON

[Captioner] 22:15:05
 OR NOT.
THAT'S HOW I SEE THIS REFERRAL

[Captioner] 22:15:10
.
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado:   
THROUGH THE MAYOR IF I MAY, JUST 


[Captioner] 22:15:14
A LEGAL OBSERVATION IF I MAY.

[Captioner] 22:15:19

IF THE COUNCIL IS DESIROUS TO 
HEAD IN THE

[Captioner] 22:15:23
 DIRECTION THAT 
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN IS 
SUGGESTING, I WOULD OFFER

[Captioner] 22:15:26
 THAT 
NO ACTION IS REALLY NECESSARY.
THE COUNCIL HAS ALREADY DIRECTED

[Captioner] 22:15:29
 
STAFF TO DEVELOP A FOLLOW.
WE'RE GOING TO COME BACK WITH 


[Captioner] 22:15:33
THAT.
THE DIRECTION THAT YOU CAN GIVE 
IS THAT AS PART OF THAT 


[Captioner] 22:15:36
DISCUSSION WE'LL HAVE A 
COMPREHENSIVE DISCUSSION THAT 
INCLUDES POTENTIALLY

[Captioner] 22:15:39
 THESE 
DATES.
THEREFORE, YOU WOULDN'T REALLY 


[Captioner] 22:15:42
NEED A MOTION NECESSARILY TO DO 
THAT.
IF YOU

[Captioner] 22:15:45
 HAVE CONSENSUS, THAT 
WOULD BE SUFFICIENT AND THEN 
WE'D BRING

[Captioner] 22:15:49
 BACK A COMPREHENSIVE 
DISCUSSION AT A FUTURE DATE.
>> Mayor Mei: 

[Captioner] 22:15:52
  I'D LIKE TO HAVE 
SOME TIME TRAIL ON THE DATE 
THOUGH.


[Captioner] 22:15:55
I THINK WITH THE REFERRALS I 
WOULD LIKE TO KNOW

[Captioner] 22:15:58
 LIKE WHAT -- 
IS IT DURING THE RETREAT THAT WE 
WILL HAVE

[Captioner] 22:16:01
 THIS CONVERSATION 
ALONG WITH THE POLICY?
BECAUSE I THINK IT

[Captioner] 22:16:05
 WOULD BE 
CENTRALIZED IN THE SENSE OF 
HAVING THE PROCLAMATION

[Captioner] 22:16:08
 AS WELL 
AS FLAG RAISING OR IT WOULD BE 
LIKE A FUTURE MEETING TWO

[Captioner] 22:16:11
, THREE 
MONTHS, FOUR MONTHS, FIVE MONTHS

[Captioner] 22:16:14
 
OUT.

[Captioner] 22:16:19

>> Karena Shackelford:   PLEASE 
ALLOW ME TO RESPOND IN THIS WAY.


[Captioner] 22:16:22
HEARING THE DISCUSSION TODAY AND 
THE DISCUSSION

[Captioner] 22:16:25
 BACK IN DECEMBER, 
STAFF HAS ALREADY BEGAN GATHER

[Captioner] 22:16:29

GATHERING INFORMATION AND 
WORKING ON A

[Captioner] 22:16:32
 POLICY TO BRING 
BACK TO YOU.
SO THE URGENCY

[Captioner] 22:16:35
 OF IT IS 
UNDERSTOOD.
YOU KNOW, I CAN'T

[Captioner] 22:16:38
 GIVE YOU AN 
EXACT DATE RIGHT NOW BUT I

[Captioner] 22:16:41
 DO 
UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S THE DESIRE 
OF THE COUNCIL TO HAVE IT IN 


[Captioner] 22:16:45
FRONT OF YOU SOONER RATHER THAN 
LATER AND TO

[Captioner] 22:16:48
 ALSO BE ABLE TO 
HAVE A DISCUSSION ABOUT IT AT 
THE RETREAT IN

[Captioner] 22:16:51
 FEBRUARY.
>> Mayor Mei:   SO GREAT, 
FEBRUARY THAT WOULD BE

[Captioner] 22:16:54
 GREAT, 
THANK YOU SO MUCH.


[Captioner] 22:17:00
COUNCILMEMBER COX AGAIN.
>> Councilmember Cox:   YES.
I APPRECIATE

[Captioner] 22:17:03
 YOUR COMMENTS

[Captioner] 22:17:06
 CITY 
MANAGER SHACKELFORD.
AND AS THE POLICY IS BEING 


[Captioner] 22:17:09
DEVELOPED IT WOULD BE HELPFUL IF 
YOU COULD

[Captioner] 22:17:13
, YOU KNOW, ARTICULATE 
THE MONTHS WHERE

[Captioner] 22:17:17
 THE 
PROCLAMATION AND WHERE FLAG 
RAISING IS KIND OF BEING

[Captioner] 22:17:20
 
PREDICTED AND ESTIMATED.
SO WE CAN KIND OF GET A FULL

[Captioner] 22:17:23
 
PICTURE OF ALL OF THAT BUT ALSO 
BASED ON YOUR RESEARCH

[Captioner] 22:17:26
 TALKING 
WITH OTHER LOCAL GOVERNMENTS, IT

[Captioner] 22:17:29
 
WOULD BE GREAT TO SEE WHO OTHERS

[Captioner] 22:17:33
 
CELEBRATE.
AND ON SOME SORT OF

[Captioner] 22:17:36
 FASHION.
BECAUSE SOME COULD BE MORE OR 
LESS OR DIFFERENT.

[Captioner] 22:17:40

BUT IT'S ALSO DEPENDING ON THE 
POPULATION AND SOME

[Captioner] 22:17:43
 GO WITH THE 
TOP, YOU KNOW, TOP TEN,

[Captioner] 22:17:46
 YOU 
KNOW, I DON'T KNOW, OF WHAT 
REPRESENTS

[Captioner] 22:17:50
 THEIR PARTICULAR

[Captioner] 22:17:53
, 
GRAPHICS OF THE CITY

[Captioner] 22:17:56
 POPULATION.
BUT THAT TOO WOULD BE SOME 
HELPFUL

[Captioner] 22:17:59
 INFORMATION TO PROVIDE 
GUIDANCE IN THAT REGARD

[Captioner] 22:18:02
.
YOU KNOW, BECAUSE WE'RE 
BASICALLY LOOK

[Captioner] 22:18:05
ING AT A GUIDELINE 
OF HOW WE'RE GOING TO CARRY

[Captioner] 22:18:08
 
SOMETHING LIKE THIS OUT BUT 
THERE'S GOT TO BE THINGS

[Captioner] 22:18:12
 THAT, 
YOU KNOW, PROHIBITED THAT IT'S 
NOT GOING TO BE

[Captioner] 22:18:15
, EITHER YOU 
APPLY AS A NONPROFIT WITH THE 
GRANTS OR

[Captioner] 22:18:18
 YOU COME WITH YOUR OWN 
FUNDRAISING OR, YOU KNOW,

[Captioner] 22:18:21
 OTHER 
WAYS THAT OTHERS

[Captioner] 22:18:24
 CANNOT MAKE IT 
SO BURDENSOME ON THE CITY

[Captioner] 22:18:28
 STAFF 
AND OUR CITY RESOURCES.
AND LIKE THE BUDGET

[Captioner] 22:18:30
.
>> Karena Shackelford:   RIGHT, 
I APPRECIATE THAT.


[Captioner] 22:18:33
SO JUST TO BE CLEAR WHAT YOU 
WON'T SEE

[Captioner] 22:18:36
 ARE RECOMMENDED DATES 
THERE STAFF OR

[Captioner] 22:18:41
 RECOMMENDED, YOU 
KNOW,

[Captioner] 22:18:44
 CULTURAL MONTHS OR 
INDIVIDUALS OR WHATEVER

[Captioner] 22:18:48
.
BUT WHAT YOU WILL SEE

[Captioner] 22:18:51
 TO USE 
COUNCILMEMBER SHAO'S TRAYS,

[Captioner] 22:18:54
 
COUNCILMEMBER SHAO'S PHRASE

[Captioner] 22:18:57
, 
TREKS, OAKLAND DOES THIS.


[Captioner] 22:19:01
FOR EXAMPLE, THIS OTHER CITY HAS 
DO.
SO SOME OPTIONS

[Captioner] 22:19:04
 FOR YOU TO 
CONSIDER AS OPPOSED TO STAFF 
SAYING, HERE'S

[Captioner] 22:19:07
 THE LAUNDRY LIST 
OF DATES OR MONTHS THAT

[Captioner] 22:19:10
 YOU 
SHOULD CONSIDER.
THE POLICY WILL BE INTENDED

[Captioner] 22:19:14
 TO 
ALLOW YOU ALL TO MAKE DECISIONS

[Captioner] 22:19:17
 
ABOUT WHO AND WHAT YOU WANT

[Captioner] 22:19:21
 TO 
CELEBRATE AND/OR RAISE A FLAG 
FOR.

[Captioner] 22:19:24

>> Councilmember Cox:   OKAY.

[Captioner] 22:19:27

>> Karena Shackelford:   AND IT 
WILL INCLUDE ALL OF

[Captioner] 22:19:31
S TO 
GENERALITIES THAT YOU MENTIONED.
AND ONCE IT COMES

[Captioner] 22:19:34
 BEFORE YOU, IF 
IT IS NOT COMPREHENSIVE

[Captioner] 22:19:36
 ENOUGH, 
YOU CAN ASK US TO DO A LITTLE 
MORE WORK.


[Captioner] 22:19:39
BUT I THINK WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING 
FOR WE UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS

[Captioner] 22:19:42
 
THAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR AND 
WE'RE PREPARED TO BRING THAT 


[Captioner] 22:19:45
BACK.
>> Councilmember Cox:   BECAUSE 
I REMEMBER BACK I THINK IT WAS 


[Captioner] 22:19:49
THIS PAST SEPTEMBER THAT WE HAD 
GONE THROUGH THE EXHAUST

[Captioner] 22:19:52
IVE 
LIST, I KNOW I WENT THROUGH 
LISTING EVERY

[Captioner] 22:19:55
 SINGLE THING THAT 
COULD BE POSSIBLE AS 
PROCLAMATIONS BUT THEN SIT

[Captioner] 22:19:58
 
REALLY REALISTIC AND HOW DOES 
THAT MATCH UP WITH

[Captioner] 22:20:01
 FLAG RAISING.
AND I GET AN IDEA,

[Captioner] 22:20:05
 I KNOW IT IS 
SUGGESTED AND FOR EXAMPLE, BUT 
IT JUST HELPS

[Captioner] 22:20:08
 US TO HAVE A PLAN 
OR VISION SO WE CAN UNDERSTAND 
WHERE

[Captioner] 22:20:11
 THINGS LINE UP AS WE TRY 
TO MAKE SOME DECISIONS GOING 
INTO

[Captioner] 22:20:14
 THAT.
AND WILL THERE BE ENOUGH TIME TO 
TALK ABOUT

[Captioner] 22:20:17
 THAT PARTICULAR AREA 
AS PART

[Captioner] 22:20:21
 OF THE UPCOMING RETREAT.
THAT'S THE OTHER PART BECAUSE I

[Captioner] 22:20:24
 
KNOW WE HAVE A LOT OF OTHER 
PRIORITIES TO SET AND MOVE

[Captioner] 22:20:28
 
FORWARD FOR 2023.
SO THAT'S MY OTHER CONCERN TOO,

[Captioner] 22:20:31
 
IS JUST THE AMOUNT OF TIME THAT 
IT CAN TAKE

[Captioner] 22:20:34
 TO KIND OF REACH 
THROUGH THAT AS WE'VE

[Captioner] 22:20:37
 BEEN 
DISCUSSING THAT FOR ALMOST A 
LONG TIME NOW.

[Captioner] 22:20:41

SO I'M JUST TRYING TO BE 
REALISTIC HERE AS WE'RE TRYING

[Captioner] 22:20:44
 
TO SET UP AND TRYING TO GET THE 
END RESULTS AND

[Captioner] 22:20:47
 BE PRODUCTIVE AT 
THE UPCOMING MEETING IN

[Captioner] 22:20:51
 FEBRUARY 
FOROUR RYE TREAT

[Captioner] 22:20:54
 
FOR OUR RETREAT

[Captioner] 22:20:57
.
I'M A PERSON WOULD LIKES 
PLANNING, LIKES

[Captioner] 22:21:00
 TO SEE THINGS AS 
CLEAR AS WE CAN BEFORE WE MAKE 
DECISIONS

[Captioner] 22:21:03
.
AND I JUST DON'T FEEL I CAN

[Captioner] 22:21:06
 
SUPPORT SOMETHING LIKE THIS 
WITHOUT THE POLICY THE FRAMEWORK

[Captioner] 22:21:09
 
OF HOW WE'RE GOING TO DO IT 
FIRST AND THEN SEEING HOW THAT

[Captioner] 22:21:13
 
MATCHES INTO WHAT'S THE REALITY 
OF THE FRAMEWORK OF LOOKING

[Captioner] 22:21:16
 AT 
THE REALITY OF THE FRAMEWORK AND

[Captioner] 22:21:20
 
HOW DOES IT IMPLEMENT INTO 
ROLLING OUT AND DOING

[Captioner] 22:21:22
 THE ACTUAL 
CULTURAL CELEBRATION.
SO THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 22:21:28
>> Mayor Mei:   COUNCILMEMBER 
KENG.
>> Vice Mayor Keng:   THANK YOU 


[Captioner] 22:21:31
MAYOR.
AND I THINK EARLIER

[Captioner] 22:21:34
, CITY 
MANAGER SHACKELFORD MENTION

[Captioner] 22:21:37
ED 
ABOUT TAKING COMMUNITY REQUESTS 
FOR FLAG RAISING.

[Captioner] 22:21:40

AND I THINK THAT SHOULD NOT BE 
AN OPTION

[Captioner] 22:21:44
.
BECAUSE THAT WOULD JUST OPEN

[Captioner] 22:21:48
 THE -- YEAH, THE GATE TOO WIDE.
AND I THINK

[Captioner] 22:21:51
 EARLIER MAYOR WAS 
TALKING ABOUT

[Captioner] 22:21:54
 INVITING A 
COMMUNITY

[Captioner] 22:21:57
 GROUP TO BE PART OF

[Captioner] 22:22:01
 
OUR ORGANIZED FLAG RAISING, ONE

[Captioner] 22:22:04
, 
ONCE WE DECIDE THIS IS AN 
IMPORTANT EVENT TO HAVE,

[Captioner] 22:22:07
 SO 
INSTEAD OF LIKE

[Captioner] 22:22:11
 ONCE WE DECIDE 
ON THIS LIST AND OTHER PEOPLE 
CAN ALSO

[Captioner] 22:22:14
 REQUEST AND I THINK 
THAT WOULD BE TOO MUCH AND

[Captioner] 22:22:17
 ALSO 
BE KIND OF -- DEFEAT

[Captioner] 22:22:20
 THE PURPOSE 
OF DECIDING A LIST

[Captioner] 22:22:22
.
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado:   
THROUGH THE MAYOR TO THAT VERY 


[Captioner] 22:22:26
POINT I THINK THAT'S PART OF THE 
REASON WHY IT'S IMPORTANT TO

[Captioner] 22:22:28
 
ALLOW STAFF TO FINISH A DRAFT OF 
A POLICY.


[Captioner] 22:22:31
BECAUSE THERE HAS BEEN RECENT 
SUPREME COURT

[Captioner] 22:22:35
 CASE LAW ON THIS 
ISSUE.
>> Mayor Mei:   I SEE

[Captioner] 22:22:38
 THAT.
RFERLTD WOE WOO

[Captioner] 22:22:41
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado:   WE

[Captioner] 22:22:45
 
WOULD LOVE TO PROVIDE YOU THIS,

[Captioner] 22:22:48
 
WHOSE SPEECH THIS IS GOING TO 
BE, GOVERNMENT SPEECH VIA

[Captioner] 22:22:51
 CITY 
COUNCIL OR WHETHER THIS IS A 
PUBLIC YOU ARE

[Captioner] 22:22:54
 FORUM THAT YOU 
WOULD ASK

[Captioner] 22:22:58
 ANY PERSON TO HAVE 
DISCUSSION.

[Captioner] 22:23:01

WE'RE OPEN TO THAT AT A FUTURE 
DATE.


[Captioner] 22:23:04
>> Mayor Mei:   I THINK CURRENT 
POLICIES ARE

[Captioner] 22:23:07
 REFLECTIVE, TODAY 
WHILE IT'S A LONGER CONVERSATION 
IS

[Captioner] 22:23:10
 A HEARTY CONVERSATION JUST 
LIKE LAST TIME AND I THINK

[Captioner] 22:23:13
 THAT 
AS YOU'RE TRAILING HAD AND DOING 
THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

[Captioner] 22:23:16
 OF 
THE POLICY IT IS A GOOD TIME FOR 
US TO BE ABLE TO

[Captioner] 22:23:19
 EXPLORE ALL 
THESE AND FROM THE PUBLIC'S

[Captioner] 22:23:21
 
PERSPECTIVE IT IS A CONVERSATION 
THAT WAS HELD TODAY SO THAT 


[Captioner] 22:23:25
EVERYONE CAN SEE THE DIFFERENT 
PERSPECTIVES OF THE 
COUNCILMEMBERS

[Captioner] 22:23:28
 AND UNDERSTAND 
THEIR POSITIONING

[Captioner] 22:23:30
.
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN.
>> Councilmember Kassan:   I 


[Captioner] 22:23:33
WOULD LIKE TO REQUEST IN 
ACCORDANCE WITH THE 
RECOMMENDATION MADE BY

[Captioner] 22:23:37
 THE CITY 
ATTORNEY THAT WE MOVE ON TO THE 
NEXT AGENDA ITEM

[Captioner] 22:23:41
.

[Captioner] 22:23:47

>> Mayor Mei:   I THINK THAT IF 
THE STAFF HAS

[Captioner] 22:23:50
 THE UNDERSTANDING 
OF WHAT THE POLICY IS OR WHAT 
THE REFERRAL THAT I WAS

[Captioner] 22:23:54
 ASKING 
FOR, NOT NECESSARILY THE DATES, 
AND THAT

[Captioner] 22:23:57
 WE WILL SEE THAT 
REFLECTED IN THE POLICY OR

[Captioner] 22:24:00
 THE 
STUDY THAT'S RETURNED, I'M 
SUPPORTIVE OF

[Captioner] 22:24:03
 THAT IDEA.
BUT I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE 
THAT WE DID

[Captioner] 22:24:06
 HAVE THIS 
CONVERSATION.
BECAUSE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT

[Captioner] 22:24:10
 
FOR THE PUBLIC TO HEAR.


[Captioner] 22:24:15
SO IS THAT SOMETHING

[Captioner] 22:24:18
 --
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado:   I 
UNDERSTOOD THAT AS PART OF THE

[Captioner] 22:24:21
 
POLICY DISCUSSION WE WILL BRING 
BACK THE SEDATES HERE FOR 


[Captioner] 22:24:25
FURTHER CONSIDERATION AND 
CONSIDERATION BY THE COUNCIL.

[Captioner] 22:24:28

>> Mayor Mei:   FROM MY 
PERSPECTIVE I JUST WANT TO MAKE 


[Captioner] 22:24:31
SURE WE ARE OPEN TO THAT IDEA, 
BECAUSE WHEN WE CRAFT

[Captioner] 22:24:34
 THE POLICY 
THAT ALLOWS US THAT OPPORTUNITY.
>> Councilmember Cox:   I GUESS

[Captioner] 22:24:38
 
I'M GETTING CONFUSED.
BECAUSE REALLY THE REFERRAL WAS

[Captioner] 22:24:41
 
BACK ON DECEMBER 20th TO TAKE 
ACTION NOT TO CHANGE ANYTHING.


[Captioner] 22:24:44
BECAUSE IF WE ACCEPT WHAT IT IS 
TONIGHT I

[Captioner] 22:24:47
 WOULD ASSUME WE ARE 
ACCEPTING AS WRITTEN WHAT'S 
ADDED ON

[Captioner] 22:24:50
 TO WHAT WE DECIDE ON 
DECEMBER 20th.
