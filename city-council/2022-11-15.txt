[Captioner] 19:25:44
 DIRECTOR KIM.
WE ARE RETURNING TO YOU AFTER
COUNCIL DIRECTION TO COME BACK


[Captioner] 19:25:48
AND REWORK SPECIFIC ISSUES ON
THE LEASE AGREEMENT AT MISSION
PEAK FOR

[Captioner] 19:25:50
 THE STANFORD STAGING
AREA.
THERE IS A LONG-STANDING HISTORY


[Captioner] 19:25:54
OF PRESERVING OUR OPEN HILLSIDES
FOR RECREATION AND OPEN SPACE.


[Captioner] 19:25:58
FREMONT CAN BE PROUD FOR THE


[Captioner] 19:26:02
PAST 44 YEARS, THE CITY AND  EAST
BAY REGIONAL

[Captioner] 19:26:05
 PARKS HAVE HAD AN
AGREEMENT TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO
THE

[Captioner] 19:26:08
 HILLSIDES THAT PROVIDE
AMAZING RECREATION AND TRAIL
AMENITIES.


[Captioner] 19:26:11
WHAT IS BEFORE YOU TODAY IS A
LEASE AGREEMENT THAT RESPONDS TO
YOUR DIRECTION.


[Captioner] 19:26:14
CURRENTLY WE ARE LEASING
900 ACRES ON A MONTH-TO-MONTH


[Captioner] 19:26:17
BASIS TO EAST BAY REGIONAL PARKDISTRICT.


[Captioner] 19:26:21
THE DISTRICT SPENDS
APPROXIMATELY $450,000

[Captioner] 19:26:25
 PER YEAR
TO MAINTAIN TRAILS, CREATE
SETBACKS,

[Captioner] 19:26:28
 MANAGE THE STANFORD
STAGING AREA, MANAGE OPEN

[Captioner] 19:26:31
 SPACE,
PROVIDE FOR JANITORIAL AND DAILY
CLEANING,

[Captioner] 19:26:34
 LITTER AND TRASH,
VOLUNTEER DAYS, MAINTAIN

[Captioner] 19:26:38
 THE 43
PARKING SPACES, AS WELL AS
PROVIDE FOR

[Captioner] 19:26:41
 RANGER AND POLICE
PATROLS.
THE NATIONAL

[Captioner] 19:26:45
 RECREATION PARKS
ASSOCIATION, THE INDUSTRY LEADER
IN COST

[Captioner] 19:26:48
 MODELING, INDICATED IN
2014 THE COST OF NATURAL

[Captioner] 19:26:52
 SPACE
MAINTENANCE ON THE LOW END

[Captioner] 19:26:55
 IS
$1,100 TO $1,300 PER ACRE.
WHICH

[Captioner] 19:26:58
 WOULD EQUATE TO A MILLION
DOLLARS COST FOR THE CITY

[Captioner] 19:27:02
 TO
OPERATE ANNUALLY.
THE CITY DOES NOT HAVE

[Captioner] 19:27:05
 ANY
GENERAL FUND RESOURCES ALLOCATED
TO OPERATE AND

[Captioner] 19:27:09
 MAINTAIN THE
SITE.
OUR MAINTENANCE STAFF ARE

[Captioner] 19:27:13
 NOT
OPEN SPACE EXPERTS, AND WE CALL
UPON EAST BAY

[Captioner] 19:27:16
 REGIONAL PARK
DISTRICT WHEN WE HAVE OPEN
SPACE-RELATED

[Captioner] 19:27:19
 ISSUES.
SINCE 2016, WE CREATED

[Captioner] 19:27:22
 THE
MISSION PEAK PERMIT PARKING
PROGRAM AS SHOWN IN THE

[Captioner] 19:27:25
 LOWER
HALF OF THIS PICTURE.
IT HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL

[Captioner] 19:27:29
 WITH
APPROXIMATELY 150 SPACES
PROVIDED FOR PARK VISITORS

[Captioner] 19:27:32
 AS
SHOWN IN THE BLUE AREAS.
THE PERMIT PARKING

[Captioner] 19:27:35
 IS OUTSIDE OF
THE LEASE AREA THAT IS BEFORE
YOU

[Captioner] 19:27:38
 TODAY, AND IS MANAGED BY THE
CITY OF FREMONT'S POLICE
DEPARTMENT.


[Captioner] 19:27:42
DUE TO THE SUCCESS OF THE PERMIT
PARKING PROGRAM,

[Captioner] 19:27:46
 THE POLICE
DEPARTMENT PLANS TO RECOMMEND A
CONTINUATION OF THE

[Captioner] 19:27:49
 PERMIT
PARKING PROGRAM SCHEDULED TO
EXPIRE ON

[Captioner] 19:27:53
 JULY 7TH, 2023, AT A
FUTURE CITY COUNCIL MEETING OVER
THE NEXT FEW MONTHS.


[Captioner] 19:28:03
WE ALSO WANTED TO SHARE WITH YOU
THE LARGER CONTEXT IN

[Captioner] 19:28:05
 WHICH WE
WORKED WITH EAST BAY REGIONAL
PARKS.


[Captioner] 19:28:09
THERE ARE SEVEN REGIONAL PARKS
OPERATED BY EAST BAY REGIONAL
PARKS

[Captioner] 19:28:12
 IN FREMONT.
AND IT IS THESE PARKS THAT ADD
SO MUCH TO THE

[Captioner] 19:28:16
 LIVABILITY AND
BEAUTY OF FREMONT.
EAST

[Captioner] 19:28:19
 BAY REGIONAL PARKS ALSO
OPERATES ARDENWOOD PARK

[Captioner] 19:28:21
 FOR THE
CITY OF FREMONT.
WE HAVE AN EVEN SMALLER


[Captioner] 19:28:24
AGREEMENT SUCH AS THE OPERATION
OF THE PIT TOILET AT SABERCAT
REGIONAL

[Captioner] 19:28:27
 PARK SINCE EAST BAY
COULD OFFER US A REDUCED PRICE
OVER THE

[Captioner] 19:28:30
 MARKET COST BY ALLOWING
US TO UTILIZE THEIR IN-HOUSE
SANITATION

[Captioner] 19:28:34
 SERVICES.
WITH THAT, I'M GOING TO INVITE
MY

[Captioner] 19:28:37
 COLLEAGUE, JIM O'CONNOR FROM
EAST BAY REGIONAL PARKS, TO
SHARE A LITTLE BIT

[Captioner] 19:28:40
 MORE ABOUT
THE PROPOSED LEASE AGREEMENT.


[Captioner] 19:28:44
>> GOOD EVENING, MADAME MAYOR
AND MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL.


[Captioner] 19:28:48
JIM O'CONNOR.
I'M THE DEPUTY GENERAL MANAGER
WITH EAST BAY REGIONAL

[Captioner] 19:28:51
 PARKS.
AND THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME AN
OPPORTUNITY TO

[Captioner] 19:28:55
 SPEAK TONIGHT ON


[Captioner] 19:28:58
THIS ITEM.
AS MS. WOLF HAS STATED, THE


[Captioner] 19:29:01
DISTRICT CURRENTLY OPERATES
SEVEN PARKS WITHIN THE CITY OF


[Captioner] 19:29:05
FREMONT.
THE COST OF OPERATING THESE
PARKS

[Captioner] 19:29:09
 EXCEEDS $6 MILLION, AND WE
HAVE HAD A PARTNERSHIP WITH THE
CITY OF FREMONT

[Captioner] 19:29:12
 FOR 44 YEARS.


[Captioner] 19:29:16
OPERATING THESE PARKS, WE DO NOT
ASK FOR ANY CONTRIBUTION BEYOND
THE

[Captioner] 19:29:21
 TAXPAYERS' PARCEL TAX THAT
WE COLLECT EVERY

[Captioner] 19:29:25
 YEAR.
AND I'M HERE TO SAY THAT WE ARE
WILLING

[Captioner] 19:29:28
 TO CONTINUE THAT
PARTNERSHIP HERE

[Captioner] 19:29:31
 AT SANFORD
AVENUE.
AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK


[Captioner] 19:29:35
TOGETHER WITH YOUR STAFF AS I
HAVE FOR THE

[Captioner] 19:29:38
 LAST 11 YEARS TO
ADDRESS SOME OF THE ISSUES OF
THE NEIGHBORS,

[Captioner] 19:29:43
 AND TO MAKE THIS
AN IMPORTANT ASSET FOR THE
COMMUNITY AND THE REGION BEYOND.


[Captioner] 19:29:46
SO I'M HERE IF YOU HAVE ANY
EXTRA QUESTIONS, AND I'LL PASS
IT BACK

[Captioner] 19:29:50
 TO SUZANNE.
>>

[Captioner] 19:29:53
 THANK YOU.
ON THE NEXT

[Captioner] 19:29:58
 SLIDE, WE'LL SHARE
IN FINER DETAIL A LITTLE BIT
MORE ABOUT THE

[Captioner] 19:30:01
 RELATIONSHIP
HERE, AS THERE ARE 3,023 ACRES
OF MISSION

[Captioner] 19:30:04
 PEAK REGIONAL
PRESERVE.
THE STANFORD AVENUE

[Captioner] 19:30:07
 ENTRANCE AND
OPEN SPACE REPRESENTS ABOUT 900
OF THE

[Captioner] 19:30:11
 3,000 ACRES, WHICH IS
APPROXIMATELY

[Captioner] 19:30:14
 30% OF THE LAND
AREA OF MISSION PEAK.


[Captioner] 19:30:18
THIS LEASE DOES NOT COVER OHLONE
COLLEGE NOR THEIR PUBLIC PARKING
LOT.


[Captioner] 19:30:21
THIS AREA IS COVERED BY A
SEPARATE AGREEMENT WITH EAST BAY
REGIONAL PARKS

[Captioner] 19:30:25
 AND OHLONE
COLLEGE.
WE

[Captioner] 19:30:28
 ARE PARTNERS IN DISCUSSING
THE OPPORTUNITIES AT THIS SITE
AND SIT AT THE TABLE

[Captioner] 19:30:30
 WITH OHLONE
COLLEGE AND EAST BAY REGIONAL
PARK DISTRICT.


[Captioner] 19:30:34
WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH
THE NEW INTERIM PRESIDENT,


[Captioner] 19:30:37
DR. DESALVO, ON CREATING A MORE
INVITING ENTRANCE

[Captioner] 19:30:39
 TO MISSION
PEAK FROM THE OHLONE COLLEGE
ENTRANCE.


[Captioner] 19:30:43
THIS COVERS THE 900 ACRES AT
STANFORD STAGING

[Captioner] 19:30:46
 AREA.
IF WE ASSUMED OPERATIONAL
RESPONSIBILITY OF THE

[Captioner] 19:30:49
 900 ACRES,
EAST BAY REGIONAL PARKS WOULD
STILL RECEIVE TAX DOLLARS

[Captioner] 19:30:52
 TO
OPERATE AND MANAGE THE REMAINING


[Captioner] 19:30:55
2100 ACRES THAT GOES FROM OHLONE
COLLEGE TO THE

[Captioner] 19:30:58
 MILPITAS ENTRANCE
AT LEVINE PARK AND THE SUNOL
ENTRANCE.


[Captioner] 19:31:02
THE CITY RECEIVES NO TAX DOLLARS
TO OPERATE THIS

[Captioner] 19:31:05
 SITE.
SO ALL RESOURCES REQUIRED TO
OPERATE

[Captioner] 19:31:08
 THIS SITE ANNUALLY WOULD
NEED TO COME FROM THE GENERAL


[Captioner] 19:31:12
FUND.
AND AS THE CITY COUNCIL IS
AWARE, THE PARKS DIVISION AND


[Captioner] 19:31:15
PARK RANGERS ARE MINIMALLY
STAFFED AND OPERATING

[Captioner] 19:31:18
 OUR LOCAL
AND COMMUNITY PARKS.


[Captioner] 19:31:25
THE CRITICAL ITEMS YOU DIRECTED
US TO REVIEW AT MISSION PEAK


[Captioner] 19:31:28
INCLUDED:  CHANGING THE DAYS OF
APPROVAL FROM 30 DAYS TO 60

[Captioner] 19:31:31
 FOR
SMALL PROJECTS SUCH AS FIXING
FENCES OR TRAILS THAT ARE BROKEN


[Captioner] 19:31:34
OR

[Captioner] 19:31:41
 DAMAGED, TO 120 DAYS FOR
IMPROVEMENTS THAT REQUIRE
PERMITS.


[Captioner] 19:31:44
AND THE ABILITY TO ACCEPT OR
REJECT ALL CAPITAL

[Captioner] 19:31:49
 PROJECTS.
IN THE AGREEMENT, WE CONTINUE TO
IDENTIFY OHLONE COLLEGE AS

[Captioner] 19:31:52
 THE
PRIMARY SITE AND ENTRANCE TO
MISSION PEAK.


[Captioner] 19:31:55
IT DOES NOT MEAN THAT STANFORD
STAGING AREA ISN'T IDENTIFIED,
BUT

[Captioner] 19:31:59
 CUSTOMERS BETTER UNDERSTAND
THAT THERE ARE LIMITED PARKING
OPTIONS AND

[Captioner] 19:32:02
 OFTEN NO PARKING ON
BUSY WEEKENDS.
NEITHER

[Captioner] 19:32:05
 AGENCY SUPPORTS CHARGING
PARKING FEES AT THE STANFORD
STAGING

[Captioner] 19:32:08
 AREA.
WE HAVE LEARNED IN OTHER PARK
AREAS, NEIGHBORHOOD AND BUSINESS


[Captioner] 19:32:11
AREAS ARE IMPACTED WITH MORE
CARS SEEKING OUT THE FREE


[Captioner] 19:32:16
PARKING.
IN OUR PROFESSIONAL OPINION,
THIS WILL ONLY ADD MORE DRIVING


[Captioner] 19:32:19
TIME IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD, AND
MAY ADD CONGESTION IN THIS

[Captioner] 19:32:22
 AREA.


[Captioner] 19:32:26
EAST BAY REGIONAL PARKS HAS THE
NEED FOR

[Captioner] 19:32:29
 EXCLUSIVE OPERATIONAL
CONTROL OF THE SITE.
THIS IS SO IMPORTANT SINCE WE


[Captioner] 19:32:32
HAVE NO RESOURCES TO PROVIDE TO
THE SITE.


[Captioner] 19:32:36
THEY NEED TO BE IN CHARGE OF ALL
ASPECTS OF THE PARK FROM


[Captioner] 19:32:39
EMPLOYEES, CONTRACTORS,
MAINTENANCE, TRAIL

[Captioner] 19:32:43
 MANAGEMENT,
AND ANY EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT
NEEDED.


[Captioner] 19:32:46
AS THE SIGN SHOWS, THERE ARE NOW
PERMANENT HOURS LISTED IN

[Captioner] 19:32:49
 THE
AGREEMENT THAT ARE POSTED AT THE
ENTRANCE TO THE STANFORD STAGING


[Captioner] 19:32:53
AREA.
WE'VE BEEN WORKING A LOT THIS
PAST YEAR TO ACCOMPLISH SOME OF


[Captioner] 19:32:56
THESE GOALS.
IN ADDITION, THEY HAVE AN
ELECTRONIC BOARD

[Captioner] 19:33:00
 THAT STATES,
PARK CURFEW IS FROM 9:00 P.M.

[Captioner] 19:33:03
 TO
6:30 A.M., AND THAT VISITORS ARE
SUBJECT TO

[Captioner] 19:33:06
 A $300 FINE IF ON
SITE DURING THOSE CURFEW

[Captioner] 19:33:11
 HOURS.
THEY ALSO INSTALLED A PERMANENT
SIGN ON

[Captioner] 19:33:14
 MISSION BOULEVARD NEAR
OHLONE COLLEGE TO DIRECT
VISITORS TO PARK AT

[Captioner] 19:33:17
 OHLONE
COLLEGE.


[Captioner] 19:33:21
EAST BAY REGIONAL PARK DISTRICT
PROVIDES POLICE AND FIRE AT THE
SAME LEVEL

[Captioner] 19:33:24
 AT OTHER EAST BAY
REGIONAL PARK SITES.
WITH ONLY 10 STAFF ON

[Captioner] 19:33:27
 THE FIRE
DEPARTMENT, THE CITY IS THE
FIRST RESPONDER FOR FIRE-RELATED


[Captioner] 19:33:30
CALLS FOR SERVICE.
EAST BAY REGIONAL PARK

[Captioner] 19:33:34
 PROVIDES
PATROL OF THE LEASED AREA


[Captioner] 19:33:37
INCLUDING THE PARKING
LOTS 43 SPACES AND CURFEW HOURS.


[Captioner] 19:33:40
THE CITY PROVIDES PATROL IN THE
NEIGHBORHOOD AND THE PERMIT
PARKING

[Captioner] 19:33:43
 AREA AND WITHIN THE CITY
LIMITS.


[Captioner] 19:33:47
DEPUTY CHIEF IS AVAILABLE TO
SPEAK TO THE CALLS FOR SERVICE
FOR PATROL, AS WELL

[Captioner] 19:33:50
 AS WHAT HAS
WORKED IN THE LAST YEAR.


[Captioner] 19:33:54
WE WERE ALSO DIRECTED TO COME
BACK WITH SPECIFIC LANGUAGE FOR
THE ROAD CLOSURE

[Captioner] 19:33:57
 ISSUE.
WE AGREED UPON ROAD CLOSURE
LANGUAGE SO THAT IF THE

[Captioner] 19:34:00
 CITY
EXERCISES ITS POLICE POWERS AND


[Captioner] 19:34:03
CLOSES THE STREET FOR MORE THAN
24 HOURS, THEN THE CITY

[Captioner] 19:34:06
 WILL
TEMPORARILY ASSUME THE
OPERATIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES FOR


[Captioner] 19:34:10
THE STANFORD STAGING AREA UNTIL
THE CONCLUSION OF THAT STREET


[Captioner] 19:34:14
CLOSURE.
THE STREET CLOSURES THAT TRIGGER
THE CHANGE IN RESPONSIBILITIES


[Captioner] 19:34:17
DOES NOT INCLUDE STREET CLOSURES
FOR CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION

[Captioner] 19:34:21
 OR
FIRE

[Captioner] 19:34:25
 SUPPRESSION.
THE LEASE CAN STILL BE
TERMINATED

[Captioner] 19:34:28
 WITHIN 90 DAYS OF THE
BREACH OR WITHIN 30 DAYS OF
WRITTEN NOTICE.


[Captioner] 19:34:31
WE HAVE UPDATED THE INDEMNITY
AND

[Captioner] 19:34:34
 NON-DISCRIMINATION LANGUAGE.
WE RECOMMEND A 20-YEAR LEASE
AGREEMENT.


[Captioner] 19:34:37
AS WE HAVE RECEIVED A SIGNED
LETTER THAT IS GOOD FOR

[Captioner] 19:34:40
 THE
LENGTH OF THE LEASE.
THE SIDE LETTER

[Captioner] 19:34:43
 THAT YOU'VE
RECEIVED IN YOUR PACKET THIS
AFTERNOON INDICATES THAT EAST


[Captioner] 19:34:46
BAY REGIONAL PARK DISTRICT WILL
NOT ALLOCATE FUNDING FOR

[Captioner] 19:34:49
 THE
300-SPACE PARKING DURING THE
TERM OF THIS AGREEMENT.


[Captioner] 19:34:52
A LONGER TERM LEASE PROTECTS THE


[Captioner] 19:34:55
CITY FROM BUILDING THE PARKING
LOT, WHICH IS ALLOWED BY THE
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT

[Captioner] 19:34:59
 REPORT.
IN ADDITION, 25 YEARS IS
TYPICALLY A STANDARD

[Captioner] 19:35:02
 TIME FRAME
FOR THESE TYPES OF AGREEMENTS,


[Captioner] 19:35:06
AND OUR HISTORICAL PRACTICE,
GIVEN THE INVESTMENT

[Captioner] 19:35:08
 THAT EAST
BAY REGIONAL PARKS IS REQUIRED
TO COMMIT TO THIS SITE.


[Captioner] 19:35:14
WITH THIS REVISED PROPOSED LEASE


[Captioner] 19:35:17
AGREEMENT, STAFF RECOMMENDS THAT
YOU AUTHORIZE THE CITY MANAGER
TO EXECUTE THE LEASE

[Captioner] 19:35:20
 AGREEMENT
WITH STANFORD STAGING AREA AND
TO CONTINUE

[Captioner] 19:35:23
 THE 44-YEAR LEGACY
OF PROVIDING PUBLIC PARK


[Captioner] 19:35:27
RECREATION AND OPEN SPACE TO THE
RESIDENTS OF FREMONT, AND TO

[Captioner] 19:35:30
 THE
REGIONAL AREA.
STAFF ALSO

[Captioner] 19:35:33
 RECOMMENDS THAT YOU
FIND THE CONTINUATION OF THE
LEASE AGREEMENT TO

[Captioner] 19:35:36
 BE EXEMPT
FROM THE REQUIREMENTS OF CEQA AS
STATED IN

[Captioner] 19:35:39
 THE REPORT.
THE NEXT STEP, IF COUNCIL
APPROVES THIS EVENING,

[Captioner] 19:35:42
 IS TO
FORWARD THE LEASE AGREEMENT TO
THE DISTRICT BOARD FOR

[Captioner] 19:35:45
 THEIR
APPROVAL ON DECEMBER 6TH.
WITH THIS, WE'RE ALL AVAILABLE


[Captioner] 19:35:48
FOR ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY
HAVE.


[Captioner] 19:35:54
THAT CONCLUDES OUR REPORT.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK

[Captioner] 19:35:57
 YOU.
AT THIS TIME, I'D LIKE TO SEE IF
THERE'S ANY QUESTIONS FROM

[Captioner] 19:36:01
 THE
PUBLIC.
ARE THERE ANY SPEAKERS FROM

[Captioner] 19:36:04
 THE
PUBLIC?


[Captioner] 19:36:11
>> Ms. Gauthier: HANDS ARE
STARTING TO BE

[Captioner] 19:36:14
 RAISED.
>> Mayor Mei: SORRY, QUESTIONS
BY

[Captioner] 19:36:17
 COUNCILMEMBERS FIRST.
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN?


[Captioner] 19:36:20
>> Councilmember Kassan: THANK
YOU.
I HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS.


[Captioner] 19:36:27
ON PAGE 2, I THINK THIS IS

[Captioner] 19:36:30
 JUST
AN ERROR I WANTED TO POINT OUT,


[Captioner] 19:36:33
IN 2B, THERE'S A REFERENCE TO
PARAGRAPH 13.
I BELIEVE THAT SHOULD

[Captioner] 19:36:41
 BE 15.
ANOTHER QUESTION IS, YOU
MENTIONED THAT THERE WAS AN


[Captioner] 19:36:44
UPDATE TO THE GRAZING PERMIT

[Captioner] 19:36:46
 OR
LICENSE, BUT WE DON'T HAVE A
COPY OF THAT.


[Captioner] 19:36:50
 THAT I'VE BEEN ABLE
TO FIND.
SO IT

[Captioner] 19:36:53
 WOULD BE NICE TO SEE THAT.


[Captioner] 19:36:59
ANOTHER QUESTION IS,

[Captioner] 19:37:03
 ON PAGE 3,
THERE'S

[Captioner] 19:37:06
 A PROVISION THAT

[Captioner] 19:37:09
 SAYS --
RELATED TO CAPITAL

[Captioner] 19:37:12
 IMPROVEMENT
THAT APPROVAL WILL NOT BE


[Captioner] 19:37:15
UNREASONABLY WITHHELD.
I'M CONCERNED THAT ISN'T DEFINED
ANYWHERE, WHAT IS

[Captioner] 19:37:18
 CONSIDERED
REASONABLE.
I'M WONDERING IF THERE'S ANY


[Captioner] 19:37:21
STANDARD THAT YOU COULD POINT TO
OF WHAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED


[Captioner] 19:37:24
REASONABLE.
ALSO, IN TERMS OF APPROVAL OF


[Captioner] 19:37:28
CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS, I ASSUME
THAT'S JUST

[Captioner] 19:37:31
 MINISTERIAL AND THAT
WOULD NOT COME TO COUNCIL BUT I
WOULD LOVE AN ANSWER TO

[Captioner] 19:37:34
 THAT.


[Captioner] 19:37:41
I THINK THOSE WERE ALL MY
QUESTIONS.


[Captioner] 19:37:46
OH, I DID HAVE ANOTHER ONE

[Captioner] 19:37:49
 IN
SECTION 15,

[Captioner] 19:37:52
 TERMINATION.
I'M A LITTLE BIT CONCERNED

[Captioner] 19:37:55
 ABOUT
15B, IF THERE'S

[Captioner] 19:37:58
 A BREACH, THAT
THE LEASE CAN BE TERMINATED BUT
ONLY IF THE PARK HAS

[Captioner] 19:38:02
 NOT
UNDERTAKEN POSITIVE ACTION TO
CORRECT THE

[Captioner] 19:38:05
 BREACH.


[Captioner] 19:38:08
THAT SOUNDS A DIFFICULT THING TO
ENFORCE BECAUSE EVEN IF THEY


[Captioner] 19:38:12
UNDERTAKE A VERY MINUTE POSITIVE
ACTION, THAT WOULD BE

[Captioner] 19:38:18
 CONSIDERED
NO LONGER ELIGIBLE FOR
TERMINATION, SO I THINK WE

[Captioner] 19:38:21
 NEED
TO HAVE MORE DETAILS ABOUT

[Captioner] 19:38:25
 WHAT
ACTION NEEDS TO BE TAKEN IN THE
CASE OF A BREACH

[Captioner] 19:38:27
 TO PREVENT
TERMINATION.
I THINK THOSE ARE ALL MY


[Captioner] 19:38:30
QUESTIONS FOR NOW.


[Captioner] 19:38:39
>> Mayor Mei: NEXT IS
COUNCILMEMBER

[Captioner] 19:38:42
 JONES.
>> Councilmember Kassan: IS THAT
GOING TO GET ANSWERED

[Captioner] 19:38:46
 OR --
>> I WAS GOING TO ASK IF THE
CITY ATTORNEY WOULD LIKE TO


[Captioner] 19:38:49
RESPOND TO SOME OF THOSE


[Captioner] 19:38:54
QUESTIONS FIRST.

[Captioner] 19:38:59
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: SURE.
LET'S START REGARDING THE PHRASE
UNREASONABLY WITHHELD.


[Captioner] 19:39:02
THAT PHRASE IS ACTUALLY FAIRLY
COMMON IN AGREEMENTS AND IS


[Captioner] 19:39:06
GENERALLY NOT DEFINED FOR
PURPOSES OF

[Captioner] 19:39:09
 ALLOWING THE PARTIES
TO MAKE A CASE BY CASE


[Captioner] 19:39:12
DETERMINATION.
BUT IT ESSENTIALLY

[Captioner] 19:39:16
 CREATES A
BURDEN OF PROOF BASICALLY THE
CITY WOULD HAVE TO DEMONSTRATE


[Captioner] 19:39:20
THE REASON FOR WITHHOLDING THE
APPROVAL.


[Captioner] 19:39:23
THE DEFAULT POSITION IS THAT THE


[Captioner] 19:39:27
CITY WOULD ALLOW IT UNLESS THE
CITY CAN

[Captioner] 19:39:30
 DEMONSTRATE THE REASON
FOR THE WITHHOLDING.


[Captioner] 19:39:33
WITH RESPECT TO CURING OF


[Captioner] 19:39:38
DEFECTS, THAT'S ALSO TYPICALLY

[Captioner] 19:39:41
 A
CASE BY CASE DETERMINATION
THAT'S MADE IN

[Captioner] 19:39:43
 INTERPRETING THE
AGREEMENT.
IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT TO


[Captioner] 19:39:46
ANTICIPATE ALL OF THE
CIRCUMSTANCES AND ALL OF THE
REMEDIES THAT COULD

[Captioner] 19:39:49
 BE
ASCERTAINED FOR ANY PARTICULAR
BREACH, BUT THE

[Captioner] 19:39:53
 LANGUAGE HERE
DOES ALLOW THE CITY TO TAKE


[Captioner] 19:39:56
ACTION IF A BREACH WERE TO HAVE
OCCURRED, AND

[Captioner] 19:39:59
 POSITIVE ACTION
WERE NECESSARY.
SO AGAIN, THOSE ARE

[Captioner] 19:40:03
 REALLY --
BOTH OF THOSE ARE REALLY GREAT
QUESTIONS AND THEY BOTH

[Captioner] 19:40:05
 CONCERN
CASE BY CASE DETERMINATIONS THAT
REALLY DEPEND ON THE FACTS.


[Captioner] 19:40:11
>> Councilmember Kassan: OKAY.
THERE WAS ALSO A COUPLE OTHER
QUESTIONS ABOUT EXHIBIT B WHICH


[Captioner] 19:40:14
WE DON'T HAVE, AND THEN ALSO
WHETHER

[Captioner] 19:40:17
 APPROVALS OF CAPITAL
IMPROVEMENTS WOULD

[Captioner] 19:40:20
 REQUIRE
COUNCIL ACTION OR WOULD IT BE A
MINISTERIAL

[Captioner] 19:40:26
 DECISION?
>> Ms. Wolf: THE TYPE OF CAPITAL
PROJECTS WOULD DEPEND ON

[Captioner] 19:40:29
 THAT
ANSWER AS WELL, SO FOR EXAMPLE,
IF THEY

[Captioner] 19:40:32
 WERE REPAIRING A FENCE
WE WOULD NOT COME TO COUNCIL FOR
THAT TYPE OF CAPITAL PROJECT

[Captioner] 19:40:35
 IF
IT DOES NOT REQUIRE A PERMIT.
WE WOULD NOT BE COMING TO


[Captioner] 19:40:38
COUNCIL.
BUT IF IT DOES REQUIRE A PERMIT,
MOST LIKELY IT IS A

[Captioner] 19:40:42
 FUNDING
SOURCE THAT WE WOULD PROBABLY
NEED TO COME TO

[Captioner] 19:40:45
 COUNCIL FOR, FOR
ACTION, DEPENDING ON THE COST
AND

[Captioner] 19:40:49
 THE -- DEPENDING ON THE
ALLOCATION OF THE RESOURCES.


[Captioner] 19:40:53
>> Councilmember Kassan: SO IT'S
UNKNOWN WHETHER IT WOULD COME TO
COUNCIL

[Captioner] 19:40:56
 OR NOT?
>> Ms. Wolf: IT'S

[Captioner] 19:40:58
 A CASE-BY-CASE
BASIS DEPENDING ON THE TYPE OF
REQUEST.


[Captioner] 19:41:01
FOR EXAMPLE, IF THERE WAS A


[Captioner] 19:41:05
REQUEST FOR A RESTROOM, WHICH WE
CURRENTLY WOULD

[Captioner] 19:41:09
 DENY, BUT SAY IF
THE STAFF WERE TO RECOMMEND IT
IN THE

[Captioner] 19:41:12
 FUTURE, THAT WOULD BE ONE
THAT WOULD GO TO COUNCIL FOR
ACTION.


[Captioner] 19:41:18
>> Councilmember Kassan: OKAY.
AND ABOUT EXHIBIT B?


[Captioner] 19:41:25
>> Ms. Wolf: I DO NOT HAVE A
GOOD ANSWER FOR THAT RIGHT NOW.
I WOULD HAVE TO GO

[Captioner] 19:41:28
 BACK TO THE
ATTORNEY'S OFFICE ON THAT ONE.
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: 

[Captioner] 19:41:31
WE CAN
CERTAINLY PROVIDE THAT AND CAN
SHARE THAT VIA EMAIL.


[Captioner] 19:41:33
IT'S NOT IN THE PACKET, BUT WE
CAN CERTAINLY PROVIDE THAT
DOCUMENT.


[Captioner] 19:41:37
>> Councilmember Kassan: OKAY.
BECAUSE I WOULDN'T HAVE ASKED
ABOUT IT BUT IT WAS PART OF THE


[Captioner] 19:41:40
PRESENTATION THAT IT WAS
CHANGED, SO IT WOULD BE NICE TO
SEE IT.


[Captioner] 19:41:44
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:41:50
>> Mayor Mei: COUNCILMEMBER
JONES.
>> Councilmember Jones: THANK


[Captioner] 19:41:53
YOU, MADAME MAYOR.
SO I JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY,

[Captioner] 19:41:57
 MS. WOLF, THAT THE EAST BAY
REGIONAL PARKS DISTRICT

[Captioner] 19:42:00
 HAS
AGREED THAT THEY WILL NOT
CONSTRUCT A

[Captioner] 19:42:03
 PARKING LOT FOR THE
TERM OF THIS 20-YEAR LEASE.
IS THAT

[Captioner] 19:42:06
 CORRECT?
>> Ms. Wolf: THAT IS CORRECT.
AND SO IF IT WAS A

[Captioner] 19:42:09
 SHORTER-TERM
LEASE, THAT WOULD

[Captioner] 19:42:13
 PERHAPS CAUSE
REASON TO COME BACK SOONER FOR
THE

[Captioner] 19:42:16
 LOOKING AT THE 300 SPACES,
SO THAT'S

[Captioner] 19:42:19
 WHY WE DETERMINED A
20-YEAR LEASE WAS THE
APPROPRIATE TIME FRAME.


[Captioner] 19:42:23
>> Councilmember Jones: THANK
YOU.
I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT


[Captioner] 19:42:27
THE PUBLIC WAS AWARE OF THAT.


[Captioner] 19:42:32
>> Mayor Mei: COUNCILMEMBER COX.


[Captioner] 19:42:55
>> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.
THANK YOU.
THANK

[Captioner] 19:42:59
 YOU, SUZANNE WOLF, FOR
PUTTING THIS UPDATE

[Captioner] 19:43:03
 TOGETHER,
AND BEING ABLE TO

[Captioner] 19:43:06
 PRESENT IT.
I THINK IT'S BEEN ALMOST A YEAR
SINCE THE

[Captioner] 19:43:10
 LAST TIME WE'VE
REVIEWED

[Captioner] 19:43:14
 THIS.
ONE OF THE THINGS I WANTED TO
TALK ABOUT AND

[Captioner] 19:43:17
 BRING UP IS IN
THE ONE SECTION THAT TALKS ABOUT
EXCLUSIVE

[Captioner] 19:43:21
 CONTROL OVER

[Captioner] 19:43:24
 THE
PROPERTY, AND IT WAS MY
UNDERSTANDING THAT THE CITY OF


[Captioner] 19:43:27
FREMONT

[Captioner] 19:43:31
 OWNS LAND AND THE TITLE,
AND THAT

[Captioner] 19:43:34
 WORDING OF

[Captioner] 19:43:39
 EXCLUSIVE
CONTROL KIND OF TAKES US OUT OF
THE PICTURE TO BE ABLE TO MAKE


[Captioner] 19:43:42
ANY OTHER DECISIONS AND BEING
ABLE TO

[Captioner] 19:43:48
 STILL HAVE -- WE STILL
OWN IT

[Captioner] 19:43:52
 AND TRY TO UNDERSTAND
FROM THE COUNCIL, CITY ATTORNEY,
IF HE COULD

[Captioner] 19:43:55
 KIND OF ADD IN SOME
WORDING OF THINGS ABOUT
EXCLUSIVE CONTROL AND THE

[Captioner] 19:43:58
 WAY
THAT THIS IS WORDED.
I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM THE

[Captioner] 19:44:01
 WAY
THAT IT ALSO STATES THAT THE
PARK WOULD BE

[Captioner] 19:44:08
 MAINTAINED BY --
THE PARK DISTRICT WOULD BE ABLE
TO HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO

[Captioner] 19:44:11
 OPERATE
AND MANAGE THE PROPERTY, BUT
THAT

[Captioner] 19:44:14
 EXCLUSIVE CONTROL KIND OF
NEGATES US AS BEING

[Captioner] 19:44:17
 OWNERS OF
THE PROPERTY, AND MAYBE YOU
COULD HELP SHED

[Captioner] 19:44:21
 SOME LIGHT FROM
OUR CITY ATTORNEY'S PERSPECTIVE
ON THAT LEGAL

[Captioner] 19:44:24
 LANGUAGE THERE.
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: YES,
THANK

[Captioner] 19:44:27
 YOU, COUNCILMEMBER COX.
THE CITY RETAINS

[Captioner] 19:44:31
 OWNERSHIP
RIGHTS OVER THE PROPERTY.
WHAT WE ARE

[Captioner] 19:44:35
 AUTHORIZING PURSUANT
TO THE TERMS OF THE LEASE IS
ALLOWING THE

[Captioner] 19:44:38
 DISTRICT TO OPERATE
THE PARK AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE
REFERRING TO WHEN WE

[Captioner] 19:44:41
 TALK ABOUT
EXCLUSIVE CONTROL, THEY WOULD BE


[Captioner] 19:44:44
REQUIRED AS PROPERTY OWNER
GENERALLY, WE'D BE RESPONSIBLE


[Captioner] 19:44:48
FOR MAINTENANCE AND OTHER
RESPONSIBILITIES

[Captioner] 19:44:51
 REGARDING LAND
OWNERSHIP.
HERE WHAT WE'RE SAY SOMETHING


[Captioner] 19:44:54
WE'RE PARTNERING WITH THE
DISTRICT BY WAY OF THIS LEASE,


[Captioner] 19:44:57
AND THOUGH WE MAINTAIN OUR
OWNERSHIP RIGHTS, WE ARE


[Captioner] 19:45:01
ALLOWING THE DISTRICT TO OPERATE
THE PARK, AND THEY HAVE THE
EXCLUSIVE RIGHT TO

[Captioner] 19:45:04
 DO SO,
MEANING A THIRD PARTY, NOT THE


[Captioner] 19:45:07
DISTRICT, WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO
OPERATE THE PARK.
WE'RE RECOGNIZING THEM

[Captioner] 19:45:11
 AS THE
ENTITY THAT WILL ASSUME

[Captioner] 19:45:14
 THOSE
OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS.
THE

[Captioner] 19:45:17
 CITY'S RIGHTS ARE NOT IN ANY
WAY INJURED

[Captioner] 19:45:20
 BY WAY OF THIS
LEASE.
I MEAN, THE LEASE COVERS EXACTLY


[Captioner] 19:45:24
WHAT THE CITY IS ASKING THE
DISTRICT TO DO, AND THE

[Captioner] 19:45:27

DISTRICT, BY EXECUTING THE
LEASE, SHOULD THEY DO SO,

[Captioner] 19:45:30
 WOULD
BE AGREEING TO DO SO, INCLUDING
MAINTENANCE, INCLUDING

[Captioner] 19:45:33
 ALL THE
GRAZING TERMS, INCLUDING THE
FENCING, SO

[Captioner] 19:45:36
 ON AND SO FORTH.
SO THE LEASE ITSELF IS ACTUALLY


[Captioner] 19:45:39
THE DOCUMENT THAT PROVIDES

[Captioner] 19:45:43
 US
THE FULL CONTEXT OF WHAT THE
DISTRICT IS REQUIRED TO DO FOR


[Captioner] 19:45:46
US UNDER THE TERMS.
>> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.


[Captioner] 19:45:49
COULD YOU POINT IN THE LEASE
AGREEMENT WHERE IT

[Captioner] 19:45:54
 STATES
THAT -- EXCLUSIVELY SAYING THAT
IS UNDER THE PROPERTY OF

[Captioner] 19:45:56
 THE
CITY OF FREMONT?
BECAUSE I SEE A LOT OF TERMS


[Captioner] 19:45:59
WRITTEN THAT IT'S LEASE-OWNED
PROPERTY, YOU

[Captioner] 19:46:02
 KNOW, PER THE
GOVERNMENT CODE, BUT IT DOESN'T
REALLY

[Captioner] 19:46:05
 SAY LIKE THE CITY OF
FREMONT HAS THE OWNERSHIP
RIGHTS, AND

[Captioner] 19:46:09
 THAT'S WHAT I'M KIND
OF CONNECTING

[Captioner] 19:46:12
 THAT PART AND THEN
TURNING IT OVER TO HAVE THE

[Captioner] 19:46:15
 PARK
DISTRICT DO THEIR JOB AND
OPERATING AND MAINTAINING THE


[Captioner] 19:46:18
PARK.
AND THAT'S WHERE I'M KIND OF A
LITTLE LOST THERE

[Captioner] 19:46:21
 ON A LITTLE
BIT OF THE UP FRONT

[Captioner] 19:46:25
 AND THE
WITNESSETH

[Captioner] 19:46:28
 SECTION THAT TALKS
ABOUT THAT PART.
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: THE


[Captioner] 19:46:31
LEASE IS BOTH THE AUTHORITY AND
THE

[Captioner] 19:46:34
 LIMIT, THE LIMITATION
ITSELF, MEANING WE ARE

[Captioner] 19:46:37
 NOT
SAYING THAT WE ARE TRANSFERRING


[Captioner] 19:46:41
ANY PROPERTY, ANY PROPERTY
TITLES IN THE

[Captioner] 19:46:44
 PARK, MEANING
WE'RE NOT GIVING THEM A DEED FOR
THE

[Captioner] 19:46:46
 LAND AND TRANSFERRING
OWNERSHIP.


[Captioner] 19:46:50
WE MAINTAIN THE OWNERSHIP.
WHAT WE'RE SAYING

[Captioner] 19:46:53
 IS, WE'RE
ENTERING INTO A LEASE

[Captioner] 19:46:57
 WHEREBY
THEY WILL BE

[Captioner] 19:47:00
 PROVIDED CERTAIN
RESPONSIBILITIES, THEY AGREE TO
TAKE IT ON, AND

[Captioner] 19:47:03
 THOSE ARE WITHIN
THE DOCUMENT ITSELF.
NO MORE, NO LESS THAN WHAT

[Captioner] 19:47:06
 YOU
SEE IN THIS LEASE.
SO THERE'S NOTHING IN THIS


[Captioner] 19:47:09
DOCUMENT THAT RELINQUISHES OUR
OWNERSHIP RIGHTS.


[Captioner] 19:47:12
WHAT WE DO, THOUGH, IS WE


[Captioner] 19:47:15
TRANSFER OUR RESPONSIBILITIES
REGARDING HOW TO

[Captioner] 19:47:19
 MAINTAIN THAT
LAND.
ALL THE

[Captioner] 19:47:22
 TERMS THAT YOU SEE HERE
WOULD GOVERN, IF THE PARTIES


[Captioner] 19:47:25
AGREE, AND THEY WOULD TAKE OVER
THOSE RESPONSIBILITIES, OR THEY
WOULD CONTINUE

[Captioner] 19:47:28
 TO ASSUME THOSE
RESPONSIBILITIES GOING FORWARD,
BECAUSE WE'RE CURRENTLY

[Captioner] 19:47:30
 UNDER A
LEASE, THOUGH IT'S MONTH TO
MONTH.


[Captioner] 19:47:33
SO THERE'S REALLY NO ADDITIONAL
LANGUAGE THAT WE NEED HERE TO


[Captioner] 19:47:36
PROTECT THE CITY'S OWNERSHIP
INTEREST.
>> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.


[Captioner] 19:47:40
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: REALLY,
THIS ONLY GOVERNS THE CITY'S
LEASE

[Captioner] 19:47:43
 REGARDING THE PROPERTY.
IT DOESN'T DO ANYTHING REGARDING
THE TRANSFER

[Captioner] 19:47:47
 OF PROPERTY.
>> City Mgr. Shackelford: IF

[Captioner] 19:47:50
 I
MAY ADD, COUNCILMEMBER COX, IF I
UNDERSTAND YOUR QUESTION, IF


[Captioner] 19:47:53
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING IN
THE LEASE A

[Captioner] 19:47:57
 AGREEMENT THAT
EXPRESSLY STATES THE CITY OWNS
THE

[Captioner] 19:48:00
 LAND, IS THAT CORRECT?
>> Councilmember Cox: YES, I
WOULD LIKE TO SEE SOMETHING TO


[Captioner] 19:48:03
THAT EFFECT, THAT WE MAINTAIN,
AS THIS IS A LEASE AGREEMENT.


[Captioner] 19:48:06
I KNOW THERE IS A LOT OF
GOVERNMENT CODES CALLED OUT
HERE.


[Captioner] 19:48:09
I'M NOT AN ATTORNEY, AND --
>> City Mgr. Shackelford: SO


[Captioner] 19:48:13
EVERYTHING --
>> Councilmember Cox: AND I JUST
WANT TO MAKE SURE FROM

[Captioner] 19:48:16
 A
TAXPAYER STANDPOINT, FROM THE
FREMONT TAXPAYERS, THAT

[Captioner] 19:48:19
 THEY
WANT TO KNOW THAT THIS IS NOT
SOMETHING THAT WE

[Captioner] 19:48:23
 ARE TURNING
OVER ANY LAND OR ANY PROPERTY AT
THIS POINT, BUT IT'S

[Captioner] 19:48:26
 PURELY A
LEASE AGREEMENT.
I KNOW IT SAYS IT THERE,

[Captioner] 19:48:29
 BUT I
NEED SOMETHING THAT SAYS THAT WE
WILL ALWAYS MAINTAIN THROUGHOUT


[Captioner] 19:48:32
THE TERM OF THE LEASE THE


[Captioner] 19:48:34
OWNERSHIP.
>> City Mgr. Shackelford: RIGHT.
SO EVERYTHING RAFAEL SAID IS UP


[Captioner] 19:48:38



[Captioner] 19:48:41
100% ACCURATE.
I'M NOT AN ATTORNEY SO I'M NOT
GOING TO

[Captioner] 19:48:44
 TRY AND CHALLENGE IT
ANYWAY.
BUT ONE OF THE FIRST -- I THINK


[Captioner] 19:48:47
IT'S THE THIRD WHEREAS, I THINK
THAT PROVIDES YOU WITH THE


[Captioner] 19:48:50
LANGUAGE THAT YOU'RE --
>> Councilmember Kassan: I'M SO
SORRY

[Captioner] 19:48:54
 TO INTERRUPT BUT IF

[Captioner] 19:48:59
 YOU
LOOK AT THE LAST PART OF SECTION


[Captioner] 19:49:02
ONE, IT'S IN THERE.
>> City Mgr. Shackelford: IN THE
VERY BEGINNING IT DOES

[Captioner] 19:49:05
 STATE
THAT.


[Captioner] 19:49:12
>> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.
>> City Mgr. Shackelford: 

[Captioner] 19:49:14
AND
THEN ALSO IN THE AREA THAT
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN JUST


[Captioner] 19:49:17
REFERENCED.


[Captioner] 19:49:24
>> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.
THAT TAKES CARE

[Captioner] 19:49:27
 OF ONE OF MY
QUESTIONS.


[Captioner] 19:49:30
I WANTED TO ALSO ASK, SINCE WE


[Captioner] 19:49:34
DO HAVE SOMEONE -- SINCE PART OF
THE RESPONSIBILITY OF

[Captioner] 19:49:37
 MANAGING
THE PARK IS THE CURFEW
MANAGEMENT PART OF

[Captioner] 19:49:41
 IT, AS WELL
AS THE MAINTENANCE, AND TRYING


[Captioner] 19:49:44
TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS THE
RESOURCES LOOK LIKE FROM

[Captioner] 19:49:48
 THE
PARK STANDPOINT AS THEY'RE BEING
ABLE

[Captioner] 19:49:51
 TO MANAGE AND CARRY OUT THE


[Captioner] 19:49:56
CURFEW AND MAKING SURE FROM WHAT
I'VE HEARD FROM QUITE A FEW


[Captioner] 19:50:00
CONSTITUENTS THAT, YOU

[Captioner] 19:50:04
 KNOW, HAD
EXPERIENCES OF THOSE COMING
EARLIER, BEFORE

[Captioner] 19:50:07
 THE ACTUAL HOURS
OF THE PARK HAVE STARTED OR
STARTED

[Captioner] 19:50:10
 LATER SO KIND OF HELP IN
EXPLAINING A

[Captioner] 19:50:13
 LITTLE BIT MORE

[Captioner] 19:50:17
 OF
HOW WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE

[Captioner] 19:50:20
 TO
MANAGE THIS PART OF THE CURFEW
BY THE PARKSIDE.


[Captioner] 19:50:24
>> City Mgr. Shackelford:PERHAP
S MR. O'CONNOR CAN CAULK TO US
ABOUT

[Captioner] 19:50:26
 HOW THEY MANAGE THE
CURFEWS?
>> ABSOLUTELY.


[Captioner] 19:50:30
COUNCILMEMBER

[Captioner] 19:50:33
 COX, SO WE MANAGE
THE CURFEW IN SEVERAL WAYS.
ONE IS

[Captioner] 19:50:37
 WE HAVE

[Captioner] 19:50:41
 APPROXIMATELY 66
OFFICERS IN

[Captioner] 19:50:43
 OUR POLICE
DEPARTMENT.
MISSION PEAK IS INCLUDED IN ONE


[Captioner] 19:50:47
OF THEIR BEAT -- PATROL BEATS,


[Captioner] 19:50:50
AND WE DO KEEP TRACK

[Captioner] 19:50:53
 OF
STATISTICS, FOR INSTANCE,

[Captioner] 19:50:57
 IN
2021, OUR POLICE OFFICERS ISSUED
35 CITATIONS

[Captioner] 19:51:00
 FOR AFTER HOURS,
PEOPLE BEING AFTER HOURS IN

[Captioner] 19:51:04
 THE
PARK.
EITHER THEIR

[Captioner] 19:51:06
 VEHICLES PARKED IN
THE PARKING LOT OR IN THE PARK
ITSELF.


[Captioner] 19:51:10
AND IN 2022 TO DATE, WE'VE


[Captioner] 19:51:14
ISSUED 34 CITATIONS FOR AFTER
HOURS CURFEW.


[Captioner] 19:51:19
ALSO, YOU MIGHT BE AWARE THAT IN
2014, WE DID, IN AN

[Captioner] 19:51:22
 EFFORT TO
ADDRESS THIS

[Captioner] 19:51:25
 ISSUE WITH THE
NEIGHBORS, WE DID REDUCE

[Captioner] 19:51:27
 THE
HOURS OF THIS ENTRANCE INTO THE
PARK.


[Captioner] 19:51:31
THE HOURS YOU SEE TODAY THAT ARE
ACTUALLY LISTED IN THE LEASE


[Captioner] 19:51:34
AGREEMENT, THOSE WERE REDUCED
FROM OUR NORMAL HOURS,

[Captioner] 19:51:38
 CURFEW
HOURS OF 10:00 P.M. TO 5:00 A.M.


[Captioner] 19:51:41
SO WE CHANGED THE HOURS TO TRY
AND REDUCE THE AFTER-HOURS USE
OF

[Captioner] 19:51:44
 THE PARK.
ADDITIONALLY, THINGS THAT WE
HAVE

[Captioner] 19:51:48
 DONE IN THE PARK DISTRICT,
WE HAVE ACTUALLY DONE WHAT WE
CALL TARGETED ENFORCE M

[Captioner] 19:51:52
 THE,
WHERE OUR SPECIAL ENFORCEMENT
UNIT WILL

[Captioner] 19:51:55
 GO OUT THERE

[Captioner] 19:51:58
 AFTER
HOURS AND SPECIFICALLY LOOK FOR
VIOLATIONS OF THE

[Captioner] 19:52:03
 AFTER-HOURS --
FOR AFTER HOURS USE THERE IN THE
PARK.


[Captioner] 19:52:07
SO THOSE ARE WAYS WE'VE
ATTEMPTED TO MANAGE THIS AFTER
HOURS USE OF

[Captioner] 19:52:10
 THE PARK.
>> Councilmember Cox: 

[Captioner] 19:52:14
OKAY.
DOES ALL OF OUR HOURS FOR

[Captioner] 19:52:17
 OUR
PARKS THAT ARE BEING MANAGED BY
EAST BAY REGIONAL

[Captioner] 19:52:20
 PARK, ARE THEY
ALL THE SAME HOURS?
>>

[Captioner] 19:52:25
 THEY ARE NOT.
MOST OF THE PARKS WE MANAGE, AND
I'M

[Captioner] 19:52:28
 SORRY I DON'T HAVE THE
SPECIFICS IN FRONT OF ME, BUT
MOST OF THE PARKS

[Captioner] 19:52:31
 WE MANAGE HAVE
THAT 10:00 P.M. TO 5:00 A.M.
CURFEW.


[Captioner] 19:52:34
NOW, KEEP IN MIND

[Captioner] 19:52:37
 THAT WE  DO
HAVE

[Captioner] 19:52:41
 DIFFERENT HOURS FOR THE
ENTRANCE GATES, OFTENTIMES THOSE


[Captioner] 19:52:44
ARE 8:00 A.M. TO USUALLY AROUND
SUNSET, BUT OUR CURFEW

[Captioner] 19:52:48
 HOURS ARE
SPECIFICALLY 10:00 P.M. TO
5:00 A.M.

[Captioner] 19:52:51
 SO PEOPLE CAN'T ENTER
SOME OF THOSE PARKS OUTSIDE OF


[Captioner] 19:52:54
THE GATE HOURS.
>> Councilmember Cox: THANK YOU
FOR PROVIDING THAT ADDITIONAL


[Captioner] 19:52:56
INFORMATION.
THAT DOES HELP.
I HAD A QUESTION ABOUT PARKING


[Captioner] 19:53:02
PERMITS.
AND I SAW THAT THE CURRENT
PARKING PERMITS

[Captioner] 19:53:06
 WILL END IN JULY 20

[Captioner] 19:53:09
 2023, AND HOW WILL IT WORK
IN

[Captioner] 19:53:12
 TERMS OF THOSE THAT ARE
PERMIT HOLDERS, HOW

[Captioner] 19:53:15
 ARE THEY
GOING TO BE ABLE TO -- WILL THEY


[Captioner] 19:53:19
JUST HAD IT RENEWED EVERY COUPLE
YEARS IN THE EVENT THAT THIS


[Captioner] 19:53:22
LEASE IS GOING TO GO ON FOR 20
YEARS?


[Captioner] 19:53:25
>> City Mgr. Shackelford: THE
PARKING PERMIT PROGRAM -- OH,
SORRY.


[Captioner] 19:53:29
THE PARKING PERMIT PROGRAM WILL
BE

[Captioner] 19:53:33
 EXTENDED, SO STAFF IS WORKING
ON THAT, YOU KNOW, RIGHT

[Captioner] 19:53:36
 NOW.
SO LANCE MAY HAVE SOMETHING MORE
TO ADD TO WHERE WE

[Captioner] 19:53:39
 ARE ON THAT
OR WHAT THAT'S GOING TO LOOK


[Captioner] 19:53:43
LIKE.
>> THANK YOU, CITY MANAGER
SHACKELFORD.


[Captioner] 19:53:47
YES, WE ARE GOING TO BE WORKING
TOWARDS BRINGING THIS BACK TO
COUNCIL

[Captioner] 19:53:50
 EARLY NEXT YEAR WITH A
RECOMMENDATION TO CONTINUE THE
PERMIT PARKING PROGRAM.


[Captioner] 19:54:00
>> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.
IS THAT THE EARLY PART OF 2023
OR IS THERE A TARGET

[Captioner] 19:54:03
 DATE AT
THIS POINT?


[Captioner] 19:54:06
>> WE ARE TARGETING THE FIRST
QUARTER OF THE YEAR.
OBVIOUSLY

[Captioner] 19:54:09
 THE LEASE AGREEMENT OR
THE PERMIT

[Captioner] 19:54:14
 PARKING PROGRAM
EXPIRES IN JULY, SO WE HOPE TO
BRING THAT

[Captioner] 19:54:17
 TO COUNCIL LONG
BEFORE THE EXPIRATION TO GET
RECOMMENDATION AND

[Captioner] 19:54:19
 APPROVAL.
>> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:54:25
ONE OTHER COMMENT, IT ON THE
LINES OF

[Captioner] 19:54:29
 COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN AS
WE HAD LIKE EXHIBIT B, IT WOULD


[Captioner] 19:54:32
BE NICE TO HAVE THE SIDE LETTER
ATTACHED AS

[Captioner] 19:54:36
 EXHIBIT C ON TO THE
LEASE AGREEMENT SO

[Captioner] 19:54:39
 WHEN WE HAVE
THE WHOLE LEASE, THAT WE HAVE
ALL THE EXHIBITS AND ALL THE


[Captioner] 19:54:45
CONTENTS AND CLOSED INITY
ENTIRETY SO IT'S A

[Captioner] 19:54:48
 STANDALONE
DOCUMENT WITH ALL THE PAPERWORK.
SO THAT SIDE LETTER ABOUT NOT


[Captioner] 19:54:52
BUILDING THE -- NO LARGER THAN A
300 PARKING LOT, I

[Captioner] 19:54:56
 WOULD LIKE TO
HAVE THAT ADDED AS ANOTHER
EXHIBIT TO

[Captioner] 19:54:59
 THE LEASE AGREEMENT.


[Captioner] 19:55:03
AND I ALSO -- I'M GOING TO GO
BACK TO

[Captioner] 19:55:06
 OUR CITY

[Captioner] 19:55:10
 ATTORNEY.
ON THE

[Captioner] 19:55:13
 COOPERATION CLAUSE THAT'S
CALLED

[Captioner] 19:55:17
 OUT, WHAT HAPPENS IF
EITHER ONE OF US DO NOT


[Captioner] 19:55:20
COOPERATE AND WORK SOMETHING
OUT, WHAT'S THE

[Captioner] 19:55:24
 NEXT STEP IN
ESCALATION TO RESOLVE A

[Captioner] 19:55:28
 MATTER
IF THE COOPERATIVE

[Captioner] 19:55:32
 AGREEMENT
IS -- THE COOPERATION CLAUSE IS
NOT

[Captioner] 19:55:36
 RESOLVING CURRENT ISSUES?
AND I WAS JUST TRYING TO FIND
OUT WHAT'S

[Captioner] 19:55:39
 THE PATHWAY TO GET
THAT RESOLVED?
BECAUSE I DIDN'T

[Captioner] 19:55:42
 SEE ANY
ARBITRATION OR I DIDN'T

[Captioner] 19:55:45
 SEE ANY
OTHER TYPE OF LEGAL ACTION

[Captioner] 19:55:47

THERE.
>> City Mgr. Shackelford:COUNCI


[Captioner] 19:55:51
LMEMBER COX, CAN YOU TELL US
WHERE IN

[Captioner] 19:55:54
 THE AGREEMENT --
>> Councilmember Cox: SECTION
14.


[Captioner] 19:55:55
>> City Mgr. Shackelford:SECTIO
N 14?
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:56:05
>> Ms. Wolf: I MIGHT ADD,
COUNCILMEMBER COX, THAT IN YOUR
PACKET

[Captioner] 19:56:08
 THIS EVENING, YOU
RECEIVED A COPY OF

[Captioner] 19:56:10
 THE SIDE
LETTER ALONG WITH THE COMMUNITY
COMMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN RECEIVED


[Captioner] 19:56:13
BY THE CITY.
>> Councilmember Cox: YES.


[Captioner] 19:56:16
BUT I WAS JUST MAKING A NOTE
THAT EVEN THOUGH YOU

[Captioner] 19:56:20
 RECEIVED
IT, I'D LIKE TO JUST HAVE IT
ATTACHED AS AN

[Captioner] 19:56:23
 ATTACHMENT, AS
PART OF THE AGREEMENT.


[Captioner] 19:56:27
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: THE
SIDE LETTER WOULD BE
SUPPLEMENTAL

[Captioner] 19:56:30
 TO THE EXISTING
AGREEMENT.
IT WOULDN'T SERVE AS

[Captioner] 19:56:33
 AN
ATTACHMENT.
IT WOULD

[Captioner] 19:56:36
 HAVE THE SAME LEGAL
EFFECT, I MEAN, IT'S AN


[Captioner] 19:56:39
AGREEMENT BUT IT WOULDN'T BE AN
ATTACHMENT TO THE MASTER LEASE,
IS MY

[Captioner] 19:56:42
 UNDERSTANDING.
>> Councilmember Cox: YOU'RE
SAYING IT WOULD BE LIKE A


[Captioner] 19:56:46
STANDALONE BY ITSELF, THAT SIDE
LETTER?


[Captioner] 19:56:49
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: YEAH.
>> Councilmember Cox: BUT
REFERENCING BACK TO THE LEASE?


[Captioner] 19:56:52
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: IT


[Captioner] 19:56:56
ARISES OUT OF THAT LEASE.
IN TERMS OF QUESTION 14, I

[Captioner] 19:56:58
 THINK
I MISSED YOUR QUESTION,
COUNCILMEMBER COX.


[Captioner] 19:57:02
>> Councilmember Cox: I WAS
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT, IT'S GOOD
TO

[Captioner] 19:57:04
 HAVE COOPERATION.
EVERYBODY IS WORKING IN GOOD
FAITH.


[Captioner] 19:57:08
BUT WHAT HAPPENS IF WE ARE NOT
ABLE TO

[Captioner] 19:57:12
 REACH -- SOMETHING
HAPPENS AND WE'RE NOT ABLE TO
REACH A MATTER TO SOLVE

[Captioner] 19:57:15
 IT UNDER
THE TERMS OF THE COOPERATION


[Captioner] 19:57:18
BESIDE TERMINATING AN AGREEMENT,
IS THERE ANY OTHER PATHWAY TO


[Captioner] 19:57:22
RESOLVE ISSUES THAT COME

[Captioner] 19:57:29
 UP

[Captioner] 19:57:32
?
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: 

[Captioner] 19:57:34
FRANKLY
IT WOULD REALLY DEPEND ON THE
ISSUE.


[Captioner] 19:57:37
THAT'S A BROAD QUESTION.
THE COOPERATION SECTION REALLY
JUST

[Captioner] 19:57:40
 DISCUSSES GENERALLY THAT
THE PARTIES DESIRE TO COOPERATE
WHEN

[Captioner] 19:57:44
 THERE'S AN ISSUE THAT
ARISES.
THERE MIGHT

[Captioner] 19:57:47
 BE CIRCUMSTANCES
THAT THE PARTIES

[Captioner] 19:57:50
 CANNOT AGREE
TO, AND THAT'S WHERE THE CURE


[Captioner] 19:57:54
SECTION -- THE CURE LANGUAGE IN
THE

[Captioner] 19:57:56
 TERMINATION SECTION MIGHT
TRIGGER.
>> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.


[Captioner] 19:58:01
>> Ms. Wolf: I MIGHT ALSO ADD,
WE HAVE A LIAISON COMMITTEE

[Captioner] 19:58:04
 THAT


[Captioner] 19:58:07
COUNCILMEMBER CURRENTLY
COUNCILMEMBER JONES SITS ON, AND


[Captioner] 19:58:13
WE MEET ON A SEMI REGULAR BASIS,
WHEN ISSUES

[Captioner] 19:58:16
 ARISE, THEN WE CAN
BRING THAT FORWARD TO THE
LIAISON COMMITTEE.


[Captioner] 19:58:20
>> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.


[Captioner] 19:58:23
NOT ENTIRELY WHAT I'M LOOKING
FOR, BUT I WAS

[Captioner] 19:58:27
 JUST LOOKING AT
SOMETHING ELSE THAT WAS A LITTLE
MORE FORMAL, SO YOU WOULD

[Captioner] 19:58:31
 GO
INTO IF THINGS DID NOT WORK OUT
THROUGH ALL

[Captioner] 19:58:36
 MATTERS, LIAISON
COMMITTEE, WORKING WITH

[Captioner] 19:58:39
 BOTH
SIDES, THEN

[Captioner] 19:58:42
 YOUR LAST STANCE OF
RESOLVING AN ISSUE WOULD

[Captioner] 19:58:45
 BE
UNDER SOME SORT OF CURING TIME
TO RESOLVE IT, IS

[Captioner] 19:58:47
 WHAT YOU'RE
SAYING?
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado:BASICAL


[Captioner] 19:58:51
LY TO ISSUE A WRITTEN
NOTIFICATION TO THE OTHER PARTY
THAT THEY MAY

[Captioner] 19:58:54
 BE UNDER A
MATERIAL BREACH UNDER THE LEASE
AGREEMENT, AND

[Captioner] 19:58:57
 THEN THAT
PRESUMABLY WOULD TRIGGER
ADDITIONAL DISCUSSIONS

[Captioner] 19:58:59
 AND
HOPEFULLY A RESOLUTION.
>> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.


[Captioner] 19:59:04
I'M JUST ASKING TO UNDERSTAND
OUR PATHWAY HERE.


[Captioner] 19:59:08
AND MY LAST QUESTION IS, AS FAR


[Captioner] 19:59:11
AS -- I DIDN'T SEE -- OR

[Captioner] 19:59:14
 MAYBE
IT COVERED UNDER ANOTHER AREA
HERE, BUT IN THE BIG PICTURE,


[Captioner] 19:59:17
I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND AS

[Captioner] 19:59:21
 WE
HAVE THIS AGREEMENT,

[Captioner] 19:59:24
 HOW IS THE
REVIEW OF

[Captioner] 19:59:27
 THE PERFORMANCE OF THE
PARK DISTRICT AND MAINTAINING


[Captioner] 19:59:31
AND CARRYING OUT RESPONSIBILITY,
HOW IS

[Captioner] 19:59:34
 THAT -- WHAT'S THE
FEEDBACK KIND OF ON

[Captioner] 19:59:39
 THE
PERFORMANCE, HOW IS THAT BEING
CARRIED OUT AND

[Captioner] 19:59:42
 IS THE COMMUNITY


[Captioner] 19:59:45
ABLE TO VOICE THEIR CONCERNS
WORKING

[Captioner] 19:59:48
 WITH CITY STAFF?
IS THERE A PLACE

[Captioner] 19:59:50
 FOR THAT IN
HERE?
BECAUSE I KNOW THAT WAS ONE OF


[Captioner] 19:59:53
THE THINGS I BROUGHT UP LAST
TIME, WAS TO HAVE

[Captioner] 19:59:57
 SOME SORT OF


[Captioner] 20:00:00
PERFORMANCE REVIEW IN TERMS OF
FEEDBACK AND HOW WE COULD WORK
ON AREAS

[Captioner] 20:00:03
 THAT MAY COME UP OR IS
THIS JUST PART OF

[Captioner] 20:00:06
 THE LIAISON
COMMITTEE THAT WOULD DO THAT,
BUT HOW IS THAT

[Captioner] 20:00:09
 ALSO ALLOWING
OUR RESIDENT TO BE ABLE TO SPEAK
OUT?


[Captioner] 20:00:17
>> Ms. Wolf: I CAN ASK JIM TO
SPEAK TO

[Captioner] 20:00:21
 HOWL COMMUNITY MEMBERS
CAN REACH OUT TO THE EAST BAY


[Captioner] 20:00:24
REGIONAL PARKS FOR THEIR
OPERATIONAL ISSUES THERE, AND
CERTAINLY

[Captioner] 20:00:27
 THEY CAN CALL THE CITY
ON ANYTHING RELATED TO PERMIT
PARKING OR

[Captioner] 20:00:30
 ANYTHING OUTSIDE OF
THE LEASED AREA AS WELL.


[Captioner] 20:00:35
>> I WOULD LOVE TO ANSWER THAT
QUESTION.
SO

[Captioner] 20:00:39
 MUCH LIKE THE CITY, WE HAVE
REGULAR PUBLIC

[Captioner] 20:00:42
 MEETINGS OF OUR
BOARD.
WE ALSO HAVE

[Captioner] 20:00:45
 A SUBCOMMITTEE OF
THE BOARD CALLED PARK OPERATIONS


[Captioner] 20:00:49
COMMITTEE.
AND WE'VE OFTEN HEARD

[Captioner] 20:00:52
 ISSUES
RELATED TO PARK

[Captioner] 20:00:55
 OPERATIONS AT
DIFFERENT PARKS INCLUDING
MISSION PEAK AT THE PARK


[Captioner] 20:00:59
OPERATIONS COMMITTEE, SO

[Captioner] 20:01:02
 THAT IS
AN AVENUE FOR MEMBERS OF THE
COMMUNITY TO SPEAK OUT

[Captioner] 20:01:07
 AND AS
SUZANNE HAD SPOKEN PREVIOUSLY,
WE DO

[Captioner] 20:01:10
 HAVE LIAISON COMMITTEE
MEETINGS AND THOSE ARE

[Captioner] 20:01:14
 OFTEN
FORUMS FOR COMMUNITY MEMBERS TO
SPEAK OUT, SO I THINK THOSE

[Captioner] 20:01:17
 ARE
OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE COMMUNITY
TO ADDRESS

[Captioner] 20:01:21
 ISSUES LED 

[Captioner] 20:01:24
 RELATED TO THE
PARK.
>> Councilmember Cox: IS THERE A


[Captioner] 20:01:27
REASON WHY IT WOULD NOT BE IN
THIS PART OF THE AGREEMENT

[Captioner] 20:01:30
 OR
ANYWHERE THAT IT WOULD BE HAVING
SOME SORT

[Captioner] 20:01:33
 OF PERFORMANCE REVIEW?


[Captioner] 20:01:38
>> COUNCILMEMBER COX, I CAN TELL
YOU THAT'S NOT A COMMON PRACTICE
FOR

[Captioner] 20:01:41
 ANY OF OUR OPERATIONS
AGREEMENTS THAT WE HAVE
THROUGHOUT

[Captioner] 20:01:45
 THE PARK DISTRICT.
INCLUDING OUR AGREEMENTS WITH


[Captioner] 20:01:48
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR
OPERATING THREE STATE

[Captioner] 20:01:51
 PARKS.
THAT'S NOT COMMON PRACTICE.


[Captioner] 20:01:54
>> Councilmember Cox: I SEE.
OKAY.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:02:02
>> Councilmember Kassan: I'M SO
SORRY, BUT I HEARD

[Captioner] 20:02:06
 MENTIONED
THAT WE RECEIVED A COPY OF THE
SIDE LETTER.


[Captioner] 20:02:09
I DON'T KNOW WHERE THAT WAS.
CAN YOU CLARIFY WHERE THAT WAS
SENT?


[Captioner] 20:02:13
>> Ms. Wolf: IT WAS ATTACHED
INTO THE PACKET THAT WAS SENT
OUT THIS

[Captioner] 20:02:16
 EVENING AROUND 4:00 BY
OUR CITY CLERK'S OFFICE WITH

[Captioner] 20:02:20
 THE
CONSTITUENT --
>> Councilmember Kassan: ARE YOU


[Captioner] 20:02:22
SURE?
>> Ms. Wolf: IT'S THE FIRST
LETTER THAT WAS ATTACHED.


[Captioner] 20:02:29
>> Councilmember Kassan: AM I
THE ONLY ONE WHO DIDN'T SEE THAT
THERE?


[Captioner] 20:02:33
I RECEIVED SOMETHING AT 3:53 BUT
I

[Captioner] 20:02:36
 DON'T SEE

[Captioner] 20:02:39
 THE SIDE LETTER
ATTACHED.


[Captioner] 20:02:46
>> Vice Mayor Keng: ALSO, IS
THAT AVAILABLE TO BE SEEN ON THE


[Captioner] 20:02:49
AGENDA?
>> Ms. Gauthier: IT PART OF THE
PUBLIC COMMUNICATIONS


[Captioner] 20:02:52
ATTACHMENT.
>> Ms. Wolf: CORRECT.
>> Vice Mayor Keng: ARE THOSE


[Captioner] 20:02:56
AVAILABLE TO BE SEEN ON THE CITY
WEBSITE OF

[Captioner] 20:02:59
 TONIGHT'S AGENDA?
>> Ms. Gauthier: YES.
>> Vice Mayor Keng: OKAY.


[Captioner] 20:03:04
>> Ms. Wolf: CAN THE CLERK
CLARIFY THAT FOR THE COUNCIL?


[Captioner] 20:03:08
>> Ms. Gauthier: YES, I'M LOOK
BEING AT IT RIGHT NOW FROM THE


[Captioner] 20:03:11
WEBSITE, IT'S AGENDA ITEM 6A,


[Captioner] 20:03:14
MISSION PEAK LEASE AGREEMENT,
PUBLIC COMMUNICATIONS.
IT'S

[Captioner] 20:03:18
 THE LAST LINK ON THE AGENDA
CENTER WEBSITE.


[Captioner] 20:03:35
>> Councilmember Kassan: BUT IT
DIDN'T GO OUT IN THAT EMAIL, DID


[Captioner] 20:03:37
IT?
>> City Mgr. Shackelford: I
THINK THERE WERE THREE


[Captioner] 20:03:40
ATTACHMENTS TO THE EMAIL, AND IN
LOOKING AT MY EMAIL, IT'S

[Captioner] 20:03:43
 THE
FIRST PIECE OF CORRESPONDENCE
AND THE THIRD ATTACHMENT.


[Captioner] 20:03:54
>> Councilmember Cox: THE LETTER
FROM SABRINA.


[Captioner] 20:03:56
>> Councilmember Kassan: OH.
THAT'S WHAT YOU CALL A SIDE
AGREEMENT?


[Captioner] 20:03:59
THIS DOES NOT LOOK LIKE A
SIDE -- I THOUGHT THAT WAS JUST
A LETTER.


[Captioner] 20:04:03
THAT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE A SIDE
AGREEMENT TO ME, BUT OKAY, IF
THAT'S WHAT YOU

[Captioner] 20:04:06
 WERE REFERRING
TO.


[Captioner] 20:04:10
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

[Captioner] 20:04:12
 THE
LETTER -- OH, THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE
CALLING THE SIDE AGREEMENT.


[Captioner] 20:04:14
OKAY.
I UNDERSTAND.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:04:26
>> Mayor Mei: CLARIFYING
QUESTIONS, COUNCILMEMBER

[Captioner] 20:04:32
 SALWAN.
>> Councilmember Salwan: THANK
YOU, MADAME MAYOR.


[Captioner] 20:04:36
APPRECIATE EVERYBODY'S WORK AND
ALL THE GOOD QUESTIONS THAT HAVE
BEEN ASKED

[Captioner] 20:04:38
 SO I'LL TRY AND STAY
ON POINT WITH THE ONES THAT HAVE
NOT BEEN ASKED.


[Captioner] 20:04:44
ONE WAS MR. O'CONNOR KIND OF
INTRIGUED MY IMAGINATION, HE


[Captioner] 20:04:47
SAID THAT THERE

[Captioner] 20:04:50
 WAS A POLICE
FORCE THAT

[Captioner] 20:04:53
 ENFORCES OVERNIGHT
CURFEW VIOLATIONS.
I WAS WONDERING HOW THAT

[Captioner] 20:04:56
 WORKS.
IS THAT COMPLAINT-DRIVEN

[Captioner] 20:04:59
 OR IS
THAT ON ROUTINE PATROL OR HOW
DOES

[Captioner] 20:05:03
 THAT WORK?


[Captioner] 20:05:10
>> COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN, SO IT
CAN EITHER BE

[Captioner] 20:05:13
 A CALL FOR SERVICE
OR PART OF

[Captioner] 20:05:17
 ROUTINE PATROL OR IT
CAN BE PART OF THE TARGETED
ENFORCEMENT

[Captioner] 20:05:20
 EFFORT.
IF WE'RE SEEING AN UPTICK IN
AFTER

[Captioner] 20:05:23
 HOURS VIOLATIONS, OUR
POLICE DEPARTMENT CAN HAVE OUR


[Captioner] 20:05:26
SPECIAL ENFORCEMENT UNIT DO A
SERIES

[Captioner] 20:05:29
 OF TARGETED ENFORCEMENT
ON CERTAIN NIGHTS, ON RANDOM


[Captioner] 20:05:33
NIGHTS, AND TRY TO CURTAIL THAT
IF

[Captioner] 20:05:36
 WE SEE A SURGE IN AFTER HOURS
USAGE.
SO THOSE ARE THE PRIMARY

[Captioner] 20:05:39
 WAYS.
IT WOULD BE A CALL FOR SERVICE,
PART OF

[Captioner] 20:05:44
 ROUTINE PATROL IN THE
BEAT OR A SPECIAL ENFORCEMENT


[Captioner] 20:05:46
EFFORT.
>> Councilmember Salwan: SO IF A
RES DANT HAS A COMPLAINT, IS


[Captioner] 20:05:50
THERE A NUMBER THAT THEY CAN
CALL OR IS THAT READILY
AVAILABLE FOR MOST

[Captioner] 20:05:53
 FOLKS?


[Captioner] 20:05:56
>> YEAH, THERE IS A NUMBER, I'M
SORRY I DON'T HAVE IT WITH ME,


[Captioner] 20:05:59
BUT THERE'S A NUMBER AVAILABLE
ON OUR WEBSITE,

[Captioner] 20:06:03
 AND WE'VE GIVEN
THAT TO CITY STAFF IN THE PAST,
THAT THEY

[Captioner] 20:06:06
 CAN CALL TO OUR
DISPATCH CENTER,

[Captioner] 20:06:10
 YES.
>> Councilmember Salwan: THANK
YOU.


[Captioner] 20:06:13
THEN JUST THE EVOLUTION OF THE
HOURS, COULD YOU REMIND

[Captioner] 20:06:19
 ME
HOW -- WHAT THE ORIGINAL HOURS
WERE, I THINK WE'RE THE

[Captioner] 20:06:22
 A LIKE
6:30 TO 9:00 P.M.
IS THAT CORRECT?


[Captioner] 20:06:25
>> IT DEPENDS ON THE TIME OF


[Captioner] 20:06:29
YEAR, SO THERE ARE PEAK SEASON
HOURS, SUMMER

[Captioner] 20:06:35
 HOURS, FROM
APRIL 1ST TO DECEMBER 22ND,


[Captioner] 20:06:38
THAT'S 6:30 A.M. TO 9:00 P.M.,
OFF SEASON HOURS,

[Captioner] 20:06:41
 DECEMBER 23RD
TO MARCH 31ST ARE 6:30 TO
8:00 P.M.


[Captioner] 20:06:45
>> Councilmember Salwan: OKAY.
GREAT.


[Captioner] 20:06:48
>> AND IN REGARDS TO THE FIRST
PART OF YOUR

[Captioner] 20:06:52
 QUESTION, I BELIEVE
IT WAS 2014, THAT WE

[Captioner] 20:06:55
 MODIFIED
THE HOURS, AND I

[Captioner] 20:06:58
 BELIEVE AT THAT
POINT, I'M SORRY, I CAN'T


[Captioner] 20:07:01
REMEMBER THE STARTING HOURS IN
THE MORNING, BUT WE WERE MUCH


[Captioner] 20:07:04
LATER IN THE MORNING AND EARLIER
IN THE EVENING, AND THEN

[Captioner] 20:07:08
 WE
ADJUSTED THOSE HOURS

[Captioner] 20:07:11
 IN 2016, I
BELIEVE, AND WE'VE HAD THE
CURRENT

[Captioner] 20:07:14
 HOURS I BELIEVE SINCE
2016.
>> Councilmember Salwan: THANK


[Captioner] 20:07:18
YOU.
SO I GUESS -- SO PART OF

[Captioner] 20:07:21
 THAT
COMMUNITY'S ANGST IS THAT WE
WILL SIGN THIS LEASE

[Captioner] 20:07:23
 AGREEMENT
AND THEN THE HOURS WILL BE
CHANGED.


[Captioner] 20:07:27
IS THAT -- WHAT IS THE THINKING
ON THAT AND

[Captioner] 20:07:32
 WHY IS THERE -- WHY
IS IT OPEN-ENDED?
HOW IS THE

[Captioner] 20:07:35
 PARK DISTRICT
THINKING ABOUT THAT?


[Captioner] 20:07:40
>> WELL, COUNCILMEMBER, PART OF
THE REASON

[Captioner] 20:07:43
 WE DID INCLUDE THE
SPECIFIC HOURS IN

[Captioner] 20:07:46
 HERE IS THAT I
THINK THAT WAS A GOOD FAITH
EFFORT TO ADDRESS THE

[Captioner] 20:07:49

COMMUNITY'S CONCERNS.
I CAN TELL YOU FROM A STAFF'S


[Captioner] 20:07:53
PERSPECTIVE, THERE'S NO
DISCUSSION CURRENTLY ABOUT


[Captioner] 20:07:56
CHANGING THE HOURS, THEY SEEM TO
BE WORKING.
WHEN

[Captioner] 20:07:59
 WE ORIGINALLY ADJUSTED THE
HOURS IN 2016, THAT WAS BASED

[Captioner] 20:08:02
 ON
THE FACT THAT WE WERE HAVING A
LOT OF PEOPLE LIKE TO

[Captioner] 20:08:05
 GO UP AND
WATCH SUNSET AND WORK THEIR WAY
BACK DOWN TO THE PARKING

[Captioner] 20:08:09
 LOT, SO
WE DID AN

[Captioner] 20:08:12
 ADJUSTMENT TO MATCH
THAT COMMON USAGE OF THE PARK,
SO

[Captioner] 20:08:15
 I THINK AT THIS POINT,
THERE'S NO CURRENT CONVERSATIONS
ABOUT

[Captioner] 20:08:19
 CHANGING HOURS.
I THINK THEY'RE WORKING VERY


[Captioner] 20:08:26
WELL.
>> Councilmember Salwan: OKAY.
ON THE PRESENTATION,

[Captioner] 20:08:29
 THEY
MENTIONED THE LEASE TERMINATION.
IT

[Captioner] 20:08:33
 SAID, 30 DAYS WRITTEN NOTICE.
SO WHAT COST THAT EXACTLY MEAN?


[Captioner] 20:08:36
IF THE CITY OR THE PARK DISTRICT
HAS ANY ISSUE, THEY

[Captioner] 20:08:39
 CAN BE OF A
NOTICE THAT WITHIN 30 DAYS, THE
LEASE

[Captioner] 20:08:42
 WOULD BE TERMINATED, IS
THAT CORRECT?


[Captioner] 20:08:46
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: THERE'S
THREE WAYS THAT THE LEASE CAN BE
TERMINATED.


[Captioner] 20:08:49
JUST UPON EXPIRATION OF THE
TERM, WHEN

[Captioner] 20:08:52
 THERE IS A MATERIAL
BREACH, AND AFTER WE'VE ISSUED


[Captioner] 20:08:56
WRITTEN NOTICE.
SO FOR CAUSE.
AND THEN

[Captioner] 20:08:59
 JUST BY RIGHT, BY
ISSUING A 30-DAY WRITTEN

[Captioner] 20:09:01
 NOTICE
TO THE DISTRICT.
>> Councilmember Salwan: SO


[Captioner] 20:09:04
WHETHER WE HAVE A 25 OR

[Captioner] 20:09:07
 40-YEAR
LEASE, IF EITHER OF THE PARTIES


[Captioner] 20:09:10
IS DISSATISFIED, YOU CAN SEND A
LETTER AND HOPEFULLY

[Captioner] 20:09:14
 IT DOESN'T
COME TO THAT BECAUSE WE WANT TO
WORK TOGETHER, WE DON'T WANT

[Captioner] 20:09:17
 TO
THINK NEGATIVE, BUT THAT COULD
BE DONE AT

[Captioner] 20:09:20
 THE WORST POSSIBLE IF
THE SIDES CAN'T COME TOGETHER,
IS THAT CORRECT?


[Captioner] 20:09:24
>> CORRECT.
>> Councilmember Salwan: GREAT.
THEN THERE WAS THE MENTION ABOUT


[Captioner] 20:09:27
CAPITAL PROJECTS THAT WOULD
REQUIRE PERMITS.
SO JUST BE MORE SPECIFIC.


[Captioner] 20:09:31
SO WHAT ARE THE TYPE OF PROJECTS
THAT REQUIRE A BUILDING

[Captioner] 20:09:34
 PERMIT?
VERSUS ONES THAT ARE NOT?


[Captioner] 20:09:43
>> Ms. Wolf: THOSE ARE
STRUCTURAL IN NATURE.
THAT WOULD REQUIRE THE CITY TO


[Captioner] 20:09:46
HAVE PERMITS IF IT WAS SOMETHING


[Captioner] 20:09:53
STRUCTURAL OR REQUIRED BUILDING
PERMIT OR

[Captioner] 20:09:57
 REQUIRED CONDITIONAL
USE PERMIT PERHAPS FROM PLANNING


[Captioner] 20:10:00
DEPARTMENT, ANY OF THOSE THINGS
WOULD BE REQUIRED TO GO TO
COUNCIL, BUT TYPICALLY

[Captioner] 20:10:03
 THE
CAPITAL REPAIRS THAT WE WOULD
SEE

[Captioner] 20:10:06
 WOULD BE THINGS LIKE


[Captioner] 20:10:10
PLUMBING OR, YOU KNOW, CHANGES
TO THE

[Captioner] 20:10:13
 FENCE -- SOMETHING IS
BROKEN AND WE WANT TO FIX IT.
THOSE ARE THE

[Captioner] 20:10:17
 TYPICAL CAPITAL
REPAIRS WE WOULD WANT TO TALK
ABOUT THAT,

[Captioner] 20:10:21
 THAT WE WOULD WANT
TO HAVE SIMPLE RETEARS DONE AND
FIXED

[Captioner] 20:10:24
 QUICKLY AND THOSE ARE
ITEMS THAT WE WOULD APPROVE IN
THE SMALLER

[Captioner] 20:10:27
 TIME FRAME VERSUS
THE LONGER TIME FRAME.


[Captioner] 20:10:30
>> Councilmember Salwan: SO LIKE
ADDING BATHROOMS OR OTHER MAJOR


[Captioner] 20:10:34
PROJECTS THAT WOULD COME BEFORE
THE CITY FOR BUILDING

[Captioner] 20:10:36
 PERMIT, IS
THAT CORRECT?
>> THAT IS CORRECT.


[Captioner] 20:10:39
>> THANK YOU.
AND THEN THE LAST THING, MY
PERSONAL PASSION,

[Captioner] 20:10:42
 WE'VE BEEN
TALKING ABOUT PROMOTING THE


[Captioner] 20:10:45
OHLONE ENTRANCE.


[Captioner] 20:10:49
SOL EVERYBODY HOPES THAT
HAPPENS, BUT HOW CAN WE TANGIBLY
MAKE

[Captioner] 20:10:52
 THAT HAPPEN?
HOW DO WE AS THE PARK DISTRICT


[Captioner] 20:10:55
AND THE CITY, YOU KNOW,

[Captioner] 20:10:57
 FURTHER
PUSH OHLONE AS THE MAIN
ENTRANCE.


[Captioner] 20:11:01
SINCE FOR ME, IT'S A PERSONAL
PASSION BECAUSE WE HAVE THE
MISSION SAN JOSÉ DOWNTOWN,

[Captioner] 20:11:04
 WHICH
IS DEAD, IT LOOKS LIKE A
DOWNTOWN BUT WE

[Captioner] 20:11:07
 DON'T HAVE THE
BUSINESSES, AND WE HAVE SO MANY
PEOPLE THAT ARE COMING

[Captioner] 20:11:11
 TO
FREMONT FROM ALL OVER THE BAY


[Captioner] 20:11:14
EARL, BUT THEY END UP AT A
RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD.
SO HOW CAN

[Captioner] 20:11:17
 WE GET THOSE PEOPLE
TO THE MISSION SAN JOSÉ

[Captioner] 20:11:20
 DOWNTOWN
AREA?
SO I'D LIKE TO SEE HOW WE CAN


[Captioner] 20:11:24
MORE CONCRETELY TRY TO ADDRESS
THAT ISSUE, WHICH WOULD

[Captioner] 20:11:27
 SOLVE A
LOT OF OUR ISSUES.


[Captioner] 20:11:29
>> Ms. Wolf: THANK YOU FOR THAT
QUESTION.
THERE'S TWO THINGS I WOULD LIKE


[Captioner] 20:11:32
TO ADD.
ONE IS, WE DID HAVE


[Captioner] 20:11:35
CONVERSATIONS WITH DR. BISHOP
WHILE HE WAS HERE, AND I KNOW
EAST

[Captioner] 20:11:39
 BAY REGIONAL PARKS WAS
LEADING THAT EFFORT AND
DIALOGUE, BUT

[Captioner] 20:11:42
 WE ALSO ARE READY
TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION WITH


[Captioner] 20:11:45
DR. DESALVO, WHO IS NOW THE
INTERIM

[Captioner] 20:11:48
 PRESENT, AND BEGIN THE
PROCESS WORKING WITH EAST BAY
REGIONAL

[Captioner] 20:11:52
 PARKS AS WELL, SINCE
THIS IS THEIR SIDE

[Captioner] 20:11:53
 AGREEMENT, WE
KNOW THAT IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR
US.


[Captioner] 20:11:57
SO THERE'S A PARTNERSHIP THERE.
THE SECOND THING I JUST WANT TO


[Captioner] 20:12:00
MENTION IS THAT -- AND ECONOMIC
DEVELOPMENT DIRECTORIALLY

[Captioner] 20:12:09
 DIRECTOR LIZARRO IS
ON THE

[Captioner] 20:12:12
 CALL, AS PART OF BUILDING
OUR

[Captioner] 20:12:17
 OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVE
MISSION, THE MISSION AREA AND
HOW WE CAN

[Captioner] 20:12:20
 BUILD BACK BETTER,
REALLY SAW SOME OPPORTUNITIESING


[Captioner] 20:12:24
WITH MARKETING AND SIGNAGE WE
COULD BE REALLY CREATIVE

[Captioner] 20:12:27
 WITH,
SO I THINK THERE ARE

[Captioner] 20:12:31
 NEW
OPPORTUNITIES AND CONTINUE TO
WORK WITH THE NEW PRESIDENT

[Captioner] 20:12:34
 AND
THE NEW LEADERSHIP THERE

[Captioner] 20:12:38
 TO --
WE DO AGREE THAT HAS TO BE
MARKETED IN AND LIFTED

[Captioner] 20:12:41
 UP AS A
LOCATION FOR PEOPLE TO WANT TO
COME TO, IN ADDITION TO THE


[Captioner] 20:12:45
SIGNAGE, THAT EAST BAY REGIONAL
PARKS HAS ALREADY PUT ON TO THE


[Captioner] 20:12:52
STREET.
>> Councilmember Salwan: GREAT.
HOW ABOUT FROM MR. O'CONNOR'S


[Captioner] 20:12:55
SIDE, WHAT'S YOUR FEEDBACK AND
HOW CAN WE MAKE THIS MORE REAL?


[Captioner] 20:13:03
>> WELL, COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN,
WE HAVE BEEN WORKING CLOSELY
WITH THE

[Captioner] 20:13:06
 CITY STAFF FOR

[Captioner] 20:13:12
 YEARS
NOW AND IF THAT'S SOMETHING WE
CAN DO,

[Captioner] 20:13:15
 IT'S ACTUALLY CODIFIED
IN THE LEASE AGREEMENT, BUT
WE'RE MORE THAN WILLING TO WORK


[Captioner] 20:13:18
ON THAT, AND I ALSO SERVE AS THE
LIAISON

[Captioner] 20:13:21
 WITH OHLONE COLLEGE, AND


[Captioner] 20:13:25
SO WE DID MEET WITH DR. BISHOP
AND SABRINA

[Captioner] 20:13:28
 AND I AND JIM AND I
HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE

[Captioner] 20:13:33
 TO MEET
INTERIM PRESIDENT DESALVO, BUT
THAT WOULD BE ONE

[Captioner] 20:13:35
 OF THOSE
OPPORTUNITIES TO PROMOTE THAT
USE.


[Captioner] 20:13:41
>> Councilmember Salwan: GREAT,
THANK YOU.
I GUESS IF THERE'S

[Captioner] 20:13:44
 JUST A WAY TO
BRING ALL THE PARTIES TOGETHER,
I THINK THAT WOULD GO A

[Captioner] 20:13:47
 LONG
WAY, SO WITH THAT, I'LL CLOSE
THE COMMENTS

[Captioner] 20:13:50
 AND -- OR QUESTION,
I SHOULD SAY, AND TURN IT BACK
OVER TO THE MAYOR.


[Captioner] 20:13:54
THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: AT THIS TIME, I'D
LIKE

[Captioner] 20:14:00
 TO SEE -- DID YOU PUSH
THE -- OKAY.


[Captioner] 20:14:03
I APOLOGIZE, I DON'T SEE YOU ON
THE LIST.


[Captioner] 20:14:06
>> Vice Mayor Keng: THANK YOU,
MAYOR.
SO I DO HAVE A COUPLE MORE


[Captioner] 20:14:11
QUESTIONS, SOME OF THEM WERE NOT
COVERED.


[Captioner] 20:14:14
FIRST QUESTION IS DO WE HAVE ANY
RECENT

[Captioner] 20:14:18
 DATA HOW MANY OF THE
PARKING

[Captioner] 20:14:21
 SPACES AT THE OHLONE
PARKING LOT HAS BEEN

[Captioner] 20:14:24
 UTILIZED
VERSUS ON THE OTHER SIDE, THE
STANFORD

[Captioner] 20:14:27
 DRIVE, WHICH HAS CLOSE
TO 200 FREE

[Captioner] 20:14:31
 PARKING SPACES, I
KNOW THAT, YOU

[Captioner] 20:14:39
 KNOW, THIS PARK
HAS BEEN ONE OF THE MOST VISITED
PARKS IN

[Captioner] 20:14:42
 THE ENTIRE EAST BAY
REGIONAL PARK SYSTEM,

[Captioner] 20:14:46
 WHICH
IS -- IT'S GREAT TO SEE PEOPLE
VISITING THE PARKS BUT

[Captioner] 20:14:51
 IT ALSO
ADDS A HUGE BURDEN IN OUR
NEIGHBORHOODS, ESPECIALLY WHEN


[Captioner] 20:14:55
THE STANFORD SIDE PROVIDES FREE
PARKING, SO I

[Captioner] 20:14:59
 WANT TO -- FIRST
QUESTION IS IF WE HAVE DATA, HOW


[Captioner] 20:15:02
MANY SPACES HAVE BEEN

[Captioner] 20:15:06
 UTILIZED
ON THE OHLONE SIDE, OHLONE
PARKING

[Captioner] 20:15:09
 LOT SIDE?
SECOND QUESTION, IF WE MIGHT BE


[Captioner] 20:15:12
ABLE TO HAVE ANY UNDERSTANDING
IF

[Captioner] 20:15:17
 YOU HAVE ANY BUDGET SET ASIDE


[Captioner] 20:15:20
FOR MAINTAINING AND MANAGING
THIS PARK

[Captioner] 20:15:23
 SINCE IT'S -- BACK IN
2016 WAS THE LAST DATA

[Captioner] 20:15:27
 WE HAVE
ON THE ANNUAL

[Captioner] 20:15:32
 VISITORS 275,000
PEOPLE, MORE THAN A QUARTER
MILLION PEOPLE A YEAR, AND

[Captioner] 20:15:35
 I CAN
IMAGINE OVER THE PANDEMIC, MORE
PEOPLE HAVE

[Captioner] 20:15:38
 BEEN HEADING OUT TO
THE

[Captioner] 20:15:42
 PARK TO ALLOW OTHER SERVICES
TO WORK CLOSE.
SO

[Captioner] 20:15:45
 I THINK IT

[Captioner] 20:15:48
 IMPORTANT FOR US
TO SUCCEED THAT THE PARK CAN BE
WELL

[Captioner] 20:15:52
 MANAGED, AND MY THIRD


[Captioner] 20:15:57
QUESTION IS SOME OF THIS HAS
BEEN MENTIONED AND

[Captioner] 20:16:00
 EARLIER
MR. O'CONNOR MENTIONED THAT IN


[Captioner] 20:16:03
2021, THERE WERE 35 CITATIONS
ISSUED

[Captioner] 20:16:07
 AND 2022, 34 CITATIONS
ISSUED.
AND

[Captioner] 20:16:12
 I CAN SEE THAT THERE -- THIS
IS PROBABLY, YOU

[Captioner] 20:16:17
 KNOW, THE
VIOLATIONS THAT COULD

[Captioner] 20:16:23
 HAVE BEEN
CITED IN ONE DAY AND PEOPLE WERE
THERE SINCE 3:00 A.M.

[Captioner] 20:16:26
 UNTIL
MIDNIGHT, AND SO I

[Captioner] 20:16:30
 WANT TO GET A
BETTER UNDERSTANDING WHAT KIND
OF

[Captioner] 20:16:35
 METHODS AND FREQUENCY OF
ENFORCEMENT AND

[Captioner] 20:16:40
 TICKETING RG IN
THE PLANS TO SHA WE CAN MAKE
SURE THAT WE DON'T

[Captioner] 20:16:44
 ADD ALL
THE -- IF FOUR YEARS, IT

[Captioner] 20:16:47
 A
1 MILLION VISITOR VISIT TO THE
NEIGHBORHOOD.


[Captioner] 20:16:51
SO IT DEFINITELY A HUGE BURDEN
TO OUR NEIGHBORHOOD

[Captioner] 20:16:55
 AND THEY
SHOULDN'T BE BURDENING --


[Captioner] 20:16:58
SHOULDERING ALL THIS BURDEN FOR
THIS

[Captioner] 20:17:04
 PARK.
SO WE REALLY NEED TO HAVE KIND
OF A

[Captioner] 20:17:08
 BETTER PLAN.
AT THE LAST

[Captioner] 20:17:11
 REPORTING, IT WAS --
WE WERE TOLD THAT THERE HAS BEEN
LIMITED

[Captioner] 20:17:14
 SUCCESS OF MIGRATING
VISITORS TO THE

[Captioner] 20:17:18
 OHLONE COLLEGE
PARKING LOT,

[Captioner] 20:17:20
 SO WE REALLY NEED
TO HAVE A BETTER PLAN BEFORE WE
CAN MOVE FORWARD.


[Captioner] 20:17:29
THANK YOU.
>> I CAN ADDRESS SOME OF THAT


[Captioner] 20:17:33
QUESTION.
SO WE DON'T HAVE SPECIFIC DATA
ON THE

[Captioner] 20:17:37
 UTILIZATION OF THE 900
CAR PARKING LOT, WHICH IS
ADJACENT TO THE

[Captioner] 20:17:40
 PINE STREET
ENTRANCE AT OHLONE COLLEGE.
I

[Captioner] 20:17:43
 CAN TELL YOU THAT FOR THE
PERIOD OF OCTOBER

[Captioner] 20:17:48
 OF 2021
THROUGH OCTOBER

[Captioner] 20:17:51
 OF 2022, THERE
WAS A TOTAL OF 45,000

[Captioner] 20:17:53
 VISITORS
THAT USED THAT ENTRANCE INTO THE
PARK.


[Captioner] 20:17:57
AND THAT'S BASED ON TRAIL COUP

[Captioner] 20:18:00

COUNTER DATA THAT WE KEEP.


[Captioner] 20:18:03
IN COMPARISON,

[Captioner] 20:18:09
 AT STANFORD, THAT
SHOWED ALMOST 114,000

[Captioner] 20:18:13
 VISITORS
UTILIZING THAT ENTRANCE.
JUST AS A POINT OF REFERENCE, I


[Captioner] 20:18:16
DO HAVE SOME PAST DATA.


[Captioner] 20:18:19
IN 2014, THE STANFORD AVENUE
ENTRANCE -- EXCUSE

[Captioner] 20:18:22
 ME, THAT'S
INCORRECT.
LET ME GET THE RIGHT ONE HERE.


[Captioner] 20:18:28
SHOWED 228,000 VISITORS

[Captioner] 20:18:31
 USING
THAT IN 2014, SO YOU CAN SEE
THERE'S

[Captioner] 20:18:35
 BEEN A DOWNWARD TREND,
SOMETHING WE TALKED ABOUT
SEVERAL YEARS

[Captioner] 20:18:38
 AGO, AND SOME OF
THAT IS DUE TO PUSHING PEOPLE


[Captioner] 20:18:42
OVER TOWARDS THE PINE STREET
ENTRANCE AND THEN I

[Captioner] 20:18:45
 THINK SOME
OF IT IS DUE TO THE FACT THAT WE
HAVE THE PERMIT

[Captioner] 20:18:48
 PARKING IN
PLACE, WHICH IS

[Captioner] 20:18:52
 RESTRICTED THE
ENTRANCES AT STANFORD AVENUE.
SO AGAIN, IN TERMS

[Captioner] 20:18:57
 OF THE AFTER
HOURS ENFORCEMENT,

[Captioner] 20:19:00
 THERE ARE --
THERE'S THREE METHODOLOGIES.
THERE'S CALLS FOR

[Captioner] 20:19:04
 SERVICE THAT
CAN COME OUT OF THE
NEIGHBORHOOD, THERE'S

[Captioner] 20:19:08
 ROUTINE
PATROL THAT OUR OFFICERS
UNDERTAKE,

[Captioner] 20:19:11
 AND THEN WE CAN ALSO
DO TARGET ENFORCEMENT, AN A LOT


[Captioner] 20:19:14
OF

[Captioner] 20:19:17
 THAT IS OUT OF COOPERATION
BETWEEN OUR POLICE DEPARTMENTS
TALKING BACK AND FORTH ABOUT

[Captioner] 20:19:21
 THE
LEVEL OF COMPLAINTS THAT

[Captioner] 20:19:24
 ARE
COMING OUT OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD.
SO WE OFTEN --

[Captioner] 20:19:27
 OUR TWO POLICE
DEPARTMENTS TALK REGULARLY ABOUT


[Captioner] 20:19:31
THESE ISSUES, AND ALSO AS
SUZANNE

[Captioner] 20:19:34
 MENTIONED EARLIER, WE DO
HAVE THE LIAISON COMMITTEE.


[Captioner] 20:19:39
I'M NOT SURE IF THERE WAS A
THIRD QUESTION IN

[Captioner] 20:19:42
 THERE, VICE
MAYOR.
>> Vice Mayor Keng: SURE, GREAT,


[Captioner] 20:19:45
THANK YOU.
DO YOU HAVE AN ANNUAL BUDGET FOR


[Captioner] 20:19:48
MANAGING THIS PARK AND ALSO THE
FREQUENCY

[Captioner] 20:19:52
 OF PATROLLING?
THANK YOU.
>>

[Captioner] 20:19:55
 I DON'T HAVE THE SPECIFIC
FREQUENCY OF CONTROLS FOR THE
BEAT THAT

[Captioner] 20:19:58
 INCLUDES MISSION PEAK.
BUT I COULD

[Captioner] 20:20:01
 FORWARD THAT
INFORMATION TO YOU.


[Captioner] 20:20:04
IT DEPENDS OF COURSE ON
STAFFING.
OUR POLICE DEPARTMENT, I'M SURE


[Captioner] 20:20:08
MUCH LIKE YOUR OWN, HAS ITS
CHALLENGES

[Captioner] 20:20:11
 WITH RETENTION AND
STAFFING, SO

[Captioner] 20:20:14
 THAT CAN CHANGE
FROM TIME TO TIME.
IN TERMS OF

[Captioner] 20:20:18
 THE BUDGET, MISSION
PEAK IS PART OF A LARGER UNIT
THAT

[Captioner] 20:20:21
 INCLUDES SUNOL, REGIONAL


[Captioner] 20:20:25
WILDERNESS AND THE VARGAS
PLATEAU

[Captioner] 20:20:28
 AREA.
WE HAVE TWO SPECIFIC RANGER


[Captioner] 20:20:32
POSITIONS ASSIGNED TO MISSION
PEAK, AND WE

[Captioner] 20:20:35
 ESTIMATE THE BUDGET
WHETHER WE LOOK AT STAFF


[Captioner] 20:20:40
INCLUDING PUBLIC SAFETY IS
AROUND $450,000 ANNUALLY THAT

[Captioner] 20:20:44

WE -- JUST AND MISSION PEAK.


[Captioner] 20:20:49
>> Vice Mayor Keng: GREAT.
THANKS SO MUCH.
>> YOU'RE

[Captioner] 20:20:55
 WELCOMEMENT.
>> Mayor Mei: ANY OTHER COLLAR
GUYING QUESTIONS?


[Captioner] 20:21:03
HOW MANY SPEAKERS DO WE HAVE?
>> Ms. Gauthier: CURRENTLY THERE


[Captioner] 20:21:05
ARE FIVE, I BELIEVE, HANDS
RAISED.
I THINK YOU SAID A MINUTE


[Captioner] 20:21:09
EARLIER?
>> Mayor Mei: IF POSSIBLE,
BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO NEED A


[Captioner] 20:21:12
BREAK.
>> Ms. Gauthier: SORRY, THERE
ARE SEVERAL MORE

[Captioner] 20:21:14
 HANDS GOING UP
NOW.
OKAY.


[Captioner] 20:21:17
ONE MINUTE PER SPEAKER.
THE FIRST

[Captioner] 20:21:26
 SPEAKER IS SUNAINA AND


[Captioner] 20:21:29
KUSHAL VEPA.


[Captioner] 20:21:42
LAST NAME VEPA.
YOU NEED TO UNMUTE.


[Captioner] 20:21:45
YOUR TIMER WILL START.
>> YES, HI.


[Captioner] 20:21:48
THIS IS KUSHAL

[Captioner] 20:21:49
 VEPA.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE
TIME.


[Captioner] 20:21:53
I'VE BEEN A FREMONT RESIDENT FOR
15

[Captioner] 20:21:58
 YEARS.
AND YEAH, I WOULD BASICALLY LIKE
TO SAY THAT

[Captioner] 20:22:00
 WE AGREE WITH THE
COMMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE
BEFORE, AND

[Captioner] 20:22:04
 WE DEFINITELY LIKE
THE MISSION PEAK LEASE

[Captioner] 20:22:07
 WITH THE
EAST BAY REGIONAL PARK DISTRICT
TO BE

[Captioner] 20:22:10
 MODIFIED AND GET A LITTLE
BIT OF CLARIFICATION ABOUT

[Captioner] 20:22:16
 THE
HOURS OF THIS PARK.
WHEN WE LOOK AT MANY OF THE


[Captioner] 20:22:19
OTHER PARKS THROUGHOUT THE EAST
BAY, THEY

[Captioner] 20:22:23
 ACTUALLY HAVE CURFEW
FROM SUNSET TO

[Captioner] 20:22:28
 SUNRISE, SO IN A
RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD,
ESPECIALLY AT

[Captioner] 20:22:31
 THE STANFORD
STAGING AREA, THIS ACTUALLY HAS
A

[Captioner] 20:22:34
 WINDOW QUITE A BIT OUTSIDE
OTHER

[Captioner] 20:22:38
 PARKS IN THE COMMUNITY SO
I'D LIKE A LITTLE BIT OF


[Captioner] 20:22:41
CLARIFICATION ON THAT AS WELL AS
A LITTLE BIT MORE, THAT

[Captioner] 20:22:44
 THE
VERBIAGE IS STATED THAT A
PARKING FACILITY OR

[Captioner] 20:22:48
 PARKING
STRUCTURE NO GREATER THAN 300
SPACES

[Captioner] 20:22:51
 WOULD BE BUILT IN THE
STANFORD STAGING AREA.


[Captioner] 20:22:54
S TO THAT MEAN THAT THERE WOULD
BE CONSIDERATION FOR

[Captioner] 20:22:57
 A PARKING
STRUCTURE LESS THAN 300?


[Captioner] 20:23:05
>> Ms. Gauthier: THE NEXT
SPEAKER IS SURESH.


[Captioner] 20:23:13
SURESH, YOU NEED TO UNMUTE.
>> OKAY, HI.
THIS IS

[Captioner] 20:23:17
 SURESH.
I WANTED TO

[Captioner] 20:23:21
 CLARIFY, ALL OF THE
EAST BAY PARKS HAVE

[Captioner] 20:23:24
 CURFEW HOURS
OF 10:00 P.M. TO 5:00 A.M.
MISSION PEAK IS

[Captioner] 20:23:28
 THE ONLY ONE
THAT HAS LONGER CURFEW HOURS
STARTING

[Captioner] 20:23:32
 AT 9:00 P.M. IN SUMMER
AND 8:00 P.M.

[Captioner] 20:23:34
 IN WINTER.
AND THEN GOING UP TO

[Captioner] 20:23:37
 6:30 A.M.
SO THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER WAS
TOTALLY WRONG,

[Captioner] 20:23:41
 HE'S MISINFORMED.
SECONDLY, I WANTED TO POINT OUT
THAT

[Captioner] 20:23:44
 THE COMMUNITY IS THE
COMMUNITY OF ALAMEDA

[Captioner] 20:23:47
 COUNTY AND
CONTRA COSTA, ENTIRE COUNTY, ALL


[Captioner] 20:23:50
THE RESIDENTS PAY TAXES FOR EAST


[Captioner] 20:23:54
BAY PARK DISTRICT, AND THEY HAVE
AS MUCH RIGHT TO ENJOY

[Captioner] 20:23:57
 THE
MISSION PEAK AS THE NAYS WHO
LIVE

[Captioner] 20:24:00
 NEAR STANFORD.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:24:04
>> Ms. Gauthier: THANK YOU.
THE NEXT SPEAKER

[Captioner] 20:24:08
 IS WILLIAM


[Captioner] 20:24:10
YRAGUI.
>> THANK YOU, MISSION PEAK
CONSERVANCY.


[Captioner] 20:24:13
WE WERE FORMED IN 2014, WHEN THE


[Captioner] 20:24:17
CITY AND EAST BAY REGIONAL
NEGOTIATED WITH NEIGHBORS BUT
DID

[Captioner] 20:24:20
 NOT INCLUDE VISITORS, SO WE
WERE

[Captioner] 20:24:24
 FORMED IN -- HONESTLY WE
SUPPORT THE

[Captioner] 20:24:27
 LEASE AND RENEWAL.
EAST BAY REGIONAL DOES A
FANTASTIC

[Captioner] 20:24:30
 JOB OF MANAGING THE
PARK.
SPECIFICALLY THE TRAILS ARE

[Captioner] 20:24:34
 WIDE
AT MISSION PEAK, ELEVATION GAIN
IS

[Captioner] 20:24:38
 SIGNIFICANT.
THEY'VE DONE A VERY GOOD JOB OF
CONTROLLING USE

[Captioner] 20:24:41
 TRAILS.
THE ONE ISSUE HERE IS PARKING,
AND PARKING IS AN ISSUE AT

[Captioner] 20:24:44
 ALL
OF THE REGIONAL PARKS.
IN FACT, COYOTE HILLS,

[Captioner] 20:24:48
 WHICH IS
TERESA KING'S AREA, THAT PARK

[Captioner] 20:24:51
 IS
CLOSED THE SECOND MOST OF THE 73 PARK

[Captioner] 20:24:55
 SYSTEM, IT IS CLOSED TWO
TO THREE TIMES A WEEK DUE TO
PARKING

[Captioner] 20:24:58
 CONGESTION AND THE LACK
OF PARKING.
SO THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT AFFECTS


[Captioner] 20:25:01
ALL THE PARKS.
YOU KNOW, HONESTLY,

[Captioner] 20:25:05
 VARGAS
PLATEAU ONLY HAS 25 SPACES OF


[Captioner] 20:25:08
PARKING, SO WE REALLY NEED TO
LOOK AT PARKING AS AN

[Captioner] 20:25:09
 ISSUE.
THANK YOU.
>> Ms. Gauthier: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:25:12
THE NEXT SPEAKER IS

[Captioner] 20:25:16
 J

[Captioner] 20:25:20
 JANET B.


[Captioner] 20:25:24
JANET?
JANET B?
YOU NEED

[Captioner] 20:25:27
 TO UNMUTE.


[Captioner] 20:25:35
>> SORRY ABOUT THAT.
I WAS HAVING TROUBLE WITH THE
TECHNOLOGY HERE.


[Captioner] 20:25:38
THANK YOU, MAYOR MEI AND CITY
COUNCILMEMBERS

[Captioner] 20:25:44
 FOR OPPORTUNITY
TO SPEAK.
THERE ARE MANY FREMONT

[Captioner] 20:25:48
 RESIDENTS
THAT ARE CONCERNED ABOUT

[Captioner] 20:25:53
 THE
VIOLATIONS AND THE NEED TO
EFFECTIVELY

[Captioner] 20:25:56
 ADDRESS THE HOURS
AND THE MAINTENANCE.
THESE ARE

[Captioner] 20:25:58
 LINGERING ISSUES THAT
MUST BE ADDRESSED TO PROVIDE
BALANCE.


[Captioner] 20:26:03
GIVING THE PARK DISTRICT
EX-CLUES

[Captioner] 20:26:06

EXCLUSIVE CONTROL EFFECTIVELY
GRANTS TO

[Captioner] 20:26:09
 MAINTAIN THE STATUS
QUO, CONTINUE TO IGNORE RAMPANT
CURFEW

[Captioner] 20:26:13
 VIOLATIONS, EXTEND THE
HOURS WITH 30 DAYS NOTICE, AS


[Captioner] 20:26:16
NOTED IN TERM NUMBER 10 WHICH
FURTHER CONTRIBUTES TO

[Captioner] 20:26:18
 THE
CURFEW CREEP.
THIS ENTRANCE REALLY NEEDS


[Captioner] 20:26:23
EFFECTIVE CURFEW MANAGEMENT, NOT
BASED ON LOCAL

[Captioner] 20:26:25
 CALLS TO
COMPLAIN, AND PERMANENT HOURS.
IF THE HOURS ARE WORKING, PLEASE


[Captioner] 20:26:29
HAVE THE BOARD MAKE THEM
PERMANENT.
THIS WILL HELP

[Captioner] 20:26:32
 MIGRATE THE
TRAFFIC TO

[Captioner] 20:26:35
 OHLONE AND REDUCE THE
ONGOING ABUSE AT THIS ENTRANCE.


[Captioner] 20:26:38
IN A MANNER CONSISTENT WITH ALL
OTHER PARKS, THAT'S

[Captioner] 20:26:42
 NOT
CONSISTENT.
IT'S --


[Captioner] 20:26:45
>> Ms. Gauthier: KELLY ABREU IS
THE NEXT SPEAKER.


[Captioner] 20:26:59
KELLY ABREU?
>> THANK YOU.
THE NORMAL CURFEW HOURS AT

[Captioner] 20:27:01
 OTHER
PARKS IN FREMONT IS 5:00 A.M. TO
10:00 P.M.


[Captioner] 20:27:06
THAT'S COYOTE HILLS AND QUARRY
LAKES.
THIS LEASE IS

[Captioner] 20:27:09
 ACTUALLY NOT
LONGER THAN OTHER PARKS.
ARDENWOOD HAS A

[Captioner] 20:27:12
 LEASE OF 40 OR
50 YEARS, ARDENWOOD HISTORICAL


[Captioner] 20:27:15
PARK.
AND SOME PEOPLE LIKE
COUNCILMEMBER JONES SAY

[Captioner] 20:27:18
 THAT EBR
PIVs

[Captioner] 20:27:21
 AGREED NOT TO IMPROVE
PARKING AND MR. ALVARADO, HE


[Captioner] 20:27:24
SAYS THE STANDALONE LETTER
ARISES OUT OF THE LEASE.
YOU

[Captioner] 20:27:27
 KNOW, IF YOU LOOK AT
ITEM 20, IT SAYS THIS LEASE
INCLUDING

[Captioner] 20:27:31
 ALL DOCUMENTS
INCORPORATED HEREIN BY
REFERENCES COMPRISES

[Captioner] 20:27:35
 THE ENTIRE
INTEGRATED UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN
THE PARTIES

[Captioner] 20:27:38
 CONCERNING THE
SERVICES

[Captioner] 20:27:43
 DESCRIBED HEREIN.
REGARDING LEASE OF

[Captioner] 20:27:46
 THE PROPERTY
WHETHER WRITTEN OR ORAL.
SO

[Captioner] 20:27:49
 I URGE YOU TO PLEASE LOOK AT
THIS LEASE AND

[Captioner] 20:27:53
 CONSIDER IT ON
ITS OWN, AND THIS IS EVERYTHING
IN

[Captioner] 20:27:56
 HERE IS WHAT COUNTS.
NOT ANYTHING OUTSIDE.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:28:03
>> Ms. Gauthier: STEVE SKALA IS
THE NEXT SPEAKER.
>>

[Captioner] 20:28:06
 YES.
THANK YOU, STEVE SKALA, RESIDENT
OF

[Captioner] 20:28:09
 FREMONT.
SO BEEN

[Captioner] 20:28:12
 A RESIDENT OF FREMONT
FOR CLOSE

[Captioner] 20:28:16
 TO 25 YEARS, THE
STANFORD STAGING AREA WAS I
THINK

[Captioner] 20:28:18
 THE FIRST PLACE IN FREMONT
I WENT TO.
THERE WERE NO HOUSES THEN,


[Captioner] 20:28:22
CERTAINLY NOT ALONG STANFORD
AVENUE.
YOU CAN COME AND GO AS

[Captioner] 20:28:25
 YOU
PLEASE.
THOSE HOUSES WERE NOT STARTER


[Captioner] 20:28:29
HOUSES, IF THEY WERE STARTER
HOUSES I WOULD HAVE TRIED TO BUY
ONE.


[Captioner] 20:28:32
I COULDN'T.
IT SEEMS LIKE WE HAVE LESS

[Captioner] 20:28:36
 THAN
200 PEOPLE IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD,
AND THEY'RE

[Captioner] 20:28:39
 TAKING PRECEDENCE
OVER A CITY

[Captioner] 20:28:42
 OF 200,000.
WE SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO THIS
PARK,

[Captioner] 20:28:46
 REGARDING THE HOURS, I
MADE MY PEACE

[Captioner] 20:28:49
 LAST YEAR WHEN I
CAN'T GET DOWN THE HILL

[Captioner] 20:28:53
 BY
8:00 FROM THE HORSE HEAVEN
TRAIL, I'LL

[Captioner] 20:28:56
 JUST PAY YOUR $300
BECAUSE I FOUND

[Captioner] 20:28:59
 OUT IT COSTS A
LOT LESS THAN PUSHING MY

[Captioner] 20:29:02
 KNEES
AND PAIN IN PHYSICAL THERAPY.
SO WE SHOULD

[Captioner] 20:29:06
 BE KEEPING ACCESS,
NOT REDUCING ACCESS.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:29:09
>> Ms. Gauthier: THE NEXT
SPEAKER IS

[Captioner] 20:29:14
 RAJUL PATHAK.
>> HI, THANK YOU FOR THE
OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK.


[Captioner] 20:29:17
I WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK ABOUT
PERMIT

[Captioner] 20:29:19
 PARKING AND STREET
PARKING AT OUR STANFORD
ENTRANCE.


[Captioner] 20:29:23
I'D LIKE TO REJECT THAT LEASE AS
PROPOSED.


[Captioner] 20:29:26
THE LEASE IS SILENT ON THE


[Captioner] 20:29:29
SUBJECT OF PERMIT PARKING AND
THERE'S NO FIRM COMMITMENT SO
I'D

[Captioner] 20:29:32
 LIKE TO SEE THE CONTINUATION
OF THE PERMIT PARKING PROGRAM
AND

[Captioner] 20:29:36
 INCLUDED IN THE LEASE.
ALSO WANT -- TO BECOME

[Captioner] 20:29:40
 MORE
PARKING ON BOTH SIDE, WE WANT


[Captioner] 20:29:44
THE ENTIRE TO BE NON-PARKING
JUST AS WE'VE ALREADY

[Captioner] 20:29:47
 DONE FOR
STANFORD

[Captioner] 20:29:51
 AVENUE

[Captioner] 20:29:54
 DANGEROUS
PARKING SITUATIONS, LOTS OF
HARASSMENT,

[Captioner] 20:29:58
 NOISE, TRASH,
SECURITY ISSUES.
WE HAVE LOTS OF CARS HERE,

[Captioner] 20:30:01
 SO
PLEASE MAKE NO

[Captioner] 20:30:03
 PARKING STREET
AND INCLUDE PERMIT PARKING IN
THE LEASE.


[Captioner] 20:30:06
THANK YOU.
>> Ms. Gauthier: THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 20:30:20

[Captioner] 20:30:24
 I
OPPOSE THE PROPOSED MISSION PEAK
LEASE WITH EAST

[Captioner] 20:30:27
 BAY PARK
DISTRICT.
PARK DISTRICT HAS FAILED

[Captioner] 20:30:31
 TO
ADDRESS CURFEW VIOLATION FOR THE
LONGEST

[Captioner] 20:30:34
 TIME.
LAST SATURDAY AT 5:30 A.M.,
LOOKING FROM OUTSIDE

[Captioner] 20:30:37
 THE
STANDARD STAGING AREA, THERE
WERE AT

[Captioner] 20:30:40
 LEAST FIVE VEEKS IN THE
PARKING LOT, A

[Captioner] 20:30:44
 FLAGRANT
VIOLATION.
ADDITIONALLY, THERE WERE ANOTHER


[Captioner] 20:30:47
25 EMPTY VEHICLES PARKED.


[Captioner] 20:30:50
THE OCCUPANTS WERE HIKING UP THE


[Captioner] 20:30:54
MISSION SUMMIT AS FLASHES OF
LIGHTS WERE GLEAMING IN THE
DARKNESS ALONG

[Captioner] 20:30:57
 THE TRAIL.
A LIGHT

[Captioner] 20:31:00
 MONITORING AND LIGHT
ENFORCEMENT COMES WITH A PRICE.
ON

[Captioner] 20:31:04
 MAY 2,021ST AT AROUND
5:00 A.M., THERE WAS THIS FIRE
JUST

[Captioner] 20:31:08
 OFF THE MAIN

[Captioner] 20:31:11
 TRAIL --
INSIDE THE PARK, THE WINDS IN
THE AREA

[Captioner] 20:31:15
 WERE FASCINATING, TO
GET THE SLOW SPREADING FIRE.


[Captioner] 20:31:17
WE MIGHT NOT BE SO LUCKY NEXT
TIME.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:31:22
>> Ms. Gauthier: THANK YOU.

OPPORTUNITY TO COMMENT.
I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT

[Captioner] 20:31:40
 THIS IS
THE ONLY ENTRANCE THAT

[Captioner] 20:31:43
 IS FREE
AND THE ONLY ONE IN YOUR
RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD, SO

[Captioner] 20:31:46
 WE
HAVE ALMOST A THOUSAND VISITORS
A DAY,

[Captioner] 20:31:51
 THAT'S 365,000 VISITORS A
DAY.
WE NEED TO PUT A

[Captioner] 20:31:54
 CAP ON THE
NUMBER OF VISITORS THAT CAN
VISIT PER

 DAY.
AUTOMATIC LOCKING GATE, UPDATE


[Captioner] 20:32:01

TO SEE HOW MANY VISITORS COME


[Captioner] 20:32:04
IN, AND WHAT'S THE LIMIT OF


[Captioner] 20:32:07
VISITORS IN, THE GATE SHOULD
CLOSE.


[Captioner] 20:32:11
AND ALSO DO YOU HAVE WITH SO
MANY VISITORS AND CARS

[Captioner] 20:32:14
 LINED UP,
DO YOU HAVE ANY EVACUATION

[Captioner] 20:32:17
 PLANS
FOR THE CITY, YOU KNOW, ON THE

MANY SPEAKERS HAVE

[Captioner] 20:32:56
 SPOKEN ALL
THE THINGS I WANTED TO SAY.
I WOULD LIKE TO

[Captioner] 20:32:59
 REJECT THE LEASE
WITHOUT A

[Captioner] 20:33:03
 WRITTEN PROVISION.
AS

[Captioner] 20:33:06
 TO HOW

[Captioner] 20:33:09
 THE VIOLATIONS OF
CURFEW ARE

[Captioner] 20:33:15
 REPORTED BETWEEN THE
PARK DISTRICT

[Captioner] 20:33:18
 AND THE CITY?
IT GOES ONLY TO THE

[Captioner] 20:33:22
 PARK
DISTRICT, AND CITY IS

[Captioner] 20:33:25
 TOTALLY IN
THE DARK AND HOW WOULD THE CITY


[Captioner] 20:33:29
KNOW THAT THE CURFEW

[Captioner] 20:33:32
 IS BEING
REALLY MONITORED AND ENFORCED?


[Captioner] 20:33:36
SO THAT NEEDS TO GO IN,
OTHERWISE IT'S

[Captioner] 20:33:38
 A MEANINGLESS
EXERCISE.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

[Captioner] 20:33:57
TIME, MAYOR AND CITY
COUNCILMEMBER.
THE LANGUAGE IN ITEM 1, THE

[Captioner] 20:34:00
 PARK
DISTRICT SHOULD HAVE EXCLUSIVE
CONTROL AND THE

[Captioner] 20:34:03
 SOLE

[Captioner] 20:34:06
 AUTHORITY
TO -- I USED TO WORRY ABOUT THIS
LANGUAGE BECAUSE

[Captioner] 20:34:09
 IF THE PARK
WERE TO CHANGE THE HOURS, EVEN
THOUGH THEY SAY

[Captioner] 20:34:13
 WE HAVE A WRIT
EVAN -- THEY

[Captioner] 20:34:16
 HAVE A RIGHT TO
NOTIFY THE CITY IN 30 DAYS, I'M
NOT SURE WHAT

[Captioner] 20:34:19
 ARE THE
RAMIFICATIONS OR THE RESOLUTION
THAT

[Captioner] 20:34:22
 CAN COME OUT WITH -- IT
SEEMS LIKE WE EITHER DO NOTHING
OR

[Captioner] 20:34:25
 WE GO FOR THE NEW CLEAR


[Captioner] 20:34:29
OPTION OF TERMINATING THE LEASE.
THE OTHER

[Captioner] 20:34:32
 ISSUES I HAVE IS
REGARDING TO THE CURFEW TIME

[Captioner] 20:34:35
 TOO
THAT MANY PEOPLE HAVE MENTIONED.
IN SUMMER

[Captioner] 20:34:38
 IF I HIKE DOWN FROM
MISSION PEAK

[Captioner] 20:34:42
 AT 8:55, I NORMALLY
SEE QUITE A BIT OF CARS STILL IN
THE PARKING LOT.


[Captioner] 20:34:46
AND IF YOU STAYED IN, I'M SURE
THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE WOULD

[Captioner] 20:34:49
 ARE
VIOLATING THE CURFEW.
SO I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING

[Captioner] 20:34:51
 THAT
WOULD NEED TO BE DONE THERE.
>> Ms. Gauthier: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:34:54
THE NEXT SPEAKER IS GARY PARICH.


[Captioner] 20:34:58
>> CAN YOU HEAR ME?
>> Ms. Gauthier: 

[Captioner] 20:35:01
YES.
>> THANK

[Captioner] 20:35:04
 YOU FOR GIVING THIS
OPPORTUNITY FOR ME TO SPEAK.
I'VE GOT ONLY ONE MINUTE WHICH


[Captioner] 20:35:08
IS NOT ENOUGH FOR AN IMPORTANT
SUBJECT LIKE THIS.


[Captioner] 20:35:12
HOWEVER, ITEM 5 IN THE LEAVES,
I'M NOT SURE WHY THERE

[Captioner] 20:35:15
 ARE SIDE
LETTERS, SIDEBAR ISSUES,

[Captioner] 20:35:19
 SIDE
NEGOTIATIONS, BEING DONE ON THE
PARKING LOT, I THINK THAT CAN

[Captioner] 20:35:22
 BE
EASILY CORRECTED BY MAKING A
STATEMENT RIGHT UP FRONT, NO


[Captioner] 20:35:26
PARKING LOT OF ANY KIND OR SIZE


[Captioner] 20:35:29
SHALL BE -- THIS SHALL BE LEFT
NATURAL OTHER THAN MAINTENANCE


[Captioner] 20:35:32
REQUIREMENTS.
BOTH AGENCIES ARE TRYING TO
AWARD THIS

[Captioner] 20:35:36
 CREST CAL TOPIC BY
PUTTING A SIDEBAR LETTER AND

[Captioner] 20:35:38
 NOT
LETTING THE PEOPLE KNOW WHAT THE
LETTER SPHAIS.


[Captioner] 20:35:42
IT'S NOT FAIR.
THIS IS NOT

[Captioner] 20:35:45
 ENFORCEABLE IF THE
COUNCIL CHANGES OR THE

[Captioner] 20:35:48
 PARK
BOARD CHANGES, THEY'LL ALL


[Captioner] 20:35:51
FORGET ABOUT IT.
THE LEASE AGREEMENT IS FINE BUT
THE LETTER IS NULL AND

[Captioner] 20:35:55
 VOID.
SECOND LOOK AT THE INSURANCE
LIMIT.


[Captioner] 20:35:58
IT'S NOT ENOUGH.
NOT ENOUGH FOR ANY

[Captioner] 20:36:02
 OF THESE
LIABILITIES THAT THE CITY OR THE
PARK

[Captioner] 20:36:05
 HAS.
>> Ms. Gauthier: THANK YOU.
THE LAST SPEAKER IS ANU

[Captioner] 20:36:09
 ASOKAN.


[Captioner] 20:36:13
>> HELLO.
WE WOULD LIKE TO JUST

[Captioner] 20:36:19
 SAY THAT
THE EAST BAY DISTRICT AND CITY
OF FREMONT SHOULD INCREASE


[Captioner] 20:36:22
ACCESS TO ALL THESE PARKS.
AGAIN, THIS IS A CITY

[Captioner] 20:36:26
 OF 200,000
PEOPLE WHO ARE ALL PAYING TAXES,


[Captioner] 20:36:29
AND WE SHOULD ALL GET ACCESS TO
OUR GREEN SPACES.


[Captioner] 20:36:38
AND THIS ALL CHOSE TO LIVE IN
THIS AREA RIGHT NEXT TO THIS
BEAUTIFUL

[Captioner] 20:36:41
 PARK.
THEY CHOSE TO COME THERE KNOWING
THAT

[Captioner] 20:36:44
 IT LIKE A POPULAR PARK THAT
PEOPLE WOULD WANT TO VISIT.


[Captioner] 20:36:47
SO THEY WANT TO LIMIT PARKING,
THEY WANT TO LIMIT

[Captioner] 20:36:51
 CURFEWS, AND
THEY'RE NOT COCKING UP WITH ANY
SOLUTIONS FOR

[Captioner] 20:36:54
 ALLOWING THE REST
OF US TAXPAYERS TO ACCESS THIS
PARK.


[Captioner] 20:36:58
SO WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE
PARKING AND

[Captioner] 20:37:02
 MORE ACCESSIBILITY,
AND IT SHOULD BE

[Captioner] 20:37:05
 FREE ACCESS,
NOT JUST THE $4 AT

[Captioner] 20:37:08
 OHLONE.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:37:13
>> Ms. Gauthier: THANK YOU.
MAYOR, THAT'S THE LAST SPEAKER,
IF YOU'D LIKE TO

[Captioner] 20:37:16
 CLOSE PUBLIC
COMMENT?
>> Mayor Mei: YES, PLEASE.


[Captioner] 20:37:19
>> Ms. Gauthier: OKAY.
WE

[Captioner] 20:37:24
 ARE AT -- OVER AN HOUR AND A
HALF, IF WE CAN PLEASE TAKE
ABOUT

[Captioner] 20:37:27
 A 10-MINUTE BREAK FOR OUR


[Captioner] 20:37:29
STENOCAPTIONER?
>> Mayor Mei: YES, PLEASE.
>> Ms. Gauthier: THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 20:39:04
[ RECESS ]

[Captioner] 20:53:09
 FREMONT CITY COUNCIL.


[Captioner] 20:54:11
N NO AUDIO ]

[Captioner] 20:56:37

[ NO AUDIO ]

[Captioner] 20:57:15
 SERVICE, PATROLS OF 
THE OFFICERS THAT ARE

[Captioner] 20:57:18
 ASSIGNED 
TO THOSE AREAS AND ALSO OFTEN 
TARGET ID ENFORCEMENT

[Captioner] 20:57:21
.
IT'S NOT SOMEWHERE YOU CAN BE, 
YOU CAN'T

[Captioner] 20:57:24
 BE EVERYWHERE ALL THE 
TIME,

[Captioner] 20:57:28
 IT'S JUST NOT REALITY.
THIS WAS AN

[Captioner] 20:57:31
 AMENITY AS ONE 
CALLER ALLUDED TO BEFORE THERE

[Captioner] 20:57:33
 
WERE RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENTS 
THIS THAT AREA AT ALL.


[Captioner] 20:57:36
THE ONLY THING DOWN THERE WAS

[Captioner] 20:57:43
 
STANFORD WINERY.
AND IN THE BEGINNING

[Captioner] 20:57:46
 SOME OF 
THOSE RESIDENTS PROBABLY ENJOYED 
HIKING

[Captioner] 20:57:49
 TO MISSION PEAK BUT AGAIN 
WITH SOCIAL MEDIA IT HAS

[Captioner] 20:57:52
 BECOME 
MUCH MORE POPULAR.
I THINK THE EAST BAY

[Captioner] 20:57:55
 REGIONAL 
PARKS AND FREMONT HAVE DONE A 
GREAT

[Captioner] 20:57:58
 JOB OF TRYING TO BALANCE 
THE ENFORCEMENT ISSUES DOWN 
THERE, TO

[Captioner] 20:58:01
 ADDRESS THE RESIDENTS' 
CONCERNS,

[Captioner] 20:58:05
 TO MAKE SURE THAT 
THINGS ARE

[Captioner] 20:58:08
 DONE IN A TIMELY 
MANNER.
BUT AGAIN, IT ALL

[Captioner] 20:58:11
 DEPENDS ON 
RESOURCES AND STAFFING LEVELS.
AND IT

[Captioner] 20:58:15
 ALSO DEPENDS ON THE 
RESIDENTS CALLING IN AND 
REPORTING THESE ISSUES

[Captioner] 20:58:19
.

[Captioner] 20:58:24

SO I DON'T KNOW THAT THERE IS 
ANYWHERE IN THE CITY THAT

[Captioner] 20:58:27
 
ACTUALLY REQUIRES PERMIT 
PARKING, THAT WAS A

[Captioner] 20:58:31
 QUESTION 
THAT CAME UP AS WELL, AND THAT 
WAS ADDRESSED BY

[Captioner] 20:58:34
 DEPUTY CHIEF 
BREED AND THAT WAS SOMETHING 
THAT IS COMING BACK

[Captioner] 20:58:37
 TO THIS 
COUNCIL IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF

[Captioner] 20:58:40
 
NEXT YEAR.
THAT PROGRAM IS LIKELY TO BE 


[Captioner] 20:58:44
EXTENDED, I KNOW THAT THE CITY 
HAS HIRED TWO MORE PARK

[Captioner] 20:58:47
ING 
ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS AND THEIR 
ONLY RESPONSIBILITIES,

[Captioner] 20:58:50
 THE ONLY 
PERMIT PARKING AREAS WE HAVE ARE 
STANFORD

[Captioner] 20:58:54
 AND THE BUS-THE TRAIN 
DEPOT

[Captioner] 20:58:58
 IN CENTERVILLE.
SO THERE ARE OTHER DUTIES

[Captioner] 20:59:02
 BUT 
THOSE ARE PRIMARILY THE PEOPLE 
THAT ARE

[Captioner] 20:59:05
 GOING TO BE RESPONDING 
TO ALL OF THESE COMPLAINTS.
SO HOPEFULLY, THAT WILL

[Captioner] 20:59:08
 BE 
SOMETHING THAT, YOU KNOW, 
ADDRESSES SOME

[Captioner] 20:59:12
 OF THE ISSUES 
THAT THE RESIDENTS HAVE 
REGARDING THE PARKING, THE

[Captioner] 20:59:15
 
OVERCROWDING, THE TRAFFIC AND 
WHAT HAVE YOU.


[Captioner] 20:59:18
THERE WAS A COMMENT ABOUT HOW 
MANY CITATIONS WERE ISSUED

[Captioner] 20:59:21
 FOR 
CURFEW VIOLATIONS.
AND AGAIN THAT COMES DOWN

[Captioner] 20:59:25
 TO 
DOES AN OFFICER ON PATROL

[Captioner] 20:59:28
 FOR 
THAT AREA SEE THE VIOLATION, 
DOES SOMEONE CALL

[Captioner] 20:59:31
 AND REPORT IT?
IS EAST BAY

[Captioner] 20:59:34
 REGIONAL ALREADY 
THERE ON A TARGETED ENFORCEMENT 
ISSUE?


[Captioner] 20:59:37
THERE ARE A LOT OF VARIABLES 
OFTEN THAT AND YOU'RE

[Captioner] 20:59:40
 NEVER 
GOING TO MAKE EVERYBODY HAPPY 
WITH THIS TYPE OF AN

[Captioner] 20:59:43
 ISSUE.
BUT AGAIN THIS IS AN AMENITY 
THAT OUR RESIDENTS

[Captioner] 20:59:46
 AND RESIDENTS 
THROUGHOUT THE BAY AREA HAVE 
ENJOYED FOR MORE THAN 44

[Captioner] 20:59:51
 YEARS.
AND

[Captioner] 20:59:56
 I DON'T SEE A SOLUTION THAT 
IS GOING TO MAKE EVERYBODY

[Captioner] 20:59:59
 HAPPY 
BUT I THINK THAT WHAT THE

[Captioner] 21:00:03
 EAST 
BAY REGIONAL PARKS DISTRICT AND 
THE CITY HAVE COME UP WITH

[Captioner] 21:00:06
 IS 
PROBABLY THE BEST SOLUTION FOR 
THIS TIME.

[Captioner] 21:00:10

AND I WOULD BE VERY SUPPORTIVE 
OF MOVING THIS

[Captioner] 21:00:13
 FORWARD AND I'D 
BE COMPLETELY IN AGREEMENT WITH

[Captioner] 21:00:17
 
A 20 YEAR TERM, HISTORICALLY WE 
HAVE DONE 25

[Captioner] 21:00:21
 ISSUES AND THERE 
HAVEN'T BEEN THIS MANY ISSUES

[Captioner] 21:00:24
.
I WOULD BE IN AGREEMENT WITH 20 
YEAR

[Captioner] 21:00:28
 TERM, DOING THIS FOR LONGER 
WOULD BE UN

[Captioner] 21:00:31
FAVORABLE FOR BOTH OF 
THESE AGENCIES AND I WOULD BE IN

[Captioner] 21:00:34
 
FAVOR OF MOVING THIS FORWARD.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 21:00:37
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU, NEXT 
IS COUNCILMEMBER

[Captioner] 21:00:41
 KENG.
>> Vice Mayor Keng:   THANK YOU 
MAYOR.

[Captioner] 21:00:44

IT'S GREAT TO SEE THIS PARK, 
MISSION PEAK HAS BECOME

[Captioner] 21:00:47
 PRETTY 
MUCH DESTINATIONS

[Captioner] 21:00:51
, MOVING 
FORWARD,

[Captioner] 21:00:54
 THE LEASE, WE'RE GLAD 
TO HAVE THE PARTNERSHIP OF

[Captioner] 21:00:58
 EAST 
BAY REGIONAL PARKS AND THEY HAVE 
REALLY

[Captioner] 21:01:01
 DONE A GREAT JOB WITH

[Captioner] 21:01:04
 
COYOTE HILLS, QUARRY LAKES BUT I 
THINK WITH THE

[Captioner] 21:01:07
 NUMBER OF 
VISITORS THAT ARE VISITING EVERY 
DAY

[Captioner] 21:01:11
, EVERY, YOU KNOW, DAY AND 
NIGHT

[Captioner] 21:01:14
 FROM EARLY MORNING, 3 A.M. 
TO UP TO MIDNIGHT

[Captioner] 21:01:18
, I THINK 
REALLY NEED TO HAVE A

[Captioner] 21:01:21
 BETTER 
PLAN PUTTING FORWARD AND HOW WE 
CAN

[Captioner] 21:01:25
 MIGRATE THAT

[Captioner] 21:01:33
 THE VISITORS 
PARKING FROM THE STANFORD 
ENTRANCE ALONG

[Captioner] 21:01:36
 THE EAST SIDE AND 
TO HAVE A

[Captioner] 21:01:39
 BETTER PATHOLOGY AND 
FREQUENCY THAT WE CAN

[Captioner] 21:01:42
 ENFORCE 
THE VIOLATIONS.
AND I THINK

[Captioner] 21:01:46
, YOU KNOW, BECAUSE 
ONCE WE SIGN THIS 20 YEAR LEASE

[Captioner] 21:01:50
 
IT'S NO TURNING BACK.
SO WE REALLY SHOULD HAVE

[Captioner] 21:01:54
 THIS

[Captioner] 21:01:59
 A 
BALANCE IN MAKING SURE THERE'S 
ACCESS WHETHER OUR NEIGHBORHOODS

[Captioner] 21:02:03
 
OR NOT ARE GETTING ABUSE FROM 
VISITORS FROM ALL

[Captioner] 21:02:06
 OVER DIFFERENT 
COUNTIES AND, YOU KNOW, FROM ALL 
OVER THE

[Captioner] 21:02:10
 BAY AREA.
SO I THINK WOULD I LIKE TO SEE A 
LITTLE

[Captioner] 21:02:13
 BETTER PLAN, MAKING SURE 
THAT, YOU KNOW,

[Captioner] 21:02:16
 THE ONLY PARKING 
IS

[Captioner] 21:02:19
 UTILIZED, AND THAT WE CAN

[Captioner] 21:02:24
 
HAVE BETTER ENFORCEMENT FOR THE

[Captioner] 21:02:25
 
STANFORD SIDE.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 21:02:29
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.
NEXT ON OUR

[Captioner] 21:02:34
 COUNCIL.


[Captioner] 21:02:40
$IS -- OKAY.


[Captioner] 21:02:45
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN.
>> Councilmember Salwan:   THANK 
YOU,

[Captioner] 21:02:48
 MADAM MAYOR.
SO I GUESS

[Captioner] 21:02:51
, SEE I DID HAVE SOME 
CONCERNS ABOUT THE

[Captioner] 21:02:54
 SIDE LETTER.
I THINK THE INTENT IS GOOD.


[Captioner] 21:02:58
BUT IT DOESN'T REALLY SEEM 
BINDING IN ANY WAY

[Captioner] 21:03:02
 SO THAT DID 
BOTHER ME A LITTLE BIT.
SO I DON'T KNOW IF

[Captioner] 21:03:05
 THERE'S A WAY 
TO TIGHTEN IT UP AND HAVE

[Captioner] 21:03:08
 THE 
PARTY SIGN AS MORE OF A FORMAL 
UNDERSTAND

[Captioner] 21:03:11
ING THAT DURING THE 
TERM OF THIS LICE, THAT A

[Captioner] 21:03:14
 LEASE THAT A LOT

[Captioner] 21:03:18
 
WILL NOT BE BUILT.
I DON'T KNOW HOW WE DO THAT MR. 

[Captioner] 21:03:20

MR. ATTORNEY IF YOU COULD JUST 
COMMENT ON THAT.


[Captioner] 21:03:35
>> THE SIDE

[Captioner] 21:03:38
 LETTER JUST 
INDICATES INTENT.
THEY WOULD MOVE

[Captioner] 21:03:41
 FORWARD WITH 
THAT PROJECT TO MAKE IT AS A 
FORM OF THIS

[Captioner] 21:03:44
 AGREEMENT IT WOULD 
EITHER BE INCORPORATED INTO THIS 
AGREEMENT

[Captioner] 21:03:47
 OR AT A LATER TIME 
THIS AGREEMENT COULD BE 
MODIFIED, THE LEASE

[Captioner] 21:03:51
 ITSELF DOES 
HAVE LANGUAGE THAT ALLOWS

[Captioner] 21:03:55
 FOR 
FUTURE MODIFICATIONS, SO THERE 
ARE

[Captioner] 21:03:58
 WAYS PROCEDURALLY TO 
INCORPORATE ADDITIONAL TERMS 
BOTH NOW

[Captioner] 21:04:01
 OR IN THE FUTURE.
THIS DOCUMENT OF COURSE

[Captioner] 21:04:04
 REFLECTS 
COUNCIL DIRECTION UP TO THIS 
POINT.


[Captioner] 21:04:07
BUT THE SIDE LETTER IS NOT A 
FORMAL

[Captioner] 21:04:10
 AGREEMENT IN ANY SENSE.

[Captioner] 21:04:16

>> Councilmember Salwan:   OKAY, 
I WAS WONDERING IF THE PARK 


[Captioner] 21:04:19
DISTRICT WOULD BE AMENABLE TO 
MAKING THE HOURS MORE PERMANENT.

[Captioner] 21:04:22

IS THAT POSSIBLE, IS THAT 
SOMETHING WE

[Captioner] 21:04:25
 CAN ADDRESS

[Captioner] 21:04:28
?

[Captioner] 21:04:32



[Captioner] 21:04:35
>> COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN WE DON'T 
NORMALLY HAVE HOURS AS PART

[Captioner] 21:04:39
 OF 
THESE TYPE OF OPERATING 
AGREEMENTS.

[Captioner] 21:04:42

SO WE'RE WILLING TO DO WHAT WE 
HAVE INCORPORATED

[Captioner] 21:04:45
 THUS FAR INTO 
THE DISAGREEMENT.
BUT THAT'S NOT A

[Captioner] 21:04:48
 NORMAL PRACTICE 
FOR THE PARK DISTRICT.


[Captioner] 21:04:51
>> Councilmember Salwan:   SO IS 
THERE ANYTHING MORE THAN A 30 
DAY

[Captioner] 21:04:55
 WINDOW WHERE YOU CAN CHANGE 
THE HOURS OF OPERATION?

[Captioner] 21:04:58

IS THERE SOME MORE

[Captioner] 21:05:01
 ASSURANCE

[Captioner] 21:05:04
 OR 
MORE TIMING THAT YOU CAN ALLOW 
FOR THE COMMUNITY, IS THAT 


[Captioner] 21:05:07
POSSIBLE?
>> I THINK I'D HAVE TO DISCUSS 
THAT WITH OUR GENERAL

[Captioner] 21:05:10
 MANAGER.
BUT, YOU KNOW, AS I

[Captioner] 21:05:14
 HAD STATED 
EARLIER, THERE'S NO INTENTION TO 
CHANGE

[Captioner] 21:05:17
 THE HOURS THAT I'M AWARE 
OF

[Captioner] 21:05:20
.
SO I WOULD HAVE TO DISCUSS THAT.
I

[Captioner] 21:05:23
 THINK THAT WOULD BE A DELAY IN 
THE PROCESS.


[Captioner] 21:05:27
>> Councilmember Salwan:   OKAY.
AND THERE

[Captioner] 21:05:31
 WAS SOME MENTION WHEN 
INSURANCE

[Captioner] 21:05:34
 LIMIT.
I'M JUST TRYING

[Captioner] 21:05:37
 TO UNDERSTAND

[Captioner] 21:05:40
, 
IS THERE AN INSURANCE

[Captioner] 21:05:43
 FROM THE 
PARK DISTRICT OR IS THERE SOME 
SORT OF INSURANCE

[Captioner] 21:05:47
 COVERAGE IN 
THESE KIND OF DISAGREEMENTS?
>> MY UNDERSTANDING IS

[Captioner] 21:05:50
 THIS 
DRAFT NOW REFLECTS

[Captioner] 21:05:54
 CURRENT 
STANDARDS GIVEN OUTSEDATED 
NATURE

[Captioner] 21:05:57
 OF THE LAST LEASE, SO 
THIS

[Captioner] 21:06:00
 DOES REFLECT CURRENT CITY 
STANDARDS WITH RESPECT TO 
INSURANCE

[Captioner] 21:06:04
.
>> Councilmember Salwan:   OKAY.
SO IS -- I

[Captioner] 21:06:07
 HEARD SOME CONCERN 
FROM MY

[Captioner] 21:06:10
 FELLOW COLLEAGUES.
THIS IS GOING TO REQUIRE A 
MAJORITY

[Captioner] 21:06:14
 VOTE TODAY.
SO WE HAVE A 3-

[Captioner] 21:06:17
3-6.
SO MAYBE I'LL HEAR FROM MY

[Captioner] 21:06:19
 OTHER 
COLLEAGUE AND SEE WHERE WE'RE 
AT.


[Captioner] 21:06:23
>> Mayor Mei:   WELL IT SOUNDS 
LIKE YOU'RE ASKING FOR AN

[Captioner] 21:06:26
 MOU OR 
SEPARATE AGREEMENT.
THAT'S MORE BINDING

[Captioner] 21:06:31
.
>> Councilmember Salwan:   YES.

[Captioner] 21:06:34

>> Mayor Mei:   SPECIFICALLY TO 
THE TERMS OF THE HOURS AND

[Captioner] 21:06:37
 THE 
PARKING.
>> Councilmember Salwan:   THE 


[Captioner] 21:06:41
SIDE LETTER, YEAH, THE CAPITAL 
IMPROVEMENTS BUT

[Captioner] 21:06:43
 WITH THE 
PARKING.
THAT'S CORRECT.


[Captioner] 21:06:45
>> Mayor Mei:   COUNCILMEMBER 
JONES.
>> Councilmember Jones:   THANK 


[Captioner] 21:06:49
YOU MADAM MAYOR.
I JUST HAD A CLARIFYING ISSUE

[Captioner] 21:06:51
 
REGARDING THE ISSUE OF THE SIDE 
LETTER.


[Captioner] 21:06:54
WOULDN'T THE PROVISION THAT ANY 
CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS HAVE TO 
COME BEFORE

[Captioner] 21:06:57
 THE CITY COUNCIL, 
COVER, YOU KNOW, A

[Captioner] 21:07:00
 POTENTIAL 
ISSUE OF THE PARKS DISTRICT 
WANTING TO BUILD

[Captioner] 21:07:03
 A PARKING LOT 
THERE

[Captioner] 21:07:06
?

[Captioner] 21:07:10

>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado:   WELL 
GENERALLY IF A PROJECT WAS

[Captioner] 21:07:12
 
PROPOSED IT MAY REQUIRE CITY 
APPROVALS.


[Captioner] 21:07:15
WHAT THE SIDE LETTER IS 
BASICALLY SAYING FOR

[Captioner] 21:07:19
 THAT 
PARTICULAR PROJECT THE

[Captioner] 21:07:22
 CITY 
DOESN'T INTIPPED TO MOVE FORWARD 
DURING THE

[Captioner] 21:07:25
 SOMETIME OF THE LEASE 
TERM.
>> Mayor Mei:   BUT

[Captioner] 21:07:27
 IT'S NOT 
BINDING.
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado:   IT IS 


[Captioner] 21:07:31
NOT A LEGALLY BINDING DOCUMENT 
IT IS A REFLECTION OF THEIR 
INTENT

[Captioner] 21:07:34
.
IF YOU COULD READ --
>> Councilmember Jones:   JUST

[Captioner] 21:07:37
 
OUT OF CURIOSITY, WOULD 
CONSTRUCTION OR THE SUGGESTION 


[Captioner] 21:07:40
OF A CONSTRUCTION OF A 300

[Captioner] 21:07:43
 SPACE 
PARKING LOT FALL UNDER A 
CATEGORY FOR A CAPITAL 


[Captioner] 21:07:47
IMPROVEMENT FOR THE EAST BAY 
REGIONAL

[Captioner] 21:07:50
 PARKS DISTRICT?
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado:   YES.

[Captioner] 21:07:54

RR

[Captioner] 21:07:57
>> Councilmember Jones:   THAT 
WOULD COME BEFORE THE COUNCIL OR 
WOULD THAT REQUIRE

[Captioner] 21:08:01
 A PERMIT FROM 
THE CITY TO DO THAT?

[Captioner] 21:08:04

>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado:   I 
BELIEVE THAT REQUIRES A PERMIT.

[Captioner] 21:08:07

SUZANNE DO YOU HAVE AN INSIGHT?

[Captioner] 21:08:10

>> YES, BECAUSE WE WOULD NOT BE 
APPROVE

[Captioner] 21:08:14
ING AND WE WOULD DENY THAT 
REQUEST DURING THE TERM OF THIS 
LEASE

[Captioner] 21:08:17
 AGREEMENT.
>> Councilmember Jones:   SO

[Captioner] 21:08:19
 
THAT IS COVERED UNDER THE 
CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT CLAUSE OF 


[Captioner] 21:08:22
THE CONTRACT, IS THAT CORRECT?
>> THAT'S CORRECT.
IT DID

[Captioner] 21:08:26
 COME TO COUNCIL THEN 
COUNCIL WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO 
DENY IT.

[Captioner] 21:08:27

>> Councilmember Jones:   OKAY, 
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 21:08:36
>> Mayor Mei:   COUNCILMEMBER 
COX.


[Captioner] 21:08:41
>> Councilmember Cox:  

[Captioner] 21:08:50
 YOX I 
HAVE THE COMPLETE FIR WITHOUT 
HEARING HOW THE PARKING IS

[Captioner] 21:08:53
 
ADDRESSED WITH THE FREMONT 
POLICE TO UNDERSTAND

[Captioner] 21:08:56
 HOW 
EVERYONE IS GOING TO WORK 
TOGETHER ON THIS LEASE 


[Captioner] 21:08:59
DISAGREEMENT.
THAT'S ONE OF MY CONCERNS.
THE OTHER

[Captioner] 21:09:02
 ONE I'VE READ QUICKLY 
THIS LETTER, THE SIDE LETTER

[Captioner] 21:09:06
 AND 
IT JUST DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH 
LEGAL WEIGHT FOR ME TO

[Captioner] 21:09:09
 FEEL 
COMFORTABLE.

[Captioner] 21:09:12
 IN THAT

[Captioner] 21:09:15
 DOCUMENT AND 
NOT HAVING IT ATTACHED

[Captioner] 21:09:19
 AND AS A 
SIDE LETTER IT DOESN'T RESONATE

[Captioner] 21:09:22
 
AS SOMETHING THAT HAS TEETH AND 
OLOT OF STRENGTH TO IT

[Captioner] 21:09:25
.
ALSO I HAVE A CONCERN IN TERMS

[Captioner] 21:09:29
 
OF GETTING

[Captioner] 21:09:32
 FEEDBACK ON THE 
PERFORMANCE OF THE OVERALL LEASE

[Captioner] 21:09:35

LEASE, AND HOW

[Captioner] 21:09:40
 IT SHOULDN'T BE 
LEFT THAT WE END UP TERMINATING 
YES

[Captioner] 21:09:43
 THERE IS 90 DAYS TO CURE, 
AND GIVING THAT

[Captioner] 21:09:47
 NOTICE.
BUT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IF 
THERE'S WAYS TO

[Captioner] 21:09:50
 HAVE SOME SORT 
OF PERFORMANCE REVIEW

[Captioner] 21:09:54
 DONE.
SINCE THIS IS A 20-YEAR LEASE 
THAT'S A

[Captioner] 21:09:57
 LONG TIME FOR US TO GO 
WITHOUT

[Captioner] 21:10:00
 -- NOT HAVING A FORMAL 
REVIEW OF PERFORMANCE

[Captioner] 21:10:04
 EVERY 
COUPLE OF YEARS.
AND I'M NOT -- EVEN THOUGH IT

[Captioner] 21:10:07
 
MAY NOT BE STANDARD PRACTICE 
OTHER DISAGREEMENTS I HAVE SEEN 


[Captioner] 21:10:10
DO HAVE SOME SORT OF PERFORMANCE 
REVIEW AND REPORT

[Captioner] 21:10:13
 THAT'S GIVEN 
ON AN ANNUAL BASIS.
BUT ALSO WITH

[Captioner] 21:10:17
 INPUT FROM THE 
COMMUNITY ON HOW THINGS ARE 
GOING.

[Captioner] 21:10:20

AND I JUST FEEL THAT THERE'S NOT

[Captioner] 21:10:24
 
ENOUGH ALLOWING OF SOME SORT OF 
REPORTING-OUT

[Captioner] 21:10:27
.
THERE'S NOT EVEN REPORTS GIVEN 
ON HOW THEY'RE

[Captioner] 21:10:30
 MANAGING THE 
PARK.
AND THAT'S USUALLY KIND OF 


[Captioner] 21:10:33
STANDARD IN A LOT OF AGREEMENTS 
ON PERIODIC REVIEWS

[Captioner] 21:10:36
 AND REPORTS 
ON HOW THINGS ARE GOING.
WE SHOULD KNOW

[Captioner] 21:10:40
 IF THERE ARE 
CITATIONS EACH YEAR, HOW MANY, 
YOU KNOW,

[Captioner] 21:10:43
 THE STAFFING, YOU KNOW 
ALL KINDS OF THINGS TO ADDRESS 
WITH MANAGING

[Captioner] 21:10:46
 THE PARK.
AND I JUST THINK IT'S LACKING ON 
THAT PART

[Captioner] 21:10:50
.
AND I WOULD NOT AT THIS TIME

[Captioner] 21:10:53
, 
THE WAY IT'S WRITTEN I WOULDN'T 
BE ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD WITH IT

[Captioner] 21:10:57
, 
WITHOUT HAVING SOME ADDITIONS 
AND MODIFICATIONS

[Captioner] 21:11:01
.


[Captioner] 21:11:06
>> Mayor Mei:   COUNCILMEMBER 
SALWAN.
>> Councilmember Salwan:   THANK 


[Captioner] 21:11:09
YOU MADAM MAYOR.
I JUST

[Captioner] 21:11:12
 WANT TO SAY GENERALLY 
THAT I THINK IT'S IN THE 
INTEREST OF THE

[Captioner] 21:11:16
 CITY TO WORK 
WITH THE PARK

[Captioner] 21:11:19
 DISTRICT, I THINK 
AS FOLKS HAVE SAID WE WORKED

[Captioner] 21:11:23
 FOR 
MANY, MANY YEARS TOGETHER, TROWR 
YEARS IS THAT RIGHT?


[Captioner] 21:11:26
YES SO THAT'S A LONG TIME.


[Captioner] 21:11:29
-- 44 YEARS IS THAT RIGHT?
YES

[Captioner] 21:11:32
 THAT'S A LONG TIME.
I DON'T THINK THE CITY IS 
MANAGED

[Captioner] 21:11:39
 SET UP 
TO MANAGE THE PARK BY ITSELF.

[Captioner] 21:11:42

THE FIRE HAZARDS, THE LIST IS 
ENDLESS

[Captioner] 21:11:45
 
ENDLESS.
I DO FEEL WE SHOULD WORK

[Captioner] 21:11:48
 WITH 
OUR PARK DISTRICT.
BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE WE HAVE AN

[Captioner] 21:11:52
 
IMPASSE AT THIS POINT, AND SO WE 
MAY NEED TO BRING IT BACK

[Captioner] 21:11:55
 MAYBE 
AFTER DOING SOME MORE WORK.
BUT HOPEFULLY WE'VE COME

[Captioner] 21:11:59
 SO FAR.
I MEAN OF ALL THE THINGS THAT 
WE'VE

[Captioner] 21:12:02
 DONE OVER TIME WE'RE

[Captioner] 21:12:05
 AT 
THE FINAL STEPS.
SO HOPEFULLY WE CAN WORK IN GOOD 


[Captioner] 21:12:09
FAITH AND TRY TO GET THE FINAL 
PRODUCT AND GET

[Captioner] 21:12:12
 IT PASSED SOON 
SO WE CAN HAVE INSURANCES

[Captioner] 21:12:15
 ASSURANCES FOR 
BOTH

[Captioner] 21:12:18
 OUR RESIDENTS AND THE PARK 
DISTRICT.
I THINK

[Captioner] 21:12:21
 WE'RE ALMOST THERE, SOME 
MINOR TWEAKS REGARDING

[Captioner] 21:12:25
 SOME OF 
THE CONCERNS REGARDING THE SIDE 
LETTER ABOUT BEING

[Captioner] 21:12:28
 MORE 
DEFINITIVE WITH THE HOURS.
I

[Captioner] 21:12:31
 THINK THERE WERE SOME COMMENTS 
MADE BY COUNCILMEMBER COX ABOUT

[Captioner] 21:12:35
 
PERFORMANCE REVIEW.

[Captioner] 21:12:38

>> Councilmember Cox:   
PROVIDING (INAUDIBLE).


[Captioner] 21:12:41
>> Councilmember Salwan:   SOME 
SORT OF MECHANISM FOR FEEDBACK

[Captioner] 21:12:46
.
>> Councilmember Cox:   ONE OF 
THE FEEDBACKS BUT ALSO 


[Captioner] 21:12:49
DEMONSTRATED WHAT (INAUDIBLE)

[Captioner] 21:12:53
.
>> Mayor Mei:   SO IT SOUNDS 
LIKE THEN THERE'S NO

[Captioner] 21:12:55
 -- 
COUNCILMEMBER JONES DO YOU HAVE 
A COMMENT TOO?


[Captioner] 21:12:58
SORRY.
>> Councilmember Jones:   YES, 
JUST A CLARIFYING QUESTION OF 


[Captioner] 21:13:02
THE CITY ATTORNEY.
YOU MENTIONED THAT WE HAVE THE

[Captioner] 21:13:06
 
ABILITY TO AMEND THIS AGREEMENT 
AT ANY TIME, IS THAT CORRECT

[Captioner] 21:13:10
?
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado:   THE 
PE

[Captioner] 21:13:13
 
PARTIES COULD COME

[Captioner] 21:13:16
 TO ADDITIONAL 
TERMS, ADDITIONAL

[Captioner] 21:13:19
 FEATURES THAT 
ALLOWS TO ADDITIONS

[Captioner] 21:13:23
 AND 
MODIFICATIONS.
>> Councilmember Jones:   WE

[Captioner] 21:13:26
 
CAN'T AMEND IT FOR FIVE YEARS WE 
JUST HAVE TO GIVE

[Captioner] 21:13:29
 30 OR 60 DAY 
NOTICES

[Captioner] 21:13:33
.
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado:   THERE 
IS NO DISCUSSION OF AMENDMENTS

[Captioner] 21:13:35
 
OR DISAGREEMENTS.
>> Councilmember Jones:   WE 


[Captioner] 21:13:38
COULD ALWAYS COME BACK WITH THE 
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING

[Captioner] 21:13:41
 
THE PARKING PROJECT, THE CAPITAL 
IMPROVEMENTS, YOU KNOW, SOME

[Captioner] 21:13:45
 
TYPE OF REVIEW, YOU KNOW, THIS 
IS --

[Captioner] 21:13:48
 AS I MENTIONED THIS IS 
SOMETHING WE'VE BEEN IN

[Captioner] 21:13:51
 
PARTNERSHIP WITH THE EAST BAY 
REGIONAL PARKS DISTRICT FOR 44 


[Captioner] 21:13:54
YEARS.
THIS HAS BEEN A HUGE AMENITY FOR 
THE

[Captioner] 21:13:57
 ENTIRE BAY AREA AND THE 
REGION AND I WOULD HATE TO SEE

[Captioner] 21:14:01
 
IT STALL AT THIS POINT BASED ON 
A COUPLE OF LITTLE

[Captioner] 21:14:04
 TWEAKS THAT 
COULD BE MADE AT A FUTURE 
COUNCIL

[Captioner] 21:14:07
 MEETING TO AMEND THE 
AGREEMENT.
IS THAT SOMETHING THAT'S

[Captioner] 21:14:10
 EASILY 
DONE?

[Captioner] 21:14:13

>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado:   AS WE 
START TO CONSIDER WHAT POSSIBLE 


[Captioner] 21:14:16
ACTION COULD OCCUR THIS EVENING, 
ONE ALTERNATIVE IS

[Captioner] 21:14:20
 TO MOVE 
FORWARD WITH THE RECOMMENDATION, 
WITH

[Captioner] 21:14:24
 DIRECTION ON ADDITIONAL 
PROVISION

[Captioner] 21:14:27
S, YOU KNOW, FURTHER 
NEGOTIATE WITH THE DISTRICT ON

[Captioner] 21:14:30
 
ADDITIONAL TERMS.
ANOTHER ALTERNATIVE IS TO TAKE 


[Captioner] 21:14:34
NO ACTION AND SIMPLY DIRECT CITY 
STAFF TO

[Captioner] 21:14:37
 FURTHER NEGOTIATE ON 
ADDITIONAL TERMS.
SO BOTH OF THOSE

[Captioner] 21:14:40
 ARE VIABLE 
OPTIONS FOR THE COUNCIL THIS 
EVENING

[Captioner] 21:14:45
.


[Captioner] 21:14:49

>> AND LET ME CHIME IN ON THAT 
FOR JUST A MOMENT

[Captioner] 21:14:52
.
AS CITY MANAGER IF THAT

[Captioner] 21:14:55
 WERE TO 
HAPPEN, IT WOULD BE IN ALL OF 
OUR BEST INTERESTS

[Captioner] 21:14:58
 I THINK IF WE 
WERE GIVEN SPECIFIC DIRECTION ON

[Captioner] 21:15:01
 
WHAT TO GO BACK AND NEGOTIATE 
WITH THE PARK

[Captioner] 21:15:04
 DISTRICT, RATHER 
THAN A SIMPLE, YOU KNOW, GO BACK

[Captioner] 21:15:08
 
AND NEGOTIATE.
BECAUSE I THINK UP TO THIS POINT

[Captioner] 21:15:11

POINT, WIFE INCORPORATED AND 
BEEN ABLE

[Captioner] 21:15:15
 WE'VE

[Captioner] 21:15:18
 INCORPORATED AND 
BEEN ABLE TO DO

[Captioner] 21:15:21
 MOST ALL OF WHAT 
WE DID

[Captioner] 21:15:24
 DO THE LAST TIME.
THAT'S HELPFUL IN MOVING

[Captioner] 21:15:26
 THE 
NEGOTIATIONS FORWARD.
>> Councilmember Jones:   SO I 


[Captioner] 21:15:29
WOULD BE IN FAVOR OF THE CITY 
ATTORNEY'S

[Captioner] 21:15:33
 FIRST RECOMMENDATION 
AND THAT IS MOVE FORWARD WITH 
SPECIFIC DIRECTION

[Captioner] 21:15:36
 ON SOME 
TWEAKS TO IT.
WHAT I SEE AS A BIG STICK

[Captioner] 21:15:39
ING 
POINT IS THIS ISSUE OF THE 
PARKING LOT BUT MY UNDERSTANDING 


[Captioner] 21:15:42
IS THAT ISSUE IS COVERED UNDER 
THE CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT

[Captioner] 21:15:46
 CLAUSE.
SO IT REALLY COULDN'T BE 
SOMETHING THAT

[Captioner] 21:15:49
 THE EAST BAY 
REGIONAL PARKS JUST CAME IN ONE

[Captioner] 21:15:52
 
WEEKEND AND PAVED THE LOT.
IT WOULD HAVE TO COME BEFORE THE 


[Captioner] 21:15:55
COUNCIL FOR APPROVAL.
SO I

[Captioner] 21:15:59
 SEE COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN 
SHAKING HER HEAD NO

[Captioner] 21:16:03
.
>> Councilmember Kassan:   IT 
DOESN'T SAY IT HAS TO COME TO 


[Captioner] 21:16:06
COUNCIL FOR APPROVAL.
IT JUST SAYS IT REQUIRES

[Captioner] 21:16:08
 CITY 
APPROVAL.
>> Mayor Mei:   WHAT I'M HEARING 


[Captioner] 21:16:12
RIGHT NOW IT SEEMS LIKE PEOPLE 
WOULD LIKE TO PREFER TO TABLE 
THIS

[Captioner] 21:16:15
 UNTIL IT'S MORE FIRM 
SPECIFICALLY FOR PARKING

[Captioner] 21:16:20
.
AND THAT

[Captioner] 21:16:23
 A SIDE LETTER IS NOT I 
GUESS SUFFICIENT

[Captioner] 21:16:26
 AND I LEGALLY

[Captioner] 21:16:29
 
BINDING.
SO IT SOUNDS LIKE

[Captioner] 21:16:32
 FROM THE 
COUNCIL

[Captioner] 21:16:36
 ONE IS PARKING AND THE 
OTHER IS THE HOURS, I KNOW THAT 
IT IS

[Captioner] 21:16:39
 NOT STANDARD TO HAVE HOURS 
IN THE TERMS

[Captioner] 21:16:43
, BUT FROM THE 
PERSPECTIVE, WHAT I'M HEARING

[Captioner] 21:16:46
 
FROM EAST BAY REGIONAL

[Captioner] 21:16:49
 PARKS 
REPRESENTATION IS IF WE WERE 
ABLE TO GET IT ON

[Captioner] 21:16:52
 EVEN AN ANNUAL 
BASIS, I THINK PEOPLE

[Captioner] 21:16:55
 WOULD FIND 
THAT MUCH MORE PALATABLE

[Captioner] 21:16:58
 THAN TO 
HAVE IT SO VARIABLE AS A 
PERSPECTIVE.


[Captioner] 21:17:01
SO THOSE ARE TWO OF THE THINGS I 
HEARD.
AS FAR AS USAGE

[Captioner] 21:17:05
, I DON'T KNOW 
HOW THAT PERTAINS TO THE PARKS 
AS A WHOLE.

[Captioner] 21:17:08

IT'S NOT JUST FOR EAST BAY 
REGIONAL PARKS BUT I

[Captioner] 21:17:11
 GUESSITE BE 
CURIOUS TO FIND OUT, TO

[Captioner] 21:17:15
 HAVE 
YFTION REPORTS OTHER THINGS SO I 
DON'T KNOW

[Captioner] 21:17:18
 IF EAST BAY REGIONAL 
PARKS HAS

[Captioner] 21:17:21
 ANYTHING COMMENT WISE 
ON OPERATIONS.
BUT TYPICALLY WE DON'T

[Captioner] 21:17:24
 HAVE AN 
EVALUATION BUT I THINK THAT THE 
PUBLIC COMMUNICATION ASPECT AND

[Captioner] 21:17:27
 
I KNOW I APPRECIATE 
COUNCILMEMBER JONES REPRESENTING

[Captioner] 21:17:31
 
US ON THAT AND THE

[Captioner] 21:17:34
 PAST 
COUNCILMEMBER DID BUT IT'S 
IMPORTANT FOR US TO BE ABLE

[Captioner] 21:17:37
 TO 
ASSURE THAT THE PUBLIC DOES 
ATTEND

[Captioner] 21:17:40
 THOSE.
COUNCILMEMBER COX DID YOU HAVE

[Captioner] 21:17:43
 
SOMETHING ELSE TO ADD TO THAT OR 
IS THAT

[Captioner] 21:17:46
 JUST -- I'M SORRY.


[Captioner] 21:17:50
YOU'RE MUTED I'M SORRY.
THANK YOU.
>> Councilmember Cox:   I WAS 


[Captioner] 21:17:53
ASKING IN TERMS OF HAVING SOME 
SORT OF REPORT

[Captioner] 21:17:57
ING OF HOW THINGS 
ARE GOING

[Captioner] 21:18:00
 ON A YEARLY BASIS TO

[Captioner] 21:18:03
 
LET US KNOW, YOU KNOW, HOW MANY 
CITATIONS

[Captioner] 21:18:07
, HOW MANY, YOU KNOW, 
WERE POLICE OFFICERS,

[Captioner] 21:18:10
 THAT WERE

[Captioner] 21:18:14
 
ADMINISTERING, UNUSUAL

[Captioner] 21:18:18
 
REPORTING, THOSE THOSE ARE

[Captioner] 21:18:20
 JUST 
STANDARD REPORTS THAT ARE 
REQUIRED.


[Captioner] 21:18:23
ESPECIALLY USING PUBLIC FUNDS 
THAT WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO

[Captioner] 21:18:26
 GET.
AS THERE'S THINGS THAT ARE

[Captioner] 21:18:29
 
LOGGED IN EVERY DAY FOR A PARK 
RANGER OR

[Captioner] 21:18:33
 OFFICER ON THINGS THAT 
OCCUR AT A PARK.
SO I'M JUST

[Captioner] 21:18:37
 THINKING, AND 
THERE'S A LOT OF CONCERN

[Captioner] 21:18:40
 THAT, 
YOU KNOW, HOW ALSO WILL

[Captioner] 21:18:44
 THE 
CONSTITUENTS, OUR

[Captioner] 21:18:47
 FREMONT 
TAXPAYERS BE ABLE TO HAVE SOME 
SORT OF INPUT.

[Captioner] 21:18:50

YOU GET A REPORT BUT IS THERE 
WAYS TO MAKE IT BETTER, IMPROVE

[Captioner] 21:18:53
 
IT, MAYBE THAT COMES TO THE 
LIAISON

[Captioner] 21:18:56
 BUT THERE SHOULD BE SOME 
DOCUMENTATION AND SOMEONE ELSE 
IS

[Captioner] 21:18:59
 MANAGING AND OPERATING OUR 
PARK, THAT WE SHOULD BE HAVING 
SOME

[Captioner] 21:19:03
 SORT OF UPDATES OF AT

[Captioner] 21:19:07
 LEAST 
A SEMI ANNUAL OR ANNUAL REPORT 
THAT WE

[Captioner] 21:19:10
 CAN REFER BACK TO.
HOW ARE THINGS

[Captioner] 21:19:13
 WORKING?
20 YEARS IS A LONG TIME TO

[Captioner] 21:19:17
 HAVE 
ONE PARTICULAR ORGANIZATION 
WHICH WE'RE

[Captioner] 21:19:20
 VERY FORTUNATE TO 
HAVE THE PARTNERSHIP WITH THE 
PARKS

[Captioner] 21:19:24
 WITH THE CITY OF FREMONT, 
BUT WE ALSO SHOULD LOOK

[Captioner] 21:19:27
 AT HOW 
WE CAN HAVE FEEDBACK AND 
INFORMATION ABOUT HOW THINGS

[Captioner] 21:19:30
 ARE 
GOING AND NOT JUST CLOSE THE 
BOOKS AND NOT

[Captioner] 21:19:33
 KNOW ANYTHING AND 
FINDING OUT, YOU KNOW, WE 
JUST --

[Captioner] 21:19:36
 20 YEARS IS A LONG TIME

[Captioner] 21:19:40
.
>> Mayor Mei:   I DO WANT TO 
CLARIFY

[Captioner] 21:19:43
 THAT IN -- BY NOW WE'RE 
CURRENTLY, MY UNDERSTANDING

[Captioner] 21:19:46
 IS 
WE'RE ON A MONTH TO MONTH LEASE.
AND IF WE WERE

[Captioner] 21:19:50
 NOT TO BE ABLE 
TO, I DON'T THINK THE CITY HAS 
THE

[Captioner] 21:19:52
 ABILITY TO RUN THAT PARK AND 
HAVE

[Captioner] 21:19:56
 THE PERSONNEL OR STAFFING

[Captioner] 21:20:00
.
>> THAT'S RIGHT, WE'RE NOT 
PREPARED TO

[Captioner] 21:20:03
.
>> Mayor Mei:   AND THE OTHER 
OPTION IS SHUTTERING WHICH IS 


[Captioner] 21:20:06
NOT GOING TO BE A POPULAR OPTION 
EITHER.
SOMEWHERE BETWEEN

[Captioner] 21:20:10
 THE BALANCE OF 
THE TWO.
>> WE HAVE A MAINTENANCE

[Captioner] 21:20:13
 
OBLIGATION WHICH WE ARE ALSO NOT 
BUDGETED FOR AT THIS TIME.

[Captioner] 21:20:16

>> Mayor Mei:   I JUST WANTED TO 
CLARIFY THAT.

[Captioner] 21:20:18

COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN.
>> Councilmember Kassan:   THANK 


[Captioner] 21:20:21
YOU.
YES, LOOKING BACK AT THE LAST 
TIME

[Captioner] 21:20:25
 WE TALKED ABOUT THE LEASE, 
I KNOW THERE WAS A HUGE ISSUE

[Captioner] 21:20:28
 
RELATED TO THE MISCOMMUNICATION 
ABOUT WHETHER IT

[Captioner] 21:20:31
 WAS ACCEPTABLE 
FOR THE CITY TO CLOSE THE

[Captioner] 21:20:34
 STREET 
IN AN EMERGENCY SITUATION.
AND WE

[Captioner] 21:20:37
 DIDN'T EVEN TALK ABOUT 
THIS, THAT THIS TIME AND

[Captioner] 21:20:41
 I 
REALLY WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE STAFF 
AND THANK YOU ON BOTH

[Captioner] 21:20:44
 SIDES, FOR 
ADDRESSING THAT ISSUE IN THE 
LEASE.

[Captioner] 21:20:47

THAT IS HUGE AND WE DIDN'T EVEN 
TALK ABOUT IT

[Captioner] 21:20:51
 BECAUSE IT WAS 
ADDRESSED.
SO LET'S

[Captioner] 21:20:54
 NOT FORGET THAT WAS A 
HUGE

[Captioner] 21:20:57
 ACCOMPLISHMENT.
BUT LAST TIME WE TALKED ABOUT 
THE LEASE THAT WAS NOT

[Captioner] 21:21:00
 THE ONLY 
ISSUE THAT WAS BROUGHT..
ALL THE SAME ISSUES

[Captioner] 21:21:03
 THAT WE'RE 
TALKING ABOUT NOW IN TERMS OF 
HOURS, IN TERMS

[Captioner] 21:21:06
 OF, YOU KNOW, 
WAYS TO ADDRESS VIOLATIONS,

[Captioner] 21:21:09
 IN 
TERMS OF ENSURING THAT THERE

[Captioner] 21:21:12
 
WOULD BE NO AMENITIES BUILT AT 
THIS LOCATION.


[Captioner] 21:21:15
THESE ARE ALL THINGS THAT CAME 
UP LAST TIME.
SO

[Captioner] 21:21:19
 I DON'T THINK THERE WAS ANY 
LACK OF COMMUNICATION FROM THE 
COUNCIL

[Captioner] 21:21:22
 ABOUT ALL OF THESE 
ISSUES LAST TIME.
I KNOW THAT THE

[Captioner] 21:21:25
 ISSUE WE FOCUSED 
THE MOST ON WAS THAT ISSUE OF

[Captioner] 21:21:28
 
OUR ABILITY TO CLOSE THE STREET.
BUT I THINK IF YOU LOOK

[Captioner] 21:21:32
 BACK AT 
WHAT WAS DISCUSSED LAST TIME

[Captioner] 21:21:35
, 
WE'VE REJECTED THE LEASE, I 
THINK

[Captioner] 21:21:38
 YOU'LL FIND THAT THERE WAS 
DIRECTION ON SOME OF THESE

[Captioner] 21:21:41
 OTHER 
ITEMS AS WELL.
THANK YOU

[Captioner] 21:21:44
.

[Captioner] 21:21:54

>> Mayor Mei:   CITY MANAGER, 
CITY ATTORNEY, I WAS JUST SEEING

[Captioner] 21:21:57
 
IF THAT WAS ENOUGH DIRECTION.
ALSO THANK YOU TO OUR

[Captioner] 21:22:01
 STAFF AND 
EAST BAY REGIONAL PARK FOR 
JOINING

[Captioner] 21:22:04
 US TODAY ON THIS.

[Captioner] 21:22:09

>> WELL, I MEAN ASSUMING THERE'S 
AN AGREEMENT,

[Captioner] 21:22:13
 MAJORITY AGREEMENT 
ON THESE ITEMS THAT YOU'VE 
LISTED THEN

[Captioner] 21:22:16
 YOU KNOW YEAH, THAT 
IS -- THAT WOULD BE

[Captioner] 21:22:20
 SUFFICIENT, 
SUFFICIENT INFORMATION FOR 
STAFF.


[Captioner] 21:22:23
AND I JUST WANTED TO

[Captioner] 21:22:28
 -- I JUST 
WANT FOR ALL OF US TO KEEP IN 
MIND THAT

[Captioner] 21:22:31
 A NEGOTIATION IS JUST 
THAT.
YOU KNOW BOTH PARTIES HAVE

[Captioner] 21:22:34
 TO 
AGREE TO THESE THINGS.
I THINK IT WAS

[Captioner] 21:22:37
 A BIG STEP 
FORWARD ALSO TO HAVE THE HOURS

[Captioner] 21:22:40
 
ACKNOWLEDGED IN THE CURRENT 
LEASE AGREEMENT AS WELL.


[Captioner] 21:22:43
SO WHILE WE'LL GO BACK AND HAVE 
THESE DISCUSSIONS,

[Captioner] 21:22:46
 THAT'S JUST 
WHAT IT IS.
IT IS A DISCUSSION AND A 


[Captioner] 21:22:49
NEGOTIATION.
AND WE'LL COME BACK WITH OUR

[Captioner] 21:22:52
, 
YOU KNOW, BEST WORK.
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado:   I 


[Captioner] 21:22:56
THINK IT WOULD BE HELPFUL IF I 
MAY

[Captioner] 21:23:00
 CITY MANAGER SHACKELFORD, TO 
UNDERSTAND IN DETAIL WHAT CITY

[Captioner] 21:23:02
 
STAFF IS BEING ASKED TO PROFFER, 
IN OUR

[Captioner] 21:23:06
 NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE 
DISTRIBUTE ON THOSE THREE 
ISSUES.

[Captioner] 21:23:09

SO IF WE'D HAVE A MINUTE HERE, 
I'D

[Captioner] 21:23:12
 LIKE TO CLARIFY, FOR 
EXAMPLE, ON

[Captioner] 21:23:15
 THE ISSUE OF HOURS 
OF OPERATION, WHAT I HEARD FROM 
COUNCILMEMBER

[Captioner] 21:23:18
 SALWAN IS, A 
CONCERN ABOUT THE 30

[Captioner] 21:23:21
 DAY PERIOD, 
AND A DESIRE TO MAYBE EXTEND 
THAT

[Captioner] 21:23:25
 PERIOD OF TIME OF 30 DAYS 
TO 60 DAYS NOTICE.
SO

[Captioner] 21:23:28
 I WANTED TO CLARIFY WHETHER 
THAT WAS -- WHETHER THAT

[Captioner] 21:23:31
 WAS THE 
DIRECTION OF THE COUNCIL ON THAT 
ISSUE.

[Captioner] 21:23:32

>> Councilmember Salwan:   OR 
LONGER.


[Captioner] 21:23:35
I MEAN WE'D LOVE TO GET A YEAR

[Captioner] 21:23:39
.
TO GET SOME

[Captioner] 21:23:43
 PREDICTABILITY.


[Captioner] 21:23:53
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado:   THE 
TIME FRAME IS REALLY UP

[Captioner] 21:23:56
 TO THE 
COUNCIL TO DIRECT US --
>> Councilmember Salwan:   ONE 


[Captioner] 21:23:59
YEAR.
>> Mayor Mei:   AND WHEN I HEAR 
ONE

[Captioner] 21:24:03
 YEAR UNDERSTANDING WHAT THE 
TIME FRAME IS,

[Captioner] 21:24:06
 BUT I'M NOT 
ACKNOWLEDGING THAT DAYLIGHT 
SAVINGS

[Captioner] 21:24:09
 TIME AT LEAST FOR NOW 
THERE MAY BE SOME

[Captioner] 21:24:13
 CHANGES.
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado:   
ASSUMING THE COUNCIL MAJORITY 


[Captioner] 21:24:16
DIRECTS US THAT IT WOULD BE A 
CHANGE FROM 30 DAYS NOTICE IN 
WRITING

[Captioner] 21:24:19
 OF POTENTIAL CHANGES TO 
THE HOURS, TO A PERIOD OF A

[Captioner] 21:24:22
 
YEAR.
>> Mayor Mei:   ANNUAL.

[Captioner] 21:24:24

>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado:   SO 
BEFORE NEW HOURS WOULD BE 


[Captioner] 21:24:27
IMPLEMENTED THE DISTRICT WOULD 
BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE US ONE

[Captioner] 21:24:30
 
YEAR'S NOTICE.
>> Councilmember Cox:   THAT'S 


[Captioner] 21:24:33
NOT REASONABLE.
>> Councilmember Salwan:   
REASONABLE

[Captioner] 21:24:37
?
>> Mayor Mei:   YOUR MIC IS OFF 
SORRY.


[Captioner] 21:24:40
>> Councilmember Cox:   THAT'S 
NOT REALLY REASONABLE TO ASK A 
YEAR IN ADVANCE.

[Captioner] 21:24:43

I THINK THAT, YOU KNOW, WITHIN 
60 DAYS, I

[Captioner] 21:24:46
 THINK WOULD BE 
REASONABLE.


[Captioner] 21:24:51
FOR HOURS OF CHANGE.


[Captioner] 21:24:56
I'M JUST LOOKING IN TERMS OF --

[Captioner] 21:25:00

>> Councilmember Salwan:   I'LL 
MEET YOU HALFWAY, SIX MONTHS,

[Captioner] 21:25:03
 
HOW IS THAT?
WE'RE NEGOTIATING

[Captioner] 21:25:06
 AMONG 
OURSELVES.
>> Councilmember Cox:  

[Captioner] 21:25:10
 THAT IS 
PRETTY DRASTIC.
LOOK HOW --

[Captioner] 21:25:12

>> Councilmember Salwan:   THE 
HOURS NOW ARE WORKING.


[Captioner] 21:25:15
ALL THE PARTIES SAY THE HOURS 
ARE FINE

[Captioner] 21:25:18
.
>> Councilmember Cox:   QUOTE 
THE HOURS, WHAT ARE THE HOURS 


[Captioner] 21:25:21
NOW?
>> Councilmember Salwan:   I 
THINK IT WAS 6:30 A.M.

[Captioner] 21:25:24
 TO 9 P.M.

[Captioner] 21:25:27

>> Councilmember Cox:   THAT'S 
WHAT I HAD.


[Captioner] 21:25:30
>> Councilmember Salwan:   OKAY 
AND BY ALL ACCOUNTS IT'S 
WORKING, SO

[Captioner] 21:25:34
 THE IT'S WORKING WHY 
CHANGE THE HOURS?
WHY DO WE

[Captioner] 21:25:37
 NEED TO MAKE A DRASTIC 
CHANGE IN A MONTH,

[Captioner] 21:25:40
 YOU KNOW.
>> Councilmember Cox:   6:

[Captioner] 21:25:43
30 TO 
9 WAS APRIL TO DECEMBER AND 
DECEMBER 23rd

[Captioner] 21:25:46
 THROUGH MARCH 
THRURNT WAS 6

[Captioner] 21:25:50
 TO 8:30.
>> THAT'S

[Captioner] 21:25:53
 LIKE A SIX MONTH 
CHANGE.

[Captioner] 21:25:57

>> Mayor Mei:   IF THEY COULD 
SOLIDIFY VERSUS

[Captioner] 21:26:00
 RIGHT NOW IT 
COULD CHANGE IN 30 DAYS.
RMPLETD SO RIGHT

[Captioner] 21:26:03
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado:   SO 
RIGHT NOW THE DRAFT

[Captioner] 21:26:07
 LEASE 
AGREEMENT PROVIDES WHAT THE 
CURRENT HOURS

[Captioner] 21:26:11
 OF THE STANFORD 
STAGING HOURS ARE,

[Captioner] 21:26:14
 AS SET 
FORWARD BY THE MAYOR AND IT 
REQUIRES A 30 DAY NOTICE TO THE

[Captioner] 21:26:17
 
CITY IF THOSE HOURS ARE GOING TO 
BE CHANGED, 30

[Captioner] 21:26:20
 DAY NOTICE UNDER 
THIS PROPOSED TERM.
SO RIGHT NOW IT REALLY

[Captioner] 21:26:24
 IS UP TO 
THE COUNCIL TO GIVE US DIRECTION 
IN TERMS OF WHAT

[Captioner] 21:26:27
 -- HOW MUCH 
NOTICE THE COUNCIL WOULD DESIRE 
BEFORE THOSE HOURS

[Captioner] 21:26:30
 WOULD CHANGE 
UNDER THE PROPOSED LEASE.


[Captioner] 21:26:33
>> Councilmember Cox:   I'M 
WILLING TO DO SIX MONTHS BECAUSE 
WE GOT TWO DIFFERENT

[Captioner] 21:26:37
 TIME 
CHANGES.
IT WOULD BE HALF THE YEAR,

[Captioner] 21:26:40
 THE 
OTHER HALF.

[Captioner] 21:26:44

>> Councilmember Salwan:   AND 
WE CAN REMOVE THE CLAUSE ABOUT

[Captioner] 21:26:48
 
CHANGES ALTOGETHER YOU KNOW.
>> Councilmember Cox:   MAKE IT 


[Captioner] 21:26:51
PERMANENT YOU MEAN?
>> Councilmember Salwan:   LIKE 
NUMBER 10.

[Captioner] 21:26:54

>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado:   IN 
OTHER WORDS, LIKE ANOTHER OPTION 


[Captioner] 21:26:57
THAT COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN IS 
CONSIDERING IS TO JUST REMOVE 
THE LANGUAGE

[Captioner] 21:27:01
 ESSENTIALLY LEAVING 
THOSE HOURS AS PERMANENT HOURS.
>> Councilmember Salwan: 

[Captioner] 21:27:04
  YES.
>> Councilmember Cox:   THAT 
WOULD BE GOOD

[Captioner] 21:27:07
 TO STABILIZE.


[Captioner] 21:27:14
BUT I DON'T KNOW IF EVERYBODY 
ELSE WOULD AGREE.

[Captioner] 21:27:17

>> Mayor Mei:   I'M NOT HEARING 
THE COUNCIL MAJORITY ON THAT.


[Captioner] 21:27:25
ARE OTHER COUNCILMEMBERS 
INTERESTED IN COMMENTING ON THE

[Captioner] 21:27:28
 
HOURS?


[Captioner] 21:27:33
SEEING NONE, BUT WE WOULD NEED 
TO GIVE DIRECTIONS

[Captioner] 21:27:36
.
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN

[Captioner] 21:27:39
.
>> Councilmember Kassan:   YES, 
I JUST WANT TO SUGGEST, THERE'S 


[Captioner] 21:27:43
A LOT OF DIFFERENT ISSUES IN THE 
LEASE THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED.

[Captioner] 21:27:45

I THINK TONIGHT WE PROBABLY 
DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO GO 


[Captioner] 21:27:48
THROUGH ALL OF THEM AND TRY TO 
GET CONSENSUS ON THEM

[Captioner] 21:27:52
.
THE HOURS IS JUST ONE.
SO

[Captioner] 21:27:55
 IT COULD BE A GOOD IDEA TO DO 
A WORKING GROUP, A WORKING

[Captioner] 21:27:59
 
MEETING TO SPECIFICALLY GO 
THROUGH ALL THE ITEMS AND 


[Captioner] 21:28:02
DISCUSS EACH ONE.
I MEAN WE COULD --

[Captioner] 21:28:05
 THERE'S 
PROBABLY AT LEAST TEN ITEMS IN 
THE LEASE THAT WE MIGHT WANT TO

[Captioner] 21:28:08

TO -- BUT I KNOW WE WANT TO 
DISCUSS IN TERMS OF

[Captioner] 21:28:12
 THINGS I 
WOULD LIKE TO SEE CHANGED.


[Captioner] 21:28:19
>> Vice Mayor Keng:   I CAN 
SUPPORT THAT.
>> Mayor Mei: 

[Captioner] 21:28:22
  COUNCILMEMBER 
KENG YOU WANT A SEPARATE WORKING 
GROUP.


[Captioner] 21:28:25
IN THIS INTERIM I GUESS WHAT 
WOULD HAPPEN IN THIS

[Captioner] 21:28:28
 SITUATION?
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado:   IF 
ONE ALTERNATIVE IS IF THE

[Captioner] 21:28:32
 
COUNCIL WERE TO DESIRE TO CREATE 
AN AD HOC COMMITTEE

[Captioner] 21:28:34
 IT WOULD 
NEED TO BE LESS THAN FOUR 
MEMBERS.


[Captioner] 21:28:37
SO YOU DON'T HAVE A MAJORITY.
AND THOSE MEMBERS COULD THEN

[Captioner] 21:28:41
 
MEET WITH CITY STAFF TO DEVELOP 
FURTHER RECOMMENDATIONS

[Captioner] 21:28:44
 TO THE 
CITY COUNCIL ABOUT THOSE 
SPECIFIC ISSUES.


[Captioner] 21:28:47
SO IN OTHER WORDS, THE 
SUBCOMMITTEE WOULD MEET

[Captioner] 21:28:50
 WITH 
CITY MANAGER'S OFFICE AND 
DESIGNATED STAFF,

[Captioner] 21:28:54
 TO DISCUSS 
THESE SPECIFICALLY PARAMETERS 
AND THEN

[Captioner] 21:28:57
 COME BACK TO THE FULL 
COUNCIL WITH THE RECOMMENDATION 
TO TRY TO

[Captioner] 21:29:00
 OBTAIN MAJORITY 
APPROVAL, AND

[Captioner] 21:29:03
 THEN CONTINUE 
NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE DISTRICT 
AFTER THAT POINT

[Captioner] 21:29:06
.
>> Mayor Mei:   OKAY.

[Captioner] 21:29:11

>> AND JUST FOR CLARITY FOR 
MYSELF, WERE YOU ASKING FOR LIKE 


[Captioner] 21:29:14
A STUDY SESSION ABOUT THE ITEM?
A WORKING MEETING?

[Captioner] 21:29:17

A SPECIAL MEETING?
FOCUSING ON JUST THIS TOPIC

[Captioner] 21:29:20
?
OR WERE YOU SUGGESTING

[Captioner] 21:29:24
 A COUNCIL 
SUBCOMMITTEE

[Captioner] 21:29:27
?

[Captioner] 21:29:30

>> Councilmember Kassan:   I 
THINK EITHER ONE COULD BE 


[Captioner] 21:29:33
HELPFUL WHATEVER STAFF THINKS IS 
BEST OR THE MAJORITY OF THE 
COUNCIL THINKS IS

[Captioner] 21:29:36
 BEST.
>> Mayor Mei:   I WOULD LIKE

[Captioner] 21:29:40
 TO 
RECOGNIZE JIM

[Captioner] 21:29:44
 O'CONNOR.

[Captioner] 21:29:47

>> HE HAD HAD HIS HAND RAISED.

[Captioner] 21:29:50

>> THANK YOU, MADAM MAYOR.
JUST ONE THING FOR THE COUNCIL 


[Captioner] 21:29:53
TO CONSIDER.
THE ABILITY TO CHANGE HOURS IS 
OFTEN RELATED TO

[Captioner] 21:29:56
 OUR ABILITY TO 
BE FLEXIBLE AND ADDRESS

[Captioner] 21:29:59
 ISSUES.
WHEN WE ORIGINALLY CHANGED THE 
HOURS IN

[Captioner] 21:30:03
 2014 I WAS TRYING TO 
ATTEMPT TO ADDRESS THE AFTER

[Captioner] 21:30:06

AFTER-HOURS USAGE.
SO JUST I WANTED TO

[Captioner] 21:30:09
 KEEP IN MIND 
THAT ABILITY FOR US TO CHANGE 
HOURS IS

[Captioner] 21:30:12
 OFTEN A RESULT OF 
TRYING TO

[Captioner] 21:30:15
 ADJUST AND MAKE 
OPERATIONAL CHANGES.
SO JUST

[Captioner] 21:30:18
 -- THAT'S JUST SOMETHING 
TO KEEP IN MIND AS YOU'RE 
THINKING

[Captioner] 21:30:21
 ABOUT THAT COMMENT.

[Captioner] 21:30:24

RMPLED AND ACTUALLY THAT REMINDS 
ME, THE POINT I WANT

[Captioner] 21:30:28
ED TO MAKE 
ABOUT THAT SECTION IN THAT 
NOTICE IS

[Captioner] 21:30:31
 IT ACTUALLY TRIGGERS A 
NOTICE REQUIREMENT TO THE CITY 
AND THEN THE CITY

[Captioner] 21:30:34
 IS SUPPOSED TO 
MEET WITH DISTRICT STAFF TO 
DISCUSS THE PROPOSED

[Captioner] 21:30:37
 CHANGES.
SO IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY SOLIDIFY

[Captioner] 21:30:40
 
THOSE HOURS PERMANENTLY THAT 
WOULD REQUIRE ADDITIONAL CHANGES

[Captioner] 21:30:45

CHANGES.

[Captioner] 21:30:50

>> Mayor Mei: 

[Captioner] 21:30:53
COUNCILMEMBER 
SALWAN.
>> Councilmember Salwan:   I'M 


[Captioner] 21:30:57
SORRY SAY THAT AGAIN MR. CITY 
ATTORNEY

[Captioner] 21:31:00
.
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado:   THE 
FULL CEX OF THAT

[Captioner] 21:31:03
 NOTICE AS IT'S 
WRITTEN, DISTRICT

[Captioner] 21:31:06
 IS REQUIRED TO 
PROVIDE THE CITY 30 DAYS NOTICE

[Captioner] 21:31:09
 
BEFORE TRIGGERING THOSE HOURS 
AND WHAT THAT

[Captioner] 21:31:13
 SAYS IS THE CITY 
GETS THE NOTICE AND CAN

[Captioner] 21:31:17
 CHOOSE 
COMMUNITY MEETINGS BY THE

[Captioner] 21:31:20
 
MANAGER AND DISTRICT MANAGER AND 
IN ADDITION TO THE

[Captioner] 21:31:23
 COMMUNITY 
MEETINGS REGARDING THE PROPOSED 
CHANGES THE DISTRICT WILL

[Captioner] 21:31:26
 
INCLUDE CHANGES OF HOURS 
REGULARLY SCHEDULED MEETINGS

[Captioner] 21:31:28
 OF 
THE DISTRICT THEY'LL ADDRESS 
THAT.


[Captioner] 21:31:31
SO WHAT IT DOES IS ACTUALLY 
TRIGGERS THESE

[Captioner] 21:31:34
 ADDITIONAL 
REQUIREMENTS.
IT DOESN'T TRIGGER THE CHANGE OF 


[Captioner] 21:31:37
THE HOURS THEMSELVES.
>> Councilmember Salwan:   YES 
BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE THE

[Captioner] 21:31:41
 PARK 
DISTRICT UNILATERALLY CAN CHANGE 
THEM AS LONG AS THEY

[Captioner] 21:31:44
 DO THESE 
MEETINGS.
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado:   IT 


[Captioner] 21:31:47
LOUSE THE DISTRICT TO MAKE THE 
CHANGES SO LONG AS THEY NOTIFY 
THE

[Captioner] 21:31:50
 CITY ACCORDING TO THIS 
PROVISION YES

[Captioner] 21:31:54
.
>> BUT FOR OBJECTION WE SHOULD 
BE ABLE

[Captioner] 21:31:57
 TO OBJECT.
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado:   I 
DIDN'T

[Captioner] 21:32:00
 CATCH THAT.
>> Councilmember Salwan:   
MEANING THEY CAN BASICALLY GO 


[Captioner] 21:32:04
THROUGH THE FORMALITIES OF DOING 
THESE MEETINGS BUT THEY

[Captioner] 21:32:07
 CAN 
STILL INSTITUTE THE HOURS THAT 
THE PARK DISTRICT

[Captioner] 21:32:10
 WANTS.
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado:   IT 
ESSENTIALLY PROVIDES THE

[Captioner] 21:32:14
 CITY A 
VOICE IN THAT COMMUNITY MEETING 
PROCESS AND PRESUMABLY

[Captioner] 21:32:17
 THEY 
WOULD TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE 
CITY'S

[Captioner] 21:32:20
 CONCERNS AND PUBLIC 
CONCERNS AS PART OF THAT 
PROCESS.

[Captioner] 21:32:24

>> Councilmember Salwan:   
RIGHT.

[Captioner] 21:32:26

SO OKAY A COUPLE OF THINGS HAVE 
COME UP.


[Captioner] 21:32:29
ONE IS THE SUBCOMMITTEE.
SO MY CONCERN IS LIKE AT THE END 
OF THE DAY

[Captioner] 21:32:32
, WE WANT A LEASE 
THAT'S DONE.
AND SO IF WE HAVE

[Captioner] 21:32:36
 MORE MEETINGS, 
MORE COMMITTEE MEETINGS, I

[Captioner] 21:32:39
 MEAN 
IF THE THREE OF US DECIDE 
SOMETHING

[Captioner] 21:32:42
 WILL THE OTHER FOUR 
SIGN ON?
THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO HEAR.

[Captioner] 21:32:44

BECAUSE IT HAS TO START WITH 
GOOD FAITH.


[Captioner] 21:32:47
WE DON'T WANT TO GO WHERE

[Captioner] 21:32:51
 THIS 
EXERCISE AND AT THE

[Captioner] 21:32:54
 LAST HOUR 
I'M NOT VOTING FOR

[Captioner] 21:32:57
 THIS.
>> Councilmember Jones:   JUST 
REAL

[Captioner] 21:33:01
 QUICKLY FOR THE CITY 
MANAGER,

[Captioner] 21:33:05
 WOULD THAT BE A MORE 
EFFICIENT MANNER OF TAKING CARE 
OF THIS

[Captioner] 21:33:08
 RATHER THAN DOING A 
SUBCOMMITTEE THAT MAY DIVIDE 
SOME

[Captioner] 21:33:11
 MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL?

[Captioner] 21:33:17

SHSTLED

[Captioner] 21:33:25
>> BASED ON HOW THE MEETING HAS 
GONE TODAY, I WOULD SAY

[Captioner] 21:33:29
 A WORK 
SESSION BASED ON WHAT EACH

[Captioner] 21:33:32
 OF 
THE ITEMS ON THE AGREEMENT WOULD 
BE MOST HELPFUL MORE

[Captioner] 21:33:35
 SO THAN, 
YOU KNOW, A SUBCOMMITTEE FOR, 
YOU KNOW, SOME

[Captioner] 21:33:38
 OF THE REASONS 
THAT COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN JUST 
MENTIONED

[Captioner] 21:33:42
.
>> Councilmember Jones:   RIGHT 
AND THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR INPUT 


[Captioner] 21:33:45
FROM THE ENTIRE COUNCIL.
>> ABSOLUTELY.


[Captioner] 21:33:49
>> Councilmember Jones:   GREAT 
THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei:   I THINK WHAT 


[Captioner] 21:33:54
WE'RE HEARING RIGHT NOW IS TO 
TABLE AND SCHEDULE A WORK 
SESSION.

[Captioner] 21:33:57

AND I THINK THAT'S UNANIMOUS.


[Captioner] 21:34:03
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado:   NO, I 
THINK THAT'S SUFFICIENT 
DIRECTION FOR CITY STAFF

[Captioner] 21:34:07
 THAT WE 
WOULD FIND A TIME THAT WOULD 
WORK TO

[Captioner] 21:34:10
 HAVE A SPECIAL MEETING 
THAT WOULD BE IN THE FORM OF A 
WORK

[Captioner] 21:34:13
 SESSION REGARDING THE 
SPECIFIC TOPIC.
>> Mayor Mei:   I JUST WANTED

[Captioner] 21:34:16
 TO 
KNOW FOR THE PUBLIC FOR OTHERS 
WE HAVE RECEIVED THE

[Captioner] 21:34:20
 COMMENTS AS 
WELL AS THE FEEDBACK

[Captioner] 21:34:23
 FROM 
E-MAILS AND OTHER THINGS.
SO JUST LET YOU KNOW WE HAVE

[Captioner] 21:34:26
 
HEARD YOUR FEEDBACK TODAY TOO.
AND SO A

[Captioner] 21:34:29
 WORKING SESSION WILL BE 
NOTICED AND THEN THAT

[Captioner] 21:34:32
 WAY 
EVERYONE WHO WOULD LIKE TO JOIN

[Captioner] 21:34:35
, 
WE'LL DEDICATE A MEETING FOR 
THAT.


[Captioner] 21:34:39
AT THIS TIME I ALSO HAVE ITEM

[Captioner] 21:34:42
 7A 
WHICH IS COUNCILMEMBER JONES HAS 
A

[Captioner] 21:34:46
 REFERRAL FOR HONORING

[Captioner] 21:34:48
 A 
DRIVEWAY AT THE POLICE 
DEPARTMENT.


[Captioner] 21:34:51
WOULD YOU LIKE TO SHARE PLEASE.
>> Councilmember Jones:   THANK 
YOU, MADAM

[Captioner] 21:34:54
 MAYOR.
KIND OF INTERESTINGS.

[Captioner] 21:34:57

I SUBMITTED THE REFERRAL, IT WAS 
THREE SENTENCES AND

[Captioner] 21:35:00
 STAFF HAS 
VERY ELOQUENTLY ADDRESSED ALL OF 
THE

[Captioner] 21:35:04
 ISSUES IN THE AGENDA ITEM 
THAT YOU SEE BEFORE YOU

[Captioner] 21:35:07
.
BUT ESSENTIALLY WHAT IT IS IS, 
SEEKING

[Captioner] 21:35:11
 COUNCIL APPROVAL TO 
PLACE A COMMEMORATIVE

[Captioner] 21:35:14
 SIGN 
HONORING OUR RETIRED

[Captioner] 21:35:17
 POLICE 
CHIEF CRAIG STECKLER IN THE EAST 
DRIVEWAY

[Captioner] 21:35:21
 OF THE POLICE 
DEPARTMENT, THAT'S THE DRIVEWAY 
THAT GOES TO THE EAST

[Captioner] 21:35:24
 ENTRANCE 
TO THE POLICE DEPARTMENT TO THE 
PROPERTY STORAGE FACILITY TO THE

[Captioner] 21:35:27
 
ANIMAL SHELTER AND TO THE DOG 
PARK.


[Captioner] 21:35:30
AND THOSE FACILITIES WERE 
CONSTRUCT

[Captioner] 21:35:34
ED WHILE FORMER CHIEF 
STECKLER

[Captioner] 21:35:38
 WAS CHIEF OF POLICE AND 
HE WAS VERY INSTRUMENTAL IN 
GETTING

[Captioner] 21:35:42
 THOSE FACILITIES 
APPROVED.
AND FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND IS 


[Captioner] 21:35:45
CURRENTLY AT THE DOG PARK JUST 
ABOUT EVERY DAY NOW.
SO YOU KNOW

[Captioner] 21:35:48
 THEY DO SEE.

[Captioner] 21:35:52

HE IS FREQUENTING HIS OWN 
FACILITY THAT

[Captioner] 21:35:55
 HE HELPED TO 
CONSTRUCT BACK IN THE

[Captioner] 21:35:59
 LATE 
'90s EARLY 2000s

[Captioner] 21:36:02
.
SO I HAD A

[Captioner] 21:36:06
 LONG DISCUSSION WITH 
STAFF THIS IS NOT AN ISSUE

[Captioner] 21:36:09
 THAT 
LET'S NAME A STREET, IT WOULD

[Captioner] 21:36:12
 
REQUIRE CHANGES ADDRESSES THOSE 
KINDS OF THINGS.


[Captioner] 21:36:15
THAT WAS NOT MY INTENT.
MY INTENT WAS SIMPLY

[Captioner] 21:36:18
 TO PLACE A 
SIGN AT THE ENTRANCE OF THAT 
DRIVEWAY

[Captioner] 21:36:21
 COMMEMORATING HIS 
SERVICE TO THE CITY AND

[Captioner] 21:36:25
 HIS 
TENURE AS POLICE CHIEF FROM 1992

[Captioner] 21:36:28
 
TO 2012 WHICH ENDED A DRIVE YEAR 
CAREER IN LAW ENFORCEMENT

[Captioner] 21:36:30
.
THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 21:36:33
ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS FROM 
COUNCILMEMBERS

[Captioner] 21:36:37
?
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN.

[Captioner] 21:36:39

>> Councilmember Salwan:   I 
JUST WANT TO SAY I TOO SUPPORT 


[Captioner] 21:36:43
THIS EFFORT.
THANKS FOR COUNCILMEMBER JONES 
FOR

[Captioner] 21:36:46
 TAKING THE LEAD.
CHIEF STECKLER HAS BEEN

[Captioner] 21:36:49
 A VERY 
DISTINGUISHED POLICE CHIEF AND 
HAS SERVED

[Captioner] 21:36:53
 FREMONT WITH 
DISTINCTION FOR MANY, MANY YEARS 
AND I THINK THIS WOULD BE A

[Captioner] 21:36:55
 VERY 
FITTING HONOR TO HAVE THIS NAMED 
AFTER HIM.


[Captioner] 21:36:59
SO I WOULD SUPPORT THIS AND 
HAPPY TO SECOND THIS

[Captioner] 21:37:01
.
>> Mayor Mei:   AGAIN TO 
CLARIFY, THIS IS NOT TO CHANGE 


[Captioner] 21:37:05
THE ROAD BUT TO HAVE A PLAQUE

[Captioner] 21:37:08
.
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN.
>> Councilmember Kassan:   YES, 


[Captioner] 21:37:11
YES, I DON'T WANT TO DENY ALL OF 
THE CONTRIBUTIONS THAT CHIEF

[Captioner] 21:37:15
 
STECKLER MADE BUT IT DOES 
CONCERN ME TO DO SOMETHING LIKE 


[Captioner] 21:37:18
THIS.
I THINK IT CREATES A BIT OF A 
SLIPPERY SLOPE

[Captioner] 21:37:21
 AND COULD -- 
SIMILAR TO WHEN WE

[Captioner] 21:37:26
 DO 
PROCLAMATIONS, SOME PEOPLE CAN 
FEEL

[Captioner] 21:37:30
 LEFT OUT, SOME PEOPLE CAN 
FEEL LIKE -- WONDER WHY

[Captioner] 21:37:33
 THEY 
WEREN'T RECOGNIZED.
I THINK WE SHOULD LIMIT

[Captioner] 21:37:36
 THESE 
KINDS OF THINGS TO POSSIBLY 
AFTER PEOPLE

[Captioner] 21:37:39
 HAVE PASSED AWAY.
SO I PERSONALLY WOULD NOT BE IN 
SUPPORT OF

[Captioner] 21:37:42
 THIS.

[Captioner] 21:37:49

>> Councilmember Jones:   IF

[Captioner] 21:37:53
 
THERE ARE NO OTHER COMMENTS --
>> Mayor Mei:   WE HAVE

[Captioner] 21:37:57
 A MOTION 
IN THIS AND SECOND FOR THIS 
REFERRAL SO IF YOU

[Captioner] 21:38:00
 COULD PLEASE 
VOTE.


[Captioner] 21:38:09
THE REFERRAL PASSES

[Captioner] 21:38:12
 WITH 
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN VOTING NAY

[Captioner] 21:38:14
 
AND COUNCILMEMBER SHAO BEING 
ABSENT.


[Captioner] 21:38:19
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 21:38:23
AND AT THIS TIME, WE HAVE NO 
APPOINTMENTS AND

[Captioner] 21:38:26
 NO LEGISLATIVE 
ACTIONS.

[Captioner] 21:38:29

AND THEN IS THERE ANY REPORT ON 
COMMITTEE

[Captioner] 21:38:32
 ASSIGNMENTS?
SIEG NONE

[Captioner] 21:38:36
SEEING NONE, I'D LIKE TO CALL --

[Captioner] 21:38:39

>> Councilmember Cox:   I WAS 
GOING TO SAY SOMETHING

[Captioner] 21:38:42
.
>> Mayor Mei:   ON A COMMITTEE 
ASSIGNMENT?


[Captioner] 21:38:45
OKAY, I APOLOGIZE I DON'T SEE 
YOUR BUTTON PUSHED

[Captioner] 21:38:48
 SO --

[Captioner] 21:38:53
 
COUNCILMEMBER COX.


[Captioner] 21:39:01
>> Councilmember Jones:   
MICROPHONE.
>> Councilmember Cox:   SERVE 


[Captioner] 21:39:04
OUR COMMUNITY.
AS I SERVE THE

[Captioner] 21:39:07
 COMMUNITY ON THE 
EAST BAY COMMUNITY

[Captioner] 21:39:11
 ENERGY AS AN 
ALTERNATE

[Captioner] 21:39:14
 REPRESENTATIVE, EAST 
BAY COMMUNITY ENERGY IS ONE OF 
OUR

[Captioner] 21:39:17
 CLEAN ENERGY PROVIDERS IN 
THE UNITED STATES.

[Captioner] 21:39:21

AND THEY'RE PARTNERING WITH A 
FIRM THAT'S

[Captioner] 21:39:25
 CALLED COLUSA WHICH 
IS A LEADING

[Captioner] 21:39:28
 ENERGY SOFTWARE 
PLATFORM.
AND BASICALLY THIS PLATFORM

[Captioner] 21:39:33
 IS 
DEALING WITH THE VEHICLE GRID 
INTEGRATION KNOWN

[Captioner] 21:39:37
 AS VGI.
IT'S A PROGRAM THAT ALLOWS US

[Captioner] 21:39:41
 TO 
BE ABLE TO BOOST THE GRID

[Captioner] 21:39:45
 
RESILIENCE, REDUCE ENERGY COST, 
AND MITIGATE

[Captioner] 21:39:48
 CARBON EMISSIONS 
ASSOCIATED WITH ELECTRICAL

[Captioner] 21:39:51
 
VEHICLE CHARGING.
SO THE LAUNCH OF THIS NEW 


[Captioner] 21:39:54
SERVICE OCCURRED JUST LAST 
MONTH.
AND IT'S

[Captioner] 21:39:58
 ALSO FOLLOWS A GRID 
EMERGENCY IN CALIFORNIA.
WHEN WE WERE

[Captioner] 21:40:02
 EXPERIENCING THE 
HEAT WAVES, WHEREBY

[Captioner] 21:40:05
 THE ELECTRIC 
VEHICLE DRIVERS WERE ASKED TO 
AVOID CHARGING

[Captioner] 21:40:08
 AT CERTAIN TIMES.
WELL GUESS WHAT?

[Captioner] 21:40:11

THIS SOFTWARE WILL HELP TO 
RELIEVE THE PRESSURE OF

[Captioner] 21:40:16
 THE 
POWER OUTAGES BY SHIFTING

[Captioner] 21:40:19
 ALL 
THE CHARGING AWAY FROM PEEK

[Captioner] 21:40:23
 PEAK 
TIMES AND ALLOWS THE DRIVERS TO 
USE THE

[Captioner] 21:40:26
 CAR WHEN THEY NEED TO 
AND THEY CAN PLUG IN AS THEY 
NEED

[Captioner] 21:40:29
 TO PLUG AND PLAY AND GO.
SO THIS TYPE OF

[Captioner] 21:40:32
 NEW TECHNOLOGY 
IS SERVICING CLOSE TO ABOUT

[Captioner] 21:40:36
 
1,000 ELECTRICAL VEHICLE DRIVERS 
IN CALIFORNIA

[Captioner] 21:40:39
.
AND COLUSA WILL

[Captioner] 21:40:43
 UNABLE DRIVERS 
TO BE ABLE TO REALLY SET AND BE 
ABLE TO GET

[Captioner] 21:40:47
 THEIR CAR READY 
THROUGHOUT MOBILE APP

[Captioner] 21:40:50
 AND ALSO 
BE ABLE TO OPTIMIZE VEHICLE 
CHARGING

[Captioner] 21:40:53
 TO OCCUR WHEN ENERGY IS 
CHEAPER AND GREENER

[Captioner] 21:40:56
.
AND THE SERVICE CAN ENABLE THE 
AVERAGE ELECTRICAL VEHICLE

[Captioner] 21:41:00
 TO 
SAVE OVER $550 A YEAR AND REDUCE 
THEIR

[Captioner] 21:41:03
 CHARGING CARBON EMISSIONS 
BY 36%.

[Captioner] 21:41:06

SO I'M REALLY WELCOMING A LOT OF 
THE

[Captioner] 21:41:09
 ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING 
PLATFORMS THAT CAN BE

[Captioner] 21:41:12
 DONE TO 
HELP THOSE THAT HAVE CHOSEN

[Captioner] 21:41:15
 TO 
HAVE THE ELECTRICAL VEHICLES

[Captioner] 21:41:19
 AS 
THEIR CHOICE OF TRANSPORTATION.
SO IT'S SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT

[Captioner] 21:41:22
 
AND MAYBE THERE COULD BE SOME 
OTHER FUTURE PARTNERSHIPS

[Captioner] 21:41:25
 AS WE 
WORK THROUGH OUR

[Captioner] 21:41:28
 CITIES IN 
REPRESENTING AS ONE OF THE 
ALTERNATE BOARD

[Captioner] 21:41:32
 MEMBERS.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 21:41:35
>> Mayor Mei:   I ALSO NOTE THAT 
EAST BAY COMMUNITY ENERGY RIGHT

[Captioner] 21:41:38
 
NOW DROVE A LOT OF OUR -- WE 
WERE CHARGING A

[Captioner] 21:41:41
 LOT OF PEOPLE TO 
TAKE ON

[Captioner] 21:41:45
 RESILIENCE IN HOMES, 
THEY ALSO HAVE A RESILIENT HOME

[Captioner] 21:41:48
 
PROGRAM WHICH IS THE OPPORTUNITY 
FOR PEOPLE TO APPLY FOR

[Captioner] 21:41:52
 TREE 
CONSULTING CONSULTATION, AND 
THEY

[Captioner] 21:41:55
 CAN RECEIVE A $500 GIFT 
CARD THERE

[Captioner] 21:41:58
 SUN RUN AFTER 
CONSULTATION.
THERE ARE MANY WAYS WE CAN

[Captioner] 21:42:01
 BE 
MORE GREEN.
THE OTHER THING I WANTED TO NOTE 


[Captioner] 21:42:05
IS FOR ALAMEDA COUNTY 
TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION, AS 
THEY MENTION

[Captioner] 21:42:08
ED PREVIOUSLY 
ADOPTED A TI POLICY

[Captioner] 21:42:11
 AND THEY 
WILL BE IMPLEMENTING THAT LENS 
BY WHICH TO IMPLEMENT

[Captioner] 21:42:14
 A LOT OF 
THEIR PROJECTS FOR ACTC AND

[Captioner] 21:42:17
 
WE'VE HAD SOME UPDATES IN 
PARTICULAR IF PEOPLE ARE 


[Captioner] 21:42:21
INTERESTED I KNOW WE GET A LOT 
OF QUESTIONS ABOUT OUR ROADWAYS

[Captioner] 21:42:24
 
AND SO THERE IS THE DLD FUND 
WHICH

[Captioner] 21:42:27
 COMES THROUGH OUR PROCESS 
WHEN WE LOOK AT CAPITAL

[Captioner] 21:42:31
 
IMPROVEMENT PROGRAMS AND SO 
THERE WAS A WATCHDOG REPORT 


[Captioner] 21:42:34
PROGRAM THAT CAME OUT FOR THAT, 
AND THAT'S AVAILABLE FOR PEOPLE 
TO

[Captioner] 21:42:37
 REVIEW IF THEY'RE INTERESTED.
I'M HAPPY TO SHARE THAT

[Captioner] 21:42:41
.
ARE THERE ANY OTHER 
COUNCILMEMBERS

[Captioner] 21:42:45
?
OKAY SEEING NONE, I'D LIKE TO 
ADJOURN

[Captioner] 21:42:48
 THE MEETING AND THANK 
YOU ALL FOR JOINING US TODAY.
AND

[Captioner] 21:42:51
 HOPE EVERYONE'S TO BE WELL

[Captioner] 21:42:55

AND ALSO,

[Captioner] 21:42:58
