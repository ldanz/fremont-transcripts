19:14:55 GOOD EVENING, CITY  COUNCILMEMBERS.

19:14:59 THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR INVITING ME HERE TONIGHT TO ACCEPT THIS PROCLAMATION.

19:15:04 WE ARE SO VERY GRATEFUL FOR YOUR LONG TIME SUPPORT OF LIFE ELDERCARE'S MEALS 
19:15:09  MEALS-ON-WHEELS PROGRAM, A CRITICAL INSTITUTION IN OUR COMMUNITY WHICH HAS 
19:15:15 PROVIDED NOURISHMENT FOR MIND, BODY AND SOUL SINCE 1975.

19:15:20 LAST YEAR, WE DELIVERED NEARLY 150,000 MEALS TO 834 ELDERS.

19:15:24 AND EACH OF THOSE SENIORS RECEIVED A FEW MINUTES OF DAILY SOCIALIZATION, AS 
19:15:29 WELL AS A DAILY WELL CHECK, AND THIS HAS LITERALLY SAVED THE LIVES OF 
19:15:33 CLIENTS WHO ARE FALLEN OR HAD ANOTHER EMERGENCY AND THEIR VOLUNTEER WHEN 
19:15:36 THEY CAME TO DELIVER THEIR MEAL WAS THE ONE WHO DISCOVERED THIS.

19:15:40 WE DEEPLY APPRECIATE YOUR PARTNERSHIP THROUGH THIS PROCLAMATION, AND THANK 
19:15:41 YOU AGAIN FOR INVITING ME TO JOIN YOU.

19:15:48 >> Vice Mayor Salwan: THANK YOU SO MUCH, DEEPA, WE REALLY APPRECIATE ALL 
19:15:52 YOU AND LIFE ELDERCARE DO FOR OUR COMMUNITY.

19:15:52 >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

19:15:53 GOODNIGHT, EVERYONE.

19:15:54 >> Vice Mayor Salwan: GOODNIGHT.

19:15:54 THANK YOU.

19:15:57 WITH THAT, WE'LL MOVE ON TO ORAL COMMUNICATIONS.

19:16:06 MADAM CITY CLERK, HOW MANY SPEAKERS DO WE HAVE FOR ORAL COMMUNICATION?

19:16:15 >> Ms. Gauthier: RIGHT NOW, WE'RE JUST SHOWING TWO.

19:16:27 MARIE AND GOPALAKRISHNAN PADMA.

19:16:32 JOHN NG IS GOING TO HELP ME WITH THE TIMER THIS EVENING AS ALBERTO IS OUT 
19:16:33 TODAY.

19:16:33 SO MARIE?

19:16:35 YOU HAVE 3 MINUTES.

19:16:39 >> Vice Mayor Salwan: I'LL JUST MAKE A QUICK STATEMENT THAT ANY PERSON WHO 
19:16:44 WISHES TO SPEAK ON A MATTER WHICH IS NOT SCHEDULED ON THIS AGENDA MAY DO SO 
19:16:48 UNDER THIS ORAL COMMUNICATION SECTION OF PUBLIC COMMUNICATIONS.

19:16:49 THANK YOU.

19:16:51 >> MY NAME IS MARIE HUGHES.

19:16:53 AND I'M A LONG TIME RESIDENT OF FREMONT.

19:16:55 GOING ON 28 YEARS NOW.

19:16:57 CURRENTLY LIVING IN NILES.

19:17:01 I WANT TO CONGRATULATE THE CITY ON HOW THE PILOT SAFE PARKING PROGRAM IS 
19:17:03 GOING.

19:17:10 I KNEW IT WAS GOING TO SPEND A MONTH IN NILES VENEER WHERE I LIVE, AND I KNOW 
19:17:13 THAT SOME OF THE RESIDENTS WERE WORRIED THAT THERE WOULD BE INCREASED TRAFFIC 
19:17:14 AND OTHER PROBLEMS.

19:17:19 BUT THE PARTICIPANTS HAVE BEEN SO QUIET THAT I DIDN'T EVEN REALIZE THAT NILES' 
19:17:21 TURN HAD COME UNTIL WE WERE HALFWAY DONE.

19:17:27 SO I WANT TO CONGRATULATE  EVERYONE THAT MADE THAT HAPPEN.

19:17:31 AND NOW THAT WE HAVE OUR PILOT PROGRAM GOING, I AM HOPEFUL THAT THE CITY WILL 
19:17:36 TURN TO IMPLEMENTING THE CITY-SPONSORED PARKING PROGRAM THAT WE ALL  WANT.

19:17:40 THE PILOT PROGRAM IS HELPFUL, BUT IT'S ONLY SERVING A SMALL SEGMENT OF OUR 
19:17:46 HOMELESS, ESPECIALLY SINCE IT DOESN'T TAKE RVs, BUT ALSO BECAUSE IT'S 
19:17:48 LIMITED TO 15 CARS PER SITE.

19:17:54 A CITY-SPONSORED PROGRAM WOULD HAVE MORE LEEWAY IN TERMS OF LAND USED AND 
19:17:58 COULD BE HELPFUL TO A LARGER SEGMENT OF FREMONT'S HOMELESS POPULATION.

19:18:04 I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO ADD TA I'M EXCITED THAT FREMONT WILL HEAR SOON FROM THE 
19:18:07 STATE ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT WE'RE AWARDED THE PROJECT HOMEKEY GRANT THAT 
19:18:08 WE APPLIED FOR.

19:18:15 I BELIEVE ADDING 156 UNITS OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN WARM SPRINGS BY 
19:18:19 TURNING THE CURRENTLY CRIME-RIDDEN AREA AROUND MOTEL 6 INTO A PLACE WHERE 
19:18:24 PEOPLE LIVE AND SHOP WILL IMPROVE LIFE IN THAT AREA DRAMATICALLY.

19:18:26 THANK YOU.

19:18:28 >> Ms. Gauthier: THANK YOU.

19:18:37 THE NEXT SPEAKER IS GP  ALAKRISHNAN PADMA.

19:18:38 >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

19:18:40 YOU PRONOUNCE MY NAME REALLY NICELY.

19:18:41 I APPRECIATE THAT VERY MUCH.

19:18:49 I'M HERE ONCE AGAIN TO TALK ABOUT HOW DISTRAUGHT I AM TO LEARN THAT THE CITY 
19:18:53 IS FOCUSING ON NON-CRITICAL ISSUES FUNDED BY GRANTS WITH STRINGS ATTACHED 
19:18:57 INSTEAD OF FOCUSING ON TRAFFIC CONGESTION, CRIME AND SAFETY AND 
19:18:57 HOMELESSNESS.

19:19:01 AND THIS TIME I'M TALKING ABOUT THE SABERCAT EXTENSION PROJECT.

19:19:07 SABERCAT HAS MANY ELEVATION CHANGES AS YOU WALK ON IT, UPS AND DOWNS, IT HAS 
19:19:14 TURNS WHERE YOU HAVE POOR VISIBILITY TO ONCOMING PEOPLE, UNLIKE THE ALAMEDA 
19:19:21 CREEK TRAIL WHICH IS VERY FLAT AND YOU CAN SEE FOR A VERY LONG DISTANCE, AND 
19:19:22 IS STRAIGHT.

19:19:27 HOUR, SABERCAT IS MOSTLY USED BY PEOPLE WHO ARE ON FOOT AND OCCASIONALLY YOU 
19:19:28 RUN INTO A BICYCLE.

19:19:32 AND IT'S A TRAIL WITH A LOT OF HISTORY AND SUPPORTS MANY ECOSYSTEMS AND IT 
19:19:37 WILL BE  BEST -- IF WE TRY TO PAVE IT OR TRY TO WIDEN IT FOR MIXED USE.

19:19:44 OUR OWN PARKS AND RECREATION PLAN THAT HAS BEEN POSTED SHOWS THAT BY 2034, 
19:19:48 ONE-THIRD OF FREMONT'S POPULATION WILL BE 55 AND OLDER.

19:19:52 CAN YOU IMAGINE THEM WALKING ON THE SABERCAT TRAIL AND RUNNING INTO A 
19:19:56 BICYCLE GOING 15 MILES PER HOUR AND COMING AROUND CORNERS?

19:19:58 HOW WOULD THAT BE FOR THAT SENIOR CITIZEN?

19:20:03 IF WE WANT TO ENCOURAGE OHLONE STUDENTS TO TAKE THE BART AND BIKE TO COLLEGE, 
19:20:05 YES, THAT'S A FANTASTIC THING.

19:20:09 LET'S THEN FINISH THE LAST HALF MILE OF BIKE LANES ON WASHINGTON BOULEVARD SO 
19:20:13 THAT THEY CAN GET OFF THE BART, GET ON WASHINGTON BOULEVARD AND THEN ON 
19:20:15 MISSION BOULEVARD AND GET TO OHLONE.

19:20:20 WE DO NOT NEED A FANCY $40 MILLION WALKING BRIDGE TO ACCOMPLISH THIS.

19:20:24 EVEN IF WE GET A MAJORITY OF THE MONEY FROM GRANTS, THERE IS STILL CITY OF 
19:20:29 FREMONT MONEY WHICH IS TAXPAYER MONEY THAT WILL BE USED FOR THIS, AND I DO 
19:20:36 NOT WANT AS A TAXPAYER THAT MONEY TO BE USED FOR A WALKING BRIDGE OR TO EXTEND 
19:20:39 THE SABERCAT FOR MULTIUSE.

19:20:43 WE COULD PUT OUR MONEY TO BETTER USE, WE HAVE OUR SIDEWALKS THAT ARE IN 
19:20:47 DISREPAIR, WHICH IS FORCING PEOPLE TO WALK ON THE ROAD AND MAKING IT UNSAFE 
19:20:50 FOR THEM, PARTICULARLY AT NIGHT.

19:20:56 WE HAVE TRAFFIC SIGNALS THAT ARE VERY OUTDATED AND ARE MUCH OLDER THAN MANY 
19:20:57 OTHER CITIES.

19:20:58 WE COULD FUND THAT.

19:21:00 THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS WE CAN DO WITH THIS MONEY.

19:21:08 SO PLEASE, DO NOT WIDEN  SABERCAT, DO NOT MAKE IT A MULTIPURPOSE, MULTIUSE 
19:21:09 SYSTEM.

19:21:12 WE DON'T WANT THE WALKING BRIDGE FROM BART TO OHLONE.

19:21:16 PLEASE, LET'S FOCUS ON REAL PROBLEMS FOR FREMONT AND PUT OUR MONEY TO GOOD 
19:21:16 USE.

19:21:17 THANK YOU.

19:21:22 >> Ms. Gauthier: THANK YOU.

19:21:25 THE NEXT SPEAKER IS LISA DANZ.

19:21:37 LISA?

19:21:38 >> SORRY.

19:21:40 IT TOOK A MINUTE TO POP UP.

19:21:46 HI, I'M A FREMONT RESIDENT AND I JUST WANT TO REITERATE WHAT MARIE SAID IN 
19:21:51 SUPPORT OF  PROGRAMS TO HELP US SOLVE  HOMELESSNESS, PARTICULARLY THE PROJECT 
19:22:00 HOMEKEY PROJECT IS GOING TO BE A REAL BENEFIT TO THE COMMUNITY TO BRING MORE 
19:22:01 AFFORDABLE HOUSING TO OUR COMMUNITY.

19:22:02 SO THANK YOU AGAIN FOR SUPPORTING IT.

19:22:04 >> Ms. Gauthier: THANK YOU.

19:22:07 THE NEXT SPEAKER IS MEENA.

19:22:18 SORRY, IT LOOKS LIKE MEENA HAS DROPPED OFF THE CALL.

19:22:25 TODD LANGTON, YOU'RE SPEAKING ON ITEMS THAT ARE NOT ON THE  AGENDA?

19:22:29 >> YES, I AM, AND I ALSO WANTED TO ADDRESS THE MEALS-ON-WHEELS.

19:22:33 I'M WITH THE COALITION FOR THE UNHOUSED OF SILICON VALLEY.

19:22:36 AND THEN ALSO AGAPE SILICON VALLEY.

19:22:41 AGAPE SILICON VALLEY HAS NUMEROUS WONDERFUL VOLUNTEERS THAT GO OUT AND 
19:22:43 SERVE THE UNHOUSED THERE IN FREMONT.

19:22:51 WE WERE DISCUSSING ABOUT THE CONCERN OF HAVING FOLLOW-UP WITH OUR DISCUSSIONS 
19:22:57 THAT WE HAD LAST WEEK IN THE CITY COUNCIL MEETING REGARDING CURTAILING 
19:23:04 THE SWEEPS, THE ABATEMENTS, AND GETTING ON TOP OF THE ISSUE OF THE LEGALITY OF 
19:23:06 THESE SWEEPS AND THESE  ABATEMENTS.

19:23:11 ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO THE SUPREME COURT DECISION OF MARTIN VERSUS BOISE 
19:23:15 THAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOMEWHERE FOR THESE UNHOUSED TO GO IF YOU'RE GOING 
19:23:17 TO ABATE THEM.

19:23:23 LOVE THE MEALS-ON-WHEELS  PROGRAM, JUST A REMINDER TO THE CITY THAT I WOULD 
19:23:29 SAY AT LEAST 30, 40% OF THE UNHOUSED ARE SENIORS AGED 60-PLUS.

19:23:35 WE HOPE THAT YOU WOULD -- IT'S KIND OF OBVIOUS BUT WE WOULD HOPE YOU WOULD 
19:23:38 DEFINITELY INCLUDE THE UNHOUSED FOR THOSE MEALS AND WHEELS AND SERVE THEM 
19:23:39 THOSE MEALS ALSO.

19:23:41 A BIG FAN OF SAFE PARKING.

19:23:46 PILOT PROGRAM FOR 15 CARS IS NOT ENOUGH, YOU'VE GOT TO GET THE  RVs IN 
19:23:54 THERE, WE NEED AT LEAST A HUNDRED OR SO VEHICLES, RVs AND CARS AVAILABLE FOR 
19:23:55 SAFE PARKING IN FREMONT.

19:23:56 PROJECT HOMEKEY, WONDERFUL.

19:23:59 TRANSITIONAL HOUSING IS DESPERATELY NEEDED.

19:24:05 MAYOR LACARDO OF SAN JOSÉ  ADMITTED HIS BIGGEST MISTAKE OF HIS TENURE AS MAYOR 
19:24:08 IS NOT GETTING ENOUGH TRANSITIONAL HOUSING.

19:24:13 I URGE THE CITY OF FREMONT TO GET AHEAD OF THE GAME, GET AHEAD OF THE PROBLEM, 
19:24:18 DON'T FALL DECADES BEHIND LIKE SAN JOSÉ HAS REGARDING THE HOMELESSNESS 
19:24:18 PROBLEM.

19:24:24 IF YOU HAVE SOMEWHERE TO SLEEP WHERE YOU CAN LOCK THE DOOR AND YOU CAN FEEL 
19:24:28 SAFE AT NIGHT AND SAFE LEAVING DURING THE DAY AS NEEDED AS AN UNHOUSED 
19:24:32 PERSON, YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE PROGRESS IN GETTING BACK TO A NORMAL LIFESTYLE.

19:24:34 SO TRANSITIONAL HOUSING, EXTREMELY IMPORTANT.

19:24:39 PLEASE DON'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE SAN JOSÉ HAS MADE WHERE THREE, FOUR YEARS 
19:24:41 FROM NOW, IT'S GOING TO BE A MONSTER OUT OF CONTROL.

19:24:48 OUR UNHOUSED IN FREMONT, 80% OF THEM LIVE THERE IN FREMONT BEFORE THEY 
19:24:49 BECAME UNHOUSED.

19:24:51 LET'S GET THEM THE SUPPORT THEY NEED.

19:24:56 AGAIN, JUST A REMINDER, MEALS-ON-WHEELS SHOULD BE  SERVING MEALS TO THOSE 
19:24:57 60-PLUS THAT ARE UNHOUSED ALSO.

19:25:02 MARTIN VERSUS BOISE, AGAIN, JUST A REMINDER.

19:25:07 THERE'S LEGAL PRECEDENCE FOR DEFINITELY HAVING A PLACE FOR THE UNHOUSED TO GO 
19:25:09 IF YOU'RE GOING TO ABATE THEM.

19:25:13 WE HOPE THAT YOU WOULD PUT ALL THE ABATEMENTS ON PAUSE AND ON HOLD UNTIL 
19:25:18 YOU GET THAT FIGURED OUT, AND WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE PROCESS OF YOU 
19:25:20 RESPONDING TO OUR COMMENTS ON A WEEKLY BASIS.

19:25:20 THANK YOU SO MUCH.

19:25:28 >> Ms. Gauthier: THE NEXT SPEAKER IS MEENA.

19:25:33 >> HELLO, CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS.

19:25:34 CAN YOU HEAR ME?

19:25:38 SORRY, THE FIRST TIME YOU CALLED MY NAME, I WASN'T ABLE TO  UNMUTE.

19:25:42 THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK HERE.

19:25:47 I VOICE THE SAME OPINION THAT  TODD JUST POINTED OUT.

19:25:53 I'VE WORKED WITH AGAPE SILICON VALLEY AS WELL, I'VE BEEN A FREMONT RESIDENT 
19:25:57 FOR ALMOST 15 YEARS NOW, I'VE BEEN SERVING THE UNHOUSED COMMUNITY HERE ON 
19:25:58 BEHALF OF AGAPE.

19:26:04 THE RECENT SWEEPS THAT HAVE BEEN GOING ON ARE A TAD  HEARTBREAKING.

19:26:10 I CAME TO THE CITY COUNCIL MEETING LAST WEEK TO REQUEST TO PUT A HOLD ON IT 
19:26:16 BEFORE WE HAVE A PLAN OF ACTION ON WHERE WE ARE GOING TO PLACE THOSE THAT 
19:26:18 WERE REMOVED FROM THEIR TENTS.

19:26:23 I DID NOT SEE IN THE MINUTES THAT BEING ADDRESSED, SO JUST WANTED TO BRING IT 
19:26:28 UP HERE AND AS TODD REQUESTED, IT WOULD BE GREAT IF WE CAN GET AN UPDATE ON A 
19:26:32 REGULAR WEEKLY BASIS ON WHERE WE ARE AT IN THAT PROCESS.

19:26:39 I TALK TO THE UNHOUSED FOLKS, MY FRIENDS AROUND THE COMMUNITY ON A 
19:26:44 WEEKLY BASIS, SOMETIMES ON A DAILY BASIS, AND THEY HAVE BEEN IN HIGH 
19:26:49 ANXIETY ALERT BECAUSE OF THE UNKNOWN SITUATION OF THEIR LIVING CONDITIONS, 
19:26:52 NOT KNOWING WHEN THEY'RE GOING TO BE SWEPT, NOT KNOWING WHERE THEY ARE 
19:26:59 GOING TO GO FOLLOWING A SWEEP, AND FOR ME, NOT BEING ABLE TO LOCATE THEM IS 
19:27:03 VERY SCARY BECAUSE IT MEANS THEY'RE OUT THERE ON THE STREETS IN VERY DANGEROUS 
19:27:03 LIVING CONDITIONS.

19:27:10 I AM ALL IN FOR SAFE PARKING AND HOUSE KEY PROJECTS.

19:27:14 IF WE CAN TAKE A LOOK AT IT AND CREATE A LONG TERM PLAN BEFORE WE GO OUT AND 
19:27:18 DO THE SWEEPS, THAT WOULD BE GREATLY APPRECIATED.

19:27:22 I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE STATUS OF THE REQUEST THAT WE MADE 
19:27:24 LAST WEEK IN THE CALL IS.

19:27:27 ARE THEY PUTTING A PASS ON THE SWEEPS FOR NOW?

19:27:31 IF NOT, WHAT ARE THE AREAS THAT ARE GOING TO BE SWEPT AND WHAT TIME?

19:27:35 IT WOULD BE GREAT FOR ADVOCATES LIKE US TO KNOW THAT DETAIL SO WE CAN HELP 
19:27:39 PREPARE OUR FOLKS.

19:27:44 THAT IS THE MINIMUM WE CAN DO, EVEN IF WE ARE NOT -- THE SWEEPS NOW.

19:27:45 SO PLEASE KEEP US POSTED.

19:27:50 IT DOESN'T HELP TO BE BLINDED TO WHAT IS COMING.

19:27:54 IT IS A LITTLE SCARY FOR US AS WELL AS FOR OUR UNHOUSED NEIGHBORS.

19:27:54 THANK YOU.

19:27:56 >> Ms. Gauthier: THANK YOU.

19:27:58 THE NEXT SPEAKER IS KELLY ABREU.

19:28:03 >> THANK YOU.

19:28:11 I'D LIKE TO BRIEFLY ADDRESS THE IMPORTANCE OF INTERCONNECTED TRAILS 
19:28:17 AND IT'S THE HEIGHT OF IRONY AND SELF INTEREST WHEN WE HEAR LOCAL RESIDENTS 
19:28:21 WHO LIVE ALONGSIDE A VERY NICE TRAIL  CALLED THE SABERCAT TRAIL, RUNS 
19:28:27 THROUGH A BEAUTIFUL SCENIC CANYON IN DISTRICT -- I THINK IT'S DISTRICT 5 
19:28:32 NEAR MISSION SAN JOSÉ IN FREMONT, AND THEY WANT TO -- NOW THAT THEY'VE GOT 
19:28:38 THEIR LITTLE TRAIL, THEY WANT TO PULL UP THE LADDERS AND CUT THEMSELVES OFF 
19:28:43 FROM THE REST OF THE CITY AND MAKE SURE THAT NOBODY FROM IRVINGTON CAN GET 
19:28:48 OVER THE FREEWAY AND GO AND WALK UP THE TRAIL AND ENJOY A NICE WALK ALONG THAT 
19:28:49 SCENIC CORRIDOR.

19:28:55 THE SELF-INTEREST HERE IS BEING CLOAKED AS COST CUTTING AND COST SAVINGS AND 
19:29:02 FINDING A MORE COST-EFFECTIVE WAY TO SPEND THE CITY'S MONEY, IT'S CROCODILE 
19:29:05 TEARS IN TERMS OF COST CUTTING.

19:29:10 IF THE CITY HAS A NICE PLAN FOR CONNECTING THAT TRAIL AND  BRINGING 
19:29:16 IRVINGTON, GIVING IRVINGTON A CHANCE TO WALK ALONG THE SABERCAT TRAIL AND IT'S 
19:29:17 A GOOD PLAN.

19:29:17 THANK YOU.

19:29:23 >> Vice Mayor Salwan: THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO ALL THE SPEAKERS.

19:29:24 WE'VE HEARD EVERYONE.

19:29:27 WE CAN'T TAKE ANY ACTION.

19:29:30 DO YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY, MS. SHACKELFORD?

19:29:35 >> City Mgr. Shackelford: YES, QUICKLY TO RESPOND TO THE LAST TWO SPEAKERS, 
19:29:40 I'D LIKE TO OFFER WE CAN HAVE OUR HOMELESS  SERVICES MANAGER, LORI 
19:29:44 BORES, CONTACT THEM TO CONFIRM WHAT OUR PROCESS IS FOR ABATEMENTS.

19:29:47 >> Vice Mayor Salwan: THANK YOU.

19:29:53 WITH THAT, WE'LL GO BACK TO ITEMS THAT WERE REMOVED FROM CONSENT.

19:29:56 WE HAD ITEM 2G.

19:30:02 SO I THINK IT WAS MR. HINDS WHO HAD SOME CONCERN?

19:30:02 >> Ms. Gauthier: CORRECT.

19:30:06 DO YOU WANT TO OPEN -- WE CAN OPEN THAT PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD.

19:30:07 HOW MANY MINUTES?

19:30:11 OR SORRY, FOR ITEMS REMOVED FROM CONSENT, WE TYPICALLY DO A MINUTE.

19:30:14 WE'VE BEEN DOING A MINUTE FOR THE LAST SEVERAL MEETINGS.

19:30:16 >> Vice Mayor Salwan: I'LL GO WITH THAT, SURE.

19:30:18 >> Ms. Gauthier: ALL RIGHT.

19:30:19 JOHN, ARE YOU READY?

19:30:22 MR. HINDS?

19:30:40 >> Vice Mayor Salwan: MR. HINDS, ARE YOU THERE?

19:30:46 >> Ms. Gauthier: WE'RE UNMUTED AT OUR END.

19:30:54 >> IS YOU HEAR ME NOW?

19:30:55 >> Ms. Gauthier: YES.

19:30:56 >> THAT'S INTERESTING.

19:30:59 I NEVER GOT THE REQUEST FROM YOU TO UNMUTE.

19:30:59 OKAY.

19:31:05 THE NUMBERS THAT ARE -- THIS YEAR ARE VERY SIM IMLAR TO WHAT THEY WERE A 
19:31:05 YEAR AGO.

19:31:12 THE CURRENT RATE PLAN IS -- THE PREMIUM RATE IS $625,000 A YEAR, THE PREMIUM 
19:31:15 AMOUNT IN ABSOLUTE TERMS IS 100,000, WHICH IS SORT OF IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD 
19:31:17 OF A FULL TIME EMPLOYEE.

19:31:20 WHAT DO WE GET FOR THAT?

19:31:25 THE CURRENT RATE PLAN IS ALREADY 86% CARBON-FREE, THE PREMIUM PLAN IS 100% 
19:31:32 CARBON-FREE SO TO SQUEEZE OUT THAT LAST 14% OF CARBON COSTS US $100,000.

19:31:37 AS WE KNOW LAST YEAR THERE ARE OTHER LARGE ECONOMIES IN THE WORLD 
19:31:43 PARTICULARLY INDIA AND CHINA WHO PLAN TO -- AGAINST THAT BACKGROUND OUR 14% 
19:31:44 REDUCTION IS MOSTLY SYMBOLIC.

19:31:49 PLEASE STICK WITH THE CHEAPER PLAN AND USE THAT $100,000 FOR SOMETHING MORE 
19:31:53 PRACTICAL, MORE TANGIBLE, LIKE THE REQUESTS YOU'RE GOING TO GET FROM 
19:31:55 PARKS AND REC. TONIGHT.

19:31:55 THANK YOU.

19:31:58 >> Vice Mayor Salwan: THANK YOU, MR. HINDS.

19:32:03 WE'LL BRING IT BACK TO COUNCIL AND I THINK THE MAYOR MEI HAVE JOINED US.

19:32:05 I'LL TURN IT BACK OVER TO THE MAYOR.

19:32:08 >> Mayor Mei: YES, SO THANK YOU.

19:32:13 I JUST WANTED TO SAY, I THINK WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE -- SOUNDS LIKE OF PUBLIC 
19:32:15 COMMENTS SO I WANTED TO SEE IF WE FINISHED ALL THE SPEAKERS.

19:32:18 I APOLOGIZE, I WAS HAVING SOME CONNECTION ISSUES EARLIER.

19:32:23 >> Ms. Gauthier: WE JUST HAD PUBLIC COMMENT ON ITEM 2G THAT WAS REMOVED 
19:32:25 FROM THE CONSENT CALENDAR.

19:32:33 TO WE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS FROM COUNCIL OR DO YOU WANT TO MAKE A MOTION TO 
19:32:33 VOTE ON THAT?

19:32:40 >> Councilmember Jones: I'M READY TO MAKE A MOTION.

19:32:42 >> Mayor Mei: OKAY, I WAS JUST LOOKING FOR A HAND.

19:32:43 THANK YOU.

19:32:45 CAN I HAVE A MOTION, PLEASE?

19:32:48 >> Councilmember Jones: I'LL MOVE TO APPROVE STAFF RECOMMENDATION.

19:32:50 I THINK THIS TAKES US IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

19:32:55 I KNOW THAT WE WENT WITH THE CHEAPER PLAN BECAUSE OF BUDGET INSTABILITY.

19:32:59 HOWEVER, WE'VE GOT THE NEW OUTLOOK ON THAT, AND I THINK IT'S THE RIGHT THING 
19:33:03 TO DO TO TRY AND GO TO 100% CARBON-FREE.

19:33:05 >> Councilmember Cox: SECOND.

19:33:07 >> Vice Mayor Salwan: I SECOND.

19:33:12 >> Ms. Gauthier: MOTION IS FROM COUNCILMEMBER JONES, SECOND, I THINK I 
19:33:13 HEARD COUNCILMEMBER COX NEXT?

19:33:15 >> Councilmember Cox: CORRECT.

19:33:16 >> Mayor Mei: OKAY.

19:33:17 ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE.

19:33:20 >> Ms. Gauthier: COUNCILMEMBER COX, AYE.

19:33:24 COUNCILMEMBER SHAO, AYE.

19:33:27 COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, AYE.

19:33:29 AND I'M SUPER GRATEFUL FOR THIS, THANK YOU.

19:33:32 >> Ms. Gauthier: COUNCILMEMBER JONES, AYE.

19:33:34 COUNCILMEMBER KENG, AYE.

19:33:36 VICE MAYOR SALWAN, AYE.

19:33:39 MAYOR MEI, AYE.

19:33:40 SO THE MOTION PASSES.

19:33:50 >> 5A.

19:33:51 >> Mayor Mei: INTRODUCE THE ITEM, PLEASE.

19:33:52 LET ME LOOK.

19:33:53 I APOLOGIZE.

19:34:00 >> Ms. Gauthier: THIS IS ASSOCIATE PLANNER MARK HUNGERFORD AND DONOVAN 
19:34:09 LOZARO WILL -- 40517 ALBRAE STREET.

19:34:11 >> Mayor Mei: IF WE COULD HAVE THE PAREN TAIG, THAT WOULD BE GREAT.

19:34:12 THANK YOU.

19:34:15 >> GOOD EVENING, MAYOR, MEMBERS OF THE CITY COUNCIL.

19:34:17 ALLOW ME TO PULL UP A  POWERPOINT.

19:34:36 THE PROJECT BEFORE YOU NOW IS A REQUEST FOR ENTITLEMENT APPROVAL FOR AN 
19:34:41 INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT OF APPROXIMATELY 397,000 SQUARE FEET OF NEW FLOOR AREA 
19:34:47 SPREAD ACROSS THREE BUILDINGS ON A ROUGHLY 22.4-ACRE PORTION OF THE 
19:34:50 GLOBAL PLANNED DISTRICT THAT WAS NEVER DEVELOPED SUBSEQUENT TO APPROVAL OF 
19:34:51 THE PROJECT.

19:34:55 APPROVAL IS REQUIRED FOR THE PROJECT CONSISTS OF A GENERAL PLAN AMENDMENT 
19:35:00 TO REDESIGNATE FROM REGIONAL COMMERCIAL TO TECH INDUSTRIAL, A REZONING OF THE 
19:35:07 SITE FROM THE GLOBE PLANNED DISTRICT TO PRELIMINARIARY AND PRECISE PLANNED 
19:35:15  DISTRICT 121-160, A VESTING TENTATIVE PARCEL MAP AND ADDENDUM TO THE 
19:35:18 PREVIOUS ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT CERTIFIED FOR THE GLOBE.

19:35:23 THE PROJECT SITE IS COMPRISED OF LAND THAT WAS ENVISIONED FOR DEVELOPMENT AS 
19:35:26 PART OF A LARGER INTERNATIONAL THEMED COMMERCIAL CENTER CALLED THE GLOBE.

19:35:31 THE GLOBE PLANNED DISTRICT WAS APPROVED IN 2007 AND PRIOR TO ADOPTION OF THE 
19:35:35 GLOBE, A GENERAL PLAN AMENDMENT WAS APPROVED, REDESIGNATING THE CURRENT 
19:35:38 PROJECT SITE FROM INDUSTRIAL TO COMMERCIAL.

19:35:42 ONLY A PORTION OF THE GLOBE LAND DEVELOPED, HOWEVER, AND THOSE ARE THE 
19:35:45 MOST VISIBLE PORTIONS OF THE PLANNED DISTRICT ALONG STEVENSON BOULEVARD.

19:35:51 THE MORE INTERIOR PORTIONS OF THE GLOBE, THE SITE OF THIS PROPOSED 
19:35:52 DEVELOPMENT, NEVER REDEVELOPED THIS PLAN.

19:35:56 EXISTING STRUCTURES THAT ARE ON THE PROPERTY BOTH AROUND 80,000 SQUARE 
19:36:03 FEET IN SIZE AND  PRE-DATING THE ADOPTION OF THE GLOBE HAVE BEEN VACANT 
19:36:06 FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AND THE SITE HAS BEEN A SOURCE OF BLIGHT.

19:36:11 LOOKING BIG PICTURE, THE SITE IS LOCATED WITHIN THE CITY'S BAYSIDE 
19:36:12 INDUSTRIAL COMMUNITY PLAN AREA.

19:36:17 ON THE MAP ON THE PRESENTATION SLIDE, THE PROJECT SITE IS INDICATED BY A 
19:36:20 YELLOW STAR, AND INDUSTRIALLY DESIGNATED LANDS ARE IDENTIFIED IN 
19:36:22 SHADES OF  BLUE.

19:36:27 COMMERCIALLY DESIGNATED LANDS LIKE THE GLOBE PLANNED DISTRICT AND PACIFIC 
19:36:29 COMMONS ARE SHOWN IN RED.

19:36:36 AS YOU CAN SEE, THE PROJECT SITE IS BOUNDED ON THREE SIDES BY INDUSTRIALLY 
19:36:40 DESIGNATED LAND AND IS LOCATED WITHIN AN AREA OF DENSE INDUSTRIAL 
19:36:45  DEVELOPMENT THAT'S GENERALLY BOUNDED BY  I-880, STEVENSON BOULEVARD AND 
19:36:46 AUTOMALL PARKWAY.

19:36:53 THIS SLIDE TAKES A FINER VIEW OF THE IMMEDIATE AREA AND SHOWS THE 
19:36:55 DESIGNATIONS OF PROPERTIES AROUND THE PROJECT SITE.

19:37:00 SERVICE AND TECH INDUSTRIAL USES ARE DESIGNATED AREAS RATHER SURROUND THE 
19:37:05 SITE ON THREE SIDES AND WAL-MART ACROSS ALBRAE STREET IN THE BUILT-OUT 
19:37:09 PORTIONS OF THE GLOBE ADJACENT TO THE SITE WITH FRONTAGES ON STEVENSON 
19:37:10 BOULEVARD CARRY COMMERCIAL DESIGNATIONS.

19:37:18 THE INDUSTRIAL PROPERTIES ARE PRIMARILY DEVELOPED WITH MANUFACTURING, LIGHT 
19:37:19 INDUSTRIAL, AND WHOLESALE AND DISTRIBUTION USES.

19:37:23 AND THE COMMERCIAL PROPERTIES ARE DEVELOPED WITH WAL-MART AND WITHIN THE 
19:37:28 BUILT-OUT PORTIONS OF THE GLOBE, A MIX OF PRIMARILY RESTAURANT AND PERSONAL 
19:37:29 SERVICE USES.

19:37:35 THIS IS THE PROPOSED SITE PLAN FOR THE PROJECT.

19:37:41 IT CONSISTS OF THREE BUILDINGS, THE TWO LARGEST OF WHICH ARE LOCATED ON THE 
19:37:41 SOUTHEAST PORTION OF THE SITE.

19:37:44 A THIRD SMALLER BUILD SOMETHING LOCATED ON THE  NORTH-NORTHWESTERN END OF THE 
19:37:44 SITE.

19:37:51 NO SPECIFIC USES ARE PROPOSED FOR EACH BUILDING BUT THEY ARE DESIGNED AS 
19:37:54 FLEXIBLE SPACES THAT COULD ACCOMMODATE FUTURE ADVANCED MANUFACTURING, 
19:37:59 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, E-COMMERCE AND DISTRIBUTION, AND WAREHOUSE USERS, 
19:37:59 AMONG OTHERS.

19:38:03 ALL OF THESE USES ARE CONSISTENT AND COMPATIBLE WITH INDUSTRIAL USES IN THE 
19:38:09  VICINITY OF THE SITE AND ALSO CONSISTENT WITH THE I T-ZONING 
19:38:13 DISTRICT WHICH IS WHAT THE PROPOSED DISTRICT IS MODELED AFTER AND WHOSE 
19:38:16 LAND USE AND DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS WOULD BE IN EFFECT FOR THE SITE SHOULD 
19:38:17 THE PROJECT BE APPROVED.

19:38:22 THE PROJECT WILL HAVE TWO ACCESS DRIVES OFF ALBRAE STREET, THE PRIMARY OF 
19:38:24 WHICH ALIGNED WITH THE DRIVEWAY OF WAL-MART AND THIS INTERSECTION WOULD 
19:38:25 BE SIGNALIZED.

19:38:31 THE PROJECT ALSO FEATURES THREE ACCESS DRIVES OFF ENCYCLOPEDIA CIRCLE, TWO OF 
19:38:36 WHICH ARE SIZED FOR TRUCK INGRESS EGRESS AND ONE SMALLER DRIVE IN THE 
19:38:39 CENTER OF THE SITE THAT IS DESIGNED FOR PASSENGER VEHICLES.

19:38:46 THE SITE WOULD ALSO FEATURE DIRECT ACCESS TO STEVENSON BOULEVARD VIA AN 
19:38:48 EXISTING INTERIOR DRIVE THAT CUTS THROUGH THE BUILT-OUT PORTIONS OF THE 
19:38:48 GLOBE.

19:38:53 AS DESIGNED AND CONDITIONED, ALL TRUSK TRAFFIC TO AND FROM THE SITE WOULD 
19:38:56 HAVE TO USE ENCYCLOPEDIA CIRCLE ACCESS POINTS.

19:39:00 THEY WOULD BE PROHIBITED FROM USING ALBRAE STREET DRIVEWAYS AND THE 
19:39:04 INTERIOR DRIVE CONNECTION TO STEVENSON BOULEVARD AS A MEANS OF PUBLIC SAFETY 
19:39:08 AND EFFICIENCY BY WAY OF SEPARATING ANY TRUCK TRIPS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SITE 
19:39:12 FROM EXISTING ROUTES THAT ARE PRIMARILY USED BY PASSENGER VEHICLES.

19:39:17 NOW I'LL BRIEFLY GO THROUGH THE THREE BUILDINGS.

19:39:22 BUILDING ONE WOULD BE THE  LARGEST.

19:39:26 IT WOULD HAVE FRONTAGE ON ALBRAE STREET AND ITS TRUCK COURT WOULD BE LOCATED 
19:39:29 ON ITS BACK SIDE, SCREENED FROM PUBLIC RIGHT-OF-WAY AND ADJACENT PROPERTY 
19:39:29 VIEW.

19:39:34 THE BUILDING HAS BEEN DESIGNED TO PRESENT AN INTERESTING AND REFINED 
19:39:38 FACE WITH CORNER ELEMENTS CREATING A SENSE OF INTEREST AND LANDMARKING THE 
19:39:41 LOCATION OF THE BUILDING'S LIKELY ENTRANCE AND OFFICE  AREAS.

19:39:46 THIS DESIGN THEME IS CARRIED ON THROUGHOUT THE PROJECT AND STAFF HAS 
19:39:50 FOUND THE PROJECT AND  BUILDING DESIGN TO BE CONSISTENT WITH THE CITYWIDE 
19:39:52 DESIGN GUIDELINES AND PLACE FOR INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT.

19:40:03 BUILDING TWO IS SHAPED AND ORIENTED MUCH LIKE BUILDING ONE BUT WITH ITS 
19:40:06 FRONT FACED TOWARDS ENCYCLOPEDIA CIRCLE.

19:40:11 WITH A CLEAN, REFINED ELEVATION ALONG THE STREET FRONTAGE AND TRUCK COURTS 
19:40:11 THAT ARE HIDDEN FROM VIEW.

19:40:19 BUILDING THREE IS MUCH SMALLER THAN THE OTHER TWO BUILDINGS AND TAILORED MORE 
19:40:21 TO A POTENTIAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT USER.

19:40:26 IT FEATURES A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF FENESTRATION ALONG ITS ALBRAE STREET 
19:40:30 ELEVATION, AND ALSO CARRIES THROUGH WITH THE CONTEMPORARY LOOK OF THE 
19:40:30  PROJECT.

19:40:35 HERE ARE A COUPLE OF RENDERINGS OF THE PROJECT.

19:40:41 THE TOP IMAGE IS OF BUILDING TWO AS SEEN FROM ENCYCLOPEDIA  CIRCLE.

19:40:46 AND THE BOTTOM IMAGE IS A VIEW OF THE PROJECT FROM ALBRAE STREET WITH 
19:40:48 BUILDING 1 ON THE LEFT SIDE AND BUILDING 3 ON THE RIGHT SIDE.

19:40:53 AS YOU CAN SEE, SIDEWALKS AND PARKWAYS ADJACENT TO THE SITE WOULD BE EXPANDED 
19:40:57 AND UPGRADED TO BE DESIGNED TO CITY  STANDARDS, INCLUDING THE PLANTING OF 
19:41:02 STREET TREES AND ON SITE THE PROJECT WOULD FEATURE 25-FOOT-WIDE FULLY 
19:41:07 LANDSCAPED SETBACK AREAS, ABUTTING THE SIDEWALK AND PARKWAY THAT WOULD 
19:41:12 FURTHER SERVE TO ENHANCE THE LOOK OF PROJECT FRONTAGES AND IMPROVE THE 
19:41:12 SIGHT TO ITS NEIGHBORS.

19:41:17 ADDITIONALLY THE PROJECT WOULD AT 207 TREES TO THE SITE WHICH CURRENTLY 
19:41:19 FEATURES NONE DUE TO PAST DEMOLITION ACTIVITIES.

19:41:25 A GENERAL PLAN AMENDMENT WOULD BE NECESSARY TO PERMIT A  REZONING OF THE 
19:41:27 SITE FOR INDUSTRIAL USE.

19:41:32 THE GENERAL PLAN AMENDMENT PROPOSED WOULD REDESIGNATE THE SITE FROM 
19:41:36 REGIONAL COMMERCIAL TO TECH INDUSTRIAL, A DESIGNATION CONSISTENT WITH THE 
19:41:41 ADJACENT PROPERTY DESIGNATIONS IN THE GREATER BAYSIDE INDUSTRIAL AREA THAT 
19:41:44 THE PROJECT LIES WITHIN.

19:41:49 IT INCLUDING ALL NEW SIDEWALKS AND PARKWAYS ALONG THE  FRONTAGES, 
19:41:54 WIDENING OF THE ENCYCLOPEDIA CIRCLE WALKWAY, NEW TRAFFIC SIGNALS AT THE 
19:41:58 WAL-MART INTERSECTION AND ENCYCLOPEDIA CIRCLE STEVENSON BOULEVARD 
19:42:04 INTERSECTION WHICH WOULD HANDLE THE PROJECT'S TRUCK TRAFFIC, PLUS A PLEDGE 
19:42:08 OF $500,000 THAT COULD BE USED FOR FURTHERING CITY INITIATIVES AT THE 
19:42:09 DISCRETION OF THE CITY COUNCIL.

19:42:17 AN ECONOMIC ANALYSIS WAS  PREPARED BY A LOCAL ECONOMIST FOR THE PROJECT.

19:42:21 THIS ANALYSIS WAS PROVIDED IN THE HEARING MATERIALS AS INFORMATIONAL 
19:42:24 ITEM 3 AND SUMMARIZED IN THE STAFF REPORT.

19:42:29 FOLLOWING MY PRESENTATION, I WILL HAND IT OFF TO DONOVAN, ECONOMIC 
19:42:32 DEVELOPMENT MANAGER, TO DISCUSS THE SCOPE AND OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY AND 
19:42:33 SUMMARIZE ITS FINDINGS.

19:42:38 >> THANK YOU, MARK, AND GOOD EVENING, COUNCIL.

19:42:43 AT THE REQUEST OF THE CITY, BERKELEY-BASED CONSULTANT STRATEGIC 
19:42:46 ECONOMICS PERFORMED A MARKET ASSESSMENT AND ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF THE PROPOSED 
19:42:53  PROJECTS, WHICH INCLUDED THE MARKET POTENTIAL TO DEVELOP NEW REGIONAL 
19:42:57 RETAIL AS ALLOWED UNDER CURRENT LAND USE DESIGNATION, THE MARKET POTENTIAL 
19:43:04 FOR THE PROPOSED SPECULATIVE INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENTICALLY INCLUDING THE TYPES 
19:43:07 OF TENANTS THAMED LIKELY LOCATE AT THE PROPOSED SITE AND THE ECONOMIC IMPACT 
19:43:08 AND FISCAL BENEFITS OF THE PROJECT.

19:43:14 THEIR ANALYSIS CONCLUDED THAT THE VIABILITY OF A FUTURE RETAIL PROJECT 
19:43:21 AT THE PROPOSED SITE FACES MANY HEADWINDS INCLUDING REGIONAL DECLINE 
19:43:27 PER HOUSEHOLD THAT FAVORS REEXISTING IN EXISTING CENTERS OVER BUILDING NEW 
19:43:27 ONES AND A CITY STRATEGY.

19:43:34 IN ADDITION, THE SUBJECT SITS BETWEEN PACIFIC COMMONS AND THE NEW PARK MALL, 
19:43:40 WHICH ANY NEW RETAIL PROJECT AT THE SITE WOULD NEED TO COMPETE WITH AND 
19:43:46 THE PACIFIC COMMONS TRADE AREA MORE THAN SIGNIFICANTLY --  CONVERSELY, THE 
19:43:50 STUDY FOUND THAT DEMAND FOR INDUSTRIAL SPACE IN FREMONT IS VERY STRONG ACROSS 
19:43:54 ALL SUBSECTORS INCLUDING ADVANCED MANUFACTURING, RESEARCH AND 
19:43:56 DEVELOPMENT, WAREHOUSING, AND DISTRIBUTION.

19:44:00 THIS CONCLUSION ALLIANCE WITH CONVERSATIONS THAT OUR TEAM HAS HAD 
19:44:05 WITH LOCAL BROKERS AND INDUSTRIAL TENANTS WHO WE ENGAGE WITH REGULARLY, 
19:44:08 AND WE WOULD EXPECT A MIX OF THESE USES TO LOCATE TO THE PROJECT IF BUILT.

19:44:11 NEXT SLIDE, PLEASE.

19:44:19 BASED ON THIS LIKELY PUBLIX OF USES THAT COULD BE EXPECTED TO LOCATE TO 
19:44:23 PROJECT IF IT IS  BUILT, THE PROJECT WOULD SUPPORT 650 NEW JOBS UPON FULL 
19:44:24  OCCUPANCY.

19:44:29 WHILE EACH INDUSTRIAL SUBSECTOR AND EACH INDIVIDUAL INDUSTRIAL USER IS 
19:44:33 DIFFERENT FROM THE NEXT, WE WOULD EXPECT A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF THESE 
19:44:37 JOBS TO BE CLASSIFIED AS MIDDLE INCOME, WHICH IS IN THE MIDDLE THREE QUINTILES 
19:44:39 OF THE INCOME  SPECTRUM.

19:44:46 FOR FISCAL BENEFITS, THE CITY WOULD CONSERVATIVELY GENERATE $305,000 IN 
19:44:49 RECURRING GENERAL FUND REVENUE BETWEEN A MIX OF PROPERTY, SALES AND BUSINESS 
19:44:54 TAX, WHICH WOULD REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY $3 MILLION OVER 10 YEARS 
19:44:56 FOLLOWING THE FULL  BUILDOUT OF THE PROJECT.

19:45:03 IT'S WORTH NOTING THAT THE SCHOOL DISTRICT WOULD RECEIVE APPROXIMATELY 
19:45:06 $2.8 MILLION OVER THIS SAME PERIOD FRL THE NET INCREASE IN PROPERTY TAX.

19:45:12 THE PROJECT WOULD ALSO PROVIDE $3 MILLION IN ONE-TIME CAPITAL, FIRE, 
19:45:14 TRAFFIC AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING IMPACT FEES.

19:45:18 SOME ADDITIONAL BENEFITS OF THE PROJECT INCLUDE ROADWAY AND SIGNAL 
19:45:22 IMPROVEMENTS IN ADDITION TO THE VOLUNTEER CONTRIBUTION THAT MARK 
19:45:23 TOUCHED UPON.

19:45:26 THAT CONCLUDES THE STAFF PORTION OF THE PRESENTATION.

19:45:29 WE ARE AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE.

19:45:37 IN ADDITION, DEREK BRAUN FROM STRATEGIC ECONOMICS IS AVAILABLE TO ANSWER 
19:45:39 QUESTIONS.

19:45:42 >> I WILL PICK BACK UP, WE HAVE A FEW MORE SLIDES TO GO THROUGH.

19:45:48 SO IN ORDER TO REDEVELOP THE PROJECT, OR TO DEVELOP THE PROJECT, RATHER, 
19:45:50 REZONING IS ALSO NECESSARY.

19:45:55 THE REQUESTED REZONING WOULD CHANGE THE ZONING OF THE SITE FROM THE GLOBE'S 
19:45:58 PLANNED DISTRICT TO A NEW PLANNED DISTRICT THAT WOULD BE BASED OFF THE 
19:46:01 LAND USE AND DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS OF THE I.T. ZONING DISTRICT.

19:46:05 NO EXCEPTIONS TO THE I.T. ZONE LAND USE STANDARDS ARE PROPOSED.

19:46:09 AND FUTURE LAND USE AND  DEVELOPMENT WOULD BE SUBJECT TO I.T. ZONE 
19:46:12 REGULATIONS PER THE PROPOSED PLANNED DISTRICT GUIDELINES.

19:46:16 THE PLANNED DISTRICT DESIGN IS ONE THAT CONTEXTUALLY FITS WITHIN THE SITE AND 
19:46:19 MINIMIZES IMPACTS ON SURROUNDING USES THROUGH SITE DESIGN MEASURES AND 
19:46:22 CONDITIONS ON TRUCK ACCESS TO THE SITE.

19:46:27 IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE  DEVELOPMENT, SITE WOULD ALSO BE SUBDIVIDED INTO 
19:46:29 THREE LOTS, ONE PER BUILDING.

19:46:33 LOTTING IS CONSISTENT WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE I.T. ZONE AND 
19:46:37 EASEMENTS FOR PRIVATE CROSS-LOT ACCESS AND CIRCULATION WOULD BE RECORDED.

19:46:47 AN ADDENDUM TO THE PREVIOUSLY SUBMITTED EIR AND SUPPLEMENTAL  EIR HAS BEEN 
19:46:48 PREPARED FOR THE PROJECT.

19:46:55 AN ADDENDUM WAS PREPARED BECAUSE IT WAS FOUND THAT IMPACTS RESULTING FROM 
19:46:58 BUILDOUT OF THE PROPOSED PROJECT WOULD BE THE SAME OR LESS THAN IMPACTS IN 
19:47:01 THE PREVIOUS CEQA ANALYSIS OR BUILDOUT IN THE FORMER PROJECT.

19:47:06 NO NEW SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS WOULD RESULT FROM THE PROPOSED  DEVELOPMENT AND NO 
19:47:08 NEW MITIGATION WAS FOUND NECESSARY.

19:47:12 PRIOR MITIGATION MEASURES APPLICABLE TO THE PROJECT HAVE BEEN CARRIED OVER AND 
19:47:14 INCLUDED IN THE PROJECT'S CONDITIONS OF APPROVAL.

19:47:22 WRITTEN CORRESPONDENCE HAS BEEN RECEIVED CHALLENGING THE USE OF AN 
19:47:23 ADDENDUM FOR THE PROJECT.

19:47:27 THE CITY'S ENVIRONMENTAL CONSULTANT HAS PREPARED A RESPONSE MEMO WITH FURTHER 
19:47:31 DETAIL SUPPORTING THE USE OF AN ADDENDUM AND NO FURTHER ENVIRONMENTAL 
19:47:33 REVIEW BEING NECESSARY FOR THE PROJECT.

19:47:38 THE WRITTEN CORRESPONDENCE HAS BEEN PROVIDED AS INFORMATIONAL ITEM 5 IN 
19:47:42 YOUR PACKETS AND THE RESPONSE MEMO HAS BEEN PROVIDED AS INFORMATIONAL ITEM 6.

19:47:48 THE AUTHOR OF THE ADDENDUM AND THE RESPONSE MEMO, REBECCA ALT, IS HERE 
19:47:51 TONIGHT TO HELP ANSWER QUESTIONS FROM THE COUNCIL IF YOU HAVE ANY.

19:48:03 ON FEBRUARY 24TH, 2022, THE PLANNING COMMISSION RECEIVED PRESENTATION AND 
19:48:03 TESTIMONY ON THE PROJECT.

19:48:10 AFTER A MOTION, WITH AN ADDED CONDITION WAS MADE BUT DID NOT RECEIVE A 
19:48:11 SECOND.

19:48:15 A SUBSEQUENT MOTION TO RECOMMEND APPROVAL OF THE PROJECT AS  PROSED 
19:48:17 RECEIVED A SECOND AND PASSED 5-1.

19:48:25 STAFF SUPPORTS THE PROJECT FOR REASONS MENTIONED AND EXPLAINED UPON IN THE 
19:48:28 STAFF REPORT AND RECOMMENDS, ALONG WITH THE PLANNING COMMISSION, THAT THE CITY 
19:48:33 COUNCIL ADOPT A RESOLUTION ADOPTING THE EIR ADDENDUM AND ITS MITIGATION 
19:48:37 MONITORING AND REPORTING PROGRAM, ADOPT A RESOLUTION APPROVING THE GENERAL 
19:48:42 PLAN AMENDMENT REDESIGNATING THE SIGHT FROM REGIONAL COMMERCIAL TO TECH 
19:48:45 INDUSTRIAL, INTRODUCE AN ORDINANCE FOR THE PRELIMINARY AND PRECISE PLANNED 
19:48:49 DISTRICT REZONING IN THE ASSOCIATED  PLANNED DISTRICT GUIDELINES, AND 
19:48:53 APPROVE A VESTING TENTATIVE PARCEL MAP FOR THE PROJECT.

19:48:57 THAT CONCLUDES STAFF'S PRESENTATION AND WE'RE AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY 
19:48:58 QUESTIONS.

19:48:58 THANK YOU.

19:49:00 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:49:05 AT THIS TIME, I'D LIKE TO TURN TO THE COUNCIL FOR ANY  CLARIFYING QUESTIONS.

19:49:08 I SEE COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN.

19:49:12 >> Councilmember Kassan: THANK YOU.

19:49:15 I WAS TOLD JUST ABOUT AN HOUR OR SO BEFORE THIS MEETING BY SOMEONE FROM 
19:49:23 THE TEAMSTERS THAT THE PROJECT PROPONENT HAD ACTUALLY AGREED TO 
19:49:29 SPECIFY THAT THEY WOULD NOT ALLOW THE USE  FOR -- A USE OF A LAST MILE 
19:49:33 DELIVERY CENTER FOR THIS PROJECT AND THAT THEY WOULD ACTUALLY COMMIT TO 
19:49:33 THAT.

19:49:35 IS THAT TRUE OR NOT?

19:49:41 >> THAT HAS NOT BEEN RELAYED TO STAFF BUT PERHAPS THAT'S SOMETHING THEY 
19:49:44 COULD TOUCH UPON IN THEIR PRESENTATION.

19:49:47 >> Councilmember Kassan: I'M GOING TO HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS IF THAT'S NOT 
19:49:48 TRUE.

19:49:51 I KNOW IT'S MAYBE OUT OF ORDER, BUT COULD WE GET AN ANSWER TO THAT?

19:50:01 BECAUSE I THINK THAT WOULD HAVE A BIG EFFECT ON OUR ANALYSIS OF THIS ITEM.

19:50:08 >> I BELIEVE WE HAVE TODD BARRY HILL AND MATT CARLSON.

19:50:11 COULD ONE OF YOU ADDRESS THAT QUESTION?

19:50:11 >> SURE.

19:50:12 THANKS, EVERYONE.

19:50:16 WE HAVE SPOKEN WITH TEAMSTERS.

19:50:21 THEIR CONCERN WAS THIS SITE WAS AN AMAZON FACILITY, WHICH IT IS NOT.

19:50:25 I DO HAVE INFORMATION IN MY PRESENTATION THAT WILL TALK ABOUT KIND 
19:50:31 OF SOME OF THE OTHER USERS WE HAVE TALKED TO, NOT BY NAME BECAUSE OF 
19:50:38 NDAs, BUT WE'RE REASSURING TO THE TEAMSTERS THAT THIS IS NOT AN AMAZON 
19:50:43 FACILITY AND WE ARE WARY OF PUTTING A BLANKET PROHIBITION ON LAST MILE 
19:50:48 DELIVERY BECAUSE AS I'LL TOUCH ON IN MY  PRESENTATION, THERE'S PLENTY OF 
19:50:54 REALLY GOOD TENANTS THAT ARE POSITIVE AND THEY'RE NOT THE SCARY, SUPER 
19:50:59 INTENSIVE VAN DELIVERY TENANTS THAT I THINK THE LAST MILE KIND OF 
19:51:02 NOMENCLATURE PROJECTS.

19:51:07 SO NO, WE HAVE NOT AGREED TO A TOTAL PROHIBITION OF ANY TYPE OF LAST MILE 
19:51:10 USAGE FOR THOSE TO REASONS.

19:51:13 >> Councilmember Kassan: ARE YOU WILLING TO MAKE ANY COMMITMENTS 
19:51:18 REGARDING THE LIMITATION ON WHO THE POTENTIAL TENANTS MIGHT BE, OR ARE YOU 
19:51:22 NOT WILLING TO MAKE ANY COMMITMENTS IN THAT REGARD?

19:51:28 >> THE ONLY COMMITMENT THAT I'M MAKING IS THAT AMAZON IS NOT THE TENANT FOR 
19:51:28 THIS PROJECT.

19:51:34 THAT WAS THE CONCERN THAT TEAMSTERS HAD TO ME, SO THAT WAS WHAT I TOLD THEM, 
19:51:36 AND THERE'S MANY REASONS THAT THIS SITE DOESN'T WORK FOR THEM.

19:51:43 IT DOES, HOWEVER, WORK FOR OTHER TYPES OF WHAT COULD BE CALLED LAST MILE 
19:51:50 USERS SUCH AS LIKE A MAJOR RETAILER, WHO HAS APPLIANCES THAT NEED TO 
19:51:54 DELIVER DIRECTLY TO CONSUMERS AND I DON'T THINK THAT'S NECESSARILY THE 
19:51:57 TYPE OF USER THAT IS AS OF CONCERNING.

19:52:03 YOU I'VE ALSO GOT INFORMATION I CAN SHARE THAT SHOWS YOU KIND OF WHAT THE 
19:52:07 LAST MILE SYSTEM THAT YOU'RE THINKING OF, AN AMAZON OR SOMETHING SIMILAR AND 
19:52:11 WHAT A SITE LIKE THAT LOOKS LIKE, AND YOU'LL SEE IT LOOKS NOTHING LIKE THIS 
19:52:12 SITE.

19:52:12 >> Councilmember Kassan: OKAY.

19:52:19 SO IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE NOT PLANNING TO LEASE TO THAT TYPE OF USER, SO I'M 
19:52:23 WONDERING IF YOU WOULD BE WILLING TO PUT THAT IN WRITING SINCE YOU'RE 
19:52:26 SAYING YOU HAVE NO PLANS TO LEASE TO THAT TYPE OF USER AND THE SITE IS NOT 
19:52:28 APPROPRIATE FOR THAT TYPE OF USER.

19:52:37 ARE YOU WILLING TO PUT THAT COMMITMENT INTO BRIGHTING, LIKE INTO THE 
19:52:39 COMMITMENTS THAT YOU MAKE AS PART OF THE APPROVAL?

19:52:43 >> SURE, I WOULD HAVE TO, YOU KNOW, DEFER TO STAFF ON HOW THEY WOULD WANT 
19:52:44 SOMETHING LIKE THAT WRITTEN.

19:52:49 I KNOW THAT OUT OF ALL THE INDUSTRIAL AREA IN THE CITY, I THINK THERE'S 
19:52:53 THOUSANDS, I THINK I HEARD 6,000 ACRES OF IT, NONE OF THEM HAVE THAT 
19:52:54 RESTRICTION ON IT.

19:52:59 I DON'T KNOW WHY THIS SITE WOULD BE ANY DIFFERENT, IT'S WELL LOCATED FOR LAST 
19:53:06 MILE USE, AND THE WAY I THINK ABOUT IT, AS I SAID, FOOD DELIVERY, YOU KNOW, 
19:53:10 APPLIANCE DELIVERY, THINGS LIKE THAT, THE ACTUAL SITE PLAN ITSELF ISN'T GOOD 
19:53:16 FOR AN  AMAZON-TYPE USE, SO I WOULD DEFER TO STAFF ON KIND OF HOW THEY'D 
19:53:17 WANT THAT WRITTEN UP.

19:53:21 WE WANT THIS TO BE A FLEXIBLE PROJECT, WE THINK IT'S GOING TO BE A MIX OF 
19:53:26 DIFFERENT GOOD TENANTS AND OBVIOUSLY AS THE DEVELOPER, WE WANT TO HAVE 
19:53:29 FLEXIBILITY IN.

19:53:31 >> Councilmember Kassan: OKAY.

19:53:39 IT'S DIFFICULT BECAUSE IT'S HARD TO MAKE A DECISION IF IT'S  NOT -- IF 
19:53:42 IT'S NOT A CLEAR -- IT'S NOT CLEAR WHETHER THIS IS A COMMITMENT OR NOT.

19:53:44 BUT I DO HAVE SOME OTHER QUESTIONS.

19:53:49 >> Mayor Mei: WHY DON'T WE GO BACK TO THE OTHER QUESTIONS?

19:53:51 WE ALSO HAVE A PRESENTATION.

19:53:54 THE DEVELOPER WILL BE MAKING A PRESENTATION TOO SO I WAS GOING TO ASK 
19:53:57 FOR CLARIFYING QUESTIONS ON THE PRESENTATION THUS FAR FROM THE STAFF.

19:54:06 >> Councilmember Kassan: SO I NOTICE THAT THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT AND 
19:54:15 UNAVOIDABLE IMPACT IN TERMS OF AIR QUALITY THAT IS NOT ABLE TO BE 
19:54:16  MITIGATED.

19:54:18 I'M JUST WONDERING WHY THAT WASN'T DISCUSSED MORE.

19:54:26 IT SEEMS LIKE THAT WAS BURIED IN THE REPORT AND COULD EASILY BE MISSED, 
19:54:30 THAT THE IMPACT IS GOING TO EXCEED THE THRESHOLD OF THE BAY AREA AIR QUALITY 
19:54:34 MANAGEMENT ALLOWABLE THRESHOLDS.

19:54:38 I'M WONDERING WHY THAT WASN'T DISCUSSED AND WHAT WE CAN DO ABOUT THAT.

19:54:41 >> THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION.

19:54:49 WE DO HAVE REBECCA AULD TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL DETAILS AND RELATED TO MY 
19:54:53 RESPONSE, BUT AN ADDENDUM WAS PREPARED BECAUSE THE PROJECT WAS FOUND TO HAVE 
19:54:59 LOWER AIR QUALITY EMISSIONS, LOWER GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS THAN THE 
19:54:59 PREVIOUS PROJECT.

19:55:05 AND AS SUCH, THERE WAS NO ADDITIONAL MITIGATION NECESSARY AND THE PROJECT 
19:55:07 FELL UNDER  THE -- OR THE EXISTING IMPACTS THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY 
19:55:14 IDENTIFIED FOR THE FORMER PROJECT, AND, THEREFORE, NO SUBSEQUENT ENVIRONMENTAL 
19:55:15 WAS REQUIRED.

19:55:19 >> Councilmember Kassan: OKAY.

19:55:26 BUT EVEN THOUGH IT IS LOWER, IT IS STILL ABOVE THE ALLOWABLE THRESHOLDS 
19:55:28 FOR THE BAY AREA QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT.

19:55:29 AND THEN I DID HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION.

19:55:35 I SAW IN THE RESPONSE TO THE COMMENT LETTER, I SAW THAT IN LOOKING AT THE 
19:55:41 VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED GENERATED BY THE PROJECT, THAT ONLY EMPLOYEE TRIPS ARE 
19:55:46 TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT AND THE VMT FOR POTENTIAL DELIVERIES IS NOT INCLUDED 
19:55:47 IN THAT.

19:55:48 THAT REALLY, REALLY CONCERNS ME.

19:55:56 I KNOW A LOT OF OUR RESIDENTS ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT  TRAFFIC, AND IF THIS 
19:56:01 DOES END UP BEING A FACILITY THAT HAS A LOT OF DRIVERS COMING IN AND OUT, I'M 
19:56:08 VERY CONCERNED THAT THE VMT ANALYSIS DID NOT LOOK AT THE POTENTIAL IMPACT 
19:56:09 FROM DELIVERY TRIPS.

19:56:13 I UNDERSTAND THAT'S NOT REQUIRED, BUT IT SEEMS LIKE SOMETHING WE SHOULD KNOW 
19:56:13 ABOUT.

19:56:24 >> PER THE STATE OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH  GUIDELINES, VMT ACCOUNTS FOR 
19:56:29 ESSENTIALLY COMMUTE TRIPS, EMPLOYEE TO WORK COMMUTE TRIPS AND DOES NOT FACTOR 
19:56:34 IN ANY TRIPS THAT WOULD BE ASSOCIATED WITH DELIVERIES.

19:56:39 AND THE PROJECT FOR THE VMT ANALYSIS THAT WAS DONE IN THE TRANSPORTATION 
19:56:46 IMPACT ASSESSMENT AND SUMMARIZED IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL CHECKLIST, THE PROJECT 
19:56:47 WOULD HAVE A LOWER VMT.

19:56:54 THE PROJECT WOULD ESSENTIALLY BE BELOW VMT THRESHOLDS, WHICH WOULD BE 15% 
19:56:56 BELOW THE REGIONAL STANDARD.

19:56:59 SO THERE WAS NO --

19:57:01 >> Councilmember Kassan: BUT THAT VMT DOESN'T TAKE INTO ACCOUNT DELIVERY 
19:57:01 TRIPS AT ALL.

19:57:04 IT COMPLETELY LEAVES THAT OUT OF THE ANALYSIS.

19:57:07 SO WE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE IMPACT WOULD BE ON TRAFFIC.

19:57:13 DUE TO POTENTIAL PEOPLE DRIVING IN AND OUT TO MAKE DELIVERIES.

19:57:20 >> IF I CAN JUMP IN, THIS IS REBECCA AULD.

19:57:25 THAT IS CORRECT, THE VMT IS NOT INTENDED TO CAPTURE THAT AND IT'S NOT 
19:57:26 PART OF THE CEQA ANALYSIS.

19:57:33 AN ANALYSIS OF CONGESTION WAS ACTUALLY PERFORMED OUTSIDE OF THE CEQA 
19:57:37 ANALYSIS, AND INCLUDED AS AN INFORMATIONAL ITEM AN APPENDIX D OF 
19:57:39 THE ADDENDUM.

19:57:41 SO THAT ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED.

19:57:44 WE JUST CAN'T CAPTURE IT AS PART OF THE CEQA ANALYSIS.

19:57:50 >> Councilmember Kassan: CAN YOU SAY MORE ABOUT THAT ANALYSIS AND WHAT YOU 
19:57:54 DETERMINED IN TERMS OF IF THIS WAS A LAST MILE DELIVERY CENTER, HOW THAT 
19:57:56 WOULD AFFECT TRAFFIC?

19:58:06 >> SO AS THE CEQA CONSULTANT, I'M NOT SURE HOW DEEPLY I SHOULD GO INTO 
19:58:07 NON-CEQA ANALYSIS.

19:58:10 IT'S NOT AN IMPACT FROM A CEQA PERSPECTIVE.

19:58:16 IT WAS PERFORMED BY -- OUTSIDE OF THE CEQA WORK.

19:58:28 I THINK FAIRN PIERCE IS ON THE CALL TODAY IF THEY WANT TO RESPOND.

19:58:31 >> Councilmember Kassan: DID YOU SAY THAT WAS EXHIBIT D?

19:58:35 >> ATTACHMENT D TO WHICH DOCUMENT?

19:58:36 >> THE ADDENDUM.

19:58:37 >> Councilmember Kassan: OKAY.

19:58:43 I DON'T REMEMBER SEEING THAT.

19:58:47 CAN ANYONE ANSWER ANYTHING ABOUT THE POTENTIAL TRAFFIC IMPACTS IF THIS 
19:58:52 BECOMES A PLACE WHERE PEOPLE ARE COMING IN AND OUT TO MAKE DELIVERIES?

19:58:54 >> YEAH, GOOD EVENING.

19:58:56 SAM TABIBNIA.

19:58:59 WE'RE THE TRANSPORTATION CONSULTANTS FOR THE PROJECT.

19:59:04 WE DID DO A TRAFFIC IMPACT ANALYSIS FOR THE PROJECT.

19:59:11 SINCE THE EXACT USES OF THE SITE WERE NOT KNOWN, WE LOOKED AT THE VARIETY OF 
19:59:17 USES THAT COULD OCCUPY THE SITE, AND BASICALLY WE ESTIMATED THE TRIPS THAT 
19:59:23 THEY WOULD GENERATE AND THEN ASSIGN THAT TO THE ROADWAY AND LOOK AT HOW IT 
19:59:23 WOULD AFFECT TRAFFIC IN THE AREA.

19:59:30 AND AS A RESULT BASED ON THE CITY STANDARDS, THE PROJECT WOULD NOT 
19:59:33 EXCEED ANY OF THE CITY STANDARDS AT THE INTERSECTIONS.

19:59:40 HOWEVER, BASED ON THAT ANALYSIS, WE DID RECOMMEND THAT TWO INTERSECTIONS BEING 
19:59:40 SIGNALIZED.

19:59:47 ONE IS AT ALBRAE, THE PROJECT -- ON ALBRAE OPPOSITE WAL-MART AND THEN THE 
19:59:51 OTHER ONE IS ON STEVENSON AT ENCYCLOPEDIA.

19:59:55 >> Councilmember Kassan: OKAY, BUT THAT'S RELATED TO RIGHT -- LIKE THE 
19:59:59 CIRCULATION RIGHT AROUND THE PROJECT, BUT WHAT ABOUT VMT THAT'S GENERATED IN 
20:00:04 THE COMMUNITY IF PEOPLE ARE DRIVING AROUND THE COMMUNITY MAKING DELIVERIES?

20:00:10 DO WE HAVE ANY IDEA -- AND BY THE WAY, I DON'T SEE THAT REPORT IN THE 
20:00:10 APPENDICES.

20:00:12 I DON'T KNOW IF THAT REPORT WAS SHARED WITH US.

20:00:14 I DON'T SEE IT ANYWHERE.

20:00:19 >> I KNOW IT WAS THERE.

20:00:21 I SAW IT EARLIER TODAY.

20:00:26 BUT IN RESPONSE TO YOUR  QUESTION, THE VMT FOR THE DELIVERIES WAS NOT 
20:00:27 CALCULATED.

20:00:30 BUT THE TRIP GENERATION WAS.

20:00:35 SO THE NUMBER OF -- THE TRAFFIC, THE ACTUAL TRIPS THAT WOULD BE GENERATED 
20:00:36 COMING IN AND OUT OF THE SITE.

20:00:40 >> Councilmember Kassan: CAN YOU EXPLAIN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THOSE 
20:00:43 TWO, THE VMT VERSUS THE TRIP GENERATION?

20:00:43 >> SURE.

20:00:50 SO VMT IS VEHICLE MILES  TRAVELED, SO IT'S BASICALLY  THE -- SO ACTUALLY LET 
20:00:51 ME START WITH TRIP GENERATION.

20:00:56 SO TRIP GENERATION IS BASICALLY THE NUMBER OF VEHICLES THAT COME IN AND 
20:00:58 OUT OF THE DRIVEWAY OF THE PROJECT.

20:01:04 AND THEN VMT OR VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED, IT'S THAT TRIP GENERATION MULTIPLIED 
20:01:06 BY THE DISTANCE THAT EACH VEHICLE WOULD TRAVEL.

20:01:08 >> Councilmember Kassan: RIGHT.

20:01:12 SO WE HAVE NO IDEA HOW THIS WOULD IMPACT NEIGHBORHOODS IN TERMS OF LOCAL 
20:01:14 DELIVERIES, NO ANALYSIS WAS DONE OF THAT?

20:01:16 >> NO.

20:01:22 >> THERE WAS A TRIP GENERATION DONE, THOUGH, IN CONJUNCTION WITH SAM'S 
20:01:27 REPORT AND THESE FINDINGS ARE SUMMARIZED IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL 
20:01:29 CHECKLIST AS PART OF THE ADUNN DUMB.

20:01:36 IT ANALYZED THE PROPOSED PROJECT PLUS THE -- PLUS BUILDOUT OF THE FORMER 
20:01:37 PROJECT IN ITS ENTIRETY.

20:01:43 THE GLOBE WAS FOUND TO GENERATE 14,170 DAILY TRIPS, AND THE PROPOSED PROJECT 
20:01:44 WAS --

20:01:46 >> Councilmember Kassan: RIGHT BUT AGAIN, THAT'S JUST FOR EMPLOYEES SO I 
20:01:47 FEEL LIKE THAT'S NOT --

20:01:49 >> NEW YORK THE TRIP GENERATION IS NOT JUST EMPLOYEES.

20:01:52 THE TRIP GENERATION IS EVERYTHING.

20:01:58 DELIVERY TRUCKS, THE BIG TRUCKS THAT BRING IN THE MATERIAL.

20:02:01 >> Councilmember Kassan: RIGHT, BUT THE VMT IS WHAT TELLS US THE IMPACTS ON 
20:02:02 THE LOCAL NEIGHBORHOOD.

20:02:06 SO THE TRIP GENERATION IS JUST PEOPLE COMING IN AND OUT OF THAT PARTICULAR 
20:02:08 LOCATION, SO JUST -- WE DON'T HAVE THAT YOU AL CYST AT ALL.

20:02:12  ANALYSIS AT ALL.

20:02:17 THAT REALLY CONCERNS ME BECAUSE ONE OF THE BIGGEST COMPLAINTS WE GET IS 
20:02:17 RELATED TO LOCAL TRAFFIC.

20:02:20 BECAUSE WE AREN'T GETTING A CLEAR ANSWER ON WHETHER THERE IS A 
20:02:25 COMMITMENT THAT THIS WON'T BE THAT TYPE OF USE, THAT REALLY DOES CONCERN ME.

20:02:28 SO OKAY, I WILL -- I'LL STOP THERE.

20:02:30 THANK YOU.

20:02:35 >> IF I CAN JUMP BACK IN, I THINK PART OF THE ISSUE HERE IS THAT THE ANALYSIS 
20:02:41 THAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR IS WHETHER THIS PROJECT WOULD HAVE ANY APPRECIABLE 
20:02:45 DIFFERENCE ON THE AMOUNT THAT THE NEIGHBORHOODS ARE ORDERING ONLINE OR 
20:02:47 HAVING DELIVERED TO THEIR HOMES.

20:02:53 AND I THINK THE ANSWER IS THAT WE CANNOT MAKE THAT CONNECTION.

20:02:56 THIS SITE, BY ITSELF, WHETHER IT'S ALLOWED TO BE THAT USE OR NOT, WOULD 
20:03:00 NOT HAVE AN APPRECIABLE DIFFERENCE ON DELIVERIES TO THE NEIGHBORHOODS ONLY 
20:03:03 WHETHER OR NOT THOSE DELIVERIES COME THROUGH THIS PARTICULAR SITE.

20:03:14 >> I DO WANT TO ADD IN, COUNCILMEMBER, THERE IS, WITHIN THE PACKET, AN 
20:03:14 ADDENDUM.

20:03:20 YOU'RE LOOKING FOR ATTACHMENT D.

20:03:25 ATTACHMENT D IS 106 PAGES AND THERE'S ABOUT A REAM OF ATTACHMENT DOCUMENTS 
20:03:26 TO THE ADUNN DUMB.

20:03:32 THOSE ARE ON OUR FREMONT.GOV CEQA PAGE FOR THOSE WHO WANTED TO GO INTO THAT 
20:03:36 DEPTH, BUT THEY'RE NOT ORALLY PRINTED WITH THE BASE ENVIRONMENTAL DOCUMENT.

20:03:42 >> Councilmember Kassan: ALL RIGHT.

20:03:42 THANK YOU.

20:03:51 >> Mayor Mei: NEXT I HAVE FOR CLARIFYING QUESTIONS, COUNCILMEMBER 
20:03:52 JONES.

20:03:55 >> Councilmember Jones: THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR.

20:04:00 MR. HUNGERFORD, JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY WITH THE GLOBE OR  WITH -- AS YOU 
20:04:06 STATED, WITH THIS PROJECT THERE COULD BE RETAIL HUBS THAT ARE -- MAYBE THIS 
20:04:10 IS THEIR HUB FOR DELIVERING APPLIANCES TO THIS REGION OF THE WEST COAST.

20:04:21 DO YOU HAVE A SENSE OF WHAT AN OUTFIT LIKE THAT GENERATE MORE VEHICLE MILES 
20:04:25 TRAVELED AS OPPOSED TO WHAT THE GLOBE DID, OR WAS THE GLOBE GOING TO 
20:04:29 GENERATE A LOT OF THOSE TRIPS ANYWAY?

20:04:33 I KIND OF SEE WHAT WE'RE GETTING AT HERE OR WHAT COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN IS 
20:04:35 GETTING AT HERE WITH THE AMAZON FACILITY.

20:04:42 I THINK EVERYBODY SEES THOSE TRUCKS COMING THROUGH, BUT WHAT I THINK 
20:04:47 YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS SITE BEING IS MORE R & D, MORE MANUFACTURING, SO THE 
20:04:52 VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED, THOSE TRIPS THAT ARE GENERATED IN THE COMMUNITY 
20:04:54 WILL PROBABLY BE SIGNIFICANTLY LESS.

20:04:56 IS THAT CORRECT?

20:05:02 >> SO THERE WAS A TRIP GENERATION ANALYSIS DONE FOR THE PROJECT AND IT 
20:05:06 DIRECTLY COMPARED TO THE TRIPS GENERATED BY BUILDOUT OF THE GLOBE.

20:05:12 AS I WAS GETTING TO EARLIER, SO THE GLOBE HAD OVER 14,000 DAILY TRIPS.

20:05:17 THIS PROJECT WAS ANALYZED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE BUILT-OUT PORTION 
20:05:27 OF THE GLOBE AND FOUND TO HAVE 2,880 DAILY TRIPS, AND THAT CONTEMPLATED 
20:05:33 TRUCK TRIPS FACTORED AT TUBE VEHICLES AND USE THE HIGHEST GENERATING TRUCK 
20:05:37 CLASSIFICATION WHICH IS HIGH DAY FULFILLMENT TO GIVE US THE MOST 
20:05:41 CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATE OF TRIPS, BASICALLY, YOU KNOW, ENTERING AND 
20:05:42 EXITING THE SITE.

20:05:49 SO THE MAXIMUM KIND OF WORST-CASE SCENARIO I GUESS FROM A TRIP 
20:05:55 GENERATION STANDPOINT, BASICALLY CONSIDERING THE TWO LARGER BUILDINGS 
20:06:02 AS THIS MOST INTENSE TRIP GENERATING USE, THE PROJECT WOULD STILL HAVE OVER 
20:06:06 10,000 FEWER DAILY TRIPS THAN BUILDOUT OF THE FORMER PROJECT.

20:06:12 >> Councilmember Jones: WHERE IS THAT IN LINE WITH RECOMMENDATIONS?

20:06:17 I BELIEVE I HEARD YOU MENTION SOMETHING ABOUT 15% BELOW WHAT'S RECOMMENDED?

20:06:24 >> SO FOR VMT PURPOSES, YEAH, IT REALLY JUST LOOKS AT WHETHER THE SITE IS 
20:06:27 BELOW THE REGIONAL AVERAGE, WHICH IT IS.

20:06:35 SO THAT'S THE CEQA STANDARD AND VMT IS THE CEQA METRIC.

20:06:38 THE TRIP GENERATION FIGURES ARE MORE FOR SERVICE IMPACTS, WHICH ARE NO 
20:06:43 LONGER USED AS THE CEQA METRIC, BUT THEY'RE USED TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR 
20:06:48 NOT UPGRADES ARE NECESSARY ON THE LOCAL INFRASTRUCTURE, THE LOCAL ROADWAYS TO 
20:06:48 ACCOMMODATE FOR PROJECT IMPACTS.

20:06:59 >> Planner Pullen: COUNCILMEMBER JONES, TO TAKE THAT FROM TRIP NUMBERS TO 
20:07:04 ENVIRONMENTAL POTENTIAL ISSUES, WHEN YOU HAVE THAT DIFFERENCE IN TRIPS, THE 
20:07:11 ENVIRONMENTAL CONSULTANT ALSO RELATED THAT TO ELECTRIC TON CO2 AND FOUND 
20:07:15 THAT THE ORIGINAL PROJECT WOULD HAVE AROUND -- MY RECOLLECTION IS ABOUT 2 
20:07:19 1/2 TIMES AS MUCH METRIC TONS OF CO2 AS COMPARED TO THIS PROJECT.

20:07:21 SO AROUND 5,000 VERSUS 13,000.

20:07:29 REBECCA AULD CAN CLARIFY IF SHE HAS PRECISE NUMBERS.

20:07:31 >> Councilmember Jones: THAT ACTUALLY IS WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR, THE 
20:07:35 DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT WAS ORIGINALLY PROPOSED BACK IN 2007 AND WHAT'S BEING 
20:07:36 PROPOSED TODAY.

20:07:40 AND IF IT'S SIGNIFICANTLY LESS, YOU KNOW, THAT'S OBVIOUSLY A PLUS.

20:07:42 SO THANK YOU FOR THE  INFORMATION.

20:07:46 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

20:07:49 ARE THERE CLARIFYING QUESTIONS FROM ANY OTHER COUNCILMEMBERS?

20:07:52 I SEE COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN ALSO HAS HER HAND RAISED.

20:07:54 >> Councilmember Kassan: ONE MORE CLARIFYING QUESTION.

20:07:55 >> Mayor Mei: SURE.

20:07:58 >> Councilmember Kassan: I UNDERSTAND THE ORIGINAL EIR WHICH WAS DONE IN 
20:08:06 2006 OR SO WAS FOR THE FULL PROJECT AS IF IT WAS FULLY BUILT OUT AND FULLY 
20:08:11 USED, YOU KNOW, FULLY OCCUPIED, AND THAT REALLY NEVER WAS THE CASE.

20:08:18 SO I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU'RE COMPARING THE POTENTIAL IMPACTS OF THIS PROJECT 
20:08:25 TO THE  FULLY-BUILT-OUT PROJECT BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT HAPPENED.

20:08:30 IS THERE ANY REPORT THAT SHOWS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE IMPACT OF THE 
20:08:33 ACTUAL GLOBE PROJECT AS IT CURRENTLY EXISTS OR AS IT HAS EXISTED IN THE 
20:08:38 LAST FEW YEARS VERSUS THIS PROJECT -- IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE ACTUAL GLOBE 
20:08:43 PROJECT MUST GENERATE MUCH LESS IN TERMS OF VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED, 
20:08:48 TRIPS, GREENHOUSE GASES, YOU KNOW, AIR QUALITY ISSUES.

20:08:53 WAS THAT LOOKED AT AT ALL OR DID YOU JUST LOOK AT THE COMPARISON TO THE 
20:08:56 INITIAL EIR, WHICH WAS BASED ON THE FULL PROJECT BEING BUILT AND 
20:08:58 SUCCESSFUL?

20:09:06 >> Planner Pullen: WELL, THE ANALYSIS DONE UNDER CEQA COMPARES TO THE 
20:09:09 PROJECT THAT WAS APPROVED AT THE SITE PREVIOUSLY.

20:09:16 SO IF YOU WANTED TO HYPOTHETICALLY EVALUATE WHAT WOULD BE DIFFERENT FROM 
20:09:20 WHAT'S THERE NOW, OR WHAT WAS THERE AT SOME POINT DURING THE LAST FEW YEARS, 
20:09:28 YOU WOULD JUST TAKE THE NUMBER FROM THE ENVIRONMENTAL DOCUMENT THAT DIDN'T 
20:09:31 INCLUDE THE BASELINE CEQA APPROVAL, BUT WHEN YOU REVIEW A PROJECT, THAT'S 
20:09:36 STANDARD PROCEDURE AND THAT'S THE WAY YOU ANALYZE WHAT WE WOULD BE APPROVING 
20:09:39 COMPARED TO WHAT WE PREVIOUSLY APPROVED.

20:09:39 >> Councilmember Kassan: RIGHT.

20:09:44 I JUST THINK IT WOULD BE HELPFUL BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH THE IMPACTS ARE 
20:09:48 LESS THAN WHAT WAS THEORETICALLY GOING TO HAPPEN, IF THE IMPACTS END UP BEING 
20:09:51 MORE THAN WHAT IS ACTUALLY HAPPENING, IT WILL BE GOOD TO KNOW THAT, BECAUSE 
20:09:57 WE DON'T WANT TO GET -- WE DON'T WANT THINGS TO BE WORSE IN TERMS OF AIR 
20:09:59 QUALITY, GREENHOUSE GASES, TRAFFIC, ET CETERA.

20:10:05 BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE WE HAVEN'T LOOKED AT THE DATA OF THE ACTUAL IMPACTS OF THE 
20:10:06 PROJECT AS IS.

20:10:12 >> THIS IS REBECCA AULD AGAIN.

20:10:15 THERE IS A HISTORY OF ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS AT THE SITE AND ORIGINALLY 
20:10:19 THE SITE WAS ZONED FOR INDUSTRIAL TYPES OF USES SUCH AS WOULD HAVE ALLOWED 
20:10:21 WAREHOUSE USES.

20:10:31 THAT ANALYSIS LOOKED AT, WELL, WHAT IF IT IS WAREHOUSE USES AS A BASELINE, 
20:10:32 VERSUS WHAT IF WE CHANGE TO RETAIL?

20:10:36 SO NOW WE'RE LOOKING AT, OKAY, WHAT IF WE GO BACK TO THE INDUSTRIAL TYPES OF 
20:10:40 USES, AS IF WE DIDN'T CHANGE TO RETAIL?

20:10:44 SO IN SOME RESPECTS, THAT ANALYSIS HAS BEEN DONE IN THE REVERSE.

20:10:49 SO IT WAS LOOKED AT, OKAY, WE'RE CHANGING FROM INDUSTRIAL TO RETAIL, 
20:10:52 NOW, NO, WE'RE NOT, WE'RE GOING TO SAY LET'S NOT DO THAT, LET'S GO BACK TO 
20:10:53 THE RETAIL AGAIN.

20:11:01 AS FAR AS WHAT'S THERE NOW, IT'S VACANT, SO WITH THE CHANGE TO THE 
20:11:05 RETAIL, THE SITE WAS NOT SUCCESSFUL.

20:11:10 SO IN THOSE CASES WHERE YOU HAVE A SITE THAT DOESN'T CURRENTLY HAVE A USE ON 
20:11:17 IT, YOU CAN LOG OUT WHAT WOULD BE ALLOWED TO BE THERE IF SOMETHING WAS 
20:11:22 DEVELOPED, SO IN THAT CASE, IT WAS WHAT WAS APPROVED UNDER THE GLOBE.

20:11:23 >> Councilmember Kassan: THANK YOU.

20:11:24 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

20:11:27 I SEE A CLARIFYING QUESTION FROM COUNCILMEMBER JONES.

20:11:29 YOU'VE RAISED YOUR HAND AGAIN.

20:11:34 >> Councilmember Jones: ACTUALLY IT'S STILL UP FROM LAST TIME.

20:11:35 I'LL PUT IT DOWN.

20:11:36 >> Mayor Mei: OKAY, THAT'S FINE.

20:11:37 THANK YOU.

20:11:40 COUNCILMEMBER COX, CLARIFYING QUESTIONS REGARDING THE PRESENTATION SO FAR?

20:11:43 WE STILL HAVE A PRESENTATION TO FOLLOW FROM THE APPLICANT.

20:11:46 >> Councilmember Cox: ABSOLUTELY .

20:11:54 I HAD ONE QUESTION AND I'M NOT SURE -- I DIDN'T REALLY SEE IT SPECIFIED IN 
20:12:02 THE PAPERWORK, BUT WHEN WE LOOK AT THIS PROJECT, GIVEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES NOW 
20:12:07 BETWEEN PRIVATE AND PUBLIC ORGANIZATIONS, THERE SHOULD BE A 
20:12:15 CONSIDERATION OF A HYBRID WORKING MODEL, WHETHER PEOPLE ARE TELEWORKING 
20:12:21 SOME OF THE DAYS VERSUS IN THE OFFICE EVERY DAY, AND NATURALLY THAT WOULD BE 
20:12:30 CONSIDERED ULTIMATELY WOULD BE LESS IF THAT TYPE OF MODEL IS ADOPTED DURING 
20:12:36 THIS TIME AND GOING FORWARD, WOULD THAT BE SOMETHING THAT THE CONSULTANT OR 
20:12:43 OTHER MEMBERS OF OUR CITY STAFF WOULD BE SOMETHING, OR REBECCA, WOULD BE 
20:12:47 ABLE TO AGREE THAT THERE WOULD BE A CHANGE THAT WOULD DEFINITELY YIELD TO 
20:12:55 SOMETHING MORE IF YOU HAD A HYBRID TELEWORKING/PART-TIME NOT EVERYBODY'S 
20:12:57 IN THE OFFICE EVERY DAY?

20:13:02 YOU'RE GENERATING, I THINK 650 FULL TIME JOBS, BUT NOT EVERYBODY IS GOING 
20:13:07 TO BE IN THERE AT THE SAME TIMEMENT SO I'M JUST KIND OF GETTING AN OVERALL 
20:13:14 LOOK AT THAT WOULD BE AGREEABLE THAT IT WOULD BE LESS ON THE IMPACT, AIR 
20:13:20 QUALITY AS WELL AS LOWER TRAFFIC-TYPE MEASUREMENT VMT?

20:13:21 >> I THINK THAT'S GENERALLY TRUE.

20:13:28 THAT BEING SAID, THE TYPE OF USE ISN'T ALWAYS CONDUCIVE TO HAVING WORKERS 
20:13:29 WORK FROM HOME.

20:13:34 AND THESE PARTICULAR TYPES OF USES THAT ARE PROPOSED AT THE SITE ARE NOT ONES 
20:13:38 THAT GENERALLY HAVE A HIGH WORK-FROM-HOME PERCENTAGE.

20:13:43 >> I WOULD ADD THAT WE WOULD CONSIDER MOST OF THE TYPES OF USES THAT WOULD 
20:13:50 LOCATE TO THIS SITE TO BE ESSENTIAL INDUSTRIES, AND SO, YOU KNOW, AS 
20:13:55 REBECCA NOTED, THERE WOULD PROBABLY NOT BE A LOT OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR REMOTE 
20:13:58 WORK THAT'S AVAILABLE.

20:14:03 THERE MIGHT BE, YOU KNOW, SOME KIND OF STAGGERING OF SHIFT DEPENDING ON THE 
20:14:08 TYPE OF OPERATION, SO FOR INSTANCE, IF IT WAS A MANUFACTURING  OPERATION, 
20:14:14 THEY COULD HAVE TWO SHIFT AND THEY MAY NOT NECESSARILY ALIGN WITH THE HOURS 
20:14:17 THAT YOU'RE TYPICALLY SEEING IN RUSH HOUR TRAFFIC.

20:14:22 SO THAT IS VERY COMMON, WE DO SEE THAT AT SOME OF OUR BUSINESSES.

20:14:31 >> CERTAINLY IF I COULD ADD, THERE IS A WAREHOUSE COMPONENT, IT'S NOT ALL JUST 
20:14:31 KIND OF OPEN FLOOR.

20:14:37 SO THERE IS A POTENTIAL FOR FOLKS WHO ARE WORKING IN THE OFFICE COMPONENT TO 
20:14:43 POTENTIALLY HAVE WORK FROM HOME CAPABILITIES THAT PEOPLE IN THE ACTUAL 
20:14:48 MANUFACTURING PORTION OF THE SITE FOR WAREHOUSE MAY NOT HAVE THAT ABILITY.

20:14:52 BUT THERE IS AN OFFICE COMPONENT THAT COULD POTENTIALLY SEE SOME EMPLOYEES 
20:14:52 WORK FROM HOME.

20:14:58 >> Councilmember Cox: THANK YOU.

20:15:02 >> Mayor Mei: COUNCILMEMBER  KENG.

20:15:05 >> Councilmember Keng: SORRY.

20:15:06 THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR.

20:15:11 SO I'M CURIOUS IF YOU COULD REFRESH MY MEMORY, SO THE GLOBE PROJECT 
20:15:17 ORIGINALLY WAS GOING TO COVER THIS AREA THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE, AND IF 
20:15:24 IT WAS GOING TO BE ALL LIKE RETAIL SIMILAR TO THE CURRENT GLOBE SHOPPING CENTER?

20:15:32 >> PREDOMINANTLY, YES, IT WAS ENVISIONED AS KIND OF A  
20:15:35 RETAIL/COMMERCIAL -- PERSONAL SERVICE-TYPE COMPLEX.

20:15:38 RESTAURANTS AS WELL.

20:15:43 THERE WAS A COMPONENT THAT'S FOR PERSONAL STORAGE, SO THERE WAS A 
20:15:48 PERSONAL STORAGE FACILITY AS PART OF THE PRELIMINARY PRECISE PLANNED 
20:15:51 DISTRICT APPROVAL.

20:15:55 THAT STORAGE FACILITY, I CAN GET THAT EXACT SQUARE FOOTAGE, BUT THAT WOULD 
20:16:00 BE THE ONE COMPONENT THAT WAS NOT IN LINE WITH SORT OF RESTAURANT, PERSONAL 
20:16:01 SERVICE AND RETAIL USES.

20:16:03 >> Councilmember Keng: I SEE, THANK YOU.

20:16:08 SO WHAT WAS THE REASON THAT THE REST OF THE SITE WAS NOT  DEVELOPED?

20:16:17 >> MAYBE, DONOVAN, YOU CAN ADD ON TO THIS, BUT I THINK IT WAS JUST, YOU 
20:16:21 KNOW, THE SITE HAD LIMITED VISIBILITY BECAUSE IT WAS OFF THE PRIMARY 
20:16:23 STEVENSON BOULEVARD FRONTAGE.

20:16:29 THE RETAIL MARKET, YOU KNOW, IN SOME WAYS DRIED UP BECAUSE OF THE AMAZONS 
20:16:31 AND OTHER E-COMMERCE USERS.

20:16:41 >> YEAH, AND I WOULD JUST ADD TO THAT THAT THE GENERAL ECONOMICS OF NEW 
20:16:46 RETAIL DEVELOPMENTS HAVE BEEN DECLINING PRETTY CONSISTENTLY WITH THE RISE OF 
20:16:53 E-COMMERCE, AND SO THE OVERALL TRENDS HAVE BEEN CLOSING OF SHOPPING CENTERS 
20:17:00 OR CERTAINLY, YOU KNOW, NOT A LOT OF NEW SHOPPING CENTERS BEING BUILT.

20:17:04 THERE WAS AN ANALYSIS PERFORMED BY STRATEGIC ECONOMICS TO LOOK AT THE 
20:17:11 VIABILITY OF RETAIL AT THIS PARTICULAR SITE, AND I DON'T KNOW, DEREK, IF YOU 
20:17:12 HAVE ANYTHING YOU'D LIKE TO ADD  THERE?

20:17:21 >> I THINK THAT WE'VE COVERED A LOT OF THE ISSUES IN THE ANALYSIS BUT 
20:17:26 BASICALLY THERE'S A LOT OF HEADWINDS TO DEVELOPING RETAIL USE IN THIS LOCATION 
20:17:33 RIGHT NOW, BECAUSE OF THE RISE OF E-COMMERCE, GENERAL DECLINE NECESSARY 
20:17:36 TODAY, THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF REINVESTMENT IN WELL POSITIONED RETAIL 
20:17:40 CENTERS SOMETIMES FOR MIXED USES RATHER THAN A TENDENCY TO DEVELOP NEW RETAIL 
20:17:41 CENTERS AS A RESULT OF THAT.

20:17:48 AND THEN THIS SITE ITSELF, YOU KNOW, IT HAS GOOD ACCESS VIA ON RAMPS TO 880, 
20:17:52 BUT IT IS SET BACK A LITTLE BIT FROM STEVENSON BOULEVARD, IT'S A LITTLE 
20:17:56 LESS VISIBLE AND AS WAS MENTIONED IN THE PRESENTATION, IT WOULD NEED TO 
20:18:03 REALLY COMPETE WITH MAJOR NODES OF PACIFIC COMMONS AND NEW PARK MALL 
20:18:07 RATHER THAN KIND OF SERVE AS ITS OWN -- SERVE ITS OWN UNIQUE TRADE AREA THAT'S 
20:18:08 NOT CURRENTLY COVERED BY THOSE CENTERS.

20:18:12 SO THERE'S JUST A LOT OF HEADWINDS FOR RETAIL DEVELOPMENT TO HAPPEN HERE.

20:18:14 >> Councilmember Keng: I SEE.

20:18:19 AND DO YOU HAVE ANY DATA HOW THE GLOBE SHOPPING CENTER IS DOING?

20:18:23 LIKE IS THERE A LOT OF VACANT SPACES OR THINGS LIKE THAT?

20:18:26 HOW MANY STORES THERE?

20:18:32 I KNOW AT LEAST -- RESTAURANTS HAD CLOSED IN THAT SHOPPING CENTER DURING 
20:18:33 THE PANDEMIC, RIGHT?

20:18:37 >> THAT IS CORRECT.

20:18:43 THE RETAIL AT THE GLOBE FRONTAGE ON STEVENSON HAS PERFORMED A LITTLE 
20:18:48 BETTER, MAINLY BECAUSE IT IS FACING THE MAIN ARTERIAL  ROAD.

20:18:55 IT'S ALSO LENDED TO KIND OF MORE FOOD AND BEVERAGE TYPES OF USES, AND THOSE 
20:19:01 HAVE ACTUALLY  PERFORMED MUCH BETTER THAN OTHER TYPES OF RETAIL OVER THE 
20:19:02 LAST DECADE.

20:19:06 THEY'RE OBVIOUSLY NOT AT THREATENED BY E-COMMERCE.

20:19:13 THAT SAID, THERE IS STILL A LOT OF HEADWINDS WITH OPENING UP AND 
20:19:14 MAINTAINING OPERATIONS FOR RESTAURANTS.

20:19:22 WE DO CONTINUE TO SEE CLOSURES THROUGHOUT THE CITY, AND A LOT OF 
20:19:25 RESTAURATEURS HAVE BEEN STRUGGLING TO RECOVER FULLY FROM THE PANDEMIC.

20:19:32 >> Councilmember Keng: OKAY, THANK YOU.

20:19:36 >> COUNCILMEMBER KENG, GOING BACK TO YOUR QUESTION, SO THERE WAS AN 88,000 
20:19:42 SQUARE FOOT PERSONAL STORAGE USE ENVISIONED AS PART OF THE ORIGINAL 
20:19:43 GLOBE PLANNED APPROVALS.

20:19:44 >> Councilmember Keng: I SEE.

20:19:44 ALL RIGHT.

20:19:46 THANKS.

20:19:46 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

20:19:48 AND WE STILL HAVE THE PRESENTATION.

20:19:52 COUNCILMEMBER COX, IS YOUR HAND RAISED FROM BEFORE, PREVIOUSLY?

20:19:55 >> Councilmember Cox: I'LL TAKE IT DOWN.

20:19:55 THANK YOU.

20:19:56 >> Mayor Mei: OKAY, THANK YOU.

20:19:58 I JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY TO MAKE SURE.

20:20:02 SO THEN WE HAVE NOW AT THIS  TIME -- COULD WE START THE  TIMER?

20:20:08 BECAUSE WE HAVE A 10-MINUTE TIME FRAME FOR THE APPLICANT WITH A POWERPOINT 
20:20:08 PRESENTATION.

20:20:09 WELCOME.

20:20:09 >> YES.

20:20:11 THANK YOU.

20:20:14 GOOD EVENING, EVERYONE.

20:20:17 THANK YOU COUNCIL, PUBLIC, STAFF FOR BEING HERE TONIGHT.

20:20:20 LET ME GET THE SLIDE SHOW UP FOR US.

20:20:23 I KNOW WE KIND OF TALKED ABOUT A LOT OF THIS STUFF SO FAR.

20:20:28 LET ME MAKE SURE I'M SHARING MY SCREEN.

20:20:34 IS THAT WORKING?

20:20:36 >> Mayor Mei: YES.

20:20:38 >> OKAY, GREAT.

20:20:47 I'M MAC CARLSEN, PROJECT MANAGER FOR THIS PROJECT IN FREMONT.

20:20:52 ALSO ON THE CALL IS TODD BARRY HILL, MANAGING DIRECTOR.

20:20:56 BEEN WORKING CLOSELY WITH STAFF ON THIS PROJECT FOR OVER TWO YEARS NOW OR 
20:20:57 CLOSE TO TWO YEARS.

20:20:58 PREPARED A LITTLE PRESENTATION HERE.

20:21:01 SOME OF IT'S BEEN COVERED ALREADY SO I'LL TRY TO MAKE IT FAIRLY QUICK AND 
20:21:03 BE OPEN TO QUESTIONS.

20:21:06 TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE GOOD NEWS ON THIS PROJECT, WHICH THERE'S CERTAINLY 
20:21:07 A LOT.

20:21:12 I'M GOING TO TALK QUICKLY ABOUT SCA NSM NELL AS A COMPANY, SOME OF OUR 
20:21:15 REPRESENTATIVE PROJECTS IN AL PLEA DA COUNTY, PROJECT DESIGN, POTENTIAL 
20:21:19 TENANTS AND OUR PUBLIC BENEFITS THAT COME ON THE PROJECT WHICH HAVE BEEN 
20:21:20 TOUCHED ON.

20:21:26 SO THIS IS A 30-YEAR COMPANY, WE'RE BASED IN INDIANAPOLIS, REGIONAL 
20:21:28 OFFICES AROUND THE U.S. AND EUROPE.

20:21:33 WE SPECIALIZE IN INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT SPANNING ALL INDUSTRIAL ASSET TYPES, 
20:21:37 MANUFACTURING, WAREHOUSING, ADVANCED MANUFACTURING, COLD STORAGE, R & D, 
20:21:37 THE WORKS.

20:21:42 HERE'S SOME OF OUR CLIENTS.

20:21:49 WE PRIDE OURSELVES ON BEING KIND OF A VERY STRONG CLIENT-TENANT 
20:21:53 RELATIONSHIP-DRIVEN DEVELOPER, WHICH ALLOWS US TO SERVICE TENANTS ON A 
20:21:55 REPEAT BASIS IN MARKETS AROUND THE U.S.

20:21:59 QUICKLY WANTED TO TALK ABOUT SCANNELL IN THE COMMUNITY.

20:22:07 WE DO HAVE AN ARM CALLED RJS FOUNDATION, STANDS FOR ROBERT J. 
20:22:07 SCANNELL.

20:22:12 MUCH OF THE CHARITABLE SUPPORT FOCUS ON ISSUES RELATED TO FOOD INSECURITY, 
20:22:16 TRANSITIONAL  HOUSING, WOUND SUPPORT RESOURCES AND A BUNCH OF OTHER GOOD 
20:22:16 STUFF.

20:22:26 ONE OF OUR LOCAL PARTNERS, FOOD BANK OF CONTRA COSTA AND SOLANO.

20:22:31 WE'VE HEARD FROM SOME GREAT, GREAT GROUPS, INCLUDING TRI-CITY VOLUNTEERS.

20:22:35 SO I WANTED TO QUICKLY HIGHLIGHT A CASE STUDY OF ANOTHER CASE IN ALAMEDA 
20:22:39 COUNTY WHERE WE'VE HAD A SUCCESSFUL ONGOING PARTNERSHIP.

20:22:44 HERE'S THREE EXAMPLES OF  PROJECTS WE DELIVERED IN THE LAST COUPLE YEARS IN 
20:22:45 LIVERMORE.

20:22:49 THESE ARE ALL SIMILAR SIZES AND USES TO THOSE PROPOSED IN FREEDOM.

20:22:54 AS I HOPE YOU CAN SEE, HIGH QUALITY DESIGN AND FINISHES, AND WE'VE BEEN 
20:23:02 ABLE TO ATTRACT A DIVERSE ARRAY OF TENANTS TO THESE PROJECTS.

20:23:07 TWO OF THESE PROJECTS WERE LEASED TO MANUFACTURING AND ADVANCED 
20:23:07 MANUFACTURING.

20:23:14 ONE DOESN'T YET HAVE A TENANT, BUT IT CAN HOUSE AN ARRAY OF INDUSTRIAL USES, 
20:23:18 AGAIN SIMILAR TO THE FREMONT BUILDINGS, IT COULD BE MANUFACTURING, 
20:23:22 DISTRIBUTION, ANYTHING THAT CAN WORK INSIDE OF AN INDUSTRIAL BUILDING.

20:23:26 NOW TO OUR PROJECT.

20:23:34 SO SITE DESIGN, WE'VE UNDERGONE A TON OF ITERATIONS WITH A BUNCH OF 
20:23:39 COLLABORATION WITH CITY  STAFF, FLEXIBLE INDUSTRIAL BUILDINGS HOUSED 
20:23:41 IN ARRAY OF INDUSTRIAL COMPANIES.

20:23:45 WE EXPECT OCCUPANCY TO BE A MIX OF INDUSTRIAL USES INCLUDING ADVANCED 
20:23:48 MANUFACTURING, TECH, LIFE SCIENCE, R & D AND DISTRIBUTION.

20:23:54 ACCORDING TO THE DATA WE'VE PERCEIVED FROM CITY ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, 75% OF 
20:23:58 THE FREMONT INDUSTRIAL LEASES IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS HAVE BEEN FROM 
20:24:02 ADVANCED INDUSTRIES, THOSE ARE ADVANCED MANUFACTURING, R & D, LIFE SCIENCES, 
20:24:06 TECH, SO WE THINK THAT'S PERFECT FOR THIS PROJECT.

20:24:12 WE HOPE THE FLEXIBILITY IN THE SITE WILL I A LOW FOR SEVERAL DIFFERENT 
20:24:16 USES WITHIN THE SITE ITSELF, KIND OF AN INDUSTRIAL HECOSIS TEM, WHERE 
20:24:21 MANUFACTURERS RECEIVE A PRODUCT, THEY COMPLETE THEIR MANUFACTURING AND THEY 
20:24:26 SHIP THE PROJECT OUT, KIND OF HAVING THAT WHOLE ECOSYSTEM ALL ON SITE HERE.

20:24:32 SOME OF THESE BUILDINGS, ALL THESE BUILDINGS ACTUALLY WOULD ALLOW FOR A 
20:24:35 MANUFACTURER TO DO BOTH THEIR MANUFACTURING AND WAREHOUSING 
20:24:41  OPERATIONS UNDER ONE ROOF RATHER THAN SHIPPING BACK AND FORTH FR AN OFF SITE 
20:24:46 WAREHOUSE, DRIVING TO THE SITE OR EVEN ANOTHER CITY IN THE BAY AREA.

20:24:47 SO WE THINK THAT'S GREAT.

20:24:51 WE DO HAVE INTEREST FROM SEVERAL TENANTS, I MENTIONED THAT EARLIER 
20:24:52 PRIOR TO MY  PRESENTATION.

20:24:59 WE CAN'T REALLY NAME THEM OUT RIGHT FOR CONFIDENTIALITY BUT I WILL SAY AMAZON 
20:25:00 ISN'T ONE OF THEM.

20:25:00 I MENTIONED THAT.

20:25:03 IT DOESN'T WORK FOR THEM, BASED ON THE DENSITY OF THE SITE.

20:25:08 FROM THAT SITE PLAN, THERE'S NO TRUCK PARKING, THERE'S NO VAN PARKING, 
20:25:12 THERE'S NO SPACE FOR DELIVERY FLEET.

20:25:17 SO REALLY IF YOU TRIEF BY AN AMAZON, THE LAST MILE AMAZON, IT'S A SMALL 
20:25:21 BUILDING, BIG SITE, TONS OF PARKING FOR THEIR DELIVERY FLEET, THAT'S NOT WHAT 
20:25:21 WE HAVE HERE.

20:25:28 WE HAVE HEARD THE CONCERN FROM THE PUBLIC AND/OR COUNCIL ON KIND OF THIS 
20:25:32 LAST MILE USE, SO I DID WANT TO SHARE SOME EXAMPLES OF BUSINESSES WHO HAVE 
20:25:36 REACHED OUT AND ARE INTERESTED IN THE SITE THAT I THINK CAN BE CATEGORIZED 
20:25:43 AS LAST MILE, BUT AGAIN, THEY'RE NOT THIS KIND OF SUPER SCARY HIGH-DENSITY 
20:25:46 USAGE THAT ACTUALLY WAS STUDIED AS STAFF HAD MENTIONED.

20:25:50 HERE'S A FEW EXAMPLES OF A TENANTS THAT HAVE SHOWN INTEREST.

20:25:54 I'M NOT GOING TO NAME NAMES OR IF I DO, IT'S NOT THE SPECIFIC TENANT.

20:25:55 JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THAT.

20:26:00 ONE IS A TESLA PART MANUFACTURER TO VALUE ADD LO JESS TICS TYPE TENANT TO 
20:26:04 WHENEVER MANUFACTURES PARTS -- TESLA.

20:26:10 MAJOR RETAILER WHO DELIVERS BULKIER ITEMS SUCH AS  APPLIANCES, 
20:26:15 REFRIGERATORS, DIRECTLY TO CONSUMERS TO AVOID THEM -- HAVING TO KEEP THEM IN 
20:26:16 THEIR RETAIL LOCATION.

20:26:22 THIRD IS A FOOD DISTRIBUTOR LIKE CISCO, SUPPORT FOR RESTAURANTS AND GROCERY 
20:26:22 STORES.

20:26:25 NOW THERE'S DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER GROCERIES.

20:26:28 I THINK YOU GUYS HAVE SEEN IN THE PANDEMIC A LOT MORE PEOPLE ARE 
20:26:32 ORDERING GROCERIES ONLINE AND LASTLY, WE HAVE HAD INTEREST FROM A 
20:26:37 SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURER, SO SIMILAR TO LAM WHO YOU GUYS ARE VERY FAMILIAR 
20:26:41 WITH IN FREMONT, THEY DELIVER TO COMPANIES LIKE MICRON, SO THAT'S 
20:26:45 ANOTHER KIND OF PART OF THAT ECOSYSTEM.

20:26:51 ALTHOUGH WE HAVE HAD INTEREST FROM THESE COMPANIES, THEY DON'T TYPICALLY 
20:26:56 COMMIT FOR A SITE UNTIL THEY'RE SIX MONTHS OUT FROM IT, SO WE NEED THESE 
20:27:00 AVAILABLE AND FLEXIBLE SO THAT WHEN PROBLEMS COME HERE BECAUSE SPACE IS 
20:27:03 AVAILABLE AND IF IT'S NOT HERE, THEY'LL KIND OF GO TO A NEIGHBORING CITY OR 
20:27:08  NEIGHBORING PROJECT IN MILIPITAS OR NEWARK.

20:27:14 SO A COUPLE QUICK PICTURE I'LL PUBLIC CLICK THROUGH, PRESENT, FUTURE.

20:27:20 SO COMMUNITY BENEFIT, AGAIN, A LOT OF THIS HAS BEEN TOUCHED ON BY STAFF, 
20:27:27 THANKS DONOVAN FOR TALKING THROUGH THIS STUFF, BUT AGAIN, EXPECTING 350 TO 400 
20:27:27 CONSTRUCTION JOBS.

20:27:32 I WILL GET TO THIS PART LATER IN THE SLIDES BUT THOSE ARE GOING TO BE UNION 
20:27:34 JOBS, HIGH PAYING UNION JOBS.

20:27:42 AND THEN 300 TO 650 JOBS, STRATEGIC ECONOMICS CERTAINLY THINKS THAT 650 IS 
20:27:44 A BETTER, ACCURATE NUMBER.

20:28:00 FEES, WE HAVE $5.5 MILLION IN FEES SUCH AS U SACRAMENTO D,  ACWD, IT A LOT, 
20:28:02 IT'S A BIG INVESTMENT.

20:28:04 TAX BENEFITS WERE TOUCH ON.

20:28:10 300 -- 3 MILLION OVER THE NEXT 10 YEARS.

20:28:15 ALSO TO SUPPORT THE NEIGHBORING RETAIL WHO WE TALKED ABOUT, THEY NEED THE 
20:28:18 SUPPORT, THEY'RE  EXCITED ABOUT THIS PROJECT, AND POTENTIALLY HAVING 650 
20:28:19 NEW PATRONS.

20:28:25 TRAFFIC IMPROVEMENTS, WE TALKED ABOUT INSTALLING TWO NEW SIGNALS AND THEN 
20:28:29 SOLAR READY, SO INITIALLY WE HAD DESIGNED IT, THE ROOF TO BE READY FOR 
20:28:36 SOLAR SO WHEN A TENANT COMES IN, WE CAN INSTALL SOLAR BASED ON THEIR NEEDS.

20:28:40 WE'VE HEARD ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS AND WHAT WE WANT TO OFFER TONIGHT IS OUR 
20:28:47 VOLUNTARY MANDATORY REEF TOP SOLAR SO THAT WE CAN'T -- YOU KNOW, REGARDLESS 
20:28:53 OF WHAT KIND OF -- SCANNELL IS COMMITTED TO DOING OUR PART AND 
20:28:55 PUTTING IN THAT SOLAR FOR OUR TENANTS.

20:29:00 AGAIN, WE TOUCHED ON AN ADDITIONAL COMMUNITY BENEFIT IN CONSULTATION WITH 
20:29:08 CITY STAFF, COMMUNITY BENEFIT AIMED AT FIGHTING HOUSING INSECURITY.

20:29:12 RATHER THAN WAIT UNTIL THE END OF THE PROJECT, WE AGREED TO COMMIT TO THAT 
20:29:13 BENEFIT AT OUR FIRST BUILDING PERMIT.

20:29:16 SO CITY IS GOING TO GET IT SOONER THAN LATER.

20:29:20 UNION PARTNERSHIP.

20:29:25 AS PART OF OUR OUTREACH WE ARE WORKING WITH LABOR UNIONS INCLUDING 
20:29:29 CARPENTERS, P HS AND LABOR TRADES.

20:29:35 THESE INVESTMENTS ACCOUNT FOR 14% OF OUR TOTAL CONSTRUCTION COST, SO IT'S A 
20:29:39 BIG -- TO MAKE SURE WE GET HIGH PAYING UNION JOBS.

20:29:45 AS ANOTHER PART, WE AGREE TO COMMIT TO LOCAL APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS WHICH 
20:29:45 WE'RE REALLY PROUD.

20:29:50 I THINK SOME OF OF THOSE FOLKS HERE ARE GOING TO SPEAK IN FAVOR OF THE 
20:29:50 PROJECT.

20:29:52 SO JUST TO CONCLUDE, THANKS, EVERYONE.

20:29:56 I REALLY APPRECIATE STAFF'S HARD WORK ON THIS, AND COUNCIL, I THINK THAT 
20:30:01 THIS IS A RIGHT USE IN THE RIGHT LOCATION, AND IT'S GOING TO HAVE A TON 
20:30:05 OF BENEFITS TO THE WORKFORCE, SURROUNDING COMMUNITY, AND REALLY 
20:30:06 PROUD OF THE PROJECT REPRESENTING.

20:30:06 THANK YOU.

20:30:14 >> Mayor Mei: GREAT.

20:30:16 THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE PRESENTATION.

20:30:22 I SEE THAT WE HAVE CLARIFYING QUESTIONS FROM THE  COUNCILMEMBERS AND WE'RE 
20:30:23 GOING TO OPEN UP FOR PUBLIC HEARING.

20:30:27 CLARIFYING QUESTIONS, VICE MAYOR SALWAN.

20:30:32 >> Vice Mayor Salwan: THANK YOU FOR CLARIFYING SOME OF THE POTENTIAL USES.

20:30:38 THAT HELPS ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT WERE RAISED EARLIER.

20:30:44 AND JUST TO BE CLEAR, YOU ARE AMENABLE TO ADDING A CONDITION TO GO FULLY 
20:30:48 SOLAR WITH THE APPROVAL OF THIS PROJECT.

20:30:51 IS THAT SOMETHING YOU VOLUNTARILY WOULD AGREE TO AS PART OF THE CONDITION?

20:30:53 >> YES, YES.

20:30:54 >> Vice Mayor Salwan: OKAY, GREAT.

20:30:56 THANK YOU.

20:31:03 >> Mayor Mei: CLARIFYING QUESTIONS, COUNCILMEMBER KENG.

20:31:05 >> Councilmember Keng: THANK  YOU, MADAME MAYOR.

20:31:13 SO ALSO, I TOLD THAT IT  CLARIFIES THAT AMAZON IS NOT ONE OF THE POTENTIAL 
20:31:19 TENANTS, BUT DO YOU HAVE ANY DATA AS FAR AS, YOU KNOW, HOW MUCH TRAFFIC, 
20:31:25 HAVING THESE DIFFERENT TENANTS THAT JUST -- APPLIANCE DISTRIBUTION OR FOOD 
20:31:32 DISTRIBUTION, SEMICONDUCTOR, WAREHOUSE, LIKE, COMPARING TO SAY AMAZON, YOU 
20:31:41 KNOW, WHAT WOULD BE THE DIFFERENCE IN LIKE TRUCKS, DELIVERIES PER DAY, FOR 
20:31:47 EXAMPLE, SO THAT -- BECAUSE WE'RE SEEING SOME OF THESE REPORTS REGARDING 
20:31:53 THESE LAST MILE DELIVERY FACILITIES CREATING A LOT OF AIR POLLUTION AND WE 
20:31:57 DEFINITELY WILL BE HAVING SOME CONCERNS IF THAT'S WHAT'S COMING INTO THE 
20:32:04 NEIGHBORHOOD, BUT SO IF YOU HAVE ANY DATA IN THAT REGARDS.

20:32:08 >> SURE.

20:32:12 SO LIKE I SAID, WE DON'T HAVE ANY TENANT COMMITMENTS AT THIS POINT.

20:32:20 IT WOULD TAKE US A LOT FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD THERE TO ACTUALLY GET TRAFFIC 
20:32:22 DATA FROM THEM THAT WE COULD SHARE WITH THE CITY.

20:32:29 I DO THINK PERHAPS THE CEQA CONSULTANT CAN TALK ABOUT WHAT WE STUDIED, MOST 
20:32:33 INTENSE USE AND KIND OF WHAT A MIDDLE GROUND MAY BE FOR SOME DELIVERY USE, 
20:32:39 SOME MANUFACTURING USE, BUT I DON'T HAVE THAT DATA AVAILABLE BECAUSE WE 
20:32:40 DON'T KNOW THE TENANTS YET.

20:32:44 >> Councilmember Keng: I SEE, ALL RIGHT, THANKS.

20:32:46 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

20:32:52 CLARIFYING QUESTIONS, COUNCILMEMBER COX, AND THEN I THINK WE HAVE PUBLIC 
20:32:53 HEARING STILL.

20:32:54 >> Councilmember Cox: THANK YOU.

20:32:57 THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION.

20:32:59 FOR EVERYONE'S PRESENTATIONS.

20:33:01 IT'S BEEN VERY HELPFUL.

20:33:07 RIGHT NOW I'M GOING TO ASK MARK A QUESTION IN REGARDS TO I KNOW THAT -- 
20:33:12 I'M HAPPY TO LEARN THAT YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE THE COMMITMENT FOR SOLAR.

20:33:16 ARE YOU ALSO GOING TO HAVE CHARGING STATIONS AND THOSE TYPES OF THINGS 
20:33:19 AVAILABLE AT YOUR FACILITY?

20:33:29 >> YEAH, SO THERE IS A REQUIREMENT THAT EV CHARGES BE INSTALLED FOR A CERTAIN 
20:33:31 PERCENTAGE OF THE ON SITE PARKING STALLS.

20:33:36 I BELIEVE IT'S 10% AND THE TOTAL OF EV PARKING WITH CHARGERS UPON BUILDOUT 
20:33:39 WOULD BE -- I THINK IT'S 72 OR 73 STALLS.

20:33:44 >> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.

20:33:45 GREAT.

20:33:45 THANK YOU.

20:33:53 >> Mayor Mei: COUNCILMEMBER  SHAO, CLARIFYING QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME?

20:33:55 >> Councilmember Shao: THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION.

20:33:55 VERY QUICK QUESTION.

20:34:02 WITHOUT ANY TENANT COMMITMENT, WOULD YOU COME UP WITH THE NUMBER OF LOCAL 
20:34:05 JOBS BEING CREATED AND AT CERTAIN LEVELS?

20:34:06 >> SURE.

20:34:12 I THINK THAT QUESTION CAN PROBABLY BE TAKEN BY DEREK, IF HE'S STILL ON.

20:34:14 I CAN TRY TO ADDRESS IT.

20:34:17 I THINK THAT THEY HAVE METRICS THAT THEY LOOK AT BASED ON DIFFERENT TYPES 
20:34:22 OF INDUSTRIAL USERS, BUT DEREK IS THE EXPERT SO WHY DON'T YOU TAKE IT AWAY.

20:34:22 >> SURE.

20:34:27 YES, SO WE DID HAVE TO MAKE SOME ASSUMPTIONS IN ORDER TO MODEL THOSE 
20:34:36 JOB NUMBERS, AND WE BASICALLY ASSUMED THAT ONE BUILDING'S MANUFACTURING USE, 
20:34:43 ONE BUILDING WAREHOUSE, ONE IS  R & D AN THEN WE USE SORT OF AVERAGE SQUARE 
20:34:44 FOOT TO DEVELOP THAT NUMBER.

20:34:48 SO IN REALITY, EVERY TENANT IS GOING TO HAVE A DIFFERENT PROFILE IN TERMS OF 
20:34:55 NUMBER OF JOBS SO THAT COULD DEPEND ON ULTIMATELY WHO OCCUPIES THE SPACE AND 
20:34:56 WHAT THEIR NEEDS ARE.

20:34:59 >> Councilmember Shao: THANK  YOU.

20:35:01 >> YOU'RE WELCOME.

20:35:02 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

20:35:07 AND I DON'T SEE CLARIFYING QUESTIONS FROM ANY OF THE COUNCILMEMBERS AT THIS 
20:35:07 TIME.

20:35:09 I'M GOING TO OPEN UP THE PUBLIC HEARING.

20:35:14 AND IF MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WISHING TO SPEAK AT THIS TIME, MAY DO SO BY 
20:35:18 PRESSING THE RAISE HAND ICON OR IF YOU'RE DIALING IN BY PHONE, BY 
20:35:20 PRESSING  STAR NINE.

20:35:23 AND BECAUSE WE STILL HAVE A PRETTY FULL AGENDA, I'D LIKE TO KEEP TO 2 MINUTES 
20:35:24 AT THE MOST IF POSSIBLE.

20:35:26 FOR THIS.

20:35:28 >> Ms. Gauthier: WE CAN KEEP IT AT 2 MINUTES.

20:35:32 IT LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE ABOUT 7, 8 SPEAKERS.

20:35:37 THE FIRST IS TIM LIPSCOMB.

20:35:38 >> Mayor Mei: WELCOME, TIM.

20:35:39 >> THANK YOU.

20:35:45 GOOD EVENING, MAYOR, COUNCILMEMBERS, STAFF, SCANNELL PROPERTIES AND MEMBERS 
20:35:45 OF THE PUBLIC.

20:35:53 MY NAME IS TIM, I'M A 60-YEAR RESIDENT OF FREMONT, OHLONE GRADUATE AND 
20:35:54 RETIRED CARPENTER.

20:36:01 MOSTLY PROUD OF BEING A ROLE WHERE I'M PROUD TO SERVE.

20:36:08 I'M ASKING FOR A YES VOTE TONIGHT ON THE ALBRAE PROJECT BECAUSE STANNELL -- 
20:36:09 IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF THIS PROJECT.

20:36:12 THAT MEANS GOOD HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD JOBS WITH HEALTHCARE BENEFITS FOR THE WHOLE 
20:36:12 FAMILY.

20:36:19 ADDITIONALLY, IT WILL CREATE APPRENTICESHIP OPPORTUNITIES FOR 
20:36:22 CONSTRUCTION GRADUATES THIS YEAR FROM MISSION VALLEY ROP.

20:36:27 NOW THIS GETS ME EXCITED BECAUSE IN 1989, I BOUGHT MY FIRST HOUSE IN 
20:36:30  CABRILLO PARK AS A THIRD YEAR APPRENTICE.

20:36:33 A POSSIBILITY WE SHOULD DEFINITELY KEEP ALIVE IN  FREMONT.

20:36:36 I HOPE THAT THE COUNCIL WILL CONTINUE TO REQUIRE OTHER PROJECTS IN FREMONT 
20:36:40 TO MAKE THE SAME COMMITMENTS AS SCANNELL PROPERTIES HAS TONIGHT.

20:36:44 IF WE ARE REALLY PRO ENVIRONMENT, THEN WE WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THESE 
20:36:48 KINDS OF PROJECTS THAT KEEP OUR LOCAL CONSTRUCTION WORKERS WORKING HERE IN 
20:36:49 FREMONT.

20:36:54 AND OUR APPRENTICES ALSO AND KEEPING THEM OFF THE FREEWAYS, WHERE THEY'RE 
20:36:56 NOT PRODUCING GREENHOUSE GASES.

20:37:00 MORE AND MORE CITIES ARE COMING TO THE REALIZATION THAT THIS IS A WIN-WIN FOR 
20:37:04 THE CITIES AND FOR THEIR LOCAL CONSTRUCTION WORKERS AND APAREN TASS.

20:37:12 THIS ALSO HELPS CREATE SKILLED CRAFTS PERSONS TO HELP REBUILD OUR CRUMBLING 
20:37:13 INFRASTRUCTURES.

20:37:17 IT ALSO TURNS THE TIDE ON OUR SHORTAGE OF CONSTRUCTION WORKERS IN THE UNITED 
20:37:17 STATES.

20:37:21 AGAIN, I'M URGING A YES VOTE ON THIS PROJECT TONIGHT TO CREATE REAL 
20:37:26 OPPORTUNITIES FOR OUR LOCAL FREMONT CONSTRUCTION WORKERS, WHICH WILL 
20:37:30 REDUCE TRAFFIC ON OUR FREEWAYS AND CUT DOWN ON THE OVERALL GREENHOUSE GASES 
20:37:31  THROUGHOUT THE BAY AREA.

20:37:32 THANK YOU.

20:37:34 >> Ms. Gauthier: THANK YOU.

20:37:35 NEXT SPEAKER IS BRIAN WERNER.

20:37:42 >> GOOD EVENING, COUNCIL, COUNCIL MEMBERS.

20:37:43 APPRECIATE IT.

20:37:44 MY NAME IS BRIAN WERNER.

20:37:49 I AM PART OF THE MEPS, I'M HERE REPRESENTING TONIGHT THE FIVE LOCAL 
20:38:00 UNION TRADES:   ELECTRICIAN, SHEET MET TALL WORKERS, IRONWORKERS, URGE YOU TO 
20:38:03 -- THE PROJECT CREATES IS SECOND TO NONE.

20:38:07 WE'RE GOING TO HAVE GOOD LOCAL UNION PAYING JOBS, WE'RE GOING TO HAVE FOLKS 
20:38:10 FROM THE LOCAL COMMUNITY WORKING THERE THAT ARE GOING TO RECEIVE HEALTH 
20:38:11  BENEFITS.

20:38:15 ALONG WITH RETIREMENT BENEFITS, AND AT THE END OF THE DAY, THAT'S AN 
20:38:20 INVESTMENT ON THE COMMUNITY WHERE FOLKS CAN AFFORD TO LIVE WHERE THEY ARE 
20:38:21 WORKING.

20:38:24 WITH THAT, I URGE YOU GUYS TO APPROVE THIS.

20:38:30 THIS IS GREAT BENEFIT FOR THE COMMUNITY, THE DEVELOPER HAS AGREED TO 
20:38:37 PAY, I BELIEVE, ADEQUATE FEES, THE RETURN ON INVESTMENT ON THIS IS HUGE, 
20:38:40 REINVESTING TAX DOLLARS BACK INTO THE COMMUNITY, URGE YOU TO VOTE YES ON 
20:38:40 THIS PROJECT.

20:38:45 >> Ms. Gauthier: THANK YOU.

20:38:47 NEXT SPEAKER IS KELLY ABREU.

20:38:49 >> THANK YOU.

20:38:56 JUST TO PUT THIS PROJECT A LITTLE BIT IN CONTEXT, FROM WHAT I'VE SEEN, HE 
20:39:01 WAS SHOWING PICTURES OF SOME WAREHOUSES IN LIVERMORE.

20:39:04 LIVERMORE HAS VERY VOCAL SOLAR PROPONENTS.

20:39:09 PEOPLE THERE WANT SOLAR ROOFTOPS AND THEY DON'T WANT INDUSTRIAL SOLAR.

20:39:14 IN FREMONT, WE'VE GOT A LOT OF BIG BOX RETAILERS NEARBY THIS PROJECT, LIKE 
20:39:18 WAL-MART ACROSS THE STREET, LIKE TARGET, LIKE COSTCO, ALL OF THEM GOT 
20:39:20 SOLAR ON THEIR ROOFTOPS.

20:39:25 BUT IF YOU LOOK AROUND THIS NEIGHBORHOOD, LOOK AT FREMONT, THESE 
20:39:31 GIANT BIG BOX WAREHOUSES, THE OTHER 6,000 ACRES, YOU DON'T SEE -- A LOT OF 
20:39:35 THEM -- THIS COUNCIL JUST RECENTLY APPROVED A LOT OF THESE INDUSTRIAL 
20:39:36 WAREHOUSES NEARBY.

20:39:38 YOU DON'T SEE ANY SOLAR ON THEIR ROOFS AT ALL.

20:39:46 SO FOR THEM TO COMMIT TO SOLAR IS SOMETHING -- THAT PUTS THEM A STEP 
20:39:51 AHEAD OF ALL THE OTHER INDUSTRIAL WAREHOUSES THAT THE CITY HAS BEEN 
20:39:51 APPROVING.

20:39:55 THE CITY DOES HAVE CONTROL OVER STREET PARKING DIRECTLY.

20:39:56 VERY DIRECTLY.

20:40:00 YOU SEND OUT YOUR PARKING ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS TO HAND OUT PARKING TICKETS 
20:40:04 EVERYWHERE, MAYBE NOT EVERYWHERE, BUT NEARBY INDUSTRIAL AREAS.

20:40:07 THE OTHER 6,000 ACRES, THEY DON'T HAVE ANY CURB PARKING.

20:40:09 IT'S ONE BIG NO-PARKING ZONE.

20:40:13 AND YOU KNOW, IN SOME AREAS.

20:40:18 AND THEN IN OTHER AREAS LIKE ON CHRISTY OR ALBRAE OR WHEREVER, YOU GET RVs AND 
20:40:22 JUNK CARS CLOGGING ALL THE STREETS IN THE INDUSTRIAL ZONES, AND IT'S 
20:40:25 SYMPTOMATIC OF THE HOMELESS CRISIS OBVIOUSLY.

20:40:27 CITY NEEDS REASONABLE PARKING REG LAYINGS.

20:40:34 PEOPLE NEED TO BE ABLE TO PARK ON THE CURBS, ON THE STREETS, AND NOT CREATE 
20:40:36 A HOMELESS CRISIS EVERYWHERE.

20:40:40 THERE HAS TO BE A BALANCE, AND THE CITY HASN'T FOUND IT.

20:40:45 IT'S EITHER A NO PARKING ZONE OR A MESS, A JUNKYARD.

20:40:46 THANK YOU.

20:40:51 >> Ms. Gauthier: THANK YOU, NEXT SPEAKER IS JACOB KLEIN.

20:40:52 >> HI.

20:40:54 MY NAME IS JACOB KLEIN.

20:40:58 I'M AN ORGANIZER FOR THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY CHAPTER OF THE SIERRA CLUB.

20:41:02 THANK YOU TO THE MAYOR, THE CITY COUNCILMEMBERS, THE STAFF FOR THE 
20:41:03 OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ON THIS TOPIC.

20:41:08 PREVIOUSLY, THE SIERRA CLUB SENT A LETTER TO THE PLANNING COMMISSION 
20:41:09 LODGING OPPOSITION TO THIS ITEM.

20:41:13 I'M WITHDRAWING SIERRA CLUB'S OPPOSITION TO THIS PROJECT.

20:41:22 I APPRECIATE SCANNELL'S COMMITMENT TO FULL ROOFTOP SOLAR AND A[INAUDIBLE] 
20:41:23 DELIVERY STATIONS.

20:41:27 HOWEVER I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT AREAS OF CONCERN FOR THE CITY OF FREMONT TO 
20:41:30 TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION FOR FUTURE WAREHOUSE DEVELOPMENTS.

20:41:39  -- OUTSIZED ENVIRONMENTAL, PUBLIC HEALTH AND QUALITY OF LIFE IMPACTS ON 
20:41:40 NEIGHBORING RESIDENTS.

20:41:46 THE HIGH LEVEL OF TRAFFIC FROM TRUCKS AND VANS AT THE SITE AND OPERATED BY 
20:41:50 THIRD PARTY CARRIERS CAN LEAD TO INCREASED DIESEL EMISSIONS AND OTHER 
20:41:54 EMISSIONS WHICH NEGATIVELY IMPACTS PUBLIC HEALTH, PARTICULAR LISTENSTIVE 
20:41:58 RECEPTORS AND OVERBURDENED POPULATIONS WHICH ARE OFTEN CLOSEST TO INDUSTRIAL 
20:42:04  SITES DUE TO THE HISTORY OF ZONING.

20:42:10 IT ALSO WEARS DOWN PUBLIC ROADS AND INCREASES COMMUTE TIMES.

20:42:17 WE RECOMMEND -- RATHER THAN RELY ON ONES FROM 15 YEARS PRIOR, BUT THE 
20:42:20 APPROPRIATE MITIGATION MEASURES INCLUDING ELECTRIFICATION AND ROBUST 
20:42:22 COMMUNITY INVESTMENTS CAN BE DEVELOPED.

20:42:26 WE ALSO RECOMMEND UPDATING FREMONT'S MUNICIPAL CODE TO  BETTER ADDRESS THE 
20:42:30 GROWING NUMBER OF HEAVY DISTRIBUTION CENTERS AS OTHER CITIES IN THE BAY 
20:42:31 AREA HAVE DONE OR ARE CONSIDERING.

20:42:36 AS WAS MENTIONED TONIGHT, E-COMMERCE IS GROWING, AND  CITIES CAN AND SHOULD BE 
20:42:41 READY TO RESPOND IN ORDER TO PROTECT COMMUNITY HEALTH AND CREATE PERMANENT, 
20:42:42 GOOT PAYING JOBS.

20:42:43 THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TODAY.

20:42:45 >> Ms. Gauthier: THANK YOU.

20:42:52 THE NEXT SPEAKER IS MARTHA  KREEGER.

20:42:56 >> THANK YOU SO MUCH, SUSAN, THE CITY OF FREMONT COUNCILMEMBERS AND EVERYONE 
20:42:56 ELSE.

20:42:57 CAN YOU HEAR ME?

20:43:00 >> Ms. Gauthier: YOU'RE VERY  LOW, IF YOU CAN SPEAK UP OR MOVE CLOSER TO 
20:43:02  YOUR MICROPHONE, PLEASE.

20:43:03 >> IS THIS BETTER?

20:43:03 ?

20:43:04 >> YES.

20:43:06 >> THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TELLING ME.

20:43:14 MY NAME A MARTHA KREEGER, I RAISED MY CHILDREN HERE AND I'M ALSO A MEMBER OF 
20:43:15 THE SIERRA  CLUB.

20:43:23 I REALLY LIKE TO SAY YOU REALLY HAVE TAKEN THIS SERIOUSLY, APPRECIATE THE 
20:43:29 COUNCILMEMBERS, ESPECIALLY JENNY KASSAN, TERESA KENG, RAJ SALWAN AND 
20:43:33 EVERYONE ELSE FOR SPEAKING UP SO STRONGLY PORE ONGOING GOOD JOBS, 
20:43:37 ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS AND COMMUTE TIMES BEING LOWER, ESPECIALLY AS WE 
20:43:38 RECOVER FROM THE PANDEMIC.

20:43:45 I ALSO REALLY WANT TO THANK FREMONT AND HOPE THAT YOU REALLY KEEP UP WITH THE 
20:43:49 LAST MILE DELIVERY STATIONS NOT BEING ALLOWED HERE, SINCE THEY HAVE SUCH A 
20:43:51 DEEP AND HEAVY ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT BURDEN.

20:43:56 I WOULD LOVE FOR YOU ALSO TO -- I THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR COMMITTING TO UNION 
20:44:00 JOBS, AND I THOAP THAT THOSE JOBS, BECAUSE THEY HAVE SAFE WORKING 
20:44:07 ENVIRONMENTS AND ARE GOOD ONGOING AND PAY A FAIR -- A FAIR DAY'S WORK FOR A 
20:44:11 FAIR DAY'S PAY, THAT THOSE ARE NOT JUST IN THE CONSTRUCTION PART BUT ALSO 
20:44:11 ONGOING.

20:44:17 MY OTHER SUGGESTION AS I THANK YOU IS TO UPDATE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS TO 
20:44:21 CURRENT NEED THAT ARE VERY SERIOUS AS WE'VE HAD FOUR YEARS OF VERY BAD AIR.

20:44:28 AND I THINK THE ONLY OTHER THING I WANT TO SAY IS, THANK YOU TO MARK 
20:44:34 HUNGERFORD, WHO IS SO GREAT AT WORKING WITH US ON THIS PROJECT, AND I WANT TO 
20:44:37 THANK OUR ENVIRONMENTAL PARTNERS, THE TEAMS SISTERS AND THE SIERRA CLUB FOR 
20:44:43 ALWAYS HAVING THE BACKS OF COMMUNITIES LIKE OURS THAT NEED GOOD JOBS AND 
20:44:44 GREAT AIR.

20:44:44 THANK YOU, FREMONT.

20:44:47 >> Ms. Gauthier: THANK YOU.

20:44:50 THE NEXT SPEAKER IS WILLIAM  YRAGUI.

20:44:58 >> ACTUALLY EVERYTHING I WAS GOING TO SAY HAS BEEN SAID BY JACOB AND MARTHA, 
20:45:04 BUT MY COMMENDATIONS TO THE COUNCIL FOR HEARING THIS OUT, AND WITH RESPECT.

20:45:06 THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

20:45:07 >> Ms. Gauthier: THANK YOU.

20:45:10 THE NEXT SPEAKER IS DOUG BLOCH.

20:45:14 >> GOOD EVENING.

20:45:14 CAN YOU HEAR ME?

20:45:16 >> YES.

20:45:16 >> THANK YOU.

20:45:18 GOOD EVENING, MAYOR AND COUNCILMEMBERS.

20:45:27 MY NAME IS DOUG BLOCH, I'M WITH TEAMSTERS JOINT COUNCIL 7.

20:45:31 IN FREMONT, THAT INCLUDES WORKERS AT UPS AND THE PEOPLE WHO PICK UP YOUR 
20:45:33 GARBAGE AND RECYCLING.

20:45:39 TEAMSTERS NOT ONLY WORK IN LOGISTICS, WE LIVE IN THE COMMUNITIES BUILT 
20:45:43 AROUND THESE FACILITIES, IN THE BAY AREA, WE ARE PARTNERING WITH THE 
20:45:46 SIERRA CLUB AND OTHER LABOR AND COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS TO ADDRESS THE 
20:45:48 IMPACT OF THE LOGISTICS INDUSTRY.

20:45:56 AS YOU KNOW, WE'VE RAISED CONCERNS NOT ONLY ABOUT THIS PROJECT BUT ALSO THE 
20:45:59 LARGER IMPACT OF THESE SORTS OF  DEVELOPMENTS ON TRAFFIC, AIR QUALITY, 
20:45:59 AND JOBS.

20:46:06 THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE FOR E-COMMERCE LAST MILE DELIVERY STATIONS, AND I 
20:46:11 WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT THE CONCERNS WE RAISED GO BEYOND AMAZON.

20:46:16 HOWEVER, AS YOU HEARD, WE TALKED WITH THE APPLICANT.

20:46:20 BASED ON OUR UNDERSTANDING NOW, WE ARE WITHDRAWING OUR OBJECTIONS TO THE 
20:46:20 PROJECT.

20:46:27 AND THAT BEING SAID, WE STRONGLY FEEL THE WAREHOUSE PROJECTS NOT ONLY NEEDED 
20:46:31 DEEPER ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW, BUT OUR ZONING AND PLANNING CODES NEED TO 
20:46:33 CATCH UP TO THEM AS THEY SPREAD  THROUGHOUT OUR COMMUNITIES.

20:46:39 AND WHILE WE'RE HAPPY THESE PROJECTS ARE BEING BUILT WITH SOME UNION LABOR, 
20:46:45 AND TO MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS IN THE BUILDING TRADES, WE POUR ALL REDI-MIX 
20:46:50 CONCRETE, WE HOPE THAT THE WORKERS THE TENANTS HIRE HAVE GOOD UNION JOBS TOO.

20:46:55 GIVEN THE ECONOMIC IMPACT ANALYSIS WE HEARD CALLING FOR MORE INDUSTRIAL 
20:46:59 DEVELOPMENT IN FREMONT, WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU ON THAT IN THE 
20:46:59 FUTURE.

20:47:00 THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.

20:47:03 >> Ms. Gauthier: THANK YOU.

20:47:08 THE NEXT SPEAKER IS DAVID  CALERO.

20:47:10 DAVID?

20:47:13 >> MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL, GOOD EVENING.

20:47:17 I'M DAVID CALERO, A LIFELONG FREMONT RESIDENT.

20:47:21 I'M HERE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE ALBRAE INDUSTRIAL PROJECT.

20:47:27 IN 2015 I GRADUATED FROM THE  IBW'S APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM, MY BROTHER 
20:47:33 FOLLOWED ME A FEW YEARS D. BEING ABLE TO LIVE AND WORK LOCAL IS A BLESSING.

20:47:38 I'M EXPECTING MY FIRST CHILD IN A FEW MONTHS, AND I CAN AFFORD TO STAY IF 
20:47:43 THE TOWN I WAS BORN IN AND TAKE CARE OF MY YOUNG FAMILY BECAUSE I'M NOW A 
20:47:43  JOURNEYMAN ELECTRICIAN.

20:47:47 I WANT OTHER YOUNG FREMONT RESIDENTS TO HAVE THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES.

20:47:53 APPROVING THE AUBREY INDUSTRIAL PROJECT WILL DO JUST THAT, THE DEVELOPER, 
20:48:00 SCANNELL PROPERTIES, HAS AGREED TO PROVIDE CONSTRUCTION WORKERS AND DRK 
20:48:04 ENROLLED IN THE CALIFORNIA STATE APPROVED APPRENTICESHIP  PROGRAMS.

20:48:12 IT'S GOING TO BE BUILT IN AN EXISTING -- ES PESH LITTLE SINCE AS PROPOSED IT 
20:48:15 WON'T BE IN A HIGH DISTRIBUTION CENTER.

20:48:23 FREMONT NEEDS -- WILL GET MILLIONS IN ADDITION FALL REVENUE TO SUPPORT CITY 
20:48:23  SERVICES.

20:48:29 FOR ALL THESE REASONS I ASK YOU TO VOTE YES ON THE ALBRAE INDUSTRIAL PROJECT.

20:48:31 THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE AND HEARING ME OUT.

20:48:31 THANK YOU.

20:48:32 >> Ms. Gauthier: THANK YOU.

20:48:35 THE LAST SPEAKER IS MIKE BUCCI.

20:48:39 >> YES, GOOD EVENING.

20:48:42 GOOD EVENING, MADAME MAYOR AND FREMONT CITY COUNCIL.

20:48:44 MY NAME IS MIKE BUCCI.

20:48:48 MANY OF YOU KNOW ME AS THE COUNCILMEMBER FROM NEWARK.

20:48:56 I'M REACHING OUT TO YOU TONIGHT, WE'RE CERTAINLY HAPPY FOR FREMONT AND TO SEE 
20:48:59 THIS AREA START TO GET SOME IMPROVEMENTS THAT AREN'T FURNITURE 
20:49:04 STORES AND WE'RE FIRM BELIEVERS THAT A  RISING TIDE LIFTS ALL BOATS, SO 
20:49:12 HOPEFULLY WITH THE DEVELOPMENT AND IMPROVEMENT IN THIS AREA, SIX IF JOBS 
20:49:14 WILL CREATE.

20:49:20 I'M ALSO A MILLWRIGHT, WHICH IS AN ARM OF THE CARPENTERS, CAME UP THROUGH THE 
20:49:26 APPRENTICESHIP AND I'M ABLE TO STILL AFFORD TO WORK IN NEWARK WHERE I LIVE 
20:49:29 BECAUSE OF THOSE OPPORTUNITIES, SO I'M EXCITED TO HEAR SOME OF THOSE THINGS 
20:49:30 ADDED TO THIS PROJECT.

20:49:33 WE DO HAVE A FEW CONCERNS,  MAINLY A NOTIFICATION WITH US.

20:49:41 YOU KNOW, THIS PROJECT AS PROPOSED SHARES TWO INTERSECTIONS WITH US, AND 
20:49:46 IT LOOKS LIKE ANOTHER POSSIBLE THIRD INTERSECTION TO BE BUILT AT 
20:49:50 ENCYCLOPEDIA CIRCLE AND STEVENSON, WHICH WILL FUNNEL THE TRUCK TRAFFIC 
20:49:51 OUT OF THE AREA.

20:49:57 SO YOU KNOW, UNFORTUNATELY WE ONLY HEARD ABOUT THIS AFTER 4:00, SO I SAT 
20:50:01 DOWN WITH STAFF AND HAD ABOUT AN HOUR TO GO THROUGH IT, AND WE COULDN'T 
20:50:07 REALLY FIND AN ANALYSIS BETWEEN THE TRUCK TRAFFIC IN THE ORIGINAL EIR AND 
20:50:08 THIS ONE.

20:50:14 IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S THE SAME NUMBERS, AND I'VE HEARD A NUMBER OF PEOPLE SAY 
20:50:19 THERE'S NO RESIDENTIAL IN THIS AREA, BUT THE TRUTH IS, ENCYCLOPEDIA CIRCLE 
20:50:23 COMING OUT ON STEVENSON IS DIRECTLY ACROSS THE STREET FROM THE WALKING 
20:50:26 MARRIOTT AT TOWNHOMES.

20:50:32 SO LEARNING WHAT WE'VE LEARNED TONIGHT AS SOME OF THE BAY AREA QUALITY 
20:50:36 MANAGEMENT DISTRICT, I WOULD CERTAINLY APPRECIATE AN EXTRA 30 SECONDS.

20:50:40 I SEE I'M RUNNING OUT OF TIME.

20:50:42 MADAME MAYOR, WOULD YOU GIVE THAT TO ME?

20:50:51 >> Ms. Gauthier: THAT'S AT THE MAYOR'S DISCRETION.

20:50:51 MAYOR?

20:50:55 >> Mayor Mei: GO AHEAD AND DO THAT FOR 30 SECONDS.

20:50:57 >> THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR.

20:50:58 >> Mayor Mei: I HAD TO UNMUTE.

20:50:59 >> THANK YOU.

20:51:06 YOU KNOW, SO JUST -- INTO THE FUTURE, PROJECTS LIKE THIS THAT OBVIOUSLY HAVE 
20:51:12 A IMPACT ON BOTH OF OUR CITIES, IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE A WEEK OR SO TO 
20:51:17 REVIEW THESE THINGS JUST SO WE CAN SEE ABOUT POTENTIAL IMPACT AND HAVE SOME 
20:51:21 INPUT WITH STAFF AS TO ANY CONDITIONS THAT MAY COME UP, ESPECIALLY 
20:51:26 CONSIDERING THAT YOUR OWN TRAFFICS THAT HE SAYS THAT THIS IS PROBABLY GOING TO 
20:51:29 WARRANT ANOTHER SHARED INTERSECTION.

20:51:31 WITH THAT, I WILL YIELD MY TIME.

20:51:31 THANK YOU.

20:51:42 >> Mayor Mei: I THINK THAT WAS THE LAST OF THE SPEAKERS FROM THE PUBLIC 
20:51:44 COMMENT, AND I WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE THE PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD.

20:51:46 AND I WILL TURN IT BACK TO COUNCIL.

20:51:50 I HAVE SOME COMMENTS TO ADD BECAUSE I HADN'T ADDED THEM YET, BUT I'LL START 
20:51:51 WITH OUR COUNCIL FIRST.

20:51:57 COUNCILMEMBER -- VICE MAYOR SALWAN, I SEE YOUR HAND RAISED.

20:52:01 >> Vice Mayor Salwan: THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR.

20:52:04 I SEE THE CONCERNS FROM COUNCILMEMBER BUCCI.

20:52:09 I WAS WONDERING IF STAFF COULD BRIEFLY COMMENT ON THE ISSUES HE RAISED JUST 
20:52:11 SO WE CAN AT LEAST HAVE SOME UNDERSTANDING.

20:52:17 >> THANK YOU.

20:52:21 THERE WAS CORRELATION BETWEEN THE CITY'S PUBLIC WORKS DEPARTMENT AND 
20:52:25 PUBLIC WORKS WITH THE CITY OF NEWARK SPECIFICALLY AS IT RELATES TO THE 
20:52:29 PROPOSED TRAFFIC SIGNAL AT ENCYCLOPEDIA AND STEVENSON, BECAUSE OF COURSE SOME 
20:52:33 OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE WOULD BE ON CITY OF NEWARK PROPERTY, SO THERE WAS 
20:52:37 COORDINATION ASSOCIATED WITH THAT, AS WELL AS CORD NATION UPON APPLICATION 
20:52:37 RECEIPT.

20:52:44 WE DID KIND OF AN OUTSIDE AGENCY DISTRIBUTION OF PROJECT INFORMATION 
20:52:46 THAT INCLUDED CITY OF NEWARK.

20:52:52 I BELIEVE WE DO HAVE PUBLIC WORKS STAFF ON THIS CALL AS  WELL, OR IN THIS 
20:53:01 MEETING AS WELL, THAT MAY BE ABLE TO EXPAND ON THAT COORDINATION.

20:53:01 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

20:53:07 >> Vice Mayor Salwan: SO JUST TO CONFIRM, THIS IS OVER SOME PERIOD OF 
20:53:07 TIME, CORRECT?

20:53:13 >> I DO BELIEVE SO, YEAH.

20:53:20 I THINK WHEN THE TRAFFIC -- OR THE SIGNAL WARRANT ANALYSIS CAME BACK 
20:53:25 IDENTIFYING ENCYCLOPEDIA AND STEVENSON AS NECESSITATING A TRAFFIC SIGNAL, 
20:53:33 THERE WAS  OUTREACH AT THAT TIME TO THE CITY OF NEWARK TO DISCUSS THE --

20:53:37 >> Vice Mayor Salwan: ARE YOU GOING TO HAVE PUBLIC WORKS TALK TO THAT OR ARE 
20:53:39 WE JUST GOING TO MOVE FORWARD?

20:53:47 >> Mayor Mei: I THINK HANS IS ON RIGHT NOW --

20:53:50 >> Mr. Larsen: VICE MAYOR  SALWAN, I SEE WE HAVE SOMEONE FROM OUR 
20:53:52 TRANSPORTATION STAFF ON THE PANEL.

20:54:02 DO YOU HAVE INFORMATION ON COORDINATION AND TIMING WITH THE CITY OF NEWARK 
20:54:03 THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO HEAR?

20:54:05 >> YES, GOOD EVENING.

20:54:07 I DO NOT HAVE ANYTHING FURTHER TO ADD.

20:54:15 I KNOW WE'VE SENT A MEMO TO THEM AT THE ONSET BECAUSE THIS SPECIFIC 
20:54:21 INTERSECTION HAS ALREADY BEEN WARRANTED FOR TRAFFIC SIGNAL EVEN FOR THE 
20:54:30 PREVIOUS PROJECT, SO THIS IS NOT NEW BUT ANYTHING -- ANY FURTHER DETAILED 
20:54:34 COORDINATION WITH NEWARK AT LEAST TO MIND HAS NOT BEEN DONE.

20:54:37 I DO HAVE OTHER STAFF PERSONS THAT HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THIS THAT I'D HAVE TO 
20:54:42 SEE IF THEY HAVE ANY PERSONAL COORDINATION OUTSIDE OF MY KNOWLEDGE, 
20:54:46 BUT I PERSONALLY HAVE NOT HAD ANY DETAIL YET.

20:54:52 SO UNTIL WE CAN DRAW SOME TRAFFIC SIGNAL PLANS, THEN OF COURSE THAT WILL 
20:55:01 BE SOMETHING THAT WE WILL TALK WITH  NEWARK, -- RIGHT AWAY IS WITHIN THEIR 
20:55:02 JURISDICTION.

20:55:06 >> Mr. Larsen: SO MADAME MAYOR, VICE MAYOR, JUST TO ADD TO THAT, I THINK 
20:55:14 WEAN MIRZ AND I, WE HAVE OTHER STAFF ON OUR TEAM THAT WORKED ON THIS PROJECT.

20:55:17 I'D BE HAPPY TO JUST PROVIDE A FOLLOW-UP EMAIL TO THE COUNCIL IN 
20:55:19 TERMS OF THE COORDINATION WE DID.

20:55:24 I THINK GENERALLY WE PRIDE OURSELVES IN HAVING A GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR 
20:55:31 NEIGHBORS AND I'M PRETTY CERTAIN THAT THERE WAS COORDINATION AND I FULLY 
20:55:33 UNDERSTAND MAYBE ON THE NEWARK SIDE SOME OF THE FOLKS THAT THEY WERE 
20:55:39 TALKING TO MAYBE WEREN'T AWARE OF SOME OF THE CONVERSATIONS WE HAD, SO I'D BE 
20:55:44 HAPPY TO CLARIFY FOR COUNCIL AFTERWARDS THE LEVEL OF COORDINATION WE HAD.

20:55:50 OBVIOUSLY THE PROJECT GOES FORWARD, THERE WILL BE CLOSE COORDINATION IN 
20:55:54 THE ACTUAL DEVELOPMENT OF PLANS AND IMPLEMENTATION OF ANY TRAFFIC SIGNALS 
20:55:56 THAT WE SHARE BETWEEN FREMONT AND NEWARK.

20:56:00 >> THANK YOU.

20:56:01 THANK YOU, MR. LARSEN, APPRECIATE THAT.

20:56:05 WE DEFINITELY WANT TO BE GOOD NEIGHBOR NEIGHBORS SO I APPRECIATE 
20:56:08 COUNCILMEMBER BEU CHEE COMING OUT AND LETTING US NO.

20:56:11 HAVING SAID THAT, I THINK THE GOAL I THINK WAS AHEAD OF ITS TIME.

20:56:17 I REALLY LIKE THE CONCEPT, KIND OF LIKE DISNEY LAND RIGHT HERE IN FREMONT, YOU 
20:56:20 COULD SAMPLE ALL KINDS OF FOODS, DIFFERENT RESTAURANTS, DIFFERENT 
20:56:25 ENTERTAINMENT AND GREAT CONCEPT, BUT IT'S I GUESS WAY AHEAD OF OUR TIME.

20:56:29 I'M SURE 20, 30 YEARS FROM NOW, WE'LL WISH WE HAD IT BACK AGAIN.

20:56:35 HAVING SAID THAT, THIS IS A PROJECT WE HAVE BEFORE US, AND THIS IS -- ONE CH 
20:56:37 THOSE IS A GOOD COMPROMISE.

20:56:44 IT PROVIDES A NEED WE HAVE IN OUR CITY FOR ADVANCED MANUFACTURING, FOR R & D 
20:56:45 JOBS THAT WE HAVE.

20:56:46 IT KIND OF A BLIGHTED AREA.

20:56:54 I THINK WE'VE ALL DROVE BY IT, WE WISH IT WAS MORE VIBRANT, AND I THINK THIS 
20:56:59 IS AS GOOD OF A PROJECT WE'RE GOING TO GET CONSIDERING WHAT THE MARKET WANTS.

20:57:05 I DO APPRECIATE THAT WE ARE GETTING SOME BENEFITS SUCH AS LOCAL HIRE, 
20:57:06 UNION JOBS.

20:57:13 NEWER CARPENTERS AND ALL THE DIFFERENT TRADES ARE GOING TO BE ON HERE, AND 
20:57:20 ALSO EVEN SIERRA CLUB AND TEAMSTERS APPROVING OF THIS, SO I THINK THIS IS 
20:57:25 SOMETHING THAT ALL SIDES CAME TOGETHER, THIS IS GOVERNMENT, THE 
20:57:29 SAUSAGE-MAKING, WHERE WE WORK TOGETHER AND TRY TO FIND SOME COMPROMISES AND 
20:57:30 TRY TO GET SOMETHING DONE.

20:57:35 SO I THINK OVERALL THIS IS NET POSITIVE FOR CITY OF FREMONT, AND I WILL BE 
20:57:36 SUPPORTING THIS PROJECT.

20:57:36 THANK YOU.

20:57:38 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

20:57:41 NEXT SPEAKER IS RICK JONES.

20:57:42 COUNCILMEMBER JONES.

20:57:45 THEN I ALSO HAVE MY COMMENTS BEFORE ANY VOTES ARE MADE.

20:57:46 THANK YOU.

20:57:49 >> Councilmember Jones: THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR.

20:57:53 THANK YOU TO EVERYBODY WHO GAVE A PRESENTATION, BOTH MARKS FROM THE CITY 
20:57:55 AND FROM SCANNELL.

20:57:58 YOU KNOW, I AGREE WITH VICE MAYOR SALWAN, I THINK THIS IS A GREAT PROJECT.

20:58:03 THIS IS AN AREA THAT'S -- IT WAS SLATED FOR GREAT THINGS.

20:58:09 UNFORTUNATELY, THEY MADE THESE PLANS IN 2007 AND WHAT HAPPENED IN 2008, OUR 
20:58:10 EXEE FELL APART.

20:58:16 AND I THINK THAT IS PROBABLY PART OF THE REASON, BUT IT DID NOT GO FORWARD, 
20:58:21 AND WE HAVE SEEN THIS SITE SIT VACANT FOR MORE THAN 15 YEARS NOW.

20:58:23 YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT THE PRETTIEST OF SITES.

20:58:28 YOU'RE COULD COMING OUT OF A WAL-MART PARKING LOT, LOOK ACROSS THE STREET AT 
20:58:32 THIS EMPTY SHELL OF A BUILDING, ALL THE WEEDS AND ALL THE OVERGROWN 
20:58:34 LANDSCAPING AND EVERYTHING ELSE, IT'S JUST BEEN KIND OF A MESS.

20:58:42 I REALLY APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT THIS DEVELOPER HAS COME IN WITH THIS 
20:58:45 PROJECT AND THEY MADE SO MANY COMMITMENTS TO THE LOCAL COMMUNITY.

20:58:54 THEY'RE HIRING UNION LABOR, THEY'RE WORKING WITH ROP TO HELP OUR YOUNG 
20:58:57 PEOPLE GET INTO THE TRADES WHICH IS A HUGE BENEFIT.

20:59:02 SO MANY YOUNG PEOPLE NOW, THEY'RE NOT USED TO WORKING WITH THEIR HANDS AND 
20:59:07 THIS GETS THEM BACK TO THAT SM IT'S GOING TO PROVIDE A NUMBER OF JOBS FOR 
20:59:07 OUR LOCAL RESIDENTS.

20:59:11 I THINK IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO BE -- AND DON'T QUOTE ME ON  THIS, BUT LESS 
20:59:16 TRAFFIC THAN WHAT THE GLOBE WOULD HAVE GENERATED HAD IT BUILT OUT THE WAY IT 
20:59:17 WAS INTENDED TO.

20:59:19 SO THAT'S KIND OF A PLUS.

20:59:21 IT'S NOT GOING TO BE A BIG AMAZON HUB.

20:59:27 YOU CAN SEE FROM THE DESIGN OF THE BUILDING, IT'S REALLY NOT CONDUCIVE TO 
20:59:31 A BUNCH OF VEHICLES STAYING THERE IN A LOT OVERNIGHT LIKE THEY WOULD AT ONE 
20:59:33 OF THESE BIG AMAZON FACILITIES.

20:59:38 THIS IS AN IN AND OUT FOR DELIVERY, THOSE KINDS OF THINGS.

20:59:41 AGAIN, HAPPY FOR THE UNION  LABOR, FOR THE LOCAL HIRES.

20:59:44 I'M GLAD TO SEE WE'RE GOING TO DO SOME TRAFFIC IMPROVEMENTS.

20:59:48 ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN A LITTLE BIT DIFFICULT AS YOU COME OUT 
20:59:52 OF THE WAL-MART DRIVEWAY IS IF YOU LOOK TO YOUR LEFT, TO THE SOUTH, YOU HAVE 
20:59:54 BASICALLY A 90 DEGREE CURVE IN THE ROAD.

20:59:58 AND SOME PEOPLE LIKE TO SEE HOW FAST THEY CAN TAKE THAT CURVE AND SO IT 
21:00:01 GETS A LITTLE BIT CHALLENGING TO GET OUT OF SOME OF THOSE DRIVEWAYS.

21:00:09 SO A SIGNAL THERE WILL BE A HUGE BENEFIT, AS WELL AS SIDEWALKS ON THE 
21:00:12 WEST SIDE STREEFT, WHERE IF THERE ARE SIDEWALKS NOW, YOU CAN'T SEE THEM.

21:00:18 EVERYTHING IS JUST SO OVERGROWN, I'M GOING TO IMAGINE WHATEVER IS 
21:00:19 UNDERNEATH THERE TOTALLY UNUSABLE.

21:00:23 SO THIS GOING TO PROVIDE MORE CONNECTIVITY, IT'S GOING TO PROVIDE A 
21:00:30 LOT OF TRAVEL TO LOCAL BUSINESSES FOR MEALS AND SUCH, THE LOCAL RESTAURANTS 
21:00:31 ARE GOING TO BENEFIT.

21:00:36 WORKERS WILL PROBABLY TAKE THEIR LUNCH HOURS AND GO TO SOME OF THE RETAIL 
21:00:41 AREAS SO IN MY MIND IT'S KIND OF A WIN, WIN, WIN AND I AM FULLY SUPPORTIVE OF 
21:00:42 MOVING THE PROJECT FORWARD.

21:00:42 THANK YOU.

21:00:59 COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, THANK YOU.

21:01:00 >> Councilmember Kassan: THANK YOU.

21:01:09 I'M VERY, VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THIS KIND OF RE-USE OF OLD  CAR-ORIENTED RETAIL 
21:01:09 SHOPPING CENTERS.

21:01:11 I THINK THOSE ARE NOT A THING OF THE FUTURE.

21:01:17 I THINK THOSE ARE A THING OF THE PAST AND I WAS VERY, VERY HAPPY TO SEE THE 
21:01:18 PROPOSED RE-USE OF THE SITE.

21:01:22 I AM CONCERNED, I HEAR BHA YOU'RE SAYING THAT IT'S UNLIKELY TO BE THE 
21:01:27 TYPE OF USE THAT WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT IN TERMS OF ALL THE POSSIBLE 
21:01:34 GENERATION I WISH YOU WOULD MAKE A 

21:01:36 COMMITMENT ABOUT THAT BUT I'M 

21:01:37 HEARING THAT YOU'RE NOT WILLING 

21:01:38 TO DO THAT.

21:01:40 SO WE HOPE THAT THAT DOES REMAIN 

21:01:42 TRUE THAT THAT DOES NOT BECOME 

21:01:43 THAT TYPE OF A USE BECAUSE I 

21:01:46 THINK THAT WOULD POTENTIALLY 

21:01:48 HAVE SOME NEGATIVE IMPACTS.

21:01:49 I ALSO AM CONCERNED ABOUT THE 

21:01:57 FACT THAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT 

21:02:01 EMISSIONS THASH SIGNIFICANT AND 

21:02:02 UNVOIBL.

21:02:06  

21:02:07 UNAVOID ANNAL.

21:02:10 ABLE.

21:02:12 I REALLY REALLY HOPE WE CAN DO 

21:02:14 EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO TRY TO 

21:02:22 PREVENT NEGATIVE NOT JUST THE 

21:02:24 PEOPLE WHO WORK THERE BUT WHO DO 

21:02:25 THEIR SHOPPING THERE.

21:02:28 I'M REALLY HAPPY TO HEAR THOSE 

21:02:31 PEOPLE WHO WERE OPPOSED ARE NOW 

21:02:33 HAPPY WITH IT SO I'M HAPPY TO 

21:02:35 74th IT.

21:02:36 THANK YOU.

21:02:38 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU 

21:02:39 COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, 

21:02:41 COUNCILMEMBER SHAO.

21:02:42 >> Councilmember Shao:   THANK 

21:02:43 YOU, MADAM MAYOR.

21:02:46 I BELIEVE THIS PROJECT 

21:02:49 DEMONSTRATES THE PRACTICALITY OF 

21:02:51 CITY STAFF IN THE EVER CHANGING 

21:02:53 WORLD AND EVER CHANGING ECONOMY.

21:02:55 I BELIEVE THIS CHANGE WILL NOT 

21:02:57 ONLY BRING ALL THOSE BENEFITS 

21:03:01 LISTED IN THE PRESENTATION BUT 

21:03:03 ALSO, WILL HAVE A VERY POSITIVE 

21:03:05 IMPACT ON THE LOCAL ECONOMY.

21:03:08 BESIDES, I'M VERY GLAD TO SEE 

21:03:10 THAT IT CAN ALSO GENERATE 

21:03:18 REVENUES FOR SCHOOL BOARD -- 

21:03:20 FREMONT UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT, 

21:03:21 AS WELL AS THE COMMUNITY, THANKS 

21:03:23 FOR HALF A MILLION DOLLAR 

21:03:28 VOLUNTARY COMMUNITY BENEFIT 

21:03:29 DONATION FROM THIS PROJECT.

21:03:32 SO I'M VERY SUPPORTIVE TO THIS 

21:03:32 PROJECT.

21:03:36 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

21:03:36 COUNCILMEMBER KENG.

21:03:40 >> Councilmember Keng:   THANK 

21:03:41 YOU, MADAM MAYOR.

21:03:42 I WON'T REPEAT A LOT OF THE 

21:03:44 STUFF THAT HAS BEEN SAID BUT I'M 

21:03:46 GLAD TO SEE THAT SCANNELL IS 

21:03:49 CHOOSING TO INVEST IN OUR CITY, 

21:03:52 CHOOSING THE SITE TO BUILD THE 

21:03:54 NEW TREND OF THE TYPE OF 

21:03:56 FACILITIES THAT WILL BE NEEDED.

21:03:58 AND I THINK THEY HAVE PROVEN 

21:04:00 THAT THEY HAVE BEEN BUILDING A 

21:04:01 LOT OF GREAT PROJECTS IN THE 

21:04:04 PAST AROUND THE COUNTRY AND THE 

21:04:05 AREA, IN THE REGION.

21:04:09 SO I'M GLAD TO HEAR ALSO THEIR 

21:04:11 COMMITMENT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE 

21:04:15 WON'T HAVE THOSE TYPE OF 

21:04:17 FACILITY.

21:04:19 BECAUSE DURING HIGH SCHOOL I WAS 

21:04:20 JUST LIVING RIGHT OFF THE 

21:04:24 SCORNER OF CEDAR AND STEVENSON.

21:04:26 SO I KNOW HOW CLOSE IT IS TO 

21:04:27 RESIDENTIAL AREA.

21:04:31 AND I AM GLAD THAT THEY'RE ALSO 

21:04:33 MAKING A COMMITMENT OF 

21:04:36 INSTALLING THE SOLAR PANELS AND 

21:04:38 ALSO, GLAD TO SEE THAT WE NOW 

21:04:40 HAVE SIERRA CLUB SUPPORT.

21:04:42 SO THAT ALSO MEANS A LOT TO ME.

21:04:43 SO THANK YOU, AND I THINK THIS 

21:04:46 IS A WIN-WIN
21:04:47  SOLUTION THAT WE 

21:04:48 HAVE AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO 

21:04:50 SEEING THIS PROJECT COME ABOUT.

21:04:53 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

21:04:53 COUNCILMEMBER COX.

21:04:56 >> Councilmember Cox:   THANK 

21:04:57 YOU.

21:05:00 I DO BELIEVE THAT THIS IS, 

21:05:01 FROM -- BASED ON EVERYONE'S 

21:05:04 DISCUSSION, THE PRESENTATIONS, 

21:05:06 THE SPEAKERS, OVERALL, I BELIEVE 

21:05:09 THAT THIS IS A WIN-WIN PROJECT.

21:05:10 WE'RE CREATING JOBS.

21:05:12 WE'RE GETTING PEOPLE BACK TO 

21:05:14 WORK.

21:05:15 YOU KNOW, WE'RE HAVING THE 

21:05:17 ADDITIONAL SUPPORT OF 

21:05:19 COLLABORATIONS ACROSS DIFFERENT 

21:05:22 ORGANIZATIONS, FROM THE MISSION 

21:05:26 ROP, TO THE CITY OF FREMONT, TO 

21:05:28 SCANNELL BRINGING IN THEIR 

21:05:29 MIXTURE OF DIFFERENT BUSINESSES 

21:05:32 THAT COULD REALLY BE UTILIZED 

21:05:33 HERE IN FREMONT
21:05:34 , AND SHARED 

21:05:34 AROUND THE RENAL.

21:05:39  REGION.

21:05:41 BEING CLOSE TO 8Y AND 680 I 

21:05:44 THINK IT HAS ITS ADVANTAGES.

21:05:45 IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO 

21:05:48 LOOK AT THESE TYPE OF PROPOSALS 

21:05:51 THAT ARE BEING ABLE TO TURN WHAT 

21:05:53 WE AREN'T GETTING ANY REVENUE, 

21:05:56 NO COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS AND 

21:05:57 NOW WE'RE TURNING IT TO 

21:06:01 SOMETHING THAT COULD BE A 

21:06:03 WIN-WIN TO EVERYONE.

21:06:05 I'M HAPPY TO LEARN ABOUT THE 

21:06:07 UNION SUPPORT, THE SIERRA CLUB, 

21:06:10 THE COMMUNITY RELATIONSHIP, THAT 

21:06:13 WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE EVEN WITH 

21:06:14 THE ELECTRICAL VEHICLE CHARGING 

21:06:17 STATIONS AND SOLAR, AND EVEN IN 

21:06:19 ADDITION WITH THE HELP OF 

21:06:19 TRANSPORTATION IMPROVEMENTS THAT 

21:06:23 HAVE ALREADY BEEN DISCUSSED FROM 

21:06:26 THE TRAFFIC SIGNALS TO THE 

21:06:28 ROADWAY AND CURVES AND ALL OF 

21:06:32 THAT, I THINK THAT WILL MAKE A 

21:06:32 BIG INVESTMENT.

21:06:34 BUT ALSO THE MONEYS THAT WE ARE 

21:06:36 COLLECTING FROM IMPACT FEES, 

21:06:37 THAT'S SOMETHING WE CAN TURN 

21:06:38 AROUND AND USE FOR AFFORDABLE 

21:06:39 HOUSING, TO HELP THE COMMUNITY 

21:06:41 WITH THE JOBS WITH THE 

21:06:42 DEVELOPMENT SO PEOPLE CAN STAY 

21:06:44 IN FREMONT AND LIVE, WORK AND 

21:06:45 PLAY.

21:06:48 I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT THAT 

21:06:51 AS THERE'S A SHARE OF REVENUE 

21:06:53 BESIDES THE CITY OF FREMONT 

21:06:55 GETTING CLOSE TO ALMOST $3 

21:06:56 MILLION OVER THE TEN YEARS BUT 

21:06:59 ALSO SHARING IN -- ON THE 

21:07:02 REVENUE WOULD BE THE FREMONT 

21:07:04 UNIFIED SCHOOLS, THAT WOULD BE A 

21:07:06 WONDERFUL BENEFIT TO HELP OUR 

21:07:10 EDUCATION SYSTEM HERE.

21:07:12 AND OVERALL, WHO IS GOING TO 

21:07:16 GIVE US $500,000?

21:07:20 THAT WOULD BE VERY INTERESTED IN 

21:07:21 INVESTING.

21:07:22 SCANNELL IS INVESTING IN THE 

21:07:24 COMMUNITY WITH $500,000 GIVEN UP 

21:07:25 FRONT THERE.

21:07:28 I THINK OVERALL MAN ADDING ON 

21:07:29 SOMETHING TO MAYBE CHECK IN ON 

21:07:31 THE QUALITY LEVELS AS NECESSARY, 

21:07:36 IN THE AREAS AS VOICED JUST TO 

21:07:37 CHECK IN HOW THINGS ARE GOING ON 

21:07:38 THAT.

21:07:40 AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT 

21:07:42 THERE'S SOME SORT OF FLEXIBILITY 

21:07:45 IN TERMS OF THE WORK, OF THE 

21:07:46 WORK SCHEDULES.

21:07:47 AND THINGS LIKE THAT.

21:07:49 AND USING REALLY A LOT OF THE 

21:07:51 TECHNOLOGY AS WE TALK ABOUT THE 

21:07:54 RETAIL THAT IT'S NOT TRADITIONAL 

21:07:56 RETAIL IT'S GOING TO BE 

21:07:58 E-COMMERCE AND IF YOU HAVE 

21:08:01 SEMICONDUCTOR, WHATEVER THE 

21:08:03 PRODUCTS THEY ARE PROVIDING, 

21:08:06  

21:08:08 PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, THAT WE 

21:08:10 CAN UTILIZE TO BE MORE EFFICIENT 

21:08:11 AND EFFECTIVE IN CARRYING OUT 

21:08:14 THE WORK EVERY DAY SO THAT THERE 

21:08:16 IS SOME TELEWORKING, THERE IS 

21:08:17 DIFFERENT SHIFORTS AND ALLOWING 

21:08:20 PEOPLE TO HAVE A BALANCE OF WORK 

21:08:23 LIFE HERE WHILE WORKING AT THIS 

21:08:26 PARTICULAR AREA OF FREMONT.

21:08:30 BUT IT'S A UNITING OF 

21:08:31 COLLABORATIONS, YOU SEE THIS AS 

21:08:32 A BIG ONE FOR EVERYONE.

21:08:36 THAT IT'S A COLLABORATION OF 

21:08:37 BRINGING EVERYBODY TOGETHER FOR 

21:08:39 THAT AND BEING ABLE TO SEE HOW 

21:08:42 WE CAN CONTINUE TO MOVE FREMONT 

21:08:44 FORWARD IN ALL ASPECTS.

21:08:44 SO I'M DEFINITELY GOING TO BE 

21:08:45 SUPPORTING THIS PROJECT.

21:08:48 AND I APPRECIATE EVERYONE THAT'S 

21:08:50 BEEN INVOLVED AND ALL OF YOUR 

21:08:52 EFFORTS AND WORK TO MAKE THIS 

21:08:52 HAPPEN.

21:08:54 THANK YOU.

21:08:55 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

21:08:56 I'D LIKE TO ADD MY COMMENTS TO 

21:08:57 THIS.

21:09:00 ONE, I KNOW THAT FOR THE SCHOOL 

21:09:01 DISTRICT IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO 

21:09:03 HAVE THE FUNDING AND SUPPORT.

21:09:04 BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, HAVING 

21:09:07 BEEN ACTIVE IN THE ROP FOR MANY 

21:09:08 YEARS I THINK THAT THIS IS 

21:09:09 EXACTLY WHAT WE NEED.

21:09:12 JUST THIS WEEK WE TALKED WITH 

21:09:15 THE NATIONAL CONVERSATION ABOUT 

21:09:16 HOW MANUFACTURING IS REALLY KEY.

21:09:19 AND I STRONGLY BELIEVE IN IMRFG 

21:09:22  

21:09:26 UTILIZING LOCAL HIRE AND HAVING 

21:09:27 THAT INCOME STREAM AND THE JOB 

21:09:30 TRAININGS AND APPRENTICE SHIP 

21:09:32 THAT WE NEED WITHIN OUR OWN 

21:09:33 COMMUNITY.

21:09:37 NOT ONLY FREMONT BUT MISSION 

21:09:38 VALLEY ROP IS A STRONG 

21:09:44 SUPPORTER, I THINK THAT IS VERY 

21:09:45 IMPORTANT TO ME.

21:09:47 I KNOW I WATCHED SOME OF THE 

21:09:48 DISCUSSION FROM THE PLANNING 

21:09:51 COMMISSION, SO I'D HEARD SOME OF 

21:09:52 THE CONVERSATION PRIOR IN TERMS 

21:09:54 OF WATCHING, IN TERMS OF SOME OF 

21:09:55 THE TRAFFIC IMPROVEMENTS 

21:09:56 DISCUSSIONS AND I THINK THAT WE 

21:09:58 ALWAYS WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT WE 

21:10:00 ARE ENGAGING OF ANY OF OUR 

21:10:01 NEIGHBORING CITIES AND THAT'S 

21:10:03 WHY WHEN IT COMES TO REGIONAL 

21:10:05 JOBS THESE ARE THINGS THAT WE 

21:10:06 TRULY BELIEVE IN.

21:10:08 I'M VERY PROUD OF THE FACT AND 

21:10:10 I'M VERY HAPPY TO HEAR THAT THIS 

21:10:12 IS GOING TO BE SOLAR AND READY 

21:10:14 FOR THAT AND INCORPORATING THAT 

21:10:16 BECAUSE I THINK THAT THAT'S 

21:10:18 IMPORTANT FOR US TO HAVE THAT 

21:10:18 PROVEN BENEFIT.

21:10:20 AND I FEEL THAT THIS IS NOT THE 

21:10:21 ONLY ONE.

21:10:22 WE'VE HAD A COUPLE OF TIMES NOW 

21:10:24 WHERE I THINK BECAUSE WE HAVE 

21:10:25 HAD THESE CONVERSATIONS WITH 

21:10:27 DEVELOPERS AND OTHERS THEY'RE 

21:10:28 SEEING THAT THE COMMUNITY 

21:10:30 BENEFITS ARE IMPORTANT AND IT'S 

21:10:31 SOMETHING THAT WE VALUE.

21:10:32 THIS IS DIRECTLY IN LINE WITH 

21:10:34 SOME OF THE CONVERSATIONS I'VE 

21:10:35 BEEN HAVING THIS WEEK IN 

21:10:36 TERMINATES OF WORKFORCE 

21:10:38 DEVELOPMENT.

21:10:39 I'VE BEEN AT A CONVERSATION AND 

21:10:41 TABLE THIS PAST WEEK IN TERMS OF 

21:10:42 JOBS AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF 

21:10:44 THESE IN PARTICULAR WITH THE 

21:10:48 SECRETARY OF LABOR AND SECRETARY 

21:10:50 OF COMMERCE AND OTHER AREAS IN 

21:10:50 PARTICULAR.

21:10:52 SO I'M VERY STRONG AND FIRMLY 

21:10:53 BELIEVE IN THAT.

21:10:55 AND SO I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO 

21:10:56 THE SUPPORT OF THIS.

21:10:58 BUT I WOULD BE REMISS IN ONE OF 

21:11:00 THE THINGS, ONE FINAL ASK 

21:11:01 BECAUSE IMS WOMEN'S HISTORY 

21:11:03 MONTH AND I JUST SPENT TIME 

21:11:04 EARLIER TODAY WITH SOME 

21:11:06 COLLEAGUES AND I KNOW THAT THE 

21:11:08 PRESIDENT AND OTHERS ARE VERY 

21:11:09 SUPPORTIVE OF THIS.

21:11:11 I'D LIKE TO SEE AND HAVING BEEN 

21:11:13 INVOLVED WITH THIS IN THE PAST 

21:11:15 WITH THE ROP, WE TRY AND 

21:11:16 INCORPORATE IN PARTICULAR THE 

21:11:18 FOCUS OF DEVELOPING WOMEN 

21:11:19 INCLUDED IN THESE JOBS.

21:11:22 SO THAT WOULD BE MY ONLY OTHER 

21:11:24 FINAL ASK AS WE WORK FORWARD AND 

21:11:26 I THINK IT SOUNDS LIKE WE HAVE 

21:11:28 AN INTEREST IN MOVING THIS AND 

21:11:29 IT SOUNDS UNANIMOUS.

21:11:34 I STILL SEE A HAND RAISED FROM 

21:11:37 COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN AND VICE 

21:11:37 MAYOR SALWAN.

21:11:38 DID YOU WANT TO MAKE THE 

21:11:39 MOTIONS?

21:11:41 I SEE YOUR HANDS RAISED, 

21:11:43 COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN AND SALWAN.

21:11:48 VICE MAYOR SALWAN YOUR HAND IS 

21:11:49 STILL RAISED.

21:11:49 >> Councilmember Salwan:   I 

21:11:51 WOULD LIKE TO MAKE THE MOTION TO 

21:11:52 MOVE THIS FORWARD.

21:11:56 AND ALSO ADDING THE CONDITION OF 

21:11:59 FULLY SOLAR FROM DAY 1 AND THEN 

21:12:00 JUST AN ASK OF STAFF TO WORK

21:12:55 PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP.

21:27:42 PLAN.

21:27:44 >> I'M SUZANNE WOLF COMMUNITY 

21:27:45 SERVICES DIRECTOR.

21:27:48 IN THE LAST 27 YEARS SINT THE 

21:27:50 LAST PARKS AND RECREATION PLAN 

21:27:53 WAS ADOPTED, THE COMMUNITY SEEKS 

21:27:55 NOR TRAILS AND CONNECTIVITY IN 

21:27:56 OUR COMMUNITY.

21:28:00 PARKS SERVES AS A CHAMPION FOR 

21:28:04 CARBON SEQUESTRATION, WILDLIFE 

21:28:06 CORRIDORS, FREE PLACES FOR 

21:28:08 PHYSICAL EXERCISE IT WILL 

21:28:10 RECREATION AND PLACES OF RESPITE 

21:28:11 FOR ALL OF OUR COMMUNITY.

21:28:13 AS WE NAVIGATE THE COMPLEXITIES 

21:28:15 OF LIFE AND MENTAL HEALTH 

21:28:16 CHALLENGES PARKS ARE AVAILABLE 

21:28:19 FOR ALL AGES AND IS THE GREAT 

21:28:22 EQUALIZER FOR ALL WHO VISIT.

21:28:26 THE BODY OF WORK FOR YOU TONIGHT

21:28:33 THE THIRD TIME WE ARE BEFORE YOU 

21:28:35 AS A COUNCIL ON THIS ITEM WITH 

21:28:37 THE FINAL UPDATES.

21:28:39 THIS IS NOT A HISTORICAL ASSETS 

21:28:40 PLAN.

21:28:41 IT IS ALSO NOT A SPECIFIC PLAN 

21:28:43 FOR ANY PARTICULAR PARK AS PART 

21:28:44 OF THIS PLAN.

21:28:46 IT IS A HIGH LEVEL, 

21:28:48 COMPREHENSIVE PLAN, THAT SHOWS 

21:28:50 WHERE PARKS AND RECREATION ARE 

21:28:53 DOING WELL AND WHERE WE CAN MAKE 

21:28:54 CHANGES TO DO EVEN BETTER.

21:28:56 STAFF WOULD NEED TO RETURN TO 

21:28:58 COUNCIL WITH ANY SPECIFIC PLAN 

21:29:01 FOR ANY GIVEN PLAN LIKE WE 

21:29:03 RECENTLY DID WITH DUFT BRING 

21:29:06 NEIGHBORHOOD PARK OR THE LILA 

21:29:07 BRINGHURST NEIGHBORHOOD PARK.

21:29:09 WE WILL RETURN TO THE COUNCIL 

21:29:11 WITH ANY SPECIFIC PLAN AS WELL, 

21:29:15 BUT THAT WILL HAPPEN AFTER WE 

21:29:16 RECEIVE ELEMENTS FROM ANY 

21:29:17 POTENTIAL PARK.

21:29:19 WE ARE VERY ENCOURAGED WITH THE 

21:29:21 WORK WITH OUR PARTNERS AND OUR 

21:29:22 PARTNERSHIP IN THE COMMUNITY AND 

21:29:25 WE LOOK IN ORDER TO AHEAD WITH 

21:29:26 OUR COMMUNITY PARTNERS.

21:29:28 IT WILL TAKE ALL OF US TO BE 

21:29:29 ABLE TO IMPLEMENT WHAT'S IN OUR 

21:29:31 PLAN TODAY BEFORE YOU WITH THE 

21:29:32 COMMUNITY.

21:29:34 I'M INCREDIBLY PROUD OF THE 

21:29:36 NEARLY 4,000 RESIDENTS THAT HAVE 

21:29:38 PARTICIPATED AS THIS HAS BEEN AN 

21:29:40 INCREDIBLY INCLUSIVE PLAN.

21:29:42 THIS IS ALSO AN ACTIVE PLAN AND 

21:29:44 ONE THAT OUR STAFF MAINTAINS AND 

21:29:46 ONE THAT WE WILL UPDATE ON A 

21:29:47 REGULAR BASIS.

21:29:49 WE ANTICIPATE BRINGING UPDATES 

21:29:50 TO YOU EVERY FIVE YEARS SO THAT 

21:29:52 YOU CAN SEE OUR PROGRESS AND WE 

21:29:54 CAN MAKE CHANGES AS NEEDED.

21:29:55 WE WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT WE ARE 

21:29:56 LISTENING.

21:29:57 AND WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO TAKE A

21:30:09 AND FOR THEIR DILIGENT WORK OVER 

21:30:10 THE PAST TWO YEARS.

21:30:12 IT'S BEEN AN IMPORTANT 

21:30:13 COLLABORATIVE EFFORT.

21:30:17 IT HAS BEEN OUR PLEASURE TO WORK 

21:30:20 WITH PLANS ALL OVER THE NATION, 

21:30:21 ATLANTA, LOS ANGELES, SAN DIEGO, 

21:30:23 WE RECOGNIZE THEIR PROFESSIONAL 

21:30:26 EXPERTISE IN HELPING US CRAFT A 

21:30:28 MASTER PLAN THAT IS BEFORE YOU.

21:30:32 WITH THAT I'LL PRESENT IT OVER 

21:30:39 TO NELE BHATT.

21:30:44 >> GOOD EVENING, IT'S GREAT TO 

21:30:47 SEE YOU AGAIN AS WELL, IF I MAY 

21:30:49 HAVE PERMISSION TO SHARE MY 

21:30:49 SCREEN PLEASE.

21:30:51 CAN YOU SEE MY SCREEN?

21:30:58 YES, FANTASTIC.

21:31:00 SO SUZANNE MESSAGED ME JUST 

21:31:01 BEFORE THIS AND ASKED ME TO KEEP 

21:31:03 THIS SHORT SO I PROMISE I'LL BE 

21:31:05 DONE IN TWO HOURS.

21:31:05 I'M KIDDING.

21:31:10 >> NOT FUNNY!

21:31:13 >> Mayor Mei:   YOU CAN'T SEE MY 

21:31:14 FACE.

21:31:16 >> NO SURPRISES HERE AS SUZANNE 

21:31:19 SAID, THIS IS THE FIRST MASTER 

21:31:22 PLAN THIS CENTURY FOR FREMONT'S 

21:31:22 COMMUNITY SERVICES DEPARTMENT.

21:31:29 WE NEEDED THE LAST MASTER PLAN 

21:31:31 MARK ZUCKERBERG WAS NOT EVEN 

21:31:34 TEENAGER, ELON MUSK WAS IN HIGH 

21:31:36 SCHOOL SOMEWHERE AND PROBABLY 15 

21:31:37 O20% OF YOUR POPULATION WASN'T 

21:31:40 IN AMERICA LET ALONE IN FREMONT.

21:31:41 THAT'S HOW MUCH THE COMMUNITY 

21:31:42 HAS CHANGED.

21:31:45 SO AS WE THINK OF THE LAST 25 

21:31:47 YEARS THAT'S WHAT WE EXPECT OF 

21:31:48 FREMONT IS A COMMUNITY THAT IS 

21:31:50 ONE STEP AHEAD THAT'S LOOKING TO 

21:31:53 REINVENT AND REALLY PLAN BOLD 

21:31:55 AMBITIOUS AND INNOVATIVE AND 

21:31:58 ALSO, INCLUSIVE WAYS TO KEEP NOT 

21:32:01 THE COMMUNITY ALONE THAT'S THERE 

21:32:02 BUT TO THE ONES THAT ARE GOING 

21:32:03 TO CALL FREMONT HOME IN THE 

21:32:04 YEARS TO COME.

21:32:06 AND IT WAS REALLY COOL ACTUALLY 

21:32:07 TO SEE THIS PRESENTATION.

21:32:10 YOU HAVE A COMPANY THAT'S ALSO 

21:32:11 FROM INDIANAPOLIS LOOKING TO 

21:32:12 INVEST IN FREMONT.

21:32:14 SO HERE I AM SITTING IN 

21:32:16 INDIANAPOLIS RIGHT NOW FEELING 

21:32:17 AN EXTRA SENSE OF PRIDE WITH 

21:32:18 THIS AS WELL.

21:32:20 SO AS WE LOOK AT THIS PLAN THE 

21:32:23 LAST 20 TO 24 MONTHS, WE'VE SEEN 

21:32:25 THIS REALLY HIGH LEVEL APPROACH, 

21:32:26 WHERE ARE WE TODAY, WHERE DO WE 

21:32:28 WANT TO GO, HOW WILL WE GET 

21:32:30 THERE.

21:32:33 I MET EVERY ONE OF YOU ON ONE ON 

21:32:35 ONES AND ACROSS THE COMMUNITY, 

21:32:38 TO GET YOUR INPUT, STAFF HAS 

21:32:39 BEEN INVOLVED THROUGHOUT THE 

21:32:40 PROCESS AND YOUR COMMUNITY HAS 

21:32:42 STEPPED UP IN INCREDIBLE WAYS TO 

21:32:44 BE A PART OF THIS AND TO BE 

21:32:45 HEARD.

21:32:47 SO AS A PART OF THE PUBLIC INPUT 

21:32:50 SUZANNE SAID WE ARE OVER 3,000 

21:32:52 COMMUNITY MEMBERS PARTICIPATE IN 

21:32:53 THIS PROCESS.

21:32:56 THIS IS AND I SAY THIS WITH NO 

21:32:58 EXAGGERATION, I HAVE DONE 

21:32:59 PROBABLY OVER 200 OF THESE KINDS 

21:33:02 OF PLANS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY 

21:33:03 AND INTERNATIONALLY, I HAVE 

21:33:04 NEVER DONE OR SEEN A PLAN THAT 

21:33:05 IS MORE INCLUSIVE.

21:33:10 FROM OVER -- IN ALMOST FOUR AND 

21:33:14 A HALF THOUSAND WEBSITE USE TO 

21:33:19 CLOSE TO 2,000 ONLINE SURVEYS, 

21:33:20 VISH PUBLIC MEETINGS, WE'VE 

21:33:23 NEVER HAD THAT MANY SHOW UP FOR 

21:33:25 A PUBLIC MEETING UNLESS I'M IN 

21:33:27 SOMEBODY'S PARK OR POOL.

21:33:29 AN ADVOCATE FOR EVERYTHING 

21:33:31 INCLUDING TRAILS TO REC CENTERS 

21:33:34 TO CRICKET AND HISTORIC 

21:33:36 CORVETION AND PRESERVATION.

21:33:37 IT'S NICE TO HEAR FROM EVERYBODY 

21:33:39 AND NOT JUST IN ENGLISH AND THAT 

21:33:40 WAS JUST THE BEAUTIFUL PART OF 

21:33:42 WHAT MAKES FREMONT THE COMMUNITY 

21:33:43 IT IS.

21:33:46 THE STATISTIC SURVEY THAT WE'VE 

21:33:47 DONE, THIS IS THE FIRST TIME 

21:33:49 WE'VE ACTUALLY HAD SIX DIFFERENT 

21:33:50 LANGUAGES IN WHICH THIS WAS 

21:33:52 ADMINISTERED, ENGLISH, SPANISH, 

21:33:59 DHARI PASTO, MANDARIN AND HINDI.

21:34:01 AND IN KEEPING WITH THE 

21:34:02 CALIFORNIA SCHOOL FOR THE DEAF 

21:34:04 AND JUST A LARGE DEAF COMMUNITY 

21:34:06 WE ALSO HAD AN AMERICAN SIGN 

21:34:08 LANGUAGE INTERPRETER THAT HELPED 

21:34:10 US CONDUCT A FOCUS GROUP WITH 

21:34:11 THE MEMBERS AS WELL.

21:34:12 SO AS I THINK OF THIS PROCESS, 

21:34:15 ALONG WITH THE WEBSITE, THE 

21:34:17 FIRST APP CALLED HAPPY FEET, 

21:34:20 USED BY ANY AGENCY ON THE WEST 

21:34:27 COAST, THIS WAS VERY INNOVATIVE 

21:34:28 AND VERY, VERY INCLUSIVE.

21:34:34 WE ARE JUST FINISHING A PLAN FOR 

21:34:36 BROWARD COUNTY IN FLORIDA, THEIR 

21:34:39 POPULATION IS TEN TIMES OF 

21:34:40 YOURS, ROUGHLY 2 MILLION PEOPLE 

21:34:43 AND THEIR ENTIRE PARTICIPATION 

21:34:49 WAS 7,000, JUST ABOUT 2X THE 

21:34:50 POPULATION YOU HAVE.

21:34:52 WHICH IS WHAT GIVES US A LOT OF 

21:34:53 CONFIDENCE IN THE 

21:34:54 RECOMMENDATIONS INCLUDING THESE 

21:34:55 SURVEY RESULTS.

21:34:57 I'VE SHARED THIS ALL WITH YOU 

21:34:58 EARLIER BUT EVERYTHING FROM 

21:35:01 TRAILS AND CONNECTIVITY, SMALL 

21:35:02 AND LARGE PARKS, COMMUNITY 

21:35:06 CENTER, OPEN SPACE CONSERVATION, 

21:35:08 ET CETERA, WERE HIGH PRIORITIES 

21:35:11 BASED ON THE STATISTICALLY VALID 

21:35:12 SURVEY.

21:35:14 AND PROGRAMMATICALLY TOO, YOU 

21:35:19 HAVE A GROWING ADULT POPULATION, 

21:35:23 SENIOR FITNESS AND WELLNESS, 

21:35:25 WERE ALSO VERY HIGH PRIORITIES.

21:35:27 BY WAY OF ASSESSMENTS, THIS IS 

21:35:29 THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE 

21:35:30 ASSESSMENT AND IN TERMS OF 

21:35:33 GATHERING ALL YOUR INPUT IN ONE 

21:35:40 PLACE, WITH OUR PARTNERS, EVERY 

21:35:42 SINGLE ONE OF OUR PARKS AND 

21:35:43 EVERY ASSET WAS INVENTORIED FOR 

21:35:46 THE FIRST TIME BASED ON GPS 

21:35:47 LOCATIONS NOW AS WELL, STAFF 

21:35:49 ACTUALLY KNOWS WHAT YOU HAVE IN 

21:35:51 EVERY SINGLE PARK, WHERE THEY 

21:35:54 ARE LOCATED AND THEY'RE CFNED AT 

21:35:56 A POINT IN TIME SO YOU CAN 

21:35:57 PROACTIVELY MANAGE THIS GOING 

21:35:59 FORWARD AND THEN AS PART OF OUR 

21:36:01 WORK WITH MY COLLEAGUE AS WELL 

21:36:04 AND THE FORMER PARKS ANSWER 

21:36:06 RECREATION DIRECTOR, PHILLIP 

21:36:10 HARNAN, FROM A MAINTENANCE AND 

21:36:12 OPERATIONS STANDPOINT, WHAT ARE 

21:36:15 THE STANDARDS WE NEED, WHAT ARE 

21:36:16 STAFFING LEVELS SO AS THE SYSTEM 

21:36:18 GROWS AS YOU BUILD MORE YOU'RE 

21:36:20 NOT JUST PLANNING FOR THE 

21:36:21 CAPITAL SIDE, YOU'RE ALSO 

21:36:22 PLANNING FOR THE LONG TERM 

21:36:23 OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE 

21:36:25 ASPECT OF IT.

21:36:26 YOU KNOW, ONE OF THE THINGS A 

21:36:28 NUMBER OF YOU SAID AS WELL WHEN 

21:36:30 WE TALKED ABOUT THIS AND MAYOR 

21:36:32 MEI YOU MENTIONED THIS TO ME 

21:36:34 SPECIFICALLY EARLY ON TOO, WAS 

21:36:36 ONE OF THE PRIORITIES WAS EQUITY 

21:36:38 OF ACCESS.

21:36:38 VICE MAYOR SALWAN YOU ALSO 

21:36:40 MENTIONED LOOKING TO CONNECT THE 

21:36:41 SOUTH SIDE AS WELL AND THE 

21:36:42 ENTIRE CITY.

21:36:43 AND SO AS WE WENT THROUGH THIS 

21:36:46 PROCESS ONE OF THE KEY THINGS WE 

21:36:47 DEVELOPED WERE WHAT WE CALL 

21:36:49 EQUITY MAPS.

21:36:51 THIS IS LOOKING AT THE INVENTORY 

21:36:53 PROVIDED BY A NUMBER OF 

21:36:53 DIFFERENT PROVIDERS, FROM THE 

21:36:56 CITY TO EAST BAY, TO SCHOOLS AND 

21:36:58 SO ON.

21:37:00 FOR EACH ASSET AND AMENITY TYPE 

21:37:02 TO BE ABLE TO SHOW WHERE THERE 

21:37:03 ARE GAPS AND OVERLAPS.

21:37:05 WE CAN SEE WHERE WE'RE WELL 

21:37:07 SERVED WITH COMMUNITY PARKS 

21:37:09 INCLUDING THE HISTORIC ONES AND 

21:37:10 CLEARLY ON THE RIGHT YOU CAN SEE 

21:37:11 WHERE THERE ARE SIGNIFICANCE FOR 

21:37:14 PICKLE BALL COURTS AMONG OTHER 

21:37:15 AMEANT.

21:37:17 SO THIS ALLOWS STAFF TO MAKE 

21:37:19 MUCH MORE OBJECTIVE AND DATA 

21:37:22 DRIVEN DECISIONS, TO MAXIMIZE 

21:37:24 ACCESS WHETHER IT'S A TEN MINUTE 

21:37:26 WALK TO A PARK OR ANY KIND OF 

21:37:27 AMENITY OR PARK THAT THEY MAY 

21:37:29 HAVE AS WELL.

21:37:30 ULTIMATELY ALL THIS LED TO THE 

21:37:32 VISIONING TO SAY IN LIGHT OF 

21:37:33 WHERE THE CITY IS WHERE WE'RE 

21:37:35 GOING FROM A FUTURE TREND 

21:37:36 STANDPOINT, WHAT THE COMMUNITY'S 

21:37:37 VISION AND VALUES ARE, WHAT IS 

21:37:39 IT THAT WE WANT TO DEVELOP?

21:37:41 SO EARLIER THIS YEAR, AFTER 

21:37:43 ALMOST 18 MONTHS, WE ALL GOT 

21:37:46 TOGETHER IN PERSON, STAFF SPENT 

21:37:48 AN ENTIRE DAY COMMUNITY 

21:37:49 SERVICES, WE ALSO HAD SOME STAFF 

21:37:50 FROM HUMAN SERVICES PARTICIPATE 

21:37:52 IN THIS, TO BE ABLE TO GET A 

21:37:54 SENSE OF WHAT ARE THE CORE 

21:37:55 VALUES, THE VISION MISSION, AND 

21:37:58 SOME KEY BIG MOVES AND 

21:38:00 STRATEGIES FOR THE FUTURE.

21:38:02 SO LEADING WITH THE VALUES, THIS 

21:38:04 IS WHAT THE STAFF IDENTIFIED AS 

21:38:06 THE CORE VALUES FOR THE 

21:38:09 DEPARTMENT, GOING FORWARD:  

21:38:11 EXCELLENCE, INCLUSION, 

21:38:12 INNOVATION AND SUSTAINABILITY.

21:38:16 LOOKING AT BUILDING FURTHER UPON 

21:38:19 THIS, IN TERMS OF THE VISION, 

21:38:20 WHAT DO WE WANT TO BE GOING 

21:38:21 FORWARD?

21:38:23 WHAT DO WE WANT TO BE KNOWN FOR?

21:38:25 WE WANT TO BE THE REASON PEOPLE 

21:38:27 WANT TO LIVE, WORK AND PLAY IN 

21:38:28 FREMONT.

21:38:32 WE IMPACT LIVES AT EVERY LEVEL.

21:38:34 I THINK IF ANYTHING WE'VE SEEN 

21:38:35 THROUGH PANDEMIC THIS IS NOT 

21:38:38 JUST A NICE TO HAVE, THIS IS 

21:38:41 ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL FOR THE 

21:38:43 PHYSICAL MEDICAL EMOTIONAL WELT 

21:38:45 BEING AND QUALITY OF LIFE 

21:38:46 STANDPOINT AND THAT'S WHAT THE 

21:38:48 COMMUNITY SERVICES COMPARTMENT 

21:38:49 STRIVES TO DO AND THE WAY THEY 

21:38:51 WOULD DO IT EVERY SINGLE DAY IS 

21:38:53 PROVIDING EXCEPTIONAL COMMUNITY 

21:38:54 EXPERIENCES.

21:38:56 WHETHER IT'S CULTURAL EVENTS, 

21:38:57 WHETHER IT'S WALKING YOUR DOG, 

21:39:00 WHETHER IT'S PLAYING IN A SPORT, 

21:39:02 WHETHER IT'S SIMPLY BEING OUT 

21:39:04 THERE IN THE PARK BY YOURSELF, 

21:39:05 EACH ONE OF THEM IS AN 

21:39:07 EXPERIENCE WITH COMMUNITY IN 

21:39:09 MIND AND THE FREMONT WAY IS 

21:39:10 EITHER THE BEST AND THE MOST 

21:39:12 EXCEPTIONAL OR NOTHING AT ALL.

21:39:15 AND THAT'S THE STANDARD STAFF 

21:39:19 HAS APPLIED US TO.

21:39:22 LET'S CREATE AN AMBITIOUS VISION 

21:39:23 THAT TEN YEARS FROM NOW, 15 

21:39:25 YEARS FROM NOW, IF YOU LOOK 

21:39:26 BACK, WHAT ARE THOSE BIG MOVES 

21:39:28 THAT EACH OF YOU AS STAFF AND 

21:39:34 EACH OF YOU AS ELECTED MEMBERS 

21:39:35 AND LEADERS IN THE COMMUNITY 

21:39:37 WILL LOOK BACK AND SAY THIS WAS 

21:39:39 A GREAT LEGACY OF THIS MASTER 

21:39:41 PLAN.

21:39:42 AND SO THESE WERE THESE BIG 

21:39:43 MOVES.

21:39:45 A TEN MINUTE WALK TO A PARK 

21:39:46 ACCESS FOR ALL.

21:39:47 EVERY PERSON IN FREMONT SHOULD 

21:39:49 HAVE ACCESS TO A PARK WITHIN A 

21:39:51 TEN MINUTE WALK.

21:39:54 VICE MAYOR SALWAN AS WELL, AND 

21:39:55 COUNCILMEMBER JONES, YOU'D 

21:39:57 MENTIONED AS WELL, LOOKING AT 

21:39:59 MULTIGENERATIONAL, MULTIUSE REC 

21:40:00 CENTERS AND FACILITIES AS WELL 

21:40:02 AS LOOKING FOR PARTNERSHIPS AND 

21:40:04 PUBLIC, PRIVATE AND WHERE WE CAN 

21:40:05 LOOK AT DEVELOPING THOSE TOO.

21:40:07 THAT'S WHERE THE SECOND ONE AND 

21:40:09 THEN FOURTH ONE IN TERMS OF 

21:40:11 FUNDING SOURCES WERE VERY 

21:40:11 CRITICAL.

21:40:13 WE HAVE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S 

21:40:14 AGING FROM WHAT WE'VE SEEN AS 

21:40:15 WELL.

21:40:17 A LOT OF PRIORITY THE COMMUNITY 

21:40:20 HAS.

21:40:21 TAKING CARE OF WHAT YOU HAVE OR 

21:40:24 UPDATE AND EXPAND THAT WHETHER 

21:40:25 IT'S RESTROOMS AND SHADE 

21:40:27 STRUCTURES OR SPORTS FACILITIES 

21:40:27 AND INFRASTRUCTURE.

21:40:30 YOU HAVE EXISTING FUNDING 

21:40:32 SOURCES, YOUR RECREATION STAFF 

21:40:33 IS PROBABLY THE BEST IN THE 

21:40:35 COUNTRY THAT I'VE SEEN.

21:40:37 IN TERMS OF REVENUE GENERATION 

21:40:39 AND MAXIMIZING THE VALUE FOR 

21:40:40 WHAT THEY PROVIDE.

21:40:42 SO THERE'S LIMITED ROOM FOR 

21:40:43 GROWTH THERE.

21:40:45 YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DO 

21:40:46 THINGS YOU MAY NOT HAVE DONE 

21:40:48 BEFORE IF YOU WANT TO ACHIEVE 

21:40:49 OUTCOMES YOU HAVEN'T ACHIEVED 

21:40:50 BEFORE AND THAT INCLUDES 

21:40:53 EVERYTHING FROM A FOUNDATION, A 

21:40:55 501(C)3 TO SUPPORT YOU, TO ALSO 

21:40:57 LOOKING AT LONGER-TERM 

21:40:58 PARTNERSHIPS, A BOND OR 

21:41:00 REFERENDUM OR EVEN SALES TAX 

21:41:01 MEASURES WHICH IS WHAT CITIES 

21:41:04 ARE DOING FOR AMBITIOUS, LONG 

21:41:05 TERM IMPROVEMENTS AND INVESTMENT 

21:41:07 IN THE SYSTEM.

21:41:09 AND THEN, AS YOU GROW AND DO ALL 

21:41:11 OF THESE, IT'S GOING TO TAKE 

21:41:13 ADDITIONAL RESOURCES INTERNALLY 

21:41:15 AS WELL TO KEEP UP WITH THIS 

21:41:17 INCREASED LEVEL OF SERVICE.

21:41:18 SO IT'S PROBABLY A COMBINATION 

21:41:20 OF INCREASED STAFFING, TRAINING 

21:41:23 AND DEVELOPMENT, AND WHERE 

21:41:24 APPROPRIATE, CONTRACT SUPPORT AS 

21:41:26 WELL, TO MEET THE FUTURE LEVELS 

21:41:28 OF SERVICE.

21:41:30 SO IT IS THIS ENTIRELY HOLISTIC 

21:41:32 APPROACH IN TERMS OF A TEN 

21:41:35 MINUTE WALK ACCESS, YEAR-ROUND 

21:41:38 MULTIGENERATIONAL, MULTIPURPOSE 

21:41:41 RECREATION SPACES, UPDATING 

21:41:43 EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE, ADDING 

21:41:44 NEW INFRASTRUCTURE, FINDING WAYS 

21:41:47 TO FUND IT AND THEN ENSURING 

21:41:48 YOU'RE ADEQUATELY STAFFED.

21:41:51 SO BREAKING THIS VISION DOWN 

21:41:54 INTO MORE CONCRETE ACTION PLANS 

21:41:56 IS EXACTLY WHAT THE NEXT FOUR OR 

21:41:57 FIVE SLIDES ARE ABOUT.

21:41:59 HOW DO WE LOOK AT THESE IN A 

21:42:01 SHORT MADE LONG TERM AND THEN 

21:42:02 ONGOING BASIS AS WELL.

21:42:05 SO SUZANNE SAID THIS EARLIER.

21:42:07 I CANNOT EMPHASIZE THIS ENOUGH.

21:42:09 THIS IS A LIVING DOCUMENT.

21:42:12 WHEN WE HAD THE PLAN WITH 50 OF 

21:42:14 YOUR STAFF IN DECEMBER 2019, WE 

21:42:16 COULD NOT IMAGINE HOW MUCH THE 

21:42:17 WORLD WOULD CHANGE IN THREE 

21:42:17 MONTHS.

21:42:19 SO THIS HAS TO BE A PLAN THAT IS 

21:42:21  

21:42:24 DYNAMIC, THAT CONTINUES TO 

21:42:25 REFLECT EXISTING REALITIES AND 

21:42:25 CHANGES.

21:42:27 SO I SHARE THE FOLLOWING 

21:42:29 STRATEGIES WITH YOU KEEPING THAT 

21:42:32 LIVING DOCUMENT VERSION IN MIND.

21:42:34 SO NIECE ARE THE FUNDING SOURCES 

21:42:35 WE TALKED ABOUT.

21:42:37 CITY DOES AGAIN A REALLY GOOD 

21:42:38 JOB IN A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT 

21:42:39 WAYS.

21:42:42 FROM GENERAL REVENUES FEES 

21:42:44 GRANTS TO OTHER SPECIAL TAXES.

21:42:45 WE NEED TO LOOK AT OTHER 

21:42:46 ADDITIONAL OPTIONS AS WELL AS 

21:42:48 GROWING WHAT WE HAVE AS WELL, IF 

21:42:51 WE ARE TO SUSTAIN THE SYSTEM, 

21:42:52 AND GROW THE SYSTEM FOR THE 

21:42:54 FUTURE.

21:42:55 AND THESE ARE WHAT THE 

21:42:58 STRATEGIES LOOK LIKE.

21:43:00 DOG PARKS, YOU SAW THE EQUITY 

21:43:03 MAP FOR PICKLE BALL AS WELL, 

21:43:05 OUTSIDE OF CENTRAL PARK RITE NOW 

21:43:06 YOU DON'T HAVE A DOG PARK OR 

21:43:12 PICKLE BALL LOCATION, SPEAKING 

21:43:14 OF UNDERSERVED LOCATIONS, 

21:43:16 NEIGHBORHOOD PARKS AS WELL, I 

21:43:19 MENTIONED THE 501(C)3 OF PARKS 

21:43:22 AND RECREATION, TO EXPLORING THE 

21:43:24 POSSIBILITY OF SUPPORT FOR A 

21:43:26 BOND REFERENDUM OR SALES TAX.

21:43:28 WE NEED TO CONTINUE REQUIRING 

21:43:30  

21:43:31 LAND FOR UNDERSERVED AREAS TO 

21:43:35 MEET THE LARGER VISION AND THAT 

21:43:38  

21:43:41 UNIVERSALLY ACCESSIBLE TO 

21:43:44  CREACT 

21:43:48  

21:43:50 RECREATE THROUGHOUT THE YEAR.

21:43:52 PARKS YOU CAN LEVERAGE AT 

21:43:53 PACIFIC COMMONS SPORTS PARK AS 

21:43:55 WELL, FROM KITCHEN AND PASSIVE 

21:43:58 SPACES TRAILS TO CRICKET, PICKLE 

21:44:01 BALL AND INDOOR OUTDOOR 

21:44:02 RECREATION FACILITIES, THE 

21:44:04 HISTORICAL COMPONENT CAME UP 

21:44:05 REALLY HIGH AS WELL, THERE IS A 

21:44:07 DESIRE TO PRESERVE AND SHARE THE 

21:44:09 CULTURAL HERITAGE AND MAKE THEM 

21:44:11 MORE FOR DESTINATIONS AS WELL OF 

21:44:15 WHAT FREMONT WAS AND SO CONTINUE 

21:44:16 BUILDING ON THAT WITH OUR 

21:44:17 HISTORICAL PARKS.

21:44:18 YOU ALREADY HEARD ME TALK ABOUT 

21:44:20 THE EXISTING REC CENTERS AND 

21:44:20 COMMUNITY CENTERS.

21:44:24 WE ARE WOEFULLY INADEQUATE WITH 

21:44:26 OUR INDOOR RECREATION CENTER 

21:44:27 SPACE CURRENTLY FOR THE 

21:44:29 POPULATION WE HAVE.

21:44:31 NOR IS IT EQUIPPED TO BE A 

21:44:33 MULTIGENERATIONAL SPACE AND IN 

21:44:35 TODAY'S TIMES THAT'S WHAT 

21:44:36 COMMUNITIES WANT IS FOR 

21:44:38 TEENAGERS, FAMILIES, ACTIVE 

21:44:39 ADULTS, TO ALL COME TOGETHER AS 

21:44:42 PART OF COMMUNITY UNDER ONE 

21:44:42 ROOF.

21:44:45 AND THEN YOU HAVE AN ACTIVE 

21:44:47 ADULT COMMUNITY.

21:44:50 SO WHAT ARE MORE OF THOSE 

21:44:52 TRENDING LEISURE ACTIVITIES, 

21:44:53 SIX, SEARCH YEARS AGO I BARELY 

21:44:55 HEARD OF A SPORT CALLED PICKLE 

21:44:57 BALL, TODAY IT'S THE FASTEST 

21:44:58 GROWING SPORT IN THE COUNTRY.

21:45:01 SO WHAT MIGHT THOSE OTHER 

21:45:03 TRENDING LEISURE ACTIVITIES, 

21:45:05 THOSE REMAIN TO BE SEEN BUT 

21:45:11 CONTINUE TO EVOLVE TO GET THAT, 

21:45:12 ONE OF THE GOALS THE DEPARTMENT 

21:45:14 HAS ASPIRED TO, EVERY FIVE YEARS 

21:45:16 YOU OUGHT TO UPDATE YOUR MASTER 

21:45:16 PLAN.

21:45:18 SO WHAT WE ARE ABOUT TO SHOW YOU 

21:45:19 NOW IN THE LONG TERM, REALLY, AT 

21:45:21 THE TIME OF YOUR FIVE YEAR 

21:45:23 MASTER PLAN UPDATE, BECOMES YOUR 

21:45:24 NEAR TERM.

21:45:24 RIGHT?

21:45:28 AND THAT'S WHERE THE NEW 

21:45:31 MULTIGEN, MULTIPURPOSE 

21:45:34 RECREATION CENTER, CONTINUE TO 

21:45:37 ADD RESTROOMS WHERE APPROPRIATE, 

21:45:38 ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY AND 

21:45:40 MAXIMIZING ACCESS AND TRAIL 

21:45:41 CONNECTIVITY THROUGH EXISTING 

21:45:44 AND FUTURE PARK LANDS, CITYWIDE, 

21:45:46 IS GOING TO BE CRITICAL.

21:45:47 LASTLY.

21:45:49 THESE ARE SOME OF THE ONGOING 

21:45:50 PIECES AS WELL.

21:45:51 SHADE.

21:45:53 YOU KNOW AS TEMPERATURES RISE AS 

21:45:56 WELL, AS PEOPLE SPEND MORE TIME 

21:45:59 OUTSIDE, SHADE STRUCTURES, 

21:46:01 PLANTING NEXT GENERATION TREES, 

21:46:03 RESTROOMS, ALL OF THOSE 

21:46:04 AMENITIES WERE REALLY IMPORTANT.

21:46:06 MORE INTERNALLY AS WELL, LOOKING 

21:46:08 AT FEES AND CHARGES REVIEWS, KEY 

21:46:10 PERFORMANCE METRICS, CONTINUE TO 

21:46:12 BUILD UPON YOUR MARKETING YOUR 

21:46:13 BRAND AND STORY TELLING IS 

21:46:14 IMPORTANT.

21:46:16 REVIEWING POLICY PROCEDURES AND 

21:46:18 THEN AS YOU DO COMMUNICATE AND 

21:46:20 CREATE THE SOCIAL MEDIA ASPECTS 

21:46:24 AS WELL, TO BE ABLE TO HAVE 

21:46:27 THOSE ANALYTICS TO ASSESS NEW 

21:46:31 ONCE TOO, KIM BARONIC, THE NEW 

21:46:35 COMMUNITY DIRECTOR'S SON IS A 

21:46:37 TIKTOK USER, THAT WASN'T EVEN 

21:46:39 PART OF SOCIAL MEDIA TO RENEW 

21:46:40 THREE YEARS AGO.

21:46:42 HOW DO WE TELL OUR STORY ON AN 

21:46:43 ONGOING BASIS SO THAT PEOPLE 

21:46:45 KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE AND THE 

21:46:46 RICHNESS OF ALL THE OFFERINGS 

21:46:47 AND AS NEW PEOPLE CONTINUE 

21:46:50 MOVING TO FREMONT, THEY ALL 

21:46:51 UNDERSTAND AND VALUE AND 

21:46:53 APPRECIATE WHAT YOU AS A CITY 

21:46:54 PROVIDE AND HAVE CONTINUED TO 

21:46:56 PROVIDE AS WELL.

21:46:58 SO WITH THAT, I WILL TAKE A 

21:47:04 PAUSE RIGHT HERE AND I -- NEXT 

21:47:06 STEPS AS WE MENTION OBVIOUSLY 

21:47:08 WANT TO LOOK LIKE, CONSIDER 

21:47:09 ADOPTING THE PLAN AND THEN 

21:47:12 REALLY THE IMPLEMENTATION TO 

21:47:14 BEGIN.

21:47:17 SO I AM GOING TO STOP SHARING MY 

21:47:18 SCREEN, HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS 

21:47:20 AND COMMENTS THAT YOU MAY HAVE 

21:47:20 AS WELL.

21:47:22 >> Mayor Mei:   SO AT THIS TIME 

21:47:23 I JUST WANTED TO CHECK IF THERE 

21:47:30 ARE ANY CLARIFYING QUESTIONS?

21:47:31 VICE MAYOR SALWAN.

21:47:37 >> Councilmember Salwan:   I 

21:47:41 GUESS ARE COMMENTS OKAY TOO?

21:47:42 >> Mayor Mei:   SURE BECAUSE I 

21:47:44 THINK I WANTED TO -- I THINK WE 

21:47:46 HAVE TO OPEN UP THE PUBLIC 

21:47:48 COMMENT PERIOD AS WELL.

21:47:50 >> Councilmember Salwan:   I 

21:47:52 WANTED TO -- OKAY.

21:47:53 SORRY IT'S TREEING, I DON'T KNOW 

21:47:56 IF IT'S ON MY END OR YOUR END.

21:47:57 >> Mayor Mei:   IT'S YOUR END I 

21:47:59 GUESS BECAUSE I KEEP WONDERING 

21:48:00 BECAUSE YOU STOPPED.

21:48:06 >> Councilmember Salwan:   OKAY, 

21:48:08 LET MOW TRY WITHOUT THE VIDEO, 

21:48:10 CAN YOU HEAR ME?

21:48:13 >> The Clerk:   YES WE CAN.

21:48:13 >> Councilmember Salwan:   I 

21:48:15 JUST WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE 

21:48:16 EFFORT THAT YOU HAVE TAKEN TO 

21:48:17 BRING THIS TOGETHER.

21:48:20 SO ONE OF THE -- I KNOW A LOT OF 

21:48:22 THIS IS LIKE HIGH LEVEL 

21:48:24 STRATEGIC THINKING AND SO.

21:48:25 BUT SOME OF THE KIND OF ON THE 

21:48:27 GROUND THINGS THAT WE HEAR.

21:48:28 WE HAVE A LOT OF FOLKS FOR 

21:48:29 EXAMPLE THAT ARE INTERESTED IN 

21:48:30 CRICKET.

21:48:33 AND SO, YOU KNOW, WE HAVE BEEN 

21:48:34 TALKING ABOUT IT FOR QUITE SOME 

21:48:35 TIME NOW.

21:48:37 AND A LOT OF THE COMMUNITY WANTS 

21:48:41 TO SEE SOME TANGIBLE RESULTS AS 

21:48:42 FAR AS ANY SPECIFIC PLACES THAT 

21:48:44 WE CAN PARTNER WITH THEM OR WE 

21:48:47 CAN LEASE TO THEM OR, YOU KNOW, 

21:48:49 SOME SORT OF CREATIVE SOLUTION 

21:48:50 WHERE IT CAN BE A WIN WIN WIN 

21:48:52 FOR THE COMMUNITY.

21:48:55 YOU KNOW AS THE DEMOGRAPHICS 

21:49:00 CHANGES, THE NEEDS CHANGE AS 

21:49:05 THIS PAST SUNDAY I THREW THE 

21:49:10 FIRST PITCH, BASEBALL WAS IN THE 

21:49:12 AS POPULAR AS IT ONCE WAS AND 

21:49:14 HOUSE THE CRICKET LEAGUES WERE 

21:49:14 TAKING OFF.

21:49:16 SO I THINK THERE IS DEFINITELY A 

21:49:18 NEED WITHIN THE COMMUNITY AND I 

21:49:20 LIKE TO SEE SOMETHING TANGIBLE 

21:49:22 ADDRESSED IN SOME OF THESE 

21:49:23 DOCUMENTS THAT CAN CAPTURE THAT 

21:49:24 AND TAKE SOME OF THAT PASSION 

21:49:25 AND ENERGY THAT SOME FOLKS HAVE 

21:49:32 IN THIS AND MANY OTHERS, I THINK 

21:49:34 WE NEED TO TAKE SOME TANGIBLE 

21:49:35 STEPS TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN.

21:49:36 AND ALSO I APPRECIATE THE ISSUE 

21:49:38 ABOUT DOG PARKS.

21:49:39 I THINK THE ONE WE HAVE GETS 

21:49:41 QUITE HEAVILY TRAFFICKED AND 

21:49:43 WE'RE A VERY LARGE CITY.

21:49:46 AND SO DEFINITELY, WE COULD USE 

21:49:47 SOME AT THE NORTH AND SOUTH AND 

21:49:48 KIND OF SPREAD IT OUT.

21:49:50 IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE A FANCY 

21:49:52 DOG PARK BUT MIGHT BE OTHER 

21:49:54 OUTLETS WHERE PEOPLE CAN LET 

21:49:55 THEIR DOGS RUN AROUND AND BE 

21:49:57 ABLE TO SOCIALIZE AND GET THEIR 

21:49:58 EXERCISE.

21:49:59 I THINK YOU MENTIONED A LOT OF 

21:50:01 THE OTHER POINTS WHICH I THINK 

21:50:03 ARE GOOD AS FAR AS UPGRADING OUR 

21:50:03 FACILITIES.

21:50:06 WE HAVE A LOT OF VERY OUTDATED 

21:50:07 FACILITIES THAT STILL LOOK LIKE 

21:50:09 THEY'RE FROM THE 60S OR 70s.

21:50:11 AND SO HOPEFULLY WE CAN AS WE 

21:50:14 GET MORE FUNDING WE CAN START 

21:50:16 UPGRADING THEM.

21:50:19 AND THEN -- WELL I THINK I'LL 

21:50:20 LEAVE IT AT THAT.

21:50:21 SO IF I HAVE MORE I'LL COME 

21:50:23 BACK, I'LL LEAVE IT TO THE OTHER 

21:50:24 FOLKS HERE.

21:50:24 THANK YOU.

21:50:29 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

21:50:32 NEXT IS COUNCILMEMBER SHAO.

21:50:32 >> Councilmember Shao:   THANK 

21:50:34 YOU, MADAM MAYOR.

21:50:38 THANK YOU,NEELY FOR A VERY GOOD 

21:50:40 PRESENTATION.

21:50:42 ESPECIALLY WHEN I SEE FOR SHORT 

21:50:46 TERM WE ADD MORE DOG PARKS AND 

21:50:46  

21:50:49 PICKLE BAR COURTS.

21:50:51 WHAT I GOT FROM MY DISTRICT IN 

21:50:52 TERMS OF FEEDBACK IS THAT RIGHT 

21:50:56 NOW, WE'RE IN GREAT NEED OF SUCH 

21:51:00 DOG PARKS TO A POINT WHERE 

21:51:02 PEOPLE ARE JUST NO LONGER 

21:51:05 ABIDING BY THE DOG ON LEASH 

21:51:09 POLICIES, AND USING THE REGULAR 

21:51:11 PARKS AS DOG PARKS.

21:51:13 WHICH WOULD CAUSE A LOT OF 

21:51:16 TROUBLE FOR SOME OF THE 

21:51:17 RESIDENTS WHO WOULD LIKE TO 

21:51:21 ENJOY THE SAFETY OF THE PARK.

21:51:25  

21:51:26 ESPECIALLY WHEN SMALL CHILDREN 

21:51:27 ARE AROUND.

21:51:30 MY QUESTION IS TO DIRECTOR 

21:51:31 SUZANNE WOLF.

21:51:34 WHILE WE ARE ADOPTING NEW MASTER 

21:51:38 PLANS AND IMPLEMENTING THE PLAN, 

21:51:41 HOW DO YOU BALANCE, IN THE 

21:51:43 MEANTIME, THE ADDITION OF DOG 

21:51:47 PARKS AND THE ENFORCEMENT OF DOG 

21:51:50 ON LEASH POLICIES IN OUR CURRENT 

21:51:52 PARKS?

21:51:55 >> THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION 

21:51:56 COUNCILMEMBER SHAO.

21:51:58 THE DOG PARK, CURRENTLY THE 

21:52:00 LEASH POLICY IS JOINTLY ENFORCED 

21:52:02 BY THE POLICE DEPARTMENT AND 

21:52:03 ANIMAL SERVICES AND OUR 

21:52:05 COMMUNITY SERVICES PARK RANGERS.

21:52:09 BUT SINCE THE EARLY 2000, PARKS 

21:52:11 OUTSIDE OF CENTRAL PARK ARE NOT 

21:52:14 ACTIVELY PATROLLED BY OUR PARK 

21:52:17 RANGERS, WE TRY TO MINIMIZE OUR 

21:52:19 PARK RANGERS OUT WITHOUT 

21:52:20 SPECIFIC INFORMATION ON DATES 

21:52:21 AND TIMES.

21:52:22 SO IN OUR EXPERIENCE MOST OF 

21:52:24 THESE TYPES OF CALLS THAT ARE 

21:52:24 RECEIVED BY THE POLICE 

21:52:27 DEPARTMENT HAVE A LOW PRIORITY 

21:52:29 ORDER, OR PRIORITY RATING, FROM 

21:52:31 THE POLICE DEPARTMENT.

21:52:34 SO A DOG PARK WOULD ALLOW FOR 

21:52:36 DOGS TO BE OFF LEASH IN AN AREA 

21:52:38 THAT WOULD BE SECURE, IN AN AREA 

21:52:40 THAT PEOPLE WOULD SEE OFTENTIMES 

21:52:42 YOU SEE SMALL DOG AREAS AND 

21:52:44 LARGE DOG AREAS FOR DOG PARKS 

21:52:45 AND THEY WOULD THEN HAVE A 

21:52:47 SECURE AREA TO BE IN AND A SAFE 

21:52:47 PLACE TO BE IN.

21:52:49 AND THEN PEOPLE ARE LESS LIKELY 

21:52:51 TO THEN LET THEIR DOGS GO 

21:52:52 OFF-LEASH.

21:52:56 DOG PARKS HAVE -- PEOPLE ARE 

21:52:58 VERY PROTECTIVE OF THEIR DOGS 

21:53:00 AND BELIEVE THAT THEIR DOGS OFF 

21:53:01 LEASH AREN'T GOING TO CAUSE A 

21:53:03 PROBLEM BUT WE DO KNOW IN MANY 

21:53:04 AREAS THAT IS NOT ALWAYS THE 

21:53:05 CASE.

21:53:07 AND SO IT IS A GOOD REMINDER TO 

21:53:08 REMIND OUR COMMUNITY THIS 

21:53:11 EVENING THAT DOGS ARE REQUIRED 

21:53:13 TO BE ON LEASH IN FREMONT AND 

21:53:15 THAT IS OUR CURRENT MUNICIPAL 

21:53:20 CODE THAT IS ENFORCEABLE.

21:53:23 WE TRY TO DO THAT BY EDUCATION 

21:53:25 FIRST AND FOREMOST AND THEN 

21:53:28 FOLLOWING WE TRY TO FIND WAYS TO 

21:53:31 ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO USE LEASHES 

21:53:32 OUTDOORS.

21:53:34 WE KNOW THAT OUR FURRY FRIENDS 

21:53:36 ARE ALSO AN EMOTIONAL SUPPORT 

21:53:38 THAT IS IMPORTANT FOR OUR 

21:53:40 EMOTIONAL HEALTH AND WELL-BEING 

21:53:42 AS WELL SO THANK YOU FOR THAT 

21:53:43 QUESTION.

21:53:43 >> Councilmember Shao:   THANK 

21:53:44 YOU.

21:53:45 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU, 

21:53:46 COUNCILMEMBER KENG.

21:53:47 >> Councilmember Keng:   THANK 

21:53:48 YOU MADAM MAYOR.

21:53:50 FIRST I WANT TO APPRECIATE OUR 

21:53:52 DIRECTOR SUZANNE WOLF AND OTHER 

21:53:54 STAFF AS WELL AS OUR CONSULTING 

21:53:55 FIRM MAYBING EVERYTHING HAPPEN 

21:53:59 IN THE LAST MAYBE WITHIN A YEAR 

21:54:02 AND HAVING PARTICIPATION FROM 

21:54:03 OUR RESIDENTS.

21:54:05 SO I HAVE -- I DO HAVE A 

21:54:07 QUESTION REGARDING THE SHORT 

21:54:09 TERM PLANS TO START WITH.

21:54:12 DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH OF THE 

21:54:14 NEEDED -- NECESSARY FUNDING HAVE 

21:54:17 WE SECURED TO MAKE THESE PLANS 

21:54:18 HAPPEN?

21:54:21 BECAUSE IT'S COMING UP PRETTY 

21:54:23 QUICKLY, ZERO TO TWO YEARS, 

21:54:23 THANK YOU.

21:54:27 >> I WOULD ADD THAT THE SHORT 

21:54:28 TERM PLANS WOULD BE SOMETHING WE 

21:54:31 WOULD LOOK AT IN OUR NEXT CIP 

21:54:32 PROCESS WHICH WOULD BE COMING UP 

21:54:34 THIS NEXT YEAR IN TERMS OF THE 

21:54:35 CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS.

21:54:37 MANY OF THESE ITEMS ARE LED BY 

21:54:38 STAFF ALSO JUST THINKING ABOUT 

21:54:40 POLICIES AND PROCEDURES.

21:54:42 AND THEN ALSO, WE REALLY WANT TO 

21:54:47 FOCUS ON A FOUNDATION FIRST AND 

21:54:50 FOREMOST, TO COME BARK TO THE 

21:54:51 COMMUNITY AND LOOK AT THAT 

21:54:53 PRIVATE FUNDRAISING.

21:54:54 COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN HAS REALLY 

21:54:57 LED THE EFFORTS HELPING US THINK 

21:55:00 OF THE WAYS TO ASK INDIVIDUALS 

21:55:03 FOR FUNDING, AND FUND RAISINGS 

21:55:05 ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS BUT WE 

21:55:06 NEED A FOUNDATION TO HELP US ON 

21:55:08 THAT FOCUSED FUNDRAISING FOR 

21:55:09 PARKS AND RECREATION PURPOSES 

21:55:11 AND I THINK THAT WOULD HELP US 

21:55:13 WITH OUR PARTNERSHIP MODEL AS 

21:55:15 WELL, WE CAN THEN FOCUS 

21:55:16 FUNDRAISING FOR THOSE EFFORTS 

21:55:18 WITH OUR PARTNER AGENCIES AS 

21:55:19 WELL.

21:55:20 I'M HOPING THAT WE CAN DO THAT 

21:55:23 AND BE REALLY STRATEGIC AND 

21:55:25 FOCUSED WITH OUR ABILITY TO 

21:55:26 CREATE A FOUNDATION THAT WILL BE 

21:55:28 VERY SPECIFIC FOR OUR NEEDS 

21:55:30 AROUND FREMONT.

21:55:30 >> Councilmember Keng:   THANK 

21:55:31 YOU VERY MUCH.

21:55:33 TO ARE LIKE THE PARTICULAR 

21:55:35 FUNDRAISING, TO SPECIFIC 

21:55:37 PROJECTS, RIGHT, SO LIKE THERE'S 

21:55:39 FOR EXAMPLE IN THE SHORT TERM, 

21:55:41 PLANS, THERE'S LIKE THE FOUR 

21:55:44 AREAS, SO HOW MUCH, YOU KNOW, DO 

21:55:47 YOU THINK WE CAN -- ARE ABLE TO 

21:55:49 ACCOMPLISH OF THE, YOU KNOW, 

21:55:51 PERCENTAGE WISE OR WHATEVER, YOU 

21:55:53 KNOW LIKE REALISTICALLY?

21:55:55 >> WE HAVE NOT DONE THE FULL 

21:55:56 FINANCIAL ANALYSIS FROM THE 

21:55:57 CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PORTION OF 

21:55:59 IT IN TERMS OF LIKE WHAT 

21:55:59 PERCENTAGE WOULD BE 

21:56:01 ACCOMPLISHMENT IN YEAR ONE, YEAR 

21:56:04 TWO, YEAR THREE, YEAR FOUR SO WE 

21:56:05 WOULD GO BACK THROUGH THAT 

21:56:07 THROUGH OUR CAPITAL PLAN AND LET 

21:56:08 YOU KNOW THROUGH EACH OF THE 

21:56:09 CAPITAL PROGRAMS THROUGH THE 

21:56:11 NEXT TWO YEARS AND THE NEXT 

21:56:13 FOLLOWING TWO YEARS AS WELL.

21:56:13 >> Councilmember Keng:   SOUNDS 

21:56:14 GREAT.

21:56:16 SO I KNOW THAT IN OUR LAST 

21:56:18 MEETING WE HAD ALLOCATED THE 

21:56:20 SURPLUSES THAT WE HAD, ALL OF 

21:56:21 THEM TO PUBLIC WORKS.

21:56:23 SO I DON'T KNOW IF WE ARE ABLE 

21:56:28 TO USE ANY OF UPCOMING YEARS ON 

21:56:29 THAT SURPLUS, PERHAPS WE CAN 

21:56:31 GIVE SOME TO YOU GUYS.

21:56:35 THANK YOU.

21:56:41 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

21:56:43 I WILL MAKE SOME COMMENTS, TOO.

21:56:43 I APOLOGIZE.

21:56:45 I JUST WANTED TO ASK, I KNOW 

21:56:46 THAT WE TALKED ABOUT THE CIP 

21:56:48 PLAN AND I KNOW THAT WHEN WE 

21:56:51 LOOK AT OPPORTUNITIES WE HAVE IN 

21:56:53 THE FUTURE, MAYBE THAT'S 

21:56:55 SOMETHING SEPARATE, DEPENDS, 

21:56:57 WE'VE LOOKED AT PARK FOUNDATION 

21:56:58 OF SOME SORTS.

21:57:00 I KNOW THAT THERE WAS A CALL-OUT 

21:57:01 AND I'D READ SOME OF THE 

21:57:03 COMMENTS FROM HISTORIC PARKS AND 

21:57:04 I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S ANY WAYS 

21:57:06 IN SOME OF THOSE EFFORTS THAT WE 

21:57:08 CAN PARTNER DEPENDING ON 

21:57:10 LOCATION WITH EAST BAY REGION 

21:57:13 AL 

21:57:14 PARKS OR OTHER ENTITIES.

21:57:16 I ALSO WANTED TO SUPPORT, I KNOW 

21:57:18 THAT WE HAD TALKED ABOUT IT MANY 

21:57:20 YEARS AGO, PALM AVENUE AND THAT 

21:57:22 LAND HALF OF IT WAS SOLD AS PART 

21:57:23 OF THE DOWNTOWN EVENT CENTER 

21:57:24 FUNDING.

21:57:25 AND I HOPE THAT WE ARE INCLUDING 

21:57:28 THAT AS OUR NEXT PIECE OF ALSO 

21:57:30 THE CIP JUST BECAUSE OF THE FACT 

21:57:31 THAT WE HAD MADE A COMMITMENT 

21:57:34 WHEN WE SOLD HALF THE PARK TO 

21:57:35 FUND THE DOWNTOWN EVENT CENTER 

21:57:38 THAT WE CONTINUE THAT 

21:57:38 COMMITMENT.

21:57:40 AND THEN I'M CERTAINLY 

21:57:41 INTERESTED IN LEARNING MORE 

21:57:43 ABOUT PICKLE BALL AS I'M ALSO 

21:57:44 VERY EXCITED ABOUT CRICKET 

21:57:46 BECAUSE I JUST WANTED TO MAKE 

21:57:47 THE GENERAL COMMENT THAT WE 

21:57:50 HOPEFULLY SEE WE HAD FROM A TEAM 

21:57:51 OF YOUNG WOMEN IN PARTICULAR AND 

21:57:53 THIS BEING WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH 

21:57:56 I'M VERY EXCITED TO SEE HOW WE 

21:57:57 HAVE MULTIPLE PLAYERS THAT ARE 

21:57:59 PLAYING ON THE NATIONAL TEAM.

21:58:01 AND WE'VE WATCHED THEM AS 

21:58:02 THEY'VE GROWN LITERALLY FROM 

21:58:05 BEING YOUNG WOMEN, YOUNG GIRLS 

21:58:07 TO NOW BEING AT THE WOMEN'S 

21:58:10 LEVEL AND BEING THE OTHER PART 

21:58:11 OF THE WOMEN'S NATIONAL TEAM.

21:58:14 THAT GIVES US GREAT PRIDE AS THE 

21:58:14 CITY OF FREMONT.

21:58:16 WITH THAT SAID I ALSO WANTED TO 

21:58:17 OPEN UP FOR PUBLIC COMMENT SO I 

21:58:21 JUST WANTED TO SEE IF NEELAY OR 

21:58:23 SUZANNE HAD ANY COMMENTS ABOUT 

21:58:29 THE COMMENT ON THE PALM AVENUE 

21:58:32 OR ON THE -- I THINK ALSO A 

21:58:33 CLARIFICATION ON DOG PARKS.

21:58:36 SO SUZANNE DO YOU HAVE ANY 

21:58:38 COMMENTS ON PALM AVENUE OR --

21:58:40 >> I WOULD JUST SAY ON PALM 

21:58:41 AVENUE SPECIFICALLY WE'RE 

21:58:43 LOOKING AT ADDING THAT INTO OUR 

21:58:45 CIP PROJECT MIX FOR NEXT CIP AND 

21:58:48 HOPING TO SEE IF WE HAVE 

21:58:49 SUFFICIENT FUNDING FOR THAT TO 

21:58:51 BEGIN THE PROCESS TO START THE 

21:58:52 COMMUNITY PROCESS THERE.

21:58:54 AND THAT'S WHERE WE WOULD LOOK 

21:58:56 AT A SPECIFIC PLAN TO INCLUDE 

21:58:58 THE COMMUNITY TO GET FEEDBACK, 

21:59:00 TO LOOK AT THE HISTORICAL 

21:59:02 STRUCTURES THERE, TO LOOK AT THE 

21:59:03 ENTIRE PLAN AT THAT SITE TO 

21:59:05 DETERMINE WHERE WE WOULD MOVE 

21:59:07 FORWARD AND COME BACK WITH A 

21:59:08 RECOMMENDATION TO COUNCIL FOR 

21:59:08 THAT SITE.

21:59:11 SO I BELIEVE WE WILL BE STARTING -- I DON'T KNOW IF WE 

21:59:14 WILL BE STARTING IT IN THE FIRST 

21:59:15 CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT IN THIS NEXT 

21:59:17 CYCLE OR IN THE FOLLOWING CYCLE 

21:59:19 BUT IT IS CERTAINLY IN THE NEXT 

21:59:21 FIVE YEARS THAT WE ANTICIPATE 

21:59:23 SEEING PALM AVENUE COME FORWARD.

21:59:23 >> Mayor Mei:   OKAY, I THINK 

21:59:25 IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE 

21:59:27 ORIGINALLY, THAT WAS ONE OF MY 

21:59:28 FIRST COUNCIL VOTES WHEN I GOT 

21:59:30 IN AND IT WAS UNDER THE 

21:59:32 COMMITMENT THAT WE WOULD NOT 

21:59:34 JUST SELL HALF OF IT AND COME 

21:59:35 BACK.

21:59:38 WE WERE HOPING TO ADDRESS IT IN 

21:59:39 THE NEXT TEN YEARS.

21:59:40 I HAVE BEEN HERE A LITTLE WHILE 

21:59:42 ON THE COUNCIL AND TIME FLIES, I 

21:59:44 DON'T WANT IT TO BE SOMETHING 

21:59:45 THAT ONCE I LEAVE WE DON'T 

21:59:47 FORGET AND MOVE ON TO OTHER 

21:59:47 THINGS.

21:59:49 I KNOW THERE ARE COMPETING 

21:59:51 INTERESTS, PEOPLE LOVE PARKS AND 

21:59:55 AS NEELAY HAD COMMENTED ON, WE 

21:59:56 COULD GET THE FOUNDATION TO 

22:00:01 BUILD IN A HAND SET.

22:00:01 >> The Clerk:   COUNCILMEMBER 

22:00:04 COX'S HAND IS RAISED MADAM 

22:00:04 MAYOR.

22:00:07 >> Mayor Mei:   THAT CAME UP 

22:00:09 AFTERWARDS, I'M SCROLLING DOWN.

22:00:09 COUNCILMEMBER COX.

22:00:10 >> Councilmember Cox:   YES, I 

22:00:12 WANTED TO THANK EVERYONE, 

22:00:14 SUZANNE AND YOUR ENTIRE TEAM AND 

22:00:19 THE CONSULTING FIRM WITH NEELAY 

22:00:22 WHERE ALL THE WONDERFUL WORK AND 

22:00:25 ESPECIALLY GETTING A DIVERSE OF 

22:00:27 INPUT FROM EVERYONE FROM THE 

22:00:28 CITY OF FREMONT TO PARTICIPATE.

22:00:33 I'M EXCITED AS A TEEN MOM THAT I 

22:00:34 CAN'T WAIT UNTIL ONE DAY THAT WE 

22:00:38 HAVE A SPORTS PARK THAT WE COULD 

22:00:40 HOST SOME GREAT SPORTS INSTEAD 

22:00:42 OF LEAVING THE CITY OF FREMONT, 

22:00:44 AND GOING TO OTHER PLACES.

22:00:47 I CAN'T WAIT TO BE ABLE TO SEE 

22:00:50 THAT BEING THE COMING INTO FULL 

22:00:52 REALITY.

22:00:55 I'M A MULTITEAM SPORT MOM AND I, 

22:00:56 YOU KNOW, GET EVERYBODY DRUMMED 

22:00:58 UP AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE 

22:01:02 GAMES FOR SPORTSMANSHIP AND 

22:01:04 EXCELLENCE WITH OUR YOUNG 

22:01:05 PEOPLE.

22:01:06 BUT I'M ALSO EXCITED TO SEE HOW 

22:01:08 SOME OF THE THINGS WILL BE 

22:01:10 CARRIED OUT FOR MOST YOU KNOW 

22:01:12 WHAT WE HAVE CURRENTLY ON THE 

22:01:15 LIST TO UPGRADE SOME OF THE 

22:01:17 EXISTING PARKS FIRST THAT ARE IN 

22:01:19 EXISTENCE.

22:01:20 AND THEN BRANCHING OFF TO SOME 

22:01:23 OF THE OTHER AREAS THAT HAVE 

22:01:25 BEEN ADDRESSED IN THE MASTER 

22:01:25 PLAN.

22:01:27 BUT I THINK IT'S THE GREAT WAY 

22:01:30 TO INCLUDE THE WHOLE GENERATIONS 

22:01:34 OF FRIENDS AND FAMILY HAVING A 

22:01:37 FACILITY THAT CAN ACCOMMODATE 

22:01:38 EVERYONE, WHETHER YOU HAVE 

22:01:42 LITTLE TODDLERS TO OUR SENIOR 

22:01:44 CITIZENS BEING IN THE SAME 

22:01:45 FACILITY.

22:01:47 IT WOULD BE ONE HAPPY FAMILY AND 

22:01:50 A LOT OF SUSTAINABILITY THAT 

22:01:52 EVERYBODY COULD GO IN ONE CAR, 

22:01:55 POSSIBLY TO BE ABLE TO EXERCISE 

22:01:57 TOGETHER AND DO IT EVEN AT THE 

22:01:57 PARK.

22:01:59 IF YOU WANT TO DO IT INSIDE OR 

22:01:59 OUTSIDE.

22:02:02 SO THIS IS KIND OF LIKE A, VERY 

22:02:04 MUCH A DREAM OF REALITY TO 

22:02:06 REALLY BENEFIT THE WHOLE ENTIRE 

22:02:06 COMMUNITY.

22:02:11 AND I REALLY THANK EVERYONE 

22:02:13 INVOLVED THAT HAS KEPT US GOING.

22:02:15 AND THIS IS KIND OF LIKE LOOKING 

22:02:16 OUT WITH A VISION OF THE NEW 

22:02:19 THINGS THAT ENHANCES THE 

22:02:21 UNIQUENESS OF LIVING, WORKING 

22:02:22 AND PLAYING HERE IN FREMONT.

22:02:28 SO THANK YOU.

22:02:29 >> HEAR HEAR.

22:02:30 MADAM MAYOR MAY I RESPOND AND 

22:02:32 MAKE A QUICK COMMENT BASED ON 

22:02:34 WHAT YOU SAID EARLIER?

22:02:38 >> Mayor Mei:   SURE, THANK YOU.

22:02:40 >> COUNCILWOMAN COX I APPRECIATE 

22:02:41 YOU SAYING THAT.

22:02:42 AT YOUR FIRST COUNCIL MEETING 

22:02:47 WHEN YOU HAD JUST FIRST BEEN 

22:02:51 ELECTED, YOU BOTH EMPHASIZED 

22:02:54 INCLUSION, AND THEN WITH THE 

22:02:57 SPORTS PARK TOO, MAYOR MEI, KATY 

22:03:00 AND CALVIN ARE PROBABLY OLDER 

22:03:02 NOW BUT AS YOU LOOK AT THE NEXT 

22:03:07 GENERATION OF KATYS AND CALVINS, 

22:03:10 THAT IS WHAT FREMONT IS IN YOUR 

22:03:12 CHURG, THESE FUTURE GENERATIONS 

22:03:13 OF CHILDREN.

22:03:15 THE BEAUTY IS ALWAYS IN THE 

22:03:16 IMPLEMENTATION AND SO ULTIMATELY 

22:03:17 THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO DETERMINE 

22:03:18 THE SUCCESS OF EVERYTHING.

22:03:22 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

22:03:24 YES, I 30 WE ALL AS PARENTS HAVE 

22:03:25 BEEN THROUGH A LOT OF THESE 

22:03:26 EXPERIENCES.

22:03:28 AND CERTAINLY IN THIS PANDEMIC 

22:03:30 TIME THIS IS WHY WE WANT TO HEAR 

22:03:31 FROM OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS HOW 

22:03:35 IMPORTANT IT IS AND I BELIEVE WE 

22:03:36 HAVE QUITE A FEW.

22:03:38 I'M GOING TO BEGIN THROUGH 

22:03:39 PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD.

22:03:41 KATHERINE WE'LL BEGIN WITH YOU.

22:03:42 >> The Clerk:   TWO MINUTES 

22:03:44 MADAM MAYOR IS THAT CORRECT?

22:03:46 >> Mayor Mei:   YES.

22:03:47 KATHERINE WELCOME.

22:03:55 >> HI, THANK YOU FOR THIS TIME.

22:03:58 I WOULD LIKE TO BRING UP THREE 

22:03:59 POINTS CONCERNING THIS.

22:04:01 FIRST I WANT TO SAY, THIS IS NOT 

22:04:03 ONE OF MY POINTS BUT ALL OF THIS 

22:04:05 SOUNDS VERY EXCITING.

22:04:08 BUT I DO HAVE THREE QUESTIONS.

22:04:14 I WANTED TO KNOW FIRST IF 

22:04:16 THERE'S BEEN AN ENVIRONMENTAL 

22:04:19 IMPACT STATEMENT MAZED.

22:04:22 SOMETIME AGO THE GROUND OWLS 

22:04:23 DISAPPEARED, IF THEY EVER CAME 

22:04:27 BACK I WOULD LIKE CONSIDERATION 

22:04:29 GIVEN TO THEM CONSIDERING THEIR 

22:04:31 VERY SMALL HABITAT RANGE AS IT 

22:04:31 IS.

22:04:33 AND IN NOT, WHAT IS THE CHANCE 

22:04:34 OF THEIR RETURN.

22:04:36 AND SECOND, I NOTICE THAT THE 

22:04:38 SIGNAGE AROUND THE LAKE FEEDING 

22:04:40 THE BIRDS WAS INSUFFICIENT AND 

22:04:41 I'D LIKE TO KNOW IF THERE IS A 

22:04:43 BETTER SOLUTION IN MIND OR WOULD 

22:04:45 BE CONSIDERED IN TERMS OF 

22:04:48 FEEDING THE WILDLIFE.

22:04:50 AND FINALLY, I WOULD LIKE TO 

22:04:52 FIND OUT IF THERE WILL BE ANY 

22:04:54 TYPE OF SECURITY PROVIDED AT THE 

22:04:54 PARK.

22:04:56 BECAUSE THERE ARE PREDATORS 

22:05:00 THERE.

22:05:02 I HAVE BEEN ACCOSTED TWICE, ONE 

22:05:04 OF WHICH WAS AT A RESTROOM.

22:05:05 THE ONE THAT WAS ATTACHED TO THE 

22:05:07 RANGER STATION.

22:05:09 AND THAT HAD A HIDDEN VIEW 

22:05:11 BECAUSE OF A WALL BUILT AROUND 

22:05:13 THE ENTRANCE.

22:05:16 AND I WAS ACCOSTED INSIDE OF 

22:05:17 THAT AREA.

22:05:20 SO NO ONE COULD SEE ME.

22:05:21 AND APPARENTLY THAT WAS A BIG 

22:05:22 PROBLEM BECAUSE WHEN I WENT TO 

22:05:24 THE RANGER STATION THEY SAID A 

22:05:27 LOT OF PEOPLE HAD COMPLAINED BUT 

22:05:30 NO ONE WAS WILLING TO REPORT 

22:05:31 THIS TO THE POLICE.

22:05:33 WOULD I BE WILLING TO DO SO, I 

22:05:35 DID SO BUT THE WHOLE EXPERIENCE 

22:05:38 RUINED MY TIME AT THE PARK AND I 

22:05:40 HAVE NOT BEEN BACK SINCE.

22:05:42 SO I JUST WANT TO KNOW IF 

22:05:43 THERE'S GOING TO BE ANY SECURITY 

22:05:46 PROVIDED SO THAT THESE KINDS OF 

22:05:47 THINGS DON'T HAPPEN.

22:05:56 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

22:06:01 THE NEXT SPEAKER IS -- I 

22:06:03 APOLOGIZE I'M LOOKING AT THE 

22:06:03 LIST.

22:06:05 SABA.

22:06:08 >> YES, HI.

22:06:10 THANK YOU.

22:06:14 I'M JUST ALSO EXCITED TO HEAR 

22:06:16 EVERYTHING THAT'S GOING ON AND I 

22:06:18 WANTED TO JUST URGE AND HAPPY TO 

22:06:20 HEAR ABOUT THE COMMITMENT TO 

22:06:22  

22:06:23  

22:06:24 CRICKET.

22:06:26 I THINK IT'S A GROWING SPORT 

22:06:27 ESPECIALLY IN THE CITY OF 

22:06:27 FREMONT.

22:06:29 WITH THE YOUTH AS WELL, I WAS 

22:06:31 BORN AND RAISED IN FREMONT AND 

22:06:36 CRICKET I'VE SEEN IT HOW POPULAR 

22:06:38 IT'S BECOMING AND I'M REALLY 

22:06:39 ENCOURAGED TO PUT ALL EFFORTS 

22:06:40 INTO THAT BECAUSE THERE IS A LOT 

22:06:42 OF SUPPORT IN IT.

22:06:43 ON THE WEEKEND SATURDAY OR 

22:06:45 SUNDAY IF YOU DRIVE ANYWHERE IN 

22:06:46 FREMONT ANY PARK YOU'LL SEE 

22:06:47 PEOPLE PLAYING.

22:06:49 SO THERE IS DEFINITELY NEED FOR 

22:06:51 CRICKET FACILITIES SO I JUST 

22:06:53 WANTED TO GIVE THAT INPUT, THANK 

22:06:53 YOU.

22:06:55 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

22:07:00 NEXT SPEAKER IS ASHWINI KUMAR.

22:07:07 >> HELLO, CAN YOU HEAR ME?

22:07:08 >> Mayor Mei:   YES.

22:07:10 >> HI, GOOD EVENING.

22:07:12 THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME ON THIS, 

22:07:13 GOOD EVENING MAYOR AND 

22:07:17 COUNCILMEMBERS.

22:07:18 EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS THE 

22:07:19 IMPORTANCE OF THE MENTAL HEALTH 

22:07:23 AND HOW BEING OUTDOORS HELPS.

22:07:25 I HAVE BEEN FOR THE PAST 15 

22:07:26 YEARS TRAVELING ALONG WITH MY 

22:07:28 FAMILY TO VARIOUS PLAYGROUNDS 

22:07:29 ACROSS BAY AREA AND VARIOUS 

22:07:32 PARTS OF U.S. TO SPEND TIME 

22:07:33 OUTDOORS WATCHING AND PLAYING 

22:07:34 CRICKET.

22:07:36 KEEPING IN LINE WITH THE FOCUS 

22:07:40 ON DIVERSITY AND INCLUSIVITY, I 

22:07:41 SUPPORT AND REQUEST THE CITY 

22:07:44 COUNCIL MEMBERS TO PRIORITIZE AN 

22:07:45 APPROPRIATE FACILITY WAS A 

22:07:47 SPORTS THAT IS PLAYED ACROSS 106 

22:07:49 COUNTRY, WORLDWIDE, INCLUDING 

22:07:52 U.S.

22:07:55 SO THERE ARE VARIOUS COMMUNITIES 

22:07:57 WHICH WE WOULD BE SUPPORTING BY 

22:07:59 DOING THIS.

22:08:02 WE SPEND, IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT 

22:08:06 THERE'S A LOT OF SENSE IN DOING 

22:08:08 THAT, WE SPEND A LOT OF MONEY 

22:08:10 WHEN WE DO THESE THINGS AND 

22:08:11 WHICH WOULD HELP THE LOCAL 

22:08:14 COMMUNITIES BY PROVIDING A 

22:08:16 CRICKET FACILITY HERE IN OUR 

22:08:18 BACKYARD IN FREMONT.

22:08:20 I WOULD STRONGLY REQUEST AND 

22:08:21 SUGGEST THAT WE HAVE THIS 

22:08:26 CRICKET GROUND APPROVED 

22:08:27 UNANIMOUSLY BY THE 

22:08:27 COUNCILMEMBERS.

22:08:27 THANK YOU.

22:08:32 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU, NEXT 

22:08:34 SPEAKER IS KRISHNA.

22:08:44 >> GOOD EVENING, EVERYONE.

22:08:48 I'M KRISHNA AGERWALD.

22:08:50 A HIGH SCHOOLER IN THE AREA AND 

22:08:51 A RESIDENT OF FREMONT.

22:08:53 I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE CITY 

22:08:56 OF FREMONT TO TAKE THIS 

22:08:58 INITIATIVE TO CREATE MORE PARKS.

22:09:01 I HAVE LIVED HERE SINCE I WAS A 

22:09:03 ONE YEAR OLD, SO I CAN SAY I'VE 

22:09:06 LIVED HERE MOST OF MY LIFE.

22:09:10 I MOSTLY HAVE LIVED IN ARDENWOOD 

22:09:13 AND NEAR OHLONE, I'VE SEEN THE 

22:09:16 CITY GROW FROM A QUIET SLEEPER 

22:09:17 COMMUNITY TO A HIGH TRAFFIC 

22:09:18 COMMUNITY.

22:09:21 I'VE SEEN A LOT OF CONSTRUCTION 

22:09:23 IN THE AREA, WITH CONSTRUCTION 

22:09:26 OF MULTIUNIT DEVELOPMENTS.

22:09:32 THE CITY'S COMMITMENT TO MORE 

22:09:34 OPEN SPACES, THIS WILL HELP US 

22:09:36 TO HAVE OPEN SPACES TO PLAY.

22:09:39 FOR ME PERSONALLY AS I LAY 

22:09:41 CRICKET, I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE 

22:09:42 MORE OPEN SPACES, AS THERE ARE 

22:09:45 LIMITED SPACES AS OF NOW.

22:09:46 THIS WILL ALSO HELP IN OUR 

22:09:48 OVERALL MENTAL HEALTH WHICH IS 

22:09:50 QUITE IMPACTED BY THE HIGH 

22:09:54 PRESSURE EVER BUSINESSES AND 

22:09:55 SCHOOLS.

22:09:56 I'M IN SUPPORT OF THE OPEN 

22:09:58 SPACES AND NEW PARKS.

22:09:59 THANK YOU.

22:10:01 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

22:10:02 NEXT SPEAKER IS RUHAN.

22:10:08 >> HI, I'M RUHAN SWAR, I'M 16

22:10:14 PLAYING CRICKET MY OVERWHELM 

22:10:17 LIFE AND IT'S A BIG DEAL TO ME.

22:10:21  WHOLE LIFE 

22:10:25 AND IT'S A BIG DEAL TO ME.

22:10:29 IT'S MY GOAL TO MAKE THE U.S.A. 

22:10:30 CRICKET TEAM.

22:10:32 I'VE BEEN TO A LOT PLACES IN 

22:10:34 THIS COUNTRY AND THERE ARE A LOT 

22:10:36 OF PLACES THAT HAVE A LOT OF 

22:10:38 CRICKET FACILITIES AND TURF 

22:10:39 GROUNDS AND FREMONT COST NOT 

22:10:41 HAVE A LOT OF TURF GROUNDS THAT 

22:10:42 YOU CAN PLAY ON THAT YOU CAN 

22:10:44 PLAY ON SO THAT IS SOMETHING I 

22:10:46 WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE OF.

22:10:49 THANK YOU.

22:10:51 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

22:10:51 WELCOME.

22:10:52 GOOD EVENING.

22:10:59 WILLIAM ARUTY.

22:11:04 >> YES.

22:11:06 >> Mayor Mei:   SORRY, COULD YOU 

22:11:08 UNMUTE FOR ME PLEASE?

22:11:11 >> YES I CAN, YES, THIS IS 

22:11:18 WILLIAM UREGY, MISSION PEAK 

22:11:21  

22:11:23 CONSERVANCY.

22:11:24 STATED IMPROVEMENT TO PARK 

22:11:26 ACCESS.

22:11:28 PRIMARY REASON GIVEN IN THE 

22:11:30 COMMUNITY SERVICES SCIENTIFIC 

22:11:31 SURVEY WHICH WAS HANDED OUT TO 

22:11:34 ALL OF -- TO MANY, MANY PEOPLE 

22:11:35 WAS THAT PEOPLE ARE NOT USING 

22:11:37 PARKS BECAUSE OF A LACK OF 

22:11:38 AVAILABLE PARKING.

22:11:40 REGIONAL PARKS SURROUND FREMONT 

22:11:43 HAVE THIS ISSUE INCLUDING COYOTE 

22:11:44 HILLS, MISSION PEAK, THEY ALL 

22:11:46 SUFFER FROM LIMITED PARKING.

22:11:48 WE ENCOURAGE THE CITY COUNCIL TO 

22:11:49 CONSIDER CONVERTING LIMITED OPEN 

22:11:52 SPACE INTO PARKING AREAS EITHER 

22:11:54 INSIDE OR NEAR OUR PUBLIC PARKS.

22:11:58 THIS WOULD INCLUDE A FEW OF THE 

22:12:01 THOUSAND ACRES AVAILABLE IN 

22:12:02 MISSION HILLS.

22:12:04 THE IMPORTANT CANNOT BE 

22:12:04 UNDERSCORED.

22:12:07 WE NEED SAFE ACCESSIBLE TRAILS 

22:12:08 THAT LIMIT THE POSSIBILITY OF 

22:12:13 VEHICULAR CRASHES THAT MAIM OR 

22:12:16 INJURE PERSONS, COMMUNITIES 

22:12:18 HABITAT FOR WILDLIFE AND THE 

22:12:19 TRANSIT CORRIDOR.

22:12:20 WE HAVE VERY FEW CONNECTED 

22:12:22 TRAILS AND THE OPPORTUNITY FOR 

22:12:23 BUILDING NEW TRAILS IS VERY 

22:12:23 HIGH.

22:12:25 THE STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENT 

22:12:27 ARE ALLOCATING FUNDS FROM THE 

22:12:28 DEVELOPMENT OF TRAILS BUT THE 

22:12:30 CITY HAS TO WRITE THE GRANTS AND 

22:12:31 BE A MEMBER OF THE REGIONAL 

22:12:33 ORGANIZATIONS THAT DIRECT 

22:12:34 FUNDING.

22:12:36 THE MASTER PLAN SUMMARIZES THE 

22:12:37 VISION OF WHAT OUR CITY CAN 

22:12:38 BECOME.

22:12:39 WE LOOK FORWARD TO SUPPORTING 

22:12:41 THE CITY IN ACCOMPLISHING 

22:12:43 COMMUNITY SERVICE DEPARTMENT 

22:12:43 BILLS.

22:12:43 THANK YOU.

22:12:47 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

22:12:50 NEXT SPEAKER IS SHREDA RAU.

22:12:54 >> HI, THANK YOU FOR THE 

22:12:55 OPPORTUNITY.

22:13:01 I'M SHREDA RAU, I'VE BEEN IN 

22:13:03 FREMONT FOR THE PAST 23 YEARS.

22:13:06 I'M A U.S.A. WOMEN'S CRICKET 

22:13:08 COORDINATOR FOR BAY AREA.

22:13:10 WE HAVE A SITUATION HERE WHERE 

22:13:15 WE HAVE ENOUGH WOMEN AND GIRL 

22:13:16 PLAYERS TO PLAY IN FREMONT BUT 

22:13:18 WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH GROUND 

22:13:19 FACILITIES SO SOMETIMES THEY 

22:13:21 DON'T GET TO PLAY EVERY WEEK, 

22:13:23 SOMETIMES WE GET TO FLAY ONCE OR 

22:13:24 TWICE A MONTH.

22:13:25 IT WOULD BE GREAT TO HAVE OPEN 

22:13:27 SPACES FOR CRICKET AND I DO 

22:13:28 SUPPORT THE MASTER PLAN FOR 

22:13:30 BRINGING UP MORE PARKS AND OPEN 

22:13:31 SPACES FOR THAT.

22:13:31 THANK YOU.

22:13:36 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

22:13:40 NEXT SPEAKER IS GRETCHEN 

22:13:41 MENDENHALL.

22:13:44 >> GOOD EVENING, CAN YOU HEAR 

22:13:44 ME?

22:13:45 >> Mayor Mei:   YES.

22:13:46 >> THANK YOU.

22:13:48 GOOD EVENING TO EVERYONE, I WANT 

22:13:50 TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE MANY MONTHS 

22:13:52 SPENT ON THE PARK MASTER PLAN.

22:13:55 I'M VERY GLAD TO SEE THE UPDATE 

22:13:55 HAPPENING.

22:13:57 I KNOW THERE HAVE BEEN MANY 

22:13:59 MEETINGS AND STAFF HOURS, 

22:14:00 CONSULTANT HOURS, PUBLIC 

22:14:02 MEETINGS AND THE SURVEY AND ALL 

22:14:04 ITS RESULTS.

22:14:06 THAT BEING SAID, MY CONCERN IS 

22:14:08 THAT WE NEED MORE TIME TO CREATE 

22:14:11 A VISION FOR OUR HISTORICAL 

22:14:11 PARKS.

22:14:13 THE FREMONT COMMUNITY HAS 

22:14:16 PRIORITIZED HISTORICAL PARK 

22:14:20 PROGRAMS AS A HIGH PRIORITY, AND 

22:14:24 YET A VISION FOR HOW TO 

22:14:34 ACCOMPLISH -- HOW TO ACCOMPLISH 

22:14:36 THIS IS REALLY NOT PLANNED OUT 

22:14:38 OR SPELLED OUT IN THE MASTER 

22:14:38 PLAN.

22:14:40 AND I THINK THAT COULD BE ADDED 

22:14:42 QUITE EASILY INTO THE SHORT TERM 

22:14:44 GOALS THAT WERE DISCUSSED A 

22:14:45 LITTLE BIT EARLIER.

22:14:47 I THINK THAT OUR HISTORICAL 

22:14:49 PARKS SHOULD BE TREATED AS GEMS 

22:14:50 IN OUR CITY.

22:14:51 THEY ARE UNIQUE AND THEY NEED A 

22:14:53 VISION OF THEIR OWN.

22:14:54 AND THAT COULD BE ADDED SO 

22:14:57 EASILY TO THIS PLAN.

22:14:59 AGAIN, IN THE SHORT TERM GOALS.

22:15:00 OUR HISTORICAL PARKS ARE NOT 

22:15:02 JUST CITY PARKS WITH HISTORY.

22:15:04 THEY CAN BE SO MUCH MORE AS WE 

22:15:06 LOOK AROUND THE COUNTRY AND 

22:15:07 INTERNATIONALLY, THERE ARE SO 

22:15:10 MANY OPTIONS THAT COULD REALLY 

22:15:13 HIGHLIGHT OUR PARK -- OUR 

22:15:14 HISTORICAL PARKS AND DRAW PEOPLE 

22:15:15 TO OUR CITY.

22:15:17 I THINK FREMONT NEEDS A VISION 

22:15:19 FOR THE HISTORICAL PARKS, I'D 

22:15:21 LIKE TO SEE THATADDED TO THE 

22:15:23 SHORT TERM PLANS AND ALSO FOR 

22:15:25 NEXT TIME AROUND, ADD A 30 DAY 

22:15:28 REVIEW PERIOD BEFORE IT GOES TO 

22:15:29 THE REC COMMISSION.

22:15:32 THAT WOULD GIVE EVERYONE TIME 

22:15:34 FOR A LITTLE MORE INPUT ON THIS 

22:15:36 DOCUMENT.

22:15:37 THANK YOU SO MUCH.

22:15:39 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

22:15:42 NEXT SPIEKER IS ALYSSA WINTERS.

22:15:53 >> CAN YOU HEAR ME?

22:15:54 >> Mayor Mei:   YES.

22:16:00 >> I'M ALYSSA WINTERS.

22:16:03 I THOROUGHLY SUPPORT THE PLAN.

22:16:05 HIGHEST NATIONAL STANDARD.

22:16:07 AS EVERY STEP, STAFF LISTENED TO 

22:16:08 COMMUNITY AND COMMISSION 

22:16:09 FEEDBACK FROM OUR REGULAR 

22:16:12 MEETINGS TO SURVEYS AND MORE.

22:16:13 AND ADDRESSED ALL OF OUR 

22:16:14 CONCERNS.

22:16:16 THE RESULT IS A PLAN THAT TRULY 

22:16:19 REFLECTS FREMONT'S VALUES OF 

22:16:22 INCLUSION AND ACCESS TO OUR 

22:16:24 WONDERFUL PARKS FOR EVERYONE.

22:16:25 FURTHERMORE THE PLAN INCLUDES A 

22:16:27 FUTURE OF FREMONT INCLUDING 

22:16:34  

22:16:36 VINYL SUSTAINABILITY.

22:16:40 THIS MAKES THE PLAN POSSIBLE FOR 

22:16:42 FREMONT'S IMMEDIATE NEEDS.

22:16:44 I HOPE YOU CAN APPROVE THE PLAN 

22:16:45 FULLY TONIGHT AND I APPRECIATE 

22:16:46 IT.

22:16:58 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

22:17:00 >> CAN YOU HEAR ME?

22:17:01 >> Mayor Mei:   YES.

22:17:04 >> MY NAME IS PATRICIA, I WAS 

22:17:06 BORN AND RAISED IN FREMONT AND 

22:17:08 SO NOT ONLY DO I HAVE A LOT OF 

22:17:09 HISTORY BUT I APPRECIATE THE 

22:17:11 HISTORY, THE UNIQUE HISTORY 

22:17:15 THAT'S HERE IN FREMONT.

22:17:19 AND I ALSO WANT TO RECOGNIZE 

22:17:20 THAT THERE ARE MANY ELEMENTS 

22:17:22 THAT I'M VERY PLEASED WITH IN 

22:17:24 THE MASTER PLAN.

22:17:30 I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THOUGH THAT 

22:17:32 SOME OF THE HISTORIC PROPERTIES 

22:17:34 THAT ARE NOT MENTIONED AS 

22:17:35 HISTORIC COULD BE ADDED AS 

22:17:36 HISTORIC.

22:17:39 FOR INSTANCE THE SIL VEST AT THE 

22:17:42 HARVEY PARK, THE PALM AFTERNOON 

22:17:44 PARK, BOTH OF THOSE HAVE A RICH 

22:17:46 STREET AND ARE NOT EVEN 

22:17:49 MENTIONED AS HISTORIC.

22:17:52 WE HAVE SOME DURHAM HOUSE AND 

22:17:55 OUR LOCAL CITY MUSEUM THAT ARE 

22:17:56 NOT EVEN RECOGNIZED AS HISTORIC.

22:17:58 SO I'D LIKE TO SEE THAT 

22:18:00 RECOGNITION AND ALSO, IN THE 

22:18:02 PLAN, IT SAID THAT 

22:18:05 MULTIGENERATIONAL AND MULTIUSE 

22:18:06 RECREATION CENTERS WILL BE A 

22:18:08 PRIORITY IN CENTRAL PARK.

22:18:10 I THINK THAT THOSE BUILDINGS, 

22:18:13 BECAUSE HISTORY IS SO IMPORTANT, 

22:18:16 THAT THERE SHOULD BE, WHEN YOU 

22:18:19 MAKE A RECREATIONAL FACILITY, 

22:18:23 BECAUSE PARKS AND RECREATIONS 

22:18:25 ALSO INCLUDES HISTORY AND ART, 

22:18:27 THAT THERE SHOULD BE GALLERIES 

22:18:30 AND MEETING PLACES IN THOSE 

22:18:33 FACILITIES DESIGNATED AS 

22:18:37 HISTORIC, YOU KNOW HISTORY 

22:18:39 DISPLAYS, ET CETERA.

22:18:40 AND THE NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS 

22:18:41 THAT HELP TO RUN THOSE 

22:18:44 ORGANIZATIONS, HAVE SOME MEETING 

22:18:48 SPACE WITHOUT THE COST THAT 

22:18:52 WOULD BE SOMETIMES PROHIBITIVE 

22:18:53 FOR SMALL NONPROFITS.

22:18:55 SO I APPROVE THE TRAILS THAT ARE 

22:18:57 COMING IN AND THE NETWORKS, AND 

22:18:59 I HOPE THAT WE CAN ALL 

22:19:00 COLLABORATE TOGETHER.

22:19:03 THANK YOU.

22:19:06 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU NEXT 

22:19:16 SPEAKER IS ISHANI.

22:19:19 >> HI, I SUPPORT THIS PLAN FOR 

22:19:22 MORE OPEN SPACES AND PARKS.

22:19:26 THAT MANY GREAT CRICKET FIELDS

22:19:32 WOMEN'S TEAM AND RECENTLY WENT 

22:19:37 TO MEXICO AND ZIMBABWE TO PLAY

22:19:42 HELPS MAKE GOOD CRICKET 

22:19:43 FACILITIES HERE IN FREMONT.

22:20:02 AND RECS.

22:20:03 FREMONT FROM THE TIME I WAS HERE 

22:20:07 TO TODAY HAS MOVED ON 

22:20:13 TECHNICALLY, TECHNOLOGICALLY, 

22:20:15 22nd CENTURY MODE.

22:20:17 OR PARKS AND RECS ARE PROBABLY 

22:20:19 IN THE 19th, 20th CENTURY 

22:20:21 AND IT'S THE RIGHT TIMING.

22:20:23 WE HAVE ALL SEEN THE EFFECTS OF 

22:20:25 COVID COMING AND AFFECTING AN 

22:20:28 CONFINING US TO OUR HOMES AND WE 

22:20:31 EARNED EAGERLY TO GET OUT AND BE 

22:20:33 OUT IN THE OPEN SPACES AND SAW 

22:20:35 THE DIFFICULTIES OURSELVES.

22:20:39 AND SO WE SAW THE DESPERATE NEED 

22:20:40 FOR CONNECTED TRAILS, YOU KNOW 

22:20:43 OPEN SPACES, EXPLORE THE CITY.

22:20:45 YOU KNOW, AND ALSO BE OUT THERE 

22:20:47 IN A MULTIGENERATIONAL FACILITY 

22:20:49 WHERE I COULD GO AND DROP MY 

22:20:51 KID, PLAY A SPORT THAT HE 

22:20:53 PREFERS TO PLAY AND WHILE I AM 

22:20:54 OUT WALKING THE TRAILS OR 

22:20:56 WHATEVER I'M DOING.

22:20:58 THOSE KIND OF FACILITIES ARE 

22:20:59 ALREADY THERE IN SEVERAL CITIES 

22:21:01 THAT WE HAVE TRAVELED TO PLAY 

22:21:02 OUR SPORT.

22:21:03 BUT, YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT THERE 

22:21:06 AND WE ARE, YOU KNOW, REALLY,

22:21:50 KIDS LIKE TO ALWAYS SPEND LOT OF 

22:21:54 TIME IN THEIR iPADS SO IT'S 

22:22:04 REALLY A ACCOMPLISHMENT FOR 

22:22:06 PARENTS TO TAKE THEIR KIDS OUT.

22:22:08 I WOULD TAKE MY PERSONAL 

22:22:10 EXPERIENCE THAT WE ARE TRAVELING 

22:22:14 EVERY WEEKEND TO MORGAN HILL FOR 

22:22:16 MATCHES BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE 

22:22:19 ANY TURF GROUNDS.

22:22:21 IF WE GET THAT KIND OF FACILITY 

22:22:22 IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD IT WOULD 

22:22:23 REALLY HELP US AND THE TRAVELING

22:22:56 AND HE IS REPRESENTED U.S.A. IN 

22:22:58 THE UNDER 19 AS WELL AS THE 

22:22:59 MEN'S LEVEL.

22:23:00 WHAT I'VE SEEN AS A PARENT IS 

22:23:03 THE NEED FOR GOOD INFRASTRUCTURE 

22:23:06 AND FACILITIES FOR SOMEBODY TO 

22:23:07 THRIVE AND I'VE SEEN FREMONT 

22:23:09 THAT WE HAVE A WHOLE BUNCH OF 

22:23:10 KIDS WHO HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO 

22:23:12 MAKE IT BIG.

22:23:15 AND I WOULD REALLY RECOMMEND YOU 

22:23:18 TO THINK ABOUT HAVING A GREAT 

22:23:19 INTERNATIONAL LEVEL FACILITY 

22:23:20 AVAILABLE FOR THE YOUTH AS WELL 

22:23:22 AS ADULTS TO PRACTICE AND PLAY 

22:23:23 ON.

22:24:18 THE CALL EARLIER, ONE OF YOUR 

22:24:22 COLLEAGUES MENTIONED TAKING HER 

22:24:24 DOGS OFF LEASH WHICH I KNOW IS 

22:24:25 AN ISSUE.

22:24:27 AND I'VE BEEN GUILTY OF THAT 

22:24:28 PRIMARILY BECAUSE THERE ISN'T A 

22:24:30 DOG PARK AROUND WHERE I LIVE AND 

22:24:32 WE END UP GOING TO ONE OF THE 

22:24:35 ENCLOSED BASEBALL FIELDS AT THE 

22:24:37 WARM SPRINGS ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 

22:24:39 AND UNLEASH OUR DOGS.

22:24:40 WHICH IS NOT IDEAL BECAUSE I 

22:24:43 KNOW THE BASEBALL CREW GETS VERY 

22:24:45  GETS VERY 

22:24:47 UPSET ABOUT IT.

22:24:49 MY URGE TO YOU IS TO PLEASE 

22:24:50 ADOPT THIS PLAN.

22:24:53 I'M THOROUGHLY IMPRESSBY WHAT 

22:24:57 NEELAY AND HIS CREW HAVE DONE.

22:24:58 THE PLAN IS VERY WELL THOUGHT 

22:25:01 OUT, REPRESENTS EVERYTHING WE 

22:25:05 NEED, DOG PARKS, CRICKET FIELDS, 

22:25:07 PICKLE BALL, EVERYTHING THAT IS 

22:25:08 RELEVANT FOR THE CITY.

22:25:09 SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.

22:25:10 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

22:25:19 NEXT SPEAKER IS RAHOL.

22:25:22 >> YES, THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME 

22:25:23 THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK, MY 

22:25:29 NAME IS RAHOL GERIWALA, I'M A 

22:25:31 SENIOR IN HIGH SCHOOL.

22:25:32 I'VE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO 

22:25:35 REPRESENT THE MEN'S LEVEL, AT 

22:25:37 THE INTERNATIONAL LEVEL YOU PUT 

22:25:40 TOP CLASS FACILITIES BUT LIVING 

22:25:42 IN FREMONT I HAVEN'T HAD THE 

22:25:44 OPPORTUNITY TO TRAIN AT THOSE 

22:25:46 FACILITIES WITHOUT AGAIN 

22:25:48 TRAVELING OMORGAN HILL AND OTHER 

22:25:49 VARIOUS PLACES WHICH TAKES INTO 

22:25:50 THE TRAINING TIME ITSELF.

22:25:52 AND I FEEL LIKE IF FREMONT AS A 

22:25:55 CITY CAN ADOPT TOP-NOTCH CRICKET 

22:25:57 STADIUM IN THIS CITY ITSELF YOU 

22:25:59 WILL SEE THE GROWTH OF BOTH 

22:26:00 CRICKET PLAYED IN GENERAL AND 

22:26:02 THE AMOUNT OF INTERNATIONAL 

22:26:03 PLAYERS FROM THE CITY OF FREMONT 

22:26:04 WHICH WE ALREADY HAVE A LOT OF.

22:26:06 SO I THINK HAVING A TOP-NOTCH 

22:26:07 FACILITY IN FREMONT WOULD DO 

22:26:09 GREAT THINGS TO BOTH THE CITY 

22:26:11 ITSELF AND THE CRICKETERS OF THE 

22:26:12 CITY.

22:26:12 THANK YOU.

22:26:17 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

22:26:20 NEXT SPEAKER IS TRISHA.

22:26:22 >> CAN EVERYONE HEAR ME?

22:26:23 >> Mayor Mei:   YES.

22:26:25 >> OKAY, HI I'M TRISHA I'M A 

22:26:26 JUNIOR AT MISSION SAN JOSE HIGH 

22:26:28 SCHOOL AND AS PART OF THE 

22:26:30 NATIONAL UNDER 19LESS WOMEN'S 

22:26:32 CRICKET TEAM AND THE CAPTAIN OF 

22:26:35 OUR SOFTBALL TEAM, I WOULD LIKE 

22:26:38 TO POINT OUT THAT WE ARE ALWAYS 

22:26:41 COMPETING FOR FUNDS, A LOT OF 

22:26:45 TIME MY TEAM IS NOT ABLE TO PLAY 

22:26:47 PRACTICE GAMES, TOTAL OF ABOUT 

22:26:49 30 PLAYERS HAVE TO SHARE ONE 

22:26:50 FIELD OF PRACTICE AND WE OFTEN 

22:26:53 HAVE TO TRAVEL AS FAR AS 

22:26:55 LIVERMORE OR HAYWARD BECAUSE WE 

22:27:01 DON'T HAVE THE PRACTICE.

22:27:05 THIS CHAOS OFTEN CARES OVER TO 

22:27:06 OUR PLAY AS WELL.

22:27:09 THE PLACES WE ARE ABLE TO PLAY 

22:27:12 AT ARE OFTEN NOT SAFE TO USE.

22:27:15 DIRECTLY INVESTING IN ATHLETIC 

22:27:19 SUCCESS, NOT JUST FOR ME BUT ALL 

22:27:21 FEMALE $ACROSS THE CITY.

22:27:23 THEY FEEL JUST AS ENCOURAGED AND 

22:27:25 INSPIRED TO COME UP AND PICK UP 

22:27:26 A SPORT.

22:27:28 MY COACHES ARE'S SAYING, THE 

22:27:31 WORK YOU PUT IN IS SHOWING ON 

22:27:32 THE FIELD.

22:27:34 THIS SHOWS UP AS WELL, YOU ARE 

22:27:36 HELPING SUPPORT OUR SUCCESS ON 

22:27:37 THE FIELD.

22:27:38 THANK YOU.

22:27:40 >> Mayor Mei:   NEXT SPEAKER 

22:27:40 ISVJ.

22:27:50  IS 

22:27:50 VJ.

22:27:57 >> MY NAME IS VJ KUMAR, BEEN AN 

22:28:00 ACTIVE TRENT IN THE AREA FOR 20 

22:28:01 YEARS.

22:28:04 MY SON 14 AND MY DAUGHTER NINE, 

22:28:08 I HAD THE PLEASURE OF MEETING 

22:28:11 MAYOR LILY MEI AND GOT A 

22:28:13 CERTIFICATE FROM HER.

22:28:15 CRICKET IS COMING TO THE U.S. IN 

22:28:16 A COUPLE OF YEARS AND THERE ARE 

22:28:18 TALKS OF GAMES HAPPENING IN THE 

22:28:19 BAY AREA AS WELL CRICKET BEING 

22:28:22 THE SECOND MOST POPULAR SPORT IN 

22:28:26 THE WORLD, THERE WOULD BE A LOT 

22:28:28 OF, YOU KNOW, IT WOULD BE GREAT 

22:28:30 TO HAVE FREMONT AS PART OF THE 

22:28:31 LAND SCAPE.

22:28:32 JUST WANT TO SHARE THAT AND 

22:28:34 LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING THE 

22:28:35 PARK AND RECREATION MASTER PLAN 

22:28:36 COME TO FRUITION AND THANK YOU 

22:28:38 FOR THE OPPORTUNITY.

22:28:39 >> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

22:28:44 NEXT SPEAKER IS PARU SHATAN.

22:28:51 >> HI, CAN YOU HEAR ME?

22:28:52 >> Mayor Mei:   YES.

22:28:54 >> THIS IS PARU, I'M IN SUPPORT 

22:28:57 OF MORE OPEN SPACE, CITY OF 

22:28:59 FREMONT DEFINITELY NEEDS MORE 

22:29:01 PARKS AND OPEN SPACES WHICH WE 

22:29:03 LACK TODAY AND EVEN WHEN I GO 

22:29:04 AROUND IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

22:29:07 SO MOST OF THE PARKS ARE 

22:29:09 OVERCROWDED AND THEN WE DON'T 

22:29:11 GET TO PLAY OR SPEND TIME 

22:29:14 BECAUSE OF OVERCROWDEDNESS AND 

22:29:16 THE OTHER THING IS MY KIDS ALSO 

22:29:20 PLAY CRICKET AND I THINK THAT 

22:29:21 DEFINITELY BAY AREA AS A WHOLE 

22:29:28 ALSO LACKS CRICKET FACILITIES, 

22:29:30 THESE MANY CRICKET PLAYING YOUTH 

22:29:32 LESION AND WE HAVE A LOT OF LACK 

22:29:34 OF INFRASTRUCTURE AND THEN 

22:29:37 FREMONT BEING THE LARGEST 

22:29:39 POPULATION PLAYING CRICKET WE 

22:29:41 DEFINITELY NEED MORE CRICKET 

22:29:41 FIELDS.

22:29:44 AND I ALSO HEARD OF A 

22:29:44 PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP.

22:29:49 I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE EVEN 

22:29:50 WHEN WE ARE MAKING THE CRICKET 

22:29:52 FIELDS AND EVERYTHING ELSE CITY 

22:29:55 SHOULD MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T 

22:29:57 MONOPOLIZE ANY FIELD THAT WE 

22:29:59 CREATE, BASICALLY THAT IT SHOULD 

22:30:02 BE FOR PLISK USE AND IT SHOULD 

22:30:05 BE FIRST COME FIRST SERVED, AND 

22:30:09 IT'S SHARED USE BASIS FOR 

22:30:10 DIFFERENT YOUTH LEAGUES.

22:30:12 SO I WANT DEFINITELY THE CITY 

22:30:15 COUNCIL TO CONSIDER MAKE SURE 

22:30:17 THAT IS BALANCED USE NOT 

22:30:18 MONOPOLIZED.

22:30:48 >> Mayor Mei:   NEXT SPEAKER IS 

22:30:49 JOHN HINES.

22:30:51 >> CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW?

22:30:52 >> Mayor Mei:   YES WE CAN.

22:30:53 >> THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN 

22:30:56 THINGS THAT CAN BE REALLY COOL 

22:30:57 ANTIQUES AND THINGS THAT ARE 

22:31:03 JUST OLD LIKE ME.

22:31:05 THE PRESIDENT'S HOUSE IS JUST 

22:31:05 OLD.

22:31:08 IT DOESN'T HAVE COOL ANTIQUE, 

22:31:12 BUT THE PLAN CALLS FOR TURNING 

22:31:14 IT INTO WEDDINGS AND OTHER 

22:31:20 EVENTS AS A REVENUE MAKER PEOPLE WILL USE IT ONLY DURING THE DAY SO THEY CAN 
22:31:24 TAKE THEIR PICTURES ELSEWHERE AND DAY TIME ONLY MEANS WEEKEND ONLY, SPRING 
22:31:26 AND SUMMER NOT MUCH REVENUE POTENTIAL.

22:31:32 IF WE JUSTIFICATION IT UP NICELY ENOUGH TO BE PRESENTABLE, THERE IS A HIGHER 
22:31:33 VALUE USE AS A MUSEUM.

22:31:40  THEY COULD FILL THE PLACE PRETTY QUICKLY, THEY ALREADY HAVE EXPERIENCE 
22:31:44 LEADING TOURS OF SCHOOL CHILDREN THROUGH A FACILITY LIKE THIS AND CAN 
22:31:48 TELL THEM HOW LIFE AND WORK WERE LIKE ON A WORKING NURSERY.

22:31:54 BECAUSE IT COULD BE USED MORE DAYS PER WEEK THAT WAY, IT WOULD ALMOST 
22:31:57 CERTAINLY BRING IN MORE REVENUE THAN AS A WEDDING VENUE.

22:32:03 FINALLY, IT THE CALIFORNIA NURSERY HISTORIC PARK, ITS DEFINING FEATURES 
22:32:07 ARE THAT IT IS A NURSERY AND IT IS HISTORIC, A VERY FITTING USE OF THE 
22:32:10 BUILDING WOULD BE AS A MUSEUM OF WORKING NURSERIES.

22:32:10 THANK YOU.

22:32:15 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

22:32:19 NEXT SPEAKER IS REZA KHAN.

22:32:26 >> HELLO, GOOD EVENING, THANK YOU GUYS FOR YOUR TIME.

22:32:28 I JUST WANTED TO SHARE A QUICK STORY WITH YOU.

22:32:37 I CAME INTO THIS COUNTRY IN 1986 AS A PASSIONATE CRICKET-LOVING KID.

22:32:42 THERE WERE NO CRICKET FACILITIES DEURNTION THAT TIME.

22:32:44 I LEARNED THE GAME OF BASEBALL BECAUSE OF CRICKET.

22:32:56 FAST FORWARD NOW, MY KIDS ARE 9 AND 10 YEARS OLD, AND I SEE THE FACILITIES IN 
22:32:57 FREMONT, VERY, VERY LIMITED.

22:33:02 I WOULD LIKE TO URGE THE CITY COUNCIL AND THE MAYOR TO PLEASE IMPLEMENT THIS 
22:33:11 PLAN ASAP, OR AT LEAST -- AND MOVE CRICKET FORWARD.

22:33:15 WE HAVE A LOT OF PASSIONATE MEMBERS THAT PLAY CRICKET, AND WE WOULD LIKE 
22:33:17 YOU TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS PLAN ASAP.

22:33:20 THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME, AND YOU GUYS HAVE A GREAT EVENING.

22:33:22 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

22:33:23 KELLY.

22:33:25 YOU'RE NEXT.

22:33:26 THANK YOU.

22:33:28 >> THANK YOU.

22:33:30 >> Mayor Mei: PLEASE DON'T -- GO AHEAD.

22:33:34 I'M JUST LOOKING AT PEOPLE ADDING MORE SPEAKERS BUT I THINK WE HAVE TO CLOSE 
22:33:38 PUBLIC COMMENT AFTER -- KELLY, GO AHEAD.

22:33:45 >> I THINK THIS IS A GOOD PLAN THAT IS PRETTY WELL THOUGHT OUT.

22:33:51 THE ONLY OTHER PLAN I'VE SEEN THAT HAS HAD THIS LEVEL OF THOUGHT AND WORK PUT 
22:33:55 INTO IT IS THE HAYWARD SHORELINE PLAN.

22:34:08 SO THIS -- I THINK WHEN IT COMES TO THESE ACTIVE RECREATIONAL THINGS, THAT 
22:34:10 WE NEED TO LOOK AT HOW MUCH LAND IS BEING USED.

22:34:13 SO THESE DOG PARKS, I THINK ARE GOING TO BE VERY GOOD BECAUSE THEY DON'T USE 
22:34:16 THAT MUCH LAND AND THEY DO GET A LOT OF USE.

22:34:21 AND SO VERY EFFICIENT WAY TO USE LAND.

22:34:25 ALSO THERE'S A LOT OF LAND, A LOT OF TRAILS, A LOT OF OPEN SPACES OUT THERE 
22:34:30 THAT ARE BASICALLY UNDEVELOPED AND ARE BEING USED ALREADY BY PEOPLE FOR 
22:34:35 TRAILS AND CAN BE USED MUCH  MORE.

22:34:41 AND SO YES, I WOULD LIKE TO THANK ALL THE WORK THAT'S GONE INTO THIS, AND AS 
22:34:48 FAR AS CRICKET GOES, I'M THINKING THERE'S NO WAY WE CAN MEET THE DEMAND, 
22:34:52 SO MAYBE WORLD CLASS, YOU KNOW, SOMETHING LIKE EDEN GARDENS OR 
22:35:00 SOMETHING, SOME VERY, VERY HIGH END FACILITIES WOULD BE ABOUT THE ONLY 
22:35:04 THING WE COULD DO BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THAT MUCH LAND, BUT THE LAND WE DO 
22:35:07 HAVE IF WE DO CRICKET COULD BE DONE VERY WELL.

22:35:09 IT COULD BE A TOPNOTCH FACILITY.

22:35:09 THANKS.

22:35:10 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

22:35:12 NEXT SPEAKER IS JANNET BARTON.

22:35:20 >> GOOD EACH.

22:35:24  GOOD EVENING, CITY COUNCIL.

22:35:25 CAN YOU HEAR ME OKAY?

22:35:25 >> Mayor Mei: YES.

22:35:26 >> OKAY.

22:35:32 I'M REALLY HAPPY THAT THE CITY DECIDED TO PUT TOGETHER SUCH AN EXTENSIVE 
22:35:34 MASTER PLAN.

22:35:40 I RETIRED FROM SOFTWARE  ENGINEERING FOR 30 YEARS AND IMMEDIATELY STARTED 
22:35:46 VOLUNTEERING IN OUR WONDERFUL HISTORIC  GARDENS, SHINN PARK AND CALIFORNIA 
22:35:46 NURSERY.

22:35:53 I JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT I LOVE THAT -- EVERYONE ELSE IN THE CITY ALSO 
22:35:59 APPRECIATED OUR HISTORIC PARKS AND THE  VOLUNTEERS AND OUR COMMUNITY GARDENS 
22:36:07 BECAUSE WHAT I SEE IS IT'S A GREAT PLACE FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE COMING INTO 
22:36:17 OUR CITY FROM ELSEWHERE WHO CAN JOIN A GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO ARE HELPING OUT 
22:36:18 WITH ROSES OR WHATEVER.

22:36:22 AND AREN'T WE JUST SO LUCKY TO HAVE THIS INCREDIBLY RICH HISTORY.

22:36:30 I NEVER LIKED HISTORY UNTIL I STARTED WORKING IN OUR HISTORIC PARKS.

22:36:34 I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE THAT OUR TOWN HAS -- FROM THE NATIVE AMERICANS TO THE 
22:36:40 MISSIONS, THE RAIN CHO, THE TRANSCONTINENTAL RAILROAD.

22:36:46 WE WERE SO LUCKY TO HAVE THE RAILROAD AND ALL THE CHINESE WORKERS, THEY 
22:36:50 WORKED FOR THE RAILROAD THEN THEY WORKED FOR THE NURSERIES AND EVERY 
22:36:51 ASPECT OF OUR COMMUNITY.

22:36:54 OUR COMMUNITY WAS SO DIVERSE FROM THE VERY BEGINNING.

22:37:03 SO I JUST -- I'M GLAD THAT THE HISTORIC PARKS WERE RATED  HIGHLY, AND I CAN'T 
22:37:08 WAIT TO HELP THE CITY OUT WITH FUNDRAISING AND WHATEVER NEEDS TO BE 
22:37:11 DONE TO MAKE OUR HISTORIC PARKS EVEN  BETTER.

22:37:12 THANK YOU.

22:37:15 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU, JANNET.

22:37:21 NEXT SPEAKER IS ANANYA.

22:37:24 >> HI, EVERYONE.

22:37:25 CAN YOU HEAR ME OKAY?

22:37:27 >> Mayor Mei: YES.

22:37:28 >> HI.

22:37:32 I'M A JUNIOR AT MISSION SAN JOSÉ HIGH SCHOOL.

22:37:38 LIKE MANY OTHERS ON THIS CALL, I ALSO PLAY CRICKET AND I REMEMBER SO MANY 
22:37:42 WEEKENDS WHERE I'D HAVE TO GO UP TO DAVIS OR MORGAN HILL JUST TO PLAY A 
22:37:44 GAME ON A TURF WHICH KET.

22:37:49 AND IT WOULD BE GREATLY APPRECIATED IF WE COULD HAVE SOME WONDERFUL 
22:37:53 FACILITIES RIGHT HERE IN FREMONT TO PRACTICE AND PLAY, BUT BESIDES THAT, I 
22:37:57 ALSO WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE OVERALL BENEFITS OF HAVING OPEN AREAS IN 
22:37:58 FREMONT.

22:38:03 GROWING UP IN FREMONT, LOCAL PARKS HAVE BEEN TO PLACES THAT I'VE MADE MY 
22:38:07 FONDEST MEMORIES WITH MY FAMILY AND FRIENDS, AND IT'S JUST A GREAT PLACE 
22:38:11 TO IMMERSE YOURSELF IN A CROWD OR JUST TAKING PART IN A PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, 
22:38:13 ESPECIALLY AFTER THE PANDEMIC.

22:38:16 I THINK WE NEED MORE OF THESE EXPERIENCES JUST TO LIKE GET BACK INTO 
22:38:20 SOCIETY AND ADJUST TO THE NEW NORMS AND IMPLEMENTING THIS PLAN WOULD CERTAINLY 
22:38:21 HELP WITH THAT.

22:38:21 THANK YOU.

22:38:24 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

22:38:31 NEXT SPEAKER IS VIRENDRA SWAR.

22:38:32 >> HI.

22:38:34 CAN YOU HEAR ME?

22:38:35 >> Mayor Mei: YES.

22:38:35 >> OKAY.

22:38:37 GOOD EVENING, EVERYONE.

22:38:46 I'VE BEEN A FREMONT RESIDENT FOR THE PAST 20 YEARS, AND HAPPY LIBERATING 
22:38:48 PROPERTY TAXES OVER HERE.

22:38:54 I'M REALLY SUPER STOKED TO SEE THAT FREMONT AS A CITY IS  FINALLY PLANNING 
22:39:00 A MASTER PLAN FOR OPEN SPACES AND TRAILS AND DOG PARKS AND SUF, SO KUDOS 
22:39:06 TO ALL THE LEADERSHIP OF MAYOR MEI, SUSAN, THE PARTNERSHIP WITH  NEELAY 
22:39:10 AND HIS TEAM, YOU GUYS ARE DOING SUCH A GREAT JOB, IT'S REALLY GOOD TO SEE 
22:39:18 THAT A SILICON VALLEY CITY IS NOW  FINALLY LOOKING AT THE NEXT 20, 30 
22:39:23 YEARS AS TO HOW WE CAN PROVIDE BETTER SERVICES TO EVERYBODY IN FREMONT.

22:39:28 THERE WAS SOME MORE TALK ABOUT FREMONT BEING THE HAPPIEST CITY IN THE U.S.

22:39:34 I REALLY HOPE THAT YOU GUYS PASS THIS PLAN, THE MASTER PLAN, AND WE REALLY 
22:39:37 BECOME THE NUMBER ONE CITY IN THE U.S. COUNTRY TO  LIVE.

22:39:43 I REALLY WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT SOMEBODY OVER HERE SAID THAT WE CANNOT 
22:39:48 BUILD WORLD CLASS FACILITIES, I'M SAYING WHY NOT?

22:39:54 WHY CANNOT FREMONT BUILD FIRST CLASS FACILITIES FOR OUR KIDS?

22:39:59 WE DEFINITELY CAN DO THAT WITH PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS AND WE 
22:40:00 SHOULD DEFINITELY DO IT.

22:40:04 I DEFINITELY SUPPORT CRICKET BECAUSE MY KIDS PLAY CRICKET AND I WOULD 
22:40:13 DEFINITELY LIKE TO SEW A THE WORLD CLASS FACILITY -- AROUND THAT -- THANK 
22:40:22 YOU VERY MUCH FOR EVERYTHING YOU GUYS ARE DOING.

22:40:35 >> Ms. Gauthier: AMERICAN HIGH PTSA IS THE LAST SPEAKER.

22:40:39 >> I'VE BEEN RESIDING IN FREMONT FOR 20 YEARS NOW.

22:40:46 WHILE WE LOOK AT PTSAs AND OTHER ORGANIZATIONS TO BUILD COMMUNITIES, I 
22:40:52 THINK THE MASTER PLAN IS REALLY THE PERFECT RESOURCE TO GET THINGS GOING.

22:40:57 WE HAVE GONE TO SAN RAMON AND APPRECIATED THE RESTROOMS THERE.

22:41:02 WE'VE TRAVELED TO MORRISVILLE, NORTH CAROLINA AND HOUSTON AND APPRECIATED 
22:41:03 THE CRICKET FIELDS THERE.

22:41:08 WE'VE GONE TO OTHER DIFFERENT CITIES AND APPRECIATED THE DOG PARKS THERE.

22:41:15 SO NOW IT'S TIME FOR EVERYBODY TO COME TO OUR -- AND SAY FREMONT IS THE PLACE 
22:41:15 TO BE.

22:41:20 THIS IS THE KIND OF STUFF WE NEED TO IMPLEMENT AND THIS IS THE KIND OF CITY 
22:41:22 WE NEED TO BUILD.

22:41:27 SO I AM IN FULL SUPPORT OF THIS MASTER PLAN, AND I REALLY DO HOPE THAT WE GET 
22:41:32 MORE OPEN SPACES FOR OUR KIDS, NOT TO JUST STRESS OUT AT SCHOOL BUT TO 
22:41:35 ACTUALLY HAVE STRES BUSTERS OUTSIDE SCHOOL AS WELL.

22:41:35 THANK YOU.

22:41:47 >> Ms. Gauthier: MAYOR, THAT'S THE LAST SPEAKER.

22:41:47 >> Mayor Mei: GREAT.

22:41:48 THANK YOU.

22:41:52 SO I APOLOGIZE, I'M GOING TO SPEAK FIRST BECAUSE I'M PUSHING 2:00 A.M. 
22:41:52 RIGHT NOW.

22:41:59 SO I'M GOING TO SPEAK FIRST AND THEN I'M SUPPORTIVE OF THE PLAN.

22:42:03 I ALSO WANTED TO NOTE, I MEAN, I DEFINITELY HEARD EVERYONE'S FEEDBACK 
22:42:09 AND HAVING BEEN IN OTHER ROLES, WHETHER IT'S SCHOOL BOARD OR OTHER AREAS, 
22:42:13 WHETHER IT'S THINGS LIKE HISTORIC PARKS, HISTORY HAS DEMONSTRATED AND AS 
22:42:20 WE JUST HAD EARLIER THIS EVENING TALKED ABOUT IN PAST EFFORTS, A LOT OF IT 
22:42:25 DOES TAKE  PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP, AND I'VE SEEN, AND NEELAY, THIS WAS A 
22:42:28 GREAT DEMONSTRATION OF HOW MANY PEOPLE GIVE FEEDBACK ON HOW THEY WANT TO SEE 
22:42:30 THE FACILITIES.

22:42:34 AND I'M GOING TO SHARE A LITTLE BIT OF PERSONAL STUFF FOR  MYSELF, I'M A TEEN 
22:42:38 PARENT SO I'VE DRIVEN OVER THE YEARS, MY KIDS PLAY -- THEY SWIM AND THEY DID 
22:42:45 WATER POLO, SO I KNOW I'VE DRIVEN ALL UP AND DOWN THE STATES, ESPECIALLY FOR 
22:42:47 JUNIOR OLYMPICS I'VE DRIVEN ALL OVER.

22:42:51 ALSO WHEN I THINK ABOUT MY PERSONAL LIFE, I'M VERY GRATEFUL THAT MY MOTHER 
22:42:55 -- PEOPLE MAY OR MAY NOT KNOW ABOUT THIS, I MEAN, SHE WAS VERY KIND AND 
22:42:57 SUPPORTED MY FIGURE SKATING WHEN I WAS YOUNGER.

22:43:01 AND SO I ACTUALLY FIGURE SKATED WHEN I WAS YOUNGER SO I KNOW HOW HARD IT IS 
22:43:04 TO HAVE A PARENT WHO HAS THAT DEDICATION AND LOVE FOR THEIR CHILD, 
22:43:06 AND I'M EXTREMELY GRATEFUL.

22:43:09 BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I WAS GOING TO REALLY ASK, AND I KNOW HOW MANY 
22:43:15 PEOPLE CAME OUT TONIGHT, IS THAT IF WE REALLY DO WANT TO HAVE THE PARK 
22:43:17 FOUNDATIONS MOVING FORWARD AND THE TYPES OF WORLD CLASS FACILITIES THAT 
22:43:21 YOU WANT TO SEE, IT REALLY DOES REQUIRE HOPEFULLY NOT JUST COMING FOR THIS 
22:43:23  MEETING, OR FOR TODAY.

22:43:28 IF YOU WANT TO SEE THESE THINGS HAPPEN, DOG PARKS, HISTORICAL PARKS, AS HARD 
22:43:32 AS IT IS TO MAKE BUDGET CUTS, IT'S ALSO VERY HARD TO IMPLEMENT PROGRAMS THAT 
22:43:33 WE ROLL FORWARD.

22:43:40 SO WE REALLY NEED A CONCERTED EFFORT OF ALL OF YOU AS  CHAMPIONS, AS ADVOCATE, 
22:43:44 AND I'M SO PROUD THAT JUST RECENTLY, WE GOT TO HONOR -- I CAN'T BELIEVE, IT 
22:43:51 MAKES ME FEEL VERY OLD, CHRISTY YAMAGUCHI JUST HAD CELEBRATED THE 30TH 
22:43:56 ANNIVERSARY OF HER FIGURE SKATING AND MOST RECENTLY WE ALSO CELEBRATED KAREN 
22:44:00 CHEN, WE ALSO HAVE PING-PONG AND I KNOW WE'VE HAD FACILITIES BUILT IN THE AREA 
22:44:05 FOR THAT TOO, BUT ALL THESE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS,  PUBLIC/PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS 
22:44:09 AND RECREATION, WE WOULD LOVE TO SEE THE STEPPING UP OF THE COMMUNITY 
22:44:14 MEMBERS, OF THE PTSAs, OF THE PARENTS OF THESE ATHLETES.

22:44:21 ESPECIALLY -- I'M REALLY GRAWT GRATE FULL, FOR EXAMPLE, WE HAVE ROBERT 
22:44:28 TURBIN WHO COMES BACK EVERY TIME, SO WHEN YOU -- TO HELP PAY IT FORWARD AND 
22:44:29 TO HELP GET BACK.

22:44:31 SO THAT'S SOMETHING I'M VERY DEDICATED TO.

22:44:38 WHEN I CAME ON AS THE MAYOR, I MADE THE 10 MINUTE PARK PLEDGE, AND WANTED TO 
22:44:41 MAKE SURE THAT WE HAD ACCESSIBLE, EQUITABLE FACILITIES FOR ALL IN THE 
22:44:41  FUTURE.

22:44:45 AND SO I'M REALLY VERY PASSIONATE AND REALLY EXCITED TO SEE THAT.

22:44:50 AND I LOOK FORWARD TO THAT CONTINUED SUPPORT.

22:44:59 I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG MY COUNCILMEMBERS ARE GOING TO SPEAK, BUT I HAVE A 
22:45:01 FLIGHT TO CATCH SHORTLY IN A LITTLE BIT.

22:45:05 SO I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT I REGISTERED MY VOTE IN SUPPORT OF THIS, 
22:45:11 AND THAT I FULLY WANT TO SEE THIS  HAPPENING, AND I'M VERY EXCITED AND 
22:45:15  I THANK ALL OF YOU, THE PUBLIC, FOR TAKING THE TIME TO PARTICIPATE IN 
22:45:19 GIVING US YOUR FEEDBACK, IN GIVING US YOUR LOVE, BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY, NOW, 
22:45:27 AS WE'VE GOT A PLAN WHICH HASN'T BEEN UPDATED IN 20 YEARS, TO GIVE OF YOUR 
22:45:34 TIME, YOUR MONEY, WHATEVER IT TAKES TO MAKE THIS PLAN THAT HAPPEN, WE NEED 
22:45:38 ALL OF YOU TO STEP UP AND REALLY MAKE THIS HAPPEN.

22:45:41 SO I'M HOPING THAT THIS WILL BE THE CASE, AND I WILL STAY ON FOR A LITTLE 
22:45:46 BIT LONGER, AND I THINK I HAVE SOME OF MY COUNCILMEMBERS WHO ARE ALSO GOING 
22:45:49 TO JOIN IN FULL SUPPORT.

22:45:52 I'M BEING PRESUMPTIVE A LITTLE BIT BUT I'M HOPING THAT'S TO BE THE CASE.

22:45:54 COUNCILMEMBER COX.

22:46:02 >> Councilmember Cox: YES, I FIRST WANTED TO ADDRESS IF IT'S POSSIBLE, 
22:46:04 THERE WAS A QUESTION RAISED BY ONE OF THE SPEAKERS.

22:46:15 I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT THE PUBLIC HAS COME OUT IN VOICE AND SUPPORT.

22:46:21 WE HEAR ABOUT AREAS GOING FORWARD, BUT I DID WANT TO HAVE ADDRESSED -- THERE 
22:46:28 WAS A QUESTION RAISED ABOUT SECURITY IN THE PARK, THAT I DID WANT TO SEE IF WE 
22:46:30 COULD ADDRESS THAT BECAUSE THAT HADN'T BEEN ADDRESSED BEFORE.

22:46:34 >> THANK YOU, COUNCILMEMBER COX, FOR THAT QUESTION.

22:46:38 I FIRST JUST WANT TO TELL KATHRYN HOW SORRY WE ARE FOR HER EXPERIENCES IN 
22:46:39 THE PARK.

22:46:44 THAT WAS A VERY TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCE SHE HAD, AND WE ARE SORRY ANYBODY HAS 
22:46:49 TO SPIRITS ANY DIFFICULTIES IN OUR PARKS.

22:46:54 WE WANT TO REMIND PEOPLE TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO CALL 911 
22:46:59 IMMEDIATELY, AND ALSO THAT THEY ARE THINKING ABOUT THEIR SAFETY IN WALKING 
22:47:03 WITH A FRIEND OR A FAMILY MEMBER WHEN THEY'RE IN PARKS, BUT THAT'S EXACTLY 
22:47:12 WHY, AS WE REDESIGN OUR PARKS, WE WORK WITH OUR -- WE THINK ABOUT REDESIGNS 
22:47:20 SO THEY'RE VISIBLE TO POLICE, ENFORCEMENT, SO THEY CAN BE TRULY NOT 
22:47:31 HIDDEN OR NOT PRO  -- WHEN WE THINK ABOUT OUR -- THAT WE WOULD BE 
22:47:34 REDESIGNING THOSE WITH THAT IN MIND, SO AGAIN I WANT TO THANK KATHRYN FOR 
22:47:38 BRINGING THAT TO OUR ATTENTION TODAY AND AGAIN EXPRESS OUR CONCERN FOR HER 
22:47:40 AND WHAT SHE SHARED WITH US THIS EVENING.

22:47:46 >> Councilmember Cox: AND I DO SECOND THAT, THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE OUR 
22:47:52 PARKS ARE SAFE, AND I THANK SUZANNE FOR BEING ABLE TO EXPLAIN THAT IN A LITTLE 
22:47:53 BIT MORE DETAIL.

22:47:59 AND WE ALSO WANT TO WISH KATHRYN THAT WE HEAR YOU AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE 
22:48:02 THAT IT'S SHARED AMONG ALL OF US THE SAME.

22:48:08 I'M READY TO MAKE A MOTION TO ADOPT THE MASTER PLAN.

22:48:14 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU, BUT I'D LIKE TO HEAR BACK FROM THE REST OF THE 
22:48:15 COUNCIL STILL TOO.

22:48:17 I'LL PUT YOU DOWN FOR MAKING THE MOTION.

22:48:21 COUNCILMEMBER JONES?

22:48:24 >> Councilmember Jones: THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR.

22:48:26 I KNOW IT'S GETTING LATE, PARTICULARLY WHERE YOU ARE.

22:48:30 I JUST -- EVERYBODY HAS SAID EVERYTHING THAT REALLY NEEDS TO BE SAID.

22:48:37 THIS IS AN AMAZING PLAN GOING FORWARD, YOU KNOW, THE CHALLENGE IS GOING TO BE 
22:48:43 IMPLEMENTING ALL OF THIS FINANCIALLY, BUT I'M HOPING WITH THE PARKS 
22:48:47  FOUNDATION, WE CAN GET THAT PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP GOING AND 
22:48:48 GET SOME OF THESE THINGS OFF THE GROUND.

22:48:54 I KNOW SUZANNE CAN, ROGER JUAN, I KNOW YOU'VE GOT TO GET UP IN A FEW HOURS, 
22:49:05 NEELAY, IT'S LATE FOR YOU AS WELL, BUT YOU -- IT  SHOWS.

22:49:09 >> City Mgr. Shackelford: HEY, COUNCILMEMBER JONES, WHAT ABOUT ME?

22:49:13 >> Councilmember Jones: MS. SHAC KELFORD, I'M SORRY.

22:49:16 YOU ARE THE ONE THAT ALLOWS ALL OF THIS TO GET DONE.

22:49:18 >> City Mgr. Shackelford: LOVE IT.

22:49:22 >> Councilmember Jones:EVERYBOD Y HAS WORKED TIRELESSLY ON THIS PROJECT, AND 
22:49:25 I THINK IT'S AMAZING, PUBLIC INPUT.

22:49:30 I DON'T THINK WE'VE EVER SEEN 4,000 RESIDENTS, YOU KNOW, PROVIDE AN 
22:49:33 OPINION ON A LOT OF STUFF THAT GOES ON IN THE CITY.

22:49:37 SO WE'RE OBVIOUSLY VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT THE PARKS, AND CAN'T WAIT TO SEE 
22:49:43 THIS GO FORWARD, AND I'M HAPPY TO SECOND COUNCILMEMBER COX'S MOTION.

22:49:47 >> City Mgr. Shackelford: CAN I JUST SAY, AS SOMEONE WHO GREW UP IN THE 
22:49:53 COMMUNITY, LIKE THE FREMONT PARKS ARE EVERYTHING.

22:50:03 A LITTLE BIT OF NEWARK BECAUSE WE'RE ON THE BORDERLINE, BUT APARENLY WE WENT 
22:50:05 WITH THE COMMUNITY AND I UNDERSTAND.

22:50:07 WE ARE GOOD NEIGHBORS.

22:50:10 I HEARD FROM A COUNCILMEMBER TODAY AND I APPRECIATED THAT, AND WE WILL TAKE 
22:50:13 THAT INTO FOR SURE MOVING FORWARD.

22:50:14 SO ANYWAY.

22:50:24 >> Councilmember Keng: THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR.

22:50:29 THANK YOU, OUR CITY MANAGER, OUR DIRECTOR, EVERYONE, THE WHOLE TEAM'S 
22:50:31 EFFORT IN MAKING THIS PLAN HAPPEN.

22:50:40 AND I DO ALSO WANT TO APPLAUD MAYOR MEI'S MAKING THE 10 MINUTE TO PARK 
22:50:41 PLEDGE.

22:50:50 I THINK THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT, IN THE LAST TWO YEARS OF PANDEMIC, WITH YOU 
22:50:56 SEE HOW MUCH THE NEED IS FOR ALL THESE SPORTING PARKS, YOU KNOW, TRAILS OR 
22:50:58 DOG PARKS.

22:51:06 PEOPLE HAVE BEEN ADOPTING PETS LIKE NO OTHER TIME, SO HENCE THE NEED FOR MORE 
22:51:14 DOG PARKS, SO I THINK THIS IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE REASONS THAT FREMONT IS ONE 
22:51:16 OF THE -- IS THE HAPPIEST CITY IN THE U.S.

22:51:22 SO I WON'T REPEAT A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN SAID, AND I'M HAPPY TO 
22:51:23 SUPPORT THE PLAN.

22:51:23 THANK YOU.

22:51:28 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

22:51:58 WITH THE 25-YEAR PLAN, WE'RE GOING TO TP THIS AND GET THE UPDATES EVERY FIVE 
22:52:01 YEARS, WHICH WE HAVEN'T DONE IN THE PAST, AND I THINK IT'S REALLY CRITICAL.

22:52:08 HAPPEN.
