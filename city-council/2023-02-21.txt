[Captioner] 19:09:32
>> I'M SPEAKING

[Captioner] 19:09:35
 FOR -- ON DIWALI
FESTIVAL BEING

[Captioner] 19:09:38
 A HINDU FESTIVAL, HOW WE
CAN HAVE THAT RECOGNIZED AS A HOLIDAY IN


[Captioner] 19:09:42
THE U.S.
DIWALI IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT
FESTIVALS AND WIDE

[Captioner] 19:09:48
LY
CELEBRATED IN INDIA.
IT'S

[Captioner] 19:09:51
 ALSO SIKH AND -- FESTIVAL AS WELL.
THE

[Captioner] 19:09:56
 'FESSIVELY OF LIGHT IS FOR THE

[Captioner] 19:09:58
 GOOD
OF THE HEAVENS AND A TIME WHEN FAMILIES


[Captioner] 19:10:01
COME TOGETHER AND THEY EXCHANGE GIFTS
AND SHARE TRADITIONAL FOOD AS WELL.


[Captioner] 19:10:05
THERE ARE SEVERAL REASONS, ONE OF THE
MOST IMPORTANT ONES

[Captioner] 19:10:08
 IS LIKE AS WE HAVE A
LOT OF INDIAN POPULATION

[Captioner] 19:10:11
 IN THIS AREA,
MORE THAN 70% IN FREMONT

[Captioner] 19:10:14
, AND ALSO A LOT
OF PARTICIPATION INTO THE CULTURAL,

[Captioner] 19:10:17

ECONOMIC AND ORAL WELL-BEING IN THE
CITY.


[Captioner] 19:10:21
IT'S ACTUALLY -- WILL BE GOOD HONOR

[Captioner] 19:10:24
 FOR
THE POPULATION TO BE HAVING THIS

[Captioner] 19:10:27

RECOGNIZED AS A HOLIDAY IN THE CITY.


[Captioner] 19:10:30
I SEE THAT THERE HAVE BEEN OCCASIONS
WHERE DIWALI

[Captioner] 19:10:34
 FESTIVAL

[Captioner] 19:10:38
 WHILE AT THE SAME
TIME NOT FEELING PART OF THE FESTIVAL
CELEBRATIONS AT HOME HAVE

[Captioner] 19:10:41
 ALSO PUT ME AT
KIND OF FULFILLING AM I BEING

[Captioner] 19:10:44
 PART OF
THE COMMUNITY.
ANOTHER REASON IS ALSO

[Captioner] 19:10:48
 THAT BEING A
COUNTRY OF

[Captioner] 19:10:52
 INCLUSIVITY IN THE UNITED
STATES ACTUALLY IT'S A WELL-KNOWN FACT


[Captioner] 19:10:55
THAT WE HONOR AND ACKNOWLEDGE ALL
COMMUNITIES

[Captioner] 19:10:58
 AND ON THAT BEHALF ALSO I
WOULD SAY IT'S A GOOD

[Captioner] 19:11:02
 REASON THAT
FREMONT CITY SHOULD LOOK FOR ACKNOWLEDGE

[Captioner] 19:11:05

DIWALI TO INDIAN FESTIVAL AND SHOULD BE

[Captioner] 19:11:08

DECLARED AS A HOLIDAY AND FINALLY BEING


[Captioner] 19:11:11
A GOOD GESTURE IN THE GROWING ECONOMY, A
GOOD FRIEND,

[Captioner] 19:11:15
 GOOD PARTNER AND GOOD
GESTURE OF ACKNOWLEDGMENT THAT

[Captioner] 19:11:18
 COULD BE
A

 MAYOR
TERESA KENG AND ALL THE AMAZING CITY
COUNCILMEMBERS, THANK YOU FOR

[Captioner] 19:11:39
 THIS
OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THE
DIWALI

[Captioner] 19:11:42
 FESTIVAL.
I LIVE IN FREMONT FOR THE LAST 30 YEARS

[Captioner] 19:11:44

AND HAVE BEEN SERVING THE COMMUNITY FOR


[Captioner] 19:11:47
THAT.
AND I JUST CAME HERE TO TALK ABOUT IT A


[Captioner] 19:11:50
LITTLE BIT.
THE HINDU FESTIVAL OF LIGHTS HAS GROWN


[Captioner] 19:11:54
BEYOND BOTH HINDUISM AND INDIA, AND IS
NOW

[Captioner] 19:11:57
 OBSERVED ACROSS SOUTH AND SOUTHEAST
ASIA AND CELEBRATED BY OTHER

[Captioner] 19:12:01
 RELIGIONS.
INCLUDING -- AND

[Captioner] 19:12:04
 MUSLIMS.
WITH THE UNITED STATES, THE POPULATION


[Captioner] 19:12:07
HAS BEEN GROWING PRETTY

[Captioner] 19:12:10
 ASTRONOMICALLY,
POPULATION GREW IN

[Captioner] 19:12:12
 ITALY 13 FOLD IN THIS
COMING LAST YEAR ITSELF, LAST FEW
YEARS.


[Captioner] 19:12:16
THE HOLIDAY IS ALSO INCREASINGLY
CELEBRATED ACROSS AMERICA.


[Captioner] 19:12:21
OBSERVING DIWALI AS A PUBLIC HOLIDAY IS
A

[Captioner] 19:12:24
 VERY, VERY SIGNIFICANT FOR PEOPLE TO
BE ABLE TO ENGAGE

[Captioner] 19:12:28
 IN THE VARIOUS RITUALS

[Captioner] 19:12:31

AND CELEBRATIONS THAT TAKE PLACE FOR
THOSE IN THE AFTERNOONS AND IN THE

[Captioner] 19:12:35

EVENINGS.
SO I REALLY DO HOPE THAT YOU'LL

[Captioner] 19:12:36
 MAKE
DIWALI A PUBLIC HOLIDAY SO THAT INDIAN


[Captioner] 19:12:40
AMERICANS EVERYWHERE ACROSS FREMONT
REALLY GET THE CHANCE TO ENGAGE WITH

[Captioner] 19:12:44
 THE
HINDU FAITH AND TRADITIONS.
AND SHARE

[Captioner] 19:12:47
 THAT ON TO THE PEERS AS

[Captioner] 19:12:50
 WELL
WHO AREN'T NECESSARILY HINDU BUT WHO
COULD REALLY

[Captioner] 19:12:53
 GAIN FROM BEING IN CONTACT
WITH THE HINDUS AND UNDERSTAND

[Captioner] 19:12:57
 THE
CULTURAL DIFFERENCES AND IN A MORE CULL

[Captioner] 19:13:01

CULTURALLY

[Captioner] 19:13:04
 IMMERSIVE ENVIRONMENT WE ALL
SHOULD WORK ON HIGHLIGHTING THE VALUE OF

[Captioner] 19:13:08

INTERSECTION OF RELIGION IN LIFE.
THIS IS

[Captioner] 19:13:11
 LINKED WITH THE ANCIENT RELIGION
OF MANY OTHER THINGS

[Captioner] 19:13:14
 I DON'T WANT TO
TALK ABOUT BECAUSE I'M SURE OTHER
SPEAKER ALSO TALK ABOUT,

[Captioner] 19:13:17
 AND BEING A
RESIDENT HERE AGAIN, I THINK

[Captioner] 19:13:20
 IT'S VERY
IMPORTANT TO REALLY

[Captioner] 19:13:24
 TALK ABOUT DIWALI
AND I'M RUNNING OUT OF TIME BUT IT'S
GOOD

[Captioner] 19:13:27
 FOR THE SECOND GENERATION KIDS AS
WELL.
I REALLY HOPE YOU'LL

[Captioner] 19:13:30
 VOTE FOR IT AND
MAKE IT A HOLIDAY.

 I LIVE WITHIN IT.
EVEN THOUGH I'VE BEEN

[Captioner] 19:14:00

SEEN THAT AS

OTHER COUNTRIES,

[Captioner] 19:14:07
 I'VE LIVED IN MANY
DIFFERENT INTERNATIONAL COUNTRIES AND

[Captioner] 19:14:09
 AS
COMPARED TO MY TIME IN THE U.S., I FELT

[Captioner] 19:14:17
 PLAY
DIWALI AND BE A PART OF THE FESTIVAL
ALONG WITH MY RES

[Captioner] 19:14:20
 TIFS IN BIGGER

[Captioner] 19:14:23
 THE FUTURE I

[Captioner] 19:17:01
FLOATING HOLIDAY, IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE
A DEDICATED

[Captioner] 19:17:04
 ONE, AND THAT WAY IT'S NOT
GOING TO BE AN EXPENSIVE THING FOR CITY,

[Captioner] 19:17:08

BUT IT WILL DO A LOT FOR

[Captioner] 19:17:11
 COMMUNITY TO
REALLY GET CONNECTED AND FEEL PROUD

 OF
BEING BELONGING HERE.

[Captioner] 19:17:45
 SIGNIFICANCE.
IT JUST STANDS FOR

[Captioner] 19:17:48
 DRIVING DARKNESS OUT
OF OUR LIVES AND BRINGING LIGHT TO

[Captioner] 19:17:52
 US.
WHICH IS -- WHICH MAKES A LOT OF SENSE

[Captioner] 19:17:54

IN TODAY'S WORLD WHERE THERE ARE SO MANY


[Captioner] 19:17:57
ISSUES THAT WE HAVE TO COLLECTIVELY
UNITEDLY FIGHT

[Captioner] 19:18:01
 AGAINST.
SO THERE IS THE SIGNIFICANCE

[Captioner] 19:18:04
 AND
SANCTITY OF THIS FESTIVAL TO UNITE US

[Captioner] 19:18:07

ALL TOGETHER IN A COMMUNITY.
SO IRRESPECTIVE OF WHETHER IT IS

[Captioner] 19:18:11
 A HINDU
FESTIVAL OR NOT, THE MEANING

[Captioner] 19:18:14
 OF IT IS
EXTREMELY

[Captioner] 19:18:17
 RELEVANT TO PRESENT
CIRCUMSTANCES AND TIMES

THANK YOU VERY MUCH.


[Captioner] 19:20:47
>> Ms. Gauthier: THANK YOU.
THE NEXT SPEAKER IS

[Captioner] 19:20:51
 RENU NAIR, FOLLOWED
BY STEVE SCALA.


[Captioner] 19:20:58
>> NAMASTE, EVERYONE.
I'M CURRENTLY A

[Captioner] 19:21:01
 JUNIOR AT IRVINGTON HIGH
SCHOOL.
I AM HERE TODAY

[Captioner] 19:21:05
 RECOGNIZING DIWALI TO BE
A PUBLIC SCHOOL HOLIDAY

[Captioner] 19:21:08
 AND WE'RE GOING
TO BE DISCUSSING THIS.
SO IN

[Captioner] 19:21:11
 2022, THE CITY OF NEW YORK
ANNOUNCED AND DECLARED DIWALI TO BE

[Captioner] 19:21:15
 A
PUBLIC SCHOOL HOLIDAY.
HOWEVER, WE CAN SEE THAT

[Captioner] 19:21:18
 FREMONT DESPITE
HAVING A HIGH HINDU

[Captioner] 19:21:21
 POPULATION HAS
CONTINUED TO UNRECOGNIZE DIWALI TO BE A

[Captioner] 19:21:25

HOLIDAY.
AND THIS HAS MANY NEGATIVE

[Captioner] 19:21:28
 IMPLICATIONS
FOR HINDU STUDENTS, WITH MANY BEING
FORCED TO ESSENTIALLY

[Captioner] 19:21:33
 ATTEND SCHOOL OR
CELEBRATE THIS JOYOUS OCCASION

[Captioner] 19:21:36
 WITH
THEIR FAMILY AND FRIENDS.
NOW, WITH MANY STUDENTS TAKING A.P.


[Captioner] 19:21:39
COURSES OR HONORS PROGRAMS THIS CAN
LEAVE MANY STUDENTS BEHIND IN TERMS

[Captioner] 19:21:42
 OF
ACADEMICS, WHERE ONE DAY IS JUST ENOUGH


[Captioner] 19:21:45
TO FALL BEHIND.
OR IT CAN MAKE MANY STUDENTS FEEL

[Captioner] 19:21:48
 LONELY
AS WE'RE NOT ABLE TO CELEBRATE THIS
JOYOUS

[Captioner] 19:21:51
 OCCASION WITH OUR FRIENDS AND OUR
PEERS.
ADDITIONALLY, DIWALI IS A

[Captioner] 19:21:55
 FESTIVAL WHERE
HINDU FAMILIES OFTEN PERFORM

[Captioner] 19:21:58
 ACTS OF
SERVICE CALLED SAVA, AND THESE ACTS OF


[Captioner] 19:22:01
SERVICE ARE ESSENTIALLY THINGS THAT WE
DO TO BENEFIT THOSE THAT ARE IN NEED IN

[Captioner] 19:22:04

THE COMMUNITY.
WE CAN SEE THIS HAS A VERY

[Captioner] 19:22:07
 POSITIVE
BENEFIT FOR STUDENTS AS THEY'RE ABLE TO


[Captioner] 19:22:10
HAVE A LOT OF REAL WORLD EXPERIENCE
WORKING WITH THESE COMMUNITIES AS

[Captioner] 19:22:13
 WELL
AS WITH THE COMMUNITY THAT'S OBVIOUSLY


[Captioner] 19:22:16
THEY'RE GETTING, YOU KNOW, SERVICE.
ADDITIONALLY

[Captioner] 19:22:19
 DIWALI IS AN IMPORTANT
FESTIVAL FOR THE ENTIRETY OF INDIA, AND


[Captioner] 19:22:23
ONCE AGAIN, FREMONT HAS A HIGH INDIAN
POPULATION

[Captioner] 19:22:26
.
AND RECOGNIZING THIS HOLIDAY IS KEY TO

[Captioner] 19:22:28

ACKNOWLEDGING AND RECOGNIZING THE HINDU


[Captioner] 19:22:31
COMMUNITY AND ITS VAST CULTURE.
AND THIS ALSO SHOWS THAT POLICY

[Captioner] 19:22:35
 MAKERS
SUPPORT THIS HINDU COMMUNITY AND IT
MAKES US AS A

[Captioner] 19:22:38
 COMMUNITY AND ME AS A
STUDENT FEEL HEARD.
AND HENCE AS

[Captioner] 19:22:42
 A HINDU TEENAGER AS WELL AS
A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE HINDU

[Captioner] 19:22:45
 STUDENT
BODY, I KINDLY URGE YOU ALL TO MAKE
DIWALI

[Captioner] 19:22:48
 A PUBLIC SCHOOL HOLIDAY.
I YIELD THE

[Captioner] 19:22:51
 REST OF MY TIME, THANK YOU.
NAMASTE.


[Captioner] 19:22:55
>> Ms. Gauthier: THE NEXT SPEAKER IS
STEVE SCALA FOLLOWED BY

[Captioner] 19:23:00
 DR. RAMESH
JOPRA.
>> THANK YOU, COUNCIL, MADAME

[Captioner] 19:23:03
 MAYOR,
STEVE SKALA, RESIDENT OF FREMONT.
LAST

[Captioner] 19:23:07
 FEBRUARY 7TH YOU HAD A DISCUSSION
ON PROTECTED INTERSECTIONS AND I'D LIKE

[Captioner] 19:23:10

TO COMMENT ON.
THERE ARE MANY

[Captioner] 19:23:13
 QUESTIONS INCLUDING FROM
FREMONT STAFF REGARDING

[Captioner] 19:23:15
 THE
EFFECTIVENESS OF PROTECTED
INTERSECTIONS.


[Captioner] 19:23:18
HERE I WANT TO MAKE CLEAR YOU DON'T NEED
TO DO DESIGN

[Captioner] 19:23:21
 EXPERIMENTS WITHIN THE CITY
OF FREMONT TO DETERMINE THE PURPOSE AND


[Captioner] 19:23:24
EFFECTIVENESS OF PROTECTED
INTERSECTIONS.
PROTECTED INTERSECTIONS HAVE BEEN 

[Captioner] 19:23:27
USED
FOR MORE THAN 15 YEARS, AND HAVE BEEN
DESCRIBED AND STUDIED BY OTHERS

[Captioner] 19:23:31
 ALL OVER
THE WORLD AND WERE ESPECIALLY DESIGNED

[Captioner] 19:23:34

TO PROTECT PEDESTRIANS.
RESOURCES YOU CAN LOOK AT ARE THE

[Captioner] 19:23:37
 U.S.
DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION, SAFE
SYSTEMS

[Captioner] 19:23:41
 APPROACH AND SAFE ROADS, THERE
ARE ALSO HALF

[Captioner] 19:23:44
 A DOZEN TRAFFIC CENTERS
AND MAJOR UNIVERSITIES

[Captioner] 19:23:47
 INCLUDING CAL
BERKELEY ALL HAVE RESEARCH AND
INFORMATION ON

[Captioner] 19:23:50
 PROTECTED INTERSECTIONS.
PUSHBACK

[Captioner] 19:23:53
 AGAINST SAFETY CHANGES ARE
WELL-KNOWN AND THERE'S

[Captioner] 19:23:57
 RESEARCH ON THAT
TOO.
SOME ARE

[Captioner] 19:24:00
 ALWAYS AVERSE TO CHANGE FOR A
VARIETY OF REASONS AND MANY OF YOU ARE

[Captioner] 19:24:03

HEARING THAT, BUT I'M HEARING VERY
ONE-SIDED DATA FROM SOME.


[Captioner] 19:24:06
PLEASE LOOK AT THE OTHER SIDE.
GO TO ASSISTED LIVING FACILITY DOWN

[Captioner] 19:24:10
 THE
STREET, PUSH A SENIOR THROUGH

[Captioner] 19:24:13
 SOME OF
THE DIFFERENT INTERSECTIONS AND ASK
THEIR OPINIONS.


[Captioner] 19:24:16
ALSO TALK TO SOMEONE WHO DOES NOT OWN A
CAR AND ASK

[Captioner] 19:24:19
 WHAT THEY THINK OF TRANSIT
IN THE CITY, AND YES, THERE ARE MANY
PEOPLE

[Captioner] 19:24:23
 WHO DO NOT WANT A CAR OR CANNOT
AFFORD A CAR AND SPEAK

[Captioner] 19:24:26
 TO MOMS WHO WOULD
LIKE THEIR KIDS TO WALK OR BIKE TO

[Captioner] 19:24:29

SCHOOL.
THIS IS DATA FROM FREMONT.


[Captioner] 19:24:32
YOU CAN GET IT FROM CAL BERKELEY'S
DATABASE.
IT'S OPEN

[Captioner] 19:24:36
 TO THE PUBLIC, TRAFFIC
FATALITIES IN FREMONT FILTERED

[Captioner] 19:24:39
 TO LOCAL
STREETS FOR THE LAST 10 YEARS AND 75

[Captioner] 19:24:42

TOTAL FATALITIES, 40, MORE THAN HALF,

[Captioner] 19:24:45

ARE PEDESTRIANS AND BICYCLISTS.
OF THESE, THE VAST

[Captioner] 19:24:48
 MAJORITY ARE
PEDESTRIANS.
SO IF YOU TAKE A

[Captioner] 19:24:52
 SENIOR OUT, CROSS THE
STREETS, MAKE SURE

[Captioner] 19:24:55
 YOU LOOK BOTH WAYS
BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT ANYBODY TO ADD TO


[Captioner] 19:24:58
THESE DATASETS.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:25:01
>> Ms. Gauthier: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:25:05
DR. RAMESH JOPRA FOLLOWED BY

[Captioner] 19:25:07
 AVIA
CHOPRA.


[Captioner] 19:25:10
>> GOOD EVENING, MAYOR, COUNCILMEMBERS.
YOU'VE HEARD A

[Captioner] 19:25:13
 LOT ON OUR

[Captioner] 19:25:16
 CULTURE, OUR
DIWALI PROGRAMS.
I'M HERE TO

[Captioner] 19:25:20
 FIRST CONGRATULATE ALL THE
COUNCILMEMBERS FOR

[Captioner] 19:25:23
 RECOGNIZING BLACK
HISTORY

[Captioner] 19:25:26
 DAY, AND THE

[Captioner] 19:25:30
 CEREMONIAL FLAG
OBSERVANCE OF THE BLACK FLAG.


[Captioner] 19:25:33
I THINK THIS IS A GREAT START,

[Captioner] 19:25:36

RECOGNIZING THE COMMUNITY'S DIFFERENT
ETHNICITIES, DIFFERENT

[Captioner] 19:25:40
 MINORITIES.
AS MANY PEOPLE HAVE SAID THAT CITY OF

[Captioner] 19:25:44

FREMONT HAS TRANSFORM

[Captioner] 19:25:48
ED OVER THE LAST

[Captioner] 19:25:51

YEARS I'VE BEEN HERE, MANY OF OUR
COMMUNITIES

[Captioner] 19:25:55
 HAVE COME FORWARD, COME UP
AND NOW YOU

[Captioner] 19:25:58
 CAN SEE MANY OF OUR CHILDREN
ARE

[Captioner] 19:26:01
 FEELING THAT THEY'RE REALLY NOT
GETTING

[Captioner] 19:26:05
 THE RIGHT RECOGNITION, SO I
WOULD REQUEST THAT WE SHOULD BRING IT
UP, ALL

[Captioner] 19:26:09
 THE OTHER ETHNICITIES AS WELL,
ALL THE

[Captioner] 19:26:13
 ETHNIC GROUPS, ESPECIALLY THE
ASIAN AMERICANS, INDIAN

[Captioner] 19:26:16
 AMERICANS, HINDU
AMERICANS, AND WHATEVER

[Captioner] 19:26:19
 THEIR MAIN DAY

[Captioner] 19:26:22

OF THE YEAR IS SHOULD BE RECOGNIZED,
SHOULD BE

[Captioner] 19:26:26
 PRONOUNCED AS A OFFICIAL
HOLIDAY SO THAT ALL THE

[Captioner] 19:26:30
 FAMILIES AND
EVERYBODY ELSE CAN COME TO KNOW IN THE


[Captioner] 19:26:33
CITY SO WE CAN ALL UNITE TOGETHER
THROUGH

[Captioner] 19:26:36
 THESE CULTURES, THROUGH THESE
FESTIVALS, THROUGH THESE

[Captioner] 19:26:39
 HOLIDAYS, AND
KNOW OUR HISTORY.
KNOWING EACH

[Captioner] 19:26:42
 OTHER'S HISTORY, LEARNING
FROM IT AND MOVING FORWARD IS THE WAY

[Captioner] 19:26:45

THAT CITY OF FREMONT CAN SET AN

[Captioner] 19:26:49
 EXAMPLE,
SET UP THE BENCHMARK WHERE EVERYBODY
ELSE CAN

[Captioner] 19:26:52
 FOLLOW.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:26:56
>> Ms. Gauthier: THANK YOU.
THE LAST SPEAKER IS AVIA

[Captioner] 19:27:00
 CHOPRA.
>> City Mgr. Shackelford: AS THAT
SPEAKER IS COMING UP, I'D LIKE

[Captioner] 19:27:03
 TO MAKE A
POINT OF CLARIFICATION.
WHILE WE DON'T TYPICALLY RESPOND TO

[Captioner] 19:27:07

PUBLIC COMMENT, I DO JUST WANT TO
CLARIFY THAT THE

[Captioner] 19:27:10
 CITY DOES NOT HAVE
JURISDICTION

[Captioner] 19:27:15
 OVER THE SCHOOL DISTRICT'S
HOLIDAYS.
SO I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR ABOUT

[Captioner] 19:27:18
 THAT.


[Captioner] 19:27:23
>> GOOD EVENING, ESTEEMED
COUNCILMEMBERS.
MY NAME IS

[Captioner] 19:27:26
 AVIA CHOPRA, I'M 12 YEARS
OLD.
I GO TO PATTERSON

[Captioner] 19:27:29
 ELEMENTARY, AND I WAS
BORN AND RAISED IN FREMONT, CALIFORNIA.


[Captioner] 19:27:34
TODAY I WOULD LIKE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT
THE IMPORTANCE OF DIWALI AS

[Captioner] 19:27:37
 A HOLIDAY
AND WHY IT SHOULD BE RECOGNIZED.
DIWALI ALSO

[Captioner] 19:27:40
 KNOWN AS THE FESTIVAL OF
LIGHT IS ONE OF THE MOST

[Captioner] 19:27:43
 SIGNIFICANT
CELEBRATIONS IN THE HINDU CALENDAR

[Captioner] 19:27:46
.
IT IS A TIME OF JOY, HAPPINESS AND

[Captioner] 19:27:48

TOGETHERNESS AS FAMILIES COME TOGETHER


[Captioner] 19:27:51
TO CELEBRATE THE TRIUMPH OF GOOD OVER
EVIL.
AS WE ALL

[Captioner] 19:27:54
 KNOW, HOLIDAYS ARE ESSENTIAL
FOR REST, REJUVENATION AND SPENDING TIME

[Captioner] 19:27:58

WITH OUR LOVED ONES.
BUT DIWALI IS MORE

[Captioner] 19:28:01
 THAN JUST A HOLIDAY.
IT IS A CULTURAL AND SPIRITUAL

[Captioner] 19:28:03
 EVENT
THAT CELEBRATE THE VICTORY OF KNOWLEDGE


[Captioner] 19:28:07
OVER IGNORANCE AND HOPE OVER DESPAIR.
IT

[Captioner] 19:28:10
 SYMBOLIZES THE POWER OF UNITY,
COMPASSION AND

[Captioner] 19:28:13
 FORGIVENESS.
RECOGNIZING DIWALI AS A HOLIDAY IS

[Captioner] 19:28:17
 NOT
ONLY A SIGN OF RESPECT FOR THE HINDU
COMMUNITY

[Captioner] 19:28:20
 BUT ALSO A RECOGNITION

[Captioner] 19:28:25
 OF
THE VALUES DIWALI REPRESENTS.


[Captioner] 19:28:28
BY ACKNOWLEDGING THE FESTIVAL AS A
HOLIDAY, WE ARE SENDING A MESSAGE

[Captioner] 19:28:31
 OF
INCLUSIVENESS AND DIVERSITY AND WE ARE


[Captioner] 19:28:34
PROMOTING THE IDEA THAT ALL CULTURES AND
TRADITIONS ARE EQUALLY IMPORTANT AND

[Captioner] 19:28:37

DESERVING OF RECOGNITION.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:28:44

>> Ms. Gauthier: THAT'S THE LAST
SPEAKER.


[Captioner] 19:28:47
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
I WANTED TO LET

[Captioner] 19:28:51
 PEOPLE -- JUST A GENERAL
COMMENT IS THAT IF YOU'RE EVER
INTERESTED

[Captioner] 19:28:54
 IN ADDRESSING THE SCHOOLS AND
CITY JOINTLY, WE ACTUALLY DO HAVE

[Captioner] 19:28:57
 JOINT
QUARTERLY, THE NEXT ONE WILL BE

[Captioner] 19:29:00
 MAY,
MEETINGS, AND ALSO THERE'S A
SUBCOMMITTEE BETWEEN

[Captioner] 19:29:03
 THE SCHOOL DISTRICT
AND THE CITY COUNCIL, AND THE NEXT ONE


[Captioner] 19:29:07
WILL BE NEXT

[Captioner] 19:29:09
 TUESDAY AT THE SCHOOL
DISTRICT'S OFFICE OR IS IT OURS THIS
TIME?


[Captioner] 19:29:12
>> Ms. Gauthier: IT OURS.
>> Mayor Mei: IT'S RIGHT HERE, WHERE
YOU

[Captioner] 19:29:15
 CAN RETURN, AND THAT'S A JOINT
MEETING, AND I BELIEVE THAT'S

[Captioner] 19:29:19
 AT --
>> Ms. Gauthier: IT'S LIAISON
COMMITTEE WHERE IT'S TWO

[Captioner] 19:29:23
 COUNCILMEMBERS,
TWO SCHOOL BOARD MEMBERS ON THE 28TH AT

[Captioner] 19:29:24

5:30.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:29:27
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SHARING.
I JUST WANTED TO

[Captioner] 19:29:30
 GIVE THAT
INFORMATIONAL.
AND AT THIS TIME, WE DO NOT

[Captioner] 19:29:33
 RESPOND TO
LET PEOPLE KNOW, TO ORAL COMMUNICATIONS


[Captioner] 19:29:36
BUT WE CERTAINLY APPRECIATE EVERYONE'S
COMMENTS AND THEY ARE DEFINITELY HEARD.


[Captioner] 19:29:40
AT THIS TIME WE'LL RETURN TO
CONSIDERATION OF ITEMS THAT WERE

[Captioner] 19:29:43
 REMOVED
FROM THE CONSENT CALENDAR.
I

[Captioner] 19:29:47
 BELIEVE WE HAD TWO ITEMS REMOVED BY
THE

[Captioner] 19:29:50
 PUBLIC.
>> Ms. Gauthier: MR. ABREU REMOVED
ITEM 2E

[Captioner] 19:29:53
 AND ALSO 2G.


[Captioner] 19:29:57
>> Mayor Mei: WELCOME.
>> OKAY.


[Captioner] 19:30:02
SO THE 2E WAS THE ANIMAL ORDINANCE.
A

[Captioner] 19:30:05
 COUPLE OF THINGS TO NOTE ABOUT THIS.
IT'S BEING SLIPPED

[Captioner] 19:30:08
 INTO THE CONSENT
CALENDAR HERE, AND

[Captioner] 19:30:11
 THIS BEEKEEPING THING
WAS FIRST

[Captioner] 19:30:15
 CAME OUT AS A REFERRAL,
SOMETHING LIKE TWO YEARS AGO,

[Captioner] 19:30:18
 AND THEN
THERE WAS ONE SET OF ADJUSTMENTS TO THE

[Captioner] 19:30:21

ANIMAL ORDINANCE A WHILE BACK BUT

[Captioner] 19:30:24
 THAT
TOOK WELL OVER A YEAR, AND NOW HERE WE


[Captioner] 19:30:27
ARE WITH ANOTHER SET OF ADJUSTMENTS TO
THE ANIMAL

[Captioner] 19:30:30
 ORDINANCE, WHICH IS
BEEKEEPING, AND THAT'S BEEN TAKING,

[Captioner] 19:30:34

WHAT, TWO YEARS?
SO THE

[Captioner] 19:30:37
 LONG DELAY HERE IS --

[Captioner] 19:30:40
 IT'S
EMBLEMATIC OF HOW LONG IT TAKES TO GET


[Captioner] 19:30:43
REFERRALS ADDRESSED.
AND

[Captioner] 19:30:47
 BUT LET'S TALK ABOUT BEEKEEPING.
WHAT YOU HEARD

[Captioner] 19:30:50
 FROM A LOT OF PEOPLE TWO
YEARS AGO WAS THESE ANIMAL

[Captioner] 19:30:54
 RESTRICTIONS
WERE ONEROUS.
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE TAXING EVERYTHING,


[Captioner] 19:30:58
YOU'RE PUTTING IN PERMITS AND

[Captioner] 19:31:01

RESTRICTIONS.
THESE PERMITS

[Captioner] 19:31:04
 COST 50 OR $80 A YEAR,
THEY'RE SENDING OUT GOVERNMENT

[Captioner] 19:31:08
 EMPLOYEES
TO GO INSPECT PEOPLE

[Captioner] 19:31:12
'S ANIMAL PLACES OR
BEEKEEPING

[Captioner] 19:31:16
 PLACES, CHICKEN ROOSTING
PLACES, WHATEVER THEY HAVE.
THERE WAS A

[Captioner] 19:31:20
 LOT OF THIS KIND OF STUFF,
AND SO NOW YOU'RE GETTING RID OF

[Captioner] 19:31:23
 THESE
BEEKEEPING PERMITS.


[Captioner] 19:31:26
THAT'S WHAT'S HERE, BURIED IN THE
CONSENT CALENDAR.
THAT'S A GOOD

[Captioner] 19:31:29
 THING.
AND NOW LET'S MOVE

[Captioner] 19:31:33
 ON -- AM I AT

[Captioner] 19:31:37

>> Councilmember Kassan: YES.


[Captioner] 19:31:52
I AGREE, IT TOOK A VERY LONG TIME, AND
THERE

[Captioner] 19:31:55
 ARE STILL SOME THINGS IN THE
ORDINANCE -- IN THE ANIMAL ORDINANCE
THAT

[Captioner] 19:31:59
 I  FIND --

[Captioner] 19:32:02
 THAT I DON'T THINK
ARE IDEAL BUT I WAS VERY HAPPY TO SEE

[Captioner] 19:32:06

THE PROCESS THAT HAPPENED WITH THIS
PARTICULAR PART OF THE

[Captioner] 19:32:10
 ORDINANCE.
THE FOLKS WHO ARE

[Captioner] 19:32:13
 EXPERTS ON BEEKEEPING
GOT TOGETHER WITH STAFF AND CAME TO

[Captioner] 19:32:17
 A
CONCLUSION THAT EVERYONE SEEMS VERY
HAPPY WITH SO I'M

[Captioner] 19:32:20
 REALLY, REALLY GLAD WE
GET TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN TONIGHT.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:32:25
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
NEXT IS COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN.
>> Councilmember Salwan: I'D LIKE

[Captioner] 19:32:29

MOVE THIS ITEM FORWARD.


[Captioner] 19:32:32
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:32:34
>> Councilmember Cox: SECOND.
>> Mayor Mei: SECONDED BY
COUNCILMEMBER COX.


[Captioner] 19:32:38
THIS IS AN ITEM, AGAIN TO

[Captioner] 19:32:41
 CLARIFY, 2E.


[Captioner] 19:32:45
>> FRIENDLY REMINDER I'LL NEED TO READ
IT INTO THE

[Captioner] 19:32:47
 RECORD.
>> Mayor Mei: YES.
WOULD YOU LIKE TO READ THE ORDINANCE 

[Captioner] 19:32:51
AT
THIS TIME?
>> THIS EVENING

[Captioner] 19:32:54
 THE COUNCIL IS
CONSIDERING FOR INTRODUCTION AN
ORDINANCE OF THE CITY OF FREMONT

[Captioner] 19:32:58
 ADDING
FREMONT -- AMENDING FREMONT CODE

[Captioner] 19:33:01
 TITLE

[Captioner] 19:33:04

6 SECTION 6.05.010 AND

[Captioner] 19:33:07
 ADDING SECTION
6.1.140 AND REPEALING

[Captioner] 19:33:11
 SECTION 6.40.040.
THANK YOU, MAYOR.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:33:14
WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND.
MAY I PLEASE

[Captioner] 19:33:17
 CALL THE VOTE.


[Captioner] 19:33:22
THE MOTION PASSES UNANIMOUSLY.


[Captioner] 19:33:26
NEXT WE ALSO HAVE ANOTHER ITEM PULLED.
I BELIEVE IT

[Captioner] 19:33:29
 WAS ITEM 2G AS

[Captioner] 19:33:33
 IN GEORGE,
TO ADOPT A RESOLUTION TO EXECUTE A
LETTER OF INTENT WITH

[Captioner] 19:33:35
 THE ALAMEDA COUNTY
FIRE DEPARTMENT.
WELCOME.


[Captioner] 19:33:39
>> SO THIS IS

[Captioner] 19:33:43
 A BIG GAP IN OVERSIGHT BY
THE

[Captioner] 19:33:46
 CITY.
WHERE THERE HAS BEEN

[Captioner] 19:33:50
 FOR SEVERAL YEARS
LAPSES IN

[Captioner] 19:33:53
 AMBULANCE SERVICE.
THEY'RE NOT MEETING THEIR

[Captioner] 19:33:56
 REQUIREMENTS.
THERE'S ON TWITTER STORIES

[Captioner] 19:33:59
 OF PEOPLE WHO
ARE HAVING A MEDICAL PLJ TWO

[Captioner] 19:34:03
 EMERGENCY
TWO BLOCKS FROM WASHINGTON

[Captioner] 19:34:06
 HOSPITAL AND
IT TAKES A HALF AN HOUR OR AN

[Captioner] 19:34:10
 HOUR FOR
AN AMBULANCE TO SHOW UP TO TRANSPORT
THEM TWO BLOCKS.


[Captioner] 19:34:13
AND THIS IS NOT THE ONLY EVENT.
THIS

[Captioner] 19:34:16
 HAPPENS SO MUCH THAT THEY ARE
FAILING TO MEET

[Captioner] 19:34:19
 THEIR STATISTICAL
REQUIREMENTS FOR

[Captioner] 19:34:24
 SERVICE THAT ARE IN THE
CONTRACT.
THIS WOULDN'T BE SO MUCH OF A

[Captioner] 19:34:27
 PROBLEM IF
ALL THE CITIES WERE

[Captioner] 19:34:30
 AS -- HAD THEIR
HEADS BURIED AS FAR DOWN IN THE SAND AS


[Captioner] 19:34:33
FREMONT DOES.
BUT OTHER

[Captioner] 19:34:37
 CITIES, PLEASANTON, THE CITY
OF LIVERMORE, THEIR CITY COUNCILS HEARD


[Captioner] 19:34:40
ABOUT THIS PROBLEM, AND THEY DIRECTED

[Captioner] 19:34:44

THEIR CITY MANAGER -- THEIR CITY
MANAGERS TO

[Captioner] 19:34:47
 GO AND PROMOTE THEIR
POSITIONS.
FOR

[Captioner] 19:34:50
 EXAMPLE, LIVERMORE, PLEASANTON, THEY
WANT TO HAVE DEDICATED

[Captioner] 19:34:53
 AMBULANCES
STATIONED OUT THERE.
HAYWARD,

[Captioner] 19:34:57
 THEIR UNION, THE FIREFIGHTER
UNION WANTS THE SAME THING FOR

[Captioner] 19:35:00
 HAYWARD.


[Captioner] 19:35:03
SO THERE'S A LOT OF STUFF, IT'S VERY
COMPLICATED ISSUES HERE,

[Captioner] 19:35:06
 AND THE CITY OF
FREMONT'S STAFF AND CITY

[Captioner] 19:35:10
 COUNCIL HAS
JUST BEEN, YOU KNOW

[Captioner] 19:35:13
, OVERLOOKING ALL
THIS STUFF, ALL THESE AMBULANCES DON'T


[Captioner] 19:35:16
SHOW UP, THE STORIES ARE OUT THERE ON
TWITTER ALL THE TIME ABOUT

[Captioner] 19:35:20
 FAILURES OF
AMBULANCE SERVICES, ESPECIALLY DOWN HERE


[Captioner] 19:35:23
IN FREMONT IT'S BEEN HAPPENING QUITE A
BIT WHERE A LOT

[Captioner] 19:35:26
 OF TIMES YOU'LL HEAR
THAT THE STORY IS THAT THE AMBULANCE WAS

[Captioner] 19:35:29

PARKED IN LIVERMORE.
THEN THEY

[Captioner] 19:35:32
 HAVE TO SHIP IT OUT.
SO THIS NEEDS MORE

[Captioner] 19:35:36
 ATTENTION, AND YOU
KNOW, IT CAN'T BE JUST SWEPT UNDER

[Captioner] 19:35:38
 THE
RUG, AND OTHER CITIES ARE PAYING
ATTENTION.


[Captioner] 19:35:42
THANKS.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:35:49
ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS?
I'D LIKE TO MAKE A COMMENT.
I

[Captioner] 19:35:52
 KNOW -- COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL, DO YOU
HAVE A COMMENT ON THIS?


[Captioner] 19:35:55
WERE YOU JUST GOING TO MAKE THE MOTION?
OKAY.


[Captioner] 19:35:58
GO AHEAD IF YOU'D LIKE TO MAKE THE
MOTION AND

[Captioner] 19:35:59
 SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER
SALWAN.
>> Councilmember Campbell: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:36:06
>> Mayor Mei: COULD YOU PLEASE CALL A
VOTE

[Captioner] 19:36:08
?


[Captioner] 19:36:11
>> Councilmember Campbell: I'M SORRY,
MAYOR MEI, DID YOU SAY YOU HAD SOMETHING


[Captioner] 19:36:14
TO SAY BEFORE THE VOTE WAS CALLED?
>> Mayor Mei: IT'S OKAY, I CAN MAKE IT

[Captioner] 19:36:16

AFTERWARDS.
>> Councilmember Campbell: NO, YOU


[Captioner] 19:36:19
CAN'T MAKE IT AFTER WE VOTE.
>> Mayor Mei: WELL, I'M FINE WITH

[Captioner] 19:36:21
 WHAT
IT IS.
I KNOW WE HAVE STAFF IN THE AUDIENCE 

[Captioner] 19:36:24
AND
THAT I'M SUPPORTIVE OF THIS NEED.
>> Councilmember Campbell: OKAY.


[Captioner] 19:36:26
>> Mayor Mei: I'M WELL AWARE OF THE
NEED.
>> Councilmember Campbell: YES.


[Captioner] 19:36:28
WE ALL ARE.
>> Mayor Mei: YES.
>> Councilmember Campbell: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:36:33
>> Councilmember Salwan: PART OF ME --
JUST FOR THE RECORD, I DON'T KNOW IF WE

[Captioner] 19:36:35

CAN CLARIFY THE CITY'S POSITION, IS THAT


[Captioner] 19:36:36
POSSIBLE?
>> Mayor Mei: SURE.
>> Councilmember Salwan: OKAY.


[Captioner] 19:36:41
>> Mayor Mei: DO YOU WANT THE CITY

[Captioner] 19:36:43
 TO
COME AND CLARIFY THE POSITION?
>> Councilmember Salwan: YES.


[Captioner] 19:36:46
>> Mayor Mei: DO WE HAVE A SPEAKER FOR
THAT?
>> City Mgr. Shackelford: I

[Captioner] 19:36:51
 THINK OUR
FIRE CHIEF IS HERE.
>> Mayor Mei: BECAUSE I DEFINITELY

[Captioner] 19:36:54
 AM
AWARE OF THIS NEED.
>> City Mgr. Shackelford: YES, WE

[Captioner] 19:36:57
 ALL
ARE AND WE HAVE BEEN WORKING VERY
CLOSELY WITH THE COUNTY AND WITH

[Captioner] 19:37:00
 OTHER
CITY MANAGERS IN ALAMEDA COUNTY, AS WELL


[Captioner] 19:37:03
AS THE FIRE CHIEFS IN ALAMEDA COUNTY TO
TRY AND GET THE ISSUE

[Captioner] 19:37:06
 RESOLVED.
SO WHAT YOU'RE SEEING BEFORE YOU THIS
EVENING WITH THIS LETTER

[Captioner] 19:37:10
 OF INTENT IS
EXACTLY

[Captioner] 19:37:13
 THAT.
US TRYING TO TAKE ANOTHER APPROACH

[Captioner] 19:37:16
 TO
HAVING IMPROVED AMBULATORY SERVICES IN


[Captioner] 19:37:19
THE CITY OF FREMONT.
CHIEF?
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU, WELCOME,


[Captioner] 19:37:23
CHIEF.
I KNOW YOU AND I HAVE HAD THESE
CONVERSATIONS WITH OUR

[Captioner] 19:37:26
 FELLOW MAYORS AND
FELLOW CHIEFS SO IF YOU CAN MAKE A

[Captioner] 19:37:28

COMMENT ON THIS.
>> JUST AS THE CITY MANAGER SAID, 

[Captioner] 19:37:31
MAYOR
AND COUNCIL, GOOD EVENING, THIS IS
SIMPLY TO START HAVING

[Captioner] 19:37:35
 DISCUSSIONS WITH
THE ALAMEDA COUNTY FIRE DEPARTMENT WHO

[Captioner] 19:37:38

IS POTENTIALLY LOOKING INTO THE OPTION

[Captioner] 19:37:40

OF BIDDING IN TO THE AMBULANCE SERVICE


[Captioner] 19:37:42
SO WE CAN PROVIDE BETTER SERVICE TO OUR
CITIZENS.


[Captioner] 19:37:45
THIS WOULD BE A JOINT EFFORT WITH

[Captioner] 19:37:48
 ALL OF
THE COUNTY AGENCIES, FIRE AGENCIES

[Captioner] 19:37:52
 THAT
DO NOT CURRENTLY HAVE TRANSPORTATION
SERVICES SO THAT WOULD BE

[Captioner] 19:37:55
 FREMONT,
HAYWARD, LIVERMORE, PLEASANTON, OAKLAND

[Captioner] 19:37:58

AND ALAMEDA COUNTY COLLECTIVELY AND ALL


[Captioner] 19:38:01
THIS RESOLUTION IS DOING IS GIVING US
PERMISSION TO TALK ABOUT THESE

[Captioner] 19:38:04
 ISSUES TO
HOPEFULLY PROVIDE A BETTER SERVICE
OPTION TO THE

[Captioner] 19:38:08
 COMMUNITY.
I'M AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK

[Captioner] 19:38:11
 YOU.
COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL, IS THAT STILL

[Captioner] 19:38:15

FROM BEFORE?
>> Councilmember Campbell:

[Captioner] 19:38:16
 YES, THAT'S
FROM BEFORE.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:38:19
SO WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND.
PLEASE VOTE.


[Captioner] 19:38:27
THE MOTION PASSES UNANIMOUSLY.


[Captioner] 19:38:38
NEXT ON OUR AGENDA THIS EVENING IS

[Captioner] 19:38:42

ITEM 6A, WHICH IS A DISCUSSION ABOUT
CEREMONIAL FLAG

[Captioner] 19:38:45
 DISPLAY.
AND WE HAVE A PRESENTATION THIS EVENING

[Captioner] 19:38:48

BY ASSISTANT CITY MANAGER ALLEN

[Captioner] 19:38:52
 DEMERS
AND MANAGEMENT ANALYST AMANDA

[Captioner] 19:39:00
 GALLO WHO
WILL PROVIDE A PRESENTATION TO US.
WELCOME.


[Captioner] 19:39:16
>> THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR, COUNCIL.
SO AMANDA AND I ARE

[Captioner] 19:39:20
 GOING TO PRESENT THE
RESULTS

[Captioner] 19:39:24
 OF SOME RESEARCH INTO CEREMONIAL
FLAG DISPLAY POLICY.
WE'RE ALSO GOING

[Captioner] 19:39:27
 TO MAKE SOME
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE COUNCIL

[Captioner] 19:39:30

REGARDING PROCESS AND PROCEDURES RELATED


[Captioner] 19:39:34
TO CEREMONIAL FLAG DISPLAYS.


[Captioner] 19:39:39
AS BACKGROUND, THE COUNCIL MAY RECALL
THAT ON

[Captioner] 19:39:44
 DECEMBER 20TH, IN CONJUNCTION
WITH THE APPROVAL OF A

[Captioner] 19:39:48
 DIFFERENT
CEREMONIAL FLAG DISPLAY ITEM, COUNCIL

[Captioner] 19:39:50

DIRECTED STAFF TO CONDUCT RESEARCH AND


[Captioner] 19:39:53
TO PRESENT RECOMMENDATIONS RELATED TO
CEREMONIAL

[Captioner] 19:39:56
 FLAG DISPLAY ON JANUARY 10TH,
THE COUNCIL REAFFIRMED

[Captioner] 19:40:00
 THEIR INTEREST IN
STAFF PRESENTING THAT

[Captioner] 19:40:05
 INFORMATION, AND
FOR EVERYONE'S

[Captioner] 19:40:08
 BACKGROUND, THE CITY'S
CURRENT FLAG DISPLAY POLICY RESIDES IN

[Captioner] 19:40:13

AN ADMINISTRATIVE

[Captioner] 19:40:16
 REGULATION, UNDER THE
AUTHORITY OF THE CITY MANAGER.
THAT ADMINISTRATIVE

[Captioner] 19:40:19
 REGULATION IS
1.10 FLAG

[Captioner] 19:40:22
 DISPLAYS, AND THAT POLICY
CURRENTLY DOES NOT

[Captioner] 19:40:26
 ADDRESS CEREMONIAL
FLAG DISPLAY IN ANY WAY, SHAPE OR

[Captioner] 19:40:29
 FORM.
NEXT SLIDE, PLEASE.


[Captioner] 19:40:35
SO THIS EVENING WE ARE GOING TO

[Captioner] 19:40:38
 PRESENT
A LITTLE BIT OF A SUMMARY OF WHAT AMANDA

[Captioner] 19:40:40

FOUND IN LOOKING AT OTHER AGENCIES AND


[Captioner] 19:40:44
HOW THEY CONDUCT THEIR FLAG DISPLAYS,
AND WE'RE

[Captioner] 19:40:47
 GOING TO MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS
REGARD

[Captioner] 19:40:50
ING HOW CEREMONIAL FLAG DISPLAYS
ARE

[Captioner] 19:40:54
 AUTHORIZED AND BY WHOM, AND WE ARE
GOING TO ASK COUNCIL

[Captioner] 19:40:57
 TO CONSIDER KEY
OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES THAT

[Captioner] 19:41:01
 WILL GOVERN
THE CEREMONIAL FLAG DISPLAYS.


[Captioner] 19:41:07
THE FOLLOWING

[Captioner] 19:41:11
 CHART IS A QUICK SUMMARY
OF THE

[Captioner] 19:41:14
 AGENCIES THAT RESPONDED TO OUR
SURVEY.
AS

[Captioner] 19:41:17
 YOU CAN SEE FROM THE CHART, JUST OVER
HALF OF THE

[Captioner] 19:41:21
 SURVEYED AGENCIES HAVE A
POLICY GOVERNING CEREMONIAL

[Captioner] 19:41:24
 FLAG DISPLAYS.
THE VAST

[Captioner] 19:41:28
 MAJORITY OF THOSE

[Captioner] 19:41:31
 AGENCIES
APPROVE THEIR CEREMONIAL FLAG DISPLAYS

[Captioner] 19:41:34

BY COUNCIL ACTION, WHICH IS CONSISTENT

[Captioner] 19:41:37

WITH OUR RECOMMENDATION FOR COUNCIL THIS


[Captioner] 19:41:42
EVENING.
AND ONLY A COUPLE OF THEM ALLOW FOR
COMMUNITY

[Captioner] 19:41:46
 PARTICIPATION, AND WE'LL
DISCUSS THE REASON FOR THAT AS WE MOVE

[Captioner] 19:41:49

FORWARD.


[Captioner] 19:41:54
SO OUR FIRST RECOMMENDATION RELATES

[Captioner] 19:41:59
 TO
THE APPROVAL PROCESS.
STAFF'S RECOMMENDATION

[Captioner] 19:42:03
 TO COUNCIL IS
THAT

[Captioner] 19:42:06
 INDIVIDUAL CEREMONIAL FLAG
OBSERVANCES BE REQUESTED EITHER

[Captioner] 19:42:10
 BY A
CITY COUNCILPERSON OR BY THE CITY

[Captioner] 19:42:13

MANAGER, AND THEY BE APPROVED BY A
MAJORITY COUNCIL ACTION.


[Captioner] 19:42:17
AND THE REASON FOR THAT

[Captioner] 19:42:21
 IS, ONE, IT'S

[Captioner] 19:42:24

CLEAR IN AN UNAMBIGUOUS AUTHORIZATION TO


[Captioner] 19:42:28
STAFF.
STAFF WILL KNOW SPECIFICALLY WHICH
CEREMONIAL FLAG

[Captioner] 19:42:30
 DISPLAYS COUNCIL IS
SEEKING TO RECOGNIZE AND WHICH THEY ARE


[Captioner] 19:42:34
NOT.
IT'S AN AFFIRMATION THAT THE

[Captioner] 19:42:38
 FLAG BEING
DISPLAYED IS A FORM

[Captioner] 19:42:41
 OF COUNCIL SPEECH
AND THAT'S IMPORTANT

[Captioner] 19:42:45
 BECAUSE THE
FLAGPOLES CAN

[Captioner] 19:42:48
 BE CONSIDERED A PUBLIC
FORUM IF THEY

[Captioner] 19:42:52
 ARE NOT SPECIFIED TO

[Captioner] 19:42:55
 BE A
PLACE FOR COUNCIL SPEECH IN PARTICULAR.


[Captioner] 19:42:58
SO OUR RECOMMENDATIONS TONIGHT ASK THE
COUNCIL TO

[Captioner] 19:43:02
 AFFIRM THAT ANY
CEREMONIAL FLAG

[Captioner] 19:43:05
 SELECTION IS A FORM OF
COUNCIL'S OWN SPEECH AS OPPOSED TO

[Captioner] 19:43:08

ENCOURAGING A PUBLIC FORUM THAT

[Captioner] 19:43:12
 MIGHT
END UP PUTTING COUNCIL IN A DIFFICULT
POSITION OF

[Captioner] 19:43:15
 HAVING TO CONSIDER
CEREMONIAL FLAGS THAT ARE

[Captioner] 19:43:19
 NOT CONSISTENT
WITH THE COUNCIL'S VALUES.


[Captioner] 19:43:23
IF WE UTILIZE THIS PROCESS

[Captioner] 19:43:27
, THE CITY
COUNCIL CAN AUTHORIZE

[Captioner] 19:43:31
 ONE-OFF CEREMONIAL
FLAG DISPLAYS OVER THE COURSE OF

[Captioner] 19:43:34
 THE
YEAR.
AND

[Captioner] 19:43:38
 CAN DIRECT STAFF KIND OF AT ANY TIME
AS THE YEAR GOES

[Captioner] 19:43:41
 ALONG.
AN ALTERNATE OPTION WOULD BE FOR

[Captioner] 19:43:44
 THE
CITY COUNCIL TO CONSIDER A SINGLE
CALENDAR

[Captioner] 19:43:48
 OF CEREMONIAL FLAG EVENT

[Captioner] 19:43:52

ALL AT ONE TIME.
THAT'S

[Captioner] 19:43:55
THAT CERTAINLY
ACCOMPLISHES THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVES

[Captioner] 19:43:59
 OF
KEEPING THE FLAGS -- A FORM

[Captioner] 19:44:02
 OF COUNCIL'S
SPEECH BUT IT

[Captioner] 19:44:06
 MAY HAMSTRING COUNCIL AS
THE YEAR GOES ALONG

[Captioner] 19:44:09
 FROM CONSIDERING
OTHER ALTERNATE

[Captioner] 19:44:13
 HOLIDAYS AND THAT COULD
BE CHALLENGING

[Captioner] 19:44:17
.


[Captioner] 19:44:22
OPERATIONALLY, COUNCIL RECOMMENDS THAT
CITY STAFF BE RESPONSIBLE

[Captioner] 19:44:26
 FOR THE
SELECTION, ACQUISITION,

[Captioner] 19:44:29
 STORAGE, RAISING
AND LOWERING OF CEREMONIAL

[Captioner] 19:44:32
  FLAGS.
CITY STAFF WOULD

[Captioner] 19:44:35
 ACQUIRE FLAGS TO ENSURE
THAT EACH SELECTED FLAG IS OF THE

[Captioner] 19:44:39
 SAME
SIZE AND QUALITY.
CITY STAFF

[Captioner] 19:44:42
 WOULD STORE FLAGS TO ENSURE
THAT THE FLAGS ARE MAINTAINED

[Captioner] 19:44:45
 IN A
RESPECTFUL AND CONSISTENT MANNER WHEN
NOT

[Captioner] 19:44:48
 ON DISPLAY.
CITY STAFF WOULD

[Captioner] 19:44:53
 ALLOCATE TIME TO
ANNOUNCING THE REASON FOR

[Captioner] 19:44:56
 THE CEREMONIAL
DISPLAY, AND

[Captioner] 19:45:00
 WOULD ALLOCATE

[Captioner] 19:45:03
 STAFF TIME
TO PURCHASE THE FLAG, TO RAISE IT, TO
LOWER IT AND

[Captioner] 19:45:06
 TO STORE IT.
AND STAFF WOULD INTEND TO LIMIT

[Captioner] 19:45:09
 ITS
SUPPORT FOR THE CEREMONIAL FLAG DISPLAY


[Captioner] 19:45:12
OPTIONS TO THOSE ACTIVITIES.
IN AN

[Captioner] 19:45:15
 EFFORT TO PRESERVE RESOURCES, TIME
AND ATTENTION FOR COUNCIL'S

[Captioner] 19:45:19
 KEY
PRIORITIES.


[Captioner] 19:45:24
AS RECOMMENDED

[Captioner] 19:45:28
 IN THIS MOST, I THINK,
EFFECTIVE

[Captioner] 19:45:31
 FORMAT FOR CEREMONIAL FLAG
DISPLAYS, EACH

[Captioner] 19:45:35
 FLAG DISPLAY WOULD COST
APPROXIMATELY $700.


[Captioner] 19:45:39
IF WE ENHANCE ANY ASPECT OF THE
CEREMONIAL

[Captioner] 19:45:43
 FLAG DISPLAYS

[Captioner] 19:45:46
, IF WE WERE TO
GENERATE ADDITIONAL EVENTS

[Captioner] 19:45:49
 SURROUNDING
THE DISPLAYS, THAT PRICETAG WILL GO UP


[Captioner] 19:45:54
CERTAINLY.
BUT AS PROPOSED

[Captioner] 19:45:57
, $700 IS A REASONABLE
ESTIMATE

[Captioner] 19:46:00
 FOR EACH CEREMONIAL DISPLAY
THAT COUNCIL WERE TO APPROVE.


[Captioner] 19:46:08
SO IN SUMMARY, THE RECOMMENDATIONS
BEFORE

[Captioner] 19:46:11
 COUNCIL TONIGHT ARE,

[Captioner] 19:46:15
 ONE, TO
RECEIVE OUR

[Captioner] 19:46:18
 PRESENTATION AND REPORT, AND

[Captioner] 19:46:22

TO DIRECT STAFF, IF YOU SO CHOOSE, TO,

[Captioner] 19:46:25

ONE, PUT INTO POLICY THAT INDIVIDUAL
CEREMONIAL

[Captioner] 19:46:29
 FLAG OBSERVANCES MUST BE
REQUESTED BY A

[Captioner] 19:46:32
 COUNCILMEMBER AND CITY
MANAGER AND APPROVED BY A

[Captioner] 19:46:35
 MAJORITY
COUNCIL ACTION, AND TWO, TO DICTATE

[Captioner] 19:46:38
 THE
CITY STAFF SHALL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE


[Captioner] 19:46:41
SELECTION, ACQUISITION, STORAGE, RAISING
AND LOWERING OF

[Captioner] 19:46:45
 CEREMONIAL FLAGS AND
ONLY THOSE ACTIVITIES.


[Captioner] 19:46:50
AND WITH THAT, WE'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER
ANY QUESTIONS THAT

[Captioner] 19:46:53
 COUNCIL HAS AND
RECEIVE ANY DIRECTION.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:46:57
COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL.
>> Councilmember Campbell:

[Captioner] 19:47:01
 YES, THANKS
FOR ANSWERING SOME OF MY QUESTIONS

[Captioner] 19:47:05

EARLIER TODAY.
BUT JUST AS YOU WERE TALKING, AND I

[Captioner] 19:47:08
 DID
HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO ACTUALLY REVIEW

[Captioner] 19:47:11

THE ADMINISTRATIVE REG, AND SO I

[Captioner] 19:47:14
 KNOW
THIS WAS BEFORE

[Captioner] 19:47:18
 US BUT IT'S NOT MORE
PROCESS BUT I DO

[Captioner] 19:47:21
 HAVE A PROCESS
QUESTION, I'M SORRY.
SO IF WE DECIDE TO GO

[Captioner] 19:47:25
 WITH YOUR
RECOMMENDATION, AND

[Captioner] 19:47:28
 WE BROUGHT A
REFERRAL, WOULD THAT FLAG -- BECAUSE
BASED ON WHAT

[Captioner] 19:47:31
 I READ IN THE REGULATIONS,
THERE'S AN AMOUNT OF TIME IN

[Captioner] 19:47:35
 WHICH THE
FLAG IS NEEDING TO

[Captioner] 19:47:39
 BE ON A RAISED
STANDARD, SO WOULD THAT

[Captioner] 19:47:42
 BE LIKE THE
WHOLE MONTH, SO IF WE SAY WE WANTED TO

[Captioner] 19:47:45

DO BLACK HISTORY MONTH, FOR EXAMPLE,
WOULD THAT

[Captioner] 19:47:48
 FLAG BE RAISED FOR THE WHOLE
M

[Captioner] 19:47:51
 MONTH?
>> STAFF WOULD CERTAINLY BE RESPONSIBLE


[Captioner] 19:47:54
TO COUNCIL DIRECTION ON THE CEREMONIAL
FLAGS.
I THINK

[Captioner] 19:47:57
 THAT -- AND AMANDA, FEEL FREE TO
WEIGH IN, BUT AS WE LOOKED AT WHAT

[Captioner] 19:48:01
 OTHER
CITIES DID,

[Captioner] 19:48:04
 LARGELY CEREMONIAL FLAGS
WERE DISPLAYED FOR A MONTH.


[Captioner] 19:48:07
THERE ARE INSTANCES WHERE THE

[Captioner] 19:48:10
 FLAG WAS
DISPLAYED FOR TWO

[Captioner] 19:48:13
 WEEKS FOR A PARTICULAR
KIND OF EVENT, BUT

[Captioner] 19:48:16
 LARGELY IT WOULD BE
FOR 30 DAYS, WOULD BE THE INTENT.
>> Councilmember Campbell: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:48:20
AND THEN MY FOLLOW-ON QUESTION TO THAT,
AGAIN,

[Captioner] 19:48:23
 I'M SORRY I JUST READ THE REGS,

[Captioner] 19:48:26

SO -- WE HAVE FLAGPOLES IN SEVERAL
DIFFERENT

[Captioner] 19:48:29
 PLACES THROUGHOUT THE CITY.
THE FIRE DEPARTMENT,

[Captioner] 19:48:32
 CITY HALL, SOME
OTHER BUILDINGS

[Captioner] 19:48:38
 AROUND -- THAT THE CITY
SUPPORTS.


[Captioner] 19:48:41
WOULD THIS FLAG RAISING CEREMONY ONLY BE

[Captioner] 19:48:45

AT CITY HALL, OR ARE THERE OTHER
LOCATIONS THAT WE

[Captioner] 19:48:47
 WOULD BE CONSIDERING,
GIVEN THAT WE HAVE THEM ALL OVER THE
CITY?


[Captioner] 19:48:53
>> I'VE GOT AN ANSWER AND

[Captioner] 19:48:56
 A MINOR
QUIBBLE WITH YOUR PHRASEOLOGY.


[Captioner] 19:49:00
FIRST WOULD BE, YES, WE

[Captioner] 19:49:03
 WOULD INTEND TO
LIMIT THE CEREMONIAL FLAG DISPLAYS TO
OCCUR AT

[Captioner] 19:49:06
 CITY HALL ONLY, AND WE WOULD
CONSIDER THEM TO BE CEREMONIAL

[Captioner] 19:49:10
 FLAG
DISPLAYS AS OPPOSED TO 
CEREMONIES.


[Captioner] 19:49:14
CEREMONIES ARE INHERENTLY MORE PROCESS
AND

[Captioner] 19:49:18
 STAFF-DRIVEN EVENTS THAT WE WOULD BE
STEERING AWAY FROM IN THIS

[Captioner] 19:49:20
 SET OF
RECOMMENDATIONS.
>> Councilmember Campbell: OKAY.


[Captioner] 19:49:24
I'M SORRY, ONE LAST QUESTION, I
PROMISE.


[Captioner] 19:49:29
THE REGULATION CALLS FOR THIS

[Captioner] 19:49:32
 SORT OF
PROCESS OF DELIBERATELY

[Captioner] 19:49:36
 RAISING THE FLAG
IN A CERTAIN WAY, STAFFED UP AND

[Captioner] 19:49:39
 THEN
SLOWLY RAISING IT DOWN.
IS THAT WHAT

[Captioner] 19:49:42
 YOU'RE ENVISIONING?
BECAUSE THAT WAS DIFFERENT THAN WHAT WE


[Captioner] 19:49:46
SAW HERE.
IT WAS JUST DISPLAYED.
SO ARE WE --

[Captioner] 19:49:50
 WITH THE BLACK HISTORY
FLAG, I

[Captioner] 19:49:53
 KNOW THAT THERE WAS EXTENUATING
CIRCUMSTANCES BY WHICH

[Captioner] 19:49:56
 THIS ONE IS
SITTING HERE THE WAY THAT IT IS, BUT
THAT WOULD BE

[Captioner] 19:50:00
 THE PROCESS, ARE WE GOING
TO LITERALLY BE

[Captioner] 19:50:03
 OUTSIDE, DOING THE --
FOLLOWING THE REGULATIONS IN TERMS

[Captioner] 19:50:07
 OF
HOW AND WHO THE

[Captioner] 19:50:10
 CHIEF FIRE

[Captioner] 19:50:12
 BATON PERSON
IS SUPPOSED TO BE LIFTING AND LOWERING


[Captioner] 19:50:16
IT, THAT KIND OF STUFF, WHO'S GOING TO
BE IN CHARGE OF IT?
I'M JUST TRYING

[Captioner] 19:50:19
 TO SEE HOW THIS PROCESS
FITS INTO THE

[Captioner] 19:50:22
 REGULATION SO FAR.
>> YES, STAFF'S INTENT WOULD

[Captioner] 19:50:26
 BE THAT
THESE FLAGS WOULD BE RAISED

[Captioner] 19:50:29
 OUTSIDE ON
THE CONVENTIONAL FLAGPOLE

[Captioner] 19:50:33
 IN FRONT OF
CITY HALL, AND THAT THEY

[Captioner] 19:50:36
 WOULD BE RAISED
IN THE SAME MANNER THAT THE

[Captioner] 19:50:39
 U.S. FLAG
AND THE CALIFORNIA FLAG ARE RAISED

[Captioner] 19:50:43
 AND
DISPLAYED ON THOSE FLAGPOLES.
>> Councilmember

[Captioner] 19:50:46
 Campbell: BUT THAT
SEEMS VERY

[Captioner] 19:50:49
 CEREMONIAL, AND THAT --

[Captioner] 19:50:52
 WELL,
NEVER MIND, I THINK I HEARD WHAT YOU
SAID.


[Captioner] 19:50:56
SO I THINK I GOT MY QUESTION ANSWERED.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.


[Captioner] 19:51:00
>> City Mgr. Shackelford: JUST TO KIND
OF CLARIFY THE CEREMONIAL

[Captioner] 19:51:04
 ASPECT, I
THINK THAT ALAN WAS THINKING

[Captioner] 19:51:07
 ABOUT, WHEN
WE DISCUSS IT

[Captioner] 19:51:10
 NOT BEING THE INTENT FOR
TO NOT

[Captioner] 19:51:13
 BE CEREMONIAL, WE MEAN AS FAR AS
ANY EVENT

[Captioner] 19:51:16
 WITH SPEAKERS AND MUSIC

[Captioner] 19:51:20
 AND
FOOD AND DRINK AND ALL OF THAT, IT WOULD

[Captioner] 19:51:22

BE CEREMONIAL JUST AS YOU DESCRIBED AS


[Captioner] 19:51:26
FAR AS THE RAISING OF THE FLAGS AND THEN
THE

[Captioner] 19:51:29
 LOWERING OF THE FLAGS.


[Captioner] 19:51:33
>> Councilmember Campbell: THANK YOU
FOR THAT CLARIFICATION.


[Captioner] 19:51:37
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN.


[Captioner] 19:51:41
>> Councilmember Kassan: THANK YOU.
SO I WAS DOING A LITTLE RESEARCH

[Captioner] 19:51:45
 ON
THIS, AND I NOTICED THERE WAS A SUPREME

[Captioner] 19:51:48

COURT CASE FROM I THINK 2021,

[Captioner] 19:51:51
 THE

[Captioner] 19:51:56

SCHIRTLIFF CASE.
IN THAT CASE, THE FLAGPOLES WERE

[Captioner] 19:51:59
 ALLOWED
TO BE -- COMMUNITY MEMBERS WERE ALLOWED


[Captioner] 19:52:02
TO PROPOSE FLAGS, AND IT SOUNDS LIKE
WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS THAT'S

[Captioner] 19:52:04
 NOT WHAT --
THAT WOULDN'T BE THE BEST IDEA BECAUSE


[Captioner] 19:52:08
AS SOON AS YOU LET THE COMMUNITY START

[Captioner] 19:52:10

TO PROPOSE DIFFERENT IDEAS, THEN YOU ARE


[Captioner] 19:52:13
DEALING WITH THE POTENTIAL OF NOT BEING
ABLE TO SAY NO

[Captioner] 19:52:17
 TO ANYONE BECAUSE THAT
COULD BE SEEN AS DISCRIMINATION

[Captioner] 19:52:20
 BASED ON
VIEWPOINT.
WHEREAS

[Captioner] 19:52:23
 IF THIS IS GOVERNMENT SPEECH,

[Captioner] 19:52:25

BECAUSE WE CONTROL WHAT HAPPENS, THEN WE


[Captioner] 19:52:29
DO HAVE THE ABILITY TO SAY YES OR NO

[Captioner] 19:52:32
 TO
DIFFERENT FLAGS BEING RAISED.
IS

[Captioner] 19:52:35
 THAT RIGHT?


[Captioner] 19:52:41
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: ESSENTIALLY
WITH THE ONE ADDITIONAL OBSERVATION THAT


[Captioner] 19:52:45
THE ONLY MEMBERS AND INDIVIDUALS THAT
ARE REQUESTING IT ARE EITHER

[Captioner] 19:52:48
 INDIVIDUAL
COUNCILMEMBERS OR CITY STAFF, WHICH
COMPLETELY REMOVES IT FROM

[Captioner] 19:52:52
 WHAT OCCURRED
IN THE SHIRLIFF CASE WHICH WAS

[Captioner] 19:52:55
 DECIDED
LAST MAY.


[Captioner] 19:52:59
>> Councilmember Kassan: I KNOW BOSTON
HAD A MUCH MORE

[Captioner] 19:53:03
 OPEN PROCESS WHERE
ANYONE COULD REQUEST RAISING A FLAG.


[Captioner] 19:53:06
SO I DEFINITELY AGREE THAT WE DON'T WANT
TO OPEN OURSELVES UP

[Captioner] 19:53:09
 TO POTENTIAL FIRST
AMENDMENT LAWSUITS BY

[Captioner] 19:53:12
 OPENING UP THE
PROCESS TO A

[Captioner] 19:53:15
 BROADER COMMUNITY.
AS MUCH AS THAT WOULD BE LOVELY, IT'S

[Captioner] 19:53:18

JUST NOT REALISTIC AND A BIT RISKY FOR


[Captioner] 19:53:21
US, SO I DEFINITELY AGREE WITH THAT
RECOMMENDATION.
AND I'M JUST

[Captioner] 19:53:25
 WONDERING

[Captioner] 19:53:28
, WE STILL COULD
GET INTO A SITUATION WHERE THERE'S A LOT


[Captioner] 19:53:31
OF DIFFERENT PROPOSALS FOR FLAG
RAISINGS.
I MEAN,

[Captioner] 19:53:35
 WE'VE ALREADY HAD A PROPOSAL FOR
21 DIFFERENT ONES.


[Captioner] 19:53:38
SO I'M WONDERING IF IT WOULDN'T MAKE
SOME

[Captioner] 19:53:41
 SENSE TO HAVE SOME GENERAL POLICIES
AROUND HOW

[Captioner] 19:53:44
 WE DECIDE WHETHER TO SAY YES
OR NO TO A FLAG RAISING.
LIKE

[Captioner] 19:53:47
 JUST AS ONE EXAMPLE, AND I KNOW
WE'RE PROBABLY NOT GOING TO

[Captioner] 19:53:50
 DECIDE THIS
TODAY, BUT IF WE COULD

[Captioner] 19:53:53
 HAVE SOME
LIMITATIONS THAT WOULD MAKE IT A LITTLE


[Captioner] 19:53:56
BIT EASIER TO SAY YES OR NO TO
PARTICULAR

[Captioner] 19:53:59
 PROPOSED FLAG RAISINGS, AND
AS AN EXAMPLE,

[Captioner] 19:54:02
 THERE ARE CERTAIN

[Captioner] 19:54:06

CELEBRATIONS AND MONTHS AND DAYS THAT
HONESTLY -- AND

[Captioner] 19:54:09
 I'VE BEEN LOOKING INTO
THIS -- THERE REALLY IS

[Captioner] 19:54:12
 NO FLAG
ASSOCIATED WITH THEM.


[Captioner] 19:54:15
AND SO AS AN EXAMPLE, WE COULD SAY WE

[Captioner] 19:54:18

WILL NOT CONSIDER A FLAG RAISING

[Captioner] 19:54:22

PROPOSAL BY A COUNCILMEMBER IF THERE
REALLY

[Captioner] 19:54:25
 IS NO FLAG EASILY IDENTIFIABLE,
OR AT ALL

[Captioner] 19:54:28
 IDENTIFIABLE THAT WE COULD
RAISE.
JUST AS AN EXAMPLE.


[Captioner] 19:54:31
I JUST THINK IT MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA TO
ADOPT SOME

[Captioner] 19:54:35
 GENERAL POLICIES, BECAUSE
OTHERWISE WE COULD GET INTO A SITUATION

[Captioner] 19:54:38

WHERE HOPEFULLY THIS WOULDN'T HAPPEN,
BUT WE COULD GET INTO A SITUATION 

[Captioner] 19:54:42
WHERE
THERE'S A LOT OF PROPOSALS FOR FLAG
RAISINGS AND WE COULD SPEND A LOT

[Captioner] 19:54:45
 OF
TIME GOING AROUND AND AROUND ON EACH

[Captioner] 19:54:48

PROPOSAL, SO I JUST WONDER IF THERE
WOULD BE

[Captioner] 19:54:52
 OPENNESS TO HAVING SOME BASIC
GUIDELINES OF, YOU KNOW,

[Captioner] 19:54:54
 DON'T BOTHER
BRINGING A FLAG RAISING PROPOSAL UNLESS


[Captioner] 19:54:58
IT MEETS THESE -- THIS SMALL LIST OF
REQUIREMENTS.


[Captioner] 19:55:06
>> Mayor Mei: COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN.
>> Councilmember Salwan: THANK

[Captioner] 19:55:10
 YOU,
MADAME MAYOR.
THANK YOU

[Captioner] 19:55:13
 FOR DOING THE COMPREHENSIVE
RESEARCH ON THIS.
I APPRECIATE

[Captioner] 19:55:16
 IT.
SO I

[Captioner] 19:55:20
 GUESS THREE KEY QUESTIONS.  ONE IS
WHETHER THE CITY CONDUCT IT

[Captioner] 19:55:24
 OR ALLOW THE
PUBLIC, SO I LIKE THE IDEA OF THE CITY


[Captioner] 19:55:27
CONDUCTING IT, AND IT BEING COUNCIL
SPEECH.


[Captioner] 19:55:31
OPERATIONALLY, I THINK THAT'S A GREAT
IDEA.
I THINK WE SHOULD DO

[Captioner] 19:55:34
 IT PROFESSIONALLY
AND CONSISTENTLY.


[Captioner] 19:55:37
THE ONLY ONE I KIND OF HAVE AN ALTERNATE
SUGGESTION

[Captioner] 19:55:40
 WHICH IS, I'M CONCERNED THAT
IF WE DO A ONE-TIME

[Captioner] 19:55:44
 REFERRAL, THEN IT'S
GOING TO BECOME VERY POLITICAL, AND SO

[Captioner] 19:55:47
 I
DON'T WANT, EVERY MONTH, A
COUNCILMEMBER,

[Captioner] 19:55:49
 BECAUSE -- YOU KNOW, TO
BE THE FIRST ONE WHO WANTS TO DO A FLAG


[Captioner] 19:55:51
RAISING OF SUCH AND SUCH OR A DIFFERENT
OCCASION.


[Captioner] 19:55:55
I PERSONALLY LIKE THE IDEA OF MORE OF,
YOU

[Captioner] 19:55:58
 KNOW, SET A CALENDAR, PERHAPS AT THE
ANNUAL RETREAT,

[Captioner] 19:56:01
 WE PICK -- WE CAN'T DO
20, BUT MAYBE WE DO, YOU

[Captioner] 19:56:05
 KNOW, THREE OR
FIVE OR 10 OR -- YOU KNOW, WE FIGURE OUT


[Captioner] 19:56:08
THE NUMBER THAT CAN WORK FOR THE CITY AS
WELL AS THE

[Captioner] 19:56:11
 COUNCIL, AND WE JUST AGREE
TO IT AT THAT TIME SO

[Captioner] 19:56:14
 THAT THE WHOLE
YEAR, THE

[Captioner] 19:56:17
 AGENDA IS SET, SO THAT WAY
WE'RE NOT HAVING MORE AND MORE

[Captioner] 19:56:21

REFERRALS.
AND I THINK THAT

[Captioner] 19:56:24
 WOULD -- CERTAINLY NOT
THE DIRECTION

[Captioner] 19:56:27
 I WANT TO SEE, I'D LIKE TO
MAKE IT AN APOLITICAL PROCESS, SO

[Captioner] 19:56:29
 IF WE
CAN AGREE ON A FEW KEY DAYS, PERHAPS AT


[Captioner] 19:56:33
THE RETREAT OR SOMEWHERE WHERE WE HAVE
MORE TIME, THEN IT WITH

[Captioner] 19:56:36
 CAN BE PART OF
OUR PLAN.
SO THAT'S MY FEEDBACK.


[Captioner] 19:56:40
THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL.


[Captioner] 19:56:45
>> Councilmember Campbell: SORRY.
YOU KNOW WHAT, I KIND OF LIKE THAT

[Captioner] 19:56:49
 IDEA,
COUNCILMEMBER, BECAUSE YOU COULD HAVE --


[Captioner] 19:56:52
JUST SAY YOU HAVE 20 ON THE LIST THAT
YOU LIKE.
YOU

[Captioner] 19:56:55
 COULD ROTATE THEM AROUND SO THAT YOU
DO -- YOU HIT

[Captioner] 19:56:58
 ALL WITHIN A COUPLE, FEW
YEARS.
SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO

[Captioner] 19:57:01
 DO THE SAME ONE
EVERY YEAR AT THE SAME TIME.


[Captioner] 19:57:05
THAT GIVES YOU A WID

[Captioner] 19:57:08
ER -- CASTS A WIDER
NET FOR LACK OF A BETTER

[Captioner] 19:57:11
 TERM TO BE ABLE
TO RECOGNIZE A HOST

[Captioner] 19:57:15
 OF OTHER -- TO BE
MORE INCLUSIVE.


[Captioner] 19:57:20
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
COUNCILMEMBER KENG.


[Captioner] 19:57:23
>> Vice Mayor Keng: THANK YOU, MADAME
MAYOR.
SO I

[Captioner] 19:57:27
 DO LIKE THE PROPOSAL BY
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN

[Captioner] 19:57:30
 EARLIER.
I THINK IT IS -- IT WILL BE EASIER FOR

[Captioner] 19:57:34

US TO HAVE THAT -- SET

[Captioner] 19:57:37
 A CALENDAR
INSTEAD OF ONE HERE, ONE THERE, AND

[Captioner] 19:57:40
 THEN
ESPECIALLY I THINK IF WE'RE TRYING TO
HAVE A

[Captioner] 19:57:43
 FLAG UP FOR 30 DAYS AT A TIME,
AND

[Captioner] 19:57:46
 YOU KNOW, CONSIDERING ALL THE
EXPENSES AND

[Captioner] 19:57:49
 STAFF TIME THAT WOULD BE
INVOLVED, I THINK IT WILL BE

[Captioner] 19:57:52
 GOOD TO
HAVE THAT CALENDAR DECIDED, PERHAPS

[Captioner] 19:57:55

DOING COUNCIL RETREAT, WHEN WE CAN HAVE


[Captioner] 19:57:58
SOME MORE TIME TO GO OVER IT.
THANK

[Captioner] 19:58:01
 YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:58:06
COUNCILMEMBER COX?


[Captioner] 19:58:09
>> Councilmember Cox: THANK YOU.
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE WORK THAT

[Captioner] 19:58:12

YOU'VE DONE,

[Captioner] 19:58:16
 AND FIND OF WHAT'S
HAPPENING, WHAT OTHER CITIES

[Captioner] 19:58:19
 ARE DOING.
I HAD A QUESTION IN TERMS OF DID THE
RESEARCH

[Captioner] 19:58:23
 YOU DID, IT WASN'T CLEAR IN
TERMS OF IF YOU

[Captioner] 19:58:26
 HAVE MORE THAN TWO OR
THREE OR

[Captioner] 19:58:32
 FIVE, WHAT WAS THE PRECEDENT
SET TO

[Captioner] 19:58:35
 SHOW WHICH FLAG WOULD BE UP
LONGER THAN THE OTHER?
DID THEY EVER PROVIDE

[Captioner] 19:58:38
 ANY -- WHEN DID
YOU YOUR RESEARCH WITH THE OTHER CITIES,


[Captioner] 19:58:41
DID THEY EVER PROVIDE ANY INFORMATION?
HOW DID THEY DECIDE ON THAT?


[Captioner] 19:58:46
>> THE VAST MAJORITY OF CITIES THAT WE
SURVEYED

[Captioner] 19:58:49
 ONLY CONDUCTED TWO CEREMONIAL

[Captioner] 19:58:52

FLAG DISPLAYS PER YEAR.
THERE

[Captioner] 19:58:56
 WERE ONE OR TWO CITYS THAT DID
PUBLISH A CALENDAR IN THE MANNER THAT

[Captioner] 19:58:59

YOU'RE DESCRIBING.


[Captioner] 19:59:03
BUT MOST CITIES

[Captioner] 19:59:06
 ONLY RECOGNIZED TWO.
SO IT DIDN'T COME

[Captioner] 19:59:09
 UP.


[Captioner] 19:59:13
>> Councilmember Cox: DO YOU RECALL
WHICH TWO THEY DID?
>> I BELIEVE IT WAS BLACK

[Captioner] 19:59:16
 HISTORY MONTH
AND LGBTQ

[Captioner] 19:59:19
 AWARENESS MONTH.


[Captioner] 19:59:29
JUST CURIOUS TO FIND OUT IN TERMS OF --
WE'VE BEEN AROUND TO A LOT OF

[Captioner] 19:59:33
 DIFFERENT
CITIES AND SOME DO A FORMAL CEREMONY
INSIDE AND

[Captioner] 19:59:36
 THEY JUST DO IT WITH THE FLAG
POST THAT WE

[Captioner] 19:59:39
 HAVE.


[Captioner] 19:59:43
AND SOME OF THE CITY COUNCILMEMBERS OUT
OF THEIR BUDGET WOULD THEN

[Captioner] 19:59:47
 SPONSOR LIKE
A RECEPTION, AND SO THOSE ARE KIND OF
THINGS THAT

[Captioner] 19:59:50
 I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND

[Captioner] 19:59:53

THAT THERE WASN'T REALLY -- IT WAS
SILENT ON GUIDANCE FOR THOSE

[Captioner] 19:59:56
 TYPE OF
THINGS.
IT WAS JUST MORE FLAG

[Captioner] 19:59:59
 DISPLAY ONLY, AND
NOTHING ELSE ATTACHED TO IT, BUT

[Captioner] 20:00:03
 HOW
WOULD WE ADDRESS AS THE CITY IF

[Captioner] 20:00:06
 SOME
GROUPS WANTED TO COMBINE A FLAG

[Captioner] 20:00:10
 CEREMONY
AND THEN HAVE A RECEPTION

[Captioner] 20:00:14
 AFTER THAT.
SO JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND IF THERE
WAS ANY

[Captioner] 20:00:17
 THOUGHT OR THINGS LIKE THAT TO
CONSIDER.


[Captioner] 20:00:21
>> City Mgr. Shackelford: BASED ON THE
NUMBER OF DISCUSSIONS WE'VE

[Captioner] 20:00:24
 HAD ABOUT
CEREMONIAL ITEMS AND FLAG

[Captioner] 20:00:28
 RAISINGS HERE
AT THE CITY COUNCIL

[Captioner] 20:00:32
 MEETINGS, AND IN
RESPONSE TO

[Captioner] 20:00:35
 THE TWO REFERRALS RELATED TO
FLAG RAISING, WE TOOK

[Captioner] 20:00:38
 THE REFERRAL IN
THE MOST LITERAL SENSE, AND TRIED TO

[Captioner] 20:00:42

RESPOND TO IT BASED ON OUR

[Captioner] 20:00:46
 EXISTING
RESOURCES IN ORDER TO PROVIDE THE

[Captioner] 20:00:48

COUNCIL WITH SOMETHING MOST
IMMEDIATELY.


[Captioner] 20:00:52
WE HAVE HAD SOME DISCUSSIONS

[Captioner] 20:00:55
 HERE ABOUT
THEM

[Captioner] 20:00:58
 BEING MORE EVENT-ORIENTED LIKE
MAYBE SOME OTHER CITIES

[Captioner] 20:01:01
 LIKE OAKLAND OR
BERKELEY OR CITIES LIKE THAT, BUT AGAIN,

[Captioner] 20:01:05


[Captioner] 20:01:08
 WE TAKE THE REFERRAL IN THE
MOST LITERAL SENSE AND TRY TO ADDRESS IT

[Captioner] 20:01:12

BASED ON OUR MOST CURRENT RESOURCE.

[Captioner] 20:01:15
 RESOURCES.
QUITE HONESTLY, WE'RE NOT RESOURCED TO

[Captioner] 20:01:18

HAVE CEREMONIAL EVENTS, ESPECIALLY IF
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ADDING

[Captioner] 20:01:21
 ANOTHER 19 OR
20 EVENTS.
SO THAT WOULD BE

[Captioner] 20:01:25
 A WHOLE 'NOTHER

[Captioner] 20:01:27

BUDGETARY PROCESS, YOU KNOW, TO LOOK AT


[Captioner] 20:01:30
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.


[Captioner] 20:01:34
>> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.
LET ME ASK YOU THIS SO IT'S KIND

[Captioner] 20:01:37
 OF
CLEAR WHEN WE SAY "CEREMONIAL FLAG

[Captioner] 20:01:39

RAISING."
I THINK IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN SAID A 

[Captioner] 20:01:41
LITTLE
EARLIER BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE I HEAR


[Captioner] 20:01:44
IT CORRECTLY.


[Captioner] 20:01:48
CEREMONY IN THE PARKING LOT DURING THE
FLAG

[Captioner] 20:01:51
 RAISING VERSUS CEREMONIAL
DISPLAYING THE FLAG

[Captioner] 20:01:54
 IN OUR CITY
CHAMBERS.


[Captioner] 20:01:59
>> THAT'S CORRECT, ANY FLAG

[Captioner] 20:02:02
 DISPLAY THAT
WE'RE DISCUSSING IS CONTEMPLATED ON THE


[Captioner] 20:02:06
FLAGPOLE AND IN FRONT OF CITY HALL.


[Captioner] 20:02:09
>> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.
IS THERE A CHOICE IF YOU DO CEREMONIAL


[Captioner] 20:02:12
TO DO IT INSIDE AS OPPOSED

[Captioner] 20:02:15
 TO AT THE
FLAGPOLE?
AND JUST TRYING TO

[Captioner] 20:02:19
 INTERPRET THE ADMIN
GUIDELINES THERE.
>> City Mgr.

[Captioner] 20:02:22
 Shackelford: WELL, AND I
WOULD ADD THAT

[Captioner] 20:02:26
 THE CHARM OF HAVING IT

[Captioner] 20:02:29

RAISED OUTSIDE IN THE PARKING LOT ON
THAT FLAGPOLE IS THAT

[Captioner] 20:02:33
 SO THE ENTIRE
COMMUNITY

[Captioner] 20:02:36
 CAN SEE IT AND ENJOY IT AT ALL
TIMES AS OPPOSED TO

[Captioner] 20:02:39
 JUST WHEN COUNCIL
CHAMBERS ARE OPEN.
>> Councilmember

[Captioner] 20:02:42
 Cox: OKAY.
HAS THERE EVER

[Captioner] 20:02:46
 BEEN A THOUGHT PROCESS OF
YOU MAY DO IT OUTSIDE

[Captioner] 20:02:49
 BUT THEN SOME
CITIES HAVE

[Captioner] 20:02:52
 ROWS OF FLAGS THAT

[Captioner] 20:02:56
 REPRESENT
OTHER -- IT COULD BE

[Captioner] 20:02:59
 OTHER COUNTRIES OR
IT COULD BE

[Captioner] 20:03:02
 OTHER CULTURAL CELEBRATIONS
AND THEY HAVE THEM DISPLAY

[Captioner] 20:03:07
ED IN THEIR, I
GUESS, RECEPTION OR CITY

[Captioner] 20:03:11
 HALL AREA, I
KNOW WE HAVE --

[Captioner] 20:03:14
 TIGHT ON RESOURCES BUT
WAS THERE ANY OTHER INFORMATION YOU
GATHERED

[Captioner] 20:03:17
 FROM YOUR RESEARCH THAT TALKED
ABOUT THAT PART OF EVEN

[Captioner] 20:03:20
 HAVING OTHER
FLAGS THAT COULD BE DISPLAY

[Captioner] 20:03:24
ED AS
REPRESENTATION OF MAKING IT AT INCLUSIVE

[Captioner] 20:03:27

ENVIRONMENT AND HAVING THAT IN CITY HALL

[Captioner] 20:03:31

DISPLAYED?
SOME OF THEM EVEN HAVE CITY DUSH KNOW

[Captioner] 20:03:34

-- SISTER CITY COMMISSIONS THAT THEY

[Captioner] 20:03:36

HAVE FLAGS LIKE THAT IN THE CITY HALL.


[Captioner] 20:03:41
>> City Mgr. Shackelford: YES.
UNFORTUNATELY OUR RESEARCH DID

[Captioner] 20:03:44
 NOT
CONTEMPLATE THAT.
IT

[Captioner] 20:03:47
 WAS

[Captioner] 20:03:52
 PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON THE
TYPES OF FLAGS THAT WE'VE DISCUSSED HERE

[Captioner] 20:03:55

AT CITY COUNCIL, THE TYPES OF EVENTS OR

[Captioner] 20:03:58

HOLIDAYS OR INDIVIDUALS THAT WE'VE BEEN


[Captioner] 20:04:01
DISCUSSING AT OUR MEETINGS AND THAT
WE'RE INCLUDED IN

[Captioner] 20:04:04
 WERE INCLUDED IN THE
RECENT

[Captioner] 20:04:06
 REFERRALS.
>> Councilmember Cox: GOT IT.
THAT WAS HELPFUL.


[Captioner] 20:04:11
JUST WANTED TO DOUBLE-CHECK, AND WE DO
NOT HAVE

[Captioner] 20:04:14
 A SISTER CITIES COMMISSION,
IT'S NOT

[Captioner] 20:04:17
 AN OPERATION CURRENTLY, CORRECT?


[Captioner] 20:04:20
>> City Mgr. Shackelford: THAT'S
CORRECT, WE DO NOT.
>> Mayor Mei: WE HAVE MANY SISTER


[Captioner] 20:04:24
CITIES BUT WE'RE CURRENTLY NOT IN
OPERATION.
>> Councilmember Cox: I'M TALKING


[Captioner] 20:04:27
ABOUT THE COMMISSION, THE COMMISSION
THAT IS THE HOST OF THE SISTER CITIES

[Captioner] 20:04:28

ORGANIZATIONS.
OKAY.


[Captioner] 20:04:31
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:04:35
>> Mayor Mei: COUNCILMEMBER SHAO.
>> Councilmember Shao: THANK YOU,
MADAME MAYOR.


[Captioner] 20:04:39
I'M WONDERING WHETHER WE HAVE ALREADY
ENTERED INTO THE COMMENT STAGE

[Captioner] 20:04:41
 OR STILL
QUESTIONS?
>> Mayor Mei: SURE.


[Captioner] 20:04:44
SEEMS LIKE EVERYONE IS MAKING COMMENTS
TOO.


[Captioner] 20:04:48
>> Councilmember Shao: I JUST WANT TO
MAKE SOME OBSERVATIONAL COMMENTS.


[Captioner] 20:04:53
NOWADAYS, THE BUZZING WORD IS CHAT GPT
AND

[Captioner] 20:04:56
 I DID --

[Captioner] 20:04:59
 ON POLICIES ON NEIGHBORING
CITIES AND

[Captioner] 20:05:03
 FORTUNATELY THE A.I. GAVE ME
SIMILAR

[Captioner] 20:05:06
 ANSWERS TO WHAT THE STAFF HAS

[Captioner] 20:05:10

PROVIDED, EXCEPT THAT THEY ALSO
MENTIONED THAT THERE ARE

[Captioner] 20:05:14
 ADDITIONAL
OCCASIONS FOR EXAMPLE IN

[Captioner] 20:05:17
 THE CITY OF
SAN JOSÉ AND MILIPITAS THAT THEY ALSO

[Captioner] 20:05:21

RAISE FLAGS, MARTIN LUTHER KING JR.

[Captioner] 20:05:24
 DAY,
AS WELL AS VETERANS' DAY.
BUT THEY DIDN'T

[Captioner] 20:05:28
 SPECIFY THE TYPE OF FLAG
THEY

[Captioner] 20:05:31
 RAISE ON SUCH OCCASIONS.
OF

[Captioner] 20:05:35
 COURSE A.I. IS A.I., YOU CANNOT TAKE
EVERYTHING IT SAYS

[Captioner] 20:05:38
 FOR GRANTED.


[Captioner] 20:05:41
HOWEVER, I AM GLAD THAT THEY

[Captioner] 20:05:46
 ALSO

[Captioner] 20:05:49

MENTIONED VERY QUICKLY THE POLICY WAS
FIRST OF

[Captioner] 20:05:53
 ALL RESTRICTED TO

[Captioner] 20:05:56
 DISPLAY, AND
ALSO CONDUCTED BY THE CITY MANAGER OF
EACH

[Captioner] 20:05:59
 OF THOSE COUNTRIES, I BELIEVE I
SEARCHED

[Captioner] 20:06:03
 MILIPITAS AND SAN JOSÉ

[Captioner] 20:06:06
 AND
OAKLAND AND SAN FRANCISCO BY

[Captioner] 20:06:10

COINCIDENCE BEFORE CHATGPT SAID YOU
ASKED TOO

[Captioner] 20:06:13
 MANY QUESTIONS

[Captioner] 20:06:17
 AND YOU NOW ARE
DISABLED.
I

[Captioner] 20:06:21
 WELCOME THE STAFF'S RECOMMENDATION,
AND OUT OF THE

[Captioner] 20:06:25
 TWO, I -- LIKE
COUNCILMEMBER

[Captioner] 20:06:28
 SALWAN SAID, PREFER A

[Captioner] 20:06:31

CALENDAR THAT CAN BE REVIEWED AND
FINALIZED

[Captioner] 20:06:36
 EACH YEAR, PRESUMABLY AT THE
COUNCIL RETREAT

[Captioner] 20:06:40
 SO THAT IT IS THE
PERFECT OCCASION FOR

[Captioner] 20:06:45
 THE CITY COUNCIL

[Captioner] 20:06:48
 TO
SYNCHRONIZE OUR VALUE SINCE WE'RE USING

[Captioner] 20:06:51

THIS AS

[Captioner] 20:06:54
 OUR SPEECH FORUM ONLY, AND

[Captioner] 20:06:59
 ALSO
WITH NEW FLAGS BEING CREATED FOR

[Captioner] 20:07:02

EXISTING OCCASIONS SUCH AS

[Captioner] 20:07:06
 ASIAN
HERITAGE MONTH OR LUNAR NEW YEAR, I'M
STILL

[Captioner] 20:07:10
 SEARCHING AND COULDN'T FIND ANY,
BUT I BELIEVE IN THE

[Captioner] 20:07:14
 FUTURE, SUCH FLAGS
WILL BE CREATED.


[Captioner] 20:07:17
THEN WE CAN JUST ADD ON

[Captioner] 20:07:20
 THOSE ONE BY ONE
TO OUR HOLIDAYS FOR THE FLAG RAISING.
SO

[Captioner] 20:07:24
 I'M EXCITED THAT

[Captioner] 20:07:27
 MOST OF THE
COUNCIL IS OPEN TO

[Captioner] 20:07:31
 BEING INCLUSIVE AND I

[Captioner] 20:07:35

PREFER THE ANNUALLY DECIDED

[Captioner] 20:07:38
 LIST OF SUCH
OCCASIONS INSTEAD

[Captioner] 20:07:41
 OF INDIVIDUAL
REFERRALS.
THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 20:07:43

>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU, EVERYONE, FOR


[Captioner] 20:07:46
YOUR COMMENTS, AND I'M GLAD THERE IS
SOME CONSENSUS I'M

[Captioner] 20:07:49
 HEARING ON THE DAIS
AND IT SOUNDS LIKE WE'RE GOING TO BE
ABLE TO MAKE A MOTION.


[Captioner] 20:07:53
I AM IN CONCURRENCE OF THE IDEA OF

[Captioner] 20:07:56

TRYING TO DO A CONSISTENT POLICY,
ONE WHERE IT

[Captioner] 20:07:59
 ALLOWS US TO BE ABLE TO
HAVE A PRE-EXISTING LIST FROM THE
COUNCIL

[Captioner] 20:08:02
 AND THE GOOD PLACE WOULD BE THE
RETREAT, BECAUSE AGAIN,

[Captioner] 20:08:06
 THIS ACTION IS A
REFLECTION OF THE

[Captioner] 20:08:09
 COUNCIL'S MAJORITY'S
OPINIONS AND

[Captioner] 20:08:12
 SUPPORT AND REFLECTS OUR
BELIEFS AND STATEMENTS.
I ALSO THINK THAT

[Captioner] 20:08:15
 LOOKING AT JUST SOME
OF THE DATES, THERE ARE SOME YEARS

[Captioner] 20:08:17
 OR
SOME MONTHS WHERE THERE'S OVERLAP, SO IF


[Captioner] 20:08:21
WE'RE GOING TO GO WITH A TOTAL ONE-MONTH
PERIOD, 30

[Captioner] 20:08:24
 DAYS, THEN WE WOULD WANT TO
CONSIDER THAT AS A CONCERN TO

[Captioner] 20:08:27
 MAKE SURE
THAT WE ARE FAIR AND WE ALTERNATE,
PERHAPS, IN SOME

[Captioner] 20:08:30
 OF THOSE CASES.
SO IF

[Captioner] 20:08:33
 THERE IS INTEREST, I WOULD LIKE TO
CALL THE MOTION FOR THAT.


[Captioner] 20:08:39
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: THROUGH THE
CHAIR, HAVE WE TAKEN PUBLIC

[Captioner] 20:08:41
 COMMENTS?
>> Mayor Mei: YOU'RE CORRECT --
>> Councilmember Kassan: I HAD A


[Captioner] 20:08:44
QUESTION AND ALSO

[Captioner] 20:08:47
 ANOTHER
COMMENT.
ONE, I WOULD LIKE US TO AGREE THAT WE


[Captioner] 20:08:50
WILL NOT TRY TO HAVE A FLAG RAISING FOR
AN EVENT FOR WHICH THERE IS

[Captioner] 20:08:53
 NO
RECOGNIZED FLAG.
I THINK THAT'S A BIG WASTE OF TIME.


[Captioner] 20:08:58
AND SECOND OF ALL, I DON'T AGREE THAT
THE RETREAT IS A GOOD TIME

[Captioner] 20:09:02
 TO TALK ABOUT
DAYS THAT WE SHOULD DO FLAG RAISINGS.


[Captioner] 20:09:05
WE ONLY GET TO DO A RETREAT ONCE A YEAR
AND WE HAVE, I

[Captioner] 20:09:08
 THINK, ISSUES THAT ARE A
LOT MORE IMPORTANT TO DISCUSS.


[Captioner] 20:09:11
SO I WOULD NOT AGREE THAT WE SHOULD USE
UP

[Captioner] 20:09:14
 OUR TIME AT THE RETREAT TALKING ABOUT
WHEN TO DO FLAG

[Captioner] 20:09:17
 RAISINGS.
>> Mayor Mei: I WOULD -- I DON'T KNOW
IF

[Captioner] 20:09:20
 WE HAVE ANY SPEAKERS, BUT I WOULD
ALSO ADD THAT WHEN IT COMES TO

[Captioner] 20:09:23
 FLAGS,
OVER THE YEARS I'VE SEEN DIFFERENT FLAGS

[Captioner] 20:09:26

CREATED AND IN FACT FOR THE SCHOOL
DISTRICT, I WAS AROUND WHEN WE 

[Captioner] 20:09:30
CREATED
THE NEW SCHOOL DISTRICT FLAG, AND I
THINK EVEN

[Captioner] 20:09:33
 FOR PRIDE DAY, ORIGINALLY
WHEN WE FIRST STARTED IT, WE HAD IT

[Captioner] 20:09:36

FLOWN HERE, AT THE COUNCIL CHAMBER.
THERE

[Captioner] 20:09:39
 ARE EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES AS
TO WHY, AND I WOULD ALSO WANT TO INCLUDE

[Captioner] 20:09:42

THAT, AS TO WHY SOMETIMES WE CAN OR
CANNOT RAISE IT OUTSIDE

[Captioner] 20:09:45
 BECAUSE THERE
MAY BE INCIDENTS WHERE WE HAVE A FLAG AT

[Captioner] 20:09:48

HALF MAST AND THAT GOES AGAINST OUR
POLICIES.


[Captioner] 20:09:52
BUT I WOULD BE WILLING TO CONSIDER
THAT.
I

[Captioner] 20:09:55
 WOULD ALSO, LIKE I SAID, OVER A TIME

[Captioner] 20:09:58

PERIOD, WE'VE SEEN DIFFERENT FLAGS BEING


[Captioner] 20:10:01
CREATED FOR THE PRIDE AND FOR LGBTQ, FOR
TRANSGENDER, AND THAT HAS

[Captioner] 20:10:04
 ALSO CHANGED
AND EVOLVED, SO I'D LIKE TO BE ABLE TO


[Captioner] 20:10:07
CONSIDER THAT.
AND I'D LIKE TO HEAR FROM -- IF THERE
ARE ANY PUBLIC SPEAKERS AT

[Captioner] 20:10:10
 THIS TIME OR
--
>> Ms. Gauthier: NO.


[Captioner] 20:10:13
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY, THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 20:10:17
COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL, DID YOU HAVE
ANOTHER COMMENT?
I'D LIKE TO SEE IF THERE'S

[Captioner] 20:10:19
 A MOTION.
>> Councilmember Campbell: I WAS GOING


[Captioner] 20:10:22
TO TAKE A STAB AT A MOTION.
>> Councilmember Cox: BEFORE YOU MAKE
A

[Captioner] 20:10:24
 MOTION --
>> Mayor Mei: SHE'S SPEAKING RIGHT
NOW.


[Captioner] 20:10:27
>> Councilmember Cox: I WASN'T READY
TO VOTE YET IF WE'RE GOING

[Captioner] 20:10:29
 TO --
>> Councilmember Campbell: YOU DON'T
HAVE TO VOTE YET.


[Captioner] 20:10:32
I CAN STICK MAKE A MOTION, SOMEBODY CAN
SECOND IT AND YOU CAN STILL

[Captioner] 20:10:35
 TALK.
SO I'M GOING TO TRY TO TAKE A STAB AT
THIS.


[Captioner] 20:10:39
I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A MOTION TO ACCEPT

[Captioner] 20:10:43

STAFF'S RECOMMENDATION BUT TO INCLUDE A


[Captioner] 20:10:46
POLICY ON CRITERIA BY WHICH THE COUNCIL

[Captioner] 20:10:49

WOULD DECIDE ON WHETHER OR NOT TO ACCEPT

[Captioner] 20:10:52

A FLAG RAISING.
I WOULD ALSO

[Captioner] 20:10:56
 LIKE TO ADD TO THAT THAT WE

[Captioner] 20:11:00

DECIDE TO DO TWO TO THREE FLAG

[Captioner] 20:11:04
 RAISINGS
PER YEAR, AND THAT

[Captioner] 20:11:08
 WE DECIDE DURING SOME
POINT IN THE YEAR, WHETHER IT'S AT

[Captioner] 20:11:11
 THE
RETREAT OR AT ANOTHER

[Captioner] 20:11:14
 BOARD -- COUNCIL
MEETING, WHERE WE CAN DECIDE ON THOSE
TWO

[Captioner] 20:11:18
 OR THREE PER YEAR.
THAT WOULD BE MY

[Captioner] 20:11:21
 MOTION.


[Captioner] 20:11:25
>> Councilmember Salwan: CAN YOU
REPEAT THAT AGAIN ONE MORE TIME?
I GOT THE SECOND

[Captioner] 20:11:28
 PART.
REPEAT THE FIRST PART.
>> Councilmember Campbell: THAT THERE


[Captioner] 20:11:31
WOULD BE A SET OF CRITERIA BY WHICH WE
WOULD -- LIKE

[Captioner] 20:11:34
 A RUBIK'S CUBE, FOR
EXAMPLE, THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO

[Captioner] 20:11:38

CHECKLIST TO BE ABLE TO DETERMINE
WHETHER OR NOT

[Captioner] 20:11:41
 THAT FLAG RAISING --

[Captioner] 20:11:44
 THAT
CEREMONIAL FLAG

[Captioner] 20:11:48
 RAISING
MEETS THE CRITERIA BY WHICH WE WOULD

[Captioner] 20:11:51
 BE
ABLE TO RESPOND TO A YES ON IT.
>> Councilmember Salwan:

[Captioner] 20:11:53
 SO DOES THAT
MEAN STAFF WILL BRING THAT BACK TO US
ONE MORE TIME?


[Captioner] 20:11:55
>> Councilmember Campbell: YES.
>> Councilmember Salwan: OKAY.
OKAY, I'M FINE.


[Captioner] 20:11:59
>> City Mgr. Shackelford: AND ALSO THE
RECOMMENDED

[Captioner] 20:12:02
 STAFF RECOMMENDATION, I
THINK IS DIFFERENT THAN WHAT I'VE HEARD


[Captioner] 20:12:06
THE MAJORITY OF YOU ALL DISCUSS.
THE

[Captioner] 20:12:09
 RECOMMENDED STAFF RECOMMENDATION WAS
THAT YOU WOULD --

[Captioner] 20:12:12
 EACH COUNCILMEMBER
WOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO BRING A
REFERRAL BACK, AND IT

[Captioner] 20:12:15
 SOUNDS LIKE YOU
ALL ARE TALKING

[Captioner] 20:12:19
 ABOUT AN ANNUAL
CALENDAR.
>> Councilmember Campbell:


[Captioner] 20:12:22
COLLECTIVELY DECIDING WHICH TWO TO THREE
CEREMONIAL EVENTS WE WOULD

[Captioner] 20:12:25
 HOST DURING
THE MONTH.
AND I JUST PICK TWO

[Captioner] 20:12:29
 OR THREE BECAUSE I
HEARD ALLEN

[Captioner] 20:12:33
 SAY THAT WHEN HE HAD DONE
HIS RESEARCH, MOST OF THE

[Captioner] 20:12:36
 CITIES WERE
DOING TWO A YEAR.
THEY WERE

[Captioner] 20:12:39
 NOT DOING FIVE OR SIX OR SEVEN
OR EIGHT OR ANYTHING THAT WAS

[Captioner] 20:12:43
 REALLY
UNREASONABLE, AND I

[Captioner] 20:12:46
 HEARD OUR CITY
MANAGER SAY THE SAME THING IN

[Captioner] 20:12:50
 TERMS OF
OUR ABILITY

[Captioner] 20:12:53
 TO BE ABLE TO MANAGE
ANYTHING THAT

[Captioner] 20:12:57
 WAS MORE THAN

[Captioner] 20:13:00
 THREE IN A
CALENDAR YEAR.
BUT WE COULD ROTATE THROUGH EACH


[Captioner] 20:13:04
CALENDAR YEAR, WE DON'T HAVE TO DO THE
SAME ONES EVERY TIME.
WE COULD

[Captioner] 20:13:07
 DO A DIFFERENT TWO OR THREE
THIS YEAR, NEXT YEAR WE COULD

[Captioner] 20:13:10
 DO ANOTHER
TWO OR THREE, BECAUSE WE

[Captioner] 20:13:14
 HAVE A PRETTY
LONG LIST.


[Captioner] 20:13:17
>> Mayor Mei: COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN,
ARE YOU GOING TO SECOND OR DID YOU WANT

[Captioner] 20:13:19

TO --
>> Councilmember Salwan: I JUST WANT


[Captioner] 20:13:22
TO COMMENT ON THAT.
I THINK 21 IS TOO MANY.


[Captioner] 20:13:25
AND TWO TO THREE MIGHT BE TOO LITTLE.
BECAUSE WE ALREADY

[Captioner] 20:13:28
 HAVE TWO:  PRIDE
MONTH AND BLACK HISTORY MONTH.
SO THAT

[Captioner] 20:13:31
 ONLY LEAVES US ONE.
SO I THINK WE'VE GOT TO FIND SOME

[Captioner] 20:13:34

SCALING WHERE WE CAN SCALE UP OVER
TIME.


[Captioner] 20:13:38
SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT NUMBER IS, BUT
I THINK THREE

[Captioner] 20:13:41
 MIGHT BE TOO
SELF-LIMITING, BECAUSE IF WE HAVE --

[Captioner] 20:13:44
 WE
HAVEN'T HAD 21 DAYS, WE'VE GOT TO
PROCESS

[Captioner] 20:13:47
 AND FIGURE OUT WHICH WE'RE GOING

[Captioner] 20:13:51

TO GO WITH, SO I THINK WE NEED A LITTLE

[Captioner] 20:13:53

MORE LEEWAY.
I DON'T KNOW THAT WE NEED TO RESTRICT 

[Captioner] 20:13:55
IT
THAT MUCH AT THAT POINT.
>> Councilmember Campbell: ARE YOU


[Captioner] 20:13:59
ASKING ME TO REFRAME MY MOTION TO
SAY --
>> Councilmember Salwan: IF YOU'RE

[Captioner] 20:14:02

OPEN TO A LITTLE MORE THAN THAT.


[Captioner] 20:14:06
>> Councilmember Campbell: I STILL
THINK

[Captioner] 20:14:10
 THAT -- I MEAN, CAPACITY IS ALWAYS
A

[Captioner] 20:14:13
 PROBLEM.
>> Councilmember Salwan: I AGREE.
>> Councilmember Campbell: WHEN YOU'RE

[Captioner] 20:14:16

TRYING TO DO THINGS LIKE THIS.
AND WHEN WE CAN DETERMINE WHAT THAT

[Captioner] 20:14:19

CAPACITY LEVEL IS SO THAT WE CAN DO IT


[Captioner] 20:14:22
AND DO IT WELL, I MEAN, WE JUST DON'T
WANT TO DO IT FOR THE SAKE

[Captioner] 20:14:25
 OF DOING IT.
WE WANT TO DO IT AND DO IT WELL.
AND

[Captioner] 20:14:28
 SO WHAT IS THE CAPACITY

[Captioner] 20:14:33
 THAT THE
CITY BELIEVES THAT THEY CAN MANAGE SO
THAT THEY COULD

[Captioner] 20:14:36
 DO IT WELL.
BUT LIKE NOT FORGET

[Captioner] 20:14:39
 OR SOMEBODY IS SICK
THE DAY AND YOU COULDN'T

[Captioner] 20:14:42
 GET THE FLAG UP
BECAUSE THE PERSON WHO WAS RESPONSIBLE


[Captioner] 20:14:46
FOR IT AND -- YOU KNOW, SO THERE'S ALL
KINDS OF

[Captioner] 20:14:49
 EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES

[Captioner] 20:14:52
 THAT
WILL MAYBE CAUSE US TO NOT BE ABLE TO
DELIVER AND DELIVER

[Captioner] 20:14:56
 WELL.
>> Mayor Mei: I DO KNOW ONE OF THE
THINGS WE

[Captioner] 20:14:59
 TALK ABOUT IS THE PUBLIC INPUT
AND REPRESENTATION,

[Captioner] 20:15:02
 AND I'D HEARD FROM
THE INDIAN COMMUNITY, FOR EXAMPLE, AT
LEAST YOU HEARD FROM

[Captioner] 20:15:05
 THE SPEAKERS

[Captioner] 20:15:08

TONIGHT, WHILE THEY HAVE INDIAN REPUBLIC


[Captioner] 20:15:11
DAY AND INDEPENDENCE DAY THEY CENTER
PRETTY MUCH ON IT

[Captioner] 20:15:15
 SOUNDS LIKE DIWALI.
AND FOR OTHER GROUPS,

[Captioner] 20:15:18
 WE'RE ONE OF THE
LARGEST ASIAN CITIES, I KNOW THERE'S NO

[Captioner] 20:15:22

API FLAG PER SE TODAY, BUT I THINK IT
WOULD BEHOOVE US

[Captioner] 20:15:25
 TO ACTUALLY -- I MEAN,
ASIAN HERITAGE WEEK STARTED IN

[Captioner] 20:15:28

1970-SOMETHING, SO IT'S BEEN ONE OF THE


[Captioner] 20:15:32
LONGEST STANDING, AND IT'S ALSO A
REFLECTION OF OUR COMMUNITY.


[Captioner] 20:15:35
AND SO I THINK THAT THAT WOULD BE
SOMETHING WE'D WANT

[Captioner] 20:15:38
 TO FIGURE OUT IF WE
CAN CONSOLIDATE, EVEN WHEN IT CAME

[Captioner] 20:15:41
 TO --
I ORIGINALLY HAD PROPOSED DEAF

[Captioner] 20:15:44
 AWARENESS
MONTH AND BLIND AWARENESS MONTH, BUT
THEY WERE SAYING,

[Captioner] 20:15:48
 WELL, MAYBE THERE'S A
DAY FOR PHYSICAL EQUITY

[Captioner] 20:15:51
 FOR ACCESS FOR

[Captioner] 20:15:54
 ADA, THEY FOCUS ON A DAY
THAT THEY CAN CONSOLIDATE.
SO IF WE

[Captioner] 20:15:57
 CAN COME TO SOME SORT OF A

[Captioner] 20:15:59

CONSENSUS, THAT WOULD BE THE BEST WAY TO


[Captioner] 20:16:02
REFLECT OUR COMMUNITY AND REFLECT OUR
INTEREST IN MAKING SURE PEOPLE ARE

[Captioner] 20:16:03

REPRESENTED.
>> Councilmember Campbell: SO WOULD


[Captioner] 20:16:07
FIVE BE A REASONABLE NUMBER?
>> Councilmember Salwan: YEAH, I WOULD

[Captioner] 20:16:08

BE OKAY WITH FIVE.
>> Councilmember Campbell: OKAY.


[Captioner] 20:16:11
THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: SO WE HAVE A MOTION AND
A SECOND.


[Captioner] 20:16:16
COUNCILMEMBER COX, DID YOU WANT TO MAKE
A COMMENT, I THINK?


[Captioner] 20:16:20
>> Councilmember Cox: SO BASICALLY WE
ARE NOT GOING TO

[Captioner] 20:16:23
 ADOPT THE STAFF
RECOMMENDATION TONIGHT BUT WE

[Captioner] 20:16:26
 ARE GOING
TO LOOK AT IT AS CRITERIA

[Captioner] 20:16:29
 SET ADDED ON
TO THE STAFF RECOMMENDATION

[Captioner] 20:16:33
 OR SEPARATE
STANDALONE?
THAT'S WHAT I

[Captioner] 20:16:36
 WANTED TO TRY TO BE CLEAR
ON.
ON YOUR MOTION.


[Captioner] 20:16:40
>> Councilmember Campbell: OKAY, I'M
GOING TO TRY IT ONE MORE TIME.
SO I

[Captioner] 20:16:43
 WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A MOTION

[Captioner] 20:16:46
 TO --
REASON WHY I WAS SAYING ACCEPT STAFF'S


[Captioner] 20:16:49
RECOMMENDATION IS BECAUSE I LIKE THE
FACT THAT IT A

[Captioner] 20:16:53
 COUNCIL DECISION.


[Captioner] 20:16:56
SO THE PIECE OF IT THAT I'D LIKE IN THE
MOTION

[Captioner] 20:16:59
 IS THAT IT'S STAFF

[Captioner] 20:17:02

STAFF'S VOICE, VALUES,

[Captioner] 20:17:04
 ALL THE THINGS
THAT YOU MENTIONED IN YOUR
RECOMMENDATION.


[Captioner] 20:17:07
BUT I WANT TO ADD TO THAT, THAT WE WOULD
MAKE

[Captioner] 20:17:11
 SURE THAT THERE WAS SOME SET
CRITERIA,

[Captioner] 20:17:14
 A RUBIK'S CUBE, A
CHECKLIST OF SOME SORT

[Captioner] 20:17:17
 TO HELP GUIDE OUR
DECISION ON WHAT

[Captioner] 20:17:20
 THOSE ADDITIONAL THREE
ARE GOING TO BE.


[Captioner] 20:17:24
SO -- AND THEN THERE WOULD BE A LIST
THAT WE WOULD

[Captioner] 20:17:27
 APPROVE AS A BODY

[Captioner] 20:17:30
 OF THREE
MORE BECAUSE WE ALREADY HAVE TWO THAT'S


[Captioner] 20:17:34
BEEN APPROVED, SO THERE WILL BE THREE
MORE, AND

[Captioner] 20:17:38
 THAT WE COULD DO IT EITHER --
AND I KIND

[Captioner] 20:17:41
 OF AGREE WITH COUNCILMEMBER
KASSAN THAT MAYBE THE RETREAT IS NOT

[Captioner] 20:17:44
 THE BEST

[Captioner] 20:17:48
 PLACE TO DO IT
BECAUSE WE DO HAVE LOTS OF

[Captioner] 20:17:51
 AND LOTS
OF --

[Captioner] 20:17:54
 VISION, WHERE WE WANT TO GO AS A
CITY DURING THAT TIME,

[Captioner] 20:17:57
 SO I'D RATHER USE
THAT TIME TO FOCUS ON

[Captioner] 20:18:00
 THAT BUT AT SOME
OTHER MEETING TIME, WE

[Captioner] 20:18:03
 WOULD DECIDE ON
THE ADDITIONAL THREE.
DOES THAT MAKE SENSE?


[Captioner] 20:18:07
>> Councilmember Cox: YES.
>> Councilmember Campbell: SUSAN, DID

[Captioner] 20:18:10

I CONFUSE YOU?
>> Councilmember Cox: SO THAT HELPED


[Captioner] 20:18:13
ME -- SO STAFF RECOMMENDATION PLUS THE
CRITERIA IS KIND OF WHAT WE'RE

[Captioner] 20:18:16
 SAYING,
WHAT YOUR MOTION IS?
OKAY.


[Captioner] 20:18:19
AND THEN WITH THE

[Captioner] 20:18:23
 FIVE CEREMONIAL FLAG
RAISINGS?
THAT'S

[Captioner] 20:18:25
 THE WHOLE PACKAGE THAT WE'RE
VOTING ON?
OKAY.


[Captioner] 20:18:29
AND THEN MAYBE WE'LL HAVE TO MAKE
ANOTHER

[Captioner] 20:18:32
 MOTION ABOUT DECIDING TO DO

[Captioner] 20:18:35
 IT
AT THE RETREAT OR NOT AT THE RETREAT

[Captioner] 20:18:37
 AS
PART 2.
>> Councilmember Campbell: THAT'S 

[Captioner] 20:18:40
PART
OF MY MOTION.
IS THAT WE DECIDE AT A

[Captioner] 20:18:43
 MEETING TIME, AND
IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO BE AT THE


[Captioner] 20:18:48
RETREAT.
KOCH

[Captioner] 20:18:54

>> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.
>> Councilmember Campbell: BUT THAT 

[Captioner] 20:18:58
WE
DO IT COLLECTIVELY AS A BODY.
>>

[Captioner] 20:19:01
 THAT LAST PART WASN'T PART OF THE
MOTION SO I WANT TO MAKE SURE THE
INDIVIDUAL THAT

[Captioner] 20:19:04
 SECONDED IS COMFORTABLE
WITH THE LANGUAGE.
>> Councilmember Salwan: WHICH


[Captioner] 20:19:07
PORTION?
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: THAT IT WILL
NOT BE

[Captioner] 20:19:10
 NECESSARILY DECIDED AT THE
RETREAT.
>> Councilmember Salwan: I REALLY


[Captioner] 20:19:13
DON'T CARE.
IF STAFF HAS TIME AT THE RETREAT, IT'S A


[Captioner] 20:19:15
GREAT TIME.
IF THEY DON'T, IT CAN BE A DIFFERENT
TIME.


[Captioner] 20:19:19
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE RETREAT.
HOWEVER, ONE ADVANTAGE OF A

[Captioner] 20:19:22

RETREAT-TYPESETTING IS MORE INFORMAL,
AND INSTEAD OF BEING UP

[Captioner] 20:19:26
 HERE ON TV AND
IT CAN BE MORE LOOKING AT EACH

[Captioner] 20:19:29
 OTHER
ACROSS THE TABLE.
SO IT'S SOMETIMES A MORE

[Captioner] 20:19:31
 COLLABORATIVE
SETTING SO SOMETIMES YOU CAN GET A LOT


[Captioner] 20:19:35
MORE DONE IN A SHORTER PERIOD OF TIME,
BUT I'M HOPE, I'M FLEXIBLE TO STAFF

[Captioner] 20:19:37
 AND
DEFER TO THAT.
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: OBVIOUSLY 

[Captioner] 20:19:40
FOR
THIS YEAR IT WOULDN'T HAPPEN AT OUR
RETREAT BUT NOTED FOR THE FUTURE.


[Captioner] 20:19:43
AND I DO WANT TO CLARIFY ONE ASPECT OF
THE RECOMMENDATION FOR

[Captioner] 20:19:47
 CLARITY OF
RECORD.
THE MOTION DOES

[Captioner] 20:19:52
 NOT ACTUALLY ACCEPT
STAFF'S RECOMMENDATION ON

[Captioner] 20:19:55
 NUMBER ONE
BECAUSE IT ESSENTIALLY PRECLUDES, MY
UNDERSTANDING OF YOUR MOTION IS THAT 

[Captioner] 20:19:59
IT
WOULD PRECLUDE INDIVIDUAL REQUESTS BY
COUNCILMEMBERS AND THE CITY MANAGER

[Captioner] 20:20:03

REGARDING NEW REQUESTS.
IT WOULD JUST BE THE FIVE PER

[Captioner] 20:20:06
 YEAR PER
CAP, IS THAT CORRECT, COUNCILMEMBER
CAMPBELL?


[Captioner] 20:20:09
>> Councilmember Campbell: YES.
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I WAS SAYING.


[Captioner] 20:20:12
YOU SAID IT SHORTLY.
I THINK I SAID IT THE LONG WAY.


[Captioner] 20:20:16
>> Councilmember Salwan: AND JUST
OPERATIONALLY, WE'LL DO WHAT THE

[Captioner] 20:20:20
 CITY
STAFF RECOMMENDED.
THIS IS GOING TO BE

[Captioner] 20:20:23
 COUNCIL SPEECH AND
IS CONDUCTED BY

[Captioner] 20:20:26
 THE CITY, AND WE'RE
DECIDING WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A CALENDAR

[Captioner] 20:20:29

OF FIVE FLAG RAISINGS FOR THIS NEXT YEAR

[Captioner] 20:20:32

YEAR.
>> Mayor Mei: THE ONLY THING I THIS 

[Captioner] 20:20:35
IS
ALSO THAT THE STAFF MENTIONED THAT I
THINK IS IMPORTANT IS BECAUSE THE

[Captioner] 20:20:38
 STAFF
IS PRECURING, RAISING AND

[Captioner] 20:20:41
 HANDLING THE
FLAG RAISING, WE'RE GOING TO KEEP IT
CONSISTENT.


[Captioner] 20:20:44
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FROM THAT
PERSPECTIVE, THAT WE DON'T HAVE ONE
GROUP BEING

[Captioner] 20:20:48
 TREATED DIFFERENTLY THAN
OTHERS.
I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT TO MAKE IT

[Captioner] 20:20:51

CONSISTENT.
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN.


[Captioner] 20:20:54
>> Councilmember Kassan: I'D LIKE TO
ARGUE IN FAVOR OF STAFF'S RECOMMENDATION


[Captioner] 20:20:57
THAT WE DON'T PUT TOGETHER A CALENDAR.


[Captioner] 20:21:00
I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT

[Captioner] 20:21:03
 THAT
COUNCILMEMBERS TAKE THE TIME TO ADVOCATE


[Captioner] 20:21:06
FOR WHAT THEY BELIEVE IS IMPORTANT, AND
THEY TAKE

[Captioner] 20:21:09
 THE TIME AS COUNCILMEMBER COX
DID TO DO THE

[Captioner] 20:21:13
 RESEARCH ABOUT HOW IT
WOULD -- YOU KNOW, WHETHER THERE EVEN
HAVE

[Captioner] 20:21:16
 A FLAG AND WHY -- THE

[Captioner] 20:21:20
 ARGUMENTS IN
FAVOR OF DOING IT.
I THINK IT GOING TO BE VERY,

[Captioner] 20:21:23
 VERY HARD.
THERE WILL NOT BE CONSENSUS

[Captioner] 20:21:26
 FOR FIVE OR
THREE

[Captioner] 20:21:29
 ADDITIONAL EVENTS.
WE HAVE MANY, MANY DIFFERENT GROUPS OF


[Captioner] 20:21:33
PEOPLE, DIFFERENT ETHNICITIES, DIFFERENT
RELIGIONS, PEOPLE FROM DIFFERENT

[Captioner] 20:21:35

COUNTRIES, PEOPLE WITH DIFFERENT
DISABILITIES.


[Captioner] 20:21:38
THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO WAY THAT WE

[Captioner] 20:21:41
 CAN
COVER EVERYONE WITH THREE ADDITIONAL
FLAG

[Captioner] 20:21:46
 RAISINGS.
AND IF WE DO SOMETHING THAT

[Captioner] 20:21:50
 RECOGNIZES
ONE RELIGION AND NOT ANOTHER RELIGION

[Captioner] 20:21:53
,
THAT'S GOING TO REALLY UPSET SOME
PEOPLE.


[Captioner] 20:21:56
SO I WOULD REALLY ADVOCATE THAT WE GO
WITH STAFF

[Captioner] 20:21:59
 RECOMMENDATION WHERE EACH
INDIVIDUAL PERSON -- THE ONLY PERSON

[Captioner] 20:22:02
 WHO
HAS DONE THIS, YOU KNOW, I DON'T
REMEMBER EXACTLY WHAT

[Captioner] 20:22:05
 HAPPENED WITH THE
GAY PRIDE FLAG, THAT WAS

[Captioner] 20:22:08
 A WHILE AGO, I
THINK COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN BROUGHT THAT,


[Captioner] 20:22:12
BUT IN RECENT HISTORY, ONLY ONE
COUNCILMEMBER

[Captioner] 20:22:15
 HAS BROUGHT A PROPOSAL TO
DO A FLAG RAISING IN

[Captioner] 20:22:18
 A WAY THAT WAS
SERIOUS AND THAT WE COULD VOTE ON,

[Captioner] 20:22:21
 AND I
DON'T THINK WE SHOULD -- I DON'T

[Captioner] 20:22:24

THINK -- I THINK IF ANYONE WANTS
ADDITIONAL FLAG RAISINGS,

[Captioner] 20:22:28
 THEY SHOULD DO
THE WORK TO BRING THAT TO COUNCIL AND
CONVINCE

[Captioner] 20:22:31
 THEIR FELLOW COUNCILMEMBERS

[Captioner] 20:22:35
 TO
AGREE WITH THEM.
I

[Captioner] 20:22:38
 WILL PERSONALLY NOT PARTICIPATE IN
PICKING THREE ADDITIONAL FLAG

[Captioner] 20:22:41
 RAISINGS.
I WILL COMPLETELY BOW OUT OF THAT

[Captioner] 20:22:44

BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THAT'S GOING TO
UPSET A LOT OF PEOPLE.


[Captioner] 20:22:47
THERE'S NO WAY THAT THERE'S ONLY THREE
GROUPS OF PEOPLE THAT ARE

[Captioner] 20:22:50
 GOING TO --
THAT WE CAN RECOGNIZE WITH THREE
ADDITIONAL FLAG

[Captioner] 20:22:53
 RAISINGS AND NOT HAVE
OTHER PEOPLE BE UPSET, AND I THINK IT'S


[Captioner] 20:22:57
A TERRIBLE IDEA.


[Captioner] 20:23:03
>> Mayor Mei: WE HAVE A MOTION AND
SECOND.
PLEASE, I'D LIKE

[Captioner] 20:23:06
 TO CALL THE VOTE.


[Captioner] 20:23:17
>> Ms. Gauthier: COUNCILMEMBER COX.


[Captioner] 20:23:20
>> Mayor Mei: THE MOTION PASSES WITH
COUNCILMEMBER KA

[Captioner] 20:23:23
 KASSAN VOTING NAY.


[Captioner] 20:23:30
OKAY.
NEXT ON

[Captioner] 20:23:33
 OUR CALENDAR IS APPOINTMENTS TO
BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS AND COMMITTEES

[Captioner] 20:23:37
.
I HAVE

[Captioner] 20:23:40
 APPOINTED SEVERAL PEOPLE TO OUR
SENIOR CITIZENS COMMISSION WHICH I
MENTIONED WE

[Captioner] 20:23:44
 HAVE STILL SEVERAL
VACANCIES ON

[Captioner] 20:23:47
.
AS WELL AS TO OUR

[Captioner] 20:23:50
 GEORGE PATTERSON HOUSE
ADVISORY BOARD.


[Captioner] 20:23:54
AND WE ALSO HAVE VACANCIES STILL ON THAT
TOO

[Captioner] 20:23:58
.
SO I WOULD LIKE TO ASK IF THERE'S ANY

[Captioner] 20:24:00

MOTION BY COUNCILMEMBER SHAO, SECONDED


[Captioner] 20:24:03
BY COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN.


[Captioner] 20:24:08
PLEASE VOTE.


[Captioner] 20:24:13
AND THE APPOINTMENTS PASS UNANIMOUSLY.


[Captioner] 20:24:20
AND AT THIS TIME ALSO THERE'S A REPORT
ON COMMITTEE ASSIGNMENTS.


[Captioner] 20:24:24
IF ANYONE HAS AN UPDATE ON ANY OF THE
COMMITTEES?
THAT

[Captioner] 20:24:27
 THEY'D LIKE TO SHARE?
COUNCILMEMBER COX, DID YOU HAVE
SOMETHING YOU WANT TO

[Captioner] 20:24:29
 SHARE FROM A
COMMISSION?
>> Councilmember Cox: YES, I DO.


[Captioner] 20:24:35
AS YOU KNOW, I SIT ON THE EAST

[Captioner] 20:24:39
 BAY
ENERGY BOARD AND THEY

[Captioner] 20:24:42
 DO HAVE FUNDING, A
LOCAL SPONSORSHIP FOR NON-PROFITS THAT


[Captioner] 20:24:45
CAN APPLY UP TO $2,500, AND IT'S CALLED

[Captioner] 20:24:49

FERTILE GROUNDS WORKS, AND IT'S A
MISSION BASICALLY

[Captioner] 20:24:52
 TO EMPOWER AND TEACH A
COMMUNITY TO GROW NUTRITIOUS

[Captioner] 20:24:55
 FOOD,
ORGANICALLY AND SUSTAINABLY,

[Captioner] 20:24:59
 AND SO EAST
BAY COMMUNITY

[Captioner] 20:25:02
 ENERGY IS A BIG SPONSOR OF
THIS MISSION, AND

[Captioner] 20:25:05
 EVERYONE THAT WOULD
LIKE TO APPLY FOR LOCAL

[Captioner] 20:25:08
 SPONSORSHIP
SHOULD APPLY BY MARCH

[Captioner] 20:25:12
 31ST AND YOU CAN
GO ON TO THEIR WEBSITE AT EBCE.ORG.
THANK

[Captioner] 20:25:15
 YOU.


[Captioner] 20:25:20
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
ARE THERE ANY OTHER COMMENTS?
OKAY.


[Captioner] 20:25:23
OTHER THAN THAT, I WAS GOING TO SAY, I
KNOW THE LEAGUE

[Captioner] 20:25:26
 OF CALIFORNIA CITIES HAS
ALSO

[Captioner] 20:25:31
 LEGISLATIVE OPPORTUNITIES COMING UP
AT THEIR NEXT MEETING.
I KNOW

[Captioner] 20:25:34
 COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN SERVES AS
THEIR VICE PRESIDENT, AND THAT WILL BE

[Captioner] 20:25:36
 A
LEGISLATIVE UPDATE THAT I THINK -- HAVE


[Captioner] 20:25:39
THEY SET THE LOCATION IN MARCH WHERE
THAT'S GOING TO

[Captioner] 20:25:43
 BE?


[Captioner] 20:25:46
>> Councilmember Salwan: I DON'T HAVE
THAT HANDY RIGHT NOW, MAYOR.
>> Mayor Mei: THAT'S

[Captioner] 20:25:49
 OKAY.
IT'S A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO BE
ABLE TO REPRESENT

[Captioner] 20:25:52
 AND AS THE BUDGETS ARE
BEING PUSHED FORWARD RIGHT NOW BY STATE,


[Captioner] 20:25:55
I HAVE WRITTEN SOME LETTERS AND I'M
HAPPY TO SHARE THAT IN TERMS OF

[Captioner] 20:25:57
 PROJECTS
WE'RE CONTINUING TO PUSH FOR, AND WE'LL


[Captioner] 20:26:01
BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THOSE IN OUR BUDGET
DISCUSSIONS BUT THOSE INCLUDE THINGS

[Captioner] 20:26:04

LIKE OUR INFRASTRUCTURE, PUBLIC WIFI
ACCESS AND A

[Captioner] 20:26:07
 PARTICULAR -- ONE OF OUR
GREATER CHALLENGES WHICH WE'VE HAD
REPEATED DISCUSSIONS ON, WHICH

[Captioner] 20:26:10
 IS
SERVING HOMELESSNESS.
SO THANK YOU SO MUCH, AND WE LOOK

[Captioner] 20:26:14

FORWARD TO ANYONE WHO'S INTERESTED IN
FOLLOWING, WE

[Captioner] 20:26:18
 HAVE OUR COUNCIL
PRIORITIES AND PRINCIPLES

[Captioner] 20:26:21
 AND OTHER
DISCUSSIONS IN TERMS OF THE NEXT YEAR
COMING UP

[Captioner] 20:26:24
 AT OUR RETREAT.
SO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME.


[Captioner] 20:26:28
I ALSO WANT TO THANK ALL OF OUR PUBLIC
SAFETY WORKERS.
I KNOW TODAY HAS BEEN A

[Captioner] 20:26:30
 LITTLE BUILT OF
A HECTIC DAY WITH ALL THE WIND AND STORM


[Captioner] 20:26:33
THAT ARE GOING ON, AND WE APPRECIATE THE
HELP IN THIS TIME PERIOD.


[Captioner] 20:26:36
AND THAT WE WOULD LIKE ALL PEOPLE TO BE
PATIENT, TO

[Captioner] 20:26:39
 BE KIND AND TO BE SAFE.
SO THANK YOU.
HAVE

[Captioner] 20:26:42
 A WONDERFUL EVENING.
MEETING IS
