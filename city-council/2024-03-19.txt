WE HAVE A JANITOR HERE WHO WORKS

[Captioner] 19:26:01
CITY OF FREMONT USED TO BE A

MY COLLEAGUES AND I ARE 

[Captioner] 19:28:13
APPEARING BEFORE YOU TODAY TO

ADVOCATE FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION 

[Captioner] 19:28:15
OF A RESPONSIBLE CONTRACTING 

[Captioner] 19:28:16
POLICY.

[Captioner] 19:28:18
THIS POLICY WILL EXCLUSIVELY 

[Captioner] 19:28:19
ALLOW COMPANIES WITH COLLECTIVE 

[Captioner] 19:28:21
BARGAINING AGREEMENTS TO BID FOR 

[Captioner] 19:28:22
CLEANING SERVICES CONTRACTS.

[Captioner] 19:28:25
CURRENTLY I AM FACING A 

[Captioner] 19:28:26
CHALLENGING SITUATION AFTER 

[Captioner] 19:28:29
UNDERGOING SURGERY A FEW MONTHS 

[Captioner] 19:28:30
AGO, I'M CURRENTLY IN THE 

[Captioner] 19:28:31
PROCESS OF RECOVERY.

[Captioner] 19:28:32
THE ONLY REASON I WAS ABLE TO 

[Captioner] 19:28:34
AFFORD THE SURGERY WAS BY 

[Captioner] 19:28:36
QUALIFYING FOR EMERGENCY MEDICAL 

[Captioner] 19:28:36
ASSISTANCE.

[Captioner] 19:28:38
UNFORTUNATELY THIS IS THE ONLY 

[Captioner] 19:28:40
TYPE OF MEDICAL SUPPORT FOR 

[Captioner] 19:28:41
WHICH I AM ELIGIBLE.

[Captioner] 19:28:43
DESPITE EARNING ENOUGH NOT TO 

[Captioner] 19:28:45
MEET THE STANDARD INCOME 

[Captioner] 19:28:48
REQUIREMENTS FOR REGULAR MEDICAL 

[Captioner] 19:28:49
ASSISTANCE, I DO NOT EARN ENOUGH 

[Captioner] 19:28:54
TO COMFORTABLY AFFORD THE

[Captioner] 19:28:58

TYPE OF MEDICAL SUPPORT FOR 

[Captioner] 19:29:17
WHICH I AM ELIGIBLE.

[Captioner] 19:29:19

[Captioner] 19:29:21
MEET THE STANDARD INCOME 

[Captioner] 19:29:23
REQUIREMENTS FOR REGULAR MEDICAL 

[Captioner] 19:29:25
ASSISTANCE, I DO NOT EARN ENOUGH 

[Captioner] 19:29:28
TO COMFORTABLY AFFORD THE HEALTH 

[Captioner] 19:29:30
INSURANCE PROVIDED BY SWA WHICH 

[Captioner] 19:29:33
AMOUNTS TO BETWEEN 500 AND $600 

[Captioner] 19:29:34
PER PAYCHECK.

[Captioner] 19:29:37
THIS FINANCIAL BURDEN IS 

[Captioner] 19:29:39
EXASPERATED BY THE ABSENCE OF A 

[Captioner] 19:29:41
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT 

[Captioner] 19:29:42
GUARANTEEING WAGE INCREASES.

[Captioner] 19:29:44
MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES ARE 

[Captioner] 19:29:45
STRUGGLING SIMILARLY.

[Captioner] 19:29:47
SOME HAVE UNDERLYING HEALTH 

[Captioner] 19:29:49
CONDITIONS AND HAVE HAD TO 

[Captioner] 19:29:50
ENDURE SIGNIFICANT OUT OF POCKET 

[Captioner] 19:29:52
EXPENSES FOR MEDICAL TREATMENT.

[Captioner] 19:29:54
DESPITE OUR DEDICATION TO 

[Captioner] 19:29:56
MAINTAINING THE CLEANLINESS OF 

[Captioner] 19:29:57
CITY BUILDINGS SUCH AS THOSE 

[Captioner] 19:29:58
HERE IN FREMONT, WE DO NOT 

[Captioner] 19:29:59
RECEIVE HEALTHCARE COVERAGE OR 

[Captioner] 19:30:00
WAGE INCREASES.

[Captioner] 19:30:02
ESTABLISHING A COLLECTIVE 

[Captioner] 19:30:03
BARGAINING AGREEMENT WOULD 

[Captioner] 19:30:05
EMPOWER US, THE WORKERS, TO 

[Captioner] 19:30:07
NEGOTIATE ESSENTIAL BENEFITS, 

[Captioner] 19:30:09
BETTER WORKING CONDITIONS AND 

[Captioner] 19:30:10
ULTIMATELY A BETTER QUALITY OF 

[Captioner] 19:30:11

FROM COUNCILMEMBERS FOR THE

[Captioner] 19:36:03
COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL.

[Captioner] 19:36:05
>> Councilmember Campbell: HI.

[Captioner] 19:36:06
THANK YOU FOR YOUR REPORT.

[Captioner] 19:36:10
I JUST HAVE A COUPLE QUICK 

[Captioner] 19:36:10
QUESTIONS.

[Captioner] 19:36:14
ONE IS, I SAW THAT

[Captioner] 19:36:18
 THE COMPLAINT WAS THAT THIS WAS 

[Captioner] 19:36:20
-- THE TOWER WAS TOO TALL, AND 

[Captioner] 19:36:24
THEY MADE A RECOMMENDATION THAT

[Captioner] 19:36:27
 THE -- IT BE SOMETHING LIKE 60 

[Captioner] 19:36:27
FEET.

[Captioner] 19:36:29
IS THERE A REASON WHY IT 

[Captioner] 19:36:30
COULDN'T BE SHORTER?

[Captioner] 19:36:34
>> SO THE WIRELESS FACILITIES 

[Captioner] 19:36:36
DESIGN THEIR TOWERS TO MEET 

[Captioner] 19:36:37
THEIR MINIMUM COVERAGE NEEDS, SO 

[Captioner] 19:36:38
THIS WAS THE HEIGHT THAT THEY 

[Captioner] 19:36:40
DETERMINED IS THE MINIMUM HEIGHT 

[Captioner] 19:36:41
REQUIREMENT TO GET THE COVERAGE 

[Captioner] 19:36:42
AREA THAT'S REQUIRED TO FILL 

[Captioner] 19:36:43
THAT SERVICE GAP.

[Captioner] 19:36:44
>> Councilmember Campbell: I 

[Captioner] 19:36:44
SEE.

[Captioner] 19:36:47
AND THEN ALSO THERE WAS A TANK 

[Captioner] 19:36:48
THAT'S FILLED WITH FLUID.

[Captioner] 19:36:51
WHAT'S GOING TO BE IN THAT 

[Captioner] 19:36:51
TANK?

[Captioner] 19:36:53
>> THERE WOULD BE AN EMERGENCY 

[Captioner] 19:36:53
GENERATOR ON SITE, SO IT WOULD 

[Captioner] 19:36:55
BE THE FUEL FOR THE GENERATOR.

[Captioner] 19:36:58
>> Councilmember Campbell: GAS?

[Captioner] 19:37:00
>> GASOLINE FOR THE GENERATOR, 

[Captioner] 19:37:00
YES.

[Captioner] 19:37:01
>> Councilmember Campbell: AND 

[Captioner] 19:37:02
WHAT ABOUT ON FIRE PROTECTION, 

[Captioner] 19:37:04
IF IT'S GOING TO BE GASOLINE?

[Captioner] 19:37:06
>> SO IT GOES THROUGH DURING 

[Captioner] 19:37:07
CONSTRUCTION, IT WILL MEET ALL 

[Captioner] 19:37:09
THE FIRE CODES THAT ARE IN 

[Captioner] 19:37:10
EFFECT, SO IT WILL BE REVIEWED 

[Captioner] 19:37:13
BY OUR BUILDING AND FIRE 

[Captioner] 19:37:13
DEPARTMENT --

[Captioner] 19:37:13
>> Councilmember Campbell: WHAT 

[Captioner] 19:37:15
ABOUT GROUNDWATER AND 

[Captioner] 19:37:17
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF HAVING 

[Captioner] 19:37:19
GASOLINE IN THE TANK?

[Captioner] 19:37:22
>> THAT'S ALSO A COMPONENT OF 

[Captioner] 19:37:23
THE REVIEW BY THE FIRE AND 

[Captioner] 19:37:24
BUILDING DEPARTMENT.

[Captioner] 19:37:25
>> Councilmember Campbell: 

[Captioner] 19:37:25
OKAY.

[Captioner] 19:37:28
AND THEN MY LAST QUESTION WOULD 

[Captioner] 19:37:30
BE ABOUT FREMONT'S TREE CANOPY 

[Captioner] 19:37:32
PROJECT THAT WE HAVE.

[Captioner] 19:37:34
WHAT IS THE IMPACT OF 

[Captioner] 19:37:36
ELIMINATING A REAL TREE AND 

[Captioner] 19:37:38
PUTTING A FAKE TREE UP THERE IN 

[Captioner] 19:37:42
TERMS OF OUR TREE CANOPY 

[Captioner] 19:37:43
REQUIREMENTS?

[Captioner] 19:37:45
>> OUR LANDSCAPE ARCHITECTURE 

[Captioner] 19:37:47
REVIEWER DID LOOK AT THIS 

[Captioner] 19:37:48
PROJECT AND DID NOT HAVE AN 

[Captioner] 19:37:50
ISSUE WITH REMOVING A SINGLE 

[Captioner] 19:37:53
EUCALYPTUS FOR THE PURPOSE OF 

[Captioner] 19:37:53
THIS.

[Captioner] 19:37:54
THERE ARE QUITE A FEW TREES IN 

[Captioner] 19:37:57
THE VICINITY, AND --

[Captioner] 19:37:58
>> Councilmember Campbell: I'M 

[Captioner] 19:37:58
SORRY, GO AHEAD.

[Captioner] 19:38:00
I HAD A FOLLOW-UP QUESTION TO 

[Captioner] 19:38:00
THAT.

[Captioner] 19:38:01
>> I'M BASICALLY DONE.

[Captioner] 19:38:02
>> Councilmember Campbell: OKAY, 

[Captioner] 19:38:03
THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 19:38:07
WOULD THE CONTRACTOR BE OPEN TO 

[Captioner] 19:38:10
PLANTING SOME OTHER TREES IN 

[Captioner] 19:38:11
REPLACEMENT FOR THE ONE THAT'S 

[Captioner] 19:38:13
COMING DOWN, MAYBE FIVE?

[Captioner] 19:38:16
>> THAT WOULD BE SUBJECT TO THE 

[Captioner] 19:38:18
APPLICANT, AS WELL AS OHLONE.

[Captioner] 19:38:19
I THINK THAT WOULD BE A GOOD 

[Captioner] 19:38:21
QUESTION FOR THE APPLICANT WHO 

[Captioner] 19:38:23
IS WITH US TONIGHT, AS WELL AS 

[Captioner] 19:38:24
IF THEY WOULD PLANT THEM AT 

[Captioner] 19:38:27
OHLONE COLLEGE, OHLONE COLLEGE 

[Captioner] 19:38:28
WOULD OBVIOUSLY HAVE TO BE OKAY 

[Captioner] 19:38:29
WITH THAT AND THEY'RE NOT 

[Captioner] 19:38:29
PRESENT.

[Captioner] 19:38:30
>> Councilmember Campbell: I 

[Captioner] 19:38:30
SEE.

[Captioner] 19:38:31
THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 19:38:31
>> Councilmember Salwan: ANY 

[Captioner] 19:38:32
OTHER QUESTIONS?

[Captioner] 19:38:35
COUNCILMEMBER COX.

[Captioner] 19:38:38
>> Councilmember Cox: THANK 

[Captioner] 19:38:38
YOU.

[Captioner] 19:38:39
THANK YOU FOR YOUR REPORT.

[Captioner] 19:38:41
I JUST HAD A CLARIFICATION FOR 

[Captioner] 19:38:44
THE RADIO FREQUENCY, THERE WAS 

[Captioner] 19:38:46
NO FOUND OF ANY TYPE OF CANCER 

[Captioner] 19:38:49
RELATED TO THE RELEASE, IF THE 

[Captioner] 19:38:52
CELL TOWER WOULD BE IN 

[Captioner] 19:38:52
OPERATION?

[Captioner] 19:38:55
>> SO THE RADIO FREQUENCY IS --

[Captioner] 19:40:12
THIS TOWER PROJECT IS A 

[Captioner] 19:40:13
COLLABORATION BETWEEN AT&T AND 

[Captioner] 19:40:14
THE OHLONE COLLEGE.

[Captioner] 19:40:17
WHILE THE CITY'S APPROVAL OF THE 

[Captioner] 19:40:19
PROJECT CERTAINLY MEETS THE 

[Captioner] 19:40:20
FINANCIAL INTEREST, PLEASE BE 

[Captioner] 19:40:22
MINDFUL THAT THIS PROJECT WILL 

[Captioner] 19:40:24
HAVE A PROFOUND AND LASTING 

[Captioner] 19:40:27
ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE PUBLIC.

[Captioner] 19:40:30
THUS WE RESPECTFULLY ASK THE 

[Captioner] 19:40:31
CITY COUNCIL TO PLEASE CONSIDER 

[Captioner] 19:40:32
THE INTEREST OF THE PUBLIC IN 

[Captioner] 19:40:32
THIS PROJECT.

[Captioner] 19:40:39
AT&T IS SEEKING TO BUILD A EIGHT 

[Captioner] 19:40:42
HE FOOT TALL CELL TOWER WITH A 

[Captioner] 19:40:45
190-GALLON FUEL TANK NEXT TO OUR 

[Captioner] 19:40:45
COMMUNITY.

[Captioner] 19:40:47
THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT FIRE 

[Captioner] 19:40:48
HAZARD AND SAFETY CONCERN FOR 

[Captioner] 19:40:48
US.

[Captioner] 19:40:50
IT WILL TAKE AWAY THE SAFE AND 

[Captioner] 19:40:52
PEACEFUL NATURE OF OUR 

[Captioner] 19:40:53
NEIGHBORHOOD, DESTROY THE 

[Captioner] 19:40:54
BEAUTIFUL AND UNIQUE 

[Captioner] 19:40:56
CHARACTERISTICS OF THE MISSION 

[Captioner] 19:40:57
SAN JOSÉ HISTORIC OVERLAY 

[Captioner] 19:40:59
DISTRICT, AND ADVERSELY AFFECT 

[Captioner] 19:41:02
THE QUALITY OF LIFE IN OUR 

[Captioner] 19:41:02
COMMUNITY.

[Captioner] 19:41:04
IT WILL ALSO CREATE A STRESSFUL 

[Captioner] 19:41:05
AND FEARFUL LIVING ENVIRONMENT 

[Captioner] 19:41:07
FOR US, BECAUSE WE ARE IN AN 

[Captioner] 19:41:09
AREA WITH FREQUENT WILDFIRES AND 

[Captioner] 19:41:10
REGULAR FIRE HAZARD WARNINGS.

[Captioner] 19:41:13
IT WILL ALSO DECREASE OUR 

[Captioner] 19:41:15
PROPERTY VALUES IN THE NEARBY 

[Captioner] 19:41:16
RESIDENTIAL COMMUNITIES.

[Captioner] 19:41:18
NEXT SLIDE, PLEASE.

[Captioner] 19:41:21
TO ADDRESS THESE PUBLIC 

[Captioner] 19:41:22
CONCERNS, WE SIMPLY ASK THAT YOU 

[Captioner] 19:41:26
IMPOSE A 1500-FOOT SETBACK AND A 

[Captioner] 19:41:27
60-FOOT HEIGHT REQUIREMENT TO 

[Captioner] 19:41:27
AT&T'S PROJECT.

[Captioner] 19:41:31
THIS IS A SIMPLE WAY TO ADDRESS 

[Captioner] 19:41:33
THE PUBLIC CONCERNS WHILE STILL 

[Captioner] 19:41:34
ALLOWING AT&T AND OHLONE COLLEGE 

[Captioner] 19:41:36
TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THE 

[Captioner] 19:41:36
PROJECT.

[Captioner] 19:41:42
TO UNDERSTAND WHY MOVING THE 

[Captioner] 19:41:43
CELL TOWER LOCATION IS 

[Captioner] 19:41:44
NECESSARY, TAKE A LOOK AT THIS 

[Captioner] 19:41:44
SLIDE.

[Captioner] 19:41:46
BOTH OUR COMMUNITY AND OHLONE 

[Captioner] 19:41:48
COLLEGE ARE IN THE MISSION SAN 

[Captioner] 19:41:49
JOSÉ HISTORIC OVERLAY DISTRICT.

[Captioner] 19:41:52
THIS IS A SPECIAL AREA WITH 

[Captioner] 19:41:54
UNIQUE HISTORICAL LANDSCAPE AND 

[Captioner] 19:41:54
ARCHITECTURES.

[Captioner] 19:41:57
THIS AREA IS HIGHLY SUSCEPTIBLE 

[Captioner] 19:41:59
TO WILDFIRES, AND IT'S 

[Captioner] 19:42:01
CATEGORIZED AS HIGH TO VERY HIGH 

[Captioner] 19:42:01
IN FIRE HAZARD.

[Captioner] 19:42:05
IN RECENT YEARS, A NUMBER OF 

[Captioner] 19:42:06
WILDFIRES AND A NUMBER OF FIRE 

[Captioner] 19:42:08
HAZARD WARNINGS AFFECTING OUR 

[Captioner] 19:42:10
NEIGHBORHOOD HAVE INCREASED 

[Captioner] 19:42:10
SUBSTANTIALLY.

[Captioner] 19:42:11
WITH THE RISING TEMPERATURE, 

[Captioner] 19:42:12
THIS PROBLEM WILL GET WORSE.

[Captioner] 19:42:15
IN FACT, ALL OF US IN THE 

[Captioner] 19:42:17
MISSION TIERRA COMMUNITY HAVE 

[Captioner] 19:42:19
BEEN ASKED TO PREPARE FOR 

[Captioner] 19:42:21
EVACUATION DUE TO THE FIRE 

[Captioner] 19:42:22
HAZARD AND THE WILDFIRE.

[Captioner] 19:42:24
IT WAS SCARY AND DEVASTATING.

[Captioner] 19:42:27
OUR FEAR AND THE FIRE SAFETY 

[Captioner] 19:42:27
CONCERN ARE REAL.

[Captioner] 19:42:33
THE AT&T CELL TOWER WILL INCLUDE

[Captioner] 19:42:34
 A 190 FUEL TANK PLACED ACROSS 

[Captioner] 19:42:35
THE PARKING LOT FROM OUR 

[Captioner] 19:42:35
NEIGHBORHOOD.

[Captioner] 19:42:37
HAVING THIS MASSIVE FUEL TANK SO 

[Captioner] 19:42:39
CLOSE TO OUR COMMUNITY IS A BAD 

[Captioner] 19:42:39
IDEA.

[Captioner] 19:42:43
ESPECIALLY IN VIEW OF THE FIRE 

[Captioner] 19:42:43
HAZARD SITUATION IN OUR AREA.

[Captioner] 19:42:50
WE ARE ALREADY FAIRLY CONCERNED 

[Captioner] 19:42:52
WITH THE NUMBER OF WILDFIRES 

[Captioner] 19:42:54
HAPPENING EACH YEAR, AND THE 

[Captioner] 19:42:55
INCREASING FREQUENCY OF THE FIRE 

[Captioner] 19:42:56
HAZARD WARNINGS.

[Captioner] 19:42:58
THE FUEL TANK WILL PLACE OUR 

[Captioner] 19:42:59
ENTIRE NEIGHBORHOOD IN 

[Captioner] 19:43:00
HEIGHTENED FEAR AND WORRIES 

[Captioner] 19:43:00
EVERY DAY.

[Captioner] 19:43:04
LOOK AT THE MASSIVE FUEL TANK 

[Captioner] 19:43:07
WILL ALSO BE IN THE CAMPUS, IN 

[Captioner] 19:43:08
VERY CLOSE PROXIMITY TO AND 

[Captioner] 19:43:10
SURROUNDED BY PEDESTRIAN 

[Captioner] 19:43:11
WALKWAYS, POLICE STATION, 

[Captioner] 19:43:14
PARKING LOT, SPORT VENUES, AND 

[Captioner] 19:43:18
WILL BE A MERE 50 FEET FROM THE 

[Captioner] 19:43:18
HALL.

[Captioner] 19:43:20
IN ADDITION TO THE MASSIVE FUEL 

[Captioner] 19:43:21
TANK, THE HEIGHT OF THE CELL 

[Captioner] 19:43:22
TOWER IS ALSO A BIG CONCERN.

[Captioner] 19:43:25
AS YOU CAN SEE HERE IN THIS 

[Captioner] 19:43:27
SLIDE, THE PHOTO TO THE RIGHT 

[Captioner] 19:43:30
SHOWS THE EXISTING LANDSCAPE AND 

[Captioner] 19:43:30
SURROUNDING ARCHITECTURE.

[Captioner] 19:43:33
THE PHOTO TO THE LEFT SHOWS THE 

[Captioner] 19:43:36
SIZE OF THE CELL TOWER WITH THE 

[Captioner] 19:43:36
GIGANTIC ENCLOSURE.

[Captioner] 19:43:41
AS YOU CAN TEE, THIS IS A

[Captioner] 19:43:42
 80-FOOT TALL VEE HIGH 

[Captioner] 19:43:44
STRUCTURE, MORE THAN TWO TIMES 

[Captioner] 19:43:46
THE HEIGHT OF THE NEARBY TREE.

[Captioner] 19:43:48
THE HEIGHT OF THE CELL TOWER 

[Captioner] 19:43:50
WILL BE A SIGNIFICANT FIRE 

[Captioner] 19:43:50
HAZARD.

[Captioner] 19:43:53
IT CAN CATCH LIGHTNING STRIKE, 

[Captioner] 19:43:53
CAUSING FIRE.

[Captioner] 19:43:55
IN FACT THE COMBINATION OF THE 

[Captioner] 19:43:58
80-FOOT TALL STRUCTURE WITH THE 

[Captioner] 19:44:00
190-GALLON FUEL TANK IS A VERY, 

[Captioner] 19:44:01
VERY BAD IDEA.

[Captioner] 19:44:05
IT IS BASICALLY A GIGANTIC

[Captioner] 19:44:06
 BOMB STICKING UP TO THE SKY.

[Captioner] 19:44:08
WE ARE AWARE THIS PROJECT HAS 

[Captioner] 19:44:09
MET VARIOUS BUILDING CODE AND 

[Captioner] 19:44:11
SAFETY PROTOCOLS, HOWEVER, THESE 

[Captioner] 19:44:12
ARE JUST THE MINIMUM 

[Captioner] 19:44:12
REQUIREMENTS.

[Captioner] 19:44:14
JUST BECAUSE THE PROJECT MEETS 

[Captioner] 19:44:15
THIS REQUIREMENT, IT DOES NOT 

[Captioner] 19:44:18
MEAN THAT THE PROJECT SHOULD BE 

[Captioner] 19:44:20
APPROVED OR A GOOD IDEA.

[Captioner] 19:44:24
APPROVAL OF A PROJECT SHOULD 

[Captioner] 19:44:25
INVOLVE A CONSIDERATION OF THE 

[Captioner] 19:44:25
TOTALITY OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES, 

[Captioner] 19:44:27
INCLUDING THE PUBLIC CONCERNS.

[Captioner] 19:44:29
AND APPLICATION OF GOOD 

[Captioner] 19:44:29
JUDGMENT.

[Captioner] 19:44:31
IN THIS CASE, MAYBE EVEN JUST A 

[Captioner] 19:44:32
LITTLE BIT OF COMMON SENSE IS 

[Captioner] 19:44:32
ALL WE NEED.

[Captioner] 19:44:35
JUST ASK YOURSELF, IS THIS 

[Captioner] 19:44:38
REALLY A GOOD IDEA TO PUT A 

[Captioner] 19:44:40
190-GALLON EXPLOSIVE WITH AN 

[Captioner] 19:44:42
80-FOOT TALL -- NEXT TO A 

[Captioner] 19:44:42
RESIDENTIAL COMMUNITY?

[Captioner] 19:44:44
AND IN THE BUSIEST PART OF THE 

[Captioner] 19:44:45
CAMPUS, SURROUNDED BY BUILDINGS 

[Captioner] 19:44:46
AND SPORT VENUES?

[Captioner] 19:44:49
ALL OF WHICH MAY I REMIND YOU 

[Captioner] 19:44:51
ARE IN A VERY HIGH FIRE HAZARD 

[Captioner] 19:44:51
AREA.

[Captioner] 19:44:55
AS YOU CAN SEE HERE, THE CELL 

[Captioner] 19:44:57
STRUCTURE WITH THIS MASSIVE 

[Captioner] 19:44:59
ENCLOSURE IS ALSO VERY INTRUSIVE 

[Captioner] 19:44:59
TO THE ENVIRONMENT SURROUNDING.

[Captioner] 19:45:02
IT BLOCKS SUNLIGHT, TAKES AWAY 

[Captioner] 19:45:03
THE SCENIC AND PEACEFUL NATURE 

[Captioner] 19:45:05
OF THE ENVIRONMENT, AND DESTROYS 

[Captioner] 19:45:06
THE OPENNESS OF THE AREA.

[Captioner] 19:45:12
THE LARGE STRUCTURE WILL BE NEXT 

[Captioner] 19:45:15
TO A PEDESTRIAN WALKWAY CREATING 

[Captioner] 19:45:17
A TUNNELING OR CLAUSTROPHOBIC 

[Captioner] 19:45:17
EFFECT.

[Captioner] 19:45:19
ANOTHER IMPORTANT REASON THAT 

[Captioner] 19:45:20
THE CELL TOWER LOCATION SHOULD 

[Captioner] 19:45:23
BE MOVED IS THAT THE SITE 

[Captioner] 19:45:25
SELECTED BY AT&T IS NOT SUITABLE 

[Captioner] 19:45:28
AT ALL UNDER SECTION 11.3 OF THE 

[Captioner] 19:45:30
HISTORIC OVERLAY DISTRICT DESIGN 

[Captioner] 19:45:30
GUIDELINE AND REGULATIONS.

[Captioner] 19:45:33
AS YOU CAN SEE HERE, SECTION 

[Captioner] 19:45:35
11.3 OF THE HO DEREG LAITION 

[Captioner] 19:45:37
SPECIFICALLY REQUIRES THE TREE 

[Captioner] 19:45:38
AT THE SITE TO BE PRESERVED.

[Captioner] 19:45:42
SECTION 11.3B EVEN GOES FURTHER 

[Captioner] 19:45:45
AND REQUIRES ANY PROJECT NEXT TO 

[Captioner] 19:45:47
SUCH A PROTECTED TREE TO 

[Captioner] 19:45:51
INCORPORATE ADDITIONAL TREES TO 

[Captioner] 19:45:52
PROTECT THE CONTINUITY OF THE 

[Captioner] 19:45:53
LANDSCAPE.

[Captioner] 19:45:55
NOTICE IT'S NOT A REPLACEMENT 

[Captioner] 19:45:57
COST, IT'S A CONTINUITY COST.

[Captioner] 19:46:01
THE PLAIN LANGUAGE IS CLEAR.

[Captioner] 19:46:02
NO REASONABLE PERSON READING 

[Captioner] 19:46:03
THIS SECTION CAN COME TO THE 

[Captioner] 19:46:07
CONCLUSION THAT THE SITE IS 

[Captioner] 19:46:08
SUITABLE BECAUSE THERE'S A TREE 

[Captioner] 19:46:10
REQUIRED TO BE PRESERVED.

[Captioner] 19:46:14
THE HISTORICAL REVIEW BOARD 

[Captioner] 19:46:15
CLEARLY DROPPED THE BOARD HERE 

[Captioner] 19:46:16
WHEN THEY RECOMMENDED THE 

[Captioner] 19:46:17
APPROVAL OF THE PROJECT.

[Captioner] 19:46:19
THE HO DEREG LAITION IS 

[Captioner] 19:46:20
IMPLEMENTED SPECIFICALLY TO 

[Captioner] 19:46:22
PROTECT HISTORIC OVERLAY 

[Captioner] 19:46:23
DISTRICT DUAL TOITY UNIQUE 

[Captioner] 19:46:24
ARCHITECTURE AND LANDSCAPE.

[Captioner] 19:46:27
IT IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE 

[Captioner] 19:46:28
LOVE OUR COMMUNITY.

[Captioner] 19:46:31
IF THE HO DEREG LAITION IS NOT 

[Captioner] 19:46:33
ENFORCED, THEN WHAT IS THE POINT 

[Captioner] 19:46:33
OF HAVING ONE?

[Captioner] 19:46:35
WHAT IS THE VALUE OF THE 

[Captioner] 19:46:37
HISTORIC OVERLAY DISTRICT IF THE 

[Captioner] 19:46:39
CITY DOESN'T BOTHER TO ENFORCE 

[Captioner] 19:46:40
THE REGULATION DESIGNED TO 

[Captioner] 19:46:40
PROTECT IT?

[Captioner] 19:46:45
SO I HOPE YOU CAN SEE NOW WHY 

[Captioner] 19:46:47
MOVING THE CELL TOWER TO ANOTHER 

[Captioner] 19:46:48
LOCATION IS NOT ONLY REASONABLE 

[Captioner] 19:46:48
BUT NECESSARY.

[Captioner] 19:46:50
AS YOU CAN SEE IN THIS MAP, 

[Captioner] 19:46:54
THERE IS OVER 1 MILLION SQUARE 

[Captioner] 19:46:56
FEET OF LAND IN THE OHLONE 

[Captioner] 19:46:58
CAMPUS THAT AT&T CAN PICK FROM.

[Captioner] 19:46:59
ANY LOCATION HERE WOULD BE 

[Captioner] 19:47:00
BETTER THAN THE CURRENT 

[Captioner] 19:47:00
LOCATION.

[Captioner] 19:47:05
NOW I'M SURE AT&T WANTS THE 

[Captioner] 19:47:08
TALLEST MOST POWERFUL CELL 

[Captioner] 19:47:09
STRUCTURE AT THE BEST LOCATION 

[Captioner] 19:47:11
IT SELECTS, BUT AT&T IS NOT 

[Captioner] 19:47:14
LEGALLY ALLOWED TO IMPLEMENT A 

[Captioner] 19:47:15
CELL STRUCTURE HOWEVER IT 

[Captioner] 19:47:15
LIKES.

[Captioner] 19:47:17
UNDER THE LEAST INTRUSIVE TEST, 

[Captioner] 19:47:21
WHICH IS THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK

[Captioner] 19:47:23
 ADOPTED, AT&T IS REQUIRED TO 

[Captioner] 19:47:23
SHOW TWO THINGS.

[Captioner] 19:47:27
NUMBER ONE, THERE IS A 

[Captioner] 19:47:27
SIGNIFICANT SERVICE GAP THAT 

[Captioner] 19:47:29
NEEDS TO BE MET, AND NUMBER TWO, 

[Captioner] 19:47:31
THE PROPOSED CELL TOWER IS THE 

[Captioner] 19:47:33
LEAST INTRUSIVE MEANS TO MEET 

[Captioner] 19:47:34
THE SERVICE GAP.

[Captioner] 19:47:36
THIS IS THE MECHANISM BY WHICH 

[Captioner] 19:47:37
THE STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT 

[Captioner] 19:47:38
CAN REGULATE HOW CELL STRUCTURES 

[Captioner] 19:47:39
CAN BE IMPLEMENTED.

[Captioner] 19:47:41
THAT MEANS AT&T CANNOT JUST PICK 

[Captioner] 19:47:42
ANY LOCATION THAT THEY LIKE.

[Captioner] 19:47:45
IT IS ANOTHER -- IF THERE'S A 

[Captioner] 19:47:47
LESS INTRUSIVE LOCATION, AT&T 

[Captioner] 19:47:49
MUST USE THE LESS INTRUSIVE 

[Captioner] 19:47:49
LOCATION.

[Captioner] 19:47:53
EVEN IF IT MAY NOT BE THEIR 

[Captioner] 19:47:53
FAVORITE LOCATION.

[Captioner] 19:47:55
IT ALSO MEANS THE DESIGN OF A 

[Captioner] 19:47:57
CELL TOWER CANNOT BE MORE 

[Captioner] 19:47:57
EXCESSIVE THAN NEEDED.

[Captioner] 19:48:01
SPEAKING OF EXCESSIVE, WE 

[Captioner] 19:48:03
DISCOVERED THAT THE AT&T CELL 

[Captioner] 19:48:05
TOWER IS ACTUALLY TALLER THAN 

[Captioner] 19:48:05
NEEDED.

[Captioner] 19:48:07
AND SO THE CITY MUST IMPOSE A 

[Captioner] 19:48:09
HEIGHT LIMIT FOR THE CELL 

[Captioner] 19:48:09
TOWER.

[Captioner] 19:48:13
REFER HERE TO THE

[Captioner] 19:48:18
 AT&T DOCUMENT, TWO LEVELS

[Captioner] 19:48:21
 OF ANTENNA.

[Captioner] 19:48:24
AT&T COULD HAVE UTILIZED THIS 

[Captioner] 19:48:26
CAPACITY HERE BACK IN THE CELL 

[Captioner] 19:48:28
STRUCTURE SHORTER BY AT LEAST 15 

[Captioner] 19:48:28
FEET.

[Captioner] 19:48:30
REMEMBER UNDER THE TEST, THE 

[Captioner] 19:48:34
LEAST INTRUSIVE TEST, TA CELL 

[Captioner] 19:48:37
TOWER CAN BE MORE INTRUSIVE THAN 

[Captioner] 19:48:37
NEEDED.

[Captioner] 19:48:40
I'M SURE AT&T WILL TELL YOU THAT 

[Captioner] 19:48:42
THE EXTRA HEIGHT IS NEEDED FOR 

[Captioner] 19:48:43
FILLING A SERVICE GAP, BUT MAKE 

[Captioner] 19:48:45
NO MISTAKE, THE EXTRA HEIGHT IS 

[Captioner] 19:48:48
ONLY THERE TO ALLOW AT&T TO MAKE 

[Captioner] 19:48:49
FUTURE REVENUE AND INCOME IN THE 

[Captioner] 19:48:49
FUTURE.

[Captioner] 19:48:52
IF THE EXTRA CAPACITY AT THE 

[Captioner] 19:48:54
LOWER ELEVATION IS GOOD FOR 

[Captioner] 19:48:59
FUTURE ANTENNA, IT CERTAINLY

[Captioner] 19:49:00
 IS GOOD ENOUGH TO MEET THE 

[Captioner] 19:49:01
SERVICE GAP NOW.

[Captioner] 19:49:03
FOR THE REASONS WE DISCUSSED, I 

[Captioner] 19:49:05
HOPE YOU CAN AGREE WITH ME THAT 

[Captioner] 19:49:08
IMPOSING A 1500 FEET SETBACK 

[Captioner] 19:49:11
FROM THE MISSION TIERRA 

[Captioner] 19:49:14
COMMUNITY IS REASONABLE AND 

[Captioner] 19:49:14
NECESSARY.

[Captioner] 19:49:15
OTHERS ALREADY DID THE SAME 

[Captioner] 19:49:15
THING.

[Captioner] 19:49:19
WE ALSO ASK THE CITY TO IMPOSE A 

[Captioner] 19:49:20
60-FOOT HEIGHT LIMIT ON THE CELL 

[Captioner] 19:49:20
TOWER.

[Captioner] 19:49:22
THIS IS A WIN-WIN SOLUTION FOR 

[Captioner] 19:49:24
ALL PARTIES BECAUSE IT IS A 

[Captioner] 19:49:25
SIMPLE WAY TO ADDRESS THE PUBLIC 

[Captioner] 19:49:26
CONCERNS WHILE STILL ALLOWING 

[Captioner] 19:49:27
THE PROJECT TO MOVE FORWARD.

[Captioner] 19:49:27
THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 19:49:35
>> Councilmember Salwan: THANK 

[Captioner] 19:49:36
YOU, MR. CHEN.

[Captioner] 19:49:38
AT THIS TIME ANY QUESTIONS FOR 

[Captioner] 19:49:39
MR. CHEN FROM THE COUNCIL 

[Captioner] 19:49:39
MEMBERS?

[Captioner] 19:49:44
COUNCILMEMBER KENG?

[Captioner] 19:49:45
>> Councilmember Keng: I HAVE 

[Captioner] 19:49:48
SOME QUESTIONS FOR MAYBE OUR 

[Captioner] 19:49:48
PLANNER?

[Captioner] 19:49:49
>> Councilmember Salwan: WE CAN 

[Captioner] 19:49:50
COME BACK TO THAT.

[Captioner] 19:49:52
ANY QUESTIONS FOR MR. CHEN AT 

[Captioner] 19:49:52
THIS POINT?

[Captioner] 19:49:54
>> Councilmember Keng: NO.

[Captioner] 19:49:54
>> Councilmember Salwan: 

[Captioner] 19:49:55
COUNCILMEMBER COX?

[Captioner] 19:49:57
>> Councilmember Cox: YES.

[Captioner] 19:50:01
THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION, 

[Captioner] 19:50:02
AND I WANTED TO FIND OUT WHAT 

[Captioner] 19:50:04
WAS YOUR REFERENCE OF MAKING IT 

[Captioner] 19:50:04
SHORTER?

[Captioner] 19:50:05
CAN YOU HEAR ME NOW?

[Captioner] 19:50:06
>> YES, I CAN.

[Captioner] 19:50:10
>> Councilmember Cox: THANK YOU 

[Captioner] 19:50:12
VERY MUCH FOR YOUR 

[Captioner] 19:50:12
PRESENTATION.

[Captioner] 19:50:13
I WANTED TO FIND OUT WHAT WAS 

[Captioner] 19:50:16
YOUR REFERENCE SOURCE OF PUTTING 

[Captioner] 19:50:21
THE TOWER 15 FEET LESS, WHICH 

[Captioner] 19:50:24
GUIDELINES WERE YOU REFERRING  

[Captioner] 19:50:24
TO?

[Captioner] 19:50:28
>> 

[Captioner] 19:50:29
 TO?

[Captioner] 19:50:32
>> MY SECOND TO THE LAST SLIDE.

[Captioner] 19:50:33
KEEP GOING.

[Captioner] 19:50:37
RIGHT THERE.

[Captioner] 19:50:38
GO BACK.

[Captioner] 19:50:45
COUNCILMEMBER COX, AS YOU CAN 

[Captioner] 19:50:48
SEE, IN AT&T'S OWN DESIGN 

[Captioner] 19:50:49
DOCUMENT HERE, THEY SHOW THIS 

[Captioner] 19:50:50
TOWER STRUCTURE HAS TWO 

[Captioner] 19:50:52
ELEVATIONS OF ANTENNA.

[Captioner] 19:50:54
THEY ARE USING ONLY THE TOP 

[Captioner] 19:50:54
ELEVATION.

[Captioner] 19:50:58
THEY WILL BE RESERVING THE

[Captioner] 19:50:59
 BOTTOM FOR ADDITIONAL ANTENNA 

[Captioner] 19:51:01
IN THE FUTURE OR OTHER CARRIER 

[Captioner] 19:51:01
POSSIBLY.

[Captioner] 19:51:03
SO THAT MEANS THEY COULD HAVE 

[Captioner] 19:51:04
USED THE LOWER ELEVATION TO MEET 

[Captioner] 19:51:05
THE SERVICE GAP.

[Captioner] 19:51:07
THEY DON'T NEED THE TWO EXTRA 

[Captioner] 19:51:08
LAYERS TO MEET ANY SERVICE GAP 

[Captioner] 19:51:09
RIGHT NOW.

[Captioner] 19:51:11
THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE TWO 

[Captioner] 19:51:12
ELEVATIONS IS 15 FEET.

[Captioner] 19:51:17
THAT'S

[Captioner] 19:51:18
 WHERE WE DREW THE REFERENCE.

[Captioner] 19:51:20
>> Councilmember Cox: WITH 

[Captioner] 19:51:21
WALNUT CREEK AND THE OTHER 

[Captioner] 19:51:22
PLACE, PALO ALTO, YOU WERE 

[Captioner] 19:51:23
SAYING THAT THEY DID THE 15 

[Captioner] 19:51:24
DIFFERENCE IN HEIGHT AS WELL?

[Captioner] 19:51:27
>> NO, THE 15 -- THEY DID THE 

[Captioner] 19:51:27
SETBACK.

[Captioner] 19:51:30
THE 1500 FEET SETBACK FROM THE 

[Captioner] 19:51:30
COMMUNITY.

[Captioner] 19:51:31
NOT JUST THE HEIGHT.

[Captioner] 19:51:33
THEY DID A SEPARATE 

[Captioner] 19:51:33
REQUIREMENT.

[Captioner] 19:51:36
THEY MAKE SURE THERE'S A 1500 

[Captioner] 19:51:38
FEET DISTANCE FROM THE NEAREST 

[Captioner] 19:51:38
RESIDENTIAL COMMUNITY.

[Captioner] 19:51:41
>> Councilmember Cox: WAS THAT 

[Captioner] 19:51:43
DISCUSSED WITH AT&T, AND WHERE 

[Captioner] 19:51:46
WAS THE PUSHBACK OF WHERE -- 

[Captioner] 19:51:50
WHERE WOULD IT BE IF YOU DID THE 

[Captioner] 19:51:50
15 FEET -- 1500 FEET PUSHBACK?

[Captioner] 19:51:52
WHERE IS THAT ON THE SLIDE?

[Captioner] 19:51:53
>> Councilmember Salwan: AT&T IS 

[Captioner] 19:51:54
COMING UP NEXT.

[Captioner] 19:51:55
>> Councilmember Cox: OH, I'M 

[Captioner] 19:51:55
SORRY.

[Captioner] 19:51:55
OKAY.

[Captioner] 19:51:57
>> WE DID NOT IMPOSE A SPECIFIC 

[Captioner] 19:51:57
LOCATION FOR THEM.

[Captioner] 19:52:00
WE JUST TELL THEM, MAKING THE 

[Captioner] 19:52:03
POINT THAT IF YOU IMPOSE A 1500 

[Captioner] 19:52:05
FEET REQUIREMENT, THERE WILL 

[Captioner] 19:52:06
STILL BE PLENTY OF LAND FOR THEM 

[Captioner] 19:52:07
TO PICK THE CELL STRUCTURE.

[Captioner] 19:52:09
SO WE ARE LETTING THEM TO PICK 

[Captioner] 19:52:11
WHATEVER THEY LIKE AS LONG AS 

[Captioner] 19:52:12
IT'S 1500 FEET AWAY FROM US.

[Captioner] 19:52:13
>> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.

[Captioner] 19:52:14
>> ALSO ONE MORE THING TO 

[Captioner] 19:52:16
ADDRESS YOUR QUESTION ABOUT THE 

[Captioner] 19:52:16
WALNUT CREEK SETBACK.

[Captioner] 19:52:19
KEEP IN MIND THE 1500 FEET 

[Captioner] 19:52:21
SETBACK IN WALNUT CREEK IS MORE 

[Captioner] 19:52:22
RESTRICTIVE THAN WHAT WE'RE 

[Captioner] 19:52:22
ASKING HERE.

[Captioner] 19:52:25
IN WALNUT CREEK, THEY REQUIRE 

[Captioner] 19:52:26
1500 FEET TO BE AWAY ONLY FROM 

[Captioner] 19:52:27
THE COMMUNITY, THE RESIDENTIAL 

[Captioner] 19:52:27
COMMUNITY.

[Captioner] 19:52:30
BUT ALSO FROM SPORT VENUE AND 

[Captioner] 19:52:30
SCHOOL.

[Captioner] 19:52:32
SO IF THIS PROJECT HAPPENED IN 

[Captioner] 19:52:33
WALNUT CREEK, THIS WOULD NEVER 

[Captioner] 19:52:34
GET APPROVED.

[Captioner] 19:52:36
>> Councilmember Cox: THANK 

[Captioner] 19:52:36
YOU.

[Captioner] 19:52:37
>> Councilmember Salwan: 

[Captioner] 19:52:38
COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL.

[Captioner] 19:52:38
>> Councilmember Campbell: I 

[Captioner] 19:52:43
JUST HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT

[Captioner] 19:52:46
 THE OVERLAY HISTORICAL 

[Captioner] 19:52:46
DISTRICT.

[Captioner] 19:52:53
IS THAT -- THOSE ARTICLES THAT 

[Captioner] 19:52:56
YOU MENTIONED, IS OHLONE COLLEGE 

[Captioner] 19:52:58
SUBJECT TO THE SAME REGULATIONS 

[Captioner] 19:53:01
THAT APPLY BECAUSE IT'S ON THEIR 

[Captioner] 19:53:02
PROPERTY?

[Captioner] 19:53:04
BECAUSE THIS IS THE OHLONE 

[Captioner] 19:53:06
COLLEGE PROPERTY, NOT YOUR 

[Captioner] 19:53:08
OVERLAY DISTRICT.

[Captioner] 19:53:09
>> COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL, 

[Captioner] 19:53:10
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY CORRECT.

[Captioner] 19:53:13
OHLONE COLLEGE IS WITHIN THE 

[Captioner] 19:53:14
HISTORIC OVERLAY DISTRICT, SO 

[Captioner] 19:53:16
THEY ARE ABSOLUTELY SUBJECT TO 

[Captioner] 19:53:19
 11.3 OF THE DESIGN GUIDELINES.

[Captioner] 19:53:20
>> Councilmember Salwan: THANK 

[Captioner] 19:53:20
YOU.

[Captioner] 19:53:22
ANY QUESTIONS FROM COUNCILMEMBER 

[Captioner] 19:53:22
KASSAN?

[Captioner] 19:53:26
>> Councilmember Kassan: NO 

[Captioner] 19:53:26
THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 19:53:30
>> Councilmember Salwan: OKAY, 

[Captioner] 19:53:30
GREAT.

[Captioner] 19:53:31
MR. CHAN, I APPRECIATE IT.

[Captioner] 19:53:33
WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO THE 

[Captioner] 19:53:35
APPLICANT, WHO IS FROM AT&T.

[Captioner] 19:53:38
WE HAVE ASHLEY SMITH, SITE 

[Captioner] 19:53:38
ACQUISITION MANAGER.

[Captioner] 19:53:41
AND YOU WILL ALSO HAVE 10 

[Captioner] 19:53:41
MINUTES.

[Captioner] 19:53:44
FOR OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT.

[Captioner] 19:53:45
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH.

[Captioner] 19:53:46
CAN EVERYONE HEAR ME?

[Captioner] 19:53:47
>> Councilmember Salwan: YES.

[Captioner] 19:53:48
>> PERFECT.

[Captioner] 19:53:50
GOOD EVENING, CITY COUNCIL.

[Captioner] 19:53:51
MY NAME IS ASHLEY SMITH.

[Captioner] 19:53:55
I'M WITH EPIC WIRELESS GROUP ON 

[Captioner] 19:53:57
BEHALF OF AT&T MOBILITY.

[Captioner] 19:54:01
FIRST I'M LIKE TO THANK SPENCER 

[Captioner] 19:54:02
SHAFS SKI AND COUNCIL FOR YOUR 

[Captioner] 19:54:03
TIME ON THIS PROJECT.

[Captioner] 19:54:06
OUR OFFICE IS PROPOSING AN 

[Captioner] 19:54:08
80-FOOT EUCALYPTUS TOWER BE 

[Captioner] 19:54:09
CONSTRUCTED TO MINIMIZE VISUAL 

[Captioner] 19:54:10
IMPACTS TO THE SURROUNDING AREA, 

[Captioner] 19:54:12
AND BETTER BLEND IN WITH THE 

[Captioner] 19:54:13
SURROUNDING VEGETATION ON THE 

[Captioner] 19:54:13
PROPERTY.

[Captioner] 19:54:15
THIS TOWER HAS BEEN DESIGNED TO 

[Captioner] 19:54:18
MEET ALL OF CALIFORNIA'S CODES 

[Captioner] 19:54:20
FOR FIRE SAFETY AND ALSO 

[Captioner] 19:54:21
BUILDING STANDARDS.

[Captioner] 19:54:23
THIS PROJECT WILL ALSO GO 

[Captioner] 19:54:25
THROUGH DSA FOR APPROVAL WITH 

[Captioner] 19:54:25
BUILDING.

[Captioner] 19:54:29
THIS PROJECT WILL BE BENEFICIAL 

[Captioner] 19:54:31
TO THE FREMONT AREA BY PROVIDING 

[Captioner] 19:54:32
THE COMMUNITY WITH A FEW 

[Captioner] 19:54:32
BENEFITS.

[Captioner] 19:54:35
THE FIRST IS BEING THE FIRST NET PROGRAM.

[Captioner] 19:54:37
THIS PROGRAM IS A SINGLE 

[Captioner] 19:54:38
NATIONWIDE NETWORK STRICTLY 

[Captioner] 19:54:41
DEDICATED TO PUBLIC SAFETY 

[Captioner] 19:54:41
COMMUNICATIONS.

[Captioner] 19:54:44
THIS NETWORK WILL ALLOW FIRST 

[Captioner] 19:54:45
RESPONDERS AND PUBLIC SAFETY 

[Captioner] 19:54:47
WORKERS TO SEND AND RECEIVE 

[Captioner] 19:54:49
VOICE, DATA AND TEXT WITHOUT 

[Captioner] 19:54:50
CONCERNS OF ANY NETWORK 

[Captioner] 19:54:50
CONGESTION.

[Captioner] 19:54:54
THE SECOND BENEFIT IS COVERAGE 

[Captioner] 19:54:54
FOR AT&T CUSTOMERS.

[Captioner] 19:54:58
THIS FACILITY WILL ALSO BE 

[Captioner] 19:54:59
CO-LOCATABLE FOR ONE FUTURE 

[Captioner] 19:55:00
CARRIER ONCE CONSTRUCTED, 

[Captioner] 19:55:03
WHETHER THAT BE T-MOBILE OR 

[Captioner] 19:55:03
VERIZON.

[Captioner] 19:55:06
APPROVAL OF THIS PROPOSED TOWER 

[Captioner] 19:55:07
IS IMPORTANT FOR PROVIDING THIS 

[Captioner] 19:55:10
AREA WITH IMPROVED PUBLIC 

[Captioner] 19:55:11
SAFETY, AS WELL AS COVERAGE AND 

[Captioner] 19:55:13
CAPACITY TO AT&T CUSTOMERS.

[Captioner] 19:55:16
ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS OR 

[Captioner] 19:55:18
COMMENTS REGARDING AT&T'S 

[Captioner] 19:55:18
PROPOSAL AT THIS TIME?

[Captioner] 19:55:20
>> Councilmember Salwan: ANY 

[Captioner] 19:55:21
QUESTIONS FROM COUNCILMEMBERS?

[Captioner] 19:55:23
COUNCILMEMBER COX, THEN 

[Captioner] 19:55:23
COUNCILMEMBER KENG.

[Captioner] 19:55:26
>> Councilmember Cox: THANK YOU 

[Captioner] 19:55:26
VERY MUCH.

[Captioner] 19:55:28
I WANTED TO FIND OUT, WAS THERE 

[Captioner] 19:55:30
ANY OPPORTUNITY TO REFLECT ON IF 

[Captioner] 19:55:35
THERE WAS THE 1500-FOOT SETBACK, 

[Captioner] 19:55:37
AND WHERE WOULD THAT BE?

[Captioner] 19:55:39
BECAUSE I'M TRYING TO VISUALLY 

[Captioner] 19:55:41
SEE IT ON THE CHART THAT HAS 

[Captioner] 19:55:42
BEEN PRESENTED SO I CAN 

[Captioner] 19:55:43
UNDERSTAND THAT.

[Captioner] 19:55:44
>> YEAH, DEFINITELY.

[Captioner] 19:55:46
SO I DO WANT TO START OFF FIRST, 

[Captioner] 19:55:50
WE DID MEET OUR CITY GUIDELINES 

[Captioner] 19:55:50
FOR SETBACKS.

[Captioner] 19:55:53
I BELIEVE THE SETBACK IS 

[Captioner] 19:55:55
100-FOOT FROM A PROPERTY LINE, 

[Captioner] 19:55:56
RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY LINE, AND 

[Captioner] 19:55:58
WE ARE ACTUALLY AT 700 FEET.

[Captioner] 19:55:59
SO WE'RE SEVEN TIMES WHAT THE 

[Captioner] 19:56:01
CITY ACTUALLY ALLOWS US TO BE.

[Captioner] 19:56:05
IN REGARDS TO THE 1500, THE 

[Captioner] 19:56:08
APPELLANT DID GIVE US TWO OTHER 

[Captioner] 19:56:09
LOCATIONS, ONE WAS A COLOCATION 

[Captioner] 19:56:12
ON EXISTING PG&E TOWER WHICH 

[Captioner] 19:56:14
WE'RE ACTUALLY ALREADY ON THAT 

[Captioner] 19:56:15
TOWER, AND THEN THE SECOND 

[Captioner] 19:56:19
LOCATION WAS THAT 1500 FEET FROM 

[Captioner] 19:56:20
THE RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY.

[Captioner] 19:56:25
WE REQUESTED FOR OUR RADIO

[Captioner] 19:56:26
 FREQUENCY ENGINEER TO COMPLETE 

[Captioner] 19:56:28
A PROPAGATION MAP OR A ZONING 

[Captioner] 19:56:30
MAP SHOWING WHAT KIND OF SERVICE 

[Captioner] 19:56:31
WOULD BE PROVIDED AGAINST WHAT 

[Captioner] 19:56:33
WAS PROPOSED AT THE CURRENT 

[Captioner] 19:56:33
LOCATION.

[Captioner] 19:56:35
AND UNFORTUNATELY THAT LOCATION 

[Captioner] 19:56:37
WOULD CAUSE INTERFERENCE TO 

[Captioner] 19:56:40
AT&T'S EQUIPMENT ON EXISTING 

[Captioner] 19:56:41
PG&E TRANSMISSION TOWER.

[Captioner] 19:56:43
SO UNFORTUNATELY THAT LOCATION 

[Captioner] 19:56:45
WOULD NOT HAVE WORKED FOR AT&T 

[Captioner] 19:56:47
AND IT WOULD BE DISRUPTIVE TO 

[Captioner] 19:56:47
SERVICES.

[Captioner] 19:56:52
>> Councilmember Salwan: 

[Captioner] 19:56:52
COUNCILMEMBER KENG.

[Captioner] 19:56:54
>> Councilmember Keng: THANK 

[Captioner] 19:56:54
YOU.

[Captioner] 19:56:56
I'M WONDERING IF YOU HAVE ANY 

[Captioner] 19:57:01
EXAMPLES OF OTHER TOWERS THAT 

[Captioner] 19:57:03
ARE -- WITH THIS SIMILAR 

[Captioner] 19:57:03
PROGRAM?

[Captioner] 19:57:06
>> SIMILAR PROGRAM AS FAR AS THE 

[Captioner] 19:57:06
HEIGHT?

[Captioner] 19:57:07
>> Councilmember Keng: THE 

[Captioner] 19:57:10
HEIGHT AND USING THE FUEL TOWER 

[Captioner] 19:57:12
AND HOW LONG HAS THAT BEEN IN 

[Captioner] 19:57:12
PRACTICE?

[Captioner] 19:57:15
>> I APOLOGIZE, ARE YOU SPEAKING 

[Captioner] 19:57:19
ON THE FUEL, THE DIESEL TANK?

[Captioner] 19:57:24
ALL AT&T PROPOSED FACILITIES AND 

[Captioner] 19:57:25
CONSTRUCTED FACILITIES CURRENTLY 

[Captioner] 19:57:29
HAVE A 30KW GENERATOR WITH 

[Captioner] 19:57:30
190-GALLON DIESEL TANK.

[Captioner] 19:57:32
THIS GENERATOR IS ONLY USED FOR 

[Captioner] 19:57:34
EMERGENCY SERVICES, SO IF FOR 

[Captioner] 19:57:36
WHATEVER REASON WE LOST PERM 

[Captioner] 19:57:40
 PERMANENT POWER FROM PG&E, THEN 

[Captioner] 19:57:41
THE GENERATOR WOULD KICK ON.

[Captioner] 19:57:43
THERE IS MAINTENANCE FOR ABOUT 

[Captioner] 19:57:44
10 MINUTES EVERY MONTH.

[Captioner] 19:57:49
IT'S ALWAYS WITHIN THE 8:00 A.M.

[Captioner] 19:57:50
 TO 5:00 P.M. BUSINESS SCHEDULE 

[Captioner] 19:57:51
AND THAT'S JUST TO MAKE SURE 

[Captioner] 19:57:53
EVERYTHING IS RUNNING 

[Captioner] 19:57:53
SUFFICIENTLY.

[Captioner] 19:57:58
>> Councilmember Keng: OKAY, 

[Captioner] 19:57:58
THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 19:57:59
>> YOU'RE WELCOME.

[Captioner] 19:58:01
>> Councilmember Salwan: 

[Captioner] 19:58:01
COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL.

[Captioner] 19:58:05
>> Councilmember Campbell: YOU 

[Captioner] 19:58:06
MENTIONED A GENERATOR?

[Captioner] 19:58:07
>> YES.

[Captioner] 19:58:07
>> Councilmember Campbell: 

[Captioner] 19:58:08
OKAY.

[Captioner] 19:58:10
AND YOU SAID THAT THE DIESEL 

[Captioner] 19:58:12
FUEL IS GOING TO BE USED AS A 

[Captioner] 19:58:14
BACKUP FOR THE GENERATOR?

[Captioner] 19:58:16
>> YEAH, THE GENERATOR RUNS OFF 

[Captioner] 19:58:18
THE DIESEL FUEL.

[Captioner] 19:58:18
>> Councilmember Campbell: THERE 

[Captioner] 19:58:21
ARE BATTERY-OPERATED 

[Captioner] 19:58:21
GENERATORS.

[Captioner] 19:58:22
IS THERE A REASON WHY YOU WOULD 

[Captioner] 19:58:25
HAVE TO USE DIESEL FUEL AND 

[Captioner] 19:58:28
CREATE A 180-GALLON TANK WHEN 

[Captioner] 19:58:31
YOU COULD USE A BATTERY TO 

[Captioner] 19:58:31
GENERATE THE --

[Captioner] 19:58:32
>> RIGHT.

[Captioner] 19:58:36
AT&T NORMALLY JUST USES THE 

[Captioner] 19:58:37
DIESEL FUEL FOR THE GENERATOR.

[Captioner] 19:58:41
I DON'T KNOW MANY OTHER SITES 

[Captioner] 19:58:42
THAT OUR OFFICE HAS BEEN WORKING 

[Captioner] 19:58:44
THAT ACTUALLY USE BATTERIES FOR 

[Captioner] 19:58:44
THE GENERATOR.

[Captioner] 19:58:47
IN THAT CASE, IF THE GENERATOR 

[Captioner] 19:58:52
WASN'T APPROVED EITHER BY OHLONE 

[Captioner] 19:58:54
COLLEGE, WHICH THEY DID APPROVE 

[Captioner] 19:58:56
THE USE OF THE DIESEL GENERATOR, 

[Captioner] 19:58:58
OR BY THE CITY, WE COULD 

[Captioner] 19:58:59
POTENTIALLY GO WITHOUT A 

[Captioner] 19:59:01
GENERATOR, BUT THAT -- YOU KNOW, 

[Captioner] 19:59:03
IF WE LOST POWER, GENERATOR 

[Captioner] 19:59:07
DOESN'T CLICK ON, THAT TOWER IS 

[Captioner] 19:59:08
NOT ON AIR ANY LONGER.

[Captioner] 19:59:09
>> Councilmember Campbell: AND 

[Captioner] 19:59:12
THERE'S ALSO SOLAR THAT'S 

[Captioner] 19:59:15
AVAILABLE TO HELP POWER IN CASE 

[Captioner] 19:59:16
THE POWER GOES DOWN.

[Captioner] 19:59:17
IS THERE A REASON WHY YOU 

[Captioner] 19:59:19
WOULDN'T USE SOLAR?

[Captioner] 19:59:22
>> SOLAR FOR A CELL FACILITY, 

[Captioner] 19:59:25
IT'S QUITE EXTENSIVE OF A 

[Captioner] 19:59:25
BUILD.

[Captioner] 19:59:27
USUALLY WE ONLY USE THOSE IF IT 

[Captioner] 19:59:29
ON A MOUNTAIN TOP OR A HILLTOP 

[Captioner] 19:59:31
WHERE POWER -- YOU KNOW, PULLING 

[Captioner] 19:59:33
PG&E FROM THE ROAD IS NOT 

[Captioner] 19:59:33
FEASIBLE.

[Captioner] 19:59:36
IT QUITE EXPENSIVE AS WELL TO 

[Captioner] 19:59:40
USE THOSE SOLAR PANELS AND IT 

[Captioner] 19:59:43
JUST NOT NECESSARILY UTILIZED ON 

[Captioner] 19:59:44
REGULAR BUILDS SUCH AS THIS ONE 

[Captioner] 19:59:46
WHERE THERE IS A PERMANENT POWER 

[Captioner] 19:59:47
SOLUTION IN THE NEARBY 

[Captioner] 19:59:47
FACILITY.

[Captioner] 19:59:48
>> Councilmember Campbell: I WAS 

[Captioner] 19:59:51
DOING SOME RESEARCH ON THIS, AND 

[Captioner] 19:59:53
THIS IS -- THESE TOWERS ARE 

[Captioner] 19:59:54
POPPING UP QUITE A BIT IN 

[Captioner] 19:59:54
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.

[Captioner] 19:59:58
AND THE RESIDENTS ARE ALSO 

[Captioner] 20:00:01
PUSHING BACK ON THE USE OF THESE 

[Captioner] 20:00:03
TYPES OF TOWERS BECAUSE THEY'RE 

[Captioner] 20:00:07
ALL OVER, THEY'RE POPPING UP ALL 

[Captioner] 20:00:09
OVER THE CITY IN L.A. COUNTY, 

[Captioner] 20:00:11
AND I WAS JUST WONDERING AGAIN 

[Captioner] 20:00:14
ABOUT THE HEIGHT, YOU KNOW, 

[Captioner] 20:00:18
FREMONT TYPICALLY HAS LOWER 

[Captioner] 20:00:18
STRUCTURES.

[Captioner] 20:00:21
WE DON'T HAVE LIKE SAN FRANCISCO 

[Captioner] 20:00:23
WHERE WE HAVE 10-STORY BUILDINGS 

[Captioner] 20:00:25
AND THAT KIND OF STUFF, SO IT 

[Captioner] 20:00:27
WOULD BE VERY OBVIOUS, 

[Captioner] 20:00:31
ESPECIALLY IN THAT AREA, THAT 

[Captioner] 20:00:34
THIS FAKE FREE -- IT WOULD 

[Captioner] 20:00:35
ACTUALLY BE THERE.

[Captioner] 20:00:38
SO IS THERE A REASON WHY IT 

[Captioner] 20:00:40
WOULDN'T BE MORE LEVELED WITH 

[Captioner] 20:00:41
THE BUILDING?

[Captioner] 20:00:41
>> YEAH, DEFINITELY.

[Captioner] 20:00:45
SO WE DID REQUEST FOR OUR RADIO 

[Captioner] 20:00:46
FREQUENCY ENGINEER TO SEE IF 

[Captioner] 20:00:47
THERE WAS A DECREASE IN THE 

[Captioner] 20:00:48
HEIGHT OF THE POWER, IF THAT 

[Captioner] 20:00:52
WOULD BE STILL BE FEASIBLE AND 

[Captioner] 20:00:53
THE REQUEST WAS TO MOVE FORWARD 

[Captioner] 20:00:54
WITH 80 FEET.

[Captioner] 20:00:56
THAT GIVES US I BELIEVE OUR 

[Captioner] 20:00:58
CENTER LINES AROUND 76-FOOT FOR 

[Captioner] 20:01:02
THE ANTENNAS, AND THAT WAS WHAT 

[Captioner] 20:01:05
SUCCESSFULLY WAS ABLE TO COVER A 

[Captioner] 20:01:07
SIGNIFICANT GAP IN THE AREA, AND 

[Captioner] 20:01:09
THE 80-FOOT WAS LEAST INTRUSIVE 

[Captioner] 20:01:10
MEANS IN ORDER TO DO SO.

[Captioner] 20:01:12
AND I DO WANT TO NOTE, TOO, I 

[Captioner] 20:01:15
DID LOOK AT OUR DRAWINGS, AND 

[Captioner] 20:01:17
THE EXISTING -- THE EUCALYPTUS 

[Captioner] 20:01:21
TREE IS 59 FEET, SO IT IS 

[Captioner] 20:01:22
APPROXIMATELY 20 FEET TALLER 

[Captioner] 20:01:23
THAN THE EXISTING TREE.

[Captioner] 20:01:26
AND THE REASON WHY WE WENT WITH 

[Captioner] 20:01:29
A EUCALYPTUS IS TO BETTER BLEND 

[Captioner] 20:01:31
IN WITH THE OTHER EUCALYPTUS ON 

[Captioner] 20:01:32
THE PROPERTY AND ALSO KIND OF 

[Captioner] 20:01:34
MIRROR WHAT WAS EXISTING AT THAT 

[Captioner] 20:01:34
LOCATION.

[Captioner] 20:01:41
>> Councilmember Salwan: DID YOU 

[Captioner] 20:01:43
WANT TO ASK ABOUT THE TREAS?

[Captioner] 20:01:43
>> Councilmember Campbell: THANK 

[Captioner] 20:01:45
YOU FOR THE REMINDER.

[Captioner] 20:01:48
WOULD YOU BE OPEN TO REPLANTING 

[Captioner] 20:01:51
SOME MORE TREES IF YOU WERE -- 

[Captioner] 20:01:52
BECAUSE IF THIS GOES THROUGH, 

[Captioner] 20:01:54
YOU WOULD HAVE TO REMOVE THAT 

[Captioner] 20:01:54
TREE.

[Captioner] 20:01:56
WOULD YOU BE OPEN TO PLANTING 

[Captioner] 20:01:58
MORE TREES IN ITS PLACE?

[Captioner] 20:01:58
>> YEAH, DEFINITELY.

[Captioner] 20:02:01
WE'VE DONE THAT BEFORE IN 

[Captioner] 20:02:02
MULTIPLE OTHER JURISDICTIONS.

[Captioner] 20:02:04
YOU REA MOVE ONE AND YOU HAVE TO 

[Captioner] 20:02:06
PLANT A COUPLE, SO AT&T WOULD 

[Captioner] 20:02:08
DEFINITELY BE OPEN TO WORKING 

[Captioner] 20:02:11
WITH ANN ARBORIST IN ORDER TO DO 

[Captioner] 20:02:11
SO.

[Captioner] 20:02:13
>> Councilmember Campbell: THANK 

[Captioner] 20:02:13
YOU.

[Captioner] 20:02:14
>> Councilmember Salwan: 

[Captioner] 20:02:15
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, ANY QUESTION?

[Captioner] 20:02:16
>> Councilmember Kassan: NO 

[Captioner] 20:02:17
THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 20:02:18
>> Councilmember Salwan: 

[Captioner] 20:02:18
THANKS.

[Captioner] 20:02:20
SO I GUESS THE TWO ISSUES THAT 

[Captioner] 20:02:22
WERE RAISED, ONE WAS THE 

[Captioner] 20:02:22
DISTANCE, THE 1500 FEET.

[Captioner] 20:02:27
THE OTHER WAS HEIGHT.

[Captioner] 20:02:28
I KNOW YOU MENTIONED THE SITE 

[Captioner] 20:02:30
THAT THE APPELLANT PICKED WAS 

[Captioner] 20:02:31
NOT A GOOD SITE.

[Captioner] 20:02:32
IS THERE ANOTHER SITE THAT YOU 

[Captioner] 20:02:35
CAN GET A WIN-WIN OUT OF THIS, 

[Captioner] 20:02:36
IS THERE ANOTHER PLACE YOU CAN 

[Captioner] 20:02:38
PUT IT THAT'S A LITTLE FURTHER 

[Captioner] 20:02:39
AWAY BUT YOU CAN STILL MAKE IT 

[Captioner] 20:02:39
WORK?

[Captioner] 20:02:42
>> IN THIS GENERAL AREA IN 

[Captioner] 20:02:45
OHLONE COLLEGE, IT'S THE BEST 

[Captioner] 20:02:46
LOCATION FOR CONSTRUCTION OF A 

[Captioner] 20:02:47
NEW WIRELESS FACILITY.

[Captioner] 20:02:50
WE WERE ORIGINALLY LOOKING NORTH 

[Captioner] 20:02:52
OF OHLONE COLLEGE, BUT THERE WAS 

[Captioner] 20:02:54
NO INTEREST BY THOSE PROPERTY OWNERS.

[Captioner] 20:02:57
AND BECAUSE OHLONE COLLEGE IS 

[Captioner] 20:02:59
MORE OF A COMMERCIAL PROPERTY, 

[Captioner] 20:03:01
WE FELT IT WAS THE BEST LOCATION 

[Captioner] 20:03:02
AND WOULD BE PREFERRED BY THE 

[Captioner] 20:03:03
COMMUNITY AS WELL.

[Captioner] 20:03:08
JUST ALREADY BEING

[Captioner] 20:03:10
 CONSTRUCTED AND WHATNOT.

[Captioner] 20:03:12
AS FAR AS THE 1500, IF WE GO ANY 

[Captioner] 20:03:15
FURTHER SOUTH, WE'D BE TOO CLOSE 

[Captioner] 20:03:17
TO THE OTHER AT&T FACILITY.

[Captioner] 20:03:20
THAT'S ON THAT PG&E TRANSMISSION 

[Captioner] 20:03:20
POWER.

[Captioner] 20:03:23
AND THAT'S WHY THAT 1500, THAT 

[Captioner] 20:03:24
LOCATION THAT THE APPELLANT HAD 

[Captioner] 20:03:27
PICKED WOULD NOT WORK.

THE HARB ORIGINAL 

[Captioner] 20:06:48

[Captioner] 20:07:08
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ALLOWING

US TO SPEAK TODAY.

[Captioner] 20:07:11
I'M A LONG TIME RESIDENT OF 

[Captioner] 20:07:13
FREMONT, HAVE BEEN HERE FOR 

[Captioner] 20:07:15
ALMOST 40 YEARS, GRADUATED FROM 

[Captioner] 20:07:15
KENNEDY HIGH SCHOOL.

[Captioner] 20:07:22
SO 11 -- THE MISSION TIERR AT 

[Captioner] 20:07:23
NEIGHBORHOOD, VERY CONCERNED 

[Captioner] 20:07:25
ABOUT THIS TOWER, IF YOU LOOK AT 

[Captioner] 20:07:28
THE PO TOWER, IT'S VERY CLOSE TO 

[Captioner] 20:07:31
THE SOCCER FIELD, THE 

[Captioner] 20:07:32
PLAYGROUNDS WHERE KIDS ARE 

[Captioner] 20:07:36
PLAYING ALL THE

[Captioner] 20:07:38
 TIME, SO IT'S RIGHT SMACK IN 

[Captioner] 20:07:39
THE MIDDLE OF ALL THAT, SO THE 

[Captioner] 20:07:42
PROXIMITY TO ALL THESE LOCATIONS 

[Captioner] 20:07:42
IS PRETTY TROUBLESOME.

[Captioner] 20:07:44
AND ALL WE'RE ASKING FOR, WE'RE 

[Captioner] 20:07:46
NOT ASKING FOR TO BE ELIMINATED, 

[Captioner] 20:07:48
WE'RE JUST ASKING FOR TO BE 

[Captioner] 20:07:50
MOVED AWAY FROM THESE POPULATION 

[Captioner] 20:07:52
CENTERS, SO HOPEFULLY YOU WILL 

[Captioner] 20:07:52
AT LEAST CONSIDER THAT.

[Captioner] 20:07:52
THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 20:08:00
>> Ms. Gauthier: AFTER YORK LIU 

[Captioner] 20:08:04
IS RAKESH GIULIANI, DAVID RAY, 

[Captioner] 20:08:05
NANCY YANG.

[Captioner] 20:08:12
>> HELLO, I AM SHOWING

[Captioner] 20:08:13
 SOME MAPS ABOUT THE QUALITY OF 

[Captioner] 20:08:14
THE GAP.

[Captioner] 20:08:17
SO THIS SHOWS -- THE CIRCLE 

[Captioner] 20:08:18
SHOWS OUR NEIGHBORHOOD --

[Captioner] 20:08:18
>> Ms. Gauthier: SIR, YOU CAN 

[Captioner] 20:08:20
PUT IT DOWN ON THE TABLE NEXT TO 

[Captioner] 20:08:22
YOU, ON THE LOWER TABLE TO YOUR 

[Captioner] 20:08:24
RIGHT UNDER THE -- FOR THE 

[Captioner] 20:08:25
DOCUMENT CAMERA, IT WILL SHOW 

[Captioner] 20:08:25
UP.

[Captioner] 20:08:27
>> OKAY.

[Captioner] 20:08:28
>> Ms. Gauthier: THE AV STAFF 

[Captioner] 20:08:29
CAN PUT IT ON THE SCREEN.

[Captioner] 20:08:29
>> ALL RIGHT.

[Captioner] 20:08:36
SORRY, CAN WE RESTART IF YOU 

[Captioner] 20:08:37
DON'T MIND?

[Captioner] 20:08:37
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

[Captioner] 20:08:38
OKAY.

[Captioner] 20:08:38
ALL RIGHT.

[Captioner] 20:08:41
SO FIRST I WANTED TO SHOW IF 

[Captioner] 20:08:42
THERE ARE QUALITY GAP.

[Captioner] 20:08:45
SO IF THAT'S TRUE, THIS IS 

[Captioner] 20:08:46
ACCORDING TO THE AT&T RESPONSE, 

[Captioner] 20:08:49
60% OF THIS REGION IS QUALITY 

[Captioner] 20:08:50
GAP, WHICH IS -- I DON'T BELIEVE 

[Captioner] 20:08:51
THAT'S THE CASE.

[Captioner] 20:08:54
THE SECOND PAGE SHOWS THAT THERE 

[Captioner] 20:08:56
ARE BETTER PLACE ALREADY -- YES, 

[Captioner] 20:08:58
ON THE RIGHT SIDE IS AT&T -- 

[Captioner] 20:08:59
WHICH IS ALREADY MUCH BETTER.

[Captioner] 20:09:02
AND THE NEXT PAGE IS THE OPTION 

[Captioner] 20:09:03
THREE, IT'S ALSO SHOWN BY AT&T 

[Captioner] 20:09:04
WHICH IS MUCH BETTER.

[Captioner] 20:09:08
AND THE NEXT ONE,

[Captioner] 20:09:11
 IT'S -- SO THERE IS THOUSAND 

[Captioner] 20:09:13
FEET ALREADY AWAY FROM THE 

[Captioner] 20:09:15
NEAREST LOCATION ON THE TOWER, 

[Captioner] 20:09:18
INTERFERENCE DOES NOT EXIST 

[Captioner] 20:09:18
BECAUSE IT MEETS THE 

[Captioner] 20:09:18
REQUIREMENT.

[Captioner] 20:09:21
THE NEXT ONE IS THE OTHER TOWERS 

[Captioner] 20:09:23
THAT -- WITHIN FREMONT, WHICH 

[Captioner] 20:09:24
SHOWS IT'S MUCH LOWER.

[Captioner] 20:09:27
THERE'S ONLY TWO TOWERS --

[Captioner] 20:09:27
>> Councilmember Salwan: ONE 

[Captioner] 20:09:27
MOMENT, SIR.

[Captioner] 20:09:29
I DON'T THINK WE CAN SEE ANY OF 

[Captioner] 20:09:29
THOSE.

[Captioner] 20:09:33
CAN STAFF GET THOSE UP?

[Captioner] 20:09:40
IS STAFF ABLE TO SEE THE 

[Captioner] 20:09:40
PRESENTATION?

[Captioner] 20:09:43
>> I HAVE A PRINTOUT, MAYBE I 

[Captioner] 20:09:45
CAN PASS TO --

[Captioner] 20:09:46
>> Councilmember Salwan: WHY 

[Captioner] 20:09:47
DON'T WE DO THAT THEN IF WE 

[Captioner] 20:09:48
CAN.

[Captioner] 20:09:48
>> RIGHT.

[Captioner] 20:09:52
THE LAST ONE IS 1500 FEET,

[Captioner] 20:09:54
 IT'S VERY FEASIBLE ON THIS 

[Captioner] 20:09:54
MAP.

[Captioner] 20:09:55
>> Councilmember Salwan: IT'S 

[Captioner] 20:09:55
WORKING NOW.

[Captioner] 20:10:01
>> MAYBE THIS ONE.

[Captioner] 20:10:01
ALL RIGHT.

[Captioner] 20:10:05
SO THIS ONE SHOWS THE CURRENT 

[Captioner] 20:10:06
AT&T MENTIONED COVERAGE GAP.

[Captioner] 20:10:08
BLUE IS COVERAGE GAP.

[Captioner] 20:10:10
THAT MEANS THAT 60% OF THE AREA 

[Captioner] 20:10:11
IS BAD, WHICH IS NOT THE CASE.

[Captioner] 20:10:19
THE SECOND ONE SHOWS ON THE LEFT

[Captioner] 20:10:20
 IS THE CURRENT ON THE RIGHT IS 

[Captioner] 20:10:22
PROPOSED LOCATIONS, THE REJECTED 

[Captioner] 20:10:24
LOCATION, WHICH OPTION ONE, THEY 

[Captioner] 20:10:25
DON'T LIKE THAT, BUT IT'S MUCH 

[Captioner] 20:10:26
BETTER ALREADY, WE CAN SEE 

[Captioner] 20:10:26
THAT.

[Captioner] 20:10:32
SAME THING FOR THE OPTION TWO, 

[Captioner] 20:10:34
WHICH THEY DON'T LIKE, THEY 

[Captioner] 20:10:35
RESPECTED, IT'S ALSO MUCH 

[Captioner] 20:10:35
BETTER.

[Captioner] 20:10:41
AND THIS ONE SHOWS THAT THE 

[Captioner] 20:10:46
NEAREST TOWER IS

[Captioner] 20:10:49
 2,000 FEET, OVER 1930 FEET 

[Captioner] 20:10:51
AWAY, WHICH -- INTERFERENCE DOES 

[Captioner] 20:10:57
NOT EXIST, OPTION 1 AND OPTION 

[Captioner] 20:10:57
2.

[Captioner] 20:10:58
THIS ONE SHOWS THE HEIGHT IS 

[Captioner] 20:10:59
MUCH LOWER FOR THE OTHER --

[Captioner] 20:11:00
>> Ms. Gauthier: SIR, THE TIME 

[Captioner] 20:11:01
REALLY IS UP NOW.

[Captioner] 20:11:04
CAN YOU GIVE US A COPY OF YOUR 

[Captioner] 20:11:06
PRESENTATION PLEASE?

[Captioner] 20:11:08
>> 15,000-FOOT RADIUS.

[Captioner] 20:11:16

[Captioner] 20:11:28

MY NAME IS RAKESH GIULIANI.

[Captioner] 20:11:34
I JUST WANT TO MENTION 80-FOOT 

[Captioner] 20:11:38
TOWER IS VERY INTRUSIVE TO THE 

[Captioner] 20:11:38
NEIGHBORHOOD.

[Captioner] 20:11:41
IT INCLUDES A HUGE FENCE 

[Captioner] 20:11:42
ENCLOSURE, 30 FEET BY 30 FEET 

[Captioner] 20:11:44
WIDE AND 15 FEET TALL, THE SIZE 

[Captioner] 20:11:46
OF THE STRUCTURE IS 

[Captioner] 20:11:48
APPROXIMATELY EIGHT MASSIVE 

[Captioner] 20:11:51
SHIPPING CONTAINERS THIS ARE IN 

[Captioner] 20:11:53
TWO LEVELS AND THIS TOWER IS 80 

[Captioner] 20:11:55
FEET TALL WITH 190-GALLON FUEL 

[Captioner] 20:11:56

[Captioner] 20:12:00
THE MASSIVE ENCLOSURE IS -- YOU

ESTHETICALLY COMPLEMENT THE 

[Captioner] 20:12:06
SURROUNDING ARCHITECTURE AND 

[Captioner] 20:12:06
BUILDINGS.

[Captioner] 20:12:10
THE TALL STRUCTURE WILL TAKE 

[Captioner] 20:12:13
AWAY THE SCENIC SURROUNDINGS.

[Captioner] 20:12:14
IT IS INTRUSIVE TO THE 

[Captioner] 20:12:14
RESIDENTS.

[Captioner] 20:12:17
CELL TOWER IS VISIBLE FROM FAR 

[Captioner] 20:12:18
DUE TO HEIGHT AND SIZE.

[Captioner] 20:12:22
ALSO THE 30-KILOWATT DIESEL 

[Captioner] 20:12:24
GENERATOR WILL BE A NUISANCE TO 

[Captioner] 20:12:25
THE PUBLIC BECAUSE IT WILL -- 

[Captioner] 20:12:25
THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 20:12:30

AT&T'S PLAN TO PLACE A CELL

MILLION DOLLARS A HOUSE IS

[Captioner] 20:14:03
190-GALLON OF FUEL BELOW THE 

[Captioner] 20:14:05
CELL TOWER, WHICH WOULD BE A 

[Captioner] 20:14:05
HUGE FIRE HAZARD.

[Captioner] 20:14:09
MISSION SAN JOSÉ IS AN I 

[Captioner] 20:14:10
IMPORTANT HISTORICAL LANDMARK 

[Captioner] 20:14:13
WITH OVER 50,000 RESIDENTS NEAR

[Captioner] 20:14:21
MANY FAMILIES HAVE BOTH YOUNG

[Captioner] 20:14:26
NEAR OHLONE COLLEGE, THERE IS 

[Captioner] 20:14:30
ALSO A COMIN

[Captioner] 20:14:34
 -- WE ALL REMEMBER IN 2020, THE 

[Captioner] 20:14:37
MISSION AREA, THE WILDFIRE, AND 

[Captioner] 20:14:40
IT REALLY HEAVILY HURT US AND WE 

[Captioner] 20:14:42
WERE SO CLOSE AND RECEIVED 

[Captioner] 20:14:46
NOTICE TO GET READY TO BE

[Captioner] 20:14:48
 EVACUATED OUR HOME.

[Captioner] 20:14:49
THE FEAR WAS SO REAL.

[Captioner] 20:14:53
SO THE 190-GALLON FUEL THAT WAS

[Captioner] 20:14:55
 STORED IS A HUGE HAZARD.

[Captioner] 20:14:58

WHAT WE ARE PROPOSING IS INSTEAD

OF THIS LOCATION OF THE PROPOSED 

[Captioner] 20:15:35
TOWER, MOVE IT ABOUT 700 FEET 

[Captioner] 20:15:38
HERE, THERE IS A HUGE AREA IN 

[Captioner] 20:15:41
THIS BOX THAT AT&T CAN PLACE 

[Captioner] 20:15:43
THEIR TOWER, AND I FIND IT HARD 

[Captioner] 20:15:46
TO BELIEVE IF THERE'S NO 

[Captioner] 20:15:50
SUITABLE AREA WITH THE SO-CALLED 

[Captioner] 20:15:51
INTERFERENCE WITH THEIR OWN 

[Captioner] 20:15:52

STILL 1600 FEET SOUTH FROM THE

[Captioner] 20:16:28
>> GOOD EVENING, CAN YOU HEAR 

[Captioner] 20:16:28
ME?

[Captioner] 20:16:32
GOOD EVENING TO FREMONT 

[Captioner] 20:16:33
COUNCILMEMBERS:  LILY MEI, 

[Captioner] 20:16:34
MAYOR, AND ALL THE 

[Captioner] 20:16:34
COUNCILMEMBERS.

[Captioner] 20:16:39
I'M SUNITA LODA,

[Captioner] 20:16:40
 PROUD CITIZEN OF USA FROM 

[Captioner] 20:16:40
FREMONT, CALIFORNIA.

[Captioner] 20:16:42
I FIND THIS IS A NUCLEAR BOMB IN 

[Captioner] 20:16:42
FREMONT.

[Captioner] 20:16:44
I FEEL IT'S A SAFETY HAZARD 

[Captioner] 20:16:47
WHERE THE LOCATION NEAR THE 

[Captioner] 20:16:50
MOUNTAINS WHICH IS FIRE HAZARD 

[Captioner] 20:16:52
MOUNTAINS, WHERE WE'VE HAD FIRE 

[Captioner] 20:16:53
PROBLEMS, EVACUATION IN FREMONT 

[Captioner] 20:16:56
AND FROM THIS AREA, AND ALSO 

[Captioner] 20:16:59
SOME SAFETY HAZARD WITH THE 

[Captioner] 20:17:00
DIESEL TANK WITH SO MUCH DIESEL 

[Captioner] 20:17:02
WHERE WE CAN HAVE SOLAR POWER.

[Captioner] 20:17:04
TECHNOLOGY TODAY, THE WHOLE 

[Captioner] 20:17:05
WORLD IS MOVING SOLAR.

[Captioner] 20:17:06
AT&T IS SUCH A BIG COMPANY, I'M 

[Captioner] 20:17:10
SURE THEY CAN AFFORD SOLAR 

[Captioner] 20:17:10
POWER.

[Captioner] 20:17:10
THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 20:17:24
>> GOOD EVENING, LADIES AND 

[Captioner] 20:17:26
GENTLEMEN, CITY COUNCIL 

[Captioner] 20:17:26
MEMBERS.

[Captioner] 20:17:28
IT IS VERY, VERY SIMPLE.

[Captioner] 20:17:30
THERE IS AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL 

[Captioner] 20:17:32
TOWERS RIGHT ON TOP OF THE 

[Captioner] 20:17:32
HILL.

[Captioner] 20:17:35
30-KILOWATT GENERATOR CAN BE 

[Captioner] 20:17:37
POWERED BY SOLAR.

[Captioner] 20:17:42
PUTTING 180-GALLON TANK, AND 

[Captioner] 20:17:45
THOSE STRUCTURES, AND DESTROYING 

[Captioner] 20:17:45
OHLONE COLLEGE.

[Captioner] 20:17:50
IT'S SOMETHING WE WHICH SHE ROUX 

[Captioner] 20:17:51
CONSIDER, THERE SHOULD BE 

[Captioner] 20:17:53
NOTHING COMMERCIAL ON THE 

[Captioner] 20:17:54
COLLEGE CAMPUS FOR A FEW 

[Captioner] 20:17:58
DOLLARS, WE ARE GOING TO DESTROY

[Captioner] 20:18:01
 FIELDS, PARKING, FALLING ON THE 

[Captioner] 20:18:02
HEADS OF THE PEOPLE.

[Captioner] 20:18:06
THEY CAN RELOCATE IT RIGHT ON 

[Captioner] 20:18:08
TOP OF THE CONTROL TOWERS.

[Captioner] 20:18:12
WHY DO THEY HAVE TO TAKE

[Captioner] 20:18:15
 OHLONE COLLEGE, BY PUTTING 

[Captioner] 20:18:16
COMMERCIAL THINGS ON OUR 

[Captioner] 20:18:16
COLLEGES.

[Captioner] 20:18:20
THEY WANT A TOWER, GIVE IT WHERE 

[Captioner] 20:18:21
IT WILL BENEFIT THE PEOPLE MORE 

[Captioner] 20:18:23
THAN IN OHLONE COLLEGE.

[Captioner] 20:18:25
AND PEOPLE HERE WHO ARE BOARD 

[Captioner] 20:18:27
MEMBERS OF OHLONE COLLEGE, THEY 

[Captioner] 20:18:28
CAN UNDERSTAND HOW IMPORTANT 

[Captioner] 20:18:29
SPACE IS.

[Captioner] 20:18:29
THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 20:18:29
[APPLAUSE]

[Captioner] 20:18:32
>> Councilmember Salwan: THANK 

[Captioner] 20:18:32
YOU.

[Captioner] 20:18:34
I THINK THAT'S THE LAST OF THE 

[Captioner] 20:18:34
SPEAKERS?

[Captioner] 20:18:35
>> Ms. Gauthier: YES, SIR.

[Captioner] 20:18:36
>> Councilmember Salwan: OKAY.

[Captioner] 20:18:37
AT THIS TIME, I WILL BE CLOSING 

[Captioner] 20:18:39
THE PUBLIC HEARING, SO WE WON'T 

[Captioner] 20:18:40
HAVE ANY FURTHER PUBLIC 

[Captioner] 20:18:41
TESTIMONY ON THIS MATTER.

[Captioner] 20:18:46
WE'LL BRING IT BACK TO THE 

[Captioner] 20:18:47
APPELLANT FOR A FIVE-MINUTE 

[Captioner] 20:18:47
REBUTTAL.

[Captioner] 20:19:07
>> COUNCIL MEMBERS, FIRST I 

[Captioner] 20:19:09
WANTED TO ADDRESS AT&T'S 

[Captioner] 20:19:09
ARGUMENT.

[Captioner] 20:19:12
THEY MENTIONED THE CELL TOWER IS 

[Captioner] 20:19:13
NEEDED BECAUSE THEY WANT TO 

[Captioner] 20:19:16
PROVIDE PUBLIC SAFETY AND 

[Captioner] 20:19:16
RESPONDER COMMUNICATION.

[Captioner] 20:19:19
KEEP IN MIND WE ARE NOT OPPOSED 

[Captioner] 20:19:19
TO THAT.

[Captioner] 20:19:23
WE ACTUALLY RECOMMENDING -- IT 

[Captioner] 20:19:24
WILL STILL SERVE THEIR PURPOSE.

[Captioner] 20:19:26
WEAR NOT SAYING DON'T DO IT, BUT 

[Captioner] 20:19:27
DO IT IN A SAFER PLACE.

[Captioner] 20:19:29
SECOND OF ALL, THEY ALSO 

[Captioner] 20:19:33
MENTIONED THE CELL TOWER MET THE 

[Captioner] 20:19:35
100-FOOT SETBACK ALREADY 

[Captioner] 20:19:35
REQUIRED BY THE CODE.

[Captioner] 20:19:39
AGAIN, THE CODE IS A MUN MUM 

[Captioner] 20:19:40
REQUIREMENT, IT DOESN'T REPLACE 

[Captioner] 20:19:40
GOOD JUDGMENT.

[Captioner] 20:19:45
IN THIS CASE 100-FOOT IS WAY TOO 

[Captioner] 20:19:45
LITTLE.

[Captioner] 20:19:47
I WANTED TO CORRECT, AT THAT 

[Captioner] 20:19:51
 AT&T MENTIONED THE HEIGHT OF 

[Captioner] 20:19:55
THE CURRENT TREE IS 60 OR

[Captioner] 20:19:56
 50-FOOT, WHICH IS NOT THE 

[Captioner] 20:19:56
CASE.

[Captioner] 20:19:59
THE CAR ON THE LOWER LEFT IS 

[Captioner] 20:20:02
ROUGHLY ABOUT 6 FEET TALL.

[Captioner] 20:20:05
YOU CAN TELL THE TREE IS NOT 10 

[Captioner] 20:20:06
TIMES THE HEIGHT OF THE CAR.

[Captioner] 20:20:08
THAT TREE IS CURRENTLY ASSISTING 

[Captioner] 20:20:10
AT THE SITE, IT'S ROUGHLY ABOUT 

[Captioner] 20:20:10
24 FEET.

[Captioner] 20:20:16
NOW, AT&T KEEP MENTIONING THAT 

[Captioner] 20:20:18
THE LOCATION WE PROPOSE, THAT WE 

[Captioner] 20:20:19
PROPOSE, WON'T WORK FOR THEM.

[Captioner] 20:20:22
KEEP IN MIND, THE LOCATION WE 

[Captioner] 20:20:24
BROUGHT UP ARE NOT WHAT WE WANT 

[Captioner] 20:20:27
THEM TO DO, SET SOME EXAMPLE OF 

[Captioner] 20:20:28
WHAT THEY COULD DO.

[Captioner] 20:20:31
THEY HAVE A LOT OF OPTIONS IN 

[Captioner] 20:20:32
THAT 1 MILLION SQUARE FEET OF 

[Captioner] 20:20:32
LAND.

[Captioner] 20:20:41
AT&T MENTIONED THERE IS 

[Captioner] 20:20:43
INTERFERENCE WITH THEIR 

[Captioner] 20:20:45
EQUIPMENT IF WE MOVED THE POWER 

[Captioner] 20:20:51
FURTHER TO THE THIS BLACK

[Captioner] 20:20:54
 LINE RIGHT HERE.

[Captioner] 20:20:57
NOWHERE NEAR THE LAND TO THE 

[Captioner] 20:20:57
NORTH.

[Captioner] 20:21:01
IN OTHER WORDS, EVEN IF THEY 

[Captioner] 20:21:04
MOVE THE TOWER FOR THE SOUTH, IT 

[Captioner] 20:21:06
SHOULD NOT INTERFERE WITH THEIR 

[Captioner] 20:21:07
EQUIPMENT ALONG THAT LINE.

[Captioner] 20:21:09
NOW AT&T WILL TELL YOU ANYTHING 

[Captioner] 20:21:11
THEY WANT TO SAY TO CONVINCE 

[Captioner] 20:21:13
YOU, THEY CANNOT MOVE THEIR 

[Captioner] 20:21:14
CURRENT LOCATION.

[Captioner] 20:21:17
THAT'S BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY 

[Captioner] 20:21:21
LOCATION THEY'VE LIKE -- WE ARE 

[Captioner] 20:21:22
NOT THE ONES THAT HAVE BEEN 

[Captioner] 20:21:24
INFLECTIONIBLE, WE'RE THE ONES 

[Captioner] 20:21:29
TO SAY GO AHEAD, PICK A

[Captioner] 20:21:30
 SAFER PLACE AND A BETTER 

[Captioner] 20:21:30
LOCATION.

[Captioner] 20:21:32
NOW AT THIS POINT I WANT YOU TO 

[Captioner] 20:21:36
URGE YOUR CITY TO DO

[Captioner] 20:21:37
 STRATEGICALLY WHEN CONSIDERING 

[Captioner] 20:21:38
THIS TYPE OF PROJECT.

[Captioner] 20:21:42
DON'T GRANT THEM WITH EASE OR 

[Captioner] 20:21:42
WITH HASTE.

[Captioner] 20:21:45
KEEP IN MIND, THE FEDERAL LAW 

[Captioner] 20:21:51
ACTUALLY REQUIRES NOT TO

[Captioner] 20:21:53
 DISKRIM NAIL BETWEEN CARRIERS.

[Captioner] 20:21:57
IF YOU APPROVE THIS ONE TOWER 

[Captioner] 20:21:59
PROJECT, YOU OPEN UP THE 

[Captioner] 20:22:00
FLOODGATE OF INVITING OTHER 

[Captioner] 20:22:01
CARRIERS TO COME INTO OUR 

[Captioner] 20:22:01
NEIGHBORHOOD.

[Captioner] 20:22:06
SO DON'T LET A

[Captioner] 20:22:07
 ONE-TIME CELL TOWER PROJECT, 

[Captioner] 20:22:13
ATEUMING THIS ONE -- CAN SELL -- 

[Captioner] 20:22:15
ALSO IT CAN CERTAINLY INCREASE 

[Captioner] 20:22:19
THE NUMBER OF FUTURE LOSSES.

[Captioner] 20:22:23
UNDER THE ANTIDISCRIMINATION

[Captioner] 20:22:24
 OF FEDERAL LAW.

[Captioner] 20:22:24
THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 20:22:25
[APPLAUSE]

[Captioner] 20:22:34
>> Councilmember Salwan: ARE 

[Captioner] 20:22:35
THERE ANY QUESTIONS FOR THE 

[Captioner] 20:22:36
APPELLANT FROM COUNCILMEMBERS?

[Captioner] 20:22:38
NO?

[Captioner] 20:22:38
OKAY.

[Captioner] 20:22:41
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, ANY 

[Captioner] 20:22:41
QUESTION?

[Captioner] 20:22:42
>> Councilmember Kassan: NO 

[Captioner] 20:22:42
THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 20:22:44
>> Councilmember Salwan: OKAY, 

[Captioner] 20:22:45
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

[Captioner] 20:22:47
WE'LL BRING IT BACK TO AT&T.

[Captioner] 20:22:49
THE APPLICANT, FOR THEIR 

[Captioner] 20:22:49
REBUTTAL.

[Captioner] 20:22:50
THEY WILL ALSO HAVE FIVE 

[Captioner] 20:22:50
MINUTE.

[Captioner] 20:22:57
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH.

[Captioner] 20:22:58
ARE YOU ABLE TO HEAR ME?

[Captioner] 20:22:59
>> Councilmember Salwan: YES, 

[Captioner] 20:22:59
MA'AM.

[Captioner] 20:23:00
>> PERFECT, THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 20:23:03
I APPRECIATE EVERYONE COMING OUT 

[Captioner] 20:23:05
WITH THEIR CONCERNS AND COMMENTS 

[Captioner] 20:23:06
REGARDING THE PROJECT.

[Captioner] 20:23:11
IN REGARD TO THE PUBLIC

[Captioner] 20:23:13
 SAFETY -- THE PROJECT FELL 

[Captioner] 20:23:17
UNDER THE FCC GUIDELINES, SO

[Captioner] 20:23:21
 WE ARE APPROVED AS FAR AS THE 

[Captioner] 20:23:23
FEDERAL COMMISSION'S ACT HAS US 

[Captioner] 20:23:26
AS FAR AS THE EME, AND THEN IN 

[Captioner] 20:23:28
REGARDS TO THE GENERATOR, IF 

[Captioner] 20:23:30
THERE IS A LARGE CONCERN, WE CAN 

[Captioner] 20:23:34
REQUEST TO DO A NO-GENERATOR 

[Captioner] 20:23:35
PROJECT, WHICH IS A REMOVAL OF 

[Captioner] 20:23:39
THE GENERATOR AND THE 190-GALLON 

[Captioner] 20:23:40
TANK, AND INSTEAD IT WOULD JUST 

[Captioner] 20:23:42
RUN OFF PERMANENT POWER.

[Captioner] 20:23:44
THAT IS AN OPTION.

[Captioner] 20:23:49
IF THE CITY PREFERS FOR US TO

[Captioner] 20:23:51
 MOVE SO THERE IS AN OPTION 

[Captioner] 20:23:51
THERE FOR THAT.

[Captioner] 20:23:54
IN REGARDS TO THE HEIGHT OF THE 

[Captioner] 20:23:57
TOWER, I DO HAVE A FEW PHOTO 

[Captioner] 20:24:00
SIMULATIONS THAT DO SHOW WHAT IS 

[Captioner] 20:24:03
EXISTING AND WHAT IS PROPOSED.

[Captioner] 20:24:07
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE ABLE TO 

[Captioner] 20:24:08
SEE THIS.

[Captioner] 20:24:12
THIS IS THE EXISTING HEIGHT OF 

[Captioner] 20:24:14
THE TREE, AND THEN THIS IS WHAT 

[Captioner] 20:24:15
THE PROPOSAL IS.

[Captioner] 20:24:21
AND PER OUR SURVEY THAT WAS 

[Captioner] 20:24:23
CONDUCTED, THE ELEVATION OF THE 

[Captioner] 20:24:26
TREE IS ABOUT 440 AND THE 

[Captioner] 20:24:29
ELEVATION OF THE GROUND CONTOUR 

[Captioner] 20:24:32
IS 381, SO THAT'S WHERE WE GOT 

[Captioner] 20:24:34
THE 59-FOOT EXISTING HEIGHT OF 

[Captioner] 20:24:34
THE TREE.

[Captioner] 20:24:42
THE DEPICTION OF THE PROPOSED 

[Captioner] 20:24:43
TOWER AS WELL.

[Captioner] 20:24:45
AND THEN AS YOU CAN TELL FROM 

[Captioner] 20:24:48
THIS ONE, THE EXISTING AND THE 

[Captioner] 20:24:50
PROPOSED, THE TREE FROM THIS 

[Captioner] 20:24:53
AREA ACTUALLY APPEARS TO BE THE 

[Captioner] 20:24:55
SAME HEIGHT AS WHAT IS IN THE 

[Captioner] 20:24:55
SURROUNDING AREA.

[Captioner] 20:24:58
ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS 

[Captioner] 20:25:00
FOR THE APPLICANT?

[Captioner] 20:25:02
>> Councilmember Salwan: 

[Captioner] 20:25:02
COUNCILMEMBER COX.

[Captioner] 20:25:07
>> Councilmember Cox: THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 20:25:09
I WOULD LIKE TO FIND OUT 

[Captioner] 20:25:10
GENERALLY WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT 

[Captioner] 20:25:14
THESE TYPE OF SITES, YOU HAVE

[Captioner] 20:25:18
 OTHER SITES -- WHAT'S GENERATED 

[Captioner] 20:25:21
AS, SAY, I GUESS A POWER SOURCE, 

[Captioner] 20:25:22
TO BE ABLE TO CLOSE THE GAP ON 

[Captioner] 20:25:25
THE SERVICE SO THAT OUR CALLS 

[Captioner] 20:25:26
DON'T DROP USING OUR CELL 

[Captioner] 20:25:26
PHONE.

[Captioner] 20:25:31
AND CONSIDERING THAT WITH OHLONE 

[Captioner] 20:25:32
HAVING A LOT MORE ACRES, WHERE 

[Captioner] 20:25:37
WERE SOME OTHER ACRES THAT YOU

[Captioner] 20:25:40
 SAID THEY WERE INTERFERING WITH 

[Captioner] 20:25:42
THE OTHER TOWER FREQUENCIES, BUT 

[Captioner] 20:25:46
THERE'S GOT TO BE SOME OTHER 

[Captioner] 20:25:50
APTIONS OF LOOKING

[Captioner] 20:25:53
 AT -- EVEN GOING TO THE EAST 

[Captioner] 20:25:54
BAY REGIONAL PARK, THERE'S SOME 

[Captioner] 20:25:58
AREAS THERE, SO I WANTED TO HEAR 

[Captioner] 20:26:01
SOME OF YOUR OTHER OPS AND WHAT 

[Captioner] 20:26:03
WOULD BE CONSIDERED LIKE YOUR 

[Captioner] 20:26:07
NEXT BEST OR SECOND OR THIRD

[Captioner] 20:26:11
.

[Captioner] 20:26:13
>> THOSE WERE NOT DEEMED 

[Captioner] 20:26:13
FEASIBLE FOR AT&T.

[Captioner] 20:26:16
THEY WOULD NOT MOVE FORWARD WITH 

[Captioner] 20:26:18
THOSE TWO LOCATIONS, THE ONE 

[Captioner] 20:26:20
THAT'S 1500 FEET FROM MISSION 

[Captioner] 20:26:22
TIERRA AND THEN THE OTHER ONE 

[Captioner] 20:26:23
THAT'S THE PG&E TRANSMISSION 

[Captioner] 20:26:24
TOWER.

[Captioner] 20:26:26
THERE WAS A SECONDARY LOCATION 

[Captioner] 20:26:30
THAT AT&T DID REVIEW ON OHLONE

[Captioner] 20:26:36
 COLLEGE, AND TO THE EAST

[Captioner] 20:26:40
 OF EXISTING

[Captioner] 20:26:41
 TOWER LOCATION ON THE HILLTOP, 

[Captioner] 20:26:44
IT WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO CLOSE 

[Captioner] 20:26:50
THE SIGNIFICANT KNOWLEDGE

[Captioner] 20:26:54
 BADGE ARE THE EXISTING -- OR 

[Captioner] 20:26:55
PROPOSED PO KER LOCATION.

[Captioner] 20:26:58
SO THE PREFERENCE FOR AT&T TO 

[Captioner] 20:26:59
CLOSE THE SERVICE GAP OFF OF 

[Captioner] 20:27:02
MISSION BOULEVARD AND MISSION 

[Captioner] 20:27:03
TIERRA IS TO CONSTRUCT THE TOWER 

[Captioner] 20:27:05
AT THE LOCATION THAT IT'S AT 

[Captioner] 20:27:05
CURRENTLY.

[Captioner] 20:27:06
>> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.

[Captioner] 20:27:10
I DO LIKE THE IDEA OF NOT HAVING 

[Captioner] 20:27:12
A GENERATOR AND I KNOW THERE'S A 

[Captioner] 20:27:13
RESPONSIBILITY OF IF YOU EVER 

[Captioner] 20:27:15
HAVE FUEL TANKS, YOU HAVE TO 

[Captioner] 20:27:17
ALWAYS KEEP THOSE LEAK TEST DONE 

[Captioner] 20:27:21
ON A REGULAR MAINTENANCE 

[Captioner] 20:27:23
SERVICES ARRANGEMENT, SINCE 

[Captioner] 20:27:27
WE'RE VERY GREEN AND -- IT WOULD 

[Captioner] 20:27:29
MAKE SENSE NOT TO HAVE A 

[Captioner] 20:27:32
GENERATOR AND THE FUEL TANK 

[Captioner] 20:27:33
RIGHT THERE, AND WE WOULD JUST 

[Captioner] 20:27:36
BE DEPENDENT ON THE POWER BY 

[Captioner] 20:27:37
ITSELF, I THINK TO ELIMINATE 

[Captioner] 20:27:37
THAT.

[Captioner] 20:27:39
I STILL HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT 

[Captioner] 20:27:39
THE LOCATION.

[Captioner] 20:27:44
I'M NOT TOTALLY SATISFIED WITH 

[Captioner] 20:27:48
ALL THE AREAS AND ALL OF THE 

[Captioner] 20:27:50
LAND -- I SERVED 12 YEARS ON THE 

[Captioner] 20:27:51
OHLONE COLLEGE TRUSTEE BOARD AND 

[Captioner] 20:27:56
WE HAVE A LOT OF RAND

[Captioner] 20:28:00
 LAND THAT COULD COULD MOVE AWAY

[Captioner] 20:28:02
 FOR OUR OWN SAFETY BUT I DON'T 

[Captioner] 20:28:04
REALLY SEE A LOT OF THE 

[Captioner] 20:28:05
ENGINEERING REPORT SAYING THAT 

[Captioner] 20:28:07
YOU HAD TO HAVE CHECKED 20 

[Captioner] 20:28:10
DIFFERENT SPOTS, HOT SPOTS, TO 

[Captioner] 20:28:11
FIND ONE THAT WOULD HAVE -- YOU 

[Captioner] 20:28:12
KNOW, YOU HAVE THAT ONE BUT 

[Captioner] 20:28:15
WHAT'S THE OTHER TWO OR THREE, 

[Captioner] 20:28:19
AND TO COME BACK AND ONLY SAY 

[Captioner] 20:28:21
TWO, THAT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE WE 

[Captioner] 20:28:24
DID A LOT MORE EXPLORATORY WORK 

[Captioner] 20:28:25
TO DISCOVER IF THERE'S SOME 

[Captioner] 20:28:26
OTHER OPTIONS FOR THAT.

[Captioner] 20:28:30
SO MY CONCERN IS THAT I'D LIKE 

[Captioner] 20:28:32
TO HAVE SEEN MORE ON DUE DILL 

[Captioner] 20:28:35
JESS ON THE PART OF AT&T TO HAVE 

[Captioner] 20:28:37
PRESENTED SOME ADDITIONAL OPTION 

[Captioner] 20:28:39
SITES BESIDES WHAT WAS PRESENTED 

[Captioner] 20:28:39
HERE.

[Captioner] 20:28:42
>> AND I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND 

[Captioner] 20:28:42
THAT.

[Captioner] 20:28:45
ONE OF OUR -- AS A VENDOR FOR 

[Captioner] 20:28:46
AT&T, WE WORK ON BEHALF OF AT&T 

[Captioner] 20:28:48
BUT WE ALSO WORK WITH THE 

[Captioner] 20:28:49
LANDLORD, WHICH IS OHLONE 

[Captioner] 20:28:51
COLLEGE, SO THEY OFFER LOCATIONS 

[Captioner] 20:28:55
FOR US AND AT THE TIME OF THE 

[Captioner] 20:28:56
SITE DESIGN WALK, THERE WAS ONLY 

[Captioner] 20:28:58
THE TWO LOCATIONS THAT THEY 

[Captioner] 20:29:00
PREFERRED FOR US TO LEASE FROM 

[Captioner] 20:29:00
THEM.

[Captioner] 20:29:04
>> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.

[Captioner] 20:29:06
>> IF YOU DON'T HAVE A WILLING 

[Captioner] 20:29:08
LANDLORD FOR A SPECIFIC 

[Captioner] 20:29:10
LOCATION, THEN YOU CAN'T 

[Captioner] 20:29:10
CONSTRUCT AT THAT LOCATION.

[Captioner] 20:29:12
>> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.

[Captioner] 20:29:14
I WAS GOING TO ASK A QUESTION 

[Captioner] 20:29:16
TOO, I'LL FINISH WITH AT&T AND 

[Captioner] 20:29:18
THEN I WAS GOING TO GO BACK TO 

[Captioner] 20:29:19
OUR CITY STAFF AFTER THAT.

[Captioner] 20:29:34
>> Councilmember Salwan: I SEE 

[Captioner] 20:29:35
COUNCILMEMBER KENG HAS A 

[Captioner] 20:29:35
QUESTION.

[Captioner] 20:29:36
I DON'T KNOW IF COUNCILMEMBER 

[Captioner] 20:29:37
KASSAN HAS A QUESTION.

[Captioner] 20:29:39
>> Councilmember Keng: YES, SO I 

[Captioner] 20:29:42
WOULD ALSO LIKE TO SEE MORE 

[Captioner] 20:29:46
EXPLORATORY SITES, POTENTIAL -- 

[Captioner] 20:29:47
BECAUSE THE LAND IS LARGE AND IF 

[Captioner] 20:29:49
WE ARE ABLE TO FIND ANYWHERE 

[Captioner] 20:29:52
THAT'S A LITTLE BIT BACK AWAY 

[Captioner] 20:29:54
FROM THE COMMUNITY, I THINK THAT 

[Captioner] 20:29:58
WOULD MAKE IT A BET FOR THEM

[Captioner] 20:30:07
>> Councilmember Salwan:   AND 

[Captioner] 20:30:09
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN.

[Captioner] 20:30:11
ANY QUESTIONS FROM YOU?

[Captioner] 20:30:12
>> Councilmember Kassan:   

[Captioner] 20:30:13
NOTICE THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 20:30:14
>> Councilmember Salwan:   YOU 

[Captioner] 20:30:15
OR WILLING TOE REPLACE THE 

[Captioner] 20:30:18
GENERATOR AND REPLACING WITH --

[Captioner] 20:30:20
>> WE HAVE PERMANENT POWER TO 

[Captioner] 20:30:21
THE PROPOSED FACILITY.

[Captioner] 20:30:24
WE WOULD JUST GET RID OF THE 

[Captioner] 20:30:26
GENERATOR AND THE TANK.

[Captioner] 20:30:27
THAT'S ATTACHED.

[Captioner] 20:30:29
>> Councilmember Salwan:   YEAH, 

[Captioner] 20:30:30
OKLAHOMA, THAT COULD BE A 

[Captioner] 20:30:32
CONDITION OF APPROVAL IF THE 

[Captioner] 20:30:36
COUNCIL DISIERS

[Captioner] 20:30:37
.

[Captioner] 20:30:39
THANK YOU SO MUCH WE'LL BRING IT 

[Captioner] 20:30:42
BACK TOTE COUNCIL.

[Captioner] 20:30:44
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY, 

[Captioner] 20:30:48
IT'S VERY HEX TO HEAR FROM 

[Captioner] 20:30:49
EVERYONE.

[Captioner] 20:30:50
QUESTIONS OF STAFF.

[Captioner] 20:30:53
I THINK THERE WERE CONCERNS 

[Captioner] 20:30:55
RAISE OWED ABOUT THE FUEL CELL, 

[Captioner] 20:30:56
THAT'S BEEN RESOLVED.

[Captioner] 20:30:59
AS FAR AS THE HEIGHT, 60 FEET 

[Captioner] 20:31:01
VERSUS 80 FEET AND THEN THE 

[Captioner] 20:31:03
CONCERN ABOUT THE HISTORIC 

[Captioner] 20:31:04
GUIDELINES ABOUT THE TREES.

[Captioner] 20:31:10
>> THANK YOU SO AGAIN FOR THE 

[Captioner] 20:31:11
HEIGHT THAT IS DETERMINED BY THE 

[Captioner] 20:31:12
CARRIER.

[Captioner] 20:31:14
WE DO REQUIRE THAT THEY PROVIDE 

[Captioner] 20:31:18
THE ABILITY TO CO-LOW CAKE FOR 

[Captioner] 20:31:18
ADDITIONAL OCCASION IN THE 

[Captioner] 20:31:19
FUTURE.

[Captioner] 20:31:24
THAT WILL HELP MULTIPLE

[Captioner] 20:31:25
 FUTURE 

[Captioner] 20:31:27
FACILITIES, ONE INSTEAD OF 

[Captioner] 20:31:27
SEVERAL.

[Captioner] 20:31:29
THAT IS IN OUR CODE WE DOUGH 

[Captioner] 20:31:32
WANT TO REQUIRE A CO-LOCATION.

[Captioner] 20:31:36
IF IT IS 60 FEET THEY MAY NOT BE

[Captioner] 20:31:37
 

[Captioner] 20:31:38
ABILITY TO CO-LOCATE.

[Captioner] 20:31:41
THAT IS WHY WE TRIED THE 

[Captioner] 20:31:43
CO-LOCATION, THEY DO PROVIDE 

[Captioner] 20:31:44
THAT 80 FEET IS WHAT THEY WOULD 

[Captioner] 20:31:46
REQUIRE TO MEET THEIR COANCH 

[Captioner] 20:31:46
GOALS.

[Captioner] 20:31:50
>> I CAN SPEAK TO THE TREE 

[Captioner] 20:31:51
QUESTION.

[Captioner] 20:31:53
SO THE HISTORIC ARCHITECTURAL 

[Captioner] 20:31:56
REVIEW BOARD'S PRIMARILY REASON 

[Captioner] 20:31:58
FOR EXISTING IN A PROJECT LIKE 

[Captioner] 20:32:00
THIS, IS TOE REVIEW POTENTIALLY 

[Captioner] 20:32:02
ELIGIBLE HISTORIC RESOURCES AND 

[Captioner] 20:32:04
ADVISE IF THERE IS ANY IMPACT ON 

[Captioner] 20:32:04
THOSE RESOURCES.

[Captioner] 20:32:08
SECTION 11.3 SPEAKS PRIMARILY TO 

[Captioner] 20:32:13
HERITAGE TREES AND TREES OVER 18

[Captioner] 20:32:13
 

[Captioner] 20:32:14
INCHES.

[Captioner] 20:32:15
THOSE GUIDELINES WERE CREATED IN 

[Captioner] 20:32:17
1998 AND THEY TALK A LOT ABOUT 

[Captioner] 20:32:20
THE OLIVES FOR EXAMPLE ALONG 

[Captioner] 20:32:22
MISSION BOULEVARD AND THE SPINE 

[Captioner] 20:32:25
OF THE COLLEGE ENTRY, THAT GO 

[Captioner] 20:32:26
ALONG MISSION BOULEVARD TO THE 

[Captioner] 20:32:29
COLLEGE AND OTHER STANCE AND 

[Captioner] 20:32:30
TREES WITHIN THE MISSION SAN 

[Captioner] 20:32:32
JOSE HISTORIC CONTEXT.

[Captioner] 20:32:35
SO WHILE IT TALKS ABOUT TREES 

[Captioner] 20:32:37
OVER 18 INCHES IT IS NOT A THAT 

[Captioner] 20:32:39
THE OUT PROHIBITION IS NOTE.

[Captioner] 20:32:42
AND THIS ONE LOAN EUCALYPTUS 

[Captioner] 20:32:44
WITHIN THE CAMPUS ENVIRONMENT 

[Captioner] 20:32:46
AND THOUGHT ONE OF THE STANDS OF 

[Captioner] 20:32:49
TREES THAT WERE PRIMARILY TO BE 

[Captioner] 20:32:51
PRESERVED BY HARB.

[Captioner] 20:32:53
>> Councilmember Salwan:   I 

[Captioner] 20:32:55
THINK THERE WAS CONCERN ABOUT 

[Captioner] 20:32:58
THE DISTANCE, 1500 FEET, 

[Captioner] 20:33:00
ALTERNATIVE SITES, IS THERE ANY 

[Captioner] 20:33:01
FEEDBACK ON THAT?

[Captioner] 20:33:02
>> Planner Pullen:   LET ME 

[Captioner] 20:33:03
SPEAK TO THAT.

[Captioner] 20:33:07
OUR CODE IS VERY MINIMAL RESPECT 

[Captioner] 20:33:08
TOE SETBACKS.

[Captioner] 20:33:10
1500 FEET RIGHT AT THAT LIMIT OR 

[Captioner] 20:33:12
SOMETIMES WHEN THE FCC RULES 

[Captioner] 20:33:16
DEMANDED IT

[Captioner] 20:33:18
, LESS THAN THAT 

[Captioner] 20:33:19
LIMIT IN ORDER TOE PROVIDE THE 

[Captioner] 20:33:22
ABILITY TO CREATE CELL COVERAGE 

[Captioner] 20:33:24
WHEN IT DID CHALLENGED.

[Captioner] 20:33:26
SOMETIMES UNDER FCC RULES WE 

[Captioner] 20:33:28
HAVE TOE GO UNDER 1500 FEET TO 

[Captioner] 20:33:30
MAKE IT FEASIBLE.

[Captioner] 20:33:33
WE HAVE 700 WHICH IS QUITE 

[Captioner] 20:33:34
SUBSTANTIAL RELATIVE TO OUR CITY 

[Captioner] 20:33:34
STANDARD.

[Captioner] 20:33:36
AND SO THERE'S NOT A STAFF 

[Captioner] 20:33:38
CONCERN WITH RESPECT TO THAT -- 

[Captioner] 20:33:39
WITH THAT GENEROUS SET BACK.

[Captioner] 20:33:42
ALSO, THE CO-LOCATION THAT 

[Captioner] 20:33:44
SPENCER WENT THROUGH THAT 

[Captioner] 20:33:46
COMMENT IS CORRECT AND I WOULD 

[Captioner] 20:33:49
POINT YOU BACK TO THE 

[Captioner] 20:33:52
SIGNIFICANT GAPS SHOWN ON THE 

[Captioner] 20:33:55
MAP, THIS LOCATION IS INTENDED 

[Captioner] 20:33:58
GIVEN THE TOPOGRAPHY TO PROVIDE 

[Captioner] 20:34:02
THAT COVERAGE GAP CLOSE

[Captioner] 20:34:05
 CLOSURES, THAT 

[Captioner] 20:34:08
IS THE MANDATE FOR THIS STAFF 

[Captioner] 20:34:08
REVIEW.

[Captioner] 20:34:09
>> Councilmember Salwan:   THANK 

[Captioner] 20:34:10
YOU.

[Captioner] 20:34:11
QUESTION FROM COUNCILMEMBER 

[Captioner] 20:34:12
CAMPBELL AND THEN COUNCILMEMBER 

[Captioner] 20:34:14
COX.

[Captioner] 20:34:15
>> Councilmember Campbell:   I'M 

[Captioner] 20:34:16
JUST CURIOUS ABOUT THE SET BACK 

[Captioner] 20:34:18
AND THE RULE REGARDING THE SET 

[Captioner] 20:34:18
BACK.

[Captioner] 20:34:20
IS THE SET BACK FROM THE 

[Captioner] 20:34:20
STREET?

[Captioner] 20:34:21
IS IT FROM BUILDINGS?

[Captioner] 20:34:22
IS IT THERE HOUSING?

[Captioner] 20:34:26
OR WHAT IS IT FROM ?

[Captioner] 20:34:27
>> Planner Pullen:   IT IS FROM 

[Captioner] 20:34:28
HOUSING.

[Captioner] 20:34:29
>> Councilmember Campbell:   

[Captioner] 20:34:31
OKAY, IT HAS TO BE HOUSING, 

[Captioner] 20:34:32
DOESN'T MATTER IF IT'S 100 FEET 

[Captioner] 20:34:34
FROM A BUILDING?

[Captioner] 20:34:34
>> Planner Pullen:   THAT'S 

[Captioner] 20:34:35
RIGHT.

[Captioner] 20:34:37
IN FACT MANY OF OUR HOTELS AND 

[Captioner] 20:34:38
OTHER FACILITIES HAVE WIRELESS 

[Captioner] 20:34:40
FACILITIES MOUNTED RIGHT ON THE 

[Captioner] 20:34:42
EDGE OF A COMMERCIAL BUILDING 

[Captioner] 20:34:44
AND THERE IS NOTICE PROHIBITION 

[Captioner] 20:34:46
AGAINST THAT, IT IS A NORTHERLY 

[Captioner] 20:34:47
ENVIRONMENT.

[Captioner] 20:34:48
WHAT MAY BE PART OF THE 

[Captioner] 20:34:49
CONVERSATION HERE IS THE THOUGHT 

[Captioner] 20:34:52
THAT MAYBE THE 100 FEET RELATES 

[Captioner] 20:34:55
TO RF LIMIT AND THAT ACTUALLY 

[Captioner] 20:34:56
ISN'T REALLY THE CASE.

[Captioner] 20:34:58
IF YOU LOOK AT THE RF STUDY HERE 

[Captioner] 20:35:02
THERE IS ABOUT A TWOA.5% OF THE 

[Captioner] 20:35:04
ALLOWABLE FCC LIMIT PROJECTION 

[Captioner] 20:35:08
THAT RF OFF OF THE ANTENNA 

[Captioner] 20:35:10
ITSELF SO EFFECTIVELY IT WOULD 

[Captioner] 20:35:12
ONLY BE SOMEBODY CLIMBING ON 

[Captioner] 20:35:14
THAT TOWER THAT WOULD BE EXPOSED 

[Captioner] 20:35:17
FROM A TECHNICAL STAND.

[Captioner] 20:35:21
THAT IS MORE THERE AN ESTHETIC 

[Captioner] 20:35:24
DESIGN THAN A REASON.

[Captioner] 20:35:24
>> Councilmember Campbell:   I 

[Captioner] 20:35:26
DO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT STUDENTS 

[Captioner] 20:35:28
AND STAFF AND THE STORY BEING SO 

[Captioner] 20:35:30
CLOSE TO -- TOWER BEING SOW 

[Captioner] 20:35:32
CLOSE TO WHERE STUDENTS AND 

[Captioner] 20:35:33
STAFF ARE GOING TO BE.

[Captioner] 20:35:35
I'M JUST CONCERNED ABOUT THE 

[Captioner] 20:35:38
EXPOSURE, WHILE YOU INDICATED 

[Captioner] 20:35:40
THAT THE EXPOSURE COULD BE AND 

[Captioner] 20:35:43
PROBABLY IS MINIMAL, IT'S STILL, 

[Captioner] 20:35:44
THERE IS STILL A LOT OF PEOPLE 

[Captioner] 20:35:47
ASSOCIATED WITH THIS PARTICULAR 

[Captioner] 20:35:49
LOCATION.

[Captioner] 20:35:52
HOTELS, I DON'T KNOW THAT THEY 

[Captioner] 20:35:55
HAVE 80 FOOT TOWERS THAT HAVE 

[Captioner] 20:35:59
THE POSSIBILITY OF EXPOSURE

[Captioner] 20:35:59
 TO 

[Captioner] 20:36:01
CANCER-CAUSING AGENTS.

[Captioner] 20:36:04
SO I'M A LITTLE CORNERED, THAT 

[Captioner] 20:36:06
PERHAPS WE PROBABLY MAYBE 

[Captioner] 20:36:07
CIRCULATE HAVE LOOKED AT SOME 

[Captioner] 20:36:09
OTHER LOCATIONS THAT HAVE A 

[Captioner] 20:36:11
FURTHER SET BACK AWAY FROM 

[Captioner] 20:36:11
BUILDINGS.

[Captioner] 20:36:14
WHERE YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE MORE 

[Captioner] 20:36:16
TRAFFIC, MORE HUMAN TRAFFIC.

[Captioner] 20:36:19
SO I'M A BIT CONCERNED ABOUT 

[Captioner] 20:36:21
THAT, I WAS CONCERNED ABOUT THE 

[Captioner] 20:36:21
TAMPG.

[Captioner] 20:36:24
THAT'S WHY I KIND OF BROUGHT IT 

[Captioner] 20:36:25
UP FROM THE BEGINNING.

[Captioner] 20:36:27
I WASN'T COMFORTABLE WITH HAVING 

[Captioner] 20:36:30
A GAS TANK ON THIS -- AT THAT 

[Captioner] 20:36:31
LOCATION.

[Captioner] 20:36:35
AND ALSO, WHERE IT'S SITTING ON 

[Captioner] 20:36:36
THE TOWER, WHERE IT WOULD BE 

[Captioner] 20:36:37
SITTING, IT'S REALLY SITTING 

[Captioner] 20:36:40
RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE BUILDING.

[Captioner] 20:36:42
BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO REMOVE 

[Captioner] 20:36:43
THE TREE AND THE TREE WAS 

[Captioner] 20:36:45
SITTING IN FRONT OF THE 

[Captioner] 20:36:45
BUILDING.

[Captioner] 20:36:48
NOW YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A TOWER 

[Captioner] 20:36:49
THAT'S ACTUALLY RIGHT IN FRONT 

[Captioner] 20:36:50
OF THE BUILDING.

[Captioner] 20:36:52
I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT IS 

[Captioner] 20:36:53
ESTHETICALLY PLEASING EVEN 

[Captioner] 20:36:55
THOUGH IT'S GOING TOAB A FAKE 

[Captioner] 20:36:57
TREE SO I HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF A 

[Captioner] 20:36:58
CONCERN ABOUT THAT.

[Captioner] 20:37:01
AND I REALLY -- I'M A BIT 

[Captioner] 20:37:02
CONCERNED ABOUT THE HEIGHT AS 

[Captioner] 20:37:02
WELL.

[Captioner] 20:37:04
I REALLY -- IF WE WERE GOING TO 

[Captioner] 20:37:07
DO IT, I'D RATHER SEE IT MORE 

[Captioner] 20:37:09
LEVEL, TO THE SIZE OF THE 

[Captioner] 20:37:10
BUILDING ITSELF.

[Captioner] 20:37:12
IF YOU MOVE IT, I PROBABLY 

[Captioner] 20:37:14
WOULDN'T HAVE AS MUCH OF A 

[Captioner] 20:37:17
CONCERN ABOUT THE HEIGHT.

[Captioner] 20:37:19
SO AT THIS POINT I'M NOTE LIKE 

[Captioner] 20:37:21
CONVINCED THAT THIS IS THE BEST 

[Captioner] 20:37:24
ABOUT ALTERNATIVE FOR OHLONE 

[Captioner] 20:37:26
COLLEGE AND THE SURROUNDING 

[Captioner] 20:37:29
COMMUNITY.

[Captioner] 20:37:29
>> Councilmember Salwan:   THANK 

[Captioner] 20:37:32
YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS.

[Captioner] 20:37:32
[APPLAUSE]

[Captioner] 20:37:33
>> Councilmember Salwan:   JUST 

[Captioner] 20:37:35
MATTER OF PROTOCOL, YOU KNOW, 

[Captioner] 20:37:37
THIS IS ONE OF THE FEW ROLES 

[Captioner] 20:37:40
WHERE WE'RE IN AAS I BELIEVE A 

[Captioner] 20:37:42
QUASIJUDICIAL CAPACITY.

[Captioner] 20:37:46
WHERE WE'RE LOOKING AT EXISTING 

[Captioner] 20:37:48
LAWS AND TRYING TO APPLY THEM.

[Captioner] 20:37:50
THIS IS ONE OF OUR TRADITIONAL 

[Captioner] 20:37:51
FUNCTIONS AS A CITY COUNCIL.

[Captioner] 20:37:54
I WANTED TO GET THE PURVIEW FROM 

[Captioner] 20:37:55
OUR CITY ATTORNEY WHAT IS OUR 

[Captioner] 20:37:56
SCOPE HERE AND WHAT FINDINGS DO 

[Captioner] 20:37:58
WE NEED AND WHAT BASIS ARE WE 

[Captioner] 20:38:00
ABLE TO REJECT THIS PROJECT SO 

[Captioner] 20:38:03
THAT WE ARE ON GOOD FOOTING 

[Captioner] 20:38:08
LEGALLY AND DEFENSIBLY?

[Captioner] 20:38:11
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado:   THANK 

[Captioner] 20:38:13
YOU COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN.

[Captioner] 20:38:14
THE BODY TO CONSIDER THE 

[Captioner] 20:38:16
EVIDENCE PROPONENTED HERE THEY 

[Captioner] 20:38:18
LARGELY COME DOWN TO TWO 

[Captioner] 20:38:18
ISSUES.

[Captioner] 20:38:21
THUMB 1 IS, FCC REGULATIONS, AND 

[Captioner] 20:38:24
THE OTHER IS, OUR LOCAL LAND USE 

[Captioner] 20:38:25
REGULATIONS.

[Captioner] 20:38:27
NOW IF WE TURN TO THE STAFF 

[Captioner] 20:38:30
REPORT, SPECIFICALLY PAGE 5 OF 

[Captioner] 20:38:32
THE STAFF REPORT WHERE THE STAFF 

[Captioner] 20:38:34
OUTLINES WHAT THE FINDINGS FOR 

[Captioner] 20:38:36
APPROVAL WOULD BE, THOSE ARE THE 

[Captioner] 20:38:38
LOCAL STANDARDS THAT MUST BE MET 

[Captioner] 20:38:40
IN ORDER TO APPROVE THE 

[Captioner] 20:38:40
PROJECT.

[Captioner] 20:38:42
WHICH STAFF RECOMMENDS APPROVAL 

[Captioner] 20:38:44
BASED UPON THE EVIDENCE IN THE 

[Captioner] 20:38:45
RECORD.

[Captioner] 20:38:47
OF COURSE, THE COUNCIL IS 

[Captioner] 20:38:48
SUPPOSE OWED TO TAKE EVIDENCE 

[Captioner] 20:38:51
TODAY AND WEIGH THAT IN LINE 

[Captioner] 20:38:52
WITH THESE STANDARDS.

[Captioner] 20:38:55
AND MAKE ITS OWN 

[Captioner] 20:38:55
DETERMINATIONS.

[Captioner] 20:38:58
BUT THESE ARE STANDARDS THAT THE 

[Captioner] 20:38:59
COUNCIL MUST APPLY.

[Captioner] 20:39:01
SO FOR EXAMPLE, ON RF 

[Captioner] 20:39:03
COMMUNICATIONS AND THE WIRELESS 

[Captioner] 20:39:07
TRANSMISSIONS THAT WERE RAISED, 

[Captioner] 20:39:09
THERE IS REGULATIONS THAT IMPACT 

[Captioner] 20:39:11
YOUR ABILITY TO DENY THE PROJECT 

[Captioner] 20:39:13
ON THAT BASIS.

[Captioner] 20:39:14
SO IF YOU GO TO THE STAFF REPORT 

[Captioner] 20:39:17
WHERE IT ADDRESSES THIS ISSUE, 

[Captioner] 20:39:19
FCC REGULATIONS BASICALLY LIMITS 

[Captioner] 20:39:21
THE CITY'S ABILITY TO DENY A 

[Captioner] 20:39:23
PROJECT IF THE PROJECT MEETS 

[Captioner] 20:39:24
CERTAIN STANDARDS.

[Captioner] 20:39:30
SPECIFICALLY IF THE FEDERAL

[Captioner] 20:39:30
 

[Captioner] 20:39:33
TELECOMMUNICATIONS ACT OF 1986, 

[Captioner] 20:39:34
WHICH IS THE ACT THAT WAS 

[Captioner] 20:39:36
REFERRED TO EARLIER, IT 

[Captioner] 20:39:38
BASICALLY PREEMPTS LOCAL 

[Captioner] 20:39:40
GOVERNMENTS ABILITY TO DENY THE 

[Captioner] 20:39:42
APPLICATION ON THE BASIS OF 

[Captioner] 20:39:44
CONCERNS REGULATING RADIO 

[Captioner] 20:39:47
FREQUENCY, IN SITUATIONS WHERE 

[Captioner] 20:39:51
THEY'VE MET THE FCC -- CONSUME

[Captioner] 20:39:52
, 

[Captioner] 20:39:54
THE FTA STANDARDS AND THE 

[Captioner] 20:39:55
REGULATIONS THAT ARISE FROM IT.

[Captioner] 20:39:57
AND HERE THE STAFF REPORT MAKES 

[Captioner] 20:39:59
IT CLEAR THAT THEY'VE MET THAT 

[Captioner] 20:40:01
STANDARD SO THAT WOULD NOT BE A 

[Captioner] 20:40:02
BASIS ON WHICH TO DENY THE 

[Captioner] 20:40:04
APPLICATION THIS EVENING 

[Captioner] 20:40:05
SPECIFIC TO THAT ISSUE.

[Captioner] 20:40:08
THE REST OF THE ISSUES COME DOWN 

[Captioner] 20:40:10
TO THE STANDARDS IN OUR OWN 

[Captioner] 20:40:12
LOCAL CODE AND YOU WILL HAVE TO 

[Captioner] 20:40:16
WEIGH WHETHER THE APPELLANT HAS

[Captioner] 20:40:16
 

[Captioner] 20:40:20
DEMONSTRATED NOT MET THE 

[Captioner] 20:40:23
APPLICANT'S STANDARDS THIS 

[Captioner] 20:40:23
EVENING.

[Captioner] 20:40:24
>> Councilmember Salwan:   THANK 

[Captioner] 20:40:24
YOU.

[Captioner] 20:40:26
WE DON'T HAVE ANY INDEPENDENT 

[Captioner] 20:40:27
WAY OF VERIFYING THAT THOSE ARE 

[Captioner] 20:40:29
THE ONLY TWO SITES THAT ARE 

[Captioner] 20:40:31
AVAILABLE, IS THERE A WAY TO GET 

[Captioner] 20:40:32
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION TOE SEE 

[Captioner] 20:40:34
IF THERE ARE OTHER SITES THAT 

[Captioner] 20:40:35
ARE ACCEPTABLE?

[Captioner] 20:40:37
BECAUSE I'M HEARING SOME OF OUR 

[Captioner] 20:40:38
COUNCILMEMBERS SHOWING SOME 

[Captioner] 20:40:39
CONCERN REGARDING THAT.

[Captioner] 20:40:41
AND I WOULD LIKE TOE SEE IF 

[Captioner] 20:40:43
THERE'S A POSITIVE PATH 

[Captioner] 20:40:43
FORWARD.

[Captioner] 20:40:54
>> Planner Pullen:   SO THE 

[Captioner] 20:40:56
APPLICANT HAS PROVIDED THEIR 

[Captioner] 20:40:57
ANALYSIS.

[Captioner] 20:40:58
I THINK YOU HEARD FROM THE 

[Captioner] 20:41:00
APPLICANT IS THAT THEY RELY ON 

[Captioner] 20:41:01
WILLING LAND OWNERS.

[Captioner] 20:41:03
SO IF YOU LOOK TO THE NORTH 

[Captioner] 20:41:04
THERE IS DRONES THOSE AREN'T 

[Captioner] 20:41:08
ALLOWED TOE HAVE A PULL ON 

[Captioner] 20:41:08
THEM.

[Captioner] 20:41:10
THE OHLONE COLLEGE CAMPUS IS 

[Captioner] 20:41:12
LOUD TO HAVE A PULL ON IT, WITH 

[Captioner] 20:41:14
100 FEET AWAY FROM THAT 

[Captioner] 20:41:15
RESIDENTIAL.

[Captioner] 20:41:17
AND THEY IN THEIR CONSULTATION 

[Captioner] 20:41:19
WITH OHLONE COLLEGE HAVE COME UP 

[Captioner] 20:41:21
WITH TWO SITES THAT MEET THEIR 

[Captioner] 20:41:21
STANDARDS.

[Captioner] 20:41:23
THE WAY THIS WORKS THROUGH 

[Captioner] 20:41:25
TECHNICAL REVIEW IS THAT STAFF 

[Captioner] 20:41:26
CAN'T PERFORM OUR OWN ANALYSIS 

[Captioner] 20:41:27
OF THOSE THINGS.

[Captioner] 20:41:31
WE RELY ON THEIR WORKING WITH 

[Captioner] 20:41:33
THE PROPERTY OWNER TO COME UP 

[Captioner] 20:41:34
WITH A SOLUTION AND TO SHOW US 

[Captioner] 20:41:36
THAT DATA.

[Captioner] 20:41:38
THAT'S HOW WE PROCEED WITH 

[Captioner] 20:41:38
THESE.

[Captioner] 20:41:42
>> Councilmember Salwan:   OKAY, 

[Captioner] 20:41:45
THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 20:41:45
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado:   ONE 

[Captioner] 20:41:47
WAY YOU WANT TO LOOK AT THIS AS 

[Captioner] 20:41:49
MENTIONED IN THE STAFF REPORT WE 

[Captioner] 20:41:51
CAN'T DENY AN APPLICATION UNLESS 

[Captioner] 20:41:52
THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT 

[Captioner] 20:41:53
DEMONSTRATES OWN THIS SPECIFIC 

[Captioner] 20:41:55
ISSUE THAT THE FACILITY IS, 

[Captioner] 20:41:58
UNLESS THE PEENT HAS 

[Captioner] 20:42:00
DEMONSTRATED THAT THE APPLICANT 

[Captioner] 20:42:01
CANNOT MEET THE FOLLOWING 

[Captioner] 20:42:02
STANDARD THAT THE FACILITY IS 

[Captioner] 20:42:04
NECESSARY TO FILL A SIGNIFICANT 

[Captioner] 20:42:06
GAP IN THE APPLICANT'S OWN 

[Captioner] 20:42:09
WIRELESS NETWORK AND TWO THE 

[Captioner] 20:42:11
FACILITY IS THE LEAST INTRUSIVE 

[Captioner] 20:42:12
MEANS EVER FILLING THE SERVICE 

[Captioner] 20:42:13
GAP.

[Captioner] 20:42:14
YOU'VE HEARD THIS EVENING FROM 

[Captioner] 20:42:15
THE APPLICANT THAT THEY REQUIRE 

[Captioner] 20:42:18
THIS TOWER BASED ON THOSE TWO 

[Captioner] 20:42:21
OBJECTIVES AND THE APPELLANT IS 

[Captioner] 20:42:23
PEALINGS THIS EVENING BY STATING 

[Captioner] 20:42:24
THAT THEY CAN'T MEET THAT 

[Captioner] 20:42:24
STANDARD.

[Captioner] 20:42:27
YOU HAVE TO WEIGH THAT EVIDENCE 

[Captioner] 20:42:27
AND MAKE A DETERMINATION.

[Captioner] 20:42:29
BUT THAT'S THE STANDARD.

[Captioner] 20:42:31
YOU HAVE TO DETERMINE WHETHER 

[Captioner] 20:42:33
THE APPELLANT HAS DEMONSTRATED 

[Captioner] 20:42:33
THAT THE APPLICANT HAS NOT MET 

[Captioner] 20:42:34
THAT STANDARD.

[Captioner] 20:42:36
STAFF IS OF THE OPINION THAT 

[Captioner] 20:42:37
RELYING ON THE EVIDENCE 

[Captioner] 20:42:39
PRESENTED BY THE APPLICANT, THE 

[Captioner] 20:42:40
APPLICANT HAS MET THAT 

[Captioner] 20:42:40
STANDARD.

[Captioner] 20:42:42
>> Councilmember Salwan:   THANK 

[Captioner] 20:42:43
YOU.

[Captioner] 20:42:45
MOVING ON COUNCILMEMBER COX.

[Captioner] 20:42:45
QUESTIONS.

[Captioner] 20:42:51
>> Councilmember Cox:   I THINK

[Captioner] 20:42:55
THINK -- MY ONLY OTHER QUESTION 

[Captioner] 20:42:58
WOULD HAVE BEEN THAT -- WE'RE 

[Captioner] 20:43:00
ONLY GIVEN TWO SPOTS AND IT WAS 

[Captioner] 20:43:01
BASICALLY GOT DOWN TO THE ONE 

[Captioner] 20:43:03
THAT WAS SELECTED AS THE BEST 

[Captioner] 20:43:05
CHOICE.

[Captioner] 20:43:07
AND I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY OTHERS 

[Captioner] 20:43:09
WERE BEFORE THAT, IN YOUR 

[Captioner] 20:43:11
DISCUSSION, OR MAYBE CITY STAFF 

[Captioner] 20:43:13
CAN SHARE, WAS THERE ANY OTHER 

[Captioner] 20:43:17
OPTIONS OF OTHER LOCATIONS 

[Captioner] 20:43:18
BESIDES WE GOT DOWN TO THE FINAL 

[Captioner] 20:43:19
TWO?

[Captioner] 20:43:20
DID YOU START WITH 20 AND THEN, 

[Captioner] 20:43:22
YOU KNOW, WORKED YOUR WAY DOWN?

[Captioner] 20:43:23
I DIDN'T SEE THAT EXACTLY IN THE 

[Captioner] 20:43:24
REPORT.

[Captioner] 20:43:25
I SAW MORE OF A HIGH LEVEL.

[Captioner] 20:43:27
AND IF YOU COULD SHARE SOME 

[Captioner] 20:43:28
INSIGHT ON THAT THAT WOULD BE 

[Captioner] 20:43:30
VERY HELPFUL TOO.

[Captioner] 20:43:31
>> SURE.

[Captioner] 20:43:33
I BELIEVE INITIALLY THEY LOOKED 

[Captioner] 20:43:35
AT 12 TOTAL LOCATIONS.

[Captioner] 20:43:37
AGAIN THEY DO HAVE A SEARCH RING 

[Captioner] 20:43:39
THAT THEY HAVE TO BE WITHIN 

[Captioner] 20:43:40
NOARD TO MAKE THE COVERAGE GOALS 

[Captioner] 20:43:43
OF THAT SERVICE GAP.

[Captioner] 20:43:45
AS I SAID, THEY ARE LOOKING 

[Captioner] 20:43:46
TARPD CAMPUS AND AS THE 

[Captioner] 20:43:48
APPLICANT STATED THEY WORKED 

[Captioner] 20:43:50
WITH THE CAMPUS TO GET AN AREA 

[Captioner] 20:43:52
THAT THEY WOULD BE WILLING TO 

[Captioner] 20:43:53
LEASE TO THEM.

[Captioner] 20:43:54
AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT IT COMES 

[Captioner] 20:43:55
DOWN TO.

[Captioner] 20:43:57
THEY CAN'T NECESSARILY PICK AND 

[Captioner] 20:43:59
CHOOSE WHERE THEY WANT, THEY 

[Captioner] 20:44:01
HAVE TO COME TO AN AGREEMENT 

[Captioner] 20:44:04
WITHIN THE CAMPUS THAT WILL BE 

[Captioner] 20:44:06
LEASED TO MEET THEIR COVERAGE 

[Captioner] 20:44:08
NEEDS, THAT IS ALSO WITHIN AN 

[Captioner] 20:44:10
AREA THROUGH THESE INTRUSIVE 

[Captioner] 20:44:11
MOVES, CHOOSING A TREE THAT IS 

[Captioner] 20:44:16
OF A SIMILAR TYPE TO THE

[Captioner] 20:44:16
 AREA, 

[Captioner] 20:44:18
THIS IS THE ONE LOCATION THAT 

[Captioner] 20:44:20
SEEMED TO WORK BEST TO THEM.

[Captioner] 20:44:22
AND IT DID COME DOWN TOTE TWO 

[Captioner] 20:44:26
AND OF THE TWO THIS WAS 21 THAT 

[Captioner] 20:44:28
SEEMED TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE 

[Captioner] 20:44:30
LESS EAND THE APPLICANT AS 

[Captioner] 20:44:30
WELL.

[Captioner] 20:44:33
>> Councilmember Cox:   DID THIS 

[Captioner] 20:44:37
GO BEFORE THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES

[Captioner] 20:44:37
 

[Captioner] 20:44:41
OF OHLONE COLLEGES,.

[Captioner] 20:44:42
>> Planner Pullen:   I DOESN'T 

[Captioner] 20:44:43
KNOW ABOUT THE ACTUAL ACTIONS 

[Captioner] 20:44:45
BUT I KNOW THAT THE COLLEGE 

[Captioner] 20:44:46
ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTION IS 

[Captioner] 20:44:48
SUPPORTIVE OF THIS APPLICATION 

[Captioner] 20:44:49
AND HAS REACHED OUT TO US AND 

[Captioner] 20:44:51
TOLD US THAT.

[Captioner] 20:44:53
>> Councilmember Cox:   OKAY.

[Captioner] 20:44:54
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado:   AND 

[Captioner] 20:44:55
IT IS IMPORTANT TOE RECALL THAT 

[Captioner] 20:44:57
ON THE SET BACK ISSUE, THAT IS A 

[Captioner] 20:45:00
LOCAL STANDARD IT IS 100 FEET 

[Captioner] 20:45:02
THEY EXCEED THAT SO FOR PURPOSES 

[Captioner] 20:45:04
OF DRAIRTING WHETHER THEY MEET A 

[Captioner] 20:45:08
LOCAL LAND USE REGULATION, THEY 

[Captioner] 20:45:10
MEET AND EXCEED IT, DESPITE THE 

[Captioner] 20:45:14
OBJECTIONS TO THE DISTANCE FROM 

[Captioner] 20:45:16
WHERE, YOU KNOW, THE APPELLANT 

[Captioner] 20:45:17
WOULD LIKE THE -- THE APPELLANT 

[Captioner] 20:45:19
WOULD LIKE IT TO BE, THE FACT IS 

[Captioner] 20:45:22
THAT IT DOES MEET THE CITY 

[Captioner] 20:45:23
STANDARDS WITH RESPECT TO 

[Captioner] 20:45:24
SETBACKS.

[Captioner] 20:45:24
>> Councilmember Cox:   THANK

[Captioner] 20:45:36
ANYBODY --

[Captioner] 20:45:36
>> Councilmember Kassan:   I DO 

[Captioner] 20:45:38
HAVE A QUESTION.

[Captioner] 20:45:40
>> Councilmember Salwan:   YES, 

[Captioner] 20:45:43
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN.

[Captioner] 20:45:43
>> Councilmember Kassan:   I DO 

[Captioner] 20:45:45
UNDERSTAND THAT SOME CITIES DO 

[Captioner] 20:45:47
HAVE STRICTER REGULATIONS ABOUT 

[Captioner] 20:45:50
THE LOCATIONS OF THESE TOWERS.

[Captioner] 20:45:52
YOU KNOW, I LOVE TO HEAR MORE 

[Captioner] 20:45:55
ABOUT WHAT DECISIONS -- HOW THE 

[Captioner] 20:45:58
DECISION WAS MADE IN FREMONT NOT 

[Captioner] 20:46:00
TOE FOLLOW SUIT WITH WHAT SOME 

[Captioner] 20:46:03
OTHER CITIES ARE DOING TO -- 

[Captioner] 20:46:05
THAT ARE MORE RESTRICTIVE IN 

[Captioner] 20:46:06
TERMS OF THE LOCATION OF THE 

[Captioner] 20:46:12
TOWERS.

[Captioner] 20:46:13
>> Planner Pullen:   IT WAS A 

[Captioner] 20:46:15
LITTLE HARD TO HEAR BUT THAT'S A 

[Captioner] 20:46:17
QUESTION OF STAFF, RIGHT?

[Captioner] 20:46:17
>> Councilmember Salwan:   YES.

[Captioner] 20:46:18
>> Planner Pullen:   IT WAS A 

[Captioner] 20:46:20
LITTLE HARD TO HEAR BUT I 

[Captioner] 20:46:21
UNDERSTOOD THE QUESTION TO BE 

[Captioner] 20:46:22
THAT YOU'RE INTERESTED IN 

[Captioner] 20:46:24
KNOWING WHY THE CITY DOESN'T 

[Captioner] 20:46:25
HAVE MORE STRICT STANDARDS FOR 

[Captioner] 20:46:27
WIRELESS.

[Captioner] 20:46:29
COMPARED.

[Captioner] 20:46:29
>> Councilmember Salwan:   

[Captioner] 20:46:30
COMPARED TO OTHER CITIES LIKE 

[Captioner] 20:46:32
THE ONE OR TWOA THAT WERE 

[Captioner] 20:46:32
MENTION OWED.

[Captioner] 20:46:34
>> Planner Pullen:   SO THE CITY 

[Captioner] 20:46:36
WAS, HAD A RULE INFORM WIRELESS 

[Captioner] 20:46:37
SINCE 1996.

[Captioner] 20:46:39
WE'VE ADDED TO THAT SEVERAL 

[Captioner] 20:46:41
TIMES INCLUDING TO ADJUST THE 

[Captioner] 20:46:42
STANDARDS BASED ON INDUSTRY 

[Captioner] 20:46:44
TRENDS.

[Captioner] 20:46:48
AND WE FEEL THAT OUR ORDINANCE

[Captioner] 20:46:48
 

[Captioner] 20:46:50
IS IN LINE WITH TYPICAL 

[Captioner] 20:46:51
ORDINANCES FOR CITIES.

[Captioner] 20:46:53
THERE ARE SOME CITIES THAT ARE 

[Captioner] 20:46:55
MORE RESTRICTIVE BUT OFTEN THOSE 

[Captioner] 20:46:59
MORE RESTRICTIVE REGULATIONS 

[Captioner] 20:47:01
LIMIT WIRELESS FACILITIES TO THE 

[Captioner] 20:47:04
POINT THAT THEY WOULD BE 

[Captioner] 20:47:06
SOMETIMES IMPOSSIBLE TOE COMPLY 

[Captioner] 20:47:06
WITH THEM.

[Captioner] 20:47:08
AND THEN WHEN YOU CAN'T COMPLY 

[Captioner] 20:47:10
WITH THEM UNDER FEDERAL LAW, YOU 

[Captioner] 20:47:13
HAVE TO STILL FOLLOW THE LAWS 

[Captioner] 20:47:15
THAT THE CITY ATTORNEY 

[Captioner] 20:47:16
REFERENCED, WHICH IS TO FILL 

[Captioner] 20:47:19
GAPS, YOU MAY HAVE TO BREAK YOUR 

[Captioner] 20:47:23
OWN RULES IN ORDER TO MAKE THAT 

[Captioner] 20:47:24
FACILITY FEASIBLE TO SERVE 

[Captioner] 20:47:27
PEOPLE WHO NEED TOE GET WIRELESS 

[Captioner] 20:47:27
COVERAGE.

[Captioner] 20:47:29
AND SO WHILE THERE MAY BE CITIES 

[Captioner] 20:47:31
WITH MORE -- WITH STRONGER RULES 

[Captioner] 20:47:33
OR MORE LET'S SAY LARGER 

[Captioner] 20:47:35
SETBACKS, ET CETERA, THEY'LL 

[Captioner] 20:47:37
NEED TO COMPLY WITH THE FEDERAL 

[Captioner] 20:47:40
LAW WITH RESPECT TO RF AND 

[Captioner] 20:47:41
SITING THAT ALLOWS THE SAME 

[Captioner] 20:47:44
LEVEL OF COANCH.

[Captioner] 20:47:44

[Captioner] 21:04:28
OVER WHAT THE ORIGINAL 

[Captioner] 21:04:28

[Captioner] 21:04:47
NEEDS ASSESSMENT.

[Captioner] 21:04:51

WEBSITE, I'M LETTING YOU FOLKS 

[Captioner] 21:04:55

[Captioner] 21:04:59
THE DATA HERE IS A LITTLE BIT 

[Captioner] 21:04:59
OLD.

[Captioner] 21:05:02
WE'VE HAD OVER 5,000 VISITORS 

[Captioner] 21:05:04

[Captioner] 21:05:06
SO IT'S BEEN A COUPLE OF MONTHS 

[Captioner] 21:05:07
AND I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT.

[Captioner] 21:05:09
BUT THIS SITE HAS BEEN UP AND 

[Captioner] 21:05:10
WILL REMAIN UP.

[Captioner] 21:05:11
AND ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT 

[Captioner] 21:05:14
PARTS IS WE'RE ASKING FOLKS TO 

[Captioner] 21:05:16
TAKE A SURVEY TO IDENTIFY OR THE 

[Captioner] 21:05:17
THEMSELVES AND THEIR NEIGHBORS 

[Captioner] 21:05:19
AND THEIR COMMUNITY THEIR CITY 

[Captioner] 21:05:20

[Captioner] 21:05:22
ARE THERE THEIR PERSPECTIVE AND 

[Captioner] 21:05:24
WE'LL TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT 

[Captioner] 21:05:26

[Captioner] 21:05:31
SO AS A KEY FINDING TO, YOU 

[Captioner] 21:05:33

[Captioner] 21:05:37
HOUSING NEEDS AS THE COUNTY GREW 

[Captioner] 21:05:40
OVER 200,000 PEOPLE, OUR CITY 

[Captioner] 21:05:42
GREW SIGNIFICANTLY AS WELL 

[Captioner] 21:05:43
BETWEEN 9 AND 15%.

[Captioner] 21:05:45
SOME OF OUR CITIES GREW MORE 

[Captioner] 21:05:47
THAN OTHERS, FOR INSTANCE DUBLIN 

[Captioner] 21:05:52
AND EMERYVILLE, DUBLIN OVER

[Captioner] 21:05:55
 150% 

[Captioner] 21:05:58
AND EMERY VIL OVER 80%.

[Captioner] 21:06:00
WHILE AT THE SAME TIME, SEEING A 

[Captioner] 21:06:02
GROWTH IN THE HIGHER INCOME 

[Captioner] 21:06:04
HOUSEHOLDS AND THE EXTREMELY LOW 

[Captioner] 21:06:05
HOUSEHOLDS.

[Captioner] 21:06:08
SO REALLY, THAT LOSS OF THOSE 

[Captioner] 21:06:09
MIDDLE INCOME HOUSEHOLDS IS 

[Captioner] 21:06:10
QUITE CONCERNING.

[Captioner] 21:06:11
AND THEN NEW HOUSING 

[Captioner] 21:06:15
CONSTRUCTION HASN'T -- HAS 

[Captioner] 21:06:18
FALLEN SHORT OF THE NEEDS WE'VE 

[Captioner] 21:06:19
SEEF AND HOUSING PRICES CONTINUE 

[Captioner] 21:06:21
TO EXCEED INCREASES IN INCOME 

[Captioner] 21:06:23
AND GOAN OUR RENTER HOUSEHOLDS 

[Captioner] 21:06:25
ARE MOST AT RISK.

[Captioner] 21:06:26
NEXT SLIDE.

[Captioner] 21:06:31
SO WE'VE IMOAN ENGAGING IN A -- 

[Captioner] 21:06:33
BEEN ENGAGING IN A COMMUNITY 

[Captioner] 21:06:34
OUTREACH PROCESS.

[Captioner] 21:06:36
WE'VE BEEN TALKING TO VARIOUS 

[Captioner] 21:06:38
COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS, 

[Captioner] 21:06:39
VARIOUS COMMUNITY GROUPS, AS 

[Captioner] 21:06:42
WELL AS HOLDING PUBLIC 

[Captioner] 21:06:42
MEETINGS.

[Captioner] 21:06:46
WE HELD ONE HERE IN THE FREMONT

[Captioner] 21:06:47
 

[Captioner] 21:06:50
CITY LIBRARY IN DECEMBER, OR 

[Captioner] 21:06:51
JANUARY, THIS JANUARY.

[Captioner] 21:06:55
BUT HAPPY TO ALSO HOLD MORE, AS 

[Captioner] 21:06:57
THEY ARE ASKED FOR AND NEEDED, 

[Captioner] 21:06:59
AND THERE IS A WAY TO REQUEST 

[Captioner] 21:07:01
THOSE EITHER THROUGH YOUR CITY 

[Captioner] 21:07:03
HOUSING STAFF OR ON OUR WEBSITE 

[Captioner] 21:07:05
AND WE'VE HAD MANY ORGANIZATIONS 

[Captioner] 21:07:06
REACH OUT AND WE'VE DONE 

[Captioner] 21:07:08
PRESENTATIONS TOE SPALL ORE 

[Captioner] 21:07:10
GROUPS AS THEY'VE ASKED FOR IT.

[Captioner] 21:07:11
NEXT SLIDE.

[Captioner] 21:07:16
SO WHAT IS THE REGIONAL HOISTING

[Captioner] 21:07:16
 BOND?

[Captioner] 21:07:16
THE BAY AREA HOUSING FINANCE 

[Captioner] 21:07:19
AGENCY IS AN ARM OF THE 

[Captioner] 21:07:20
METROPOLITAN TRANSPORTATION 

[Captioner] 21:07:20
COMMISSION.

[Captioner] 21:07:25
IT WAS CREATED IN 2019, IT'S

[Captioner] 21:07:26
 BY 

[Captioner] 21:07:27
STATE LEGISLATION AND I'M SORRY 

[Captioner] 21:07:28
I DON'T REMEMBER THE EXACT 

[Captioner] 21:07:30
NUMBER, CREATED THE ORGANIZATION 

[Captioner] 21:07:31
ITSELF.

[Captioner] 21:07:33
AND IT ALLOWS THEM TO TAKE ON 

[Captioner] 21:07:34
DOESN'T AND IT ALLOWS THEM TO 

[Captioner] 21:07:35
ISSUE BONDS.

[Captioner] 21:07:38
SO THEY HAVE DECIDED, NEXT 

[Captioner] 21:07:42
SLIDE, TO PLACE ON THE 2024 

[Captioner] 21:07:45
BALLOT, A TEN TO $20 BILLION 

[Captioner] 21:07:48
GENERAL BRITION BOND THAT WILL 

[Captioner] 21:07:50
REQUIRE VOTER APPROVAL TO 

[Captioner] 21:07:52
FINANCE NEW CONSTRUCTION AND 

[Captioner] 21:07:53
REHABILITATION AND REQUISITION 

[Captioner] 21:07:57
OF REAL PROPERTY -- ACQUISITION

[Captioner] 21:07:58
 

[Captioner] 21:08:00
OF REAL PROPERTY TO FACE THE 

[Captioner] 21:08:02
AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS WE ARE 

[Captioner] 21:08:03
FACING NOW.

[Captioner] 21:08:05
WHAT DOES AFFORDABLE HOUSING 

[Captioner] 21:08:07
MEAN, IT IS GENERALLY BELOW 

[Captioner] 21:08:10
MARKET RATE HOUSING FOR 

[Captioner] 21:08:13
HOUSEHOLDS THAT ARE EARNING 

[Captioner] 21:08:14
LOWER INCOMES.

[Captioner] 21:08:16
THERE WILL BE A COST FOR THE 

[Captioner] 21:08:18
GENERAL OBLIGATION BOND, IT IS 

[Captioner] 21:08:20
TAX THAT IS PLACED ON PROPERTY 

[Captioner] 21:08:20
VALUES.

[Captioner] 21:08:23
EXCUSE ME.

[Captioner] 21:08:25
SO FOR INSTANCE, IF AN OWNER 

[Captioner] 21:08:27
IS -- HAS A HOME THAT IS 

[Captioner] 21:08:29
ASSESSED FOR $1 MILLION THEY 

[Captioner] 21:08:30
WOULD BE PAYING ABOUT $100 A 

[Captioner] 21:08:31
YEAR.

[Captioner] 21:08:33
IF IT'S A $10 BILLION BOND.

[Captioner] 21:08:42
AND IF IT IS A $20 BILLION BOND, 

[Captioner] 21:08:44
IT WOULD BE APPROXIMATELY $200 A 

[Captioner] 21:08:44
CAREER.

[Captioner] 21:08:45
NEXT SLIDE.

[Captioner] 21:08:47
-- A YEAR.

[Captioner] 21:08:48
NEXT SLIDE.

[Captioner] 21:08:50
SO AT $10 BILLION WHAT DOES THAT 

[Captioner] 21:08:53
LOOK LIKE FOR THE ENTIRETY OF 

[Captioner] 21:08:54
ALAMEDA COUNTY?

[Captioner] 21:08:56
 IT'S ABOUT $1.3 BILLION THAT 

[Captioner] 21:08:58
WOULD COME BACK TO THE COUNTY.

[Captioner] 21:09:00
THE BAY AREA HOUSING FINANCE 

[Captioner] 21:09:02
AGENCY WOULD BE KEEPING SOME 

[Captioner] 21:09:03
AMOUNT OF THE MONEY BUT 80% 

[Captioner] 21:09:06
WOULD RETURN TO THE SOURCE AND 

[Captioner] 21:09:07
TO THE COUNTIES AND CITIES THAT 

[Captioner] 21:09:10
ARE PART OF THE NINE-COUNTY BAY 

[Captioner] 21:09:11
AREA.

[Captioner] 21:09:13
OAKLAND WITH A POPULATION OF 

[Captioner] 21:09:16
OVER 350,000, WILL RECEIVE ITS 

[Captioner] 21:09:17
OWN ALLOCATION.

[Captioner] 21:09:19
THE REST OF THE FUNDING WILL 

[Captioner] 21:09:20
FLOW TO THE COUNTY.

[Captioner] 21:09:22
AND WE HAVE VERY SPECIFIC POTS 

[Captioner] 21:09:24
OF MONEY IN WHICH WE HAVE TO 

[Captioner] 21:09:25
SPEND IT.

[Captioner] 21:09:28
SO PROHIBITION IS NEW -- 

[Captioner] 21:09:31
PRODUCTION IS NEW CONSTRUCTION.

[Captioner] 21:09:32
C COUNTY FUNDS IS REALLY THE 

[Captioner] 21:09:34
ABILITY TO FUND ADDITIONAL 

[Captioner] 21:09:36
THINGS LIKE FIRST TIME HOME BUY 

[Captioner] 21:09:38
ORE PROGRAMS .

[Captioner] 21:09:40
PRESERVATION IS THE REQUISITION, 

[Captioner] 21:09:43
REHABILITATION OR -- 

[Captioner] 21:09:48
QUALIFICATION OR THE --

[Captioner] 21:09:49
 

[Captioner] 21:09:53
 

[Captioner] 21:09:56
 IT IS 

[Captioner] 21:09:57
CONSIDERED WHAT YOU WOULD BE 

[Captioner] 21:09:58
INVESTING INTO YOUR EXISTING 

[Captioner] 21:09:59
HOUSING STOCK.

[Captioner] 21:10:01
PROTECTION IS ESSENTIALLY THINGS 

[Captioner] 21:10:03
LIKE TENANT PROTECTIONS, 

[Captioner] 21:10:05
OUTREACH EDUCATION, TENANT 

[Captioner] 21:10:07
RIGHTS, COUNSELING, THOSE KINDS 

[Captioner] 21:10:11
OF THINGS.

[Captioner] 21:10:13
SO WHAT DOSE IT LOOK LIKE IF WE 

[Captioner] 21:10:16
ARE TO TALK ABOUT HOW WE PLAN TO 

[Captioner] 21:10:18
DISTRIBUTE THE FUNDS WITHIN 

[Captioner] 21:10:19
ALAMEDA COUNTY?

[Captioner] 21:10:21
BASED ON WHAT WE DID WITH 

[Captioner] 21:10:23
MEASURE A Q1 WHICH YOU FOLKS 

[Captioner] 21:10:27
REMEMBER IS A $580 MILLION

[Captioner] 21:10:28
 

[Captioner] 21:10:29
GENERAL OBLIGATION BOND PASSED 

[Captioner] 21:10:33
BY THE VOTERS IN 2016, WE SEE 

[Captioner] 21:10:35
HERE IN MEASURE A 1, WE 

[Captioner] 21:10:37
DISTRIBUTED THE FUNDS DOWN TO 

[Captioner] 21:10:39
EACH OF THE CITIES, THERE WAS A 

[Captioner] 21:10:42
BASE CITY ALLOCATION AND IT WAS 

[Captioner] 21:10:44
BASED ON POPULATION AND THE 

[Captioner] 21:10:46
EXPECTED REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS 

[Captioner] 21:10:49
ALLOCATION FOR EACH CITY.

[Captioner] 21:10:53
AND KNOWN THERE WAS THE REGIONAL 

[Captioner] 21:10:54
POT OF FUNDING.

[Captioner] 21:10:55
AND THAT WAS BASED ON THE 

[Captioner] 21:10:57
HOMELESS COUNT AND POVERTY.

[Captioner] 21:10:59
AND SO WITH THAT BLEND WE CAME 

[Captioner] 21:11:01
UP WITH ENOUGH MONEY THAT WE 

[Captioner] 21:11:02
SENT MONEY DOWN TO EACH OF THE 

[Captioner] 21:11:04
CITIES SO THAT THEY KNEW EXACTLY 

[Captioner] 21:11:06
HOW MUCH MONEY THEY HAD TO PLAN 

[Captioner] 21:11:08
TO USE TO BUILD HOUSING.

[Captioner] 21:11:09
AND THEN THERE WAS A COMPETITION 

[Captioner] 21:11:12
FOR THE REGIONAL BOND FUNDS THAT 

[Captioner] 21:11:14
PRIORITIZED HOMELESS HOUSING.

[Captioner] 21:11:16
IN THAT SITUATION WE DIVIDED THE 

[Captioner] 21:11:18
FUNDS UP AND IT WAS A BLEND OF 

[Captioner] 21:11:21
MANY DIFFERENT METHODOLOGIES.

[Captioner] 21:11:22
THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT WOULD 

[Captioner] 21:11:25
BE IF WE RETURNED FUNDS TO 

[Captioner] 21:11:27
SOURCE, YOU CAN SEE HERE THAT 

[Captioner] 21:11:29
FREMONT WOULD BE GETTING 22% OF 

[Captioner] 21:11:31
THE PRODUCTION FUNDING.

[Captioner] 21:11:35
IF WE WERE TO USE THE

[Captioner] 21:11:37
 RHNA LOWER 

[Captioner] 21:11:39
INCOME NUMBER, YOU WOULD BE 

[Captioner] 21:11:41
GETTING APPROXIMATELY 21% BUT IF 

[Captioner] 21:11:42
WE ACCRUED THE POVERTY SHARE IT 

[Captioner] 21:11:43
WOULD BE CLOSE TO 12%.

[Captioner] 21:11:45
SO ALL OF THE CITIES WOULD BE 

[Captioner] 21:11:46
INTERESTED OF COURSE IN HOW 

[Captioner] 21:11:48
THESE FUNDS WOULD BE 

[Captioner] 21:11:48
DISTRIBUTED.

[Captioner] 21:11:50
THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT HAS 

[Captioner] 21:11:52
BEEN PRESENTED TO THE COUNTY FOR 

[Captioner] 21:11:55
SUPERVISORS YET, BUT IT IS 

[Captioner] 21:11:56
INFORMATION THAT WE'VE BEEN 

[Captioner] 21:11:57
SHARING WITH OUR CITY STAFF 

[Captioner] 21:11:59
MEMBERS TO TRY AND FIGURE OUT 

[Captioner] 21:12:02
WHAT'S THE BEST WAY TO ALLOCATE 

[Captioner] 21:12:03
THESE FUNDS.

[Captioner] 21:12:05
NEXT SLIDE.

[Captioner] 21:12:08
THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 21:12:09
SO HERE ARE THE TYPES OF 

[Captioner] 21:12:10
PROGRAMS, PRODUCTION IS OF 

[Captioner] 21:12:12
COURSE NEW CONSTRUCTION.

[Captioner] 21:12:15
AND IT IS GENERALLY ALLOCATED 

[Captioner] 21:12:17
TOWARDS THINGS LIKE TAX CREDIT 

[Captioner] 21:12:18
PROJECTS.

[Captioner] 21:12:20
HOWEVER THERE IS A VERY 

[Captioner] 21:12:20
SIGNIFICANT GROUP OF PEOPLE HAD 

[Captioner] 21:12:22
A HAVE BEEN SEEING THEY WOULD 

[Captioner] 21:12:24
LIKE TOE SEE TINY HOMES 

[Captioner] 21:12:25
SUPPORTED IN OUR PRODUCTION AS 

[Captioner] 21:12:26
WELL.

[Captioner] 21:12:29
PRESERVATION IS THE IDEA THAT WE 

[Captioner] 21:12:35
HAVE THE ACQUISITION OF MULTI

[Captioner] 21:12:38
MULTIPEOPLE PROPERTIES THAT NEED 

[Captioner] 21:12:43
TO BE REHABILITATED, THAT IS

[Captioner] 21:12:43
 THE 

[Captioner] 21:12:44
PICTURE THERE.

[Captioner] 21:12:46
PRODUCTION IS REALLY TIED TO THE 

[Captioner] 21:12:49
IDEA THAT TENANTS NEED OUTREACH 

[Captioner] 21:12:50
ENGAGEMENT EDUCATION IN ORDER TO 

[Captioner] 21:12:52
STAY SECURE IN THEIR HOMES.

[Captioner] 21:12:55
A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THE PROGRAM IS 

[Captioner] 21:12:57
THE AC HOUSING SECURE PROGRAM.

[Captioner] 21:12:59
AND THEN FLEXIBLE FUNDING ALLOWS 

[Captioner] 21:13:02
US TO DO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS.

[Captioner] 21:13:03
ALMOST EVERYTHING IS ELIGIBLE 

[Captioner] 21:13:06
THERE BUT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT 

[Captioner] 21:13:08
FOR US TO THINK ABOUT FIRST TIME 

[Captioner] 21:13:10
HOME BUYER PROGRAMS UNDER 

[Captioner] 21:13:12
FLEXIBILITY BECAUSE UNDER 

[Captioner] 21:13:14
REHABILITATE OR PRODUCTION 

[Captioner] 21:13:16
THERE'S A 55 YEAR REGULATORY 

[Captioner] 21:13:17
AGREEMENT.

[Captioner] 21:13:19
AND WE DON'T WANT TO NECESSARILY 

[Captioner] 21:13:21
HAVE 55 YEARS WITH HOME 

[Captioner] 21:13:22
OWNERSHIP.

[Captioner] 21:13:23
NEXT SLIDE PLEASE.

[Captioner] 21:13:28
WE HAVE BEEN DOING QUITE A BIT 

[Captioner] 21:13:29
OF COMMUNITY OUTREACH.

[Captioner] 21:13:30
THESE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS 

[Captioner] 21:13:32
THAT WE'VE DONE SO FAR.

[Captioner] 21:13:34
AND WE HAVE A HOUSING SUMMIT 

[Captioner] 21:13:36
COMING UP IN MID APRIL.

[Captioner] 21:13:39
NEXT SLIDE.

[Captioner] 21:13:41
SOME OF THE KEY TAKE AWAYS THAT 

[Captioner] 21:13:43
WE'VE HEARD BACK ADDRESS 

[Captioner] 21:13:43
 

[Captioner] 21:13:44
HOMELESSNESS.

[Captioner] 21:13:46
THAT WAS A NUMBER 1 THING IN 

[Captioner] 21:13:48
2016 BUT IT IS STILL THE NUMBER 

[Captioner] 21:13:48
1 ISSUE.

[Captioner] 21:13:50
DECORATING AND PRESERVING 

[Captioner] 21:13:52
AFFORDABLE HOUSING, FACILITATING 

[Captioner] 21:13:53
MORE LOW COST MARKET RATE 

[Captioner] 21:13:56
HOUSING, STABILIZING FAMILIES IN 

[Captioner] 21:13:57
CRISIS.

[Captioner] 21:13:58
THESE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS 

[Captioner] 21:14:00
THAT HAVE BEEN COMING OUT OF THE 

[Captioner] 21:14:01
MEETINGS THAT WE HAVE BEEN 

[Captioner] 21:14:02
HOLDING WITH THE COMMUNITY AND 

[Captioner] 21:14:05
WHICH WE ARE USING TO HELP SET 

[Captioner] 21:14:06
OUR STANDARDS AND OUR PRIORITIES 

[Captioner] 21:14:08
FOR WHEN WE ARE ACTUALLY GOING 

[Captioner] 21:14:10
TO BE MAKING RECOMMENDATIONS TO 

[Captioner] 21:14:11
THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS.

[Captioner] 21:14:15
NEXT SLIDE.

[Captioner] 21:14:19
THERE ARE A LOT OF QUESTIONS 

[Captioner] 21:14:22
THAT HAVE BEEN COMING BACK, AS 

[Captioner] 21:14:23
WELL.

[Captioner] 21:14:25
AND THE COMMUNITY MEMBERS ARE 

[Captioner] 21:14:27
ASKING US IF WE CAN PARTNER WITH 

[Captioner] 21:14:29
SCHOOL DISTRICTS, CAN WE LOOK AT 

[Captioner] 21:14:32
THE COUNTY PROPERTY OUT IN 

[Captioner] 21:14:35
PLEASANTON WHERE THE FAIRGROUNDS 

[Captioner] 21:14:38
ARE, THEY ARE ASKING US TO FIND 

[Captioner] 21:14:40
WAYS TO SUPPORT SENIORS WHO ARE 

[Captioner] 21:14:42
ON FIXED INCOMES AND MAYBE CAN 

[Captioner] 21:14:45
NOTE AFFORD TO PAY FOR THE 

[Captioner] 21:14:46
BOND.

[Captioner] 21:14:48
AND THEN THEY ARE ALSO ASKING IF 

[Captioner] 21:14:49
THERE ARE OTHER ALTERNATIVES TO 

[Captioner] 21:14:50
NEW CONSTRUCTION.

[Captioner] 21:14:52
SO THESE ARE SORT OF THINGS THAT 

[Captioner] 21:14:54
WE HAVE BEEN HEARING ABOUT, AS 

[Captioner] 21:14:58
WE GO OUT, ANOTHER ONE THAT'S 

[Captioner] 21:15:02
REAL CRITICAL IS AIRBNBS AND

[Captioner] 21:15:03
 

[Captioner] 21:15:05
VACATION RENTALS ARE TAKING AWAY 

[Captioner] 21:15:07
STOCK AND MAKING THE HOUSING 

[Captioner] 21:15:08
CRISIS WORSE.

[Captioner] 21:15:09
NEXT SLIDE.

[Captioner] 21:15:12
THE HOUSING NEEDS SURVEY WILL 

[Captioner] 21:15:14
REMAIN ONLINE, WE ARE ASKING 

[Captioner] 21:15:16
FOLKS TO GO AHEAD AND SUBMIT 

[Captioner] 21:15:18
THEIR INFORMATION BECAUSE WE'RE 

[Captioner] 21:15:20
TAKING ALL OF THAT INTO 

[Captioner] 21:15:21
CONSIDERATION.

[Captioner] 21:15:23
WE'LL BE PRESENTING A HOUSING 

[Captioner] 21:15:25
PLAN THIS SUMMER TO THE BOARD OF 

[Captioner] 21:15:26
SUPERVISORS AND THERE WILL BE A 

[Captioner] 21:15:27
PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD AND WE 

[Captioner] 21:15:29
WILL BE ASKING FOR FOLKS TO 

[Captioner] 21:15:31
SUBMIT FORMAL COMMENTS DURING 

[Captioner] 21:15:33
THAT PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD.

[Captioner] 21:15:37
NEXT SLIDE.

[Captioner] 21:15:43
THE CONVEY WHICH IS DIFFERENT 

[Captioner] 21:15:45
THAN THE COMMUNITY MEETINGS HAS 

[Captioner] 21:15:48
HAD A SIMILAR BUT LITTLE BIT 

[Captioner] 21:15:49
DIFFERENT FEEDBACK.

[Captioner] 21:15:51
HOUSING STILL REMAINS NUMBER 1 

[Captioner] 21:15:54
AND CREATING LOW INCOME HOUSING 

[Captioner] 21:15:56
IS STILL NUMBER 2 BUT THEY ARE 

[Captioner] 21:15:57
ALSO ASKING THAT THEY CREATE 

[Captioner] 21:15:59
MORE LOW INCOME HOUSING IN 

[Captioner] 21:16:01
HIGHER RESOURCED COMMUNITIES, 

[Captioner] 21:16:03
 

[Captioner] 21:16:06
BETTER SCHOOL DISTRICTS, BETTER 

[Captioner] 21:16:07
SLOPPING AND ACCESS TO 

[Captioner] 21:16:08
TRANSPORTATION.

[Captioner] 21:16:11
LOW INCOME HOUSING FOR 

[Captioner] 21:16:13
COMMUNITIES AT RISK OF 

[Captioner] 21:16:13
DISPLACEMENT.

[Captioner] 21:16:15
THESE ARE AURAL THINGS WE'RE 

[Captioner] 21:16:16
HEARING FROM THE COMMUNITY.

[Captioner] 21:16:16
NEXT SLIDE.

[Captioner] 21:16:22
WE'RE ALSO HEARING A LOT ABOUT 

[Captioner] 21:16:25
WHAT ARE SOME OF THE ISSUES 

[Captioner] 21:16:29
FACING THE COMMUNITY'S 

[Captioner] 21:16:29
FAMILIES.

[Captioner] 21:16:30
SO RENTS ARE INCREASING FASTER 

[Captioner] 21:16:31
THAN INCOME.

[Captioner] 21:16:34
THERE'S RISK OF LOSING A HOME 

[Captioner] 21:16:38
DUE TO FORECLOSURE.

[Captioner] 21:16:41
NOT BEING ABLE TO AFFORD THE 

[Captioner] 21:16:41
COMMUNITY.

[Captioner] 21:16:43
THERE IS A LOT OF CONCERNS ABOUT 

[Captioner] 21:16:47
BEING RELOCATING OUTSIDE OF THE 

[Captioner] 21:16:51
BAY AREA TO LOWER COST AREAS.

[Captioner] 21:16:53
AND THE DIFFICULTY OR INABILITY 

[Captioner] 21:16:55
TO FIND HOUSING IS ALSO ONE OF 

[Captioner] 21:16:56
THOSE THINGS THAT CONTINUE TO 

[Captioner] 21:16:57
COME UP.

[Captioner] 21:16:59
NEXT SLIDE.

[Captioner] 21:17:00
EXCUSE ME.

[Captioner] 21:17:02
I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY 

[Captioner] 21:17:03
QUESTIONS.

[Captioner] 21:17:07
AND JUST LET YOU KNOW THAT THE 

[Captioner] 21:17:08
BALLOT MEASURE WILL BE PLACED ON 

[Captioner] 21:17:10
THE BALLOT BY THE BAY AREA 

[Captioner] 21:17:11
FINANCE AGENCY THIS SUMMER.

[Captioner] 21:17:13
AND IT WILL BE DECIDED ABOUT 

[Captioner] 21:17:16
WHETHER IT WILL BE A TEN OR A 

[Captioner] 21:17:19
$20 BILLION BOND BEFORE IT'S 

[Captioner] 21:17:20
PLACED ON THE BALLOT.

[Captioner] 21:17:21

AFFORDABLE, WHAT IS AFFORDABLE?

[Captioner] 21:19:49
AFFORDABLE IS SOMETHING THAT 

[Captioner] 21:19:51
PEOPLE CANNOT AFFORD.

[Captioner] 21:19:52
AFFORDABLE ARE TIME.

[Captioner] 21:19:54
PEOPLE ARE DYING AND THERE IS NO 

[Captioner] 21:19:55

[Captioner] 21:19:57
AFFORDABLE IS SOMETHING THAT 

[Captioner] 21:19:59
PEOPLE WANT, BUT CANNOT GET.

[Captioner] 21:20:02
NOW YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT $10 

[Captioner] 21:20:06

 DELAYING, 

[Captioner] 21:20:25
DELAYING, DELAYING, THAT 

[Captioner] 21:20:26
AFFORDABILITY OF THOSE PEOPLE

BEFORE THE COUNCIL ENGAGES IN

QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS.

[Captioner] 21:21:06
THIS COULD BE A BALLOT MEASURE 

[Captioner] 21:21:08
ON THE NEXT ELECTION CYCLE AND 

[Captioner] 21:21:10
THIS INFORMATION IT IS JUST AN 

[Captioner] 21:21:12
INFORMATIONAL ITEM WHERE YOU CAN 

[Captioner] 21:21:12
ASK QUESTIONS.

[Captioner] 21:21:16
IF THE COUNCIL IS INTERESTED IN 

[Captioner] 21:21:18
EXPRESSING A POSITION ON BALLOT 

[Captioner] 21:21:20
MEASURES WHETHER IT IS THIS 

[Captioner] 21:21:22

WE ARE NOT MAKING A VOTE IN 

[Captioner] 21:22:01

[Captioner] 21:22:04

[Captioner] 21:22:15
THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 21:22:15
>> Councilmember Cox:   THANK 

[Captioner] 21:22:16
YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR 

[Captioner] 21:22:17
PRESENTATION.

[Captioner] 21:22:19
I WAS THERE BACK IN JANUARY WHEN 

[Captioner] 21:22:21
YOU DID IT AT OUR PUBLIC LIBRARY 

[Captioner] 21:22:23
AND THANK YOU FOR DOING IT IN 

[Captioner] 21:22:24
FREMONT FOR SOME OF US THAT 

[Captioner] 21:22:25
DON'T HAVE TO TRAVEL FAR.

[Captioner] 21:22:27
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I REALLY 

[Captioner] 21:22:30
WOULD LIKE TO UNDERSTAND IS, ALL 

[Captioner] 21:22:34
OF YOUR BOND FUNDING AND 

[Captioner] 21:22:36
ALLOCATION AND YOUR FORMULA AND 

[Captioner] 21:22:38
KIND OF UNDERSTANDING LIKE WHERE 

[Captioner] 21:22:39
ARE YOUR INFORMATION COMING 

[Captioner] 21:22:42
THERE, WHAT TIME PERIOD?

[Captioner] 21:22:46
AND THEN HOW WAS IT DECIDED 

[Captioner] 21:22:47
THAT, YOU KNOW, CERTAIN CITIES 

[Captioner] 21:22:49
WOULD GET MORE THAN OTHERS.

[Captioner] 21:22:51
JUST SO THAT I CAN KIND OF 

[Captioner] 21:22:51
UNDERSTAND THAT.

[Captioner] 21:22:53
AND IF THERE ARE THINGS THAT ARE 

[Captioner] 21:22:55
GOING TO CHANGE WOULD THAT ALSO 

[Captioner] 21:22:57
BE DISCLOSED BY THE JUNE DATE 

[Captioner] 21:22:59
THAT YOU REFERENCE BEFORE IT 

[Captioner] 21:23:00
GOES ON THE BALLOT?

[Captioner] 21:23:02
SO COULD YOU HELP ME UNDERSTAND 

[Captioner] 21:23:04
THOSE PIECES?

[Captioner] 21:23:04
>> SURE.

[Captioner] 21:23:07
AND AGAIN PIELINGS.

[Captioner] 21:23:13
 I APOLOGIZE.

[Captioner] 21:23:18
I THINK MY VOICE IS A BIT

[Captioner] 21:23:18
 BETTER 

[Captioner] 21:23:19
NOW.

[Captioner] 21:23:21
WHAT I PUT ON THE SLIDE WERE 

[Captioner] 21:23:24
THREE THIS ONE THIS ONE OR THIS 

[Captioner] 21:23:25
ONE METHODOLOGIES.

[Captioner] 21:23:26
THE FIRST ONE WAS RETURN TO 

[Captioner] 21:23:27
SOURCE.

[Captioner] 21:23:29
RETURN TO SOURCE IS BASICALLY WE 

[Captioner] 21:23:30
LOOKED AT THE PROPERTY TAX 

[Captioner] 21:23:31
REVENUE THAT WAS COMING FROM 

[Captioner] 21:23:32
EACH OF THE CITIES.

[Captioner] 21:23:34
AND THE UNINCORPORATED COUNTY, 

[Captioner] 21:23:37
ADDED IT UP AND KNOWN WE 

[Captioner] 21:23:38
ESSENTIALLY ALLOCATED A 

[Captioner] 21:23:40
PERCENTAGE TO WHAT WAS BROUGHT 

[Captioner] 21:23:40
IN.

[Captioner] 21:23:42
AND THAT IS THE PERCENTAGE THAT 

[Captioner] 21:23:44
WOULD BE ASSIGNED TO A CITY IN 

[Captioner] 21:23:46
RETURN TO SOURCE.

[Captioner] 21:23:48
SO IT IS BASED ON WHAT PROPERTY 

[Captioner] 21:23:49
TAX REVENUES YOU'RE GENERATING 

[Captioner] 21:23:50
NOW.

[Captioner] 21:23:53
THE SECOND ONE WAS THE RAN 

[Captioner] 21:23:57
 RHNA 

[Captioner] 21:23:58
NUMBERS.

[Captioner] 21:24:00
THE RHNA NUMBERS THAT THE CITY 

[Captioner] 21:24:03
WAS AWARDED IN THE LAST HOUSING 

[Captioner] 21:24:05
MR. PRESIDENT CYCLE AND WE THEN 

[Captioner] 21:24:06
CREATED A PERCENTAGE BASED ON 

[Captioner] 21:24:09
THAT PERCENTAGE OF THE ENTIRE 

[Captioner] 21:24:11
RHNA TO THE ENTIRE COUNTY AND 

[Captioner] 21:24:13
THEN ALLOCATED IT TO EACH H EACH 

[Captioner] 21:24:13
CITY.

[Captioner] 21:24:15
AND THE LAST ONE WAS POVERTY.

[Captioner] 21:24:16
WE LOOKED AT WHAT THE TOTAL 

[Captioner] 21:24:18
POVERTY NUMBER WAS FOR THE 

[Captioner] 21:24:19
ENTIRE COUNTY AND WE LOOKED AT 

[Captioner] 21:24:22
WHAT EACH CITY'S POVERTY RATES 

[Captioner] 21:24:23
WERE AND ALLOCATED DOWN BY THAT 

[Captioner] 21:24:24
PERCENTAGE.

[Captioner] 21:24:26
SO THOSE ARE THE THREE 

[Captioner] 21:24:29
METHODOLOGIES, THAT ESSENTIALLY 

[Captioner] 21:24:32
THE BAY AREA HOUSING FINANCE 

[Captioner] 21:24:32
AGENCY IS USING IN THEIR 

[Captioner] 21:24:34
DISCUSSIONS WITH THE COUNTIES.

[Captioner] 21:24:36
AND SO THOSE WERE THE EXAMPLES 

[Captioner] 21:24:37
THAT WE INCLUDED.

[Captioner] 21:24:40
THOSE ARE NOT THE ONLY EXAMPLES, 

[Captioner] 21:24:44
FOR INSTANCE MEASUREA 1 USED THE 

[Captioner] 21:24:47
HOMELESS POINT IN TIME COUNT AND 

[Captioner] 21:24:47
POPULATION.

[Captioner] 21:24:49
SO THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT 

[Captioner] 21:24:52
TYPES AND I WANTED TO SHARE WHAT 

[Captioner] 21:24:54
BAFA HAD BEEN ACCRUING.

[Captioner] 21:24:56
AND YOU KNOW HONESTLY IT MIGHT 

[Captioner] 21:24:58
END UP BEING A MIXTURE OF TWO OF 

[Captioner] 21:24:59
THEM.

[Captioner] 21:25:01
BUT WE THINK AND WHAT MY AS THE 

[Captioner] 21:25:02
HOUSING DIRECTOR MY 

[Captioner] 21:25:03
RECOMMENDATION TO THE BOARD OF 

[Captioner] 21:25:05
SUPERVISORS WILL BE THAT WE TAKE 

[Captioner] 21:25:07
THE PRODUCTION MONEY THAT 52% OF 

[Captioner] 21:25:09
THE FULL BOND, AND WE ALLOCATE 

[Captioner] 21:25:10
IT DOWN TO CITIES.

[Captioner] 21:25:13
BECAUSE CITIES, CITIES REALLY DO 

[Captioner] 21:25:14
NEED TO KNOW WHAT TOE PLAN OR 

[Captioner] 21:25:19
 TO PLAN FOR.

[Captioner] 21:25:20
EVERY LOCAL GOVERNMENT WILL NEED 

[Captioner] 21:25:23
TO BUILD HOUSING AND WE WANT TO 

[Captioner] 21:25:25
HAVE YOU HAVE A STRONG SENSE AND 

[Captioner] 21:25:26
A KNOWLEDGE OF HOW MUCH WILL BE 

[Captioner] 21:25:27
COMING.

[Captioner] 21:25:29
OUR EXPENDITURE PLAN WILL BE DUE 

[Captioner] 21:25:31
TO THE BAY AREA HOUSING FINANCE 

[Captioner] 21:25:33
AGENCY 90 DAYS AFTER THE BOND 

[Captioner] 21:25:34
PASSES IF IT PASSES.

[Captioner] 21:25:36
SO WE WILL HAVE UNTIL FEBRUARY 

[Captioner] 21:25:39
5th OF 2025 TO FINALIZE ALL OF 

[Captioner] 21:25:44
THESE

[Captioner] 21:25:45
 DECISIONS.

[Captioner] 21:25:46
>> Councilmember Cox:   OKAY, I 

[Captioner] 21:25:48
WAS WONDERING AS EVERYONE DOES 

[Captioner] 21:25:50
THE POINT IN COUNT.

[Captioner] 21:25:52
IF THERE IS A HIRE PERCENTAGE WE 

[Captioner] 21:25:55
MIGHT BE A SMALLER CITY HERE IN 

[Captioner] 21:25:58
FREMONT COMPARED TO THE OTHER 

[Captioner] 21:26:00
CITIES BUT IF WE HAVE A HIGHER 

[Captioner] 21:26:02
NUMBER OF UNHOUSED OR HOMELESS I 

[Captioner] 21:26:04
WOULD LOOK TO SEE HOW THAT COULD 

[Captioner] 21:26:06
BE ADJUSTED FOR US BECAUSE OUR 

[Captioner] 21:26:08
COUNT IS AT A HIGHER BASED ON 

[Captioner] 21:26:09
THE POPULATION THAT WAS COUNTED 

[Captioner] 21:26:13
AND WHERE WAS WHERE WOULD THAT

[Captioner] 21:26:14
 

[Captioner] 21:26:15
ADJUSTMENT OCCUR.

[Captioner] 21:26:17
THAT IS WHERE I'M KIND OF 

[Captioner] 21:26:18
LOOKING TO YOU AS YOU ARE 

[Captioner] 21:26:20
PUTTING THIS TOGETHER INFORM THE 

[Captioner] 21:26:21
BOND MEASURE HOW THAT WOULD BE 

[Captioner] 21:26:23
PART OF THE THOUGHT PROCESS.

[Captioner] 21:26:26
>> THE FINAL POINT IN TIME COUNT 

[Captioner] 21:26:27
NUMBERS WILL BE COMING UP IN THE 

[Captioner] 21:26:29
NEXT 60 DAYS OR SO MAYBE SOONER 

[Captioner] 21:26:31
AND WE WILL GET A COUNTY WIDE 

[Captioner] 21:26:33
NUMBER AND GETTING NUMBERS FOR 

[Captioner] 21:26:33
EACH OF THE CITIES.

[Captioner] 21:26:35
SO WE COULD ACTUALLY ACCRUES 

[Captioner] 21:26:36
THAT PERCENTAGE, THE SAME 

[Captioner] 21:26:38
METHODOLOGY TO COME UP WITH THE 

[Captioner] 21:26:40
PERCENTAGE BY CITY.

[Captioner] 21:26:42
I DON'T NECESSARILY THINK IT 

[Captioner] 21:26:44
MAKES ZONES TO DO IT ONLY BY -- 

[Captioner] 21:26:46
SENSE TO DO IT ENBY HOMELESS 

[Captioner] 21:26:47
COUNT.

[Captioner] 21:26:50
 FOR INSTANCE UNDER MEASURE A 

[Captioner] 21:26:52
WHUN IT WAS A MIX OF HOMELESS 

[Captioner] 21:26:54
COUNT AND POVERTY RATES TO GET 

[Captioner] 21:26:55
TO THE REGIONAL POOL.

[Captioner] 21:26:57
THERE WAS A SOUTH COUNTY POOL 

[Captioner] 21:26:59
AND IT, YOU KNOW, IT WAS SIZED 

[Captioner] 21:27:03
BY THE POVERTY RATES AND THE 

[Captioner] 21:27:06
HOMELESS COUNT IN FREMONT UNION 

[Captioner] 21:27:09
CITY AND NEWARK AS OPPOSED TO 

[Captioner] 21:27:11
MID COUNTY HAYWARD, SAN LEANDRO 

[Captioner] 21:27:13
UNINCORPORATED COUNTY AND EAST 

[Captioner] 21:27:14
COUNTY, ET CETERA.

[Captioner] 21:27:16
SO THAT'S HOW THOSE POOLS WERE 

[Captioner] 21:27:16
ESTABLISHED.

[Captioner] 21:27:18
WHICH WAS DIFFERENT THAN THE 

[Captioner] 21:27:19
BASE CITY ALLOCATION.

[Captioner] 21:27:20
>> Councilmember Cox:   I SEE.

[Captioner] 21:27:22
AND WHAT IS THE PERCENTAGE 

[Captioner] 21:27:23
NUMBER THAT IN ORDER FOR THE 

[Captioner] 21:27:26
BOND TO PASS?

[Captioner] 21:27:29
>> SO RIGHT NOW, 67% IS REQUIRED 

[Captioner] 21:27:31
IN ORDER TOE PASS ANY NEW TAX.

[Captioner] 21:27:34
AND ANY NEW GENERAL OBLIGATION 

[Captioner] 21:27:35
BOND .

[Captioner] 21:27:37
THERE IS A CANYON CONSTITUTIONAL 

[Captioner] 21:27:39
AMENDMENT THAT WILL BE ON THE 

[Captioner] 21:27:42
BALLOT AS WELL NEXT YEAR WHICH 

[Captioner] 21:27:45
IS BOTH FOR HOUSING GENERAL 

[Captioner] 21:27:47
OBLIGATION BUT ALSO 

[Captioner] 21:27:48
INFRASTRUCTURE BONDS.

[Captioner] 21:27:49
AND IT IS SIMILAR TO WHAT 

[Captioner] 21:27:51
HAPPENED IN THE 1990s AROUND 

[Captioner] 21:27:54
SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN WHICH WE AND 

[Captioner] 21:27:57
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA LOWERED 

[Captioner] 21:27:59
THE PERCENTAGE THAT IS NEEDED TO 

[Captioner] 21:28:01
PASS A SCHOOL BOND FROM 67% DOWN 

[Captioner] 21:28:03
TOE 55%.

[Captioner] 21:28:05
SO AT THE SAME POINT IN TIME 

[Captioner] 21:28:07
THAT WE ARE IN THIS HOUSING 

[Captioner] 21:28:08
CRISIS THERE IS ALSO A GREAT 

[Captioner] 21:28:10
NEED FOR INFRASTRUCTURE 

[Captioner] 21:28:10
IMPROVEMENTS.

[Captioner] 21:28:12
WE HAVE AGING ROADS, WE HAVE 

[Captioner] 21:28:13
AGING SEWERS.

[Captioner] 21:28:18
SO THE IDEA WAS TO REDUCE THE

[Captioner] 21:28:19
 

[Captioner] 21:28:20
CONSTITUTIONAL REQUIREMENT FROM 

[Captioner] 21:28:22
67% TO 55%.

[Captioner] 21:28:23
THAT WILL REQUIRE A VOTE OF THE 

[Captioner] 21:28:24
PEOPLE.

[Captioner] 21:28:25
AND SO IT WILL BE ON THE BALLOT 

[Captioner] 21:28:26
AS WELL.

[Captioner] 21:28:29
THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS, YOU 

[Captioner] 21:28:30
KNOW, IT IS LOOKED AT AS A 

[Captioner] 21:28:32
COMPANION PIECE BUT IT IS A 

[Captioner] 21:28:34
DIFFERENT GROUP OF FOLKS THAT 

[Captioner] 21:28:36
PUT THAT ON THE BALLOT.

[Captioner] 21:28:37
>> Councilmember Cox:   OKAY SO 

[Captioner] 21:28:39
WE WOULD HAVE TOE STICK WITH THE 

[Captioner] 21:28:41
67 AT THE TIME OF THE VOTING IN 

[Captioner] 21:28:44
NOVEMBER 2024 OR IF IT CHANGES 

[Captioner] 21:28:46
AND APPROVES DOES IT BECOME 

[Captioner] 21:28:49
EFFECTIVE FOR THE BALLOTS AT 

[Captioner] 21:28:50
NOVEMBER?

[Captioner] 21:28:51
>> THAT'S A REALLY GOOD 

[Captioner] 21:28:51
QUESTION.

[Captioner] 21:28:53
AND THERE ARE SEVERAL OTHER 

[Captioner] 21:28:54
ISSUES THAT ARE AT PLAY.

[Captioner] 21:28:57
HOWEVER, I BELIEVE THAT THE WAY 

[Captioner] 21:29:00
ACA 1, THE CONSTITUTIONAL 

[Captioner] 21:29:01
AMENDMENT IS WRITTEN, IS THAT IT 

[Captioner] 21:29:04
WOULD APPLY TO ALL MEASURES ON 

[Captioner] 21:29:07
THE BALLOT IN 2024.

[Captioner] 21:29:07
>> Councilmember Cox:   OKAY SO 

[Captioner] 21:29:09
IT WOULD TAKE --

[Captioner] 21:29:11
>> IT IS WRITTEN TO AFFECT THIS 

[Captioner] 21:29:12
AS WELL AS SOME INFRASTRUCTURE 

[Captioner] 21:29:13
BILLS THAT ARE OWN THE BALLOT 

[Captioner] 21:29:15
TOO.

[Captioner] 21:29:16
>> Councilmember Cox:   OKAY SO 

[Captioner] 21:29:17
THAT'S GOOD TO KNOW.

[Captioner] 21:29:20
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

[Captioner] 21:29:22
>> YOU'RE WELCOME.

[Captioner] 21:29:24
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 21:29:26
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN, CLARIFYING 

[Captioner] 21:29:27
QUESTIONS.

[Captioner] 21:29:27
>> Councilmember Salwan:   THANK 

[Captioner] 21:29:28
YOU.

[Captioner] 21:29:30
I DO HAVE THE CHANCE TO HEAR THE 

[Captioner] 21:29:31
LONGER PRESENTATION AT THE 

[Captioner] 21:29:34
LIBRARY SO IT WAS VERY HELPFUL.

[Captioner] 21:29:35
JUST WANT TO MENTION A FEW 

[Captioner] 21:29:38
THINGS, GEOGRAPHIC EQUITY, YOU 

[Captioner] 21:29:39
KNOW, CITY OF FREMONT WE ALWAYS 

[Captioner] 21:29:42
FEEL WE PAY A LOT MORE TAXES AND 

[Captioner] 21:29:44
WE NEVER GET THE PERCENTAGE 

[Captioner] 21:29:44
BACK.

[Captioner] 21:29:46
SO WE WOE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT 

[Captioner] 21:29:48
MONEY COMING FROM FREMONT IS 

[Captioner] 21:29:50
COMING BACK TOE FREMONT NOT 

[Captioner] 21:29:52
SUCKED UP BY OAKLAND, THE BIG 

[Captioner] 21:29:53
MOAN SISTER.

[Captioner] 21:29:55
SO HOPEFULLY WE CAN GET SOME OF 

[Captioner] 21:29:56
THAT FUNDING BACK.

[Captioner] 21:29:57
AND ALSO I HAD MENTIONED ABOUT 

[Captioner] 21:30:00
PRESERVING EXISTING FUNDING, I 

[Captioner] 21:30:01
THINK THAT'S A HUGE OPPORTUNITY, 

[Captioner] 21:30:03
YOU KNOW, INSTEAD OF ALLOWING 

[Captioner] 21:30:05
CURRENT RESIDENTIAL PLACES TO 

[Captioner] 21:30:06
GET TURNED OVER.

[Captioner] 21:30:09
THAT CAUSES A LOT OF ISSUES.

[Captioner] 21:30:11
AND THEN SHELTER HOUSING, I 

[Captioner] 21:30:13
THINK THAT'S A HUGE UNTAPPED 

[Captioner] 21:30:15
OPPORTUNITY.

[Captioner] 21:30:17
YOU KNOW, TAKES A LONG TIME TO 

[Captioner] 21:30:18
BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING, WE 

[Captioner] 21:30:20
NEED SOME INTERIM PLACES WHERE 

[Captioner] 21:30:22
WE CAN PUT PEOPLE GET THEM OUT 

[Captioner] 21:30:24
OF THE STREETS AND GET THEM OUT 

[Captioner] 21:30:24
OF THE PARKS.

[Captioner] 21:30:26
SO I THINK AS A COUNTY WE HAVE 

[Captioner] 21:30:27
TO LOOK ATS TO KIND OF PLACES 

[Captioner] 21:30:29
WHERE WE CAN GET PEOPLE HOUSED 

[Captioner] 21:30:32
FOR THE NIGHT AND GET THEM 

[Captioner] 21:30:34
PATHED TOWARDS A PERMANENT 

[Captioner] 21:30:34
HOME.

[Captioner] 21:30:37
I THINK THAT'S A HUGE VOID AS OF 

[Captioner] 21:30:38
NOW.

[Captioner] 21:30:40
AND THEN MIDDLE CLASS HOUSING WE 

[Captioner] 21:30:42
HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO GET ANY 

[Captioner] 21:30:43
MIDDLE CLASS HOUSING IN THE CITY 

[Captioner] 21:30:44
OF FREMONT.

[Captioner] 21:30:46
THE LOW AND EXTREMELY LOW, GETS 

[Captioner] 21:30:49
DONE, UPPER INCOME GETS DONE BUT 

[Captioner] 21:30:51
THE MIDDLE CLASS FOR SOME REASON 

[Captioner] 21:30:53
THE MARKET DOESN'T SUPPORT, 

[Captioner] 21:30:54
THERE IS NO PROGRAMS THAT 

[Captioner] 21:30:56
SUPPORT THAT, AND IT WOULD BE 

[Captioner] 21:30:58
NICE TO GET MIDDLE INCOME 

[Captioner] 21:31:00
HOUSING.

[Captioner] 21:31:01
THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 21:31:02
>> THANK YOU WE'LL TAKE THOSE 

[Captioner] 21:31:04
NOTES BACK WITH US.

[Captioner] 21:31:06
>> Mayor Mei:   CLARIFY 

[Captioner] 21:31:07
COMMENTS, COUNCILMEMBER 

[Captioner] 21:31:07
CAMPBELL.

[Captioner] 21:31:08
>> Councilmember Campbell:   

[Captioner] 21:31:08
EXCUSE ME.

[Captioner] 21:31:11
THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION.

[Captioner] 21:31:12
IT'S GOOD TO HEAR THAT THE POINT 

[Captioner] 21:31:15
IN TIME COUNT IS GOING TO BE 

[Captioner] 21:31:16
COMING OUT SOON.

[Captioner] 21:31:17
BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S GOING TO 

[Captioner] 21:31:18
BE REALLY, REALLY IMPORTANT FOR 

[Captioner] 21:31:23
US, AS A CITY,

[Captioner] 21:31:24
 TO BE ABLE TO 

[Captioner] 21:31:24
SEE.

[Captioner] 21:31:27
I WAS WONDERING ABOUT SOME OF 

[Captioner] 21:31:29
OUR NEIGHBORING CITIES RECEIVED 

[Captioner] 21:31:32
SOME PROJECT HOMEKEY MONEY AND 

[Captioner] 21:31:33
UNFORTUNATELY WE DID NOT GET 

[Captioner] 21:31:34
THAT.

[Captioner] 21:31:36
WOULD THAT PROHIBIT US FROM -- 

[Captioner] 21:31:39
OR WOULD THAT PLAY IN AS A 

[Captioner] 21:31:41
FACTOR FOR US TO BE ABLE TO 

[Captioner] 21:31:43
PERHAPS RECEIVE SOME FUNDING FOR 

[Captioner] 21:31:47
THAT KIND OF HOUSING?

[Captioner] 21:31:47
>> YES.

[Captioner] 21:31:50
I BELIEVE THAT WHEN AN 

[Captioner] 21:31:51
ALLOCATION IS MADE DOWN TO THE 

[Captioner] 21:31:53
CITY IT WILL BE UP TO YOU TO 

[Captioner] 21:31:54
DECIDE HOW YOU WANT TO 

[Captioner] 21:31:58
PRIORITIZE THE FUNDS TOAB 

[Captioner] 21:31:58
SPENT.

[Captioner] 21:32:01
THE BAFA RULE IS THAT YOU MUST 

[Captioner] 21:32:03
USE THE FUNDING TO FURTHER YOUR 

[Captioner] 21:32:04
REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS 

[Captioner] 21:32:06
ASSIGNMENT, ASSESSMENT NUMBERS, 

[Captioner] 21:32:08
AND SO HOWEVER YOU WANT TO BUILD 

[Captioner] 21:32:10
AND WHATEVER YOU WANT TO 

[Captioner] 21:32:12
PRIORITIZE WILL BE UP TO THE 

[Captioner] 21:32:14
CITY COUNCIL OF FREMONT TO SPEND 

[Captioner] 21:32:15
THE MONEY THAT IS ALLOCATED TO 

[Captioner] 21:32:15
YOU.

[Captioner] 21:32:15
>> Councilmember Campbell:   I 

[Captioner] 21:32:16
SEE.

[Captioner] 21:32:20
AND THEN YOU MENTIONED THERE WAS 

[Captioner] 21:32:24
A POOL OF MISCELLANEOUS FUNDS.

[Captioner] 21:32:25
>> THERE IS SOMETHING CALLED 

[Captioner] 21:32:27
FLEXIBLE FUNDS.

[Captioner] 21:32:27
>> Councilmember Campbell:   

[Captioner] 21:32:29
FLEXIBLE, OKAY.

[Captioner] 21:32:31
>> HOME OWNERSHIP HOUSING AND 

[Captioner] 21:32:35
BOTH PRESERVATION AND FIRST TIME 

[Captioner] 21:32:37
HOME BUYER PROGRAMS, THOSE ARE 

[Captioner] 21:32:37
THE TYPES OF THINGS THAT WOULD 

[Captioner] 21:32:37
BE BEST SERVED UNDER THAT 

[Captioner] 21:32:38
PROGRAM.

[Captioner] 21:32:40
BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE A 

[Captioner] 21:32:41
REGULATORY REQUIREMENT ATTACHED 

[Captioner] 21:32:42
TO IT.

[Captioner] 21:32:43
ADDITIONALLY, WE'RE REALLY 

[Captioner] 21:32:46
LOOKING AT ACCESSORY DWELLING 

[Captioner] 21:32:47
UNIT LOAN PROGRAMS BECAUSE ONE 

[Captioner] 21:32:49
OF THE THINGS THAT OUR TECHNICAL 

[Captioner] 21:32:51
ASSISTANCE PROGRAM HAS FOUND IS 

[Captioner] 21:32:53
THAT A SENIOR ON FIXED INCOME 

[Captioner] 21:32:56
WHO MIGHT WANT TO BUILD AN 

[Captioner] 21:32:58
ACCESSORY DWELLING UNIT NO 

[Captioner] 21:32:59
LONGER QUALIFIES FOR A LOAN 

[Captioner] 21:33:00
BECAUSE THEY ARE NO LONGER 

[Captioner] 21:33:02
WORKING AND NOW ON A FIXED 

[Captioner] 21:33:02
INCOME.

[Captioner] 21:33:05
SO EVEN THOUGH THAT ACCESSORY 

[Captioner] 21:33:06
DWELLING UNIT WOULD MAKE THEM 

[Captioner] 21:33:08
MORE SECURE FINANCIALLY BECAUSE 

[Captioner] 21:33:09
THEY COULD RENT THE UNIT OUT IT 

[Captioner] 21:33:11
IS NOT SOMETHING THAT THEY COULD 

[Captioner] 21:33:12
GET ACCESS TO.

[Captioner] 21:33:13
SO WE HAVE BEEN CONTEMPLATING 

[Captioner] 21:33:16
THE CREATION OF A COUNTY WIDE 

[Captioner] 21:33:18
ACCESSORY DWELLING UNIT LOAN 

[Captioner] 21:33:18
PROGRAM.

[Captioner] 21:33:19
THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS 

[Captioner] 21:33:21
THAT WE EXPECT TO FALL UNDER 

[Captioner] 21:33:22
THAT PROGRAM.

[Captioner] 21:33:22
>> Councilmember Campbell:   I 

[Captioner] 21:33:24
SEE.

[Captioner] 21:33:27
SO ABATING ENCAMPMENTS WOULD NOT 

[Captioner] 21:33:29
BE SOMETHING THAT THE FLEXIBLE 

[Captioner] 21:33:31
SPENDING COULD BE USED FOR?

[Captioner] 21:33:32
>> WELL, ALL OF THE GENERAL 

[Captioner] 21:33:34
OBLIGATION FUNDS MUST BE AN 

[Captioner] 21:33:36
INVESTMENT IN REAL PROPERTY.

[Captioner] 21:33:37
IT IS AGAIN STICKS AND BRICKS 

[Captioner] 21:33:39
FOR THE MOST PART.

[Captioner] 21:33:42
SO WE'RE NOT ALLOWED TO FUND 

[Captioner] 21:33:42
SERVICES.

[Captioner] 21:33:45
BUILDING HOUSING THAT WE COULD 

[Captioner] 21:33:46
MOVE PEOPLE FROM AN ENCAMPMENT 

[Captioner] 21:33:49
INTO IS AN ALLOWABLE USE BUT THE 

[Captioner] 21:33:51
SERVICES REQUIRED AND THE 

[Captioner] 21:33:54
CLEANUP OF THE ACTUAL SITE 

[Captioner] 21:33:56
ITSELF ONCE FOLKS ARE HOUSED IS 

[Captioner] 21:33:58
NOTE AN ELIGIBLE USE.

[Captioner] 21:33:58
>> Councilmember Campbell:   

[Captioner] 21:33:59
THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 21:34:00
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 21:34:02
NEXT IS COUNCILMEMBER KENG 

[Captioner] 21:34:04
PLEASE.

[Captioner] 21:34:04
>> Councilmember Keng:   THANK 

[Captioner] 21:34:05
YOU MAYOR.

[Captioner] 21:34:07
I'D LIKE TO SEE, AS MENTIONED 

[Captioner] 21:34:10
EARLIER BY SOME OF MY 

[Captioner] 21:34:12
COLLEAGUES, I ALSO ECHO THE 

[Captioner] 21:34:13
SENTIMENT WHERE TREATMENT IS ONE 

[Captioner] 21:34:15
OF THE -- WE'RE THE SECOND 

[Captioner] 21:34:17
LARGEST CITY IN OUR COUNTY AND 

[Captioner] 21:34:19
WE DO ALSO, YOU KNOW, NEED TO 

[Captioner] 21:34:21
SEE OUR MONEY THAT'S CLOACTED 

[Captioner] 21:34:22
FROM OUR PROPERTY TAXES RETURNED 

[Captioner] 21:34:24
TO OUR CITY.

[Captioner] 21:34:25
ESPECIALLY SEEING OUR INCREASING 

[Captioner] 21:34:27
HOMELESS COUNT.

[Captioner] 21:34:31
AND AS WELL AS YEAH, MAKING SURE 

[Captioner] 21:34:32
THAT, YOU KNOW, WE GET THOSE 

[Captioner] 21:34:35
PROGRAMS THAT WE NEED.

[Captioner] 21:34:37
AND I DO LIKE THAT THIS PROGRAM 

[Captioner] 21:34:39
ALSO INCLUDES HAVING SOME OF 

[Captioner] 21:34:41
THAT FIRST TIME BUYER ASSISTANCE 

[Captioner] 21:34:42
PROGRAM.

[Captioner] 21:34:45
I THINK THAT THAT WOULD ALSO 

[Captioner] 21:34:48
HELP SOLVING THE BIGGER ISSUE.

[Captioner] 21:34:50
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

[Captioner] 21:34:51
>> THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 21:34:53
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 21:34:55
I'LL FOLLOW UP WITH SOME OF MY 

[Captioner] 21:34:56
COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS.

[Captioner] 21:34:57
THIS IS SOMETHING NEAR AND DEAR 

[Captioner] 21:35:00
TO ME SINCE I HAVE FOLLOWED 

[Captioner] 21:35:02
MEASURE A 1 CLOSELY AND ALSO 

[Captioner] 21:35:04
HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN A LOT OF 

[Captioner] 21:35:05
THE HOUSE ALLOCATION.

[Captioner] 21:35:08
I THINK OBVIOUSLY FROM ME WHEN 

[Captioner] 21:35:09
LOOKING AT THE DIFFERENT OPTIONS 

[Captioner] 21:35:10
THE RETURN TO SOURCE 

[Captioner] 21:35:14
ECONOMICALLY IS THE MOST LOGICAL 

[Captioner] 21:35:17
TO US BECAUSE OF THE FACT WE DO 

[Captioner] 21:35:19
GENERATE THE SECOND MOST TAX 

[Captioner] 21:35:21
REVENUE AND WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT 

[Captioner] 21:35:24
RETURN TO SOURCE BY ALLOCATIONS 

[Captioner] 21:35:25
ON THE COUNTY LEVEL IS NOTE THE 

[Captioner] 21:35:27
SAME, I DO UNDERSTAND THE NEED 

[Captioner] 21:35:29
FOR HAVING BLENDING BECAUSE OF 

[Captioner] 21:35:31
ADDRESSING LOW INCOME AND ALSO 

[Captioner] 21:35:32
THE PERCENTAGE OF THE DEMAND BUT 

[Captioner] 21:35:34
I KNOW THAT LAST TIME AROUND IN 

[Captioner] 21:35:36
MEASURE A 1 ONE OF MY COMMENTS 

[Captioner] 21:35:37
AND CHALLENGES IN LOOKING AT 

[Captioner] 21:35:39
THAT IS BECAUSE OF THE WAY IT 

[Captioner] 21:35:41
WAS FACTORED AND LOOKING AT THE 

[Captioner] 21:35:43
RETURN TO SOURCE AND FRANKLY 

[Captioner] 21:35:45
ALSO BECAUSE OF THE WAY THERE IS 

[Captioner] 21:35:47
ALSO A DIRECT PULL OUT, YOU HAVE 

[Captioner] 21:35:48
MENTIONED THAT THERE IS A 

[Captioner] 21:35:50
SEPARATE ALLOCATION SPECIFICALLY 

[Captioner] 21:35:51
FOR OAKLAND.

[Captioner] 21:35:52
HERE IN THE BAY AREA WHILE THEY 

[Captioner] 21:35:56
ARE THE SOAK LARGEST CITY FOURTH 

[Captioner] 21:35:59
LARGEST BY POPULATION WE ARE THE 

[Captioner] 21:36:01
SECOND LARGEST BY LAND MASS.

[Captioner] 21:36:02
THAT IS DIFFICULT TO ADDRESS 

[Captioner] 21:36:04
THAT IS BECAUSE SOME OF THE 

[Captioner] 21:36:05
ENCAMPMENTS AND PARKING THAT 

[Captioner] 21:36:07
WE'VE SEEN THAT IMPACT OUR 

[Captioner] 21:36:08
COMMUNITY HAS BEEN A CONCERN.

[Captioner] 21:36:10
THE OTHER THING I WANT TO NOTE 

[Captioner] 21:36:11
TOTE PUBLIC AND I THINK YOU 

[Captioner] 21:36:13
COULD CLARIFY FOR ME AND BECAUSE 

[Captioner] 21:36:15
ALSO THIS IS THOUGHT A PARCEL 

[Captioner] 21:36:18
TAX THIS IS A BOND THERE IS NO 

[Captioner] 21:36:20
EXEMPTION AND WAIVER FOR SENIORS 

[Captioner] 21:36:21
WHICH IS A CONCERN TO ME TOO 

[Captioner] 21:36:23
BECAUSE OUR CITY MUCH LIKE 

[Captioner] 21:36:27
OTHERS, IS HAVING, I'M IN THE 

[Captioner] 21:36:29
BUCKET MYSELF TOO, I'M ONE OF 

[Captioner] 21:36:30
THE PEOPLE THAT ARE LOOKING FOR 

[Captioner] 21:36:32
THAT BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THERE 

[Captioner] 21:36:34
IS AN EXOAMTION FOR SENIORS FOR 

[Captioner] 21:36:36
HOUSING.

[Captioner] 21:36:38
MANY OF THE SENIORS WHILE THEY 

[Captioner] 21:36:40
HAVE HAD TO STAY IN PLACE 

[Captioner] 21:36:42
BECAUSE OF THAT REASON, ARE ALSO 

[Captioner] 21:36:43
ON FIXED INCOME BECAUSE THAT 

[Captioner] 21:36:44
WOULD BE SOMETHING IF THERE WAS 

[Captioner] 21:36:46
A WAY TO LOOK AT THAT IT WOULD 

[Captioner] 21:36:48
BE VERY IMPORTANT OR THE US.

[Captioner] 21:36:50
I'D ALSO WANT TO NOTE THAT I 

[Captioner] 21:36:55
THINK FOR THE UPDATED PIT COUNT,

[Captioner] 21:36:55
 

[Captioner] 21:36:57
I HOPE THAT IS SOMETHING WE 

[Captioner] 21:36:58
REALLY DO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT.

[Captioner] 21:37:00
I KNOW COUNCILMEMBERS HAVE 

[Captioner] 21:37:03
REFERENCED IT AND OVER THE YEARS 

[Captioner] 21:37:05
I'VE SEEN IT GO FROM 200 PLUS, 

[Captioner] 21:37:10
255, 608, 1055.

[Captioner] 21:37:11
SHEER PERCENTAGES GROWTH WE'RE 

[Captioner] 21:37:13
SEEING BECAUSE OURS IS A LITTLE 

[Captioner] 21:37:15
BIT DIFFERENT, IT IS NOT QUITE 

[Captioner] 21:37:17
THE TENT THAT WE'RE SEEING, WE 

[Captioner] 21:37:19
HAVE SEEN A LOT OF RV AND CAR 

[Captioner] 21:37:20
PARKING PARTICULARLY BECAUSE WE 

[Captioner] 21:37:22
HAVE A LOT OF SPACES.

[Captioner] 21:37:24
I WOE HOPE THAT WOULD BE 

[Captioner] 21:37:28
SOMETHING FOCUSED ON PRAK 

[Captioner] 21:37:29
PROGRAMMATIC, COUNCILMEMBERS 

[Captioner] 21:37:31
HAVE REFERENCED THAT WE HAVE 

[Captioner] 21:37:33
SEEN AND PROUD OF THE FACT THAT 

[Captioner] 21:37:36
WE BROKE RECORD LOW INCOME 

[Captioner] 21:37:36
AFFORDABLE HOUSING.

[Captioner] 21:37:39
BUT ONE OF THE SHORT FALLS WHEN 

[Captioner] 21:37:46
WE MET RHNA NUMBERS,

[Captioner] 21:37:46
 THERE IS A 

[Captioner] 21:37:49
DI LENS CXG TRANSPORTATION OR 

[Captioner] 21:37:50
HOUSING, I THINK IT'S 

[Captioner] 21:37:54
IMPORTANTLY THAT DI IS NOT BUYS 

[Captioner] 21:37:57
OWED OFF WHERE PEOPLE LIVE BUT 

[Captioner] 21:38:01
ALSO WHERE PEOPLE WORK.

[Captioner] 21:38:05
WHILE FREMONT IS HOME OF THE 

[Captioner] 21:38:08
MOST MANUFACTURING JOMS IN THE 

[Captioner] 21:38:08
STATE OF CALIFORNIA, ONE OF THE 

[Captioner] 21:38:08
CHALLENGES IS WE HAVE SEEN SO 

[Captioner] 21:38:09
MANY RV AND CAR PARKING, PEOPLE 

[Captioner] 21:38:11
WHO WORK IN THOSE JOBS DO THOAT 

[Captioner] 21:38:13
QUALIFY FOR LOW INCOME HOUSING 

[Captioner] 21:38:16
BECAUSE THEY CAN'T AFFORD TOO 

[Captioner] 21:38:19
MUCH, BUT WE HAVE AN INCREDIBLE 

[Captioner] 21:38:21
DEMAND OR THE MARKET RATE LOW 

[Captioner] 21:38:24
INCOME HOUSING MONDAY THROUGH 

[Captioner] 21:38:25
THURSDAY GOING HOME TO WHEREVER 

[Captioner] 21:38:27
THEIR HOMES ARE ALONG THERE.

[Captioner] 21:38:31
SO THE EITHER THING IS, DO THE 

[Captioner] 21:38:32
ASTRONOMICAL GROWTH IN THAT 

[Captioner] 21:38:34
SPACE, I THOUGH THAT ONE OF MY 

[Captioner] 21:38:35
COUNCILMEMBERS JUST ASKED ABOUT 

[Captioner] 21:38:36
THE ALLOCATION.

[Captioner] 21:38:39
AND I KNOW THERE'S A DIRECT 

[Captioner] 21:38:41
ALLOCATION PER CITY BY CITY AND 

[Captioner] 21:38:42
THEN THERE IS THE SOUTH COUNTY 

[Captioner] 21:38:44
AND THEN THERE IS A POOL THAT IS 

[Captioner] 21:38:44
SET ASIDE.

[Captioner] 21:38:47
AND SO IF IT'S NOT JUST A POOL I 

[Captioner] 21:38:48
KNOW, AGAIN BECAUSE WE'RE IN THE 

[Captioner] 21:38:50
GENERAL 12 CITIES LEFT THEN 

[Captioner] 21:38:52
AFTER OAKLAND'S MONEY IS PULLED 

[Captioner] 21:38:54
OUT, THEN THAT LEAVES US AS 

[Captioner] 21:38:56
BEING ONE OF THE BIGGER SPENDERS 

[Captioner] 21:38:58
FOR THE OTHER CITIES, THE OTHER 

[Captioner] 21:38:59
11.

[Captioner] 21:39:02
BECAUSE OAKLAND HAS ALREADY BEEN 

[Captioner] 21:39:03
PULLED OUT SEPARATELY.

[Captioner] 21:39:04
I THINK THERE SHOULD BE SOME 

[Captioner] 21:39:05
CONSIDERATION.

[Captioner] 21:39:07
FREMONT BEING ONE OF THE LARGER 

[Captioner] 21:39:08
CITIES IN THE BAY AREA DOESN'T 

[Captioner] 21:39:12
HAVE A SEAT ON ABAG OR MTC AND 

[Captioner] 21:39:13
THEN WE HAVE SUPERVISORS WHO 

[Captioner] 21:39:15
REPRESENT US BUT THREE REPRESENT 

[Captioner] 21:39:17
SOME OF THE OTHER AREAS AND TWO 

[Captioner] 21:39:18
REPRESENT US HERE.

[Captioner] 21:39:20
SO WHILE WE'RE NOT GETTING MORE 

[Captioner] 21:39:21
FUNDING I KNOW THAT YOU 

[Captioner] 21:39:22
CLARIFIED EARLIER THAT THE 

[Captioner] 21:39:25
ALLOCATIONS MAKE THE CITY FOR US 

[Captioner] 21:39:28
TO ATTRIBUTE TO MORE SPECIFIC 

[Captioner] 21:39:30
FUDGED AND BETTER EQUITY BUT I 

[Captioner] 21:39:32
THINK WE SHOULD ALSO THOAT THAT 

[Captioner] 21:39:33
BECAUSE WE ARE ONLY ONE OF THE 

[Captioner] 21:39:36
BIGGEST CITIES LEFT AFTER YOU 

[Captioner] 21:39:39
PULL OUT OAKLAND, THAT OUR TAX 

[Captioner] 21:39:41
REVENUES ARE BEING SPLIT BY 11 

[Captioner] 21:39:41
CITIES.

[Captioner] 21:39:43
THAT IS NOTE THE MOST EQUITABLE 

[Captioner] 21:40:05
IN TERMS OF BEING LOOK ADD AT.

[Captioner] 21:40:05
WE HAVE A LOT OF ADUS.

[Captioner] 21:40:05
AND I APPRECIATE A LOT OF LUCIA 

[Captioner] 21:40:05
AND THE ENTIRE HOUSING TEAM WE 

[Captioner] 21:40:05
HAVE DONE AN ADU PRO BOOK TO

[Captioner] 21:40:05
 

[Captioner] 21:40:05
CREATE AWARENESS.

[Captioner] 21:40:05
WE HAVE SEEN AN INCREASE OF THE 

[Captioner] 21:40:05
ADUS BECAUSE WE MADE IT MORE 

[Captioner] 21:40:06
FACILITATED AND EASIER TO DO BUT 

[Captioner] 21:40:08
IF WE COULD HAVE THAT ALLOCATION 

[Captioner] 21:40:11
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE HAD A.

[Captioner] 21:40:12
FROM THE POINT THIS TIME COUNT 

[Captioner] 21:40:14
IF WE WERE TO GET THAT DATA 

[Captioner] 21:40:18
SOONER RATHER THAN ALERT, ACTUAL 

[Captioner] 21:40:19
MEASURABILITY IN TERMS OF WHAT 

[Captioner] 21:40:21
THE BOND WOULD ACTUALLY STATE, 

[Captioner] 21:40:24
MEASURE A 1 YOU CAME BEFORE US 

[Captioner] 21:40:28
IN I BELIEVE IT WAS IN AGO OF

[Captioner] 21:40:28
 

[Captioner] 21:40:30
THAT YEAR AND WE VOTED AS A 

[Captioner] 21:40:30
COUNCIL.

[Captioner] 21:40:33
AND I'M SUPPORTIVE OF MEASURE A 

[Captioner] 21:40:34
1 BUT AT THAT TIME I DIDN'T KNOW 

[Captioner] 21:40:36
BECAUSE WE WENT ON BREAK AND WE 

[Captioner] 21:40:37
DIDN'T HAVE THE ALLOCATION, WE 

[Captioner] 21:40:40
WERE ASKED TO SUPPORT THE BOND 

[Captioner] 21:40:40
MEASURE.

[Captioner] 21:40:42
SO I WOULD HOPE THAT WHEN YOU 

[Captioner] 21:40:44
COME BACK IF WE ARE TO PUSH THIS 

[Captioner] 21:40:45
AND HAVE A REFERRAL TO SUPPORT 

[Captioner] 21:40:47
THIS FOR A DISCUSSION OR FROM 

[Captioner] 21:40:50
THE COUNCIL, THAT I CAPTAIN 

[Captioner] 21:40:51
SUPPORT SOMETHING THAT I DON'T 

[Captioner] 21:40:52
KNOW HOW MUCH MONEY I'M GETTING 

[Captioner] 21:40:55
OUT OF BECAUSE WE'RE PAYING INTO 

[Captioner] 21:40:58
IT AND I THINK I OWE IT TO OUR 

[Captioner] 21:41:00
TAXPAYERS AND OURSELVES THAT WE 

[Captioner] 21:41:01
KNOW THE AMOUNT WE'RE GETTING 

[Captioner] 21:41:03
BACK TO COMMIT TO PAYING IN.

[Captioner] 21:41:05
THOSE WOULD BE MY GENERAL 

[Captioner] 21:41:06
COMMENTS.

[Captioner] 21:41:07
I'M CERTAINLY HAPPY AND VERY 

[Captioner] 21:41:09
SUPPORTIVE OF THIS EMPT BUT I 

[Captioner] 21:41:10
THINK IN FAIRNESS TO ALL OF OUR 

[Captioner] 21:41:14
MEMBERS MANY OF WHOM WE ALSO SEE 

[Captioner] 21:41:17
IN AARP, WE HAVE AN AGING 

[Captioner] 21:41:18
POPULATION IF WE ARE GOING TO 

[Captioner] 21:41:20
PAY IN WE WANT TO SEE THESE 

[Captioner] 21:41:21
RESULTS IN OUR COMMUNITY.

[Captioner] 21:41:22
WE WANT TO KNOW THAT THIS IS 

[Captioner] 21:41:23
SOMETHING THAT'S HAPPENING TO 

[Captioner] 21:41:24
HELP.

[Captioner] 21:41:26
I ALSO WOULD LIKE TOE REFERENCE 

[Captioner] 21:41:27
THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YOU 

[Captioner] 21:41:29
MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE CONSIDERED 

[Captioner] 21:41:32
WE HAVE ALSO SEEN SOME FAITH 

[Captioner] 21:41:33
BASED COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS 

[Captioner] 21:41:35
TAKING THEIR EXCESS LAND FOR 

[Captioner] 21:41:36
EXAMPLE IN NORTH FREMONT RIGHT 

[Captioner] 21:41:38
THERE WHERE WE HAVE ONE OF THE 

[Captioner] 21:41:40
CHURCHES THAT ARE TAKING SOME OF 

[Captioner] 21:41:45
THEIR LAND AND BUILDING 

[Captioner] 21:41:47
MULTIFAMILY THAT IS COMING FOR 

[Captioner] 21:41:48
EDEN HOUSING.

[Captioner] 21:41:50
THE QUESTION WAS FROM MY 

[Captioner] 21:41:51
COUNCILMEMBERS HOW CAN WE 

[Captioner] 21:41:54
ADDRESS THE HOMELESS, WHILE 

[Captioner] 21:41:56
SERVICES ARE NOT AVAILABLE IT IS 

[Captioner] 21:41:57
STICKS AND BRICKS.

[Captioner] 21:41:59
TOE SEE THAT WE'RE GETTING 

[Captioner] 21:42:00
ALLOCATIONS FROM THAT IN TERMS 

[Captioner] 21:42:02
OF CONSIDERATION BECAUSE OUR 

[Captioner] 21:42:05
HOMELESS POINT IN TIME COUNT IS 

[Captioner] 21:42:07
REALLY IS, IF YOU LOOK AT ALL 

[Captioner] 21:42:09
THE OTHER SURROUNDING CITIES IT 

[Captioner] 21:42:11
IS THE MOST IMPACTED AND IT IS 

[Captioner] 21:42:12
SOMETHING WE WANT TO PUT MONEY 

[Captioner] 21:42:14
INTO TO SEE RESULTS COME OUT 

[Captioner] 21:42:15
OF.

[Captioner] 21:42:16
SO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT.

[Captioner] 21:42:17
>> THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 21:42:18
>> Mayor Mei:   IS THERE ANY 

[Captioner] 21:42:20
OTHER COMMENTS?

[Captioner] 21:42:21
COUNCILMEMBER KENG YOU HAVE A 

[Captioner] 21:42:22
BUTTON -- IS THAT FROM BEFORE, 

[Captioner] 21:42:23
THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 21:42:24
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE FROM THE 

[Captioner] 21:42:26
COUNCIL, IS THERE ANY INTEREST 

[Captioner] 21:42:27
TO HAVE A FOLLOW UP PRESENTATION 

[Captioner] 21:42:29
AND IN FAIRNESS WOULDN'T THIS BE 

[Captioner] 21:42:31
A GOOD TIME BECAUSE I'D LIKE TO 

[Captioner] 21:42:33
HAVE SOME OF THOSE ANSWERS FOR 

[Captioner] 21:42:35
US TO BE ABLE TO MAKE A DECISION 

[Captioner] 21:42:36
WHETHER OR NOT WE'RE GOING TOE 

[Captioner] 21:42:36
SUPPORT.

[Captioner] 21:42:37
BECAUSE AGAIN AS I REFERRED TO 

[Captioner] 21:42:39
EARLIER I CAN'T SEIZE MYSELF 

[Captioner] 21:42:41
BEING ABLE TO SUPPORT SOMETHING 

[Captioner] 21:42:44
IF I DON'T HAVE CLARITY IN TERMS 

[Captioner] 21:42:45
OF THE FUNDING ALLOCATIONS.

[Captioner] 21:42:47
>> WE HOPE TO BE MAKING 

[Captioner] 21:42:48
PRESENTATIONS TO THE BOARD OF 

[Captioner] 21:42:50
SUPERVISORS IN MAY AND GETTING 

[Captioner] 21:42:53
FEEDBACK, HOPEFULLY FROM THE 

[Captioner] 21:42:55
COMMUNITY, PROBABLY IN JUNE AND 

[Captioner] 21:42:56
JULY.

[Captioner] 21:42:58
SO I WOULD SAY LATE SUMMER WOULD 

[Captioner] 21:42:58
BE GOOD.

[Captioner] 21:43:00
BECAUSE WE WOULD HAVE HAD THE 

[Captioner] 21:43:01
PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD.

[Captioner] 21:43:04
AND WE DEFINITELY ENCOURAGE AND 

[Captioner] 21:43:07
WILL MAKE SURE LUCIA IS PART OF 

[Captioner] 21:43:09
THE OUTREACH AND ENGAGEMENT PART 

[Captioner] 21:43:12
BUT WE WOULD ENCOURAGE FORMAL 

[Captioner] 21:43:14
COMMENTS FROM THE CITY COUNCIL.

[Captioner] 21:43:15
BECAUSE WE DEFINITELY WANT TO 

[Captioner] 21:43:16
HEAR FROM YOU.

[Captioner] 21:43:17
>> Mayor Mei:   DO YOU THINK BY 

[Captioner] 21:43:19
THAT POINT, I KNOW LAST TIME WE 

[Captioner] 21:43:21
HAD A PRELIMINARY PIT COUNT BUT 

[Captioner] 21:43:23
WE DIDN'T HAVE A BREAKDOWN.

[Captioner] 21:43:25
ONE OF THE QUESTIONS WAS WE HAVE 

[Captioner] 21:43:27
A HIGH NUMBER AND THEN YOU GO 

[Captioner] 21:43:29
DOWN INTO ANOTHER TOLL UP STUDY 

[Captioner] 21:43:31
AND INVOLVED IN THAT IN THE PAST 

[Captioner] 21:43:34
AND WE SEE HOW MUCH THE MARKET 

[Captioner] 21:43:35
RATE VERSUS IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH 

[Captioner] 21:43:37
IS LOW VERY LOW IN TERMS OF AND 

[Captioner] 21:43:39
THE REASONS WHY PEOPLE ARE 

[Captioner] 21:43:41
HOMELESS, IT MAKES US HAVE A 

[Captioner] 21:43:44
BETTER NIGHT IN TERMS OF HOW WE 

[Captioner] 21:43:47
HAVE ALLOCATIONS.

[Captioner] 21:43:48
DO YOU BELIEVE YOU'LL BE ABLE TO 

[Captioner] 21:43:50
HAVE THAT IN SUMMER?

[Captioner] 21:43:51
>> I BELIEVE WE VP.

[Captioner] 21:43:53
THE POINT IN TIME COUNT IS NO 

[Captioner] 21:43:55
LONGER IN MY OFFICE.

[Captioner] 21:43:58
WE DID IT IN 2022, WE STARTED 

[Captioner] 21:44:00
THE OFFICE OF HOMELESS CARE AND 

[Captioner] 21:44:02
CONSIDERATION, I MOVED ALL OF MY 

[Captioner] 21:44:06
STAFF TO THAT DEPARTMENT, THEY

[Captioner] 21:44:06
 

[Captioner] 21:44:08
DON'T WORK INFORM ME ANYMORE.

[Captioner] 21:44:10
I HAVE TO GET CLARITY WHEN IT'S 

[Captioner] 21:44:11
COMING IDENTITY.

[Captioner] 21:44:12
>> Mayor Mei:   I THINK FROM THE 

[Captioner] 21:44:14
COUNCIL WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A 

[Captioner] 21:44:17
BETTER MORE COMPLETE PICTURE, 

[Captioner] 21:44:20
I'VE HEARD FROM ALL THE 

[Captioner] 21:44:21
COUNCILMEMBERS, BEFORE WE COULD 

[Captioner] 21:44:22
SUPPORT OR THOUGHT SUPPORT THIS 

[Captioner] 21:44:24
MEASURE.

[Captioner] 21:44:25
COUNCILMEMBER COX, CLARIFYING 

[Captioner] 21:44:26
QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS.

[Captioner] 21:44:27
>> Councilmember Cox:   I JUST 

[Captioner] 21:44:29
WANTED TO ASK ONE OTHER THING AS 

[Captioner] 21:44:31
YOU ARE PURING TOGETHER THE 

[Captioner] 21:44:33
PRESENTATION WITH UL ATHE 

[Captioner] 21:44:33
UPDATES.

[Captioner] 21:44:36
WOULD WE BE ABLE TO USE THE 

[Captioner] 21:44:37
MONEY FOR ACQUIRING PROPERTY 

[Captioner] 21:44:40
THAT WOULD BE FOR SAFE PARKING 

[Captioner] 21:44:41
OR DESIGNATED AREAS?

[Captioner] 21:44:44
BECAUSE I HEAR YOU SAY NO FOR 

[Captioner] 21:44:44
SERVICES.

[Captioner] 21:44:49
BUT SOME SORT OF LAND USE OR

[Captioner] 21:44:49
 

[Captioner] 21:44:50
SOMETHING ESPECIALLY DESIGNATED 

[Captioner] 21:44:53
BY THE CITY WITH ORDINANCES.

[Captioner] 21:44:57
>> YES, SO THE GENERAL 

[Captioner] 21:44:58
OBLIGATION BOND RULES IS THAT 

[Captioner] 21:45:00
YOU MUST INVEST IN REAL 

[Captioner] 21:45:02
PROPERTY, EITHER THE 

[Captioner] 21:45:03
CONSTRUCTION AND OR REQUISITION 

[Captioner] 21:45:04
OF REAL PROPERTY.

[Captioner] 21:45:06
IF THE -- ACQUISITION OF REAL 

[Captioner] 21:45:07
PROPERTY.

[Captioner] 21:45:09
IF THE CITY WERE TO PURCHASE 

[Captioner] 21:45:10
REAL ESTATE IN ORDER TO 

[Captioner] 21:45:13
ESTABLISH A SAFE PARKING 

[Captioner] 21:45:15
PROGRAM, THE ACQUISITION OF THE 

[Captioner] 21:45:18
REAL ESTATE SHOULD BE POSSIBLE, 

[Captioner] 21:45:21
I'LL HAVE TO CHECK IN WITH BOND 

[Captioner] 21:45:23
COUNSEL ABOUT BUT I BELIEVE IT 

[Captioner] 21:45:24
SHOULD BE.

[Captioner] 21:45:25
PAVING, ET CETERA, THAT SHOULD 

[Captioner] 21:45:27
ALSO BE AND WHAT WE WOULD NEED 

[Captioner] 21:45:29
TO DO IS ENSURE THAT THE FUNDS 

[Captioner] 21:45:30
THAT ARE ALLOCATED DOWN TO EACH 

[Captioner] 21:45:32
OF THE CITIES HAVE SOME 

[Captioner] 21:45:32
FLEXIBILITY.

[Captioner] 21:45:34
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT PRODUCTION, 

[Captioner] 21:45:37
AND THE CREATION OF SAFE SPACES 

[Captioner] 21:45:38
FOR PEOPLE.

[Captioner] 21:45:41
AND SO WHILE WE THINK OF IT AS 

[Captioner] 21:45:43
TAX CREDIT HOITION, IT DOESN'T 

[Captioner] 21:45:45
HAVE TO BE TAX CREDIT HOUSING.

[Captioner] 21:45:48
IT COULD BE TINY HOMES, IT COULD 

[Captioner] 21:45:50
BE THE ACQUISITION OF LAND THAT 

[Captioner] 21:45:53
YOU ARE LAND BANKING AND THE 

[Captioner] 21:45:54
IMMEDIATE MOMENT YOU ARE USING 

[Captioner] 21:45:56
AS A SAFE PARKING PROGRAM BUT 

[Captioner] 21:45:58
MAYBE IN TEN YEARS YOU'RE 

[Captioner] 21:46:00
PUTTING AFFORDABLE HOUSING ON 

[Captioner] 21:46:00
IT.

[Captioner] 21:46:01
THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES THERE 

[Captioner] 21:46:03
AND WE SHOULD EXPLORE THE 

[Captioner] 21:46:04
POLICIES TO BE SURE, EXPLORE THE 

[Captioner] 21:46:06
OPTIONS WITH THE POLICIES TO 

[Captioner] 21:46:07
MAKE SURE THEY ARE FLEXIBLE 

[Captioner] 21:46:10
ENOUGH TO MEET YOUR NEEDS.

[Captioner] 21:46:11
>> Councilmember Cox:   THAT 

[Captioner] 21:46:13
WOULD BE GREAT TO WORK OUT THE 

[Captioner] 21:46:15
DETAILS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN 

[Captioner] 21:46:16
SPOKEN TOTO INCLUDE THAT 

[Captioner] 21:46:17
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IN YOUR 

[Captioner] 21:46:19
PRESENTATION SO WE KNOW FULL

THEY DID WITH GOODNESS VILLAGE 

[Captioner] 21:46:46

[Captioner] 21:46:47
IT DID TAKE PEOPLE OUT OF BEING 

[Captioner] 21:46:51
IN THEIR CARS AND RVS INTO A 

[Captioner] 21:46:53
LOAN ACQUISITION AND THAT WAS 

[Captioner] 21:46:55

THE SAFETY OF CHILDREN BY 

[Captioner] 21:52:08
ENSURING ADEQUATE SUPPLIES OF

[Captioner] 21:52:14
SHARED PERSONAL STORIES OF 

[Captioner] 21:52:17

[Captioner] 21:52:48
DISTURBING INCREASE IN 

[Captioner] 21:52:53
ISLAMOPHOBIA AND ANTISEMITISM, 

[Captioner] 21:52:57
ANTIARABIC, ANTIJEWISH HATE 

[Captioner] 21:52:59
WHICH LEAVES MANY FEELING

HATE.

[Captioner] 21:53:37
WE URGE ALL PARTIES INVOLVED TO

AND THIS -- AND AS I MENTIONED 

[Captioner] 21:54:19
EARLIER ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I 

[Captioner] 21:54:20
WAS HOPING TO DO WAS TO MOVE 

[Captioner] 21:54:23
THIS STATEMENT FORWARD TONIGHT, 

[Captioner] 21:54:25
WITH THE SUPPORT OF OUR CITY 

[Captioner] 21:54:26
COUNCIL.

[Captioner] 21:54:27
THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR 

[Captioner] 21:54:27
LISTENING.

[Captioner] 21:54:29
I WILL TURN THIS BACK TO THE 

[Captioner] 21:54:30
MAYOR.

[Captioner] 21:54:31
>> Mayor Mei:   THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 21:54:33
AND AT THIS TIME I'LL ASK FOR 

[Captioner] 21:54:36
QUESTIONS FROM THE COUNCIL ON 

[Captioner] 21:54:36
THIS.

[Captioner] 21:54:41
ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS?

[Captioner] 21:54:44
CAN I JUST CHECK FOR 

[Captioner] 21:54:45
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN BECAUSE 

[Captioner] 21:54:49
SHE'S THE ONLY ONE FOR HER 

[Captioner] 21:54:49
VOTE?

[Captioner] 21:54:50
>> Councilmember Kassan:   I DO, 

[Captioner] 21:54:52
AND, YOU KNOW, I STRUGGLE IN 

[Captioner] 21:54:54
WHETHER I SHOULD ASK THIS OR 

[Captioner] 21:54:56
NOT.

[Captioner] 21:54:57
AND COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL IF 

[Captioner] 21:54:59
YOU DON'T WANT TO ANSWER IT, 

[Captioner] 21:54:59
IT'S FINE.

[Captioner] 21:55:02
BUT I'M JUST -- YOU KNOW THERE 

[Captioner] 21:55:03
WAS SUCH A HIGH LEVEL OF REQUEST 

[Captioner] 21:55:08
TOE USE THE WORD

[Captioner] 21:55:09
 CEASE FIRE IN 

[Captioner] 21:55:12
THIS RESOLUTION AND I'M JUST 

[Captioner] 21:55:13
WONDERING WHY YOU CHOSE NOT TO 

[Captioner] 21:55:15
USE IT.

[Captioner] 21:55:16
>> Mayor Mei:   GO AHEAD 

[Captioner] 21:55:17
COUNCILMEMBER.

[Captioner] 21:55:19
RESPOND ON THAT AND I'LL HAVE 

[Captioner] 21:55:20
QUESTIONS TOO.

[Captioner] 21:55:20
>> Councilmember Campbell:   SO 

[Captioner] 21:55:22
I HAVE RECEIVED A THOUSAND PLUS 

[Captioner] 21:55:23
E-MAILS.

[Captioner] 21:55:24
AND A LOT OF THEM DID HAVE A 

[Captioner] 21:55:26
REQUEST INFORM A CEASE FIRE.

[Captioner] 21:55:30
AND ONE OF THE THINGS -- FOR A 

[Captioner] 21:55:31
CEASE FIRE.

[Captioner] 21:55:34
ONE OF THE THINGS I WAS TORN BY, 

[Captioner] 21:55:35
TWO THINGS ACTUALLY.

[Captioner] 21:55:37
THE FIRST ONE WAS THAT THE 

[Captioner] 21:55:39
COUNCIL HAS HAD A LONG STANDING 

[Captioner] 21:55:41
PRACTICE TO NOT BE INVOLVED IN 

[Captioner] 21:55:43
INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS.

[Captioner] 21:55:46
AND BECAUSE THAT PRACTICE HAS 

[Captioner] 21:55:49
BEEN SOMETHING THAT WE WERE 

[Captioner] 21:55:52
HOPING TO CONTINUE, IT WOULD 

[Captioner] 21:55:54
SEEM A BIT HYPOCRITICAL FOR ME 

[Captioner] 21:55:56
TO TAKE SIDES.

[Captioner] 21:55:59
AND SO IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT 

[Captioner] 21:56:02
IT DIDN'T SEEM HYPOCRITICAL THAT 

[Captioner] 21:56:05
WE, ON ONE HAND WE SAY WE DON'T 

[Captioner] 21:56:07
AND ANOTHER ONE WE ARE SAYING 

[Captioner] 21:56:09
OKAY LET'S CALL FOR A CEASE 

[Captioner] 21:56:09
FIRE.

[Captioner] 21:56:11
I JUST DIDN'T -- THAT WAS ONE 

[Captioner] 21:56:11
WAY.

[Captioner] 21:56:13
AND THEN THE OTHER ONE WAS I 

[Captioner] 21:56:15
THOUGHT IT WAS VERY DIVISIVE.

[Captioner] 21:56:17
I THOUGHT WE WERE TAKING SIDES 

[Captioner] 21:56:18
AND WE CAN'T SAY THAT WE ARE 

[Captioner] 21:56:21
TRYING TO BE MUTUAL, WE'RE 

[Captioner] 21:56:23
TRYING TO BRING HARMONY, TRYING 

[Captioner] 21:56:26
TO BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER IF WE 

[Captioner] 21:56:27
ARE CREATING AN ENVIRONMENT THAT 

[Captioner] 21:56:28
IS DIVISIVE.

[Captioner] 21:56:29
SO PUTTING THAT STATEMENT THERE 

[Captioner] 21:56:31
IT MADE ME FEEL THOSE TWO 

[Captioner] 21:56:32
THINGS.

[Captioner] 21:56:34
THAT I WAS HYPOCRITICAL ABOUT 

[Captioner] 21:56:36
INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS AND I WAS 

[Captioner] 21:56:38
BEING DIVISIVE AFTER I SAID I 

[Captioner] 21:56:40
WANTED TO BRING US TOGETHER IN 

[Captioner] 21:56:42
UNITY AND HARMONY.

[Captioner] 21:56:43
SO THAT IS WHY COUNCILMEMBER 

[Captioner] 21:56:46
KASSAN, I WOULD NOT BE OPEN TO 

[Captioner] 21:56:48
PUTTING THE WORD CEASE FIRE IN 

[Captioner] 21:56:50
THIS PARTICULAR STATEMENT IN 

[Captioner] 21:56:53
SUPPORT OF WHAT'S GOING ON IN 

[Captioner] 21:56:54
GAZA AND ISRAEL.

[Captioner] 21:56:54
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

[Captioner] 21:56:58
>> Mayor Mei:   SO THANK YOU FOR 

[Captioner] 21:56:59
THAT CLARIFYING.

[Captioner] 21:57:01
I ALSO WILL ASK A CLARIFYING 

[Captioner] 21:57:01
QUESTION.

[Captioner] 21:57:03
ONE OF THE THINGS I THINK YOU 

[Captioner] 21:57:07
AND I HAVE HAD SOME

[Captioner] 21:57:21
 CORE SPON DENSE 

[Captioner] 21:57:24
ON THIS, THIS IS NOT THE FIRST 

[Captioner] 21:57:26
ISSUE THAT HAS BEEN BROUGHT TO 

[Captioner] 21:57:26
US.

[Captioner] 21:57:29
I KNOW IN FOLLOWING MY 

[Captioner] 21:57:30
 

[Captioner] 21:57:33
PREDECESSORS, MAYOR WASSERMAN 

[Captioner] 21:57:35
AND HARRISON, AMONG OTHERS, IS 

[Captioner] 21:57:37
THAT OUR COUNCIL'S PAST PRACTICE 

[Captioner] 21:57:39
AS WE MENTIONED IS NOT TAKING A 

[Captioner] 21:57:41
POSITION ON MATTERS CONCERNING 

[Captioner] 21:57:42
FOREIGN POLICY IN THE UNITED 

[Captioner] 21:57:43
STATES NOR ITS RELATIONSHIP TO 

[Captioner] 21:57:44
OTHER COUNTRIES.

[Captioner] 21:57:45
SO WHILE WHEE DON'T HAVE 

[Captioner] 21:57:47
OFFICIAL DOCUMENT I'D ASK 

[Captioner] 21:57:48
WHETHER OR NOT WE CONSIDER THAT 

[Captioner] 21:57:50
FOR SOMETHING AND PERHAPS THAT 

[Captioner] 21:57:51
IS SOMETHING WE WOULD CONSIDER 

[Captioner] 21:57:53
AT THE RETREAT.

[Captioner] 21:57:55
BECAUSE I THINK IT IS 

[Captioner] 21:57:55
IMPORTANT.

[Captioner] 21:57:56
WE HAVE BEEN ASKED IN THE PAST I 

[Captioner] 21:57:58
KNOW YOU MAY NOT HAVE BEEN ON 

[Captioner] 21:57:59
THE COUNCIL AT THAT TIME, FOR 

[Captioner] 21:58:01
WHEN THERE WAS A DECISION TO 

[Captioner] 21:58:04
WITHDRAW FROM AFGHANISTAN, AND 

[Captioner] 21:58:06
MY FEELING IS THAT STAYS WITH US 

[Captioner] 21:58:08
IN THIS ROLE, IS THAT MY FIRST 

[Captioner] 21:58:11
AND FOREMOST JOB AND IT SAYS SOW 

[Captioner] 21:58:12
ON OUR COUNCIL WEBSITE, THAT 

[Captioner] 21:58:16
TALKS ABOUT WE ARE RESPONSIBLE 

[Captioner] 21:58:18
FOR A CITY'S PRACTICES AND 

[Captioner] 21:58:18
IMPACTS.

[Captioner] 21:58:22
SO IN THAT CASE WITH THE AFGHAN 

[Captioner] 21:58:24
DECISION AT THAT TIME, IN 

[Captioner] 21:58:25
DEFERENCE AND RESPECT FOR THE 

[Captioner] 21:58:27
NEEDS OF OUR COMMUNITY AND THE 

[Captioner] 21:58:29
MEMBERS BY WHICH WE SERVE AND 

[Captioner] 21:58:30
THE QUESTIONS ABOUT TAX DOLLARS 

[Captioner] 21:58:35
AND THAT STUFF WE SET UP A

[Captioner] 21:58:35
 

[Captioner] 21:58:40
SEPARATE AFGHAN RELIEF FUND, 

[Captioner] 21:58:41
PEOPLE LIVING IN OUR CITY.

[Captioner] 21:58:43
BUT IN TERMS OF AN INTERNET OF 

[Captioner] 21:58:46
THINGS LIKE THIS WE HAVE UKRAINE 

[Captioner] 21:58:51
AND RUSSIA WE HAVE SUDAN

[Captioner] 21:58:54
, HAITI, 

[Captioner] 21:58:55
INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS, I DID 

[Captioner] 21:58:58
BRING UP TO THE PUBLIC THAT WE 

[Captioner] 21:58:59
HAD THIS CONVERSATION.

[Captioner] 21:59:01
THEREFORE I'M SUPPORTIVE OF THE 

[Captioner] 21:59:02
IDEA IF THIS IS SOMETHING THAT 

[Captioner] 21:59:04
WE UNDERSTAND THAT WE'RE MAKING 

[Captioner] 21:59:06
A STATEMENT THAT IS UNIFYING 

[Captioner] 21:59:08
THAT IS NOTE DIVISIVE THAT 

[Captioner] 21:59:09
BRINGS PEOPLE TOGETHER.

[Captioner] 21:59:10
SO FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE I 

[Captioner] 21:59:11
APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION THAT 

[Captioner] 21:59:13
WE HAD AND I JUST WANTED TO MAKE 

[Captioner] 21:59:15
SURE THAT THE PUBLIC IS AWARE 

[Captioner] 21:59:17
THAT I DID HAVE SOME 

[Captioner] 21:59:18
CONVERSATIONS WITH YOU AND I 

[Captioner] 21:59:19
APPRECIATE YOUR THOUGHTS 

[Captioner] 21:59:21
REGARDING THIS DISCUSSION.

[Captioner] 21:59:21
>> Councilmember Campbell:   

[Captioner] 21:59:24
YES, I WOULD BE OPEN TO HAVING A 

[Captioner] 21:59:25
DISCUSSION AT THE RETREAT.

[Captioner] 21:59:27
>> Mayor Mei:   YES, THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 21:59:28
AT THIS TIME ARE THERE ANY OTHER 

[Captioner] 21:59:29
CLARIFYING QUESTIONS?

[Captioner] 21:59:31
IF NOT I'M GOING TO TURN IT OVER 

[Captioner] 21:59:33
TOE OUR PUBLIC SPEAKERS.

[Captioner] 21:59:35
DID YOU PUSH THE BUTTON?

[Captioner] 21:59:36
SORRY.

[Captioner] 21:59:39
I CAN'T SEE -- OKAY THANK YOU 

[Captioner] 21:59:42
COUNCILMEMBER COX.

[Captioner] 21:59:42
>> Councilmember Cox:   THANK 

[Captioner] 21:59:46
YOU VERY MUCH, COUNCILWOMAN 

[Captioner] 21:59:48
CAMPBELL FOR THIS STATEMENT.

[Captioner] 21:59:49
I DID HAVE A COUPLE OF 

[Captioner] 21:59:51
CLARIFYING QUESTIONS.

[Captioner] 21:59:55
WHEN YOU COME TO THE FOURTH 

[Captioner] 21:59:57
PROGRAM, WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT 

[Captioner] 22:00:02
ANTISEMITISM, AND ANTIJEWISH, I

[Captioner] 22:00:02
 

[Captioner] 22:00:04
WAS WONDERING IF THERE WAS SOME 

[Captioner] 22:00:07
REASON YOU DIDN'T USE 

[Captioner] 22:00:10
ANTIPALESTINE OR ANTIISRAELI IN 

[Captioner] 22:00:10
YOUR STATEMENT THERE.

[Captioner] 22:00:18
AND REMOVE LIKE EITHER 

[Captioner] 22:00:20
ANTISEMITISM OR ANTIJEWISH ONE 

[Captioner] 22:00:21
OR THE EARTH O.

[Captioner] 22:00:23
WAS THERE ANY THOUGHT ABOUT 

[Captioner] 22:00:23
THAT?

[Captioner] 22:00:24
>> Councilmember Campbell:   YOU 

[Captioner] 22:00:26
KNOW, I THINK THAT THIS IS WHAT 

[Captioner] 22:00:27
WE WERE HEARING FROM THE 

[Captioner] 22:00:27
PUBLIC.

[Captioner] 22:00:29
THAT THESE WERE PUBLIC 

[Captioner] 22:00:31
STATEMENTS FROM LOTS OF THE 

[Captioner] 22:00:32
PUBLIC COMMENTS THAT I WAS 

[Captioner] 22:00:33
GOATING.

[Captioner] 22:00:34
THAT THIS WAS THE LANGUAGE THAT 

[Captioner] 22:00:37
I WAS CONSTANTLY HEARING.

[Captioner] 22:00:40
AND I WANTED TO REAFFIRM THAT WE 

[Captioner] 22:00:41
WERE HEARING THE LANGUAGE THAT 

[Captioner] 22:00:43
WAS COMING FROM THE PUBLIC.

[Captioner] 22:00:45
SO THAT'S WHY -- I HAD NOT HEARD 

[Captioner] 22:00:49
THOSE STATEMENTS IN ANY OF THE 

[Captioner] 22:00:51
CORRESPONDENCES THAT WE HAVE 

[Captioner] 22:00:54
RECEIVED.

[Captioner] 22:00:55
>> Councilmember Cox:   OKAY AND 

[Captioner] 22:00:56
IS THERE PARTICULAR GROUPS THAT 

[Captioner] 22:00:58
YOU HAD CONSULTED WITH THAT YOU 

[Captioner] 22:01:00
COULD SHARE WITH US WHO IS 

[Captioner] 22:01:04
SUPPORTING THIS STATEMENT?

[Captioner] 22:01:10
>> Mayor Mei:   I'LL TAKE A STAB 

[Captioner] 22:01:10
AT THIS.

[Captioner] 22:01:13
I THINK LOOKING AT THIS, THIS 

[Captioner] 22:01:14
LOOKS LIKE IT'S TAKEN THERE SOME 

[Captioner] 22:01:18
OF THE OTHER VERBIAGE FROM OTHER 

[Captioner] 22:01:19
CITIES FROM LOOKING AT THIS, IT 

[Captioner] 22:01:21
LOOKS LIKE IT WAS BASED OFF OF 

[Captioner] 22:01:25
SOME OF THE OTHER IMPACTED

[Captioner] 22:01:26
 -- 

[Captioner] 22:01:28
MOSTLY AUDIENCE MEMBERS I'VE 

[Captioner] 22:01:30
BEEN REFERENCING MANY SOME OF 

[Captioner] 22:01:31
THE PREVIOUS AMENDMENTS THAT 

[Captioner] 22:01:33
HAVE BEEN PASSED, DISCUSSIONS.

[Captioner] 22:01:35
AND I KNOW THIS IS A STATEMENT 

[Captioner] 22:01:38
NOT SO MUCH AS A RFLTION OR A 

[Captioner] 22:01:38
PROCLAMATION.

[Captioner] 22:01:40
SO I THINK THAT WAS MIRRORING 

[Captioner] 22:01:42
SOME OF THAT THAT WE HAD SEEN IN 

[Captioner] 22:01:43
OTHER CITIES.

[Captioner] 22:01:43
>> Councilmember Campbell:   

[Captioner] 22:01:45
RIGHT, IN PARTICULAR THIS WAS 

[Captioner] 22:01:47
SOMETHING THAT THE CITY, THANK 

[Captioner] 22:01:49
YOU MAYOR MEI, LOTS OF THE 

[Captioner] 22:01:50
COMMUNITY MEMBERS THAT CAME OUT 

[Captioner] 22:01:53
TO GIVE A PUBLIC STATEMENT DID 

[Captioner] 22:01:54
MENTION QUITE A FEW.

[Captioner] 22:01:55
SO I DID SOME RESEARCH.

[Captioner] 22:01:58
I LOOKED UP RICHMOND, I LOOKED 

[Captioner] 22:02:00
UP ALBANY, I LOOKED AT SAN JOSE, 

[Captioner] 22:02:03
I LOOKED AT SAN FRANCISCO, I 

[Captioner] 22:02:05
LOOKED AT BERKELEY, I LOOKED AT 

[Captioner] 22:02:06
ALL OF THE OTHER EXAMPLES OF 

[Captioner] 22:02:07
WHAT WAS HAPPENING.

[Captioner] 22:02:11
I ALSO TOOK INTO CONSIDERATION

[Captioner] 22:02:11
 

[Captioner] 22:02:16
THE -- THE RESPONSE TO SOME OF

[Captioner] 22:02:17
 

[Captioner] 22:02:20
THOSE OTHER CITIES.

[Captioner] 22:02:25
AND WE DECIDED, WITH STAFF 

[Captioner] 22:02:27
SUPPORT AND WITH LEGAL COUNSEL, 

[Captioner] 22:02:29
THAT HAVING A STATEMENT SIMILAR 

[Captioner] 22:02:32
TO WHAT SAN JOSE DID, WAS THE 

[Captioner] 22:02:35
BEST OPTION FOR FREMONT.

[Captioner] 22:02:36
>> Councilmember Cox:   OKAY.

[Captioner] 22:02:38
DID OUR FREMONT HUMAN RELATIONS 

[Captioner] 22:02:40
COMMISSION EVER SUBMIT COMMENTS 

[Captioner] 22:02:41
REGARDING THIS?

[Captioner] 22:02:41
>> Councilmember Campbell:   

[Captioner] 22:02:43
THEY HAVE NOT, THAT I'M AWARE 

[Captioner] 22:02:43
OF.

[Captioner] 22:02:46
>> Councilmember Cox:   OKAY.

[Captioner] 22:02:50
THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 22:02:51
>> Mayor Mei:   I'M SURE THERE 

[Captioner] 22:02:53
WILL BE PLENTY OF FEEDBACK THIS 

[Captioner] 22:02:53
EVENING.

[Captioner] 22:02:55
SO WITH THAT, IF THERE'S NO 

[Captioner] 22:02:56
OTHER COMMENTS AT THIS TIME, I'M 

[Captioner] 22:02:58
GOING TOE OPEN FOR THE PUBLIC 

[Captioner] 22:02:59

[Captioner] 22:03:15
ABLE TO RUN THROUGH THIS.

[Captioner] 22:03:17

[Captioner] 22:03:20

[Captioner] 22:03:23

[Captioner] 22:31:50
EACH TIME AFTER EVERY ATTACK

[Captioner] 22:31:50
 

[Captioner] 22:31:52
HAMAS CAME WITH A REQUEST FOR 

[Captioner] 22:31:53
CEASE FIRE.

[Captioner] 22:31:55
THAT'S REALLY THE TACTICS.

[Captioner] 22:31:56
THEY ALWAYS REQUEST FOR CEASE 

[Captioner] 22:31:59
FIRE AND THIS CEASE FIRE NEVER 

[Captioner] 22:32:00

[Captioner] 22:32:03
SO FOR THE SAKE OF THE CHILDREN 

[Captioner] 22:32:05
OF GAZA AND ISRAEL WE NEED 

[Captioner] 22:32:06

[Captioner] 22:32:10

THE OUTSIDE CHANCE, ALL OVER THE 

[Captioner] 22:34:17

[Captioner] 22:34:18
I'M A JEW.

[Captioner] 22:34:19
IT HAPPENED BEFORE.

[Captioner] 22:34:22
HOLOCAUST WAS ONE OF MORE RECENT 

[Captioner] 22:34:23
EXAMPLES OF IT.

OF FREMONT, THIS STATEMENT ISN'T 

[Captioner] 22:34:53
GOING TO DRIVE PEACE.

[Captioner] 22:34:55
WE ARE A LOCAL CITY.

[Captioner] 22:34:57
WE SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON THE CITY 

[Captioner] 22:34:59
THAT ARE WITHIN OUR 

[Captioner] 22:34:59
JURISDICTION.

[Captioner] 22:35:32
CITY DOES NOT MAKE INTERNATIONAL 

[Captioner] 22:35:34

[Captioner] 22:35:36
IT'S SIMPLY OUTSIDE THE SCOPE OF 

[Captioner] 22:35:38
ANYTHING WE CAN DO AND CLEARLY 

[Captioner] 22:35:41
CAUSES US NOTHING BUT DIVISION.

ON HOW TO RESOLVE THE CONFLICT 

[Captioner] 22:37:29
WHICH I DON'T BELIEVE ANY OF US 

[Captioner] 22:37:30

[Captioner] 22:37:32
HAMAS PROBABLY NEEDS TO BE 

[Captioner] 22:37:33
REMOVED FROM GAZA BEFORE THERE 

[Captioner] 22:37:35
CAN BE A LASTING PEACE AND HOW 

[Captioner] 22:37:38
WOULD THAT OCCUR IF THERE'S A 

[Captioner] 22:37:40
CEASE FIRE?

FREMONT OR THE 52 YEARS.

[Captioner] 22:52:28
BETWEEN 1972 AND 1980 I WAS THE 

[Captioner] 22:52:29
ASSISTANT CITY ATTORNEY OF 

[Captioner] 22:52:30
TREATMENT.

[Captioner] 22:52:32
DURING THAT TIME, THE CITY OF 

[Captioner] 22:52:35
FREMONT CONSIDERED MANY MAJOR 

[Captioner] 22:52:37
RESIDENTIAL PROJECTS.

[Captioner] 22:52:39
THE CITY COUNCIL HAD COMPLETE 

[Captioner] 22:52:41
JURISDICTION AND CONTROL OVER 

[Captioner] 22:52:43
THOSE PROJECTS.

[Captioner] 22:52:45
WHAT'S BEEN PROPOSED UNDER 

[Captioner] 22:52:48
AGENDA ITEM 7A HOWEVER, NO 

[Captioner] 22:52:50
MATTER HOW YOU SLICE IT IS A

HAMAS.

[Captioner] 22:53:34
THE BLOT OF CIVILIANS IS ON

[Captioner] 23:02:53
THANK YOU.

>> NAMASTE, EVERYONE.

[Captioner] 23:03:06
FREMONT IS CONSISTENTLY THE 

[Captioner] 23:03:07
HAPPIEST CITY IN U.S.

[Captioner] 23:03:10
AND ALSO FREMONT HAS THE LARGEST 

[Captioner] 23:03:11
HINDU POPULATION IN CALIFORNIA.

[Captioner] 23:03:14
WE HINDUS BELIEVE IN KARMA, 

[Captioner] 23:03:15
WHICH MEANS PATH TO RIGHTNESS.

[Captioner] 23:03:18
SO I REQUEST MAYOR AND THE 

[Captioner] 23:03:20
COUNCILMEMBERS TO ASK YOURSELF 

[Captioner] 23:03:21
THREE QUESTIONS BEFORE YOU 

[Captioner] 23:03:23
DECIDE ON TODAY'S -- THE 

[Captioner] 23:03:24
STATEMENT OR RESOLUTION.

[Captioner] 23:03:25
THE FIRST QUESTION IS, WHO 

[Captioner] 23:03:26
STARTED THIS WAR?

[Captioner] 23:03:31
AND WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE 

[Captioner] 23:03:33
BARBARIC ACT ON INNOCENT 

[Captioner] 23:03:34
CIVILIANS ON OCTOBER 7TH?

[Captioner] 23:03:36
THE SECOND QUESTION IS, WHO CAN 

[Captioner] 23:03:36
STOP THIS WAR?

[Captioner] 23:03:38
AND WHO IS STILL HOLDING EVEN 

[Captioner] 23:03:41
TODAY AS WE SPEAK THOSE INNOCENT 

[Captioner] 23:03:43
HOSTAGES INCLUDING KIDS, TEENS, 

[Captioner] 23:03:45
MOMS, DADS, AND DOING HORRIFIC 

[Captioner] 23:03:47
THINGS TO THEM WHILE IN 

[Captioner] 23:03:47
CAPTIVITY?

[Captioner] 23:03:50
THE THIRD QUESTION IS -- OR 

[Captioner] 23:03:51
MAYBE SOMETHING WE SHOULD ASK 

[Captioner] 23:03:52
YOURSELF IS BY SUPPORTING THIS 

[Captioner] 23:03:54
RESOLUTION OR THIS STATEMENT, 

[Captioner] 23:03:56
ARE YOU INDIRECTLY SUPPORTING 

[Captioner] 23:04:00
THE HAMAS ON THOSE HORRIFIC ACTS 

[Captioner] 23:04:02
TO THOSE INNOCENT SOULS?

[Captioner] 23:04:06
SO PLEASE DON'T GET FOOLED BY

[Captioner] 23:04:12
 THE --

[Captioner] 23:04:15
>> HELLO, MY NAME IS AFIFA, I'M 

[Captioner] 23:04:15
A HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR.

[Captioner] 23:04:17
THIS IS MY SECOND TIME SPEAKING 

[Captioner] 23:04:19
HERE AND MY ONLY QUESTION IS, 

[Captioner] 23:04:20
HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE FOR A 

[Captioner] 23:04:21
CEASE FIRE?

[Captioner] 23:04:23
I'M TIRED OF OPENING MY GOOGLE 

[Captioner] 23:04:25
FEED AND SEEING PICTURES OF 

[Captioner] 23:04:25
WOUNDED CHILDREN.

[Captioner] 23:04:27
IMAGINE IF THAT CHILD WAS YOURS, 

[Captioner] 23:04:28
WHAT WOULD YOU DO?

[Captioner] 23:04:29
WOULD YOU LET THEM DIE?

[Captioner] 23:04:31
OR SAVE THEIR LIFE?

[Captioner] 23:04:33
OUR TAX DOLLARS ARE BEING USED 

[Captioner] 23:04:34
TO FUND THIS GENOCIDE.

[Captioner] 23:04:36
PLEASE LISTEN TO OUR VOICES AND 

[Captioner] 23:04:37
PASS THE CEASE FIRE RESOLUTION.

[Captioner] 23:04:38
THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 23:04:45
>> HELLO, MAYOR MEI AND COUNCIL 

[Captioner] 23:04:45
MEMBERS.

[Captioner] 23:04:47
THANK YOU, COUNCILMEMBER 

[Captioner] 23:04:48
CAMPBELL, FOR BRINGING FORWARD 

[Captioner] 23:04:49
THIS RESOLUTION.

[Captioner] 23:04:52
BUT THIS PROPOSED RESOLUTION IS 

[Captioner] 23:04:52
VERY INADEQUATE.

[Captioner] 23:04:55
WE WANT TO CALL FOR ALL 

[Captioner] 23:04:56
HOSTILITIES TO END, A CEASE FIRE 

[Captioner] 23:04:57
TO STOP THIS MADNESS.

[Captioner] 23:05:02
WHAT IS DIVISIVE ABOUT

[Captioner] 23:05:04
 SEIZING FIRE?

[Captioner] 23:05:06
31,000 PEOPLE HAVE DIED, IT IS 

[Captioner] 23:05:07
OUR TAX DOLLARS.

[Captioner] 23:05:09
I DON'T WANT ANY BLOOD ON MY 

[Captioner] 23:05:10
HANDS WHICH I HAVE RIGHT NOW.

[Captioner] 23:05:12
THIS IS A VERY LOCAL ISSUE.

[Captioner] 23:05:14
WHEN IT IS IMPACTING YOUR 

[Captioner] 23:05:14
CONSTITUENTS.

[Captioner] 23:05:16
PEOPLE ARE LOSING FAMILY MEMBERS DAILY.

[Captioner] 23:05:18
IF MY JEWISH FRIENDS HAD LOST 

[Captioner] 23:05:20
FAMILY MEMBERS, WOULD THEY STAY 

[Captioner] 23:05:20
QUIET?

[Captioner] 23:05:23
SOMEONE SAYS HAMAS IS TAKING THE 

[Captioner] 23:05:23
AID.

[Captioner] 23:05:27
I HAVE SEEN VIDEOS OF ISRAELIS 

[Captioner] 23:05:29
STOPPING TRUCKS FROM ENTERING 

[Captioner] 23:05:29
GAZA.

[Captioner] 23:05:33
WE CALL IT WAR.

[Captioner] 23:05:36
IS IT A WAR WHEN PEOPLE ARE ONLY 

[Captioner] 23:05:38
DYING ON ONE SIDE IN SUCH BIG 

[Captioner] 23:05:38
NUMBERS?

[Captioner] 23:05:41
IF ANYTHING THIS IS MAKING MY 

[Captioner] 23:05:43
JEWISH COUSINS THAT ARE ALL 

[Captioner] 23:05:43
SITTING HERE UNSAFE.

[Captioner] 23:05:49
ONE PALESTINIAN 6 YEARS

[Captioner] 23:06:02
PERSPECTIVE HERE AND TO REMIND 

[Captioner] 23:06:04

[Captioner] 23:06:17

COUNTRY?

[Captioner] 23:06:20
SHAME ON YOU.

[Captioner] 23:06:22
EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU.

[Captioner] 23:06:28
ISRAEL WAS SATANICALLY 

[Captioner] 23:06:30
DEMONICALLY ATTACKED AND THE 

[Captioner] 23:06:33
TERRORISTS WERE SHARING ONLINE, 

[Captioner] 23:06:35
MOM, I KILLED 10 JEWS WITH MY 

[Captioner] 23:06:35
OWN HANDS.

[Captioner] 23:06:41
WHILE CHANTING ALLAH

[Captioner] 23:06:44
 IS GREAT.

[Captioner] 23:06:47
THEY HIT A HORNET'S NEST, THEY 

[Captioner] 23:06:48
WOKE A SLEEPING LION.

[Captioner] 23:06:49
NOW THEY CRY WOLF.

[Captioner] 23:06:56

FREMONT, I AM SADDENED TO SEE 

[Captioner] 23:07:27
FIRSTHAND THE GROWING DIVIDE AND 

[Captioner] 23:07:28
HATE AMONG OUR COMMUNITY.

[Captioner] 23:07:32
A HATE THAT HAS BEEN ALLOWED TO 

[Captioner] 23:07:36
SPROUT AND GROW DUE TO SPREADING 

[Captioner] 23:07:37
DISINFORMATION IN BOTH THE 

[Captioner] 23:07:39
MIDDLE EAST AND UNITED STATES.

[Captioner] 23:07:43
A GROWING HATE THAT HAS CAUSED 

[Captioner] 23:07:46
THESE NEVER-ENDING WARS, WARS 

[Captioner] 23:07:49
HAVE OCCURRED BEFORE OCTOBER 7TH 

[Captioner] 23:07:50
AND THAT ARE OCCURRING NOW.

[Captioner] 23:07:55
A GROWING HATE THAT UNIVERSITIES 

[Captioner] 23:07:58
ARE ALLOWING AND THIS IS 

[Captioner] 23:08:00
SOMETHING THAT A CEASE FIRE IS 

[Captioner] 23:08:01
NOT GOING TO SOLVE.

[Captioner] 23:08:01
THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 23:08:31
>> I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR 

[Captioner] 23:08:31
HEARING THESE COMMENTS.

[Captioner] 23:08:35
HAMAS' ATROCITIES IN THE LAST 

[Captioner] 23:08:36
FEW DECADES HAVE BEEN TALKED 

[Captioner] 23:08:39
ABOUT A LOT, EXPLODING BUSES, 

[Captioner] 23:08:41
CAFES AND HOTELS, FIRING TENS OF 

[Captioner] 23:08:44
THOUSANDS OF ROCKETS, MORTAR 

[Captioner] 23:08:46
SHELLS AND FIRE BALLOONS FROM 

[Captioner] 23:08:49
POPULATED AREAS IN GAZA INTO 

[Captioner] 23:08:51
POPULATED AREAS IN ISRAEL, A 

[Captioner] 23:08:52
DOUBLE WAR CRIME, STABBING AND 

[Captioner] 23:08:54
SHOOTING, BEHEADING AND BURNING 

[Captioner] 23:08:56
ALIVE OF CHILDREN AND ADULTS, 

[Captioner] 23:08:59
RAPING, MUTILATION, KIDNAPPING 

[Captioner] 23:09:00
240 PEOPLE TO GAZA RANGING FROM 

[Captioner] 23:09:02
FEW MONTHS OLD TO 86 YEARS OLD.

[Captioner] 23:09:05
STEALING AID FROM GAZANS.

[Captioner] 23:09:07
DESPITE ALL THAT AND AS A MATTER 

[Captioner] 23:09:09
OF PRINCIPLE, I BELIEVE 

[Captioner] 23:09:10
MUNICIPALITIES HAVE NO BUSINESS 

[Captioner] 23:09:11
ISSUING STATEMENTS ON FOREIGN 

[Captioner] 23:09:11
AFFAIRS.

[Captioner] 23:09:14
THE FURTHER OUR GOVERNMENT IS IN 

[Captioner] 23:09:15
CHARGE OF THAT.

[Captioner] 23:09:17
ISSUING SUCH STATEMENTS DIVIDES 

[Captioner] 23:09:19
THE LOCAL COMMUNITY AND BRINGS 

[Captioner] 23:09:20
MORE HARM THAN GOOD.

[Captioner] 23:09:22
HAVING SAID THAT, AND IF A 

[Captioner] 23:09:24
STATEMENT MUST BE ISSUED, THE 

[Captioner] 23:09:26
PROPOSED STATEMENT SEEMS 

[Captioner] 23:09:27
BALANCED AND WELL WORDED.

[Captioner] 23:09:27
THANK YOU.

CITIZEN.

[Captioner] 23:09:42
THE STATEMENT IS BEAUTIFULLY 

[Captioner] 23:09:43
WRITTEN AND PUTTING AN EMPHASIS 

[Captioner] 23:09:45
ON PEACE ALLOWS US FOR A BETTER 

[Captioner] 23:09:45
FUTURE.

[Captioner] 23:09:47
NONETHELESS IN ANY STATEMENT 

[Captioner] 23:09:48
REGARDING NATIONAL AFFAIRS IN 

[Captioner] 23:09:49
ISRAEL REGION THERE ARE THREE 

[Captioner] 23:09:50
NOTES THAT SHOULD BE ADDRESSED.

[Captioner] 23:09:53
ISRAEL'S RIGHT TO EXIST, 

[Captioner] 23:09:56
REMOVING HAMAS, A TERRORIST 

[Captioner] 23:09:57
ORGANIZATION, DECLARED BY U.S. 

[Captioner] 23:09:58
GOVERNMENT FROM POWER, AND ON 

[Captioner] 23:10:00
TOP OF EVERYTHING, RELEASING 

[Captioner] 23:10:01
CIVILIAN HOSTAGES.

BE SURPRISED HOW MANY TIMES 

[Captioner] 23:10:08
THESE SIMPLE STATEMENTS HAVE 

[Captioner] 23:10:09
BEEN CHALLENGED.

[Captioner] 23:10:12
THE HORRIBLE SITUATION IN GAZA 

[Captioner] 23:10:14
IS UNQUESTIONABLE YET HAMAS IS 

[Captioner] 23:10:15

[Captioner] 23:10:17
IN JEOPARDY WHILE FIGHTING FROM 

[Captioner] 23:10:17
THE TUNNELS UNDERGROUND.

[Captioner] 23:10:20
THIS IS OUT OF THE COUNCIL'S 

[Captioner] 23:10:23
SCOPE OF WORK BUT IF YOU HAVE TO 

[Captioner] 23:10:25
ADDRESS IT, MAKE SURE YOU HAVE 

[Captioner] 23:10:27

[Captioner] 23:10:51
MOUNTAIN VIEW CITY COUNCIL 

[Captioner] 23:10:55
REJECTED ANY CEASE FIRE 

[Captioner] 23:10:56
RESOLUTION BECAUSE THEIR COUNCIL 

[Captioner] 23:10:57
DIDN'T SURRENDER TO THE MOB.

[Captioner] 23:10:58
LET'S BE HONEST.

[Captioner] 23:11:01
THIS CITY COUNCIL WAS SILENT 

[Captioner] 23:11:04
LAST WEEK, WHEN 287 KIDS WERE

UKRAINE, 500 IN SUDAN, AND 

[Captioner] 23:11:13

[Captioner] 23:11:17
THE MIDDLE EAST AND JEWS.

[Captioner] 23:11:21

[Captioner] 23:13:04
HAMAS IS A CRIMINAL 

[Captioner] 23:13:04

MILITARY OPERATION TO RESCUE 

[Captioner] 23:13:30
HOSTAGES LIKE THIS LITTLE BOY.

[Captioner] 23:13:33
THE HAMAS FOLKS ARE VERY 

[Captioner] 23:13:33
DANGEROUS.

[Captioner] 23:13:35
THEY STAND AGAINST EVERYTHING WE 

[Captioner] 23:13:36

[Captioner] 23:13:38
AGAINST FREEDOM, AGAINST 

[Captioner] 23:13:41

COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL.

[Captioner] 23:13:52
ON BALANCE, HOWEVER, YOU SHOULD

BE WIPED OUT.

[Captioner] 23:14:39
31,000 INNOCENT MEN, WOMEN AND 

[Captioner] 23:14:44
CHILDREN IN GAZA HAVE BEEN 

[Captioner] 23:14:45
KILLED, ACCORDING TO THE U.N., 

[Captioner] 23:14:46
MORE CHILDREN WERE KILLED IN

FOUR MONTHS OF WAR ON GAZA THAN 

[Captioner] 23:14:49
IN FOUR YEARS OF WAR AROUND THE 

[Captioner] 23:14:49
WORLD.

[Captioner] 23:14:51
THERE HASN'T BEEN A SINGLE DAY 

[Captioner] 23:14:53
SINCE OCTOBER 7TH THAT ISRAEL 

[Captioner] 23:14:54
HASN'T KILLED A PALESTINIAN BABY 

[Captioner] 23:14:54
OR CHILD.

[Captioner] 23:14:56
THE U.N. ALSO REPORTED THAT THIS 

[Captioner] 23:14:58
IS THE FASTEST DECLINE IN A 

[Captioner] 23:14:59
POPULATION'S NUTRITION STATUS 

[Captioner] 23:15:00

FIRE AND DE-ESCALATION OF 

[Captioner] 23:15:16
VIOLENCE IN GAZA.

[Captioner] 23:15:18
THE CALL FOR CEASE FIRE HAS BEEN 

[Captioner] 23:15:19
A LOCALLY MOBILIZED EFFORT 

[Captioner] 23:15:20
WITHIN THE FREMONT COMMUNITY.

[Captioner] 23:15:33
>> HELLO CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS 

[Captioner] 23:15:33

[Captioner] 23:15:35
I'VE HEARD A FEW PEOPLE HERE

I ASK, WHERE IS THE HUMANITY, 

[Captioner] 23:15:49
AND WHY ARE THEY TRYING TO HIDE 

[Captioner] 23:15:49
THIS?

[Captioner] 23:15:52
SCAPEGOATING OTHERS INSTEAD OF 

[Captioner] 23:15:54
ACKNOWLEDGING ISRAEL'S OVER 75 

[Captioner] 23:15:55
YEARS OF OPPRESSION, ABUSE AND 

[Captioner] 23:15:57
LAND THEFT THAT IS STILL ONGOING 

[Captioner] 23:15:59
AND ON FULL DISPLAY TO THE WORLD 

[Captioner] 23:16:00

AUDACITY AND GAL TO SAY DON'T

PLEASE REMEMBER THE WORDS OF THE

[Captioner] 23:17:30
TOPIC TO THE AGENDA.

[Captioner] 23:17:32
HOWEVER, WHAT WE NEED IS A 

[Captioner] 23:17:33
RESOLUTION TO CALL FOR PERMANENT 

[Captioner] 23:17:35
CEASE-FIRE TO PROVIDE 

[Captioner] 23:17:36
HUMANITARIAN AID TO ENTER GAZA 

[Captioner] 23:17:36

[Captioner] 23:17:39
AS YOU CAN SEE, CAREFULLY 

[Captioner] 23:17:41
WORDING YOUR STATEMENT TO BE NOT 

[Captioner] 23:17:42
DECISIVE DID THE EXACT OPPOSITE 

[Captioner] 23:17:44
AND THE LACK OF RESEARCH AND 

[Captioner] 23:17:46
TERMINOLOGY ON THIS TOPIC IS 

[Captioner] 23:17:46
EXTREMELY WORRYING.

[Captioner] 23:17:50
I HOPE YOU DO YOUR RESEARCH AND 

[Captioner] 23:17:51
CLAIM -- BY WHO HAVE STOOD 

[Captioner] 23:17:52
BEFORE HERE THAT THERE ARE MANY 

[Captioner] 23:17:54
THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN SAID

COMPLETELY FALSE AND IN ORDER TO 

[Captioner] 23:17:58
JUSTIFY THEIR INNOCENCE THEY'RE 

[Captioner] 23:17:59
SPREADING MISINFORMATION.

[Captioner] 23:18:01
WE CANNOT CALL THIS SITUATION A 

[Captioner] 23:18:02
CONFLICT WHEN ISRAEL ATTACKS AND 

[Captioner] 23:18:07

THAT IS AN IMPORTANT 

[Captioner] 23:18:55
DISTINCTION.

[Captioner] 23:21:44
>> DEAR MAYOR AND COUNCIL 

[Captioner] 23:21:46
MEMBERS, MY NAME IS YASSIN.

[Captioner] 23:21:48
I'VE BEEN A LONG TIME RESIDENT 

[Captioner] 23:21:49
OF FREMONT, ABOUT 20 YEARS NOW.

[Captioner] 23:21:51
MY KIDS HAVE GONE TO SCHOOLS 

[Captioner] 23:21:51
HERE.

[Captioner] 23:21:56
IN JUST THE PAST 24 HOURS, 

[Captioner] 23:22:00
OCCUPYING FORCES RAIDED AL

[Captioner] 23:22:02
 SHI VA HOSPITAL, KILLED ABOUT 

[Captioner] 23:22:04
100 CIVILIANS, THEY ARRESTED 

[Captioner] 23:22:06
DOCTOR, THEY ARRESTED 

[Captioner] 23:22:08
JOURNALISTS, AND THEY ALSO -- 

[Captioner] 23:22:11
YOU KNOW, THEY'VE SHUT DOWN THE 

[Captioner] 23:22:11
HOSPITAL COMPLETELY.

[Captioner] 23:22:13
NOT ONLY THEY ARE KILLING THE 

[Captioner] 23:22:15
PEOPLE, BUT THEY ARE NOT EVEN 

[Captioner] 23:22:16
ALLOWING THESE INJURED PEOPLE TO 

[Captioner] 23:22:17
BE TREATED IN THE HOSPITALS.

[Captioner] 23:22:22
SO YOU KNOW, I'VE SEEN THE 

[Captioner] 23:22:22
RESOLUTION.

[Captioner] 23:22:24
WE NEED TO CALL FOR A COMPLETE 

[Captioner] 23:22:24
CEASE FIRE.

[Captioner] 23:22:26
UNLESS THAT CEASE FIRE HAPPENS, 

[Captioner] 23:22:33
THEY -- WE CANNOT LET INNOCENT 

[Captioner] 23:22:35
MEN, WOMEN, CHILDREN TO BE DYING 

[Captioner] 23:22:35
EVERY DAY.

[Captioner] 23:22:38
AS I TOLD YOU, ABOUT A HUNDRED 

[Captioner] 23:22:39
CHILDREN ARE BEING KILLED EVERY 

[Captioner] 23:22:41
SINGLE DAY SINCE THE BEGINNING 

[Captioner] 23:22:41
OF -- IN THE PAST FIVE MONTHS.

[Captioner] 23:22:44
AND I WANT TO REMIND YOU ALL 

[Captioner] 23:22:46
THAT THIS DID NOT START ON 

[Captioner] 23:22:46
OCTOBER 7TH.

[Captioner] 23:22:48
THIS HAS BEEN GOING FOR 75 

[Captioner] 23:22:48
YEARS.

[Captioner] 23:22:51
THEY HAVE BEEN KILLING AND 

[Captioner] 23:22:54
OCCUPYING HOUSES IN WEST BANK 

[Captioner] 23:22:55
BUT THERE IS NO HAMAS PRESENCE.

[Captioner] 23:22:58
SO THIS HIDING BEHIND HAMAS AND 

[Captioner] 23:22:59
TRYING TO KILL THE INNOCENT 

[Captioner] 23:23:03
PEOPLE, YOU KNOW, I

[Captioner] 23:23:08
 DON'T --

[Captioner] 23:23:12
>> DEAR MAYOR AND COUNCIL 

[Captioner] 23:23:14
MEMBERS, THANK YOU FOR THE TIME 

[Captioner] 23:23:17
THAT YOU TAKE TO WRITE A 

[Captioner] 23:23:19
RESPECTFUL STATEMENT ABOUT THE 

[Captioner] 23:23:19
ISRAEL PALESTINIAN CONFLICT.

[Captioner] 23:23:21
IT WARMS MY HEART.

[Captioner] 23:23:26
215,000 ISRAELIS HAVE BEEN 

[Captioner] 23:23:28
DISPLACED BY HAMAS AND HEZBOLLAH 

[Captioner] 23:23:29
AGGRESSION AND CANNOT RETURN TO 

[Captioner] 23:23:31
THEIR HOMES THAT WERE BURNED AND 

[Captioner] 23:23:32
DAMAGED BY ROCKETS.

[Captioner] 23:23:35
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ARE 

[Captioner] 23:23:36
STILL IN THE HOSPITAL, HURT AND 

[Captioner] 23:23:41
WOUNDED, TRYING TO HEAL FROM

[Captioner] 23:23:41
 HAMAS' CRUEL ACTIONS.

[Captioner] 23:23:44
MILLIONS OF CHILDREN IN ISRAEL 

[Captioner] 23:23:48
CANNOT GO TO SCHOOLS BECAUSE THE 

[Captioner] 23:23:49
ROCKETS HAMAS LAUNCHES ALMOST 

[Captioner] 23:23:50
EVERY DAY AND BECAUSE THEY 

[Captioner] 23:23:52
TARGET SCHOOL, KINDERGARTEN AND 

[Captioner] 23:23:52
PUBLIC REGIONS.

[Captioner] 23:23:56
THE PEOPLE OF ISRAEL DESERVE A 

[Captioner] 23:23:57
PLACE TOO.

[Captioner] 23:23:59
PLEASE ACKNOWLEDGE ISRAEL IS 

[Captioner] 23:23:59
SUFFERING AS WELL.

[Captioner] 23:24:03
WE WANT SUSTAINABLE PEACE IN THE 

[Captioner] 23:24:03
MIDDLE EAST REGION.

[Captioner] 23:24:04
THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 23:24:06
>> Ms. Gauthier: MAY WE HAVE 

[Captioner] 23:24:06
YOUR NAME?

[Captioner] 23:24:08
>> SARIT.

[Captioner] 23:24:08
>> Ms. Gauthier: THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 23:24:15
>> MY NAME IS ESTHER.

[Captioner] 23:24:18
THE RESOLUTION IS MOTIVATED BY 

[Captioner] 23:24:20
ATTITUDES ABOUT FOREIGN AFFAIRS, 

[Captioner] 23:24:22
WHICH ARE EXCLUSIVELY THE 

[Captioner] 23:24:24
JURISDICTION OF THE FEDERAL 

[Captioner] 23:24:24
GOVERNMENT.

[Captioner] 23:24:27
IT TAKES A POSITION IN FOREIGN 

[Captioner] 23:24:29
AFFAIRS, ESPECIALLY IN USE OF 

[Captioner] 23:24:31
THE TERM PALESTINE, WHICH IS 

[Captioner] 23:24:33
USED TO DALLY JIT MIEZ ISRAEL'S 

[Captioner] 23:24:34
RIGHT TO EXIST AND THE RIGHT OF 

[Captioner] 23:24:36
JEWS TO LIVE IN ISRAEL.

[Captioner] 23:24:39
IN USING THE TERM PALESTINE, THE 

[Captioner] 23:24:41
RESOLUTION CONCERNS ITSELF WITH 

[Captioner] 23:24:42
THE U.S.-ISRAEL RELATIONSHIP.

[Captioner] 23:24:45
PEACE IS WHAT HOPEFULLY MANY OF 

[Captioner] 23:24:47
US WANT, BUT IN SINGLING OUT THE 

[Captioner] 23:24:50
AREA, IT CALLS PALESTINE THE 

[Captioner] 23:24:51
RESOLUTION IS DISCRIMINATORY AND 

[Captioner] 23:24:52
TARGET THE STATE OF ISRAEL.

[Captioner] 23:24:54
THIS TARGETING IS BY DEFINITION 

[Captioner] 23:24:56
A FORM OF ANTISEMITISM.

[Captioner] 23:25:00
A PROCLAMATION AGAINST 

[Captioner] 23:25:01
ANTISEMITISM AND ANY TYPE OF 

[Captioner] 23:25:03
HATE CAN BE MADE WITHOUT TAKING 

[Captioner] 23:25:04
AN ATTITUDE ON A FOREIGN WAR.

[Captioner] 23:25:08
THE RESOLUTION IS NOT HELPFUL IN 

[Captioner] 23:25:10
DIMINISHING ANTISEMITISM OR 

[Captioner] 23:25:13
DIVISIVENESS AND THEREBY DOES 

[Captioner] 23:25:13
NOT PROMOTE PEACE HERE.

[Captioner] 23:25:20
>> HI.

[Captioner] 23:25:21
HELLO?

[Captioner] 23:25:23
MY NAME IS FATIMA.

[Captioner] 23:25:26
I LIVE IN NEWARK BUT MY SON GOES 

[Captioner] 23:25:27
TO FREMONT HERE IN SCHOOL, IN 

[Captioner] 23:25:28
PRIVATE SCHOOL.

[Captioner] 23:25:32
I'VE BEEN A RESIDENT IN FREMONT 

[Captioner] 23:25:34
BACK AND NEWARK FOR 15 YEARS.

[Captioner] 23:25:36
WE LOVE THIS AREA.

[Captioner] 23:25:37
WE SEE PEACE IN THIS AREA.

[Captioner] 23:25:39
WE WANT THE SAME FOR EVERYBODY 

[Captioner] 23:25:40
AROUND THE WORLD.

[Captioner] 23:25:43
A LOT OF PEOPLE TALK ABOUT BEING 

[Captioner] 23:25:46
DIVISIVE IF WE SAID CEASE FIRE, 

[Captioner] 23:25:47
I DON'T SEE HOW SAVING LIFE, HOW 

[Captioner] 23:25:49
IT CAN BE DIVISIVE.

[Captioner] 23:25:51
I THINK FIRST GOAL TO ACHIEVE 

[Captioner] 23:25:53
ANY PEACE IT HAS TO BE 

[Captioner] 23:25:54
CEASE-FIRE, SECOND, IT HAS TO BE 

[Captioner] 23:25:54
JUSTICE.

[Captioner] 23:25:57
EVERYTHING IN THE PALESTINE 

[Captioner] 23:25:59
ISRAEL NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED AND 

[Captioner] 23:26:01
JUST AS NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED 

[Captioner] 23:26:02
FOR THE PALESTINIANS AND WHEN 

[Captioner] 23:26:03
JUSTICE HAPPENS THEN PEACE WILL 

[Captioner] 23:26:03
HAPPEN.

[Captioner] 23:26:04
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

[Captioner] 23:26:07
>> Ms. Gauthier: THANK YOU.

 GOLITA ROBLE.

[Captioner] 23:26:19
>> HI.

[Captioner] 23:26:23
COUNCILMEMBERS, STAFF, IT'S 

[Captioner] 23:26:23
VERY, VERY LATE.

[Captioner] 23:26:27
I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE ONE THING, 

[Captioner] 23:26:28
TWO JEWISH LADIES GAVE ME THIS 

[Captioner] 23:26:30
FOOD TO OPEN MY FAST WITH.

[Captioner] 23:26:33
WE LIVE IN THE HAPPIEST CITY IN 

[Captioner] 23:26:34
THE WORLD.

[Captioner] 23:26:35
AND WE ARE DIVIDED.

[Captioner] 23:26:39
WE ARE DIVIDED BETWEEN MUSLIMS 

[Captioner] 23:26:41
AND JEWS, AND THERE WAS A HINDU 

[Captioner] 23:26:43
VOICE TOO IN IT.

[Captioner] 23:26:45
WE DON'T NEED TO BE DIVIDED.

[Captioner] 23:26:48
WE WANT THE HOSTAGES RELEASED.

[Captioner] 23:26:49
WE WANT A CEASE FIRE.

[Captioner] 23:26:52
WE WANT FOOD TO BE SENT, AS A 

[Captioner] 23:26:55
MATTER OF FACT, WE SHOULD HAVE A 

[Captioner] 23:26:58
CONFERENCE OF MUSLIMS, HINDUS, 

[Captioner] 23:27:01
SIKHS, JEWS, ALL IN FREMONT, AND 

[Captioner] 23:27:03
WE SHOULD FIGURE OUT HOW TO 

[Captioner] 23:27:05
BRING PEACE TO THE MIDDLE EAST.

[Captioner] 23:27:08
IF THE PEOPLE ARE READY AND 

[Captioner] 23:27:10
WILLING, WE WILL HAVE A 

[Captioner] 23:27:13
CONFERENCE HERE, AND I WILL HEAD 

[Captioner] 23:27:16
THAT CONFERENCE TO HAVE A PEACE 

[Captioner] 23:27:16
TALK.

[Captioner] 23:27:19
DON'T DESTROY THE BEAUTY OF 

[Captioner] 23:27:19
FREMONT.

[Captioner] 23:27:21
WE ARE THE HAPPIEST PLACE ON THE 

[Captioner] 23:27:21
EARTH.

[Captioner] 23:27:21
THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 23:27:38

[Captioner] 23:27:42
, MOHAMMAD, AHMED.

[Captioner] 23:27:47
>> CAN YOU HEAR ME?

[Captioner] 23:27:47
>> Ms. Gauthier: YES.

[Captioner] 23:27:48
 --

[Captioner] 23:27:52
>> MY NAME IS GOUL DP ROBLE.

[Captioner] 23:27:53
I'M A FATHER OF FIVE CHILDREN.

[Captioner] 23:27:55
IT'S REALLY HEARTBREAKING THAT 

[Captioner] 23:27:58
WE'RE DISCUSSING ABOUT SAVING 

[Captioner] 23:27:58
LIFE.

[Captioner] 23:28:01
I WAS IN SANTA CRUZ THIS 

[Captioner] 23:28:05
SATURDAY AT 6:00 A.M., AND WE 

[Captioner] 23:28:08
LAID LITERALLY 14,000 CHILDREN'S 

[Captioner] 23:28:11
CLOTHES ON THE COAST, AND 

[Captioner] 23:28:15
IMAGINING THAT ONCE YOU SEE THAT 

[Captioner] 23:28:16
ON A DRONE WHERE YOU SEE THE 

[Captioner] 23:28:17
PICTURES, WHAT WOULD YOU DO?

[Captioner] 23:28:18
THE CHILD HAS NO CHOICE.

[Captioner] 23:28:21
WHERE CAN THEY HIDE?

[Captioner] 23:28:22
ONE SIDE IS THE OCEAN AND THE 

[Captioner] 23:28:23
OTHER ONE IS THE BOMB.

[Captioner] 23:28:25
SO REMEMBER THIS.

[Captioner] 23:28:29
I MEAN, IT'S JUST SIMPLE, IT'S 

[Captioner] 23:28:29
NOT COMPLICATED.

[Captioner] 23:28:31
A CEASE FIRE, WHEN DOES THAT 

[Captioner] 23:28:32
REALLY BECOME A COMPLICATED 

[Captioner] 23:28:32
ISSUE?

[Captioner] 23:28:36
ONCE YOU GET A CEASE FIRE -- I'M 

[Captioner] 23:28:41
ORIGINALLY A SOMALI, AT LEAST WE 

[Captioner] 23:28:42
HAD FOOD DURING THE WAR, AT 

[Captioner] 23:28:43
LEAST THEY HAVE WATER.

[Captioner] 23:28:45
IN GAZA, THERE'S NO WATER, 

[Captioner] 23:28:45
THERE'S NO FOOD.

[Captioner] 23:28:50
KIDS

[Captioner] 23:28:53
 ARE --

[Captioner] 23:28:56
>> I REJECT THE HARMFUL RACIST 

[Captioner] 23:28:57
AND DIVISIVE STATEMENT AND I 

[Captioner] 23:28:58
URGE THE REST OF THE COUNCIL TO 

[Captioner] 23:28:58
DO THE SAME.

[Captioner] 23:29:03
HOW DARE YOU SAY YOU CARE ABOUT 

[Captioner] 23:29:06
OVER 15,000 DEAD CHILDREN, 

[Captioner] 23:29:09
25,000 ORPHAN CHILDREN, AND NOW 

[Captioner] 23:29:11
800,000 STARVING CHILDREN, AND 

[Captioner] 23:29:12
YET NOT SAY CEASE FIRE?

[Captioner] 23:29:15
INSTEAD OF JUMBLING YOUR WORDS 

[Captioner] 23:29:17
WHEN ASKED WHO YOU TALK TO IN 

[Captioner] 23:29:18
OUR COMMUNITY, I URGE YOU TO 

[Captioner] 23:29:20
ACTUALLY TALK TO OUR COMMUNITY.

[Captioner] 23:29:23
HAVE A DIALOGUE WITH COMMUNITY 

[Captioner] 23:29:24
ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS THE 

[Captioner] 23:29:26
COUNCIL ON AMERICAN ISLAMIC 

[Captioner] 23:29:28
RELATIONS AND ARAB RESOURCE 

[Captioner] 23:29:30
ORGANIZATION CENTER TO COME UP 

[Captioner] 23:29:31
WITH A STATEMENT THAT'S 

[Captioner] 23:29:32
REPRESENTATIVE OF WHAT YOUR 

[Captioner] 23:29:33
MUSLIM POPULATION WANT.

[Captioner] 23:29:35
THIS IS A LOCAL ISSUE.

[Captioner] 23:29:38
DON'T ALLOW RACISTS AND BIGOTS 

[Captioner] 23:29:39
TO TELL YOU OTHERWISE.

[Captioner] 23:29:41
YOU'RE SITTING HERE BEGGING THE 

[Captioner] 23:29:43
COUNTY FOR MONEY YET YOU SENT 

[Captioner] 23:29:44
$2.7 MILLION TO ISRAEL EVERY 

[Captioner] 23:29:45
YEAR TO SLAUGHTER CHILDREN.

[Captioner] 23:29:50
WE DEMAND THE BARE MINIMUM, A 

[Captioner] 23:29:52
CLEAR CEASE FIRE RESOLUTION BE 

[Captioner] 23:29:53
DRAFTED FROM THE RIVER TO THE 

[Captioner] 23:29:54
SEA, PALESTINE WILL BE FREE.

[Captioner] 23:29:58

[Captioner] 23:30:08
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY.

[Captioner] 23:30:10
WE'RE GOING TO RESUME BECAUSE WE 

[Captioner] 23:30:12
END AT 11:30, I'M GOING TO ASK 

[Captioner] 23:30:14
FOR A CONTINUANCE IF I HAVE THAT 

[Captioner] 23:30:15
FROM THE COUNCIL, BECAUSE 

[Captioner] 23:30:16
ORIGINALLY WE END AT 11:30.

[Captioner] 23:30:18
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO ASK FOR 

[Captioner] 23:30:19
CONTINUANCE.

[Captioner] 23:30:20
I'M GOING TO SAY 15 MINUTES, 

[Captioner] 23:30:21
WE'RE GOING TO ASK FOR THAT.

[Captioner] 23:30:22
I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY SPEAKERS 

[Captioner] 23:30:24
WE HAVE LEFT, BUT IT'S 11:30.

[Captioner] 23:30:27
SO HOW MANY SPEAKERS DO WE HAVE 

[Captioner] 23:30:28
LEFT AT THIS TIME?

[Captioner] 23:30:29
>> Ms. Gauthier: I BELIEVE 

[Captioner] 23:30:29
NINE.

[Captioner] 23:30:31
>> Mayor Mei: WILL THAT BE 

[Captioner] 23:30:31
ENOUGH TIME?

[Captioner] 23:30:32
15 MINUTES?

[Captioner] 23:30:32
OKAY.

[Captioner] 23:30:34
>>

[Captioner] 23:30:35
>> Councilmember Salwan: MAYOR, 

[Captioner] 23:30:36
I THINK WE SHOULD EXTEND THE 

[Captioner] 23:30:37
TIME AND GET THIS WRAPPED UP.

[Captioner] 23:30:39
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY, WE'LL EXTEND 

[Captioner] 23:30:39
TIEMENT TO WRAP THIS UP.

[Captioner] 23:30:40
THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 23:30:41
CONTINUE WITH THAT.

[Captioner] 23:30:44
MOTION BY COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN, 

[Captioner] 23:30:45
AND SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER 

[Captioner] 23:30:45
COX.

[Captioner] 23:30:51
>> Ms. Gauthier: MOTION TO DO 

[Captioner] 23:30:51
THAT?

[Captioner] 23:30:53
I'M SORRY, I WAS JUST ASKING IF 

[Captioner] 23:30:56
WE NEEDED A MOTION TO EXTEND.

[Captioner] 23:30:58
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: 

[Captioner] 23:30:58
TECHNICALLY YOU DO NOT NEED A 

[Captioner] 23:31:00
MOTION TO EXTEND A MEETING 

[Captioner] 23:31:01
UNLESS IT'S AFTER MIDNIGHT, SO 

[Captioner] 23:31:03
YOU CAN PROCEED WITHOUT A MOTION 

[Captioner] 23:31:05
BUT AT MIDNIGHT IF YOU GO BEYOND 

[Captioner] 23:31:07
THAT TIME, YOU CERTAINLY DO 

[Captioner] 23:31:08
BECAUSE THE MOTION IS INTENDED 

[Captioner] 23:31:09
TO CONTINUE THE MEETING UNTIL 

[Captioner] 23:31:10
THE NEXT DAY.

[Captioner] 23:31:12
SO FOR NOW YOU CAN KEEP GOING 

[Captioner] 23:31:13
AND IF YOU GET CLOSER TO 

[Captioner] 23:31:14
MIDNIGHT, THAT'S WHEN YOU CAN 

[Captioner] 23:31:15
REVISIT WHETHER YOU WANT TO 

[Captioner] 23:31:16
CONTINUE PAST THAT POINT.

[Captioner] 23:31:18
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 23:31:20
NEXT SPEAKER, PLEASE.

[Captioner] 23:31:21
>> CAN YOU LOAD THE PICTURE 

[Captioner] 23:31:22
BEFORE WE START?

[Captioner] 23:31:22
THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 23:31:26
ON OCTOBER 7TH, 1400 PEOPLE WERE 

[Captioner] 23:31:28
MASSACRED, RAPED, BEHEADED, 

[Captioner] 23:31:29
MUTILATED AND BURNED ALIVE.

[Captioner] 23:31:33
I LOST ONE FAMILY MEMBER.

[Captioner] 23:31:36
9 MONTHS OLD WHEN HE WAS 

[Captioner] 23:31:39
KIDNAPPED, HE'S NOW 164 DAYS IN 

[Captioner] 23:31:39
CAPTIVITY.

[Captioner] 23:31:42
I WANT TO THANK COUNCILMEMBER 

[Captioner] 23:31:44

[Captioner] 23:31:44
STATEMENT.

[Captioner] 23:31:48
THANK YOU FOR ALSO ADDING THE 

[Captioner] 23:31:50
ISRAELI EARLIER TO THE STATEMENT 

[Captioner] 23:31:53
IN SOME OF THE -- I ALSO WANT TO 

[Captioner] 23:31:54
THANK TERESA COX FOR 

[Captioner] 23:31:56
ACKNOWLEDGING THE ISRAELI AND 

[Captioner] 23:31:57
PALESTINIAN HATE THAT WE 

[Captioner] 23:31:58
ACTUALLY EXPERIENCE ON A DAILY 

[Captioner] 23:31:59
BASIS HERE.

[Captioner] 23:32:04
I WISH THAT THIS STATEMENT COULD 

[Captioner] 23:32:06
ACTUALLY BRING HIM BACK BUT 

[Captioner] 23:32:08
UNFORTUNATELY THE ISRAELIS WILL 

[Captioner] 23:32:09
NOT STOP GOING AND FIND HIM AND 

[Captioner] 23:32:10
RELEASE HIM.

[Captioner] 23:32:13
AS YOU ARE ALL AWARE, THERE ARE 

[Captioner] 23:32:17
RAIDS ON ANTISEMITISM IN FREMONT 

[Captioner] 23:32:20
INCLUDING A CANDIDATE FOR 

[Captioner] 23:32:24
FREMONT MAYOR

[Captioner] 23:32:27
 ON --

[Captioner] 23:32:31
>> MY NAME IS MOHAMMAD CARBI AND 

[Captioner] 23:32:34
WE ARE NOT A VIOLENT MOB AND 

[Captioner] 23:32:35
THEY DON'T HAVE ANY REASON TO 

[Captioner] 23:32:36
CALL US A VIOLENT MOB, BUT THEY 

[Captioner] 23:32:38
DON'T THINK ABOUT IT, THEY JUST 

[Captioner] 23:32:39
MAKE THINGS UP LIKE THEY ALWAYS 

[Captioner] 23:32:39
DO.

[Captioner] 23:32:43
SO -- AND SECOND THING IS, IT IS 

[Captioner] 23:32:45
AN INJUSTICE TO CALL THE 

[Captioner] 23:32:46
SITUATION IN PALESTINE A 

[Captioner] 23:32:46
CONFLICT.

[Captioner] 23:32:49
IT IS A COLONIZING FORCE 

[Captioner] 23:32:51
COMMITTING GENOCIDE OF 

[Captioner] 23:32:52
INDIGENOUS PEOPLE.

[Captioner] 23:32:54
WHEN A GENOCIDE IS GOING ON, 

[Captioner] 23:32:55
THERE ARE NO -- THERE ARE ONLY 

[Captioner] 23:32:56
TWO SIDES.

[Captioner] 23:32:58
BY STAYING NEUTRAL, YOU ARE IN 

[Captioner] 23:32:59
FAVOR OF GENOCIDE.

[Captioner] 23:33:03
STOP CALLING A GENOCIDE AN 

[Captioner] 23:33:04
INTERNATIONAL ISSUE.

[Captioner] 23:33:06
IF MILLIONS OF OUR TAX DOLLARS 

[Captioner] 23:33:08
ARE USED TO COMMIT GENOCIDE, 

[Captioner] 23:33:10
THEN IT IS OUR DUTY TO STATE 

[Captioner] 23:33:12
VERY CLEARLY THAT WE ARE AGAINST 

[Captioner] 23:33:15
GENOCIDE, AND YOU BEING OUR 

[Captioner] 23:33:16

12,000 KIDS, WE HAD ENOUGH OF

[Captioner] 23:34:20
THE GENOCIDE JUST ISN'T

[Captioner] 23:35:07
ROOM, TAKE A GOOD LOOK AT THAT 

[Captioner] 23:35:07
PICTURE.

[Captioner] 23:35:14
THEY'RE NOT TERRORISTS, THEY'VE 

[Captioner] 23:35:15
BEEN TERRORIZED.

[Captioner] 23:35:19
THE MOST SOPHISTICATED 

[Captioner] 23:35:21
TERRORISTS IN THE WORLD, 

[Captioner] 23:35:21
ISRAEL.

[Captioner] 23:35:28
CHILDREN ARE DYING.

[Captioner] 23:35:30
SOME OF THEM ARE SO HUNGRY, 

[Captioner] 23:35:30
THEY'RE EATING GRASS.

[Captioner] 23:35:34
WHAT IS SO COMPLICATED?

[Captioner] 23:35:40
TAKE A GOOD LOOK AT THAT 

[Captioner] 23:35:40
PICTURE, REALLY.

[Captioner] 23:35:41
REALLY HARD.

[Captioner] 23:35:45
THEY HAVE NO VOICE.

[Captioner] 23:35:47
WE ARE OUR VOICE.

[Captioner] 23:35:50
WE ARE THEIR VOICE.

[Captioner] 23:35:55
AND WE'RE HERE TO SPEAK UP 

[Captioner] 23:35:56
WHAT'S GOING ON AND THE 

[Captioner] 23:35:57
GENOCIDE, LET'S CALL WHAT IT 

[Captioner] 23:35:57
IS.

[Captioner] 23:36:02
>> Ms. Gauthier: THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 23:36:12
>> HELLO.

[Captioner] 23:36:16
MY NAME IS KIM MO, AND I WANTED 

[Captioner] 23:36:21
TO REMIND YOU, DESRIE CAMPBELL,

[Captioner] 23:36:25
 COUNCILMEMBER, -- LIFE 

[Captioner] 23:36:25
MATTERS.

[Captioner] 23:36:27
SO PALESTINIAN LIFE.

[Captioner] 23:36:30
PALESTINIAN LIFE IS NOT ANY LESS 

[Captioner] 23:36:30
THAN OURS.

[Captioner] 23:36:34
SO THERE ARE NO MORE WORDS TO 

[Captioner] 23:36:36
SPEAK ABOUT WHAT IS GOING ON IN 

[Captioner] 23:36:36
GAZA.

[Captioner] 23:36:40
THERE ARE NO LAWS TO BREAK 

[Captioner] 23:36:41
ANYMORE BECAUSE THE LAWS HAVE 

[Captioner] 23:36:42
BEEN BROKEN.

[Captioner] 23:36:46
THERE ARE NO MORE

[Captioner] 23:36:48
 BILLS THAT WE CAN DO TO WHAT IS 

[Captioner] 23:36:49
GOING ON IN GAZA.

[Captioner] 23:36:52
OUR COLLECTIVE HUMANITY HAS BEEN 

[Captioner] 23:36:55
FAILED, HUMAN RIGHTS HAVE SKIN 

[Captioner] 23:36:55
COLOR.

[Captioner] 23:36:57
THE DARKER YOU ARE, THE LESS 

[Captioner] 23:36:58
RIGHT YOU HAVE.

[Captioner] 23:37:02
SO BLACK LIFE MATTERS, SO DO 

[Captioner] 23:37:03
PALESTINIAN LIFE MATTERS.

[Captioner] 23:37:03
REMEMBER THAT.

[Captioner] 23:37:06
THERE'S THE GENOCIDE TAKING 

[Captioner] 23:37:08
PLACE EVERY MINUTE THAT WE ARE 

[Captioner] 23:37:10
SPEAKING, AND WHY DO WE HAVE TO 

[Captioner] 23:37:14
INVOLVE OUR MONEY INVOLVED --

[Captioner] 23:37:14
>> Ms. Gauthier: THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 23:37:28
>> Ms. Gauthier: CAN YOU PLEASE 

[Captioner] 23:37:30
STATE YOUR NAME?

[Captioner] 23:37:32
>> LADN.

[Captioner] 23:37:34
I'M AN OLDER SISTER.

[Captioner] 23:37:36
THE YOUNGEST OF MY THREE 

[Captioner] 23:37:38
SIBLINGS IS 9 YEARS OLD, BARELY 

[Captioner] 23:37:38
9 YEARS OLD.

[Captioner] 23:37:41
EVERY DAY I GO ONLINE AND I SEE 

[Captioner] 23:37:43
HORRIFIC VIDEOS AND IMAGES OF 

[Captioner] 23:37:45
CHILDREN BEING PERFORMED SURGERY 

[Captioner] 23:37:48
ON THEM WITHOUT ANESTHESIA, 

[Captioner] 23:37:51
SCREAMING IN AGONY, THEIR LIMBS 

[Captioner] 23:37:54
BLOWN OFF BY SOME AWFUL BOMB, 

[Captioner] 23:37:55
AND IT REALLY MAKES ME LOOK AT 

[Captioner] 23:37:58
MY OWN LITTLE SISTER WHO'S 9, 

[Captioner] 23:37:59
HALA, AND I REMEMBER THERE ARE 

[Captioner] 23:38:01
SO MANY OTHER PEOPLE WITH 

[Captioner] 23:38:05
SISTERS NAMED HALA, NAMED ESMA,

[Captioner] 23:38:06
 EVERYTHING, LYING DEAD AND COLD 

[Captioner] 23:38:08
UNDER THE GROUND, AND NO ONE 

[Captioner] 23:38:09
SHOULD EVER HAVE TO GO THROUGH 

[Captioner] 23:38:11
THAT KIND OF PAIN BUT HERE WE 

[Captioner] 23:38:13
ARE, NOT EVEN CONDEMNING IT.

[Captioner] 23:38:14
IN REALTIME.

[Captioner] 23:38:16
IT'S HAPPENING IN REALTIME.

[Captioner] 23:38:17
IT'S NOT A CONFLICT, IT'S NOT A 

[Captioner] 23:38:17
WAR.

[Captioner] 23:38:18
IT'S A GENOCIDE.

[Captioner] 23:38:20
AND IT NEEDS TO END.

[Captioner] 23:38:23
I ALONG WITH EVERY OTHER 

[Captioner] 23:38:24
EMPATHIZING HUMAN HERE IS ASKING 

[Captioner] 23:38:25
FOR AN IMMEDIATE CEASE FIRE.

[Captioner] 23:38:26
THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 23:38:35
>> Ms. Gauthier: I THINK WE'VE 

[Captioner] 23:38:39
MISSED HUDADH, I BELIEVE IS WHAT 

[Captioner] 23:38:40
WAS WRITTEN ON THE CARD.

[Captioner] 23:38:46
THE NEXT IS

[Captioner] 23:38:51
 SADAFF, ANWAR MIRZA, AND

[Captioner] 23:38:56
 AMBERINE KOTTER.

[Captioner] 23:39:12
PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME.

[Captioner] 23:39:18
>> MY NAME IS SADAFF, AND I HAVE 

[Captioner] 23:39:20
ONE MESSAGE TO ALL OF YOU IN 

[Captioner] 23:39:20
THIS ROOM.

[Captioner] 23:39:23
SHAME IS WHAT ALL OF YOU SHOULD 

[Captioner] 23:39:24
BE FEELING.

[Captioner] 23:39:27
I CALL FOR A CEASE FIRE AND I 

[Captioner] 23:39:28
DEMAND THAT FREMONT CALL FOR A 

[Captioner] 23:39:30
PERMANENT CEASE FIRE IN GAZA AS 

[Captioner] 23:39:30
WELL.

[Captioner] 23:39:34
YOU MAKE CONSTANT CLAIMS AGAINST 

[Captioner] 23:39:36
MUSLIMS, ARABS AND THE PEOPLE OF 

[Captioner] 23:39:38
GAZA ACCUSING US OF TERRORISM 

[Captioner] 23:39:41
AND ALL FORMS OF ATROCITIES WITH 

[Captioner] 23:39:41
BASELESS ARGUMENTS.

[Captioner] 23:39:44
THIS IS NOT AN INTERNATIONAL 

[Captioner] 23:39:46
ISSUE, IT'S AN ISSUE OF BEING A 

[Captioner] 23:39:46
HUMAN.

[Captioner] 23:39:48
THIS IS NOT A WAR THAT STARTED 

[Captioner] 23:39:51
ON OCTOBER 7TH, IT AN APARTHEID 

[Captioner] 23:39:52
GENOCIDE THAT STARTED IN 1948 

[Captioner] 23:39:52
FROM ISRAEL.

[Captioner] 23:39:55
IF YOU CARE ABOUT THE CITY OF 

[Captioner] 23:39:56
FREMONT, YOU WOULD STOP SENDING 

[Captioner] 23:39:58
OUR TAX MONEY TO SUPPORT THIS 

[Captioner] 23:39:59
GENOCIDE OF 30,000 PEOPLE.

[Captioner] 23:40:02
WHERE DOES YOUR HUMANITY LIE?

[Captioner] 23:40:04
YOU COMPARE THIS TO RUSSIA, 

[Captioner] 23:40:06
UKRAINE, SUDAN, AND HAITI, BUT 

[Captioner] 23:40:08
YOU FAIL TO REALIZE THOSE ARE 

[Captioner] 23:40:10
WARS BETWEEN TWO COUNTRIES AND 

[Captioner] 23:40:10
INTERNAL CIVIL CONFLICTS.

[Captioner] 23:40:15
WHAT IS HAPPENING IN GAZA -- 

[Captioner] 23:40:15
GENOCIDE.

[Captioner] 23:40:18
>> Mayor Mei: NEXT SPEAKER, 

[Captioner] 23:40:18
PLEASE.

[Captioner] 23:40:25
>> HELLO.

[Captioner] 23:40:28
MY NAME IS AMBERINE.

[Captioner] 23:40:30
I HAVE LIVED IN FREMONT FOR 

[Captioner] 23:40:30
ALMOST 23 YEARS NOW.

[Captioner] 23:40:34
SO I'M HERE AGAIN WITH MY 

[Captioner] 23:40:37
VIOLENT MOB AS REFERRED TO BY MY 

[Captioner] 23:40:37
FRIEND.

[Captioner] 23:40:39
WE COME HERE EVERY WEEK AND WITH 

[Captioner] 23:40:40
INCREASING NUMBER OF DEAD 

[Captioner] 23:40:40
CHILDREN.

[Captioner] 23:40:44
IT'S A GRAVEYARD FOR CHILDREN 

[Captioner] 23:40:44
RIGHT NOW.

[Captioner] 23:40:47
WHEN THE WHOLE WORLD IS ABLE TO 

[Captioner] 23:40:49
SEE THE CRIMES AND INJUSTICE, 

[Captioner] 23:40:50
WHAT IS STOPPING US FROM SEEING 

[Captioner] 23:40:51
THE TRUTH?

[Captioner] 23:40:54
IT IS TRULY SAD TO SEE FREMONT 

[Captioner] 23:40:56
BEING ONE OF THE MOST DIVERSE 

[Captioner] 23:40:57
CITIES AND THE MOST PEACEFUL 

[Captioner] 23:40:59
CITIES TAKING FOREVER TO 

[Captioner] 23:40:59
RECOGNIZE THE TRUTH.

[Captioner] 23:41:02
PLEASE LISTEN TO YOUR CONSCIENCE 

[Captioner] 23:41:04
AND MAKE THE RIGHT DECISION 

[Captioner] 23:41:04
NOW.

[Captioner] 23:41:05
WHEN YOU LISTEN TO YOUR 

[Captioner] 23:41:06
CONSCIENCE, YOU WILL KNOW WHAT 

[Captioner] 23:41:07
IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO.

[Captioner] 23:41:07
THANKS.

[Captioner] 23:41:08
BYE.

[Captioner] 23:41:19
>> HELLO, MY NAME IS ANWAR, HERE

[Captioner] 23:41:20
 FOR 10 YEARS.

[Captioner] 23:41:21
I'M HERE FOR CEASE FIRE.

[Captioner] 23:41:24
THE REASON FOR THAT IS BECAUSE 

[Captioner] 23:41:27
FOR THE LAST -- MILLIONS OF 

[Captioner] 23:41:28
PALESTINIANS IN GAZA HAVE BEEN 

[Captioner] 23:41:30
FORCED TO LIVE IN AN OPEN AIR 

[Captioner] 23:41:30
PRISON.

[Captioner] 23:41:33
I ISRAELI OFFICIALS PROMISE TO 

[Captioner] 23:41:35
OPEN THE GATES OF HELL AND THE 

[Captioner] 23:41:36
MASSACRES IN GAZA HAVE ALREADY 

[Captioner] 23:41:36
BEEN COMMENCED.

[Captioner] 23:41:39
PALESTINIANS IN GAZA HAVE NO 

[Captioner] 23:41:40
SHELTER, NO REFUGE AND NOWHERE 

[Captioner] 23:41:41
TO ESCAPE.

[Captioner] 23:41:44
THE APARTHEID TO THEM IS THE -- 

[Captioner] 23:41:48
IS THE ONLY ONE TO BLAME, 

[Captioner] 23:41:51
ISRAELI VIOLENCE -- FOR 75 

[Captioner] 23:41:51
YEARS.

[Captioner] 23:41:56
FROM LAND SEIZURE TO ROUTINE AIR 

[Captioner] 23:41:59
STRIKE, MILITARY CHECKPOINTS AND 

[Captioner] 23:42:03
-- TO TARGETED KILLINGS, AND 

[Captioner] 23:42:08
TODAY PLIRN -- THE COMING DAYS 

[Captioner] 23:42:14
WILL BE -- WE CALL ON -- TO TAKE 

[Captioner] 23:42:18
THE -- TO STOP THIS ONGOING -- 

[Captioner] 23:42:18
PALESTINIAN.

[Captioner] 23:42:19
HOW MANY CHILDREN HAS TO DIE?

[Captioner] 23:42:20
CEASE FIRE NOW.

[Captioner] 23:42:25
>> Ms. Gauthier: THIS IS THE 

[Captioner] 23:42:27
LAST CALL FOR -- I'M GOING TO 

[Captioner] 23:42:30
SPELL THIS NAME -- HUDADH.

[Captioner] 23:42:36
THAT'S THE LAST SPEAKER CARD I 

[Captioner] 23:42:36
HAVE.

[Captioner] 23:42:41
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 23:42:42
AT THIS TIME I'LL CLOSE THE 

[Captioner] 23:42:43
PUBLIC HEARING.

[Captioner] 23:42:46
>> Ms. Gauthier: COUNCILMEMBER 

[Captioner] 23:42:49
KASSAN HAS HER HAND RAISED.

[Captioner] 23:42:50
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY.

[Captioner] 23:42:52
SO SHE'S -- WE'RE GOING TO TURN 

[Captioner] 23:42:54
IT BACK TO THE COUNCIL FOR 

[Captioner] 23:42:54
COMMENTS.

[Captioner] 23:43:01
I KNOW, THAT'S WHAT I WAS GOING 

[Captioner] 23:43:01
TO SAY.

[Captioner] 23:43:04
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, I GUESS 

[Captioner] 23:43:05
SHE HAS HER HAND RAISED, SO 

[Captioner] 23:43:05
FIRST.

[Captioner] 23:43:07
>> Councilmember Kassan: THANK 

[Captioner] 23:43:09
YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO 

[Captioner] 23:43:09
SPEAK.

[Captioner] 23:43:12
CAN YOU HEAR ME OKAY?

[Captioner] 23:43:14
>> Ms. Gauthier: IT WOULD BE 

[Captioner] 23:43:15
HELPFUL IF YOU SPOKE UP.

[Captioner] 23:43:15
>> Councilmember Kassan: OKAY.

[Captioner] 23:43:16
I'LL GET CLOSER.

[Captioner] 23:43:17
>> Ms. Gauthier: THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 23:43:18
>> Councilmember Kassan: THANK 

[Captioner] 23:43:18
YOU SO MUCH.

[Captioner] 23:43:23
THIS IS A VERY, VERY DIFFICULT 

[Captioner] 23:43:25
TOPIC, AND I KNOW IT'S RAISING 

[Captioner] 23:43:27
-- IT'S BRINGING UP SO MANY 

[Captioner] 23:43:29
STRONG EMOTIONS.

[Captioner] 23:43:31
I REALLY, REALLY LOVED WHAT ONE 

[Captioner] 23:43:35
OF THE SPEAKERS SAID WHEN SHE

[Captioner] 23:43:38
 SAID, DON'T BE AFRAID TO DEAL 

[Captioner] 23:43:39
WITH DIVISIVE ISSUES BECAUSE WE 

[Captioner] 23:43:41
DO DEAL WITH DIVISIVE ISSUES ALL 

[Captioner] 23:43:41
THE TIME.

[Captioner] 23:43:45
WE OFTEN DO HAVE TO VOTE ON 

[Captioner] 23:43:46
THINGS WHERE THERE ARE PEOPLE 

[Captioner] 23:43:48
WHO ARE NOT HAPPY WITH HOW WE VOTED.

[Captioner] 23:43:50
THERE ARE PEOPLE ON DIFFERENT 

[Captioner] 23:43:51
SIDES, AND WE HAVE TO CHOOSE A 

[Captioner] 23:43:51
SIDE.

[Captioner] 23:43:54
SO I DON'T THINK IT'S RIGHT TO 

[Captioner] 23:43:56
SAY WE DON'T WANT TO VOTE ON 

[Captioner] 23:43:57
SOMETHING THAT -- WE DON'T WANT 

[Captioner] 23:44:00
TO MAKE A STATEMENT THAT IS DIVISIVE.

[Captioner] 23:44:02
IN SOME CASES, IT'S NECESSARY 

[Captioner] 23:44:03
THAT WE DO MAKE STATEMENTS THAT 

[Captioner] 23:44:04
ARE DIVISIVE.

[Captioner] 23:44:08
I ALSO WANT TO MENTION, ONE OF 

[Captioner] 23:44:10
THE SPEAKERS SAID WE'RE DIVIDED 

[Captioner] 23:44:11
BETWEEN MUSLIMS AND JEWS, AND I 

[Captioner] 23:44:13
JUST WANT TO SAY, LET'S BE 

[Captioner] 23:44:15
REALLY CAREFUL ABOUT SAYING 

[Captioner] 23:44:16
THINGS LIKE THAT, BECAUSE THERE 

[Captioner] 23:44:20
IS NO GROUP THAT IS MONOLITHIC.

[Captioner] 23:44:23
EVERY GROUP HAS SO MUCH 

[Captioner] 23:44:25
DIVERSITY, AND I DON'T WANT US 

[Captioner] 23:44:27
TO BE THINKING THAT THERE IS A 

[Captioner] 23:44:28
DIVISION BETWEEN MUSLIMS AND 

[Captioner] 23:44:29
JEWS IN FREMONT.

[Captioner] 23:44:31
THERE IS A DIVISION BETWEEN SOME 

[Captioner] 23:44:33
OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE SPEAKING 

[Captioner] 23:44:35
TONIGHT AND WHO HAVE SENT US 

[Captioner] 23:44:36
EMAILS, BUT LET'S NOT MAKE IT 

[Captioner] 23:44:37
BIGGER THAN THAT.

[Captioner] 23:44:42
I MYSELF AM A JEW, AND LIKE SO 

[Captioner] 23:44:46
MANY JEWS IN THE UNITED STATES, 

[Captioner] 23:44:47
INCLUDING SENATOR SCHUMER AND 

[Captioner] 23:44:50
ALSO OUR VERY OWN CONGRESS 

[Captioner] 23:44:52
MEMBER RO KHANNA, I OPPOSE THE 

[Captioner] 23:44:54
CURRENT ISRAELI GOVERNMENT 

[Captioner] 23:44:54
ACTIONS.

[Captioner] 23:44:59
YOU CAN BE PRO ISRAEL AND AT THE 

[Captioner] 23:45:01
SAME TIME, LIKE SENATOR SCHUMER, 

[Captioner] 23:45:03
BELIEVE THAT THE CURRENT ISRAELI 

[Captioner] 23:45:06
GOVERNMENT IS ACTING IN HORRIBLE 

[Captioner] 23:45:08
WAYS THAT WE CANNOT SUPPORT.

[Captioner] 23:45:12
AND YET OUR TAXPAYER MONEY IS 

[Captioner] 23:45:14
BEING USED TO SUPPORT THE 

[Captioner] 23:45:17
ACTIONS OF THE ISRAELI 

[Captioner] 23:45:18
GOVERNMENT, WHICH JUST GO WAY 

[Captioner] 23:45:21
BEYOND WHAT IS REASONABLE FOR 

[Captioner] 23:45:23
ADDRESSING THE ATTACKS BY 

[Captioner] 23:45:23
HAMAS.

[Captioner] 23:45:26
AND LET'S NOT FORGET THAT HAMAS 

[Captioner] 23:45:28
DOES NOT RECEIVE U.S. TAX 

[Captioner] 23:45:28
DOLLARS.

[Captioner] 23:45:30
IT IS ISRAEL, THE ISRAELI 

[Captioner] 23:45:32
GOVERNMENT THAT RECEIVES U.S. 

[Captioner] 23:45:34
TAX DOLLARS WHICH ARE USED TO 

[Captioner] 23:45:36
PURCHASE BOMBS WHICH ARE USED TO 

[Captioner] 23:45:36
KILL INNOCENT PEOPLE.

[Captioner] 23:45:40
AND I KNOW SOME PEOPLE SAY WE 

[Captioner] 23:45:42
SHOULDN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT AN 

[Captioner] 23:45:44
INTERNATIONAL ISSUE, BUT THERE 

[Captioner] 23:45:46
IS A GOOD ARGUMENT TO BE MADE 

[Captioner] 23:45:48
THAT BECAUSE WE ARE LOCAL 

[Captioner] 23:45:51
ELECTED OFFICIALS, WE CAN USE 

[Captioner] 23:45:54
OUR VOICE TO ADD TO THE CALLS 

[Captioner] 23:45:56
FOR A CEASE FIRE AND TO MAKE IT 

[Captioner] 23:45:58
CLEAR TO OUR FEDERAL ELECTED 

[Captioner] 23:46:00
OFFICIALS THAT THIS IS SOMETHING 

[Captioner] 23:46:02
WE FEEL STRONGLY ABOUT AND WE'RE 

[Captioner] 23:46:07
SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF

[Captioner] 23:46:08
 MANY, MANY PEOPLE IN OUR 

[Captioner] 23:46:09
COMMUNITY AND WE CANNOT TOLERATE 

[Captioner] 23:46:11
THE USE OF OUR TAX DOLLARS TO 

[Captioner] 23:46:13
FUND COLLECTIVE PUNISHMENT AND 

[Captioner] 23:46:13
STARVATION.

[Captioner] 23:46:16
SO I FEEL THAT IF WE DO CHOOSE 

[Captioner] 23:46:18
TO ADOPT A RESOLUTION, IT MUST 

[Captioner] 23:46:21
CALL FOR AN IMMEDIATE CEASE 

[Captioner] 23:46:22
FIRE, IT MUST CALL FOR THE 

[Captioner] 23:46:24
RETURN OF ALL HOSTAGES AND IT 

[Captioner] 23:46:26
MUST CALL FOR ALLOWING 

[Captioner] 23:46:28
HUMANITARIAN AID INTO GAZA 

[Captioner] 23:46:28
IMMEDIATELY.

[Captioner] 23:46:31
AND SOME PEOPLE SAY THAT, OH, IF 

[Captioner] 23:46:33
WE ADOPT THIS TONIGHT, THIS WILL 

[Captioner] 23:46:35
BE THE FINAL STATEMENT ON THE 

[Captioner] 23:46:35
MATTER.

[Captioner] 23:46:37
BUT IT WON'T BE, BECAUSE MANY 

[Captioner] 23:46:38
PEOPLE WILL PROBABLY CONTINUE TO 

[Captioner] 23:46:40
COME AND SPEAK AT COUNCIL 

[Captioner] 23:46:42
MEETINGS BECAUSE THIS RESOLUTION 

[Captioner] 23:46:44
DOES NOT ADDRESS WHAT SO MANY 

[Captioner] 23:46:45
PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITY HAVE 

[Captioner] 23:46:46
BEEN CALLING ON US TO DO.

[Captioner] 23:46:49
SO I CANNOT SUPPORT THE 

[Captioner] 23:46:51
RESOLUTION IN ITS CURRENT FORM 

[Captioner] 23:46:53
UNLESS IT AMENDED TO INCLUDE 

[Captioner] 23:46:55
THOSE THREE ITEMS WHICH WERE 

[Captioner] 23:46:56
REQUESTED BY SEVERAL OF THE 

[Captioner] 23:46:57
SPEAKERS.

[Captioner] 23:46:57
THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 23:47:01
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 23:47:04
NEXT SPEAKER IS COUNCILMEMBER 

[Captioner] 23:47:04
COX.

[Captioner] 23:47:06
>> Councilmember Cox: THANK 

[Captioner] 23:47:06
YOU.

[Captioner] 23:47:08
I WANT TO THANK EVERYONE FOR ALL 

[Captioner] 23:47:10
OF THEIR COMMENTS, ALL OF THEIR 

[Captioner] 23:47:14
EMAILS, PHONE CALLS, ALL OF THE 

[Captioner] 23:47:14
COMMUNICATIONS.

[Captioner] 23:47:16
AT THIS TIME, I'M GOING TO HAVE 

[Captioner] 23:47:20
TO WITHDRAW MY SECOND PART OF 

[Captioner] 23:47:23
THE MOTION DUE TO SOME OTHER 

[Captioner] 23:47:23
OUTSIDE INTERNATIONAL 

[Captioner] 23:47:25
APPOINTMENTS THAT I DO HOLD, AND 

[Captioner] 23:47:28
THAT I WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO 

[Captioner] 23:47:30
PARTAKE IN MAKING ANY DECISIONS 

[Captioner] 23:47:31
BECAUSE IT'S NOT ONLY JUST A 

[Captioner] 23:47:33
LOCAL LEVEL, BUT I HAVE 

[Captioner] 23:47:34
INTERNATIONAL OTHER APPOINTMENTS 

[Captioner] 23:47:35
AS WELL.

[Captioner] 23:47:38
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 23:47:43
NEXT SPEAKERS FROM THE COUNCIL?

[Captioner] 23:47:46
COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL.

[Captioner] 23:47:49
>> Councilmember Campbell: WELL, 

[Captioner] 23:47:52
THANK YOU, COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, 

[Captioner] 23:47:57
FOR YOUR COMMENTS AND

[Captioner] 23:47:57
 YOUR POSITION ON THIS 

[Captioner] 23:47:58
PARTICULAR ISSUE.

[Captioner] 23:48:00
I DON'T WANT US TO LOSE SIGHT OF 

[Captioner] 23:48:05
THE FACT THAT WE RECOGNIZE AND

[Captioner] 23:48:07
 WE ARE SENSITIVE TO 

[Captioner] 23:48:10
INTERNATIONAL ISSUES AND HOW 

[Captioner] 23:48:11
THOSE INTERNATIONAL ISSUES HAVE 

[Captioner] 23:48:13
A TRICKLE DOWN EFFECT.

[Captioner] 23:48:17
WE'RE NOT -- I'M NOT SAYING THAT 

[Captioner] 23:48:22
I DON'T RECOGNIZE THAT THIS IS

[Captioner] 23:48:26
 A SITUATION THAT IS NOT

[Captioner] 23:48:28
 IMPACTING FREMONT.

[Captioner] 23:48:32
AND THAT WAS THE REASON WHY

[Captioner] 23:48:35
 I WROTE WITH THE SUPPORT OF 

[Captioner] 23:48:38
STAFF, WE CAME UP WITH THIS 

[Captioner] 23:48:39
STATEMENT BECAUSE WE WANTED TO 

[Captioner] 23:48:43
BE BROADER AND MORE INCLUSIVE OF 

[Captioner] 23:48:47
WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE IN 

[Captioner] 23:48:47
FREMONT.

[Captioner] 23:48:48
I DEFINITELY DON'T WANT WAR.

[Captioner] 23:48:52
I DON'T WANT STARVING KIDS, I 

[Captioner] 23:48:52
DON'T WANT ANY OF THAT.

[Captioner] 23:48:57
BUT AS A LEADER IN FREMONT, AND 

[Captioner] 23:48:59
MANY OF YOU HAVE ALREADY SAID 

[Captioner] 23:49:01
THIS, WE ELECTED YOU TO DEAL 

[Captioner] 23:49:02
WITH FREMONT LOCAL ISSUES.

[Captioner] 23:49:07
AND SO THIS WAS AN ATTEMPT TO 

[Captioner] 23:49:10
DEAL SPECIFICALLY WITH FREMONT 

[Captioner] 23:49:10
LOCAL ISSUES.

[Captioner] 23:49:17
AND SO WHILE I AM SEEING THAT I

[Captioner] 23:49:19
 HAVE TWO COUNCILPERSONS WHO 

[Captioner] 23:49:22
WOULD NOT BE WILLING TO SUPPORT 

[Captioner] 23:49:25
THIS IN ITS CURRENT FORM, THERE 

[Captioner] 23:49:27
IS A MOTION ON THE FLOOR, AND 

[Captioner] 23:49:31
THERE IS A SECOND, AND SO -- OH, 

[Captioner] 23:49:31
YOU WITHDRAW IT.

[Captioner] 23:49:32
OKAY.

[Captioner] 23:49:35
SO IS THERE -- I'M SORRY.

[Captioner] 23:49:38
I'LL TURN IT BACK OVER TO THE 

[Captioner] 23:49:38
MAYOR TO --

[Captioner] 23:49:39
>> Mayor Mei: I THINK THE MAKER 

[Captioner] 23:49:41
OF THE MOTION, WHO WAS THE 

[Captioner] 23:49:41
MAKER?

[Captioner] 23:49:44
WAS IT COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN OR 

[Captioner] 23:49:44
COUNCILMEMBER --

[Captioner] 23:49:45
>> Councilmember Campbell: NO, 

[Captioner] 23:49:45
IT WAS ME.

[Captioner] 23:49:46
>> Mayor Mei: SO YOU WERE THE 

[Captioner] 23:49:47
MAKER.

[Captioner] 23:49:47
IS THERE A SECOND?

[Captioner] 23:49:52
IF THERE'S NO SECOND, THEN THE 

[Captioner] 23:49:55
MOTION DIES, BUT -- 

[Captioner] 23:49:57
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN?

[Captioner] 23:50:04
>> Councilmember Salwan:

[Captioner] 23:50:07
 YES, I WOULD LIKE TO SECOND 

[Captioner] 23:50:07
THIS.

[Captioner] 23:50:10
YOU KNOW, WE TRULY REPRESENT A 

[Captioner] 23:50:14
VERY DIVERSE EXEUNT, AND A VERY 

[Captioner] 23:50:15
COMPASSIONATE COMMUNITY.

[Captioner] 23:50:18
AND THIS HAS BEEN VERY STRESSFUL 

[Captioner] 23:50:22
FOR EVERYONE INVOLVED, AND YOU 

[Captioner] 23:50:24
KNOW, THE LIVES LOST AND THE 

[Captioner] 23:50:27
GREAT CRISIS THAT WE HAVE IN THE 

[Captioner] 23:50:28
MIDDLE EAST.

[Captioner] 23:50:32
AND I WOULD LIKE TO SEE OUR 

[Captioner] 23:50:34
COMMUNITY IN FREMONT COME 

[Captioner] 23:50:37
TOGETHER AND BE UNITED, AND MAKE 

[Captioner] 23:50:41
SURE THAT WE RESPECT EACH OTHER, 

[Captioner] 23:50:42
MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T HAVE ANY 

[Captioner] 23:50:46
KIND OF HATE, WHETHER IT'S 

[Captioner] 23:50:49
ANTISEMITISM OR ANTIPALESTINIAN 

[Captioner] 23:50:51
OR ANTIARAB OR ISLAM PHOBIA OR 

[Captioner] 23:50:52
ANY KIND OF PHOBIA.

[Captioner] 23:50:58
AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO LET OUR 

[Captioner] 23:51:00
VALUES BE KNOWN THAT WE ARE A 

[Captioner] 23:51:01
UNITED COMMUNITY AND WE WANT TO 

[Captioner] 23:51:04
MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY CAN 

[Captioner] 23:51:07
CO-EXIST HERE PEACEFULLY, AND 

[Captioner] 23:51:11
YOU KNOW, A LOT OF OUR ISSUES 

[Captioner] 23:51:14
ARE RELATED TO ISSUES IN 

[Captioner] 23:51:16
FREMONT, AND WE CAN'T CONTROL 

[Captioner] 23:51:18
WHAT HAPPENS OUTSIDE OUR CITY 

[Captioner] 23:51:20
BUT WE CAN DEFINITELY MAKE SURE 

[Captioner] 23:51:23
THAT FREMONT CONTINUES TO BE THE 

[Captioner] 23:51:23
HAPPIEST CITY.

[Captioner] 23:51:26
AS INDIVIDUALS, WE CAN 

[Captioner] 23:51:27
DEFINITELY WEIGH IN.

[Captioner] 23:51:30
I'VE SPOKEN TO MY CONGRESSMAN, 

[Captioner] 23:51:32
RO KHANNA, AND LET HIM KNOW HOW 

[Captioner] 23:51:34
I FEEL, BUT AT THE CITY LEVEL, I 

[Captioner] 23:51:36
THINK WE NEED TO BRING OUR 

[Captioner] 23:51:38
COMMUNITY TOGETHER AND MOVE THIS 

[Captioner] 23:51:38
FORWARD.

[Captioner] 23:51:40
SO AGAIN I'D LIKE TO GO AHEAD 

[Captioner] 23:51:43
AND SECOND THIS, AND READY FOR 

[Captioner] 23:51:43
THE VOTE.

[Captioner] 23:51:46
>> Mayor Mei: COUNCILMEMBER 

[Captioner] 23:51:49
KENG, I SEE THAT YOU'D LIKE TO 

[Captioner] 23:51:49
SPEAK.

[Captioner] 23:51:51
>> Councilmember Keng: I WILL 

[Captioner] 23:51:52
MAKE A QUICK COMMENT.

[Captioner] 23:51:54
I APPRECIATE EVERYONE COMING.

[Captioner] 23:51:58
I KNOW THAT

[Captioner] 23:52:01
 THERE IS A VERY LONG AND 

[Captioner] 23:52:03
COMPLICATED HISTORY BETWEEN THE 

[Captioner] 23:52:06
COUNTRIES IN CONFLICT RIGHT NOW, 

[Captioner] 23:52:10
AND I WILL NOT TRY TO SAY THAT I 

[Captioner] 23:52:13
UNDERSTAND ALL OF THE HISTORY, 

[Captioner] 23:52:15
WHICH IS WHY I THINK IT'S 

[Captioner] 23:52:19
IMPORTANT THAT WE STAY NEUTRAL 

[Captioner] 23:52:21
IN THIS WHOLE SITUATION, EVEN 

[Captioner] 23:52:23
THOUGH WE ALL DON'T WANT TO SEE 

[Captioner] 23:52:25
ALL THE LIVES BEING LOST, ALL 

[Captioner] 23:52:26
THE CHILDREN, ALL THE INNOCENT 

[Captioner] 23:52:29
LIVES AND CIVILIANS BEING LOST 

[Captioner] 23:52:29
RIGHT NOW.

[Captioner] 23:52:34
MY HUSBAND IS A -- WILL SERVE IN

[Captioner] 23:52:36
 THE U.S. MARINE AND HE HAS SEEN 

[Captioner] 23:52:39
WAR AND HE CAME BACK AND SAID 

[Captioner] 23:52:42
THAT YOU DO NOT WANT TO BE IN 

[Captioner] 23:52:42
THAT SITUATION.

[Captioner] 23:52:45
HE WAS LUCKY TO COME BACK 

[Captioner] 23:52:45
ALIVE.

[Captioner] 23:52:49
BUT -- AND IN THIS COMMUNITY, WE 

[Captioner] 23:52:50
HAVE PEOPLE FROM ALL OVER THE 

[Captioner] 23:52:50
WORLD.

[Captioner] 23:52:53
WE HAVE DIFFERENT RELIGIONS, 

[Captioner] 23:52:57
DIFFERENT CULTURES, AND I 

[Captioner] 23:52:58
APPRECIATE COUNCILMEMBER 

[Captioner] 23:53:02
CAMPBELL BRINGING THIS STATEMENT 

[Captioner] 23:53:05
FORWARD CALLING FOR PEACE, 

[Captioner] 23:53:08
BECAUSE WHICHEVER LANGUAGE WE 

[Captioner] 23:53:09
TAKE, WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO 

[Captioner] 23:53:11
PLEASE EVERYBODY, BUT WE WANT TO 

[Captioner] 23:53:13
-- WE STILL WANT TO TAKE A STAND 

[Captioner] 23:53:18
IN SAYING THAT WE WANT OUR 

[Captioner] 23:53:21
COMMUNITY TO BE ABLE TO COEXIST 

[Captioner] 23:53:25
AND BE THERE FOR EACH

[Captioner] 23:53:27
 OTHER AS IN THE COMPASSIONATE 

[Captioner] 23:53:30
CITY, THAT WE CAN BE INCLUSIVE 

[Captioner] 23:53:34
OF EVERYONE AND NOT HAVE ANY OF 

[Captioner] 23:53:38
THE HATE BEHAVIORS THAT EVEN 

[Captioner] 23:53:39
SOME OF OUR CHILDREN ARE 

[Captioner] 23:53:40
EXPERIENCING AT SCHOOL.

[Captioner] 23:53:43
WHICH IS VERY HEARTBREAKING TO HEAR.

[Captioner] 23:53:45
SO I WOULD BE SUPPORTIVE OF THIS 

[Captioner] 23:53:45
STATEMENT.

[Captioner] 23:53:45
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

[Captioner] 23:53:50
>> Mayor Mei: SURE.

[Captioner] 23:53:52
SO ONE OF THE THINGS I WANTED TO 

[Captioner] 23:53:53
SAY, I'LL ADD IN A LITTLE BIT 

[Captioner] 23:53:54
BUT I'M GOING TO ASK 

[Captioner] 23:53:55
COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL TO 

[Captioner] 23:53:56
RESTATE HER MOTION TOO.

[Captioner] 23:53:58
BUT AT THIS POINT, I WANTED TO 

[Captioner] 23:54:01
SAY SHALOM AND THE WHOLE IDEA 

[Captioner] 23:54:02
THAT WHAT WE'RE FOCUSING ON IS 

[Captioner] 23:54:02
PEACE.

[Captioner] 23:54:05
I REJECT THE DISCUSSION ABOUT 

[Captioner] 23:54:07
THE TAX DOLLARS BECAUSE WE -- IF 

[Captioner] 23:54:08
YOU LOOK AT OUR BUDGETING 

[Captioner] 23:54:11
MEETINGS WHICH ARE COMING UP, DO 

[Captioner] 23:54:12
NOT ALLOCATE ANY FUNDING 

[Captioner] 23:54:15
DIRECTLY TO ANY SORT OF THESE 

[Captioner] 23:54:15
ACTIONS.

[Captioner] 23:54:18
AND I ALSO WOULD ECHO THAT I'VE 

[Captioner] 23:54:21
SPOKEN WITH MY LEGISLATORS AND 

[Captioner] 23:54:23
MY CONGRESS MEMBERS, AND I'VE 

[Captioner] 23:54:24
EXPRESSED MY CONCERNS IN MAKING 

[Captioner] 23:54:26
SURE THAT WE DO DELIVER AID AND 

[Captioner] 23:54:30
SUPPORT FOR ALL WHO ARE 

[Captioner] 23:54:32
SUFFERING AND ALL WHO ARE HELD 

[Captioner] 23:54:33
HOSTAGES AND ALL WHO ARE 

[Captioner] 23:54:34
VICTIMS, SO THERE IS NO FEELING 

[Captioner] 23:54:36
OR WANTING FROM ANY OF US ON THE 

[Captioner] 23:54:38
COUNCIL RIGHT NOW TO SEE ANY 

[Captioner] 23:54:40
CHILD OR ANY PEOPLE HURTING OR 

[Captioner] 23:54:40
SUFFERING.

[Captioner] 23:54:42
WHAT WE ARE SAYING IS THAT WE 

[Captioner] 23:54:43
ARE STANDING FOR PEACE.

[Captioner] 23:54:45
AND I WOULD LIKE OUR 

[Captioner] 23:54:47
COUNCILMEMBER TO RESTATE THE 

[Captioner] 23:54:50
STATEMENT BECAUSE I DO THINK 

[Captioner] 23:54:52
PERSONALLY THAT WE ARE UNITED IN 

[Captioner] 23:54:53
WANTING TO HAVE THOSE BASIC 

[Captioner] 23:54:55
IDEAS AND HOW WE BRING THE PEACE 

[Captioner] 23:54:56
AND THAT'S WHY IF YOU'VE EVER 

[Captioner] 23:54:58
BEEN TO OUR SCHOOL BOARD 

[Captioner] 23:54:59
MEETINGS EVER IN THE PAST, IF 

[Captioner] 23:55:00
YOU LOOK ON THE WALL WHEN YOU'RE 

[Captioner] 23:55:02
IN THERE, THE REASON WHY IT HAS 

[Captioner] 23:55:03
THE PICTURES OF THE CHILDREN 

[Captioner] 23:55:05
THAT ARE THERE TODAY IS THAT WE 

[Captioner] 23:55:07
DON'T ALWAYS AGREE ON WHAT WE 

[Captioner] 23:55:07
VOTE ON.

[Captioner] 23:55:10
BUT BECAUSE ON THAT FOCUS WHEN 

[Captioner] 23:55:12
WE'RE THERE, WE WANTED TO SEE 

[Captioner] 23:55:13
THE PICTURES OF THE CHILDREN 

[Captioner] 23:55:15
THAT WE WERE SERVING, THE ONES 

[Captioner] 23:55:17
THAT WE ARE HERE TO SUPPORT AND 

[Captioner] 23:55:18
THE ONES THAT WE'RE HERE TO 

[Captioner] 23:55:18
DELIVER.

[Captioner] 23:55:20
AND I KNOW THAT FROM ALL OF US 

[Captioner] 23:55:24
ON THE COUNCIL, WE HAVE BEEN 

[Captioner] 23:55:26
WITH SOLIDARITY FOR DIFFERENT 

[Captioner] 23:55:29
OCCASIONS WHERE WE HAVE 

[Captioner] 23:55:30
INTERFAITH GATHERINGS, WHERE WE 

[Captioner] 23:55:32
HAVE COME AND CELEBRATE AND SAT 

[Captioner] 23:55:34
ALONGSIDE ALL OF YOU AS BROTHERS 

[Captioner] 23:55:36
AND SISTERS, AND THAT'S WHAT WE 

[Captioner] 23:55:36
STAND FOR.

[Captioner] 23:55:37
AND SO I'D LIKE MY COUNCIL MEMO 

[Captioner] 23:55:42
 COUNCILMEMBER TO RESTATE

[Captioner] 23:55:43
 THAT AND TO CLARIFY AGAIN WHAT 

[Captioner] 23:55:45
OUR MOTION IS AND HOW IT IS TO 

[Captioner] 23:55:47
UNIFY US AND THE BIGGEST PART OF 

[Captioner] 23:55:48
COMMUNITY IS UNITY, AND FOR ME, 

[Captioner] 23:55:49
THIS IS MY FINAL STATEMENT.

[Captioner] 23:55:51
AND SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I 

[Captioner] 23:55:53
STRONGLY BELIEVE IN, THAT WE 

[Captioner] 23:55:55
BELIEVE IN PEACE, THAT BELIEVE 

[Captioner] 23:55:56
IN UNITY, AND THAT I REJECT THE 

[Captioner] 23:55:58
IDEA OF TRYING TO DIVIDE OUR 

[Captioner] 23:55:58
COMMUNITY.

[Captioner] 23:56:01
COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL.

[Captioner] 23:56:03
>> Councilmember Campbell: OKAY, 

[Captioner] 23:56:05
MAYOR MEI, CAN YOU ASK ME THAT 

[Captioner] 23:56:06
QUESTION AGAIN, PLEASE?

[Captioner] 23:56:07
>> Mayor Mei: YES.

[Captioner] 23:56:08
COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL.

[Captioner] 23:56:11
COULD YOU PLEASE CLARIFY YOUR 

[Captioner] 23:56:12
REFERRAL AND THE FINAL STATEMENT 

[Captioner] 23:56:14
THAT YOU HAD MODIFIED SO WE CAN 

[Captioner] 23:56:15
MAKE SURE THE MOTION IS CLEAR?

[Captioner] 23:56:16
>> Councilmember Campbell: YOU 

[Captioner] 23:56:17
WANT ME TO READ THE STATEMENT 

[Captioner] 23:56:17
AGAIN?

[Captioner] 23:56:18
>> Mayor Mei: YES AND THE MOTION 

[Captioner] 23:56:19
YOU HAD.

[Captioner] 23:56:20
I THINK YOU ALSO HAD A SECOND 

[Captioner] 23:56:21
PART OF THE MOTION TO HAVE A 

[Captioner] 23:56:24
REFERRAL FOR THE POLICY ON 

[Captioner] 23:56:24
INTERNATIONAL --

[Captioner] 23:56:24
>> Cty. Attny. Alvarado: THROUGH 

[Captioner] 23:56:26
THE CHAIR, JUST IN THE INTEREST 

[Captioner] 23:56:28
OF ENSURING THAT ANY ACTION GOES 

[Captioner] 23:56:32
INTO THE RECORD, BEING THAT IT'S 

[Captioner] 23:56:34
11:56, IT MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA 

[Captioner] 23:56:36
TO ADOPT THE MOTION TO GO PAST 

[Captioner] 23:56:37
MIDNIGHT IN CASE EVEN BY A FEW 

[Captioner] 23:56:38
MINUTES THAT OCCURS.

[Captioner] 23:56:39
>> Mayor Mei: OKAY.

[Captioner] 23:56:41
I'D LIKE TO ASK FOR A MOTION TO 

[Captioner] 23:56:44
GO PAST MIDNIGHT.

[Captioner] 23:56:46
MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN,

MAYOR MEI, I'M GOING TO READ THE 

[Captioner] 23:57:17
STATEMENT IN ITS ENTIRETY 

[Captioner] 23:57:19
BECAUSE I DID ADD A COUPLE OF 

[Captioner] 23:57:20
THINGS AND I JUST WANT TO MAKE 

[Captioner] 23:57:21
SURE THAT IT'S CLEAR.

[Captioner] 23:57:26
AS LEADERS OF THE DIVERSE AND 

[Captioner] 23:57:27
COMPASSIONATE COMMUNITY OF 

[Captioner] 23:57:29
FREMONT, WE ARE DEEPLY SADDENED 

[Captioner] 23:57:32
AND CONCERNED ABOUT THE 

[Captioner] 23:57:34
ESCALATING CONFLICT IN GAZA AND 

[Captioner] 23:57:34
ISRAEL.

[Captioner] 23:57:36
OUR HEARTS GO OUT TO ALL THOSE 

[Captioner] 23:57:40
AFFECTED BY THE VIOLENCE, 

[Captioner] 23:57:41
INCLUDING INNOCENT CIVILIANS WHO 

[Captioner] 23:57:42
ARE CAUGHT IN THE CROSSFIRE.

[Captioner] 23:57:46
THE FREMONT CITY COUNCIL IS 

[Captioner] 23:57:49
UNITED IN OUR CALL FOR SUSTAINED 

[Captioner] 23:57:53
PEACE IN THE PALESTINE AND 

[Captioner] 23:57:53
ISRAELI REGIONS.

[Captioner] 23:57:55
WHILE THE CITY REMAINS FOCUSED 

[Captioner] 23:57:58
ON LOCAL POLICY MATTERS, WE CAN 

[Captioner] 23:58:02
NO LONGER STAND SILENT WHILE 

[Captioner] 23:58:02
TRAGIC EVENTS CONTINUE TO CLAIM 

[Captioner] 23:58:06
THE LIVES OF INNOCENT PEOPLE IN 

[Captioner] 23:58:08
ISRAEL, GAZA, AND THE WEST 

[Captioner] 23:58:08
BANK.

[Captioner] 23:58:10
WE HAVE A HUMANITARIAN 

[Captioner] 23:58:12
OBLIGATION AS PEOPLE TO SPEAK 

[Captioner] 23:58:14
OUT AGAINST ACTIONS THAT 

[Captioner] 23:58:16
ENDANGER THOSE WHO ARE INNOCENT, 

[Captioner] 23:58:18
AND ABOVE ALL, WE MUST CALL FOR 

[Captioner] 23:58:22
THE SAFETY OF CHILDREN BY 

[Captioner] 23:58:23
ENSURING ADEQUATE SUPPLIES OF 

[Captioner] 23:58:25
FOOD AND WATER.

[Captioner] 23:58:27
OVER THE LAST SEVERAL WEEKS, 

[Captioner] 23:58:28
MANY OF OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS 

[Captioner] 23:58:31
HAVE SHARED PERSONAL STORIES OF 

[Captioner] 23:58:34
TRAUMA, SUFFERING, AND DEATH 

[Captioner] 23:58:35
ENDURED BY LOVED ONES DUE TO THE 

[Captioner] 23:58:35
WAR.

[Captioner] 23:58:38
WE MOURN WITH THEM, AND WE PLEA 

[Captioner] 23:58:40
TO END THE VIOLENCE THAT 

[Captioner] 23:58:41
CONTINUES TO ENDANGER INNOCENT 

[Captioner] 23:58:41
LIVES.

[Captioner] 23:58:46
FREMONT STANDS FOR PEACE, 

[Captioner] 23:58:47
JUSTICE, AND HUMAN RIGHTS FOR 

[Captioner] 23:58:49
ALL, REGARDLESS OF THEIR 

[Captioner] 23:58:50
NATIONALITY OR BACKGROUND.

[Captioner] 23:58:54
WE STRONGLY CONDEMN ANY ACTIONS 

[Captioner] 23:58:57
THAT RESULT IN HARM TO CIVILIANS 

[Captioner] 23:59:01
AND UNDERMINE THE PROSPECTS FOR 

[Captioner] 23:59:02
PEACEFUL RESOLUTION TO THIS 

[Captioner] 23:59:02
CONFLICT.

[Captioner] 23:59:07
LOCALLY, WE ARE OBSERVING A 

[Captioner] 23:59:11
DISTURBING INCREASE IN ISLAMIC 

[Captioner] 23:59:14
PHOBIA, ANTISEMITISM, ANTIARAB, 

[Captioner] 23:59:17
ANTIJEWISH HATE, WHICH LEAVE 

[Captioner] 23:59:18
MANY FEELING ISOLATED.

[Captioner] 23:59:21
AS ONE OF THE SAFEST CITIES IN 

[Captioner] 23:59:21
AMERICA, THE CITY COUNCIL WANTS 

[Captioner] 23:59:24
TO ENSURE THAT FREMONT IS A SAFE 

[Captioner] 23:59:27
AND WELCOMING, WHERE DIVERSITY 

[Captioner] 23:59:29
IS CELEBRATED AND PEACE IS AT 

[Captioner] 23:59:30
ITS CORE.

[Captioner] 23:59:35
WE CARE DEEPLY ABOUT OUR ENTIRE 

[Captioner] 23:59:38
COMMUNITY, AND OUR HIGHEST 

[Captioner] 23:59:41
PRIORITY IS THAT FREMONT REMAINS 

[Captioner] 23:59:42
A COMPASSIONATE CITY FOR ALL.

[Captioner] 23:59:46
IT IS AN INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT 

[Captioner] 23:59:49
TIME IN OUR HISTORY, AND WE MUST 

[Captioner] 23:59:52
STAND TOGETHER, HAND IN HAND, 

[Captioner] 23:59:53
COMMITTED AND UNITED AGAINST 

[Captioner] 23:59:53
HATE.

[Captioner] 23:59:57
WE URGE PARTIES INVOLVED TO 

[Captioner] 00:00:01
ENGAGE IN MEANINGFUL DIALOGUE TO 

[Captioner] 00:00:03
HALT THE HOSTILITIES AND ADDRESS 

[Captioner] 00:00:05
THE ROOT CAUSES OF THE CONFLICT.

[Captioner] 00:00:08
ONLY THROUGH DIALOGUE AND 

[Captioner] 00:00:10
DIPLOMACY CAN A LASTING AND JUST 

[Captioner] 00:00:12
SOLUTION BE ACHIEVED.

[Captioner] 00:00:17
WE CALL ON OUR COMMUNITY TO COME 

[Captioner] 00:00:20
TOGETHER IN SOLIDARITY, AND 

[Captioner] 00:00:22
EMPATHY TO SUPPORT INITIATIVES 

[Captioner] 00:00:27
THAT PROMOTE PEACE IN THE 

[Captioner] 00:00:27
PALESTINIAN REGION.

[Captioner] 00:00:30
FOSTER RECONCILIATION, AND WORK 

[Captioner] 00:00:31
TOWARD MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING.

[Captioner] 00:00:35
TOGETHER, WE CAN UNITE TO BUILD 

[Captioner] 00:00:36
A BETTER FUTURE FOR ALL.

[Captioner] 00:00:42
I ALSO WANT TO PAUSE BEFORE I 

[Captioner] 00:00:49
READ AGAIN MY RECOMMENDATION FOR

[Captioner] 00:00:51
 THE MOTION THAT'S BEEN FIRST 

[Captioner] 00:00:54
AND SECONDED, BECAUSE SOMEBODY 

[Captioner] 00:00:55
SAID SOMETHING EARLIER THAT MADE 

[Captioner] 00:00:59
ME FEEL LIKE, YOU KNOW, I'M THIS 

[Captioner] 00:01:00
HEARTLESS, CARELESS INDIVIDUAL 

[Captioner] 00:01:01
WHO DOESN'T CARE ABOUT PEOPLE.

[Captioner] 00:01:04
I UNDERSTAND BLACK LIVES 

[Captioner] 00:01:04
MATTER.

[Captioner] 00:01:07
ALL LIVES MATTER, AND IT DOESN'T 

[Captioner] 00:01:10
-- YOU KNOW, I'M NOT -- I'M NOT 

[Captioner] 00:01:11
-- YOU DIDN'T ELECT ME TO TAKE SIDES.

[Captioner] 00:01:15
YOU ELECTED ME TO MAKE HARD, 

[Captioner] 00:01:17
TOUGH DECISIONS, AND SOMETIMES 

[Captioner] 00:01:19
IT IS, AND EVERYBODY CAN'T BE 

[Captioner] 00:01:19
PLEASED.

[Captioner] 00:01:21
BUT WHAT I AM DOING, AND WHAT I 

[Captioner] 00:01:23
HOPE TO BE, AND WHAT I HOPE YOU 

[Captioner] 00:01:26
SEE ME AS IS A LEADER IN THIS 

[Captioner] 00:01:27
COMMUNITY THAT IS TRYING TO 

[Captioner] 00:01:28
BRING THE COMMUNITY TOGETHER.

[Captioner] 00:01:30
WE MAY NOT AGREE, WE DON'T HAVE 

[Captioner] 00:01:31
TO AGROW.

[Captioner] 00:01:35
 AGREE, BUT

[Captioner] 00:01:37
 WE CAN AGREE IF ANYBODY 

[Captioner] 00:01:39
UNDERSTANDS WHAT IT WOULD MEAN 

[Captioner] 00:01:40
TO BE GENOCIDE IT WOULD BE ME.

[Captioner] 00:01:43
RIGHT HERE ON MY NATIVE SOIL, I 

[Captioner] 00:01:46
HAVE WITNESSED IT A TROS ITS OF 

[Captioner] 00:01:47
RACISM, DISCRIMINATION WITH MY 

[Captioner] 00:01:49
FOUR SONS, MY HUSBAND, AND MY 

[Captioner] 00:01:49
FAMILY.

[Captioner] 00:01:51
SO I GET IT.

[Captioner] 00:01:54
BUT THAT'S NOT WHY YOU ELECTED 

[Captioner] 00:01:57
ME FOR MY PERSONAL -- MY 

[Captioner] 00:01:58
PERSONAL STORIES.

[Captioner] 00:02:02
YOU ELECTED ME TO MAKE DECISIONS 

[Captioner] 00:02:03
THAT IMPACT THE LIVES OF THE 

[Captioner] 00:02:06
PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN FREMONT, AND 

[Captioner] 00:02:07
THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING, AND WE 

[Captioner] 00:02:09
MAY NOT AGREE, AND YOU MAY NOT 

[Captioner] 00:02:12
LIKE IT, EVERYBODY MAY NOT BE 

[Captioner] 00:02:13
HAPPY, BUT I'M DOING WHAT I KNOW 

[Captioner] 00:02:15
WHEN I LAY MY HEAD DOWN AT NIGHT 

[Captioner] 00:02:15
I CAN SLEEP WELL.

[Captioner] 00:02:18
SO I'M GOING TO MAKE THIS 

[Captioner] 00:02:19
MOTION, AND I'M HOPING THAT I 

[Captioner] 00:02:21
WILL GAIN SUPPORT AND THAT WE 

[Captioner] 00:02:24
CAN MOVE THIS FORWARD, AND END 

[Captioner] 00:02:25
THIS SO WE CAN GET ON WITH THE 

[Captioner] 00:02:28
BUSINESS OF HOMELESSNESS AND ALL 

[Captioner] 00:02:30

[Captioner] 00:02:31
ABOUT THE OTHER ISSUES THAT ARE 

[Captioner] 00:02:34
GOING ON HERE IN FREMONT AND NOT 

[Captioner] 00:02:34

[Captioner] 00:02:38
THEREFORE, I AM REQUESTING THAT 

[Captioner] 00:02:41
EACH CITY COUNCILMEMBER SIGN A 

[Captioner] 00:02:46
FINAL STATEMENT THAT I JUST 

[Captioner] 00:02:48
