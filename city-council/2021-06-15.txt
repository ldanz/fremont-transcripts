NEXT WE'LL RETURN BACK TO THE

TONIGHT I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE A PROCLAMATION AGAIN THAT FOCUS ON THIS, 
19:07:55 WHICH IS NATIONAL NIGHT OUT.
WHICH WILL BE AUGUST 3RD, 2021.
 WHEREAS, THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF 
19:08:00 TOWN WATCH IS SPONSORING THE “38TH ANNUAL NATIONAL NIGHT OUT,” A NATIONWIDE COMMUNITY-BUILDING AND 
19:08:10 CRIME PREVENTION AWARENESS NIGHT ON AUGUST 3, 2021; AND WHEREAS, THE 38TH ANNIVERSARY OF NATIONAL NIGHT OUT 
19:08:16 PROVIDES A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE FREMONT COMMUNITY TO JOIN WITH THOUSANDS OF OTHER COMMUNITIES ACROSS 
19:08:19 THE COUNTRY IN CELEBRATING GRASSROOTS COMMUNITY-BUILDING THROUGH NEIGHBORHOOD BLOCK PARTIES; AND 
19:08:26 WHEREAS, IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT ALL COMMUNITY MEMBERS OF FREMONT BE AWARE OF THE IMPORTANCE OF CRIME PREVENTION 
19:08:34 PROGRAMS AND THE IMPACT THEIR PARTICIPATION CAN HAVE ON REDUCING CRIME, DRUGS AND VIOLENCE IN FREMONT; 
19:08:41 AND WHEREAS, THE CITY OF FREMONT’S COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT GOAL CALLS FOR THE SUPPORT AND EXPANSION OF NATIONAL

19:09:55 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU VERY MUCH, MONICA.
WE LOOK FORWARD TO IT.

19:10:02 I THINK THE MOST WE HAD IN ONE NIGHT WAS ALMOST 130 OR 150 PARTIES, AND SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE OPPORTUNITY TO 
19:10:13 BE ABLE TO RETURN AND SHARE IN THAT WITH OUR COMMUNITY.
AT THIS TIME, I'LL TURN IT BACK TO 
19:10:17 PUBLIC COMMUNICATIONS.
ORAL COMMUNICATIONS ARE FOR  ITEMS THAT ARE NOT AGENDIZED ON OUR CALENDAR 
19:10:21 THIS EVENING.
AND WE'LL ALLOW FOR 3 MINUTES PER SPEAKER.

19:10:28 I SEE BLAIR BEEKMAN AND -- OKAY, I SEE MORE PEOPLE SHOWING UP, BUT WE'LL BEGIN WITH BLAIR BEEKMAN.

19:10:31 THANK YOU SO MUCH.
3 MINUTES, PLEASE.
>> HI.

19:10:39 THANK YOU.
BLBLAIR BEEKMAN HERE.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR MEETING  TODAY.

19:10:50 I WROTE THREE TIMES TO CITY GOVERNMENT LAST WEEK ABOUT AN ISSUE OF MEALS SERVICE FOR TRANSITIONAL HOUSING 
19:11:00 PLACES, AND I FINALLY GOT BACK YESTERDAY A REALLY NICE LETTER OF REALLY WHAT TO DESCRIBE OF THE PROGRAM 
19:11:05 IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS.
I JUST WANTED TO THANK YOURSELVES THAT IT'S LIKE MISSION ACCOMPLISHED, WE'RE 
19:11:17 LIKE WORKING ON THE SUBJECT AND IT TAKES TIME AND EFFORT, I'M NEW AT HOW TO ASK QUESTIONS OF MY CITY 
19:11:24 GOVERNMENT, AND MY CITY GOVERNMENT HAS REALLY COME THROUGH FOR MYSELF, SO THANK  YOU, AND I CAN LEARN TO ASK 
19:11:31 NOW, AND IT TAKES A BIT OF EFFORT AND PERSEVERANCE TO WORK ON IT, AND WITH THAT IN MIND, YOU KNOW, I LISTEN TO 
19:11:40 YOUR -- TO PUBLIC COMMENT LAST WEEK ABOUT BUDGET ITEMS AND PEOPLE WERE HAVING PROBLEMS WITH BUDGET ISSUES, 
19:11:48 THEY WERE WRITING LETTERS TO GET CLARITY, AND THEY COULDN'T GET BACK LETTERS, AND -- FROM CITY GOVERNMENT.

19:11:56 AND IT'S HARD WHEN THAT HAPPENS.
PEOPLE OFFERED SOME REALLY INTERESTING IDEAS ABOUT BUDGETING, AND I WANTED TO 
19:12:01 REMIND, YOU KNOW, WE ARE -- THE CITY OF SAN JOSÉ, YOU KNOW, WHERE I WORK A LOT, I THINK YOU PROBABLY ARE LEARNING 
19:12:09 THAT BY NOW, THEY'RE WORKING THE PAST MONTH OR SO, YOU KNOW, THEIR CITY GOVERNMENT COMMITTEE  AGENDAS AND 
19:12:17 COUNCIL AGENDAS HAVE MANY ITEMS ABOUT NATIONAL -- OR NATURAL DISASTER PREPAREDNESS ISSUES AT THIS TIME.

19:12:23 I THINK IF WE START GEARING OURSELVES TOWARD THAT THINKING AND LEARN HOW TO INCLUDE THAT INTO OUR EVERYDAY WORK 
19:12:32 PRACTICES AND POSSIBLY OUR BUDGETING, THAT ADDRESSES IDEAS OF EQUITY AND REIMAGINE AND IDEAS OF HEALTH AND 
19:12:40 HUMAN SERVICES ACTUALLY, AND IT JUST KIND OF PREPARES US FOR THE NEXT COUPLE YEARS, WE MAY BE IN FOR A BIT 
19:12:45 OF A BUMPY RIDE.
THERE'S WILDFIRE ISSUES, THERE'S SEA LEVEL RISE ISSUES, CLIMATE CHANGE AND 
19:12:49 A POSSIBLE LARGE EARTHQUAKE IN THE NEXT FEW  YEARS.
AND IF NOT IN THE NEXT FEW  YEARS, IN 
19:12:56 THE NEXT FIVE YEARS AND THE NEXT 10 YEARS.
SO I HOPE WE CAN CONSIDER NATURAL 
19:13:04 DISASTER PREPAREDNESS IDEAS, BUDGETARY IDEAS, HOW TO MAKE DECISIONS WITH THAT THINKING, AND THAT WAY I THINK YOU CAN 
19:13:11 MORE EASILY WRITE BACK TO THE PUBLIC COMMENT PERSON WHO COULDN'T GET A LETTER BACK.

19:13:17 SO GOOD LUCK IN THOSE EFFORTS.
I HOPE I'M MAKING SOMETHING CLEAR.
I'M TRYING MY BEST TO MAK CLEAR WHAT 
19:13:24 I'M FEELING IS HAPPENING IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS, AND IF WE START MORE OPENLY TALKING ABOUT THAT, WE CAN PREPARE 
19:13:31 BETTER, WE CAN BE SAFER AND WE'LL MAKE BETTER, SMARTER DECISIONS OUT OF IT.
SO THANKS FOR YOUR TIME AND PAY 
19:13:35 EXCELLENCE.
I HOPE I'M PRACTICING HOW TO DO A GOOD JOB WITH THIS.

19:13:39 THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
NEXT SPEAKER IS SHARON SCHARFF.

19:13:53 WELCOME.
>> IS THE AUDIO OKAY?
>> Mayor Mei: YES.

19:13:55 >> OKAY, THANK YOU.
GOOD EVENING.
I'M SHARON SCHARFF.

19:14:03 AND I WOULD LIKE TO CONGRATULATE HANS LARSEN AND THE CITY COUNCIL FOR ATTAINING A LEVEL OF INCOMPETENCE IN 
19:14:09 THE MATTER OF RANCHO ARROYO PARKWAY THAT I DIDN'T THINK WAS POSSIBLE.
LET'S RECAP.

19:14:17 WITHOUT WARNING, FIELD INVESTIGATION, LEGAL INVESTIGATION OR A REQUEST FROM THE RESIDENTS, HANS LARSEN CREATED NEW 
19:14:25 PARKING, BRINGING MORE CARS AND MORE TRAFFIC AND MORE TRASH TO A UNIQUE AND SAFE STREET THAT WAS DESIGNED WITHOUT 
19:14:31 IT.
AT THE SAME TIME, TRAFFIC FLOW WAS BEING CONSTRICTED BY ELIMINATING AND 
19:14:37 NARROWING LANES, RESULTING IN SEVERELY RESTRICTED ACCESS TO THE AREA, WHICH, OF COURSE, INCLUDES EMERGENCY 
19:14:43 VEHICLES.
THE PROCESS IS RESULTING IN AN ESTHETICALLY DAMAGED MORE DANGEROUS 
19:14:47 STREET ON THIS UNIQUE STRETCH OF ROADWAY FOR WALKERS, BIKERS AND DRIVERS.

19:14:55 OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS, WE BROUGHT YOU THE FACTS THAT BROUGHT RESTORING THE NEIGHBORHOOD AS INTENDED,  
19:15:03 DESIGNED AND PROTECTED.
THE VERY DOCUMENTS HANS LARSEN AND HENRY LEVINE WAVE AROUND CONTAIN VERY 
19:15:09 IMPORTANT PROVISIONS REGARDING THE EXEMPTIONS AND ADDED FACTORS THAT MUST BE ACRESTED IN AN UNUSUAL SITUATION OR 
19:15:13 UNIQUE STREETS.
THEY ALSO SPECIFICALLY STATE THAT NEIGHBORHOOD CHARACTER SHOULD BE 
19:15:18 PRESERVED WHEREVER POSSIBLE.
AND EVERY STREET MUST BE EVALUATED ON ITS OWN.

19:15:25 NONE OF THIS WAS CONSIDERED IN THE WORK DONE, AND THE RESULT HAS A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON THE RESIDENTS' QUALITY OF 
19:15:34 LIFE, A LOSS OF CHARACTER OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD, AND DANGEROUS ACCESS COMING OR GOING.

19:15:40 OF COURSE NONE OF YOU LIVE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND ARE NOT AFFECTED IN THE LEAST BY THE DANGEROUS AND UGLY 
19:15:45 CHANGES TO RANCHO ARROYO PARKWAY.
SO THOUSANDS OF TAXPAYER DOLLARS WERE DIVERTED FOR MORE PRESSING PROJECTS.

19:15:55 MONEY SPENT THAT HAD BEEN AUTHORIZED FOR OTHER USES AND THOUSANDS OF MAN HOURS WASTED TO CHANGE A SAFE STREET 
19:15:59 TO A LESS SAFE STREET TO A BAD CITY STREET WITH A BAD INAPPROPRIATE DESIGN.

19:16:05 YET UNDER A MILE AWAY, RESIDENTS ARE BEING KILLED ON J STREET AND NILES BOULEVARD.

19:16:13 IN AREAS THAT HAVE BEEN BROUGHT TO YOUR ATTENTION BECAUSE OF THE DANGERS, WHILE A SAFE AREA IS BEING 
19:16:19 COMPROMISED.
AGAIN, MY HAT IS OFF TO YOU.
THIS MAY BE THE MOST DISHONEST WORK 
19:16:24 THE CITY HAS TRIED TO JUSTIFY AFTER THE FACT.
THE LACK OF INTEGRITY, FISCAL 
19:16:29 RESPONSIBILITY, INTELLIGENCE AND COMMON SENSE SETS A NEW LOW FOR CITY GOVERNMENT WORK.

19:16:35 YOU STILL HAVE A CHANCE TO DO THE RIGHT THING AND RESTORE RANCHO ARROYO PARKWAY TO THE SAFE, ESTHETICALLY 
19:16:42 PLEASING UNIQUE STREET IT WAS DESIGNED TO BE AND STILL SHOULD BE UNDER CURRENT GUIDELINES.

19:17:00 THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
NEXT SPEAKER IS HERRENDE DAVAY.

19:17:03 >> HELLO.
IS AUDIO OKAY?
>>

19:17:06 >> Mayor Mei: YES, IT IS.
>> GOOD EVENING, EVERYONE.
UNTIL RECENTLY I WAS A STUDENT AT 
19:17:12 IRVINGTON HIGH SCHOOL AND AS OF YESTERDAY, I'M NOW A PROUD IRVINGTON ALUMNI, AND I'VE BEEN A RESIDENT OF A 
19:17:17 WONDERFUL CITY OF FREMONT FOR ABOUT EIGHT YEARS NOW.
TODAY I'M HERE TO TALK ABOUT THE BAPS 
19:17:27 SHAIRTS COVID RELIEF EFFORTS.
IT'S A GLOBAL CHARITY ACTIVE IN NINE COUNTRIES ACROSS FIVE CONTINENTS 
19:17:31 COMMITTED TO EDUCATIONAL SERVICES, HEALTH AND WELLNESS, HUMANITARIAN RELIEF.

19:17:37 I HAVE BEEN FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO BE A PART OF VARIOUS BAPS CHARITIES SUCH AS BLOOD DRIVES WHERE I HELP WITH 
19:17:41 REGISTRATION AS WELL AS HEALTH FAIRS WHERE I'VE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO VARIOUS GUESTS AND SET UP THE 
19:17:46 EVENT.
VOLUNTEERS DRIVE OUR EFFORTS INCLUDING THE COVID RELIEF EFFORT IN NORTH 
19:17:49 AMERICA AND RAISE FUNDS TO PROVIDE ESSENTIAL ITEMS TO THOSE ON THE FRONT LINE.

19:17:56 WHEN THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC HIT IN 2020, EMERGENCY PHYSICIANS AND OTHER HEALTHCARE WORKERS WERE FACING SEVERE 
19:18:02 SHORTAGES OF PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT OR PPE, LIKE MASKS, GOWNS, FACE SHIELDS AND EYEWEAR, LEAVING 
19:18:08 MILLIONS OF PEOPLE AT RISK IN THE MIDST OF THIS OUTBREAK.
AS A PART OF ITS NATIONWIDE EFFORTS, 
19:18:14 THE CHAPTER IN THE BAY AREA AMID THE SHORTAGE AND IN THE CONTINUING FIGHT AGAINST THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC LAUNCHED 
19:18:22 ITS RELIEF EFFORTS AND WAS ABLE TO DONATE OVER 30,000 PIECES OF PPE TO FRONT LINE WORKERS.

19:18:32 IT GAVE OVER 9,000 PIECES OF P PE. INCLUDING 3,000 MASKS AND 6,000 SHOE COVERINGS AND OTHER 11,000 PIECES TO 
19:18:37 KAISER PERMANENTE HOSPITAL IN FREMONT INCLUDING MASKS, GLOVES AND FACE SHIELDS, IT SAID IN A STATEMENT.

19:18:45 TO THE FREMONT UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT, THEY DONATED PACKAGED FOOD ITEMS.
IN ADDITION, IT DONATED 5,000 MASKS TO 
19:18:56 WASHINGTON HOSPITAL IN FREMONT.
THE ORGANIZATION ALSO GAVE MASK CONTAINERS ALONG WITH PACKAGED FOOD 
19:19:03 AND DRINKS AND APPRECIATING THE DONATION, MS. KIMBERLY HARTS SAID, IT IS SO IMPORTANT TO ENSURE THE SAFETY 
19:19:07 OF OUR PATIENTS AND OUR STAFF AND THIS DONATION HELPS A LOT.
WE APPRECIATE IT SO MUCH.

19:19:14 IN CONCLUSION, I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE OFFICES OF THE CITY OF FREMONT FOR GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE 
19:19:19 WITH YOU SOME OF THE WORK THAT BAPS CHARITIES DOES AND ALSO THANK YOU FOR ALL THE WORK THEY HAVE DONE AND 
19:19:23 CONTINUE TO DO TO KEEP OUR RESIDENTS SAFE DURING COVID.
THANK YOU.

19:19:35 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU SO MUCH.
AND NEXT IS SASHEEF DAVAY.
>> IS MY AUDIO GOOD?

19:19:36 >> Mayor Mei: YES, IT IS.
THANK YOU.
>> AWESOME.

19:19:41 GOOD EVENING, EVERYONE.
I AM A RISING JUNIOR AT IRVINGTON HIGH SCHOOL.

19:19:47 I'VE BEEN A RESIDENT OF OUR WONDERFUL CITY OF FREMONT FOR EIGHT YEARS NOW, AND TODAY I'M HERE TO TALK ABOUT THE 
19:19:53 BAPS CHARITIES WALK-A-THON WHOSE BENEVOLENT ACTIVITIES I'M PROUD TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH.

19:19:58 AS MENTIONED BY THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER, BAPS CHARITIES IS A GLOBAL CHARITY ACTIVE IN NINE COUNTRIES ACROSS FIVE 
19:20:04 DIFFERENT CONTINENTS COMMITTED TO COMMUNITY SERVICES, EDUCATIONAL SERVICES, HEALTH AND WELLNESS, 
19:20:14 ENVIRONMENTAL INITIATIVES, AND HUMANITARIAN RELIEF.
I'VE BEEN FORTUNATE ENOUGH WORKING ON 
19:20:19 VARIOUS OTHER PROJECTS WITH OTHERS IN OUR BAPS COMMUNITY.
VOLUNTEERS ULTIMATELY DRIVE OUR 
19:20:26 EFFORTS INCLUDING THE ANNUAL WALKATHON DEDICATING A PORTION OF THEIR LIVES IN SELFLESS SERVICE OF OTHERS IN THE 
19:20:31 NEIGHBORHOODS AS WELL AS GLOBALLY.
THE WALKATHON IS A NATIONAL EVENT THAT TAKES PLACE IN OVER 76 DIFFERENT 
19:20:39 LOCATIONS WITH OVER 23,000 PARTICIPANTS WITH BENEFICIARIES THAT HAVE INCLUDED THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION AND IN 
19:20:44 KEEPING WITH ITS ENVIRONMENTAL INITIATIVE, THE NATURE CONSERVANCY.
THE BAPS CHARITIES WALK-A-THON HAS 
19:20:53 HELPED THE NATURE CONSERVANCY PLANT A TOTAL OF 361,000 TREES.
IN THE BAY AREA, MILIPITAS CHAPTER OF 
19:21:02 BAPS CHARITIES HAS BEEN ORGANIZING WALK-A-THONS FOR OVER 18 YEARS TO SUPPORT LOCAL SCHOOLS, HOSPITALS, 
19:21:05 NATIONAL HEALTH ORGANIZATIONS AND CONSERVATION GROUPS AS WELL AS BENEFICIARIES SUCH AS THE AMERICAN 
19:21:11 HEART ASSOCIATION, SOUTH ASIAN HEART CENTER, MILIPITAS UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT, AND THE SILICON VALLEY 
19:21:17 EDUCATION FOUNDATION.
DURING THE ONGOING PANDEMIC,, THEY RECOGNIZE THAT MANY CAUSES NEED FUNDS 
19:21:23 TO KEEP FLOWING AND THIS YEAR'S BENEFICIARY IS THE SUSAN G. KOMEN FOUNDATION, THE WORLD'S LARGEST 
19:21:28 NON-PROFIT SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR THE FIGHT AGAINST BREAST CANCER.
GIVEN THE COVID RESTRICTIONS AND CDC 
19:21:34 GUIDELINES ON SAFETY AND GATHERINGS, THE WALKATHON WILL BE PARTICIPANTS WALKING IN THEIR OWN NEIGHBORHOODS AND 
19:21:39 PARKS.
TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT THE WALKATHON, PLEASE VISIT  WWW.BAPSCHARITIES.ORG.

19:21:45 IN CONCLUSION, I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE OFFICES OF THE CITY OF FREMONT FOR GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE 
19:21:51 WITH YOU INFORMATION ABOUT THE BAPS CHARITIES WALKATHON AND I'D ALSO LIKE TO THANK THE MANY OFFICIALS FROM 
19:21:58 VARIOUS DIFFERENT CITIES THAT HAVE IN THE PAST COME OUT IN SUPPORT OF THE WALKATHON BY WALKING WITH US.

19:22:08 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
SO I THINK THAT'S GREAT TO HEAR THAT MANY PEOPLE WANTED TO HELP OUR CITY 
19:22:16 AND WE APPRECIATE ALL THOSE IN CHARITY AND ALSO IN HEALTH AND WELLNESS, AND I KNOW YOUR EVENTS FROM JUNE 19TH 
19:22:21 THROUGH 30TH, SO HOPEFULLY WE'LL BE ABLE TO HAVE JOIN US IN BEING HEALTHY AND WALKING.

19:22:29 NEXT, I WANTED TO RETURN BACK TO THE ITEMS THAT WERE PULLED OFF OF THE CONSENT CALENDAR, AND I BELIEVE THAT'S 
19:22:34  ITEM 2D AS IN DAVID.
AND I BELIEVE THAT WAS REQUESTED BY COUNCILMEMBER COX.

19:22:41 IF YOU WANT TO ADDRESS THAT ITEM AT THIS TIME.
>> Councilmember Cox: THANK YOU, MAYOR 
19:22:45 MEI.
I WOULD LIKE TO VOICE MY CONCERN ON WHY I'M NOT SUPPORTING THE SAFE 
19:22:53 PARKING ORDINANCE.
COMMUNITY SAFETY IS ONE OF MY TOP PRIORITIES FOR ALL FREMONT RESIDENTS.

19:23:00 AND THIS ORDINANCE DOES NOT ADDRESS NOR DEMONSTRATE HOW FREMONT RESIDENTS WILL BE KEPT SAFE AT ALL TIMES.

19:23:07 HOW CAN YOU ROLL OUT AN ORDINANCE THAT DOES NOT REQUIRE OR CALL IT SAFE WHEN YOU'RE NOT DOING ANY BACKGROUND 
19:23:14 SCREENING, NO DRIVER LICENSES REQUIRED, NO CAR REGISTRATION, NO CAR INSURANCE.

19:23:21 AND THE FREMONT IRVINGTON DISTRICT, WE'VE HAD THREE SEXUAL ASSAULTS THAT OCCURRED LAST MONTH.

19:23:29  AGAINST WOMEN IN BROAD DAYLIGHT, NEAR OUR IRVINGTON HIGH SCHOOL, AND OUR IRVINGTON COMMUNITY PARK, WHERE 
19:23:37 CHILDREN, FAMILIES, FRIENDS, LOVED ONES COME TO THIS AREA.
I JUST CANNOT SUPPORT AN ORDINANCE 
19:23:46 THAT DOES NOT SUPPORT COMMUNITY SAFETY AND HAVE PROVISIONS LISTED AND EXPLICITLY LISTED IN THE ORDINANCE.

19:23:57 WE MUST KEEP ALL OF OUR FREMONT RESIDENTS SAFE AT ALL TIMES.
I ALSO, IN MY OWN PERSONAL OPINION, DO 
19:24:04 NOT BELIEVE THAT WE'RE IN COMPLIANCE WHEN ANYONE OWNS AND HAS A CAR IN THEIR POSSESSION, BECAUSE ACCORDING TO 
19:24:11 THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF MOTORIZED VEHICLES, THE REQUIREMENTS THAT ALL CAR OPERATORS ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE A 
19:24:17 VALID DRIVER'S LICENSE, CAR REGISTRATION, AND MAINTAIN INSURANCE AT ALL TIME.

19:24:23 AGAIN, I CANNOT SUPPORT SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T LINE UP WITH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA REQUIREMENTS.

19:24:31 I ALSO, WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT SOME OTHER MUNICIPAL CODES, WE'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT THINGS ARE CONSISTENT.

19:24:39 WE'RE DOING A FINE JOB AS IN TONIGHT'S AGENDA AND 2C WHERE WE'RE REQUIRING ALL THE SMALL BUSINESSES LIKE ICE 
19:24:49 CREAM  VENDORS, MOTORIZED OR THE MOBILE TRUCKS, BACKGROUND CHECKS AND BE CLEARED BEFORE THE CITY OF FREMONT CAN 
19:24:56 ISSUE A BUSINESS LICENSE OR PERMIT.
SO WHY ARE WE NOT REQUIRING THAT IN THE PROPOSED SAFE PARKING ORDINANCE 
19:25:00 THAT COULD BE LISTED IN THAT ORDINANCE?
AGAIN, I CANNOT SUPPORT SOMETHING 
19:25:08 THAT'S NOT CONSISTENT AND FAIR AND OUR MUNICIPAL  CODES.
YOU KNOW, LAST MONTH I ALSO ATTENDED A 
19:25:17 COMMUNITY UNITY RALLY THAT WAS FOR SUPPORTING THE IRVINGTON DISTRICT AND TO SHOW THAT WE ARE TAKING COMMUNITY 
19:25:24 SAFETY A FIRST PRIORITY WITH ALL THAT HAS HAPPENED THERE.
AND ON TOP OF THAT, I WANT TO MAKE 
19:25:31 SURE THAT THE RESIDENTS ARE ALL SAFE AT ALL TIMES, AND THAT AS CITY LEADERS, I'M ASKING EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU 
19:25:45 TO RE-THINK YOUR VOTE ON THIS MEASURE.
BECAUSE IT IS OUR DUTY, ELECTED BY THE PEOPLE OF THE RESIDENTS OF FREMONT, TO 
19:25:52 MAKE SURE THAT WE MAKE DECISIONS THAT ENSURE THAT ALL FREMONT RESIDENTS ARE SAFE AT ALL TIMES.

19:26:00 THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
AND I SEE WE HAVE A RAISED HAND BY 
19:26:07 COUNCILMEMBER JONES, AND ALSO I THINK THERE'S A PUBLIC  COMMENT.
>> Councilmember Jones: THANK YOU, 
19:26:10 MADAME MAYOR.
IF I COULD JUST GET A CLARIFICATION FROM CITY ATTORNEY MARGOLIS.

19:26:18 THE ITEM AS LISTED IS REGARDING STRICTLY A ZONING CHANGE AND NOT THE PROGRAM SPECIFICS ITSELF, IS THAT 
19:26:24 CORRECT?
>> MS. MARGOLIS:  THAT IS CORRECT.
>> Councilmember Jones: THANK YOU.

19:26:32 WITH THAT, AFTER THE PUBLIC COMMENT, I'D BE HAPPY TO MAKE A MOTION TO APPROVE THE ITEM ONCE AGAIN.

19:26:37 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
I'D LIKE TO CALL THE PUBLIC SPEAKER LISA DANZ.

19:26:42 >> I'M SPEAKING IN SUPPORT OF THE SAFE PARKING PROGRAM AND JUST WANT TO ADDRESS THE COMMENTS THAT WE JUST 
19:26:47 HEARD.
AS WE HEARD FROM CITY STAFF LAST WEEK, THIS PROGRAM WAS MODELED ON SUCCESSFUL 
19:26:54 PROGRAMS IN NEIGHBORING COMMUNITIES, AND THE LOW BARRIER TO ENTRY IS CRITICAL TO MAKING IT ACCESSIBLE TO 
19:26:59 ALL THE PEOPLE WHO REALLY NEED IT.
SO I DO URGE EVERYBODY TO VOTE FOR SAFE PARKING.

19:27:07 THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
AND I HAVE A MOTION BY COUNCILMEMBER 
19:27:16 JONES AND IS THERE A SECOND FOR THIS ITEM?
>> Councilmember Kassan: I'LL SECOND.

19:27:19 >> Mayor Mei: SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN.
THANK YOU.

19:27:26 ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE.
>> Ms. Gauthier: COUNCILMEMBER COX, NO.

19:27:35 COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN, AYE.
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, AYE.
COUNCILMEMBER JONES, AYE.

19:27:42 COUNCILMEMBER KENG, AYE.
VICE MAYOR SHAO, AYE.
MAYOR MEI, AYE.

19:27:49 SO ITEM 2D PASSES WITH SIX AYES AND ONE NAY.
THANK YOU.

19:27:59 NEXT WE WILL RETURN TO OUR REGULARLY SCHEDULED ITEMS THIS EVENING, AND WE'LL BEGIN WITH ITEM 5A, WHICH IS THE 
19:28:05 RENT REVIEW ORDINANCE ANNUAL REPORT AND PROGRAM FEE, AND THIS WILL BE PRESENTED BY OUR FINANCE DIRECTOR, 
19:28:14 DAVID PERSSELIN, AND OUR CDBG ADMINISTRATOR, ROBERT LOPEZ.
WELCOME THIS EVENING.

19:28:19 >> Mr. Persselin: THANKS, MAYOR MEI.
WE DO NOT HAVE A PRESENTATION TONIGHT BUT ARE PREPARED TO ANSWER ANY 
19:28:28 QUESTIONS.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
I'M GOING TO SEE IF THERE'S 
19:28:33 QUESTIONS.
THERE'S NO QUESTIONS FROM THE COUNCILMEMBERS, AND OPEN TO PUBLIC 
19:28:37 COMMENT, I SEE ONE SPEAKER AND THAT IS BLAIR BEEKMAN.
WELCOME.

19:28:40 >> HI.
THANK YOU.
BLAIR BEEKMAN HERE.

19:28:50 HOPEFULLY IT COULD BE APPROPRIATE TO TALK ABOUT EVICTION MORATORIUM IDEAS AS PART OF WHAT SOUNDS LIKE YOU HAVE 
19:29:02 RENT -- TENANTS' RIGHTS IDEAS AND OWNERS' RIGHTS IDEAS FOR THIS ITEM.
THE EVICTION MORATORIUM, IT'S THERE TO 
19:29:10 SERVE BOTH TENANTS AND OWNERS AND HELP THEM NAVIGATE THIS DIFFICULT TIME, AND I JUST WANTED TO REMIND OF THE 
19:29:14 IMPORTANCE OF STATE AND FEDERAL FUNDING AND THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO BE AFRAID OF IT.

19:29:23 AND THAT IS A LOT FOR THE EVERYDAY PUBLIC TO -- THAT'S A TOUGH HURDLE TO NOT BE AFRAID OF GOVERNMENT FUNDING 
19:29:33 THAT CAN REALLY DO A LOT, AND I THINK GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS ARE REALLY TRYING TO WORK -- TO WORK FOR THE GOAL OF 
19:29:38 100% FORGIVENESS IN THE FUTURE, BECAUSE COVID-19 WAS NOT THE FAULT OF THE EVERYDAY PERSON.

19:29:43 OR THE EVERYDAY OWNER.
AND THEREFORE, YOU KNOW, WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT A WAY THAT THEY DON'T 
19:29:52 HAVE TO BE HELD RESPONSIBLE TO PAY BACK ITS DEBT BURDENS..
ON THE SURFACE, IT'S A RIDICULOUS 
19:30:00 NOTION THAT WE ACTUALLY DO HAVE TO PAY BACK THE DEBT BURDEN CAUSED BY A FEW ELITES THAT COULD HAVE STARTED THIS 
19:30:08 COVID PROCESS IN THE FIRST PLACE.
SO WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS HOW TO GET OUT OF THAT CYCLE AND HOW TO ADDRESS 
19:30:14 IN OPEN POSITIVE  WAYS, HEALING WAYS TO ADDRESS THESE SORT OF ISSUES.
GOOD LUCK IN THE WORK THAT YOU'LL NEED 
19:30:24 TO DO AND HOW WE CAN JUST NOT BE AFRAID.
IT TAKES A LOT TO NOT BE AFRAID OF THE 
19:30:33 FUNDING POSSIBILITIES WE CAN WORK TOWARDS, AND YOU KNOW, IT'S WAYS THAT DOESN'T HAVE TO HURT EACH OTHER.

19:30:41 AND I THINK THAT'S INTERESTING WORK AND EFFORT, AND SO GOOD LUCK IN WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO TO DO THAT, AND I HOPE IT 
19:30:49 CAN BE EASY FOR GOVERNMENT TO TALK ABOUT THESE ISSUES WITH THE PUBLIC AND FOR THE PUBLIC, THEY CAN BE RECEPTIVE 
19:30:56 AND LEARN HOW TO NOT BE AFRAID THAT THEY CAN ASK, AND THAT'S THE DYNAMIC WE'RE IN IN THIS LIFE AT THIS TIME, 
19:31:00 AND GOOD LUCK HOW WE CAN DO THAT AND MOVE FORWARD TOGETHER.
THANK YOU.

19:31:09 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
AT THIS TIME, I'LL TURN IT BACK OVER TO THE COUNCIL FOR ANY CLARIFYING 
19:31:17 QUESTIONS.
>> Councilmember Cox: YES.
>> Mayor Mei: COUNCILMEMBER COX, DO 
19:31:19 YOU HAVE YOUR HAND RAISED?
I'M SORRY.
>> Councilmember Cox: YES.

19:31:26 THANK YOU.
I JUST WANTED TO DOUBLE-CHECK, THIS IS A REVIEW THAT IS DONE ANNUALLY THAT WE 
19:31:38 WILL SEE, AND IT'S ADJUSTED BASED ON THE NUMBER OF RESIDENTIAL UNITS?
IS THAT HOW I'M UNDERSTANDING, AND IT 
19:31:41 ADJUSTS BASED ON ECONOMICS?
HOW DOES THAT KIND OF COME UP TO A FORMULA?

19:31:50 TO BE ABLE TO COME TO THE NUMBER OF WHATEVER X NUMBERS PER UNITS?
>> Mr. Persselin: COUNCILMEMBER COX, 
19:32:02 WE ARE A COST RECOVERY PROGRAM, SO EVERY YEAR, WE LOOK AT THE BUDGET FOR THE NEXT YEAR, WHAT IT'S GOING TO COST 
19:32:10 TO RUN THE PROGRAM, AND WE DIVIDE THAT COST BY THE NUMBER OF UNITS TO DETERMINE WHAT THE FEE PER UNIT WILL 
19:32:23 BE.
IF WE FINISH THE FISCAL YEAR WITH AN ENDING BALANCE, WE REDUCE WHATEVER 
19:32:31 THAT BUDGET REQUIREMENT FOR THE NEXT YEAR IS BY THAT REMAINING BALANCE.
SO WE'RE COST RECOVERY, AND WE'RE NOT 
19:32:40 ACCUMULATING A BALANCE IN THE FUND.
>> Councilmember Cox: SO IT'S A CARRYOVER IF YOU DON'T USE IT THE 
19:32:44 PREVIOUS YEAR?
DO YOU CARRY OVER THAT MONEY, RIGHT?
>> Mr. Persselin: SO WHAT WE'RE 
19:32:52 SHOWING IN THE STAFF REPORT IS THAT WE ANTICIPATE FINISHING THE YEAR WITH ABOUT $80,000  REMAINING.

19:33:01 SO WE ARE REDUCING THE AMOUNT WE NEED TO COLLECT FOR NEXT YEAR BY $80,000.
>> Councilmember Cox: OKAY.

19:33:13 >> Mayor Mei: SEEING NO ADDITIONAL CLARIFYING QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME, MAY I GET A MOTION TO ACCEPT THE REPORT AS 
19:33:15 IT STANDS?
>> Councilmember Jones: MOVE TO APPROVE.

19:33:20 >> Councilmember Cox: SECOND.
>> Mayor Mei: MOVED BY COUNCILMEMBER JONES AND SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER 
19:33:26 COX.
ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE.
>> Ms. Gauthier: COUNCILMEMBER COX, 
19:33:31 AYE.
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN, AYE.
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, AYE.

19:33:38 COUNCILMEMBER JONES, AYE.
COUNCILMEMBER KENG, AYE.
VICE MAYOR SHAO, AYE.

19:33:45 MAYOR MEI, AYE.
AND SO THE MOTION PASSES TO ACCEPT THE REPORT UNANIMOUSLY.

19:33:58 NEXT ON OUR AGENDA ITEM THIS EVENING IS THE SECOND PUBLIC HEARING AND ADOPTION OF OUR FISCAL YEAR 2021-2022 OPERATING 
19:34:05 BUDGET AND APPROPRIATIONS LIMIT, AND WE HAVE OUR FINANCE DIRECTOR DAVID PERSSELIN AVAILABLE FOR ANY 
19:34:10 QUESTIONS.
FIRST I WILL OPEN TO QUESTIONS FROM THE COUNCILMEMBERS.

19:34:26 SEEING NONE, I'LL OPEN TO QUESTIONS FROM THE PUBLIC.
WE HAVE ONE SPEAKER AND THAT IS BLAIR 
19:34:32 BEEKMAN.
WELCOME.
>> HI.

19:34:38 BLAIR BEEKMAN.
TALKING OUTSIDE TODAY.
I HAD A QUESTION TO ASK.

19:34:46 WE HAD A BIT OF A DISAGREEMENT A FEW WEEKS AGO WHEN FOR THESE BUDGET ITEMS I TRIED TO TALK ABOUT THE CENTERVILLE 
19:34:50 TRAIN STATION AND THE ARDENWOOD TRAIN STATION.
I THOUGHT THAT WOULD BE THE PART OF 
19:34:56 THE BUDGET OR PART OF THE CAPITAL BUDGET IMPROVEMENTS PROGRAM.
CAN I SPEAK ON THOSE TWO ITEMS ON THIS 
19:35:05 ITEM AT THIS TIME?
>> Mayor Mei: I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT -- DIRECTOR PERSSELIN, WE HAVE ANYTHING 
19:35:09 SPECIFIC TO THOSE TWO PROJECTS UNDER THE BUDGET.
IT MIGHT BE UNDER THE CAPITAL 
19:35:14 IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM BUT I'M NOT SURE IF THAT PROJECT IS HIGHLIGHTED.
I HAVE TO LOOK IT UP RIGHT NOW.

19:35:21 I KNOW IT'S NOT PART OF OUR GENERAL BUDGET.
I'M LOOKING FOR DIRECTOR PERSSELIN.

19:35:28 >> Mr. Persselin: I THINK IT'S PROBABLY MORE APPROPRIATE TO TALK ABOUT THOSE ITEMS AS THE  CIP AND THE CAPITAL 
19:35:31 BUDGET WHICH IS THE NEXT ITEM ON THE AGENDA.
>> THANKS.

19:35:33 I'LL WAIT UNTIL THEN.
THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:35:38 ARE THERE ANY OTHER CLARIFYING QUESTIONS?
SEEING NONE FROM THE COUNCIL, MAY I 
19:35:45 GET A MOTION TO ACCEPT AND ADOPT THE RESOLUTION?
>> Vice Mayor Shao: SO MOVED.

19:35:50 >> Mayor Mei: MOVED BY VICE MAYOR SHAO.
OR WAS THAT -- I THINK IT WAS VICE 
19:35:53 MAYOR SHAO.
>> Vice Mayor Shao: YES.
>> Mayor Mei: SECONDED BY 
19:35:56 COUNCILMEMBER JONES.
THANK YOU.
ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE.

19:36:02 >> Ms. Gauthier: COUNCILMEMBER COX, AYE.
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN, AYE.

19:36:10 COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, AYE.
COUNCILMEMBER JONES, AYE.
COUNCILMEMBER KENG, AYE.

19:36:20 VICE MAYOR SHAO, AYE.
MAYOR MEI, AYE.
SO THE ADOPTION OF THE FISCAL YEAR 
19:36:25 2021-2022 OPERATING BUDGET AND APPROPRIATIONS LIMIT HAS BEEN ACCEPTED AND PASSED UNANIMOUSLY.

19:36:31 NEXT ON OUR AGENDA ITEM THIS EVENING IS THE ITEM FOR THE CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM.

19:36:40 AND SO WE HAVE AVAILABLE WITH US THIS EVENING HANS LARSEN, THE DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC WORKS, TO ANSWER ANY 
19:36:42 QUESTIONS.
AND WE'LL BEGIN WITH QUESTIONS FROM THE COUNCILMEMBERS.

19:36:49 SEEING NONE FROM THE COUNCILMEMBERS, I BELIEVE WE HAVE A SPEAKER ON THIS ITEM, WHICH IS BLAIR BEEKMAN.

19:36:53 WELCOME.
>> HI.
THANK YOU.

19:37:00 HOPEFULLY WE WORKED OUT, THANK YOU, THAT I CAN TALK ABOUT THE CENTERVILLE TRAIN STATION AND ARDENWOOD STATION AT 
19:37:08 THIS TIME.
I NOTICED YOU HAD A CONSENT CALENDAR ITEM THAT WAS -- HAD SOME SORT OF A 
19:37:18 APPROVAL OF FUNDING FOR THE AMTRAK SYSTEM TO CONTINUE AT CENTERVILLE.
I'M INTERESTED IN HOW THE FUTURE OF 
19:37:27 THE CALIFORNIA HIGH-SPEED RAIL WILL BE WORKING, AND I'M TRYING MY DARNEDEST HOW TO CONSIDER IT.

19:37:35 I DO A LOT OF WORK IN SAN JOSÉ.
THEY WORK HARD FOR THE LIGHT -- OR FOR THE HIGH-SPEED RAIL TO EVENTUALLY END 
19:37:44 IN SAN JOSÉ OR TO GO THROUGH SAN JOSÉ, BUT I THINK WHAT I'M SEEING FOR THE TIME BEING IS THAT IF WE FOCUS AND 
19:37:55 CONCENTRATE ON THE HIGH-SPEED RAIL TO GO FROM L.A. TO MERCED TO STOCKTON TO SACRAMENTO, THAT COULD -- IT CAN BE A 
19:38:02 UNIFIED WAY TO WORK, AND WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT, YOU KNOW, THAT CAN BE OUR MAIN FOCUS AND THAT CAN CREATE FEDERAL 
19:38:11 FUNDING DOLLARS EASIER, AND IT CREATES A UNIFIED PURPOSE FOR ALL OF THE STATE TO REALLY BELIEVE IN WHAT WE'RE DOING, 
19:38:18 AND THAT WE'RE ALL FOR ONE AND ONE FOR ALL WORKING ON A PROJECT TOGETHER.
AND IT'S FROM THAT THAT THEN WE TALK 
19:38:25 ABOUT -- BECAUSE I DON'T THINK SAN JOSÉ IS SIMPLY READY OR HAS THE POLITICAL WILL TO, LIKE, YOU KNOW, WORK TOWARDS 
19:38:32 EMINENT DOMAIN ISSUES IN SAN JOSÉ AND THEY DON'T HAVE THE POLITICAL CAPITAL TO GET THE HIGH-SPEED RAIL INTO SAN 
19:38:39 JOSÉ AT THIS TIME.
BUT WHAT MAY BE POSSIBLE IS IF WE'RE WORKING TOWARDS THE HIGH-SPEED RAIL 
19:38:45 FROM THE L.A. TO SACRAMENTO LINE FROM STOCKTON, THE ACE RAIL CAN COME THROUGH FREMONT.

19:38:51 AND I GET THE FEELING THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO REPAIR THAT AT THIS TIME WITH THE ARDENWOOD STATION AND THE 
19:39:00 CENTERVILLE STATION IDEA.
AND THERE CAN BE A SECONDARY ACE RAIL FROM STOCKTON THAT CONNECTS TO THE 
19:39:05 HIGH-SPEED RAIL AND THAT CAN BRING PEOPLE IN FROM STOCKTON INTO THE BAY AREA THROUGH THE ACE RAIL AND THROUGH 
19:39:15 FREMONT.
AND SO WHILE WE DO THAT, IT'S 10 TO 15 YEARS LATER THAT THEN THE FINAL PLANS 
19:39:20 CAN -- OF THE HIGH-SPEED RAIL CAN GO INTO SAN JOSÉ ONCE THEY GET THE POLITICAL WILL AND POLITICAL CAPITAL.

19:39:28 SO YOU KNOW, I THINK YOU'RE  DOING THIS -- IT MAY BE PERMANENT, IT MAY BE TEMPORARY, BUT I'M STILL CONCERNED 
19:39:34 ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES OVER IN NILES CANYON AREA, AND YOU KNOW, AS MINIMAL TRAINS AS POSSIBLE TO GO 
19:39:41 THROUGH THERE, MAYBE LIKE FIVE A DAY, WHICH WOULD BE 25 A WEEK AT MOST IS MY HOPE FOR THAT AREA.

19:39:48 AND JUST TO TRY TO MAKE CLEAR WHAT TO EXPECT OF THIS PROJECT AT THIS TIME, THIS IS A -- YOU KNOW, MY LIFE, WHAT I 
19:39:58  TRY TO WORK TOWARDS AND TRY TO  DESCRIBE, I HOPE THIS CAN HELP A PROCESS FOR OURSELVES AND --

19:40:03 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
NEXT I'LL BRING IT BACK TO THE COUNCIL FOR QUESTIONS ON THE CAPITAL 
19:40:07 IMPROVEMENT PROGRAMS.
AND I'LL BEGIN WITH COUNCILMEMBER COX.

19:40:16 >> Councilmember Cox: I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A MOTION, SO MOVE THE FIVE-YEAR CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROJECT PROGRAM 
19:40:22 ALONG WITH THE TWO-YEAR BUDGET THAT'S BEEN NOTED IN TODAY'S AGENDA ITEM OF 5C.

19:40:30 >> Mayor Mei: SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER JONES.
SO MOTION BY COUNCILMEMBER COX AND 
19:40:38 SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER JONES.
ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE.
>> Ms. Gauthier: COUNCILMEMBER COX, 
19:40:43 AYE.
COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN, AYE.
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, AYE.

19:40:52 COUNCILMEMBER JONES, AYE.
COUNCILMEMBER KENG, AYE.
VICE MAYOR SHAO, AYE.

19:40:59 MAYOR MEI, AYE.
AND I ALSO WANTED TO RECOMMEND THAT FOR THE PUBLIC, AND I'LL COMMENT ON IT 
19:41:06 LATER TOO, BUT FOR THE ALAMEDA COUNTY TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION, THANK YOU, HANS, FOR ALSO REPRESENTING US ON THE 
19:41:10 CITY SIDE.
WE WERE ABLE TO ADOPT SOME OF THE BUDGET ITEMS, AND IF YOU'D LIKE TO SEE 
19:41:17 SOME OF THOSE SPECIFIC PROJECTS THAT PERTAIN TO FREMONT AND SOME OF THE USAGE OF IT, INCLUDING HOW THEY'RE 
19:41:19 ACCOUNTING FOR THE FINANCES FOR THOSE, THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT.

19:41:24 I THINK THAT CLARIFIES SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT PEOPLE MAY HAVE ON CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROGRAMS, 
19:41:31 INCLUDING FOR SOME OF THE DIRECT FUNDING TO MUNICIPALITIES AND HOW ACTUALLY WHEN I WAS LISTENING TO THE 
19:41:36 PROJECT AND I WANTED TO SHARE THAT PRESENTATION, I'LL POST THAT TOO, THAT 15% IS ACTUALLY REQUIRED TO BE 
19:41:43 ALLOCATED SPECIFICALLY TO BIKE AND MASTER PLAN -- PEDESTRIAN PLANS.
SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S IMPORTANT 
19:41:49 FOR PEOPLE TO NOTE, THAT IT'S NOT FROM OUR GENERAL FUNDS BUT IT'S PART OF THE OTHER CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROGRAMS 
19:41:57 THAT ARE DESIGNATED BY THE STATE AND COUNTY AND THAT ARE ALSO ALREADY ALLOCATED TO CERTAIN PROCESSES AND 
19:42:04 PERFORMANCES.
SO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT.
NEXT ON OUR AGENDA ITEM IS THE 
19:42:14 PROPOSED REFUNDING OF THE GENERAL OBLIGATION BONDS, SERIES 2012 -- 2013 AND 2012.

19:42:26 AND I WOULD LIKE TO WELCOME JO MORTENSEN WHO IS THE SENIOR MANAGING DIRECTOR, AND CHRIS LYNCH, THE 
19:42:31 BOND/DISCLOSURE COUNSEL, FOR ANY AVAILABLE QUESTIONS, AND I ALSO SEE DIRECTOR PERSSELIN.

19:42:38 THANK YOU.
ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE COUNCILMEMBERS?

19:42:48 SEEING NONE, I'D LIKE TO OPEN IT FOR QUESTIONS FROM THE PUBLIC COMMENT.
AND I DON'T SEE ANY THERE.

19:42:55 SO COULD I GET ANY OTHER MOTION FROM THE COUNCIL -- THE PUBLIC COMMENT'S CLOSED.

19:43:02 I SEE COUNCILMEMBER JONES AND COUNCILMEMBER COX.
SO MOTION BY COUNCILMEMBER JONES AND 
19:43:08 SECONDED BY COUNCILMEMBER COX, TO THE PROPOSED REFUNDING OF THE GENERAL OBLIGATION BONDS.

19:43:13 ROLL CALL VOTE, PLEASE.
>> Ms. Gauthier: COUNCILMEMBER COX, AYE.

19:43:20 COUNCILMEMBER SALWAN, AYE.
COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, AYE.
COUNCILMEMBER JONES, AYE.

19:43:28 COUNCILMEMBER KENG, AYE.
VICE MAYOR SHAO, AYE.
MAYOR MEI, AYE.

19:43:35 >> Mayor Mei: SO THIS PASSES UNANIMOUSLY.
THANK YOU FOR ALL THAT PARTICIPATED IN 
19:43:42 THIS ITEM THIS EVENING.
NEXT ON OUR AGENDA IS ANY COUNCIL ORAL REPORTS FROM MEETINGS THAT YOU HAVE 
19:43:51 ATTENDED.
I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S ANY THAT WANT TO SHARE ANY COMMITTEE REPORTS THAT 
19:43:55 THEY'VE ATTENDED.
OKAY.
COUNCILMEMBER -- VICE MAYOR SHAO, I 
19:44:02 BELIEVE YOU HAD A MEETING.
>> Vice Mayor Shao: YES.
I JUST ATTENDED MONTHLY ALAMEDA COUNTY 
19:44:14 HOUSING AUTHORITY  MEETING, AND I WAS EXCITED TO LEARN THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PROVIDED -- THE HACA WAS 
19:44:25 250 EMERGENCY HOUSING VOUCHERS, AND THOSE VOUCHERS ARE GOING TO BE DISTRIBUTED AMONG ALL THE CITIES IN 
19:44:39 ALAMEDA COUNTY THROUGH THE AGENCY OF COC, SHORT FOR CONTINUUM OF CARE.
I'M VERY GLAD TO LEARN THAT OUR HUMAN 
19:44:53 SERVICES DEPARTMENT WORKS WITH THE COC TO HELP HOUSE THE HOMELESS, THE ABOUT TO BE  HOMELESS, AS WELL AS VICTIMS OF 
19:45:06 DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, AMONG OTHER NEEDY PEOPLE, AND I EXPECT THAT SOME OF THOSE EMERGENCY HOUSING VOUCHERS WOULD 
19:45:14 COME TO FREMONT TO HELP THE LOCAL PEOPLE.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU FOR SHARING 
19:45:18 THAT UPDATE.
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT I HAD HEARD ALREADY DURING OUR ALAMEDA COUNTY 
19:45:25 MAYORS' CONFERENCE, WE HAD TALKED ABOUT IN OUR  HOMELESSNESS WORKING GROUP, SO I WAS FAMILIAR WITH THAT, SO I THOUGHT 
19:45:29 YOU'D SHARE THAT THIS EVENING BECAUSE IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT, THE BEST WAY TO KEEP US FROM 
19:45:34 ADDRESSING HOMELESSNESS IS TO PREVENT IT, AND SO THEREFORE, THAT'S A GREAT EFFORT AND I APPRECIATE YOU SHARING 
19:45:40 THAT.
ARE THERE ANY OTHER THINGS TO SHARE?
THE ONLY ITEMS THAT I ALSO WOULD SHARE 
19:45:47 IS, AGAIN, WHEN IT COMES TO THE TRANSPORTATION, THAT THERE ARE A LIST OF PROJECTS THAT WERE UPDATED IN TERMS 
19:45:54 OF THE FUNDING THAT WAS ALLOCATED BY EACH MUNICIPALITY.
I APPRECIATED FOR THE ALAMEDA COUNTY 
19:45:58 TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION THAT THEY ADDRESSED NOT JUST THE FUNDS THAT WERE GIVEN TO EACH MUNICIPALITY BUT ALSO 
19:46:05 THE FUNDS THAT WERE REIMBURSED AND MORE IMPORTANTLY FOR BETTER  ACCOUNTING PURPOSES, THEY ENTERTAINED MY REQUEST 
19:46:12 WHICH WAS TO ADD THE COLUMN THAT SHOWED AMOUNT OF FUNDING THAT'S ENCUMBERED, BECAUSE NORMALLY THEY DON'T SHOW IT 
19:46:17 UNLESS IT'S ACTUALLY BEEN SPENT, BUT ENCUMBERED IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT MEANS WE'VE ALREADY ALLOCATED TO 
19:46:23 PROJECTS HERE IN THE CITY.
OTHER THAN THAT, ALSO I ALSO WANT TO SHARE THAT IN THIS TIME PERIOD, WE'VE 
19:46:29 TALKED ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF KEEPING FREMONT HOUSED, AND THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE AVAILABLE THROUGH OUR HUMAN 
19:46:34 SERVICES DEPARTMENT, BUT ALSO EQUALLY IMPORTANT IS THAT THERE'S SOME PROGRAMS THAT ARE BEING OFFERED BY 
19:46:41 EAST BAY COMMUNITY ENERGY, AS WELL AS OTHERS SUCH AS THE KEEP FREMONT HOUSED THAT ADDRESS UTILITIES AND THE NEED 
19:46:49 FOR SOME PEOPLE TO PAY THEIR BACK DUE UTILITIES AND SO THOSE ARE PROGRAMS I HOPE PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE 
19:46:57 OF, AS WELL AS WHEN WE TALKED EARLIER THIS EVENING, THERE WAS A SPEAKER WHO TALKED ABOUT RAIL AND THE ASPECTS OF 
19:47:08 ACCESS TO IT AND THE IMPORTANCE OF PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION, AND THAT ACE CORRIDOR ALSO HAS SOME DISCOUNTED 
19:47:14 FARES SPECIFICALLY FOR THOSE FACING ECONOMIC CHALLENGES AND THEY'RE ABLE TO USE THOSE FARE REDUCTIONS AND 
19:47:19 PROGRAMS AND WE'LL MAKE SURE THOSE ARE PUBLISHED THROUGH OUR FREMONT FAMILY RESOURCE CENTER, WHICH IS CRITICAL FOR 
19:47:27 THIS TIME PERIOD, AND SO WE JUST WANT TO THANK ALL FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY.
I ALSO WANTED TO WELCOME  EVERYONE TO 
19:47:35 THE YELLOW TIER, AND THAT WE'LL HOPEFULLY BE ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD SAFELY, THAT WE WILL BE LOOKING AT HOW 
19:47:45 WE CAN RE-OPEN AND PROVIDE SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS FOR OUR  COMMUNITY, AND I KNOW THE CITY STAFF IS LOOKING AT 
19:47:55 HOW WE CAN ALSO SLOWLY WORK ON ADDRESSING THE RE-OPENING OF OUR CITY OFFICES AND FACILITIES.

19:48:02 I DIDN'T KNOW, CITY MANAGER DANAJ, IF YOU COMMENTED ON THAT SO PEOPLE CAN UNDERSTAND WHERE WE'RE AT.

19:48:06 >> City Manager Danaj: THERE ARE PROGRAMS UNDERWAY TO ALREADY STAFF CERTAIN PROGRAMS THAT HAVE BEEN 
19:48:14 APPROVED FOR USE.
WE ALSO HAVE PROGRAMS UNDERWAY TO OPEN UP CITY HALL IN A MODIFIED FASHION, 
19:48:23 AND ALSO PROGRAMS TO BRING THE CITY COUNCIL BACK TO HYBRID OR POTENTIALLY COMPLETE IN-PERSON MEETINGS STARTING 
19:48:29 AFTER YOUR SUMMER RECESS.
AND ALL OF THAT TO BE ON THE CITY'S WEBSITE.

19:48:34 >> Mayor Mei: YES.
SO THANK YOU FOR THOSE QUESTIONS THAT WERE ANSWERED, AS WELL AS WE'RE GOING 
19:48:38 TO BE PUBLICIZING THAT MORE IN OUR REGULAR NEWSLETTERS AND ON THE WEBSITE.

19:48:44 AND SEEING THAT THAT WAS THE LAST AGENDA ITEM, I'D LIKE TO CALL THE MEETING ADJOURNED THIS EVENING AND 
19:48:51 THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR HELP AND COOPERATION DURING THIS PERIOD, AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO BE ABLE TO SEEING MORE 
19:48:57 OF YOU IN PERSON AND TO DO SO AND KEEP EVERYONE SAFE AND HEALTHY.
IF YOU DO NEED SERVICES, WE DO STILL 
19:49:03 HAVE TESTING AVAILABLE, AND THAT WE ALSO HAVE RESOURCES FOR VACCINATION, AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO KEEPING 
19:49:07 EVERYONE HEALTHY AND WELL AS WE MOVE FORWARD.
WITH THAT, I'D LIKE TO ADJOURN THE
