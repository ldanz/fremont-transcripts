[Captioner] 19:28:46

[Captioner] 19:28:55
 COMES TO EDUCATION, IF YOU'RE SURROUNDED BY THE SPIRITS, THAT YOU LEARN

[Captioner] 19:28:59
 BETTER, WHICH IS IF YOU'VE NEVER HAD THE OPPORTUNITY, THERE IS A NATIVE AMERICAN

[Captioner] 19:29:03
 STUDIES TUTORING CENTER AS WELL AS MUSEUM THERE, BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE STRONGLY THAT

[Captioner] 19:29:07

[Captioner] 19:29:51
 THE CHIEF OF POLICE, SEAN WASHINGTON, BY POST LAW ENFORCEMENT

[Captioner] 19:29:56
 CONSULTANT, AND GARY CLARK, IF YOU COULD COME AND PLEASE JOIN ME.
THIS IS A PRIVILEGE AND

[Captioner] 19:30:00
 WE ARE VERY EXCITED TO SEE THIS PRESENTATION TO OUR CHIEF OF POLICE, SEAN

[Captioner] 19:30:02
 WASHINGTON THIS EVENING.
SO IF YOU'D LIKE TO SHARE THAT.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:30:09
>> MY NAME IS GARY CLARK.
I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA,

[Captioner] 19:30:13
 THE GOVERNOR, GAVIN NEWSOM, AND PEACE OFFICER STANDARDS AND TRAINING OUT OF

[Captioner] 19:30:18
 SACRAMENTO, I'M HERE TO PRESENT CHIEF WASHINGTON WITH THIS PRESTIGIOUS AWARD.


[Captioner] 19:30:22
HIS EXECUTIVE CERTIFICATE, WHICH IS NOT AN EASY CERTIFICATE TO GET.
WE

[Captioner] 19:30:27
 HAVE OVER 600 AGENCIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA, AND WE ONLY HAVE

[Captioner] 19:30:31
 GIVEN OUT 44 OF THESE AWARDS.
TO GET THIS AWARD, HE HAS TO GO TO --

[Captioner] 19:30:35
 WELL, HE HAS TO GET HIS BASIC CERTIFICATE, INTERMEDIATE,

[Captioner] 19:30:39
 ADVANCED, 60-SEMESTER COLLEGE UNITS, A DEGREE, THEN HE HAS TO GO TO SUPERVISOR

[Captioner] 19:30:44
 SCHOOL, MANAGER SCHOOL, AND THEN THIS SCHOOL HERE.
A LOT OF PEOPLE APPLY FOR

[Captioner] 19:30:48
 THIS POSITION, A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T GET THIS.
SO WE DON'T TAKE

[Captioner] 19:30:52
 THIS VERY LIGHTLY, AND IT'S A VERY PRESTIGIOUS HONOR, WHICH IS WHY I'M

[Captioner] 19:30:56
 HERE, AND I'D LIKE TO PRESENT THIS TO CHIEF

[Captioner] 19:31:00
 SEAN WASHINGTON ON BEHALF OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND GOVERNOR GAVIN NEWSOM.


[Captioner] 19:31:05
CONGRATULATIONS.
[APPLAUSE]


[Captioner] 19:31:15
>> Mayor Mei: I'M GOING TO ASK A POINT OF PRIVILEGE.
I KNOW HE WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO DO THIS 

[Captioner] 19:31:19
WITHOUT THE SUPPORT OF HIS FAMILY, SO I'D LIKE TO

[Captioner] 19:31:23
 ASK IF THE CHIEF WOULD LIKE TO INVITE HIS WIFE AND DAUGHTER

[Captioner] 19:31:26
 TO COME JOIN.
TRULY IT IS A FAMILY TO BE ABLE TO GET ANYTHING DONE.


[Captioner] 19:31:30
SO PLEASE.
[APPLAUSE]


[Captioner] 19:31:35
>> IT'S A BIG DEAL.


[Captioner] 19:32:09
>> SO I WILL KEEP IT VERY BRIEF BECAUSE MY

[Captioner] 19:32:13
 STAFF WILL START TO HIT THE "WRAP IT

[Captioner] 19:32:17
 UP" SIGN AS WELL AS MY WIFE.
SHE SAYS I TALK TOO LONG.
BUT THIS

[Captioner] 19:32:21
 IS HUMBLING FOR ME.
ANYONE WHO KNOWS ME KNOWS THAT, YOU KNOW, THIS TYPE

[Captioner] 19:32:25
 OF RECOGNITION IS DIFFICULT, BECAUSE IT'S NOT ABOUT ME.


[Captioner] 19:32:30
IT'S NEVER GOING TO BE ABOUT ME.
YOU

[Captioner] 19:32:34
 KNOW, I'M ONLY ABLE TO BE HERE TODAY BECAUSE OF OUR COMMUNITY.


[Captioner] 19:32:38
SO YES, THIS RECOGNITION HAS MY NAME ON IT.
BUT IT

[Captioner] 19:32:43
 REALLY SHOULD HAVE OVER 240,000 COMMUNITY MEMBERS'

[Captioner] 19:32:47
 NAMES RIGHT BEHIND IT.
AS WELL

[Captioner] 19:32:51
 AS POST, I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU.
I KNOW YOU TRAVELED A LONG WAY TO BE HERE, AND IT

[Captioner] 19:32:55
 DOES MEAN A LOT TO ME THAT YOU TOOK THE TIME OUT TO

[Captioner] 19:32:59
 RECOGNIZE THIS ACCOMPLISHMENT.
AND THEN TO THE CITY MANAGER FOR

[Captioner] 19:33:03
 HAVING FAITH IN ME TO BE THE POLICE CHIEF HERE, THAT'S

[Captioner] 19:33:08
 IMPORTANT.
AS WELL AS ALL MY PARTNERS IN THE CLT, THE

[Captioner] 19:33:13
 CITY LEADERSHIP TEAM.
I THINK THE FIRE CHIEF IS STILL

[Captioner] 19:33:17
 HERE, AND YOU KNOW, THAT'S MY PARTNER AND ALL THE FIREFIGHTERS, I APPRECIATE YOU

[Captioner] 19:33:21
 ALL FOR BEING HERE AS WELL.
TO ALL THE

[Captioner] 19:33:26
 RETIRED PARTNERS OVER THE YEARS THAT HAVE COME OUT, SO I APPRECIATE YOU AS

[Captioner] 19:33:32
 WELL.
AND THEN MY STAFF.


[Captioner] 19:33:36
THEY'RE HERE, THEY CAME OUT TO BE A PART OF THIS, AND IT MEANS A LOT.
YOU

[Captioner] 19:33:41
 GUYS DIDN'T HAVE TO BE HERE, IN FACT, I'M PRETTY SURE I ORDERED YOU NOT

[Captioner] 19:33:45
 TO BE HERE, BUT YOU DID IT ANYWAY, AND THAT MEANS A LOT.
AND

[Captioner] 19:33:49
 THEN LIKE THE MAYOR SAID, JUST MY FAMILY, THANK YOU, YOU

[Captioner] 19:33:53
 KNOW, YOU ALL ALLOW ME TO BE THE CHIEF OF POLICE HERE BECAUSE OF

[Captioner] 19:33:57
 YOUR SACRIFICE AS WELL, SO I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO ALL OF YOU, AND I'M HUMBLED

[Captioner] 19:33:59
 BY THIS HONOR.
THANK YOU.

AND THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR, AGAIN, FOR YOU

[Captioner] 19:35:09

SO WITH THAT, IF OUR CITY CLERK COULD

[Captioner] 19:36:03
 CALL THE FIRST SPEAKER.

[Captioner] 19:36:33
HONORABLE MAYOR, CITY COUNCIL, LET'S SAY IT'S A SATURDAY EVENING AND YOU'RE LOOKING TO CELEBRATE

[Captioner] 19:36:38
 A BIRTHDAY OR AN ANNIVERSARY OR, YOU KNOW, THE KIDS JUST

[Captioner] 19:36:42
 HAD A GOOD WEEK.
CHANCES ARE THAT YOU MIGHT FIND A NICE RESTAURANT

[Captioner] 19:36:46
 IN PALO ALTO, SUNNYVALE, BURLINGAME OR EVEN MILIPITAS.
AS

[Captioner] 19:36:51
 IT TURNS OUT, YOU KNOW, THE CITY OF FREMONT, WHILE IT'S

[Captioner] 19:36:55
 THE HAPPIEST CITY HERE IN OUR COUNTRY, ISN'T QUITE THE

[Captioner] 19:36:59
 HAPPIEST CITY ON A WEEKEND.
I WOULD ASK THAT THE CITY CONSIDER WAYS TO INVEST IN

[Captioner] 19:37:03
 EXPANDING AND ENRICHING THE QUALITY OF LIFE IN FREMONT, AND ATTRACT MULTIFACETED

[Captioner] 19:37:06
 DEVELOPMENT INCLUDING RESTAURANTS, ACCESSIBLE PLAYGROUNDS AND RETAIL SPACES.


[Captioner] 19:37:11
THE ALTERNATIVE TO SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT IS ATROPHY AND

[Captioner] 19:37:15
 DECAY, AND I'M SURE HONORABLE CITY COUNCIL, YOU WILL AGREE THAT

[Captioner] 19:37:20
 WE DO NOT WANT TO BECOME ANOTHER DETROIT, WE DO NOT WANT TO BE JUST

[Captioner] 19:37:24
 ANOTHER BEDROOM CITY SO I WOULD ASK THE CITY WAY FROM

[Captioner] 19:37:27
 A POLICY PERSPECTIVE TO EXPAND INNOVATION INVESTMENTS.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:37:34
>> Mayor Mei: IT'S OKAY.
WE'LL JUST DO

[Captioner] 19:37:38
 ONE, WE'LL KEEP IT CONSISTENT.


[Captioner] 19:37:47

[Captioner] 19:37:53
>> GOOD EVENING.
MY NAME IS BROOK MANTEA,

[Captioner] 19:37:56

[Captioner] 19:38:01
 TO SPEAK.
I'M HERE REPRESENTING IRVINGTON PRESBYTERIAN

[Captioner] 19:38:06
 CHURCH, AND ALSO IN SUPPORT OF MY NEIGHBORS IN

[Captioner] 19:38:10
 IRVINGTON TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF THE RVs PARKED AT OUR

[Captioner] 19:38:14
 INTERSECTION THERE AT IRVINGTON AND CHAPEL

[Captioner] 19:38:19
 WAY, AND I THINK THERE'S BEEN SOME MISCONCEPTIONS THAT THEY'RE

[Captioner] 19:38:23
 PARKED THERE BECAUSE OF OUR BREAKFAST PROGRAM, WHICH IS NOT THE CASE.


[Captioner] 19:38:27
WE SERVE LIKE MAYBE OVER 1500 PEOPLE A

[Captioner] 19:38:32
 MONTH AND NONE OF THEM ARE FROM THOSE

[Captioner] 19:38:36
 RVs.
THE PEOPLE THAT LIVE IN THOSE RVs, THEY DO NOT

[Captioner] 19:38:40
 PARTICIPATE IN THE CHURCH, THEY DON'T ATTEND SERVICES, YOU KNOW,

[Captioner] 19:38:44
 IT'S LIKE, WE'VE SUFFERED VANDALISM, WE'VE

[Captioner] 19:38:49
 HAD OUR CHURCH PEOPLE HARASSED AND ATTACKED.


[Captioner] 19:38:55
SO THAT'S WHAT I NEED TO SAY.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:38:59
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
>> Ms. Gauthier: THE NEXT SPEAKER IS CHARU FOLLOWED BY

[Captioner] 19:39:05
 MONJAT AND FOLLOWED BY ROSE.
>> GOOD

[Captioner] 19:39:10
 EVENING.
AS MUCH AS YOU KNOW ABOUT THE HOMELESSNESS

[Captioner] 19:39:15
 ISSUES, HAS BEEN VERY CONCERNING THAT ALL THE NEIGHBORS HAVE

[Captioner] 19:39:19
 BEEN TERRORIZED BY THESE PEOPLE.
I MYSELF HAD MY HOUSE ATTACKED BY SOMEONE WITH

[Captioner] 19:39:24
 A MACHETE.
THEY HAVE TRIED GETTING INTO OUR HOUSE BY JUMPING THE

[Captioner] 19:39:28
 BACKYARD FENCE.
WE HAD TO SPEND THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS ON, YOU KNOW, ALARM

[Captioner] 19:39:33
 SYSTEMS, SECURITY SYSTEMS, OUTDOOR CAMERAS, INDOOR CAMERAS, EXTRA FENCES,

[Captioner] 19:39:37
 AND THIS IS A CONSTANT CONCERN ANYWHERE NEAR

[Captioner] 19:39:42
 BAY STREET, THE ENTIRE IRVINGTON SPACE IS JUST FILLED WITH

[Captioner] 19:39:47
 PEOPLE AS MUCH AS I EMPATHIZE WITH THEIR STRUGGLES, I ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE

[Captioner] 19:39:51
 SECURITY OF THE FREMONT RESIDENTS ARE NOT OVERLOOKED AND I REALLY HOPE THAT WE COULD

[Captioner] 19:39:55
 MAKE SOME MOVES BEFORE IT BECOMES TOO LATE AN SOMEBODY HAS TO GET HURT.


[Captioner] 19:39:59
I'M ALREADY SURE THAT THEY NEED SOME HELP, I HOPE THEY GET THEIR HELP BUT WE ALSO WANT

[Captioner] 19:40:02
 TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE SAFE AND OUR MENTAL HEALTH IS ALSO TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION.


[Captioner] 19:40:07
SO THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SAY.
PLEASE, LET'S ESCALATE THIS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.


[Captioner] 19:40:11
THANK YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:40:18
>> HELLO, GOOD EVENING.
WE ARE IN

[Captioner] 19:40:23
 FALL, AND EVERYONE KNOWS THAT NEXT FALL IS THE ELECTION, AND

[Captioner] 19:40:27
 HOW SERIOUS IS THE HOMELESSNESS PROBLEM HERE IN IRVINGTON AREA

[Captioner] 19:40:31
 AND THE KIDS' LIVES ARE AT RISK AND WHAT ALL THEY SEE WHEN THEY WALK TO THE

[Captioner] 19:40:34
 SCHOOL.
SO NOW, HOW DID WE COME TO THIS PROBLEM?


[Captioner] 19:40:38
WE DIDN'T HAVE THIS PROBLEM OF HOMELESS ENCAMPMENT AT THAT SITE.


[Captioner] 19:40:43
AND IT IS BECAUSE ON

[Captioner] 19:40:47
 SEPTEMBER 10TH, 2019, YOU GUYS VOTED YES, I CAN TELL THE NAME OF THE

[Captioner] 19:40:51
 PEOPLE WHO VOTED YES, THE COUNCILMEMBER, AND THEN THAT IS NOT ENOUGH FOR YOU GUYS,

[Captioner] 19:40:56
 AND YOU ALLOWED SAFE PARKING WHICH OPENED THE FLOODGATE FOR ALL THE

[Captioner] 19:41:00
 RVs FROM THE U.S. TO COME HERE FROM THE FREMONT.
I HAVE THE NAMES OF THE PEOPLE WHO 

[Captioner] 19:41:04
VOTED YES FOR THIS, SO YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR CREATING THIS MESS IN FREMONT AND YOU CALL IT AS A

[Captioner] 19:41:09
 BEST CITY.
AND YOU

[Captioner] 19:41:13
 GUYS LIVE IN A GATED COMMUNITY OR A SAFE AREA.
THAT'S YOUR MARTHA'S

[Captioner] 19:41:17
 VINEYARD.
BUT WE LIVE

[Captioner] 19:41:21
 ON THIS STREET AND WE HAVE TO FACE HOMELESS.
>> Ms. Gauthier: THE NEXT SPEAKER

[Captioner] 19:41:25

[Captioner] 19:41:29
 UG.
>> GOOD EVENING.
I'M HERE TO TALK ABOUT, YOU KNOW, NOT 

[Captioner] 19:41:33
TALK ABOUT, I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS ACTUALLY.
WHAT ARE WE DOING ABOUT THE

[Captioner] 19:41:37
 SAFETY AND SECURITY OF THE KIDS IN OUR COMMUNITY?
AND HOW ARE

[Captioner] 19:41:41
 WE OKAY IN COMPROMISING THEIR SAFETY AND SECURITY?
THERE ARE

[Captioner] 19:41:45
 THOUSANDS OF CHILDREN WHICH INCLUDES MY CHILD AS WELL WHO WALKS EVERY DAY ON

[Captioner] 19:41:50
 THIS ROAD TO SCHOOL AND I AM SO SCARED AS A MOTHER, I'M ANXIOUS

[Captioner] 19:41:54
 ALL THE TIME, I HAVE GIVEN UP MY FULL-TIME JOB JUST TO TRACK

[Captioner] 19:41:58
 HIM SO THAT HE REACHES IN SCHOOL SAFELY.
SO I

[Captioner] 19:42:02
 REALLY HAVE A QUESTION, WHAT ARE WE DOING ABOUT IT, AND HOW LONG DO WE

[Captioner] 19:42:06
 HAVE TO WAIT IN THIS ANXIETY?
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:42:16
>> Ms. Gauthier: MONA FOLLOWED BY U.G. FOLLOWED BY VENUS.

[Captioner] 19:42:28
 SCHOOL GOING STUDENTS IN IRVINGTON, IRVINGTON

[Captioner] 19:42:33
 SCHOOLS.
THREE

[Captioner] 19:42:37
 SCHOOLS INCREASED HOMELESS RVs AND CARS HAVE

[Captioner] 19:42:42
 INCREASED ANXIETY AND STRESS ON STUDENTS AND PARENTS AS

[Captioner] 19:42:47
 WELL, STUDENTS IN IRVINGTON AREA ARE AFRAID OF PASSING BY LINED UP HOMELESS

[Captioner] 19:42:52
 RVs AND CARS, MAKING IT HARD FOR STUDENTS AND PARENTS TO WALK OR BIKE TO SCHOOL.


[Captioner] 19:42:56
IT'S IMPACTING SAFETY AND MENTAL HEALTH OF OUR CHILDREN.
RVs

[Captioner] 19:43:00
 BLOCKING SIDEWALKS AND INCREASING HIGHLY CHANCES OF ACCIDENTS.
TRASH ON SIDEWALKS

[Captioner] 19:43:05
 IMPACTING HEALTH OF OUR CHILDREN AND MAKING IRVINGTON SCHOOL ZONE

[Captioner] 19:43:09
 UNHYGIENIC.
IT'S BECOME A VERY NORMAL PHENOMENON TO CHASE A CHILD

[Captioner] 19:43:13
 AND -- WHILE WALKING TO THEIR SCHOOL.
SO I WILL REQUEST HERE TO MAKE A

[Captioner] 19:43:17
 PERMANENT SOLUTION AND KEEP IRVINGTON CLEAN AND SAFE FOR OUR CHILDREN, PARENTS AND NEIGHBORS.


[Captioner] 19:43:22
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:43:31
>> EVERY PERSON HERE IS AWARE OF THE NUMBER OF ASSAULTS

[Captioner] 19:43:36
 HOMELESS PEOPLE HAVE BEEN HAPPENING IN THE PAST TWO OR THREE YEARS BUT ALSO THE

[Captioner] 19:43:40
 DAYLIGHT SEXUAL ABUSE ON AN ELDERLY LADY IN FRONT OF IRVINGTON HIGH SCHOOL THAT SENT

[Captioner] 19:43:45
 CHILLS THROUGH THE SPINE OF EVERY IRVINGTON RESIDENT.
I WISH TO THIS COUNCIL TO

[Captioner] 19:43:49
 GET A COUNT OF THE NUMBER OF CALLS MADE BY THE IRVINGTON RESIDENTS

[Captioner] 19:43:51
 REGARDING RSM Vs AND CARS PARKED IN FRONT OF THEIR HOMES.
ONE OF THEM IS ME.


[Captioner] 19:43:57
ONE RV PARKED OUTSIDE MY HOME FOR OVER A YEAR WHEN

[Captioner] 19:44:01
 APPROACHED BY THE FREMONT POLICE MOVED BUT ONLY AFTER COMING TO MY DOOR AND

[Captioner] 19:44:05
 THREATENING ME THAT HE'S A RETIRED VA AND HAS A GUN.
ANOTHER

[Captioner] 19:44:09
 JUMPING MY FENCE TO USE WATER AND YET ANOTHER HOMELESS WITH MENTAL HEALTH

[Captioner] 19:44:13
 ISSUES TRESPASSING MY PROPERTY IN DAYLIGHT WITH ME ON THE PORCH WITH A MA

[Captioner] 19:44:17
 MACHETE AND THREATENING.
NOTHING CAN BE DONE

[Captioner] 19:44:22
 OBVIOUSLY UNTIL MY STOMACH OR THROAT IS SLIT.
I WOULD REQUEST THE COUNCIL TO GO AND 

[Captioner] 19:44:26
CAMP THERE AND STAY THERE AND FEEL WHAT WE FEEL EVERY DAY.
AND TO GO AND WITNESS WHAT

[Captioner] 19:44:31
 A CHILD SEES EVERY DAY AFTER SCHOOL.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:44:42
>> TODAY I WANT TO BRING THE CHALLENGES WE ARE FACING NEAR THE

[Captioner] 19:44:46
 IRVINGTON CHAPEL WAY AND THIS NEEDS ATTENTION FOR A

[Captioner] 19:44:50
 BRIGHTER FUTURE OF OUR KIDS, CITY AND COMMUNITY.
PICTURE THIS DURING THE SCHOOL

 PEAK TIMES DROPOFF PICKUP LUNCH TIMES IT'S LIKE A TRAFFIC PARTY AND IT'S

[Captioner] 19:45:00
 NOT -- THERE IS HEALTH ISSUES, SMOKE COMING FROM RVs, ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES,

[Captioner] 19:45:04
 MEN AND WOMEN COMING OUT FROM THE SAME CAR, EXHAUST FUMES, THINGS WE SHOULDN'T HAVE TO DEAL WITH.


[Captioner] 19:45:09
AND THAT'S NOT IT, LET'S TALK ABOUT THE BIG ELEPHANT IN THE

[Captioner] 19:45:13
 ROOM.
 -- NATURE OF SOME OF THESE PEOPLE, INCLUDING

[Captioner] 19:45:18
 A POTENTIAL CATALYST FOR GUN VIOLENCE.
IT'S HARSH REALITY, BUT WE CANNOT

[Captioner] 19:45:22
 IGNORE IT.
IT'S NOT SAFE FOR OUR COMMUNITY, CAN WE

[Captioner] 19:45:26
 FIND A SOLUTION TOGETHER AND SHARING PROSPERITY AND WELL-BEING OF FREMONT?
THANKS.


[Captioner] 19:45:33
>> Ms. Gauthier: SHEILA.


[Captioner] 19:45:37
>> HELLO, EVERYONE.
TODAY I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT HOW THE LAW

[Captioner] 19:45:41
 INFRINGEMENT IS HAPPENING BY THE RVs AND CARS THAT ARE PARKED ON THE CHAPEL WAY AND

[Captioner] 19:45:46
 THE IRVINGTON AVENUE.
SOME OF THESE

[Captioner] 19:45:50
 RVs HAVE BEEN STANDING THERE FOR SO MANY MONTHS, AND SOME OF

[Captioner] 19:45:54
 THEM ARE NOT EVEN HAVING THE LICENSE AND

[Captioner] 19:45:58
 THEY ARE EITHER ABANDONED OR NOT MOVED FOR MANY

[Captioner] 19:46:03
 MONTHS.
THE ROAD STINKS WITH URINE SMELL, AND TRASH AROUND THEM.


[Captioner] 19:46:09
HOMELESS PEOPLE SLEEP ON THE SIDEWALKS WHERE THE KIDS WALK. TO

[Captioner] 19:46:13
 SCHOOL AND BACK TO SCHOOL -- BACK TO HOME.
LAST MONTH WE PUT

[Captioner] 19:46:18
 IN A PETITION ABOUT THIS, AND WE HAVE

[Captioner] 19:46:22
 RECEIVED ABOUT THOUSAND SIGNATURES ALREADY.
THIS SHOWS

[Captioner] 19:46:26
 THE AGENCY AND THE SEVERITY OF THE PROBLEM WE ARE

[Captioner] 19:46:31
 FACING.
I REQUEST THE CITY TO

[Captioner] 19:46:36
 EITHER MAKE BOTH OF THE ROADS INTO

[Captioner] 19:46:40
 BIKE LANES SO THE KIDS CAN BIKE TO SCHOOL.
>> Ms.

[Captioner] 19:46:45
 Gauthier: BETTY WEST.
THEN I HAVE A CARD WITH NO NAME ON IT,

[Captioner] 19:46:49
 IT JUST SAYS MAHONEY STREET, FREMONT.


[Captioner] 19:46:53
BETTY?
>> I MOVED INTO MY HOUSE IN 1961.
I

[Captioner] 19:46:57
 LIVE DOWN THE STREET FROM IRVINGTON PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH.
SO

[Captioner] 19:47:01
 OBVIOUSLY I'VE SEEN A LOT OF CHANGES.
MY CHILDREN DIDN'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH WHAT THESE

[Captioner] 19:47:06
 YOUNGSTERS ARE GOING THROUGH NOW.
I AM HERE TO JUST SUPPORT THEM IN THEIR

[Captioner] 19:47:10
 CRIES FOR HELP, AND ALSO TO AS A SENIOR CITIZEN, I HAVE TO TELL

[Captioner] 19:47:14
 YOU, I AM NO LONGER FEELING SAFE TO WALK TO THE GROCERY STORE OR

[Captioner] 19:47:19
 TO THE POST OFFICE WHICH ARE NEARBY.
I GO TO THE

[Captioner] 19:47:23
 LAKE WHERE THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE,

[Captioner] 19:47:27
 AND FRIENDS TO WALK WITH.
SO I'M JUST HERE TO SUPPORT MY NEIGHBORS.


[Captioner] 19:47:36
>> MY NAME IS NOT THERE, SO MY NAME IS KK.
AND

[Captioner] 19:47:41
 GOOD EVENING, EVERYONE.
SO I'M HERE FOR THE SAFETY OF

[Captioner] 19:47:45
 THE KIDS AROUND IRVINGTON.
THIS IS

[Captioner] 19:47:49
 THE PROBLEM KNOWN BY CITY BUT IT HAS NOT BEEN TAKEN CARE.


[Captioner] 19:47:53
AND I HEARD THAT THEY INVITE HOMELESS PEOPLE FROM

[Captioner] 19:47:58
 OTHER CITIES AND GETTING MONEY, BUT WHERE THOSE MONEYS

[Captioner] 19:48:02
 ARE GOING AWAY, WHERE THOSE MONEYS ARE SPENDING?
ARE YOU

[Captioner] 19:48:06
 GUYS DOING SOME SHELTER FOR HOMELESSNESS?


[Captioner] 19:48:11
HOMELESSNESS IS NOT A CRIME, BUT IT'S NOT GOOD FOR OUR KIDS WHO ARE PASSING BY

[Captioner] 19:48:15
 FOR THE SCHOOL,

[Captioner] 19:48:19
 AND ALL THE HOMELESS PEOPLE HAVE DOGS AND THEY ARE UNLEASHED,

[Captioner] 19:48:25
 THESE ARE SOME THREATS ON THE KIDS WHO'S GOING TO SCHOOL IN

[Captioner] 19:48:29
 THOSE IRVINGTON AREAS.
SO SAFETY OF KIDS, PLEASE ACT

[Captioner] 19:48:30
 FAST.
THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SAY.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:48:37

[Captioner] 19:49:12

[Captioner] 19:49:16
S.
BASICALLY I'LL BE REPEATING AGAIN WHAT MOST OF OUR NEIGHBORS

[Captioner] 19:49:20
 HAVE BEEN MENTIONING OVER THE LAST FEW MINUTES.


[Captioner] 19:49:24
SO BASICALLY THIS HAS KIND OF BECOME A NUISANCE FOR

[Captioner] 19:49:28
 US.
I'VE BEEN A FREMONT RES DENSE

[Captioner] 19:49:32
 FOR THE PAST 30-PLUS YEARS BUT NEVER SEEN IT THAT BAD.
RECENTLY ALL

[Captioner] 19:49:36
 THESE ACTIVITIES THAT ARE GOING

[Captioner] 19:49:42
 ON.
WE ELECTED THE CITY MEMBERS AND I THINK YOU

[Captioner] 19:49:46
 GUYS SHOULD TAKE UP LEADERSHIP IN TERMS OF TAKING

[Captioner] 19:49:51
 SOME ACTION AS

[Captioner] 19:49:55
 TO WHERE YOU WANT TO RELOCATE THESE HOMELESS PEOPLE SO WE HAVE A

[Captioner] 19:49:57
 SAFER PLACE FOR OURSELVES AND OUR CHILDREN.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:50:06
>> Ms. Gauthier: THANK YOU.
BARBARA SMITH FOLLOWED BY PERLIN.


[Captioner] 19:50:10
>> GOOD EVENING.
I HAVE LIVED HERE FOR 23 YEARS.


[Captioner] 19:50:14
I'VE NOT SEEN THE HOMELESS GET

[Captioner] 19:50:18
 SO MUCH IN IRVINGTON AREA.
THERE ALWAYS HAS BEEN A FEW RVs

[Captioner] 19:50:23
 BUT NOW WE'VE GOT LINES OF THEM.
I DON'T HAVE CHILDREN SO I'M MORE

[Captioner] 19:50:28
 CONCERNED FOR OTHER PEOPLE HERE THAT DO HAVE CHILDREN AND HAVE

[Captioner] 19:50:32
 TO WALK BY THESE PEOPLE.
I DON'T KNOW THEM.
I

[Captioner] 19:50:36
 DO HAVE EMPATHY FOR THEM AS WELL.
MY OTHER CONCERN IS THAT

[Captioner] 19:50:41
 I UNDERSTAND THAT MACHETE PERSON IS GETTING OUT OF JAIL SOON.


[Captioner] 19:50:46
WHICH RAISES EXTREME STRESS

[Captioner] 19:50:50
 FOR ME, BECAUSE HE'S BEEN IN MY BACKYARD WITH A MACHETE, HE'S BEEN

[Captioner] 19:50:54
 IN MY FRONT YARD WITH A MACHETE.
AND IF HE'S GETTING OUT SOON, I'M

[Captioner] 19:50:58
 VERY, VERY CONCERNED.
SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE WITH THIS PERSON, AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE CAN 

[Captioner] 19:51:02
DO TO HELP HIM, BUT HE NEEDS HELP.
I CAN'T HELP

[Captioner] 19:51:06
 HIM PERSONALLY, BUT I KNOW THAT THE NEIGHBORS ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT HIM BEING RELEASED.


[Captioner] 19:51:11
THANK YOU.
>> Ms. Gauthier: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:51:17
PERLIN?

GOOD EVENING, EVERYONE.


[Captioner] 19:51:22
I'M HERE TO REPRESENT OF

[Captioner] 19:51:26
 COURSE I'M ALSO PART OF THE IRVINGTON NEIGHBORHOOD SO I'M HERE TO TALK ABOUT IT

[Captioner] 19:51:30
 AND I'M DEFINITELY ECHOING EVERYONE OVER HERE IN THIS ROOM.
AND COMING TO THE MAIN

[Captioner] 19:51:35
 TOPIC TO CONCERN HERE IS TO TALK ABOUT THE KIDS' SAFETY WHILE THEY WALK TO SCHOOL.


[Captioner] 19:51:40
HYGIENE ISSUES, TRASH ALL THE WAY, UNSAFE ENVIRONMENT.


[Captioner] 19:51:46
PEOPLE AROUND THE AREA WHO ARE LIVING IN THE

[Captioner] 19:51:50
 RVs AND -- ARE SHOUTING, USING HARSH LANGUAGE, LOUD,

[Captioner] 19:51:54
 AND KIDS ARE REALLY FRIGHTENED, WHICH IS NOT A SAFE ENVIRONMENT FOR A SCHOOL ZONE.


[Captioner] 19:51:59
SO I KINDLY REQUEST EACH AND EVERY ONE OVER HERE TO

[Captioner] 19:52:03
 PLEASE, PLEASE CHECK OUT THIS AS A HIGH PRIORITY AND

[Captioner] 19:52:07
 PLEASE CONSIDER THIS.
THANK YOU.
>> Ms. Gauthier: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:52:12
THE NEXT SPEAKER IS ANKIT FOLLOWED BY

[Captioner] 19:52:16
 SALEEM.


[Captioner] 19:52:23
>> GOOD EVENING, EVERYONE.
I

[Captioner] 19:52:28
 HAVE TWO KIDS GOING TO -- ONE GOING TO HOR

[Captioner] 19:52:31
 SH ELEMENTARY AND ONE TO HORNER, WALKING ALONE TO SCHOOL IS NOT SAFE FOR KIDS.


[Captioner] 19:52:36
THIS AREA IS FULL OF TRASH, PROPANE TANKS

[Captioner] 19:52:40
 LYING AROUND ON THE ROAD, AND TRASH AND UNHYGIENIC CONDITIONS.


[Captioner] 19:52:44
SO DEFINITELY KIDS CANNOT WALK AROUND.
AT LEAST 20 VEHICLES THERE,

[Captioner] 19:52:48
 AND DAY BY DAY, THEY'RE INCREASING.
SO IF THE CITY IS NOT GOING TO TAKE ANY ACTION,

[Captioner] 19:52:53
 THIS WILL BECOME EVEN WORSE.


[Captioner] 19:52:57
THERE ARE -- AS SOMETHING MENTIONED ON CHANGE.ORG THERE'S

[Captioner] 19:53:01
 A PETITION THAT A THOUSAND HAVE SIGNED THE PETITION.
SO I URGE

[Captioner] 19:53:05
 CITY COUNCILMEMBERS TO TAKE SOME ACTION, SOME MEANINGFUL ACTION.
ONE OF

[Captioner] 19:53:10
 THE ACTIONS COULD BE THAT -- HAVE SOME

[Captioner] 19:53:14
 RULE WHERE ANY VEHICLES CANNOT BE PARKED,

[Captioner] 19:53:18
 LIKE HOMELESS VEHICLE, WITHIN 1,000 FEET OF

[Captioner] 19:53:22
 ANY FUSD SCHOOL.
THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.
>> Ms. Gauthier: THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:53:28
SALEEM FOLLOWED BY ADITI.
>> HI, MAYOR AND

[Captioner] 19:53:32
 COUNCILMEMBERS AND THE POLICE DEPARTMENT AND ALL THE DEPARTMENTS.
WE NEED A SOLUTION.


[Captioner] 19:53:38
MANY MONTHS AGO I CAME HERE AND I SAID IRVINGTON, SORRY TO USE THE

[Captioner] 19:53:42
 WORD AGAIN, IS BECOMING A GHETTO.
AND IT IS GETTING WORSE.


[Captioner] 19:53:46
PEOPLE ARE GETTING FRIGHTENED, AFRAID, THEIR KIDS

[Captioner] 19:53:50
 ARE BEING HARASSED, THE CHURCH PEOPLE SAY IT IS

[Captioner] 19:53:54
 NOT US, THE MOSQUE THERE SAYS IT IS NOT US, THE SCHOOL PEOPLE SAY IT

[Captioner] 19:53:59
 IS NOT US.
SO WHY ARE YOU

[Captioner] 19:54:03
 PEOPLE NOT MAKING ARRANGEMENTS FOR THESE PEOPLE TO BE

[Captioner] 19:54:08
 HOUSED?
THERE ARE MANY, MANY PLACES WHERE THESE

[Captioner] 19:54:12
 RVs CAN BE MOVED.
THERE ARE

[Captioner] 19:54:16
 CITY-OWNED PROPERTIES.
TO THAT, I HAVE OFFERED THE CITY A HOTEL PROPERTY

[Captioner] 19:54:21
 WHERE 100 PEOPLE CAN BE HOUSED FREE OF COST, I MET

[Captioner] 19:54:27
 WITH SUZANNE SHENFIL AND IF THE CITY WANTS, I CAN TAKE THE LEAD AND GET THIS THING

[Captioner] 19:54:28
 GOING.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
[APPLAUSE]


[Captioner] 19:54:36
>> Ms. Gauthier: ADITI FOLLOWED BY KIMBERLY ROSE.
>> GOOD EVENING.


[Captioner] 19:54:40
MY NAME IS ADITI AND I'M

[Captioner] 19:54:45
 HERE FROM THE HIRSCH ELEMENTARY SCHOOL PTA.
I JUST WANT TO

[Captioner] 19:54:49
 VOICE MY WORRIES AND CONCERNS ON BEHALF OF A LOT OF OUR

[Captioner] 19:54:53
 HIRSCH ELEMENTARY STUDENTS.
WHILE WE EMPATHIZE WITH OUR NEIGHBORS LIVING IN THE

[Captioner] 19:54:58
 RVs IN IRVINGTON, THE NUMBER OF THEM ON THE STREETS RIGHT NEXT TO

[Captioner] 19:55:02
 THE TWO BIG SCHOOLS, HIRSCH ELEMENTARY AND HORNER, IS VERY WORRYING.


[Captioner] 19:55:07
THE AMOUNT OF TRASH THROWN ALONG THE SIDEWALKS IS JUST UNACCEPTABLE.


[Captioner] 19:55:12
THERE IS GANG GRAFFITI ALL OVER IRVINGTON AND PARENTS ARE NOT ABLE TO

[Captioner] 19:55:16
 SAFELY PARK ON THE STREETS.
I WOULD LIKE TO MENTION QUICKLY THAT WE HAD AN

[Captioner] 19:55:21
 INTERNATIONAL WALK AND ROLL TO SCHOOL MORNING WITH THE

[Captioner] 19:55:25
 PRINCIPAL SCHEDULED AND AT OUR MEETING THIS EVENING POINTED OUT ONLY

[Captioner] 19:55:29
 ABOUT THREE STUDENTS FROM A SCHOOL OF 420 STUDENTS TURNED UP FOR

[Captioner] 19:55:33
 THIS, AND THE REASON PROBABLY WAS BECAUSE FAMILIES ARE AFRAID TO

[Captioner] 19:55:36
 WALK ON THE SIDEWALKS RIGHT NEXT TO HIRSCH AND HORNER.
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:55:46
>> Ms. Gauthier: KIMBERLY ROSE FOLLOWED BY

[Captioner] 19:55:50
 BUNLEY.
>> HI, EVERYONE.
I AM A PARENT AND OFFICER AT

[Captioner] 19:55:54
 BOTH HORNER MIDDLE SCHOOL AND FREMONT COUNCIL PTA, AND I LIVE IN THE SAME NEIGHBORHOOD.


[Captioner] 19:55:59
THERE HAS BEEN POLICE ACTIVITY IN FRONT OF THE SCHOOL, HORNER, MULTIPLE TIMES

[Captioner] 19:56:04
 DURING THE DAY.
THERE WAS SOMEONE SMOKING CRACK ON OUR PORCH WHILE

[Captioner] 19:56:08
 WE WERE HOME ONE BLOCK AWAY FROM THE SCHOOL.
THERE'S HOMELESS SLEEPING

[Captioner] 19:56:13
 IN FRONT -- SLEEPING IN THE STREET IN FRONT OF THE SCHOOLS WITH VARIOUS FLUIDS AND

[Captioner] 19:56:17
 DEBRIS IN THE SIDEWALK.
WHILE FARMERS MARKET, YOU CAN SEE CRACK PIPES,

[Captioner] 19:56:22
 NEEDLES, FECES, AND GARBAGE.
THESE

[Captioner] 19:56:27
 PEOPLE -- THESE ARE PEOPLE AND WE SHOULD BE EMPATHETIC BUT THIS IS NOT APPROPRIATE TO BE AROUND OUR SCHOOL.


[Captioner] 19:56:31
THANK YOU.


[Captioner] 19:56:36
>> GOOD EVENING.


[Captioner] 19:56:40

 ABOUT WAS WALKING AROUND IN MY FRONT YARD WITH

[Captioner] 19:57:02
 THE WEAPON AND WE

[Captioner] 19:57:07
 COULDN'T ENTER OUR HOME ITSELF, WE WERE COMING BACK FROM OUTSIDE.


[Captioner] 19:57:15
BUT -- DRUG USE, MENTAL HEALTH

[Captioner] 19:57:21
 ISSUES, AMONG THE HOMELESS COMMUNITY ITSELF, IT IS UNHEALTHY AN UNSAFE.
MY

[Captioner] 19:57:24
 HUMBLED REQUEST TO FREMONT CITY COUNCIL AND GOVERNMENT TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE AND CHILDREN IN THIS

[Captioner] 19:57:29
 FREMONT CITY CAN BREATHE FOR SAFETY AND CAN

[Captioner] 19:57:33
 WALK AROUND IN THE MORNING.
WE HAD INITIAL WALK

[Captioner] 19:57:37
 AND ROLL EVENT AND WE HAD HARDLY ANY PARTICIPANTS IN THAT.
THANK YOU.

 THE 94538 ZIP CODE, BEEN HERE FOR ABOUT 15 YEARS.
THE SITUATION, WHAT IT IS RIGHT NOW,

[Captioner] 19:58:06
 ON CHAPEL, I'VE NEVER SEEN IT LIKE THAT.
I DO WALK THROUGH THERE

[Captioner] 19:58:11
 VERY OFTEN, AND I DO AGREE WITH THE RESOLUTION BY THE

[Captioner] 19:58:16
 PRINCIPALS, FOUR PRINCIPALS THAT HAVE FILED IT AND BY THE TEACHERS, BY

[Captioner] 19:58:20
 THE PTA AND BY THE PARENTS AND THE KIDS.
WE DO NEED TO SOLVE THIS

[Captioner] 19:58:22
 PROBLEM.
IT IS GETTING WORSE, IT'S NOT GETTING BETTER.


[Captioner] 19:58:30
MORE -- ARE COMING IN, MORE ACTIVITIES THAT I WOULD NOT WANT MY KIDS TO SEE, AND I'M

[Captioner] 19:58:34
 PRETTY SURE NONE OF YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEES THOSE ACTIVITIES THAT ARE GOING ON THROUGHOUT THE DAY.


[Captioner] 19:58:38
IF YOU DO GET A CHANCE, PLEASE STOP BY, SPEND A COUPLE HOURS THROUGHOUT THE

[Captioner] 19:58:42
 DAY, AND WITNESS FOR YOURSELF, SEE WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON THROUGHOUT THE DAY AND THEN YOU'LL GET

[Captioner] 19:58:47

 INFORMATION ABOUT THE YEAR JUST COMPLETED, WE'VE PREPARED THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION USING

[Captioner] 20:04:43
 UNAUDITED AMOUNTS.
WE'LL REPORT ON ANY MATERIAL AUDIT ADJUSTMENTS AT

[Captioner] 20:04:47
 THE TIME THE ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT IS PROVIDED TO THE CITY COUNCIL.


[Captioner] 20:04:56
WE UPDATE OUR REVENUE PROJECTIONS THROUGHOUT THE YEAR AS WE RECEIVE NEW

[Captioner] 20:05:01
 INFORMATION.
FOR EXAMPLE, WE USE THE FISCAL YEAR 2022-23

[Captioner] 20:05:05
 MID-YEAR REPORT IN MARCH TO INCREASE OUR ESTIMATES FOR SALES TAX, PROPERTY

[Captioner] 20:05:09
 TACK, AND HOTEL TAX.
WE LAST

[Captioner] 20:05:13
 ESTIMATED FISCAL YEAR 2022-23 GENERAL FUND REVENUES IN MAY AS PART OF

[Captioner] 20:05:18
 THE GENERAL FUND FORECAST INCLUDED IN THE FISCAL

[Captioner] 20:05:22
 YEAR 2023-24 PROPOSED BUDGET PRESENTATION.


[Captioner] 20:05:26
AS YOU CAN SEE, OUR ACTUAL COLLECTIONS OUTPERFORM THE ESTIMATE

[Captioner] 20:05:31
 BY $8.7 MILLION.
THE LARGEST COMPONENT OF THAT WAS SALES TAX.


[Captioner] 20:05:36
BUT I'LL TALK ABOUT THAT LAST.
THE FINAL INSTALLMENT OF

[Captioner] 20:05:40
 PROPERTY TAX PAYMENTS FROM THE COUNTY IN AUGUST INCLUDED FOUR MONTHS OF

[Captioner] 20:05:45
 SUPPLEMENTAL PROPERTY TAX, WHICH OUTPERFORMED THE MEI

[Captioner] 20:05:50
 THE MAY SYMPTOM BY

[Captioner] 20:05:53
 ALMOST $1.4 MILLION WITH ADDITIONAL COMING FROM SECURED YOU AND UNSECURED TAX ROLLS.


[Captioner] 20:05:57
THE LAST TWO MONTH OF BUSINESS TAX REVENUE EXCEEDED OUR

[Captioner] 20:06:01
 ESTIMATE BY $800,000, WITH CONTRIBUTIONS FROM BOTH THE

[Captioner] 20:06:05
 GENERAL BUSINESS AND THE RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION BUSINESS TAX CATEGORIES.


[Captioner] 20:06:11
THE MAJORITY OF THE OVERPERFORMANCE YOU SEE IN THE OTHER

[Captioner] 20:06:15
 REVENUE CATEGORY, $1.3 MILLION, RESULTED FROM

[Captioner] 20:06:19
 ADDITIONAL EARNINGS IN THE CITY'S INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AS INTEREST RATES

[Captioner] 20:06:23
 CONTINUE TO INCREASE DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER.
THE MAGNITUDE OF

[Captioner] 20:06:27
 THESE INCREASES TO OUR ESTIMATE ISN'T UNUSUAL, GIVEN THE LIMITED

[Captioner] 20:06:32
 INFORMATION ON WHICH THE ESTIMATE IS BASED.
HOWEVER, THE

[Captioner] 20:06:36
 LAST QUARTER OF 2022-23 SALES TAX REVENUE

[Captioner] 20:06:41
 RECEIVED IN AUGUST ADDED $5.2 MILLION TO OUR MAY

[Captioner] 20:06:45
 ESTIMATE.
AS YOU MAY RECALL, WE'VE

[Captioner] 20:06:50
 BEEN RECEIVING UNUSUALLY HIGH LEVELS OF SALES TAX REVENUE OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS,

[Captioner] 20:06:54
 AND THE CITY COUNCIL HAS INCREASED THE BUDGET UNCERTAINTY RESERVE

[Captioner] 20:06:58
 TO OFFSET SOME OF THE ASSOCIATED RISK.
IT TURNS OUT

[Captioner] 20:07:02
 THAT OUR CONCERNS WERE WELL-FOUNDED.
THE STATE HAS RECENTLY

[Captioner] 20:07:07
 INFORMED US THAT A PORTION OF OUR SALES TAX REVENUE WAS

[Captioner] 20:07:11
 INCORRECTLY REPORTED BY BUSINESSES LAST YEAR, AND THE STATE WILL BE

[Captioner] 20:07:15
 TAKING IT BACK BY REDUCING OUR SALES TAX REMITTANCES OVER

[Captioner] 20:07:19
 THE NEXT TWO TO THREE YEARS.
THE STATE

[Captioner] 20:07:24
 AGENCY RESPONSIBLE FOR ADMINISTERING SALES TAX IS STILL

[Captioner] 20:07:28
 INVESTIGATING THE MISREPORTING.
SO WE DON'T YET KNOW HOW MUCH WE'LL NEED

[Captioner] 20:07:32
 TO REPAY.
BUT OUR CURRENT ESTIMATE IS

[Captioner] 20:07:37
 APPROXIMATELY $28 MILLION.
BECAUSE SALES TAX INFORMATION IS

[Captioner] 20:07:41
 CONFIDENTIAL UNDER STATE LAW, THE LEVEL OF DETAIL I CAN PROVIDE IS VERY

[Captioner] 20:07:47
 LIMITED.
AS

[Captioner] 20:07:51
 NOTED ON THE SLIDE, THE FISCAL RECOVERY FUNDS WE RECEIVED FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

[Captioner] 20:07:55
 IN FISCAL YEAR 2021-22 ARE INCLUDED IN THE

[Captioner] 20:08:00
 "OTHER" REVENUE CATEGORY.
WE HAVE NO SIGNIFICANT REVENUE DATA YET

[Captioner] 20:08:04
 FOR THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR, BUT EXPECT TO RECEIVE SOME OF OUR FIRST PROPERTY

[Captioner] 20:08:08
 TAX AND SALES TAX REMITTANCES IN NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER.


[Captioner] 20:08:19
THE $312.6 MILLION OF ACTUAL EXPENDITURES YOU SEE ON THE SLIDE IS JUST SLIGHTLY

[Captioner] 20:08:23
 BELOW THE $313.1 MILLION ESTIMATE INCLUDED IN THE GENERAL FUND

[Captioner] 20:08:27
 FORECAST.
AS I'LL SHOW ON THE NEXT SLIDE, ALL OF THAT

[Captioner] 20:08:32
 ADDITIONAL SAVINGS REPRESENTS ENCUMBERED CONTRACTS THAT WILL BE PAID NEXT

[Captioner] 20:08:38
 YEAR.
AS I MENTIONED, WE'VE BEEN RECEIVING UNUSUALLY HIGH LEVELS OF SALES

[Captioner] 20:08:42
 TAX REVENUE OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS.
WE'VE TREATED MUCH OF THAT

[Captioner] 20:08:46
 AS ONE TIME REVENUE, AND ACCORDINGLY ALLOCATED TO ONE-TIME

[Captioner] 20:08:52
 USES.
IN ADDITION TO INCREASING THE BUDGET UNCERTAINTY RESERVE

[Captioner] 20:08:56
 DURING 2022-23, WE ALSO MADE A LARGE ALLOCATION TO THE CAPITAL

[Captioner] 20:09:01
 IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM, PAID OFF A PORTION OF THE CITY'S BONDS,

[Captioner] 20:09:05
 ESTABLISHED A RESERVE FOR OUR UNFUNDED ACCRUED LEAVE

[Captioner] 20:09:10
 LIABILITY, AND STABILIZED THE RISK MANAGEMENT FUND.


[Captioner] 20:09:14
THOSE ONE-TIME ITEMS ARE REFLECTED ON THE SLIDE IN THE DEBT SERVICE,

[Captioner] 20:09:18
 CAPITAL PROJECTS AND OTHER EXPENDITURES ROWS, AND ACCOUNT FOR

[Captioner] 20:09:22
 MOST OF THE YEAR OVER YEAR EXPENDITURE INCREASE YOU SEE.


[Captioner] 20:09:31
WE FINISHED

[Captioner] 20:09:35
 2021-22 WITH $43.2 MILLION OF UNRESERVED FUND BALANCE, OF

[Captioner] 20:09:40
 WHICH $22.1 MILLION WAS ARPA FISCAL RECOVERY FUNDS RECEIVED IN MAY 2022.


[Captioner] 20:09:45
IN THE ACTUALS COLUMN, YOU CAN SEE THE REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE ESTIMATE WE'VE JUST

[Captioner] 20:09:51
 REVIEWED, AS WELL AS THE ADDITION OF $1.2 MILLION

[Captioner] 20:09:55
 OF ENCUMBRANCES, CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS THAT REMAIN UNSPENT AT YEAR

[Captioner] 20:09:59
 END AND SERVE TO REDUCE THE ENDING UNRESERVED FUND BALANCE.


[Captioner] 20:10:04
BECAUSE WE FINISHED LAST FISCAL YEAR WITH SOME

[Captioner] 20:10:08
 UNANTICIPATED FUND BALANCE, AS PART OF THE YEAR-END REPORT, THE CITY

[Captioner] 20:10:12
 COUNCIL WAS ABLE TO ALLOCATE $10.7 MILLION TO THE

[Captioner] 20:10:16
 CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM.
AS I

[Captioner] 20:10:21
 MENTIONED EARLIER, YOU ALSO INCREASED THE BUDGET UNCERTAINTY RESERVE

[Captioner] 20:10:26
 BY $2.5 MILLION, WHICH MAKES UP ALMOST HALF OF

[Captioner] 20:10:31
 THE $5.6 MILLION ADDITION TO RESERVES IN THE CURRENT YEAR BUDGET COLUMN.
THE UNRESERVED FUND BALANCE ESTIMATE

[Captioner] 20:10:36
 SHOWN IN THE GENERAL FUND FORECAST

[Captioner] 20:10:40
 WAS $13.9 MILLION.
IN THE ACTUAL COLUMN YOU CAN SEE THAT OUR HIGHER

[Captioner] 20:10:45
 REVENUES SOMEWHAT OFFSET BY SLIGHT LEHIGHER TOTAL USES LEAVES US

[Captioner] 20:10:49
 WITH AN UNRESERVED ENDING FUND BALANCE

[Captioner] 20:10:54
 OF $21.9 MILLION.


[Captioner] 20:10:58
THE ADOPTED BUDGET FUNDS THE GENERAL FUND CONTINGENCY RESERVE AT THE CITY

[Captioner] 20:11:02
 COUNCIL POLICY LEVEL OF 16.7% OF

[Captioner] 20:11:06
 BUDGETED EXPENDITURES AND TRANSFERS OUT.
CONSISTENT WITH THE MINIMUM

[Captioner] 20:11:11
 RECOMMENDED BY THE GOVERNMENT FINANCE OFFICERS ASSOCIATION.


[Captioner] 20:11:16
THE CONTINGENCY RESERVE IS PRIMARILY INTENDED TO PROVIDE IMMEDIATE COMMUNITY

[Captioner] 20:11:19
 ASSISTANCE AND ENSURE SERVICE CONTINUITY IN THE FACE OF A MAJOR DISASTER.


[Captioner] 20:11:25
AS A REMINDER, IN JULY, THE CITY COUNCIL

[Captioner] 20:11:30
 ALLOCATED $3.4 MILLION FROM THE CONTINGENCY RESERVE TO PAY FOR

[Captioner] 20:11:34
 CLEAN-UP, REPAIR AND RECONSTRUCTION OF DAMAGES RESULTING FROM THE SEVERE WIND AND

[Captioner] 20:11:38
 RAIN WE EXPERIENCED IN DECEMBER AND JANUARY.
BECAUSE THOSE

[Captioner] 20:11:43
 DAMAGES WERE PART OF A FEDERALLY DECLARED EMERGENCY, STAFF ARE WORKING

[Captioner] 20:11:47
 WITH FEMA TO DOCUMENT OUR EXPENDITURES SO WE CAN

[Captioner] 20:11:52
 OBTAIN REIMBURSEMENT.
THE BUDGET UNCERTAINTY RESERVE, ON THE OTHER HAND, IS INTENDED TO

[Captioner] 20:11:56
 SERVE AS A KIND OF SHOCK ABSORBER TO DEAL WITH

[Captioner] 20:12:00
 CYCLIC ECONOMIC DOWNTURNS AND CHANGES IN OUR COST STRUCTURE.
THE COUNCIL

[Captioner] 20:12:04
 ADOPTED POLICY FOR THIS RESERVE IS TO FUND IT AT A LEVEL

[Captioner] 20:12:09
 CONSISTENT WITH THE REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE UNCERTAINTY OVER THE THREE-YEAR FORECAST

[Captioner] 20:12:13
 PERIOD.
WITH THE GOAL OF PROVIDING SUFFICIENT RESOURCES TO MAINTAIN

[Captioner] 20:12:18
 SERVICE LEVELS WHILE GIVING THE CITY AN OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND TO ITS

[Captioner] 20:12:22
 BUDGETARY CHALLENGES.
THANKS TO AN ADEQUATELY

[Captioner] 20:12:26
 FUNDED BUDGET UNCERTAINTY RESERVE WHEN THE COVID PANDEMIC INITIALLY IMPACTED OUR

[Captioner] 20:12:31
 REVENUES, WE WERE ABLE TO MAINTAIN SERVICE LEVELS TO THE COMMUNITY AND AVOID STAFF

[Captioner] 20:12:36
 LAYOFFS.
REFLECTING BOTH

[Captioner] 20:12:40
 THE INCREASING CONTRIBUTION OF VOLATILE SALES TAX REVENUE TO GENERAL FUND

[Captioner] 20:12:44
 RESOURCES, AND THE HEIGHTENED POSSIBILITY OF AN ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN

[Captioner] 20:12:48
 OR RECESSION, THE CITY COUNCIL APPROVED

[Captioner] 20:12:52
 A $7.5 MILLION INCREASE TO THE BUDGET UNCERTAINTY RESERVE, AS PART OF THE

[Captioner] 20:12:57
 2023-24 ADOPTED BUDGET.
NEXT SLIDE,

[Captioner] 20:13:01
 P PLEASE.
AS I MENTIONED EARLIER, THE STATE

[Captioner] 20:13:05
 WILL BE TAKING BACK LAST YEAR'S SALES TAX

[Captioner] 20:13:09
 OVERPAYMENT BY REDUCING OUR SALES TAX REMITTANCES OVER THE NEXT TWO

[Captioner] 20:13:14
 OR THREE YEARS.
CONSEQUENTLY, STAFF IS

[Captioner] 20:13:18
 RECOMMENDING THAT THE CITY COUNCIL LOAF THE UNRESERVED

[Captioner] 20:13:22
 BALANCE UNPROGRAMMED TO ABSORB THE LOSS OF REVENUE WE EXPECT TO

[Captioner] 20:13:27
 EXPERIENCE.
IN ADDITION TO THAT $21.9 MILLION UNRESERVED

[Captioner] 20:13:31
 FUND BALANCE, THE $20 MILLION BUDGET UNCERTAINTY RESERVE

[Captioner] 20:13:36
 IS ALSO AVAILABLE TO OFFSET REVENUE REDUCTIONS.
WE ANTICIPATE

[Captioner] 20:13:41
 RECEIVING MORE SPECIFIC INFORMATION FROM THE STATE OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL

[Captioner] 20:13:45
 MONTHS, AND AS PART OF THE 2023-24 MID-YEAR BUDGET REPORT

[Captioner] 20:13:49
 IN MARCH, STAFF WILL RECOMMEND ANY NECESSARY BUDGET ADJUSTMENTS FOR

[Captioner] 20:13:53
 THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR.
MEANWHILE,

[Captioner] 20:13:57
 TO ENSURE WE DON'T OUTSPEND OUR RESOURCES, STAFF PLANS TO SUSPEND

[Captioner] 20:14:03
 THE $5.5 MILLION OF ONGOING INCREASES WE BUDGETED THIS

[Captioner] 20:14:07
 YEAR FOR STREET, BUILDING AND PARKS MAINTENANCE.


[Captioner] 20:14:12
THE 2024-25 PROPOSED BUDGET WILL INCLUDE ANY ACTIONS

[Captioner] 20:14:17
 NECESSARY TO BRING OUR EXPENDITURES IN LINE WITH OUR REVENUES.


[Captioner] 20:14:21
THAT COULD INCLUDE A CONTINUATION OF MAINTENANCE SPENDING AT LAST YEAR'S LEVEL, AND

[Captioner] 20:14:25
 COULD ALSO INCLUDE DRAWING ON THE $15 MILLION ACCRUED LEAVE

[Captioner] 20:14:29
 RESERVE WE ESTABLISHED LAST YEAR.


[Captioner] 20:14:36
THE RESOLUTION ADOPTED BY THE CITY COUNCIL TO IMPLEMENT THE ANNUAL

[Captioner] 20:14:41
 OPERATING BUDGET ALSO INCLUDES AUTHORIZATION FOR THE CITY MANAGER

[Captioner] 20:14:45
 TO TAKE CERTAIN ADDITIONAL APPROPRIATION ACTIONS, BUT WITH

[Captioner] 20:14:49
 THE REQUIREMENT TO REPORT BACK ON THESE ACTIONS AT YEAR-END.


[Captioner] 20:14:53
THE AMOUNT OF INCREASED APPROPRIATIONS FOR THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR DUE

[Captioner] 20:14:58
 TO UNEXPENDED PRIOR

[Captioner] 20:15:02
 YEAR EN -- THE MAJORITY OF THAT

[Captioner] 20:15:08
 CARRYOVER, $28.8 MILLION, IS IN THE CAPITAL PROJECT FUNDS OR REIMBURSEMENT

[Captioner] 20:15:12
 GRANT FUNDS WITH ANOTHER $1.2 MILLION IN THE GENERAL FUND.


[Captioner] 20:15:17
IN ADDITION TOP APPROPRIATING THE ENCUMBRANCE

[Captioner] 20:15:21
 BALANCES, THE CITY MANAGER ALSO APPROVED THE APPROPRIATION OF

[Captioner] 20:15:25
 UNANTICIPATED GRANT AND FEE REVENUES THAT WERE RECEIVED DURING THE FISCAL YEAR.


[Captioner] 20:15:30
THE MAJORITY OF THAT WAS $2.3 MILLION OF FEDERAL

[Captioner] 20:15:34
 AND STATE GRANTS FOR THE CITY'S EMERGENCY RENTAL ASSISTANCE

[Captioner] 20:15:38
 AND KEEP FREMONT HOUSED PROGRAMS.
AND A FIVE

[Captioner] 20:15:43
 $500,000 GRANT FROM THE COUNTY FOR THE HOMELESS NAVIGATION CENTER.


[Captioner] 20:15:49
IN SUMMARY, STRONGER THAN ANTICIPATED REVENUES

[Captioner] 20:15:53
 LAST FISCAL YEAR LEFT THE GENERAL FUND

[Captioner] 20:15:58
 WITH $21.9 MILLION IN AVAILABLE UNRESERVED FUND BALANCE.
HOWEVER,

[Captioner] 20:16:02
 BECAUSE A LARGE PORTION OF THOSE REVENUES REPRESENT SALES TAX

[Captioner] 20:16:06
 THAT WE'LL NEED TO REPAY, WE'RE RECOMMENDING THAT THE CITY COUNCIL TAKE

[Captioner] 20:16:10
 NO APPROPRIATION ACTIONS AT THIS TIME.
ONCE WE

[Captioner] 20:16:14
 RECEIVE MORE CONCRETE

[Captioner] 20:16:18
 INFORMATION FROM THE STATE REGARDING THE AMOUNT AND TIME OF THE PAYMENT, WE'LL RECOMMEND ANY

[Captioner] 20:16:23
 NETION SAIR EE ADJUSTMENTS FOR THE YEAR AS PART OF THE MID-YEAR BUDGET REPORT AND INCLUDE ANY

[Captioner] 20:16:27
 NEEDED ADDITIONAL CHANGES IN THE 2024-25 PROPOSED

[Captioner] 20:16:31
 OPERATING BUDGET.


[Captioner] 20:16:35
WE PLAN TO PRESENT THE MID-YEAR BUDGET REPORT ON MARCH 5TH AND

[Captioner] 20:16:40
 THE PROPOSED OPERATING BUDGET FOR NEXT FISCAL YEAR ON MAY 14TH.


[Captioner] 20:16:45
THE FIRST PUBLIC HEARING ON THE PROPOSED BUDGET WILL BE HELD ON JUNE 4TH, WITH

[Captioner] 20:16:50
 THE SECOND PUBLIC HEARING AND BUDGET ADOPTION SCHEDULED FOR JUNE 11TH.


[Captioner] 20:16:54
I'VE COMPLETED MY PRESENTATION, AND I'LL RETURN THE FLOOR TO THE MAYOR FOR QUESTIONS AND DISCUSSION.


[Captioner] 20:17:02
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
AT THIS TIME, I'M GOING TO ASK FOR CLARIFYING QUESTIONS AND I SEE FIRST

[Captioner] 20:17:06
 COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL.


[Captioner] 20:17:12
>> Councilmember Campbell: THANK YOU FOR THIS PRESENTATION, AND ALSO FOR THE HOUR

[Captioner] 20:17:17
 YOU SPENT WITH ME KIND OF BRIEFING ME ON ALL OF THIS

[Captioner] 20:17:21
 INFORMATION BECAUSE IT IS RATHER DETAILED

[Captioner] 20:17:25
 SO I REALLY APPRECIATE THE TIME THAT YOU SHARED WITH ME.
AND ANSWERING MY

[Captioner] 20:17:29
 PRE-QUESTIONS AS WELL.
SO I JUST HAVE ONE -- I THINK I SAW JUST ONE OTHER QUESTION

[Captioner] 20:17:33
 THAT I DIDN'T INCLUDE IS

[Captioner] 20:17:38
 THIS -- WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SUSPENDING

[Captioner] 20:17:41
 THE $5.5 MILLION FOR MAINTENANCE, ET CETERA, ET CETERA, HOW LONG DO YOU THINK THAT WOULD BE?


[Captioner] 20:17:46
IS THAT JUST ONE YEAR OR IS IT SEVERAL?
>> Mr.

[Captioner] 20:17:50
 Persselin: SO FOR NOW, WE'RE SUSPENDING IT FOR THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR UNTIL WE GET

[Captioner] 20:17:54
 MORE INFORMATION FROM THE STATE.
ONCE WE KNOW WHAT OUR SITUATION IS GOING TO BE

[Captioner] 20:17:58
 ON AN ONGOING BASIS, THEN WE'LL DETERMINE WHETHER WE CAN AFFORD

[Captioner] 20:18:03
 TO REINSTATE THOSE INCREASES OR WHETHER WE NEED TO KEEP THE MAINTENANCE

[Captioner] 20:18:08
 SPENDING AT THE CURRENT LEVEL.
>> Councilmember Campbell: WHAT KIND OF AN IMPACT IS

[Captioner] 20:18:12
 THAT GOING TO HAVE IN TERMS OF STREET MAINTENANCE AND

[Captioner] 20:18:17
 POTHOLES AND ANY OTHER THINGS WE MIGHT SEE

[Captioner] 20:18:21
 FROM RAIN OR BAD WEATHER OR -- WILL THAT IMPACT ANYTHING THAT

[Captioner] 20:18:27
 WE'VE ALREADY ENCUMBERED?
>> WELL, THE GOOD NEWS IS

[Captioner] 20:18:31
 THAT LAST FISCAL YEAR, WE INCREASED OUR ONGOING

[Captioner] 20:18:35
 MAINTENANCE TRANSFERS BY $2 MILLION OVER WHAT WE HAD BEEN DOING.


[Captioner] 20:18:42
SO WE'RE ACTUALLY DOING BETTER THAN WE HAVE HISTORICALLY.
CLEARLY WE

[Captioner] 20:18:46
 WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO SPEND MORE ON STREET AND BUILDING

[Captioner] 20:18:50
 AN PARKS MAINTENANCE, BUT THE OTHER THING TO THINK ABOUT IS

[Captioner] 20:18:54
 THAT BECAUSE WE WERE ABLE TO TRANSFER SO MUCH ONE-TIME MONEY INTO THE

[Captioner] 20:18:58
 CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM, WE HAVE LARGE NUMBER OF

[Captioner] 20:19:02
 CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS THAT ARE MOVING FORWARD AND WILL NOT BE AFFECTED BY

[Captioner] 20:19:06
 THE SUSPENSION OF THE ONGOING MAINTENANCE TRANSFERS.
>> Councilmember Campbell: THANK YOU 

[Captioner] 20:19:10
SO MUCH FOR THAT.
AND THEN THE OTHER QUESTION THAT I HAD

[Captioner] 20:19:16
 WAS ABOUT THE

[Captioner] 20:19:22
 UNRESERVED FUND, IF WE DO HAVE TO USE THAT MONEY TO REPAY

[Captioner] 20:19:26
 THE SALES TAX, THE OVERPAYMENT OF THE SALES TAX, WHEN DO YOU THINK

[Captioner] 20:19:30
 WE WOULD BE ABLE TO REPLENISH OUR RESERVES?


[Captioner] 20:19:34
AND IS THAT -- DOES THAT -- IF WE HAVE TO USE IT, DOES

[Captioner] 20:19:39
 THAT GO BELOW THE RECOMMENDED TWO MONTHS OF RESERVES

[Captioner] 20:19:43
 THAT WE NEED TO HAVE -- TO CONTINUE OPERATIONS?
DID

[Captioner] 20:19:46
 THAT MAKE SENSE?
>> Mr. Persselin: WELL, IT DOES.
THE TWO MONTHS THAT YOU'RE REFERRING 

[Captioner] 20:19:50
TO IS THE 16.7% OF BUDGETED

[Captioner] 20:19:55
 EXPENDITURES AND TRANSFERS OUT.
NOW THAT RELATES TO THE

[Captioner] 20:19:59
 CONTINGENCY RESERVE.
WHAT WE PLAN TO USE TO OFFSET

[Captioner] 20:20:03
 REVENUE SHORT FALLS IS THE BUDGET UNCERTAINTY RESERVE.
SO THAT'S THE RESERVE

[Captioner] 20:20:07
 THAT CURRENTLY SITS AT $20 MILLION.
TO THE EXTENT THAT WE NEED TO

[Captioner] 20:20:11
 DRAW THAT DOWN, BECAUSE REVENUES HAVE DROPPED

[Captioner] 20:20:17
 SIGNIFICANTLY, THEN WE WOULD -- ONCE WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY WITH

[Captioner] 20:20:22
 ONE-TIME SURPLUS FUNDS, WE WOULD TRY TO BUILD THAT BACK UP TO A

[Captioner] 20:20:27
 LEVEL CONSISTENT WITH WHAT WE THINK THE UNCERTAINTY IS.
NOW IT MAY

[Captioner] 20:20:31
 BE THE CASE THAT ONCE WE HAVE RESOLVED WITH

[Captioner] 20:20:35
 THE STATE WHAT OUR ONGOING SALES TAX

[Captioner] 20:20:39
 REF NEUS MIGHT BE, WE MIGHT NOT NEED TO RE-ESTABLISH IT AT THE $20 MILLION

[Captioner] 20:20:44
 LEVEL, BECAUSE PART OF THE REASON WE BOOSTED IT UP SO HIGH WAS BECAUSE WE WERE

[Captioner] 20:20:48
 SEEING THOSE ANOMALOUS SALES TAX REVENUES.
>> Councilmember Campbell: OKAY.


[Captioner] 20:20:52
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
CLARIFYING

[Captioner] 20:20:56
 QUESTIONS, COUNCILMEMBER SHAO.


[Captioner] 20:20:59
>> Councilmember Shao: THANK YOU, MAYOR.
THIS IS FOR THE PUBLIC.


[Captioner] 20:21:07
WHETHER THIS $28 MILLION PAY BACK WOULD HAVE AN IMPACT ON

[Captioner] 20:21:12
 OUR ONGOING ACQUISITION PROCESS FOR THE BUILDING RIGHT

[Captioner] 20:21:16
 NEXT TO OUR CITY GOVERNMENT, AND WE ARE CURRENTLY DOING THE

[Captioner] 20:21:22
 EXTENDED DUE DILIGENCE

[Captioner] 20:21:26
 STUDY, SO JUST FOR THE PUBLIC, THAT

[Captioner] 20:21:30
 ACQUISITION?


[Captioner] 20:21:35
>> Mr. Persselin: I'M GOING TO DEFER TO THE CITY MANAGER ON THAT.
>> City Mgr. Shackelford: SO

[Captioner] 20:21:39
 WE ARE OUT OF THE DUE DILIGENCE PERIOD NOW FOR

[Captioner] 20:21:44
 THAT ACQUISITION, AND

[Captioner] 20:21:48
 WE'VE WITHDRAWN OUR INTEREST IN IT FOR A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT REASONS.


[Captioner] 20:21:52
SO THIS DOES NOT HAVE AN IMPACT ON THAT AT THIS POINT.
>> Councilmember Shao: THANK

[Captioner] 20:21:57
 YOU.
THE SECOND QUESTION IS RELATED.
WOULD

[Captioner] 20:22:01
 THAT ALSO IMPACT OUR PLAN TO BUILD OUR NEW

[Captioner] 20:22:07
 COMMUNITY CENTER

[Captioner] 20:22:13
?
>> Mr. Persselin: WE AREN'T CURRENTLY PLANNING ON TAKING ANY MONEY AWAY FROM 

[Captioner] 20:22:17
THAT PROJECT THAT WE'VE ALREADY COMMITTED FUNDING TO.
AS YOU KNOW, THERE IS STILL

[Captioner] 20:22:21
 FUNDING TO BE COLLECTED

[Captioner] 20:22:25
 FOR THAT PROJECT.
BUT I BELIEVE WE HAVE

[Captioner] 20:22:29
 SUFFICIENT FUNDS IN THE CIP RIGHT NOW TO MOVE FORWARD WITH

[Captioner] 20:22:34
 THE DESIGN AND PLANNING PROCESS, AND I THINK THE PLAN

[Captioner] 20:22:38
 IS, OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS, TO PURVIEW FUNDING FROM

[Captioner] 20:22:43
 A VARIETY OF SOURCES.
>> Councilmember Shao: THANK

[Captioner] 20:22:47
 YOU.
>> Mayor Mei: NEXT, CLARIFYING QUESTIONS FROM VICE MAYOR COX.


[Captioner] 20:22:53
>> Vice Mayor Cox: THANK YOU, MAYOR.
I APPRECIATE ALL

[Captioner] 20:22:57
 THE HARD WORK ON THIS YEAR-END BUDGET REPORT DRAFT.


[Captioner] 20:23:02
I HAD A

[Captioner] 20:23:06
 QUESTION, IN REGARDS TO THE AMERICAN RESCUE FEDERAL FUNDS, HAVE WE RECEIVED ALL OF THE

[Captioner] 20:23:11
 FUNDING THAT WE WERE OWED?
>> Mr. Persselin: WE

[Captioner] 20:23:15
 HAVE.
THE ARPA FUNDS WERE DISTRIBUTED IN TWO

[Captioner] 20:23:21
 PIECES.
ONE SECTION THAT WE RECEIVED IN 2021 AN THE OTHER THAT WE RECEIVED

[Captioner] 20:23:26
 IN 21-22.
>> AND WHAT ABOUT THE

[Captioner] 20:23:31
 FEMA REIMBURSEMENT, HAS THAT ALL COME IN OR IS THAT STILL AWAITING FOR US TO

[Captioner] 20:23:35
 GET MORE MONEYS FROM THE FEDERAL SIDE?
>> Mr. Persselin: SO

[Captioner] 20:23:40
 WE HAVE SORT OF TWO SETS OF FEMA REIMBURSEMENT

[Captioner] 20:23:45
 ACTIVITIES ONGOING RIGHT NOW.
ONE RELATES TO COVID, THE

[Captioner] 20:23:49
 COVID EMERGENCY.
WE'VE SUBMITTED ALL OF OUR PROJECTS

[Captioner] 20:23:53
 TO FEMA AND FEMA IS NOW GOING THROUGH THEIR INTERNAL

[Captioner] 20:23:58
 REVIEW PROCESS.
THE SECOND SET OF PROJECTS RELATES TO THE WINTER STORMS

[Captioner] 20:24:03
 THAT WE EXPERIENCED, AND WE'RE IN THE PROCESS OF ACTIVELY

[Captioner] 20:24:07
 WORKING WITH FEMA STAFF TO COLLECT ALL OF THE

[Captioner] 20:24:11
 COST INFORMATION SO THAT THEY CAN BEGIN THEIR REVIEW

[Captioner] 20:24:16
 PROCESS.
>> Vice Mayor Cox: IS THE REIMBURSEMENT FOR

[Captioner] 20:24:21
 THOSE TWO THAT ARE OUTSTANDING, DO YOU THINK WE'LL GET THAT BEFORE THE END OF

[Captioner] 20:24:25
 THIS PHYSICAL YEAR?
AND THAT KIND OF

[Captioner] 20:24:29
 ROLLS INTO NEXT YEAR.
GLI WOULDN'T COUNT ON

[Captioner] 20:24:33
 RECEIVING IT IN THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR.
FROM EVERYTHING WE KNOW ABOUT HOW FEMA 

[Captioner] 20:24:38
OPERATES, IT TAKES A LONG TIME FOR THEM

[Captioner] 20:24:42
 TO WORK --

[Captioner] 20:24:46

>> Vice Mayor Cox: I SAW ALL THE DIFFERENT GRANTS THAT WILL BE 

[Captioner] 20:24:50
ENCUMBERED.
I WANTED TO FIND OUT, ARE ALL OF THOSE TO BE RECEIVED NOW DURING

[Captioner] 20:24:54
 OUR FISCAL YEAR, OR IS THAT ALSO GOING TO BE SOMETHING THAT'S FOR NEXT YEAR?


[Captioner] 20:24:58
THAT'S THE LIST YOU HAD

[Captioner] 20:25:04
 ON --
>> Mr. Persselin: RIGHT.
SO SOME

[Captioner] 20:25:08
 OF THOSE GRANTS ARE UP-FRONT GRANTS WHERE

[Captioner] 20:25:12
 WE HAVE ALREADY RECEIVED THE FUNDS.
SOME OF THOSE

[Captioner] 20:25:16
 ARE REIMBURSEMENT-TYPE GRANTS.


[Captioner] 20:25:20
SO WHEN THE CITY SPENDS, THEN THE CITY SUBMITS A REIMBURSEMENT REQUEST.


[Captioner] 20:25:26
SO WE MAY STILL BE WAITING TO BE REIMBURSED AND FOR SOME

[Captioner] 20:25:30
 OF THOSE THAT ARE MULTI-YEAR GRANTS, WE MAY NOT

[Captioner] 20:25:35
 HAVE SPENT ALL OF THE FUNDS YET.
>> Vice Mayor Cox: OKAY.


[Captioner] 20:25:39
MY LAST QUESTION WAS ON THE FRANCHISE FEES.
IS THAT TIED IN WITH THE TAX FEES THAT

[Captioner] 20:25:43
 ARE RELATED IT

[Captioner] 20:25:47
 ALSO TO THE SALES TAX REVENUE?
I SAW THERE WAS A

[Captioner] 20:25:52
 DECLINE ON THE FRANCHISE FEES.
THAT WAS A NEGATIVE IMPACT.


[Captioner] 20:25:56
AND TRYING TO TIE IN

[Captioner] 20:26:00
 WHERE -- WHY DID THAT GO DOWN, WHAT WAS THE ROOT

[Captioner] 20:26:04
 CAUSE?

>> Mr. Persselin: SO OUR

[Captioner] 20:26:08
 FRANCHISE FEES CONSIST OF THREE MAJOR DIFFERENT SOURCES OF REVENUE.
ONE

[Captioner] 20:26:12
 OF THEM IS A FEE THAT WE SPEEF RELATED TO

[Captioner] 20:26:17
 GROSS RECEIPTS FOR PG&E ELECTRIC AND GAS BILLS

[Captioner] 20:26:21
 THROUGHOUT THE CITY.
THAT'S A STATE-WIDE FRANCHISE.


[Captioner] 20:26:26
IT'S A PERCENTAGE UNDER STATE LAW THAT WE RECEIVE, AND THAT

[Captioner] 20:26:30
 IS AN INCREASING AMOUNT.


[Captioner] 20:26:34
THE SECOND CATEGORY IS OUR SOLID WASTE FRANCHISE FEE,

[Captioner] 20:26:38
 AND THAT IS A NEGOTIATED

[Captioner] 20:26:45
 FEE THAT WE NEGOTIATE WITH OUR

[Captioner] 20:26:49
 SOLIDER FOR AND THAT ALSO

[Captioner] 20:26:53
 WAS INCREASING.
THE THIRD FRANCHISE FEE RELATES TO CABLE TELEVISION,

[Captioner] 20:26:58
 AND OVER TIME, AS MORE PEOPLE ARE

[Captioner] 20:27:03
 RECEIVING THEIR ENTERTAINMENT THROUGH CHANNELS OTHER THAN

[Captioner] 20:27:07
 CABLE TELEVISION, THAT HAS BEEN A DECLINING

[Captioner] 20:27:11
 REVENUE STREAM.
SO OVER TIME, WE EXPECT THAT TO CONTINUE TO

[Captioner] 20:27:15
 DECLINE.


[Captioner] 20:27:20
>> Vice Mayor Cox: THANK YOU FOR THE DETAILED EXPLANATION.
I APPRECIATE IT.


[Captioner] 20:27:25
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
AT THIS TIME, I'D LIKE TO OPEN THE PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD,

[Captioner] 20:27:29
 AND I'D LIKE TO SEE IF THE CITY CLERK HAS ANY

[Captioner] 20:27:33
 SPEAKERS.
>> Ms. Gauthier: CURRENTLY ONE SPEAKER CARD, KELLY

[Captioner] 20:27:39
 ABREU.
>> Mayor Mei: WELCOME.
>> Ms. Gauthier: MAYOR,

[Captioner] 20:27:43
 MINUTES?
TWO?
>> I'M GOING TO NEED THREE MINUTES.


[Captioner] 20:27:49
THE HEADLINE NUMBERS THAT THIS COUNCIL IS BEING GIVEN TODAY ARE HIGHLY MISLEADING.


[Captioner] 20:27:55
THIS COUNCIL IS -- AT THE SAME TIME THAT YOU'RE SEEING HEADLINE NUMBERS LIKE

[Captioner] 20:28:00
 THIS THING, REVENUES EXCEED ESTIMATE

[Captioner] 20:28:04
 BY $8.7 MILLION.
THE $28 MILLION ISN'T IN HERE.
NEVER BOTHERED TO SUBTRACT IT OUT.


[Captioner] 20:28:08
NONE OF THE NUMBERS HAS BEEN SUBTRACTED, NOT EVEN A GUESS, NOT EVEN A WHATEVER.


[Captioner] 20:28:13
LATER ON, IT'S ALL WHISPER NUMBERS UNDER THE TABLE.


[Captioner] 20:28:18
THE NUMBERS HERE ARE ROSIE.
THE REAL

[Captioner] 20:28:23
 NUMBERS ARE LOOKING BAD, A AND WE CAN'T EVEN PAVE THE STREETS NOW.
CAN'T EVEN FIX THE

[Captioner] 20:28:27
 POTHOLES.
CAN'T EVEN REPAIR THE PARKS LIKE

[Captioner] 20:28:32
 5 1/2 MILLION WORTH OF MAINTENANCE.
THIS COUNCIL HAS A SHORT

[Captioner] 20:28:36
 MEMORY, IT HASN'T ANY FINANCE SUBCOMMITTEE TO ASK THE TOUGH QUESTIONS, OVERSEE

[Captioner] 20:28:41
 THE BUDGET -- THESE MASSIVE BUDGET IRREGULARITIES.


[Captioner] 20:28:45
MASSIVE.
FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOU GO BACK TO

[Captioner] 20:28:49
 NOVEMBER 13TH, 2018, YOU WERE TOLD IN THE REPORT FROM THE FINANCE DEPARTMENT

[Captioner] 20:28:54
 THAT 1-PINT $9 MILLION OF THE SALES TAX REVENUE

[Captioner] 20:28:59
 REPRESENTS PRIOR YEAR -- AUTO SALES ACCOUNT FOR MOST OF THE REMAIN

[Captioner] 20:29:04
ING SALES TAX OVER PERFORMANCE.
STAFF ALONG WITH THE CITY'S

[Captioner] 20:29:08
 SALES TAX CONSULTANT IS CLOSELY MONITORING SALES TAX RECEIPTS AS OF

[Captioner] 20:29:13
 NOVEMBER 13TH, 2018.
WHAT HAPPENED TO ALL THAT EXPERTISE BEING

[Captioner] 20:29:18
 FOCUSED ON -- WHAT IS THIS, 30 SECONDS LEFT?
HOW

[Captioner] 20:29:22
 MANY MINUTES DID I HAVE?
>> Mayor Mei:

[Captioner] 20:29:27
 30 SECONDS ARE LEFT.
>> Ms. Gauthier: THE MAYOR SAYS 2.
>> WELL, THAT'S CONVENIENT FOR

[Captioner] 20:29:31
 YOUR BUDGET DIRECTOR.
THE CITY COUNCIL WAS TOLD THAT EVERYTHING WAS

[Captioner] 20:29:35
 ROSIE LAST MARCH, REFLECTING DRAMATICALLY HIGHER LEVELS OF SALES TAX TO

[Captioner] 20:29:39
 RECEIVE LAST YEAR THE PRELIMINARY FORECAST FOR ONGOING SALES TAX REVENUE HAS BEEN INCREASED BY ABOUT

[Captioner] 20:29:43
 30%.
YOU WERE NOT TOLD ABOUT EXCESS RISK.
YOU WERE

[Captioner] 20:29:48
 TOLD THAT EVERYTHING WAS ROSEY AND WE ARE INCREASING OUR SALES TAX

[Captioner] 20:29:51
 REVENUE FORECAST.
>> Ms. Gauthier: YOUR TIME IS UP.
>> IN MARCH.


[Captioner] 20:29:55
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
>> SALES

[Captioner] 20:29:59
 TAX

[Captioner] 20:30:03
 IS --
>> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.
AND AT THIS

[Captioner] 20:30:08
 TIME, I'LL CLOSE PUBLIC COMMENT.
PLEASE NOTE THAT ANY COMMENTS YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEND, IF

[Captioner] 20:30:12
 IT'S EXCEEDING THAT TIME PERIOD, YOU'RE WELCOME TO SEND THAT

[Captioner] 20:30:15
 TO US.
THIS IS OUR FIRST REVIEW OF THE YEAR-END BUDGET.


[Captioner] 20:30:19
SO AT THIS TIME, I'M GOING TO TURN IT BACK TO THE COUNCIL.
FOR

[Captioner] 20:30:24
 QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS.
ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS

[Captioner] 20:30:26
 OR COMMENTS?
WE ALSO NEED A MOTION ON THIS, BUT I WILL MAKE SOME COMMENTS.


[Captioner] 20:30:33
OH, I SEE A COMMENT FROM COUNCILMEMBER SHAO.
OTHERWISE I WAS ABOUT TO SPEAK.


[Captioner] 20:30:37
YOU GO FIRST.
>> Councilmember Shao: THANK YOU, MAYOR.


[Captioner] 20:30:41
AS I EXPLAINED, THIS IRREGULARITY

[Captioner] 20:30:45
 COMES DIRECTLY FROM THE STATE GOVERNMENT,

[Captioner] 20:30:49
 AND ALSO THERE ARE LAWS THAT WOULD PROTECT THE PRIVACY

[Captioner] 20:30:55
 OF THOSE COMPANIES THAT FILE INFORMATION TO THE

[Captioner] 20:30:59
 STATE GOVERNMENT.
SO WE

[Captioner] 20:31:03
 CANNOT FORESEE OR EVEN

[Captioner] 20:31:07
 RETROSPECTIVELY REVIEW THIS IRREGULARITY TO LEARN

[Captioner] 20:31:12
 LESSONS AND PREVENT IT.
WE'RE ONLY AT THE

[Captioner] 20:31:16
 MERCY OF THE WORK OF THE STATE GOVERNMENT.
BUT FORTUNATELY,

[Captioner] 20:31:21
 WE DO HAVE UNCERTAINTY RESERVE, JUST

[Captioner] 20:31:25
 FOR THAT PURPOSE.
AND I'M

[Captioner] 20:31:29
 GLAD THAT THIS CITY COUNCIL WISELY

[Captioner] 20:31:35
 PUT MORE MONEY BEING THAT UNCERTAINTY RESERVE

[Captioner] 20:31:39
 WHEN WE RECEIVED MORE SALES TACK REVENUES THAN WE EXPECTED.


[Captioner] 20:31:43
SO IN A WAY, WE

[Captioner] 20:31:47
 HAVE ALREADY FORESEEN THE RISK AND WE HAVE ALREADY TAKEN

[Captioner] 20:31:53
 ACTIONS TO MINIMIZE THAT RISK.
FOR THAT, I

[Captioner] 20:31:57
 THINK THE RECOMMENDATION FROM THE STAFF FOR THAT AND WE

[Captioner] 20:32:02
 ARE ALSO TAKING THE RIGHT ACTION IN THE

[Captioner] 20:32:07
 RIGHT DIRECTION, NOBODY HAS

[Captioner] 20:32:11
 A 2020 HINDSIGHT FOR THAT,

[Captioner] 20:32:16
 BUT WE CAN ALWAYS USE THIS AS WHAT YOU CALL EXPERIENCE OR

[Captioner] 20:32:22
 LESSON TO BETTER PLAN

[Captioner] 20:32:34
>> Mayor Mei:   I'LL MAKE MY 
COMMENTS AT THIS TIME.
THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION

[Captioner] 20:32:38
.
I DO KNOW THAT WE HAVE BEEN 
FORTUNATE IN SOME OF THE 


[Captioner] 20:32:42
CHALLENGING TIMES TO SEE AUTO

[Captioner] 20:32:46
 
SALES, BUT WE FORECASTED THAT

[Captioner] 20:32:50
 
THERE WAS A LOT OF BUDGET 
UNSEARCHITY

[Captioner] 20:32:56
.
FOR US TO THEN NOT HAVE TO

[Captioner] 20:32:59
 DO 
SOME OF THE EXTREME COST 
CUTTINGS THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO 


[Captioner] 20:33:03
DO IN TERMS OF IMPACT TO OUR 
STAFF AND SERVICES.

[Captioner] 20:33:08

WHILE WE WERE TRYING TO KEEP 
THINGS FLAT TO DOWN

[Captioner] 20:33:12
, WE HAVE 
CONTINUED TO BE PRUDENT IN TERMS

[Captioner] 20:33:17
 
OF PAYING DOWJ YOUR HONOR FUNDED 
LIABILITIES,

[Captioner] 20:33:22
 ALLOWED US TO 
CREATE THIS UNCERTAINTY RESERVE

[Captioner] 20:33:27
.
WHILE WE DIDN'T KNOW THAT THE 
STATE

[Captioner] 20:33:31
 WOULD COME BACK, HAVING 
SEEN SOME OF THE PAST PRACTICES

[Captioner] 20:33:34
 
AND CHALLENGES, IN ADDITION TO 
THE STATE HAVING THE CHALLENGES, 


[Captioner] 20:33:39
I THINK THAT BEING IN 
UNPRECEDENTED PANDEMIC FOR US

[Captioner] 20:33:43
 AS 
MODERN TIMES TO BE ABLE TO 
FORECAST OUR REVENUES I THINK

[Captioner] 20:33:46
 
KEEPING THAT RESERVE WAS 
DEFINITELY A SENATORRER THICK TO 


[Captioner] 20:33:50
DO AND THAT IMPACT BEING SPREAD 
OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS,

[Captioner] 20:33:52
 
WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT WE COULD 
DRAW DOWN FROM.


[Captioner] 20:33:57
YES, I WOULD ENCOURAGE, I KNOW 
THAT WE HAVE TAKEN POLICIES IN 
THE

[Captioner] 20:34:01
 PAST AND MOVING FORWARD EVEN 
WITH THIS TO CONTINUE TO BE

[Captioner] 20:34:06
 
FISCALLY PRUDENT BECAUSE I THINK 
THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO MINIMIZE 


[Captioner] 20:34:10
OR MITIGATE SOME OF THE RISK.
WHEN IT COMES TO OTHER GRANTS I 
THINK THAT AS A

[Captioner] 20:34:14
 CITY WE WILL 
CONTINUE TO CHAMPION AND TO TRY 
TO SECURE ANY OF THOSE SOURCES 


[Captioner] 20:34:18
AND THAT IS ONE OF THE THINGS 
THAT HAS BEEN HELPFUL.
I KNOW LOOKING OUT IN THE 


[Captioner] 20:34:22
AUDIENCE I SEE A LOT OF OUR 
STAFF MEMBERS BUT WHETHER IT'S 
WITH HEALTH AND

[Captioner] 20:34:26
 HUMAN SERVICES, 
WHETHER IT'S WITH TRANSPORTATION 
OR OTHER GRANTS AVAILABLE OR 


[Captioner] 20:34:29
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT WE TRY TO 
SEEK EVERY SORT OF FUNDING 
POSSIBLE.


[Captioner] 20:34:33
AND SO EVEN WITH AND I HAVE TO 
THANK YOU

[Captioner] 20:34:39
 DIRECTOR PERSSELIN

[Captioner] 20:34:43
.
I THINK I'M COMFORTABLE WITH 
THIS

[Captioner] 20:34:48
 RECOMMENDATION AND I'D LIKE 
TO SEE IF THERE WAS A MOTION.

[Captioner] 20:34:50

VICE MAYOR COX.
>> Vice Mayor Cox:   YES I WAS 


[Captioner] 20:34:55
GOING TO MAKE A MOTION TO MOVE 
FORWARD WITH THE REPORT AND 
ACCEPT IT.


[Captioner] 20:34:59
>> Mayor Mei:   OKAY, I SEE A 
SECOND BY COUNCILMEMBER CAMPBELL

[Captioner] 20:35:00

CAMPBELL.
OKAY.


[Captioner] 20:35:04
GREAT.
>> The Clerk:   DO ROLL CALL.
>> Mayor Mei:   WE HAVE TO DO A 


[Captioner] 20:35:15
 A 
ROLL CALL.
ROLL CALL PLEASE.

[Captioner] 20:35:20

>> The Clerk:   COUNCILMEMBER

SO THANK YOU.

[Captioner] 20:35:48

THE COMMITTEES

OKAY SEEING NONE.
I'D LIKE TO ASK THAT WE AGAIN
