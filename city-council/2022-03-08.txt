19:08:13 ORGANIZATION LISTED ON THE AGENDA.

19:08:15 THE COUNCIL TOOK NO REPORTABLE ACTION.

19:09:19 MINUTES, SPECIFICALLY ON MARCH 1ST, 2022.

19:09:27 THERE IS A REFERENCE OF AMENDING THE SECTION CODE, BUT THERE'S NO TIE-IN ON 
19:09:37 THE MAP THAT WE DECIDED THE NDC91064 REVISED, I THINK THAT'S THE NAME OF 
19:09:40 IT,  NDC91064.

19:09:45 AND I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT WAS CLEAR IN THE MEETING MINUTES.

19:09:52 >> Ms. Gauthier: OKAY, I CAN EITHER MAKE THAT CORRECTION AND MOVE FORWARD 
19:09:56 WITH APPROVING THE MINUTES OR I CAN BRING JUST THAT SET OF MINUTES BACK TO 
19:10:00 THE NEXT MEETING FOR AN ADDITIONAL  REVIEW.

19:10:09 >> Councilmember Cox: IF YOU COULD JUST ADD THAT SPECIFIC MAP NUMBER, THE 
19:10:11 NDC91064 REVISED, THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL.

19:10:15 >> Ms. Gauthier: 91064 REVISED.

19:10:16 >> Councilmember Cox: CORRECT.

19:10:18 >> Ms. Gauthier: GOT IT.

19:10:22 >> Councilmember Cox: THAT WOULD BE ACCEPTABLE TO ADOPT THAT INTO THE 
19:10:24 MEETING MINUTES FROM  MARCH 1ST.

19:10:25 >> Ms. Gauthier: OKAY.

19:10:29 WE'LL NEED TO GET CONSENSUS AND A MOTION FROM THE REST OF THE COUNCIL FOR THAT.

19:10:39 >> Mayor Mei: THERE WAS A REQUEST -- [INAUDIBLE]

19:10:41 >> Ms. Gauthier: VICE MAYOR SALWAN HAS A HAND RAISED.

19:10:48 >> Vice Mayor Salwan: MOVE CONSENT WITH MODIFICATION OF MINUTES AS PROPOSED BY 
19:10:48 COUNCILMEMBER COX.

19:10:49 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:10:55 AND SO ROLL CALL, PLEASE FOR THE CONSENT CALENDAR.

19:11:38 TODAY, STARTING WITH OUR CITY MANAGER AND OUR CITY CLERK AND SO MANY OTHERS 
19:11:40 A HAPPY INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY TODAY.

19:15:33 I ENJOYED SERVING THE COMMUNITY WHEN I WAS DOING THE SMOKE DETECTOR PROGRAM

19:15:41 THAT WAS JUST SUCH A BLESSING TO BE ABLE TO HELP THOSE PEOPLE AND IT'S

19:16:52 THANK YOU FOR YOUR HEARTFELT EXPRESSIONS FOR OUR INCREDIBLE 
19:16:57 DEDICATED -- SUE RATH AND HER FAMILY.

19:17:06 SO NEXT ON OUR AGENDA THIS EVENING IS ORAL COMMUNICATIONS, AND THOSE ARE 
19:17:12 SPEAKERS WHO WISH TO SPEAK ON AN ITEM THAT IS NOT AGENDIZED FOR THIS EVENING.

19:17:16 WE WILL ALLOW -- LET ME SEE.

19:17:17 WE HAVE SPEAKERS.

19:17:24 >> Ms. Gauthier: WE CURRENTLY HAVE FOUR SPEAKERS, IT LOOKS LIKE.

19:17:27 HOW MANY MINUTES WOULD YOU LIKE, MAYOR?

19:17:31 >> Mayor Mei: IT CAN BE THREE, EACH SPEAKER.

19:17:32 >> Ms. Gauthier: THREE?

19:17:32 OKAY.

19:17:34 >> Mayor Mei: YES.

19:17:35 >> Ms. Gauthier: OKAY.

19:17:38 FIRST SPEAKER IS JOHN HINDS.

19:17:42 >> HELLO, EVERYONE.

19:17:47 A FEW WEEKS AGO IN AN ITEM ON CHANGES TO FREMONT BOULEVARD IN CENTERVILLE, 
19:17:51 COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN RAISED SOME IMPORTANT POINTS ABOUT THE USEFULNESS 
19:17:55 AND VALIDITY OF THE OPINION SURVEYS DONE RECENTLY BY PUBLIC WORKS.

19:18:01 AND I HAD SOME OF THE SAME CONCERNS A WHILE BACK ON RANCHO ARROYO.

19:18:05 TODAY I TOOK THE CURRENTLY OPEN SURVEY ON PASEO PADRE AND I HAVE TO SAY, 
19:18:08 THERE HAVE BEEN SOME IMPROVEMENTS.

19:18:10 THERE ARE SOME FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS THAT COULD BE MADE.

19:18:14 BUT BEFORE I GET INTO THOSE, I WANT TO SAY THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN 
19:18:20 SERVICES REALLY SHOULD BE TAKING SOME NOTES FROM WHAT PUBLIC WORKS IS DOING.

19:18:26 IN RECENT MEMORY, HUMAN SERVICES HAS ANNOUNCED SOME CHANGES THAT COULD HAVE 
19:18:29 AT LEAST AS MUCH IMPACT ON THE SURROUNDING NEIGHBORHOODS AS ANY 
19:18:36 CHANGE TO A ROADWAY, AND HAVING SOME ADVANCE OUTREACH TO NEIGHBORS LIKE 
19:18:40 THIS COULD GO A LONG WAY IN SHOWING RESPECT FOR THE NEIGHBORS AND NOT 
19:18:42 GETTING SO MUCH ANGER AFTERWARDS.

19:18:45 SO BACK TO PUBLIC WORKS.

19:18:52 THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS WITH ANY ANONYMOUS ONLINE SURVEY ARE IN SAMPLING AND 
19:18:54 INTEGRITY OF RESPONDENTS.

19:19:01 IN THE SAMPLING, WELL, RESPONDENTS SELECT THEMSELVES SO YOU GET AN ODD 
19:19:01 SELECTION OF PEOPLE.

19:19:05 IF THE SURVEY ISN'T VERY WELL ADVERTISED, YOU GET AN EVEN  ODDER 
19:19:10 SELECTION OF PEOPLE BASED ON WHO HAPPENED TO FIND OUT ABOUT THE SURVEY, 
19:19:14  HAVE IT POINTED OUT TO THEM BY A FRIEND OR JUST STUMBLE ACROSS IT.

19:19:18 THE EASY REMEDY THERE IS JUST TO ADVERTISE BETTER, TO GET A  BETTER 
19:19:22 SAMPLING OF PEOPLE, AND AT THE VERY LEAST, WE COULD BE PUTTING SIGNS UP 
19:19:25 ALONG THE SECTION OF ROAD THAT'S GOING TO BE CHANGED, KIND OF LIKE WHAT YOU 
19:19:26 DO BEFORE A ZONING HEARING.

19:19:32 ANNOUNCING NOT ONLY THE TIME AND PLACE OF PUBLIC MEETINGS OR COMMUNICATION 
19:19:34 MEETINGS, BUT ALSO THE WEB ADDRESS OF THE SURVEY.

19:19:41 AS FOR THE INTEGRITY OF RESPONDENTS, AS LONG AS THERE'S A POSSIBILITY THAT 
19:19:46 PEOPLE WITH A LOT OF TIME ON THEIR HANDS CAN PLAY GAMES WITH US 
19:19:49 ANONYMOUSLY, IT MEANS THE REST OF US HAVE TO DISCOUNT THE RESULTS SOME, 
19:19:54 WHICH WOULD BE A SHAME, BECAUSE IT'S CLEAR THAT SOME GOOD WORK HAS GONE 
19:19:55 INTO THIS STUFF.

19:19:58 ONE POSSIBILITY IS THE SURVEYS ARE ALREADY ASKING FOR PEOPLE'S EMAIL 
19:20:03 ADDRESSES, OPTIONALLY, AND FOR THEIR STREET NAMES,  OPTIONALLY.

19:20:08 IF WE ASK FOR THEIR FULL STREET ADDRESS OPTIONALLY AND EXPLAIN THAT WE WILL 
19:20:14 STILL COUNT ALL RESPONDENTS IN THE BASIC SCORE, BUT THEN DO A SECOND 
19:20:18 ALTERNATIVE SCORING THAT ONLY COVERS PEOPLE WHO PUT IN THEIR ACTUAL STREET 
19:20:20 ADDRESSES, THEN THERE ARE SOME INTEGRITY CHECKS.

19:20:25 WE CAN LOOK FOR MULTIPLE RESPONSES FROM THE SAME ADDRESS TO MAYBE DOWNWEIGHT 
19:20:25 THOSE A LITTLE BIT.

19:20:28 WE CAN LOOK FOR BOGUS ADDRESSES.

19:20:31 WE CAN ALSO MEASURE DISTANCES FROM THE CENTER OF ROAD THAT'S GOING TO BE 
19:20:33 CHANGED AND APPLY DIFFERENT WEIGHTINGS THERE.

19:20:38 ANYWAY, SUGGESTIONS LIKE THESE COULD MAKE THE SURVEYS MORE USEFUL, 
19:20:41 OTHERWISE WE JUST HAVE TO TAKE THEM WITH A GRAIN OF SALT.

19:20:42 THANK YOU.

19:20:43 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU,  MR. HINDS.

19:20:47 NEXT SPEAKER IS MARIE.

19:20:48 H.

19:20:49 WELCOME.

19:20:50 >> THANK YOU.

19:20:54 MY NAME IS MARIE HUGHES, AND I'M A LONG TIME RESIDENT OF FREMONT.

19:20:57 AND A MEMBER OF FREMONT FOR EVERYONE.

19:21:02 I WOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS MY SUPPORT FOR THE PROJECT HOMEKEY GRANT APPLICATION 
19:21:04 AND THE PILOT SAFE PARKING PROGRAM.

19:21:08 AS A RESIDENT OF NILES, I ALSO WANT TO THANK NILES DISCOVERY CHURCH FOR 
19:21:10 HOSTING THE SAFE PARKING PROGRAM.

19:21:14 I BELIEVE THEY HAVE DONE A GOOD JOB AND I APPRECIATE THEM BEING A GOOD 
19:21:16 NEIGHBOR TO OUR UNHOUSED POPULATION.

19:21:22 SPEAKING OF THESE PROGRAMS, I'VE HER THE FOLLOWING ARGUMENT AGAINST THEM:  
19:21:26 PEOPLE TELL ME THAT THEY ARE PIECEMEAL, AND THAT THE CITY SHOULD HAVE A 
19:21:28 COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO DEALING WITH HOMELESSNESS.

19:21:33 I AM CONFUSED BY THIS ARGUMENT BECAUSE I WAS PRETTY SURE THAT THE CITY DOES 
19:21:37 HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN IN ORDER TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF  HOMELESSNESS IN 
19:21:37 OUR AREA.

19:21:40 SO I WENT TO THE WEBSITE TO LOOK FOR IT.

19:21:45 I DID NOT SEE ANYTHING ON THE HOMELESSNESS IN FREMONT PAGE OR ANY OF 
19:21:46 THE CONNECTED PAGE.

19:21:54 I DID A SEARCH AND I WAS ABLE TO FIND A PDF DATED 2019 THAT DID APPEAR TO BE 
19:21:58 THE COMPREHENSIVE PLAN, BUT I'M NOT SURE IF IT'S THE LATEST OR NOT.

19:22:03 SO MY SUGGESTION IS THAT THE LATEST PLAN BE LINKED FROM THAT MAIN PAGE SO 
19:22:07 THAT IT'S EASIER FOR PEOPLE TO FIND, AND THEY CAN SEE HOW THESE PROGRAMS 
19:22:11 FIT INTO THE CITY'S LONG-TERM APPROACH.

19:22:18 AND IT MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA WHEN WE PUT UP NEW PROGRAMS TO ALSO SAY HOW THEY 
19:22:18 FIT IN TO THE APPROACH.

19:22:19 THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

19:22:23 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:22:35 NEXT SPEAKER IS GOPALAKRISHNAN PADMA.

19:22:35 >> GOOD EVENING.

19:22:40 I'M A 21-YEAR RESIDENT OF FREMONT AND I ALSO WORK IN THE CITY.

19:22:45 I WANT TO SAY THAT UNFORTUNATELY OF LATE, I'M VERY DISAPPOINTED TO SEE 
19:22:50 THAT THE CITY IS NOT ALIGNED TO THE NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY AND DOES NOT 
19:22:54 ENGAGE THE COMMUNITY TO SEEK INPUT BEFORE MAJOR DECISIONS ARE MADE.

19:22:59 THE TOP CONCERNS OF RESIDENTS IN MANY SURVEYS OVER THE YEARS HAVE BEEN 
19:23:04 TRAFFIC CONGESTION, CRIME, AND HOMELESSNESS, AND YET WE DO NOT SEE A 
19:23:06 COMPREHENSIVE PLAN TO ADDRESS ANY OF THESE.

19:23:19 USDS -- CATALYTIC CONVERTER THREATS, STEALING OF CARS ARE RAMPANT AND THE 
19:23:24 CRIMINALS ARE GETTING AWAY BECAUSE THERE ARE NO COPS WHO ARE PATROLLING 
19:23:25 TO MAKE THEIR PRESENCE KNOWN.

19:23:32 SPEEDING UNCHECKED ON OUR ROADS, SIDEWALKS ARE DANGEROUS, WHICH MAKES 
19:23:37 SOME PEOPLE WALK ON THE STREET AND INCREASES THE POSSIBILITY OF THEM 
19:23:37 BEING IN ACCIDENTS.

19:23:45 THERE'S A BIG PUSH TO NARROW LANES AND THAT LEADS TO MORE TRAFFIC CONGESTION.

19:23:48 AND ONE OF THE TOP CONCERNS OF THE RESIDENTS IS TRAFFIC CONDITION.

19:23:54 WHY WOULD WE CREATE MORE TRAFFIC CONGESTION?

19:24:01 THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN THE CITY IS SKYROCKETING AND WHAT DOES OUR 
19:24:05 COMPREHENSIVE PLAN TO ADDRESS THAT, FOR EXAMPLE, ARE WE ENGAGING WITH THE 
19:24:10 COMPANIES IN FREMONT TO GIVE THEM AN OPPORTUNITY FOR TEMPORARY EMPLOYMENT 
19:24:14 SO THAT THEY CAN GET SOME EXPERIENCE AND MOVE ON TO PERMANENT JOBS?

19:24:21 WHAT WE ARE SEEING IS PET PROJECTS, POLITICAL AGENDA IS BEING PURSUED AND 
19:24:25 WE ARE PURSUING EVERY POSSIBLE GRANT BECAUSE IT'S FREE MONEY, BUT THEY ALL 
19:24:26 COME WITH STRINGS ATTACHED.

19:24:31 THE COMMUNITY WAS NOT AWARE OF THE CITY'S PLANS TO CONVERT A MOTEL SIX 
19:24:38 INTO A LOW INCOME HOUSING -- AGENDA ON  JANUARY 14TH AND THE COUNCIL VOTED IN 
19:24:42 A HURRY TO APPLY FOR THE GRANT WITHOUT ENGAGING THE IRVINGTON COMMUNITY IN 
19:24:47 ANY DISCUSSION OR CHANCE TO PROVIDE FEEDBACK OTHER THAN THAT ONE MEETING 
19:24:48 ITSELF.

19:24:52 THERE IS A SAFE PARKING PROGRAM AND ONE OF THE SITES IS RIGHT NEXT TO THE 
19:24:56 AMERICAN HIGH  SCHOOL, AND IF I GO READ THE  FAQs FOR THE SAFE PARKING 
19:25:01 PROGRAM, IT ALLOWS SITES TO BE USED FOR 10 TO 24 HOURS A DAY FOR PARKING.

19:25:11 HOW IS IT SAFE FOR OUR STUDENTS TO WALK PAST IT WHEN THEY WALK TO SCHOOL WHEN 
19:25:14 THEY COULD BE PEOPLE THAT ARE GOING TO BE A DANGER TO THEM?

19:25:19 AND WHAT IS THE CITY GOING TO DO TO REVERSE THE TREND OF BEING MISALIGNED 
19:25:24 WITH THE COMMUNITY'S CONCERNS, NAMELY TRAFFIC CONDITION, CRIME, AND  
19:25:25 HOMELESSNESS?

19:25:30 AND SECONDLY, WHAT IS THE CITY GOING TO DO TO ENGAGE BETTER WITH THE COMMUNITY 
19:25:37 AND LET US KNOW WHEN BIG PLANS ARE COMING UP SO THAT WE CAN ENGAGE AND 
19:25:45 PROVIDE INPUT IN A TIMELY MANNER INSTEAD OF BEING NOTIFIED OF --

19:25:45 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:25:51 NEXT SPEAKER IS LISA DANZ.

19:25:53 >> HI, THANK YOU.

19:25:53 GOOD EVENING.

19:25:56 I'M A FREMONT RESIDENT AND A MEMBER OF FREMONT FOR EVERYONE.

19:26:02 AND I'M SPEAKING IN FAVOR OF VARIOUS PROJECTS THAT ARE SUPPORTING OUR 
19:26:08 HOMELESS POPULATION SUCH AS PROJECT COMPLETE AND SAFE PARKING, REITERATING 
19:26:11 MY THANKS TO COUNCIL FOR APPROVING THESE AND IN THE CASE OF PROJECT 
19:26:15 HOMEKEY, SHARING MY HOPEFUL ANTICIPATION THAT FREMONT'S GRANT 
19:26:18 APPLICATION IS ACCEPTED AND THAT THE PROJECT MOVES FORWARD SMOOTHLY AND 
19:26:19 SUCCESSFULLY.

19:26:25 I THINK THAT BOTH SIDES OF THIS DEBATE AGREE IT'S HEART-WRENCHING WHEN MANY 
19:26:27 OF OUR NEIGHBORS ARE STUCK LIVING ON THE STREET.

19:26:30 FREMONT DOES NOT HAVE ENOUGH HOMES THAT ARE AFFORDABLE TO OUR LOWER INCOME 
19:26:31 RESIDENTS.

19:26:36 WE'RE NEARING THE END OF OUR CURRENT RHNA PERIOD AND WE'RE BEHIND ON ALL OF 
19:26:37 THE LOWER INCOME CATEGORIES.

19:26:41 WE DESPERATELY NEED MORE LOWER INCOME HOUSING AND THE PROJECT HOMEKEY 
19:26:46 DELIVERS IT WITH OVER 150 UNITS OF BELOW MEDIAN INCOME HOUSING, INCLUDING 
19:26:47 VERY LOW INCOME.

19:26:50 THUS MAKING MEANINGFUL PROGRESS FOR HITTING THE TARGET.

19:26:53 THIS WILL HELP GET PEOPLE OFF THE STREET, WHICH IS BOTH BETTER FOR THE 
19:26:58 INDIVIDUALS AND THE  BETTER FOR EVERYONE WHO WALKS BY AND FEELS THEIR 
19:26:58 HEART HURT FOR THEM.

19:27:00 I'D ALSO LIKE TO ADDRESS THE SAFE PARKING PROGRAM.

19:27:05 I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO VOLUNTEER WITH THE CHECK-IN AND CHECK-OUT OF THAT, 
19:27:10 AND THE PARTICIPANTS ARE WONDERFUL, THEY'RE REALLY NICE PEOPLE, I'VE NEVER 
19:27:14 FELT UNSAFE EVEN WHEN I'M THERE AS THE ONLY VOLUNTEER WHICH SOMETIMES HAPPENS 
19:27:16 BUT THERE'S NOT ALWAYS A SECOND PERSON SIGNED UP.

19:27:20 SO I'D LIKE TO REALLY PUSH BACK AGAINST THE NOTION THAT THERE'S ANYTHING WRONG 
19:27:23 WITH PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN PRICED OUT OF THEIR HOMES.

19:27:28 WE LIVE IN A REALLY EXPENSIVE AREA AND THINGS HAPPEN IN  PEOPLE'S LIVES.

19:27:35 PEOPLE GET -- FOR ALL SORTS OF REASONS, FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOU HAVE MEDICAL DEBT 
19:27:36 AND YOU CAN'T AFFORD YOUR HOME ANYMORE.

19:27:40 SO I'D LIKE TO PEOPLE TO REMEMBER THAT THESE ARE OUR NEIGHBORS AND A LOT OF 
19:27:47 THEM ARE REALLY WONDERFUL PEOPLE AND WE NEED TO RESPECT EVERYBODY'S 
19:27:47 INDIVIDUALITY.

19:27:51 SO THANK YOU, THANKS FOR  SUPPORTING OUR UNHOUSED POPULATION.

19:27:56 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:27:59 THE NEXT SPEAKER IS T.O.D.  LANGTON.

19:28:00 WELCOME.

19:28:02 >> YES, THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK TONIGHT.

19:28:10 I'M WITH AGAPE SILICON VALLEY AND ALSO REPRESENT THE COALITION FOR THE 
19:28:12 UNHOUSED OF SILICON VALLEY.

19:28:16 VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE SWEEPS OR ABATEMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN GOING ON 
19:28:21 THROUGHOUT FREMONT AND THROUGHOUT SILICON VALLEY.

19:28:23 DO THE UNHOUSED HAVE SOMEWHERE TO GO?

19:28:32 IS THE CITY OF FREMONT PROVIDING A PLACE FOR EACH PERSON TO THAT GETS 
19:28:34 SWEPT, THAT GETS ABATED, A PLACE FOR THEM TO GO.

19:28:39 IF NOT, YOU'RE NOT IN LINE WITH THE MARTIN VERSUS BOISE SUPREME COURT 
19:28:39 DECISION.

19:28:45 THAT WAS REPLICATED UP THERE IN CHICO THIS LAST YEAR IN THE NINTH CIRCUIT 
19:28:47 COURT, WARREN VERSUS CHICO.

19:28:53 IN STATES -- IT STATES YOU CAN'T MAKE IT ILLEGAL FOR AN UNHOUSED PERSON TO 
19:28:57 SLEEP ON THE STREETS OR IN THE PARKS, AND IF SO, YOU'RE NOT IN ALIGNMENT 
19:29:00 WITH THE MARTIN VERSUS BOISE SUPREME COURT, AND THERE COULD BE MAJOR 
19:29:02 LITIGATION PROBLEMS WITH THAT.

19:29:07 I'M A BIG FAN OF SAFE PARKING AND THE PROJECT HOMEKEY, AND CAN'T EMPHASIZE 
19:29:10 ENOUGH THE NEED FOR TRANSITIONAL HOUSING.

19:29:14 WE HEAR SO MUCH ABOUT PERMANENT HOUSING, AND THE CHALLENGE WITH 
19:29:23 GETTING ENOUGH PERMANENT  HOUSING -- THE CHALLENGE WITH --

19:29:25 [INTERRUPTION]

19:29:25 >> EXCUSE ME.

19:29:29 THE CHALLENGE WITH GETTING ENOUGH PERMANENT HOUSING IS IT TAKES SO LONG 
19:29:31 TO GET THAT HOUSING BUILT.

19:29:36 TRANSITIONAL HOUSING CAN BE PUT UP IN A MATTER OF WEEKS, AND IT CAN BE VERY, 
19:29:40 VERY  COST-EFFECTIVE, 3 TO $5,000 PER UNIT.

19:29:45 AND IF YOU WANT SOME GREAT EXAMPLES OF THE TRANSITIONAL VILLAGES THAT HAVE 
19:29:48 BEEN SET UP, AND IT'S TRANSITIONAL MEANING IT'S TEMPORARY.

19:29:53 3 TO 6 MONTHS STAY FOR THAT PERSON AS THEY TRANSITION INTO PERMANENT HOUSING.

19:29:57 BUT SOME GREAT EXAMPLES OF THE TRANSITIONAL HOUSING, WE DON'T HAVE TO 
19:29:57 GO VERY FAR.

19:30:02 OAKLAND, SAN FRANCISCO, CHICO, BECAUSE OF THE LAWSUIT, THERE'S A HUGE 
19:30:06 TRANSITIONAL ENCAMPMENT GOING UP IN CHICO.

19:30:08 FRESNO, L.A., SANTA ROSA.

19:30:16 ENCOURAGE YOU TO GOOGLE IT OR GO TO THE PALATE SHELTER WEBSITE, 
19:30:18 PALLETSHELTER.COM AND YOU'LL SEE THESE CASE STUDIES FOR TRANSITIONAL HOUSING.

19:30:23 I ENCOURAGE -- I HOPE THAT YOUR FLYERS THAT YOU'RE POSTING ARE LEGAL, AND 
19:30:30 HUMANE, AND THEY CLEARLY STATE THE REASON WHY THEY'RE BEING ABATED AND 
19:30:36 WHERE AND WHAT PROPERTY THEY CAN LEAVE MIND, IF IT AN ABATEMENT VERSUS A 
19:30:43 CLEAN-UP, AND THEN WHERE CAN THEY GO, AND WILL YOU HELP THEM GET THERE?

19:30:47 THESE UNHOUSED BROTHERS AND SISTERS ARE OUR NEIGHBORS, OUR FRIENDS, AND 80% OF 
19:30:52 ALL THE UNHOUSED IN FREMONT LIVE THERE PRIOR TO BECOMING UNHOUSED.

19:30:54 AND THAT'S WHY WE CALL THEM OUR NEIGHBORS AND FRIENDS.

19:31:00 I URGE YOU TO BE HUMANE WITH THEM AND SUPPORT THEM, HELP THEM GET BACK INTO 
19:31:02 PERMANENT HOUSING AND BACK INTO A STABLE  LIFESTYLE.

19:31:02 THANK YOU.

19:31:04 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:31:06 NEXT SPEAKER IS MEENA.

19:31:09 >> HELLO, MAYOR.

19:31:12 THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK.

19:31:18 I AM PART OF THE AGAPE SILICON VALLEY AS WELL JUST LIKE TODD WHO SPOKE RIGHT 
19:31:18 BEFORE ME.

19:31:21 I'M AN ADVOCATE FOR THE UNHOUSED POPULATION HERE IN FREMONT.

19:31:25 I HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THEM AND SERVING THEM FOR OVER TWO YEARS NOW IN 
19:31:28 THE FREMONT LIBRARY AUTOMALL -- AREAS.

19:31:33 THESE ARE MY BROTHERS AND  SISTERS, AND THESE ARE MY NEIGHBORS.

19:31:40 RECENTLY WE HAVE BEEN WITNESSING UNFORTUNATELY SOME NOT SO HUMANE 
19:31:43 SWEEPS THAT HAVE BEEN HAPPENING AROUND THE LIBRARY AREA.

19:31:48 THERE HAVE BEEN ABOUT 17 OF THEM THAT I USED TO SERVE AND I KNOW HAVE WELL, 
19:31:51 AND I AM NOT ABLE TO LOCATE THEM WHICH MEANS THEY ARE THERE IN THE STREETS 
19:31:52 WHICH IS NOT SAFE FOR THEM.

19:31:58 I CANNOT URGE ENOUGH ON THE TRANSITIONAL HOUSING THAT TODD SPOKE 
19:32:03 ABOUT, PERMANENT HOUSING UNDERSTANDABLY IS CHALLENGING, AND THE PROCESS OF 
19:32:07 GETTING PLACED IN PERMANENT HOUSING WITHIN FREMONT AS I HEAR IT IS ALSO 
19:32:10 NOT VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD AND IS VERY MESSY.

19:32:15 SO A GREAT SOLUTION IN THE MEANTIME WHILE WE WORK THAT OUT WOULD BE TO 
19:32:17 HAVE TRANSITIONAL HOUSING PLANS FOR THESE INDIVIDUALS.

19:32:22 A LOT OF THESE PEOPLE THAT ARE ON THE STREETS AS I'VE SEEN IT ARE EXTREMELY 
19:32:25 TALENTED, WANT TO WORK HARD AND WANT TO GET OFF THE STREETS.

19:32:29 THEY HAVE BEEN FREMONT RESIDENTS BEFORE THEY BECAME HOMELESS, HENCE THEY ARE 
19:32:30 OUR NEIGHBORS.

19:32:36 IT IS NOT VERY HUMANE TO HAVE THEM MOVE OUT OF THEIR TENTS WITHOUT HAVING TO 
19:32:41 OFFER ANOTHER LOCATION WHERE THEY CAN BE SAFE AND CAN BE SERVED BY WITH 
19:32:45 ADVOCATES LIKE US WHO ARE ESSENTIALLY THE BRIDGE BETWEEN THEM AND YOU GUYS 
19:32:48 TO MAKE POLICY CHANGES THAT WE IMPACT THEIR LIFE POSITIVELY.

19:32:56 I REALLY HOPE THAT YOU WILL CONSIDER THIS PLEA, AND HOPEFULLY PUT AN END TO 
19:33:00 THE FUTURE SWEEPS THAT I'M HEARING ABOUT THAT IS UPCOMING IN THE AUTOMALL 
19:33:03 AREA AS WELL AS NEAR QUARRY LAKES.

19:33:03 THANK YOU.

19:33:12 >> Mayor Mei: NEXT IS ANDREAS KADANAVICH.

19:33:13 WELCOME, ANDREAS.

19:33:18 >> GOOD EVENING.

19:33:22 ANDREAS KADANAVICH IS BIKE FREMONT.

19:33:25 YOU HEARD A COUPLE COMMENTS ABOUT TRAFFIC TODAY WHICH BROUGHT BACK A 
19:33:29 MEMORY FROM THE CENTERVILLE DISCUSSION A FEW WEEKS BACK, WHERE ONE OF THE 
19:33:34 COUNSELORS ASKED WHY THE COUNCIL HAD NOT RECEIVED A RECOMMENDATION FROM THE 
19:33:34 MOBILITY COMMISSION.

19:33:39 AND STAFF RESPONDED THAT THAT'S NOT REALLY THE PURPOSE OF THE COMMISSION 
19:33:43 AND THAT THEY DON'T REALLY HAVE ENOUGH TIME IN THEIR MEETING SCHEDULE TO 
19:33:43 ADDRESS  THIS.

19:33:49 AND I WANTED TO PROVIDE AN ALTERNATE VIEWPOINT TO THAT RESPONSE, AND I WILL 
19:33:55 BE QUOTING FROM FREMONT MUNICIPAL CODE HERE, SECTION 22700.

19:34:00 THE MOBILITY COMMISSION SHALL ACT IN AN ADVISORY CAPACITY TO THE CITY COUNCIL 
19:34:04 AND SHALL HAVE THE FOLLOWING DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES, FUNCTIONS AND 
19:34:04 OBJECTIVES.

19:34:09 SECTION E, PROVIDE INPUT ON THE PREPARATION OF NEW AND UPDATED 
19:34:12 TRANSPORTATION POLICIES, PLANS AND PROJECTS.

19:34:16 F, PROVIDE A FORUM TO RECEIVE PUBLIC COMMENT ON MOBILITY TOPICS.

19:34:22 G, AT THE REQUEST OF THE CITY COUNCIL, THE MOBILITY COMMISSION MAY PERFORM 
19:34:25 OTHER ADVISORY FUNCTIONS NOT NOTED ABOVE.

19:34:30 SECTION 226.90, THE MOBILITY COMMISSION SHALL MEET QUARTERLY.

19:34:33 A SUBGROUP OF THE COMMISSION MAY CONVENE ADDITIONAL WORKING GROUP 
19:34:38 MEETINGS AND MAY RELY ON COMMUNITY GROUPS TO WORK ON FOCUSED TOPICS OF 
19:34:41 INTEREST RELATED TO SPECIAL PROJECTS AND PROGRAMS.

19:34:48 WHICH TO SUMMARIZE, A, THERE IS, IN FACT, THE PURPOSE OF THE MOBILITY 
19:34:52 COMMISSION TO ADVISE COUNCIL ON TOPICS.

19:34:59 IF YOU DEEM IT OF INTEREST TO YOU, YOU JUST LET THE MOBILITY COMMISSION KNOW, 
19:35:02 YOU CAN LET THEM KNOW AHEAD OF TIME ON MAJOR ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN BONES OF 
19:35:07 CONTENTION FOR A LONG TIME OR CERTAINLY ANYTHING THAT GENERATES 400 SURVEY 
19:35:08 RESPONSES, YOU MAY WANT TO CONSIDER THAT AS WELL.

19:35:13 AND ALSO, THERE IS, IN FACT, THE PROVISION TO HAVE MORE FREQUENT 
19:35:20 MEETINGS OF SUBGROUPS, AND I WILL POINT OUT THAT ACTUALLY NO SUBGROUPS HAVE 
19:35:20 MET IN OVER SIX MONTHS.

19:35:24 WE'RE ACTUALLY DUE FOR  SOMETHING.

19:35:28 SO IF YOU IN FACT WANT THE MOBILITY COMMISSION'S INPUT, FOR INSTANCE, ON 
19:35:33 THE UPCOMING DISCUSSION ON THE PASEO PADRE STREETWAY DESIGN, ALL YOU HAVE 
19:35:35 TO DO IS ASK.

19:35:40 IF YOU ACTUALLY THINK THAT THIS IS IMPORTANT ENOUGH FOR THE MOBILITY 
19:35:46 COMMISSION TO MEET MORE OFTEN THAN QUARTERLY, YOU DO, IN FACT, HAVE THE 
19:35:49 OPTION TO AMEND THE CITY CODE TO SAY SO.

19:35:49 THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

19:35:53 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU,  ANDREAS.

19:35:53 APPRECIATE THAT.

19:36:04 AT THIS TIME, WE CLOSE -- I'M TRYING TO MAKE SURE I HAVE NO OTHER PUBLIC 
19:36:05 SPEAKERS.

19:36:09 AT THIS TIME, I WILL -- WAIT, COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN?

19:36:15 FOR A PUBLIC SPEAKER OR --

19:36:16 >> Councilmember Kassan: SORRY.

19:36:27 I WOULD WOULD REQUEST THAT -- ITEMS BE AGENDIZED AT A FUTURE MEETING AS SOON 
19:36:28 AS POSSIBLE.

19:36:36 NUMBER ONE IS HOW DECISIONS ARE BEING MADE ABOUT TRANSPORTATION CHANGES AND 
19:36:40 HOW THE MOBILITY COMMISSION IS INVOLVED IN THAT AND HOW THE SURVEYS ARE BEING 
19:36:45 DONE, AND NUMBER TWO, CHANGES IN HOW WE'RE DEALING WITH OUR  HOMELESS 
19:36:52 POPULATION AND THESE ABATEMENT EFFORTS AND WHAT EFFECTS THEY'RE HAVING AND 
19:36:57 HOW THEY RELATE TO THE BOISE DECISION AND HOW WE'RE ENSURING THAT WE'RE 
19:36:57 STAYING WITHIN THE LAW.

19:37:10 >> Mayor Mei: I THINK WE'LL TURN THAT OVER -- I DON'T KNOW IF  OUR -- I'M 
19:37:14 LOOKING FOR RAFAEL OR CITY MANAGER WOULD LIKE TO COMMENT ON IT, BUT WE'VE 
19:37:15 DULY NOTED THE REQUEST.

19:37:21 >> City Mgr. Shackelford: YES, THE REQUESTS ARE NOTED.

19:37:28 THOSE WOULD BE COUNCIL  REFERRALS, AND SO THERE'S A PROCESS FOR SUBMITTING 
19:37:35 THOSE AND THAT CAN CONTACT COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN OFFLINE AND WE 
19:37:36 CAN GET THOSE AGENDIZED.

19:37:38  AS REFERRALS.

19:37:39 >> Mayor Mei: GREAT.
THANK YOU.

19:37:44 APPRECIATE IT, ESPECIALLY SINCE WE'RE DOING PASEO PADRE, IT MIGHT BE GOOD 
19:37:45 TIMING.

19:37:50 AND I'M SURE WE HAVE STAFF  THAT -- UNDER THE DIRECTION OF THE CITY 
19:37:55 MANAGER WHO ARE  ADVISORS TO THAT COMMITTEE, THE COMMISSION.

19:37:56 THANK YOU.

19:38:13 NEXT ON OUR AGENDA ITEM THIS EVENING IS ITEM 7, WHICH IS THE FISCAL YEAR 
19:38:14 2021/2022 MID-YEAR BUDGET REPORT.

19:38:19 AND WE WILL HAVE A PRESENTATION FROM OUR FINANCE DIRECTOR, DAVID PERSSELIN.

19:38:21 WELCOME.

19:38:24 >> Mr. Persselin: THANKS, MADAME MAYOR.

19:38:31 TONIGHT I'LL BE PRESENTING A BRIEF REVIEW OF RECENT ECONOMIC AND REVENUE 
19:38:38 TRENDS, DISCUSS REVISED GENERAL FUND REVENUE PROJECTIONS FOR THE CURRENT  
19:38:41 YEAR, PROVIDE A PRELIMINARY GENERAL FUND FORECAST FOR THE NEXT THREE 
19:38:44 YEARS, AND PRESENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR MID-YEAR BUDGET ADJUSTMENTS.

19:38:50 SO THIS SLIDE IS SUMMARIZING WHAT I'LL BE TALKING ABOUT TONIGHT.

19:38:59 THE NATIONAL ECONOMY IS CONTINUING TO RECOVER, AND GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT, 
19:39:04 THE PRIMARY INDICATOR OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITY, IS EXPECTED TO GROW AT A 
19:39:05 HEALTHY RATE DURING 2022.

19:39:11 HOWEVER, PANDEMIC-RELATED SUPPLY CHAIN DISRUPTIONS COMBINED WITH STRONG 
19:39:16 DEMAND PROMPTED BY FISCAL STIMULUS PROGRAMS AND PROMPTED UNUSUALLY HIGH 
19:39:19 LEVELS OF INFLATION THAT COULD DISCOURAGE NEW BUSINESS INVESTMENT.

19:39:23 ADDITIONALLY, THE IMPOSITION OF SANCTIONS IN RESPONSE TO THE RUSSIAN 
19:39:27 INNOVATION OF UKRAINE WILL LIKELY FURTHER DISRUPT INTERNATIONAL TRADE.

19:39:34 OVERALL, OUR PRELIMINARY REVENUE FORECAST ASSUMES SUSTAINED ECONOMIC 
19:39:38 GROWTH, BUT WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT WE STILL FACE SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY.

19:39:44 THIS YEAR'S ADOPTED BUDGET WAS DEVELOPED LAST SPRING, AS WE EMERGED 
19:39:50 FROM THE DECEMBER 2020 SURGE IN COVID CASES AND VACCINES WERE JUST BECOMING 
19:39:50  WIDELY AVAILABLE.

19:39:57 OUR REVENUE PROJECTIONS ASSUMED A GRADUAL RECOVERY, WITH CERTAIN SECTORS 
19:39:59 OF THE LOCAL ECONOMY REMAINING DEPRESSED.

19:40:05 INSTEAD, WE'VE EXPERIENCED UNPRECEDENTED GROWTH IN SEVERAL OF OUR 
19:40:11 MAJOR REVENUES, WITH SALES TAX REVENUE PARTICULARLY AFFECTED BY WHAT IS 
19:40:14 LIKELY A TEMPORARY SURGE IN NEW AUTO SALES.

19:40:24 I'LL START BY POINTING OUT THAT FISCAL RECOVERY FUNDS OF $20 MILLION RECEIVED 
19:40:30 IN FISCAL YEAR 2020-21 ARE INCLUDED IN THE OTHER REVENUE CATEGORY.

19:40:37 $22.1MILLION OF FISCAL RECOVERY FUNDS ANTICIPATED TO BE RECEIVED LATER THIS 
19:40:41 YEAR ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE CURRENT-YEAR ESTIMATE, BUT WILL SHOW 
19:40:45 UP ON THE PRELIMINARY FORECAST SLIDE FOR NEXT FISCAL YEAR.

19:40:51 THE STRONG LOCAL REAL ESTATE MARKET IS PROJECTED TO GENERATE HISTORICALLY 
19:40:55 HIGH LEVELS OF PROPERTY TRANSFER TAX FOR THIS FISCAL YEAR.

19:41:03 INCLUDED IN THE OTHER CATEGORY AND BOOST PROPERTY TAX REVENUE NEXT YEAR.

19:41:07 OUR CURRENT BUDGET FOR PROPERTY TAX INCLUDED AN ASSUMPTION BASED ON 
19:41:11 GUIDANCE FROM THE COUNTY ASSESSOR'S OFFICE THAT A PORTION OF OUR BUSINESS 
19:41:15 PROPERTY ASSESSMENT WOULD BE REDUCED TO REFLECT THE IMPACT OF LAST  YEAR'S 
19:41:16 PUBLIC HEALTH RESTRICTIONS.

19:41:23 THAT REDUCTION DID NOT OCCUR, WHICH EXPLAINS MOST OF THE $1.3 MILLION 
19:41:27 REVENUE VARIANCE YOU SEE IN THE FAR RIGHT COLUMN ON THE SLIDE FOR PROPERTY 
19:41:27 TAX.

19:41:31 THE BIG STORY IS SALES TAX.

19:41:41 THROUGH THE FIRST TWO QUARTERS OF THE YEAR, WE'VE RECEIVE  OVER $44 MILLION 
19:41:43 OF TAX REVENUE, ABOUT $15 MILLION MORE THAN WE ANTICIPATED.

19:41:48 MOST OF THAT CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO WHAT IS LIKELY A TEMPORARY SURGE IN NEW 
19:41:53 AUTO SALES, SIMILAR TO THE TEMPORARY SURGE WE EXPERIENCED IN FISCAL YEAR 
19:41:54  2018-19.

19:42:00 ALONG WITH SOME ONE-TIME  PRIOR-YEAR ADJUSTMENTS FROM THE STATE.

19:42:05 BECAUSE OUR SHARE OF COUNTY  POOLED SALES TAX REVENUES IS BASED ON OUR 
19:42:10 SHARE OF COUNTYWIDE LOCAL SALES TAX REVENUES, WE'RE SEEING UNUSUALLY HIGH 
19:42:12 LEVELS OF REVENUE IN THAT POOL CATEGORY AS WELL.

19:42:20 IN TOTAL, WE'RE PROJECTING TO RECEIVE OVER $21 MILLION MORE IN SALES TAX 
19:42:22 REVENUE THIS YEAR THAN WE BUDGETED.

19:42:28 ALTHOUGH MORE THAN HALF OF THAT IS PROBABLY ONE TIME IN NATURE, A 
19:42:34 SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT IS BEING CARRIED FORWARD IN OUR PRELIMINARY REVENUE ESTIMATE.

19:42:38 WE'RE SEEING A MORE RAPID THAN ANTICIPATED RECOVERY IN BUSINESS TAX 
19:42:42 REVENUE, ENHANCED BY THE PAYMENT OF PRIOR-YEAR TAXES DELAYED BY THE 
19:42:43 PANDEMIC.

19:42:49 ALTHOUGH HOTEL TAX REVENUE CONTINUES TO FALL BELOW ITS  PEAK, YEAR-TO-DATE 
19:42:56 COLLECTIONS SUGGEST WE'LL EXCEED THE BUDGET ESTIMATE BY ABOUT $1 MILLION.

19:43:00 THE $900,000 INCREASE IN ESTIMATED CHARGES FOR SERVICES REF NEWELL IS 
19:43:06 LARGELY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE AGREEMENT WHICH FREMONT UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT 
19:43:10 FOR THE SCHOOL RESOURCE OFFICER PROGRAM THAT WAS NEGOTIATED AFTER THE BUDGET 
19:43:11 WAS ADOPTED.

19:43:18 AS I NOTED EARLIER, ABOUT HALF OF THE VARIANCE IN THE OTHER CATEGORY RELATES 
19:43:20 TO PROPERTY TRANSFER TAX.

19:43:25 THE OTHER HALF OF THE VARIANTS COMES FROM TRAFFIC FINES THAT HAVE QUICKLY 
19:43:28 CLIMB BACK TO THEIR PRE-PANDEMIC LEVEL.

19:43:32 IN TOTAL, GENERAL FUND REVENUES ARE PROJECTED TO FINISH THE YEAR 
19:43:37 APPROXIMATELY $31 MILLION ABOVE THE ADOPTED BUDGET ESTIMATE.

19:43:50 THE FIRST COLUMN ON THIS SLIDE SHOWS THE ACTUAL REVENUES AND EXPENDITURES 
19:43:51 FOR LAST FISCAL YEAR.

19:43:55 THE REVENUES ROW INCLUDES $20 MILLION OF FISCAL RECOVERY FUNDS THAT 
19:44:00 CONSTITUTES MOST OF THE UNRESERVED FUND BALANCE YOU SEE AS A SOURCE OF FUNDS 
19:44:04 FOR THE CURRENT-YEAR BUDGET IN THE SECOND COLUMN.

19:44:09 WE USE THOSE FISCAL RECOVERY FUNDS TO BALANCE THE CURRENT YEAR'S BUDGET, 
19:44:14 WHICH ALLOWED US TO RESTORE MOST OF THE EXPENDITURE REDUCTIONS FROM THE 
19:44:14 PREVIOUS YEAR.

19:44:19 THAT'S WHY YOU SEE A $20 MILLION INCREASE IN THE EXPENDITURES ROW.

19:44:26 BECAUSE WE FINISHED LAST FISCAL YEAR WITH SOME UNANTICIPATED FUND BALANCE, 
19:44:31 AS PART OF THE YEAR END REPORT, THE CITY COUNCIL WAS ABLE TO RESTORE AND 
19:44:37 INCREASE THE BUDGET UNCERTAINTY RESERVE, WHICH CONSTITUTES MOST OF THE 
19:44:43 $7.5 MILLION ADDITION TO RESERVES IN THE CURRENT YEAR BUDGET COLUMN.

19:44:49 WAS THE BUDGET WAS ADOPTED, WE LEFT ABOUT $900,000 AS  UNRESERVED FUND 
19:44:52 BALANCE SINCE WE HADN'T YET CLOSED THE BOOKS ON THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR.

19:44:59 THE $246 MILLION OF REVENUE SHOWN IN THE FAR RIGHT ESTIMATE COLUMN 
19:45:02 CORRESPONDS TO THE TOTAL SHOWN ON THE PREVIOUS SLIDE.

19:45:06 A $31 MILLION INCREASE FROM THE BUDGET AMOUNT.

19:45:12 YOU MAY RECALL THAT WE INCLUDE IN THE EXPENDITURE BUDGET A  SAVINGS 
19:45:18 ASSUMPTION TO REFLECT THE CITY'S HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE OF UNDERSPENDING 
19:45:22 TOTAL KATEED RESOURCES, PRIMARILY DUE TO SALARY SAVINGS FROM VACANT 
19:45:23 POSITIONS.

19:45:33 THIS YEAR'S SAVING ASSUMPTION WAS $6 MILLION, BUT AT MID YEAR WE'RE ON 
19:45:36 TRACK TO SEE MORE THAN TWICE THAT SAVINGS DUE TO AN UNUSUALLY HIGH AND 
19:45:37 PERSISTENT LEVEL OF VACANCIES.

19:45:44 THE COMBINATION OF INCREASED REVENUES AND ADDITIONAL SAVINGS TOTALS $37.9 
19:45:44 MILLION.

19:45:50 THESE ESTIMATES WILL CHANGE AS THE FISCAL YEAR PROGRESSES AND WE RECEIVE 
19:45:53 MORE REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE INFORMATION.

19:46:03 AS A REMINDER, THE CITY COUNCIL HAS ESTABLISHED TWO GENERAL FUND RESERVES.

19:46:14 THE CONTINGENCY RESERVE FUNDED BY COUNCIL POLICY AT 16.7% IS INTENDED TO 
19:46:18 MITIGATE THE EFFECTS OF NATURAL DISASTERS AND OTHER SEVERE, UNFORESEEN 
19:46:19 EVENTS.

19:46:24 THE BUDGET UNCERTAINTY RESERVE IS INTENDED TO OFFSET REVENUE SHORT FALLS 
19:46:29 AND UNANTICIPATED COST INCREASES, WITH THE GOAL OF PROVIDING SUFFICIENT 
19:46:34 RESOURCES TO MAINTAIN SERVICE LEVELS WHILE GIVING THE CITY AN OPPORTUNITY 
19:46:35 TO RESPOND TO ITS BUDGETARY CHALLENGES.

19:46:41 WE MADE USE OF THIS RESERVE DURING THE INITIAL PHASE OF THE PANDEMIC TO 
19:46:43 PREVENT SERVICE DISRUPTIONS.

19:46:48 AS I MENTIONED ON THE LAST  SLIDE, THE CITY COUNCIL WAS ABLE TO RESTORE AND 
19:46:53 INCREASE THE BUDGET UNCERTAINTY RESERVE TO $10 MILLION AS PART OF THE FISCAL 
19:46:56 YEAR 2020-21 YEAR-END REPORT.

19:47:05 THE PRELIMINARY GENERAL FUND FORECAST SHOWN ON THIS SLIDE INCLUDES THE 
19:47:11 CURRENT-YEAR ESTIMATE I JUST DISCUSSED ALONG WITH PROJECTIONS FOR THE NEXT 
19:47:11 THREE FISCAL YEARS.

19:47:17 REVENUE PROJECTIONS FOR THE NEXT THREE FISCAL YEARS ARE BASED ON THE MOST 
19:47:21 CURRENT INFORMATION AVAILABLE AND TAKE INTO ACCOUNT HISTORICAL TRENDS, 
19:47:27 CURRENT-YEAR PERFORMANCE THROUGH MID YEAR, PROJECTED DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY, 
19:47:29 AND SCHEDULED CHANGES IN VARIOUS FEES AND RATES.

19:47:34 THESE PRELIMINARY PROJECTIONS ARE BASED ON THE EXPECTATION THAT ECONOMIC 
19:47:35 CONDITIONS WILL CONTINUE TO IMPROVE.

19:47:41 BUT ASSUME THAT HOTEL OCCUPANCY RATES REMAIN BELOW THEIR HISTORICAL LEVELS.

19:47:48 AS I MENTIONED EARLIER, THE SECOND INSTALLMENT OF FISCAL RECOVERY FUNDS, 
19:47:54 $22.1 MILLION, IS INCLUDED IN THE FISCAL YEAR 2022-23 REVENUE ESTIMATE.

19:48:02 THE EXPENDITURE PROJECTIONS ARE NET OF ESTIMATED CITY-WIDE  SAVINGS OF $6 
19:48:07 MILLION IN EACH YEAR, AND INCLUDE ADJUSTMENTS TO REFLECT CALPERS PENSION 
19:48:13 CONTRIBUTION INCREASES, HIGHER RETIREE HEALTH CONTRIBUTIONS, SCHEDULED DEBT 
19:48:15 SERVICE PAYMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS.

19:48:20 IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CITY COUNCIL'S PENSION LIABILITY FUNDING POLICY, AN 
19:48:24 ADDITIONAL PENSION CONTRIBUTION HAS BEEN INCLUDED IN EACH YEAR AS WELL.

19:48:32 AS THIS FORECAST IS PRELIMINARY, THE EXPENDITURES SHOWN REPRESENT A BASE 
19:48:37 BUDGET THAT DELIVERS THE EXISTING LEVEL OF SERVICES WITH NO ASSUMED 
19:48:40 COMPENSATION OR  STAFFING INCREASES.

19:48:46 THESE EXPENDITURE LEVELS MAY INCREASE AS THE FISCAL YEAR 2022-23 PROPOSED 
19:48:52 OPERATING BUDGET IS DEVELOPED WITH THE BENEFIT OF ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, 
19:48:54 INCLUDING ANY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR SERVICE LEVEL ENHANCEMENTS.

19:49:02 AS YOU CAN SEE, REVENUES SIGNIFICANTLY EXCEED EXPENDITURES IN EACH OF THE 
19:49:03 FORECAST YEARS.

19:49:07 I'D LIKE TO REMIND THE COUNCIL, HOWEVER, THAT THIS PRELIMINARY 
19:49:14 FORECAST DOES NOT INCORPORATE SPENDING INCREASES FOR NECESSARY PARKS AND 
19:49:18 BUILDINGS MAINTENANCE, ADDITIONAL PUBLIC SAFETY  STAFFING, OR LABOR 
19:49:21 AGREEMENTS TO BE NEGOTIATED OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL MONTHS.

19:49:31 AT THE CITY COUNCIL RETREAT LAST MONTH, WE REVIEWED A LIST OF CRITICAL 
19:49:33 MAINTENANCE AND CAPITAL REPLACEMENT NEEDS.

19:49:37 AS WELL AS UNFUNDED FUTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS.

19:49:41 THESE INCLUDE MAJOR CITY INITIATIVES SUCH AS THE PARKS MASTER PLAN AND THE 
19:49:47 CLIMATE ACTION PLAN, BUT ALSO TRAFFIC SIGNAL MODERNIZATION, REPLACEMENT OF 
19:49:52 DETERIORATING COMMUNITY FACILITIES IN CENTRAL PARK AND TECHNOLOGY UPGRADES.

19:49:56 ALTHOUGH THE COMBINED COST OF THESE UNFUNDED NEEDS FAR EXCEEDS THE 
19:50:02 RESOURCES AVAILABLE, THE UNANTICIPATED INCREASE IN CURRENT YEAR REVENUE IS 
19:50:06 CREATING AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE PROGRESS ON THE HIGHEST PRIORITY 
19:50:07  PROJECTS.

19:50:13 THE CURRENT SALES TAX PROJECTION BASED ON TWO QUARTERS OF ACTUAL RECEIPTS IS 
19:50:17 EXCEEDING THE BUDGETED ESTIMATE BY $21.8 MILLION.

19:50:23 ALL OTHER REVENUE CATEGORIES COMBINED ARE PROJECTED TO EXCEED THE ESTIMATE 
19:50:30 BY $9.2 MILLION, AND OUR EXPENDITURES ARE PROJECTED TO FALL $6.9 MILLION 
19:50:31 BELOW BUDGET.

19:50:37 FOR SIMPLICITY, STAFF RECOMMENDS THAT THE CITY COUNCIL INCREASE THE REVENUE 
19:50:42 ESTIMATE FOR SALES TAX BY $21.8 MILLION, WHILE LEAVING THE ESTIMATES 
19:50:46 FOR THE OTHER REVENUES AND EXPENDITURES AT THEIR ADOPTED LEVELS.

19:50:52 STAFF ADDITIONALLY RECOMMENDS THAT THE CITY COUNCIL APPROPRIATE THAT $21.8 
19:50:56 MILLION OF ADDITIONAL REVENUE AS A TRANSFER TO THE CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS 
19:50:56 FUND.

19:51:06 TO RECAP, THE NATIONAL ECONOMY IS RECOVERING AND MOST OF OUR GENERAL 
19:51:08 REVENUES ARE GROWING AT A HEALTHY PACE.

19:51:14 THE CURRENT YEAR COMBINATION OF HIGHER THAN ANTICIPATED REVENUE AND 
19:51:18 EXPENDITURE SAVINGS IS PROVIDING US WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO SET ASIDE 
19:51:23 FUNDING FOR CRITICAL MAINTENANCE AND CAPITAL REPLACEMENT NEEDS, AS WELL AS 
19:51:25 UNFUNDED FUTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS.

19:51:31 CONSEQUENTLY, STAFF RECOMMENDS THAT THE CITY COUNCIL INCREASE THE CURRENT-YEAR 
19:51:36 REVENUE ESTIMATE FOR SALES TAX BY $21.8 MILLION AND IMPROVE THE TRANSFER OF 
19:51:38 THAT AMOUNT TO THE CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS FUND.

19:51:48 WE ANTICIPATE PRESENTING THE FISCAL YEAR 2022-23 PROPOSED OPERATING BUDGET 
19:51:52 TO THE CITY COUNCIL ON MAY 17TH.

19:51:55 THE FIRST PUBLIC HEARING ON THE PROPOSED OPERATING BUDGET WILL BE HELD 
19:51:59 ON JUNE 7TH, WITH THE SECOND PUBLIC HEARING AND BUDGET ADOPTION SCHEDULED 
19:52:01 FOR  JUNE 14TH.

19:52:03 THAT COMPLETES MY PRESENTATION.

19:52:07 I'LL TURN THE MEETING BACK OVER TO THE MAYOR AND I'M READY TO TAKE YOUR 
19:52:07 QUESTIONS.

19:52:15 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:52:18 AT THIS TIME, I'D LIKE TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY CLARIFYING QUESTIONS FROM 
19:52:18 OUR COUNCIL.

19:52:26 CLARIFYING QUESTIONS FROM VICE MAYOR SALWAN.

19:52:29 >> Vice Mayor Salwan: THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR, AND THANK YOU, MR. PERSSELIN, 
19:52:30 FOR THE PRESENTATION.

19:52:37 SO I UNDERSTAND THE TWO STEPS, ONE IS TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF SALES TAX, 
19:52:42 AND THE SECOND IS TO APPROPRIATE IT FOR CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS.

19:52:47 SO IN THE PAST, WE'VE HAD A LIST LIKE THESE ARE THE FIVE THINGS THAT WE'RE 
19:52:48 GOING TO PUT THE MONEY TOWARDS.

19:52:53 HOW DO WE DECIDE WHERE THIS FUNDING SPECIFICALLY GOES IN THE CAPITAL 
19:52:55 IMPROVEMENT PROJECT?

19:52:58 WILL WE HAVE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS THAT OR HAVE SOME RECOMMENDATIONS FROM 
19:52:59 STAFF?

19:53:02 >> Mr. Persselin: ABSOLUTELY.

19:53:07 SO WE'RE NOT ASKING COUNCIL TO MAKE SPECIFIC ALLOCATIONS TO PROJECTS 
19:53:12 TONIGHT, AND IN FACT, THE NEXT TIME THAT WE'LL BE REALLY LOOKING AT THAT 
19:53:17 WILL BE IN DEVELOPMENT OF THE NEXT CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT PLAN, WHICH BEGINS 
19:53:18 IN THE FALL.

19:53:24 SO WE'LL BE RETURNING TO COUNCIL WITH RECOMMENDATIONS AS PART OF THE CAPITAL 
19:53:30 IMPROVEMENT PLAN, AND IT MAY BE THE CASE THAT TO THE EXTENT THAT WE HAVE 
19:53:34 PROJECTS THAT ARE READY TO COME FORWARD TO COUNCIL FOR APPROVAL, WE WOULD MAKE 
19:53:37 RECOMMENDATIONS RELATED TO THOSE AT THAT TIME.

19:53:42 >> Vice Mayor Salwan: AND I THINK YOU MENTIONED IT SOMEWHERE EITHER HERE OR 
19:53:47 PREVIOUS PRESENTATION, BUT WE ARE INCREASING OUR UNFUNDED PENSION 
19:53:54 PAYMENT AS WELL, IS THAT  CORRECT, IN THE OPEC CONTRIBUTIONS?

19:53:55 >> Mr. Persselin: THAT'S  CORRECT.

19:54:00 SO THE PROJECTION WE SHOWED INCLUDES THE ADDITIONAL CONTRIBUTIONS FOR 
19:54:04 PENSION UNFUNDED LIABILITY THAT ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE CITY COUNCIL 
19:54:06 POLICY.

19:54:08 >> Vice Mayor Salwan: GREAT.

19:54:09 THANK YOU.

19:54:10 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:54:13 CLARIFYING QUESTIONS, COUNCILMEMBER SHAO.

19:54:16 >> Councilmember Shao: THANK YOU, MADAME MAYOR.

19:54:21 THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION, MR. PERSSELIN.

19:54:24 MY QUESTION IS REGARDING THE EXPENSES.

19:54:38 RIGHT NOW WE EXPERIENCE SPIKES IN FUEL COSTS AMONG OTHER COSTS, SO IN YOUR 
19:54:44 COMPILATION FOR EXPENSE, HAVE YOU TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION IN YOUR CALCULATION 
19:54:48 THE INFLATION  FACTOR?

19:54:50 >> Mr. Persselin: COUNCILMEMBER SHAO, THE FUEL COSTS FOR THE CITY ARE 
19:54:58 ROUGHLY IN THE $1 MILLION A YEAR RANGE, SO TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE'S 
19:55:03 SIGNIFICANT INFLATION, THAT'S PROBABLY ON THE ORDER OF $100,000.

19:55:09 SO I'M NOT EXPLICITLY TAKING THAT INTO ACCOUNT IN THIS  MID-YEAR BUDGET 
19:55:13 REPORT, IN PART BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T ACTUALLY EXPERIENCED THOSE COSTS YET, 
19:55:20 BUT IN PART BECAUSE THOSE ADDITIONAL COSTS WOULD BE SWAMPED BY THE 
19:55:24 EXTREMELY LARGE VACANCY SAVINGS THAT WE'RE CURRENTLY SEEING.

19:55:30 WHEN WE COME BACK WITH THE PROPOSED OPERATING BUDGET IN MAY, WE WILL ALSO 
19:55:37 BE PRESENTING A REVISED FORECAST BOTH FOR THE CURRENT YEAR AND FOR THE  
19:55:47 OUTYEARS, AND AT THAT POINT, WE MAY TAKE INTO ACCOUNT ADDITIONAL HIGHER 
19:55:48 INCREASES FOR FUEL COSTS.

19:55:51 >> Councilmember Shao: THANK  YOU.

19:55:53 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU FOR THE CLARIFYING QUESTIONS.

19:56:02 AND AT THIS TIME, I ALSO WANTED TO SEE IF THERE'S CLARIFYING QUESTIONS FROM 
19:56:02 THE ATTENDANTS.

19:56:04 I SEE MARIE H. HAS RAISED HER HAND.

19:56:08 >> THIS ISN'T A CLARIFYING QUESTION.

19:56:11 I JUST WANTED TO MAKE A --

19:56:13 >> Mayor Mei: MAKE A COMMENT, MY APOLOGIES ON THAT.

19:56:17 >> MARIE HUGHES AGAIN, RESIDENT OF FREMONT FOR GOING ON 28 YEARS NOW.

19:56:20 FIRST I WANT TO SAY THAT I'M EXCITED THAT WE HAVE A BUDGET SURPLUS.

19:56:23 IT'S NICE TO GET GOOD NEWS FOR A CHANGE.

19:56:29 NOW I UNDERSTAND WHY WE WANT THIS MONEY INTO THE CAPITAL RESERVE FUND, 
19:56:33 HOWEVER, I URGE YOU TO CONSIDER TO GIVE SOME OF TO THE HUMAN SERVICES 
19:56:36 DEPARTMENT IN ORDER TO ACCELERATE SOME OF THE CITY'S HOMELESSNESS 
19:56:36 INITIATIVES.

19:56:42 HOMELESSNESS HAS ACCELERATED DURING THE PANDEMIC, SO THE RESOURCES WE HAVE TO 
19:56:45 COMBAT IT NEED TO BE ACCELERATED TOO.

19:56:52 SURELY A SMALL FRACTION OF THAT $21.8 MILLION COULD BE USED FOR THIS PURPOSE.

19:56:58 EVEN JUST SHAVING OFF THE $.8 MILLION WOULD BE AN ENORMOUS BENEFIT AND WOULD 
19:56:59 HAVE AN ENORMOUS IMPACT.

19:57:01 THAT'S IT.

19:57:02 THAT'S MY COMMENT.

19:57:05 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

19:57:15 AND I SEE NO OTHER SPEAKERS SO I'M GOING TO CLOSE THE PUBLIC COMMENT 
19:57:19 PERIOD FOR THE BUDGET AND I'LL TURN IT BACK TO COUNCIL FOR THEIR COMMENTS IF 
19:57:23 THERE'S ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS OR ELSE I HAVE SOME COMMENTS ON THIS.

19:57:29 SEEING NONE, OKAY.

19:57:35 I WAS JUST GOING TO SAY, I DEFINITELY WOULD ECHO SOME OF THE FEEDBACK THAT 
19:57:38 WE'VE HEARD THIS EVENING FROM PUBLIC COMMENT REGARDING HOMELESSNESS, AND 
19:57:42 THAT'S WHY I KNOW THAT SUZANNE SHENFIL WAS ON THERE EARLIER, AND RIGHT NOW 
19:57:46 THERE IS THE HOME TOGETHER PLAN AND OTHER EFFORTS THAT ARE COMING ACROSS 
19:57:52 FROM THE COUNTY, AND AS WE HAD JUST HAD OUR COUNCIL RETREAT AND  HOMELESSNESS 
19:57:56 IS NOTED AS ONE OF THE KEY AREAS AND PRIORITIES FOR THE COUNCIL, WE ARE 
19:57:59 LOOKING AT GETTING FEEDBACK ON THAT.

19:58:03 ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WHETHER IT COMES TO MOVING FORWARD, WE HAVE THE 
19:58:08 EXISTING PROGRAMS WHICH WE WOULD NEED TO MAINTAIN OPERATIONS FOR, AND THAT'S 
19:58:14 ONE THING, LIKE OUR CLEAN START MOBILE HYGIENE UNIT, OUR HOUSING NAVIGATION 
19:58:18 CENTER, AND THEN THE OTHER PIECE IS THAT IF WE'RE TRYING TO SECURE 
19:58:22 ADDITIONAL PROJECTS IN THE FUTURE MOVING FORWARD, PART OF THE HOME 
19:58:29 TOGETHER PLAN REQUIRES SOME INVESTMENT FROM LOCAL MUNICIPALITIES TO BE ABLE 
19:58:31 TO SECURE COUNTY AND ADDITIONAL FUNDS.

19:58:36 SO HOPEFULLY THAT'S SOMETHING WE CAN COBBLE AND BE ABLE TO, I GUESS, 
19:58:40 INCREASE THE BENEFITS WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT WHAT TYPES OF PROPOSALS 
19:58:43 WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS AS WE LOOK THROUGH THE PLAN, AND THEN I DON'T 
19:58:47 KNOW  IF -- I'M SURE ALL THE DEPARTMENTS ARE ALSO WORKING WITH US 
19:58:52 CLOSELY ON THAT, AND I KNOW THAT WE HAVE OUR COMMUNITY BLOCK DEVELOPMENT 
19:58:55 GRANTS AND OTHER OPPORTUNITIES TO BE ABLE TO COBBLE SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS 
19:58:56 TOGETHER.

19:58:59 THE OTHER AREA THAT I THINK YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IS ABOUT CAPITAL 
19:59:04 IMPROVEMENT PLANS, AND WHEN IT COMES TO THOSE TYPES OF PROJECTS, WE ARE AT A 
19:59:07 MOMENT WHERE WE'RE HAVING TRANSFORMATIONAL INVESTMENT IN TERMS 
19:59:13 OF INFRASTRUCTURE DOLLARS FROM FEDERAL AND OTHER OPPORTUNITIES ON 
19:59:19 TRANSPORTATION, ON BROADBAND AND OTHER INITIATIVES, AND I'M HOPING THAT WE 
19:59:25 ARE BEING THOUGHTFUL IN TRYING TO SECURE -- I KNOW I HAVE TO THANK DAVID 
19:59:28 -- DIRECTOR PERSSELIN, YOU AND YOUR STAFF ALWAYS IN BEING THOUGHTFUL IN 
19:59:28 THAT AREA.

19:59:33 AND SO HOPEFULLY IN PARTNERSHIP WITH PUBLIC WORKS AND WITH OUR OTHER 
19:59:36 DEPARTMENTS, WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO COBBLE TOGETHER SOME ADDITIONAL AREAS 
19:59:43 THAT WE CAN MAKE SOME REAL TRACTION, ESPECIALLY AS WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE 
19:59:46 -- YEAR PARK MASTER PLAN UPDATE AND ALSO THE TRAIL PLAN.

19:59:49 SO I JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I'M REALLY  HOPEFUL FOR.

19:59:59 THANK YOU FOR THOSE COMMENTS AND THE INSIGHT FOR TODAY, AS WELL AS THOSE 
20:00:00 THINKING AND BEING THOUGHTFUL.

20:00:04 I ALSO WANTED TO APPLAUD AND I KNOW VICE MAYOR SALWAN HAD MENTIONED IT AND 
20:00:08 THANK MY FELLOW COUNCILMEMBERS FOR THE THOUGHTFULNESS IN LOOKING AT 
20:00:11 ADDRESSING THE UNFUNDED LIABILITIES, WHICH MADE A DECISION SEVERAL YEARS 
20:00:16 AGO AS A COUNCIL TO MAKE A CONCERTED EFFORT, AND FROM THE PERSPECTIVE THAT 
20:00:21 SOMETIMES IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE A LOT OF IMPACT, BUT WHAT WE'RE DOING IS, WE'VE 
20:00:25 TALKED ABOUT THE ALLIGATOR MOUTH IN THE PAST AND WE'D RATHER TRY TO ADDRESS 
20:00:31 AND PAY DOWN THOSE DEBTS NOW SO THAT DOESN'T BECOME A I'D RATHER PAY ARE 
20:00:37  YOU FOR THE HAMBURGER TODAY RATHER THAN LATER IN THE FUTURE.

20:00:40 SO THANK YOU FOR THAT  THOUGHTFULNESS TOO AND I WANT TODAY THANK MY COUNCIL 
20:00:41 ON THAT.

20:00:41 OKAY.

20:00:45 SEEING -- IS THIS AN ACTION ITEM?

20:00:47 I THINK IT'S A REPORT OUT.

20:00:53 >> Ms. Gauthier: MAYOR, THERE  IS --

20:00:54 >> Mayor Mei: OH, CAN I GET A MOTION?

20:00:57 COUNCILMEMBER COX, DID YOU WANT TO MAKE A MOTION OR DID YOU HAVE ADDITIONAL 
20:00:58 COMMENTS?

20:00:59 >> Councilmember Cox: I HAD SOME ADDITIONAL COMMENTS.

20:01:07 WITH THE -- I WANT TO FIRST THANK DAVID, DAVE, FOR YOUR TEAM AND THE 
20:01:10 DETAIL WORK THAT YOU'VE DONE TO PRESENT EVERYTHING TONIGHT.

20:01:17 AND I'M JUST CURIOUS TO FIND  OUT, I KNOW THE RECOMMENDATION THAT HAS BEEN 
20:01:23 PRESENTED BEFORE US WAS FOR THE $21.8 MILLION TO TRANSFER THE CAPITAL 
20:01:24  IMPROVEMENT FUNDS.

20:01:31 I WANTED TO FIND OUT IF THERE'S ANY OTHER PART OF THIS MONEY, IS THERE A 
20:01:38 WAY TO ACCOUNT FOR OTHER HUMAN SERVICES OR ANYTHING THAT COULD BE A POTENTIAL 
20:01:46 PANDEMIC OR SOMETHING THAT COULD BE -- SOME WAY TO HEDGE A LITTLE BIT MORE IN 
20:01:52 TERMS OF THERE'S SOME UNCERTAINTY WITH FOOD AS WELL AS FUEL THAT'S HAPPENING 
20:01:59 WITH THE CURRENT WAR WITH RUSSIA AND UKRAINE THAT HAS YET TO BE REALIZED IN 
20:02:00 OUR FORECAST.

20:02:07 AND SO I KNOW YOU'RE INDICATING YOU'LL PRESENT IT IN MAY, BUT BEFORE THAT, IS 
20:02:14 THERE SOME WAY THAT WE COULD HAVE SOME EXTRA RESERVES FOR HELPING THE 
20:02:19 COMMUNITY IN THESE UNCERTAIN TIMES, BECAUSE WE REALLY HAVEN'T SEEN THE 
20:02:25 FULL IMPACT, AND I'M HEARING A LOT, BESIDES FUEL -- THERE'S A LOT OF FOOD 
20:02:30 SHORTAGES, IF WE'RE GOING TO PROVIDE FOOD TO OUR SENIORS, AND ALSO IMPACTS 
20:02:34 THROUGHOUT THE CITY FOR JUST BASIC NEEDS THERE.

20:02:41 SO -- AND ALSO WE DON'T KNOW IF THERE COULD BE ANOTHER TYPE OF PANDEMIC, GOD 
20:02:41 FORBID.

20:02:46 WE HOPE NOT, BUT JUST IN PLANNING SOME OTHER WAYS TO TRY TO HELP THE 
20:02:51 COMMUNITY AND NOT TRANSFER EVERYTHING INTO THE CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT FUNDS, 
20:02:55 BUT HAVING SOMETHING ELSE JUST TO ALLOW US TO HELP OUR RESIDENTS.

20:03:02 >> Mr. Persselin: SO I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT AS I MENTIONED EARLIER, THE 
20:03:09 CITY HAS A CONTINGENCY RESERVE OF $36 MILLION, WHICH COULD BE DRAWN ON FOR 
20:03:10 UNFORESEEN EVENTS.

20:03:16 WE ALSO HAVE THE BUDGET UNCERTAINTY RESERVE OF $10 MILLION, WHICH WE COULD 
20:03:23 DRAW ON, AND THEN FINALLY, I WOULD NOTE THAT ALTHOUGH WE'RE ASKING COUNCIL TO 
20:03:29 TRANSFER $21 MILLION TO THE CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT FUND, THAT'S ONLY A 
20:03:37 PORTION OF WHAT WE ARE ANTICIPATING AS THE EXCESS OF REVENUES OVER 
20:03:38 EXPENDITURES IN THE CURRENT YEAR.

20:03:43 SO WE'RE LEAVING ABOUT $16 MILLION ON THE TABLE.

20:03:50 A PORTION OF THAT, WE WOULD BE PLANNING TO PROGRAM AND BRING FORWARD AS ONE 
20:03:57 TIME EXPENDITURES WITH THE 22-23 PROPOSED OPERATING BUDGET, BUT TO THE 
20:04:01 EXTENT THAT IN THE CURRENT YEAR, IF STAFF WERE TO BRING FORWARD ONE-TIME 
20:04:08 PROPOSALS FOR THE CURRENT YEAR, WE WOULD BE ABLE TO RECOGNIZE ADDITIONAL 
20:04:11 REVENUE AND ALLOCATE IT FOR THOSE PURPOSES.

20:04:17 I DO WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT THE AMOUNT THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FOR THE 
20:04:24 CURRENT YEAR, THAT 37 OR $38 MILLION TOTAL, IS ONE TIME IN NATURE.

20:04:31 SO IT'S PERFECTLY APPROPRIATE TO USE THAT FOR THINGS LIKE CAPITAL PROJECTS 
20:04:37 OR OTHER ONE-TIME USES, BUT WE WOULDN'T WANT TO BE TRYING TO PROGRAM ONE-TIME 
20:04:40 MONEY FOR ANY TYPE OF AN ONGOING PROGRAM.

20:04:42 >> Councilmember Cox: GOT IT.

20:04:42 OKAY.

20:04:44 THANK YOU FOR THE CLARIFICATION THEN.

20:04:45 THAT CHANGES MY ANSWER.

20:04:45 OKAY.

20:04:47 I'M READY TO MAKE A MOTION.

20:04:53 >> Mayor Mei: I ALSO SEE NOW VICE MAYOR SALWAN'S HAND.

20:04:56 IS IT FOR THE MOTION OR DID YOU HAVE AN ADDITIONAL COMMENT?

20:05:01 >> Vice Mayor Salwan: I WAS GOING TO MAKE A MOTION BUT I'M HAPPY TO SECOND 
20:05:02 COUNCILMEMBER COX' MOTION.

20:05:06 IT'S "WOMAN'S DAY," SO --

20:05:07 >> Councilmember Cox: THANK YOU.

20:05:12 >> Mayor Mei: SO I SEE A MOTION AND A SECOND.

20:05:16 I ALSO JUST WANTED TO MAKE ONE MORE COMMENT BECAUSE I THINK COUNCILMEMBER 
20:05:23 COX ASKED ABOUT THE CIPs, AND I WAS GOING TO SAY THE ONE THING I'M HOPING 
20:05:27 WE CAN STILL FOCUS ON AND I DON'T SEE HANDS ON TONIGHT BUT -- IS THAT WE ARE 
20:05:32 ALSO TRYING VERY HARD TO HAVE THE ELECTRIFICATION OF OUR FLEET SO THAT'S 
20:05:38 ANOTHER EFFORT THAT I THINK WILL HELP ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS ABOUT --

20:05:40 >> Councilmember Cox: I'M IN THAT BUSINESS OF ELECTRIFICATION AND THE 
20:05:41 PRICES HAVE GONE UP AS WELL.

20:05:45 SO WE'VE JUST GOT TO BE COGNIZANT OF ALL OF THAT.

20:05:46 I'M AWARE OF THAT AS WELL.

20:05:46 THANK YOU.

20:05:54 >> Mayor Mei: TO, SO I DON'T SEE COUNCILMEMBER -- NOT -- DIRECTOR 
20:05:58 LARSEN ON THERE, BUT I THINK IT WOULD BE GREAT AS WE TRY TO SECURE SOME OF 
20:06:02 THE GRANTS FROM THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY  COMMISSION, ALSO THE BAY AREA AIR 
20:06:02 QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT.

20:06:04 SO THAT WOULD BE WONDERFUL.

20:06:07 >> City Mgr. Shackelford: IT'S DEFINITELY ON OUR RADAR.

20:06:09 THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THAT UP, MAYOR MEI.

20:06:10 >> Mayor Mei: THANK YOU.

20:06:14 SO WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND.

20:06:15 ROLL CALL, PLEASE.

20:06:17 >> Ms. Gauthier: COUNCILMEMBER COX, AYE.

20:06:18 COUNCILMEMBER SHAO, AYE.

20:06:20 COUNCILMEMBER KASSAN, AYE.

20:06:24 COUNCILMEMBER JONES, AYE.

20:06:27 COUNCILMEMBER KENG, AYE.

20:06:29 VICE MAYOR SALWAN, AYE.

20:06:31 MAYOR MEI, AYE.

20:06:34 SO THE MOTION CARRIES UNANIMOUSLY.

20:06:44 NEXT ON OUR AGENDA THIS EVENING IS ORAL REPORTS ON MEETINGS.

20:06:51 FOR THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN ATTENDING ANY OF THE MEETINGS OR COMMISSIONS THAT 
20:06:55 ARE RELATED TO THE CITY, IF YOU'D LIKE TO SHARE ANY OF YOUR REPORTS OUT FROM 
20:06:55 COMMITTEE MEETINGS.

20:07:12 WELL, I DON'T SEE ONES FROM THE COMMITTEES.

20:07:15 I WANTED TO SHARE ONE BRIEF ONE OUT THIS EVENING.

20:07:23 I HAVE THE HONOR OF SUPPORTING AND REPRESENTING ON THE U.S. CONFERENCE OF 
20:07:30 MAYORS, AND THIS PAST WEEK WE HAD MEETINGS AND WE HEARD DIRECTLY FROM 
20:07:36 THE MAYOR OF KYIV, AS WELL AS THE AMBASSADOR FOR THE UKRAINES, AND IT 
20:07:42 WAS VERY MOVING, AND THEY WANT TO SHARE THE MESSAGE TO THANK THE AMERICAN 
20:07:46 PEOPLE, AND ESPECIALLY OUR FELLOW MAYORS AS WE'RE THE CLOSEST TO THE 
20:07:46 COMMUNITIES.

20:07:49 AND -- THE COUNCILMEMBERS TOO.

20:07:55 SO THEY WANTED TO DISCUSS WITH US HOW HARD IT IS, AND THEY APPRECIATE THE 
20:08:02 EFFORTS FOR FREEDOM AND DEMOCRACY AND THE FIGHT TO HELP PROVIDE THAT, AND 
20:08:06 HOW THEY CANNOT LIVE WITHOUT THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE.

20:08:10 AND SO AS SUCH IN SOLIDARITY, I WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW THAT THE U.S. 
20:08:16 CONFERENCE OF MAYORS, AND I WAS PROUD TO JOIN THAT, MADE A PLEDGE IN 
20:08:20 SUPPORT, IN  SOLIDARITY, WITH THE PEOPLE OF THE UKRAINE.

20:08:30 AND THAT WE STAND WITH THEM IN THEIR RIGHT TO HAVE FREEDOM AND CONDEMN 
20:08:33 CONDEMNATION OF THE BEHAVIOR THAT HAS HIT THE UKRAINE PEOPLE.

20:08:37 SO I'D BE HAPPY TO SHARE THAT PROCLAMATION THAT WAS SIGNED BY ALL 
20:08:39 THE MAYORS THAT WERE IN ATTENDANCE AT THE MEETING.

20:08:47 AND THAT WE STAND IN SOLIDARITY TO MAKE SURE THAT AS WE HAVE IN THE PAST AS A 
20:08:51 COMPASSIONATE CITY THAT WE STAND IN SUPPORT OF THOSE WHO ARE IN NEED AT 
20:08:52 THIS MOMENT.

20:08:58 AND SO I JUST WANTED TO SHARE THAT FROM THE U.S. CONFERENCE OF MAYORS, HOW 
20:09:00 IMPORTANT IT IS.

20:09:06 AND THEN ALSO I REPRESENT US ON SOME TECHNOLOGY AREAS, AND TODAY WE ALSO 
20:09:11 HAD -- I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE WITH THE TELECOM COUNCIL ON SOME OF 
20:09:16 THE EFFORTS THAT FREMONT AS A CITY ARE IMPLEMENTING IN TERMS OF 5G, AND SOME 
20:09:22 OF THE EFFORTS WORKING WITH MASTER LEASE AGREEMENT AND OUR SMALL CELL 
20:09:25 AGREEMENTS, AND I KNOW PEOPLE HAVE ASKED ABOUT AWARENESS OF THESE TYPES 
20:09:32 OF EFFORTS AND IMPACTS, AND THAT'S WHY OUR CITY HAS BEEN RESPONSIVE IN THE 
20:09:37 PAST AND ALSO LISTENED TO THESE CONCERNS AND CREATED THIS SMALL CELL 
20:09:42 GIS VIEWER MAP, SO I'D STRONGLY ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO USE THAT, AND THEN 
20:09:47 FINALLY, I KNOW WE'VE HEARD MANY TIMES FROM PEOPLE ON THE REQUESTs FOR 
20:09:51 CONCERNS OR HOW TO REPORT A CONCERN, WHETHER IT HOMELESSNESS THAT WE'VE 
20:09:56 HEARD IN PUBLIC COMMENTS OR OTHER AREAS, AND I STRONGLY ENCOURAGE AND 
20:10:04 WOULD LOVE TO ENCOURAGE, I THINK WE'RE COMING ON TWO YEARS OF OUR REPORT A 
20:10:06 CONCERN TOOL IN THE FREMONT APP.

20:10:11 I THINK WE'VE RESPONDED TO DATE IN THESE PAST TWO YEARS TO OVER 2500 
20:10:17 REQUESTS, AND WE'VE  RESOLVED A LOT OF THOSE TICKETS AND AGAIN, I STRONGLY 
20:10:21 ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO UTILIZE THAT APP BECAUSE IT THEN ALLOWS PEOPLE TO HAVE 
20:10:28 THEIR SELF CONTROL OF CREATING A TICKET AND ROUTING TO THE DEPARTMENT THAT'S 
20:10:31 APPROPRIATE AND YOU CAN TRACK YOUR TICKET AND TO GET THE FEEDBACK AND TO 
20:10:32 SEE THAT ANALYSIS.

20:10:36 SO I JUST WANTED TO THANK STAFF FOR THAT EXTRA EFFORT AND THANK THE CITY 
20:10:44 MANAGER AND STAP STAFF, PART OF OUR INITIATION TO CREATE MORE 
20:10:46 COMMUNICATION WITH THE PUBLIC.

20:10:48 ARE THERE ANY OTHER COMMENTS?

20:10:52 SEEING NONE, THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR HELP.

20:11:01 I WISH ALL THE FELLOW WOMEN ON THE COUNCIL AS WELL AS ON OUR STAFF A 
20:11:04 HAPPY INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY AND HAPPY WOMEN'S MONTH.

20:11:09 THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP AND FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND PARTNERSHIP IN 
20:11:10 SUPPORTING OUR COMMUNITIES IN WORKING TOGETHER.

20:11:13 BE WELL, STAY SAFE, AND STAY HEALTHY.
