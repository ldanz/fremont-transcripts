The city is (as of this writing) currently running meetings over Zoom rather than in-person.  City Council and Planning Comission meetings employ a stenographer who transcribes the meeting in real time, and this shows up in the Zoom closed captions, which allow viewers to save the transcripts.  The transcripts on this site have been saved by community members who dialed into the meeting and used the save-transcript feature.

Some transcripts may be missing or incomplete.  If you have a more complete version of a transcript that's missing or incomplete, feel free to open a pull request on the gh-pages branch of [github.com/ldanz/fremont-transcripts](https://github.com/ldanz/fremont-transcripts).
